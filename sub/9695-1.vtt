00:29.323 --> 00:31.553
Nothing is more inspiring

00:31.658 --> 00:34.593
Than the tale of a sports hero.

00:34.695 --> 00:38.358
But this story is
about the other guy...

00:38.465 --> 00:40.723
The LOSER.

00:40.834 --> 00:43.860
And as you'll see,
even failure has its champion.

00:43.971 --> 00:45.370
His name?

00:45.472 --> 00:46.905
Lambeau Fields.

00:47.007 --> 00:48.440
To me, he's a hero,

00:48.542 --> 00:50.373
An inspiration and a friend.

00:50.477 --> 00:52.172
To the rest of the world,

00:52.279 --> 00:55.305
He's the worst coach
in the history of sports.

00:55.416 --> 00:56.713
Hey, Bill!

00:56.817 --> 00:58.148
Buckner!

00:58.252 --> 00:59.378
What?

00:59.486 --> 01:00.646
What's a six-Letter word

01:00.754 --> 01:01.948
For a tropical fruit?

01:02.056 --> 01:03.421
Not now.

01:03.524 --> 01:05.388
I'm thinking
it might be "banana"!

01:05.492 --> 01:07.050
Zip it. Be quiet.

01:07.161 --> 01:08.753
Could be "papaya"!

01:08.862 --> 01:10.830
Fields, this is the World Series, man-
Are you crazy?

01:10.931 --> 01:13.331
Slow roller down to first.

01:13.434 --> 01:15.595
It gets through Buckner's legs!
The Mets win!

01:15.702 --> 01:16.726
The Mets win!

01:16.837 --> 01:18.600
It's "Papaya. "

01:22.443 --> 01:24.172
Let's go!

01:29.716 --> 01:31.445
Whoa!

01:33.620 --> 01:35.417
That's on me.

01:35.522 --> 01:37.456
Marco, come here.

01:37.558 --> 01:40.425
Go tell Zidane, tell him I said...

01:43.263 --> 01:46.664
Go tell him I said that.

01:46.767 --> 01:49.099
Ta mere est une
vielle... terroriste.

01:52.606 --> 01:56.098
I don't remember
saying "Chain-Smoking. "

01:56.210 --> 01:59.509
Being labeled the biggest
loser in the history of mankind

01:59.613 --> 02:02.480
Finally got
to old Coach Fields,

02:02.583 --> 02:04.608
And he hit rock bottom.

02:04.718 --> 02:05.946
Coach?

02:06.053 --> 02:07.987
Freddie.
Good to see you.

02:08.088 --> 02:09.645
My God,

02:09.756 --> 02:11.348
I hardly recognized you.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.323
I bought a new hat.

02:13.427 --> 02:14.985
Nice.

02:15.095 --> 02:17.290
It's good to see you, buddy.

02:17.397 --> 02:18.864
I got a proposition for you.

02:18.966 --> 02:20.433
All right.
Let's walk and talk.

02:20.534 --> 02:21.558
I'm late for work.

02:21.668 --> 02:22.965
Yeah.

02:23.070 --> 02:25.698
Hey, Manuel, Javier,
Sanchez, Cornelio, new guy.

02:25.806 --> 02:28.104
Hola, Coach.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.800
They ride the horses.

02:29.910 --> 02:33.641
Coach wasn't exactly coaching anymore.

02:33.747 --> 02:35.510
His job was to help facilitate

02:35.616 --> 02:37.811
The continuation of the noble
Seabiscuit lineage.

02:37.918 --> 02:39.943
It was about helping out
Mother Nature.

02:40.053 --> 02:42.078
To draw forth
the building blocks

02:42.189 --> 02:44.214
Of the champion D.N.A. Which-

02:44.324 --> 02:46.588
Aw, hell.
He was yanking off horses.

02:46.693 --> 02:49.389
So, tell me about
this big offer of yours.

02:49.496 --> 02:51.896
There's this small college
in Plainfolk, Texas-

02:51.999 --> 02:53.694
Heartland State University.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.894
It's got a beautiful campus
and awesome athletic program.

02:57.004 --> 02:58.995
They need
a new head football coach.

02:59.106 --> 03:01.768
Me go back to coaching?

03:03.510 --> 03:04.534
Oh. Sorry.

03:04.645 --> 03:06.613
Okay.

03:08.515 --> 03:09.982
Listen, Coach...

03:10.083 --> 03:13.177
You and me we've been
through wars together, right?

03:13.287 --> 03:14.982
And no matter what anybody says,

03:15.088 --> 03:17.556
I mean, you're one
of the best leaders ever.

03:17.658 --> 03:19.558
It's time for you
to get back into coaching.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.093
I appreciate it,

03:21.195 --> 03:22.526
But I'm happy here.

03:22.629 --> 03:25.257
For once in my life,
I'm proud of what I'm doing.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.967
I said no!
No means no!

03:30.070 --> 03:32.334
You know what no means.

03:32.439 --> 03:35.306
Aah! You just finish yourself.

03:35.409 --> 03:36.740
Aah!

03:36.843 --> 03:38.367
Thanks anyway, buddy.

03:38.478 --> 03:41.379
Good to see ya.

03:41.481 --> 03:43.813
Uh, I shouldn't, 'cause,
you know...

03:43.917 --> 03:45.407
I got a terrible cold.

03:47.521 --> 03:50.456
Coming up on Fox Sports News,
Maria Sharapova battles

03:50.557 --> 03:52.957
The mighty Venus Williams
at the Australian Open.

04:01.602 --> 04:03.502
Here, Maria!

04:03.604 --> 04:06.266
Smile! - Right here!

04:06.373 --> 04:07.601
WOMAN
Coach?

04:07.708 --> 04:09.972
There you are.

04:11.878 --> 04:14.438
Is something wrong?

04:14.548 --> 04:17.540
Freddie Wiseman
came to see me today.

04:17.651 --> 04:19.676
Told me about a coaching job.

04:19.786 --> 04:21.253
College football.

04:21.355 --> 04:23.323
But I said no.

04:23.423 --> 04:25.584
I told him I'm out.

04:25.692 --> 04:28.183
Sweetie...

04:28.295 --> 04:29.284
Are you sure?

04:29.396 --> 04:31.887
I mean, coaching
is in your blood.

04:31.999 --> 04:35.265
Like-Like hepatitis C or...
or traces of cocaine.

04:36.571 --> 04:38.471
I don't know, Barb.

04:38.573 --> 04:40.700
It would mean moving again.

04:40.808 --> 04:43.276
You know, this house
is perfect for us.

04:43.378 --> 04:44.845
Look at this den.

04:44.946 --> 04:46.140
It's already filled

04:46.247 --> 04:48.215
With sports memorabilia
and trophies.

04:48.316 --> 04:49.578
You know,
it's not too late

04:49.684 --> 04:51.618
For you to get
a trophy of your own.

04:51.719 --> 04:54.313
That'd be something, wouldn't it?

04:54.422 --> 04:56.481
Oh, come on.

04:56.591 --> 04:59.082
Coaching is
a Fields family tradition

04:59.193 --> 05:02.651
Like cockfighting
or identity theft.

05:02.764 --> 05:04.561
That's true.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.798
Maybe I will
give it another shot.

05:10.038 --> 05:11.938
Yeah! You can't keep a legend

05:12.040 --> 05:14.304
In the shadows for long.

05:14.409 --> 05:16.138
Set!

05:16.244 --> 05:17.871
Hut!

05:17.979 --> 05:19.469
Honey...

05:21.616 --> 05:23.584
Honey, honey,

05:23.685 --> 05:25.016
Honey, um...

05:25.119 --> 05:28.577
Just promise me that you
won't get so consumed by winning

05:28.690 --> 05:30.817
That you completely forget
about this family.

05:30.925 --> 05:32.358
What?!

05:32.460 --> 05:34.257
Family comes first.

05:34.362 --> 05:35.590
You know that.

05:35.697 --> 05:37.824
Really?
And how many of Michelle's

05:37.932 --> 05:40.457
Gymnastics meets
have you been to?

05:40.568 --> 05:41.557
Michelle?

05:41.669 --> 05:42.829
Your daughter.

05:42.937 --> 05:44.404
Oh, of course, Michelle.

05:46.107 --> 05:47.233
What the hell was that?

05:47.342 --> 05:48.274
Your son.

05:48.376 --> 05:49.104
Scruffy!

05:49.210 --> 05:50.404
Jeffrey!

05:50.511 --> 05:51.978
Well, someone's name is Scruffy.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.514
Scruffy was your dog
when you were ten. I...

05:54.615 --> 05:56.947
See, honey, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

06:02.290 --> 06:03.848
Hello.

06:03.958 --> 06:05.550
Sorry, wrong number.

06:07.228 --> 06:09.128
That was the police.

06:09.230 --> 06:11.858
They're looking for the parents
of a girl named Michelle.

06:11.966 --> 06:13.297
What?

06:13.401 --> 06:17.030
Don't worry, sweetie.

06:17.138 --> 06:19.197
We're gonna get through this.

06:19.307 --> 06:22.572
Honey, that's not Michelle.

06:26.247 --> 06:28.408
Michelle Fields,

06:28.516 --> 06:30.609
You have been charged
with property damage,

06:30.718 --> 06:35.246
Robbery, arson,
indecent exposure

06:35.356 --> 06:37.950
And being
an insatiable cock tease.

06:38.059 --> 06:41.051
That got a lot
of hits on YouTube.

06:41.162 --> 06:42.220
Therefore,

06:42.330 --> 06:44.992
I hereby sentence you to rejoin

06:45.099 --> 06:47.863
The USA Gymnastics Team.

06:47.969 --> 06:48.936
No!

06:49.036 --> 06:50.663
Why would you do this to me?

06:52.140 --> 06:54.074
Hey, Tommy B.
Yeah, Lawdog here.

06:54.175 --> 06:56.541
Listen, I wanna put 50 grand
on the US womens gymnastic team

06:56.644 --> 06:58.111
To win the gold in Beijing.

06:58.212 --> 07:00.077
Thanks, buddy.

07:05.186 --> 07:07.211
Oh, shit.

07:07.321 --> 07:08.982
I have my reasons.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.420
This is all your fault!

07:12.527 --> 07:14.427
Oh, sweet Jesus.

07:16.297 --> 07:18.094
How could this happen?

07:19.700 --> 07:22.168
It's okay, Coach,
it's all right.

07:22.270 --> 07:23.760
We'll get through this.

07:23.871 --> 07:25.395
We're getting a ticket!

07:25.506 --> 07:27.269
I knew that was
a loading zone!

07:27.375 --> 07:28.933
So Coach took the job

07:29.043 --> 07:31.910
At Heartland State and made
a promise to his family

07:32.013 --> 07:33.071
That he wouldn't forget 'em.

07:33.181 --> 07:34.512
- Wait! Wait a second!
- Dad, wait up!

07:35.616 --> 07:38.016
- Dad!
- Coach!

07:38.119 --> 07:40.587
#You take one down
You pass it around#

07:40.688 --> 07:43.623
They settled in Plainfolk, Texas.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.624
A sleepy little town,

07:45.726 --> 07:48.695
So cozy that it didn't even
have a traffic light.

07:51.466 --> 07:54.799
#No more bottles
of beer on the wall #

07:54.969 --> 07:57.199
Coach Fields was
back in the game-

07:57.305 --> 08:00.866
But this time, he really had
his work cut out for him.

08:00.975 --> 08:03.409
Welcome to your
first practice, gentlemen.

08:03.511 --> 08:07.379
Hope you're ready for the worst
six weeks of your life.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.677
I'm gonna do things
to your bodies

08:10.785 --> 08:13.913
That are cruel,
painful and unnatural.

08:14.021 --> 08:17.582
I'm gonna ride your ass

08:17.692 --> 08:20.820
Day and night.

08:20.928 --> 08:22.555
I'm gonna make you bleed

08:22.663 --> 08:24.858
From places that you've
never bled from before.

08:25.967 --> 08:27.992
It's gonna hurt bad.

08:29.270 --> 08:32.398
It's gonna hurt deep.

08:33.508 --> 08:35.373
Then it's gonna start
to feel good.

08:36.977 --> 08:39.275
Then it's gonna hurt again.

08:42.216 --> 08:45.014
Now, I need to get this team
down to a 32-Man roster,

08:45.119 --> 08:47.417
Which means some of you ladies
are gonna be cut.

08:47.522 --> 08:50.082
Starting with you, you

08:50.191 --> 08:51.783
- And you.
- Hey, Coach, we didn't even

08:51.893 --> 08:53.258
Get a chance to play yet.

08:53.361 --> 08:55.352
If there's one thing
I can spot, it's talent.

08:55.463 --> 08:57.397
Coach, we're the only players
on this team who can play.

08:57.498 --> 08:59.193
Wait, man, how do you
think you get these?

08:59.300 --> 09:00.961
- Huh?
- EBay.

09:02.336 --> 09:03.633
Maybe next year, guys.

09:03.738 --> 09:05.399
Thanks for coming out.

09:05.506 --> 09:07.497
All right, let's see if I've got

09:07.608 --> 09:10.008
Anybody else out here
worth a damn.

09:10.111 --> 09:11.874
Randy Randinger!

09:11.979 --> 09:13.674
- Here, Coach.
- Where?

09:13.781 --> 09:14.907
Right here, sir.

09:15.016 --> 09:17.007
I'm ready to give it my all.

09:17.118 --> 09:19.211
I'll do whatever it
takes to make this team.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.345
Refill the waters,
get fresh towels...

09:21.455 --> 09:23.218
Buff everyone's helmet.

09:24.592 --> 09:26.321
Oh...

09:26.427 --> 09:27.621
That helmet.

09:27.728 --> 09:29.855
I thought you were talking
about something else.

09:29.964 --> 09:31.454
Good. We got a towel boy.

09:31.566 --> 09:32.533
Next-

09:32.633 --> 09:34.498
Buddy Boy Jones!

09:34.602 --> 09:36.593
All right! I got me

09:36.704 --> 09:38.763
A big, mean son of a bitch!

09:38.873 --> 09:42.240
I wouldn't
hurt a fly, Coach.

09:42.343 --> 09:43.708
Football is war, son.

09:43.811 --> 09:45.574
You got to be a killer.

09:47.582 --> 09:49.379
Ow!

09:49.483 --> 09:51.383
I'm telling on you!

09:53.721 --> 09:56.121
Next, ACL Tear!

09:57.725 --> 10:00.023
It's pronounced "Aseel," sir.

10:00.127 --> 10:01.719
Aseel Tare.

10:01.829 --> 10:03.820
ACL Tear. Got it.

10:03.931 --> 10:07.367
It says here you rushed for
a thousand yards last season.

10:07.468 --> 10:09.698
Keep it up,
you could turn pro.

10:09.804 --> 10:10.771
Hope so, Coach.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.771
Nothing can hold you back.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.273
Except an unforeseen
career-Ending injury.

10:15.376 --> 10:18.777
What are the odds
of that happening, ACL Tear?

10:18.879 --> 10:21.177
It's Aseel, sir. Aseel Tare.

10:22.516 --> 10:24.984
Got it. ACL Tear.

10:25.086 --> 10:27.145
Right there.

10:27.254 --> 10:28.915
Is that a radio I hear?

10:29.023 --> 10:30.217
No, that's just I Pod.

10:37.098 --> 10:38.326
Whoa!

10:40.067 --> 10:41.898
God, what a retarded
ass retard.

10:43.404 --> 10:44.598
Hey!

10:44.705 --> 10:47.196
I don't ever want
to hear that word again!

10:47.308 --> 10:48.900
You're talking about a person,

10:49.010 --> 10:51.103
A human being!

10:51.212 --> 10:52.679
Come here, son.

10:53.781 --> 10:56.011
He may be a
moronic cretin,

10:56.117 --> 10:57.675
A drooling mush head,

10:57.785 --> 10:59.685
A short bus-Riding,
window-Licking

10:59.787 --> 11:01.277
Spaz-Ass simpleton,

11:01.389 --> 11:03.914
But he is not a retard.

11:04.025 --> 11:05.788
If there's one thing
I do not tolerate,

11:05.893 --> 11:07.520
That's disrespect.

11:08.562 --> 11:11.998
Okay, I Pod.

11:13.467 --> 11:15.435
How'd you like
to be my assistant?

11:17.204 --> 11:18.398
Yeah.

11:18.506 --> 11:20.872
Let this be a lesson
for all of you.

11:20.975 --> 11:23.603
You judge not,
lest ye be judged.

11:23.711 --> 11:26.874
It's time someone
gives this man a chance.

11:26.981 --> 11:28.448
To once and for all
show that-

11:28.549 --> 11:31.347
Okay, that's enough.
All right, get him off me.

11:31.519 --> 11:32.508
Get him off me.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.389
Here comes Trotter, here comes Trotter.

11:45.499 --> 11:46.966
Here come who?

11:47.068 --> 11:49.400
Trotter, Trotter, he's a star.

11:49.503 --> 11:51.630
Touchdown, Trotter, touchdown.

11:51.739 --> 11:53.536
What's this all about?

11:53.641 --> 11:55.165
What's it to you, old man?

11:55.276 --> 11:57.141
This "old man"
is your new coach.

11:57.244 --> 11:58.802
I want you suited up

11:58.913 --> 12:01.609
In two minutes,
or you're off my squad.

12:01.716 --> 12:04.048
Looks like we
gonna have us a problem, then.

12:04.151 --> 12:06.278
You know that, right?

12:07.988 --> 12:09.455
Figurin' out what
to do with the other

12:09.557 --> 12:10.649
Minute and 99 seconds.

12:20.267 --> 12:21.962
Let's get something
straight, Trotter.

12:22.069 --> 12:25.266
I don't like the ego,
I don't like the flash,

12:25.372 --> 12:27.306
I don't like that...
my daughter is

12:27.408 --> 12:28.807
Coming out of your limo.

12:28.909 --> 12:29.967
Damn!

12:30.077 --> 12:31.738
What are you doing in there?

12:31.846 --> 12:34.280
Just, um, getting
a ride to school

12:34.381 --> 12:36.281
With my new boyfriend

12:36.383 --> 12:38.613
And... lover.

12:39.687 --> 12:40.915
Oh, please,

12:41.021 --> 12:43.148
This is just another one
of your rebellious stunts

12:43.257 --> 12:44.417
Trying to make me mad.

12:44.525 --> 12:46.152
It's not a stunt, Dad.

12:46.260 --> 12:49.320
It's just me
having a boyfriend...

12:49.430 --> 12:51.830
Who happens to be black.

12:53.934 --> 12:55.731
See you later.

12:58.005 --> 13:00.633
Black boyfriend.

13:00.741 --> 13:03.005
Damn!

13:03.110 --> 13:04.771
All right!

13:04.879 --> 13:06.972
Any walk-Ons?

13:08.883 --> 13:10.510
Hey, Coach.

13:10.618 --> 13:12.313
Name is Vince.

13:13.554 --> 13:14.851
I'm just a bartender from Philly

13:14.955 --> 13:16.286
Whose only dream
is to play ball.

13:16.390 --> 13:18.517
It's all I got left

13:18.626 --> 13:21.288
After I lost my job teaching
and my wife left me.

13:21.395 --> 13:24.057
Like my alcoholic father
used to say before he passed on,

13:24.165 --> 13:27.566
"A man can only take
so much failure!"

13:27.668 --> 13:30.762
I promise to give you
everything I got.

13:30.871 --> 13:32.237
What do you say, Coach?

13:34.176 --> 13:37.634
I say you can add
"Did not make the football team"

13:37.746 --> 13:39.543
To your list of woes.

13:39.648 --> 13:42.173
Now beat it, buzzkill.

13:46.354 --> 13:48.254
Okay, ladies, show time!

13:48.356 --> 13:50.256
Offense, hit the line!

13:50.358 --> 13:52.019
Defense, give 'em hell!

13:52.127 --> 13:54.220
Let's see what you boys got!

13:54.329 --> 13:56.024
Not you.

13:58.133 --> 14:00.226
FIELDS
All right!

14:03.872 --> 14:05.840
Hike the damn ball!

14:08.243 --> 14:10.837
I suppose we don't have a quarterback.

14:14.115 --> 14:16.345
All right!

14:16.451 --> 14:18.385
Still don't have a quarterback.

14:18.486 --> 14:20.579
Any other positions
we need to fill?

14:20.689 --> 14:23.021
We need a kicker.
Can I be kicker, Coach?

14:23.124 --> 14:24.421
I'll steam up your wiener

14:24.526 --> 14:26.426
And stick it
between my buns.

14:29.965 --> 14:31.796
Oh.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.424
That wiener.

14:33.602 --> 14:36.264
Yeah, this is great.

14:36.371 --> 14:38.362
Middle of Bumfuck, Nowhere.

14:38.473 --> 14:41.306
How am I gonna find
an all-American quarterback?

14:41.409 --> 14:45.072
If you build it, he will come.

14:47.849 --> 14:51.046
If you build it, he will

14:51.152 --> 14:53.484
Come...

14:53.588 --> 14:54.816
Who will come?

14:54.923 --> 14:58.017
Your father. Your dead father.

14:58.126 --> 14:59.718
My father's not dead.

14:59.828 --> 15:01.557
I just spoke with him
this morning.

15:01.663 --> 15:03.221
You got to be shittin' me.

15:03.331 --> 15:05.231
Is this 314 Bentley Road?

15:05.333 --> 15:07.460
No, this is 314 Bentley Drive.

15:07.569 --> 15:10.595
Fucking MapQuest.
I've got to get G.P.S.

15:10.705 --> 15:12.832
Anyway, I know a quarterback.
His name is Lance Truman.

15:12.941 --> 15:15.000
You'll find his ass
on the baseball field.

15:25.820 --> 15:26.844
Lance Truman?

15:26.955 --> 15:28.081
Yeah.

15:28.189 --> 15:29.520
Name's Lambeau Fields.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.353
New football coach
over at Heartland.

15:31.459 --> 15:33.154
Word on the street

15:33.261 --> 15:34.922
Is that you're
a damn good quarterback.

15:35.030 --> 15:37.225
Yeah, my dad wants me
to focus on baseball.

15:37.332 --> 15:38.424
Sorry, Coach.

15:38.533 --> 15:40.330
Let me talk to your father.

15:40.435 --> 15:43.529
He needs to know that
you're wasting your gift here.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.072
All right, listen, could we
just drop the football thing?

15:46.174 --> 15:48.438
My dad's made up his mind-
Baseball's my future.

15:48.543 --> 15:50.909
Then prove it-
Strike me out.

15:51.012 --> 15:51.979
Are you serious?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.308
Your best pitch.

15:53.415 --> 15:54.404
You got some wood?

15:54.516 --> 15:57.451
No. But I did on the way
over here, though.

15:57.552 --> 16:00.521
Sometimes when I'm driving,
I like to prop a cup of coffee

16:00.622 --> 16:03.386
In my lap, and there's just
something about the hot steam

16:03.491 --> 16:04.719
Against my knuckleballs

16:04.826 --> 16:06.691
That really, you know...

16:06.795 --> 16:09.059
Just makes old Charlie hustle.

16:09.164 --> 16:10.495
Yeah, that kind of wood.

16:10.598 --> 16:11.895
- Right.
- Right.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.299
That's it. Thought for a second
you were talking about cock.

16:59.814 --> 17:01.782
I put everything I had on that.

17:01.883 --> 17:04.875
It's time we go talk
to your dad.

17:09.057 --> 17:11.423
Got a good feeling
about this year.

17:11.526 --> 17:14.494
By the way, where's
the closest hospital?

17:14.596 --> 17:16.826
Uh... County General. Why?

17:16.931 --> 17:18.159
Oh, no reason.

17:18.266 --> 17:21.030
I'm just gonna pop in there,
grab an aspirin.

17:21.136 --> 17:23.604
Got a little headache, I guess.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.104
Oh!

17:28.209 --> 17:30.939
Oh! Ee!

17:32.147 --> 17:33.944
Well, I'm sorry you had to drive

17:34.049 --> 17:36.381
All the way out here, Fields.
I could've told you

17:36.484 --> 17:39.214
Over the phone I wasn't gonna
let my boy play football.

17:44.526 --> 17:46.426
Have you always
drank this much,

17:46.528 --> 17:48.587
Mr. Truman?

17:48.696 --> 17:52.359
No. Went for 11 straight years
without a drink.

17:52.467 --> 17:53.661
What happened?

17:53.768 --> 17:55.463
Turned 12.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.739
I really wish you'd
reconsider, Mr. Truman.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.933
Your son had a great
season last year.

18:01.042 --> 18:02.703
Hell, he might have been great,

18:02.811 --> 18:05.803
If he could learn how to keep
from dropping the dang ball.

18:05.914 --> 18:07.882
- That's not true, Dad.
- Oh, no?

18:07.982 --> 18:09.643
Then what the hell is this?

18:14.222 --> 18:16.782
That's the Droppie Award
for most fumbles in a season.

18:16.891 --> 18:18.688
And what
the hell is this?

18:18.793 --> 18:22.024
That's a picture of me
at Camp Fumblewatha.

18:22.130 --> 18:24.860
And what are you eating
in that picture?

18:24.966 --> 18:27.457
A Butterfingers.

18:27.569 --> 18:28.729
This conversation is over, Coach.

18:28.837 --> 18:30.168
My boy's not playing for anyone,

18:30.271 --> 18:32.364
'Cause I can't stand
the guys at the mill

18:32.474 --> 18:36.467
Asking me why my boy can't
hold on to the goddamn ball!

18:36.578 --> 18:37.636
Dad!

18:38.980 --> 18:40.641
I just want
to make you proud, Dad,

18:40.748 --> 18:42.613
So you can hold
your head up high.

18:42.717 --> 18:44.480
Please, Dad?

18:45.954 --> 18:48.184
All right.

18:48.289 --> 18:50.655
But if you give
those men at the mill

18:50.758 --> 18:53.352
Any reason to laugh at me,
I swear to God...

18:53.461 --> 18:54.723
You work at a mill?

18:54.829 --> 18:57.389
The Sugar Mill-
It's out on Route 39.

18:57.499 --> 19:00.900
I do Cher four nights a week,
Christina Aguilera on Saturday.

19:25.260 --> 19:28.525
Isn't she the best kicker
you've ever seen?

19:31.833 --> 19:35.894
Kicker? Oh, hey, look-
They're playing sports.

19:36.004 --> 19:38.973
How you doing?
Name's Coach Fields.

19:39.073 --> 19:41.132
- I want you to be my kicker.
- Wow!

19:41.242 --> 19:42.675
I would like that very much.

19:42.777 --> 19:44.540
- So you'll join the squad?
- Under one condition:

19:44.646 --> 19:46.546
My parents can never know.

19:46.648 --> 19:48.548
They're very traditional,
believe a woman's life

19:48.650 --> 19:51.118
Should be spent in service
to her husband, cooking,

19:51.219 --> 19:52.914
Cleaning, and pleasuring
with the mouth.

19:53.021 --> 19:54.750
- Hello. Welcome to the team.
- Hi. Hi.

19:54.856 --> 19:56.346
Oh, my God.

19:56.457 --> 19:59.483
Hey, what's this thing?

19:59.594 --> 20:00.720
Oh, that's for your nose.

20:00.828 --> 20:02.193
You put it on your face.

20:02.297 --> 20:03.525
It's a nose guard.

20:07.669 --> 20:10.365
Well, I thought
it was a really small

20:10.471 --> 20:12.939
One of these.

20:20.748 --> 20:21.737
Hey.

20:21.849 --> 20:22.747
I'm Lance. Lance Truman.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.408
I'm your new quarterback.

20:24.519 --> 20:26.851
Word of advice, quarterback.

20:26.955 --> 20:30.023
You just give me the damn ball,
and you stay out of my way.

20:30.124 --> 20:31.386
This my team.

20:31.492 --> 20:32.789
This my turf.

20:32.894 --> 20:35.226
And this...

20:35.330 --> 20:37.059
This my...

20:37.165 --> 20:38.757
My Little Pony collection.

20:38.866 --> 20:41.391
Rainbow Dash, first edition.

20:41.502 --> 20:42.799
Still in the box, bitch.

20:42.904 --> 20:44.462
Huddle up! Listen up!

20:44.572 --> 20:45.971
Sit down.

20:47.709 --> 20:49.973
Been doing
a little bit of research.

20:50.078 --> 20:51.978
Turns out...

20:52.080 --> 20:54.878
Every single one of you made
the dean's list last semester.

20:54.983 --> 20:56.075
Yeah!

20:56.184 --> 21:00.348
And I got to say, gang...

21:00.455 --> 21:03.322
I will not stand
for this bullshit!

21:04.192 --> 21:06.854
Now, if we're gonna be winners,

21:06.961 --> 21:10.761
I'm gonna need
a commitment from you.

21:10.865 --> 21:14.130
So we're all gonna sign
a little contract.

21:15.503 --> 21:17.937
Why don't you
pass those out.

21:18.039 --> 21:21.531
I want to start seeing D's...

21:21.643 --> 21:23.941
And F's.

21:24.045 --> 21:26.172
I want you to cut class.

21:26.281 --> 21:28.647
I want academic probation.

21:28.750 --> 21:33.312
When I walk in that locker room,
I want to smell reefer.

21:33.421 --> 21:35.446
I want phone calls
in the middle of the night

21:35.556 --> 21:37.649
To bail you horn dogs
out of jail.

21:37.759 --> 21:39.056
I want felonies,

21:39.160 --> 21:40.991
Lawsuits,

21:41.095 --> 21:44.326
Sexual harassment allegations.

21:44.432 --> 21:47.458
I want you to start acting like
ballplayers, for Christ sake!

21:47.568 --> 21:49.399
Hey! Hey!

21:49.504 --> 21:53.338
Anybody got a problem, you
better speak up right and now!

21:55.510 --> 21:57.808
You know what I think
of your contract, Coach?

22:17.732 --> 22:19.529
You got a lot of anger, son.

22:19.634 --> 22:22.000
That's 'cause I'm from somewhere
you can't even imagine.

22:22.103 --> 22:23.263
The skreets.

22:23.371 --> 22:25.464
Dude, you grew up
two houses down from me.

22:25.573 --> 22:27.006
We lived in the same cul-De-Sac.

22:27.108 --> 22:28.974
Which is a dead-End skreet,

22:29.078 --> 22:31.012
And no hope of ever getting out.

22:31.113 --> 22:33.343
Unless you turn around in
this one guy's driveway, and...

22:33.449 --> 22:35.110
He didn't like that, so...

22:35.217 --> 22:36.946
It became this whole thing.

22:37.052 --> 22:38.713
You don't like my rules...

22:38.821 --> 22:40.721
George Johnson, is it?

22:42.991 --> 22:46.017
- Ooh.
- Uh-Oh.

22:46.128 --> 22:48.187
It's pronounced Jorge Juanson,

22:48.297 --> 22:50.765
And no, I don't
like your contract.

22:50.866 --> 22:52.800
And I don't like you,
either, ese.

22:52.901 --> 22:55.267
You want to take
a swing at me, kid?

22:55.371 --> 22:56.736
Then do it.

22:56.839 --> 22:58.898
Punch me.

22:59.007 --> 23:00.406
Go on.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.136
Unless you're afraid.

23:02.244 --> 23:04.542
Ooh! Oh!

23:11.286 --> 23:13.686
That it?

23:13.789 --> 23:15.313
Had enough?

23:16.825 --> 23:18.417
Here's your tooth, Coach.

23:18.527 --> 23:19.619
Thanks.

23:25.467 --> 23:27.458
Well... look who's here.

23:27.569 --> 23:30.060
She looks skinny...

23:30.172 --> 23:31.264
Fat.

23:31.373 --> 23:32.499
Her leotard's cute...

23:32.608 --> 23:33.666
Yuck.

23:33.776 --> 23:35.471
Yeah. She's pretty...

23:35.577 --> 23:36.805
Hot.

23:38.347 --> 23:39.712
I mean...

23:39.815 --> 23:41.976
I would like to smother her.

23:42.084 --> 23:43.142
Yeah.

23:43.252 --> 23:44.412
With my breasts.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.918
She never could stick it.

24:27.029 --> 24:28.997
God, she could stick me.

24:30.098 --> 24:31.861
Hi.

24:31.967 --> 24:33.457
I'm Lance.

24:33.569 --> 24:35.935
So, um, what are you, like...

24:36.038 --> 24:37.630
The laundry man?

24:37.739 --> 24:39.331
No, I just joined
the football team.

24:39.441 --> 24:41.432
Me and a few guys from
the team work here

24:41.543 --> 24:43.477
A few hours a week,
make some extra cash.

24:43.579 --> 24:44.637
That's kind of brutal.

24:44.746 --> 24:47.681
Well... it's got its perks.

24:59.228 --> 25:02.629
Anyway, um...
I was wondering,

25:02.731 --> 25:04.961
Would you like to
go out sometime?

25:06.068 --> 25:07.160
No.

25:07.269 --> 25:08.793
Why not?

25:08.904 --> 25:10.565
'Cause I'm not
looking for a man.

25:10.672 --> 25:11.798
Huh?

25:11.907 --> 25:13.169
I already have one.

25:13.275 --> 25:15.072
Oh.

25:20.415 --> 25:21.882
What's up, baby?

25:21.984 --> 25:23.849
Let's go get something to eat,

25:23.952 --> 25:25.419
'Cause a brother's starvin'.

25:25.521 --> 25:26.613
I already ate.

25:26.722 --> 25:28.121
Don't call me baby.

25:28.223 --> 25:29.986
Makes me feel like an object.

25:30.092 --> 25:31.252
I'm sorry.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.828
He was talking to me.

25:33.929 --> 25:35.487
Come on, baby.

25:37.132 --> 25:39.896
Boy got laundry to do.

25:45.007 --> 25:48.238
Some guys have all the luck.

25:49.278 --> 25:51.542
Oh, yeah.

25:52.714 --> 25:54.614
Hey, gang.

25:54.716 --> 25:56.877
Gather around-
I want to show you something.

25:58.353 --> 26:00.344
This is my old bucket

26:00.455 --> 26:03.253
From my own
college-Playing days.

26:03.358 --> 26:05.258
I was a fullback.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.453
Short-Yardage specialist

26:07.563 --> 26:09.656
For the Loserville Golden Oafers.

26:09.765 --> 26:11.824
They'd bring me in in
goal line situations mostly,

26:11.934 --> 26:13.731
You know, the Hammerhead
to punch it in.

26:13.835 --> 26:15.826
Yo, how many
touchdowns you score?

26:15.938 --> 26:16.905
Nada, zilch.

26:17.005 --> 26:18.973
Zero, not one.

26:19.074 --> 26:21.406
Boy...

26:21.510 --> 26:24.809
I'd give anything
for one last shot.

26:24.913 --> 26:26.403
Why didn't you score, Coach?

26:26.515 --> 26:28.574
Quick answer: No talent.

26:28.684 --> 26:30.117
In the big picture,

26:30.218 --> 26:32.686
We didn't play as a team.

26:32.788 --> 26:35.814
Now, there's one week
before our first game.

26:35.924 --> 26:39.223
We've got to be one body,
one heartbeat.

26:39.328 --> 26:41.159
Now, who do you play for?

26:41.263 --> 26:42.252
The Comebacks!

26:42.364 --> 26:43.626
Trotter.

26:43.732 --> 26:44.960
Who?

26:45.067 --> 26:46.034
The Comebacks!

26:46.134 --> 26:47.362
Trotter!

26:49.938 --> 26:51.735
Sorry, gang, but we are a team.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.603
If I've got to bust his hump,

26:53.709 --> 26:55.836
I've got to bust
all of your humps.

26:55.944 --> 26:56.933
- Come on, man!
- Complaining's not

26:57.045 --> 26:58.103
Gonna make a difference-

26:58.213 --> 26:59.305
It's hump-Busting time.

27:01.149 --> 27:04.482
Right! Dig! That's it!

27:04.586 --> 27:06.554
That's my team!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

27:06.655 --> 27:08.714
Ooh! Ow! Ah!

27:08.824 --> 27:10.621
Randinger!

27:10.726 --> 27:13.354
Stop goofing around!

27:13.462 --> 27:15.726
Get up here!

27:26.742 --> 27:28.767
Oh, my God.

27:30.445 --> 27:35.178
Survive on the ice,
you can survive anywhere.

27:39.621 --> 27:40.610
Yeah!

27:40.722 --> 27:43.054
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

27:44.292 --> 27:45.884
Yeah!

27:45.994 --> 27:49.623
If you can dodge a wrench,

27:49.731 --> 27:51.323
You can dodge a tackler.

27:56.905 --> 27:59.203
Same thing goes for a firearm.

28:05.681 --> 28:08.241
Did I dodge it?

28:08.350 --> 28:10.477
Walk it off.

28:13.855 --> 28:15.516
All right, listen up.

28:17.059 --> 28:19.254
No one's going home today

28:19.361 --> 28:22.592
Until one of you
can knock me down.

28:33.742 --> 28:35.972
Okay, everybody hit the showers.

28:36.078 --> 28:38.342
- Who do you play for?!
Comebacks!

28:38.447 --> 28:41.075
Trotter! Trotter!

28:42.651 --> 28:44.175
All right, good!

28:44.286 --> 28:45.947
You're finally a team!

28:49.791 --> 28:51.884
Except for you, Randy-
You'll be riding the pine.

28:51.993 --> 28:55.929
Oh, come on Coach.
I'll give you a rim job.

28:58.567 --> 29:00.558
I work down at the car wash
on the weekends.

29:00.669 --> 29:02.569
I'll have your wheels sparkling
in no time.

29:02.671 --> 29:04.730
Car wash- Right.

29:04.840 --> 29:08.241
Sometimes I think
I might have a dirty mind.

29:09.945 --> 29:12.379
First, highlights
of last night's title-Card bout

29:12.481 --> 29:14.312
Featuring a courageous
comeback attempt

29:14.416 --> 29:17.010
From the 93-Year-Old
Rocky Balboa.

29:39.541 --> 29:41.566
Hey, fellas.

29:43.211 --> 29:44.405
Name's Lambeau Fields.

29:44.513 --> 29:47.209
Just thought I'd drop by
and introduce myself.

29:47.315 --> 29:49.374
Oh, we know who you are.

29:49.484 --> 29:52.817
We know all about
you and your contract

29:52.921 --> 29:56.049
And your plans for our team.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.651
We want you
to know something,

30:00.762 --> 30:02.627
Coach.

30:02.731 --> 30:05.529
We think that's terrific! We do!

30:08.336 --> 30:10.236
But if you think
you can try using

30:10.338 --> 30:14.240
Unconventional training methods
and crazy game plans...

30:17.779 --> 30:19.838
- We support that 100 percent.
- Yeah, we do.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.176
We do.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.650
But if you should play
that first game...

30:27.756 --> 30:29.883
And lose...

30:33.261 --> 30:35.491
Aw, heck, there's always
another game after that.

30:35.597 --> 30:37.997
- There's so many games in a season!
- They play a lot!

30:40.769 --> 30:42.964
I can't tell you how relieved
that makes me feel, so...

30:43.071 --> 30:45.471
Well, good. But if you should
lose that second game,

30:45.574 --> 30:48.008
We'll tie you to a tree
and pour pig's blood

30:48.109 --> 30:50.873
All over your ass and let
the coyotes have at you.

30:58.019 --> 31:00.010
Good luck on your
first game tomorrow.

31:00.121 --> 31:02.885
- Like some coffee?
- Begging for mercy.

31:02.991 --> 31:04.515
- Oh, drink up now.
- Sure.

31:04.626 --> 31:07.390
- Oh, we brew it fresh here.
- I'd be honored if you held my gun.

31:07.495 --> 31:09.246
Oh, go ahead and
take a try with that.

31:09.247 --> 31:09.588
Yeah.

31:09.698 --> 31:12.292
- It's real good.
- Careful, it's hot.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.130
Well, I'm just-

31:15.237 --> 31:18.695
- Heh, Hey, shooter!
- Use that to stir it.

31:18.807 --> 31:20.206
You can have the whole thing-

31:20.308 --> 31:22.538
Put the weapon down.
Put the weapon down.

31:22.644 --> 31:26.376
And Coach heard
their message loud and clear.

31:26.482 --> 31:29.542
You see this was a town
that loved its football.

31:29.652 --> 31:31.916
A brisk Saturday in autumn

31:32.021 --> 31:33.784
Was like a holiday
for these folks.

31:33.890 --> 31:36.415
The whole town
shut down on game day.

31:36.525 --> 31:39.323
Everyone in Heartland,
and I mean everyone,

31:39.428 --> 31:40.895
Was at the game.

31:40.997 --> 31:42.760
MAN
Here they are,

31:42.865 --> 31:46.301
Your Heartland State
University Comebacks!

31:53.242 --> 31:54.971
Hi, honey!

31:55.077 --> 31:56.135
Good luck!

31:56.245 --> 31:58.440
What's going on?
Where is everyone?

31:58.547 --> 31:59.479
They're all two towns over

31:59.582 --> 32:00.708
At the University of Texas game.

32:00.816 --> 32:03.250
Hey, the Longhorns
just scored!

32:03.352 --> 32:06.082
And here comes the visiting team,

32:06.188 --> 32:09.351
The Boner State Trojans!

32:17.566 --> 32:19.625
These Trojans are tough.

32:19.735 --> 32:21.828
They're rock-Hard on offense!

32:21.938 --> 32:24.463
They've got a stiff defense!

32:24.573 --> 32:26.734
They'll exploit
any opening they see.

32:26.842 --> 32:31.245
And if they get in a groove,
they can score all night long,

32:31.347 --> 32:33.907
Any which way they want.

32:34.016 --> 32:38.180
You can't lay down or they
are really gonna pound us.

32:38.287 --> 32:41.051
- Season ticket holders coming through!
- Right here!

32:41.157 --> 32:42.488
12 years running!

32:42.591 --> 32:44.058
That's right!

32:44.160 --> 32:46.685
47-Yard line, bitch!

33:02.645 --> 33:05.045
All right, we can do it.

33:05.147 --> 33:08.981
ANNOUNCER
And the Heartland State University

33:09.085 --> 33:11.144
Football season is...

33:12.922 --> 33:16.756
...as bad as it was last year.

33:24.934 --> 33:26.697
Team, hut!

33:39.048 --> 33:41.380
This is so humiliating.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.620
Comebacks rule!

33:49.959 --> 33:54.123
End of the first,
Comebacks trail by 17.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.357
Here comes Trotter.

33:56.465 --> 33:58.365
Here comes Trotter.

34:00.002 --> 34:02.766
You missed the whole first quarter.
Where have you been?

34:02.872 --> 34:06.137
Get off my back, Coach.
I was doing a thing.

34:06.242 --> 34:07.800
Me.

34:07.910 --> 34:11.777
And remember, Dad, he's black.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.782
Black as a Mississippi
August night.

34:16.018 --> 34:17.542
All right, Trotter.

34:17.652 --> 34:19.621
You're on the bench
for the rest of the game.

34:19.722 --> 34:22.054
If you're ever late again,
you're off my squad.

34:22.158 --> 34:24.284
Whatever, Coach.
I'm all you got and you know it.

34:24.393 --> 34:26.293
I think you're forgetting
about someone.

34:26.395 --> 34:28.260
The future of this team.

34:28.364 --> 34:31.094
And his name is ACL Tear.

34:31.199 --> 34:34.692
Coach, you know,
I've been thinking,

34:34.804 --> 34:37.034
You might start to jinx me
if you keep calling me,

34:37.139 --> 34:38.800
Uh, that name.

34:38.908 --> 34:40.205
Nonsense.

34:40.309 --> 34:42.368
Now, get out there,
ACL, and tear it up.

34:42.478 --> 34:43.638
Tear it up good.

34:43.746 --> 34:44.940
All right, Coach.

34:45.047 --> 34:45.842
Go get 'em, Tear.

34:45.947 --> 34:47.074
Let's go, Comebacks-

34:47.183 --> 34:48.946
Execution, execution.

34:51.687 --> 34:54.417
Green 80!

34:54.523 --> 34:56.581
Green 80! Set. Hut.

34:57.993 --> 35:00.188
Go.

35:00.296 --> 35:01.923
Go!

35:03.299 --> 35:04.596
Ooh!

35:25.387 --> 35:27.855
Nothing can stop him!
Nothing can stop this kid!

35:46.041 --> 35:48.566
'At a way, ACL Tear-
Shake it off.

35:48.677 --> 35:50.872
- Way to take a hit from a bus, dude.
- That's right.

36:13.335 --> 36:16.168
Final score: Trojans 83,

36:16.272 --> 36:18.672
Comebacks 0.

36:24.914 --> 36:26.313
Hold this.

36:26.415 --> 36:29.179
What did I tell you about
dropping the ball?

36:29.285 --> 36:31.185
Dad, I only fumbled
a couple of times.

36:31.287 --> 36:32.481
A couple!

36:32.588 --> 36:34.317
Why don't you tell
Maddonald here just exactly

36:34.423 --> 36:35.822
How many times
you fumbled?

36:35.925 --> 36:36.648
Two.

36:36.725 --> 36:38.750
Two! Two times!

36:38.861 --> 36:40.590
Is that what you call "a couple"?

36:40.696 --> 36:42.755
Actually, Dad, two is a couple.

36:42.865 --> 36:45.026
This conversation is over!

36:45.134 --> 36:48.365
Come on. Loser!

36:48.470 --> 36:50.370
You can kiss my ass.

36:58.180 --> 37:00.705
Coach?

37:03.686 --> 37:06.382
You have been sitting
in here for hours.

37:06.488 --> 37:10.515
I've just got a few more
films to go through.

37:10.626 --> 37:13.424
Can't you watch them tomorrow?

37:13.529 --> 37:15.326
Not if I want my
team to be ready

37:15.431 --> 37:16.921
To play the
Titans next week.

37:19.768 --> 37:21.929
It's starting again, Coach.

37:22.037 --> 37:23.026
Hmm?

37:23.138 --> 37:25.902
You're ignoring me, this family.

37:26.008 --> 37:27.100
I am not.

37:27.209 --> 37:28.506
Oh, please!

37:28.611 --> 37:31.307
You have sat in here night after night,
forgetting about me

37:31.413 --> 37:33.881
And everything
that matters to you.

37:33.983 --> 37:37.111
Ignoring us is-Is something
that you've never been able to resist,

37:37.219 --> 37:40.916
Like a make-Your-Own-Taco bar
or midget wrestling.

37:41.023 --> 37:42.320
Jesus, Barb.

37:42.424 --> 37:44.756
This is my last shot.

37:44.860 --> 37:46.452
These films matter.

37:46.562 --> 37:49.588
I need them to become
a better coach, to win.

37:49.698 --> 37:51.666
I just don't see how watching

37:51.767 --> 37:54.497
Man-On-Man porn
makes you a better coach.

37:54.603 --> 37:57.094
Why must everyone
question my method?

37:57.206 --> 38:00.232
Why does it have to be so hard core?

38:00.342 --> 38:03.277
Once again, my method!

38:03.379 --> 38:05.176
Can you knock it off, I Pod?

38:05.281 --> 38:06.543
It's a DVD, for God's sakes.

38:27.770 --> 38:29.533
It's open.

38:34.043 --> 38:35.203
Hey, um...

38:35.311 --> 38:37.006
Hi.

38:37.112 --> 38:38.841
- I was just, um...
- I get it.

38:38.947 --> 38:42.178
Practicing ballet will help
with your footwork in the pocket?

38:42.284 --> 38:43.546
Exactly.

38:43.652 --> 38:46.553
It's the footwork in the pocket.

38:46.655 --> 38:48.316
Um...

38:48.424 --> 38:49.948
Yeah, what's up?

38:50.059 --> 38:51.720
I'm supposed to give you these.

38:51.827 --> 38:53.920
Oh, okay.

38:54.029 --> 38:57.328
The Gridiron Gangbang.

38:57.433 --> 38:59.833
The Bad News Bare Asses.

38:59.935 --> 39:01.493
The Longest Nards.

39:03.806 --> 39:05.774
- His method.
- His method. Yeah.

39:05.874 --> 39:07.637
What's that all about?

39:07.743 --> 39:10.075
What? Oh, this?

39:10.179 --> 39:11.612
My dad thought
it might help me

39:11.714 --> 39:13.614
Hold onto the ball
for next game.

39:13.716 --> 39:16.776
Does it hurt?

39:16.885 --> 39:19.217
I'm kind of used to it.

39:19.321 --> 39:22.688
So he's done this before?

39:22.791 --> 39:25.021
Yeah.

39:29.765 --> 39:31.596
Yeah.

39:33.202 --> 39:35.602
There, that'll keep
you from letting go.

39:38.073 --> 39:42.476
Hey, look out for the tr-

39:42.578 --> 39:43.649
Don't worry about it.

39:43.650 --> 39:45.945
They're baby teeth.
You'll grow new ones.

39:46.048 --> 39:48.983
Happy 12th birthday, Lance.

39:49.084 --> 39:51.211
There you go. Drink up.

39:56.091 --> 39:58.525
Let's get out of here.
Let's go to a bar or something.

40:17.112 --> 40:19.603
The thing is, it's all my fault.

40:19.715 --> 40:22.742
I got a great arm,
but I keep dropping the ball.

40:22.852 --> 40:24.683
I always have.

40:24.788 --> 40:26.756
I mean, I don't know how to fix it.

40:26.856 --> 40:29.051
See?

40:29.159 --> 40:30.751
You have no idea
what it's like

40:30.860 --> 40:33.124
To have a father whose
entire world is sports.

40:33.229 --> 40:36.289
Oh, you think so?

40:38.902 --> 40:42.599
Mom, go long. Go long.

40:43.873 --> 40:46.637
- Close your eyes
- Right?

40:46.743 --> 40:49.473
Don't want you to see...

40:49.579 --> 40:52.412
That's my girl,
straight A's!

40:52.515 --> 40:53.948
Straight A's!

40:54.050 --> 40:56.314
Let's just say it

41:01.458 --> 41:03.892
Where are we going?

41:03.993 --> 41:06.427
Illegal use
of the hands.

41:06.529 --> 41:09.498
- Have we gone too far?
- Game over.

41:09.599 --> 41:13.035
Have we gone too far?

41:13.136 --> 41:14.899
Wow.

41:15.004 --> 41:16.266
I had no idea.

41:16.372 --> 41:19.034
Have we gone too far?

41:19.142 --> 41:22.475
I thought that I had the
craziest sports dad ever.

41:22.579 --> 41:24.046
Me, too.

41:24.147 --> 41:26.672
Just close your eyes

41:26.783 --> 41:28.250
What a surprise

41:28.351 --> 41:29.613
Till we get there

41:29.719 --> 41:32.813
You won't know where

41:32.922 --> 41:34.253
See you around

41:34.357 --> 41:36.257
I hope I see you around

41:36.359 --> 41:37.656
Just close your eyes

41:37.760 --> 41:39.250
The way I always do

41:39.362 --> 41:42.923
It's always a surprise

41:43.032 --> 41:44.499
To be with you

41:44.601 --> 41:47.764
You won't know where...

41:47.871 --> 41:49.361
Wow.

41:49.472 --> 41:52.168
They look just like footballs.

41:58.448 --> 41:59.472
Oh.

42:06.723 --> 42:08.748
Oh.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.289
No, wait.

42:12.395 --> 42:13.760
- I, I can't do this.
- No.

42:13.863 --> 42:14.955
Yeah, it's okay,
I can hold onto them.

42:15.064 --> 42:16.156
- No, really, I...
- No, just give me a chance.

42:16.266 --> 42:17.358
It's all wrong.

42:17.467 --> 42:18.456
I have a boyfriend.

42:18.568 --> 42:20.195
- Yeah, I know.
- So I have to... go.

42:20.303 --> 42:22.294
No! I...

42:22.405 --> 42:25.670
Um, Michelle, I... I need
to tell you something.

42:25.775 --> 42:27.504
Michelle.

42:37.320 --> 42:38.981
Out of my way, fat ass.

42:39.088 --> 42:42.057
You finally decide to block
something and it's my locker?

42:42.158 --> 42:44.058
I was just going to
drop off an invitation

42:44.160 --> 42:46.287
To my birthday party.

42:46.396 --> 42:49.263
FYI, there's going
to be a petting zoo.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.124
Nice.

42:52.235 --> 42:53.998
Score one for Trotter,

42:54.103 --> 42:56.196
Which is one more
than he had yesterday.

42:56.306 --> 42:57.739
Ooh...

42:57.840 --> 42:59.831
Look, man, why don't you just
pretend this whole thing

42:59.943 --> 43:01.877
Is a football...
and just drop it?

43:01.978 --> 43:04.742
PLAYERS
Ooh!

43:04.847 --> 43:07.145
Why don't you act like a barbell
and get benched?

43:09.919 --> 43:12.217
Why don't you pretend this
whole thing is a basket

43:12.322 --> 43:14.119
Full of groceries
and get sacked?

43:16.125 --> 43:17.854
Hey, hey!

43:17.961 --> 43:19.895
Why don't you act like my parents,

43:19.996 --> 43:22.863
Go upstairs
and have some makeup sex?

43:22.966 --> 43:24.593
- Huh?
- What?

43:45.321 --> 43:47.118
Hey!

43:48.524 --> 43:51.425
Knock it off!
Knock it off!

43:51.527 --> 43:53.358
Yeah.

43:54.430 --> 43:56.330
Now, you listen to me.

43:56.432 --> 43:58.024
This is a team.

43:58.134 --> 44:00.864
And the only way
we're going to win

44:00.970 --> 44:03.234
Is when you start
acting like one.

44:03.339 --> 44:06.001
And you can sure as hell bet
that no one is leaving

44:06.109 --> 44:08.771
This locker room
until you understand

44:08.878 --> 44:12.974
What being a team is all about.

44:18.021 --> 44:20.546
Coach is right.

44:20.657 --> 44:23.217
We got to start believing
in each other.

44:23.326 --> 44:25.055
Like brothers.

44:25.161 --> 44:27.561
That's the only way
we're going to win.

44:27.664 --> 44:29.222
Please.

44:29.332 --> 44:32.267
You'll never be my brother.

44:33.703 --> 44:36.866
Si, es la verdad.

44:36.973 --> 44:39.339
We're all too different.

44:39.442 --> 44:42.206
Nothing in this world could
bring this team together.

44:55.024 --> 44:58.516
#Just a small-Town girl #

44:58.628 --> 45:03.224
#Living in a lonely world#

45:03.332 --> 45:09.396
#She took a midnight
train going anywhere#

45:11.474 --> 45:15.171
#Just a city boy#

45:15.278 --> 45:19.908
#Born and raised
in South Detroit#

45:20.016 --> 45:25.921
#He took the midnight train
going anywhere!#

45:27.557 --> 45:31.357
#A singer in a smoky room#

45:31.461 --> 45:35.090
#The smell of wine
and cheap perfume#

45:35.198 --> 45:37.894
#For a smile,
they can share the night#

45:38.000 --> 45:42.801
#It goes on and on
and on and on#

45:42.905 --> 45:47.604
#Strangers waiting#

45:47.710 --> 45:51.339
#Up and down the boulevard#

45:51.447 --> 45:57.386
#Their shadows searching
in the night#

45:58.755 --> 46:04.022
#Streetlight people#

46:04.127 --> 46:06.994
#Livin' just to find emotion#

46:07.096 --> 46:08.654
#Hiding#

46:08.765 --> 46:14.499
#Somewhere in the night#

46:23.279 --> 46:27.272
#Strangers waiting#

46:27.383 --> 46:30.682
#Up and down the boulevard#

46:30.787 --> 46:34.314
#Their shadows searching#

46:34.423 --> 46:39.759
#In the night#

46:39.862 --> 46:44.231
#Don't stop believin' #

46:44.333 --> 46:47.325
#Hold on to that feeling#

46:47.436 --> 46:55.366
#Streetlight people #

46:55.478 --> 46:59.938
#Don't stop believin' #

47:00.049 --> 47:03.485
# Hold on #

47:03.586 --> 47:05.611
#Streetlight... #

47:05.721 --> 47:08.246
And the booster club
laughed at me when I demanded

47:08.357 --> 47:11.053
A smoke machine and laser lights
for the locker room.

47:14.964 --> 47:17.558
All right, gather 'round, take a knee.

47:17.667 --> 47:21.728
Got a letter here from
a little boy named Bobby Taylor.

47:21.838 --> 47:25.604
The kid's sick, real sick.

47:25.708 --> 47:30.111
Probably won't make it
through the night.

47:30.213 --> 47:32.841
Goddamn it.

47:32.949 --> 47:36.282
Bobby has one last dying wish.

47:36.385 --> 47:39.912
That's for the opposing team
to win this game.

47:40.022 --> 47:41.956
Now, we gonna let Bobby
get his wish?

47:42.058 --> 47:43.423
No!

47:43.526 --> 47:45.756
- What do we want him to do?
Die sad!

47:45.862 --> 47:47.921
- Can't hear you.
- Die sad!

47:48.030 --> 47:50.624
Get out there...

48:11.754 --> 48:13.312
- Let's go, Comebacks.
- Yeah, Comebacks.

48:13.422 --> 48:14.980
- Who are they playing?
- Uh, I don't know, the Titans?

48:15.091 --> 48:16.388
Do you remember them?

48:16.492 --> 48:17.532
No, I don't, 'cause
they're forgettable.

48:17.533 --> 48:18.016
Very forgettable.

48:18.127 --> 48:20.095
Okay, listen up.

48:20.196 --> 48:22.426
Since our team got integrated,

48:22.531 --> 48:24.863
I know a lot of you white
players are nervous

48:24.967 --> 48:27.800
About losing your positions
to our faster,

48:27.904 --> 48:31.237
More athletic,
more talented colored boys.

48:31.340 --> 48:33.035
Well, you have nothing
to worry about,

48:33.142 --> 48:34.837
'Cause when the Titans
take the field,

48:34.944 --> 48:37.970
There is no black and white...
just crimson and gold,

48:38.080 --> 48:39.911
- The colors of our uniform.
- Yes.

48:40.016 --> 48:41.677
We family.

48:41.784 --> 48:44.309
Starting lineup, Isaiah.

48:44.420 --> 48:46.183
Come on.

48:46.289 --> 48:48.257
- Williams.
- Yeah.

48:48.357 --> 48:50.382
- Washington.
- Yeah.

48:50.493 --> 48:53.189
Washington.

48:53.296 --> 48:55.890
- Washington.
- Yes.

48:55.998 --> 48:57.226
Damn. Washington.

48:57.333 --> 48:58.527
Yeah.

48:58.634 --> 49:00.067
- Jefferson.
- Come on, Jefferson.

49:00.169 --> 49:02.069
Jefferson, tell your mom
I got caller I D now.

49:02.171 --> 49:03.729
I know it's her.

49:03.839 --> 49:05.033
- Carter.
- Come on, Carter.

49:05.174 --> 49:07.438
Check his eligibility.

49:07.543 --> 49:09.067
- Boyer.
- Yeah.

49:09.178 --> 49:11.078
- LeTroy.
- Yeah! Let's do this!

49:11.180 --> 49:13.375
Where the hell you
think you're going?

49:13.482 --> 49:14.608
You said Troy.

49:14.717 --> 49:16.184
I said LeTroy.

49:16.285 --> 49:18.254
Sit your marshmallow
ass back on the bench.

49:19.356 --> 49:21.722
White boy think he gonna
cover a receiver.

49:21.825 --> 49:23.690
You gonna learn,

49:23.794 --> 49:25.523
Crack is whack
and white don't cover black!

49:25.629 --> 49:27.859
Now let's pray.

49:27.965 --> 49:29.865
Red and white.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.696
That's right, that's right,
that's right, that's right.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.201
Red and white.

49:33.303 --> 49:34.395
Here's the kickoff,

49:34.504 --> 49:37.029
As the Comebacks
try to bounce back

49:37.140 --> 49:40.132
From last week's
humiliating loss.

49:43.847 --> 49:46.975
The ball is loose...
and Trotter recovers!

49:47.084 --> 49:48.813
Yes! Yes!

49:48.919 --> 49:51.444
- That's the way!
- Yeah, yeah! Yeah, baby.

49:51.555 --> 49:52.886
That's the way right there.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.890
Ready, break!

50:00.664 --> 50:02.393
Hmm?

50:02.499 --> 50:03.932
Mm-Hmm.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.196
Hike!

50:06.303 --> 50:08.271
Truman drops back.

50:08.372 --> 50:11.364
Touchdown Comebacks.

50:12.809 --> 50:16.040
Their first score of the season.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.704
Hike!

50:22.819 --> 50:25.379
Juanson picks up the loose ball.

50:26.556 --> 50:29.548
- Touchdown!
- Whoo!

50:29.659 --> 50:31.092
That's how we do it.

50:31.194 --> 50:32.252
All right!

50:32.362 --> 50:35.456
Sorry. I hugged him
a little too hard.

50:35.565 --> 50:37.328
I like your badonkadonks,
by the way.

50:42.939 --> 50:44.406
Let's go!

50:44.508 --> 50:46.738
Set. Hut!

50:46.843 --> 50:49.311
Titans on the reverse.

50:50.814 --> 50:52.213
Ooh, what a move!

50:52.315 --> 50:55.751
He's to the 30, the 20, the 10!

50:55.852 --> 50:58.116
Another Titans touchdown.

50:58.221 --> 50:59.950
Are you kidding me?

51:05.896 --> 51:09.457
Let's go get the quarterback!
Let's go!

51:16.606 --> 51:18.267
Yeah, I get it.
You're gonna kill me.

51:20.377 --> 51:21.901
Wha-What's this part?

51:22.012 --> 51:24.003
Oh, that means
he's gonna fist you too.

51:24.114 --> 51:26.309
Time's ticking down,
and we're still tied.

51:26.416 --> 51:29.817
It all rests in the hands
of quarterback Lance Truman.

51:29.920 --> 51:30.852
Blue 20.

51:30.954 --> 51:33.946
Blue 20. Hut!

51:37.561 --> 51:39.028
He drops back.

51:42.933 --> 51:45.197
They're going long!

51:48.271 --> 51:50.262
Juanson's wide open.

51:50.373 --> 51:52.398
- He makes the catch.
- That's the way!

51:52.509 --> 51:55.069
Hot damn, he's on fire.

52:00.016 --> 52:02.678
Touchdown! The Comebacks win!

52:02.786 --> 52:05.084
The Comebacks win!

52:05.188 --> 52:06.678
Whoo-Hah!

52:22.939 --> 52:25.874
Oh, gee.
Oh, di, do, do, di, do.

52:27.043 --> 52:29.534
Whoo, you like that,
you big baby, don't you?

52:29.646 --> 52:31.910
- Take it like a man.
- All right!

52:32.015 --> 52:34.677
Heck of a job
out there today!

52:36.253 --> 52:39.017
- Except for Randy.
Aww...

52:39.122 --> 52:41.590
You had no part in the victory.
You added nothing.

52:41.691 --> 52:45.149
Coach, can I play
in the next game?

52:46.463 --> 52:48.363
I'll toss your salad.

52:48.465 --> 52:51.195
Please tell me you're gonna start
chopping up lettuce and tomatoes.

52:51.301 --> 52:52.666
I'll salute your flagpole.

52:52.769 --> 52:54.828
Please tell me
you're a patriot.

52:54.938 --> 52:57.566
I'll pack your fudge.

52:57.674 --> 53:00.768
Please tell me you're
a confectioner's assistant.

53:00.877 --> 53:04.404
Oh, no. I really meant I was gonna
pack your fudge and toss your salad.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.712
All right, listen.

53:08.818 --> 53:11.116
I want you all
to go out and celebrate.

53:11.221 --> 53:14.315
Tear it up.
Explore your bodies.

53:14.424 --> 53:19.020
Lather up your nethers,
get 'em wet, sticky. Shave it.

53:19.129 --> 53:21.393
Go out and get yourself
a venereal disease,

53:21.498 --> 53:23.193
Whatever it is you kids
are into these days.

53:23.300 --> 53:25.734
All right, get in here.
S.T.D.'S on three.

53:27.837 --> 53:30.203
- One, two, three.
- S.T.D.'S.

53:44.254 --> 53:46.119
The strippers are here.
