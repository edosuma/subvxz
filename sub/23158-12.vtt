WEBVTT

00:00.077 --> 00:02.417
He used to be a strategist
for British Intelligence.

00:02.442 --> 00:03.909
I want to talk to him
one on one.

00:03.977 --> 00:05.638
Who else is looking for him?

00:09.082 --> 00:11.812
If I catch your face around here again,
I'm gonna get real nasty.

00:11.884 --> 00:13.852
He's selling himself
to the highest bidder.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.149
<i>He's an international</i>
<i>assassin. A killer.</i>

00:16.222 --> 00:18.690
He has to come back to arm it,
that's when we nail him.

00:18.758 --> 00:20.089
I want in on the kill.

00:20.159 --> 00:21.456
What were you gonna do, Kate?

00:21.527 --> 00:22.892
Film the assassination?

00:28.201 --> 00:29.498
Hold it!

02:20.213 --> 02:23.512
<i>Sister, I'm sorry</i>
<i>but you cannot stop here.</i>

02:23.583 --> 02:24.982
<i>But my car.</i>

02:26.919 --> 02:29.353
<i>You'll have</i>
<i>to move it.</i>

02:29.422 --> 02:30.946
<i>But I can't.</i>

02:33.960 --> 02:35.154
<i>Do you have a spare?</i>

02:35.228 --> 02:36.627
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

02:46.606 --> 02:48.938
<i>This is very kind of you.</i>
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

02:50.910 --> 02:52.844
<i>Will it take long?</i>

02:52.912 --> 02:54.607
<i>I hope not.</i>

02:55.014 --> 02:57.710
<i>Do you mind?</i>
<i>I have to go to the store.</i>

02:57.783 --> 03:00.274
<i>Not at all.</i>
<i>Just hurry back.</i>

03:00.853 --> 03:03.651
<i>I'll only be a minute.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

04:41.354 --> 04:44.050
<i>I don't need to tell you</i>
<i>that Robin Masters appreciates</i>

04:44.123 --> 04:45.750
<i>the finer things in life.</i>

04:45.825 --> 04:48.885
<i>A good example of Robin's</i>
<i>taste is his wine cellar.</i>

04:48.961 --> 04:50.394
<i>He'd offered me</i>
<i>the use of it,</i>

04:50.463 --> 04:52.260
<i>and I tried not to abuse</i>
<i>the privilege.</i>

04:52.331 --> 04:54.322
<i>A bottle here</i>
<i>and a bottle there.</i>

04:54.400 --> 04:56.595
<i>Hardly enough to be noticed.</i>

04:58.037 --> 05:02.064
<i>Sometimes Higgins' attempts at</i>
<i>security are really quite amusing.</i>

05:33.939 --> 05:35.668
Identify yourself.

05:38.577 --> 05:41.444
You leave me no choice
but to release the nerve gas.

05:41.514 --> 05:43.243
<i>Nerve gas?</i>

05:45.117 --> 05:46.607
I thought so.

05:48.321 --> 05:49.652
Nerve gas?

05:49.722 --> 05:51.485
Tear gas, actually.

05:51.557 --> 05:53.491
I didn't think
you'd react to that.

05:53.559 --> 05:55.026
The bottle, please.

06:06.472 --> 06:08.872
Higgins,
what is going on here?

06:08.941 --> 06:11.501
You have the temerity
to ask me that?

06:11.744 --> 06:13.143
You're pilfering wine.

06:13.212 --> 06:14.440
I wasn't pilfering.

06:14.513 --> 06:17.778
And even if I was, Higgins, you've never
threatened me with tear gas before.

06:17.850 --> 06:21.342
You never went for a $5,000
bottle of wine before.

06:21.554 --> 06:23.146
$5,000?

06:23.723 --> 06:25.691
And a bargain at that.

06:26.292 --> 06:29.193
A bottle of
Chateau de Maurice. 1836.

06:29.562 --> 06:31.154
The highlight
of the <i>Societe du Vin's</i>

06:31.230 --> 06:33.255
gala wine-tasting party
next week.

06:33.332 --> 06:37.132
Now, of course,
you've moved it and made it bottle sick.

06:37.703 --> 06:39.170
Bottle sick?

06:39.238 --> 06:40.865
Society du Vin?

06:40.940 --> 06:43.670
Oh, Higgins,
what do you do in this one?

06:43.743 --> 06:45.608
I'm the head
of the acquisition committee.

06:45.678 --> 06:47.669
And I won't have you
swilling my acquisitions.

06:47.747 --> 06:49.374
All you had to do was ask.

06:49.448 --> 06:50.540
I intended to,

06:50.616 --> 06:54.108
but I thought it prudent to
first prepare an incentive.

06:54.754 --> 06:56.984
I put together
a potpourri of wines

06:57.056 --> 07:01.186
which I hope will keep you out of the
wine cellar until after the party.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.387
Higgins, that's
very thoughtful of you.

07:03.462 --> 07:04.861
Yes, isn't it?

07:05.498 --> 07:08.524
Oh, by the way,
you had a call this morning.

07:09.435 --> 07:13.132
I don't know how people get the main
house number. It isn't even listed.

07:13.205 --> 07:14.229
Who was it, Higgins?

07:14.306 --> 07:15.739
A woman.
A Kate Sullivan.

07:15.808 --> 07:17.435
She said she'd meet you at the club.

07:17.510 --> 07:20.411
Now, here's white,
that's for fowl.

07:21.013 --> 07:24.244
The red, of course,
is for meat of the same color.

07:24.550 --> 07:25.949
Though I've gone
out of my way,

07:26.018 --> 07:27.645
you really needn't
thank me for this.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.312
Let's just consider it...

07:32.358 --> 07:33.985
One hand washing the other.

07:36.529 --> 07:38.520
<i>Kate had been</i>
<i>a wire-service reporter</i>

07:38.597 --> 07:41.828
<i>working out of Saigon when she</i>
<i>came to do a story on our team.</i>

07:41.901 --> 07:43.061
<i>She was an idealist.</i>

07:43.135 --> 07:45.695
<i>Not naive,</i>
<i>but still an idealist.</i>

07:45.771 --> 07:47.796
<i>She wanted to write the truth.</i>

07:47.873 --> 07:50.967
<i>And if the truth happened to</i>
<i>be located in a free-fire zone,</i>

07:51.043 --> 07:54.672
<i>or if the truth wasn't exactly what</i>
<i>she thought it would be going in,</i>

07:54.747 --> 07:56.339
<i>well, she'd write it anyway.</i>

07:56.415 --> 07:58.781
<i>That's the Kate</i>
<i>we all fell for.</i>

07:58.951 --> 08:02.114
<i>And when she got wounded,</i>
<i>it was a buddy getting hit.</i>

08:02.188 --> 08:05.715
Yeah, I ain't gonna never forgive
her for that one line. Uh...

08:05.791 --> 08:07.418
What did you say?

08:07.493 --> 08:10.189
Yeah, yeah.
"Grizzled veteran at 25."

08:11.764 --> 08:13.857
Yeah, but I'm the one
with the axe to grind.

08:13.933 --> 08:16.094
She called me "baby-faced."
Now, do I look baby-faced?

08:17.269 --> 08:18.998
You both look beautiful.

08:19.071 --> 08:21.767
Another gross distortion
of the truth.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.643
Hey. Hey.

08:26.979 --> 08:28.378
Come here.

08:28.614 --> 08:29.706
How you doing?

08:31.450 --> 08:33.280
Better now. Oh, gee.

08:33.352 --> 08:35.217
Well, I see
nothing's changed.

08:35.287 --> 08:36.549
Almost nothing.

08:36.621 --> 08:37.714
Sit, sit.

08:37.789 --> 08:38.847
Uh, yeah.

08:38.924 --> 08:40.982
Want a beer?
Sure.

08:41.494 --> 08:44.054
Well, what brings you
to Hawaii?

08:44.129 --> 08:45.687
You doing a follow-up on us?

08:45.764 --> 08:47.891
Oh, I wish.
It'd be more interesting.

08:47.967 --> 08:50.094
No, I'm here
on this month's milk run.

08:50.169 --> 08:52.569
Did you ever hear
of the Jororo Islands?

08:52.638 --> 08:54.606
Somewhere near Guam?

08:54.673 --> 08:55.901
Right ocean. Wrong hemisphere.

08:55.975 --> 08:58.500
It's about 1,200 miles
southeast of Guam.

08:58.577 --> 09:02.104
And Oscar Santos, who is their prime
minister, is here on a state visit.

09:02.181 --> 09:04.615
Gee, I hadn't heard about it.
That's how big a story it is.

09:05.818 --> 09:06.842
Well,
that's great.

09:06.919 --> 09:08.546
You'll get to spend
some time with us.

09:08.621 --> 09:10.145
And I want to take you
to dinner.

09:10.222 --> 09:14.158
I got this little place that nobody
knows about except me and Julia Child.

09:14.226 --> 09:18.356
Oh, yeah, and I can give you the Island
Hoppers grand tour of the islands.

09:18.430 --> 09:20.193
You're on, both of you.

09:20.266 --> 09:21.756
But first, I have
a favor to ask.

09:21.834 --> 09:23.131
Just name it.

09:23.202 --> 09:27.070
I would like to take a walk on
the beach with this man. Alone.

09:27.206 --> 09:28.332
What?

09:28.407 --> 09:29.772
Oh!

09:29.842 --> 09:32.106
Don't worry, Thomas.
It's strictly business.

09:32.177 --> 09:33.235
I knew it.

09:33.312 --> 09:34.904
What do you mean
you knew it?

09:34.980 --> 09:38.939
Man, a woman as together as Kate
wouldn't fall for a turkey like you.

09:40.185 --> 09:41.516
How do I win
on that one?

09:41.587 --> 09:43.077
You don't.
Come on.

09:43.522 --> 09:44.819
Guard my purse, huh?

09:44.890 --> 09:46.221
Ok.
Bye, guys.

09:46.292 --> 09:47.452
Bye.

09:58.037 --> 09:59.732
Business?
Mmm-hmm.

10:00.806 --> 10:03.866
This Santos story is lightweight stuff,
you know.

10:03.943 --> 10:07.140
But it's about the only kind
of work I get these days.

10:07.212 --> 10:08.804
I don't mind
covering the 3rd Worid

10:08.881 --> 10:10.348
as long as there's
a war going on.

10:10.416 --> 10:12.816
Well, it could be worse.
You got a trip to Hawaii out of it.

10:12.885 --> 10:15.115
I'm not looking
for vacations.

10:15.187 --> 10:17.018
Thomas, you know me.

10:17.089 --> 10:18.454
I was weaned on action.

10:18.524 --> 10:20.992
I used to go everywhere
and anywhere for the story.

10:21.060 --> 10:23.585
If the story was important enough,
nothing could stop me.

10:23.662 --> 10:25.220
Not editors
or generals

10:25.664 --> 10:26.995
or V.C.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.895
Navy lieutenants.

10:31.103 --> 10:32.627
And I'm good.

10:33.105 --> 10:35.938
But people look at me and they
don't want to believe that.

10:36.008 --> 10:38.704
So the kind of assignments
I get are...

10:40.546 --> 10:42.343
I want back on top.

10:43.248 --> 10:46.308
Well, I'd like to see you there.
What can I do?

10:46.919 --> 10:48.750
Well, I wouldn't have
taken this dumb gig

10:48.821 --> 10:50.015
If I didn't have

10:50.189 --> 10:52.885
an ulterior motive.
Like a real story.

10:53.425 --> 10:55.450
That face
ring any bells?

10:57.329 --> 10:58.626
No bells.

10:59.098 --> 11:00.190
David Banister.

11:00.265 --> 11:02.631
He used to be a strategist
for British Intelligence.

11:02.701 --> 11:03.861
Ml6.

11:04.169 --> 11:06.194
Then he dropped out
to write an expose.

11:06.271 --> 11:08.671
You know,
uncover all that covert nasty stuff.

11:08.741 --> 11:11.574
I got a tip he's coming
into the islands, and, uh,

11:12.011 --> 11:13.774
I want to talk to him
one on one.

11:13.846 --> 11:15.677
Still out for
the Pulitzer Prize?

11:15.748 --> 11:17.113
You bet.

11:18.617 --> 11:20.482
Why don't you talk
to his publisher?

11:20.552 --> 11:23.783
Come on, Thomas. You know better
than that. They wouldn't even tell me

11:23.856 --> 11:26.188
what continent he was on.
Kate.

11:26.692 --> 11:28.853
Who else is looking for him?

11:30.262 --> 11:32.355
Rumor has it,
British Intelligence.

11:32.431 --> 11:33.989
Some say there's a price on his head.

11:34.066 --> 11:35.795
Of course,
most people don't believe it.

11:35.868 --> 11:37.426
What about Banister?

11:37.503 --> 11:38.731
He just might.

11:38.804 --> 11:39.793
Kate...
Thomas,

11:39.872 --> 11:42.466
I don't want you getting hurt or
in the middle. Just locate him.

11:42.541 --> 11:43.940
That's not
what I'm talking about.

11:44.009 --> 11:46.443
Don't worry.
I can handle myself.

11:46.945 --> 11:50.278
If anybody in the worid knows that,
it should be you.

11:56.455 --> 11:57.854
<i>Please remain seated</i>

11:57.923 --> 11:59.584
<i>until the aircraft</i>
<i>is in the terminal.</i>

11:59.658 --> 12:00.955
<i>Upon deplaning,</i>

12:01.026 --> 12:04.018
<i>all passengers will have to take</i>
<i>the Wiki Wiki buses to Customs.</i>

12:04.096 --> 12:08.624
<i>Have your passports and any items to</i>
<i>declare ready for inspection, please.</i>

12:12.071 --> 12:15.905
<i>Trans Island Airlines</i>
<i>Flight 291 to Guam</i>

12:16.041 --> 12:18.908
<i>now ready for boarding</i>
<i>at Gate 15.</i>

12:19.078 --> 12:23.071
<i>Flight 291 to Guam</i>
<i>now boarding at Gate 15.</i>

12:23.449 --> 12:24.643
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:24.717 --> 12:26.048
Anything to declare?

12:26.118 --> 12:27.949
Nothing.
Just in on a holiday.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.180
Have a good one, love.

12:29.254 --> 12:31.518
Thanks, love.
I intend to.

12:50.107 --> 12:51.734
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

12:51.809 --> 12:53.834
<i>I was swimming when I</i>
<i>should have been working.</i>

12:53.911 --> 12:57.244
<i>Well, you've neglected an</i>
<i>important rule of investigation:</i>

12:57.315 --> 12:59.510
<i>Don't take things</i>
<i>at face value.</i>

12:59.583 --> 13:03.917
<i>Though I may have appeared to be</i>
<i>loafing, serious work was in progress.</i>

13:04.588 --> 13:06.954
This is great. Just great.

13:07.024 --> 13:08.889
I'm really flattered
you asked me.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.690
Come on, Mac, we don't get
to see enough of each other.

13:11.762 --> 13:14.060
Hey, l... I hope you don't mind
that we didn't go out.

13:14.131 --> 13:16.998
I mean, I get out there in anything
smaller than an aircraft carrier,

13:17.068 --> 13:18.057
l... I start to...

13:18.135 --> 13:19.727
Forget it.
Let me tell you something.

13:19.804 --> 13:22.272
The best fishing on this island
is right here at this marina.

13:22.340 --> 13:23.932
I'm just glad
we're getting to do it.

13:24.008 --> 13:25.498
You're right.
You're very right.

13:25.576 --> 13:27.806
You know, I think we ought
to do this on a regular basis.

13:27.878 --> 13:31.370
I know. It's just hard for me to find
the time, with running the club and all

13:31.449 --> 13:32.848
and answering to Higgins,
Yeah.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.112
And doing all of those
dumb things for Thomas.

13:35.186 --> 13:38.349
Oh, no, oh, no, don't even bring
up that name to me, please.

13:38.422 --> 13:40.390
Never in my life
have I met a man

13:40.458 --> 13:43.359
that takes more advantage of
his friends than Thomas Magnum.

13:43.427 --> 13:46.396
You know that? I mean it,
he comes to me, he says:

13:46.464 --> 13:48.489
"Oh, come on, Mac,
run this through your computers.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.296
Just this one time. You won't get
into trouble. Come on. Please."

13:51.369 --> 13:54.270
Then he gets... he says,
"Have a sandwich. Have a donut." Huh!

13:54.338 --> 13:57.671
Can you believe it,
this guy is bribing me with food?

13:59.110 --> 14:01.544
He's so transparent,
I can't stand it.

14:01.612 --> 14:03.637
Well, I'll tell you what,
I put an end to that.

14:03.714 --> 14:04.806
Put my foot down.

14:04.882 --> 14:05.940
No kidding?

14:06.017 --> 14:08.850
Yeah. He won't come
running to me anymore.

14:09.387 --> 14:11.514
Say, Rick, uh,
you got beer?

14:12.056 --> 14:14.024
Oh, yeah, Mac,
right here in this chest.

14:14.091 --> 14:15.820
Oh, thanks.

14:15.893 --> 14:17.554
You know, Mac,
you're right.

14:17.628 --> 14:19.289
Thomas does
the same thing to me.

14:19.363 --> 14:20.921
"Rick,
run this license down.

14:20.998 --> 14:22.363
"Rick,
check this guy out.

14:22.433 --> 14:24.367
Rick, get the skinny
on so-and-so."

14:24.435 --> 14:27.734
Yeah, well, maybe you ought
to put a stop to it, too.

14:27.805 --> 14:29.636
Say, uh, you got anything
to go with this?

14:29.707 --> 14:32.039
Uh, chips? Uh, dip?
Uh, anything?

14:32.109 --> 14:33.201
Oh, yeah, Mac.

14:33.277 --> 14:35.006
Right here in the tinfoil.
Help yourself.

14:36.347 --> 14:38.872
You know, you're right.
You are right, Mac.

14:38.949 --> 14:41.645
I'm gonna do this one last
thing for Thomas, and that's it.

14:41.719 --> 14:43.186
<i>Finito.</i> I'm finished.

14:43.254 --> 14:45.415
You mean he's got you
on something now?

14:45.489 --> 14:47.423
Yeah, he's got me
running down some guy.

14:47.491 --> 14:49.118
Used to be
with British Intelligence.

14:50.261 --> 14:51.785
You know,
that's just like Magnum.

14:51.862 --> 14:54.524
I mean, he knows I'm not gonna do it,
so he pawns it off on you.

14:54.598 --> 14:56.566
Ha! My good luck.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.124
And how are you
going to do it?

14:58.202 --> 15:00.796
I mean, this guy is
no underworid figure.

15:02.073 --> 15:03.267
No offense.

15:03.707 --> 15:06.471
It's just that your... your
connections aren't gonna help out here.

15:06.544 --> 15:07.875
Well, they haven't.

15:07.945 --> 15:09.936
Of course they haven't.

15:10.614 --> 15:12.809
I'll tell you what you need.

15:13.417 --> 15:15.942
You need a contact
in Intelligence.

15:16.887 --> 15:19.048
Yeah. I guess you're right.

15:19.123 --> 15:20.920
Of course I'm right.

15:22.226 --> 15:25.093
You, uh...
You got anything on this guy?

15:26.430 --> 15:29.092
Oh, well,
just this lousy 2-by-3 photo,

15:29.166 --> 15:30.895
but that was taken
about 5 years ago.

15:30.968 --> 15:32.162
Yeah?
Let me see it.

15:32.236 --> 15:35.865
No, no. Listen, man, come on,
we came out here to have fun and fish.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.704
Come on, Rick.
What are buddies for, huh?

15:39.043 --> 15:40.772
Come on.
Well,

15:41.045 --> 15:42.535
only on one condition.

15:42.613 --> 15:46.515
That you promise to accept one of the
finest bottles of wine from the club.

15:46.584 --> 15:48.882
You know, Rick.
You're a gentleman.

15:48.953 --> 15:50.944
That's the difference
between you and Magnum.

15:51.021 --> 15:52.852
You are a gentleman.

15:53.624 --> 15:54.750
<i>Come on, Higgins.</i>

15:54.825 --> 15:56.690
<i>I need a good bottle.</i>
<i>I owe it to a friend.</i>

15:56.827 --> 15:58.590
I've already
provided you with wine.

15:58.662 --> 16:00.425
I said a good bottle,
Higgins.

16:00.498 --> 16:03.558
The stuff you gave me had been
aged for 2 weeks in aluminum.

16:03.634 --> 16:07.161
Even so, it contains 12 pct.
Alcohol. I should think
that's all you'd care about.

16:07.238 --> 16:09.229
Come on, Higgins,
I'll even pay for it.

16:09.306 --> 16:10.933
Ah, the magic words.

16:11.008 --> 16:13.442
And always the last ones
out of your mouth.

16:13.511 --> 16:15.103
Red, white, or sparkling?

16:15.179 --> 16:18.171
Red.
And something old and French.

16:18.816 --> 16:20.443
And real musty.

16:20.885 --> 16:22.352
This should do.

16:22.419 --> 16:25.013
A 1971 Margaux.
Chateau Andre.

16:25.456 --> 16:27.515
A small but rather
impressive vineyard.

16:27.591 --> 16:28.956
Oh, that sounds perfect.

16:29.026 --> 16:31.119
$37.50. Cash.

16:31.829 --> 16:34.161
Cash? Oh, come on, Higgins,
couldn't we just...

16:34.231 --> 16:35.823
No, we couldn't.

16:41.472 --> 16:46.102
Oh, by the way, Higgins,
I also need some information.

16:46.944 --> 16:48.639
You can't possibly
afford it.

16:48.712 --> 16:50.805
Oh, come on, Higgins.
I'm buying your wine.

16:50.881 --> 16:52.007
My wine?

16:52.082 --> 16:53.549
Magnum, I'm doing this
as a favor.

16:53.617 --> 16:56.177
I'm not even making a
profit for the estate.

16:56.253 --> 16:57.311
Well, forget it.

16:57.388 --> 17:01.347
You probably don't have the kind
of information that I need anyway.

17:01.425 --> 17:03.689
It's not like
you were a member of Ml6.

17:03.761 --> 17:07.527
I most certainly was.
I served with Ml6 in Northern Ireland.

17:07.897 --> 17:08.955
Oh, really?

17:10.166 --> 17:14.262
You wouldn't happen to know a chap
named David Banister, would you?

17:15.506 --> 17:16.530
No.

17:17.942 --> 17:20.205
Not personally.
I know of him.

17:20.477 --> 17:23.810
He was a field operative,
and a very good one, until...

17:23.881 --> 17:26.509
Field operative? I thought
he was a strategist.

17:26.584 --> 17:28.415
He was
an operative.

17:28.819 --> 17:29.911
Are you sure?

17:29.987 --> 17:33.150
Of course I'm sure. I was attached
to Gen. Cornwall at the time

17:33.224 --> 17:34.851
and he was the strategist.

17:34.925 --> 17:37.485
It wasn't a very big club,
you know.

17:37.962 --> 17:41.295
But I was saying,
he was an excellent field operative

17:41.365 --> 17:42.423
until the scandal.

17:42.933 --> 17:44.264
A sex scandal?

17:44.335 --> 17:46.098
Unfortunately,
in British Intelligence,

17:46.170 --> 17:48.968
that seems to be
the only kind we have.

17:49.173 --> 17:52.631
Anyway, Banister's specialty
was disguises,

17:53.110 --> 17:55.374
especially posing as a female.

17:55.512 --> 17:57.537
It was thought to be
a jolly good show

17:57.615 --> 18:01.142
until he started showing up
at official functions in drag.

18:01.218 --> 18:02.947
He had the inordinate
bad taste

18:03.020 --> 18:05.045
to appear at
the Queen's Birthday Ball

18:05.122 --> 18:07.682
in the same gown
as the Lady Ashley.

18:09.093 --> 18:10.651
Extraordinary.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.740
What are you doing out here?

18:34.818 --> 18:37.753
I'm lost. Could you tell me which
way it is back to the main road?

18:37.821 --> 18:39.152
Oh, yeah.
You just turn around...

19:49.727 --> 19:52.287
<i>The Popular Front movement</i>
<i>is a serious threat</i>

19:52.363 --> 19:54.058
to democracy in Jororo.

19:54.131 --> 19:57.794
And the nature of democracy makes
it particularly difficult for us.

19:57.868 --> 20:01.167
The Front and we operate
under very different rules.

20:01.238 --> 20:03.729
But Mr. Prime Minister,
aren't there times

20:03.807 --> 20:06.173
when the rules of democracy
can be bent?

20:06.243 --> 20:09.144
For me, as a Christian,
I could not do so.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.813
I like to think, though,
that is my final strength.

20:13.217 --> 20:16.482
So, since you don't consider
repression as a tool,

20:16.553 --> 20:18.987
how do you intend
to combat the Popular Front?

20:19.056 --> 20:22.150
My goal is to ameliorate
the economic conditions

20:22.226 --> 20:24.353
which have helped
to spawn the movement.

20:24.428 --> 20:27.693
It is a matter of taking care
and treating the disease

20:27.765 --> 20:29.562
rather than the more
unpleasant symptoms.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.997
The trade agreement that I'm
signing with the United States

20:34.071 --> 20:35.800
is a large part
of my plan.

20:35.873 --> 20:37.101
Hello.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.934
It's for you. Your editor.

20:40.778 --> 20:42.905
No, please.
It is all right.

20:47.484 --> 20:48.542
Hello?

20:48.619 --> 20:50.985
<i>Have you located Banister?</i>

20:51.054 --> 20:53.852
No. Not yet.
I'm working on it.

20:55.893 --> 20:57.554
<i>You'd better work fast,</i>
<i>Miss Sullivan.</i>

20:57.628 --> 20:58.856
<i>He's got explosives.</i>

20:58.929 --> 21:00.328
<i>He's going to blow up Santos.</i>

21:00.397 --> 21:02.627
<i>I'll call you</i>
<i>as soon as I know when.</i>

21:02.699 --> 21:03.859
I understand.

21:06.637 --> 21:08.867
Editors. Always pushing.

21:09.673 --> 21:11.334
Pushing a deadline.

21:15.412 --> 21:17.243
<i>The difference</i>
<i>between a strategist</i>

21:17.314 --> 21:18.975
<i>and an operative</i>
<i>in the spy game</i>

21:19.049 --> 21:21.643
<i>is as big as a coach</i>
<i>and a player in football.</i>

21:21.718 --> 21:23.447
<i>Maybe Kate had just</i>
<i>made a mistake,</i>

21:23.520 --> 21:24.782
<i>but it wasn't like her.</i>

21:24.855 --> 21:28.086
<i>Or rather, it wasn't like</i>
<i>the Kate I used to know.</i>

21:28.459 --> 21:31.895
<i>We were going to meet later at the club,</i>
<i>but I decided to push it up.</i>

21:31.962 --> 21:34.590
<i>I don't know why,</i>
<i>but that little voice in my head</i>

21:34.665 --> 21:37.293
<i>said seeing her interview</i>
<i>Santos might be important.</i>

21:48.479 --> 21:49.776
I'll only be here
a few minutes.

21:49.847 --> 21:51.940
If I could just leave it here,
I'd appreciate it.

22:07.231 --> 22:11.099
Excuse me. Could you tell me what
floor the Jororo delegation is on?

22:11.168 --> 22:12.226
Jororo delegation?

22:12.302 --> 22:14.167
Well, actually,
it's Prime Minister Santos.

22:14.238 --> 22:17.173
I'd like to know
what floor his suite is on.

22:17.374 --> 22:19.365
I'm sorry.
There's no Jororo delegation

22:19.443 --> 22:21.809
and no Prime Minister Santos
registered here.

22:21.879 --> 22:22.971
You sure?

22:23.046 --> 22:24.843
Computers don't lie.

22:24.915 --> 22:26.712
Well, perhaps
the llona Reef Hotel.

22:26.783 --> 22:28.478
Sometimes people
confuse us with them.

22:28.552 --> 22:30.816
No, she said
the llona Seas.

22:30.888 --> 22:33.914
Well, maybe. L... I'll
check there.

22:33.991 --> 22:35.253
Thank you.
You bet.

22:48.272 --> 22:49.967
<i>Maybe I'd misunderstood Kate.</i>

22:50.040 --> 22:51.974
<i>Or maybe she'd made</i>
<i>an honest mistake.</i>

22:52.042 --> 22:55.034
<i>Either way, that little voice</i>
<i>in my head was getting louder,</i>

22:55.112 --> 22:57.910
<i>and I didn't like</i>
<i>what it was whispering.</i>

23:11.428 --> 23:15.296
<i>Then my little voice stopped</i>
<i>whispering and started screaming.</i>

23:35.852 --> 23:37.319
Long time no see.

23:37.387 --> 23:39.252
Yeah.

23:39.489 --> 23:41.548
Look. Um, I was wondering...

23:41.625 --> 23:43.388
If I could give you
a little info?

23:43.460 --> 23:44.654
Yeah, how'd you know?

23:44.728 --> 23:47.959
When you've been at it as long as
I have, you can smell it, bruh.

23:48.031 --> 23:49.999
That's amazing.

23:50.834 --> 23:52.734
I don't handle
negotiations,

23:52.803 --> 23:55.237
but I do take
20 pct. Off the top.

23:55.305 --> 23:57.933
Now, you want an island girl or a <i>haole?</i>

23:58.008 --> 24:00.670
Uh, that's not the kind
of information I want.

24:00.744 --> 24:02.109
No?

24:02.179 --> 24:04.010
Oh, you're looking
for a game.

24:04.081 --> 24:07.346
I got a poker game up on the
12th with a $2,000 minimum.

24:07.417 --> 24:10.545
Craps on 18, but only...
No, no, no. No gambling.

24:10.621 --> 24:13.089
What the hell
are you looking for?

24:13.857 --> 24:15.848
I'm with hotel security.

24:16.293 --> 24:18.591
I knew that Ferrari wasn't yours!

24:18.662 --> 24:21.961
Man, this is so unfair. Entrapment.
That's what it is. Entrapment.

24:22.032 --> 24:24.694
Calm down, will you? Just calm down.
Somebody's gonna hear you.

24:24.768 --> 24:27.032
I'm just gonna give you
a warning this time.

24:27.104 --> 24:30.505
Actually, see, I'm here
to keep on top of security

24:30.574 --> 24:33.304
for one of the parties
up on the, uh...

24:35.646 --> 24:36.738
4th floor?

24:37.180 --> 24:38.272
4th floor.

24:38.749 --> 24:40.080
That island delegation?

24:40.150 --> 24:41.242
Jororo.

24:41.318 --> 24:42.683
Nobody told me
their name.

24:42.753 --> 24:44.345
Just to keep it hush-hush.

24:44.421 --> 24:46.389
Good. See that you do.
Yes, sir.

24:46.456 --> 24:48.856
Oh, and keep an eye on my car,
will you, while I'm gone?

24:48.925 --> 24:52.019
Yes, sir. Hey, you don't have
to worry about that other stuff.

24:52.095 --> 24:54.359
It was just
a sideline anyway.

25:12.883 --> 25:14.248
Suite 400.

25:18.622 --> 25:21.250
Excuse me. Uh, this floor
is closed for repairs.

25:21.324 --> 25:23.792
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

26:20.716 --> 26:22.183
Why'd you lie to me, Kate?

26:22.251 --> 26:23.275
Not so loud.

26:23.352 --> 26:24.842
I can shout
if I need to.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.150
There's no need to,
you have my total attention.

26:27.222 --> 26:29.349
Good.
Then start explaining.

26:29.558 --> 26:32.049
Not here. I told you
I'd meet you at the club.

26:32.127 --> 26:34.527
You also told me the Santos
story was a milk run.

26:34.596 --> 26:36.564
Come on,
this place is secured like Fort Knox.

26:36.632 --> 26:37.758
He's a head of state.

26:37.833 --> 26:40.427
They tend to have good security because,
if you haven't noticed,

26:40.502 --> 26:42.527
the worid's a bit crazy,
heads of state get shot.

26:42.604 --> 26:45.129
Kate, the hotel won't even
admit that he's here.

26:45.207 --> 26:46.970
I didn't know that.

26:47.709 --> 26:49.973
Look, what's
Banister's connection?

26:50.379 --> 26:52.176
Nothing.
It's a... a separate issue.

26:52.247 --> 26:54.272
OK. Fine. Then when Santos'
security chief comes back,

26:54.349 --> 26:56.180
you won't mind me
telling him all about it.

26:56.251 --> 26:57.718
Thomas...
Kate, I want some answers,

26:57.786 --> 26:58.878
Shh.
And I want them now.

26:58.954 --> 27:01.013
Ok. All right, as soon as
my interview is over.

27:01.089 --> 27:04.081
Everything, I promise.
Just don't talk about it here.

27:05.961 --> 27:09.954
Please, huh?
Old times' sake. Trust me.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.994
Ok, it checks.
You're a private investigator.

27:15.070 --> 27:17.595
But you were also in Naval
Intelligence for a while.

27:17.673 --> 27:19.800
You want to tell me
about that?

27:19.875 --> 27:22.742
My guess is you were once
Secret Service or CIA.

27:22.811 --> 27:24.802
You want to tell me
about that?

27:24.880 --> 27:25.938
The whole worid

27:26.014 --> 27:27.606
Hates a wise guy.

27:27.683 --> 27:30.447
I know. You through
with your questions?

27:31.320 --> 27:32.582
Miss Sullivan,
you were granted

27:32.654 --> 27:34.713
an exclusive interview
with the Prime Minister

27:34.790 --> 27:37.554
on the condition that his being
here would be kept secret.

27:37.626 --> 27:39.958
Not entirely correct,
Mr. Russler.

27:40.028 --> 27:42.087
I knew that the Prime Minister
was to be here.

27:42.164 --> 27:44.291
And because I knew,
I was granted an interview.

27:44.366 --> 27:46.766
I'm not going to quibble
with you over words.

27:46.835 --> 27:49.133
You had no right to tell
anybody else what you knew,

27:49.204 --> 27:50.364
especially a P.I.

27:50.439 --> 27:52.930
Mr. Magnum and I
happen to be old friends.

27:53.008 --> 27:54.339
It just came out.

27:54.409 --> 27:55.433
It won't happen again,

27:55.510 --> 27:58.377
and I'm sure that Thomas will
be happy to keep it to himself.

28:02.517 --> 28:03.950
OK, Magnum.

28:04.620 --> 28:07.248
I'm gonna let you go this time,
but for the record,

28:07.322 --> 28:11.315
if I catch your face around here again,
I'm gonna get real nasty.

28:13.028 --> 28:14.586
Miss Sullivan.

28:16.365 --> 28:17.923
See you later?

28:18.166 --> 28:19.724
Scout's honor.

28:28.744 --> 28:30.712
<i>There's an old rule</i>
<i>in this business:</i>

28:30.779 --> 28:32.178
<i>Anger doesn't win.</i>

28:32.247 --> 28:35.273
<i>And at the moment</i>
<i>I'd had a belly full of it.</i>

28:36.351 --> 28:37.818
<i>So, before I faced Kate again,</i>

28:37.886 --> 28:39.547
<i>all I wanted to do</i>
<i>was cool down</i>

28:39.621 --> 28:42.749
<i>and figured the best way to do</i>
<i>it was at the club with Rick.</i>

28:42.824 --> 28:44.052
Rick?

28:45.694 --> 28:46.786
Hi, guys.

28:46.862 --> 28:49.387
Don't "Hi, guys" me.
Thomas, what are you up to?

28:49.464 --> 28:50.658
Up to?

28:51.533 --> 28:52.761
Where'd you get that?

28:52.834 --> 28:55.200
From the little bird
you asked to show it to me.

28:55.270 --> 28:56.532
Now, Magnum,
I'm warning you.

28:56.605 --> 28:59.073
No more Mr. Nice Guy.
Not with something like this.

28:59.141 --> 29:00.199
Like what?

29:00.275 --> 29:03.802
Magnum, do you have any idea who
it is you're dealing with here?

29:03.879 --> 29:06.541
Well, I know he used to be
an operative with Ml6,

29:06.615 --> 29:08.742
and that he quit,
or was kicked out,

29:08.817 --> 29:10.580
because he liked
to dress up like giris,

29:10.652 --> 29:11.880
and that he's writing a book.

29:11.953 --> 29:13.853
I don't think he's the
literate type, Thomas.

29:13.922 --> 29:16.152
Magnum, Banister isn't
writing any books.

29:16.224 --> 29:18.124
He's selling himself
to the highest bidder.

29:18.193 --> 29:20.525
He's an international
assassin. A killer.

29:20.595 --> 29:24.053
Every police department in
the worid is looking for him.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.285
<i>Telephone call</i>
<i>for Ms. Kate Sullivan.</i>

31:34.362 --> 31:36.796
<i>Telephone call</i>
<i>for Kate Sullivan.</i>

31:38.400 --> 31:40.129
I'm Kate Sullivan.

31:40.869 --> 31:42.063
Hello?

31:42.137 --> 31:43.434
<i>Have you found him?</i>

31:43.505 --> 31:45.370
Not yet.
And I'm getting worried.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.499
I almost warned
Santos' security people today.

31:47.576 --> 31:50.443
<i>When to do that is your decision.</i>
<i>It's your story.</i>

31:50.512 --> 31:52.002
<i>It's going to happen Monday.</i>

31:52.080 --> 31:55.243
<i>At the State House, when Santos</i>
<i>goes in to sign the agreement.</i>

31:55.317 --> 31:57.615
Not till Monday? Good, good,
that'll give me time...

32:02.090 --> 32:03.489
Thank you.

32:07.796 --> 32:11.129
You know, Kate,
I don't know who I'm angrier at.

32:11.666 --> 32:13.691
You for lying to me
or me for trusting you.

32:13.768 --> 32:16.999
But let's just start from the top.
Why'd you lie to me?

32:17.072 --> 32:19.370
I was afraid you wouldn't help
me if I told you the truth.

32:19.441 --> 32:23.434
Wrong. You were afraid I'd go to
the authorities and blow your scoop.

32:23.512 --> 32:26.037
If you know all the answers,
why the hell ask me the questions?

32:26.114 --> 32:28.048
Because you've lost
all sense of proportion.

32:28.116 --> 32:29.811
Of reality.
Come on, Kate.

32:29.885 --> 32:31.785
A man's life is at stake here,
isn't it?

32:31.853 --> 32:33.411
Santos' life.

32:34.089 --> 32:35.249
Yes.

32:35.824 --> 32:38.622
The Popular Front of Jororo
hired Banister to kill Santos.

32:38.693 --> 32:40.388
And I hired you
to find him.

32:40.462 --> 32:43.295
You hired me to find him so you
could have your little scoop.

32:43.365 --> 32:46.266
What were you gonna do, Kate?
Film the assassination?

32:54.009 --> 32:56.136
Kate,
what happened to you?

32:56.378 --> 32:58.744
I lost 3 inches
off my right leg.

32:59.147 --> 33:02.446
You have any idea what that did to me?
Or my career?

33:03.351 --> 33:06.184
It's lousy to be a has-been
before you're 40.

33:06.254 --> 33:09.985
Finding Banister, getting an interview,
maybe being in on the capture,

33:10.058 --> 33:12.720
that could put me
back where I belong.

33:13.061 --> 33:15.825
Not to mention
where it could put Santos.

33:15.897 --> 33:17.296
Where are you going?

33:17.365 --> 33:19.731
I'm gonna call Russler
and tell him what I know.

33:19.801 --> 33:22.736
Magnum, please.
I'm not a villain.

33:23.271 --> 33:27.037
I have a source in the Popular Front.
He calls me every day.

33:27.509 --> 33:30.069
Banister's gonna hit Santos
Monday, at the State House.

33:30.145 --> 33:32.477
If you haven't found him
by Sunday noon

33:32.547 --> 33:35.539
I'll go to Russler,
I'll tell him all I know.

33:35.884 --> 33:37.215
Please.

33:37.285 --> 33:40.083
Could be my last chance
for an exclusive.

33:40.922 --> 33:42.787
Don't make that call.

33:43.858 --> 33:45.325
OK, I won't.

33:47.963 --> 33:50.261
Just as long as you do it.
Now.

34:12.420 --> 34:15.286
<i>It's got a lock.</i>
<i>I'm going to pick it.</i>

34:15.357 --> 34:17.324
Have you got anything else
on this informant?

34:17.391 --> 34:18.380
Nothing.

34:20.829 --> 34:24.925
He first contacted me when I was
in Paris covering a fashion show.

34:25.100 --> 34:28.159
And he's called me half
a dozen times since then.

34:28.503 --> 34:30.835
I never know when or how
he knows where to find me.

34:30.905 --> 34:32.371
He just does.

34:32.440 --> 34:33.873
<i>Hey, lock's open.</i>

34:33.942 --> 34:35.466
I'm going in.

35:07.842 --> 35:10.572
There's enough explosives in
here to bring down the block.

35:11.079 --> 35:12.478
<i>But no detonator.</i>

35:13.381 --> 35:14.678
I don't get it.

35:14.749 --> 35:17.274
He'll probably use
a radio-activated detonator.

35:17.352 --> 35:18.979
No sense risking
a stray transmission,

35:19.054 --> 35:21.921
like from a walkie-talkie,
setting it off.

35:23.224 --> 35:25.419
Anyway, he's going to have to
come back to arm it.

35:25.527 --> 35:26.721
And that's when we nail him.

35:26.795 --> 35:28.524
I want in on the kill.

35:28.596 --> 35:31.190
Miss Sullivan,
just as soon as we have him locked up,

35:31.266 --> 35:33.029
we'll let you know.

35:33.101 --> 35:34.295
Sure.

35:34.736 --> 35:36.966
Along with the rest
of the media worid.

35:37.038 --> 35:39.302
The Prime Minister appreciates
everything that you've...

35:39.374 --> 35:41.171
Oh, don't thank me.

35:42.010 --> 35:43.875
Thank my friend here.

35:51.686 --> 35:53.677
Do you want me
to close this back up again?

35:53.755 --> 35:57.088
<i>Yes, I want everything left</i>
<i>the way it was.</i>

36:13.639 --> 36:16.199
<i>It was Sunday morning,</i>
<i>and down at the State House,</i>

36:16.275 --> 36:19.108
<i>Russler had everyone from the</i>
<i>CIA to Interpol staked out</i>

36:19.178 --> 36:20.839
<i>waiting for Banister to show.</i>

36:20.913 --> 36:22.505
<i>Which should have</i>
<i>made me feel good.</i>

36:22.582 --> 36:23.674
<i>It didn't.</i>

36:23.750 --> 36:27.277
<i>I couldn't shake the feeling</i>
<i>that it had been too easy.</i>

36:36.562 --> 36:38.086
Good morning.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.294
Morning.

36:42.135 --> 36:43.261
You want some coffee?

36:43.336 --> 36:44.803
I can do it.

36:51.711 --> 36:53.303
I don't know why I'm here.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.745
I'd like to think
because I asked.

36:55.815 --> 36:57.373
I'm mad at you.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.075
And I'm mad at you,

36:59.152 --> 37:02.349
but that's not gonna get
either one of us anywhere.

37:02.622 --> 37:05.489
So you asked me
to come here. Why?

37:05.558 --> 37:07.355
To get
a little perspective.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.950
From you?
I already got it.

37:09.028 --> 37:11.258
No. From a friend.

37:12.932 --> 37:14.331
Would you run
that tape, please?

37:14.400 --> 37:17.028
<i>One minute.</i>
<i>It'll be up on monitor 5.</i>

37:18.571 --> 37:21.335
It took a little doing,
but I got a buddy of mine in New York

37:21.407 --> 37:24.865
to get this transmission
satellited here this morning.

37:27.580 --> 37:28.842
What is this?

37:28.915 --> 37:31.179
<i>Most of the day, I've been</i>
<i>watching wounded Marines</i>

37:31.250 --> 37:33.047
<i>being medevaced off this hill.</i>

37:33.119 --> 37:34.677
<i>On the balance sheet</i>
<i>of the war,</i>

37:34.754 --> 37:37.723
<i>this skirmish may be represented</i>
<i>by only a few statistics,</i>

37:37.790 --> 37:40.122
<i>but it's a great deal</i>
<i>more than that.</i>

37:40.193 --> 37:42.320
<i>The troops here</i>
<i>are boys we all know.</i>

37:42.395 --> 37:46.092
<i>They live next door,</i>
<i>they play football on Sunday afternoons.</i>

37:46.165 --> 37:48.759
<i>They walk down church aisles</i>
<i>to meet their brides.</i>

37:48.835 --> 37:50.393
<i>But quite a few</i>
<i>of the boys I've seen</i>

37:50.469 --> 37:52.266
<i>won't be doing</i>
<i>those things anymore.</i>

37:52.338 --> 37:54.738
<i>The scuttlebutt here</i>
<i>is that this outpost</i>

37:54.807 --> 37:57.367
<i>isn't strategic</i>
<i>to the defense of Binh Lao,</i>

37:57.443 --> 38:01.880
<i>that the brass want it held</i>
<i>so they won't have to move</i>
<i>the pins in their maps.</i>

38:01.948 --> 38:04.109
<i>I don't know if that's true.</i>

38:04.550 --> 38:06.108
<i>I doubt it is.</i>

38:06.652 --> 38:10.713
<i>What is true is that human</i>
<i>life seems cheap up here.</i>

38:11.824 --> 38:14.987
<i>Seems to have lost</i>
<i>the respect it ought to have.</i>

38:15.228 --> 38:18.686
<i>And for me,</i>
<i>that's the saddest thing of all.</i>

38:19.832 --> 38:21.766
<i>This is Kate Sullivan.</i>

38:21.901 --> 38:24.233
<i>Binh Lao, South Vietnam.</i>

38:51.998 --> 38:54.728
<i>You want that other tape now?</i>

38:55.968 --> 38:57.902
Hold that tape.

39:03.309 --> 39:04.435
Don't...

39:10.283 --> 39:11.307
You OK?

39:11.384 --> 39:13.113
Y- yeah. Or...

39:14.520 --> 39:15.817
Maybe.

39:19.659 --> 39:20.887
Maybe for...

39:25.264 --> 39:27.926
for the first time
in a very long time.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.432
Thank you, Thomas.

39:39.011 --> 39:41.309
Uh, you can roll
that tape now.

39:45.017 --> 39:46.507
What you up to?

39:46.585 --> 39:49.986
Besides, uh, straightening out
dumb old friends?

39:51.257 --> 39:54.784
Kate, I just don't like
this Banister thing.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.693
Mac gave me his dossier
and I can tell you,

39:57.763 --> 39:59.958
from the things this guy
is suspected of doing,

40:00.032 --> 40:02.967
he's not the kind
to make a simple mistake.

40:03.302 --> 40:04.860
What mistake?
The van.

40:04.937 --> 40:07.269
He wouldn't park it there
2 days early.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.968
<i>That tape's coming up</i>
<i>on monitor 5.</i>

40:10.042 --> 40:13.307
M- my buddy also got me
this tape of Banister.

40:13.379 --> 40:15.176
It was an attempt
to interview him

40:15.247 --> 40:17.681
when the scandal
broke in London.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.020
<i>Mr. Banister, do you intend</i>
<i>to protest your dismissal?</i>

40:24.090 --> 40:26.422
<i>I have nothing to say.</i>
<i>I leave all that to my solicitor.</i>

40:26.492 --> 40:30.394
<i>Then you intend to deny the</i>
<i>charges that you're a transvestite?</i>

40:34.867 --> 40:36.391
That's a waste.

40:36.469 --> 40:39.336
No. Play it back.
Play that again, Thomas.

40:41.374 --> 40:43.308
Could you run that
again, please?

40:43.376 --> 40:45.241
Kate, what is it?
Just... just let me listen.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.773
<i>Mr. Bannister, do you intend</i>
<i>to protest your dismissal?</i>

40:48.848 --> 40:51.180
<i>I have nothing to say.</i>
<i>I leave all that to my solicitor.</i>

40:51.250 --> 40:54.742
<i>Then you intend to deny the</i>
<i>charges that you're a transvestite?</i>

40:55.354 --> 40:57.822
That's the voice.
That's... that's...

40:58.024 --> 41:00.288
That's the voice
of my source.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.854
The man who's been
tipping me off is Banister.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.260
Damn it!
I knew it was too easy.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.431
As long as he stays
at the hotel,

41:09.502 --> 41:10.764
Santos will be
relatively safe.

41:10.836 --> 41:11.928
Hello?
Bannister's gonna try

41:12.004 --> 41:13.835
and hit him on the route
to the State House.

41:13.906 --> 41:16.272
This is Kate Sullivan.
Could you get me Mr. Russler, please?

41:16.342 --> 41:18.071
It's an emergency.

41:18.377 --> 41:19.537
What?

41:20.146 --> 41:21.579
Oh, my God.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.978
Santos has gone
to a private mass.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.217
<i>Our Lady of the Holy Veil.</i>

41:26.285 --> 41:28.253
<i>Thomas, it's a convent.</i>

41:54.613 --> 41:55.705
Welcome to our church,
sir.

41:55.781 --> 41:56.907
Thank you, Father.

41:56.982 --> 41:59.314
Mr. Prime Minister,
this is our Mother Superior.

41:59.385 --> 42:01.285
Let's go right inside.

42:17.570 --> 42:18.594
Sisters,

42:18.671 --> 42:20.901
this is the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister, Sister Mary.

42:20.973 --> 42:21.997
Sister.

42:22.074 --> 42:23.302
Sister Faith.
Sister.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.672
Sister Ann.
Sister.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.677
Sister Barbara.
Sister.

42:55.774 --> 42:59.801
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

42:59.979 --> 43:01.412
let us pray.

43:05.317 --> 43:08.252
Let us pray that God
will bring peace to the worid

43:08.320 --> 43:10.379
and freedom to his church.

43:13.125 --> 43:16.288
Lord, guide the course
of worid events

43:16.595 --> 43:20.622
and give your church the joy and
peace of serving you in freedom.

43:21.634 --> 43:23.329
I'm sorry, Sister.

43:24.003 --> 43:25.231
We ask this

43:25.304 --> 43:27.636
through our Lord Jesus Christ,
your Son

43:27.706 --> 43:30.436
who lives and reigns
with you and the Holy Spirit

43:30.509 --> 43:31.635
one God

43:31.710 --> 43:33.109
For ever and ever.

43:33.312 --> 43:34.336
Amen.

43:45.958 --> 43:48.586
Blessed are you,
Lord God of all Creation.

43:48.661 --> 43:52.358
For your goodness,
we have this bread to offer

43:52.431 --> 43:55.832
which earth has given,
and human hands have made.

43:56.235 --> 43:58.931
May it become for us
the bread of life.

44:02.408 --> 44:04.933
Blessed are you,
Lord God of all Creation.

44:05.010 --> 44:08.173
Through your goodness
we have this wine to offer.

44:08.247 --> 44:11.216
Fruit of the vine,
and work of human hands,

44:11.283 --> 44:13.148
it will become
our spiritual drink.

44:13.219 --> 44:14.447
Blessed be God.

44:22.895 --> 44:24.920
Get Russler out here now.

44:31.203 --> 44:32.670
In the name of the Father,

44:32.738 --> 44:34.865
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

44:34.940 --> 44:36.100
Amen.

44:48.687 --> 44:50.052
What the hell
is going on?

44:50.122 --> 44:52.181
It was a setup.
Banister was my source.

44:52.258 --> 44:54.021
What?
Bannister set up that bomb

44:54.093 --> 44:56.186
to throw security.
He's going to make the hit here.

44:56.262 --> 44:57.593
Let's go.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.927
What's going on?

45:07.539 --> 45:08.733
The balcony!

45:21.520 --> 45:23.215
Keep Santos here.

45:25.591 --> 45:26.751
Ahhh!

45:47.846 --> 45:49.143
Hold it!

45:55.321 --> 45:56.879
Sorry, Sister.

46:09.301 --> 46:10.928
Morning, Sister.

46:12.805 --> 46:14.500
Good morning, sir.

46:25.317 --> 46:27.148
Nuns don't work
on Sunday.

46:52.344 --> 46:54.812
To scoops
and front-page bylines.

46:55.881 --> 46:57.542
And dear friends.

46:58.283 --> 47:02.276
Without whom none of the rest of
this stuff really matters anyway.

47:12.798 --> 47:15.266
I know, Kate. It's not
a very good Bordeaux.

47:15.334 --> 47:17.894
See, Higgins made me
take this stuff because...

47:17.970 --> 47:19.904
The wine-tasting party!

47:19.972 --> 47:21.633
Where are we going?
Come on.

47:21.707 --> 47:23.868
I just remembered
where you could get a sip

47:23.942 --> 47:26.410
from a $5,000 Bordeaux.

47:27.513 --> 47:29.447
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

47:29.515 --> 47:30.982
<i>the piece de resistance:</i>

47:31.049 --> 47:34.018
<i>Chateau de Maurice, 1836.</i>

47:34.086 --> 47:35.417
I can't hear a thing.

47:35.487 --> 47:37.284
I wish this thing
would go louder.

47:37.356 --> 47:40.325
<i>This is a wine which deserves</i>
<i>the greatest respect.</i>

47:40.392 --> 47:44.089
<i>It is testimony to our having</i>
<i>come a long way from Bacchus.</i>

47:44.163 --> 47:46.324
<i>Enology elevated to art,</i>

47:46.398 --> 47:48.866
<i>enriched further</i>
<i>by the hand of time.</i>

47:48.934 --> 47:51.664
I say there, old boy, do you
understand a word of what he's saying?

47:51.737 --> 47:53.227
He said
it's all good stuff.

47:53.305 --> 47:54.363
Oh.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.238
<i>The cork is sound.</i>
<i>Your glasses, please.</i>

47:57.309 --> 47:59.106
Oh, I got to hear this.
Come on, T.C.,

47:59.178 --> 48:00.736
find a way to turn the volume up.
How?

48:02.481 --> 48:03.743
Hi, guys.

48:03.816 --> 48:06.046
Thomas, is this how
you turn the volume up?

48:06.118 --> 48:07.312
Oh, no!

48:10.956 --> 48:13.015
What's that hissing noise?

48:13.592 --> 48:15.651
Bye, guys.
<i>Magnum!</i>

48:16.929 --> 48:19.454
<i>You irresponsible cretin!</i>

48:22.734 --> 48:25.328
I might be dumb but I ain't stupid.
Let's go.
