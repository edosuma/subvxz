the sky.

There must be a scientific

to gumball, like there is for

know if it's a 4-leaf clover?

they're extremely rare.

around eventually.

What's the scientific

explanation for all of this?!
>> Anais: Oh, there's no
explanation.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.263
What's been happening is just a
coincidental series of
unfortunate events.

16:39.265 --> 16:42.800
>> Gumball: Huh?
>> Anais: Look, I'm just gonna
have to show you.

16:42.802 --> 16:48.206
Okay, opening an umbrella
indoors, breaking a mirror, and
walking under a ladder are all

16:48.208 --> 16:51.743
considered to bring extremely
bad luck.
Ha! Nonsense.

16:51.745 --> 16:56.481
And to prove this, you're going
to perform all three tasks at
the same time.

>> Gumball: You sure about this?
>> Anais: Mathematically, the
chance of anything else

17:01.788 --> 17:06.591

I've been thinking

figured it out!

>> Darwin: It was probably the
luckiest thing i have ever seen.

17:55.909 --> 18:01.312
So, according to my findings,
gumball used up all his good
luck in one day, and that's why

18:01.314 --> 18:05.383
today he's left with nothing but
bad luck!
>> Gumball: Of course!

18:05.385 --> 18:09.454
>> Anais: [ Inhales deeply ]
That doesn't make sense, but
it's the best we got.

18:09.456 --> 18:13.991
So, the logical conclusion to
your nonsensical theory is that
if he can survive today,

18:13.993 --> 18:18.596
everything should be back to
normal by tomorrow!
