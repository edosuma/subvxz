- What the fuck?

02:26.920 --> 02:27.960
- [Patrick] Hello?

02:27.960 --> 02:29.106
- Hi, Patrick.

02:29.106 --> 02:30.440
(Patrick sighs)

02:30.440 --> 02:32.820
Come on, it's not that late.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.860
- [Patrick] It is when your kids are gonna

02:33.860 --> 02:35.493
be waking you up in a few hours.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.880
- Just do what Mom did,
tell 'em to get their asses

02:38.880 --> 02:40.660
back in bed or else Santa
will give their presents

02:40.660 --> 02:42.543
to poor black kids.

02:42.543 --> 02:43.390
(Patrick chuckles)

02:43.390 --> 02:45.770
- [Patrick] God, she was a bitch.

02:45.770 --> 02:47.290
- Was?

02:47.290 --> 02:49.847
Oh, right, now she's a cunt.

02:49.847 --> 02:52.264
(Patrick laughs)

02:53.970 --> 02:56.900
Um, hey, remember at lunch the other day

02:56.900 --> 02:59.320
that book I was reading,
"Undiscovered Girl"?

02:59.320 --> 03:01.510
The one about the teenage blogger?

03:01.510 --> 03:03.420
- [Patrick] Are you smoking?

03:03.420 --> 03:04.310
- What?

03:04.310 --> 03:05.980
No, I quit.

03:05.980 --> 03:06.813
Stop.

03:06.813 --> 03:09.620
Look, anyway, I just
finished reading the book

03:09.620 --> 03:13.570
and at the end Katie,
that's the blogger's name,

03:13.570 --> 03:17.286
Katie Kampenfelt, she goes missing.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.620
- [Patrick] What, you mean--

03:19.620 --> 03:22.070
- She narrates the whole
book and then at the end

03:23.010 --> 03:26.300
her mom takes over and says that a ton

03:26.300 --> 03:28.860
of what Katie told us about herself,

03:28.860 --> 03:32.403
even her name, it isn't true.

03:34.640 --> 03:39.540
And then after her last blog
entry she got into her car

03:40.660 --> 03:42.110
and she was never seen again.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.860
She's never used any of her credit cards

03:46.860 --> 03:49.073
and never used a cell phone.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.440
The mom wants us to try to help find her.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.740
- [Patrick] So, what are you--

03:54.740 --> 03:58.329
- I just, I need to know what
happened to her, you know?

03:58.329 --> 03:59.163
Like...

04:00.483 --> 04:03.310
Was she kidnapped?

04:03.310 --> 04:04.550
Did she run away?

04:04.550 --> 04:06.330
They discovered a dead
body at the end of the book

04:06.330 --> 04:09.110
but we don't know if it's Katie or not.

04:09.110 --> 04:11.630
- [Patrick] You're talking
about her like she's real.

04:11.630 --> 04:12.593
- She could be.

04:14.180 --> 04:17.010
Maybe it could be based on a true story.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.800
It's possible, right?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.490
- [Patrick] Where'd you buy the book?

04:20.490 --> 04:22.010
- Amazon.

04:22.010 --> 04:23.633
- [Patrick] Fiction or nonfiction?

04:25.460 --> 04:27.260
Wait, didn't you say a guy wrote it?

04:30.840 --> 04:32.518
- [Elle] I'm sorry, I'm-

04:32.518 --> 04:34.920
- [Patrick] Lonely, I know.

04:34.920 --> 04:35.873
Get some sleep.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.320
Come over whenever you want tomorrow.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.940
The earlier the better.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.230
Oh, hey, tell Mom to pick up a gallon

04:41.230 --> 04:42.621
of apple cider on the way.

04:42.621 --> 04:44.262
- [Elle] Okay.

04:44.262 --> 04:45.095
Love you.

04:45.095 --> 04:45.928
- [Patrick] Love you, too.

05:28.506 --> 05:30.981
(keyboard clicking)

05:51.000 --> 05:54.900
- [Elle Voiceover] Dear Katie,
I just finished your book

05:54.900 --> 05:56.393
and now I can't sleep.

05:57.880 --> 06:01.363
I keep imagining your body
lying in the woods somewhere.

06:04.260 --> 06:07.713
Empty eyes, wet, filthy hair.

06:09.890 --> 06:12.853
Bugs crawling inside your nose and ears.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.360
It's been awhile since
my mind turned this dark.

06:20.051 --> 06:20.913
What can I say?

06:23.220 --> 06:24.803
I'm by myself too much.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.400
I overthink everything.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.323
Anyway, I'm not an idiot.

06:34.690 --> 06:36.323
I know you're not really Katie.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.203
You're just an author.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.733
Some dude trying to sell books.

06:48.690 --> 06:53.690
But if you really were
Katie, we'd be best friends.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.273
I know it.

07:29.586 --> 07:30.419
- Who?

07:31.390 --> 07:32.223
- The writer.

07:33.470 --> 07:34.440
- Oh.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.780
He's probably too busy
jerking off in the mirror.

07:37.780 --> 07:39.451
- What do you mean?

07:39.451 --> 07:42.010
- Well, yeah, he wants to sell books,

07:42.010 --> 07:43.680
but he also wants fangirls to write him

07:43.680 --> 07:45.840
and tell him what a genius he is.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.480
(laughs) It's pathetic.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.313
Let it go.

07:49.930 --> 07:50.907
- Yeah.

07:50.907 --> 07:52.130

07:52.130 --> 07:54.653
- [Female Reader] Dear
Katie, I loved your book.

07:55.590 --> 07:58.460
I'm 16 and I live in a wheelchair.

07:58.460 --> 07:59.730
What happened to you?

07:59.730 --> 08:01.030
Are you dead?

08:01.030 --> 08:02.923
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

08:05.540 --> 08:08.590
- [Elle Voiceover] Dear
Katie, my father was a lawyer

08:08.590 --> 08:10.700
and a drug addict who beat the shit out

08:10.700 --> 08:12.113
of me and my two brothers.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.323
When I was in the third
grade he overdosed and died.

08:18.340 --> 08:21.203
It left a hole in my heart
so huge nothing can fill it.

08:22.660 --> 08:24.760
If you were real, I know you'd understand.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.150
(crickets chirping)
(keyboard clicking)

08:30.150 --> 08:33.320
Dear Katie, one night
last summer my boyfriend

08:33.320 --> 08:35.472
and I made love for three hours straight.

08:37.070 --> 08:39.592
Tonight memories of him tear me apart.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.793
If you're really flesh and blood,

08:45.250 --> 08:47.150
thank you so much for listening to me.

08:51.227 --> 08:53.177
(crickets chirping)

08:58.014 --> 08:59.431
(computer dings)

09:04.822 --> 09:07.631
(Elle sighs)
(light music)

09:15.875 --> 09:18.625
(haunting music)

09:23.138 --> 09:24.261
(keyboard clicking)

09:24.261 --> 09:26.128
Is this some sort of joke?

09:31.230 --> 09:33.043
Your mom said that you disappeared.

09:38.822 --> 09:40.256
(Elle sighs)

09:45.094 --> 09:46.986
(vape rustling)

09:57.830 --> 09:59.506
(Elle exhales)

10:00.614 --> 10:02.348
(Elle chuckles)

10:05.794 --> 10:07.402
(computer dings)

10:11.290 --> 10:14.390
- [Katie Voiceover] My mom
didn't write that, I did,

10:14.390 --> 10:15.963
and I never disappeared.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.785
(Elle gasps)

10:20.010 --> 10:21.850
I just wanted to end my blog forever,

10:21.850 --> 10:25.733
cancel my reality show, so
I pretended to be my mom.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.300
- [Elle Voiceover] But
if you're a real person

10:29.300 --> 10:31.980
why is your book sold as fiction?

10:31.980 --> 10:34.130
And why is there a
man's name on the cover?

10:35.210 --> 10:36.130
- [Katie Voiceover] Same reason I made up

10:36.130 --> 10:39.150
the name Katie Kampenfelt;
to be anonymous.

10:39.150 --> 10:42.180
I think private lives should stay private.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.763
I'm a big fan of boundaries.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.470
- [Elle Voiceover] Do you
write back to every reader

10:46.470 --> 10:47.493
who contacts you?

10:48.900 --> 10:50.650
- [Katie Voiceover]
Actually, you're the first.

10:50.650 --> 10:55.040
It's obvious you're smart,
cool, and need a friend.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.310
So do I.

10:56.310 --> 11:00.060
And according to your Facebook
we live only 87 miles apart,

11:00.060 --> 11:01.010
which is wonderful.

11:03.180 --> 11:04.330
- [Elle Voiceover] But
if you never write back

11:04.330 --> 11:06.330
why even bother having a contact button?

11:07.670 --> 11:12.110
- [Katie Voiceover]
Because I love being loved.

11:12.110 --> 11:13.883
What's better than fan mail?

11:14.810 --> 11:16.610
You wouldn't believe how much I get.

11:19.592 --> 11:20.867
(Elle sighs)

11:24.024 --> 11:27.041
(light music)
(crickets chirping)

11:35.780 --> 11:39.140
- [Author] Elle, my publisher
forwarded me your letter.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.470
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

11:40.470 --> 11:43.463
but I have nothing to do
with KatieKampenfelt.com.

11:45.090 --> 11:46.850
I have no idea who created this site

11:46.850 --> 11:48.880
or who's emailing you, but it's not Katie,

11:48.880 --> 11:50.720
because she doesn't exist.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.530
She's just a character I invented.

11:52.530 --> 11:55.290
- She is not and never was real.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.123
Be well.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.490
- So, what should I do about fake Katie?

11:59.490 --> 12:01.200
- Nothing.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.033
I'll do it.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.370
Hey, creep.

12:05.370 --> 12:08.390
The author says you're a liar.

12:08.390 --> 12:11.080
Katie's make believe.

12:11.080 --> 12:14.663
Write to me again, I'm
calling my uncle at the FBI.

12:17.940 --> 12:18.783
You're welcome.

12:21.118 --> 12:22.060
(crickets chirping)

12:22.060 --> 12:25.250
- [Katie Voiceover] Okay,
butt head, here's the story.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.280
I met the author at a book signing,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.090
he clearly wanted to bone me,

12:29.090 --> 12:32.200
so I sent him the link to my blog archive.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.580
He loved it, he thought the way I ended it

12:34.580 --> 12:38.620
using my mom's voice to say
I disappeared was genius.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.610
He offered to help me re-write it and get

12:40.610 --> 12:42.740
it published as a novel.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.800
I told him no way, but
if he wanted to do it

12:44.800 --> 12:46.650
we could split the money.

12:46.650 --> 12:49.790
Only he'd have to promise never
to tell anyone I was real.

12:49.790 --> 12:51.860
And that's why he lied to you.

12:51.860 --> 12:52.693
You see?

12:57.076 --> 13:00.109
(glass clinking)
(haunting music)

13:11.093 --> 13:14.190
(footsteps tapping)

13:14.190 --> 13:17.190
(suspenseful music)

13:23.538 --> 13:25.022
(Elle sighs)

13:28.525 --> 13:31.302
(crickets chirping)

13:31.302 --> 13:32.135
(door thuds)
What?

13:32.135 --> 13:34.020
You actually don't believe me?

13:34.020 --> 13:35.980
You really think I made it all up?

13:35.980 --> 13:37.833
Dude, why would I even do that?

13:39.700 --> 13:42.567
- Men do all kinds of
sick shit for no reason.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.208
(light clicks)

13:47.100 --> 13:49.410
- Either you're a Christian or you're not.

13:49.410 --> 13:51.380
Clearly she's not, otherwise she wouldn't

13:51.380 --> 13:52.393
have married a Jew.

13:54.430 --> 13:55.623
At least not that one.

13:56.540 --> 13:58.540
Do you know he didn't
even give little Olivia

13:58.540 --> 14:00.030
a choice about the bar mitzvah?

14:00.030 --> 14:01.280
Can you imagine?

14:01.280 --> 14:04.400
- Bat, not bar.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.710
- [Mom] I don't care if he did adopt her,

14:05.710 --> 14:08.090
it doesn't give him the

27:58.648 --> 27:59.720
- [Elle Voiceover] When
my mom found out Connor

27:59.720 --> 28:01.673
took me in, she called him Judas.

28:02.990 --> 28:06.313
If she'd known he was gay,
she would've hired a hitman.

28:07.340 --> 28:08.910
- I don't get Joan Crawford.

28:08.910 --> 28:11.686
Her shoulder pads were like condor wings.

28:11.686 --> 28:13.219
(both chuckling)

28:16.625 --> 28:19.125
(light music)

28:40.720 --> 28:41.850
- Hi.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.680
Molly Andrews, such a
pleasure to meet you, Elle.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.270
- Thank you, same here.

28:46.270 --> 28:48.260
- Did Sage offer you something to drink?

28:48.260 --> 28:51.270
Diet soda, coffee, coconut water?

28:51.270 --> 28:53.310
- I'm fine, thanks.

28:53.310 --> 28:54.153
- Come in.

28:59.355 --> 29:00.820
(both sighing)

29:00.820 --> 29:02.683
Welcome to En Garde Creative.

29:03.820 --> 29:06.060
- Thanks, I'm so grateful to be here.

29:06.060 --> 29:07.180
Even just-
- Your brother thinks

29:07.180 --> 29:09.210
the world of you and my boss thinks

29:09.210 --> 29:10.423
the world of your brother, so-

29:10.423 --> 29:12.750
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.250
How much do you know about us?

29:16.280 --> 29:18.730
- Well, just what's on the website,

29:18.730 --> 29:20.933
but I wanna know everything.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.840
- Well, we're small, but growing.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.380
Our work is exclusively digital,

29:26.380 --> 29:28.250
marketing directly via email, text,

29:28.250 --> 29:30.670
social media, and search engines.

29:30.670 --> 29:33.520
Right now all of our clients are domestic,

29:33.520 --> 29:35.200
located west of the Mississippi,

29:35.200 --> 29:37.260
but we are starting to
attract some interest

29:37.260 --> 29:40.173
in the Pacific rim as well, so who knows.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.970
- Wow, really exciting.

29:43.970 --> 29:44.803
- It is.

29:45.675 --> 29:46.775
Now tell me about you.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.290
- Well, um, I was blown
away when Connor told

29:52.290 --> 29:55.680
me about the job because
in college I majored

29:55.680 --> 29:59.223
in marketing with a special
focus on interactive media.

30:00.588 --> 30:03.480
I actually left because
I just felt like...

30:03.480 --> 30:06.570
I felt trapped in the
classroom setting, you know,

30:06.570 --> 30:08.590
it just felt theoretical.

30:08.590 --> 30:11.980
Like it was sort of just
like I really wanted

30:11.980 --> 30:13.980
some real world experien...

30:17.280 --> 30:21.310
Oh, I got bit by a dog.

30:21.310 --> 30:22.143
- What kind?

30:23.870 --> 30:24.703
- A beagle.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.820
- I had one as a kid.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.210
It got run over right in front of me,

30:30.210 --> 30:31.993
I still haven't recovered.

30:33.066 --> 30:34.200
- Oh.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.033
- Dave Hastings.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.750
Welcome aboard, Connor's sister.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.470
- Wait, you mean, I-

30:42.470 --> 30:43.303
- That's right.

30:45.374 --> 30:47.436
(Molly chuckles)

30:48.794 --> 30:50.630
We're over here.

30:50.630 --> 30:51.480
Go ahead, hop on.

30:52.930 --> 30:55.350
- [Elle] (giggles) Okay.

30:56.450 --> 30:58.110
- You might want to check
underneath first, though.

30:58.110 --> 31:00.640
Your predecessor stuck
her chewed gum down there.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.200
That's why I fired her.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.817
- Wait, really?

31:03.817 --> 31:05.313
- No, I dreamed her paltry.

31:06.960 --> 31:07.920
- Oh.

31:07.920 --> 31:09.220
- So, let's talk business.

31:11.040 --> 31:12.580
What did Connor say about me?

31:12.580 --> 31:16.150
- That you are charismatic,
brilliant and funny.

31:16.150 --> 31:18.040
- He didn't mention humble?

31:18.040 --> 31:19.292
- No.
- That's weird.

31:19.292 --> 31:20.934
(Elle laughs)

31:24.440 --> 31:27.400
- So, tell me more about the gum chewer.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.070
- Because you don't wanna
make the same mistakes?

31:30.070 --> 31:32.250
- Yeah, I wanna make new ones.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.910
- She was just too passive.

31:33.910 --> 31:36.400
If there's a way for the
office to run more efficiently,

31:36.400 --> 31:37.550
I wanna know about it.

31:37.550 --> 31:38.700
If there's something in my blind spot

31:38.700 --> 31:40.280
I need you to scream, "Watch out".

31:40.280 --> 31:42.910
Maybe you have a concept
for one of our campaigns,

31:42.910 --> 31:44.720
it doesn't matter if it's
above your pay grade,

31:44.720 --> 31:45.563
I wanna hear it.

32:49.971 --> 32:50.804
(lips smacking)

32:50.804 --> 32:52.090
My new assistant, Elle Overton.

32:52.090 --> 32:52.923
My wife Carmen.

32:52.923 --> 32:55.680
- [Carmen] Hi, I've
heard so much about you.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.710
- Same here.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.160
- So, Elle just had a great idea about

32:58.160 --> 32:59.040
the Eye Candy account.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.830
You know those eye test charts?

33:00.830 --> 33:02.760
She thought it would be fun
to post a chart each week,

33:02.760 --> 33:05.530
but hidden inside the jumble
of letters is a promo code.

33:05.530 --> 33:06.770
- Baby, will you tell me in the car?

33:06.770 --> 33:08.450
We're gonna be late.

33:08.450 --> 33:09.823
- Shit, I lost track.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.640
Can you close up?

33:12.640 --> 33:13.473
- Yeah.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.313
- Oh.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.850
Hey, you wanna make extra money?

33:19.850 --> 33:20.960
- [Elle] Uh, who doesn't?

33:20.960 --> 33:22.820
- We need a babysitter.

33:22.820 --> 33:23.653
- Oh.

33:24.590 --> 33:26.450
You have kids, wow.

33:26.450 --> 33:27.550
Yeah, I would love to.

33:29.430 --> 33:31.712
I have a lot of experience.

33:31.712 --> 33:32.545
- Perfect.

33:35.780 --> 33:39.030
(light dramatic music)

33:41.742 --> 33:43.070
- [Elle Voiceover] I know
what you're thinking,

33:43.070 --> 33:46.270
it was just like when you
were hired to be a nanny.

33:46.270 --> 33:47.870
But there was a huge difference.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.183
You were way hotter than the mom.

33:52.940 --> 33:54.703
I was a boy compared to Carmen.

34:02.630 --> 34:03.770
- Perfect timing.

34:03.770 --> 34:06.340
Three minutes after
brewing the antioxidants

34:06.340 --> 34:07.830
start to evaporate.

34:07.830 --> 34:10.659
- Is that Facebook or actual science?

34:10.659 --> 34:12.283
- It's actual Twitter.

34:14.643 --> 34:16.514
(Dave groans)

34:16.514 --> 34:17.810
Rough night?

34:17.810 --> 34:19.080
- [Dave] Yeah, the roughest.

34:19.080 --> 34:19.913
- What happened?

34:21.889 --> 34:24.800
- Went to a cocktail party
sponsored by a tequila company.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.600
I behaved, Carmen didn't.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.620
She, uh...

34:29.659 --> 34:30.780
Oh, she'd kill me.

34:30.780 --> 34:32.710
- Well, I won't tell anyone.

34:32.710 --> 34:33.543
I promise.

34:36.402 --> 34:37.632
(Dave sighs)

34:39.040 --> 34:41.300
- When I met Carmen she
was just a few years

34:41.300 --> 34:44.850
out of college, I mean, still
pretty much a party girl.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.588
She said she was sick of it,

34:46.588 --> 34:50.650
she wanted a husband, four kids,
and start her own business.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.670
I mean, that sounded great to me.

34:52.670 --> 34:54.793
So we got married, Esme was born,

34:55.951 --> 34:58.170
and out of nowhere she announces

34:58.170 --> 34:59.670
she doesn't want anymore kids.

35:00.740 --> 35:02.040
Well, that was a surprise.

35:04.840 --> 35:08.530
When I started En Garde I
assumed she'd get involved,

35:08.530 --> 35:13.530
help us out, but she doesn't give a shit.

35:13.580 --> 35:15.110
I mean, she wants it
to succeed, of course,

35:15.110 --> 35:17.520
for financial reasons, but that's it.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.240
- So if she doesn't want anymore kids

35:19.240 --> 35:20.653
and she doesn't care about the business,

35:20.653 --> 35:22.630
then what makes her happy?

35:22.630 --> 35:23.463
- Shopping.

35:24.563 --> 35:25.970
- Oh.

35:25.970 --> 35:27.570
- A few nights a week she
still goes out partying

35:27.570 --> 35:28.980
with her old college friends.

35:28.980 --> 35:31.020
- So she's not over it.

35:31.020 --> 35:32.430
- Looks that way.

35:32.430 --> 35:35.055
Anyway, last night she, uh...

35:35.055 --> 35:37.560
(sighs) Man, this is so inappropriate.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.463
- Oh, my favorite.

35:40.620 --> 35:41.713
- She puked up on me.

35:43.030 --> 35:44.060
- Wait, literally?

35:44.060 --> 35:46.573
- No, trust me, it was no metaphor.

35:46.573 --> 35:48.147
- How does that even happen?

35:48.147 --> 35:50.160
- I don't know, I was fast asleep.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.998
I assumed she'd just staggered
in from the loo and blah.

35:52.998 --> 35:54.260
- Oh, my God.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.650
- I woke up drenched in puke,

35:55.650 --> 35:56.960
she was passed out on the floor.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.890
I had to take her to the guest bedroom.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.170
By the time I finished cleaning up

36:00.170 --> 36:02.650
Esme was awake demanding breakfast, so...

36:04.720 --> 36:05.830
Yeah.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.723
- Oh, you poor thing.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.563
- You know, it's nice
to have someone pity me.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.727
Other than myself, of course.

36:20.727 --> 36:22.144
(Elle chuckles)

36:25.787 --> 36:26.950
(crickets chirping)

36:26.950 --> 36:29.276
- [Katie Voiceover] Your emails
are like my favorite novel.

36:34.190 --> 36:36.473
Oh no, you're depressed again.

36:42.059 --> 36:44.703
(birds chirping)

36:44.703 --> 36:46.220
Are you bleeding, too?

36:46.220 --> 36:47.053
I am.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.350
I wonder if our cycles are in sync.

36:50.350 --> 36:52.617
You know, like roomies.

36:52.617 --> 36:54.450
(light music)

36:54.450 --> 36:55.870
- [Female Reader] I loved your book until

36:55.870 --> 36:58.670
I found out it was written
by a middle-aged man.

36:58.670 --> 37:01.040
For to your appropriate the heart, soul,

37:01.040 --> 37:04.663
and body of a young girl
is absolutely disgusting.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.196
- [Katie Voiceover] What do
you eat when you're bleeding?

37:12.690 --> 37:15.093
I just ate an entire bag of kettle corn.

37:20.425 --> 37:21.700
(crickets chirping)

37:21.700 --> 37:24.130
Telling your story will save your life.

37:24.130 --> 37:25.510
I promise.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.223
It definitely saved mine.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.270
I know how to wake you up.

37:32.270 --> 37:35.170
I'll tell you something
about myself you don't know.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.003
Let me see.

37:39.070 --> 37:41.680
Okay, how's this?

37:41.680 --> 37:42.603
I'm married.

37:48.130 --> 37:48.963
- Seriously?

37:50.640 --> 37:52.153
- [Katie Voiceover] We have a baby.

38:00.235 --> 38:01.955
- I thought you got an abortion.

38:02.930 --> 38:05.655
- [Katie Voiceover] I did, my
daughter was conceived later.

38:07.150 --> 38:07.983
The right way.

38:08.950 --> 38:11.050
With someone who loves me unconditionally.

38:17.630 --> 38:19.123
- I want that so badly.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.100
- [Katie Voiceover] You'll have it,

38:23.100 --> 38:25.600
and you'll love your baby
as much as I love Sarah.

38:29.730 --> 38:30.563
- Sarah.

38:32.760 --> 38:33.943
That's my middle name.

38:36.330 --> 38:37.423
- [Katie Voiceover] Cool.

38:39.490 --> 38:41.240
Now, please get back to your story.

38:44.590 --> 38:45.963
- Why do you even care?

38:47.480 --> 38:49.083
- [Katie Voiceover] We're friends.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.593
- Strangers.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.153
- [Katie Voiceover] We're both.

38:58.820 --> 39:00.420
- It shouldn't even be possible.

39:04.102 --> 39:05.803
(game clinking)
Good job.

39:08.730 --> 39:10.263
- [Carmen] This one or this one?

39:12.080 --> 39:15.803
- Um, it's so hard to choose.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.890
- Which one goes better with vampire red?

39:23.220 --> 39:24.740
- The black one.

39:24.740 --> 39:25.971
- You're right.

39:25.971 --> 39:27.033
(Elle chuckles)

39:27.900 --> 39:30.430
- Miss Elle, you have pretty lips.

39:30.430 --> 39:31.615
- Thank you.

39:31.615 --> 39:32.448
You, too.

39:35.430 --> 39:37.970
So Dave says you wanna
start your own business.

39:37.970 --> 39:39.710
- [Carmen] Definitely.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.027
- Well we could use some
help over at the office.

39:43.030 --> 39:45.310
How come you don't drop by more often?

39:45.310 --> 39:46.830
- You'll understand when you have kids.

39:46.830 --> 39:49.790
This little bug kicks my butt
all day, don't you, bonita?

39:49.790 --> 39:51.560
- Except when I'm at Rainbow.

39:51.560 --> 39:52.440
- [Elle] What's that?

39:52.440 --> 39:53.600
- Her preschool.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.410
- After Rainbow Rosalinda
comes over, she's my nanny.

39:57.410 --> 40:00.850
- But there are some things
only a mommy can do, right baby?

40:00.850 --> 40:03.200
- Rosalinda plays hide
and seek and monsters

40:03.200 --> 40:05.040
and we build pillow forts.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.670
- Mommy takes you to movies
and yummy restaurants

40:07.670 --> 40:09.750
and buys you pretty dresses.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.209
- Mommy, can Miss Elle
take a bath with me?

40:12.209 --> 40:13.647
(both laughing)

40:15.630 --> 40:17.380
- [Dave] No, I know.

40:17.380 --> 40:19.680
I'm not sure, as quick
as I can darling, okay?

40:21.130 --> 40:22.191
Bye.

40:22.191 --> 40:23.491
(phone clatters)

40:26.415 --> 40:28.023
- This is my favorite.

40:28.023 --> 40:29.287
(mouse clicks)

40:30.362 --> 40:32.003
What do you think of him?

40:32.003 --> 40:33.586
- [Dave] Brilliant.

40:35.730 --> 40:37.970
- [Elle] If you're ever looking
for a present for Carmen.

40:37.970 --> 40:39.177
- [Dave] The bikini or the girl?

40:39.177 --> 40:41.030
- The bikini.

40:41.030 --> 40:42.230
It's right up her alley.

40:42.230 --> 40:43.883
- [Carmen] It is exactly
why'd she wear it.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.760
- I would too if I had her body.

40:52.410 --> 40:57.100
Her closet is like
backstage at Fashion Week,

40:57.100 --> 40:58.343
I mean, it's insane.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.580
How do you afford it?

41:00.580 --> 41:02.040
- I don't.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.198
I can't.

41:03.198 --> 41:06.040
She blows through my
trust like play money.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.523
Each month we barely make
it to the finish line.

41:09.459 --> 41:10.726
(Dave sighs)

41:16.560 --> 41:18.850
- I am gonna email the photographer

41:18.850 --> 41:22.131
and see if he is available.

41:22.131 --> 41:23.790
(mouse clicks)

41:23.790 --> 41:25.490
(keyboard clicking)

41:31.930 --> 41:33.630
Can I ask you a personal question?

41:35.290 --> 41:36.290
- Why'd I marry her?

41:42.130 --> 41:42.963
(Dave sighs)

41:42.963 --> 41:44.503
Honestly, we had fun at first.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.050
Went to the gym together, we went hiking.

41:50.071 --> 41:51.870
We traveled loads.

41:51.870 --> 41:54.793
Nonstop shagging, our
chemistry was incredible.

41:57.430 --> 41:59.493
Once Esme was born all the fun stopped.

42:03.960 --> 42:04.913
- No more sex?

42:06.280 --> 42:07.830
- On the once-a-month plan now.

42:10.290 --> 42:12.140
Such a cliche.

42:12.140 --> 42:14.190
Even a blind man could've seen it coming.

42:16.890 --> 42:20.203
Marry for conversation, it's
the only thing that lasts.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.182
(crickets chirping)

42:30.540 --> 42:31.593
- So, Mom called.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.423
Welcome back.

42:37.450 --> 42:39.130
- What'd she say?

42:39.130 --> 42:43.943
- I'm still disowned,
still Judas, but not you.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.220
She said that even though she'd preferred

42:47.220 --> 42:49.230
if you went back and finished at State,

42:49.230 --> 42:52.990
she is fine with you going
to any school you want.

42:52.990 --> 42:54.390
Even art school.

42:54.390 --> 42:56.673
She'll pay for it, too,
no questions asked.

42:57.511 --> 42:58.900
- Wait, really?

42:58.900 --> 43:00.110
- Yeah, yeah.

43:00.110 --> 43:02.210
I'm pretty sure it's the first time

43:02.210 --> 43:03.890
she's surrendered to
anyone since she spread

43:03.890 --> 43:05.540
her legs for our lord and savior.

43:08.330 --> 43:09.220
What's the matter? You won.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.720
You're supposed to be happier.

43:14.340 --> 43:15.940
Oh, shit, you don't wanna leave.

43:18.770 --> 43:19.603
What's his name?

43:23.690 --> 43:24.740
- You don't know him.

43:26.120 --> 43:28.520
Besides, it doesn't matter,
he's got a girlfriend.

43:30.599 --> 43:31.432
(Elle sighs)

43:31.432 --> 43:32.560
- [Connor] Is he into you?

43:35.332 --> 43:36.165
- No.

43:38.863 --> 43:40.679
I don't know, maybe.

43:40.679 --> 43:41.512
Maybe.

43:47.460 --> 43:51.130
- [Connor] Listen, any guy that you like

43:51.130 --> 43:54.035
who's unavailable, isn't a guy.

43:55.220 --> 43:56.093
He's a drug.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.143
And not like a drug, an actual one.

44:00.020 --> 44:03.130
And way back in the 80s, what
did the scary skeletor lady

44:03.130 --> 44:05.756
in the White House tell us to
do when we get offered drugs?

44:06.714 --> 44:08.700
- I don't know.

44:08.700 --> 44:09.850
- [Connor] Just say no.

44:11.010 --> 44:12.423
- Did anyone listen to her?

44:14.598 --> 44:16.395
- Of course not.

44:16.395 --> 44:17.558
(crickets chirping)

44:17.558 --> 44:19.690
- [Elle Voiceover] I should've
phoned home the next day.

44:19.690 --> 44:21.343
It was the perfect time to leave.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.010
- [Katie Voiceover] But you thought Dave

44:26.010 --> 44:29.143
was your destiny, didn't you?

44:34.489 --> 44:38.405

44:38.405 --> 44:41.074

44:47.111 --> 44:48.396
Happy birthday.

44:48.396 --> 44:49.396
- Thank you.

44:51.906 --> 44:52.739
- Hey.

44:54.710 --> 44:55.970
- Where's Carmen?

44:55.970 --> 44:57.020
- Already passed out.

44:58.220 --> 44:59.053
- You slip her a roofie?

44:59.053 --> 45:01.388
- Yeah, but I didn't take advantage.

45:01.388 --> 45:03.800
I heard there was cake.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.652
- Yeah, she saved you some.

45:05.652 --> 45:06.819
- Yeah? Where?

45:07.808 --> 45:09.083
- In the kitchen.

45:12.232 --> 45:13.264
What?

45:13.264 --> 45:15.319
- [Dave] I'm just happy
to see you, is all.

45:15.319 --> 45:16.950
You drunk?

45:16.950 --> 45:18.200
- Yeah.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.033
Are you?

45:20.664 --> 45:21.497
Stoned?

45:23.148 --> 45:24.898

46:33.192 --> 46:35.142
(crickets chirping)

46:37.180 --> 46:40.633
- Dave and I continued on
like everything was normal.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.950
But then a week later we
were at the office late

46:47.560 --> 46:48.923
and he kissed me again.

46:51.990 --> 46:56.810
This time he was sober
and I didn't run away.

47:00.210 --> 47:02.100
If I had been a cartoon,

47:02.100 --> 47:04.075
my tongue would've popped out of his ear.

47:08.799 --> 47:11.549
Then, finally, he pushed me away.

47:15.520 --> 47:19.447
He said, "I'm so sorry,
but I can't do this."

47:21.130 --> 47:22.453
He was a married man.

47:24.270 --> 47:25.123
I laughed.

47:26.370 --> 47:28.900
Like, what, like I didn't know that?

47:28.900 --> 47:30.323
But I thought he was joking.

47:32.050 --> 47:36.530
And he said it like I was
the one who kissed him.

47:38.340 --> 47:39.293
It was nuts.

47:41.860 --> 47:43.133
But I didn't freak out.

47:44.480 --> 47:48.809
Just shrugged it off and said,
"You're right, whatever".

47:52.710 --> 47:55.000
Well, I must've been a pretty good actress

47:56.295 --> 47:59.948
because he actually looked
hurt that I wasn't that upset.

48:03.674 --> 48:05.524
But then he started kissing me again,

48:06.980 --> 48:08.823
but this time it was more intense.

48:11.420 --> 48:15.533
He started grabbing my ass,
my boobs outside of my shirt.

48:18.100 --> 48:23.100
And then he got on his
knees, lifted my skirt up,

48:23.610 --> 48:28.308
pulled my underwear down
and started licking me.

48:31.678 --> 48:33.113
It was so fucking dirty.

48:35.827 --> 48:38.452
It's the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

48:42.450 --> 48:44.350
My eyes were open the whole time

48:46.255 --> 48:49.293
and I just kept imagining
somebody walking in on us.

48:52.180 --> 48:53.533
I came so hard.

48:58.070 --> 49:00.430
Then about 10 seconds later he said,

49:06.017 --> 49:09.755
"Shit, I'm late to meet Carmen".

49:11.520 --> 49:14.848
He got up, door slammed,

49:18.010 --> 49:18.843
and he's gone.

49:22.503 --> 49:23.336
And I...

49:27.654 --> 49:28.804
(Elle sighs)

49:32.110 --> 49:34.163
- [Katie Voiceover] What
he did to you was rape.

49:35.490 --> 49:37.493
Not literally, because you enjoyed it,

49:38.860 --> 49:41.228
but emotional and psychological violence.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.733
- [Elle Voiceover] How did
you get to be so strong?

49:47.860 --> 49:49.940
- [Katie Voiceover] I'm
not a teenager anymore.

49:49.940 --> 49:52.660
I understand the evil of human beings,

49:52.660 --> 49:54.963
especially those cursed with nut sacks.

49:56.380 --> 49:58.530
- [Elle Voiceover] On
Sunday nights, if I watch

49:58.530 --> 50:00.890
a corny Christian movie with my mom

50:00.890 --> 50:02.515
she lets me borrow her car.

50:02.515 --> 50:04.073
(light music)
(phone buzzing)

50:12.000 --> 50:14.060
- [Katie Voiceover] My
husband's name is Kevin.

50:14.060 --> 50:15.993
He's tall, dark and handsome.

50:17.110 --> 50:20.593
He used to be a Marine, now
he sells medical equipment.

50:23.390 --> 50:25.920
I stay home all day
with Sarah, she's three,

50:25.920 --> 50:28.833
beyond precious, the
best thing I ever did.

50:31.210 --> 50:32.390
- How come you say you wanna meet me

50:32.390 --> 50:35.660
but you never suggest that
we like talk on the phone?

50:35.660 --> 50:37.693
You never even ask if we can text.

50:40.630 --> 50:42.392
That's just weird.

50:42.392 --> 50:43.225
(water pattering)

50:43.225 --> 50:45.110
- [Katie Voiceover]
Kevin's a jealous freak.

50:45.110 --> 50:46.500
If we called or texted each other,

50:46.500 --> 50:49.720
sooner or later he'd snoop
in my phone and bust me.

50:49.720 --> 50:52.000
That's why I only get
fan mail on my laptop

50:52.000 --> 50:55.120
and I delete everything
the second after I read it.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.140
- [Elle Voiceover] Bust you for what?

50:57.140 --> 50:58.223
Having a friend?

50:59.080 --> 51:01.300
Is that an actual crime?

51:01.300 --> 51:03.140
- [Katie Voiceover]
No, but we have a deal.

51:03.140 --> 51:04.720
No secrets.

51:04.720 --> 51:07.583
If I told him about you I'd
have to tell him how we met.

51:08.490 --> 51:13.307
He knows nothing about my blog,
my book, what a slut I was.

51:15.060 --> 51:16.763
If he knew he would go insane.

51:20.410 --> 51:21.720
- [Elle Voiceover] Fine, I get it.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.103
We'll keep things the way they are.

51:24.380 --> 51:25.213
Where was I?

51:26.150 --> 51:29.030
Right, you won't believe this.

51:29.030 --> 51:31.960
But after he went down on
me, he put me right back

51:31.960 --> 51:34.453
in the friend zone like it never happened.

51:35.750 --> 51:39.423
- Being insane, I decided it
was because it grossed him out.

51:40.881 --> 51:43.389
Like there was something wrong with me.

51:43.389 --> 51:46.270
(light music)

51:46.270 --> 51:49.320
- [Female Reader] Katie,
I just finished reading.

51:49.320 --> 51:52.970
You've probably been chopped
into itty bitty pieces by now,

51:52.970 --> 51:55.800
but it's just as possible
a miracle occurred.

51:55.800 --> 51:59.730
I'm an aquarius, we're all about miracles.

51:59.730 --> 52:01.970
So I choose to believe you're out there

52:01.970 --> 52:03.705
having an awesome life.

52:08.168 --> 52:10.668
(door clicks)

52:12.500 --> 52:13.333
- Hello?

52:16.854 --> 52:17.690
(Elle sighs)

52:17.690 --> 52:19.400
- [Dave] It's just me.

52:19.400 --> 52:21.090
- I thought you weren't
gonna be back until tomorrow.

52:22.264 --> 52:23.970
- I managed to escape early.

52:23.970 --> 52:24.903
What are you still doing here?

52:24.903 --> 52:26.161
Don't you have your own desk?

52:27.580 --> 52:30.830
- I'm just seeing beyond
my job description.

52:30.830 --> 52:32.630
Working on some ideas.

52:32.630 --> 52:33.543
- You have pluck.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.243
- Well, you noticed.

52:38.945 --> 52:40.890
(Dave sighs)

52:40.890 --> 52:43.880
- What a waste of time, the whole trip.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.250
Who ever the Japanese were polite?

52:46.250 --> 52:48.860
- Someone who's never
heard of Pearl Harbor.

52:48.860 --> 52:50.190
- Well, at least that
was over pretty quick.

52:50.190 --> 52:52.090
This was more like the Bataan Death March

52:52.090 --> 52:54.574
with an order of cold uni.

52:54.574 --> 52:56.730
(Elle groans)

52:56.730 --> 52:57.580
You want a drink?

52:58.510 --> 53:01.210
- If it'll wash the taste
of uni out of my mind, yeah.

53:02.270 --> 53:05.293
- Fun fact, uni isn't the actual urchin.

53:06.440 --> 53:08.590
It's the urchin's gonads.

53:08.590 --> 53:09.653
- Make that a double.

53:14.366 --> 53:15.725
(Dave sighs)

53:19.113 --> 53:19.946
Thank you.

53:20.852 --> 53:22.219
(glasses clinking)

53:27.653 --> 53:29.113
- [Dave] So, how've you been?

53:32.640 --> 53:33.473
- Honestly?

53:36.047 --> 53:37.272
(Elle chuckles)

53:41.840 --> 53:42.673
- Come here.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.182
Tell me everything.

54:04.343 --> 54:06.201
(light dramatic music)

54:09.461 --> 54:11.494
What did you...

54:11.494 --> 54:13.577
- It's manicure scissors.

54:17.520 --> 54:18.353
- Is that my fault?

54:18.353 --> 54:19.186
- No.

54:19.186 --> 54:20.019
No, no, no, no, no.

54:20.019 --> 54:20.852
I um...

54:23.015 --> 54:24.765
Been doing it for years on and off.

54:26.819 --> 54:29.920
It's just whenever I get
overwhelmed by a situation

54:31.860 --> 54:35.530
or I feel like-

54:35.530 --> 54:38.140
- You wouldn't feel overwhelmed if I had

54:38.140 --> 54:40.313
the courage to admit that
I was in love with you.

54:42.991 --> 54:43.919
(Elle gasps)

54:45.519 --> 54:48.019

(phone clicks)

55:55.199 --> 55:56.815
(crickets chirping)

55:57.790 --> 56:00.330
- [Katie Voiceover] Okay,
three crucial questions

56:00.330 --> 56:02.010
after a night of boneage.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.310
How big was his dick?

56:06.310 --> 56:07.783
Did you go down on him?

56:08.660 --> 56:09.513
Did you cum?

56:10.766 --> 56:14.060
(light music)
(crickets chirping)

56:14.060 --> 56:16.393
Waiting for my answers.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.710
I'm watching "True Crime" on TV.

56:20.710 --> 56:22.510
Did you know the leading cause of homicide

56:22.510 --> 56:25.610
in women is having a smile
that lights up the room?

56:25.610 --> 56:28.237
In men it's giving friends
the shirt off your back.

56:28.237 --> 56:29.770
(Katie laughs)

56:29.770 --> 56:30.713
It's true!

56:31.700 --> 56:34.800
Last week a girl disappeared
a few miles from here.

56:34.800 --> 56:38.060
Stella something-Polish.

56:38.060 --> 56:39.600
Did you read about it?

56:39.600 --> 56:43.586
They found her body this
morning floating in a reservoir.

56:45.040 --> 56:45.873
Yuck.

56:47.040 --> 56:47.873
Hello?

56:48.760 --> 56:49.673
Where are you?

56:50.810 --> 56:51.643
Are you dead?

56:52.621 --> 56:54.388
(crickets chirping)

56:58.660 --> 57:01.423
- Sorry about last night,
I had a sugar crash.

57:02.870 --> 57:04.810
How do you stay up so late and raise

57:04.810 --> 57:06.080
a kid at the same time?

57:06.080 --> 57:08.040
- [Katie Voiceover] I have a
nanny five mornings a week.

57:08.040 --> 57:10.200
I'm as lazy as Carmen.

57:10.200 --> 57:11.893
Hey, maybe I am Carmen.

57:12.760 --> 57:14.043
Ew, creepy.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.350
- Not funny if true.

57:16.350 --> 57:18.630
- [Katie Voiceover] Dude, it was a joke.

57:18.630 --> 57:21.235
I have real boobs and hate spicy food.

57:22.380 --> 57:24.710
Now stop being such a paranoid loser

57:24.710 --> 57:26.010
and tell me what happened.

57:27.921 --> 57:29.420
(Dave sighs)

57:29.420 --> 57:30.420
- You smell so good.

57:32.270 --> 57:33.490
You feel so good.

57:35.721 --> 57:36.888
Taste so good.

57:39.692 --> 57:41.450
You're perfect, you know that?

57:46.553 --> 57:49.023
I wanna crawl inside
you and never come out.

57:52.978 --> 57:53.811
- Okay.

57:59.821 --> 58:02.210
(toothbrush rustling)

58:02.210 --> 58:04.010
Here's something I don't get.

58:04.010 --> 58:05.360
If you and Carmen fight all the time

58:05.360 --> 58:07.560
then how does you staying
married help Esme?

58:12.290 --> 58:14.350
Wouldn't it be better to get divorced now

58:15.320 --> 58:16.920
before you mess her up for life?

58:18.180 --> 58:19.320
- It's an excellent question.

58:19.320 --> 58:21.321
- Yes, I'm aware of that.

58:21.321 --> 58:23.747
(phone clicks)
(Elle giggles)

58:23.747 --> 58:24.930
(Elle grunts)

58:24.930 --> 58:26.680
- I wish I had an excellent answer.

58:29.620 --> 58:31.261
(phone clicks)

58:34.161 --> 58:38.230
- You know, I'm not asking
for myself, I promise.

58:38.230 --> 58:41.623
I just want you to be
happy, and Esme, too.

58:42.469 --> 58:43.703
- What about Carmen?

58:44.853 --> 58:46.185
- She can suffer.

58:46.185 --> 58:47.652
(both laughing)

58:50.056 --> 58:51.423
(Dave sighs)

58:54.090 --> 58:55.660
- Okay.

58:55.660 --> 59:00.160
The real reason I don't divorce
her is quite humiliating.

59:01.449 --> 59:02.500
- For who?

59:02.500 --> 59:03.840
- Whom?

59:03.840 --> 59:04.673
For me.

59:09.780 --> 59:12.660
If we get divorced she'll
take half of everything,

59:12.660 --> 59:14.323
which means En Garde goes under.

59:18.850 --> 59:20.860
- So you care more about your business

59:20.860 --> 59:22.143
than your own happiness?

59:23.400 --> 59:24.233
- Honestly?

59:25.090 --> 59:25.923
I...

59:27.910 --> 59:29.260
I doubt I'll ever be happy.

59:30.170 --> 59:31.620
Not in this lifetime, anyway.

59:32.990 --> 59:36.473
I want to be secure, own
a business I'm proud of.

59:43.730 --> 59:45.572
(phone dings)

59:54.690 --> 59:57.453
- [Elle Voiceover] The
letter U instead Y-O-U.

59:58.370 --> 1:00:00.370
No question mark.

1:00:00.370 --> 1:00:02.010
But the weirdest thing was that Dave

1:00:02.010 --> 1:00:05.548
would never say fucking,
always making love.

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:13.840
- [Katie Voiceover] Oh no,
the bitch stole his phone.

1:00:15.027 --> 1:00:16.080
(light dramatic music)

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:18.133
- [Elle Voiceover] 100%, I knew it.

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:23.540
- [Katie Voiceover] It was a trap.

1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:24.863
- [Elle Voiceover] Definitely.

1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:29.323
But maybe also a gift.

1:00:33.160 --> 1:00:35.170
An opportunity.

1:00:35.170 --> 1:00:37.138
An open door in my jail cell.

1:00:38.570 --> 1:00:40.730
I might never get a chance like this again

1:00:40.730 --> 1:00:42.863
and no one could blame me for escaping.

1:00:43.960 --> 1:00:46.393
How was I supposed to know
the text wasn't from him?

1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:53.246
- I'm only happy when you're inside me.

1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:57.457
God, how I love you, David.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:03.210
Come over again tonight.

1:01:04.818 --> 1:01:06.718
- [Katie Voiceover] (laughs) Oh, shit.

1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:08.713
You're my hero.

1:01:16.191 --> 1:01:17.024
(Elle sighs)

1:01:17.024 --> 1:01:18.730
(phone ringing)

1:01:18.730 --> 1:01:19.580
- Hello?

1:01:19.580 --> 1:01:21.700
- [Dave] Did you just text me?

1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:24.170
- Well, I mean, I responded back to you.

1:01:24.170 --> 1:01:26.640
- [Dave] Shit, what did my text say?

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.060
- You don't remember?

1:01:28.060 --> 1:01:29.690
- [Dave] Quick, tell me.

1:01:29.690 --> 1:01:32.120
- You said that you loved
fucking me last night

1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:33.870
and that you wanted to do it again.

1:01:34.770 --> 1:01:35.820
I said tonight.

1:01:35.820 --> 1:01:37.460
- [Dave] No, no, Carmen wrote it.

1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:39.120
She stole my phone.

1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:41.400
I'm trying to talk my way out
of it, I'll call you later.

1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:43.455
- Don't, Dave.

1:01:43.455 --> 1:01:44.440
- [Dave] What?

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:47.270
- Listen to me, take care of your family.

1:01:47.270 --> 1:01:48.903
Forget about me, I mean it.

1:01:50.574 --> 1:01:51.407
I quit.

1:01:51.407 --> 1:01:52.240
- [Dave] What? No.

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:53.793

1:02:10.570 --> 1:02:12.571
- [Elle Voiceover] I was
so excited to move on

1:02:12.571 --> 1:02:13.960
(hand knocking)
that it never occurred

1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:16.112
to me that Connor would find out.

1:02:16.112 --> 1:02:18.340
(Connor sighs)

1:02:18.340 --> 1:02:19.973
- I'm sorry that I let you down.

1:02:24.319 --> 1:02:27.388
I kinda assumed that you'd
be a bit more pissed off.

1:02:29.780 --> 1:02:30.613
- Listen.

1:02:32.150 --> 1:02:33.603
Dave gets most of the blame.

1:02:36.330 --> 1:02:38.773
He's older, he's married.

1:02:39.950 --> 1:02:41.323
He was your employer.

1:02:43.130 --> 1:02:46.500
You know, if you wanna sue him my friend

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:47.644
would be happy to take the case.

1:02:47.644 --> 1:02:48.477
- No, no.

1:02:50.437 --> 1:02:51.883
He's a good guy.

1:02:53.420 --> 1:02:55.265
He's just really unhappy.

1:02:57.324 --> 1:02:58.157
And...

1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:01.990
It's on both of us.

1:03:01.990 --> 1:03:04.143
I could've prevented it.

1:03:08.630 --> 1:03:12.333
- Anyway, um, I know
somebody who will hire you.

1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:15.510
The pay is really shitty, but the uniform

1:03:15.510 --> 1:03:17.773
is really unflattering so
nobody will hit on you.

1:03:18.681 --> 1:03:19.739
(Elle laughs)

1:03:21.647 --> 1:03:23.196
- Thank you.

1:03:23.196 --> 1:03:24.482
(glasses clinking)

1:03:25.540 --> 1:03:27.250
- [Female Reader] Oh, Katie.

1:03:27.250 --> 1:03:30.923
So much pain seeing myself in your words.

1:03:32.300 --> 1:03:34.570
What I wouldn't give to reclaim just one

1:03:34.570 --> 1:03:36.260
tick tock of my youth.

1:03:39.279 --> 1:03:40.112
- [Elle Voiceover] It's
the first time you didn't

1:03:40.112 --> 1:03:41.743
write back after one of my emails.

1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:44.223
Did something happen?

1:03:46.070 --> 1:03:47.320
Finally had enough of me?

1:03:51.420 --> 1:03:52.973
- Ready for a little uplift?

1:04:00.790 --> 1:04:03.110
- [Pastor] And as views
of his miraculous power

1:04:03.110 --> 1:04:07.120
spread across the land
the people delivered

1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:10.943
unto our lord the cripple, the blind,

1:04:12.343 --> 1:04:16.693
those wracked by pain,
tormented by seizures,

1:04:18.367 --> 1:04:20.331
even those possessed by demons.

1:04:20.331 --> 1:04:22.798
(phone buzzes)
(light dramatic music)

1:04:25.433 --> 1:04:28.050
- [Katie Voiceover] Sorry I disappeared.

1:04:28.050 --> 1:04:30.970
Kevin walked up behind me
while I was on my computer,

1:04:30.970 --> 1:04:34.330
he asked who I was writing
to and I had no choice.

1:04:34.330 --> 1:04:35.380
I told him the truth.

1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:38.610
About you, about my book.

1:04:38.610 --> 1:04:39.683
He freaked out.

1:04:40.650 --> 1:04:42.540
He thinks the fact that
you won't meet me in person

1:04:42.540 --> 1:04:44.590
means you're a dude who wants to rape me.

1:04:46.130 --> 1:04:48.520
But even if he's wrong
he said he still hates

1:04:48.520 --> 1:04:50.420
your guts because I kept you a secret.

1:04:54.790 --> 1:04:58.210
Anyway, he made me promise
never to write you again.

1:04:58.210 --> 1:04:59.513
I lied and said okay.

1:05:01.070 --> 1:05:03.773
Like I'd ever let a man
control my existence.

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:05.880
He should know better.

1:05:07.650 --> 1:05:08.910
Go on with your story.

1:05:08.910 --> 1:05:10.934
Please tell me Dave was history.

1:05:10.934 --> 1:05:12.820
- [Man] The chosen will banish the demons,

1:05:12.820 --> 1:05:16.380
speak in new tongues,
bring the word of God

1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:18.323
to every corner of the earth.

1:05:21.660 --> 1:05:23.130
- [Elle Voiceover] I hoped so.

1:05:23.130 --> 1:05:25.460
I went to work every day and every day

1:05:25.460 --> 1:05:27.703
I missed him less and less.

1:05:30.916 --> 1:05:32.420
(door thuds)

1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:33.253
- Elle!

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.833
We should talk, right?

1:05:42.810 --> 1:05:45.650
Actually, we were all pretty jazzed Carmen

1:05:45.650 --> 1:05:46.890
finally busted him.

1:05:46.890 --> 1:05:49.430
- I thought that you all love Dave.

1:05:49.430 --> 1:05:53.850
- We do, we just hate that he
sleeps with his assistants.

1:05:53.850 --> 1:05:55.805
Hopefully that's over now.

1:05:55.805 --> 1:05:57.905
We can all finally look Carmen in the eye.

1:06:01.701 --> 1:06:02.534
Oh.

1:06:04.340 --> 1:06:07.226
You thought you were like the first one?

1:06:10.930 --> 1:06:11.763
No.

1:06:14.050 --> 1:06:14.883
- How...

1:06:16.090 --> 1:06:17.303
How many others?

1:06:19.730 --> 1:06:21.230
- [Molly] All of them, really.

1:06:22.330 --> 1:06:24.500
Except for the one that was born male.

1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:26.500
Dave didn't know that when he hired her.

1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:28.670
- What about the last one?

1:06:28.670 --> 1:06:30.300
The gum chewer?

1:06:30.300 --> 1:06:31.330
- Yeah.

1:06:31.330 --> 1:06:33.170
She got super attached.

1:06:33.170 --> 1:06:35.270
She went psycho and moved back to Florida.

1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:38.640
Hey, hey.

1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:39.563
Don't freak out.

1:06:41.030 --> 1:06:41.953
You won.

1:06:43.190 --> 1:06:45.920
You are young and gorgeous and you have

1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:47.453
your whole life ahead of you.

1:06:49.940 --> 1:06:52.650
He has to go straight home
to Carmen every night.

1:06:52.650 --> 1:06:54.890
He's not allowed to travel without her,

1:06:54.890 --> 1:06:57.410
she even picked out his new assistant.

1:06:57.410 --> 1:06:59.163
- Why doesn't she just divorce him?

1:07:00.030 --> 1:07:01.090
- Well, she probably would if she knew

1:07:01.090 --> 1:07:02.340
the truth about you guys.

1:07:03.460 --> 1:07:06.113
But he told Carmen you guys
only slept together once.

1:07:07.450 --> 1:07:09.850
He said he did it because
he felt sorry for you.

1:07:15.722 --> 1:07:16.970
(Elle sighs)

1:07:18.270 --> 1:07:19.743
- How do you know so much?

1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:25.423
- I'm smarter than Dave, so
he isn't attracted to me.

1:07:27.370 --> 1:07:29.620
But that also means he
tells me everything.

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:37.490
I'm sorry.
(door thuds)

1:07:38.390 --> 1:07:39.823
- Are you? Really?

1:07:42.990 --> 1:07:45.471
Why doesn't he just divorce her?

1:07:45.471 --> 1:07:46.790
I mean, is he really
so scared about losing

1:07:46.790 --> 1:07:47.690
half of his money?

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:50.720
- What do you mean?

1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:51.823
He loses all of it.

1:07:53.740 --> 1:07:55.090
He signed a prenup.

1:07:55.090 --> 1:07:57.580
If they get a divorce
he doesn't get a cent.

1:07:57.580 --> 1:07:59.385
- No, what about his trust?

1:08:01.370 --> 1:08:02.720
- Is that what he told you?

1:08:03.590 --> 1:08:07.283
No, she comes from one of the
richest families in El Paso.

1:08:09.020 --> 1:08:11.330
Her dad bankrolls the company.

1:08:11.330 --> 1:08:13.330
He even helped him get his green card.

1:08:13.330 --> 1:08:16.643
When she met him he was
literally selling used cars.

1:08:18.242 --> 1:08:20.425
(crickets chirping)
(light dramatic music)

1:08:23.469 --> 1:08:24.303
- Hey.

1:08:27.710 --> 1:08:29.227
What did Molly tell you?

1:08:29.227 --> 1:08:30.633
- Are you stalking me now?

1:08:33.260 --> 1:08:36.300
You know, I should be
angry at you for hiring me

1:08:36.300 --> 1:08:37.600
just so you could fuck me,

1:08:39.700 --> 1:08:42.569
but I'm so insane I'm weirdly flattered.

1:08:42.569 --> 1:08:46.513
But what I can't forgive
is what a liar you are.

1:08:47.819 --> 1:08:50.683
Carmen isn't a gold
digging whore, you are.

1:08:52.260 --> 1:08:53.452
You make me sick.

1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:56.960
- Stop, wait, please.

1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:58.260
Just let me say something.

1:08:59.210 --> 1:09:01.139
Look, no matter what happened before,

1:09:01.139 --> 1:09:02.523
it was different with us.

1:09:04.620 --> 1:09:06.490
We had something special, Elle.

1:09:06.490 --> 1:09:07.710
I go to sleep and I miss you,

1:09:07.710 --> 1:09:09.523
I wake up and my life, it's empty.

1:09:10.969 --> 1:09:12.633
I need you, Elle.

1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:15.792
I love you.

1:09:18.170 --> 1:09:20.370
Carmen's with her parents
on Saturday night.

1:09:21.410 --> 1:09:24.292
Have dinner with me, please.

1:09:28.770 --> 1:09:29.603
- I can't.

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:34.532
I have a hot date.

1:09:35.814 --> 1:09:36.960
(light dramatic music)

1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:39.000
- [Elle Voiceover] I
had no idea that cruelty

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.893
could feel so good.

1:09:44.620 --> 1:09:47.360
- Do you have any tall,
gorgeous male friends?

1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:48.193
- Sure.

1:09:49.430 --> 1:09:51.059
- Black?

1:09:51.059 --> 1:09:52.460
- Yeah, of course.

1:09:52.460 --> 1:09:53.754
- Straight?

1:09:53.754 --> 1:09:55.680
- Ah, can't help you there.

1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:56.513
- No.

1:09:56.513 --> 1:09:58.510
So you're not racist, you're just-

1:09:58.510 --> 1:09:59.809
- Heterophobic, yeah.

1:09:59.809 --> 1:10:00.683
- Yeah, breeders?

1:10:04.490 --> 1:10:08.260
- What about a tall
gorgeous black male friend

1:10:08.260 --> 1:10:10.980
that can pass as straight?

1:10:10.980 --> 1:10:13.420
- [Katie Voiceover] Oh, my God.

1:10:13.420 --> 1:10:14.323
I love it.

1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:18.680
- [Elle Voiceover] Why is
it no matter how liberal

1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:21.330
a white guy is, when
it comes to a black guy

1:10:21.330 --> 1:10:23.693
boning his girl he goes full Albright?

1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:25.713
- [Katie Voiceover] I think it's 'cause of

1:10:25.713 --> 1:10:27.393
the true myth about black dicks.

1:10:28.870 --> 1:10:31.460
- [Elle Voiceover] Maybe deep
down they wanna suck one.

1:10:31.460 --> 1:10:33.361
- Don't we all.
(doorbell dings)

1:10:33.361 --> 1:10:34.930
(crickets chirping)

1:10:34.930 --> 1:10:36.583
- Oh, hey, gorgeous.

1:10:38.139 --> 1:10:39.499
- Back at ya, blue eyes.

1:10:39.499 --> 1:10:41.550
(Elle laughs)

1:10:41.550 --> 1:10:43.130
- It's just on the hill,
do you mind if we walk?

1:10:43.130 --> 1:10:44.053
- I prefer it.

1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:48.420
- [Elle] Don't look now, but he's across

1:10:48.420 --> 1:10:49.990
the street stalking us.

1:10:49.990 --> 1:10:51.590
Don't worry, he's not dangerous.

1:10:53.684 --> 1:10:55.072
- I'm not worried about a thing.

1:10:55.072 --> 1:10:57.116
- (laughs) You're smooth.

1:10:57.116 --> 1:11:00.120
- I minored in theater at
Arizona State University.

1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:00.952
(phone dings)

1:11:00.952 --> 1:11:02.730
Is he live tweeting this?

1:11:02.730 --> 1:11:04.680
- No, he's texting me.

1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:06.160
It's working.

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:06.993
Mute!

1:11:08.357 --> 1:11:11.000
- By the way, adore
the Miu Miu Slingbacks.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.020
- Well, thank you, Connor picked them out.

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:13.853
- Figured.

1:11:13.853 --> 1:11:16.318
- Why, because the rest
of my outfit is shit?

1:11:16.318 --> 1:11:17.780
(laughs) Oh, great.

1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:20.447
(light jazz music)

1:11:21.330 --> 1:11:22.713
- Did locusts attack these?

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:25.410
This is unacceptable.

1:11:26.420 --> 1:11:28.785
It's time for you to woman the hell up.

1:11:28.785 --> 1:11:30.285
You're not a teenager anymore.

1:11:31.580 --> 1:11:32.723
- What do you suggest?

1:11:34.037 --> 1:11:36.480
- "La French" as the French call it,

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:37.830
even though we invented it.

1:11:38.860 --> 1:11:41.570
Pale pink base, white tip.

1:11:41.570 --> 1:11:45.383
Womanly, sophisticated, timeless.

1:11:46.267 --> 1:11:47.166
- Well, that's me.

1:11:48.490 --> 1:11:49.940
- And leave these poor cuticles alone.

1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:52.573
If you're angry, chew out other people.

1:11:55.460 --> 1:11:56.886
- Wow.

1:11:56.886 --> 1:11:58.670
You should be a life coach.

1:11:58.670 --> 1:11:59.920
- Connor didn't tell you?

1:12:00.790 --> 1:12:02.210
It's what I am.

1:12:02.210 --> 1:12:03.718
(Elle laughs)

1:12:04.893 --> 1:12:05.817
(crickets chirping)

1:12:05.817 --> 1:12:07.166
(Elle hums)

1:12:10.370 --> 1:12:12.270
- You know, if you were into vagina

1:12:12.270 --> 1:12:14.719
this night would definitely not be over.

1:12:14.719 --> 1:12:16.146
At least, I'd hope not.

1:12:16.146 --> 1:12:18.302
- Oh, we'd just be getting started.

1:12:18.302 --> 1:12:19.934
(both chuckling)

1:12:22.209 --> 1:12:23.725
(Elle giggles)

1:12:26.037 --> 1:12:27.037
- Thank you.

1:12:29.633 --> 1:12:31.025
(door clicks)

1:12:32.725 --> 1:12:34.142
Goodnight.
- Yeah.

1:12:36.088 --> 1:12:37.286
(door clicks)

1:12:38.228 --> 1:12:39.835
(crickets chirping)

1:12:47.088 --> 1:12:49.055
(door rustling)

1:12:51.004 --> 1:12:52.146
(lock clicks)

1:13:06.036 --> 1:13:07.911
(phone dings)

1:13:19.192 --> 1:13:20.442
(phone dings)

1:13:30.116 --> 1:13:32.499
(light dramatic music)

1:13:34.860 --> 1:13:36.820
- [Elle Voiceover] While
he was sending them

1:13:36.820 --> 1:13:38.950
Carmen was probably on her way home

1:13:38.950 --> 1:13:40.623
ready to crawl into bed with him.

1:13:42.110 --> 1:13:43.750
Carmen, who believed he had sex

1:13:43.750 --> 1:13:45.803
with me only once out of pity.

1:13:48.940 --> 1:13:51.139
I didn't forward her the dirtiest ones,

1:13:51.139 --> 1:13:54.323
just the ones where it was
really obvious we were in love.

1:13:55.217 --> 1:13:56.740
(light music)

1:13:56.740 --> 1:13:58.393
- [Katie Voiceover]
Did you write anything?

1:13:59.350 --> 1:14:01.250
- [Elle Voiceover] I kept it simple.

1:14:01.250 --> 1:14:04.663
Dave just sent me these, I'm moving on.

1:14:05.630 --> 1:14:06.523
Why can't he?

1:14:14.124 --> 1:14:15.183
(Elle sighs)

1:14:25.032 --> 1:14:26.245
(hand knocking)

1:14:27.303 --> 1:14:28.719
- [Elle] Come in.

1:14:34.250 --> 1:14:35.083
- Stay.

1:14:36.490 --> 1:14:37.323
- What's wrong?

1:14:40.980 --> 1:14:42.293
- I just spoke to Dave.

1:14:44.250 --> 1:14:45.083
He's in jail.

1:14:47.448 --> 1:14:48.548
- What? What happened?

1:14:51.180 --> 1:14:54.112
- When you sent the photos
to Carmen she kicked him out.

1:14:56.170 --> 1:14:58.070
Told him that he'd hear from her lawyer.

1:14:58.070 --> 1:15:00.420
And then she threatened
to move away with Esme.

1:15:02.930 --> 1:15:04.257
He can't explained what happened next.

1:15:04.257 --> 1:15:07.603
"Something snapped", he said.

1:15:10.230 --> 1:15:13.870
- What did he do?
(light dramatic music)

1:15:13.870 --> 1:15:15.430
- He beat the shit out of her.

1:15:16.780 --> 1:15:18.833
She's in intensive care at St. Luke's.

1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:21.550
Fractured skull, broken jaw,

1:15:21.550 --> 1:15:23.130
one of her implants has ruptured.

1:15:23.130 --> 1:15:25.040
Esme saw the whole thing from the landing.

1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:25.873
- Oh, my God.

1:15:26.962 --> 1:15:29.610
- Lucky for you, he's pleading guilty.

1:15:29.610 --> 1:15:31.330
He won't contest the divorce,

1:15:31.330 --> 1:15:33.083
he won't contest the sole custody.

1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:36.400
That means no trial.

1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:40.398
You won't get dragged into it.

1:15:40.398 --> 1:15:41.398
- (sighs) Thank god.

1:15:42.969 --> 1:15:44.370
- But I'm finished with you.

1:15:45.996 --> 1:15:46.830
- No.

1:15:47.719 --> 1:15:49.090
No, please.

1:15:49.090 --> 1:15:50.559
Please, I'm sorry.

1:15:50.559 --> 1:15:52.610
- You had every right to lash out on him.

1:15:55.330 --> 1:15:56.430
But not to his family.

1:15:58.570 --> 1:16:01.389
Carmen did nothing to you, nothing.

1:16:01.389 --> 1:16:02.590
Esme did nothing to you.

1:16:07.770 --> 1:16:08.943
You're dangerous, Elle.

1:16:11.820 --> 1:16:14.719
You're ruled by your obsessions,
you have no self control.

1:16:19.780 --> 1:16:22.663
Go home, get help,

1:16:25.130 --> 1:16:26.197
figure your shit out.

1:16:34.773 --> 1:16:36.129
(door thuds)

1:16:36.129 --> 1:16:38.546
(Elle cries)

1:16:40.750 --> 1:16:43.862
- I had no idea that Dave
was capable of violence.

1:16:46.780 --> 1:16:47.843
Like my dad.

1:16:50.269 --> 1:16:52.250
Like my mom's godson Leon after he pinned

1:16:52.250 --> 1:16:53.683
me down when I was seven.

1:16:55.100 --> 1:16:57.270
Like Dad who couldn't
go more than a few weeks

1:16:57.270 --> 1:16:58.623
without hitting me.

1:16:59.940 --> 1:17:01.952
- [Katie Voiceover]
You're breaking my heart.

1:17:05.327 --> 1:17:06.160
- I'm sorry.

1:17:08.290 --> 1:17:09.270
- [Katie Voiceover] Kevin's taking Sarah

1:17:09.270 --> 1:17:11.600
to his parent's in Michigan this weekend.

1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:14.180
Let's meet up finally.

1:17:14.180 --> 1:17:15.112
Please.

1:17:16.139 --> 1:17:17.593
It's time to trust again.

1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:19.993
Let me take care of you.

1:17:21.041 --> 1:17:21.875
(traffic humming)

1:17:21.875 --> 1:17:23.950
- Why are you always looking backwards?

1:17:23.950 --> 1:17:26.150
You need to dwell on the future.

1:17:26.150 --> 1:17:27.730
Pick a dream, make it come true.

1:17:27.730 --> 1:17:30.278
- I don't know, it just
feels like sometimes

1:17:30.278 --> 1:17:32.370
like no mater what I do I always end up

1:17:32.370 --> 1:17:34.840
with a guy who hates women.

1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:38.650
Like I can't help it, like
it's my destiny or something.

1:17:38.650 --> 1:17:40.330
- You know that's bullshit.

1:17:40.330 --> 1:17:41.730
There's good men everywhere.

1:17:42.700 --> 1:17:44.889
Well, okay, not everywhere.

1:17:44.889 --> 1:17:48.600
But they're around and
you just don't see them.

1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:50.800
And you won't until you
get your mind right.

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:55.170
- What, like medication?

1:17:55.170 --> 1:17:59.510
- Or yoga or therapy or church.

1:17:59.510 --> 1:18:01.558
Or maybe you hug kids with cancer.

1:18:01.558 --> 1:18:03.380
(Elle laughs)

1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:05.983
You just need to stop
expecting a man to save you.

1:18:07.114 --> 1:18:08.920
It's just you, Elle.

1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:09.963
Nobody else.

1:18:10.980 --> 1:18:13.612
Hard work, the journey inward.

1:18:17.781 --> 1:18:18.790
(Elle sighs)

1:18:19.639 --> 1:18:23.532
- You know, I'm gonna
miss our run on Saturday.

1:18:24.559 --> 1:18:26.110
I'm going out Friday
night and I'm expecting

1:18:26.110 --> 1:18:27.563
to have a massive hangover.

1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:29.862
- Is it a date?

1:18:32.175 --> 1:18:33.508
- Yeah.

1:18:47.410 --> 1:18:48.969
I didn't tell anyone.

1:18:48.969 --> 1:18:49.803
What about you?

It's a bar that used to be a diner.

1:19:01.910 --> 1:19:03.730
Amazing martinis.

at the motel next door

1:19:29.210 --> 1:19:31.793

1:22:27.969 --> 1:22:29.053
that you punked out.

1:22:30.559 --> 1:22:32.809
Or maybe before Kevin left he handcuffed

you to the stove.

Why don't I have your phone number?

Right, it's your stupid
jealous husband's fault.

You know, if they really
think that we're such whores

made you keep me a secret.

I've only left New Mexico

1:29:13.290 --> 1:29:15.860
one time and it was for boarding school.

1:29:15.860 --> 1:29:18.430
I've never even see the ocean.

1:29:18.430 --> 1:29:20.725
I want an exciting life like yours.

1:29:22.630 --> 1:29:23.469
- [Female Reader] Hi, Katie.

1:29:23.469 --> 1:29:25.650
My name is Annie Dormer.

1:29:25.650 --> 1:29:28.090
I feel faintly idiotic
even typing your name

1:29:28.090 --> 1:29:29.770
because you're a fictional character,

1:29:29.770 --> 1:29:33.253
but I just wanted to say
I wish you were real.

1:29:37.230 --> 1:29:39.230
- [Female Reader] Katie,
is this really the best

1:29:39.230 --> 1:29:40.740
our society can do?

1:29:40.740 --> 1:29:42.559
To treat females this way?

1:29:42.559 --> 1:29:45.653
We're the world's mothers,
sisters and daughters.

1:29:47.300 --> 1:29:49.400
- [Annie Voiceover] Annie
Dormer again, I just had

1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:51.290
the weirdest dream about you.

1:29:51.290 --> 1:29:53.080
We were at a party, you
said that you were gonna

1:29:53.080 --> 1:29:54.980
have sex with this hot guy you just met

1:29:54.980 --> 1:29:56.393
and did I wanna watch?

1:29:57.330 --> 1:30:02.112
I got scared because
for some reason I did.

1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:06.450
- [Female Reader] Katie,
my dad died at work.

1:30:06.450 --> 1:30:08.880
He was basically cut in two.

1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:10.290
I don't think I even loved him,

1:30:10.290 --> 1:30:14.728
but just like you, his
death scarred me for life.

1:30:16.210 --> 1:30:18.778
- [Annie] The whole world
is drowning in lies.

1:30:19.860 --> 1:30:21.770
Our hearts are in constant pain

of a sort we can neither
identify nor feel.

1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:30.452
We're not human, just virtually human.

1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:34.969
Your honest, brave, lively spirit is just

1:30:34.969 --> 1:30:36.520
what the world needs right now.

1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:38.309
What I need.
