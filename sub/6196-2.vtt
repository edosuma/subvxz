MARY JANE: [gasping]

00:03.701 --> 00:06.198

00:06.214 --> 00:08.157
You're at Southern
Regional Hospital.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.508
You've been in a car accident.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.750
I should be thanking you.

00:10.752 --> 00:13.515
There's no telling how long
they would have left me in that hallway,

00:13.517 --> 00:14.869
if you hadn't said something.

00:14.871 --> 00:16.884
It's my fault you're
here in the first place.

00:16.886 --> 00:19.650
You had alcohol in your system.
You need to call your lawyer.

00:19.652 --> 00:22.720
Tracy's in county lock-up.
Bail's set at $3,000.

00:22.722 --> 00:25.724
We're gonna have some fun
till mommy comes home.
- When is she coming home?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.241
This should help
ease your pain.

00:27.243 --> 00:30.061
It isn't a lot considering
it's hush money.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.987
$100,000 and you sign today.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.466
Why'd they even bring up your
alcohol level in the first place?

00:35.481 --> 00:37.869
They're trying to get rid of me.

00:39.670 --> 00:43.573
Listen, we provided her with the best
plastic surgeon in the country,

00:43.575 --> 00:46.129
a cost that we didn't
put on her tab, so...

00:46.254 --> 00:47.996
I'd say we're pretty supportive

00:47.998 --> 00:50.082
and we look forward
to her return when she's ready.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.416
[speaking Spanish]

00:58.138 --> 01:01.140
Mary Jane's doctor says she'll
be good to go in three weeks.

01:01.142 --> 01:03.093
Let's see how she heals first,

01:03.095 --> 01:04.953
before we commit to a timetable...

01:06.078 --> 01:08.230
or at least until
we complete our investigation.

01:08.732 --> 01:11.120
It's a standard practice in
situations like these

01:11.122 --> 01:12.952
where alcohol is proven
to be involved.

01:12.954 --> 01:15.427
Even when the alcohol
was provided by SNC?

01:15.429 --> 01:18.078
SNC ain't feelin' me?
That's cool.

01:18.775 --> 01:21.513
I've given them the
best journalism.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.224
After years,

01:23.226 --> 01:26.951
SNC should be kissing my ass
begging me to come back!

01:26.953 --> 01:28.998
We're talking about your
client possibly having

01:29.000 --> 01:31.170
a drinking problem.
- Easy there, Sy.

01:31.472 --> 01:33.638
We're walking into
slanderous territory now.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.314
Not when it's true.

01:35.316 --> 01:37.475
I need to talk to Roy

01:37.515 --> 01:39.534
and make sure he doesn't
cave to that... oh!

01:39.536 --> 01:41.347
You're the ones that sent
her the champagne.

01:41.349 --> 01:44.183
Congratulations, Mary Jane.
Remember?

01:44.485 --> 01:46.434
But it's not just champagne.

01:46.436 --> 01:49.704
Mary Jane Paul keeps
a bottle of tequila in her desk

01:49.706 --> 01:53.367
and she likes to knock back a few drinks
before she leaves the office.

01:53.953 --> 01:55.569
SNC cameras recorded everything.

01:55.570 --> 01:57.450
Um... oh, uh, rice, rice!

01:57.452 --> 01:58.820
We need... we need rice!
Yeah, we need rice.

01:58.822 --> 02:01.616
Mary Jane helped build
this network's reputation, okay?

02:01.618 --> 02:04.002
She works harder
than anybody here.

02:04.255 --> 02:07.301
Now you're really gonna
put your star anchor

02:07.303 --> 02:08.880
through an internal investigation?

02:08.882 --> 02:11.711
I mean, she is the new
face of this network.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.750
Right, and being

02:13.914 --> 02:17.415
the face of the network
comes with responsibilities.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.033
Page 28 of her contract

02:19.035 --> 02:21.135
specifies that any instances

02:21.137 --> 02:24.161
of moral turpitude which can
harm the network's reputation

02:24.163 --> 02:26.014
are grounds for termination.

02:26.022 --> 02:28.053
But we're sure you
reminded her of that.

02:28.057 --> 02:30.885
Okay, let's all just take
a step back here for a second.

02:30.887 --> 02:32.871
There's no need to throw
the "t" word around.

02:32.873 --> 02:34.495
It's not necessary, okay?

02:34.497 --> 02:36.935
[clearing throat]

02:37.954 --> 02:40.829
Listen... I know you're
fighting for your client

02:40.831 --> 02:44.695
and that's admirable,
but if you wanna fight hard for someone,

02:44.804 --> 02:47.980
you don't the middle-aged
Black woman with an attitude

02:47.982 --> 02:50.232
and a drinking problem, okay?

02:51.084 --> 02:53.076
They're not worth the risk.

02:53.837 --> 02:57.756
What is she worth to you, Sy?

03:01.095 --> 03:02.134
We wait.

03:02.330 --> 03:06.051
The lady on YouTube said we have to
soak the phone in the ricefor 24 hours.

03:06.850 --> 03:08.796

Good morning, Miss Paul.

03:23.502 --> 03:26.488
I know it's improper to stop
by unannounced and for that

03:26.490 --> 03:29.771
I'm really sorry, but, uh,
I had to speak to you.

03:29.773 --> 03:32.683
How did you get my address, um...
- Cece.

03:32.685 --> 03:35.837
Cece. Cece, oh... Wow,

03:35.839 --> 03:37.946
I must have been really
dizzy after the accident.

03:37.948 --> 03:39.610
I don't usually use checks

03:39.612 --> 03:43.203
from my personal account.
- Well, it happens.

03:43.205 --> 03:44.595
[laughs]
Uhhuh.

03:44.597 --> 03:47.048
You're lookin' well, though.
- Thank you.

03:47.090 --> 03:49.064
It's what a girl with holes
in her face loves to hear.

03:49.066 --> 03:50.925
So, what brings you by?

03:51.324 --> 03:55.454
Well, a few days ago, I was at SNC
discussing my settlement...

03:55.456 --> 03:57.492
Why were you even talking
to them?

03:58.110 --> 04:02.133
I have, uh, your lab reports
after the accident.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.740
How did you get those?

04:05.742 --> 04:06.913
Well,

04:06.959 --> 04:10.224
I know a nurse badly
in need of a Celine purse,

04:10.245 --> 04:13.081
so I just made a contribution
to her endeavor.

04:13.083 --> 04:16.475

04:16.476 --> 04:18.786
[winces] Ooh.

04:18.789 --> 04:21.523
It's, um, kinda warm out here. Can...

04:22.351 --> 04:24.874
can I come inside and we talk?

04:25.962 --> 04:28.847
Yeah, come in. You can
go out to the patio.

04:28.849 --> 04:32.675
It's cooler out there.
- Oh. All right then.

04:33.805 --> 04:36.072
Oooh.

04:41.643 --> 04:44.463
Vilma? Vilma?
- Si. Si.
- Where's... where's Louie?

04:44.465 --> 04:45.847
I put in the hall closet.

04:45.849 --> 04:47.564
Why would you put
it in the closet?

04:47.566 --> 04:48.941
Because you said clean.
I clean.

04:48.943 --> 04:51.212
Yeah, clean, but
don't move Louie.

05:01.247 --> 05:02.653

I still may need this
Louisville Slugger.

05:19.883 --> 05:23.711
What do you want?
- To help you out of
your dilemma, Miss Paul.

05:23.828 --> 05:27.400
May I...
- No. No. Only guests sit.

05:28.242 --> 05:29.257
What dilemma?

05:29.259 --> 05:31.196
Well, we need to help each other

05:31.962 --> 05:34.395
'cause with this
lab report and this check,

05:34.654 --> 05:37.201
you're startin' to look like you're
responsible for that accident.

05:37.202 --> 05:38.374
I wasn't drunk.

05:38.376 --> 05:40.320
You were the one who
jumped the light and made the left.

05:40.322 --> 05:42.423
That's not what
your check says.

05:42.823 --> 05:46.484
Now you wrote in the
memo line: I'm sorry.

05:47.210 --> 05:49.786
I think any court would conclude

05:49.788 --> 05:51.644
that you're sorry for runnin' into me...

05:52.412 --> 05:54.264
and that's an admission of guilt.

05:56.219 --> 05:58.349
How much to get you out of my house

05:58.351 --> 06:00.326
and back to the bowling alley, hm?

06:01.656 --> 06:04.259
Just $25,000.
- Twenty-five thousand?

06:04.261 --> 06:06.427
Are you... for a piece of paper?

06:06.429 --> 06:09.557
Oh, baby, you need to use your
Obamacare and get your head checked.

06:11.017 --> 06:13.256
You signed the
non-disclosure, right?

06:13.904 --> 06:18.857
You can't sue, okay? So,
thank you for stopping by

06:18.859 --> 06:22.143
and take your happy
ass outta my house.

06:22.145 --> 06:24.579
You're absolutely correct.

06:24.581 --> 06:26.865
By signing the non-disclosure,

06:26.867 --> 06:28.917
it forestalled me from pursuing

06:28.919 --> 06:31.786
any legal action against SNC.

06:31.788 --> 06:35.823
But now you, Miss Paul,
that's a different story.

06:35.825 --> 06:37.491
See, I read the entire document

06:37.493 --> 06:41.796
and, um, there was
no mention of you.

06:41.798 --> 06:45.530
The non-disclosure... it doesn't
protect you, it protects them.

06:46.102 --> 06:48.095
Now let's just say some... some

06:48.097 --> 06:49.977
evidence were to pop up...

06:50.292 --> 06:51.777
[laughing]

06:52.809 --> 06:56.477
Maybe the results of
your lab reports.

06:56.479 --> 07:00.897
That leaves you vulnerable
to a civil lawsuit.

07:01.851 --> 07:03.299
Let me show you this document.

07:03.987 --> 07:06.503

of despair

Just when I thought

07:52.625 --> 07:55.047
God had forsaken me,

07:56.305 --> 07:58.371
you crashed into my car.

07:58.508 --> 08:00.723
I didn't think anything
of it at first.

08:00.725 --> 08:03.962
In fact, it wasn't until SNC

08:03.964 --> 08:06.485
made me an offer to make me go away

08:06.487 --> 08:08.545

Okay, um,

08:25.679 --> 08:26.990
it's obvious

that you have completely

08:28.405 --> 08:30.862

08:31.159 --> 08:33.563
so, if you just leave now,

08:33.764 --> 08:37.412
I will give you a head start
before I call the police.

08:37.414 --> 08:39.234

08:52.290 --> 08:54.311
and being a woman of moral fiber,

08:54.313 --> 08:57.682
I will dispose the truth

Hello? Hey, Roy?

11:06.578 --> 11:07.945
ROY: [on phone] Yeah. Yeah.
I'm here, Mary Jane.

11:07.947 --> 11:09.947
I have to put you on speaker.
I'm having some phone issues.

11:09.949 --> 11:12.198
ROY: Yeah, no problem. Listen,
I've got Arthur here with me.

11:12.347 --> 11:13.605
Uh, how are you holding up?

11:13.607 --> 11:15.716
Well, that depends
on what SNC says.

11:15.935 --> 11:18.802
Mary Jane, they wanna hold out
a little longer than we'd like.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.717
Uh, they feel terrible, but...

11:20.844 --> 11:22.060
MARY JANE: How long?

11:22.062 --> 11:23.952
They won't commit to a time.
- MARY JANE: They won't commit?

11:23.954 --> 11:25.430
Why won't they commit?

11:25.432 --> 11:27.002
Look, what does that even mean?

11:27.096 --> 11:28.733
The doctor said I'll be
ready in three weeks.

11:28.735 --> 11:30.862
I'm healing. I'm gonna be ready.
- ARTHUR: Okay, Mary Jane, Arthur.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.336
This may actually
be a good thing.

11:32.338 --> 11:35.089
How, Arthur? Without a firm date,

11:35.359 --> 11:36.626
we lose momentum.

11:36.628 --> 11:38.829
Or you're creating
more of a buzz.

11:39.079 --> 11:40.905
Ever since your
"Ugly Black Woman" commentary

11:40.907 --> 11:42.378
created a feeding frenzy,

11:42.380 --> 11:44.487
right, your TVQ ratings
shot up ten points

11:44.489 --> 11:46.573
and that's before
the "Prime Time" job was offered.

11:46.824 --> 11:49.800
Look, the fans want
you back on air ASAP, but...

11:49.879 --> 11:51.800
but the longer you
make them wait,

11:51.855 --> 11:53.657
the greater their appetite
is gonna be for you.

11:53.659 --> 11:57.013
Well, is it still gonna say
"Prime Time with Mary Jane Paul"
behind my fill-in?

11:57.256 --> 12:00.136
ARTHUR: Uh, no,
it'll just say "Prime Time,"
but don't worry, okay?

12:01.468 --> 12:03.952
Oh, I guess I could use this time to...

12:04.639 --> 12:07.569
relax and catch up
on some reading.

12:08.272 --> 12:11.108
That is great, Mary Jane.
Listen, we will call as soon
as we hear anything.

12:11.110 --> 12:14.584
Oh, Arthur, wait, um,
I have a question about my accident.

12:14.586 --> 12:15.897
Sure, what's up?

12:15.899 --> 12:17.781
Is there any way,
you know, like...

12:18.227 --> 12:20.266
down the line,
in the future, that I...

12:20.344 --> 12:21.719
might be...

12:22.679 --> 12:25.038
financially responsible
for the accident?

12:25.139 --> 12:27.574
Mary Jane, that's all
been taken care of, okay?

12:27.576 --> 12:29.256
The lady signed the
non-disclosure,

12:29.258 --> 12:32.196
she took her check.
It's over, okay? Relax.

12:32.362 --> 12:36.254
Well, uh, what if my
blood results got leaked?

12:37.170 --> 12:39.271
You have a signed
non-disclosure,

12:39.273 --> 12:42.069
okay, and even if you didn't,
without admission of guilt,
you're fine.

12:42.077 --> 12:44.994
So, do me a favor... stop digging
in the bottom of the "what if" barrel

12:45.069 --> 12:46.788
and get some rest, okay?
I've gotta go.

12:47.327 --> 12:50.436
Thanks, Arthur.
Mary Jane?

12:50.949 --> 12:52.190
Mary Jane?

12:52.192 --> 12:54.685
[dial tone]
She hung up.

12:54.887 --> 12:58.074
It's been 13 years since the historic
Memorandum of Understanding

12:58.160 --> 13:00.517
was signed between
the multi-ethnic media coalition

13:00.519 --> 13:02.693
and the top television
broadcast networks.

13:02.695 --> 13:05.090
All right, okay. What organization
are you with again?

13:05.364 --> 13:07.248
National Council of La Raza.

13:07.644 --> 13:09.698
Oh, yeah, you're the organization

13:09.700 --> 13:11.971
that grades the networks
with color charts like
we're in kindergarten.

13:11.972 --> 13:12.901
[laughing]

13:12.903 --> 13:14.994
We just wanna make sure
everyone, no matter race,

13:14.996 --> 13:17.908
gender, or sexual orientation

13:17.910 --> 13:19.610
has a seat at the table.

13:19.612 --> 13:22.993
And by everyone, you
mean Latin people.

13:24.617 --> 13:26.928
The Latino population has
grown considerably

13:27.296 --> 13:28.756
and our organization
wants to make sure

13:28.758 --> 13:31.296
that someone within the network
represents our interests.

13:31.358 --> 13:34.847
Well, we have representation here...
Kara Lynch, and she's Latino.

13:34.849 --> 13:35.975
[chuckles]

13:36.962 --> 13:37.967
[sighing]

13:37.969 --> 13:39.501
Something amuses you, Mr.
Casales?

13:39.503 --> 13:42.338
That you tout your one
and only Latin as progress.

13:42.526 --> 13:45.057
The truth is, SNC lags behind
its competitors

13:45.127 --> 13:47.156
in terms of both
Latino on-air staff

13:47.158 --> 13:49.190
and adequate
coverage of Latino issues.

13:49.192 --> 13:53.160
Now we're two weeks away
from submitting our diversity
report for the quarter

13:53.293 --> 13:56.322
and we'd hate to see SNC get an "F."

13:59.093 --> 14:00.365
Great.

14:03.555 --> 14:05.921
Let's go. Pass! Pass!
Get that ball passed quicker!

14:05.921 --> 14:08.725
Move it along, move it along.
I need a snap pass, let's go.

14:09.038 --> 14:11.473
Come on, get the ball
out there quick, let's go.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.053
Get down here. Get down.

14:13.055 --> 14:15.185
All right, D'Asia, today,
you gotta remember, baby.
You gotta remember.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.690
Right hand, left foot. There you go.
Oh, beautiful. Beautiful. Perfect.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.172
Just like your daddy, unh!
Good.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.099
[laughing] You wish.

14:23.101 --> 14:25.081
Hey, doll. Hey, you
made it on time.

14:25.944 --> 14:28.124
Mommy!
- Hi, baby!

14:28.126 --> 14:30.444
I told you, Daddy, she wasn't
gonna miss my practice.

14:30.446 --> 14:31.833
You did. [laughs]

14:31.835 --> 14:33.835
You know, baby, I
used to play basketball.

14:33.837 --> 14:36.254
A two-time state champ
in high school.

14:36.646 --> 14:37.828
[grunt of effort]

14:38.107 --> 14:39.524
It's all about the follow through.

14:39.662 --> 14:42.464
Your mama was money
from 20 feet out.

14:43.396 --> 14:45.480
What's that?

14:49.518 --> 14:53.023
Oh...
- Hey, hey, we got
a little straggler here..

14:53.025 --> 14:55.239
Young lady...
we're still practicing.

14:56.192 --> 14:58.403
Come on, D'Asia, girl,
remember to follow through
with your jump shot.

14:58.405 --> 15:00.231
D'Asia, good. Opposite hand,
opposite foot.

15:00.829 --> 15:03.046
She's getting so big so fast.

15:03.048 --> 15:04.360
Yeah and with an appetite to match.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.185
BOTH: [laughing]

15:08.288 --> 15:10.288
I was worried I wasn't
gonna make it on time.

15:10.290 --> 15:12.290
I had to take three
buses to get here.

15:12.292 --> 15:14.408
Oh, what time's your curfew?

15:14.410 --> 15:16.577
I have to be in by
7:00, not a second late.

15:16.579 --> 15:18.796
Oh, well, that doesn't
give you a lot of time.

15:18.798 --> 15:21.966
Not like it's right
up the highway.

15:21.968 --> 15:24.835
I also have to take a
drug counselling class.

15:24.837 --> 15:27.297
But without a car, I'm
not so mobile now.

15:30.042 --> 15:32.977
I don't know if I'm even
gonna make her first game.

15:32.979 --> 15:35.450
Oh, you can't miss that.

15:36.432 --> 15:40.068
Um, maybe, uh, I can pick you up
so you can be here on time.

15:42.086 --> 15:43.848
Yeah.

15:46.006 --> 15:48.690
Oh, D'Asia, all right, remember...
remember, follow through.

15:48.693 --> 15:50.487
Yeah, exactly like your
father said.

15:59.694 --> 16:01.564
PATRICK: That's good, baby, good.

16:02.558 --> 16:04.208
What about my money
market account?

16:04.210 --> 16:06.858
JERRY [on phone]: It would take
at least two days to get
the funds released,

16:06.860 --> 16:09.064
plus, you would have to pay
the penalty for early withdrawal.

16:09.066 --> 16:10.978
Of course, there's a penalty
for early withdrawal.

16:10.980 --> 16:12.517
Okay, um...

16:12.902 --> 16:15.191
Let me tell you what...
so, why don't you just
give me five grand.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.498
JERRY: Please tell me it's not shoes.

16:17.985 --> 16:19.941
Not shoes.
[cell phone beeping]

16:19.943 --> 16:23.169
Jerry, I've gotta take this call,
but how soon can you message me
the money tomorrow?

16:23.375 --> 16:26.197
It'll be there before sundown.
- Thanks.

16:26.199 --> 16:29.233
[cell phone beeps]
Kara, what's shakin'?

16:29.969 --> 16:32.592
KARA: Ted is out and they
want me to find a replacement.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.372
MARY JANE: It doesn't make any sense.

16:35.144 --> 16:37.311
You just need a warm body
in the chair until I get back.

16:37.313 --> 16:38.869
What's the emergency?

16:39.230 --> 16:41.486
KARA: Apparently, we dipped
a bit in the overnights

16:41.488 --> 16:43.728
and now it's DEFCON 5
all of a sudden.

16:45.268 --> 16:46.483
MARY JANE: Who do they want?

16:46.485 --> 16:48.078
KARA: The next best thing to you...

16:48.080 --> 16:49.757
or at least someone
that looks like you.

16:51.426 --> 16:53.168
MARY JANE: Oh, God, they're trying
to get rid of me, aren't they?

16:53.170 --> 16:55.029
KARA: Stop, okay, don't... don't panic.

16:55.031 --> 16:57.531
MARY JANE: Oh, my God.
- KARA: Sit tight. Sit tight.

16:57.563 --> 16:58.595
MARY JANE: Oh, my God.

16:58.597 --> 17:01.042
KARA: Have you eaten, 'cause
I can stop by the soul food place

17:01.044 --> 17:02.790
and pick you up a little something.

17:03.269 --> 17:04.568
MARY JANE: Fried chicken,

17:04.569 --> 17:07.335
yeah, and pancakes from that
spot across the street.

17:07.751 --> 17:09.954
Oh, and red beans and rice
and sausage from, um,

17:09.955 --> 17:12.265
Fred's on Peachtree, okay?

17:13.005 --> 17:15.721
[doorbell ringing] MARY JANE:
And pizza, yeah, pizza.

17:16.356 --> 17:18.582
And a 7-Up
cake from Jimmy's.

17:18.584 --> 17:21.785
KARA: What?
- MARY JANE: They'll know
what I'm talking about.

17:21.787 --> 17:25.105
So, I'm just supposed to act like

17:25.107 --> 17:26.790
I don't know what's going on.

17:26.791 --> 17:29.633
I'm just supposed to stay home
and relax

17:29.635 --> 17:31.809
while they try to replace me with

17:31.811 --> 17:33.026
random Black women.

17:33.708 --> 17:36.057
It's like...
like what I do

17:36.106 --> 17:38.249
doesn't require a skill,
like we're just...

17:38.813 --> 17:39.881
interchangeable.

17:39.883 --> 17:42.562
We're all just freakin'
interchangeable,

17:42.585 --> 17:43.708
you know,
like... like

17:43.710 --> 17:47.444
"insert Negro girl here,
add water and stir."

17:47.499 --> 17:48.812
Interchangeable!

17:48.814 --> 17:52.524
And, Greg, that balding
sow, never did like me.

17:52.526 --> 17:54.672
He never did. And I swear
to God,

17:54.674 --> 17:56.382
if I wasn't afraid of prison,

17:56.384 --> 17:58.873
I would go
down there and I would just

17:58.875 --> 18:01.227
bash his frickin' face in!
- Okay.

18:01.227 --> 18:02.227
[sighing]

18:02.261 --> 18:03.322
Okay.

18:03.324 --> 18:06.079
I don't know if it's the pain pills

18:06.081 --> 18:08.665
or... the food or...

18:08.667 --> 18:10.901
the pain pills I took
with the food, um,

18:11.026 --> 18:12.169
I just...

18:12.413 --> 18:14.694
I just feel like I'm losing
right now,

18:15.199 --> 18:16.237
you know?

18:16.441 --> 18:18.378
Why is this happening to me, Kara?

18:18.380 --> 18:21.395
Why? Why?
I did everything right.

18:21.774 --> 18:23.524
I don't know about that.

18:23.526 --> 18:26.694
I have started to do
everything right, I mean.

18:26.696 --> 18:29.980
God, I've cut people
out of my life, right?

18:29.982 --> 18:33.617
Yes.
- I focused on my career.

18:33.619 --> 18:38.255
God, I was happy. I was
really happy, you know?

18:38.257 --> 18:42.159
After the whole David
thing, I... I just...

18:42.161 --> 18:44.635
It felt so good to be wanted

18:44.637 --> 18:46.965
and appreciated

18:47.176 --> 18:48.283
by SNC.

18:48.285 --> 18:50.542
You know, I'm not gonna lie.
Not gonna front.

18:50.544 --> 18:52.970
I needed that
validation, you know?

18:52.972 --> 18:54.800
I really did and then, bam,

18:54.802 --> 18:57.040
the whole Lisa/David

18:57.688 --> 18:59.293
bullshit.

19:00.846 --> 19:02.814
It's like everything I have
fought for

19:02.816 --> 19:05.745
and sacrificed for is just

19:06.261 --> 19:08.986
evaporating right in
front of my eyes.

19:08.988 --> 19:10.167
No.
- And... and why?

19:10.169 --> 19:13.324
Because I have a stupid
freakin' scar on my face.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.245
It's not... it's not fair,

19:15.245 --> 19:16.792
Kara. It's not fair.

19:16.794 --> 19:20.051
I...I earned the right to
be anchor of "Prime Time."

19:20.053 --> 19:21.582
I freakin' earned that.

19:21.584 --> 19:24.199
I lost my... my best friend.
I lost my man.

19:24.201 --> 19:28.005
I cannot lose my job, Kara.
- Stop. Stop.

19:28.007 --> 19:30.817
That's not gonna happen, okay?
Please.

19:31.710 --> 19:34.387
I do admit that ushering
in direct competition

19:34.389 --> 19:36.468
at your network, not a good look.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.257
You think?
- Now, this Marc Lamont,

19:39.259 --> 19:40.684
he's getting a lot of attention.

19:40.826 --> 19:43.294
How about I pitch him
filling in for you?

19:43.793 --> 19:44.925
No.

19:45.513 --> 19:46.622
Why not?

19:47.013 --> 19:49.153
I'm not gonna do it.
- What?
- I'm not gonna do it.

19:49.155 --> 19:52.857
We are gonna give them
what they want.

19:53.756 --> 19:55.065
Hire a Black woman.

19:55.380 --> 19:56.675
Not a cute Black woman.

19:56.677 --> 19:59.837
We're going to find an actual

20:00.243 --> 20:04.030
ugly Black woman, like a
really ugly Black woman.

20:05.244 --> 20:08.278
Are you high?
- No, I'm serious.

20:09.632 --> 20:12.544
Okay, MJ, what exactly
are you talking about here?

20:12.546 --> 20:14.251
Oh, God, don't
make me spell it out.

20:14.253 --> 20:16.493
No, you're gonna have to
spell this out because,

20:16.495 --> 20:18.755
first of all, it starts out with racist

20:18.757 --> 20:20.757
and it ends with
highly offensive.

20:20.759 --> 20:22.509
It's how they see us anyway...

20:22.511 --> 20:25.095
ugly, worthless, replaceable.

20:25.097 --> 20:27.786
I say give the people
what they want.

20:27.841 --> 20:29.482
MJ, just...
- No, no, trust me.

20:29.484 --> 20:32.319
This is a great idea, right?
It's perfect.

20:32.321 --> 20:35.239
Since the job is already
temporary, you sell it as

20:35.241 --> 20:38.242
an amazing opportunity for
the facially-challenged

20:38.244 --> 20:40.015
to get a shot at broadcast,

20:40.603 --> 20:41.712
right?

20:41.714 --> 20:43.360
That gesture is then seen

20:43.362 --> 20:46.508
as SNC not being about image,
but about substance.

20:46.510 --> 20:49.103
Boom, the network
gets amazing press,

20:49.205 --> 20:51.695
huge publicity for breaking
the "pretty" barrier,

20:51.947 --> 20:52.986
right?

20:53.017 --> 20:57.270
That generates more awareness
for the show just in time

20:58.589 --> 21:00.923
for a fresh-faced
Mary Jane to reappear

21:00.925 --> 21:02.596
and claim her rightful place

21:02.651 --> 21:05.533
as anchor of "Prime Time,"

21:05.947 --> 21:07.688
right, huh, huh?

21:07.690 --> 21:10.024
You keep the... the
new hire around.

21:10.026 --> 21:12.109
You let her fill
in every so often.

21:12.111 --> 21:14.311
Two Black women have jobs

21:14.313 --> 21:17.604
and all is right with the world.

21:19.068 --> 21:21.017
Okay, this, right here,

21:21.019 --> 21:23.070
is even crazy for your ass.

21:23.072 --> 21:25.219
Honey, you have hitched
your wagon to me,

21:25.665 --> 21:28.609
so if I'm out of "Prime Time,"

21:28.790 --> 21:32.362
oh, baby, we are out of "Prime
Time." Bye-bye big check.

21:32.364 --> 21:35.956
Hello, regional news. So...

21:37.536 --> 21:40.193
How ugly do you want her?
- Fugly.

21:42.108 --> 21:44.007
CHILD 1: Get it! Get it!

21:44.009 --> 21:46.086
CHILD 2: Don't shoot it past.

21:48.147 --> 21:50.731
I wish you would have told me
to wear something orange.

21:50.733 --> 21:53.342
Well, don't worry about
that, okay? It's fine.

21:53.344 --> 21:56.258
Yeah, but I wish I was wearing
the team colors like everyone else.

21:57.022 --> 21:59.456
Hey.
- Hey, Dad. Hey, Mama.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.186
HELEN: Hey, baby.
- PATRICK: Hey, sweetie.

22:01.188 --> 22:04.828
HELEN: Patrick. Does
Tracy's probation officer

22:04.830 --> 22:07.030
know where she is?
- Mama, play nice now.

22:07.032 --> 22:09.083
I'm just asking a question.

22:09.085 --> 22:11.474
Yes, they know where I am,
Mrs. Patterson.

22:11.476 --> 22:13.521
I have to get approval
to come here.

22:13.810 --> 22:16.373
Well, as long as the authorities
know where you are.

22:16.375 --> 22:19.876
We don't want any drama,
you know, that upsets

22:19.878 --> 22:22.866
the family or... or D'Asia.
- Mama.

22:26.434 --> 22:29.161
SPECTATORS: [cheering]

22:29.161 --> 22:31.449
You got it, baby.
- Go, go, go!

22:32.224 --> 22:34.491
SPECTATORS: [cheering]

22:34.493 --> 22:36.694
That's great, baby, yeah.

22:42.053 --> 22:43.426
Great job with D'Asia.
- Oh.

22:43.428 --> 22:45.808
Looks like the practicing paid off.
- I know, right.

22:45.810 --> 22:48.186
We know where she
gets the talent from.
- Oh, thank you ladies.

22:48.188 --> 22:51.043
Actually, I'm the one that won
two championships playing basketball.

22:51.045 --> 22:54.748
Hi, I'm Tracy, D'Asia's mom.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

22:56.162 --> 22:57.560
Girl, relax.
People didn't know.

22:57.562 --> 22:59.786
Well, maybe had you
introduced me.

23:01.054 --> 23:03.231
I just want everyone to know
where she gets her talent from

23:03.233 --> 23:06.456
because it's not you
or your family.

23:07.226 --> 23:09.393
That gift came from me.
- Okay, fine.

23:09.395 --> 23:10.566
Stop making a scene.

23:10.568 --> 23:14.431
SPECTATORS: [shouting]

23:14.433 --> 23:16.433
[cheering]
[whistle shrills]

23:16.435 --> 23:19.936
Foul, number 31.
- There we go. All right.

23:19.938 --> 23:21.408
All right, baby, you got it.
You got this.

23:21.410 --> 23:23.064
Follow through. Follow through.

23:24.994 --> 23:27.259
Go. Get it, sweetie.
- Come on, D'Asia.

23:27.343 --> 23:29.459
TRACY: You go, girl, D'Asia!

23:30.101 --> 23:31.875
HELEN: You can do it.

23:33.407 --> 23:35.156
[whistle shrills]

23:35.767 --> 23:37.033
Yes!

23:37.035 --> 23:40.192
SPECTATORS:
[cheering, applauding]

23:40.926 --> 23:42.926
Get it, girl. Get in there.

23:42.928 --> 23:44.688
PATRICK: [laughing]

23:44.690 --> 23:47.104
Damn it, Patrick,
it's 4:20... I have to go.

23:47.106 --> 23:48.814
Why don't you just take my car,

23:48.816 --> 23:51.275
then you can stay an extra ten
minutes before leaving, okay?

23:51.851 --> 23:52.969
TRACY: I...

23:52.971 --> 23:55.856
I can't. My license
was suspended.

23:55.858 --> 23:58.636
I like to see my grandbaby play.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.526
You gonna be all right?

24:04.933 --> 24:07.736
Hey, Patrick, those chili Fritos
are not agreein' with my stomach.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.097
You gotta take
over for a second.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.537
Okay. All right, coach.

24:10.539 --> 24:12.957
She's wonderful, isn't she?

24:14.658 --> 24:16.645
PATRICK: All right, team,
let's go, let's go!

24:18.163 --> 24:20.298
Look, there has to be a coach.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.840
I mean, I guess somebody
has to be the responsible adult, right?

24:24.970 --> 24:26.595
What are you doing?
Don't you have somewhere to go?

24:26.597 --> 24:28.743
I'm just a junky thief, right?

24:28.745 --> 24:32.338
I smoked all that
crack by myself, huh?

24:33.134 --> 24:34.707
Come on, baby, get
back on offense.

24:34.709 --> 24:36.613
Why don't you just knock it off
and get outta here?

24:36.615 --> 24:38.399
Patrick, I blew people

24:38.401 --> 24:42.290
to make money to support us
and now I don't belong?

24:45.323 --> 24:47.533
Ignore me if you want,

24:47.535 --> 24:49.589
but whatever you think of me,
you're the same.

24:49.831 --> 24:51.860
And no matter how much
money your family has,

24:51.860 --> 24:53.425
you're still an addict.

25:01.089 --> 25:05.092
SPECTATORS: [cheering, shouting]

25:05.927 --> 25:07.125
[whistle shrills]

25:07.127 --> 25:08.903
[silently]
Yeah.

25:09.285 --> 25:10.767
I did everything you told me to do.

25:10.769 --> 25:14.096
I explained how we can use the
ugly Black woman momentum

25:14.098 --> 25:15.559
while you're sidelined

25:15.567 --> 25:18.477
to bolster some talented,
non-threatening candidate

25:18.479 --> 25:20.023
and Greg does what
he always does.

25:20.025 --> 25:21.851
He just frickin'
switched it up on me.

25:21.853 --> 25:22.889
I just don't get it.

25:22.891 --> 25:25.433
It's like they don't care that
they're alienating the viewers.

25:25.517 --> 25:26.883
I'm... I'm concerned.

25:26.885 --> 25:28.689
Can you please put
that bat down?

25:28.691 --> 25:30.166
My gosh.
- Who'd they get?

25:30.893 --> 25:33.194
They got her.

25:34.863 --> 25:36.946
A Latina?
- Mm-hm.

25:36.948 --> 25:38.907
They wanna put JLo Junior in my chair?

25:38.909 --> 25:41.221
Oh, baby, I'm not
worried at all.

25:41.346 --> 25:42.533
Really?
You are not worried

25:42.535 --> 25:44.355
because have you frickin'
looked at this girl?

25:44.357 --> 25:45.958
I mean, she's hot.

25:46.263 --> 25:47.808
I mean, if I had a "lick her" license,

25:47.810 --> 25:50.329
I would totally be into that.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.594
If you chiseled off all that
Maybelline off her face,

25:52.596 --> 25:54.215
you couldn't even tell
which race she is.

25:54.217 --> 25:57.306
She's all make-up
and no substance.

25:57.308 --> 26:00.672
Why, because she's beautiful
and young, she's not qualified?

26:00.697 --> 26:01.879
Okay.

26:03.476 --> 26:06.477
Oh, she's done news four
years and has anchored twice.

26:06.479 --> 26:08.246
All make-up, no substance.

26:08.248 --> 26:10.532
Well, you've gotta
start somewhere, chickie.

26:10.534 --> 26:11.742
Baby, she is the dress

26:11.744 --> 26:14.152
that you... you buy and wear once

26:14.154 --> 26:16.871
and then take back to
the store the next day.

26:16.873 --> 26:18.342
She's a return item.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.116
[knocking at door]

26:20.358 --> 26:21.714
Hopefully.

26:31.885 --> 26:34.232
Hey.
- Hey.

26:34.234 --> 26:36.071
[laughs]
KARA: Who's this?

26:36.766 --> 26:38.898
She is here to
pick up my iPhone.

26:39.181 --> 26:40.976
Yeah, she works for one
of those you break it,

26:40.977 --> 26:43.056
we fix it mobile services.
- Oh.

26:43.058 --> 26:44.324
And since my car is trashed,

26:44.325 --> 26:46.465
she is here.
- That's unique.

26:46.467 --> 26:48.760
Yeah, I can fix anything.

26:48.762 --> 26:51.207
Yeah.
- Oh. Do you have a business card?

26:51.209 --> 26:52.877
Well, yeah, you know, she has a card

26:52.879 --> 26:55.120
and a "lick her" license.
- Oh.

26:55.135 --> 26:58.580
Yeah. Mm-hm.
- Oh.
- I'm outta cards, but I'm sure

26:58.582 --> 27:00.582
Miss Paul can give
you my information.

27:00.584 --> 27:02.932
Okay. - Mm-hm.
- That'd be great.

27:03.159 --> 27:04.282
Well, out you go.

27:04.284 --> 27:07.299
Got a show to produce.
- I absolutely do.
It was nice meeting you.

27:07.354 --> 27:09.491
Oh, nice meeting you.
- Good luck.

27:09.493 --> 27:11.678
Thank you.
- You, too.

27:13.946 --> 27:16.196
"Lick her" license?
- Hm...

27:18.914 --> 27:20.335
Where's my money?

27:21.354 --> 27:23.285
Okay, so here's the deal.

27:23.287 --> 27:25.020
I have a messenger en route

27:25.022 --> 27:27.590
with $5,000 in cash

27:27.592 --> 27:30.105
and if you're cool with that amount,
then we've got a deal.

27:30.952 --> 27:32.358
That's not the number we discussed.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.038
Well, that's all I can afford, so...

27:37.370 --> 27:39.278
This is your house, right?

27:39.559 --> 27:40.715
[laughing]

27:41.374 --> 27:44.131
Yes, okay, I have
expensive taste, Cece,

27:44.133 --> 27:46.662
but I also have to
take care of my...

27:46.664 --> 27:48.419
my drug addict brother,
my sick mother,

27:48.421 --> 27:50.147
my... my niece, her two kids.

27:51.023 --> 27:52.717
Cece, you're just gonna have to
get in line because I don't have

27:52.719 --> 27:55.118
$25,000 to give you, okay?

27:55.283 --> 27:57.588
I have $5,000, so...

27:58.591 --> 28:01.325
deal with it.
- Okay. All right.

28:02.595 --> 28:05.068
$25,000 is my blessing.

28:06.366 --> 28:07.982
So here's what's gonna happen.

28:07.984 --> 28:10.768
I know you get paid
every two weeks, so...

28:10.770 --> 28:13.057
you are gonna pay me,
every two weeks,

28:13.059 --> 28:15.637
$5,000 in cash

28:15.777 --> 28:17.658
until I get back to my blessing.

28:18.411 --> 28:21.536
I just told you everything
I have to deal with and you
still wanna extort me?

28:21.832 --> 28:23.316
It's the best I can do.

28:24.617 --> 28:27.385
So, now you deal with it.

28:35.909 --> 28:38.456
Thank you.
- The messenger's stuck in traffic.

28:38.458 --> 28:41.547
Oh. I see you're readin'
WEB Du Bois.

28:41.822 --> 28:44.150
What do you know about Du Bois?
[laughing]

28:44.152 --> 28:45.284
What do I know?

28:45.331 --> 28:47.386
A hell of a lot more than you do.
- Hm...

28:47.425 --> 28:48.643
I promise you that.

28:48.645 --> 28:49.613
I bet you don't even know

28:49.615 --> 28:51.860
what the "W", the "E"
or the "B" stand for.

28:51.862 --> 28:54.618
William Edward Burghardt.
Don't try me.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.347
You're not gonna extort me
and insult my intelligence.

28:56.349 --> 28:58.399
I'm not trying to
insult your intelligence.

28:58.553 --> 29:01.653
I'm just questioning your choice
of reading material.

29:01.655 --> 29:03.115
Are you gonna go there
with me?

29:03.117 --> 29:05.545
[laughing] Bring it.

29:06.243 --> 29:08.633
Oh, it's already been broughten.

29:10.861 --> 29:11.976
GREG's VOICE: Look, Kara,

29:11.978 --> 29:13.814
I know you're in Mary Jane's corner,

29:13.884 --> 29:16.715
but you need to make sure
Marisol is ready to go.

29:16.717 --> 29:19.050
KARA's VOICE: Greg, of course.

29:19.052 --> 29:21.763
I am a professional, okay?
All good.

29:21.765 --> 29:23.653
GREG' VOICE:
Great. I just wanna make sure

29:23.655 --> 29:26.174
we're all on the same page.
- KARA's VOICE: We are.

29:26.418 --> 29:29.758
See, we are dealing with
the push-button generation.

29:30.467 --> 29:33.114
Instant gratification is
America's newest export.

29:33.412 --> 29:34.949
All right, these kids these days,

29:34.951 --> 29:36.405
the only thing they're
bringing to the table is

29:36.407 --> 29:38.222
expectations and entitlement,

29:38.224 --> 29:41.443
that's it, and that's a direct
result of the culture.

29:41.445 --> 29:45.163
Well, that'd sound
great in a term paper.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.919
But the truth is

29:47.921 --> 29:51.538
centuries of slavery
followed by systematic

29:51.540 --> 29:55.522
terrorism, discrimination,
segregation and so on,

29:55.645 --> 29:58.754
now that's what
impedes the Black man

29:58.756 --> 30:00.521
from his success.

30:00.623 --> 30:01.662
Excuses.

30:01.982 --> 30:03.792
Excuses!
That's all it is.

30:04.129 --> 30:06.840
Okay, yes, I will be
the first to admit that

30:06.842 --> 30:09.517
there are countless atrocities
in our past...

30:09.519 --> 30:11.071
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
- ...that have prevented us

30:11.073 --> 30:13.157
from competing, truly competing on

30:13.159 --> 30:15.529
a level playing field.
I will give you that.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.610
However, can we both
be honest here?

30:18.612 --> 30:22.030
Some of us are just... lazy.

30:22.032 --> 30:25.566
Okay, there, I said it.
Some of us are just lazy.

30:25.568 --> 30:27.136
That was actually quite freeing.

30:27.138 --> 30:29.153
You should say it with me.

30:29.155 --> 30:30.560
Oh, yeah,

30:30.874 --> 30:33.607
lazy Negro,

30:34.415 --> 30:36.427
lazy Negro.

30:36.783 --> 30:39.798
[chomping popcorn]

30:39.800 --> 30:42.801
It's easy to criticize
when you've made it.

30:42.803 --> 30:44.886
Unh-unh, you're not
gonna put that on me.

30:44.888 --> 30:46.155
No, sir.

30:47.664 --> 30:49.643
Cece, that's you.

30:49.645 --> 30:52.591
That's all you. Yeah.

30:52.979 --> 30:55.647
Because instead of figuring out
how to make your own money,

30:55.649 --> 30:57.350
oh, it's just easier to take mine...

30:57.352 --> 30:59.399
'cause you're lazy.

30:59.903 --> 31:03.238
You's a lazy-ass Negro, okay?

31:03.474 --> 31:06.107
And... and... and you, like
every other warped person,

31:06.109 --> 31:09.106
uses religion to lead the
charge of their crimes.

31:09.579 --> 31:10.755
Lazy Negro.

31:12.067 --> 31:14.282
Look, this popcorn is salty.

31:14.526 --> 31:17.518
Can I have, uh,
another glass of water.
- No.

31:17.787 --> 31:19.134
[chomping]

31:20.526 --> 31:23.175
Good evening,
I'm Marisol Esparza.

31:23.221 --> 31:24.647
Welcome to "Prime Time."

31:25.216 --> 31:28.286
Mary Jane Paul is still at home
recovering and I promise to

31:28.288 --> 31:31.382
do my very best to hold down
the fort until she returns.

31:31.384 --> 31:33.217
Get well soon, Mary Jane.

31:33.241 --> 31:34.764
Ooh, she's cute.

31:36.018 --> 31:39.151
You can wait in the car.
- Don't be mad at me because

31:39.153 --> 31:40.125
my eyes work.

31:40.127 --> 31:43.876
...there'll be effective actions
on immigration in a speech
tomorrow night.

31:44.902 --> 31:46.230
Look at that outfit.

31:46.232 --> 31:48.132
Try and get me to wear
that tacky-ass jacket.

31:48.134 --> 31:50.917
CECILIA: Hm, that jacket is even cute.

31:52.567 --> 31:55.323
Fetching.
- Did you just say "fetching"?

31:55.407 --> 31:58.912
CECILIA: Yes, as in alluring,
attractive,

31:58.914 --> 32:00.687
fetching, as in...

32:00.882 --> 32:02.849
her jacket is fetching.

32:02.851 --> 32:05.634
[laughing]
Hmph.

32:05.948 --> 32:09.831
Listen to her. She's boring.
She's like human ambiance.

32:10.206 --> 32:12.299
Why are you assaulting
that girl's game?

32:12.556 --> 32:15.158
Assault? What year is this again?

32:15.378 --> 32:17.182
Hm, I didn't know
you spoke "deflection."

32:17.184 --> 32:19.674
I am not deflecting, okay?

32:20.132 --> 32:23.384
Remember, she's keeping my chair
warm, not the other way around.

32:23.469 --> 32:26.455
I'm not worried.
- Well, you should be worried.

32:26.845 --> 32:29.329
The growth of the
Hispanic population is

32:29.331 --> 32:32.845
changing the face of this
country as we speak...

32:33.468 --> 32:36.434
52 million Americans of Latin

32:36.436 --> 32:38.663
descent in this
country, honey.

32:38.899 --> 32:41.670
In the next 30 years, we're all
gonna be wearing cowboy boots

32:41.672 --> 32:44.924
and eatin' corn on the
cob with mayonnaise.

32:44.926 --> 32:46.048
[laughing]

32:46.050 --> 32:48.693
I'm not worried.
Do you know why?

32:48.695 --> 32:51.818
Hablo español.
- Please, just because you

32:51.820 --> 32:54.198
speaks Spanish don't
make you one of them.

32:54.887 --> 32:57.057
[laughing]

32:57.059 --> 33:00.252
Woo, she got you, shook up.

33:00.254 --> 33:01.410
No. No.

33:01.412 --> 33:04.268
I knew it. You know,
ain't nothing worse

33:04.270 --> 33:06.028
than underestimating
your opponent.

33:06.112 --> 33:07.895
SNC treated me like that.

33:07.897 --> 33:10.031
Thinkin' they could buy me.

33:10.033 --> 33:11.304
Well, you cashed the check,

33:11.306 --> 33:14.829
so one could conclude
that they did buy you.

33:14.831 --> 33:16.289
Oh, funny.

33:16.712 --> 33:19.126
Yeah, but while you standin' here

33:19.204 --> 33:21.578
crackin' on old Cece,

33:21.795 --> 33:24.430
that pretty Latin honey,

33:24.570 --> 33:28.241
she's probably takin' Instagram
photos in your chair.

33:29.054 --> 33:32.282
[chuckling]

33:32.471 --> 33:33.586
Ooh.

33:33.923 --> 33:35.751
Yes, Miss Paul,

33:35.967 --> 33:39.283
that's the
face of the future...

33:39.979 --> 33:41.645
right there.

33:41.647 --> 33:42.923
You know something?

33:43.426 --> 33:45.192
If you want your job back,

33:45.544 --> 33:47.144
you'd better get up and go get it,

33:48.043 --> 33:49.598
'cause in a minute,

33:50.344 --> 33:53.198
you ain't gonna be able to get
her outta your chair.

33:54.290 --> 33:55.522
[doorbell ringing]

33:55.524 --> 33:56.727
Okay, it's time
for you to go.

33:56.729 --> 33:58.133

Here to pick up D'Asia?
- Yeah, school's tomorrow.

34:43.717 --> 34:46.260
If she doesn't get to bed early,
it'll be a long morning.

34:46.262 --> 34:48.985
Oh, Patrick, I didn't
know you were here.

34:49.266 --> 34:51.743
I just got some ice cream for the kids.
Do you want some?

34:51.782 --> 34:54.141
No, thank you, no.
I'm just here for D'Asia.

34:54.143 --> 34:55.433
Oh, thank you, baby.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.189
Hey, you looked good out
there with those kids.

34:58.191 --> 34:59.386
It looked like you were havin' fun.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.966
Yeah, I like being on the court
coaching, this kinda thing.

35:02.114 --> 35:05.731
I'd like to spend more time
with D'Asia, but this job, Lordy.

35:05.949 --> 35:08.566
They've got me on call for
25 lousy hours a week

35:08.568 --> 35:10.786
and never tell me when I'm working,
so I can't plan my schedule

35:10.788 --> 35:13.352
and it's tough finding
sitters at the last minute.

35:13.493 --> 35:15.547
Oh, here it comes. Now,

35:16.407 --> 35:19.493
Patrick, you know
I love my grandbaby. But...

35:19.727 --> 35:23.375
I'm older now and I just
don't see myself as a nanny.

35:23.377 --> 35:25.485
I'm not asking you to, mama.

35:26.287 --> 35:28.401
[sighing]

35:28.701 --> 35:30.343
Dad...

35:32.392 --> 35:35.688
You've been asking me for years
if I needed help and I've been...

35:36.596 --> 35:38.593
too proud to take it, but...

35:40.200 --> 35:43.450
I'm ready for you to actually
make that call for me.

35:43.950 --> 35:45.561
I need a job.

35:45.695 --> 35:48.148
Something steady so I can be
there for D'Asia and

35:48.649 --> 35:51.611
I don't care, really,
what it is. I just...

35:52.416 --> 35:54.974
Anything you can do,
Dad, would be great.

35:55.615 --> 36:00.548
PAUL: Oh... Oh... Oh...

36:02.151 --> 36:03.936
[patting Patrick's back]

36:03.938 --> 36:07.030
Oh... Dad. What?

36:08.461 --> 36:11.076
Are you okay? Are
you okay, Dad?

36:11.193 --> 36:13.421
I think I'll join your dad.

36:13.953 --> 36:17.734
He's having an emotional moment.
- Oh.

36:23.492 --> 36:25.433
[sighing]

36:25.435 --> 36:28.070
How come you didn't fight
Like this for me and Naima?

36:30.036 --> 36:31.857
Huh, what are you talking about?

36:31.859 --> 36:35.209
You weren't there for me and Naima.

36:35.538 --> 36:37.387
You were always gone.. some club,

36:37.389 --> 36:39.548
some party, some woman.

36:40.236 --> 36:42.666
You never had time for us.

36:43.096 --> 36:45.721
Somebody's gotta make the money, right?
Remember that?

36:46.066 --> 36:47.714
Niecy, come on.

36:49.768 --> 36:51.424
[sighing]

36:52.405 --> 36:54.115
I was going through some problems.
You know that.

36:54.117 --> 36:55.643
Yeah, and I watched you struggle...

36:58.811 --> 37:01.658
trying to do
everything yourself...

37:02.866 --> 37:05.390
not asking anybody for anything

37:05.869 --> 37:08.080
because you wanted
to be independent.

37:09.756 --> 37:11.748
And I remember thinking like, wow,

37:12.107 --> 37:13.966
my dad, he may not be rollin',

37:14.857 --> 37:17.482
but at least he's
trying to make it on his own.

37:18.602 --> 37:20.375
But that turned out to be some BS

37:20.375 --> 37:22.486
because now that you're coaching D'Asia,

37:23.029 --> 37:24.553
you're suddenly super dad.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.553
No, it's not that.
- And you're gonna ask
Grandpa for a job

37:28.303 --> 37:30.532
so you can be
the perfect father for her.

37:30.534 --> 37:32.828
No, it's not...
- Me and Naima,

37:33.548 --> 37:35.783
we could have
used the perfect father, too.

37:37.334 --> 37:39.037
It would've been great.
