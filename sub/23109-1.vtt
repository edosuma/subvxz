What are you doing?

38:43.655 --> 38:44.854
Put it down. Put it down.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.329
- She'll never
let you take it back.

She'll never leave you alone
until you just break!

38:56.568 --> 38:59.035
This is the only way out,
Kristen.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.805
- It's the only way I can do it.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.689
- You shouldn't be here.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.524
You shouldn't be here.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.994
- This doesn't make sense.

39:59.497 --> 40:01.931
Everyone thought
it was because of...

40:01.933 --> 40:05.168
that video or Amber...

40:05.170 --> 40:08.037
and that she
couldn't deal with it.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.773
But there was something else,

40:09.775 --> 40:11.508
something she wouldn't tell me.

40:13.811 --> 40:15.145
- I don't know

you wanna talk about right now,
but I have to ask you.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.689
- I already told your partner
everything that I know.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.193

40:32.963 --> 40:35.965

what she was doing

40:35.967 --> 40:37.867
and who she was doing it with.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.740
We'll talk later,

40:43.742 --> 40:45.775

she was in Nicole's, too.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.027

I'm saying this,

42:13.732 --> 42:15.565
You didn't even know her,
Kristen.

Morgan's profile online,

42:18.770 --> 42:22.839
that it was still up,
and she posted on it,

42:22.841 --> 42:27.310

and Nicole did, too,

42:27.312 --> 42:29.045

her parents were or where--

school said all kinds of shit.

if any of it was true.

at St. Francis?

they must know something.

They never met in real life.

he had a crush on her,

55:58.556 --> 56:00.823

to send him a picture.

You can guess what kind.

56:07.530 --> 56:12.468
She just wanted to have
someone in her life so badly.

56:13.903 --> 56:16.872
- And this boy, whoever it was,

56:16.874 --> 56:19.808
he was the one that leaked it
to the rest of the school.

- Her grandmother
lost faith in us...

56:59.115 --> 57:01.884

57:03.720 --> 57:05.921

Morgan was dead.

of fortuneteller.

someplace safe

58:09.253 --> 58:10.986
What do we do, text him?

58:10.988 --> 58:12.721
- Yeah, just--
just fucking text him.

58:12.723 --> 58:14.656
I want to know what he's doing.

58:20.196 --> 58:21.864
- Unlock the goddamn door!

58:24.634 --> 58:26.668
All right.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.270
Found out
something you want to know,

58:28.272 --> 58:30.572
but first, tell me what
you've been hiding about Nicole.

58:32.575 --> 58:33.609
Huh?

58:33.611 --> 58:34.943
- Tell him.

58:34.945 --> 58:38.614
- Amber and Nicole
weren't crazy, okay?

58:38.616 --> 58:41.016
S-Something was after them.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.918
- Something named Morgan?

58:44.287 --> 58:45.921
- How did you know that?

58:45.923 --> 58:48.524
- This was Amber's.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.125
Okay, it says spirits

58:50.127 --> 58:51.994
can't cross anything
made of cold iron.

58:51.996 --> 58:54.196
That's why old cemeteries
have iron fences.

It keeps the dead inside.

58:55.799 --> 58:57.933
Now, Amber, she used nails.

58:57.935 --> 59:00.035
She drew shit in iron filings.

59:00.037 --> 59:02.905

You didn't know
what you were doing.

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:36.837
- She's right behind you.

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:40.341
- No, Jake!
- [ gunshot ]

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:41.509

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:11.272

01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:12.873
It's all right.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.147
No.

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:25.419
I would never wish this
upon you or him.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:30.224
This vengeful spirit
is not my granddaughter.

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:33.394
This is not what she would want.

01:20:33.396 --> 01:20:37.164
I don't know
if I can free you from her,

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:39.166
but I want to try.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.136
It'll be painful,

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:45.372
but in the end,
you won't see her anymore.

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:48.409
- What about Morgan?

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:50.311
What's gonna happen to her?

01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:55.282
- If you don't shut her out,
she will destroy you.

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:58.018
- I can't just leave her.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:01.388
I need to help her.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:02.890
I have come this far.

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:04.191
I need to help her.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.529
Please.

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:18.272

01:22:05.154 --> 01:22:07.421
No. [ panting ] Go away.

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.933

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:19.626

- Honey, can I get you anything?

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:22.649
Will you at least talk to me?

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.655
- We never should have left her.

01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:30.190
- [ sighs ]

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:36.130
There was--There was no way
we could have known.

- She was our girl, Michael.

01:25:43.139 --> 01:25:44.738
[ sobs ]

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.507
Our little baby girl.
