00:02.580 --> 00:06.480
<b><i>Next is the continuation of 
our report on the UMAs,</i></b>

00:06.480 --> 00:09.230
<b><i>or Unidentified Mysterious Animals, 
that have recently been sighted.</i></b>

00:09.890 --> 00:15.340
<b><i>The difference between this and our previous 
report is the increasing number of victims,</i></b>

00:15.340 --> 00:19.410
<b><i>and the amount of evidence supporting 
the existence of these creatures.</i></b>

00:19.740 --> 00:23.790
<b><i>In any case, many of the witnesses are 
active members of the police force.</i></b>

00:23.790 --> 00:26.070
<b><i>And over half of the officers</i></b>

00:26.070 --> 00:30.550
<b><i>who have rushed to the scenes have 
been killed by these creatures.</i></b>

00:30.980 --> 00:34.920
<b><i>These are images of unidentified creatures 
that have been attacking the police.</i></b>

00:35.510 --> 00:40.010
<b><i>You can see the victims on the 
ground at the creatures' feet.</i></b>

00:41.390 --> 00:45.810
<b><i>What we know is that all these creatures 
are violent, capable of speech,</i></b>

00:45.810 --> 00:48.810
<b><i>and show no fear of humans.</i></b>

00:49.360 --> 00:52.700
<b><i>A prime example is this interview 
with the lion man of Nevaska.</i></b>

00:53.140 --> 00:56.950
<b><i>He spoke at length of a crude theory 
about the existence of a kingdom.</i></b>

00:57.700 --> 01:02.480
<b><i>The woman interviewing him listened 
patiently to what he had to say,</i></b>

01:02.480 --> 01:06.960
<b><i>but eventually, she asked the 
question on every viewer's mind.</i></b>

01:07.820 --> 01:11.630
<b><i>Can you prove that you 
truly are what you claim?</i></b>

01:12.920 --> 01:16.030
<b><i>Those were her last words.</i></b>

01:20.400 --> 01:22.570
<b><i>So far, the unidentified creatures</i></b>

01:22.570 --> 01:26.120
<b><i>have only appeared on the Yorbian continent.</i></b>

01:26.120 --> 01:28.910
<b><i>But it seems likely that they 
will continue to spread,</i></b>

01:28.910 --> 01:33.150
<b><i>and no effective method of dealing 
with them has been found.</i></b>

01:33.560 --> 01:34.740
<b>Sorry for the wait.</b>

01:36.730 --> 01:38.990
<b>Okay, let's go.</b>

02:59.030 --> 03:04.030
<b>A x Lawless x Home</b>

03:09.080 --> 03:11.570
<b>They're known as Chimera Ants.</b>

03:11.960 --> 03:13.260
<b>I know.</b>

03:13.260 --> 03:15.170
<b>They became that way after mixing with humans.</b>

03:15.630 --> 03:20.110
<b>Working backwards from the dates and 
locations of sightings and police reports,</b>

03:20.110 --> 03:22.580
<b>they probably originated in the Balsa Islands.</b>

03:22.580 --> 03:25.680
<b>Lots of strange nations are in that area.</b>

03:25.970 --> 03:28.560
<b>You shouldn't be talking about 
how strange other people are.</b>

03:28.870 --> 03:31.200
<b>But they were once ants...</b>

03:31.200 --> 03:34.060
<b>So they should just stay close to their nest.</b>

03:34.570 --> 03:37.430
<b>Why come all the way out here?</b>

03:37.830 --> 03:38.990
<b>No idea.</b>

03:38.990 --> 03:42.660
<b>Maybe they were just wandering, or perhaps 
they were drawn to the smell of garbage.</b>

03:42.660 --> 03:44.570
<b>It can't be a coincidence.</b>

03:44.960 --> 03:48.260
<b>Both NGL and East Gorteau are nations</b>

03:48.260 --> 03:50.870
<b>that share no information with the outside world.</b>

03:51.230 --> 03:53.970
<b>Just like this place.</b>

03:53.970 --> 03:58.340
<b>That makes it easier for them to invade.</b>

04:04.660 --> 04:06.350
<b>It's been quite a long time.</b>

04:07.120 --> 04:09.350
<b>The place hasn't changed...</b>

04:18.720 --> 04:20.110
<b>What's the situation?</b>

04:20.970 --> 04:25.730
<b>Between the victims and martyrs, 
we're seeing over three hundred dead.</b>

04:26.250 --> 04:30.120
<b>Bombs have no effect, so we can't fight back.</b>

04:32.450 --> 04:36.980
<b>The council is still arguing about 
how to classify the dead.</b>

04:37.550 --> 04:39.130
<b>What do you mean?</b>

04:45.650 --> 04:48.760
<b>A few days ago, this was an ordinary human.</b>

04:48.760 --> 04:50.710
<b>The Ants did this?</b>

04:50.710 --> 04:53.020
<b>Looks dead to me.</b>

04:53.440 --> 04:55.140
<b>What's the problem?</b>

04:56.410 --> 04:59.650
<b>Some are alive and working with the Ants.</b>

05:00.340 --> 05:02.690
<b>And all of them look like monsters.</b>

05:03.690 --> 05:06.910
<b>The council's debate is whether 
to declare them dead based on</b>

05:06.910 --> 05:12.240
<b>whether or not there's a way to 
restore them to their original forms.</b>

05:13.710 --> 05:15.620
<b>They can't avenge them because</b>

05:15.620 --> 05:19.810
<b>they're too busy arguing over 
whether they're dead or mutated?</b>

05:26.260 --> 05:28.610
<b>Nothing's changed.</b>

05:28.610 --> 05:31.100
<b>They always lose sight of what's important.</b>

05:31.980 --> 05:34.080
<b>We're going to do things our way.</b>

05:34.870 --> 05:37.560
<b>If anyone interferes, we'll take them down.</b>

05:38.610 --> 05:39.960
<b>Don't worry.</b>

05:41.290 --> 05:43.730
<b>Before the day is out,</b>

05:44.710 --> 05:46.800
<b>we'll exterminate this so-called Queen.</b>

05:49.970 --> 05:52.080
<b>I am the Queen.</b>

05:52.780 --> 05:54.080
<b>I repeat.</b>

05:54.600 --> 05:56.080
<b>Surrender.</b>

05:56.870 --> 05:59.760
<b>Those who resist will be executed.</b>

06:00.220 --> 06:04.850
<b>The chosen will live in paradise for eternity!</b>

06:08.110 --> 06:10.480
<b>Our mother's greatest flaw</b>

06:10.480 --> 06:14.140
<b>was that she could only produce soldiers</b>

06:14.140 --> 06:16.630
<b>through the archaic and inefficient laying of eggs.</b>

06:17.370 --> 06:19.600
<b>Her sole achievement</b>

06:21.280 --> 06:23.330
<b>was giving birth to me.</b>

06:24.760 --> 06:25.760
<b>Stop...</b>

<b>Kill me!</b>

06:52.610 --> 06:53.550
<b>Bingo.</b>

<b>Chosen one, welcome to paradise.</b>

06:57.750 --> 07:01.310
<b>Swear eternal fealty to the Queen.</b>

07:03.740 --> 07:06.070
<b>I am the Queen.</b>

07:06.170 --> 07:13.070
<b>Sexy Stinger of Rebirth</b>

07:08.490 --> 07:11.740
<b>With my Queen Shot, I shall control the world.</b>

07:14.500 --> 07:16.080
<b>Let's go through the front door.</b>

07:16.920 --> 07:18.860
<b>No objection here...</b>

07:24.540 --> 07:26.090
<b>No one's around.</b>

07:26.810 --> 07:29.480
<b>Are they inviting us in?</b>

07:30.010 --> 07:31.840
<b>Then I'll go this way.</b>

07:32.280 --> 07:33.960
<b>I'll take this way.</b>

07:34.710 --> 07:36.040
<b>We're splitting up?</b>

07:36.040 --> 07:39.600
<b>Of course... It's a race to see 
who'll kill the Queen.</b>

07:40.030 --> 07:43.920
<b>I imagine you'd prefer to hide 
your abilities from us.</b>

07:44.320 --> 07:47.150
<b>Kill anything that attacks you.</b>

07:47.150 --> 07:51.240
<b>If you kill the Queen, you're the interim boss.</b>

07:51.980 --> 07:52.910
<b>Understood.</b>

07:53.840 --> 07:54.740
<b>Start!</b>

07:58.210 --> 07:59.750
<b>They've scattered.</b>

08:00.290 --> 08:07.640
<b>From their footsteps, I can sense 
that these intruders are special.</b>

08:07.640 --> 08:11.010
<b>They are accustomed to living in the wild.</b>

08:11.800 --> 08:13.160
<b>Are they strong?</b>

08:13.160 --> 08:14.290
<b>Yes.</b>

08:15.460 --> 08:17.640
<b>Then go and greet them.</b>

08:17.640 --> 08:22.550
<b>But then, no one will be here to guard you.</b>

08:22.550 --> 08:24.420
<b>If you're worried about me,</b>

08:24.420 --> 08:27.940
<b>capture the enemy and hurry back.</b>

<b>I have faith in you, Pike.</b>

<b>Now, then...</b>

08:51.630 --> 08:54.140
<b>My mother's greatest misfortune</b>

08:54.140 --> 08:57.500
<b>was that she never experienced

09:10.600 --> 09:12.360
<b>You're no fun...</b>

09:13.520 --> 09:15.240
<b>Let me hold you.</b>

09:53.310 --> 09:55.720
<b>its ancestral lands, the Gyudondond.</b>

09:56.270 --> 10:00.800
<b>When Gyudondond males reach the age of three,</b>

10:00.800 --> 10:03.780
<b>needles are used to puncture holes in their body.</b>

10:03.780 --> 10:07.030
<b>Depending on the holes' size and shape,</b>

10:07.030 --> 10:10.320
<b>and the movements the Gyudondond 
make, they can produce sound.</b>

10:10.870 --> 10:14.100
<b>Before fighting rival tribes or wild animals,</b>

10:14.100 --> 10:18.470
<b>they would play a battle song using 
their own bodies as instruments.</b>

10:18.840 --> 10:21.880
<b>They are known as the Bapu, dancing warriors.</b>

10:20.760 --> 10:24.590
<b>Bapu

<b>the sound produced, the stronger

10:28.040 --> 10:31.510
<b>The most skilled Bapu are treated as gods,</b>

<b>and hold more influence than the elders.</b>

<b>that you will not best me.</b>

<b>You must be a Manipulator.</b>

<b>I can tell because, once you placed

15:48.120 --> 15:50.720
<b>Autopilot on.</b>

15:54.900 --> 15:57.260
<b>S-So much aura...</b>

15:58.130 --> 16:00.600
<b>Enemy identified.</b>

16:00.960 --> 16:02.600
<b>Eliminating now.</b>

16:03.000 --> 16:04.250
<b>Go, Pell!</b>

16:04.250 --> 16:06.660
<b>Aim for his leg! Remove the antenna!</b>

16:18.130 --> 16:19.950
<b>Mission complete.</b>

16:19.950 --> 16:22.120
<b>Autopilot disengaging.</b>

16:22.700 --> 16:24.260
<b>Powering off.</b>

16:28.440 --> 16:29.570
<b>Ow...</b>

16:29.570 --> 16:31.420
<b>I already feel it...</b>

16:31.420 --> 16:35.170
<b>I'll be down with muscle aches 
for two or three days.</b>

16:35.880 --> 16:38.720
<b>That's why I hate using this!</b>

16:39.150 --> 16:43.140
<b>It makes me stronger, but there's a hefty price.</b>

16:43.670 --> 16:45.750
<b>And I remember nothing that happened,</b>

16:45.750 --> 16:48.110
<b>so I don't feel like I've accomplished anything.</b>

16:52.200 --> 16:55.410
<b>You have considerable power for a lady.</b>

16:55.710 --> 16:58.910
<b><i>Where was she hiding that vacuum cleaner?</i></b>

17:01.050 --> 17:02.820
<b><i>His thread is strong.</i></b>

17:02.820 --> 17:05.370
<b><i>If I get caught in it, I won't be able to escape.</i></b>

17:09.010 --> 17:10.810
<b>Where's the Queen?</b>

17:11.780 --> 17:13.050
<b>Rejoice.</b>

17:13.050 --> 17:14.560
<b>She stands before you now.</b>

17:15.210 --> 17:17.010
<b>That's a lame joke.</b>

17:17.880 --> 17:19.680
<b>Huh? A joke?</b>

17:20.460 --> 17:24.060
<b>You have no manners, brat.
This warrants a hefty punishment.</b>

17:24.060 --> 17:26.630
<b>They are but a beast's ramblings.</b>

17:26.630 --> 17:28.960
<b>Then I'll take you up on that.</b>

17:28.960 --> 17:33.070
<b>When I fight, I always carry two antennae.</b>

17:34.520 --> 17:37.410
<b>It sounds like Feitan found the Queen...</b>

17:38.170 --> 17:40.610
<b>How do I kill her first?</b>

17:40.610 --> 17:42.830
<b>What's this? A child?</b>

17:43.500 --> 17:46.830
<b>Hey, little girl, come over here.</b>

17:46.830 --> 17:48.030
<b>I refuse.</b>

17:48.490 --> 17:49.590
<b>Rejected...</b>

17:50.090 --> 17:52.960
<b>Then I'll come to you.</b>

17:55.630 --> 17:58.300
<b>I'm in a hurry right now.</b>

18:04.330 --> 18:06.230
<b>What's that?</b>

18:06.880 --> 18:08.350
<b>Confetti.</b>

18:09.750 --> 18:11.230
<b>Wind!</b>

18:18.600 --> 18:20.740
<b>That didn't even tickle.</b>

18:24.880 --> 18:28.210
<b>Surrounding me with more paper?</b>

18:31.090 --> 18:33.340
<b>You're wasting your time!</b>

18:34.080 --> 18:34.840
<b>Look.</b>

18:36.690 --> 18:40.010
<b>What? You think that means something?</b>

18:40.010 --> 18:42.260
<b>You really are a stupid kid!</b>

18:46.350 --> 18:47.860
<b>Impossible...</b>

18:47.860 --> 18:50.130
<b>This rope is made of steel!</b>

18:50.130 --> 18:53.570
<b>My fan is made of paper.</b>

19:07.500 --> 19:09.120
<b>Meandering Dance</b>

19:08.450 --> 19:10.120
<b><i>Meandering Dance.</i></b>

19:17.970 --> 19:19.130
<b>Look.</b>

19:21.590 --> 19:24.010
<b>Your right arm is next.</b>

19:26.970 --> 19:28.020
<b><i>An umbrella?</i></b>

19:38.430 --> 19:40.150
<b><i>Decent reaction.</i></b>

19:41.180 --> 19:42.820
<b>A hidden blade?</b>

19:43.590 --> 19:46.160
<b>You like hiding things on you, little boy?</b>

19:46.590 --> 19:48.710
<b>As do you.</b>

19:48.710 --> 19:51.090
<b>When an opponent wears baggy clothing,</b>

19:51.090 --> 19:53.920
<b>it's safe to assume they're hiding something.</b>

20:17.900 --> 20:19.550
<b>What's wrong?</b>

20:19.550 --> 20:21.960
<b>Are you not going to continue your attack?</b>

20:22.970 --> 20:27.870
<b>That is the only way to stop my performance.</b>

20:34.560 --> 20:36.540
<b>You'll pay for this!</b>

20:36.540 --> 20:37.410
<b><i>Pike...</i></b>

20:37.410 --> 20:39.610
<b><i>If I get Pike to use his thread 
to tangle up this guy,</i></b>

20:39.610 --> 20:40.760
<b><i>he can't make any sound!</i></b>

20:41.390 --> 20:44.760
<b>Next time, I'll rip you apart!</b>

20:45.950 --> 20:48.390
<b>Your escape is certainly fast...</b>

20:48.990 --> 20:52.600
<b>But not as fast as the speed of sound.</b>

21:14.000 --> 21:16.920
<b><i>Battle Cantabile...</i></b>

21:18.790 --> 21:21.280
<b>Jupiter</b>

21:18.840 --> 21:21.260
<b><i>Jupiter!</i></b>

21:39.860 --> 21:42.270
<b>Crushed to death.</b>

21:42.830 --> 21:46.410
<b>An appropriate death for a bug.</b>

21:51.250 --> 21:55.360
<b>The Phantom Troupe fight to save their home,</b>

21:55.360 --> 21:57.750
<b>Meteor City, from the Chimera Ants.</b>

23:25.200 --> 23:27.910
<b>Next time: Carnage x And x Devastation.</b>

23:27.910 --> 23:29.330

23:32.390 --> 23:34.210
<b>Hint... It was backwards.</b>
