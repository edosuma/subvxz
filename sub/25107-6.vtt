<i>While attempting to bail out</i>
<i>his brother, Buster,</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:20.603
<i>Michael had accidentally bailed out
the family attorney.</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:24.107
- What's it gonna cost to get Buster out?
<i>- </i> I don't know. What's he in for?

00:24.190 --> 00:25.567
- Murder? Manslaughter?
- No. No.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.609
There's no murder.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.195
He tampered with evidence
when Lucille 2 went missing.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.156
- I would say over $50,000.
- Mm-hmm.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.117
Yeah, well, I told you, I'm tapped out.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.494
Couldn't you embe...
borrow from your company?

00:36.578 --> 00:41.082
What are you talking about?
Lucille Austero is a majority shareholder.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.667
We're gonna be under scrutiny.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.296
Doesn't George Michael have a company
that he can em... borrow from?

00:46.379 --> 00:47.547
You need $15,000?

00:47.630 --> 00:51.009
No. No, not at all.
No, please, son, not from you.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.094
I'd never ask you for money. Come on.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.971
And it's <i>50,000</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:57.390
that I'm <i>not </i> asking you for, not 15, okay?

00:57.474 --> 00:59.434
Which I could probably lend you.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.103
- Oh, I don't need it.
- Huh? No? Good. Yeah?

01:02.187 --> 01:03.646
Good, good.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.815
So your Fakeblock's doing well?

01:05.899 --> 01:08.109
<i>George Michael had been</i>
<i>looking for an opportunity</i>

01:08.193 --> 01:10.153
<i>to come clean about Fakeblock...</i>

01:10.236 --> 01:12.739
- Been meaning to ask.
<i>- ...but this wasn't it.</i>

01:12.822 --> 01:15.825
Yeah, well, Fakeblock's money is
all tied up in legalities,

01:15.909 --> 01:17.911
- patenting, marketing.
- Sounds amazing.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.163
Good for you, good for you. Good for him.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.915
We're trying to figure out
the Buster thing.

01:21.998 --> 01:25.668
Well, if we can't use the company money
to get Buster out,

01:25.752 --> 01:28.004
you better figure out a way to do it,
Barry...

01:29.422 --> 01:30.924
or I'll use my own lawyer.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.510
What are you talking about,
another lawyer?

01:33.593 --> 01:35.804
You don't have the courtesy to wait
until I'm disbarred?

01:35.887 --> 01:38.640
Is this a divorce guy? Oh, this hurts.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.517
Give me a second, I'll be all right.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.311
I was gonna use your divorce
to pay off my peekaboo lawyer.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.106
His name is Dustin Radler,
and I haven't hired him,

01:46.189 --> 01:48.942
because technically,
he's given up the rat race.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.152
Oh, God, the giving up the rat race guy?

01:51.236 --> 01:52.570
This is the sand hobo?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.030
Uh, it's just a question.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.865
Are you guys doing something?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.492
Don't say it!

01:57.575 --> 02:00.537
Please, I can't... I can't hear it.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.455
He tickles my fancy.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.582
Your what? Is the...

02:04.666 --> 02:07.460
What part of Mom is the fancy?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.336
You do not want to know
what I'm picturing,

02:09.419 --> 02:11.381
and it's not what you think.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.841
Oh, stop.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.217
We walk on the beach.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.803
We like the feel
of the sand on our feet.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.013
Oh, God, the thought of your feet.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.306
It's fine.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.933
I'm glad you have someone to talk to.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.310
Well, maybe I'll go check on Buster.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.980
Wow.
Mom really has him fancy-whipped, huh?

02:27.063 --> 02:29.607
You don't want to bring another lawyer
into this.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.527
You don't want to go in fully armed,
because the DA,

02:32.610 --> 02:34.863
she's up for reelection,
and she's a killer.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.573
God, I even hate to say her name.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.535
Yeah, Lottie Dottie DA, my asshole.

02:40.618 --> 02:44.706
Okay. When it comes to Buster:
a total press blackout.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.167
Couldn't agree more.
We have to be diligent.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.668
- No media.
- Uh...

02:49.419 --> 02:51.838
are we talking about reality or, uh,

02:51.921 --> 02:54.382
scripted, as well,
because I've got...

02:54.465 --> 02:56.968
Why would there be a scripted
about the family?

02:57.051 --> 02:59.220
Weren't you working on one
with Ron Howard?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.142
You're saying
that's not grandfathered in.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.853
'Cause it was before the murder.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.438
Michael, tell me that movie

03:08.521 --> 03:12.066
you were producing about us
is not still happening.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.360
I do not think that it is. I mean, I...

03:14.444 --> 03:17.906
I gave the releases to Kitty,
but the industry does not move fast.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.950
Well, then, talk to Kitty
and get them back.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.535
Can't. Kitty hates me.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.288
Did you catch this?

03:25.705 --> 03:27.123
Man, that's priceless.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.042
First, you eat it with Buster,

03:29.375 --> 03:31.127
then you step in it with the movie,

03:31.211 --> 03:33.087
and now you're eating
what you stepped in,

03:33.171 --> 03:35.590
because Kitty hates you.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.344
Guess Michael's the geo-bead today.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.304
Did you say "geo-bead"?

03:41.387 --> 03:44.974
Yeah, it's one of Dad's expressions...
When somebody screws up, Dad said it.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.518
One of his "you'll figure it out
someday" expressions.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.187
- Okay.
- Know what? You're lucky,

03:49.270 --> 03:51.606
'cause Kitty's sweet on me,
so I'll go with you.

03:51.689 --> 03:54.442
- No, thank you. Nope.
- I could go. Or just...

03:54.525 --> 03:58.321
Would that be helpful if I did?
Or am I just being a G-O-B?

03:58.404 --> 03:59.656
Uh...

03:59.739 --> 04:01.783
G-O-B spells "Gob," you geo-bead,

04:01.866 --> 04:03.201
so why don't you s... ah.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.662
Well, today's the day.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.706
Why are you even still here?
Go find your wife.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.417
I don't know where she is.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.586
Well, track down the ex-boyfriend.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.255
And take Tonto with you.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.673
Yes, of course, Marky Bark.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.384
From the cuckolding.

04:19.466 --> 04:23.221
I think I might have an idea
of where I can, I think.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.430
- Come on!
- Coming!

04:24.514 --> 04:27.558
<i>And as Tobias rushed off</i>
<i>with his newfound son,</i>

04:27.642 --> 04:29.477
<i>George Michael and his cousin</i>

04:29.560 --> 04:31.729
<i>- caught up.</i>
<i>- </i> I can't believe this is the third

04:31.813 --> 04:33.731
"welcome home from prison" party
we've thrown.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.066
Yeah.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.401
Know what we should do?

04:36.484 --> 04:39.153
Why don't we make out again
and teach them a lesson?

04:39.237 --> 04:42.740
I can't, 'cause my dad's here,
and he thinks I'm still dating Rebel.

04:43.199 --> 04:46.077
And how would our making out
teach them a lesson?

04:46.160 --> 04:49.580
T-Teach Rebel a lesson.
I meant, teach Rebel.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.833
I'm supposed to have
a date with her later.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.127
Wait, so you <i>are </i> still dating her?

04:54.210 --> 04:55.670
What happened to our plan,

04:55.753 --> 04:57.422
where you show up demanding sex
after ghosting her

04:57.505 --> 04:58.798
for two months,
and she breaks up with you?

04:58.881 --> 05:01.634
Didn't I tell you?
She was out of town for two months,

05:01.718 --> 05:04.137
and it looked like I was waiting
for her when she got home,

05:04.220 --> 05:06.222
and she thinks
we're closer than ever now.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.516
I've agreed to go to this barbecue
at her dad's house.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.518
I can't meet her family. I...

05:10.601 --> 05:13.313
Hey, George Michael, uh... Ah, hey.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.690
Did that Murphybrown thing upset you?

05:16.274 --> 05:19.152
- Oh, did that actress die?
- Oh, you, 2015.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.572
Oh, no, this is different.
The, uh... Tobias's friend,

05:22.655 --> 05:24.115
his name is Murphybrown,

05:24.198 --> 05:26.367
and it's more than just his acting friend.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.744
It's his boyfriend.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.995
No, it's his son.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.038
His boyfriend's son.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.957
Oh, I'm sorry, Maeby.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.876
Are you... jealous?

05:35.084 --> 05:36.169
No, of course not.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.880
I mean, the guy grew up
not even knowing his father.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.424
- If anything, I'm... jealous.
- Hmm.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.302
Yeah, that... that is a great word for it.

05:46.679 --> 05:50.558
Did I overhear that Rebel
does not want you to meet her family?

05:50.641 --> 05:52.185
No, it's that they're having

05:52.268 --> 05:55.355
some barbecue thing today
over at her dad's house...

05:55.438 --> 05:57.398
And you were not invited. Ay, ay, ay.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.609
No, I think I could show up.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.819
- She didn't seem into it...
- Well,

06:01.903 --> 06:05.323
I'm the wrong one to ask.
When I was briefly interested

06:05.406 --> 06:06.991
in Rebel, you know,

06:07.075 --> 06:11.287
and even that overstates it,
I failed the Ron test big-time.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.540
Okay? And in fairness to Ron,
I also thought that he was...

06:14.624 --> 06:15.833
Her...

06:17.168 --> 06:18.961
Her lover?

06:20.338 --> 06:21.464
...boss.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.091
But listen, you take your time.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.551
Don't rush trying to fit in
with that crowd.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.179
They're probably looking for a yes-man
or a suck-up.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.597
That's not your style.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.183
No. No, well, I had a great role model.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.393
Aw, bless you.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.228
Yeah, I also had a...

06:35.812 --> 06:36.646
Well, bless you.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.482
If you end up meeting that family,

06:39.565 --> 06:41.192
one good rule to follow is...

06:41.275 --> 06:42.902
- do not bring Tobias.
- Be myself.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.153
Be yourself, George Michael.

06:44.821 --> 06:45.738
George Maharis.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.157
Yes, be George Maharis,
George Michael.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.828
<i>Now, the story of a wealthy family</i>

06:51.911 --> 06:55.081
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

06:55.164 --> 06:56.791
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

07:02.797 --> 07:04.507
<i>It's </i> Arrested Development.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.055
<i>Michael Bluth was taking his brother</i>
<i>to ensure</i>

07:11.139 --> 07:13.933
<i>that Kitty wasn't going to make
a movie about Buster.</i>

07:14.016 --> 07:16.769
- ...eating what you stepped in.
<i>- </i> You made that point.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.271
I had to give her Buster.

07:18.354 --> 07:19.897
The movie couldn't be me
and George Michael.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.524
We were both dating Rebel,

07:21.607 --> 07:23.818
and she didn't know
that he was my son.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.194
- It was a disaster.
- Right.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.489
You didn't know who I was dating,
so you accused me of being the other man.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.950
- Who were you dating?
- Julie Bowen!

07:31.033 --> 07:33.286
<i>Actually, it was Tony Wonder,</i>

07:33.369 --> 07:36.038
<i>a man Gob had been longing
to hear from ever since</i>

07:36.122 --> 07:39.417
<i>the gay magician poofed
into his life,</i>

07:39.500 --> 07:41.711
<i>- and then, just as quickly...</i>
- Oh,.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.753
<i>...disa-poofed.</i>

07:42.837 --> 07:45.506
The Rebel thing
almost ruined my relationship with my son.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.467
And I think that it's a good thing

07:47.550 --> 07:49.469
she's lost interest in George Michael.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.180
- I have to tell you...
- That never made sense.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.347
It never made sense.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.433
It never made sense,
because, you know,

07:55.516 --> 07:59.312
he doesn't fit in with those people,
and I think that George Michael and I

07:59.395 --> 08:00.688
are gonna be closer than ever.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.899
He's gonna need a father...
still needs a father.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.151
The only mother figure he's ever had

08:05.234 --> 08:07.361
- in his life was...
- Oh, it was Mom.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.948
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.035
Huh, poor kid.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.829
- I can't imagine.
- Nor can I.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.380
- Wait, <i>we </i> had Mom.
- You know, in a way, she was <i>our </i> mom.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.469
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>was seeking motherly advice</i>

08:31.552 --> 08:33.135
<i>from a cousin</i>

08:33.221 --> 08:35.597
<i>- who'd been living as a grandma.</i>
- Aha.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.267
I heard we're getting a visit
from the grandson. Want a lick?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.770
- Oh, my God, no.
- Good, more for me.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.606
- Gonna have more? I can come back.
- No, no. Come on in.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.942
I heard you're having
relationship trouble.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.402
I'll go get your...
What do you call her? Gangie?

08:48.486 --> 08:49.403
Maeby...

08:49.862 --> 08:51.572
I <i>should </i> call her that.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.325
Uh, yeah, relationship problems.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.702
- Gangie gets it.
- Yeah, she sure helped me.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.371
Imagine finding love at my age.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.248
It is hard to imagine, but, uh,

09:00.331 --> 09:02.458
maybe you'll find something else,
like a hobby

09:02.542 --> 09:03.918
- or a napkin.
- Mm.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.046
Annette, your grandson's here.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.673
I have no makeup on,

09:08.756 --> 09:10.800
- I'm a mess. Cover your eyes.
- Too late.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.843
I won't look.
If your grandson wasn't here,

09:12.927 --> 09:14.595
I'd probably take a peeky-weeky.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.182
Well, hey,
what a surprise... honey.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.977
You're living with this guy?

09:21.060 --> 09:24.689
Hey, my fake identity is none of
your fake identity's business, okay?

09:24.772 --> 09:26.607
Speaking of that,
things have gotten worse.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.860
Not only does my dad think Fakeblock
is real, and I've got money

09:29.944 --> 09:32.822
I won't share with him
when he needs to bail out Buster,

09:33.364 --> 09:36.033
but he also thinks I should
take things slower with Rebel.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.868
I don't know,
but here's my idea about her.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.745
What do women really want?

09:39.829 --> 09:41.414
Their fathers' attention.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.749
And Ron Howard is a buttoned-down guy,
right?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.543
What if he doesn't like you?

09:46.085 --> 09:48.129
What if you show up to the barbecue
with pink hair?

09:48.212 --> 09:49.338
- Pink hair?
- Yeah.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.509
I saw it on someone recently,
and it made me want to puke. Trust me.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.803
You are gonna be like, "Burn!"

09:56.804 --> 09:58.097
That's starting to tingle.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.890
Let me know when it starts to burn.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.435
- It's gonna burn?
- Did I not make that clear?

10:02.935 --> 10:05.938
Nobody said getting out of a relationship
would be painless.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.441
You should talk about
getting out of a relationship.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.402
I think your friend Stan
might be interested in you

10:11.485 --> 10:13.779
in a way that you don't want him
to be interested.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.574
That would explain
why he's offering to do my laundry.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.494
Well, whatever gets him to do my laundry,
huh?

10:20.578 --> 10:22.955
Yeah, no, I'll suss it out.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.916
This lie I'm living might be
sending him mixed signals.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.919
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>some mixed signals</i>

10:29.003 --> 10:31.255
<i>were also being sent
on Pacific Coast Highway...</i>

10:31.339 --> 10:34.008
Technically,
they had to call me Rock Monster.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.677
<i>...as Tobias</i>
<i>and his newly found son</i>

10:36.761 --> 10:39.430
<i>were headed to Mexico
to find his newly lost wife.</i>

10:39.513 --> 10:41.098
And John Beard actually said

10:41.182 --> 10:43.559
I was one of the more popular predators,

10:43.643 --> 10:45.978
so whatever gets your name
and weight out there.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.022
But I want to hear about <i>your </i> dreams.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.941
I don't know.
I'm really good at computers.

10:51.025 --> 10:51.859
It's fun, too.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.903
Kind of like the only time I feel alive.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.321
No, no, your dreams,

10:55.404 --> 10:58.407
not what you think will make you rich.
Your passion.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.535
Oh, also maybe being,
like, a doctor for animals,

11:01.619 --> 11:04.288
or their dogs, 'cause sometimes,
if I look at an animal,

11:04.372 --> 11:06.582
there's, like, a special connection.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.334
Dreams! Dreams.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.337
I didn't ask,
"What part of a dog do you want to touch?"

11:11.712 --> 11:15.007
Okay, let's try this in reverse.
Uh, you're famous.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.802
Uh, what is the thing you do
that makes everyone clap?

11:19.261 --> 11:22.181
Ooh! Once I got claps
for doing a juggling ball thing,

11:22.431 --> 11:25.393
'cause I'd unicycle
in Haiti when I was volunteering...

11:25.476 --> 11:28.270
Yes! Clowning, yes!
Now, you're dreaming.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.064
That's your dream.

11:30.147 --> 11:33.401
Well, perhaps we should juggle
your priorities.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.318
Oh.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.072
<i>And Michael</i>
<i>was preparing his brother</i>

11:38.155 --> 11:41.242
<i>to persuade Kitty to give back
their movie rights.</i>

11:41.325 --> 11:43.077
Good. Here comes Kitty.
Here she comes.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.829
- I believe in you. You can do her.
- What?

11:44.912 --> 11:47.915
<i>This. </i> You can do this...
<i>to </i> her.

11:47.998 --> 11:51.502
Michael! Whatever it is, the answer is no,
unless you want the answer to be no,

11:51.585 --> 11:54.964
- and then, it is yes.
- Well, Gob, I want you to,

11:55.047 --> 11:57.508
- uh, to see who's here.
- Gob.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.262
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.681
I was gonna say, they look puffy and red.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.812
- You guys need to get a room, huh?
- Right?

12:09.895 --> 12:11.355
Why don't you guys get a room,

12:11.439 --> 12:13.357
and I can say hi to Ron?
What do you think?

12:13.441 --> 12:17.236
He's not in the office today.
He has some family event.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.905
- Oh, is that today?
- But since he's not here,

12:19.989 --> 12:21.782
how would you like
to get inside of a LEM?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.242
If I could j... Um, Michael.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.869
- I just...
- Yeah?

12:24.952 --> 12:26.746
- I can't do this.
- No. You're gonna be fine.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.039
You're gonna be fine.
You were built for this, okay?

12:29.123 --> 12:30.791
I can see she's got gum
in her mouth.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.544
She can hear you.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.130
You're overthinking it.
Nothing to worry about.

12:36.213 --> 12:39.425
- It was in the past. You've been there.
- Let me get out of your hair.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.093
- And you can get in my hair.
- God, no.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.595
You can't make me touch her hair.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.181
- I'm not gonna touch her hair.
- Come on, Gob.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.477
<i>And nearby,</i>
<i>George Maharis was ready to alienate</i>

12:49.560 --> 12:52.396
<i>his soon to be ex-girlfriend's family</i>

12:53.272 --> 12:56.066
<i>with a head full of Tobias Pink hair.</i>

12:57.568 --> 12:59.487
Hey! There you are.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.364
Dad, this is George Maharis.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.075
- Oh, neat to meet you.
- Neat to meet you.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.786
Rebel says neat things about you.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.580
What's up?

13:09.663 --> 13:12.750
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Maeby left the dye in too long,</i>

13:12.833 --> 13:14.460
<i>- and it turned out to be...</i>
- Look.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.920
Howard Red.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.964
No, it isn't. It... It's...

13:21.884 --> 13:24.220
- Imagine if it was pink, though.
- Yeah, but it's not.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.139
It's Howard Red.
Cheryl, look at what this kid did.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.766
It's like our hair.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.935
Someone's come a-courtin'.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.395
You're fitting in already.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.819
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's just my family.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.279
We Howards don't just laugh
when things are funny.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.531
We laugh when we're happy.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.908
And when things are uncomfortable, too.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.327
You mean, when bad reviews
start rolling in?

13:54.083 --> 13:55.793
So, Rebel tells me

13:55.876 --> 13:59.338
that you're an entrepreneur,
some sort of security software?

13:59.421 --> 14:03.217
Oh, Dad, it's called Fakeblock,
and it's amazing.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.719
The company's gonna go under
by next week. We're broke.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.223
Guess I'm not exactly
daddy's dream boyfriend, am I?

14:09.932 --> 14:12.226
Listen, don't worry
about that company stuff.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.271
- When I started Imagine...
<i>- With Brian Grazer.</i>

14:15.354 --> 14:17.982
...the company was up to its neck in debt,
but look at me...

14:18.065 --> 14:19.692
- <i>And Brian.</i>
- ...now.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.611
And in those early days, I can't tell you

14:22.695 --> 14:25.614
how many times I felt like a fraud.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.952
But I'll tell you a secret,
everyone feels that way.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.997
<i>George Michael was touched</i>
<i>by the advice...</i>

14:33.080 --> 14:35.791
But enough business talk.
Tell me, do you like hot dogs?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.043
<i>...but he made one last attempt</i>

14:38.127 --> 14:39.879
<i>to offend his host...</i>

14:39.962 --> 14:42.298
No, I don't like hot dogs.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.012
- <i>...but couldn't.</i>
- I love them.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.977
- No.
- Oh, my God.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.187
You're good. You're good.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.945
<i>What a neat group.</i>

15:05.613 --> 15:08.908
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was trying
to get in the mood with Kitty.</i>

15:09.658 --> 15:11.911
Hard to believe
they used to put monkeys in these.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.747
My guess?

15:14.830 --> 15:17.249
They wouldn't be able
to figure out a lot of this stuff.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.376
Yeah. Monkeys are kind of dumb.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.046
I'd like to see one get out of here
quickly in an emergency.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.423
They'd be all...

15:24.506 --> 15:26.508
I have to get out of here.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.761
Get me out of here.

15:28.844 --> 15:32.431
Ah, too good,
too good, too good.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.434
So...

15:35.517 --> 15:37.394
surely you didn't want
to be alone with me

15:37.478 --> 15:39.605
to talk about monkeys in space.

15:39.688 --> 15:43.734
No. I did not want to be alone
with you at all.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.532
Remind me not to forget my gum.

15:50.616 --> 15:54.036
One sec. Probably my brother.

15:54.119 --> 15:57.706
- "Did you trick her into it yet?"
- "Trick her into what?"

15:57.790 --> 15:59.541
"Giving us our rights back, you geo..."

15:59.625 --> 16:02.836
It's Tony. I gotta take this.
Can I get some privacy?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.588
- We're sealed in here.
- I gotta get out.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.382
- You can't turn that...
- Get me out of here.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.967
- No, no!
- It'll go to voicemail!

16:08.050 --> 16:09.218
I gotta blow the hatch!

16:09.301 --> 16:11.845
- That's the chute!
- God, I just...

16:13.722 --> 16:15.182
'mazing Jesus.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.393
<i>Hey, it's Tony.</i>

16:17.851 --> 16:19.061
Oh.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.606
If I'd known, I wouldn't have picked up.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.651
I think that we're stuck in here.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.112
- Where are you?
<i>- Oh, um...</i>

16:28.195 --> 16:30.406
I'm in a LEM. Where are you?

16:30.489 --> 16:33.283
I'm in a Tumi... suitcase.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.703
I think I'm in baggage claim
at Long Beach Airport.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.079
My assistant's picking me up,

16:37.162 --> 16:39.248
unless she takes
another gray Tumi by mistake,

16:39.331 --> 16:40.791
then I go to unclaimed.

16:40.916 --> 16:45.295
<i>- That's how we lost the Amazing Frederick.</i>
- I would've claimed you.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.423
I'll bet.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.057
Since I'm getting back in town,
I thought I owed you a call.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.475
<i>So, let's get together.</i>

16:58.559 --> 17:01.395
I can't right now. I've got this thing...

17:01.687 --> 17:03.480
...I'm stuck in the LEM with.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.940
<i>That's the other thing.</i>

17:05.022 --> 17:07.943
I don't think we can actually hang out,
anyway.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.819
I mean,
I'm the flamboyant gay magician.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.073
<i>You're the super straight
Christian magician.</i>

17:13.156 --> 17:14.867
<i>We'll taint each other's brand.</i>

17:15.367 --> 17:17.036
Yeah.

17:17.743 --> 17:21.999
I guess we're...
different in the same way.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.626
Same, in a different way.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.919
- Different...
- Same...

17:26.002 --> 17:28.630
- ...in a same, different way.
- ...in a different way, same.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.008
- Different, wifferent...
- Same way.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.010
- ...in a same gay way?
- Different same.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.470
- It...
- Wame.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.472
Wow. Guess that's over.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.640
Yup. Talk about a sign.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.559
<i>And that's when they realized</i>

17:40.642 --> 17:42.728
<i>there was a time
when they could speak in unison,</i>

17:42.811 --> 17:44.438
<i>but I guess it was over now.</i>

17:44.897 --> 17:47.524
I gotta run.
I better shut up and listen for "wonder."

17:47.608 --> 17:49.276
<i>Wait, so is this goodbye...</i>

17:56.575 --> 17:58.035
How much did you hear?

17:59.286 --> 18:01.914
<i>And George Sr.</i>
<i>visited his prison alma mater</i>

18:01.997 --> 18:04.208
<i>for the first time
since his son had been incarcerated.</i>

18:04.291 --> 18:06.919
This is where I ate a battery
during my first week at recess.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.630
No, no, "yard." Don't call it recess.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.840
Well, it's a little too late for that,
Dad.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.218
I've been trying to figure out prison
on my own.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.678
- I know. Sorry...
- George Bluth! Oh, my God.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.640
- I've never seen you in street clothes.
- Duck?

18:19.723 --> 18:23.018
I almost didn't recognize you
without the flashlight in your mouth.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.108
Sorry to be rude.
This is my son, Buster.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.734
Charmed, I'm...

18:30.818 --> 18:32.569
No touching.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.989
<i>And perhaps</i>
<i>that was why George Sr.</i>

18:36.073 --> 18:38.158
<i>decided he owed it to his son</i>

18:38.242 --> 18:40.369
<i>to share some
of his own caged wisdom.</i>

18:40.452 --> 18:42.955
Buster,
you have to toughen up now.

18:43.038 --> 18:45.290
You're in lock-up, all right?
They'll circle like jackals.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.001
You gotta be strong,
especially with the skinheads.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.337
Skinhead gets in your face,
you charge back at him.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.338
You pop him fast.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.674
That's the only way you can get respect.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.218
That one there's
been giving me looks.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.886
No. That's not a skinhead.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.430
That's a guard.
You charge at a guard, they'll kill you.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.641
Oh, yeah. That I should know.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.269
But with a skinhead,
that's how you get respect.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.230
I got more respect then,
with these animals,

19:08.313 --> 19:11.150
than I get with your...
with your mother now.

19:11.608 --> 19:15.154
I can't...

19:15.237 --> 19:17.239
I can't satisfy her.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.491
- Really? It's so easy.
- No, I mean,

19:19.575 --> 19:21.660
we are no longer together.
Your mother kicked me out.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.204
- Oh, there's an opening.
- No, no, no.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.748
No, she doesn't want anything
to do with either of us.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.459
She has found someone new.
She's found a younger man.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.878
- Yeah.
- Oh.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.421
Sort of a son with benefits.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.174
They said that I'd lose my old lady,

19:35.883 --> 19:37.217
and I said, "Not mother!"

19:37.301 --> 19:38.552
- Okay.
- "She'll wait for me!"

19:38.635 --> 19:40.012
Shh.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.306
The thought of her
singing to him goodnight.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.314
I can't take it. I can't take it.

19:50.397 --> 19:53.192
I know. I know.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.776
No touching.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.320
<i>And that's when George Sr.</i>

19:56.403 --> 19:58.614
<i>decided to have someone else
put him out of his misery.</i>

19:58.697 --> 19:59.823
I know what I have to do.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.575
- What are you gonna do?
- I know.

20:01.658 --> 20:02.784
What are you gonna do?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.453
I know what I have to do.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.747
- Oh... are you...
- I'm sorry.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.378
Jesus Christ, George.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.715
I was so mad when I thought
you didn't recognize me.

20:18.634 --> 20:19.968
<i>♪ What could be better? ♪</i>

20:20.052 --> 20:21.887
God, this place has changed.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.680
<i>George Michael was also</i>

20:23.764 --> 20:26.016
<i>finding a reunion more pleasant
than he expected.</i>

20:26.099 --> 20:27.559
Your dad is so nice.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.562
- It's been his job since he was two.
- Huh.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.482
Sometimes, you want to look
in your parents' perfect,

20:33.565 --> 20:36.151
- sweet, kind faces, and tell them off.
- Punch them.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.569
Why would you say that?

20:37.653 --> 20:38.779
No, no, I... That...

20:38.862 --> 20:41.073
I don't feel that way,
but certain kids do.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.282
There's a website about it.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.494
Although, everyone knows
it's biased in favor of the dads.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.080
- Your company should shut that site down.
- Well...

20:48.163 --> 20:51.083
<i>And George Michael,</i>
<i>finding himself smitten</i>

20:51.166 --> 20:54.670
<i>with Rebel and her family,
decided to come clean...</i>

20:54.920 --> 20:57.839
To be honest, I don't know
if there's gonna be a company.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.468
<i>...until she said this.</i>

21:01.551 --> 21:03.053
Is it a money thing?

21:03.136 --> 21:05.097
If you need money,
I can loan it to you.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.391
Everybody needs a bailout now and then.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.434
It'll give me a stake in the company.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.188
<i>And the prospect of</i>
<i>helping his family...</i>

21:13.272 --> 21:16.441
Well, speaking of family,
I actually could use a little...

21:16.525 --> 21:18.110
<i>...proved too great</i>
<i>a temptation.</i>

21:18.193 --> 21:19.861
...bailout money, as you put it.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.947
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

21:22.030 --> 21:24.616
Oh, my God, You are great.
Why don't we talk about it tomorrow?

21:24.700 --> 21:27.119
Ah, I can't do it tomorrow.
I've got reshoots.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.370
All the Mexico stuff.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.789
And so you know,
my ex-boyfriend will be there.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.417
But if I know you're gonna be here
when I get back...

21:33.500 --> 21:34.376
Then when you're back.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.169
Yes!

21:36.253 --> 21:37.963
Wait. What color's your hair gonna be?

21:38.046 --> 21:40.465
It's like kissing your cousin. Ugh.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.426
Ew. Okay. Gross, okay. Got it.

21:44.553 --> 21:48.640
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby was concerned</i>
<i>that Stan's strange behavior was romantic,</i>

21:48.807 --> 21:50.225
<i>so she tried to discourage it.</i>

21:50.309 --> 21:53.729
Maybe I'm trying to prove
something to my clueless dad.

21:54.354 --> 21:58.567
Anyway, I guess that's why
I can't make a relationship work.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.402
Does that upset you?

22:00.485 --> 22:02.863
Annette, it does,
if you must know the truth,

22:03.071 --> 22:04.448
'cause your dad was a fool.

22:04.531 --> 22:07.743
I see the real you: a special,
wonderful, unique,

22:07.826 --> 22:10.412
67-year-old woman
who amazes me every day.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.206
<i>And that's when Maeby realized</i>
<i>what it was about</i>

22:13.290 --> 22:15.459
<i>Stan's behavior that was so confusing.</i>

22:16.043 --> 22:17.836
It would be my pleasure
to be the man in your life

22:17.919 --> 22:19.755
that your father never was.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.591
<i>It was paternal, and, touched,</i>

22:22.674 --> 22:24.801
<i>all she could think of to say was...</i>

22:24.885 --> 22:26.762
Bury me.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.306
<i>And Maeby's actual father,</i>

22:29.389 --> 22:31.683
<i>and his newfound son, Murphybrown,</i>

22:31.767 --> 22:34.686
<i>arrived at the last place
he'd seen Lindsay:</i>

22:34.770 --> 22:36.772
<i>Father B's now-abandoned property.</i>

22:36.855 --> 22:38.982
Keep an eye out for Lindsay.
That is why we're here.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.277
Wait, is that her? Is that Lindsay?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.488
Oh, yes. Lindsay!

22:44.571 --> 22:46.698
It's us! It's us! Hi!

22:47.366 --> 22:50.535
Oh, no. That's a sickly cactus
with a plastic bag on it.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.871
Right. For a second,
I was like, "Is that Lindsay?"

22:52.954 --> 22:54.373
I suppose it's true.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.916
The desert makes one see

22:55.999 --> 22:59.503
- what one wants to see.
- Hmm. Yeah.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.088
Is that two barrel-chested,

23:01.171 --> 23:03.507
strapping men
on horseback approaching us?

23:06.259 --> 23:08.553
You are not welcome
on this land.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.013
There must be some mistake.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.057
No, there is no mistake.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.685
I regret to inform you
that you are trespassing.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.605
Mm... no, this land belongs
to George Bluth.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.649
Oh. I see.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.402
- And are you George Bluth?
- N...

23:23.485 --> 23:26.571
<i>It was a part</i>
<i>that Tobias had played before.</i>

23:26.655 --> 23:29.908
You are about to witness why
a career in entertainment

23:29.991 --> 23:30.992
can come in handy.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.996
Yeah, that's right.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.668
I'm the last guy you want to kick off
of your la... his land... my land.

23:39.751 --> 23:40.710
- Our land.
- No.

23:40.794 --> 23:44.423
Oh, I did not realize
you were Mr. George Bluth himself.

23:44.881 --> 23:48.260
Well, Mr. George Bluth,
we have some papers for you to sign.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.011
Oh, is that right?

23:50.095 --> 23:51.638
Well, how about I just...

23:51.721 --> 23:54.349
use my son Michael
as a signing surface?

23:54.474 --> 23:55.600
- Get up.
- Okay.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.353
<i>Tobias wasn't the only</i>
<i>one trespassing</i>

23:58.437 --> 24:00.522
<i>on someone else's property,
as Michael had decided</i>

24:00.605 --> 24:03.358
<i>to do what he was certain
Gob couldn't:</i>

24:03.442 --> 24:05.402
<i>take matters into his own hands.</i>

24:05.485 --> 24:09.614
I can't tell you how many times
I've felt like a fraud.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.284
But I'll tell you a secret, everyone...

24:12.367 --> 24:14.286
Hey, Ron. Michael.

24:14.369 --> 24:16.872
From that untitled Bluth project.

24:16.955 --> 24:19.166
- Then I dated Rebel.
- Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.083
Prayer hands.

24:20.667 --> 24:24.087
Yeah. Listen, a lot of stuff has changed
with the family.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.006
Yeah. I heard about that.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.549
Oh, has it gotten out?

24:27.966 --> 24:29.509
Not to the general public,

24:29.593 --> 24:31.428
but at Imagine, we hear everything.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.138
<i>You know I'm as straight</i>

24:33.221 --> 24:35.891
as they come, I just got a lot
on my mind right now

24:35.974 --> 24:38.935
with work, slash, am I gay,
slash, Buster's in jail.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.229
- He is? What for?
- Well, just for...

24:41.313 --> 24:44.649
for maybe killing this woman
my family owes money to.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.067
I think it was his robot hand.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.861
- Get me Ron.
- It's hush-hush.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.447
Okay, so then you might understand why

24:50.530 --> 24:52.115
we don't want a movie about it.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.409
Absolutely.
You'd have to cut too much.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.371
This has true crime limited series
written all over it.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.540
That way, my Rebel could be in it, too.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.792
She's no Bryce, but she's like a robot.

25:03.126 --> 25:06.796
Gives the exact same performance
every take. Real time-saver.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.798
So, yes, let's do this.

25:08.882 --> 25:12.344
Here's the thing. Right now,
my family is not looking for publicity.

25:12.427 --> 25:15.180
The other way to look at it is
if I heard about it,

25:15.263 --> 25:16.431
it's out there.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.642
Best way to manage press
is to get in front of it.

25:18.725 --> 25:21.895
Hey, Dad. We need you
for the three-legged race.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.981
- Also, can you start the music?
- I don't know how to, Reed.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.401
Oh. I must've heard that.
I must've heard that.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.570
Right? Sure. That, uh... so you get...

25:30.654 --> 25:33.823
- Do you get the scripts read to you?
- Uh...

25:34.491 --> 25:36.576
This is my son, Reed.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.869
My dad knows how to read.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.330
Yes.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.375
Nice to meet you.
Uh, yeah. Whenever.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.169
I see why
you named him Reed.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.254
He seems smart.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.465
Hey, thanks for sneaking in.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.093
Yep.

25:53.176 --> 25:56.763
<i>As he rushed to get out</i>
<i>before running into Rebel,</i>

25:56.846 --> 25:59.808
<i>Michael ran into yet another
famous Howard.</i>

25:59.891 --> 26:01.101
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.061
Avoiding the three-legged race,
I see.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.229
Bryce!

26:04.312 --> 26:06.481
I'm sorry, but I just can't, Reed.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.985
Oh,
talking to your brother Reed. I get it.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.278
Michael Bluth. Pleasure.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.904
- Hi. Bryce.
- Yeah, no. I know.

26:12.988 --> 26:16.366
Oh, yes. Yes, you dated my sister,
didn't you?

26:16.449 --> 26:18.034
Well, even that overstates it.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.829
We weren't together long
before we broke up.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.081
- You know, very clean break.
- Oh.

26:23.164 --> 26:26.001
I was gonna say hi,
but I ain't not going somewhere.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.003
But I-I'm going somewhere.
Never mind.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.006
Listen, you dodged a bullet.
She's a user.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.425
She's got a new guy.
And she's using him.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.802
Yeah?
But I heard that's ending.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.887
No, are you kidding? He's trapped.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.472
- Hmm.
- In her web.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.975
She's with him
because of his Internet company.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.018
You know that, right?

26:44.311 --> 26:47.147
You think so?
Do you think that she's just using him?

26:47.230 --> 26:50.483
Yeah. And I'm pretty sure
it's not for his body.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.653
Oh, well... I mean, I don't know the guy,

26:53.737 --> 26:54.738
but I saw a picture.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.949
I think he's got a great build.
You know? Um, he's wiry.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.576
You wouldn't want him to be taller.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.662
I like the young man's body.
Okay? I do.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.957
Yeah, well,
that's very weird of you.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.792
Still, such a kiss-up.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.919
He's even dyed his hair
Dallas Howard Red.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.546
- I get it. It's a hot new dye,
- New dye?

27:11.630 --> 27:13.757
But you're not supposed
to leave it in that long.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.885
Look at him. Ugh.
He looks like a jack-o'-lantern.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.971
- Put your head down.
- What...

27:21.765 --> 27:23.600
- Dork.
- Can I exit through the house?

27:23.683 --> 27:25.935
I don't want the user
to create a dramatic scene.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.687
No. Don't worry about that.

27:27.771 --> 27:31.358
I have seen her get laughs
doing <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

27:33.151 --> 27:34.819
Oh. I don't get it.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.489
<i>Michael was hoping</i>
<i>to avoid an awkward run-in</i>

27:37.572 --> 27:39.324
<i>with his son at the valet,</i>

27:39.407 --> 27:42.661
<i>when he came across a way
to find out when the coast was clear.</i>

27:42.744 --> 27:44.454
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

27:44.537 --> 27:46.289
Yeah, that's a sweet setup there.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.124
I wanted to take a peek.
Do you mind?

27:48.208 --> 27:49.751
I want to check out my son.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.378
Uh, that I understand.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.089
My name is Rance Howard,
Ron's dad.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.258
I thought you worked here. Hi.

27:57.342 --> 28:00.553
Well, I like to stay busy,
keep an eye on my son, too.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.847
Oh, yeah? You still have to do that?

28:02.931 --> 28:05.684
That's a father's job.
Doesn't start at 9:00 and end at 5:00.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.561
It's 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

28:08.645 --> 28:09.771
Even as they get older, huh?

28:09.854 --> 28:12.482
It gets even harder,
'cause they think they know it all.

28:12.565 --> 28:15.735
You still have to be there for them
when they make mistakes.

28:15.819 --> 28:18.571
Or sometimes they need
to cry a little bit

28:18.655 --> 28:21.825
because sometimes a person needs
to cry a little bit.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.828
Unless that person is a dad.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.872
For a father must
bear his load lightly,

28:27.956 --> 28:32.836
and yet, beneath the mask,
a watchful eye never wanders.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.588
For it is through this glance

28:36.047 --> 28:39.843
that a wisdom beyond words
must be passed.

28:40.343 --> 28:41.469
That's an interesting take.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.097
Because I think a girl
might be using my son,

28:44.222 --> 28:47.350
but I don't exactly have a way
to keep an eye on her...

28:48.977 --> 28:50.603
Oh, I see you met my dad.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.189
He doesn't say much,
but we're sure glad he's around.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.400
Although,
hopefully he didn't share his thoughts

28:55.483 --> 28:56.943
about climate change, did he?

28:57.026 --> 28:59.571
- Hoax!
- He was great company.

28:59.654 --> 29:03.074
<i>That's when Michael found a way</i>
<i>to keep an eye on the woman</i>

29:03.158 --> 29:04.659
<i>who might be using his son.</i>

29:04.743 --> 29:06.494
Know what else is a good company?

29:06.578 --> 29:07.912
Imagine Entertainment.

29:08.580 --> 29:12.000
And I think that I want to go forward
with that docuseries after all.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.878
That's great news. Hey, Jocelyn!

29:14.961 --> 29:18.006
Would you mind bringing down
the standard TV contracts, please?

29:18.089 --> 29:20.216
Streaming contracts,
cable or broadcast?

29:20.300 --> 29:21.801
- A streamer!
- No residuals.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.220
Jocey will have those down
in just a minute,

29:24.304 --> 29:26.848
and if we're quick, we can get
an interview with your brother

29:26.931 --> 29:28.349
while he's still in jail.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.143
You know, you can't beat
those visuals.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.312
Put a little atmosphere
in there, you filter it...

29:32.395 --> 29:35.690
Nice low-angle shot for the close-up...

29:38.401 --> 29:41.780
Oh, a wide shot.
Tell it in one image.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.365
<i>Yes, a wide shot.</i>

29:45.325 --> 29:46.409
Wide shot.

29:47.368 --> 29:48.953
<i>Michael returned home...</i>

29:49.871 --> 29:51.498
How did it go with Gob and Kitty?

29:51.581 --> 29:53.750
<i>...where his mother</i>
<i>had been lying in wait.</i>

29:53.833 --> 29:55.835
Tell me he got her to kill the movie.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.880
Well,
I think he probably forgot to ask.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.715
That's okay 'cause I spoke to Ron.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.551
He was very happy to see me.
It felt good.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.012
That's just Hollywood BS.

30:06.095 --> 30:07.764
Well, I think it's gonna help us.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.808
You think what is going to help us?

30:09.891 --> 30:11.142
Oh, God. I'm burying the lead.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.978
The Bluth project is dead because...

30:14.687 --> 30:16.606
it's gonna be a streaming series.

30:16.689 --> 30:20.109
We said no leaks,
and now we're streaming over everyone?

30:20.193 --> 30:22.153
I'm not telling it well. The point is,

30:22.237 --> 30:23.905
Ron's gonna do
an introductory interview,

30:23.988 --> 30:26.574
okay, with Buster, as research

30:26.658 --> 30:28.618
about the family's history,
and what...

30:28.701 --> 30:31.204
Michael, they cannot go
into our family's past.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.581
They certainly can't do
a TV show about it.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.208
It's never gonna get that far.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.377
It's gonna send a signal to the DA

30:37.460 --> 30:39.838
that if they hold Buster,
they're looking for trouble.

30:39.921 --> 30:40.755
Think about it.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.048
If the nicest man in the world

30:42.131 --> 30:43.758
goes in there with his camera
and crew,

30:43.842 --> 30:45.802
and he tells Buster
he believes in his innocence...

30:45.885 --> 30:48.346
They'll drop the charges
quicker than you can blink your...

30:49.639 --> 30:52.058
Initiate, at least,
the blinking of the eyes.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.476
The opening of the eyes is, uh,

30:53.560 --> 30:55.603
a bit of a guestimate lately.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.438
And what if Buster chokes?

30:58.147 --> 30:59.899
I guess that's what Ron's for.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.402
<i>That would prove</i>
<i>to be a very...</i>

31:02.485 --> 31:05.113
<i>No, you'll see on the next
"On the Next."</i>

31:05.196 --> 31:07.574
<i>On the next </i> Arrested Development...

31:07.657 --> 31:11.995
On the next shot,
I know we said close-ups. No, wide.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.580
<i>...Ron Howard arranges</i>

31:13.663 --> 31:16.207
<i>a jailhouse interview with Buster...</i>

31:17.083 --> 31:18.543
Here we go.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.086
Showtime.

31:20.169 --> 31:23.006
<i>...and Buster remembers
George Sr.'s advice.</i>

31:23.089 --> 31:23.923
A skinhead.

31:25.174 --> 31:27.677
I'm gonna kill you,
you bleeping skinhead!

31:27.760 --> 31:29.512
Oh, hey!

31:29.596 --> 31:31.347
Skinhead!

31:31.764 --> 31:33.474
See what I did to skinhead?

31:33.558 --> 31:35.560
Mm. Make a note.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.645
Forget the wide shots.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.023
50/50 and matching overs.

31:40.356 --> 31:43.526
<i>And Maeby enjoys her</i>
<i>new paternal relationship.</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:46.029
Look how happy they look together.

31:46.821 --> 31:47.780
Just like us.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.035
<i>Until this happens.</i>

31:56.372 --> 31:59.292
Okay, so I did have it
right the first time.
