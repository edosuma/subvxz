00:01.201 --> 00:02.734
Didn't you just cut his hair?

00:02.803 --> 00:06.337
Yes, but it's his kindergarten
graduation party today.

00:06.405 --> 00:08.806
Okay, no messy goodbyes,
I'm out of here.

00:08.874 --> 00:11.041
Ay, papi, I'm going to miss you.

00:11.110 --> 00:14.311
Can you at least stay for the
party that I'm making for Joe?

00:14.359 --> 00:15.758
Mom, Mrs. Nussbaum is paying me

00:15.827 --> 00:17.827
to get her car to Delaware
by Friday at noon.

00:17.896 --> 00:19.696
I already lost an hour
looking for my driving gloves.

00:19.764 --> 00:22.865
You're plowing through the heartlands
in an inchworm-green Camry

00:22.904 --> 00:24.837
with a bumper sticker that says
"Meat is Murder."

00:24.906 --> 00:27.106
I hid these gloves for a reason.

00:27.594 --> 00:31.630
Listen, uh, we weren't kidding
about you being careful.

00:31.698 --> 00:35.300
And, uh, not to get dramatic,
just keep your wits about you.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.735
Here.

00:36.804 --> 00:37.936
What the hell is that?

00:38.005 --> 00:39.538
It's an air freshener.
What does it look like?

00:39.606 --> 00:41.106
I'm going on the Martha Stewart

00:41.175 --> 00:42.474
bed-and-breakfast tour of America,

00:42.543 --> 00:44.075
not an Aboriginal manhood quest.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.310
I'm not saying you're gonna need it,

00:45.379 --> 00:46.711
just better safe than sorry.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.146
Slash, don't stab.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.448
Uh...

00:49.516 --> 00:52.484
Stop wiggling. I'm almost done.

Uh, Cam? Uh, turns out I have to
do that work thing after all.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.944
I'll meet you at Joe's party?

01:19.012 --> 01:21.246
Oh, okay. Cal, come give your
Uncle Mitchell a hug.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.414
CAL: Hug!

01:22.483 --> 01:23.648
No. No, no hug. No... where is he?

01:23.717 --> 01:25.617
Which way is he coming from?
Coming from?

01:25.686 --> 01:27.619
Ahhh!

01:28.413 --> 01:30.613
Cam's sister's son is staying with us

01:30.682 --> 01:32.115
because, well, you know,
she's back in jail.

01:32.176 --> 01:35.277
But she didn't do anything terrible.
She just didn't understand

01:35.345 --> 01:37.078
the rules of her probation
from last time, when...

01:37.147 --> 01:38.747
When she did something
a little terrible.

01:38.816 --> 01:40.749
But we're taking baby Cal back to

01:40.818 --> 01:42.117
live with my parents on the farm.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.019
Which is a good thing
because he's not really a...

01:44.087 --> 01:45.487
a house baby.

01:45.556 --> 01:48.824
No, no, he's freakishly strong
and off the charts size-wise.

01:48.892 --> 01:50.659
On the charts. 99th percentile.

01:50.727 --> 01:53.562
He has two teeth and I've seen
him eat a whole chicken.

01:54.598 --> 01:55.997
All right, I got to go.

01:56.066 --> 01:57.399
- Wait, where's my hug?
- Aww.

01:57.467 --> 02:00.402
- Hug!
- Go! Go! Save yourself!

02:00.470 --> 02:01.903
Ohh. Yep.

02:01.972 --> 02:03.705
- Hey.
- Hey!

02:03.774 --> 02:06.007
[CHUCKLES] Our costumes are in the back.

02:06.076 --> 02:07.509
Phil and I are going to Hero-Con

02:07.578 --> 02:10.078
to indulge in our love
of fantasy fiction.

02:10.146 --> 02:11.546
Um, I-I've always wanted to go,

02:11.615 --> 02:13.081
but i-it's a little nerd-forward,

02:13.150 --> 02:15.383
and I was always afraid
my family would make fun of me.

02:15.452 --> 02:17.018
So I've asked Phil
to keep it between us.

02:17.087 --> 02:19.254
That's why we chose
our secret warrior signal.

02:19.323 --> 02:21.256
My first suggestion
was to blow a Viking horn.

02:21.325 --> 02:22.724
- Don't ever Google that, by the way.
- I already did.

02:22.793 --> 02:25.460
This year, there's a panel,
um, on our favorite show,

02:25.529 --> 02:26.828
"Clash of Swords."

02:26.897 --> 02:29.931
It's got a lot of graphic
violence and female nudity,

02:30.000 --> 02:31.199
but that's part of its appeal

02:31.268 --> 02:34.769
to the fierce warrior inside every man.

02:34.838 --> 02:36.338
My eyeliner keeps smudging.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.106
Thanks a lot, gal at the MAC counter.

02:38.175 --> 02:39.407
Who cares? We look great.

02:39.476 --> 02:40.775
Let's do this!

02:40.844 --> 02:44.279
Just remember we left our trusty
steed in section 22B.

02:44.348 --> 02:45.413
I can't do it, Phil.

02:45.482 --> 02:46.648
Oh, okay. I can write it down.

02:46.717 --> 02:49.618
No, no. I-I-I thought
I was ready, but I'm not.

02:49.686 --> 02:52.153
I'm not. I-I've fantasized
so long about coming,

02:52.222 --> 02:54.356
and now that... that we're here, I am...

02:54.424 --> 02:57.359
I'm mortified, okay?
I'm a 40-year-old man.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.894
No, you're not.

Nope, she's out sick again.

"I didn't choose closets..."

- Hey...
- Oh.

to hang up our puffer vests,

on some rando's desk.

to stare at their shoes!

some pretty great clients.

Wait a second, is that Margaret?

05:00.001 --> 05:02.368
She's working there.
They must have poached her.

05:02.437 --> 05:04.737
Brainwashed her, is what they did.
Margaret is very vulnerable.

05:40.393 --> 05:41.859
to throw a party
for Miss Jessica's class,

05:41.928 --> 05:44.862

a little party for Miss Elaine.

candy all over the room.

- Luke told me that you've been hounding

drive cross-country alone.

the display of fondue pots

Barbara Walters anchor the news.

of person these cults target!

don't I show you the new model?

- Yes, it is.

automated, intelligent...

07:48.261 --> 07:50.061
That's what they said about
the "mood closet" in the '70s,

07:50.130 --> 07:52.363
- and I buried them.
-Very cranky.

07:52.423 --> 07:54.656
Yes, but he has earned
the right to be cranky,

07:54.725 --> 07:57.359
because my father is a giant
in this industry,

07:57.428 --> 08:00.028
and he had to skip his ice-cream
sandwich today to come here.

08:00.097 --> 08:02.798
Nick, it's time for laser tag.

Yes! You know what?

No matter how it shakes out,
you can keep the pants.

- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Hang on, Dad. I...

08:11.542 --> 08:13.241
I don't like these dorks
any more than you do,

08:13.310 --> 08:15.310
but they might be onto something.

08:15.378 --> 08:16.744
What are you saying? You want to sell?

08:16.813 --> 08:19.347
No, I was thinking more of a merger.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.615
I did some digging,

08:20.684 --> 08:22.684

16:29.641 --> 16:31.841
but if we banish him,

16:31.910 --> 16:34.878
we're no better than the people
who shamed us all these years,

16:34.946 --> 16:37.547
who... who picked us last
for team sports,

16:37.616 --> 16:41.518
who left us off of group e-mails
about bar association dances.

16:41.586 --> 16:44.821
We're all oddballs and misfits
and weirdos,

16:44.890 --> 16:48.758
but the great thing about
this place is we all belong,

16:48.827 --> 16:50.660
especially this good man,

16:50.729 --> 16:53.730
who gave me the courage
to conquer my fear

16:53.799 --> 16:56.132
and become part of this community.

16:56.201 --> 16:57.867
Let's welcome him back.

16:57.936 --> 16:59.569

As a gay man, I know
every party planner in town.

17:10.214 --> 17:12.515

and as luck would have it,

17:12.584 --> 17:14.916
my friend Ronaldo was wrapping
up a kid's Peter Pan party.

You said you were at
a kid's Peter Pan party?

17:27.732 --> 17:30.566
No, no, no.
I said, "Kit's Peter Pan party."

17:32.637 --> 17:34.803

17:38.876 --> 17:41.009
Everybody out! Even the kids!

17:41.078 --> 17:43.879

Go to the nice party!

17:50.554 --> 17:51.820
Thank you so much for today.

17:51.888 --> 17:53.054
I-I never would've gone through with it

17:53.123 --> 17:54.656
if you hadn't inspired me.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.458
- I inspired you?
- Mm.

17:56.526 --> 17:57.992
Wait.

Do you think...

18:10.574 --> 18:12.474
You seem glum.

18:12.542 --> 18:16.911
Perhaps you should be
turning your passions elsewhere.

18:16.980 --> 18:19.247
You're right.
I'm going back to vet school.

It's okay. I'm not mad.

What happened to the party?

18:28.024 --> 18:29.990
Cam ruined it two ways.

18:30.059 --> 18:32.993
I just wanted a nice party for Joe.

18:33.462 --> 18:34.728
There's only so long

18:34.797 --> 18:37.097
that you can make things
perfect for them.

18:37.166 --> 18:38.765
Suddenly, they move on.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.000
They wake up one morning

18:40.069 --> 18:43.470
and they want to drive
a cross-country all alone.

18:43.538 --> 18:44.771
Oh, right, Manny.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.741
I know you're scared,
but your should feel proud.

18:47.809 --> 18:49.509
You took kind of a...

18:49.578 --> 18:51.077
You can say it... a weird kid.

18:51.146 --> 18:53.113
A weird kid,
and turned him into somebody

18:53.181 --> 18:54.614
so comfortable with himself

18:54.683 --> 18:58.418
that he's willing to take on
a pretty big adventure.

18:58.687 --> 18:59.886
Thank you, Cam.

18:59.954 --> 19:01.054
I wish I had that.

19:01.122 --> 19:02.255
I mean, I was a weird kid

19:02.324 --> 19:04.190
whose family only made him feel weirder.

19:04.259 --> 19:06.225
I mean, it took until today
to do an adventure

19:06.294 --> 19:08.628
that I have wanted to do
since I was Manny's age.

19:08.697 --> 19:10.630
I-I went to Hero-Con.

19:10.699 --> 19:11.798
Not in costume?

19:11.866 --> 19:12.965
Affirmative, Fizbo.

19:13.034 --> 19:15.301
Okay, if this is something you're into,
why haven't you ever told me?

19:15.370 --> 19:18.904
I haven't told anyone.
I mean, I tried with my mom once,

19:18.973 --> 19:21.507
but I chickened out
and told her I was gay instead.

19:21.576 --> 19:23.275
And I-I wasn't even sure at that point.

19:23.344 --> 19:26.645
Why are there so many ways
for a parent to break a kid?

19:26.914 --> 19:27.980
Ugh.

CAL: Hug!

19:29.083 --> 19:31.750
No, no, no!

19:31.819 --> 19:34.586
- Oh.
- Oh.

19:34.655 --> 19:37.623
Aw, you know, it makes me
worried for this little guy.

19:37.692 --> 19:39.525
I love my parents,

19:39.593 --> 19:43.162

the best when I was...

Cam, should Cal live with us?

20:00.113 --> 20:02.247
He should.

- Yeah.
- Very well.

Sorry we're late. Traffic, you know.

20:06.153 --> 20:07.752
I keep telling you to try Waze,

and you shouldn't be.
