WEBVTT

00:52.094 --> 00:53.095
Shh!

01:26.295 --> 01:27.964
This is the Mummy of Anka.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.841
Once the most feared ruler
of ancient Egypt.

01:31.217 --> 01:34.095
Wow! He could still scare me, professor.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.222
Don't worry about him, Daphne.

01:36.389 --> 01:39.642
Anka is over 3000 years old.

01:39.809 --> 01:43.312
That's funny. He doesn't look
a day over 2000 to me.

01:43.646 --> 01:44.897
Two thousand!

01:46.732 --> 01:48.317
Thanks to Dr. Najib...

01:48.484 --> 01:52.280
the Mummy of Anka completes
the university's replica of his tomb.

01:52.446 --> 01:57.493
I only hope that the curse of Anka
did not follow, professor.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.453
Curse? What curse?

01:59.620 --> 02:03.291
Anka vowed that if he were ever
removed from his tomb...

02:03.457 --> 02:08.796
he would come back to life
and turn those responsible to stone.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.799
A most ominous curse, I must say.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.010
As all ancient ones are.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.512
Now, if you'll excuse me, professor...

02:16.679 --> 02:19.181
it's time for me to take my leave.

02:19.390 --> 02:22.143
Well, thank you again, Dr. Najib.

02:26.188 --> 02:29.025
I bid you all good night.

02:30.401 --> 02:33.487
Well, do you kids still want to stay
and help me tonight?

02:33.654 --> 02:37.533
It'll take more than a silly,
superstitious curse to scare us off.

02:37.908 --> 02:41.579
Hey, professor,
what kind of a crazy coin is this?

02:41.746 --> 02:45.666
It's part of an ancient
mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.

02:45.833 --> 02:49.670
Well, could you solve how I can
get a sandwich? I'm starving!

02:50.546 --> 02:53.341
- Me too!
- Why don't you kids run downtown...

02:53.507 --> 02:56.093
and bring back some sandwiches.
I'll buy.

02:56.260 --> 03:00.556
- That's a deal, professor.
- We'll be back in a jiff!

03:06.896 --> 03:08.564
What's that?

03:18.074 --> 03:21.077
My word! What could have done that?

03:21.243 --> 03:24.705
No! The Mummy of Anka is gone!

03:31.587 --> 03:34.090
Here you are, kids. The three hamburgers.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.133
And the sandwiches are coming up.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.552
Three liverwursts a la mode.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.262
One...

03:40.763 --> 03:42.264
two...

03:42.848 --> 03:44.266
three.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.768
Hey!

03:50.564 --> 03:53.609
- How much?
- That'll be a buck-fifty.

03:53.776 --> 03:57.613
Here you are.
$1.50 for a job well done.

03:59.448 --> 04:02.284
What kind of kooky 50-cent piece is this?

04:02.451 --> 04:05.413
Hey! That's the old Egyptian coin!

04:05.579 --> 04:07.123
Like, wow!

04:07.289 --> 04:09.959
I must have dropped it in my pocket
by accident.

04:10.126 --> 04:14.463
We'll give it to the professor later.
Grab the sandwiches, and let's go.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.341
Yeah. Like, I can't wait.

04:18.801 --> 04:23.305
Liverwurst and ice cream!
What'll they think of next?

04:29.645 --> 04:32.106
Professor. Professor, we're back.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.984
Hey, professor,
why are you sitting in the dark?

04:35.151 --> 04:37.987
- I'II get the lights.
- Okay.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.783
- Professor!
- Zoinks!

04:42.950 --> 04:44.285
What happened to him?

04:44.452 --> 04:48.289
Like, he's turned into 14-karat stone!

04:48.456 --> 04:50.166
Stone?

04:50.332 --> 04:53.127
There's only one person
who could've done that.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.336
The mummy!

04:54.503 --> 04:56.213
Mummy!

04:56.380 --> 04:58.174
Let's go check.

04:58.674 --> 05:02.511
Velma's right. The mummy's
not in the case. It's gone!

05:02.678 --> 05:05.473
And, like, right out
through that glass door.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.601
Wait a minute.
If he went out the door...

05:08.767 --> 05:12.313
how come the broken glass
is on the inside of the door?

05:12.480 --> 05:15.983
You're right, Velma. There's something
strange going on around here.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.361
Gosh! It looks like we've found
ourselves another mystery.

05:21.530 --> 05:22.865
And we're gonna solve it.

05:23.032 --> 05:26.869
The first thing we'd better do is split up
and search the school for clues.

05:27.036 --> 05:31.165
- Like, what kind of a clue?
- The mummy! What else?

05:34.710 --> 05:35.753
Shh!

05:35.920 --> 05:38.047
I don't know how we're gonna
find the mummy...

05:38.214 --> 05:40.049
with you two making so much noise.

05:40.216 --> 05:43.010
Make noise! That's the idea!
Right, Scooby?

05:43.177 --> 05:47.181
- Yeah! Yeah! Noise!
- That's not the idea.

05:47.348 --> 05:51.060
Now put that stuff in the closet
and come on!

05:51.519 --> 05:53.395
Spoilsport!

05:55.856 --> 05:57.733
Oh, thanks.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.533
Zoinks! The mummy!

06:06.909 --> 06:09.078
That does it! Punch my face, will you?

06:12.081 --> 06:15.209
- You found him!
- Yeah. He's locked in the closet.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.629
- Now what do we do?
- Run!

06:31.600 --> 06:33.936
Oh, no! We're back where we started!

06:34.103 --> 06:36.105
He's right behind us!

06:36.272 --> 06:37.606
Come on! Let's hide!

07:38.667 --> 07:40.669
Here we go again!

07:44.840 --> 07:47.343
Wow! What a time to find a locked door!

07:50.846 --> 07:52.181
Shoo! Go away!

07:53.349 --> 07:55.184
Yeah. Your mummy's calling you.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.980
Oh, no sense of humor, huh?

08:00.147 --> 08:04.026
- Coin! Coin!
- Coin?

08:04.193 --> 08:05.861
Okay. Like, here's a quarter.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.530
I'll bet he means that old Egyptian coin.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.786
Don't give it to him, Shaggy!

08:15.037 --> 08:16.580
Stop him, Scooby.

08:19.208 --> 08:23.337
- Not even for a Scooby Snack?
- Okay.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.173
The whole box?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.887
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

08:34.056 --> 08:35.557
Put them up! Put them up!

08:35.724 --> 08:38.227
Put them up! Put them up! Put them up!

08:50.114 --> 08:54.284
Thattaway, Scooby!
Give him the old karate treatment!

09:10.551 --> 09:14.096
How do you like that?
He danced out and deserted us.

09:14.263 --> 09:17.266
Yeah, but you gotta admit,
he wasn't bad.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.860
Coin! Coin!

09:28.944 --> 09:31.655
I guess we'll have to give him
the old coin, Shaggy.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.615
Yeah.

09:34.116 --> 09:38.370
Coin! Coin! Coin!

09:41.999 --> 09:45.127
- Good old Scooby!
- I knew he wouldn't let us down.

09:45.294 --> 09:50.215
Now let's go find Daphne and Freddy
and tell them we caught the mummy.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.641
Hey, Daphne, look!

09:59.808 --> 10:02.936
Footprints! And look how big they are!

10:03.103 --> 10:05.731
- They must be the mummy's.
- Come on. Let's follow.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.357
And stick close to me.

10:11.487 --> 10:15.491
The footprints disappear here, where
they're building an addition to the gym.

10:15.657 --> 10:19.703
Hey, look over there!
Isn't that Dr. Najib's car?

10:19.870 --> 10:22.873
Yeah. I thought he left hours ago.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.084
- Dr. Najib?
- Is he-?

10:26.835 --> 10:30.297
- He's turned to stone!
- Poor Dr. Najib!

10:30.464 --> 10:33.175
He must have met the mummy
before he could leave.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.220
I wonder if Shaggy and Velma
met him yet.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.101
He's gone! The mummy's gone!

10:43.268 --> 10:46.438
And he didn't even wait
till we found Fred and Daphne.

10:46.605 --> 10:50.108
Well, at least he left his calling card.

10:50.776 --> 10:54.488
It looks more like a piece of that tape
he's all wrapped up in to me.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.948
It is, Shaggy.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.826
But it sure doesn't feel
3000 years old to me.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.621
Come on. Let's go to the school lab
and test it.

11:06.750 --> 11:10.379
This test will tell us
just how old that tape really is.

11:10.546 --> 11:12.297
Well, come on, like, hurry.

11:12.464 --> 11:15.968
This place makes me so nervous
all I can think of is food.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.346
Me too!

11:29.231 --> 11:31.191
Ribbit. Ribbit.

11:36.613 --> 11:40.951
Now, let's see.
Where is the potassium disulfate?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.995
Oh, thanks. This should...

11:43.370 --> 11:47.040
Uh-oh. I wish I hadn't seen
what I think I saw.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.460
- Coin! Coin!
- Zoinks!

11:50.627 --> 11:54.548
It's the creepy coin collector again.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.342
Pardon me. It's time
for a smoke-screen exit.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.386
Like, let's get out of here.

12:01.597 --> 12:04.224
- Velma! Shaggy!
- What's going on?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.560
We got the mummy trapped inside.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.562
Groovy! But where's Scooby?

12:08.729 --> 12:12.441
Uh-oh. Like, he's trapped inside too.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.111
- Scooby?
- Mr. Mummy?

12:16.278 --> 12:19.406
- They're not here.
- We forgot about the back window.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.577
Then that creep must have Scooby!

12:23.744 --> 12:27.414
We better find him before he ends up
like the professor and Dr. Najib.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.249
Dr. Najib?

12:29.416 --> 12:32.085
We found him, solid as a rock.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.630
Poor Scooby!

12:36.131 --> 12:38.926
Scooby! Like, wow! Too late!

12:39.092 --> 12:42.846
He's gone to that big boneyard in the sky.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.018
Oh, my old pal!

12:48.185 --> 12:51.772
I'll never see his hungry face again!

12:51.939 --> 12:53.607
- Shaggy?
- Look, Scoob.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.984
You've been turned to stone!

13:06.036 --> 13:08.080
Wait a minute. Scooby!

13:08.246 --> 13:11.333
- You're all right!
- Yeah.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.377
Scooby-Doo!

13:14.336 --> 13:17.297
Okay. Cut it out. Cut it out.

13:17.464 --> 13:21.468
- Look! Shaggy's found Scooby!
- Yeah. Two of them.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.638
Get a load of this, gang.
Like, a stone one...

13:24.805 --> 13:26.807
and a real one.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.310
- I don't get it.
- I don't get a lot of things.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.772
Like why is the mummy after
that goofy old coin?

13:33.939 --> 13:35.983
Let's go to the professor's office.

13:36.149 --> 13:40.404
Maybe we can dig up some answers
to this mystery. Come on!

13:41.822 --> 13:44.616
Here. According
to the professor's research...

13:44.783 --> 13:48.286
not only was Anka the most feared
ruler of ancient Egypt...

13:48.453 --> 13:49.997
but the richest.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.167
Now, that's what I call
a riches-to-rags story!

13:55.127 --> 13:57.379
Riches-to-rags?

13:58.213 --> 14:01.633
- But what about the coin?
- I think I found something.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.845
Look at the design work
on the statue in this photo.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.514
- It looks like a picture puzzle to me.
- Right.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.852
And take a look at one of the pictures
in that puzzle when it's magnified.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.147
Wow! It's the same as the coin!

14:15.313 --> 14:17.524
So that's it!

14:21.903 --> 14:24.740
Uh-oh. Big, bad and bandaged is back!

14:27.159 --> 14:29.745
And he looks mad.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.539
Gangway! Class dismissed!

14:38.462 --> 14:40.547
We're safe here on the second floor.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.507
We can't let him get that coin.

14:43.925 --> 14:47.095
- Not quite safe enough.
- Quick! Into the wood shop.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.768
Uh-oh. Dead end!

14:54.519 --> 14:57.355
Quick, Daphne! The lights!
We'll lose him in the dark.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.740
Oh, no! Danger-prone Daphne
turned on the power saw!

15:13.205 --> 15:14.956
We're surrounded!

15:23.006 --> 15:24.758
We landed in the pool.

15:29.763 --> 15:33.100
Zoinks! Now that crazy saw is after us!

15:33.266 --> 15:35.560
Let's paddle out of here!

15:54.663 --> 15:59.501
- Phew! Well, we lost him.
- Yeah, and, like, I gotta rest.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.419
I'm tiredsville.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.631
And my feet are killing me.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.259
All one, two, three, four of them.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.805
Zoinks! The mummy!

16:28.488 --> 16:29.948
Hey, like, what's this?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.159
"Quick drying mold cement."

16:33.201 --> 16:34.494
And spray molds.

16:35.036 --> 16:39.040
Is that how the creep
made stone statues of everyone?

16:39.207 --> 16:40.500
Uh-huh.

16:41.877 --> 16:45.005
Uh-oh. Here we go again!

16:56.266 --> 17:00.020
Shh. I don't hear anything.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.525
Oh, I think we lost him.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.071
Zoinks!

17:10.238 --> 17:13.200
He's sealing us in!

17:14.201 --> 17:17.996
Coin! Coin! Coin! Coin!

17:24.294 --> 17:26.421
You shouldn't have done that, Scoob.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.715
Now he's really sore at us.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.678
What's that?

17:36.223 --> 17:38.725
Hey! It's the professor!

17:40.060 --> 17:44.189
- Are you all right, professor?
- I'm fine.

17:44.356 --> 17:47.234
Groovy. Be back for you later.

17:50.070 --> 17:53.782
Okay, Scoob. Start her up.
We're going out the back way.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.492
Right.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.087
Cut the switch!

18:09.923 --> 18:13.385
- There's Shaggy and Scooby!
- What are they doing with that mower?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.221
Turn it off!

18:20.976 --> 18:23.103
Uh-oh! Here comes creepy again!

18:23.270 --> 18:25.981
Quick. Hide in the gym
and lock the door.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.150
The mummy!

18:29.776 --> 18:31.778
I hope that baseball bat holds.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.953
- Like, what happened?
- You let the mummy in.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.454
And Scooby's with him!

18:53.883 --> 18:55.176
Scooby, look out!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.662
Wow! What a shot!

19:23.913 --> 19:27.500
Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

19:35.675 --> 19:38.345
Now let's see who's really
behind these bandages.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.183
Danm!

19:44.059 --> 19:48.188
So it was apparent that Dr. Najib
knew the secret of the coin.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.941
And after you kids left,
he broke in, hoping to steal it.

19:52.108 --> 19:55.528
But when I surprised him,
he had to tie me up in the shack.

19:55.820 --> 19:59.366
And when he couldn't find the coin,
he knew one of us must have it.

19:59.532 --> 20:04.037
So he devised this whole mummy plan
to scare us into giving it to him.

20:04.204 --> 20:08.625
But we wouldn't give it to him,
and later we figured out the secret.

20:09.459 --> 20:13.505
The coin fits into the design carved
on the back of the hippo like a key.

20:13.671 --> 20:17.550
This looks like the slot.
Now let's see what it unlocks.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.554
Wow!
A secret compartment...

20:21.721 --> 20:24.724
with a glass beetle in it!

20:25.266 --> 20:27.102
Not quite a glass beetle.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.646
It's Anka's most-valued treasure:

20:29.854 --> 20:34.609
- A diamond scarab worth a fortune.
- So that's what he was after.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.986
But there's still one thing unsolved.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.447
What happened to the real mummy?

20:44.077 --> 20:46.704
Zoinks! The mummy!

20:48.790 --> 20:50.417
Scooby-Doo!

20:50.583 --> 20:53.753
It's Scooby! And he found the mummy!

20:53.920 --> 20:57.757
Well, gang, I guess that wraps up
the mystery and the mummy too.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.803
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

21:53.980 --> 21:55.106
Shh!
