00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
-Ah!
- She looks excited!

00:08.049 --> 00:11.052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.347
It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.349
Oh!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.567
Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.279
My mission

00:29.362 --> 00:32.782
is to spark joy in the world
through tidying.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
Ching!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
<i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:41.583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:43.334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
The KonMari method is unique because

00:45.378 --> 00:48.214
I organize by category rather than
by location. In the KonMari method

00:48.298 --> 00:51.718
we tidy five categories in a
specific order.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
First, is clothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
I can't reach.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.849
Next, is books.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
Then, paper.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.439
I can't do the papers.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:12.614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

01:12.697 --> 01:13.740
and garage.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Everything miscellaneous.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.163
Finally, sentimental items.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.212
This is kinda hard.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.554
<i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
She wants to see this place turned around.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
This is amazing.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440
You're so cute! I love you!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.734
You're so cute I love you, too.
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.162
When you have young children

02:01.412 --> 02:04.916
maintaining a tidy household
is a struggle.

02:05.416 --> 02:08.711
In this episode we meet a couple
who have two young children

02:08.837 --> 02:10.713
and are struggling to keep
their house tidy

02:10.797 --> 02:12.841
Rachel and Kevin.

02:13.383 --> 02:17.846
The cluttered house seems to be affecting
their relationship as well.

02:18.263 --> 02:21.516
I would like to help this couple focus on
what matters most to them,

02:21.724 --> 02:24.394
time with their family.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.084
Big umbrellas are really great.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.469
Jaxon.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.430
Good job walking.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.890
...seven, eight, nine, ten!

03:03.433 --> 03:05.059
One, two, three, four, five, six,

03:05.143 --> 03:07.145
-seven, eight, nine ten!

03:08.688 --> 03:11.191
- Guess who's here.
- Come here. Let's go see.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.067
-Who is it?
- Hi!

03:13.234 --> 03:14.861
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you!

03:14.944 --> 03:16.779
-Oh my gosh, can we hug you?
-Hi.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.990
-Hello, I'm Marie.
-I'm so happy you're here.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.867
-Hi! So cute!
-This is Ryan.

03:20.950 --> 03:21.910
Say, "Hi, Marie."

03:22.035 --> 03:23.411
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Iida.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.829
Can I hug you, too?

03:24.954 --> 03:26.164
Nice to meet you.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.249
-This is Ryan, I'm Rachel.
-Nice to meet you.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.210
This is Kevin. Jaxon, say hi.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.961
-Oh, nice to meet you!
- Say hi.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.255
-He can be shy, he can be shy.
- You're shy?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.174
Coming over.
They came over!

03:37.717 --> 03:39.052
They came over to see us.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.803
Do you want me to hold you?

03:40.887 --> 03:42.096
You want to go to her?

03:42.180 --> 03:43.640
Wanna go to her.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.433
-Oh!
-Wanna to go her.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.185
I feel so happy!

03:47.268 --> 03:49.771
- Good. Oh, good.
- We're excited, we're excited.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.193
-We're the Friends.
-We're the Friend family.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.654
That's our-- Our last name is Friend,
we're the Friend family.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.781
We're friends, too,
but we're also the Friend family.

03:59.864 --> 04:00.698
Yeah.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.867
And what do you wanna say about us, babe?

04:03.785 --> 04:04.953
I don't know, we're...

04:05.787 --> 04:07.038
Uh, we're fun.

04:07.622 --> 04:08.581
-I'm fun.
-We get--

04:09.165 --> 04:10.708
-He's fun, too, though.
-Thank you.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.961
<i>We were married five years ago.</i>

04:13.169 --> 04:15.880
<i>Kevin's like a natural romantic</i>
<i>and he's super thoughtful.</i>
<i>What I love about him is that</i>
<i>if I'm really passionate about something,</i>

04:18.800 --> 04:21.052
<i>or want to get something done, like,</i>
<i>he's on board with me.</i>

04:21.177 --> 04:24.514
<i>Rachel always has one thing</i>
<i>on her mind and that's enjoying her life.</i>

04:24.597 --> 04:25.932
<i>She's super quick-witted,</i>

04:26.015 --> 04:28.601
always wants to laugh,
always wants to make you laugh.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.853
I love that about her.
She's a great mom.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.730
I want the yellow!

04:32.814 --> 04:33.690
Oh...

04:33.773 --> 04:35.942
<i>She's, uh... She's pretty amazing.</i>

04:36.317 --> 04:37.568
She's got amazing eyes.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.864
- Okay, then fine, I want--
-♪ <i>W, X ♪</i>

04:41.948 --> 04:42.782
Hold on.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.075
<i>♪ Y and Z ♪</i>

04:44.158 --> 04:45.451
-We're almost there.
-Okay.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.330
<i>♪ Now I know my ABCs... ♪</i>

04:50.123 --> 04:52.125
<i>We have two kids, two great kids.</i>

04:52.208 --> 04:54.335
<i>-Four and two.</i>
- <i>Jaxon and Ryan.</i>

04:54.460 --> 04:56.421
<i>We had wanted kids, we planned for 'em.</i>

04:56.504 --> 04:57.380
But...

04:57.547 --> 05:01.467
kids and work, ever since that,
things are hard to do.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.470
<i>I feel like our house is a home,</i>

05:04.554 --> 05:07.432
<i>but I feel like it's a constant</i>
<i>struggle to be.</i>

05:07.849 --> 05:10.935
<i>This place that we originally</i>
<i>really liked and we moved into,</i>

05:11.019 --> 05:13.271
<i>we find that there's just kind of</i>
<i>so much stuff</i>

05:13.354 --> 05:15.064
<i>and we end up getting frustrated</i>
<i>about it.</i>

05:15.148 --> 05:16.024
<i>Yes.</i>

05:16.274 --> 05:19.152
He's definitely cleaner than I am. Okay?

05:19.527 --> 05:21.529
I'm-- Okay, I'm not a super dirty person,

05:21.612 --> 05:25.366
but when it comes to throwing my clothes
over here and letting them pile up

05:25.450 --> 05:27.660
and leaving laundry for a while,
that's me.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.620
<i>Kevin was definitely more organized.</i>

05:29.746 --> 05:32.081
<i>So I feel like I came in</i>
<i>and just wrecked that ship.</i>

05:32.165 --> 05:35.251
Right, babe? But there-- But there is
so much good that came with that bad.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.294
-Right?
-Right.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.420
-Okay.
-Yeah.

05:37.837 --> 05:38.963
We got two kids out of it.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.007
-That's the answer for everything.
-Thanks, babe.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.511
Can you guys come in?
We'll come show you, come this way.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.639
-Come in here.
- This is the room.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.391
-This is the room.
- Yay!

05:50.475 --> 05:51.684
This is the room.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.519
The children's room.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.688
- Your room?
-So, this is the kids' playroom.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.690
This is the kids' playroom.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.317
We have a bunch of toys.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.528
Marie, this is also Kevin's closet.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.322
-In the playroom.
- Ah!

06:04.405 --> 06:06.032
So this is...
my dresser drawers.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.495
-And then this side over here...
-What else?

06:10.578 --> 06:13.456
This is where my shirts are hanging.
Work shirts and then, like, coats.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.376
And then my shoes
are all down over there.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.794
-Ah!

06:17.877 --> 06:20.380
-That's where my shoes go.
-She's like, "Oh, that's a big no-no!"

06:20.463 --> 06:21.506
What? Yeah.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.800
Do the kids know how to clean already?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.969
-Your kids, they know how to tidy already?
- They don't.

06:27.053 --> 06:31.015
I think if we make a game
out of it sometimes, they'll do it.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.935
What do you--? You have kids.
What do you do with your kids?

06:35.228 --> 06:38.815
She just watches me
have so much fun tidying all the time

06:38.898 --> 06:40.274
that she just learned from me.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.361
All right, if we can find a way
to have fun tidying up,

06:43.444 --> 06:44.570
like on a regular basis,

06:44.654 --> 06:46.572
I think they'll feed off that, for sure.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.409
- Let's move on to the next room?
- Yes, yes.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.285
Our room is small.

06:51.369 --> 06:55.039
Here's one closet, here's this closet.
Both of them are mine.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.542
- Can she look inside?

06:57.625 --> 06:59.752
Absolutely,
you can do whatever you want.

07:01.045 --> 07:04.340
So, how do you separate them?
In categories, or...?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.968
Um, I think-- So, I don't do it.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.803
We have someone help us do it,

07:08.886 --> 07:10.805
-like a laundry person.

07:10.888 --> 07:11.931
Oh, I see.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.558
'Cause I hate doing laundry.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.685
We fight about laundry.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.020
And it seems silly when I say it,

07:18.479 --> 07:22.191
but really, it pisses me off, like, a lot.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.611
It's not because
she doesn't do the laundry,

07:25.736 --> 07:28.698
it's because we hire somebody
to come do it.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.325
It's not like I'm saying, "Hey...

07:31.534 --> 07:34.245
You do the laundry, you watch the kids,
you do the dishes."

07:34.370 --> 07:36.372
-No, I know.
-I'm saying, no,  we gotta do this,

07:36.456 --> 07:38.040
but let's do this as a family, like--

07:38.124 --> 07:40.209
Hold on, babe.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.170
-Okay, hold on a second.
-I'm ready.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.797
With him working more,
I'm home with the kids more,

07:44.881 --> 07:46.757
and it's freaking chaos.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.135
My kids are just like
running around and being crazy

07:49.218 --> 07:50.720
and we never get anything done.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.389
So I think to myself,
"What's an easy resolution?"

07:53.848 --> 07:55.308
If we don't have enough time,

07:55.391 --> 07:58.102
then maybe we can pay somebody
to do these things,

07:58.227 --> 07:59.562
and that way we have more time.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.023
It's because we're perfectly capable
of doing those things.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.983
Okay, time out.
I'm not saying we're not capable.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.903
I'm just saying the reason
that this came up more and more

08:06.986 --> 08:09.405
was because, babe, we don't have
the time to do these,

08:09.489 --> 08:10.364
that's where it came.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.407
We're different.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.163
This is the kids' room.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.499
So we have things under the bed.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.292
-For them, the little bins.
- Daddy!

08:21.375 --> 08:24.212
-'Cause they don't have much closet space.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.714
It must be hard to find things in here.

08:26.797 --> 08:27.715
Oh, yeah.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.218
I think I can make this easier to use.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.513
I do like the rack, but I think
we can fix it so that it's easier to use.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.765
- Oh, my God!

08:35.848 --> 08:37.391
-Was that planned
- Please be careful!

08:37.475 --> 08:39.644
- Oh, my God.
- Marie started tripping!

08:40.102 --> 08:42.188
We have too much stuff. It's official.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.023
-It's official.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.734
-Did you just fall?
-I just fell!

08:46.817 --> 08:48.778
-I'll go food shopping.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.821
Okay, you go shopping for food.
Okay.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.490
I have a real problem in here.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.451
When I go to get clothes for the kids,

08:55.618 --> 08:57.161
half the stuff I grab...

08:57.537 --> 08:58.704
is not the right size.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.623
It's either too small or too big.

09:00.706 --> 09:01.999
But Marie, I'll tell you...

09:02.083 --> 09:03.793
-Want my mom.
-Okay, I'm coming.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.920
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Yes, I hear you.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.922
-Yes?
- Mom, I want boobies.

09:08.005 --> 09:11.008
-We're gonna do boobies in just a minute.
- What is "boobie"?

09:11.092 --> 09:14.303
- For breastfeeding.
- Oh, that's what it is!

09:14.387 --> 09:15.429
Yes, yes, um...

09:15.763 --> 09:18.140
I want to sit on the floor with you.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.684
You can sit-- Okay.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.019
KonMari chair.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.359
So both of you work?

09:28.442 --> 09:29.485
He mostly works.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.697
I teach Intercultural Communication,
a few days a week,

09:32.822 --> 09:34.782
but I'm mostly home with the kids.

09:34.865 --> 09:38.452
So, I was gonna say, ever since I had kids
was when I started to get really, like,

09:38.536 --> 09:41.497
anxious about the house being, um...

09:42.623 --> 09:43.916
not organized.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.210
I'm 50-60 hours a week, yeah.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.421
And then sometimes on the weekends, um,

09:48.504 --> 09:51.257
I'm a sales manager for
a restaurant supply company.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.050
So it becomes hectic

09:53.134 --> 09:55.219
-and you have little energy.
- Yeah.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.721
-And you have little time.
-Yeah.
And then it becomes, like,

09:58.306 --> 10:00.433
"All right, are you cleaning this up?
Am I doing this?"

10:01.559 --> 10:04.562
The biggest fights we ever get into
are money and cleaning.

10:04.645 --> 10:08.899
Rachel and the kids are definitely not
getting the best side of me.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.778
That always has stuff piled up
and that's, like, medicine...

10:12.862 --> 10:15.489
-I know, the medicine cabinet's up there.
-There's makeup over there.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.617
-Like, none of that stuff goes there.
-Okay.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.077
There are five--
There are seven pillows on this bed!

10:20.244 --> 10:22.788
-I know, we each have one...
-Those aren't even decorative pillows.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.500
I want to be a good dad,
but I don't know.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.211
I don't know that I'm doing
that well with it.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.130
Because I'm tired,

10:31.213 --> 10:33.924
because I'm frustrated sometimes
about the house.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.676
You know?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.054
Among other things. And...

10:38.846 --> 10:40.681
Oh,, man, that sucks.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.975
That sucks to say.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.853
That they're getting the worst of me,
sometimes.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.438
Hmm.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.609
-It seems like everything is so short.

10:51.692 --> 10:55.279
And so-- And there's not enough time
for us to just enjoy our lives.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.489
-Yeah.
-You know what I mean?

10:58.699 --> 11:01.327
I completely empathize,
it's a busy time for you.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.288
Even my house gets cluttered sometimes.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.539
I don't believe you.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.335
-Just between you.
- Okay.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.087
-Do you want to see another one?

11:11.170 --> 11:12.505
Let's continue on.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.715
Okay come in here. Come on in.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.553
American kitchens are so large!

11:19.637 --> 11:20.971
They are? This is large?

11:25.393 --> 11:27.603
The kitchen in Japan, probably...

11:27.687 --> 11:28.813
-Yes.
-Around here...

11:28.896 --> 11:31.440
-When I used to live by myself.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.817
Wow!

11:33.234 --> 11:34.276
Mom!

11:34.360 --> 11:35.319
Yes, honey.
Jaxon!

11:38.614 --> 11:40.908
I mean, are your kids running all over?

11:40.991 --> 11:43.661
Or are they just sitting saying,
"Mommy, whatever you tell me to do,

11:43.744 --> 11:44.662
I'll do it."

11:44.745 --> 11:46.580
Nooo!

11:46.956 --> 11:49.959
- So, yeah, that's our silverware.
-Silverware, ah.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.711
What's this?

11:52.128 --> 11:55.423
So, we go through a lot of dishes.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.883
-So this is actually good.
-Mhm.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.385
-Most of the time,

11:59.468 --> 12:02.888
there's dishes here,
there's other things piled there.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.308
Does this clutter
stress you out?

12:06.392 --> 12:07.351
Yes.

12:07.852 --> 12:12.064
This room is just, like, the worst room.
One of the worst ones.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.900
You walk in and it's, like,
when it's not organized, it's annoying.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.611
<i>I don't know what it is</i>
<i>about the kitchen.</i>

12:17.695 --> 12:19.864
<i>Honestly, I feel like</i>
<i>I can never keep it clean.</i>

12:20.030 --> 12:22.825
It was really after I had kids
that everything just came full front.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.201
I'm like, I can't do all this.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.203
I want my Mommy!

12:26.537 --> 12:28.164
No!

12:28.289 --> 12:30.541
<i>Whether I'm constantly</i>
<i>feeding the kids snacks,</i>

12:30.624 --> 12:32.877
<i>and then those moments</i>
<i>I go and bring the plates in there,</i>

12:32.960 --> 12:34.462
<i>but I'm switching and they're yelling,</i>

12:34.545 --> 12:37.047
<i>and really washing</i>
<i>and putting things away is unrealistic.</i>

12:37.131 --> 12:38.841
<i>And then things would, like, load up more.</i>

12:38.924 --> 12:41.135
<i>I don't necessarily know how to fix it</i>
<i>and it affects me.</i>

12:41.218 --> 12:43.387
So, we're on board, we want to change.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.765
I just want it to be strong enough
to change me.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.768
You guys, come get comfortable.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.103
They are tired, time for a nap.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.066
Okay, then...

12:58.110 --> 13:00.654
I'd love to greet your house first.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.072
- I love that.
-I'm excited.

13:02.615 --> 13:07.119
So would you like to
try it with me?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.037
Sure.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.207
You can do it in your mind...

13:11.332 --> 13:13.000
All we're communicating
to the house

13:13.083 --> 13:16.378
is that we're thanking it, first of all,
for always protecting you,

13:16.462 --> 13:18.756
and that we are about to begin
this process of tidying.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.258
Now I'm finding spot.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.385
Okay. Maybe...

13:24.804 --> 13:25.930
Okay.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.526
- Close your eyes.
-Okay.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.484
- Okay we're finished.
- Thank you very much.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.239
You know, what's funny is
I obviously have never done that

14:25.322 --> 14:26.740
or thought of doing that,

14:26.866 --> 14:28.951
and it is nice to go,

14:29.243 --> 14:32.496
"Yeah, this has been
a very good home for us."

14:35.249 --> 14:38.294
Then I also got a sense of,
"Are we doing it justice?"

14:38.752 --> 14:39.879
You know what I mean?

14:40.212 --> 14:42.381
I don't know, like,
why I'm getting emotional, but...

14:42.798 --> 14:44.258
I think he knows, I just--

14:45.301 --> 14:48.345
I want things to be, like, more simple,
so I don't have to be so stressed,

14:48.429 --> 14:49.388
but then..

14:49.471 --> 14:51.515
I don't know how to fix it.
It's-- You know?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.517
So I'm, I'm happy that you're here

14:53.934 --> 14:55.936
'cause I want to feel, like, more calm.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.397
I want to appreciate, like, what I have

14:58.480 --> 15:00.566
instead of needing more things, you know?

15:01.317 --> 15:03.736
Thank you for, like, being here for us

15:03.819 --> 15:05.905
and wanting to help us
'cause I'm ready for it.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.781
I know that we're ready for it.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.992
Thank you, I'm grateful
for you saying that.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.622
The ultimate goal of tidying

15:14.705 --> 15:17.583
is really to learn to cherish
everything that you have,

15:17.666 --> 15:20.085
so that you can achieve happiness
for your family

15:20.169 --> 15:21.879
so that you can live comfortably.

15:24.506 --> 15:28.052
So, with those visions
in our hearts, let's begin tidying.

15:28.177 --> 15:31.347
Yeah, do you want to put them in bed
and then whatever we need to do?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.057
- Yeah.
-Okay, perfect.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.893
Shh, shh, shh.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.356
What is your impression of this family?

15:40.898 --> 15:44.985
I feel they are a warm and loving family

15:45.069 --> 15:47.363
the moment I entered the house.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.823
<i>The kids are so cute as well.</i>

15:49.907 --> 15:51.825
<i>So cute!</i>
<i>They really are soothing.</i>

15:51.909 --> 15:53.118
<i>You're absolutely right.</i>

15:54.411 --> 15:56.246
<i>I think this house will become</i>
<i>even more lovely.</i>

15:56.330 --> 15:58.082
It's lovely now, of course,
but even more so.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.125
I know things will be better.
I'm looking forward to it.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.806
Take all the clothes from
everywhere in the house

16:14.223 --> 16:16.725
and pile it into one big mountain.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.227
-Oh.
-Right now?

16:18.310 --> 16:21.063
Rachel, here, Kevin,
in the living room.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.399
All of your clothes, right now.
Every single piece.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.068
-Oh, my gosh.
-I'm grabbing everything from my closets

16:26.151 --> 16:27.695
and putting it in here?

16:27.778 --> 16:29.780
-And your drawers.
- The bed is good.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.074
-The bed would be great. Just pull it out.
-Oh, my God!

16:32.157 --> 16:34.994
- Let's begin with that.
-And let's create a pile.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.453
-All right, let's do it.
-Okay.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.248
Oh, my God, babe, no...

16:39.790 --> 16:41.375
Oh, my God.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.838
It is awesome to look
at this pile all at once.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.007
I mean, I get it, Marie, you look sweet,

16:48.090 --> 16:50.676
but on the inside
you really mean business.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.386
Yes, I might be.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.847
- You might be?

16:56.265 --> 16:58.892
My husband's gonna question
why he married me now.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.271
Oh, my gosh, this is awesome.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.399
That's it. Those are just scarves.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.651
Okay.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.573
Oh, my gosh.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.496
This is embarrassing.

17:19.580 --> 17:23.000
I don't know why it's embarrassing,
but for some reason I have so much stuff.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.127
-No, it's insane.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.129
I'm just looking at things
I don't even know.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.048
One, I feel like I don't need this.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.717
And two, I feel like there's<i> </i>people
who don't have--

17:31.800 --> 17:33.677
I don't know why, like,
I started feeling guilty.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.846
I actually feel kind of
uncomfortable right now.
I'm getting hot and cold. I really do.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.224
It's weird.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.065
Only when you actually
are confronted

17:46.148 --> 17:49.234
with how much exactly you have,
you start to realize,

17:49.651 --> 17:51.236
yeah, what you need to do.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.114
Okay. Great.

17:54.281 --> 17:58.994
So from here you will choose
what you will keep.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.831
You will only keep items that
spark joy for you.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.251
The important
is to hold each item one by one.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.586
Okay. Oh, my gosh.

18:07.669 --> 18:11.548
When you touch the item
that sparks joy for you...

18:11.632 --> 18:12.466
Okay.

18:12.549 --> 18:13.842
...um, you feel...

18:14.218 --> 18:15.552
-Ching!
-Okay.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.013
Ching! Okay, okay.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.099
All of your cells are rising.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.642
Yes, okay, wow.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.942
Do you know what it feels
like when you spark joy?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.528
You feel it when you hold a puppy,

18:32.611 --> 18:35.405
or when you wear your favorite outfit.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.908
It's a warm and positive feeling.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.952
That's how it feels  when something
"sparks joy."

18:40.452 --> 18:44.289
Some of you may not know
how that feels yet

18:44.623 --> 18:45.874
but please do not worry.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.918
Your sensitivity to joy

18:48.001 --> 18:51.171
will be honed as you progress
through the tidying process.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.133
-Are we ready?

18:54.216 --> 18:56.260
So weird.
This first thing you picked up,

18:56.343 --> 18:58.846
I definitely don't really want this,
I could tell.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.309
When you let go of an item,
you must thank it.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.812
- Thank you.
-Thank you for letting me wear you.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.397
- Yeah!
-I like that, okay.

19:09.815 --> 19:10.899
These guys...

19:11.441 --> 19:12.901
-I like these.
-Mhm.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.696
Yes, these are really comfortable,
I wear these a lot.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.240
-So...

19:18.323 --> 19:19.575
Okay, they spark joy.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.202
Okay, I don't know what this is.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.789
I'm already looking at it and knowing
I don't want it, so thank you.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.000
My God, I could've got rid
of all of these.
- Be gentle, though!

19:30.335 --> 19:32.963
-Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!

19:33.046 --> 19:34.673
Thank you, let me put this in.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.593
- These ones...

19:37.676 --> 19:40.470
So, you continue on,
and let's move on to Kevin.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.639
-Oh.
-Perfect. Good luck, babe.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.641
-Have fun. Jeez.
-Thank you.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.394
No. Thank you.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.688
- And do the same thing.
- Okay.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.649
Wow this is heavy.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.696
Same thing for you, Kevin.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.239
- Okay.
- Same process.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.367
Okay, this shirt I have absolutely
no attachment to.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.994
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.246
Uh-oh.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.917
- Oh, really?

20:10.250 --> 20:11.835
-Babe.
-This is an old shirt.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.795
-But this shirt...
- Just stop.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.131
...is so comfortable. I love this shirt.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.758
When's the last time you wore it?

20:20.844 --> 20:24.264
Rachel, as a rule, focus only
the clothes that belongs to you.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.975
I'm sorry. Okay. It's just hard when--
Okay.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.565
When folding, it's important
to convey love to your clothes

20:33.690 --> 20:35.442
from the palms of your hands.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.569
By doing this, you will start to
like folding clothes.

20:38.195 --> 20:42.074
Folding is not just
making your clothes smaller.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.160
It is actually an important opportunity

20:45.244 --> 20:47.955
to talk to your clothes and thank them.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.123
By repeating this,

20:50.207 --> 20:52.668
you'll learn to love folding.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.835
Wow.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.798
So what you're aiming for

20:57.881 --> 21:00.926
is to create a rectangle
at the center of the clothes.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.679
Fold in half.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.311
After this, in the end,

21:11.687 --> 21:14.398
fold into thirds.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.319
And you should
be aiming for this small rectangle.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.029
- It's so little.
- Wow.

21:21.446 --> 21:24.283
We will store these
standing in the drawer.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.742
Oh, my gosh, okay.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.869
- So, can you try with me?

21:27.953 --> 21:31.498
-Oh! Sure, okay.
-You should tuck in the sleeves first.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.083
I feel like I did it too far.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.585
You should fold that back once.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.796
- Oh, come back.
- Come back.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.757
Okay, so this way? Or all the way?
-Leave a little gap at the bottom.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.972
Your folding will
end up smoother with the gap.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.348
-This looks good?
-Yeah.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.225
Oh, my God.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.644
I mean, it's kinda messy.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.688
That's better than you've
ever done before.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.733
Babe, yours looks so good!

22:00.652 --> 22:01.903
Jeans, like this.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.699
It's quite simple, just fold in half.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.452
And fold in half.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.746
And fold in thirds.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.748
Oh, thirds as well.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.751
And standing.

22:16.043 --> 22:16.960
Oh.

22:17.085 --> 22:19.546
Oh, that's gonna make me
be able to see all those jeans.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.174
-Oh, my God, I'm excited.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.012
So, you will be doing
this folding method

22:27.095 --> 22:28.764
for all the clothes
you've decided to keep.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.768
The clothes that you've folded,
try stacking them in your drawers nicely.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.102
Like, when the kids are here,

22:34.186 --> 22:36.104
even though I want to include them,

22:36.646 --> 22:37.773
like, how do we--

22:37.856 --> 22:39.858
how do we get all this stuff done,
like...?

22:42.986 --> 22:45.864
I highly recommend doing this
with your kids. They love it.

22:46.239 --> 22:50.077
Like reading a book, it's
a habit to fold clothes with my children.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.496
We often do it together before bedtime.

22:52.829 --> 22:56.792
Of course, sometimes
when I fold clothes,

22:56.875 --> 22:58.835
my daughters crush.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.587
So, what do you do in those times?

23:00.670 --> 23:02.923
I do scold them.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.216
I ask them not to pull it out.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.802
Of course I tell them not to pull it out.

23:06.885 --> 23:07.928
Well, shoot. Okay.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.264
So, yeah, just try.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.975
Yeah. No, we gotta to see
how it works for us, you're right.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.937
Don't let us fail, okay?
Hold us accountable.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.190
-I will be, don't worry.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.359
Well, thank you.
Thank you for coming into our home.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.194
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

23:24.277 --> 23:26.613
You're welcome, we're gonna see you
next week. I'm excited.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.031
-Thank you.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.741
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.119
- Bye, guys, be safe.
- Bye! Thank you!

23:32.202 --> 23:33.286
Thank you so much.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.288
Take care. Drive safe.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.373
Yeah. Bye!

23:37.833 --> 23:38.875
Oh, my God.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.753
I definitely am nervous.
We have a lot of stuff.

23:46.049 --> 23:49.010
Are you still focused
on what gives you joy?

23:49.094 --> 23:52.097
I can be focused and overwhelmed
at the same time.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.098
Okay, good. That's it.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.975
I'll tell you what's not bringing me joy

23:55.058 --> 23:56.935
is that I have to fold,
I'll be honest with you.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.979
Can I say something else?

23:59.187 --> 24:01.189
Yes, I know, yours is easier than mine.
-That's not--
-I know, but okay.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.694
I'm just gonna say it,
I hate laundry, okay?

24:05.986 --> 24:07.320
That actually gives me anxiety.

24:07.654 --> 24:10.949
<i>But I know that if Kevin and I</i>
<i>continue our habits,</i>

24:11.032 --> 24:12.993
<i>my kids are gonna be the exact same.</i>

24:13.452 --> 24:15.412
And so if I could think
of giving them something

24:15.495 --> 24:18.290
to allow them to take care
of their lives, put it in order,

24:18.790 --> 24:20.709
that's enough motivation for me too.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.836
How about this, do you like this?

24:22.919 --> 24:24.754
-Yeah.
- Oh, me too!

24:25.130 --> 24:28.008
Okay, Ryan, what about this guy?

24:28.383 --> 24:30.177
-No.
-Good job!

24:30.552 --> 24:32.637
-Say thank you.
-Thank you.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.015
-We got to put it away.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.725
<i>I wet my pants.</i>

24:36.808 --> 24:38.435
You would put water on your pants?

24:38.518 --> 24:40.729
All over your shirt?
Oh, is that the coffee?

24:41.146 --> 24:42.272
Oh, man.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.859
-You had a rough day.
-I want a napkin.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.737
I don't think a napkin's gonna do it, man!

24:48.987 --> 24:50.113
- Kev?
-What?

24:50.197 --> 24:52.532
Do we have a bin
to put a bunch of hangers in?

24:52.782 --> 24:55.035
I have a ton of hangers
I don't want us to throw away.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.119
Oh, oh, we got--

24:56.203 --> 24:58.079
-You don't want to throw 'em away?
-Honey...

24:58.163 --> 25:00.874
We shouldn't get rid of hangers.
Those are-- We paid money for those.

25:00.957 --> 25:03.376
If we don't use them,
we'll have one little spot in the garage.

25:03.460 --> 25:07.047
Do you use 200 hangers
with no clothes to put hangers on--?

25:07.130 --> 25:09.966
Maybe she'll-- Will you use them?
Do they bring you joy?

25:10.217 --> 25:13.261
-Babe, you don't even know--
-A bin full of hangers brings you joy?

25:13.345 --> 25:16.348
Hold on, do they keep you up at night
that we have hangers in the garage?

25:16.598 --> 25:19.893
<i>Rachel and I, before the kids,</i>
<i>there was a little less tension.</i>

25:20.352 --> 25:22.646
A little less frustration,
a little more sleep.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.857
You know, and so things
were a little bit easier.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.735
If you buy more clothes to fill that up,
we're gonna have a problem.

25:28.818 --> 25:31.071
-Hey. Okay, guess what?

25:34.032 --> 25:37.702
I hope that this will get out of the way

25:37.786 --> 25:41.331
the things that are keeping us
from enjoying each other.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.750
Because we really--
We do, we talk about it.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.585
You know, we "talk about it."

25:45.835 --> 25:47.462
And then there's just no time.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.381
There's no time or energy.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.024
You brought a lot of stuff today.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.945
Yes, I did. I just
brought boxes from my house.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.239
- Honey!
- Don't clean your room!

26:14.322 --> 26:15.574
Just go through the clothes.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.826
What are you talking about,
"cleaning my room?"

26:17.909 --> 26:20.120
You don't have to get
everything out.

26:20.203 --> 26:23.331
That was her rule!
She said get everything out onto a pile.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.249
-Oop.

26:26.876 --> 26:30.463
- Marie!
- Hi! What is this?

26:30.547 --> 26:32.882
-Hi! We're so excited you're here!
-Hi, hi.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.551
- Come in.
-Good to see you.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.303
What is this
and why are you holding a box?

26:36.386 --> 26:38.179
I figured that today,

26:38.263 --> 26:41.141
you'd need to store little things.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.809
-Oh, my goodness.
- What is this?

26:42.892 --> 26:45.520
We'll be taking care
of the storage of miscellaneous items,

26:45.604 --> 26:47.814
so I thought these might come in handy.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.696
Miscellaneous items include

26:54.779 --> 26:57.240
everything except

26:57.324 --> 26:59.326
clothes, books, documents,
and sentimental items.

26:59.701 --> 27:04.164
I always use boxes when tidying
miscellaneous items.

27:04.414 --> 27:08.418
By using boxes, you can
compartmentalize

27:08.585 --> 27:10.587
the drawers neatly.

27:14.049 --> 27:17.302
So I think we're gonna focus
on the kitchen and the garage today.

27:17.385 --> 27:19.346
So, how about, Rachel,
you focus on the kitchen

27:19.429 --> 27:20.847
and, Kevin, you'll do the garage.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.522
Let's proceed with utensils
you use to cook with.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.400
Little tools like this, everything.
Out on the counter.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.693
I'll do that first.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.321
So I'll stay in here
and then you guys take Kevin?

27:36.404 --> 27:37.697
Yes, Kevin will tidy the garage.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.699
Okay, good luck.
-See you soon.
-Bye.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.913
-Bye.
- Bye.

27:47.540 --> 27:51.211
What category of things
do you have in here?

27:51.294 --> 27:53.046
yWill you give us a general idea?

27:53.129 --> 27:57.008
Most of this is just random stuff.

27:57.133 --> 28:00.762
In that case,
let's take everything out of here as well.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.102
When you tidy your garage,

28:07.185 --> 28:09.562
you should take everything out.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.690
<i>Then sort the items into categories.</i>

28:12.232 --> 28:13.817
<i>If you encounter sentimental items</i>

28:13.942 --> 28:15.944
<i>while tidying,</i>

28:16.152 --> 28:18.613
I recommend that you address them last,

28:18.738 --> 28:20.740
when your sensitivity to joy has
become sufficiently heightened.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.619
So your garage at home...

28:25.412 --> 28:27.956
-How simple is it?

28:28.081 --> 28:29.290
In my garage?

28:29.666 --> 28:32.585
Just my Christmas decorations.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.753
Wow, okay.

28:35.463 --> 28:38.717
That's not to say I'm perfect.
I do have a section in my garage

28:38.800 --> 28:40.301
where I just kind of keep things

28:40.385 --> 28:42.721
that I meant to store,
but it's temporary space.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.890
All right, I feel a little bit better,
but I'm gonna go at it.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.225
I'm gonna go after it.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.644
Let's keep moving along.

28:50.311 --> 28:53.231
The box is for all the photos...

28:53.982 --> 28:56.568
Marie, there's so much
just junk here, it's crazy.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.155
These cords are all tangled.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.072
Yeah.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.825
Do you wish that you had more

29:03.908 --> 29:05.910
personal items in your house?

29:05.994 --> 29:07.912
The only thing that I do...

29:08.955 --> 29:13.168
definitely want in the house
is picture frames of the kids,

29:13.251 --> 29:15.003
so that's something that we keep saying,

29:15.086 --> 29:17.630
"Okay, we got to get that,
we got to do that," and we just don't.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.592
And, so, that's something that
I don't want to put off anymore.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.761
- Wow.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.679
These can go bye-bye.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.641
Oh, my gosh, this is so lovely.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.435
-This is from your wedding?

29:30.518 --> 29:33.646
Yeah, it's the--
made a little video out of it.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.399
-Yeah.
- It's so beautiful.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.778
Do you ever watch this?

29:40.028 --> 29:42.739
Like, after our first year,
first anniversary, we watched it.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.245
Today's my wedding anniversary, actually.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.456
Today's your anniversary?
Happy anniversary! What?
-Thank you!
-Oh, wow!

29:53.750 --> 29:57.128
Today we are apart since I
am working, so this made me a bit jealous.

29:57.212 --> 30:00.089
-Oh, really?
- He's not with me today.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.926
-Wow.
- I miss him.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.721
Wow, I have not seen that
in at least four years.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.264
We were married five years ago.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.977
<i>So think maybe</i>
<i>we watched it once, a year in,</i>

30:13.061 --> 30:16.773
<i>and then it got tucked away</i>
<i>along with pictures of my kids and...</i>

30:16.898 --> 30:20.318
<i>It doesn't feel good having</i>
<i>that stuff tucked away.</i>

30:21.569 --> 30:23.404
<i>We're at a time in our life,</i>

30:23.488 --> 30:26.658
<i>Rachel and I, where it's too easy</i>
<i>to be on the go all the time</i>

30:26.741 --> 30:29.285
and then not realize that you're
just slowly, like...

30:29.869 --> 30:31.538
you know, sort of falling--

30:31.621 --> 30:33.873
like, working apart, growing apart.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.835
<i>It's probably that time now</i>
<i>when it's most important</i>

30:36.918 --> 30:38.795
<i>to stay strong and to work together</i>

30:38.878 --> 30:41.422
<i>instead of, kind of,</i>
<i>fighting against each other...</i>

30:41.840 --> 30:44.425
in the midst of all of that stuff
that we're dealing with.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.888
Hi!

30:49.055 --> 30:49.889
Hi!

30:50.431 --> 30:52.851
This is where I'm at so far.
So I emptied this out.

30:53.017 --> 30:56.145
I made sure every one of them
that I had, had a top to it.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.275
-Very good.
-Okay.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.652
to organize it.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.865
Yes, I do agree that this is a good spot
for them.

31:06.948 --> 31:07.782
Oh, okay.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.745
Let's stand everything upright.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.832
When you stack them up like this,

31:15.915 --> 31:19.252
you can see, in one shot,
how much you have.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.838
Standing up when possible. Yes, I like it.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.006
To be honest,

31:23.089 --> 31:26.426
the kitchen I'm a little nervous
because I'm in here so much making stuff.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.555
How do I really keep it up when this place
is where a lot of things happen?

31:33.016 --> 31:36.311
Approach it in a lighter way
'cause it's never going to be perfect.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.395
But with that said,

31:37.478 --> 31:41.190
it'll help immensely if you have
a designated spot for everything.

31:41.691 --> 31:45.111
Is there ever a time where there
are things out of order at your house?

31:45.194 --> 31:47.447
-Of course.

31:48.740 --> 31:52.577
In fact, if I'm really
exhausted, I'll just go to sleep.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.662
Okay, I like this.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.416
But we have a lot to cover, so...

31:58.499 --> 32:00.752
I know, I am still excited.
Okay, let's do it, let's do it.

32:06.049 --> 32:09.969
Here is sort of the progress right here.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.974
So I've got everything
sort of thrown in the middle.

32:15.516 --> 32:18.394
There's six-plus bags of garbage here.

32:21.731 --> 32:24.150
Hey, Mom's just going through some stuff,
okay?

32:24.233 --> 32:25.568
I want boobies.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.112
'Kay, give me a few minutes
and we'll do some boobies, okay?

32:28.196 --> 32:30.073
Wow!

32:30.156 --> 32:31.616
Okay? Is this okay?

32:32.325 --> 32:34.243
<i>"Miscellaneous" is like the entire house.</i>

32:34.744 --> 32:35.995
<i>I'm a little nervous.</i>

32:36.454 --> 32:38.081
<i>I feel like it's gonna take us some time.</i>

32:38.915 --> 32:40.541
And if you can't tell, I'm really tired.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.544
We're tired 'cause we've been staying up
late to do everything.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.172
This is what her kitchen
looks like right now.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.467
There's stuff everywhere. Hey, bud.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.845
I think we're on to these bottom cabinets.
I think the top ones are...

32:53.137 --> 32:54.305
Cleared out.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.475
We've filled up a couple
trash bins. We're on our second one now.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.978
<i>I will say that my anxiety...</i>

33:00.645 --> 33:02.939
<i>hasn't been even high.</i>

33:03.064 --> 33:04.649
I think because...

33:04.732 --> 33:08.695
Sometimes with anxiety, knowing that
something might eventually get done,

33:08.778 --> 33:10.655
even though it's not done yet, is nice,

33:10.738 --> 33:13.199
versus "It's never gonna get done.
I have no idea."

33:13.783 --> 33:15.702
Jaxon, do you like this one? Yes or no.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.620
-Uh, yes!
-Yay!

33:17.704 --> 33:18.621
Good job.

33:18.705 --> 33:19.789
How about this?

33:21.249 --> 33:22.458
-You like it?
-Yes.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.960
Are you sure? You took a second.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.253
-You like this?
- Yeah.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.338
- Okay.
-Do you like this one?

33:27.463 --> 33:28.798
No, do <i>you </i>like this one?

33:28.965 --> 33:31.300
So this is my makeup drawer.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.428
We've kind of already separated a few.

33:33.511 --> 33:36.097
I've set Ryan up over here
to do some makeup.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.348
Can I have a towel, Mom?

33:38.016 --> 33:39.559
- You need a towel?
-Yeah.
Let me see what you did.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.856
Oh, you look so pretty.

33:45.732 --> 33:46.858
As you can see,

33:46.941 --> 33:49.736
we're kind of like
in the middle of everything.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.572
All these bags are all the clothes.

33:53.072 --> 33:55.742
I think there's also one bag of toys.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.952
All this is gonna be gone.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.830
And hopefully this place
is gonna be cleared out

34:00.913 --> 34:02.540
and look a hell of a lot better.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.500
While you are tidying,

34:04.584 --> 34:09.297
it may seem like things are
more cluttered  than before.

34:09.422 --> 34:10.465
But there's no need to worry.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.718
By following the process step by step,

34:13.885 --> 34:16.095
there will always be an end
to tidying.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.570
Marie, yay!

34:32.695 --> 34:34.489
-Good to see you.
-I'm so happy you're here!

34:34.572 --> 34:36.908
-Good to see you, Rachel.
-Nice to see you guys.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.951
Oh, my gosh.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.787
-I was waiting for this day.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.331
Can I tell you, Marie,
like, during this process,

34:43.414 --> 34:45.792
I'm already feeling good, like,
waking up already.

34:45.875 --> 34:48.377
And I'm freaking tired.
I'm tired, but I still feel good.

34:48.836 --> 34:51.089
Even with Kevin and I, like,
things have changed with us.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.759
Like, he has been more romantic
and cute lately.

34:55.218 --> 34:57.845
He says, "Oh, the whole cleaning thing
is, like, sexy."

34:57.929 --> 35:00.306
So it's just, you know-- I'm serious!

35:04.811 --> 35:06.938
That is a very American way
of looking at it.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.565
-I love it. I love it so much.
-It really is.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.485
It really is. So thank you. I'm excited.

35:12.568 --> 35:14.112
I'm so glad to hear that.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.780
Yes, thank you!

35:16.197 --> 35:19.242
So in terms of where things go, I know
you'll help us eventually with that,

35:19.325 --> 35:22.036
but we did the best that we can.
Again, if there's a better place...

35:22.120 --> 35:23.913
This is good.

35:23.996 --> 35:24.831
I did everything.

35:24.914 --> 35:27.208
I was like, okay, I discarded,
now tell me where it goes.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.256
But it's-- It's nearly perfect.

35:33.339 --> 35:34.715
No, I appreciate that.

35:34.799 --> 35:38.094
I feel like I don't know the best way
to store it, so I'm gonna--

35:38.177 --> 35:39.929
You have to give me, like, your tips.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.350
My advice for storage

35:44.433 --> 35:48.020
is try to keep things of the same sizes
together in the same place.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.147
Right, I see that.

35:49.480 --> 35:54.193
Another advice I have for storing
is utilize tiny boxes in here.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.529
It's easier to place back.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.364
Yes, they have a spot.
To have a home for everything.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.619
Hello, hello.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.996
- Hi, babe.
-I'm home.

36:05.079 --> 36:07.123
- Hi! Good to see you!
-Hi, how are you, Marie?

36:07.206 --> 36:08.416
Good to see you.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.002
There's been some good stuff
going on in here.

36:11.085 --> 36:13.087
I'm excited, I wanna hear.
Let me put this down.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.548
-Oh.
-What, what, what? Oh.

36:15.631 --> 36:17.550
-Oh, I'm sorry, you too, you too.
-No, babe, babe.

36:17.633 --> 36:19.844
I'm saying there's been some
good stuff going on in here.

36:24.473 --> 36:29.103
Rachel and Kevin have a
strong grasp of what it means to spark joy

36:29.312 --> 36:30.354
So with that,

36:30.479 --> 36:33.482
we're moving on to the final category,
sentimental items.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.777
<i>Sentimental items have</i>
<i>many categories.</i>

36:37.111 --> 36:40.865
<i>For example, memorabilia,</i>
<i>such as old letters or photos.</i>

36:41.199 --> 36:45.703
Let's take
the sentimental things into the house.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.414
- Okay, babe.
- Okay.

36:49.123 --> 36:53.878
That reminds me, I wanted to
tell you one more thing about storage.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.004
Okay.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.592
-These smaller items...
-I know.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.598
- No, Marie!

37:08.809 --> 37:11.270
Remember how I said
we often store everything

37:11.354 --> 37:13.272
-in a way that we can't see it?
- Yes.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.025
So that you end up buying
the same thing over and over again.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.860
Yeah, I do it all the time, yes.

37:17.985 --> 37:21.155
So, you put it
in there, so that it's easy to see.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.783
So make sure
that when you open anything,

37:23.866 --> 37:28.079
it's readily apparent what you have
and how many you have.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.831
I love that. Thank you.

37:31.832 --> 37:32.792
Hey, babe.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.294
I'm just going through pictures right now.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.088
- Yeah?
- Come here, help me.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.467
-Oh, I forgot about these.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.345
- Oh, wow!
-I know, these are our wedding things.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.432
We have to put them in different frames.

37:48.641 --> 37:53.312
We had such a fun wedding
and, uh, her sisters and my brothers

37:54.105 --> 37:56.357
gave the best speeches at our wedding.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.859
And so they're all, like, here.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.695
We have to set a reminder
to look at frames.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.448
- She loves how you two are.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.285
You guys are reminding us
what we started with.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.161
We get lost in the moment. Yeah.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.247
Babe, you were super hot
on our wedding day.
- What about now, babe?
- What's that ?

38:13.416 --> 38:14.417
And every day since.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.626
Okay, thank you.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.513
- You wanna start with the bins?
- Yeah, I'll pull 'em out.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.307
Who's in that picture?
Who's this?

38:29.390 --> 38:30.224
<i>Mémé.</i>

38:30.308 --> 38:32.351
Yeah, we gotta give
these pictures to <i>Mémé.</i>

38:32.810 --> 38:35.521
-I want the--
- Oh, my God.

38:35.604 --> 38:37.356
Yeah. If you wanna look,
you gotta sit here.

38:37.606 --> 38:40.318
Babe, I don't remember the last time
I looked through these pictures.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.696
We should finally put
some wedding pictures up

38:43.779 --> 38:45.614
so people don't think
that we're just roommates.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.702
-Hey, whatever you want to do, I'm in.
-No, I'm serious.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.580
That way when we get mad at each other
we look up and see our picture

38:52.663 --> 38:55.249
and we're like, "Oh, it's you,
this is why we're doing this."

38:55.541 --> 38:57.126
<i>I love how Kevin and I are.</i>

38:57.418 --> 39:00.546
<i>I've noticed a difference in him,</i>
<i>even just his demeanor.</i>

39:00.921 --> 39:04.216
We haven't been nitpicking on each other
and actually have been enjoying our time.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.135
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah?

39:06.218 --> 39:08.304
I'll never forget your
flavor saver when I met you.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.348
-Oh, man.
-I wanna see that for one sec.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.100
-That's how I got you.
-Babe, but your bleached hair?

39:13.434 --> 39:15.519
<i>It's almost like another bonus</i>
<i>from her method</i>

39:15.603 --> 39:17.938
<i>as opposed to the house just</i>
<i>looking nice and feeling good,</i>

39:18.022 --> 39:19.607
<i>Kevin and I's relationship,</i>

39:19.690 --> 39:21.192
<i>is just in a different place.</i>

39:21.400 --> 39:23.027
<i>And my kids...</i>

39:23.569 --> 39:25.613
<i>maybe because they've been</i>
<i>seeing us do it more often.</i>

39:26.030 --> 39:27.406
<i>We were  folding the other day</i>

39:27.490 --> 39:30.493
and, like, Ryan was doing things
where she was patting the clothes.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.620
<i>Like, she's already noticing these things.</i>

39:32.912 --> 39:34.872
<i>So I feel like the more that we do it,</i>

39:34.955 --> 39:37.208
<i>that habit is going to be put into them.</i>

39:37.291 --> 39:39.085
So I'm just, like, excited. I don't know.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.961
Literally, if you felt my chest right now,

39:41.045 --> 39:43.089
it's like my heart's beating
'cause I'm excited.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.300
I love that we had our date night
the other night.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.136
Even though you were tired
thanks for going out.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.847
It was easy, there wasn't
anything else to do. It was nice.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.307
Times that you, like, do the dishes

39:53.391 --> 39:55.976
and I come home or wake up
and the whole kitchen's clean,

39:56.060 --> 39:58.604
like, I love that feeling,
so, thanks for doing the dishes.

39:58.938 --> 39:59.772
Yep.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.024
Rachel and I are...

40:03.192 --> 40:05.820
It's like it gives me the, uh,
chills a little bit.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.696
It's like we're, like, happier.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.240
We're more at ease.

40:09.740 --> 40:10.574
There's less--

40:11.033 --> 40:12.410
Like, there's less tension.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.786
When we're doing...

40:14.245 --> 40:16.747
things in the kitchen
or we're doing the laundry,

40:16.831 --> 40:20.126
we're talking, we're having a conversation
about our day and et cetera.

40:20.209 --> 40:23.462
And it's-- It's not something
that takes away

40:24.213 --> 40:25.256
from our life anymore.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.216
It's something that adds to our life now.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.259
Hi, Daddy!

40:28.342 --> 40:29.427
Hi, honey.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.637
-Imma give you kisses now!
-Okay!

40:32.805 --> 40:35.015
-I love you, Daddy!

40:35.850 --> 40:37.059
You're so pretty!

40:37.476 --> 40:38.477
You're so pretty!

40:39.019 --> 40:40.604
You're so cute! I love you!

40:40.938 --> 40:42.565
You're so cute. I love you, too.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.236
She's next level, man. I don't know.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.196
We can't figure out
where the hell she came from.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.239
Daddy!

40:55.035 --> 40:56.954
I really want to do this
for my mom and my aunt.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.247
-Oh, my God.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.166
Open and see. Want me to hold you?

41:00.249 --> 41:01.500
-Yeah.
-Okay. Ready?

41:01.584 --> 41:03.586
-Who's here, Dad?
-Okay, let's see.

41:03.961 --> 41:07.173
- Hi!
-Oh, my goodness, who is it?

41:07.715 --> 41:09.592
-How are you? Oh my gosh, come in.
- Good!

41:09.675 --> 41:12.219
-Hi, Marie.
-How are you guys? Come in and sit.

41:12.553 --> 41:15.014
I feel like now you can enjoy
and sit in my home.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.766
Yeah, have a seat.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.393
Please sit here.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.479
Thank you.

41:23.856 --> 41:26.650
The vibe is completely different
from the first day I came.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.611
Oh, my God. We feel it, too.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.906
You said you are doing your own laundry

41:31.989 --> 41:34.617
but how often does your helper come?

41:34.700 --> 41:35.868
I sent her a message.

41:35.951 --> 41:38.204
You know, "We're going through
a process right now and...

41:38.621 --> 41:42.374
we're trying to learn to fold our laundry,
so I don't think I'll be using you."

41:42.458 --> 41:45.628
She said, "I'm so happy that you found
something that works for you.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.172
That's all I could ever--"
She was actually happy for me.

41:48.255 --> 41:50.674
- I'm so happy to hear that

41:51.091 --> 41:53.093
We're excited to show you some stuff, too.

41:55.095 --> 41:56.972
- Yeah, I can't wait!

41:59.934 --> 42:01.727
Wow, it's so different.

42:01.810 --> 42:02.686
Wow.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.444
<i>I've never felt as good</i>
<i>about something</i>

42:10.528 --> 42:12.863
<i>in terms of, like, organizing as I do now.</i>

42:19.453 --> 42:24.166
<i>I can honestly say that I'm really proud</i>
<i>of what we've accomplished with the house</i>

42:24.917 --> 42:26.335
<i>in such a short period of time.</i>

42:30.756 --> 42:32.591
- We're good?

42:32.675 --> 42:34.802
I'm so satisfied. This is fantastic.

42:34.885 --> 42:35.886
Oh, my God, good!

42:37.513 --> 42:40.057
<i>I can't get my day started now</i>
<i>until I make my bed.</i>

42:41.475 --> 42:43.811
- <i>She's been making it every day.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Every day?</i>

42:46.480 --> 42:48.315
<i>I don't let myself get lazy.</i>

42:48.399 --> 42:50.901
<i>I wanna do it because</i>
<i>I wanna keep this feeling going.</i>

42:50.985 --> 42:54.280
<i>So, thank you to you</i>
<i>for inspiring us to do that.</i>

42:57.658 --> 43:00.494
<i>I didn't realize the importance</i>
<i>of everything having a home.</i>

43:05.499 --> 43:07.751
<i>I can see that your lifestyle</i>
<i>itself has changed.</i>

43:07.876 --> 43:09.169
- It's crazy.

43:10.045 --> 43:11.046
<i>How's the folding?</i>

43:11.213 --> 43:14.091
- <i>Great.</i>
-<i> Really? Good, I'm so excited.</i>

43:14.425 --> 43:17.803
I can feel the spirit of this bedroom.

43:17.928 --> 43:18.929
I'm so happy.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.474
<i>Okay, let's show you the kids' room.</i>

43:24.935 --> 43:27.021
<i>Everything you have is so cute.</i>

43:27.104 --> 43:28.647
<i>Ooh! Thank you!</i>

43:31.817 --> 43:32.693
<i>We like this room.</i>

43:32.776 --> 43:34.695
<i>It's been easy to find stuff</i>
<i>for the kids.</i>

43:34.987 --> 43:36.405
- <i>Perfect.</i>
- <i>Perfect?</i>

43:37.156 --> 43:38.365
<i>Amazing!</i>

43:39.950 --> 43:42.244
<i>It's like a whole different closet.</i>

43:42.536 --> 43:45.372
I feel like we have
the kitchen now. Go ahead.

43:47.916 --> 43:49.251
<i>This room looks...</i>

43:50.085 --> 43:51.378
<i>completely different.</i>

43:51.629 --> 43:53.464
<i>I just never felt at ease in here.</i>

43:53.672 --> 43:55.674
<i>And now, like, it feels really good.</i>

43:58.636 --> 43:59.803
Who's that?

43:59.928 --> 44:02.765
<i>It feels so different in here.</i>

44:04.892 --> 44:06.810
<i>Opening the drawers, too,</i>
<i>is so nice.</i>

44:06.894 --> 44:08.062
<i>We know where everything goes.</i>

44:09.188 --> 44:10.564
<i>We experienced doing the house,</i>

44:10.648 --> 44:12.441
<i>but it's just so bright in here</i>
<i>and so clean,</i>

44:12.524 --> 44:13.734
<i>it's like-- </i>

44:14.360 --> 44:16.070
<i>This is complete.</i>

44:16.862 --> 44:19.114
-And finally the garage.
-And the garage?

44:19.615 --> 44:21.909
- Kevin's going to show you.
-Garage, let's do it.

44:22.117 --> 44:23.619
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

44:23.702 --> 44:26.789
<i>Kevin's excited about the garage.</i>
<i>He worked hard on this.</i>

44:28.374 --> 44:30.084
<i>Doesn't it even look different in here?</i>

44:30.334 --> 44:32.961
- It's completely different.

44:33.045 --> 44:34.296
-Trust me.
-Oh, my gosh.

44:35.214 --> 44:37.966
<i>Everything is separated by category.</i>

44:38.050 --> 44:40.678
- <i>This is a dramatic change.</i>
-<i> Good, thank you.</i>

44:42.346 --> 44:45.557
<i>I like the feeling in this space.</i>

44:45.641 --> 44:46.850
<i>I do, too.</i>

44:47.601 --> 44:50.562
Both you, Rachel and Kevin,

44:50.646 --> 44:54.274
<i>you worked on your entire house this time.</i>

44:54.358 --> 44:56.235
<i>You had quite the experience.</i>

44:56.402 --> 44:57.945
Thank you. It was a lot of work,

44:58.028 --> 45:00.447
but it was motivating
knowing what the end was gonna be.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.491
- And you finished.

45:02.574 --> 45:04.034
Yeah, which is crazy.

45:04.159 --> 45:06.245
-With two young kids, it's crazy.
-Yeah.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.664
I'm so happy.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.041
I like you the most!

45:11.125 --> 45:13.001
- I'm so happy!

45:14.795 --> 45:17.131
<i>Marie, she changed my life.</i>

45:17.214 --> 45:19.842
<i>It's just insane how, like,</i>
<i>my mentality has changed.</i>

45:20.217 --> 45:22.386
There's a sense of, like,
relaxation and...

45:22.469 --> 45:24.513
just doing all the things we need to do.

45:24.596 --> 45:27.558
<i>If it's laundry, okay, we do it.</i>
<i>If there's dishes, we just do it.</i>

45:27.975 --> 45:29.184
Show me how you fold it.

45:29.518 --> 45:30.519
I folded!

45:30.728 --> 45:33.272
Even if things do pile up,
it's like, "Nope, we got this."

45:33.355 --> 45:35.858
There's no...
"Oh, my gosh, I'm never gonna get to it."

45:35.941 --> 45:38.360
The sense of calm,
like, "I could totally do this."

45:40.446 --> 45:43.699
<i>There is more time to just</i>
<i>hang with the kids,</i>

45:43.782 --> 45:45.909
<i>especially for me,</i>
<i>when I come home from work.</i>

45:46.326 --> 45:48.203
Is this okay that daddy kisses me?

45:48.287 --> 45:50.956
Daddy, do the big one kiss.

45:51.039 --> 45:52.750
Oh, do the big one kiss? Okay.

45:52.916 --> 45:55.210
We're really happy
and we're just looking forward

45:55.294 --> 45:57.963
to living this way for... for the rest
of our lives, hopefully.

45:58.046 --> 46:00.215
-Yeah.
-It's, It's great, it's been amazing.

46:00.924 --> 46:02.926
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

46:03.010 --> 46:06.889
But I'm actually sad you're going,
but I'm happy because of your method.

46:06.972 --> 46:09.057
We actually get to, like, enjoy the home.

46:09.391 --> 46:11.393
Thank you for showing us
that, like, we could do it,

46:11.477 --> 46:13.353
and that we just needed
a little bit of help.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.273
I feel your happiness
and it makes me happy.

46:16.356 --> 46:17.441
Thank you.

46:17.524 --> 46:19.735
Thank you for what
you've brought to our home, really.

46:21.653 --> 46:24.281
Through this process
of tidying with Rachel and Kevin,

46:24.364 --> 46:25.908
I reaffirmed my feelings,

46:26.158 --> 46:31.121
that indeed, couples can deepen their ties
through tidying.

46:31.413 --> 46:36.043
I hope that each day for the Friend family
will continue to spark joy.
