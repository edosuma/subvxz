CORY.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.734
WE HAVE BEEN HERE
FOR A FULL MINUTE

00:34.734 --> 00:36.133
AND YOU HAVE NOT
ONCE MENTIONED...

00:36.133 --> 00:38.934
I'LL NEVER FORGET
THE FIRST TIME
I SAW HER, SHAWN.

00:38.934 --> 00:41.000
OH, HERE WE GO.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.967
I WAS OVER THERE
ON THE MONKEY BARS...

00:42.967 --> 00:45.734
CRYING, BECAUSE
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO GET DOWN.

00:45.734 --> 00:49.000
BUT SHE GAVE ME
THE COURAGE TO JUMP!

00:49.000 --> 00:51.967
I MEAN, I TORE SOME
CARTILAGE, SURE,

00:51.967 --> 00:58.500
BUT I KNEW, SHAWN,
THAT I HAD FOUND MY
PLAYGROUND MATE FOR LIFE.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.400
TOPANGA!

01:02.400 --> 01:04.000
MOMMY!

01:05.033 --> 01:06.700
JUST STOP IT!
STOP IT, CORY,

01:06.700 --> 01:07.934
YOU'RE BEING
RIDICULOUS.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.700
YOU KNOW WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO GO TO THE MUSEUM TODAY?

01:09.700 --> 01:10.800
OH, GOD.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
TOPANGA WAS REAL EXCITED

01:11.800 --> 01:12.934
ABOUT THIS NEW
VAN GOGH EXHIBIT

01:12.934 --> 01:14.300
THAT WAS COMING TO TOWN.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.767
SHE WENT WITHOUT ME,
DIDN'T SHE?

01:15.767 --> 01:18.033
NO, NO, YOU'RE THERE
WITH HER RIGHT NOW.

01:18.033 --> 01:19.900
WHY DON'T YOU TELL
ME THE MONKEY BARS
STORY AGAIN?

01:19.900 --> 01:23.600
'CAUSE I WANNA SEE
IF MY HEAD WILL
ACTUALLY EXPLODE!

01:23.600 --> 01:24.834
OH, I'M A CLOWN
TO YOU, HUH?

01:24.834 --> 01:26.233
AM I HERE TO AMUSE YOU?

01:26.233 --> 01:27.233
ANGELA WENT WITH HER.

01:27.233 --> 01:28.934
WELL, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GO WITH HER.

01:28.934 --> 01:30.467
DID YOU KNOW
THAT I CAMPED OUT

01:30.467 --> 01:33.734
OVERNIGHT AT
THE PHILADELPHIA
MUSEUM OF ART

01:33.734 --> 01:35.300
TO BEAT THE MAD RUSH
FOR TICKETS?

01:35.300 --> 01:37.867
AND IN THE MORNING,
I WAS THE FIRST GUY
ON LINE.

01:37.867 --> 01:40.834
CORY, YOU WERE
THE ONLY GUY ON LINE.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.033
THIS CITY IS
A CULTURAL VACUUM,
MY FRIEND.

01:45.033 --> 01:46.767
THAT'S WHY MY PEOPLE
SETTLED HERE.

01:52.834 --> 01:58.000
Topanga: "SILAS MATTHEWS
AND EBENEZER HUNTER,
FOUNDING FATHERS."

01:59.934 --> 02:01.734
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME HERE.

02:01.734 --> 02:03.600
I WAS SUPPOSED TO
COME HERE WITH CORY.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.500
EVERYTHING
REMINDS ME OF HIM.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.900
ANGELA, I MISS HIM.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.000
TOPANGA, YOU'VE
BEEN WAITING

02:13.000 --> 02:14.400
FOREVER TO SEE
THIS EXHIBIT.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.734
HOW COULD HE TALK TO
ANOTHER GIRL ALL NIGHT?

02:16.734 --> 02:17.967
HOW COULD HE KISS HER?

02:17.967 --> 02:19.767
HE TOLD YOU IT
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.500
HOW COULD IT
NOT MEAN ANYTHING?

02:21.500 --> 02:22.900
HE KISSED ANOTHER GIRL.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.800
YOU DON'T KISS SOMEBODY
AND HAVE IT
NOT MEAN ANYTHING.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.033
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:27.033 --> 02:28.967
SHOULD HAVE LEFT HIM
UP ON THOSE MONKEY BARS.

02:28.967 --> 02:32.600
OH, PLEASE, NOT THE
MONKEY BARS STORY.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.800
MONKEY BARS.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.734
I WAS IN THE SANDBOX
AND I SAW
THE CUTEST LITTLE

02:37.734 --> 02:40.400
CURLY-HAIRED BOY
ON THE MONKEY--

02:40.400 --> 02:42.800
OK, JUST FORGET IT.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.867
"VAN GOGH'S BRUSH STROKES
AND CHOICE OF COLOR

02:44.867 --> 02:48.367
EMPHASIZE HIS HEIGHTENED
SENSE OF EMOTION."

02:48.367 --> 02:49.767
YEAH.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.300
OOH!

02:55.033 --> 02:57.300
MMM, IF YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT EMOTION,

02:57.300 --> 02:59.500
CHECK OUT THE MOTION
COMING THIS WAY.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.934
OOH, LORD,
I FORGET MY NAME.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.700
HI, I'M NANCY
OR SOMETHING.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.133
EXCUSE ME,
IS YOUR NAME TOPANGA?

03:09.133 --> 03:11.200
ANGELA.
MY NAME IS ANGELA.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.133
BUT I ALREADY
HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.300
OH, HER.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.567
YES, MY NAME
IS TOPANGA.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.133
WELL, I'M RICKY FERRIS.

03:21.133 --> 03:22.400
I'M--I'M SURE YOU
DON'T REMEMBER ME,

03:22.400 --> 03:24.600
BUT I CERTAINLY
REMEMBER YOU.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.934
OH, YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER.

03:26.934 --> 03:29.233
SORT OF. YOU CHANGED
MY LIFE FOREVER

03:29.233 --> 03:30.900
WHEN WE WERE
ABOUT 6 YEARS OLD.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.100
I DID?

03:32.100 --> 03:33.500
SHE DID?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.233
YOU ENDED MY
LITTLE LEAGUE CAREER.

03:35.233 --> 03:38.000
HIT ME WITH A FAST BALL
SO HARD RIGHT
ON MY LEFT CHEEK.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.100
I THINK I STILL HAVE
A MARK THERE,

03:39.100 --> 03:40.500
BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THAT.

03:41.567 --> 03:42.867
I DO.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.934
YOU SEE, YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO
HELPED ME REALIZE

03:46.934 --> 03:48.567
I WAS MORE OF AN ARTIST
THAN AN ATHLETE.

03:48.567 --> 03:51.233
OH, HE OWES YOU.
MAKE HIM PAY.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.700
I'M SORRY AND I
PROMISE NEVER TO HIT
YOU ON THE TUSH

03:55.700 --> 03:56.867
WITH A FAST BALL
EVER AGAIN.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.033
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE IT UP TO ME

03:58.033 --> 03:59.900
BY SEEING THE VAN GOGH
EXHIBIT TOGETHER?

04:01.867 --> 04:04.100
OH, I THINK I SHOULD
GO CHECK OUT THAT
PAINTING OVER THERE.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.400
ENTITLED, "GO WITH
HIM, HE'S CUTE."

04:10.900 --> 04:14.834
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S HERE
UNDER THIS ROOF.

04:14.834 --> 04:17.667
THE MOST IMPORTANT
PAINTING AND THE GREATEST
LEGACY OF PAINTINGS

04:17.667 --> 04:19.400
EVER TO ENRICH THE WORLD.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.567
<i>IRISES? </i>

04:20.567 --> 04:22.100
WELL, NO, ACTUALLY,
THIS IS MY SECOND FAVORITE.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.667
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
<i>STARRY NIGHT.  </i>
YOU KNOW IT?

04:24.667 --> 04:26.500
I SAW IT
IN A BOOK ONCE,
BUT I DON'T THINK

04:26.500 --> 04:28.000
THE BOOK DID
IT JUSTICE.
NO, IT DIDN'T.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.233
SEE, WHAT YOU NEED
IS SOMEBODY WHO'S
PASSIONATE ABOUT IT

04:30.233 --> 04:32.600
TO MAKE YOU PASSIONATE
ABOUT IT, TOO.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.233
YOU KNOW ANYONE
LIKE THAT?

04:34.233 --> 04:37.000
YEAH, I DO.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.300
I THINK THIS
IS THE MOST

04:45.300 --> 04:47.200
SPIRITUAL PIECE
EVER PAINTED.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.867
LOOK AT THE WAY
HE PAINTED THE STARS.

04:48.867 --> 04:51.200
SEE HOW THEY PROTECT
THE SMALL TOWN?

04:51.200 --> 04:52.200
IT'S LIKE THESE

04:52.200 --> 04:53.967
SWIRLING DIVINE
LIGHTS FROM GOD

04:53.967 --> 04:56.200
THAT SAY I WILL
ALWAYS PROTECT YOU.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.133
WELL, IT SAYS HERE
THAT VAN GOGH
FOUND RELIGION

04:58.133 --> 04:59.567
AROUND THE TIME
HE PAINTED THIS.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.967
YEAH, HE FOUND
HIS SOUL,

05:00.967 --> 05:02.400
AND HE PUT IT ON
THIS CANVAS.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.033
THAT'S--THAT'S
WHAT'S MOVING YOU.

05:04.033 --> 05:07.934
SOMEONE IS ABLE TO
LET YOU SEE RIGHT
INTO HIS SOUL.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.033
I'M SORRY. I GUESS
I COULD TALK ABOUT
THIS PAINTING ALL DAY.

05:13.033 --> 05:16.367
YOU DID. THE
MUSEUM WILL BE
CLOSING SHORTLY.

05:16.367 --> 05:19.367
OH, MY GOSH,
WE TALKED ALL DAY.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.500
NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.800
WHAT?

05:21.800 --> 05:23.400
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING FOR DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.233
SO, DINNER?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.233
WE CAN KEEP TALKING
ABOUT <i>STARRY NIGHT </i>

05:35.233 --> 05:36.967
OR THE REAL STARS
IF YOU WANT.

05:36.967 --> 05:40.700
RICKY, LOOK, I'VE HAD
A REALLY GREAT TIME
TALKING TO YOU.

05:40.700 --> 05:43.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE TALKED ALL DAY,
BUT I DON'T KNOW,

05:43.300 --> 05:45.200
MY HEADS IN A FUNNY
PLACE RIGHT NOW.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.567
TOPANGA, DO YOU PLAN
ON EATING DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT?

05:47.567 --> 05:48.800
YES.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.500
SO DO I,
SO HOW'S THIS?

05:50.500 --> 05:51.667
TOMORROW NIGHT,
AT 8:00,

05:51.667 --> 05:53.600
WE'LL MEET
AT THIBAULT
DE CHATTELU'S.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.200
THAT LITTLE FRENCH CAFE?

05:55.200 --> 05:56.400
RIGHT. NOW
HERE'S THE THING.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.000
WE'RE GOING
TO BE SITTING
AT THE SAME TABLE.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.300
AND I'M GOING
TO BE SITTING
ACROSS FROM YOU.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.500
NOW, IF YOU WANT IT
TO BE A DATE,

06:01.500 --> 06:03.000
YOU LOOK UP
FROM YOUR DINNER.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.367
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT
TO BE A DATE,

06:04.367 --> 06:05.700
DON'T LOOK UP.

06:05.700 --> 06:09.400
BUT IF YOU DO
LOOK UP, I'LL BE
LOOKING BACK AT YOU.

06:16.934 --> 06:19.300
ALL RIGHT, COME OUT.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.300
YOU KNOW I COULDN'T
HELP OVERHEARING.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.667
SHOULD I GO OUT
WITH HIM OR NOT?

06:23.667 --> 06:28.100
WELL, HE'S GORGEOUS,
CULTURED, SENSITIVE
ARTIST TYPE,

06:28.100 --> 06:31.367
WANTS TO TAKE YOU TO
A ROMANTIC FRENCH RESTAURANT.

06:31.367 --> 06:33.133
SHOULD YOU
GO OUT WITH HIM?

06:33.133 --> 06:34.934
HMM, LET ME THINK.

06:34.934 --> 06:35.934
YES!

06:35.934 --> 06:37.600
I DON'T KNOW.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.567
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT?
HE IS EVERYTHING
YOU COULD WANT.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.000
HE'S NOT CORY.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.967
NO, HE'S NOT CORY.

06:43.967 --> 06:45.467
SO IF I
GO OUT WITH HIM,

06:45.467 --> 06:47.767
THEN CORY AND I
ARE REALLY, REALLY
FINISHED, AREN'T WE?

06:47.767 --> 06:52.133
I DON'T SEE WHERE
IT WOULD HELP
THE RELATIONSHIP, NO.

06:52.133 --> 06:54.033
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

06:54.033 --> 06:56.300
I MEAN, RICKY AND I
TALKED ALL DAY.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.734
HE KNEW SO MUCH
ABOUT THE PAINTINGS.

06:57.734 --> 07:00.133
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME
WANT TO GET
TO KNOW HIM BETTER.

07:00.133 --> 07:02.567
HE'S SO COMPLEX
AND INTERESTING.

07:02.567 --> 07:05.734
WELL, DO YOU THINK
CORY IS COMPLEX
AND INTERESTING?

07:05.734 --> 07:09.100
YEAH, BUT
IT'S DIFFERENT.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.200
EVEN THOUGH I'VE KNOWN
CORY ALL MY LIFE,

07:11.200 --> 07:12.400
HOW CAN I GO OUT
WITH ANOTHER GUY

07:12.400 --> 07:15.133
UNTIL I KNOW WHAT
CORY FEELS ABOUT
THIS PAINTING?

07:15.133 --> 07:19.133
TOPANGA, THIS GUY
SWEPT YOU OFF YOUR FEET.

07:19.133 --> 07:21.467
YOU GOTTA GIVE HIM
A CHANCE.

07:21.467 --> 07:22.900
MAYBE ONE DAY YOU
WON'T BE TELLING PEOPLE

07:22.900 --> 07:25.367
THAT YOU MET THE GUY
YOU LOVE ON THE MONKEY BARS,

07:25.367 --> 07:27.934
BUT YOU MET HIM
IN FRONT OF A MASTERPIECE

07:27.934 --> 07:29.934
AND HE TOLD YOU
HOW HE FELT ABOUT IT,

07:29.934 --> 07:32.900
AND HE SWEPT YOU
OFF YOUR FEET.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.934
I'M NOT LEAVING
MY FEET FOR ANYBODY

07:35.934 --> 07:38.567
UNTIL I GIVE
CORY A CHANCE.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.867
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

08:00.066 --> 08:02.367
TOPANGA, WHY'D
YOU BRING ME HERE?

08:02.367 --> 08:04.834
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU
FEEL ABOUT THIS PAINTING.

08:07.100 --> 08:10.033
WELL, I DON'T GET
WHAT THAT HAS TO DO
WITH ANYTHING.

08:10.033 --> 08:11.800
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
HERE YESTERDAY?

08:11.800 --> 08:14.033
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY.

08:14.033 --> 08:15.900
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME
RIGHT NOW.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.200
YOU AND I WERE SUPPOSED
TO COME HERE TOGETHER

08:17.200 --> 08:19.133
AND I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED IF WE DID.

08:19.133 --> 08:20.567
OH, SO THIS IS
SOME KIND OF TEST.

08:20.567 --> 08:24.300
RIGHT, BIG TEST.
TEST, THE BIGGEST.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.567
WELL, FORGET IT,
TOPANGA.

08:26.567 --> 08:27.700
I'M NOT TAKING
A TEST.

08:27.700 --> 08:31.000
LISTEN, YOU
DON'T REDUCE
OUR RELATIONSHIP

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
TO WHAT YOU
THINK ABOUT ME

08:32.000 --> 08:34.567
BECAUSE OF WHAT I
SEE IN A PAINTING.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.233
THAT'S
NOT IMPORTANT.

08:36.233 --> 08:38.300
WHAT MATTERS IS
WHAT I SEE IN YOU

08:38.300 --> 08:40.300
AND WHAT YOU
SEE IN ME.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.600
WHAT I SEE IN YOU?

08:42.600 --> 08:45.700
<i>PORTRAIT OF SOMEBODY </i>
<i>I THOUGHT I KNEW. </i>

08:45.700 --> 08:48.233
HOW WERE YOU ABLE
TO SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT
TALKING TO SOME GIRL,

08:48.233 --> 08:51.667
THEN KISS HER THE NEXT DAY
AND STILL THINK
YOU CARE ABOUT ME?

08:51.667 --> 08:53.767
BECAUSE I DID
AND I DO.

08:53.767 --> 08:57.400
YOU DON'T OR YOU
WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO DO THOSE THINGS, CORY.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.133
THOSE THINGS DON'T JUST
HAPPEN FOR NO REASON.

08:59.133 --> 09:00.300
LISTEN...

09:00.300 --> 09:02.400
DON'T TELL ME HOW
I FEEL ABOUT YOU, OK?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.467
I KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU.

09:04.467 --> 09:05.734
AND SHE KISSED ME.

09:05.734 --> 09:08.900
OH, AND YOU MOVED AWAY?
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO STOP HER?

09:08.900 --> 09:11.033
NOTHING! NOTHING!

09:11.033 --> 09:13.300
I SAID, "KISS ME,
BABY SWEETIE.

09:13.300 --> 09:16.033
"KILL THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE PERSON I CARE
ABOUT MORE THAN ANYTHING

09:16.033 --> 09:19.367
AND MAKE ME MISERABLE
FOR THE REST
OF MY HORRIBLE LIFE."

09:19.367 --> 09:20.800
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.300
HER KISS MEANT
NOTHING TO ME.

09:22.300 --> 09:27.100
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.
THOSE KIND OF THINGS
DO NOT HAPPEN FOR NO REASON.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.700
THEY HAPPEN
TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING.

09:28.700 --> 09:35.233
AND I KNOW NOW THAT I WILL
NEVER, EVER LOVE ANYBODY
MORE THAN I LOVE YOU.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.233
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN
THE PAINTING, CORY?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.600
I SEE AN ATTACK.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.700
AN ATTACK.

09:54.700 --> 09:58.100
AN ATTACK FROM
ANOTHER WORLD.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.800
AN ATTACK
FROM ANOTHER WORLD.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.200
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S LOOK AGAIN.

10:02.200 --> 10:06.200
WHAT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN GOD AND MAN?

10:07.867 --> 10:09.500
OH, OK, I WAS
ABOUT TO GET THERE.

10:09.500 --> 10:13.000
UM, SEE, GOD,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.100
UNHAPPY
WITH HOW SOME
PARTICULAR HUMANS

10:16.100 --> 10:20.500
TREAT OTHER
PARTICULAR HUMANS
WHO LOVE THEM

10:20.500 --> 10:23.867
HAS DECIDED IT'S
THE END OF WORLD.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.934
AND I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

10:29.200 --> 10:33.233
GOD IS PROTECTING
THE PEOPLE IN THIS
LITTLE TOWN.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.100
THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES
AND THEY COME OUT
OF THEIR HOUSES

10:36.100 --> 10:38.500
AND THEY SEE THIS SKY.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.934
AND THEY KNOW GOD'S
PROTECTION AND LOVE.

10:41.934 --> 10:44.300
AND THAT EVERYTHING
WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

10:44.300 --> 10:48.000
LISTEN, HOW DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO SEE
GOOD IN ANYTHING,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.734
WHEN I FEEL SO BAD
IN HERE?

10:49.734 --> 10:51.667
THIS IS JUST A PAINTING.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.000
THIS IS A
MASTERPIECE.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.700
WE'RE A MASTERPIECE.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.734
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK
RIGHT NOW.

10:57.734 --> 10:59.600
WE'RE GOING TO BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.967
AND I KNOW THAT.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.100
BUT YOU STILL NEED
TO FIND THAT OUT.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.567
YOU KNOW
WHERE I'LL BE.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.934
SO, ANYWAY,
I BOUGHT THIS BERET

11:24.934 --> 11:26.200
AND I GREW SOME HAIR
ON MY CHIN HERE

11:26.200 --> 11:28.767
AND THEN I TOLD
MY PARENTS I WANTED
TO PUT OFF COLLEGE

11:28.767 --> 11:30.600
AND GO TO PARIS AND
PAINT FOR A YEAR.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.500
HOW CRAZY DID THEY GO?

11:32.500 --> 11:34.600
NO, THEY THOUGHT
IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA

11:34.600 --> 11:35.734
AND EXPAND MY
INDIVIDUALITY,

11:35.734 --> 11:36.734
BUT I WAS JUST
TESTING THEM.

11:36.734 --> 11:38.100
NOW I REALLY
HAVE TO GO.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.700
I THOUGHT I HAD
THE ONLY PARENTS
LIKE THAT IN THE WORLD.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.233
SEE, MY MOM GOT THIS JOB
IN PITTSBURGH

11:43.233 --> 11:46.467
AND WE WERE ALL SET TO MOVE
AND AT THE LAST MINUTE,

11:46.467 --> 11:48.033
I TOLD THEM I WASN'T
GOING WITH THEM.

11:48.033 --> 11:50.500
AND THEY LET ME STAY HERE
AND LIVE WITH MY AUNT.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.367
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT
THAT YOU WANTED
TO STAY HERE?

11:53.367 --> 11:56.767
OH, THERE WAS THIS BOY.

11:56.767 --> 11:59.400
OH, SO YOU'VE
BEEN IN LOVE.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.400
YEAH. YEAH, I HAVE.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.934
BUT I'VE NEVER
BEEN TO PARIS.

12:02.934 --> 12:04.867
WELL, MAYBE NOW
YOU'LL HAVE AN EXCUSE.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.133
I HARDLY KNOW YOU.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.834
WE'VE KNOWN EACH
OTHER FOR A WHOLE
DAY AND DINNER

12:07.834 --> 12:09.934
AND WE'RE ALMOST
DONE WITH DESSERT.

12:09.934 --> 12:12.100
CAN I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE DRAWING?

12:12.100 --> 12:14.133
OH, YEAH.

12:21.133 --> 12:22.133
OH, WOW.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.600
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

12:23.600 --> 12:28.300
IT'S NO VAN GOGH,
BUT YOU SAID YOU
LIKED IRISES, SO.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.133
YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD
A REALLY ROUGH DAY.

12:32.133 --> 12:33.967
YOU'RE MAKING IT
LESS ROUGH.

12:33.967 --> 12:36.400
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU EVER SINCE
THE MUSEUM.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.900
IT'S AMAZING WHEN IT
CAN BE A DAY LIKE
ANY OTHER DAY

12:39.900 --> 12:41.000
AND WITHOUT EVEN
EXPECTING IT,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.233
YOU MEET SOMEBODY
INTERESTING,
INSPIRING,

12:44.233 --> 12:46.033
AND TALK FOR HOURS.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.300
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

12:47.300 --> 12:50.033
THOSE THINGS
DON'T JUST HAPPEN
FOR NO REASON.

12:50.033 --> 12:55.033
YOU'RE RIGHT. THEY HAPPEN
TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.200
YEAH.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.734
YOU'RE GOING TO KISS ME
NOW, AREN'T YOU?

13:12.867 --> 13:15.500
HOW COULD YOU
LET HER GO OUT
WITH ANOTHER GUY?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.500
LET HER?
I TOLD HER TO.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.900
OK, ALL RIGHT,
TIME OUT.
TIME OUT, ANGELA.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.600
YOU AND I, WE'RE DOING
PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?

13:23.600 --> 13:24.734
YEAH.

13:24.734 --> 13:26.233
RIGHT, SO THEN WE SHOULD
START TO SHOW EACH OTHER

13:26.233 --> 13:29.500
ALL THE DIFFERENT SIDES
OF OUR PERSONALITIES, RIGHT?

13:29.500 --> 13:30.767
MM-HMM.

13:30.767 --> 13:34.900
OK, OK, GOOD,
SO THEN THIS IS ME
REALLY, REALLY MAD.

13:34.900 --> 13:38.567
YOU TOLD HER TO!
TO GO OUT WITH ANOTHER GUY.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.033
HOW DOES THAT HELP THEM
GET BACK TOGETHER?

13:40.033 --> 13:43.100
NOW, GRANTED,
I MAY NOT BE THE
SMARTEST KID IN SCHOOL,

13:43.100 --> 13:45.934
BUT I THINK IT'S BAD!

13:45.934 --> 13:50.600
ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS ME REALLY,
REALLY PRACTICAL.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.834
CORY AND TOPANGA
HAVE BROKEN UP.

13:52.834 --> 13:54.800
THEY BOTH NEED
TO GET ON
WITH THEIR LIVES.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.700
THEY'RE NOT
BROKEN UP!
THEY'RE BROKEN UP.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.033
THEY'RE
TAKING A BREAK.

13:58.033 --> 13:59.300
THEY'RE BROKEN UP.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.467
THEY'RE...
BROKEN UP.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.500
HEY, HE WENT OUT
WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.567
SHE WENT OUT
WITH ANOTHER GUY.

14:03.567 --> 14:06.100
OK, IF I WENT OUT WITH
ANOTHER GIRL TONIGHT,

14:06.100 --> 14:07.734
THAT WOULDN'T MEAN
THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU

14:07.734 --> 14:09.767
AND WE WOULDN'T BE
BROKEN UP TOMORROW.

14:09.767 --> 14:12.300
OH, YEAH, WELL,
YOU GO OUT WITH
ANOTHER GIRL TONIGHT

14:12.300 --> 14:14.100
AND YOU'LL BE PLENTY
BROKEN TOMORROW

14:14.100 --> 14:16.467
BECAUSE I WILL
BREAK YOU.

14:18.033 --> 14:20.767
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR 15 YEARS, ANGELA.

14:20.767 --> 14:23.300
THESE--THESE LOVE RULES
DON'T APPLY TO THEM.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.467
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT THEY'RE STUCK.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.133
THEY NEED TO SEE WHERE
LIFE TAKES THEM.

14:28.133 --> 14:31.867
OTHERWISE, THEY'RE GOING
TO BE UNHAPPY EVERY DAY.

14:31.867 --> 14:33.567
I DON'T WANT THAT
FOR MY FRIEND.

14:33.567 --> 14:37.467
I DON'T WANT THAT
FOR MY FRIEND, EITHER.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.200
ANGELA, I HAVE
TO TALK TO YOU.
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.200
GOOD OR BAD?

14:48.200 --> 14:49.600
AMAZING. ABSOLUTELY
WONDERFUL.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.967
I'VE NEVER HAD A
KISS THAT MEANT MORE
TO ME IN MY LIFE.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.467
OOH.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.233
I'M SORRY, SHAWN,
IT'S OVER.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.000
COR, WE GOTTA TALK.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.600
GOOD AFTERNOON.

15:09.600 --> 15:14.367
I HOPE EVERYONE ENJOYED
READING THEIR LAST
SHAKESPEARE PLAY

15:14.367 --> 15:15.467
WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.033
OH, HEY, I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU FELT
THAT WAY ABOUT IT.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.233
OK, WE'LL DO ONE MORE.

15:23.233 --> 15:24.367
All: AW!

15:24.367 --> 15:26.734
PSYCH!

15:27.867 --> 15:30.200
MR. HUNTER, PERHAPS
YOU'LL SHARE WITH US

15:30.200 --> 15:33.567
A PASSAGE FROM
<i>ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA. </i>

15:33.567 --> 15:37.000
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT
WAS MEANINGFUL FOR YOU.

15:38.233 --> 15:40.934
UM, THOUGH IT BE HONEST,

15:40.934 --> 15:43.734
IT IS NEVER GOOD
TO BRING BAD NEWS.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.834
ACT 2, SCENE 5.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.033
Feeny: INTERESTING
PASSAGE.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.600
WHY DID YOU
CHOOSE THAT?

15:48.600 --> 15:52.867
WELL, BECAUSE I WANT
EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS...

15:52.867 --> 15:54.500
NOT TO KILL THE MESSENGER.

15:57.934 --> 16:00.133
OK, MESSENGER, DELIVER.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.367
COR, WHAT I'M
ABOUT TO TELL YOU

16:01.367 --> 16:03.667
IS GOING TO MAKE YOU
WANT TO KILL ME.

16:03.667 --> 16:04.867
I'M NOT GOING
TO KILL YOU, SHAWN.

16:04.867 --> 16:07.600
IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME
TO BREAK IN A NEW BEST FRIEND.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.500
TOPANGA WENT OUT
WITH ANOTHER GUY
LAST NIGHT.

16:12.567 --> 16:13.734
I'M SORRY.

16:13.734 --> 16:16.133
YOU KNOW WE'RE
THE ONLY 2 GUYS
IN THE WORLD

16:16.133 --> 16:18.567
WHO STILL THINK THERE'S
HOPE FOR ME AND TOPANGA.

16:18.567 --> 16:20.033
YOU'RE THROWING IN
THE TOWEL?

16:20.033 --> 16:22.700
YEAH, I AM.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.000
OK.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.467
THANK YOU.

16:27.734 --> 16:28.867
YOU OK?

16:28.867 --> 16:29.934
YEAH, SURE.

16:29.934 --> 16:33.233
IT'S AN INTERESTING
FEELING THOUGH.

16:33.233 --> 16:35.000
WHAT, TO KNOW
IT'S OVER?

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
TO BE THE ONLY GUY
IN THE WORLD
WHO KNOWS IT'S NOT.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.667
SO YOU LIKE
THIS GUY, HUH?

16:47.667 --> 16:49.300
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.500
I KNEW IT THE MINUTE
I KISSED HIM.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.734
TOPANGA, YOU'RE COMING
OFF A LONG RELATIONSHIP

16:53.734 --> 16:55.133
AND YOU'RE
VULNERABLE RIGHT NOW.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.934
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
RUSH INTO SOMETHING
BECAUSE OF ONE KISS

16:57.934 --> 17:00.967
FROM SOME GORGEOUS,
PERFECT GUY.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.967
IT WAS JUST A KISS,
WASN'T IT?

17:02.967 --> 17:04.400
THAT'S ALL IT TOOK.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.600
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I FELT
WHEN HE KISSED ME?

17:06.600 --> 17:08.767
YEAH, I PROBABLY DO.

17:08.767 --> 17:10.300
NOTHING.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.467
WHAT?

17:12.467 --> 17:13.900
I CALLED HIM TODAY
TO LET HIM KNOW

17:13.900 --> 17:16.033
I CAN'T EVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

17:16.033 --> 17:17.100
YOU DID?

17:17.100 --> 17:20.700
BECAUSE I'M IN LOVE,
ANGELA.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.200
I DON'T MEAN HIGH
SCHOOL I LOVE YOU,
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

17:23.200 --> 17:27.567
I MEAN, I AM IN LOVE
WITH CORY MATTHEWS.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.200
AND I WANT TO BE.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.767
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE
IN THE WORLD FOR ME,

17:30.767 --> 17:32.300
AND THERE
NEVER WILL BE.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.300
I'M TAKEN.

17:49.033 --> 17:51.500
WHATCHA DOING
UP THERE?

17:52.934 --> 17:54.200
WELL, I WAS HOPING
I COULD SIT UP HERE

17:54.200 --> 17:55.667
AND A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
WOULD HELP ME DOWN

17:55.667 --> 18:00.600
AND WE'D FALL IN LOVE
FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.000
IT WORKED ONCE.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
I MET THIS GUY.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.400
I WENT BACK TO
LOOK AT THAT PAINTING.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
WE TALKED ALL DAY.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.767
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT
YOU SAW IN IT.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.500
WE WENT ON A DATE AND
HE DREW ME A PICTURE
OF SOME FLOWERS.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.767
AND I SPENT
A HALF AN HOUR
LOOKING AT IT.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.867
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.700
HE KISSED ME.
BUT I COULDN'T
GET IT.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.500
NOT BY MYSELF.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.700
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
WHAT YOU SAID.

18:28.700 --> 18:32.100
THAT GOD PROTECTS PEOPLE
IN THEIR LITTLE HOMES.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.500
THAT THEY LIVE
THEIR LIVES,

18:33.500 --> 18:35.467
AND THEY COME OUTSIDE
AND THEY LOOK UP
AT THE SKY

18:35.467 --> 18:37.734
AND THEY KNOW GOD'S
PROTECTION AND LOVE.

18:37.734 --> 18:40.667
AND THAT EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OK.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.100
BUT I'M NOT LIKE YOU,
TOPANGA,

18:42.100 --> 18:46.000
THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND
THOSE KIND OF THINGS
SO FAST.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.300
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.867
AND I'M NOT LIKE YOU
THAT I UNDERSTAND

18:48.867 --> 18:51.767
THAT YOU CAN KISS
SOMEBODY AND HAVE IT
NOT MEAN ANYTHING.

18:51.767 --> 18:53.800
THAT YOU CAN CARE
ABOUT SOMEBODY
SO DEEPLY

18:53.800 --> 18:55.200
THAT NOTHING
CAN CHANGE THAT.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.400
NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES YOU
TRIED TO TELL ME.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.600
BUT I UNDERSTAND
NOW.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.400
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
PAINTING.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.133
IT'S JUST A PAINTING.

19:04.133 --> 19:08.500
WE'RE REAL AND YOU
ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT.

19:10.767 --> 19:15.100
I LOVE YOU AND WILL
ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

19:16.767 --> 19:19.600
ANOTHER GUY KISSED YOU?

19:19.600 --> 19:23.300
YEAH. YOU WANNA DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

19:32.967 --> 19:35.300
I FELT THAT, BOY.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.233
SO WE STARTING OVER?

19:39.300 --> 19:40.967
YEAH.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.000
WHAT DOES THIS
MAKE YOU THINK OF?

20:22.667 --> 20:23.667
AND, UM,

20:23.667 --> 20:26.800
WHAT'S THIS
MAKE YOU THINK OF?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.867
AND WHAT
ABOUT THIS?
