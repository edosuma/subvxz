27:20.764 --> 27:23.224
And now that I'm making
real money at my firm,

27:23.308 --> 27:24.392
you can go to a better school,

27:24.476 --> 27:27.354
enroll in a professional
ballet academy.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.773
Dad and I are a team...

27:29.856 --> 27:32.108
and I am not moving
to Pittsburgh.

27:32.192 --> 27:35.153
-But why stay in Millwood?
-Dad is here...

27:36.112 --> 27:37.530
-and you aren't.
-Zeke: Faran!

27:37.614 --> 27:39.491
Do not talk to your
mother that way.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.618
And forget about me for a sec.
Think about your future.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.662
The only reason
Mom's pushing for this

27:44.746 --> 27:45.455
is so she can control my life

27:45.538 --> 27:47.874
even more than
she already does.

27:47.957 --> 27:51.419
Oh, I see.
So, I can pay for your life...

27:52.587 --> 27:54.964
I just can't control it.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.299
-Got it.
-No way am I moving.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.260
Let's see what happens Friday.

28:01.971 --> 28:05.225
Imogen:
There was this girl,
Angela Waters.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.769
She went to Millwood High...

28:07.852 --> 28:10.605
and killed herself
at the rave from the flyer.

28:10.688 --> 28:14.734
But her body wasn't
found until much later.

28:14.818 --> 28:18.321
Didn't anyone
call the police
or an ambulance?

28:18.405 --> 28:19.906
You would think...

28:19.989 --> 28:20.657
but not for days.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.410
People thought she'd
run away.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.955
Anyway,
there's a shrine
to Angela now

28:27.038 --> 28:28.248
at the warehouse.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.250
And while I was there,

28:30.333 --> 28:31.793
someone else was
creeping around, too.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.464
A, I think.

28:37.173 --> 28:39.259
Oh my god.

28:39.342 --> 28:40.927
-(phones buzz, ding)
-(both gasp)

28:41.010 --> 28:42.262
Is it from him?

28:45.515 --> 28:46.683
No, from Kelly.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.353
Inviting me to Karen's funeral.

28:50.437 --> 28:54.107
-Weird.
-Is that tomorrow?

28:54.190 --> 28:55.942
-Thursday.
-Great.

28:56.025 --> 28:56.734
So, we can stake out
the warehouse tomorrow.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.656
To find out who A is
in case they come back.

29:05.118 --> 29:05.827
Mouse:
Where are Tabby and Imogen?

29:07.454 --> 29:08.746
I didn't ask them to come.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.333
Shady.
Why not?

29:14.043 --> 29:15.253
Look...

29:15.336 --> 29:16.880
at the disciplinary hearing,

29:16.963 --> 29:19.799
I think we should say
the video was all
Imogen and Tabby.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.886
You mean...
throw them under the bus?

29:22.969 --> 29:23.970
We didn't do anything.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.389
We went along with it

29:26.473 --> 29:28.308
and we handed out flyers,
and invited people.

29:28.391 --> 29:29.392
Imogen had Tyler's phone.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.685
Tabby organized a screening.

29:30.768 --> 29:33.730
That makes them
a lot more culpable.

29:33.813 --> 29:35.690
We're all headed
for an iceberg.

29:35.773 --> 29:39.110
-But... we can dodge it.
-By turning on our friends.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.906
Yeah, but...
are they our friends?

29:42.989 --> 29:45.033
What's the problem, Honrada?

29:46.826 --> 29:46.868
Maybe...

29:48.870 --> 29:50.163
A is testing us.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.998
What are you talking about?

29:52.081 --> 29:54.501
What if he's just
watching us right now,

29:54.584 --> 29:55.793
seeing what we do
if we turn on each other.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.713
Sis...

29:58.796 --> 30:00.215
you need your devices back.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.342
-You're starting
to get paranoid.
-Noa: Yeah.

30:02.425 --> 30:05.011
And I'm a lot more fucking
scared of Sheriff Beasley

30:05.094 --> 30:06.596
than I am of A right now.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.015
This is my last strike.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.726
You guys...

30:11.809 --> 30:14.020
if I go down,
that's it for me.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.189
And it was Imogen's idea,

30:16.272 --> 30:17.482
and Tabby does work
at the movie theater.

30:17.565 --> 30:20.235
That's all we have to say.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.988
That they knew exactly
what they were doing,
and... we didn't.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.705
I just charged the battery.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.542
If A comes back, we'll
have photographic proof.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.459
Hm.

30:36.543 --> 30:37.794
-(phone buzzes)
-(gasps)

30:37.877 --> 30:38.711
Oh my god, is it from A?

30:39.546 --> 30:43.424
No, it's from my boss.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.718
-The cute one?
-The manipulative one.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.221
-He has something I need.
-(clattering)

30:48.304 --> 30:50.807
Oh my god. It's him.

30:52.767 --> 30:53.851
(tense music playing)

30:58.022 --> 31:00.024
Mom?

31:00.400 --> 31:02.193
Tabitha?

31:02.819 --> 31:03.820
Uh...

31:03.903 --> 31:06.114
what are you doing here?

31:06.739 --> 31:08.866
Paying my respects.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.367
(both gasp)

31:09.450 --> 31:11.744
To Angela Waters?

31:12.161 --> 31:13.997
Yes.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.209
Who was she?

31:20.712 --> 31:25.216
Angela was one of our
classmates who died...

31:26.301 --> 31:28.011
tragically.

31:28.094 --> 31:30.638
At that warehouse, right?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.682
She killed herself,
like Karen?

31:35.310 --> 31:37.145
Sidney:
Pretty much
everyone was there,

31:37.228 --> 31:40.023
all the kids,
to celebrate Y2K.

31:40.106 --> 31:43.651
And... this poor girl,
Angela, arrives.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.487
She was just one
of those unlucky girls.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.907
We tried to befriend her.

31:49.991 --> 31:54.370
But... Angela was damaged
in ways we couldn't imagine.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.622
Problems at home.

31:55.705 --> 31:59.292
No father,
mentally ill mother.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.421
She jumped to her death

32:03.504 --> 32:05.048
right at the stroke of midnight.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.884
It was... horrific.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.636
(people screaming)

32:12.597 --> 32:14.015
Then what happened?

32:14.098 --> 32:16.476
Well, everyone just... fled.

32:16.559 --> 32:19.562
Why didn't you
call the police?

32:19.646 --> 32:21.022
I suppose we all thought
that someone else would.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.234
Two days later, someone did.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.072
Angela's death was
ruled what it was...

32:30.031 --> 32:31.074
a suicide.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.328
Imogen:
In the article I read,

32:35.411 --> 32:36.537
there was no mention
of the rave.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.165
Well, there wouldn't have been.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.833
No, it was never
spoken about.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.836
But someone must've
asked or investigated

32:43.920 --> 32:44.837
why Angela was
at that warehouse.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.382
If it had been anyone else,
they would've.

32:47.465 --> 32:51.010
But not Angela.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.137
Not the crazy girl
with the crazy mother.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.473
Less said about them,
the better.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.770
Every so often,
I-I-I go there
to pay my respects.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.480
What were you two doing there?

33:02.563 --> 33:06.651
I'm trying...
to figure out what
happened to my mom.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.861
I'm being
a supportive friend.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.115
Right before my mom
killed herself...

33:12.782 --> 33:15.326
she got this flyer...

33:16.744 --> 33:17.620
for the party that
was held there.

33:17.704 --> 33:20.331
That you were at too, Mom.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.542
Imogen:
Ms. Hayworth...

33:22.625 --> 33:24.544
d-do you think
that's why my mom--

33:26.170 --> 33:28.589
is it, is it possible
that she felt guilty

33:28.673 --> 33:30.133
about what happened to Angela

33:30.216 --> 33:31.801
and that's why she--

33:34.053 --> 33:35.012
I think we all felt guilty.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.226
Imogen, no one was kinder
to Angela than your mother.

33:40.309 --> 33:41.477
She was the best of us.

33:43.312 --> 33:46.065
Angela was just...
a lost soul.

33:47.316 --> 33:49.152
I had, uh...

33:50.319 --> 33:52.071
started to think
that maybe Karen

33:52.155 --> 33:53.614
had given my mom this flyer,

33:53.698 --> 33:55.533
but...

33:55.616 --> 33:57.160
it doesn't feel right anymore.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.454
They were all over
the school back in the day.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.122
I don't imagine...

34:01.205 --> 34:03.958
it was anyone in our circle,
but I could ask them.

34:04.041 --> 34:07.587
-Would you, Ms. Hayworth?
-Of course, sweetheart. Yeah.

34:08.504 --> 34:10.298
Should we get outta here?

34:10.381 --> 34:13.134
I... have to pick up
my paycheck at the Orpheum.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.388
My last paycheck.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.557
Okay. See ya at home.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.642
(doorbell rings)

34:23.978 --> 34:25.021
There she is.

34:25.855 --> 34:26.689
Come on in, Tabs.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.983
Water just
started boiling.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.653
Hope you like pasta.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.786
Thought we could have
a mini-international film
festival this month.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.454
Every night,
a different country

34:41.537 --> 34:43.080
to help get your
mind off things.

34:43.164 --> 34:46.042
Like, tonight is
my grandmother's
spaghetti arrabiata,

34:46.125 --> 34:47.126
paired with some nice vino

34:47.210 --> 34:48.961
from Francis Ford Coppola's
vineyard.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.214
And one of my favorite
Italian movies.

34:52.340 --> 34:56.177
-What about the,
the flash drive, Wes?
-Mm.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.596
You'll get it.
I promise.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.556
But... dinner
and a movie first.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.976
I was thinking
Dario Argento.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.145
The obvious choice
would be "Suspiria."

35:06.229 --> 35:07.647
Hey, c-could you
pour me a glass

35:07.730 --> 35:09.816
and another for yourself?

35:11.609 --> 35:13.486
(knocks on door)

35:15.822 --> 35:16.989
I thought you
were mad at me.

35:18.741 --> 35:19.033
Is your mom here?

35:21.077 --> 35:21.118
At the hospital.

35:22.745 --> 35:23.120
Can I come in?

35:29.210 --> 35:31.295
I wasn't mad at you.

35:33.005 --> 35:34.090
Was just confused...

35:36.592 --> 35:37.051
and scared.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.931
When I heard about
the drug test, it...

35:42.014 --> 35:45.518
took me back...
to when you were arrested.

35:49.605 --> 35:52.275
I didn't fail
my drug test, Shawn.

35:52.358 --> 35:54.193
I've never even tried drugs.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.988
-Noa--
-I'm gonna tell you a secret...

35:57.071 --> 35:58.698
that no one else knows.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.035
But you can't say
anything to anyone...

36:04.745 --> 36:05.037
ever.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.624
I-I swear.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.127
The night
I got arrested...

36:13.546 --> 36:15.673
I was covering for my mom.

36:16.591 --> 36:17.091
They were her drugs...

36:19.051 --> 36:20.219
not mine.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.889
Hold up,
you took the rap
for your mother?

36:22.972 --> 36:26.058
I didn't have a choice.

36:26.142 --> 36:30.479
-She would've lost everything.
-What kind of mother does
that to her own daughter?

36:30.563 --> 36:33.566
-A desperate one.
-Yeah, but to throw
you under the bus?

36:36.903 --> 36:41.240
-(sniffles)
-Hey... I'm sorry I didn't
believe you, babe.

36:51.375 --> 36:52.877
Fun fact...

36:52.960 --> 36:56.797
giallo is the Italian
word for yellow

36:56.881 --> 36:59.592
which is where
the term comes from.

36:59.675 --> 37:02.511
-Uh, because there used
to be these incredibly cheap...
-(heart beating)

37:02.595 --> 37:05.765
...super popular pulp novels
published in Italy,

37:05.848 --> 37:08.142
uh, that had yellow covers

37:08.225 --> 37:10.394
because yellow was
the cheapest ink.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.772
And, of course, the color red

37:12.855 --> 37:16.108
-is most commonly
associated with...
-(breathing heavily)

37:16.192 --> 37:18.444
-Tabby: Fuck this.
-...giallo movies

37:18.527 --> 37:19.612
because of all the blood.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.407
Now, I thought...

37:23.491 --> 37:26.285
we could watch "Profondo Rosso,"

37:26.369 --> 37:27.620
AKA, "Deep Red"...

37:30.665 --> 37:35.294
which is, to me,
Argento's masterpiece.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.129
("Sharp As a Knife"
by Danny Ayer playing)

37:42.134 --> 37:43.761
♪ Sharp as a knife ♪

37:46.055 --> 37:47.139
(somber organ playing)

37:53.020 --> 37:54.814
Clergy:
We've gathered here today

37:54.897 --> 37:57.984
to pay our respects
to our sister in Christ,

37:58.067 --> 38:00.319
Karen Elizabeth Beasley.

38:00.403 --> 38:04.240
During trials like this,
you may ask yourself, Lord,

38:04.323 --> 38:07.576
why would you let a thing
like this happen...

38:08.744 --> 38:12.999
to someone so young,
so beloved?

38:13.082 --> 38:17.586
Why would you test her father,
her mother, her sister,

38:17.670 --> 38:18.212
in such an unspeakable way?

38:20.381 --> 38:22.216
Proverbs 3:5,

38:22.299 --> 38:24.343
-"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart...
-(wailing)

38:24.427 --> 38:27.680
-...and lean not on your
own understanding."
-Mom.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.181
-Come on. Mom.
-"In all your ways

38:29.265 --> 38:29.849
-"acknowledge him...
-Let's go. Come on.

38:29.932 --> 38:33.060
"and he shall direct your path.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.022
"Be not wise in thine own eyes.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.400
-(crying)
-"Fear the Lord,
and depart from evil...

38:42.528 --> 38:46.240
No. What are,
what are you doing here?

38:46.323 --> 38:51.579
-I-I am so sorry, Mrs. Beasley.
-Martha: How dare you?

38:51.662 --> 38:55.374
-Do you not have
an ounce of shame?
-Mom, please.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.210

Friend?

I pray you burn in hell

to my sweet Karen.

and that I should
be the one punished.

Kelly Beasley came
to see me this morning.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.047
She admitted that Karen
was in the rafters

43:12.131 --> 43:15.009
with the specific intention
of harming Imogen

43:15.092 --> 43:17.303
at the Spirit Week dance.

43:17.386 --> 43:19.138
She even provided
some evidence.

-The bucket?
-I can't say any more.

43:22.725 --> 43:26.520
But it seems that what
we have here is a tragic

43:26.603 --> 43:28.439

43:28.522 --> 43:31.066
What does that mean for us?
For our daughters?

43:31.859 --> 43:34.320
Given these new circumstances,

43:34.403 --> 43:37.114
I don't believe the committee
is seeking expulsion anymore.

43:39.116 --> 43:42.995

have been discussed.

right before Davie died,

44:33.003 --> 44:36.423
someone sent her that
old red flyer for the rave.

44:38.008 --> 44:40.761

and I only told them
what everyone knows
to be the truth.

44:46.683 --> 44:49.645
Great... but who sent
Davie that flyer?

44:52.314 --> 44:54.024
It's been months
and none of us

44:54.108 --> 44:55.734
have gotten anything
like that, right,

44:55.818 --> 44:57.111
since Davie died?

44:57.194 --> 44:59.196
Then it was a fluke.

44:59.279 --> 45:01.573
And let's take the win here.

-Why the change of heart?
-She's not a monster.
