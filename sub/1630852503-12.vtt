00:04.104 --> 00:06.106
<i>Previously on</i> Good Sam...

00:06.172 --> 00:07.307
Your proctorship is over.

00:07.374 --> 00:08.375
I'm back in surgery.

00:08.441 --> 00:10.343
I slept with someone else.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.645
{\an6}I feel really awful
about this whole Tim thing.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.645
It was you.

00:12.712 --> 00:15.115
You want my job?
Come and get it.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.149
I plan to.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.584
I just wonder if any part of you

00:17.650 --> 00:19.586
is hoping I'd keep
a job search local.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.121
Don't put this on me.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.523
{\an3}My mom found
a field report

00:23.590 --> 00:25.392
{\an3}from the accident. It says
your dad was drunk that night.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.694
I actually thought we were
starting to put this behind us.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.629
My mom's not gonna
let that happen.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.731
Tina knows my secret, so now
you need to know the truth.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.500
He's doing this for us.

00:33.566 --> 00:35.368
{\an1}Today you were
the man I married,

00:35.435 --> 00:36.636
not the man I divorced.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.338
(soft sigh)

00:45.578 --> 00:48.348
{\an3}Mmm. Hmm.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.221
{\an3}Oh, no.

00:57.524 --> 01:00.593
Oh, no! No! Oh.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.195
{\an4}Griff.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.195
(groans softly)

01:02.262 --> 01:03.563
Wake up, Griff.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.533
{\an4}Griff!

01:05.230 --> 01:06.533
{\an3}No!

01:06.599 --> 01:08.835
{\an1}(sighs)

01:10.336 --> 01:12.439
Oh, good morning to you.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.607
I can't believe we slept here.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.409
I think I lost my mind.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.378
Oh. Think I lost my pants.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.712
How could I let this happen?

01:19.779 --> 01:21.714
What am I gonna tell Asher?

01:21.781 --> 01:23.349
Tell him the truth.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.585
{\an3}You had a few drinks,
you slept at the office.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.520
{\an5}You don't have
to tell him the whole story.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.520
{\an1}No.

01:27.587 --> 01:31.324
{\an1}He can never know
the whole story. No one can.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.326
I can't have my whole life
blowing up

01:33.393 --> 01:36.329
over some mindless indiscretion
with my ex-husband.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.232
{\an3}Oh, you were always
so good at pillow talk.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.734
Griff, listen to me.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.603
This is serious.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.605
I know. You know I do.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.707
{\an3}I have my own relationship
to think about.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.742
{\an3}I don't want anyone
to get hurt.

01:49.809 --> 01:53.680
Then we have to put this behind
us and forget it ever happened.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.587
{\an3}Here. Let me
get that for you.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.689
{\an5}Oh, thank you.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.689
{\an3}(laughs)

02:02.755 --> 02:05.225
{\an5}You are in a hurry.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.225
Yeah, the board made a decision

02:05.291 --> 02:06.493
{\an1}about my dad's
drunk driving thing.

02:06.559 --> 02:07.794
I want to get in there

02:07.861 --> 02:09.429
{\an1}'cause we're expecting
a phone call any minute.

02:09.496 --> 02:11.397
Uh, I guess
they're deciding his punishment

02:11.464 --> 02:13.666
{\an5}before they get to my mom.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.666
What do you think
they're gonna do?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.602
Mm, I think they're gonna
take away her board seat.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.237
They can do that?

02:17.303 --> 02:18.805
{\an3}They can if one
of their members is caught

02:18.872 --> 02:20.640
taking kickbacks.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.276
Look, the board has zero
tolerance for her misconduct.

02:23.343 --> 02:26.312
{\an1}Good. She would've sold this
place if we hadn't stopped her.

02:26.379 --> 02:27.680
Ah, but we did stop her.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.749
You and me.

02:33.753 --> 02:35.622
Can you hurry up?

02:35.688 --> 02:36.856
Yeah, it's one leg
at a time, Vivian.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.458
{\an5}That's how pants work.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.458
{\an1}SAM:
Mom?

02:38.525 --> 02:39.859
(knocking)

02:39.926 --> 02:41.761
{\an1}Okay.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.396
{\an6}SAM:
Hello?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.396
{\an1}(gasps)

02:43.463 --> 02:45.298
{\an5}It's Sam. It's Sam. It's Sam.

02:43.463 --> 02:45.298
{\an3}Uh...

02:45.365 --> 02:46.499
{\an3}Yup.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.168
(groans softly)

02:50.703 --> 02:51.838
Morning.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.874
Sam! Hey, we were just, um...

02:54.941 --> 02:56.643
I know what you were doing.

02:58.378 --> 03:00.747
I've been doing
the exact same thing.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.916
Just going over it
and over it in my mind,

03:02.982 --> 03:05.618
trying to think about
what the board is gonna say.

03:05.685 --> 03:09.522
{\an3}You know, no matter what it is,
Dad, I just want to say,

03:09.589 --> 03:11.424
I'm proud of you.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.593
Telling the truth was
the right thing to do.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.727
{\an5}I second that.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.727
(phone buzzes)

03:14.794 --> 03:15.862
{\an1}Oh.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.531
{\an6}(sighs)

03:15.929 --> 03:18.531
This is it.

03:19.632 --> 03:20.833
Yeah. Rob Griffith.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.735
{\an4}Yes.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.735
{\an3}(sighs)

03:22.802 --> 03:24.470
I've been waiting for your call.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.407
{\an1}Okay. Yeah.
No, I understand.

03:28.441 --> 03:31.744
Oh, thank you, and, uh...

03:31.811 --> 03:33.813
thank the board for me.

03:36.482 --> 03:39.452
{\an1}There's to be no
disciplinary action against me.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.454
{\an5}What?!

03:39.519 --> 03:41.454
{\an3}(chuckles)

03:41.521 --> 03:42.789
I was off the clock.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.724
There's no arrest,
police records,

03:44.791 --> 03:46.359
no need for further action.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.660
{\an5}What a relief!

03:46.426 --> 03:47.660
{\an3}Oh.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.895
That's great news, Dad.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.364
{\an5}(phone ringing)

03:48.962 --> 03:51.364
Oh. Now I'm ringing.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.501
{\an3}The board is taking
a hard line with Tina.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.769
I thought they might
do the same with you.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.771
{\an1}Well, she's an active
board member.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.840
{\an1}I guess they had
to make an example of her.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.475
{\an3}I just want
to get back to work.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.776
I think we all do.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.612
{\an6}Yeah.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.612
I don't think we all can.

04:06.713 --> 04:07.747
The board's been

04:07.814 --> 04:10.383
discussing my role
in the accident.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.651
(stammers)

04:11.718 --> 04:14.754
You weren't on duty that night,
but I was, and

04:14.821 --> 04:17.423
{\an3}when I took
the paramedic's report,

04:17.490 --> 04:19.993
{\an1}I violated my terms
of employment.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.528
They are required
to take action.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.830
What kind of action?

04:24.664 --> 04:27.634
I've been relieved
of my duties as CMO.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.573
{\an8}♪ ♪

04:41.881 --> 04:44.751
{\an9}They cannot do this.
They-they can't suspend you

04:44.817 --> 04:47.387
{\an7}for a violation
from 20 years ago

04:47.453 --> 04:48.755
{\an8}without hearing your side.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.423
{\an8}Well, they'll hear my side
when they formally

04:50.490 --> 04:51.791
{\an8}review the case in a few months.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.791
{\an9}Ugh.

04:51.858 --> 04:52.625
{\an8}A few months?

04:51.858 --> 04:52.625
{\an9}Yeah.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.360
{\an8}At the next staffing session.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.360
{\an9}No.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.662
{\an7}We have to make it
happen sooner.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.764
{\an8}I'm gonna keep calling Byron,

04:57.830 --> 04:59.399
{\an8}find out
where he stands on this.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.367
{\an8}I will gather signatures,
and I will get letters

05:01.434 --> 05:03.636
{\an9}from every department head
in this hospital. We will keep

05:03.703 --> 05:05.571
{\an8}the pressure on
until they call a hearing.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.839
{\an8}Who's gonna run your department?

05:06.906 --> 05:08.775
{\an8}Dad. His proctorship is done.

05:08.841 --> 05:09.942
{\an8}It's about to be official,

05:10.009 --> 05:11.411
{\an8}the vote is next week,

05:11.477 --> 05:12.612
{\an8}and we all know he's ready.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.681
{\an8}A transition period
might be a good thing.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.849
{\an8}Yeah, it could be great
for the team.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.920
{\an8}All right.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.690
{\an8}Thank you, both of you.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.658
{\an8}SAM:
<i>Morning, everyone.</i>

05:25.725 --> 05:29.562
{\an9}Starting today, Dr. Griffith
is officially moving back

05:29.629 --> 05:33.633
{\an9}into his role as chief,
and I know... we will all

05:33.700 --> 05:34.901
{\an9}do our best to make it
a smooth tran...

05:34.967 --> 05:36.469
{\an8}Where's the other one?

05:37.704 --> 05:39.505
{\an9}Excuse me?

05:37.704 --> 05:39.505
{\an8}There's usually one more.

05:39.572 --> 05:41.741
{\an8}Has anyone seen Isan?

05:42.842 --> 05:46.679
{\an8}He mentioned
taking a personal day.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.848
{\an8}What is a personal day?

05:48.915 --> 05:51.584
{\an8}This is because I lied to him
about the hospital sale.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.853
{\an9}I'll keep calling
and apologizing

05:53.920 --> 05:55.455
{\an8}until he calls me back.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.723
{\an7}CALEB:
Welcome back,

05:56.789 --> 05:58.658
{\an8}Dr. Griffith.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.658
{\an9}Dr. Tucker,

05:58.725 --> 06:00.827
{\an8}are you also taking
a personal day?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.596
{\an8}No.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.596
{\an9}Then maybe
you want

06:03.663 --> 06:04.897
{\an8}to prepare for rounds instead

06:04.964 --> 06:06.632
{\an8}of reclining
like a renaissance nude.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.735
{\an7}(sighs)

06:06.699 --> 06:08.735
{\an9}SAM:
Isan.

06:08.801 --> 06:09.769
{\an8}Hey, it's me.

06:09.836 --> 06:10.937
{\an8}I just really want to talk. I...

06:11.003 --> 06:13.005
{\an9}Dr. Shah, if you don't
want to be here,

06:13.072 --> 06:14.874
{\an9}there's a long line of people
waiting to take your place.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.743
{\an8}Suit up and show up,

06:16.809 --> 06:18.611
{\an7}or all your days
will be personal days

06:18.678 --> 06:20.747
{\an8}'cause you will be out of a job.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.747
{\an9}Hey--

06:20.813 --> 06:23.516
{\an9}Okay.

06:20.813 --> 06:23.516
{\an8}This is not a wellness retreat.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.852
{\an8}We're not here to talk
about your feelings.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.553
{\an9}Because you don't care
about people's feelings.

06:27.620 --> 06:28.821
{\an8}New chief is the same

06:28.888 --> 06:29.889
{\an8}as the old chief.

06:29.956 --> 06:32.558
{\an8}He doesn't care
about anybody else but himself.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.894
{\an8}(door opens)

06:34.961 --> 06:37.797
{\an7}Hey, hey, hey,
what was that all about?

06:37.864 --> 06:39.966
{\an8}It's over, Griff.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.701
{\an8}Okay? We are done.

06:41.768 --> 06:44.504
{\an8}Hey, just-just talk to me.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.972
{\an8}Talk to you? Okay.

06:46.038 --> 06:48.574
{\an8}I saw you last night
with Vivian.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.911
{\an7}Look, I...

06:51.978 --> 06:53.980
{\an8}I didn't know how to tell you...

06:54.046 --> 06:55.515
{\an8}Didn't know how to tell me?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.884
{\an8}There is nothing to tell.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.519
{\an8}I was there, and I saw you!

06:59.585 --> 07:00.686
{\an8}Lex?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.121
{\an8}Stay out of my way today!

07:03.156 --> 07:05.658
{\an8}(door closes)

07:05.725 --> 07:07.860
{\an8}SAM:
<i>What's wrong with Lex?</i>

07:07.927 --> 07:09.896
{\an8}Why would you assume I know?

07:09.962 --> 07:11.531
{\an8}Are you saying
you don't know?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.566
{\an7}I'm saying that's personal,
this is professional,

07:13.633 --> 07:15.635
{\an8}and I'd ask you to keep
the two things separate.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.937
{\an9}Dad...

07:15.701 --> 07:17.937
{\an8}Please, Sam.

07:18.004 --> 07:19.539
{\an8}Keep them separate.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.541
{\an8}First day back in charge.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.609
I need to focus.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.012
{\an3}This is Tanya White.
She was referred

07:26.078 --> 07:27.680
to us with shortness of breath.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.949
And I get tired really easily.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.552
I feel like I could pass out
from hardly doing anything.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.687
{\an6}SAM: Hmm.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.687
She always had
so much energy.

07:34.754 --> 07:35.988
{\an1}She's the reason
we bought a vineyard.

07:36.055 --> 07:37.957
{\an6}A vineyard?

07:36.055 --> 07:37.957
{\an1}Mm.

07:38.024 --> 07:41.127
Six acres in Italy.
It's our retirement plan.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.895
{\an6}Oh.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.895
{\an1}CURTIS:
The idea was

07:42.962 --> 07:44.096
we'd tend it
together, but

07:44.163 --> 07:45.565
{\an1}lately, Tanya barely
has enough energy

07:45.631 --> 07:46.632
to go get the mail.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.835
{\an3}No family history
of heart disease, cholesterol

07:48.901 --> 07:50.736
{\an1}and blood pressure
within normal range.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.972
{\an3}What could explain the fatigue
and lightheadedness? Dr. Tucker?

07:53.039 --> 07:56.909
Cardiomegaly worsens with age,
and causes symptoms like these.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.578
{\an3}It's also more gradual
than the onset

07:58.644 --> 08:00.713
{\an3}of these symptoms.
Dr. Costa?

08:00.780 --> 08:02.148
{\an1}Symptoms of cardiomyopathy
can appear suddenly

08:02.215 --> 08:04.150
{\an1}even if it's been present
for some time.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.785
{\an1}An echocardiogram
would be a good next step.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.854
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.023
We're gonna run some tests.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.692
Okay.

08:12.758 --> 08:13.993
Pretty color.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.862
Oh, thank you.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.731
Yeah, it's better
than what's going on underneath.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.700
My nails look like I've been
working in the vineyard

08:20.766 --> 08:21.901
and we haven't even
gotten there yet.

08:21.968 --> 08:25.972
{\an3}Your nails look like they're
dirty even when they're clean?

08:26.038 --> 08:27.707
Exactly.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.710
Any cracked nails?

08:30.776 --> 08:32.010
How'd you know that?

08:32.078 --> 08:33.813
{\an1}GRIFF:
Okay.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.082
{\an3}Need a cardiac MRI, and
that polish needs to come off.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.083
{\an5}Why?

08:36.148 --> 08:38.083
{\an3}SAM:
Uh,

08:38.150 --> 08:39.719
what looks like dirt
could be something

08:39.784 --> 08:41.020
called "splinter hemorrhages."

08:41.087 --> 08:42.688
Debris thrown
from inside the heart

08:42.755 --> 08:44.056
that collects
in the extremities.

08:44.123 --> 08:45.825
What causes that?

08:45.892 --> 08:46.859
A mass, usually.

08:46.926 --> 08:49.762
{\an1}M-Mass?

08:49.829 --> 08:50.997
L-Like a tumor? Are you saying

08:51.063 --> 08:52.164
my wife has a tumor
in her heart?

08:52.231 --> 08:55.167
{\an3}It's too soon to say
without imaging.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.970
We will get her in there
as fast as we can.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.739
{\an1}JOEY: How did we get
in here so fast?

08:59.805 --> 09:02.041
{\an3}There was a long line when I
checked the radiology schedule.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.676
I bumped her up.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.645
{\an5}We can do that?

09:03.743 --> 09:05.645
{\an1}Chief can.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.013
Sam never did.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.718
Sam never had one of these.

09:14.086 --> 09:15.988
Oh... Gentlemen,

09:16.055 --> 09:18.057
the atrial myxoma.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.660
{\an4}JOEY:
I've never seen
anything like that.

09:20.726 --> 09:21.961
And you never will again.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.030
{\an1}It's the Loch Ness monster
of tumors.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.665
Zoom in on that?

09:25.731 --> 09:27.700
A tumor like this

09:27.767 --> 09:29.168
is big news.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.270
The network of blood vessels

09:31.337 --> 09:33.272
{\an1}feeding the mass
is incredibly complex.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.074
{\an3}How do you
remove it?

09:35.141 --> 09:36.676
Most of the time, you don't.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.244
Not successfully, anyway.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.146
We need to strategize.

09:40.212 --> 09:42.682
Dr. Tucker,
find any case history

09:42.748 --> 09:44.283
you can on tumors
of this magnitude.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.953
{\an1}Dr. Costa, I need
a 3D model reconstruction

09:47.019 --> 09:48.955
of this heart
in the SIM lab right away.

09:49.021 --> 09:52.291
{\an1}All right, let's get
some measurements on this baby.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.093
(siren wailing)

09:54.160 --> 09:57.697
Brian Jenkins, 11 years old,
blunt chest trauma

09:57.763 --> 10:00.099
{\an5}after a skateboarding accident.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.099
{\an3}KACE:
Do you know if Tim and Joey

10:00.166 --> 10:02.101
{\an3}worked things out? I wish
I'd known they were together.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.269
I wish I didn't know
anything about this.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.737
One, two.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.706
{\an5}Three. Here we go.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.706
All right.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.708
You said he's having
problems breathing?

10:08.774 --> 10:11.110
He fell, and when he got back
up, he wasn't breathing right.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.145
{\an1}Okay, I'm gonna listen
to your heart, kid, okay?

10:13.212 --> 10:14.981
(labored breathing)

10:15.047 --> 10:16.082
He's not moving much air.

10:16.148 --> 10:18.150
{\an3}All right, start him
on continuous nebs and give him

10:18.217 --> 10:19.719
a dose of steroids.

10:19.785 --> 10:20.753
Where's Mom?

10:20.820 --> 10:22.722
She's on her way, Bri.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.724
{\an5}(beeping)

10:22.788 --> 10:24.724
His heart rate shot up to 200.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.760
{\an3}SVT. I need six
milligrams of adenosine.

10:27.827 --> 10:28.861
You say that he fell off
of a skateboard?

10:28.928 --> 10:32.164
N-No, he was running.
Climbing, actually. A fence.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.799
Adenosine, six milligrams.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.335
{\an6}Does your brother have
a heart condition?

10:33.866 --> 10:36.335
{\an1}No. Why?

10:36.402 --> 10:38.804
Because whatever this is, it did
not come from climbing a fence.

10:42.808 --> 10:46.979
{\an3}Oh, hey. I can't get
anywhere with the board.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.015
{\an5}Another Griff mess.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.015
{\an3}Well,

10:49.081 --> 10:51.884
I think he was trying to do the
right thing. He couldn't know

10:51.951 --> 10:53.119
{\an5}how the board was gonna react.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.119
That's not what I meant.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.023
You know,
the thing about boundaries is,

10:57.089 --> 10:59.225
if you don't enforce 'em,
then they don't exist.

10:59.291 --> 11:02.061
You can't cross a line
that's been erased.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.130
What? Asher.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.098
Where were you last night?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.035
Well, like I... like I said,
I-I was working late, and...

11:09.101 --> 11:12.038
I know what you told me,
and I didn't buy it then,

11:12.104 --> 11:13.906
and I especially
don't buy it now

11:13.973 --> 11:16.108
{\an1}that I see those two
empty glasses over there

11:16.175 --> 11:18.878
and that guilty look
on your face.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.988
{\an1}That's Griff's
favorite whiskey, isn't it?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.992
Close the door.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.395
(sighs)

11:45.171 --> 11:47.406
{\an1}(scoffs)

11:47.473 --> 11:49.275
You okay, Donna?

11:49.341 --> 11:51.277
{\an5}Why do you ask?

11:49.341 --> 11:51.277
I don't know.

11:51.343 --> 11:53.379
{\an5}You seem a little...

11:51.343 --> 11:53.379
I don't like gossip.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.015
See, that's where we differ.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.284
But I also don't like the idea
of any of you being mistreated,

11:58.350 --> 11:59.919
especially Dr. Trulie.

11:59.985 --> 12:02.321
What'd you hear, Donna?

12:02.388 --> 12:04.423
(elevator bell dings)

12:04.490 --> 12:06.459
Hey.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.459
{\an1}Hey.

12:06.525 --> 12:09.295
{\an1}Um, I heard what happened
with your mom.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.030
{\an5}Ah.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.030
Is she okay?

12:11.097 --> 12:13.165
{\an3}Yeah. She's gonna
fight this.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.433
I mean, that's actually
what I've been doing--

12:14.500 --> 12:16.235
{\an3}gathering all of these
letters of support.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.003
{\an5}Mm.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.003
What about your mom?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.306
{\an6}Did the board
revoke her seat?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.306
{\an1}Ah, yes.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.441
And they found her replacement.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.477
{\an3}Is it you?

12:25.544 --> 12:27.279
{\an6}It's you!

12:25.544 --> 12:27.279
{\an1}(laughing)

12:27.346 --> 12:29.915
{\an5}I know this place--
the people and the finances.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.915
{\an3}Mm.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.485
I told them it should be me,
and they agreed.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.254
Malcolm, you're on the board.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.056
{\an4}(laughing)

12:35.321 --> 12:37.056
How does it feel?

12:37.123 --> 12:39.058
{\an1}You know, I'm getting
my head around it.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.061
But maybe some good can come out
of what happened with my mom.

12:42.128 --> 12:45.197
{\an5}I think you're gonna do a lot
of good around here.

12:42.128 --> 12:45.197
{\an1}Well, yes.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.333
But first,
I need to get your mom back.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.535
If I can finally
get this clinic approved,

12:49.602 --> 12:51.237
I need her to see it through.

12:51.303 --> 12:54.206
{\an3}Well, I was just
looking for someone

12:54.273 --> 12:56.208
{\an6}to give these letters to
on my mom's behalf.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.208
{\an1}Mm.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.210
{\an3}And now that
you're on the board,

12:58.277 --> 12:59.979
maybe that someone is you?

13:00.045 --> 13:01.347
I will see what I can do.

13:01.413 --> 13:04.517
Okay. Thank you.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.987
{\an3}I'm all caught up on Tanya.
Sorry I missed the MRI.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.488
Where's my dad?

13:09.555 --> 13:11.157
{\an1}CALEB:
In the SIM lab

13:11.223 --> 13:12.491
working on a plan
to extract the tumor.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.227
{\an5}He asked us to join him.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.227
But we didn't.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.963
{\an1}We don't think
he should be chief.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.099
Okay. Why not?

13:20.166 --> 13:23.469
Lex is our friend, and we're not
following him after what he did.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.805
What did he do?

13:30.442 --> 13:32.178
{\an5}So it's true.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.178
Oh.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.113
This thing with the two
of you-- this happened?

13:34.180 --> 13:35.981
{\an1}It was a lapse
of judgment,

13:36.048 --> 13:37.383
but in the heat of the moment,
one thing led

13:37.449 --> 13:38.984
{\an5}to another...

13:37.449 --> 13:38.984
Please stop.

13:39.051 --> 13:41.253
This is a private
and personal matter.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.989
That everyone in this
hospital knows about.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.492
{\an3}My residents are upset
because you hurt their friend.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.027
{\an3}Nothing you have
ever done

13:48.093 --> 13:49.428
{\an5}has been personal or private.

13:48.093 --> 13:49.428
{\an1}We have

13:49.495 --> 13:52.598
an atrial myxoma
of unprecedented size

13:52.665 --> 13:55.234
{\an1}and complexity to deal with.
We have no viable plan

13:55.301 --> 13:57.403
to remove it. That's all anyone
should be thinking about.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.605
They're people, Dad, not robots!
They have feelings,

13:59.672 --> 14:01.273
{\an3}and their feelings
do matter.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.608
{\an5}Not to that tumor.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.608
{\an3}That tumor

14:02.675 --> 14:04.310
{\an3}didn't sleep
with Mom last night!

14:04.376 --> 14:06.111
{\an5}Uh...

14:04.376 --> 14:06.111
{\an3}(exhales)

14:06.178 --> 14:09.281
They don't want to follow you.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.016
Then order them to.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.451
{\an5}Excuse me?

14:11.083 --> 14:12.451
You're still the chief,

14:12.518 --> 14:14.353
technically.
Get them in line.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.288
{\an1}Everyone needs
to put their personal

14:16.355 --> 14:18.591
feelings aside and get to work,

14:18.657 --> 14:20.226
including you.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.194
{\an4}(scoffs)

14:20.292 --> 14:22.194
(door closes)

14:22.261 --> 14:25.064
{\an4}Sam...

14:22.261 --> 14:25.064
{\an3}Malcolm is working
on getting you a hearing.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.032
{\an3}You should prepare
your argument.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.168
{\an6}No.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.168
{\an1}You know what? This-this thing
between me and your dad.

14:29.235 --> 14:30.502
Don't, Mom.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.371
I said that I would help you

14:32.438 --> 14:34.640
fight this because you did not
deserve what happened to you.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.244
But Lex did not deserve this,
either.

14:44.383 --> 14:48.587
So, my father hears
your concerns, and hopes

14:48.654 --> 14:50.556
that we can put aside
our personal differences

14:50.623 --> 14:53.192
and respect his authority
for the greater good.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.427
Respect his authority
for the greater good?

14:55.494 --> 14:57.196
{\an1}Mm.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.198
I think Mussolini said
something very similar.

15:00.165 --> 15:01.300
{\an3}SAM: Yeah. Joey, how
about you go down to the ER?

15:01.367 --> 15:04.603
They're always short-staffed
and could use an extra hand.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.205
And keep an eye out for Lex

15:06.272 --> 15:07.406
in case she needs
someone to talk to.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.577
Happy to jump ship
before it sinks.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.548
Looks like it's just you and me.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.517
And Griff.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.522
He never deserved you,
you're better off

15:23.589 --> 15:25.557
without him, he's dead to me.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.259
{\an5}Guess the word is out.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.259
If you need a good cry,

15:27.326 --> 15:29.328
I'm here for you.
In fact, I will join you.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.163
I don't. And I'm trying
to make a good impression

15:31.230 --> 15:32.665
{\an5}down here, okay? Move.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.665
Mm-hmm.

15:32.731 --> 15:35.367
My boss does not like drama.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.637
Got it. So maybe we'll schedule
that cry for later tonight.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.105
Deal. And while we're at it,

15:40.172 --> 15:41.273
can you help me
take these braids out?

15:41.340 --> 15:43.309
Mmm, new 'do, new you. I'm in.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.510
Whatever helps to move on.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.312
{\an1}Well, I can't move on
until I find out

15:46.378 --> 15:47.546
who Tim cheated with.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.248
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look, I know...

15:49.315 --> 15:50.649
{\an5}Hmm?

15:49.315 --> 15:50.649
{\an1}...who Griff was with,
and trust me,

15:50.716 --> 15:53.519
{\an5}it doesn't help.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.519
It'll help me.

15:53.585 --> 15:55.521
{\an4}JOEY:
He told me it actually
happened at a work party,

15:55.587 --> 15:58.691
so I'm gonna go investigate,
round up a list of suspects.

16:02.227 --> 16:03.295
Brian?

16:03.362 --> 16:04.596
{\an5}Cameron? Uh...

16:03.362 --> 16:04.596
Mom.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.401
{\an3}You were supposed
to watch out for him.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.137
Hi, honey. Hi.

16:12.204 --> 16:13.439
Hi, Ma...

16:13.505 --> 16:14.573
Okay-- What happened?

16:14.640 --> 16:17.543
Uh, he had trouble breathing
and developed an arrhythmia.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.578
{\an3}Does Brian have any
allergies that you know of?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.680
{\an6}MONIQUE:
No. No. Uh,
Cameron does--

16:21.747 --> 16:26.318
{\an1}he carries an EpiPen--
but n-not Brian.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.420
He's healthy.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.420
{\an3}So was Dad.

16:29.722 --> 16:33.392
{\an1}Their dad passed
a couple of months ago.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.593
They said his heart
just stopped.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.363
{\an6}KACE:
Sorry to hear that.
Ma'am, did--

16:37.429 --> 16:38.397
{\an1}did he happen to have
a heart condition?

16:38.464 --> 16:39.732
{\an1}High cholesterol,
blood pressure?

16:39.798 --> 16:41.166
{\an1}MONIQUE:
No.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.434
No, the doctor said
something about

16:42.501 --> 16:46.705
an abnormal EKG once,
but-but he was fine.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.640
And then he was gone.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.676
{\an5}Sudden cardiac death.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.676
Could be a lot of
causes for that.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.177
Brugada syndrome...

16:52.244 --> 16:53.412
We need an EKG.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.214
W-What's happening to me?

16:55.280 --> 16:56.448
That's what we're gonna
find out. Okay, Brian?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.583
We're gonna take
good care of you.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.319
Stay strong.

17:00.386 --> 17:01.787
Hi.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.493
(Griff moans)

17:08.560 --> 17:10.396
Isn't it beautiful?

17:10.462 --> 17:13.632
{\an3}Sure. In a life-threatening,
nearly inoperable way.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.300
{\an6}SAM:
The tumor is
encroaching

17:15.367 --> 17:16.535
in Koch's triangle.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.737
If we take too much tissue,
we'll destroy the architecture

17:18.804 --> 17:21.673
of the most critical region
of the heart and she'll die.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.209
And if you're even slightly
off, you destroy the AV node

17:24.276 --> 17:26.478
{\an3}and doom her to abnormal
conduction issues.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.748
(sighs) Still, a radical
resection is our best approach.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.651
Well, that's
the traditional approach.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.287
Which is appropriate
in this case.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.321
You'll never get all the tumor.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.289
Whatever you leave behind
will grow right back.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.324
{\an3}Well, what about
endovascular interventions?

17:39.391 --> 17:40.793
{\an5}Not aggressive enough.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.793
{\an3}CALEB:
We could try

17:40.859 --> 17:43.462
{\an5}to shrink it first and...

17:40.859 --> 17:43.462
There's not enough time.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.364
{\an1}The tumor's growth rate
is too rapid.

17:45.431 --> 17:49.601
What we need...
is the Griffith technique.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.637
What is the Griffith technique?

17:51.703 --> 17:53.338
It's not a technique,
it's a theory.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.375
{\an1}It's a theory about
a technique. Cryoablation.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.744
{\an5}He first came up with it
in med school.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.744
I came up with it in med school.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.414
Liquid nitrogen.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.316
{\an3}Kills the tumor while
avoiding the risk

18:04.383 --> 18:05.784
of taking away too much tissue.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.252
Has it ever been done?

18:07.319 --> 18:08.253
Only in his mind.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.054
You can't really run a trial.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.823
{\an3}True. But if
we replicate the surgery

18:10.889 --> 18:12.491
in a virtual
environment,

18:12.558 --> 18:15.260
{\an1}you can have as
many shots as you want.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.262
Exactly. Beam me up, Dr. Tucker.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.397
{\an6}SAM:
Don't you think
we should

18:18.464 --> 18:19.798
also be strategizing

18:19.865 --> 18:21.500
a conventional
surgical approach?

18:21.567 --> 18:23.402
If you can chart a course
through that AVM

18:23.469 --> 18:25.637
without killing her,
let me know.

18:27.339 --> 18:28.774
I see nothing.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.375
Haven't turned it on yet.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.877
Ah.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.313
Okay. You're good to go.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.581
{\an1}(laughs)

18:35.647 --> 18:36.715
{\an3}SAM:
Hmm.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.851
Oh, uh, Doctor, one more thing.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.587
Double ristretto. No sugar.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.457
Ooh...

18:46.825 --> 18:47.893
Oh.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.429
I'll get him his coffee.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.397
{\an1}Oh, and apparently,
he also needs a snack.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.699
"911 muffin."

18:53.765 --> 18:55.901
{\an3}(sighs)

18:55.968 --> 18:58.570
Look, we can do this.
We've done it before.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.306
{\an1}Yeah, that's the thing.
We know where this road goes.

19:01.373 --> 19:02.841
{\an1}And we did it before
because we didn't know

19:02.908 --> 19:04.843
{\an1}there was a better way,
but now we do.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.412
You showed it to us, Sam.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.782
Do you really want to go
back to the way it was?

19:10.849 --> 19:12.784
I need to get my mom's job back.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.720
{\an5}So I need him to take over...

19:12.851 --> 19:14.720
{\an1}DONNA:
Dr. Tucker,

19:14.786 --> 19:16.455
a Dr. Quintero called,

19:16.522 --> 19:17.856
{\an1}says you were supposed
to meet with her an hour ago?

19:17.923 --> 19:19.691
Yeah, I forgot,
I got wrapped up in the case.

19:19.758 --> 19:21.727
Uh, is it okay if I...

19:21.793 --> 19:23.495
Yeah, I'll go check on my mom.
I'll meet you in SIM lab?

19:23.562 --> 19:25.430
{\an5}Okay.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.430
{\an3}Okay.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.701
How'd it go?

19:29.768 --> 19:31.703
Uh, the board will hear your
mom's case on one condition.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.839
What's the condition?

19:33.906 --> 19:36.475
The interim CMO has
to sign off on her appeal.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.644
What interim CMO?

19:40.913 --> 19:43.515
{\an1}(gasps)
Rhonda?

19:43.582 --> 19:45.751
What can I do for you, Doctor?

19:51.924 --> 19:56.361
Well, board didn't
waste any time, did they?

19:56.428 --> 19:57.629
Ah, someone has to mind the shop

19:57.696 --> 19:58.964
while your mother's case
is pending.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.766
Mm. About that...

20:00.832 --> 20:02.868
I need your help.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.404
The board's decision
to remove my mother was...

20:05.470 --> 20:06.538
Was purely political.

20:06.605 --> 20:07.839
Your father made the mess.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.541
She was just the straw man.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.543
So you agree, it's unfair.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.644
{\an3}Of course.

20:12.711 --> 20:17.449
But fairness was never
a priority for your mother.

20:18.517 --> 20:19.918
Rhonda, look,

20:19.985 --> 20:22.754
I know you have personal
differences with my mom,

20:22.821 --> 20:24.523
and frankly, right now, so do I.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.492
{\an1}But the board won't
hear this appeal

20:27.559 --> 20:28.860
without your support.

20:28.927 --> 20:32.798
Vivian abused her power
for too long.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.634
Maybe it's not fair
that this is what unseats her,

20:35.701 --> 20:39.605
but frankly, it could have been
a hundred things before this.

20:40.672 --> 20:41.940
It's time for a change.

20:43.809 --> 20:47.446
I'm not getting anywhere
with the tumor or my mom's case,

20:47.512 --> 20:50.949
{\an1}and I'm thinking that it
might be time for a plunge.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.417
{\an3}A plunge.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.417
{\an1}Yeah.

20:52.484 --> 20:53.418
{\an6}What, now?

20:52.484 --> 20:53.418
{\an1}Yeah.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.754
What do you say?

20:55.821 --> 20:57.022
Okay, so you know that
doctor that was trying

20:57.089 --> 20:58.657
{\an3}to get in touch with
me, Dr. Quintero?

20:58.724 --> 21:00.559
Um, she works for
Harbor Memorial.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.561
They have an opening in
their residency program.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.697
She's here to interview me.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.966
Why would they interview
someone who didn't apply?

21:08.033 --> 21:10.636
{\an4}I don't...

21:08.033 --> 21:10.636
Sam, I did apply.

21:10.702 --> 21:14.640
Caleb... do you want to leave?

21:14.706 --> 21:16.908
I don't know, Sam.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.977
With your dad in charge again,

21:19.044 --> 21:20.812
feels like we're
going backwards.

21:20.879 --> 21:22.648
Right.

21:24.516 --> 21:25.717
Don't let me hold you up.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.985
Sam...

21:27.052 --> 21:29.321
No, have a great interview.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.292
(sighs)

21:36.728 --> 21:38.597
{\an1}I've ruled out two paramedics
and an orderly.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.666
{\an1}But I think he's a prime
candidate. What do you think?

21:42.968 --> 21:44.469
If you want to talk
about Tim's cheating,

21:44.536 --> 21:45.637
talk about it with Tim.

21:45.704 --> 21:46.938
{\an1}Fine.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.006
Somebody help!

21:51.677 --> 21:53.478
{\an5}What's happening?

21:51.677 --> 21:53.478
He's in unstable V tach.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.714
Get the pacer pads on him.
We got to shock him out of it.

21:58.717 --> 21:59.751
(high-pitched beeping)

21:59.818 --> 22:00.852
(whirring)

22:00.919 --> 22:03.021
Charging. Clear.

22:03.088 --> 22:04.890
Is this the Brugada syndrome?

22:04.956 --> 22:05.757
No, it's not Brugada.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.059
It didn't work.
He's back in V tach.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.894
Another 150 of amio.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.629
{\an3}Increase to 200 joules
and shock again.

22:10.696 --> 22:11.963
{\an1}LEX:
Clear.

22:12.030 --> 22:12.964
(device discharges)

22:13.031 --> 22:14.032
(beeping continues)

22:15.600 --> 22:16.968
He's maxed out on
antiarrhythmics.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.706
I have an idea.

22:23.108 --> 22:24.609
{\an3}Double sequential
external cardioversion?

22:24.676 --> 22:26.578
{\an1}Took the words
right out of my mouth.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.084
{\an5}(high-pitched whir)

22:30.182 --> 22:32.084
Ready?

22:32.150 --> 22:34.052
{\an3}Clear.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.052
{\an1}Clear.

22:34.119 --> 22:36.054
One, two, three.

22:37.923 --> 22:38.957
(monitor beeping steadily)

22:39.024 --> 22:40.892
He's back in sinus. It worked.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.627
I mean, yeah,
but his pressure's still low.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.795
Let's get him on an epi drip.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.597
Somebody want to tell me
what I'm missing?

22:47.899 --> 22:48.834
(monitor beeping rapidly)

22:48.900 --> 22:50.035
Acute heart failure.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.603
Her tumor is obstructing
the valve.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.805
Get the intra-aortic
balloon pump ready.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.741
I know she's out,
but sedate her anyway.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.075
{\an3}Should I page the rest
of the team again?

22:57.142 --> 22:58.944
I think I'm it.
Let's get this catheter

22:59.010 --> 23:00.946
into her femoral artery.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.416
Ready?

23:05.217 --> 23:07.085
I'm into the aorta.

23:07.152 --> 23:08.820
Ultrasound?

23:11.123 --> 23:12.858
{\an1}Confirming
the balloon's position.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.127
{\an1}Good.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.995
It's in place. Turn it on.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.131
(beeps)

23:19.197 --> 23:20.999
{\an5}CURTIS: What are you doing?

23:19.197 --> 23:20.999
SAM: The balloon should reduce

23:21.066 --> 23:23.635
the workload of her heart and
allow it to pump more blood.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.809
{\an1}(exhales)
Okay.

23:30.876 --> 23:31.910
It's working.

23:31.977 --> 23:34.079
You got this?

23:31.977 --> 23:34.079
{\an3}Yeah.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.981
The device is working,

23:36.047 --> 23:37.983
but it's gonna take hours
to reach maximum effect.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.886
When are you going
to take the tumor out?

23:40.952 --> 23:42.754
As soon as I know
that we can do it safely.

23:42.821 --> 23:45.724
But it hasn't been done
successfully, though, has it?

23:46.758 --> 23:48.193
That's what the reporter said.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.196
What reporter?

23:53.031 --> 23:54.866
(beeping)

23:58.670 --> 23:59.771
(grunts)

23:59.838 --> 24:01.706
{\an1}(scoffs)
According to this

24:01.773 --> 24:04.209
highly flawed video game,
I just killed the patient

24:04.276 --> 24:06.745
{\an1}18 times.

24:06.812 --> 24:10.081
{\an3}Did you call a medical
journal about our patient?

24:10.148 --> 24:11.616
I called about the tumor.

24:11.683 --> 24:12.884
I said nothing
about the patient.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.120
We do not alert the press to
patients currently in our care.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.222
The tumor is a significant
medical finding.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.824
What's the problem?

24:18.890 --> 24:20.091
You are, Dad.

24:20.158 --> 24:22.060
Do you really
not see that?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.862
Mom lost her job because of you.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.831
{\an5}Well, I'll...

24:23.929 --> 24:25.831
Patient feels violated

24:25.897 --> 24:27.165
because of you.

24:27.232 --> 24:28.934
Caleb is interviewing
for another job.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.735
{\an5}Well, that...

24:29.000 --> 24:30.735
Joey is hiding in Trauma.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.037
{\an5}And Isan will not call me back.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.037
{\an1}(sighs)

24:32.103 --> 24:33.738
The department is falling apart.

24:33.805 --> 24:34.906
The department is fine.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.174
No one thinks this is fine.

24:36.241 --> 24:39.044
The chief does.
You stepped aside, remember?

24:39.110 --> 24:41.046
Yes, because I didn't like
who I was becoming.

24:41.112 --> 24:42.814
Because I'm a better chief.

24:42.881 --> 24:45.750
I never said that.

24:45.817 --> 24:46.818
No, I'm saying it.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.854
And what I say goes.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.889
Because I'm the chief.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.891
{\an4}(clears throat)
Mm.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.891
{\an3}(sighs)

24:52.958 --> 24:55.527
{\an3}Good luck not killing
her a 19th time.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.167
♪ ♪

25:05.971 --> 25:07.839
What are you doing?

25:07.906 --> 25:09.074
(clears throat)

25:11.276 --> 25:14.679
I'm jumping into a tub
of ice water to clear my head.

25:14.746 --> 25:17.816
I have a better way to do that.

25:18.884 --> 25:20.685
Can I wear my robe?

25:20.752 --> 25:23.788
{\an1}(chuckles)
If you want.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.791
{\an1}Uh, though, you will need
a pair of socks.

25:34.065 --> 25:38.003
Has anyone ever told you
that bowling is deeply uncool?

25:46.177 --> 25:47.846
That cool enough for you?

25:47.913 --> 25:49.214
I stand corrected.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.282
You're up.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.284
(scoffs)
Can't wait to follow that.

25:52.350 --> 25:53.952
{\an3}(laughs)

25:56.988 --> 25:58.256
{\an1}(exhales)

26:07.132 --> 26:08.199
Do you have any tips?

26:08.266 --> 26:10.335
Uh, yeah, don't do that.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.038
{\an5}Great. Thank you.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.038
(both laugh)

26:13.104 --> 26:15.974
Something is different
about you.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.809
You have a little spring
in your step.

26:17.876 --> 26:19.844
Must be the bowling shoes.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.079
I don't think it's the shoes.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.914
I think being on the board
suits you.

26:24.282 --> 26:27.352
You know what? It does.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.954
Which is weird.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.822
Why is that weird?

26:30.889 --> 26:32.357
{\an3}Well, I mean, nothing's
really changed since I got

26:32.424 --> 26:35.126
{\an3}the board seat, but
everything feels different.

26:35.193 --> 26:36.828
Think about your day.

26:36.895 --> 26:39.064
{\an5}Oh, no. I'd really rather not.

26:36.895 --> 26:39.064
{\an3}(laughs)

26:39.130 --> 26:40.966
(sighs)

26:44.235 --> 26:46.972
{\an5}Just a classic overcorrection.

26:44.235 --> 26:46.972
{\an3}Yeah.

26:49.040 --> 26:52.377
{\an3}How many things in your day
are decided by somebody else?

26:52.444 --> 26:54.245
Uh-- Your dad calls
a press conference,

26:54.312 --> 26:55.380
you got to deal with it;

26:55.447 --> 26:56.982
your mom's in trouble,

26:57.048 --> 26:58.149
{\an3}you got to deal
with that; Rhonda

26:58.216 --> 27:02.153
doesn't want to help you,
now you got to deal with that.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.389
Now that I am
on the board,

27:04.456 --> 27:07.025
I realize that I don't want

27:07.092 --> 27:08.927
{\an1}to have to deal with
other people's decisions,

27:08.994 --> 27:10.662
I want to make my own.

27:11.529 --> 27:13.999
It's like I went
from being the pins...

27:21.006 --> 27:22.674
To being the ball.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.409
Mm. And it feels good.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.312
{\an3}Okay, so...

27:27.379 --> 27:30.048
{\an3}is there another board seat
coming up for me, or...?

27:30.115 --> 27:32.417
{\an1}See, that's the thing.
You don't need a board seat.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.352
{\an1}You just need to decide
that you're not gonna let

27:34.419 --> 27:36.154
anybody else run the game.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.225
Stop being a pin.

27:41.259 --> 27:43.728
"Stop being a pin."

27:45.397 --> 27:48.099
Our relationship was a pin.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.335
{\an1}You know, we kept
getting hit by things

27:50.402 --> 27:52.037
{\an1}that were out
of our control.

27:52.103 --> 27:54.239
It's like we never had a chance.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.775
I see what you mean.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.378
I think if things were
different around here,

28:00.445 --> 28:03.214
they'd be different for us, too.

28:08.753 --> 28:10.288
Your turn.

28:20.298 --> 28:21.966
So, the epi drip
isn't helping Brian's heart.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.401
Vega had to call a CT consult.

28:23.468 --> 28:25.070
{\an1}Who?

28:25.136 --> 28:26.037
Me.

28:26.104 --> 28:29.074
{\an1}I just answered the page,
I'm not trying to...

28:29.140 --> 28:31.176
Patient is 11 years old, came
in with respiratory distress

28:31.242 --> 28:33.344
{\an3}and developed a
persistent arrhythmia.

28:33.411 --> 28:35.180
{\an1}Yeah, also, his, uh,
his name is Brian.

28:35.246 --> 28:36.714
It was you.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.083
{\an5}Whoa.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.083
I talked to Tim.

28:38.149 --> 28:39.451
{\an3}And I'm gonna take something
that belongs to you.

28:39.517 --> 28:41.086
Guy, what are you doing?

28:41.152 --> 28:42.187
Don't like how it feels?
Maybe you shouldn't have

28:42.253 --> 28:43.254
slept with my fiancé.

28:43.321 --> 28:45.023
{\an6}LEX:
Stop.

28:43.321 --> 28:45.023
I'm gonna keep this.

28:45.090 --> 28:46.057
No, you're not. Give me that.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.258
And this is not the place, Joey.

28:47.325 --> 28:49.060
Wait, you told him?

28:49.127 --> 28:50.361
{\an6}You knew?

28:49.127 --> 28:50.361
Wait...

28:50.428 --> 28:52.397
{\an5}You're just as evil as he is.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.397
Hey, watch how you talk to her.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.965
{\an1}Don't tell him
how to talk to me.

28:54.032 --> 28:55.233
I told you to stay out
of my way. I don't want

28:55.300 --> 28:57.001
to see you, and I don't want to
hear anything out of your mouth.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.303
{\an5}(Vega clears throat)

28:57.068 --> 28:58.303
What?

29:00.371 --> 29:01.739
We done?

29:04.142 --> 29:06.044
Out of my ER.

29:08.146 --> 29:09.280
Griff?

29:09.347 --> 29:10.982
Vega.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.183
Patient's in 7.

29:13.485 --> 29:16.521
Dr. Trulie, you know
I don't like drama.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.189
And since you got here,
I like it even less.

29:18.256 --> 29:21.092
(monitor beeping rapidly)

29:24.262 --> 29:25.530
We've repleted his electrolytes
and put him on an epi drip.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.065
Should we max it out?

29:27.132 --> 29:28.500
Nope. He's decompensating
too fast.

29:28.566 --> 29:31.169
We need to get him on
an LV assist device now.

29:31.236 --> 29:32.170
{\an1}Ma'am, we're gonna
take him up to surgery.

29:32.237 --> 29:33.338
{\an1}I'll be back
to talk to you soon.

29:33.404 --> 29:34.539
Okay?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.808
You, stay on the floor.

29:41.846 --> 29:44.315
He's in good hands.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.817
You know, of all the kids

29:45.884 --> 29:47.418
who've come into this ER
after a fall,

29:47.485 --> 29:50.221
{\an1}your brother's
the only one I've ever seen

29:50.288 --> 29:52.490
without so much
as a scraped knee.

29:52.557 --> 29:54.492
What are you saying?

29:54.559 --> 29:56.261
{\an1}I don't think
Brian fell.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.129
I don't think he was
skateboarding or running

29:58.196 --> 30:00.031
or climbing a fence.

30:00.098 --> 30:03.067
{\an1}I-I know you were trying
to look out for your brother,

30:03.134 --> 30:05.803
and I bet that's hard,
especially with your dad gone.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.805
But right now,

30:07.872 --> 30:09.407
if you really want to look out
for him, you need to tell me

30:09.474 --> 30:10.808
what actually happened.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.413
Cameron. Honey.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.448
What were you two doing?

30:21.319 --> 30:23.855
Joey, is my dad with you?

30:23.922 --> 30:25.290
He got called to the ER
for a consult?

30:25.356 --> 30:26.558
{\an1}Yes, and he stirred up
a bunch of trouble down there,

30:26.624 --> 30:28.059
for which I am being punished.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.194
Is he with you or not?

30:29.260 --> 30:30.562
Not. He's headed
for surgery with Vega.

30:30.628 --> 30:33.164
Okay, well, so are we.

30:33.231 --> 30:35.500
The tumor in Amy's heart
is blocking her tricuspid valve.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.502
{\an1}Since when? It grew
since she's been here?

30:37.569 --> 30:40.071
Yes, and it's gonna keep growing
unless we get it out of there.

30:40.138 --> 30:42.073
Will you tell them
to prep an OR, please?

30:42.140 --> 30:43.474
We need to move.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.377
Stop the epi drip.

30:46.444 --> 30:47.412
Go on.

30:47.478 --> 30:49.113
The boys were vaping.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.381
When Brian couldn't breathe,
his brother thought

30:50.448 --> 30:52.083
he was having
an allergic reaction.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.551
We gave him the epi,
but it didn't help.

30:53.618 --> 30:55.353
'Cause it wasn't an allergy.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.389
{\an1}Catecholaminergic polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.558
{\an5}It's a genetic condition.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.558
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.360
Vega's running tests to confirm.

31:02.427 --> 31:04.495
I think it's what
killed their father.

31:04.562 --> 31:05.630
Right, I'll put him
on a temporary assist device

31:05.697 --> 31:07.398
{\an5}till his heart recovers.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.398
{\an1}Okay.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.133
I'll let the mom know that we're
doing a different procedure.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.201
Uh, Lex.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.239
I blew it.

31:14.305 --> 31:15.873
What we had was good,

31:15.940 --> 31:17.308
and I blew it.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.477
You know what was good?

31:21.479 --> 31:24.382
What Sam and I had.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.184
That was good.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.453
Lex, I...

31:28.519 --> 31:31.656
I doubled down on us
and it cost me my best friend.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.591
{\an1}So, yeah.

31:33.658 --> 31:36.261
I'm the one who blew it.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.337
(whirring, beeping)

31:48.339 --> 31:49.607
SAM:
Ten blade.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.945
{\an5}(Sam grunts)

31:52.243 --> 31:53.945
CALEB: Oh.

31:55.613 --> 31:58.216
Let's get Tanya to her vineyard.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.919
Ooh, okay. There's the AV node.

32:01.986 --> 32:03.454
SAM:
Mm-hmm.

32:03.521 --> 32:04.622
We're almost there.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.658
{\an5}(rapid beeping)

32:04.689 --> 32:06.658
No, no, no, no.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.559
No, no. Long scissors to me.
Come on, Tanya.

32:08.626 --> 32:10.628
Stay with me.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.430
Her cardiac output is falling.

32:12.497 --> 32:14.265
{\an5}SAM:
Increase the pump
to six liters per minute.

32:14.332 --> 32:15.933
We can do this.

32:23.574 --> 32:25.243
{\an1}NURSE:
Hemoglobin dropping to 9.3.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.979
Infuse her with
two more units of PRBCs.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.614
I can't get the rest
of the tumor.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.582
Hey. It's not your fault.

32:31.649 --> 32:33.217
There's nothing left to do.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.485
Yes, there is.

32:34.552 --> 32:35.987
What, your dad's technique?

32:36.054 --> 32:37.655
He could never get it
to work in the SIM lab.

32:37.722 --> 32:40.224
I did. Couple times.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.359
You didn't tell me that.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.728
Just needed
a little modification.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.065
Get me 5cc's
of fibrin gel matrix.

32:50.268 --> 32:51.536
For ortho reconstruction?

32:51.602 --> 32:53.371
{\an1}Exactly.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.206
We'll freeze
the remaining tumor,

32:55.273 --> 32:57.475
and then reinforce
the healthy tissue around it.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.410
I'll use the gel matrix

32:59.477 --> 33:02.280
to create a connective tissue
scaffolding.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.215
Oh. Well, that's
a really good idea.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.351
Well, here's hoping it works.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.019
Have the cryoablation
catheter ready.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.688
More exposure, please.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.690
{\an5}There it is.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.690
CALEB: Mm.

33:16.294 --> 33:18.696
{\an3}I hear we have an
atrial myxoma resection.

33:18.763 --> 33:20.431
They're not resecting it.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.033
What are they doing?

33:22.100 --> 33:23.568
The Griffith technique.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.308
(water running)

33:31.843 --> 33:33.644
(spray dispensing)

33:36.581 --> 33:38.549
The remaining tumor
is neutralized.

33:38.616 --> 33:40.284
All the tissue is frozen.

33:40.351 --> 33:43.287
The surrounding structure
appears intact.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.789
Let's put it to the test.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.358
CALEB:
Taking her off pump.

33:48.659 --> 33:50.595
(machine clicks)

33:56.100 --> 33:57.802
{\an5}(heart beating)

33:56.100 --> 33:57.802
(monitor beeping)

33:57.869 --> 33:59.570
(gasps)

34:01.706 --> 34:02.774
{\an1}(exhales):
Oh...

34:02.840 --> 34:04.409
(Sam laughs)

34:04.475 --> 34:06.444
{\an3}CALEB:
It worked.

34:09.813 --> 34:11.516
{\an3}SAM:
Let's close her up.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.793
Whew. That was incredible.

34:22.860 --> 34:23.828
You were incredible.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.464
{\an5}Fibrin gel reinforcement?

34:23.895 --> 34:26.464
{\an1}Yeah.

34:26.531 --> 34:27.665
{\an5}That's brilliant.

34:26.531 --> 34:27.665
{\an3}(laughs)

34:27.732 --> 34:28.800
What made you think of that?

34:28.866 --> 34:30.802
It was just an idea that I had.

34:30.868 --> 34:33.070
And I was tired
of waiting for my dad

34:33.137 --> 34:34.539
to come up with something.

34:34.605 --> 34:36.407
I was tired of being a pin.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.476
(chuckles) It's-it's this thing
that Malcolm said.

34:39.543 --> 34:42.679
I need to change things instead
of waiting for them to change.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.549
{\an5}Malcolm said that, huh?

34:42.746 --> 34:44.549
{\an3}Yeah.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.851
I also think that this might
help with my mom's case.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.619
You know? Like...

34:48.686 --> 34:51.489
good press would be a feather
in the cap of an interim CMO.

34:51.556 --> 34:54.759
I wonder if Rhonda would support
her appeal in return.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.828
Yeah, sounds like
a good deal to me.

34:56.893 --> 34:59.430
{\an3}Yeah, I mean, you know, press is
normally more my dad's speed,

34:59.497 --> 35:01.566
{\an3}but, like, I could make
an exception for her.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.470
{\an5}What's wrong?

35:03.601 --> 35:05.470
{\an1}Nothing.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.738
Um, but when you're done
with your press and the fanfare,

35:07.805 --> 35:09.373
I just need a letter
of recommendation,

35:09.440 --> 35:10.675
for the Boston job.

35:10.741 --> 35:12.877
{\an3}Wow. Right.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.647
So, you're going
if you get the job.

35:16.714 --> 35:18.149
If I get the job.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.750
And even if you don't,

35:19.817 --> 35:21.652
we're not...

35:21.719 --> 35:24.655
I mean, "we're done"
is what you're saying.

35:24.722 --> 35:28.493
I need to change things instead
of waiting for them to change.

35:29.494 --> 35:30.661
Just like Malcolm said.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.182
{\an5}Schedule's out.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.182
{\an1}Hmm?

35:51.249 --> 35:52.250
{\an1}Hmm.

35:59.557 --> 36:02.226
{\an1}That was not my drama
you saw today.

36:02.293 --> 36:04.529
But since we're sharing,

36:04.595 --> 36:05.930
my personal life
did take a hit today.

36:05.997 --> 36:09.166
{\an1}A big one.
But I kept it in check.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.701
And if you had any idea
how hard that was,

36:10.768 --> 36:12.203
you might appreciate
that I still gave it

36:12.270 --> 36:14.205
everything I had today.

36:14.272 --> 36:16.574
Now, that might not
make you like me,

36:16.641 --> 36:18.576
{\an1}but at least you wouldn't
put me back on nights.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.444
Whose drama was it?

36:20.511 --> 36:22.179
I speak for myself.

36:22.246 --> 36:24.916
Other peoples' personal lives
are their business.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.953
{\an5}You prefer days.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.953
{\an1}Yes.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.454
{\an5}(keyboard clicking)

36:29.020 --> 36:30.454
Weekdays?

36:30.521 --> 36:32.823
Ideally.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.727
Dr. Kace can have nights.

36:36.794 --> 36:37.962
{\an1}Okay.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.730
Thank you.

36:46.904 --> 36:47.972
Pyne.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.575
{\an3}(exhales)
Look,

36:50.641 --> 36:53.744
I didn't mean to interfere
with your marriage.

36:53.811 --> 36:55.846
Then you shouldn't have
slept with my wife.

36:55.913 --> 36:57.982
See, I have spent

36:58.049 --> 36:59.884
enough time with you lately
to know what's behind

36:59.951 --> 37:01.652
your bloviating and bravado.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.589
{\an1}People look at you
and they see many things.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.591
A renowned surgeon.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.626
Pathological narcissist.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.294
Womanizer.

37:10.361 --> 37:13.497
But I know the truth.

37:13.564 --> 37:18.669
I know that what you really are
is a petty, weak, insecure

37:18.736 --> 37:21.973
{\an1}little man clinging onto things
he has already lost.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.843
And everyone knows it but him.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.982
(door opens)

37:33.985 --> 37:35.720
(exhales)

37:39.056 --> 37:40.658
{\an3}Hmm.

37:39.056 --> 37:40.658
{\an1}Oh.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.829
(clears throat)

37:44.895 --> 37:48.265
{\an1}Successful cryoablation
on an atrial myxoma.

37:48.332 --> 37:49.734
That's one for the books.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.968
(laughs softly)

37:51.035 --> 37:52.937
One for the medical journals,
anyway.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.939
Rhonda wants me
to do interviews,

37:55.006 --> 37:57.041
{\an3}so I am gonna talk
about the procedure,

37:57.108 --> 37:58.676
and she is gonna talk
to the board about Mom.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.745
My procedure.

38:00.811 --> 38:04.281
Your procedure repeatedly killed
a virtual patient.

38:04.348 --> 38:06.584
Mine saved an
actual life.

38:06.651 --> 38:08.819
You're not really gonna turn
this into a turf war, are you?

38:08.886 --> 38:09.854
You're not really gonna
take credit

38:09.920 --> 38:11.422
for my technique, are you?

38:11.489 --> 38:13.290
I performed the surgery.

38:13.357 --> 38:15.359
Which you could never have done
had I not first...

38:15.426 --> 38:17.962
Excuse me, fibrin gel
reinforcement was my idea.

38:18.029 --> 38:21.966
So you're going to steal my
technique like you stole my job.

38:22.033 --> 38:25.069
{\an3}It is never gonna
change, is it?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.471
{\an3}(laughs) We will
just keep doing this,

38:27.538 --> 38:30.941
and things are never going to
change unless I change them.

38:31.008 --> 38:33.077
I'm taking the department back.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.379
{\an4}It's all yours
for the next week.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.379
{\an3}No.

38:35.446 --> 38:38.382
I am taking it
back for good.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.884
(elevator doors open)

38:43.954 --> 38:47.425
Hey, I heard you got Rhonda
to talk to the board.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.093
I'm ready to be the ball.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.829
{\an1}Oh, really?
What are you gonna do?

38:51.896 --> 38:53.097
I'm gonna be the chief.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.399
And you're gonna
be on the board.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.768
And things are gonna
change around here.

38:58.903 --> 39:00.438
I like the sound of that.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.074
Then let's do it.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.509
Let's do things differently.

39:05.576 --> 39:07.812
I'm in.

39:19.857 --> 39:22.126
{\an5}Sam.

39:19.857 --> 39:22.126
{\an3}I can't stand
the thought of you

39:22.193 --> 39:24.729
going through a breakup alone.

39:24.795 --> 39:27.031
(sighs)

39:27.098 --> 39:29.100
{\an1}How are we supposed
to talk about it?

39:30.501 --> 39:33.437
Uh-- How do we talk about him?

39:33.504 --> 39:35.906
I think we call him Barry.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.042
Barry.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.042
{\an3}Yeah,

39:38.109 --> 39:40.511
'cause we can talk about Barry.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.414
I'm so sorry, Sam.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.385
How could I let Barry
ruin our friendship?

39:49.887 --> 39:52.156
He didn't ruin our friendship.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.557
He helped it.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.427
{\an3}Lex, there were
all sorts of things

39:56.494 --> 39:58.028
we never would've talked
about if it wasn't for...

39:58.095 --> 39:59.964
Barry.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.932
Things that needed to be fixed.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.502
So our friendship isn't ruined.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.470
It's getting better.

40:07.538 --> 40:10.007
Yeah. It is.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.809
{\an1}Barry is still
a jackass, though.

40:11.876 --> 40:13.477
Oh, yeah, he is the worst.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.579
{\an1}The worst.

40:15.646 --> 40:17.782
Do you want to get those braids
out and talk about it?

40:17.848 --> 40:20.584
{\an5}Can we sip on some wine first?

40:17.848 --> 40:20.584
{\an3}(laughs):
Yeah.

40:20.651 --> 40:22.419
SAM:
<i>You always go in with a plan.</i>

40:24.021 --> 40:26.590

<i>So then you have</i>
<i>to change the plan.</i>

40:33.063 --> 40:35.933
<i>Maybe you have to make</i>
<i>a whole new one.</i>

40:42.239 --> 40:44.441
{\an3}I still don't
know what to do.

40:45.409 --> 40:47.545
You said if I told you
that it would help.

40:54.185 --> 40:57.221
{\an1}(exhales)
Lex was right.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.190
{\an1}Knowing who it is
doesn't help.

40:59.256 --> 41:01.625
I'm still so angry.
