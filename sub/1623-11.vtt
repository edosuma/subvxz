23:02.715 --> 23:03.750
If I could.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.003
Think you're ready?

23:07.970 --> 23:10.803
Ready, Freddie. I'm...

23:10.931 --> 23:12.922
I'm ready as I'll ever be.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.224
The coast is clear, so...
"Let my people go."

23:20.900 --> 23:23.186
No... no more voices. No, just one.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.976
Just mine.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.104
I'm all better now.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.572
Better?

23:38.042 --> 23:39.373
I didn't kill those people.

23:39.501 --> 23:43.540
They were good people, your people.
I would never, ever do that.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.755
- You sure?
- Yes.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.671
Cos I've been going at this a long time,
in and out of these places,

23:49.845 --> 23:51.551
with your mother, and now you.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.545
I'm not like Mom.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.555
No, she was sick. She turned on you.
I would never do that.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.231
I kept your secrets.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.772
The Night Room?

24:06.946 --> 24:09.779
Locked away. I didn't tell.
I'd never tell.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.280
Secrets, Jennifer...

24:17.665 --> 24:20.281
...are something never said out loud.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.292
Not even here.

24:24.421 --> 24:25.922
Not even with me!

24:27.299 --> 24:28.505
You understand?

24:30.511 --> 24:33.344
Yes. Sorry.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.595
OK.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.276
I think it's best
you're here for the time being.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.489
No.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.324
Best for who? Best for who?

24:58.580 --> 24:59.615
Best for who?

25:00.457 --> 25:02.948
Daddy... Daddy!

25:05.671 --> 25:07.457
I'm your daughter! No!

25:09.925 --> 25:13.417
Want to move the cultivated samples
of M-510 to another location.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.211
I think the Night Room is vulnerable.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.340
Call Peters.
Maybe he'll take that CIA deal.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.636
Uh, about Jennifer...

25:20.769 --> 25:23.602
The security footage clearly
shows she didn't kill those...

25:23.731 --> 25:27.565
Jennifer is exactly
where she needs to be.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.896
- Am I clear?
- Absolutely.

26:13.822 --> 26:19.317
I remember meeting you in 1987,
28 years ago.

26:21.163 --> 26:25.122
And you looked exactly the same
as you do today.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.515
Leland Goines has been murdered.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.057
We received a call
from the mental institution.

26:44.186 --> 26:47.394
Jennifer Goines
is talking about the Night Room.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.184
I believe this means we can pursue.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.190
Jennifer gave us
the location of the Night Room,

27:00.327 --> 27:04.411
but the origin of the virus
was destroyed by James Cole.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.663
Why would you allow us
to be set up for failure?

27:10.796 --> 27:14.084
The period of interference
must be maintained.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.210
There's something you're not telling me.

27:26.103 --> 27:29.345
This cycle must happen
exactly as it has,

27:29.481 --> 27:31.972
otherwise the traveler
will have never come.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.187
We must maintain it.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.187
The virus was lost to us in Chechnya.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.190
It's time to move on to Oliver Peters.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.112
He will re-create it for us.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.705
(GROANS)

28:02.055 --> 28:04.262
The virus, where is it?

28:05.100 --> 28:06.601
Aaron Marker.

28:08.228 --> 28:13.188
Dr Railly is very important...
to us, and to you.

28:13.317 --> 28:18.437
So tell me, what are you willing to do
to keep her alive?

28:29.458 --> 28:31.289
Marker won't be a problem.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.625
My bigger concern is Dr Railly.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.752
You can't kill her.

28:39.885 --> 28:43.719
If she doesn't leave that message
during the plague...

28:45.432 --> 28:47.138
...Cole won't make it back here.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.308
Neither will I.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.723
We should talk about James Cole.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.394
- He's not a concern.
- How can you be so sure?

28:56.526 --> 29:00.735
I killed him... in '87.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.697
That was his lastjump.

29:06.578 --> 29:11.197
You have a working virus now.
It's over.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.823
What's next?

29:16.713 --> 29:20.456
The plague... and the coming of the 12.

29:25.806 --> 29:32.097
Sources are now saying Senator William
Royce will run for president in 2016.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.263
Insiders were tipped off earlier today
when news broke

29:35.440 --> 29:38.398
claiming Royce had released
some of his senatorial staff

29:38.568 --> 29:41.355
to focus solely
on a new campaign committee,

29:41.488 --> 29:43.228
although official confirmation

29:43.365 --> 29:45.401
and a press conference
have yet to be announced.

29:45.534 --> 29:49.197
This news comes as little surprise
to pundits on Capitol Hill.

29:49.329 --> 29:52.787
Hey. I've been trying
to call you all day.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.623
Mmm. Battery's dead.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.208
I've been watching the news.

29:58.588 --> 30:02.831
Yeah, yeah. Big, big story, huh?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.131
- You're drunk.
-Hmm?

30:07.264 --> 30:09.505
Shouldn't you be somewhere with Royce?

30:09.641 --> 30:12.018
Uh, no.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.176
No, I'm not working
for the Senator any more.

30:15.397 --> 30:22.519
I have been vetted, and... found to be
unsuitable for the future campaign.

30:22.654 --> 30:28.650
Chechnya, Troy... you.
(CHUCKLES)

30:28.785 --> 30:32.619
I have too much baggage for him
to carry over into the primaries.

30:32.748 --> 30:36.787
- Aaron, no, I am so...
- Mm-mmm, mm-mmm, no, no.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.997
No, there's nothing to be sorry about.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.710
Look, you know, I know. Huh?

30:45.552 --> 30:47.213
None of this matters.

30:47.387 --> 30:51.972
Anyway, Royce is a dead man.
They're all dead men.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.681
Right? But we...

30:54.895 --> 30:59.605
...we have a chance, OK?
Insider information.

30:59.733 --> 31:00.768
Right?

31:00.942 --> 31:05.185
Look, we can be prepared for it,
and we can ride it out, survive it.

31:05.322 --> 31:10.032
Look, shelters, places
way out in the middle of nowhere,

31:10.202 --> 31:11.942
where we could... we can hide.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.569
OK, stop, Aaron.

31:13.705 --> 31:14.820
- What?
- Stop.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.867
Cassie, I'm not gonna let you die here.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.036
But this isn't over yet.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.701
There's still hope.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.711
What hope?

31:25.425 --> 31:26.835
Cole?

31:32.557 --> 31:33.967
Cole?

31:37.145 --> 31:39.887
When is the last time
that you've even seen Cole?

31:40.023 --> 31:41.638
Huh?

31:41.775 --> 31:44.642
How do you know
that he's not somewhere else?

31:44.778 --> 31:45.813
Dead.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.732
Yeah.

31:47.864 --> 31:51.197
You know what's coming, Cassie!

31:51.326 --> 31:53.282
How can you tell me
not to do anything?

31:53.412 --> 31:55.403
How can you burden me with this

31:55.539 --> 31:58.326
and expect me to just sit
on my goddamn hands, Cassie?

31:58.458 --> 32:00.119
- OK, listen to me. Listen to me.
- No.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.621
Listen, what you need to do
is go back to Royce.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.540
- No.
- Yes. Stay on him.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.335
Convince him
that something needs to be done.

32:07.467 --> 32:08.502
We can'tjust run.

32:09.136 --> 32:11.172
People need to know.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.340
Look, Marker,
I feel terrible about this.

32:17.477 --> 32:21.436
Wexler, Chechnya,
they are gonna be so up my ass

32:21.565 --> 32:23.305
come election time over that fiasco.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.477
I understand.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.476
You'll still have access to the offices,
in the meantime.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.022
I'm sure you'll land on your feet.

32:29.156 --> 32:32.944
Sir, I was wondering about the private
sector project you were working on,

32:33.076 --> 32:36.068
the selective survival protocol
in the event of a widespread disaster.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.662
Well, that's just
in the think tank stage right now.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.032
It could be interesting
for someone of your concerns.

32:42.169 --> 32:44.751
I tell you what, the investor is
on their way over here right now,

32:44.880 --> 32:49.044
and they're looking for someone
to spearhead the project.

33:06.735 --> 33:11.900
I know what's happening here.
You climb the steps, ring the bell.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.444
- What happened to her?
- She got out again.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.409
Found her living on the streets,
hiding behind a dumpster like a dog.

33:17.579 --> 33:20.446
Oh, my God.
"Hiding behind a dumpster like a dog."

33:21.208 --> 33:22.618
Ow!

33:23.835 --> 33:25.826
(DOOR LOCKING)

33:27.047 --> 33:28.207
Hey!

33:28.340 --> 33:30.126
Hey, let me out!

33:59.454 --> 34:02.412
Hello, Jennifer.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.997
How was your bath?

34:07.212 --> 34:10.500
I've wanted to meet you for some time.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.090
I knew your father.

34:15.303 --> 34:18.261
My company contributed
to his research many years ago.

34:21.685 --> 34:22.845
May I?

34:33.697 --> 34:36.109
Did he ever tell you
how much he loved you?

34:45.417 --> 34:46.907
My father was the same.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.838
He had plans for me.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.752
There was a thing in a box...

35:00.181 --> 35:02.923
...with printed instructions.

35:03.893 --> 35:07.431
Difficult... problematic.

35:13.903 --> 35:17.771
We know you didn't kill those
people at Markridge, Jennifer.

35:17.907 --> 35:21.570
We have proof... security footage.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.070
No more running.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.579
Did you ever know
your mother, Jennifer?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.331
They took her away, didn't they?

35:37.594 --> 35:39.050
Along time ago.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.963
Your father abandoned her, too.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.560
Locked her away
till she went to sleep.

35:53.568 --> 35:57.561
No one was left to protect you.
I can protect you now.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.566
You can be a daughter again.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.999
I want to be a daughter again.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.301
Yeah.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.133
Shh.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.811
What is she telling her in there?

36:28.937 --> 36:32.020
Oh, she's... securing your future.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.859
I thought my future was my own.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.899
Of course. It is.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.322
(BUZZER)

36:52.001 --> 36:54.378
No! No, we can't lose him!

36:57.966 --> 36:59.752
(GROANS)

37:01.386 --> 37:03.001
Wait. That's odd.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.003
His vitals, they...

37:05.140 --> 37:07.756
It's... it's as if he's...

37:07.934 --> 37:09.265
Dying.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.807
Do something with this one.

37:16.693 --> 37:17.899
Everyone out!

37:19.070 --> 37:21.356
JONES: Slingshot Mr Cole to 2015.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.358
MAN: Clear the room!

37:22.574 --> 37:28.661
2015? With this much power
and a signal so weak...

37:29.414 --> 37:32.497
...we could overload the tether.
It might break.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.623
We could lose him forever.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.994
We have to!

37:40.717 --> 37:42.423
JONES: This is not a predict.

37:55.231 --> 38:01.318
Resetting coordinates,
sending Mr Cole to 2015.

38:03.990 --> 38:08.279
Initiating splinter sequence... now.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.661
Good luck, James.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.761
WHITLEY: Jones...

38:28.890 --> 38:31.973
Not now, Mr Whitley.

38:33.728 --> 38:37.812
- I think we should have a drink.
- You don't drink.

38:37.941 --> 38:43.152
I told you that if I did,
it'd be with you.

38:49.536 --> 38:54.701
So... this is good bye?

38:57.418 --> 38:59.545
We lost the tether.

39:00.922 --> 39:05.165
Cole's gone. The mission is over.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.588
The mission is temporarily...

39:08.763 --> 39:10.128
It's over.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.551
Spearhead...

39:12.725 --> 39:15.967
Ramse... now Cole.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.431
We don't have enough men
to secure this facility.

39:21.901 --> 39:25.985
We're vulnerable to the next group
that passes by, no matter how small.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.946
There's word of a city
just west of here.

39:29.617 --> 39:34.031
There's nothing out there, Marcus,
and never will be.

39:34.831 --> 39:38.870
Nothing here, except a ticking clock.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.788
We have the machine!

39:43.381 --> 39:45.042
I am the clock.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.880
I left my father for you.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.973
I killed for you.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.945
I believed in you.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.259
Did you ever have children?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.969
A son.

40:37.101 --> 40:41.765
He succumbed... in 2017.

40:41.898 --> 40:45.106
The greatest lie is believing
that we are shaping them,

40:45.234 --> 40:48.271
that we have any control.

40:50.531 --> 40:53.523
No. They make us.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.865
They can destroy us.

41:00.875 --> 41:06.666
What's left for us now, Katarina?
What options do we have?

41:08.132 --> 41:11.295
I'm incapable of abandoning this place.

41:12.512 --> 41:14.594
There are no other options for me.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.176
Even if there's no hope?

41:19.227 --> 41:21.809
Even if it means
knowing you will die here?

41:21.938 --> 41:23.474
Hope? (CHUCKLES)

41:28.069 --> 41:31.402
Hope is the luxury of those
who are unburdened by fate.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.401
My last breath will be here.

42:20.955 --> 42:23.071
Cole? What happened?

42:25.084 --> 42:27.621
They've been one step ahead of us
the whole way.

42:27.754 --> 42:30.211
- Now I know why.
- How?

42:33.968 --> 42:36.425
I know who the Witness is.
