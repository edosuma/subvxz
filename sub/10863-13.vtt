00:29.880 --> 00:31.480
Uh... heights.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.760
I'm not good with heights.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.080
I, uh, I get sick.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.800
Dogs.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
I was bitten 
 when I was a kid.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.840
Any time I see one, 
 I cross the street.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.520
Birds.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.960
Birds?

00:48.960 --> 00:51.720
I'm afraid they're gonna 
 fly in my face or something.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.160
Weird.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.800
The attic.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.320
I can't go up there 
 alone.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.400
No way.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.840
Slasher movies!

01:02.840 --> 01:03.920
That doesn't count.

01:03.920 --> 01:04.920
Cheap.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.400
What can I say?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.560
I'm not afraid 
 of anything.

01:08.560 --> 01:09.680
Yeah. We'll see.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.640
So what are you 
 afraid of, tough guy?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.360
That box?

01:17.800 --> 01:19.840
It's no secret.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.320
I'm afraid of the dark.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.160
Yes! 
 He admits it!

01:26.600 --> 01:29.080
We've all got something 
 that scares us

01:29.080 --> 01:30.600
even though it shouldn't.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.320
You know there's nothing 
 in the attic that can get you.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.560
You know a bird 
 can't hurt you.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.240
But there's still 
 some dark place inside

01:38.240 --> 01:40.240
that makes 
 your hands sweat...

01:40.240 --> 01:41.960
And your mouth go dry.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.080
My story's about fear,

01:45.080 --> 01:47.600
the kind that's different 
 for everyone,

01:47.600 --> 01:50.760
that kind that you 
 have to face up to...

01:50.760 --> 01:52.480
Or it'll eat you alive.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.240
Submitted for the approval

01:56.240 --> 01:59.040
of the Midnight Society,

01:59.040 --> 02:00.640
I call this story...

02:02.280 --> 02:05.360
The Tale of the Dangerous Soup.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.840
Hello?

02:15.840 --> 02:16.760
Hey...

02:16.760 --> 02:18.680
I can't get 
 out of here.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.480
[Man]
 Sit down, please.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.720
Yeah, OK

02:25.720 --> 02:27.360
I'll bite.

02:30.760 --> 02:31.720
Great.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.720
Now what?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.200
[Clank]

02:36.520 --> 02:39.400
[Man] It knows 
 what scares you.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.000
Hey, c-come on!

02:43.000 --> 02:46.480
It knows 
 what scares you!

02:46.480 --> 02:49.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

02:49.560 --> 02:52.320
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

02:55.160 --> 02:55.880
No!

02:56.600 --> 02:58.320
No! No!

02:59.760 --> 03:01.640
Hello. Welcome to 
 the Wild Boar.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.280
Your table's ready.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.640
It's fabulous!

03:12.640 --> 03:14.640
He's outdone 
 himself.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.760
[Man] This is the best 
 soup I've ever had.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.000
<i> Bon appetit.</i>

03:23.200 --> 03:23.960
Hi.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.160
We have specials tonight.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.040
Don't bother. 
 We came for the soup.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.200
Oh.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.040
What a surprise.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.640
2 soups. 
 Table 6.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.400
Hi.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.160
100 bucks for 
 a bowl of soup.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.160
If I had that 
 kind of cash,

03:48.160 --> 03:51.160
I would not be spending 
 it on a bowl of soup.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.440
They say 
 it's worth it.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.480
I'm sorry, 
 but no soup is worth it.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.680
Sorry, Jersey.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.680
[Yelling] You wanna 
 watch it with that stuff?

04:00.680 --> 04:02.080
Relax. It's OK.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.600
I'm not 
 picking those up.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.280
I don't touch knives, 
 OK? I'm sorry.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.600
Jersey, 
 what are you doing?

04:13.600 --> 04:15.600
I just want 
 another taste.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.160
You'll get fired 
 for that. Come on.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.120
Could we order a 
 second serving now?

04:26.120 --> 04:27.920
Sorry. One per customer.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.080
[Applause]

04:33.520 --> 04:35.440
Bravo! 
 Bravo!

04:35.440 --> 04:37.120
Honored guests,

04:37.120 --> 04:41.360
your admiration 
 of my humble fare...

04:41.360 --> 04:43.280
Is most appreciated.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.120
I'm looking for 
 the Wild...Boar?

05:06.120 --> 05:08.360
You found it. 
 You here about the job?

05:08.360 --> 05:09.480
Yeah.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.920
Great.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.040
I'm Nonnie Walker, hostess 
 and part-time bookkeeper.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.040
Reed.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.640
Reed Hanson.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.440
So... did you ever work 
 in a restaurant before?

05:23.440 --> 05:26.480
I've had a lot of 
 jobs.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.040
So what's this 
 place like?

05:28.040 --> 05:29.560
It's OK. Ha.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.920
Dr. Vink is kinda--

05:30.920 --> 05:32.200
Dr. Fink?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.680
Vink, with a Va-Va-Va.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.640
He's the boss. 
 He does everything--

05:36.640 --> 05:38.160
the menu, the--

05:38.160 --> 05:41.200
So what is he? Is he a 
 doctor, or is he a cook?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.840
To those Sage enough 
 to know,

05:43.840 --> 05:45.400
I am a chef.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.400
A cook feeds 
 the stomach.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.080
A chef...

05:50.080 --> 05:52.480
Nourishes the Soul.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.800
So what, am I supposed to 
 be impressed or something?

06:00.120 --> 06:01.280
Interesting.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.400
<i> You may do.</i>

06:05.440 --> 06:06.520
Come.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.080
Looks like a nutbag 
 to me.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.000
A chef is an artist.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
The kitchen 
 is his studio,

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
and these...Vegetables, 
 fruits, spices...

06:30.000 --> 06:32.320
These are his medium.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.280
[Inhales]

06:38.280 --> 06:41.520
Combined by the seasoned 
 hand of an epicure,

06:41.520 --> 06:45.200
the result is a feast 
 for the senses.

06:46.960 --> 06:47.960
Taste.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.560
[Sniffs]

06:51.560 --> 06:52.960
What is it?

06:52.960 --> 06:56.040
<i>Specialty of the house. 
 Le Potage Dangereux.</i>

06:56.040 --> 06:57.760
The Dangerous Soup.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.800
Taste.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.960
That's pretty good!

07:08.960 --> 07:10.440
My friend,

07:10.440 --> 07:12.960
the flavor dances 
 over the palette

07:12.960 --> 07:14.960
in a symphony 
 of sensation!

07:14.960 --> 07:16.560
It's far from 
 pretty good.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.520
And he charges 
 $100 a bowl.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.720
Get outta here!

07:19.720 --> 07:23.040
A small price to pay 
 for the sublime.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.840
Wait, let me have 
 another taste?

07:24.840 --> 07:27.000
One taste...

07:27.000 --> 07:29.480
To educate the palette.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.440
Try to sneak another,

07:34.440 --> 07:36.960
and I guarantee...

07:36.960 --> 07:38.600
You'll regret it.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.480
You don't scare me.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.880
Perfect!

07:44.880 --> 07:46.880
You'll do nicely.

07:49.040 --> 07:49.760
And...

07:51.040 --> 07:53.440
<i>I am not a nutbag.</i>

08:00.520 --> 08:02.400
<i> Reed needed this job 
 pretty bad.</i>

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
<i> He didn't have 
 any family,</i>

08:04.400 --> 08:06.920
<i> so he was pretty much 
 on his own.</i>

08:06.920 --> 08:08.400
<i> He mostly kept to himself,</i>

08:08.400 --> 08:10.920
<i> and never let anyone 
 help him do anything...</i>

08:10.920 --> 08:12.400
No. That's OK.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.560
<i> Ever.</i>

08:15.960 --> 08:18.400
<i> It was an OK. Place 
 to work,</i>

08:18.400 --> 08:20.920
<i> except every 
 once in a while,</i>

08:20.920 --> 08:22.400
<i> somebody would just quit.</i>

08:22.400 --> 08:23.920
<i> For no reason,</i>

08:23.920 --> 08:27.920
<i> they'd suddenly take off 
 and never look back.</i>

08:27.920 --> 08:29.600
<i> Strange.</i>

08:29.600 --> 08:33.600
<i> But Dr. Vink's restaurant 
 was the most popular in town.</i>

08:33.600 --> 08:35.600
<i> People came from all over</i>

08:35.600 --> 08:37.919
<i> just to sample 
 the Dangerous Soup.</i>

08:40.960 --> 08:42.919
I'm outta here. 
 See you tomorrow.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.200
Later.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.400
<i>Man, this is good.</i>

09:06.400 --> 09:08.200
What are you doing?

09:10.640 --> 09:13.840
Did you taste 
 my soup?

09:13.840 --> 09:14.840
No.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.360
He didn't.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.800
He...

09:17.800 --> 09:20.240
He was just 
 cleaning the stove.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.440
Dr. Vink?

09:21.440 --> 09:23.360
No way!

09:23.360 --> 09:24.840
I don't do 
 dishes!

09:24.840 --> 09:26.920
I wait 
 tables!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.440
So you've told me.

09:30.440 --> 09:34.000
Alas, my dear, your job 
 description has just been changed.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.360
Nonnie.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.360
Thank you.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.880
Forget it.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.160
Wait!

09:46.080 --> 09:48.000
I mean for 
 everything.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.360
You've been really cool 
 to me since I got here,

09:51.360 --> 09:54.360
and, um... 
 I've been...

09:54.360 --> 09:57.360
I've been kind of 
 a... slug.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.520
Yeah, I noticed.

09:59.520 --> 10:03.560
My dear, you have 
 proven to be far too...

10:03.560 --> 10:06.720
<i> Loud for the tastes 
 of my guests.</i>

10:08.440 --> 10:09.680
Loud?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.280
Loud?!

10:13.920 --> 10:16.160
I'll show you loud!

10:18.040 --> 10:18.960
This...

10:18.960 --> 10:20.480
What's going on?

10:20.480 --> 10:22.520
No, no, wait, 
 wait, please.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.000
I finally got the guts 
 to say this to you, so...

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I have always 
 had to do things

10:29.000 --> 10:30.920
on my own.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.160
And I'm not used 
 to people being...

10:35.160 --> 10:36.960
Very nice to me.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.880
And, um...

10:38.880 --> 10:40.880
I'm sorry.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.400
Please... please, 
 my dear!

10:46.400 --> 10:49.880
You misunderstand!

10:49.880 --> 10:52.400
[Chuckles]

10:52.400 --> 10:55.880
By transferring you 
 to the kitchen,

10:55.880 --> 10:59.880
I was planning on 
 making you my protege.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.320
You're kidding.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.800
Indeed not!

11:02.800 --> 11:05.800
The secret ingredient 
 of my soup

11:05.800 --> 11:09.320
is known to only 
 a select few.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.320
<i>And you-- 
 you, my dear--</i>

11:12.320 --> 11:16.840
have been chosen to join the 
 ranks of the enlightened!

11:16.840 --> 11:20.040
If you're interested.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.400
Really?

11:24.400 --> 11:26.320
There's nothing 
 in that freezer.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.320
I'll show you. 
 My secret lies within,

11:29.320 --> 11:32.320
and it's yours 
 to experience.

11:43.080 --> 11:43.800
[Thud]

11:45.080 --> 11:47.400
What's going on?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.600
Sit down, please.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.880
<i>What is this?</i>

11:54.880 --> 11:56.360
You want my secret?

11:56.360 --> 11:58.240
Sit down, please.

12:00.560 --> 12:04.160
Ha. Man, you are 
 the strangest.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.120
It knows 
 what scares you.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.160
Vink!

12:40.400 --> 12:41.800
[Chuckles]

12:47.720 --> 12:49.640
It knows what scares you!

12:49.640 --> 12:51.080
Jersey: Aah!

12:51.080 --> 12:52.800
Aah!

12:52.800 --> 12:54.240
Ha ha ha ha ha!

12:57.240 --> 12:58.200
[Gasps]

12:58.200 --> 12:59.680
What are you doing?

12:59.680 --> 13:02.080
No. You--you--you

13:02.080 --> 13:03.600
can't.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.280
Open the door now.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.800
Very well.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.480
Open it.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.120
Are you OK?

13:19.120 --> 13:20.520
Yeah.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.520
What happened?

13:22.520 --> 13:25.040
Well--you were 
 screaming.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.040
I was?

13:26.040 --> 13:27.160
Yeah.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.520
Man, it's like 
 I blanked or something.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.520
I gotta get 
 outta here.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.680
Jersey.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.960
What is going on?

13:36.960 --> 13:39.520
You'd better start 
 talkin', pal.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.520
You intrigue me, 
 lad.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.000
You're not like 
 the others.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.040
I believe it's time

13:46.040 --> 13:49.040
to share the secret 
 of my soup.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.040
Perhaps it will 
 help to explain

13:51.040 --> 13:53.280
what you've just 
 witnessed.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.360
During my travels,

13:56.360 --> 13:59.520
I once happened upon a 
 tribe of savage warriors

13:59.520 --> 14:02.520
who never raised 
 a sword in anger,

14:02.520 --> 14:06.520
for they had a weapon 
 far more powerful...

14:06.520 --> 14:09.560
A statue, 
 a talisman,

14:09.560 --> 14:12.560
enchanted with 
 an incredible power.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.960
This magic statue 
 actually had the power

14:17.960 --> 14:20.560
to feed on fear.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.960
What?

14:21.960 --> 14:22.960
Oh, yes.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.480
It could reach 
 into your mind

14:25.480 --> 14:27.480
and actually create...

14:27.480 --> 14:29.960
Your deepest fear.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.960
It was only an illusion,

14:31.960 --> 14:34.640
but the more 
 you believed in it,

14:34.640 --> 14:36.680
the more real 
 it would become.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.640
What's this got to 
 do with your soup?

14:39.640 --> 14:43.480
This talisman not only 
 summoned fear from its enemies,

14:43.480 --> 14:45.480
it drew it from them

14:45.480 --> 14:47.480
like a precious elixir.

14:47.480 --> 14:51.240
The tribe would drink 
 the fear of its enemies

14:51.240 --> 14:52.880
to gain their strength.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.320
A single drop

14:56.320 --> 15:00.480
is enough to make the pulse 
 quicken and the blood flow.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.480
When you taste my soup, 
 you're tasting fear,

15:03.480 --> 15:06.840
and that's a taste 
 you won't soon forget.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.480
That's why everyone 
 quits.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.480
You've been scaring them 
 to get the ingredient.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.480
Wait a minute. You don't 
 believe all this, do you?

15:14.480 --> 15:18.680
You're quite the 
 tough one, aren't you?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.440
I told you before.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.080
You don't scare me.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.080
Then let's see what does.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.680
Shall we?

15:30.480 --> 15:32.480
Let's get 
 outta here, OK?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.720
What's the problem, lad?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.720
No longer feeling brave?

15:43.640 --> 15:45.440
Come on.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.560
No.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.160
Someone's gotta 
 stand up to this guy.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.920
Observe, my dear.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.520
This should be 
 interesting.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.600
[Slam]

16:09.600 --> 16:11.440
It knows...

16:11.440 --> 16:13.840
What scares you.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.440
Sorry, Vink,

16:16.440 --> 16:19.440
you're not gonna 
 get to me that easily.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.360
That's what I'm 
 counting on.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.880
The stronger 
 the subject,

16:22.880 --> 16:25.000
the more powerful 
 the elixir.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.160
Hmm...

16:28.160 --> 16:30.880
What have we here?

16:30.880 --> 16:34.440
What lies deep inside?

16:35.560 --> 16:39.800
I'm seeing 
 a scared little boy,

16:39.800 --> 16:40.880
an orphan...

16:40.880 --> 16:42.600
I'm not buying this.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.400
...raised by an uncle.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.720
He was a cruel man

16:48.720 --> 16:52.760
who treated you 
 very harshly.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.240
What happened to him, lad?

16:57.640 --> 16:58.360
Yes...

16:59.960 --> 17:02.840
You remember now, 
 don't you?

17:07.760 --> 17:10.119
How--how did you do that?

17:10.119 --> 17:11.640
Have a look.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.400
Stop it. 
 Let him out.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.560
I know you can't 
 resist.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.000
Aah! Aah!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.320
[Nonnie 
 whimpers]

18:01.000 --> 18:01.960
Reed!

18:01.960 --> 18:03.000
No! Not while 
 it's feeding!

18:03.000 --> 18:04.080
Aah!

18:06.400 --> 18:07.840
You fool!

18:07.840 --> 18:09.840
Look!

18:09.840 --> 18:11.360
You've unleashed it!

18:11.360 --> 18:12.440
What?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.360
It grows stronger 
 with each feeding.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.840
And now it's out!

18:15.840 --> 18:17.840
I managed 
 to contain it.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.160
But now that it's out, 
 it can feed at will.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.840
You mean that thing 
 can terrorize anybody?

18:23.840 --> 18:26.840
Yes! That's what it does. 
 I must stop it!

18:26.840 --> 18:27.840
How?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.360
I don't know.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.600
I just pray 
 I'm not too late!

18:35.920 --> 18:37.360
What should we do?

18:37.360 --> 18:39.360
I--I--I don't know.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.360
We gotta call 
 somebody, warn them.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.840
And say there's 
 a magic demon loose

18:43.840 --> 18:45.360
and it's gonna terr--

18:45.360 --> 18:48.360
<i> [moaning]</i>

18:48.360 --> 18:50.920
What happened?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.360
[Thunder]

18:52.360 --> 18:53.840
Reed...

18:53.840 --> 18:55.840
<i> [Moaning]</i>

18:55.840 --> 18:57.360
I think it's back.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.080
Maybe it never left.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.680
Come on.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.840
It wants us, Reed! It 
 wants to feed on us!

19:06.840 --> 19:09.120
We can't let it. 
 Clear your mind!

19:09.120 --> 19:11.160
don't think about 
 what scares you.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.680
Remember what Vink 
 said.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.800
Aah! 
 Aah!

19:33.640 --> 19:35.080
It's getting 
 stronger!

19:35.080 --> 19:36.560
We can't let it!

19:36.560 --> 19:37.720
No!

19:40.200 --> 19:41.720
Aah!

19:53.560 --> 19:55.200
Are you OK?

19:56.880 --> 19:58.440
No, I'm not.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.960
Ya gotta relax, 
 Nonnie.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.560
Don't think about 
 what scares you, OK?

20:02.560 --> 20:03.800
Yeah, but--

20:03.800 --> 20:05.320
You're safe in there.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.800
There's nothing in 
 there that can get you.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.200
Reed? I gotta get 
 outta here.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.200
There's nothing in 
 there to be afraid of.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.200
No, you don't 
 understand.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.800
I hate closed places.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.080
It's the room 
 that scares me.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.760
Reed!

20:24.760 --> 20:26.600
It's an illusion!

20:26.600 --> 20:28.080
Reed! Reed!

20:28.080 --> 20:30.080
Reed, you gotta 
 get me outta here!

20:30.080 --> 20:31.400
You've got to 
 fight it!

20:31.400 --> 20:34.200
I can't! I can't!

20:34.200 --> 20:37.080
You've got to! Face 
 your fear, Nonnie!

20:37.080 --> 20:38.240
Face your fear!

20:38.240 --> 20:39.320
I can't!

20:39.320 --> 20:42.360
Face your fear! 
 It can't get you!

20:42.360 --> 20:43.360
[Screaming]

20:43.360 --> 20:45.080
Face your fear...

20:45.080 --> 20:46.520
Face your fear!

20:46.520 --> 20:48.920
Reed, please! 
 Do something!

20:50.320 --> 20:52.520
Face your fear.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.480
You're not real.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.600
You're an illusion!

21:13.600 --> 21:15.480
Reed, help me!

21:15.480 --> 21:16.840
Get away from me!

21:19.720 --> 21:21.680
You're not real!

21:21.680 --> 21:23.760
You're a nightmare!

21:25.840 --> 21:27.520
I don't believe 
 in you!

21:27.520 --> 21:29.480
Reed, help me!

21:30.600 --> 21:31.560
Aah!

21:31.560 --> 21:33.840
You're not gonna 
 own me anymore!

21:44.760 --> 21:45.800
Nonnie.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.520
Nonnie!

21:52.280 --> 21:54.200
You OK?

21:54.200 --> 21:55.720
Yeah. What happened?

21:55.720 --> 21:57.720
It's over. 
 It's all over.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.200
I faced my fear. 
 I broke the spell!

22:00.200 --> 22:05.200
I don't think Vink's gonna be making 
 any more of his Dangerous Soup.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.200
That's where you're 
 wrong, my friend.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.000
It still knows 
 what scares you.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.880
I plan on being 
 in business

22:22.880 --> 22:26.640
a long, long time!

22:26.640 --> 22:29.160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

22:33.240 --> 22:34.440
The end.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.840
Great.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.640
Good story.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.840
That's weak.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.640
What if there's 
 nothing you're afraid of?

22:41.640 --> 22:43.440
The room wouldn't work.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.480
That's right. Nothing 
 scares you, does it?

22:46.480 --> 22:49.160
Maybe you should be 
 the first to, uh...

22:49.160 --> 22:51.360
Reach into the unknown.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.800
W-what's in it?

22:53.800 --> 22:55.280
What's the difference?

22:55.280 --> 22:57.360
You're not scared of 
 anything anyway.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.080
Y-yeah. That's right.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.240
Forget it.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.080
So... what's in it?

23:18.080 --> 23:20.040
Exactly what 
 Tucker's afraid of.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.600
Nothing.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.520
Very good.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.080
Awesome story, 
 Frank.
