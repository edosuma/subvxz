WEBVTT

00:05.135 --> 00:06.180
<i>I have cancer.</i>

00:07.877 --> 00:10.445
<i>We have a fight ahead of us.</i>

00:10.445 --> 00:12.621
<i>If the chemo didn't work,</i>

00:12.621 --> 00:15.363
there is not a lot
of other options.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.845
Your scan is clean.
There's no cancer.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.123
Oh, absolutely not.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.171
Carver?

00:41.171 --> 00:42.259
Morning.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.348
What are you doing here?

00:44.348 --> 00:46.481
Dropping off my tools
so I don't have to double back

00:46.481 --> 00:48.222
all the way to Roscoe
after shift.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.354
You got me the job, remember?
Reggie's reno.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.182
Yeah, I remember.

00:52.182 --> 00:55.098
'Cause he said
you were cool with some noise.

00:55.098 --> 00:58.884
Yes, when the sun is up,
not at 6:00 a.m.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.234
I'll try to keep it down.

01:00.234 --> 01:03.063
Yeah, don't bother.
I'm wide awake now.

01:05.630 --> 01:06.762
Hey, Ritter.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.199
Yeah, yeah,
I'm headed to Stan's now.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.722
Yeah, it was, what, four--

01:10.722 --> 01:15.423
four plain glazed,
four chocolate, and four--

01:41.275 --> 01:43.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:45.279 --> 01:48.020
How the hell do you work
in here without a door?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.587
It's the one drawback.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.154
Capp's always coming
through here day and night,

01:51.154 --> 01:52.547
couldn't care less
what I got going on.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.462
- Huh.
- How are you, Chief?

01:54.462 --> 01:57.465
I'm good.
I just, uh,

01:57.465 --> 02:00.772
wanted to let you know
you have been tapped to serve

02:00.772 --> 02:04.341
on a Homeland Security
anti-terrorism task force.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.256
There's a meeting downtown
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.128
What is this task force
all about?

02:08.128 --> 02:10.042
No idea,
but you'll know more soon.

02:10.042 --> 02:12.784
One of the other liaisons
is coming by in a half hour

02:12.784 --> 02:14.046
to give you a briefing.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.613
Okay, great. I'll be ready.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.055
Do I have my shifts mixed up?

02:23.055 --> 02:24.274
Was I on donut duty?

02:24.274 --> 02:26.798
No, I was. I just forgot.

02:26.798 --> 02:29.540
Sorry.
- Ah.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.802
Mm.

02:30.802 --> 02:31.847
No, wait.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.463
Can I sit now?

02:39.463 --> 02:41.117
Yeah, you gotta be careful.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.641
Some of these chairs
are safety risks.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.514
You didn't test mine
when I sat down.

02:46.514 --> 02:49.647
You're not about to break
the CFD shift streak.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.475
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

02:51.475 --> 02:55.392
Oh, that's fantastic news!

02:55.392 --> 02:57.220
Hey, hey, he's about
to set a new record.

02:57.220 --> 03:00.049
Most consecutive shifts
in a row--

03:00.049 --> 03:01.311
perfect attendance.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.618
- Hey.
- That's cool, man.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.010
It's not like they
give you a medal for it.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.577
Oh.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.013
You're gonna be the
Cal Ripken, Jr. of the CFD.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.451
You just gotta get past
this shift and one more.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.496
Don't do anything dangerous.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.281
You know we're firefighters,
right, Mouch?

03:16.935 --> 03:21.157
Mm, oh, this must be my guy.

03:21.157 --> 03:25.596
I got nominated to be on a
task force, Homeland Security.

03:25.596 --> 03:28.251
No biggie.
- Wow.

03:34.344 --> 03:37.129
Hey there.
Are you looking for me?

03:37.129 --> 03:38.870
I sure am.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.798
Why didn't you tell me

03:53.798 --> 03:55.452
when you were coming to town,
you jerk?

03:55.452 --> 03:56.627
It was kind of last minute.

03:56.627 --> 03:59.326
Oh, Kelly is gonna be so mad.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.457
He's not even here.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.763
He's still in Alabama?

04:01.763 --> 04:03.068
Yeah.

04:03.068 --> 04:06.158
You got me so good.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.292
I thought that you were
a task force liaison

04:09.292 --> 04:10.424
I'm supposed to be
meeting with.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.121
I am.

04:12.121 --> 04:14.341
It's an inter-departmental
task force

04:14.341 --> 04:16.256
comprising multiple cities.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.388
I'm here representing
the Portland FD,

04:18.388 --> 04:19.824
and I'm the one
who recommended you

04:19.824 --> 04:22.653
be one of the CFD liaisons.

04:22.653 --> 04:25.352
Nice, a boondoggle.

04:25.352 --> 04:28.180
Got yourself
a free trip to Chicago.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.660
Look, come say hi to everyone.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.619
They are going to freak out.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.578
Yeah, it's not
a boondoggle, Kidd.

04:34.578 --> 04:37.494
This isn't some boring
conference we're going to.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.975
The reason it came together
so quick is because

04:39.975 --> 04:43.021
it's in response to stuff
that's happening in real time.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.675
What kind of stuff?

04:44.675 --> 04:46.329
I'm not supposed to be
talking about it

04:46.329 --> 04:47.852
outside of our sessions.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.767
It's not
for general consumption.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.074
You got the whole
rundown tomorrow.

04:52.074 --> 04:56.208
But as far as everyone else
is concerned,

04:56.208 --> 04:58.733
let them think
it's a boondoggle, okay?

04:58.733 --> 05:01.475
Whoa, hey,
you can't just say

05:01.475 --> 05:03.041
"stuff that's happening
in real time"

05:03.041 --> 05:04.956
and then not give me
any details.

05:04.956 --> 05:08.177
I don't really have
a choice, sorry to say.

05:08.177 --> 05:09.570
Come on.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.618
Hey, guys.
all: Hey!

05:17.752 --> 05:19.710
You're telling me
that entire time,

05:19.710 --> 05:21.321
you've never missed
a single shift?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.542
I'm not buying it.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.501
I'm gonna need to see the
paperwork on this one, Chief.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.154
Yeah, I'll vouch for him.
It's legit.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.721
I didn't even
realize it myself

05:30.721 --> 05:31.896
until Capp mentioned it.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.942
I just kept coming
to work every day.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.900
Incredible.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.339
So you're acting up.
How's that?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.689
I had no idea
you officers worked so much.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.821
I thought all you guys
had to do was yell at people.

05:46.171 --> 05:47.434
You the new guy on Truck?

05:47.434 --> 05:48.609
Sam Carver.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.088
Nice to finally meet you.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.525
Kidd's been telling me
all about you.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.091
Mm-hmm, everything.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.310
I tell him everything.

05:54.310 --> 05:57.182
- Uh-oh.
- Oh.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.836
Sylvie.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.230
- Hey, Casey.
- Hey, Violet.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.450
I should have said something,
I know,

06:03.450 --> 06:05.365
but it was so last minute.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.584
How are you?

06:07.584 --> 06:09.673
Living the dream, you know?

06:09.673 --> 06:11.719
You?
- I'm good.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.982
I got roped
into this conference--

06:13.982 --> 06:15.418
me and Kidd, actually.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.159
It's the HS thing.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.727
Figure it was perfect timing
because I get to be in town

06:19.727 --> 06:21.685
for Cindy's
"Sayonara Cancer" party.

06:21.685 --> 06:22.991
How awesome for her.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.471
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.951
She is gonna flip
when she sees you there, Casey.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.258
Oh, that reminds me,
we gotta fire up

06:29.258 --> 06:31.086
that oven over at Molly's
and make sure

06:31.086 --> 06:32.783
the thing's still working.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.306
All right,
Cindy's appetite is back,

06:34.306 --> 06:36.787
and the woman is
demanding finger food.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.267
Oh, okay, okay.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.790
My vote, absolutely,
pigs in a blanket.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.053
Jalapeño poppers.

06:46.667 --> 06:47.668
Spring cleaning?

06:47.668 --> 06:49.800
Oh, uh, yeah.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.455
It's a little out of hand.

06:52.455 --> 06:53.413
How are the boys?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.892
Great.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.112
Ben got accepted
to two schools so far.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.854
We're still waiting
to hear from a few others.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.899
- That's exciting.
- Yeah.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.293
How have you been?
- Um, pretty good.

07:04.293 --> 07:08.428
Yeah, just busy
with paramedicine and, uh...

07:10.517 --> 07:11.996
You know what, I'm just gonna
put this out there.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.955
I've been seeing someone.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.000
He's a really good guy.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.567
That's great.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.135
You don't have to feel weird
about that.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.442
I knew what it meant
to move on,

07:22.442 --> 07:24.879
and I've been
seeing someone too.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.489
Yeah?

07:26.489 --> 07:31.799
Yeah, it's not serious yet,
but it's getting there,

07:31.799 --> 07:33.540
I guess.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.194
Same.

07:36.194 --> 07:39.894
Well, I'm in town
till Cindy's party.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.199
I'd love to catch up.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.940
Are you going to Molly's
after shift?

07:42.940 --> 07:45.029
Uh, no, I have--

07:45.029 --> 07:48.642
I have plans,
but maybe on the later side?

07:48.642 --> 07:50.382
I'll be there all night.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.515
Great.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.526
I'll take this. Boop.

08:03.526 --> 08:06.398
I can't believe
you just did that.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.836
Ritter, did you know there's
a citywide noise ordinance

08:08.836 --> 08:11.012
from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.?

08:11.012 --> 08:13.493
How many times
do I have to apologize?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.798
I'm missing something.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.278
Violet's neighbor
hired me to do some work.

08:16.278 --> 08:18.410
On my recommendation,
which I would not have given

08:18.410 --> 08:20.500
had I known you'd be waking me
up at all hours of the night.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.545
- 6:00 a.m.?
- That's what I'm saying.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.507
All good?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.987
Yeah, why?

08:29.987 --> 08:31.728
You just been really quiet
this morning.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.556
Ah, no, it's--I didn't get
much sleep last night.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.517
<i>Squad 3, Truck 81, Ambo 61,</i>

08:37.517 --> 08:41.564
<i>person trapped,
1414 South Wood Street.</i>

08:44.959 --> 08:48.397
Oh, look at that.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.280
Thank God you're here.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.282
My husband, Jerry,
was under the house

09:04.282 --> 09:06.458
working on some plumbing.
Right down there.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.677
All right, ma'am,
just stand back. Capp.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.681
Stand by.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.465
I'm gonna go down
and check it out.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.989
Copy that.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.911
Fire department. Call out.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.521
I'm over here.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.784
Ah, you've gotta
get me out of here.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.394
That's the plan.

09:29.394 --> 09:32.528
Don't make any
sudden movements okay?

09:32.528 --> 09:33.529
Please.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.845
All right, we gotta gear up.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.716
We need coats, hoods, SCBAs.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.370
There's a swarm of bees
down there.

09:48.370 --> 09:49.763
What?

09:49.763 --> 09:51.068
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Lieutenant, you okay?

09:51.068 --> 09:52.983
Yeah, I'm good.
Just a couple bees stings.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.159
Bees?
Tony's allergic to bees.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.465
I'm fine.

09:56.465 --> 09:57.640
That's what
we have EpiPens for.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.903
Ah, forget it, Tony.
Wait in the squad.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.949
The victim's hand
is caught in a pipe.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.167
He pulled it back too fast
when the bees swarmed him,

10:03.167 --> 10:04.908
so it's caught in there
pretty good.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.910
Doesn't smoke calm down bees?

10:06.910 --> 10:09.347
I'm not bringing an open
flame into that crawlspace.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.435
Yeah.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.307
You could freeze them out.

10:12.307 --> 10:13.613
My dad kept bees.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.049
It was a retirement hobby.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.224
The smoke thing is true,

10:16.224 --> 10:17.704
but they don't like the cold, either.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.183
CO2 extinguishers.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.446
Worth a try. Go grab them.
All right.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.753
Squad, I need a vent

10:23.753 --> 10:25.450
on the bravo side.
- Mm-hmm.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.974
So we'll get the victim
from below.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.629
You find the other end
of that pipe inside the house,

10:29.629 --> 10:32.327
cut it for us.
- You got it. Squad.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.416
All right, Gallo, Carver,

10:34.416 --> 10:35.417
we're gonna
bucket brigade this.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.810
So Gallo, you're with me.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.115
Carver, you're in the middle.
Let's go.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.727
both: Copy.
- Ma'am.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.859
Hey, Capp, cut an
access point there.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.078
Copy.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.016
Ah, damn it.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.845
Okay.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.200
- Hey, let me get that Sawzall.
- Yeah.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.599
All right, this'll help
with the spray coming in.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.818
- Okay. Okay.
- All right?

11:32.213 --> 11:34.476
Yeah?

11:34.476 --> 11:36.521
Carver, extinguisher!

11:36.521 --> 11:37.914
Copy.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.229
All right, go!

12:00.632 --> 12:02.591
Okay, we're good!
- Yeah.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.114
Okay.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.860
Almost there.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.865
Cruz, you're looking
for a 4-inch PVC.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.214
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

12:22.916 --> 12:24.700
All right, Kidd, you're clear.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.010
There we go.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.229
All right,
let's get you out of here.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.144
Okay.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.364
The burning sensation
should go away in a few hours,

12:36.364 --> 12:38.888
but the swelling
should go down in a few days.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.629
Normally, I'd recommend
some Advil and an ice pack,

12:40.629 --> 12:42.587
but there's so many stings,

12:42.587 --> 12:44.589
sometimes there's
a delayed reaction,

12:44.589 --> 12:46.548
and I think we should take him
to Chicago Med for observation.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.158
Ah, there we go.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.204
I'll meet you
at the hospital.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.293
I don't wanna say
I told you so,

12:52.293 --> 12:54.121
but we're hiring a plumber.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.130
- Morning, ma'am.
- Hi.

13:05.088 --> 13:08.091
- Can I help you with anything?
- Maybe.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.746
Is this where
Blake Gallo works?

13:10.746 --> 13:12.269
Yeah.

13:12.269 --> 13:15.359
His truck is on a call,
but you're welcome to hang out

13:15.359 --> 13:16.752
and wait for him to get back.

13:16.752 --> 13:21.713
Oh, um, no, no,
that's--that's okay.

13:21.713 --> 13:22.802
Can I pass along a message?

13:22.802 --> 13:26.501
Yeah, um, just tell him--

13:26.501 --> 13:30.461
tell him I'm staying at
the Travelodge on Harrison.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.724
Okay.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.117
Your name?

13:34.117 --> 13:35.945
Lacey.

13:35.945 --> 13:38.165
He'll know who I am.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.862
Thanks.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.522
Should we listen
to the rest of the podcast

13:47.522 --> 13:48.828
on the way home?

13:48.828 --> 13:49.829
They make a pretty
compelling argument

13:49.829 --> 13:51.482
about the Avril Lavigne clone.

13:51.482 --> 13:52.832
Yeah, sure.

14:02.624 --> 14:06.019
Why wouldn't he tell me
he was coming to town?

14:06.019 --> 14:07.455
Well, it sounds like
this Homeland Security thing

14:07.455 --> 14:08.673
came up pretty fast.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.284
And didn't you guys
agree to ease up

14:10.284 --> 14:13.330
on communication 'cause talking
all the time was too hard?

14:13.330 --> 14:15.245
Yeah, I thought it would
create some distance,

14:15.245 --> 14:16.768
and then he shows up
at the firehouse

14:16.768 --> 14:19.162
when I thought
he was 2,000 miles away.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.034
That was quite the surprise.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.383
If I'd known he was coming,

14:22.383 --> 14:25.647
I could have at least
mentally prepared.

14:42.446 --> 14:46.624
All I'm saying is, bees are
an admirable, selfless insect.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.888
Tell that to the guy
with a dozen welts on his arm.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.367
He was disturbing their hive.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.935
They were defending their home.
- Hey, I get it.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.156
If somebody came after 51,
I'd sting their ass too.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.117
Hey, Gallo.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.379
Hey.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.381
Some woman came by looking
for you earlier.

15:04.381 --> 15:05.861
Lacey?

15:05.861 --> 15:08.385
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

15:08.385 --> 15:11.345
And she gave me the name
of the hotel she's staying at.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.175
Do I wanna ask?

15:15.175 --> 15:19.614
She's my--
she's my aunt, technically.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.963
Technically?

15:20.963 --> 15:22.965
I don't remember
the last time I saw her,

15:22.965 --> 15:25.925
but all of a sudden,
she's blowing up my phone,

15:25.925 --> 15:28.275
trying to reconnect,
and now she comes here?

15:30.364 --> 15:33.019
I'm sorry you had
to deal with this.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.716
I'm gonna take care of it.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.464
One more shift, so don't do
anything stupid this weekend.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.596
Accidents can happen
with anything.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.989
It's true--cars, bikes.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.905
Boats, trees, lawnmowers.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.255
You know, maybe it's better
if you just

15:52.255 --> 15:53.865
don't leave your house
for a few days.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.998
You guys are really annoying.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.000
Oh! Hey, hey, hey!

15:58.000 --> 15:59.262
- Whoa!
- See?

15:59.262 --> 16:02.091
- Sorry, guys.
- Danger is all around,

16:02.091 --> 16:03.440
and if you don't make it
through next shift,

16:03.440 --> 16:06.226
that record will remain
in Rutledge's hands.

16:06.226 --> 16:09.142
Rutledge, the guy you had
the little prank thing with?

16:09.142 --> 16:11.579
It was not
some little prank thing.

16:11.579 --> 16:15.800
It was one of many battles
in a career-long war.

16:19.065 --> 16:22.024
I know a lot of youse
are wondering why you're here.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.287
So let me bring someone up
that can give us all

16:24.287 --> 16:27.029
a little background,
someone that a lot of us

16:27.029 --> 16:31.033
already know and respect
because he used to be CFD.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.992
Captain Matt Casey,
it's good to see you back.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.649
Thanks, Chief Walker.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.825
It's good to be back.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.001
It's true.

16:42.001 --> 16:46.222
I was CFD
for a long, long time.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.007
But for the last couple
of years,

16:48.007 --> 16:49.399
I've been working out west

16:49.399 --> 16:51.488
with the
Portland Fire Department.

16:51.488 --> 16:55.144
As most of you probably know,
the Pacific Northwest

16:55.144 --> 16:58.060
has been the site of several
recent terrorist attacks

16:58.060 --> 17:01.542
on the electrical grid
by unknown actors.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.025
Two weeks ago,
I was incident commander

17:06.025 --> 17:08.027
on a fire
in an abandoned building

17:08.027 --> 17:10.159
just outside Portland.

17:10.159 --> 17:13.075
During overhaul, we discovered
suspicious documents,

17:13.075 --> 17:14.903
so we got the FBI involved.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.557
Turns out the building
was connected

17:16.557 --> 17:19.168
to an anti-government
organization.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.475
The evidence we found
suggested they may be planning

17:21.475 --> 17:24.173
infrastructure attacks
in several major cities

17:24.173 --> 17:29.048
across the U.S., including
right here in Chicago.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.615
Now, the folks
at Homeland Security

17:31.615 --> 17:34.879
are telling me it's not
a specific threat as of yet.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.707
They want to establish
a network

17:36.707 --> 17:39.536
of first responder liaisons
in all the target cities

17:39.536 --> 17:43.366
to help disseminate intel
as it arises.

17:43.366 --> 17:48.241
Here's Chris McManus from DHS
to explain how it'll work.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.209
Blake, I'm so glad you came.

18:00.209 --> 18:03.038
Wow, you look so--
you're so grown up.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.562
Well, it's been 16 years, so.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.087
It has.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.743
There's a nice place next door
if you wanna grab some brunch.

18:12.743 --> 18:13.744
I'm not hungry.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.442
Okay, well--

18:15.442 --> 18:17.096
You know, actually, like,
kind of on a schedule.

18:17.096 --> 18:21.012
So, uh, why are you here?

18:21.012 --> 18:22.710
Well, it's sort of
a long story,

18:22.710 --> 18:24.451
but I guess the main thing is,

18:24.451 --> 18:27.410
is I'm trying to get back
on track.

18:27.410 --> 18:31.110
Yeah, trying to get back
to the me before the fire.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.372
I went down a bad path.

18:32.372 --> 18:35.026
There was lots of drinking, drugs,

18:35.026 --> 18:36.593
things that I am not proud of,

18:36.593 --> 18:40.119
but I have been clean
for a few months now.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.598
I'm glad to hear that.

18:41.598 --> 18:44.688
Yeah, I'm in a program,
trying to make amends.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.345
So I'm just a box to tick?

18:49.345 --> 18:51.173
No!

18:51.173 --> 18:53.958
Oh, no, no, Blake,
it's not like that.

18:53.958 --> 18:57.658
Blake, I have regretted
leaving you

18:57.658 --> 19:00.400
every day since I did.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.185
But when it happened,
when--when your mom died,

19:03.185 --> 19:07.668
my sister,
I kind of lost my mind.

19:07.668 --> 19:08.799
I didn't know what to do.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.323
I was so scared.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.673
I knew you were safe staying
with your Uncle Carmine.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.284
I didn't--I didn't
know Uncle Carmine.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.162
But my Aunt Lacey?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.467
She took me to the movies.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.383
She sat with me in church
where we giggled

19:27.383 --> 19:29.168
and we drew cartoons and...

19:31.648 --> 19:33.694
I knew her.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.000
I just thought it was better
if I stayed away.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.916
Stayed away?
You disappeared.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.483
You disappeared on me.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.007
I lost everyone.

19:43.007 --> 19:44.792
And you disappeared.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.185
I was 23.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.492
I was a kid.
- No, no, I was a kid.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.890
All right, I guess you--you
said everything you needed to.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.674
Wait, wait, just wait.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.200
Here, just take this.

20:02.549 --> 20:06.074
There's a storage unit
next to your old house.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.684
I came back to clean it out.

20:07.684 --> 20:10.470
I was hoping
you'd help me, but it's--

20:12.820 --> 20:14.213
You should look through it.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.084
There's lots of your mom's
old stuff there.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.226
I am so sorry, Blake.

20:41.196 --> 20:42.980
You know,
you should feel honored.

20:42.980 --> 20:43.981
The last time I went to a play

20:43.981 --> 20:45.156
was because my sister
was in it.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.506
Oh, yeah?

20:46.506 --> 20:49.248
She played Toto
in "Wizard of Oz."

20:49.248 --> 20:50.945
Um, can I see that?

20:50.945 --> 20:53.077
Yeah.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.471
How about you?
You do any theater growing up?

20:55.471 --> 20:59.519
Uh, once in high school.
I was Laurey in "Oklahoma!"

20:59.519 --> 21:01.172
Oh, yeah?

21:01.172 --> 21:04.654
Oh, this play
is three hours long.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.787
But I hear it's excellent.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.310
It goes by like that.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.138
Seriously, great reviews.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.450
Whoa, hey,
hot plate coming through.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.668
Look out.

21:18.668 --> 21:22.150
All right, guys,
mini corn dogs.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.325
See what you think.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.327
I'm auditioning them
for Cindy's party.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.329
Hey, can we get some
without toothpicks?

21:27.329 --> 21:28.548
Just playing it safe.

21:30.724 --> 21:33.030
What do you think?

21:33.030 --> 21:34.467
All right.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.556
You better chew
at least 20 times.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.949
Those weenies
are a choking hazard.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.955
Here's one on the house

21:44.955 --> 21:48.350
for the keynote speaker,
Mr. VIP.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.656
Yeah, yeah.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.006
I am serious.

21:52.006 --> 21:54.400
Listen, you're obviously
making big impressions

21:54.400 --> 21:56.706
on important people.

21:56.706 --> 22:00.231
What I don't get is why
you think anyone

22:00.231 --> 22:01.929
would want me involved
in this thing.

22:01.929 --> 22:05.715
The DHS guys need first
responders they can trust,

22:05.715 --> 22:09.328
and I can't think
of anyone more trustworthy.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.242
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.334
Oh, man, do we miss you.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.641
I miss you guys too.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.472
- You know what would be fun?
- What?

22:23.472 --> 22:25.474
You should do a ride along
on Truck for old time's sake.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.522
We'll let you kick in a door,
put out a pot of meat.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.262
Ah, I like it.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.351
All right.

22:34.788 --> 22:38.269
Any idea when Brett's due?

22:38.269 --> 22:39.619
Is she coming?

22:39.619 --> 22:40.576
I thought she was out
with a friend.

22:40.576 --> 22:43.536
Oh, Dylan? Yeah.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.060
I know all about him.
- Mm.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.671
I heard you got somebody
keeping you busy out there too.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.370
What's her name?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.546
Ah, it's not that serious.

22:53.546 --> 22:57.506
Who said it had to be serious
as long as you're having fun?

22:57.506 --> 22:59.421
Are you?

22:59.421 --> 23:00.944
Sure.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.820
Oh, there isn't anybody,
is there?

23:08.996 --> 23:11.694
I'm out there,
but nothing really sticks.

23:11.694 --> 23:14.044
Mm, well, why is that?

23:15.524 --> 23:16.699
Why do you think?

23:23.184 --> 23:25.708
That worked so well
when you were trying

23:25.708 --> 23:27.318
to fix your garbage disposal.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.059
Yes, I almost had that.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.757
I walked in on you shoving
a broom handle down the drain.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.193
That's what
Google said to do.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.891
I can fix it.
Just tell me what to do.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.719
How about I swing by
and have a look?

23:36.719 --> 23:38.286
Thank you.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.983
It's better not to risk it
with electrical stuff.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.637
Oh, yeah, and you just
don't think I can do it.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.466
Not what I said.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.772
Calling it a night?

23:45.772 --> 23:46.990
Yeah.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.992
Whoa, whoa,
why don't you wait a bit

23:48.992 --> 23:50.777
and grab a ride with us?

23:50.777 --> 23:52.692
Nah, I'll just call an Uber.

23:57.218 --> 23:58.654
Is everything okay with him?

23:58.654 --> 24:00.830
Every time I ask,
he says he's fine.

24:00.830 --> 24:04.355
Uh, it's family stuff,
I think.

24:04.355 --> 24:08.359
I thought
his family wasn't around.

24:08.359 --> 24:09.796
What's the story there?

24:12.102 --> 24:13.887
Uh...

24:13.887 --> 24:17.412
There was a fire
when he was a kid--

24:17.412 --> 24:19.501
at 12, I think.

24:19.501 --> 24:20.894
Yeah.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.373
And the fire company
that responded,

24:22.373 --> 24:25.942
they were able to pull him out,
but everyone else--

24:25.942 --> 24:29.076
mom, dad, little sister...

24:30.904 --> 24:32.122
He lost them all?

24:35.082 --> 24:37.345
And the guy grows up
to be a firefighter.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.609
How about that?

24:40.609 --> 24:43.699
It's how he processed
all that pain,

24:43.699 --> 24:45.919
turned it into something good.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.703
Yeah, I wonder
what's rattled him now.

25:16.471 --> 25:17.516
No way.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.516
<i>kids: ♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪</i>

26:01.516 --> 26:05.999
<i>♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪</i>

26:05.999 --> 26:08.175
<i>♪ And a happy new year</i>

26:08.175 --> 26:11.308
<i>Merry Christmas, Mom.
From Madeline and Blake.</i>

26:30.153 --> 26:32.678
Gallo, toss me the WD-40.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.290
Gallo?
- Huh?

26:36.290 --> 26:40.207
- I got it.
- Oh, uh, sorry.

26:40.207 --> 26:45.038
All right, let's get these
compartments packed up and--

26:45.038 --> 26:47.127
well, well, well.

26:47.127 --> 26:51.392
Matt Casey reporting
for duty, Lieutenant.

26:51.392 --> 26:54.787
Gentlemen, we have ourselves
a new candidate.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.876
Remember,
hazing is frowned upon.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.791
So don't do it
in front of Chief Boden.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.009
Understood.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.229
All right,
go ahead, get settled in.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.100
I think you know
your way around.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.363
Yeah, I think I do.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.678
What happened?

27:16.678 --> 27:18.811
You look two days from death.
What is it?

27:18.811 --> 27:22.553
- Food poisoning.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

27:22.553 --> 27:25.600
Herrmann, did you even check
the expiration date

27:25.600 --> 27:26.993
on those corn dogs?

27:26.993 --> 27:28.472
Oh, this ain't on me.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.997
The serving size
was three dogs, all right?

27:30.997 --> 27:32.520
He ate the whole pan.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.479
So 40 mini dogs is the same
as, I don't know,

27:35.479 --> 27:37.568
eight regular hot dogs?

27:37.568 --> 27:39.179
You shouldn't get sick
from that.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.354
Yeah, you should!

27:40.354 --> 27:42.530
What kind of hot dogs
do you eat?

27:45.098 --> 27:48.362
I swear Javi is a foot taller
every time I see him.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.146
Same, and I see him
every day.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.064
Oh, man,
look at that smile on Otis.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.718
Yeah.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.373
I took Griffin and Ben
kayaking on Timothy Lake.

27:59.373 --> 28:00.548
Oh.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.202
It's really gorgeous.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.594
Caught a bunch of trout.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.466
Oh, man,
that looks like a blast.

28:05.466 --> 28:06.467
Yeah, it really was.

28:06.467 --> 28:07.816
Wow.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.732
So how do you like
being the boss?

28:12.212 --> 28:14.170
I'm not gonna lie,
it's pretty cool, actually.

28:16.085 --> 28:20.742
I still haven't figured out
the work-life balance.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.875
This job is all-consuming.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.441
No doubt.

28:24.441 --> 28:26.705
Leadership requires
a lot of sacrifice.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.403
So does family.

28:29.403 --> 28:31.013
There's always a price to pay.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.974
But it sounds like you're good
at the lieutenant stuff.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.845
If it's something
you wanna pursue,

28:36.845 --> 28:38.194
I'm sure you'll find your way.

28:41.241 --> 28:44.418
Let's go, drills, app floor.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.854
I'm not wearing that.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.943
You are if you don't wanna
get written up.

28:47.943 --> 28:48.988
Move!

28:48.988 --> 28:50.511
Whoa.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.165
Candidate!

28:52.165 --> 28:53.514
Come on, pick it up, 81.

28:53.514 --> 28:56.560
Are you really gonna
let this Portland FD clown

28:56.560 --> 28:59.259
beat you again?

28:59.259 --> 29:02.088
Done.

29:02.088 --> 29:05.265
I am disappointed.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.483
That was four times in a row.

29:06.483 --> 29:07.876
He holds the house record.

29:07.876 --> 29:08.964
All right, I'm gonna
have to get in here

29:08.964 --> 29:10.226
and give you
some real competition.

29:10.226 --> 29:13.229
You're on after lunch.

29:13.229 --> 29:14.578
Mm.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.290
Don't think
I've seen that before.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.292
Yeah, I just found it.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.598
It was my mom's.

29:34.598 --> 29:35.817
It's nice.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.049
We trip a breaker?
What happened?

29:50.049 --> 29:52.442
Ah!
Turn those off.

29:52.442 --> 29:54.009
- Why?
- Tony is convalescing.

30:00.929 --> 30:03.366
What's wrong?

30:03.366 --> 30:05.238
All right, that's it.
I'm calling in a floater.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.849
- No!
- I have to.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.546
It's my responsibility
as acting lieutenant.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.113
He'll be fine.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.636
Remember when he broke a toe
in the middle of a call

30:12.636 --> 30:13.986
and didn't miss a beat?

30:13.986 --> 30:15.814
Or when he got hit
by that drunk bicyclist?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.859
A little food poisoning
won't take him out.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.775
He's just conserving energy.

30:25.693 --> 30:28.870
I need to hear it from you.

30:28.870 --> 30:33.744
If we--if we get a call,
I will rally.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.666
The idea is to give
your firefighters a leg up

30:42.666 --> 30:44.886
in case they respond
to one of these attacks

30:44.886 --> 30:48.194
or maybe even get a chance
to prevent one in progress.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.500
Is there a time frame
on this kind of threat?

30:50.500 --> 30:51.675
I don't think so.

30:51.675 --> 30:53.112
It's all pretty vague.

30:53.112 --> 30:55.027
I'm hoping it's just
empty bluster, but--

30:55.027 --> 30:59.074
But we all know what these
sort of people are capable of.

30:59.074 --> 31:02.512
When I saw Chicago
on that list of target cities,

31:02.512 --> 31:03.557
I had to get involved.

31:03.557 --> 31:04.775
Mm.

31:06.212 --> 31:08.779
This is still home
in a lot of ways.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.999
Yeah, so...

31:12.958 --> 31:14.829
When are you coming back?

31:17.092 --> 31:20.661
Ben will be off
to college next year.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.924
I'd love to return,
but some things

31:22.924 --> 31:24.665
have to fall into place first.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.406
Like?

31:28.277 --> 31:31.759
<i>Truck 81, person trapped,
650 South Wayman.</i>

31:31.759 --> 31:33.587
That's me.

31:33.587 --> 31:37.156
Yeah, go get them.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.565
So we had an arrest warrant
for the boyfriend

31:55.565 --> 31:57.959
of one of the residents, wanted
for a string of robberies.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.353
Idiot bailed out of the window
when we knocked

32:00.353 --> 32:01.963
on his girlfriend's door.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.443
Help!

32:03.443 --> 32:04.966
We need to move all these
cop cars out of the way

32:04.966 --> 32:06.576
so we can deploy the aerial.

32:06.576 --> 32:07.621
All right, Carver, help them.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.623
Copy.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.973
Hurry, please!

32:11.973 --> 32:14.193
Lieutenant,
I think I can grab him

32:14.193 --> 32:15.803
from the fourth floor.
- Yeah, do it.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.370
- Yeah.
- Help!

32:27.858 --> 32:29.686
Fire department!

32:35.518 --> 32:36.824
Hey, please.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.695
I got you, all right?

32:41.133 --> 32:43.222
All right. All right, bud.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.661
What's your name?

32:47.661 --> 32:49.968
- Joel.
- All right, Joel.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.014
Well, if you just hang on
for a second longer,

32:53.014 --> 32:54.320
I got you, all right?

32:54.320 --> 32:56.365
Ah!

33:04.112 --> 33:05.374
Come on.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.072
Mouch!
Hurry it up with that aerial.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.030
- Right.
- Come on, don't let go.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.858
I'm not gonna let go.
I'm not letting you go.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.209
Please!

33:18.213 --> 33:20.737
On three. One, two, three.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.092
Don't drop me!

33:53.292 --> 33:55.076
So what'd you think?

33:55.076 --> 33:58.166
We give your new company
a run for their money?

33:58.166 --> 34:00.386
Yeah, come see for yourself.

34:00.386 --> 34:01.952
We got a muster in June.

34:05.478 --> 34:08.437
Hey, that save back there
was something special.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.787
No, I was just doing
what had to be done.

34:10.787 --> 34:13.921
Yeah, but not a lot of people
could have done that.

34:13.921 --> 34:17.011
Not a lot of firefighters
could have done that.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.753
You're getting to be
one hell of a smoke-eater.

34:21.450 --> 34:22.973
Thanks, Captain.

34:29.632 --> 34:31.591
Hmm, the Gallo I know
would have

34:31.591 --> 34:33.767
post-gamed that call
all the way home.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.856
We made the save,
nothing to post-game.

34:38.467 --> 34:43.429
It messed me up when
my brother resurfaced.

34:43.429 --> 34:46.084
I was distracted at work,
couldn't sleep,

34:46.084 --> 34:49.174
said and did things I regret.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.785
I wasn't myself.

34:51.785 --> 34:54.440
Ritter and Violet told me
you might be in a similar boat.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.967
My aunt, out of nowhere,

34:59.967 --> 35:02.622
wants to make nice
after all these years.

35:04.450 --> 35:05.625
I've been angry
for a really long time.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.105
That doesn't just go away.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.629
I get it,

35:09.629 --> 35:13.720
but not everyone
tries to fix their mistakes.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.115
If she really wants
to be a part of your life,

35:17.115 --> 35:19.465
that's not something
to take for granted.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.478
So how do we
make this official?

35:32.478 --> 35:33.957
I'll get the word out
through my union buddies.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.221
They'll put it
in the monthly bulletin.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.353
But I might swing by 40,

35:38.353 --> 35:40.355
break the news
to Rutledge myself.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.401
I cannot wait to see his face.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.619
How should we celebrate?

35:43.619 --> 35:45.404
Sleep and a tub of antacid.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.057
Oh, hey, 7:00.

35:47.057 --> 35:49.669
Get ready to rage.
It's sayonara, cancer.

35:49.669 --> 35:53.455
Cindy has requested
a specialty margarita menu

35:53.455 --> 35:55.675
and Blondie on the speakers.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.633
Hey.

35:57.633 --> 36:00.158
You stay home, all right? Rest.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.637
Cindy will understand.

36:01.637 --> 36:03.335
Yeah, no, I'll be there.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.293
Oh, all right.

36:05.293 --> 36:06.512
Yes!

36:06.512 --> 36:09.079
Squadzilla!
- My guy.

36:10.864 --> 36:14.563
What are you supposed to do
with the--with the red wire?

36:18.872 --> 36:21.004
Carver didn't label a red wire.

36:22.528 --> 36:27.446
And you don't have a red wire.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.537
If you had a ceiling fan.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.713
That's what would
power the motor,

36:33.713 --> 36:35.802
but with this light,
you don't need it.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.151
Oh.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.240
Guess I really didn't
need your help after all.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.156
How about this?

36:42.156 --> 36:44.637
I'll hold it up there
while you screw it in.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.813
That way, you can still say
that you installed it.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.771
Fine.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.559
Here we go.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.038
Seager must be bummed
with you spending

36:55.038 --> 36:56.562
all your extra time here.

36:56.562 --> 36:59.042
If it were me, I'd be
pretty jealous of Reggie.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.090
No, that's long over.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.657
Oh?

37:04.657 --> 37:07.268
Yeah, it was just
a short, casual thing.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.269
No jealousy there.

37:08.269 --> 37:09.444
Huh.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.405
There's one screw left.
I think I got it from here.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.971
Are you sure? It's no bother.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.496
Yeah, no, no,
I got it, thanks.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.193
You should probably
get back to work.

37:19.193 --> 37:21.151
All right.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.767
See you tonight at the thing?

37:27.767 --> 37:29.986
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Nice.

37:43.130 --> 37:47.265

37:47.265 --> 37:51.878

37:51.878 --> 37:56.274

37:56.274 --> 37:57.231

37:57.231 --> 37:58.319
You gotta be kidding.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.762
Chief to you.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.288
Oh, boy.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.681
Hey, pal, move it along.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.990
I am so glad
you could make it.

38:16.990 --> 38:20.254
I'm so glad
<i>you</i> could make it, Cindy.

38:23.866 --> 38:27.435
Hey, you're not leaving
already, are you?

38:27.435 --> 38:30.525
Yeah, I promised Dylan that
I would meet him at his bar.

38:34.094 --> 38:37.489
It was really good to see you
back in action at 51, Matt,

38:37.489 --> 38:41.797
even if it was just for
one shift and as a candidate.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.586
Safe travels tomorrow.

38:49.152 --> 38:52.286
Well, it was good
to see you, too, Sylvie.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.377
Real good.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.724
Sorry, Carver,
no bourbon tonight,

39:38.724 --> 39:41.204
strictly margaritas only--

39:41.204 --> 39:42.684
Cindy's orders.

39:42.684 --> 39:44.730
Fine, I'll do
whatever Gallo's doing.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.950
All right, two sweet
and spicies coming up.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.216
So I've been
thinking about it.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.088
You know what?

39:55.088 --> 39:57.090
That save was really awesome.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.309
- There he is.
- No, I just had it in my head.

39:59.309 --> 40:01.486
I couldn't stop thinking,
I can't let go, I can't let go.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.183
And then Casey comes out
of nowhere

40:03.183 --> 40:04.967
like Captain America.

40:04.967 --> 40:05.968
He's--

40:13.672 --> 40:15.456
My aunt's at a bar
in Logan Square.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.240
Damn it.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.981
- You want me to come?
- No, thanks.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.205
<i>Hey, it's Lacey.</i>

40:25.205 --> 40:27.207
<i>Leave a message.</i>

40:27.207 --> 40:28.426
Hey, it's me.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.559
I'm almost there
if you wanna come outside.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.474
I'll see you in a second.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.499
No, no.

40:58.499 --> 41:00.849
No, no, no.
