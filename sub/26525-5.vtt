WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:04.482
My name is Kara Zor-El
and I'm from Krypton.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.484
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.660
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.704 --> 00:11.141
But my pod
got knocked off course.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.490
And by the time I got here,

00:12.534 --> 00:15.319
my cousin had already grown up and become...

00:15.363 --> 00:17.321
Superman.

00:17.365 --> 00:20.020
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:20.063 --> 00:23.501
when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.545 --> 00:27.201
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.333
But in secret I work
with my adopted sister

00:29.377 --> 00:32.510
at the DEO to protect
this planet I call my home

00:32.554 --> 00:34.599
from anyone that means
to cause it harm.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.213
I am Supergirl.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.084
Previously onSupergirl...

00:41.128 --> 00:44.174
I have a feeling that
if you go out there again,

00:44.218 --> 00:45.871
something bad will happen.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.177
You are trending.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.439
In a bad way.

00:48.483 --> 00:49.701
I'm Colonel Lauren Haley.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.442
And how long
will you be with us, Colonel?

00:51.486 --> 00:52.878
As long as it takes.

00:52.922 --> 00:55.185
You joined up for a reason.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.057
You wanted to make
something of yourself.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.450
It's the alien, Parasite.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.452
It finds a host, feeds off
whatever energy the host
comes into contact with

01:01.496 --> 01:02.758
turning them into husks.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.803
The more he absorbs,
the more dangerous he is.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.945
The last time I was
on this rooftop,

01:15.988 --> 01:18.078
it was like
an aerial junkyard.

01:18.121 --> 01:21.559
Shards of glass, rusty bikes,
abandoned appliances.

01:21.603 --> 01:24.127
Apparently that was
the last time anyone was
up here, until yesterday.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.912
You mean, you planted
this garden by yourself
in one day?

01:26.956 --> 01:28.653
Well, super speed helps.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.481
James, we're frolicking
on our roof garden,
sipping mojitos.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.570
Could you try not
to look so miserable?

01:32.614 --> 01:34.137
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm just reading the internet.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.791
There's so many people
tweeting hate

01:35.834 --> 01:37.575
at the same time
praising Guardian.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.273
Okay. Well,
the internet is a cesspool.
You shouldn't read it.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.796
You know, I should make
a public statement

01:40.839 --> 01:42.580
and disavow any connection
to these people.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.104
Any statement will validate
the trolls, okay?

01:44.147 --> 01:46.758
Besides, all press
is good press.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.631
I don't see how
hate groups praising Guardian
could be good press.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.415
Now you see, I can, all right?

01:51.459 --> 01:53.417
These are people that
never would've read CatCo.

01:53.461 --> 01:56.159
And now because of Guardian,
they do.

01:56.203 --> 02:01.382
You've unwittingly crossed
the divide and that is the way
to affect change.

02:01.425 --> 02:03.688
-Maybe you're right.
Lena's always right.

02:04.428 --> 02:05.821
Mmm-hmm.

02:05.864 --> 02:07.692
She's very sagacious.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.651
Little boxes.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.827
Brainy, how many of those
have you had to drink?

02:11.870 --> 02:13.307
-Uh-huh.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.222
Twelve.

02:15.265 --> 02:19.182
You see, James, the ginger
root kicks the booty
of the immune system.

02:19.226 --> 02:23.404
It also strangely
makes the roof spin.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.495
Long live the Legion.

02:27.538 --> 02:28.931
Well, it's nice
to see you so happy, Kara.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.541
The sun is shining, the...

02:30.585 --> 02:32.326
Look, the Dar-Essa flower
is even blooming.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.371
What is there to be
upset about?

02:34.415 --> 02:38.201
Um, Haley starts working
full time at the DEO tomorrow.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.377
Got it. That's...
That's a good reason.

02:40.421 --> 02:43.380
She's explicitly here
to curtail my authority.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.861
I mean, she's going to make
my life a nightmare.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.732
Speaking of nightmares, guys.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.256
-So Brainy's drunk.
-Oh!

02:49.299 --> 02:51.780
He thought the mojitos
were a vegetable juice.

02:51.823 --> 02:54.348
Did someone say
mojitos at brunch?

02:54.391 --> 02:55.697
Sounds like my kind of party.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.525
Yeah. So glad you made it.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.614
-Uh, everyone this is Nia.
Ah!

02:59.657 --> 03:01.877
These are my people. J'onn.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.965
-This is Lena.
-Hello.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.271
-That's my sister, Alex.
-Hi.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.360
Well, CatCo's newest addition.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.883
It's very nice
to finally meet you.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.233
-We've heard a lot about you.
-All good things, I hope.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.104
Well, James said your passion

03:12.148 --> 03:13.410
for making the world
a better place is matched

03:13.454 --> 03:15.804
only by the elegance
of your prose, so...

03:15.847 --> 03:17.240
I wish I could say I paid him,

03:17.284 --> 03:18.807
but I could not have
made that up.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.070
I guess you should just take
the compliment then, huh?

03:21.113 --> 03:22.419
Where's Brainy?

03:22.463 --> 03:25.074
He actually is passed out
under an azalea tree.

03:25.117 --> 03:28.120
-Okay, I'll go find him.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.905
And as long as I'm dishing
out compliments,

03:29.948 --> 03:34.301
I wanna commend Kara
for landing an interview
with Amadei Derros,

03:34.344 --> 03:36.128
who has not given one
in over 20 years.

03:36.172 --> 03:39.654
Thank you, but I think
J'onn should get
the credit on that one.

03:39.697 --> 03:42.570
Amadei is a friend,
but it was hearing why
you wanted to talk

03:42.613 --> 03:44.267
that convinced him
to do the interview.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.747
Who is this Amadei?

03:45.790 --> 03:47.749
An alien healer.

03:47.792 --> 03:51.274
He's devoted his entire life
to helping aliens,
spiritually and physically

03:51.318 --> 03:53.189
Uh, the interview is tomorrow,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.974
but I could use someone's
help to get the perspective
of his acolytes.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.193
I would love to.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.762
Well, I woke him
and apparently he's fine.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.025
One of my superior
capabilities is recovering

04:03.068 --> 04:06.202
from alcohol libation
with remarkable speed.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.726
Are there any more
scones left? Nia Nal!

04:10.989 --> 04:14.384
-Well, we met once
at a pizza place.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.821
You know, you never found me.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.649
But, of course, I did.

04:18.693 --> 04:21.478
Your address
is 775 Gladiola Drive,
second floor corner apartment.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.959
Your phone number is 555-8010.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.656
You stop at Bob's Diner
every morning

04:25.700 --> 04:29.791
and order an extra super large
coffee, milk. No sugar.

04:29.834 --> 04:33.664
Okay. Yes, that...
He's not nearly as stalkery
as that just came out as.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.319
Well, why didn't you call?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.714
You told me to find you,
not call you.

04:41.672 --> 04:46.068
I'd like to make a toast.
Here, uh, a toast
to good friends,

04:46.111 --> 04:47.809
new and old.

04:47.852 --> 04:51.726
To health and happiness
and basking in the sunshine.

04:51.769 --> 04:54.337
Health and happiness.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.861
The pain...

05:00.082 --> 05:01.170
Jensen.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.998
What did you do to me?

05:03.041 --> 05:06.567
It was intended
as a gift.

05:06.610 --> 05:10.788
It hurts.
Everything hurts.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.662
Come with me.

05:14.705 --> 05:17.752
Don't come
any closer, I'm warning you.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.538
Reach your hand out.

05:23.714 --> 05:24.715
No!

05:26.064 --> 05:28.980
Stop! Stop!

05:43.081 --> 05:44.474
I have his powers?

05:44.518 --> 05:49.261
That's right. You can absorb
any alien's abilities

05:49.305 --> 05:53.135
and utterly destroy the alien
in the process.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.266
I can do that?

05:54.310 --> 05:55.485
That's right, my friend.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.009
And that makes you
the most valuable asset

05:58.053 --> 05:59.881
in the war to save humanity.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.380
Director Danvers, a word.

06:21.685 --> 06:24.993
Interpreting tone
is not my strong suit.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.995
But I sense this is not good.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.954
Thanks.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.957
-Colonel.
-Director Danvers.

06:33.001 --> 06:36.613
I've noticed you reorganized
the strike team command
and control system.

06:36.657 --> 06:37.832
I did.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.834
Are you aware that system
has been in place

06:39.877 --> 06:41.662
since the DEO's inception?

06:42.010 --> 06:43.533
Yes.

06:43.577 --> 06:46.971
But with all due respect,
the system was outmoded.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.451
It used to take us 90 seconds

06:48.495 --> 06:49.800
to get out the door
after first alert.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.150
And now by retasking
two analysts--

06:52.194 --> 06:53.848
You cut out the middle men

06:53.891 --> 06:56.677
and reduced deployment time
to 60 seconds,

06:56.720 --> 06:58.853
which could be the difference
between life and death.

06:59.723 --> 07:00.942
Exactly.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.248
So?

07:03.292 --> 07:05.555
I'm commending you,
Director Danvers.

07:05.599 --> 07:08.340
Any sign of our traitor
Agent Jensen?

07:08.384 --> 07:09.472
Not yet.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.995
But our facial
recognition algorithm

07:11.039 --> 07:12.388
is scanning National City.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.347
So the moment Jensen shows
his face, we'll get him.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.175
Keep up the good work.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.873
Yes, ma'am.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.923
Excuse me. Sorry.

07:31.886 --> 07:32.756
Ms. Danvers.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.541
-Oh, hi.
-My name is Cassian.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.586
I work with Amadei.
He's expecting you.

07:43.245 --> 07:44.725
Give me
your hand, son.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.234
You've declined interviews
for decades,

08:16.278 --> 08:19.716
but you've graciously agreed
to speak with me today.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.935
Why now?

08:20.978 --> 08:24.765
I see what is happening
to our country.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.768
Divisiveness
and discrimination.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.987
If we want to fight prejudice,

08:30.031 --> 08:34.426
people need to know
about who we are as aliens
and what we do.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.125
To lead as an example
for others,

08:38.953 --> 08:40.432
I must be seen.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.435
It's not comfortable for me.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.916
But comfort is not
my priority right now.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.484
I'm sure your example
will inspire many.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.749
You've saved countless
lives with your gift.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.273
Is it true your
healing abilities

08:55.317 --> 08:56.753
don't work on humans?

08:56.797 --> 09:00.191
As of yet, my frequency
cannot reach humans.

09:02.803 --> 09:08.156
But it is my greatest wish
to heal the human heart.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.943
Just last week
a carnival was attacked.

09:12.987 --> 09:16.294
A carnival! By vicious aliens
who broke out of prison.

09:16.338 --> 09:19.471
We're talking kids eating cotton candy on Ferris wheels.

09:19.515 --> 09:22.474
They weren't safe.
What did the government
do about it?

09:22.518 --> 09:24.564
Oh, they stepped in, sure.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.392
To protect the aliens,
who killed at least
two human beings.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.655
-And only Guardian...
-Okay.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.309
You have got to stop
listening to this dreck.

09:31.353 --> 09:32.920
Is that Ben Lockwood?

09:32.963 --> 09:33.921
Do you know him?

09:33.964 --> 09:35.400
Well, when I reorganized
L-Corp,

09:35.444 --> 09:37.577
I took my business away
from his father's steel shop

09:37.620 --> 09:39.622
and gave it to
an Nth metal producer.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.406
Who the hell gave
him a platform?

09:41.450 --> 09:44.192
The People's Veritas,
some sort of syndicated
fringe website.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.236
Oh, okay. Well, there you go.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.455
Fringe being
the operative word.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.978
Well, the last time
I saw Ben Lockwood,

09:48.022 --> 09:50.677
he was a sad, angry man
begging me to write his story.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.548
Now, he and every
lunatic like him

09:52.592 --> 09:54.376
is praising Guardian
as if I'm one of them.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.770
Well, I don't think the Mayor
would invite James Olsen

09:56.813 --> 09:58.946
to be the keynote speaker
at his Annual Media Summit

09:58.989 --> 10:00.861
if he thought he was some
kind of fringe lunatic.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.906
-The invitation just came in.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.342
That is what I came
to tell you.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.736
Now, you need to stop
obsessing about these trolls

10:06.780 --> 10:08.172
and start writing your speech.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.697
It's Jensen.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.221
He's been located
at the National City
Promenade.

10:13.264 --> 10:16.877
This is your collar, Danvers.
Go get him.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.967
Supergirl, it's time
to rumble.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.796
[people cheering
and applauding]

10:51.302 --> 10:53.783
I don't care what anyone says,
I love shapeshifters.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.614
What about your, sir?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.312
Would you like to come
face

11:03.967 --> 11:06.143
Why don't you pick on
someone your own shape?

11:20.723 --> 11:23.117
Alex, it's not just Jensen.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.336
He's been infected
by Parasite.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.052
Don't worry,
I'll make this quick.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.010
Freeze!

11:49.709 --> 11:51.362
Agents, get him. Go, go, go.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.103
-No!

11:59.196 --> 12:02.504
He shapeshifted.
Don't let him
out of your sight.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.079
Director Danvers, we lost him.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.602
Damn it.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.430
You all right?

12:19.390 --> 12:23.046
You neglected
to inform me that Agent Jensen
is not a human.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.700
He is.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.746
Well, he was.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.010
When Mercy and Otis
broke into the DEO,

12:30.053 --> 12:32.621
they took with them
a creature called Parasite.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.841
And once this parasite
infects a host,

12:34.884 --> 12:37.844
which in this case,
was Jensen,

12:37.887 --> 12:41.848
the host has the ability
to suck the life force out
of whoever it touches.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.197
Leaving that person dead.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.026
And if it's an alien,
absorbing their powers.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.071
We're very lucky
he didn't have more contact
with Supergirl.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.943
And we're lucky the host
doesn't have the ability

12:49.986 --> 12:52.119
to retain the powers
it absorbs.

12:52.162 --> 12:55.209
So, we'll try to get Jensen
when he's at his weakest.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.124
And how do we do that?

12:57.167 --> 13:00.040
The last time we overloaded
his system with nuclear
energy. Plutonium.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.564
I'll contact the Pentagon
about gathering
nuclear material.

13:02.607 --> 13:05.828
And I'll speak with Supergirl.
This is one monster
she can't fight.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.091
Very wise, Director Danvers.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.231
Hey, what are you doing?
You should be resting.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.450
You know when I made
a toast to the sunshine,

13:19.494 --> 13:20.843
I didn't realize
how apt that was.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.106
But I'm fully charged
from the sunlamps,

13:23.150 --> 13:26.327
and I'm ready to get out there
and take down Parasite.

13:29.591 --> 13:30.853
I'm not going out there, am I?

13:30.897 --> 13:33.029
We both know the danger
that Parasite poses.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.815
That he can kill me
and get supercharged
at the same time?

13:35.858 --> 13:37.599
Yes, I get it.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.035
But that doesn't mean
I don't wanna go out
there and fight him.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.602
I know you're frustrated
by this.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.431
I know. It's okay, Alex.

13:44.519 --> 13:48.653
Most people only have
one way to fight for justice

13:48.697 --> 13:51.395
but luckily, I have two.

13:51.439 --> 13:52.657
Power of the press.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.181
So I'll write
and file my article.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.748
But if there's
any other situation,

13:56.792 --> 13:58.315
alien or otherwise--

13:58.359 --> 13:59.490
I know who to call.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.976
Something's wrong.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.587
I touch them
and I get a rush of power.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.980
But then it fizzles.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.329
Well, then find another.
You need to keep feeding.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.419
I can't move fast enough
to keep myself powered.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.507
Help me.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.944
All right.

14:17.987 --> 14:20.772
Raymond,
The Children of Liberty,
our reach is long,

14:20.816 --> 14:24.211
I will cast a net
and we will find a solution.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.387
Humans don't let humans down.

14:27.388 --> 14:28.563
I promise.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.175
Kara, your article
made such an impact.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.569
These comments are incredible.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.353
Look at this one.

14:36.397 --> 14:41.402
"I wish my husband
was as kind as Amadei.
#Iwanttomarryanalien."

14:41.445 --> 14:42.882
Oh, my God.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.622
What?

14:44.666 --> 14:47.712
Let's skip that one.
There'll always be
a couple of bad apples.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.192
No, no. Look, there's more.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.891
"Roaches healing each other
just spreads the vermin.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.589
Kill Amadei, kill them all."

14:55.764 --> 14:58.723
Listen, most of them
were kind.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.943
But the others are so violent.

15:00.987 --> 15:05.426
I thought showing Amadei
as the great man he is,
would bring people together.

15:07.994 --> 15:11.606
One day, last month,
I woke up.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.261
I woke up,

15:14.304 --> 15:17.438
I brushed my teeth
and I decided

15:17.481 --> 15:20.136
I don't feel like using
my image-inducer today.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.226
I walked out to my local diner
to grab some coffee

15:23.270 --> 15:25.446
and there was a new waitress.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.188
She was cute.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.582
Human.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.281
When she handed me my check,
she'd written a note.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.025
"I'm an alien too."

15:39.982 --> 15:41.418
And she left me her number.

15:41.462 --> 15:44.552
I've seen Miranda every day
since, and guess what?

15:45.988 --> 15:48.121
She stopped using her inducer.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.689
That's an inspiring
story, Miles.

15:51.733 --> 15:52.952
Thank you so much for sharing.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.257
Thanks. Thanks, guys.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.955
Hey, look, I know it
hasn't been easy,

15:55.998 --> 15:59.132
us continuing this group
without Fiona, but, um...

15:59.175 --> 16:01.569
I, for one,
am happy that we did.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.311
Thank you.

16:06.487 --> 16:07.488
Thank you.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.100
J'onn.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.972
Cassian, what is it?

16:13.015 --> 16:14.538
It's Amadei.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.715
My God!

16:17.759 --> 16:21.197
I gave him tea,
as always, last night
before bed.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.851
I retired to my chamber.

16:22.894 --> 16:26.333
This morning when
I came to wake him,
the amulet was gone.

16:26.376 --> 16:29.031
J'onn, I came as soon as
I got your message.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.119
What happened?

16:30.163 --> 16:31.686
He's dying, Kara.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.129
He cannot survive
without the amulet.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.088
-We should call the police.
-No.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.830
Our community doesn't
trust the police.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.833
There is too much prejudice
against us, right now.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.575
But, J'onn, I've been told

16:51.619 --> 16:55.188
by many people that you have
a gift for solving crimes.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.843
Would it be all right if I try
to read Amadei's mind?

16:58.887 --> 17:00.062
Of course.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.078
-No one I recognize.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.688
What does it mean, J'onn?

17:17.732 --> 17:20.082
It's possible that she
was the last person
who saw him,

17:20.126 --> 17:21.214
that she cut out the amulet.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.259
Well, how do we identify her?

17:26.262 --> 17:27.698
Let me get this straight.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.397
You want me to run a facial
recognition search of you.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.789
Correct.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.095
I fear something is getting
lost in translation.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.792
You see, my satellite tells me

17:34.836 --> 17:36.751
the exact coordinates
of your location at this
very instant.

17:36.794 --> 17:41.625
So running a facial
recognition search would be
the very definition of red--

17:41.799 --> 17:42.800
Oh!

17:43.845 --> 17:45.151
That's another
matter entirely.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.109
-Run the algorithm.
-Yes, ma'am.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.458
Sir.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.121
Ah, that was quick.
Elizabeth Hawkings,

17:59.165 --> 18:01.950
21670, Cornelian Road.

18:01.993 --> 18:04.170
Elizabeth Hawkings' house.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.606
Looks like she's home.

18:05.649 --> 18:06.694
Hmm.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.261
Do you think
the amulet's in there?

18:08.304 --> 18:11.307
If it is, I will be
able to sense it.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.875
I'll meet you out here
in ten minutes.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.181
Yeah.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.497
Can I help you?

18:27.541 --> 18:29.804
I'm Kara Danvers.
I'm a reporter
with CatCo Magazine.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.240
Never heard of it.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.199
Sorry to bother you
in the middle of the day,

18:33.242 --> 18:34.809
but I'm doing an article
on the changing neighborhoods
of National City.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.158
Sorry, I was just
in the middle of something.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.160
And I thought
you were a package, so...

18:38.204 --> 18:40.162
Well, actually... Sorry.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.643
Uh, an interview will
only take a few minutes,

18:42.686 --> 18:44.384
-I promise.
What's
your article about?

18:44.427 --> 18:46.386
All right,
I said it's the, uh,

18:46.429 --> 18:48.301
changing neighborhoods
of National City,

18:48.344 --> 18:51.304
and I figured this one
was one of those.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.306
I don't really know
if I can help you.

18:53.349 --> 18:56.352
Do you go
to everyone's houses
or am I just on your hit list?

19:00.051 --> 19:01.401
What the hell are you
doing in my house?

19:01.444 --> 19:03.098
Don't be alarmed.
I'm not here to hurt you.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.839
Elizabeth, call the police!

19:04.882 --> 19:06.014
Get away from my mother!

19:06.057 --> 19:07.276
No, he's not gonna hurt her.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.669
And who are you?

19:08.712 --> 19:09.713
Both of you, get out!

19:09.757 --> 19:11.541
Elizabeth Hawkins.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.022
We have reason to believe
you may have seen
Amadei Derros last night.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.067
Amadei Derros?

19:16.111 --> 19:17.504
Why would I have seen him?
I don't know him.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.332
He was attacked last night.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.508
Someone took an amulet
that keeps him alive.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.858
My daughter would
never attack anyone.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.034
I was at work all night,
and then I went home
with my boyfriend.

19:26.077 --> 19:29.385
You were the last person
on Amadei's mind before
he was attacked.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.214
That's impossible.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.694
I promise you.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.913
Amadei would never have
thought about me.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.395
He's my father,
and I've never
even met the man.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.052
Amadei is your father?

19:44.095 --> 19:45.575
Deadbeat father.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.883
He's never even seen her.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.973
He and I had a one night stand
a million years ago.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.715
I thought we had a connection,

19:54.758 --> 19:58.066
but when I told him
I was pregnant,

19:58.109 --> 19:59.937
he shut the door in my face.

20:01.287 --> 20:04.115
He said he'd never even
acknowledge the child.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.465
Well, he did think about her.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.555
You were at the forefront
of his mind.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.252
It must've been somebody else.

20:12.123 --> 20:15.736
I wrote him every year,
sent him photos, drawings,

20:15.779 --> 20:19.653
even a stupid book report
in the ninth grade.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.003
He never responded.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.441
I'm no one to him.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.835
Look
what you've done.

20:27.878 --> 20:28.966
Dredging him up.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.795
I want you out.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.667
I'm sorry.

20:37.453 --> 20:38.846
He was thinking of you.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.978
Somehow, you're connected
to what's happened to him.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.859
Help me.

20:51.902 --> 20:52.947
I'm shriveling up.

20:52.990 --> 20:56.124
No, you won't.

20:56.167 --> 21:00.171
Because a Child of Liberty
has come forward
with a solution.

21:00.215 --> 21:03.479
And with it, you will be able
to take the invaders' powers

21:03.523 --> 21:05.307
and never lose them.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.570
You will become invincible.

21:07.614 --> 21:11.879
The human weapon that
will rid this planet
of all roaches.

21:13.054 --> 21:15.839
Mankind's true hero.

21:15.883 --> 21:19.843
Plutonium is in short supply,
but I found a stored uranium.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.018
It's en route.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.194
Uranium is less stable
than plutonium.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.022
We run the risk
of a bigger explosion.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.850
We need to get Jensen
to an isolated area.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.375
Or we need to find a way
to contain the explosion.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.333
Tell me what you're thinking.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.075
Well, an electrical force
field could stop the radiation
from the blast.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.469
Can you create one on the fly?

21:36.512 --> 21:38.862
An improvised ionic
containment, that could work.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.168
Spherical,

21:40.211 --> 21:42.344
to get the optimal
distribution of electrons.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.911
Like a dome.
Yes, it's elegant.

21:43.954 --> 21:46.348
You need something
of your own,
some sort of weapon.

21:46.392 --> 21:47.697
A proton pack.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.351
Perhaps as a blast gun.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.179
Agent Dox, is there
something you can create?

21:52.354 --> 21:54.356
Yes, yes, I...
I absolutely can.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.053
I can... I can use
some force field discs

21:56.097 --> 21:57.751
and link them together
into a force field matrix.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.579
I can also outfit a gun
to blast--

21:59.622 --> 22:01.581
We get it. You're hired.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.931
We make a good team.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.937
This is exhilarating to watch.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.163
[people chattering
indistinctly]

22:20.426 --> 22:22.906
I'm looking at the cause
more than the candidate.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.778
-It's a good cause.
James Olsen.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.955
I was hoping
I would find you here.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.006
Um, I was just, uh...

22:36.050 --> 22:37.573
My table's in the back.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.749
I doubt we're seated
at the same table.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.272
And this event
is for members of...

22:41.316 --> 22:42.665
The mainstream media, yeah.

22:42.709 --> 22:43.797
That's probably why
they seated me at the back.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.930
Um, listen, I owe
you two an apology.

22:46.974 --> 22:50.804
I wasn't in the best place
when last our paths crossed,

22:50.847 --> 22:54.285
but, uh, well, things...
Things are much better.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.766
Excuse me,
I'm gonna get a drink.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.159
See you in a few minutes.

22:58.202 --> 22:59.552
Make that two, please.

23:03.164 --> 23:06.863
Uh, you know, I was just
talking about you
on my show recently.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.648
So I heard.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.824
And just to be clear,
you and I do not
represent the same things.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.435
Far be it from James Olsen

23:13.479 --> 23:15.872
to listen to an opinion
that is not his own.

23:15.916 --> 23:18.309
I listen to opinions
that are not my own.

23:18.353 --> 23:21.312
But what I heard in your show
was full of discrimination
and hate.

23:21.356 --> 23:22.836
And that's when
I stopped listening.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.620
I see, so this is the part
where you and others like you

23:24.664 --> 23:26.796
start making crass
generalizations

23:26.840 --> 23:28.624
based on ignorance
and stereotype.

23:28.668 --> 23:31.018
And you forgot the part
where people like me
walk away.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.847
James, listen, I...

23:33.890 --> 23:36.676
I apologize again.
This is not the way
I wanted this to go.

23:36.719 --> 23:39.330
People are concerned, James.

23:39.374 --> 23:40.854
People have alien whiplash.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.334
I mean, I understand,
the Super cousins,

23:43.378 --> 23:44.901
they protect us, kind of.

23:46.076 --> 23:49.645
But the last three disasters
this country has seen,

23:49.689 --> 23:51.386
they've all been
of alien origin.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.779
Now, Guardian...

23:52.822 --> 23:54.476
Guardian, that's what
I wanna talk to you about.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.347
That is a symbol
of human hope.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.479
I want no part of that.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.134
Do not shut
these people out, James.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.093
Can't you see?

24:03.137 --> 24:05.879
The people who think this way,
they're not crazy,
they're scared.

24:05.922 --> 24:08.447
And they need
those fears acknowledged.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.926
And when they're not,

24:09.970 --> 24:12.712
when they get shut down
like you're doing right now,

24:14.714 --> 24:19.545
it just... It drives them
deeper into darkness.

24:21.808 --> 24:24.724
Let me be very clear
about something, Professor.

24:26.073 --> 24:29.076
You will not lay this
at my feet.

24:31.818 --> 24:34.690
Thanks, Cassian.
I'm sure Amadei
could feel their prayers.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.562
It'll help them hold on.

24:36.605 --> 24:40.087
Just know we're doing all
we can to find that amulet
and make him safe.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.441
Word has spread
of Amadei's attack.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.574
There's a vigil forming
outside his home.

24:49.618 --> 24:52.273
All right. I've got
pepperoni and mushroom.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.448
Alex, what are you doing here?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.102
What's going on with Jensen?

24:55.145 --> 24:57.191
Um, he's gone quiet.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.280
Which is unsettling, I know.

24:59.323 --> 25:02.544
But it gave me enough time
to get some sustenance
for you both.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.547
Kara texted me
about what happened,

25:05.591 --> 25:07.114
and I'm sorry about
your friend, J'onn.

25:07.157 --> 25:09.508
Turns out I didn't
know him all that well.

25:09.551 --> 25:12.336
I made a tactical mistake
in my reporting.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.729
What are you talking about?

25:13.773 --> 25:15.514
I was so certain
Amadei was a great man.

25:15.557 --> 25:19.692
I published this glowing
article making him out
to be a saint.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.129
But if I dug a little deeper,

25:22.172 --> 25:24.218
I may have discovered
how flawed he is.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.481
How would that information
have changed anything, Kara?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.483
My portrait of him
as immaculate

25:28.527 --> 25:30.050
may have put a target
on his back.

25:31.225 --> 25:34.315
I always try to believe
in the best in people,

25:34.358 --> 25:36.796
and so much the time,
it just seems to make
things worse.

25:36.839 --> 25:40.147
Kara, I usually expect
the worst in people,

25:40.190 --> 25:42.845
and that's no better.

25:42.889 --> 25:45.805
I was convinced for sure
that Haley was gonna be
a monster,

25:45.848 --> 25:48.677
but instead, she's been
very reasonable

25:48.721 --> 25:50.505
and deeply supportive.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.854
Okay.

25:53.682 --> 25:54.988
Okay.

25:55.031 --> 25:57.512
Well, we started
with the assumption

25:57.556 --> 25:59.340
that Amadei was spotless.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.995
Let's retrace our steps.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.388
Amadei
hasn't given an interview
in over 20 years,

26:04.432 --> 26:07.522
but let's see what he said
the last time he did
speak to the press.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.871
Mmm. Hey.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.221
-Lexus Nexus.

26:11.265 --> 26:13.659
Wow, Amadei gave lots
of interviews then,

26:13.702 --> 26:15.399
over the course of many years.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.360
And look who's next to him

26:19.403 --> 26:20.491
in all of them.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.452
A woman who claimed
to have met him only once.

26:27.411 --> 26:28.674
You two.

26:28.717 --> 26:31.198
You ruined my daughter.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.939
She read your article.

26:33.983 --> 26:37.117
"Amadei's goal was
to heal the human heart."

26:37.160 --> 26:41.643
You mean the alien heart,
because I'm human,

26:41.687 --> 26:43.297
and he broke mine.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.907
And you took it out
on your daughter
by keeping them apart.

26:44.951 --> 26:48.084
I never wanted her
to know about him.

26:48.128 --> 26:50.913
But then she found out
from my sister
and started writing him.

26:50.957 --> 26:55.222
Yes, yes, I made sure
that she never got a response.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.703
You think that I would
let him get into her head

26:57.746 --> 26:59.269
after how he ruined me?

27:03.752 --> 27:05.406
The image in Amadei's mind

27:05.449 --> 27:08.452
came from Elizabeth's
letters to her father.

27:08.496 --> 27:09.976
He wrote back, didn't he?

27:10.019 --> 27:12.065
After you two left,
she tore the house apart.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.154
Found where I hid his letters.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.809
She said that
I betrayed her.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.420
I made her deny
the alien part of her,

27:19.463 --> 27:22.336
which made her feel like
even more of an outcast.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.774
The Children of Liberty
are right.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.777
All roaches do
is bring misery.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.126
What are you saying?

27:30.953 --> 27:32.738
Who are the
Children of Liberty?

27:32.781 --> 27:35.697
A group of people who know

27:35.741 --> 27:38.744
our country is overrun
with aliens,

27:38.787 --> 27:41.007
and it's time to fight back.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.792
They needed help online,
I answered.

27:45.315 --> 27:46.708
We need the amulet.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.536
You will only hurt
your daughter more

27:48.579 --> 27:49.668
if you let her father die.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.626
I... I gave it
to a Child of Liberty.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.149
For what?

27:53.193 --> 27:56.762
To give it to a human who
can take away a roach's power,

27:56.805 --> 27:58.328
turn it into a husk.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.374
Jensen.

28:00.417 --> 28:03.464
Alex, the amulet.
Elizabeth's mother stole it.

28:03.507 --> 28:06.641
She gave it to Jensen
so he could keep the powers
he's been taking.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.729
How did the mom even know?

28:07.773 --> 28:09.949
She found it on the dark web.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.299
A group called
Children of Liberty.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.692
An alien-absorbing human

28:13.735 --> 28:15.781
with an agenda to kill
as many aliens as possible

28:15.824 --> 28:17.783
and absorb as many
powers as possible,

28:17.826 --> 28:19.828
thereby making
himself invincible.

28:19.872 --> 28:23.223
I believe the most logical
place for him to show up next
would be...

28:23.266 --> 28:24.398
Amadei's vigil.

28:24.441 --> 28:25.529
We're on our way.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.332
Hey, buddy, you okay?

28:51.904 --> 28:53.253
Hey! This guy's dead!

28:53.644 --> 28:54.733
He's dead!

29:07.441 --> 29:08.485
What is that?

29:09.486 --> 29:11.967
Alex, we're here.
I don't see Jensen.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.274
But there's some
sort of disturbance.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.060
All right, I can see
a purple glow.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.149
Jensen's somewhere
in the middle of the black.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.718
All right, agents,
get into position.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.767
All right, team.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.595
I need your heads up
and low profile.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.119
We don't want a riot.

29:33.162 --> 29:35.904
If you see Jensen
skin-to-skin,
contact can be fatal,

29:35.948 --> 29:37.776
so do not engage.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.778
You leave that
to Director Danvers.

29:39.821 --> 29:40.909
Ready, Colonel?

29:40.953 --> 29:43.129
-Activate the dome.
-Enter the matrix.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.968
All right, boys,
let's find him.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.928
Domingo,
you're funny.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.625
And one of the saner
voices in our city.

30:01.669 --> 30:04.237
We need people like you
to provide us with balance.

30:04.498 --> 30:05.891
Maybe.

30:05.934 --> 30:07.936
But I'm starting to wonder
if we need less balance

30:07.980 --> 30:09.938
and more taking a stand.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.679
Especially when it comes
to the alien problem.

30:11.722 --> 30:14.334
I think we need to reassess
their value to society.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.120
But you're one of our
top centrist commentators.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.730
You're not one of those
fringe people like him.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.346
Maybe he's more of a centrist
than you want to admit.

30:42.710 --> 30:43.972
Ladies and gentlemen.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.453
I just got word
of a mass attack
in midtown.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.065
Well, I'm sure
Guardian will help.

30:51.719 --> 30:55.854
Well, what's a speech
when the city needs
its human hero?

30:55.897 --> 30:57.290
Isn't that right, Mr. Olsen?

31:07.953 --> 31:09.606
-Damn it.
Careful.

31:09.650 --> 31:12.566
Jensen has the amulet
and the powers
of a Valeronian.

31:35.937 --> 31:36.895
He's gone.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.026
Why didn't he overload?

31:38.070 --> 31:40.289
The amulet increased
his capacity

31:40.333 --> 31:42.248
to obtain power
more than expected.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.076
Danvers?

31:44.119 --> 31:45.947
Danvers, you need to increase
your cannon's power load.

31:45.991 --> 31:49.385
The increase needs to be
at least 550% in order
to be effective.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.387
Though an explosion
of that magnitude

31:51.431 --> 31:53.389
will kill everyone
inside the dome.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.304
Our operatives have
personal force fields.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.871
But what about everybody else?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.742
If Jensen gets out of the dome
with the power he has now,

31:58.786 --> 32:01.093
we'll have a lot more people
than that to worry about.

32:14.149 --> 32:15.455
Get down!

32:23.289 --> 32:24.943
Jensen has
overloaded the dome.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.640
I'm re-configuring
the power transits,

32:26.683 --> 32:30.339
but our matrix will collapse
in two minutes, 47 seconds.

32:32.341 --> 32:35.823
-I need to make sure
Amadei is protected.
-Go.

32:35.866 --> 32:38.869
Alex. Alex, people
are on the verge
of stampeding.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.351
Supergirl?
Are you inside that dome?

32:42.395 --> 32:44.179
I was in the neighborhood.

32:44.223 --> 32:45.876
She won't touch him.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.663
Brainy, I need you to open
a gap in the dome
away from Jensen.

32:49.706 --> 32:52.361
-I have to get these
civilians evacuated.
-Negative.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.363
Danvers, you need
to focus on the target.

32:54.407 --> 32:56.800
I am. Supergirl will
get them out.

32:57.888 --> 32:58.889
On it.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.458
The dome gap
is in place behind you.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.852
But the opening is only
big enough for you to
evacuate one person at a time.

33:04.895 --> 33:08.160
You have two minutes,
11 seconds before
the entire thing collapses.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.423
Ooh. Miss, if I may?

33:15.602 --> 33:17.430
Miss,
I can help you.

33:19.258 --> 33:20.563
Supergirl!

33:20.955 --> 33:21.956
Get behind me.

33:30.921 --> 33:31.922
Agent Jensen.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.405
There's no way out
of here for you.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.494
Shoot me.

33:38.538 --> 33:41.454
If I shoot you, Raymond,
then everybody in here dies,

33:42.107 --> 33:43.934
including you.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.371
And I know you
don't want that.

33:45.414 --> 33:46.894
I want to make
this country safe.

33:46.937 --> 33:49.592
You're not making anything
safer by doing this.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.248
Look at everybody.
Look how scared they are.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.556
And it's not just
aliens, Raymond.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.819
Thirty seconds.
-It's humans, too.

33:58.862 --> 34:00.821
Danvers, terminate him.

34:00.864 --> 34:04.607
Look, I know when
the President revealed
herself as an alien,

34:04.651 --> 34:06.783
you got scared.
A lot of people did.

34:06.827 --> 34:10.222
But don't let that fear
define who you are.

34:10.265 --> 34:12.485
Twenty seconds.
-I still see that agent

34:12.528 --> 34:14.182
that I wanted to mentor.

34:14.226 --> 34:18.099
I still see that agent
that I was proud
to call my colleague.

34:18.143 --> 34:22.451
I still see that good man

34:22.495 --> 34:26.281
who's scared,
but he's still in there.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.413
Ten seconds.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.458
Shoot him, Danvers.
That is an order.

34:29.502 --> 34:31.982
Surrender now, and you will
save everybody in here.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.464
Be the hero that
I know you are.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.251
Even if I give up,

34:39.294 --> 34:41.122
he's still out there.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.341
Who's "he"?

35:10.847 --> 35:11.848
I'm dreaming.

35:12.675 --> 35:13.720
No.

35:14.677 --> 35:15.852
I'm here.

35:17.593 --> 35:20.292
I'm so sorry
my mother hurt you.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.032
Because I broke her heart.

35:22.076 --> 35:24.818
I... I didn't mean to.

35:24.861 --> 35:29.736
And I never, ever
wanted to hurt you.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.349
My daughter.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.092
It's okay.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.530
I'm okay.

35:43.053 --> 35:47.145
My goal has always been
to heal the human heart.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.063
But it is the two of you

35:54.369 --> 35:56.632
who helped me to heal mine.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.902
Congratulations.
Thanks.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.214
Nice work, Director Danvers.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.782
Few casualties,
minimal property damage.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.218
Thank you. Thank you, Colonel.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.568
Um, which cell did you
put Jensen in?

36:19.612 --> 36:21.831
I'd like to ask him
a few questions.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.920
I sent him
to the desert facility,

36:23.964 --> 36:25.879
but he won't be talking.

36:25.922 --> 36:29.709
Apparently, the rapid
withdrawal of alien powers
flat-lined his brain.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.408
You did good work today.

36:33.452 --> 36:34.757
But the next time
I give you orders,

36:34.801 --> 36:36.063
I expect for you
to follow them.

36:37.151 --> 36:38.413
Yes, ma'am.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.067
But still, I have to say,

36:40.110 --> 36:43.462
it is much better to have you
in charge than that impostor,

36:43.984 --> 36:45.072
J'onn J'onzz.

36:47.161 --> 36:49.163
Excuse me?

36:49.207 --> 36:52.514
When we at the White House
learned about your former
director's true identity,

36:52.558 --> 36:54.516
I recommended his removal.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.693
He was trying to erode
the DEO's mission.

36:57.737 --> 37:01.044
Employing aliens
instead of catching them.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.830
All while pretending
to be someone he's not.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.183
I am glad
order's been restored,

37:09.227 --> 37:14.057
and we're heading towards
more civil, honest times.

37:17.844 --> 37:21.108
J'onn J'onzz is the one
who recruited me,

37:21.500 --> 37:22.631
promoted me,

37:22.675 --> 37:24.677
and taught me everything
that I know.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.723
He's my family.

37:27.767 --> 37:32.685
And he is the best director
this organization
has ever seen.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.862
J'onzz set a bad precedent.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.908
But we will set things right.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.476
From now on, we are
strictly by the book.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.304
Which means we are going
to act according to rank,

37:43.348 --> 37:45.045
and let's be clear
about yours.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.353
You might run this place,

37:48.396 --> 37:51.269
but I am your
superior officer.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.271
You report to me. Understood?

37:54.054 --> 37:55.229
Understood.

37:57.362 --> 37:58.841
Director Danvers,
when you exit,

37:58.885 --> 38:00.800
you salute your
ranking officer.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.241
Yes, ma'am.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.029
We'll work on that.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.162
I still believe
there's hope for you yet.

38:27.392 --> 38:28.480
I heard what happened
with Amadei.

38:28.523 --> 38:30.960
You solved the crime,
you saved him.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.701
I didn't so much
as solve the crime

38:32.745 --> 38:34.616
as solve the people behind it.

38:34.660 --> 38:37.227
Amadei deserved to know
his daughter,

38:37.271 --> 38:39.360
and she deserved to know
the truth, you know.

38:39.404 --> 38:43.059
Speaking of, a woman
came in earlier today
looking for you.

38:43.103 --> 38:44.539
A Mara Nalbeck?

38:44.583 --> 38:45.801
Said her stall got vandalized

38:45.845 --> 38:47.542
and wanted you to get
to the bottom of it.

38:47.586 --> 38:48.978
She left a number.

38:52.634 --> 38:55.942
Apparently, you're the guy
to go to when aliens can't
go to the police.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.395
You okay?

39:14.439 --> 39:17.616
Yeah, I'm just thinking
about everything we heard
at the media summit tonight.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.140
I know. It was so hateful.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.143
I didn't realize
how deep it went

39:23.186 --> 39:24.318
or how ugly it was.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.148
You were right
to want to disavow it.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.761
I'm not sure disavowal
is the right move.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.763
Something Ben Lockwood says
stuck with me.

39:34.807 --> 39:37.113
-Maybe you can't

39:37.157 --> 39:40.290
change people's minds
by slamming doors
in their faces.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.684
And as a reporter,
I need to get to the bottom
of this story

39:42.728 --> 39:44.164
to figure out
who these people are.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.166
Find their leader.

39:46.993 --> 39:48.777
Lena, you told me yourself.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.431
These people
are interested in Guardian

39:50.475 --> 39:51.998
so, maybe
they'll listen to me.

39:56.829 --> 39:58.221
That's the way forward.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.006
It sounds dangerous.

40:00.702 --> 40:02.312
You're kidding me?

40:02.356 --> 40:03.705
With you as my co

40:16.414 --> 40:18.024
Elizabeth said the article
I wrote on Amadei

40:18.067 --> 40:20.592
made her see him
in a different light.

40:20.635 --> 40:22.768
Understand the sacrifices
he made.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.987
That's fantastic.
You moved her.

40:25.466 --> 40:26.685
So?

40:26.728 --> 40:30.079
So, I've decided to do
a series of profiles

40:30.123 --> 40:32.691
called,
"Aliens of National City."

40:32.734 --> 40:34.867
We'll talk
to a different alien
every week,

40:34.910 --> 40:36.434
but not just the noted ones.

40:36.477 --> 40:37.870
They don't have to be saints.

40:37.913 --> 40:41.047
Aliens are just as flawed
as everyone else.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.441
But I... I think
telling their stories,

40:44.006 --> 40:45.965
or all sides of them,

40:46.008 --> 40:49.447
can still help heal
the divide in the city.

40:52.101 --> 40:54.408
That's actually the first time

40:54.452 --> 40:55.975
I've pitched it to anyone.

40:57.629 --> 40:58.934
What do you think?

40:59.761 --> 41:01.371
I think it's great.

41:27.833 --> 41:28.921
Ben?

41:28.964 --> 41:30.923
James Olsen. Hey.

41:30.966 --> 41:32.490
Hey, did I catch you
at a bad time?

41:32.533 --> 41:34.970
No, you just caught me
in the middle of
some car trouble.

41:35.014 --> 41:36.972
Look, I've been thinking
about what you said.

41:38.844 --> 41:39.932
Do you have time to talk?

41:39.975 --> 41:41.586
Do I have time to talk?

41:41.629 --> 41:44.023
Hey. For you, friend,

41:44.066 --> 41:45.503
I got all the time
in the world.

41:46.634 --> 41:47.983
What's on your mind?
