02:06.708 --> 02:08.875
<i>Sam? Just received a report...</i>

02:09.333 --> 02:11.791
<i>...attacked a village
near your location. Over.</i>

02:12.083 --> 02:12.958
Go ahead.

02:13.041 --> 02:15.458
<i>Satellite shows... heading south.</i>

02:15.541 --> 02:19.041
<i>Expect fleeing villagers traveling on foot
towards your location...</i>

02:30.666 --> 02:32.000
<i>Sam...</i>

02:32.083 --> 02:34.833
<i>Sam, do you copy? Over.</i>

02:56.125 --> 02:57.791
Wait out! Turn around! Go!

02:58.750 --> 03:00.416
Zero, this is four. Contact.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.791
Wait out. Hostile! Reverse!

03:04.541 --> 03:06.500
Golf alpha, requesting immediate evac.

03:06.583 --> 03:09.208
We are under attack.
I repeat, immediate evac.

03:09.291 --> 03:12.416
- <i>Copy that. Send location.
- </i> Location six-seven.

03:19.958 --> 03:21.416
Get in the back. Move!

03:22.750 --> 03:24.125
Move over. Fast!

03:46.750 --> 03:48.625
- Scream.
- Oh, my God.

03:48.708 --> 03:50.041
I... I can't.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.458
Help me! Please don't shoot me!

04:39.500 --> 04:41.333
Stop the vehicle! Stop!

04:42.458 --> 04:44.708
Get out of the car.
Get out of the fucking car. Get out!

04:44.791 --> 04:46.416
Move! Move! Move!

04:46.500 --> 04:47.916
Keep moving.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.500
Get down on your knees.
Get down! Get down!

04:51.083 --> 04:53.250
Sarah, Joe! Get out of the car.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.666
Get out! Move!

04:55.750 --> 04:58.208
Move! Faster! Move! Move!

04:58.958 --> 05:00.833
Move!

08:04.791 --> 08:07.583
You need to get ready, Zoe.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.707
We gather here today

08:32.791 --> 08:35.500
to celebrate the life of Eric Tanner.

08:35.832 --> 08:39.250
Who leaves behind his only daughter,
Zoe.

08:39.832 --> 08:44.500
She has had more tragedy to bear
than most at her young age.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.642
Eric was responsible

08:47.666 --> 08:49.000
for the lives of many...

08:49.875 --> 08:53.541
both with his business...
and extensive charity work.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.875
He also leaves behind his wife, Rima,

08:57.625 --> 09:01.125
with whom he shared ten wonderful years.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.458
I know you will join with me
in supporting them both at this time.

09:26.875 --> 09:31.000
<i>Friday, 5:58 p.m.</i>

09:31.708 --> 09:35.541
<i>Hello, my name is Derek Litman.
I'm with Allstate Farmers Life Insurance.</i>

09:35.625 --> 09:38.333
<i>Uh, the reason I'm calling today
is that we are offering...</i>

09:39.916 --> 09:41.583
<i>Hey, Sam. Justin.</i>

09:42.208 --> 09:44.208
<i>That drink. Give me a call.</i>

09:46.500 --> 09:48.583
<i>Hi, um...</i>

09:49.541 --> 09:52.458
<i>I don't... I don't know if this is the...</i>

10:08.208 --> 10:11.958
<i>Los Angeles, where any rain
is considered a newsworthy novelty,</i>

10:12.041 --> 10:17.541
<i>is caught in a genuine tropical downpour.
It's currently 75 degrees.</i>

10:17.625 --> 10:19.416
<i>Shareholders in Hassine Mining,</i>

10:19.500 --> 10:21.916
<i>concerned by the death
of CFO Eric Tanner,</i>

10:22.000 --> 10:24.208
<i>were reassured by a billion-dollar deal</i>

10:24.291 --> 10:27.125
<i>secured by his stand-in and widow,
Rima Hassine.</i>

10:27.583 --> 10:30.625
<i>Phosphate mining is known
as the white gold of Africa,</i>

10:30.708 --> 10:33.875
<i>a global industry fought over
between giants Sikong</i>

10:33.958 --> 10:35.500
<i>and rival, Hassine Mining.</i>

10:36.416 --> 10:38.833
<i>- Shares of Hassine Mining...</i>
- How did this leak?

10:39.208 --> 10:41.833
Look at the stock. It's stable.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.416
The deal's not done until it's signed.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.625
This will provide confidence
at a key time for us.

10:47.916 --> 10:50.333
It shows you have not been weakened
by Eric's death.

10:53.125 --> 10:56.041
Let the story run. Follow my advice.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.750
Bring my flight forward
to tomorrow morning.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.666
<i>...is worth over three billion dollars.</i>

11:06.416 --> 11:07.625
What do you want?

11:09.750 --> 11:10.750
Hi.

11:17.916 --> 11:19.250
How are you feeling?

11:20.916 --> 11:21.916
Pretty shitty.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.916
I know. Me, too.

11:28.666 --> 11:29.916
Where's Adam?

11:31.833 --> 11:32.958
Oh, you don't know?

11:34.625 --> 11:35.625
What?

11:36.416 --> 11:38.041
He requested a transfer.

11:41.125 --> 11:44.416
Zoe, the lawyers are waiting.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.375
Will you be all right?

11:46.458 --> 11:48.708
You're not gonna start pretending
you care about me?

11:48.875 --> 11:49.875
Oh, Zoe...

11:50.458 --> 11:52.000
Make yourself presentable.

12:02.125 --> 12:03.541
"I, Eric Tanner,

12:03.625 --> 12:06.166
hereby bequeath all my shares
in Hassine Mining...

12:06.250 --> 12:07.791
to Zoe Tanner."

12:08.958 --> 12:10.333
I will contest this.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.791
Eric wanted me
to present this to you personally.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.958
He felt you might need our... guidance.

12:17.041 --> 12:18.958
I can't believe he did this.

12:19.333 --> 12:22.267
There are some terms I need to run through
before we conclude this meeting.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.208
My family founded Hassine Mining.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.458
How much are they worth?

12:26.791 --> 12:28.375
The shares?

12:28.916 --> 12:32.166
Eric hoped that getting Zoe involved
in the company...

12:33.000 --> 12:34.291
would bring you closer.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.250
I don't have time for this.

12:37.791 --> 12:41.500
We anticipate it'll take three months
for the share transfer to go through.

12:41.583 --> 12:44.291
- So I can stay here for the summer?
- No, I need you with me.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.791
No. I hate it there.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.833
We can meet there
and discuss matters then.

12:47.916 --> 12:49.583
Ladies, look...

12:51.375 --> 12:52.541
Miss Tanner?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.333
We need to assign you
a new close protection officer.

12:55.416 --> 12:58.000
Well, seeing as she's coming
to the Azref residence next week,

12:58.083 --> 13:00.541
I'm assuming one of my team
can take it from there.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.250
Yeah, that will be fine.

13:02.791 --> 13:04.250
Find someone she can't fuck.

15:47.625 --> 15:48.791
Let's go.

16:05.625 --> 16:06.750
You coping?

16:06.958 --> 16:08.291
With what exactly?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.708
Work. Being based in an office.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.083
Must be hard.

16:23.208 --> 16:24.416
Looks cute.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.625
You still get off on dodging bullets?

16:27.916 --> 16:29.458
I had shitty intel.

16:30.416 --> 16:34.708
- You could do with a rest.
- That's none of your concern.

16:53.541 --> 16:55.875
So Rima Hassine was his second wife.

16:56.375 --> 16:58.333
Her real mother died when Zoe was ten.

16:59.083 --> 17:00.083
Suicide.

17:01.250 --> 17:02.250
Great.

17:03.291 --> 17:05.540
A rich kid with mommy issues.

17:27.415 --> 17:28.767
- Alik.
- Pleasure to meet you.

17:28.791 --> 17:31.666
You, too.
Sam, this is Hassine's head of security.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.250
Nice to meet you.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.726
I advised the family not to work
with your company again,

17:35.750 --> 17:38.333
but Madame Hassine wanted a woman.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.416
Happy to be of assistance.

17:42.083 --> 17:45.000
We don't have female CPOs in Morocco.

17:52.041 --> 17:55.208
Mr. Sinclair and Ms. Carlson.

17:55.958 --> 17:57.750
Am I supposed to know who you are?

17:58.625 --> 18:00.541
Ms. Carlson is Adam's replacement.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.041
Sam. Nice to meet you.

18:08.708 --> 18:11.666
Take him to the kitchen.
He needs to be fed.

18:13.375 --> 18:14.750
We leave in an hour.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.666
You might want to change.

18:20.250 --> 18:23.833
So they... hired me
because Adam was fucking her.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.559
Look at it this way.
They actually want a woman. It's progress.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.125
Who do you think you are? My mom?

19:35.166 --> 19:36.250
Of course not.

19:38.666 --> 19:41.666
- I could have you fired.
- Be my guest.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.375
I don't care
what you think about me.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.500
I don't think anything about you.

19:49.583 --> 19:50.875
I'll wait outside.

20:18.750 --> 20:23.583
<i>Our helicopter today
is 20 miles north. That's 1,500...</i>

20:28.375 --> 20:30.708
Have you been briefed
on the risk factors here?

20:32.458 --> 20:35.708
- Many times.
- Including kidnap for ransom?

20:35.791 --> 20:38.375
Look, they pretty much lock me away here.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.750
What happened to your face?

20:44.041 --> 20:45.041
Sorry?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.208
What happened to your face?

20:49.208 --> 20:50.208
Work.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.375
My inheritance.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.666
You should know there's been
a recent increase

21:15.750 --> 21:19.458
in high-net worth individuals
being targeted for kidnap and ransom.

21:20.416 --> 21:23.708
You're great company.
I'm really gonna miss you.

21:24.666 --> 21:27.375
Hassine Mining has
a very suitable replacement.

21:28.041 --> 21:30.166
Someone who knows the region better.

21:43.041 --> 21:44.625
You know what a "kasbah" means?

21:45.583 --> 21:46.583
No.

21:47.291 --> 21:48.750
Fortified house.

21:49.750 --> 21:52.958
<i>Prepare to land on helipad.</i>

21:56.458 --> 21:58.000
Welcome to my prison.

22:50.208 --> 22:51.208
Zoe.

22:51.708 --> 22:52.708
Where's Rima?

22:53.208 --> 22:55.708
She'll be a few days.
She's held up in the mines.

22:58.291 --> 22:59.958
We have a car on standby for you.

23:01.291 --> 23:02.916
No. She's staying for the night.

23:03.833 --> 23:07.041
Her contract is over.
She's heading to the airport.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.500
Her flight isn't till tomorrow morning.

23:10.208 --> 23:12.291
She still has 12 hours on the clock.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.208
You've been paid for it.

23:15.916 --> 23:16.916
Fine.

26:02.291 --> 26:03.541
Fuck.

26:26.375 --> 26:28.458
Tactical defenses active, sir.

26:28.916 --> 26:30.500
Get that camera back online.

26:36.416 --> 26:37.541
Can I help you?

26:37.625 --> 26:39.791
Was he like that when I took a shower?

26:42.916 --> 26:45.083
Abdel, take a break.

26:47.541 --> 26:50.250
There aren't as many boots on the ground
as I expected.

26:51.083 --> 26:53.166
This is a top-of-the-range safe house.

26:53.875 --> 26:55.708
It supersedes the need for manpower.

26:56.583 --> 26:57.750
You can relax.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.583
Just wanted to see your setup.

27:20.041 --> 27:21.500
You like what you see?

27:22.500 --> 27:24.666
My sexual preferences aren't women.

27:26.458 --> 27:27.458
Good night, Zoe.

27:57.333 --> 28:00.375
<i>Hi, it's... it's Beth.</i>

28:01.125 --> 28:04.125
<i>Um, I'm not sure
if this is the right number.</i>

28:04.458 --> 28:05.458
<i>Um...</i>

30:27.833 --> 30:29.517
Get down! Get down!

30:34.416 --> 30:35.541
What's in the walls?

30:35.875 --> 30:37.000
Shells.

30:37.375 --> 30:38.375
What the fuck?

30:40.958 --> 30:43.208
Go to Alik.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.625
Get access to the control room.

30:45.875 --> 30:48.583
Someone has taken over the system.
I'll go to Zoe.

31:12.958 --> 31:13.958
Open the door.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.333
<i>Be advised, hostile on exterior roof.</i>

31:16.416 --> 31:17.416
Copy.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.458
Approaching target.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.553
<i>Her door
is encrypted. Give me two minutes.</i>

32:01.583 --> 32:02.583
Copy.

32:04.708 --> 32:05.958
In position.

32:08.125 --> 32:11.250
Sam... Sam to Alik. Sam to Alik.
Do you copy?

32:11.625 --> 32:13.291
I need backup.

32:15.791 --> 32:18.208
Zoe? Zoe, it's Sam. I'm outside.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.458
Sam! Sam, what do I do?

32:21.541 --> 32:23.750
There are intruders.
If they're coming for you,

32:23.833 --> 32:25.916
they have to open the shutters
to get in to you.

32:26.125 --> 32:27.708
That will be your chance.

32:27.791 --> 32:30.416
I want you to get down low,
so you can roll out to me.

32:31.291 --> 32:33.500
Alik? Alik, do you copy?

32:35.166 --> 32:38.625
<i>I need backup.
I repeat, backup is needed on terrace C.</i>

32:38.708 --> 32:40.625
<i>Backup is needed...</i>

32:44.666 --> 32:46.916
Zoe, I need you to get ready.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.833
Sam, there won't be enough time.

32:48.916 --> 32:52.583
There is enough time,
so get down low, stay low, okay?

32:52.666 --> 32:55.458
As soon as the shutters open,
you roll out to me.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.791
<i>One minute.</i>

33:04.333 --> 33:05.333
Sam!

33:05.416 --> 33:07.250
I'm right here. I need you to stay calm.

33:23.125 --> 33:24.750
Sam! Sam!

33:26.791 --> 33:28.541
Mark in position. Open it up.

33:31.166 --> 33:34.125
Sam, the door's opening!
This is not opening! Sam!

33:34.208 --> 33:36.041
They will open. Just stay low.

33:36.125 --> 33:39.041
Okay.

33:39.791 --> 33:41.416
- Push!
- Sam!

33:44.000 --> 33:47.958
- Stay low!
- They're coming! Sam, they're coming!

33:48.625 --> 33:50.166
Come on. Come on!

33:52.041 --> 33:53.208
Where's the girl?

33:53.291 --> 33:55.041
- Fuck!
- This way.

34:00.208 --> 34:01.488
- Come on!
- My feet!

34:01.541 --> 34:03.583
We're nearly... We're nearly there.

35:00.250 --> 35:02.250
Thank God you were there.

35:29.583 --> 35:30.625
No phone, please.

35:44.583 --> 35:45.916
Where are you taking us?

35:47.041 --> 35:48.291
Police headquarter, madam.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.708
How much longer?

35:57.291 --> 35:58.875
English not good. Sorry.

36:05.583 --> 36:08.458
- Sam.
- Do you understand what they're saying?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.750
It's an address.
It's not the police station.

36:11.166 --> 36:12.875
And they're talking about money.

36:57.791 --> 36:59.041
Sam!

37:06.666 --> 37:08.583
Sam!

37:26.625 --> 37:28.166
Come on! Just come on!

37:53.666 --> 37:55.666
Hey.

38:11.541 --> 38:14.833
No passports. We got mugged.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.708
We can't stay here.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.041
I can't do this!

39:11.500 --> 39:12.583
You shot a cop.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.458
You made yourself a fugitive.

39:14.541 --> 39:16.833
He... He was gonna kill you.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.375
There was a reason I didn't use my gun.

39:30.166 --> 39:31.416
What is he saying?

39:36.458 --> 39:38.833
What is he saying?
Zoe, what is he saying?

39:39.416 --> 39:40.666
Calm down.

39:40.750 --> 39:42.208
You need to calm down.

39:42.291 --> 39:46.708
I... I... I...

39:47.500 --> 39:50.041
Calm down. Calm down. Look at me.

39:50.125 --> 39:52.125
Shh! Shh!

39:52.583 --> 39:54.583
Shh! Shh!

39:54.666 --> 39:57.666
Okay? No. Look at me. Look at me.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.333
Calm... Shh!

39:59.416 --> 40:00.458
Look at me.

40:00.750 --> 40:03.375
Good. Good. Okay. Shh!

40:03.458 --> 40:05.416
You're gonna... You're going to call Rima.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.875
She's gonna get you out.

40:08.208 --> 40:11.041
Okay? Okay?

40:11.625 --> 40:13.958
Good. Good.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.333
<i>Hassine Mining heiress, Zoe Tanner,</i>

40:23.416 --> 40:27.083
<i>who is set to inherit the entirety
of her late father's shares,</i>

40:27.166 --> 40:31.375
<i>is wanted for questioning over the death
of a local policeman in Casablanca.</i>

40:31.458 --> 40:34.833
<i>Hassine's stocks are already dropping
when they were forecast to increase</i>

40:34.916 --> 40:37.250
<i>in the run-up
to the signature of the deal.</i>

40:37.333 --> 40:40.833
<i>Madame Hassine will be joining us
on our business segment tomorrow.</i>

40:40.916 --> 40:42.416
Get Alik on the phone.

40:45.833 --> 40:46.833
Uh...

40:48.666 --> 40:50.041
He didn't make it.

40:52.666 --> 40:53.833
Who's left?

40:53.916 --> 40:56.666
Three or four men.
They are not contactable.

40:56.958 --> 40:58.750
We believe they may have taken bribes.

41:01.916 --> 41:02.916
Hello?

41:06.666 --> 41:07.708
Who is this?

41:10.208 --> 41:11.291
It's me.

41:11.583 --> 41:14.375
<i>I need your help.</i>

41:14.791 --> 41:16.833
Zoe, this is a huge mess.

41:18.250 --> 41:20.625
I'm in real trouble.

41:20.708 --> 41:22.625
Did you really kill that policeman?

41:27.250 --> 41:29.041
Yes.

41:30.833 --> 41:31.875
Were you high?

41:32.375 --> 41:35.125
No. No, of course not.
We were attacked.

41:35.208 --> 41:38.291
<i>Zoe, it's all over the news.
Our stocks are plummeting.</i>

41:38.375 --> 41:40.166
Are you serious right now?

41:40.375 --> 41:41.458
Someone tried to kill me,

41:41.541 --> 41:43.708
and you're worried
about your fucking shares?

41:44.583 --> 41:46.583
You know,
if your security hadn't been so shit,

41:46.666 --> 41:48.291
<i>I wouldn't be in this mess.</i>

41:48.708 --> 41:50.708
Alik died trying to protect you.

41:50.791 --> 41:52.250
That was his job!

41:54.625 --> 41:56.125
Zoe, that's enough, please.

41:56.208 --> 41:58.125
You don't even care about me!

41:58.625 --> 42:00.125
You never wanted me!

42:01.333 --> 42:03.434
You know, it's a good thing
you never could have kids,

42:03.458 --> 42:05.666
because I wouldn't wish you on anybody!

42:13.583 --> 42:14.791
Who else is there?

42:17.875 --> 42:18.875
No one.

42:24.250 --> 42:27.458
Your insurance policy dictates
you send in a team.

42:28.833 --> 42:30.666
I'm taking Zoe off the policy.

42:32.333 --> 42:33.708
Effective immediately.

42:51.583 --> 42:52.666
You're leaving.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.541
I'm going out
to get us some supplies.

42:57.833 --> 42:59.333
You won't come back.

43:07.750 --> 43:09.625
I'm gonna get you out of the country.

43:10.291 --> 43:12.125
You're not leaving me here?

43:12.833 --> 43:14.500
Let's get one thing straight.

43:15.083 --> 43:17.625
I no longer work for you
or the Hassines.

43:17.875 --> 43:21.541
So from now on,
you do as I say. Okay?

43:26.333 --> 43:27.416
Stay here.

43:31.791 --> 43:33.458
And don't open for anyone.

44:37.500 --> 44:38.625
<i>Good evening.</i>

44:38.708 --> 44:42.291
<i>Tonight, we will be talking
to Hassine Mining CEO Rima Hassine,</i>

44:42.375 --> 44:46.041
<i>and Watt Li,
the deputy CEO of Sikong Industries.</i>

44:46.500 --> 44:48.500
<i>Bids were placed by both companies</i>

44:48.583 --> 44:51.916
<i>to purchase over 6,000 hectares
of land in Zambia,</i>

44:52.000 --> 44:55.208
<i>speculated to have
the world's largest phosphate reserves.</i>

44:55.291 --> 44:58.250
<i>A dramatic fall in share prices
at Hassine Mining</i>

44:58.333 --> 45:01.791
<i>has led to speculation Sikong
could steal the deal from under them.</i>

45:01.875 --> 45:04.375
<i>The deadline for closing is tomorrow.</i>

45:05.375 --> 45:08.875
<i>Madame Hassine,
it's been a difficult few weeks for you.</i>

45:08.958 --> 45:11.875
<i>Is there anything you can say
to your shareholders</i>

45:11.958 --> 45:13.250
<i>that might reassure them?</i>

45:13.500 --> 45:16.208
<i>Hassine Mining is doing everything
in its power</i>

45:16.291 --> 45:18.875
<i>to cooperate
with the ongoing police investigation.</i>

45:18.958 --> 45:23.416
<i>I, personally, have had no contact
with Zoe, with... with Miss Tanner,</i>

45:23.500 --> 45:27.375
<i>and my message to her would be
to hand herself over to the authorities</i>

45:27.458 --> 45:29.500
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

45:29.958 --> 45:33.500
<i>Hassine Mining is having
one of its strongest years yet</i>

45:33.583 --> 45:37.958
<i>and is confident in completing
the Zambian phosphate deal tomorrow.</i>

45:38.541 --> 45:42.916
<i>Well, surely a governmental organization,
such as the Izwe Estate Group,</i>

45:43.000 --> 45:46.333
<i>they must have a code of ethics
they need to abide by.</i>

45:46.416 --> 45:49.791
<i>Uh, how can they justify proceeding
with Hassine Mining</i>

45:49.875 --> 45:51.500
<i>when you're under police investigation?</i>

45:51.583 --> 45:55.458
<i>Zoe Tanner is not a...
is... is not an employee of Hassine Mining.</i>

45:55.708 --> 45:59.083
<i>Has she not just inherited
a large proportion of the company?</i>

45:59.875 --> 46:03.583
<i>There are stipulations in place
that would prevent Zoe's inheritance</i>

46:03.666 --> 46:06.041
<i>during a police investigation
into manslaughter.</i>

46:06.125 --> 46:07.541
<i>Look, I see no reason</i>

46:07.625 --> 46:10.666
<i>why my stepdaughter's
personal circumstances</i>

46:10.750 --> 46:12.583
<i>should affect a business deal.</i>

46:12.666 --> 46:17.875
<i>What is Hassine Mining's policy
as regards to their code of ethics?</i>

46:20.708 --> 46:22.833
<i>Sikong is an international business,</i>

46:22.916 --> 46:26.500
<i>which adheres to strict policies
when it comes to our ethics code.</i>

46:26.583 --> 46:28.500
<i>As one of the fastest growing...</i>

46:33.291 --> 46:34.958
Oh, Mr. Kabila, how are you?

46:35.041 --> 46:37.833
<i>I'm afraid
we have to postpone our meeting.</i>

46:38.875 --> 46:40.541
I don't understand.
We were...

46:40.625 --> 46:42.333
We were set to sign tonight.

46:42.416 --> 46:44.250
<i>Oh, it can't come as a surprise.</i>

46:44.333 --> 46:47.541
<i>Zoe Tanner is set to inherit
a large proportion of your company.</i>

46:47.625 --> 46:50.041
Approval has been given
for the drilling sites.

46:50.125 --> 46:52.541
<i>She is wanted on a murder charge.</i>

46:53.250 --> 46:56.541
<i>Our board are concerned
about accepting your offer.</i>

46:58.333 --> 47:01.000
Is your board
reconsidering Sikong's offer?

47:01.083 --> 47:04.333
<i>You will need to increase your bid
if you want to remain in the deal.</i>

47:18.875 --> 47:21.583
- <i>Madame Hassine.</i>
- I've decided to proceed.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.958
Report only to me on this number.

47:26.125 --> 47:28.375
No one else in my organization.
Do you understand?

47:43.791 --> 47:45.291
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

47:50.916 --> 47:53.833
So, fingers under, just hold the top.

48:38.208 --> 48:42.583
Okay. Be still.

48:44.583 --> 48:45.875
Do you have kids?

48:48.333 --> 48:49.333
No.

48:50.458 --> 48:52.166
- Ah!
- Be still.

48:59.750 --> 49:01.166
I've organized an evac.

49:02.458 --> 49:04.916
My guy is sending someone to get us out.

49:05.500 --> 49:06.500
How?

49:06.583 --> 49:08.041
We drive to Tangiers...

49:08.791 --> 49:10.208
and take the ferry to Spain.

49:10.708 --> 49:13.291
Won't there be checkpoints?

49:14.833 --> 49:17.750
The guy they're sending
will bring us new passports...

49:18.166 --> 49:19.833
and he'll travel with us.

49:22.666 --> 49:23.916
As my husband.

49:24.791 --> 49:25.791
Your father.

49:29.416 --> 49:30.791
Here, put these on.

49:31.791 --> 49:34.000
Don't take them off.
You sleep in them, okay?

49:34.291 --> 49:36.416
You have the worst taste in shoes.

50:43.250 --> 50:44.500
That's enough.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.166
Where are we?

51:11.291 --> 51:13.500
We think they're somewhere
in Mellah district.

51:13.583 --> 51:15.500
How many men have you got on this job?

51:16.583 --> 51:19.375
Madame Hassine...
I have this under control.

51:20.166 --> 51:21.958
I hope so.

51:25.125 --> 51:27.406
He's here.

51:30.416 --> 51:31.416
Turn it off.

51:42.541 --> 51:44.416
What the fuck?

51:45.083 --> 51:46.083
Hey.

51:51.333 --> 51:52.916
Hey.

51:54.041 --> 51:55.750
This is a bad idea.

51:56.333 --> 51:58.125
You're not reliable in the field.

52:00.791 --> 52:01.958
Let's speak outside.

52:02.583 --> 52:03.583
Sure.

52:17.291 --> 52:19.708
There you go. Two passports.

52:23.250 --> 52:24.250
How are you?

52:25.458 --> 52:29.166
I mean,
this is a fucking shitshow.

52:46.416 --> 52:48.041
Mm...

52:48.791 --> 52:50.458
You shouldn't have come here.

52:52.708 --> 52:55.416
Because I'm unreliable?

52:55.958 --> 52:57.750
- That what you really think?
- Yeah.

53:00.375 --> 53:01.916
What about you, Sam?

53:03.333 --> 53:05.625
Job's over, contract's done.
What're you still doing here?

53:07.250 --> 53:08.416
She has no one.

53:11.041 --> 53:13.708
Let's talk about
what's really going on here.

53:14.666 --> 53:16.208
I know about your kid...

53:17.583 --> 53:20.041
and staying here isn't going to fix it
in some weird way.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.166
Fuck you.

53:24.250 --> 53:25.333
Fuck you.

54:24.625 --> 54:26.000
Do you have any jewelry on?

54:26.958 --> 54:27.958
No.

54:29.041 --> 54:30.250
Put your scarf on.

54:44.250 --> 54:45.500
Hey.

54:53.791 --> 54:56.500
Sam!

54:56.583 --> 54:57.875
- Sam, get me...
- Shut up!

54:57.958 --> 54:59.958
- They're gonna take you.
- What do I do?

55:00.041 --> 55:01.750
- No!
- You have to fight back.

55:02.583 --> 55:04.958
- Sam!
- Zoe, you have to fight them.

55:05.041 --> 55:06.517
- Sam.
- You have to fight back.

55:06.541 --> 55:08.583
Don't let them take you into a car
or a building.

55:08.666 --> 55:10.426
That's your chance.
You have to fight back...

55:10.458 --> 55:12.083
Fuck the shut up!

55:19.875 --> 55:20.958
Happy families.

55:21.708 --> 55:24.000
- Sam.
- Hey. Fight back.

55:24.208 --> 55:25.833
Fight back.

55:27.250 --> 55:28.250
Sam!

55:30.333 --> 55:32.291
No, no, no! Sam!

55:32.375 --> 55:35.000
Fight back, Zoe! Fight back...

55:36.666 --> 55:40.041
Sam! Let me go! Help!

55:40.541 --> 55:41.916
Shut up!

55:50.666 --> 55:53.267
<i>Hassine Mining's $3 billion deal</i>

55:53.291 --> 55:56.583
<i>to secure 6,000 hectares

Rima Hassine.

57:10.125 --> 57:12.250

No, no, no, no, no! Stop! Stop!

It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

59:23.375 --> 59:25.541
It's okay.

59:31.916 --> 59:33.583
Okay? Okay?

59:33.750 --> 59:35.875
Zoe, look at me. It's okay, yeah?

59:36.583 --> 59:37.916
Put your head scarf on.

59:42.375 --> 59:46.375
What's in the bag?

59:46.458 --> 59:48.298
- Tell me what's in the bag.
- There's...

59:49.500 --> 59:51.458
- two phones, and there's...
- Yeah?

59:51.541 --> 59:53.000
- There's cash and a gun.
- Yeah?

59:59.375 --> 01:00:00.500
Okay, come on.

01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:31.833
How much to buy your taxi?

01:00:37.666 --> 01:00:40.416
He says it's not for sale.
It's how he makes his living.

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:43.791
Tell him he can get a better one.
A new one.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.916
Get us out of the city.

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.875
Never before
have I seen such incompetence.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.958
This is a disgrace.

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:20.750
Yes, okay, my cell only.

01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:25.541
I'm sorry...

01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:28.333
about your friend.

01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:39.791
Are we driving to the ferry?

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:42.208
No.

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.125
No passports.

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.000
No cover.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:53.958
So what're we gonna do, then?

01:03:54.291 --> 01:03:55.375
I don't know.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:57.583
I'm... I'm trying to think.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.958
What do you mean, you don't know?
Isn't this your job?

01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:02.166
I...

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:19.583
Can you take me to Rima?

01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:23.375
Yeah.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:39.958
Sir.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.708
Excuse me, sir!

01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:47.291
Excuse me.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.375
That's the entrance.

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:55.250
- Do you think I'll get past security?
- Yeah. I think you'll be fine.

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:57.666
That's Rima.

01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:01.916
Oh, my God.

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:06.416
- That's the man from the hotel.
- Yeah. Fuck.

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:09.458
She must really hate me.

01:06:11.541 --> 01:06:12.833
We don't know that.

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:19.833
- Sam, let's go.
- Stay down. Stay down.

01:06:19.916 --> 01:06:21.833
We need to follow him.

01:06:21.916 --> 01:06:24.041
This is our chance
to find out what's going on.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:58.583
Get what you need?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
No.

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:01.958
What about the cash?

01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:03.791
Client pays when the job's done.

01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:08.291
It's not my problem. You hired me.

01:07:08.583 --> 01:07:09.791
You didn't deliver.

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:13.250
I paid out a lot of money on this job.

01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:14.791
I fronted your expenses.

01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:19.791
When one of my men gets killed,
I pay out to their family.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:28.625
That's $10,000.
You want the rest, you finish the job.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:39.500
I heard about what happened downtown.

01:07:40.916 --> 01:07:42.250
You should have called.

01:07:42.666 --> 01:07:45.458
- I don't like working with you.
- Then why are you here?

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:47.791
The girl and her minder saw my face.

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.833
If I'm identified, the client will spook.

01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:53.750
There'll be no more money.

01:07:54.125 --> 01:07:55.375
As I said...

01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:57.666
not my problem.

01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.875
It will be if I'm dead
or in a police cell.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:08.833
Where's the fat one?

01:08:09.166 --> 01:08:10.500
He's running late.

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:13.875
You want me to kill the bodyguard?

01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:16.375
If you can.

01:08:20.832 --> 01:08:23.750
8521... That's his car.

01:08:31.125 --> 01:08:32.707
This is the last of the cash.

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:37.707
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you drive.

01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:40.832
- What do you mean, if you're not back?
- There's no time for this.

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:42.125
Please...

01:11:50.458 --> 01:11:51.541
Move!

01:12:09.375 --> 01:12:10.416
He's a cop.

01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:12.666
Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
He was.

01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:18.250
What's that?

01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:22.541
It's Rima's username
and password.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.583
If Rima's behind this...

01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:32.916
you won't be safe anywhere.

01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:36.458
So this will never end.

01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:40.541
We have to know if Rima is responsible.

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:43.083
And if she is?

01:12:43.875 --> 01:12:44.916
We get proof...

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:47.708
we threaten to expose her...

01:12:49.916 --> 01:12:51.083
and we negotiate.

01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:56.041
Fuck!

01:12:56.666 --> 01:12:58.458
I can get into her phone.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:00.166
How?

01:13:00.666 --> 01:13:02.916
It's linked to the control room
at the kasbah.

01:13:03.208 --> 01:13:05.291
Okay.

01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:07.375
This password gets me in.

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:10.375
That's good. That's good.

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.500
<i>Mr. Kabila just confirmed</i>

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:17.833
<i>the Izwe Estate Group
are remaining sympathetic.</i>

01:13:17.916 --> 01:13:19.750
I'm heading into their offices now.

01:13:20.666 --> 01:13:24.125
<i>Present the higher offer
and we will be able to cut out Sikong</i>

01:13:24.208 --> 01:13:25.458
<i>and close the deal today.</i>

01:13:25.541 --> 01:13:28.916
I'm certain Sikong don't have the pockets
to match our higher bid.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.416
<i>Agreed. Good luck.</i>

01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:02.416
What are you doing here?

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:12.166
This is ridiculous.

01:14:13.541 --> 01:14:16.333
I think it would be in your best interest
to let this one go.

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:21.250
You need to drop this deal.

01:14:24.291 --> 01:14:28.125
This company is all I have left
of my husband.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.083
And if you think
I'm going to let you destroy it,

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.541
you are deeply mistaken.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
You're making a massive mistake.

01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:42.583
No. We are the bigger company.

01:14:43.666 --> 01:14:45.958
You can't match our deal. It's over.

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:52.500
Good luck finding your daughter.

01:14:53.916 --> 01:14:56.708
It would be a pity
if anything bad should happen to her.

01:15:00.083 --> 01:15:02.000
Sikong wishes her well, of course.

01:15:27.458 --> 01:15:28.833
It looks deserted.

01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:30.625
Yeah. Let's do this.

01:16:25.416 --> 01:16:26.500
Zoe?

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.125
Zoe?

01:16:32.916 --> 01:16:33.916
You here?

01:16:35.875 --> 01:16:36.875
Hey.

01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:46.000
You lied to me.

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:48.458
What?

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:51.041
You said you didn't have a kid.

01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:53.416
You have a kid.

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:58.875
My personal life is none of your business.

01:16:58.958 --> 01:17:00.875
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.375
You shut people out.

01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:10.750
I've never been able to trust anyone.

01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:15.958
- I thought you were different.
- Are you kidding me?

01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:19.208
I lost everything for you.

01:17:20.041 --> 01:17:23.041
- I killed a fucking cop.
- That was your choice, Sam.

01:17:30.458 --> 01:17:32.416
I got pregnant when I was 16.

01:17:34.625 --> 01:17:36.750
I didn't have a choice.
I couldn't take care of her.

01:17:36.833 --> 01:17:38.291
I had to send her away.

01:17:39.333 --> 01:17:40.875
I was just a kid myself.

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:43.458
Well, I was just a kid
when my mom left me.

01:17:43.708 --> 01:17:45.583
Yeah, I know. It's in your file.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.083
She committed suicide
when you were eight.

01:17:52.916 --> 01:17:54.750
Friends are supposed to trust each other.

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:56.375
I'm not your friend.

01:17:58.583 --> 01:17:59.583
Right.

01:18:00.916 --> 01:18:01.958
Good to know.

01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:42.625
Damn it.

01:18:42.875 --> 01:18:44.541
Is there anything I can do?

01:18:45.125 --> 01:18:46.125
No.

01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:13.875
I do care about you, Zoe.

01:19:23.333 --> 01:19:24.750
Do you regret giving her up?

01:19:29.166 --> 01:19:30.166
She, um...

01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:34.875
She found me.
She... she calls me sometimes.

01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:37.291
But you never answer.

01:19:38.583 --> 01:19:42.375
Hmm. I'm...
I'm waiting for the... the right time.

01:19:59.916 --> 01:20:01.208
It's my birthday.

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:02.708
You're in?

01:20:04.083 --> 01:20:05.083
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.375
Okay.

01:20:12.291 --> 01:20:15.625
We have decided to overlook
the ongoing investigation.

01:20:15.708 --> 01:20:18.625
The board agrees with me
that yourself

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:23.458
and Hassine Mining's prior public record
is exemplary.

01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:28.708
We understand that Zoe Tanner
will be treated, uh, accordingly.

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:33.041
I was able to persuade
all parties to sign today,

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.125
if your offer is significantly...

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:39.193
I have the paperwork with me today...

01:20:45.416 --> 01:20:50.500
Madame Hassine?
Madame Hassine, what is your offer?

01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:54.375
I'm so sorry.
I... I can't proceed with this.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.666
Excuse me.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:02.791
Oh, fuck.

01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:05.083
They know where we are.

01:21:05.541 --> 01:21:07.500
She must have seen us on the cameras.

01:21:12.375 --> 01:21:15.041
- What're you doing?
- Locking us in. We'll be safe in here.

01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:17.500
Fuck.

01:21:26.791 --> 01:21:28.476
<i>This is Detective Zuberi.</i>

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:32.375
<i>Calling unit 367 to Kasbah residence.
Hassine family.</i>

01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:37.250
Get rid of her.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:46.666
A car's coming up.

01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:49.458
Can't you get the cameras back on?

01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:50.750
Uh...

01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:51.833
Yeah.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.541
Where is Rima?

01:22:10.083 --> 01:22:12.958
People like her don't do
their own shitty work, Zoe.

01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:15.541
Of course not.

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:26.708
Look.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.708
And who the fuck are these guys?

01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:36.958
Is there a camera out in this hallway?

01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:38.458
Yeah, but they don't all work.

01:22:39.083 --> 01:22:41.208
- Can you get it back on?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:43.375
Okay. Take it easy. You can do it. Okay?

01:22:43.666 --> 01:22:45.083
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:47.983
I got it.

01:22:48.541 --> 01:22:49.541
He's there.

01:22:50.916 --> 01:22:52.583
Where's the other guy?

01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:09.166
You are way out of your jurisdiction.

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.333
I'm under orders
to search this property.

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:12.750
Who from?

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:18.333
I am not permitted
to let anyone onto this property.

01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:20.583
If you have a warrant,
I need to see it,

01:23:20.666 --> 01:23:22.958
or speak with your commander
in Casablanca.

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:41.625
Copy that.

01:23:51.916 --> 01:23:55.208
Fuck me. She's here.

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:21.250
Zoe... are you in there?

01:24:24.958 --> 01:24:27.333
Zoe.

01:24:27.833 --> 01:24:29.625
<i>Zoe, I have to talk to you.</i>

01:24:31.375 --> 01:24:34.041
<i>Somebody's blackmailing me.
Open the door.</i>

01:24:36.458 --> 01:24:38.083
You left me here to die.

01:24:38.833 --> 01:24:40.625
No. No!

01:24:40.916 --> 01:24:43.436
<i>Is that
why you called him here? You bitch.</i>

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.166
Madame Hassine, don't be alarmed.

01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:48.583
Who are you?

01:24:49.625 --> 01:24:50.833
What the fuck?

01:24:54.916 --> 01:24:57.083
You're working for Sikong, aren't you?

01:24:59.916 --> 01:25:01.083
What's going on?

01:25:09.458 --> 01:25:11.291
Don't move.

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.500
What the fuck is going on?

01:25:23.875 --> 01:25:25.500
This is not her people, is it?

01:25:25.791 --> 01:25:28.583
- Obviously not.
- She was telling the truth.

01:25:28.666 --> 01:25:31.000
- This is my fault.
- No, it's not your fault, Zoe.

01:25:34.708 --> 01:25:36.833
Zoe! Zoe!

01:25:44.541 --> 01:25:45.541
Fuck.

01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:06.583
Come on, shoot. Shoot.

01:26:15.958 --> 01:26:18.541
Can you stand?
Rima, you need to stand up.

01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:20.333
We need to get some help. Come on.

01:26:21.041 --> 01:26:22.250
What'd she do?

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.666
What did you do? What was it?

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.666
What did she do?

01:26:38.375 --> 01:26:39.375
Oh, no.

01:26:39.875 --> 01:26:41.666
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

01:26:42.708 --> 01:26:44.833
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.916
The gun. Give me the gun!

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:54.958
Shit. Okay. Okay. Calm down.

01:26:58.958 --> 01:27:00.416
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:27:08.791 --> 01:27:11.000
It's her birthday, it's in the file.
It's...

01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:14.333
It's her birthday.

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.458
No!

01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:23.958
No! Go! Rima, go...

01:27:25.291 --> 01:27:26.916
Please! Please!

01:27:44.291 --> 01:27:46.000
Sam, are you okay?

01:27:46.083 --> 01:27:47.666
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:27:51.875 --> 01:27:53.208
We need to get out.

01:27:54.208 --> 01:27:57.500
Rima! Rima,
we need to get outside! Come on!

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.791
