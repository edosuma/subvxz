00:12.200 --> 00:15.199
Tonight, I stop for petrol,

00:15.200 --> 00:17.799
Richard wears some sunglasses,

00:17.800 --> 00:20.560
and James sees some shirts.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.720
Hello. Good evening.
Thank you so much, everybody.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.679
Thank you. Thank you.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.119
Now, we begin with this.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.159
It is the Toyota GT 86, a car
which has stirred the soul

00:42.160 --> 00:46.239
and indeed the trousers of every
petrolhead in the land.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.719
But, unfortunately, to explain why

00:49.720 --> 00:52.240
I need to be a little bit boring.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.120
What we have here is
a front-wheel drive car

01:02.121 --> 01:06.040
going around Chicago Corner
in an exuberant manner.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.358
If we slow the film down,

01:09.359 --> 01:11.960
you can see the front wheels are
fully turned,

01:11.961 --> 01:15.119
but the car is ploughing straight on.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.680
This is called understeer.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.920
Now, here we have another car
coming around the same corner

01:25.921 --> 01:28.320
in the same exuberant fashion.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.920
However, because this one is
rear-wheel drive,

01:34.921 --> 01:37.999
the back end is sliding out of line.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.119
This is called oversteer.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.600
Now, for reasons that are extremely
difficult to explain

01:44.601 --> 01:49.239
to normal human beings,
petrolheads prefer oversteer.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.559
We like the front end to grip
and the rear to be all loose

01:53.560 --> 01:56.839
and that means we prefer rear-wheel drive.

01:56.840 --> 02:02.039
But rear-drive cars -
Jags, BMWs, Porsches, Mercs -

02:02.040 --> 02:07.000
are complicated to make and that
means they tend to be expensive.

02:14.760 --> 02:19.479
That brings me back to the new GT 86 -

02:19.480 --> 02:24.280
a rear-wheel drive car that
costs just £25,000.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.040
Whoo! Ha-ha!

02:34.320 --> 02:38.799
It gets better.
The engine is a flat-four boxer unit

02:38.800 --> 02:43.519
so the pistons go like that and that
means it can be mounted low down

02:43.520 --> 02:46.759
and that means a low centre of gravity.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.720
And there's no turbo charger
so there's no lag.

02:49.721 --> 02:53.680
Everything about the GT 86 is immediate...

02:55.000 --> 02:56.199
and brilliant.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.080
And I haven't got to the best bit yet.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.680
To make sure that its tail
is as waggly as possible...

03:09.280 --> 03:13.399
they use exactly the same
sort of skinny little tyres

03:13.400 --> 03:15.600
they use on a Prius.

03:24.120 --> 03:29.719
And what it means is the petrolhead
can enjoy some tail-out action

03:29.720 --> 03:32.679
at low, non-frightening speeds.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.880
Look, here we are, 30 miles an
hour, well within the speed limit,

03:36.881 --> 03:38.800
and the tail's gone!

03:50.200 --> 03:51.680
You might think it's daft

03:51.681 --> 03:55.039
fitting deliberately ungrippy tyres
on a car.

03:55.040 --> 03:59.159
You might think that you'd
inevitably crash, but would you?

03:59.160 --> 04:00.400
Well, let's find out.

04:00.401 --> 04:04.479
How hard is it to slide this thing
at 80 miles per hour

04:04.480 --> 04:06.560
the wrong way round the Hammerhead?

04:14.040 --> 04:15.879
Not hard.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.519
You could drift this car
while reading a book.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.358
So I did.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.199
"Some regard non-echoic irony"

04:24.200 --> 04:29.599
"as being produced by semantic reversal."

04:29.600 --> 04:31.480
Interesting point.

04:35.040 --> 04:39.200
Because of the thin tyres, it's
obvious the GT 86 was not designed

04:39.201 --> 04:42.559
to set new lap records at the Nurburgring.

04:42.560 --> 04:46.679
And with a 197 horsepower,
two-litre engine,

04:46.680 --> 04:48.920
it won't win many drag races either.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.480
What it will do,
though, is put a massive smile

04:56.481 --> 05:00.600
on the face of every motoring
enthusiast in the world.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.079
It isn't even stupid.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.320
It comes with easy finance
and a five-year warranty

05:16.321 --> 05:20.919
and cruise control and Bluetooth and
air-conditioning come as standard.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.078
There's a boot too, which is big
enough for things

05:24.079 --> 05:26.280
and in the back, a couple of seats.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.078
There are, however, a couple of problems.

05:32.079 --> 05:34.880
One, it doesn't look
particularly interesting

05:34.881 --> 05:37.920
and two, it has a deadly rival.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.080
Welcome, everyone, to the Subaru BRZ.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.120
Like the Toyota, it has rear drive.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.600
And a low-mounted two-litre boxer engine.

05:54.800 --> 06:00.359
Like the Toyota,
it'll go from 0-60 in 7.7 seconds

06:00.360 --> 06:04.639
and onwards to a top speed of 137.

06:04.640 --> 06:08.000
And the similarities go further than that.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.239
Both cost the same.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.638
They have the same bodies

06:15.639 --> 06:18.440
and the same interiors with
the same equipment.

06:18.441 --> 06:22.599
They're even built by the same
people in the same factory.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.920
You might imagine, then,
that it's quite hard to

06:24.921 --> 06:28.200
choose between them,
but, actually, it isn't.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.840
Watch, because this is how you do it.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.119
Eeeny meeny miny moe
Catch a teacher by his toe.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.520
When he squeals let him go
Eeeny meeny miny moe.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.519
Toyota it is.

06:54.240 --> 06:59.119
A-ha, now we must find out how
fast the winner of our

06:59.120 --> 07:02.640
eeny-meeny-miny-moe test goes
round our track and that, of course,

07:02.641 --> 07:06.239
means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.200
Some say that,
following the vote on gay marriage,

07:09.201 --> 07:12.719
he's got engaged to James May's lawn mower.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.599
And that he's become convinced this
week that Henry IV is buried

07:17.600 --> 07:20.639
under the Follow Through?!

07:20.640 --> 07:23.000
All we know is he's called The Stig!

07:24.760 --> 07:26.159
And he's off.

07:26.160 --> 07:30.039
Skinny Prius tyres scrambling
for grip on the damp track

07:30.040 --> 07:32.118
could make for some big slides.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.720
Let's be finding out
here on the first corner.

07:36.680 --> 07:40.960
He's keeping it remarkably tidy so
far. That is a bit of a surprise.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.200
♪ Canada. ♪

07:45.600 --> 07:48.158
Stig still obsessed with national anthems.

07:48.159 --> 07:50.238
No need to tell you where that's from

07:50.239 --> 07:54.358
and no surprise the GT 86 did go
a bit sideways around Chicago.

07:54.359 --> 07:57.838
Right, Hammerhead now.
ABS pulsing hard under braking.

07:57.839 --> 07:59.920
Suspect it might oversteer here.

07:59.921 --> 08:02.079
Yes, there it is.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.839
It is very, very tail happy
when it's greasy.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.199
Bet Stig's smiling, though.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.440
♪ From far and wide, Canada... ♪

08:13.920 --> 08:17.718
Now, will we see a small brown
Richard III from the Follow Through?

08:17.719 --> 08:21.480
I think we might. Looking a little
bit out of shape there.

08:21.481 --> 08:25.159
OK, now we just have two corners left.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.880
Here we are, little bit of opposite
lock going in there to keep

08:27.881 --> 08:30.479
it all tidy and now Gambon.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.398
Here he comes and - guess what? -

08:32.399 --> 08:35.039
he's sideways again, but across the line.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.600
It did it in one minute, 11.7.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.839
I made that up.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.358
It was a little bit slower.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.480
It was a lot, lot slower actually.

08:56.481 --> 09:01.039
1.31.03, so there we are.

09:01.040 --> 09:05.559
But, once again, we must turn to
the baby Jesus who once said,

09:05.560 --> 09:09.439
"He who shall be last,
shall be sideways and smiling."

09:13.480 --> 09:17.798
And now it is time for the news
and the news is Subaru has announced

09:17.799 --> 09:19.960
that there will be a new Impreza,

09:19.961 --> 09:24.199
but that it won't be coming to
Britain. I'm sorry, what?

09:24.200 --> 09:27.318
Yes, there is a new one but we're
not going to have it in Britain.

09:27.319 --> 09:29.240
They're not going to sell it.

09:29.241 --> 09:34.239
The Yob-mobile is not going to be
sold in Britain? That is so.

09:34.240 --> 09:38.400
But how will our studio audience get
here every week? I've no idea.

09:38.401 --> 09:43.919
I'm not joking. Every single week
our car park is 75% Subaru Imprezas.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.840
Don't worry about our car park.

09:45.841 --> 09:50.799
What's going to happen to Wales
because, once again, those of us

09:50.800 --> 09:55.559
who choose to live in the countryside
are not just ignored but abused,

09:55.560 --> 09:58.680
it would seem deliberately,
and I've had enough, seriously -

09:58.681 --> 10:00.799
the end of the Impreza.

10:00.800 --> 10:05.118
I mean, they've taken our libraries,
they've taken our post offices,

10:05.119 --> 10:09.278
they've taken our bus services
and they can never take our freedom.

10:09.279 --> 10:10.440
It must stop.

10:10.441 --> 10:13.479
Crikey! Hammond's gone mad.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.999
It's the end.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.118
You say that, Hammond,
and indeed they have because they're

10:18.119 --> 10:22.438
only going to concentrate now on the
Forester and the Legacy Outback.

10:22.439 --> 10:25.158
And the BLZ that
I was just talking about in my film.

10:25.159 --> 10:28.118
Well, technically, yes.
Sorry, lads, I don't care.

10:28.119 --> 10:30.238
You're rambling on about cars
that don't matter.

10:30.239 --> 10:32.598
Wait, what do you mean
"technically, yes" on the BLZ?

10:32.599 --> 10:34.398
The thing is they did a deal with Toyota

10:34.399 --> 10:36.398
when they did their joint
venture thing. Yeah.

10:36.399 --> 10:39.760
And the arrangement was,
for every ten Subarus that are sold,

10:39.761 --> 10:43.319
they can sell 90 of the Toyotas.

10:43.320 --> 10:48.159
So you can order a Subaru
and have it some time in the future,

10:48.160 --> 10:51.238
or you can have a Toyota this
afternoon, sir. You're kidding?

10:51.239 --> 10:54.518
But either way, you can't have an
Impreza. That's the key issue here.

10:54.519 --> 10:57.558
You may as well just get
rid of the countryside.

10:57.559 --> 10:59.958
All right, all right, Hammond.
That's incredible.

10:59.959 --> 11:03.318
I thought it was
all about the ban on fox hunting.

11:03.319 --> 11:06.080
It is a good question, though.
What are yobbos going to drive?

11:06.081 --> 11:07.519
I don't know.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.198
Well, if you are a yobbo
and you have a suggestion,

11:10.199 --> 11:13.158
write it down on a note, attach it to brick

11:13.159 --> 11:15.160
and throw it through our window

11:15.161 --> 11:19.959
at 201, Wood Lane, London,
W, wherever we are, 12.

11:19.960 --> 11:24.119
Hammond. What? You like a Camaro,
don't you? Yes, I do.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.960
OK, well, they've made one just for
you. Here it is. There you go.

11:26.961 --> 11:28.160
Funny!

11:30.840 --> 11:33.278
Ignore the little one,
that's a Hot Wheels one.

11:33.279 --> 11:37.438
What they've done is a full size
Hot Wheels model of the Camaro.

11:37.439 --> 11:41.238
So they've made a full size
version of a model which is

11:41.239 --> 11:43.798
a miniature version of a full size car?

11:43.799 --> 11:46.800
Yes, I can't understand the logic
myself but that's what they've done.

11:46.801 --> 11:48.959
That's a brilliant idea. Is it?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.918
That will survive an 800mph impact
with a giant skirting board

11:51.919 --> 11:54.038
and come out completely unscathed.

11:54.039 --> 11:55.838
The worst thing about Hot Wheels is

11:55.839 --> 11:59.240
when you get up in the night
for a pee and you tread on one.

11:59.241 --> 12:02.079
Or Lego.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.839
Or an upturned plug.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.759
No, Lego's worse. Why?

12:06.760 --> 12:10.120
Because an upturned plug is big.
Lego hides in the carpets.

12:10.121 --> 12:11.719
You can't see it.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.318
Is there anything worse than an
upturned plug for treading on

12:14.319 --> 12:15.800
in the middle of the night?

12:15.801 --> 12:17.519
A land mine.

12:19.520 --> 12:24.279
A tiger? Your house, James...
I know something worse.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.360
Dog shit? I was about to say...

12:29.240 --> 12:32.159
It's the, "-splat!"

12:32.160 --> 12:36.279
If you have a lot of dogs, it can happen.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.278
You have horses in your house.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.478
I did. On occasion, yes, it has happened.

12:40.479 --> 12:43.680
Have you ever trodden in some horse
manure? Possibly, unbeknownst to me.

12:43.681 --> 12:46.439
I just had a warm foot.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.838
Anyway, if you want a full size
model of a toy car,

12:49.839 --> 12:53.998
it's basically a Camaro with Hot
Wheels written on it, it's £40,000.

12:53.999 --> 12:56.640
But it will be worth more
if you keep it in the box.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.439
Ooh, now, business news.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.238
Yes. Important business news.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.360
Classic car values have been
shooting through the roof

13:05.361 --> 13:08.879
in recent years and months
and I think I know why.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.400
If you put your life savings
in a bank, what is it nowadays,

13:12.401 --> 13:14.279
half a percent interest?

13:14.280 --> 13:18.879
So if you put £25,000 life savings
in the bank you get...

13:18.880 --> 13:20.399
125 quid.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.518
It is about 125 quid a year
back in interest.

13:23.519 --> 13:25.358
Now, if you'd have bought ten years ago

13:25.359 --> 13:29.358
an E-Type Jag for £25,000, it would
now be worth £80,000.

13:29.359 --> 13:33.038
£80,000, and you'd have had
an E-Type to drive around in,

13:33.039 --> 13:36.558
cos you can't drive around in a bank
statement. Makes perfect sense.

13:36.559 --> 13:39.518
And there's no tax presumably on the
profit on a car? No, there isn't.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.958
On a car, you can sell it
and not pay any tax on it.

13:41.959 --> 13:45.518
But there's quite a lot of cars doing
that. Ferrari 275 GTS.

13:45.519 --> 13:48.760
If you bought one of those
ten years ago, £130,000,

13:48.761 --> 13:51.759
now half a million in ten years. I know.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.718
It's staggering how cars have gone up.

13:53.719 --> 13:56.078
The difficult thing is knowing
what to pick next,

13:56.079 --> 13:57.920
spotting what's going to do that.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.359
Talk to me. Really?

14:00.360 --> 14:02.080
So, Jeremy, what's going to be...?

14:02.081 --> 14:05.839
I once bought a BMW
three-litre CSL for £3,000.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.480
They're now worth 40, 50? Easily.
How much did you sell yours for?

14:09.481 --> 14:10.799
1,500 quid.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.120
I am the man you turn to.
Come on, your top tip.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.039
Subaru Impreza probably!

14:21.640 --> 14:23.678
We ought to take this quite seriously

14:23.679 --> 14:26.518
because we could actually dispense
sound financial advice.

14:26.519 --> 14:29.798
A car I've noticed has gone up
a lot in recent years

14:29.799 --> 14:31.640
is the Rolls Royce Corniche.

14:31.641 --> 14:35.039
Yeah, like the one you've got, James.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.679
How much is it worth now, James?
About a million pounds. Is it?

14:39.680 --> 14:42.998
That's nothing compared to
the Mercedes 600 Grosser.

14:42.999 --> 14:46.440
Such as the one you've got,
Jeremy. £1 billion.

14:46.441 --> 14:48.879
Really? A billion pounds?

14:48.880 --> 14:50.958
It's now a billion to buy one of those.

14:50.959 --> 14:54.798
If anybody's interested,
give me a shout after the show.

14:54.799 --> 14:56.638
You know the old Maserati Quattroporte?

14:56.639 --> 15:00.518
We all agreed on this actually. It
was one of the most want-one cars.

15:00.519 --> 15:03.598
You just got in and wanted
one of these. Fantastic thing.

15:03.599 --> 15:06.158
For me, though,
the only problem with it was,

15:06.159 --> 15:08.118
I thought its headlights were
a bit too small.

15:08.119 --> 15:09.718
They were out of proportion.

15:09.719 --> 15:12.598
There's a new Quattroporte
been announced. Here it is.

15:12.599 --> 15:15.280
I think it's got the same problem.
It's got piggy little eyes.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.160
It looks like Ray Mears.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.799
A bit fat and lives on squirrels.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.158
Do you know the best thing about Ray Mears?

15:23.159 --> 15:25.598
You know he always wears those
very tight shorts?

15:25.599 --> 15:28.118
Well, when he bends down to
whittle something,

15:28.119 --> 15:29.960
you can always see a testes.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.198
That is the best thing
about Ray Mears? Not the best thing.

15:35.199 --> 15:38.360
The occasional glimpse of chicken
skin outside of his shorts?

15:40.240 --> 15:43.999
No, you know what I mean. No, I don't.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.720
Don't bend down, Ray. No, there it is!

15:46.721 --> 15:49.039
One of the boys has popped out.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.838
Anyway, if you do want a Maserati,

15:50.839 --> 15:52.920
there's a V6 turbo which is £80,000

15:52.921 --> 15:56.239
and a V8 turbo which is £108,000.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.999
I did want one quite a lot.
You have now ruined it.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.918
And that's the end of the news.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.918
Now, over the years, we've had many
big races across Europe

16:05.919 --> 16:08.880
and in every single one of them,
the car, driven by me,

16:08.881 --> 16:11.559
has always beaten public transport.

16:11.560 --> 16:16.479
However, since the last race,
public transport has got a lot faster

16:16.480 --> 16:21.599
so the producers thought it would be
a good idea for us to have another.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.159
Yes, and they announced
that they had one ticket

16:25.160 --> 16:27.078
for a Champions League football match to be

16:27.079 --> 16:30.918
played between AC Milan
and a Belgian team called Anderlecht

16:30.919 --> 16:33.760
down at the San Siro Stadium
here near Milan.

16:33.761 --> 16:37.239
And the first of us
to get there could have it.

16:37.240 --> 16:41.559
The start would be here
at Wembley Stadium in Wembley.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.400
As usual, James and I would be on
public transport, buses,

16:44.401 --> 16:46.239
trains and tubes.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.358
And, as usual,

16:47.359 --> 16:51.078
Jeremy would be making
the 800-mile journey by car, except

16:51.079 --> 16:54.118
obviously for the Channel which
he would have to cross by boat.

16:54.119 --> 16:58.198
There was, however, one difference
because the producer said to me that

16:58.199 --> 17:02.280
I couldn't just turn up at the start
line as I usually do with

17:02.281 --> 17:07.598
a £350,000 super car made
out of rhodium and myrrh.

17:07.599 --> 17:12.559
No, they said the car he chose had to
cost no more than £35,000.

17:12.560 --> 17:17.439
So, just to summarise, Jeremy would
be slower and we would be faster,

17:17.440 --> 17:21.359
so you can see why were feeling
just a little bit confident.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.280
To have a hope of making
the kick-off in Italy,

17:28.281 --> 17:32.639
the start time was an alarming 3.30am

17:32.640 --> 17:38.480
and, rather worryingly, at 3.20am,
Jeremy still hadn't arrived.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.958
Right, so 35 grand. He's not going to
get that much power for that, is he?

17:43.959 --> 17:47.718
No. What I'd do, to be honest,
even though it's a bit boring,

17:47.719 --> 17:51.398
is get something like a diesel Audi,
cos it will go fast enough

17:51.399 --> 17:53.638
and you'd be comfortable
and you get the range.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.520
BM. Or a BM, yeah.
Get something reasonable. A Volvo.

17:56.521 --> 17:58.239
Even a Mercedes for that.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.199
'Soon we had an answer.'

18:03.760 --> 18:07.680
Yeah, what he's done, he's gone for
a Mustang. A Ford Mustang.

18:07.681 --> 18:11.999
There they are.
He looks pleased with himself.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.439
Dear, dear.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.919
What do you think of that?

18:16.920 --> 18:19.878
Well, you do know, don't you,
that just because a car has

18:19.879 --> 18:23.838
go-faster stripes on it, it doesn't
actually mean it goes faster?

18:23.839 --> 18:24.918
I know.

18:24.919 --> 18:27.920
You wouldn't go through Europe in
a Stetson with chaps on, would you?

18:27.921 --> 18:31.599
He would. So why? Come on! Because...

18:31.600 --> 18:34.840
Mustangs, very good straight line
quarter of a mile.

18:34.841 --> 18:39.479
That's what they're for. This
is 800 miles across Europe. Yep. No.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.999
Have you quite finished
because have you seen the time?

18:44.000 --> 18:47.280
Actually that's a very good point. I
think we need to get cracking. Yeah.

18:47.281 --> 18:51.640
'And so, at precisely 3.37am
the race began!'

18:59.920 --> 19:03.880
Mustn't spin the wheels on the
pitch. Mustn't break the pitch.

19:03.881 --> 19:06.559
Here we go... again. Look.

19:06.560 --> 19:10.040
That's it, now we've got to
play for England. It's the wardrobe.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.639
Look, there's Adrian Cole's shirt.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.599
Right, 16 hours to kick-off

19:14.600 --> 19:18.960
and I've got 814 miles to go.

19:21.640 --> 19:24.440
'For the first part of their
journey, Richard and James would

19:24.441 --> 19:29.159
'have to catch a night bus and then
an overland train to St Pancreas.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.160
'I, meanwhile, had a choice.'

19:33.640 --> 19:38.399
So, North Circular M25,
or straight through London?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.960
3.45 in the morning, I'm thinking
straight through London.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.520
Wake a few people up...
in Sheffield, in fact.

19:49.240 --> 19:52.759
Morning.
I'd like a single to Hendon overland.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.080
First Class, that must be upstairs
at the front. Is it? I don't know.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.278
I haven't been on a night bus
since the late '80s,

20:02.279 --> 20:04.280
but when I did, it wasn't like this.

20:06.960 --> 20:10.360
I was envisaging a sea of sick,
sloshing from side to side.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.679
If you're sophisticated or intelligent,

20:17.680 --> 20:19.759
in other words, European,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.559
you might think James May has a point.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.160
That this is a stupid car.

20:26.120 --> 20:30.479
In fact, if you are from the land of
Wordsworth and Shakespeare

20:30.480 --> 20:32.839
and Right Honourable Gentleman,

20:32.840 --> 20:35.999
you probably think
the Mustang is a bit daft.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.119
A codpiece, really, for the shorter chap.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.560
You still have a Mustang, don't you? Yes.

20:41.561 --> 20:46.240
Judi Dench, June Whitfield, Melvyn Bragg.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.200
These are NOT Ford Mustang people.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.278
Would you drive it to Milan?

20:54.279 --> 20:56.400
I wouldn't drive it to Cheltenham.

20:56.401 --> 21:00.719
I mean, it's lovely. I like Mustangs,
but they're not fast.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.678
You know how people who don't ride
bikes think Harleys are fast,

21:03.679 --> 21:04.878
and they're not? Mmm.

21:04.879 --> 21:05.880
It's like that.

21:07.960 --> 21:12.119
'This particular Mustang,
however, is not like that.'

21:12.120 --> 21:15.640
In America, this car costs
the equivalent of £35,000.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.879
It is very cheap.

21:17.880 --> 21:22.239
But its engine produces 662 horsepower.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.239
That's round about 100 more than you get

21:28.240 --> 21:31.200
from a Ferrari 458 or a Mercedes SLS.

21:32.960 --> 21:38.760
It is, in fact, the most powerful
road-going V8 ever made.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.438
'And today, I will need that power,

21:44.439 --> 21:48.078
'because since we last did
one of these pan-European races,

21:48.079 --> 21:51.440
'the seesaw has tilted
to make life harder for the car.'

21:53.320 --> 21:56.678
You see, the train they're using
to get to the Channel

21:56.679 --> 21:59.200
is 20 minutes faster than it used to be.

21:59.201 --> 22:01.279
And to make things worse,

22:01.280 --> 22:05.078
they've stopped using the JetCat
things to go across the Channel.

22:05.079 --> 22:07.440
I have to use an old-fashioned ferry,

22:07.441 --> 22:11.239
and that's 40 minutes slower
than it used to be.

22:11.240 --> 22:14.960
So even before I get to France,
I've lost an hour.

22:19.080 --> 22:22.638
An hour ahead. Doesn't stand
a chance. You can't make that up.

22:22.639 --> 22:26.798
Yeah, well, you're right. Well, unless he tries
to make it up in a Mustang, round a corner.

22:26.799 --> 22:28.080
Then he'll just be up a tree.

22:28.081 --> 22:31.879
'It's true.
Mustangs are not good at corners.

22:31.880 --> 22:35.558
'But that wouldn't be a problem
for me on the motorway.

22:35.559 --> 22:38.200
'What was a problem was fuel consumption.'

22:39.600 --> 22:44.040
Since I left Wembley,
I've done 12.6 miles to the gallon.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.319
That's not brilliant, is it?

22:47.320 --> 22:48.718
'And nor, as it turned out,

22:48.719 --> 22:52.480
'was the Mustang's voice activated
telephone directory.'

22:52.481 --> 22:54.200
Richard Hammond.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.360
'For media device, say,

22:57.361 --> 23:01.039
'"User device," "USB line in,"
or "Bluetooth audio."

23:01.040 --> 23:03.680
'For settings, say,
"Phone or Voice settings."

23:03.681 --> 23:06.479
'For sync services, say, "Services."

23:06.480 --> 23:10.080
'If a route is active, you can say,
"Next turn," "Update route,"

23:10.081 --> 23:12.840
' "Route status..." ' Shut up!

23:14.120 --> 23:15.520
Look, St Pancras.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.320
Do you want to go before we set off?

23:19.321 --> 23:21.479
Please come in. Thank you.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.199
This is nice!

23:23.200 --> 23:27.799
'Or see the tips available at
www.saymyroute.com.'

23:27.800 --> 23:30.440
HE SCREAMS Please, stop talking!

23:32.080 --> 23:34.360
As we waited for the train to depart,

23:34.361 --> 23:39.119
the tension on board was electric.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.358
It is about ten years since
we did one of these races

23:44.359 --> 23:47.118
with James and me on public transport
and Jeremy in a car.

23:47.119 --> 23:48.438
A few things have changed.

23:48.439 --> 23:50.198
Amongst them, ten years ago,

23:50.199 --> 23:53.720
my esteemed college would have
managed to stay awake.

23:53.721 --> 23:56.039
Obviously those days are gone.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.959
It has caught up with him.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.760
Nevertheless, the race is still going on.

24:00.761 --> 24:02.359
And here is Jeremy.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.960
And he appears to be in Dover.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.559
I was indeed boarding HMS Yesterday,

24:14.560 --> 24:18.960
where I found out that not everyone
shares my views on the Mustang.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.438
So I mocked this thing
all the way through London.

24:25.439 --> 24:27.758
I mocked it, actually,
all the way through my life.

24:27.759 --> 24:30.120
But there is something about it which is,

24:30.121 --> 24:33.559
as you can see quite appealing.
People like it.

24:33.560 --> 24:36.600
I think it appeals to our inner
nine-year-old.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.398
'Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard...'

24:42.399 --> 24:44.758
He's not really French. It's just...

24:44.759 --> 24:48.760
I find the girls respond to this accent.

24:48.761 --> 24:50.359
It works very nicely.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.760
'Please ensure that your luggage is...'

24:52.761 --> 24:54.000
Lugg-age!

24:57.120 --> 25:00.799
Our new, faster train
thundered across Kent,

25:00.800 --> 25:03.519
and was already under the Channel

25:03.520 --> 25:07.879
when HMS 1924
finally lumbered out of Dover.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.079
Why are we going so slowly?!

25:10.080 --> 25:13.240
We used to be able to
go across the Channel in 50 minutes

25:13.241 --> 25:15.839
and now it takes 90 minutes.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.360
It doesn't make any sense!

25:22.800 --> 25:25.280
We're already steaming ahead
through here somewhere,

25:25.281 --> 25:27.239
and he's just there, look.

25:27.240 --> 25:30.159
Miles ahead. That's incredible.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.438
'And thanks to the speedo app on my phone,

25:32.439 --> 25:35.480
'we could keep abreast
of our immense pace.'

25:35.481 --> 25:38.079
177 miles an hour.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.039
He's not doing that, is he? No.

25:41.040 --> 25:46.199
'In fact, I was only doing
a Victorian 23 knots.'

25:46.200 --> 25:49.360
I'm going to ring May because, as
you can see, we're nearly in France.

25:49.361 --> 25:52.879
Here he is now.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.919
Jeremy Clarkson.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.599
May, yes. 'Yes, hello.'

25:56.600 --> 25:57.640
Where are you?

25:57.641 --> 26:00.999
We are about 15 minutes outside Paris,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.719
and about 200 miles into France.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.319
You're what? 15 minutes from Paris?

26:06.320 --> 26:08.199
Yes.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.559
OK. I'm not...

26:11.560 --> 26:13.639
not actually in France yet.

26:13.640 --> 26:17.359
What, you're still on the boat?

26:17.360 --> 26:20.120
This is a setback, I admit.
But enjoy your cockiness.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.800
Well, he's had it!

26:25.600 --> 26:28.640
Right, they are now arriving in Paris.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.079
Right, next train.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.879
There you go. Paris, 275km.

26:35.880 --> 26:40.440
So they are 275km in front of me.

26:43.080 --> 26:47.760
Do you ever get the impression
you're completely wasting your day?

26:52.160 --> 26:55.718
On the plus side, Hammond and May
now had to get across Paris

26:55.719 --> 26:57.438
to catch their train to Milan.

26:57.439 --> 27:00.800
Which wouldn't be leaving
for another 80 minutes.

27:00.801 --> 27:04.079
It's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.359
'That meant I could close the gap

27:06.360 --> 27:09.040
'and I had just the engine for the job.'

27:11.000 --> 27:14.159
It's a big, 5.8L, supercharged V8,

27:14.160 --> 27:18.119
but unlike most traditional American V8s,

27:18.120 --> 27:22.119
this one isn't made from
melted-down box girder bridges.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.400
It's actually quite sophisticated.

27:27.240 --> 27:31.240
The block is made in Germany,
where they know what they're doing.

27:31.241 --> 27:34.119
It's got plasma-this and Stellite-that.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.680
The propshaft is even
made from carbon fibre.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.880
Hopefully, then, it won't explode

27:40.881 --> 27:45.200
when I introduce it to what
we Europeans call speed.

27:50.120 --> 27:55.719
'0-60 in this car takes just 3.7 seconds.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.880
'And the top speed is 202.'

28:00.680 --> 28:02.800
And I needn't worry
about the police, of course,

28:02.801 --> 28:05.759
because I'm an Englishman in American car,

28:05.760 --> 28:09.839
and the French, well,
they love that Anglo-US combination.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.799
It makes them feel all warm and gooey.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.479
Bonjour, monsieur.

28:15.480 --> 28:19.120
Will you carry my bag for me for
a bit? Er, let me think about it.

28:19.121 --> 28:21.039
Um... no.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.519
50 miles to empty. Fuel level low.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.560
I've got to go for a pee now.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.678
I think that's the ladies! I don't know!

28:31.679 --> 28:33.518
It's all women in there!
Go and have a look.

28:33.519 --> 28:34.880
They always have. It's French.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.880
No, it's just confusing.
I'm going to hold onto it.

28:40.881 --> 28:44.599
'At the petrol station,
I discovered a problem.'

28:44.600 --> 28:46.399
You are joking?!

28:46.400 --> 28:49.199
It's only got a 50L fuel tank?

28:49.200 --> 28:52.760
50L? What's the point of a 50L fuel tank?

29:00.320 --> 29:02.519
So I'm doing the maths.

29:02.520 --> 29:06.479
50L, that's about 14 miles to the gallon.

29:06.480 --> 29:10.640
Which means I'll have to stop
every 140 miles.

29:12.840 --> 29:17.519
'As the Mustang set about draining
its fuel thimble, the phone rang.'

29:19.680 --> 29:22.279
Hammond. 'Hello, how are you?'

29:22.280 --> 29:24.359
'Are you still in Paris?'

29:24.360 --> 29:26.478
We're just setting off now, yeah. What?

29:26.479 --> 29:27.958
We're leaving Gare de Lyon now.

29:27.959 --> 29:30.718
And you're 100 miles ahead of me already,

29:30.719 --> 29:32.678
and you'll be increasing that lead?

29:32.679 --> 29:33.758
The thing is, mate,

29:33.759 --> 29:35.758
we've still got quite a long way to go,

29:35.759 --> 29:37.960
and I don't want to put an end
to all this right now,

29:37.961 --> 29:39.919
but you have clearly had it.

29:39.920 --> 29:43.239
That is really not good.

29:43.240 --> 29:47.319
They're on the super fast train,
and they're now doing

29:47.320 --> 29:49.520
100 miles an hour more than I am.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.599
Sit rep -

29:51.600 --> 29:53.720
I'm going to lose!

29:59.840 --> 30:03.159
I mean, normally,

30:03.160 --> 30:06.719
normally I win those races by minutes.

30:06.720 --> 30:10.240
Yeah, well, seconds, actually, when
we raced the Ferrari to Verbier.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.639
No, no, you're absolutely right.

30:12.640 --> 30:16.559
So to be an hour behind
before I even got to France,

30:16.560 --> 30:19.079
the situation was pretty bleak.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.198
But we shall find out
what happens later on,

30:21.199 --> 30:24.958
because now it is time to put a star
in our reasonably-priced car.

30:24.959 --> 30:27.918
Now, my guest tonight drives
a Bentley Continental.

30:27.919 --> 30:30.840
AND a Range Rover,
AND has an impenetrable accent,

30:30.841 --> 30:33.279
but isn't a footballer.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.238
She is, in fact,
an incredibly talented songsmith.

30:36.239 --> 30:38.920
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Amy Macdonald!

30:43.120 --> 30:45.639
How are you?

30:45.640 --> 30:47.479
Good, thank you.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.319
Excellent! Look who's here!

30:49.320 --> 30:51.319
Marvellous!

30:51.320 --> 30:54.758
Now, as you say yourself,
you're not really a household name,

30:54.759 --> 30:57.680
but you have had
some EXTRAORDINARY success.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.039
Yes, I like to think so.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.558
How many albums have you sold now?

31:01.559 --> 31:04.480
We're close to about five million, I think.

31:04.481 --> 31:05.959
Five million albums!

31:05.960 --> 31:07.198
You started when you were...

31:07.199 --> 31:09.720
well, you were 15 or something,
when you picked up a guitar?

31:09.721 --> 31:12.239
Yeah. What are you now? 25.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.119
25! Yeah.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.638
And it's not just Britain, either,
it's all across Europe.

31:16.639 --> 31:18.518
Yes, I've been very fortunate

31:18.519 --> 31:20.638
with the support I've had in places

31:20.639 --> 31:23.198
like Germany or Switzerland or Holland.

31:23.199 --> 31:24.598
I've been very lucky with it.

31:24.599 --> 31:26.960
Do they understand
what you're on about there?

31:26.961 --> 31:29.119
Erm, most of them understand.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.639
I have had the odd strange comment.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.359
One in particular was,
"Now that you're successful,"

31:35.360 --> 31:37.640
"will you learn to speak English properly?"

31:39.960 --> 31:41.199
And will you?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.919
I still haven't!

31:43.920 --> 31:47.438
Sorry, Scotland! Couldn't help
myself! Couldn't help myself!

31:47.439 --> 31:49.398
And you're a rare thing, actually.

31:49.399 --> 31:52.638
You're a Scottish person who
actually still lives in Scotland.

31:52.639 --> 31:54.038
Is that right? Yes, I do.

31:54.039 --> 31:56.838
You're not like Connery
and all the other ones

31:56.839 --> 31:59.558
who live in the Bahamas and go,
"I love Scotland!"

31:59.559 --> 32:01.878
"I love it so much, I live in Monaco."

32:01.879 --> 32:03.880
That was a Scottish accent, by the way.

32:03.881 --> 32:07.039
That was terrible.
It was dreadful, I agree.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.598
So you are really, I mean,

32:08.599 --> 32:12.558
one of the biggest petrolheads
I think we've ever had on the show.

32:12.559 --> 32:15.718
On a scale of one to ten,
where would you put yourself?

32:15.719 --> 32:17.918
I don't know, I mean,
I went through a phase

32:17.919 --> 32:20.278
where I was stat crazy
and I knew everything.

32:20.279 --> 32:23.118
I knew all the brake horsepower
of everything that was coming out,

32:23.119 --> 32:24.918
and I just was obsessed by it.

32:24.919 --> 32:27.718
I've just... Ever since
I passed my driving test,

32:27.719 --> 32:30.998
it's just been something that
I've been really excited by

32:30.999 --> 32:33.358
and just exhilarated,
and I love the thought of cars.

32:33.359 --> 32:35.038
I know you had a big love affair

32:35.039 --> 32:37.440
for quite a long time, actually,
with the Audi R8?

32:37.441 --> 32:40.479
Yes, I did. That was my first true love.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.320
Before I even passed my driving test,

32:42.321 --> 32:45.559
and when I was able to buy that car,

32:45.560 --> 32:47.479
it was just a moment of...

32:47.480 --> 32:48.918
I was sitting behind the wheel,

32:48.919 --> 32:50.880
and you see the little badge that says R8,

32:50.881 --> 32:54.359
and actually had to say to myself, "No!"

32:54.360 --> 32:58.759
"No way!" Was yours a V8 or V10?

32:58.760 --> 33:01.999
I've done the V8 and then the V10,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.920
and then I done the R8 GT as well.
So I'm well-rounded on the R8!

33:04.921 --> 33:06.759
You've done a lot!

33:06.760 --> 33:09.318
Actually, the GT was quite
an interesting idea for them,

33:09.319 --> 33:11.838
because it was... How did they
change it? I've forgotten.

33:11.839 --> 33:14.358
They basically made it a whole lot lighter,

33:14.359 --> 33:15.958
so everything was carbon fibre.

33:15.959 --> 33:18.558
They got rid of the glass
in the windows and lowered it,

33:18.559 --> 33:20.640
so it was just quicker.
Was it more powerful?

33:20.641 --> 33:22.879
It was up to about, I think,

33:22.880 --> 33:26.399
560 from about 520 from the standard V10.

33:26.400 --> 33:30.118
Do you write albums thinking,
"Right, if I sell a lot of these,

33:30.119 --> 33:32.560
"I can go and buy a..." Yeah, definitely!

33:32.561 --> 33:35.239
You do? Yeah! This is the motivation?

33:35.240 --> 33:37.679
I live my life that way!

33:37.680 --> 33:40.559
The ultimate goal is the Bugatti Veyron,

33:40.560 --> 33:44.480
but I've got to get busy with the old
songwriting before I can go there!

33:44.481 --> 33:47.839
So, OK, you did a V8, a V10,
and then the GT,

33:47.840 --> 33:51.199
and then you did...? What came after that?

33:51.200 --> 33:55.199
After the GT came a Ferrari 458.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.038
And that's still with me now.

33:57.039 --> 33:59.038
That is fan... cos the 458 is...

33:59.039 --> 34:00.638
Are you a big fan of that thing?

34:00.639 --> 34:03.998
I am, yes. That was the first time
that I'd ever sat in a Ferrari.

34:03.999 --> 34:06.198
And, again, I still get that moment

34:06.199 --> 34:09.000
when I see the little prancing horse
and I go,

34:09.001 --> 34:11.839
"No! Definitely not!"

34:11.840 --> 34:13.797
So you pull into a petrol station,

34:13.799 --> 34:16.960
do you get people who make
observations about your car

34:16.960 --> 34:20.079
if you're in the Ferrari?
Yes. All the time.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.518
Like, "I bet you can't get
much in the back of that!"

34:22.518 --> 34:23.598
That's the usual one.

34:23.599 --> 34:25.638
Or, "I bet that costs
a pretty penny to insure!"

34:25.639 --> 34:28.078
And you just think,
"Why are you saying that?!"

34:28.079 --> 34:30.878
Everywhere you go abroad,
people go, "What a lovely car!"

34:30.879 --> 34:32.438
But in Britain, it's always,

34:32.438 --> 34:34.438
"My Maestro does more miles to the gallon."

34:34.438 --> 34:36.400
Yes, but it makes you look like a BLEEP!

34:36.400 --> 34:39.359
Yes, I've had that a few times, actually.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.838
You even got it when you went on
BBC Breakfast News.

34:41.839 --> 34:43.358
I bet you can't remember that.

34:43.359 --> 34:45.277
I can remember it,
because you wrote a column

34:45.279 --> 34:47.998
and you were absolutely raging about it.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.438
I couldn't believe it!

34:49.438 --> 34:52.598
OK, so Amy went on and said,
"I've got a Ferrari 458."

34:52.599 --> 34:55.797
The first question was,
"Well, how much did that cost?"

34:55.799 --> 34:58.638
The next was, "Where can you drive
a car like that in Britain?"

34:58.639 --> 34:59.998
You can drive it everywhere!

34:59.999 --> 35:02.480
Everywhere you drive
your pathetic little Nissan!

35:02.481 --> 35:04.839
I was PROPERLY cross!

35:04.840 --> 35:07.438
I actually said, "I'm going to get
Amy on Top Gear one day"

35:07.439 --> 35:10.720
"and apologise on behalf of the BBC
for its Communist tendencies."

35:10.721 --> 35:13.359
Thank you!

35:13.360 --> 35:16.398
I'll tell you one more car I want to
talk to you about, actually,

35:16.399 --> 35:18.118
which I didn't know that you'd had.

35:18.119 --> 35:19.358
It was a Nissan GTR. Yes.

35:19.359 --> 35:22.040
Because I've never met anybody
who owned one of those.

35:22.041 --> 35:24.479
Did you enjoy it? No.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.640
Really?

35:25.641 --> 35:27.799
Obviously, it's super fast,

35:27.800 --> 35:31.999
but I did feel like I was driving
just a big, plastic box.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.998
Because technically, you look at
all the on-paper stuff...

35:34.999 --> 35:36.838
if you read the car magazines
and you think,

35:36.839 --> 35:38.038
"My God, this is amazing!"

35:38.039 --> 35:40.278
But there is something missing
from it, isn't there?

35:40.279 --> 35:43.438
Yeah, definitely.
And it's very quiet as well.

35:43.439 --> 35:45.240
When I've got something super fast,

35:45.241 --> 35:48.759
I want everyone around me
to know how fast it is!

35:48.760 --> 35:51.718
Did you ever use launch control
on Nissan? I didn't, no.

35:51.719 --> 35:54.398
I think it's definitely
a boy racer's car, though.

35:54.399 --> 35:55.840
What, and you're NOT a boy racer?!

35:55.841 --> 35:57.960
I'm not a boy.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.278
So, really, I mean, I know you said

36:01.279 --> 36:04.038
that this was an ambition,
then, to come down here?

36:04.039 --> 36:06.318
Yeah, totally. Was it fun out there?

36:06.319 --> 36:09.478
It was great fun, yes.
The Stig was brilliant.

36:09.479 --> 36:13.480
I had a good laugh and
I hope I'm not too near the bottom!

36:14.560 --> 36:18.319
Well, the practices
weren't completely perfect.

36:18.320 --> 36:21.039
But they were exciting!

36:21.040 --> 36:22.318
You know when you spin off

36:22.319 --> 36:24.798
and you know you think the cameras
weren't filming you?

36:24.799 --> 36:27.038
Yes, they were? Yeah, they were.

36:27.039 --> 36:29.720
Who'd like to see some of Amy's practices?

36:29.721 --> 36:31.599
Yeah!

36:31.600 --> 36:32.758
Let's have a look.

36:32.759 --> 36:34.240
Right, coming up to...

36:34.241 --> 36:36.999
yes, the second to last corner.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.599
Ooh, yep!

36:39.600 --> 36:41.519
Good one!

36:41.520 --> 36:42.918
That's the follow-through.

36:42.919 --> 36:45.280
That's about 100 miles an hour and...

36:49.080 --> 36:51.680
And kept it going! APPLAUSE.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.120
That's brilliant!

36:57.400 --> 36:59.759
The only person, I think,

36:59.760 --> 37:01.398
who's ever been off there

37:01.399 --> 37:04.078
was Black Stig from years and years back.

37:04.079 --> 37:05.238
Went off in a Vanquish.

37:05.239 --> 37:07.078
It's about 100 miles an hour there.

37:07.079 --> 37:10.798
Yeah, I was caning it, and then
right over all of them lights.

37:10.799 --> 37:13.878
Yeah, the landing lights did suffer
quite badly, actually.

37:13.879 --> 37:17.318
But how did you manage to run wide?
Was it really greasy?

37:17.319 --> 37:20.198
I just think I wasn't paying
attention at that point,

37:20.199 --> 37:23.360
and I suddenly went right off.
But I went off with style.

37:23.361 --> 37:25.599
And you did some damage.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.838
And I love the way you keep your foot down

37:27.839 --> 37:29.360
and keep coming back. Yeah!

37:29.361 --> 37:32.039
So who would like to see the lap?

37:32.040 --> 37:33.479
Yes!

37:33.480 --> 37:35.040
Let's play the tape. Here we go.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.439
Perfect wheel spin.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.600
Burning rubber!

37:45.320 --> 37:47.079
You do look a bit scared.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.080
And a couple of braking points there.

37:49.081 --> 37:52.359
And into the first corner.

37:52.360 --> 37:56.240
Just the right amount of
tyre squeal, and a perfect line.

37:56.241 --> 37:58.399
Follow the road.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.440
Yes, good plan!

38:01.560 --> 38:04.599
Follow it. Get a bit in...

38:04.600 --> 38:07.079
Bang on! Yep, that's looking good.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.160
I'm coming for you, Damien Lewis.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.679
I think I might beat you!

38:11.680 --> 38:13.198
Do you know, I think you might!

38:13.199 --> 38:17.120
He was dealing with quite a lot more
snow and ice than you've got there.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.960
That is nicely judged through there!

38:25.920 --> 38:30.359
My mum's going to have
a heart attack watching this!

38:30.360 --> 38:31.758
Does she get worried? Yeah.

38:31.759 --> 38:33.678
She does? But there's nothing to hit,

38:33.679 --> 38:35.358
except for a few landing lights

38:35.359 --> 38:38.960
and you can't even hit those any
more, because they've gone.

38:38.961 --> 38:43.519
That was very fast through there,
and kept it on the island nicely.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.520
That was, yeah, not even cut there.
No cheating.

38:46.521 --> 38:49.719
And here we are coming up to Gambon.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.520
Again, that is absolutely spot-on,
and across the line.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.840
So, Amy Macdonald...

39:03.480 --> 39:05.680
whereabouts do you think you came?

39:05.681 --> 39:09.999
Erm, I'm hoping it's not
too far near the bottom.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.478
Somewhere in the middle, I'd be happy with.

39:12.479 --> 39:15.158
Somewhere in the middle.
What, the sort of 147 times?

39:15.159 --> 39:18.000
Yeah. I'd be happy with that. Well, well!

39:18.001 --> 39:20.119
You did...

39:20.120 --> 39:21.120
1...

39:21.121 --> 39:23.599
OK, that's good. Not last!

39:23.600 --> 39:24.919
40...

39:26.280 --> 39:27.479
4...

39:27.480 --> 39:29.239
Wow! Point four.

39:29.240 --> 39:32.040
No bad! So I think that is
astonishingly good.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.119
Not bad at all!

39:38.120 --> 39:39.880
Just...

39:40.960 --> 39:42.720
two-tenths behind Tom Cruise!

39:42.721 --> 39:46.439
See, Stig was pushing me on and pushing me.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.798
So he must have known that
I was right near Tom Cruise.

39:48.799 --> 39:50.078
That is an astonishing time.

39:50.079 --> 39:53.118
And to celebrate, we've got
a gift for you to go home with.

39:53.119 --> 39:56.998
Yes, this hasn't happened since
Harry Enfield came here, actually.

39:56.999 --> 40:00.280
But we'd like to present you with
the landing lights you broke.

40:00.281 --> 40:01.679
Aw!

40:01.680 --> 40:04.400
Ladies and gentlemen, Amy MacDonald!

40:07.320 --> 40:09.240
There it is!

40:13.160 --> 40:15.519
Now, tonight we are having a race.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.240
It's between Jeremy Clarkson
in this Mustang

40:18.241 --> 40:20.799
and Richard Hammond and I on trains.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.679
Yes, and we left the action

40:22.680 --> 40:25.119
with Jeremy here, and us two here,

40:25.120 --> 40:29.359
100 miles ahead
and going 100 miles an hour faster.

40:29.360 --> 40:33.040
Yes, now, you don't have to be
a professor of advanced mathematics

40:33.041 --> 40:35.119
to realise that, for once,

40:35.120 --> 40:37.800
Jeremy Clarkson is going to lose.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.238
I suppose it would be cruel, wouldn't it,

40:47.239 --> 40:49.440
to pray for some kind of derailment?

40:49.441 --> 40:51.000
A minor one.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.919
Or a strike.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.120
The French love a strike.

41:02.480 --> 41:08.279
We are now approaching Fontainebleau
at 183 miles an hour.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.879
There's the proof.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.518
I suspect, even with his mighty Mustang,

41:12.519 --> 41:13.680
Jeremy isn't doing that.

41:13.681 --> 41:17.399
'With victory for the train
looking almost certain,

41:17.400 --> 41:20.439
'we now had to tackle a thorny issue.

41:20.440 --> 41:24.840
'There were two of us on it, and
we only had one ticket to the match.'

41:24.841 --> 41:27.239
I like big matches. Do you?

41:27.240 --> 41:28.478
I like going to see a big match.

41:28.479 --> 41:30.838
It's the best thing in the world
to watch. It's fantastic.

41:30.839 --> 41:32.760
So you'd quite like to win this? Yeah.

41:32.761 --> 41:36.439
I'll be honest, I can take it or leave it.

41:36.440 --> 41:37.520
I'd rather leave it.

41:37.521 --> 41:39.239
But in this one instance,

41:39.240 --> 41:41.598
I want to win more than anything else

41:41.599 --> 41:44.680
because I want to deny you and Jeremy
the chance of watching it.

41:44.681 --> 41:46.959
No of fence. That's my thinking.

41:46.960 --> 41:50.359
'Because I wasn't really
in the race at all,

41:50.360 --> 41:52.519
'I was getting distracted.'

41:52.520 --> 41:55.398
This is good. There's
a control on the steering wheel

41:55.399 --> 41:56.798
that allows me to choose

41:56.799 --> 41:59.560
what dial I have
in the middle of the dashboard.

41:59.561 --> 42:01.039
So, I can have volts,

42:01.040 --> 42:03.439
or inlet temperature,

42:03.440 --> 42:05.119
air fuel ratio.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.760
I've got 14 of those.

42:08.600 --> 42:11.118
The problem we have here is that
you and I are competing,

42:11.119 --> 42:15.038
but obviously, what we are engaged
in here is a very lengthy truce.

42:15.039 --> 42:17.038
Yeah, because there's nothing
we can do now.

42:17.039 --> 42:20.920
We are tied together until we get
there and we get off the train.

42:20.921 --> 42:24.279
But the last bit is on foot. Yeah.

42:24.280 --> 42:28.038
Now, I'm quite happy to
run on television. Are you, James?

42:28.039 --> 42:29.878
Well, this is what's bothering me.

42:29.879 --> 42:31.598
The best I can do is come second...

42:31.599 --> 42:34.400
Yes... with my inability
and refusal to run.

42:34.401 --> 42:37.359
Well, you've lost.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.600
I've currently got 11...what is it?

42:39.601 --> 42:41.199
InHgs! 11 inHgs.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.079
No, wait, 20 inHgs.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.838
What's the point of all this?

42:45.839 --> 42:49.120
They may as well tell me
the weather forecast for Adelaide!

42:49.121 --> 42:51.199
'Then there was the radio,

42:51.200 --> 42:52.758
'which could only receive

42:52.759 --> 42:55.040
'frequencies ending in an odd number.'

43:01.520 --> 43:02.839
Happily, though,

43:02.840 --> 43:06.199
the office have provided me
with a talking book

43:06.200 --> 43:08.238
to keep me amused on the long journey.

43:08.239 --> 43:11.598
"He brings his hand up
to grasp my chin"

43:11.599 --> 43:13.120
"and holds me in place."

43:13.121 --> 43:15.839
"He wants me, and I want him."

43:15.840 --> 43:19.199
"He sits down on the edge of the bed."

43:19.200 --> 43:22.439
"'Did you undress me?' I whisper."

43:22.440 --> 43:23.960
"'Yes.'."

43:25.520 --> 43:29.200
Who preceded Alex Ferguson
and manager of Manchester United?

43:29.201 --> 43:30.440
Kenny Dalglish.

43:31.600 --> 43:34.600
Was it? Ron Atkinson?
He's a local builder, isn't he?

43:34.601 --> 43:36.799
Didn't he play Mr Bean?

43:36.800 --> 43:41.199
"Perhaps I imagined it all. No."

43:41.200 --> 43:45.519
"I touched my lips, swollen from his kiss."

43:45.520 --> 43:47.479
"It definitely happened."

43:47.480 --> 43:49.479
In 1969, the year I was born,

43:49.480 --> 43:53.358
which legend scored what was claimed
as his thousandth goal?

43:53.359 --> 43:54.520
George Best.

43:54.521 --> 43:57.480
Peel. Pele?

44:00.640 --> 44:01.880
The miles rolled by

44:01.881 --> 44:06.119
in a relentless blizzard
of fuel stops and sadomasochism.

44:06.120 --> 44:10.399
"Before I know it, he's got
both of my hands on one of his,"

44:10.400 --> 44:13.120
"in a vicelike grip above my head."

44:19.320 --> 44:21.919
'By mid-afternoon, I'd worked out

44:21.920 --> 44:25.240
'why this immensely powerful car
is so cheap.'

44:28.680 --> 44:32.399
Well, it's not what you'd call
lavishly equipped.

44:32.400 --> 44:36.359
The seats, for example, adjust manually.

44:36.360 --> 44:40.558
Then you've got the plastics,
which are HYSTERICALLY terrible.

44:40.559 --> 44:43.480
'And it simply isn't as refined
or as well-engineered

44:43.481 --> 44:47.199
'as anything made in Europe or Japan.'

44:47.200 --> 44:49.879
But it is a likeable car.

44:49.880 --> 44:51.599
It's a good-looking car.

44:51.600 --> 44:53.959
The power is always intoxicating.

44:53.960 --> 44:56.240
You'd never, ever, ever
get bored with that.

44:58.720 --> 45:02.040
'And you do get a lot
of something else as well.

45:02.041 --> 45:04.160
'Heritage.

45:06.240 --> 45:08.159
'This car owes its existence

45:08.160 --> 45:11.320
'to a Texas chicken farmer
called Carroll Shelby.

45:12.880 --> 45:16.079
'He was born in 1923
with a heart condition,

45:16.080 --> 45:18.799
'which meant he lived much of his life

45:18.800 --> 45:22.199
'on a daily dose of nitroglycerine pills.

45:22.200 --> 45:26.560
'That's probably why, one day, he
decided to become a racing driver.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.560
'After not quite making the grade,

45:30.561 --> 45:33.199
'he heard that in little old England,

45:33.200 --> 45:35.199
'a small company called AC

45:35.200 --> 45:39.719
'was struggling to find an engine
for its sports car, the Ace.

45:39.720 --> 45:42.400
'He brokered a deal with Ford
to supply big V8s.

45:42.401 --> 45:47.280
'And what became known as
the AC Cobra was born.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.919
'The Sunday Times reported

45:53.920 --> 45:57.799
'that a coupe version had
achieved 190mph on the M1.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.438
'And the following week,
the Daily Mail said

46:00.439 --> 46:01.880
'this had sparked fury

46:01.881 --> 46:04.959
'with motoring organisations.

46:04.960 --> 46:07.759
'And thanks to the Mail's campaign,

46:07.760 --> 46:10.320
'the 70mph limit was introduced.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.039
'In America, though,

46:15.040 --> 46:18.838
'the Cobra cemented a partnership
between Shelby and Ford.

46:18.839 --> 46:21.678
'A partnership that spawned many great cars

46:21.679 --> 46:24.400
'and lasted right up
until May of last year,

46:24.401 --> 46:27.920
'when at the age of 89, he died.

46:30.520 --> 46:34.719
'Just before he passed away,
though, he got to see this.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.639
'Apparently, he liked it.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.720
'And I like the fact that
it bears his name on the back.'

46:43.880 --> 46:45.720
I was going to say at this point,

46:45.721 --> 46:48.119
"Well, Mr Shelby, wherever you are,"

46:48.120 --> 46:50.320
"my victory today, it's for you."

46:52.160 --> 46:54.359
But I am so far behind,

46:54.360 --> 46:56.720
I just can't bring myself to say it.

46:58.120 --> 47:00.960
However, while I was delivering
my small history lesson,

47:00.961 --> 47:04.119
Ivor the Engine had stopped.

47:04.120 --> 47:07.158
The problem is, as we start to
go into the mountains,

47:07.159 --> 47:08.998
as we make our way towards Italy,

47:08.999 --> 47:11.118
we get onto the old bit of the network.

47:11.119 --> 47:13.558
It has to wind around a bit to go
through cuttings,

47:13.559 --> 47:14.880
and that slows it down.

47:14.881 --> 47:18.599
So we're in a very fast train
on goat paths?

47:18.600 --> 47:21.318
And that's him, and
he's actually moving forward

47:21.319 --> 47:22.678
in big leaps and bounds.

47:22.679 --> 47:25.398
This thing updates itself every
two and a half, three minutes,

47:25.399 --> 47:27.558
so we see Jeremy's progress
as a series of jumps,

47:27.559 --> 47:29.158
and they're bigger than our jumps.

47:29.159 --> 47:30.800
And it's costing us our lead.

47:30.801 --> 47:32.600
It is costing our lead.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.239
Sit rep, I've eaten my last pork pie,

47:39.240 --> 47:41.400
and I've eaten all my sausage rolls.

47:43.040 --> 47:47.239
Richard Hammond is making contact!

47:47.240 --> 47:50.279
Hammond! 'I'm only wanting to ring'

47:50.280 --> 47:53.678
with good news for you. Which is
to say, we appear to be stuck,

47:53.679 --> 47:56.038
'because we have mountains in our way, '

47:56.039 --> 47:58.800
and I haven't seen more than
80mph and we're getting slower.

47:58.801 --> 48:00.639
You're only going 80?

48:00.640 --> 48:03.719
Yes. The gap is closing right now.

48:03.720 --> 48:06.439
'And we haven't been over about 65,'

48:06.440 --> 48:09.238
70, for the last stretch
and we're slowing again.

48:09.239 --> 48:11.158
'Our ETA is still ahead of yours.'

48:11.159 --> 48:13.838
You've still got time to make up,
but you're closing on us,

48:13.839 --> 48:15.518
and that's an unpleasant feeling.

48:15.519 --> 48:18.760
Interesting! Right, well,
thank you for that update.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.279
Better still, because of the Alps,

48:24.280 --> 48:26.278
the train had to take a longer,

48:26.279 --> 48:28.440
southerly route, to reach Milan,

48:28.441 --> 48:30.719
whereas the road was more direct.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.919
I was back in the race.

48:32.920 --> 48:36.798
We are going to scythe
through these mountains, you and me.

48:36.799 --> 48:39.560
Let's do this for Carroll Shelby! Come on!

48:59.000 --> 49:00.718
68. Why isn't it registering 168?

49:00.719 --> 49:03.798
Why is it only saying 68?
Because we're not going that fast.

49:03.799 --> 49:05.520
Why aren't we going that fast?

49:07.040 --> 49:09.039
200 miles, three hours.

49:09.040 --> 49:11.999
Air con, low. Speed, high.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.680
Keep me awake!

49:16.000 --> 49:18.758
Another problem for us
was that in the mountains,

49:18.759 --> 49:21.918
we seemed to be stopping
at every single village.

49:21.919 --> 49:25.240
We'd been stationary
at this one for five minutes.

49:25.241 --> 49:26.679
Excusez-moi.

49:26.680 --> 49:30.879
Cette cinq minutes... c'est
cinq minutes en addition

49:30.880 --> 49:34.439
de la grande totale pour la trip...

49:34.440 --> 49:37.319
or, or, included dans le train.

49:37.320 --> 49:40.078
Je crois qu'on va bientot partir?

49:40.079 --> 49:42.798
Yeah, I don't understand.
Pas tres longtemps.

49:42.799 --> 49:44.478
Yeah, I don't understand the answer.

49:44.479 --> 49:46.118
It's OK. It's OK. Let's just be calm.

49:46.119 --> 49:48.838
There's going to be a pause now
while we wait,

49:48.839 --> 49:50.400
and then we'll rocket away.

49:50.401 --> 49:56.079
He is catching up.
I mean, look at him. Cracking along.

49:56.080 --> 49:59.319
Chamonix Mont Blanc. That'll do me.

49:59.320 --> 50:02.239
I love the signposts you get round here.

50:02.240 --> 50:05.478
It's like I'm driving through
a Robert Ludlum novel.

50:05.479 --> 50:08.760
I'm going to see Jason Bourne
going the other way,

50:08.761 --> 50:10.799
punching people in the face.

50:10.800 --> 50:13.880
And he'll give me a thumbs up
going, "Yeah, go, Mustang!"

50:17.800 --> 50:21.199
45. We're going slower than him.

50:21.200 --> 50:23.440
I'm getting depressed looking at it.

50:23.441 --> 50:28.359
As we trundled through the Alps,
we got a call from Carroll Clarkson.

50:28.360 --> 50:29.679
'Hammond!'

50:29.680 --> 50:31.759
Hello, how are you doing?

50:31.760 --> 50:33.760
'Let me put it to you this way, '

50:33.761 --> 50:35.399
what are you drinking?

50:35.400 --> 50:37.119
Why?!

50:37.120 --> 50:40.078
Because I'm doing really well.
Mont Blanc is straight ahead of me.

50:40.079 --> 50:43.358
You're looking at Mont Blanc?
I'm looking at it. I'm under it.

50:43.359 --> 50:44.878
He's looking at Mont Blanc?

50:44.879 --> 50:46.478
God! He's going great guns.

50:46.479 --> 50:48.120
It's a bit neck and neck.

50:48.121 --> 50:49.599
Yeah, it is.

50:49.600 --> 50:53.639
'But then, my charge
was brought to an abrupt halt.'

50:53.640 --> 50:55.639
God! Contraflow!

50:55.640 --> 50:58.319
That's not funny!

50:58.320 --> 51:00.880
I suppose they're just doing
all the repairs

51:00.881 --> 51:04.279
before the skiing season starts.
Bloody skiers!

51:04.280 --> 51:06.438
Come on, French worker Johnnies!

51:06.439 --> 51:08.078
What numbers are we going to have here?

51:08.079 --> 51:09.478
Hang on, I'll tell you his speed.

51:09.479 --> 51:12.520
I'm going to make a guess
at 74 miles an hour.

51:12.521 --> 51:13.839
70 miles an hour.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.279
I wasn't far off.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.440
No, no, no!

51:18.480 --> 51:21.360
Not again! Please, no more contraflow!

51:30.680 --> 51:32.799
For about 10 glorious minutes,

51:32.800 --> 51:36.598
I thought I was in with a shout of
winning this, but these roadworks...

51:36.599 --> 51:37.720
it is just constant.

51:40.320 --> 51:44.680
'In the Mont Blanc tunnel, I had
seven miles at 40 miles an hour.'

51:46.040 --> 51:49.159
If the Italians aren't doing roadworks

51:49.160 --> 51:51.719
to the same extent as the French,

51:51.720 --> 51:54.119
I am still in with a shout here.

51:54.120 --> 51:57.999
'Meanwhile, far to the south...'

51:58.000 --> 51:59.038
How fast are we going?

51:59.039 --> 52:02.118
Well, we've been touching 100,
and we're accelerating again.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.440
He's not going very fast.

52:03.441 --> 52:07.800
But then, I emerged from the tunnel
onto God's racetrack.

52:09.320 --> 52:11.039
Italy.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.120
You beauty!

52:14.880 --> 52:18.160
The race was now entering
its final, dramatic chapter.

52:20.120 --> 52:24.159
James and Richard would
get into Milan at 6pm.

52:24.160 --> 52:27.080
Then they'd have to cross the city by tube

52:27.081 --> 52:29.839
and cover the last mile on foot,

52:29.840 --> 52:32.400
meaning they'd reach the finish line,

52:32.401 --> 52:35.160
a bar near the stadium, at 7pm.

52:37.480 --> 52:43.919
All the current calculations say
I'm going to arrive at 7.14,

52:43.920 --> 52:47.280
which means I'm only 14 minutes
behind them.

52:48.360 --> 52:50.119
Come on, Mustang!

52:50.120 --> 52:53.079
You are going to beat the train.

52:53.080 --> 52:55.240
Ha-ha!

53:08.720 --> 53:12.799
We peaked at 120 miles an hour
in that last stretch.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.600
That's a tremendous sort of speed.

53:14.601 --> 53:19.000
We might actually just be in with a chance.

53:20.960 --> 53:23.319
I'm 79 miles away.

53:23.320 --> 53:26.400
I've been awake since
two o'clock this morning,

53:26.401 --> 53:28.519
but I'm very, very awake now.

53:28.520 --> 53:30.080
Very determined and awake.

53:33.480 --> 53:36.639
'May!'

53:36.640 --> 53:39.999
Hello, Clarkson.
We're just pulling into Milan.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.080
I wondered what time you thought you
were going to arrive. Just curious.

53:43.081 --> 53:46.279
I reckon I can be there in an hour.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.318
I think we're going to be there
in one hour and four minutes.

53:49.319 --> 53:52.278
May the best man win. It will be you
or Hammond, obviously,

53:52.279 --> 53:53.600
because I can't run. 'Yes.'

53:53.601 --> 53:56.719
Got to go, sorry. 'Bye.'

53:56.720 --> 53:58.519
Come on, Mustang!

53:58.520 --> 54:02.560
You have been the hero of many,
many films in the past.

54:04.760 --> 54:08.160
It's now time to be the hero
in another one.

54:11.200 --> 54:14.080
'In Milan, the San Siro Stadium
was coming to life.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.718
'And on the other side of the city...'

54:17.719 --> 54:19.800
Is that the right bit? Or is that it?

54:19.801 --> 54:22.279
Metro. M. It must be!

54:22.280 --> 54:24.439
'We decided to stick together

54:24.440 --> 54:28.119
'until we dealt with
all the tricky train stuff.'

54:28.120 --> 54:30.200
It's M1. M1 is down there.

54:34.360 --> 54:35.438
Come on!

54:35.439 --> 54:37.640
We missed that by about... Yes, seconds.

54:44.600 --> 54:46.800
Where the hell are we? Garibaldi.

54:46.801 --> 54:48.159
OK, three stops.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.279
What's the name of the bar?

54:50.280 --> 54:51.560
It's the, er...

54:57.600 --> 55:00.480
So it's another train, yeah?
This is a change, isn't it?

55:03.240 --> 55:04.520
It's not this one.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.040
15 miles to go.

55:09.880 --> 55:11.720
I can still do this.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.878
How long are we on this one?

55:16.879 --> 55:19.078
I don't know. I'm trying to work it out.

55:19.079 --> 55:20.120
Come on!

55:22.560 --> 55:25.800
There's Lotto. So it's one, two,
three, four, five stops.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.799
Seven miles.

55:29.800 --> 55:33.400
We've done 807. Seven to go.

55:36.040 --> 55:38.200
You're not going to run? No, I'm not.

55:38.201 --> 55:40.559
But you are? Yes, I am.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.000
Like a stabbed rat.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.200
This is bad traffic!

55:46.600 --> 55:49.678
I am treading on my own tail.
That's what's happening here.

55:49.679 --> 55:51.878
I'm caught up in match day traffic.

55:51.879 --> 55:54.520
Is this us? No, but we're
going the right way. Two more.

55:56.480 --> 56:00.680
That's all the Belgians coming down
to watch their team get annihilated.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.599
I'll be on your side, Belgians!

56:04.600 --> 56:05.918
If you cheer for me now.

56:05.919 --> 56:07.160
Come on, come on, come on!

56:11.960 --> 56:13.118
Right, exit!

56:13.119 --> 56:15.680
'Hammond and I had reached our final stop,

56:15.681 --> 56:18.999
'which meant we were no longer a team.'

56:19.000 --> 56:20.799
Running commences!

56:20.800 --> 56:23.479
Move it! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

56:23.480 --> 56:25.958
'Outside the station,
Hammond scampered off,

56:25.959 --> 56:28.158
'imagining that victory was in the bag,

56:28.159 --> 56:31.400
'But that's because he hadn't seen
what was in mine.'

56:37.320 --> 56:38.478
San Siro!

56:38.479 --> 56:41.640
OK, that's a good sign.

56:41.641 --> 56:42.920
That'll do for me.

56:47.560 --> 56:50.720
Audi man, move! Move!

56:54.920 --> 56:55.960
We're through!

57:05.280 --> 57:07.720
Where's the bar? Where's the bar?

57:21.040 --> 57:23.319
Dov'e' il bar?

57:23.320 --> 57:25.840
Stairs? Yeah, yeah.

57:27.320 --> 57:28.519
Cock!

57:28.520 --> 57:31.399
Loser!

57:31.400 --> 57:34.439
Well done. You look a bit tired, mate!

57:34.440 --> 57:35.798
He's not here, though, is he?

57:35.799 --> 57:37.878
No. So, although you are a loser,

57:37.879 --> 57:39.280
you're not THE loser.

57:39.281 --> 57:42.239
There's a word for what I am. Yeah, smug.

57:42.240 --> 57:45.839
'Moments later, our deluded
colleague arrived.'

57:45.840 --> 57:47.400
Right, where's the ticket?

57:47.401 --> 57:48.600
Jeremy?

57:53.640 --> 57:56.240
Ooh, he's trying this on.
He doesn't like how it fits, does he?

57:56.241 --> 57:58.359
No, no, no! RICHARD LAUGHS.

57:58.360 --> 58:00.119
Well done, chaps.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.918
Be magnanimous! I just was!

58:01.919 --> 58:05.600
I haven't thrown a suitcase at you,
I haven't said, "Cock!"

58:05.601 --> 58:07.359
Well done. We heard you.

58:07.360 --> 58:11.039
Well, that's it, isn't it?
My first ever loss.

58:11.040 --> 58:13.358
800 miles in a Stang.
You've done all right.

58:13.359 --> 58:15.358
It's not a Stang. It's a Mustang.
It's a Stang.

58:15.359 --> 58:17.158
Who won, by the way? I did.

58:17.159 --> 58:18.678
Yeah, he did. By running.

58:18.679 --> 58:21.400
So you're going to watch
a football match? Yes.

58:21.401 --> 58:22.839
All by yourself? Yes.

58:22.840 --> 58:26.440
Do you fancy some nice dinner?
He doesn't even like football.

58:26.441 --> 58:29.159
Where are you? 1A.

58:29.160 --> 58:32.718
Which is at the front, isn't it?
You're actually playing in goal.

58:32.719 --> 58:34.398
I think you ARE actually in the team.

58:34.399 --> 58:36.478
That is the goalkeeper's position. Is it?

58:36.479 --> 58:39.040
Yeah. Is it complicated? Do I need gloves?

58:45.920 --> 58:48.239
No, look. No, no.

58:48.240 --> 58:50.319
I won't blame the tools.

58:50.320 --> 58:53.239
But I will blame the French.

58:53.240 --> 58:56.519
Why? Because it was the French's fault.

58:56.520 --> 59:00.238
Those roadworks, the contraflow,
went on for nearly 100km,

59:00.239 --> 59:03.238
and that is what cost me
the race. Yes, yes.

59:03.239 --> 59:06.320
Well, enough about your embarrassing
and very public failure.

59:06.321 --> 59:10.079
The thing is, what about the car? The car.

59:10.080 --> 59:14.039
Looks great, tons of character,
goes like a train...

59:14.040 --> 59:16.478
No, it doesn't. No, it didn't.
Doesn't go like a train, no.

59:16.479 --> 59:18.680
It goes like a British train.
But there is a problem.

59:18.681 --> 59:21.159
Is there? No, no, really, there is.

59:21.160 --> 59:25.719
Because the biggest advance
with cars in the last 40 years

59:25.720 --> 59:28.319
is not in speed or economy or safety.

59:28.320 --> 59:30.439
It's actually refinement.

59:30.440 --> 59:33.799
You could drive
an old Ford Escort at 70mph,

59:33.800 --> 59:37.678
but if you did, it shaked and
rattled and it wore you out, yes?

59:37.679 --> 59:40.718
Now, a modern-day Ford Focus,
you can drive that that at 70mph

59:40.719 --> 59:42.560
and it's like sitting in the bath.

59:42.561 --> 59:44.839
THIS is like an old Escort.

59:44.840 --> 59:49.639
The noise and vibration
and harshness, it is exhausting!

59:49.640 --> 59:53.038
You're absolutely right. And that is
why American cars are so cheap.

59:53.039 --> 59:55.678
This, the Viper you were driving last week,

59:55.679 --> 59:58.758
the truth is, they simply
aren't as thoroughly engineered

59:58.759 --> 01:00:02.238
as cars from the civilised world.
They're not. They're not.

01:00:02.239 --> 01:00:05.000
And as a result of that,
I arrived at the end of the trip

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:08.799
and I was just a big, soggy bag of skin.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.519
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.120
The thing is, though,
let's not forget... you lost!

01:00:13.121 --> 01:00:14.999
I did.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.320
I did lose. I did lose.
And as a result of that,

01:00:17.321 --> 01:00:20.879
we must finish
on a rather alarming conclusion.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.679
Because of the French,

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.759
the car as a concept is finished.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.798
And on that bombshell, it's time to end.

01:00:27.799 --> 01:00:30.040
Thank you so much for watching. Good night.
