to welcome the widow into

for you, Alice. I'm not asking you.

I know you will not lie to me,
James. I saw Silas.

03:45.665 --> 03:48.465
How is he?
He is Pamunkey now, Alice.

03:49.265 --> 03:52.625
But you did bring a message.
He wants to meet with Henry.

03:52.705 --> 03:57.345
I'll go. He didn't ask to bring you.
Would you stop me going to the
husband I've not seen for months?

is a torment to him,

of making a pigeon of our governor

the most appealing part
of the entire enterprise?

and rattle him so?

I cannot believe you...but I must.

how might he achieve it?

19:26.945 --> 19:28.825
Let me ask Silas that.

19:32.545 --> 19:35.625
Those to be granted land
along the river are...

19:36.545 --> 19:37.985
..Robert Nabb...

19:38.065 --> 19:39.145
(MURMURING)

19:39.225 --> 19:40.305
..Adam Varr...

19:40.385 --> 19:42.225
Sir, I beg your indulgence.

19:44.665 --> 19:47.185
If you men would walk
from a gathering of the Burgesses

19:47.265 --> 19:49.225
because a daughter of
God sits amongst you,

19:49.305 --> 19:51.545
each woman of Jamestown
will spurn this assembly

19:51.625 --> 19:53.945
until that justice is rectified.

19:55.025 --> 19:57.305
Widow. Widow!

19:58.585 --> 20:01.625
I shall see you cast into jail,
should you offend our governor.

20:01.705 --> 20:04.385
Do you consider yourself
above the law, you vile wildcat?!

20:08.065 --> 20:09.425

(CRITTERS CHIRPING)

21:00.945 --> 21:02.145

21:04.985 --> 21:08.265
Take a look along the shoreline,
see if anyone's followed us.

21:14.305 --> 21:15.945
Thank you, Henry.

21:50.305 --> 21:51.465
Henry...

22:00.185 --> 22:01.505
Wait here.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.185
(TWIGS SNAP)

22:15.865 --> 22:17.105
Oh...

22:20.025 --> 22:24.225
Why are you here?
Where is Henry? Is Silas nearby?

22:27.825 --> 22:31.385
Chacrow, I've been a friend to you.

22:31.825 --> 22:35.385
I must speak with Silas.
(BIRDCALLS RING OUT)

22:37.145 --> 22:39.465
Please, Chacrow,
I have a message for him!

(BIRDCALLS CONTINUE)

22:42.665 --> 22:45.025

23:10.345 --> 23:11.545
Silas...

23:17.905 --> 23:19.385
(SOFTLY) I miss you...

23:21.385 --> 23:22.745
..every day.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.425
Never stopped hoping.

23:40.465 --> 23:42.025
I wanted to...

23:44.105 --> 23:47.265
I wanted to meet with Henry,
to tell him that I...

23:48.745 --> 23:51.425
..am going to live
in the faraway mountains.

23:54.105 --> 23:55.345
Oh...

23:58.025 --> 23:59.825
My Silas...

24:02.905 --> 24:06.145
I'm sick with love for you, Alice.

24:07.425 --> 24:11.145
It possesses me as much now
as ever it did,

24:11.225 --> 24:13.625
but I am hunted every day.

24:13.705 --> 24:15.665
Silas, I spoke with the governor.

24:16.425 --> 24:19.785
You can come back. It's true.

24:19.865 --> 24:22.225
He says you must denounce
Opechancanough

24:22.305 --> 24:23.625
and submit yourself to God,

24:23.705 --> 24:27.025
in example to the Pamunkey
that their Gods have failed you.

24:27.585 --> 24:29.425
Silas, you can come back...

24:36.745 --> 24:38.385
(BIRDCALLS RING OUT)

24:54.945 --> 24:56.545
I ain't gonna let them take Silas.

24:58.905 --> 25:00.265
(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)

25:01.265 --> 25:03.905
Ride, Alice. Silas, please,
will you come back?

25:03.985 --> 25:04.985
Sharrow!

25:05.065 --> 25:06.065
Stay down.

25:06.145 --> 25:07.185
Sharrow...

25:12.265 --> 25:14.265
Move. To the river.

25:22.545 --> 25:23.545
Sharrow...

25:31.945 --> 25:33.185
Quick!

25:52.865 --> 25:56.545
All of my senses froze because my
eyes refused to admit what they saw.

25:57.345 --> 26:00.185
An Englishman made painted beast.

26:00.265 --> 26:03.945
Did your men see that it was
Henry who fired upon them?
Can we charge him?

26:05.025 --> 26:07.385
I am thwarted at every quarter.

26:08.585 --> 26:10.945
I will show this town
how authority speaks.

26:11.025 --> 26:15.265
I see such a danger that we
might all be swallowed by
such darkling savagery.

26:17.185 --> 26:20.345
Burn this promise
into my flesh, Doctor,

26:20.425 --> 26:23.625
that every heathen will be
killed before I let that happen.

26:36.785 --> 26:39.505
I pray the Lord knows your
husband well, Lady Yeardley.

26:39.585 --> 26:43.665
I did not have any knowledge
of this trap, Alice. I promise you.

26:44.825 --> 26:47.665
You've taken from me what
Henry Sharrow could not.

26:47.745 --> 26:50.865
You've stolen my best hopes,
my better nature.

26:52.145 --> 26:54.425
You have defeated me.

26:54.985 --> 26:56.305
Alice...

26:58.385 --> 27:00.105
Alice, please...

27:01.425 --> 27:03.105
What will you do?

27:13.105 --> 27:15.385
Ma'am, it's nothing.

27:15.465 --> 27:18.505
I promise...I promise you, I fell.
Tell me, child.

27:18.585 --> 27:20.465
Did Secretary Farlow do this to you?

27:21.225 --> 27:24.025
Ma'am, in a day
the pain will be gone.

27:37.985 --> 27:39.705
Let me be clear, sir,

27:39.785 --> 27:42.865
you may never lay your stick
upon my maid again.

27:42.945 --> 27:44.225
They were clenched.

27:44.305 --> 27:48.425
The two of them, wrapped together
in a way that was ugly.

27:48.505 --> 27:50.385
To your eyes, perhaps.

27:50.465 --> 27:52.825
My mother wrapped herself
into a man that way.

27:54.025 --> 27:56.065
I told the authorities,

27:56.145 --> 27:59.705
and she was made to stand
before the congregation

27:59.785 --> 28:02.225
and admit she was a fornicator.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.825
Nicholas...

28:03.905 --> 28:06.825
I stood in the church that day

28:06.905 --> 28:11.985
and I knew that I had discovered
the polestar of my life.

28:13.545 --> 28:14.865
Hatred.

28:17.785 --> 28:19.745
I'm tired of it now.

28:21.825 --> 28:25.425
I'm tired of Nicholas Farlow.

28:26.185 --> 28:28.665
I met the new factor,
Crabtree, and...

28:30.305 --> 28:32.425
..he saw the corruption in me.

28:32.505 --> 28:35.305
He knew me. Instantly.

28:36.225 --> 28:39.905
And I'm not shocked
by his own rancid smell.

28:45.745 --> 28:49.985
I wish of you to release me from
our collusion against the Governor.

28:50.065 --> 28:53.065
You might keep the
profits from the farm.

28:53.145 --> 28:55.265
I am done with dishonour.

28:56.625 --> 28:59.985
The secretary lashed Mercy
so fiercely and I did nothing!

29:00.785 --> 29:04.145
While he lives, I can hardly
move for the shame of it, Henry.

(GENTLE LULLABY)

29:18.945 --> 29:20.865
I cannot decide for you, Pepper.

29:21.465 --> 29:23.945
But if you do choose to kill
the secretary,

29:24.025 --> 29:27.905
you must know it might be the
last decision you make in this life.

29:29.345 --> 29:32.625
If you do this, be sure to call
his name before you strike...

29:34.105 --> 29:36.385
..that way he knows why he must die.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.425
And he'll take
that knowledge with him to hell.

29:42.185 --> 29:43.425
Look at me.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.425
You kill a man...

29:49.025 --> 29:50.585
..don't lie to yourself.

29:52.385 --> 29:54.785
You'll be a killer
with every breath.

Nicholas, are you also to dine at
the Governor's tonight?

Sir, you are one with care.

Let our scruple tonight be survival.

31:12.465 --> 31:15.145
Pepper, what are you doing?

31:15.825 --> 31:19.465
I hate the man who stood by you
while you were struck and cried out.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.465
OK, I won't be that man,
do you hear me?

31:21.545 --> 31:24.865
I would prefer a man living
and breathing who made one mistake,

31:24.945 --> 31:28.465
one failing,
one slip of his courage,

31:28.545 --> 31:31.665
to a man who takes his pride
with him under the ground.

31:32.585 --> 31:35.345
I want you living, Pepper.

31:37.345 --> 31:39.025
Go to your bed, Mercy.

31:39.105 --> 31:42.905
I will wait for the secretary
and I will rid myself of this shame.

Pepper, please don't. Go on! Pepper!

31:47.705 --> 31:52.225

I have no cause to be kind to you.

31:52.905 --> 31:54.905
But tonight, I do.

31:58.545 --> 32:01.985
It might suit my purpose to grant
some riverside land to you.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.945
Sir, what reason would
you have to favour me?

32:06.025 --> 32:06.985
(LAUGHS)

32:07.065 --> 32:11.825
I admire your fine, crooked dealings
with the secretary against me.

32:12.585 --> 32:16.185
But your secret
partner henceforth will be me.

32:16.265 --> 32:19.385
Governor, you could not believe
that I would dare to deceive you?

32:19.505 --> 32:24.345
The land along the river
is rich, but the Company
would be...dissatisfied

32:24.425 --> 32:26.905
if their governor took too much
for himself,

32:26.985 --> 32:29.185
so you, Jocelyn, will buy it,

32:29.265 --> 32:31.865
and you and I will be
secret partners in the matter.

32:59.265 --> 33:03.745
Jocelyn, you need only name
Farlow as your fellow conspirator.

33:03.825 --> 33:07.985
Sir, if I point my finger at any man
then your finger will point to me.

33:08.065 --> 33:12.025
I saw you together,
secret conference this very night.

33:13.105 --> 33:14.945
Sir, that was merely...

33:15.025 --> 33:18.025
I struck Jocelyn, the widow's maid.

33:18.585 --> 33:22.865
And she...we...sir, it was not
conspiracy that you witnessed.

33:22.945 --> 33:26.185
Jocelyn. You call her Jocelyn.

33:26.265 --> 33:29.065
Sir, speaking in the tavern
is not evidence of conspirators.

33:29.145 --> 33:32.625
But what a misstep it was to present
to me the designs for the windmill

33:32.705 --> 33:35.745
as if you'd snatched them
from her, Farlow.

33:35.825 --> 33:39.345
She sent to England for them.
Look to the lady.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.545
Would she not kick
and scream and bite

33:42.625 --> 33:45.425
before she permitted you
to confiscate anything she valued?

33:54.465 --> 33:57.665

to bring ruin upon you,

feign friendship and respect,

34:59.465 --> 35:03.505
or swear false brotherhood

35:03.585 --> 35:06.345
with a man who deserves
only a sacred hatred.

carry on the veneer

truly wish for

if I'm glad the secretary is dead?

36:55.185 --> 36:57.105
No. What I see now...

36:58.985 --> 37:00.785
..it is not enough.

Never enough to merely survive.

must be utterly felled.

You shame all of us
with your boundless heart.

38:00.185 --> 38:04.185

is that you insist on love.

38:04.265 --> 38:05.745
You demand it.

38:06.985 --> 38:11.185
Where in hell's name
you get such faith from?

38:12.105 --> 38:15.945
Henry, you once told me that no one
can stay here and not be tainted.

38:18.665 --> 38:20.065
So, I must leave.
