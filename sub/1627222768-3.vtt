typically helps me if,

That's what you said when we met
at the General Store.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.939
I told you I was coming here
to be transformed... [sighs]

10:05.939 --> 10:08.108

given that a lot of thought.

No problem. But I can tell you

10:42.142 --> 10:44.144
it's one of our most popular activities.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.230
We've never had a guest
who regretted participating.

CARMEL: You're gonna hit the ceiling!

11:01.745 --> 11:04.456

or do we get to jump in the sack

11:04.456 --> 11:06.041
with somebody else?
'Cause if we do...

11:06.750 --> 11:10.087
I choose Jessica.
I'm gay, but I still choose Jessica.

[chuckles]

11:13.215 --> 11:16.009

My God, they're fierce. [chuckles]

11:17.261 --> 11:19.263
Anyway, so long as it's not Carmel

11:19.263 --> 11:20.681
because you terrify me.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.735
‐ Yes.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.321
‐ There's been an incident.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.739
Carmel attacked Lars.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.618
‐ Physically attacked him?

11:41.618 --> 11:44.663
‐ She lunged for his throat,
but we handled it.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.290
He's with Yao now.

47:53.415 --> 47:54.583
Would you like that?

47:55.417 --> 47:58.337
Want me to roll up a newspaper
and come to your room later?

47:59.338 --> 48:00.339
‐ Tempting.

48:00.339 --> 48:03.383
[indistinct chatter]

48:06.720 --> 48:09.389
[indistinct chatter]

48:13.852 --> 48:16.522
NAPOLEON: Look at this.
TONY: The goat, too.

48:16.522 --> 48:18.190
NAPOLEON: That is...

48:18.190 --> 48:22.110
That is a lot of meat.
[laughs] Impressive.

48:22.110 --> 48:23.403
TONY:
There's no such thing as white meat.

48:23.403 --> 48:25.614
[speaking in Russian]

48:25.614 --> 48:31.453
‐ Welcome.
Here is to a successful Earth Day.

48:31.828 --> 48:36.792
I hear there was many
positive unearthings today.

48:36.792 --> 48:38.085
Many truths were told.

48:39.044 --> 48:43.882
Here's to revealing ourselves
and giving of ourselves.

48:43.882 --> 48:45.467
‐ Hear, hear!
TONY: I'm down.

48:45.467 --> 48:46.718
To the truth, nothing but.

48:47.886 --> 48:50.973
‐ Would anyone else like to say
a blessing before we eat?

48:50.973 --> 48:53.392
‐ [chuckles] What about
a eulogy for the goat?

48:53.392 --> 48:56.979
He gave his life
so that we may rejoice tonight?

48:56.979 --> 48:58.313
It's the least we can do.

48:58.313 --> 49:00.524
‐ I don't think the goat
was a willing participant.

49:00.524 --> 49:03.360
He didn't give anything.
He was slaughtered.

49:03.360 --> 49:04.444
‐ I‐‐ I'll go.

49:05.696 --> 49:09.575
MASHA:
Yes, Napoleon, please. Speak to us.

49:10.826 --> 49:12.077
NAPOLEON: All right.

49:16.790 --> 49:19.334
Leviticus 4.
Anybody, uh, remember that one?

49:23.922 --> 49:28.760
When you, uh, sin,
mind you, unintentionally sin.

49:29.970 --> 49:32.139
Leviticus 4:23.

49:32.139 --> 49:34.099
‐ Honey? What...

49:34.099 --> 49:38.228
‐ Out there, uh, celebrating
the Earth, first I heard...

49:40.147 --> 49:42.357
ringing, like bells...

49:43.984 --> 49:47.529
in my head, in my ears. Bells.

49:47.529 --> 49:49.239
‐ Dad?

49:49.239 --> 49:50.490
‐ I'm saying grace, Zoe.

49:51.575 --> 49:54.161
And then I heard it.

49:54.161 --> 49:58.040
Leviticus 4:23. Screaming...

50:00.000 --> 50:02.169
"If his sin is made known to him,

50:03.128 --> 50:05.088
"he shall bring for his offering...

50:06.673 --> 50:07.716
"a goat.

50:08.383 --> 50:10.636
"A male without defect.

50:10.636 --> 50:14.306
"He shall lay his hand
on the head of the male goat...

50:15.891 --> 50:16.850
"and slay it.

50:18.435 --> 50:20.103
And offer it before the Lord."

50:21.939 --> 50:22.898
‐ Napoleon.

50:27.945 --> 50:29.821
‐ You know, the thing about suicide.

50:31.281 --> 50:33.867
Uh, so often there are no signs.

50:33.867 --> 50:36.203
There's hardly an inclination, even.

50:36.203 --> 50:37.704
Especially with teenage suicide,

50:37.704 --> 50:39.122
it can be the consequence of a,

50:40.082 --> 50:42.793
uh, split‐second decision.

50:42.793 --> 50:45.963
An impulse as little as minutes
before it happens.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.927
I mean, isn't that‐‐
isn't that incredible?

50:53.345 --> 50:54.763
And here's the other thing.

50:55.430 --> 51:00.602
Suicide survivors often report
that their first thought

51:01.603 --> 51:03.689
after they swallow the pills,

51:04.523 --> 51:06.859
or jump, or cut themselves,

51:07.818 --> 51:10.696
first thought, "My God, what have I done?"

51:12.197 --> 51:14.032
Sometimes if the attempt
is thwarted, the‐‐

51:14.032 --> 51:16.618
the suicidal thoughts,
they never even return.

51:27.171 --> 51:30.591
Zach... was, uh...

51:32.426 --> 51:34.386
uh, impulsive.

51:34.386 --> 51:36.346
He was always so impulsive,
wasn't he, Zoe?

51:36.346 --> 51:40.559
[gasps] Uh, me and him,
we were up the night before.

51:40.559 --> 51:42.936
We were watching The Royal Tenenbaums.

51:42.936 --> 51:45.230
We really loved that movie. And, um,

51:45.230 --> 51:46.982
we stayed up a little too late
watching it.

51:46.982 --> 51:50.235
And, uh, that's‐‐ that's why I was‐‐

51:50.235 --> 51:52.029
I was tired the next morning.

51:52.029 --> 51:55.032
And that's why I hit

51:55.032 --> 51:57.701
the snooze button on my iPhone...

51:57.701 --> 51:59.912
[sniffles] ...when the alarm went off.

52:01.747 --> 52:03.498
Instead I was woken up by your scream

52:03.498 --> 52:06.001
after you found him two minutes
after he hung himself.

52:06.835 --> 52:10.714
So, um, if I‐‐ if I...

52:12.132 --> 52:13.842
if I had gotten up when I should have,

52:15.093 --> 52:18.722
when my alarm went off,
if I'd gone into his room

52:18.722 --> 52:21.225
and woke him up like I always do...

52:22.935 --> 52:24.436
"Up and at '‘em, buddy."

52:31.944 --> 52:36.615
You wouldn't be broken.
And, uh, you'd still sing in the shower.

52:36.615 --> 52:38.075
You'd be celebrating your‐‐

52:38.075 --> 52:40.786
your 21st birthday with your brother.

52:40.786 --> 52:43.455
[Zoe sobs]

52:48.126 --> 52:49.837
I killed that goat.

52:49.837 --> 52:53.298
If‐‐ I went to save him,
I grabbed him away from Tony,

52:54.299 --> 52:56.677
and then, uh, Leviticus.

52:58.887 --> 53:02.891
"He shall lay his hand
on the head of a male goat..."

53:03.851 --> 53:07.312
[Napoleon grunts]

53:07.312 --> 53:12.192
"...and slay it,
and offer it before the Lord."

53:12.192 --> 53:17.239
It's unintentional‐‐ an unintentional sin.

53:18.407 --> 53:21.410
[sobs] If I had just gotten up.

53:21.410 --> 53:23.036
[groans] If I had just gotten up.

53:24.413 --> 53:25.706
[Heather sobs]

53:29.626 --> 53:32.379
God. [cries]

53:36.717 --> 53:38.260
[exhales]

53:41.597 --> 53:43.015
[sniffles]
