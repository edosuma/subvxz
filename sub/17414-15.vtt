00:01.367 --> 00:05.067
This is my boss,
Charles Bartowski.

00:05.133 --> 00:06.733
<i>A computer repairman
with all the</i>

00:06.734 --> 00:09.033
<i>government's secrets
in his head.</i>

00:13.901 --> 00:16.234
<i>This is his girl, Sarah Walker.</i>

00:16.300 --> 00:18.701
<i>A CIA agent with more
than just killer looks.</i>

00:22.634 --> 00:24.901
<i>And when these
two spies first met,</i>

00:24.968 --> 00:27.300
<i>it was love at first fight.</i>

00:37.901 --> 00:39.466
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

00:39.467 --> 00:41.066
<i>I'm Morgan.
It's my job</i>

00:41.067 --> 00:42.933
<i>to keep an eye
on the both of them,</i>

00:42.934 --> 00:45.067
<i>which isn't always easy.</i>

01:03.434 --> 01:04.967
Oh, hey, dude.

01:04.968 --> 01:06.399
I had the most
incredible dream, man.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.300
I was, uh...
Hey.

01:08.968 --> 01:10.666
Uh, do you want some?

01:10.667 --> 01:12.567
Hello? Morgan?

01:13.701 --> 01:15.199
Hi.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.600
Do you want some orange juice?

01:16.601 --> 01:18.934
Orange juice?
Orange juice.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.466
Absolutely.
Man, that sounds good.

01:20.467 --> 01:21.466
Vitamin Ds are

01:21.467 --> 01:22.967
very important-
Vitamin Cs.

01:22.968 --> 01:24.032
Vitamin C, singular.

01:24.033 --> 01:26.567
Great.
Sorry.

01:26.634 --> 01:28.233
The jug's so big.

01:28.234 --> 01:30.767
Jug- I'm sorry, I...

01:30.834 --> 01:33.267
I hate you, Chuck.
I hate you.

01:38.367 --> 01:39.466
Good morning, buddy.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.166
Okay, I get it.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.633
You're having tons
and tons of sex.

01:42.634 --> 01:43.967
Congratulations, Warren Beatty.

01:43.968 --> 01:45.399
Who said anything about...

01:45.400 --> 01:46.900
Your big, goofy grin
said it, okay?

01:46.901 --> 01:48.666
And, you know, it's kind of
an insult for those of us

01:48.667 --> 01:49.867
living in the apartment
who aren't having sex.

01:49.868 --> 01:52.133
Which is me.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.300
Sorry. Sorry about that.

01:54.367 --> 01:55.733
I'm just really happy.

01:55.734 --> 01:56.999
Well, duh. You're dating

01:57.000 --> 01:58.366
a leggy Valkyrie who has
an aversion to clothing.

01:58.367 --> 01:59.900
Says the guy who likes to sleep

01:59.901 --> 02:01.299
in the nude.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.566
Au buffo.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.233
Oh, well, I'll have you
know that I've actually

02:04.234 --> 02:06.367
made the very painful concession
of wearing pajamas.

02:06.434 --> 02:07.867
I mean, you never know

02:07.868 --> 02:09.500
when she's going to be
stopping by now and...

02:09.501 --> 02:11.401
Well, I think you can pretty
much count on Sarah being here

02:11.467 --> 02:13.032
every night,
because I'm about to ask her

02:13.033 --> 02:14.533
if she wants to move in.

02:14.534 --> 02:17.267
Okay. Well, you two
probably have a lot

02:17.334 --> 02:19.234
to talk about.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.066
Hi.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.333
I was going to surprise you.

02:25.334 --> 02:26.666
Take you out to a nice dinner

02:26.667 --> 02:28.734
and give you your own key.

02:28.801 --> 02:30.566
But...

02:30.567 --> 02:32.501
How would you like to move in?

02:32.567 --> 02:35.067
Why would we do that?

02:36.634 --> 02:37.967
Why? Well,

02:37.968 --> 02:40.501
because I figured since
you're sleeping here

02:40.567 --> 02:41.800
most nights anyway...

02:41.801 --> 02:43.066
We're not a normal couple,

02:43.067 --> 02:45.400
so why do we need to pretend
like we have a normal life?

02:45.467 --> 02:46.633
Who's pretending?

02:46.634 --> 02:48.299
Okay, I, I didn't mean it
like that.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.133
I love working with you
and I love being with you, so...

02:51.200 --> 02:53.234
Why mess with
a good thing, right?

02:54.267 --> 02:55.666
We can talk more after work.

02:55.667 --> 02:56.967
Right, yeah.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.500
Yeah, we'll talk
more after work,

02:58.501 --> 03:00.601
'cause I know how good

03:00.667 --> 03:01.833
a thing this is.

03:01.834 --> 03:02.967
What are you doing?

03:02.968 --> 03:05.067
Well, I left my gun
in my hotel room.

03:05.133 --> 03:08.300
No, what are you doing,
storing your guns in my couch?

03:08.367 --> 03:10.734
Morgan
Morgan could find those. What, you've not heard

03:10.801 --> 03:11.867
of the 30-foot rule?

03:11.868 --> 03:13.868
As a matter of fact,
no, I have not.

03:13.934 --> 03:16.567
A good agent should never be
without a backup weapon.

03:16.634 --> 03:18.066
Well, have you ever
heard of the Bartowski rule?

03:18.067 --> 03:19.666
No firearms in my apartment.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.367
Well, not if you want
to live with a spy.

03:23.934 --> 03:26.067
<i>Hey, Chuck. Got your message.</i>

03:26.133 --> 03:27.733
<i>Everything is fine.</i>

03:27.734 --> 03:29.634
<i>Sorry we can't talk.
We're moving to a new clinic.</i>

03:29.701 --> 03:30.867
<i>We're here, babe.</i>

03:30.868 --> 03:33.567
Hang up.
Love you. Bye.

03:38.601 --> 03:40.333
Excuse me,
Doctors Without Borders.

03:40.334 --> 03:42.634
Any idea where
the field clinic is?

03:42.701 --> 03:44.601
Nothing?

03:45.701 --> 03:48.300
Babe, I think
this is the clinic.

03:48.367 --> 03:49.933
Honey, I have seen
more patients

03:49.934 --> 03:51.834
in two weeks than
I've seen in my first

03:51.901 --> 03:53.366
few years as a doctor.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.566
You have any idea

03:54.567 --> 03:56.132
who the men with the guns are?

03:56.133 --> 03:57.633
The UN wear blue berets

03:57.634 --> 03:59.667
and the FDLR wear black berets.

03:59.734 --> 04:02.667
Great, but Devon, these guys
aren't wearing any berets.

04:02.734 --> 04:04.066
Hey. Hey.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.967
Whoever they are,
they're in charge.

04:07.467 --> 04:10.267
Honey, what have we gotten ourselves
into? Remember what they said

04:10.334 --> 04:12.166
about this being the toughest
job you'll ever love?

04:12.167 --> 04:13.999
We're making a difference.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.701
I know, I know.
That's not what's getting to me.

04:16.767 --> 04:18.901
What's getting to me
is the not showering

04:18.968 --> 04:20.099
and the not sleeping
and the not knowing

04:20.100 --> 04:21.565
who the men with the guns are.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.467
Hmm?

04:24.567 --> 04:26.333
Well, how about a date night?

04:26.334 --> 04:27.900
I'll cook dinner
for you tonight.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.868
Just you and me under the stars.

04:29.934 --> 04:31.834
Okay.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.433
I'm sure it'll
clear up any minute.

04:34.434 --> 04:35.433
Mm, mwa.

04:35.434 --> 04:37.099
You're my boy.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.500
Over here!
Follow me.

04:38.501 --> 04:39.833
You're in charge.

04:39.834 --> 04:40.999
<i>What do you mean</i>

04:41.000 --> 04:42.166
"we're not in charge"?

04:42.167 --> 04:44.267
Are you demoting us, General?
No.

04:44.334 --> 04:46.801
You will be acting
in an observational capacity

04:46.868 --> 04:48.099
on this mission.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.466
The primary agents

04:49.467 --> 04:51.534
are named
Craig and Laura Turner.

04:51.601 --> 04:53.333
Never heard of them.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.132
AKA George and Bitsy
Witherspoon?

04:55.133 --> 04:56.366
The CIA team who stopped

04:56.367 --> 04:58.267
the Air France
hijacking in '86?

04:58.334 --> 05:00.300
AKA John and Suzie Smythe?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.334
The ones who broke up
the Uranium smuggling ring

05:02.400 --> 05:03.566
back in '91.

05:03.567 --> 05:05.433
I could go on and on

05:05.434 --> 05:07.767
listing the Turner's aliases
and accomplishments.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.566
So, they've been
around the CIA block.

05:09.567 --> 05:10.833
Well, that's good for them

05:10.834 --> 05:13.501
They have also been married
for the last 30 years-

05:13.567 --> 05:14.733
more or less.

05:14.734 --> 05:18.501
And this is
relevant to us, how?

05:18.567 --> 05:20.634
As long as you
and Agent Bartowski insist

05:20.701 --> 05:22.433
on keeping a personal
relationship,

05:22.434 --> 05:25.234
I insist you learn
how to go about it properly.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.634
Your mission is to watch
and learn from the best

05:27.701 --> 05:29.634
couple the CIA
has ever produced.

05:29.701 --> 05:31.333
Hmm.

05:31.334 --> 05:32.399
And you, Colonel Casey...

05:32.400 --> 05:34.801
I'll head on down to Pendleton,

05:34.868 --> 05:36.233
recertify my weapons training.

05:36.234 --> 05:38.634
<i>It's not your training
that concerns me.</i>

05:38.701 --> 05:40.701
I'm talking about Morgan Grimes.

05:40.767 --> 05:42.801
It was your idea to make him
a part of the team.

05:42.868 --> 05:46.000
It's your job to make him
field-ready.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.833
You can't be serious, General.

05:47.834 --> 05:49.533
He's a diamond in the rough-

05:49.534 --> 05:52.767
very, very rough,
but I'm sure you'll make him

05:52.834 --> 05:55.167
sparkle.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.534
Diamond.

05:59.767 --> 06:01.667
Diamond in the rough...

06:05.200 --> 06:06.967
Would you please sit down?

06:06.968 --> 06:08.132
You're making me nervous.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.933
The Turners are going
to be here any minute.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.199
What, you've never met

06:11.200 --> 06:13.267
a CIA agent before?
You, what- come on.

06:13.334 --> 06:14.800
You heard Beckman- these guys

06:14.801 --> 06:16.533
are the best of the best.
They're a super spy couple.

06:16.534 --> 06:19.234
I don't want them thinking
we're a couple of rubes.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.501
What a dump!

06:21.567 --> 06:23.767
Can you imagine being
stationed here?

06:23.834 --> 06:26.434
Remember when the CIA
held rooms for us

06:26.501 --> 06:28.299
at the Grand Ambassador?

06:28.300 --> 06:31.067
Ah, the salad days!

06:32.334 --> 06:33.633
What'd you say
their names were again?

06:33.634 --> 06:36.267
I believe their names are
Bertruski or Bertrowski.

06:36.334 --> 06:38.066
Something ethnic.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.266
Two young agency hotshots.

06:39.267 --> 06:41.400
And they're here.
And they're here!

06:48.000 --> 06:52.234
Dear God, it's us 30 years ago.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.367
Look, Sarah,
that's us in 30 years.

06:57.746 --> 07:03.135
Transcript by www.addic7ed.com

07:38.834 --> 07:41.133
So there you have it:
Operation Mongoose.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.667
Made it out of Berlin
with half the KGB

07:43.734 --> 07:46.100
on my tail. If it hadn't
been for that woman

07:46.167 --> 07:48.534
in the fur coat
with the AK-47...

07:48.601 --> 07:50.166
Enough with the Cold War
stories,

07:50.167 --> 07:51.600
darling...

07:51.601 --> 07:52.766
You're boring our hosts.

07:52.767 --> 07:53.900
No-no, no.

07:53.901 --> 07:56.434
This is, this is,
this is fascinating, uh,

07:56.501 --> 07:58.233
to me at-at least.

07:58.234 --> 08:01.000
A toast, Charles,
to old spy stories.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.000
Oh, Mrs. Turner,
can I get you a drink?

08:03.067 --> 08:05.234
No, thank you.
I'm fine

08:05.300 --> 08:07.166
with my water.

08:07.167 --> 08:10.100
The wife does not partake,
so I guess I'll just have

08:10.167 --> 08:12.067
to toast for both of us.

08:14.734 --> 08:17.868
A serviceable Manhattan,
Charles.

08:19.534 --> 08:21.701
Is there something wrong
with your cherry?

08:21.767 --> 08:23.934
Actually, a true
Manhattan is made

08:24.000 --> 08:26.934
with a rare and delicate
marasca cherry...

08:28.167 --> 08:29.433
The only place
you can find those,

08:29.434 --> 08:31.166
here in LA would be...

08:31.167 --> 08:33.267
The Grand Ambassador.
The Grand Ambassador.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.500
Don't be a booze snob,

08:34.501 --> 08:36.099
darling.
Getting back to your

08:36.100 --> 08:38.000
story, though,
the woman in the fur coat,

08:38.033 --> 08:39.700
I'm assuming, was you,
Mrs. Turner?

08:39.701 --> 08:42.299
Mm. That's how
the two of you met?

08:42.366 --> 08:43.366
How we got divorced.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.434
The hussy in the fur was

08:45.501 --> 08:46.633
a Russian double agent.

08:46.634 --> 08:48.333
I thought the two of
you were married.

08:48.334 --> 08:50.099
Remarried- three times.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.000
Some women are too special

08:52.067 --> 08:53.967
to marry just once.

08:55.901 --> 08:58.167
My, look at the time.

08:58.234 --> 08:59.999
Goodness, we'd
better get going.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.867
Oh, so soon?

09:01.868 --> 09:03.901
This has been just great.

09:03.968 --> 09:05.868
Sarah and I cannot wait
to work with the two of you.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.199
Oh, you won't have to.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.900
The mission is
tonight, Charles.

09:08.901 --> 09:11.033
The target is Otto Von Vogel.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.299
Otto has created

09:12.300 --> 09:14.200
a decryption program

09:14.234 --> 09:16.767
that could render
CIA security useless.

09:16.834 --> 09:19.267
Tonight's party is
a smoke screen for him

09:19.334 --> 09:21.834
to meet potential buyers.
Our job is to access

09:21.901 --> 09:24.667
Otto's master suite,
where he stores the software.

09:24.734 --> 09:26.233
Okay, great. What do
you want us to do?

09:26.234 --> 09:27.500
Your job:

09:27.501 --> 09:29.534
Watch and learn.

09:31.234 --> 09:33.601
I can't wait to watch
these two in action.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.901
It is going to be great.

09:35.968 --> 09:37.500
What?

09:37.501 --> 09:39.132
So what are Chuck
and Sarah up to tonight?

09:39.133 --> 09:41.200
Some sort of sexy
spy dinner party?

09:41.267 --> 09:43.801
Shh!
Oh, right. Sorry, sorry.

09:43.868 --> 09:45.533
I don't know.
You ask me, this whole

09:45.534 --> 09:47.233
man gig's starting to become a real snore, you know?

09:47.234 --> 09:49.834
When am I going to put the hurt on
some terrorist? You know, get in there?

09:49.901 --> 09:52.000
Whatever it is
you think you know

09:52.067 --> 09:55.267
about being a spy,
you're wrong, hmm?

09:55.334 --> 09:58.033
Oh, oh...
Okay.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.600
You're a child.

09:59.601 --> 10:01.266
You're a liability to the team.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.167
You're not doing anything until
you've been properly trained.

10:03.168 --> 10:04.466
Understood?

10:04.467 --> 10:05.766
Wait a minute-
does that mean...?

10:05.767 --> 10:06.933
I can't believe
I'm going to say this.

10:06.934 --> 10:08.132
I'm going to Langley!

10:08.133 --> 10:10.634
You're not going
anywhere, jackass.

10:10.701 --> 10:12.066
I can teach you everything
you need to know

10:12.067 --> 10:13.967
right here in the store.
Come on.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.868
Oh, yeah. Start with the neck
thing. That was awesome!

10:23.601 --> 10:26.367
So, that's Otto, I take it.

10:26.434 --> 10:28.132
Avoid him and his guards.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.701
If anyone asks
who you are, tell them

10:30.767 --> 10:32.399
you're our nephew, Bernard.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.800
Actually, tell them
she's our niece.

10:33.801 --> 10:34.967
No offense, Charles.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.868
No, none taken.

10:37.634 --> 10:39.099
Shall we work the room first?

10:39.100 --> 10:41.000
After you, my love.

10:41.901 --> 10:43.801
Here we go.

10:45.767 --> 10:47.533
How's the tennis elbow, Monty?

10:47.534 --> 10:48.999
Can I give you
a word of advice?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.299
Eat and rest.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.766
You see, consummate
professionals.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.968
I mean, what do you think makes
them such a great spy team?

10:54.033 --> 10:56.367
Um, a lifetime of training.

10:56.434 --> 10:58.701
Very funny. I'm talking
about them being a couple.

10:58.767 --> 11:00.566
I honestly can't
believe the CIA

11:00.567 --> 11:01.999
doesn't hire more of us.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.334
They're not that great.
Oh, don't be jealous.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.267
I'm not jealous. I'm just saying
they're not that great.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.534
Sarah, we, uh, we may
have a slight problem.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.634
There you are Otto, old boy!

11:18.701 --> 11:19.933
We heard you were in town

11:19.934 --> 11:21.533
and assumed you were
having a party.

11:21.534 --> 11:24.968
I don't recall putting
you two on the guest list.

11:27.434 --> 11:28.800
I'm just kidding.

11:28.801 --> 11:30.701
Look at your faces!

11:31.501 --> 11:33.601
Oh, Otto, you are terrible.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.234
As they say in my country,

11:36.300 --> 11:38.968
<i>"mein Haus ist ihr Haus."</i>

11:40.367 --> 11:42.968
Textbook subversion.
Not bad.

11:43.033 --> 11:45.133
You know, we could take a page

11:45.200 --> 11:47.667
out of the Turners' playbook.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.267
You're not going to ask me to
move in with you again, are you?

11:51.268 --> 11:54.167
No, why... Well,
not now. Maybe later.

11:55.767 --> 11:58.067
At ease.

11:58.133 --> 11:59.733
All right, there
are three qualities

11:59.734 --> 12:01.299
that make for
an effective field agent:

12:01.300 --> 12:02.299
Subversion, Me.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.299
Stealth...
Me.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.501
Strength...

12:05.567 --> 12:06.666
First things first.

12:06.667 --> 12:09.367
See that customer over there?

12:10.868 --> 12:12.533
Oh, my goodness-
super-hottie?

12:12.534 --> 12:14.132
Yeah, I clocked her
when she first came in.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.566
I want you to get
her phone number.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.466
Yeah, right.

12:17.467 --> 12:18.700
No, seriously,
what's the first step?

12:18.701 --> 12:19.933
A spy must be able

12:19.934 --> 12:21.934
to manipulate any target
at any time.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.800
In the field, it can make
the difference

12:23.801 --> 12:24.967
between life and death.

12:24.968 --> 12:27.567
Copy that. Yes, sir.

12:27.634 --> 12:29.066
Ooh, what about her, though?

12:29.067 --> 12:30.700
Silver-tops
really eat me up.

12:30.701 --> 12:32.601
You have your target. Engage.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.567
* *

12:46.334 --> 12:48.834
Get on with it.

12:53.901 --> 12:55.801
Hmm.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.100
Target has been neutralized.

13:03.467 --> 13:05.434
I thought Bartowski
was hopeless.

13:13.534 --> 13:15.434
* *

13:20.400 --> 13:22.334
Well, I'm not sure
where the Turners went.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.300
Maybe they already
made their move.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.033
I thought she said
she didn't drink?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.100
Yeah.

13:32.534 --> 13:34.366
Hit me.

13:34.367 --> 13:37.868
Hi. Hi,
Mrs. Turner, uh...

13:37.934 --> 13:40.300
Sarah and I were just
wondering if the mission

13:40.367 --> 13:42.634
is still going
according to plan.

13:42.701 --> 13:44.099
Is, um, something wrong?

13:44.100 --> 13:45.233
Her.

13:45.234 --> 13:47.767
It's disgusting.

13:47.834 --> 13:50.100
Man's old enough
to be her father!

13:50.167 --> 13:53.634
Perhaps he's just giving
her some fatherly advice?

13:53.701 --> 13:55.366
Bastard left his Mic on.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.000
CRAIG
You are a very, naughty girl.

13:58.067 --> 14:00.167
It's too bad my wife is here.

14:00.234 --> 14:03.434
Perhaps we can hook up
later at my hotel?

14:03.501 --> 14:06.634
The man's nothing but
a CIA-sanctioned gigolo.

14:06.701 --> 14:09.467
Oh... you don't
mean that.

14:10.701 --> 14:12.032
Oh, wait, uh,

14:12.033 --> 14:13.166
where, where are you going?

14:13.167 --> 14:15.100
Upstairs to steal the software.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.633
At least one of us

14:16.634 --> 14:18.534
is still a professional.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.333
I'll handle this.

14:24.334 --> 14:25.766
Here, let me...
Get...

14:25.767 --> 14:28.133
Get your hands off me!
Please, you're fighting me.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.833
Don't touch me!
You're making a scene.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.333
Don't touch me!

14:31.334 --> 14:32.766
Dear Lord, my back.

14:32.767 --> 14:33.933
Oh, this is not good.

14:33.934 --> 14:35.733
It's an old service injury.

14:35.734 --> 14:38.300
Oh, you threw your back out
with a Havana hooker.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.734
It was all in the line of
duty, my dear. Oh, right, yeah.

14:40.801 --> 14:42.700
Give us a moment.
Don't even start with me.

14:42.701 --> 14:44.667
It will fix itself-
the back, not her.

14:44.734 --> 14:46.566
We should get out of here

14:46.567 --> 14:49.100
before they blow
all of our covers.

14:49.167 --> 14:51.300
Don't touch me!

14:51.367 --> 14:52.867
What about the software?

14:52.868 --> 14:55.334
Let's show the Turners
how it's done, hmm?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.534
Is there a nurse here?

14:57.601 --> 15:00.033
Someone in a short skirt?

15:03.434 --> 15:06.467
Master suite.
Master suite...

15:06.534 --> 15:08.534
Master suite.
Yeah.

15:13.534 --> 15:15.801
Otto's safe
has to be around here

15:15.868 --> 15:17.934
somewhere.

15:19.734 --> 15:21.634
<i>Gesundheit.
Thank you.</i>

15:21.701 --> 15:23.299
There's got to be
a cat around here.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.300
My allergies are going crazy.

15:25.367 --> 15:28.834
Whoa. Hey! Look at this!

15:30.000 --> 15:31.199
Our buddy, Otto, into some

15:31.200 --> 15:33.901
kinky stuff,
even by German standards.

15:37.968 --> 15:39.433
Chuck?

15:39.434 --> 15:40.600
Yeah?

15:40.601 --> 15:42.501
Put the whip down.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.067
Why?

16:01.900 --> 16:03.800
Not a fan of the whip,
are you, big fella?

16:09.867 --> 16:13.200
I'll just put this away and let
you get back to your cat nap.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.167
Ow, gee!

16:28.601 --> 16:29.932
Chuck!
Mm-hmm?

16:29.933 --> 16:30.932
Run!

16:30.933 --> 16:32.833
Yeah, go, go, go, go!

16:34.301 --> 16:35.500
The software-

16:35.501 --> 16:37.401
the software is
on the tiger's collar.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.000
Get the chair.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.166
If I just had my tranq gun.

16:43.167 --> 16:45.066
No, no, that's not a tranq gun.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.233
I am not letting
you shoot a tiger.

16:46.234 --> 16:47.767
They are endangered
and majestic.

16:47.768 --> 16:49.967
Do you have any better ideas?
I think what we need

16:50.034 --> 16:52.067
to be asking ourselves
is what would the Turners do?

16:52.134 --> 16:53.533
<i>Survive in the field,</i>

16:53.534 --> 16:55.366
an agent also has
to employ stealth.

16:55.367 --> 16:56.500
Good. Done-
are you kidding me?

16:56.501 --> 16:57.600
I move like a cat.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.534
I want you to steal
something for me.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.999
Look at these hands-
small and nimble.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.134
Steal anything in the store.
Look at this. Boom. Done.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.366
I got...
No!

17:04.367 --> 17:05.500
I have something a little

17:05.501 --> 17:07.401
more difficult in mind.

17:08.601 --> 17:10.098
Oh, come on, really?

17:10.099 --> 17:11.465
Suck it up.

17:11.467 --> 17:13.534
Target acquired.

17:13.601 --> 17:15.465
Okay, okay,
the Turners aren't perfect.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.098
I'm willing
to modify my opinion.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.532
She's a drunk
and he's a philanderer.

17:18.534 --> 17:20.098
As a team, they're a total mess.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.134
Well, come on, they're not
completely without their charms.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.267
I mean, there could be worse
people that we could turn into.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.233
I would rather be
eaten alive by a tiger.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.501
Speaking of, I am done waiting
around for Otto to find us.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.333
Let's get the software
and get out of here.

17:30.334 --> 17:32.467
Shh-shh-shh.

17:32.534 --> 17:34.467
I've heard that noise before.

17:34.534 --> 17:37.501
It sounds like...

17:46.567 --> 17:48.634
<i>Your mission,</i>

17:48.701 --> 17:50.967
<i>moron, is to steal
Big Mike's keycard.</i>

17:59.267 --> 18:01.467
See? What'd I tell you?

18:01.534 --> 18:05.668
Sleeping just like Big Mike
after eating a baker's dozen.

18:05.734 --> 18:07.066
Okay, shh.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.967
Shh.
Shh.

18:13.668 --> 18:15.066
Okay, give me the gun.
I'll cover you.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.433
No, no, no, I'll cover you.

18:16.434 --> 18:18.467
You get the collar.
No, trust me.

18:18.534 --> 18:20.366
You have that,
that feline instinct.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.166
I know how to use
a gun better than you do.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.434
See, still don't think
that's a great idea.

18:24.501 --> 18:26.401
Just do it.
Okay, fine.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.134
* *

19:26.668 --> 19:28.601
Oh, my God!

19:31.701 --> 19:33.366
Why didn't you shoot it!

19:33.367 --> 19:34.767
It was about to eat me.

19:34.768 --> 19:36.199
You said he was majestic.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.434
He's a little majestic.

19:38.501 --> 19:40.401
Come on.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.466
Grimes?

19:50.467 --> 19:51.966
I told you

19:51.967 --> 19:53.700
I don't like people looking
at me when I'm asleep.

19:53.701 --> 19:55.601
Mm-hmm. I know, it's just

19:55.668 --> 19:57.466
you had me so worried, I...

19:57.467 --> 19:59.199
For a second there,
I thought you were dead.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.199
What's that in your hand?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.366
This is your keycard.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.033
Yeah, and, uh, I thought
it was cutting off

20:03.034 --> 20:04.899
your air supply, your
air-air pipe. Mm-hmm.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.799
You know and then your esophagi.
And then, I'm looking

20:06.800 --> 20:08.366
and I'm like, there's jelly
all over... Give me that.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.033
Yeah. You can take it,

20:10.034 --> 20:11.866
'cause I was just going to wash
it for you. I'm a grown man.

20:11.867 --> 20:14.167
Yeah, you are.
I can clean up after myself.

20:14.234 --> 20:16.033
Naturally.

20:16.034 --> 20:17.934
But you can get me another one
of those doughnuts.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.933
Thank you for going
to all this trouble.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.334
Babe, I'm your husband.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.733
It's my job to take care
of you, honey.

20:29.734 --> 20:31.933
Still, I feel silly.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.832
You know, there's people
here with real problems.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.366
You get to feel how you feel.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.700
It's a lot to adjust to.

20:36.701 --> 20:39.833
I guess I'm having a hard time
shaking the whole

20:39.900 --> 20:41.333
city girl thing.

20:41.334 --> 20:42.700
I'm sort of...

20:42.701 --> 20:44.033
Out of my element.

20:44.034 --> 20:46.701
I'm not really
an outdoorsy type.

20:47.867 --> 20:49.767
Don't move, babe.

20:50.601 --> 20:52.366
Devon, what are you looking at?

20:52.367 --> 20:54.267
Don't breathe.
Do not...

21:02.768 --> 21:05.000
It's okay.

21:05.067 --> 21:06.400
You're the new guys, right?

21:06.401 --> 21:09.200
The husband and wife team?
Yeah, I'm, uh, Justin.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.300
Camp security coordinator.

21:10.301 --> 21:13.467
Um... you might want
to set up camp

21:13.534 --> 21:15.534
a little further away
from the perimeter.

21:15.601 --> 21:16.566
The animals get a little

21:16.567 --> 21:18.066
curious at night.

21:18.067 --> 21:20.200
You okay, honey?
Oh, yeah.

21:20.267 --> 21:22.099
We're making a difference.
We're making a difference.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.600
Sorry I wasn't around
when you guys arrived.

21:23.601 --> 21:25.033
Outside of your
snake friend here,

21:25.034 --> 21:26.633
we're all very grateful
to have you both here.

21:26.634 --> 21:28.466
Yeah, we need all
the doctors we can find.

21:28.467 --> 21:29.633
Thanks.

21:29.634 --> 21:31.099
Yeah, anytime.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.867
And, uh... welcome to Africa.

21:34.933 --> 21:36.300
Yeah.

21:36.301 --> 21:37.433
We're okay.

21:37.434 --> 21:39.534
We'll be all right.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.567
We're all right.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.367
Okay, here's the
deal: We'll call

21:48.434 --> 21:50.334
the Turners from the road.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.799
Impressive.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.768
You know, I didn't think
they had it in them.

21:56.134 --> 21:57.466
What are you guys doing?

21:57.467 --> 22:00.234
We're teaching you a little
something about spying.

22:00.301 --> 22:01.799
Lesson one:
trust no one...

22:01.800 --> 22:04.067
Except your partner, of course.

22:04.134 --> 22:05.500
We'll take Otto's software.

22:05.501 --> 22:07.768
Wha...? What?! No, no!

22:07.833 --> 22:10.134
You're the Turners!
You can't be

22:10.200 --> 22:11.533
doing this to us.

22:11.534 --> 22:13.300
Don't feel bad, Charles.

22:13.301 --> 22:15.201
We're the best at this.

22:20.834 --> 22:22.532
What do you mean,
they went rogue?

22:22.533 --> 22:24.200
General, Mrs. Turner
pulled a gun on me.

22:24.201 --> 22:26.434
And might I add,
I think she may have

22:26.500 --> 22:28.834
a bit of a problem
with the, uh, sauce.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.699
Uh, the Turners
stole Otto's software.

22:30.700 --> 22:34.434
The Turners are two of the most
decorated spies in the CIA.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.434
There must be some explanation
for their behavior.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.833
I suggest you find it.

22:38.834 --> 22:40.967
Well, I'd be happy
to track them down

22:41.034 --> 22:42.833
if you want to ask
them yourself.

22:42.834 --> 22:44.033
Colonel, you have your mission.

22:44.034 --> 22:45.233
Oh, yeah, how is that

22:45.234 --> 22:46.632
field training
with Morgan going?

22:46.633 --> 22:47.799
Put it this way.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.900
He makes you look
like a natural-born operative.

22:49.967 --> 22:52.267
If you can't make Morgan Grimes
field-ready,

22:52.334 --> 22:55.301
I'm sending you both
to boot camp in Pendleton.

22:55.368 --> 22:57.334
That is all.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.532
Great. This is just great.

23:00.533 --> 23:01.833
This is, this is perfect.

23:01.834 --> 23:03.467
Not only did
the Turners sell us out,

23:03.468 --> 23:05.500
they make us look like complete
amateurs in the process.

23:05.567 --> 23:06.899
Chuck, why are you
doing dishes?

23:06.900 --> 23:08.766
Please? I'm a Bartowski.

23:08.767 --> 23:11.867
This is what we do
to deal with stress. We clean.

23:11.934 --> 23:14.201
Okay, I can see
that you're upset.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.900
<i>I am upset. The Turners were
supposed to be our role models,</i>

23:16.967 --> 23:18.733
and instead, they
turn out to be these

23:18.734 --> 23:20.566
coldhearted
double-crossing traitors.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.066
And now, now you're never
gonna move in with me.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.400
Chuck, we're not the Turners.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.766
Yeah, I know.

23:24.767 --> 23:27.201
But I kind of liked the idea
that we could become them.

23:27.267 --> 23:28.266
Well, right now,

23:28.267 --> 23:29.899
we really need
to focus on finding them.

23:29.900 --> 23:33.401
Sarah, how? The Turners have
been spying for 30 years.

23:33.468 --> 23:35.734
They've got dozens of aliases
and a million different places

23:35.800 --> 23:37.133
they could disappear to.

23:37.134 --> 23:38.733
Whatever beach
they're on right now

23:38.734 --> 23:40.499
I hope that Mr.
Turner's enjoying

23:40.500 --> 23:41.899
his perfect little Manhattan.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.300
The Grand Ambassador.

23:43.301 --> 23:45.166
What?
He said last night

23:45.167 --> 23:47.267
that that was the only place
in Los Angeles

23:47.334 --> 23:49.401
that had the right kind
of cherries.

23:49.468 --> 23:51.233
Hold, hold on a
second. Hold on.

23:51.234 --> 23:52.400
You... you don't
actually think

23:52.401 --> 23:54.000
they're still hanging
around here, do you?

23:54.001 --> 23:57.234
Well, they might if they already
had a buyer for the software.

23:57.301 --> 23:59.767
They picked the wrong couple
to stab in the back.

23:59.834 --> 24:01.800
<i>This is how I deal with stress.</i>

24:04.967 --> 24:06.867
Here we go.

24:11.167 --> 24:12.467
Yes, she's gonna help you.

24:12.468 --> 24:15.468
Can you take care
of this lady? Thank you.

24:21.368 --> 24:23.368
Hey, it's Chuck.
Leave a message.

24:23.434 --> 24:27.567
Hi. Uh, I don't know if you got
any of my other messages, Chuck.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.067
I don't know.
It's just kind of helping me

24:30.134 --> 24:32.034
to talk them out
over the machine.

24:32.067 --> 24:34.633
I can't really talk
to Devon about anything.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.433
He's, like, born to be here.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.833
The villagers love him.

24:37.834 --> 24:39.233
They have this nickname for him.

24:39.234 --> 24:40.866
We can't really pronounce it
in Bantu,

24:40.867 --> 24:42.066
but it loosely translates

24:42.067 --> 24:44.667
to "Dr. Super Fantastic
White Person."

24:44.734 --> 24:47.567
I'm just tired.

24:47.633 --> 24:49.567
I'm just tired,
and I'll feel better

24:49.633 --> 24:50.966
when I get some sleep.

24:50.967 --> 24:54.334
Okay, I love you and I miss you.

24:54.401 --> 24:56.700
I'll talk to you soon.

24:58.401 --> 24:59.966
Ellie.
Yeah?

24:59.967 --> 25:01.266
How are you?

25:01.267 --> 25:03.633
Great. You know, if
you ever need to talk,

25:03.700 --> 25:04.733
you can always come to me.

25:04.734 --> 25:05.799
It's just one of my jobs.

25:05.800 --> 25:09.334
I'm fine. I'm fine.

25:09.401 --> 25:10.899
Good.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.834
Mm, I'm not fine.

25:12.900 --> 25:16.134
Huh. I-I have
a little brother,

25:16.201 --> 25:19.067
and, uh, we used to camp out
in our backyard.

25:19.134 --> 25:20.833
I would, I would pitch a tent

25:20.834 --> 25:22.133
and make s'mores,
the whole thing.

25:22.134 --> 25:23.400
He'd fall asleep,

25:23.401 --> 25:25.266
and I'd sneak back inside
and set the alarm

25:25.267 --> 25:27.867
for the morning and get in there
before he could wake up.

25:27.934 --> 25:32.434
I just... Justin,
I'm not built for this.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.699
That's not true.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.333
I've seen you
with your patients, Ellie.

25:35.334 --> 25:38.334
<i>You are built for
being a doctor here.</i>

25:38.401 --> 25:41.967
Now, it might take time to get
used to the other stuff, but...

25:42.034 --> 25:43.934
It's worth it.

25:48.900 --> 25:51.667
Thank you, Justin.

25:51.734 --> 25:53.532
Welcome.

25:53.533 --> 25:55.934
<i>Mmm!</i>

25:56.001 --> 25:57.766
I can get used to this.

25:57.767 --> 25:59.333
You will, darling,

25:59.334 --> 26:02.267
as soon as we make the sale.

26:02.334 --> 26:05.167
30 years, we always
did what's right.

26:05.234 --> 26:07.767
I keep thinking of those
poor, young agents.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.632
What a pair of saps.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.433
Reminded me of us.

26:11.434 --> 26:13.867
I just hope we didn't
hurt their career.

26:13.934 --> 26:16.368
They never had a career,
not with the CIA.

26:16.434 --> 26:18.834
You saw how they looked
at each other.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.201
They're obviously in love.

26:21.267 --> 26:23.201
And we're not?

26:23.267 --> 26:25.468
Oh, no, no, we're still in love.

26:25.533 --> 26:28.034
<i>A different sort
of love.</i>

26:28.101 --> 26:31.001
It's just more like a...
an old bourbon.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.600
So now I'm old?
Aged to perfection, my dear.

26:33.667 --> 26:36.134
How about that little piece
of jailbait at the party?

26:36.201 --> 26:38.234
Was that you trying to
cork a younger vintage?

26:38.301 --> 26:40.234
I see where you're going
with the metaphor.

26:40.301 --> 26:42.967
No, she was just part
of the mission; a diversion.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.734
How many times have I heard that
excuse, you lecherous old...?!

26:45.800 --> 26:47.900
She was planning on having breast
enhancement surgery, and she asked my advice.

26:47.967 --> 26:49.532
You'd like to give her
an operation, wouldn't you?

26:49.533 --> 26:51.934
She was obviously in awe of me,
if not in love.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.101
Room service!

26:54.167 --> 26:56.700
Go ahead and leave it.

27:03.034 --> 27:04.934
All clear.

27:10.334 --> 27:13.067
"Compliments
of the Bartowski's."

27:13.134 --> 27:15.368
Darling, do we know
any Bartowski...?

27:19.667 --> 27:22.134
How did you ever find us?

27:22.201 --> 27:24.600
You're the only room
that ordered 12 Manhattans.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.900
We learned from the best.

27:26.967 --> 27:29.900
You don't know what
that weapon is, do you?

27:29.967 --> 27:31.599
What? Are you kidding me?

27:31.600 --> 27:34.867
Sig 229 nine millimeter,
13-round magazine.

27:34.934 --> 27:36.666
Laser grip,
full metal jacket, sir.

27:36.667 --> 27:38.867
Impressive.

27:38.934 --> 27:40.766
Yeah, well, I play a lot
of first-person shooters.

27:40.767 --> 27:43.067
Well, this isn't a video game.

27:43.134 --> 27:45.267
Hey, whoa-whoa.

27:45.334 --> 27:47.234
Thank you.

27:47.267 --> 27:48.599
All right.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.767
Here we go. No problem.

27:50.834 --> 27:51.966
Morgan, you got this.

27:51.967 --> 27:53.133
<i>Just like Call of Duty.</i>

27:53.134 --> 27:55.468
Squeeze the trigger...

27:55.533 --> 27:57.533
Oh!

27:57.600 --> 27:59.367
Holy cow!
I think your gun

27:59.368 --> 28:00.766
just exploded in my hand!

28:00.767 --> 28:02.532
Sit down! There's nothing wrong
with the gun.

28:02.533 --> 28:04.200
Hmm?
Sit down!

28:04.201 --> 28:06.734
No, I-I think should...
Sit!

28:06.800 --> 28:08.700
Yes, sir.

28:10.633 --> 28:12.734
You're firing me, aren't you?

28:12.800 --> 28:14.233
Oh, my God, this is even

28:14.234 --> 28:16.234
worse than when I got canned
from Underpants, Etc.

28:16.301 --> 28:18.900
It's not the end of the world.

28:18.967 --> 28:21.401
Oh, come on! That's what you all
say when you fire me.

28:21.468 --> 28:22.499
I blew it.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.434
I blew my one chance
to be a spy,

28:24.500 --> 28:25.833
and the thing is, Casey,

28:25.834 --> 28:27.699
all I wanted to do
was be a part of this team.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.934
Know how you feel.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.766
You know, Morgan,
you were there for me

28:32.767 --> 28:34.467
when I was out on my ass
with the agency.

28:34.468 --> 28:37.934
I just want you to know
I'm here for you now.

28:38.001 --> 28:39.901
Really?

28:41.101 --> 28:43.667
Not just like spy or work
or Buy More,

28:43.734 --> 28:45.634
you mean like a friend.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.834
Let's just keep that
on the down low, huh?

28:49.835 --> 28:52.101
Done. Shh. But I need
you to know something.

28:52.167 --> 28:54.067
I've been canned
from a lot of places.

28:54.068 --> 28:57.034
By a lot of people,
and... you were the best, sir.

28:59.034 --> 29:00.733
Whew!

29:00.734 --> 29:04.001
Let's not let ourselves
get carried away here, Charles.

29:04.067 --> 29:05.499
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Turner.

29:05.500 --> 29:06.933
Is that what you think,

29:06.934 --> 29:08.566
that I'm getting carried away?
How did you think

29:08.567 --> 29:10.500
we would react
after what you did?

29:10.567 --> 29:12.667
What have we really done
at this point, Sarah?

29:12.734 --> 29:14.934
We didn't sell Otto's software,

29:15.001 --> 29:16.666
so technically,
we're not yet traitors.

29:16.667 --> 29:17.666
Am I correct?

29:17.667 --> 29:19.333
It was his idea to steal it.

29:19.334 --> 29:21.834
He forced me to act
like a drunk at the party.

29:21.900 --> 29:24.667
I only wish his lecherous
Lothario routine was an act.

29:24.734 --> 29:27.301
She's lying! I wanted
to bring the software back.

29:27.368 --> 29:29.567
It was her idea to sell it
on the black market.

29:29.633 --> 29:31.367
Oh, no, no,
you can't lie to the...

29:31.368 --> 29:32.632
You can lie to me.

29:32.633 --> 29:34.100
Your duplicity amazes me.

29:34.101 --> 29:35.899
Quiet!

29:35.900 --> 29:38.468
Enough, okay?

29:38.533 --> 29:40.468
It is one thing to
betray your agency,

29:40.533 --> 29:42.533
it is another to
betray your partner.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
You were supposed

29:44.667 --> 29:46.400
to come here and teach us.

29:46.401 --> 29:48.533
Teach us how to be
a great spy couple.

29:51.201 --> 29:55.201
You really think we're that bad?

29:55.267 --> 29:57.368
Only because you were
once great, yeah.

29:58.667 --> 30:00.166
<i>We were great,</i>

30:00.167 --> 30:02.767
remember?

30:02.834 --> 30:04.767
Check back with me
in 30 years, Charles.

30:06.468 --> 30:08.900
The CIA has a way
of breaking young idealists.

30:08.967 --> 30:11.267
Especially if they're in love.

30:16.633 --> 30:19.434
Good, the marshals are here.

30:24.167 --> 30:26.067
It's Otto!

30:32.101 --> 30:34.633
And his pussycat.

30:44.234 --> 30:47.033
How, how did your good friend
Otto find us?

30:47.100 --> 30:49.734
Did you two sell us out again?

30:49.801 --> 30:52.167
The collar has
a tracking device.

30:52.234 --> 30:54.434
All right, where do you keep
your backup guns?

30:54.501 --> 30:56.032
Surely, you've heard

30:56.033 --> 30:58.067
of the 30-foot rule, Charles.

31:01.134 --> 31:03.067
Time to flash, time to flash.

31:04.401 --> 31:07.200
No guns, no flash.

31:07.267 --> 31:09.701
Honey, darling, would you mind
telling me what you've done

31:09.768 --> 31:12.868
with our small cache of weapons?
I got rid of them, sweetheart.

31:12.933 --> 31:14.967
You actually listened to me? I
can't quite believe it myself.

31:15.033 --> 31:17.467
What have you done with the gun that you
had at the hotel? I left them in the car.

31:17.534 --> 31:19.601
Why would you...?
Because you told me to!

31:19.667 --> 31:21.567
Rookies. You take care of them

31:21.601 --> 31:23.501
I'll take care of Otto.

31:26.167 --> 31:28.234
You're making a big mistake.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.267
Hi, how you doing?

31:30.334 --> 31:32.234
Good Lord!

31:34.501 --> 31:36.467
Sorry to drop in on you
like this.

31:38.367 --> 31:41.134
Sasha always feels at home
wherever she goes.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.267
You don't mind
if she looks around?

31:43.334 --> 31:46.467
What, uh,
what-what-what's going on?

31:46.534 --> 31:48.400
Uh, who are you people?

31:48.401 --> 31:50.199
You know exactly who I am.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.100
The question is, who are you?

31:52.134 --> 31:55.167
Wait a minute. You're the guy!

31:55.234 --> 31:58.033
Baby, this is the guy with
the mansion up in the hills!

31:58.100 --> 32:00.000
Oh, oh, I told you
this would happen.

32:00.033 --> 32:02.501
I'm so sorry. My boyfriend
thinks that it's really funny

32:02.567 --> 32:04.400
to crash rich people's parties.

32:04.401 --> 32:05.966
Where are the two

32:05.967 --> 32:07.533
CIA agents you're hiding?

32:07.534 --> 32:08.633
I'm sorry. What?

32:08.634 --> 32:10.032
I believe you know them

32:10.033 --> 32:11.533
as Mr. and Mrs. Turner.

32:11.534 --> 32:14.267
I'm a, I'm a little
confused here.

32:14.334 --> 32:16.601
Why would CIA agents be
in our apartment?

32:16.667 --> 32:18.601
Because this isn't
a real apartment.

32:18.667 --> 32:20.868
This is a CIA safe house.

32:20.933 --> 32:24.667
And you two
are not a real couple.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.099
You are spies.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.501
Ah!

32:28.567 --> 32:30.634
I'm on to you.

32:30.701 --> 32:31.700
This is a practical joke,
isn't it?

32:31.701 --> 32:32.700
I bet this is from your brother.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.366
Okay, oh...

32:34.367 --> 32:35.767
You're a spy, honey.
We're spies.

32:35.768 --> 32:37.233
Scary spies.
You know what?

32:37.234 --> 32:38.932
I've always felt like
I've got a James Bond-y thing

32:38.933 --> 32:40.833
going on about me.
You do. You could be,

32:40.868 --> 32:42.099
like, uh, Octopussy
or something like that.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.133
Oh, yeah.

32:43.134 --> 32:44.266
Now you're being
really insulting.

32:44.267 --> 32:46.834
Listen, whoever you are,

32:46.900 --> 32:49.334
all I ask is

32:49.401 --> 32:51.299
that you hand over the Turners.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.334
You have until the count

32:53.401 --> 32:54.600
<i>of drei.</i>

32:54.601 --> 32:57.334
<i>Eins, zwei...</i>

32:57.401 --> 33:00.033
Stop. Please stop
with the countdown.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.667
Ah, if I could just have a brief
sidebar with my girlfriend,

33:02.734 --> 33:04.634
that would be great.

33:05.401 --> 33:06.932
Good. Thanks.

33:06.933 --> 33:10.501
These guys really
take it seriously.

33:10.567 --> 33:12.734
This is very good,
though. Very real.

33:12.801 --> 33:14.299
I say we hand them
over. We can't do that.

33:14.300 --> 33:15.633
Why not? They
sold us out.

33:15.634 --> 33:17.299
Because then we'd be
no better than the Turners.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.966
Well, maybe they're right.
Maybe we're going to

33:18.967 --> 33:20.633
end up just like them-
a couple of traitors.

33:20.634 --> 33:22.534
Do you really believe that?

33:26.501 --> 33:28.467
No.

33:31.967 --> 33:33.933
I'm sorry, sir. Uh,
but I-I really...

33:34.000 --> 33:35.933
I don't, I don't think
we can help you.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.900
I'm sorry to hear that.

33:40.267 --> 33:42.032
Guard them.

33:42.033 --> 33:43.099
Uh, yeah, I don't think

33:43.100 --> 33:46.801
that kitty litter
box is big enough.

33:46.868 --> 33:48.433
Good girl, Sasha.

33:48.434 --> 33:50.334
Take her outside.

33:59.134 --> 34:01.034
Sure you're all right?
Yeah.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.800
Espionage wasn't
my only aspiration.

34:02.801 --> 34:04.500
I mean, I could always join
the competitive eating circuit.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.634
Well, dare to dream.

34:15.134 --> 34:16.565
<i>The Turners are very clever.</i>

34:16.567 --> 34:18.299
It appears your guests
left in a hurry.

34:18.300 --> 34:20.065
This is unbelievable.

34:20.067 --> 34:22.300
The Turners have left us
holding the bag again?

34:22.367 --> 34:25.333
I can assure you,
this will be the last time.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Otto.

34:26.734 --> 34:28.366
Hold on a second.
Clearly,

34:28.367 --> 34:30.367
The Turners have betrayed us
both; that means that we're all

34:30.434 --> 34:32.266
on the same side here,
so put your guns down

34:32.266 --> 34:35.033
and let us help you hunt down
those backstabbing bastards.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.199
They're the lowest
of the low, okay?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.299
CIA scum.

34:37.300 --> 34:40.333
Let them go, Otto.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.367
But they're not
without their moments.

34:43.434 --> 34:45.900
What the hell is this?

34:49.266 --> 34:52.167
Wh-What is it,
Casey? What?

34:52.234 --> 34:54.032
Shh!

34:54.033 --> 34:55.565
It's a Bengal tiger.

34:55.567 --> 34:56.931
Female.

34:56.933 --> 34:58.834
Fully grown.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.800
Avoid eye contact.

35:00.801 --> 35:03.534
If she charges,

35:03.601 --> 35:05.366
make yourself
as big as possible.

35:05.367 --> 35:06.800
Easy for you to say.

35:06.801 --> 35:08.466
It's us you want.

35:08.467 --> 35:09.666
We've got the software.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.567
What are you two doing?

35:11.601 --> 35:13.601
Showing you we're not traitors,
Charles.

35:13.667 --> 35:15.701
What should we do?

35:15.768 --> 35:17.566
Shh! You're gonna
get us killed.

35:17.567 --> 35:19.467
No.

35:22.334 --> 35:24.801
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Just hear me out. Hear me out.

35:24.868 --> 35:26.666
This country needs men
like you, Casey.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.100
Okay? What do I do?

35:29.167 --> 35:31.467
I sell refrigerators, you know?
I mean, if I die, what?

35:31.534 --> 35:32.800
They'll shop at Large Mart.
Big deal.

35:32.801 --> 35:35.267
But there is a way I
can serve my country.

35:35.334 --> 35:39.100
What are you doing? I'm luring the
tiger into Ellie and Awesome's apartment.

35:39.167 --> 35:41.267
You're not. Yes, I am,
and listen to me. No matter

35:41.334 --> 35:43.032
what you hear in there,
promise me you will not

35:43.033 --> 35:44.133
go in there after me.

35:44.134 --> 35:46.234
Semper fi-dizzle.

35:49.667 --> 35:51.567
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.

35:56.834 --> 35:58.734
Sasha.

36:21.567 --> 36:24.601
Oh! Okay.

36:24.667 --> 36:26.868
Did you see that? Told you
I was good for something.

36:26.933 --> 36:28.833
Yeah. Move.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.933
We have to bring you in.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.867
You know I can't let you go.

36:33.868 --> 36:35.099
That's funny.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.899
I would have said
the same thing 30 years ago.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.032
After what we did?

36:38.033 --> 36:39.967
You would have shot us dead
where we stand.

36:40.033 --> 36:42.501
Which would be perfectly
justifiable.

36:47.434 --> 36:48.800
And yet unnecessary.

36:48.801 --> 36:50.533
Wouldn't you agree, Sarah?

36:50.534 --> 36:53.000
They did save us.

36:57.367 --> 36:59.967
Sorry, darling.

37:00.033 --> 37:03.534
It's over.

37:17.434 --> 37:18.766
Good work, Team.

37:18.767 --> 37:20.834
Our cryptographers
are analyzing Otto's software

37:20.900 --> 37:22.233
as we speak.

37:22.234 --> 37:24.100
Thanks to you, our nation's

37:24.101 --> 37:26.368
communications network
remains secure.

37:26.434 --> 37:27.599
Thank you, General.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.599
And now,

37:28.600 --> 37:30.700
on to the subject
of the Turners

37:30.767 --> 37:32.433
and their actions.

37:32.434 --> 37:34.066
Actually, General, if I might
be able to say something

37:34.067 --> 37:35.100
on behalf of the Turners...

37:35.101 --> 37:37.001
General.
No, Sarah. I think I...

37:37.034 --> 37:39.301
No, Chuck. It's
okay. I got it.

37:39.368 --> 37:41.567
The Turner's double-cross was
actually a triple-cross.

37:41.633 --> 37:43.532
By stealing the software
from us,

37:43.533 --> 37:45.367
they were able to
lure Otto into a trap,

37:45.368 --> 37:46.532
and we were able
to capture him.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.767
It was a daring
bit of spycraft.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.734
I would expect nothing
less from the Turners.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.734
I just hope you
and Agent Bartowski

37:53.800 --> 37:55.400
were able to learn something

37:55.401 --> 37:56.733
from these
two exemplary operatives.

37:56.734 --> 37:59.001
As a matter of fact, General,

37:59.067 --> 38:00.233
yes, working with the Turners

38:00.234 --> 38:04.267
was... quite humbling.

38:04.334 --> 38:06.633
You must be ready to move on
to your next assignment.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.934
Thanks but no thanks, General.

38:09.001 --> 38:10.467
E- Excuse me?

38:10.468 --> 38:12.367
No more assignments.

38:12.368 --> 38:14.800
What my husband means to say

38:14.867 --> 38:16.632
is, we're retiring.

38:16.633 --> 38:18.800
But you can't just walk away.

38:18.867 --> 38:19.933
You are the best of the best.

38:19.934 --> 38:23.167
Who will possibly
take your place?

38:25.633 --> 38:27.033
You...

38:27.034 --> 38:28.666
Are you sure? Really?

38:28.667 --> 38:30.834
I mean, thank you.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.001
* *

38:33.067 --> 38:36.001
Watch each other's
backs, you two.

38:36.067 --> 38:38.667
And I wish you
many happy marriages.

38:48.201 --> 38:50.201
* *

39:15.633 --> 39:16.666
Please tell me that
Chuck is joking

39:16.667 --> 39:18.066
about them sending
me to boot camp.

39:18.067 --> 39:19.233
'Cause, oh, man.

39:19.234 --> 39:20.433
They're gonna make
me shave my beard.

39:20.434 --> 39:21.566
Hmm. Relax.

39:21.567 --> 39:22.666
You passed.

39:22.667 --> 39:24.467
Huh?
I failed every test.

39:24.468 --> 39:25.966
With flying colors.

39:25.967 --> 39:28.468
You have got to be
hands down, bar none

39:28.533 --> 39:30.333
the worst candidate
I've ever trained.

39:30.334 --> 39:33.368
But you've got one thing
going for you.

39:33.434 --> 39:35.100
You got balls.

39:35.101 --> 39:37.334
I do?

39:37.401 --> 39:38.966
How many Marines
you know would go

39:38.967 --> 39:40.867
up against a Bengal
tiger unarmed? Yeah.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.733
You'd have to be
a complete idiot.

39:42.734 --> 39:43.933
Well, that's the thing.
You know...

39:43.934 --> 39:46.434
That's, that's me
in a nutshell.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.867
Lesser men, they'd run away
from danger, and I'm, uh..

39:52.001 --> 39:53.901
Casey?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.233
Dude.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.134
You turned my
sister's apartment

40:04.201 --> 40:06.234
into a kitty litter box.

40:06.301 --> 40:07.599
I know.
I'm sorry, man.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.799
I just... How was
I supposed to know

40:08.800 --> 40:10.700
the tiger wasn't housebroken?

40:12.767 --> 40:13.933
Oh, my God.

40:13.934 --> 40:15.133
Great. You're here.

40:15.134 --> 40:16.467
Guys, we got to get
this place fixed up

40:16.468 --> 40:17.766
before Devon
and Ellie get back.

40:17.767 --> 40:19.066
Well, actually,

40:19.067 --> 40:20.967
<i>I was gonna start
with our place.</i>

40:23.468 --> 40:24.899
<i>Our place?</i>

40:24.900 --> 40:29.167
That is, if your offer for
me to move in still stands?

40:29.234 --> 40:31.134
Yeah.

40:33.301 --> 40:34.532
I'm sorry that I freaked out

40:34.533 --> 40:35.833
when you asked me
to move in with you.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.867
It's just, you know
how I grew up.

40:38.934 --> 40:40.900
I spent my life living in
hotel rooms under fake names.

40:40.967 --> 40:42.766
I've been trained to survive

40:42.767 --> 40:44.333
a thousand different
situations in the field,

40:44.334 --> 40:47.600
but nobody ever taught me
how to have a normal life.

40:47.667 --> 40:50.368
Well, I hate to break it
to you, but I don't think

40:50.434 --> 40:52.500
we're ever going
to live a normal life.

40:52.567 --> 40:55.267
Well, I'd like to have
something to fall back on

40:55.334 --> 40:57.633
when our spy life is over.

41:04.434 --> 41:06.600
Devon, sweetie, where are you?

41:09.567 --> 41:11.468
Devon?

41:11.533 --> 41:13.433
Baby?

41:14.267 --> 41:16.267
Ah, baby, you're burning up.

41:16.334 --> 41:18.533
I'll be right back.
Help!

41:23.533 --> 41:24.799
Sorry, El.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.666
I thought we could do
some good work here.

41:26.667 --> 41:27.833
You do not apologize.

41:27.834 --> 41:29.734
Now it's my job
to take care of you, okay?

41:32.867 --> 41:33.866
Thank you.

41:33.867 --> 41:35.233
I alerted the airport.

41:35.234 --> 41:36.566
There's an ambulance
waiting for you,

41:36.567 --> 41:38.300
so you can skip customs
and drive straight

41:38.301 --> 41:40.100
onto the tarmac.
Thank you.

41:40.101 --> 41:41.733
