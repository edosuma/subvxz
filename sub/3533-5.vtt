00:14.233 --> 00:15.832
How'd you find me, son?

00:16.067 --> 00:17.500
Oh, I have my resources.

00:19.968 --> 00:21.333
That your car?

00:21.367 --> 00:24.834
This old thing?
You bet your ass.

00:24.868 --> 00:26.467
I paid cash
for the motherfucker.

00:26.501 --> 00:29.568
Bought it with an advance
that I was paid for this,

00:29.602 --> 00:31.768
uh, self-help novel I'm about
to have published

00:31.803 --> 00:33.535
onto the Oprah's book clubs.

00:33.570 --> 00:34.769
So you're rich, huh?

00:34.803 --> 00:35.802
Oh, yeah.

00:35.837 --> 00:37.569
I pretty much saved
all my pennies

00:37.603 --> 00:38.736
from my major league days.

00:38.770 --> 00:41.136
Invested a lot of it
very wisely

00:41.170 --> 00:44.404
in stocks, bonds,
famous works of arts.

00:44.438 --> 00:46.038
You rich too?

00:46.072 --> 00:47.405
I'm rich enough.

00:47.439 --> 00:49.372
Why do you think I'm digging
this goddamn hole?

00:49.407 --> 00:51.840
I don't know. Maybe to bury
your shit like a cat. Ha.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.007
Think again.

00:53.042 --> 00:54.474
I got so much income,

00:54.508 --> 00:56.541
I'm having to hid all the shit
outside the house.

00:56.576 --> 01:00.176
Got holes like this
all over my grounds.

01:00.210 --> 01:02.143
I'm the only one
knows where they're at.

01:02.178 --> 01:04.611
Well, we know
where that one's at.

01:04.646 --> 01:06.112
Wrong a second time.

01:06.146 --> 01:07.813
This is a fake hole.

01:07.847 --> 01:10.180
I started digging this one
when I saw you pull up.

01:10.214 --> 01:11.881
You should put your money
in the bank,

01:11.915 --> 01:15.215
because somebody could come
in here with a metal detector

01:15.250 --> 01:17.183
or something and...
Who's the poon?

01:17.217 --> 01:18.650
He's my assistant.

01:18.685 --> 01:19.617
He's a poon.

01:19.652 --> 01:21.052
A poon or not,

01:21.086 --> 01:23.186
looks like only one of us
has an assistant.

01:23.220 --> 01:24.520
Unless of course yours is buried

01:24.554 --> 01:26.287
in one of these
fucking gopher holes.

01:26.321 --> 01:29.022
His dead assistant.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.890
Same old Kenny.
Ten pounds of shit

01:30.924 --> 01:32.858
in a 5-pound bag.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.358
And friends with faggots.

01:40.763 --> 01:44.932
Well, first off on the tour,
I'll show you my barn.

01:44.966 --> 01:46.533
That's where I do my inventing.

01:46.567 --> 01:50.736
I used to grow enough crops
to completely sustain myself.

01:50.771 --> 01:53.138
But after mastering the art
of agriculture,

01:53.173 --> 01:57.342
I've grown bored with it.
Hence its neglect.

01:57.376 --> 02:00.177
This is my
getting-around-town ride.

02:00.212 --> 02:03.479
A little beat up
but still a classic.

02:03.513 --> 02:05.880
Yeah, my getting-around-town
ride is a Lambo,

02:05.914 --> 02:07.379
but you already knew that.

02:07.413 --> 02:09.312
Well, I can't compete
with you on a car level.

02:09.347 --> 02:10.613
That's true.

02:10.648 --> 02:12.347
I've never been much
for the open road.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.615
Heh-heh. Of course.

02:13.649 --> 02:16.383
That's why I have a plane
and also a boat.

02:16.417 --> 02:17.918
You have wings and a ship?

02:17.952 --> 02:20.352
They're in remote storage
next to my grottos.

02:20.386 --> 02:22.220
Goddamn, that's impressive.

02:22.254 --> 02:25.322
Now keep in mind
this is just our summer home.

02:25.356 --> 02:28.391
Uh, sorry, house rules.
No butt-huggers.

02:28.425 --> 02:31.961
This is my father's estate.
We do have to obey his policies.

02:31.995 --> 02:33.629
Why don't you keep an eye
on the whip?

02:33.663 --> 02:37.165
Make sure none of the villagers
try to fuck with it.

02:45.903 --> 02:47.836
Okay, honey puss, take a break.

02:47.870 --> 02:49.770
Somebody I want you to meet.

02:49.804 --> 02:51.470
This is Soledad, my wife.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.271
She keeps me on time

02:53.305 --> 02:55.205
and I keep her moist
in her underpants.

02:57.041 --> 03:00.575
Uh, this is, uh, Kenneth
a stranger I met in town.

03:00.610 --> 03:04.545
He's rolling through Mexico
with the Harlem Globetrotters.

03:04.579 --> 03:06.914
Oh, well, nice to meet you.

03:06.948 --> 03:08.381
Are you staying
for dinner then?

03:08.416 --> 03:10.183
I'm not really sure
why he's lying about me

03:10.217 --> 03:12.151
being a worker for
the Harlem Globetrotters.

03:12.186 --> 03:14.620
That's not what I am.
I'm his son.

03:16.055 --> 03:18.090
I'm just dicking with you,
Kenny.

03:18.124 --> 03:21.026
Yeah, he's my, uh, kid
from, uh, up in the States.

03:21.061 --> 03:22.661
I'm a professional
baseball player.

03:22.696 --> 03:23.929
You probably have heard of me.

03:23.963 --> 03:25.630
Oh, wow.

03:25.665 --> 03:28.266
You're a baseball player, huh?

03:28.301 --> 03:30.769
<i>A famous baseball player
in the familia.</i>

03:31.971 --> 03:33.438
I had no idea.

03:33.472 --> 03:35.907
So we're not much for bragging,
are we, Eduardo?

03:35.941 --> 03:38.310
Oh, no, Eduardo doesn't like
to talk about his past.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.345
Yeah, obviously
he doesn't like using

03:40.379 --> 03:41.713
his real name either.

03:41.747 --> 03:43.681
Well, you know how it is.

03:43.716 --> 03:45.450
You start pulling
on a little thread

03:45.484 --> 03:48.453
and the next thing you know you
just fucked up the entire shirt.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.058
Who's this nerd?

03:53.092 --> 03:54.826
Oh, Casper.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:03.301 --> 04:04.635
What's up?

04:06.673 --> 04:09.143
Casper don't talk much.

04:09.177 --> 04:10.745
That's cool.

04:10.779 --> 04:14.080
Honestly, I feel like most teens
these days talk too much anyway.

04:14.115 --> 04:17.017
Yeah, well,
that one's your brother.

04:17.051 --> 04:18.885
He's my what?

04:23.324 --> 04:24.624
You're fucking kidding, right?

04:24.658 --> 04:27.827
Yeah, y'all both came out
of this old man's jizz.

04:35.264 --> 04:38.833
<i>Yo say. Yo say, Maria.</i>

04:38.867 --> 04:40.067
Oh shit, shit, shit.

04:40.102 --> 04:41.468
Oh...

04:42.704 --> 04:44.671
Hey, how's the bonding going,
big guy?

04:44.706 --> 04:46.173
Oh, it's still going on.

04:46.207 --> 04:48.541
I'm just gonna come out here
for a timeout.

04:48.575 --> 04:49.942
Turns out I got
a goddamn stepmom

04:49.977 --> 04:51.610
and a fucking Navajo
half brother.

04:51.645 --> 04:53.278
Do you want me to come in there

04:53.313 --> 04:55.380
and maybe mediate for you,
or I could help out in...

04:55.414 --> 04:57.549
No, I don't... I don't see how
that would be helpful.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.550
I think I would like you
just to post up out here.

04:59.585 --> 05:01.485
Just to post up? Okay.
Yeah.

05:01.519 --> 05:03.920
Why are you acting weird?
What do you have in your pocket?

05:03.955 --> 05:06.055
Uh, in my pockets?
Other pocket.

05:06.090 --> 05:07.790
What do you keep fucking
hiding from me?

05:07.825 --> 05:10.326
Just my phone.
Um, I was just calling...

05:10.360 --> 05:11.360
Maria?
No!

05:11.394 --> 05:12.361
What a bitch, dude.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.829
You're out here talking
to Maria?

05:13.863 --> 05:15.630
I'm just talking to my mom.
Fuck your mom.

05:15.665 --> 05:18.099
Keep the lines clear. I need
your full concentration here.

05:18.133 --> 05:20.167
This is the most important
moment of my life.

05:20.201 --> 05:21.535
Got you.
Yeah, Stevie?

05:21.569 --> 05:22.669
I have a question.

05:22.704 --> 05:25.338
Um, are we going to be
staying here for dinner,

05:25.372 --> 05:27.607
or are we going to be
going back for dinner?

05:27.641 --> 05:29.742
Stevie, please don't make me
put a damn time limit

05:29.776 --> 05:31.510
on all this
emotional discovery.

05:31.544 --> 05:33.945
Okay, I am sorry
that your brother is Navajo.

05:33.980 --> 05:36.081
Me too. I know that would
be very upsetting.

05:36.115 --> 05:38.783
If I found out
I had a half-black brother

05:38.818 --> 05:41.052
or a whole-black brother,
I would be very upset.

05:41.086 --> 05:43.354
Ah. Okay, I'm going back
in right now.

05:43.388 --> 05:44.755
Okay.

05:45.790 --> 05:48.391
Good luck.
Be quiet. Thank you.

05:58.766 --> 06:00.566
Where'd everybody go?

06:00.601 --> 06:02.335
Don't know.

06:02.369 --> 06:04.437
They just left you
in here alone,

06:04.471 --> 06:07.475
doing some arts and crafts
and shit?

06:07.509 --> 06:09.343
What are you making,
a piÃ±ata penis pump?

06:09.377 --> 06:12.946
I'm just making some shit for my
fucking house party next week.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.447
Oh, you like to party?

06:14.482 --> 06:15.915
It's a birthday party.

06:15.950 --> 06:18.050
A birthday party?
How old are you gonna be?

06:18.084 --> 06:19.385
Fifteen.

06:20.620 --> 06:22.687
You and your stupid
fucking hat.

06:22.721 --> 06:25.122
Sitting here getting
your goddamn hooks in Pop.

06:25.156 --> 06:27.090
Honestly, I can't say
I blame you.

06:27.124 --> 06:29.324
Seems like you've had things
pretty good here,

06:29.359 --> 06:33.327
flying on planes, fixing up
old cars, eating veggies,

06:33.361 --> 06:34.895
sucking down Goya beans.

06:34.929 --> 06:37.463
Heh. Basically living
the dream life, huh?

06:37.497 --> 06:42.101
Well, unfortunately for you,
all that shit ends today.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.805
Casper, I'm not
letting anything

06:45.840 --> 06:47.674
stand in the way of me
bonding with that man,

06:47.708 --> 06:50.243
do you understand me?
You want to come to my party?

06:50.278 --> 06:52.679
I don't give a shit
about your party, all right?

06:53.982 --> 06:55.415
You cocky-ass motherfucker.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.150
You think you're
gonna win, huh?

06:57.184 --> 06:59.151
This isn't over with me
and you, dude.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.887
I'm gonna fuck you up.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.424
Well, there you are.
My two boys.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.325
I'm just feeling
kind of oddly energetic

07:07.360 --> 07:08.827
just looking at the two of you.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.562
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.497
Almost like you never
abandoned me at all

07:12.531 --> 07:14.265
and I've always been
part of your family.

07:14.299 --> 07:15.299
Good.

07:15.334 --> 07:17.401
Kenny, isn't it about time

07:17.435 --> 07:19.703
you saw how the old man
plies his trade?

07:19.738 --> 07:20.805
I'd love too.

07:20.839 --> 07:23.374
Let's go.

07:23.408 --> 07:26.744
And how are all
you fine people today?

07:26.778 --> 07:28.813
- Great.
- Awesome.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.915
Everybody ready
to have some fun?

07:30.949 --> 07:32.549
Yeah!
I know she is.

07:33.951 --> 07:36.585
All right, strap in. Put your
helmets on, little ladies.

07:36.620 --> 07:40.288
I know these helmets make you
look like a puss, but trust me,

07:40.322 --> 07:42.723
you do not want to rely
on these quacks down here

07:42.758 --> 07:45.759
in these hospitals to put Humpty
Dumpty back together again.

07:45.794 --> 07:50.063
All right, let's saddle up
and blaze these ponies.

07:50.097 --> 07:52.364
I'm about to show you
all the beauty

07:52.399 --> 07:55.600
of unspoiled nature
that is Mexico.

07:57.169 --> 07:59.436
<i>âª Let's go everywhere, man âª</i>

07:59.471 --> 08:02.538
<i>âª Let's go everywhere, man âª</i>

08:02.572 --> 08:05.373
<i>âª Get out of your chair, man âª</i>

08:05.408 --> 08:08.275
<i>âª Let's go everywhere âª</i>

08:08.310 --> 08:10.310
<i>âª We'll go to Bombay
Taipei, Mandalay âª</i>

08:10.345 --> 08:13.047
<i>âª Bora-Bora, Deauville
Louisville, Whoville âª</i>

08:13.081 --> 08:15.849
<i>âª Glocca Morra, Havana
Montana, Savannah âª</i>

08:15.884 --> 08:19.853
<i>âª Varanasi, Bermuda, Barbuda
Or Yehuda, Tallahassee âª</i>

08:19.887 --> 08:22.121
<i>âª Khartoum, Rangoon

08:22.155 --> 08:25.457
<i>âª Kowloon, Cameroon, Brigadn

08:25.492 --> 08:27.726
<i>âª Let's go everywhere, man âª</i>

08:27.760 --> 08:30.831
<i>âª Let's go everywhere, man âª</i>

08:30.865 --> 08:33.301
<i>âª There's lots of fun
Out there, man âª</i>

08:33.335 --> 08:36.070
<i>âª We got to have
Our share, man âª</i>

08:39.273 --> 08:41.241
Well, all right.

08:41.275 --> 08:43.909
We'll stop here
for a little siesta.

08:43.943 --> 08:47.779
You can take in the scenery or,
uh, go for a swim if you like.

08:47.814 --> 08:51.517
Also, Casper here is available

08:51.551 --> 08:52.985
as company photographer.

08:53.019 --> 08:55.720
Take your pictures.
Five bucks a pop.

08:55.755 --> 08:59.256
Uh, cash only please.
Thank you.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.824
Thank you.
All right.

09:00.858 --> 09:02.192
Not bad.

09:03.227 --> 09:04.861
You know, I individually own

09:04.895 --> 09:08.964
the largest fleet
of non-occupational ATVs

09:08.999 --> 09:13.001
in a non-resort area
in South Mexico.

09:13.035 --> 09:15.903
Man, our bond is just making
so much sense to me now, man.

09:15.937 --> 09:19.239
It's just like, you know,
I'm seriously into Jet Skis,

09:19.274 --> 09:21.875
and the experience they offer
is very similar to the ATVs,

09:21.909 --> 09:24.043
you know,
except that it's on water.

09:24.078 --> 09:27.647
Jet Skis are fun, sure,
but for me,

09:27.681 --> 09:30.683
being on the back of a TRX
or a Yamaha Grizzly,

09:30.717 --> 09:32.952
it just makes my dick hard.

09:32.986 --> 09:36.355
Yeah, I've actually had multiple
orgasms on Jet Skis.

09:36.390 --> 09:37.990
Whoa, back that ass up.

09:38.025 --> 09:39.826
Maybe it's something
in our blood

09:39.860 --> 09:41.294
that we can just, you know,
get hard

09:41.329 --> 09:43.527
from riding fucking badass,
you know,

09:43.562 --> 09:46.596
terrain vehicles, watercrafts.

09:48.131 --> 09:51.566
Have you ever climbed
to the top of a mountain

09:51.600 --> 09:53.935
on a Jet Ski?

09:56.207 --> 09:59.774
Man. You got me there. I have not.
Goddamn, that would be awesome.

10:02.244 --> 10:04.745
Someday maybe
we'll take that ride.

10:04.779 --> 10:07.114
I'd like that.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.683
Yeah.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.254
I gotta take a piss.

10:16.893 --> 10:18.427
Fuck.

10:18.461 --> 10:21.395
Whoo! Cheeseburger in paradise.

10:21.429 --> 10:22.762
How fucking badass is he?

10:22.797 --> 10:24.229
Fuck, man.

10:24.264 --> 10:27.497
I love the feel of the breeze
on my dick.

10:27.531 --> 10:31.265
Well, it looks like we found
what we were looking for.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.833
We sure did.

10:32.868 --> 10:35.870
Ooh, cheeseburgers in paradise.

10:35.904 --> 10:39.040
<i>âª Baby, I'm-a want you âª</i>

10:39.074 --> 10:41.442
<i>âª Baby, I'm-a need you âª</i>

10:42.677 --> 10:45.713
It's been real nice
having you here.

10:45.747 --> 10:47.981
You know, when you first
showed up,

10:48.016 --> 10:49.816
I gotta admit my first
thought was,

10:49.851 --> 10:51.852
"Goddamn, is he gonna ask me
for some money?"

10:51.886 --> 10:53.920
Heh. But you got
your own money.

10:53.955 --> 10:55.789
I can relax around you.

10:55.823 --> 10:59.493
That's a pretty cool-dude
thing of you to say.

10:59.528 --> 11:02.130
Do you wanna
tell me something, son?

11:03.266 --> 11:04.833
I bullshitted you, Pop.

11:04.867 --> 11:06.501
What are you talking about?

11:06.536 --> 11:09.704
Truth be told, things aren't
going as good for me

11:09.739 --> 11:12.407
as I let on to believe.

11:12.442 --> 11:14.577
The love of my life
married some other dude.

11:14.611 --> 11:16.679
And my new girlfriend,
fed her pussy to the owner

11:16.713 --> 11:19.415
of the baseball team
I just quit.

11:19.449 --> 11:20.916
I stole homeboy's car

11:20.951 --> 11:23.552
and now I'm probably
a wanted fucking fugitive.

11:23.586 --> 11:26.120
You stole that Lambo?

11:26.155 --> 11:27.221
Mm-hm.

11:27.256 --> 11:28.756
Oh, Kenny.

11:28.790 --> 11:31.727
I'm disappointed
you would lie to me.

11:31.761 --> 11:34.897
We're family.
I will not judge you.

11:34.931 --> 11:37.165
I just don't know
where it all went wrong.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.002
It just kind of seems like if
there was somebody in my life

11:41.037 --> 11:42.938
who I really trusted
and they could give me

11:42.972 --> 11:47.109
some awesome advice right now,
it might help.

11:47.143 --> 11:50.545
You mean like fatherly advice?

11:50.580 --> 11:53.515
Yeah, maybe just tell me
if I'm messing up

11:53.549 --> 11:55.050
by turning my back on baseball.

11:55.084 --> 11:57.852
Oh, hell no. Kenny, you can't
be running around

11:57.887 --> 11:59.921
worrying about every
goddamn bridge you burn.

11:59.956 --> 12:02.357
You'll never get
across the river.

12:02.391 --> 12:04.192
So you're saying
I did the right thing

12:04.226 --> 12:06.194
by running away
from all my problems?

12:06.228 --> 12:10.199
I believe you gotta do
what you feel in the moment.

12:10.233 --> 12:13.434
You gotta trust
in your feelings.

12:13.469 --> 12:17.739
If you wanna buy something
that you like, buy it.

12:17.773 --> 12:19.641
Don't worry about the money.
You just buy it.

12:19.675 --> 12:21.343
Yeah.
If you wanna have sex

12:21.377 --> 12:23.111
with a girl, have sex with her.

12:23.146 --> 12:25.347
You wanna leave
the condom off, go for it.

12:25.381 --> 12:27.282
It feels better that way.

12:27.317 --> 12:28.250
It does.

12:28.285 --> 12:30.819
I think you gotta do exactly

12:30.854 --> 12:34.356
what you wanna do, matter what.

12:34.391 --> 12:36.659
This makes so much sense.

12:36.693 --> 12:39.495
I mean, here I am
living with all these regrets,

12:39.529 --> 12:41.131
thinking I wronged
all these people

12:41.165 --> 12:42.265
and ruined my life.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.967
But you're saying I'm good.

12:44.001 --> 12:46.436
You're good.
Ha!

12:46.470 --> 12:47.837
Thank you, Pop.

12:47.871 --> 12:51.073
I honestly feel so confident
and just fucking bold and great

12:51.108 --> 12:52.942
about all my decisions
and actions now.

12:52.976 --> 12:54.043
Fuck it.

12:54.078 --> 12:55.612
Fuck it.

12:55.646 --> 12:56.613
To the moment.

12:57.949 --> 13:00.584
Hey, how's shit going over there
at the kids table?

13:00.619 --> 13:03.052
It sucks.

13:05.087 --> 13:06.854
Boys, I'm sorry
there's no room at the inn.

13:06.889 --> 13:09.190
Ah, no harm, no foul, Pop.

13:09.224 --> 13:10.758
I think it's just more rude
of Casper

13:10.792 --> 13:13.326
to not offer his bed
to guests, but whatever.

13:13.361 --> 13:14.661
Yeah, this will be good.

13:14.695 --> 13:18.297
All right, house rules:
No jerking each other off.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.399
This is my workspace and I don't
want you spraying all over

13:21.434 --> 13:22.734
all my inventions.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.635
We won't, Mr. Powers.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.171
Hey, thanks for showing us
a good time today,

13:27.205 --> 13:29.439
and I appreciate
all that advice.

13:29.474 --> 13:31.174
I look forward
to more tomorrow.

13:31.209 --> 13:34.243
All right.
Good night, son.

13:35.145 --> 13:36.478
Good night, Pop.

13:36.513 --> 13:38.714
Good night, Mr. Powers.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.956
Tell me a story, Kenny.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.458
Not tonight, Stevie.
Not tonight.

13:51.262 --> 13:53.563
The good thing about
getting over depression

13:53.598 --> 13:57.333
<i>is, well, you can start to see
your enemies more clearly.</i>

13:57.368 --> 14:00.569
<i>Suddenly everyone
isn't an obstacle.</i>

14:00.604 --> 14:01.904
<i>Just some people are.</i>

14:01.938 --> 14:03.739
<i>And they might be someone
that you find</i>

14:03.774 --> 14:05.007
<i>is in your bloodline.</i>

14:05.042 --> 14:07.076
<i>Distant and as brown
as their skin may be,</i>

14:07.110 --> 14:08.543
<i>they still are
a part of you.</i>

14:08.578 --> 14:10.712
<i>I'm not saying this
from a personal experience.</i>

14:10.746 --> 14:12.046
<i>I'm just saying in general,</i>

14:12.080 --> 14:14.682
<i>if you find someone
you don't like in your family,</i>

14:14.716 --> 14:16.851
<i>it is perfectly okay
to fuck them over.</i>

14:37.912 --> 14:40.380
- Did you piss?
- Yes, I did.

14:40.414 --> 14:42.115
<i>And my bladder
is el emptio.</i>

14:44.818 --> 14:47.787
Kenny, how long
are we gonna stay here?

14:47.821 --> 14:50.189
Well, it's hard to say, Stevie.

14:50.224 --> 14:53.159
I don't really got shit
going on back in Copales.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.827
Maybe I'll just live here.

14:54.861 --> 14:58.997
Get a job at Dirt Diablos
giving ATV tours. Who knows?

14:59.031 --> 15:03.500
No. No, you cannot do that.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.936
Says who?

15:05.970 --> 15:08.506
It's beneath you.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.241
Beneath me?

15:10.275 --> 15:12.343
Dirt Diablos is beneath me?

15:12.377 --> 15:13.577
Yes.

15:13.611 --> 15:15.979
Here my father gives us
a home to sleep in

15:16.014 --> 15:18.015
and a warm comfortable bed,

15:18.049 --> 15:19.549
and you sit here
and insult the life

15:19.584 --> 15:21.685
he worked so hard to build
outside of my family.

15:21.719 --> 15:23.387
That's not what I'm saying.

15:23.421 --> 15:28.225
Kenny, your dad is cool and all,
but you're not like him.

15:28.259 --> 15:30.060
You're supposed to be
in a baseball field,

15:30.095 --> 15:31.962
surrounded by millions
of people.

15:31.996 --> 15:34.064
Stevie, you don't think
I fucking know all this?

15:34.098 --> 15:35.799
I know it's not ideal, man,

15:35.833 --> 15:38.402
but right now it's the fucking
best option I have.

15:38.436 --> 15:41.672
So please just go back
to sleep on your hay bed

15:41.706 --> 15:43.374
and get some rest.

15:43.408 --> 15:46.343
I got a full day
of outdoing Casper

15:46.377 --> 15:47.911
and bonding with my father.

15:51.048 --> 15:53.216
Kenny, I have something
to tell you

15:53.251 --> 15:54.584
and I am scared
to tell you this...

15:54.619 --> 15:56.887
Stevie just go to sleep,
go to sleep.

15:56.921 --> 15:58.121
Steven go to sleep.
Kenny...

15:58.155 --> 16:00.023
Kenny, I lied.

16:00.057 --> 16:02.959
April and Cutler
are not married.

16:02.994 --> 16:05.295
What the fuck did you just say?

16:05.329 --> 16:06.362
I lied to you.

16:06.397 --> 16:08.031
I lied to you and I'm sorry.

16:08.065 --> 16:09.965
It's just that
when I came down here,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.268
I missed you so much
that I thought...

16:12.303 --> 16:14.504
I thought we could
start our own life here,

16:14.539 --> 16:15.839
where we were just two outlaws

16:15.873 --> 16:19.309
that are just like friends
and doing great...

16:19.343 --> 16:21.144
Aah!

16:22.680 --> 16:24.013
Oh, God. You hit me.

16:24.048 --> 16:25.114
I deserved it.

16:25.149 --> 16:26.783
Yes, you did, Stevie.

16:26.817 --> 16:28.884
I can't believe you'd lie
about that.

16:28.919 --> 16:31.787
Look, I have never
understood the love

16:31.822 --> 16:34.189
between a man
and a woman before

16:34.224 --> 16:35.490
until I met Maria.

16:35.525 --> 16:39.594
And now I realize that
what I did was not right.

16:39.629 --> 16:41.295
It was wrong.

16:41.330 --> 16:44.832
This is some heavy shit
you're dropping on me here.

16:44.867 --> 16:47.001
Kenny, you cannot stay here.

16:47.035 --> 16:49.069
You can still get her back.

16:51.339 --> 16:52.372
Get her back?

16:52.407 --> 16:53.773
Yeah.

16:53.808 --> 16:54.874
Yeah, right.

16:54.909 --> 16:57.376
Nope, it's over, Stevie.

16:57.411 --> 16:58.978
It's time I take
my dad's advice:

16:59.012 --> 17:00.513
Stop thinking about
other people,

17:00.548 --> 17:03.185
start thinking about me
for once.

17:03.219 --> 17:05.053
Kenny.

17:05.087 --> 17:07.021
I've found my place, Stevie.

17:07.056 --> 17:09.057
If you don't like it,
you can leave.

17:09.090 --> 17:11.292
I intend to enjoy myself.

17:15.665 --> 17:17.598
<i>âª Oogum, oogum
Boogum, boogum âª</i>

17:17.634 --> 17:21.369
<i>âª Boogum, now, baby you're
Casting your spell on me âª</i>

17:23.339 --> 17:27.642
<i>âª You got me doing funny things
Like a clown âª</i>

17:27.675 --> 17:29.143
<i>âª Just look at me âª</i>

17:31.813 --> 17:34.281
<i>âª When you wear
Your high-heel boots âª</i>

17:34.316 --> 17:38.752
<i>âª With your hip-hugging suit
Huh, it's all right âª</i>

17:38.786 --> 17:40.652
<i>âª You're out of sight âª</i>

17:45.124 --> 17:46.858
Yep, this is the spot.

17:46.893 --> 17:49.628
You gents ever hit this shit?

17:49.662 --> 17:51.530
Does the pope blow little kids?

17:52.998 --> 17:54.198
I figured you did.

17:54.233 --> 17:55.700
I wasn't sure
about Steven there,

17:55.734 --> 17:57.601
but, uh, to be honest,

17:57.636 --> 18:00.937
I'm still kind of up in the air
about what gender he really is.

18:00.972 --> 18:03.606
What? I am obviously
a man, sir.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.275
Ha! Well, that's not
what your pussy doctor says.

18:06.309 --> 18:08.845
Ha-ha!
A fucking pussy doctor!

18:11.782 --> 18:12.949
Man, oh, man.

18:12.983 --> 18:14.683
This is crazy as shit.

18:14.717 --> 18:16.584
Here, after all this time,

18:16.618 --> 18:19.153
two journeyman, father and son.

18:19.187 --> 18:20.254
Thank you.

18:20.289 --> 18:21.889
Getting high as hell in Mexico.

18:21.923 --> 18:25.726
Just smoking herb and riding
around on recreational vehicles.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.661
I kind of feel like this is how
I was always meant to live.

18:28.695 --> 18:30.896
I've been doing a lot
of soul-searching lately,

18:30.930 --> 18:33.966
and seeing how well me and you
are reconnecting,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.802
I was thinking about sticking
around here for a while.

18:37.837 --> 18:39.571
Because I love you, Dad.

18:40.773 --> 18:43.007
Huh.

18:43.041 --> 18:45.442
I don't usually say "love"
to other dudes.

18:45.477 --> 18:47.010
That's something that's,
you know,

18:47.045 --> 18:49.179
not really on my docket
of shit to do.

18:49.213 --> 18:51.348
But for some reason,
it just feels normal

18:51.382 --> 18:52.549
to say it to you, Pop.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.017
I like it.
I could fucking sit here

18:54.052 --> 18:55.786
and just talk about love
all goddamn day.

18:55.820 --> 18:57.788
Love, love this.
Love smoking weed...

18:57.822 --> 18:59.089
But you don't have to.

18:59.123 --> 19:00.557
I know, but it just...
I don't know.

19:00.591 --> 19:02.325
I just haven't never
done that before.

19:02.359 --> 19:05.094
I think it's okay
for men to have feelings

19:05.129 --> 19:08.231
that they don't
want to express a lot

19:08.265 --> 19:11.467
but that sometimes
they do express.

19:11.502 --> 19:13.336
I think it's okay.
No.

19:13.371 --> 19:15.238
Nope it's not.
Not for you to do it, it's not.

19:15.272 --> 19:16.906
Give that to me.
Thank you.

19:16.941 --> 19:19.175
Don't give him
anymore of that shit.

19:19.210 --> 19:20.143
No, that's a good rule.

19:20.177 --> 19:22.445
You seem a little distracted

19:22.480 --> 19:24.814
from our pinnacle father/son
bonding moment here.

19:24.849 --> 19:25.882
Everything cool?

19:25.916 --> 19:28.518
Yeah. No, I just thought
I heard something.

19:28.552 --> 19:30.553
Oh, you're getting
a little fucking paranoid?

19:32.890 --> 19:35.058
Old Pops fucking getting stoned
like a 14-year-old

19:35.092 --> 19:36.993
Scared thinking the fucking cops
are coming.

19:39.530 --> 19:41.631
All right,
now don't do anything stupid.

19:41.665 --> 19:44.100
Oh, who the fuck is this?
The cops are coming for real?

19:46.437 --> 19:47.770
These two are the bandidos.

19:47.805 --> 19:50.506
I'm the one that made the call.
Code name Emerald.

19:50.540 --> 19:51.673
Emerald.

19:51.708 --> 19:53.409
You cocksucker.
You betrayed me?

19:53.443 --> 19:55.677
Now... Now don't take it
personally, son.

19:55.712 --> 19:57.079
It's just Mexico.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.581
Goddamn it. Just Mexico?
What kind of shit is this?

19:59.616 --> 20:03.352
Goddamn it! No, I ain't going.
Okay, I'm coming. Fuck.

20:03.386 --> 20:04.987
Oh, shit!

20:05.021 --> 20:07.122
All right, uh, where do I go
to pick up the bounty?

20:07.157 --> 20:09.091
There is no bounty.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.392
Oh, now that's bullshit.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.427
Those two are fugitives.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.495
I turned them in.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.163
A man ought to get a reward.

20:15.198 --> 20:17.899
Now let's just cut through
the Mexican red tape right now.

20:17.934 --> 20:19.634
Yeah, you're right.
Go home, Eduardo.

20:19.669 --> 20:21.736
We'll get it from here.

20:21.771 --> 20:23.004
Fucking snitch.

20:23.039 --> 20:25.540
Oh, you fucking...
Oh, jackals. Fuck.

20:25.575 --> 20:26.708
Okay, I'm in.

20:32.048 --> 20:34.382
Unbelievable!

20:34.417 --> 20:35.917
Asshole.

20:35.952 --> 20:38.787
I know that it hurts a lot.

20:38.821 --> 20:41.590
Just know that
if you want to cry,

20:41.624 --> 20:45.460
you can and I will not
judge you.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.929
Stevie, I'm not sad, dude.

20:47.964 --> 20:49.864
I'm more just fucking mad.

20:49.899 --> 20:52.033
And I should have
saw this coming.

20:52.068 --> 20:53.335
Me and him are exactly the same

20:53.369 --> 20:56.104
except, you know,
I have talent.

20:56.138 --> 20:58.640
What a fucking mess
everything's become.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.475
<i>Powers.
SÃ­.</i>

21:00.509 --> 21:02.177
Someone paid your bail.

21:02.211 --> 21:03.645
I do paperwork.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.647
Oh, you do.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.582
Hello, Kenny.

21:07.616 --> 21:09.150
Soledad.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.718
You paid to have me freed?

21:10.752 --> 21:11.719
Mm-hm.

21:11.753 --> 21:14.422
Uh, could you pay
to have me free too?

21:14.457 --> 21:16.424
See why the fuck are you always
trying to horn in

21:16.458 --> 21:18.092
on my moments, dude?
Fine.

21:18.126 --> 21:20.995
I'll just go back here
in Mexican jail.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.330
Goddamn.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.665
I can arrange to have
your friend freed as well.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.068
Yeah, in time.
I want answers first.

21:27.102 --> 21:29.503
Your daddy's
a real motherfucker.

21:29.537 --> 21:31.372
I don't know why
you came to find him.

21:31.406 --> 21:33.574
You don't want to end up
like him.

21:33.608 --> 21:35.275
I mean, he doesn't seem so bad.

21:35.310 --> 21:39.381
He's married to you and owns
a successful ATV tour company.

21:39.415 --> 21:41.449
He doesn't own the company.
I do.

21:41.484 --> 21:44.319
His lazy ass has been
mooching off my tit for years.

21:44.353 --> 21:47.789
Hm, so not only
did he fucking sell me out

21:47.823 --> 21:50.391
to the Federales,
but he also is lying about

21:50.425 --> 21:52.126
his whole entire deal here
in Mexico?

21:52.161 --> 21:53.995
- Yes, he is.
- Goddamn it.

21:54.029 --> 21:55.629
What a motherfucker.

21:55.664 --> 21:57.665
Well, where is he?

21:57.699 --> 22:00.234
He's in the car.

22:00.268 --> 22:02.469
Just so you know,

22:02.503 --> 22:05.205
I'm planning on leaving him.

22:06.574 --> 22:09.742
If you want to stick around.

22:09.777 --> 22:11.377
Ooh.

22:11.412 --> 22:13.045
How fucked up
would that be, huh?

22:13.080 --> 22:15.047
Oh, very nasty.

22:15.082 --> 22:16.616
Ooh, you guys are bad.

22:16.650 --> 22:19.552
Why are you shitting
in the prison, Stevie?

22:19.586 --> 22:22.522
Stop looking at me shit!
Stop it!

22:22.556 --> 22:25.725
Haven't you guys ever heard
of Montezuma's revenge?

22:25.759 --> 22:29.629
If you guys knew how
to boil meat or grill it,

22:29.663 --> 22:32.398
this shit
wouldn't be happening.

22:43.778 --> 22:44.878
Well?

22:47.148 --> 22:49.816
I'm sorry I turned you over
to the cops.

22:49.817 --> 22:51.651
Are you sorry for real
or are you just sorry

22:51.686 --> 22:53.219
because Soledad's
is making you?

22:53.254 --> 22:55.588
That woman
can't make me do shit.

22:55.623 --> 22:57.490
Why? Because you wear the pants
in the family

22:57.525 --> 22:58.825
and own the ATV company?

22:59.927 --> 23:01.795
Or because
you're fucking lying?

23:01.829 --> 23:03.530
She blew my cover, huh?

23:03.564 --> 23:04.931
Yeah, you bet your ass she did,

23:04.965 --> 23:06.099
and I'm glad she did.

23:06.133 --> 23:08.101
I came down here looking
for guidance from you,

23:08.135 --> 23:09.903
and instead you intentionally
fucked me.

23:09.937 --> 23:12.138
I just don't understand
why you fucking lied.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.107
Oh, fuck off!

23:14.141 --> 23:18.044
What are you coming back at me
all high and mighty?

23:18.078 --> 23:19.412
You're no angel.

23:19.446 --> 23:21.714
You think what you're doing down
here is any different?

23:21.749 --> 23:23.349
Running around Mexico
talking about

23:23.384 --> 23:25.752
how you wanna get back
in the majors.

23:28.522 --> 23:31.257
You're living a lie, son.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.893
Welcome to the club.

23:33.927 --> 23:35.795
Crazy.

23:35.829 --> 23:38.964
Here I grow up a whole
entire world away from you

23:38.999 --> 23:41.500
and end up exactly like you.

23:41.534 --> 23:45.871
A lying, cheating,
backstabbing gigolo.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.407
Well, you know what?

23:48.442 --> 23:51.477
I don't think I wanna be
like you anymore.

23:51.511 --> 23:54.814
Well, maybe I'll see you
in hell then.

23:54.848 --> 23:59.018
The old Powers men tag team
and a couple of she-devils.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.488
I got two hard rules
I live by, Pop.

24:02.522 --> 24:04.556
I don't fuck with the devil

24:04.591 --> 24:07.426
and I never do tag teams
with blood relatives.

24:08.728 --> 24:10.562
Take it easy, old man.

24:15.601 --> 24:16.768
Where are you going?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.537
Home.

24:18.571 --> 24:20.072
Can we give you a lift?

24:20.106 --> 24:21.840
Nah, I think we're good.

24:21.874 --> 24:23.775
So are we just gonna walk?

24:23.810 --> 24:26.311
No, Stevie, we're not gonna
fucking walk.

24:53.838 --> 24:56.907
