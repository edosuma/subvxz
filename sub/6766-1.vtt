WEBVTT

00:18.601 --> 00:20.270
{\an3}Excuse me.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.271
Is this seat taken?

00:21.354 --> 00:23.106
No.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.315
Do you mind?

00:31.197 --> 00:32.448
{\an1}Thanks.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.951
{\an1}They stuck me in the back
there all by myself.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.494
I really hate to fly alone.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.789
{\an1}Especially
all the way to L.A.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.249
So, let me guess.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.793
{\an1}Are you heading to the coast
for an audition?

00:43.877 --> 00:46.796
{\an3}No. I'm going home,
back to college.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.423
College?

00:48.506 --> 00:50.967
What's your major,
driving men wild?

00:51.050 --> 00:53.428
(laughs):
Not exactly.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.014
Psychology.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.683
{\an3}Are you traveling
to L.A. on business?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.143
Sort of. I'm an artist.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.312
{\an1}I'm moving to a new
studio in Venice.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.940
{\an3}You know, I live
right on the beach.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.776
{\an3}That practically
makes us neighbors.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.986
{\an1}Great. I don't know
a soul out there.

01:10.069 --> 01:12.197
{\an1}Maybe you can give me
the grand tour.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.657
{\an1}Or at least tell me
where I can find

01:14.741 --> 01:15.867
a decent all-night deli.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.994
{\an1}I'd be glad to.
You know,

01:18.077 --> 01:20.413
you have incredible eyes.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.999
And that mouth,

01:23.082 --> 01:24.667
it's like a ripe strawberry.

01:24.751 --> 01:28.588
{\an4}(laughs):
Oh, I can't believe
I said that.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.689
{\an1}This is just
a stab in the dark,

01:46.773 --> 01:49.526
{\an1}but are you a member
of the Mile-High Club?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.027
{\an3}Excuse me?

01:51.110 --> 01:53.738
The Mile-High Club.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.698
(laughs)

02:00.119 --> 02:03.081
It's easy to join.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.386
{\an3}Did you see that?
That was great!

02:16.469 --> 02:17.887
{\an1}God, I've always
wanted to do that.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.391
{\an5}All summer in New York
I knew you were crazy,
but this was hilarious.

02:21.474 --> 02:25.770
{\an4}I thought that one guy
in the gray suit was gonna
choke on his smoked almonds.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.065
{\an5}So, what do we do now?
Stay in here
for a little while,

02:29.149 --> 02:31.776
{\an1}really drive 'em crazy.
Hmm.

02:31.860 --> 02:35.238
{\an3}That'll be easy-- 'cause
you do drive me crazy.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.869
{\an5}WOMAN (over speakers):
The captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belt" sign.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.912
Please return to your seats...

02:42.996 --> 02:45.915
{\an3}I guess we won't be joining
the Mile-High Club this trip.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.376
That's all right-- it's
the thought that counts.

02:48.459 --> 02:49.502
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

Val?

05:19.694 --> 05:22.655
Anybody home?

05:24.198 --> 05:26.075
(sighs)

05:27.952 --> 05:29.787
Great.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.669
I wonder who's been sleeping
in Papa Bear's bed?

05:38.046 --> 05:40.089
(tired sigh)

05:52.393 --> 05:53.811
Hi.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.438
Good morning.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.066
You must be Brandon.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.610
(laughs):
I must be dreaming.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.404
Would you mind telling me
what the hell you're doing here?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.989
Does it matter?

06:07.533 --> 06:09.786
No. No, I guess it...
really doesn't.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.704
(speaks unintelligibly)

06:14.832 --> 06:17.335
I thought I heard
something in here.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.546
(chuckles):
Val!

06:20.630 --> 06:22.799
Hi. I'm home.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.634
So I've noticed.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.885
(chuckles)

06:25.968 --> 06:26.803
(clears throat)

06:26.886 --> 06:30.473
{\an1}Brandon, this is
my best friend from Buffalo,

06:30.556 --> 06:31.641
{\an1}Ginger.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.935
Yeah, we've, uh, we've met.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.520
(chuckles)

06:35.603 --> 06:37.605
I've been hanging out here
for a couple of weeks.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.232
{\an3}I hope you
don't mind.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.442
No, no, don't mind at all.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.445
(chuckles)

06:44.529 --> 06:46.155
Well, I better go

06:46.239 --> 06:48.825
and hit the showers.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.660
(sighs)

06:50.743 --> 06:53.746
{\an1}(door closes)
So, welcome home.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.415
{\an5}(chuckles,
clears throat)
It's been three months.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.835
{\an3}Thanks. It's
good to be home.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.169
(shower running)

07:00.253 --> 07:01.504
Yeah.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.672
Yeah.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.134
{\an1}You know, if you
would've called first,

07:06.217 --> 07:09.512
{\an1}I could've had her
gift-wrapped for you.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.640
(sighs)

07:12.723 --> 07:15.309
COLIN:
<i>You know what?</i>

07:15.393 --> 07:17.812
Remind me never to get
involved with a model.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.397
{\an3}They have way too
many suitcases.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.942
Yes, but look
at the upside.

07:23.025 --> 07:27.238
Yes. You have one
hell of an upside.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.199
{\an5}Not a bad
backside, either.
(laughs)

07:32.660 --> 07:35.121
{\an3}So, this is
your place, huh?

07:35.204 --> 07:37.165
This is it.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.374
Huh.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.459
What is this?

07:41.961 --> 07:43.546
A Rodin?

07:43.629 --> 07:45.715
No, it must be
a Henry Moore.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.466
Put that down.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.345
And I love the posters.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.890
Did you get these
at the student bookstore?

07:53.973 --> 07:55.933
Excuse me if it's not fine art.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.727
{\an3}It doesn't have
to be fine,

07:57.810 --> 07:58.811
just original.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.812
I guess you're right.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.356
I never realized
how tacky this place really is.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.734
How tacky what is?

08:04.817 --> 08:06.569
{\an1}Hi!
Hi!

08:06.652 --> 08:09.488
Welcome...

08:10.615 --> 08:11.741
...home.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.076
{\an1}Clare Arnold,
this is Colin Robbins.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.578
My artist friend.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.747
{\an3}Hi.
Hi.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.916
{\an1}"Colin Robbins' work
attains a...

08:19.999 --> 08:21.709
"formal depth and radiance,

08:21.792 --> 08:24.629
{\an5}"yet reflects the
tangential nature
of living in a...

08:24.712 --> 08:27.215
{\an1}fast-moving,
media-filled environment."

08:27.298 --> 08:29.300
<i>Art News.</i> July.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.553
She has a photographic memory.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.597
I'm impressed.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.097
So am I.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.768
Do you always go around
quoting art magazines?

08:38.851 --> 08:41.270
{\an6}CLARE:
Only when my roommate's
dating the artist.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.772
{\an3}Well, I'm...
I'm flattered.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.315
{\an3}And I'd love
to stick around,

08:44.398 --> 08:46.108
but I've got to
meet my landlord

08:46.192 --> 08:47.902
{\an5}and pick up my keys.
KELLY:
Yes.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.238
Colin rented a loft in Venice.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.156
{\an6}Oh.
As soon as
I get set up,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.116
{\an3}you should come over
and see my studio.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.701
{\an3}Sure, yeah, cool.
All right.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.620
{\an1}Bye.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.288
I'll call you later.
Okay.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.207
See ya.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.961
(gasps):
He is so beautiful.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.420
{\an5}I know.
How'd you meet
him again?

09:06.504 --> 09:08.589
I told you, I was doing
this shoot in Tribeca...

09:24.397 --> 09:25.773
Hey there, sailor.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.441
{\an1}You thirsty?
Thank you.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.985
Oh, it's such
a beautiful day.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.611
You know,
I wish this summer

09:30.695 --> 09:31.487
would never end.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.322
{\an3}I never thought I
could be this happy.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.782
Well, God knows
I never thought

09:34.865 --> 09:36.450
{\an1}I'd find myself
in a place like this.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.493
Yeah, well, my dad says

09:37.576 --> 09:39.328
{\an3}you're the best first
mate in the yacht club.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.955
{\an1}I wish we could just
stay on this boat

09:41.038 --> 09:42.039
and sail away, you know?

09:42.123 --> 09:44.500
{\an3}Well, chart a course,
and I'm there.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.793
{\an3}(giggles)

09:51.340 --> 09:52.675
Ahoy, mates!

09:52.758 --> 09:54.343
Hi, Daddy.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.096
{\an3}Say, you want to take
her out for a shakedown

09:57.179 --> 09:58.472
before tomorrow's race?

09:58.556 --> 10:00.308
{\an3}Sure, let's go.
Who would've thought

10:00.391 --> 10:02.059
{\an3}a couple of city
guys like us

10:02.143 --> 10:03.644
would've made such
great sailors, huh?

10:03.728 --> 10:04.979
Thanks, Dr. Martin.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.856
I've had a great time, really.

10:06.939 --> 10:07.898
Good. Look, you cast off.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.359
I'm gonna go downstairs
and power her up, okay?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.195
All righty, Cap'n.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.031
You know, my dad
really digs you.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.325
{\an1}Your whole family's been
so great to me this summer.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.785
{\an3}Yeah, well, you've been
pretty great to <i> me</i> lately.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.871
Well, I'm glad you noticed,

10:21.954 --> 10:24.248
{\an1}'cause I love you a lot,
and I'm really trying

10:24.332 --> 10:26.375
{\an1}to make up for what
happened in Palm Springs.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.961
Well, I think it's working.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.723
So, how was Boston?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.391
Ate a lot of lobster,

10:42.475 --> 10:44.101
{\an3}proofread a lot
of obituaries

10:44.185 --> 10:45.728
for stuffy Brahmins.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.064
But working at the <i> Herald</i>
was cool.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.191
Well, you guys,
I'm headed for the gym.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.734
You want to come, Brandon?

10:52.777 --> 10:54.028
No, thanks, I, uh,

10:54.111 --> 10:55.112
I drove all night.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.073
{\an3}I think I'd better
get some sleep.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.283
I hope you won't be
lonely without me.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.248
She's a piece of work.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.585
Yeah, well, she was my only
friend after I left Minnesota.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.253
She's still a piece of work.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.589
You know,
I'm glad you came home.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.257
I really missed you.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.094
It was really hard seeing them
take everything out of here.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.762
So, how long you been living
without furniture?

11:19.845 --> 11:22.598
Well, everything went
into storage last week.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.850
Heard from
the dragon lady lately?

11:24.934 --> 11:28.604
Oh, yes. The lovely Candace
was here yesterday.

11:28.687 --> 11:32.233
{\an3}So, escrow's gonna
close next week, huh?

11:32.316 --> 11:33.401
Yeah, finally.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.444
It was supposed
to close in June.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.780
At least you had a place
to live this summer.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.615
{\an1}You know, you didn't
have to rush back.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.951
{\an5}I could've handled
things on my own.
Uh-uh.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.413
I had to say good-bye
to Casa Walsh myself.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.460
(sighs):
So, where you gonna live?

11:52.586 --> 11:53.879
I don't know.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.132
Ginger's thinking
about staying here in L.A.,

11:56.215 --> 11:59.093
and if she does,
maybe we'll move in together.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.010
How about you?

12:00.094 --> 12:02.638
Tell me that moving in
with Steve Sanders

12:02.721 --> 12:04.974
is not the stupidest idea
I ever had.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.475
Well, think of it this way--

12:06.559 --> 12:09.186
you'll learn how to buy beer
in six languages.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.189
Great.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.193
{\an1}Don't let me sleep
through dinner, huh?

12:16.277 --> 12:17.862
{\an3}I won't.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.823
Hey, Brandon?

12:20.906 --> 12:22.324
Yeah?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.200
(sighs)

12:23.284 --> 12:26.871
What happened between us
before you left?

12:28.372 --> 12:30.166
I mean, have you thought
about it at all?

12:30.249 --> 12:34.336
Yeah.

12:34.420 --> 12:38.215
I don't think we should pick up
where we left off, do you?

12:41.552 --> 12:42.720
I don't know.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.722
Come on, Val, you were there.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.057
The minute
we took our clothes off,

12:47.141 --> 12:48.058
we started laughing
uncontrollably.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.020
I knew we should have
turned off the lights.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.521
It was my tattoo, wasn't it?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.274
(chuckles):
No, it wasn't.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.402
Val, you're beautiful,

12:58.486 --> 13:00.863
and unbelievably sexy,

13:00.946 --> 13:03.532
but we both know
it's just too weird.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.160
I know.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.329
I just had a lousy summer,
that's all.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.788
I thought you were dating
a Dodger?

13:09.872 --> 13:11.665
Actually, he was an Angel.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.334
More like a devil.
I don't know.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.836
We had fun until they sent him
down to the minors.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.921
You ruined his game?

13:17.004 --> 13:18.714
I know. I feel terrible.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.717
{\an1}But that's not
the worst part of it.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.220
What could possibly be worse
than that?

13:24.303 --> 13:26.555
Honestly?

13:26.639 --> 13:30.434
I haven't talked to the gang
except for Steve all summer.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.061
I mean, Clare and Donna
won't return my calls,

13:32.144 --> 13:33.896
and if Kelly was here,

13:33.979 --> 13:35.439
she probably wouldn't
talk to me either.

13:35.523 --> 13:39.068
Val, everyone goes their
separate ways during the summer.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.904
That's just the way it goes.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.739
Give 'em a chance,
they'll come around.

13:43.822 --> 13:44.740
You'll see.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.243
{\an3}I promise.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.120
You told me that six months ago,
and nothing's changed.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.876
If Ginger goes back home,
I think I'm gonna go with her.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.421
Well, you can't do that.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.257
Why?

14:01.340 --> 14:05.344
Because you're the only family
I got left here.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.100
You mean that?

14:11.183 --> 14:14.687
Yeah, I do.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.150
Thanks.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.954
{\an1}I can't believe
with pictures like this,

14:32.037 --> 14:34.415
{\an1}you're actually
going back to school.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.874
{\an1}What for?

14:35.958 --> 14:38.210
{\an3}I don't want to be just
another pretty face.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.295
If I'm gonna keep modeling,

14:39.378 --> 14:40.754
{\an3}I want to be
completely in control.

14:40.838 --> 14:41.880
{\an1}I forgot.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.758
The new Kelly Taylor doesn't
take any crap from anybody.

14:44.842 --> 14:45.801
{\an3}That's right.
(knocking)

14:45.884 --> 14:46.802
I'll get it.

14:46.885 --> 14:50.306
{\an1}Oh, I'm gonna go
to bed.

14:52.891 --> 14:53.767
Anybody home?

14:53.851 --> 14:56.270
Hey, stranger.
How did you know I was back?

14:56.353 --> 14:57.980
I hear things.

14:58.063 --> 14:58.981
Could I come in?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.566
Yeah.

15:03.902 --> 15:06.071
So, how was your summer?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.114
{\an1}Good.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.491
{\an1}Yeah?
Yeah.

15:09.575 --> 15:16.498
Wow, you really did
some beautiful work.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.628
That is beautiful.

15:20.711 --> 15:21.879
That's my favorite.
Can I have one?

15:21.962 --> 15:24.298
{\an3}Right here.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.008
That's my favorite one, too.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.510
{\an3}Yeah.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.845
How was your trip?

15:31.055 --> 15:33.474
Well, my passport's got a stamp
on every page.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.184
I'm right back where I started.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.900
{\an1}Well, I'm not back
where I started.

15:42.983 --> 15:46.445
{\an1}I mean, we're not back
where we started.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.405
I didn't come here
to talk about us.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.699
Good.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.493
What?

15:54.078 --> 15:55.454
You know what this is?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.167
That's your dad's watch.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.169
{\an3}Yeah.

16:02.252 --> 16:07.383
On my last stop in Mexico,
I went back to retrieve it.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.720
I had left it at some cantina
to cover a bar tab.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.722
Well, I'm glad you got it back.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.599
I know it means a lot to you.

16:17.976 --> 16:21.438
Yeah, I'll never get him back,
though.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.774
Till I find out
who killed Jack,

16:23.857 --> 16:29.571
I can't go back to anything,
anybody.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.700
His things are in a storage
facility in the Valley.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.369
I made an appointment.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.583
Dylan, I can't do that with you.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.544
Why not?

16:43.627 --> 16:44.545
You were there.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.131
You knew him.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.216
I can't do it alone.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.845
I need a friend.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.890
Friends.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.976
You're sure that's all you want?

16:59.059 --> 17:01.437
That's all.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.454
GINGER:
<i>Hey.</i>

17:19.538 --> 17:21.080
{\an3}Hey, guys.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.583
Who wants some caviar?

17:22.665 --> 17:24.126
{\an3}Depends.
Who paid for it?

17:24.209 --> 17:25.127
I did.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.295
Uh-huh.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.714
She's getting a little carried
away with Beverly Hills.

17:28.797 --> 17:29.882
When in Rome...

17:29.965 --> 17:32.134
{\an5}Not the Rome I know.
COMPUTER VOICE:
You have mail.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.637
Hey, look at this. I already got
some e-mail from Jim and Cindy.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.972
What does it say?

17:37.055 --> 17:37.848
It says, "Dear Brandon.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.934
"Please call us
as soon as you get this.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.561
Love, Mom and Dad."
Isn't that cute?

17:42.644 --> 17:44.313
So much for the information
superhighway.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.314
No kidding.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.982
Hello, Mr. Walsh?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.859
COMPUTER VOICE:
Good-bye.

17:48.942 --> 17:49.985
Hey, bud.

17:50.068 --> 17:52.112
{\an1}Hey.
How's it goin'?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.989
David, how you doin', man?
You guys know Ginger?

17:54.072 --> 17:54.990
I've had the pleasure.

17:55.073 --> 17:56.825
He wishes he'd had the pleasure.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.578
{\an4}Ouch.
Ouch, stab me in the heart,
why don't you?

18:00.746 --> 18:01.663
I'm David Silver.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.540
Ginger Lamont.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.000
{\an3}Hi.
Lamont?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.795
Since when?
It's Ginger LaMonica.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.547
Where have you been hiding him?
He's cute.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.009
Well, David, you got
the seal of approval

18:14.092 --> 18:15.177
from Buffalo's finest.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.261
Thanks.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.014
Brandon, we're about
to make you a very happy man.

18:19.097 --> 18:20.641
{\an3}How's that?
Tell him, Silver.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.644
Well, one of my dad's patients,
this divorced guy,

18:23.727 --> 18:27.022
{\an3}has this incredible apartment
in a high-rise on Wilshire.

18:27.105 --> 18:28.524
{\an1}Now he got back together
with his wife,

18:28.607 --> 18:30.317
so he's, he's kind of
stuck with the place.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.485
It looks like we can get it,

18:31.568 --> 18:32.986
{\an1}furnished,
for practically nothing,

18:33.070 --> 18:35.239
but we gotta move now,
otherwise we lose it.

18:36.990 --> 18:37.908
Bye, ladies.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.868
Bye.
See ya.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.578
Nice meeting you.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.706
(knocking)

18:44.790 --> 18:45.749
Brandon!

18:45.833 --> 18:47.167
{\an3}Candace.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.168
Welcome home!

18:48.252 --> 18:49.461
Thank you!

18:49.545 --> 18:50.754
{\an1}With escrow due
to close,

18:50.838 --> 18:52.714
we just have to tie up
a few loose ends.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.051
{\an1}Oh, Valerie,
darling, hello.

18:56.134 --> 18:57.594
Hi, Candace.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.681
{\an4}Uh, there may be
an inspector or two
dropping by,

19:00.764 --> 19:01.890
but other than that, that's it.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.227
Great, great, I know the place
is kind of a mess right now,

19:05.310 --> 19:06.937
but we'll make sure
it's spotless.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.564
{\an1}Oh, that won't be
necessary.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.857
It won't be?

19:09.940 --> 19:13.735
No. The people who are buying it
are planning to tear it down.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.822
{\an1}You can trash this place
if you want to.

19:16.905 --> 19:20.784
{\an1}Well, we're not really
the trashing types.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.286
{\an1}CANDACE:
Oh, I gotta run.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.413
Call me day or night.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.247
Okay? Bye-bye, darling.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.248
You got it.
Bye, gang.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.710
{\an3}Bye-bye.
(chuckles)

19:29.793 --> 19:32.254
{\an1}Who would want
to tear down this house?

19:32.337 --> 19:33.797
I love this house.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.132
Oh, Brandon, get over it.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.758
{\an1}This is no time
to be sentimental.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.468
{\an1}You know what
this means, don't you?

19:38.552 --> 19:39.761
No.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.597
Brandon, think about it.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.682
She said we could trash
this place.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.975
So?

19:45.058 --> 19:47.102
{\an1}So...

19:47.185 --> 19:48.770
that means we can party.

19:48.854 --> 19:53.734
P-A-R-T... Why?
Because we got to!

19:53.817 --> 19:55.569
(both grunting loudly)

20:07.456 --> 20:09.791
Whew!

20:09.875 --> 20:11.960
{\an1}It'll take days to go
through all this stuff.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.463
{\an3}Yeah, I probably should have
done this a long time ago.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.715
Why didn't you?

20:16.798 --> 20:17.799
I don't know.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.468
You know maybe it's best

20:19.551 --> 20:21.803
that you don't find out
who killed Jack.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.306
{\an1}Shouldn't the police
be doing this?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.433
Yeah, they should.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.685
So should the FBI, but they're
not, that's the problem, Kel.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.562
Nobody's doing anything.
That's why we're here.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.942
{\an1}What are we looking
for, anyway?

20:35.025 --> 20:39.363
I don't know-- contracts,
memo, fax, phone message.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.697
Anything with
a clue on it.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.534
{\an1}I wish you could
just leave well enough alone.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.161
So do a lot of people.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.829
Maybe they're right.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.706
Maybe they're not.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.707
Why'd you come here anyway?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.209
Are you gonna help me
look through this stuff

20:52.292 --> 20:53.502
or are you gonna give me
a hard time?

20:53.585 --> 20:55.003
{\an1}Fine.
Where do I start?

20:55.087 --> 20:57.798
Pick a box. Any box.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.342
♪ Put the top down. ♪

21:00.425 --> 21:01.843
{\an1}STEVE:
Nice wheels, Walsh.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.804
Thanks. Guilt gift
from Jim and Cindy.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.180
{\an3}They couldn't live
with themselves

21:05.263 --> 21:06.723
leaving me here
all by myself.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.849
Aw, you poor baby.

21:07.933 --> 21:08.850
{\an3}Yeah.

21:08.934 --> 21:09.893
Ah, check it out.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.146
{\an4}Hey.
Oh, it's good
to be back in L.A.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.856
{\an1}So how were the girls
in Boston?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.900
A pale comparison.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.319
But I went out with them anyway.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.363
Good to know it wasn't all work
for our cub reporter, huh?

21:21.446 --> 21:23.699
Oh, no, summer of lust.
How 'bout you boys?

21:23.782 --> 21:24.866
Oh, not quite.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.201
Clare broke up with him.

21:26.284 --> 21:27.869
Steve, I broke up with her.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.496
{\an3}Come on. That was
two months ago.

21:29.579 --> 21:30.831
What you gonna do,
mourn forever?

21:30.914 --> 21:32.541
And what's with that haircut?

21:32.624 --> 21:34.001
You look like a Buddhist monk.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.377
I hope you don't mind
me telling you.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.336
{\an3}You'd better trim
that off before

21:36.420 --> 21:37.379
{\an3}something nests
in it, man.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.839
Enough, all right?
I'm not mourning.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.048
{\an1}I've been out,
like, twice.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.675
{\an3}Oh, you're breaking
my heart, Silver.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.510
No, no, don't have pity
for him, okay?

21:43.593 --> 21:45.512
Please, the kid works at
the Greek Theater all summer.

21:45.595 --> 21:46.888
Free tickets, he's a stagehand.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.558
You know stagehands?
They have groupies there.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.393
{\an3}If you want to have
pity on someone,

21:51.476 --> 21:52.769
have pity on me, okay?

21:52.853 --> 21:54.855
I busted my ass
in summer school,

21:54.938 --> 21:56.440
and I am still not a junior.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.692
Wait a minute. Val told me
Peach Pit After Dark's

21:58.775 --> 22:00.068
become one of the hottest
dance clubs in town.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.403
You got nothing to do with that?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.155
No, not a thing.
I'm a doormat there.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.364
It's just the way it is.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.366
I take 'em to the top
and they dump me.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.367
Just like Kelly.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.578
Anybody heard from her?

22:09.661 --> 22:10.912
Who wants to know?

22:10.996 --> 22:13.081
(laughs)

22:13.165 --> 22:13.957
How about Dylan? How's he?

22:14.041 --> 22:16.710
Oh, boy, you just don't stop,
do you?

22:16.793 --> 22:17.669
{\an1}Aw, come on,
give him a break.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.880
He had a rough summer,
world tour and all.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.132
Yeah, probably had a woman
in every port.

22:22.215 --> 22:25.635
{\an1}You know,
I really gotta travel more.

22:25.719 --> 22:32.934
♪ Let yourself go, accelerate. ♪

22:33.018 --> 22:34.436
Look, let's make this fast okay?

22:34.519 --> 22:35.729
The party at Donna's yacht
awaits.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.730
This is it?

22:36.813 --> 22:38.315
This is it.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.984
Silver, this is the nicest
building in the whole corridor.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.694
How good is this?

22:42.778 --> 22:46.073
Believe it or not fellas,
it's the penthouse apartment.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.992
Three bedrooms, three baths
with double spa tubs

22:49.076 --> 22:53.455
{\an3}and 24-hour maid service
for a nominal price.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.998
{\an1}(laughs)

22:55.082 --> 22:57.125
Just make sure I get
the biggest bedroom, okay?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.086
{\an3}Oh, sure. Remind me
to get my teeth cleaned.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.128
I get the biggest bedroom.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.633
{\an1}I tell you, my old man had
a way with a checkbook.

23:04.716 --> 23:05.801
Look at this.

23:05.884 --> 23:10.847
His bar tab for one month
at the Beach Club: three grand.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.974
{\an6}That's a lot
of martinis.
Yeah.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.267
{\an3}Did you find
anything else?

23:14.351 --> 23:18.647
His divorce agreement.
It's quite a read.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.316
{\an5}Iris got $6 million cash
to disappear.
Hmm.

23:21.399 --> 23:22.984
{\an1}It's all here
in black and white.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.154
{\an3}Well, at least
your dad wanted you.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.156
{\an3}My dad left
when I was two.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.493
What was wrong with him?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.703
He's still alive.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.498
Might as well be dead
as much as I see him.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.833
What's that?

23:37.916 --> 23:40.335
{\an1}It's...

23:40.418 --> 23:42.796
{\an1}it's Jack's notebook
from prison.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.841
{\an1}Keeping track
of all his pinochle games.

23:45.924 --> 23:49.719
His cellmate was into him
for quite a bit.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.805
Well, maybe you
should collect.

23:51.888 --> 23:54.850
Yeah, maybe I should.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.018
Hell, he probably knows
a lot about him

23:57.102 --> 23:58.019
sharing a five-by-nine room

23:58.103 --> 24:00.564
for two years.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.192
You still miss him, don't you?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.986
{\an1}Every day.

24:06.069 --> 24:10.365
Whoever took him away from me
is gonna pay for it.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.492
You're serious.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.162
I'm dead serious.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.835
Please be careful.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.503
No matter what is between us

24:23.587 --> 24:26.339
I couldn't bear it if
anything were to happen to you.

24:29.259 --> 24:30.927
Don't.

24:32.637 --> 24:36.600
{\an3}I told you there's
someone else.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.812
There's always
someone else.

24:42.814 --> 24:46.735
Dylan... we're over.

24:46.818 --> 24:50.197
You don't need me anymore.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.949
I'll always need you.

25:06.713 --> 25:09.758
(calypso music playing)

25:11.176 --> 25:13.428
I've gotta hand
it to you, Doc.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.180
{\an3}You put up one hell
of a challenge.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.933
Not bad for a bunch
of landlubbers, huh?

25:18.016 --> 25:19.476
Donna, you remember
Mr. and Mrs. Korman.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.019
Hi. Nice to
see you again.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.812
Well, Donna, you've
certainly grown up.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.608
Donna's going to celebrate her
21st birthday this Christmas.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.401
{\an1}And you don't look
a day over 19.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.154
{\an3}This is Donna's
boyfriend, Ray Pruit.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.447
Nice to meet you, sir.

25:32.530 --> 25:33.323
Call me Jerry, please.

25:33.406 --> 25:34.783
{\an1}I'm already old enough
to be your father.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.117
Don't make me feel worse.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.955
Oh, would, would you
excuse me for a minute?

25:44.876 --> 25:46.962
{\an1}Really, did you get a load
of that woman's jewelry?

25:47.045 --> 25:48.922
{\an1}What do you think
she wears to a formal.

25:49.005 --> 25:49.923
They're probably fake.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.425
{\an3}More importantly,
what are they doing here?

25:54.552 --> 25:56.972
{\an1}I... I don't know.
I didn't invite them.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.099
You know, normally I'd say
the more the merrier,

25:59.182 --> 26:00.809
but, with those two,
I'd rather jump overboard.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.727
Yeah, well, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

26:02.811 --> 26:03.979
So, don't say anything.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.522
I don't want to ruin
my mom's party okay?

26:05.605 --> 26:07.315
Okay.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.278
{\an1}Hey, guys.
Hey, ladies.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.487
Hey, ladies.

26:15.573 --> 26:16.533
Help yourselves.

26:16.616 --> 26:19.160
{\an1}Donna, I hope you don't mind
that we just showed up.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.704
Steve said you were
inviting everybody.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.330
{\an3}No, of course not.
It's fine.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.498
You have a beautiful boat.

26:23.581 --> 26:25.458
{\an1}Do you mind if we take
a look around?

26:25.542 --> 26:27.252
Be my guest.

26:33.591 --> 26:36.177
I love L.A.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.013
{\an1}Watch out.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.682
{\an1}You'll be turning back
into a pumpkin soon enough.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.226
Not necessarily.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.061
I could marry well.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.230
Well, then you better
forget about Brandon.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.482
{\an1}The one thing he
doesn't have is money.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.693
{\an3}He makes up for it
in other areas.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.487
Yeah, tell me about it.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.365
You're sure you don't mind
if I take my shot?

26:57.449 --> 26:58.867
I thought you already did.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.828
Yeah, but that was
just fooling around.

27:01.911 --> 27:05.874
Now it's time to get serious.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.835
(both laughing)

27:11.087 --> 27:12.422
To the high life.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.548
To 24-hour maid service.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.091
To double spa tubs.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.718
Ah!

27:16.801 --> 27:18.887
Brandon, you came!

27:18.970 --> 27:20.388
Hey, I wouldn't miss
your party for anything.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.514
Is Kelly here?

27:21.598 --> 27:22.849
Uh, no, she couldn't make it.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.351
{\an1}She's with Dylan.
It's not like that.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.019
It had something to
do with his father.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.312
Donna, it's okay.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.397
Right.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.900
Felice...

27:31.983 --> 27:33.443
Yeah.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.737
{\an4}May I talk to you
for a moment?
What's wrong?

27:35.820 --> 27:37.072
It seems I've
lost my ring.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.616
Are you sure?

27:39.699 --> 27:40.909
Yes, I was in the
downstairs bathroom.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.243
I took it off to
wash my hands--

27:42.327 --> 27:44.245
I left it right on the sink,
and now it's gone.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.955
Maybe you just dropped it.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.415
Donna, would you go down
and see if you can find it?

27:47.499 --> 27:48.375
Sure, what'd it look like?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.877
It was an emerald
and diamond cocktail ring.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.921
It's my anniversary
present from Jerry.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.757
What's going on?
Mrs. Korman left

27:55.840 --> 27:57.425
{\an1}her ring in the head.
Did you see it?

27:57.509 --> 28:00.595
No, I was just down there,
but I didn't see any ring.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.348
{\an3}Barbara, I'm sure
we're gonna find it.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.392
We better.

28:12.315 --> 28:14.442
Harris is on his way down.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.443
You know the drill?

28:15.527 --> 28:16.569
Yeah, I know the drill.

28:16.653 --> 28:20.073
{\an3}My old man was a "guest"
here for a couple of years.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.076
(door buzzing)

28:26.871 --> 28:30.125
Dylan McKay.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.793
{\an1}Never thought I'd
see you again.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.836
How you doing, Ben?

28:32.919 --> 28:33.837
{\an1}All right.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.171
I brought you some books.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.632
{\an3}You still like
Robert Ludlum, yeah?

28:37.715 --> 28:39.467
{\an1}That's quite a memory
you got there, kid.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.010
Thanks.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.637
How's your blood pressure?

28:42.720 --> 28:45.348
Through the roof.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.642
What else is new?

28:47.725 --> 28:51.271
{\an1}You didn't come here
to talk about my health.

28:51.354 --> 28:54.607
You know why I'm here.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.609
I can hazard a guess.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.403
So what do you know?

28:58.486 --> 29:01.865
Jack told me
to look out for you.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.493
Yeah, well, Jack's dead.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.245
You looking to meet
him in heaven?

29:07.328 --> 29:09.998
I'm looking to meet
the guy that put him there.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.332
You know who that is.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.668
Who doesn't?

29:13.751 --> 29:15.170
I don't.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.006
I wasn't willing to trade
my life for the information.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.300
Although I was given
the opportunity.

29:20.383 --> 29:24.262
Maybe it's best
if I don't tell you either.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.226
I read this one already.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.646
They all come out the same.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.525
{\an1}But in real life,
the good guys don't make it.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.111
Maybe this time they will.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.996
His name is Marchette.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.372
Anthony Marchette.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.124
Businessman.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.542
Very private.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.878
You'll never get to him.

29:56.961 --> 30:00.632
That's what they said
about Jack.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.554
Thanks for the books, kid.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.556
{\an1}Try not to get
yourself killed.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.059
Your daddy wouldn't like it.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.936
Time's up, man.

30:30.703 --> 30:34.582
That's right, we're
in Basin D, Slip 44.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.667
The yacht's name is <i> Felonna.</i>

30:35.750 --> 30:36.626
John, hang up.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.044
{\an1}I don't want
the police involved.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.796
Look, the Kormans can't
make an insurance claim

30:39.879 --> 30:41.923
unless we file a report.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.133
Maybe we better
get out of here

30:44.217 --> 30:46.636
{\an3}before they line us up
for a strip search.

30:46.719 --> 30:49.138
I don't know, I'd
stick around for that.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.270
I hate this boat.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.854
Mom, relax.

30:58.856 --> 31:01.609
Wasn't Ray in the bathroom
right after Mrs. Korman?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.778
A lot of people were
in the bathroom.

31:03.861 --> 31:04.946
I'm just saying...

31:05.029 --> 31:06.447
{\an3}I know what
you're saying, Mom.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.324
And I don't want
to hear it, okay?

31:24.882 --> 31:26.926
{\an3}Hey, did anybody ever find
the ring on the boat?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.304
{\an1}I talked to Donna
and nothing's turned up.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.305
How does this sound?

31:30.388 --> 31:31.681
"Dear Mom and Dad.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.474
{\an1}Send vast quantities
of money."

31:33.558 --> 31:36.811
It's too sensitive.
It's too sensitive.

31:36.894 --> 31:38.605
{\an1}I can't get right
to the point.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.981
Let me give it a try.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.691
All right.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.151
Hey, hey, hey, ow!

31:43.234 --> 31:45.153
Dear Mom and Dad.

31:45.236 --> 31:49.407
I have the major hots

31:49.490 --> 31:52.452
for your son.

31:52.535 --> 31:55.413
Love, Ginger.

31:59.208 --> 32:03.171
Whoa, whoa, you, uh...

32:03.254 --> 32:04.964
you just sent that.

32:05.048 --> 32:08.968
{\an4}Well, at least
now they'll know
you're not lonely.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.345
Help, Val.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.805
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.724
What's up,
ladies and germs.

32:14.807 --> 32:16.351
{\an1}Inside this box,
I have got the key

32:16.434 --> 32:19.604
{\an1}to make this the party
to end all parties.

32:19.687 --> 32:21.189
Check it out.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.819
Steve?

32:34.285 --> 32:35.370
Steve, what're you doing?

32:35.453 --> 32:37.413
Tagging the wall.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.207
Are you feeling okay?

32:39.290 --> 32:40.541
Yeah, I'm feeling fine.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.210
Come on, they're gonna
knock this house down.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.212
Give me that!

32:44.295 --> 32:46.214
All right, but think
of all the destruction

32:46.297 --> 32:48.132
we could do here
without any consequences.

32:50.968 --> 32:52.845
{\an3}It could be
rather liberating.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.389
Go for it.

32:55.431 --> 32:58.267
{\an3}Steve... (chuckles)
I can't.

32:58.351 --> 32:59.852
This is my house.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.105
Brandon, come on, this house

33:02.188 --> 33:04.232
is going to be a pile
of rubble pretty soon.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.402
{\an1}What are you going to do
when the bulldozer comes, cry?

33:07.485 --> 33:08.569
Hmm? Hmm?

33:08.653 --> 33:10.780
I will not.

33:10.863 --> 33:13.074
(laughing)

33:14.992 --> 33:17.036
Good, good, not Picasso,
but not bad.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.413
Val, I need your help.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.872
I'm gonna go on a beer run.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.416
{\an1}I need those strong
arms of yours.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.000
{\an3}Why do I have to do
everything around here?

33:23.084 --> 33:25.253
{\an1}Oh, stop complaining, will ya?
It's for a good cause.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.338
{\an3}Besides, your fake I.D.'s
better than mine.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.426
Let me try that.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.109
What do you think?

33:48.192 --> 33:50.278
I wouldn't have pegged
you for a romantic.

33:50.361 --> 33:53.114
I am full of surprises.

33:53.197 --> 33:56.659
I bet you are. Good nighty.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.995
Hey, hey.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.456
{\an5}(knocking)
CLARE:
<i>D?</i>

34:01.539 --> 34:02.790
Yeah.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.667
Hurry up. Ray's here,
and Kelly just called.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.127
{\an3}She's meeting us
at Brandon's, okay?

34:06.210 --> 34:07.628
Is Colin coming?

34:07.712 --> 34:09.630
{\an3}No. He has to unpack
or something.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.757
RAY:
Donna, get a move on.

34:11.841 --> 34:12.800
I'll be right there.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.469
{\an3}Come on!

34:22.185 --> 34:25.313
So, what do you think?

34:25.396 --> 34:26.938
You look beautiful.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.149
You always look beautiful.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.275
Thank you.

34:29.358 --> 34:30.902
Clare will be right out.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.987
So, that gives you a few seconds
to mess up my lipstick.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.326
Was it just me,
or was your mother

34:38.409 --> 34:39.619
giving me the evil eye today?

34:39.702 --> 34:41.036
What are you talking about?

34:41.120 --> 34:44.665
She thinks I stole
that ring, doesn't she?

34:44.748 --> 34:47.960
No, no, she doesn't.

34:48.043 --> 34:51.130
{\an3}Come on, let's just go
and have fun tonight, okay?

34:54.425 --> 34:56.135
Hey! Stop that.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.845
We've got
a party to go to.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.806
And you have lipstick
all over your face.

34:59.889 --> 35:00.890
I'm ready to go.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.391
I like it.
Cool.

35:06.270 --> 35:10.274
{\an6}So this Dylan,
is he over you?
No.

35:10.358 --> 35:13.861
If you want him to leave you
alone, why did you go with him?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.780
{\an1}Well, when his
father was killed,

35:15.863 --> 35:17.824
{\an1}I wasn't really
much help to him.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.660
I guess I feel sort
of bad about that.

35:20.743 --> 35:23.037
{\an3}So now you've done
your part and you're free.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.747
Yeah.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.999
Let me ask you something.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.209
Do you like your father?

35:28.292 --> 35:29.710
Where'd that come from?

35:29.794 --> 35:32.129
I just want to know more
about you, that's all.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.132
Yeah, my dad's great.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.677
He coached Little League,
raised five kids,

35:37.760 --> 35:40.680
put me
through art school.

35:40.763 --> 35:43.891
But he works for an
insurance company.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.768
He still wants to know
what I do for a living.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.521
What do you do for a living?

35:48.604 --> 35:49.939
Come here.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.409
Smell this.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.620
It's the scent
of creativity.

36:04.704 --> 36:07.373
Better than food,
better than sex.

36:07.456 --> 36:08.541
Better than me?

36:08.624 --> 36:10.585
Well, there's always
room for improvement.

36:13.462 --> 36:14.255
{\an1}You look good
in Burnt Sienna.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.298
You are crazy.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.717
Why...

36:17.800 --> 36:18.926
Do I look crazy?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.636
Well, there's always

36:20.720 --> 36:22.847
room for improvement.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.900
(loud music playing)

36:58.215 --> 37:00.635
(knocking on door)

37:00.718 --> 37:02.970
It's open.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.305
Hi.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.640
Hi.

37:05.723 --> 37:06.974
Help me with my zipper?

37:07.058 --> 37:09.143
Up or down?

37:09.226 --> 37:10.603
What would you prefer?

37:12.063 --> 37:14.148
Turn around.

37:14.231 --> 37:16.317
You're such a good boy.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.986
{\an1}Wouldn't want to be
late to my own party.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.239
You'd be <i> very</i> late.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.202
{\an3}Brandon!

37:26.285 --> 37:28.537
{\an3}Brandon,
where are you?

37:30.748 --> 37:32.083
{\an3}Hi, Kel.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.668
Hey! I hate you!

37:33.751 --> 37:34.835
You didn't call
me all summer.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.504
{\an3}Yeah. I hate
you, too.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.339
{\an1}So how was New York?
You look great.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.841
{\an3}Thanks. It was everything
I thought it would be.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.718
So are you the world's
greatest reporter yet?

37:42.802 --> 37:44.178
{\an1}Well, I don't
know about all that,

37:44.261 --> 37:45.346
but they did invite
me back next year.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.056
{\an3}Good. I want to
hear all about it.

37:47.139 --> 37:47.974
Well, hang on a sec.

37:48.057 --> 37:50.309
{\an1}Kel, this is Ginger.
Ginger, this is Kelly.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.019
I'm a friend of Valerie's

37:52.103 --> 37:53.729
from Buffalo.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.690
{\an3}Oh. Well, any friend
of Valerie's....

37:55.773 --> 37:58.776
Care to finish that sentence?

37:58.859 --> 38:04.490
{\an3}No. Brandon, I'll
see you downstairs.

38:04.573 --> 38:07.326
Is there a window open in here?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.870
I think I just felt
a cold wind blow through.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.163
I think you're right.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.498
{\an3}It did get a little
chilly in here.

38:12.581 --> 38:16.877
Well, I know how
to warm things up.

38:16.961 --> 38:20.214
Oh, you do?

38:20.297 --> 38:22.174
Oh.

38:22.258 --> 38:25.594
That's a little better.

38:27.763 --> 38:30.349
Excuse me.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.477
Hey, there's five more
of these in the car,

38:33.561 --> 38:35.021
and lots of other goodies.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.148
You know,
if I didn't bring the food,

38:37.231 --> 38:38.858
you guys would never
invite me to anything.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.610
Oh, Nat, we love you!

38:41.694 --> 38:43.738
And we emptied the fridge,
so there's plenty of room.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.906
{\an3}Good. 'Cause you're
going to need it.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.116
Hey, Nat!

38:47.199 --> 38:48.284
Hi, Kel.

38:48.367 --> 38:49.660
Welcome home.

38:49.744 --> 38:50.953
Thank you.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.955
{\an3}I didn't realize
you were back.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.540
Sorry to disappoint you.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.333
So, have you
seen Brandon?

38:56.417 --> 38:57.585
Oh, yes.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.128
How about Dylan?

38:59.211 --> 39:03.090
I can see you haven't changed
this summer, Valerie.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.800
Meaning?

39:04.884 --> 39:06.344
Meaning I have.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.928
The gloves are off. Watch out.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.764
Ooh! I'm quaking.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.432
Good. I'm not playing anymore.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.100
Not with you, anyway.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.311
{\an1}Everything under
control down here?

39:15.394 --> 39:17.688
{\an3}Yeah. It's a party
and a half.

39:28.532 --> 39:31.577
♪ ♪

39:42.046 --> 39:46.050
(yelling and laughing)

39:57.061 --> 39:59.146
Hey, not bad for
last-minute, huh?

39:59.230 --> 40:00.314
You try anything like
this in our new house,

40:00.397 --> 40:01.649
I will kill you.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.402
This is post-impressionist
love shack, man!

40:07.321 --> 40:09.782
{\an6}Donna, you're wearing
the necklace I got
you in New York.

40:09.865 --> 40:10.741
How does it look?

40:10.825 --> 40:12.493
{\an3}It looks beautiful.
I'm glad you like it.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.619
You didn't bring me
any jewelry, Kel.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.788
You know, I saw some perfect
little dangly earrings

40:15.871 --> 40:16.789
you would have loved.

40:16.872 --> 40:18.207
{\an3}Next time.

40:18.290 --> 40:20.042
I can't believe this.
I know.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.335
If Jim and Cindy
could see this place now,

40:21.418 --> 40:22.962
they would flip out.

40:23.045 --> 40:25.131
I never thought Brandon
would get this wild.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.341
I guarantee Steve had something
to do with it.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.805
Hey, stranger. Hey!

40:32.888 --> 40:34.140
How's the jet-setter?

40:34.223 --> 40:35.391
It's good to be home.

40:35.474 --> 40:36.851
Well, I missed you.

40:36.934 --> 40:39.019
Yeah. I'll bet. Some party.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.021
Yeah. Just a few hundred
of our closest lunatics.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.648
Is Kelly here yet?

40:42.731 --> 40:45.818
You'll never learn, will you?

40:47.903 --> 40:49.905
Learn what?

40:56.120 --> 40:58.205
{\an3}Hi.
Hi.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.707
Did you get what you wanted?

40:59.790 --> 41:02.001
Yeah.
Good.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.711
I'm happy for you.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.838
Are you?
I guess.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.175
{\an3}Hey, there,
Mr. World Traveler.

41:09.258 --> 41:11.385
What's happening?

41:11.469 --> 41:13.888
How you doing,
Mr. Boston Strangler?

41:13.971 --> 41:15.556
I'll let you two catch up.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.558
I'm going to dance.

41:17.641 --> 41:20.561
{\an3}So, I heard you spent
the day with her today.

41:20.644 --> 41:21.562
How did it go?

41:21.645 --> 41:24.231
{\an3}Oh, you know how she is--
barrel of laughs.

41:25.524 --> 41:28.194
{\an3}Hey, Brand, you know a
guy named Tony Marchette?

41:28.277 --> 41:31.864
Yeah, sure. Casinos.

41:31.947 --> 41:34.408
{\an1}Big business.
Land development.

41:34.491 --> 41:36.368
Murder.

41:36.452 --> 41:38.370
{\an1}What are you
talking about?

41:38.454 --> 41:41.248
I'm talking about...
he's the guy.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.083
He's the guy that killed my dad.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.044
{\an3}Nobody seems to
want to do anything

41:45.127 --> 41:47.087
{\an3}much about it,
though, except me.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.589
And you're involving Kelly
in this?

41:48.672 --> 41:50.049
I tried.

41:50.132 --> 41:51.425
She didn't want to play, so...

41:51.509 --> 41:54.053
It's okay.
I'd rather drag you in anyway.

41:55.971 --> 41:57.723
Sure.

41:57.806 --> 42:00.643
Why should I let you
have all the fun?

42:10.527 --> 42:11.737
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.572
I was way out of line.

42:13.656 --> 42:16.492
I'll clean that up for you.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.079
{\an3}Sorry.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.497
It's okay.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.963
{\an1}You know,
for the first time,

42:29.046 --> 42:30.422
I feel like
your friends

42:30.506 --> 42:32.299
{\an1}actually don't mind
having me around.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.093
Are you kidding?

42:34.176 --> 42:36.011
They like you as much as I do.

42:36.095 --> 42:38.180
Well, maybe not as much as I do.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.231
Dylan, are you leaving?

42:47.314 --> 42:48.816
Yeah. I gotta get out of here.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.485
I'm worried about you.

42:51.568 --> 42:52.820
Don't be.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.165
Come on, Brandon.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.293
Take me upstairs.

43:07.376 --> 43:08.669
You sure about that?

43:08.752 --> 43:10.462
Are you kidding?

43:14.633 --> 43:15.843
Come on. Let's go.

43:17.136 --> 43:19.054
{\an1}Uh...

43:19.138 --> 43:22.182
{\an1}You know, Ginger, there's
something you need to know.

43:23.976 --> 43:28.230
{\an3}I know everything
I need to know.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.649
{\an3}She broke up with
you, remember?

43:34.611 --> 43:37.364
{\an1}Come on.
Let's... let's mingle.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.325
Party pooper.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.373
That's my man.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.875
{\an1}I'm taking off,
Brandon.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.752
What for, Nat?
Party's just getting started.

43:49.835 --> 43:51.003
Well, enjoy yourself.

43:51.086 --> 43:52.546
I can't take any more.

43:52.629 --> 43:54.923
What are you talking about?

43:55.007 --> 43:57.718
{\an1}Uh... Would you excuse us
for a second, please?

43:57.801 --> 43:59.303
Excuse us.

44:01.805 --> 44:03.349
What's happened to you?

44:03.432 --> 44:05.392
What are you guys doing
to this house?

44:05.476 --> 44:06.727
It's disgusting.

44:06.810 --> 44:07.770
It's a disgrace.
Nat, the people

44:07.853 --> 44:09.938
who bought this house
are going to tear it down.

44:10.022 --> 44:12.900
That doesn't make it right,
Brandon.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.152
This was your home.

44:22.618 --> 44:26.330
Who died and made him
third grade teacher?

44:37.883 --> 44:40.094
{\an1}Candace, what
are you doing here?

44:40.177 --> 44:43.931
{\an3}Oh, Valerie, uh, I
tried to call and call.

44:44.014 --> 44:46.600
{\an3}The phone just rang
all the time.

44:46.683 --> 44:48.769
No wonder. You probably
couldn't even hear it.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.938
What?

44:51.021 --> 44:53.315
Where's Brandon?

44:53.399 --> 44:55.484
Oh, in there somewhere.

44:58.821 --> 45:00.906
Brandon.

45:00.989 --> 45:03.075
{\an1}Candace!
You party animal, you.

45:03.158 --> 45:05.077
I need to talk to you,
Brandon.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.412
Can we go someplace quiet?

45:06.495 --> 45:08.956
There isn't anyplace quiet.
Talk here.

45:09.039 --> 45:12.501
Brandon,
the house fell out of escrow.

45:12.584 --> 45:15.712
{\an1}I'm sorry.
I didn't hear that.

45:15.796 --> 45:19.174
I said the house
fell out of escrow!

45:19.258 --> 45:20.759
What?

45:20.843 --> 45:23.721
The house fell out of escrow!

45:23.804 --> 45:27.599
It's all yours!

45:27.683 --> 45:28.976
I'll talk to you tomorrow,

45:29.059 --> 45:30.644
{\an3}sweetheart.

45:32.187 --> 45:33.939
Yeah. Yeah.

45:34.022 --> 45:36.859
(glass breaking)

45:40.070 --> 45:41.613
{\an1}What are you
worried about, man?

45:41.697 --> 45:44.825
{\an1}We're moving into a place
that's got double spa tubs.

45:44.908 --> 45:46.160
Steve, will you
shut up already?

45:46.243 --> 45:48.996
{\an5}I've got more things
to worry about than
bathrooms, all right?

45:49.079 --> 45:50.205
What if Big Jim saw this house?

45:50.289 --> 45:51.540
He'd have a heart attack.

45:51.623 --> 45:52.875
{\an3}Well, we just won't
tell your folks,

45:52.958 --> 45:54.126
{\an3}and we'll just
fix the place up.

45:54.209 --> 45:56.170
Valerie, Muntz was swinging
from the dining room chandelier.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.796
And it's not there anymore.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.715
Great, great, great.

45:59.798 --> 46:01.216
{\an1}Someone please
stop the bombing.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.050
Don't worry, man.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.343
{\an3}I have the ultimate
set of tools.

46:03.427 --> 46:06.013
It's going to take a lot more
than tools to fix up this place.

46:06.096 --> 46:07.681
{\an1}It's nothing
money can't fix.

46:07.764 --> 46:09.475
{\an3}Your money,
thank you very much.

46:09.558 --> 46:10.476
{\an1}Big deal.

46:10.559 --> 46:11.810
Look, Brandon,
we'll all help.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.145
{\an1}We'll put everything back
the way it was, okay?

46:13.228 --> 46:15.689
Is she always
so cheerful?

46:15.772 --> 46:17.065
{\an1}You know what
my dad always says.

46:17.149 --> 46:20.194
{\an1}You make your bed,
you gotta sleep in it.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.404
Just don't sleep in it alone.

46:24.281 --> 46:26.200
{\an1}Can I borrow your jacket?
I'm cold.

46:26.283 --> 46:27.576
Sure.
Thank you.

46:27.659 --> 46:29.036
{\an5}I'm going to go
get another cold
one. Any takers?

46:29.119 --> 46:29.870
Coffee, please.

46:29.953 --> 46:31.538
Yeah. Me too, man. Please.

46:41.215 --> 46:43.008
Oh, no.

46:43.091 --> 46:44.218
What's wrong?

46:44.301 --> 46:46.720
It's Barbara Korman's ring.

46:46.803 --> 46:47.846
The one she lost on the boat.

46:49.097 --> 46:50.182
{\an3}Great.

46:50.265 --> 46:51.558
Ray's got a new career.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.060
{\an3}Hold on.

46:53.143 --> 46:55.187
You don't know he took it.

46:58.315 --> 46:59.942
What's going on?

47:00.025 --> 47:01.401
You tell us.

47:02.986 --> 47:05.739
I... I found this
in your pocket.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.661
{\an1}Care to explain
how it got there?

47:15.290 --> 47:16.875
Come on, Ray.
Just tell us the truth.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.752
Did you steal the ring?

47:18.835 --> 47:20.087
{\an3}No, I didn't
steal any ring.

47:20.170 --> 47:22.923
I believe you.

47:23.006 --> 47:23.840
You hear what he said?

47:23.924 --> 47:26.134
{\an1}He said he didn't take it,
he didn't take it.

47:26.218 --> 47:27.928
{\an3}Hey, don't
mock me, Sanders.

47:28.011 --> 47:29.263
Hey, man!

47:29.346 --> 47:31.640
{\an3}You're a jerk, Sanders.
You're all jerks.

47:31.723 --> 47:33.433
{\an3}All right?
Yeah, I took the ring

47:33.517 --> 47:35.310
and I put it in my pocket
so you guys would find it.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.770
Smart thief, huh?

47:36.853 --> 47:38.438
{\an1}What are we supposed
to think, Ray?

47:38.522 --> 47:39.481
I don't know, Val.

47:39.565 --> 47:40.732
I don't really care.

47:40.816 --> 47:42.067
{\an3}You can think whatever
the hell you want.

47:42.150 --> 47:43.694
I'm out of here.

47:43.777 --> 47:44.820
{\an3}I've had enough
of this.

47:44.903 --> 47:46.029
Easy, man.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.414
(door closes)

47:57.249 --> 47:59.585
Well, on that cheery note...

47:59.668 --> 48:02.296
Party's over,
ladies and gentlemen!

48:02.379 --> 48:04.298
{\an1}Let's go!

48:18.186 --> 48:20.063
You want some coffee?

48:20.147 --> 48:21.815
{\an1}Thanks.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.694
Look at this place.

48:25.777 --> 48:27.863
{\an1}I can't believe
I let this happen.

48:27.946 --> 48:30.824
Don't beat yourself up, Brandon.
It's not your fault.

48:30.907 --> 48:32.534
Of course it's my fault.

48:32.618 --> 48:33.827
{\an1}This house is
my responsibility.

48:33.910 --> 48:35.454
You thought they were going
to tear it down.

48:35.537 --> 48:40.208
And that's supposed to be excuse
enough to behave like animals?

48:40.292 --> 48:42.628
I'm going to bed.

48:42.711 --> 48:45.839
I got a lot of work to do later.

48:45.922 --> 48:47.382
Everybody said they'd pitch in.

48:47.466 --> 48:50.510
Yeah.

48:50.594 --> 48:54.389
Think I could talk Jim and Cindy
into not selling this place.

48:54.473 --> 48:56.141
Letting me stay here?

48:56.224 --> 48:58.560
Why would you want to?

48:58.644 --> 49:00.937
Because this is my home.

49:02.522 --> 49:05.317
I love this house.

49:05.400 --> 49:06.985
I'm not going anywhere.
