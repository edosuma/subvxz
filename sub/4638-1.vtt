00:21.930 --> 00:25.558
Tommy, hurry up!
You're gonna be late for school again.

00:46.705 --> 00:48.122
Son of a...

01:05.099 --> 01:06.224
Damn!

01:23.242 --> 01:24.534
Nice doggy.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.288
Holy schnikes!

01:35.462 --> 01:37.046
Late again, Tommy?

01:37.131 --> 01:39.382
- You're pathetic.
- Shut up, Richard.

01:40.134 --> 01:43.469
- Come on, Tommy!
- Hurry up.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.441
Damn!

02:27.264 --> 02:28.890
Hi. How are you?

02:48.076 --> 02:49.535
Oh, man!

02:49.620 --> 02:52.413
No! Please, God, no!

02:53.290 --> 02:54.707
Son of a...

03:38.418 --> 03:40.461
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Hey, I got an A.

03:40.546 --> 03:43.130
Sorry. Pardon me.
Can I just check this out?

03:44.591 --> 03:45.925
"D+"?

03:46.093 --> 03:48.344
Oh, my God.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.680
I passed!

03:51.098 --> 03:52.431
I passed.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.935
Man! I got a D+.

03:56.436 --> 04:00.773
I'm gonna graduate!
I wish we'd known each other.

04:00.858 --> 04:02.400
This is a little awkward.

04:02.484 --> 04:06.112
I'm gonna graduate! Give me five!

04:08.448 --> 04:09.782
I'm gonna graduate!

04:13.120 --> 04:14.620
Wombat!

04:16.790 --> 04:19.916
Guys, do I look different
now that I'm a college grad?

04:20.627 --> 04:22.003
Not really.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.591
Apparently, they give a lot fewer
D pluses than D minuses.

04:26.675 --> 04:29.594
It's not a grade they like to give out,
I'll tell you that right now.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.055
- Yeah. You mentioned that.
- So that's it for school, huh? Now what?

04:33.140 --> 04:34.473
No idea.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.642
But for now I'll probably go back

04:36.727 --> 04:39.020
and work at my dad's
loading dock like always.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.063
Then after that, figure it out.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.816
I'm gonna miss you, man.
You were the best.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.279
You were the best. I love all you guys.

04:49.907 --> 04:51.490
Especially you.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.622
I'm gonna make a toast.

04:57.706 --> 05:00.249
To the best bunch of rugby freaks
ever born.

05:00.334 --> 05:03.127
Maybe we weren't the smartest guys
on campus.

05:03.211 --> 05:06.505
Maybe we spent a little too much time
puking off balconies.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.090
But we had fun, huh?

05:08.175 --> 05:09.592
Yeah!

05:13.680 --> 05:16.557
Now some of us are leaving
and that is sad.

05:16.642 --> 05:18.601
But this isn't the end. No way.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.270
We're gonna show this world
a thing or two.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.147
We're gonna show...

05:39.081 --> 05:41.207
- Richard Hayden?
- Tommy.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.377
So where's my dad? I thought
he was gonna meet me at the airport.

05:44.461 --> 05:47.463
He was at the airport this morning,
but you weren't on the plane.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.090
He said he had a surprise for me.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.133
Maybe. I guess you should've called.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.636
I did call earlier when

05:53.887 --> 05:54.929
using the phone.

05:55.013 --> 05:58.683
- Earlier, when was that?
- Or later. When...

05:58.767 --> 06:00.726
Then I left a message.

06:00.811 --> 06:02.853
A message? What number did you call?

06:03.271 --> 06:05.982
Two, four, niner,

06:06.066 --> 06:07.817
five, six, seven, eight...

06:07.901 --> 06:09.610
I can't hear you. You're trailing off.

06:09.695 --> 06:13.030
And did I catch a "niner" in there?
Were you calling from a walkie-talkie?

06:13.115 --> 06:15.866
- No, it was cordless.
- You know what? Don't.

06:15.951 --> 06:17.618
Not here, not now.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.745
Did you hear I finally graduated?

06:19.830 --> 06:22.498
Yeah. In just a shade
under a decade, too. All right.

06:22.582 --> 06:25.251
You know, a lot of people
go to college for seven years.

06:25.335 --> 06:27.545
I know. They're called doctors.

06:27.629 --> 06:29.422
That has to be you.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.260
Spray that thing for bugs?

06:57.701 --> 07:01.328
- What happened to the tire plant?
- Shut it down last month.

07:01.413 --> 07:04.582
Would you mind not eating in the car?
It's kind of a rule.

07:04.666 --> 07:06.876
- Still got your GTX car, huh?
- Yep.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.670
And I dropped in a 440 Magnum
with a six-pack.

07:09.755 --> 07:11.714
You hang on to a car this cherry

07:11.798 --> 07:15.468
- kind of like your suitcase.
- "Kind of like your suitcase."

07:15.552 --> 07:17.762
What's new with the old gang
from high school?

07:17.846 --> 07:21.015
I don't know, Tommy. I didn't really like
the old gang from high school.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.060
- Hey, the muffler plant's gone, too.
- Yep.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.352
Man!

07:26.480 --> 07:28.147
Come on! Damn it!

07:29.357 --> 07:30.858
That sounds good.

07:30.942 --> 07:34.320
Melted chocolate inside the dash.
That really ups the resale value.

07:34.738 --> 07:38.616
I think you're gonna be okay here.
They have a thin candy shell.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.326
I'm surprised you didn't know that.

07:40.410 --> 07:42.745
I think your brain
has a thick candy shell.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.998
Your... Your brain has the shell on it.

07:46.541 --> 07:49.043
- Are you talking?
- Shut up, Richard.

08:00.597 --> 08:04.058
Ron, don't tell me the bank thinks
we need to wait it out.

08:04.142 --> 08:07.228
Any business that tries to wait it out
will be just that, out.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.980
In auto parts you're either growing
or you're dying.

08:10.065 --> 08:11.440
There ain't no third direction.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.110
Tom, you're talking about a huge loan.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.695
Maybe instead of borrowing
you should take on a partner.

08:16.780 --> 08:20.449
No, this always has been,
always will be a family firm.

08:21.409 --> 08:22.952
My grandfather founded it in '21.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.497
My father kept it running during
the Depression. My aunt Aileen ran it

08:26.581 --> 08:29.208
when he went away to war
and someday my son will run it.

08:29.292 --> 08:31.669
- Hi, Dad.
- Tommy!

08:39.885 --> 08:43.889
Damn, I'm proud of you. Mr. Big Time.
College grad.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.058
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

08:46.143 --> 08:47.893
You're looking great, kid.

08:47.978 --> 08:50.312
Thanks, Mr. Rittenhauer.
How you doing, Mr. Reilly?

08:50.397 --> 08:53.357
Real good.
I had a kidney removed last April

08:53.441 --> 08:55.151
but I still have the other one.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.153
Yeah, you remember Mr. Gilmore
from the bank.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.155
- Yeah. Nice to see you again, sir.
- How are you?

08:59.239 --> 09:00.865
Why don't you come out on the floor
with us?

09:00.949 --> 09:03.492
Gilmore needs reminding
of why he does business with us.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.162
- Richard, could you...
- Run these figures by accounting.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.288
No problem.

09:07.372 --> 09:10.249
My fellow nerds and I will retire
to the nerdery with our calculators.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.501
- Come on.
- We should have something for you

09:12.586 --> 09:14.128
by this afternoon.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.213
Hard hats, gentlemen.

09:16.298 --> 09:18.716
You get hit in the head
without wearing one of these

09:18.800 --> 09:21.385
they scoop your brains out
with a goddamn soup ladle.

09:24.723 --> 09:26.932
Look alive! Low bridge!

09:29.102 --> 09:30.394
Son of a...

09:31.479 --> 09:33.189
- You all right, Tommy?
- Yeah.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.232
- What happened?
- Nothing.

09:35.317 --> 09:37.234
Danny. How's that new son-in-law?

09:37.319 --> 09:39.028
He's a real pain in the butt.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.198
Tommy, you're back!
Way to go on that D+.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.783
Thanks, Danny. Looking good, man.

09:49.831 --> 09:52.124
- Hey, Tommy!
- Hey, man. How you doing?

09:52.209 --> 09:53.667
How are you?

09:53.752 --> 09:55.794
Good to see you. How you doing?

09:55.879 --> 09:58.047
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey, Tommy.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.758
- Welcome home, buddy.
- Tommy, welcome back.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.385
Hang in there, Ron. We're almost there.

10:03.470 --> 10:06.388
Lou, I got some papers
I want you to sign in the office.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.057
- Hey, Louis.
- Hey, Tommy!

10:08.141 --> 10:09.558
What are you doing on the floor?

10:09.643 --> 10:12.603
I was going crazy on the loading docks,
so your dad moved me in here.

10:12.687 --> 10:14.396
- What is this thing?
- It's a buffer.

10:14.481 --> 10:17.441
I take oil filters that need smoothing
and give them a quick zap.

10:17.525 --> 10:18.651
Cool.

10:18.902 --> 10:21.153
- Can I try one?
- Help yourself.

10:28.578 --> 10:29.954
Nice distance.

10:30.038 --> 10:31.664
Tommy! Come on! Let's go!

10:31.748 --> 10:33.457
Yes, sir! See you.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.544
There she is, Ron, my dream.

10:37.629 --> 10:41.090
This, my friend,
is our new brake-pad division

10:41.174 --> 10:43.592
and the future of Callahan Auto.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.470
- Quite a sight, Tom.
- This is awesome.

10:46.554 --> 10:49.348
You say these brake pads
are gonna revolutionize the industry?

10:49.432 --> 10:51.350
Composed of high-grade steel
and graphite.

10:51.434 --> 10:54.144
They're the goddamn Rolls-Royce
of brake pads, that's what they are.

10:54.229 --> 10:56.730
I get tears in my eyes
just thinking about it.

11:02.570 --> 11:04.613
You're coming awful fast.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.324
- How you doing?
- I need fresh capital for material

11:07.409 --> 11:10.286
for a new work force,
before I can turn these machines on.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.455
Look out.
I've got catlike speed and reflexes.

11:14.457 --> 11:16.709
Now, in 23 years,
have I ever said no to you?

11:16.793 --> 11:20.546
Why say no when it feels so good
to say yes?

11:30.348 --> 11:32.141
I was checking

11:32.434 --> 11:35.561
the specs on the end line
for the rotary girder.

11:35.979 --> 11:37.438
I'm retarded.

11:37.689 --> 11:40.024
- Okay, Tom. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

11:44.779 --> 11:46.113
Okay, left.

11:47.115 --> 11:48.824
Can I open my eyes now, Dad?

11:48.908 --> 11:51.660
I told you, you didn't have to close them
in the first place.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.203
Here, go ahead. Open them up.

11:54.622 --> 11:55.664
That's my name!

11:55.749 --> 11:58.167
That's your new office now,
college grad.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.585
Go on in there!

12:00.170 --> 12:03.505
Awesome. Hey, there's even a fridge.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.759
This is great.
You could put six-packs of

12:07.385 --> 12:10.220
soda in here. Milk, yogurt.

12:10.305 --> 12:12.514
You could put candy bars in the freezer.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.475
Anything that you want to keep cool.

12:14.559 --> 12:15.601
Mr. Callahan,

12:15.685 --> 12:17.436
I need your John Hancock
on these reports.

12:17.520 --> 12:21.106
John Hancock. It's Herbie Hancock.

12:22.734 --> 12:25.194
Richard, check out my new office.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.695
You have a window.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.823
And why shouldn't you?
You've been here ten minutes.

12:29.908 --> 12:31.533
Now look, Son,
these are our new catalogs.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.369
Get to know them. They're important.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.830
Richard, I want you to promise me
you'll look after Tommy Boy here

12:36.915 --> 12:38.332
till he gets his feet wet.

12:38.416 --> 12:40.834
Sure. And thanks for choosing me.

12:41.211 --> 12:43.712
Now don't forget,
we're going home early today.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.839
- I got another surprise for you.
- Cool.

12:45.924 --> 12:47.174
Thanks, Dad.

12:50.595 --> 12:53.263
It's called reading.
Top to bottom, left to right.

12:53.348 --> 12:56.683
Group of words together is a sentence.
Take Tylenol for any headaches.

12:56.768 --> 12:58.727
Midol for any cramps.

12:58.812 --> 12:59.853
Shut up.

13:37.559 --> 13:39.059
Can I open my eyes now, Dad?

13:39.144 --> 13:42.187
For God's sake, Son,
will you quit covering your damn eyes?

13:42.439 --> 13:44.690
Holy schnikes.

13:52.949 --> 13:56.034
- Is that for me?
- No, Son, that's for me.

13:56.953 --> 13:58.328
Oh, man!

13:58.705 --> 14:00.956
Dad, she's like a 10.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.125
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

14:03.877 --> 14:07.129
- Hi.
- This must be Tommy. Are you Tommy?

14:07.213 --> 14:10.924
- I'm Tommy.
- I'm Beverly and you are just adorable.

14:13.261 --> 14:16.346
Son, I got an announcement to make.

14:17.098 --> 14:20.517
Tom, I've asked Beverly to be my wife.

14:22.812 --> 14:24.104
Man!

14:28.443 --> 14:29.985
What'd she say?

14:31.529 --> 14:33.989
It's so cool that
you're getting married Saturday.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.825
- So where'd you guys meet?
- Here you go, sweetie.

14:36.910 --> 14:41.497
We met at that fat farm spa resort thing.
Beverly was one of the trainers.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.000
In fact, she was the only one
of the trainers I didn't want to plant

14:45.084 --> 14:47.085
six feet under a lettuce patch.

14:47.337 --> 14:49.546
Wait till you hear this, Tommy.

14:49.631 --> 14:52.174
She's got a son.
He worked at the spa, too.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.675
I met him. He's a terrific guy.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.678
You're really gonna like him.
He's coming here today for the wedding.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.972
Tommy, it sounds funny saying this

14:59.057 --> 15:01.892
but my son is going to be
your new brother.

15:01.976 --> 15:04.603
Brother? I'm gonna have a brother?

15:05.188 --> 15:08.106
I've always dreamed
about having a brother.

15:08.983 --> 15:11.693
- Speak of the devil.
- A brother!

15:15.281 --> 15:17.115
- Brother?
- I'm Paul.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.911
- You must be Tommy.
- Brothers don't shake hands.

15:20.995 --> 15:22.955
Brothers gotta hug.

15:36.886 --> 15:39.054
I can't believe
I have a whole new family.

15:39.138 --> 15:40.681
This is awesome.

15:40.765 --> 15:43.100
- Yeah. Great.
- No offense

15:43.184 --> 15:46.562
but if I sent a picture of your mom
to some of my buddies at school

15:46.646 --> 15:49.439
she'd definitely be Boner of the Month.

15:51.109 --> 15:52.401
I'm honored.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.404
So is there anything to do
in this town besides eat?

15:55.488 --> 15:58.240
Tons of stuff. Late night pitch 'n' putt.

15:58.324 --> 16:01.368
We could go to the livestock auction
and cruise the Four-H babes.

16:01.452 --> 16:04.371
Throw stuff off the bridge.
What do you feel like doing?

16:04.455 --> 16:07.124
I don't know.
Something a little more dangerous.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.168
Sure. All you can handle, bro.

16:22.557 --> 16:24.141
Look at them there.

16:24.225 --> 16:28.103
Pretty maids all in a row.
I want the one on the left.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.814
She's perfect. Which one you want?

16:35.028 --> 16:36.194
Okay.

16:36.904 --> 16:39.448
- Does it make a difference?
- Oh, yeah.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.284
Wait a second. Is this your first time?

16:42.368 --> 16:44.077
Yeah, Tommy, it is.

16:44.162 --> 16:47.789
God, you're gonna remember this
the rest of your life.

16:47.874 --> 16:52.419
I can't believe you've never been
cow-tipping before. Get ready to live.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.381
She's sleeping.

16:56.466 --> 17:00.177
What you do is you put your shoulder
into her and you push.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.472
- And?
- They fall over.

17:05.974 --> 17:08.727
This doesn't strike you as kind of dumb?

17:08.810 --> 17:09.935
We're family.

17:10.021 --> 17:12.146
We're gonna be doing
lots of dumb stuff together.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.982
Wait till Christmas.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.484
You keep your feet
shoulder-width apart.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.319
Stay between the udder and the hock.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.573
It's a 32 belly option.
On two, on two. Ready. Hut!

17:23.867 --> 17:25.202
Son of a...

17:29.123 --> 17:30.749
Holy schnikes!

17:31.125 --> 17:33.210
Hey, get off my property!

17:33.753 --> 17:35.420
Run for it!

17:40.510 --> 17:42.678
- I'll save you, brother!
- I'm okay.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.346
- Get away from me!
- Get up!

17:44.430 --> 17:46.181
- I can walk.
- I love you.

17:49.727 --> 17:52.270
Hey, get me. My turn. Over here.

17:52.355 --> 17:55.524
These shoes are Italian.
They're worth more than your life.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.610
Man, did I get douched with mud!

17:59.195 --> 18:01.738
Chucko, that doesn't smell like mud.

18:02.281 --> 18:03.949
Man, that's cold.

18:04.409 --> 18:06.034
I'm a maniac

18:06.119 --> 18:09.371
Maniac on the floor

18:09.455 --> 18:13.875
And I'm dancing like
I've never danced before

18:16.754 --> 18:20.173
Did you eat a lot of paint chips
when you were a kid?

18:20.258 --> 18:21.466
Why?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.487
- Good morning, Richard.
- Hi.

18:51.205 --> 18:55.167
Luke, I am your father.

19:02.884 --> 19:04.676
I've interrupted Happy Time.

19:04.761 --> 19:07.679
Look, your father wants you
to check out the delay problems

19:07.764 --> 19:09.139
we're having at the loading dock.

19:09.223 --> 19:12.017
I know you'd love to just sit there
and keep being not slim.

19:12.101 --> 19:14.770
But we gotta work a little today, okay?

19:14.854 --> 19:16.855
- That was from Star Wars.
- I know.

19:24.322 --> 19:26.907
R.T., I think I figured out the problem.

19:26.991 --> 19:30.660
This order's going to Columbus.
That's a one-day delivery

19:30.745 --> 19:33.371
but you've got it marked down for two.

19:33.456 --> 19:37.667
That's because it's going to Columbus,
Georgia, not Columbus, Ohio.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.963
You see these letters by the city?
That's called a state.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.175
What else you got, Wonder Boy?

19:46.719 --> 19:49.137
That's pretty much it for now.

19:49.222 --> 19:52.641
Tommy, maybe you should go back
to college for another seven years

19:52.725 --> 19:54.100
and study a globe.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.103
Tommy Callahan?

19:57.647 --> 20:00.565
Michelle Brock. Chaparrall High.
Remember?

20:00.650 --> 20:04.236
Yeah, I remember.
I sat next to you in History.

20:05.279 --> 20:08.573
You work here?
It's so bizarre that you work here.

20:08.658 --> 20:11.201
Come on in. And forget about R.T.

20:11.285 --> 20:14.955
He's just pissed off 'cause
he recently found out what a loser he is.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.414
What a loser he is.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.042
Hey, nice.

20:19.877 --> 20:22.379
How come you don't put the files
in the file cabinets?

20:22.463 --> 20:24.297
- I don't like file cabinets.
- Why not?

20:24.382 --> 20:26.675
You have to open them.
I've got my own system.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.469
Hasn't failed me yet.
All the shipping orders go through me.

20:29.554 --> 20:32.848
Which means I spend about half
of my pathetically anal life in here.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.474
If I couldn't do things my own way

20:34.559 --> 20:36.560
I'd probably freak out
and blow up the whole town.

20:37.603 --> 20:38.854
Cool.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.356
Remember your brother Duane?

20:41.440 --> 20:44.568
What ever happened to him?
We used to go to Safeway all the time

20:44.652 --> 20:46.361
and get caught trying to steal donuts.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.154
He's a cop.

20:48.239 --> 20:51.116
He had to get a real job when
my parents moved to Cuyahoga Falls.

20:56.706 --> 20:58.999
- Want one?
- I'd better not.

20:59.542 --> 21:02.878
I have what doctors call
a little bit of a weight problem.

21:02.962 --> 21:06.047
I used to grab bear claws as a kid,
two at a time.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.050
And I'd get them lodged
right in this region here.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.803
- How about some coffee?
- I'd love some.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.229
Man, I bet half the town's here.

21:23.733 --> 21:25.483
You look great, Dad.

21:26.527 --> 21:29.154
You look good, too, Tommy Boy.

21:29.864 --> 21:34.534
Listen, Tommy, this marriage thing,
I know it's a big step.

21:34.619 --> 21:37.537
But, you know,
ever since your mom died...

21:42.501 --> 21:47.005
Look, Tommy, something about
getting old and being alone...

21:48.674 --> 21:50.550
You know, something...

21:57.725 --> 22:01.353
Dad, it's cool, you know?
I just want you to be happy.

22:02.271 --> 22:06.024
Yeah, I know you do. And I am, kid.
I am happy, Tommy Boy.

22:07.401 --> 22:10.445
- They're ready for you, sir.
- Good! Well, we're ready, too.

22:12.698 --> 22:15.533
- So, how do we look?
- Chubby?

22:20.039 --> 22:22.666
I think that's the champagne talking.

22:25.544 --> 22:29.631
And so these vows are held sacred
from now until eternity.

22:30.341 --> 22:34.177
If there's any person who finds a reason
these two should not be wed

22:34.261 --> 22:36.429
speak now or forever hold your peace.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.890
- You kidding? Go get them, Tom!
- Yeah.

22:41.268 --> 22:44.980
Now, by the power vested in me
by the State of Ohio

22:45.064 --> 22:47.482
I now pronounce you man and wife.

22:48.359 --> 22:50.235
You may kiss the bride.

23:11.716 --> 23:13.174
- Guys.
- Now look.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.384
Say something to the bride and groom.

23:14.468 --> 23:15.677
Hey, Dad and Beverly.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.430
This is Michelle Brock,
the prettiest gal in Sandusky.

23:18.514 --> 23:20.682
Michelle, say a little something
into the camera.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.684
A little something into the camera.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.352
It sounds good, Tom,

23:24.437 --> 23:27.605
but I'd like to take a look at
your operation before I commit.

23:27.690 --> 23:29.357
Fair enough, Doug.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.526
'Course I could get a good look
at a T-bone steak

23:31.610 --> 23:33.361
by sticking my head up a bull's ass

23:33.446 --> 23:35.739
but I'd rather take
the butcher's word for it.

23:35.823 --> 23:37.699
Bull's ass, that's great.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.576
And you guarantee everything you sell?

23:39.660 --> 23:41.703
You know,
I could guarantee you all day long.

23:41.787 --> 23:45.790
But we both know a guarantee is only
as good as the man who writes it.

23:46.542 --> 23:47.834
It sounds good, Tom.

23:47.918 --> 23:50.670
- I'll send the contract next week.
- All right, good man.

23:50.755 --> 23:52.881
- You're still the best, Tom.
- Eight whiskey sours,

23:52.965 --> 23:55.884
I still sell the son of a bitch.
Damn! I'm good.

23:55.968 --> 23:59.387
I just want to tell you,
you really look dynamite today, Beverly.

23:59.472 --> 24:03.725
Yeah, Tom, you are a lucky man.
Boy, would I like to get some of that!

24:03.809 --> 24:06.936
- Good Lord.
- Oh, God, no.

24:07.021 --> 24:09.481
Listen, Richard,
you got an edit button on that thing?

24:09.565 --> 24:12.734
- It'll cost you.
- Come here, you little prick.

24:12.943 --> 24:16.071
All right. Hold it a second, folks.
Wait a minute.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.697
Yeah, it's working now.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.325
Listen, I want to thank you all
for coming today

24:20.409 --> 24:23.578
to welcome two new Callahans
to the family

24:23.662 --> 24:27.123
my beautiful wife, Beverly,
and my new son, Paul.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.376
I feel like the luckiest man
in the world today.

24:31.504 --> 24:32.587
- Hit it!
- Three, four.

24:32.671 --> 24:35.757
But right now I'm gonna need you,
Tommy Boy

24:35.841 --> 24:37.509
to get this place going.

24:37.593 --> 24:40.553
- But me, Dad?
- Yeah, you, Tommy Boy.

24:40.638 --> 24:43.306
- Get up.
- Dad, I really don't think... Okay.

24:44.433 --> 24:47.519
First rocker, take it, Tommy Boy!

24:49.271 --> 24:52.107
Hey, mama,
don't you treat me wrong

24:52.191 --> 24:54.275
Come and love me,
baby, all night long

24:54.360 --> 24:56.694
Testify, Tommy boy. Testify.

24:56.779 --> 25:01.616
Whoa, all right, now

25:01.700 --> 25:03.952
Tell me what I say

25:04.036 --> 25:05.703
- Second rocker, me!
- Hit it.

25:06.413 --> 25:08.206
See the girl with the diamond ring

25:08.290 --> 25:11.084
She knows
how to twist that thing, oh, oh

25:11.168 --> 25:12.710
That's right, Dad.

25:12.795 --> 25:13.920
Hey, hey

25:14.046 --> 25:15.713
Come on now, Dad.

25:15.798 --> 25:18.049
All right, now

25:18.134 --> 25:19.342
Tell me what I say

25:19.426 --> 25:20.468
What did I say

25:20.553 --> 25:21.803
Hit the "heys" and the "hos."

25:21.887 --> 25:24.389
Hey

25:24.473 --> 25:26.808
Ho

25:26.892 --> 25:27.892
- Hey
- Hey

25:27.977 --> 25:28.977
- Ho
- Ho

25:29.061 --> 25:30.061
- Hey, Ho
- Hey, Ho

25:30.187 --> 25:32.355
Hey, hey, hey, hey

25:34.400 --> 25:37.443
Yeah, Dad, come on now!

25:38.070 --> 25:40.572
Hear what I say

25:40.656 --> 25:42.866
Yeah, what I say

25:42.950 --> 25:44.909
Come on now!

25:49.123 --> 25:51.749
- Dad?
- Somebody call 911.

26:07.433 --> 26:09.934
There's not much more we can say,
really.

26:10.019 --> 26:12.812
We've lost someone we love
and it hurts.

26:14.190 --> 26:19.110
Even though Tom is gone,
he'll remain in our lives forever

26:20.696 --> 26:23.448
comforting us, making us laugh

26:24.867 --> 26:26.659
and watching over us.

27:42.611 --> 27:44.362
My dad gave me this boat.

27:44.613 --> 27:48.283
We'd come out here late at night when
there was no one else on the lake

27:48.367 --> 27:50.994
and then he'd be over there
on the shore

27:51.078 --> 27:53.997
and he'd yell,
"Quit playing with your dinghy!"

27:58.377 --> 28:00.378
I'm gonna really miss him.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.093
- Your father was a great guy.
- Yeah.

28:13.475 --> 28:15.810
I'm really glad you brought me out here.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.520
I can't believe you wanted to.

28:18.022 --> 28:21.024
Although it's pretty fun,
if we had some wind.

28:22.985 --> 28:27.030
I can't believe there's no wind.
You need wind 'cause it...

28:27.406 --> 28:29.532
- Helps push the sail.
- Yeah.

28:33.287 --> 28:35.872
So what are you gonna go do now?

28:37.750 --> 28:41.919
I don't know. But I gotta do something.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.255
And I don't know what.

28:44.882 --> 28:48.509
- Man, do I sound like an idiot.
- No.

28:48.927 --> 28:50.219
Sorry about this wind.

28:50.304 --> 28:52.180
I can't believe there isn't
any wind out here.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.389
This is ridiculous.

28:53.474 --> 28:55.058
No, it's great.

28:55.851 --> 28:59.103
It's very peaceful.

28:59.938 --> 29:03.274
Hey, Tubbo, you ain't moving!

29:04.526 --> 29:07.362
Yeah. Need a little wind here.

29:07.446 --> 29:11.157
No, you need to drop
a couple hundred pounds, blimp!

29:12.868 --> 29:13.951
Rascals.

29:14.912 --> 29:16.954
I guess that's your theory.

29:18.123 --> 29:19.791
So we'll see what happens tomorrow.

29:19.875 --> 29:23.252
Your sail is limp, like your dick!

29:23.504 --> 29:26.589
Watch your language
in front of the lady, punk!

29:26.965 --> 29:28.049
Jeez.

29:28.133 --> 29:29.175
You were saying?

29:29.259 --> 29:31.928
Hey, Gilligan, did you eat the Skipper?

29:32.304 --> 29:35.890
You better pray
to the god of skinny punks

29:36.016 --> 29:38.101
that this wind doesn't pick up

29:38.185 --> 29:42.146
because I'll come over there
and jam an oar up your ass!

29:44.650 --> 29:46.067
Jeepers creepers.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.820
Those guys keep interrupting us.
I'm sorry about that.

29:48.904 --> 29:51.781
- You were saying about the...
- Hey, lady, look out!

29:51.865 --> 29:56.369
- There's a fat whale on your boat!
- Yeah. Free Willy!

29:57.329 --> 29:59.080
Listen up, you little spazoids.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.707
I know where you live
and I've seen where you sleep.

30:01.792 --> 30:04.210
I swear to everything holy
that your mothers will cry

30:04.294 --> 30:06.504
when they see what I've done to you!

30:18.851 --> 30:22.145
I was just kidding.
I have no idea where they live.

30:23.230 --> 30:24.814
That was awesome.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.281
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're in real trouble.

30:33.490 --> 30:37.201
Zalinsky Industries has an offer
on the table to buy us out.

30:37.369 --> 30:40.455
But as you realize,
Callahan has been family-owned

30:40.539 --> 30:43.791
since Tommy's great-grandfather
laid the first brick.

30:43.876 --> 30:46.502
And I'll be damned
if that's gonna change on my watch.

30:46.587 --> 30:48.671
If we sell while our value's still high

30:48.755 --> 30:50.465
everyone who owns stock
in this company

30:50.549 --> 30:52.300
stands to make a lot of money.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.469
That, of course, includes you,
Mrs. Callahan

30:54.553 --> 30:57.096
now that you and Tommy
are the primary shareholders.

30:57.181 --> 30:59.849
It seems vulgar to think about money
at a time like this.

30:59.933 --> 31:02.435
I don't want to hear the word
"sell" again.

31:02.519 --> 31:06.522
But, Ron, we do need that loan to
keep us afloat until we figure things out.

31:06.607 --> 31:08.357
I'm sorry, Frank. We can't do it.

31:08.442 --> 31:11.319
Tom got in way over his head
when he built the brake-pad division.

31:11.403 --> 31:14.322
The bank just can't take a chance
on putting up any more money.

31:14.406 --> 31:18.284
Now, let's face it. When Big Tom died,
Callahan Auto may have died with him.

31:18.368 --> 31:21.162
If this factory goes under,
the whole town goes under.

31:21.246 --> 31:23.498
And that's when the whores come in.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.167
- Here we go.
- Excuse me. What was that?

31:27.085 --> 31:30.838
Men laying their trick money down,
$20 to pay the rent.

31:31.089 --> 31:33.341
Maybe, instead,
I'll spend it on the whore.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.135
Frank, I really don't think
we have any choice.

31:36.386 --> 31:38.012
Maybe I can help.

31:39.014 --> 31:42.266
I'll give you everything I've got.
My house, the stock.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.978
If I give you that stuff as collateral,
then will you give us that loan?

31:46.063 --> 31:48.814
Well, yes, I suppose so.

31:48.899 --> 31:50.858
Wait a second.
What are you saying, Tommy?

31:50.943 --> 31:53.069
You just wanna hand over
your inheritance?

31:53.153 --> 31:55.947
Right.
If it'll help get the brake pads going.

31:56.073 --> 31:58.616
My dad said the new pads
were the future of Callahan.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.159
But who's going to sell them?

32:03.747 --> 32:07.542
- I will. I'll go on my dad's sales trip.
- I'll be damned.

32:07.626 --> 32:11.587
Whores running around doing
their little behind-shake for the menfolk.

32:11.672 --> 32:14.340
- I kind of like her idea.
- For Christ's sake!

32:14.424 --> 32:17.009
Once during the war,
I visited a prostitute.

32:17.094 --> 32:19.387
And my life has been
a living hell ever since.

32:19.471 --> 32:20.805
Now, hold on a minute.

32:20.889 --> 32:24.058
Do we really want to put the future
of the company in Tommy's hands?

32:24.142 --> 32:26.394
We're running low on options here, Ted.

32:26.478 --> 32:29.063
I can hold off Zalinsky
for a couple of weeks.

32:29.147 --> 32:32.066
- What have we got to lose?
- How about the jobs of 300 people?

32:32.150 --> 32:35.319
No offense, Tommy, but you don't know
the first thing about brake pads.

32:36.989 --> 32:40.700
I know I'm probably not the answer
you guys are looking for.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.702
But I feel like I gotta do something.

32:42.786 --> 32:46.289
You're right.
I don't know much about this stuff.

32:47.082 --> 32:48.833
- But he does.
- Oh, no.

32:48.917 --> 32:52.295
That's right. Richard knows more
about brake pads than anyone in here.

32:52.379 --> 32:55.006
And since you were
my dad's right-hand man

32:55.549 --> 32:58.467
I'd say you have the rest of the year
pretty much wide-open.

32:58.552 --> 33:00.011
Time out. Bad idea.

33:00.095 --> 33:02.680
I don't think anyone could help
Baby Huey out there on the road.

33:02.764 --> 33:04.140
Do you have a better suggestion?

33:19.489 --> 33:22.199
I can actually hear you getting fatter.

33:22.868 --> 33:25.161
What did I say
about eating in the car, anyway?

33:25.245 --> 33:27.955
That it's not good,
'cause it spoils your dinner?

33:28.749 --> 33:32.126
Tommy, this is not a vacation for me.
I'm out here against my will.

33:32.210 --> 33:36.005
So the least you can do is pretend
to work. Okay? Now, let's review.

33:36.632 --> 33:39.800
Okay, you're right. Review time.
Let's do it up. Feed me.

33:39.885 --> 33:42.637
First, what are the three grades
of Callahan brake pads?

33:43.388 --> 33:47.767
Personal, commercial,
and agricultural.

33:47.851 --> 33:51.395
And what is our carrying charge for
all the merchandise in the warehouse?

33:51.480 --> 33:52.938
Oh, man!

33:53.023 --> 33:55.483
- One and a half...
- Half percent.

33:55.567 --> 34:00.321
- I knew that. Why can't I remember it?
- Try an association like...

34:00.447 --> 34:03.324
Let's say, the average person
uses 10 percent of their brain.

34:03.408 --> 34:06.202
How much do you use?
One-and-a-half percent.

34:06.370 --> 34:09.413
The rest is clogged with malted hops
and bong resin.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.672
I gotta do this.

34:18.757 --> 34:21.217
This has gotta be the one.
I've gotta do this.

34:21.301 --> 34:22.885
It's gotta be me. It's gotta...

34:24.971 --> 34:28.099
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Sorry. I'm ready.

34:28.350 --> 34:31.268
- Hey, does this suit make me look fat?
- No, your face does.

34:31.687 --> 34:34.605
Okay, let's check you out. All right.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.942
- It's a clip-on.
- Are you sure?

34:38.275 --> 34:39.902
All right. Now, it's sale time.

34:39.985 --> 34:42.862
- So remember, we don't take no...
- No shit from anyone!

34:42.947 --> 34:45.449
- No.
- We don't take no prisoners.

34:45.534 --> 34:46.992
We don't take no for an answer.

34:47.077 --> 34:49.786
Oh, yeah.
We don't take no for an answer.

34:49.871 --> 34:52.456
We don't take no for an answer.
We don't take no for an answer.

34:56.085 --> 34:57.795
- No.
- Okey-dokey.

34:58.046 --> 34:59.672
- No.
- Gotcha! Thanks.

35:00.590 --> 35:02.508
Terrific. Thanks for your time.

35:02.592 --> 35:04.051
Let me say

35:04.845 --> 35:06.011
maybe.

35:07.305 --> 35:09.932
Well, then, I'd just like to add

35:10.016 --> 35:13.144
that the spectrometer readout
on the nickel-cadmium alloy mix

35:13.228 --> 35:15.187
indicates a good rich strobe and fade.

35:15.272 --> 35:17.606
Decreasing incidence of wear
to the pressure plate.

35:17.691 --> 35:20.609
Whoa, little fella,
you're not speaking my language.

35:22.487 --> 35:25.281
What my associate
is trying to say is that

35:26.199 --> 35:29.660
our new brake pads are really cool.
You're not even gonna believe it.

35:30.203 --> 35:33.789
Like, let's say you're driving
along the road with your family

35:33.874 --> 35:35.374
and you're driving along.

35:35.459 --> 35:38.627
Then, all of a sudden, there's a
truck tire in the middle of the road

35:38.712 --> 35:40.212
and you hit the brakes.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.465
Whoa. That was close.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.676
Now, let's see what happens
when you're driving

35:45.761 --> 35:47.845
with the "other guy's" brake pads.

35:48.472 --> 35:52.683
You're driving along, all of a sudden
the kids are yelling from the back seat.

35:52.768 --> 35:55.811
"I gotta go to the bathroom, Daddy."
"Not now, damn it!"

35:55.896 --> 35:57.021
Truck tire.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.857
"I can't stop!"

36:01.443 --> 36:02.443
Help!

36:03.069 --> 36:04.361
There's a cliff.

36:06.281 --> 36:07.907
And your family's screaming:

36:07.991 --> 36:11.285
"Oh, my God! We're burning alive!

36:11.369 --> 36:15.664
"No, I can't feel my legs!"
In comes the meat wagon.

36:18.001 --> 36:21.629
And the medic gets out and says,
"Oh, my God."

36:21.713 --> 36:24.089
New guy's in the corner
puking his guts out.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.720
All because you want to save
a couple extra pennies.

36:29.805 --> 36:32.264
- To me, it doesn't...
- Get out.

36:33.183 --> 36:35.601
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.397
- Do you validate?
- Now!

36:40.732 --> 36:41.941
Okay. Thank you.

36:56.289 --> 36:58.165
- She's a quart low.
- Oh, yeah?

36:58.250 --> 37:00.668
Then guess what?
Open it back up and put it in.

37:00.752 --> 37:02.962
That's your penance
for the puppet show back there.

37:03.046 --> 37:05.464
And while you're at it,
fill it up with gas, okay?

37:05.549 --> 37:09.468
I'm gonna go ask directions
to our next huge, embarrassing failure.

37:09.803 --> 37:11.762
You're a huge, embarrassing failure.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.639
- What?
- Nothing.

37:20.814 --> 37:23.816
Chief, could you tell me
how far it is to Davenport?

37:23.900 --> 37:25.317
22 miles.

37:25.735 --> 37:29.905
- Okay. I can't find it on this map.
- Well, get yourself a new map.

37:35.078 --> 37:36.453
Son of a...

37:38.582 --> 37:39.915
For Pete...

38:01.396 --> 38:03.522
Well, it's gotta be on the map.

38:04.065 --> 38:08.527
Davenport, I mean,
because you say it's 22 miles away.

38:08.612 --> 38:11.780
And you're really smart.
Yet it's not on the map.

38:12.949 --> 38:14.450
I'm picking up your sarcasm.

38:14.534 --> 38:17.161
I should hope so,
because I'm laying it on pretty thick.

38:29.049 --> 38:31.425
That's a map of Illinois, which we're in

38:31.509 --> 38:34.386
on the border of lowa,
which is where Davenport is

38:34.471 --> 38:36.430
22 miles away.

38:37.265 --> 38:40.476
You're in the wrong state.
Get yourself a new map.

38:42.896 --> 38:45.189
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?

38:45.774 --> 38:48.108
Okay. How much do I owe you for gas?

38:48.193 --> 38:50.152
- He didn't pump any.
- What?

38:52.197 --> 38:53.989
Why didn't you pump any gas?

38:54.074 --> 38:57.868
They're all out. They only got diesel.
Better go to the next station.

39:08.004 --> 39:09.213
What'd you do?

39:15.387 --> 39:17.346
I'd just like to welcome you all

39:17.430 --> 39:20.975
to our annual Callahan Employee Night.

39:21.101 --> 39:24.687
I know it doesn't quite feel the same
without Big Tom here.

39:24.813 --> 39:26.522
But we're still a family.

39:26.815 --> 39:29.233
So let's try and have some fun.

39:31.194 --> 39:32.903
Hey, Mr. Rittenhauer,

39:32.988 --> 39:35.906
is it true Tommy's on the road
trying to save this place?

39:35.991 --> 39:40.327
Tom's out there filling in for his dad
until we get things settled here.

39:40.495 --> 39:42.997
Are you kidding? We're all screwed.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.083
That kid's one apple
that fell way off the tree.

39:52.674 --> 39:54.675
Mommy, I want a Popsicle.

39:54.759 --> 39:56.885
"Mommy, I want a Popsicle."

39:58.138 --> 39:59.346
That hurt.

39:59.431 --> 40:02.599
You want to act like a baby,
I'll treat you like one.

40:02.767 --> 40:06.145
Now, if you want to act like a big boy...

40:12.944 --> 40:16.739
- Bad Mommy.
- Don't call me that. It's creepy.

40:16.865 --> 40:19.033
Come on, this is working out better
than we planned.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.202
I thought it'd take a year
to bleed him dry in a divorce settlement.

40:22.287 --> 40:24.580
Instead, the guy croaks
and you own half the company.

40:24.664 --> 40:26.623
But it's too bad he didn't
leave me any cash.

40:26.708 --> 40:27.916
You talk to the banker?

40:28.001 --> 40:30.335
Yeah. Unfortunately your stock
isn't worth dick

40:30.420 --> 40:31.920
until they sell the place.

40:32.005 --> 40:34.506
That moment is rapidly approaching.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.053
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hi.

40:39.137 --> 40:42.306
Mr. Rittenhauer,
is Tommy, you know, doing okay?

40:42.640 --> 40:46.894
Well, sometimes it takes a little time
for a salesman to find his style.

40:47.812 --> 40:50.481
- You think he's finding one?
- I hope so.

40:51.316 --> 40:52.858
Hold on right there, honey.

40:52.942 --> 40:55.319
- I'll see you, Michelle.
- Okay. See you.

41:08.083 --> 41:10.918
I'm telling you, Paul, the only thing
keeping us poor is Tommy.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.294
The guy's an idiot.

41:12.837 --> 41:14.838
He won't sell squat.

41:15.632 --> 41:17.508
This is what I think of Callahan.

41:18.176 --> 41:21.428
Tommy save the factory. That's a laugh.

41:36.486 --> 41:38.529
I don't see any McKeesport.

41:38.613 --> 41:41.532
It's the next town, Tons of Fun.
It's gotta be there.

41:41.616 --> 41:42.950
Okay, where's Moron?

41:43.034 --> 41:45.452
Okay, Moron's here, so McKeesport...

41:47.038 --> 41:49.790
Yeah, look, Magellan,
we're at this wrinkle here.

41:49.874 --> 41:50.874
Deer!

42:01.427 --> 42:04.096
You saw what happened.
There was nothing I could do, right?

42:04.180 --> 42:07.516
Maybe if you didn't lean over to
insult me, you would've seen it coming.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.726
Shut up, Tommy. It's not my fault.

42:09.811 --> 42:13.605
- Poor little furry thing.
- I've never seen one close up before.

42:13.857 --> 42:17.067
What are we gonna do?
We can't just leave it here.

42:26.202 --> 42:28.203
Oh, no,
loading it up took us over an hour.

42:28.288 --> 42:30.914
Now we only got 20 minutes
before Brady Automotive closes.

42:30.999 --> 42:33.834
- Where are we gonna take the deer?
- I don't know, the vet?

42:33.918 --> 42:37.171
- You take dead animals to the vet?
- Why not? I'd take you to the vet.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.298
Yeah, I'll take you to the...

42:39.382 --> 42:40.841
- Got that?
- Shut up.

42:40.925 --> 42:43.177
He's just down the hall, sir,
last door on the left.

42:43.261 --> 42:44.553
Thank you.

42:44.929 --> 42:46.346
What's your hurry?

42:46.598 --> 42:49.266
You know that thing in the back seat?
It's not an air freshener.

42:49.350 --> 42:52.311
It's a dead, rotting deer carcass.
We gotta take care of it quick.

42:52.395 --> 42:55.480
This is one of our oldest customers,
so we should be in and out.

42:55.565 --> 42:58.692
This sales thing isn't so easy.
You can't just go in and out.

42:58.776 --> 43:00.194
You gotta finesse them a little bit.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.863
By finesse do you mean
sputtering out sentence fragments

43:02.947 --> 43:04.198
and lighting things on fire?

43:04.282 --> 43:07.242
No. But it's nice to see you again,
Mr. Insult.

43:07.327 --> 43:11.121
Say, have you seen Richard anywhere?
Because if you do, could you ask him

43:11.206 --> 43:14.708
I mean since he's so good,
if he might want to try selling?

43:14.792 --> 43:15.792
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

43:15.877 --> 43:17.044
Watch and learn.

43:17.962 --> 43:19.838
Of course I understand what no means.

43:19.923 --> 43:21.381
But if I took no for an answer

43:21.466 --> 43:23.967
I'd wind up on a street corner
selling spicy hot dogs

43:24.052 --> 43:27.346
and wearing a funny hat, right?
It makes sense, doesn't it?

43:27.430 --> 43:31.308
Look, I've been doing business with
Callahan since I hung out my shingle.

43:31.392 --> 43:32.476
But I don't like you.

43:32.560 --> 43:35.520
Probably never will.
You're a smug, unhappy little man.

43:35.605 --> 43:38.482
And you treat people
like they were idiots.

43:41.444 --> 43:45.072
Mr. Brady, you and my dad go way back.

43:45.156 --> 43:47.866
Son, I was sorry to hear
about your dad. I was.

43:47.951 --> 43:50.118
But before I decide
to keep my business

43:50.203 --> 43:54.081
with your place, I'd have to come by
and have a look at your new operation.

43:54.165 --> 43:57.125
I'll tell you what, you can take
a good look at a butcher's ass

43:57.210 --> 44:01.088
by sticking your head up there, but
wouldn't you rather take his word for it?

44:01.506 --> 44:02.631
What?

44:02.715 --> 44:05.759
I'm failing to make
the connection here, son.

44:05.843 --> 44:07.219
No. I mean

44:07.303 --> 44:10.931
you can get a good look at a T-bone by
sticking your head up a butcher's ass.

44:11.015 --> 44:14.559
- But then... No. It's gotta be your bull.
- Wow.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.729
Here's the deal. If I want you...

44:17.814 --> 44:20.357
- You have derailed.
- Shut up, Richard.

44:20.525 --> 44:22.734
Boy, I'm really at a loss for words here.

44:22.860 --> 44:26.989
Forget it, I quit.
I can't do this anymore, man.

44:27.073 --> 44:30.701
My head's about to explode.
My whole life sucks.

44:30.785 --> 44:33.412
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know where I'm going.

44:33.496 --> 44:37.749
My dad just died. We just killed Bambi.
I'm out here getting my ass kicked

44:37.834 --> 44:40.961
and every time I drive down the road
I want to jerk the wheel

44:41.045 --> 44:44.214
into a goddamn bridge abutment!

44:44.966 --> 44:46.550
I can't...

44:51.264 --> 44:52.848
We'll be in touch.

45:02.233 --> 45:06.403
- That guy might not call us.
- I can't believe he called me a psycho.

45:06.487 --> 45:09.781
Were you in there just now?
You are a psycho. Good God.

45:09.866 --> 45:10.991
And comb your hair.

45:11.075 --> 45:13.076
Well,
I wouldn't say you did much better.

45:13.161 --> 45:16.663
Thought you were so cool.
"Watch and learn," he says.

45:16.748 --> 45:20.125
Well, I was watching. Know what I saw?

45:27.050 --> 45:28.342
It's alive!

45:30.094 --> 45:32.763
I think it tried to bite me!

45:37.143 --> 45:38.518
Oh, man!

45:59.457 --> 46:01.291
No way that just happened.

46:02.794 --> 46:05.253
My car is completely destroyed.

46:05.338 --> 46:08.131
I swear I've seen a lot of stuff in my life.

46:08.466 --> 46:10.675
But that was

46:11.594 --> 46:13.220
awesome!

46:14.889 --> 46:18.850
But sorry about your car, man.
That sucks.

46:24.732 --> 46:27.734
We'; I return to the Zalinsky Family
Theater after these messages.

46:27.819 --> 46:29.903
Will you shut the window, Tom?
You're letting moths in.

46:29.987 --> 46:31.029
No, it's hot in here.

46:31.114 --> 46:32.906
- Would you please just...
- Look, it's him.

46:32.990 --> 46:34.866
America, if you need starters,
spark plugs,

46:34.951 --> 46:36.535
ball joints, gaskets, cam shafts,

46:36.619 --> 46:39.454
U-joints or rocker arms,
anything that can be screwed or glued

46:39.539 --> 46:41.748
to that car or truck of yours,
come see old Ray.

46:41.833 --> 46:45.544
You want a guarantee?
I got a guarantee stamped on every box.

46:45.628 --> 46:47.838
He's got really weird hair.

46:48.548 --> 46:52.592
But more important is the guarantee
that I make to the American worker.

46:52.677 --> 46:55.387
I want your truck to help you
get the job done.

46:55.471 --> 46:59.141
I want your cruiser to get out there
safely, so you can clean up the streets.

46:59.225 --> 47:01.935
And I want your kids to be safe
when you take them for a ride.

47:02.019 --> 47:03.437
Thanks, Ray.

47:03.521 --> 47:05.063
Thank you, son.

47:05.606 --> 47:09.443
The name's Zalinsky. I make car parts
for the American working man

47:09.527 --> 47:12.779
because that's what I am.
And that's who I care about.

47:12.864 --> 47:16.074
Drive on down to Zalinsky's
The auto parts king!

47:17.368 --> 47:18.743
He seems like a nice guy.

47:18.828 --> 47:20.662
This is the guy trying to
buy the company

47:20.746 --> 47:22.456
not to mention
put you out in the street

47:22.540 --> 47:25.542
and all you can say is,
"He seems like a nice guy."

47:25.626 --> 47:26.877
He does.

47:28.421 --> 47:29.671
Hello.

47:29.755 --> 47:33.592
Michelle! Wow!
I'm glad you called me back.

47:33.676 --> 47:37.679
Yeah, things are going great.
I feel my first sale coming on real soon.

47:38.431 --> 47:39.973
Yeah, he's here.

47:40.057 --> 47:42.267
He's just going over
his car insurance forms.

47:42.351 --> 47:44.853
Could we get any more moths in here?

47:44.937 --> 47:48.440
What? Richard's vacuuming.

47:48.566 --> 47:53.153
He's vacuuming.
I don't know, I guess he's clean.

47:53.237 --> 47:55.989
Michelle, can I call you back
in a few minutes?

47:56.073 --> 47:58.033
Thanks. I miss you. Bye.

47:58.701 --> 48:01.077
You can't sleep with the window open.

48:01.162 --> 48:03.079
And I'm gonna lay down
some other rules, too.

48:03.748 --> 48:05.582
What are you so mad about?

48:05.666 --> 48:10.295
Are you nuts? Do you even have to ask?
My car is destroyed.

48:10.379 --> 48:12.005
We haven't made one sale.

48:12.089 --> 48:13.507
Which means
we only have to sell about

48:13.591 --> 48:16.009
a half a million brake pads
in the next 10 days.

48:16.093 --> 48:19.387
Or else the factory's going under.
And the one guy that should care

48:19.472 --> 48:21.723
about all this, you, doesn't.

48:25.978 --> 48:27.312
You know what, Richard?

48:27.396 --> 48:29.981
You don't know me
as good as you think you do.

48:30.066 --> 48:33.443
I care about stuff.
I'm getting better at this sales thing.

48:34.737 --> 48:37.531
I'm not, but I could if you help me.

48:37.615 --> 48:41.326
Forget it. I got enough to do
without having to change your diapers.

48:45.540 --> 48:49.125
Richard, is this your coat?

48:51.003 --> 48:54.297
- Don't do it.
- Fat guy in a little coat.

48:56.300 --> 48:57.509
Don't.

48:57.593 --> 49:01.596
Fat guy in a little coat

49:06.352 --> 49:10.480
- Take it off, dickhead. I'm serious.
- Richard, what's happening...

49:26.581 --> 49:30.000
- Good tune, man.
- I don't think so.

49:31.502 --> 49:33.253
Yeah. Here we go.

49:35.006 --> 49:36.798
This song sucks.

49:41.929 --> 49:44.514
- Talk about lame.
- Totally.

49:45.182 --> 49:47.851
- You can change it if you want.
- I don't care. It's up to you.

49:47.935 --> 49:50.353
- I can live with it if you can.
- Suit yourself.

50:35.733 --> 50:37.233
Oh, God.

50:54.877 --> 50:56.294
I was just thinking.

50:56.379 --> 51:00.256
When we stopped for gas this morning,
I think it was you who put the oil in.

51:00.424 --> 51:03.301
If you're saying I didn't put
the right kind in, you're wrong.

51:03.386 --> 51:05.220
I used 10W-30.

51:05.304 --> 51:08.765
Besides, motor oil would have nothing
to do with this accident.

51:08.849 --> 51:12.560
True. But you can't latch the hood
too well if you don't take the can out

51:12.645 --> 51:14.437
you no-selling waste of space.

51:14.522 --> 51:16.272
I swear to God you're worthless.

51:17.108 --> 51:18.942
I'm sorry about your car.

51:19.026 --> 51:21.611
But don't call me worthless.
I'm trying my best.

51:21.696 --> 51:24.155
- I'm not my dad.
- That's right. You're not your dad.

51:24.240 --> 51:27.033
He could sell a ketchup Popsicle
to a woman in white gloves.

51:27.118 --> 51:28.535
- Ketchup Popsicle?
- Yeah!

51:28.619 --> 51:30.537
I learned everything I know from him.

51:30.621 --> 51:32.539
I didn't have a father.
He looked out for me.

51:32.623 --> 51:35.458
But you, he was your real dad
and you just took it for granted.

51:35.543 --> 51:39.796
"I'm Big Tom's son. He'll fix everything,
so I'm allowed to be a moron."

51:40.047 --> 51:41.381
That's it!

51:41.465 --> 51:43.258
Get out! Get out of the car!

51:43.342 --> 51:45.510
It's go time. You and me!

51:45.594 --> 51:47.887
"Look, Mommy, the rhino's
getting too close to the car."

51:47.972 --> 51:50.974
"Him too afraid to get out,
he just a little guy."

51:51.058 --> 51:53.059
That's it, big boy. I'm gonna wail on you.

51:53.144 --> 51:55.562
You're gonna regret
volunteering for this job, porky.

51:55.646 --> 51:57.897
Hey, boys and girls, it's Papa Smurf!

51:57.982 --> 51:59.733
You don't want none of me,
think it through.

51:59.817 --> 52:03.486
Come on, give me your best shot.
I'll give you a free one. Let me have it.

52:04.530 --> 52:05.613
That was it?

52:05.698 --> 52:07.073
Come on, you can do better than that.

52:07.158 --> 52:09.492
Can't you, Captain Limp Wrist?
Try again.

52:09.994 --> 52:13.163
Everybody, is there a window open?
I feel a draft.

52:15.958 --> 52:18.585
If I wanted a kiss,
I would have called your mother.

52:21.005 --> 52:22.213
That was a good one.

52:24.341 --> 52:25.842
Hey, Prehistoric Forest.

52:40.524 --> 52:43.860
Richard, do I have a mark on my face?
It really hurts.

52:46.238 --> 52:49.574
Nope, nothing.
I thought I hit you in the shoulder.

52:50.618 --> 52:53.745
My shoulder doesn't hurt very much,
but my face does.

52:54.121 --> 52:55.497
Right here.

52:56.040 --> 52:59.459
Not here or here so much,
but right here.

52:59.543 --> 53:01.085
Nope. Shipshape.

53:02.755 --> 53:05.924
Waitress, could I get that
shrimp cocktail I saw in the glass case?

53:06.008 --> 53:07.050
Yep.

53:07.551 --> 53:09.302
And, you, what can I get...

53:09.595 --> 53:13.640
- Jesus, what happened to your face?
- I knew it. See, Richard?

53:13.724 --> 53:14.891
I'll have chicken wings.

53:14.975 --> 53:17.727
Kitchen's closed until dinner.
We just got cold stuff and desserts.

53:18.979 --> 53:21.356
Boy, some chicken wings
would really hit the spot.

53:21.440 --> 53:23.024
You sure it's closed?

53:23.776 --> 53:26.861
Let me check. Yep, it's closed.

53:26.946 --> 53:30.740
Okay.
I'll just have a sugar packet or two.

53:31.951 --> 53:35.620
- Hey, what's your name?
- Helen.

53:35.704 --> 53:39.499
That's nice. You look like a Helen.
Helen, we're both in sales.

53:39.583 --> 53:43.169
Let me tell you why
I suck as a salesman.

53:43.254 --> 53:45.004
Let's say I go into some guy's office.

53:45.089 --> 53:47.924
Let's say he's even remotely interested
in buying something.

53:48.008 --> 53:49.467
Then I get all excited.

53:49.552 --> 53:52.846
I'm like Jo Jo the Idiot Circus Boy
with a pretty new pet.

53:52.930 --> 53:55.348
The pet is my possible sale.

53:55.432 --> 53:59.394
My pretty little pet, I love you.

53:59.478 --> 54:04.357
So I stroke it and I pet it
and I massage it.

54:04.984 --> 54:06.359
I love it.

54:06.443 --> 54:10.029
I love my little naughty pet.
You're naughty.

54:10.114 --> 54:14.033
Then I take my naughty pet and I go...

54:19.290 --> 54:21.207
I killed it!

54:21.292 --> 54:23.793
I killed my sale!

54:24.962 --> 54:26.504
That's when I blow it.

54:26.589 --> 54:29.799
That's when people like us
have got to forge ahead, Helen.

54:30.009 --> 54:31.384
Am I right?

54:32.845 --> 54:34.470
God, you're sick.

54:35.973 --> 54:37.015
Tell you what.

54:37.099 --> 54:40.101
I'll go turn the fryers back on
and throw some wings in for you.

54:40.853 --> 54:42.395
Thanks, Helen.

54:42.479 --> 54:45.732
Tommy likey. Tommy want wingy.

54:45.983 --> 54:48.234
Did that board to the head
knock something loose?

54:48.319 --> 54:49.527
What are you talking about?

54:49.612 --> 54:51.613
That 180 you just pulled
with the waitress.

54:51.697 --> 54:54.240
- Why can't you sell like that?
- I was just having fun.

54:54.325 --> 54:56.075
If we didn't get the wings, so what?

54:56.160 --> 54:58.620
We still got that Meat Lover's pizza
in the trunk.

54:58.704 --> 55:02.248
You got the wings 'cause you were
relaxed, so you had confidence.

55:02.333 --> 55:06.169
And that's what it takes to sell,
confidence. Your dad had that.

55:06.754 --> 55:09.213
Why do you always
have to de-turd these things?

55:09.298 --> 55:12.050
- My dad was smart, I'm not.
- Very true.

55:12.134 --> 55:13.885
But there's two types of smarts,

55:13.969 --> 55:16.763
book smarts, which waved bye-bye
to you long ago

55:16.847 --> 55:19.182
and there's street smart,
the ability to read people.

55:19.266 --> 55:21.559
And you know how to do that
just like your dad.

55:21.644 --> 55:24.062
He was the best at knowing
what people wanted to hear

55:24.146 --> 55:27.106
and what people needed to hear.
That's what selling is all about.

55:27.191 --> 55:30.944
In a way, these people are buying you,
not just brake pads.

55:31.028 --> 55:33.738
Hey, everybody. It's Tony Robbins.

55:35.824 --> 55:38.117
- Maybe you're right, Richard.
- I think I am.

55:38.202 --> 55:42.163
Holy Lord, look at this guy. Caught him
right after Thanksgiving feast.

55:42.373 --> 55:45.124
- Nice, Richard.
- God, I need a pooper-scooper.

55:52.383 --> 55:56.260
I like your line. And I like your prices.
But there's a problem.

55:56.887 --> 55:58.805
There's no guarantee on the box.

55:58.889 --> 56:02.642
Heck, if something breaks down you can
call me, even if I'm home watching TV.

56:02.726 --> 56:05.561
Callahan has guaranteed
every part sold since 1925.

56:05.646 --> 56:08.106
Maybe so, but it's not on the box.

56:08.190 --> 56:11.609
It should always be on the box,
comforting you, calling out:

56:11.694 --> 56:13.319
"I'm good. I'll never let you down.

56:13.404 --> 56:15.780
"But if I do,
I'm gonna make things all better."

56:15.864 --> 56:18.324
Our brake pads are made
with a non-corrosive polyplated...

56:18.409 --> 56:20.576
If you're not talking about a guarantee,
skip it.

56:20.661 --> 56:23.705
My customers need to see that
little label looking them right in the eye.

56:23.789 --> 56:25.790
You can get a good look
at your butcher...

56:25.874 --> 56:27.166
- No.
- What?

56:27.251 --> 56:29.669
- Remember, chicken wings.
- Chicken wings?

56:29.753 --> 56:32.005
All right, you want to talk
about guarantees, then...

56:32.089 --> 56:34.257
Fellows, you just ran out of time.

56:37.594 --> 56:39.178
Chicken wings.

56:39.722 --> 56:41.764
Let's think about this for a sec, Ted.

56:41.849 --> 56:45.018
Why would somebody
put a guarantee on a box?

56:45.436 --> 56:48.146
- Very interesting.
- Go on, I'm listening.

56:48.230 --> 56:49.647
Here's the way I see it.

56:49.732 --> 56:51.482
A guy puts a fancy guarantee on a box

56:51.567 --> 56:54.193
because he wants you to feel all warm
and toasty inside.

56:54.278 --> 56:57.989
- Yeah. Makes a man feel good.
- Of course it does. Why shouldn't it?

56:58.073 --> 57:00.616
You figure you put that box
under your pillow at night

57:00.701 --> 57:04.203
the Guarantee Fairy might come by
and leave a quarter, am I right, Ted?

57:05.706 --> 57:07.040
What's your point?

57:07.124 --> 57:10.543
The point is, how do you know
the fairy isn't a Krazy Glue sniffer?

57:10.627 --> 57:13.796
"Build a model airplane," says the
little fairy. Well, we're not buying it.

57:13.881 --> 57:16.215
He sneaks into your house once,
that's all it takes.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.719
Next thing there's money missing off the
dresser, your daughter's knocked up.

57:19.803 --> 57:21.220
I've seen it 100 times...

57:21.305 --> 57:23.514
But why do they
put a guarantee on the box then?

57:23.599 --> 57:26.768
Because they know all they sold you
was a guaranteed piece of shit.

57:26.852 --> 57:28.561
That's all it is, isn't it?

57:28.645 --> 57:31.856
If you want me to take a dump
in a box and mark it guaranteed, I will.

57:31.940 --> 57:33.066
I got spare time.

57:33.150 --> 57:36.235
But for now, for your customers' sake,
for your daughter's sake

57:36.320 --> 57:39.822
you might want to think about
buying a quality product from me.

57:41.867 --> 57:43.868
- Okay, I'll buy from you.
- Well, that's...

57:43.952 --> 57:44.994
- What?
- What?

57:48.207 --> 57:50.958
He's made one deal, Paul,
it's not the end of the world.

57:51.043 --> 57:54.253
What would be good for us?
We want to sell the factory.

57:54.338 --> 57:57.715
They're not gonna sell the factory
as long as Tommy keeps making sales.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.258
Why don't you come to bed?

57:59.343 --> 58:01.719
I got it! What does every factory need?

58:02.304 --> 58:05.556
Trucks. They make stuff.
They've got to ship it, it's a must.

58:05.641 --> 58:07.266
You see, it's all very simple really.

58:07.351 --> 58:09.894
Stop the trucks, stop Tommy Boy.

59:02.573 --> 59:03.698
God!

59:05.993 --> 59:07.076
Not good.

59:15.252 --> 59:19.005
Come on, man. Let's at least take five
minutes to celebrate our first victory.

59:19.089 --> 59:20.840
Look, we got lucky, don't jinx it.

59:20.924 --> 59:23.050
We only have a week left
before the loan's due.

59:23.135 --> 59:25.928
I've gotta finish figuring out
our trip tonight so we can jam out early.

59:26.013 --> 59:28.598
I'll tell you what.
You work out all the scientific stuff,

59:28.682 --> 59:30.016
I'll go out and get a pizza.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.475
The only thing I need to figure out

59:31.560 --> 59:34.187
is whether to get Chicago style
or the thin crust.

59:34.271 --> 59:36.439
The salesman has left the building.

59:37.649 --> 59:39.108
See you in a little bit.

59:56.960 --> 59:58.794
Oh, mamacita.

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.258
Hi.

01:00:04.343 --> 01:00:06.427
Tommy, scram.
Don't give her the weight-room thing.

01:00:06.511 --> 01:00:09.597
You know where the weight room is?
I'll check it out.

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:11.641
Sorry.

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.017
Idiot.

01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:15.019
Daddy like.

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:17.438
You get wet, honey.
You deserve a swim.

01:00:17.522 --> 01:00:19.607
Now take off that itchy robe.

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:34.497
Nobody is around. It's naughty time.

01:00:40.963 --> 01:00:44.006
For the love of God, I've been patient.
Please don't stop.

01:00:44.091 --> 01:00:46.467
We've been on the road...
Those are real.

01:00:49.429 --> 01:00:51.013
No one's looking.

01:00:51.306 --> 01:00:53.391
Speaking of no one's looking...

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:57.353
Bad girl.

01:00:58.397 --> 01:00:59.563
Thank you.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.691
I'm back.

01:01:05.654 --> 01:01:08.281
Richard, what were you doing?

01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:10.616
Going over some documents.

01:01:10.742 --> 01:01:13.286
Where are they? Jeez, I don't see them.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.578
They're in my briefcase.

01:01:14.663 --> 01:01:17.123
- I thought you were getting pizza.
- They were closed.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:21.043
How could you be reading documents
when they're in your briefcase?

01:01:21.962 --> 01:01:23.379
That's a mystery.

01:01:24.339 --> 01:01:28.134
Richard, were you watching
Spank-tro-Vision?

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:29.635
Okay, then, let's hit it.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.305
Maybe you were watching a movie
with that funny comedian,

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:35.391
what's his name, Buddy Whack-it?

01:01:35.475 --> 01:01:37.727
All right, then, let's get some shuteye.

01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:40.855
- That's a pretty girl down there.
- Good for her.

01:01:40.939 --> 01:01:43.816
Jeez, I wonder if she goes out
with one of the Yankees.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:46.235
Couldn't tell you.

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:55.077
Big day tomorrow.

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:57.788
I hope we can keep
this momentum going.

01:01:57.873 --> 01:01:59.457
Yep, that'd be good.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:06.464
Richard?
Who's your favorite Little Rascal?

01:02:07.049 --> 01:02:10.259
Alfalfa or is it Spanky?

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:14.221
Sinner.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:29.820
Yes, I'll buy it.

01:02:29.905 --> 01:02:31.280
Yes, I like what I hear.

01:02:31.531 --> 01:02:32.990
Yes, sounds good.

01:02:33.075 --> 01:02:35.576
By the way, did you ever eat paint chips
as a kid?

01:02:42.834 --> 01:02:44.335
- Son of a...
- Jeez.

01:02:44.419 --> 01:02:45.711
I'm okay.

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:56.389
A thousand units to Oshkosh?
Tommy, that's fabulous.

01:02:56.473 --> 01:03:00.643
Your dad never sold 1,000 in Oshkosh.
Not since I've been here.

01:03:49.276 --> 01:03:52.403
Lord, I've never had to tinkle so bad
in all of my life.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.033
What the...

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:00.369
Richard, you're a riot!

01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:03.539
Stop the car. Son of a...

01:04:03.623 --> 01:04:05.291
What the hell's gotten into you?

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.961
My thing got stuck in my zipper,
I got piss all over my pants.

01:04:30.442 --> 01:04:32.651
Okay, thanks. Bye. I owe you.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:35.654
There you are.

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:38.324
While I was waiting,
I thought I'd make a couple of calls.

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:41.035
Okay, Mom.
I'll call you later then. Bye-bye.

01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:45.664
- So what do you want?
- I just wanted to tell you

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:48.083
that Tommy's been
talking a lot about you recently.

01:04:48.168 --> 01:04:51.003
And, well,
I thought you might want to know that.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.630
God, he's so sweet.

01:04:52.714 --> 01:04:56.217
You have no idea how much it means
having you and your mom as family.

01:04:56.301 --> 01:05:00.179
- He says the sweetest things about her.
- Everything he does is sweet.

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:02.014
So when does sweetie get back?

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.682
This Friday, which is great

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:05.851
because we're backed up
on orders as it is.

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:08.479
He turned into this selling machine.

01:05:08.563 --> 01:05:11.440
Well, between that and sweetness,
I'd say hang on to him.

01:05:17.072 --> 01:05:18.405
I gotta go.

01:05:22.077 --> 01:05:24.119
Yes, sir,
I can have that for you tomorrow.

01:05:24.204 --> 01:05:26.789
Well, that would be great.
Thank you, sir.

01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:28.791
Yes!

01:05:40.595 --> 01:05:44.431
- Housekeeping.
- No, thank you. Sleeping.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:49.228
- Housekeeping.
- Can you come back here in an hour?

01:05:51.231 --> 01:05:55.442
- Housekeeping. You want towel?
- No towels, need sleepy.

01:05:56.653 --> 01:05:58.904
Housekeeping, you want mint for pillow?

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:02.783
Please go away.
Let me sleep, for the love of God!

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:07.079
Housekeeping,
you want me jerk you off?

01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:10.165
What kind of hotel is this?

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:13.711
- Oh, it's you.
- Good morning, sunshine.

01:06:13.795 --> 01:06:17.464
Guess what? I just called Auto Tech
and they decided to make an order.

01:06:17.591 --> 01:06:20.926
So, according to my calculations,
that puts us over the mark.

01:06:21.386 --> 01:06:23.137
- We did it?
- We did it.

01:06:23.221 --> 01:06:27.516
Yes! Richard, I'm so happy. Hold me.

01:06:27.892 --> 01:06:30.352
- Yikes.
- Don't run away from your feelings.

01:07:55.689 --> 01:07:58.565
Something went haywire
down at Shipping and Receiving.

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:01.026
Your shipments got screwed up
in the computer,

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:02.903
the wrong parts
went to the wrong cities.

01:08:02.987 --> 01:08:04.571
Now all hell has broken loose.

01:08:04.656 --> 01:08:05.906
I don't believe this.

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:08.617
Okay. So we call everyone
and explain what happened.

01:08:08.702 --> 01:08:10.828
Half the orders have
already been canceled.

01:08:10.912 --> 01:08:11.912
What?

01:08:11.996 --> 01:08:14.832
They think it's an indication
of how things work around here.

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:18.377
The real problem is that we won't be
able to make the payment to the bank.

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:21.755
This is like a bad Twilight Zone.
I think I'm growing a tumor.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.550
Look, we talk to the bank,
maybe they'll give us a break.

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:27.511
Hell, we've been doing business
with them for 23 years.

01:08:27.595 --> 01:08:29.388
Tommy, it's all over.

01:08:29.471 --> 01:08:33.225
You made a valiant effort,
but we're gonna have to sell to Zalinsky.

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:35.810
I'm flying to Chicago
to sign over the company.

01:08:35.895 --> 01:08:39.064
- What's gonna happen to the factory?
- He's gonna shut it down.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.191
Zalinsky doesn't care
about our workers.

01:08:41.276 --> 01:08:43.986
He wants the Callahan name, that's all.

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:45.863
Did anyone see Scanners?

01:08:45.947 --> 01:08:49.950
The bottom line is, by 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow we'll all be unemployed.

01:08:59.627 --> 01:09:01.086
Don't say anything, okay?

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:03.921
I know I've ruined your entire life
and you hate me.

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:07.801
So let me just pack my things and I'll go
crawl into a dark hole for a few years.

01:09:07.886 --> 01:09:08.969
Hi.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:16.185
- So, do you hate me?
- I just don't get it.

01:09:17.312 --> 01:09:19.104
I guaranteed overnight delivery.

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:21.899
I mean, we faxed you
our shipping addresses, didn't we?

01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:25.861
Yes. And they were right when I
put them into my computer, I swear.

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:27.362
Then how could...

01:09:27.447 --> 01:09:29.031
Man, this was so big!

01:09:29.115 --> 01:09:31.825
I know it was big, but it wasn't my fault.

01:09:33.953 --> 01:09:37.747
Why can't you put your files
in the file cabinets like everybody else?

01:09:37.832 --> 01:09:40.459
Maybe if you weren't such a rebel
you could avoid...

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:42.127
Don't worry, because I've quit.

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:45.005
So you won't have to put up
with anything anymore.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.258
Michelle, wait. Come on, please?

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:57.476
Thanks. Have a good flight.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.519
May I help you?

01:09:58.603 --> 01:10:00.646
I called about a ticket
to Cuyahoga Falls.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:01.980
- The name's Brock.
- Right.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:05.275
That flight's going through Columbus.
Let me just call that up for you.

01:10:12.492 --> 01:10:13.784
Excuse me.

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:21.083
Come on.

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:24.419
Hello, is Detective Duane Brock
on duty today?

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:30.175
This town doesn't even know
what's about to hit it.

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.844
Fish in a barrel, my friend.

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:34.221
Town's the fish,
the people are the barrel.

01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:36.098
Fish in a barrel.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.480
What's wrong with you, Richard?
You can't drink in a car.

01:10:43.565 --> 01:10:45.524
Don't you know
we can get busted for that?

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:47.693
I'm sorry. I did not know that.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:49.695
But right now we got a bigger problem.

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:51.572
- That is?
- Beer's coming back up.

01:10:51.656 --> 01:10:52.948
Oh, Lord!

01:10:56.035 --> 01:10:57.160
Here we go.

01:10:59.414 --> 01:11:02.541
Cops! Damn it, Richard.
The whole car smells like beer.

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:05.377
They're never gonna believe
I wasn't drinking.

01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:08.672
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

01:11:08.756 --> 01:11:10.173
I've got an idea.

01:11:12.427 --> 01:11:13.802
What the hell?

01:11:14.596 --> 01:11:16.221
When I stop the car, run out screaming.

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:17.347
No problem.

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:24.187
Little trick my dad taught me.

01:11:29.903 --> 01:11:33.572
Bees! Bees in the car!

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.449
Bees everywhere!

01:11:35.909 --> 01:11:39.369
God, they're huge!
They're ripping my flesh off!

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:43.916
Son, roll around. Did you hear me?
Roll around on the ground.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.460
Forget that. I'm starting to swell up!

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:49.087
Save yourself, Tommy!
Don't be the hero!

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:52.090
- Frank, I'm allergic to bees.
- Me, too.

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:54.217
They're huge and they're sting-crazy!

01:11:54.302 --> 01:11:55.886
We'll come back later
and check on you.

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:56.970
Yeah, in a while.

01:11:57.055 --> 01:11:58.138
Save yourself!

01:11:58.222 --> 01:12:00.515
Your firearms are useless against them!

01:12:05.438 --> 01:12:07.356
Holy schnikes, it worked.

01:12:07.982 --> 01:12:10.192
I just barfed on an ant hill.

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:14.446
Cool. Whoa. I think they're pissed.

01:12:16.991 --> 01:12:19.952
Yeah. That's the answer.

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:21.787
It doesn't look like the answer.

01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:24.665
- I don't remember eating that.
- No! Zalinsky.

01:12:24.749 --> 01:12:27.167
We'll go to Chicago,
tell him we're not for sale.

01:12:27.251 --> 01:12:30.045
He seems like a good guy on TV.
He'll understand.

01:12:30.129 --> 01:12:32.798
You are dreaming. You can't stop him.

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:35.008
You lost your shares to the bank,
remember?

01:12:35.093 --> 01:12:38.971
What the hell! In less than 24 hours
I lose the factory anyway.

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:40.931
So why not give it a shot?

01:12:41.933 --> 01:12:44.768
- Chicago?
- Chicago.

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:56.863
- You can't park here.
- Keep it.

01:12:56.948 --> 01:12:58.699
Where are you going?

01:12:58.783 --> 01:13:01.618
Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

01:13:01.703 --> 01:13:04.162
Hi, Michelle, this is Tommy.

01:13:04.414 --> 01:13:08.875
Listen, I'm sorry about what I said.
I was being an idiot.

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:12.337
I want to apologize
'cause I didn't mean it.

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:16.800
Anyway, Richard and I are going
to Chicago to straighten things out.

01:13:16.884 --> 01:13:19.469
The next flight to Chicago
boards in five minutes

01:13:19.554 --> 01:13:22.139
but I'm sorry, it's completely sold out.

01:13:22.223 --> 01:13:25.350
I can put you on another one
at 3:00 this afternoon.

01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:28.353
Lady, we really need to get to Chicago.
It's an emergency.

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:30.439
Is there anything you can do?

01:13:31.315 --> 01:13:35.861
I can put you in at Salt Lake City
by 4:00. And there's another flight...

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:37.571
I don't have time to go
through another city.

01:13:37.655 --> 01:13:39.948
I need a direct flight to Chicago.

01:13:40.408 --> 01:13:44.453
I can reserve you a flight coming
back from Chicago at 5:55.

01:13:44.537 --> 01:13:47.706
- Does that help?
- Hi, I'm Earth. Have we met?

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:49.958
I don't think so.

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:53.378
So I'll talk to you later? Okay, bye.

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:56.715
We're screwed. No tickets to Chicago.
Not even stand-by.

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:59.009
There's got to be something we can do.

01:13:59.093 --> 01:14:00.177
Flight 481 for Chicago...

01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:03.513
Wait a minute. You got any money?

01:14:03.931 --> 01:14:05.682
'Cause I got a plan.

01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:07.434
Yikes!

01:14:13.107 --> 01:14:15.400
We're gonna get busted,
let's get out of here.

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:17.944
Too late. Hey, guess who's here?

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:21.323
What are we serving tonight,
chicken or chicken?

01:14:21.532 --> 01:14:24.785
What a nice surprise, they said we
were gonna be short-handed this leg.

01:14:24.869 --> 01:14:27.537
You two take coach.
Could you handle the announcements?

01:14:27.622 --> 01:14:30.707
- Okey-dokey. No problemo.
- They're gonna know we're bogus.

01:14:30.792 --> 01:14:33.585
Relax. You get on the horn.
I'll throw some peanuts at them.

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:35.420
We'll be in Chicago before you know it.

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:43.095
Okay, folks.
The guy in front of you is Tommy.

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:45.764
He'll be taking you
through my little spiel here.

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:49.601
Tommy is a Scorpio, he likes biking,
and he's never been laid.

01:14:52.563 --> 01:14:54.773
Exits. Okay, there's one back here

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:58.944
and there's probably one
over by the wing somewhere. Usually.

01:14:59.153 --> 01:15:00.612
And what about seat belts?

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:03.698
To fasten, take the little end
and stick it in the big end and...

01:15:03.783 --> 01:15:04.866
Hey, know what?

01:15:04.951 --> 01:15:07.494
If you don't know how to use
a seat belt, ring your call button

01:15:07.578 --> 01:15:09.955
and Tommy will come hit you on
the head with a tack hammer

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:11.248
'cause you're a retard.

01:15:11.332 --> 01:15:13.416
Okay, and life preservers.

01:15:13.501 --> 01:15:15.377
These, we may need.

01:15:15.461 --> 01:15:17.587
Although what are the odds of us
actually hitting a lake?

01:15:17.672 --> 01:15:20.173
My money says if anything
it's gonna be a mountain.

01:15:20.258 --> 01:15:23.552
To inflate, put it around your neck
and yank down on the tabs.

01:15:25.012 --> 01:15:26.054
Damn!

01:15:26.597 --> 01:15:27.973
Son of a...

01:15:28.641 --> 01:15:30.475
I can't breathe!

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.188
I'm choking!

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.861
He's a big, dumb animal, isn't he, folks?

01:15:42.947 --> 01:15:45.448
Folks, we're making our final approach
into Chicago.

01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:48.201
Ma'am, you still alive?

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.081
Ma'am, there's a half-hour time limit.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:01.923
¡Ay, caramba!

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:13.602
Okay, now, we're running out of time,
so you can't go see Zalinsky like that.

01:16:13.686 --> 01:16:15.270
Now, go change.

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:20.901
Go.

01:17:15.706 --> 01:17:17.415
Can you do your seat belt?

01:17:33.099 --> 01:17:35.350
I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm fine now.

01:17:48.406 --> 01:17:51.199
- What are you doing?
- I'm nervous, so I'm sweating.

01:17:51.284 --> 01:17:55.120
You're gonna smell like a cab driver.
Not to say that that's bad.

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:57.038
I want to be fresh for the meeting.

01:17:57.123 --> 01:18:01.459
- You look good. Are you ready?
- Ready or not, this is crunch time.

01:18:01.919 --> 01:18:03.545
525, that's it.

01:18:07.717 --> 01:18:10.135
Son of a... That's gonna leave a mark.

01:18:10.636 --> 01:18:12.012
Look at this place.

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:15.557
Welcome to the pros.

01:18:15.641 --> 01:18:16.975
No way! It's him!

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:20.895
There he is, my friend.
The King himself.

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:25.442
Let's do it. It's go time.

01:18:31.532 --> 01:18:33.033
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

01:18:33.117 --> 01:18:35.118
You check the elevators.
I'll check the bank.

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:46.212
Where is he?

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.425
Listen up. This will only take a second.

01:18:51.344 --> 01:18:52.761
Does anybody...

01:18:57.308 --> 01:18:58.767
Jeez.

01:19:03.522 --> 01:19:05.982
- What's going on out here?
- Walk slow.

01:19:06.317 --> 01:19:08.610
- Okay. Why?
- Nothing.

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:11.905
- Am I consorting with a known felon?
- Shut up, Richard.

01:19:11.989 --> 01:19:14.199
Hey, Mom,
it's the guy who robbed the bank.

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:16.785
- I didn't rob any bank.
- Yeah, right.

01:19:16.869 --> 01:19:20.121
Like it was some other real fat guy
with a tiny head.

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.916
I got a tiny head?

01:19:27.088 --> 01:19:28.338
Zalinsky.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.094
Say something.

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:41.768
Mr. Zalinsky? I'm Tommy Callahan,
Big Tom Callahan's son.

01:19:42.812 --> 01:19:45.647
Sorry to hear about your dad.
He was a good man.

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:50.860
Went a little heavy
on the pine-tree perfume there, kid.

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:53.738
Sir, it's a taxi-cab air freshener.

01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:57.075
Great, you've pinpointed it.
Step two is washing it off.

01:19:58.244 --> 01:20:00.161
Sir, what exactly happened here?

01:20:00.246 --> 01:20:01.996
He came out of the shadows behind me.

01:20:02.081 --> 01:20:05.291
And after he hit me many times
in the head with a hammer,

01:20:05.376 --> 01:20:08.044
I had to give him my gun.
You know, I've got kids.

01:20:08.129 --> 01:20:10.922
So, as more details emerge
on this attempted bank robbery

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.799
Action 8 will be there.

01:20:13.843 --> 01:20:16.928
But the Callahan factory
has been in my family for 70 years,

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.596
you can't just shut it down.

01:20:18.681 --> 01:20:20.640
You got to look at it
from my point of view.

01:20:20.724 --> 01:20:23.476
Callahan's a premium name.
That's what I'm buying.

01:20:23.561 --> 01:20:26.521
I can make the parts in one of my
factories, put them in a Callahan box

01:20:26.605 --> 01:20:28.606
and sell them in my stores
at a premium price.

01:20:28.691 --> 01:20:31.651
Why keep your factory going
when all I want is the goddamn box?

01:20:31.735 --> 01:20:34.362
I'll tell you why.
Because there's a town involved here.

01:20:34.447 --> 01:20:37.198
Callahan factory is the only thing
keeping it alive.

01:20:37.283 --> 01:20:40.285
Believe it or not, I'm providing a service.
I'm thinning the corporate herd.

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:42.996
You've seen Daktari,
the weaker animals always go.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.874
Sure the kids cry when you tie old Tiger
to a tree and shoot him.

01:20:45.958 --> 01:20:48.126
But that's life.
America's in a state of renewal.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.879
We gotta have the strength
to tie a few factories to a tree

01:20:50.963 --> 01:20:52.297
and bash them with a shovel.

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.507
Meanwhile, if I can grab your share
of the market,

01:20:54.592 --> 01:20:56.968
put a little coin in my pocket
by being the asshole,

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.053
well, what the hell? Know what I mean?

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:01.973
Boy, you sure are different
in your TV commercials.

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:04.392
What the American public
doesn't know

01:21:04.477 --> 01:21:06.186
is what makes them
the American public.

01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:07.562
All right?

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:11.941
God, I love that.

01:21:12.026 --> 01:21:13.776
Hell, folks believe me when I tell them

01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:15.987
we're not just building
automotive components here,

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:18.698
we're adding horsepower
to American industry.

01:21:24.747 --> 01:21:27.874
You say one word to anyone and I will
kill you, do you understand me?

01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:29.501
It looks real.

01:21:33.297 --> 01:21:35.673
Yeah, television's been
good to me, son.

01:21:35.799 --> 01:21:38.551
"I make car parts
for the American working man

01:21:38.636 --> 01:21:41.638
"because that's what I am,
and that's who I care about."

01:21:43.349 --> 01:21:46.351
The truth is, I make car parts
for the American working man

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:49.270
because I'm a hell of a salesman,
and he doesn't know any better.

01:21:49.355 --> 01:21:52.482
Son, since you're no longer
a shareholder, this is where I leave you.

01:21:52.566 --> 01:21:55.735
Don't feel bad. This chain of events
was set in motion a long time ago.

01:21:55.819 --> 01:21:58.530
You and your bald-headed friend did
what you could, that's commendable.

01:21:58.614 --> 01:22:00.907
Marty, have Security see these boys out.

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:03.701
- Mrs. Callahan.
- Sir.

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:05.620
I trust your trip went well.

01:22:06.705 --> 01:22:08.873
What's my family doing in there?

01:22:19.552 --> 01:22:21.344
I thought they were on my side.

01:22:21.428 --> 01:22:24.264
They had a lot to gain
if the factory was sold.

01:22:24.765 --> 01:22:26.432
Boy, did I screw up.

01:22:26.725 --> 01:22:30.228
My so-called family deserted me.
Michelle's mad at me.

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:33.898
I lost the factory. The town's
going under, and I'm out of a job.

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:39.153
Could have done without that.
Jeez! I'm an idiot!

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:45.910
- Boy, I sure let my dad down.
- You tried as hard as you could.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.997
When we first started out,
I thought you'd just walk through this

01:22:49.081 --> 01:22:51.708
like you walk through everything else.
But you didn't.

01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:54.210
Your dad would have been proud of you.

01:22:55.045 --> 01:22:56.546
And you got a friend out of it.

01:22:56.630 --> 01:23:00.008
Now, I know it doesn't matter,
because you have so many, but

01:23:00.759 --> 01:23:02.051
I don't.

01:23:04.888 --> 01:23:06.222
Thanks, man.

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:10.018
Tommy!

01:23:11.562 --> 01:23:12.729
Michelle!

01:23:12.813 --> 01:23:14.939
- Don't tell her about my hair.
- Let it go.

01:23:15.024 --> 01:23:16.941
God, I was worried I wouldn't find you.

01:23:17.026 --> 01:23:19.152
- What are you doing here?
- I got your message.

01:23:19.236 --> 01:23:21.487
Okay, I was at the airport.
I was going home

01:23:21.572 --> 01:23:24.949
and I saw your stepbrother and your
stepmother and he was kissing her.

01:23:25.034 --> 01:23:26.701
- So?
- With his tongue.

01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:30.455
- He's doing his mommy?
- She's not his mom. They're married.

01:23:30.539 --> 01:23:32.457
They were lying to your dad
the whole time.

01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:34.667
My brother got his police report. See?

01:23:34.752 --> 01:23:37.587
- They lied to my dad?
- They're con artists. They suckered him.

01:23:37.671 --> 01:23:39.297
They lied to my dad.

01:23:48.515 --> 01:23:52.602
Richard, I'm gonna need your watch.
I've got a plan.

01:23:52.686 --> 01:23:53.895
Yikes!

01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:06.658
Folks, Mr. Zalinsky gave us
specific instructions

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:08.326
to bar you from the building.

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:11.120
Sorry, boys.
Hopefully, we'll just be in and out.

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:13.623
- My God, he's wired.
- And no cops.

01:24:13.707 --> 01:24:15.750
Wouldn't want things to get messy.

01:24:20.798 --> 01:24:22.548
- That was fun.
- Now what?

01:24:22.633 --> 01:24:25.426
Well, it's 6:00. Time for the news.

01:24:27.221 --> 01:24:29.055
Excuse me! Miss?

01:24:29.473 --> 01:24:30.598
Oh, God.

01:24:34.186 --> 01:24:35.561
Done this before?

01:24:36.522 --> 01:24:38.022
Thank you, Marty.

01:24:43.946 --> 01:24:46.114
My, your hands move quickly.

01:24:46.615 --> 01:24:49.534
Only when I see something I want,
Mrs. Callahan.

01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:52.537
It just doesn't seem right.

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:54.831
Hi! Got a second?

01:24:54.957 --> 01:24:57.583
- What the hell's going on here?
- Oh, my God. We're gonna die.

01:24:57.668 --> 01:25:00.628
- Tommy, what are you doing?
- Hi, Ted. Hi, Frank. Excuse me, Marty.

01:25:00.754 --> 01:25:01.879
Okay, we're live.

01:25:01.964 --> 01:25:05.383
We now switch live to our reporter
who is at the scene with the bomber.

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:06.968
This is Nicole Taylor
in downtown Chicago.

01:25:07.052 --> 01:25:08.136
Look, it's Tommy!

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:11.180
...who says he strapped a bomb...
- Nicole, I've got something to say.

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.807
Please. May I?

01:25:13.684 --> 01:25:16.310
Hi, this is Tommy Callahan here
with Mr. Ray Zalinsky

01:25:16.395 --> 01:25:17.895
American Auto Parts King.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:20.606
Honey, look at this human bomb
on the news.

01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:25.403
Yeah, I buy brake pads off him.
I thought we were watching cartoons.

01:25:26.864 --> 01:25:29.782
Mr. Zalinsky, for years
you've been putting ads on TV.

01:25:29.867 --> 01:25:34.620
And they always end up with you saying,
"I make car parts for..."

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:36.289
How does it go?

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:40.585
I make car parts
for the American working man

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:43.671
because that's what I am
and that's who I care about.

01:25:43.797 --> 01:25:47.383
And that's why I'm here, Ray.
You see, back in Sandusky, Ohio,

01:25:47.468 --> 01:25:49.969
there are 300 American workers
at Callahan Auto.

01:25:50.053 --> 01:25:52.305
We make the best parts money can buy.

01:25:52.389 --> 01:25:55.099
Right now those workers
are in danger of losing their jobs.

01:25:55.184 --> 01:25:57.477
They're praying somebody's gonna
step up and help them.

01:25:57.561 --> 01:25:59.645
Is that why you
strapped a bomb to your chest?

01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:01.856
This isn't a bomb.
These are road flares.

01:26:02.274 --> 01:26:05.443
Road flares? Did you live under
power lines as a kid or something?

01:26:05.944 --> 01:26:06.986
Why?

01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:09.614
You guys want this
or American Gladiators?

01:26:10.073 --> 01:26:11.240
Gladiators.

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:14.535
So, do you think Zalinsky Industries
can help these folks?

01:26:14.787 --> 01:26:16.704
I'll be happy to look into it.

01:26:17.206 --> 01:26:19.749
I'll tell you what.
I can get a good look at a T-bone

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:21.459
by sticking my head up a bull's ass

01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:24.170
but I'd rather take
the butcher's word for it.

01:26:25.297 --> 01:26:28.382
Am I just severely wasted
or does Tommy look bloated?

01:26:28.467 --> 01:26:32.386
No, it's TV, man.
Camera adds a couple hundred pounds.

01:26:33.305 --> 01:26:35.431
Ray, we're not looking
for a handout here.

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.183
I'm offering you a great deal.

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:40.353
This is an order for half a million
Callahan brake pads

01:26:40.437 --> 01:26:41.729
to be sold in your stores

01:26:41.814 --> 01:26:45.691
made by the American working man
for the American working man.

01:26:49.863 --> 01:26:51.823
Well, absolutely.

01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:54.826
It would be my great pleasure.
I mean, what have I got to lose?

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:56.744
A great American product, right?

01:26:56.829 --> 01:26:59.997
I don't believe it. Tommy just sold
half a million brake pads.

01:27:00.123 --> 01:27:04.168
Tommy just sold
a half a million brake pads!

01:27:04.253 --> 01:27:05.253
Yeah!

01:27:10.342 --> 01:27:11.634
What difference does it make?

01:27:11.718 --> 01:27:14.428
The company's gonna be mine
in 10 minutes anyway, right?

01:27:15.931 --> 01:27:17.974
Mr. Zalinsky, thank you.

01:27:18.058 --> 01:27:19.934
Thank you, Tommy Boy. And thank you.

01:27:20.018 --> 01:27:23.688
And remember, you can pick up these
great brake pads from Callahan Auto

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:27.441
at all my Zalinsky Auto Parts outlets
all over North America.

01:27:27.568 --> 01:27:28.943
Go, Tommy!

01:27:29.027 --> 01:27:30.945
For the moment it looks like a tragedy

01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:33.364
has been averted
and a town has been saved.

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:36.576
For Action News, I'm Nicole Taylor,
reporting live.

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:38.953
Okay. We're out of here.

01:27:39.288 --> 01:27:41.998
Wait a minute, fat boy.
You lost your shares to the bank.

01:27:42.082 --> 01:27:44.000
You don't even have a right to be here.

01:27:44.126 --> 01:27:45.960
Gee, funny you should bring that up.

01:27:46.044 --> 01:27:48.754
'Cause I'm not sure
that you have the right to be here.

01:27:48.839 --> 01:27:50.673
What have we got here?

01:27:50.757 --> 01:27:53.676
- My God, it's a police report.
- Now what's all this about?

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.721
Let's see.
Paul Barrish, married, May, 1993

01:27:56.805 --> 01:27:59.056
to Beverly Barrish, a.k.a. Beverly Burns.

01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:02.977
Richard, how could Beverly be married
to Paul and my dad at the same time?

01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:05.104
- Interesting.
- Yes. Provocative.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.066
What I think it means is your marriage
to my dad was never legal.

01:28:09.151 --> 01:28:11.736
Which also means that Beverly's shares
still belong to Tommy.

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.697
- Isn't that right, Mr. Rittenhauer?
- Yes. I believe that's right.

01:28:14.781 --> 01:28:16.198
- Mr. Reilly?
- I'd say that's right.

01:28:16.283 --> 01:28:18.034
- Mr. Gilmore?
- Absolutely.

01:28:18.535 --> 01:28:19.785
And let me guess.

01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:22.246
You're not going to be selling me
the company now.

01:28:22.331 --> 01:28:25.124
- Are you, Tommy Boy?
- No, sir.

01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:27.627
Ray, I have no idea
what they're talking about.

01:28:27.711 --> 01:28:30.254
That's it. I'm not going to take this.

01:28:30.339 --> 01:28:32.882
- It's not over yet, Lee Harvey.
- Let's see.

01:28:33.342 --> 01:28:36.344
Warrants outstanding:
New Mexico, mail fraud

01:28:36.428 --> 01:28:38.262
Colorado, wire fraud

01:28:38.347 --> 01:28:41.933
and coming soon to Ohio,
computer fraud.

01:28:45.145 --> 01:28:46.228
Get him!

01:28:46.313 --> 01:28:48.356
Don't let him leave the complex, Marty.

01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:56.864
- Hey, you forgot your wife.
- Screw you. Screw all of you!

01:28:58.617 --> 01:29:00.701
Crash test in progress.

01:29:02.663 --> 01:29:05.039
- Not good.
- Hit the brakes.

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:21.222
That will ruin his weekend.

01:29:21.306 --> 01:29:23.057
Well, kid, you threw one by me.

01:29:23.141 --> 01:29:25.768
Savor the flavor because it sure as hell
won't happen again.

01:29:25.852 --> 01:29:28.270
- In the meantime, good luck to you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:29:28.397 --> 01:29:30.898
Marty, cut a check to Callahan Auto
for those brake pads.

01:29:30.983 --> 01:29:32.441
- Yes, sir.
- And you,

01:29:32.526 --> 01:29:35.069
with all this excitement here,
I kind of got a little hungry.

01:29:35.153 --> 01:29:38.072
Want to step over to my club
and we'll grab something to eat?

01:29:41.451 --> 01:29:43.494
- Thank you. I'd like that.
- Good.

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:45.871
Marty, find out where the police
will be taking him.

01:29:45.956 --> 01:29:48.207
Send over a bottle of bubbly
with a bucket of ice and a card.

01:29:48.291 --> 01:29:50.042
Have it say, "Tough break.
Get drunk on me.

01:29:50.127 --> 01:29:52.920
"Use the bucket to ice down
your marbles. Yours, Z."

01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:57.008
Well, Mr. Callahan,
looks like we're back in business.

01:29:57.092 --> 01:29:58.634
Yes, sir, Mr. Rittenhauer.

01:29:58.719 --> 01:30:00.177
- That's great, Tommy.
- Great, Tommy.

01:30:00.262 --> 01:30:01.470
Thanks.

01:30:02.055 --> 01:30:04.140
Way to go, Tommy Callahan.

01:30:11.106 --> 01:30:14.775
- That was pathetic.
- Shut up, Richard.

01:30:17.237 --> 01:30:19.447
This is a very proud day for me.

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:24.160
I want to introduce you
to the new president of Callahan Auto,

01:30:24.453 --> 01:30:26.537
Tom Callahan, Jr.

01:30:33.086 --> 01:30:35.004
Tommy, will you say something?

01:30:40.552 --> 01:30:44.305
Ever since I was a kid, you people
have been like a family to me.

01:30:46.224 --> 01:30:48.684
Louis, we built our first fort together.

01:30:48.977 --> 01:30:52.563
And, Danny, remember when we used
to burn ants with a magnifying glass?

01:30:54.566 --> 01:30:58.652
R.T., I lost my virginity to your daughter,
for crying out loud.

01:31:00.864 --> 01:31:02.656
Rob, you were there.

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:07.828
Anyway, I just want you to know
that as long as I'm around

01:31:07.913 --> 01:31:09.455
I'm gonna bust my butt

01:31:09.539 --> 01:31:11.373
and make sure that
every last one of you

01:31:11.458 --> 01:31:14.001
always has a job right here at Callahan.

01:31:42.322 --> 01:31:44.949
Dad, I got a little problem here.

01:31:45.408 --> 01:31:47.952
I've been stuck out here for an hour
with no wind again

01:31:48.036 --> 01:31:50.538
and I'm supposed to be at Michelle's
for dinner.

01:31:51.248 --> 01:31:54.250
So if you could give me a little help
I'd appreciate it.

01:31:54.417 --> 01:31:56.377
If not, don't worry about it.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.674
I'm trying to do everything
I think you'd be doing

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.093
and so far it's going pretty good.

01:32:04.469 --> 01:32:07.513
I just want to tell you
that I still love you and

01:32:09.224 --> 01:32:10.933
I sure miss you a lot.

01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:30.578
Thanks, Dad.

01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:34.498
Son of a... That's gonna leave a mark.
