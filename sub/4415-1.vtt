WEBVTT

00:05.271 --> 00:07.140
Whoa.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.808
Where are you going
dressed like that?

00:08.808 --> 00:10.643
To meet some friends.

00:10.643 --> 00:13.479
Is one of those friends
a Japanese businessman?

00:13.479 --> 00:14.781
LINA: I think what
Daddy means is

00:14.781 --> 00:17.216
your outfit sends
the wrong message.

00:17.216 --> 00:20.219
Yeah, you're dressed
like a slut.
Mom!

00:20.219 --> 00:22.689
LINA:
<i>Russ, don't say "slut," okay?</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:25.458
What?
When you really
mean "escort."

00:25.458 --> 00:27.527
LINA: You know,
she's high end.
RUSS: Oh. Oh.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.162
So, like, the type that gets

00:29.162 --> 00:31.164
her gym membership
and cell phone paid for?

00:31.164 --> 00:33.533
Maybe even tuition
for night school.

00:38.905 --> 00:41.874
AJ:
<i>Ah, this is nice.</i>

00:41.874 --> 00:44.811
When was the last time the three
of us hung out like this, huh?

00:44.811 --> 00:47.547
Well, you don't
drink anymore.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.615
Well, I don't need booze
to enjoy your insecurity.

00:49.615 --> 00:51.217
Thank you?
(chuckles)

00:51.217 --> 00:52.785
RUSS:
Wow.

00:52.785 --> 00:54.787
What do you say we get the
kids together this weekend?

00:54.787 --> 00:57.323
Uh, can't this weekend.
We're going to see Lina's mom.

00:57.323 --> 00:59.292
How's Janice doing?

00:59.292 --> 01:01.928
Eh, she's starting
to get a little confused.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.896
Well, I'll tell you what--
it's only a matter of time

01:03.896 --> 01:05.898
till Shep loses his marbles.

01:05.898 --> 01:07.500
AJ: He's not that old.
RUSS: Exactly.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.836
Shep's got way more
brain cells than AJ does.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.472
Totally.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.140
Whatever.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.808
Are you guys Shep's friends
or my friends?

01:15.808 --> 01:18.678
Geez.
We didn't know that we
needed to make a choice.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.580
What's going on?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.582
Every time we walk
into a preschool,

01:22.582 --> 01:24.250
I know what these bitches
are thinking.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.587
Oh, successful man,
dumb trophy wife.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.756
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, you're
a smart trophy wife.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.390
Well...
AJ: If there were a
Miss Trophy Wife,

01:31.390 --> 01:33.860
you would definitely win
the intelligence portion.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.728
(chuckles)
Thank you.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.930
Where, uh, where are you
guys applying anyway?

01:37.930 --> 01:39.932
Hillside.
AJ:
Hillside?!

01:39.932 --> 01:41.434
Yeah.
That's where
my kid went.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.835
We love it there.
You should drop my name.

01:42.835 --> 01:45.404
Yeah, I would.

01:45.404 --> 01:47.640
It's just that I would
actually like to get in.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.742
What is that supposed to mean?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.311
Nothing.
(chuckles)

01:52.311 --> 01:54.247
Trust me.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.581
You should be...
(chuckles)

01:55.581 --> 01:56.916
trusting a napkin.

01:56.916 --> 01:57.917
(laughs)

02:03.890 --> 02:05.424
Wow.

02:05.424 --> 02:06.759
This place is awesome.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.331
It's really remote.

02:12.331 --> 02:14.300
I don't know why he
keeps moving her around.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.302
It's not gonna help
her confusion.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.804
Don't start.
Start what?

02:17.804 --> 02:19.338
Picking on Ed.

02:19.338 --> 02:21.340
I'm not picking on
the new husband.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.409
They've been married
as long as we have, okay?

02:23.409 --> 02:25.278
You should start
calling him Ed.

02:25.278 --> 02:27.180
Ed.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.481
Ed. Ed.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.849
Ed... I-I don't know.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.384
New husband's just
easier to remember.

02:31.384 --> 02:32.718
(scoffs)

02:34.287 --> 02:37.290
Ugh, this place is beautiful.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.625
I'd like to retire
in a place like this someday.

02:39.625 --> 02:41.627
Retirement's
just for men.

02:41.627 --> 02:43.496
No, it's not-- women retire.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.832
I mean, they used to, but then
some asshole invented Viagra,

02:45.832 --> 02:48.334
and now it's never over.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.203
Well, I don't want it
to be over.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.871
I know, sweetie.

02:51.871 --> 02:52.872
I know.

02:54.473 --> 02:55.808
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

02:55.808 --> 02:57.343
You made it.
FRANKIE: Hi!

02:57.343 --> 02:58.678
Oh, my God!

02:58.678 --> 02:59.812
Give me a hug.
(laughs)

02:59.812 --> 03:00.813
Hey there.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.349
Mom, hi.
Oh.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.219
Oh, I missed you.
(chuckles)

03:06.219 --> 03:08.921
Oh, my God, it smells
so good in here.

03:08.921 --> 03:11.357
Are you cooking?
(chuckles)

03:11.357 --> 03:12.859
We're going out
for dinner tonight.
Oh, very funny.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.528
What restaurant is open
Thanksgiving? Chinese?

03:15.528 --> 03:16.863
Don't be silly.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.731
But, Mom, it's not, um...

03:18.731 --> 03:20.600
Cold enough to be
Thanksgiving, I know.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.901
This weather's crazy,
isn't it?

03:21.901 --> 03:23.836
JANICE: You know me,
I love the holidays.

03:23.836 --> 03:26.239
Listen, when I told her
you were coming today,

03:26.239 --> 03:27.573
she got confused.

03:27.573 --> 03:29.141
She thought
it was Thanksgiving.

03:29.141 --> 03:30.376
Did you tell her
it wasn't?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.378
I did--
just made her angry.

03:36.515 --> 03:38.517
Oh, my God.

03:38.517 --> 03:39.852
What are we gonna do?

03:39.852 --> 03:43.189
I think we enjoy
the holiday.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.191
Turkey smells
great, Janice.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.329
WOMAN: <i>And this is</i>
<i>Mrs. Sawyer's classroom.</i>

03:50.329 --> 03:53.199
Oh, Mrs. Sawyer.
(chuckles)

03:53.199 --> 03:54.834
Harrison's gonna
love it here.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.703
He's three; he'll love it
anywhere they have juice.

03:57.703 --> 04:00.239
Can you just...

04:00.239 --> 04:01.507
So does Harrison have
any siblings?

04:01.507 --> 04:02.909
Uh, I-I have a
15-year-old son.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.277
Yeah.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.611
Yes, but I'm
the first wife.

04:05.611 --> 04:06.779
I'm the only wife.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.381
(both chuckle
uncomfortably)

04:08.381 --> 04:10.149
And I went to Cornell.

04:10.149 --> 04:11.651
Mmm... she...
So, you know...

04:11.651 --> 04:13.319
doesn't need to know...
I'm not dumb.

04:14.353 --> 04:16.756
Okay.
(Jess chuckles)

04:16.756 --> 04:19.525
Ha... Did I mention that
Harrison can already count

04:19.525 --> 04:21.294
to <i>trece en espaĂąol?</i>

04:21.294 --> 04:22.795
That's amazing.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.932
Uh, what's amazing is
our nanny's actually Polish.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.333
So, uh...

04:27.333 --> 04:31.337
Listen, every child
is right for Hillside,

04:31.337 --> 04:33.406
but not every parent is
right for Hillside.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.341
Okay, that takes care of that.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.542
Mmm.
(chuckles):
Look.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.544
There's an open house
here tonight.

04:38.544 --> 04:41.614
It's a chance to meet parents,
alums, make some connections.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.848
Yeah, we'll be there.

04:42.848 --> 04:44.250
Great.
Great.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.551
Because we really do care

04:45.551 --> 04:47.253
about our little community here.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.455
You don't know anyone
in the Hillside family, do you?

04:51.524 --> 04:53.693
Not a soul.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.463
I thought you said
AJ's kid went here.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.265
Yeah. I know
what I'm doing.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.334
Okay, I'll
just shut up.
Okay.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.703
I'm the one who already
raised a kid,

05:03.703 --> 05:05.371
but why should that matter?

05:05.371 --> 05:07.773
I'll just shut up.
Yeah, do so.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.148
I knew she was starting
to forget stuff,

05:16.148 --> 05:17.783
but, like, she
was still my mom.

05:17.783 --> 05:19.418
Now, every time
I see her,

05:19.418 --> 05:21.220
she's just gonna be
less and less herself.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.322
I'm sorry. It sucks.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.925
Goddamn it. I just finished
changing all the kids' diapers,

05:25.925 --> 05:27.893
and now I'll change my mom's?

05:27.893 --> 05:29.795
I know. It's the
diaper sandwich.

05:29.795 --> 05:32.398
(whispering):
My diaper sandwich
was this thin.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.400
Diaper Panini?

05:35.801 --> 05:37.670
Look, at least
we have Ed, right?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.405
I mean, he'll
get in there.
Will he?

05:39.405 --> 05:41.440
LINA: How well do we
really know this guy?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.376
RUSS: Oh, my God.
14 years well.

05:45.711 --> 05:48.547
Maybe my mom should come
and live with us.

05:48.547 --> 05:52.251
I mean, I don't...
I don't know.

05:52.251 --> 05:53.452
Yeah, right?
I don't think so.

05:53.452 --> 05:54.787
I mean, why not?

05:54.787 --> 05:56.722
I think she'd be
so confused there.

05:56.722 --> 05:59.592
And I feel like Ed has
everything under control here.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.761
We're about to have
Thanksgiving in September.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.763
Nothing is under control.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.631
I'll talk to Ed, okay?
You will?

06:05.631 --> 06:07.533
And make sure
everything is okay.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.904
Hey, so... just curious
about Janice.

06:11.904 --> 06:14.440
Uh, Lina's pretty worried
about her.
Yeah.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.675
Yeah, she's getting
real dingy,

06:16.675 --> 06:18.644
but she still
has her good days.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.813
Right. Yeah, no.

06:20.813 --> 06:23.549
We were just kind of wondering
what the long-term plan was,

06:23.549 --> 06:25.484
you know, for when
things get a little

06:25.484 --> 06:27.753
harder for you
to deal with.

06:27.753 --> 06:30.222
Sunset Ranch has
a memory unit.

06:30.222 --> 06:32.358
Doctors 24/7,
physical therapy.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.560
One of the main reasons
I brought her here.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.562
Oh, so she'll be
staying here?

06:36.562 --> 06:38.697
Oh, definitely.
Oh, that's great.

06:38.697 --> 06:41.233
This place is top flight,
baby. Top flight.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.736
Great doctors,
great everything.

06:46.205 --> 06:48.707
(grunting)

06:48.707 --> 06:51.143
Russ, my boy.

06:51.143 --> 06:52.478
Really?

06:52.478 --> 06:54.146
Wow.
Wear it with pride.

06:54.146 --> 06:56.148
I will. Thank you.
(laughs)

06:56.148 --> 06:57.550
I feel honored.

06:57.550 --> 07:00.820
Over here, you got your
fitness center, weight room,

07:00.820 --> 07:01.854
pool...

07:01.854 --> 07:04.356
RUSS:
And everything is included?

07:04.356 --> 07:05.825
Everything.
Wow.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.760
I wouldn't mind retiring
to a place like this.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.563
They cook for you,
clean, garden.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.364
That's incredible.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.504
Uh... oh, are you sure?

07:18.504 --> 07:19.905
It's noon.

07:19.905 --> 07:21.507
It's retirement.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.275
(laughs)
(laughs):
Okay.

07:23.275 --> 07:26.745
You know, I never saw myself
ending up in a place like this.

07:26.745 --> 07:29.181
I'm not exactly your retirement
community type of guy.

07:29.181 --> 07:31.717
Yeah, yeah.
Check this out.

07:32.918 --> 07:35.354
(Ed laughs)
RUSS: No way.

07:35.354 --> 07:36.922
You serious?

07:36.922 --> 07:38.724
Can't say no
to that, can you?

07:38.724 --> 07:40.493
Wow. No.
That sold it right there.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.261
Artillio is
our hidden gem.

07:42.261 --> 07:43.863
He does plumbing,
electrical,

07:43.863 --> 07:45.898
drives to
the all-night pharmacy.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.867
Whatever you need,
he'll take care of it.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.435
For you, seĂąor.
Oh, thank you.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.637
(speaking Spanish)

07:51.637 --> 07:53.572
Yeah. Huh?

07:53.572 --> 07:55.641
(laughs)
Retirement is awesome.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.742
Yeah. (laughs)

07:58.744 --> 08:01.413
SHEPARD: <i>No, I don't think</i>
<i>he needs tutoring.</i>

08:01.413 --> 08:04.383
Well, Russ and Lina's girls
all had bigger vocabularies

08:04.383 --> 08:06.152
when they were his age.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.521
Yeah, 'cause
they're girls.
So?

08:08.521 --> 08:11.257
Boys don't talk as much, because
they know there's no point.

08:11.257 --> 08:12.858
(laughs): Oh.
(knocking)

08:12.858 --> 08:14.393
(Jess gasps)
Oh. Hey.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.228
You didn't drop my name.

08:16.228 --> 08:17.696
Oh, great.
Well, how does he
know this already?

08:17.696 --> 08:19.198
(door closes)
Well, don't freak out.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.499
(clicks tongue)

08:20.499 --> 08:22.835
You didn't drop my name.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.503
What?
At Hillside.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.805
I told you to drop my name,
and you didn't drop it.

08:26.805 --> 08:28.307
JESS:
You know, actually,

08:28.307 --> 08:29.875
I'm pretty sure
we dropped it.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.610
You're pretty sure?

08:32.811 --> 08:34.613
Yeah.

08:34.613 --> 08:35.748
I think I dropped it.

08:35.748 --> 08:36.882
You think you dropped it?

08:36.882 --> 08:39.351
Uh-huh.

08:39.351 --> 08:42.521
Did she drop it or not?

08:42.521 --> 08:44.890
We didn't drop it.
Come on.

08:44.890 --> 08:47.593
I'm sorry. Look,

08:47.593 --> 08:49.195
we really want
to get into Hillside,

08:49.195 --> 08:50.729
and we don't want
any of your issues

08:50.729 --> 08:52.598
getting in
the way, okay?
My issues?

08:52.598 --> 08:54.600
Mm-hmm.
What issues are you
talking about exactly?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.603
Drugs, alcohol, sex addiction,

08:57.603 --> 09:00.372
uh, amnesia,
public defecation.

09:00.372 --> 09:03.242
I forgot where the bathroom was.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.211
Amnesia!

09:05.211 --> 09:07.346
You know what?
You're right.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.682
I have had a lot of issues.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.584
That's all I'm saying.
I'm not even trying

09:11.584 --> 09:13.485
to make you feel bad.
I'm just saying.

09:13.485 --> 09:15.588
AJ: You got a real point.
I-I'm a liability.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.556
Nobody should drop my name.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.625
The smartest thing
that you could've done was

09:19.625 --> 09:20.893
pretend like you don't know me.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.562
So you're not mad?

09:23.562 --> 09:25.331
I get it.
Okay.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.766
You're just trying
to do what's best for your kid.

09:27.766 --> 09:29.401
You don't know me.

09:29.401 --> 09:31.270
Well, exactly, yeah.
Yes!

09:31.270 --> 09:33.839
I wanted to drop it.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.141
LINA:
<i>So how are you guys doing?</i>

09:36.141 --> 09:38.777
Your father takes
good care of me.
He's not my father.

09:38.777 --> 09:41.280
Oh, you might have your
differences, but he'll always be

09:41.280 --> 09:42.615
your father.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.183
Mom, Ed's your second husband.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.818
You guys got married in 2003.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.519
(chuckles):
I have two husbands?

09:47.519 --> 09:48.887
Dad left, remember?

09:48.887 --> 09:50.489
Yes, of course
I remember.

09:50.489 --> 09:53.292
He left with Russ
to get the cranberry sauce.

09:53.292 --> 09:55.494
Do you have anything
for a migraine?

09:55.494 --> 09:57.630
Check the bathroom.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.303
(whispers):
Okay.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.648
(gasps)

10:19.935 --> 10:22.371
(golf cart whirring)

10:22.371 --> 10:24.706
Um...

10:25.874 --> 10:27.909
What?

10:27.909 --> 10:29.945
My mom's moving
in with us.

10:29.945 --> 10:31.913
No.
Yes.

10:31.913 --> 10:34.015
No. Sweetie,
this is a great place.

10:34.015 --> 10:39.254
They have doctors here for her
and-and handymen and recreation.

10:39.254 --> 10:40.689
I mean,
we should move here.

10:40.689 --> 10:41.823
Lube.

10:41.823 --> 10:42.824
Yeah, I know what that is.

10:42.824 --> 10:44.426
For sex.
Yup.

10:44.426 --> 10:47.662
My mom and Ed
are still doing it.

10:47.662 --> 10:49.698
Yeah. They're married.

10:49.698 --> 10:51.533
She has dementia!

10:51.533 --> 10:53.468
Well, that's why
she's at the Sunset Ranch.

10:53.468 --> 10:55.003
I mean, this is
a great facility.

10:55.003 --> 10:56.738
She doesn't remember
my dad leaving her.

10:56.738 --> 10:58.740
That's great.

10:58.740 --> 11:01.443
Russ, she thinks
that Ed is my dad.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.378
She doesn't know who
she's having sex with.

11:03.378 --> 11:07.282
Well... in sickness
and in health, right?

11:07.282 --> 11:09.317
What are you talking about?!
He's taking advantage of her!

11:09.317 --> 11:10.786
Nuh-uh.
Yes!

11:10.786 --> 11:12.487
Look, what if... what
if I was out of it?

11:12.487 --> 11:13.789
What if I was a vegetable?

11:13.789 --> 11:15.991
Then I'd become a vegetarian.

11:15.991 --> 11:17.359
(groans)
No.

11:17.359 --> 11:18.660
I am shutting
this shit down.

11:18.660 --> 11:19.828
No, you are not.

11:19.828 --> 11:21.630
Well, one of us is.
(knocking)

11:21.630 --> 11:23.231
Just need my duffel.

11:23.231 --> 11:24.599
Time to hit the weights.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.469
(whispers):
Go with him.

11:27.469 --> 11:28.537
(whispers):
No.

11:28.537 --> 11:29.704
(whispers):
Go.

11:31.306 --> 11:34.543
Hey, Ed, you mind
if I, uh, join you?

11:41.416 --> 11:43.418
So, you, uh, you've been
working out a lot, huh?

11:43.418 --> 11:44.986
Use it or lose it.

11:44.986 --> 11:46.721
Yeah, although sometimes

11:46.721 --> 11:48.390
it's probably better
to lose it, right?

11:48.390 --> 11:49.825
You know?

11:49.825 --> 11:51.660
No, I just...

11:51.660 --> 11:53.628
I mean, there are just...
(clears throat)

11:53.628 --> 11:54.996
certain parts of our bodies

11:54.996 --> 11:56.598
that we're probably
better off

11:56.598 --> 11:58.300
forgetting about, right?

11:58.300 --> 11:59.935
I don't think that's true.

11:59.935 --> 12:01.937
No, I mean, I think
it is, you know?

12:01.937 --> 12:06.007
I just think when you're older,
you know, you should...

12:06.007 --> 12:08.477
shouldn't, you
know, maybe using

12:08.477 --> 12:10.846
certain parts of your body.

12:10.846 --> 12:13.949
You know, maybe your,
uh, your pelvic region

12:13.949 --> 12:16.451
and your hips...

12:16.451 --> 12:18.887
the old flexors,
the-the butt...

12:18.887 --> 12:21.423
What do you mean?
I'm trying to say

12:21.423 --> 12:23.225
if your partner, you know,
doesn't want to use

12:23.225 --> 12:25.994
their pelvic region, um...

12:25.994 --> 12:29.297
you know, just, whatever,
because they're tired

12:29.297 --> 12:31.333
or they're older...

12:31.333 --> 12:32.968
can't remember
their name, whatever--

12:32.968 --> 12:35.370
I don't know-- you know,
for whatever reason,

12:35.370 --> 12:36.805
you should probably
just match the usage,

12:36.805 --> 12:38.373
you know, of your partner?

12:38.373 --> 12:39.708
I'm gonna stop you now.

12:41.877 --> 12:44.279
You're really doing a number
on your back here.

12:44.279 --> 12:45.747
It's not safe. Step out.

12:45.747 --> 12:47.349
Okay.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.218
First, you got to
set it for some...

12:50.218 --> 12:51.553
man-sized setting
on the weights.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.688
Yeah.
(sighs)

12:53.688 --> 12:55.524
Okay, you want
to use your power.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.460
(grunts)
Like that.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.762
Force! You want
to spread them wide.

13:00.762 --> 13:02.364
Spread them wide.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.798
Pound it harder!

13:03.798 --> 13:05.800
Jesus, man.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.436
Yeah. I used to box
a little bit.

13:08.436 --> 13:09.638
We could spar if you want.

13:09.638 --> 13:11.773
No, I'm good.
(laughs)

13:11.773 --> 13:13.875
All right, boy.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.386
These gravy boats
are yours when I go.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.688
Don't let my sister take them.

13:26.688 --> 13:29.257
Mom, what do you think
about living with us?

13:29.257 --> 13:30.792
That's sweet.

13:30.792 --> 13:32.661
But your father and I
need our privacy.
(groans)

13:32.661 --> 13:34.629
(sighs)

13:34.629 --> 13:35.864
I found the lube, Mom.

13:35.864 --> 13:37.399
It's over.
What?

13:37.399 --> 13:38.967
I know you guys have been
making whoopee,

13:38.967 --> 13:40.802
or whatever you want to call it.

13:40.802 --> 13:42.404
What your father
and I do in private

13:42.404 --> 13:44.272
is none of your business.
Mom!

13:44.272 --> 13:46.374
He's not my father!
You don't even remember

13:46.374 --> 13:48.343
his name!
Whose name?

13:48.343 --> 13:49.844
The guy you're
having sex with, Mom.

13:49.844 --> 13:50.879
Say his name.

13:50.879 --> 13:52.714
His name...

13:52.714 --> 13:54.382
is my husband!

13:54.382 --> 13:55.951
Yes.

13:55.951 --> 13:57.686
There are things I
get confused about,

13:57.686 --> 13:59.788
but who I share my bed
with is not one of them.

13:59.788 --> 14:03.358
Now, if you don't mind, I would
like to enjoy the holiday

14:03.358 --> 14:05.493
with my grandchildren
and my incredible husband.

14:05.493 --> 14:07.796
Whose name is...?

14:07.796 --> 14:08.897
(grunts)

14:08.897 --> 14:10.465
Just what's
the first name

14:10.465 --> 14:11.967
that's coming to your mind
right now?

14:11.967 --> 14:13.969
Mom?

14:13.969 --> 14:16.938
So, we're a play-first
institution, and we were

14:16.938 --> 14:19.341
an early adopter of
the children's bill of rights.

14:19.341 --> 14:21.676
Mm, kids need rights.

14:21.676 --> 14:22.744
Mm.

14:22.744 --> 14:24.279
So true, so true.

14:24.279 --> 14:25.413
She says that all the time.

14:25.413 --> 14:27.315
"Kids need rights."

14:27.315 --> 14:28.950
Can you excuse us for a moment?
Yeah, sure, sure.

14:28.950 --> 14:30.418
Lovely to meet you, Gladys.
Okay.

14:30.418 --> 14:32.721
Of course, yes.
You, too.
Uh-huh.

14:34.589 --> 14:36.591
What are you doing here?

14:36.591 --> 14:38.460
Do I know you?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.729
(chuckles): Okay.
AJ.

14:40.729 --> 14:42.697
Hmm. We don't know
each other, remember?

14:42.697 --> 14:44.699
This is super weird.

14:44.699 --> 14:46.368
Can you not
mess this up for us?

14:46.368 --> 14:48.637
You said that it would
be better for you

14:48.637 --> 14:50.405
to pretend that
you don't know me.

14:50.405 --> 14:52.540
Well, then I don't
know you either.

14:52.540 --> 14:54.275
Okay, this is
a really intense move...

14:54.275 --> 14:55.877
Oh, great.
I see you guys met AJ.

14:55.877 --> 14:57.646
He's one of our all-star donors.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.481
Yeah.
(chuckles)
Oh, you're a donor?

14:59.481 --> 15:01.349
Big-time donor.

15:01.349 --> 15:02.951
SHEPARD:
Is that right?
Yeah.

15:02.951 --> 15:04.986
Interesting.
Mm-hmm.

15:04.986 --> 15:07.622
So you guys know each other
or you don't?

15:07.622 --> 15:09.858
He... he's just trying
to give us a hard time.

15:09.858 --> 15:12.227
We've never met actually.

15:12.227 --> 15:14.829
AJ.
I'm sorry, you just
don't look familiar to me.

15:14.829 --> 15:16.798
But maybe I've forgotten you.

15:16.798 --> 15:18.867
You see, I've been
having some issues lately.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.770
Now, if you excuse me, I see
a friend of mine over there.

15:21.770 --> 15:23.938
A real friend.
(chuckles)

15:23.938 --> 15:26.541
Sure.
Excuse me.

15:26.541 --> 15:27.976
We should've
dropped his name.

15:27.976 --> 15:29.377
Okay.

15:29.377 --> 15:32.414
Not gonna say it again.

15:32.414 --> 15:34.416
We should've
dropped his name.
There it is.

15:36.551 --> 15:38.653
LINA: Is it done?
Did you do the thing?

15:38.653 --> 15:40.255
RUSS:
No. I tried to, but...

15:40.255 --> 15:42.390
did you know that
Ed was a boxer?

15:42.390 --> 15:43.725
You think he hits her, too?

15:43.725 --> 15:45.894
Not what I was saying.

15:45.894 --> 15:47.929
LINA: Well, okay, she's leaving
with us right now. Okay.
RUSS: No, no, no.

15:47.929 --> 15:50.331
I'm gonna go pack her bag,
because...
Hold on, hold on, stop.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.468
I got an idea.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.809
Lina, this
is Artillio.

16:00.809 --> 16:03.445
He is one of Sunset
Ranch's hidden gems.

16:03.445 --> 16:04.746
What do I fix?

16:05.814 --> 16:07.282
He's your idea?

16:07.282 --> 16:09.250
Yeah. Watch this.

16:12.654 --> 16:14.522
Cheers.
Thank you.

16:15.790 --> 16:18.393
Now tell him about
your dad's lube.

16:18.393 --> 16:21.229
Stepdad's lube.

16:21.229 --> 16:22.664
My real dad left us.

16:22.664 --> 16:24.532
Oh, so sorry.
Would you excuse us

16:24.532 --> 16:26.334
for a second, please?
Thank you.

16:27.969 --> 16:29.804
How is he supposed to help?

16:29.804 --> 16:32.741
I don't know-- maybe he,
you know, talks to Ed,

16:32.741 --> 16:34.743
tells him to keep
it in his pants,

16:34.743 --> 16:36.911
or maybe he finds someone
else for Ed to bang.

16:36.911 --> 16:39.981
You want me to explain
to a handyman that Ed is raping

16:39.981 --> 16:41.883
my shell of a mother?

16:41.883 --> 16:43.852
Artillio is assistant
facilities manager.

16:43.852 --> 16:45.787
Excuse me,
Mr. Russ.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.256
I go fix the broken sinks
in the villas. But I come back.

16:48.256 --> 16:49.824
Okay, great.

16:54.362 --> 16:57.298
This guy's the best.

16:57.298 --> 16:59.000
You're an idiot.

17:04.672 --> 17:06.541
AJ, please, we're sorry.
Please don't do this.

17:06.541 --> 17:07.909
You know how important
this is to us.

17:07.909 --> 17:09.477
Really.
Please.
It's just a shame

17:09.477 --> 17:10.979
that we don't know
each other anymore.

17:10.979 --> 17:12.280
Please.
Come on, man. You know what?

17:12.280 --> 17:13.848
This-this is not a joke.

17:15.350 --> 17:17.318
It's already
done. He's in.

17:17.318 --> 17:18.853
I took care of it.

17:18.853 --> 17:21.389
Harrison's in?
What do you mean? He's in?

17:21.389 --> 17:24.225
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

17:24.225 --> 17:25.994
Thank you, thank you.
Thanks. That means...

17:25.994 --> 17:27.395
That...
Oh, thank you.
So much.

17:27.395 --> 17:29.264
This means
a lot to her.
Yeah.

17:29.264 --> 17:30.999
Hey, you're welcome.
You're welcome.
Thank you.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.534
Can I just have a moment?
You're welcome.

17:32.534 --> 17:33.968
Yeah, absolutely.

17:33.968 --> 17:35.970
Thank you.
Thank you.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.910
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.912
No matter how bad things got,

17:43.912 --> 17:46.247
I have always
been there for my kid.

17:46.247 --> 17:47.515
I know.

17:47.515 --> 17:50.218
School, sports,
I go to everything.

17:50.218 --> 17:54.389
I may be a screwup,
but I am not a bad parent.

17:54.389 --> 17:56.357
That makes one of us.
You know?

17:56.357 --> 17:57.859
Shep's great at being a parent.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.795
I don't even know
if I'm cut out for it.

18:00.795 --> 18:01.896
(sputters)

18:01.896 --> 18:03.731
What? What does that mean?

18:05.266 --> 18:07.802
Maybe I'm not
supposed to be a mother.

18:09.370 --> 18:11.339
(girls laughing)

18:11.339 --> 18:13.641
How do you do it?

18:13.641 --> 18:16.344
RUSS:
Oh, are you full?
Yeah.

18:16.344 --> 18:17.412
Me, too.

18:20.715 --> 18:22.283
Can we talk
for a second?

18:22.283 --> 18:23.852
Uh, yeah. Sure.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.887
I understand you have
some concerns

18:25.887 --> 18:27.488
about me and your mom.

18:31.359 --> 18:33.795
Well, I-I... I... Yeah.

18:33.795 --> 18:36.397
I guess... I do, I...
I get it.

18:36.397 --> 18:38.499
I'm not your father.
Uh-uh.

18:38.499 --> 18:40.535
And I'm not trying to be.

18:40.535 --> 18:43.805
But you need to understand
that I love Janice

18:43.805 --> 18:46.507
and I would never do
anything to hurt her.

18:46.507 --> 18:48.943
LINA:
I know that.

18:48.943 --> 18:51.579
But from my point of view...

18:51.579 --> 18:55.483
I-I know, it's... weird
to think about me being

18:55.483 --> 18:56.584
with your mom.

18:56.584 --> 18:57.752
Yeah, I don't...

18:57.752 --> 19:00.488
See, we still connect.

19:00.488 --> 19:03.791
And, uh, there's
some days when

19:03.791 --> 19:05.760
she forgets my name.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.896
It's okay.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.964
She knows that I love her.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.869
Can I help with some
of these dishes?

19:14.869 --> 19:17.272
Uh, yeah.

19:17.272 --> 19:19.240
LINA: Oh, I can...
I can get it.
ED: Oh, no, no, no.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.509
(mouths)

19:23.311 --> 19:25.580
(girls laughing)

19:25.580 --> 19:27.615
No, do it in the
strings, Mom.

19:27.615 --> 19:29.250
Mom, thank you.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.485
That was really delicious.

19:30.485 --> 19:31.753
It was. Cheers.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.488
You still got it.
I'm just so grateful

19:33.488 --> 19:35.356
that we're all together.
I could eat that whole pie

19:35.356 --> 19:37.392
and that one
and this one
(knock at window)

19:37.392 --> 19:39.494
and that one.
ED: No, really?

19:39.494 --> 19:41.763
Yes!
Wow.

19:41.763 --> 19:45.667
ED: Really great pie
this time, hon.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.001
JANICE:
Does Froggy like the pie?

19:47.001 --> 19:48.903
ED:
Pi is, like, 3.14, isn't it?

19:50.338 --> 19:51.806
Hi.
Hi.

19:51.806 --> 19:54.275
So sorry to bother
you, but we got

19:54.275 --> 19:56.744
a call about
a potential elder abuse.

19:56.744 --> 19:58.947
Um...
Um...

19:58.947 --> 20:01.282
Can we, uh... could we
do this another time?

20:01.282 --> 20:03.284
Yeah, we're kind of in the
middle of Thanksgiving, so...

20:03.284 --> 20:04.886
Yeah.
We're required to
do an interview.

20:04.886 --> 20:06.988
All our employees
are mandatory reporters.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.457
Artillio called
us because

20:09.457 --> 20:10.825
you expressed concern.

20:10.825 --> 20:12.427
Just like they tell us
in seminar.

20:12.427 --> 20:15.396
No. That was
a misunderstanding.

20:15.396 --> 20:16.698
Yeah.
That was a mix-up.

20:16.698 --> 20:18.299
I think...
Probably a language...

20:18.299 --> 20:19.834
I think, yeah, sometimes
it's hard to understand

20:19.834 --> 20:21.869
Artillio.
It was also mentioned

20:21.869 --> 20:24.872
that your father
sexually assaulted your mother.

20:24.872 --> 20:26.841
ARTILLIO:
No, no.
Wow.

20:26.841 --> 20:28.876
He is the stepfather.
Her real father left.

20:28.876 --> 20:30.478
That's...
That is true, but-but I think

20:30.478 --> 20:32.380
you're misunderstanding...
I did s... Yeah.

20:32.380 --> 20:34.282
Yeah, that's not...
Hey, Artillio,
what's going on?

20:34.282 --> 20:35.850
Is everything okay?
You know what,
I think there's been

20:35.850 --> 20:37.852
a little confusion
here, so...

20:37.852 --> 20:38.853
No, no confusion.

20:38.853 --> 20:39.954
Miss Lina say you

20:39.954 --> 20:41.723
rape you

20:41.723 --> 20:42.824
with lube.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.492
LINA:
That is ridiculous!

20:44.492 --> 20:46.394
My stepfather-- I'm sorry,

20:46.394 --> 20:48.329
I'm gonna go with
"father" right now--

20:48.329 --> 20:50.798
my father wouldn't
rape anybody.
RUSS: Yeah.

20:50.798 --> 20:52.500
He's a really good man.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.435
Yeah. I know rapers, and
this guy is not a raper.
Yeah.

20:54.435 --> 20:55.937
LINA:
No. What rapist

20:55.937 --> 20:57.405
uses lube?
What are you even...

20:57.405 --> 20:58.706
Lube is the
opposite of rape.

20:58.706 --> 21:00.441
LINA: What are you
talking about?

21:00.441 --> 21:02.243
RUSS: Yeah, we've got a family
thing going on here, okay,

21:02.243 --> 21:03.644
so could you just let us
enjoy the holiday, please?

21:03.644 --> 21:04.912
There's children in there.
I don't like them even

21:04.912 --> 21:07.482
hearing this.
That's unbelievable.

21:07.482 --> 21:09.650
Happy Thanksgiving to you both.

21:13.488 --> 21:15.990
Look.

21:15.990 --> 21:17.325
This belonged to
Ed's grandmother.
Really?

21:17.325 --> 21:18.459
Yeah.
Wow.

21:18.459 --> 21:19.627
He wanted to pass it on

21:19.627 --> 21:21.295
to one of our girls.

21:21.295 --> 21:22.663
Oh, that's so nice.

21:22.663 --> 21:24.465
He refers to them as
his granddaughters.

21:24.465 --> 21:26.501
Well...
It's sweet.

21:26.501 --> 21:28.336
Which girl are you
gonna give it to?

21:28.336 --> 21:29.537
This one.

21:30.738 --> 21:32.273
It's real gold.

21:32.273 --> 21:33.975
Good call.

21:33.975 --> 21:37.445
When I'm old and out of it,

21:37.445 --> 21:39.614
I want someone like Ed
to take care of me.

21:39.614 --> 21:41.516
Aw, don't worry, babe.

21:41.516 --> 21:43.251
I'll be riding you
into the sunset.

21:43.251 --> 21:44.786
Oh, you're so romantic.

21:44.786 --> 21:45.887
(chuckles)

21:45.887 --> 21:48.689
Mommy, what's rape?
