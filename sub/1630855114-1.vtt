03:17.632 --> 03:20.722
-911. What's your emergency?

03:20.765 --> 03:24.769
-Please. Please send someone.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.771
-Tell me what's going on,
ma'am.

03:29.034 --> 03:32.168
-Just send someone.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.215
-Deputies are already on
the way, ma'am. Are you hurt?

03:37.434 --> 03:40.307
-I don't know.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.874
I-I have to get out.

04:01.328 --> 04:04.374
-Ma'am, are you still there?

04:04.418 --> 04:06.158
-I can't get out.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.558
He could still be here.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.331
-Found her sitting in
the middle of the room.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.028
-Which room?

04:50.072 --> 04:51.595
-The bad one.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.294
-The bad one?

04:54.337 --> 04:55.947
Is she hurt?

04:55.991 --> 04:59.734
-Medic says she's pretty
dehydrated, but fine otherwise.

04:59.777 --> 05:03.128
It's someone else's blood.

05:03.172 --> 05:06.436
We haven't been able
to ID her yet.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.438
-Loewen.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.961
-Sorry?

05:10.005 --> 05:12.050
-Her name is Cora Loewen.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.798
Hey, Cora.

05:21.886 --> 05:25.020
You need anything? You want
some water or something?

05:39.948 --> 05:42.254
Can you tell me what happened?

05:48.652 --> 05:51.176
Can you tell me whose blood
is all over you?

05:55.267 --> 05:57.357
-I just wanted him back.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.843
He told me
we could get him back.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.586
-Who told you?

06:13.416 --> 06:16.027
-I really thought
that we could get him back.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.162
-No.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.733
Cora.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.215
It's been seven years.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.166
-Wyatt.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.430
Wyatt! Wyatt.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.216
Hey! Wake up.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.175
You got to help me hide
all this shit.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.525
Fuck.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.884
-Are you Noah Loewen's mother?

07:31.755 --> 07:33.409
-What is this?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.847
-Do you know where
your son is, Ms. Loewen?

07:36.891 --> 07:39.676
-Yeah, of course.
Of course I do.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.373
Okay. What the fuck is this?

07:41.417 --> 07:42.853
-We're just following up on
the welfare check, ma'am.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.334
-Can you just go confirm
that he's here, please?

08:11.012 --> 08:13.971
-Center 15 send two.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.321
That's a negative
at the residence.

08:55.143 --> 09:02.498
-The pain of losing someone
close to us can feel unbearable.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.893
Loneliness, helplessness.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.808
Just a feeling that
no one else

09:07.851 --> 09:11.376
on the planet Earth could
possibly understand.

09:11.420 --> 09:15.337
And yet everyone in this circle
has felt that way

09:15.380 --> 09:19.341
to one degree or another
at some point.

09:19.384 --> 09:23.519
And just to have the courage
to sit in this room,

09:23.563 --> 09:27.610
to be here together,
for this kind of healing,

09:27.654 --> 09:32.528
that is the first step
toward taking back control.

09:34.748 --> 09:38.926
Just gives me this warm feeling
in my heart knowing that it

09:38.969 --> 09:41.537
might give you just
a tiny bit of comfort

09:41.581 --> 09:43.800
to hear it and to share it.

09:43.844 --> 09:47.325
Because having this group
has given

09:47.369 --> 09:49.066
the loss of my Beverly a meaning

09:49.110 --> 09:51.112
that I just never thought
would have been possible.

09:51.155 --> 09:54.550
And I owe that to everyone.

09:54.594 --> 09:59.076
All right, well, we got pivot
to Thursday for next week

09:59.120 --> 10:04.865
because bingo
has the room reserved.

10:04.908 --> 10:09.130
All right.
Thanks for coming, you guys.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.480
-Today is his birthday.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.533
Or...

10:21.577 --> 10:24.667
it would have been.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.930
It would have been his birthday.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.809
I've never really shared here.

10:39.116 --> 10:42.554
I think because I thought that
just by coming,

10:42.598 --> 10:46.776
I was somehow
moving forward or

10:46.820 --> 10:50.127
working towards something.

10:50.171 --> 10:53.957
Healing. Maybe. I don't know.

10:56.090 --> 11:00.224
Looking for an answer
to a question, I guess.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.534
I think I might have just been
kidding myself.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.061
There probably isn't an answer.

11:14.848 --> 11:19.417
But I search and I search
for that thing.

11:19.461 --> 11:23.030
You know, that little thing
that just might help

11:23.073 --> 11:26.729
trigger something
or help me remember.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.253
But there's just nothing.

11:32.822 --> 11:36.173
There's just staying high.

11:36.217 --> 11:39.307
That is all there fucking was.

11:42.005 --> 11:44.747
And I didn't care what
anybody did to me

11:44.791 --> 11:49.099
or what anybody took from me
as long as I was high.

11:52.581 --> 11:55.540
And I promised myself
that I would be sober

11:55.584 --> 11:58.630
when he came back to me.

11:58.674 --> 12:03.940
And I have been sober
a very long time now.

12:05.855 --> 12:09.598
I mean, I don't even know
how I'm supposed to act anymore.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.601
You know?
Or what I'm supposed to feel.

12:12.644 --> 12:16.213
I mean, what am I supposed
to do with all this?

12:18.999 --> 12:22.480
Am I supposed to hold out hope?

12:22.524 --> 12:26.484
I mean, a mother is supposed
to hold out hope, right?

12:28.182 --> 12:31.620
What kind of mother would I be
if I just gave up hope?

12:42.892 --> 12:45.112
But what if I just
don't have any?

12:49.681 --> 12:52.075
What if this is all
just bullshit?

13:12.879 --> 13:14.750
Guess it's about
that time of year.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.753
-Hey, Cora.
-Allison.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.189
-I was in the area, so...

13:19.233 --> 13:21.713
-Yeah? Well, I'm fine.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.194
You can cross this off
your guilty conscience list

13:24.238 --> 13:27.197
or whatever it is you do.

13:27.241 --> 13:30.026
-I'm around, you know?
-You're around?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.987
You want to go grab a beer?

13:38.252 --> 13:41.037
-How are you, um --
How are you doing?

13:43.561 --> 13:45.259
-Existing.

13:49.219 --> 13:50.742
Today, um...

13:50.786 --> 13:53.571
-Yeah. I know what today is.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.408
-I see how people look at me,
you know?

14:06.236 --> 14:08.456
-Probably just don't even know
what to say.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.545
-Yeah.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.548
Well, when they
do say something,

14:13.591 --> 14:16.943
I spend the whole conversation
comforting them.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.685
I mean, how does that work?

14:20.729 --> 14:22.296
And then they end it
with some bullshit

14:22.339 --> 14:23.732
they don't even mean.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.125
I swear to God,

14:25.168 --> 14:26.735
if I hear
"We're in this together"

14:26.778 --> 14:29.129
from one more fucking person...

14:35.222 --> 14:37.137
I miss Mom.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.054
-Yeah, I do, too.

14:43.230 --> 14:47.234
But that big house
feels pretty quiet.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.453
-Well, I actually
kind of like it.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.457
Just me and my ghost.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.941
Noah loved that house.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.421
You know, she kept
a room for him?

15:00.464 --> 15:03.511
-Yeah, I know.
-Yeah.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.079
I sleep in there sometimes.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.823
Sorry.
I forget how to talk to people.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.828
-Look, um...

15:16.872 --> 15:18.308
I'm not going to pretend

15:18.352 --> 15:20.310
that I know what it's like
to live your life.

15:20.354 --> 15:24.445
But, for what it's worth,

15:24.488 --> 15:27.839
it never leaves me.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.799
Not even for a second.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.889
-That came pretty close to
"We're in this together."

15:46.249 --> 15:49.209
-Hey.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.167
You got to go.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.346
Something wrong?

15:56.390 --> 15:59.175
-No, you just --
You just got to go.

17:29.352 --> 17:32.703
-Cora, I cannot do
anything to help you unless

17:32.747 --> 17:34.836
you tell me what happened.

17:36.881 --> 17:43.410
Cora, let me help you. Okay?
I really do want to help you.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.597
-There was a man.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.338
-What?

18:02.385 --> 18:05.475
-There was a man.

18:05.519 --> 18:08.348
-♪ How could you

18:08.391 --> 18:12.221
♪ Love me, love

18:19.054 --> 18:20.969
-What can I get you?

18:21.012 --> 18:22.405
-Hey.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.407
-Hey. What's up?

18:24.451 --> 18:27.671
-I was just in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd grab a bite.

18:27.715 --> 18:30.718
What's -- What's good?

18:30.761 --> 18:33.024
-Good?

18:33.068 --> 18:37.507
Um, the burgers are safe.

18:37.551 --> 18:40.293
Meat loaf, not so much.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.645
-Let's live dangerously.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.867
-Meat loaf.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.532
-Mm. Thank you.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.100
-Mm-hmm.

19:06.580 --> 19:09.148
-You can do that?
-What?

19:09.191 --> 19:10.758
Oh, well, I'm off in a few,

19:10.801 --> 19:13.500
and there ain't
nobody here anyway.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.198
What are you,
the waitress police?

19:17.460 --> 19:19.158
-You want anything
besides water?

19:19.201 --> 19:20.942
-No.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.947
What?

19:25.990 --> 19:28.993
Don't be weird.

19:29.037 --> 19:33.476
-It's...your button.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.652
My little girl's favorite movie.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.437
-Oh.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.441
-It's Noah's, too.

19:41.484 --> 19:45.923
-Huh. You know,
there's this theory.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.885
The entire story
was in the dad's mind.

19:50.928 --> 19:55.846
Male clown fish
are known to eat their eggs.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.631
-Hm.
-They'll protect the nest.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.894
Make sure everyone's safe.

19:59.937 --> 20:02.157
Then turn around
and just start...

20:03.724 --> 20:06.640
The theory is that the dad
ate all the kids,

20:06.683 --> 20:10.818
so he never really
even ever had Nemo.

20:10.861 --> 20:14.691
So he goes on this journey,
just...

20:14.735 --> 20:18.129
goes off searching for him
to ease his conscience.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.353
-That's dark.

20:29.184 --> 20:35.016
Hey, I --
I really need to thank you.

20:35.059 --> 20:38.672
-Thank me?
-For sharing.

20:38.715 --> 20:44.112
I know that's no small thing,
and it helps people.

20:44.155 --> 20:47.768
We're all alone until
we find out that we're not.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.857
-Well, that just
kind of came out.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.904
I mean, I'm glad if it might
have helped somebody,

20:53.948 --> 20:57.168
but my motivation
was not that noble.

21:05.568 --> 21:09.529
-It actually means
"nobody" in Latin.

21:13.359 --> 21:18.581
-So the movie is actually called
"Finding Nobody"?

21:24.370 --> 21:26.110
Are you okay?

21:31.942 --> 21:33.901
Meat loaf.

21:42.997 --> 21:46.522
-No!

21:46.566 --> 21:48.655
-You've ruined everything.

21:53.921 --> 21:56.532
-Her clothing get processed?
-Confirmed.

21:56.576 --> 21:57.881
-Blood swaps?

21:57.925 --> 21:59.492
-Everything's off
to the lab in the a.m.

21:59.535 --> 22:02.495
-What about, um, 911 calls,
missing persons reports,

22:02.538 --> 22:05.715
anything like that?
-No, nothing.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.239
-Who the fuck's blood
is on you, Cora?

22:08.283 --> 22:09.719
-An animal maybe?

22:09.763 --> 22:11.417
-What?
-You saw all that creepy shit.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.636
What if it came from
a, I don't know,

22:13.680 --> 22:15.290
goat or something?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.379
-Field kits showed
presumptive positive

22:17.423 --> 22:21.296
for human hemoglobin, Detective.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.906
Is she a hype, Sarge?

22:22.950 --> 22:24.386
-In her day.

22:24.430 --> 22:28.390
-Well, she's got
to be using then.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.174
-Maybe.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.598
-Hey. Hey.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.165
-Hey.

23:07.690 --> 23:10.258
-You stopped coming to group.

23:12.739 --> 23:15.785
-Yeah, I think -- I'm really
busy right now, so...

23:20.834 --> 23:23.140
-Can I come in for one minute?

23:24.490 --> 23:27.971
-I don't really
think that that's...

23:28.015 --> 23:29.756
-For a minute.

23:31.975 --> 23:34.804
We've all been
a little worried.

23:34.848 --> 23:35.892
-I'm fine.

23:35.936 --> 23:38.286
-How can we help?
-Okay.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.596
I don't think
I can do it anymore.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.816
Group. It's just --

23:46.860 --> 23:49.253
it's all getting to me
a little bit too much.

23:51.952 --> 23:55.608
-Is there any way I can
convince you to come back?

23:55.651 --> 23:56.957
-I really appreciate

23:57.000 --> 24:00.395
everything
that you've done for me.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.833
I really, really do.

24:03.877 --> 24:07.489
I mean, it is far more than
anybody else has bothered,

24:07.533 --> 24:11.014
but, uh, I just -- I can't do
this anymore.

24:11.058 --> 24:13.016
Any of it.

24:16.933 --> 24:19.893
-Cora, how badly do you
want to heal?

24:22.983 --> 24:25.464
-How what?

24:26.421 --> 24:28.989
What kind of question is that?

24:29.032 --> 24:30.947
-What if I told you...

24:36.605 --> 24:40.304
What if I told you there was
a way to truly heal all of this?

24:42.176 --> 24:43.525
-Thank you.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.485
But I am all tapped out
on the self-help.

24:46.528 --> 24:49.879
-No, no. I mean really.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.448
Heal it.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.974
Fix it.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.940
What if you could see him again?

25:09.464 --> 25:11.335
-Is that supposed to be funny?

25:14.034 --> 25:15.862
I mean, what the fuck
does that even mean?

25:15.905 --> 25:17.864
-Exactly what I just said.

25:17.907 --> 25:20.344
-Mm.

25:20.388 --> 25:23.609
Like some
metaphysical bullshit?

25:23.652 --> 25:26.525
Like a like a seance
or something?

25:28.657 --> 25:31.573
-Something like that.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.360
Okay, um...

25:36.404 --> 25:39.450
I really do appreciate
your concern, but, uh,

25:39.494 --> 25:43.150
I got things that
I got to do, so...

25:43.193 --> 25:44.891
-You do?

25:47.937 --> 25:51.811
What do you have to do to?

25:51.854 --> 25:55.771
-I don't know. Things.

25:55.815 --> 25:59.949
Real tangible things
that I can touch with my hands

25:59.993 --> 26:01.472
and I can see with my eyes.

26:01.516 --> 26:05.868
-Cora, I am offering you
a chance to undo this.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.480
-Cora, you know what happened
to me, right?

26:09.524 --> 26:10.873
You know I lost my little girl.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.483
-Mm-hmm.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.795
-Well, I got her back.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.580
-What?

26:23.407 --> 26:25.192
-She's alive.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.497
-Please. Go.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.369
-She's alive.

26:28.412 --> 26:31.198
I got her back.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.808
She's alive and well,
I'm telling you.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.245
-Bye-bye.
-She's alive.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.515
Yeah.

27:00.575 --> 27:03.186
-Cora?

27:03.230 --> 27:06.625
What did he mean by that?
That he got his daughter back?

27:10.629 --> 27:13.066
God damn it, Cora.
You got to help me out here.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.328
Why did he say that?

27:14.371 --> 27:16.025
-Because it was true.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.462
-What was true? That he found
his daughter somewhere?

27:18.506 --> 27:22.728
-No. No. He brought her back.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.860
-Back? From where?

27:24.904 --> 27:27.733
-Fuck. I don't know.
Where do you go when you die?

27:27.776 --> 27:30.779
- Jesus Christ.

27:30.823 --> 27:34.565
-I'm telling you, you don't
know every fucking thing.

27:34.609 --> 27:37.351
-Yeah, well, let me tell you
what I do know.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.179
I know that
that little girl is dead

27:39.222 --> 27:42.312
because I saw them pull her
lifeless body out of the water.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.097
Mill County got the guy, Cora.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.968
It was some carny
out of Sioux Falls.

27:46.012 --> 27:48.231
I mean, full confession,
physical evidence.

27:48.275 --> 27:51.321
And did I mention a body?

27:51.365 --> 27:54.368
-She is alive.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.718
They changed her last name
to the ex-wife's,

27:56.762 --> 27:59.982
and they moved to some
richy bitch part of Boston.

28:00.026 --> 28:03.725
Alive and well.
I'm fucking telling you.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.948
Becky or Beverly or some shit.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.995
Go look it up
on your back computer.

28:25.225 --> 28:27.227
Jesus.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.278
-Tell me.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.762
-I'd feel better if --

28:40.806 --> 28:43.983
-No. Right here.

28:56.909 --> 29:00.129
-When they...

29:00.173 --> 29:04.568
found -- when they pulled her
from the water,

29:04.612 --> 29:07.180
she was...

29:07.223 --> 29:09.922
you know...

29:09.965 --> 29:12.620
the...

29:12.663 --> 29:16.929
Fish had gotten to her.
She'd been down there a while.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.108
She was still so beautiful.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.677
So beautiful.

29:26.721 --> 29:30.681
It was not long after that
when, uh...

29:30.725 --> 29:35.686
a woman came to find me.

29:37.863 --> 29:41.257
She was -- I still don't know.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.305
But she started to tell me
these things.

29:45.348 --> 29:47.786
She told me
what I'm telling you.

29:50.049 --> 29:53.443
There is a way to get them back.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.667
-Back from where?

29:59.710 --> 30:01.669
-Wherever it is they go.

30:03.062 --> 30:06.413
-I'm going to get in your truck.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.415
But only because I'm cold.

30:10.199 --> 30:12.419
But if it gets weird...

30:12.462 --> 30:15.335
Just don't be weird.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.689
-It's a ritual.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.865
-Like a seance?
-No.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.649
It's like a ritual.

30:28.391 --> 30:33.005
It's old, like Mesopotamian
or something.

30:33.048 --> 30:37.052
I swear on my life
that I did this.

30:37.096 --> 30:40.099
I did this, and it worked.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.057
Look, you know what
happened to her.

30:42.101 --> 30:45.234
Everybody around here knows.
They just know.

30:45.278 --> 30:49.238
The same way they
know your story.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.588
But you know she's alive,
don't you?

30:57.203 --> 30:59.161
You wouldn't be here.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.665
-Hello?

31:24.708 --> 31:27.537
Uh, yeah. No, I'm sorry.
She's passed.

31:27.581 --> 31:30.018
Yeah. This is your daughter.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.672
No, the other one.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.326
Mm-hmm.

31:33.369 --> 31:36.633
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right.

32:02.181 --> 32:04.313
What the fuck am I doing?

33:47.503 --> 33:51.942
♪ Where, oh, where
could the little boy be? ♪

33:51.986 --> 33:57.296
♪ The monster mom
needs tickles to live ♪

34:02.518 --> 34:03.954
-Boo!
-Oh!

34:03.998 --> 34:06.435
I found you, Mr. Magoo.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.701
Oh, that tickles!

35:03.013 --> 35:05.146
-Yeah. She left me.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.713
-I know.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.106
-Yeah. A long time ago.

35:08.149 --> 35:11.892
Right when Nolan went missing.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.937
-Noah.

35:13.981 --> 35:19.073
-Oh, yeah. Well -- yeah, right.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.162
-You're served.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.251
-The fuck?

35:23.295 --> 35:25.340
-You stay away from her house.

35:25.384 --> 35:26.863
-I'll go where the fuck I want.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.256
-Yeah, well, that
paper says otherwise.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.477
100 yards.
You have a nice day.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.785
-Hey!

35:35.829 --> 35:39.572
Hey, how's it feel to know that
you're just shitty at your job?

35:39.615 --> 35:44.011
I mean, you did --
you did find his, um,

35:44.054 --> 35:45.621
his shoe, though, right?

35:45.665 --> 35:47.145
So you got that going for you.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.798
You didn't completely
go home empty handed,

35:48.842 --> 35:50.322
but then you just
sort of gave up.

35:50.365 --> 35:51.714
I mean, who does that?

35:51.758 --> 35:54.804
Who -- who gives up
on a missing kid?

35:54.848 --> 35:58.112
And may-- Maybe it was
just too tough.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.505
You know, tough case.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.770
Too tough for a lady cop.
I'm a feminist.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.641
You know, I'm all for --
I'm on your side.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.427
I want to get you up there
on top and on the bottom

36:08.470 --> 36:10.211
and down on your knees,
rolling around.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.213
What's up, lady cop?
You forget something?

36:12.257 --> 36:13.649
-Well, you got a syringe

36:13.693 --> 36:15.303
sticking out of
your pocket, Wyatt.

36:15.347 --> 36:16.565
-Fuck my life.

36:16.609 --> 36:17.914
-What about any weapons?

36:17.958 --> 36:19.568
You got any weapons
in the trailer

36:19.612 --> 36:21.091
that I need to worry about?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:21.135 --> 36:22.528
Don't even think about it.

36:22.571 --> 36:24.356
-Hey. Hey.

36:25.792 --> 36:29.622
-You stay away from Cora.
You understand me?

36:32.146 --> 36:34.931
-If she's looking for an excuse.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.717
-Just say it.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.241
-Yeah, big sister to the rescue?

36:40.285 --> 36:43.113
-Say it.

36:43.157 --> 36:46.160
-Yeah. I got to stay away.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.555
-You want to pick that up?
Go ahead.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.644
I gave you permission.

36:55.343 --> 36:56.953
That paper says 100 yards.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.521
But I want you to pretend
it says 100 miles.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.480
Can you say that for me?

37:03.438 --> 37:06.354
-Hundred miles.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.748
-Good boy.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.276
His name is Noah,
piece of shit.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.896
-Any electronics in the house?

37:26.940 --> 37:29.464
-Uh, no.

37:29.508 --> 37:32.815
No, like Internet or anything.

37:32.859 --> 37:35.035
I mean, there's one,
like, tiny spot

37:35.078 --> 37:39.300
on the upstairs near the floor
that you can get cell reception.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.084
-Okay, good.

37:41.128 --> 37:44.305
No, we don't want any -- any
interference, no distraction.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.741
This is...

37:45.785 --> 37:47.917
-...real pine soap?

37:47.961 --> 37:49.702
-Mm-hmm.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.319
-And the salt?

37:58.363 --> 38:00.452
-Yeah, that's kosher.
Like you told me to.

38:00.495 --> 38:05.370
-Good. No, that's good.
Table salt has iodine in it.

38:05.413 --> 38:08.982
It has to be kosher or sea salt.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.027
It's a very specific.

38:11.071 --> 38:14.074
-The afterlife is finicky
about its condiments.

38:16.729 --> 38:19.862
-Look, I understand
if you're not completely sold

38:19.906 --> 38:24.606
on all of this,
but I need to know right now

38:24.650 --> 38:26.173
how committed that you are.

38:26.216 --> 38:30.873
This -- this is very real,
and any deviation --

38:30.917 --> 38:32.353
-I didn't mean to offend you
or anything.

38:32.397 --> 38:33.702
I really didn't.
-I under--

38:33.746 --> 38:35.008
-I just. I'm sorry.
This is like --

38:35.051 --> 38:39.404
It's all like, you know,
I mean, come on.

38:39.447 --> 38:42.798
There's, like, a damn shackle
bolted to the floor,

38:42.842 --> 38:44.626
for Christ's sake.
-Alright, we should just --

38:44.670 --> 38:45.888
We should just call this off.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.107
-What?
-No, this cannot

38:47.150 --> 38:49.936
be done half way!
-No, no!

38:53.287 --> 38:56.203
-I'm sorry.

38:56.246 --> 38:57.813
Sorry.

38:59.772 --> 39:03.210
-I...I'm...sorry.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.168
I'm sorry, I...

39:05.212 --> 39:08.084
Listen, I agreed to this,
and -- and you're right.

39:08.128 --> 39:11.349
I'll do whatever it is
that you tell me I need to do.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.351
And I'm sorry.

39:15.875 --> 39:18.399
Truly.

39:18.443 --> 39:22.621
-This is going
to be very painful.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.100
I cannot stress that enough.

39:24.144 --> 39:27.147
It is something
that you have never known.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.021
-Okay.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.722
-We're gonna need
to get you clean.

39:36.765 --> 39:39.028
-Salt bath thing.
-Yeah.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.775
Hey, Cora.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.257
-Yeah?

39:50.300 --> 39:52.912
-I'm not coming in. Are you --
Are you in the bath?

39:52.955 --> 39:55.436
-I am.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.917
-I forgot to tell you
about the salt.

39:57.960 --> 40:03.792
So the salt creates
a protective layer.

40:03.836 --> 40:07.666
But also -- it also absorbs
negative energy.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.059
-That's great. Thank you.

40:10.103 --> 40:13.106
-Okay, so once you once
you soak in it,

40:13.149 --> 40:15.021
you're going to scrub with it
like I showed you,

40:15.064 --> 40:17.632
and then rinse with clean water.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.809
All those impurities
will go down the drain.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.597
-Awesome.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.294
-Okay. You got it?

40:27.337 --> 40:30.036
-I got it. Thank you.

40:31.080 --> 40:34.214
-I'll be downstairs.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.826
-Make yourself at home.

40:44.790 --> 40:47.445
Can I ask you something?

40:47.488 --> 40:49.185
-Of course.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.757
-Why is there so much sadness
in your eyes?

41:00.327 --> 41:03.417
-Is there?
-Yeah.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.941
Yeah, there is,
and I can see it, but I just,

41:05.985 --> 41:08.466
I can't figure it out.

41:08.509 --> 41:11.512
I mean, you got her back, right?

41:11.556 --> 41:16.125
You thought you lost her,
but you got her back.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.866
No strings.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.871
-You know I haven't
seen her, right?

41:25.831 --> 41:28.877
-What?

41:28.921 --> 41:30.923
Are you serious?

41:41.934 --> 41:44.893
I just have some...

41:44.937 --> 41:48.941
thing to take care of
before I go.

41:53.032 --> 41:55.904
She's safe with her mother.

41:55.948 --> 41:58.559
I'll go out there
and visit her as soon as I

41:58.603 --> 42:00.779
get everything squared away.

42:16.882 --> 42:19.580
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

42:19.624 --> 42:20.973
-It's for your protection.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.757
-My protection?
What does that mean?

42:22.801 --> 42:24.716
Wait, you never told me that
this fucking thing was for me.

42:24.759 --> 42:26.413
-You're only going
to need this for today.

42:26.456 --> 42:29.764
After this, it won't be
necessary, I promise.

42:32.419 --> 42:35.814
You have to remember
everything you're going through,

42:35.857 --> 42:37.772
I have done.

42:37.816 --> 42:41.254
This is...

42:41.297 --> 42:42.603
This is just how it works.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.997
You either trust
me or you don't.

42:53.527 --> 42:54.920
-Too tight?

42:54.963 --> 43:00.055
-Um, I don't know. It's...

43:01.143 --> 43:04.103
No, it's great.

43:04.146 --> 43:08.237
-Look, this part is the most
physically demanding of you.

43:08.281 --> 43:10.326
Especially because you're
so malnourished

43:10.370 --> 43:12.111
and probably, you know...

43:12.154 --> 43:14.287
But it was very important,

43:14.330 --> 43:16.942
critical to get all those
impurities out of your system.

43:16.985 --> 43:18.813
You did exactly
what you needed to do, okay?

43:18.857 --> 43:20.423
-Great. Can we just,
like, get the show

43:20.467 --> 43:21.947
on the road here and tell me
what I have to do?

43:21.990 --> 43:25.428
-Nothing.
Don't do anything.

43:25.472 --> 43:27.169
You just stand there.

43:27.213 --> 43:29.955
Just be open.

43:29.998 --> 43:33.654
Repeat the rite exactly
as I say it.

43:33.698 --> 43:36.396
And -- and no sitting.

43:36.439 --> 43:37.832
Stand only. It's very important.

43:37.876 --> 43:39.138
-I got it. I got it. Let's go.

43:39.181 --> 43:40.356
-That's important.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.097
-I get it.

43:48.669 --> 43:51.019
-We come of our own accord.

43:53.239 --> 43:55.328
-We come of our own accord.

43:55.371 --> 43:58.418
-We seek only that which
is made available to us.

44:00.246 --> 44:04.424
-We seek only that which
is made available to us.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.470
-We reject the natural order

44:07.514 --> 44:10.909
and remove ourselves
from the spiritual covering...

44:11.997 --> 44:14.260
...of life

44:14.303 --> 44:18.351
-We reject the natural order
and remove ourselves

44:18.394 --> 44:21.310
from the spiritual
covering of life.

44:59.305 --> 45:01.481
-Can we stop?

45:06.442 --> 45:08.401
-I need to stop.

45:12.927 --> 45:15.408
Abel, I want to stop.

45:15.451 --> 45:17.497
I need some water.

45:22.807 --> 45:25.505
-Hey!

45:25.548 --> 45:27.333
Come on. What the fuck?
This is bullshit.

45:27.376 --> 45:28.900
Nothing's happening.

45:30.553 --> 45:35.254
-Abel, I'm going to take
this off right fucking now.

45:35.297 --> 45:37.735
-God damn it, I'm not playing!

45:37.778 --> 45:40.172
I'm going to take this off!
What the fuck?!

45:45.307 --> 45:48.093
-I swear to God, Abel,
if you don't --

45:59.104 --> 46:00.975
-Yes.

46:01.019 --> 46:03.195
Oh! Oh!

46:03.238 --> 46:05.501
- Oh, God!
Oh, holy fuck!

46:05.545 --> 46:07.199
-Are you okay?
-Oh, Jesus!

46:07.242 --> 46:09.810
-Yes.
-What was that?!

46:09.854 --> 46:13.031
What was that?
I was floating.

46:13.074 --> 46:15.424
I was floating in the air!

46:15.468 --> 46:17.078
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.

46:17.122 --> 46:19.646
I felt it. I felt it.

46:19.689 --> 46:22.736
It was like an energy
in my chest.

46:22.780 --> 46:26.218
Oh, my God. This is real.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.657
I'm going to hold my baby again.

46:30.700 --> 46:34.095
I'm going to hold
my baby boy again!

47:06.388 --> 47:10.697
We seek to bring the dead
back to the living.

47:16.572 --> 47:21.316
-We seek to bring the dead
back to the living.

48:12.367 --> 48:14.369
-Has he come for you?

48:18.112 --> 48:22.769
-We say come. We say come.

48:29.167 --> 48:31.430
-It's fine. All right.
You're here with me.

48:31.473 --> 48:32.822
You're safe.
-No, I'm not safe.

48:32.866 --> 48:34.346
-Yes, you are.
-We are not safe.

48:34.389 --> 48:36.478
-Okay, look at me.
-Not safe, not safe.

48:36.522 --> 48:40.395
-Honey, just look at me.
There we go. It's okay.

48:40.439 --> 48:43.137
-It was like a daylight
just shut off.

48:43.181 --> 48:45.792
Like somebody flipped a switch.

48:47.141 --> 48:48.664
-Okay.
-No.

48:50.666 --> 48:51.841
Okay.

48:51.885 --> 48:54.409
-No, we have to go back.

48:54.453 --> 48:56.977
We have to go back.

48:57.021 --> 49:00.763
It was like we invited...

49:00.807 --> 49:05.986
There is an order, and we have
to follow the order.

49:06.030 --> 49:07.379
But...

49:07.422 --> 49:09.033
-But what?

49:19.173 --> 49:20.783
-No. Get the fuck out of here.

49:20.827 --> 49:22.394
-That's the first thing
you're going to say to me?

49:22.437 --> 49:24.178
-Hey, Wyatt, the restraining
order is still good.

49:24.222 --> 49:25.571
I renew it every fucking year.

49:25.614 --> 49:29.270
- God, Cora, come on.

49:29.314 --> 49:31.185
-Answer's still the same.
I got nothing for you, okay?

49:31.229 --> 49:33.535
I got no money, no nothing.
So get the fuck off my porch.

49:33.579 --> 49:36.190
-You don't even know
what I was here for.

49:36.234 --> 49:38.018
-All right, you know,
I'm going to call the cops.

49:38.062 --> 49:41.456
-Fuck. We both know your phone
don't work for shit out here.

49:45.504 --> 49:48.681
Holy shit, Cora.

49:48.724 --> 49:50.378
I thought he was
a church going girl.

49:50.422 --> 49:53.077
Clutched my pearls.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.426
Unless that's your daddy.

49:54.469 --> 49:55.775
-Okay, Abel, it's fine.
I got this.

49:55.818 --> 50:00.345
-Huh? Oh, your daddy
killed himself.

50:00.388 --> 50:03.304
Hey, man.

50:03.348 --> 50:05.567
Hey, don't I know you?

50:05.611 --> 50:08.048
-No, man,
I don't think you do.

50:08.092 --> 50:10.311
-No, yeah. Oh, shit. My bad.

50:10.355 --> 50:12.705
You -- your face
was all over my TV for

50:12.748 --> 50:14.054
I don't know how long, right?

50:14.098 --> 50:15.708
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Fuck it.

50:15.751 --> 50:18.754
Local celebrity pulling
that girl out of the gorge.

50:18.798 --> 50:21.061
-Hey, shut up! Shut the fuck up.
You can't be here.

50:21.105 --> 50:25.413
-I can be anywhere the fuck
I want to be, little lady.

50:25.457 --> 50:27.763
You fucking her, Abel, huh?

50:27.807 --> 50:31.550
Yeah? Are you able, Abel?

50:31.593 --> 50:33.378
-Okay. Well, she asked you
to leave, so...

50:33.421 --> 50:36.598
-You know what? It's okay.
Really. He's nothing.

50:36.642 --> 50:39.210
He's just a strung out
piece of shit.

50:39.253 --> 50:41.516
-Pot and kettle, Cora.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.606
-Pot and fucking kettle.

50:44.650 --> 50:50.003
Your, um, your new man friend,
he, uh,

50:50.047 --> 50:52.484
he really know you, like,
really know you?

50:52.527 --> 50:54.486
Like all those dicks
you sucked for dope.

50:54.529 --> 50:56.488
-Ah!
-Hey. Hey, man.

50:56.531 --> 50:58.229
-Hey, man!

51:06.367 --> 51:07.847
-What?

51:07.890 --> 51:09.327
What the fuck are you
going to do with that?

51:09.370 --> 51:11.068
-I'm going to take it
upside your fucking head

51:11.111 --> 51:13.026
if I have to
-Hey, no. Hey. Fuck.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.115
I'm going.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.335
You know, you two
deserve each other.

51:17.378 --> 51:19.815
We're fucking
Parents in the World Club.

51:19.859 --> 51:22.122
-Leave!
-I'm going!

51:22.166 --> 51:24.951
Man, you guys probably just,
like, holding each other

51:24.994 --> 51:26.822
after doing it,
and you're just like,

51:26.866 --> 51:29.608
"Oh, I'm the worst parent,
no, I'm the worst parent.

51:29.651 --> 51:31.436
No, baby, you did your best."

51:31.479 --> 51:34.221
And you're like, "Well, your
best ain't fucking good enough.

51:34.265 --> 51:35.831
Well, I lost my kid.

51:35.875 --> 51:38.486
My kid fell down
a fucking hole in the earth.

51:38.530 --> 51:40.532
How the fuck are you
going to deal with that?

51:40.575 --> 51:43.491
Well, I just gave up
on my fucking kid.

51:43.535 --> 51:45.102
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

51:45.145 --> 51:47.800
Well, you know, it's even worse.
I don't even..."

51:50.542 --> 51:52.674
-I'm really sorry, Abel.

51:55.982 --> 51:58.419
That is not your fault.

52:01.596 --> 52:05.687
That's really nice and all,
but, uh...

52:05.731 --> 52:09.865
I shouldn't let other people pay
for my shitty life choices.

52:09.909 --> 52:13.782
-Are you sure you're ready
to do this today?

52:13.826 --> 52:15.915
-What?

52:19.788 --> 52:23.401
Wyatt fucked up everything
good in my life.

52:23.444 --> 52:26.012
And he is not taking this
from me, too.

52:26.055 --> 52:31.191
-I can't come up with the words
to explain to you

52:31.235 --> 52:33.889
how difficult today will be.

52:35.369 --> 52:37.154
-We go on.

53:00.089 --> 53:03.049
-We come of our own accord,
and we do what we will,

53:03.092 --> 53:05.138
not what we are told.

53:05.182 --> 53:08.620
-We come of our own accord,
and we do what we will,

53:08.663 --> 53:11.536
not what we are told.

53:11.579 --> 53:13.494
-Today...

53:15.975 --> 53:19.326
...we ask for grief.

53:19.370 --> 53:22.721
-Today we ask for grief.

53:22.764 --> 53:27.204
-Grief of the highest order.

53:27.987 --> 53:30.990
-Grief of the highest order.

53:31.033 --> 53:34.211
-Remittance for that
we wish to receive.

53:34.254 --> 53:38.519
-Remittance for that
which we wish to receive.

58:52.964 --> 58:54.879
Shh!

58:56.358 --> 59:00.014
The rules, child.

59:01.059 --> 59:04.889
Lest this be

59:04.932 --> 59:09.241
your last memory of him.

59:36.442 --> 59:38.662
I wasn't drugged.

59:38.705 --> 59:42.579
I saw those places.
I was there.

59:48.846 --> 59:50.456
-Look, I...

59:50.499 --> 59:54.503
I'm trying really hard
to just sit here and listen,

59:54.547 --> 59:55.940
but it's really hard
with all the shit

59:55.983 --> 59:59.073
that we've been
through with your...

59:59.117 --> 1:00:02.294
-With my what?
Hey, with my what?

1:00:02.337 --> 1:00:03.861
-With your choices, Cora.

1:00:03.904 --> 1:00:06.646
With your piss poor
fucking choices.

1:00:08.039 --> 1:00:10.041
You run away
from everything, you know?

1:00:10.084 --> 1:00:11.999
You sabotage whatever
you can't run away from.

1:00:12.043 --> 1:00:13.522
You put every fucking chemical
you can find

1:00:13.566 --> 1:00:15.742
in your body, right?

1:00:15.786 --> 1:00:17.657
You know, I never even know
what's up or down with you.

1:00:17.701 --> 1:00:19.572
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1:00:19.616 --> 1:00:21.313
-Well, I'm sorry that
I could never live up

1:00:21.356 --> 1:00:22.880
to the golden child
bar that you set.

1:00:22.923 --> 1:00:26.057
-Oh, fuck.
-No way.

1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:27.667
What do you want me
to fucking say?

1:00:27.711 --> 1:00:31.062
And how many times do you
want me to fucking say it?

1:00:31.105 --> 1:00:32.672
-Why didn't you call me?

1:00:32.716 --> 1:00:35.414
-Oh, so you could tell me
that I was fucking crazy,

1:00:35.457 --> 1:00:37.068
that I was fucking using,

1:00:37.111 --> 1:00:39.679
or whatever the fuck
you wanted to say?

1:00:39.723 --> 1:00:44.249
That shit was real. It was real.

1:00:44.292 --> 1:00:47.861
And it was the only way.

1:00:47.905 --> 1:00:50.298
You weren't going to
bring him home.

1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:00.178
-Christ.

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:56.930
-You got a minute?

1:01:56.974 --> 1:01:58.889
-Yeah. What's up?

1:02:01.805 --> 1:02:03.545
-What am I looking at?

1:02:03.589 --> 1:02:06.244
-Autopsy of the Turner girl
pulled from the gorge last year.

1:02:06.287 --> 1:02:07.724
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, I recognize her.

1:02:07.767 --> 1:02:09.290
What's with the school
print out?

1:02:09.334 --> 1:02:11.771
-From Blanchard Middle School.

1:02:11.815 --> 1:02:13.860
In Boston.

1:02:13.904 --> 1:02:16.428
Taken last month.

1:02:31.791 --> 1:02:34.968
-You ready?

1:02:35.012 --> 1:02:36.840
-No.

1:02:40.452 --> 1:02:42.454
-How are these things
still here?

1:02:42.497 --> 1:02:45.370
-My mom had some kind
of sealer put on them,

1:02:45.413 --> 1:02:48.765
and I think they're starting
to show their age.

1:02:53.421 --> 1:02:55.641
-It's going to
show itself today.

1:02:58.992 --> 1:03:02.300
Remember, this is a barter.

1:03:02.343 --> 1:03:04.171
Not a gift.

1:03:08.175 --> 1:03:10.090
Stay in that circle.

1:03:10.134 --> 1:03:12.876
If you forget everything else,
remember that.

1:03:12.919 --> 1:03:15.356
Stay in.

1:03:17.141 --> 1:03:19.926
We're gonna be fine.

1:03:20.927 --> 1:03:23.277
We're almost there.

1:03:50.435 --> 1:03:53.830
We come of our own accord.

1:03:53.873 --> 1:03:56.789
-We come of our own accord.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:59.444
-Invitation has been extended.

1:03:59.487 --> 1:04:02.099
-Invitation has been extended.

1:04:03.317 --> 1:04:05.754
-Grief endured.

1:04:05.798 --> 1:04:08.105
-Grief endured.

1:04:17.418 --> 1:04:20.378
-We now author the symbols
of your arrival.

1:04:24.730 --> 1:04:27.864
-We now author the symbols
of your arrival.

1:05:26.052 --> 1:05:28.315
Come.

1:05:28.359 --> 1:05:30.056
Come to us now.

1:05:31.797 --> 1:05:33.538
-Come.

1:05:33.581 --> 1:05:36.584
Come to us now.

1:05:43.548 --> 1:05:46.812
-From black, from black.

1:10:26.439 --> 1:10:29.268
Abel?

1:10:58.210 --> 1:10:59.777
You...

1:10:59.820 --> 1:11:01.779
This...

1:12:24.688 --> 1:12:28.474
-Do you not wish to set eyes
on him again?

1:12:28.518 --> 1:12:33.914
To once more savor
his innocent scent?

1:12:33.958 --> 1:12:38.528
Your boy...Noah.

1:12:41.052 --> 1:12:42.880
-Yes.

1:12:42.923 --> 1:12:45.056
Yes, please.

1:12:48.407 --> 1:12:50.583
I'm so sorry.

1:12:51.323 --> 1:12:53.456
I'll do anything.

1:12:54.631 --> 1:12:59.549
-I know you will, child.
I know you will.

1:13:01.551 --> 1:13:03.596
Finish what you begun.

1:13:06.512 --> 1:13:08.384
-How?

1:13:09.950 --> 1:13:11.648
I'm all alone.

1:13:13.737 --> 1:13:16.696
-You have all you need.

1:14:01.219 --> 1:14:04.135
-Told you. Fucking goat.

1:14:11.969 --> 1:14:13.318
-Come on, Jones.

1:14:13.361 --> 1:14:15.276
It's okay.

1:14:16.452 --> 1:14:19.150
It's okay. Come on.

1:15:12.116 --> 1:15:13.770
-Come.

1:15:23.649 --> 1:15:25.608
-I've done everything.

1:15:26.347 --> 1:15:28.088
-Come.

1:15:31.004 --> 1:15:33.746
-When do I see him?

1:15:33.790 --> 1:15:35.531
-Come, child.

1:15:37.663 --> 1:15:39.404
To the circle.

1:15:41.711 --> 1:15:43.539
For the boy.

1:16:16.484 --> 1:16:18.182
-This is it, Cora.

1:16:19.444 --> 1:16:22.142
Day of payment.

1:16:22.186 --> 1:16:25.798
-Noah? Where's Noah?

1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:30.368
-Soon.

1:17:12.497 --> 1:17:14.499
-I'm so sorry, Abel.

1:17:18.416 --> 1:17:21.027
-Plate.

1:17:21.071 --> 1:17:22.507
-What is this?

1:17:22.550 --> 1:17:24.509
-It's just goat.

1:17:25.249 --> 1:17:27.947
-No. I want to see Noah.

1:17:29.514 --> 1:17:33.039
-Plate!

1:17:38.654 --> 1:17:40.264
Fuck!

1:17:50.448 --> 1:17:53.625
Now, first is for flesh.

1:17:54.321 --> 1:17:58.282
The second, blood.

1:17:58.325 --> 1:18:02.112
The third, bone.

1:18:07.683 --> 1:18:08.945
Eat.

1:18:08.988 --> 1:18:11.774
-What?
-Eat.

1:18:11.817 --> 1:18:16.735
So that Noah's flesh, blood,
and bone can be made whole.

1:18:28.791 --> 1:18:30.575
Ah...

1:18:48.245 --> 1:18:50.769
-I gave my payment
for the gift of life.

1:18:50.813 --> 1:18:54.381
I carried the secret
in exchange for my daughter.

1:18:56.209 --> 1:18:58.603
He brought back to the living.

1:19:03.956 --> 1:19:07.220
And though I did not
see her again,

1:19:07.264 --> 1:19:10.963
I consider my payment
just and fair.

1:19:24.629 --> 1:19:26.326
-I don't --
-This is the last step, Cora.

1:19:26.370 --> 1:19:29.982
Drink so the rite is complete.

1:19:30.026 --> 1:19:31.592
-When do I see him?

1:19:31.636 --> 1:19:34.204
-I don't know.

1:19:34.247 --> 1:19:40.384
I know that if you drink, Noah
will be alive in the flesh.

1:19:40.427 --> 1:19:42.386
That's the accord.

1:19:47.434 --> 1:19:49.132
Drink it.

1:20:10.588 --> 1:20:12.198
-No!

1:20:13.591 --> 1:20:15.245
-Oh, no.

1:20:20.511 --> 1:20:25.995
-The woman who bestowed this
gift upon me paid her price!

1:20:26.038 --> 1:20:27.823
And I paid mine!

1:20:30.086 --> 1:20:34.525
As have countless souls
through millennia.

1:20:34.568 --> 1:20:39.791
You made clear this was worth
the toll, so pay yours.

1:20:41.967 --> 1:20:45.144
You must carry the --

1:20:45.188 --> 1:20:47.625
Shh.

1:20:47.668 --> 1:20:50.758
You must carry the seeker to
the next soul who needs it.

1:20:50.802 --> 1:20:53.587
It is the way.

1:20:53.631 --> 1:20:56.286
It's the only way!

1:20:56.329 --> 1:20:58.636
-Jesus Christ.

1:21:00.812 --> 1:21:02.770
Did you groom me?

1:21:02.814 --> 1:21:06.122
-Fuck you.
-In the group. In the group.

1:21:06.165 --> 1:21:08.080
Were you just looking
for somebody to pass this

1:21:08.124 --> 1:21:10.387
thing on to?

1:21:10.430 --> 1:21:12.389
Were you?!

1:21:24.270 --> 1:21:26.359
-You've ruined everything.

1:21:30.146 --> 1:21:32.104
I offered you rebirth.

1:21:34.454 --> 1:21:36.804
This is a divine gift.

1:21:36.848 --> 1:21:40.765
In return, you took
everything from me.

1:21:42.898 --> 1:21:47.293
You robbed me of ever seeing
my little baby girl again

1:21:47.337 --> 1:21:52.908
because you can't follow
simple fucking instructions.

1:21:55.345 --> 1:21:58.696
You fucking deserve this now!

1:22:01.220 --> 1:22:03.222
Drink!

1:22:05.268 --> 1:22:07.487
Drink it!

1:22:11.404 --> 1:22:14.233
-Fuck you.

1:22:18.150 --> 1:22:21.240
-No-o-o-o-o-o!

1:22:31.903 --> 1:22:35.646
I am owed.

1:22:36.212 --> 1:22:39.432
I will take back the prize.

1:22:40.564 --> 1:22:42.958
-No.
-The boy one was suffering

1:22:43.001 --> 1:22:44.655
without end.

1:22:44.698 --> 1:22:48.137
He will know nothing but pain
and sorrow and despair

1:22:48.180 --> 1:22:51.183
till the end of all things.

1:22:51.792 --> 1:22:54.926
- No. Please.

1:22:57.798 --> 1:23:00.105
You can't.

1:23:01.106 --> 1:23:03.108
-But I can.

1:23:06.416 --> 1:23:08.853
-There must be something.

1:23:08.896 --> 1:23:11.203
-I must have a vessel.

1:23:11.247 --> 1:23:13.249
The payment is clear.

1:23:13.292 --> 1:23:16.426
That is the way.

1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:19.211
-I can get you a vessel.

1:23:19.864 --> 1:23:22.040
I can.

1:23:22.084 --> 1:23:26.305
-No games, girl.

1:23:29.091 --> 1:23:32.007
-No games. I can.

1:23:33.878 --> 1:23:35.706
I can.

1:23:44.106 --> 1:23:47.065
Hey.

1:23:47.109 --> 1:23:49.198
Yeah, I know.

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:54.855
I really need
to see you tonight.

1:23:54.899 --> 1:23:58.250
No, no, no. Tonight.

1:23:58.294 --> 1:24:00.209
Can you score?

1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:05.083
Yeah. Yeah.

1:24:05.127 --> 1:24:06.737
Hey.

1:24:08.565 --> 1:24:10.306
Hurry.

1:24:38.508 --> 1:24:40.423
-Sweet pea?

1:24:44.862 --> 1:24:46.559
Sweetie pie?

1:25:02.706 --> 1:25:04.577
The fuck?

1:25:18.243 --> 1:25:21.638
Ooh, peek-a-boo.

1:25:21.681 --> 1:25:23.683
I see you.

1:25:25.337 --> 1:25:27.818
Hey.

1:25:27.861 --> 1:25:29.515
I got your shit.

1:25:31.256 --> 1:25:33.606
And you still got
your clothes on.

1:25:36.479 --> 1:25:38.611
Dope ain't free, Cora.

1:26:05.203 --> 1:26:07.727
-What is this, girl?

1:26:11.383 --> 1:26:14.473
-I gave you...

1:26:14.517 --> 1:26:17.520
-This vessel is tainted.

1:26:21.959 --> 1:26:24.744
Unclean.

1:28:16.334 --> 1:28:18.945
-911. What's your emergency?

1:28:33.438 --> 1:28:35.701
-Um...

1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:39.226
Let's, uh --
Let's get her cleaned up.

1:28:47.060 --> 1:28:49.193
We're going to get you a shower.

1:28:49.236 --> 1:28:50.934
-And then what?
-And then I'm going

1:28:50.977 --> 1:28:52.457
to bring you over to Holding
until we can get

1:28:52.501 --> 1:28:53.676
all this figured out.

1:28:53.719 --> 1:28:55.025
-What's Holding?
-It's quiet there.

1:28:55.068 --> 1:28:57.070
Nobody's going to bother you.
-No.

1:28:57.114 --> 1:28:59.551
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't be alone.

1:28:59.595 --> 1:29:01.814
Please.
You can't leave me alone.

1:29:01.858 --> 1:29:03.163
-We're going to need
to revisit all this

1:29:03.207 --> 1:29:04.382
after you get
a little bit of rest.

1:29:04.426 --> 1:29:06.341
-No. Hey. Hey.

1:29:06.384 --> 1:29:08.386
Get your fucking hands off me!

1:29:08.430 --> 1:29:09.692
What the fuck?!

1:29:09.735 --> 1:29:11.171
-Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

1:29:11.215 --> 1:29:13.652
This is not helping.
You need to calm down.

1:29:15.567 --> 1:29:17.874
Can you do that? Huh?

1:29:20.442 --> 1:29:25.534
I'm going to do everything I can
to figure all this out, okay?

1:29:25.577 --> 1:29:27.753
-You owe me that, Allison.

1:29:27.797 --> 1:29:32.845
You know me.
You know me. Not her.

1:29:32.889 --> 1:29:36.153
-Okay. She'll stay here.
Just you and me.

1:29:36.196 --> 1:29:38.416
Okay?

1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:40.200
Come on.

1:29:54.998 --> 1:29:57.174
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

1:29:57.217 --> 1:29:58.828
-Hey.

1:29:58.871 --> 1:30:00.569
Did her urine come back yet?

1:30:00.612 --> 1:30:02.701
-Yeah, she's clean.
Nothing on board.

1:30:02.745 --> 1:30:04.094
-And Wyatt?

1:30:04.137 --> 1:30:05.835
-Just got off the phone
with his P.O.

1:30:05.878 --> 1:30:08.751
Said he's been MIA for weeks.
There's an active warrant.

1:30:08.794 --> 1:30:11.449
-Hm.
-Do you think she did him?

1:30:11.493 --> 1:30:13.190
-No body, no murder.

1:30:13.233 --> 1:30:16.498
But she's washing somebody's
blood off her in there.

1:30:16.541 --> 1:30:18.717
No way to know
till the labs come back.

1:30:40.478 --> 1:30:43.873
-You're not going to find him.
He's gone.

1:30:43.916 --> 1:30:45.570
It took him.

1:30:45.614 --> 1:30:47.703
-Okay. Okay.

1:30:48.921 --> 1:30:51.010
-You got to believe me.

1:30:56.015 --> 1:30:57.364
-Just give me a little bit
of time

1:30:57.408 --> 1:30:59.889
to figure all this out, okay?

1:31:01.064 --> 1:31:03.370
We really are in this together.

1:31:05.895 --> 1:31:07.592
-Don't leave.
-Door.

1:31:07.636 --> 1:31:09.507
-I won't be long.

1:31:09.551 --> 1:31:11.683
-You can't leave me
in this fucking place, Allison!

1:31:11.727 --> 1:31:12.945
I mean, what the fuck?!

1:31:12.989 --> 1:31:14.207
-You are safe in here. Okay?

1:31:14.251 --> 1:31:16.383
This is just how it has to be.

1:31:16.427 --> 1:31:19.517
-Didn't you hear
a fucking word that I just said?

1:31:19.561 --> 1:31:22.564
You cannot leave me
in here alone.

1:31:22.607 --> 1:31:24.914
That thing is coming from me.

1:31:26.219 --> 1:31:28.395
It's like I let it out.

1:31:28.439 --> 1:31:32.138
Allison, I fucked the whole
thing up, and I let it out.

1:31:32.182 --> 1:31:35.881
-I'm not going to let anything
bad happen to you, I promise.

1:31:35.925 --> 1:31:38.449
-Just try to get some sleep.

1:31:38.493 --> 1:31:40.582
I'll be back soon.

1:31:40.625 --> 1:31:43.236
I will.

1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:46.326
Allison! Allison, no!

1:31:47.937 --> 1:31:49.982
It wants me to carry it!

1:31:50.026 --> 1:31:53.769
Allison, please!

1:31:53.812 --> 1:31:56.511
Allison!

1:32:04.388 --> 1:32:05.868
I'm so sorry.

1:32:05.911 --> 1:32:08.087
I tried.

1:32:08.131 --> 1:32:10.046
Please don't come.

1:32:10.437 --> 1:32:14.137
Please. Please don't come.
I'm so sorry. I tried.

1:32:23.102 --> 1:32:25.670
Hello?

1:32:25.714 --> 1:32:28.717
Anybody?

1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:32.459
God damn it!
Can somebody help me?

1:32:32.503 --> 1:32:35.593
Hi. Hi, um...hi.

1:32:35.637 --> 1:32:39.118
I need, um --

1:32:42.644 --> 1:32:46.778
Do you happen to know if Allison
is coming back soon?

1:32:46.822 --> 1:32:50.608
Do you think that
I could get your help?

1:32:50.652 --> 1:32:53.480
-You hurt?

1:32:53.524 --> 1:32:55.221
-No.
-Need the restroom?

1:32:55.265 --> 1:32:58.660
-I think that there might
be something in here with me.

1:32:59.661 --> 1:33:02.925
And I need your help.

1:33:05.362 --> 1:33:07.494
Please.

1:33:11.020 --> 1:33:13.196
No, please don't go!

1:33:13.239 --> 1:33:16.634
No, please! I need your help!

1:33:16.678 --> 1:33:18.375
Please don't leave me!

1:33:18.418 --> 1:33:20.072
I need your help!

1:33:20.116 --> 1:33:22.422
-Go, child.

1:33:24.033 --> 1:33:26.165
Sit.

1:33:26.209 --> 1:33:28.690
Let us reason.

1:33:45.402 --> 1:33:47.143
Please!

1:34:48.378 --> 1:34:53.644
-You hold the blood so that
I may be made of flesh.

1:34:53.688 --> 1:34:58.083
You endured grief.

1:34:58.127 --> 1:35:02.261
Sweet, sweet grief.

1:35:06.222 --> 1:35:10.530
Lest we forget, pain.

1:35:13.795 --> 1:35:18.190
Let not regret also take
residence within you.

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:25.850
Does not a boy need its mother?

1:35:35.251 --> 1:35:38.776
We've come to the end, child.

1:35:38.820 --> 1:35:41.910
No sanctuary to be had.

1:35:42.780 --> 1:35:47.393
Payment is all that remains.

1:35:49.961 --> 1:35:53.008
Take me in.

1:35:53.051 --> 1:35:58.491
Deliver me to a broken soul.

1:36:04.671 --> 1:36:07.065
The boy...

1:36:09.633 --> 1:36:11.983
...calls to you.

1:36:30.045 --> 1:36:33.483
-Found you, Mr. Magoo.

1:37:10.433 --> 1:37:12.435
-Boo!
