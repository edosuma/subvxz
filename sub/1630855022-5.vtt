WEBVTT

00:44.378 --> 00:46.588
- It was a joke, Giorgio.
- Okay.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.049
"Orgio's"? How is that funny?

00:49.049 --> 00:52.719
No, it was "Orgio's." As in orgy.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.932
Okay. Well, if I didn't get that,
no one's gonna get that.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.308
It's not even accessible humor.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.686
Can you just cut her some slack?

01:01.311 --> 01:02.980
I mean, the funeral was yesterday.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.608
I know that, Dust. Okay?
I know that she's hurting.

01:06.608 --> 01:11.446
But she's hurting me and the entire town
by making a joke out of a beautiful sign.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.991
Hey, what's the verdict?

01:13.991 --> 01:16.201
Look, I think I'm just gonna
cut her some slack.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.663
Her boyfriend just died. And I think
we all need to keep that in mind, Big D.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.208
- Thank you so much, Giorgio.
- Stop.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.419
You don't need to thank me, Cass.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.841
Thank you, Giorgio.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.428
How about you? You got anything to say?

01:58.827 --> 02:02.247
Listen, Trina, I know it's been
a few months, but it's Kolton's birthday.

02:02.998 --> 02:05.542
Do you feel like you have
the support you need?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.961
Have you talked to your mom or your dad?

02:09.545 --> 02:11.757
No, I basically told them to fuck off

02:11.757 --> 02:14.134
after they were being
all smothery this summer.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.096
What about friends?

02:18.096 --> 02:21.016
Well, they just talk at me. Or about me.

02:21.016 --> 02:26.021
Like I'm this brave, perfect widow.
Like I'm the fucking Virgin Mary.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.482
No offense.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.570
- You get a pass.
- I don't deserve a pass.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.574
You're being too hard on yourself, Trina.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.826
How would you know?

02:42.955 --> 02:47.042
When a loved one dies,
it's natural to experience guilt.

02:47.543 --> 02:51.505
And there's always gonna be things
that you wished you had said or done.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.968
You'll always struggle to forgive yourself
for wasting what little time you had.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.681
But a car accident? It's a tragedy.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.350
For Kolton and for you, Trina.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.019
There's no way you
could've seen that coming.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.230
I think if you knew the situation,

03:08.230 --> 03:10.899
you'd be okay with me
feeling a little bit of guilt.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.818
You wanna tell me the situation?

03:17.155 --> 03:18.657
Well, maybe you need to tell someone.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.620
You might find that people are
more forgiving than you think.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.796
It's not what it looks like.
I'm cheating on my wife.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.883
I believe you, but you're the coach
of the basketball team.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.761
So, unless you're gonna go on record
and say that you're having an affair,

03:39.761 --> 03:42.014
- I gotta let you go.
- I couldn't do that to Vicky.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.099
Your wife deserves to know.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.185
Vicky's not my wife.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.729
Okay, men are hell.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.648
I'm gonna need your resignation
by the end of today.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.652
Afternoon, Coach.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.740
I go away for a few days, and what,
y'all shit your pants?

03:59.740 --> 04:03.118
- What did I do?
- You got a tattoo on school property?

04:03.118 --> 04:05.871
Well, I got a half a tattoo
from Nurse Munro

04:05.871 --> 04:08.081
because her card said "Tattoo Artist."

04:08.081 --> 04:11.877
- And I thought she'd be good with needles.
- Jesus Christ, Dusty.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.838
Yeah, I'm sorry. I got it for Cass.

04:14.838 --> 04:18.841
We've been having
some ups and downs lately.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.221
I get it. Marriage is tough.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.807
- You've been married for eight minutes.
- I got a suggestion.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.184
All right.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.604
Take Cass away for the weekend. Okay?
Martha and Rose's Inn.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.689
- I just went there for my honeymoon.
- I--

04:32.689 --> 04:34.775
They just renovated the whole place.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.569
It's incredible.
It feels like you really got away. Okay?

04:37.569 --> 04:39.363
Here. Here's a 10% coupon.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.698
You use that 'cause I get 10% off too.
All right?

04:41.698 --> 04:44.117
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Okay. Go get your woman. All right.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.786
Yeah, you got this!

04:49.248 --> 04:51.875
Hey. Any fun birthday plans?

04:51.875 --> 04:54.878
Movie night with my dad. So, no.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.423
Want me to come over?
I could be a Beau buffer.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.467
A "Beau-ffer."

05:02.678 --> 05:04.471
Yeah, no. I appreciate the offer

05:04.471 --> 05:06.932
but wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.016
Hey, Jacob.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.601
Hey.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.729
I gotta go.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.273
Okay, cool!

05:14.982 --> 05:18.610
It is so hot how he always,
like, has to go.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.070
It's so mysterious.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.823
I wonder if he's going to Megan's.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.701
Is Megan having a thing tonight?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.996
No. I mean, not, like, a thing.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.081
She might be having some people--

05:31.832 --> 05:33.709
You know, I don't even think she is, actually.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.755
"Trina knows about Megan's party.
What should I do?"

05:39.381 --> 05:40.799
Oh, no. That's--

05:40.799 --> 05:42.426
I was just being funny.

05:43.594 --> 05:47.639
Look, it's not personal. It's just,
like, awkward if you're, like, mourning,

05:47.639 --> 05:49.683
and we're all laughing and having fun.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.020
I just don't know how to be around you.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.731
Yeah, I'm getting that.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.035
<i>So, Trina, does this mean
you miss me? Because that's very cute.</i>

06:08.035 --> 06:09.536
No. I'm just surprised.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.914
I really thought you guys would
be here tonight.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.373
<i>Why? What's tonight?</i>

06:15.542 --> 06:16.668
Friday.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.003
<i>Well, in shocking news,</i>

06:18.003 --> 06:20.130
<i>your mum and dad have plans
on a Friday night.</i>

06:20.130 --> 06:22.549
<i>Did you not see the note?
I left it on the dining room table.</i>

06:22.549 --> 06:25.761
Yeah, why send a text when you could
bury a note under Mom's art crap?

06:25.761 --> 06:27.387
<i>Hey, it's not art crap.</i>

06:27.888 --> 06:28.972
Wait, Mom's with you?

06:28.972 --> 06:31.767
Well, your dad is surprising me.

06:31.767 --> 06:35.687
But, sweetie, we can come back
if, you know, if you wanna hang?

06:35.687 --> 06:37.356
You know, it's fine.

06:37.356 --> 06:40.234
I'm actually really glad to
have the house to myself.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.362
I'll just throw a rager of a party
and destroy all your stuff.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.655
Don't call the cops, okay?

06:44.655 --> 06:47.991
- <i>Okay, that tracks. Have fun.</i>
- <i>Okay, teapot! I love you so much!</i>

06:49.952 --> 06:52.704
You think she's fine? It's not like her
to want to hang with us.

06:52.704 --> 06:56.375
Yeah, she said she was fine.
I, for one, trust our daughter.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.253
Okay. So are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

06:59.253 --> 07:02.047
No, that's for me to know
and for you to find out.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.550
- "Martha and Rose's Inn"?
- What? No.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.218
I just saw the coupon.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.845
Dusty, if I knew
that's where we were going,

07:07.845 --> 07:09.555
- I would not have come.
- Okay.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.890
Look, I know that
you think that Martha hates you.

07:11.890 --> 07:15.018
But I saw the way that she was
looking at you at the wedding.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.771
If you hated someone,
would you look at them?

07:17.771 --> 07:18.939
Probably!

07:19.690 --> 07:21.316
She left my mom because of me.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.943
- No, she did not. No--
- Yes!

07:22.943 --> 07:25.237
Cass, she left your mom
because she didn't want to have kids.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.739
You just happened to be
that kid in the scenario.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.868
And it was years ago.
We're all adults now.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.954
Which is why I wanted to take you
for a little adult getaway.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.956
- You know?
- Yeah.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.750
Show you that I can still
spice things up a bit.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.335
I mean, what could be more spicy

07:40.335 --> 07:44.298
than finding out that you were
part of an all-boys dance troupe. I mean...

07:45.048 --> 07:46.466
Oh, my gosh.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.094
What have they done
with the place?

07:49.094 --> 07:51.388
Well, it's just like it says
on the coupon, Cass.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.558
"All the fun of a cruise ship
with none of the travel."

07:54.558 --> 07:59.313
Hello! Welcome to the Cruisin' Cruise Inn!

07:59.313 --> 08:01.148
We're so glad to have you
on board with us,

08:01.148 --> 08:03.317
and we do hope you'll recommend us
to your friends.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.694
- Thanks.
- The renovations aren't quite complete,

08:05.694 --> 08:07.988
but we have already been recognized

08:07.988 --> 08:10.782
as the number one
nautical-based hotel in Deerfield!

08:11.783 --> 08:14.995
And if we recommend you,
we get an additional 10% off.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.079
That's right, isn't it?

08:16.079 --> 08:20.334
Dinner tonight is going to be
at 1700 hours in the main dining room.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.711
- And before you head to your cabin...
- Dining room.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.588
...everyone is required to read
the safety manual.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.798
When did my dad do this?

08:26.798 --> 08:29.801
"O Captain! My Captain!"
That's you when you're older.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.553
He looks like a stripper on a houseboat.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.847
Captain Rose,
I think we can skip the safety manual,

08:34.847 --> 08:36.558
at least until we get that moat.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.018
Right. Thank you.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.105
Hi, Martha.

08:42.773 --> 08:43.815
Hi, Cass.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.987
Look at you two looking at each other.
It's good.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.614
Why don't I show you to your room?

08:50.614 --> 08:53.534
I don't understand.
Is this all, like, a MORPHO thing?

08:53.534 --> 08:56.370
Actually, no. We've been
working on the renovations for months.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.539
Rose loves cruise ships,

08:58.539 --> 09:00.707
but she's deathly afraid of the ocean.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.751
And I've always been
a bit of a homebody anyway,

09:02.751 --> 09:05.462
and so this is our compromise.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.381
Great.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.300
Evening, Coach.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.055
A lot of people
have been coming here to get away.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.225
Business has tripled
since the renovations,

09:18.225 --> 09:21.603
so I apologize.
This is the last room we have left.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.064
Oh, yay. We got the last room.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.653
It is one of our more... authentic rooms.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.239
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.575
- The "Crew's Quarters."
- Okay.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.410
Rose insisted that we plug the windows

09:36.410 --> 09:38.453
so that you really feel
like you're below deck.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.622
- That's very effective.
- And what else?

09:41.832 --> 09:43.000
The light switch is by the door.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.712
It should just switch on and off
for when you need light.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.630
- Ooh la la.
- A light. That's great.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.091
I really wish we had
something a little fancier for you.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.719
This is perfect.

09:53.719 --> 09:54.845
Thank you.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.889
- Thank you, Martha.
- Okay.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.017
Yeah.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.810
- Do you believe that she hates me?
- What?

10:01.810 --> 10:03.937
Come on. Seriously?
This has got to be the worst room.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.439
I don't know. The worst room?

10:05.439 --> 10:07.191
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.151
How about a little bit of role-play?

10:09.735 --> 10:10.736
Yeah.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.948
- We could be deck workers. Yes!
- Okay.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.700
And we're stressed and overworked,

10:16.700 --> 10:19.161
and I gotta wear this
'cause we're all about to drown.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.621
It's your last night.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.123
I think I'm only gonna drown
'cause you took the last vest.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.542
So I don't know. Maybe you should stop
turning me on so much.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.002
- Oh, yeah. You like that?
- I do.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.879
I hope so
'cause I don't think I can get it off.

10:28.879 --> 10:29.963
Oh, shit. Okay.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.466
Yeah, I think it's digging in.
The more I--

10:39.056 --> 10:41.683
Hey. I thought you were gonna
be at Megan's tonight?

10:41.683 --> 10:42.768
Well, yeah.

10:42.768 --> 10:45.938
Apparently, I'm either too brave
or too morbid to be at parties.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.147
Not sure which.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.360
Well, if it's the latter,
then you'll fit right in here.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.111
Happy birthday.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.783
- It's an ashtray.
- Of course it is.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.619
- I love it.
- Thanks.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.955
- Oh, shit. Jesus.
- What the fuck did you do?

11:02.955 --> 11:04.957
- I don't know. I was just pick--
- I don't--

11:06.792 --> 11:09.211
- I'm just kidding. It was already broken.
- So mean.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.380
- Here.
- 100% fell for it.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.091
Jesus.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.975
- A little dark given the circumstances.
- I think it's sick.

11:22.975 --> 11:25.185
I, like, made it with my mom's craft shit.

11:26.562 --> 11:27.688
What'd you get me?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.857
What did I get you for my birthday?

11:33.151 --> 11:34.653
I got you a card too.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.581
Where'd you get this?

11:45.581 --> 11:48.959
It was from the machine. I don't know.
I think it's like a sample or something.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.962
It kind of just spat out a few blanks
when it was first starting up.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.257
You know, you could, like,
write whatever you want on here

11:55.257 --> 11:57.176
and tell people that's what you got.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.139
Yeah.
Kind of wish I thought of that earlier.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.436
What do you think Kolton would have got?

12:09.521 --> 12:12.274
Well, "Angel," obviously. Right?

12:12.274 --> 12:13.650
Obviously.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.776
I don't know.

12:15.277 --> 12:18.280
He could be a real dick sometimes.
Like, he used to take my shit.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.033
Like, my mom got me a Switch,
and then it just disappeared.

12:21.033 --> 12:24.369
And she blamed me, of course,
but I knew he took it.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.289
I logged back into my account.
My username was changed to like...

12:28.040 --> 12:29.541
Penis69.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.418
Which is a great name, in his defense.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.129
I mean, that's just a small thing,
but as an example.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.214
I know.

12:35.214 --> 12:36.882
And you and I only started hanging out

12:36.882 --> 12:40.427
because he was always bailing on you
to go drink with his boys or...

12:45.766 --> 12:49.561
I don't think that was, like, the
only reason why we started hanging out.

12:50.979 --> 12:54.858
I know. And I know
there were obviously good parts too,

12:54.858 --> 12:58.278
but with everyone calling him an angel,

12:59.738 --> 13:01.865
it's really hard to remember those.

13:05.827 --> 13:11.124
Seafaring passengers,
I hold before you an ordinary napkin,

13:11.124 --> 13:14.920
like any of the napkins you will find
at your tables.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.340
However, like the tides of the ocean,

13:18.340 --> 13:22.928
this ordinary napkin can quickly...

13:25.180 --> 13:26.306
change.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.602
Thank you.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.982
I'll be right back!
After a quick, magic 15.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.697
Well, you gotta admire the guy's
commitment to his MORPHO card.

13:43.115 --> 13:46.076
But it could be argued that
it's just as admirable to do something

13:46.076 --> 13:48.328
regardless of what it says on a card.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.330
Like Martha and Rose
and their beautiful ship.

13:51.498 --> 13:56.503
Some might argue that the cards
help unlock the magic within us.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.006
Is that right? What do you do, Glen?

13:59.715 --> 14:01.300
I work at the electric company.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.386
But then I got a card
that said "Photographer."

14:06.388 --> 14:07.806
So, what do you photograph?

14:07.806 --> 14:11.185
Trees mostly. I love tree bark.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.270
It's nature's scabs.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.023
- Magical.
- Yeah. Well, it is for me.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.149
For a long while now,

14:17.149 --> 14:21.195
I've really wanted
to just disappear into the woods

14:21.195 --> 14:23.822
and really delve into my art.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.659
But I was afraid it would--
might affect our relationship.

14:28.994 --> 14:32.372
The MORPHO machine gave me
the confidence to really go for it.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.626
Wow. That's actually really amazing.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.878
So, what did you get--

14:37.878 --> 14:39.796
- I did not get your--
- Hawaii.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.965
- You got "Hawaii"?
- Oh, no.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.800
My name is Hawaii.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.678
- Wow.
- I got "Explorer."

14:47.513 --> 14:50.724
Which obviously means sexual explorer.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.476
Obviously. Yeah.

14:52.476 --> 14:55.854
And once Glen shared
his secret passion for tree bark with me,

14:55.854 --> 14:58.106
I was able to tell him
that I wanted to have sex

14:58.106 --> 15:00.692
with a lot of different people.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.820
So I started going through a bucket list
of sexual activities,

15:03.820 --> 15:06.073
and Glen has been incredibly supportive
through it all.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.157
Oh, stop.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.951
- How many activities?
- Supportive, how?

15:08.951 --> 15:12.829
I started with the easy ones, like DP.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.749
Sorry, double pen.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.917
Double pen?

15:18.836 --> 15:20.170
Sorry. Double penetration.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.382
- Ouch.
- Glen.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.801
You know how it is. You guys are married.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.219
You must've done it all.

15:27.219 --> 15:31.223
- Oh, gosh. How many times?
- Wow. We've done it. A lot.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.683
It's usually just a single pen.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.435
Yeah. Too many cooks and all that.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.647
- So what card did you get?
- I got "Royalty."

15:38.647 --> 15:39.940
Oh, my God.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.150
- That is the best one yet.
- Wow.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.235
Is it?

15:43.235 --> 15:45.779
I mean, I do not know what to do with it.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.949
I just wish I had something like "Biker,"
so I could buy a bike.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.910
Or like "Photographer," so I could just
buy a camera, you know?

15:51.910 --> 15:52.995
Something like that.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.748
Well, I got "Explorer,"
but I didn't go buy a giant sailing ship.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.375
- Yeah.
- Well, that would have been weird.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.296
I just figured out what it meant for me.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.839
Wow.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.092
Hey.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.721
What did I get?
Well, funny you should ask--

16:10.721 --> 16:12.514
Sorry, Dusty.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.309
Didn't mean to interrupt,
but is the floor moving?

16:15.309 --> 16:17.936
Attention, passengers.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.815
We're encountering some choppy waters.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.193
I'll do my best to steer us out.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.570
In the meantime, enjoy the ride.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.488
It's like dinner theater.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.747
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, sport.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.374
Trina's here.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.085
Trina! You came!

16:42.586 --> 16:45.130
That's so great. Here. Get in there.
Have a seat.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.591
We were just about to start movie night.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.218
Can I get you something to eat?

16:49.218 --> 16:51.428
I got some Burly Boy dinners, popcorn--

16:52.095 --> 16:53.096
We can do one beer.

16:54.431 --> 16:55.807
Popcorn would be great. Thank you.

16:55.807 --> 16:56.892
Coming right up.

17:00.521 --> 17:04.900
- So what are we watching?
- Just <i>The Magnificent Seven</i>.

17:04.900 --> 17:05.983
Kolton's fave.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.070
What? What's wrong?

17:09.655 --> 17:11.240
Nothing. I mean, it's--

17:11.740 --> 17:14.242
We can watch it. I just--
I don't think it's his favorite.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.619
I mean, obviously, he liked it.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.414
Yeah, he was kinda weirdly obsessed
with <i>My Best Friend's Wedding</i>.

17:20.874 --> 17:24.086
The Julia Roberts movie?

17:24.086 --> 17:25.170
Yeah.

17:26.505 --> 17:29.216
Well, I like her.

17:29.216 --> 17:33.095
- She's kinda funny, and her face is nice.
- Yeah.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.265
And if that was Kolton's favorite movie,
then that's what we'll watch.

17:36.265 --> 17:38.517
- Okay.
- I'll get the popcorn.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.144
Coming right up!

17:41.144 --> 17:44.731
And to think I was worried about watching
a classic Western alone with my dad.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.235
Now I get to watch an old rom-com
with my dad and my secret girlfriend,

17:48.235 --> 17:51.196
in honor of my dead brother
who you also dated.

17:51.864 --> 17:53.115
Happy birthday.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.741
It is a happy birthday.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.704
So, you see how
the clean lines of the birch

17:58.704 --> 18:01.582
contrast with the soft lines of the moss.

18:01.582 --> 18:02.749
Yeah, breathtaking, Glen.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.460
Listen, can we just circle back
for a second to that convo

18:05.460 --> 18:07.045
- about the sexual bucket list?
- Yeah.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.714
So how does that work?

18:08.714 --> 18:11.925
Like, what does the day-to-day look like
for you on that, Glen?

18:12.926 --> 18:15.179
I'm pretty hands-off.

18:15.179 --> 18:19.099
Hawaii just does whatever with whoever
and I take photos.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.643
So you're there.

18:22.436 --> 18:25.772
No. I take photos of tree bark.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.441
Just the trees. Come on, keep up.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.610
- I will go on a trip for a few days...
- What?

18:29.610 --> 18:31.361
...on a shoot sometimes,

18:31.361 --> 18:33.155
and Hawaii doesn't even get jealous.

18:33.155 --> 18:38.035
I mean, sometimes it's really hard,
but I want to give Glen his independence.

18:38.035 --> 18:38.952
Wow.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.331
That sounds really healthy.

18:42.331 --> 18:45.542
Sorry, what are you--
You mean, like, it's hard on you?

18:45.542 --> 18:49.171
Because it feels like
a more insecure person in Glen's shoes,

18:49.171 --> 18:51.924
they might be worried that
one of your explorations

18:51.924 --> 18:54.593
would take you away from him forever.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.388
All I can say is this.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.225
Ever since Glen and I opened up
to each other,

19:01.225 --> 19:04.186
it's like we've fallen in love
all over again,

19:04.186 --> 19:07.731
but as our true selves,
and we've never been stronger.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.527
And...

19:11.527 --> 19:12.986
We fucked in a tree.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.031
Well, we better make a move, huh?

19:16.031 --> 19:17.658
This has been a delight,

19:18.283 --> 19:20.285
but we're going to retire
to the Crew's Quarters.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.370
Yes.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.249
Crew's Quarters. That sounds like fun.

19:29.545 --> 19:30.546
Wow.

19:31.213 --> 19:34.758
I love it. It's so authentic.

19:35.926 --> 19:40.013
Yeah, we are up in the Captain's Suite,
and it's got this amazing view

19:40.013 --> 19:42.933
that just reminds you
you're not on the ocean.

19:44.101 --> 19:45.102
Want to trade?

19:46.311 --> 19:47.396
Right?

19:51.525 --> 19:53.193
It's getting pretty late, isn't it?

19:53.193 --> 19:55.779
Yeah, I'm actually feeling
a little queasy.

19:55.779 --> 19:56.947
Oh, no.

19:56.947 --> 20:00.075
Glen. You shouldn't have been
looking at your phone on the moving floor.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.159
Oh, Glen.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.203
Yeah,
I think I'm going to call it a night.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.831
- It was nice to meet you.
- Such a shame.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.749
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- The door is right there.

20:07.749 --> 20:08.667
Yeah.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.045
Hope you feel better.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.219
So...

20:21.180 --> 20:22.514
How do you normally do this?

20:24.558 --> 20:26.518
How do we normally do what?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.231
That.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.649
Well, we would normally--

20:32.649 --> 20:35.694
Under normal circumstances,
we would have a private chat first.

20:36.695 --> 20:37.905
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:39.573 --> 20:40.657
Look in there.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.911
Ho! We'll just swing into the en suite.

20:45.662 --> 20:46.914
We'll be right back.

20:46.914 --> 20:48.207
You know what's happening, right?

20:48.207 --> 20:50.334
This is a threesome.
This is how a threesome starts.

20:50.334 --> 20:52.586
I know what's happening.
How do you feel about it?

20:52.586 --> 20:54.087
- How do I feel about it?
- Yeah.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.049
In the past, it was something
that you said wouldn't appeal to you.

20:57.049 --> 21:00.302
I'm appealed. I'm appealed to find out
how you feel about it.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.554
You know, is this something that you've--

21:02.554 --> 21:04.097
Is this something that you've wanted?

21:04.765 --> 21:07.267
'Cause I want you to be able
to share your desires with me, darling.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.853
Sweetie,
I want you to share your desires with me.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.021
How about this?

21:11.021 --> 21:12.397
How about I count to three

21:12.397 --> 21:14.900
and then we both share our secret desires?

21:16.193 --> 21:18.779
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.741
You know what?
It was too wide open, wasn't it?

21:22.741 --> 21:24.743
- It's Pandora's box. Okay, so...
- Sorry, I was late.

21:24.743 --> 21:27.162
I'm just going to say
"threesome" on three,

21:27.162 --> 21:29.122
and you say whatever pops into your head.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.416
One, two, threesome!

21:31.416 --> 21:32.501
- Dusty, listen.
- Yeah.

21:32.501 --> 21:33.585
You know what?

21:33.585 --> 21:36.463
- I wasn't expecting that to happen, right?
- No.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.881
- Okay?
- No.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.800
But you know what?

21:39.800 --> 21:42.135
We have been talking about
broadening our horizons, right?

21:42.135 --> 21:43.220
Yeah.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.430
And this is something
we'd be doing together.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.975
- Yeah.
- Look. I'm good either way.

21:47.975 --> 21:50.477
No! Cass is in for the threesome.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.104
Yes! Yay!

21:52.604 --> 21:56.400
I can finally cross having a threesome
with an older couple off my list.

21:58.569 --> 22:01.947
Start doing what you normally do,
and I'll watch.

22:01.947 --> 22:03.031
Like at home?

22:03.031 --> 22:04.199
Yeah.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.911
- Well, we wou--
- Well, normally what we would do is--

22:07.911 --> 22:10.539
- You would turn off the lights downstairs...
- Bingo!

22:10.539 --> 22:12.457
- Turn off the lights. Get that done.
- ...secure the alarm.

22:12.457 --> 22:13.959
- That's right.
- That's hot.

22:13.959 --> 22:16.712
- And then you would brush your teeth.
- Yes. My teeth.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.630
I love to brush my teeth and gargle.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.965
- Minty fresh.
- Dental hygiene.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.259
Then I do a little--

22:22.259 --> 22:24.136
I don't think that-- Do I do that?

22:24.136 --> 22:26.972
Usually not with the back of your hand,
but it's the hand.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.056
- Hand-to-face...
- Yeah.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.266
- ...and hand-to-body.
- A little of the hand.

22:30.559 --> 22:32.060
- Some of that.
- He likes a good massage.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.521
- Yeah.
- He wears a cross-shoulder bag for work.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.357
I get a lot of issues in my T7,
so she'll kinda do a bit of that.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.442
Like that.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.694
Yeah. Let's do it.

22:41.278 --> 22:42.821
- Then I can't have sex...
- No.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.114
...without taking off my pants.

22:44.865 --> 22:46.909
- Here we go.
- Let's get these little guys off.

22:46.909 --> 22:48.619
Here comes the surprise!

22:50.787 --> 22:51.830
We're warming up.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.831
Oh, shit!

22:53.790 --> 22:55.584
- Fuck!
- Are you okay?

22:56.418 --> 22:57.669
Fuck. My ankle.

22:57.669 --> 23:00.464
Why did you try to take off your pants
before your shoes?

23:00.464 --> 23:02.508
I don't know. I don't wear shoes at home.

23:02.508 --> 23:03.634
That's definitely a sprain.

23:03.634 --> 23:05.886
Sweetie, please do not move. Okay?

23:05.886 --> 23:08.931
I'm going to go get some ice.
Oh, my goodness.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.188
What's that on your ass?

23:23.779 --> 23:26.365
We're supposed to side
with Julia Roberts in this?

23:26.365 --> 23:29.409
She spends the whole movie
trying to ruin her friend's wedding.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.453
It's actually her best friend's wedding.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.331
Well, she is not a best friend.
I'll tell you that.

23:34.915 --> 23:37.751
I gotta say,
I don't see a ton of Kolton in this.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.837
- Well...
- I think Mom put him onto it.

23:40.838 --> 23:42.673
Yeah, he used to help Mom
with the laundry.

23:42.673 --> 23:44.216
They'd always have a movie on.

23:44.216 --> 23:48.095
I also feel like
he just kinda liked late '90s rom-coms.

23:48.679 --> 23:50.681
He knew most of the monologues
in <i>Jerry Maguire</i>,

23:50.681 --> 23:52.057
and there were a lot of monologues.

23:52.057 --> 23:55.018
Yeah, but he would do them
in, like, a funny way.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.687
Kolton with the jokes.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.147
He got that from his old man.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.984
Yeah. And, like, the "Orgio's" thing?

24:01.984 --> 24:03.610
That's what Kolton used to call it.

24:04.194 --> 24:10.325
So, when I, like, smashed in the sign,
that was kind of like an homage.

24:11.368 --> 24:14.913
Oh, man. You two made such a great pair.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.749
I never saw him happier
than when he was with you.

24:23.422 --> 24:24.840
I'm gonna make more popcorn.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.216
- Want me to help?
- Jacob's got it.

24:54.411 --> 24:55.412
Don't jump.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.332
Sorry, do you need something?

24:58.332 --> 25:00.375
Towels? Dramamine?

25:00.959 --> 25:03.712
No, I was just getting some ice.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.547
Okay.

25:12.304 --> 25:13.472
How are you?

25:14.681 --> 25:15.682
I'm fine.

25:16.600 --> 25:20.604
I mean, I'm stressed,
but that comes with the territory.

25:21.188 --> 25:23.440
One of our guests just threw up
in the Captain's Suite.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.108
Oh, yeah, poor Glen.

25:28.070 --> 25:32.157
To be honest, Cass, having you here is--

25:33.200 --> 25:35.661
I almost tried to talk to you
at the wedding.

25:37.746 --> 25:39.748
Couldn't seem to find the right moment.

25:40.249 --> 25:41.458
Yeah, I get it.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.877
I mean, there were
a lot of surprise dance numbers

25:43.877 --> 25:45.170
to compete with, so...

25:47.130 --> 25:48.465
I think about you a lot.

25:49.508 --> 25:51.885
You know, what you're up to.
How you're doing.

25:55.055 --> 25:57.140
I'm doing fine.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.977
I'm selling sweatshirts.

25:59.977 --> 26:01.812
Well, I'm not surprised.

26:02.521 --> 26:04.690
You were always so creative.

26:07.276 --> 26:11.572
I'm sorry,
I don't know what's going on right now.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.992
- Don't you hate me?
- Hate you?

26:14.992 --> 26:20.163
Yeah. I mean, we haven't
talked in, like, a lot of years.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.500
And, like, I know that
I'm the reason you and my mom broke up,

26:23.500 --> 26:24.960
because you didn't wanna have kids, and--

26:24.960 --> 26:26.211
That's what she told you?

26:28.547 --> 26:30.716
Of course that's what she told you.

26:31.675 --> 26:34.011
I'm sorry.
I don't want to talk ill of your mother.

26:34.011 --> 26:36.847
Oh, no. Please talk shit.

26:36.847 --> 26:39.892
Izzy and I had our issues
long before we moved to Deerfield,

26:39.892 --> 26:41.935
but they had nothing to do with you.

26:43.312 --> 26:47.191
I thought after we moved here,
and she put her dance career behind her,

26:47.191 --> 26:48.942
things would be different,

26:50.152 --> 26:51.236
but Mayor Izzy.

26:53.322 --> 26:54.364
I know.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.243
In the end, I was the one who left.

27:00.245 --> 27:03.498
But I begged Izzy to still have
a relationship with you.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.793
She told me you didn't want that.

27:08.712 --> 27:11.215
So I respected your wishes.

27:15.886 --> 27:17.054
Those were not my--

27:20.974 --> 27:22.518
Those were not my wishes.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.781
- Fun Friday night, right?
- Yeah.

27:35.781 --> 27:38.242
Watching old movies
in the basement with me.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.662
Well, at least it wasn't
<i>The Magnificent Seven</i>,

27:41.662 --> 27:43.747
which apparently is
only my favorite movie.

27:43.747 --> 27:46.083
Like Jacob said,
I'm sure Kolton liked it too.

27:50.170 --> 27:52.089
People never talk to me about him.

27:54.007 --> 27:55.759
When they do, it's the same shit.

28:00.013 --> 28:02.891
But you really knew him. You know?

28:03.684 --> 28:04.685
And I...

28:07.938 --> 28:09.898
I couldn't even tell you
his favorite color.

28:13.318 --> 28:14.778
I think he liked yellow.

28:16.113 --> 28:17.906
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:17.906 --> 28:21.410
Well, that's a good choice.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.709
You probably learned more about Kolton
in a year than I did in my whole life.

28:30.085 --> 28:31.086
That's not true.

28:32.921 --> 28:33.922
I should...

28:35.507 --> 28:37.968
I should have made the effort
while I could.

28:39.469 --> 28:40.888
I feel like I failed him.

28:50.189 --> 28:51.773
I failed him too, Mr. Kovac.

28:51.773 --> 28:52.941
No, you didn't.

28:53.442 --> 28:54.568
I'm a liar.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.696
It's what I got on my card. "Liar."

28:57.696 --> 28:58.780
What?

29:00.073 --> 29:01.909
You think you're a shitty dad?

29:03.368 --> 29:05.662
Well, I was an even shittier girlfriend.

29:07.247 --> 29:08.707
I cheated on Kolton.

29:20.886 --> 29:22.763
- I'm so sorry.
- I think you should go.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.267
I'm really sorry.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.992
I wouldn't worry about it.
There's only seven little dots.

29:43.992 --> 29:47.037
Seven?
Last time I checked, there was five.

29:49.581 --> 29:52.793
Cass, hey. This isn't what it looks like.

29:54.795 --> 29:58.674
I just wanna go home, if it's okay.

29:59.341 --> 30:01.510
Yeah, of course.

30:02.761 --> 30:04.137
I'm sorry, Hawaii.

30:04.721 --> 30:05.973
It's totally fine.

30:07.140 --> 30:10.102
Let's just quickly exchange numbers
and find another time?

30:20.320 --> 30:21.822
It's okay.

30:28.328 --> 30:29.997
I want to get to know you, Jacob.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.042
I don't want us to have secrets anymore.

30:36.170 --> 30:39.715
You know Trina cheated on Kolton?

30:47.514 --> 30:48.599
No.

30:48.599 --> 30:49.808
I sent her home.

30:52.853 --> 30:54.646
It's just you and me now, partner.
