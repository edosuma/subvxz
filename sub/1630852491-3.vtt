WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.670
Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.703 --> 00:05.005
You and Tiffany staying in
and studying, right?

00:05.039 --> 00:06.740
'Cause I'm keeping
close contact.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.242
You got my number, Commander.

00:08.276 --> 00:09.743
What awaits you in Boston?

00:11.412 --> 00:13.147
DEJA:
My boyfriend.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.548
They want to reboot
The Manny, Kevin.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.350
You'd play the dad.
You get to raise your family

00:16.384 --> 00:18.386
in Los Angeles
and become a zillionaire.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.321
You know, people said
I was crazy,

00:20.354 --> 00:22.756
me living in your garage
just to stay close to the twins.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.558
It's possible they had a point.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.494
I hate that I'm doing this
over FaceTime, but I miss you.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.495
I miss you, too.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.996
(chuckles)

00:29.029 --> 00:32.032
Are you aware that Kevin
is in our guest room?

00:32.066 --> 00:34.001
I'm taking The Manny reboot.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.536
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:35.569 --> 00:38.106
-Jack Damon.
-(audience cheering)

00:41.275 --> 00:43.111
("Serenity Now"
by Brett Dennen playing)

00:44.978 --> 00:47.548
* Serenity now *

00:47.581 --> 00:50.684
* I'm leaving, I believe... *

00:50.718 --> 00:53.121
I can feel your concern.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.389
Blind guy, hot smoker.

00:55.423 --> 00:58.859
I assure you, I have done this
hundreds of times,

00:58.892 --> 01:01.195
-and I still have
both my eyebrows.
-(chuckling)

01:01.229 --> 01:03.397
Wait, do I still have
both of them?

01:03.431 --> 01:05.099
So far, so good.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.967
* I live on a boat *

01:07.000 --> 01:09.570
* I seldom sail *

01:09.603 --> 01:13.040
* I'm a captain with no crew *

01:13.073 --> 01:15.876
* A man *

01:15.909 --> 01:19.147
* Collecting moments as they *

01:19.180 --> 01:21.215
* Come... *

01:21.249 --> 01:22.650
You okay?

01:22.683 --> 01:25.886
(clears throat) Yeah.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.955
I know it sounds crazy,
but every once in a while,

01:27.988 --> 01:30.991
that smell hits me and...
takes me right back to that day.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.295
I know.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.608
TOBY:
Don't-don't get
too close, buddy.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.043
No. No, no, no.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.781
KATE:
Jack!

01:53.814 --> 01:54.882
LUCY:
Jack?

01:55.983 --> 01:57.151
I'm good.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.187
-Mm-hmm.
-(clears throat)

01:59.220 --> 02:01.655
-Hell of a first memory, huh?
-Yeah.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.692
(clears throat)
Hope you're hungry.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.595
-Made enough for a small army.
-(chuckles)

02:07.628 --> 02:09.463
*

02:23.811 --> 02:25.946
(sighs) Oh, God...
I missed them again.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.216
-I'm sorry.
-(groans)

02:28.249 --> 02:31.185
I tried to keep them up as long
as I could, but they were wiped.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.620
They're not gonna remember
who I am.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.822
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.890
Nobody forgets that face.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.360
Look, you could cover it with
as much facial hair as you want.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.528
It doesn't even matter.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.864
How did I become that dad?

02:43.897 --> 02:46.200
Like, the guy who leaves
before breakfast

02:46.234 --> 02:47.468
and gets home after dinner.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.070
My dad worked a lot.
I still love him.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.972
Yeah, comparing me
to your father doesn't help.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.208
How would you like it
if I compared you to my mom?

02:54.242 --> 02:56.877
Oh, okay. Point taken.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.713
Babe, why don't you...

02:59.747 --> 03:01.014
I don't know,
why don't you carve out

03:01.048 --> 03:02.316
some time for them this weekend

03:02.350 --> 03:04.385
and give them
the full Jack experience?

03:04.418 --> 03:05.986
Mm-hmm.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.988
Oh, you already thought
of the Jack experience?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.723
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, go ahead.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.924
You know that new mall
they just built?

03:10.958 --> 03:12.560
The one with the indoor
movie theater?

03:12.593 --> 03:15.896
(gasps) Oh, their first
movie on a big screen.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.598
It's perfect.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.967
They're gonna love it.
You're gonna have so much fun.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.936
Y-You're not gonna come?

03:22.970 --> 03:25.773
An entire Saturday
with three squirming kids

03:25.806 --> 03:27.775
all hopped up on sugar?

03:27.808 --> 03:29.777
-Don't count on it, babe.
-(pats leg)

03:31.879 --> 03:33.581
TOBY:
All right.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.349
Off to make the bacon.

03:35.383 --> 03:39.052
T-minus four days
until I see you guys again.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.121
-All right.
-All right.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.357
-Well, we love you.
-We, uh, love you.

03:43.391 --> 03:46.260
-We love you.
-Oh, my gosh, I love you, too.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.562
Love you.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.564
-KATE: We'll miss you.
-(crying)
-Aw. Not today.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.132
-KATE: I know.
-I'll be back.
I'll be right back.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.767
-KATE: Bye, Dad.
-JACK: Bye, Dad.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.536
* It's not time
to make a change *

03:55.569 --> 03:59.373
* Just relax, take it easy *

03:59.407 --> 04:01.709
* You're still young,
that's your fault *

04:01.742 --> 04:03.644
* There's so much... *

04:03.677 --> 04:05.946
Hey, buddy, let's just, uh,
let's kind of blow our kisses

04:05.979 --> 04:08.749
and say our "I love you's..."
Hey-hey... oh.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.252
Sorry, you know what?
He's melting down, sorry.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.621
Yeah, but he didn't get
a chance to hear me say

04:13.654 --> 04:15.155
that-that I love him.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.858
* I am old, but I'm happy *

04:20.127 --> 04:21.895
* I was once... *

04:21.929 --> 04:23.731
Yeah, I couldn't g-- I couldn't
get out of that dinner

04:23.764 --> 04:25.799
tomorrow night, so hopefully it
won't go too late and I'll just

04:25.833 --> 04:28.402
-hop on the first flight
in the morning.
-Well, that's a bummer.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.903
I was just hoping
that you would be here

04:29.937 --> 04:31.405
to help me with the kids,
you know?

04:31.439 --> 04:33.341
By the end of the week
I'm just fried.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.908
Yeah, I'm doing
the best I can, Kate.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.744
I know.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.980
And you're traveling back
and forth, and I--

04:40.013 --> 04:42.015
babe, we really appreciate it.

04:42.049 --> 04:45.152
A dad's work is never done.

04:45.185 --> 04:48.021
-(alarm chiming)
-* But your dreams may not *

04:53.026 --> 04:55.796
* It's not time
to make a change... *

04:55.829 --> 04:57.431
-Good morning.
-KEVIN: Good morning.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.667
Here you go, matcha
with monk fruit and nut milk,

04:59.700 --> 05:01.602
-just like you like
your nonsense.
-Come on in.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.972
We'll fuel them up with the
breakfast of champions: yams.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.708
-KEVIN: Good morning.
-Thank God you're here.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.777
Double blowout.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.145
Well, yams.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.681
* Everything you've got... *

05:13.714 --> 05:16.384
-Morning.
-Shh. We had a rough night.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.185
They're already back asleep,
but you can go peek.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.955
* But your dreams may not *

05:21.989 --> 05:24.958
* How can I try to explain? *

05:24.992 --> 05:29.530
* 'Cause when I do,
he turns away again *

05:29.563 --> 05:32.500
* It's always been the same *

05:32.533 --> 05:34.234
* Same old story... *

05:34.267 --> 05:37.838
Sharing them
should get easier, right?

05:37.871 --> 05:40.541
I hope so.

05:40.574 --> 05:44.545
* I was ordered to listen,
now there's a way *

05:44.578 --> 05:49.417
* And I know that I have
to go away *

05:49.450 --> 05:51.652
* I know... *

05:51.685 --> 05:53.387
Big day.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.089
Me and my eldest
out on the open road.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.225
Coming to complete stops,
keeping it ten and two,

05:58.258 --> 06:00.160
and she'll be trapped

06:00.193 --> 06:02.195
next to her father
for at least an hour,

06:02.229 --> 06:04.398
which means she will be forced
to connect with me.

06:04.432 --> 06:07.034
Very sneaky.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.603
-I approve.
-(exhales)

06:09.637 --> 06:10.771
I knew that you would.

06:12.973 --> 06:16.376
* It's not time
to make a change *

06:16.410 --> 06:18.546
* Just sit down,
take it slowly... *

06:18.579 --> 06:20.280
You ready?

06:20.313 --> 06:21.582
* You're still young... *

06:21.615 --> 06:23.183
All right.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.453
-KATE: Let's eat.
-KEVIN: Look at this.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.888
-Making progress over here.
-I know.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.790
Good for you. That's amazing.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.425
-Thank you.
-You know what's really
exciting news?

06:31.459 --> 06:33.594
Is Franny ate carrots
last night.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.363
I found that out because Madison
sent me a carrot emoji,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.065
not because I was actually
there to witness it in person.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.901
I know it's tough
not living with them,

06:40.934 --> 06:42.302
but I'm really grateful
that you're here.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.204
Honestly, I do not know
how I would be surviving

06:44.237 --> 06:46.306
without all your help.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.375
And maybe it's good
for you, too, right?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.944
Keep you busy between
seeing the kids and work?

06:50.978 --> 06:53.080
Yeah, yeah, no, it's good.
I'm-I'm good, though, I'm fine.

06:53.113 --> 06:53.981
I'm-- You don't have
to worry about me.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.783
I'm going to my meetings, I'm...

06:55.816 --> 06:57.585
You know, I'm thinking about
picking up a hobby, actually.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.087
-Oh.
-Yeah, it was guitar

07:00.120 --> 07:01.889
-or needlepoint.
I can't figure out which...
-(door opens)

07:01.922 --> 07:03.457
TOBY:
Lucys, I'm home.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.958
-(gasps)
-(door closes)

07:04.992 --> 07:07.628
-Is that Daddy?
-Hi.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.497
-Where are my munchkins?
I need munchkin kisses.
-Hi.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.499
-Mwah, mwah, mwah.
-Hi.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.266
And some for you.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.969
Mwah, mwah, mwah.
And some for you.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.971
Mwah, mwah, mwah. Uhp.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.007
-No. Come on.
-Nah, I'm good.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.809
Can we be brothers-in-law
who kiss?

07:21.842 --> 07:23.276
-I...
-Kate, don't get jealous.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.645
-Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
-This is happening.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.979
-Mwah, mwah, mwah.
-Okay.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.347
All right, thank you--
That's a lot of beard.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.119
Oh, gosh, you guys,
36 blissful hours

07:32.152 --> 07:34.655
until I have to listen to
the Southwest flight attendants

07:34.688 --> 07:37.658
turn the safety protocol
into a parody song again.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.192
Wait, you love that.
That was, like,

07:39.226 --> 07:40.127
your favorite part
of the whole trip.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.630
I know. I've gone dead inside.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.198
Well, uh, let me help.
Let me help.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.800
I'll run to the store,
I'll grab something special,

07:46.834 --> 07:48.802
uh, I'll come home, I'll cook
it up, we'll have dinner.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.471
Oh, actually, Kev, um,
Toby and I have plans tonight.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.941
And we already have a sitter,
so the kids are covered.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.676
We're going a recital
at my school.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.478
Yeah, they're doing selections
from The Lion King.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.314
You know, if they do
"He Lives in You,"

08:01.348 --> 08:02.550
I'm gonna lose it.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.817
-(whispers): I'm gonna lose it.
-Mm.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.153
Oh, also,
we're going to Menchie's.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.154
-Oh, you're going to Menchie's?
-Yeah.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.122
Ah, you guys really know
how to party.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.891
Uh, actually, we do.
We're gonna tornado

08:10.924 --> 08:12.459
all the nonfat
frozen yogurt flavors.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.962
Okay, well, you go do that.
Don't worry about me.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.463
-I've got to go to rehearsal.
-(gasps)

08:16.496 --> 08:17.965
Manny say what?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.700
The reboot? How's it going?

08:19.733 --> 08:24.137
It's a good distraction while
Madison and I sort of adjust.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.707
Plus, I don't have to rip
my shirt off at every act break.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.576
Which is why I'm gonna steal
some of Jack's French toast.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.310
Thank you very much, Jack.
All right.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.746
-Bye, guys.
-Okay, now, here's the question.

08:32.780 --> 08:36.149
How many kisses can I get in
in 36 hours?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.985
'Cause I think I can
break the record.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.987
Should I start with your hand?
Ready?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.990
One, two, three, four,
five, six, a million.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.725
-KATE: So many kisses.
-Yeah, that's pretty fast,
right?

08:44.758 --> 08:47.027
Should I give you some on
your hand? Mwah, mwah, mwah...

08:50.798 --> 08:52.099
-Dad!
-Guys, guys, hey, look,
I know we're all excited--

08:52.132 --> 08:53.400
Come here, Kev, come on--
I know we're all excited,

08:53.433 --> 08:55.102
but we're just gonna have
to wait our turn.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.770
But what if they run
out of candy?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.271
They're not gonna
run out of candy, bud.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.674
So, hey, look, let's just,
let's get some snacks

09:00.708 --> 09:02.109
and then we'll go
find our seats.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.410
-Hi.
-Hey, can I help you?

09:03.443 --> 09:06.413
Yeah, can I get, um,
three little popcorns,

09:06.446 --> 09:09.950
some, uh, ooh, some Raisinets--
three of those.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.952
And, uh, do you have coffee?

09:11.985 --> 09:13.420
Sure do.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.122
-Great, it's been a long week.
-KATE: Daddy?

09:15.155 --> 09:17.858
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna live
at work forever?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.761
Uh, I don't live at work,
Katie girl.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.630
I live with you guys, remember?

09:22.663 --> 09:25.298
My dad worked a lot.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.401
I resented it at first,
but look at me now.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.806
Mm. How much are those?

09:32.840 --> 09:34.074
-CLERK: Eight dollars.
-Eight bucks. Great.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.909
Eight bucks, okay,
there's eight.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.911
Got the coffee, got the
popcorns-- Here we go, let's go,

09:37.945 --> 09:39.379
let's go, come on, come on,
come on, we eat that inside,

09:39.412 --> 09:40.447
we're gonna eat that inside.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.986
SANDY:
All right,
should we rehearse one?

09:46.019 --> 09:48.622
All right, now, on the day,
we'll have the real twins here--

09:48.656 --> 09:51.959
Lord help us-- but for now
we'll just use the jelly babies.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.261
-Oh...
-Kevin, were those babies this
creepy when you were the Manny?

09:54.294 --> 09:57.230
(chuckles)
Well, um,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.099
you know, their eyes
were somehow even deader

09:59.132 --> 10:01.068
and they always smelled
like roast beef, so yeah.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.637
-(laughs)
-SANDY: Okay, gang,
um, why don't we

10:03.671 --> 10:04.772
pick it up from the toast?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.506
Taking it from the toast.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.975
Um, okay, that's me.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.844
-"Today was a good day."
-And action.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.312
-Thank you.
-Yes.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.814
Today was a good day.

10:13.847 --> 10:17.317
Um, I'm lucky to have
all of you in my life.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.353
My beautiful wife,
my amazing stepdaughter.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.589
-Can I get my nose pierced?
-Not a chance.

10:22.622 --> 10:28.261
My cute little babies
who are the twinkle in my eye.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.396
And you.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.267
Gang, it's-it's moments
like this, right?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.603
Just being together,
enjoying each other.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.838
Nothing else matters.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.674
You're my world. My life.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.810
You make me whole.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.982
(Sandy clears throat)

10:49.016 --> 10:52.285
Sorry. Yeah, um...
Sorry about that.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.354
"With you, I feel like
I can do anything."

10:54.387 --> 10:57.224
And then I say,
"Drink up, little man."

10:57.257 --> 10:59.359
And hopefully baby Archie
will cheers,

10:59.392 --> 11:01.561
knocking over his milk,
cuing the Manny to say...

11:01.594 --> 11:03.797
I got that.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.498
(grunts)

11:05.532 --> 11:07.634
That's why I always bring
an extra muscle tee to work.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.037
You never know with this guy.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.705
SANDY:
Laugh, laugh, laugh,

11:11.739 --> 11:13.306
and cut. Great.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.641
Let's move over
to the living room

11:14.674 --> 11:16.643
and we'll rehearse scene 12.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.079
(Tyler exhales)

11:19.112 --> 11:21.849
I think that's gonna be
a really nice moment.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.651
Oh. Uh, well, th--
Yeah, thanks. Hope so.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.953
Hope so.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.355
You okay?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.323
Yeah, it's-- You know,
I just, I feel weird

11:30.357 --> 11:31.892
saying all that stuff
to these dolls, you know?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.660
I-I...

11:33.693 --> 11:36.429
I didn't get to spent any time
with my kids today.

11:36.463 --> 11:40.700
Hey, um, some of us
are going out after rehearsal.

11:40.734 --> 11:41.969
You should come.

11:47.975 --> 11:53.046
Okay, there's four sides:
one, two, three.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.182
-Good job.
-Okay, it's gift time.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.951
(whispers):
Babe, I just put Hailey down.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.789
(whispers):
Okay, it's gift time.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.223
(chuckles)

12:03.256 --> 12:04.557
You want to see what I got
for little Jack?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.593
-Yeah.
-Okay, check this out.

12:06.626 --> 12:09.763
It is a beeping football.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.698
-You turn it on,
and it makes a sound.
-(beeping)

12:11.731 --> 12:13.600
We can roll it back and forth
to each other

12:13.633 --> 12:15.135
and get our Eli Manning on.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.205
I picked Eli because he's
the cutest Manning, obviously.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.774
Listen, this is gonna
wind him up,

12:20.808 --> 12:22.409
and he has to go down
for his nap before 3:00,

12:22.442 --> 12:24.477
especially if a sitter's
coming tonight.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.113
But you can play, you know,
when he gets up, okay?

12:26.146 --> 12:29.549
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And you really don't
have to come

12:29.582 --> 12:33.620
-bearing gifts every time.
-Okay, all right.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.756
I guess, uh, I guess you don't
want your present, then?

12:36.790 --> 12:39.259
-Oh, no, I want my present.
-Oh, you--

12:39.292 --> 12:40.961
-Oh, you do. Okay, okay.
-I do. I didn't know
I was getting one.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.163
Um, I know how
you're always so annoyed

12:43.196 --> 12:44.764
about losing the remote control.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.234
So I picked this up in Chinatown

12:47.267 --> 12:48.836
so you'll always know
where it is.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.905
Oh. That's sweet.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.808
It's beautiful. Thank you.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.143
And I've always wanted.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.946
(laughs)
Open it.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.113
Okay.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.616
Babe.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.418
(laughs):
What?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.821
Oh...

13:07.855 --> 13:09.823
-Um...
-Open the purse.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.592
The purse is for you
to carry tonight.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.162
And the gift card is for you
to get your hair blown up.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.964
-(laughs) Blown...
-Blown-blown down.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.166
(chuckles)
Uh, blown out.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.835
While I watch the kids.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.171
My Zoom call got canceled,
so you go do you.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.839
Go get your hair done.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.307
Go get
your hair done.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.876
-KATE: Okay.
-TOBY: Yeah, listen to the man.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.112
-JACK: Okay.
-Okay, I'll see you boys soon.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.981
-Thanks, babe.
-TOBY: Oh, you got it.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.449
-You got it.
-TOBY: Yeah.
Say, "Bye-bye, Mama."

13:36.483 --> 13:37.851
Bye-bye, Mama.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.187
KATE:
Bye, Sweet Pea.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.322
Oh, babe, do you need me
to go over the schedules?

13:42.355 --> 13:43.656
'Cause they change constantly.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.025
And he has to be down
for his nap by 3:00.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.727
Kate, they're my kids, too.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.696
All right? And I think,
if you'll recall,

13:49.729 --> 13:51.464
I was a pretty good
stay-at-home dad myself there

13:51.498 --> 13:52.699
for a while.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.001
So I think I can watch them
for an hour.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.736
Okay.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.638
Thanks, babe.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.806
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.008
-Thank you.
-Say, "I love you, Mama."

14:01.041 --> 14:02.976
-KATE: Bye, boys.
-JACK: Love you.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.411
RANDALL:
Okay, Deja.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.414
Welcome to the Randall Pearson
School of Driving.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.416
I'll be your instructor
Randall Pearson.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.218
Allow me to put on
some background music

14:11.251 --> 14:12.752
as I talk you through
some of the safety features

14:12.785 --> 14:13.820
of the vehicle.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.889
Okay, I can't do this

14:15.923 --> 14:17.357
if we're gonna listen
to your old man music.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.559
Oh! "Old man music"?

14:19.592 --> 14:21.761
That... that's hurtful.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.764
-Mm-hmm. To my ears.
-(laughs)

14:24.797 --> 14:26.099
("Standing at Your Doorstep"
by Alicia Walter playing)

14:26.133 --> 14:27.901
It's good speed.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.169
Make sure you keep that distance

14:29.202 --> 14:30.370
between you and the car
in front of you.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.773
-Got it. Thanks.
-You're doing great, Dej.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.076
* But, baby, it's true... *

14:36.109 --> 14:38.278
Glad we finally found time
to do this.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.514
Haven't had a lot of time
to talk lately.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.383
So, how's school going?

14:43.416 --> 14:45.385
Uh, fine.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.720
-You know Ms. McNamara?
-Your chemistry teacher?

14:47.754 --> 14:49.122
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.757
Well, she's getting
into stand-up comedy.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.960
(laughs):
Okay.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.529
And she tries out
her jokes on us.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.598
-But, like, bad ones.
-Mm-hmm.

14:58.631 --> 15:03.270
Um, like, "Why can you never
trust atoms?"

15:03.303 --> 15:05.905
Because they make up everything.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.942
(laughs)

15:08.976 --> 15:11.444
You are worse than Ms. McNamara.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.380
Oh, man.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.648
All right, look,
we're about to merge.

15:15.682 --> 15:19.819
-So, uh, put on your signal...
-(both chuckle)

15:19.852 --> 15:21.788
...and check your mirrors.

15:21.821 --> 15:25.592
And when you feel like
you got space, go for it.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.827
-(phone chimes)
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Message
from Malik.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.997
RANDALL:
Watch the merge, Deja.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.332
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Can't stop thinking
about last weekend.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.434
-Wish you were here now.
-Oh...

15:34.467 --> 15:35.802
-Hands on the wheel, Deja.
-(phone chimes)

15:35.835 --> 15:37.404
Can't really sleep.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.107
The bed feels
too big without you.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.975
Ready to reply?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.688
She took a six-hour bus ride
four states away,

15:55.722 --> 15:57.424
and we had no idea.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.658
-What if something happened?
-Let's kill her.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.293
Let's dig a hole in the backyard
and bury her in it.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.663
And it's not just how dangerous
it could have been, Beth.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.698
It's the lying.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.335
And it wasn't just one lie,
she lied right to our faces.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.170
Right to our faces.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.372
Okay, hold up.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.673
I feel like we need to pick

16:13.706 --> 16:15.375
which one of us
is gonna unravel here

16:15.408 --> 16:16.509
and which one of us
is gonna stay cool.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.845
I'm already pacing, Beth.
I'm up.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.713
Okay, fine, I'll stay cool.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.682
She is grounded.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.983
Phone, gone.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.685
Food, maybe.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.055
And she is forbidden
from seeing Malik for forever.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.456
Can we put her back
on Zoom school?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.890
I feel like that's kind of
punishing ourselves,

16:30.923 --> 16:32.959
-so I want to hold off...
-We need to make an example

16:32.992 --> 16:34.727
of her Tess and for Annie.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.330
Maybe we should ground them all
just to get ahead of it.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.900
Randall, you're so hot,
I'm gonna need an ice bath.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.735
So why don't I go talk to her?

16:42.769 --> 16:45.338
Why, Beth?
So she can lie some more?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.307
Huh? Huh-- You know what?
I'm too hot.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.975
I'm too hot ri--
I-I'm-a go for a run.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.677
-That's what I'm-a...
-That's a good plan.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.049
HENRI:
I know, my little immigrant.

16:56.083 --> 16:59.319
You want to find your family.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.255
-And you will.
-FIEVEL: But how?

17:02.289 --> 17:05.992
It's so far away
and it's so big.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.528
I'll never find them anyway.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.331
-Where are you going?
-This movie's dumb.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.401
HENRI:
But did you say "never"?

17:14.434 --> 17:17.104
So young and you have lost hope

17:17.137 --> 17:19.106
Oh, this is America.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.007
You can just keep it open.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.843
I swear, this is not
why I invited you.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.845
But if Dad's buying,
let's order shots.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.081
-You guys want some shots?
-Heck, yeah.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.283
Uh, can we get six shots
of tequila?

17:30.317 --> 17:32.018
Thank you. To Kevin.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.020
-Cheers.
-ALL: Kevin.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.788
Oh, thank you.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.293
It's so impressive

17:40.327 --> 17:42.395
how you can be around people
and not drink.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.531
Oh, uh, you know, I-I...

17:44.564 --> 17:48.301
I'm better off without it,
trust me. It's...

17:48.335 --> 17:49.702
Should you be drinking,
though, honestly?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.138
I mean, aren't you,
like, 17 years old?

17:51.171 --> 17:54.107
-I'm 25. I just look young.
-Okay.

17:54.141 --> 17:57.110
-(laughs)
-Well. That's great.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.212
I was thinking that,
maybe after this,

17:59.246 --> 18:00.880
we could go check out
White Sea at The Echo.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.282
Do you know her?

18:02.315 --> 18:05.818
She used to be
the keyboardist for M83.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.554
I-- no-- I don't think
I do know her.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.256
I'm not sure

18:09.289 --> 18:11.424
anything that you just said
was English, actually.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.661
Give me your phone.
I'll show you a clip.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.496
Here you go.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.466
Oh. Oh.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.468
Um...

18:21.501 --> 18:23.503
(tongue clicks, exhales)

18:23.536 --> 18:24.804
(phone chimes)

18:24.837 --> 18:27.607
Excu-- Uh, excuse me.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.976
Hey, Kevin, look at this.

18:30.009 --> 18:34.914
One, two, one, two.
(gasps)

18:34.947 --> 18:37.817
-Franny, walk to Mama.
Walk to Mama.
-(exhales)

18:37.850 --> 18:41.154
Come here. Yes! Ooh...

18:41.188 --> 18:43.423
(laughs):
Oh, this is...

18:43.456 --> 18:46.593
(stammers) You know, I can't--
uh, I-I got to go.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.628
I'll be ba-- I'm not, I'm
probably not gonna come back.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.431
-What?
-I-- Just-just keep it open.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.333
Okay, so usually
he's in his jammies by now,

18:53.366 --> 18:55.868
but, uh, he's a little
off-schedule today, so...

18:55.902 --> 18:58.438
That's okay. We can get you
into your jammies, right, Jack?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.006
-Hey.
-KATE: Hi.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.541
How old is McKenna?

19:01.574 --> 19:02.975
Looks like she just turned 12.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.712
Um, 17-ish?

19:05.745 --> 19:08.515
She's been really great
this past month, and she is,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.049
honestly, amazing.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.351
Thank you.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.320
Although the kids
are usually asleep.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.721
No!

19:14.754 --> 19:16.389
Sorry, he's cranky.
He didn't have his nap.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.825
'Cause his dad bought him
a new toy and...

19:18.858 --> 19:20.393
Uh, which he loves.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.994
It's a football that beeps.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.796
-And he loves it.
-KATE: Yeah,

19:23.830 --> 19:25.164
and he had to play
with it, right,

19:25.198 --> 19:27.534
-'cause it started
beeping and...
-No!

19:27.567 --> 19:29.702
-Okay. I'll get it. I'll get it.
-Oh, uh, sorry.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.971
-No.
-I'll get it.
I got it, I got it.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.540
KATE:
Great, well, now
I'm gonna be worried

19:33.573 --> 19:35.308
about him when
we're at the recital.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.577
Kate, you just need,
you need to relax. Okay?

19:37.610 --> 19:39.145
Really? What you needed to do

19:39.178 --> 19:40.513
was put him to bed at 3:00
like I asked you to.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.316
(chuckles): I-I'm sure
we-we're gonna be fine.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.984
I'm sure that
we're gonna be late.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.919
You know what? Here,
why don't you just go ahead--

19:46.953 --> 19:49.689
here's that and here's this--

19:49.722 --> 19:52.058
and I'll just stay here and make
sure that Jack goes down, okay?

19:52.091 --> 19:53.426
Oh, thank God.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.528
I'm gonna grab my bag.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.430
All right.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.401
KATE:
So, I'll just go alone?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.503
Kate, I know you worked hard
on this. You should be there.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.872
I'll just, I'll-I'll catch
the next one, I guess.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.341
You want some chicken?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.209
-Yes.
-Yeah, okay, here you go.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.779
There you go.
See? We're doing great.

20:12.812 --> 20:16.082
-(clears throat)
-Okay.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.422
-WARREN: How'd you get in here?
-(crunch)

20:22.455 --> 20:23.956
-(Warren howls)
-(laughter)

20:23.990 --> 20:26.459
(chuckles)

20:26.493 --> 20:28.561
Get me that mouse!

20:28.595 --> 20:30.062
Where's your brother?

20:30.096 --> 20:32.565
-He left.
-What do you mean,
he left? When?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.934
Get your coats.
Come on, let's go.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.370
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.971
*

20:42.275 --> 20:45.244
Come here, come here. Kevin?

20:45.278 --> 20:47.280
Hey, excuse me, hey.
Have you, have you seen

20:47.314 --> 20:49.649
a little blond boy a-about the
same height as the two of them?

20:49.682 --> 20:52.585
I think I saw him go out
in the mall about an hour ago,

20:52.619 --> 20:56.122
-but I'm also incredibly stoned.
-Go, go.

20:56.155 --> 20:59.025
-So, yeah.
-Come on, come on. Come on.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.028
(laughs softly)

21:04.497 --> 21:06.466
Hey. Hey.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.000
Hi.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.338
Hi. What happened?

21:12.972 --> 21:15.408
He went to the food court
looking for free samples

21:15.442 --> 21:17.344
and got a little turned around

21:17.377 --> 21:20.780
and they found him crying
outside of Spencer Gifts.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.682
-Mm-mm.
-(exhales, stammers)

21:22.715 --> 21:25.652
I-I don't understand.
How did they know who to call?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.859
You got to be kidding me.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.126
You guys want to go home?

21:34.160 --> 21:35.762
-Mm-hmm.
-All right, let's do it.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.631
-How was the movie?
-RANDALL: Half of it was good.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.600
KATE:
Yeah, 'cause we only watched
half of it.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.134
Thank you.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.372
Have a good night.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.674
(gasps)
Ellie, that was amazing.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.609
We should have
always used you on alto.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.878
-Thanks, Miss Kate.
-You're welcome. Good night.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.780
-Good night.
-Kate. Kate.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.383
Huh? I'd have to say,

21:56.416 --> 21:58.985
that was one of the most
successful recitals ever.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.220
-Aw.
-(chuckles) But in-in fairness,

22:01.253 --> 22:03.556
parents rarely boo
their blind children.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.024
Eh...

22:07.360 --> 22:09.729
I, uh, I thought I was
finally gonna meet

22:09.762 --> 22:11.531
the, uh, the famous Toby.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.232
Uh, yeah, he had
to stay home with the kids.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.301
Ugh. Kids are the worst.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.470
That's why I try to never be
around them ever.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.971
Good job, Alyssa. Well done.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.374
-Thank you.
-Okay. Night night.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.875
You know,
it's not the kids' fault.

22:22.909 --> 22:26.813
It's really not anyone's fault,
um, but...

22:26.846 --> 22:28.981
-You probably don't want
to hear about it, so...
-Not really.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.551
It's just that we had
this stupid argument,

22:31.584 --> 22:33.553
you know, about the kids'
schedules, and it just sucks

22:33.586 --> 22:34.887
because he's only here
for the weekend.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.690
(exhales)
It's not a big deal.

22:37.724 --> 22:41.060
And I certainly should not be
talking about it at work.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.697
My wife and I had a stupid fight
that went on for years.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.733
Uh, bath towels.

22:46.766 --> 22:50.603
She would never hang them up.
It made me crazy.

22:50.637 --> 22:54.073
And every day I'd go to work
and I'd start my class

22:54.106 --> 22:57.109
by announcing whether or not
she hung up her towel.

22:57.143 --> 23:00.580
And then, one day, I just, um,

23:00.613 --> 23:04.751
I stopped giving the report,
because it became pretty obvious

23:04.784 --> 23:10.590
that we had problems that were
much bigger than bath towels.

23:10.623 --> 23:14.393
It-it wasn't really an anecdote
I wanted to share anymore.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.896
So, as annoying as it is

23:16.929 --> 23:19.131
that you told me about your
stupid fight with your husband,

23:19.165 --> 23:22.969
just, uh, take it
as a good sign

23:23.002 --> 23:24.737
that you're still talking
about it.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.073
All right, I got to lock up.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.610
*

23:37.984 --> 23:40.019
(door opens)

24:03.843 --> 24:05.878
*

24:15.488 --> 24:17.624
Where is she? Where's our
little Allyson Felix?

24:17.657 --> 24:19.025
You know what I was gonna do,
I was gonna stop by,

24:19.058 --> 24:20.426
I was gonna get some running
shoes before I came over here.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.828
I thought that'd be kind
of funny, but then I got

24:21.861 --> 24:23.329
so excited, I thought,
"No, just go on by

24:23.362 --> 24:24.997
and see where she is."
You blink, you miss her.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.298
Where'd she go? Where is she?

24:26.332 --> 24:27.834
What are you,
what are you doing here?

24:27.867 --> 24:30.302
I came to see Franny walk.

24:30.336 --> 24:34.040
It's 7:30. She's asleep.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.842
Okay, but y-- I mean,
you couldn't have kept her up

24:35.875 --> 24:37.644
for, like, another 20 minutes?

24:37.677 --> 24:39.979
Kevin, come on, I can't change
their sleep schedule

24:40.012 --> 24:42.314
-every time they do something.
-Someth-- This isn't something.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.350
She, she propelled her body

24:44.383 --> 24:45.852
in a forward motion
in an upright manner.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.887
This is not something.
This is a major milestone.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.822
This is huge.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.391
There will be
a million major milestones.

24:52.424 --> 24:54.093
We're not gonna be there
for every one of them.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.065
You mean I'm not gonna be
there for every one of them.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.733
Kevin.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.802
Madison, I took this stupid job
so that I could be close

25:02.835 --> 25:04.070
to my kids so I could
see 'em all the time.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.872
It turns out, I can't.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.340
What are you talking about?
You were here this morning.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.009
You're gonna be back here again
tomorrow morning.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.978
She will live
to walk another day.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.212
Yeah, and it won't be the same.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.914
It won't be the--
You know, this sucks.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.383
You know, it's like you get
all of the firsts, right?

25:17.416 --> 25:19.986
And then I'm supposed to, what,
uh, just cling desperately

25:20.019 --> 25:22.021
to my phone, j-just hoping
for a text from you.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.356
I immediately sent you a text.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.725
You sent me a video, well,
thank you very much,

25:25.758 --> 25:27.259
I feel so connected
to my children.

25:27.293 --> 25:31.097
Look, I am sorry
that you are feeling feelings

25:31.130 --> 25:32.498
or whatever you're doing
right now,

25:32.531 --> 25:34.400
but this is not
a picnic for me, okay?

25:34.433 --> 25:37.403
Yes, Franny walked today,
and it was adorable,

25:37.436 --> 25:40.940
and I am genuinely sorry
that you missed that.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.709
But an hour before that,
Nick barfed all over me

25:42.742 --> 25:43.943
while I was trying to wolf down

25:43.976 --> 25:45.344
a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich,

25:45.377 --> 25:47.513
and now I have to somehow
clean it out of my hair

25:47.546 --> 25:49.916
before Elijah comes over so
that I don't seem revolting

25:49.949 --> 25:52.919
and end up alone forever.

25:52.952 --> 25:56.889
Clean the baby vomit out of
my hair, not the peanut butter.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.991
Although I think I also have
peanut butter in my hair.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.731
(exhales)

26:06.899 --> 26:11.237
I... I know how badly
you want to be in their lives.

26:11.270 --> 26:15.341
And you will be,
but we're not together.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.911
And so that means that sometimes

26:18.945 --> 26:21.280
one of us is gonna feel
left out.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.292
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
you're right.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.465
Can you do me a favor,
when she wakes up,

26:39.498 --> 26:41.968
will you tell her that her dad
came by?

26:44.503 --> 26:45.805
Tell her that I'm proud of her?

26:45.838 --> 26:47.874
Okay.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.477
Okay.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.985
*

27:04.691 --> 27:07.860
All is well. Kevin is happily
playing with his Legos,

27:07.894 --> 27:11.297
not a care in the world.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.999
You wrote our phone number
inside his shoe.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.135
Thank God they have you.

27:16.168 --> 27:21.040
Okay, it's time
to forgive yourself. He's fine.

27:21.073 --> 27:25.511
I just, I wanted them
to have a great day.

27:25.544 --> 27:28.180
You know?
Our kids are old enough

27:28.214 --> 27:30.049
to start making memories now,
Bec.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.784
Like, important stuff,

27:31.818 --> 27:33.019
real stuff
they're gonna remember

27:33.052 --> 27:35.487
-for the rest of their lives.
-Mm-hmm.

27:35.521 --> 27:40.727
And now, every time Kevin thinks
about that first movie he saw,

27:40.760 --> 27:43.996
he's just gonna think about
a day he was traumatized.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.667
Okay.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.503
Let me tell you about
our trip to the park yesterday.

27:51.537 --> 27:53.239
All the kids wanted to do

27:53.272 --> 27:55.541
was ride the rocket slide,
but it was closed.

27:55.574 --> 27:59.011
And Kate had to pee,
but there was no bathroom,

27:59.045 --> 28:00.412
and Kevin and Randall

28:00.446 --> 28:02.314
were fighting over
the last Capri Sun.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.515
It was a mess.

28:03.549 --> 28:04.751
We got to the car

28:04.784 --> 28:07.019
and everybody was crying,
myself included.

28:07.053 --> 28:12.524
And just when I thought
it was the worst day ever, um,

28:12.558 --> 28:15.427
a ladybug landed
on the dashboard.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.663
-(laughs softly)
-And Kevin tells us

28:17.696 --> 28:19.732
it's good luck.

28:19.766 --> 28:23.169
And Randall says that ladybugs
have two sets of wings.

28:23.202 --> 28:27.940
And Kate decided to name it.

28:27.974 --> 28:30.409
-Linda.
-Linda the Ladybug.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.245
So, when I was
tucking them in last night,

28:33.279 --> 28:36.215
that's what they remember
from the day.

28:36.248 --> 28:41.053
Not the crying, not the Capri
Suns, but Linda the Ladybug.

28:42.789 --> 28:45.591
Until a day is over,
there's always a chance

28:45.624 --> 28:47.894
you'll remember it
for something else.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.807
(door opens)

29:00.840 --> 29:04.443
(exhales)

29:04.476 --> 29:06.378
All right, Beth.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.413
-Here's what we're gonna do.
-We're not gonna be able

29:07.446 --> 29:10.149
to ground this
out of her, Randall.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.717
That girl is completely in love.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.419
Doesn't give her an excuse.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.721
It's like how you and I felt
at the beginning.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.824
If somebody would have told us
we couldn't see each other

29:17.857 --> 29:18.991
for months,
we would have found a way.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.259
So what are you saying, Beth?

29:20.292 --> 29:21.727
That, because she's in love,

29:21.760 --> 29:22.795
there shouldn't be
any consequences?

29:22.829 --> 29:24.496
Oh, no, there's gonna
be consequences.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.998
Like, she's not gonna
see this again

29:26.032 --> 29:27.299
until they come out
with the iPhone 30.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.468
-Okay.
-But...

29:29.501 --> 29:32.839
this isn't just about
what happened last weekend.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.474
This is...

29:35.507 --> 29:37.609
We thought our daughter
was a child,

29:37.643 --> 29:40.079
playing Candy Land,

29:40.112 --> 29:42.849
but she's out here playing
The Game of Life,

29:42.882 --> 29:44.884
and we have to adjust.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.192
Randall, take a big sip
of my wine.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.460
I don't want a big sip
of your wine.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.562
-I just ran for five miles.
-Drink the wine.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.235
I'm taking Deja
to get birth control.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.187
(whispers):
Hey.

30:21.220 --> 30:25.524
I was trying to sneak in
undetected in case, you know,

30:25.557 --> 30:27.860
"grown-up time"
was still going on.

30:27.894 --> 30:30.696
Which is-is kind of "gross,"
you know, I keep saying "it"

30:30.729 --> 30:33.832
because you're married
to my "sister."

30:33.866 --> 30:37.036
-Why are you doing that?
-I-- You know,
I-I'm so tired, man,

30:37.069 --> 30:39.138
I-I don't even--
I can't, you know...

30:39.171 --> 30:41.240
Well, you don't have
to worry about it,

30:41.273 --> 30:44.310
'cause grown-up time was a bust.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.845
Kate went to the recital
all by herself.

30:46.879 --> 30:50.016
I literally just got both kids
down for the night.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.918
Which, it turns out, is a
nightmare when the nap schedule

30:51.951 --> 30:53.920
-is all out of whack.
-Ooh, yeah,

30:53.953 --> 30:55.521
no, you don't want to mess
with the nap schedule.

30:55.554 --> 30:56.788
So I hear.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.427
What's all this? You, uh,
you taking off tomorrow?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.930
TOBY:
Yep. Bright and early,

31:03.963 --> 31:09.501
so I can make it in time
for the 9:00 a.m. staff meeting.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.869
Yeah, at least you have
an excuse, you know?

31:10.903 --> 31:13.940
I live in the same city
as my kids, I feel like a...

31:13.973 --> 31:16.108
a stranger, so...

31:18.077 --> 31:21.713
You know, when I first found out
I was gonna be a dad,

31:21.747 --> 31:25.584
I kept trying to picture it,
you know, in my head.

31:25.617 --> 31:31.190
And the image that kept popping
into my mind was, uh,

31:31.223 --> 31:33.392
family dinner, dinner table,
you know?

31:33.425 --> 31:35.995
Mom, dad, couple of kids.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.267
This was gonna be us.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.936
Me, Madison, the two kids.

31:43.970 --> 31:47.206
Square, you know?
A solid... unit.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.275
Well, for what it's worth,
that dinner table

31:49.308 --> 31:51.277
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.479
I sat through plenty of dinners
with my parents,

31:53.512 --> 31:55.281
who clearly couldn't
stand each other.

31:55.314 --> 32:00.586
I think kids would much rather
have parents that are happy

32:00.619 --> 32:01.887
than parents who are together.

32:01.920 --> 32:06.858
Yeah, but I'm not happy.

32:09.996 --> 32:15.267
You know, it's funny,
when... when we're kids,

32:15.301 --> 32:20.906
we always, we build houses
that are, uh, square,

32:20.939 --> 32:24.176
because we think...

32:24.210 --> 32:27.346
that that is the strongest shape
that there is.

32:28.847 --> 32:31.483
But, turns out...

32:36.455 --> 32:39.925
...a triangle is the strongest
shape in nature.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.793
Strong base.

32:41.827 --> 32:45.164
It's capable of holding
infinitely more weight...

32:47.499 --> 32:51.737
It is the most stable shape
that there is.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.210
See?

32:59.911 --> 33:01.980
So maybe you should just stop
thinking of your family

33:02.014 --> 33:05.884
as a square and start
thinking of it as, you know,

33:05.917 --> 33:10.489
you, Nick, Franny.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.191
A triangle.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.528
The hell are you talking about
right now, man?

33:16.562 --> 33:19.198
(laughs)

33:19.231 --> 33:22.034
I don't, I don't know.
I have no idea.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.835
I thought I was gonna be having
sex with your sister tonight.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.337
-Oh, come on, man.
-(exhales)

33:30.076 --> 33:32.678
("With You" by Cujo Moon
playing)

33:34.713 --> 33:37.583
* I would go anywhere with you *

33:40.018 --> 33:43.122
* Anywhere I go, it's true *

33:45.224 --> 33:48.227
* High up on the mountains *

33:48.260 --> 33:51.863
* Show me a new point of view *

33:56.868 --> 33:59.538
* Hiding in the skies so blue *

33:59.571 --> 34:02.608
(yelling)

34:02.641 --> 34:06.078
* The skies, they are hiding
the truth... *

34:06.112 --> 34:08.414
-Thank you.
-All right, all right.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.516
* Floating down the river *

34:10.549 --> 34:15.421
* Reflections in the water
with you *

34:18.990 --> 34:22.194
* With you *

34:22.228 --> 34:27.599
* With you, with you *

34:27.633 --> 34:30.802
* With you *

34:30.836 --> 34:32.371
(knocking on door)

34:32.404 --> 34:36.608
* With you, with you... *

34:36.642 --> 34:40.812
Listen, I already apologized
to Beth. Please...

34:40.846 --> 34:44.082
don't make me have
this conversation with you.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.321
You know, today,
when I saw you behind the wheel

34:49.355 --> 34:51.022
of that car, I thought...

34:53.459 --> 34:56.428
"She looks ridiculous.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.497
She's way too young
to be driving."

35:01.133 --> 35:05.003
Because, to me...

35:09.141 --> 35:11.443
...you look exactly
like the little girl

35:11.477 --> 35:14.180
who came to my doorstep
with everything she had

35:14.213 --> 35:17.683
in the world
tucked into one bag.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.688
Now, rationally, of course,

35:22.721 --> 35:26.625
I knew that this little girl had
already grown up quite a bit.

35:26.658 --> 35:31.330
And I knew that the rest of
the growing up was still coming.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.699
I just didn't realize
that it would come so quickly.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.571
And maybe that's why I'm having
a hard time with this.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.644
'Cause I missed the first
12 years of your life,

35:45.677 --> 35:50.015
and I guess now I'm just
trying to stall for time.

35:53.352 --> 35:58.089
To hold on to that very
particular version of my Deja.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.795
So...

36:03.829 --> 36:07.533
if you would be so kind,

36:07.566 --> 36:11.303
please be patient with me

36:11.337 --> 36:15.974
as I wrap my head around
this new,

36:16.007 --> 36:20.379
beautiful, grown-up you.

36:28.086 --> 36:30.589
(clears throat)

36:30.622 --> 36:32.658
Mm-hmm.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.394
That being said,

36:35.427 --> 36:39.265
you are still a junior
in high school,

36:39.298 --> 36:40.932
and you will not be going
to visit your boyfriend

36:40.966 --> 36:44.035
in Boston again anytime soon.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.979
Well, that's going
to be a problem.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.083
*

37:22.674 --> 37:24.743
*

37:35.487 --> 37:37.323
(vibrating)

37:42.761 --> 37:44.596
Why are you calling me
in the middle of the night?

37:44.630 --> 37:48.667
Ha, uh...

37:48.700 --> 37:50.736
Because I'm sleeping
on my sister's couch

37:50.769 --> 37:52.971
even though I have enough money
to buy a big, fancy house,

37:53.004 --> 37:55.907
and because, Cassidy, I...

37:55.941 --> 38:00.779
(exhales) ...was about to call
my 25-year-old costar

38:00.812 --> 38:02.748
who plays my stepdaughter
for a booty call,

38:02.781 --> 38:06.952
and you live across the country
and you were born before Y2K

38:06.985 --> 38:09.755
-and I figured you were
the better option.
-(laughs softly)

38:09.788 --> 38:11.523
You really know how
to flatter a girl.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.191
Hmm.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.136
Hi.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.942
(laughs):
So, I went to Menchie's

38:30.976 --> 38:32.978
and did the whole
tornado yogurt thing myself.

38:33.011 --> 38:35.213
And, yeah, I got some
severe looks from Darcy

38:35.246 --> 38:38.149
behind the counter,
but I don't care.

38:41.487 --> 38:45.991
It is really tough
with-without you here.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.828
I know.

38:54.766 --> 38:58.069
Listen, you-you know our kids
way better than I do right now.

38:58.103 --> 39:02.007
That's just the truth, and I
should be following your lead.

39:05.444 --> 39:08.747
Now, I know I don't need
to buy any more presents,

39:08.780 --> 39:12.518
but I want to get one more
thing, and it's for all of us.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.719
Can I show you?

39:13.752 --> 39:16.087
Okay.

39:16.121 --> 39:19.024
-Let me show you. Okay.
-Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.094
All right.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.497
All right.
(clears throat)

39:25.531 --> 39:27.833
-We already have a grill.
-Au contraire, mon frère.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.402
This is no mere grill.

39:30.436 --> 39:33.939
This is a smoker.
This is the Big Green Egg.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.842
This smoker will outlast time,
global warming,

39:36.875 --> 39:38.109
and all the other awful things
coming our way.

39:38.143 --> 39:40.345
Look, Kate,

39:40.378 --> 39:42.614
I don't want all of our memories
of this time

39:42.648 --> 39:45.116
to be about us being apart.

39:45.150 --> 39:50.221
So let's make some memories
of us being together.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.390
Let's have big old cookouts
and let's eat food

39:52.424 --> 39:55.126
that took me, like,
900 hours to cook.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.029
Let's be smokers.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.699
-Okay. Let's be smokers.
-Okay.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.401
Check this out. Okay. This is,
this is the biggest version.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.871
They make all kinds
of accessories for it.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.806
JACK:
Good things come
to those who wait.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.776
-Mm.
-And we...

40:10.809 --> 40:15.380
are good to go.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.382
You know, you don't need
to keep using that thing.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.718
It's like the literal symbol

40:19.751 --> 40:21.987
of the day your mom and dad's
marriage blew up.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.725
Besides, that day almost
permanently deformed

40:26.758 --> 40:28.994
-that near-perfect face
of yours.
-(laughs)

40:31.262 --> 40:33.999
I keep it because
it's delicious.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.169
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.938
-(laughs)
-Yes.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.973
*

41:04.896 --> 41:07.499
See? That's what today will be.

41:07.533 --> 41:11.002
Not the day he got lost,
but the day that his dad

41:11.036 --> 41:15.006
made sundaes in the kitchen
and put pillows on the ground.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.942
That is how he'll remember it.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.310
That's how we're gonna
remember it.

41:19.344 --> 41:21.880
Never too late
to turn a day around.

41:21.913 --> 41:23.615
You know, I should
always listen to you.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.483
That's what
I've been telling you.

41:31.422 --> 41:32.858
(sighs)

41:34.826 --> 41:36.094
(phone ringing)

41:38.063 --> 41:39.164
Hello.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.501
Yeah, this is.

41:45.671 --> 41:48.273
(stammers)
Wait, what?

41:54.546 --> 41:57.048
No, I...

41:57.082 --> 41:59.017
I understand.

42:02.554 --> 42:06.424
Okay, um...

42:06.457 --> 42:08.059
Yeah. Thank you.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.132
Who was that?

42:19.938 --> 42:21.940
My mom died.
