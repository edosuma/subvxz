00:22.422 --> 00:26.381
Well, I'm just a small town cop.
Mostly I give out parking tickets.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.757
I don't want to talk about your work.

00:28.828 --> 00:31.729
Okay. How are things in LA?

00:32.165 --> 00:33.325
Jesse.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.634
Why'd you call me at the office, Jenn?

00:36.703 --> 00:39.263
I don't want you to call me tonight.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.764
Okay.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.804
Actually, I don't think
we should talk for a while.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.642
- How long a while?
- I don't know.

00:48.648 --> 00:49.808
Okay.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.448
Someone's coming over.

00:53.853 --> 00:57.289
He thinks it's strange
that we still talk every night.

00:58.525 --> 01:01.585
- Was he there last night?
- Yes.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.054
Okay.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.890
You understand?

01:09.469 --> 01:11.334
- No.
- You all right?

01:12.572 --> 01:14.631
- Yes.
- Jesse.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.675
Thank you.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.991
Things get this slow when Lou was Chief?

01:39.065 --> 01:40.726
All the time.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.166
- How's your wife?
- Ex-wife, Rose.

01:44.637 --> 01:47.435
- The rabid skunk has been dispatched.
- How?

01:47.507 --> 01:49.441
DeAngelo shot him.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.739
- Okay.
- DeAngelo was not happy.

01:52.645 --> 01:55.170
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Why is it always my fault?"

01:55.248 --> 01:58.979
Hey, I didn't say it was his fault.
I just said I was blaming him for it.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.486
- He thinks you pick on him.
- Well, I don't like him.

02:01.554 --> 02:04.318
Well, if you don't like him,
why don't you fire him?

02:04.390 --> 02:07.848
I'm not going to fire him.
I'm going to wear him down.

02:08.394 --> 02:09.985
Wednesday is your town council meeting.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.691
Oh, I'm going to be late tomorrow.
I have to take Brian to the orthodontist.

02:12.765 --> 02:15.495
And Edwin says the Civil War Memorial
has fallen down.

02:15.568 --> 02:16.865
He's watering too much.

02:16.936 --> 02:18.870
Well, he wants the Square to look good
for the fall regatta.

02:18.938 --> 02:20.303
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.773
- What did he say?
- He wants to know how you know.

02:22.842 --> 02:25.572
I'm the Police Chief. I know everything.

02:26.613 --> 02:30.379
- He thinks it might be vandalism.
- Tell him he's watering too much.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.251
No, you do it.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.253
- Get your bike, honey.
- I'll get it.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.203
Brahms?

02:58.578 --> 03:01.911
- Excuse me.
- I'm Hilda Evans, Chief Stone.

03:03.082 --> 03:05.414
How's the drinking thing going?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.418
Small town.

03:07.487 --> 03:11.947
Ever since people heard you were drunk
on your job interview, there's been concern.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.220
Actually, I drank too much the night before.

03:14.294 --> 03:18.162
I just made the mistake of having one
in the morning to steady up.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.721
Brahms.

03:19.799 --> 03:23.132
When I'm feeling troubled,
I sit in my favorite chair,

03:23.203 --> 03:26.070
put my head back and listen to Brahms.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.898
I find it comforting.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.709
Enough said.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.991
Wake up.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.026
I know you can hear me.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.934
Doctor says your wound is
completely healed.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.308
"Believe it or not. Melbourne, Australia.

04:05.378 --> 04:08.814
"A man left comatose for over 10 years,
suddenly sat bolt upright,

04:08.881 --> 04:11.406
"and said, 'I'll have a cappuccino."'

04:19.659 --> 04:21.853
Boy, everything happens at once, Suitcase.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.329
Things are really jumping in Paradise.
Rampant crime.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.165
I just heard at the weekly briefing

04:28.234 --> 04:31.260
that there's a drug ring
trying to set up in our town.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.033
I could use a little back-up.

04:36.476 --> 04:41.243
Suit, we're a four-people police force.
With Molly out, I got to retrain Rose.

04:45.518 --> 04:48.351
The town council wants me to replace you.

05:02.969 --> 05:07.269
"It was bitter cold, the wind in his face
made it difficult to grasp

05:07.340 --> 05:08.864
"the shape before him.

05:08.941 --> 05:13.071
"The bow of the yacht cut through the sea,
neatly cleaving the water

05:13.146 --> 05:15.706
"into mirror image waves.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.250
"Now he saw the ship in its full glory.

05:18.318 --> 05:23.654
"Eighty feet at least, mahogany hull,
in full sail, dark and silent.

05:23.723 --> 05:26.123
"A latter day Flying Dutchman:"

08:16.496 --> 08:17.724
Nice car.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.192
Are you giving me a ticket?

08:21.901 --> 08:24.062
- That depends.
- On what?

08:24.136 --> 08:27.299
- Lf this is your car.
- You don't think I can own a car like this?

08:27.373 --> 08:29.898
- I didn't say that.
- It's not mine.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.467
Then I'm not giving you a ticket.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.707
Look, the owner's just been in a week.
He came up for...

08:35.780 --> 08:37.772
- Race Week.
...Race Week.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.808
Race Week's good for local business, right?

08:40.886 --> 08:43.947
- It is.
- Well, then, why give him a ticket?

08:44.023 --> 08:45.615
The curb is red.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.022
What if it were my car?

08:48.094 --> 08:50.790
I'd still give it a ticket,
but with infinitely more regret.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.766
- So are you feeling regret?
- A little.

08:54.834 --> 08:58.463
Well, I know how to fix that. Tear it up.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.396
No.

09:00.806 --> 09:03.172
You want to get me in trouble, don't you?

09:03.242 --> 09:04.573
No.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.545
- And you are feeling regret?
- Yes.

09:16.289 --> 09:21.283
Don't you have anything better to do than
spend your time writing parking tickets?

09:22.194 --> 09:23.218
No.

09:51.424 --> 09:57.021
Hi, Jesse: It's Jenn: I guess you already left:
I'll call you at the office:

12:23.342 --> 12:24.331
Hello?

12:24.777 --> 12:26.005
It's me.

12:26.779 --> 12:27.803
What's wrong?

12:29.982 --> 12:32.348
Nothing. I just wanted to see
how you were doing, Molly.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.146
Fine. You?

12:37.156 --> 12:39.454
- I woke you up.
- No, no, you didn't:

12:39.825 --> 12:43.022
- I'm too uncomfortable to sleep.
- What time is it?

12:47.166 --> 12:49.225
9:00 in LA.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.394
How is Jenn?

12:52.972 --> 12:54.064
Fine.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.801
- You okay?
- Yes:

12:57.877 --> 12:59.367
Would you tell me if you weren't?

13:00.045 --> 13:01.171
No.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.875
There's a lot of people
who care about you, Jesse:

13:03.949 --> 13:05.143
Including you?

13:05.818 --> 13:07.149
Especially me.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.519
So you think you're going
to have the kid early?

13:10.589 --> 13:12.147
Hopefully not too early:

13:14.393 --> 13:15.451
How's Rose doing?

13:16.095 --> 13:18.154
She's a little rusty, but she's doing fine.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.423
- Did you see Suitcase today?
- Every day:

13:21.500 --> 13:22.626
Did you give him my love?

13:23.636 --> 13:24.728
I forgot.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.663
Oh, did you have the test?

13:29.208 --> 13:30.800
The baby's fine.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.938
I'm what's termed a "high-risk mother."
Means old.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.346
Jesse, I need to get some sleep.

13:43.422 --> 13:44.548
I woke you up.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.058
Will you call me tomorrow?

13:49.328 --> 13:50.488
Sure.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.656
So, nobody called?

16:05.197 --> 16:06.824
Don't do phones.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.935
- Are you going out?
- In a while.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.439
- Because we're almost out of coffee.
- I think you should get some.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.371
Sorry I'm late.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.483
- Skipper...
- Not today, DeAngelo.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.860
Are you all right?

16:43.502 --> 16:44.764
I'm fine.

16:53.645 --> 16:56.307
You can't come every couple of months
and expect to get anything done.

16:56.382 --> 16:57.872
I've been busy.

16:58.917 --> 17:02.250
- Fighting crime.
- Small town. What do you expect?

17:02.321 --> 17:04.346
What I've come to expect.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.920
You take a job you're overqualified for.

17:07.992 --> 17:10.290
You're good at what you do,
so you stir the pot.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.989
Up comes a couple of rats.

17:12.064 --> 17:15.556
But for all intents and purposes,
nothing happens here.

17:16.335 --> 17:19.327
You know what I'm talking about.
You were a cop.

17:19.405 --> 17:20.929
Yeah, but I quit.

17:21.006 --> 17:23.031
Because it made you drink?

17:23.675 --> 17:26.108
I think that's called projection.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.981
So, you called me.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.241
In a moment of weakness.

17:33.318 --> 17:36.845
Is that what happened last night?
A moment of weakness?

17:36.922 --> 17:37.980
No.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.956
Did you talk to your ex-wife?

17:41.026 --> 17:43.620
You think that's what makes me drink?

17:44.129 --> 17:46.222
Do you drink when you work?

17:46.432 --> 17:47.456
No.

17:47.866 --> 17:51.563
- So then you drink when you get home.
- I have two drinks.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.105
Did you have two drinks last night?

17:54.540 --> 17:55.564
No.

17:55.641 --> 17:56.972
And did you talk to your ex-wife?

17:57.042 --> 18:01.138
- I talk to her every night.
- And did you speak with her last night?

18:01.980 --> 18:04.278
Are you sensing a breakthrough?

18:10.189 --> 18:13.556
Do you drink when you're involved
in a serious crime?

18:14.159 --> 18:16.423
- No.
- Because?

18:16.495 --> 18:18.292
It would be unprofessional.

18:18.363 --> 18:19.762
So you stop.

18:20.466 --> 18:21.728
Yes.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.927
As long as you need to.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.402
- Yes.
- And how long do you need to?

18:27.473 --> 18:29.668
- It depends.
- On what?

18:30.809 --> 18:32.709
On how long I need to.

18:36.248 --> 18:39.706
If you've got nothing to do, pal,
find something to do.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.782
If it's not important, make it important.

19:03.575 --> 19:05.873
Rose, where do we keep
the unsolved cases?

19:05.944 --> 19:08.640
You mean, where do I keep
the unsolved cases?

19:08.714 --> 19:11.444
- What kind of cases?
- I want a homicide.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.445
There's three.

19:13.519 --> 19:16.886
1905, 1923 and 1992.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.650
- You know?
- Yes.

19:18.724 --> 19:22.285
- How do you know?
- I'm the dispatcher. I know everything.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.460
Molly rearranged my files.
I rearranged them back.

19:28.634 --> 19:29.896
1992.

19:30.802 --> 19:34.602
- You said you wanted to get in the field.
- Not in this field.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.506
- And you're sure you can find it.
- I'm sure.

19:37.576 --> 19:41.376
No other customers.
Just the bank guard, Hasty Hathaway,

19:41.446 --> 19:43.311
and the bank teller.

19:43.382 --> 19:46.818
Robber takes the teller hostage,
uses her as a shield.

19:46.885 --> 19:50.116
The bank guard gets off an errant shot
as he's dragging her out the door.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.952
And they disappear.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.357
You know, in six months,
none of this is gonna be here.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.055
Some guy bought out the whole point.
Going to put up 40 houses.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.189
- Rich people from Boston.
- Do me a favor,

20:00.265 --> 20:03.098
tell the town council
not to reassess and raise my taxes.

20:03.168 --> 20:05.728
A tenuous relationship at best.

20:05.804 --> 20:08.830
Ever since our friend Hasty resigned,
they don't seem to understand

20:08.907 --> 20:10.875
why I was hired to begin with.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.241
But I will tell them just the same.

20:13.312 --> 20:14.836
Anyway, two years later,

20:14.913 --> 20:17.780
some hunters find the teller's body
in a shallow grave.

20:17.849 --> 20:20.818
- Why are you so sure you can find it?
- It would be hard to forget.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.150
- Because?
- I threw up all over the body,

20:23.222 --> 20:24.951
first time I saw it.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.791
That would be a reason.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.573
I'll have a cappuccino.

20:47.946 --> 20:50.744
I threw up, first time I found a body.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.443
That's comforting.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.210
And that's when Lou pulled you out
of the field?

20:55.287 --> 20:57.812
Yeah, well, he promoted me to dispatcher.

20:57.889 --> 20:59.948
- And this is the spot?
- Yup.

21:00.525 --> 21:04.359
- How do you know?
- This is the rock I sat on after I threw up.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.994
- Is this about the right depth?
- Yeah.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.170
Oh, my God! The grave is empty!

21:16.141 --> 21:19.633
Maybe that's because
the body was removed 13 years ago.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.203
Jesse, what are we doing?

21:22.748 --> 21:25.239
We're waiting for a clue to pop up.

21:26.084 --> 21:30.384
We had this coroner in LA,
stubborn Asian guy.

21:31.156 --> 21:34.250
He recovered this body in a shallow grave
and he just kept saying,

21:34.326 --> 21:37.921
- "Dig deeper, dig deeper."
- Because he was Asian?

21:37.996 --> 21:40.089
No, because he was stubborn.

21:40.165 --> 21:43.862
And anytime someone would ask,
"Why?" like you keep doing,

21:43.935 --> 21:46.927
he'd say,
"Because, I'm a stubborn Asian guy."

21:47.406 --> 21:48.498
Why?

21:50.108 --> 21:55.740
That's not the point.
The point is he dug up the murder weapon.

22:04.923 --> 22:07.357
That was sloppy police work, Lou.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.366
Thank you.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.902
- Think she's afraid of me.
- Oh, she'll be okay.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.370
- Can I talk to her?
- She won't talk to you, Luther.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.845
- Because?
- Because she's afraid of you.

22:28.914 --> 22:32.111
- DeAngelo.
- So, Luther, do you remember anything?

22:35.120 --> 22:36.849
I remember cookies.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.155
And I remember juice.

22:42.594 --> 22:45.961
- Cranberry juice.
- You were shot in a market, Luther.

22:46.565 --> 22:47.589
Oh.

22:50.802 --> 22:53.498
Anything new on the drug case, Lou?

22:53.572 --> 22:54.903
Excuse me?

22:56.608 --> 22:58.872
Anything new on the drug case?

23:01.880 --> 23:03.279
Not really.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.358
And no blood at the scene?

23:20.432 --> 23:22.263
Apparently not.
There's nothing in the report.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.733
A lot of things aren't in the report.

23:23.802 --> 23:27.431
I know you were fond of your old boss,
but that report is a mess.

23:27.506 --> 23:28.666
And what was the robber wearing?

23:28.740 --> 23:31.208
Jesse, I know these are the robber's clothes.

23:31.276 --> 23:32.675
He didn't need a hostage anymore.

23:32.744 --> 23:36.339
So he shot the teller, buried her in
a shallow grave, changed his own clothes,

23:36.415 --> 23:38.280
buried them, so he wouldn't be recognized.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.875
Well, actually, he buried his clothes,
and then he buried the teller.

23:40.952 --> 23:42.510
That seem backwards to you?

23:42.587 --> 23:45.317
- I guess it could be.
- Lou should have found these.

23:45.390 --> 23:50.054
- He found the body. That's pretty big.
- Actually, some hunters found the body.

23:50.228 --> 23:52.992
And what do you suppose
made these holes?

23:53.064 --> 23:55.862
- Fifteen years underground?
- Organic matter.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.799
How was her body IDed?

23:59.371 --> 24:00.770
Her mother.

24:01.339 --> 24:03.000
Not even dental records?

24:03.074 --> 24:04.803
Mary Lewis came in,

24:04.876 --> 24:08.277
looked at the body, and said,
"That's my little girl."

24:10.449 --> 24:11.746
Excuse me.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.616
- I'm Chief Stone.
- My name's Sam Holton.

24:19.691 --> 24:21.488
My daughter Cathleen.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.723
Why don't we go into my office?
Officer Gammon?

24:30.502 --> 24:33.733
We had just passed Paradise cove
when it happened.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.969
On one of those yachts
that come up for Race Week.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.600
What happened?

24:38.677 --> 24:40.076
I was raped.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.641
- Do you know who did it?
- The owner of the boat.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.650
- Do you know the name of the boat?
- The Lady Jane:

24:46.718 --> 24:49.084
Could you pick the owner out of a lineup?

24:49.154 --> 24:50.246
Yeah.

24:51.056 --> 24:55.823
Good. Officer Gammon will take the rest
of your report, and we'll look into it.

24:55.894 --> 24:57.885
Now if you'll excuse me.

25:02.133 --> 25:04.863
- Have you talked to your wife?
- Ex-wife.

25:06.304 --> 25:10.138
I'll take that as a no.
I thought you spoke to her every night.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.233
- Not lately.
- Why not?

25:12.744 --> 25:15.713
- She's seeing someone.
- At night?

25:16.481 --> 25:17.675
Yes.

25:17.749 --> 25:19.808
- At your house?
- Oh, yeah.

25:20.719 --> 25:22.846
How do you feel about that?

25:23.555 --> 25:25.523
Like I want to kill him.

25:34.466 --> 25:37.924
Do you imagine her with him? Having sex?

25:42.941 --> 25:44.033
Yes.

25:45.143 --> 25:47.475
- Does she tell you about it?
- No.

25:48.313 --> 25:50.508
So, in fact, you don't know
what she's doing.

25:50.582 --> 25:52.447
I don't know anything.

26:00.258 --> 26:01.885
So you invent it.

26:04.095 --> 26:06.928
How long have you been inventing her life?

26:10.001 --> 26:13.129
- I'll take that as an always.
- Not always.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.200
Since the divorce?

26:18.143 --> 26:20.236
You're pretty good at this.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.713
How many years does it take
to be a psychiatrist?

26:23.782 --> 26:26.808
- Ten.
- You got to go to medical school first?

26:28.620 --> 26:30.611
I got a question for you.

26:30.689 --> 26:32.384
A medical question?

26:32.958 --> 26:35.153
A medical cop question.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.488
Is this important?

26:39.364 --> 26:40.729
I hope so.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.463
What's the question?

26:44.002 --> 26:46.835
Bugs go after organic matter first, right?

26:47.405 --> 26:50.533
What kind of bugs?
What kind of organic matter?

26:51.443 --> 26:55.504
Well, I got these clothes.
And they've been buried for about 15 years.

26:55.580 --> 26:56.808
They're pretty deteriorated.

26:56.881 --> 27:02.148
But there's two big holes,
one on the shirt and one in the jacket.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.383
And they line up.
I'm thinking it might be blood.

27:06.725 --> 27:08.556
You know what I think?

27:09.260 --> 27:11.854
I think you won't be drinking tonight.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.079
What are you looking at?

27:48.967 --> 27:54.735
Hi, Jesse: It's Jenn: I guess you already left:
I'll call you at the office:

27:58.910 --> 28:04.246
Hi, Jesse: It's Jenn: I guess you already left:
I'll call you at the office:

28:58.203 --> 28:59.898
So, where's Stone?

29:00.338 --> 29:01.828
Town council.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.331
You interview the rape victim?

29:04.409 --> 29:05.740
Basically.

29:05.810 --> 29:08.438
Don't you think he should have been there?

29:08.513 --> 29:11.346
I mean, he's always the first one at work.

29:11.916 --> 29:14.009
But he wasn't the other day.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.586
- That's correct.
- Why do you think that is?

29:19.324 --> 29:23.488
- You know what I think?
- Tony, I don't really care what you think.

29:24.829 --> 29:30.028
Rabid skunk is no longer a threat.
Office DeAngelo expressed his regrets.

29:30.101 --> 29:33.298
Sixty-three parking tickets.
Fourteen traffic stops.

29:33.371 --> 29:37.068
And Edwin claims the Civil War Memorial
has been vandalized.

29:37.408 --> 29:38.966
You don't think it has been?

29:39.043 --> 29:41.944
Maybe you could tell him
he's watering too much.

29:42.013 --> 29:44.004
What about this rape case?

29:45.049 --> 29:46.346
What about it?

29:46.417 --> 29:48.408
- Anyone arrested?
- No.

29:48.987 --> 29:51.148
- Good.
- Rape out of season?

29:51.222 --> 29:54.385
Now, the merchants need Race Week.
They don't need a scandal.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.585
I know that.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.753
The fall regatta brings in a lot of revenue.

29:57.829 --> 29:59.763
Including your paycheck.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.330
So how have you been?

30:05.136 --> 30:06.330
Fine.

30:06.404 --> 30:07.894
No problems?

30:07.972 --> 30:09.030
No.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.638
No personal issues?

30:16.447 --> 30:18.972
Anything we need to know about?

30:19.050 --> 30:23.510
Yes, my deputy doesn't want you to
reassess her house and raise her taxes.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.395
What are you looking at?

30:41.472 --> 30:44.373
I was admiring the rigging on the Lady Jane:

30:46.411 --> 30:48.402
What do you use for bait?

30:48.980 --> 30:52.006
Bugs, worms, last night's supper.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.483
- Catch much?
- Don't catch spit.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.149
Plenty of fish, though.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.314
Yep.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.991
Maybe you should just shoot them.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.221
The fish or the bank robbers?

31:08.199 --> 31:09.996
You a good shot, Bob?

31:10.668 --> 31:13.967
I'm a certified expert with a pistol
in the Army.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.335
Which war?

31:15.406 --> 31:16.566
Korea.

31:17.275 --> 31:18.867
You a good shot now?

31:18.943 --> 31:20.433
I don't know.

31:21.012 --> 31:22.479
How old are you, Bob?

31:22.547 --> 31:23.946
Seventy-six.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.617
You a good shot when you were 61?

31:28.119 --> 31:29.711
I thought I was.

31:30.221 --> 31:33.782
You had to be qualified to be a bank guard.

31:36.494 --> 31:40.658
Have you ever been in a hostage situation,
Chief Stone?

31:42.700 --> 31:43.860
Yes.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.330
Did you take the shot?

31:49.173 --> 31:50.197
Yes.

31:50.275 --> 31:51.606
So did I.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.669
I reached for my back-up
and I went to the door.

31:56.547 --> 31:59.482
I saw him in my front sight.

32:01.152 --> 32:04.178
I figured he'd kill Rebecca
when he didn't need her.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.485
Well, you figured right, Bob.

32:08.159 --> 32:10.650
What caliber bullet killed Rebecca?

32:13.398 --> 32:16.856
- .38.
- Now that's what I was shooting.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.194
You don't think that I...

32:23.007 --> 32:25.601
No. And I don't think you should.

32:26.511 --> 32:27.773
Why is that?

32:27.845 --> 32:29.938
Not healthy. It will drive you to drink.

32:30.014 --> 32:31.413
Already did.

32:32.483 --> 32:34.747
Six years sober come December.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.957
- And when did this happen?
- Four days ago.

32:43.027 --> 32:45.257
Cathleen, we have no evidence of this.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.093
So, you think I was lying?

32:47.165 --> 32:50.225
It doesn't mean you're lying.
It just means there was no sperm.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.292
He was wearing a rubber.

32:53.571 --> 32:56.267
I thought it was best
if Cathleen and I discussed this.

32:56.341 --> 32:58.275
The rape test was inconclusive.

32:58.343 --> 33:02.803
Why don't you tell us the part
you didn't want your dad to hear, Cathleen?

33:03.681 --> 33:05.842
They made me do a striptease.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.683
- Were you drinking?
- Yes.

33:09.620 --> 33:13.112
They said I had to do a striptease
or they wouldn't take me back to shore.

33:13.191 --> 33:14.522
Who's they?

33:14.826 --> 33:18.762
The guy that raped me and two other guys.
They said I had to strip.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.593
So you're saying they forced you?

33:20.665 --> 33:22.064
Yes.

33:22.133 --> 33:25.159
And then the guy who owned the boat
took me downstairs.

33:25.236 --> 33:26.897
I thought, you know,
so I could get dressed again.

33:26.971 --> 33:29.405
But he just threw me on the bed
and raped me. He was like an animal.

33:29.474 --> 33:31.738
Just threw me down and jumped on me.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.606
But he wore a condom.

33:33.678 --> 33:34.838
Yes.

33:34.912 --> 33:38.143
Did he put that on just before
he jumped on you like an animal?

33:38.216 --> 33:39.649
Yeah, just before.

33:39.717 --> 33:42.151
- Was it in a packet?
- Yes.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.484
Did he have to open the packet?

33:45.490 --> 33:47.117
I don't remember.

33:52.797 --> 33:55.095
You think she's lying?
You don't think she was raped?

33:55.166 --> 33:57.327
- I didn't say that.
- Well, I think we can get a warrant.

33:57.402 --> 33:59.097
Sure, we can get a warrant,
but I don't want to.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.035
Since when do you care
what the town council thinks?

34:01.105 --> 34:03.369
I don't. But I do care about Paradise.

34:03.441 --> 34:08.504
You prosecute a rape case in a resort town,
all the cable news channels will live here.

34:08.579 --> 34:11.446
And no rape shield law will protect that kid.

34:11.516 --> 34:15.213
Legally, she's not a kid.
I think it's blood on his clothes.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.717
Excuse me?

34:18.255 --> 34:21.315
I want to test the robber's clothes for blood.

34:22.126 --> 34:25.994
So, after he shot the teller,
he dragged the body to the grave

34:26.063 --> 34:27.496
and got blood on his clothes. So what?

34:27.565 --> 34:30.728
So what?
How much money was taken in the robbery?

34:30.802 --> 34:32.860
Just the cash that was in the bank. $24,000.

34:32.937 --> 34:35.132
- Hardly worth a life.
- Jesse, what's the point?

34:35.206 --> 34:39.505
The point is this isn't just a robbery,
Officer Gammon, it's murder.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.375
And the guy got away with it.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.712
This report doesn't even say whether
she was shot from the front or the back.

34:45.783 --> 34:48.717
- No, it doesn't.
- And I'm not happy with the ID of the body.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.346
- You don't want to run a DNA test?
- I do.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.686
You don't think a mother could recognize
her own daughter?

34:53.757 --> 34:55.282
Not after two years underground.

34:55.359 --> 34:58.487
- She recognized the clothes.
- And where are they?

34:59.297 --> 35:01.265
Lou returned the effects to the family.

35:01.332 --> 35:03.664
- Jesse, this stuff isn't important!
- I think it is.

35:03.734 --> 35:05.998
- Why?
- Because I need it to be!

35:22.320 --> 35:25.221
What was the mother's
last known whereabouts?

35:25.490 --> 35:27.549
Sisters of Mercy Hospital. Up north.

35:27.625 --> 35:28.819
Jesse,

35:30.461 --> 35:33.328
I think DeAngelo went to the town council.

35:34.365 --> 35:36.356
I would expect no less of him.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.334
They're laying for you.

35:38.402 --> 35:42.736
The ugly truth of it, Rose, is it doesn't
matter a whole hell of a lot to me.

35:42.807 --> 35:46.334
Jesse, you need to concentrate
on the rape case.

35:50.648 --> 35:51.842
I know.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.240
You're right.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.150
Thank you.

37:11.495 --> 37:13.190
- Yes?
- I'm Jesse Stone.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.425
The Police Chief in Paradise.

37:15.499 --> 37:17.797
You're a long way from home.

37:17.868 --> 37:20.063
I was looking for Mary Lewis.

37:20.137 --> 37:21.764
My mom's resting.

37:23.007 --> 37:25.032
You look like your sister.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.208
This is about Rebecca.

37:27.945 --> 37:29.207
Yes.

37:29.280 --> 37:33.182
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Leeann Lewis. Come in.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.582
Thank you.

37:44.128 --> 37:46.926
You can speak to her
but she won't speak back.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.727
My mom had a stroke.

37:50.334 --> 37:54.100
- Momma, this is...
- Jesse Stone, Mrs. Lewis.

37:55.406 --> 37:57.704
I was just visiting with Leeann.

38:02.413 --> 38:05.109
- Would you like some coffee?
- I would.

38:07.652 --> 38:09.847
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Lewis.

38:18.529 --> 38:20.622
When did your mom have the stroke?

38:20.698 --> 38:23.258
The day after she identified Rebecca.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.194
Thank you for not upsetting her.

38:25.269 --> 38:27.794
I assume you have the power of attorney.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.271
I thought this case was closed.

38:30.341 --> 38:32.138
No. Just cold.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.606
What do you want, Chief Stone?

38:35.980 --> 38:39.040
Probably what you want.
Justice for your sister.

38:39.717 --> 38:42.447
I'd like permission to exhume the body.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.289
My sister was cremated.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.583
Okay.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.922
This is old. I'm gonna get you a new pot.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.260
Did you see your sister's body?

38:54.332 --> 38:55.390
No.

38:55.966 --> 38:59.902
Maybe my mother wouldn't have had
her stroke if I had been here.

38:59.970 --> 39:04.270
I wouldn't beat yourself up.
You've obviously devoted yourself to her.

39:04.842 --> 39:08.573
I left my job in LA
and I got her out of that hospital,

39:08.646 --> 39:10.944
and we've been here ever since.

39:12.049 --> 39:13.949
Long way from Paradise.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.180
Too many memories.

39:17.922 --> 39:21.050
Do you have any personal effects
of your sister? Pictures?

39:21.125 --> 39:22.149
Why?

39:22.226 --> 39:25.024
Well, it's just the way I work.
It gives me a sense of the person.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.462
Frankly, there's not much in our files.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.694
We really don't want to open old wounds
unless there's a reason.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.963
Oh, I think there's a reason.

39:34.305 --> 39:37.570
Well, I got rid of all that stuff
after the funeral.

39:38.242 --> 39:41.006
- That upset your mom?
- Yeah.

39:42.346 --> 39:44.371
Frankly, it upset me, too.

39:46.283 --> 39:47.648
I'm sorry.

39:49.854 --> 39:52.220
This is going to take a while.

39:52.289 --> 39:54.883
Do you still want coffee, Chief Stone?

39:54.959 --> 39:56.256
Jesse.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.521
Jesse.

39:58.596 --> 40:01.463
Coffee would be good. It's a long way back.

40:11.876 --> 40:13.036
Jesse,

40:14.812 --> 40:17.747
- would you like to eat at the bar?
- Sure, Laura.

40:17.815 --> 40:18.907
Okay.

40:22.420 --> 40:26.015
I thought I'd stop by,
see if you need any help fighting crime.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.650
What's happening at home
that you'd rather be here?

40:28.726 --> 40:30.591
- Nothing.
- Not nothing.

40:33.631 --> 40:37.260
My wife's younger brother
is visiting, with his wife.

40:38.202 --> 40:39.794
They have young children.

40:39.870 --> 40:42.065
You don't care for young children?

40:42.139 --> 40:45.370
Neither of us do. But it's her brother.

40:46.243 --> 40:49.337
So you dropping by
is not all about helping me.

40:49.713 --> 40:51.704
It's nothing about that.

40:52.082 --> 40:53.572
Are you staying for dinner?

40:53.651 --> 40:55.983
Can I tell my wife it's business?

40:56.420 --> 41:01.255
You can, if you crank up your lab for me.
There's something I want you to check.

41:01.592 --> 41:03.526
Can't Doc Perkins do it?

41:03.594 --> 41:06.290
I don't want to destroy his confidence.

41:06.764 --> 41:10.860
Even State Homicide operates on a budget.
This stuff costs money.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.527
Is it important?

41:13.270 --> 41:14.828
I have no idea.

41:16.907 --> 41:19.637
Will you call my wife for me?

41:21.212 --> 41:22.338
Okay.

41:23.013 --> 41:25.004
That'll crank up the lab.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.744
You know, marriage is hard for cops.

41:31.255 --> 41:35.157
And the only people we know
how to talk to are the women we marry.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.387
Then the marriage breaks up,

41:38.028 --> 41:39.996
and you need to talk to someone,

41:40.064 --> 41:43.556
the only person you can't talk to
is the woman you married.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.602
When did Molly call you?

41:47.972 --> 41:50.406
The morning after you woke her up.

41:52.910 --> 41:55.902
Captain Healy will be joining me
for dinner, Laura.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.949
- What can I get for you?
- Scotch on the rocks.

41:59.483 --> 42:02.418
- And another for the Chief.
- I'm good, Laura.

42:17.268 --> 42:20.203
- Have you talked to the son of a bitch?
- No.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.473
But I will be talking to the son of a bitch.

42:23.941 --> 42:27.775
Why'd Cathleen drop out of high school
before her senior year?

42:30.447 --> 42:33.245
What's that have to do
with her being raped?

42:33.317 --> 42:34.784
I don't know.

42:35.986 --> 42:37.248
I tried.

42:37.755 --> 42:41.486
She just wouldn't go. I couldn't make her.
I work all day.

42:42.092 --> 42:43.855
- Her mom is...
- Gone.

42:45.296 --> 42:48.459
Took off with some guy
when Cathleen was just six.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.197
Look...

42:53.904 --> 42:57.601
I'm sorry, Chief Stone.
This whole thing's just got me...

42:59.143 --> 43:00.542
Pissed off?

43:05.015 --> 43:06.983
She came home very late.

43:08.452 --> 43:10.113
I confronted her.

43:10.988 --> 43:14.446
She got real upset and it all just came out.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.395
Well, two things you need to know.

43:18.462 --> 43:20.589
One is I'm going to talk
to the son of a bitch.

43:20.664 --> 43:24.532
And two, you're going to stay away
from the son of a bitch.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.092
Because?

43:26.170 --> 43:28.365
Because I'm the Police Chief.

44:01.338 --> 44:02.532
Jesse.

44:05.009 --> 44:07.273
Boy, I do not get many visitors.

44:07.344 --> 44:09.209
So, how are you doing, Hasty?

44:09.279 --> 44:11.247
You don't say "How are you doing?"
To a convict.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.146
Okay. How's it going?

44:14.418 --> 44:19.754
Well, I teach illiterate prisoners to read.
I give financial advice to the guards.

44:21.191 --> 44:23.159
How's the drinking thing?

44:23.427 --> 44:25.554
Better since I gave up hope.

44:26.730 --> 44:29.324
- How is my wife?
- Ex-wife, Hasty.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.629
- How is she doing?
- Cissy is Cissy.

44:34.238 --> 44:37.207
- But she's okay?
- Yes.

44:38.142 --> 44:40.838
Jesse, you and Cissy,

44:42.379 --> 44:43.937
you never...

44:44.014 --> 44:46.107
No, we never.

44:48.986 --> 44:50.851
So, no hard feelings?

44:50.921 --> 44:52.752
Hey, a guy saves your life.

44:52.823 --> 44:55.018
Albeit for the wrong reasons.

44:56.260 --> 44:58.251
What are you doing here?

45:00.364 --> 45:04.266
Your bank was robbed in 1992.
Teller was killed.

45:04.334 --> 45:05.733
Yeah, Rebecca. Nice kid.

45:05.803 --> 45:07.896
And what do you remember about it?

45:07.971 --> 45:09.233
Nothing.

45:09.306 --> 45:11.934
Hasty, you can't be put away twice
for money laundering.

45:12.009 --> 45:13.442
- I know that.
- So?

45:13.510 --> 45:16.240
- So I just didn't see anything.
- Because?

45:17.481 --> 45:20.712
Because I was hiding under my desk
the whole time.

45:21.118 --> 45:23.848
There were no surveillance cameras
in your bank.

45:23.921 --> 45:24.910
Small town.

45:24.988 --> 45:28.151
Were you laundering money
for Gino Fish back then?

45:28.625 --> 45:29.683
No.

45:31.862 --> 45:33.989
No, on my sacred honor, no.

45:37.634 --> 45:39.363
You know, Hasty,
when I said you saved my life,

45:39.436 --> 45:42.633
I wasn't talking about the night
I arrested you.

45:42.706 --> 45:45.800
I meant you saved my life
because you hired me.

45:47.144 --> 45:49.339
Albeit for the wrong reasons.

45:50.214 --> 45:52.341
I'm very fond of you, Jesse.

45:55.419 --> 45:56.943
See you, Hasty.

46:07.297 --> 46:08.389
Suit.

46:08.999 --> 46:11.593
Jesse! Where have you been, Skipper?

46:11.668 --> 46:13.329
Fighting crime.

46:13.403 --> 46:16.167
- Rose at the orthodontist again?
- Yeah.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.468
How you feeling?

46:17.541 --> 46:20.009
- Perfect.
- You lost a little weight.

46:21.912 --> 46:24.506
I'm not much good with the phones.

46:24.581 --> 46:27.345
- You supposed to be here?
- They let me out of the hospital.

46:27.417 --> 46:29.578
They say it was okay to go back to work?

46:29.653 --> 46:31.348
Well, I didn't ask.

46:31.855 --> 46:35.382
Well, I need you to answer the phones
for now, Suitcase.

46:37.127 --> 46:39.095
How do you feel about that?

46:39.163 --> 46:41.597
I don't like it. I feel fine, Lou.

46:44.001 --> 46:45.127
Okay.

46:53.644 --> 46:56.545
- Boy, that thing's a mess.
- Tell me about it.

46:56.613 --> 46:59.707
The folder's torn, the pictures are dirty,
the papers are all wrinkled.

46:59.783 --> 47:02.183
- Well, I threw it across the room.
- Why'd you do that?

47:02.252 --> 47:04.015
Because it's a mess.

47:06.490 --> 47:10.085
I think DeAngelo wants your job.
I feel it in my cells.

47:10.694 --> 47:14.755
Well, actually, he thinks he should have had
the job to begin with.

47:15.566 --> 47:18.364
I'd like to help you with your drug case.

47:18.769 --> 47:22.205
Suit, do you remember anything about
your stay at the hospital?

47:22.272 --> 47:23.330
No.

47:23.874 --> 47:25.102
Okay.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.075
What did you think about the bank robbery?

47:27.144 --> 47:28.406
I think you're on to something.

47:28.478 --> 47:29.911
Well, Rose doesn't think so.

47:29.980 --> 47:31.345
Rose hasn't been in the field.

47:31.415 --> 47:33.849
- Well, she threw up.
- Was she sick?

47:35.619 --> 47:37.348
It's not important.

47:38.088 --> 47:41.888
You know, I think we should check
for blood on those clothes you found.

47:43.327 --> 47:47.423
You know, there might be an upside
to this coma thing.

47:47.497 --> 47:48.964
What are you talking about?

47:49.032 --> 47:51.364
You know what I'm talking about.

47:53.437 --> 47:54.927
You mean...

47:56.106 --> 47:57.164
Yes.

47:57.241 --> 47:58.833
Coply intuition.

47:59.243 --> 48:01.370
Now you're as crazy as I am.

48:19.263 --> 48:21.788
Well, Inspector Yokel.

48:21.865 --> 48:23.992
Actually, it's Chief Yokel.

48:24.701 --> 48:27.363
- Where's your badge?
- It's in a drawer.

48:29.039 --> 48:30.666
This your boat?

48:30.741 --> 48:33.232
Why, you don't think
I could afford a boat like this?

48:33.310 --> 48:35.210
The Lady Jane is mine.

48:35.279 --> 48:37.975
I'm Chief Stone. This is Officer Gammon.

48:38.048 --> 48:40.448
- I'm Harrison.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Harrison.

48:40.517 --> 48:44.248
Well, Harrison is my first name.
I'm Harrison Pendleton.

48:44.321 --> 48:46.289
I see. Nice boat.

48:46.356 --> 48:47.584
Schooner.

48:48.926 --> 48:52.293
Officer Gammon would like
to ask you a few questions.

48:57.634 --> 49:00.364
Do you know a Cathleen Holton?

49:01.104 --> 49:02.366
I do.

49:02.439 --> 49:05.306
- Was she a guest on your schooner?
- Yes.

49:05.375 --> 49:06.535
When?

49:06.610 --> 49:10.171
Four days ago. She joined some friends
and me for an evening cruise.

49:10.247 --> 49:12.579
Do you know how old she is?

49:12.649 --> 49:15.550
Yes. 18 years and two months.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.587
She showed me her ID.

49:18.989 --> 49:21.651
I was wondering
if you could show me below.

49:21.725 --> 49:23.590
Do you have a warrant?

49:24.194 --> 49:25.183
No.

49:25.896 --> 49:27.386
Well, then no.

49:32.703 --> 49:34.500
Guy's got two last names.

49:34.571 --> 49:37.005
You might have briefed me that
I was going to question the suspect.

49:37.074 --> 49:39.668
Well, I'm not sure he's a suspect.

49:39.743 --> 49:42.371
But I thought you handled it well.

49:42.446 --> 49:44.414
Till you got pissed off.

49:48.285 --> 49:49.946
Jesse, why don't you get a cell phone?

49:50.020 --> 49:52.648
'Cause I don't like them.
You can always page me.

49:52.723 --> 49:53.917
I have.

49:54.624 --> 49:56.524
Well, call me on the car radio.

49:56.593 --> 49:58.151
I have.

49:58.228 --> 50:00.924
You've been spending a lot of time
away from the office.

50:00.998 --> 50:02.158
I have.

50:02.599 --> 50:03.827
At home?

50:04.534 --> 50:05.523
No.

50:05.836 --> 50:06.928
Good.

50:08.205 --> 50:11.140
So, I assume you've talked
to the bank guard.

50:12.676 --> 50:13.700
I did.

50:13.777 --> 50:16.007
Have you talked to the mother?

50:16.079 --> 50:17.842
Actually, I didn't.

50:19.249 --> 50:20.944
What are you doing?

50:35.298 --> 50:36.788
Run that plate.

50:50.847 --> 50:53.179
License and registration, please.

50:55.719 --> 50:58.153
Did I do something wrong, Officer?

50:58.488 --> 51:02.686
You have no front license plate, Mr. Genest.

51:04.628 --> 51:06.596
I knew someone named Genest.

51:06.663 --> 51:08.824
- Joe Genest?
- He your brother?

51:09.433 --> 51:11.094
He was my brother.

51:12.869 --> 51:14.803
I tell you what.

51:14.871 --> 51:18.272
I'm gonna let you off
on the license plate, just put one on.

51:18.341 --> 51:19.535
Thank you, Officer.

51:19.609 --> 51:21.133
One more thing.

51:23.246 --> 51:25.476
Don't follow me around, Terry.

51:31.688 --> 51:35.784
I wouldn't have surveillance cameras
in my bank if I were laundering money.

51:35.859 --> 51:38.054
Well, neither would I
if I was laundering money.

51:38.128 --> 51:41.063
- When did you call Gino Fish?
- What?

51:41.131 --> 51:43.224
When did you call Gino Fish?

51:49.539 --> 51:51.336
Right after you left.

51:51.608 --> 51:54.509
- Now, Jesse...
- I know, you're very fond of me.

51:54.578 --> 51:56.478
How much money was really in the bank?

51:56.546 --> 51:58.776
Twenty-four thousand dollars.

52:05.522 --> 52:06.716
A lot.

52:11.461 --> 52:13.224
Two million dollars.

52:16.299 --> 52:17.664
You think the robber knew?

52:17.734 --> 52:21.568
Not if I was doing my job right.
How did you know?

52:21.638 --> 52:26.200
Gino had some guy following me around.
Turned out to be Joe Genest's brother.

52:28.145 --> 52:31.410
Terence Genest.
Do you think he knows I killed Joe?

52:31.481 --> 52:34.382
Hasty, everybody knows you killed Joe.

52:34.451 --> 52:36.146
Well, Jesse, this is a really bad guy.

52:36.219 --> 52:37.345
I would assume so.

52:37.420 --> 52:39.513
This is the kind of guy
that would hold a grudge.

52:39.589 --> 52:42.615
I would assume so, especially since
you weren't prosecuted for it.

52:42.692 --> 52:44.216
In defense of a police officer's life.

52:44.294 --> 52:47.491
Well, I'm not sure Mr. Genest
makes those kind of distinctions.

52:47.564 --> 52:50.397
I'm not sure he makes distinctions, period.

52:50.467 --> 52:53.925
Jesse, you know, you might need to
be a little careful.

52:57.908 --> 52:59.239
Excuse me.

53:00.143 --> 53:02.771
- Your boss in?
- Do you have an appointment?

53:02.846 --> 53:04.609
I'm with the police.

53:06.449 --> 53:08.212
Can I see your badge?

53:08.718 --> 53:09.742
No.

53:11.288 --> 53:12.755
What police department is that?

53:12.822 --> 53:14.585
- Paradise.
- Paradise?

53:15.292 --> 53:18.989
Is your interest personal or professional?

53:19.062 --> 53:20.927
I'll talk with the boss.

53:20.997 --> 53:24.194
Mr. Fish never sees anyone
without an appointment.

53:24.968 --> 53:27.664
- And your name is?
- Alan.

53:28.338 --> 53:29.464
Alan.

53:30.340 --> 53:33.901
Well, we can do this easy
or we can do this hard, Alan.

53:33.977 --> 53:37.071
Easy is I go in, sit down,
and chat with your boss.

53:37.147 --> 53:40.207
Hard is I call Captain Healy,
the State Homicide Commander,

53:40.283 --> 53:42.945
and bring your boss in for questioning.

53:44.688 --> 53:45.985
I'll talk to Mr. Fish.

53:56.333 --> 53:57.766
Jesse Stone.

53:59.002 --> 54:00.731
I know who you are.

54:01.304 --> 54:05.035
As I recall, you thought I should be
arrested during the Hasty Hathaway trial.

54:05.108 --> 54:06.666
That would be me.

54:06.743 --> 54:08.904
Have you spoken to Hasty lately?

54:08.979 --> 54:11.379
I've never spoken to Mr. Hathaway.

54:13.583 --> 54:17.519
I have some questions about
an employee of yours, Terry Genest.

54:18.188 --> 54:19.917
I have no such employee.

54:19.990 --> 54:22.185
You employed his brother Joe.

54:23.460 --> 54:25.360
That was never proven.

54:28.965 --> 54:34.369
You lost a lot of money in
a bank robbery in Paradise in 1992.

54:34.437 --> 54:37.304
I've never been a depositor in Paradise.

54:37.374 --> 54:39.808
This isn't going very well, is it?

54:40.277 --> 54:41.505
Here's what I think.

54:41.578 --> 54:43.170
Think?

54:43.246 --> 54:44.941
Know, but can't prove.

54:45.015 --> 54:48.610
I think Hasty Hathaway was laundering
a lot of money for you.

54:48.685 --> 54:52.678
I think it was stolen in the robbery,
and you'd like to get what's left of it back.

54:52.756 --> 54:55.088
So you hired Joe Genest's brother,

54:55.158 --> 54:58.719
because you knew
he had a deep personal interest.

55:00.096 --> 55:01.563
That is quite a story.

55:01.631 --> 55:03.121
I think it is.

55:04.267 --> 55:06.735
I think I'll wait to see the movie.

55:07.070 --> 55:09.300
Nice to meet you, Jesse Stone.

55:38.968 --> 55:41.596
Chief Yokel, I came to say goodbye.

55:43.006 --> 55:45.941
- Was it something I said?
- No.

55:46.009 --> 55:48.034
It was something Harrison did.

55:48.111 --> 55:50.341
- You mind if I smoke?
- No.

55:50.413 --> 55:53.382
- Is this legal?
- No.

55:53.450 --> 55:56.942
Are you going to search me, cuff me,
and then arrest me?

55:57.987 --> 55:59.420
Are you carrying your gun?

55:59.489 --> 56:01.389
Always armed and ready.

56:05.695 --> 56:07.663
My name's Sybil Martin.

56:07.731 --> 56:09.096
Jesse Stone.

56:09.666 --> 56:12.328
I know. You married, Jesse?

56:12.936 --> 56:15.496
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

56:15.572 --> 56:18.200
Divorced. Every place but in my mind.

56:19.642 --> 56:20.939
I came to help you.

56:21.010 --> 56:23.342
With my relationship or my case?

56:23.880 --> 56:25.108
Both.

56:25.181 --> 56:27.172
Are you wondering what help
I'm going to bring?

56:27.250 --> 56:28.683
Breathlessly.

56:31.221 --> 56:35.885
Listen, I only met Harrison
a couple of days ago.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.451
He tapes himself having sex.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.958
Did he tape you having sex with him?

56:44.334 --> 56:45.460
Yeah.

56:46.136 --> 56:48.934
Were you aware he was taping you
having sex with him?

56:49.005 --> 56:50.097
Yes.

56:50.707 --> 56:55.735
But when I saw this tape of a kid,
I thought you should know.

56:57.247 --> 56:59.238
I'm going back to Boston.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.984
I come to Boston a lot.

57:04.721 --> 57:07.053
Well, let me give you my number.

57:09.092 --> 57:12.323
Boston's not far, as the crow flies.

57:12.395 --> 57:14.158
I'll have to drive.

57:20.503 --> 57:22.300
She likes you, Jesse.

57:23.173 --> 57:24.765
How do you know?

57:25.842 --> 57:27.207
I just know.

57:29.312 --> 57:31.746
So what about the bank case, Lou?

57:31.815 --> 57:33.146
I'm Jesse.

57:33.616 --> 57:36.346
Yeah, I know. What about the bank case?

57:38.054 --> 57:39.578
I don't have a clue.

57:39.656 --> 57:43.820
I think I'm throwing stuff against a wall
to see if anything sticks.

57:44.928 --> 57:47.123
Well, isn't that what cops do?

57:50.366 --> 57:52.163
You stirring the pot?

57:53.203 --> 57:54.534
Oh, yeah.

57:56.806 --> 57:58.535
- Well, what's come up?
- Nothing.

57:58.608 --> 58:00.576
- Not nothing.
- Nothing.

58:01.344 --> 58:02.777
What do we know so far, Jesse?

58:02.846 --> 58:06.043
Well, that there wasn't $24,000 in the bank.
There was...

58:06.115 --> 58:07.207
Two million.

58:07.283 --> 58:08.614
And it would make a hell of a lot more sense

58:08.685 --> 58:10.346
for the robber to take down
a small town bank, if...

58:10.420 --> 58:11.512
If the robber knew.

58:11.588 --> 58:14.386
- But the question is...
- How would he know?

58:15.425 --> 58:17.552
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what?

58:17.627 --> 58:19.288
Finish my sentences.

58:19.362 --> 58:20.829
Sorry, Jesse.

58:21.431 --> 58:25.800
What if the teller found out about the money
and was in on the robbery?

58:26.069 --> 58:30.028
- Doesn't fit with the facts.
- Yeah, I know, the robber killed the teller.

58:30.106 --> 58:33.166
But what if the guard hit
what he was aiming at?

58:33.576 --> 58:35.203
He obviously only wounded him.

58:35.278 --> 58:39.009
Maybe we can get Healy to check
emergency room records for May of '92.

58:39.082 --> 58:40.982
I mean the guy isn't going to say,

58:41.050 --> 58:44.508
"Doc, I just robbed a bank.
Can you fix me up, so I can get away?"

58:44.587 --> 58:47.021
So, accidental gunshot wounds.

58:47.724 --> 58:50.284
- Maybe we can get a name.
- Why don't you call him?

58:50.360 --> 58:51.554
Can I?

58:52.328 --> 58:53.522
You can.

58:54.330 --> 58:55.456
Good.

58:56.599 --> 58:58.464
That's good work, Suit.

59:00.236 --> 59:02.431
You're on to something, Jesse.

59:02.805 --> 59:04.670
I feel it in my cells.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.366
Oh.

59:10.280 --> 59:12.077
You had a phone call.

59:12.515 --> 59:14.676
My sense was it was personal.

59:32.936 --> 59:35.063
- Hello?
- Jesse Stone.

59:35.572 --> 59:39.508
Oh, I checked in storage and I couldn't find
anything that might help you.

59:39.576 --> 59:41.100
I'm so sorry:

59:42.245 --> 59:44.338
It's like she didn't exist.

59:45.114 --> 59:46.513
Regrets, Chief Stone.

59:47.650 --> 59:48.639
Jesse.

59:49.552 --> 59:50.746
Jesse.

59:52.855 --> 59:54.117
Listen,

59:56.025 --> 01:00:01.486
I know this is forward,
but if you're ever around here

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.191
I'd love to see you again.

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.960
Well, if you're ever in Paradise,
I'd love to see you.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.032
Well,

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:15.173
I can't get that far away from my mom so,

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:19.148
- I guess we're at an impasse:
- Not really.

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.589
It looks like she was having
a pretty good time stripping.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:05.594
Cathleen is apparently wise
beyond her years.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:10.221
And in my expert Police Chief's opinion,

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:13.063
it hardly looks like she was being raped.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:17.203
- Where did you get these?
- I accidentally found them.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.834
Where did you find them?

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:21.741
In a cabinet below decks on the Lady Jane:

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.806
I'd be interested to know what you think.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:28.783
- Do you think I should see them, Jesse?
- No.

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:08.348
Are you happy in your work?

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.892
What do you mean?

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.361
Well, there's this Japanese prison camp
commander in Bridge on the River Kwai,

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:19.629
and he just keeps telling these miserable
starving prisoners, "Be happy in your work."

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.929
You didn't see the movie.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.874
You happy in your work, Cathleen?

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.241
What are you talking about?

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:32.975
The point I was attempting to make
is this is a lousy job.

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:37.451
- You need some help with that?
- No.

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.923
Why'd you drop out of school, Cathleen?

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.656
Why are you here?

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:52.197
- You miss your mom?
- You've been checking up on me.

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.030
I have.

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:58.538
Don't talk to me about things
you don't know anything about.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.202
Actually, I know something about that.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.405
Your mom run off?

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:05.404
No. She died.

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:08.310
When I was eight.

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:12.318
I miss my mom a lot. Moms are important.

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:15.790
Well, you don't miss someone
you never knew.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:20.223
You know how to do hospital corners,
Chief Stone?

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:24.464
I do. And call me Jesse now that you're 18
and all grown up.

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:29.962
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you're not a kid anymore.

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:32.097
It means you're fair game.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:34.299
I saw the tape.

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:36.167
So?

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:40.308
It didn't look like anybody made you
take off your clothes.

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:43.011
So? That's no excuse for what he did.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:47.584
There's another tape.
Just you and Mr. Pendleton.

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:54.488
He had a hidden camera in his bedroom.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.533
I want you to tell your dad.

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.875
- Why should I?
- Because he loves you,

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:12.779
and I don't want to see your dad
do something stupid.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.817
Unintended consequences.

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:18.950
You're not supposed to be here.

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.655
No, I'm not.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.583
You're not supposed to try and talk me
out of this, are you?

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:25.149
That's correct.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.258
- I could get you in trouble.
- You could.

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:32.694
You don't think what he did was wrong?

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.896
It was wrong. But it wasn't illegal.

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:38.236
- Yeah, but he's...
- A grown-up?

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:41.736
You know what I think?

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:45.269
I think you don't like yourself so much
for what you did.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.908
I think you love your dad,
and you know how disappointed he'd be

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.679
if he knew the truth.

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:54.018
But you getting even with some sick son
of a bitch isn't going to change any of that.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.251
But at least then he won't do it again.

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:58.725
- Oh, he'll do it again.
- Why?

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:03.454
Because he can. And there's nothing you
or I can do to stop him.

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:05.830
You know,

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:09.833
you live long enough, you have regrets.

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:13.068
And the ones that nag at you the most

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:16.077
are the ones where you knew
you had a choice.

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:20.245
The ones where you knew
you could have stopped yourself.

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:24.685
The ones where you looked into the mirror
and everything good inside you said,

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.346
"Don't do this."

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:36.063
You go talk to your dad and I'll go
punch him in the mouth. How's that?

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:07.991
- The Paradise Motel.
- I know it well.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.624
As do I. I used to live there.

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:15.832
You're not following me around,
are you, Terry?

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:19.136
- I prefer Terence.
- And I prefer you didn't do that.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:21.676
- Do what?
- Follow me around, Terry.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:26.710
- Are you trying to provoke me?
- I was going to ask you the same thing.

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:32.414
- I'm just sitting here reading the paper.
- Did you get that license plate fixed, Terry?

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:34.584
Yes, I did, Officer.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:39.492
And since now I have a violation-free
motor vehicle, I'll drive it wherever I want.

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:43.293
I'll obey all traffic regulations
so as you can't harass me.

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:47.865
Unless you set me up, the way you did
my brother when you killed him.

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:50.771
I didn't kill your brother, Terry.

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:53.741
But I did set him up pretty good.

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:04.112
God, I miss her.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.788
- Scotch?
- For the lady.

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:11.523
Thank you.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.227
Thank you.

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:18.389
Long way back?

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:21.701
It is.

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:24.035
Thanks for meeting me halfway.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:28.777
Well, actually, it's three quarters to
one quarter, so, I guess you owe me.

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:35.379
Are you going to find the man
who killed my sister?

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:39.482
- Well, it's been 15 years.
- How long have you been on it?

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.920
Three days.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:44.020
That's not actually why I called you.

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:45.651
Why did you call me?

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.424
The soup of the day is cream of tomato.

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:50.663
Thank you.

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:58.173
You know, I wasn't being entirely honest
with you the other day.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.468
I know.

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:02.841
- How do you know?
- I'm a cop. I'm good at what I do.

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.202
The truth is?

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:08.216
The truth is, my mom and I...

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:14.017
I hadn't spoken to her for years. I...

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:19.250
I was 3,000 miles away when I heard about
Rebecca and the stroke.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:23.261
I was just a kid.
I couldn't get along with her.

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:26.361
- I understand.
- You do?

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.769
That's how I got here.

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:33.138
Went 3,000 miles to get away
from someone I loved.

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:36.303
- Was the someone you loved a wife?
- Not anymore.

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.680
You don't like to talk about it.

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:42.238
Actually, I talk too much about it.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.580
Well...

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:52.523
Anyway, when I did find out, I was lost.

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:55.523
So you came home.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.264
You know, I'm from LA.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.734
- Where'd you live?
- Beverly Hills.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.139
Well above my pay grade.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.469
Your mom was in a charity hospital.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:12.810
If I'm not being too nosy,
how do you handle this financially?

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.439
I grew up a lot in LA.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:19.420
I went back to school
and I made some money in real estate.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:25.325
An attractive, educated, full-grown woman
can make a lot of money in Beverly Hills.

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.020
Attractive how?

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:37.497
What do you want to talk about, Jesse?

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.037
Baseball.

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:43.069
- Do you have someone in Paradise?
- I did.

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:47.377
- But you're not seeing anyone now.
- I'm seeing you.

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.549
How about those Sox?

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:03.793
Well...

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:18.345
It's been a long time.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.190
You want me to come back?

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.224
Keep the change.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:40.163
- There won't be any change.
- Well, keep it anyway.

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.372
Good night.

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.606
Good night.

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:29.078
- What did you do?
- I hit somebody in the fist with my face.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:36.487
So, Jesse, is there anything
you need to talk about?

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.190
Did Molly call you or did Rose call you?

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:44.490
- Rose called me. She's...
- Concerned?

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.570
How are you with blood?

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.730
I see blood all the time.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:54.401
It's just usually child blood
rather than big people blood.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:57.843
Doc, you are rapidly spiraling
into pediatrician talk.

01:11:57.913 --> 01:11:58.971
Sorry, Jesse.

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:02.916
I need your expert, grown-up,
medical examiner opinion here.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.043
Okay.

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:06.849
Somebody gets shot.
Do they bleed right away?

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.514
Not necessarily.

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:12.651
- I'm studying at night.
- Good.

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:17.254
So a gunshot victim might not leave
a blood trail at the scene.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.162
Exactly.

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:24.828
- So, did I answer your question?
- Oh, I think I know the answer.

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.801
I just wanted to be sure you did.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:30.603
- I want you out of my town.
- Your town?

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:33.477
- That's right.
- What are you, the Sheriff?

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:37.076
- But, Chief Stone...
- Hey, I'm just here for field training.

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:39.677
I'm missing some personal property.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:43.586
- Did you misplace the item or items?
- I think it was stolen.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.685
I see. A theft.

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:49.789
Well, during your abbreviated stay
in Paradise, we aim to protect and serve.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:52.800
So, just what are you missing,
Mr. Pendleton?

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:59.130
- Perhaps I did misplace the items.
- How's tomorrow?

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.836
- How's after the race?
- How's tomorrow?

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:08.446
- Oh, well.
- Mr. Pendleton?

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:11.281
- Yes?
- Shame on you.

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:18.852
- How did I do?
- Officially, I'm shocked.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:21.225
- Unofficially?
- I'm proud of you.

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:25.162
- What would you have done, Jesse?
- I would have slugged him.

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:33.505
- Skipper, what happened?
- I fell.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.539
- Where's Rose?
- Orthodontist.

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:37.340
- Where's Suit?
- Market.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:40.610
He said to let you know
that Captain Healy called.

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:45.283
Hey, Skipper, do you think
I could have the day off tomorrow?

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.356
Are Gino Fish and his receptionist an item?

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.261
- You got a problem with that?
- Hey, I'm just accumulating data.

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:06.205
- Your in-laws still visiting?
- That's what they call it.

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:10.535
- What did you find out about Terry Genest?
- Well, he prefers Terence.

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:13.445
He just got out of prison. Freelance gunsel.

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:15.847
Works for Gino on occasion.

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:18.079
A bit of a loose cannon. Cokehead.

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:21.645
- You'd better be a little careful.
- Everybody says that.

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:25.818
The material on the robber's clothes
was blood.

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:29.729
Now, we're not going to get much more out
of them. It was pretty degraded.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:33.791
Oh, and I also ran that check
that Suitcase said you wanted.

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:36.030
- And?
- Dead end.

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:41.733
There were no accidental gunshot wounds
in May '92.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:44.711
I also checked New Hampshire
and Rhode Island.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:46.680
- You're thorough.
- I am.

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:50.877
And I don't know
what this other thing's about.

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.418
Is he okay?

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:56.988
He's not quite in the same pond with
the other ducks yet. What other thing?

01:14:57.059 --> 01:15:02.998
Well, he wanted me to run a background
check on LA resident, Leeann Lewis.

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.468
- Because?
- He said he had a feeling.

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:11.036
He's been having a lot of those.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.242
The only thing we got was
she was reported missing once.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.335
Landlady filed the report.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.709
Well, she left to take care of her mom.

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:22.611
Anyway, went away.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:26.450
And she sent the landlady an apology
and money to pay off the lease.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.355
- And that was May '92.
- You mean '94.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.325
No.

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:35.363
She was reported missing May 23rd, 1992.

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:39.158
That's the same date as the robbery.

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:43.329
Is that important? Jesse?

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:49.872
- Did that report list an occupation?
- Yeah.

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.343
Waitress.

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:57.741
- Where was her residence?
- Inglewood.

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:52.031
Jesse. What happened?

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.668
I fell.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:56.667
You got some coffee?

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:03.417
- Long drive.
- Lot of traffic?

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:07.246
Actually, I had to make sure
I wasn't followed.

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:11.957
Turns out there was a lot of money
in Hasty's bank. Mob money.

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:14.787
And I've been getting the distinct
impression they'd like to have

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:16.763
what's left of it back.

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:18.896
Do you think you were followed?

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:21.026
- I know I wasn't.
- How do you know?

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:23.401
I'm good at what I do, Rebecca.

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:28.565
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:33.136
It's just that you and your sister
look so much alike.

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:34.682
Of course, if Leeann was dressed as a man,

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:37.810
you wouldn't look anything like her,
would you?

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:43.883
I screwed up. I know better.

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:48.123
It's not just men who rob banks.
It's not just men who kill people.

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:58.068
I didn't kill anyone.

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:01.508
You mean you didn't shoot anybody.

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:08.945
Look, it's just a theory so far.
But it's a pretty good theory.

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:13.611
Shouldn't be too hard to prove.
You went to the dentist as a kid.

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:17.952
Dental records. Fingerprints. DNA.
Something will tell us.

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:22.419
And then what?

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:25.295
Then I'll have to arrest you.

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:32.340
Will you give me time to make
arrangements for my mom?

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.234
Yeah, your mom.

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:41.781
How much money you got left?

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.182
Not a lot. Enough to...

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:47.983
Enough to make sure I can take care of her.

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:50.718
When you go to jail, they take it away.

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:55.620
I talked Leeann into it

01:18:56.264 --> 01:19:00.098
when I found out how much money
there was going through that bank.

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.867
We never had anything.

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:08.336
We thought we were going to travel
and do anything we wanted.

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:14.713
It just seemed so easy.
We thought we were so smart.

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:17.174
It was smart.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.559
Unintended consequences.

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:29.760
The bank guard hit what he was aiming at,
didn't he?

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:34.433
Leeann died where we planned
to change our clothes.

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:36.636
So I...

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:42.800
I put my clothes on her and I buried her.

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:56.415
What do you think is going to happen to her
after I take you away?

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:07.662
Oh, what the hell.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:15.465
You won't be hearing from me again.

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:27.722
What was that kiss about?

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:30.816
You.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.251
I'd like to believe that.

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.979
Did you find what you were looking for?

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:55.483
I did. I found the money
Hasty was laundering for you.

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:59.880
- Hasty who?
- Let's not do this again.

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:03.418
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:08.619
If we're going to be pals, we have to find
a way to be more honest with each other.

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:11.429
Not completely honest?

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:14.234
More honest.

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:16.899
- Well...
- You first.

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:23.442
Assuming I were interested
in the whereabouts of this money,

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:25.411
what could you tell me?

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:31.241
A woman robbed the bank and has used up
most of it taking care of her sick mother.

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:42.654
- You don't really expect me to believe that?
- Not really.

01:21:44.699 --> 01:21:47.133
You don't know where the money is.

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:49.902
Not really.

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:55.032
I'll pull off Mr. Genest.

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:58.165
Jesse, it's Rose:

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.730
Where are you?

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.307
Hello?

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.277
Hello?

01:28:35.083 --> 01:28:35.277
5@y3
