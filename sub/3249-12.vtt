Vincent, can you hear me?
Please...

00:13.320 --> 00:15.559
(CRIES OUT)

00:15.640 --> 00:18.479
It's not enough he goes
drinking all round the town,

00:18.560 --> 00:21.199
now the whole neighbourhood
has to listen to his screaming.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.919
He's very ill, Madame Vernet.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.839
Look at this,
even worse than his usual rubbish.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.559
What's it supposed to be?

00:53.920 --> 00:59.639
It was found behind the wall
in an attic in France.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.079
It's genuine...it's a Van Gogh...

01:03.640 --> 01:06.359
Why bring it to me?

01:06.440 --> 01:08.399
Because it's obviously a message...

01:08.480 --> 01:11.079
and you can see who it's for.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.039
Can't say I understand it.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.239
You're not supposed to understand it,
Prime Minister.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.039
You're supposed to deliver it.

(PHONE RINGS)

Cell 426.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.479
The Doctor? Do you mean Dr Song?

01:36.920 --> 01:40.599
Give me that. Seriously, just give it
to me. I'm entitled to phone calls.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.039
Doctor?

01:46.120 --> 01:47.959
No, and neither are you.
Where is he?

01:48.040 --> 01:50.479
You're phoning the time vortex,
it doesn't always work.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.719
But the TARDIS is smart,
she's re-routed the call.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.159
Talk quickly. This connection
will last less than a minute.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.759
Dr Song.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.839
Are you finished with that?

02:10.200 --> 02:11.839
You're new here, aren't you?

02:11.920 --> 02:13.679
First day.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.479
Then I'm very sorry.

(ALARM BLARES)

02:21.800 --> 02:23.319
Stay exactly where you are.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.159
She had the lipstick, the hallucinogenic
lipstick. She tried to use it on me.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.799
Your tricks don't work in here,
Dr Song.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.159
This is the Royal Collection.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.279
And I'm the bloody Queen.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.919
What are you doing here?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.999
It's about the Doctor, Ma'am.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.719
You met him once, didn't you?
I know he came here.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.599
- The Doctor?
- He's in trouble.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.559
I need to find him.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.199
- Then why are you stealing a painting?
- Look at it.

03:32.760 --> 03:37.679
I need to find the Doctor,
and I need to show him this.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.479
Now, word on the belt is,
you're looking for time travel.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.039
Are you selling?

03:56.320 --> 04:00.879
A vortex manipulator, fresh off
the wrist of a handsome Time Agent.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.519
(SIGHS)

04:06.120 --> 04:08.079
I said offthe wrist.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.359
Not cheap, Dr Song.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.039
Have you brought me a pretty toy?

04:18.760 --> 04:23.679
This is a Calisto Pulse. It can disarm
micro-explosives from up to 20 feet.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.039
What kind of micro-explosives?

04:28.080 --> 04:30.559
The kind I just put in your wine.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.119
- Vavoom!
- Va-what?

04:49.200 --> 04:53.359
I can't believe I've never
thought of this before, it's genius.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.159
Right!

04:55.240 --> 04:58.159
Landed, come on.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.239
- Where are we?
- Planet One.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.039
The oldest planet in the universe.
There's a cliff of pure diamond

05:03.120 --> 05:05.519
and, according to legend,
on the cliff there's writing.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.599
Letters 50 feet high, a message
from the dawn of time,

05:09.680 --> 05:12.879
and no-one knows what it says,
cos no-one's ever translated it.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.039
Till today.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.239
- What happens today?
- Us. The TARDIS can translate anything.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.039
All we have to do is open the doors

05:19.120 --> 05:21.999
and read the very first words
in recorded history.

No, pm.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.719
No, AD.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.879
- That's a Roman legion.
- Well, yeah.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.879
The Romans invaded Britain
several times during this period.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.999
Oh, I know.
My favourite topic at school.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.319
"Invasion of the Hot Italians."

06:09.400 --> 06:12.679
Yeah, I did get marked down
for the title.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.119
Hail, Caesar!

06:16.200 --> 06:18.799
- Hi.
- Welcome to Britain.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.559
We are honoured by your presence.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.199
Well, you're only human.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.079
Arise...

06:24.160 --> 06:26.719
Roman person.

06:26.800 --> 06:31.759
- Why does he think you're Caesar?
- Cleopatra will see you now.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.679
Hello, sweetie.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.759
River!

06:43.840 --> 06:45.159
Hi.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.399
You graffitied the oldest
cliff face in the universe.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.799
You wouldn't answer your phone.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.279
- What's this?
- It's a painting.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.279
Your friend Vincent.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.239
One of his final works.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.319
He had visions, didn't he? I thought
you ought to know about this one.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.919
Doctor?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.799
Doctor, what is this?

08:05.120 --> 08:07.919
- Why's it exploding?
- I assume it's some kind of warning.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.719
Something's going to happen
to the TARDIS?

08:09.800 --> 08:13.279
It might not be that literal.
Anyway this is where he wanted you.

08:13.400 --> 08:17.359
- Date and map reference on the door sign.
- Does it have a title?

08:17.440 --> 08:20.159
The Pandorica Opens.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.239
Come on.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.519
Ya!

08:26.880 --> 08:30.359
- The Pandorica? What is it?
- A box. A cage. A prison.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.559
It was built to contain the most
feared thing in all the universe.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.639
It's a fairy tale, a legend.
It can't be real.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.559
If it is real,
it's here and it's opening.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.759
And it's got something to do
with your TARDIS exploding.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.919
Hidden, obviously. Buried for centuries.
You won't find it on a map.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.479
No. But if you buried the most
dangerous thing in the universe,

08:49.560 --> 08:51.719
you'd want to remember
where you put it.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.759
Ya! Come on!

09:11.880 --> 09:13.559
How come it's not new?

09:13.640 --> 09:16.559
Because it's already old.
Been here thousands of years.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.839
No-one knows exactly how long.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.239
OK, this Pandorica thing.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.959
Last time we saw you, you warned us about
it, after we climbed out of Byzantium.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.479
Spoilers!

09:25.560 --> 09:29.239
No, but you told the Doctor you'd see
him again when the Pandorica opens.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.839
Maybe I did. But I haven't yet.

09:30.920 --> 09:35.719
But I will have. Doctor, I'm picking up
fry particles everywhere.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.159
Energy weapons
discharged on this site.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.919
If the Pandorica is here, it contains
the mightiest warrior in history.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.999
Now, half the galaxy would want
a piece of that. Maybe even fight over it.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.999
We need to get down there.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.799
RIVER: Right then...ready.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.639
(BLEEPING)

10:05.720 --> 10:07.479

10:26.840 --> 10:28.359
The underhenge.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.399
(ELECTRIC FIZZLING)

11:45.880 --> 11:50.519
- It's a Pandorica.
- More than just a fairy tale.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.999
(CRUNCHING)

12:26.800 --> 12:29.279
There was a goblin.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.199
Or a trickster,

12:31.280 --> 12:33.639
or a warrior.

12:33.720 --> 12:39.799
A nameless, terrible thing, soaked
in the blood of a billion galaxies.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.479
The most feared being
in all the cosmos.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.479
And nothing could
stop it, or hold it,

12:47.560 --> 12:50.319
or reason with it.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.399
One day it would just drop out of
the sky and tear down your world.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.039
- How did it end up in there?
- You know fairy tales.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.239
A good wizard tricked it.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.479
I hate good wizards in fairy tales.
They always turn out to be him.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.999
So it's kind of like
Pandora's Box, then?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.239
Almost the same name.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.999
- Sorry, what?
- The story.

13:13.080 --> 13:17.839
Pandora's Box, with all
the worst things in the world in it.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.839
That was my favourite book
when I was a kid.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.679
- What's wrong?
- Your favourite school topic,

13:25.760 --> 13:28.279
your favourite story.
Never ignore a coincidence,

13:28.360 --> 13:31.159
unless you're busy. In which case,
always ignore a coincidence.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.879
- So can you open it?
- Easily. Anyone can break into a prison.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.399
But I'd rather know
what I'm going to find first.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.159
You won't have long to wait.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.839
It's already opening.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.799
There are layers and layers
of security protocols in there,

13:43.880 --> 13:46.479
and they're being disabled, one by one.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.239
Like it's being unlocked

13:48.320 --> 13:50.839
- from the inside.
- How long do we have?

13:50.920 --> 13:53.839
- Hours at the most.
- What kind of security?

13:53.920 --> 13:57.119
Everything.
Deadlocks, time-stops, matter-lines.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.959
- What could need all that?
- What could get past all that?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.439
Think of the fear
that went into making this box.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.839
What could inspire
that level of fear?

14:07.920 --> 14:10.279
Hello, you...

14:10.360 --> 14:13.319
Have we met?

14:13.400 --> 14:14.959
(BEEPING)

14:15.040 --> 14:17.639
- So why would it start to open now?
- No idea.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.679
And how could Vincent have known about
it? He won't even be born for centuries.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.239
The stones! These stones
are great big transmitters,

14:26.320 --> 14:29.839
broadcasting a warning to everyone,
everywhere, to every time zone.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.039
- The Pandorica is opening!
- RIVER: Doctor - everyone, everywhere?

14:33.120 --> 14:35.079
Even poor Vincent heard it
in his dreams.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.439
But what's in there,
what could justify all this?

14:37.520 --> 14:38.599
Doctor, everyone?

14:38.680 --> 14:40.999
Anything that powerful,
I'd know about it. Why don't I know?

14:41.080 --> 14:44.719
Doctor, you said everyone could
hear it. So who else is coming?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.679
Oh.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.199
Oh? Oh, what?

14:56.400 --> 15:00.279
OK, if it is basically a transmitter,
we should be able to fold back the signal.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.999
- Doing it.
- Doing what?

15:02.120 --> 15:06.999
Stonehenge is transmitting, it's been
transmitting for a while...so who heard?

15:07.120 --> 15:10.959
OK, should be feeding back to you now.
River, what's out there? Getting anything?

15:11.040 --> 15:13.159
- Give me a moment.
- River, quickly, anything?

15:15.880 --> 15:20.599
Around this planet,
there are at least 1 0,000 starships.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.759
(SCOFFS) At least?

15:22.880 --> 15:26.439
1 0,000, 1 00,000, 1 million, I don't know.
There's too many readings.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.919
What kind of starships?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.639
- (CROAKY VOICES) Maintaining orbit.
- I obey.

15:31.760 --> 15:36.799
- Shield cover compromised on ion sectors.
- Daleks. Those are Daleks.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.119
- Scan detects no temporal activity.
- Soft grid scan commencing.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.279
Reverse thrust
for compensatory stabilisation.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.319
Daleks, Doctor.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.999
Launch preliminary armaments protocol.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.879
Yes, OK. OK, OK, OK. Dalek fleet.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.959
Minimum, 1 2,000 battleships,
armed to the teeth.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.799
Ahhh! But we've got surprise on our side!

15:55.880 --> 15:59.279
They'll never expect three people
to attack 1 2,000 Dalek battleships.

15:59.360 --> 16:03.399
Cos we'd be killed instantly.
So it would be a fairly short surprise.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.799
- Forget surprise.
- Doctor, Cyber-ships.

16:05.880 --> 16:09.119
No, Dalek ships, listen to them,
those are Dalek ships.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.559
Yes. Dalek ships andCyberships.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.479
Well, we need to start a fight,
turn them on each other. That's easy.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.439
- It's the Daleks - they're so cross...
- Sontaran. Four battle fleets.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.519
Sontarans! Talk about cross,
who stole all their handbags?

16:20.600 --> 16:23.919
Terileptil. Slitheen.
Chelonian. Nestene. Drahvin.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.519
Sycorax. Haemo-goth.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.799
Zygon. Atraxi. Draconian.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.399
They're all here. For the Pandorica.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.999
What are you?

16:33.080 --> 16:34.879
What could you possibly be?

16:50.920 --> 16:54.879
(WHIRRING AND THRUMMING)

16:54.960 --> 16:56.439
What do we do?

16:56.480 --> 17:00.319
Doctor, listen to me! Everything that
ever hated you is coming here tonight.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.119
You can't win this.
You can't even fight it.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.839
Doctor, this once, just this one time,
please, you have to run.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.439
- Run where?
- Fight how?

17:14.880 --> 17:18.439
The greatest military machine
in the history of the universe.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.439
- What is?
- The Daleks?

17:20.520 --> 17:22.319
No. No, no, no, no.

(MAN SHOUTS ORDERS IN BACKGROUND)

17:43.040 --> 17:47.599
So...I return to my command
after one week and discover

17:47.680 --> 17:49.879
we've been playing host to Cleopatra.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.639
- Who's in Egypt. And dead!
- Yes.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.439
Funny how things work out.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.679
- (WHIRRING)
- (WHINNYING)

18:00.800 --> 18:04.799
The sky is falling, and you make jokes.
Who are you?

18:04.880 --> 18:07.919
When you fight Barbarians,
what must they think of you?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.639
Oh, riddles now?

18:09.720 --> 18:12.359
Where do they think you come from?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.799
A place more deadly and more powerful

18:14.880 --> 18:18.399
and more impatient
than their tiny minds can imagine.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.759
Where do I come from?

18:23.840 --> 18:25.719
Your world has visitors.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.159
- You're all Barbarians now.
- What is that?

18:29.240 --> 18:31.759
Tell me, what?

18:31.840 --> 18:33.559
A fool would say,
the work of the Gods.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.199
But you've been a soldier too long to
believe there are Gods watching over us.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.439
There is, however, a man.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.559
And tonight he's going to need
your help.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.039
MAN: Sir?

18:46.880 --> 18:48.239
One moment.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.999
(WHISPERED DIALOGUE)

19:01.360 --> 19:05.479
Well, it seems you have a volunteer.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.239
- What's this got to do with the TARDIS?
- Nothing, as far as I know.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.959
But Vincent's painting - the TARDIS was
exploding, is that going to happen?

19:18.040 --> 19:21.679
One problem at a time. There's
force-field technology inside this box.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.279
If I can enhance the signal,
I could extend it all over Stonehenge.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.799
- Could buy us half an hour.
- What good is half an hour?

19:27.880 --> 19:30.199
There are fruit flies
live on Hoppledom 6

19:30.280 --> 19:33.079
that live for 20 minutes
and they don't even mate for life.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.919
There was going to be a point
to that. I'll get back to you.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.799
So...

19:44.880 --> 19:46.479
are you proposing to someone?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.799
I'm sorry?

19:48.880 --> 19:51.199
I found this in your pocket.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.039
No. No, no, that's, er...

19:55.120 --> 19:56.959
a memory.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.959
A friend of mine, someone I lost.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.239
Do you...mind?

20:03.480 --> 20:05.039
It's weird, I feel...

20:06.600 --> 20:08.399
I don't know. Something.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.959
People fall out of the world sometimes,
but they always leave traces.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.159
Little things
we can't quite account for.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.799

half-eaten meals...

20:25.480 --> 20:28.039
Nothing is ever forgotten,
not completely.

20:29.440 --> 20:33.679
And...if something
can be remembered,

20:33.760 --> 20:35.559
it can come back.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.319
So, was she nice, your friend?

20:51.360 --> 20:53.639
Remember that night
you flew away with me?

20:53.720 --> 20:56.199
(CLEARS THROAT) Of course I do.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.439
And you asked me why I was taking you

20:58.520 --> 21:01.559
and I told you there wasn't a reason.
I was lying.

21:01.640 --> 21:05.079
- What, so you did have a reason?
- Your house.

21:05.200 --> 21:09.079
- (SCOFFS) My house.
- It was too big, too many empty rooms.

21:11.480 --> 21:15.639
Does it ever bother you, Amy,
that your life doesn't make any sense?

21:17.720 --> 21:19.319
(ELECTRONIC ZAPS)

21:21.800 --> 21:23.399
- What was that?
- OK, I need a proper look.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.319
- Got to draw its fire, give it a target.
- How?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.039
You know how sometimes
I have really brilliant ideas?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.119
- Yes...
- Sorry!

21:28.600 --> 21:30.239
Look at me, I'm a target!

21:31.960 --> 21:34.039
- What is that?
- Cyber arm. Arm of a Cyberman.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.839
- And what's a Cyberman?
- Oh, sort of part man, part robot.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.799
The organic part must have died off
years ago,

21:38.880 --> 21:41.119
now the robot part is looking for,
well...fresh meat.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.039
- What, us?
- Yeah, it's just like being

21:43.120 --> 21:45.319
an organ donor, except you're alive
and sort of...screaming.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.239
I need to get behind it,
could you draw its fire?

21:47.320 --> 21:48.639
Like you did?

21:48.720 --> 21:51.439
You'll be fine if you're quick,
it's only got one arm, literally.

where you are. It could be bluffing.

- DOCTOR: Amy?!

- Where's Amy?
- She's fine, Doctor, just unconscious.

OK... Yes, she's sedated, that's all.

OK, Romans, good, I was just wishing
for Romans, good old River. How many?

50 men up top, volunteers.
What about that thing?

25:30.800 --> 25:32.879
50? Not exactly a legion.

25:32.960 --> 25:36.239
Your friend was very persuasive,
but, er...it's a tough sell.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.559
Yes, I know that, Rory, I'm not
exactly one to miss the obvious.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.599

Probably got himself duffed up by
the locals. Never underestimate a Celt.

- Doctor...
- Hush, Rory, thinking.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.799
Why leave a Cyberman on guard?
Unless it's a Cyberthing in the box.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.439
But why would they lock up
one of their own?

25:56.520 --> 25:59.399

but what, what?

You died and then
you were erased from time.

born at all, you neverexisted.

- What?

33:29.240 --> 33:32.519
But I don't understand.
Why am I here?

33:32.600 --> 33:35.279
Because you are.

33:35.360 --> 33:40.119
The universe is big. It's vast
and complicated and ridiculous,

33:40.200 --> 33:42.359

and we call them miracles,

34:09.440 --> 34:10.919
OK?

Are you OK now?

MAN'S VOICE: Silence will fall.

(BUZZ INCREASES IN INTENSITY

35:07.600 --> 35:11.679
OK, so something's been here.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.239
Amy...

36:04.800 --> 36:07.799
Oh, Doctor, why do I let you out?

36:19.960 --> 36:20.959
(BUZZING STOPS)

and more powerful

36:28.160 --> 36:30.959

than their tiny minds can imagine.

(VOICE ECHOES)

36:38.480 --> 36:40.559
AMY: So it's kind of like
Pandora's box, then?

36:40.640 --> 36:42.919
That was my favourite book
when I was a kid.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.279
(VOICE ECHOES)

36:45.480 --> 36:47.239
(WHISPERS) Oh, no...

37:03.320 --> 37:04.839
Are you OK?

37:04.920 --> 37:06.679
Did the Doctor send you?

37:06.760 --> 37:09.399
I'm fine, he just fusses.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.959
You got a blanket. That's good.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.479
- Who gave you that?
- One of the fellas.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.559
- Which one?
- Just one of them. Does it matter?

37:19.600 --> 37:21.239
No...

37:21.320 --> 37:22.319
No.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.039
Forget him...it.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.679
F-Forget it.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.599
What's your name?

37:28.680 --> 37:31.959
I'm...Rory.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.399
What's wrong?

37:34.480 --> 37:38.239
Nothing. It's just not what you expect
Romans to be called.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.359
What's it short for? Roranicus?

37:41.520 --> 37:42.959
Yeah.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.759
You're crying.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.879
The TARDIS, where is it? Hurry up!

37:57.960 --> 38:01.639
Don't raise your voice,
don't look alarmed, just listen.

38:01.720 --> 38:04.159
- (AMY SOBS)
- Hey, what's wrong?

38:04.240 --> 38:06.759
Nothing. It's like...

38:08.600 --> 38:10.719
It's like I'm happy.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.919
(AMY LAUGHS AND SOBS)

38:15.000 --> 38:16.319
Why am I happy?

38:17.320 --> 38:19.159
They're not real, they can't be.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.999
They're all right here
in the story book,

38:22.120 --> 38:25.639
those actual Romans, the ones I sent you,
the ones you're with right now.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.879
They're all in a book in Amy's house,
a children's picture book.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.519
What are you even doing there?

38:30.600 --> 38:32.279
It doesn't matter. The TARDIS went wrong.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.719
Doctor, how is this possible?

38:33.800 --> 38:36.719
Something's using her memories,
Amy's memories.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.319
- But how?
- You said something had been there.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.679
Yes, there's burn marks
on the grass outside,

38:42.760 --> 38:45.359
- landing patterns.
- If they've been to her house,

38:45.440 --> 38:47.399
they could have used her psychic residue.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.479
Structures can hold memories,
that's why houses have ghosts.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.439
They could've taken a snapshot
of Amy's memories. But why?

38:53.520 --> 38:55.759
Doctor, who are those Romans?

38:55.840 --> 38:59.559
Projections or...duplicates.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.359
But they were helping us.
My lipstick even worked.

39:02.440 --> 39:06.999
They might think they're real.
The perfect disguise.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.559
They actually believe
their own cover story...

39:10.640 --> 39:12.999
right until they're activated.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.519
Doctor...

39:16.600 --> 39:18.919
that centurion...

39:20.360 --> 39:22.159
What's the matter?

39:22.240 --> 39:24.119
Nothing.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.479
I don't know why I'm doing that.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.319
It's me.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.279
Amy, please...

39:40.880 --> 39:41.839
It's me.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.119
It's a trap, it has to be.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.879
They used Amy to construct a scenario
you'd believe, to get close to you.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.559
Why? Who'd do that?

39:48.640 --> 39:50.239
What for? It doesn't make sense.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.199
Ahh!

39:51.280 --> 39:54.439
River? River?

39:54.520 --> 39:58.279
- River, what's happening?!
- I don't know, it's the engines.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.039
Doctor, there's something wrong
with the TARDIS,

40:01.120 --> 40:04.599
- like something else is controlling it.
- You're flying it wrong.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.039
I'm flying it perfectly.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.799
You taught me.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.439
Where are you?
What's the date reading?

40:11.520 --> 40:14.559
It's the 26th June, 201 0.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.559
You need to get out of there now!
Any other time zone, just go.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.119
- I can't break free.
- Well, then, shut down the TARDIS.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.239
- Shut down everything!
- I can't!

40:27.040 --> 40:29.719
MAN'SVOICE: Silence will fall!

40:30.760 --> 40:32.999
Silence will fall!

40:35.920 --> 40:40.159
But I don't know you,
I've never seen you before in my life.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.399
- You have. You know you have. It's me.
- Why am I crying?

40:43.480 --> 40:46.159
Because you remember me.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.479
I came back!

40:47.560 --> 40:51.759
You're crying
because you remember me.

40:51.840 --> 40:55.479
Someone else is flying it.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.479
An external force.
I've lost control.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.839
But how? Why?

(HIGH-PITCHED TONE)

41:12.640 --> 41:15.279
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

41:17.880 --> 41:21.959
Listen to me, just land her anywhere.
Emergency landing, now!

41:22.040 --> 41:25.239
There are cracks in time,
I've seen them everywhere,

41:25.320 --> 41:28.479
and they're getting wider. The TARDIS
exploding is what causes them,

41:28.560 --> 41:31.319
but we can stop the cracks
ever happening if you just land her!

41:31.400 --> 41:33.079
It's not safe.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.199
(CLUNKING)

41:43.560 --> 41:45.959
Well, now.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.999
Ready to come out, are we?

41:51.240 --> 41:54.839
Aaargh! No! No, please, no!

41:56.240 --> 41:57.959
I'm not going.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.999
(SHOUTS) I'm Rory!

Doctor...

42:08.240 --> 42:09.679
I'm down.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.439
- I've landed.
- OK, just walk out of the doors.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.919
If there's no-one inside, the TARDIS
engines shut down automatically.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.639
Just get out of there.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.959
- I'm going.
- (SHOUTS) Run!

42:33.080 --> 42:35.279
RORY: Listen to me, you have to run.

42:35.360 --> 42:38.359
You have to get as far away
from here as you can!

I'm a thing. I'll kill you. Just go!

42:40.840 --> 42:43.879

- (WHISPERS) Amy, you've got to run.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.839
I can't hold on, I'm going.

43:03.920 --> 43:08.279
You are Rory Williams and you aren't
going anywhere ever again.

43:08.360 --> 43:11.039

Doctor, please, I've got seconds!

43:13.480 --> 43:15.439
Plastic Romans.

the Nestene Consciousness, eh?

Deep cover, but what for?
What are you doing?

What's coming out?

43:29.720 --> 43:32.239
The Pandorica is ready.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.479
Assessed.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.479
Understood.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.879
Doctor.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.559
The ring. Remember the ring?

43:50.640 --> 43:52.999
You'd never let me wear it
in case I lost it.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.079
- The Doctor gave it to me.
- Show it to me.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.799
Show me the ring.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.919
- Amy...
- Come on!

44:00.000 --> 44:02.199
Just show it to me.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.679
Scanned?

44:14.760 --> 44:17.239
Scanned by what, a box?

Ready for you.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.559
There it is.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.919
You remember.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.639
This is you.

44:49.720 --> 44:51.959

Oh... No!

45:04.640 --> 45:05.719
No!

46:05.120 --> 46:09.359
You lot, working together,

46:09.440 --> 46:11.639
an alliance...

46:11.720 --> 46:13.639
How is that possible?

46:13.720 --> 46:17.959
DALEK: The cracks in the skin
of the universe.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.359
All reality is threatened.

46:20.440 --> 46:23.319
All universes will be deleted.

46:23.400 --> 46:27.919
What?
And you've come to me for help?

46:28.000 --> 46:32.119
No.
We will save the universe from you!

46:32.200 --> 46:33.999
From me?

46:34.080 --> 46:37.679
All projections correlate.
All evidence concurs.

46:37.760 --> 46:40.639
The Doctor will destroy the universe.

46:40.720 --> 46:43.839
No, no, no. You've got it wrong.

46:43.920 --> 46:47.999
The Pandorica was constructed
to ensure the safety of the alliance.

46:48.120 --> 46:54.559
A scenario was devised
from the memories of your companion.

46:54.640 --> 46:56.599
A trap the Doctor could not resist.

46:56.680 --> 47:01.039
DALEK: The cracks in time are the work
of the Doctor. It is confirmed.

47:01.120 --> 47:02.999
No. no, no. Not me, the TARDIS.

47:03.080 --> 47:04.719
And I'm not in the TARDIS, am I?

47:04.800 --> 47:09.239
Only the Doctor can pilot the TARDIS.

47:09.320 --> 47:13.119
- Please, listen to me...
- You will be prevented.

47:13.240 --> 47:17.679
Total event collapse! Every sun will
supernova at every moment in history.

47:17.800 --> 47:23.079
The whole universe will never have
existed! (SHOUTS) Please, listen to me!

47:23.160 --> 47:27.759
- Seal the Pandorica.
- No! Please, listen to me!

47:27.840 --> 47:32.239
The TARDIS is exploding right now
and I'm the only one who can stop it!

47:32.320 --> 47:35.279
(SHOUTS) Listen to me...!
