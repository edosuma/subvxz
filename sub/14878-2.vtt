It's a no-brainer.

I'm late for work,

get the memo.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.904
Well, that's because
you weren't here
three years ago

02:25.979 --> 02:27.503
when they actually did
send out a memo

02:27.580 --> 02:29.548
saying that we were
moving in a week.

We need you to debrief

to our headquarters
claiming to have intel.

We need you
to debrief them in case
any of it is actionable.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.888
Parker in Security
will set you up.

right?

03:16.496 --> 03:17.758

where they lay down
plans for controlling
the world's sugar supply.

that Kennedy was killed
by Lee Harvey Oswald.

of numbers stations?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.338
Short-wave radio
transmissions, right?

04:37.410 --> 04:41.141
Walter told me that
he decoded a message.

04:41.781 --> 04:45.080
How? Numbers stations
are essentially unbreakable.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.280
He's studying
Computer Science
in college.

04:48.354 --> 04:51.118
He used his computer
to help decipher
the message.

04:51.524 --> 04:55.358
Walter said that the clue
led him to a Mail Boxes Etc.
in Rockville,

04:55.428 --> 05:00.058
and he saw a man
take a secret coded message
out of a PO box.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.924
A blue airmail envelope.

05:04.904 --> 05:05.996
Could have just been
the mail.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.404
Look, I know
this sounds crazy,

05:08.975 --> 05:13.810
but Walter claims
that the man saw him.
And now, he's really scared.

05:16.616 --> 05:17.981
What type of code was it?

05:18.051 --> 05:20.144
I... I don't know.

Can you come out to

06:30.123 --> 06:31.181
Yes.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.758
Which of the four
directorates are you in?

06:34.193 --> 06:35.285
That's classified.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.454
Yeah, I figured
you might say that.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.019
What are you reading?

06:39.098 --> 06:43.467
It's a spy novel
called The Parsifal Mosaic.
It's pretty much my favorite.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.436
So, have you come to check
into my numbers station?

06:47.507 --> 06:50.476
I'm going to try.
But I need the specs first.

06:51.511 --> 06:55.208
The numbers station's still
broadcasting new messages
on this bandwidth.

06:55.715 --> 06:56.909
You can listen to them.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.246
Do you have any recordings
of previous broadcasts?

07:02.255 --> 07:05.281
Walter didn't want to bring
his tapes into Langley.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.589
My son is very scared.
He isn't sleeping.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.026
If this turns out to be
nothing, that's good.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.658

would mean a lot.

into this for us?

Really? Is this 1987?

11:59.218 --> 12:02.881
Despite the Belfast Agreement,
the lRA have been
actively recruiting,

who had a hand
in the Bishopsgate

and the attempt
on Vauxhall Cross in '94.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.739

occurred during Lent.

13:02.581 --> 13:05.277
Interactions with foreign
operatives need
to be authenticated.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.983
You didn't think we were
sending you alone, did you?

13:08.287 --> 13:10.687
No. Of course not.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.091
That doesn't look like it
belongs in the new DPD.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.699
That doesn't even
look like it belongs
in the old DPD.

13:24.770 --> 13:27.398
AUGGlE: I assume
you're talking about
the machine and not my vest.

13:28.174 --> 13:31.302
We pulled it
out of the ClA
museum downstairs.

13:31.377 --> 13:35.177
It was used in the '60s
to decipher Russian spy code
during the Cold War.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.878
Whoever's running
this numbers station

13:37.950 --> 13:39.645
is pretty sharp.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.446
Type the word "nuclear"
into an e-mail, and
the NSA is all over it.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.753
But this spy has gone analog
in a digital world.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.726
Aren't there computers
that can handle
this sort of thing?

13:48.794 --> 13:50.455
Yeah. And they are
cranking away

13:50.529 --> 13:52.656
on the most sophisticated
modern codes as we speak.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.126
But Big Bertha here
could come in very handy

13:55.601 --> 13:57.933
if our spy is using
a more archaic sequencing.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.164
Good luck.

14:00.239 --> 14:03.106
No, we don't need luck.
We need Walter's tapes.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.945

we have a long, long history

14:07.012 --> 14:09.173

14:10.616 --> 14:12.106
A moment, please?

14:12.251 --> 14:15.687

introduce you to Teppo Koivu
and Reijo Numenin

14:15.754 --> 14:17.551

14:17.623 --> 14:19.352
Joan Campbell,
head of the DPD.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.985
Pleasure. Arthur,
may I have a word?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.060
I was in a meeting.

14:32.137 --> 14:34.901
Finnish lntelligence?
Are you serious?
Do they even have spies?

14:34.974 --> 14:36.566
Did I miss couples therapy?

14:36.675 --> 14:38.802
Why is Jai Wilcox
now a member of my staff?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.870
I would have thought
you'd want somebody
of his caliber at the DPD.

14:42.081 --> 14:45.380
You know, it's bad enough
you put Annie in the field
to draw out Ben Mercer.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.918
But now, you have
someone spying on her?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.920
No, it's not...
That's not it at all.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.046
Then he's spying on me?

14:50.122 --> 14:51.851
Oh, so,
this is couples therapy.

14:52.491 --> 14:56.587
Joan, with Conrad gone,
Jai is a key part of our
transparency initiative.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.521
Please, trust me.

14:58.998 --> 15:01.193
Next time, a little
heads up would be great.

15:01.467 --> 15:04.436
Transparency between us
would be nice, too.

15:15.781 --> 15:18.875
AGENT: Go to the market, and
follow your protocol exactly.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.476
If it tells you to wear
a polka dot bikini,

15:21.553 --> 15:23.612
wear a polka dot bikini.
And good luck.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.438
Are you interested in honey?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.404
These days,
it's about all I eat.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.677
I could recommend
a good brand.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.113
Could you write it down?
My memory's not quite
what it used to be.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.048
I think we're good.

16:32.024 --> 16:33.321
I should think so.

16:34.293 --> 16:37.126
Nice job. James Elliot.
A real pleasure.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.458

16:38.597 --> 16:40.189
Can you believe the script
in that protocol?

16:40.399 --> 16:42.526
They're always so pedestrian
and food-related, right?

16:42.601 --> 16:45.069
Actually, it's the first one
I've ever done.

16:45.604 --> 16:48.266
Oh, well,
there's the difference
between ClA and Ml6.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.366
You're allowed at your age
and experience
out into the field.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.175
Ml6 is a lovely outfit,
but it's ten years before
you're even allowed

16:55.247 --> 16:57.044
to stretch your legs
outside Vauxhall Cross.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.585

17:02.855 --> 17:05.221
Now, this dinosaur
is outrageous.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.087
It's encryption
through obsolescence.

17:07.826 --> 17:11.421
By the time the ClA
has a technology vetted,
it's already five years old.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.692
It may not look cool,
but it's secure.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.097
Or, maybe

17:15.166 --> 17:17.657

as I thought.

He has a thing
for old spy novels.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.640
Yeah, well, I respect that.

18:39.551 --> 18:42.076
Classic spy novels weren't
about flash and gadgets.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.089
They were more about the...
The human element.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.862
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)

28:21.433 --> 28:24.266
Whoa. That's the one.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.333
Two pieces are in play.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.103
Firstly, we've lD'd
the body of the courier.

28:30.175 --> 28:33.474
He's lRA
and a former associate
of Michael Cahill.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.208
Secondly, we've had reports
that Michael Cahill
is on the move.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.682
Cahill just left Baltimore
on the MARC train
heading to DC.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.849
He'll be arriving
at Union Station
in less than an hour.

28:43.354 --> 28:46.084
JOAN: He has a reputation
for not tolerating mistakes.

28:46.157 --> 28:48.717
We assume he's
coming in to clean up
the courier's mess.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.789
A joint task force
of DHS and Ml6
will detain him there.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.523
That's all for now.

29:04.242 --> 29:05.266
What?

29:05.610 --> 29:08.238
Helen and Walter.
What are we missing?

29:08.980 --> 29:10.709
We've gone down
this road.

29:11.216 --> 29:14.413
The hard drive you took
was corrupted by Walter
before they left.

29:15.019 --> 29:17.010
The cops have come up
with nothing.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.648
We found Helen's car
parked in a long-term lot.

29:19.724 --> 29:21.692
She's turned her
cell phone off.
They're off the grid.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.728
I still think Walter's
tapes are the key.

29:24.229 --> 29:27.221
Annie, in intelligence
gathering, as in life,

29:27.298 --> 29:29.095
we all want
to believe the roles
we play are critical.

29:29.167 --> 29:30.156
But this is
bigger than you now.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.435
ANNlE: What if
this doesn't end with
Cahill and the courier?

29:32.504 --> 29:34.301
What if Helen and Walter
are still in danger?

29:34.372 --> 29:37.569
Are you pushing this
because you think they're
relevant to this case?

29:37.642 --> 29:40.202
Or is it because
you feel bad that
they've gone missing?

29:40.278 --> 29:42.109
Honestly? Both.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.480
Where's the harm
in letting her
follow the thread?

29:49.187 --> 29:50.313
Follow protocol.

29:51.556 --> 29:52.750
And don't get caught.

30:02.433 --> 30:05.630
I can't control whether
or not you've been placed
in my division,

30:05.970 --> 30:10.600
but decisions about
my officers are always mine,
and always final.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.138
I understand.
I'm not sure that you do.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.837
But you will.

30:51.316 --> 30:53.079
AGENT 1: He's
entering the station now.

30:53.151 --> 30:54.140
AGENT 2: We have a visual.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.222
Go.
AGENT 1: It's a go.

31:01.292 --> 31:02.281
AGENT 2: Copy that.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.156
AGENT 1: Mr. Cahill?

31:13.471 --> 31:15.234
Please come with us.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.142
(SlGHS)

31:49.607 --> 31:50.699
FEMALE RECEPTlONlST:
Spruce Knob Cabins.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.134
Hi. I'd like to speak
to one of your guests.

31:53.211 --> 31:55.645
A mother and son
that just checked in.

31:55.947 --> 31:58.040
They said they weren't
taking any calls.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.777
I'm sure they did.

32:05.056 --> 32:07.320
This would go quicker
if you said something.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.484
Seems like
you've filled in most
of the blanks already.

32:10.895 --> 32:13.295
What are you doing
in DC, Mr. Cahill?

32:13.564 --> 32:15.156
I came to see
an old friend.

32:15.233 --> 32:16.427
I'm going to need
a little more than that.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.693
From where I'm sitting,
there are just
too many threads

32:18.770 --> 32:19.998
that lead back to you.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.538
I've told my friends.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.707
I've told my former enemies.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.175
I am a peaceful man.
I've moved on.

32:26.411 --> 32:29.039
And you were either lying
or telling the truth.

32:29.113 --> 32:33.277
And it's your job
to sit here, judge me,
and decide.

32:33.351 --> 32:36.184
No. The truth will emerge.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.452
We can't hide
who we truly are.

32:51.736 --> 32:52.725
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

32:55.673 --> 32:57.470
I had a feeling
you'd find us.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.711
ANNlE: You were right, Walter.

33:00.845 --> 33:04.679
About everything.
The numbers stations,
the dead drops, the spy ring.

33:05.883 --> 33:07.544
We really need your tapes.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.143
They could be important.

33:14.258 --> 33:15.589
Listen to me, Walter.

33:17.061 --> 33:21.327
Every day, the ClA
is deluged with calls

33:21.399 --> 33:27.201
and satellite photos,
transmissions, e-mails,
walk-ins, chatter.

33:28.906 --> 33:32.000
We put you
in the wrong column.
We're sorry.

33:33.811 --> 33:35.176
I'm sorry.

33:36.547 --> 33:40.643
But this isn't a spy novel,
this is real, and your tapes
could make everything better.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.583
I promise you'll be safe.

33:47.625 --> 33:48.853
AUGGlE ON PHONE: Enjoying
the great outdoors?

33:48.926 --> 33:51.622
(LAUGHS) Does the ClA
issue mosquito repellent?

33:51.696 --> 33:53.095
There's a bit of an echo.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.257
This is the only place
I get reception up here.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.399
Fine. Hit it.

33:57.635 --> 33:59.364
Big Bertha's going
to do her thing.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.769
All you have to do
is kick back and
eat some s'mores.

34:03.074 --> 34:07.238
AUTOMATED VOlCE: Four,

34:11.681 --> 34:14.617
AUGGlE: Stu, you've been
riding me all day
about when we can start.

34:14.685 --> 34:15.674
It's show time.

34:16.687 --> 34:17.813
Yeah. Go.

34:19.257 --> 34:23.455
(AUTOMATED VOlCE

34:29.801 --> 34:31.996
ANNlE: What's it like
taking care of Walter?

34:32.070 --> 34:34.094
Hmm. It's wonderful.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.670
He's got a very
active mind, and l...

34:38.376 --> 34:40.036
I just try to be there.

34:40.311 --> 34:41.335
When it comes to
your family,

34:41.411 --> 34:43.072
you do whatever
you have to do.

34:45.449 --> 34:48.112
I mean, sometimes
I think I'm being
overly indulgent.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.716
This time, it turned out
he was onto something.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.583
That's why we reached out
to everybody.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.413
Everybody?

34:54.525 --> 34:56.516
You know, the ClA,
the British Embassy.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.459
You contacted
the British Embassy?

34:59.363 --> 35:02.799
Yeah, last week.
We spoke to their
intelligence officers.

35:05.703 --> 35:07.034
Stay here.

35:14.812 --> 35:15.801
Auggie.

35:15.980 --> 35:17.140
Auggie, are you there?

35:17.215 --> 35:19.080
Stop.
Auggie, are you there?

35:20.284 --> 35:22.844
Annie?
How far did we drill down
on James Elliot?

35:23.054 --> 35:25.648
He claimed Ml6 had no file
on Helen and Walter,

35:25.990 --> 35:29.016
but Helen says they went
over there to share
their intel last week.

35:29.093 --> 35:30.458
Maybe he didn't get the file.

35:30.528 --> 35:34.521
He's on the case.
Reading the file would have
been the first thing he did.

35:35.032 --> 35:39.093
Plus, he's on the nicotine
patch, and he said,
"We're halfway there."

35:40.037 --> 35:41.561
We're 20 days into Lent.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.800
Well, being a Catholic
isn't a crime.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.705
His file says he's Anglican.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.780
I hear you, but that doesn't
mean he's a double agent.
We need something concrete.

35:51.916 --> 35:53.076
(LAUGHS)

36:06.831 --> 36:09.595
Here's something concrete.
He's tracking my phone.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.658
Annie? Just get out
of there. Go.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.469
He's here.
He's after
Helen and Walter.

36:30.821 --> 36:33.790
They're here.
Search the cabins.

36:33.858 --> 36:34.950
(COCKS GUN)

36:43.234 --> 36:44.826
There's a crawlspace
under the cabin.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.631
We could get to it
from right here.

36:56.514 --> 36:58.709
I had a feeling something
like this would happen.

37:09.927 --> 37:10.916

38:22.333 --> 38:24.824
AUGGlE ON PHONE: Walter's
tapes were the key.
Everything fell into place.

38:24.902 --> 38:28.133
It was a plan for a car bomb
outside a British bank in DC.

38:28.539 --> 38:30.939
And Elliot was a double
for the lRA?

38:31.008 --> 38:34.205
Yes. He set Cahill up.
He was the one
who called him to DC.

38:34.278 --> 38:35.677
Set the courier up
as well.

38:36.013 --> 38:37.071
Why?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.638
Helped build the case
against Cahill,

38:38.716 --> 38:41.150
and built your trust for him
at the same time.

38:41.218 --> 38:43.311
Double agents have
never been known
for their morals.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.246
Thanks. I'll call you back.

39:01.939 --> 39:05.375
What you said about being
a spy and having a family...

39:06.043 --> 39:08.136
Was that part of your cover,
or did you mean it?

39:08.646 --> 39:10.136
That's what you want to know?

39:12.783 --> 39:15.308
(SCOFFS) Does that
even matter now?

39:16.120 --> 39:17.815
It matters to me.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.529
It was true.

39:30.401 --> 39:32.335
It was the only true thing
I told you.

39:49.153 --> 39:53.453
Mr. Cahill, I'm in the
unfortunate position of
having to apologize to you.

39:53.524 --> 39:56.516
Intelligence gathering is not
perfect. We made a mistake.

39:57.027 --> 39:58.255
You're free to go.

39:58.763 --> 40:01.061
I came here looking
for a new life,

40:01.365 --> 40:05.199
but it seems to me
you can't ever escape
the mistakes of your past.

40:05.503 --> 40:08.438
So look forward.
It's all any of us can do.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.336
ARTHUR: So, tell me
about Annie Walker.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.348
She's smart. Intuitive.

40:19.016 --> 40:20.745
Well, the fact
that Ben Mercer has
gone underground

40:20.818 --> 40:23.116
means anything she can
provide will be critical.

40:23.187 --> 40:24.882
I want you to continue
to get close to her.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.078
How close?

40:26.257 --> 40:27.849
As close as you need to.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.858
Joan isn't exactly happy
about this situation.

40:32.196 --> 40:34.357
You let me worry about Joan.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.066
Walter, thanks again
for all your help.

everything you've done
for him.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.423
I do, too.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.193
Thank you.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.444
You're an amazing aunt.

41:26.517 --> 41:28.178
The girls love you
more than anything.

41:28.619 --> 41:31.986

of paper to prove
that you'd be there for them.

to do.

through the whole speech.
