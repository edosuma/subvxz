00:07.200 --> 00:10.033
Stella: Aww!
Look at these two.

00:10.070 --> 00:15.031
She's been dreaming about this
day since she was a sapling.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.209
He's got a tiny stick
up his butt.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.777
But you can't deny they
were made for each other.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.242
Stella?

00:23.290 --> 00:24.815
Hmm?
Who are you talking to?

00:24.850 --> 00:26.181
Oh.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.187
Thought
I was talking to you.

00:27.220 --> 00:30.190
Oh, let me guess.
You two need a wedding cake.

00:30.230 --> 00:34.224
Actually, we need
a funeral cake.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.557
That's not a thing.
Right.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.298
But I love cake,
and it's my funeral.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.434
My living funeral.

00:41.470 --> 00:42.801
I'm dying.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.639
Wow. I'm so sorry.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.671
Oh, no, don't be.

00:46.710 --> 00:49.441
My life has been
pretty amazing.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.575
I can honestly say
I wouldn't change a thing.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.645
Stella: From the minute I was
diagnosed with cancer,

00:54.680 --> 00:57.149
my mom and dad were there
for me no matter what.

00:57.190 --> 01:00.251
We're here for you.
No matter what.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.280
* I've been thinking

01:01.320 --> 01:03.220
Over the next few years,

01:03.260 --> 01:08.221
my brother Aiden encouraged me
to live like I was dying.

01:08.260 --> 01:10.160
* Just waiting

01:10.200 --> 01:11.759
Because I was.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.461
Yeah!

01:13.500 --> 01:17.835
My sister Elizabeth
never let me miss a beat...

01:17.870 --> 01:21.170
even when I was
at my absolute worst.

01:21.210 --> 01:24.145
<i>* Xk</i>

01:24.180 --> 01:28.447
My family always
helped me face my fears.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.541
So that dying would seem
like the next great adventure.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.554
Woman: Would you do something
for me?

01:35.590 --> 01:38.252
Six years in, I thought
I had done it all.

01:38.290 --> 01:40.156
Would you get me
out of here?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.464
But then I was watching
this sappy cancer movie

01:42.500 --> 01:44.798
with my sister
and her husband, Diego,

01:44.830 --> 01:46.832
and I realized that there
was still one thing

01:46.870 --> 01:48.338
left for me to do --

01:48.370 --> 01:50.862
find true love.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.036
So after I stopped chemo,

01:52.070 --> 01:55.176
my dad scraped together
the money to send me

01:55.210 --> 01:57.178
to the birthplace of love --

01:57.210 --> 01:58.177
Paris.

01:58.210 --> 02:01.316
* Waiting on a song

02:01.350 --> 02:07.483
<i>* Xk</i>

02:07.520 --> 02:09.750
Where I dressed up
like a sexy mime

02:09.789 --> 02:13.829
and waited for my soul mate
to appear.

02:13.860 --> 02:16.192
Both: Oh! I'm so sorry.

02:16.230 --> 02:18.392
He was lost -- literally.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.693
Can you help me?

02:19.740 --> 02:22.334
But he was also
figuratively lost.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.634
See, he was
afraid to live...

02:24.670 --> 02:26.604
Wes:
And she was afraid to die.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.177
Oh, baby, you've gotta
stop adding that part.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.304
I was not afraid to die.

02:31.350 --> 02:32.545
We'll just tell it
your way.

02:32.580 --> 02:36.642
So there we were,
two strangers in Paris...

02:36.690 --> 02:38.579
falling in love the way
only two people

02:38.620 --> 02:41.351
with nothing else
to do truly can.

02:41.390 --> 02:46.954
<i>* Xk</i>

02:47.000 --> 02:52.530
<i>* Xk</i>

02:52.570 --> 02:54.789
* Running through the heat,
heartbeat *

02:54.840 --> 02:58.333
* You shine like silver
in the sunlight *

02:58.370 --> 03:00.702
* You light up my whole heart

03:00.740 --> 03:03.209
* It feels like in the sun

03:03.250 --> 03:05.571
You know what happens next.

03:05.610 --> 03:11.811
* Love like this
won't last forever *

03:11.850 --> 03:18.381
* T know that love like this
won't last forever *

03:18.430 --> 03:21.730
* But I --
I don't really mind *

03:21.760 --> 03:24.730
<i>* Xk</i>

03:24.770 --> 03:26.568
Stella?

03:26.600 --> 03:29.638
Will you spend
the rest of your life...

03:29.670 --> 03:32.310
with me?

03:32.340 --> 03:33.273
I love you.

03:33.310 --> 03:35.870
I love you, too.

03:35.910 --> 03:39.369
* Forever, but I

03:39.420 --> 03:40.512
* Yeah

03:40.550 --> 03:43.588
So I got my godmother Poppy
to marry us.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.588
Sure, getting married
was a rash decision,

03:45.620 --> 03:48.453
but it was only a six-
to eight-month commitment tops.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.584
-I love you.
-Not yet!

03:50.630 --> 03:54.453
"Husband and wife,"
I have to say that part.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.266
And so began
the sexiest marriage ever.

03:58.300 --> 04:01.270
* You

04:01.300 --> 04:02.529
I know what you're thinking.

04:02.570 --> 04:05.835
Nobody has Sara Bareilles
candle sex every night.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.338
But we do.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.734
Because we never know

04:08.780 --> 04:11.772
if it will be my
last night on earth.

04:11.810 --> 04:14.745
That was a beautiful story.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.418
A little longer
than I expected,

04:16.450 --> 04:19.010
but...a beautiful story.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.782
You're life is like one of
those romantic cancer movies.

04:22.830 --> 04:27.028
I want to give you
a free cake.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.290
Thank you so much.

04:29.330 --> 04:31.697
Okay.
I played the cancer card,

04:31.730 --> 04:34.438
but you have to play
the hand you're dealt.

04:34.470 --> 04:37.804
After all, I am dying.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.069
You're not dying.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.602
I'm sorry.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.472
What did you just say?

04:43.510 --> 04:45.877
The oncolytic
virotherapy worked.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.912
Stella...

04:47.950 --> 04:49.349
you're cured.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.882
Oh, my God!
That's amazing!

04:51.920 --> 04:53.786
That's amazing!
Thank you so much!

04:53.820 --> 04:57.427
* Your yelling's
getting loud *

04:57.460 --> 04:59.394
* Keep it down now

04:59.430 --> 05:02.422
* Keep it down now

05:02.470 --> 05:06.338
* There's talk going
'round this town *

05:06.370 --> 05:07.895
* Keep it down now

05:07.940 --> 05:09.806
Needless to say,
my living funeral

05:09.840 --> 05:11.569
took on a whole new meaning.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.738
* Noises closing in
from all sides *

05:13.780 --> 05:15.703
* Warning all the ways to die

05:15.740 --> 05:17.071
Stella:
I know that we've been

05:17.110 --> 05:19.909
down this road before...

05:19.950 --> 05:23.887
Dr. Chang said that
I'm not in remission...

05:23.920 --> 05:26.480
I'm cured.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.385
Man:
I don't believe it.

05:28.420 --> 05:36.420
<i>* Xk</i>

05:36.630 --> 05:39.497
Oh, Daddy, stop crying.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.894
You're making me cry.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.430
Your mom's
not gonna stop.

05:42.470 --> 05:45.508
I'm so glad
you're okay.

05:45.540 --> 05:46.905
Thank you.

05:46.940 --> 05:47.873
Who are you?

05:47.910 --> 05:49.446
Oh, I'm Aiden's friend
Marlene.

05:49.480 --> 05:53.110
She's here for
emotional support.

05:53.150 --> 05:56.074
<i>* Xk</i>

05:56.120 --> 05:59.488
* C'est la vie *

05:59.520 --> 06:01.557
We got rowdy that night.

06:01.590 --> 06:03.649
Even Dad danced.

06:03.690 --> 06:06.728
* C'est la vie *

06:06.760 --> 06:11.061
* It's unforgettable

06:11.100 --> 06:12.932
<i>* Xk</i>

06:12.970 --> 06:14.438
Diego:
All right, hey, guys!

06:14.470 --> 06:16.404
Why are we still
holding these eulogies

06:16.440 --> 06:17.339
for someone
who's not dying?

06:17.370 --> 06:19.429
Why don't we just
burn this thing, huh?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.606
Who's with me?
Come on!

06:20.640 --> 06:24.008
This thing is not lighting.
Okay, just give me a second.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.417
All right, okay.
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.976
Okay.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.614
Oh, Stel, you should have
invited Dr. Chang

06:31.650 --> 06:32.879
so we could have
thanked her in person.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.879
Mmm. Oh, this
was just for family.

06:36.930 --> 06:40.560
And apparently, Marlene.
-Aww!

06:40.600 --> 06:41.556
Plus, I was thinking
that I could --

06:41.600 --> 06:43.796
I could throw Dr. Chang
her own party next week

06:43.830 --> 06:47.539
instead of family dinner.
Of course, yes!

06:47.570 --> 06:48.765
So...
what are you gonna do

06:48.800 --> 06:50.939
with the first day of
the rest of your life?

06:50.970 --> 06:53.871
I don't know.
Maybe I'll apply to college.

06:53.910 --> 06:58.541
I know a professor who could
write me a good recommendation.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.618
Everything okay, Daddy?

07:01.650 --> 07:04.813
Yep. Never been better,
Stel-belle.

07:04.850 --> 07:11.654
<i>* Xk</i>

07:11.690 --> 07:13.522
Hey, did my dad
seem weird to you?

07:13.560 --> 07:16.621
No, you're dad's
just not a very emotional guy.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.640
Yeah.
It's probably nothing.

07:19.670 --> 07:23.561
Okay, time for our
private celebration.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.534
Play Sara Bareilles.

07:28.580 --> 07:32.642
MmMmm.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.547
Mmm. Actually...
Mm

07:35.580 --> 07:37.241
Um...

07:37.290 --> 07:41.659
would you mind
if we took the night off?

07:41.690 --> 07:43.727
I'm -- I'm exhausted, and-- Yes.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.491
Absolutely fine.
No problem.

07:46.530 --> 07:47.929
Okay. I'm sorry.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.225
Today's just...
been a lot.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.692
And I...

07:52.740 --> 07:53.969
don't want
to be up for hours.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.490
Babe, it doesn't
have to take hours.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.510
I mean, maybe we can just
ditch the 600 candles

07:58.540 --> 07:59.302
and the indie-rock
soundtrack

07:59.340 --> 08:02.139
and, you know,
just get 'er done.

08:02.180 --> 08:03.579
Oh. Ow.

08:03.610 --> 08:06.648
Am I the "er" in
that crude proposition?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.739
Oh, no. I mean, yes,
you are, but I--

08:08.780 --> 08:10.043
Do you not like
the way we have sex?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.910
I love it. It's not that,
I'm just saying

08:11.950 --> 08:14.612
that this isn't gonna be
your last night on earth,

08:14.660 --> 08:17.527
so maybe
we could change it up.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.699
I don't want anything
to change.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.919
You know what? Never mind.
Let's just go to bed.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.938
What are you doing?

08:31.970 --> 08:34.530
I always fall asleep
with my head on your chest.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.140
Unless you don't like being
my pillow anymore, either.

08:38.179 --> 08:41.548
No, I --I love
being your pillow.

08:41.580 --> 08:44.015
Get in there.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.449
Yeah.

08:47.490 --> 08:51.586
As I lay there, I could feel
things were already changing,

08:51.630 --> 08:53.758
I just didn't know how much.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.723
What?
-Hi, Daddy.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.094
Oh. Just came to see
how you were doing.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.861
Can't talk, Stel-belle,
late for my lecture.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.962
-Oh.
-Rent's on the counter.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.671
Love you.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.543
What's going on?

09:12.750 --> 09:15.173
Mom just left Dad.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.752
Do you --
Do you want a waffle?

09:24.730 --> 09:26.596
Aiden:
These waffles are amazing.

09:26.630 --> 09:28.098
You should try it.

09:28.130 --> 09:29.894
Can you just stop
with the waffle?

09:29.930 --> 09:31.864
You're right, this is serious.
A waffle isn't the answer.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.834
Oh, I also have three flavors
of Tasty Strudel--

09:33.870 --> 09:37.261
Will someone just
tell me what happened?

09:37.310 --> 09:39.267
Lizzie, you take it.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.937
Oh, okay.

09:40.980 --> 09:45.702
The way Mom and Dad
act around you is a show.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.013
They've got problems.

09:47.050 --> 09:48.814
They just
kept them from you

09:48.850 --> 09:50.944
because Dr. Chang
told us not to dump in,

09:50.990 --> 09:53.960
because creating a positive
emotional environment

09:53.990 --> 09:56.789
would give you a better shot
at beating cancer.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.719
So...

09:58.760 --> 10:01.320
we all kept stuff
from you.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.021
You all have...

10:03.070 --> 10:05.892
secrets you've been hiding from
me for the last eight years?

10:05.930 --> 10:07.637
Oh, uh...
-No, no secrets.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.092
I'm good.

10:09.140 --> 10:10.630
Are you lying?

10:10.670 --> 10:13.708
Obviously.
Aiden is stress-eating.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.834
So what are you're problems?

10:15.880 --> 10:19.100
Uh, Aiden is a grown man
who still lives at home,

10:19.150 --> 10:21.710
sells his ADD medication
to soccer moms,

10:21.750 --> 10:25.118
and uses your cancer to guilt
them into sleeping with him.

10:25.150 --> 10:28.711
Well, Elizabeth hates
her children. I do not!

10:28.760 --> 10:31.650
Please, you said that you would
trade them for a massage chair.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.124
I said that once.

10:33.160 --> 10:36.152
Okay, okay.
I will admit I...

10:36.200 --> 10:37.725
made sacrifices
in my career

10:37.770 --> 10:39.864
so that I could have
children early

10:39.900 --> 10:43.666
to give Mom and Dad
something positive to focus on.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.337
And I may regret that.

10:45.370 --> 10:48.908
And I may regret selling drugs
and sleeping with soccer moms.

10:48.940 --> 10:52.342
-No! It's so fun!

10:52.380 --> 10:55.111
Guys,
I do what I have to.

10:55.150 --> 10:57.016
Dad gives handouts
to his dying daughter,

10:57.050 --> 10:58.916
but all he gives
his loser son is grief.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.681
And a place to live.
Reluctantly.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.926
He gives that
reluctantly.

11:02.960 --> 11:07.158
Okay, you...
might be beyond help.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.827
But, Lizzie...

11:08.860 --> 11:12.421
if you need to focus on work,
I can babysit.

11:12.470 --> 11:14.734
You know nothing about
kids. That's not true.

11:14.770 --> 11:15.760
I know a lot.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.837
I believe...

11:17.870 --> 11:19.975
the children are our future.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.739
That sounds about right.

11:21.780 --> 11:24.408
I do have a stupid client
dinner tomorrow night and--

11:24.450 --> 11:27.044
Done!
Oh.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.741
I probably should
have run that by Wes,

11:28.780 --> 11:30.919
but I figured
he'd be cool with it.

11:30.950 --> 11:32.759
He loves to make me happy.

11:32.790 --> 11:33.985
I mean,
the past six months,

11:34.020 --> 11:36.318
I did whatever it took
to make her happy,

11:36.360 --> 11:38.749
even when it didn't
always make me happy.

11:38.790 --> 11:39.791
Now I'm starting to worry

11:39.830 --> 11:42.356
if I can keep it up
for the rest of our lives.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.822
Uh, you see, Wes,

11:43.870 --> 11:45.895
this is a support group

11:45.930 --> 11:48.490
for the spouses
of the terminally ill,

11:48.540 --> 11:50.201
which you no longer are.

11:50.240 --> 11:55.235
That's why we ordered you
this celebratory pizza.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.409
Ah, you guy!
You're the best.

11:58.450 --> 12:00.873
Just before we dig into it,
though, can I ask you--

12:00.920 --> 12:02.069
No. No.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.750
Wes, this pizza is a...

12:05.790 --> 12:07.781
it's a gesture of...

12:07.820 --> 12:09.822
good-bye.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.955
It's a good-bye pizza.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.128
Yeah. Let's eat.

12:15.160 --> 12:19.290
<i>* Xk</i>

12:19.330 --> 12:21.094
I knew that my dad
wasn't the type of guy

12:21.140 --> 12:23.768
that was gonna tell me
what was going on,

12:23.810 --> 12:25.437
so I went to him.

12:25.470 --> 12:31.500
<i>* Xk</i>

12:31.550 --> 12:34.019
Hey, Daddy.
Stel-belle.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.178
What are you doing here?

12:36.220 --> 12:38.882
Can we talk about
you and Mom?

12:38.920 --> 12:40.911
We're fine.
She left you.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.180
We've been better.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.551
I know
you want to protect me.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.490
Lizzie told me about
the whole dumping in thing

12:48.530 --> 12:50.919
while Aiden claimed you
thought he was a loser.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.426
He is a loser.

12:52.470 --> 12:55.496
He spent an entire week hiding
our garden gnomes in places

12:55.540 --> 12:58.510
that would scare me
in the dark.

12:58.540 --> 12:59.939
That's...

12:59.980 --> 13:01.129
not funny.

13:02.910 --> 13:06.813
Dad, you don't have to
protect me anymore.

13:06.850 --> 13:09.945
Just tell me what happened.
Why did Mom leave?

13:09.990 --> 13:12.140
She's just staying
at Poppy's for a while

13:12.190 --> 13:16.013
while she processes
the fact...

13:16.060 --> 13:18.449
we may have to
sell the house.

13:18.490 --> 13:19.889
Why?

13:19.930 --> 13:22.126
I can't afford
the mortgage.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.867
Or the second mortgage.

13:23.900 --> 13:27.268
Well, if you were hurting,
why didn't you say something?

13:27.300 --> 13:31.840
You didn't have to pay
for Paris or my wedding.

13:31.870 --> 13:32.837
Or my rent.

13:32.880 --> 13:38.000
No, I don't regret
helping you for one second.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.609
But I should have been
more responsible

13:39.650 --> 13:41.140
with how much I helped.

13:41.180 --> 13:44.013
I should have told
your mother sooner.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.251
For the first time
in my life,

13:47.290 --> 13:50.123
my dad needed my help
more than I needed his.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.379
Here's what we're gonna do.
I'll talk to Mom,

13:52.430 --> 13:55.593
and you are gonna figure out
how to save the house.

13:55.630 --> 14:00.534
And to help, I am cutting
myself off financially,

14:00.570 --> 14:01.992
starting right now.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.929
Rent check...

14:03.970 --> 14:05.506
What about college?

14:05.540 --> 14:07.008
College is for dorks.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.338
I'm a college professor.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.439
I'll get a job.

14:11.480 --> 14:14.415
So I did the same thing
every desperate Millennial

14:14.450 --> 14:17.988
with a funky haircut does,
I became a barista.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.057
Never show up
without the hat.

14:20.090 --> 14:23.060
Yes! My first job ever!

14:23.090 --> 14:24.888
Was it my dream job?

14:24.930 --> 14:27.126
No. But it was a start.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.889
And now that I was
pulling my own weight,

14:28.930 --> 14:30.523
I thought it would be
a good time for me

14:30.570 --> 14:33.267
to go by my godmother's house
and talk to my mom.

14:33.300 --> 14:40.502
<i>* Xk</i>

14:40.540 --> 14:42.406
I thought wrong.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.247
As I watched
my mother make up

14:47.280 --> 14:49.442
for missing 30 years
of Lilith Fair,

14:49.480 --> 14:52.518
I realized why she loved
her Subaru so much.

14:52.550 --> 14:55.485
I also realize that I knew
lots of lesbian cliches.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.056
What the hell?!

14:57.090 --> 14:59.479
Oh! Oh, my gosh!
What is going on?

14:59.530 --> 15:00.656
Honey, honey, this...

15:00.700 --> 15:02.259
this doesn't mean
what you think it means.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.927
-Oh, I don't know.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.166
I mean, we have -- we should
talk about this. Maybe later?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.237
Yeah, this is between
you and your mom.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.409
I will be inside. If you
need me-- She doesn't.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.205
She's married to my dad...
who you know.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.004
-I should go.
-Yeah.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.530
-Yeah.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.139
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:18.180 --> 15:20.444
Don't attack Poppy.
This isn't her fault.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.141
Okay,
then whose fault is it?

15:22.180 --> 15:23.409
Probably mine.

15:23.450 --> 15:26.090
Wait, so this isn't
about the house?

15:26.120 --> 15:27.258
The hous-- no.

15:27.290 --> 15:30.123
No, your father
lying about money

15:30.160 --> 15:32.629
is just part of
the problem, honey.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.128
He closed himself off.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.424
So you're having
an affair with Poppy?

15:36.460 --> 15:37.268
No.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.029
No, this is
the first time anything

15:39.070 --> 15:40.435
has gotten physical
with us.

15:40.470 --> 15:43.235
Well, second -- third.
Oh.

15:43.270 --> 15:45.432
- Our connection
is mainly emotional.

15:45.470 --> 15:49.100
So you're having
an emotiona affair.

15:49.140 --> 15:50.699
Oh. You're making it
sound so tacky.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.050
Well, it is tacky. You still
have her lip gloss on your chin.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.084
Ew. What?
Oh, God, look, I'm just...

15:57.120 --> 16:00.181
okay, look, I am just trying
to explain that I am --

16:00.220 --> 16:03.190
I'm very confused.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.221
Look, honey...

16:05.260 --> 16:07.524
I have always put
our family first.

16:07.560 --> 16:11.190
But now it's my turn to start
thinking about my needs.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.198
You have to talk to Dad.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.289
And give him a chance
to fix this.

16:16.340 --> 16:19.469
I do. I will.
I will talk to him, I promise.

16:19.510 --> 16:23.003
But until I do, can we please
keep this between the two of us?

16:23.050 --> 16:24.347
Of course.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.348
But everyone knows telling
the person you're married

16:26.380 --> 16:28.178
to doesn't count.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.086
-Oh.
-Morning.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.588
Good morning.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.009
I still can't believe
about your mum and Poppy.

16:34.060 --> 16:37.360
Oh, it's nothing.
Just having a midlife crisis.

16:37.390 --> 16:40.121
Well,
maybe it's a good thing

16:40.160 --> 16:43.198
that she's taking some time
to sort stuff out, you know?

16:43.230 --> 16:44.391
You can't really have
a happy marriage

16:44.430 --> 16:47.297
without being honest
about who you are.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.092
Whose side are you on?

16:49.140 --> 16:51.632
Your side, babe.
I'm always on your side.

16:51.670 --> 16:53.775
You know, unless
we were on a boat

16:53.810 --> 16:57.041
and being the same side as you
is gonna make the boat tip.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.548
And then I would...

16:58.580 --> 17:00.548
obviously move
to the other side,

17:00.580 --> 17:01.615
for your safety.

17:01.650 --> 17:02.617
But, no, I would --

17:02.650 --> 17:05.186
I would still be on
your side metaphorically.

17:05.220 --> 17:07.051
Okay.

17:07.089 --> 17:08.558
I just feel like
you're acting weird around me

17:08.589 --> 17:11.059
since we found out
I was cured.

17:11.089 --> 17:13.730
Hmm. Uh, no.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.159
No, not doing that.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.170
He was doing that,
but I couldn't deal with it.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.759
I had to go to work,

17:19.800 --> 17:22.234
where I learned a fun
new way to spell "Julie.”

17:22.270 --> 17:26.059
J-O-O-L-I-E.

17:26.109 --> 17:27.180
Adorable.

17:27.210 --> 17:29.429
I'll go get that ready.
-Thank you.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.644
I'm having a lot of difficulty
with these names.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.183
Oh, yeah, I just
draw little pictures.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.312
Hottie incoming.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.579
Ew, that's my brother.
I call dibs.

17:42.620 --> 17:45.783
Yeah, you don't have to,
"cause that's my brother.

17:48.430 --> 17:49.852
Yeah, you brought
her to my funeral.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.822
Oh, my God.
You died?

17:50.870 --> 17:53.168
Okay, can you just go
be dumb over there?

17:53.200 --> 17:54.338
Whatever.

17:54.370 --> 17:55.769
Well, she just
called me to tell me

17:55.800 --> 17:57.438
that her husband was
coming by the house to,

17:57.470 --> 17:59.837
you know, kill me,
so I had to get out of there.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.134
Marlene's married?
Totally.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.602
What is wrong
with our family?

18:03.650 --> 18:07.871
I don't have the time necessary
to answer that question.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.809
Shh, shh, that's him!

18:09.850 --> 18:10.681
Aiden!

18:12.620 --> 18:15.282
Okay, Aiden,
this is crazy.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.186
You cannot be dating
married women.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.720
We're not dating.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.353
Why are you talking to this
man instead of working?

18:20.400 --> 18:23.768
Oh. I -- I don't know
if I'd call him a man.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.667
Ouch.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.135
Do you have a back door?

18:29.170 --> 18:30.308
Okay, uh...

18:30.340 --> 18:31.705
I'll find it.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.733
Sorry.
Back to the grind.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.771
Uh, coffee grind.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.281
No hat, no shift.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.186
Clearly, I was
failing at work.

18:47.220 --> 18:50.258
But I hoped babysitting
Lizzie's kids would go better.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.327
I want to wear
your shiny ring.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.920
No. No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.520
I want it.
Okay.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.197
Ah! Oh!

18:59.230 --> 19:03.337
Frank,
I am your father.

19:03.370 --> 19:05.202
You are?!
No.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.572
No, that's just
from the movie.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.169
Okay?

19:09.210 --> 19:11.201
Wow, I can't believe you've
never seen "Star Wars."

19:11.250 --> 19:13.412
-I'm five.
-Right.

19:13.450 --> 19:16.511
Well, by the time Auntie Stelly
and my kids are five,

19:16.550 --> 19:19.281
they are gonna know
every word.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.857
You said
you didn't want kids.

19:21.890 --> 19:24.222
Did I?

19:24.260 --> 19:29.221
Well, that was because you said
you didn't want kids, you know?

19:29.260 --> 19:31.490
Well, that's an issue.

19:31.530 --> 19:34.761
It's an even bigger issue
that you lied to me.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.939
We should talk about this
later.

19:36.970 --> 19:38.301
Why can't we just talk
about it right now?

19:38.340 --> 19:40.934
Because Fiona
swallowed your ring.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.573
My bad.

19:45.410 --> 19:48.778
So...there's the ring.

19:48.820 --> 19:52.779
And there's what appears
to be a...

19:52.820 --> 19:55.289
small toy car.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.789
Okay. Well, this, too,
shall pass.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.424
Just tell your sister
to keep an eye on her stool.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.326
Okay, I -- I can't ask
my sister to see

20:02.360 --> 20:03.862
if her kid's
crapping diamonds

20:03.900 --> 20:05.368
without an explanation.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.219
Crap's a bad word.

20:06.270 --> 20:10.264
Don't you judge me,
you ate my ring.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.371
You okay?

20:13.410 --> 20:15.777
Yes. Sorry.
I'm just...

20:15.810 --> 20:19.348
just trying to adjust
to a post-cancer world.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.779
Tell me about it.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.312
Thought I'd spend my whole life
trying to find a cure,

20:23.350 --> 20:24.283
but it didn't take
that long.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.620
So now I have no idea
what to do with myself.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.381
I feel like you should
probably keep curing people.

20:31.430 --> 20:34.923
What I meant was my whole life's
been so focused on one thing

20:34.960 --> 20:36.951
that I haven't had time
to do anything else,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.367
like...date.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.298
Oh, my God. Yes!

20:42.340 --> 20:43.705
You should date my brother.

20:43.740 --> 20:46.607
I can't date
my patient's brother.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.472
God, no matter
how sexy he is.

20:48.510 --> 20:51.810
Yeah, but I'm not
your patient anymore.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.319
So, I mean, come on,
what do you have to lose?

20:54.350 --> 20:56.569
My virginity.

20:56.620 --> 20:57.280
Oh.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.390
I'm kidding.

20:58.420 --> 20:59.717
Sort of.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.388
Okay, you're right,
maybe you can set us up

21:01.420 --> 21:02.410
at my thank you party
tomorrow night.

21:02.460 --> 21:05.384
Oh, no! I forgot
all about her party.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.751
Totally.
Yes, that's perfect.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.599
I - I am so excited
for your party.

21:10.630 --> 21:12.564
You know, I even
wrote you a speech.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.568
Nope. No, I didn't.
Why did I say that?

21:14.600 --> 21:18.468
Wes: I'm sorry. Elizabeth: Well, she
was crying. Was anybody watching her?

21:18.510 --> 21:20.478
-She just--

21:20.510 --> 21:22.000
How did you know
we were here?

21:22.040 --> 21:24.042
Wes called me. The question
is why didn't you?

21:24.080 --> 21:28.313
Because I -- I had
the situation under control.

21:28.350 --> 21:30.444
Clearly.
Have they eaten?

21:30.490 --> 21:33.460
I ate fancy jewelry.
Honey.

21:33.490 --> 21:35.959
Okay, you guys,
let's just -- let's go.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.924
Sorry, Lizzie!

21:37.960 --> 21:40.395
Please keep an eye
on her stool!

21:42.930 --> 21:43.965
Nice work, narc.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.459
Wait, so it's not okay
for your family to lie to you,

21:47.500 --> 21:49.093
but fine for you
to lie to them.

21:49.140 --> 21:52.030
Of course not, that's why
I needed you to do it.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.437
Well, I'm sorry, but I thought
Fiona was in danger.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.677
Well, you were wrong.

21:57.710 --> 22:00.873
Stella?

22:00.920 --> 22:02.445
We're parked this way.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.415
The next morning
was the first time

22:08.460 --> 22:09.950
in six months
of marriage that

22:09.990 --> 22:12.652
Wes and I didn't speak
a word, other than...

22:12.690 --> 22:14.397
Don't forget, we have
the party for Dr. Chang

22:14.430 --> 22:15.795
at my parents' house
tonight.

22:15.830 --> 22:18.492
You sure that's still
a good idea? Nope.

22:21.540 --> 22:22.837
But that didn't stop me

22:22.870 --> 22:25.362
from going to decorate
the back yard.

22:25.410 --> 22:30.940
<i>* Xk</i>

22:30.980 --> 22:36.510
<i>* Xk</i>

22:36.550 --> 22:40.487
[ Twig snaps,
leaves rustle ]

22:40.520 --> 22:41.453
Mom?

22:41.490 --> 22:43.788
Stel-belle!

22:43.830 --> 22:44.820
Hi, honey!

22:44.860 --> 22:48.398
What are you --
What are you doing here, honey?

22:48.430 --> 22:49.591
What are you doing here?

22:49.630 --> 22:52.861
Oh, um...
I came to see your dad.

22:52.900 --> 22:55.562
But first I stopped
and got some...

22:55.600 --> 22:58.399
some vodka for courage
and a...

22:58.440 --> 23:01.740
Slim Jim...
for protein.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.748
For some reason, I can't seem
to make it past the yard,

23:03.780 --> 23:05.600
so you know what,
I think I'm just gonna spend

23:05.650 --> 23:07.846
the rest of the day
in this bush.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.110
Oh, hey, look.
No, it's a vodka bush.

23:10.150 --> 23:14.553
I haven't seen you yet.
No, no. No. Okay, uh...

23:14.590 --> 23:16.684
I'm gonna take you inside. Okay.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.688
You and Dad have
to fix this. Yeah.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.495
All right, and that starts
with you telling him the truth.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.498
Yeah. Okay.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.059
Aiden!

23:29.700 --> 23:32.499
Okay, time to heal.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.975
I'm in love with Poppy.

23:35.010 --> 23:36.171
Wait, what?

23:36.210 --> 23:37.280
Mom, I thought we agreed

23:37.310 --> 23:39.642
that you were gonna give Dad
a chance to fix this?

23:39.680 --> 23:41.444
I -1, um,
I thought I was, too.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.585
But when I pounded
those mini bottles

23:43.620 --> 23:44.690
and I snapped
into the Slim Jim,

23:44.720 --> 23:46.540
something in me snapped.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.581
Mom, what are you doing?

23:48.620 --> 23:50.827
I'm coming out.

23:50.860 --> 23:54.091
As a bi...
sexual person.

23:54.130 --> 23:55.450
Is that how you say it?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.752
I'm new, so I don't
know the lingo yet.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.098
You can't be bi.
You're almost 50!

23:59.130 --> 24:01.997
Sexuality doesn't have
a statute of limitations, Peter.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.769
Sexuality is fluid.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.232
Oh, really?
Where did you hear that?

24:05.270 --> 24:07.705
Shouldn't I be able to do
what makes me happy?

24:07.740 --> 24:10.641
I thought
I made you happy.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.671
You did, Peter,
a long time ago.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.974
Really, Ida? This is
coming out of nowhere!

24:15.020 --> 24:17.114
Coming out of nowhere?
This is happening right now!

24:17.150 --> 24:19.744
As I watched my parents'
marriage fall apart,

24:19.790 --> 24:20.951
all I could think was...

24:20.990 --> 24:23.015
Guys, what about the party
tonight?

24:23.060 --> 24:25.927
I'll be there. Me, too,
sweetie. We're still a family.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.655
Sure, we're a family
when it suits you...

24:27.700 --> 24:29.122
I know that seems selfish,

24:29.160 --> 24:31.527
but I didn't want
to let down Dr. Chang.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.924
Tonight should be fun.

24:37.710 --> 24:41.977
I cannot believe we're going
through this with party.

24:42.010 --> 24:46.607
I cannot believe
mom is a bi.

24:46.650 --> 24:48.072
What are we gonna do?

24:48.120 --> 24:52.682
* You can get lost
in the music forever *

24:52.720 --> 24:54.518
Are you asking me
or yourself?

24:54.560 --> 24:57.723
I'm not sure.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.593
I used to have all the answers,
but now I don't.

25:00.630 --> 25:05.591
I don't know
anything at all.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.769
Hmm.
* The world's still spinning

25:07.800 --> 25:11.065
That's called growing up,
kid.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.737
What do you know
about growing up?

25:12.770 --> 25:15.102
You still mix chocolate milk
in your mouth.

25:15.140 --> 25:18.007
Because that's
the right way to do it.

25:18.050 --> 25:23.545
Look, I know enough
about growing up to know...

25:23.590 --> 25:24.546
it's not for me.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.911
I also know that it
doesn't happen overnight.

25:26.950 --> 25:29.157
It takes decades.
So...

25:31.790 --> 25:33.724
you can't give up.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.159
You beat certain death.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.659
I think you can figure out
how to handle uncertain life.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.739
You're right.

25:43.770 --> 25:46.569
Hey, can I use that line
for my speech tonight?

25:48.740 --> 25:50.333
What did I just say?

25:50.380 --> 25:51.677
Are you serious?

25:51.710 --> 25:53.041
You just said it.

25:53.080 --> 25:56.118
Like, we just had
an entire conversation.

25:56.150 --> 25:57.618
We did?
Yeah.

25:57.650 --> 26:00.779
You give me
really good advice.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.926
And as a thank you,
I said that I was...

26:03.960 --> 26:06.622
gonna hook you up with
Dr. Chang tonight at her party.

26:06.660 --> 26:09.357
Cool! Oh.
You said you'd wear a tie.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.993
You said you'd even
decorate the bark yard

26:11.030 --> 26:13.362
so I could go change
and write my speech.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.890
Really?

26:14.940 --> 26:18.205
I don't think I'm the sort
of guy who decorates and...

26:18.240 --> 26:20.163
I'm pretty sure
I don't own a tie.

26:20.210 --> 26:23.134
No, you got this.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.274
This a chandelier?

26:25.310 --> 26:28.769
<i>* Xk</i>

26:28.820 --> 26:30.982
Hey.
What are you up to?

26:31.020 --> 26:35.059
I just finished writing
my speech for Dr. Chang.

26:35.090 --> 26:36.785
I think
it's really bad-ass,

26:36.820 --> 26:38.288
and I wrote it
on cocktail napkins,

26:38.330 --> 26:39.729
which is great
because then we can just

26:39.760 --> 26:41.023
repurpose them
for cocktails.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.357
They're actually
made from bamboo,

26:42.400 --> 26:44.095
which I thought it was
just used for panda food,

26:44.130 --> 26:45.620
but it turns out you can use it
for a lot of reusable stuff,

26:45.670 --> 26:47.069
like plates and napkins
and even diapers.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.159
Are you doing
that thing where you...

26:49.200 --> 26:53.239
over-talk to avoid having
a real conversation?

26:53.270 --> 26:55.375
I think so.

26:55.410 --> 26:56.730
It's just that I--

26:56.780 --> 26:58.077
Look, I'm sorry.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.716
Sorry. You go.

27:00.750 --> 27:05.085
Stella, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you I wanted to have kids.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.158
I really am.
It's just at the time...

27:08.190 --> 27:11.387
we didn't have a...
a future.

27:13.430 --> 27:17.253
But now we do,
and I'm so happy about that.

27:17.300 --> 27:20.122
I want to be honest
about who we are.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.709
You go first.
Why do I have to go first?

27:24.740 --> 27:27.038
Because I won the coin toss.
When was there a coin toss?

27:27.070 --> 27:31.803
It happened earlier.
You missed it, unfortunately.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.875
Okay.
Okay, I'll go first.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.787
"Love Actually”
isn't my favorite movie.

27:42.820 --> 27:44.754
Oh.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.827
Okay, go on.

27:46.860 --> 27:49.830
I don't love
hard-boiled eggs.

27:49.860 --> 27:52.067
I mean, they're your favorite,
but they're not mine.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.432
I don't love the music
of Sara Bareilles, either.

27:54.470 --> 27:57.861
I mean, I'm British. I can't
allow myself to be that happy.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.880
Also, I'd like you
to spank me, maybe --

28:00.910 --> 28:03.436
not all the time,
just maybe during sex --

28:03.480 --> 28:06.245
or if we're playing a team sport
and I do a really good job.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.170
Um, I don't love the --
I don't love the way that, um...

28:09.220 --> 28:12.850
I can't keep going outside
every time I have to fart.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.016
I mean, winter's coming,

28:14.060 --> 28:17.280
I'm not gonna be able to spend
that kind of time outdoors.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.152
Also...

28:19.190 --> 28:21.249
I don't love
being your pillow.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.052
It is nice for a minute,

28:23.100 --> 28:25.819
but then my arm falls asleep
and there's a real chance

28:25.870 --> 28:27.793
I'm developing
permanent nerve damage.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.194
If I can't lift
my hands above my head,

28:29.240 --> 28:30.799
how am I ever gonna
wash my hair?

28:30.840 --> 28:33.229
Well, you know what,
it's not important.

28:34.940 --> 28:37.272
What is important is...

28:38.980 --> 28:40.209
...I love you.

28:40.250 --> 28:43.709
And I'm so sorry
that I have lied to you.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.914
Can you ever forgive me?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.827
I couldn't answer
because I didn't know.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.227
Stella?
I didn't know him.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.025
Hey, little sis,
back yard is all done.

28:57.060 --> 28:58.494
Apparently,
I do decorate.

28:58.530 --> 29:01.761
Marlene is finishing up some
fabulous little centerpiece.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.303
Why is Marlene here? You
invited her at your funeral.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.866
I told you I was setting you up
with Dr. Chang tonight.

29:06.910 --> 29:08.400
Does Dr. Chang know that?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.772
-Yes.
-Yikes!

29:10.810 --> 29:12.107
Uh, well,
this is awkward.

29:12.150 --> 29:15.176
Good evening,
party people.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.517
Oh.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.110
Oh!
This is a bag of poop!

29:20.150 --> 29:21.857
-Yep.
-I tried to stop her.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.382
It's a little thank you for
your wonderful work babysitting.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.558
Leaving that dinner
cost my firm the client,

29:26.590 --> 29:28.490
so happy ring hunting.

29:28.530 --> 29:31.921
Could tonight get
any worse?

29:31.970 --> 29:34.337
Hello, family.
Really?

29:34.370 --> 29:35.997
Poppy,
what are you doing here?

29:36.040 --> 29:37.030
You invited me
at your funeral.

29:37.070 --> 29:38.868
You invited everyone.

29:38.910 --> 29:41.333
And she's my date.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.007
Your date?
Did I miss something?

29:43.040 --> 29:44.906
Uh,
I -- I definitely did.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.941
Oh, Mom has decided
to be a bi with Poppy.

29:46.980 --> 29:49.347
We don't have to put
labels on it, but...

29:49.380 --> 29:52.145
we recently upped the level
of physical intimacy.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.919
Uh.
That was an over-share.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.156
No, please, regale us
all with tales

29:56.190 --> 29:57.828
of your progressive
lesbianism.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.282
Oh, good. Dad's here.

29:59.330 --> 30:01.025
Peter,
you smell like a bar.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.459
That makes sense.

30:02.500 --> 30:06.027
We have to sell the house
and work until we're 80.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.834
Wait, if we sell the house,

30:07.870 --> 30:09.429
where are we going to
have family dinners?

30:09.470 --> 30:11.131
That's what you're
worried about?

30:11.170 --> 30:13.104
I think we can let go of
family dinners at this point.

30:13.140 --> 30:15.529
No one ever really appreciated
all the work I put in.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.207
So I, for one,
would like to be done.

30:17.240 --> 30:20.949
You can't be done, Ida.
That's now how family works.

30:20.980 --> 30:21.970
Wait!

30:22.020 --> 30:24.079
If we sell our house,
where am I going to live?

30:24.120 --> 30:25.884
Dr. Chang: You guys?!

30:25.920 --> 30:29.083
You guys,
this is so awesome!

30:29.120 --> 30:31.088
And you even got me a banner.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.521
Whoa!
Sexy doctor alert!

30:34.560 --> 30:37.222
Hey, I'm here with someone,
she's outside.

30:37.260 --> 30:39.194
Not serious.
But she does exist.

30:39.230 --> 30:42.131
Okay!
Everybody outside --

30:42.170 --> 30:43.035
now!

30:43.070 --> 30:47.974
<i>* Xk</i>

30:48.010 --> 30:51.002
* You shut me down

30:51.050 --> 30:53.974
* You like the control

30:54.020 --> 30:59.220
* Try to hold it down,
I know the answer *

30:59.250 --> 31:05.428
<i>* I can shake it off
and you feel threatened by me *</i>

31:05.460 --> 31:06.950
* I tried to play it nice
but *

31:06.990 --> 31:09.550
* Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh

31:09.600 --> 31:10.897
* Don't kill my vibe

31:10.930 --> 31:13.900
As I watch my cocktail napkin
speech blow in the wind,

31:13.940 --> 31:17.968
it dawned on me this could be
one of those epic movie moments

31:18.010 --> 31:19.330
where the heroine's speech

31:19.370 --> 31:21.429
brings her entire family
back together.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.572
* Don't you

31:22.610 --> 31:24.078
* Don't kill my vibe

31:24.110 --> 31:26.249
* I tried to play it nice but

31:26.280 --> 31:29.079
* Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh

31:29.120 --> 31:32.647
* Don't kill my vibe

31:32.690 --> 31:35.216
* Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh

31:35.260 --> 31:37.683
* Don't break my stride

31:37.720 --> 31:40.519
* Don't kill my vibe

31:40.560 --> 31:44.064
Most people think death
is the opposite of life.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.329
But it's not.

31:45.370 --> 31:49.295
Death is the opposite of...
something.

31:49.340 --> 31:52.970
Life is a circle,
and if that's true,

31:53.010 --> 31:56.332
why are we
so obsessed with...

31:56.380 --> 31:57.700
making progress?

31:57.740 --> 32:00.141
This was not a movie moment.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.479
Thank you, Dr. Chang.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.181
Whoo!

32:10.460 --> 32:12.679
Thank you, Stella.
That was, uh...

32:12.730 --> 32:14.152
a speech.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.123
Stella, what was that?
Are you on drugs? No.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.198
Well...yes, I was
when I wrote this, but--

32:19.230 --> 32:21.164
Relax, Mom, it's just weed.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.998
No, that is
a gateway drug.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.101
Who are you to lecture anybody
on acceptable behavior, Ida?

32:26.140 --> 32:27.539
Peter, I know how you
must feel, but--

32:27.570 --> 32:29.106
Do you, Poppy?

32:29.140 --> 32:30.278
You have any idea
how hard it is

32:30.310 --> 32:32.972
to watch the love of your life
leave you?

32:33.010 --> 32:36.310
Or what it feels like to think
at least if she was with a man,

32:36.350 --> 32:38.079
I could beat
the crap out of him?

32:38.120 --> 32:39.679
Oh, that is mature.

32:39.720 --> 32:43.088
As usual, you will do anything
other than be vulnerable.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.054
What do you want to hear,
Ida?!

32:45.090 --> 32:47.388
That I've been scared every day
for the last eights years

32:47.430 --> 32:50.991
because I thought we were
gonna lose our little girl?

32:51.030 --> 32:52.566
Because I was.

32:52.600 --> 32:56.138
You didn't have
a monopoly on grief,

32:56.170 --> 32:58.036
But unlike you,
I didn't have the luxury

32:58.070 --> 32:59.469
of wearing my heart
on my sleeve

32:59.510 --> 33:03.105
because someone had to be
strong for our kids!

33:03.140 --> 33:04.369
And you may not
want to admit it,

33:04.410 --> 33:07.209
but you needed me to be
strong for you, too.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.309
I wanted to feel like
we were in it together.

33:09.350 --> 33:11.182
You want to be in it
together?

33:11.220 --> 33:13.484
Stop getting naked
with family friends!

33:13.520 --> 33:16.217
Okay, guys!

33:16.260 --> 33:19.025
You both did the best
you could to get

33:19.060 --> 33:22.325
through an impossible
situation -- you all did.

33:22.360 --> 33:25.421
That's -- That's what I was
trying to say in my speech.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.199
That's what
you were going for?

33:27.230 --> 33:30.029
'Cause that did not
come across at all.

33:30.070 --> 33:32.038
The point is...

33:32.070 --> 33:34.732
our problems are fixable.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.600
Mom, Dad...

33:36.640 --> 33:40.042
deep down, you still
really love each other,

33:40.080 --> 33:41.343
and you can
work this out.

33:41.380 --> 33:43.109
Aiden,

33:43.150 --> 33:44.311
you deserve
to be in a relationship

33:44.350 --> 33:46.318
with someone
who is not married.

33:46.350 --> 33:49.183
I-I seriously think it will help
you get your life on track.

33:49.220 --> 33:50.312
I'm sorry, Marlene.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.089
And, Lizzie,
what happened to you?

33:52.130 --> 33:53.689
You used to be so fun,

33:53.730 --> 33:55.698
but now you're so stressed
about your kids and your job.

33:55.730 --> 33:58.665
So you lost a client?
I mean, who cares, so what?

33:58.700 --> 34:00.589
I bet you don't even know
what your firm does.

34:00.630 --> 34:02.598
-Of course I do.
-Of course you do.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.234
I just don't because I know
that this career of yours

34:05.270 --> 34:07.602
is not your real passion.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.199
You used to want to be
a writer, remember?

34:10.239 --> 34:13.244
Writing made you so happy.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.350
So you need to go do that,

34:14.380 --> 34:16.109
because you are not happy,
Lizzie.

34:16.150 --> 34:17.311
Well, how could I be?

34:17.350 --> 34:20.411
Your cancer always
came before my happiness.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.110
Yes, writing used
to make me happy,

34:22.159 --> 34:25.551
but I gave that up when I gave
up a scholarship to Columbia

34:25.590 --> 34:27.752
to stay here and help
take care of you.

34:27.790 --> 34:29.121
Sweetheart.

34:29.159 --> 34:32.369
What?

34:32.400 --> 34:35.233
I didn't know about that.
Of course you didn't.

34:35.270 --> 34:38.308
Because it was our job
to make your life beautiful.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.661
But behind the scenes,
we were a mess.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.303
Look at Aiden.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.342
The thought of losing somebody
he cared about made him

34:44.380 --> 34:46.268
stop caring about
anything at all.

34:46.310 --> 34:48.210
I feel like you're
psychoanalyzing me

34:48.250 --> 34:49.672
unnecessarily,

34:49.719 --> 34:51.141
and I'm good, guys.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.181
I'm great.

34:53.219 --> 34:55.518
In fact, I've nevell\'/I been better.
an: Stay away from Marlene!

34:55.560 --> 34:56.789
What?

35:01.330 --> 35:02.752
Oh, God, Aiden!

35:02.800 --> 35:06.293
<i>* Xk</i>

35:06.330 --> 35:09.300
I
-Aiden!

35:09.340 --> 35:14.301
<i>* Xk</i>

35:17.580 --> 35:18.775
It's starting to happen.
I don't care.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.471
Nelson,
if you leave now,

35:20.510 --> 35:22.239
everything we had
will be perfect forever.

35:22.280 --> 35:26.285
Sara,
life isn't perfect.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.209
It can be beautiful.

35:30.360 --> 35:31.885
Don't you see?

35:31.930 --> 35:36.356
Um, I don't think patients
are allowed to drink wine.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.700
Good thing I'm not
a patient then.

35:39.730 --> 35:41.596
So why are you here?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.666
I like the views of
the city from this window.

35:46.810 --> 35:49.529
And also, when I was sick,
this was my room.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.514
Rough day?

35:54.550 --> 35:57.872
Turns out my...
family's a disaster,

35:57.920 --> 36:02.312
and I can't seem to be
able to fix anything.

36:02.360 --> 36:06.183
My cancer has ruined
my family's lives and...

36:06.230 --> 36:08.551
Oh, my God, I'm complaining
to a cancer patient

36:08.600 --> 36:11.365
about how hard my life is.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.392
You sound like a...

36:14.440 --> 36:18.707
dying girl from one
of these sappy cancer movies.

36:18.740 --> 36:20.629
Trying to fix everybody
else's problems

36:20.670 --> 36:23.230
just so you can avoid
facing your own fears.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.375
That is not
what I'm doing.

36:26.410 --> 36:29.710
That is exactly
what I was doing.

36:29.750 --> 36:33.380
I'm Sadie, by the way.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.388
Hi, Sadie.

36:37.390 --> 36:38.425
I'm Stella.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.428
Look, if you ever want
to talk about anything,

36:43.460 --> 36:46.361
I would be happy to...

36:46.400 --> 36:48.732
just listen.

36:48.770 --> 36:51.501
Just listen.

36:51.540 --> 36:54.271
No, if cancer
taught me one thing...

36:54.310 --> 36:57.439
it's that you can get
through anything...

36:57.480 --> 36:59.608
as long as someone
has your back.

37:03.380 --> 37:05.712
Also, an old guy died
in that bed today,

37:05.750 --> 37:08.219
and I don't think
it's been cleaned.

37:10.390 --> 37:14.327
* If you need to keep

37:14.360 --> 37:15.395
As I walked down the hall,

37:15.430 --> 37:17.751
wishing I had another
bottle of wine,

37:17.800 --> 37:19.290
I couldn't help but wonder,

37:19.330 --> 37:21.367
now that I wasn't sick,

37:21.400 --> 37:24.529
did anyone have my back?

37:24.570 --> 37:26.436
Hey.

37:29.540 --> 37:32.601
Thought I might
find you here.

37:32.650 --> 37:35.449
And that you might
want this.

37:35.480 --> 37:39.314
And then I realized...
he did.

37:39.350 --> 37:43.014
<i>* Xk</i>

37:45.430 --> 37:51.494
* You're the fire
and the flood *

37:51.530 --> 37:56.366
* And I'll always feel you
in my blood *

37:56.400 --> 37:58.562
Yeah, you like that?
I do.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.408
I don't love
the Q&A afterwards.

38:00.440 --> 38:03.501
* Everything is fine

38:03.540 --> 38:06.703
* When your hand is
resting next to mine *

38:06.750 --> 38:08.445
Wow.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.448
Whoa.
I had no idea we could

38:10.480 --> 38:13.381
get so much done
in such a short window.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.309
It that too short?
No.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.385
No, it was hot.
Okay.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.819
You really know
how to get 'er done.

38:18.860 --> 38:20.350
Well...

38:25.900 --> 38:28.460
Listen...

38:28.500 --> 38:30.434
I'm sorry, too.

38:30.470 --> 38:32.359
Sorry, what for?

38:32.410 --> 38:36.005
Not getting to know
the real you.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.929
But I do want to.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.379
And...

38:41.550 --> 38:44.383
...] want you
to know the real me.

38:44.420 --> 38:46.445
And the real me is...

38:46.490 --> 38:48.310
terrified.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.357
What are you terrified of?

38:52.390 --> 38:54.085
The future.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.494
That I'll...

38:58.530 --> 39:00.999
screw it up or waste it.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.433
What I'm really scared of

39:04.470 --> 39:06.768
is that you might not be
okay with all this.

39:09.110 --> 39:14.048
Our forever just got a whole lot
longer than you were expecting.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.445
Stella...

39:15.480 --> 39:18.484
I know I promised you...

39:18.520 --> 39:21.649
that I would love you
for the rest of your life...

39:23.890 --> 39:27.349
I was always gonna love you
for the rest of mine.

39:29.460 --> 39:32.566
You just weren't gonna
be around to see it.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.398
If you really
don't want kids--

39:34.440 --> 39:36.499
I do want kids.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.099
I used to picture myself
with a little girl.

39:43.610 --> 39:44.907
I was just...

39:44.950 --> 39:48.671
I was scared to let myself want
something that I couldn't have.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.417
But, baby,
you can have that now.

39:51.450 --> 39:52.485
What if she gets sick?

39:52.520 --> 39:54.716
Oh, babe, no, no, no.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.513
You can't think like that.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.427
You're not sick anymore.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.497
I promise you...

40:02.530 --> 40:04.089
whatever comes our way,

40:04.130 --> 40:07.862
whatever tomorrow holds...

40:07.900 --> 40:09.595
we'll get through it
together.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.439
Really?
Always.

40:12.470 --> 40:14.438
And I love you so much.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.777
I love you.

40:17.510 --> 40:21.105
So there it was --
the end of my cancer movie...

40:21.150 --> 40:23.915
but the beginning
of my life sentence --

40:23.950 --> 40:26.544
which was full of promise.

40:26.590 --> 40:27.739
* When I was six years old

40:27.790 --> 40:30.452
You sure we can afford for me
to stay at home and write?

40:30.490 --> 40:31.821
Yes.
Yes?

40:31.860 --> 40:33.589
We can't afford
for you not to. Come on.

40:33.630 --> 40:35.519
<i>* I was running from my</i>

40:36.530 --> 40:37.793
<i>-Okay!
-Okay, quys.</i>

40:37.830 --> 40:39.468
I'm gonna get this one.
Give me this one!

40:39.500 --> 40:41.491
You take that one.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.939
* Sweet perfume

40:42.970 --> 40:46.099
* Of the mountain grass
I rolled down *

40:46.140 --> 40:50.839
And, sure, none of us knew
what would happen next.

40:50.880 --> 40:55.147
* Take me back to when I

40:55.180 --> 40:57.979
I really gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do with my life.

40:59.690 --> 41:00.543
So do I.

41:00.590 --> 41:02.183
* Through the years

41:02.220 --> 41:07.056
* And I've not seen
the roaring fields in so long *

41:07.090 --> 41:09.525
Marlene's pregnant.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.895
*I'm on my way

41:13.930 --> 41:16.194
Oh.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.937
One thing I did know
was that from now on,

41:18.970 --> 41:22.099
it would be up to me
to host family dinners.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.801
Don't get me wrong,
one awkward evening

41:23.840 --> 41:25.205
where my dad got drunk

41:25.250 --> 41:27.605
and called my mom and Poppy
scissor sisters three times

41:27.650 --> 41:30.119
doesn't mean
everything's okay.

41:30.150 --> 41:33.245
That's what they call 'em.
Scissor sisters.

41:35.560 --> 41:40.726
Still for the first time since
I found out I wasn't dying...

41:40.760 --> 41:43.798
I was truly happy
to be alive.

41:43.830 --> 41:48.563
* Over the castle
on the hill *
