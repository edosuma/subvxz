00:00.275 --> 00:01.921
Previously on Life Unexpected...

00:02.146 --> 00:03.398
You don't have to be alone.

00:03.643 --> 00:06.295
There's plenty of guys who
would date you for real.

00:06.651 --> 00:07.751
You seem to forget I'm your boss.

00:10.399 --> 00:11.749
There's something called
independent living.

00:11.817 --> 00:13.417
I'm gonna have my own place?

00:13.485 --> 00:14.919
We're going to find you
an apartment nearby.

00:14.986 --> 00:17.345
I can't believe you guys
would do that for me.

00:17.942 --> 00:19.643
So, um, Julia's your ex?

00:19.694 --> 00:21.344
Yes, Julia and I dated.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.638
According to Paige, she was the

00:22.639 --> 00:24.481
love of your life,
which is a pretty big thing

00:24.549 --> 00:27.890
- to never mention in three years.
- When you and I broke up,

00:28.130 --> 00:30.131
Julia and I slept together.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.532
Julia came to me

00:31.600 --> 00:33.901
and she said that she
thought she was pregnant.

00:33.969 --> 00:35.603
What if she had been pregnant?

00:35.670 --> 00:36.737
Would you call off the wedding?

00:36.805 --> 00:38.589
I don't know.

00:38.657 --> 00:39.957
Baze told me everything, Cate.

00:40.042 --> 00:43.277
He said you were afraid that
you were in love with him?

00:43.345 --> 00:45.913
No. I put those feelings to bed
the second that I said, "I do".

00:45.964 --> 00:47.298
What would you have done?

00:47.382 --> 00:49.884
Not now, but then, if he had
told you that he loved you?

00:49.951 --> 00:52.086
I don't know.

00:52.154 --> 00:54.688
I see you've met Mr. Daniels.

00:55.690 --> 00:56.924
- You're a...
- Teacher.

01:03.482 --> 01:05.349
I won't let you go.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.811
Check out the desperate housewife.

01:50.862 --> 01:51.929
Hey, Paige, what's up?

01:51.997 --> 01:52.997
I'm just, uh...

01:53.081 --> 01:55.649
- doing laundry.
- Bummer.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.134
My solution is to wear

01:57.202 --> 01:58.669
as little clothing as possible.

01:58.753 --> 01:59.737
Hey, is Ryan here?

01:59.805 --> 02:00.821
He keeps bugging me

02:00.872 --> 02:02.323
to talk to him about careers

02:02.390 --> 02:03.379
and getting a job.

02:03.511 --> 02:06.863
No. He went on a jog,
and then we have this thing.

02:06.931 --> 02:10.066
Ooh, couple's therapy...
Yeah, he told me.

02:10.150 --> 02:11.026
Yeah, it's just to work

02:11.026 --> 02:12.702
- through some trust issues, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

02:12.770 --> 02:15.963
Is that why you're snooping
through his phone?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.843
This Julia thing is just

02:19.910 --> 02:22.877
- driving me nuts.
- Well, cell phone's a good start,

02:22.878 --> 02:24.671
but I'd check the glove
compartment of his car...

02:24.672 --> 02:28.032
The go-to place for
the stashing of panties.

02:28.099 --> 02:29.056
I'm not looking for panties.

02:29.057 --> 02:30.640
I just want to know what happened

02:30.691 --> 02:33.242
between my husband and some
woman that I know nothing about.

02:33.310 --> 02:36.429
You know, when it happened, where...

02:36.497 --> 02:37.580
How many times?

02:39.738 --> 02:40.374
Yeah.

02:42.418 --> 02:44.107
How long were he and Julia even dating?

02:45.229 --> 02:46.057
Nice try.

02:46.703 --> 02:48.054
Yeah, see, I'm not going to tell Ryan

02:48.055 --> 02:48.708
about the cell phone,

02:48.709 --> 02:50.458
but I'm not going to
sell him out either.

02:51.344 --> 02:53.228
Look, if you want the dirt,
ask him yourself.

03:11.926 --> 03:14.809
Maybe we should, uh...
get back to the office

03:14.810 --> 03:17.479
before people notice that
we both took a long lunch.

03:18.802 --> 03:20.754
You don't have to
worry because I, uh...

03:21.333 --> 03:23.701
'Cause I blocked off extra time

03:23.769 --> 03:25.853
on the calendar for employee relations.

03:27.489 --> 03:29.557
Get it? Employee relations?

03:29.625 --> 03:31.008
I get it.

03:32.077 --> 03:33.878
Oh! Ow! Oh!

03:33.946 --> 03:34.912
You okay?

03:34.980 --> 03:36.330
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

03:36.381 --> 03:37.748
Look at this.

03:37.833 --> 03:40.701
I got Lux's new basketball shoes.

03:41.670 --> 03:43.087
Wait till you have a kid.

03:43.172 --> 03:44.338
You'll get it. Stuff everywhere.

03:44.389 --> 03:46.107
Of course, you'll probably
be a lot better

03:46.175 --> 03:48.843
- parent than I am, of course.
- We're kind of on a clock here.

03:48.894 --> 03:50.411
Right. Sorry.

03:58.437 --> 03:59.737
Oh, great.

04:01.974 --> 04:03.774
Hello.

04:07.880 --> 04:08.913
Oh.

04:08.997 --> 04:11.549
That's okay. No, um...

04:11.617 --> 04:14.118
I'll be there right away. Mm-hmm.

04:17.289 --> 04:20.708
Uh, a pipe burst in my kitchen.

04:20.759 --> 04:22.326
I should, uh...

04:22.394 --> 04:24.545
go.

04:24.596 --> 04:26.898
Do you... do you want some help?

04:26.965 --> 04:28.749
No. I got it. Really it's, um...

04:28.800 --> 04:30.635
It's why I pay a
maintenance fee, you know.

04:30.719 --> 04:32.687
It covers everything.

04:32.754 --> 04:37.141
Well, um, so are we... are we
still on for our date tonight?

04:47.819 --> 04:49.603
Ah, you're here.

04:50.656 --> 04:52.590
- Finally.
- Sorry. We had to go

04:52.658 --> 04:55.743
to, like, three different stores
to find the good peanut butter.

04:55.794 --> 04:56.545
You're in a new place.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.730
I just want you to feel
at home here, you know,

04:58.798 --> 04:59.764
and have everything you need.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.783
And the place... looks great.

05:03.324 --> 05:04.291
Ah, check it!

05:04.401 --> 05:06.317
You got me cereal with a decoder ring.

05:06.318 --> 05:08.233
You rock, Cate.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.185
I also got you this.

05:10.252 --> 05:12.103
It's uh, it's linked to my account

05:12.154 --> 05:15.356
for emergencies and
food and whatever.

05:15.441 --> 05:18.476
Cate, you've already
done so much for me.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.029
You got me this apartment,
the furniture.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.815
Thank you.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.483
Thank you!

05:25.534 --> 05:27.335
I promise I won't go crazy,

05:27.419 --> 05:30.205
and, like, buy a car
or bad peanut butter.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.675
All right, well,

05:33.742 --> 05:36.294
I'm just going to hang
out here, I think.

05:36.345 --> 05:38.930
Tasha and I, we have
some homework to do.

05:38.997 --> 05:40.431
Yeah, we gots us a
big test coming up.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.884
All right, just call me when
you need to get picked up.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.962
Thanks, Cate.

05:47.183 --> 05:49.383
Bye.

05:54.453 --> 05:55.932
Sorry.

05:57.505 --> 05:58.605
Sorry.

05:58.672 --> 06:00.507
I... I tried to get her

06:00.558 --> 06:02.959
to stay in the car, but...

06:03.027 --> 06:04.995
Hi.

06:05.062 --> 06:06.398
Uh, next time you decide

06:06.399 --> 06:08.681
to have an illicit
affair with a student,

06:08.733 --> 06:13.420
I'd say ditch the roommates
and get your own apartment.

06:16.690 --> 06:20.076
So what do you want to do today?

06:20.144 --> 06:22.612
Oh, maybe hang out there?

06:22.680 --> 06:24.898
Ooh, how about over there?

06:24.966 --> 06:26.233
Maybe right here.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.652
I know our options
are kind of limited.

06:28.719 --> 06:30.103
Limited?

06:30.137 --> 06:32.228
We can't go for coffee,
we can't go to the movies,

06:32.229 --> 06:33.929
we can't even walk down
the street together.

06:33.980 --> 06:36.135
I know, it sucks. I'm sorry.

06:36.222 --> 06:37.723
No, it's not your fault.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.558
You're Minnesota.
I'm Eeyore.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.510
We are who we are.

06:45.682 --> 06:48.083
Hey, what if we don't have to be?

06:48.151 --> 06:49.818
What are you doing Saturday?

06:49.903 --> 06:52.087
Can you keep it free... all day?

06:52.155 --> 06:53.485
Why?

06:53.486 --> 06:55.480
'Cause you and I are going on a date.

06:57.464 --> 07:01.133
A healthy relationship
can't be built on lies.

07:01.217 --> 07:03.995
And clearly that's been a
problem for the both of you.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.816
Ryan, you lied about Julia.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.818
Cate, you lied about Baze.

07:07.869 --> 07:10.121
Twice. She lied about Baze twice.

07:10.172 --> 07:12.089
And about wanting a baby.

07:12.157 --> 07:14.592
Yeah. Not really cool to
keep score in therapy.

07:14.659 --> 07:16.811
When was the last time that you lied?

07:16.878 --> 07:18.446
Or withheld something from the other?

07:19.598 --> 07:21.682
Last night. This morning.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.000
Couples often lie,

07:23.068 --> 07:26.520
thinking that they're
protecting the relationship.

07:26.588 --> 07:29.358
But little lies grow into bigger lies,

07:29.488 --> 07:31.575
creating a pattern of dishonesty.

07:31.745 --> 07:35.048
So I want you to try an exercise.

07:35.132 --> 07:36.532
Until the next time you see me,

07:36.584 --> 07:38.735
I want you to be completely
honest with each other

07:38.802 --> 07:40.069
about everything.

07:40.137 --> 07:42.472
Are we talking
you-look-fat-in-those-pants honest,

07:42.540 --> 07:44.314
or I-hate-this-marriage honest?

07:44.575 --> 07:45.500
I don't.

07:45.523 --> 07:46.523
I mean about all of it.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.025
Do you think you can do that?

07:48.076 --> 07:49.610
- Yeah.
- Sure.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.812
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

07:58.586 --> 08:00.704
Cobra team! Man down!

08:00.755 --> 08:02.840
Prepare the vital fluids!

08:05.617 --> 08:07.302
Look what the cat dragged in.

08:07.369 --> 08:08.903
Jamie, my man. How did you

08:08.904 --> 08:09.883
get your mom to let
you out of the house?

08:10.014 --> 08:11.965
Finished his chore chart
and got a gold star.

08:12.016 --> 08:13.467
She's visiting my aunt for the weekend,

08:13.518 --> 08:15.419
so I'm free to hang out with you morons.

08:15.486 --> 08:16.803
Starting with half-price nachos.

08:16.854 --> 08:18.121
Peel off that monkey suit

08:18.189 --> 08:19.172
and join us.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.757
I can't.

08:20.825 --> 08:24.232
Emma and I are supposed
to go out for tapas.

08:25.634 --> 08:26.192
So I'm going to pretend

08:26.315 --> 08:27.865
for the sake of your own manhood

08:27.933 --> 08:29.607
that you just said topless.

08:29.952 --> 08:31.285
Then again, you know what,

08:31.370 --> 08:33.988
she did just have this whole
pipe situation, so let me just...

08:34.073 --> 08:36.823
let me give her a call and we'll see.

08:36.909 --> 08:38.659
He's been like this for weeks.

08:38.744 --> 08:40.711
It's called a relationship.

08:40.779 --> 08:41.996
There's a give and a take.

08:42.081 --> 08:43.581
So what's next?

08:43.631 --> 08:45.449
She going to give you her purse to hold

08:45.501 --> 08:47.168
or take you shopping for throw pillows?

08:48.387 --> 08:49.587
Hello.

08:49.638 --> 08:53.474
Um, yeah, I'm trying
to reach Emma Bradshaw.

08:53.559 --> 08:55.009
She's in the shower.

08:55.094 --> 08:57.779
Okay, can you tell her that Baze called?

09:00.399 --> 09:01.849
Stop it.

09:08.201 --> 09:13.201
Corrected by 4be1
www.addic7ed.com

09:23.807 --> 09:25.728
So... Astoria.

09:26.313 --> 09:26.853
Did you bring me here

09:26.954 --> 09:29.122
so I could eat my weight
in saltwater Taffy?

09:29.190 --> 09:33.827
No. I brought you here
so we could do this.

09:35.526 --> 09:37.784
We can do everything
we can't do at home.

09:37.965 --> 09:41.118
Hold hands, see a movie...

09:41.185 --> 09:43.370
Ride a tandem bike around the island.

09:43.438 --> 09:45.906
Okay, not that.

09:45.973 --> 09:48.025
We could have coffee, hmm?

09:48.109 --> 09:50.694
- Yeah.
- Right.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.529
Oh, no.

09:52.613 --> 09:54.164
What?

09:54.248 --> 09:56.416
My wallet.

09:56.484 --> 09:59.486
It must have fallen out.

10:14.158 --> 10:16.887
Baze. Um, what are you doing here?

10:17.025 --> 10:19.243
Well, I called last night

10:19.294 --> 10:21.512
and a guy answered.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.888
So I left a message with the guy.

10:27.025 --> 10:28.644
And I didn't hear anything back.

10:39.126 --> 10:39.923
Maybe you're too busy

10:39.933 --> 10:42.284
having a slumber party with the plumber.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.669
You know, you're right
about that maintenance fee...

10:43.736 --> 10:46.071
- It covers everything.
- Wait.

10:46.139 --> 10:47.516
You know what, if you want

10:47.517 --> 10:48.683
to be seeing someone
else, that's awesome.

10:48.751 --> 10:50.401
You just need to give
me a little heads up,

10:50.469 --> 10:52.103
because I thought that
we were in a relationship.

10:52.171 --> 10:54.439
Look, it's just more
complicated than I can explain

10:54.523 --> 10:55.516
right now.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.194
You and I...

11:00.088 --> 11:01.099
We're not in a relationship.

11:01.270 --> 11:04.589
You know, we sneak around,
we make out in cars...

11:04.656 --> 11:05.386
And on buses.

11:05.476 --> 11:06.579
Whatever. It hardly commits me

11:06.730 --> 11:08.665
to telling you about everything
that goes on in my life

11:08.732 --> 11:10.717
or-or makes it okay
that you show up here

11:10.784 --> 11:13.386
like some jealous boyfriend.

11:13.454 --> 11:16.489
I'm not jealous, okay?

11:16.557 --> 11:18.391
And, apparently,
I'm not even a boyfriend.

11:18.459 --> 11:19.993
I just need the facts.

11:21.216 --> 11:22.654
So if you want to be
dating other people,

11:22.714 --> 11:24.916
fine, but I can date other people, too.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.867
Lots of other people, dozens of people,

11:26.919 --> 11:27.952
thousands of people.

11:29.832 --> 11:31.089
Then you should do that.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.581
I'm not stopping you.

11:46.824 --> 11:47.499
Hey.

11:48.204 --> 11:49.039
Hey.

11:49.994 --> 11:51.494
I...

11:51.579 --> 11:53.136
If you were going to the market,

11:53.219 --> 11:55.370
I would've had you pick
up something for dinner.

11:55.438 --> 11:56.388
Oh, sorry.

11:56.455 --> 11:58.406
I... I told Paige we'd do something.

12:11.937 --> 12:14.055
Are you avoiding this honesty thing?

12:17.093 --> 12:18.259
Honestly?

12:20.312 --> 12:21.396
Yeah. Are you?

12:21.480 --> 12:22.547
I just ran ten miles,

12:22.598 --> 12:24.132
eight of them around the same block.

12:25.568 --> 12:27.402
This shouldn't be so hard.

12:27.486 --> 12:28.820
It's not like we've never been honest

12:28.888 --> 12:30.054
with each other, right?

12:30.106 --> 12:31.256
You shouldn't be

12:31.323 --> 12:33.057
having dinner with
your sister to avoid me.

12:34.551 --> 12:35.502
Why don't you just
reschedule with Paige,

12:35.583 --> 12:37.818
and you and I...
We can have dinner and talk.

12:37.886 --> 12:39.804
You know, I'll make that
Pesto pasta thing you like.

12:41.523 --> 12:42.940
Okay, well, if we're being honest,

12:43.024 --> 12:45.425
I, um, I hate that Pesto pasta thing.

12:47.622 --> 12:49.136
All right, well, in the
spirit of being honest,

12:49.206 --> 12:50.063
I hate that shirt on you.

12:50.142 --> 12:51.593
It makes you look busty.

12:53.646 --> 12:55.964
Maybe you should borrow it sometime.

12:59.402 --> 13:02.070
Ryan, I want to know about Julia.

13:02.154 --> 13:03.905
I already told you.

13:03.973 --> 13:06.408
No, I'm not just talking
about our wedding day.

13:07.618 --> 13:09.367
I want to know how you two met,
how long you dated,

13:09.368 --> 13:10.367
and how it ended.

13:10.435 --> 13:12.086
Look, Cate, you know
everything that matters.

13:12.153 --> 13:13.554
I mean, giving you a bunch of details

13:13.622 --> 13:14.872
about a relationship
that's in the past...

13:14.939 --> 13:17.257
It's not going to help us move forward.

13:17.325 --> 13:18.626
Just...

13:18.710 --> 13:20.711
Look, I'll be with Paige.

13:25.616 --> 13:29.286
All right, all I have is $12,
a coupon for free yogurt

13:29.354 --> 13:30.921
and our ferry tickets home.

13:30.972 --> 13:32.456
Ah, I know, this sucks.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.458
You know, I just wanted us to have fun

13:34.509 --> 13:36.060
and not have to worry about anything.

13:38.413 --> 13:40.848
We can.

13:43.707 --> 13:45.309
Tasha and I used to
do this all the time.

13:45.459 --> 13:46.993
These things always have too much food

13:47.044 --> 13:48.895
and they don't know
half the guests anyways.

13:48.963 --> 13:51.814
We came to this town so we
didn't have to be us, right?

13:51.882 --> 13:52.832
Yeah.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.367
Let's have fun with it.

13:54.435 --> 13:56.853
I'll be Sara, the bride's
very distant cousin

13:56.937 --> 13:58.588
from Cleveland, like, way distant.

13:58.656 --> 14:00.339
And... and you can be John.

14:00.391 --> 14:02.375
You know the groom from, uh...

14:02.443 --> 14:04.227
- Summer camp.
- Perfect.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.312
You like arm wrestling and-and cabins

14:06.363 --> 14:08.314
- and pontoon boats.
- Pontoon boats?

14:08.365 --> 14:10.233
What? I never went to summer camp.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.902
Because Sara spent her
summers practicing the cello.

14:12.987 --> 14:14.304
Hmm.

15:26.944 --> 15:28.861
Yo. Hey, you guys know

15:28.929 --> 15:30.179
your front door is propped open, right?

15:30.247 --> 15:31.397
Pizza guy's coming.

15:34.438 --> 15:34.899
W... what the...

15:35.002 --> 15:36.369
Mamma Mia!

15:36.420 --> 15:37.403
Every time someone sings,

15:37.455 --> 15:38.455
we got to chug.

15:38.539 --> 15:39.572
Grab a can.

15:39.623 --> 15:41.107
Pierce Brosnan has a number coming up.

15:42.293 --> 15:43.259
What's...

15:43.327 --> 15:46.062
Baze's girlfriend found
another guy to hold her purse.

15:46.130 --> 15:47.197
Thought we had a connection.

15:47.264 --> 15:48.982
Dude, by the time we
hit "Dancing Queen",

15:49.049 --> 15:51.151
you'll be too hammered to
remember what's-her-name's name.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.635
Emma.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.670
Wow.

15:53.737 --> 15:54.938
Well, I'm starting to feel

15:55.005 --> 15:56.189
real good about my life.

15:56.257 --> 15:57.807
Guys...

15:57.892 --> 15:59.359
It's Saturday night,

15:59.426 --> 16:00.560
you're watching a musical.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.712
You're a bunch of single dudes;

16:02.780 --> 16:03.410
you should be tearing it up.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.141
'Cause I'm telling you,
before you know it,

16:05.225 --> 16:07.059
you're gonna be eating
bad Pesto pasta dinners

16:07.111 --> 16:09.011
and sitting in couples therapy.

16:09.079 --> 16:10.329
And you...

16:10.397 --> 16:12.648
You have been going out
with Emma for, like, what,

16:12.716 --> 16:14.450
two weeks? You're gonna
let her ruin your weekend?

16:14.518 --> 16:15.701
Come on, man!

16:15.769 --> 16:17.203
Get off your asses! Let's have a,

16:17.270 --> 16:19.438
let's have a
balls-to-the-wall guys' night.

16:19.490 --> 16:21.040
Whoa, what about balls?

16:21.107 --> 16:22.942
I thought we were going to dinner.

16:23.010 --> 16:24.627
Eh, look, dinner's off.

16:24.711 --> 16:27.780
I need a break from all the
yapping and honesty exercises.

16:27.848 --> 16:28.764
And plumbers.

16:28.832 --> 16:29.749
Exactly, Baze.

16:29.817 --> 16:30.750
Come on, get up.

16:30.818 --> 16:32.084
Seriously, let's...

16:33.720 --> 16:36.834
Listen, I want you, tonight,
just to forget about women.

16:36.902 --> 16:39.053
'Cause tonight,

16:39.138 --> 16:40.304
we're getting back to our roots.

16:40.372 --> 16:43.091
Tonight, we are beer-drinking,

16:43.175 --> 16:46.043
knuckle-dragging, hairy-backed men.

16:46.111 --> 16:48.596
Tonight is guys' night!

16:48.680 --> 16:49.597
Yeah!

16:52.601 --> 16:54.102
Hey, just get out of here.

16:54.186 --> 16:55.219
No chicks allowed.

16:55.270 --> 16:57.488
No chicks, not on guys' night!

17:11.853 --> 17:12.770
Hey.

17:12.854 --> 17:14.588
Hey. You owe me a steak.

17:14.638 --> 17:17.808
Ryan dumped me to have
guys' night with Baze.

17:17.892 --> 17:19.810
He said he needed a break.

17:19.894 --> 17:21.528
Something about women being emotional

17:21.596 --> 17:22.913
and yappy.

17:22.981 --> 17:24.665
Yappy? No, I was not being yappy.

17:24.733 --> 17:25.949
Our therapist said that
we should be honest.

17:26.017 --> 17:27.768
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:27.836 --> 17:28.769
That's why you're hacking

17:28.837 --> 17:30.020
into his e-mail?

17:30.121 --> 17:31.805
You know what,
if I knew Julia's last name,

17:31.873 --> 17:33.841
I would just Google-stalk her,
like a normal person.

17:34.976 --> 17:36.610
I will give you $100

17:36.678 --> 17:39.096
if you tell me everything
you know about her.

17:39.164 --> 17:40.947
Mm-mm. No, no.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.649
I told you, I'm not getting involved.

17:42.717 --> 17:44.618
Look, Ryan could be into
midget transvestite hookers,

17:44.686 --> 17:47.471
and you wouldn't hear it from me.

17:47.555 --> 17:48.889
You're right.

17:48.956 --> 17:51.258
It is not fair to put you
in that position.

17:51.326 --> 17:52.904
Thank you.

17:52.977 --> 17:54.928
We should go out.

17:54.979 --> 17:57.014
We should go out,
we should have a few drinks

17:57.098 --> 17:59.149
and just, you know,
get to know each other better.

17:59.234 --> 18:00.433
Why? You hate me.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.001
Uh, no, I don't hate you.

18:02.670 --> 18:05.022
I just don't really know
you well enough to like you.

18:05.106 --> 18:06.573
Oh, come on.

18:06.641 --> 18:08.108
Drinks on me.

18:08.159 --> 18:09.660
Fine.

18:09.744 --> 18:11.829
If you're buying, I'm consuming.

18:11.913 --> 18:14.048
Well, then I'm buying.

18:23.124 --> 18:24.208
Yeah, me, too!

18:24.292 --> 18:25.509
You sure it's your speed?

18:25.593 --> 18:26.710
They don't serve cougar juice.

18:26.795 --> 18:28.662
Oh, you know that Chardonnay
crap that you drink.

18:28.713 --> 18:29.680
Oh.

18:29.748 --> 18:30.997
Excuse me. Hi.

18:31.049 --> 18:32.999
Um, can we get, uh,

18:33.051 --> 18:34.701
two shots, please?
Something strong.

18:34.769 --> 18:35.836
Okay.

18:39.557 --> 18:42.226
Here's to sisterhood, honesty,

18:42.310 --> 18:43.694
and, uh,

18:43.778 --> 18:46.263
people's sisters being honest.

18:49.701 --> 18:51.852
Get your drink on!

18:51.903 --> 18:53.570
Drink! Drink! Drink!

18:53.655 --> 18:56.407
Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

18:56.491 --> 18:57.991
Oh!

18:58.042 --> 18:59.543
Ah, no worries.

18:59.611 --> 19:00.744
I got a stain stick.

19:00.829 --> 19:01.567
A stain stick?

19:01.658 --> 19:02.975
It's guys' night, Nancy.

19:03.026 --> 19:04.260
Exactly.

19:04.328 --> 19:05.695
Men don't say sorry for spilling beer.

19:05.762 --> 19:07.530
Men don't apologize for anything.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.015
True. Just like you never apologized

19:09.082 --> 19:10.316
for bumping uglies with Cate.

19:13.259 --> 19:14.469
Too far?

19:15.728 --> 19:17.436
I am sorry about that.

19:17.506 --> 19:18.656
I... I owe you one.

19:18.707 --> 19:20.425
Eh, I'm past it.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.877
Which is another great thing about men.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.162
They move past stuff.

19:24.229 --> 19:25.630
They don't feel the need to

19:25.697 --> 19:26.681
dwell on details.

19:26.749 --> 19:27.665
Right on, man.

19:27.716 --> 19:28.966
'Cause, you know, I don't,

19:29.034 --> 19:29.378
I don't need to know

19:29.379 --> 19:31.356
who this guy is that Emma's dating

19:31.423 --> 19:33.107
or how they met.

19:33.175 --> 19:34.208
I mean...

19:34.293 --> 19:36.010
Do you think it was the camping trip?

19:36.078 --> 19:38.546
'Cause there was that one
chaperone with the man boobs.

19:38.614 --> 19:39.964
Stop. Look,

19:40.015 --> 19:41.282
you don't need to know this stuff, okay?

19:41.350 --> 19:42.550
'Cause, I mean, it's just gonna put

19:42.634 --> 19:44.302
stuff in your head that
doesn't help anyone.

19:44.353 --> 19:46.837
Besides, tonight is about men.

19:46.889 --> 19:48.723
There is no Cate and no Emma.

19:52.444 --> 19:53.361
Hello.

19:53.445 --> 19:55.646
Sorry to bother you on guys' night,
but we have a situation.

19:55.697 --> 19:57.398
Okay, so Cate tried to booze me up

19:57.483 --> 19:59.617
to talk about Julia,
but seeing as how I have

19:59.684 --> 20:01.685
the tolerance of a linebacker,
it kind of backfired,

20:01.686 --> 20:03.565
and I have a feeling

20:03.566 --> 20:05.435
she's a sloppy drunk, which isn't

20:05.436 --> 20:07.254
gonna work with my puke phobia.

20:08.715 --> 20:10.636
Is it hot in here or is it me?!

20:10.994 --> 20:12.417
It's me!

20:13.415 --> 20:13.981
Wild bar.

20:13.982 --> 20:15.138
You might want to get down here.

20:28.747 --> 20:29.531
Hey.

20:29.981 --> 20:31.024
Maybe we should go out.

20:32.346 --> 20:34.380
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

20:34.993 --> 20:36.498
Yeah! Let me go change.

20:36.929 --> 20:37.893
Why did you say

20:37.894 --> 20:39.507
that you were an Olympic skater?

20:39.508 --> 20:42.757
'Cause how often do you get to
be an olympic level ice skater?

20:42.795 --> 20:45.166
I... I still can't believe you
told the father of the bride

20:45.167 --> 20:46.100
that we have a wolfhound.

20:46.101 --> 20:47.756
No, it makes sense that we have a dog,

20:47.757 --> 20:49.372
since we met at a dog park.

20:49.401 --> 20:51.986
Yes, but I only pretended to have a dog

20:51.987 --> 20:53.323
so that I could meet you.

20:54.758 --> 20:56.038
Today was amazing.

20:56.948 --> 20:58.612
I'm sorry our date has to end.

21:01.854 --> 21:04.894
Uh, please tell me that
that's not the water taxi.

21:05.502 --> 21:06.702
Sorry, kid.

21:07.346 --> 21:08.434
Looks like you missed it.

21:08.481 --> 21:09.170
No, no, no!

21:09.172 --> 21:10.355
Wait! Wait!

21:11.242 --> 21:12.186
Wait!

21:12.493 --> 21:14.263
Listen, sir, we need to be on that boat.

21:14.264 --> 21:15.574
Okay, when is the next one?

21:16.224 --> 21:17.023
Tomorrow morning.

21:30.599 --> 21:31.891
Eaea please, Tasha.

21:32.971 --> 21:34.171
Look, I need you to give

21:34.310 --> 21:36.022
your credit card number to the hotel.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.389
They said if you can vouch
for us and give them your info,

21:38.390 --> 21:39.278
then they'll let us stay.

21:39.279 --> 21:41.216
Lux, that credit card
is for emergencies,

21:41.217 --> 21:43.010
not so you can hook
up with your teacher.

21:43.391 --> 21:44.775
What if Cate sees the charge?

21:44.776 --> 21:45.741
As soon as we get back,

21:45.762 --> 21:47.209
Eric can move the charge to his card.

21:47.210 --> 21:48.916
And I... I already called
Cate and told her

21:48.917 --> 21:50.125
that I was crashing at your place,

21:50.126 --> 21:52.158
so she'll never know, I... I swear.

21:53.162 --> 21:54.154
She better not.

21:56.388 --> 21:57.348
Thank you.

21:59.983 --> 22:02.504
Yes! This is what I am talking about.

22:02.505 --> 22:04.602
Guys' night. Do you smell that?

22:04.704 --> 22:07.439
It is the smell of sweat, of freedom...

22:08.187 --> 22:09.548
of possibilities.

22:10.264 --> 22:11.559
Did my bar smell like this?

22:11.702 --> 22:13.494
You mean like urine with a hint of beer?

22:13.514 --> 22:14.856
Your place didn't draw the crowd

22:14.857 --> 22:16.321
to brew this scent.

22:16.322 --> 22:17.265
Forget the smell.

22:17.266 --> 22:18.642
Check out the talent.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.718
I see a lot of thongs
and lower back tattoos.

22:20.719 --> 22:21.965
I... I... I like our chances.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.126
I'm uncomfortable.

22:23.127 --> 22:25.870
Don't... don't these women
have any self-respect?

22:26.223 --> 22:29.565
All right, she's a deep
innie and she's drunk.

22:29.566 --> 22:31.613
Who's up for a challenge?

22:31.943 --> 22:32.805
Cate?

22:33.821 --> 22:35.871
Cate's here? Come on.

22:35.872 --> 22:37.280
What happened to guys' night?

22:37.498 --> 22:38.954
What always happens with guys' night.

22:39.302 --> 22:40.214
Girls ruin it.

22:43.146 --> 22:43.882
Hey.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.081
You mind?

22:45.229 --> 22:48.111
- Get up. Get up. What? What?
- Come on.

22:51.062 --> 22:51.643
Come on.

22:51.644 --> 22:53.482
Let's get you home before
you do something you regret.

22:53.549 --> 22:55.517
You know, Ryan, I've already
done things I regret,

22:55.518 --> 22:56.910
and I have told you about them.

22:57.332 --> 23:00.163
And with whom I have done them.

23:00.824 --> 23:01.511
Whom.

23:02.310 --> 23:03.109
Whom, you know.

23:03.110 --> 23:04.334
All right, yeah, I get it. I get it.

23:04.354 --> 23:06.972
You know, your NBF, the guy
that you go camping with

23:06.973 --> 23:10.193
and you... you...
you drink beers with, right,

23:10.194 --> 23:11.494
without all the yap-yap.

23:11.495 --> 23:12.350
Cate, let's go home.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.109
- Come on.
- No. Listen, if you don't tell me

23:14.110 --> 23:15.039
about Julia...

23:16.855 --> 23:18.454
I'm just going to go on to plan B,

23:18.977 --> 23:20.534
which is going on

23:20.535 --> 23:23.250
a jag of humiliation
and self-destruction

23:23.251 --> 23:24.163
until you do.

23:40.654 --> 23:43.790
This is really, really wrong.

23:45.654 --> 23:47.225
We're not doing anything

23:47.226 --> 23:49.723
other than breathing and not moving.

23:50.447 --> 23:51.816
Except spending the night together

23:51.817 --> 23:53.530
in a hotel under assumed names.

23:53.682 --> 23:54.531
There's that.

24:00.270 --> 24:02.613
Lux, I don't want to be hot and cold,

24:02.614 --> 24:05.733
so, uh, don't think
that's what I'm doing.

24:06.316 --> 24:07.292
Eric...

24:07.439 --> 24:08.286
No.

24:09.795 --> 24:12.171
As a guy that likes you

24:12.172 --> 24:14.140
and wants to spend every
minute I can with you,

24:14.763 --> 24:16.232
missing that ferry
was the greatest thing

24:16.233 --> 24:17.162
that could happen.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.223
But as the guy who's
supposed to be responsible,

24:21.224 --> 24:22.966
who's supposed to be
looking out for you...

24:27.591 --> 24:28.744
Lux, I'm your teacher.

24:31.431 --> 24:33.153
We can't pretend to be other people

24:33.154 --> 24:37.363
and lie to your
parents, lie to ourselves

24:37.895 --> 24:40.600
and escape to an island every
weekend, just to be together.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.019
We don't have a future together.

24:51.394 --> 24:52.770
We're not John and Sara.

24:54.346 --> 24:56.201
At the end of the day,
we're still ourselves.

24:57.749 --> 24:58.550
I know.

25:00.082 --> 25:00.978
Do you?

25:07.105 --> 25:08.177
Think about it, Lux.

25:09.282 --> 25:11.073
Is this really ever going
to be enough for you?

25:13.561 --> 25:15.850
'Cause the last person's heart
I want to break is yours.

25:33.929 --> 25:34.745
You.

25:37.326 --> 25:37.981
What?

25:37.982 --> 25:38.863
Guys' night.

25:40.202 --> 25:41.496
You tell me to forget about Emma,

25:41.497 --> 25:44.714
and you drag us down
here to chase down Cate?

25:45.446 --> 25:47.190
Yeah, well, it's different.

25:47.482 --> 25:49.450
I can't forget about Cate.
I married her.

25:49.570 --> 25:50.197
Well, you know,

25:50.198 --> 25:51.910
I can't forget about Emma, either.

25:57.026 --> 25:57.922
You know what?

25:58.894 --> 26:02.194
I think that maybe being beer-drinking,

26:02.203 --> 26:04.890
hairy-backed knuckle
draggers wasn't the best idea.

26:05.598 --> 26:06.648
I don't want a guys' night.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.536
I don't want to be at wild bar.

26:09.149 --> 26:11.277
I want to know what the
hell is going on with Emma.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.029
I mean, if she never
wants to see me again,

26:14.030 --> 26:15.577
if she thinks the whole
thing is a big joke

26:15.578 --> 26:18.426
because she thinks...
she thinks that I'm a big joke,

26:18.537 --> 26:19.786
I just want to know the truth.

26:21.787 --> 26:23.162
It's just going to make it worse, man.

26:23.223 --> 26:23.898
I'm telling you.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.746
I can't feel any worse than I do.

26:29.637 --> 26:31.734
And I bet the same thing goes for Cate.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.474
She can't feel any worse
than she does right now.

26:38.086 --> 26:38.854
Come here.

26:52.557 --> 26:56.332
I'm drunk, I just lost
my bra in strip pool,

26:56.333 --> 26:57.875
and now you want to talk?

26:57.876 --> 26:58.948
That's great.

27:01.306 --> 27:02.762
Julia and I worked together.

27:02.882 --> 27:03.633
That's how we met.

27:05.767 --> 27:06.916
We started dating.

27:07.323 --> 27:08.216
I moved in.

27:08.217 --> 27:10.122
Three years later, I moved out.

27:11.685 --> 27:12.693
Three years?

27:13.341 --> 27:15.100
You lived with her for three years?

27:19.301 --> 27:21.462
Well, why did it end?

27:23.506 --> 27:26.161
Because I proposed and she said no.

27:28.606 --> 27:29.969
She said she didn't believe in marriage.

27:29.970 --> 27:32.309
Maybe she didn't believe
in marriage to me.

27:32.310 --> 27:33.477
She didn't want to marry you,

27:33.478 --> 27:34.421
so you... you, what?

27:34.422 --> 27:35.238
You just...

27:37.242 --> 27:38.200
You settled for me?

27:38.201 --> 27:38.858
No.

27:39.243 --> 27:41.018
No, Cate, that's... that's not it.

27:42.157 --> 27:43.320
I mean, her ending it...

27:43.321 --> 27:44.778
That's... that's what led me to you.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.017
Are you over her?

27:49.554 --> 27:51.061
Yeah. I mean, I moved on. I married you.

27:51.062 --> 27:52.279
I chose you.

27:52.305 --> 27:54.097
That's not what I asked you.

27:55.885 --> 27:56.860
What I asked you

27:56.861 --> 28:00.030
is if you are 100% completely over her.

28:06.070 --> 28:07.149
No.

28:10.349 --> 28:11.837
Look, Cate, yes, I... I...

28:12.162 --> 28:13.492
I have feelings for Julia,

28:13.493 --> 28:15.381
but how is that different than Baze?

28:16.099 --> 28:18.970
I mean, you went to him
the night before our wedding.

28:18.971 --> 28:19.752
But you chose me.

28:19.753 --> 28:22.427
You and Julia... That is not
the same thing, okay?

28:22.428 --> 28:24.157
Because I told you about Baze.

28:26.429 --> 28:27.419
That is the difference.

28:27.420 --> 28:28.778
No, the difference is,

28:28.783 --> 28:30.150
I could deal with it.

28:30.151 --> 28:31.398
I've been dealing with it.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.101
That's the reason I wasn't honest.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.590
'Cause I knew you couldn't handle it.

28:35.802 --> 28:37.514
Cate, where are you going?

28:38.026 --> 28:39.354
Getting a cab.

28:39.794 --> 28:41.005
Come on. I'll go with you.

28:41.006 --> 28:43.768
No! I am going home alone!

28:59.879 --> 29:00.773
Emma!

29:01.207 --> 29:02.358
Hey, Emma!

29:03.506 --> 29:04.977
I need to talk to you.

29:06.413 --> 29:08.445
Look, I know that you
think this relationship

29:08.446 --> 29:12.990
is just fun and sex in cars
and buses, but it's not.

29:13.394 --> 29:14.417
Not to me.

29:16.169 --> 29:18.590
I care about you,
and I want to be with you,

29:18.591 --> 29:20.529
and I don't want you to
be with any other guys.

29:20.530 --> 29:23.193
And I don't know who this other dude is,

29:23.194 --> 29:24.746
but... but...

29:25.246 --> 29:26.142
but...

29:27.244 --> 29:28.810
but I want you to know that...

29:31.406 --> 29:32.311
What?

29:33.154 --> 29:34.450
Oh, crap.

29:35.654 --> 29:37.862
There is no other dude.

29:38.224 --> 29:40.203
This is my son Sam.

29:42.794 --> 29:45.467
You need to leave now.

30:11.511 --> 30:12.311
What?

30:13.110 --> 30:14.804
A hotel room charge?

30:14.805 --> 30:16.307
No, no. That's not right.

30:16.308 --> 30:18.742
I got that credit card
for a 16-year-old.

30:19.509 --> 30:20.694
Oh, crap.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.989
Can you walk any faster?

30:23.990 --> 30:24.641
I'm sorry,

30:24.642 --> 30:27.154
but these damn pants are
cutting off my circulation.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.753
Geez, how small are you?

30:28.754 --> 30:30.530
Are you seriously giving
me attitude right now?

30:30.618 --> 30:32.444
I just ran to the dock to save your ass,

30:32.445 --> 30:33.902
so I wouldn't bitch if I were you.

30:33.918 --> 30:34.655
Okay.

30:36.589 --> 30:37.357
Well,

30:38.021 --> 30:39.318
good morning, kiddos.

30:39.514 --> 30:40.411
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:40.994 --> 30:42.470
Hey. So, uh, you're lying

30:42.471 --> 30:44.464
and sneaking around behind my back?

30:46.923 --> 30:47.898
Where have you been?

30:48.440 --> 30:50.253
We just went to go get some food.

30:50.254 --> 30:51.714
No, no, no. I mean last night.

30:51.715 --> 30:53.721
You know, the credit card
company called, and apparently,

30:53.722 --> 30:56.458
there was a hotel room
charge last night in Astoria.

30:59.082 --> 31:01.082
One of you better
start talking right now.

31:03.549 --> 31:04.478
Uh...

31:04.515 --> 31:05.620
"Uh..."

31:05.788 --> 31:06.678
Um...

31:06.679 --> 31:08.567
Uh, get in the car. Let's go.

31:08.619 --> 31:09.358
What? What?

31:09.359 --> 31:10.773
Let's go. Where are we going?

31:10.774 --> 31:11.805
We're going to go to the hotel.

31:11.806 --> 31:13.146
If you can't remember who you were with,

31:13.147 --> 31:14.701
maybe someone at the hotel does.

31:14.702 --> 31:16.014
Tasha, get in the car.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.211
Seriously, what are we doing?

31:22.633 --> 31:23.994
We're going to go to Astoria.

31:24.276 --> 31:26.819
Look, I... I hoped that you
had a better plan than that.

31:27.257 --> 31:29.182
Look, if Cate and Baze
find out that Eric and I

31:29.183 --> 31:30.607
were in a hotel last night...

31:30.946 --> 31:31.869
Yeah, so what?

31:31.870 --> 31:33.437
You'll just find another boyfriend.

31:33.438 --> 31:36.108
Tash, he could lose his job. Or worse.

31:36.109 --> 31:38.926
Okay, I don't really care
about Mr. Daniels, Lux.

31:40.859 --> 31:44.261
Okay, well... What about me?

31:44.262 --> 31:45.414
Do you care about me?

31:46.350 --> 31:48.158
I've never felt this way before.

31:49.323 --> 31:51.707
Not in my entire life.

31:53.986 --> 31:55.891
Don't mess this up for me, Tash.

31:56.846 --> 31:57.886
Please.

31:59.899 --> 32:01.578
What the hell am I supposed to say?

32:03.162 --> 32:04.778
Okay. All right. All right.

32:05.411 --> 32:07.202
We stay calm, united front.

32:08.538 --> 32:10.818
We drive to the docks, and we
hope that one of them cracks

32:10.819 --> 32:11.939
before we get there.

32:13.255 --> 32:14.007
Okay.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.797
Okay, you guys, we're serious.

32:31.999 --> 32:33.184
I'm going to start this car.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.971
I... I am starting this car

32:36.972 --> 32:38.282
in three seconds.

32:38.735 --> 32:39.598
One...

32:40.791 --> 32:41.768
Two...

32:43.798 --> 32:44.966
Three. All right.

32:45.054 --> 32:46.237
- Uh...
- Okay, wait.

32:46.238 --> 32:47.038
Wait.

32:53.762 --> 32:55.213
I ran into this guy we used to know,

32:55.214 --> 32:57.935
and he told me about this
rave thing in Astoria.

32:59.847 --> 33:00.983
I wanted to go.

33:01.585 --> 33:03.378
Lux didn't, but she covered for me.

33:03.634 --> 33:05.665
And I actually stayed at that hotel.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.446
Do you have any idea how stupid that is?

33:09.447 --> 33:10.487
It's really stupid.

33:10.615 --> 33:12.135
- Sorry.
- Yeah, me, too.

33:13.880 --> 33:15.798
You're gonna have to give
me that credit card back.

33:15.799 --> 33:18.021
And we are gonna have to
figure out a different way

33:18.022 --> 33:19.125
with some new rules.

33:19.126 --> 33:20.935
I swear, you don't have
to worry about me.

33:20.936 --> 33:22.649
Um, yeah, I do...

33:24.413 --> 33:26.068
Okay? So there's gonna be no more

33:26.069 --> 33:27.824
going over to Jones's house.

33:27.851 --> 33:28.713
- What?!
- No more basketball.

33:28.714 --> 33:29.576
What?

33:29.630 --> 33:31.819
Yeah, and from now on,
you'll be coming home

33:31.820 --> 33:34.442
every day after school
because, apparently,

33:34.454 --> 33:36.418
I cannot trust you the
way I thought I could.

33:36.419 --> 33:37.621
Okay, Cate...

33:37.622 --> 33:38.374
Lux.

33:42.489 --> 33:43.561
You messed up big-time.

33:43.562 --> 33:45.161
I really hope that it was worth it.

33:48.470 --> 33:49.510
Yeah, me, too.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.978
Wanted an emergency
I think meeting on a Sunday.

34:07.690 --> 34:10.681
Presumably it wasn't so we would
all sit in silence for the hour.

34:11.781 --> 34:13.637
Your honesty exercise sucked.

34:13.638 --> 34:15.757
That's because she turned
it into an inquisition.

34:15.949 --> 34:18.014
She wouldn't let up until
I told her about Julia.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.562
Yeah, how he wanted to marry her,

34:19.563 --> 34:21.373
how he's not even really over her.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.879
Okay, yeah, it's not that simple.

34:23.213 --> 34:27.101
It's interesting...
Julia and Cate share similar qualities.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.206
Julia didn't want to marry you.

34:29.855 --> 34:31.427
Cate gave you plenty of signals

34:31.428 --> 34:33.315
that she didn't want to get married.

34:33.502 --> 34:36.110
Uh, yeah, she hit me when I proposed.

34:36.601 --> 34:38.212
Oh, and she slept with someone else.

34:38.213 --> 34:39.797
So why did you push so hard

34:39.870 --> 34:41.246
to get Cate to marry you?

34:41.279 --> 34:42.918
Why didn't you just
take no for an answer

34:42.918 --> 34:44.166
like you did with Julia?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.556
I pushed to marry Cate
because I, I loved her.

34:47.558 --> 34:49.175
I didn't want to lose her.

34:49.185 --> 34:50.521
That's your honest answer?

34:57.081 --> 34:58.314
Maybe I, uh,

34:58.478 --> 35:00.205
maybe I kind of pushed her to...

35:02.433 --> 35:03.522
to say yes.

35:06.003 --> 35:10.482
To feel better...
To get over Julia saying no.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.777
All I'm saying is

35:12.778 --> 35:14.913
maybe I rushed you.

35:14.914 --> 35:16.418
I rushed us.

35:19.423 --> 35:21.517
For whatever screwed-up reasons I had.

35:24.166 --> 35:25.766
Well, that makes me feel really good.

35:27.746 --> 35:28.547
Cate...

35:29.599 --> 35:31.885
Cate, this is a good thing,

35:32.542 --> 35:33.709
I promise you.

35:34.114 --> 35:37.106
Figuring out why you both
chose to do what you did

35:37.466 --> 35:39.930
will allow the relationship
to move forward.

35:41.094 --> 35:42.086
How about you?

35:43.073 --> 35:45.494
You spent your whole life saying
you didn't want to get married.

35:45.495 --> 35:47.206
Why did you agree to marry Ryan?

35:49.538 --> 35:50.643
I don't know. Um...

35:53.772 --> 35:55.213
You're asking me all these questions

35:55.214 --> 35:59.422
and I don't even really have
the space to figure them out.

36:01.479 --> 36:02.223
You know, I mean,

36:02.224 --> 36:04.603
we live together and
we work together and...

36:05.265 --> 36:07.458
Would you both consider
a little time apart?

36:08.458 --> 36:09.473
What? No, no.

36:09.474 --> 36:10.563
Like a separation?

36:11.350 --> 36:12.086
Ryan,

36:12.087 --> 36:14.233
if you could find
someplace else to stay,

36:14.234 --> 36:15.563
just for a little while,

36:16.875 --> 36:19.502
it might give Cate the
emotional space she needs.

36:36.740 --> 36:37.797
Math let me in.

36:42.088 --> 36:43.496
Should we talk?

36:55.436 --> 36:57.007
How could you not say anything

36:58.115 --> 36:59.299
about having a kid?

37:02.023 --> 37:02.839
Um...

37:05.321 --> 37:09.910
Sam hasn't lived with me
since he was 11.

37:11.978 --> 37:14.971
Ugh, he was getting
into trouble at school...

37:17.754 --> 37:19.548
Well, you know, I just didn't
know what else to do,

37:19.549 --> 37:20.589
so, you know, when he asked,

37:20.590 --> 37:23.270
I said he could go live
with his dad, my ex.

37:26.047 --> 37:28.847
But you know, his dad really
wasn't much of a dad, so...

37:30.659 --> 37:35.228
we, uh, sent him off to boarding school,

37:35.229 --> 37:40.417
and, uh, he got
arrested for selling pot,

37:40.418 --> 37:44.910
and then we sent him off
to some 30-day rehab place,

37:44.911 --> 37:46.629
but he got kicked out of there, too.

37:46.630 --> 37:47.606
And, um...

37:49.127 --> 37:53.446
His dad dropped him off
at my doorstep yesterday...

37:54.398 --> 37:55.520
out of the blue.

37:59.286 --> 38:00.086
Okay.

38:01.582 --> 38:05.534
You know, the whole
kid/doorstep thing...

38:06.222 --> 38:08.589
I get. Been there.

38:10.122 --> 38:11.594
That I could live with.

38:12.834 --> 38:13.997
You and another dude,

38:13.998 --> 38:15.887
now that's... You know, I can't,

38:15.938 --> 38:17.013
I can't deal with that.

38:17.014 --> 38:22.151
But I'm... I'm serious
about you, about us.

38:25.454 --> 38:26.222
Me, too.

38:30.450 --> 38:33.829
So do you have any
more secrets to tell me?

38:33.830 --> 38:35.750
Anything else you want
to get off your chest?

38:37.651 --> 38:39.395
I think I'm falling in love with you.

38:42.150 --> 38:43.414
I think I am, too.

38:45.525 --> 38:46.481
With you, not me,

38:46.482 --> 38:48.102
'cause that would be weird, you know?

38:48.103 --> 38:49.710
Falling in love with myself.

38:49.711 --> 38:51.497
Right. I think a little less talking,

38:51.498 --> 38:53.437
a little more employee relations.

38:53.438 --> 38:54.366
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:12.162 --> 39:14.035
It's not like I have
anything else to lose.

39:14.742 --> 39:15.606
Tasha...

39:21.479 --> 39:22.871
She's upset.

39:24.035 --> 39:24.947
Yeah.

39:27.326 --> 39:28.239
I mean...

39:30.337 --> 39:31.987
She's risking a lot for us...

39:34.810 --> 39:38.185
and we are, too.

39:40.107 --> 39:41.211
Eric...

39:42.970 --> 39:44.266
For me, it's worth it.

39:45.616 --> 39:47.374
Beyond worth it.

39:50.007 --> 39:52.038
I thought about what you asked me...

39:53.167 --> 39:54.559
If this was enough for me.

39:56.111 --> 39:58.490
And I know that we don't
have islands and weddings

39:58.491 --> 40:00.276
and we aren't John and Sara.

40:04.974 --> 40:07.391
But I don't care about the future.

40:09.635 --> 40:10.877
That's the thing about me.

40:10.878 --> 40:13.462
All my life I... I could never
count on the future

40:13.463 --> 40:16.326
because I was too busy
trying to keep what I had

40:16.327 --> 40:18.071
in the present from disappearing.

40:20.965 --> 40:22.790
I don't want you to go anywhere.

40:25.169 --> 40:28.883
'Cause what I have right now is you.

40:31.254 --> 40:32.806
What I want right now...

40:35.062 --> 40:35.863
Is you.

41:12.880 --> 41:13.920
Ryan.

41:16.042 --> 41:17.258
You still owe me one.
