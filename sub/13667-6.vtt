<i>- Tonight on st. Elsewhere.
- Okay. How long?</i>

00:06.233 --> 00:08.502
- Thirty-Five minutes.
- Give it up.

00:08.568 --> 00:11.305
<i>Two, three--
[ steady BEEP ]</i>

00:11.371 --> 00:13.106
<i>[ laughing ]
Somethin' funny?</i>

00:13.173 --> 00:15.943
- No, sir.
- Mr. Roecklein, a young lady
just died in here!

00:16.009 --> 00:18.245
You have a rotten
sense of timing.
You know that?

00:18.312 --> 00:20.981
It's going,
"Lub-Dub, lub-Dub."
No, no, Ehrlich.

00:21.048 --> 00:23.517
If there's a murmur,
it would be, "Lub-Schtub,
lub-Schtub."

00:23.584 --> 00:25.519
Oh, I see.
"Lub-Schtub."

00:25.586 --> 00:28.889
Don't you ever, ever
question my authority
again, lady,

00:28.956 --> 00:32.159
or I'll slam the door
so hard on you, you won't
know what hit you.

00:32.225 --> 00:34.628
You're a good doctor,
but you're an inadequate woman.

00:34.695 --> 00:38.599
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
You've got a cold heart.

00:38.665 --> 00:41.168
You can have $300
for a new beeper,

00:41.235 --> 00:43.971
but we can't get $20
for a diaper service.

00:44.037 --> 00:46.473
I'm tired of it, Peter!
I'm just sick of it!

00:46.540 --> 00:49.643
Three people have died
with symptoms of legionnaires'.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.778
Donald would like to
close down the ward.

00:51.845 --> 00:55.382
I'm not a doctor,
but don't you think closing it
down is a little extreme?

00:55.449 --> 00:57.317
No, I don't,
not if it's legionnaires'.

02:31.545 --> 02:34.181
I ask him what
the word "Impale" Means.

02:34.248 --> 02:37.951
He stuck this letter Opener
on his hand and said,
"Stick that sucker through."

02:38.018 --> 02:40.621
I gave it a good listen,
and it's going,
"Lub-Dub, lub-Dub."

02:40.687 --> 02:44.491
No, no, Ehrlich.
If there's a murmur, it would
be, "Lub-Schtub, lub-Schtub."

02:44.558 --> 02:47.794
Oh, I see. "Lub-Schtub."
Try to remember that,
will you?

02:47.861 --> 02:50.464
It could be the difference
between your patient
being alive or dead.

02:50.530 --> 02:54.701
If he's a c.O.P.D.-er,
you're gonna need a baseline
pulmonary function Test.

02:54.768 --> 02:57.571
Is he still giving you that
story about coughing up blood?
Mm-Hmm.

02:57.638 --> 03:02.643
Have pulmonary scope him
and check for lesions, then
get a biopsy with Brushings.

03:02.709 --> 03:07.314
<i>[ Beeping ]
never a dull moment.</i>

03:07.381 --> 03:09.316
Where's my--

03:09.383 --> 03:11.318
<i>[ Samuels ]
hmm?</i>

03:11.385 --> 03:15.055
I found this on the body
of a 78-year-Old patient.

03:15.122 --> 03:18.992
"Where are the dope fields?
The helicopters are green."

03:19.059 --> 03:22.262
He came down from C.C.U.
He was there for
four straight weeks.

03:22.329 --> 03:24.231
I.C.U. Psychosis.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.968
<i>Where are the dope fields?</i>

03:28.035 --> 03:31.038
There are some
calcified Granulomas
on his chest x-Ray.

03:31.104 --> 03:34.241
That means
the first thing we have
to worry About is C.A.

03:34.308 --> 03:37.110
Call Feldman
and have him bronched.
Excuse me.

03:39.379 --> 03:43.183
Hey, hey. I'm going down
to Chestnut hill reservoir
later, do some night fishing.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.352
You wanna come?
What are you,
high on vitamin "C"?

03:45.419 --> 03:47.421
Fishing's illegal
at Chestnut hill.

03:47.487 --> 03:49.456
I know that,
but everybody does it.

03:49.523 --> 03:52.559
Illegal, as in put you in
the same cell as son of Sam,
the Boston strangler,

03:52.626 --> 03:54.561
John Wilkes Booth.

03:54.628 --> 03:56.563
Come on.
Fishing's fun.

03:56.630 --> 03:59.633
Ehrlich, sitting on concrete,
holding a stick with a string
dangling in the water...

03:59.700 --> 04:03.370
and ducking into the woods
every time a cop car passes
is not fun.

04:03.437 --> 04:06.506
A cardiac arrest
in the middle of rem sleep--
That's fun.

04:06.573 --> 04:09.910
A wino with an e.E.G.
Of two Spikes-- That's fun.

04:09.977 --> 04:12.479
A little dalliance
in the on call room--

04:12.546 --> 04:15.215
Oh, wait a second.
I see. You have other plans.

04:15.282 --> 04:18.719
Uh-huh.
Mm-Hmm.
Cathy Martin, I presume.

04:21.755 --> 04:25.058
Oh, lucky for her,
I'm not pumpin' Iron.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.961
Yeah, well, my sister
had a midwife.

04:28.028 --> 04:31.198
Shirley,
this doctor's wife is not
gonna give birth at home.

04:31.265 --> 04:33.233
There were no problems
Whatsoever.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.435
Yeah, but still,

04:35.502 --> 04:38.672
I want Nina
to have the baby
in a hospital.

04:38.739 --> 04:41.208
I want her to have
the best care Possible.

04:41.275 --> 04:44.211
Jack, if you're so worried,
why don't you deliver
the baby yourself?

04:45.545 --> 04:48.482
Mrs. Weingrot could have
waited until Rounds.
Who?

04:48.548 --> 04:50.550
338. The woman
you woke me for.

04:50.617 --> 04:52.619
She complained
of stomach pains.

04:52.686 --> 04:55.989
Missing a bowel movement
is not an emergency.

04:58.525 --> 05:00.427
[ sighs ]

05:02.262 --> 05:05.232
did you look under it?
Well, come on!
Look under it!

05:07.501 --> 05:10.137
[ Chattering ]

05:10.203 --> 05:12.873
it isn't? Damn it!
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

05:12.940 --> 05:15.943
Yes, I looked in the cafeteria.
I looked in every inch
of this place.

05:16.009 --> 05:19.846
All right. It's $260.
I'll get the money.
I'll get the money.

05:19.913 --> 05:22.082
Peter.
Look, I gotta go now.

05:22.149 --> 05:25.152
Tell you what--
if you find it,
you call me, okay?

05:25.218 --> 05:27.220
Okay? Bye-Bye.

05:27.287 --> 05:29.823
Hell of a tumor board
this morning.
Yeah, I heard.

05:29.890 --> 05:32.726
Where were you?
Megan fell off a swing
in the playground.

05:32.793 --> 05:35.796
Oh, no.
Anything serious?
Yeah, it's always serious.

05:35.862 --> 05:39.199
It was funny as hell
this morning. Jackson gets up
and starts carrying on.

05:39.266 --> 05:42.035

Craig gets bent out
of shape and screams,

<i>"Because death Certificates
are written before

a radical neck.

No, Thanks.

to get a little sleep.

06:16.503 --> 06:20.507

around here, have you?
Oh, no. No beeper.

06:20.574 --> 06:22.476

Who's the attending?
Gannon, but he's
in surgery all day.

06:44.331 --> 06:46.333
I'm very worried
about her.
Why?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.569
Her name's
Francine Delgado.

06:48.635 --> 06:51.572
She, seven days ago,
had a MITRAL valve
replacement.

06:51.638 --> 06:53.574
What's her post-Op course
been like?

06:53.640 --> 06:55.642
It was excellent until
about 24 hours ago.

06:55.709 --> 06:59.379
She started vomiting,
having diarrhea. Her temperature
went through the roof.

06:59.446 --> 07:02.916
In the last few hours,
she's been coughing
without sputum Production.

07:02.983 --> 07:05.485
Hmm. Has she
been complaining
about any weakness?

07:05.552 --> 07:07.721
Yes, she has,
and I just don't
understand it.

07:07.788 --> 07:11.792
This is the first temp spike
and g.I. Distress she's had
since she came out of surgery.

07:11.858 --> 07:14.027
Will you see her?
Sure. Where is she?

07:14.094 --> 07:16.029
Follow me.

07:16.096 --> 07:19.266
I'm going down to x-Rays
right now to take a look
at it for you, okay?

07:19.333 --> 07:22.135
Good. Peter?
I can't talk right now.
I lost my beeper.

Mm-Hmm.

07:25.172 --> 07:27.674
Excuse me.

07:27.741 --> 07:31.144

of hair on him?
It's disgusting.

Now, mark,
he's only a kid.

Tomorrow Morning.

gonna run Very smoothly
without you though.

Nonsense. Between don westphall
and B.J. Cummings,
I have no worries.

You know, that Cummings kid
May be a good hospital
administrator,

07:49.229 --> 07:52.900
but sometimes he can be
a real hardnose.

07:52.966 --> 07:56.069
I don't like
people like that.

07:56.136 --> 07:59.473
You've caught an infection,
Francine, but it has nothing
to do with your operation.

I feel like I'm on fire.
I can't stop shaking.

08:02.976 --> 08:06.446

a urine for culture.

I'm a bourbon-Straight-up

use them to smoke pot?

09:55.889 --> 09:57.891
Yeah, so they don't
burn their fingers.

Necessity is the mother
of invention.

reach for one in an operation,

Do we have autopsies
on those two patients
that died of pneumonia?

11:03.257 --> 11:05.759
Perez and rothlein?
No, we didn't see
any reason to.

11:05.826 --> 11:09.630
Cause of death was
respiratory arrest--
Emphysema with complications.

11:09.696 --> 11:11.665
Oh.
What's up,

any features that might be
consistent with legionnaires'?

11:33.420 --> 11:36.523
I don't remember.
They went pretty fast. How are
you treating miss Delgado?

11:36.590 --> 11:38.792

- She came in with it.
Uh, food poisoning.

and whoever did it really
smashed in his chest.

right away?

Let's hope not.

12:40.187 --> 12:43.423
- And you think
it's legionnaires'.
- Possibly.

12:43.490 --> 12:46.059
Uh-Huh. Uh-huh.

12:46.126 --> 12:49.129
Have you checked with
the center for disease
control in atlanta?

12:49.196 --> 12:52.933
No, not yet.
We have a dieterle
down in pathology now.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.904
So we'll just have to wait
until the results come in.
I don't think that's very wise.

12:56.970 --> 12:59.773
Donald would like
to close down the ward.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.176
Ward 5 has 35 beds.

13:03.243 --> 13:05.245
Now, I'm not a doctor,

13:05.312 --> 13:08.949
but don't you think
closing it down is a little
extreme, premature?

13:09.016 --> 13:11.018
No, I don't,
not if it's legionnaires'.

13:11.084 --> 13:14.054
you see, there's a separate
air conditioner in there.

13:14.121 --> 13:17.724
Are you aware that we're due
for our quarterly census?

13:17.791 --> 13:20.761
Our state Subsidy is based
on the number of beds used.

13:20.827 --> 13:23.430
If we close down ward 5,
even for a couple of days,

13:23.497 --> 13:25.432
we'll lose
several thousand dollars.

13:25.499 --> 13:28.936
Three people have died
with symptoms of Legionnaires'.

13:29.002 --> 13:30.971
That's quite a coincidence.

13:31.038 --> 13:33.006
Were the patients
in good health?
No.

13:33.073 --> 13:36.376
Two of them were
elderly women with histories
of chronic respiratory disease.

13:36.443 --> 13:38.879
<i>The third had just come out
of open-Heart surgery,</i>

13:38.946 --> 13:41.882
but she was on ward 5
before the operation.

13:41.949 --> 13:44.985
There are a lot
of infections running loose
around a hospital.

13:45.052 --> 13:48.722
There were three million
cases of pneumonia
in the United States last year.

13:48.789 --> 13:51.992
One third of them
were of unknown origin.

13:52.059 --> 13:55.028
This is our
most recent report
on nosocomial infections.

13:56.663 --> 13:59.466
Were any of these people
on a respirator?
Two.

13:59.533 --> 14:04.104
Well, we have
hospital-Acquired pseudomonas
infections from a respirator,

14:04.171 --> 14:06.506
two methicillin-Resistant
staph infections...

14:06.573 --> 14:10.777
<i>and recently a run
of gram-Negative enteric
bacilli E. Coli klebsiella.</i>

14:10.844 --> 14:14.114
<i>They're not sensitive
to any of the standard
antibacterial drugs.</i>

14:14.181 --> 14:17.618
<i>They're not even sensitive
to the third-Generation
cephalosporins.</i>

14:17.684 --> 14:19.620
In each case--
I know.

14:19.686 --> 14:23.857
We isolate the patient,
put them on triple antibiotics
and hope that one hits,

14:23.924 --> 14:25.859
but we do not
close down a ward.

14:25.926 --> 14:28.228
No, we don't.

14:28.295 --> 14:32.266
<i>I think we should wait
for the dieterle
and the legionella titers.</i>

14:41.174 --> 14:45.445
We know
he checked out, Fiscus.
Was he "0" Or was he "Q"?

14:48.215 --> 14:50.350
"Q." Definite "Q."
[ Laughing ]

14:50.417 --> 14:52.853
Hey, Cathy.
Sit over here.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.689
What, with everybody?
What everybody?
Ehrlich? Come on.

14:55.756 --> 14:58.125
All right.
I'll get that. Here.

14:58.191 --> 15:00.761
Let's get you a chair.
[ Ehrlich ]
sit down.

15:00.827 --> 15:03.430
Enjoy.
Okay, where was I?
Oh, yeah.

15:03.497 --> 15:06.066
So I go over to the wife
and tell her she's a widow.

15:06.133 --> 15:09.269
She gets all upset
and says, "I knew he'd pull
something like that."

15:09.336 --> 15:13.707
and then she proceeds
to ask my advice in how to
spend the insurance money.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.478
Interesting
you should say that.

15:18.545 --> 15:22.749
The history
of the residency program is
quite fascinating Actually.

15:22.816 --> 15:25.819
As William Stewart Halstead,
the noted endocrinologist...
[ yawns ]

15:25.886 --> 15:28.622
and a close personal friend
of my father, once said--

15:28.689 --> 15:31.491
It's not
a psychological problem, V.J.

15:31.558 --> 15:34.361
No?
Mm-Mmm.
It's one of diction.

15:34.428 --> 15:38.065
You don't need a therapist,
you need a tutor.
Yes?

15:38.131 --> 15:40.801
Hmm. Sure.
Look, V.J.

15:40.867 --> 15:43.804
It's impossible to be witty
or charming or warm...

15:43.870 --> 15:45.872
if you don't speak
the language.

15:45.939 --> 15:49.343
No matter how smart you are,
it's interpreted
as being Stupid.

15:49.409 --> 15:51.345
Uh-Huh.

15:51.411 --> 15:55.649
He's going on and on
about how a certain patient died
of C.H.F. From mitral Stenosis.

15:55.716 --> 15:57.718
Talks
for about two hours.

15:57.784 --> 16:00.020
<i>When it's time for pathology
to give its findings,</i>

16:00.087 --> 16:04.591
a third-Year path resident
stands up, looks Frazier
right in the face...

16:04.658 --> 16:07.628
and says,
"the mitral valve
was perfectly normal."

16:07.694 --> 16:09.630
<i>Frazier gets totally
bent out of shape.</i>

16:09.696 --> 16:13.066
"I know
it was mitral stenosis!

16:13.133 --> 16:15.869
I heard the murmur.
I should know!"

16:15.936 --> 16:18.405
the resident
Holds up his hand.

16:18.472 --> 16:22.809
He's got the valve in a jar
and says to Frazier,

16:22.876 --> 16:25.779
"I have the valve.
Have you got the murmur?"

16:27.314 --> 16:29.983
<i>- It was perfect.
- That's great.</i>

16:30.050 --> 16:32.920
Dr. White?
Your patient, Mr. Andover?
You prescribed methicillin.

16:32.986 --> 16:37.391
Yes.
Are you aware that the man
is allergic to penicillin?

16:37.457 --> 16:39.860
The last thing he needs
is to go into
an anaphylactic reaction.

16:41.461 --> 16:45.832
I can't believe I did that.
I've been really preoccupied
Lately.

16:45.899 --> 16:48.535
Try to concentrate
on your patients, doctor.

16:48.602 --> 16:51.471
This is going down
on your evaluation.

16:57.544 --> 17:02.883
<i>Calling every time a patient has
constipation or an I.V. Pops out
isn't normal procedure.</i>

17:02.950 --> 17:06.185
I mean, loceff has never been
overly friendly or open.

17:06.252 --> 17:10.590
I always chalked it up to
a difference in personalities,
but this is just getting worse.

17:10.656 --> 17:14.261
Why is loceff giving you
such a hard time?
I don't know.

17:14.328 --> 17:16.262
Obviously
she resents you.

17:16.329 --> 17:20.434
I mean, look, face it--
sisterhood, togetherness--
That's fine up to a point.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.669
The bottom line is
you're a doctor,

17:22.736 --> 17:24.805
she's a nurse.

17:24.871 --> 17:27.441
<i>My first day in the O.R.,
when I was a medical student,</i>

17:27.507 --> 17:29.576
this old nurse
says to me,

17:29.643 --> 17:32.879
"don't you wear a nylon slip
under your scrub gown,
young lady.

17:32.946 --> 17:35.015
"It might set up
electrical charges...

17:35.082 --> 17:38.452
and cause an explosion
of the anesthetic gases
and damage the O.R."

17:38.518 --> 17:41.989
<i>They don't even use
Explosive gases anymore.</i>

17:42.055 --> 17:44.291
You want my advice?
Fight fire with Fire.

17:44.358 --> 17:46.827
Make her monitor vital signs
every 15 minutes.

17:46.893 --> 17:49.830
Let her do a hundred
urines at night, huh?

17:49.897 --> 17:51.899
She'll get the message.
That's not my style.

17:51.965 --> 17:56.069
Waking up at 4:00 in the morning
to put in an I.V.--
That's your style?

17:56.136 --> 17:58.605
Behavior modification
can be a wonderful thing.

18:08.682 --> 18:11.351
Why are they putting me
into this contraption,
Dr. Morrison?

18:11.418 --> 18:13.754
We have to weigh you
so we can monitor you...

18:13.820 --> 18:16.456
for malnutrition, dehydration,
things like that.

18:16.523 --> 18:20.027
Geez! I survived
the depression,
eight years of boxing--

18:20.093 --> 18:23.096
Thanks, guys.
Being pancaked on a Carrier
in the Pacific.

18:23.163 --> 18:25.499
Hell, I made it
through three marriages.

18:25.566 --> 18:28.769
But this damn hernia
is putting me away
like nobody's business.

18:28.835 --> 18:30.971
It was an incarcerated
hernia, Leo.

18:31.038 --> 18:33.040
Doesn't sound like much,
but it is.

18:33.106 --> 18:35.609
We're gonna let you rest
up here a while, Leo.

18:35.676 --> 18:38.045
It'll prevent
bedsores.

18:38.111 --> 18:40.614
Would you believe
a rotting dinosaur like me...

18:40.681 --> 18:44.284
used to be
a handsome young buck
like Dr. Morrison here?

18:44.351 --> 18:46.520
180 Pounds.

18:46.587 --> 18:49.590
- Heavyweight, Leo?
- No, I was a light-Heavyweight.

18:49.656 --> 18:51.725
<i>I made number six.
Oh, yeah?</i>

18:51.792 --> 18:54.528
Yeah. Then uncle Sam,
he grabbed me.

18:54.595 --> 18:57.097
Damn war Probably kept me
from getting killed.

18:57.164 --> 19:00.801
<i>I mean, I couldn't jab
to save my life.</i>

19:00.867 --> 19:04.271
- Mean uppercut, no doubt.
- Yeah, that's right.

19:04.338 --> 19:08.642
Hey, come here.
When can I you-Know-What
again?

19:08.709 --> 19:11.211
We'll try and take
the catheter out
in a day or so.

19:11.278 --> 19:14.781
It's killing me, doc.
I mean, it's humiliating.

19:14.848 --> 19:19.286
Oh, I was just asking the doc
if a beautiful doll like you
is married. That's all.

19:22.356 --> 19:25.359
<i>[ woman on P.A. ]
Dr. Cavanero, room 254.</i>

19:25.425 --> 19:28.328
<i>Dr. Cavanero, room 254.</i>

19:35.969 --> 19:37.938
[ groans ]
Annie.

19:38.005 --> 19:41.341
Hmm?
They want you
in room 254.

19:41.408 --> 19:45.646
[ groans ]
I was just about to give
Tom selleck a complete physical.

19:45.712 --> 19:47.714
[ chuckles ]
Sorry.

19:47.781 --> 19:49.783
[ Sighs ]

19:49.850 --> 19:53.153
too bad, Tom.
You'll just have to Wait.

19:56.757 --> 19:58.692
Hi, Cathy.
Hi.

19:58.759 --> 20:00.661
Bye.

20:01.929 --> 20:04.798
Are you off
for the rest of the day?
Uh-huh.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.769
Nice dress.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.143
You know, I've never
seen you wear white.

20:16.209 --> 20:18.245
I'm going
to a funeral.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.183
Cathy, usually people
wear black to funerals.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.419
I've noticed that.

20:25.485 --> 20:29.389
But you see, in Asia,
white is worn for mourning.

20:29.456 --> 20:31.959
They consider white--
the absence of color--

20:32.025 --> 20:33.961
the absence of life.

20:34.027 --> 20:37.831
Whereas black--
the combination
of all colors--

20:37.898 --> 20:39.900
is a symbol of life.

20:39.967 --> 20:41.602
I see.

20:45.339 --> 20:47.841
Who died?

20:47.908 --> 20:50.110
I don't know his name.

20:51.678 --> 20:54.147
You don't know the person
who's being buried?

20:56.750 --> 20:59.820
They brought him
into the morgue yesterday.

20:59.886 --> 21:04.291
They're going to dump him
in the city cemetery--
No Marker or anything.

21:05.759 --> 21:08.462
Oh, that is really--

21:15.269 --> 21:19.373
why don't you come over
to our house for dinner
sometime this week?

21:19.439 --> 21:22.242
<i>I'd love for my husband
to meet you.</i>

21:22.309 --> 21:26.313
That'd be nice,
Jacqueline. Thanks.

21:26.380 --> 21:29.583
<i>And bring Fiscus.
Robert loves Fiscus.</i>

21:31.184 --> 21:33.120
Everybody Does.

21:33.186 --> 21:35.188
He's so funny.

21:35.255 --> 21:39.226
You know, I wish Robert had
Fiscus's sense of Humor.

21:39.293 --> 21:41.795
Robert just doesn't know
how to have a good time.

21:41.862 --> 21:44.364
Your husband's Boring?

21:44.431 --> 21:48.435
<i>No.
Well, sometimes a little.</i>

21:48.502 --> 21:50.504
He's a workaholic.

21:50.571 --> 21:54.575
He's very low-Keyed,
very analytical.

21:54.641 --> 21:57.711
And it drives me crazy
when he trims his own beard...

21:57.778 --> 22:01.214
because he leaves
little hair clippings
all over the Sink.

22:01.281 --> 22:03.183
Ugh. How horrible.

22:05.252 --> 22:07.754
I guess I'm being
a little hard on him,

22:07.821 --> 22:10.824
but my husband is not what
you'd call a Romantic.

22:10.891 --> 22:14.394
Why do you stay
with him?
Because I love him.

22:14.461 --> 22:16.363
Hmm.

22:18.632 --> 22:21.501
Well, what do you say?
Thursday?

22:21.568 --> 22:24.471
My husband is
a terrible chef.

22:24.538 --> 22:27.374
His lobster archduke
will kill you.
Oh?

22:27.441 --> 22:29.776
But We've got
a great wine Cellar.

22:29.843 --> 22:33.313
[ chuckles ]
Okay.
Good.

22:33.380 --> 22:35.282
Will you ask Fiscus
or should I?

22:35.349 --> 22:38.352
Um, I'm seeing him
tonight.

22:38.418 --> 22:40.887
I'll let you know.

22:40.954 --> 22:44.157
I'd better get going.
I don't want to be late
for the funeral.

22:44.224 --> 22:46.126
Right.

22:47.227 --> 22:49.296
- Good-Bye.
- Bye.

22:55.235 --> 22:57.204
I told her that--
Shh.

23:08.882 --> 23:11.785
I tried to tell that nurse
this was no kind
of big deal.

23:11.852 --> 23:15.222
It's just a little
upset Stomach.
That's what I thought.

23:15.289 --> 23:17.791
It happens when you
go back on solids.

23:17.858 --> 23:20.427
I want you to eat real light
for a couple of days--

23:20.494 --> 23:22.629
Juices, soups, jell-O's--
that kind of thing.

23:22.696 --> 23:24.932
How 'bout fruit?
Mm-Mmm.

23:29.937 --> 23:33.206
<i>[ man ]
Yeah, but mrs. Shallo
ordered a bucket.</i>

23:33.273 --> 23:36.009
<i>I don't care what mrs. Shallo
told you on the telephone.</i>

23:36.076 --> 23:40.847
She cannot have
a bucket of chicken two hours
before her operation!

23:40.914 --> 23:43.917
Loceff?
Why did you call me
for Mr. Prensky?

23:43.984 --> 23:47.187
He was having
stomach cramps.
It was simple indigestion.

23:47.254 --> 23:49.323
I'm gonna say this
one more time.

23:49.389 --> 23:53.427
Indigestion,
insomnia, constipation--
None of these are emergencies.

23:53.493 --> 23:55.429
They can wait
until rounds.

23:55.495 --> 23:58.832
I'm not paid
to make those judgments,
Dr. Cavanero.

23:58.899 --> 24:02.903
I have been up for 36 hours.
I was trying to catch
a little sleep.

24:02.970 --> 24:06.373
I'm sorry, but that's
not my problem.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.476
Nurse loceff,
I would like you to give
a tap water enema...

24:09.543 --> 24:12.512
to patients weingrot,
malian and O'Connell
when they wake up.

24:12.579 --> 24:15.582
Also I would like
daily weights and I&O's
on all my patients.

24:15.649 --> 24:18.218
Is that clear?
Yes, Dr. Cavanero.

24:18.285 --> 24:20.187
Good.

24:34.301 --> 24:37.371
Four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.

24:37.437 --> 24:40.908
- Okay. How long?
- Thirty-Five minutes.

24:40.974 --> 24:44.111
<i>One, two, three, four, five.
[ Daniels ]
come on, Francine.</i>

24:44.177 --> 24:46.546
Come on. Come on.

24:46.613 --> 24:49.049
Okay. Stop C.P.R.
Let's get a reading here.

24:52.786 --> 24:54.755
<i>[ Steady BEEP ]</i>

24:56.056 --> 24:57.991
Asystole.
