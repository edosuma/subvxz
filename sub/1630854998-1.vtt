WEBVTT

00:43.443 --> 00:44.778
I am the way

00:44.778 --> 00:47.847
Into the city world.

00:51.418 --> 00:54.020
I am the way into which.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.893
I am able to go on the laws

00:59.893 --> 01:01.227
before me.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.396
There were no clear scenes,

01:04.497 --> 01:08.593
but those that last forever

01:09.736 --> 01:13.680
As to I.

01:15.442 --> 01:21.981
You are about to hundred.

01:21.981 --> 01:24.050
The presence

01:25.618 --> 01:47.540
of the motherfucking king.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.444
You ready, John?

01:56.249 --> 04:00.673
Yeah.

04:00.673 --> 04:03.142
Mr. Vick.

04:03.643 --> 04:13.386
To what do I owe the pleasure?

04:13.386 --> 04:17.829
My reign, my freedom

04:21.027 --> 04:22.028
Your reign is gone.

04:22.528 --> 04:25.932
Like the elder before me.

04:26.299 --> 04:29.402
And if you gave me a thinking,
you could end this by killing me.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.538
Then you are mistaken.

04:32.772 --> 04:37.743
My death not change the outcome
any more than you can change your nature.

04:38.544 --> 04:41.344
None of us can
escape who we are.

04:41.881 --> 04:46.052
And no one escapes the table.

04:46.152 --> 04:51.224
And the only way John Wick will ever
have freedom or peace now or ever

04:52.792 --> 04:55.328
is in death.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.931
I know.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.903
I'm afraid you've
come a very long way,

05:05.138 --> 05:06.472
but nothing.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.643
Here.

05:14.080 --> 06:05.098
Not really.

06:05.732 --> 06:15.441
The manager, please.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.444
A husband.

06:18.444 --> 06:21.377
You seemed to think so.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.317
This must be a mistake.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.119
There is no mistake.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.322
By order of the marquee
and simplicity of Grandma,

06:30.289 --> 06:39.432
this hotel has been condemned.

06:43.970 --> 06:53.546
You have one hour.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.986
It is expected that

07:05.758 --> 07:06.526
completely.

07:06.526 --> 07:10.129
Some decrees
signed by the 12 members of the table

07:11.597 --> 07:14.200
giving my key

07:14.200 --> 07:16.936
awards, have Imparato,
which means he is now

07:16.936 --> 07:19.639
our judge, jury and

07:23.176 --> 07:23.776
evacuated

07:23.776 --> 07:42.795
the hotel.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.630
That carries on the words.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.733
The hangman's noose around his neck were.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.471
Such is life. Such is the life.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.173
Can you imagine the acceptance
that you find?

07:55.074 --> 07:58.511
Today is not the day when I of.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.279
I'm sure

08:00.613 --> 08:03.683
you have the unshakable
faith of David, my friend.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.184
But you shouldn't be here.

08:06.385 --> 08:09.722
This will not be pleasant.

08:10.022 --> 08:37.350
Such is life. So.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.386
My father used to say.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.757
How you do anything

08:44.757 --> 08:46.859
is how you do everything.

08:47.860 --> 08:54.467
Call it the first
and the last rule of life.

08:54.467 --> 09:00.206
You will live in rooms, Mr.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.542
Manager.

09:03.142 --> 09:09.148
Why do I want to have consequences?

09:09.649 --> 09:12.151
Of course.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.022
And second chances. Are.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.291
And that's where we differ.

09:19.325 --> 09:23.996
You and I.

09:23.996 --> 09:27.833
Second chances are the refuge of men.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.201
Who then

10:01.300 --> 10:03.769
there are those on the table

10:04.870 --> 10:06.439
who blame this

10:06.672 --> 10:09.942
atrocity on New York.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.946
They believe it's this city

10:15.081 --> 10:16.282
that they would as indulge

10:16.282 --> 10:18.618
this fucking place for good on.

10:20.319 --> 10:23.222
And look what that has gotten us.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.560
I shot him.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.829
He lives.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.032
Polluting everything he touches.

10:33.032 --> 10:35.201
Key respectfully in my hotel.

10:35.201 --> 10:38.237
Your hotel?

10:38.871 --> 10:41.073
If I might.

10:41.140 --> 10:49.615
Some,

10:49.615 --> 10:54.186
by all means.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.455
The Continentals of the management

10:57.523 --> 11:01.627
of a reminder to all sit beneath the table

11:01.894 --> 11:07.333
that none of us are above the rules.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.069
And yet we are here.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.370
So, Mr. Wick.

11:11.370 --> 11:15.141
We're not here because of John Wick.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.546
He is simply the face of your failure, Mr.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.948
Manager.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.054
Sand in that glass

11:28.054 --> 11:30.956
is merely an echo of my remaining

11:30.956 --> 11:56.549
patience.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.524
You are no longer a New York.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.029
You are nothing.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.834
Let's go.

12:15.301 --> 12:20.239
And as such, you no longer need

12:20.239 --> 12:47.833
the services of a concierge.

12:48.601 --> 13:03.582
It has been an honor.

13:03.582 --> 13:07.319
Should it be? Yes,

13:09.188 --> 13:10.756
but it wasn't.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.459
You think about why that is.

13:13.459 --> 13:20.599
And perhaps one of us would have benefited
from this conversation.

13:20.599 --> 14:47.253
And then what came?

14:50.923 --> 14:52.591
I have a name for you.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.860
Respectfully.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.763
I'm retired, Mr.

14:57.997 --> 15:00.132
Dunn.

15:00.666 --> 15:01.367
It is a.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.138
I'm no use to you.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.540
All the table.

15:08.607 --> 15:12.144
That's not for you to decide.

15:17.116 --> 15:20.653
I think you should find someone else.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.291
Became close

15:25.791 --> 15:28.193
to today

15:28.460 --> 15:29.662
to close

15:30.062 --> 15:39.138
you put in danger.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.745
I know that you like

15:58.357 --> 15:59.692
a former associate.

15:59.692 --> 16:00.693
I believe

16:04.663 --> 16:05.798
he was

16:09.735 --> 16:12.371
a friend.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.245
Agreements with the table stays the same.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.649
I give you a name.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.684
You give us a life or

16:27.586 --> 16:48.140
we take one.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.510
I will serve.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.347
I will be of service.

16:57.316 --> 17:00.152
Excellent.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.190
I assume you have a notion away?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.125
Might be.

17:09.862 --> 17:10.295
John Wayne.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.598
Has few friends mean meaning in a world

17:13.632 --> 17:14.933
and even fewer.

17:14.933 --> 17:15.834
It was

17:16.502 --> 17:17.970
with his life.

17:22.141 --> 17:22.540
Very,

17:22.540 --> 18:12.724
very good.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.994
Welcome to the Osaka Continental.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.129
How can I help you?

18:17.129 --> 18:19.631
I'm looking for a room.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.602
I'm afraid this facility doesn't

18:23.602 --> 18:25.170
allow animals

18:26.672 --> 18:27.573
emotional support.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.109
And she is your support
all. The way around.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.044
First, is it that.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.253
She stays in your room?

18:43.655 --> 18:44.022
Enjoy.

18:44.022 --> 18:45.224
Stay so.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.367
I'm not too bad

18:56.835 --> 18:57.302
about it.

18:57.302 --> 19:11.550
All the.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.220
There is a dog in my lobby.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.655
I shall support her alone.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.457
Of course it is.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.992
To our schedule.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.729
Mr. Suzuki, at 11 in the thousands,
requesting an audience of two.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.731
Was decided. To have.

19:25.731 --> 19:26.832
Dinner with your daughter.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.101
She says she's concerned
you've been working too hard.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.137
What must I have done

19:32.137 --> 19:35.240
to deserve such a considerable child?

19:35.240 --> 19:36.475
Good column.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.477
Ms.. India.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.846
How are our guests?

19:41.580 --> 19:43.849
Some of our Gold Club members are anxious.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.718
It's always something.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.487
Today it's new rules.

19:48.487 --> 19:49.922
And my concierge.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.857
Concerned.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.793
Perhaps we should get you
on emotional support of.

19:59.865 --> 20:00.899
Just getting.

20:02.401 --> 20:02.801
It done.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.537
Nothing to offend the table. Relationship
with Mr.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.940
Blake is no secret.
The table will come through.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.077
Serious and

20:12.477 --> 20:15.347
will be met with our grace.

20:15.347 --> 20:20.619
Everything just nice.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.854
A minor chancery,
no rights, Korean authorities

20:24.122 --> 20:27.426
or any company for them.

20:32.531 --> 20:37.869
Oh, you know, please tell my daughter.

20:38.670 --> 20:55.587
That I look forward to our dinner.

20:59.491 --> 21:23.515
I waited, sitting.

21:25.651 --> 21:40.932
On your knees, kept on.

21:44.903 --> 21:47.072
Apparently not

21:47.973 --> 21:48.707
getting kidding. Deal.

21:48.707 --> 21:52.044
That was a mistake, my friend.

21:54.212 --> 21:56.248
Their response was the destruction

21:56.248 --> 21:59.551
of the New York continent.

22:00.085 --> 22:03.422
My daughter fears we are next

22:03.422 --> 22:05.857
Wednesday alive.

22:05.857 --> 22:08.060
But they executed his concierge.

22:09.361 --> 22:18.437
To prove a point.

22:23.475 --> 22:24.776
Have you given any thought

22:24.776 --> 22:27.946
to where this ends?

22:33.085 --> 22:36.455
The table will never stop.

22:36.955 --> 22:39.424
You know, this.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.930
It only takes life

22:44.930 --> 22:48.433
and only gives death.

22:53.071 --> 22:57.109
Koji, Very

23:00.078 --> 23:02.481
soon.

23:04.082 --> 23:05.751
Friendship means little

23:05.751 --> 23:57.135
when it's convenient for.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.271
Welcome to the Continental.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.605
How can I. Help the manager.

24:03.742 --> 24:05.177
Put for

24:07.179 --> 24:10.015
you? Of course.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.351
Just make yourself comfortable.

24:15.720 --> 24:19.658
He likes to tell me how.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.128
The only path

24:23.128 --> 24:27.132
this leads to his death.

24:28.934 --> 24:32.370
I'm going to kill all.

24:32.370 --> 24:34.473
I believe you will try.

24:34.473 --> 24:40.345
But no one,
not even you, can kill everyone.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.281
You want to die.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.351
That's your choice.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.620
A good death

24:48.854 --> 24:52.324
only comes after a good life.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.793
You and I left a good life behind.

24:54.893 --> 25:02.100
Long time ago, my friend.

25:02.100 --> 25:05.237
For the high table.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.272
What is he doing?

25:07.472 --> 25:10.642
Mr. The is our guest.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.444
I'll talk to them.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.246
They don't know you're here.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.881
They go stay.

25:15.881 --> 25:25.957
With the mystery.

25:25.957 --> 25:27.692
Because I'm on television.

25:27.692 --> 25:28.026
All the.

25:28.026 --> 25:52.851
That's what you all

25:56.221 --> 25:58.723
welcome to the Osaka
Continental gentleman.

26:00.191 --> 26:03.194
How may I view the service?

26:03.194 --> 26:04.863
The table has reason to believe

26:04.863 --> 26:08.867
that this facility is providing services
which Cui

26:09.367 --> 26:12.137
excommunicated.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.372
That is a grave accusation.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.945
We will require full access to your hotel.

26:20.011 --> 26:21.212
Of course.

26:21.646 --> 26:24.182
But as you are well aware, no business,

26:25.350 --> 26:29.454
Not even your kind of business
may be conducted on continental grounds.

26:30.488 --> 26:33.158
So I'm going to have to ask you

26:33.158 --> 26:37.028
to surrender your firearms.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.297
We speak for the monkeys.

26:39.297 --> 26:42.067
And I speak for succor.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.768
Your guns.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.103
Please

26:47.038 --> 26:48.740
don't repeat the mistake that fully.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.342
New York Me.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.210
Fools talk.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.112
Cowboys is silent.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.748
Wiseman, Listen.

26:56.748 --> 26:57.549
So which one will.

26:57.549 --> 26:58.283
You be

27:04.889 --> 27:07.525
true? You.

27:09.060 --> 27:09.694
Hello.

27:10.528 --> 27:12.731
Old friend.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.834
So good of you to visit

27:15.834 --> 27:19.037
after all these years.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.372
You are with them now?

27:20.372 --> 27:24.075
No, No.

27:24.743 --> 27:27.045
Your daughter, Mia

27:29.314 --> 27:32.050
alive.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.953

27:42.227 --> 27:43.094
To know

27:45.497 --> 27:48.867
we don't have to end this with blood.

27:49.701 --> 27:50.502
Leave.

27:51.302 --> 27:52.871
No one defies the table.

27:52.871 --> 27:54.973
I remember once you understood that.

27:55.373 --> 27:58.076
I remember a time when you understood the.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.045
Meaning of brotherhood. Enough.

28:01.546 --> 28:02.781
By order of the mountains.

28:02.781 --> 28:05.450
The moment Peace Hotel
has been consecrated.

28:06.885 --> 28:20.231
Step aside.

28:24.269 --> 28:25.170
Don't do this.

You. Sorry.

Find the weak. You.

30:33.064 --> 30:36.801
If they find you here,

48:50.961 --> 48:51.895

48:53.864 --> 48:55.132
You made it.

Not enough.

49:22.092 --> 49:25.862
But it's getting there.

49:25.862 --> 49:30.334
But I needed to take better care

49:30.334 --> 49:31.802
of some shouting.

49:33.971 --> 49:34.338
Because we're

49:34.338 --> 49:44.548

49:44.548 --> 49:48.085
Oh, oh, oh,

You know I won't. Oh,

50:43.473 --> 51:04.061

you? Oh, John, wake

51:08.365 --> 51:12.335
me up in.

51:12.335 --> 51:15.872
He has no lock on you

51:20.811 --> 51:23.146
must have fallen far to believe

51:23.980 --> 51:26.983
the only deaths we have

51:27.484 --> 51:35.725
lie in the lockers.

51:35.725 --> 51:39.429
Come on.

51:39.429 --> 52:15.265
I don't want to do this.

52:15.265 --> 52:20.237
I creaks.

52:22.005 --> 52:22.639
Yeah.

52:23.373 --> 52:25.675
You want

52:43.326 --> 52:53.670
to look at me?

52:53.670 --> 52:55.672
Even the blind man knows you've lost

52:58.141 --> 53:01.478
and pain.

53:01.478 --> 53:08.385
You don't need the eyes to see right?

53:08.385 --> 53:09.219
This took care.

53:09.219 --> 53:16.560
Of the daughter. I.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.028
Yeah, I

53:19.062 --> 53:21.464

53:25.702 --> 54:04.174
Oh, so

54:07.677 --> 54:29.899
this.

54:29.899 --> 54:31.935
Oh, I'll be waiting for you.

54:57.727 --> 55:53.383
In the morning. You.

55:53.383 --> 55:55.352
It was a fine.

55:57.454 --> 55:58.855
Mother's Day

56:02.592 --> 56:07.897
executed.

56:07.897 --> 56:12.202
So of a huge.

56:12.202 --> 56:21.911
Oh, I understand

56:42.599 --> 56:43.733
to by.

56:44.834 --> 57:08.992

57:08.992 --> 57:10.560
Thanks for coming

57:11.861 --> 57:12.228
for us.

57:12.228 --> 57:14.130
Homeless folk do have to stick together.

57:14.130 --> 57:19.869
Now go.

57:19.869 --> 57:24.441
I need to speak to you.

57:24.441 --> 57:29.045
Last time
you spoke to them, shot them off and Ruth

57:30.113 --> 57:31.548
had no choice.

57:32.081 --> 57:34.584
They are the comes known

57:36.286 --> 57:37.754
who held the gun.

57:37.754 --> 57:42.559
John needs to know the breadth of what's
coming at this party is on this train.

57:42.559 --> 57:44.527
They told my brother Malcolm.

57:44.527 --> 57:48.998
Oh, my dear Winston,
your benevolence is touching.

57:50.800 --> 57:51.367
But tell me.

57:51.367 --> 57:53.536
Tell me the truth.

57:53.536 --> 57:56.840
Why did the Frenchman let you go?

57:56.840 --> 58:00.210
Your man can turn him into a martyr

58:00.210 --> 58:01.878
wearing a red

58:03.046 --> 58:04.781
around the world is a coward

58:04.781 --> 58:09.185
who returned home.

58:09.185 --> 58:14.757
So what are you going to.

58:37.080 --> 58:40.450
Fail to see how a wasted continentals it's

58:40.483 --> 58:43.853
getting you closer to killing the job,
Which.

58:43.853 --> 58:44.988
Is gang bangers?

58:44.988 --> 58:47.490
Not a good deal in general, Mr.

58:47.490 --> 58:49.592
Cue the idea of John Wick.

58:50.560 --> 58:53.530
And to do that I was Destroyer.

58:53.530 --> 58:56.966
Everything that idea touches.

58:59.936 --> 59:02.171
The bloodshed in a shock.

59:02.672 --> 59:04.007
It's not necessary.

59:05.241 --> 59:07.577
The bloodshed.

59:07.577 --> 59:08.945
What's the point.

59:18.254 --> 59:19.322
When it comes to.

59:24.594 --> 59:25.228
You? Make it

59:25.228 --> 59:34.237
your choice.

59:34.237 --> 59:37.240
You come with me.

59:37.674 --> 59:40.977
And twice before accepting.

59:46.416 --> 59:47.750
And you are

59:48.451 --> 59:49.352
nobody

59:51.721 --> 59:52.088
quite.

59:52.088 --> 59:56.726
Is this the nobody is a pathetic trade,

59:58.561 --> 01:00:00.263
a miscalculation

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.765
in which by trying to hide away you go.

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:08.371
We let it appear stark naked.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:15.345
I realize only once.

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:19.916
Oh, Were you able to locate him?

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:27.457
And I'll tell you.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.726
How much would such a service be worth?

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.861
25 million.

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:34.197
Plus a metric contribution to my 401k.

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:36.232
What is that

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:40.136
we found in

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:44.307
was if I never get that before or after,

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.576
he puts you in the ground

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:57.720
like you,

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:03.559
20 million, I guess.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:06.429
More 23

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.433
Ego is dead.

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:13.336
Nobody is 23

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.137
and clearly.

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:23.312
Can afford it.

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:31.587
Well, this is. Our

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.059
second

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.762
spoon.

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:42.665
Who do What does this look across

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.535
the blue And I found.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.603
Oh, you can put your hand out.

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:52.141
One chose me I'm
I'm committed only to absolve the other.

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.343
A man committed to the.

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.478
Cause

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:56.913
which.

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:00.616
Drew.

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.297
Him to.

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:25.174
Oh oh, oh, oh.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:36.652
Oh, oh

01:02:41.557 --> 01:03:32.575
of us.

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:34.010
Winston,

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:39.048
Jonathan, my condolences.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:44.520
He was a good man.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.622
Yes, He was

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:58.768
taken for our sins.

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:00.803
Who is this?

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.973
You're my grandmother.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:07.877
Elevated only by his guarantee
of killing you.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.546
All the resources at the table
are at his disposal.

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.617
Where do I find

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:21.090
Paris?

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:26.562
Where will it end?

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:28.431
With him? Dead.

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:32.568
Oh, again? Hmm.

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:36.973
Have you learned nothing?

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:42.144
They will replace him
before the body is called Achilles.

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:43.579
Hades Hydra.

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:44.814
You had the table.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:52.255
Have you run out of bullets
before they run out of heads?

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:54.657
Kill him. But you were the smart way to

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:56.592
get him to kill you.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.660
You feel

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:04.200
how journey's rules and consequences
against him

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:06.569
Challenge him to single combat

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:09.538
on table.

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:12.141
Two months are missed from

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.278
a cold, hard

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:18.314
fact and part of the foundation
of the table.

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:24.220
Two selfish,
more combustible members of our road war.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.289
It's also where a lose

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:31.427
what you say you want

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:37.066
a way out?

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.502
I don't sit at the table.

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.704
Your family does

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:45.608
get them to issue the challenge
and then offer you up as a proxy.

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.444
I don't have a family.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.479
Just room to them to

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:56.152
Now I suggest you get your ass to Berlin

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.956
and get it mended or

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:06.896
break a plot.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:10.599
What do you get out of this, Mr.

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:10.833
Wood?

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:13.703
You were so good at getting Jonathan

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.137
revenge

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:06.322
last night.

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:07.523
You really are.

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.725
Starting.

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:28.411
So you

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:31.881
should use

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:33.816
more of those.

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:34.383
Shoes.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:37.286
A lot of the

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.923
wash soup, meaning there's no backbiting

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:44.226
dripping through.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.238
My suit.

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:09.752
When I

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:13.355
speak.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.157
He's in Berlin.

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:17.158
Of the Rusk aroma.

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:18.359
Think I wanted that finder's fee?

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.763
Now? No

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.033
kids, I work for you.

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:24.667
Get your.

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:29.772
I want him part of our deal.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.041
The deal was for your service.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.443
And it's our life.

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:39.115
For life is to nobody goes

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:41.684
Oh, yes.

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:45.020
When it's done, you will have your prize

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:56.432
and your pension,

01:08:56.432 --> 01:09:11.279
asshole. And

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:25.327
goodness in Venus.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:27.029
No, it doesn't.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:27.962
But you need to go.

01:09:27.962 --> 01:09:30.432
Edelman Jonathan, think.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.203
Deep personal story got into.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.773
It It does doesn't

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.975
closure Chris Nolan over Raymond.

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:44.647
And you noticed me but I think.

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:51.886
You are forgetting
we are still under the table.

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:54.890
I must, I checked.

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:57.426
You are excluded.

01:09:57.426 --> 01:10:00.396
I think it was talk.

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:05.034
You have no business with us

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:09.638
after the we shot be there is dead

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:20.583
After you put a bullet in the other's
head.

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.651
The is had one bullet in builder's

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:28.424
hand in fine Russian tradition.

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:31.594
He sent us the bill

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.662
Because of you

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:38.467
I had to kneel in front of the man
who murdered my father.

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:41.503
We common enemy.

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:46.642
We can help you learn.

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.944
You can't even help yourself.

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:53.082
How the hell are you going to help us?

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:56.819
By showing this court. She.

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:58.687
They just appointed another.

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:02.024
You will need to go in the.

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:05.761
Dust if I can.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:08.964
I never saw

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:17.573
your hair

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:23.178
so continuously.

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:28.350
The things you wish to succeed will bring.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.185
It will. Mother will choose.

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:33.155
In you and you

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:48.671
will do.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.307
How many did you kill to get out?

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:54.443
Oh, Lord.

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:57.579
You will only have to kill one

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:59.915
to get back in the bastard

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.785
who murdered my father.

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:06.989
Killed a.

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:07.723
Gila.

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:08.657
Harker

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.694
will find the matrimonial home.

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:16.932
When he's dead,
I will manage to get to Christ.

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:18.534
Had guns first.

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.035
Then we took

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:22.404
bring proof of death.

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:26.675
You owe me the way is.

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:30.946
There no way

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:42.958
Gloves will take you.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.760
I am so

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.498
glad, John.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:13:43.018
I am still your mistress
Since I have ordered by this gesture

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:45.521
and that of forward
to our continuing partnership

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:56.665
and is that John.

01:13:57.299 --> 01:14:00.969
Vick in simpler if.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.071
You step up okay.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:07.276
That must be dismissed.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.611
Yeah. And

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:19.488
they are my.

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:27.262
Meniscus, I think

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:28.931
is the big

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:34.703
you are expected of me

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:38.874
in John

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.212
my life

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:44.046
come.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.217
You I've been here I suspected it.

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:55.557
Family.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:58.227
That family sold you out Mr. Big

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:01.630
gave you up.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:05.667
It's a vain hope of saving themselves.

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.769
You see, That's why I never trusted
Cossacks.

01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:09.638
I did it.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:13.742
People.

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:18.313
This person.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:21.583
I sense danger here.

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:25.354
Mr. Wig may probably feel responsible
for the death.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:33.595
Of a mutual friend,
but I didn't kill Koji.

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:39.768
Even dear John,
you know this discord between our friends.

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:42.271
It saddens me

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.673
and love me to have

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:49.444
died.

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:53.448
We have a deal.

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:55.517
Had the monkey.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.654
And I thought that night,
if you put it that I.

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:01.089
I blamed bad

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:13.268
husband and growls

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:19.741
and different.

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:23.412
This is for me. Mr.

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:27.950
Nobody.

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:28.717
And no.

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:30.586
It's actually for. Him

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.523
and for.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:37.593
Center exceeds Mr. Nobody

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:42.197
and the

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:53.942
exciting yeah it so.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:58.213
You want to get him

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:02.050
you want to kill him.

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:04.019
I want to kill him.

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:06.121
And what about your mistake?

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:08.590
I am going to kill you.

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:11.426
Oh, for bad.

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:13.462
Of course you are

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:14.596
right.

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:17.532
It looks like we have ourselves

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:20.035
a genuine conundrum,

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:24.873
a quandary,
if you will, out of the life dilemma.

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:27.476
Oh, so

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.912
I thought we play a game.

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.347
One that

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:36.118
decides who lives

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:38.787
and who does not.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.557
And. And

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:45.994
I was to buy

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:49.197
more than you can afford from

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:54.670
one bullet away
from being a very rich man.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.304
What did fun

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.542
five control

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:27.402
Mr. Big Mr.

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:52.694
Big Dead Man's end.

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:54.029
Mr. Big

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:00.335
Well.

01:19:00.335 --> 01:19:04.706
I don't gamble.

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:13.215
Let's see.

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:16.651
Four lines and a four most impressive

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.001
slash.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.270
Pretty good for nobody.

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:38.206
Thank you.

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:40.876
And linemen. And the guy is a dog.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.513
And John bag full control of TV seat.

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:45.781
That's a table

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:47.816
so that

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:50.552
it sounds like the beginning
of a stupendous joke.

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:55.590
Or most profitable opportunity.

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:59.461
One thinks he can serve his buyout

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:08.403
One thinks he can buy his way out

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.976
and one thinks

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:21.183
he can be on his way out.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.718
Each of them
all thinks that they have a him.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.722
But what they fail

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.791
to realize.

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:31.993
Is that the moment they took a seat

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:36.264
at the table.

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:38.600
They had already lost.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.671
Let me guess, five been kind.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.840
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.008
Oh, God. Got time.

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:48.476
Yeah. Oh, God. God.

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:52.080
John, just so you know

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:58.153
that it wasn't personal.

01:20:58.153 --> 01:21:02.724
Maybe a little bit.

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:16.938
Jim, You know?

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:20.542

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:35.096
yeah,

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:42.270
yeah. And

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:49.077
you, yeah,

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:51.446
yeah.

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:53.181
That's a problem.

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:56.451
You are lucky

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:58.920
you are lucky.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.357
I It's all right.

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:04.792
Sure you

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:09.664
know.

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:10.231
Yeah,

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:11.766
yeah,

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:15.570
yeah.

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:23.411
You know that, that

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:33.221
could

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:49.130
throw you.

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:52.767
Oh, what's

01:27:53.101 --> 01:28:00.675
wrong?

01:28:00.675 --> 01:29:10.812
Why don't you just die? You.

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:14.182
He's mine.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:16.384
I told you not to take it.

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:16.751
Yeah, I guess.

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:19.153
You doing that to work out either?

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:22.890
Oh, how long it takes to take your eyes

01:29:22.924 --> 01:29:28.262
down.

01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:31.833
It didn't take them.

01:29:31.833 --> 01:30:03.798
I gave them.

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:06.100
These seem fellows.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:06.567
See that?

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:09.303
They're not shy about like

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:09.971
this.

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.673
Fellows, it's none of your

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:13.875
business.

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:14.942
Maybe she

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:24.218
by across

01:30:24.652 --> 01:30:26.687
my divide.

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:29.390
Get it to my boy.

01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:33.594
Via in my ass.

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:53.614
She's in

01:30:55.049 --> 01:31:06.360
the proposal of what's the point of any.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:06.727
Yeah.

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:12.366
The Ruska Roma will support your challenge

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:44.432
Who will be your second man?

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:50.605
Warning of the cost of tyranny.

01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:52.773
You must intend to join your guns. Yes.

01:31:53.875 --> 01:32:02.750
Not today.

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:03.885
The old ways of the old.

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:06.120
Those John Wick calls you to do

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:10.825
to sell your differences
the old fashioned way as gentlemen.

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:14.262
Sure.

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:17.431
Because you're always as if you know them.

01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:18.432
A man of Mr.

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:23.070
Exterior cannot issue such a challenge.

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:29.911
He has his family's clenched.

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.412
Berlin, Moscow.

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:33.447
Rome would challenge the acceptance of Mr.

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:34.682
Wood back into the fold.

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:36.317
It's all there.

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:46.460
Recorded history now.

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:49.363
And why would I observe this
from a second rate seat?

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:52.466
Because there were rules.
And without them.

01:32:52.466 --> 01:32:54.268
We live with the animals.

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:57.471
Exactly. Oh,

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:00.741
times are changing.

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:02.677
A new day is dawning.

01:33:02.677 --> 01:33:06.414
New ideas, new rules,

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:09.917
new management.

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:15.389
Yet you will accept because we all still
see beneath the table.

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:27.301
Even you are not immune
to the consequences of.

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:29.904
And what exactly
how is the works? As does.

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:34.008
Victoria Fiduciary.

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:37.278
The unconditional release
of any and all obligations

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:53.628
to the table.

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:57.898
History is littered with marquees
who are only remembered by the servants.

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.167
But you

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:05.239
you could be remembered
as the man who brought John Wick

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:08.242
the most feared of all by the table,

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:11.712
who said it into the light.

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:13.381
Your life

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:16.851
and who could predict

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:20.021
how high that kind of glory
could take A man.

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:21.756
In our room

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:38.639
to know.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.475
That offend to discuss wounds.

01:34:42.309 --> 01:34:44.345
You may go.

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:47.715
When I'm done.

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:50.651
As you secured your opponent. His victory.
My excommunication.

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:53.921
Who is to be lifted,
my title restored, my hotel

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:57.224
rebuilt
and re consecrated all of the tables.

01:34:57.224 --> 01:35:00.428
Expect.

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:01.696
Of course.

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:11.972
This was a vision.

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:16.510
How you do
anything is how you do everything.

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:21.282
Now I'm done.

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:24.351
I think I'll miss you. And ergo shame.

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:25.319
I can't hear you say

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:27.455
you don't know.

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.790
Do. What's that?

01:35:31.592 --> 01:35:33.928
And then second, like a sponsor

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:36.997
either walks out with a champagne

01:35:36.997 --> 01:35:39.633
or is buried beside a

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.503
They always.

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:51.612
Such as live.

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:40.828
Under the old laws.

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:43.164
Only one can survive.

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:45.065
We both understand that.

01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:49.470
Very good

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.405
rules.

01:36:51.872 --> 01:36:56.477
The challenge chooses first.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:37:03.818
So rise. Now

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:10.858
Sunrise, location.

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:15.129
You come in thinking
there is a way out of this world

01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:17.298
for you was to weak

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:20.134
or is not

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:23.971
the strong.

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:29.610
Self-Critical.

01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:35.182
Sector could

01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:37.418
weapons.

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:39.753
If you win.

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:42.556
The table will honor as well.

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:45.025
I will have your freedom

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:47.795
but you won't take its

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:53.934
place.

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:56.003
This is.

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:03.544
Dueling pistols,

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:05.446
30 paces.

01:38:05.779 --> 01:38:09.650
In the event that both parties survive,
each will approach the other

01:38:09.683 --> 01:38:13.654
at increments of ten paces
until only one remains.

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:16.423
Rules of engagement.

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:19.860
No, no court.

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:23.230
You know
why you won't take your freedom and

01:38:25.699 --> 01:38:28.636
because this is who you are.

01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:32.373
We've always been.

01:38:32.373 --> 01:38:37.411
You are a killer, an orphan,

01:38:37.811 --> 01:38:40.648
plucked from the street
and thrown into a knife.

01:38:41.882 --> 01:38:45.586
And it is the killing that gives
you purpose.

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:48.355
A man with without purpose

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:53.027
is nothing.

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:56.096
No quarter.

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:57.598
No quarter.

01:38:57.698 --> 01:39:01.101
If there is nothing else, gentlemen.

01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:06.473
A nomination.

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:09.977
It is his right.

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:16.550
Do you have a name?

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:20.220
Okay.

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.791
So the sunrise, Sacred Core,

01:39:25.726 --> 01:39:27.127
dueling pistols.

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:28.429
No. Quarter to.

01:39:28.429 --> 01:39:30.664
Mr. will be victorious.

01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:33.534
It will be free of any and all obligation
to the high table.

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:38.405
And the second will be reinstated
as the manager of the rebuilt

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:42.476
New York Continental.

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:45.813
So the marquee, Vincent
beside the Grand Mobley, victorious.

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:47.481
John Wick will be dead

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:53.821
as well as second.

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:55.055
Just so

01:39:55.622 --> 01:39:58.692
now, if there is nothing more, gentlemen,
I will see you at sunrise.

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:00.794
Failure to meet at the appointed.

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:14.108
Our results in forfeiture
and immediate execution.

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:14.508
There

01:40:15.976 --> 01:40:18.345
is no run out there,

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.548
no habeas van.

01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:25.652
A normal life.

01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:27.721
There's only John Wick.

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:33.060
The killer, and he is going to kill me.

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:38.732
And. And

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.836
your hotel? Yes.

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:44.371
You always.

01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:46.774
How many times doesn't everyone?

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:48.475
That's fine.

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:51.678
Save up before Scott.

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:53.514
There's something I need to do first.

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:55.682
Sooner rather than later

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.988
we'll do it.

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:06.894
You fight your own fight.

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:13.100
Isn't this what you want,
Victoria Fiducia,

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:16.203
You kill him and you and

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:20.107
your daughter will be free.

01:41:20.107 --> 01:41:23.110
No one can touch her.

01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:24.378
If you don't,

01:41:25.212 --> 01:41:29.383
she will have to face the consequences.

01:41:29.383 --> 01:42:58.372
The choice is yours. And

01:42:59.873 --> 01:43:02.276
John.

01:43:02.276 --> 01:43:06.580
Same advice, same about

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:16.757
you. Think your wife can hear you?

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:22.196
No. Why bother.

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:25.299
Leaving?

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:26.567
I'm on.

01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:30.571
The debt.

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:31.939
I call

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:42.749
only the living matter.

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:46.920
After my daughter was born.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:51.091
I want to leave this life.

01:43:51.091 --> 01:43:54.861
I thought I did.

01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:58.532
But you didn't.

01:43:58.532 --> 01:44:00.367
Would damned

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:04.771
you and I.

01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:11.011
And then we agree.

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:15.983
My daughter's not.

01:44:15.983 --> 01:44:16.617
It was between.

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:19.987
You and her.

01:44:19.987 --> 01:44:28.495
You're going to die.

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:35.202
Maybe not.

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:38.972
I missed you, John.

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:46.680
It's so good to sit with a friend.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:45:18.879
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:19.579
This is you.

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:24.318
Resolve the situation
well with the baby feel

01:45:24.318 --> 01:45:26.787
You shake the foundation of the high table

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:30.357
and it will turn which.

01:45:30.357 --> 01:45:34.294
Into a set.

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:39.232
My victory will do the opposite.

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:42.536
My cleaner grandma.

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:44.838
A man's ambition

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:50.010
should never exceed is worth.

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:51.778
We would do well to remember.

01:45:51.778 --> 01:46:04.324
That, sir.

01:46:04.324 --> 01:46:09.129
To raise a small dream of.

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:10.163
Your son.

01:46:12.065 --> 01:46:15.068
On a good day

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:19.973
does not icemen

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.976
yacht guard was.

01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:28.081
Said to stay.

01:46:39.292 --> 01:46:52.539
At the base of.

01:47:11.291 --> 01:47:16.430
What was your arm is your weak and welcome

01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:20.700
to no resistance
far from home, aren't you?

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:24.771
Well, your little act of civil
disobedience inspired me, John.

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:27.908
I'm branching up, spread my wings

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:32.112
goes the girl farewell tour

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:34.681
coming to an end.

01:47:35.048 --> 01:47:38.485
So it seems so it seems

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:41.421
42 regular wasn't

01:47:41.555 --> 01:47:45.091
skipped log front to back the latest
ballistic chic

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:49.329
appropriate for formal occasions
weddings funerals, high table duels.

01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:52.098
After all, a man has to look his best.

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:54.000
It's time to get married

01:47:55.068 --> 01:48:06.880
or buried.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.448
Forgive me, sir,

01:48:08.949 --> 01:48:10.884
but this is like this.

01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:13.153
But this.

01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:16.523
If I see your face wobbling.

01:48:16.523 --> 01:48:18.658
The three types of men in this world

01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:23.029
must have something to move from.

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:27.334
Those who have something to die for

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:30.170
and those who have something to give for

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:32.973
John Wick, as none of these things

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:35.408
is but a ghost in search of a graveyard

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:40.213
for the blind man of.

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:43.416
Yes, all three.

01:48:43.416 --> 01:48:46.119
Besides, I have a feeling Mr. Wick.

01:48:46.653 --> 01:48:48.688
Will never make it. To the duel.

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:54.194
Mercenaries,

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:55.395
companies.

01:49:04.905 --> 01:49:35.368
And. All right.

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:38.972
Now, for all you boppers out there
in the City of lights,

01:49:39.272 --> 01:49:42.208
for all you street people
with a new for the action

01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:45.278
took all my loyalties.

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:47.414
Photo of the street

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:53.119
Tonight is your chance
to make some beautiful music.

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:55.822
I've been asked to fill a special request.

01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:58.792
A secret admirer. My,

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:00.060
It seems.

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.763
There's a thorn
in our little slice of paradise.

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:07.434
Oh, we can tell the Big Apple is making.

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:09.936
A beeline to our sacred. Heart.

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:12.839
When I call out

01:50:12.839 --> 01:50:16.209
to deliver your heart beat
Smashing for that.

01:50:16.843 --> 01:50:20.313
If you want a prize,
you must finish before sunrise.

01:50:21.114 --> 01:50:23.283
This golden oldie.

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:28.254
And I do mean golden
it goes out to you, Mr.

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:31.024
Wick.

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:33.693
And remember, there is no way to run

01:51:02.022 --> 01:51:12.065
this city.

01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:39.693
There is.

01:51:39.693 --> 01:51:43.730
I want to thank you all
for listening to w you.

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:46.866
Eggs are the place for all.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:49.369
Entertainment. And information.

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:54.340
Always good to.

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.676
And so it begins.

01:51:57.277 --> 01:52:00.980
I'm going to need you to go.

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:03.717
I thought you never asked a

01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:06.453
nine millimeter pit packer.

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:08.321
How would you get this?

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:10.957
I know a guy who knows a guy
who shot a guy

01:52:12.392 --> 01:52:15.361
21 road passing magazine
with a built in compensator

01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:18.631
for virtually no
muzzle flip fiber optic frontside

01:52:18.998 --> 01:52:23.136
and the Dexterous safeties
flared Bagwell for faster reloads

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:29.042
pound extreme quicker and for those more
how shall we say intimate encounters.

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:30.977
This might prove

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:37.417
as ferocious fucking things.

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:38.685
Of course.

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:45.825
Can you get me to the church?

01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:57.270
Amen.

01:52:57.270 --> 01:53:01.207
Here we are, gentlemen.

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:05.845
Your ride.

01:53:05.845 --> 01:53:09.949
When I advised you not
to give your pinky back into this club,

01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:13.953
I didn't think I'd get what.

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:20.794
It'll all be over for today.

01:53:20.794 --> 01:53:24.998
When I was burying Charade,

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:27.534
I was torn about what
put on his gravestone

01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:31.738
Three words to sum up an entire life

01:53:32.839 --> 01:53:35.775
long live look

01:53:35.775 --> 01:53:36.476
at my man.

01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:39.546
Years ago. Modest.

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:43.183
The prophetic.

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:45.418
What did you decide,

01:53:45.752 --> 01:53:47.020
friend?

01:53:47.887 --> 01:53:48.855
That's what it was.

01:53:48.855 --> 01:54:01.167
Above all else, a friend.

01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:05.605
The one who bouchard's pursuing.

01:54:05.605 --> 01:54:07.106
Thank you. Can

01:54:09.542 --> 01:54:10.844
Jonathan.

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:12.011
When?

01:54:12.011 --> 01:54:15.148
December sunrise is at 603.

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:20.119
Don't be late for all the steaks and

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:31.965
loving my husband.

01:54:31.965 --> 01:54:36.469
That's
what I want on my job loving husband.

01:55:06.633 --> 01:55:07.800
Confirmed

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:12.472
good news of whose We have a sighting.

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:17.210
Our men in black has been spotted
and to sit him out and disappear.

01:55:18.511 --> 01:55:21.481
I It's high time we've been separated.

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:44.938
And it's

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:22.508
just good to.

01:57:24.737 --> 01:57:26.472
It seems like old friends.

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:31.344
I think you dropped a bomb
and now is rolling to the activity over.

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:49.562
Let's see who picks it up.

01:57:49.562 --> 01:58:51.657
Oh, oh,

01:58:53.459 --> 01:59:38.371
oh, oh, no.

01:59:38.371 --> 01:59:40.139
Come on. Now, people.

01:59:40.139 --> 01:59:46.312
We're going to have to do a lot better.

01:59:46.312 --> 01:59:57.623
Know who's going to be our winner. Now.

01:59:57.623 --> 02:00:01.027
Oh, oh, oh,

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:12.972

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:42.201
Look.

02:00:42.201 --> 02:00:45.671
Good, good,

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:54.480
good, good,

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:59.585
good.

02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:24.910
Well,

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:30.483
know. Oh,

02:01:32.351 --> 02:02:17.096
God. Who is this?

02:02:17.496 --> 02:02:21.000
You know, the question
you should be asking is how much.

02:02:21.567 --> 02:02:28.474
I think we have
the situation under control.

02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:33.546
Yeah, because the way I see it,

02:02:33.979 --> 02:02:37.983
instead of this majority
or in the short term, Mr.

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:39.518
Mayor, last night, as one could.

02:02:47.193 --> 02:03:07.413

Oh, oh.

Go round one

02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:50.956
oh. Have

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:55.261
a little traffic update.

02:03:55.261 --> 02:03:59.432
I'm hearing two boys in black couldn't
get it done or we could.

02:03:59.432 --> 02:04:01.667
Friend is on the move again.

02:04:01.667 --> 02:04:03.335
He's headed your way.

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:06.739
My listeners at the pace.

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:09.341
Oh, oh,

All right. 35 it is.

Well,

02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:57.543

But what.

02:07:04.450 --> 02:07:06.518

Bummers.

The lottery just went. Oh,

I don't know

02:07:52.665 --> 02:07:56.935

Good.

Oh, oh, oh.

So are you still setting aside

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:37.549
Mr. Nick has to change inside.

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:40.385
We are almost out of time.

02:12:40.385 --> 02:12:43.221
Let's just to win the prize before Mr.

02:12:43.255 --> 02:12:44.089
Wicks.

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:48.293
Less sirens so it was going to cost us

02:12:48.293 --> 02:12:57.803
222 steps.

02:12:57.803 --> 02:13:11.683
It shows you

02:13:37.642 --> 02:16:19.504
how to do it.

02:16:19.504 --> 02:16:37.822
Yeah.

02:16:37.822 --> 02:16:41.325
Yeah.

You know, you

Only.

02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:30.275
Do the pins.

02:17:30.275 --> 02:17:33.878
Mr. Wick won't be joining us.

02:17:51.596 --> 02:17:55.767
On John

02:17:58.335 --> 02:17:59.537
Kane.

Well, time to sunrise,

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:02.841
and then

02:18:04.743 --> 02:18:10.181
to leave in 3 minutes.

02:18:10.181 --> 02:18:12.384
I need you to get to the top
of those stairs.

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:17.254

02:18:17.254 --> 02:18:21.793
Yeah, I.

Ready?

02:18:50.155 --> 02:18:58.129
Nine to put

All right.

All that's interesting, John.

We're even down.
