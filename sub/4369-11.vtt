Are you doing
science experiments
in your lab today?

03:20.030 --> 03:22.202
Well, I can't do them
at the water park anymore

03:22.202 --> 03:23.704

Wow, I love science.

It's like my step-uncle

03:29.780 --> 03:31.181
"Science is golden."

03:31.181 --> 03:32.543
Silence.
(SOFTLY) Sorry.

03:34.044 --> 03:35.816
So what are you
working on?

03:37.488 --> 03:39.790
I'm attempting to
create a solvent

03:39.790 --> 03:41.592
to dissolve a super
adhesive polymer

03:41.592 --> 03:42.653
I created this morning.

03:42.653 --> 03:43.624
Why do you need
to dissolve it?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.155
Perhaps Renaldo
can explain.

03:45.155 --> 03:46.657
Because I glued
myself to the table.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.331
Why would you do that?

03:50.331 --> 03:52.363
To see if I could glue
myself to a table.

03:52.363 --> 03:53.634
And I could.

03:55.065 --> 03:57.708
I glued my niece's pet duck
to the ceiling once.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.710
It was a low ceiling,
so every time someone
walked by

03:59.710 --> 04:01.141
I had to say, "duck."

04:01.141 --> 04:02.573
You see, the thing about
working with adhesives...

04:02.573 --> 04:04.315
Marci, is there
a point to this story?

04:04.315 --> 04:05.516
Yes, ducks bite.

04:07.678 --> 04:09.550
Also, if you want
to dissolve that glue,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.352
you should use
a non-polar alkane.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.724
Are you saying the
polarizability will be key

04:13.724 --> 04:15.225
in determining
the correct energy density?

04:15.225 --> 04:17.226
That is what I'm saying.

04:17.226 --> 04:20.591
I just think anything
worth saying is
worth saying with ducks.

04:20.591 --> 04:23.394
Marci, you might be
on to something
with the non-polar alkanes.

04:23.394 --> 04:26.737
I'm impressed.
Thanks, Barry.
I'm glad I stopped by.

04:26.737 --> 04:28.739
I'll start stirring
in the alkanes.

04:28.739 --> 04:29.540
Barry, come here!

04:31.342 --> 04:33.103
I think Marci likes you.

04:33.103 --> 04:34.875
Renaldo, people
don't just like me.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.347
I'm an acquired taste.

04:36.347 --> 04:38.679
Like music, fruit,
and roller coasters.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.650
Everyone likes those.

04:39.650 --> 04:41.452
Then perhaps
everyone likes me.

04:42.613 --> 04:45.886
But Marci doesn't just
like you, she "likes" you.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.518
Why else would she
come over here?

04:47.518 --> 04:49.660
Marci is here because
she likes science.

04:49.660 --> 04:53.263
And why wouldn't she,
with all the trial and error
and risk of imminent death.

04:55.265 --> 04:56.697
Check it out, Barry.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.529
It looks like
the molecular bonds vanished,

04:58.529 --> 05:01.672
just like my Uncle Hutch
every time Aunt Jenny
asks him to do the dishes.

05:01.672 --> 05:02.773
He's a magician,

05:02.773 --> 05:04.675
who hates doing the dishes.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.408
The molecular bonds vanished?

05:07.408 --> 05:09.009
What does that mean, Barry?

05:09.009 --> 05:11.812
Marci has discovered
that the adhesive polymer
is not permanent.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.844
So now I'm just a guy
hugging a table?

05:15.686 --> 05:17.388
Huh, what do you know?

05:18.549 --> 05:19.850
Do you know
what this means?

05:19.850 --> 05:22.052
I've invented temporary glue!

05:22.052 --> 05:25.796
Now, if I can only manipulate
the molecules to control
the time variable,

05:25.796 --> 05:27.498
this could have
countless applications.

05:27.498 --> 05:28.929

05:28.929 --> 05:30.661
I'd be happy
to help you with that,

05:30.661 --> 05:32.733
but my cousin Trent
got stuck in the couch again.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.665
He goes in there
hunting for crumbs.

05:34.665 --> 05:36.106
Also, he's not
really my cousin.

05:36.106 --> 05:38.038
He's a gopher.
I'll see you soon.

05:40.671 --> 05:43.313
I told you she likes you.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.620
Let us go,
you filthy goons!

05:49.620 --> 05:50.851
What she means
to say is,

05:50.851 --> 05:53.884
"Please, let us go,
you filthy goons!"

05:53.884 --> 05:56.727
Why are you doing this?
Who do you work for?

05:57.728 --> 05:59.089
I think we're about
to find out.

06:01.231 --> 06:02.863
It's the janitor!

06:02.863 --> 06:05.536
Of course!
That makes perfect sense!

06:06.797 --> 06:07.938
It's Janet Smythe!

06:07.938 --> 06:09.770

even more sense!

06:10.901 --> 06:13.073
What is going on here?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.806
There are going to be

at GDD the whole time!

At some point in the future,
this is gonna happen to us!

We have to stop her.

06:38.068 --> 06:39.169
How?

06:39.169 --> 06:40.871
She's not only a monster,

06:40.871 --> 06:42.733
she's also one of the most
powerful monsters
in the world.

06:42.733 --> 06:45.335

that nobody else has.

And Barry.

Let me get this straight.
You still went
to the janitor first?

07:03.153 --> 07:04.895
But we're here
now, Barry.

07:04.895 --> 07:06.797
So what do you know
about Janet Smythe?

07:06.797 --> 07:10.000
Well, I know that in college,
she developed
a mathematical analysis

07:10.000 --> 07:12.603
of consistent substrata
in compiler language.

07:12.603 --> 07:16.837
Yeah, yeah, the janitor
already told us that.
What else you got?

07:16.837 --> 07:19.910
I assume you know
the most famous story
about Janet Smythe

07:19.910 --> 07:20.771
that everyone knows.

07:20.771 --> 07:22.272
Assume we don't.

07:22.272 --> 07:24.274
And assume we're too lazy
to look it up online.

07:24.274 --> 07:26.817
It's one of my favorite
business success stories,

07:26.817 --> 07:29.850
second only to the legend
of Arturo Maximoff,

07:29.850 --> 07:32.553
the man who monetized
his mathematical analysis

07:32.553 --> 07:34.925
of non-consistent substrata
in compiler language.

07:34.925 --> 07:37.457
Yeah, yeah, the janitor
rambled on about him too!

07:37.457 --> 07:39.089
I like this janitor guy.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.732
Get to Janet Smythe.

07:41.732 --> 07:44.064
Yeah, we need an origin story
and we need it now.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.867
Well, it's one of those
classic eureka moments,

07:46.867 --> 07:48.969
like when the apple hit
Isaac Newton on the head,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.100
inspiring his
theory of gravity.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.772
Oh, I get it.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.003
Like when I dripped
chocolate sauce on my pasta,

07:53.003 --> 07:55.075
inspiring my theory of
fudge-sketti and meatballs.

07:56.707 --> 07:57.948
Shelby, I'm going
to talk to you now.

08:00.210 --> 08:04.214
Janet Smythe was a young
inventor when she received
a shock from a loose wire.

08:04.214 --> 08:06.857
It led her to realize that
the future of technology

08:06.857 --> 08:09.019
lay in
wireless connectivity.

08:09.019 --> 08:11.361
So if that didn't happen,
there'd be no GloboDigiDyne?

08:11.361 --> 08:12.763
Exactly.

08:12.763 --> 08:14.965
You can read
all about it in her
unauthorized biography,

08:14.965 --> 08:16.496
Don't You Dare
 Write a Book About Me.

08:17.928 --> 08:20.000
Thanks for the info, Barry.
And thanks for the book.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.872
Be careful with that.
It's autographed,

08:21.872 --> 08:23.974
"Why would I sign this?
Love, Janet."

08:25.005 --> 08:28.038
Aw, she dots her i's
with cute little skulls.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.645
Barry, I just got off
the phone.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.116
Then why are you
still on the phone?

08:37.116 --> 08:39.318
Oh, I'm not on the phone.
The phone's on me.

08:40.991 --> 08:44.254
Renaldo, you have got
to stop messing around
with my adhesive.

08:44.254 --> 08:46.827
Now, do you like
your bandages ripped off
fast or slow?

08:46.827 --> 08:47.928
Fast.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.329
Ow!

08:49.329 --> 08:52.803
But I like my phones
ripped off slow!

08:52.803 --> 08:56.536
Anyway, I was talking
to Marci and she said
she'll be back soon.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.708
Yes, she said
that earlier.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.941
And you two can work
on your chemistry.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.412
Yes, there is a lot of
chemistry involved.

09:02.412 --> 09:04.074
Yeah, there is.

09:04.074 --> 09:05.145
I already agreed with you.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.317
Uh-huh.

09:07.317 --> 09:09.950
This is about you insinuating
that she likes me, isn't it?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.181
Oh, yeah.

09:12.422 --> 09:14.124
Well, you're wrong.

09:14.124 --> 09:18.528
Our relationship is based
purely on a mutual
appreciation of science.

09:18.528 --> 09:20.060
You know what,
I'll prove it to you,

09:20.060 --> 09:21.992
by conducting an experiment
wherein Marci and I

09:21.992 --> 09:24.134
do nothing but sit
in my kitchen
eating pizza rolls.

09:24.134 --> 09:27.067
And you'll see that
without science,
she will have no interest.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.299
Pizza rolls.
Will you stop that?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.344
I'm sorry we can't
hang out in the kitchen.

09:34.344 --> 09:36.847
My mother is having
her book club meeting
in the house.

09:36.847 --> 09:37.948
I'm sorry we have
to sit on the ground.

09:37.948 --> 09:40.310
There's a woeful
lack of outdoor tables.

09:40.310 --> 09:43.483
And a blown fuse has
caused me to resort
to frontiersman lighting.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.484
I'm sorry.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.517
Look, Barry.
A meteor shower.

09:47.517 --> 09:49.660
I know. And I'm sorry.
It's very distracting.

09:50.921 --> 09:54.094
Also, my mother used up
all the pizza rolls
for her book club,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.326
so I had to whip up
some beef Wellington.

09:56.326 --> 09:57.928
I'm sorry,
it's the only dish
I can make.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.031
I, I don't know what to say.

10:01.031 --> 10:02.532
Please don't say anything.

10:02.532 --> 10:05.175
I already feel
horrible enough about
everything going wrong.

10:05.175 --> 10:07.978
Speaking of which,
I forgot that I have
a violin recital tomorrow

10:07.978 --> 10:09.710
and I need to practice.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.312
(PLAYING VIOLIN)

10:17.117 --> 10:18.118
I'm sorry.

10:26.997 --> 10:28.759
This is perfect, Cyd.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.731
We know how
GDD was founded.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.233
Now we can stop it
from happening.

10:33.233 --> 10:37.137
It says here Janet got
shocked and came up with
the idea that started GDD

10:37.137 --> 10:39.069
on August 27, 1991.

10:39.069 --> 10:40.310
Then that's where we go.

10:40.310 --> 10:42.212
But we gotta be careful.
She's ruthless.

10:42.212 --> 10:43.974
She whacked the shins
of her own head of security.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.976
Everyone knows you
don't shin-whack a dude.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.347
You gut punch him.

10:48.478 --> 10:49.950
She's gotta be stopped.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.422
No GDD.
No us strapped to tables.

10:52.422 --> 10:53.784
This is it.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.085
The moment when
we take a stand,

10:55.085 --> 10:57.357
jump back and stop
Janet Smythe from
forming GDD.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.329
So we're doing this.
We're doing this.

10:59.329 --> 11:01.932
I love these
call-to-action moments
we've been having lately.

11:01.932 --> 11:02.993
Very exciting.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.268
All right,
we're in 1991.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.500
We better stick together
so we don't forget each other

11:10.500 --> 11:12.502
like we did when
we went back to the '70s.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.247
Look, there's Janet.

11:17.247 --> 11:18.678
How do
we know that's her?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.181
What do you mean you
won't deliver a pizza to me?

11:21.181 --> 11:24.054
The last delivery guy
was poking around my garage.

11:24.054 --> 11:26.186
Of course
I shin-whacked him!

11:26.186 --> 11:27.287
So, clearly that's Janet.

11:32.222 --> 11:33.894
How does
she get shocked?

11:33.894 --> 11:35.926
The book said
it was a lamp.

11:35.926 --> 11:37.067
Ow!

11:37.067 --> 11:40.070
Stupid lamp with
your stupid wires!

11:40.070 --> 11:44.034
When will someone come up
with a technology that
requires no wires?

11:44.034 --> 11:45.605
(GASPS)

11:45.605 --> 11:47.677
Of course!

11:47.677 --> 11:49.379
Wireless technology!

11:50.280 --> 11:52.082
Aw!

11:52.082 --> 11:53.213
I'm sorry I hurt you.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.749
That's the moment
that started GDD.

11:58.749 --> 12:01.792
All we have to do now
is zorp back to before
she gets into the garage

12:01.792 --> 12:03.053
and stop it from happening.

12:05.195 --> 12:07.157
Okay, let's go
get rid of that lamp.

12:07.157 --> 12:08.458
Easy.

12:08.458 --> 12:09.960
(ALARM SOUNDING)

12:14.264 --> 12:16.006

(BOTH CONTINUE SCREAMING)

12:25.645 --> 12:26.646
(BEEPING)

12:27.948 --> 12:29.449
I know why you're here.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.052
You do?

12:32.052 --> 12:34.324
You're here
to steal my ideas.

12:34.324 --> 12:35.555
But I'm not gonna let you.

12:37.027 --> 12:39.629
BOTH: (REPEATING)
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

12:41.561 --> 12:42.963
That woman's got issues!

12:42.963 --> 12:46.496
She's been
shin-whackin' since '91!

12:46.496 --> 12:48.398
That must be what
triggered the gates.

12:48.398 --> 12:50.440
SHELBY: It's some
kind of laser sensor.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.042
Let's go this way
and get to the lamp.

12:55.105 --> 12:56.106
(BEEPING)

12:57.547 --> 12:59.609
(ALARM BLARING)
Uh-oh.

13:01.151 --> 13:04.214
(SCREAMS) No! No!

13:04.214 --> 13:05.355
Let's get out of here!

13:07.818 --> 13:09.059
What's going on?

13:09.059 --> 13:11.091
Why aren't we jumping?
I don't know!

13:12.923 --> 13:14.424
What do you think
you're doing in my workshop?

13:14.424 --> 13:16.066
It's not what you think.

13:16.066 --> 13:17.397
We're not trying
to steal your ideas,

13:17.397 --> 13:19.970
we're trying to prevent
you from becoming
incredibly successful!

13:19.970 --> 13:21.431
You're not helping!

13:26.106 --> 13:27.978
Why was there a delay
in our jump?

13:27.978 --> 13:30.140
I don't know. This has
never happened before.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.212
What's different?

13:32.212 --> 13:34.184
This is the first time
we've ever jumped more than
once out of our lifetimes.

13:34.184 --> 13:35.545
Maybe it caused
some kind of glitch.

13:35.545 --> 13:37.848
I hope it doesn't happen
again, we're so close.

13:37.848 --> 13:40.090
We just have to avoid
the trip laser
and the camera.

13:40.090 --> 13:41.221
This garage isn't that big.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.854
There can't possibly
be any more traps.

13:43.854 --> 13:45.395
There were more traps!

13:45.395 --> 13:47.757
Why did we step
on that glowing floor tile?

13:47.757 --> 13:50.030
CYD: It wasn't glowing
until we stepped on it!

13:52.802 --> 13:54.204
Who are you?

13:54.204 --> 13:56.266
How did you get past
the first five booby traps?

13:56.266 --> 13:58.969
Five?
Apparently three
were luck.

13:58.969 --> 14:00.911
Feeling lucky now?

14:00.911 --> 14:02.612
Come on,
let's get out of here!

14:02.612 --> 14:04.244
Oh, no,
it's happening again!

14:04.244 --> 14:05.715
Come on, come on,
come on!

14:05.715 --> 14:07.918
This is what you get
when you mess with me.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.649
There are severe
consequences!

14:11.321 --> 14:13.553
It wasn't a glitch.
We're losing our power!

14:13.553 --> 14:16.156
Maybe we can only
jump so many times
outside of our lifetime

14:16.156 --> 14:17.857
before our power is drained.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.789
What if we only
have one jump left?

14:26.897 --> 14:29.169
Good news, Barry.
I'm not stuck to anything.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.741
You got adhesive on
your hands, didn't you?

14:31.741 --> 14:33.303
Why would you ask that?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.277
Because you're holding
your hands in the air.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.249
I'm just testing
my deodorant.

14:39.249 --> 14:40.150
(SNIFFS)

14:40.150 --> 14:42.252
Yep, still not wearin' any.

14:42.252 --> 14:45.085
So, looks like you and Marci
are really hitting it off.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.456
Nonsense.

14:46.456 --> 14:48.258
In fact, I came in here
to report that the experiment

14:48.258 --> 14:51.491
has proceeded apace
and there has been no evidence
of Marci's interest.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.324
I don't think so, Barry.
Check this out.

14:54.324 --> 14:57.497
I set up your camera equipment
to collect objective data
on your experiment,

14:57.497 --> 14:58.828
like you always do.

14:58.828 --> 15:00.830
Renaldo, you invaded
my privacy,

15:00.830 --> 15:04.304
putting the scientific method
above personal decency.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.406
I'm so impressed.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.308
Marci is clearly
having a good time.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.479
Check this out.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.012
(BOTH SLURP)

15:12.012 --> 15:14.514
We only had one
milkshake glass. I'm sorry.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.447
I'm fine with it.

15:17.447 --> 15:19.849
My mom says
sharing brings
our family together,

15:19.849 --> 15:21.851
which is why we have
the Community Spoon.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.655
NALDO:
Just look at her smile.

15:25.655 --> 15:27.657
People smile
all the time, Renaldo.

15:27.657 --> 15:30.430
And nobody knows why.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.034
I know why. I found
what would call an
"unexpected result,"

15:34.034 --> 15:36.306
and I would call
a "what?"

15:37.237 --> 15:39.069
Take a look at your face.

15:41.311 --> 15:43.313
NALDO: Right there.
See your eyes?

15:43.313 --> 15:44.614
They're twinkling.

15:44.614 --> 15:46.946
That's candlelight reflecting
off my corneas.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.019
In science terms, maybe.

15:49.019 --> 15:50.850
But this is
about the heart.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.152
You like her.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.553
Is that possible?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.525
Barry, you can't
deny the evidence.

15:55.525 --> 15:56.926
You got it bad.

15:56.926 --> 15:59.029
Sweet shuds,
maybe I do.

15:59.729 --> 16:01.061
But now what?

16:01.061 --> 16:03.293
What am I supposed
to say to Marci about this?

16:03.293 --> 16:04.394
It's easy, Barry.

16:04.394 --> 16:06.466
Just go out there
and tell her how you feel.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.439
The important thing is
to be yourself.

16:09.439 --> 16:11.501
Your hand is glued
to my hoodie and shirt,
isn't it?

16:14.344 --> 16:16.006
What do we do now?

16:16.006 --> 16:18.048
The polymer won't
wear off for hours!

16:18.048 --> 16:19.349
Just take those off.

16:19.349 --> 16:21.511
Lucky for us,
your tuxedo is right here.

16:21.511 --> 16:23.883
I got it dry-cleaned
after I got mustard on it
from my corndog.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.956
Renaldo, why were you eating
a corndog in my tuxedo?

16:26.956 --> 16:29.089
'Cause I wasn't gonna
eat a corndog naked.

16:31.261 --> 16:32.662
It's really my fault
for asking.

16:33.623 --> 16:35.725
Come on, put this on.

16:35.725 --> 16:38.598
Your hand is glued
to my tux jacket
and shirt now, isn't it?

16:42.202 --> 16:43.973
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

16:49.179 --> 16:50.540
Renaldo, will you
turn off that music off?

16:50.540 --> 16:51.911
It's killing the moment.

16:52.782 --> 16:54.884
Sorry, Barry. It's my jam.

16:58.048 --> 17:00.920
Barry, you've been acting
so different lately.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.492
And that outfit,

17:02.492 --> 17:04.394
you look like
you're dressed for
the fancy beach.

17:05.454 --> 17:07.656
Ooh, it's so cold out here.

17:07.656 --> 17:09.959
It's amazing how
little coverage
this bow tie provides.

17:10.859 --> 17:12.462
Here, put this on.

17:15.105 --> 17:16.435
It's so soft.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.510
Marci, there's something
I need to tell you.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.473
I thought... Well...

17:23.473 --> 17:25.075
I mean...

17:25.075 --> 17:27.176
What I'm trying
to say is...

17:27.176 --> 17:29.319
You and I, here...

17:29.819 --> 17:30.820
Good.

17:32.582 --> 17:35.355
Huh?

17:35.355 --> 17:39.459
I hypothesized that our
relationship was based solely
on a shared love of science,

17:39.459 --> 17:41.961
but this evening has led me
to an unexpected result.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.494
Barry, your hypothesis
was right.

17:44.494 --> 17:47.066
Our relationship was
all about science.

17:47.997 --> 17:49.499
Oh.

17:49.499 --> 17:52.372
But this evening
has shown me
a whole new side of you.

17:53.403 --> 17:54.304
I like you, too.

17:55.445 --> 17:57.307
So what do we do now?

17:57.307 --> 18:00.550
I don't know about you,
but I'mma go with it.

18:00.550 --> 18:03.413
Yes, Marci, I am going
to go with it too.

18:03.413 --> 18:04.654
I'mma go with it.

18:04.654 --> 18:07.016
I am going to go with it.
We'll work on that.

18:12.021 --> 18:13.863
Okay, we have
to make this count, Cyd.

18:13.863 --> 18:15.695
Because we may
only have one time jump left

18:15.695 --> 18:17.096
and we'll need
that to get home.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.229
Right. We have to get
past these booby traps

18:19.229 --> 18:21.401
and get that lamp
so Janet doesn't get shocked.

Yeah, the ones
we know about.

all the booby traps
we don't know about.

is take care of that lamp.

I had a wonderful time, Barry,
but I have to go home.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.748
Gotta dress up as
a girl Sasquatch

20:18.748 --> 20:20.590
and traipse through
the woods behind my house.

20:20.590 --> 20:25.395
It calms my Pop Pop
to think that there's
a lady out there for Bigfoot.

20:25.395 --> 20:28.998
That's okay. I gotta fill
the hot tub with solvent
and dunk Renaldo.

20:28.998 --> 20:30.430
We're both busy people.

20:34.364 --> 20:35.365
So.

20:36.266 --> 20:37.267
So.

20:45.715 --> 20:48.448
I'll show you
what I do to people
who try to steal from me.

20:50.420 --> 20:51.621
(GRUNTS)

20:51.621 --> 20:53.383
(ALARM SOUNDING)

20:54.484 --> 20:56.185
Nice shot, Cyd!

20:57.186 --> 20:58.688
You can't do this!

20:58.688 --> 21:01.431
I'll find you,
no matter how long it takes!

21:01.431 --> 21:02.692
It's working!
Yes!

21:02.692 --> 21:03.933
What's working?

21:03.933 --> 21:05.765
What are you
doing over there?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.567
Do you think this'll change
anything else in the future?

21:07.567 --> 21:08.598
It's a risk
we have to take.

21:08.598 --> 21:09.699
Come on!

21:09.699 --> 21:11.040
(BOTH GRUNTING)

21:26.956 --> 21:29.959
Renaldo, I don't care
if that movie was called
 Crab-normal Behavior.

21:29.959 --> 21:32.091
Crabs in the wild would
never behave like that.

21:32.091 --> 21:36.766
But Barry, the captain
clearly said they
weren't actin' right.

21:36.766 --> 21:39.729
That's the last time
I crowdfund a movie without
reading the script first.

21:41.270 --> 21:42.772
Hiya, fellas.

21:42.772 --> 21:44.604
Can I interest
either of you in
a subscription to

21:44.604 --> 21:46.406
Lemon-Lime
 Soft Drink Magazine?

21:46.406 --> 21:48.408
It's the only
self-published magazine

21:48.408 --> 21:50.279
devoted to the
lemon-lime lifestyle.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.744
I don't know
what to say to that.

21:54.744 --> 21:57.146
Sorry, Marci, I'm not
really a lemon-lime guy.

21:57.146 --> 21:58.848
Oh, me neither.
I hate the stuff.

21:58.848 --> 22:01.020
But I love
the lifestyle.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.656
Man, that girl Marci
is really out there, huh?

22:06.656 --> 22:07.927
She's actually pretty nice.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.099
I bet you'd really
like her if you got
to know her better.

22:10.099 --> 22:12.331
I don't think so.
A little too weird for me.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.464
Now let's go sit
on those snake eggs
until they hatch

22:14.464 --> 22:16.235
and see if they accept
us as their parents

22:16.235 --> 22:19.308
or turn on us
like we're regular people
sitting on snake eggs.

22:29.519 --> 22:32.952
All right, Cyd, let's see
if we changed anything?

22:34.524 --> 22:35.785
Cyd? Where are you?

22:36.826 --> 22:38.287
Where am I?

22:41.160 --> 22:43.763
Alaska?
That can't be right.

22:52.141 --> 22:53.403
Nope. It's Alaska.

22:54.704 --> 22:56.746
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

22:56.746 --> 22:59.849
Cyd, something went wrong
when we changed Janet's past!

22:59.849 --> 23:03.082
You think? I'm living
with my parents in Peru!

23:10.089 --> 23:14.794
Cyd, we created a timeline
where I live in Alaska
and you live in Peru!

23:14.794 --> 23:16.566
At least we got rid
of GloboDigiDyne.

23:16.566 --> 23:18.868
There's nothing online
about it or Janet Smythe.

23:18.868 --> 23:20.029
So we did it.

23:20.029 --> 23:22.301
We stopped her
from founding GDD!

23:22.301 --> 23:25.775
Also, in this timeline,
instead of Diesel,
I think I have a pet llama!

23:29.038 --> 23:31.140
Well, be careful,
'cause llamas spit.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.141
(SPIT SPLATTERING)

23:34.383 --> 23:36.516
Ech! Not cool, llama.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.019
Oh, wait, there's Diesel.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.792
Oh, no, I think he has
a thing for this llama.

23:42.792 --> 23:45.855
He's wearing his spiky
bad boy collar and making
his flirt face.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.061
This is so messed up.

23:52.061 --> 23:54.934
We stopped
the future lab, but now
we don't live together.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.836
Maybe because
 we got rid of GDD,

23:56.836 --> 23:59.839
my dad didn't have
 a job in Portland
 to keep us there.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.912
I gotta talk to my dad
and find out how
I ended up in Alaska.

24:02.912 --> 24:05.815
But I gotta play it cool
so he won't be suspicious.

24:05.815 --> 24:07.246
(SCREAMS) Dad!

24:08.978 --> 24:10.249
I'll call you back.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.351
Shelby,
is everything okay?

24:12.351 --> 24:15.985
Oh, the way you screamed,
I thought you were being
attacked by a bear again.

24:15.985 --> 24:17.587
I've been attacked by a bear?

24:17.587 --> 24:18.758
Shelby, it's Alaska.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.429
We've all been
attacked by bears.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.964
Dad, this might sound like
a weird question,

24:24.964 --> 24:26.065
but why did we
leave Portland?

24:26.065 --> 24:28.137
You know I couldn't
find a job there.

24:28.137 --> 24:29.969
It's been seven
years already.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.971
Your mother let it go,
why can't you?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.102
(SIGHS)

24:33.102 --> 24:35.104
We'd still be
in Portland if only...

24:35.104 --> 24:37.446
Ah, forget it.
I've told you this story
a hundred times.

24:37.446 --> 24:40.550
No, no. No, no.
Tell it again.
It's my favorite story.

24:40.550 --> 24:42.752
Your favorite story is about
the day my car broke down

24:42.752 --> 24:43.983
and I missed
the big job interview

24:43.983 --> 24:45.755
that would have kept
our family in Portland?

24:45.755 --> 24:48.017
Love that story.
And the way you tell it.

24:48.017 --> 24:49.188
Pure Norm.

24:50.419 --> 24:53.262
If only I'd taken your
mother's car that day.

24:53.262 --> 24:55.765
Well, I'm gonna
shovel the driveway.

24:55.765 --> 24:57.697
For the third time today.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.698
It's June.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.473
Cyd's not going
to believe this.

25:04.473 --> 25:05.805
CYD: Heard it!

25:07.006 --> 25:08.608
Cyd?
You never hung up.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.080
So you heard my dad say
we were all attacked by bears?

25:11.080 --> 25:13.613
This timeline hasn't been
kind to either of us.

25:13.613 --> 25:14.744
I have braids!

25:16.986 --> 25:18.087
Here's what I'm thinking.

25:18.087 --> 25:19.448
We jump back to third grade,

25:19.448 --> 25:21.050
make sure my dad
uses my mom's car

25:21.050 --> 25:22.852
to go to his interview,
he gets the job,

25:22.852 --> 25:24.954
I stay in Portland and
everything's back to normal.

25:24.954 --> 25:27.096
And no future lab at GDD.

25:27.096 --> 25:29.929
But Shelbs, we need to be
together to time travel.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.160
There's only one thing to do.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.563
I'll come to Peru.
I'll come to Alaska.

25:33.563 --> 25:36.465
BOTH: We'll meet in Portland.

25:36.465 --> 25:38.968
I'll tell my parents
that I wanna spend
the summer in Portland

25:38.968 --> 25:40.570
training to be a barista.

25:40.570 --> 25:44.443
They've always wanted
a barista in the family,
so it's gotta work.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.546
And I'll tell my parents
that your parents are getting
you a plane ticket,

25:47.546 --> 25:49.418
which will guilt them
into getting me one, too.

25:49.418 --> 25:52.281
Like that time I told
my dad that your dad
got you a dirt bike.

25:52.281 --> 25:53.552
I never got a dirt bike.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.154
I did. See you in Portland!

26:02.692 --> 26:05.494
You know, it says
here in this Lemon-Lime
 Soft Drink Magazine

26:05.494 --> 26:09.038
that all people can be
categorized as either
a lemon or a lime.

26:09.038 --> 26:10.269
That's ridiculous.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.642
And don't say
that makes me a lime.

26:12.642 --> 26:13.773
You wish you were a lime.

26:15.404 --> 26:18.978
You should have never
taken that magazine
from that weird girl Marci.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.650
I don't know, Barry,

26:20.650 --> 26:22.852
the more I think about it,
the more I think Marci
might be your type.

26:22.852 --> 26:24.954
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I do not have a type.

26:24.954 --> 26:26.986
And if I did, it certainly
wouldn't be Marci.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.018
It would be someone
who's into science,

26:29.018 --> 26:32.021
like, uh, I don't know,
that girl in the lab coat.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.925
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

26:41.000 --> 26:42.271
(DISTORTED VOICE)
Marci?

27:03.492 --> 27:05.895
These were... I...

27:05.895 --> 27:07.296
You glasses!

27:09.959 --> 27:10.900
Thanks, Barry.

27:13.602 --> 27:17.106
Renaldo, is it possible
Marci could be my type?

27:17.106 --> 27:19.168
You should talk
to her and see if
there's something there.

27:19.168 --> 27:21.640
I don't know the first thing
about matters of the heart.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.472
What do I do?
You're good with girls.

27:23.472 --> 27:25.044
I don't know about that.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.016
Hi, Amber.
Stacey, Claire, Tina.

27:27.016 --> 27:28.918
(ALL GIGGLE)

27:28.918 --> 27:31.250
I'm pretty sure those
aren't their names,
but they never correct me.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.553
Teach me
everything you know.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.126
Okay, did you know
unicycles don't have brakes?

27:37.126 --> 27:39.228
Teach me everything
you know about girls.

27:43.763 --> 27:45.664
Cyd, call me
when you get this.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.997
I'm at my old house.

27:47.997 --> 27:49.799
I was going to wait
at the airport but they said
no waiting in the red zone.

27:49.799 --> 27:51.340
So I went to the white zone.

27:51.340 --> 27:53.502
But that was for loading
and unloading, and I wasn't
doing either of those.

27:53.502 --> 27:54.974
So I went to the blue zone.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.846
But that was for buses,
so I got on one and here I am.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.152
Barry! Naldo! I missed
you guys so much!

28:03.152 --> 28:04.914
Who are you and why
are you hugging me?

28:04.914 --> 28:06.355
Barry, when a random
girl hugs you,

28:06.355 --> 28:08.157
the two things you
don't say are,
"Why are you hugging me?"

28:08.157 --> 28:09.458
And "Who are you?"

28:09.458 --> 28:11.020
Those are the least
important parts of a hug.

28:12.221 --> 28:14.724
It's me, Shelby.
I used to live here

28:14.724 --> 28:16.665
in the third grade
before I moved to Alaska.

28:16.665 --> 28:18.227
Shelby, that's right.
I remember you.

28:18.227 --> 28:19.999
Oh, thank goodness!
(GROANS)

28:19.999 --> 28:21.330
You're getting
a second hug!

28:21.330 --> 28:23.172
Now, say something
nice about her.

28:23.172 --> 28:26.736
Your hair smells
like it hasn't been
washed recently.

28:26.736 --> 28:28.477
I mean, your eyes
are where they should be.

28:30.079 --> 28:31.981
It's just so good
to see you guys.

28:31.981 --> 28:33.342
It's like I never left.

28:33.342 --> 28:34.643
But thank goodness
you did.

28:34.643 --> 28:36.085
'Cause the person who
bought your house

28:36.085 --> 28:38.948
is really into science
and has kinda
become my mentor.

28:38.948 --> 28:41.951
It is so much better
than when you lived here.

28:41.951 --> 28:43.522
I mean, it's great
to see you too.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.156
Really?

28:47.156 --> 28:49.198
'Cause in the timeline
where I lived here,
you invented time travel.

28:49.198 --> 28:51.630
So whose timeline's
better now?

28:51.630 --> 28:53.032
(SOFTLY) I don't know
what to say to that.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.165
Barry, let me handle this.

28:57.106 --> 28:59.408
That sounds great, Shelby.

28:59.408 --> 29:01.470
You seem very normal.

29:01.470 --> 29:05.314
I'm not afraid
of talking to you at all.

29:05.314 --> 29:06.816
And then
back away slowly.

29:09.518 --> 29:11.921
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

29:11.921 --> 29:13.182
Cyd, where are you?

29:13.182 --> 29:14.723
CYD: On the way.
 Couldn't catch a plane,

29:14.723 --> 29:17.286
but my grandparents
 gave me their tickets
 for a cruise.

29:17.286 --> 29:20.089
They were non-transferable,
 so Diesel and I are traveling

29:20.089 --> 29:21.230
as Grandma
 and Grandpa Ripley.

29:25.234 --> 29:27.396
Do people really believe
Diesel's an old man?

29:27.396 --> 29:29.638
They believe I believe it,
and that's all that matters.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.473
I gotta tell you, Cyd,
it's really weird here.

29:34.473 --> 29:38.707
Barry and Naldo don't know
me and someone else
lives in my house.

29:38.707 --> 29:41.080
(SIGHS) I wonder what
it looks like in there.

29:49.188 --> 29:53.262
Cyd, I think Janet Smythe
lives in my old house!

29:58.227 --> 30:00.629
Janet Smythe lives
in your old house?

30:00.629 --> 30:01.971
How is that possible?

30:01.971 --> 30:04.573
I don't know,
but her picture's
all over the place.

30:04.573 --> 30:06.175
What if she sees us
and remembers us

30:06.175 --> 30:08.007
as the girls who trapped
her in her garage?

30:08.007 --> 30:09.879
For Janet,
that was 25 years ago.

30:09.879 --> 30:11.110
Maybe she doesn't remember.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.382
Yeah, but maybe she does.

30:13.382 --> 30:15.484
She's crazy.
I better get out of here.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.518
(GASPING)

30:19.518 --> 30:21.851
You scared me.
I mean, you startled me.

30:21.851 --> 30:24.623
There's no reason
to be scared, right?

30:24.623 --> 30:26.555
What are you doing
in my backyard?

30:26.555 --> 30:31.560
Um. There's a very good
explanation for that.
And that is...

30:31.560 --> 30:34.303
I used to live here.

30:34.303 --> 30:35.764
Wait, I did used
to live here.

30:35.764 --> 30:37.206
Why am I saying
that like I'm lying?

30:38.637 --> 30:40.369
I don't know.
(CHUCKLES)

30:40.369 --> 30:43.442
Well, I used to live here
and I just wanted to see
the old house.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.314
But now I have,
so I'll be going.

30:45.314 --> 30:47.116
Wait, you're not
going anywhere.

30:48.377 --> 30:49.879
You should see the house.

30:49.879 --> 30:52.381
Come in.
No, no, no, it's okay.

30:52.381 --> 30:54.884
But that's what you
came here for, isn't it?

30:54.884 --> 30:57.056
It is what
I came here for.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.228
So you should
come inside.

30:59.228 --> 31:01.230
Unless there's some
reason I'm not aware of.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.192
No. No, there's no reason.

31:03.192 --> 31:04.463
Well, then after you.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.165
So I guess
we're going inside.

31:13.402 --> 31:16.946
Renaldo, are you sure
this is the best way for me
to practice talking to Marci?

31:16.946 --> 31:18.407
NALDO: Barry, I'm sure.

31:22.251 --> 31:24.153
Okay. So, Marci...

31:24.153 --> 31:26.255
I can't do this.
Yeah, that got
weird really fast.

31:28.457 --> 31:30.659
I'm never going
to learn to talk
to Marci this way.

31:30.659 --> 31:32.461
You're good
at talking to girls.
What do you say to them?

31:32.461 --> 31:34.193
I don't know it
until I say it.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.694
I didn't know
I was gonna say that.

31:35.694 --> 31:36.795
Or that.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.827
Or ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny.

31:38.827 --> 31:40.529
Whoa, where did
that come from?

31:42.001 --> 31:43.532
Renaldo, I have an idea.

31:43.532 --> 31:46.175
I will observe you
in your natural habitat

31:46.175 --> 31:50.039
and document your actions
to determine just how
you connect with girls.

31:50.039 --> 31:51.380
NALDO: Sounds good, Barry.

31:51.380 --> 31:52.411
How'd you do that?

31:54.543 --> 31:55.945
Do what?

31:55.945 --> 31:57.486
Whoa, where'd you
come from?

31:59.588 --> 32:01.420
Isn't sitting on
a bench the best?

32:05.194 --> 32:07.396
Don't worry about him.
He's just watching us.

32:09.898 --> 32:12.831
When I was little,
I lost a toy fire truck
in my hair.

32:12.831 --> 32:14.263
If you find it,
you can keep it.

32:16.405 --> 32:18.937
(CLICKING)

32:18.937 --> 32:21.170
Don't worry. They're for
his personal use only.

32:23.372 --> 32:26.315
What if pyramids
are just sand icebergs?

32:26.315 --> 32:28.477
There could be a lot
more pyramid down there.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.881
Renaldo, that was amazing.

32:32.881 --> 32:34.883
I think I learned
everything I need
to know to talk to Marci.

32:34.883 --> 32:35.985
Thank you.

32:35.985 --> 32:37.226
I'm so proud of you, Barry.

32:38.727 --> 32:41.890
Uh, I think this is
supposed to be
a two-person hug.

32:41.890 --> 32:44.033
All right.
Can you give us a minute?

32:49.598 --> 32:51.740
There's Marci.
Wish me luck.

32:51.740 --> 32:53.142
Barry, wait.
One more thing.

32:54.303 --> 32:55.904
I want you to wear
my lucky hat.

32:55.904 --> 32:57.406
What makes
it your lucky hat?

32:57.406 --> 32:59.148
Because no matter what,
it always comes back.

33:01.550 --> 33:02.611
Wait for it.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.354
I don't know
how it happens.

33:07.356 --> 33:08.317
Go get her.

33:12.261 --> 33:13.322
Hey, Marci.

33:13.322 --> 33:15.394
Oh, hiya, Barry.
How's it going?

33:15.394 --> 33:17.126
Isn't sitting on
a bench the best?

33:17.126 --> 33:18.627
I think agriculture
is the best.

33:18.627 --> 33:20.099
Why are we talking
about this?

33:21.470 --> 33:23.102
A follow up question.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.503
I did not
anticipate that.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.475
Um...

33:26.475 --> 33:31.610
Now is the part, I think,
where you look in my hair
for a fire truck.

33:31.610 --> 33:34.283
Oh, your scalp looks
mighty nervous, Barry.

33:34.283 --> 33:35.244
I'll see you soon.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.287
Pyramids are sand icebergs!

33:38.287 --> 33:39.618
Pyramids are sand icebergs!

33:41.390 --> 33:42.391
So, how'd it go?

33:46.595 --> 33:47.756
It always comes back.

33:50.799 --> 33:52.831
SHELBY: No, Janet, no.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.833
I couldn't possibly
have another cookie.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.335
But they are so delicious.

33:58.467 --> 34:00.008
Shelby, you are so sweet.

34:00.008 --> 34:01.870
It's a delight
having you here.

34:01.870 --> 34:04.012
This is such a relief.

34:04.012 --> 34:06.145
I was really worried
you weren't going to be nice.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.576
What are you talking about?

34:07.576 --> 34:09.178
I'm talking about...

34:10.319 --> 34:11.449
Women's rights.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.081
You don't have
to be nice anymore.

34:13.081 --> 34:14.453
You can be nice,
you can be mean,

34:14.453 --> 34:15.623
you can be anything
you want to be!

34:15.623 --> 34:16.784
Up top, sister!

34:18.556 --> 34:19.858
You are adorable.

What did she do
to my room?

35:04.433 --> 35:05.604
Janet?

35:05.604 --> 35:07.776
I just wanted to say
thank you.

the moment I saw you.

for a long time.

35:36.064 --> 35:37.436
For 25 years,

35:37.436 --> 35:39.438
I've been searching
for the two teenage girls

35:39.438 --> 35:42.441
who broke into my lab
and tricked me into
one of my own booby traps.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.373
You're one of those girls.

35:44.373 --> 35:46.875
That couldn't be me.
It was 25 years ago.

35:46.875 --> 35:49.648
My security cameras
caught the whole thing.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.049
One moment you were there.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.252
And the next moment
you were gone.

35:53.252 --> 35:56.725
And so imagine my surprise
a quarter of a century later

35:56.725 --> 35:59.258
when you walk into my house
and you haven't aged a day.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.690
Janet, that doesn't
make any sense.
Think about it.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.362
I've done nothing
but think about it.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.334
And I think you're some
kind of time traveler.

36:05.334 --> 36:06.535
What do you have
to say to that?

36:06.535 --> 36:08.367
If I could time travel,

36:08.367 --> 36:10.639
don't you think I would have
traveled out of here by now?

36:10.639 --> 36:12.571
Perhaps you can't do it alone.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.244
Perhaps you need your friend.

36:16.705 --> 36:18.247
Where is she?

36:18.247 --> 36:21.079
What friend?
I have no friends.
I'm very unpopular.

36:57.446 --> 37:02.120
It was fate that I bought
your old house so I could
have my vengeance!

37:06.995 --> 37:09.698
Listen, Barry.
I've been thinking
about your problem.

37:09.698 --> 37:11.930
The fact that I'm a lone
insignificant being

37:11.930 --> 37:15.434
in the vast and infinite
uncaring expanse
of the cosmos?

37:15.434 --> 37:17.966
No, that's never
gonna change.

37:17.966 --> 37:20.038
So let's fix this thing
with you and Marci.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.571
I think your mistake
was you tried to act like me
around her.

37:22.571 --> 37:25.644
I tried to act like me
around her too,
and it didn't work either.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.846
I'm not good
at this romance stuff.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.848
Then don't try to do
the romance stuff.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.019
Do what you're good at.

37:31.019 --> 37:33.051
All I'm good
at is science.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.153
What am I supposed to do?
Talk to her about science

37:35.153 --> 37:36.985
because it's an interest
we both share?

37:36.985 --> 37:40.589
See what you did there.
You asked yourself a question
you had the answer to.

37:40.589 --> 37:42.731
That's the Naldo way, right?

37:42.731 --> 37:44.563
I know it's right.
That's the Naldo way.

37:46.435 --> 37:48.667
Yes! I'll connect
with Marci over science.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.770
My mentor Janet Smythe
has a lab in her attic.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.543
I'm sure Marci will be
impressed with that.
I'll take her there.

37:54.543 --> 37:55.974
And you'll come
with me for support.

37:55.974 --> 37:59.247
Barry, this is
your first date with Marci,

37:59.247 --> 38:02.811

waiting for you.

I've been searching for

right in front of me.

How do we keep ending up
strapped to tables?

39:06.815 --> 39:08.877
This is all my fault, Cyd.

39:08.877 --> 39:10.919
I never should have said
to meet at my old house.

39:10.919 --> 39:13.422
It's my fault too.
I should have known
she couldn't be trusted.

Enough, both of you!
It's my fault.

I trapped you here.
Stop trying to
take the credit!

39:19.628 --> 39:22.691
So the thing about
having a mentor who's
a brilliant scientist

39:22.691 --> 39:25.664
is that sometimes you get
to help out on some
pretty important...

39:25.664 --> 39:28.397
Janet, hey,
is this a bad time?

39:32.571 --> 39:35.774
Barry, did you know
your brilliant scientist
mentor was evil?

39:35.774 --> 39:37.606
No, that is
fresh information.

39:37.606 --> 39:38.747
Had I known that,
I would not have
brought you here.

39:38.747 --> 39:39.908
Thanks, I appreciate that.

39:41.109 --> 39:43.251
Cyd, Shelby,
what is going on here?

39:43.251 --> 39:44.683
It's a long story.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.354
We're time travelers
and Janet's crazy.

39:46.354 --> 39:49.518
Maybe it's not
that long of a story.

39:49.518 --> 39:52.290

is the secret of your power.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.722
We don't even know
how it works.

even if we wanted to.

no longer my mentor.

over there and distracted,

Maybe it'll loosen the ropes.

40:55.924 --> 40:57.155
I've been trying
to talk to you

40:57.155 --> 40:58.857
and I thought
our shared love of science

40:58.857 --> 40:59.728
would be a way to connect.

openin' up.

That's what I like
about you, Marci.
You're special.

41:18.046 --> 41:20.378
I like the way
the fluorescent lights
in the commons

41:20.378 --> 41:22.751
reflect off your glasses.

41:22.751 --> 41:27.485
And the way the sequins
in your beret sparkle
in the post-lunch sun.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.758
Why have you never said
any of this before?

41:29.758 --> 41:30.989
I guess sometimes it takes

41:30.989 --> 41:33.722
being tied to a bench
in a crazy lady's evil lab

41:33.722 --> 41:35.764

41:49.778 --> 41:50.809
This is beautiful.

41:50.809 --> 41:53.942
But if you guys
wanna kiss, I'm out.

41:56.945 --> 41:57.746
It's not working!

41:57.746 --> 41:59.918
I can't get out!
The ropes are too tight!

41:59.918 --> 42:01.349
Don't bother.
You're not going anywhere

42:01.349 --> 42:02.591
until I get what I need.

42:02.591 --> 42:04.322
The molecular disrupter
is ready.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.424
Come on, Shelby.
You're going first.

42:06.424 --> 42:07.756
Is this going to hurt?

42:07.756 --> 42:08.957
Only if you survive.

42:08.957 --> 42:11.529
No! I can't watch you
do this to her.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.931
Take me. I'll go first.

42:12.931 --> 42:14.362
Cyd, no. You don't have
to do that.

42:14.362 --> 42:15.964
Okay, you want to go first?
You can go first.

42:15.964 --> 42:17.035
No, Cyd, don't!

42:17.866 --> 42:20.038
Cyd, please, just don't!

42:20.038 --> 42:21.009
Get in the machine.

42:21.009 --> 42:22.771
(WHIRRING)

42:22.771 --> 42:23.872
Cyd!

42:23.872 --> 42:26.715
It'll be okay, Shelby.
It'll be okay.

42:26.715 --> 42:28.516
Stop! I'll do
whatever you want.

42:28.516 --> 42:29.818
Just please let Cyd go!

42:33.982 --> 42:35.123
I gotta do something.

42:36.585 --> 42:37.726
(BARKING)

42:37.726 --> 42:38.857
Diesel, you're here.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.088
We gotta save Cyd.

42:40.088 --> 42:42.691
I need something sharp
to cut these ropes.

42:42.691 --> 42:44.332
Your spiky bad boy collar.

42:44.332 --> 42:45.433
(GASPS)

42:46.194 --> 42:47.435
You're amazing, Diesel.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.239
(DISRUPTER WHIRRING)

42:53.371 --> 42:54.472
It's working.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.278
Not so fast.

43:10.619 --> 43:12.120
You put lasers in your lab?

43:12.120 --> 43:13.662
Of course I did.

43:13.662 --> 43:15.724
Twenty-five years ago,
I was attacked
in my own lab.

43:15.724 --> 43:17.225
Did you think I was going
to let you do that again?

43:21.900 --> 43:23.401
(GROANING)

43:25.634 --> 43:28.606
Stun lasers don't feel good,
do they?

43:28.606 --> 43:30.809
Give up and go back to
your table like a good girl.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.841
You're not gonna be able
to take another hit.

43:32.841 --> 43:34.643
(WAILING)

43:34.643 --> 43:35.814
I'm coming, Cyd!

43:37.445 --> 43:38.687
(GRUNTING)

43:47.055 --> 43:48.827
So close.

43:49.557 --> 43:50.659
Hurts, doesn't it?

43:51.159 --> 43:52.360
(BARKS)

43:52.360 --> 43:53.932
(SCREAMS) It's a giant rat!

43:55.503 --> 43:56.935
(GROWLING)

43:56.935 --> 43:58.066
Get away from me!

43:58.066 --> 43:59.808
(BARKS)
(SHRIEKS)

44:06.975 --> 44:08.576
Cyd, no!

44:08.576 --> 44:09.918
This can't be happening.

44:16.484 --> 44:17.986
(WHIMPERS)

44:17.986 --> 44:20.288
How sad for you.

44:20.288 --> 44:22.160
Getting through
all those lasers

44:22.160 --> 44:24.292
just to see
your friend like this.

44:24.292 --> 44:27.265
And there's nothing
you can do to save her.

44:27.265 --> 44:31.069
How could you?
She's my best friend!

44:31.069 --> 44:33.541
And now she's my answer
to time travel.

44:35.003 --> 44:36.404
Where is she?

44:36.404 --> 44:39.007
Right behind you,
you evil scrunch.

44:39.007 --> 44:40.548
(SCREAMS)

44:42.550 --> 44:44.182
Cyd, you're alive.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.084
That thing hurt.

44:46.084 --> 44:47.856
Now let's go back
to third grade,

44:47.856 --> 44:49.257
make sure your dad
gets your mom's car,

44:49.257 --> 44:51.089
and we'll both be living
in Portland.

44:51.089 --> 44:54.392
Cyd, we have bigger problems
than us living in Portland.

44:54.392 --> 44:56.995
Janet knows about us
from what we did in 1991,

44:56.995 --> 44:58.727
and she's obsessed
with finding us.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.069
We won't be safe.

45:01.069 --> 45:03.131
We have to go back and undo
what we did in her garage.

45:03.131 --> 45:05.734
But then she'll form GDD.
What about the future lab?

45:05.734 --> 45:07.075
We went through
all of this to stop it.

45:07.075 --> 45:09.177
We have no choice.

45:09.177 --> 45:12.841
We've created a timeline
that's way worse than
the future lab.

45:12.841 --> 45:14.843
You're right.
We need to fix it.

45:14.843 --> 45:16.144
Quick, untie us!

45:16.144 --> 45:17.615
Don't worry,
we're time travelers.

45:17.615 --> 45:18.947
When we reset this timeline,

45:18.947 --> 45:20.518
none of this will
have ever happened.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.190
But I just got Marci
to like me.

45:28.296 --> 45:29.798
There's Janet.

45:29.798 --> 45:31.860
Okay, she hasn't been shocked
by that lamp yet.

45:31.860 --> 45:33.832
All we have to do
is make sure
she gets the idea

45:33.832 --> 45:36.004
to invent wireless
and doesn't see us.

45:37.205 --> 45:38.036
Ow!

45:38.036 --> 45:41.039
Stupid lamp with
your stupid wires!

45:41.039 --> 45:44.572
When will someone come up
with a technology that
requires no wires?

45:44.572 --> 45:46.744
BOTH: Wireless.
Wireless. Wireless.

45:47.245 --> 45:48.777
Of course!

45:48.777 --> 45:50.218
Wireless technology!

45:50.218 --> 45:51.419
BOTH: Yes!

45:52.320 --> 45:53.481
I'm sorry I hurt you.

46:02.861 --> 46:05.433
I don't know how long we have
until this timeline resets.

46:05.433 --> 46:07.235
So we're gonna
forget all of this?

46:07.235 --> 46:08.566
We won't remember that
we like each other?

46:09.697 --> 46:12.140
I'm really sorry, Barry.

46:12.140 --> 46:15.443
No. I won't let it happen.
I'll remember you, Marci.

46:15.443 --> 46:17.145
I'll remember
that I like you.

46:18.046 --> 46:19.607
We will find each other.

46:27.715 --> 46:30.018
(SIGHS)
We're back.

46:30.018 --> 46:31.990
Oh, my gosh, Cyd,
Janet is nuts.

46:31.990 --> 46:33.922
But at least we're safe
and together.

46:36.965 --> 46:38.696
For now.

46:38.696 --> 46:40.298
But if people find out
about our power,

46:40.298 --> 46:41.629
they're going to
come after us.

46:41.629 --> 46:43.231
What about the future lab?

46:43.231 --> 46:45.233
We're back to the timeline
when we were strapped
to those tables.

46:45.233 --> 46:47.275
We'll figure
something else out.

46:47.275 --> 46:49.978
The important thing is
that Janet doesn't know
anything about us,

46:49.978 --> 46:52.440
and our trip to 1991
didn't make anything worse.

46:57.585 --> 46:59.047
What is that?

47:09.327 --> 47:11.960
I don't know what you are,

47:11.960 --> 47:14.202
but I'm gonna find out.

47:18.366 --> 47:19.707
Hiya, Barry!

47:19.707 --> 47:22.370
Are you doing
science experiments
in your lab today?

47:22.370 --> 47:24.342
Well, I can't do them
at the water park anymore

47:24.342 --> 47:26.174
after my experimental
algae dissolver

47:26.174 --> 47:27.575
also dissolved
bathing suits.

47:29.217 --> 47:30.478
Barry, you like Marci.

47:30.478 --> 47:31.880
Marci, you like Barry.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.751
Whew, we did it.
We made everything right.

47:33.751 --> 47:34.953
See you guys later!

48:01.980 --> 48:05.213
(BOTH BLOWING RASPBERRIES)

48:05.213 --> 48:07.185
I didn't know you guys
liked each other.
