00:01.039 --> 00:02.739
They're on their way
to you now.

00:02.745 --> 00:04.328
We'll be waiting for them.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.373
Put your hands up.

00:06.505 --> 00:08.023
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:08.106 --> 00:10.859
His name is David Robert Jones.

00:10.943 --> 00:12.978
He was looking for a mineral
named Amphilicite.

00:13.029 --> 00:15.264
Enough to blow a hole
in the universe.

00:15.331 --> 00:16.949
That tracker we had on Jones,

00:17.016 --> 00:18.483
how did he pinpoint

00:18.535 --> 00:20.869
the wavelength we were on
that quickly?

00:20.954 --> 00:22.871
Colonel Broyles,
we lost him.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.656
Roger that.

00:24.707 --> 00:26.825
You think someone
from our team told him?

00:26.876 --> 00:33.165
You have a better idea?

00:34.801 --> 00:35.968
Officer down!

00:36.035 --> 00:38.370
Who knew?
We've got to find out.

00:38.421 --> 00:40.055
Hey, Linc--Linc.

00:40.139 --> 00:45.727
I've been blown up before.
This is nothing.

00:45.812 --> 00:46.979
What's going on?

00:47.046 --> 00:50.449
Captain Lee,
he didn't make it.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:11.838 --> 01:13.922
I don't like funerals.

01:17.910 --> 01:20.512
I never know what
I'm supposed to say.

01:28.587 --> 01:31.356
There's nothing you can say.

01:58.784 --> 02:01.803
This isn't right.

02:01.888 --> 02:05.123
Our children aren't supposed
to die before we do.

02:09.228 --> 02:10.762
We are going to do
everything that we can

02:10.812 --> 02:13.565
to find who's responsible
and bring them to justice.

02:13.632 --> 02:17.769
<i>I give you my word.</i>

02:17.820 --> 02:19.637
Thank you.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.125
I'm rather unclear.

02:40.176 --> 02:43.178
In exchange for
this reduced sentence,

02:43.262 --> 02:46.098
what do you expect
from me?

02:48.685 --> 02:50.802
I believe that
David Robert Jones

02:50.853 --> 02:53.321
has a mole
in the Department of Defense.

02:53.389 --> 02:56.191
Among other things,
someone tipped him off

02:56.275 --> 02:58.977
about the location
of a prisoner transport,

02:59.045 --> 03:01.646
which allowed his men
to ambush my team

03:01.698 --> 03:04.682
and kill my partner.

03:04.734 --> 03:08.737
So you're going to tell me
who tipped off Jones.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.360
This is your last chance.

03:15.411 --> 03:19.364
One-time only offer signed
by the Secretary of Defense.

03:28.874 --> 03:31.059
You're making a mistake.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.978
I will find him.

03:33.045 --> 03:36.398
And soon Jones and everyone
who worked for him

03:36.482 --> 03:39.901
will find themselves rotting
in a cell just like you.

03:39.986 --> 03:43.655
Well, you needn't worry
about me, Agent Dunham.

03:43.722 --> 03:47.409
You see, I'm not
gonna be here very long.

03:47.493 --> 03:50.895
It's your world you ought
to be concerned about.

03:50.947 --> 03:54.833
Because as bad as you think
things are now,

03:54.900 --> 03:58.736
things are going to get
much worse.

04:05.845 --> 04:07.379
Can anyone here tell me

04:07.430 --> 04:09.881
what we are in
the business of doing?

04:09.932 --> 04:13.935
<i>We are in the business</i>
<i>of making money.</i>

04:15.754 --> 04:19.391
Do you agree,
Mr. Delman?

04:19.442 --> 04:20.858
Yes, Mr. Bauer.

04:20.926 --> 04:22.527
Can you explain to me
why Hamilton and I

04:22.595 --> 04:25.113
had to cancel our flight
to Baltimore this morning?

04:28.100 --> 04:30.035
<i>Um, well,</i>

04:30.102 --> 04:31.936
uh, because--

04:31.988 --> 04:34.039
Because you
and your associates

04:34.106 --> 04:35.940
failed to finish
the presentation.

04:37.493 --> 04:39.110
Yes, Mr. Bauer.

04:39.162 --> 04:40.629
<i>So you're telling me</i>
<i>that this company</i>

04:40.713 --> 04:42.447
has to forfeit
on one of its largest accounts

04:42.498 --> 04:45.617
because you didn't
do your job?

04:47.837 --> 04:49.638
Is that right?

04:49.722 --> 04:51.389
Yes, sir.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.059
Well, then it should come
as no surprise

04:54.126 --> 04:57.062
to anyone in this room,
especially you,

04:57.129 --> 05:01.316
Mr. Delman, you are--

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>is happening?</i>

05:02.468 --> 05:03.968

a daredevil.

05:47.628 --> 05:50.296
For the 11th time, Walter,
I drive the speed limit.

05:50.364 --> 05:52.132
Most automobile fatalities

05:52.199 --> 05:54.167

05:54.218 --> 05:55.635
Yeah, so does most driving.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.310
You didn't answer.

06:04.378 --> 06:05.979
That's 'cause I was out.

06:06.046 --> 06:08.348

Uh, you wanna let us know
what we're in for?

06:12.386 --> 06:14.904
Yeah, about an hour ago
two men were killed

06:14.989 --> 06:17.157
in this building
simultaneously.

06:17.224 --> 06:19.559
Witnesses say that
they were both lifted

06:19.610 --> 06:21.327
several feet in the air
and then driven back down

06:21.395 --> 06:22.746
to the ground
by some unseen force.

06:22.830 --> 06:23.997
They died on impact.

06:27.785 --> 06:30.670
Bones in the lower half of his
body are completely shattered.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.589
- Feel this.
- Oh, please, can I?

06:32.673 --> 06:35.842
He's dead, Peter.
You can't hurt him.

06:35.909 --> 06:37.677
Not really what
I was concerned about.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.212
I'm seeing similar
injuries over here.

06:39.263 --> 06:40.930
<i>How come out of this</i>
<i>entire building,</i>

06:41.015 --> 06:42.415
<i>it only happened</i>
<i>to these two?</i>

06:42.466 --> 06:45.685
The wrath of God
is revealed from heaven

06:45.753 --> 06:48.421
against all unrighteous men.

06:48.472 --> 06:49.773
Romans 1:18.

06:49.857 --> 06:51.858
That's the theory?

06:51.925 --> 06:54.027
The hand of God reached down
from the skies

06:54.094 --> 06:56.196
and punished these people
for their sins?

06:56.263 --> 06:58.865
One could argue that God
kills us all.

06:58.932 --> 07:03.620
Although typically not
in such a direct manner.

07:03.704 --> 07:05.705
Spinal column's crushed.

07:05.773 --> 07:10.877
Hip bone pushed up
through his torso.

07:10.944 --> 07:13.079
All injuries consistent
with impact.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.714
Yeah, sure,
but from that height

07:14.782 --> 07:16.549
the fall couldn't possible
have produced a velocity

07:16.617 --> 07:18.752
to do that.

07:18.803 --> 07:20.453
No, you're right.

07:20.504 --> 07:24.424
His injuries would require
much more velocity.

07:24.475 --> 07:26.059
So tell me
exactly what happened.

07:26.126 --> 07:27.560
He was, um, yelling,

07:27.628 --> 07:30.764
and I thought for sure
he was gonna fire me.

07:30.815 --> 07:33.483
He's yelled at us before,
but not like this.

07:33.567 --> 07:35.134
I've never seen him
so angry.

07:35.186 --> 07:36.319
And then all of a sudden,

07:36.403 --> 07:39.239
he was pulled up
out of his chair

07:39.306 --> 07:42.442
by, like, this invisible hand
or something.

07:44.745 --> 07:45.862
Excuse me.

07:48.699 --> 07:51.117
What you got?

07:51.168 --> 07:53.953
It's a laceration
of some sort.

07:54.004 --> 07:56.989
Could you check
the other victim's abdomen

07:57.041 --> 07:58.291
<i>for abrasions, dear?</i>

07:58.342 --> 08:00.627
Yeah, I got one here too.

08:00.678 --> 08:03.429
It's just above the waist.

08:03.497 --> 08:04.798
<i>What do you think</i>

08:04.849 --> 08:06.299
could have caused that?

08:06.350 --> 08:08.902
I'm not sure yet.

08:11.071 --> 08:12.355
A seatbelt.

08:15.008 --> 08:16.810
Look at the way
the laceration

08:16.861 --> 08:19.011
extends across the waist.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.814
<i>If these people</i>
<i>weren't in an office building,</i>

08:20.865 --> 08:22.148
<i>you'd swear they were</i>
<i>in a car crash together.</i>

08:22.199 --> 08:24.784
<i>We have a third victim.</i>

08:24.852 --> 08:25.952
Broyles just called,

08:26.019 --> 08:27.403
and apparently
they found a man

08:27.488 --> 08:29.455
who died in his apartment
in Brooklyn.

08:29.523 --> 08:31.190
His injuries
and time of death

08:31.242 --> 08:32.625
are consistent
with the men here,

08:32.693 --> 08:33.626
and he was a pilot.

08:33.693 --> 08:37.029
Yes, yes.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.298
Yes.

08:38.365 --> 08:40.299
The crushed spinal column,

08:40.366 --> 08:42.302
the broken femurs.

08:42.369 --> 08:44.671
These men's wounds are
consistent with a plane crash.

08:44.722 --> 08:45.722
That's brilliant, dear.

08:45.806 --> 08:47.006
Walter, how could these people

08:47.057 --> 08:48.207
have been in a plane crash

08:48.259 --> 08:49.559
if neither of them
was in a plane?

08:51.712 --> 08:53.546
Right.

08:53.597 --> 08:55.815
There is that.

09:04.608 --> 09:07.160
I might have an idea.

09:11.782 --> 09:13.416
Sir, the other side
was correct.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.500
<i>There was a plane crash.</i>

09:14.568 --> 09:15.869
When did it happen?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.737
Approximately 90 minutes ago
just after takeoff

09:17.788 --> 09:18.922
from an airfield
in Teaneck.

09:19.006 --> 09:19.923
Casualties?

09:20.007 --> 09:21.908
Two men and the pilot.

09:21.959 --> 09:25.261
Just the person
I wanted to see.

09:25.346 --> 09:26.763
Coordinate with NTSB
to take possession

09:26.847 --> 09:27.881
of the wreckage
and the bodies.

09:27.932 --> 09:30.850
Yes, sir.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.769
I've narrowed it down
to 108 names.

09:32.853 --> 09:34.587
108 names?

09:34.638 --> 09:36.088
Everyone who had
operational clearance

09:36.140 --> 09:37.757
and would have known
about the prisoner transport.

09:37.808 --> 09:41.361
<i>I want to initiate</i>
<i>background checks</i>

09:41.428 --> 09:43.563
<i>and electronic surveillance.</i>

09:43.614 --> 09:46.432
You're talking about
investigating our own people,

09:46.483 --> 09:50.036
many of whom work for D.O.D.
and outrank both of us.

09:50.103 --> 09:52.538
Sir, Jones has been a step
ahead of us the whole way.

09:52.606 --> 09:53.940
He knew we were coming,

09:53.991 --> 09:56.125
and he moved his entire
shapeshifter operation.

09:56.210 --> 09:57.377
When we were tracking him,

09:57.444 --> 09:58.945
he knew what frequency
we were on.

09:58.996 --> 10:00.446
Someone inside
tipped of Nina Sharp

10:00.497 --> 10:01.948
and got Lincoln killed.

10:01.999 --> 10:03.800
I understand.

10:03.884 --> 10:06.719
But this level of surveillance
comes with a lot of red tape.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.509
I'll cut through it.

10:16.563 --> 10:19.482
In the meantime,
I need you on something else.

10:19.566 --> 10:21.901
A charter plane crashed
in New Jersey this morning,

10:21.969 --> 10:23.469
killing everyone on board.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.971
Apparently it also killed

10:25.022 --> 10:26.322
their counterparts
on the other side.

10:26.407 --> 10:27.323
How's that possible?

10:27.408 --> 10:28.741
I don't know.

10:28.809 --> 10:30.410
But I want you
to report to the bridge

10:30.477 --> 10:31.911
and pick up members
from the other Fringe Division.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.696
We'll be investigating
this together.

10:35.332 --> 10:36.649
Yes, sir.

10:47.661 --> 10:48.594
Agent Dunham,
are you ready?

10:48.662 --> 10:50.930
Uh, almost.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.469
Always like to empty my bladder
before a long trip.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.971
Walter, you do realize
that we're just walking

10:58.022 --> 10:59.188
through a door.

10:59.273 --> 11:01.441
It's better safe
than sorry.

11:01.508 --> 11:03.509
We're ready, Sergeant.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.278
Dr. Walter Bishop?

11:05.345 --> 11:07.780
Yes, that's me.
Walter Bishop, consultant.

11:07.848 --> 11:10.199
Place your hand
on the screen, please.

11:10.284 --> 11:11.701
Do you have a pacemaker?

11:11.769 --> 11:13.286
No.

11:13.353 --> 11:14.537
Have you ever been diagnosed
with smallpox?

11:14.562 --> 11:15.571
No.

11:15.572 --> 11:16.823
- Tuberculosis?
- No.

11:16.874 --> 11:17.857
- Malaria?
- No.

11:17.908 --> 11:19.191
Are you on any medications?

11:19.243 --> 11:22.879
Several.
Mostly recreational.

11:22.963 --> 11:24.163
It's okay.

11:24.231 --> 11:25.798
Per treaty code 5891J,

11:25.866 --> 11:27.533
once you cross over,
you will be subject

11:27.584 --> 11:29.201
<i>to the same laws</i>
<i>and regulations</i>

11:29.253 --> 11:31.004
<i>as any naturalized citizen</i>
<i>of the other side.</i>

11:31.055 --> 11:32.371
<i>Do you understand?</i>

11:32.423 --> 11:34.757
I do.

11:38.095 --> 11:40.563
Initiating scan.

11:45.719 --> 11:47.937
Scan complete.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.366
Walter, are you sure that you
don't want me to go with you?

12:00.417 --> 12:01.834
I'm sure, dear.

12:01.902 --> 12:04.337
Once Peter receives
the bodies at the lab,

12:04.404 --> 12:06.572
he'll need your help
to examine them.

12:06.623 --> 12:08.341
And when I've
collected samples

12:08.408 --> 12:09.742
from the bodies
on the other side,

12:09.793 --> 12:12.845
I'll return and we can
compare the two.

12:12.913 --> 12:15.431
Besides, I'm sure
you love birds

12:15.516 --> 12:17.016
could use
a little time together.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.584
Walter.

12:18.635 --> 12:22.755
And thank you
for trusting me.

12:22.806 --> 12:26.442
This is a really
big step for me.

12:29.429 --> 12:31.114
Ah, my escort is here.

12:31.198 --> 12:33.566
<i>And by escort,</i>
<i>I don't mean prostitute.</i>

12:33.617 --> 12:35.201
Good to see you.

12:35.268 --> 12:36.602
You too.

12:37.771 --> 12:40.490
Shall we?

12:50.050 --> 12:51.283
How is she doing?

12:51.335 --> 12:53.152
<i>As well as</i>
<i>can be expected</i>

12:53.220 --> 12:54.887
considering she just
lost her partner.

12:54.955 --> 12:57.289
<i>She wants to find</i>
<i>the people responsible.</i>

12:57.341 --> 12:59.892
Yeah, I hope she does.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.312
She's lucky to have
your help, Lincoln.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.565
Take care of Walter.

13:05.632 --> 13:07.800
I will.

13:17.310 --> 13:18.644
Agent Dunham.
Sergeant.

13:20.697 --> 13:22.615
These two
are with me.

13:22.666 --> 13:23.683
What is this?

13:26.904 --> 13:28.621
It's a list
of hot spots

13:28.672 --> 13:30.823
<i>where the damage</i>
<i>was the worst.</i>

13:30.874 --> 13:34.127
I see.

13:34.178 --> 13:35.995
<i>It's getting better,</i>
<i>though.</i>

13:36.046 --> 13:38.014
<i>The bridge is helping</i>
<i>to heal our world.</i>

13:38.098 --> 13:39.665
You're all set.

13:39.716 --> 13:40.783
Thank you.

13:40.851 --> 13:42.435
Oh, Agent Dunham,

13:42.502 --> 13:44.637
sorry to hear
out Agent Lee.

13:44.688 --> 13:45.855
He was a good man.

13:45.939 --> 13:47.773
Thank you.

13:47.841 --> 13:49.675
I wanted to bring
a casserole.

13:49.726 --> 13:51.343
Casserole?

13:51.395 --> 13:54.313
Well, in times of grief,
people need to eat.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.781
But apparently
it's forbidden

13:55.849 --> 13:58.568
to transport perishables
between the universes.

14:00.353 --> 14:01.988
Dr. Bishop,
do you have a theory

14:02.039 --> 14:03.355
as to how a plane crash
in one universe

14:03.407 --> 14:04.490
can kill people
in the other?

14:04.541 --> 14:06.292
No, not yet.

14:06.359 --> 14:07.994
In all our years
of researching

14:08.045 --> 14:09.662
the relationship
between the universes,

14:09.713 --> 14:12.465
Belly and I were successfully
able to transport matter

14:12.532 --> 14:14.500
<i>from one side</i>
<i>to the other.</i>

14:14.551 --> 14:16.802
Even to merge tiny portions
of both universes,

14:16.870 --> 14:18.804
but it never occurred to us

14:18.872 --> 14:21.140
that an event that happened
in one universe

14:21.208 --> 14:22.308
would cause a reaction
on the other.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.060
But do you think
that someone

14:24.144 --> 14:25.344
could have caused this?

14:25.395 --> 14:27.647
On purpose?

14:27.714 --> 14:30.066
Anything's possible,
even Santa Claus.

14:30.150 --> 14:31.067
Why?

14:31.151 --> 14:32.318
You don't think Jones

14:32.385 --> 14:33.719
had something to do
with this, do you?

14:33.770 --> 14:34.887
It's just Nina Sharp
said that things

14:34.938 --> 14:36.388
were about
to get a lot worse,

14:36.440 --> 14:38.557
and then about an hour later,
this happened.

14:38.609 --> 14:40.326
<i>It's possible.</i>

14:40.393 --> 14:44.497
But if Jones caused this,

14:44.564 --> 14:48.067
he's conceived of something
Belly and I never did.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.352
What are you looking for?

15:06.419 --> 15:09.105
Not looking.
Listening.

15:10.474 --> 15:13.092
You hear that?

15:15.112 --> 15:17.730
It's a perfect "G".

15:29.660 --> 15:31.377
A hand.

15:31.444 --> 15:33.212
I removed it from
one of the victims

15:33.280 --> 15:34.797
on our side.

15:34.881 --> 15:36.448
You couldn't bring over
a casserole,

15:36.500 --> 15:37.717
but a severed hand
is okay?

15:37.784 --> 15:39.719
Shh.

15:40.804 --> 15:42.221
<i>That's a "G".</i>

15:42.289 --> 15:43.906
<i>That's incorrect.</i>
<i>It should be a "C".</i>

15:43.974 --> 15:47.093
You see,
each universe vibrates

15:47.144 --> 15:49.478
at its own
specific frequencies.

15:49.563 --> 15:51.597
Everything from this universe

15:51.648 --> 15:52.982
would vibrate at a "G",

15:53.066 --> 15:55.901
<i>and everything</i>
<i>from our universe at "C".</i>

15:55.969 --> 15:59.488
Somehow the victims
on our side

15:59.573 --> 16:01.240
were made to vibrate
at the frequency

16:01.308 --> 16:02.658
of this universe.

16:02.743 --> 16:04.410
So you're saying
that the doppelgangers

16:04.477 --> 16:06.912
were somehow linked
across universes?

16:06.980 --> 16:09.115
- Yes, it would seem so.
- <i>How?</i>

16:09.166 --> 16:11.100
How were the bodies retuned?

16:11.168 --> 16:13.002
That's a good question.

16:13.086 --> 16:14.754
Well, do you think maybe
that's what killed them?

16:14.821 --> 16:16.756
That's another good question,
but I don't think so.

16:16.823 --> 16:19.508
I suggest it was the plane
crash that killed them,

16:19.593 --> 16:21.510
not the retuning,
as you call it.

16:21.595 --> 16:24.430
But it stands to reason
that somehow

16:24.497 --> 16:27.366
the events were linked.

16:27.434 --> 16:29.769
Have you recovered
the black box yet?

16:29.836 --> 16:31.971
What's a black box?

16:32.022 --> 16:34.774
From the plane.
The cockpit recorder.

16:34.841 --> 16:37.693
We don't have that.

16:37.778 --> 16:40.429
But satellites record
all communication in flight.

16:40.497 --> 16:41.814
<i>Two-eight-niner,</i>

16:41.865 --> 16:43.366
<i>departure radar</i>
<i>has you at 8,000 feet.</i>

16:43.450 --> 16:45.017
<i>Maintain at heading 2-2-0.</i>

16:45.068 --> 16:46.685
<i>Idlewild control,</i>

16:46.737 --> 16:48.187
<i>we appear to be running</i>
<i>into some turbulence.</i>

16:48.238 --> 16:49.622
<i>Request permission</i>
<i>to climb another--</i>

16:49.689 --> 16:50.790
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

16:50.857 --> 16:52.208
<i>Say again,</i>
<i>two-eight-niner?</i>

16:52.292 --> 16:54.126
<i>ATC, aircraft</i>
<i>is coming apart.</i>

16:54.194 --> 16:55.795
<i>Systems failing!</i>
<i>Vertical control is--</i>

16:55.862 --> 16:57.529
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

16:57.581 --> 16:58.631
<i>The wing!</i>

17:01.084 --> 17:03.302
Would you like for me
to play that again?

17:03.370 --> 17:04.970
No.

17:05.038 --> 17:06.704
That won't be necessary.

17:06.757 --> 17:08.808
<i>If my hypothesis is correct,</i>

17:08.875 --> 17:12.144
whatever merged the frequencies
of the two universes

17:12.212 --> 17:14.480
destabilized
the aircraft.

17:14.547 --> 17:17.316
Whoever's responsible

17:17.384 --> 17:20.236
must have attached some sort
of device to the craft.

17:21.738 --> 17:22.821
Okay, well, what
if you're right?

17:22.888 --> 17:24.406
I mean, why?

17:24.491 --> 17:26.025
<i>Doesn't feel like</i>
<i>an assassination.</i>

17:26.076 --> 17:27.693
So what,
is it a threat?

17:27.743 --> 17:29.561
What are they
trying to prove?

17:31.498 --> 17:33.282
I haven't the slightest.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.576
Sorry that I'm late.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.846
No matter.

17:46.913 --> 17:49.799
Gave me time
to enjoy my tea.

17:52.519 --> 17:54.586
I must say,

17:54.638 --> 17:58.590
Matcha is one of the few things
I'm going to miss.

18:02.762 --> 18:03.863
How did our experiment

18:03.930 --> 18:05.731
<i>with the plane go?</i>

18:05.782 --> 18:07.433
Better than we expected.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.706
Do you have a preference
for this next one?

18:13.773 --> 18:16.041
Surprise me.

18:27.875 --> 18:28.744
Hey, you.

18:28.745 --> 18:29.711
Hey.

18:29.796 --> 18:32.464
How was the service?

18:33.032 --> 18:36.367
It was difficult.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.536
I'm so sorry.

18:38.587 --> 18:39.671
It's fine.

18:39.722 --> 18:41.539
- How's Chris?
- He's good.

18:41.790 --> 18:45.426
Can't stop talking
about some girl in his class.

18:45.511 --> 18:47.411
If only I could get him
to pay half as much attention

18:47.463 --> 18:50.581
to his homework
as he does to those girls.

18:50.633 --> 18:51.749
Where is he?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.518
He's in the living room.

18:53.585 --> 18:56.688
We've been entertaining
your friend.

18:56.755 --> 18:59.641
What friend?

19:03.762 --> 19:05.429
Oh, hey, Dad.

19:06.932 --> 19:08.783
Hello, Phillip.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.119
I'm just catching up
with Christopher here.

19:11.203 --> 19:13.604
He really is
a remarkable young man.

19:13.656 --> 19:16.774
It's a pleasure
to finally meet him.

19:22.047 --> 19:23.781
We have protocols
for making contact.

19:23.832 --> 19:27.719
Showing up in my home
isn't one of them.

19:27.786 --> 19:30.805
I see where
my showing up unannounced

19:30.889 --> 19:32.623
would be worrying.

19:32.675 --> 19:35.543
But I wanted
to bring this to you

19:35.611 --> 19:38.546
personally.

19:38.614 --> 19:41.966
I understand
it's a tad overdue.

19:44.136 --> 19:45.820
Christopher's responding
extraordinarily well

19:45.904 --> 19:48.239
to treatment.

19:48.307 --> 19:50.658
It's hard to imagine
that a few months ago

19:50.743 --> 19:53.811
he was in constant pain,

19:53.879 --> 19:56.981
his eyesight was gone,
that he was--

19:57.032 --> 19:58.482
Dying.

19:59.818 --> 20:01.753
Every parent's nightmare.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.255
<i>Christopher, come help me</i>
<i>in the kitchen!</i>

20:04.323 --> 20:09.160
I certainly don't envy
what you've been through.

20:13.832 --> 20:16.500
I noticed the way
your wife looks at him.

20:18.003 --> 20:21.439
It's as if she's
witnessing a miracle.

20:21.507 --> 20:23.674
But there aren't miracles.

20:23.726 --> 20:26.944
That's what you're here
to remind me, am I right?

20:31.233 --> 20:32.784
I'm sure you were dismayed

20:32.851 --> 20:35.703
after the unfortunate
incident with Agent Lee.

20:38.073 --> 20:40.625
I buried an agent today.

20:40.692 --> 20:42.460
A good man.

20:42.527 --> 20:44.629
And I'm also well aware
that Agent Lee

20:44.696 --> 20:48.532
isn't the first casualty
of our collaboration.

20:51.553 --> 20:55.039
Some day I'll have to account
for what I've done, but...

20:55.090 --> 20:57.541
But you can't
lose your boy.

21:00.846 --> 21:03.648
Love makes us vulnerable.

21:03.715 --> 21:08.386
But it also makes us human,
I suppose.

21:12.224 --> 21:14.742
Is there anything else?

21:16.612 --> 21:18.079
No.

21:18.163 --> 21:20.898
Not yet.

21:24.002 --> 21:28.906
But I will be calling on you
very shortly.

21:57.602 --> 21:59.103
Right here's fine.

22:07.612 --> 22:09.947
I'm going to Liberty Heights.

22:36.692 --> 22:38.810
What's that?

22:38.877 --> 22:40.745
Did you find everything
you were looking for?

22:40.812 --> 22:43.314
Mm-hmm.

22:43.365 --> 22:46.000
That'll be $18.47.

23:15.576 --> 23:17.094
Astrid, we're here.

23:17.266 --> 23:18.633
According to the cops,

23:18.684 --> 23:20.936
the cab went over the bridge
at exactly 6:37,

23:21.003 --> 23:23.855
the same time the victim
died on the other side.

23:31.514 --> 23:33.181
Hello.

23:33.232 --> 23:34.533
<i>My team's online.</i>

23:34.617 --> 23:36.785
<i>We're just standing by.</i>

23:36.852 --> 23:39.154
I'm ready whenever they are.

23:39.205 --> 23:41.990
It's nice to see you again.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.875
Yes.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.294
Um...

23:46.362 --> 23:49.030
I brought you something.

23:53.302 --> 23:54.386
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

23:54.470 --> 23:56.805
I got permission.

23:56.872 --> 23:59.207
You like it?

23:59.258 --> 24:03.144
I never thought that I was
going to taste this again.

24:03.212 --> 24:04.712
Oh, here they are.

24:04.764 --> 24:06.231
Hello.

24:06.315 --> 24:07.849
<i>Can you tell Agent Dunham</i>

24:07.900 --> 24:09.234
<i>that our victim's name</i>
<i>is Nancy Guerring.</i>

24:09.318 --> 24:11.319
According to her Show Me,

24:11.387 --> 24:13.488
she's from Malden,
Massachusetts.

24:13.556 --> 24:15.407
Hey, there you are.

24:15.491 --> 24:17.725
Domesticated badgers, really?
As pets?

24:17.777 --> 24:20.228
Come on, Walter.
We need you.

24:20.279 --> 24:23.748
<i>Olivia, their victim's name</i>
<i>is Nancy Guerring.</i>

24:23.833 --> 24:27.419
Same here.

24:27.503 --> 24:30.138
Nancy Elizabeth Guerring.

24:32.341 --> 24:35.427
Ask if her left arm
is broken.

24:35.511 --> 24:38.513
<i>Is her left arm broken?</i>

24:40.416 --> 24:42.017
Yep.

24:42.084 --> 24:43.084
<i>Hey, Astrid,</i>

24:43.135 --> 24:44.219
can you ask Walter

24:44.270 --> 24:45.270
what it is
I'm looking for?

24:45.354 --> 24:47.856
What this device
might look like?

24:49.592 --> 24:53.445
Doctor Bishop says
that a device this powerful

24:53.529 --> 24:55.213
is probably rather large.

24:55.281 --> 24:57.198
Uh, Peter,

24:57.266 --> 25:00.535
<i>Walter says the device</i>
<i>could be rather large.</i>

25:00.603 --> 25:02.537
Or it might be small.

25:04.457 --> 25:06.708
<i>Actually, I don't think</i>
<i>he has any idea</i>

25:06.775 --> 25:08.877
<i>what it looks like.</i>

25:17.953 --> 25:19.220
I got something.

25:25.278 --> 25:26.895
Hold on.

25:26.962 --> 25:28.813
<i>We found something.</i>

25:39.825 --> 25:42.327
What is it?

25:48.534 --> 25:50.001
Amphilicite.

25:51.921 --> 25:53.488
Jones.

25:56.042 --> 25:57.792
Have we found a similar device
at the crash site?

25:57.843 --> 25:59.427
No, but considering
the wreckage,

25:59.495 --> 26:01.379
it could have been
destroyed.

26:01.464 --> 26:03.932
Dr. Bishop,
do you have any idea

26:03.999 --> 26:05.600
what Jones is trying to do?

26:07.670 --> 26:09.604
He's done it twice,

26:09.672 --> 26:12.140
originating once
in each universe.

26:12.191 --> 26:14.025
So why?

26:14.110 --> 26:16.111
He must have a reason.
<i>Of course he has a reason.</i>

26:16.178 --> 26:18.780
Problem is I don't know
what it is.

26:23.069 --> 26:24.369
I'm sorry.

26:26.522 --> 26:27.855
It's been a long day.

26:27.907 --> 26:29.791
Maybe after
a good night's sleep.

26:29.858 --> 26:31.626
I think you're right.

26:31.694 --> 26:33.861
Although the pillow
I was given last night

26:33.913 --> 26:35.863
left me with
a terrible crick.

26:35.915 --> 26:38.550
Apparently this universe

26:38.634 --> 26:40.368
hasn't discovered memory foam.

26:40.419 --> 26:43.388
You know, Walter, you can stay
at my place tonight if you like.

26:43.472 --> 26:44.789
I got a spare room.

26:44.857 --> 26:47.041
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

26:47.093 --> 26:49.043
And I shall refrain
from sleeping naked.

26:49.095 --> 26:52.564
Well, that is
good to know.

26:52.648 --> 26:54.315
Okay, I'm gonna
get my bag.

27:03.726 --> 27:05.893
Colonel Broyles.

27:08.781 --> 27:10.665
I wanted to apologize.

27:10.733 --> 27:11.833
For what?

27:11.900 --> 27:13.218
For snapping at you.

27:13.285 --> 27:15.420
It's not you
I'm angry with.

27:15.504 --> 27:18.456
None of what Jones is doing

27:18.541 --> 27:22.010
would be possible
without the right conditions.

27:22.077 --> 27:24.179
I created those conditions

27:24.246 --> 27:26.514
by crossing over
all those years ago.

27:26.582 --> 27:28.916
Had I not done that,

27:28.968 --> 27:31.919
we wouldn't be
in this situation now.

27:35.975 --> 27:37.925
Dr. Bishop.

27:39.862 --> 27:41.362
May I ask you something?

27:41.430 --> 27:43.982
Of course.

27:45.451 --> 27:48.453
If you had to do it
all over again,

27:48.537 --> 27:50.538
would you make
the same choice?

27:55.444 --> 27:59.214
If you'd asked me that question
a few months ago,

27:59.281 --> 28:01.616
the answer would have been no.

28:01.667 --> 28:05.220
But now that I have met
my adult son,

28:05.287 --> 28:07.422
got to know him,

28:07.490 --> 28:10.809
I don't know that I'd
do anything differently.

28:26.308 --> 28:27.742
Agent Dunham,
I ran the names,

28:27.810 --> 28:29.944
all their cell records,
electronic communication--

28:29.995 --> 28:31.579
I'm sorry, what?

28:31.647 --> 28:34.165
The list of 108 names that
you gave to Colonel Broyles.

28:34.250 --> 28:38.002
He got clearance and asked me
to look into them.

28:38.087 --> 28:39.821
Did you find anything?

28:39.872 --> 28:41.155
I ran the data twice.

28:41.207 --> 28:42.674
There is nothing
to implicate any of them.

28:42.758 --> 28:44.459
Nothing at all
out of the ordinary.

28:44.510 --> 28:46.928
Do you want me to run the
information for a third time?

28:46.995 --> 28:49.664
No, it's okay.
Thank you, though.

29:18.694 --> 29:20.461
You wanna tell me
what this is?

29:20.529 --> 29:22.714
No.

29:22.798 --> 29:26.217
All you need to know is what
you're to do with it.

29:26.302 --> 29:28.303
Take it to Liberty Island,

29:28.370 --> 29:30.638
to what I believe
you call the bridge,

29:30.706 --> 29:32.390
and affix it
to the control panel

29:32.474 --> 29:34.542
on the machine.

29:36.445 --> 29:39.230
You do realize that machine
is healing our worlds?

29:39.315 --> 29:42.483
I do.

29:42.551 --> 29:45.820
Need I remind you
who I am healing?

29:58.367 --> 30:00.835
No hurry.

30:00.903 --> 30:04.889
Anytime before sundown tomorrow
should be fine.

30:19.718 --> 30:22.553
So your mother tells me
you have some good news.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.255
I told her
not to say anything.

30:24.306 --> 30:26.974
She didn't.
That's all she said.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.726
I'm waiting to hear it
from you,

30:28.793 --> 30:30.394
so spill it.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.430
Okay.

30:32.481 --> 30:34.298
So today at recess

30:34.349 --> 30:35.900
a bunch of the guys
were playing hitball.

30:35.967 --> 30:37.735
And when they started
picking the teams,

30:37.802 --> 30:39.737
I got picked first.

30:39.804 --> 30:41.305
That's great.

30:41.356 --> 30:43.574
No, Dad,
you don't understand.

30:43.641 --> 30:46.077
I got picked first, me.

30:46.144 --> 30:47.411
So who won the game?

30:47.479 --> 30:48.579
We did.

30:48.646 --> 30:49.980
Now that's good news.

30:50.032 --> 30:51.782
It gets better.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.484
Really?

30:53.535 --> 30:56.921
Yeah, so Stacy,
this girl in my class,

30:56.988 --> 30:59.924
told Danny
that she likes me.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.259
Can you believe that?

31:02.327 --> 31:05.329
Dad, no one's
ever liked me.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.333
I'm glad you had
a good day.

31:17.442 --> 31:18.526
Good night, Chris.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.728
Good night, Dad.

31:45.303 --> 31:46.337
Can't you sleep?

31:46.388 --> 31:47.871
Is the bed too hard?

31:47.923 --> 31:50.541
No, I was sleeping
like a baby.

31:50.592 --> 31:52.042
Sadly my bladder was not.

32:00.218 --> 32:02.319
You're a lot like her,
you know?

32:02.387 --> 32:04.855
<i>The other Olivia.</i>

32:04.906 --> 32:08.526
She has trouble sleeping too
when there's an open case.

32:08.577 --> 32:10.727
It's not the case.

32:15.066 --> 32:17.785
It's the evidence
from Lincoln's murder.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.592
I see.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.128
Are you looking
for something in particular?

32:28.797 --> 32:30.097
A mole.

32:31.767 --> 32:33.050
The night that he died,

32:33.101 --> 32:35.019
we were transporting
a prisoner,

32:35.086 --> 32:38.255
and someone must have let
Jones's men know

32:38.306 --> 32:39.923
<i>the location</i>
<i>of our convoy.</i>

32:39.975 --> 32:43.894
<i>And then he sent</i>
<i>his people into ambush us.</i>

32:43.945 --> 32:46.697
I'm sorry,
I don't usually drink,

32:46.764 --> 32:48.365
and my ex, Frank,
he left this here

32:48.433 --> 32:50.767
<i>when he moved out.</i>

32:53.705 --> 32:56.773
Are these the rest
of Frank's belongings?

32:56.825 --> 32:58.826
No.

33:01.129 --> 33:03.914
That's everything
that Lincoln had left

33:03.965 --> 33:05.716
in Fringe Division.

33:08.837 --> 33:12.956
And I'm supposed
to give it to his parents,

33:13.008 --> 33:14.892
and I just can't face them,

33:14.959 --> 33:17.294
not until I got
something more to tell them.

33:17.345 --> 33:18.795
And I thought this
would give me some courage,

33:18.847 --> 33:20.631
but all it's done
is just make me feel

33:20.682 --> 33:22.132
a little bit sick.

33:24.135 --> 33:27.238
I have just
the thing for that.

33:27.305 --> 33:30.074
Some people swear
by hair of the dog,

33:30.141 --> 33:34.311
but I prefer nature's sponge,
the egg.

33:34.362 --> 33:36.664
It won't be long.

33:36.748 --> 33:40.584
I'm missing something.
I know I am, Walter.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.754
Then I suggest
you sleep on it.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.656
Our brains
are remarkable instruments.

33:45.707 --> 33:49.593
They can process evidence
even when we're not conscious.

33:49.661 --> 33:52.680
Yeah, but that's the thing,
there is no evidence.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.849
I mean, there is
absolutely nothing

33:54.933 --> 33:57.017
linking any
of the likely suspects

33:57.102 --> 33:58.769
to the crime.

33:58.836 --> 34:00.837
Then perhaps it's time
to give some thought

34:00.889 --> 34:03.774
to the dog
that did not bark.

34:03.841 --> 34:05.142
I don't understand.

34:05.193 --> 34:08.512
Sherlock Holmes.

34:08.563 --> 34:10.514
Fictitious Detective.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.951
Penchant for cocaine?

34:14.018 --> 34:16.687
No, not on this side.

34:19.741 --> 34:23.543
The point is no evidence

34:23.628 --> 34:25.579
is evidence in and of itself.

34:27.532 --> 34:28.998
Okay.

34:29.050 --> 34:32.636
So what if our mole
is covering his tracks?

34:32.704 --> 34:34.170
Then it would have to be
someone pretty high up

34:34.222 --> 34:35.889
on the food chain.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.808
I mean, someone
with enough clearance

34:37.875 --> 34:39.476
to alter classified
details.

34:39.543 --> 34:40.543
How 'bout Colonel Broyles?

34:40.594 --> 34:41.878
No.

34:41.929 --> 34:43.480
Broyles?
No way.

34:43.547 --> 34:45.482
You know him
better than I do.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.717
But in the case of a mole,

34:47.768 --> 34:50.404
no one should be
above suspicion.

34:50.487 --> 34:53.489
Frankly, I'm still
upset about Nixon.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.502
I don't suppose you brought me
my breakfast.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.412
Is there a reason for
the additional privacy?

35:15.463 --> 35:17.431
I just wanted
to tell you in person

35:17.515 --> 35:19.249
that we found our mole.

35:21.970 --> 35:24.855
We have Colonel Broyles
in custody.

35:24.922 --> 35:27.574
He told us everything,

35:27.642 --> 35:31.195
<i>so he won't be able</i>
<i>to set you free anymore.</i>

35:37.485 --> 35:39.936
You really have no idea.

35:39.988 --> 35:41.705
Phillip is irrelevant.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.708
He's just another pawn.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.913
This changes nothing,
Agent Dunham.

35:49.965 --> 35:52.216
I know Jones,

35:52.283 --> 35:54.951
and he will come for me.

35:59.140 --> 36:01.575
Perhaps.

36:01.643 --> 36:04.011
Unless you're just
another pawn.

36:16.358 --> 36:18.492
She just confirmed
it's Broyles.

36:18.576 --> 36:20.077
For all we know,
Nina Sharp is lying.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.479
Why would she lie to me?
What does she have to gain?

36:22.530 --> 36:24.999
Maybe she knew
you were bluffing.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.650
Agents, I've been
asking around.

36:26.701 --> 36:29.119
No one has seen
Colonel Broyles come in today.

36:29.170 --> 36:30.838
<i>I checked,</i>
<i>and his subcutaneous tracker</i>

36:30.922 --> 36:33.156
was disabled
two hours ago.

36:33.208 --> 36:35.092
<i>Should we be worried?</i>

37:12.438 --> 37:13.789
Good morning, sir.

37:13.874 --> 37:17.793
Your Show Me, please.

37:17.878 --> 37:20.040
Thank you.

37:25.836 --> 37:27.136
<i>How you doing today?</i>

37:27.220 --> 37:29.454
Fine, thanks.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.979
Sir...

37:37.063 --> 37:39.515
You are good to go.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.075
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>thank you, Diane.</i>

37:50.143 --> 37:51.410
I'm really sorry to have
bothered you at home.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.145
Bye.

37:53.196 --> 37:55.247
Colonel Broyles's Show Me was
just swiped at Liberty Island.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.116
- What's he doing there?
- The bridge is there.

37:57.167 --> 37:58.450
<i>The Secretary of Defense.</i>

37:58.501 --> 38:00.920
He could be doing
any number of things.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.487
Come on.

38:17.270 --> 38:19.338
Agent Dunham.

38:19.389 --> 38:21.006
Did Colonel Broyles
come through here?

38:21.057 --> 38:22.524
Yeah, about ten minutes ago.

38:22.609 --> 38:24.343
<i>Hey, you haven't</i>
<i>been cleared!</i>

38:40.460 --> 38:41.543
Come on.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.061
I got your message.

39:14.494 --> 39:17.562
Colonel Broyles
just turned himself in.

39:17.614 --> 39:21.066
<i>He told us everything.</i>

39:21.117 --> 39:24.620
I'm sorry.

39:33.930 --> 39:37.582
Well, dear,
I guess this is it.

39:45.475 --> 39:48.944
Thank you
for everything.

39:49.029 --> 39:50.696
Don't judge him.

39:50.763 --> 39:55.767
No one can be certain
exactly what they're capable of,

39:55.819 --> 39:59.438
how far they'll go
to save the ones they love.

39:59.489 --> 40:01.940
I know this more than most.

40:06.279 --> 40:10.215
Keep an eye on this universe,
will you?

40:10.283 --> 40:12.334
I've grown quite fond of it.

40:21.678 --> 40:23.662
See, I'm surprised that you're
not going back with him.

40:23.730 --> 40:26.065
I told you I'd help
find the people

40:26.132 --> 40:29.485
who killed your partner.
And mine.

40:29.569 --> 40:31.236
And until we do that,

40:31.304 --> 40:34.306
I'm not going anywhere.

40:34.357 --> 40:37.159
Look, it might not
feel like it now,

40:37.243 --> 40:40.479
but it does get better.

41:37.887 --> 41:39.471
Walter, what's up?

41:39.539 --> 41:40.973
We got here
as quick as we could.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.307
I know why he did it twice.

41:42.375 --> 41:43.725
Jones, I think I know
what he's doing.

41:43.810 --> 41:45.210
- Okay.
- It was a test.

41:45.261 --> 41:47.479
The damage we saw
was irrelevant.

41:47.547 --> 41:48.564
He was just
taking readings.

41:48.648 --> 41:49.898
Well, what kind
of readings?

41:49.983 --> 41:52.217
He wanted to find
a common denominator,

41:52.268 --> 41:55.320
a frequency that could
link both universes.

41:55.388 --> 41:56.572
<i>Right, so that whatever</i>
<i>he did over there,</i>

41:56.656 --> 41:57.906
the same thing
would happen over here.

41:57.991 --> 41:59.391
We already know that, Walter.

41:59.442 --> 42:00.576
No.

42:00.660 --> 42:03.162
That was just a start.

42:03.229 --> 42:06.898
Had Colonel Broyles uploaded
this device into the machine,

42:06.950 --> 42:08.233
it would make it possible

42:08.284 --> 42:10.569
for Jones to do something
much worse.

42:10.620 --> 42:12.838
Like what?

42:12.905 --> 42:17.409
He could collapse
both universes.
