Officer:
What the hell did you do?
You shot a kid!

00:03.637 --> 00:05.571
        I need to call my uncle.
        He's gonna fix it.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.373
            There's someone you
            need to talk to.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.607
  Who? About what?

00:08.642 --> 00:10.442
Look at the pictures
on these records.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.710
  <i> These are our missing girls.</i>

00:11.746 --> 00:13.812
  I mean, what kind of monster
  needs to keep all this pain

00:13.848 --> 00:15.481
     cataloged in one place?

00:15.549 --> 00:16.715
   This is what it's for, right?

00:16.751 --> 00:18.584
              Your collection
              of women's misery?

00:18.619 --> 00:21.687
Tandy, I was in your head.
You know you're worth nothing.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.622
    <i> You know you have no one.</i>

00:25.459 --> 00:26.725

       (playing continues)

02:04.391 --> 02:06.458
Brigid:
I'm gonna take
a look inside.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.626
                     Officer:
                     Yes, ma'am.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.794
No one else until
I give the okay.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.395
                     Yes, ma'am.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.746
             (thud)

02:33.587 --> 02:34.786
               You said it was
               probably nothing.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.624
       This doesn't
       look like nothing.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.492
There were four big men
who were beaten.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.694
There, there, and there.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.496
You told me she
was stashed away

02:44.532 --> 02:46.398
where she couldn't
cause any more damage.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.833
 The other me.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.468
                   She is.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.769
Well, two of the four men
could still talk,

02:50.804 --> 02:53.639
and they spoke of a tiny woman
who kicked their asses
thoroughly.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.575
               A tiny woman did
               kick their asses.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.610
Hey, you-- you really
should be wearing gloves.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.681
               You see this cut?

03:02.716 --> 03:05.617
Yeah, shit. Tandy.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.521
                Looks like it.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.326
This seems like news to you.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.762
I thought you two
were a package deal.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.565
         (phone ringing)

03:19.600 --> 03:21.733
          Sometimes packages get
          damaged along the way.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.770
            (gasping)

03:27.641 --> 03:29.441
    Andre:
    Don't get up too quickly,

03:29.476 --> 03:31.777
   unless you want that fire
   in your head to burn all day.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.612
 What the hell did you do to me?

03:33.647 --> 03:36.715
   All I did was ask you to look
   at the pieces of your life.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.717
     You were driving,
     I just gave you a few maps.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.586
  Maps? Screw you!

03:40.621 --> 03:43.689
Those were full-on,
high-speed train wrecks!

03:43.724 --> 03:45.424
 And none of them
 were my life!

03:45.459 --> 03:47.459
         But you lived every one
         of them, didn't you?

03:47.494 --> 03:50.829
    Still got all the smells and
    tastes and feels, don't you?

03:50.864 --> 03:53.632
      All working themselves out
      in your head as we speak.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.468
       That confusion is part of
       why your head hurts.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.736
          Brigid:
          <i> Where did you</i>
          <i> see her last?</i>

03:57.771 --> 03:59.805
              She was running
              a con on this

03:59.840 --> 04:01.506
              woman who runs
              her abuse group.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.674
    What kind of con?

04:05.512 --> 04:06.745
                She was trying
                to get at her...

04:11.685 --> 04:13.785
           scumbag ex-boyfriend.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.387
Why didn't she take
you with her?

04:19.793 --> 04:22.394
  Probably because I told her
  I'd be better off without her.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.735
Hey, Tandy's tough.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.503
She'll show up. Watch.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.671
    She'll be--

04:35.442 --> 04:36.842
    Fine.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.812
   -Where's Tyrone?
   -It's possible that your
   heart is confused as well.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.481
           That friend of yours?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.383
             He's gone from your
             life now, remember?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.486
        -I shot him dead.
        -No.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.555
     No, you're-- you're just
     messing with me.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.726
  Just like you did
  with Mikayla, right?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.395
'Cause that's what
you do, right?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.597
You get inside people's minds,
and you-- you cause them pain?

04:58.632 --> 05:01.400
    I don't cause anyone's pain.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.734
                I understand it,

05:02.770 --> 05:04.503
                   feel for it,

05:04.538 --> 05:06.438
       commiserate it with mine.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.473
         It's the only way to
         tamp down my migraines.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.376
So, what, this is all
so you can blow your horn?

05:12.446 --> 05:14.313
       This is so I can survive.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.683
            The world saddled me
            with so much pain,

05:17.718 --> 05:20.419
  the only way I can keep on is
  to share it from time to time.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.687
  That's sick.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.789
    That's America, Tandy Bowen.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.692
Well, I have another
word for it.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.460
    It's--

05:29.797 --> 05:31.697
               You can't pull
               that trick on me.

05:31.732 --> 05:35.334
                 Or anyone else.
                 Not anymore.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.535
         You need hope for that.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.537
           (knocking)

05:38.572 --> 05:39.771
                And there's none
                of that here.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.576
        -She good to go?
        -Let's find out.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.311
    (groaning)

06:26.420 --> 06:28.453
    -May I use the restroom?
    -Not right now.

06:29.623 --> 06:33.525
Okay, then, what right now?

06:35.662 --> 06:37.763
        -What are you
        gonna do with me?
        -I sometimes cook

06:37.798 --> 06:39.798
         when I'm working things
         out in my head.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.501
             The night after
             Billy went missing,

06:42.536 --> 06:45.404
        I remember I dug through
        our junk drawer

06:45.439 --> 06:47.572
         and pulled out
         an old crabcake recipe.

06:49.610 --> 06:53.678
       I remember reading
       in the particulars
       it serves four.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.580
                I remember being
                fine with that.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.682
            Like it wasn't real.
            You follow me?

07:01.622 --> 07:04.322
I'm not sure
I'm the best person
to answer that question.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.658
   No, I suppose not, but you're
   the only one I can talk to

07:06.693 --> 07:08.493
           about my dilemma.

07:11.498 --> 07:13.465
        So I'm in a little bit
        of a bind here.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.703
    Stuck between two forces.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.405
  Good and evil?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.541
       -(knife sharpening)
       -Billy and Tyrone.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.611
 I know that you're the best way
 to make sure that Tyrone

07:26.647 --> 07:28.613
         never has to look over
         his shoulder again.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.349
That's all I want as well.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.385
      (chopping vegetables)

07:33.420 --> 07:34.453
     Justice.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.555
        You understand the irony
        in that statement?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.694
     Given that you murdered
     my firstborn in cold blood?

07:44.398 --> 07:45.464
    Yes, ma'am.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.699
              He was one of
              your other wrongs.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.668
    He was.

07:49.703 --> 07:53.405
   I'm gonna hold on to these
   two thoughts in my head, hmm?

07:55.476 --> 07:57.542
          And to reconcile them,
          I'm gonna cook,

07:57.578 --> 07:59.511
           and we're gonna talk.

07:59.546 --> 08:00.645
                And we'll see.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.283
              We'll see if your
              value to Tyrone

08:05.319 --> 08:07.385
         outweighs the need
         for me to end your life

08:07.421 --> 08:09.421
      for what you did to Billy.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.461
Lia:
Tandy, meet Del.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.662
She's gonna
show you around.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.431
  It's nice to meet you.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.334
Lia:
All the girls rise around 10,

08:22.369 --> 08:23.768
and then they shine
while we wait for night.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.304
Laundry, linens, windows.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.672
You and Del are
on Andre's room.

08:27.708 --> 08:31.343
Del, I think the floor
could use a good mopping.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.777
             We clean his room?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.613
                  For what?

08:34.648 --> 08:36.648
          For the honor of being
          sold into slavery?

08:36.683 --> 08:39.317
All we have to
do is work,

08:39.352 --> 08:40.619
and they give us
everything we need.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.721
      You have no idea
      what you need.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.523
                 Lia:
                 Sure, she does.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.591
     You are holding these girls
     against their will.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.466
                    Go on, Del.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.700
                 You can leave
                 if you want to.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.669
         Just walk out the door.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.406
 Of course not.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.647
   My friends are gonna find me.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.448
            Lia:
            What friends, Tandy?

09:10.484 --> 09:12.350
          I've been watching you
          for weeks now.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.620
         Sitting in that circle,
         brooding and boiling.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.623
          All that untapped
          rage and energy

         Don't act like I don't.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.696

09:24.731 --> 09:26.431
              And they all
              start off thinking

09:26.466 --> 09:28.400
       there's someone out there
       that's gonna find them.

09:28.435 --> 09:31.636
       Then they all remember
       the friend they told off,

09:31.672 --> 09:34.306

I found a halfway house.

15:22.205 --> 15:23.905
                and they put you
                in this hell.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.239
This isn't hell.

15:25.275 --> 15:27.241
        It's not heaven,

     Well, I have no interest in
     getting used to this place.

15:45.795 --> 15:47.762
I got a call
from a resident.

15:47.797 --> 15:50.832
Said she saw a young man
in a hoodie skulking about.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.834
         A young man
         or a young black man?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.035
She used a different word.

15:54.070 --> 15:58.139
We gave them chase down
to the docks by Levee 202.

15:58.174 --> 16:01.142
And that damn rig exploded,
and I pulled the trigger.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.977
     -And...
     -(crab shells cracking)

16:03.013 --> 16:05.146
  that moment
  changed my life.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.081
        That's when you called
        your uncle, the senator.

16:08.151 --> 16:09.817
Yes, ma'am.

16:09.853 --> 16:11.786
           Did you know he was
           gonna cover it up?

16:12.922 --> 16:15.757
On some level,
I was hoping he would.

16:15.792 --> 16:18.226
       Did you know he was gonna
       frame my baby boy
       as a drug addict?

16:18.261 --> 16:20.995
  On that same level,
  I didn't care.

16:21.031 --> 16:22.764
Too concerned with myself.

16:22.799 --> 16:24.866
          So he made some calls.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.803
          Talk me through them
          one step at a time.

16:28.838 --> 16:31.939
They changed the firearms log,
found a body in Baton Rouge

16:31.975 --> 16:33.841
       that would pass
       after water damage,

16:33.877 --> 16:38.079
     and set my partner up
     to keep his mouth shut.

16:39.816 --> 16:41.182

            change of heart?

eight months alone.

16:50.827 --> 16:52.960
Nothing but my memories
