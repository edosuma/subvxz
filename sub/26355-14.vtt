00:44.043 --> 00:46.879
Hey, Peter. How about
that gay encounter we had?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.630
God, every time with this guy.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.300
I'm gonna take the stairs.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.144
Okay, it's all right.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.979
I do this every week
in the opening credits.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.106

Everything's wet.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.086
I'm just gonna stay here.

01:28.087 --> 01:30.631
Was Labyrinth a good movie?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.758
I can't remember.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.219
I don't want to watch it again,
though.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.471
Seems like a chore.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.808
Aw, even Slinky from Accounting
can make it up the stairs.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.185
Don't forget to turn in
your time card, Peter.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.978
What are you, allergic to money?

01:44.979 --> 01:47.105
Ha ha. No.
No, I want to get paid.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.232
Just forgot.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.234
Ugh, look at me.

01:50.235 --> 01:53.362
I haven't felt this out of shape
since I took surfing lessons.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.988
Boy, this is harder
than I thought.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.865
My arms are getting
really tired.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.034
Nah, you're fine.
Just keep goin'.

01:59.035 --> 02:02.037
Tai, your positivity
is infectious!

02:02.038 --> 02:04.164
All right, P-Town,
wave comin' in.

02:04.165 --> 02:07.627
I'm just gonna give you a little
push, and you just stand up.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.982
Okay, so, welcome
to the first meeting

02:29.983 --> 02:32.193
of our women's
creative writing workshop.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.822
Ladies.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.700
Okay, Donna,
you want to read yours?

02:39.701 --> 02:41.285
Oh, I didn't do mine.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.955
Wha...? Well, then you can't
have any more snacks.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.164
You just can't!

02:46.165 --> 02:47.958
Well, I guess it's my turn.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.460
"Louise lowered her velvet hood,

02:50.461 --> 02:53.130
"letting loose
her flowing red hair.

02:53.131 --> 02:56.258
"Ignoring her friends' obvious
and understandable envy,

02:56.259 --> 02:59.553
"she confidently approached
the mysterious castle.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.346
"The doors blew open,

03:01.347 --> 03:04.099
"as if some magical force
had been expecting her.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.059
"Louise belonged here,

03:06.060 --> 03:09.045
"if only because this is where
Horatio called home.

03:09.047 --> 03:12.007
"Then, through the vegetation,
and past the mist

03:12.008 --> 03:15.761
"that sprinkled
her heaving bosom, she saw him.

03:15.762 --> 03:20.098
"Horatio, with his long, flowing
hair blowing in the breeze,

03:20.099 --> 03:22.267
"his cape fluttering.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.894
"He had only two loves

03:23.895 --> 03:28.065
"in his life: his horses
and Louise's heaving bosom.

03:28.066 --> 03:31.109
"He grabbed her tighter than
she'd ever been held before.

03:31.110 --> 03:34.488
"A way in which her husband,
Paulter, had not held her

03:34.489 --> 03:36.573
"since before
they were married.

03:36.574 --> 03:38.742
"Horatio then took Louise
by the hand,

03:38.743 --> 03:42.287
"leading her out to his stables
as her bosom heaved.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.832
"Louise's mind was racing
in anticipation

03:44.833 --> 03:48.293
"of the dirty hay sex that was
gonna most definitely happen.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.671
"As the two lovers
entangled into one

03:50.672 --> 03:53.006
"atop the probably peed-on hay,

03:53.007 --> 03:54.800
"Louise's bosom heaved.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.969
"They spent the next 18 minutes

03:56.970 --> 04:00.597
"fighting off sneezes,
in the throes of ecstasy.

04:00.598 --> 04:02.432
Heaving bosom."

04:02.433 --> 04:05.727
- Damn, that's steamy, Lois.
- Really?

04:05.728 --> 04:08.063
Uh, yeah, really. Phew!

04:08.064 --> 04:10.065
Anybody mind if I open me?

04:10.066 --> 04:12.651
Ah!

04:12.652 --> 04:15.697
See you in the shower, ladies.

04:19.909 --> 04:21.159
What am I gonna do?

04:21.160 --> 04:23.412
I've been here all day,
and I can't move.

04:23.413 --> 04:27.876
I got it. I'll do what
James Franco did in 127 Hours.

04:29.043 --> 04:30.419
UCLA admissions office.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.838
Yes, I'd like to enroll
in a couple of classes,

04:32.839 --> 04:35.924
so I can have sex with girls
not old enough to get into bars.

04:35.925 --> 04:37.092
Peter!

04:37.093 --> 04:38.595
I heard you're in some trouble!

04:39.971 --> 04:42.347
I'm stuck!
I don't want to die here!

04:42.348 --> 04:44.975
I just want to go to
my desk and surf the Internet.

04:44.976 --> 04:47.729
Hang on, Peter.
I'll come up and save you.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.481
Stairs.

04:51.482 --> 04:53.984
Why'd it have to be stairs?

05:10.919 --> 05:14.379
I can't do it. Here, you're just
gonna have to kill me.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.632
Wait. Look, Joe.

05:16.633 --> 05:19.886
A lever to turn the stairs
into a slide.

05:22.263 --> 05:23.597
Damn it, Peter!

05:23.598 --> 05:25.724
It's just a little water.
What's it gonna hurt?

05:25.725 --> 05:26.892
Oh, God!

05:26.893 --> 05:29.269
Delete... history.

05:29.270 --> 05:30.813
No.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.692
No!

05:44.035 --> 05:47.037
Peter, you caused millions of
dollars' worth of water damage,

05:47.038 --> 05:50.290
all because you couldn't
make it up the stairs.

05:50.291 --> 05:53.293
Aw, man.
This means I'm the work fatty.

05:53.294 --> 05:55.253
I haven't been this embarrassed
since I forgot

05:55.254 --> 05:58.298

06:37.296 --> 06:40.924
A Stable Affair
by Lois Griffin.

06:40.925 --> 06:44.220
Okay, another writer
in the house.

06:47.932 --> 06:50.058
Oh, my God, this is amazing!

06:50.059 --> 06:51.768
This is basically a guide

06:51.769 --> 06:53.854
to what Lois is looking for
in a lover.

06:53.855 --> 06:55.439
Check this out.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.858
Lois is writing a romance novel
about a woman

06:57.859 --> 06:59.693
who is unhappy with her husband

06:59.694 --> 07:01.820
and begins
to have a torrid affair

07:01.821 --> 07:03.905
with a caped lover
who has horses.

07:03.906 --> 07:05.741
Don't you know what this is?

07:05.742 --> 07:08.702
It's a description
of her every fantasy and desire.

07:08.703 --> 07:10.829
This could finally
be my key to...

07:10.830 --> 07:12.706
To what, banging my mom?

07:12.707 --> 07:15.042
You know, you are the worst.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.045
Ladies.

07:21.966 --> 07:23.925
Ugh! You guys,
this is so embarrassing.

07:23.926 --> 07:25.260
All this happened

07:25.261 --> 07:28.055
because I'm too fat
to make it up some stairs.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.389
Peter, you got to lose weight.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.558
I know. You guys got
to help me, though.

07:31.559 --> 07:34.061
I can't do it on my own.
I'm too weak.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.479
All right,
we'll help you, Peter,

07:35.480 --> 07:36.938
but we're doing it
Quagsberry rules.

07:36.939 --> 07:38.273
What's that?

07:38.274 --> 07:40.025
A woman--
or in this case, a man--

07:40.026 --> 07:42.569
has to do anything I say,
no questions asked.

07:42.570 --> 07:44.529
Anything, I promise.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.281
My dearest Lois,

07:46.282 --> 07:47.908
I've taken Quagmire's place

07:47.909 --> 07:50.243
as a Union soldier
in the Civil War.

07:50.244 --> 07:53.789
Shortly after I arrived,
they amputated my leg.

07:53.790 --> 07:56.541
I dared them to,
and it was a big mistake.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.377
The other guy in my tent
is a wet dead guy.

07:59.378 --> 08:02.256
Yours, Peter.

08:08.262 --> 08:10.764
All right, Peter, today we start
helping you lose weight.

08:10.765 --> 08:12.057
First, let me just make sure

08:12.058 --> 08:14.351
you're not hiding any food
in your clothes.

08:15.770 --> 08:19.689
Taste. Taste. Taste the rainbow.

08:19.690 --> 08:21.859
Peter, are you hiding Skittles
in your pants?

08:23.903 --> 08:25.320
Is that all of 'em?

08:25.321 --> 08:27.323
Just-just give me a second.

08:30.493 --> 08:33.328
When I turned about 40,
it started breaking up into two.

08:33.328 --> 08:34.746
Weekend plans?

08:34.746 --> 08:37.125
Please don't talk to me.
I need to focus.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.842
Good morrow!

08:46.843 --> 08:50.178
What is thee, uh, up to?

08:50.179 --> 08:51.847
Brian, is that your horse?

08:51.848 --> 08:53.265
Wh-When did you get a horse?

08:53.266 --> 08:54.975
Oh, I've been an Equus
for a while.

08:54.976 --> 08:57.310
The play
with Harry Potter's penis?

08:57.311 --> 08:59.688
Just my trusty steed here.

08:59.689 --> 09:01.398
We have a special connection.

09:01.399 --> 09:03.567
Me being an equestrianist
and everything.

09:03.568 --> 09:05.902
I-I had no idea
you were into horses.

09:05.903 --> 09:07.237
Sexy, huh?

09:07.238 --> 09:09.573
No, seems like a hassle,
and expensive.

09:09.574 --> 09:11.366
How do you pay for it all?

09:11.367 --> 09:13.994
Well, the costs are meager
when you're able to dominate

09:13.995 --> 09:17.665
and control the beast with
just... the slightest glance.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.458
Stop it.

09:20.459 --> 09:21.877
Ha, ha! What?!

09:21.878 --> 09:23.461
This is nuts!

09:23.462 --> 09:26.089
Anyway, I've been speaking to
my horse in the silent language

09:26.090 --> 09:28.008
of knowing, and I...

09:28.009 --> 09:30.218
Never walk behind a horse.

09:30.219 --> 09:33.096
You would have to hate horses
not to know that.

09:33.097 --> 09:34.514
...being one with nature.

09:35.808 --> 09:37.309
A mutual bond of trust.

09:38.686 --> 09:40.896
Different species, same heart.

09:51.491 --> 09:54.994
You're dethspicable.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.998
Welcome to CrossFit, Peter.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.000
How's it different
from a regular gym?

10:02.001 --> 10:04.044
Do regular gyms have
open garage doors

10:04.045 --> 10:06.880
where members' large dogs
can charge innocent civilians?

10:06.881 --> 10:08.548
No, I... I guess not.

10:08.549 --> 10:10.926
Okay, to start,
why don't you go meet the owner,

10:10.927 --> 10:12.093
Jayce, over there?

10:12.094 --> 10:14.054
He'll help maximize
your nutrition regimen.

10:14.055 --> 10:15.639
Hi, I'm Peter.

10:15.640 --> 10:16.848
Hey, man. Jayce with a "Y."

10:16.849 --> 10:18.558
Yeah, I figured.

10:18.559 --> 10:20.393
So, to start out, like, uh,

10:20.394 --> 10:22.812
tell me, what's
your favorite kind of food?

10:22.813 --> 10:24.814
Pizza.

10:24.815 --> 10:26.358
- Oh, man.
- What?

10:26.359 --> 10:28.985
You, uh...

10:28.986 --> 10:30.528
y-you can't eat pizza.

10:30.529 --> 10:32.155
Why not?

10:32.156 --> 10:33.990
It's, uh-- it's...

10:33.991 --> 10:35.325
uh, it's...

10:35.326 --> 10:36.576
it's bad.

10:36.577 --> 10:38.578
Why?

10:38.579 --> 10:40.914
Because, uh, it's, like, uh...

10:40.915 --> 10:42.916
pretty bad for you.

10:42.917 --> 10:43.834
But what makes it bad?

10:43.835 --> 10:45.585
Oh.

10:45.586 --> 10:48.463
Yeah, no, it's, like, uh...

10:48.464 --> 10:50.924
like, probably one
of the worst things you can eat.

10:50.925 --> 10:53.051
How come?

10:53.052 --> 10:57.055
Uh, uh, because, of, like,
the ingredients in it.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.057
Which ones?

10:59.058 --> 11:01.226
Uh, I mean, yeah, like,

11:01.227 --> 11:03.061
basically, all of them.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.063
Name one.

11:05.064 --> 11:06.564
Yeah, I-- yeah, I mean...

11:06.565 --> 11:08.733
you said-- your-your words,

11:08.734 --> 11:09.901
uh...
pizza.

11:09.902 --> 11:11.403
All right,
I'm cutting this off right now.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.698
It's clear you're an idiot
and deserve no more of my time.

11:14.699 --> 11:17.409
Oh, Peter,
you're home from CrossFit.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.493
Here, have some pizza.

11:18.494 --> 11:20.078
Oh.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.247
Uh, you know what is in that?

11:22.248 --> 11:23.748
It's, like...

11:23.749 --> 11:25.292
- It's very bad.
- What?

11:26.294 --> 11:28.920
Uh, wow.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.922
Okay, Peter,
a good and conspicuous workout

11:30.923 --> 11:33.091
is to do lunges on the sidewalk.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.092
Just do like I do.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.593
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.096
- Step. Step.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.597
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.434
- Step. Step.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.893
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

11:43.894 --> 11:46.563
- Step. Step.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:46.564 --> 11:48.064
Step.

11:48.065 --> 11:49.607
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

11:49.608 --> 11:50.942
- Step.
- Uh-huh.

11:50.943 --> 11:54.195
- Step. Step.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:54.196 --> 11:56.740
Step. Step.

11:56.741 --> 11:58.116
Step.

11:58.117 --> 11:59.868
Step. Step.

11:59.869 --> 12:02.454
Okay, Peter, whatever you do,

12:02.455 --> 12:04.164
don't look down the hole.

12:06.417 --> 12:08.626
Oh, God!
I looked down the hole!

12:08.627 --> 12:11.129
Oh! I got a sense
of what's down there!

12:11.130 --> 12:13.340
Okay, okay. All right,
you can still save this.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.591
Just don't smell.

12:15.676 --> 12:17.635
Oh, God! I smelled everything!

12:17.636 --> 12:20.305
Oh, it's so deep in my nose!

12:20.306 --> 12:22.057
Okay, okay, whatever you do,

12:22.058 --> 12:24.434
do not dip your cupped hand
in the water.

12:24.435 --> 12:26.895
Oh, God! I'm doing it!

12:26.896 --> 12:28.855
Oh, God!
What is wrong with me?!

12:28.856 --> 12:31.483
The chemicals in the water
are not breaking down

12:31.484 --> 12:33.360
the integrity
of these movements!

12:33.361 --> 12:35.153
Okay, Peter,
you can quit pretending.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.030
- The workout's over.
- Thanks.

12:37.031 --> 12:38.698
I was just in there
checking my phone.

12:38.699 --> 12:39.991
My phone!

12:43.037 --> 12:44.037
Okay, Peter,

12:44.038 --> 12:45.372
whatever you do,

12:45.373 --> 12:48.459
do not open your eyes
underwater.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.962
What the hell?

12:52.963 --> 12:54.881
I thought we were gonna get
a ten-dollar scoop of ice cream

12:54.882 --> 12:56.549
with all the millennials
who can afford

12:56.550 --> 12:57.926
ten-dollar scoops of ice cream

12:57.927 --> 12:59.969
but can't afford to move out
of their parents' house.

12:59.970 --> 13:01.930
We are. But first
I need to pick up this wine

13:01.931 --> 13:03.807
that Lois mentioned
in her story.

13:03.808 --> 13:06.017
Where's that part
about the wine?

13:06.018 --> 13:09.187
"The doors magically opened."

13:09.188 --> 13:11.231
"Chill came over her."

13:11.232 --> 13:13.024
"Through the vegetation."

13:13.025 --> 13:15.944
"Light mist."

13:15.945 --> 13:18.530
Uh, Brian, everything you read
just happened to us.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.699
I think her book
is about the grocery store.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.786
Oh... my... God.

13:24.787 --> 13:25.871
What?

13:26.914 --> 13:29.125
♪ ♪

13:32.670 --> 13:34.921
It's the guy, Horatio,
from Lois's book.

13:34.922 --> 13:38.425
She's fantasizing about having
an affair with this guy.

13:38.426 --> 13:41.719
Or, who knows, maybe even
is having an affair with him.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.596
Excuse me,
where are the crackers?

13:43.597 --> 13:45.390
What? We don't work here.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.058
We're a dog and a baby.

13:47.059 --> 13:49.894
I-- do I-- do my, do my clothes
make it look like I work here?

13:49.895 --> 13:51.771
I think it's the overalls, yeah.

13:51.772 --> 13:53.231
Hey, get back to work.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.441
I'll see you back at home,
Brian.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.861
I've got to finish my shift.

14:05.995 --> 14:06.995
I don't get it.

14:06.996 --> 14:08.955
You've gained 12 pounds.

14:08.956 --> 14:11.124
Looks like we're gonna have
to take more drastic measures.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.501
Peter, say you're
not gonna have sex with me.

14:13.502 --> 14:14.794
- What?
- Just say it.

14:14.795 --> 14:16.129
I'm not gonna have sex with you.

14:18.299 --> 14:19.924
Guys, let me out of here!

14:19.925 --> 14:21.926
No! You said you would do
whatever's necessary

14:21.927 --> 14:23.344
to help you lose weight.

14:23.345 --> 14:24.846
Please, let me out!

14:24.847 --> 14:27.265
Glenn, is it okay
if I stay the night?

14:31.645 --> 14:34.314
Rancor, what are you doing here?

14:34.315 --> 14:35.982
I'm trying to diet, too.

14:35.983 --> 14:37.400
Eating too many pig guys?

14:37.401 --> 14:40.069
I thought it was the pig guys,
but, you know what,

14:40.070 --> 14:41.280
it was the bread.

14:47.912 --> 14:49.412
I'm so hungry!

14:49.413 --> 14:50.830
Let me out!

14:50.831 --> 14:52.665
I'll tell you what,
first guy that lets me out

14:52.666 --> 14:54.292
gets his own spin-off.

14:54.293 --> 14:55.460
Not you, Cleveland.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.253
Sorry, Peter,
this is for your own good!

14:57.254 --> 15:00.173
Yeah, you told us you would do
anything to lose weight!

15:00.174 --> 15:02.425
I lied!
I just want to be free,

15:02.426 --> 15:05.679
like a recently divorced man
with no kids!

15:08.974 --> 15:10.391
This is nice.

15:10.392 --> 15:12.811
This is better.

15:15.856 --> 15:17.398
Stewie, I can't believe it.

15:17.399 --> 15:19.567
I mean, do-do you think
Lois could be having an affair

15:19.568 --> 15:20.735
with this Horatio guy?

15:20.736 --> 15:22.362
Brian, will you watch Stewie?

15:22.363 --> 15:23.738
I have to go get groceries

15:23.739 --> 15:25.698
and won't be back
until later tonight.

15:25.699 --> 15:27.158
Uh, yeah, sure!

15:27.159 --> 15:28.826
Oh, my God, Stewie,
she's going to the store

15:28.827 --> 15:30.411
and won't be back until tonight?

15:30.412 --> 15:32.080
Do you know what that means?

15:32.081 --> 15:35.083
Disguises?

15:35.084 --> 15:37.752
No, but we should follow her and
see what the hell is going on.

15:37.753 --> 15:38.920
Stewie-chan!

15:43.384 --> 15:44.551
I'll meet you there, Brian.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.303
I've got to finish my shift.

15:53.936 --> 15:56.020
All right, Peter, now, I know
you haven't eaten in a while,

15:56.021 --> 15:59.065
so this is something called
the Pocket Diet.

15:59.066 --> 16:00.483
Okay, guys, empty your pockets.

16:00.484 --> 16:03.319
Whatever you got in there,
he eats.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.781
Uh, Glenn, can we go somewhere
and just talk for a minute?

16:09.076 --> 16:11.077
Guys, stop saying things,
all right?

16:11.078 --> 16:13.038
I will say the things!

16:22.923 --> 16:23.923
Oh, my God.

16:23.924 --> 16:25.092
He's getting in the car.

16:26.468 --> 16:27.719
He's going in for a hug.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.262
They're hugging!
This is insane!

16:29.263 --> 16:31.097
I know. This guy.

16:31.098 --> 16:34.226
This guy is a star.

16:38.397 --> 16:39.897
I can't believe it, Stewie.
She picked him up.

16:39.898 --> 16:40.898
They hugged.

16:40.899 --> 16:42.275
Lois is having an affair!

16:42.276 --> 16:44.444
We've got to stop them.

16:44.445 --> 16:47.447
Aw, great.

16:47.448 --> 16:50.491
Just great.

16:50.492 --> 16:52.995
♪ ♪

17:09.637 --> 17:11.929
Lois, don't do it!

17:11.930 --> 17:12.972
Brian?

17:12.973 --> 17:14.641
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:14.642 --> 17:15.933
Don't do what?

17:15.934 --> 17:17.185
Don't have sex with Horatio!

17:17.185 --> 17:18.394
It's not worth it!

17:18.395 --> 17:19.729
What are you talking about?

17:19.730 --> 17:21.897
Look, I found your book
and read it.

17:21.898 --> 17:23.483
I thought that you wrote

17:23.483 --> 17:24.983
everything you were looking for
in a lover,

17:24.984 --> 17:27.987
and, if I could embody some
of those things,

17:27.988 --> 17:30.114
maybe I would have a shot
with you.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.200
But then I found out
Horatio is real,

17:32.201 --> 17:33.951
and-and I couldn't bear to see
you do something like this

17:33.952 --> 17:35.495
to the family.

17:35.496 --> 17:37.330
It's not you, Lois.

17:37.331 --> 17:39.374
Wait, let me get this straight.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.959
You, without asking,
read something I wrote?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.003
Then, thinking I was revealing

17:44.004 --> 17:46.047
all my most intimate wants
and desires,

17:46.048 --> 17:47.715
you thought
that you could exploit

17:47.716 --> 17:50.009
what you read to seduce me?

17:50.010 --> 17:51.844
But when you thought
I might be cheating

17:51.845 --> 17:53.221
with someone
other than yourself,

17:53.222 --> 17:56.182
you found that, and only that,
morally objectionable?

17:56.183 --> 17:58.017
And you bring Stewie here,

17:58.018 --> 17:59.852
who doesn't understand any
of this?!

17:59.853 --> 18:01.145
I predict, in the finale,

18:01.146 --> 18:02.563
everyone can understand me.

18:02.564 --> 18:04.273
That'd make a good finale,
right?

18:04.274 --> 18:06.025
Brian, this is Horatio.

18:06.026 --> 18:07.902
He's special.

18:07.903 --> 18:09.612
I know you think he's special.

18:09.613 --> 18:11.114
No, he's special.

18:11.115 --> 18:12.907
He's learning disabled.

18:12.908 --> 18:15.118
I like Coldplay.

18:15.119 --> 18:17.245
- Ooh...
- Oh...

18:17.246 --> 18:19.497
I'm not having an affair
with him, Brian.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.999
I volunteered at the special
needs living facility,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.168
and Horatio happened
to like horses.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.379
So, once a week,
I take him to the stables.

18:26.380 --> 18:29.590
And the cape is from a Darth
Vader costume he had as a kid.

18:29.591 --> 18:31.926
Did you know he's the boss
of the stormtroopers?

18:31.927 --> 18:34.595
Yes, I have fantasies
about him dominating me

18:34.596 --> 18:36.055
with his idiot strength.

18:36.056 --> 18:37.223
But it's just that--

18:37.224 --> 18:38.725
a fantasy.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.393
That's why I wrote it
in a story,

18:40.394 --> 18:43.396
because I knew
that I would never act on it.

18:43.397 --> 18:44.897
Ugh. I never thought a dog

18:44.898 --> 18:47.692
could be such a genuine piece
of human garbage.

18:47.693 --> 18:48.860
Lois,

18:48.861 --> 18:51.112
I'm truly sorry
for what I thought.

18:51.113 --> 18:53.531
It all just made sense to me
at the time.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.950
But now that I see what it is,

18:55.951 --> 18:57.869
I'm ashamed of myself.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.954
I hope you can find it
in your heart...

18:59.955 --> 19:01.998
Hey, Bri.

19:01.999 --> 19:04.960
There's a good girl.

19:08.005 --> 19:09.088
Joe and Cleveland,

19:09.089 --> 19:11.341
are you ready to see
your new Peter?

19:16.013 --> 19:18.931
What do you guys think?

19:18.932 --> 19:20.349
I don't believe it.

19:20.350 --> 19:21.851
I'm speechless.

19:23.854 --> 19:27.024
Hey, look,
it's Jonah Hill sometimes!

19:33.572 --> 19:34.989
Wow!

19:34.990 --> 19:36.949
Looking good, Peter.

19:36.950 --> 19:39.494
Yes. I might want me
a little taste of that.

19:39.495 --> 19:41.496
Oh, well, Sheila, look out.

19:41.497 --> 19:43.831
Be careful what you ask for,
'cause you never know--

19:43.832 --> 19:45.666
I might--
Are-are you serious?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.168
'Cause I will do this, 100%.

19:47.169 --> 19:48.461
My wife's in, too.
I'll call her.

19:48.462 --> 19:50.129
We'll do a whole thing.

19:50.130 --> 19:52.673
Hey, Lois. I got a two-top.

19:52.674 --> 19:53.758
Okay.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.010
She's out, but I'm still in.

20:00.891 --> 20:01.974
Boy, I got to admit,

20:01.975 --> 20:03.893
I feel a little sheepish
to get so fooled

20:03.894 --> 20:05.937
by a silly little book
that Lois wrote.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.272
Yes, but, you know, I think
what we missed in all of this

20:08.273 --> 20:11.859
is that Lois wrote a beginning,
middle, and end to something.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.444
What have you written lately,
Brian?

20:13.445 --> 20:15.112
Well, nothing,
but, you know, I think--

20:15.113 --> 20:16.989
I think any writer knows
how hard it is

20:16.990 --> 20:18.658
to be staring
at that blank page.

20:18.659 --> 20:20.827
Sounds like
you did write something,

20:20.828 --> 20:22.662
your career's obituary.

20:23.997 --> 20:26.249
Well, that's our dog and baby!

20:26.250 --> 20:28.084
Hi, this is Chris Griffin.

20:28.085 --> 20:31.087
Boy, Lois had some
amorous adventures this week.

20:31.088 --> 20:33.422
But you know
what really turns me on?

20:33.423 --> 20:34.799
Reading.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.759
Why don't you get yourself
down to the library

20:36.760 --> 20:38.094
and open up a book!

20:38.095 --> 20:40.346
Here's a few
of my favorite books.

20:40.347 --> 20:42.598
J.D. Salinger's
Catcher in the Rye.

20:42.599 --> 20:45.184
The Kite Runner
by Khaled Hosseini.

20:45.185 --> 20:47.854
And, of course,
The Dirt by Motley Crue.

20:47.855 --> 20:50.064
Seriously, read The Dirt.

20:50.065 --> 20:52.859
They snort a row of live ants
like cocaine.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.528
Remember, kids,
a library card is free,

20:55.529 --> 20:57.864
but knowledge is priceless.

20:57.865 --> 21:01.118
Get that Dirt book.
