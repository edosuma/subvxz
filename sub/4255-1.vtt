02:30.609 --> 02:32.611
C'mon!

02:32.694 --> 02:35.781
C'mon! I got a baby-sitter.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.949
I don't wanna go.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.659
I don't wanna go
on my own.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.203
Trace!

02:41.286 --> 02:44.248
You got some clothes here,
haven't ya?

02:44.331 --> 02:46.166
C'mon, show us!

02:46.250 --> 02:49.920
Hey, Tran, don't you reckon Tracy
should come to the school reunion?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.547
Yeah.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.840
Is that right?

02:52.923 --> 02:54.383
Tracy never goes out.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.477
Listen.
We'll have a look here.

03:06.937 --> 03:07.980
You're alright?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.357
Yeah!
Good.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.822
Good Evening.
Can I have you bags, please?

03:20.993 --> 03:22.160
What have you got there?

03:22.244 --> 03:23.829
This one.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.433
G'day.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.518
How was it?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.019
It was okay.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.479
Did she behave herself?

04:30.521 --> 04:32.189
Yeah, not a problem.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.273
How was that?

04:33.315 --> 04:35.317
It was alright.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.236
Can we go?

04:37.319 --> 04:38.278
I'll drive.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.655
Can you give
me a ride home?

04:39.696 --> 04:42.491
No. You can walk, fatso.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.743
Excuse me.
Come here.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.414
I had a message from
Lionel Dawson on my phone.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.335
How did he get my number?

05:07.724 --> 05:10.185
"Hey, girl,
It's a new world"

05:10.227 --> 05:13.355
<i>let's have a little fun</i>

05:13.397 --> 05:15.858
<i>Don't stay hitting away</i>

05:15.899 --> 05:17.943
They play this one.
You should come.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.237
I wish you were there.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.244
You're gonna stay
very long?

05:27.327 --> 05:30.622
Kind of got sick of this.
I thought you were dead.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.333
I got my sun messy.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.085
Mom was there.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.087
I had to drive her home.

05:37.171 --> 05:41.175
Well, I gave her another call
but no, she didn't call back.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.593
You should go see her.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.344
Yeah.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.263
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that.

05:53.937 --> 05:54.897
What's up?

05:56.315 --> 05:57.274
Nah!

05:59.318 --> 06:01.945
Someone's, you know,
dropping something off for me.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.241
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.829
I didn't know
you were coming.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.253
Go on, right on the front room.

06:23.675 --> 06:24.760
Sorry, darling.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.432
Just a moment, Steven.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.687
Brad!

06:37.064 --> 06:38.106
What an honor.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.694
Lionel.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.123
I'll get you a drink.

06:55.207 --> 06:58.043
Working hard?

06:58.085 --> 07:02.840
I've sold quite
a few jerseys this week.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.759
Take the pressure off.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.722
Li!

07:10.806 --> 07:12.516
Lionel!

07:12.599 --> 07:13.725
Tracy!

07:30.742 --> 07:32.828
It's all yours now, mate.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.540
Yeah, partnership's dissolved.
I understand.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.834
It's all up to you now.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.756
So, that's it.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.926
Yeah, you're retiring.
That's great!

07:47.968 --> 07:50.637
As to this
particular arrangement.

07:52.764 --> 07:56.101
That's it.
The enamel packages.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.811
This is not for me.

07:57.853 --> 08:02.232
Yeah. Interesting timing. Like I've
been making arrangements for detox.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.781
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.658
I reckon this will be good for us.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.203
Clear the air.

08:14.286 --> 08:17.539
Won't be so dependant
at last.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.374
You'll have more time
not working.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.710
We can take up golf.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.171
Snooker.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.881
Fucking bridge.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.594
You're alright, then.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.138
Yeah, I couldn't be happier.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.405
It just began.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.084
Good luck, mate.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.254
Steven.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.538
Fuck!

09:39.621 --> 09:42.749
Sorry. I... forgot
you were there.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.293
Yeah, you did.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.391
It's you, ey?

10:00.392 --> 10:02.144
Shinny girl.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.605
I've gotta go.

10:04.688 --> 10:08.066
I have to stay.
It was spectacular.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.194
Jesus Christ, Lionel!

10:10.235 --> 10:13.238
Don't get on
when I'm here, alright?

10:13.322 --> 10:15.073
You wait till I go!

10:15.157 --> 10:17.326
I thought
you'd go in there and-

10:19.578 --> 10:20.704
Do you want this?

10:20.746 --> 10:22.039
No.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.707
I'll see ya.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.292
See ya, love.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.323
<i>Trace, are you up?</i>

11:36.446 --> 11:38.740
"Tracy, this business plan
Is good,"

11:38.824 --> 11:41.660
"It's very good, You've
obviously done a lot of research,"

11:41.702 --> 11:43.203
<i>It's very impressive,</i>

11:43.245 --> 11:44.872
"And this address
where you live,"

11:44.955 --> 11:46.707
<i>Is this rented property?</i>

11:46.790 --> 11:50.544
That's my mom's house.
It's rented, yeah.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.633
In the last four years
there's steady employment,

11:56.717 --> 12:00.137
but there's no savings,
no capital.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.556
You don't own a car?

12:02.639 --> 12:05.184
No, I've had some debts
to pay off.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.020
We do a credit check
on all loan applications

12:08.103 --> 12:10.856
and it is quite colorful
your file, Tracy.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.193
This isn't really really
safe estimate.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.111
Did you, did you see these?

12:16.195 --> 12:18.488
We get people coming in
to the shop all the time

12:18.572 --> 12:22.326
asking if we've got internet,
'cause we're so close to the station.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.496
The nearest place is-

12:27.206 --> 12:29.416
It's-

12:29.458 --> 12:33.045
Tracy, this is not a personal
decision. This is the bank's policy.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.380
I cannot approve
an unsecured line

12:35.464 --> 12:37.925
against someone
with your history.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.764
Sorry.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.183
Look, if you can come back
with some collateral

12:46.266 --> 12:48.143
we might be able
to talk again.

12:48.185 --> 12:52.439
But the way it's currently
structured I can't approve that loan.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.693
Okay?

13:00.489 --> 13:02.324
What?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.078
No, no, I won't do it.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.997
No, Ray,
I said no.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.837
<i>Hey, Trace,</i>

13:14.920 --> 13:18.090
The manager said
the plan was, uhm,

13:18.173 --> 13:21.677
What did he say?
It's impressive.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.137
Impressive?

13:25.639 --> 13:28.934
So, we'll sign off
our new shop on Monday.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.811
That gives you a week.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.897
Will the bank be able to
transfer the money by then?

13:33.981 --> 13:36.733
By Monday?
Yeah!

13:38.861 --> 13:41.947
Oh! Did you tell
your mom?

13:43.824 --> 13:46.243
Trace... did you call
you mom?

13:47.286 --> 13:49.830
Yeah, on the mobile.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.083
Net one plan.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.921
Do they have any computers
can we actually fit in there?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.882
Some shoes
for your brother.

14:06.013 --> 14:10.559
Ray gets his shoes done by that guy
of the street. I'm seeing him tonight.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.144
How is he going?
Come on, kids.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.228
Ray is Ray.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.147
Grab your bags.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.274
Hey, thanks for opening up
this morning.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.193
No problem.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.322
That'd be 12.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.406
Sorry?

14:24.489 --> 14:27.326
Computers.
Next door.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.411
Cool.
I'll see ya.

14:29.495 --> 14:31.371
See ya.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.541
Girls!
Wait up.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.816
Hello.
Ray Heart speaking.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.902
This is where I work.

15:01.985 --> 15:05.030
You get down here and get
the shit out of my shop.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.074
Do you hear me, Ray?

15:07.115 --> 15:11.954
Yeah. I'll get back to you in about five
minutes, alright? I'll call you straight back.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.623
Shit.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.669
Okay?

15:18.752 --> 15:20.420
Forty'd be good.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.714
What do you say?

15:26.176 --> 15:27.386
See you tonight?

15:27.469 --> 15:29.054
Yeah, give us a kiss.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.808
Is it alright if I bring
a friend over for dinner?

15:32.891 --> 15:34.601
Friend?

15:34.685 --> 15:36.478
Yeah, I do have him.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.314
Good. It's okay.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.066
See you tonight.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.320
Hi, Trace.

15:45.404 --> 15:48.156
Don't hang up on me, Ray.
You get down here

15:48.240 --> 15:50.409
and get this fucking shit
out of my shop

15:50.492 --> 15:52.578
or I'll throw it
in the bin.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.246
Just get here.

15:54.288 --> 15:57.499
I have to get a bus. I've only got
ten bucks to last me 'till Friday

15:57.583 --> 16:01.670
and it's Tuesday. Can you hold on
to it 'till tonight for me, Trace?

16:01.753 --> 16:03.630
It'd be a birthday present.

16:03.714 --> 16:06.300
Last time, Ray.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.762
Sorry.
Your password?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.428
Oh, Jesus Christ.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.858
I suppose a cup of tea
is out of the question.

17:13.492 --> 17:15.077
How's Ray?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.913
He's good.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.832
It's his birthday today.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.172
There's milk if you-

17:27.256 --> 17:30.175
No, still have it black.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.064
Tracy's doing well?

17:45.357 --> 17:47.651
Yes, she is. Lionel,
what are you doing here?

17:49.152 --> 17:51.655
Just came round to
say hello, that's all.

17:51.697 --> 17:52.739
Say hello.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.706
Haven't been to a show
in years.

18:00.789 --> 18:03.250
You and the kids
and me.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.420
Had some times, ey?

18:06.503 --> 18:09.298
Mainly in club
and races.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.466
Beach.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.472
I miss you.

18:17.556 --> 18:21.310
Lionel, you gave my daughter
heroin.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.896
Yeah.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.525
She's clean now.
She's good.

18:42.498 --> 18:44.124
This is for you.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.837
I don't want anything from
you. You can call a cab.

18:48.921 --> 18:51.798
It's Ray's birthday. I'm
cooking his favorite dinner.

18:51.882 --> 18:56.803
Tracy will be home soon.
And you were never here.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.192
Tran, I don't mind you
singing on the ship,

19:10.275 --> 19:12.069
but you got to get
the work done, too.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.492
Remember we got
that special?

19:18.575 --> 19:22.538
Two DVDs and you get a pack of that
crap popcorn. Give it away, Tran.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.934
Want me to pick him up
later?

19:44.017 --> 19:46.770
No, mate.
I'll put him in a taxi.

19:46.854 --> 19:49.940
Unless you want to stay
and watch the cable.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.984
I gotta get home.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.932
G'day, mate.

20:24.016 --> 20:25.267
Over there.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.360
Ray Heart?

20:35.444 --> 20:36.820
Yeah.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.322
Thanks for coming out here.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.073
Yeah.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.742
I got you a beer.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.744
No, thanks.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.917
So... is there a problem?

20:53.128 --> 20:55.506
I got some money together
with a friend of mine.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.799
We're looking
for opportunities to-

20:57.883 --> 20:58.967
How much money?

21:00.260 --> 21:02.804
About 30 grand.

21:02.846 --> 21:03.931
No bullshit.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.600
Why would I do that, mate?

21:08.894 --> 21:10.103
We're good for it.

21:12.189 --> 21:13.315
Fair enough.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.110
Give us a call tomorrow

21:17.194 --> 21:18.779
and I'll see
what we can do.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.659
Thanks.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.711
Well, he said a friend.
Isn't that what a friend means?

21:34.795 --> 21:38.006
Could be someone he talked to
at the bus stop.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.551
Look, it's his birthday.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.942
Trace, get the door, will ya?

21:57.025 --> 21:58.277
Why is he at the front-

21:58.360 --> 22:01.572
You know where the key is.
Use it!

22:15.836 --> 22:17.546
Shit!

22:19.381 --> 22:21.258
Ray's not here yet?

22:24.136 --> 22:26.180
I'll let you in the front.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.391
Is that Ray?

22:30.642 --> 22:31.727
It's Jonny.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.355
Isn't he in Vancouver?

22:35.439 --> 22:36.607
Not anymore.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.403
Shit.

22:41.486 --> 22:42.946
Janelle?

22:42.988 --> 22:46.366
Oh, well,
what have we got here?

22:47.493 --> 22:48.535
Come in.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.913
Trace.

22:52.664 --> 22:55.125
Duty free.
Do you still smoke?

22:57.377 --> 22:59.129
Ray told you
I was coming here?

22:59.171 --> 23:00.881
When did you get back?

23:02.716 --> 23:04.051
A couple
of days ago.

23:04.134 --> 23:05.969
Thanks.

23:07.346 --> 23:10.516
Here.
This is for you.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.478
Not real ones.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.147
Why are you wearing
a suit?

23:19.858 --> 23:21.985
Why I am wearing a suit?

23:22.069 --> 23:23.695
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.241
Hey!

23:29.576 --> 23:31.203
How are you going, Ray?

23:32.746 --> 23:34.081
Shit.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.214
So, you know,
in Vancouver

23:42.256 --> 23:46.718
people are making money 24-7
and that's all they do.

23:46.802 --> 23:48.804
They work and sleep.

23:48.887 --> 23:51.390
I don't suppose
they sleep much.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.683
That sounds like shit.

23:54.309 --> 23:56.103
You've been there, Janelle?

23:56.186 --> 24:01.108
No. Overseas I've been in
New Zealand, Fiji, and Bali.

24:01.191 --> 24:02.442
How long are you back for?

24:02.526 --> 24:04.695
For good.
Yeah.

24:05.779 --> 24:08.073
I've got a job offer here, so-

24:08.115 --> 24:09.449
What sort of a job?

24:09.491 --> 24:12.119
A trader
with a stockbroker.

24:12.202 --> 24:14.955
I worked with my uncle
in Canada in his company.

24:14.997 --> 24:16.957
They do the Asian market.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.042
It'd be pretty good money,
wouldn't it?

24:19.126 --> 24:21.211
Yeah.
It's alright.

24:22.838 --> 24:26.216
I'm also thinking about importing
those flowers I gave you.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.926
Thanks.

24:29.386 --> 24:31.597
How are you going?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.056
Good.

24:33.140 --> 24:35.392
She's doing great.
She's opening her own shop.

24:35.475 --> 24:39.354
Mom, I'm going into partnership with
Ming in my work at the video shop.

24:40.731 --> 24:43.609
We're expanding into internet
on-line gaming.

24:44.693 --> 24:46.320
And the bank.

24:50.699 --> 24:52.826
Yeah.

24:52.910 --> 24:54.912
The bank approved
my loan today.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.122
That's great!

24:58.499 --> 24:59.875
That's amazing.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.377
No, no, really!

25:03.921 --> 25:06.548
That is amazing.

25:13.013 --> 25:14.765
Don't just drop them
in a plate.

25:14.848 --> 25:16.391
How many times
have I done this?

25:16.475 --> 25:18.560
Happy birthday.

25:19.478 --> 25:20.729
Thanks.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.314
Don't drink it all.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.525
Anything but alcohol.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.819
A speech, Ray.

25:27.903 --> 25:29.571
Get fucked.
I want a big bit.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.033
I'd like to say a few words.

25:33.116 --> 25:35.327
Just a few, mom?

25:35.410 --> 25:39.164
Ray's 30.
My baby's 30.

25:40.624 --> 25:42.125
Five years ago
on this night,

25:42.167 --> 25:44.044
I stayed in a hospital
emergency room

25:44.127 --> 25:46.463
not knowing
if you were gonna live.

25:48.131 --> 25:51.593
I never wanna go through another
night like that in my life.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.137
It was a bad night.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.056
Bad night.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.977
And three years
of rehab for Ray and me.

26:01.979 --> 26:04.815
People from the past
knocking at the door.

26:08.277 --> 26:11.280
I suppose you think
about it. The accident.

26:12.447 --> 26:13.824
Every day, Janelle.

26:17.911 --> 26:20.330
So, when do you start work?

26:20.372 --> 26:22.875
Friday.
In the city.

26:22.958 --> 26:27.629
So I suppose now you'll be moving
out to Stratfield, somewhere.

26:27.713 --> 26:28.881
I don't know.

26:28.964 --> 26:31.049
I'm just staying with
Kim and June for now.

26:31.133 --> 26:34.970
You probably have noticed this but
people have been running from this place.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.681
Almost everyone. All the
houses have changed hands.

26:37.723 --> 26:41.101
Or kicking themselves. Prices
around here have gone up.

26:41.185 --> 26:43.854
People just want the best
they can for their families.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.148
Oh, right,
and I don't!

26:46.231 --> 26:48.066
That's not what I meant.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.986
Five years ago one's nearly
killed in a car crash.

26:51.069 --> 26:54.907
Other one is about to become a fully
blind junkie or find himself in jail.

26:54.990 --> 26:58.160
Or maybe bloody both!
So, what do I do?

26:58.243 --> 27:00.537
Can I send them off
to a rich family overseas?

27:00.579 --> 27:01.955
No.

27:02.039 --> 27:04.791
Can I get Tracy into the
clinics to get her clean? No!

27:04.875 --> 27:06.793
Mom, sit down.

27:06.877 --> 27:09.463
It'll be alright.
No matter what you do,

27:09.546 --> 27:11.715
always someone's there
to smooth it over.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.342
Need it?
Get it, sign the check.

27:13.425 --> 27:14.968
That would be alright.

27:15.052 --> 27:18.722
Maybe you shouldn't have married
such a loser asshole then.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.266
You gonna blame your dad
for the rest of your life?

27:21.308 --> 27:24.102
Probably yeah.

27:24.144 --> 27:27.481
Janelle, you would have done the
same things if you had the money.

27:27.564 --> 27:29.858
But I don't.
I didn't, I never did.

27:29.942 --> 27:32.236
You say you don't understand
these people.

27:32.319 --> 27:34.696
They're doing what you
would do if you could.

27:37.366 --> 27:39.326
Oh, I've had enough.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.292
Happy fucking birthday, Ray.

27:51.672 --> 27:54.466
Should I take it?

27:54.508 --> 27:55.676
So you can be all in.

27:55.759 --> 27:58.554
Yes, thank you.
That will be very nice.

28:01.265 --> 28:03.141
I'm fine, thank you.

28:03.183 --> 28:05.185
Okay, there you go.

28:08.522 --> 28:10.023
Darling.

28:10.065 --> 28:12.484
It's alright now.
Ray.

28:12.526 --> 28:15.028
Thanks for the shoot.

28:16.446 --> 28:19.241
Good night.

28:21.618 --> 28:22.703
Ray.

28:26.248 --> 28:27.791
I'm gonna bed.

28:35.549 --> 28:38.677
"Trace, are we gonna fit
12 computers In here?"

28:38.760 --> 28:40.345
Yeah, easily.

28:40.429 --> 28:44.141
Yeah, good.
This is cool.

28:44.224 --> 28:46.727
Fix the place up.
Make a bit of money.

28:46.768 --> 28:49.563
And you can refinance
and buy me out.

28:51.398 --> 28:53.066
What would you do?

28:53.150 --> 28:55.986
Oh, I'll be up at businesses.
Other things I wanna do.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.070
No, no, no.

28:57.154 --> 28:59.114
C'mon, Trace!
Why not?

28:59.156 --> 29:01.408
You've been doing it
for four years.

29:02.826 --> 29:05.204
You're a bloody great
manager.

29:08.999 --> 29:14.588
You know, it's bad luck for tears to
fall in the ground of a new business.

29:14.671 --> 29:17.049
Bullshit.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.467
Just think about it, ey?

29:18.509 --> 29:20.511
Yeah, right.

29:20.594 --> 29:22.513
Thanks.

29:24.723 --> 29:27.476
"The whales aren't believed
to be In any danger,"

29:27.559 --> 29:31.772
"But National Parks will stand
In guard to ensure proper traffic"

29:31.855 --> 29:33.690
<i>as well as whale watchers</i>

29:33.732 --> 29:37.486
"give the mammals
plenty of room to move,"

29:39.404 --> 29:43.784
You know, you should have told your
mom I was coming last night, prick.

29:45.327 --> 29:47.079
<i>Stay In memory,</i>

29:49.039 --> 29:50.791
Yeah, absolutely.

29:50.874 --> 29:53.710
Give us a look
at that fun, will you?

30:01.593 --> 30:02.719
This is weird.

30:02.803 --> 30:04.429
What?

30:09.935 --> 30:12.896
I don't know.
I just feel-

30:12.980 --> 30:15.190
Seeing you again
we'll be more together.

30:16.567 --> 30:18.443
What about this?

30:18.527 --> 30:20.529
Did you speak to that guy?

30:20.612 --> 30:22.114
Moss?

30:22.197 --> 30:25.117
I told him we had 30 grand,
mate, and his eyes went like this.

30:27.161 --> 30:30.664
C'mon, let's get out of here. I want
you to take me somewhere, will you?

30:31.623 --> 30:33.500
Ray, I can't drive like this.

30:33.584 --> 30:36.253
What's wrong? You're worried
you might have a crash?

30:44.469 --> 30:45.512
Sorry.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.709
Thanks, mate.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.086
No worries.

31:18.170 --> 31:20.005
Change those prices
for me.

31:20.047 --> 31:22.216
No worries.

31:22.299 --> 31:23.467
You're alright?

31:23.550 --> 31:25.469
Yeah. I've just got a bit of a cold.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.680
I'll drop in, uh, later in
the way. I'll give you a ring.

31:44.446 --> 31:45.906
Hello?

31:45.989 --> 31:47.825
Tracy, it's me.

31:47.908 --> 31:49.827
Jonny.

31:51.787 --> 31:53.413
How did you get
my number?

31:53.497 --> 31:55.207
Ray.

31:55.290 --> 31:58.377
Ray gave it to me.

31:58.460 --> 31:59.920
It's hard.

32:01.088 --> 32:03.048
It's hard being back.

32:03.090 --> 32:05.592
It's harder than I thought.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.929
Tracy, you're there?

32:11.306 --> 32:12.724
I gotta go.

32:12.766 --> 32:13.892
See ya.

32:13.976 --> 32:16.186
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

32:24.820 --> 32:25.988
You're okay?

32:26.071 --> 32:28.282
Yeah.

32:28.365 --> 32:29.408
You're okay?

32:29.491 --> 32:31.952
Yeah, just wanna get home.

32:52.806 --> 32:56.310
And Jonny wouldn't speak.

32:56.393 --> 32:59.146
He had just lost his parents.

32:59.188 --> 33:02.274
A feeling
I will never forget.

33:02.357 --> 33:04.026
As time goes on-

33:15.120 --> 33:18.457
But Jonny has been
in Vancouver for four years.

33:18.540 --> 33:21.627
He has been working
very hard.

33:21.710 --> 33:24.671
And he has a new job here
in Sydney.

33:24.755 --> 33:26.715
A stockbroker.

33:38.101 --> 33:42.397
Today is 20 years
since I married June.

33:59.957 --> 34:02.125
June, thank you.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.467
I don't know, Lionel.

34:10.551 --> 34:13.887
You've got to do something.
Never had to pay for it.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.054
A straight price?

34:15.138 --> 34:16.849
I never had to find it.

34:16.931 --> 34:20.476
No, I won't stand up in front of a
bunch of people and say that I was wrong,

34:20.561 --> 34:24.147
that my life was wrong,
because it wasn't. It isn't.

34:25.858 --> 34:28.402
I gotta strip for this
Salbutan and just wait.

34:28.485 --> 34:30.027
Really?

34:30.112 --> 34:32.489
Yeah, I'll be fine.
One week and I'm clean.

34:32.531 --> 34:35.868
One week?
Yeah, right.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.873
M'mmmm.

34:41.956 --> 34:44.668
How good is that?

34:44.751 --> 34:46.587
Yummy.

34:46.670 --> 34:47.838
Aren't you having any?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.464
No.

35:02.519 --> 35:03.645
Jonny's back.

35:05.564 --> 35:06.899
Eh?

35:09.568 --> 35:10.777
How is he?

35:12.446 --> 35:14.948
He's great.
He's clean.

35:15.032 --> 35:16.116
He's a stockbroker.

35:20.287 --> 35:22.289
Let him on the phone
in the morning.

35:25.959 --> 35:28.086
Most stupid.

35:28.879 --> 35:31.340
No.

35:31.423 --> 35:34.301
No boyfriend causes such a
commotion. What does that say?

35:36.220 --> 35:37.429
It's okay.

35:37.471 --> 35:40.098
Yeah.
Is it?

35:41.475 --> 35:43.477
Yeah, it is.

35:46.313 --> 35:47.314
It's great.

35:50.567 --> 35:53.904
The look on your face
after you spoke to him.

35:53.987 --> 35:55.697
And now it's beyond that.

35:55.781 --> 35:58.617
I'd kill for that feeling.

36:02.871 --> 36:04.414
You got your stuff?

36:04.498 --> 36:09.837
Trace... I haven't been
to the beach for years

36:09.878 --> 36:13.799
and what is all.
Like I'm on public.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.347
I'll take you
to the beach.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.396
You're my darling.

36:28.564 --> 36:30.190
Eat something.

36:35.988 --> 36:37.030
Bye-bye.

36:37.072 --> 36:39.074
See you, darling.

37:01.763 --> 37:03.223
Do you like trading?

37:03.265 --> 37:05.767
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

37:05.851 --> 37:09.021
It's fun playing with other
people's money, you know.

37:09.104 --> 37:11.273
I'm impressed.

37:11.356 --> 37:14.610
A car.
Mr. Cool C.

37:14.693 --> 37:16.403
The car's me uncle's.

37:22.242 --> 37:23.243
Tracy.

37:23.327 --> 37:24.995
How you're going?

37:25.078 --> 37:26.914
I'm good.
What are you doing?

37:26.997 --> 37:28.207
Now?

37:28.290 --> 37:30.501
Yes.

37:30.584 --> 37:31.585
Nothing.

37:31.668 --> 37:33.295
Do you-

37:33.378 --> 37:35.297
Do you wanna meet up?

37:35.339 --> 37:38.509
Yeah, we could meet
on the corner, you know.

37:38.592 --> 37:40.052
I don't have a car.

37:41.386 --> 37:43.931
I can, I can pick you up.

37:45.557 --> 37:47.017
At 7: 00?

37:47.059 --> 37:48.644
I'll take you
to the city.

37:48.685 --> 37:50.771
This is a really
cool restaurant.

37:50.854 --> 37:52.314
Yeah, right.

37:52.356 --> 37:54.024
Alright.

37:54.107 --> 37:56.527
Okay.
Bye.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.080
Hey.

38:50.122 --> 38:52.249
Hi.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.384
You wanna drive?

39:03.969 --> 39:04.970
Okay.

39:21.778 --> 39:27.117
I've got to know
if this is the real sea

39:43.467 --> 39:44.927
How are you going?

39:45.969 --> 39:46.970
Good.

39:47.054 --> 39:49.014
You look great.

39:53.477 --> 39:55.854
You really changed
since I left.

39:59.733 --> 40:03.278
Tracy, You know I-
I didn't have a choice.

40:03.362 --> 40:07.241
My uncle sent me away
and my bags were packed.

40:07.282 --> 40:09.368
I had no time
to see anyone.

40:11.078 --> 40:12.579
Four years.

40:13.580 --> 40:15.249
Yeah.

40:18.252 --> 40:21.421
Anyway, look at you.
You look great.

40:21.505 --> 40:24.258
Yeah, 32.

40:24.299 --> 40:27.678
Living home with my mom
and work in a video shop.

40:31.098 --> 40:33.809
Do you think
if I'd stayed,

40:33.892 --> 40:35.018
you'd be clean now?

40:37.604 --> 40:40.899
Fuck knows
where we'd be.

40:40.983 --> 40:46.822
Scarlet for me
and scarlet for you

40:58.667 --> 41:00.294
What do you wanna eat?

41:00.377 --> 41:03.380
I bet the food
is pretty good here.

41:03.463 --> 41:07.384
Is that what you heard? Like
you read restaurant reviews.

41:08.468 --> 41:10.345
Certain times I do, yeah.

41:11.555 --> 41:14.141
Are you ready to order?

41:14.183 --> 41:16.018
What'd you like?

41:19.688 --> 41:21.732
Take your time.
I'll come back.

41:24.359 --> 41:26.195
You're okay?

41:26.236 --> 41:28.405
I don't wanna be here.
I'm wanna go.

41:30.115 --> 41:31.158
Tracy.

41:31.241 --> 41:32.826
No, I just
wanna go home, okay?

41:36.622 --> 41:39.666
This is a bad idea.

41:39.750 --> 41:40.751
Where are you going?

41:40.834 --> 41:41.835
I'm going home.

41:41.919 --> 41:43.045
Let me drive.

41:43.128 --> 41:44.338
No, no, no.

41:44.421 --> 41:45.964
Don't grab me!

41:46.048 --> 41:48.717
Don't think
you can fucking... grab me.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.802
Tracy, c'mon.

41:50.886 --> 41:52.262
What am I doing here?

41:55.599 --> 41:58.560
This is so easy for you!

41:58.602 --> 42:00.687
Is it easy?

42:02.940 --> 42:05.067
What do you reckon, huh?

42:13.700 --> 42:16.620
I want to drive you home, okay?

42:24.127 --> 42:24.628
"Mr. Bush spoke
to Mr. Howard"

42:26.797 --> 42:28.882
"about getting at least
the understanding"

42:46.942 --> 42:47.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:48.026 --> 42:48.986
What?

42:50.362 --> 42:52.656
Is that loaded?

42:52.698 --> 42:56.326
Nah, it's my farewell present when
I sold the bar in the Philippines.

42:56.368 --> 42:59.371
Some bastard
tried to impress me.

42:59.413 --> 43:01.874
I never used it.

43:03.125 --> 43:04.751
It's beautifully
handcrafted.

43:04.835 --> 43:07.171
Why don't you keep it?
I'm retiring.

43:07.254 --> 43:08.463
Oh, no.

43:08.547 --> 43:09.798
No, I want you
to have it.

43:11.425 --> 43:12.759
I'm not a collector, mate.

43:12.843 --> 43:14.803
Do you want a beer?
I poured you one.

43:14.887 --> 43:16.430
No, I might keep going.

43:16.513 --> 43:18.432
There's some white wine
in the fridge.

43:18.515 --> 43:21.185
Jenny's getting a bit jacked
up at me showing up late.

43:21.268 --> 43:24.855
So, if there's nothing else,
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:24.938 --> 43:26.398
Yeah, alright.

43:26.440 --> 43:27.816
At 10: 00?

43:27.900 --> 43:29.401
Sure.

43:30.235 --> 43:31.695
Hey,

43:31.778 --> 43:33.739
what ever happened
to that Barky couple

43:33.822 --> 43:36.325
who ran the speed factory
for us?

43:36.408 --> 43:38.327
Merv and Eileen.

43:38.410 --> 43:41.079
Where did they go?

43:41.163 --> 43:43.373
Kangaroo Valley, I think.

43:43.457 --> 43:45.083
They've got some goats
up there.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.794
Goats.

43:50.255 --> 43:52.007
I just wanna get things
finalized.

43:52.090 --> 43:54.009
Lawyer's on the case.
You understand?

43:54.092 --> 43:56.261
Yeah, yeah, sure.

43:56.345 --> 43:57.596
Steven,

43:57.638 --> 43:59.515
just sit down
for a minute, will you?

43:59.598 --> 44:01.892
I know you wanna get back
to your family.

44:10.025 --> 44:11.568
Come.

44:11.652 --> 44:15.864
I know some things about me
that you found... difficult.

44:16.990 --> 44:19.493
I wanna say this.

44:19.576 --> 44:21.995
I know what sort of man
you are,

44:22.037 --> 44:24.957
and your thoughts about such
matters won't make things-

44:25.040 --> 44:26.917
I'm not one
to judge, mate.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.255
I just wanna...thank you
for your trust and discretion.

44:32.714 --> 44:34.508
Okay.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

44:34.591 --> 44:36.093
Yeah, alright.

44:38.262 --> 44:39.429
Right.

44:39.513 --> 44:41.181
Okay.

44:44.309 --> 44:45.811
Bradly's got no idea.

44:45.894 --> 44:48.772
He hasn't been down to
the speed factory in years.

44:48.856 --> 44:51.483
He just wants to fuck boys
and play golf.

44:51.567 --> 44:53.193
What if he goes down there?

44:53.277 --> 44:54.903
Well, then he does.

44:54.987 --> 44:57.531
Merv and Eileen can deal
with it. Honestly, Stevy.

44:59.283 --> 45:01.827
I hurt my nose!

45:01.910 --> 45:02.911
Is there any blood?

45:04.538 --> 45:06.290
Is she alright?

45:06.373 --> 45:07.833
Just a little bit.

45:07.916 --> 45:09.877
My bunny, my bunny.

45:09.918 --> 45:12.588
Oh, that's alright
'cause we've got him now!

45:12.671 --> 45:16.592
We silly duffers.
These toys are shit.

45:16.633 --> 45:18.927
Bloody dangerous, too.

45:19.011 --> 45:21.263
You know, Tiny and Jean
have got a new floor.

45:21.346 --> 45:23.348
You can just lay
straight over the slab.

45:23.432 --> 45:24.892
Yeah? Good.

45:24.975 --> 45:27.644
Here we go. It's okay, it's
okay, honey. There you go.

45:27.728 --> 45:29.938
Sh, sh, sh,
There.

45:30.022 --> 45:31.940
There we go.

45:34.234 --> 45:35.903
So, this is what
we're doing.

45:35.986 --> 45:39.239
So, we can save for a whole
new floor and we can have it.

45:39.323 --> 45:41.450
It's worth it.

45:41.492 --> 45:44.661
Yeah.

45:44.745 --> 45:48.248
"Move along the outside,
Now Springsfur is pushing up,"

45:48.332 --> 45:51.043
"And now Camel has dropped
to the tall,"

45:51.126 --> 45:54.880
"Springsfur by four,
Second Is Camel,"

46:17.694 --> 46:21.156
"Tracy, you're brother's here,
C'mon, please,"

46:40.759 --> 46:42.010
He's not here.

46:42.094 --> 46:44.388
Having a good perv?

46:44.429 --> 46:46.348
You're losing your touch.

46:50.561 --> 46:53.522
Why didn't you wake me?
I missed my swim.

46:53.605 --> 46:56.358
I did try to wake you, but
if my memory says me correctly

46:56.441 --> 46:58.110
you told me
to fuck off, mum.

46:58.193 --> 47:00.070
Sorry.

47:00.112 --> 47:02.614
Mum, just drop her off here.
She can get the train.

47:02.656 --> 47:04.491
I'm late.

47:04.575 --> 47:06.785
Here's the station, Trace.

47:16.545 --> 47:18.297
Where're you going, anyway?

47:18.380 --> 47:20.424
I don't know.
It's a surprise.

47:20.507 --> 47:23.093
Yeah, it's just somewhere
never you mind.

47:24.553 --> 47:27.598
Go right here.
Mum, mum? Go.

47:27.639 --> 47:30.225
Oh, don't.
Stop it, for goodness sake!

47:30.309 --> 47:32.895
We're going to take forever
to get back on the freeway.

47:32.978 --> 47:36.273
I'll take Tracy to work.
Laura picks her up, right?

47:36.356 --> 47:38.942
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:41.862 --> 47:42.821
Mum?

47:42.905 --> 47:45.324
Just wait, please.
Trace!

47:49.703 --> 47:51.747
Did you go out
with Jonny last night?

47:51.830 --> 47:53.665
Yeah.

47:56.710 --> 47:58.086
Okay.

47:59.630 --> 48:00.631
Hey, mom?

48:02.883 --> 48:04.343
Give us a kiss.

48:09.181 --> 48:12.434
Oh, no, no, no!
Naughty girl!

48:12.518 --> 48:14.436
Like the lesbians?

48:14.520 --> 48:15.729
You have a good day.

48:20.025 --> 48:23.403
Could you not clap lesbian-

48:41.129 --> 48:42.798
Doesn't it go in the Ts?

48:42.881 --> 48:44.508
No.

48:44.591 --> 48:46.426
I'll look for it Ivonne
as a customer.

48:46.510 --> 48:48.053
Would you?

48:49.680 --> 48:51.473
When do you find out
about the bank?

48:52.474 --> 48:54.726
This afternoon.

48:56.645 --> 49:00.190
You told Janelle you got
the loan approved already.

49:00.274 --> 49:01.942
Yeah.

49:02.025 --> 49:03.902
Did you tell her
anything different?

49:03.986 --> 49:05.654
No!

49:08.490 --> 49:11.618
The party's right here.
It's right here!

49:13.370 --> 49:14.454
Are you alright?

49:14.496 --> 49:15.622
Yeah.

49:15.706 --> 49:18.125
Just I didn't sleep much
last night.

49:18.167 --> 49:20.752
You're racing or you
just watching some TV?

49:25.048 --> 49:26.383
I went out with Jonny.

49:28.677 --> 49:30.345
Are you alright?

49:30.387 --> 49:31.722
It's a change.

49:31.805 --> 49:34.183
Didn't you and Janelle
have a chitty chat about that?

49:34.266 --> 49:35.809
Tracy.

49:37.269 --> 49:41.106
Lionel Dawson. Okay, I can
buy that. He's an old friend.

49:41.190 --> 49:42.900
Do you think
this is okay?

49:42.983 --> 49:46.904
He's straight.
Straighter than you.

49:46.945 --> 49:49.031
Do you feel okay
about being around him?

49:49.114 --> 49:51.116
I can handle it.

49:52.951 --> 49:54.244
You don't know him!

49:54.328 --> 49:56.371
No, I don't.

49:59.750 --> 50:01.960
He's a stockbroker.

50:03.378 --> 50:06.340
Went to this really nice
restaurant in the city.

50:10.010 --> 50:11.428
What?

50:11.470 --> 50:14.515
You look scared. I haven't
seen that look for a while.

50:14.598 --> 50:17.309
There's this big fucking
empty space.

50:17.392 --> 50:18.519
Tracy, it's okay.

50:18.602 --> 50:20.020
I'm fucking fine.

50:20.103 --> 50:21.271
Take it easy.

50:26.360 --> 50:29.571
<i>Brad, It's Lionel,</i>

50:29.613 --> 50:33.534
"If you're there, mate, please pick
up, I really need to talk to you,"

50:33.617 --> 50:35.869
<i>Brad, It's Lionel again,</i>

50:35.953 --> 50:38.997
"Please, call me, mate,
Okay?"

50:39.081 --> 50:41.750
It's the third time today.

50:47.714 --> 50:49.466
Your wife's outside.

50:52.135 --> 50:54.221
She's got a key.

50:57.766 --> 51:00.269
Look at these fucking boxes.

51:00.352 --> 51:02.479
There are people waiting.

51:02.521 --> 51:05.732
Can I stay today?
Please?

51:10.988 --> 51:12.698
If you want to arrange this,

51:14.283 --> 51:15.701
you talk to me.

51:15.742 --> 51:18.245
'Cause I fucking live here,
not her.

51:18.328 --> 51:19.997
I co-owned, Bradley.

51:20.038 --> 51:21.707
C'mon, Steven.

51:21.748 --> 51:24.251
You fucking prick.

51:24.334 --> 51:27.379
"Do you know
whose house Is this?"

51:27.462 --> 51:30.174
"Bradley Thompson's,
What?"

51:30.257 --> 51:32.342
Don't you want to have
a look inside?

51:32.426 --> 51:33.760
Ray!

51:33.844 --> 51:36.763
It's open for inspection, mom!
Look, anyone can go in.

51:38.432 --> 51:40.100
How did you find out
about it?

51:41.268 --> 51:43.520
I just ready it in the paper. C'mon.

52:24.937 --> 52:28.273
"Hi, my name Is Tracy Heart, I had
an appointment with Donna Suvani,"

52:30.651 --> 52:33.987
It's just that I need to secure
the loan as soon as possible.

52:36.031 --> 52:37.282
No.

52:37.366 --> 52:39.159
Okay.
No, that's great.

52:39.243 --> 52:41.703
Yeah, yeah. I'll be there. Thank you.

52:41.745 --> 52:43.580
Excuse me.

52:43.664 --> 52:46.834
I've gotta close the shop.
Do you want anything?

52:50.587 --> 52:53.465
I'm gonna get change.
I'll be two minutes.

52:58.303 --> 53:00.097
It's Trace.

53:07.896 --> 53:10.065
Oh, honey, I forgot
how painful this is.

53:10.149 --> 53:12.693
It's fucking horrible.

53:14.945 --> 53:17.531
I'll be back
in a couple of hours, alright?

53:22.202 --> 53:26.582
I call Brad so many times but he
hasn't called back. I don't understand.

53:26.623 --> 53:29.668
Sorry, Lionel,
but I gotta go.

53:31.587 --> 53:33.589
I'll be back
really soon, alright?

53:33.672 --> 53:35.299
Okay.

53:43.473 --> 53:46.185
Hi. I'm here to see
Donna Suvani.

53:46.268 --> 53:48.437
M'h-hm.
Take a seat.

54:00.741 --> 54:05.662
Yeah, it's alright.
It's about half an hour trip.

54:05.704 --> 54:08.373
Hi, Jonny. Steven Moss.
Steven, this is Jonny Nguyen.

54:08.457 --> 54:09.458
How are ya?

54:09.541 --> 54:11.168
Good, good, good.

54:13.962 --> 54:15.422
I'm sorry, excuse me.

54:24.223 --> 54:26.558
Hi.

54:26.642 --> 54:28.894
Where are you?

54:28.977 --> 54:32.105
With some friends at
the club. Where are you?

54:32.189 --> 54:36.610
I'm just sorting out some-
Finishing up the bank stuff.

54:36.693 --> 54:40.823
It's kind of hard for me
to talk right now.

54:40.906 --> 54:42.074
Sure, sorry.

54:42.157 --> 54:44.201
No, that's fine.

54:45.619 --> 54:47.704
It's great you called.

54:49.706 --> 54:50.958
I missed you.

54:51.041 --> 54:53.502
I just, I wanted to say
that last night-

54:53.585 --> 54:55.671
Tracy, listen,
I'll call you.

54:55.754 --> 54:58.090
Okay?
I have to finish here.

54:59.591 --> 55:02.177
Excuse me.
You can go in now.

55:02.261 --> 55:03.303
I've gotta go.

55:07.766 --> 55:09.685
G'day, Tracy.

55:09.768 --> 55:11.937
How are you?

55:12.020 --> 55:13.939
Sit down.
Wait me a second.

55:18.110 --> 55:20.529
Bloody computers.

55:21.488 --> 55:23.323
He's cute.

55:23.407 --> 55:25.534
You want kids?

55:25.617 --> 55:27.452
Don't know.

55:29.121 --> 55:31.331
I've got a friend who's having
a second baby.

55:31.415 --> 55:33.750
Really?
He's nice.

55:33.792 --> 55:35.669
A lot of work.

55:35.752 --> 55:38.297
Have you got
a boyfriend?

55:38.380 --> 55:40.299
Would it help the loan
if I did?

55:42.259 --> 55:44.261
Maybe.

55:44.303 --> 55:45.804
Okay.

55:45.846 --> 55:48.140
Now, the business loan.

55:48.182 --> 55:51.143
I'm really sorry, Tracy,
but there's no way

55:51.185 --> 55:54.813
I can approve this loan
for you today.

55:54.855 --> 55:56.815
I think you probably
know why.

55:58.025 --> 55:59.443
Okay.

55:59.526 --> 56:01.653
But what if I reduce
the amount a little bit?

56:01.737 --> 56:05.657
Instead of making it
40 thousand I made it 25.

56:05.699 --> 56:10.078
The business is great but it's a lease
premises. There's no real capital.

56:10.162 --> 56:13.332
If the bank did have to come in,
there'll be nothing to recoup on it.

56:13.373 --> 56:15.876
The capital'll be built
into the new shop.

56:15.918 --> 56:18.212
The computers, the stock,
the customer base.

56:18.295 --> 56:22.216
Tracy, is there someone you
can get to help you out with it?

56:22.257 --> 56:24.218
Maybe get your dad
to go guarantor.

56:24.259 --> 56:27.221
That's not gonna happen. I'm
not asking for a gift here.

56:27.304 --> 56:29.223
I'll be paying it back.

56:29.306 --> 56:31.058
Tracy, we did a credit check
on you.

56:31.141 --> 56:33.852
I'm paying it off.
I've organized it.

56:33.894 --> 56:36.188
Di-di-
I'm paying it off!

56:36.230 --> 56:39.858
Look here. "Have you been refused
credits in the last ten years?"

56:39.942 --> 56:42.528
You ticked the box No
when you should've ticked Yes.

56:42.110 --> 56:44.863
No one ticks Yes.
It just meant fucking no!

56:44.947 --> 56:49.117
You think by ticking No when you should've
ticked Yes is not gonna count against you?

56:49.201 --> 56:51.078
We do check
these things here, Tracy.

56:51.119 --> 56:54.248
We know that you've been
charged with credit card fraud.

56:56.917 --> 56:59.670
So this bank has never
lent money to criminals?

56:59.753 --> 57:03.048
Okay, this is impolite. I think
we should just take a deep breath.

57:03.090 --> 57:06.426
Yeah. Well, sorry to be taking
up your precious fucking time!

57:20.941 --> 57:22.151
Is it good?

57:24.403 --> 57:25.612
Good.

57:25.696 --> 57:27.364
Okay.

57:27.447 --> 57:28.657
Alright.

57:28.740 --> 57:30.909
Good to meet you.

57:33.453 --> 57:35.414
Hey, Ray.

57:40.627 --> 57:42.504
What were you doing
this morning?

57:42.588 --> 57:44.381
I saw you
on the street, idiot.

57:44.464 --> 57:45.841
Open for inspection, mate.

57:45.924 --> 57:48.135
We're good.
We're good.

57:51.138 --> 57:55.184
Any reason you're useful is you're a
fucking speck a thousand miles from anyone.

57:55.267 --> 57:58.312
If by accident we do meet,
you look straight through me

57:58.353 --> 58:02.149
and I'll do likewise.
Yeh?

58:02.232 --> 58:05.444
Yeh, yeh, sure.
Whatever.

58:08.822 --> 58:10.866
We're still home.

58:53.033 --> 58:54.993
I'll get you
a cup of tea.

59:13.762 --> 59:18.016
I can't do this.

59:18.058 --> 59:19.560
It's so fucking ugly.

59:19.601 --> 59:21.228
I'm calling an ambulance.

59:21.311 --> 59:23.772
No, I don't want
an ambulance, Tracy.

59:23.856 --> 59:25.899
What do you want?

59:25.941 --> 59:29.236
The paid stuff.
In there!

59:38.745 --> 59:40.205
I'm sorry, Trace.

59:40.289 --> 59:41.874
It's alright.

59:41.957 --> 59:43.417
I fucking stink.

59:43.458 --> 59:45.711
Don't worry about it.

59:54.636 --> 59:58.098
How many times
do you do this?

59:58.140 --> 59:59.183
Four.

59:59.266 --> 01:00:01.435
Four. Fuck!

01:00:01.477 --> 01:00:03.061
Is it worth it?

01:00:03.103 --> 01:00:07.441
In reality bull fucking shit.

01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:09.776
Lionel, if you can't get it
for free anymore,

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.572
your life is gonna get
fucked up really fast.

01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:16.450
Just gotta be strong.

01:00:16.492 --> 01:00:17.951
Tracy, shush.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:20.412
Sorry.

01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:22.122
No, Trace.

01:00:22.206 --> 01:00:23.832
I went saw Janelle.

01:00:26.043 --> 01:00:29.087
She hates me.
She still hates me.

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:32.424
I'm no good, you know.

01:00:32.508 --> 01:00:35.886
Turned everything to shit.
Janelle, you.

01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:37.346
You've no fucking idea.

01:00:37.429 --> 01:00:40.224
Mom's life was up to shit
before she met you.

01:00:40.307 --> 01:00:45.687
We were going out to Chinese
restaurants with Lionel Dawson.

01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:50.692
Going down the beach with
fucking Lionel fucking Dawson!

01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:53.362
Then when we went out,
we came home in taxis!

01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:56.156
So we were famous, too.

01:00:58.158 --> 01:01:00.619
Mom!

01:01:00.702 --> 01:01:03.956
Mom went, we went fucking
mad. We didn't know anyone.

01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:07.000
This was like
a fucking game.

01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:09.503
No, no.
God!

01:01:11.004 --> 01:01:12.840
It's 'cause you loved us.

01:01:12.923 --> 01:01:15.592
Alright? You fucking loved us
and you didn't have to.

01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:24.601
I loved both of them.
You know I loved them both

01:01:24.685 --> 01:01:27.771
and they're both fucking gone
for me. Your mum and Brad.

01:01:27.855 --> 01:01:31.817
I really thought that I'd
get a happy-ever-after.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.445
I didn't-
Honestly, Trace, I-

01:01:35.529 --> 01:01:37.906
I never thought this-

01:01:41.618 --> 01:01:46.748
Trace, I'm fucking scared. I can't go
through another air of this, you know, please.

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:49.626
Darling, there's money
in the wardrobe, ey?

01:01:50.836 --> 01:01:53.213
Please, darling, ey?

01:01:53.255 --> 01:01:54.715
Look, I'm sorry.

01:01:56.133 --> 01:01:57.926
You know,
you know!

01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:01.930
I can't school for you, Lionel.

01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:06.560
Fuck!

01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:09.229
How could you
even ask me to?

01:02:09.313 --> 01:02:11.565
'Cause there's no one else
that fucking has.

01:02:11.607 --> 01:02:14.902
There's fucking no one.
There's fucking no one!

01:02:40.219 --> 01:02:43.388
Tracy, what the fuck
you've been doing?

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:46.141
It's not for me.

01:02:46.225 --> 01:02:48.519
So, how much do you want?

01:02:48.602 --> 01:02:51.438
Three Gs.

01:02:52.356 --> 01:02:55.150
Yeah, I can do it.

01:02:55.234 --> 01:02:57.027
You call this number
in ten minutes.

01:03:12.918 --> 01:03:14.294
You have
the correct money?

01:03:14.378 --> 01:03:16.797
Yeah.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.966
Alright?

01:03:28.392 --> 01:03:30.644
Excuse me.
Is there a toilet in there?

01:03:30.686 --> 01:03:32.062
Yeah, in that door.

01:03:57.796 --> 01:04:01.675
"There's no change,
there's no pace"

01:04:01.758 --> 01:04:05.220
<i>Everything within Its place</i>

01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:09.558
"Just makes It harder
to believe"

01:04:09.641 --> 01:04:13.187
<i>she won't be around</i>

01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:17.024
"And I'm wondering
If he'll go"

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:20.903
<i>or If he'll stay</i>

01:04:20.986 --> 01:04:23.071
<i>Do you remember</i>

01:04:23.155 --> 01:04:27.284
"nothing stopped us
on the field"

01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:30.954
<i>In our day</i>

01:04:31.038 --> 01:04:38.754
"Oh the flame trees will blind
the weary driver"

01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:41.465
<i>And there's nothing else</i>

01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:44.760
"could set fire
to this town"

01:04:46.803 --> 01:04:50.516
"There's no change,
there's no pace"

01:04:50.557 --> 01:04:54.895
<i>Everything within Its place</i>

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:07.616
Just ringing.

01:05:07.699 --> 01:05:08.951
Trace, it's me.

01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:11.495
Hey, where are you?

01:05:11.578 --> 01:05:14.248
At your place. I mean, I
thought you might be here.

01:05:14.331 --> 01:05:15.457
And your mom, she's-

01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:18.919
Trace, you're alright?
What's happened?

01:05:18.961 --> 01:05:21.004
Did you shut the shop?

01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:22.548
No.

01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:25.592
Ming rang here looking for you
because the shop was shut up,

01:05:25.676 --> 01:05:28.470
so you did shut the shop.

01:05:30.472 --> 01:05:32.683
Yeah, I had to do something.

01:05:32.766 --> 01:05:34.434
What's that noise?
Where are you?

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:44.278
She's at the train station.

01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:49.533
Trace?
Trace are you there?

01:05:49.616 --> 01:05:50.742
What?

01:05:50.826 --> 01:05:54.121
Do you want a lift?
Got me car here.

01:05:54.163 --> 01:05:55.164
Yeah.

01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:56.665
I'm on my way.
Just wait.

01:05:56.748 --> 01:05:58.876
Okay?

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:01.295
Yeah, alright.

01:06:02.754 --> 01:06:04.590
I'm gonna go get her.

01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:05.632
Why is she there?

01:06:05.716 --> 01:06:08.468
She's getting a train.

01:06:08.552 --> 01:06:10.137
Oh, funny!

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.599
You've got no fucking idea what
you're dealing with here, have you?

01:06:13.682 --> 01:06:16.727
You come swanning in here like
Lord Prince fucking up himself

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:19.480
and Tracy's
at the train station, Jonny,

01:06:19.563 --> 01:06:22.816
where people fucking buy
drugs, where they score.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.987
Where I have to scrape off and kick
her up off the fucking pavement.

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:28.363
I'm gonna go get her.

01:06:28.447 --> 01:06:31.116
Don't you hurt her!

01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:34.870
Like I hurt Ray.

01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:39.208
Just bring her home.

01:06:41.919 --> 01:06:43.754
I'll take her
where she wants to go.

01:07:16.411 --> 01:07:18.455
Lionel?

01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:20.415
Yeah.

01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:25.128
It's alright, Trace.
Just have to ask him.

01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:36.849
Can't you see
what it costs?

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:38.642
You can't keep it up.

01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:45.149
I own this place
and I have the business.

01:07:45.232 --> 01:07:47.776
Look, I've got
things there.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:51.989
I have Jerseys, fine ones.

01:07:52.072 --> 01:07:54.408
Some of them
are priceless, you know.

01:07:55.576 --> 01:07:57.494
From a priceless past.

01:08:01.081 --> 01:08:02.666
You go right now, ey?

01:08:07.838 --> 01:08:10.090
You're so beautiful.

01:08:13.552 --> 01:08:16.180
Go, hon,
you go away.

01:08:17.639 --> 01:08:20.559
I won't do it again, Lionel.
Don't ask me.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.437
No, yeah,
I understand.

01:08:25.647 --> 01:08:26.939
Thank you.

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:19.660
You know what I think about
when I think about you?

01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:24.372
I think about kissing you.

01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:30.420
When we used to-

01:09:30.504 --> 01:09:34.883
just spend the whole afternoon
just lying in bed.

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:37.928
Kissing.

01:09:40.305 --> 01:09:43.642
I don't think I've kissed
you when I wasn't out of it.

01:09:54.778 --> 01:09:56.029
Give it a go.

01:10:21.472 --> 01:10:23.891
That was okay.

01:10:23.974 --> 01:10:26.018
A bit more.

01:11:22.366 --> 01:11:25.702
What's wrong?

01:11:25.786 --> 01:11:28.413
You used to love this.

01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:30.666
Yeah, I do.
I just-

01:11:35.963 --> 01:11:38.966
I just fall away
with it, you know.

01:11:41.385 --> 01:11:43.887
I just fall away.

01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:41.361
I told mom I had the loan.

01:12:41.445 --> 01:12:43.864
And I don't.

01:12:43.947 --> 01:12:46.742
Now the bank
will take me on.

01:12:46.825 --> 01:12:52.289
Ming thinks I'm turning up to the
restaurant on Monday with $40,000.

01:12:56.585 --> 01:12:59.922
I've done everything I can
and I just can't get it.

01:13:00.005 --> 01:13:01.298
How much have you got?

01:13:01.381 --> 01:13:02.633
Me?

01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:07.221
Have you got any money?

01:13:07.304 --> 01:13:11.266
Yeah.
$2,000.

01:13:17.523 --> 01:13:20.067
How much can you-

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:22.110
How much can you borrow
from the shop?

01:13:26.949 --> 01:13:30.744
We've got what, Friday?
Saturday, Sunday.

01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:39.753
You might be able to get near
if you had like ten or more.

01:13:39.837 --> 01:13:42.881
I could put it
into some sure markets.

01:13:44.424 --> 01:13:47.344
I make more than this
in a shorter time.

01:13:47.427 --> 01:13:50.556
People make thousands
and millions

01:13:50.597 --> 01:13:53.475
all over the world this way
every day.

01:13:55.477 --> 01:13:58.438
It's not easy
but it can be done.

01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:09.616
<i>What day Is It today?</i>

01:14:09.658 --> 01:14:11.285
<i>Today Is Monday,</i>

01:14:11.368 --> 01:14:14.454
"It's been a week
since you crashed,"

01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:18.083
<i>I cannot remember crashing,</i>

01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:23.255
"But I did have this-
this terrible nightmare,"

01:14:23.297 --> 01:14:24.423
Sorry.

01:15:05.797 --> 01:15:08.509
Hello, stranger.

01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:16.975
Thanks.

01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:20.354
This is, uh,
this is all you can get?

01:15:20.395 --> 01:15:22.356
Yeh.

01:15:24.483 --> 01:15:26.902
How many shops
you've got now?

01:15:26.985 --> 01:15:28.695
Just one.

01:15:30.364 --> 01:15:32.199
They used to be everywhere.

01:15:32.282 --> 01:15:33.283
Yeah.

01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:39.540
This is a good sport, ey?

01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:42.543
How long ago
did your mom die?

01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:45.879
Three years ago now.

01:15:45.921 --> 01:15:47.506
Must be worth a bit.

01:15:47.589 --> 01:15:49.049
Yeah, maybe.

01:15:49.132 --> 01:15:51.134
So, I don't know.
You can make it here

01:15:51.218 --> 01:15:55.472
say twice a week or so. I mean,
this is not going to last long.

01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:58.308
I put myself out enough
getting you there, alright?

01:15:58.392 --> 01:16:00.727
Yeah, sure.
Nice way.

01:16:01.854 --> 01:16:04.356
Why the fuck
did you call?

01:16:04.439 --> 01:16:06.567
You've got friends
in all places.

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:09.194
What about your boyfriend?
Your business partner.

01:16:09.236 --> 01:16:11.029
He'd be better placed
to help you.

01:16:11.071 --> 01:16:13.282
A business man, huh?

01:16:13.365 --> 01:16:15.701
What are you on about?

01:16:15.742 --> 01:16:18.412
I didn't know who Bradley
"the junkie" Thompson is.

01:16:21.415 --> 01:16:23.083
Yeah, he can't help me.

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:24.793
Are you kidding?

01:16:24.877 --> 01:16:28.589
No. He's closed up. He's
retired. He can't help me.

01:16:31.175 --> 01:16:33.927
Lionel, you've been talking
to him?

01:16:34.011 --> 01:16:36.597
Who have you been
talking to, ey?

01:16:36.638 --> 01:16:38.140
Steven Moss.

01:16:45.856 --> 01:16:48.192
Ray, what are you doing
with Moss?

01:16:54.615 --> 01:16:57.701
Little Ray.

01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:01.705
I won't ask you
to do this again.

01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:05.209
I gotta go.

01:17:30.442 --> 01:17:31.610
Can I help you?

01:17:31.693 --> 01:17:32.903
Is Jonny Nguyen here?

01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:34.112
Jonny-

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:36.156
N- g-u-y-e-n.

01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:39.660
Here's his card.
He gave me his card.

01:17:39.701 --> 01:17:41.870
Just a minute, please.

01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:57.010
Do you mind coming with me?
We can sort this out.

01:17:57.094 --> 01:17:58.929
Sort what out?

01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:01.598
Is he here or not?

01:18:01.682 --> 01:18:04.518
This is our company card
and this is a forgery.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.562
Jonny Nguyen
doesn't work here.

01:18:06.603 --> 01:18:09.022
If he's trading or doing
anything under our name

01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:12.234
it's quite serious.
Do you know this man?

01:18:12.317 --> 01:18:14.736
No.

01:18:15.612 --> 01:18:17.156
Excuse me!

01:18:43.515 --> 01:18:46.226
Trace!
Hi.

01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:50.647
They are my family.

01:18:50.731 --> 01:18:53.984
Everybody, do you remember
Tracy, Tracy Heart?

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:56.612
My uncle, June,

01:18:56.695 --> 01:18:59.781
You know my-
Her mom.

01:18:59.865 --> 01:19:02.576
Join us, please. Jonny's
first day at work today.

01:19:06.997 --> 01:19:08.832
What's happening?

01:19:15.797 --> 01:19:17.674
What's going on?

01:19:17.758 --> 01:19:19.134
No, everything's fine.

01:19:23.347 --> 01:19:24.348
Trace.

01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:25.933
Yes, I can.

01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:29.645
Trace!

01:19:29.728 --> 01:19:32.439
Don't grab me!

01:19:34.358 --> 01:19:35.359
Trace.

01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:37.027
Fuck off!

01:19:47.412 --> 01:19:48.747
Tracy!

01:19:48.789 --> 01:19:50.332
Fuck off.

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:52.918
Trace!

01:19:56.922 --> 01:19:58.382
Tracy!
Okay.

01:20:01.135 --> 01:20:03.679
Okay, alright!
Look, this is-

01:20:03.762 --> 01:20:07.432
Tracy, this is
- Tracy, I had to convince my uncle

01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:10.894
that I had this career.
That, that I was okay.

01:20:10.978 --> 01:20:14.148
I didn't send you away.
So, you made a shit, too?

01:20:14.231 --> 01:20:16.942
I didn't know anything was
going to happen between us!

01:20:17.025 --> 01:20:20.028
It doesn't matter!
This is all crap, all of this!

01:20:20.112 --> 01:20:23.657
Trace... will you fucking
look at me?

01:20:26.994 --> 01:20:29.997
What was this
about making $40,000?

01:20:31.123 --> 01:20:33.208
What was that?

01:20:35.586 --> 01:20:38.714
Ray and I have a trip to do
this weekend.

01:20:38.797 --> 01:20:41.216
I'll still get you
your money.

01:20:45.012 --> 01:20:46.847
Ray?

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:49.016
I can get it for you
by Monday.

01:20:49.099 --> 01:20:51.435
You can have
what you want.

01:20:51.518 --> 01:20:52.978
Ray?

01:20:54.062 --> 01:20:56.148
You and Ray?

01:20:59.568 --> 01:21:02.613
So, you're not a stockbroker.
You're still a drug dealer.

01:21:02.696 --> 01:21:04.865
Fuck!

01:21:11.872 --> 01:21:13.415
I'm sorry, Trace.

01:21:13.499 --> 01:21:16.210
I thought I could do
this for you

01:21:16.251 --> 01:21:18.545
and you wouldn't be involved.

01:21:23.926 --> 01:21:26.970
I am fucked!

01:21:27.054 --> 01:21:29.431
It's just this
one time for me.

01:21:31.391 --> 01:21:32.643
Look at me.

01:21:35.187 --> 01:21:37.940
We do this with Ray together.

01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:40.442
We can get
what we want.

01:21:59.586 --> 01:22:02.756
I can't get the loan, mom.

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:08.679
Does it mean no?

01:22:15.811 --> 01:22:18.772
Is it so bad? I mean,
you still got your job.

01:22:18.814 --> 01:22:22.860
You're the manager.
That's quite an achievement.

01:22:22.943 --> 01:22:25.070
I don't want
to just have a job!

01:22:25.112 --> 01:22:28.532
Four years I've been
working in that place!

01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:34.246
Turning up on time. Spending
hours chained up in there.

01:22:40.252 --> 01:22:42.629
What do you want, Tracy?

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:49.636
I wanna turn up on Monday

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.973
with enough cash to be
an owner of that business.

01:22:56.643 --> 01:22:57.895
What else?

01:23:03.108 --> 01:23:06.069
When Jonny was here
the other night,

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:10.032
shit, I gave him
a hard time.

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:13.327
And I thought to myself afterwards,
"Where did that come from?"

01:23:15.412 --> 01:23:18.957
I haven't seen you these last
few days since he's been back.

01:23:22.628 --> 01:23:25.088
Mom!

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:28.884
I see a bit
of my little girl back.

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:33.138
Yeah.

01:23:33.222 --> 01:23:35.599
Well, it's not that easy, mom.
I mean, you know.

01:23:37.392 --> 01:23:38.685
No, it's not.

01:23:49.321 --> 01:23:51.323
You would've done
something different

01:23:51.365 --> 01:23:53.700
if you could've,
wouldn't you?

01:23:55.285 --> 01:23:57.621
You would've changed
thing for you?

01:23:57.704 --> 01:23:59.832
Of course.

01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:07.714
Trace, it's your life.
Darling, it's no one else's.

01:24:48.213 --> 01:24:49.381
Got your card?

01:24:49.465 --> 01:24:51.049
Yeah.

01:24:55.971 --> 01:25:00.517
You've got $15 in overdue.
Do you want to fix it a month?

01:25:00.601 --> 01:25:03.228
Would you pay a couple
of dollars off it today?

01:25:04.396 --> 01:25:05.856
Alright.

01:25:05.939 --> 01:25:07.858
This guy
will fix it.

01:25:09.234 --> 01:25:10.277
Thanks for this.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.029
No worries
I need the money.

01:25:12.112 --> 01:25:13.530
How much is here?

01:25:13.614 --> 01:25:15.365
Eight.

01:25:16.492 --> 01:25:17.993
So, do you bring it back?

01:25:18.076 --> 01:25:19.786
Yeah, we got a buyer.

01:25:22.581 --> 01:25:23.790
How far out is it?

01:25:23.874 --> 01:25:26.877
A couple of hours.
South.

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.632
Okay, I'm coming with you.

01:25:33.467 --> 01:25:34.551
No, she's not.

01:25:38.388 --> 01:25:40.724
I go where that money goes.

01:25:40.808 --> 01:25:42.434
Fuck!

01:25:45.854 --> 01:25:49.483
"Okay, Tania, It's discussed
If we don't reach the reserve,"

01:25:49.566 --> 01:25:52.736
You talk to him.
You handle all the negotiations.

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.154
I can't go there today.

01:25:55.531 --> 01:25:58.367
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

01:25:59.785 --> 01:26:02.663
Oh, this is very exciting.

01:26:10.337 --> 01:26:13.090
Uh!

01:26:13.173 --> 01:26:14.675
What did you do that for?

01:26:14.758 --> 01:26:17.219
'Cause you're here
and you fucking shouldn't be.

01:26:17.302 --> 01:26:19.388
Fucking hurt my head.
Is it bleeding?

01:26:19.471 --> 01:26:22.599
Why are you in my house?

01:26:22.683 --> 01:26:24.143
It was a fucking shit week.

01:26:24.226 --> 01:26:27.229
I've heard from credible
sources that you aren't retiring.

01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:31.233
That makes you
a full blind prick, you know.

01:26:31.316 --> 01:26:32.693
Say it again.

01:26:32.776 --> 01:26:35.112
You heard me.

01:26:38.365 --> 01:26:43.829
Lionel, who told you
I wasn't retiring?

01:26:46.665 --> 01:26:49.168
You should talk
to Steven.

01:26:53.255 --> 01:26:54.965
Alright.

01:26:55.048 --> 01:26:58.635
Let's have a look at that.
That's alright.

01:26:58.719 --> 01:27:01.013
I kind of liked it.

01:27:21.742 --> 01:27:24.786
Come with me.
I'll sort you out.

01:28:05.452 --> 01:28:09.790
Steven, If I drive down
to my place at Milton,

01:28:09.873 --> 01:28:12.167
what am I gonna find there?

01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:14.294
Don't know. I haven't
been there in years.

01:28:14.378 --> 01:28:16.296
Well, they asked me.

01:28:16.338 --> 01:28:19.007
Hey, hello!
Long time.

01:28:19.091 --> 01:28:20.843
Hi, Jenny.

01:28:22.719 --> 01:28:24.012
Meet you at mom's?

01:28:24.096 --> 01:28:25.305
Yeah, it'll be alright.

01:28:25.389 --> 01:28:27.307
Hello, darling.

01:28:27.391 --> 01:28:28.892
I'll brush your hair.

01:28:28.976 --> 01:28:31.645
Good to see you, Brad.
Lionel.

01:28:34.148 --> 01:28:36.150
That stuff alone?

01:28:36.191 --> 01:28:38.235
Yeah, four, please.

01:28:40.154 --> 01:28:41.238
See ya.

01:28:41.321 --> 01:28:44.366
I own that place.
It's in my name.

01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:47.161
I know that. Look...you
believe this old junkie?

01:28:47.244 --> 01:28:48.579
This is what
he wanted.

01:28:48.662 --> 01:28:51.748
His name
is Lionel Dawson.

01:28:51.832 --> 01:28:54.543
He has done things
and been in situations

01:28:54.626 --> 01:28:56.461
you can only dream of.

01:28:56.545 --> 01:28:58.422
He's one of the greats,
you prick!

01:28:58.505 --> 01:29:01.008
Steven, c'mon!
Fuck.

01:29:02.342 --> 01:29:04.636
You can't smoke
in here, mate.

01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:16.773
This is nice, ey.

01:29:16.857 --> 01:29:18.192
Yes, it's very nice.

01:29:20.944 --> 01:29:24.990
Steven... I know
how much you earn.

01:29:25.073 --> 01:29:27.576
I know how much
your fucking mortgage is.

01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:29.953
You tell me everything,
you bloody idiot.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.624
This is all new!

01:29:35.042 --> 01:29:38.045
Lionel, wait in the car,
will you?

01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:44.593
Just tell me the truth.

01:29:44.676 --> 01:29:47.429
What have you been doing

01:29:47.513 --> 01:29:49.681
under my name
behind my fucking back?

01:29:52.976 --> 01:29:55.229
One finial call.

01:29:56.897 --> 01:30:00.025
I'll find out.

01:30:03.737 --> 01:30:06.406
He's the one you have
to worry about, Bradley.

01:30:08.242 --> 01:30:10.410

this terror,

01:30:14.206 --> 01:30:15.707

01:30:19.086 --> 01:30:21.588
You're in trouble now.

01:30:22.589 --> 01:30:25.092
I can smell it
coming off you.

01:30:29.847 --> 01:30:31.390
Will you drive, Lionel?

01:30:31.431 --> 01:30:33.058
Alright.

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.643
Drive the car.

01:30:34.726 --> 01:30:35.727
Yeah, sure.

01:30:35.769 --> 01:30:37.521
I'm gonna fucking
sort this out.

01:30:37.604 --> 01:30:39.898
I need some information.

01:30:53.662 --> 01:30:56.957
<i>Lionel, are you there?</i>

01:31:18.061 --> 01:31:19.855
These are okay?

01:31:19.938 --> 01:31:21.648
Ey?

01:31:25.986 --> 01:31:27.112
Thanks.

01:31:45.214 --> 01:31:46.882
What's going on there?

01:31:50.677 --> 01:31:51.887
C'mon, Trace.

01:31:54.056 --> 01:31:56.225
You know how to love
someone.

01:31:56.308 --> 01:31:57.726
Just fucking dive in.

01:32:46.108 --> 01:32:48.068
What put you down
with the place, Brad?

01:32:50.154 --> 01:32:53.282
Steven fucking Moss.
That fuck.

01:32:56.618 --> 01:32:59.454
I fucking warned him.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.333
Come on.

01:33:03.417 --> 01:33:06.086
A cup of tea, ey?

01:33:08.422 --> 01:33:10.757
I'd like
just to clear that quickly.

01:33:10.841 --> 01:33:13.343
We passed him
on the road.

01:33:15.721 --> 01:33:16.930
What's wrong with you?

01:33:17.014 --> 01:33:19.099
Nothing.

01:33:19.183 --> 01:33:20.934
What about that shit
I got you?

01:33:23.353 --> 01:33:25.147
I'm not gonna get on.

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:34.740
Maybe when I'm clean
we can build a house here, ey?

01:33:34.781 --> 01:33:38.785
Lionel is a fuck physique.

01:33:38.869 --> 01:33:41.371
Yeah, but you know
what you said to Steven.

01:33:41.455 --> 01:33:44.041
Like you said
I've been in situations.

01:33:45.042 --> 01:33:47.961
You know,
you said I was great.

01:33:50.297 --> 01:33:53.342
I love you, Brad.
I miss you.

01:33:54.384 --> 01:33:57.262
Anything you ever loved
is this.

01:33:57.304 --> 01:34:00.224
That's not the fucking true.

01:34:00.307 --> 01:34:02.267
Listen to me, Lionel,

01:34:05.062 --> 01:34:07.856
it's this Ray Heart.
Do you know him?

01:34:08.982 --> 01:34:10.567
No, no.

01:34:10.651 --> 01:34:12.694
How much is the truth?

01:34:14.988 --> 01:34:16.782
I don't know him, seriously.

01:34:16.865 --> 01:34:18.867
You're a fucking liar.

01:34:18.951 --> 01:34:20.160
That's not true.

01:34:23.163 --> 01:34:24.998
Don't.

01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:28.377
Not you, Brad.
Please.

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.754
There are things
I can explain.

01:34:30.838 --> 01:34:34.049
You are a fucking
lying junkie cunt.

01:34:36.093 --> 01:34:37.928
You've caused me nothing
but trouble.

01:34:38.011 --> 01:34:39.680
Don't be hard
with me.

01:34:39.763 --> 01:34:41.932
Fuck.

01:34:42.015 --> 01:34:45.185
It's over, Lionel.
It's fucking over.

01:34:48.564 --> 01:34:50.732
You stay there.

01:34:53.485 --> 01:34:55.737
Don't come
anywhere near me.

01:35:04.705 --> 01:35:06.665
Just sit there.

01:35:13.255 --> 01:35:15.466
I'm tired.

01:35:16.341 --> 01:35:18.969
Just stay there, Lionel.

01:35:19.052 --> 01:35:21.138
Yeah, okay, Brad.

01:36:20.447 --> 01:36:22.491
Straight up here

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.427

01:36:42.511 --> 01:36:44.471

01:37:00.195 --> 01:37:02.364
It's black here.

01:37:09.746 --> 01:37:11.623
Alright.

Are you gonna kill us?

01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.857
You'll have to kill
all of us.

01:43:12.025 --> 01:43:14.278
Otherwise you fucked your life.

01:43:14.361 --> 01:43:17.239
