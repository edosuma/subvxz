00:01.359 --> 00:03.360
Last week on St Elsewhere:

00:03.360 --> 00:07.080
This is my wife! If you want me
out of this room, arrest me again!

00:07.080 --> 00:09.840
Joan Halloran, the new city
Health Services Advisor.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.880
What are you doing in here
without scrubs on?

00:11.880 --> 00:14.600
What are you doing in here
without scrubs on?

00:14.600 --> 00:16.640
Don't be silly. If there's a problem,

00:16.640 --> 00:18.800
the best solution
is for us to find out.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.440
I've only got two options.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.040
I can let her die
or do a heart transplant.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.680
Tonight on St Elsewhere:

00:24.680 --> 00:28.680
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star. #

00:30.360 --> 00:34.240
Ehrlich, I am not choosing a resident
for this transplant on his ability

00:34.240 --> 00:36.240
to stand around looking stupid!

00:36.240 --> 00:39.720
You don't know who Dr Caldwell is?

00:39.720 --> 00:41.280
Why, these are great hands
for a plastic surgeon.

00:41.280 --> 00:44.120
Why, these are great hands
for a plastic surgeon.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.360
You know, getting kicked out
of a residency

00:46.360 --> 00:48.960
is a pretty high price
for a doctor to pay these days.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.000
As far as I'm concerned,
you got what you paid for.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.520
Jesus!

00:54.520 --> 00:58.520
Honey?

02:38.240 --> 02:41.680
'Elliot, where are you?'

02:41.680 --> 02:44.120
Elliot? Elliot.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.120
Yes, sir?

02:45.120 --> 02:46.680
Yes, sir?

02:46.680 --> 02:49.120
What are you doing in there?
Dissecting her?

02:49.120 --> 02:50.400
Well, no.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.360
Actually, I misplaced
my stethoscope.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.440
Actually, I misplaced
my stethoscope.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.440
You've got to be thorough
but fast. Follow me.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.360
This is Mr Yates.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.640
He sprinkled his cornflakes
with angel dust this morning.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.280
So hurry up with bed one
and he's all yours.

03:07.280 --> 03:11.000
Is there anything I should, like,
concentrate on during the exam?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
No, we don't know anything about him.
Do a full exam and report back to me.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.800
(INTERCOM) 'Mr Rennelli
to physical therapy.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.520
'Mr J Rennelli
to physical therapy.'

03:22.520 --> 03:24.800
Wow, did you pass
your driving test

03:24.800 --> 03:26.520
or did they flunk you for the good
of the Commonwealth?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.080
or did they flunk you for the good
of the Commonwealth?

03:28.080 --> 03:31.040
Found this great doughnut shop
next door. Cute waitress, too.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.960
You're supposed
to be here 30 minutes ago.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.120
I have 12 patients to see before
rounds. Have a little consideration.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.560
If you look in the on-call room,

03:37.560 --> 03:40.720
there's a bag with two delicious
crawlers in it just for you.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.560
I don't forget who
my friends are, OK?

03:42.560 --> 03:45.000
OK. Do you need any help with her,
otherwise I'm going to go?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.400
No, I'm going to go to
x-ray and call plastics.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.480
Wait a minute. Don't tell me Wayne
The Insane is chickening out?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.360
You know I'd love to sew it up,

03:52.360 --> 03:55.240
but she's young, she's a girl,
it's her face. You know.

03:55.240 --> 03:59.240
Besides, I can always
inflict myself upon her later.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.360
Dr Eric. &gt;

04:00.360 --> 04:01.400
Dr Eric. &gt;

04:01.400 --> 04:03.080
Victor, yes.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.960
Mr Yates, on that full exam...

04:05.960 --> 04:08.160
Er, do I have to do a rectal?

04:08.160 --> 04:10.320
Yes, Elliot.
Everyone gets a rectal.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.600
OK, I'll remember that.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.880
Good.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.880
Elliot, when you do the
rectal, use a glove.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.920
I guess it's too late
to go to law school, huh?

04:19.920 --> 04:23.920
I guess it's too late
to go to law school, huh?

(INTERCOM) 'Nurse Daniels
to nurse's station four west.'

04:28.080 --> 04:29.200
Dr Westphall.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.800
Hello, Barry.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.200
Hi. Lisa told me where I could
find you. May I walk with you?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.840
Hi. Lisa told me where I could
find you. May I walk with you?

04:34.840 --> 04:37.680
I've been thinking a lot
these last two weeks

04:37.680 --> 04:40.720
about my dismissal from
the residency programme.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.520
And I've decided to appeal my case.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.120
What do you think about that?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.360
Well, you're certainly
entitled to an appeal.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.400
I thought I'd get one or two people

04:50.400 --> 04:54.160
to change their valuations,
like Dr Cavanero, for example.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.840
Do you think that would help?

04:55.840 --> 04:57.120
Really can't say, Barry.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.920
You know, your evaluation
was based on an entire year,

04:59.920 --> 05:01.040
not just one or two rotations.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.920
not just one or two rotations.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.520
Dr Cavanero really
came down hard on me.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.040
If I can get her to change
her evaluation,

05:08.040 --> 05:10.360
the review committee
might reconsider its vote.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.560
Maybe, but in the meantime,
you ought to look

05:12.560 --> 05:14.320
for another residency programme.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.120
I'm still willing
to help you, Barry.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.440
The longer you put it off,
the tougher it's going to be.

05:18.440 --> 05:22.240
With all due respect, Dr Westphall,
I appreciate your offer.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.080
But if there's any chance at all,

05:24.080 --> 05:27.960
I'd like a certificate of residency
from St Eligius on my record.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.520
Nobody can blame you for that.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.800
Thanks a lot. I'll let
you know how it goes.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.800
OK.

Hello, Dr Morrison.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.440
Morning. Is the singing helping?

06:03.440 --> 06:04.720
Yeah, it was a good idea.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.360
Her pronunciation's getting better
and her voice is getting stronger.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.720

and her voice is getting stronger.

(TRIES TO SPEAK)

06:18.840 --> 06:21.600

06:21.600 --> 06:24.360
How come?

06:24.360 --> 06:28.360
Singing

06:29.400 --> 06:32.080
Can you squeeze my fingers?

06:32.080 --> 06:36.080
How about this one?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.800
Not yet?

06:38.800 --> 06:40.320
It's OK.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.720
How about your feet?

06:41.720 --> 06:44.200
We've been working on that.
They're getting stronger.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.240
Can you move it from me?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.360
Huh? Come on.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.920
A little bit.

06:51.920 --> 06:55.920
That's OK. That's good.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
Your progress is amazing.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.400
A...maz...ing.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.800
You ought to get another CATscan,
doctor, see if the swelling around
the brain has gone down.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.080
You sound more and more
like a neurologist.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.000
You haven't been
out of this room in a week.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.680
Don't you want to take a walk around
the block or something?

07:14.680 --> 07:15.720
Don't you want to take a walk around
the block or something?

07:15.720 --> 07:19.040
When she walks out of here, I walk
out of here. Right, honey?

07:19.040 --> 07:22.280
(MISPRONOUNCES "RIGHT")

07:22.280 --> 07:24.360
Right. Right!

07:24.360 --> 07:27.000
Right.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.440
That's better.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.720
What else is on
the programme, doctor?

07:31.720 --> 07:32.880
Well, in a few minutes,

07:32.880 --> 07:36.240
you've both got a meeting with Dr
Condon from occupational therapy.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.440
Then we'll send you down
to physical therapy

07:38.440 --> 07:39.840
to improve on your motor skills.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.840
And what do I do then?

07:41.840 --> 07:44.360
Well, there's a meeting for
stroke patient families at 11.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.760
It's about the kinds of things you'll
need to have once Fran goes home.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.440
It's about the kinds of things you'll
need to have once Fran goes home.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.880
You can't see her until tomorrow.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.760
You can't see her until tomorrow.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.040
Mr Singleton,
that's enough for one day.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.160
Listen, the sooner she's better,
the sooner I'm out of your hair.

07:57.160 --> 08:01.160
Can you believe this guy?

08:01.920 --> 08:04.840
I...

08:04.840 --> 08:07.120
..like...

08:07.120 --> 08:09.400
him.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.320
Me too.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.720
See you later.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.560
OK.

Mr Sirkin.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.919
I'm going for my X-ray now.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.640
Good. Strictly routine.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.400
We get them from all bypass patients
before they go home.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.640
I expect to release you
tomorrow as planned.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.760
Sounds fine to me.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.440
Who has Mr Sirkin?

08:51.440 --> 08:52.600
I do, sir.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.880
What was his body fluid this morning?

08:54.880 --> 08:56.360
Um, I don't know, sir.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.560
Why not?

08:57.560 --> 09:00.760
I was helping in the ER and I didn't
have a chance to see his chart.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.320
Were his lungs clearer?

09:03.320 --> 09:05.960
I don't know. I didn't get
to examine him either.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.880
I suppose as
he's going home tomorrow,

09:07.880 --> 09:09.560
there's no need
to check on him today?

09:09.560 --> 09:10.720
there's no need
to check on him today?

09:10.720 --> 09:14.720
Next time, see your patients before
rounds, or don't bother to show up.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.960

09:25.120 --> 09:27.480

for a wound check

and not to wash it until then.

we called for reinforcements.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.880
Yeah, the alignment's
almost perfect.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.240
What do you mean almost?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.040
Do you always use interrupteds?

09:43.040 --> 09:46.280
Yeah. I think if you use continuous
sutures, you get in more trouble.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.640
Of course, plenty of people
would probably say,

09:48.640 --> 09:49.640
"What the hell does he know?"

09:49.640 --> 09:50.840
"What the hell does he know?"

09:50.840 --> 09:53.080
Now you've seen me do one,
you can do the next.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.400
I wish. I love plastics,
I just don't have the hands for it.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.800
Let me see those.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.720
Why, those are great hands
for a plastic surgeon.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.040
God!

10:04.040 --> 10:07.880
My best friend from residency used
that line to propose to his wife.

10:07.880 --> 10:08.960
I do, I do!

10:08.960 --> 10:11.920
Excuse me, but the mother
wants to know your name.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.120
Sure. It's Dr Caldwell.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.360
C-A-L-D-W-E-L-L.

10:16.360 --> 10:20.120

and then it's, uh... Fiscus.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.400
Good work, guys.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.760
Thanks.  Come again.

10:23.760 --> 10:27.080
Great hands(!)
Is that corny or is that corny?

10:27.080 --> 10:31.080
You should be so corny!

10:33.280 --> 10:36.880
Man, my feet. I've got to sit.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.080
What's your problem?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.600
I need to go to the bathroom.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.520
How come women have so much trouble
controlling their bladders?

10:42.520 --> 10:45.280
There's something pressing
down called the uterus.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.120
Maybe you've heard of it(?)

10:46.120 --> 10:47.840
Maybe you've heard of it(?)

10:47.840 --> 10:51.840
Shirley was right.
You're a pig, Ehrlich.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.880
So there's really
nothing more we can do

10:57.880 --> 11:00.400
in terms of just
giving you medicine, Eve.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.720
What you need is a new heart muscle,

11:02.720 --> 11:05.000
a new pump.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.280
In other words, a new heart.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.720
The old one still has
its good points.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.080
You can trust
they won't be disturbed.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.400
What are my chances
of surviving the surgery?

11:16.400 --> 11:19.720
Very good. You have two
important things in your favour.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.560
One is that, other than your heart,
you're basically in good shape.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.720
Second, you're relatively young.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.240
Isn't he charming?

11:28.240 --> 11:31.040
When you talk like that,
you know my heart is yours.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.280
I guess we really
don't have much choice.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.760
You always have a choice.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.360
Now, do you want more time to
think about things?

11:39.360 --> 11:41.080
No, let's do it.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.600
The sooner the better.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.040
OK. I'm going to want
some other doctors to see you,

11:46.040 --> 11:49.360
just to make sure you're in the best
possible shape for the operation.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.760
I also want to move you
to a special sterilised room

11:51.760 --> 11:54.360
to minimise the chance of you
picking up an infection.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.640
With my luck,
I'll get the transplant,

11:56.640 --> 11:59.080
walk outside
and get hit by an ambulance.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.120
Eve...

12:02.120 --> 12:04.840
We've been here far too long.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.920
I think my feet are numb.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.320
This is ridiculous.
After four hours of rounds?

12:10.320 --> 12:12.720
This has nothing to do
with medicine, nothing.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.720
I can't hold it any longer.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.120
Sorry, sir, my feet hurt.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.440
Oh, I see. Your feet hurt.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.640
I suppose if you become a surgeon,
you'll tell all your patients

12:23.640 --> 12:25.920
to expect you to sit down
during their surgery

12:25.920 --> 12:27.240
whenever your feet hurt.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.800
No, sir.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.560
Ehrlich, do you know the utility room
on the surgical floor?

12:31.560 --> 12:32.600
Ehrlich, do you know the utility room
on the surgical floor?

12:32.600 --> 12:33.920
There is a chair in there.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.880
Before I do this heart transplant,
I want you sitting in it,

12:36.880 --> 12:38.840
because I don't want to be distracted

12:38.840 --> 12:41.760
by the thought that your feet
might hurt. Is that clear?

12:41.760 --> 12:43.680
Yes, sir.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.560
Kiley, I want a full copy of
tissue typing on my desk in an hour.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.040
Yes, sir.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.320
Yes, sir.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.760
Wade, talk to Dietary. Find out every
meal they plan to give Mrs Leighton.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.000
Where the hell is Jacobson?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.120
Where the hell is Jacobson?

12:56.120 --> 12:58.440
What are you standing
around for? Let's go!

12:58.440 --> 12:59.560
Ehrlich.  Yes.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.480
Go down to cardiology,
bring me all her angiograms,

13:02.480 --> 13:06.480
if you think you can handle that.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.440
MONITOR BEEPS

13:11.440 --> 13:13.160
What's the BP?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.760
Still holding around 95.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.680
Dr Cavanero?

13:17.680 --> 13:20.800
Let's send him to ICU
and put in a chest tube.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.360
OK. I'll get a bed.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.840
I'll get it.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.800
How have you been, Barry?

13:27.800 --> 13:31.000
Not so good.
But I'm appealing my dismissal

13:31.000 --> 13:33.480
and I wanted to talk to you
about my gastro evaluation...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.200
and I wanted to talk to you
about my gastro evaluation...

13:35.200 --> 13:38.600
but I don't think I said anything
in your evaluation that was unfair.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.560
You weren't unfair, but some
of what you said was harsh.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.840
Barry, I don't...

13:42.840 --> 13:46.840
Do you think we could talk a little
later? It's very important to me.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.720
All right.

13:48.720 --> 13:49.840
After lunch.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.000
Thanks.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.240
Thanks very much.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.760
So, in the last two weekends
of the city health awareness Expo,

13:57.760 --> 13:59.720
you'll be there both Saturdays 8-4

13:59.720 --> 14:01.960
and then noon to 3
on the closing Sunday.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.720
I said I'd do it.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.920
You heard him.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.400
Is that all?

14:07.400 --> 14:09.040
I think so.

14:09.040 --> 14:13.040
Oh, that television interview about
the transplant is tonight at 10.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.760
Tonight?!

14:14.760 --> 14:17.360
I told you it would be
some time this week.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.840
How about a little notice,
for Pete's sake?

14:19.840 --> 14:22.400
I just got the patient
to sign a consent form!

14:22.400 --> 14:25.400
My understanding is you have
to be ready to operate at any time,

14:25.400 --> 14:27.960
as soon as a heart is available,
right? I mean, any minute.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.800
At any second.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.440
Seems to me anyone who can perform
open-heart surgery

14:33.440 --> 14:36.720
on a moment's notice can certainly
answer a few questions

14:36.720 --> 14:37.960
on a local newscast.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.880
Certainly.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.560
Good.

14:41.560 --> 14:45.440
Well, I think
that takes care of everything.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.800
Don't forget our meeting about
the outpatient surgery clinic later.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.480
How could I?

14:50.480 --> 14:52.160
Have a nice day.

14:52.160 --> 14:56.160
You too.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.960
It's women like that that give
the X chromosome a bad name.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Come on, one more time.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.120
Hard...

15:05.120 --> 15:08.400
I know it's hard. Raise your leg
one more time. One last time.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.800
Come on. Push it!

15:11.800 --> 15:13.000
Much.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.400
No, it's not too much.
Push it, sweetie, push!

15:15.400 --> 15:18.440
Raise your leg. Come on.
Get it off the bed.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.360
Up, up, up!

15:20.360 --> 15:21.520
You can do it. Up!

15:21.520 --> 15:23.920
Push it. Hit my hand. Hit my hand.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.240
There you go, terrific!

15:25.240 --> 15:27.800
Terrific.
You'll be walking by tomorrow.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.240
Lunch.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.840
Ah, about time you got here.

15:30.840 --> 15:34.840
I'm sorry. When shift changes around
here, things get so screwed up.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.920
Yeah? I thought you people would've
worked that out by now.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.880
I run a business, certainly
not as crucial as what you people do

15:40.880 --> 15:43.400
and I don't have any trouble
with lateness.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.960
Jerry, please...

15:44.960 --> 15:48.200
You can go now. I
can take care of this.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.920
Mmm! Looks good.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.840
What do you want
to start with, honey?

15:52.840 --> 15:54.000
Milk.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.280
Milk? OK.

15:57.280 --> 16:01.280
Go get it.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.960
Come on.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.960
Jer...

16:09.960 --> 16:13.160
You can do it.

16:13.160 --> 16:17.160
Doesn't help if I get it for you.
Come on.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.000
Good, good. Open your fingers.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.040
Open them, open them, open them!

16:25.040 --> 16:29.040
There you go. That's it. Good.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.040
You got it, you got it.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.120
Terrific. Terrific!

16:34.120 --> 16:35.520
There you go.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.040
Good girl, good girl.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.560
Hey!

16:39.560 --> 16:43.560
(LAUGHS)

16:50.000 --> 16:51.640
Helen. Make sure everyone knows

16:51.640 --> 16:55.160
Mrs Leighton's room is under full
isolation precautions, and if...

16:55.160 --> 16:57.640
Yes, I know.
If there are any problems at all,

16:57.640 --> 16:59.040
call you immediately.

16:59.040 --> 17:03.040
Right.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.079
Mark?

17:07.079 --> 17:09.839
Does Mrs Leighton really need
to be in isolation?

17:09.839 --> 17:12.720
She's a compromised host.
She's had a temperature spike.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.319
Any infection would delay surgery.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.680
If I get a heart, I want my patient
to be as ready as I am.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.960
I think you're putting both of you
under tremendous pressure.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.520
Daniel, I'm a surgeon.
I thrive on pressure.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.880
If you'd like to take your mind
off things for a while,

17:24.880 --> 17:26.359
I've got a court reserved at six.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.000
Can't. I've got this meeting
with that Halloran woman.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.400
She wants to close
the outpatient surgical clinic.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.360
I've got to be there
to put up a stink.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.520
Why not get somebody
to take your place?

17:35.520 --> 17:37.120
With your transplant preparations

17:37.120 --> 17:39.560
and the interview tonight,
you've got enough to concern you.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.640
and the interview tonight,
you've got enough to concern you.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.320
Isn't there some young surgeon

17:42.320 --> 17:45.360
eager to make his way
into the world of hospital politics

17:45.360 --> 17:47.880
while we engage in combat
on the tennis court?

17:47.880 --> 17:51.320
You still play singles, don't you?

17:51.320 --> 17:55.320
You haven't got a prayer.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.840
Dr Craig here.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.840
Get me Dr Robert Caldwell.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.440
Hi.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.760
Hi.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.080
Well, how did it go?

18:20.080 --> 18:22.560
Not so good.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.040
Westphall was friendly,
but noncommittal

18:26.040 --> 18:28.880
and it was all I could do to get
Cavanero to agree to meet with me,

18:28.880 --> 18:30.680
let alone change her recommendation.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.280
Yeah, well,
she can be pretty inflexible.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.920
Inflexible? She wouldn't breathe

18:35.920 --> 18:39.920
if there was a rule against it
in the residents' handbook.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.680
You know, even if
she changes her mind,

18:42.680 --> 18:46.680
it may not help.
I mean, she is only one vote.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.320
Maybe you should forget
about St Eligius.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.160
Try for a fresh start someplace else.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.680
Where? What country?

18:54.680 --> 18:56.000
If they kick me out of here,

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm going to have a real rough time
getting another internship.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.760
Cavanero's my last shot.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.400
Barry, I don't know what to tell you.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.400
Listen, I know
I did a lousy job in her service

19:08.600 --> 19:11.480
but I was under tremendous pressure.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.880
You know that.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.440
Yeah, you were in pretty rough shape

19:15.440 --> 19:19.440
but nobody can abuse themselves
the way you did and not have it show.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.560
What can I do to help?

19:23.560 --> 19:25.760
You can talk to Cavanero
and explain things.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.760
At least if it's coming from you, it
won't sound like a bunch of excuses.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.360
OK, I'll do what I can.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.600
Thanks.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.520
I'm not as good as straightening out
administrative affairs

19:39.520 --> 19:41.240
as I am at straightening out noses.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.920
I didn't bring you to St Eligius
just to do facelifts

19:43.920 --> 19:46.040
and ski Vermont on the weekend.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.120
The sooner you get your feet wet,
the better.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.200
Here I am.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.480
Don't get up. You said
this would only take a minute.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.280
I wanted you to meet Dr Caldwell here

19:53.280 --> 19:55.560
since he'll be taking my place
at the meeting.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.000
Dr Caldwell, Joan Halloran.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.080
Hello.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.760
Robert, hello.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.800
I saw your picture
in the hospital news.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.320
Oh, they just did that
because I'm new here.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.400
How did I look?

20:05.400 --> 20:07.360
Oh, fine.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.440
Dr Caldwell is our
newest plastic surgeon.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.480
I personally brought him here
from Duke.

20:11.480 --> 20:15.000
&lt; Miss Halloran is the city
health services advisor.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.440
She's involved in funding
the outpatients clinics

20:17.440 --> 20:20.120
so she knows all there is to
know about plastic surgery.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.840
All I know is, we're spending
too much money down there.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.320
In case you haven't guessed,

20:25.320 --> 20:27.840
this meeting is supposed to be
a confrontation.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.960
I warned you.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.040
How about it, Miss Halloran?
Let's settle it right here.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.400
Best two out of three falls.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.920
Well, I'm afraid
you're out of my weight class.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.880
Nice to meet you.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.880
It was nice to meet you.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.040
There you go.

20:44.040 --> 20:48.040
Thank you.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.080
(LAUGHS)

20:52.080 --> 20:54.400
That line about
two out of three falls,

20:54.400 --> 20:57.160
I could barely keep a straight face.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.800
I think you're going to cut
that woman down to size.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.000
Any last-minute advice?

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
It's going to get nasty.
Wear a protective cup.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.840
I like the technical aspects
of surgery

21:08.840 --> 21:11.480
but this competitive atmosphere,
it's just not for me

21:11.480 --> 21:14.880
and it's ten times worse
with this transplant.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.320
Heard you got killed during rounds.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.200
What are you doing now,
Ms Bladder? Public broadcasting?

21:20.200 --> 21:21.760
I was late because of you, Fiscus.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.760
I'm sorry. Why not go up to
paediatrics and punch out a few kids?

21:24.760 --> 21:26.680
Thanks for the suggestion.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.520
Victor, you take things so seriously.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.760
Big deal if you don't get
to do the heart transplant.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.160
What's the worst that can happen?

21:32.160 --> 21:34.600
What's the worst that can happen?

21:34.600 --> 21:36.880
I'll be so upset
my work will deteriorate.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.760
I'll get thrown out of the residency

21:38.760 --> 21:41.840
and I'll wind up in some diet clinic
passing out amphetamines.

21:41.840 --> 21:45.840
But at least we'll always have Paris.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.640
How's it look?

21:57.640 --> 21:59.960
He's got a little subcutaneous air,
which is OK,

21:59.960 --> 22:01.800
but look at all that tumour.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.440
Oh. What about the tube?

22:04.440 --> 22:08.160
The tube's all right.
Unfortunately, the patient isn't.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.080
He's probably going to die
tonight, Phil.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.920
We shouldn't have
transferred him to ICU.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.200
We should have left him on the floor
and...let him go.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.760
It's bad form to let your patient
die of a pneumothorax.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.960
All right. Hi, Wendy.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.800
Phil. Annie, can I talk to you?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.640
Sure.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.640
Oh.

22:32.680 --> 22:36.680
Um, listen... Barry Dorn
spoke to me this morning.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.200
You too?

22:40.200 --> 22:42.560
I'm sure you evaluated him fairly.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.480
There were other things happening
while he was on your service

22:45.480 --> 22:46.960
and I thought you should know.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.920
I can't imagine.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.800
A girl he was going with
had a nervous breakdown.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.560
A girl? He went through
half the Gastro floor.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.000
In fact, I was doing endoscopy
when the lab-tec and the secretary

22:59.000 --> 23:01.440
discovered he was sleeping
with both of them.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.640
Listen, Annie, all I'm saying is that
his work may not have been up to par

23:04.640 --> 23:06.440
because he was under
a lot of pressure.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.560
Well, it was all self-inflicted.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.880
People make mistakes.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.880
When it comes to being a doctor,
there's no room for his kind

23:12.880 --> 23:16.200
of mistakes. His exams were sloppy,
his orders were haphazard.

23:16.200 --> 23:19.560
His attendance at lectures was
atrocious. Everybody knows that.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.960
Why do you have to be such
a hard-ass?

23:20.960 --> 23:23.320
Why do you have to be such
a hard-ass?

23:23.320 --> 23:27.320
The only reason you're defending
Barry is because you slept with him.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.160
I resent that!

23:29.160 --> 23:30.480
What I meant was...

23:30.480 --> 23:34.480
What I meant was...

23:55.280 --> 23:57.880
What you put me through,
Frannie! What you put me through!

23:57.880 --> 24:01.880
A guy like me,
buying fashion magazines!

24:02.120 --> 24:04.360
You're doing it all wrong.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.200
Hi, Dad.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.360
It's too slow, it's too slow.
Your mother's way past that point.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.440
Dad, she's tired.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.080
I know she's tired. We're all tired.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.280
Like this. If you're going
to do it, do it right.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.680
You know, nothing ever
changes you. Not even this.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.760
You've been negative about your
mother's recovery since the word go.

24:18.760 --> 24:19.800
You've been negative about your
mother's recovery since the word go.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.640
What's the problem, here?

24:20.640 --> 24:22.040
What's the problem, here?

24:22.040 --> 24:23.520
You're negative, you're arrogant,
and you're selfish!

24:23.520 --> 24:25.360
You're negative, you're arrogant,
and you're selfish!

24:25.360 --> 24:26.440
Get out of here,
mind your own business!

24:26.440 --> 24:30.440
Get out of here,
mind your own business!

24:36.680 --> 24:37.600
Hey, I didn't even do anything!

24:37.600 --> 24:39.960
Hey, I didn't even do anything!

24:39.960 --> 24:41.760
It's had the same effect
on your father, emotionally.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.800
Dr Morrison, if you buy that line,

24:43.800 --> 24:45.280
then he's really got you snowed.

24:45.280 --> 24:48.120
The only thing he cares about is
being the centre of attention.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.520
If my mother just happens to get
better, that's OK too.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.360
All I care about is
your mother getting better.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.080
I know your father's difficult,
but that's because he cares.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.600
If you can't keep
from fighting with him,

24:58.600 --> 25:00.720
don't come to the hospital
when he's here.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.000
Fine.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.600
OK!

25:05.600 --> 25:09.600
Oh, you think she's a finicky eater?

25:10.160 --> 25:13.760
I realise that you dieticians
spend a whole two or three months

25:13.760 --> 25:16.400
studying the science of eating.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.400
But Eve Leighton has
to be well nourished

25:18.400 --> 25:20.280
at the time of her transplant.

25:20.280 --> 25:24.280
What? Cater the food in
from Locke-Ober's!

25:24.400 --> 25:26.720
This is one patient that's
going into surgery

25:26.720 --> 25:30.720
in positive nitrogen balance.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.760
Ehrlich, what is this?

25:31.760 --> 25:34.480
Ehrlich, what is this?

25:34.480 --> 25:36.520
I asked you to bring me her films,

25:36.520 --> 25:38.840
not the entire
cardiology department!

25:38.840 --> 25:41.400
Well, I know that, sir.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.080
But they were on the machine
and I couldn't get them off.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.520
So I brought the whole thing.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.400
Ehrlich, I am not choosing a
resident for this transplant

25:48.400 --> 25:50.800
on his ability to stand around
looking stupid!

25:50.800 --> 25:52.160
KNOCKING ON DOOR

25:52.160 --> 25:54.560
KNOCKING ON DOOR

25:54.560 --> 25:58.560
Mrs Leighton's tissue typing, sir.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.880
Ehrlich, don't you know
how to do this?

26:03.880 --> 26:07.880
&lt; May I help, sir?

26:21.800 --> 26:25.800
I have been a boxer, a soldier
and a heart surgeon, Ehrlich

26:26.160 --> 26:30.160
I have managed to conquer
most of life's most dreaded fears.

26:30.320 --> 26:33.920
But the thought that one day,
some unsuspecting person

26:33.920 --> 26:37.360
may actually put his
life in your hands.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.360
really squeezes my adrenals.

26:42.080 --> 26:46.080
Yes, sir.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.200
Would you be careful, please?

26:51.200 --> 26:52.480
Treacherous things, those pails.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.120
Treacherous things, those pails.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.640
I was number one in my class.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.400
I got THE highest score
in the surgery section of the boards.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.400
I spent hours sewing chicken breasts
together, perfecting my knots.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.920
My hands still smell like chicken!

27:03.920 --> 27:05.680
My hands still smell like chicken!

27:05.680 --> 27:08.640
Listen, I didn't have time to
learn about audiovisual aids.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.720
In fact, I can't stand
audiovisual aids.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.640
Since high school,
I've despised kids

27:12.640 --> 27:14.960
who worked for extra credit,
with their mindless smiles

27:14.960 --> 27:16.520
and keys dangling on their belts.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.120
Now it's all come back to haunt me.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.520
Instead of assisting
Dr Craig in the transplant,

27:20.520 --> 27:22.320
I'm going to be changing
a colostomy bag.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.360
All because I couldn't
thread the projector!

27:24.360 --> 27:27.360
And you know something? It's not
fair! Am I right or am I wrong?

27:27.360 --> 27:29.920
Undoubtedly.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.640
Really? Do you really mean that?

27:31.640 --> 27:33.760
Absolutely.

27:33.760 --> 27:37.240
That's fantastic. I appreciate that.
I was thinking nobody understood me.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.480
I was all crazy, here in my
little cosmic crisis.

27:39.480 --> 27:43.480
And then you came along.
Thanks, Dr Auschlander.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.560
Do you think your
evaluation was fair?

27:54.920 --> 27:57.040
It ticked me off, the way
he let his personal life

27:57.040 --> 28:01.040
interfere with his profession.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.280
You know, when I was in med school,

28:04.280 --> 28:06.800
the chief of surgery, Ernest
Rockenmier,

28:06.800 --> 28:09.880
accused me of the very same thing.
He was a terror, this guy.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.680
He used to hold these vicious
interrogations, you know?

28:12.680 --> 28:16.080
If you got any questions wrong,
he really came down hard on you.

28:16.080 --> 28:19.320
If you got them all right,
he'd make you take call.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.000
What a nice reward(!)

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
Which he offered me the night I
decided to ask my wife to marry me.

28:25.080 --> 28:29.080
Just as he was writing my name
on the call schedule I said,

28:29.120 --> 28:33.120
"Sir, I'm sorry, but I'm going to
have to deny myself that privilege."

28:33.880 --> 28:35.920
It got very quiet.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.480
But I hung in there and I said,

28:37.480 --> 28:39.800
"Sir, I'd be more than
happy to make up the call,

28:39.800 --> 28:43.240
"but tonight I'm going
to ask a young lady to marry me."

28:43.240 --> 28:46.480
And without skipping a beat,
Rockenmier says,

28:46.480 --> 28:49.200
"Never cross the path
of a man headed for hell."

28:49.200 --> 28:50.920
Hm!

28:50.920 --> 28:54.920
Well, I got engaged and I got
the second-highest score in surgery.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.400
So, what you're saying is
medicine is wonderful,

28:58.400 --> 29:01.040
but don't forget you're also human?

29:01.040 --> 29:02.720
You never know, Annie.

29:02.720 --> 29:06.720
Some night, some fellow might
skip call and ask you to marry him.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.080
Doctor, do you have time to talk now?

29:21.080 --> 29:24.840
Sure. But I'm on
a pretty tight schedule.

29:24.840 --> 29:28.840
Dr Craig, we're not convinced this
transplant is absolutely necessary.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.560
We'd like a second opinion.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.400
Fine.

29:31.400 --> 29:35.400
Fine.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.040
what makes you the one
to do the operation?

29:38.040 --> 29:40.840
Oh, now we're getting to it.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.040
All right.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.000
One, my years of experience
at all the transplant centres

29:45.000 --> 29:47.200
from Palo Alto to Cape Town.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.880
Two, I have the right facilities.

29:48.880 --> 29:52.400
And three, I've already
been inside her chest once.

29:52.400 --> 29:56.400
I know it better than anyone else.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.000
Even so, we still want
to get another opinion.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.520
Fine. Whom do you have in mind?

30:02.520 --> 30:05.880
A close friend of my wife's
was operated on in Philadelphia

30:05.880 --> 30:07.080
by a Dr Waliskof.

30:07.080 --> 30:10.080
Oh, yes. Charlie Waliskof
at Rittenhouse Hospital.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.160
You know him?

30:11.160 --> 30:11.760
Very well.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.360
Very well.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.360
He'd better be. I trained him.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.400
I've got it. The chart's
right over here.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.560
Elliot?

30:28.560 --> 30:32.560
Elliot, it's OK now.
The patient went up to surgery.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.800
I'm so sorry, Dr Fiscus.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.720
I just got so scared when I saw that
blood coming out from his chest.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.720
The name is Wayne and it's OK.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.280
I'm embarrassed I got so upset.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.480
Medical school students
should be stronger.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.040
Look, Elliot, people get upset
down here all the time.

30:47.040 --> 30:50.120
When you see as much carnage as we
do, you'd be a zombie if you didn't.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.560
That's why we kid around so much,
so we don't go crazy.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.760
I know I'm afraid
of this kind of stuff,

30:54.760 --> 30:56.600
that's why I signed up for ER duty.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.760
I wanted to see
something really frightening,

30:58.760 --> 31:00.680
so I'd be able to handle it.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.480
Just give yourself some time.
When you get a little experience,

31:03.480 --> 31:05.320
you'll realise that nothing
is really that frightening.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.760
you'll realise that nothing
is really that frightening.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.040
I've heard of some
pretty disgusting stuff.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.760
Give me one.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.880
A friend of mine works
the ER at Boston General.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.160
They brought in this woman
that got her leg caught

31:15.160 --> 31:18.720
in a motorcycle wheel. He went in to
check on her, pulled up the sheet...

31:18.720 --> 31:21.360
Her foot was sitting
on her chest. Urgh.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.560
A severed limb is no big deal.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.400
You just pop in an IV,
pack the foot in ice

31:25.400 --> 31:27.360
and support the blood pressure
till the surgeon gets there.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.600
and support the blood pressure
till the surgeon gets there.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.960
It is.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.080
It's got to be for a dummy
like me to learn it.

31:33.080 --> 31:36.960
Look, Elliot, there's just
a few basic rules you have to know

31:36.960 --> 31:39.200
and I'm going
to teach them to you, OK?

31:39.200 --> 31:42.800
Gunshots, stabbings, fires, car
wrecks, none of that is scary stuff.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.480
Really?

31:43.480 --> 31:44.880
Really?

31:44.880 --> 31:45.800
You promise?

31:45.800 --> 31:47.400
You promise?

31:47.400 --> 31:48.880
What is scary?

31:48.880 --> 31:51.400
What is scary?

31:51.400 --> 31:53.280
Scary is when
you wake up in the morning

31:53.280 --> 31:57.200
and it burns when you urinate.

31:57.200 --> 32:01.200
Ohhhh!

32:01.520 --> 32:04.360
(ON TV) 'Why should taxpayers' money
be spent on a statistically'

32:04.360 --> 32:06.680
unsuccessful operation
that requires

32:06.680 --> 32:09.280
unusually demanding
surgical technique?

32:09.280 --> 32:11.320
The problem with
most heart transplants

32:11.320 --> 32:14.680
is not surgical technique,
but tissue rejection...

32:14.680 --> 32:18.680
TV CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Hand me the soap.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.920
Now, isn't this better
than watching Craig get interviewed?

32:35.560 --> 32:39.560
You didn't tell me he brought you up
here from Duke University personally.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.080
Well, I did most of the driving.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.680
Oh.

32:42.680 --> 32:45.200
You did a nice job at the meeting.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.880
I especially liked that noble offer
to go to the health expo,

32:48.880 --> 32:51.640
seeing as how I'm dragging you
with me anyway.

32:51.640 --> 32:52.840
No-one else knew that.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.240
I was hoping for
a few sympathy votes.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.240
Believe me, it was
the hair transplant line

32:57.240 --> 32:59.560
that won you the room.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.720
You managed to keep
the clinic open two days a week

33:02.720 --> 33:04.560
and be Craig's fair-haired boy.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.720
Think it was wise to pretend
we didn't know each other?

33:06.720 --> 33:09.680
Think it was wise to pretend
we didn't know each other?

33:09.680 --> 33:13.600
Shuttling back and forth between
Boston and North Carolina.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.200
Maybe I'll just let them
read my diary.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.240
What diary?

33:17.240 --> 33:21.240
Well, I kind of like to keep
a record of everyone I've worked on.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.120
Oh.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.040
Listen, since I'm not really
in the market for follicle plugs,

33:26.040 --> 33:30.040
you see anything
that needs correcting?

33:31.280 --> 33:32.920
A couple of toes are pretty crooked.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.520
No way you're giving me a toe job.

33:35.520 --> 33:39.520
(THEY LAUGH)

33:51.480 --> 33:55.480
MACHINE BEEPS

33:57.360 --> 34:01.360
BEEPS CONTINUOUSLY

34:07.360 --> 34:10.120
Code's over.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.400
Call the time of death 4am.

34:12.400 --> 34:16.000
'Dr Cavanero, fourth floor...'

34:16.000 --> 34:18.400
Will you notify Dr Golder
the patient's dead?

34:18.400 --> 34:22.400
Who's paging me at this hour?

34:34.120 --> 34:35.800
Good morning, doctor.

34:35.800 --> 34:39.719
Barry. &gt;

34:39.719 --> 34:42.760
Armstrong told me you're not
changing my evaluation,

34:42.760 --> 34:46.159
but I wanted to hear it
face-to-face.

34:46.159 --> 34:50.159
The evaluation stands.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.960
You know, getting kicked out of
a residency is a pretty high price

34:53.960 --> 34:56.000
for a doctor to pay these days.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
As far as I'm concerned,
you got what you paid for.

35:00.400 --> 35:04.400
I will now.

35:07.400 --> 35:11.400
(GROANS)

35:19.400 --> 35:21.320
That ought to do it.

35:21.320 --> 35:25.320
Hang on just a sec.
Let me put some of this on.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.200
Is it all right for me to sit up now?

35:30.200 --> 35:33.640
Is it all right for me to sit up now?

35:33.640 --> 35:36.640
So, let's see how you did.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.920
At least she sewed the right lip.

35:37.920 --> 35:41.040
At least she sewed the right lip.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.480
I'd like to smack him
in the head with a two-by-four.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.240
Oh, I think it gives you character.

35:45.240 --> 35:48.240
Best I could do.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.760
Annie, I don't know what to say.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.000
I'm really sorry, I feel terrible.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.480
It's not your fault.

35:54.480 --> 35:55.920
I encouraged him to talk to you.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.800
I feel sick about the whole thing.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.960
Forget about it.

35:58.960 --> 36:02.080
I bet you're happy. Now you have
an excuse to talk to Dr Caldwell.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.600
Who's Dr Caldwell?

36:03.600 --> 36:05.680
You don't know who Dr Caldwell is?

36:05.680 --> 36:07.920
Maybe we ought
to keep him to ourselves.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.000
He's this new plastic surgeon
and he is primo.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.320
Oh, really?

36:12.320 --> 36:13.360
Mm-hm.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.920
Think he'd go for a woman
who can take a punch?

36:15.920 --> 36:16.960
(LAUGHS)

36:16.960 --> 36:19.240
(GROANS)

36:19.240 --> 36:22.000
Sometimes I think it's a lost cause.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.800
What is?

36:23.800 --> 36:27.280
Relax, Claire. These test papers...

36:27.280 --> 36:29.800
Poor Vinnie Belmont.
No matter how hard he tries,

36:29.800 --> 36:33.600
he can't seem to remember the first
thing about the American Revolution.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.520
But then again, why should
a bunch of 15-year-olds care

36:36.520 --> 36:38.040
who won the Battle of Bunker Hill?

36:38.040 --> 36:40.800
Why should you?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.040
What do you mean?

36:42.040 --> 36:44.520
I went by the school
to pick up those tests,

36:44.520 --> 36:47.560
I got a lovely glimpse of the halls.
Phoebe, that place is a nightmare.

36:47.560 --> 36:50.160
Claire, you've been saying
that for the past 22 years.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.240
Well, look what teaching
there has done for you!

36:52.240 --> 36:53.920
First, you had an awful by-pass.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.240
Now, they're going to cut your heart
out. Are you trying to tell me...

36:55.240 --> 36:58.360
Now, they're going to cut your heart
out. Are you trying to tell me...

36:58.360 --> 37:00.800
Lie down. You're
not supposed to get up.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.280
Why are you trying to give me
an anxiety attack?

37:03.280 --> 37:05.400
I didn't mean to upset you.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.960
TRAIN RUMBLING PAST

37:08.960 --> 37:10.960
Does that subway keep you awake?

37:10.960 --> 37:14.960
No, I like it.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.840
Oh, did you check the garden?

37:18.840 --> 37:22.120
Rod covered all the vines
with plastic.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.920
Did he water them first?

37:23.920 --> 37:27.320
(LAUGHS) Yes!

37:27.320 --> 37:29.760
Thanks.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.720
When the tomatoes come up next June,

37:31.720 --> 37:34.160
you have first pick.

37:34.160 --> 37:38.160
I guess I'd better get back
to the revolution.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.400
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:43.400 --> 37:47.400
No doubt about it.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.200
Here, let me help you with that.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.560
Here, let me help you with that.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.920
Someone needs to talk to my sister.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.280
Why? What's the matter.

38:11.280 --> 38:14.200
She has just agreed to this
whole thing much too quickly.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.000
I'm sure Dr Craig gave her all the
time she needed to think about it.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.520
I know but she just doesn't talk
about the transplant at all.

38:20.520 --> 38:24.040
That worries me. She acts
as if nothing has changed...

38:24.040 --> 38:26.080
like she's just going
to have a tooth pulled.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.800
Have you told her how you feel?

38:27.800 --> 38:30.120
No!

38:30.120 --> 38:31.800
I'm not good at things like that.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.360
I'll have Dr Westphall
talk with her.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.960
You know, I think this kind
of situation makes everyone

38:36.960 --> 38:40.960
feel a little apprehensive, but
let's focus on the positives, OK?

38:41.200 --> 38:42.520
She'll be fine.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.280
Well, I hope so.
Hospitals scare me to death.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.320
I know.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.520
Oh. Thank you.

38:48.520 --> 38:52.520
Here you go.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.800
OK. Time to go.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.320
It sure is.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.360
My driver's on his way.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.400
Great.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.960
Well, this is one trip
I'm really going to enjoy.

39:01.960 --> 39:03.920
We're going via Brooklyn

39:03.920 --> 39:06.840
so I can pick up a nice fat
piece of cheesecake.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.040
(CHUCKLES)

39:08.040 --> 39:10.640
Look at him! He looks like
he's seen a ghost.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.880
You keep eating cheesecake
and you'll be one.

39:12.880 --> 39:13.920
Dr Craig...

39:13.920 --> 39:16.760
I wouldn't do anything
to mess up the job you guys did.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.640
It was just perfect. It really was.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.000
Well, that's the way
we run things around here.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.800
I want you to see your cardiologist
next week and me next month.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.480
Thanks for everything. Thank you.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.800
You're welcome.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.680
Oh, er, there is just one thing.

39:32.680 --> 39:36.680
I think perhaps you forgot
to remove this stitch here.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.880
I've got a suture set right here.

39:59.160 --> 40:03.160
Sir, do you want us
to go on to the next patient?

40:07.280 --> 40:11.280
Rounds are over.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.160
I said rounds are over.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.280
I forgot to tell you, honey.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.120
Dave and Maggie called
while you were asleep.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.160
They want to come up
and see you this weekend.

40:26.160 --> 40:29.640
Driving up from Philly. They want
to know the address of the hospital.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.880
I said don't come here,
she's going to be home.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.560
Right?

40:33.560 --> 40:35.960
Let's go for a walk.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.280
Give me your hand.

40:38.280 --> 40:42.280
Hang on. Pull up.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.840
OK.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.200
Now, get your feet on the ground.

40:46.200 --> 40:49.160
Push this down.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.280
There you go. Now stand.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.480
Push up.

40:53.480 --> 40:56.720
Push up. Plant your right foot.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.120
Plant your right foot.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.080
OK. Now put your weight on it.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.600
Stand up.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.680
Get your balance.

41:04.680 --> 41:05.760
OK.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.760
Let me get your robe.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.000
Honey.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.800
(CRIES)

41:11.800 --> 41:12.840
(CRIES)

41:12.840 --> 41:15.440
You didn't hurt yourself,
you just fell down.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.920
Come on. Get up, honey.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.000
(SOBS) No!

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Come on, sweetie, let's get up.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.440
Come on.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.560
You're OK, honey.

41:23.560 --> 41:24.600
Come on.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.840
No!

41:25.840 --> 41:29.840
(SOBS)

41:30.640 --> 41:32.720
I'm really glad
you saved the clinic.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.120
Even if you did cut the hours.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.240
We reached a mutually
satisfying arrangement,

41:36.240 --> 41:37.720
don't you think, Ms Halloran?

41:37.720 --> 41:39.280
Very satisfying.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.200
I'm a good deal more receptive
than most people give me credit for.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.240
Now that I'm through with all
you doctors and administrators,

41:45.240 --> 41:48.160
I have to go down town and meet
with some really important people.

41:48.160 --> 41:48.880
Nurses.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.760
Nurses.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.440
I'd hate to think what would happen
if some of the doctors

41:53.440 --> 41:54.520
had to learn how
to take care of patients.

41:54.520 --> 41:55.920
had to learn how
to take care of patients.

41:55.920 --> 41:59.120
Bye.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.360
All right, Bobby. I give up.
How did you do it?

42:01.360 --> 42:04.120
I was losing hope, I was sure they
were going to scrap that clinic.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.760
I didn't do anything special.
While everyone was throwing

42:06.760 --> 42:09.480
their weight around, I just tried
to get myself in a position

42:09.480 --> 42:11.680
that a mature, professional
woman would relate to.

42:11.680 --> 42:12.480
How's that?

42:12.480 --> 42:14.120
How's that?

42:14.120 --> 42:18.120
I'll see you later.

42:18.360 --> 42:22.360
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

42:24.280 --> 42:26.000
Mrs Leighton?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.480
Oh, hello, Dr Westphall.

42:28.480 --> 42:31.120
Wonderful music for
a beautiful autumn day.

42:31.120 --> 42:32.440
What more could you ask for?

42:32.440 --> 42:34.080
Ten minutes of your time.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.760
Ten minutes is yours.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.200
What's up?

42:39.200 --> 42:42.080
Well, Mrs Leighton...

42:42.080 --> 42:46.080
as a kidney specialist, I've been
involved in a lot of transplants.

42:46.520 --> 42:49.320
If you have any problems, I'd
like to talk them through with you.

42:49.320 --> 42:52.960
My only problem is instead
of lying around here,

42:52.960 --> 42:56.080
I'd rather be in my classroom
dazzling my kids

42:56.080 --> 42:58.680
with Lincoln's words at Gettysburg.

42:58.680 --> 43:00.760
My father was a teacher in Southy.

43:00.760 --> 43:02.360
Then you know what I'm talking about.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.960
I've got a pretty good idea, yeah.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.080
You know, Dad used to say

43:06.080 --> 43:08.280
that teaching was like
the fountain of youth.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.040
Exactly.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.800
Just when you think
you've seen it all,

43:11.800 --> 43:15.800
a whole new crop of kids comes in
wearing safety pins in their noses.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.600
That's what I love about teaching.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.960
Even before my husband died,
it added something to my life,

43:22.960 --> 43:25.400
something I couldn't find
anywhere else.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.640
That's terrific, it really is.

43:28.640 --> 43:32.640
But you haven't told me
how you feel about the transplant.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.800
Well...

43:34.800 --> 43:36.480
I don't care what it takes

43:36.480 --> 43:39.360
or whose heart is pumping blood
through my body.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.520
When I get on the T to go to school,
I don't care who's driving,

43:42.520 --> 43:46.520
just so long as
it doesn't break down.

43:46.600 --> 43:50.600
What if it does break down and you
don't make it back to the classroom?

43:50.920 --> 43:52.560
Then I die.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.480
Look, I know there aren't
any guarantees but...

43:55.480 --> 43:59.480
I'll do anything to keep living
just as long as I can.

44:00.360 --> 44:02.640
Me too.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.680
Well,

44:03.680 --> 44:07.680
that didn't even take ten minutes.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.920
Do me a favour?

44:10.920 --> 44:12.080
Sure thing.

44:12.080 --> 44:14.040
Tell your sister
what you just told me.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.520
I will. Right after
the next concerto.

44:16.520 --> 44:17.840
OK.

44:17.840 --> 44:21.840
Bye.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.640
How is she?

44:35.640 --> 44:38.400
She wasn't injured in the fall,
but emotionally...

44:38.400 --> 44:39.320
She doesn't want to see you.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.240
She doesn't want to see you.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.280
She doesn't want to see you.

44:41.280 --> 44:44.720
Look, if it wasn't for me,
she'd be dead by now.

44:44.720 --> 44:48.720
Hi, honey.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.960
You're fine. Just got
a little scare, that's all.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.000
Go away.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.200
I know you're upset, you have
every reason in the world to be,

44:56.200 --> 44:58.840
but I'm trying to help you.
You understand that, don't you?

44:58.840 --> 45:00.480
I don't want your help.

45:00.480 --> 45:03.960
You want to get better?

45:03.960 --> 45:05.040
Not better.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.520
Don't talk like that now.

45:06.520 --> 45:10.520
Mr Singleton, I really
don't think now... &gt;

45:11.280 --> 45:12.600
You want to be a vegetable?

45:12.600 --> 45:15.120
You want to end up lying
flat on your back in a hospital room

45:15.120 --> 45:16.280
for the rest of your life?
Is that what you want?

45:16.280 --> 45:17.320
for the rest of your life?
Is that what you want?

45:17.320 --> 45:18.400
No, it's not you.

45:18.400 --> 45:19.600
Let's get a cup of coffee.

45:19.600 --> 45:20.280
I don't want a cup of coffee.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.160
I don't want a cup of coffee.

45:21.160 --> 45:24.520
I don't want a cup of coffee.

45:24.520 --> 45:26.840
You're not a quitter, Fran,
you never have been

45:26.840 --> 45:29.240
and I am not going to allow you
to start becoming one now.

45:29.240 --> 45:30.480
Do you understand that?

45:30.480 --> 45:32.760
I...

45:32.760 --> 45:36.760
..hate you.

46:12.760 --> 46:16.760
Help.

46:36.240 --> 46:49.000
