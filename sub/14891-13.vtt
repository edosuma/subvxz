Big news, I’ve just been given
my first official duty

01:27.453 --> 01:28.622
as an American citizen.

01:28.655 --> 01:31.391
I’m going to be serving
on the jury.

Well, isn’t that nice?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.828
I’m so excited.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.763
Well, Balki,
you should be excited.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.498
Jury duty is one of
the most important things

01:38.532 --> 01:40.501
an American citizen can do.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.203
And it’s vital that, uh,
every citizen do their share

the judicial system.

to do than this.

How can we be assigned to
jury duty at the same time?

02:11.364 --> 02:12.566

You see, uh, I’ve been going
down to the courthouse every day

02:18.739 --> 02:21.174

the courthouse clerk

02:21.207 --> 02:25.912
to put our names at the top
of the jury duty list.

"Listen to me,
you swarthy little twit."

02:46.432 --> 02:48.802
That, that’s his
little nickname for me.

02:53.640 --> 02:59.345
But you have to promise to never
ever come to see me again."

02:59.379 --> 03:00.847

others to know

03:00.881 --> 03:02.683
that he did me a special favor.

‐No, you wouldn’t.
‐Yes, I would.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.002
‐No, you wouldn’t.
‐Yes, I would.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.203
‐No, you wouldn’t.
‐Yes, I would!

13:24.404 --> 13:25.572
Tell me. Tell me.

13:25.606 --> 13:27.073
Okay, Cousin.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.443
Aside from the glaringly
obvious fact

13:30.476 --> 13:31.978
that the plaid jacket
don’t belong

13:32.012 --> 13:33.379
in the defendant’s wardrobe

13:33.413 --> 13:34.848
I noticed...

13:36.116 --> 13:38.251
...that over a
five minute period

13:38.284 --> 13:41.121
the defendant blinked his eyes

13:41.154 --> 13:43.590
...twenty‐seven times.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.961
I also noticed

13:47.994 --> 13:51.331
he crossed his hands
right over left.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.365
Now...

13:54.000 --> 13:55.869
If that don’t say innocent

13:55.902 --> 13:57.538
I don’t know what does.

14:03.209 --> 14:04.210
Okay.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.882
Let’s see.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.884
Eye blinking...

14:10.917 --> 14:12.886
‐Twenty‐seven times!
‐Mm‐hm.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.391
‐Hands crossed right over left.
‐Right over left.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.530
And the aforementioned
wardrobe inconsistency.

14:23.564 --> 14:26.432
"Wardrobe inconsistency."

14:29.636 --> 14:31.371
Are you out of your mind?

14:33.540 --> 14:36.342
Those are the stupidest
observations I have ever heard!

14:37.377 --> 14:39.145
Balki, this is America!

14:39.179 --> 14:40.413
And in America

14:40.446 --> 14:42.282
we use the facts.

14:43.950 --> 14:46.419
And you, as an American citizen

14:46.452 --> 14:48.522
must use the facts.

14:51.324 --> 14:55.261
Cousin, I listened
to the facts!

14:59.600 --> 15:01.101
And I want you to know

15:01.134 --> 15:04.004
that all of the evidence
was circumcisional.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.311
Alright, alright, alright.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.580
Alright, Balki,
I am going to show you

15:13.614 --> 15:15.481
exactly what happened.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.350
We are going
to re‐enact the crime.

15:17.383 --> 15:18.418
Oh! We’re going to act!

15:18.451 --> 15:20.420
Okay.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.256
Alright, now, I will be
the gas station attendant.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.125
‐You be the robber.
‐No, I’m not gonna be‐‐

15:25.158 --> 15:27.093
‐You be the robber‐‐
‐I’m not gonna be the robber.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.329
I’m not gonna be some scum‐bug

15:29.362 --> 15:32.098
pig‐breath robber whose
name wasn’t even Bob.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.037
‐Fine, you be the attendant.
‐I can’t be the attendant.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.138
My shirt is too clean.

15:40.741 --> 15:42.643
Y‐y‐you, you just
started your shift.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.082
‐Okay, I could make that work.
‐Uh...

15:53.419 --> 15:55.255
Okay, alright, now

15:55.288 --> 15:58.224
when I, as the robber, come in

15:58.258 --> 16:00.661
you, as the attendant,
are behind the counter.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.095
‐Okay, now, I come in‐‐
‐Cousin, Cousin...

16:02.128 --> 16:03.029
‐No, wait, wait, wait...
‐I come in, I got the‐‐

16:03.063 --> 16:04.497
‐If I’m the attendant‐‐
‐What, what, what?

16:04.531 --> 16:06.567
Then this, you have
to move more that way

16:06.600 --> 16:08.635
because this is not really,
the counter right here.

16:08.669 --> 16:11.137
You know, this is the peanut
display right here

16:11.171 --> 16:13.373
And right over here
is the beef jerky.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.008
‐And I just‐‐
‐Balki, you know something?

16:15.041 --> 16:17.410
I don’t care about
your beef jerky

16:17.443 --> 16:19.179
or your peanut display!

16:20.446 --> 16:23.049
All I care about
is going to Bermuda.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.184
I mean upholding justice!

16:27.187 --> 16:29.089
Excuse me?

16:30.123 --> 16:33.493
Going to Bermuda?

16:33.527 --> 16:35.061
Well, who wouldn’t
want to go to Bermuda?

16:35.095 --> 16:36.196
But that is not the point.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.397
Okay, now,
you’re the attendant

16:37.430 --> 16:39.232
we’re over here,
your beef jerky is here.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.101
‐You’ve got your‐‐
‐Listen to me.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.472
Cut the babasticki!

16:50.744 --> 16:53.146
You want me
to vote guilty

16:53.179 --> 16:56.416
and send an innocent man
to rot away in prison

16:56.449 --> 16:58.585
so that you can go
to Bermuda with Jennifer?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.487
That’s not it at all!

17:03.256 --> 17:06.059
‐Then what is it?
‐Okay, that’s it!

17:07.292 --> 17:08.795
But, y‐y‐you,
you don’t understand!

17:08.829 --> 17:10.430
Don’t you understand that
the‐the tickets are prepaid‐‐

17:10.463 --> 17:11.497
Cousin...

17:11.531 --> 17:12.464
‐And‐and Jennifer‐‐
‐Cousin...

17:12.498 --> 17:14.367
All she’s bringing
is this, this little‐‐

17:14.400 --> 17:17.503
‐Cousin...
‐This tiny thing just blow...

17:17.538 --> 17:19.673
And I was, you know,
thinking maybe we could...

17:19.705 --> 17:22.809
[panting]

17:22.843 --> 17:26.279
You know what, you’re not
the only one who had plans.

17:26.311 --> 17:29.482
Today is the last day
that the carnival is in town

17:29.516 --> 17:31.852
and I was planning to go down
and see how many times

17:31.885 --> 17:34.187
I could ride the Tilt‐O‐Whirl
before I got sick

17:34.220 --> 17:35.589
and now that dream
is shattered!

17:39.860 --> 17:42.062
[instrumental music]

17:42.829 --> 17:46.399
(Balki)
’He blinked
27 times.’

17:46.432 --> 17:47.601
’Okay?’

17:47.634 --> 17:50.170
Twenty‐seven times!

17:52.338 --> 17:55.375
No plane, no Bermuda...

17:56.610 --> 17:58.244
...no bikini.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.783
You know, I’m gettin’
just a little

18:02.816 --> 18:05.418
sick and tired of you,
Captain Garlic.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.690
Why don’t we try a little
physical persuasion

18:09.723 --> 18:12.258
to help him come
to the right decision?

18:12.292 --> 18:15.295
All I am trying to do
is to prevent you

18:15.328 --> 18:18.498
all of you, from making
a horrible mistake.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.301
And just for your information
a clove of raw garlic

18:21.334 --> 18:23.236
each day will
ward off heart attack.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.470
[deep sighing]

18:25.772 --> 18:27.407
Alright, all those in favor

18:27.440 --> 18:29.275
of pulverizing
this guy, say "Aye!"

18:29.309 --> 18:30.511
(jury)
Aye!

18:30.544 --> 18:31.812
‐I’m gonna enjoy this...
‐Let’s get him.

18:31.845 --> 18:32.879
Cousin. Cousin.

18:32.913 --> 18:34.147
[indistinct chatter]

18:34.180 --> 18:35.215
Cousin, Cousin‐‐

18:35.248 --> 18:36.349
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:36.382 --> 18:37.751
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

18:37.784 --> 18:39.720
Stop getting... Hey, hey, hey!

18:39.753 --> 18:41.121
Cut it out!

18:42.923 --> 18:45.792
What you are doing is wrong!

18:45.826 --> 18:48.929
You’re condemning a‐a man
for having the guts

18:48.962 --> 18:51.732
to stand up for what
he believes in

18:51.765 --> 18:53.734
no matter how stupid it is.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.706
So, so‐so what if
we’re inconvenienced

18:59.740 --> 19:01.174
for a couple of days?

19:02.342 --> 19:04.911
Missing our vacations...

19:04.945 --> 19:07.480
...locked away from our wives.

19:07.514 --> 19:11.718
and their‐their, their teeny
tiny little bikinis.

19:14.888 --> 19:16.356
Let’s get him!
Come on!

19:17.357 --> 19:18.391
Alright, no, no!

19:18.424 --> 19:19.492
Wait! Wait!

19:19.526 --> 19:22.195
Stand back. Get back!

19:23.597 --> 19:25.566
Whose side are you on, anyway?

19:25.599 --> 19:27.467
Now listen, Cousin,
let‐let‐let me just try

19:27.500 --> 19:28.935
try talking to them
for a second.

19:28.969 --> 19:31.204
I‐I‐I have a way
with angry mobs.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.441
Fellow jurors, please.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.778
You are acting exactly
like a flock of sheep

19:37.811 --> 19:39.345
before the winter shearing.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.617
You’re, you’re jumpy

19:43.650 --> 19:46.286
itchy, chafed.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.858
Let’s hurt him! Come on...

19:51.892 --> 19:53.694
No!

19:53.727 --> 19:56.663
[all groaning]

19:58.331 --> 20:00.233
[indistinct chatter]

20:01.735 --> 20:04.470
Alright, just hold
your breath and he’s ours!

20:04.505 --> 20:05.672
[deep gasping]

20:06.940 --> 20:09.543
[indistinct yelling]

20:11.778 --> 20:14.347
Excuse me!

20:16.683 --> 20:18.418
Hello, heh...

20:18.451 --> 20:21.588
...just having
a little discussion.

20:21.622 --> 20:24.024
Yeah, well, there’s
nothing more to discuss

20:24.057 --> 20:25.559
they caught
the real thief

20:25.592 --> 20:28.361
and he confessed
and the judge dropped

20:28.394 --> 20:31.565
all the charges
against Mr. Taylor.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.667
Anyway, you people
are free to go.

20:34.835 --> 20:36.837
Well, let’s get outta here.

20:36.870 --> 20:37.938
‐Let’s go.
‐Okay.

20:37.971 --> 20:38.972
Let’s get out of here.

20:43.777 --> 20:45.546
Look, pal, I’m...

20:45.579 --> 20:47.548
...I’m sorry, uh...

20:47.581 --> 20:50.416
‐No offense, huh?
‐Hey, you were venting.

20:55.789 --> 20:58.024
Well... Balki

20:58.058 --> 20:59.492
I’m sorry you had to see

20:59.526 --> 21:02.295
the ugly side of jury duty .

21:03.997 --> 21:06.733
I’m sure our being attacked
by a mob of angry jurors

21:06.767 --> 21:08.969
wasn’t exactly the experience
you were looking for.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.505
No, uh, it wasn’t, but, uh...

21:11.538 --> 21:13.940
...the good news
is that an innocent man

21:13.974 --> 21:17.410
is going home and a guilty man
is going to jail.

21:18.579 --> 21:20.046
And it’s‐it’s nice to know

21:20.080 --> 21:24.050
that one small garlicky voice

21:24.084 --> 21:25.451
can make a difference.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.790
I’m just sorry
I had to miss my plane

21:29.823 --> 21:32.058
to Bermuda to learn that.

21:32.092 --> 21:34.595
Oh, you can still
make it to Bermuda.

21:34.628 --> 21:36.797
See, according
to airline policy

21:36.830 --> 21:39.666
when serving jury duty,
a note from the court

21:39.700 --> 21:41.968
is an exception
to restricted air travel.

21:42.002 --> 21:43.003
I’ll get you one.

21:43.937 --> 21:45.405
W‐w‐well, thank you.

21:46.006 --> 21:47.641
Well, this is great!

21:47.674 --> 21:49.976
Cousin, this worked
out swell for everybody

21:50.010 --> 21:52.412
Justice was served
and you get to go

21:52.445 --> 21:54.548
to Bermuda with
Jennifer and...

21:54.581 --> 21:56.449
...that means that,
uh, Mary Anne and I

21:56.482 --> 21:59.352
will have the...house
to ourselves, uh...

22:03.557 --> 22:04.925
You know what
that means, don’t you?

22:06.960 --> 22:08.028
Huh?

22:08.061 --> 22:10.997
[laughter]

22:20.140 --> 22:22.543
‐Giant jigsaw puzzles?
‐You know me so well.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.847
[theme music]

22:33.153 --> 22:35.355
[theme music]
