01:05.982 --> 01:07.859
Your best birthday present ever.

01:07.942 --> 01:10.403
Even tops the 10 pound slab
of bubble gum

01:10.487 --> 01:11.905
I got ya last year.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.615
Hey, waffles, must be that

01:13.698 --> 01:15.533
hot new skateboard I wanted.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.911
Or a video game
or a--

01:18.036 --> 01:19.537
Baseball bat.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.331
And ball and glove.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.042
Very same ones your dad used.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.712
Ever tell you I used to
strike out every batter in little league?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.047
Only about 100 times.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.388
Well, now I'm gonna teach you
to play as good as I did.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.932
Hey-o, Daddy-o, that's okay.

01:39.015 --> 01:42.018
I'm not really the most sports-oriented
guy in the world, you know?

01:42.102 --> 01:45.855
All it takes is practice, practice,
and more practice.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.191
First, I'll teach you to bunt.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.027
Now, you got to fool
the pitcher and the catcher,

01:51.111 --> 01:52.696
and even yourself.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.031
[honk]

01:55.115 --> 01:58.910
Then you gotta take off
like a fly with a swatter on its tail.

01:59.035 --> 02:02.288
A good base runner's
gotta have coordination...

02:08.586 --> 02:09.838
Stamina...

02:12.257 --> 02:15.427
Whoa!

02:15.510 --> 02:17.220
Persistence...

02:19.556 --> 02:21.182
A keen eye!

02:22.475 --> 02:23.518
But most important,

02:23.601 --> 02:26.187
he's gotta know when to slide.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.815
Simple, huh?

02:28.898 --> 02:30.442
Just look at the time!

02:30.525 --> 02:34.154
I clean forgot. I'm having my teeth
drilled in 20 minutes. Later!

02:34.237 --> 02:36.239
Oral hygiene's important,

02:36.448 --> 02:39.743
but 20 minutes is all I need
to teach you to hit a home run.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.494
[grunting]

02:41.995 --> 02:45.582
Please, Dad. It's been six hours.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.125
Can't I take a break?

02:47.208 --> 02:49.502
Weeds don't take breaks.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.504
They turn into jungles.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.215
Want your mom to get et by a tiger

02:54.299 --> 02:55.842
in our own backyard?

02:58.136 --> 03:02.057
Dad, I'm just not sure
baseball's really my thing.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.475
Oh, it's a cinch.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.352
Just keep swinging, and sooner or later

03:05.435 --> 03:06.978
the ball will get in the way.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.317
Huh? Hey, what?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.819
Anybody seen Maxie's ball?

03:16.154 --> 03:19.157
Your kid hit this?

03:19.240 --> 03:22.952
Yup. Going to be the next Mickey Mantle.

03:23.036 --> 03:23.912
Dad!

03:25.038 --> 03:26.247
You don't say?

03:26.831 --> 03:27.999
Come on, junior.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.461
If that chip off the old Goof-up
could do that,

03:31.544 --> 03:33.296
you could be the next DiMaggio.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.715
Baseball? Oh, Dad.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.467
You know I'm no good at sports.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.302
Okay, the next Koufax.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.388
But...the weeds!

03:41.471 --> 03:43.431
Yeah, the weeds. What about
the weeds, Dad?

03:43.515 --> 03:44.724
I mean, it is a jungle out there.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.684
You can see it's a jungle.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.602
You want Mom to get attacked by a gorilla?

03:47.686 --> 03:49.562
You don't want that, do you now, Dad?

03:50.313 --> 03:52.440
[Pete] Did I ever tell you
how I used to be

03:52.524 --> 03:55.985
a catchin' ace in little league?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.404
Caught anything that moved--

03:57.487 --> 04:00.365
Pitches. Popped fouls. Field mice.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.784
You're gonna be as good as I was.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.245
You got my talent, see.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.623
Oh, I just forgot. Didn't you want me
to wash the car?

04:08.707 --> 04:09.958
Oh, and floss. Gotta floss.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.168
And clean my room? Paint the house.
Gotta paint the house.

04:13.003 --> 04:17.424
What? The future greatest ball player
in the world work

04:17.507 --> 04:19.175
when you could be having fun?

04:19.634 --> 04:22.178
Now, come on. Let me see ya
catch one.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.805
[yelping]

04:24.055 --> 04:28.143
That's putting your mouth
where your mitt is.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.811
Now let me see ya slide.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.649
No, no, no, no, no!

04:35.233 --> 04:38.361
I got a method that could even teach
mud to slide.

04:38.778 --> 04:42.115
[screaming]

04:42.782 --> 04:43.700
Ptooey!

04:43.783 --> 04:46.619
Ah, dude, not you, too?

04:46.745 --> 04:51.458
[coughs] Yeah. Welcome to
baseball boot camp, bud.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.169
Well, did you see that, Goof?

04:54.252 --> 04:57.839
Nothing stands between my major leaguer
and a big play.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.175
He's gonna be one of the greats!

05:00.258 --> 05:02.761
A great water boy

05:02.844 --> 05:04.304
if he plays like you did.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.806
Ha! If your kid plays like you did,

05:06.890 --> 05:08.808
they wouldn't let him be a bat boy.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.976
-Water boy!
-Bat boy!

05:10.060 --> 05:12.562
-Bat boy!
-Water boy!

05:12.937 --> 05:15.231
[Pete grunts] Come here, ace!

05:17.275 --> 05:18.693
Show 'em your stuff!

05:20.695 --> 05:22.489
Whoa!

05:23.031 --> 05:25.492
What'd I tell you? Water boy!

05:25.617 --> 05:29.537
Pete, you couldn't teach a surfboard
to catch a wave.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.914
Show 'em, slugger.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.626
Bat boy! Ha ha ha!

05:34.709 --> 05:37.295
You couldn't teach
lightning to hit a tree.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.338
Ow!

05:43.218 --> 05:45.178
Here you go-- Vita-slime!

05:45.261 --> 05:46.888
Health goop of champions.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.432
Makes you run a mile in a minute flat.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.392
[bubbling]

05:52.894 --> 05:55.814
[laughs] Even the smell works wonders.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.983
Now, every catcher's
got to know signals, see.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.735
Lost a game once

06:00.819 --> 06:04.239
'cause some dodo pitcher mixed them up.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.240
Are you ready?

06:05.323 --> 06:07.158
Okay, sinker.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.576
Slider. Curve ball.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.994
Fast ball. Screwball.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.162
Bowling ball. Hair ball. Got it?

06:11.496 --> 06:12.539
[stammering]

06:12.664 --> 06:15.000
Good. Now, let me have this.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.549
Home run ball. And the kid
wasn't even batting.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.509
Nuh-uh. That was a breakin' ball.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.178
Oh, you couldn't tell
a meatball from a cheese ball.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.973
That's why you lost us that championship.

06:30.056 --> 06:33.143
You the one that got us
kicked out of little league.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.729
I pitched what you signaled--an odd ball.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.314
What? I signaled a screwball!

06:38.398 --> 06:40.734
-[bickering continues]
-Those two were teammates?

06:40.817 --> 06:44.404
That's like putting a dog on
the same team with his fleas.

06:44.487 --> 06:48.491
We're settling this score
once and for all.

06:49.451 --> 06:53.872
[laughs] Would I have got that
for losing the game?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.916
Nope. It says "for best attendance."

06:57.042 --> 07:00.712
But feast your eyes
on what the coach gave me.

07:01.046 --> 07:05.300
"Mr. Congeniality"? Ha ha ha!

07:05.383 --> 07:07.635
A smile a day don't keep the ball in play.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.347
And a Goof ball don't win games.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.348
Says who?

07:11.431 --> 07:14.768
Oh, man. This one's going extra innings.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.395
Maybe not. Come on. I got an idea.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.022
What are you talkin' about?

07:19.105 --> 07:22.025
You wouldn't know
a sourball from an eyeball.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.486
Well, you wouldn't know a cue ball--

07:24.569 --> 07:26.488
[kids] Aah!

07:26.571 --> 07:29.032
-Aah!
-oh, the pain!

07:29.115 --> 07:32.327
Freak fieldin' accident. Oh, pain.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.621
Sprained every muscle in our bodies.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.705
Oh!

07:36.915 --> 07:40.502
I won't be able to practice for
at least a year.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.587
No, two! It's gotta be--oh!

07:42.712 --> 07:44.673
-Maybe-- Maybe 20.
-Yeah.

07:44.756 --> 07:48.259
Nah. My secret liniment
will fix ya up in no time.

07:48.343 --> 07:52.097
Well, my secret stretching cure's
faster than that.

They're gonna make us practice
Till we're as good as they were.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.718
Or till they think we are.

08:30.802 --> 08:31.886
Okey-doke.

08:31.970 --> 08:35.098
Let me see a real sizzler.

Yo, Pop!

08:57.245 --> 09:00.665
Go on out front, and I'll hit one
clear over the house.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.042
That a boy, P.J.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.627
Put that puppy in orbit.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.046
You heard the man.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.631
Orbit ball in the side pocket.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.347
Look what Maxie's pitchin'
did to my glove.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.852
Look what P.J.'s hittin' did to the ball.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.688
They're better than we ever were.

09:23.772 --> 09:27.692
Yeah. No point in making them
practice anymore.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.027
What'd I tell ya?

09:29.402 --> 09:34.366
[gasps] I bet old Coach Roach
just begs them to join the team.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.784
Join?

09:35.867 --> 09:36.785
Wha-what team?

09:36.868 --> 09:39.454
Why, our old little league team--

09:39.537 --> 09:41.539
The Spoonerville Sluggers.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.125
You'll even have our old coach!

09:44.209 --> 09:47.003
Didn't we tell you? Tryouts are tomorrow.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.965
[both] what do you think
we been teaching you for?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.889
Come on.
Gonna be late for tryouts.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.437
Never mind chewin'. Just swallow.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.022
[Pete] Relax! Hurry up! Don't panic!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.357
What am I doing?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.360
Dead meat doesn't need a last meal.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.362
Something's gotta happen to save us--

10:12.445 --> 10:15.198
A flood, earthquake, alien invasion, pox.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.117
Don't forget what we taught ya.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.952
-Know your signals.
-Read your ball.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.495
-Hug your bases. Cover your 'nads.
-Bat your bat.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.455
Boys! Boys!

10:22.956 --> 10:26.209
You two make mother hens
look like absentee parents.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.753
Why don't you just let them go alone?

10:28.837 --> 10:31.965
[gulps] A-a-a-alone?

10:32.048 --> 10:34.426
W-w-without their dads?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.594
[both] but they need us!

10:36.678 --> 10:39.806
What they need is a break.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.266
Okay, sugar cube.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.892
Maybe you're right.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.185
Now, break a leg.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.520
Break two.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.814
[P.J.] I'll see what I can do, Dad.

10:47.897 --> 10:48.815
[Max] Yeah.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.985
Just think, our boys...

10:52.068 --> 10:53.820
In our old uniforms...

10:53.903 --> 10:56.322
Trying out for our old team.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.497
[Max] Maybe this
won't be so bad.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.426
You were saying?

11:21.473 --> 11:25.810
I got a fuzzy feelin' I've seen you two
bleacher bums before.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.146
Don't think so, Coach.

11:30.148 --> 11:32.776
Must be a case of misshapen identity.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.444
Okay, show me what you got.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.226
[coach] Yugh!

12:06.309 --> 12:09.104
Go try bowlin' or somethin'.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.026
[Goofy] I've dreamed of Maxie

12:15.110 --> 12:17.529
making little league all his life.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.949
I know what you mean.
I dreamt of P.J. making it.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.535
Wished on all my birthday candles,

12:23.618 --> 12:25.954
lucky stars, chicken wishbones...

12:26.037 --> 12:29.124
Why, I'd give my car dealership
and your house

12:29.207 --> 12:31.209
for P.J. to make that team.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.169
Can we tell your dad first?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.587
I'm still writing my will.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.466
Come on, Peej. We just gotta face this
head-on.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.429
Hey, hey, hey, there, Goofer.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.223
Do you see what I see?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.726
Gawrsh! All I'm seein'

12:47.809 --> 12:49.561
is stars!

12:51.146 --> 12:53.648
[both] Welcome home, aces!

12:54.024 --> 12:56.026
You knocked 'em for a loop, right?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.278
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.988
Ah, you hear that modesty, Goof?

13:00.071 --> 13:02.782
He must have smacked one
out of the ball park.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.535
Not as such, Dad.
You see, it's kinda like this--

13:05.618 --> 13:09.622
Know what? Must have struck out
the whole team... twice.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.666
Dad, there's something we gotta tell ya--

13:11.750 --> 13:15.211
Ooh, let me guess.
They made you a pitcher, just like me!

13:15.295 --> 13:19.007
Made you a catcher, huh? Just like me.

13:19.591 --> 13:20.967
They did it!

13:21.051 --> 13:23.261
-I can't wait!
-[cheering]

13:23.553 --> 13:24.763
[laughing]

13:24.804 --> 13:25.722
-Oh!
-Oh!

13:26.723 --> 13:29.684
Oh, man, in the soup without a ladle.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.561
Why didn't we just tell 'em?

13:31.644 --> 13:32.771
How could we, P.J.?

13:32.854 --> 13:34.606
We woulda broken their hearts.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.608
Yeah, but they're gonna find out anyway

13:36.691 --> 13:38.443
when they go to next week's game.

13:38.526 --> 13:42.072
You mean if they go to next week's game.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.034
Let's go, slugger.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.660
First game of the season.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.123
Oh, boy, Dad. I can hardly wait.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.836
[engine sputters]

13:59.923 --> 14:02.592
[choking]

14:03.343 --> 14:06.012
Gosh, Dad,
What's wrong?

14:06.805 --> 14:11.351
The car's sick. Give us a lift,
and I'll treat you to slugger dogs.

14:12.477 --> 14:16.398
Mine's sick, too. Musta caught it
from your car.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.693
Golly! Sounds like a car virus
is goin' around.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.611
We better take our bikes. See ya later.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.990
What the-- Look at this!

14:26.074 --> 14:29.661
Somebody put cement in our tailpipes.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.288
The Spoonerville Sluggers

14:32.372 --> 14:36.001
win the first game of the season 9-0.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.677
When I catch that son
of a two-headed rattlesnake

14:45.802 --> 14:49.431
that kept us from seein'
our boys play, I'm gonna--

14:49.514 --> 14:53.018
[Maxie] Hey, yeah!
The sluggers won!

14:53.184 --> 14:54.477
What a game!

14:54.561 --> 14:56.104
It was awesome!

14:56.187 --> 14:58.314
[both] They did it!

14:58.440 --> 15:00.984
-What'd you bat, 1000?
-2000?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.777
You probably struck 'em all out.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.696
-Uh, sort of like that.
-Well, uh...

15:04.779 --> 15:06.573
[overlapping chatter]

15:08.241 --> 15:11.202
Modesty! Ha ha!

15:11.661 --> 15:16.166
Well, we'll just read all about it on
tomorrow's sports page.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.959
[both] Sports page.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.565
Aw-hyuck!

15:42.359 --> 15:43.485
Unh!

15:43.568 --> 15:44.486
What?

15:44.569 --> 15:46.613
My star pullin' weeds?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.156
Forget them chores.

15:48.239 --> 15:51.576
As a reward for being a baseball ace,
no more cleaning--

15:51.659 --> 15:56.414
But, Dad, that's okay
I'm not really an ace. [stammering]

15:57.374 --> 15:59.793
Whoa! I'll do that.

15:59.876 --> 16:04.297
Can't have you battin' a 1000
with dishpan hands.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.841
Comfy, boys?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.635
You pick the program.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.096
We'll change the channels.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.349
[gulp]

16:14.641 --> 16:15.767
I can't stand it.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.894
The guilt's giving me a migraine.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.564
Triple migraine. We gotta keep 'em
out of 19 more games.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.899
Ohhh.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.277
[squeaking]

16:28.363 --> 16:30.073
[revving]

16:34.119 --> 16:36.621
[cheering]

16:46.798 --> 16:49.342
[chirping]

16:54.806 --> 16:58.351
Last game of the season,
and we're home free!

16:58.435 --> 16:59.978
[Goofy] Oh, boys!

17:00.353 --> 17:02.022
We may have missed your other games,

17:02.105 --> 17:04.149
But we ain't missin' this one.

17:04.274 --> 17:07.318
And this time, you're goin' in style.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.407
[Goofy] Got a surprise.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.617
You boys have been playin' so well,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.704
after this game, we're takin' you out
of little league...

17:17.787 --> 17:20.957
And puttin' ya in the big leagues!

17:21.374 --> 17:22.876
[both] Yikes!

17:28.798 --> 17:31.217
Called every major league scout
in the country.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.886
Organized a media blitz!

17:33.011 --> 17:35.972
Even got the astronauts
to watch it on satellite TV!

17:36.056 --> 17:38.266
Got a few words for our TV audience?

17:38.350 --> 17:40.393
Well, um...

17:40.518 --> 17:41.603
Play ball!

17:41.686 --> 17:42.854
Sorry. Gotta go!

17:43.521 --> 17:46.608
If we can just stay inconspicuous
for 9 innings.

17:47.150 --> 17:51.279
Batting first, Claude Harper.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.908
What? They're not puttin' our kids
in first?

17:55.158 --> 17:57.452
Maybe savin' the best for last?

17:58.495 --> 18:00.288
Well, okay. We'll wait.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.766
[ding]

18:21.976 --> 18:24.020
[Goofy] we've waited
long enough.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.940
Yeah. How come
your star pitcher and catcher

18:27.023 --> 18:28.191
ain't seein' any action?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.776
Stars?

18:29.859 --> 18:32.404
Hey, didn't I kick these two
outta baseball?

18:32.487 --> 18:36.074
No. You kicked us out... 30 years ago!

18:36.157 --> 18:37.826
These are our sons.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.328
I guess when you get to be my age,

18:40.412 --> 18:42.205
Everything runs together.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.958
Yeah, all right, let's see
what they can do.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.292
Okay, Maxie,

18:46.376 --> 18:49.838
let's see you fire a few strikes
into P.J.'s glove.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.598
Now, don't panic!

19:00.682 --> 19:01.599
Relax.

19:01.683 --> 19:02.934
Take it easy.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.520
Don't forget everything I taught ya!

19:13.820 --> 19:15.989
What's got into you two?

19:16.072 --> 19:19.159
We musta lost our stuff.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.454
Yeah, and I don't think
we're gonna find it anytime soon.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.539
They've hit a slump!

19:24.664 --> 19:27.083
That's okay. It happens to
all the greats.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.836
Gonna miss their big shot at the big time.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.504
No, they're not.

19:32.756 --> 19:35.133
And so, in the bottom of the 9th,

19:35.216 --> 19:39.637
Sluggers lead it 7-3.
2 outs and the bases empty.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.640
Ready-- Ahem. Ready, coach.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.354
Sinker, Goof. Gets 'em every time.

19:49.439 --> 19:50.815
Winker blinker it is.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.903
And the pitch is... Well, anybody's guess.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.199
-It's mine!
-Mine!

20:01.076 --> 20:02.118
-Let go.
-You--you...

20:04.079 --> 20:05.497
A home run!

20:05.830 --> 20:06.706
But...

20:06.790 --> 20:09.250
Wow. And we thought we were bad.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.170
Knuckle ball, you goof.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.172
Fire ball, it is.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.424
Lead's been cut to 7-4.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.218
Things could be heating up.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.512
They don't get hotter than that.

20:21.179 --> 20:23.139
High fly down the third base line.

20:23.223 --> 20:26.643
Going, going...gone!

20:26.726 --> 20:29.062
Slugger lead slips to 2.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.316
Plier ball, you brainless beanpole.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.323
Head ball.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.034
Foot ball.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.578
Hand ball.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.540
He walked 'em all!

20:48.623 --> 20:51.292
Screwball in the hip pocket,

20:51.376 --> 20:53.545
and this time get it right.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.297
Side ball in the corner pocket?

20:56.381 --> 20:57.799
I hope he knows what he's doin'.

20:57.924 --> 21:02.595
The pitch is... Up, up, and away!

21:07.642 --> 21:08.977
You fizzbrain!

21:09.060 --> 21:11.271
Curve ball in the shirt pocket?

21:11.354 --> 21:13.565
Or was it the pants pocket?

21:13.898 --> 21:15.567
That wasn't the pitch I signaled!

21:15.650 --> 21:19.237
...scores!
The winning run is rounding third.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.406
[Pete] No!

21:21.489 --> 21:23.783
Grand slam, wild pitch!

21:23.867 --> 21:28.621
And the sluggers come from
ahead to lose it 7-8.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.958
Only know two guys
who could Goof up like that.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.793
Goofy and Pete.

21:34.919 --> 21:38.340
You're banned from baseball forever!

21:38.423 --> 21:40.133
Don't even watch it on TV,

21:40.258 --> 21:43.887
or trade baseball cards,
or chew bubble gum!

21:43.970 --> 21:45.513
[both] Unreal!

21:48.641 --> 21:52.479
Gawrsh! Now I know how
Shoeless Joe Jackson felt.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.731
Aww, Dad, who needs baseball?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.775
There's better things to play.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.444
Yeah. Like football.

21:59.569 --> 22:02.447
Hey, the season's just startin'.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.115
Football!

22:04.282 --> 22:06.868

quarterback myself.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.662

22:09.746 --> 22:11.247

everything we know.

Okay, boys. Back for the pass!
