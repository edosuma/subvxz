I'm sure he was
very angry.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.891
- I just don't understand
why you left.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.937
- When I first met your father,
he was so handsome and charming,

02:26.020 --> 02:28.565
it was love at
first sight.

02:28.648 --> 02:32.235

your brother go today?

be dangerous.

been able to find Liana?

06:43.402 --> 06:46.989

But I knew I needed help

good witches and bad witches.

is one of the bad ones.

from your heart, huh?

07:07.135 --> 07:09.345

07:09.428 --> 07:11.347
- Mom, she didn't
care about helping you.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.474
She only cared about keeping
Jessie away from the Realm

You have to really

that scientists say

09:48.879 --> 09:49.922
- I do!

09:50.006 --> 09:51.299
Happy to help.
- Great!

09:51.382 --> 09:51.632
Let's do this now!

09:55.469 --> 09:56.345
Daniel!

09:56.429 --> 09:57.930
You need to relax!

09:58.014 --> 09:59.849
- Okay, Emma,
yelling at him to relax

09:59.932 --> 10:01.851
is not gonna help
him relax.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.185
Take a deep breath.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.146
- [breathing deeply]

10:05.229 --> 10:07.023
Try to relax.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.149
It helps with memory.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.025
- I don't know if I can.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.818
- We're going to help you.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.654
Close your eyes

10:13.738 --> 10:16.866
and just let
yourself drift off.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.411
[loud music blaring]
- Ah!

10:24.999 --> 10:26.334
Hot!

10:28.127 --> 10:30.254
Oh!

10:30.338 --> 10:31.756
[moaning]

10:34.008 --> 10:34.717
What are you guys doing?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.218
- Soph!
What was that?

10:36.302 --> 10:38.262
- Jujitsu!

10:38.346 --> 10:38.888
- Shiatsu!

10:38.971 --> 10:41.057
Massage?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.808
What, did you really think
a jujitsu throw

10:42.892 --> 10:43.351
was going to
relax Daniel?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.978
- It relaxes me!

10:46.062 --> 10:46.979
- [sighing]

10:47.063 --> 10:49.357
Back to the drawing board.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.108
[phone beeps]
An hour and 42 minutes.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.866
- Guys...

10:58.949 --> 11:01.243
I'm gonna miss you two
most of all.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.579
Diego,
my best friend.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.249
Maddie, my best girl.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.545
I've done some thinking
and I've decided.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.922
When I'm gone I want
you two to be together.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.257
- Well--

11:15.341 --> 11:18.052
- This is how you
keep my memory alive.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.470
What do you say?

11:19.553 --> 11:19.845
- Yeah!
- Sure.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.265
If that's what you want.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.266
- Yeah, Maddie.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.811
- Anything for you, bro.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.110
- Sweat pants have
elastic waistbands,

11:34.193 --> 11:35.945
make the cards fly
into my hands.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.115
Junior?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.659
Jax Three?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.160
Jax Four?

11:43.244 --> 11:44.537
Anybody?

11:49.083 --> 11:49.625
- Hey...

11:49.708 --> 11:51.001
Where's Emma?

11:51.085 --> 11:55.464
- For the hundredth time,
that is not my name!

11:55.548 --> 11:57.466
- She's not gonna believe
what just happened.

11:57.550 --> 11:57.967
- Is it gonna help bring back
Daniel's memory?

11:58.050 --> 11:59.969
- No!

12:00.052 --> 12:00.636
- Well, then do
yourself a favor,

12:00.719 --> 12:02.555
tell her in an hour.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.682
Girl's in the zone.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.808
- It has to be in here!

12:05.891 --> 12:07.726
Come on, Hexie, give me
something I can use.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.648
- Hi, Jax.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.525
- Oh, hey, Daniel.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.902
- Listen, you don't
like me very much, do you?

12:16.986 --> 12:20.239
Well, let's see.
You came out of nowhere and--

12:20.322 --> 12:21.574
- Jax!

12:21.657 --> 12:23.325
Not the time.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.870
- You're not that bad.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.539
- Well, you won't
have to worry about me

12:28.622 --> 12:30.291
being around
much longer.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.417
I just want to
say goodbye.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.131
- I'm so sorry, Daniel.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.425
I can't imagine what you're
going through right now.

12:39.508 --> 12:40.301
- I need to say goodbye
to somebody else,

12:40.384 --> 12:43.345
but I need your help.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.182
You think you could
help me out?

12:46.265 --> 12:46.765
- Sure.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.737
All right,
I'm ready to go back.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.156
- Wait--
aren't you gonna--

13:02.239 --> 13:03.699
- I just wanted to see
them one more time

13:03.782 --> 13:06.368
before they
disappear forever.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.537
And remember them...

13:08.621 --> 13:10.122
just like this.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.167
- Okay.

13:17.046 --> 13:17.963
- [groaning]

13:18.047 --> 13:19.089
- Easy, Emm.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.341
Don't take it out
on Hex.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.467
- You're right.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.551
I'm sorry, Hex.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.055
This is my fault,
not yours.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.223
Do you forgive me?

13:30.726 --> 13:33.437
- Well, good luck, man...

13:33.521 --> 13:34.730
whatever happens.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.857
- Thanks.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.275
Aren't you
gonna come in?

13:38.359 --> 13:40.027
- Not right now.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.200
- Half an hour.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.576
- [sighing]

13:47.660 --> 13:50.329
- I'm so sorry, Daniel.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.372
I can't believe
I did this to--

13:51.455 --> 13:52.540
- It's okay.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.832
You thought you were
doing the right thing

13:53.916 --> 13:56.252
by bringing me back
to this life.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.587
So, how should I spend
my last half-hour?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.798
The beach, the pool?

14:00.881 --> 14:02.466
And don't say Sudoku, I get that
you really love Sudok--

14:02.550 --> 14:03.759
- Your house!

14:03.842 --> 14:04.969
- Huh?

14:05.052 --> 14:05.928
- Just come with me.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.429
This may be
our last chance.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.389
Take care of Hex,
will you?

14:08.472 --> 14:09.723
- On it.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.565
- Why are we here?

14:17.648 --> 14:18.732
We already came here once
and I didn't remember you.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.360
- But we didn't
go inside.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.279
Yeah, you said the people
here are kind of jerks.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.572
- That's true.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.116
But now's no time
to be afraid of jerks.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.747
- What's this for?

14:33.831 --> 14:34.790
[doorbell ringing]

14:34.873 --> 14:35.833
- You'll see.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.167
Just play along.

14:40.963 --> 14:41.505
- You again?

14:41.589 --> 14:42.339
What do you want?

14:42.423 --> 14:43.841
WOMAN: Who is it?

14:43.924 --> 14:47.303
- The annoying girl from
across the street again.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.512
WOMAN:
And what does she want?

14:48.596 --> 14:50.806
We don't have
any more cookies.

14:50.889 --> 14:53.183
- There's been reports of
gas leaks in the neighborhood!

14:53.267 --> 14:56.395
This inspector thinks it may
be coming from your house.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.273
- Why does he have a...

14:59.356 --> 15:00.482
Is that a snake?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.318
- This is Francois.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.028
He's a gas-sniffing boa.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.822
He can detect
leaks very well.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.490
What's that, boy?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.366
Methane gas?

15:09.450 --> 15:11.410
- Maria!

15:11.493 --> 15:12.494
We've got
a gas leak!

15:12.578 --> 15:14.455
Get out of the house!

15:14.538 --> 15:16.040
- Wait for me!

15:16.123 --> 15:17.166
Wait!

15:22.588 --> 15:26.133
- Hey, who are you with?

15:26.216 --> 15:27.301
Where's Jax?

15:27.384 --> 15:28.385
- I can go wherever I want
whenever I want.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.970
- Oh, yeah?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.889
Cool, then, uh,
I'll just text Jax

15:31.972 --> 15:34.683
and let him know
you're here... alone.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.934
- No!

15:36.018 --> 15:37.019
Just...

15:37.102 --> 15:39.480
Can I just hang here
for a few minutes?

15:39.563 --> 15:40.856
Just need
some time to myself.

15:40.939 --> 15:41.815
- Are you okay?

15:41.899 --> 15:43.734
- Yeah, I'm...

15:43.817 --> 15:45.861
[sobbing]

15:45.944 --> 15:47.196
Oh...

15:47.279 --> 15:52.159
That is the worst fake cry
I have ever seen.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.161
- It was pretty good.
- Oh, please.

15:54.244 --> 15:57.164
You know what, I have been
known to bring down

15:57.247 --> 16:01.210
an entire auto shop
of mechanics with my fake cry.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.712
Now, let's go.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.761
- Whoa!

16:10.844 --> 16:12.012
What's that?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.097
- Uh, it's the, uh...

16:15.641 --> 16:18.644
I guess it's okay
for you to know.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.521
This is the Hexoren,
AKA Hex.

16:20.604 --> 16:24.692
AKA Hexie, AKA my pal.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.902
- You're friends
with a book?

16:26.985 --> 16:29.238
- This is not
any ordinary book.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.282
Practically every spell
in the magic realm is in here.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.493
Plus, he's an
excellent dancer.

16:36.870 --> 16:37.621
- So cool!

16:37.705 --> 16:40.624
I mean, for a book.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.543
Okay, you win.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.294
But can you buy me
a slice of pizza?

16:44.378 --> 16:47.464
There's no food in the house
since Dad and Jax just...

16:47.548 --> 16:48.507
when they're hungry.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.050
- Fine, but wait here.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.269
[zipper dragging]

17:09.903 --> 17:11.488
- Remember all the good times
we had in here?

17:11.571 --> 17:13.115
Remember our
anniversary dinner,

17:13.198 --> 17:15.576
when the T3 dumped
orange goo on you?

17:16.785 --> 17:17.786
Of course
you don't remember.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.997
It didn't look
anything like this.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.039
Go back out.

17:21.123 --> 17:21.999
- Why?

17:22.082 --> 17:22.249
- Just do it.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.128
When things look right
all will be clear,

17:27.212 --> 17:28.088
get these people's
stuff out of here.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.644
- Hey, guys, uh...

17:42.728 --> 17:44.188
You guys hanging out
or something?

17:44.271 --> 17:45.981
- Yup.
- No.

17:46.064 --> 17:49.359
I found this little troublemaker
by herself at The Seven.

17:49.443 --> 17:53.572
Thought I'd just bring
her back where she belongs.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.491
- Well, thanks.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.159
- That's it?

17:57.242 --> 17:58.160
No reward?

17:58.243 --> 17:59.870
- Uh...

18:00.829 --> 18:01.747
Here.
- What?

18:01.830 --> 18:04.041
- Buy yourself something nice.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.167
- Okay, you live
in this house

18:05.250 --> 18:08.045
and this is what
you offer me as a reward.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.172
Wha--no way,
I'm keeping it now.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.509
- Is Emma still
at The Seven?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.177
- No.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.470
She went over to Daniel's
for one last-ditch effort.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.347
- Hmm.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.140
I better go
check up on her.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.725
You stay here.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.481
- Hey!

18:34.905 --> 18:37.199
Don't worry, Hexie,
I'll bring you back

18:37.282 --> 18:39.535
when you help me learn
how to be a real witch.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.708
[doorbell ringing]

18:48.043 --> 18:49.503
[knocking]

18:54.466 --> 18:56.885
- Emma?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.054
Are you here?

18:59.137 --> 18:59.263
Hello?

19:02.724 --> 19:04.143
- Emma, you don't
have to do this.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.103
- But there's still
a minute left!

19:06.186 --> 19:07.396
We can't give up!

19:07.479 --> 19:10.357
- Calm down, it's over.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.109
If this is gonna be
my last minute on earth

19:12.192 --> 19:15.571
I don't want to spend it
watching you clean out a garage.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.905
[sighing]

19:18.657 --> 19:21.577
I know you feel bad,
but you shouldn't.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.370
I don't see somebody who
did something bad to me.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.831
I see someone who did everything
she could to help me.

19:25.914 --> 19:26.707
- It wasn't enough.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.292
- Maybe not.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.419
But we must have been
pretty good friends

19:30.502 --> 19:33.130
for you to fight so
hard to try to save me.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.216
I really wish
I did know you.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.968
You're a great person.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.430
Will you make sure Billy
makes it home all right?

19:41.513 --> 19:43.932
- What?

19:44.016 --> 19:44.433
Oh...

19:44.516 --> 19:46.435
Sure.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.688
Daniel, we were
more than friends.

19:49.771 --> 19:50.981
You were my first love!

19:51.064 --> 19:52.316
I cared about you more
than anything in the world!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.827
- Daniel,
what are you doing?

20:03.911 --> 20:06.121
I thought it might
do the trick.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.456
- No!

20:07.539 --> 20:09.583
I'm sorry,
but I'm with Jax.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.754
- Is this the end?

20:13.837 --> 20:15.172
- I don't know.

20:25.223 --> 20:28.310
[liquid sloshing]

20:28.393 --> 20:29.937
Emma.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.230
I remember you.
I remember.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.487
Um, you're not gonna
believe this,

20:38.570 --> 20:40.530
but I think we're
about to get pranked.

20:42.991 --> 20:46.161
- Jax, when did you--

20:46.244 --> 20:47.496
[kids laughing]

20:49.331 --> 20:50.707
- You've been hosed!

20:50.791 --> 20:52.334
- Drive-by hosing!

20:52.417 --> 20:54.044
[laughter]
- [shouting]

20:54.127 --> 20:55.545
BOTH: T3!
[laughing]

20:57.923 --> 20:59.841
- It worked!

20:59.925 --> 21:01.176
Daniel remembers me!

21:06.640 --> 21:07.849
Are you okay?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.101
- Yeah...

21:09.184 --> 21:11.979
It's all just kind of
rushing in kind of fast.

21:12.062 --> 21:12.312
Whoa.

21:15.732 --> 21:17.901
Billy?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.236
What's happening
to Billy?

21:19.319 --> 21:19.820
Why is that happening?

21:19.903 --> 21:21.279
Make it stop.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.740
- I don't think
I know any spells

21:23.824 --> 21:24.992
to stop snakes from fading away.

21:25.075 --> 21:25.826
- Billy!

21:25.909 --> 21:27.202
Try something--
anything!

21:27.285 --> 21:28.203
- Uh...

21:28.286 --> 21:29.538
From this world
you must not veer,

21:29.621 --> 21:30.497
stay with us,
don't disappear.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.877
- Where did he go?

21:35.961 --> 21:38.255
He's not from this life.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.425
He didn't belong here.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.512
- Danny, I'm...

21:45.595 --> 21:46.471
I'm sorry.

21:50.851 --> 21:51.768
What's wrong?

21:51.852 --> 21:52.978
- I just remembered
everything.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.313
- That's great!

21:55.397 --> 21:57.190
- I remembered how I ended up
in my other life.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.278
You chose Jax over me.
