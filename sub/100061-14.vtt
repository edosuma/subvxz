Good to meet you.

Mr. Grover, sir.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.446
Yeah.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.114
If I could make a suggestion...

00:31.197 --> 00:32.449
I haven't even
swung a club yet.

You're already making

everyone you're law enforcement.

Wait just a minute.
Before you start

01:21.247 --> 01:24.000
asking for membership
cards and such,

01:24.083 --> 01:26.503
you ought to know that my wife
won this round for me

fair and square

01:29.214 --> 01:31.883
Of course. And we're very

Have you called HPD?

01:56.616 --> 01:59.494
I was about to do so, sir,
when we were made aware

01:59.577 --> 02:01.704
that you were
on the premises.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.872
Management thought
it would be more prudent

02:02.956 --> 02:04.374
to seek your assistance.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.709
Oh, did they, now?

02:04.457 --> 02:06.709
Since we don't yet know

02:06.793 --> 02:10.380
if it's an accident or some kind
of equipment malfunction,

02:10.463 --> 02:12.382
management is hoping
this can be handled

02:12.465 --> 02:15.677
with the appropriate level
of discretion and sensitivity.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.054
As I'm sure you can appreciate,

02:18.137 --> 02:20.390
the club has a reputation

Oh, I'm as discrete and
sensitive as the next guy,

02:22.642 --> 02:24.727
but not for nothing, you do have

02:24.811 --> 02:26.437
a dead body
in your cryo-chamber.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.231
(exhales)

02:28.314 --> 02:30.066
Okay.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.570
Tell me something,

02:33.653 --> 02:35.405
do you know if anybody
entered this room

02:35.488 --> 02:38.074
while this gentleman was
receiving his treatment?

02:38.157 --> 02:39.492
Not that I am aware of.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.537
And for obvious reasons,
we can't have cameras here,

02:42.620 --> 02:45.123
so there's no way to check.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.416
Why do you ask?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.376
Come here.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.295
You see these dents

02:50.378 --> 02:53.089
on the inside
of the door?

02:53.173 --> 02:56.426
This guy was trying to bang
his way out of this thing.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.052
And these bruises

02:58.136 --> 03:00.597
all over his hands
tell the same story.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.558
Maybe the locking mechanism
malfunctioned,

03:03.641 --> 03:05.435
trapping him inside.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.437
Doubtful.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.939
Look at these handles
on the outside of the door.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.525
They both have indentations.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.904
Someone barred the door shut.

to lighten up.

about, uh, Mrs. Wo Fat?

04:26.432 --> 04:29.143
I, uh, reached out
to Interpol.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.146
There were no hits
on any of Daiyu Mei's aliases,

04:32.230 --> 04:34.357

she's laying low

Okay, well, hmm.

04:37.735 --> 04:38.987
Haven't heard back from Adam?

04:39.070 --> 04:40.363
Nope.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.363
No.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.198
Left him messages.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.198
Yeah, I left him messages, too.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.200
I'm gonna keep leaving him
messages until he calls me back.

04:44.283 --> 04:45.368
Yeah, well,
assuming that happens,

04:45.451 --> 04:47.203
he's got a lot
of explaining to do.

DANNY: Hi.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.334
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.504
It's okay.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.504
Uh, are we expecting
Charlie's mother?

04:56.587 --> 04:59.382
Uh, no, no. She's not coming
today, unfortunately.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.383
STEVE:
I am here, though.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.385
I'm Steve McGarrett.
I'm his, uh, his partner.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.761
We work together.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.055
I see. Uh, typically,
these meetings

05:06.139 --> 05:07.432
are only open to family.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.351
He's family. He's, uh,
basically Charlie's uncle.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.728
Thank you.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.728
Thanks.

05:11.811 --> 05:12.729
STEVE:
I'm also, uh,

05:12.812 --> 05:14.814
his emotional support friend.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.235
Okay, then.

05:19.318 --> 05:21.237
Okay.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.655
So, I called
this meeting

05:22.739 --> 05:24.407
because...

05:22.739 --> 05:24.407
DANNY: Yeah, no,
I know, I know. Um...

05:24.490 --> 05:28.411
Another kid punched, uh,
Charlie, so, uh,

05:28.494 --> 05:30.580
I guess the-the question is,
what-what are you guys, uh,

05:30.663 --> 05:32.248
what are you gonna do?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.248
Yes.

05:32.331 --> 05:33.416
That is the question.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.585
And if this were
an isolated incident,

05:35.668 --> 05:37.587
I'd be giving you a
very different answer.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.547
So it's not-- What do you mean,
an isolated incident?

05:39.630 --> 05:40.381
This has happened before? What?

05:40.465 --> 05:41.924
When the teacher spoke
with Charlie

05:42.008 --> 05:43.217
after today's altercation,
he admitted

05:43.301 --> 05:44.594
that he and Blake
have had friction

05:44.677 --> 05:46.596
for quite some time.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.596
What kind of friction?

05:46.679 --> 05:47.889
DANNY:
Steve.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.889
Sorry.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.225
What kind of friction?

05:51.309 --> 05:54.604
Blake's been engaging in all
the typical bullying behaviors.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.606
Uh, intimidation, name-calling.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.484
And recently, he started
taking Charlie's things.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.526
His calculator,

06:00.610 --> 06:02.445
his Nintendo Switch.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.614
His Nintendo Switch. Yeah,
he told me that he lost that.

06:04.697 --> 06:05.656
I don't know why he'd lie to me.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.908
Don't feel bad.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.619
Kids are often afraid to come
forward about being bullied.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.705
But the school takes
this issue very seriously.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.625
Okay, great. So what-- again,
what's the school gonna do?

06:15.708 --> 06:19.253
Well, we've found the only cure
is conversation.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.590
Between both kids and
both sets of parents.

06:22.673 --> 06:25.134
So are the-- Blake's parents,
they coming in, or...?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.969
I got a call
just before I came in.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.013
And, unfortunately,
Mr. and Mrs. Tatum

06:29.097 --> 06:30.932
will not be able
to make it in today.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.183
So, then what are we doing here?

06:32.266 --> 06:33.601
I mean, if they're not
gonna show up,

06:33.684 --> 06:35.645
how are we gonna have
a-a conversation?

06:36.562 --> 06:37.688
Okay. Uh, look...

06:37.772 --> 06:39.565
Wait, hold on.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.565
No, no, no. It's fine.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.484
Um, I appreciate, um,

06:41.567 --> 06:43.152
you calling me in,
but I-I will, um,

06:43.236 --> 06:44.946
I'll handle it from here.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.948
Okay? Come on. Let's go.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.948
Yep. (clears throat)

06:47.031 --> 06:49.659
Okay. And thank you. Uh...

06:47.031 --> 06:49.659
Oh.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.702
This was, uh, very productive.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.663
Was it?

06:53.746 --> 06:54.622
Not really.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.707
Thank you.

I'm sure you're still asleep,
but, uh...

07:04.715 --> 07:07.009
I just got called up
for reserve duty.

07:07.093 --> 07:10.847
I'm on my way to Dillingham,
so by the time you get this,

07:10.930 --> 07:12.890
I'll be wheels up.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.518
I don't know
how long I'll be gone,

07:15.601 --> 07:18.146
and I'm not allowed to get
in contact while I'm away,

07:18.229 --> 07:20.690
but I'll call you
as soon as I can.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.317
And, um, Tani,

07:23.401 --> 07:25.570
I'm looking forward to picking
up from where we left off.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.559
GROVER:
Officer Tani Rey, good morning.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.727
Is it?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.354
Because I'm at work
and nobody's here.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.398
Well, that's because Steve

08:02.481 --> 08:03.858
had to help Danny with something

08:03.941 --> 08:06.068
and Quinn has got
a deposition in court,

08:06.152 --> 08:07.069
and I'm sure you heard about

08:07.153 --> 08:08.571
Junior getting called up, right?

08:08.654 --> 08:09.989
Uh, yeah, I did.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.408
And where are you?

08:10.072 --> 08:12.408
Well, I'm at

08:12.491 --> 08:14.577
the Ali'i Aina golf club.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.245
How lovely.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.206
Well, it ain't that lovely.
I managed to catch myself

08:18.289 --> 08:19.373
a homicide while I've been here.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.959
Really? Okay, well, in that
case, give me the address.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.630
Well, um, we kind of got this.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.757
I'm getting helped out
by the head of security here,

08:27.840 --> 08:31.093
and we're, uh, trying to keep
a light footprint.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.595
A light footprint?

08:32.678 --> 08:34.764
Yeah, I get it. You're trying
not to upset the guests?

08:34.847 --> 08:35.973
Something like that, yeah.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.434
Wait a sec. Is this the same

08:38.517 --> 08:41.020
fancy-pants golf club that
you've been trying to get into

08:41.103 --> 08:43.231
for, like, ever?

08:43.314 --> 08:44.982
What the hell's that got
to do with anything?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.609
I'm just saying.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.611
Well, instead of just saying,
why don't you get

08:48.694 --> 08:51.572
to just doing
and make yourself useful?

08:51.656 --> 08:53.991
Can you run financials and, uh,
phone records on our vic?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.618
All righty, then.
Okay, who is this guy?

08:55.701 --> 08:58.829
His name is Chuck Tsao.
He's 44 years old.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.666
Been a member here at this club
since 2009.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.626
On it.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.626
Great. Keep me posted.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.796
Dr. No. What you got for me?

09:06.879 --> 09:09.632
Well, it appears Mr. Tsao
arrived at 8:15 a.m.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.134
for his regular
cryotherapy session.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.471
His killer barred the door shut
and then maxed out the timer.

09:15.554 --> 09:16.847
As a result,
Mr. Tsao was subjected

09:16.931 --> 09:18.641
to a negative-200-degree
chilling blast

09:18.724 --> 09:21.769
of evaporating liquid nitrogen
for over ten minutes.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.771
Ooh. Minus 200?

09:23.854 --> 09:25.189
Damn, that's cold.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.816
NOELANI:
Yeah. And excruciating.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.526
At extreme temperatures
like that,

09:28.609 --> 09:31.445
things go from bad to worse
with remarkable speed.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.363
Well, I have
to get Mr. Tsao

09:32.446 --> 09:34.991
back to the lab,
but it's going to be hours

09:35.074 --> 09:37.243
before he thaws out enough
for an autopsy.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.786
All right.
Well, thanks for your help.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.788
And, uh, do me a favor, just
take the service entrance.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.665
We don't want to
scare the members.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.793
Right. Got it. Let's go.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.507
Captain Grover.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.551
As requested, here is
the sign-in sheet

09:53.634 --> 09:55.011
from the front desk.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.346
According to our system,
167 members

09:57.430 --> 10:00.349
were on the premises
at the time of the murder.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.644
167-- well,
we got a suspect pool.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.646
It's an Olympic-sized
suspect pool, but...

10:05.730 --> 10:07.898
And a lot of VIPs
on that list.

10:07.982 --> 10:12.278
We need to tread carefully,
not to step on anyone's toes.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.864
167 people?

10:14.947 --> 10:17.408
That's a hell of a lot
of toes to avoid.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.535
Let's get to work.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.797
(indistinct chatter)

10:52.610 --> 10:54.445
(dance music playing inside)

10:56.280 --> 10:57.823
Ariko.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.244
It's good to see you.

11:03.662 --> 11:05.206
Thank you for meeting me.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.875
I expected to see
your recent problems

11:07.958 --> 11:10.586
weighing heavily
on you, but...

11:10.669 --> 11:13.255
you look as handsome
as always.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.551
So, you heard what happened?

11:17.635 --> 11:20.930
That Kenji now has
what was once Masuda-san's?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.098
Yes.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.059
Look, I need a favor.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.938
You still have the ear
of important men?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.773
Ears...

11:30.856 --> 11:32.566
and other things.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.237
I need a sit-down with the
<i>kumicho</i> of the Tokyo syndicate.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.657
I cannot help you with that.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.575
You can't or you won't?

11:41.659 --> 11:44.954
What you ask is not
within my power to promise.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.832
(scoffs) I've come
a long way, okay?

11:48.874 --> 11:51.585
And I am sorry
for your wasted journey,

11:51.669 --> 11:55.256
but the boss will never agree
to sit down with someone

11:55.339 --> 11:57.466
who carries
a law enforcement badge.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.135
I don't have that
badge anymore.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.594
I gave it up.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.512
Because you quit?

12:01.595 --> 12:04.932
Or because you want people
to think you did?

12:05.015 --> 12:07.309
I'm through with that life.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.727
And that's the truth.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.983
But if you need
another reason...

12:14.066 --> 12:17.486
tell the<i> kumicho</i> to see me
out of respect for my father.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.617
I can ask.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.619
But that is all.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.830
That is all I need.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.792
Thank you, Ariko.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.964
Oh, and, Adam...

12:38.382 --> 12:41.677
Be careful where you walk
while you are in Tokyo.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.971
Kenji has many loyal men here.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.523
♪ ♪

13:03.782 --> 13:05.826
Okay, what do we got here?

13:07.578 --> 13:09.497
A wallet.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.667
A phone.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.211
Locked. No surprise there.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.837
Oh.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.048
(exhales) What is this?

13:19.131 --> 13:20.966
Oh.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.260
Hello.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.803
Well...

13:23.344 --> 13:24.803
Ooh.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.223
That's quite a wad
of spending cash.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.725
Think it's safe to
assume that Mr. Tsao

13:29.808 --> 13:32.520
liked to lay the occasional bet
on his golf games.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.396
Apparently,
for some of the members,

13:34.480 --> 13:36.565
the joy of the game
isn't enough.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.858
Yeah. Sad, ain't it?

13:37.942 --> 13:40.861
Ah. Look at this.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.197
This is what you call
the classic, uh,

13:43.280 --> 13:44.907
golfer's dirty trick.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.076
See, you cut a hole
in your pocket,

13:47.159 --> 13:49.078
and you carry a
ball in there.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.038
That way, when you lose
your ball in the rough,

13:51.121 --> 13:53.249
you can just drop a new one
through your pant leg

13:53.332 --> 13:54.583
and get yourself
a better spot.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.752
A gambler who was also a cheat.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.004
What's this?

14:00.965 --> 14:02.716
Chuck seems to have
printed out some...

14:02.800 --> 14:05.511
old golf scores here.

14:05.594 --> 14:08.264
Why is that odd?
I mean, from what I've seen,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.724
most golfers are obsessed
with their scores.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.809
Yeah, they are.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.811
But it seems
like Mr. Tsao

14:13.894 --> 14:15.604
may have cheated
the wrong person.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.022
First of all,

14:17.106 --> 14:19.733
these are scores from a
club in Phoenix, Arizona.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.610
And secondly,

14:21.694 --> 14:23.112
I looked through
all these pages,

14:23.195 --> 14:24.905
didn't see Chuck's name once.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.825
But I did see another name
on every single page.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.785
Right here.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.121
Raul Diaz.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.247
Ever heard of him?

14:33.330 --> 14:35.416
No, he's not
a member of this club.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.459
Huh.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.754
Then why, I wonder,
was our vic so obsessed

14:40.838 --> 14:44.008
with Mr. Diaz's scores?

14:50.723 --> 14:51.765
You all right?

14:51.849 --> 14:53.767
No, I'm-I'm not all right.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.103
I just found out my kid has been
being tormented for weeks

14:56.186 --> 14:58.647
and I didn't know about it.
So, no, I'm not all right.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.067
Look, Charlie's probably, uh,
a little embarrassed, Danny.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.152
Wh-What's embarrassing?
I mean, (stammers)

15:03.235 --> 15:04.445
you think he did
something wrong?

15:04.528 --> 15:05.446
No, what are you
talking about?

15:05.529 --> 15:06.322
Of course not.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.322
(mutters)

15:06.405 --> 15:07.948
Getting bullied like that,
it carries

15:08.032 --> 15:09.658
a lot of shame for a kid.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.658
It does?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.827
Yes, it does. Yes.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.827
How would you know?

15:11.910 --> 15:13.787
The first few months
when I was in military school,

15:13.871 --> 15:14.788
I was bullied, all right?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.498
Pretty relentlessly.
It sucked.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.709
The kids were brutal.
I got to tell you,

15:18.792 --> 15:19.627
in all honesty,
it actually toughened me up.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.962
The whole experience
made me stronger.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.339
I'm gonna put Charlie in karate.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.673
That's not
what I'm say...

15:24.757 --> 15:25.883
You know what I'm talking about.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.217
It made me tougher mentally.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.844
DANNY:
Fine. That, too.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.179
Can you make a right, please?

15:30.262 --> 15:31.263
All I'm saying,
Danny,

15:31.347 --> 15:32.348
is that, always,

15:32.431 --> 15:33.891
there's a story
to a kid who bullies.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.851
There's a reason why they do it.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.811
Okay. Then I would be happy
to hear that reason

15:37.895 --> 15:39.688
if those people would've
shown up to the meeting today.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.690
I would've been compassionate,
I-I don't know. I would've done

15:41.774 --> 15:42.900
whatever you want me to do,
but they didn't show up.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.902
What do you want me to do?

15:42.983 --> 15:44.902
All I want you
to do is know,

15:44.985 --> 15:47.029
uh, the whole situation
before you go off half-cocked,

15:47.112 --> 15:48.197
doing something crazy

15:48.280 --> 15:49.740
like this,
like we're about to do.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.825
Silver Camry. That's him, okay?

15:51.909 --> 15:54.036
You absolutely sure
you want to do this?

15:51.909 --> 15:54.036
That's it, it's the right...

15:54.119 --> 15:55.871
I... What did I...

15:54.119 --> 15:55.871
Don't yell at me.
I'm just asking.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.498
What did I just say 19 times?

15:55.954 --> 15:57.498
I'm... asking you.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.875
Can you just do what I ask you
to do one time in the world?

15:57.581 --> 15:59.875
Fine. Yep. Mm-hmm.

15:59.958 --> 16:02.544
I'll put these lights on.

15:59.958 --> 16:02.544
(siren blares)

16:09.134 --> 16:10.386
DANNY: Hey.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.386
Hey.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.221
Is there a problem?
Was I driving too fast?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.515
No. You, uh,
you Blake Tatum's father?

16:14.598 --> 16:15.933
I am.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.933
Okay.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.685
Uh, follow me. Come on.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.938
Come on.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.069
(cell phone ringing)

16:27.152 --> 16:28.862
All right, Tani, I've been
waiting for some good news.

16:28.946 --> 16:29.863
I did a full sweep

16:29.947 --> 16:31.990
on your victim Chuck,
and nothing jumped out

16:32.074 --> 16:34.702
as far as his phone records
or financials.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.078
How about his score cards?

16:36.161 --> 16:36.912
Ah, yes.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.872
The mysterious Raul Diaz.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.042
So, he was the golf pro
at this club in Arizona.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.794
He doesn't work there anymore.
I couldn't find

16:43.877 --> 16:46.213
a current address,
but I'm texting you this photo.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.423
GROVER:
Okay, thanks.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.424
(phone dings)

16:48.507 --> 16:50.217
This is, uh,

16:50.300 --> 16:52.052
Raul Diaz.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.930
He was a golf pro
at a club in Phoenix.

16:55.013 --> 16:55.931
You ever seen him?

16:56.014 --> 16:57.266
He's a member at the club.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.769
But his name is not Raul Diaz.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.104
It's Ed Ramirez.

17:11.029 --> 17:14.116
Are you serious?
I'll need a wedge for this.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.619
Idiot.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.164
You really shouldn't be talking
to your caddy that way, man.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.624
Especially when he's right.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.126
Oh.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.961
I'm sorry.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.838
Did I break your concentration?

17:29.214 --> 17:31.633
GROVER:
<i>So, here's what we know, Ed.</i>

17:31.717 --> 17:33.469
ZEV:
Or should we call you Raul?

17:33.552 --> 17:36.472
Oh, yeah, that's right.
All these names, so confusing.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.432
Tell you what,
why don't we just call you

17:38.515 --> 17:40.976
Prime Suspect in the Murder
of Chuck Tsao. Good for you?

17:41.059 --> 17:42.478
Whoa, whoa, what?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.146
Chuck is dead?

17:44.229 --> 17:47.024
Well, that's news to me.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.024
Is it?

17:47.107 --> 17:49.276
Because here's
how it sounds to me.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.111
Chuck was losing
piles of money to you

17:51.195 --> 17:52.821
out here on this golf course.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.656
Despite the fact
that he was cheating.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.033
But because
a cheat knows a cheat,

17:56.116 --> 17:58.202
he did some digging into you
and he found out

17:58.285 --> 17:59.828
that you're actually a pro

17:59.912 --> 18:01.663
from Arizona.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.457
You've been hustling
from club to club,

18:03.540 --> 18:05.959
playing under different names
and sandbagging your handicap

18:06.043 --> 18:08.003
to take money off
unsuspecting golfers.

18:08.086 --> 18:11.173
Mr. Tsao could have exposed you
to those players,

18:11.256 --> 18:12.341
to the country clubs,

18:12.424 --> 18:14.259
to the police,
so you...

18:14.343 --> 18:15.969
you killed him.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.971
Okay. Okay, hold on.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.474
Yes, I hustle a game
now and then, I'll admit that.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.851
But I swear I didn't kill Chuck.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.851
Where were you

18:22.935 --> 18:25.687
between the hours of 8:00 a.m.
and 9:00 a.m. this morning?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.523
I was having breakfast
with the rest of my foursome.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.858
Th-they can confirm it.
I never left the table.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.068
We need their names.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.945
You need to understand
something.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.029
Chuck was a degenerate gambler.

18:34.112 --> 18:36.532
Maybe the worst I've seen,
and I've seen my share.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.076
If I was to guess, I'd say
that's what got him killed.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.327
So, are you telling us that

18:40.410 --> 18:43.038
you weren't the only person
that Chuck was gambling with?

18:43.121 --> 18:44.081
You kidding?

18:44.164 --> 18:46.166
The guy had a serious problem.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.709
He'd lose 25K on the course,

18:47.793 --> 18:50.128
then go straight to the
poker table and lose 25 more.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.048
And he never
had a problem paying?

18:53.131 --> 18:55.050
Actually, never.
He was always on time.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.385
In fact,
he usually settled in cash

18:56.468 --> 18:58.303
over a whiskey
at the end of the night.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.725
Don't move.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.065
So, Chuck's losing
upwards of 50K every night,

19:10.148 --> 19:12.734
and he's paying at the
club's bar like he's got

19:12.818 --> 19:15.571
a personal ATM machine on
the premises or something.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.739
Yeah, but your friend
on the phone,

19:17.823 --> 19:20.075
she said his financials
looked normal.

19:20.158 --> 19:23.036
She would've noticed
he was moving that kind of money

19:23.120 --> 19:25.205
in and out of his
personal banking account.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.708
Then where the hell was Chuck
getting all that cash from?

19:34.214 --> 19:36.383
LUKE:
So... pulling me over

19:36.466 --> 19:38.343
and-and bringing me
out here, I mean...

19:40.012 --> 19:41.597
Don't you think this
is a little extreme?

19:41.680 --> 19:44.933
No. No, I-I don't think
it's extreme at all.

19:45.017 --> 19:45.934
What do you think?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.102
I mean, I...

19:47.185 --> 19:48.979
He doesn't think
it's extreme, either.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.105
What-what I do think

19:50.188 --> 19:52.816
is extreme is-is
your son's behavior,

19:52.900 --> 19:54.943
and your behavior,
as well.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.571
I mean, you didn't think
it was important to show up

19:57.654 --> 19:58.989
to the school
this afternoon?

19:59.072 --> 20:00.782
Are-are you one of those people
who don't think

20:00.866 --> 20:02.117
that the rules apply to you?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.453
I mean, that would...
that would explain

20:04.536 --> 20:06.580
why your son acts
the way he does.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.082
STEVE:
Whoa, hold on, hold on.
We're not here to put you

20:09.166 --> 20:11.752
or your son on trial.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.752
You want to tell him that?

20:11.835 --> 20:12.961
Um, look, we're just
here because we want

20:13.045 --> 20:15.130
to figure out what's going on
between Blake and Charlie.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.257
I want to know why you
didn't think it was important

20:17.341 --> 20:18.800
to show up at that meeting.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.969
I am under a lot of stress.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.972
I didn't realize how
bad things had gotten

20:24.056 --> 20:25.599
with Blake.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.017
Now you know.
Your son is a bully.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.102
What are you gonna do about it?

20:27.100 --> 20:29.102
He's...

20:29.186 --> 20:30.312
What are<i> we</i> gonna
do about it, no?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.856
I mean, isn't that why we
are here? To find a solution?

20:32.940 --> 20:35.025
I-I'm sorry I didn't
make that meeting, man.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.654
I-I-I had an appointment
with my attorneys.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.655
I mean, they charge
$250 an hour

20:39.738 --> 20:40.697
whether you're there or not,
you know, so, uh...

20:40.781 --> 20:43.992
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.203
Uh, Blake's mom and I,
we're getting a divorce.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.832
I'm really sorry
to hear that.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.669
It has been...
Ah, man, it has been

20:53.752 --> 20:56.713
so toxic,
and it has been so bad,

20:56.797 --> 20:59.174
and we've really...
we've really been trying

20:59.257 --> 21:00.509
to keep Blake
out of it.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.802
I get it.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.762
That's, uh... that's tough.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.347
Yeah. And, uh,
look, man, I-I...

21:05.430 --> 21:06.807
I'm not... I'm not
making excuses

21:06.890 --> 21:10.143
for-for what my kid has done
and how he's acted.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.062
DANNY:
I get it. I-I went
through something similar,

21:12.145 --> 21:13.146
see, but I had a thing

21:13.230 --> 21:14.982
with my oldest.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.900
She started acting crazy...

21:15.065 --> 21:16.900
Yeah.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.027
doing things out of character,
so I understand, it sucks.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.154
Yeah. It sucks.
It does.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.864
DANNY:
It's not easy.
I wish you luck.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.326
Look, you'll, uh,
you'll figure it out.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.326
Thank you.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.203
I appreciate that,
and I'm sorry about

21:28.286 --> 21:29.871
what's happened
with Charlie.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.541
And I'll-I'll talk
to Blake. I'm sorry.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.210
STEVE:
Hold-hold on.
One second.

21:35.293 --> 21:37.212
I-I literally just watched
you guys walk through that

21:37.295 --> 21:39.089
and figure it out.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.217
There's no reason your kids
can't do the same thing.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.596
Am I wrong?

21:53.186 --> 21:54.062
ZEV:
<i>What makes you think</i>

21:54.146 --> 21:56.231
Chuck kept his cash
in his whiskey locker?

21:56.314 --> 21:57.649
Remember the immortal words

21:57.733 --> 21:59.192
of Raul Diaz.

21:59.276 --> 22:02.446
He said, "Our vic always settled
by the end of the day,"

22:02.529 --> 22:05.240
in cash, over what?
A whiskey.

22:05.323 --> 22:08.076
Now, he only had 10K
in his spa locker.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.120
So it stands to reason
he stashed it someplace else.

22:10.203 --> 22:13.123
Ergo...

22:10.203 --> 22:13.123
Uh, I apologize.
There's a dress code

22:13.206 --> 22:14.750
to the whiskey lounge.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.750
Oh.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.877
Gentlemen are required
to wear a jacket.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.549
Since management
has emphasized...

22:24.551 --> 22:26.011
...discretion...

22:27.929 --> 22:31.516
Is that a member's jacket?

22:27.929 --> 22:31.516
Yes, it is.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.269
I thought you were gonna
find some ratty jacket

22:34.352 --> 22:35.979
at a lost-and-found.

22:37.355 --> 22:39.941
Zev... do you have any idea

22:40.025 --> 22:42.194
how long I've waited
to put one of these things on?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.281
How do I look?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.281
Like you were
born to wear it.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.450
Wait, whoa-whoa-whoa,
hold on a second.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.618
I-I want to
take a selfie.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.119
My wife will get a
kick out of this.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.999
Okay. (chuckles)

22:56.083 --> 22:57.959
Come here.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.629
Well, hot dog.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.256
They sure did this place up
right, didn't they?

23:03.340 --> 23:04.716
Here's Chuck's locker.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.309
J. Darby 25
single malt.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.394
Mr. Tsao had good taste.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.605
Yeah. Whoa.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.483
I heard of light beer,
but light scotch?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.987
Either Chuck drank up

23:26.071 --> 23:28.406
all this fine
whiskey, or...

23:29.866 --> 23:31.576
Show me the money.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.329
What did I tell you?

23:38.750 --> 23:41.878
GROVER:
Tani, it's Lou.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.878
Lou, how's it coming?

23:41.962 --> 23:43.672
Well, so far, everything's
coming up dollars.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.174
Didn't you just tell me
that when you ran

23:46.258 --> 23:48.301
Chuck's financials,
they all came back clean?

23:48.385 --> 23:51.304
His personal accounts were,
yeah, but since we last spoke,

23:51.388 --> 23:52.639
I dug into his businesses.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.558
Now, I'm just starting
to make some headway,

23:54.641 --> 23:57.227
but tell me, what do
these places have in common?

23:57.310 --> 24:02.149
A used car lot, a seedy bar,
multiple pawn shops,

24:02.232 --> 24:03.900
and a check cashing place.

24:03.984 --> 24:06.987
Well, they're all
high-volume cash businesses.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.572
Ideal for
money laundering.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.198
TANI:
You're exactly right.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.992
You should look
for multiple titles

24:12.075 --> 24:13.994
of ownership, few creditors,

24:14.077 --> 24:16.830
and little to no available
public information.

24:16.913 --> 24:20.709
Uh, yeah. Okay, will do,
mystery man on the phone.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.377
All right, I'm gonna
get Duke on this.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.045
We need to get HPD over to

24:24.129 --> 24:27.382
<i>all of Chuck's businesses</i>
<i>right now.</i>

24:27.465 --> 24:30.218
<i>I want them to dig up</i>
<i>everything they can find</i>

24:30.302 --> 24:32.888
<i>from accounting ledgers,</i>
<i>hard drives,</i>

24:32.971 --> 24:35.223
<i>dummy receipts, cooked books...</i>

24:35.307 --> 24:37.350
<i>Now, they're not gonna be</i>
<i>all out in the open,</i>

24:37.434 --> 24:40.270
<i>so the guys are gonna</i>
<i>have to get creative.</i>

24:55.035 --> 24:57.412
(dialing phone)

24:57.495 --> 24:59.456
(phone rings)

24:57.495 --> 24:59.456
What do you say, Duke?

24:59.539 --> 25:00.749
We just finished
hitting the last

25:00.832 --> 25:02.083
of Mr. Tsao's businesses.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.753
As of now, the count
is over 120 million.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.088
Dollars?

25:04.836 --> 25:07.088
DUKE:
That's right.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.758
And we still have more vans
filled with cash coming in.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.219
Well, just what in the hell
was this guy all mixed up in?

25:12.302 --> 25:14.304
About that-- I had CSU

25:14.387 --> 25:15.472
examine the bills,

25:15.555 --> 25:16.973
and they found
duplicate patterns

25:17.057 --> 25:18.141
in the numerical sequences.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.894
So you're saying the money
was counterfeit?

25:18.225 --> 25:20.894
Yes, sir.

25:20.977 --> 25:23.230
We got confirmation of that
just a few minutes ago.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.105
Thanks, Duke. Let me know

25:24.189 --> 25:26.691
if you find anything else.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.691
You got it.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.278
You've got a theory.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.113
You're damn right
I got a theory.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.449
And I'll bet you all that
funny money we just found

25:34.532 --> 25:35.367
that our vic
was laundering money

25:35.450 --> 25:37.827
for a counterfeiting ring.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.827
Makes sense.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.497
Now, let's see. What else
do we know about this guy?

25:40.580 --> 25:41.957
He's a degenerate gambler.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.291
So he finds himself

25:43.375 --> 25:44.626
falling into a hole--
what does he do?

25:44.709 --> 25:46.586
Maybe he starts
skimming.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.464
You know, to cover the debt.
After all, with all that cash,

25:49.548 --> 25:52.300
nobody's gonna be too upset
about a little cash missing

25:52.384 --> 25:54.594
here or there, but once
that hole starts getting

25:54.678 --> 25:56.972
bigger and bigger,
well, he needs

25:57.055 --> 26:00.850
to play more and more often and
for larger and larger amounts,

26:00.934 --> 26:04.354
until finally,
old bad luck Chuck found himself

26:04.437 --> 26:06.314
in a hole
there was no crawling out of.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.483
The counterfeiter
he was working for

26:08.566 --> 26:11.319
must have realized
what he was doing.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.530
I bet they were not
too happy about that.

26:13.613 --> 26:16.199
Oh, you got that right,
and I bet that was the moment

26:16.283 --> 26:18.785
they decided that his services
were no longer needed,

26:18.868 --> 26:21.788
and that's when old Chuck's luck
ran out permanently.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.086
Lou, I got something.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.838
All right, come on,
tell me something good.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.464
I spoke to Secret Service.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.342
They could tell from the ink
on Chuck's counterfeit cash

26:34.426 --> 26:36.344
that it was generated
in North Korea.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.221
And it's not
just showing up in Oahu.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.848
Bills like these
are popping up globally.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.641
You're talking about
a worldwide criminal operation.

26:41.725 --> 26:45.645
Exactly. And how did
all this funny money get here?

26:45.729 --> 26:48.398
Well, let me tell you another
fun factoid that I learned:

26:48.481 --> 26:49.399
Apparently,

26:49.482 --> 26:51.901
North Korea's trade embargoes
are so severe

26:51.985 --> 26:53.361
that most of their exports,

26:53.445 --> 26:56.197
especially illegal ones,
are being routed through China.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.240
GROVER:
Okay, so we need

26:57.324 --> 26:59.367
to find a connection
with the People's Republic.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.244
Nice work, kiddo.
That's a hell of a lead.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.121
Well, I aim to please.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.456
All right, we'll be in touch.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.962
Here you go. All right.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.005
CADDY:
Hold the door, please.

27:12.088 --> 27:14.382
GROVER:
Hang... hang on, kiddo.
Here you go.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.717
Let me help you out. Come on.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.760
I got you.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.760
Oh, thanks.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.011
Thank you.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.387
(typing)

27:19.471 --> 27:21.181
So, uh, the Secret Service says

27:21.264 --> 27:23.850
that that counterfeit money
was printed in North Korea.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.394
And, you know, by the way,
some of the members

27:26.478 --> 27:29.105
you have in this place
are some absolute...

27:29.189 --> 27:30.940
Oh. This is new.
What is it?

27:31.024 --> 27:34.361
I have some experience
in forensic accounting,

27:34.444 --> 27:36.029
and I created this visual

27:36.112 --> 27:37.572
to help us better understand

27:37.655 --> 27:39.366
Chuck's business
ventures and how

27:39.449 --> 27:41.659
the counterfeit money
came into play.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.661
Maybe we can start with this.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.661
Hmm.

27:43.745 --> 27:47.207
The bills were shipped out
of ports in China.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.376
Do any of Chuck's businesses
track to that?

27:49.459 --> 27:51.211
No, but let me...

27:51.294 --> 27:55.423
I've been looking through
well-known businesses

27:55.507 --> 27:58.259
of our club members,
trying to find any signs of

27:58.343 --> 28:01.221
financial indiscretion,
and with this new

28:01.304 --> 28:03.098
information about China,

28:03.181 --> 28:05.058
this could narrow down
my search quite a bit.

28:05.141 --> 28:07.102
Just bear with me.

28:05.141 --> 28:07.102
All right, though,
take your time.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.729
I'm gonna go get me a
sangwich from over...

28:07.185 --> 28:09.729
Got something.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.106
Or not.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.273
ZEV:
Michael Mayfield.

28:12.357 --> 28:16.111
Member in the club since 2017.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.113
His import-export company

28:18.196 --> 28:21.116
operates out of Shanghai.

28:18.196 --> 28:21.116
Well, that's good.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.909
But you know, Zev,

28:22.992 --> 28:25.787
lot of people do business
out of China these days.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.622
Does he have any other
connection to our vic?

28:27.705 --> 28:31.584
Yes. Apparently,
around nine months ago,

28:31.668 --> 28:33.753
Mr. Mayfield and Chuck

28:33.837 --> 28:36.965
suddenly started signing up
for joint tee times.

28:37.048 --> 28:40.468
These guys are playing three,
four times a month since then.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.138
So, Chuck's businesses,
what were they doing,

28:43.221 --> 28:44.472
what was it, nine months ago?

28:44.556 --> 28:45.974
What were they
doing then?

28:44.556 --> 28:45.974
Here.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.143
Just about
the same time,

28:48.226 --> 28:50.145
Chuck saw a
distinct uptick

28:50.228 --> 28:53.314
in income
all over his businesses.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.443
So, Chuck found himself a lot
more than a golfing partner.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.654
Yeah.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.654
Hey, that list
from this morning,

28:59.737 --> 29:01.614
is Mayfield on it?

29:04.617 --> 29:08.538
He came in just after 8:00
for an 8:45 tee time.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.915
He should still be
on the course, but not for long.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.460
This is Zev.

29:13.543 --> 29:17.130
I need to get ahold of a member
who's currently on the course.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.007
A Michael Mayfield.

29:19.090 --> 29:23.136
Tell him there's an urgent call
back at the clubhouse.

29:23.219 --> 29:26.514
Ah, yeah. Have him come to us
so we don't make a scene.

ZEV: Captain, there's
one thing I don't understand.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.239
Why would Mayfield stay
on the premises

31:06.322 --> 31:07.448
after killing Chuck?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.242
The guy's a member
here at the club.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.285
He knows the club's
fully aware

31:10.368 --> 31:12.620

and goings around here.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.289
Of course.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.624
It would have looked
very, very suspicious

31:16.708 --> 31:19.168

31:19.252 --> 31:20.295
Mm.

Mr. Mayfield.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.303

today, Captain Grover.

31:28.386 --> 31:29.637
That's Mayfield?

31:29.721 --> 31:32.640
Yeah.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.640

on the first tee.

Mr. Mayfield.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.791
I don't know why you're running.
We just wanted to

33:21.874 --> 33:23.418
chase you down
and return your three iron.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.420
(chuckles) Yeah.
Hang on a second

33:25.503 --> 33:28.381
while I, uh, get these
handcuffs on you.

33:28.464 --> 33:29.507
(grunting)

33:34.846 --> 33:36.639
This is actually
a really nice three iron.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.934
Wait a second,
what is this?

33:41.352 --> 33:42.895
How'd this happen?

33:42.979 --> 33:44.814
Don't worry,
I'll tell you.

33:44.897 --> 33:48.443
You see, because I'll wager a
large sum of money that, uh,

33:48.526 --> 33:50.570
the indentations
on your thee iron

33:50.653 --> 33:52.447
are the same
distance apart

33:52.530 --> 33:53.781
as the handles
on the cryo-freezer

33:53.865 --> 33:56.117
back at the club.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.785
The one you barred

33:57.869 --> 33:59.620
in order to flash-freeze Chuck.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.748
I'm no detective,
Mr. Mayfield,

34:01.831 --> 34:03.833
but this doesn't
look good for you.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.460
Stand up.

34:05.543 --> 34:06.753
(grunting)

34:08.755 --> 34:11.090
GROVER:
I don't think we can say
this investigation's

34:11.174 --> 34:13.092
flying under the radar anymore.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.594
I would say not.

LUKE:
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey,
no running in the house.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.478
Guys.

34:23.561 --> 34:26.981
Dogs... dogs really are
the great equalizer.

34:23.561 --> 34:26.981
Thank you.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.525
You don't know the half of it.
Cheers.

34:29.609 --> 34:30.485
Cheers.

34:29.609 --> 34:30.485
<i>Salud.</i>

34:30.568 --> 34:33.362
Yeah, Blake's wanted
a puppy forever, so, uh,

34:33.446 --> 34:35.490
I'm never getting him
out of here. Thanks for that.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.325
Ah, kind of like Danny.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.160
I'm staying here temporarily.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.496
Yeah. You, uh, you've been
moving your stuff

34:41.579 --> 34:42.663
into Junior's room, though.

34:42.747 --> 34:45.458
I-- Yeah. That's because I don't
want to sleep every night

34:45.541 --> 34:48.419
with Eddie's fur
engulfed in my face

34:48.503 --> 34:49.837
every night.
That's why.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.798
Don't worry about
the angry outbursts.

34:51.881 --> 34:53.633
They're kind of
his love language for me.

34:51.881 --> 34:53.633
No. Hey, look, man.

34:53.716 --> 34:55.301
It's no worries.
I'm going through a divorce.

34:55.384 --> 34:56.469
I feel right at home.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.471
DANNY:
That is tough
stuff, man.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.515
It's a stupid question,
but how you doing?

35:00.598 --> 35:01.808
I'm not doing good, but, I mean,

35:01.891 --> 35:05.144
it's got to get better
eventually, right?

35:01.891 --> 35:05.144
Maybe. Yeah, I mean,

35:05.228 --> 35:07.355
you know, definitely gonna
get worse than it is right now.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.148
Oh, great.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.148
Well, look,

35:09.232 --> 35:13.528
you're alone now, right?
You-you slowly start to realize,

35:13.611 --> 35:16.531
like, you know, the one thing
that meant the most to me--

35:16.614 --> 35:20.201
my family-- that thing's
broken up now, and...

35:20.284 --> 35:22.370
you're partially
responsible for that.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.496
So you're gonna
get depressed.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.540
You're not gonna
be able to sleep.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.874
The point is,
you're gonna be a wreck,

35:26.958 --> 35:28.417
but that's, you know,
that's a good thing.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.710
Why is that a good thing?

35:29.794 --> 35:31.587
It's a good thing
because, uh,

35:31.671 --> 35:34.715
divorce is a, is a, is a trauma,
it's a real trauma,

35:34.799 --> 35:37.385
and, you know, you got to heal
from that trauma,

35:37.468 --> 35:38.469
and as long as you're not numb,

35:38.553 --> 35:41.848
as long as you're going through
the stages of grief

35:41.931 --> 35:43.099
that you need to go through,

35:43.182 --> 35:44.976
you'll come out of that
and you-you will heal.

35:45.059 --> 35:47.061
That way,
you get to be a good dad.

35:47.144 --> 35:49.355
Yeah, that's the most
important thing.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.567
Absolutely. And this is the only
advice I'm gonna give you:

35:52.650 --> 35:55.528
Don't ever, ever
disrespect your ex

35:55.611 --> 35:57.071
in front of your kid.

35:57.154 --> 35:58.364
Don't do it,
because they...

35:58.447 --> 36:00.575
they watch
and they see everything

36:00.658 --> 36:02.702
and-and-and
they follow our lead.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.745
You know what I mean?

36:04.829 --> 36:07.123
And, you know, look,
I guess you don't have to,

36:07.206 --> 36:09.041
uh, go through this alone.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.170
You ever want to get together,
have a beer, you know,

36:12.253 --> 36:13.588
give us a call.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.258
Well, fellas, thank you.
I really appreciate this.

36:17.341 --> 36:18.342
I mean, this really helps.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.261
And-and thank you for-for giving
Blake an opportunity

36:20.344 --> 36:21.554
to apologize to Charlie.
Thank you.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.599
Oh, it's good, man. Kids fight,
they make up. It's good.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.599
Yeah.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.559
Eight-year-olds, they make it
look so easy, don't they?

36:26.642 --> 36:27.935
Yeah, they do.

36:26.642 --> 36:27.935
(doorbell rings)

36:32.857 --> 36:34.817
There you are.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.817
Oh, my God.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.611
Oh, my God, people. Finally.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.238
I heard you, uh, you had some
real "you" time today, huh?

36:39.322 --> 36:41.490
Yeah, yeah, if that's what
people call "self-care,"

36:41.574 --> 36:43.618
then I, uh, I don't want
anything to do with it,

36:43.701 --> 36:44.785
'cause I need
human interaction.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.120
BLAKE: Tag. You're it.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.120
I'm a human.

36:46.203 --> 36:48.080
TANI: Look at this
miniature human.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.790
Who's that with Charlie?

36:48.164 --> 36:49.790
That's, um...

36:49.874 --> 36:51.459
Who are you?

36:49.874 --> 36:51.459
This is Luke.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.085

36:51.542 --> 36:53.085
Luke, this is Tani.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.795
Hi. Nice to meet you.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.795
He's a colleague of ours.

36:54.879 --> 36:55.796
It's a pleasure.

36:54.879 --> 36:55.796
Hello.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.797
That's, uh, Danno.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.797
TANI: Yeah.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.090
Uh, let me
get you a drink.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.675
Yes.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.675
Okay.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.303
Did you, uh, did you hear
from Junior today?

37:02.386 --> 37:04.847
Yeah, yeah.
He left a voice mail.

37:04.931 --> 37:09.268
That's a tough message to get.
It's tough to leave, too.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.311
Hey, listen,
you know, uh,

37:10.394 --> 37:12.813
he's gonna be okay.
He's in great company, okay?

37:12.897 --> 37:14.941
But, uh, if you want
to talk about it, just...

37:15.024 --> 37:16.776
I'm available.
You should call me.

37:16.859 --> 37:18.903
Yeah, thanks. Appreciate that.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.488
All right.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.488
Means a lot, actually.

37:20.571 --> 37:23.366
Uh, where's Grover and Quinn?

37:23.449 --> 37:25.701
Oh, Quinn, I don't know,
she may or may not be coming,

37:25.785 --> 37:29.956
and Grover had to do
some post-case wrap-up,

37:30.039 --> 37:32.333
something or other.
I don't even know. Do you know?

37:32.416 --> 37:35.002
No. Okay.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.002
I don't even know.
What do you want to drink?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.088
♪ ♪

37:56.941 --> 37:58.567
Hey.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.820
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this straight.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.655
Mm-hmm?

38:00.903 --> 38:02.655
You've been trying

38:02.738 --> 38:05.032
for eight years to
get into the club?

38:02.738 --> 38:05.032
Yep.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.743
And now, when they finally
offer you a membership,

38:07.827 --> 38:09.537
you say no?

38:07.827 --> 38:09.537
Yeah, well, you know,

38:09.620 --> 38:12.748
us Americans, Zev,
we're kind of funny.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.750
Uh-huh. That's one
way to put it.

38:14.834 --> 38:17.211
I actually like
the club a lot, Zev.

38:17.294 --> 38:19.505
The people, though,
not so much.

38:19.588 --> 38:22.049
Did you know that, um,
while I've been at the bottom

38:22.133 --> 38:24.593
of this wait list
for all these years,

38:24.677 --> 38:26.721
the club has been fast-tracking

38:26.804 --> 38:30.182
more high-income clients
for membership.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.309
Wish I could say
that surprises me.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.186
Yeah. That was a little
something I learned

38:34.270 --> 38:37.106
when going over
the club's books.

38:37.189 --> 38:39.567
Today was extremely clarifying.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.193
You're a very honorable man.

38:42.528 --> 38:45.573
So are you, baby.
Now, you see this?

38:45.656 --> 38:47.616
This is what
it's about,

38:47.700 --> 38:50.703
not that pretentious,
hoity-toity nonsense.

38:50.786 --> 38:52.913
Okay, just two
guys out here

38:52.997 --> 38:54.790
playing a round of golf,

38:54.874 --> 38:56.876
having a good time,
enjoying the weather.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.627
I agree.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.627
Good. Now let's play.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.589
Okay.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.589
How about we, um,

39:01.672 --> 39:03.674
make it interesting?

39:01.672 --> 39:03.674
What?

39:03.758 --> 39:06.469
Winner buys drinks.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.469
You're on.

39:06.552 --> 39:07.428
All right, then.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.430
Let's see you now.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.430
All right, here we go.

39:09.513 --> 39:10.681
All right, give me room now.
Step back.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.892
Watch the master
at work.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.990
Mr. Noshimuri.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.909
The only reason you are here

39:29.992 --> 39:33.162
and not in the bottom
of the Sumida River

39:33.245 --> 39:36.457
is because of the respect
I have for your father.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.627
I am very grateful
for this meeting, Ryo-sama.

39:39.710 --> 39:43.005
I suggest you make the most
of this opportunity.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.715
You will not get
another like it.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.514
There are things you must know

39:51.597 --> 39:54.642
about Kenji Higashi.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.435
He killed Masuda-san.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.647
He brings dishonor

39:59.730 --> 40:03.275
to his clan,
to the entire organization.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.902
He is not to be trusted.

40:09.615 --> 40:12.618
You are taking
quite a risk,

40:12.701 --> 40:16.080
coming here with these
kinds of accusations.

40:17.331 --> 40:18.666
And all because

40:18.749 --> 40:21.585
you want to do
the right thing, yes?

40:22.586 --> 40:24.630
With respect.

40:24.713 --> 40:27.675
Kenji is not fit to be oyabun.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.511
You feel you are
better suited to lead?

40:30.594 --> 40:33.764
I already have the support
of a number of the brothers...

40:35.599 --> 40:38.811
...but I will only proceed
with your blessing.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.695
You are sure
this is what you want?

40:47.778 --> 40:51.198
The reason I am here

40:51.282 --> 40:53.701
in this room,

40:53.784 --> 40:55.703
on this earth,

40:55.786 --> 40:59.582
is because of Hiro Noshimuri.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.209
His blood is in my veins.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.381
I have tried to run
from my destiny...

41:07.464 --> 41:10.134
Child of a frog is a frog.

41:10.217 --> 41:14.555
Oyabun is my birthright,

41:14.638 --> 41:16.265
<i>kumicho.</i>

41:32.156 --> 41:34.450
I will allow this,

41:34.533 --> 41:36.577
but on one condition.

41:36.660 --> 41:40.039
You must first
prove your loyalty.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.792
Of course.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.253
Whatever you ask of me,
I will do it.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.590
You will return
to your task force on Hawaii,

41:49.673 --> 41:54.428
to be my eyes and ears
inside Five-O.

41:56.055 --> 42:00.726
If I return to Five-O,
I-I become a target to Kenji.

42:00.809 --> 42:02.853
So does Tamiko. I-I...

42:04.688 --> 42:06.273
I cannot have that.

42:06.357 --> 42:10.236
As long as you do
what I ask of you,

42:10.319 --> 42:12.279
you have my word

42:12.363 --> 42:15.407
Kenji will pose no threat.

42:17.534 --> 42:18.911
So, Mr. Noshimuri,

42:18.994 --> 42:21.747
the question remains--

42:21.830 --> 42:26.293
how badly do you want
to fulfill your destiny?

42:26.377 --> 42:28.170
To whom are you loyal?
