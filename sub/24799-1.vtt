…That I could bring them back.

but I couldn't…

06:01.527 --> 06:03.738

06:04.238 --> 06:06.657

06:08.159 --> 06:11.079
I found this… this cool park…

06:12.330 --> 06:16.667
so big that I can get lost in it
when I want to.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.880
Then one day,

06:21.464 --> 06:24.985
I saw these weirdos walking

06:34.769 --> 06:36.955
I wanted to know
what was going on in there,

06:36.979 --> 06:38.564
and if there was any food…

06:41.025 --> 06:42.401

But, um, maybe this is some of that
“act of God” type shit,

06:59.085 --> 07:02.213
that I found this place
and all of you people…

07:04.215 --> 07:05.984

Hi, Ellie.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.326
Sorry, I've, um…

07:34.745 --> 07:39.000
It's hard doing this all over again
in a new place.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.793
WOMAN: It's okay.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.089
It's just that I just moved here.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.137
So here goes. Um…

07:55.224 --> 07:56.851
It started with one drink.

07:58.227 --> 08:03.149
And then that one went into another,
and then a whole hell of a lot more.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.884
I was an addict, but I thought,

08:11.908 --> 08:15.620
“It's no big deal. Everyone is, kind of.”

08:18.956 --> 08:19.916
But, um…

08:22.418 --> 08:23.669
I thought, “This is…

08:25.630 --> 08:27.507
I can handle this. This is easy.”

08:29.467 --> 08:30.468
(SIGHS)

08:31.761 --> 08:34.780
But then I… I hurt my back.

08:34.804 --> 08:38.226
And they gave me these pills,

08:39.018 --> 08:40.937
these goddamn pills.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.399
And they took the edge off
like nothing else.

08:47.818 --> 08:52.031
Sorry, I know I'm not supposed to say
what drug, sorry.

08:53.908 --> 08:59.205
But they took the life out of life,
which was exactly what I wanted.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.168
And…

09:05.628 --> 09:07.004
my husband left me…

09:09.340 --> 09:12.486
which, to be honest,
wasn't such a bad thing.

(ALL LAUGHING)

09:14.554 --> 09:16.055

But I lost my kids.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.649
And, uh…

09:27.858 --> 09:30.045
at first, I didn't really care,

09:30.069 --> 09:33.197
because I wanted the pills
more than I wanted them.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.703
I can't believe I'm saying that right now.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.705
(SIGHS)

09:43.666 --> 09:45.644
Anyway, I got my kids back.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.546
And we have a new home…

have done it without you.

You don't have to call it that.

19:59.823 --> 20:00.741

Why do you always go for a run so late?

It's not that late.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.175
It's not bad.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.092

You might be the only person
to talk to about this.

I don't know,
I just needed somebody to talk to whose…

all of your effort into controlling.

it was something else other than drugs?

I would take the El

44:59.863 --> 45:01.800
She was the art history teacher
at the college,

45:01.824 --> 45:06.554
so whenever she got done with class,
she'd come find me, and she'd get me out.

45:06.578 --> 45:12.501

try to figure it out.

if she wanted to talk about it.

till she told me what it was.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.270
it was too late.
