HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

10:02.002 --> 10:04.004

THE COFFEE, SO...

10:05.138 --> 10:07.941

ROBERT KING SPRITZEL.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.724
HE WON
THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD

10:56.757 --> 10:57.991
WHEN HE WAS 28.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.961
AND THE PULITZER
WHEN HE WAS 33.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.296
PRESIDENT CARTER CALLED HIM
A NATIONAL TREASURE.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.734
THEY PLAYED RACQUETBALL
IN A REGULAR GAME.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.803
HE WAS A GREAT WRITER.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.972
BUT WHAT WAS THE COST?

11:12.005 --> 11:15.042
DID HE NEGLECT HIS FAMILY?

11:15.075 --> 11:16.910
NO, HE DIDN'T.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.846
HE WAS A FINE FATHER.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.914
MORE THAN THAT, REALLY.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.283
IT'S FRUITLESS
FOR SHELLY TO BE DANCING.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.918
SHE SHOULD
FIND ANOTHER INTEREST

11:24.952 --> 11:28.055
THAT WOULD BE
MORE REWARDING TO HER,

11:28.088 --> 11:30.924
THAT SHE CAN TAKE MORE FROM,
DAVID.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.125
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.994

DO SOMETHING, SON.

SO...

11:36.897 --> 11:39.800
HOW'S MICHAEL?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.068
I THINK
THAT WAS AN OVERREACTION

11:41.101 --> 11:42.235
ON NOREEN'S PART.

11:42.269 --> 11:45.338
I DON'T THINK HE HAS
A PROBLEM WITH POT.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.207
LET'S HOPE.

I HAD ENCOURAGED SHELLY

12:03.390 --> 12:07.127

ACTIVITIES AND INTERESTS.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.896
SHE PICKED ARCHERY.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.464
SO, I TOOK HER
TO AN ARCHERY RANGE

12:11.498 --> 12:12.866

AND...

12:43.530 --> 12:44.998
OW!

12:45.032 --> 12:48.068
ALL RIGHT.
JUST REMEMBER,

12:48.101 --> 12:51.805
PULL IT STRAIGHT BACK,
PARALLEL TO YOUR EAR.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.441
YOU CAN DO IT,
SHELLY.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.105
THEY WENT TO THE MALL.
HE JUST CALLED ME.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.840
HE FINISHED HIS REHAB.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.257
THAT'S GOOD.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.192
WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?

16:32.225 --> 16:35.462

16:35.495 --> 16:39.399
WELL,

16:39.432 --> 16:42.369

17:29.649 --> 17:32.152
SO, DO YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.353

WHAT HAPPENED?

17:52.339 --> 17:54.541

17:54.574 --> 17:55.808
WHY?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.410
WHAT?

17:57.444 --> 17:59.812
WHY DID YOU GET HIT
WITH A FROSTY?

17:59.846 --> 18:00.380
WHAT IS A FROSTY?

18:00.413 --> 18:03.650
A FROSTY'S A...
SHAKE.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.517
FROM WENDY'S.

18:04.551 --> 18:08.155
WHY WOULD SOMEONE THROW
A SHAKE AT YOU?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.358
THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.326
PEOPLE THROW SHAKES
AT YOU?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.695
STUFF. PEOPLE THROW
STUFF AT ME SOMETIMES.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.864
IF THEY DON'T LIKE ME
OR SOMETHING.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.732
THEY DON'T KNOW YOU.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.701
FROM TV.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.237
BUT YOU JUST
READ THE WEATHER.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.538
WELL,
I PREDICT IT.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.575
YOU DON'T HAVE A DEGREE
IN METEOROLOGY.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.878
I MAKE SUPPOSITIONS
OR...

18:31.911 --> 18:33.346
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:33.380 --> 18:35.215
I WALKED OVER.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.317
WALKED? IT'S FREEZING.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.586
I HAVE LYMPHOMA, DAVID.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.421
WHAT?

18:41.454 --> 18:44.791
I HAVE...LYMPHOMA.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.327
DR. PRITCH CALLED.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.229
WHAT?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.497
I WAS HAVING TREMORS.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.899
THAT'S THE REASON
I WENT IN.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.302
PRITCH READ MY SCANS.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.504
WHAT'S THE PROGNOSIS?

18:57.537 --> 18:59.706
WELL, IT'S...
IT'S NOT GOOD.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.409
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
THIS WEEKEND.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.776
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.512
YEAH.

19:05.545 --> 19:12.452
I'LL CALL YOU AFTER
I'VE TALKED TO PRITCH AGAIN.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.255
I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.957
I LIKE THE FRESH AIR.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.859
I'LL WALK BACK WITH YOU.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.794
THAT'S OK.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.932
OK...

19:45.685 --> 19:47.354
Dave:
EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS

19:47.387 --> 19:49.656
SOMEONE THROWS
SOMETHING AT ME.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.293
A SHAKE, A BURRITO ONCE.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.463
WHY? MY NAME PARTLY,
I GUESS.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.466
I CHANGED IT
FOR PROFESSIONAL REASONS.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.768
MY FIRST STATION MANAGER
SUGGESTED IT.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.570
HE SAID
IT SOUNDED REFRESHING,

20:03.603 --> 20:05.372
AND THAT THEY WANTED
THAT QUALITY.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.541
THAT MAY BE TRUE,
BUT IT'S ALSO ANNOYING.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.709
I KNOW THAT.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.312
WHAT KIND OF NAME
IS SPRITZ?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.947
IT'S A BULLSHIT NAME.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.983
IT'S A TV NAME.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.252
HE'S BULLSHIT.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.888
I LIKE HIM.
HE'S HANDSOME.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.490
HE'S AN ASSHOLE.

20:23.523 --> 20:28.828
I DON'T LIKE HIS FACE,
HIS ASSHOLE FACE.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.434
Dave: THE OTHER THING,
MY JOB'S VERY EASY.

20:34.467 --> 20:38.905
TWO HOURS A DAY,
BASICALLY READING PROMPTS.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.877
I MAKE $240,000 A YEAR,
PLUS APPEARANCES.

20:44.911 --> 20:50.317
WHICH ARE, YOU KNOW,
NOT COMFORTABLE FOR ME,

20:50.350 --> 20:53.353
BUT LUCRATIVE.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.522
"FOUR SCORE
AND SEVEN YEARS AGO,

20:55.555 --> 21:00.259
"OUR FATHERS BROUGHT FORTH
ON THIS CONTINENT..."

21:07.033 --> 21:09.369
Dave: ALSO,
IT MAKES OTHER THINGS EASY,

21:09.402 --> 21:10.703
BEING ON TV.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.774
EVERYTHING'S EASY.

21:14.807 --> 21:15.942
OHH!

21:15.975 --> 21:17.910
YEAH!

21:17.944 --> 21:19.946
OHH!

21:23.416 --> 21:24.717
YEAH!

21:24.751 --> 21:26.052
Dave: I RECEIVE
A LARGE REWARD

21:26.085 --> 21:28.988
FOR PRETTY MUCH ZERO EFFORT
AND CONTRIBUTION.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.790
THE SHAKES AND STUFF

21:30.823 --> 21:32.825
ARE A REACTION TO THAT,
I THINK.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.443
Dave: WHAT MUST
YOU THINK OF ME,

21:50.477 --> 21:52.445
YOUR FAMILY LEADER,

21:52.479 --> 21:54.681
YOUR NON-METEOROLOGIST
YET WEATHER MAN

21:54.714 --> 21:58.751

22:01.554 --> 22:03.089
GIVE ME TIME

22:03.122 --> 22:04.824
GIVE ME LITTLE WHILE.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.460
LET ME GET
THE HELLO AMERICA JOB.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.995
I CAN GET IT TOGETHER.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.463

22:43.496 --> 22:44.564
I GOT MINE, DON.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.998
NAW, IT'S COOL.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.034
THANKS.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.090
TRICIA'S A BITCH.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.160
SHE'S A LITTLE CUNT.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.963
I HATE
THAT LITTLE CUNT.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.733
I'D LIKE TO BURN HER.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.944
HI.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.946
HI.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.015

24:06.713 --> 24:08.581
HEY, TIM.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.749
I DIDN'T KNOW

24:09.782 --> 24:11.217
I ALWAYS COME TO THESE...

24:11.250 --> 24:13.753

24:15.254 --> 24:16.656
I HAVE SOME TIME

25:42.709 --> 25:46.278
RELAX.
WE'RE WAY LAST.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.280
THERE'S A LESSON HERE.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.248
LET'S FINISH.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.783
I HURT!

25:50.817 --> 25:53.720
HON, YOU CAN DO IT.
YOU CAN FINISH, OK?

25:53.753 --> 25:54.787
I DON'T WANT YOU

25:54.821 --> 25:57.724
IT'S GOING TO MEAN
A LOT TO DAD, OK?

25:57.757 --> 26:01.594
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.296
THAT'S MY GIRL.
THAT'S IT.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.332
GOOD.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.167
OK?

26:12.872 --> 26:15.041

26:21.180 --> 26:23.015
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

26:23.049 --> 26:26.653
THAT WAS LIKE A HUNDRED YARDS
YOU MADE ME GO!

26:26.686 --> 26:30.089
I'M NOT
A FOOTBALL JOCKER.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.061
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:35.094 --> 26:37.964
JUST--WE GOT TANGLED UP
IN THE SACK.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.031
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:39.065 --> 26:40.232
SHE TORE HER ACL.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.034
THESE FUCKING CRUTCHES
ARE TOO LONG.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.202
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

26:43.235 --> 26:45.071
SHELLY!

26:46.005 --> 26:47.707
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

26:47.740 --> 26:48.875
IT WAS A PICNIC.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.677
AND SHE TORE SOMETHING?

26:50.710 --> 26:52.211
ACL, MCL.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.080

26:54.113 --> 26:55.381
BOTH.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.683
DAVE!

26:56.716 --> 26:57.784
WE DIDN'T GO
BUNGEE-JUMPING!

26:57.817 --> 27:00.019
IT WAS A FUCKING
POTATO SACK RACE.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.187
THAT'S WHERE SHE GOT IT.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.121
WHAT?

27:02.154 --> 27:04.056
FUCKING THIS,

27:04.090 --> 27:05.892
I NEVER SAID THAT
AROUND HER.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.193
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE,
DAVE,

27:07.226 --> 27:09.662
BECAUSE YOU
DON'T PAY ATTENTION!

27:10.429 --> 27:11.931

27:18.771 --> 27:19.739
STEP BACK?

27:19.772 --> 27:21.273
STEP BACK.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.242
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, RUSS?

27:23.275 --> 27:23.743
RUSS--

27:23.776 --> 27:25.745
STEP BACK RIGHT NOW.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.780
FUCK YOU RIGHT NOW.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.849
FUCK YOU, SPRITZ.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.184
FUCK YOU, FAT ASSHOLE!

27:32.218 --> 27:33.452
DILDO!

27:33.485 --> 27:36.188
DAVID,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:36.222 --> 27:38.925
I'M TALKING TO MY WIFE,
I'M TALKING TO NOREEN,

27:38.958 --> 27:40.426
AND THIS CLOWN,
WHOSE BUSINESS THIS ISN'T--

27:40.459 --> 27:41.761
YOU CALL ME A DILDO,

27:41.794 --> 27:43.329
IT IS MY BUSINESS,
SPRITZ.

27:43.362 --> 27:47.033
YOU ARE A DILDO,
PORK FUCK. PORKER!

27:47.066 --> 27:49.769
STOP, SON, WOULD YOU?

27:49.802 --> 27:50.737
WHY DON'T YOU GO?

27:50.770 --> 27:53.873
WHY--WHY ARE YOU HERE?

27:53.906 --> 27:54.874
ARE YOU OK?

27:54.907 --> 27:57.309
I CAME
TO TALK TO NOREEN.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.446
DAVE, COME ON,
I WILL TALK TO YOU LATER.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.054
DAVE,
WHAT'S GOING ON, SON?

28:08.087 --> 28:09.455
NOTHING. JUST--

28:09.488 --> 28:11.057
WHY ARE YOU HERE
ANYWAY?

28:11.090 --> 28:13.092
I CAME TO TALK TO NOREEN
ABOUT AN ISSUE

28:13.125 --> 28:15.027
CONCERNING SHELLY.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.797
WELL, YOU CAN TALK TO ME.
I'M HER PARENT, TOO.

28:17.830 --> 28:18.831
SO, WHAT?

28:18.865 --> 28:23.469
SHELLY DRESSES IN CLOTHING
NOT APPROPRIATE FOR HER.

28:23.502 --> 28:25.071
CLINGING STUFF.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.973
ALL KIDS WEAR--

28:27.006 --> 28:28.841
DAD,
IT'S A DIFFERENT GENERATION.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.744
THEY CALL HER "CAMEL-TOE."

28:32.478 --> 28:33.846
WHAT?

28:33.880 --> 28:35.514
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?

28:35.547 --> 28:36.415
WHAT?

28:36.448 --> 28:39.251
THAT HER COLLEAGUES
CALL HER "CAMEL-TOE"?

28:39.285 --> 28:41.120
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

28:41.153 --> 28:42.454
IT MEANS
THE CREASE IN HER VAGINA

28:42.488 --> 28:45.357
THAT THEY CAN DISCERN
THROUGH HER CLOTHING.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.392
WHAT?

28:46.425 --> 28:47.393
CAMEL-TOE.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.360
YEAH, I HEARD YOU.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.829
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY DO THAT?

28:49.862 --> 28:51.330
I HEARD IT.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.165
I PICKED SHELLY UP
ON WEDNESDAY,

28:53.199 --> 28:56.235
HEARD TAUNTING,
THE OLDER BOYS CALLING IT.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.503
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD WRONG.

28:57.536 --> 28:58.104
NO, I HEARD--

28:58.137 --> 29:00.106
OK, OK, LOOK,
I'LL DEAL.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.373
I WANT TO GET HER THROUGH
THIS ACL THING,

29:01.407 --> 29:02.842
I'M GOING
TO TAKE HER SHOOTING,

29:02.875 --> 29:03.943
I'M GOING TO RE-APPLY HER
THERE,

29:03.976 --> 29:05.111
I'M GOING TO GET HER
TALKING TO ME,

29:05.144 --> 29:06.145
I'M GOING TO GET TO HER.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.147
I'M GOING
TO WORK IT OUT.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.565
Dave: A CAMEL-TOE
IS PRETTY MUCH

29:26.598 --> 29:28.767
WHAT ROBERT SAID
IT WAS.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.906
IT'S BASICALLY JUST
WHEN YOU CAN MAKE OUT MORE

29:33.940 --> 29:35.074
THAN YOU SHOULD.

29:35.107 --> 29:38.077
(HORNS HONKING)

29:39.078 --> 29:40.913
BUT IT'S
THE KIND OF THING--

29:40.947 --> 29:43.149
SHE'S 12, YOU KNOW?

29:43.182 --> 29:44.917
IF YOU'RE AROUND
AND PAYING ATTENTION,

29:44.951 --> 29:46.018
YOU CATCH IT.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.887
THEN NAME-CALLING
DOESN'T START,

29:47.920 --> 29:50.189
THEN MAYBE
SMOKING DOESN'T START,

29:50.222 --> 29:52.224
THEN MAYBE SHE CAN
JUST STAY A HAPPY KID

29:52.258 --> 29:54.894
FOR A COUPLE MORE YEARS.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.996
SHE SHOULDN'T BE UNHAPPY.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.097
FUCK.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.399
WHAT DID SHE EVER DO
TO ANYBODY?

30:00.432 --> 30:02.468
SHELLY...

30:08.507 --> 30:10.910
(RINGING)

30:10.943 --> 30:12.945
HELLO?

30:12.979 --> 30:14.446
HEY.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.915
HEY.

30:15.948 --> 30:19.018
LISTEN, NOREEN,
I WAS THINKING,

30:19.051 --> 30:21.854
THIS PUSHING AND PULLING--

30:21.888 --> 30:24.123
THE TUG-OF-WAR
WE DO SOMETIMES,

30:24.156 --> 30:25.992
IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR THE KIDS.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.327
(SIGHS) IT'S NOT.

30:28.360 --> 30:32.098
NOREEN, LET'S SEE SOMEBODY,
WORK IT OUT, LET'S--

30:32.131 --> 30:33.099
FUCK!

30:33.132 --> 30:34.400
ASSHOLE!

30:35.667 --> 30:36.936
ARE YOU OK?

30:36.969 --> 30:40.940
I--I GOT HIT WITH A POP.

30:40.973 --> 30:46.112
A FUCKING...BIG GULP.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.213
MAN...

30:47.246 --> 30:50.249
ARE YOU OK?
ARE YOU OK?

30:50.282 --> 30:51.884
YEAH, I'M OK. I'M OK.

30:51.918 --> 30:54.620
SO, UH,
I WAS SAYING--

30:54.653 --> 30:57.223
SEE SOMEBODY?

30:57.256 --> 30:58.024
WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN

30:58.057 --> 31:01.193
WITH SOME
TRUST-BUILDING EXERCISES,

31:01.227 --> 31:02.962
THE BUDDY DROP.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.297
UP ON YOUR FEET.
LET'S GO.

31:05.331 --> 31:08.367
UM, DAVE, NOREEN,
CENTER CIRCLE.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.440
OK.

31:14.473 --> 31:18.010
NOREEN, YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO LET YOURSELF GO,

31:18.044 --> 31:19.979
AND DAVE IS GOING
TO CATCH YOU.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.513
JUST GO BACK?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.615
YEAH,
CROSS YOUR ARMS UP FRONT.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.251
NOW?

31:25.284 --> 31:26.518
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.420
OK.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.159
VERY GOOD.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.594
ALL RIGHT,
TERESA, MARK, YOU'RE UP.

31:35.627 --> 31:38.597
OK, NOW,

31:38.630 --> 31:42.969
I WANT YOU TO NAME
SOMETHING YOU DID

31:43.002 --> 31:45.504
THAT AFFECTED YOUR PARTNER

31:45.537 --> 31:49.208
AND THAT
YOU'RE NOT PROUD OF.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.677
I HAD THIS THING
WITH PORNO

31:51.710 --> 31:53.445
ON THE COMPUTER,
SORT OF.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.014
I GOT
A LITTLE PREOCCUPIED--

31:55.047 --> 31:56.482
I ACTUALLY
WANT YOU TO WRITE IT DOWN,

31:56.515 --> 31:57.549
NOT SAY IT.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.550
OK.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.219
I WANT YOU TO PUT IT
ON THE PAPER

32:00.252 --> 32:01.520
THAT YOU GOT
FOR A REASON.

32:01.553 --> 32:02.621
OK.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.159
NOW, MAKE SURE
IT'S SOMETHING

32:07.193 --> 32:08.694
THE OTHER PERSON
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT,

32:08.727 --> 32:11.463
THAT THEY DON'T KNOW.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.976
ALL RIGHT, THEN YOU ARE
GOING TO GIVE IT

32:24.010 --> 32:26.078
TO THE OTHER PERSON.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.313
AND THE OTHER PERSON

32:27.346 --> 32:31.017
IS NEVER GOING
TO LOOK AT IT...

32:31.050 --> 32:33.252
EVER.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.421
THAT'S TRUST.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.283
WHAT'S UP?

33:15.061 --> 33:17.263
Noreen: I THOUGHT DAVE'S
SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL

33:17.296 --> 33:18.264
OR WHATEVER IT WAS

33:18.297 --> 33:20.099
WAS STUPID AND SUCKED.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.600
IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

33:21.633 --> 33:25.537
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
FOUR YEARS?

33:43.122 --> 33:46.125
I THOUGHT THAT WENT
PRETTY WELL.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.527
MM-HMM...YEAH!

33:59.538 --> 34:02.741
IT WASN'T SCIENCE FICTION,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.410
WHAT?

34:04.443 --> 34:07.646
IT WASN'T SCIENCE FICTION.
DID YOU EVEN READ IT?

34:07.679 --> 34:11.283
ONE OF THE SIDE CHARACTERS
WAS A SCIENTIST--

34:11.317 --> 34:13.518
GOD DAMN IT, DAVE!
GOD DAMN IT!

34:13.552 --> 34:15.286
WHAT? I'M JUST ASKING
DID YOU EVER EVEN READ IT?

34:15.321 --> 34:19.225
IT WAS HARD TO READ.
IT WAS POORLY WRITTEN.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.427
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE. GOD!

34:21.460 --> 34:24.663
YOU ARE
A CHAMPION ASSHOLE.

34:24.696 --> 34:28.467
YOU'RE A REAL
BLUE-RIBBON FUCK!

34:30.502 --> 34:32.571
I JUST WANT TO
MAKE IT WORK, NOREEN.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.172
I JUST WANT
TO KNOW EVERYTHING

34:34.206 --> 34:35.373
SO I CAN MAKE IT WORK.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.309
THAT'S WHY I--

34:37.342 --> 34:38.577
LOOK,
I WANT TO TRY AGAIN.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.879
I'M NOT GOING BACK.
YOU FUCKED IT UP!

34:40.911 --> 34:42.681
I MEAN OUR MARRIAGE.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.083
WHAT?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.790
I WANT TO TRY AGAIN.

34:52.891 --> 34:55.194
FUCK YOU.

34:55.226 --> 34:58.230
YOU KNOW, DAVE,
YOU CAN'T EVEN--

34:58.264 --> 35:00.599
YOU LOOKED AT IT.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.834
THAT'S DISHONEST.
IT'S CRAPPY.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.870
SHOULD I LOOK AT YOURS?

35:04.903 --> 35:05.904
THAT'S OK.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.473
NO, NO, NO--NOREEN.

35:07.506 --> 35:12.511
THROUGHOUT MARRIAGE,
BJs LACKED ENTHUSIASM.

35:12.544 --> 35:15.247
HAD DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
OVER HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.616
I THOUGHT VERY.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.819
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAVE?

35:22.721 --> 35:26.225
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
MY BJs LACKED ENTHUSIASM?

35:26.258 --> 35:28.760
I HATED YOU.

35:28.794 --> 35:33.699
I HATED YOUR HAIR,
I HATED YOUR UGLY LEGS,

35:33.732 --> 35:34.766
YOUR FOREARMS,

35:34.800 --> 35:38.537
I HATED KISSING
YOUR LIPS, DAVE, OK?

35:38.570 --> 35:40.439
AND THAT'S WHY
I LACKED ENTHUSIASM

35:40.472 --> 35:43.475
WHEN YOUR COCK
WAS IN MY MOUTH.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.912
HEY, HON!

35:47.813 --> 35:49.415
SHELLY, IT'S COLD.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.250
YOUR FATHER SAID
IT WAS GOING TO BE

35:51.283 --> 35:53.485
65 DEGREES TODAY,
BUT--

35:56.722 --> 35:59.425
Dave: GO AHEAD.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.692
HOW DID IT GO?

36:00.726 --> 36:03.662
GOOD.

36:03.695 --> 36:07.833
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.
GO AHEAD IN.

36:22.248 --> 36:25.217
DID YOU
START MY NOVEL YET?

36:25.251 --> 36:27.419
WHAT'S THAT?

36:27.453 --> 36:28.420
BREAKING POINT.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.556
DID YOU START
THAT?

36:30.589 --> 36:32.424
I HAVEN'T YET, SON.

36:32.458 --> 36:35.261
I'VE BEEN PREOCCUPIED.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.531
WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
ACTUALLY.

36:39.565 --> 36:43.269
I WANT TO MAKE
SOME CHANGES.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.604
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE NEW ONE.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.389
WHAT DID HE SAY?

37:03.422 --> 37:05.724
IT'S FURTHER. BAD NEWS.

37:05.757 --> 37:09.661
THE METASTATIC PLANE
WAS TOO WIDE FOR RADIATION.

37:09.695 --> 37:12.898
HE SUGGESTS I SEE
A DR. FROST IN NEW YORK

37:12.931 --> 37:15.501
FOR CLINICAL TRIALS.

37:26.378 --> 37:29.014
I GOT A FEELER
FROM HELLO AMERICA.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.749
NATIONAL.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.451
THEY'RE
LOOKING AT 20 GUYS,

37:32.484 --> 37:34.320
BUT THEY'LL CUT DOWN
TO THREE SOON.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.954
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

37:35.987 --> 37:39.291
THE SALARY'S GREAT.
IT'S REAL STRONG.

37:41.793 --> 37:42.794
IT WOULD MEAN MOVING,

37:42.828 --> 37:45.564
BUT I'D LIKE
TO MOVE EVERYBODY,

37:45.597 --> 37:47.399
RENEW THINGS WITH NOREEN.

37:47.433 --> 37:50.001
WE'VE BEEN SEEING SOMEBODY.

37:51.002 --> 37:56.007
LET THE KIDS
START OVER IN NEW YORK,

37:56.041 --> 37:56.742
KEEP THEM AWAY FROM

37:56.775 --> 37:59.511
SOME OF
THE BAD INFLUENCES HERE.

37:59.545 --> 38:02.314
JUST GET A FRESH START.

38:02.348 --> 38:05.651
I THINK
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

38:05.684 --> 38:06.952
THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC.

38:06.985 --> 38:07.919
YEAH.

38:07.953 --> 38:11.590
YOU COULD
REDEDICATE YOURSELVES,

38:11.623 --> 38:13.692
KNUCKLE DOWN.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.570
WHAT'S THIS?

38:26.438 --> 38:28.306
IT'S A BIG GULP.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.817
YOU SHOULD SAY
WE MIGHT SEE SOME SNOW.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.953
BUT IT MIGHT SHIFT SOUTH
AND MISS US.

38:41.987 --> 38:45.056
I CAN SAY IT, BUT I
SORT OF WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.925
WHY IS IT?

38:46.958 --> 38:49.595
WELL, IT'S
CANADIAN TRADE WINDS.

38:49.628 --> 38:50.762
BEHIND ALL OF IT?

38:50.796 --> 38:53.865
THIS WILL GET PUSHED
BY WIND OUT OF CANADA.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.601
SO, WHAT'S IT
GOING TO DO?

38:55.634 --> 38:59.104
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A GUESS.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.106
IT'S WIND, MAN.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.842
BLOWS ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

39:03.875 --> 39:07.746
Dave: FOR SOME REASON,
I DON'T KNOW...

39:07.779 --> 39:11.617
I WENT BACK
TO BOLLING BROOK.

39:11.650 --> 39:14.453
I BOUGHT
A THREE-MONTH LESSON PLAN.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.988
HANG ON.
BEFORE YOU DO THAT,

39:17.022 --> 39:19.458
LET'S GO OUT HERE AND DO
SOME STRETCHING EXERCISES.

39:19.491 --> 39:20.859
ROTATE.

39:20.892 --> 39:25.130
Dave: WE WARM UP...
AND DO BASIC FOCUS DRILLS,

39:25.163 --> 39:26.598
STUFF YOU NEVER THINK ABOUT,

39:26.632 --> 39:29.401
LIKE CLOSING AN EYE
WITHOUT MOVING YOUR FACE

39:29.435 --> 39:31.437
BECAUSE YOUR FACE

39:31.470 --> 39:33.672
IS THE ANCHOR POINT
FOR YOUR HAND

39:33.705 --> 39:35.974
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FOCUS.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.746
YOU HAVE
TO KEEP YOUR TRIANGLE

39:40.779 --> 39:43.148
AGAINST A LOT OF FORCE.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.734
WE DO DRAWS
FOR A HALF-HOUR,

40:02.768 --> 40:03.835
THEN RELEASES.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.972
THAT'S CALLED LOOSING,
WHEN YOU RELEASE.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.822
GOOD SHOT!

40:26.057 --> 40:28.927
Dave: IT'S HARD,
BUT THAT ONE GOOD SHOT

40:28.960 --> 40:31.863
LEAVES YOU THINKING
YOU MIGHT BE CATCHING ON.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.800
DO YOU LIFT WEIGHTS?

40:34.833 --> 40:36.201
WHAT'S THAT?

40:36.234 --> 40:37.536
DO YOU LIFT WEIGHTS?

40:37.569 --> 40:39.538
YEAH.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.672
CARDIO?

40:40.706 --> 40:41.973
YEAH, YOU HAVE
TO DO BOTH.

40:42.007 --> 40:47.579
YEAH. ARE YOU ON
ANY KIND OF A PROGRAM?

40:47.613 --> 40:49.815
YEAH, OUR GYM COACH
GAVE US A PROGRAM.

40:49.848 --> 40:52.684
THAT SHOULD BE GOOD.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.219
YEAH.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.654
YEAH.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.856
FUCK...

40:57.889 --> 41:02.027
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE INTERESTING?

41:02.060 --> 41:02.728
WHAT?

41:02.761 --> 41:04.730
WE SHOULD
TAKE SOME PICTURES,

41:04.763 --> 41:05.831
SOME SHOTS.

41:05.864 --> 41:07.933
LIKE, SOME NOW,
SOME IN A MONTH,

41:07.966 --> 41:10.235
SEE IF
YOU'RE MAKING GAINS.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.703
YEAH.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.572
I GOT
MY MOM'S NIKON.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.707
WHIP YOUR SHIRT OFF.

41:15.741 --> 41:17.242
WHIP MY SHIRT OFF?

41:17.275 --> 41:19.010
YEAH.

41:27.853 --> 41:31.857
(TRAIN RUMBLES OUTSIDE)

41:35.160 --> 41:37.128
YOU'RE SHREDDED!

41:37.162 --> 41:39.998
(CAMERA CLICKING)

41:41.767 --> 41:43.902
THIS IS GREAT, MAN.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.605
WE CAN COMPARE THIS SHIT.

41:46.638 --> 41:48.139
THAT'S A NIKON FM?

41:48.173 --> 41:51.977
YEAH. YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT CAMERAS?

41:52.010 --> 41:55.180
YEAH, I TOOK A CLASS
AT PARKER.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.583
COUPLE MORE?

42:00.686 --> 42:02.554
MY DAD'S GOING TO GET
THE F-3 FOR ME

42:02.588 --> 42:03.555
IF I CAN FINISH
THE PROGRAM

42:03.589 --> 42:05.056
AND MAINTAIN
A "B" AVERAGE.

42:05.090 --> 42:08.760
IT'S LIKE A $600 CAMERA.
I'M PSYCHED ABOUT IT.

42:08.794 --> 42:10.261
I COULD
LOAN THAT TO YOU.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.631
YEAH?

42:12.664 --> 42:13.899
I COULD LOAN
THAT SHIT TO YOU

42:13.932 --> 42:17.535
IF YOU WANTED IT
EARLIER.

42:18.804 --> 42:20.205
OK.

42:28.914 --> 42:32.050
THIS IS GOING
TO GO A LOT BETTER.

42:32.083 --> 42:32.884
WHY?

42:32.918 --> 42:35.587
BECAUSE I GOT YOU
SOME BOBTAIL ARROWS.

42:35.621 --> 42:37.155
THEY'RE EASIER.

42:37.188 --> 42:38.657
WHY?

42:38.690 --> 42:40.859
THEY'RE THICKER
AT THE ENDS.

42:40.892 --> 42:44.162
SEE. THEY TAPER
TOWARD THE NOCK.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.196
WHAT'S THE NOCK?

42:45.230 --> 42:46.932
THE ARROW END.

42:46.965 --> 42:48.667
WHAT WAS I USING BEFORE?

42:48.700 --> 42:50.936
CHESTED ARROWS.

42:50.969 --> 42:54.005
THAT GUY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

42:58.209 --> 43:02.080
OK, FLETCH IT.

43:02.113 --> 43:02.848
WHAT?

43:02.881 --> 43:07.018
FIX YOUR ARROW IN.
THAT'S THE TERM.

43:07.052 --> 43:09.721
ARROW-MAKERS
WERE CALLED "FLETCHERS."

43:09.755 --> 43:11.156
THAT'S WHERE
THE LAST NAME CAME FROM.

43:11.189 --> 43:14.760
HERE, IT'S
A LITTLE BIT OF UH...

43:14.793 --> 43:16.227
IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.997
RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT BELOW THE NOCK.

43:19.831 --> 43:23.869
THERE...AWESOME!

43:23.902 --> 43:26.404
OK, LET'S LOOSE A FEW.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.040
LET'S SHOW OUR STUFF.

43:29.074 --> 43:32.678
AIM ABOUT
A HALF-FOOT ABOVE.

43:32.711 --> 43:33.712
OK...

43:33.745 --> 43:35.313
WAIT UNTIL
YOU'RE STEADY.

43:35.346 --> 43:36.882
ARE YOU ALIGNED?

43:36.915 --> 43:37.916
YEAH.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.886
OK, LET IT GO.

43:40.919 --> 43:41.920
FUCK.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.790
COME ON, SHELLY.
GET YOUR ARROW.

43:44.823 --> 43:47.125
WE PROBABLY DIDN'T HOLD
LONG ENOUGH.

43:47.158 --> 43:50.896
THAT'S THE PAUSE BETWEEN
DRAWING BACK AND FIRING.

43:50.929 --> 43:54.299
LET'S PAUSE
A LITTLE LONGER.

43:56.301 --> 43:57.736
WHAT?

43:57.769 --> 43:59.838
NOTHING.

43:59.871 --> 44:02.207
ARE YOU JUST
NOT INTERESTED?

44:02.240 --> 44:03.942
YEAH.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.677
YEAH,
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED,

44:05.711 --> 44:06.712
OR YEAH,
YOU ARE INTERESTED?

44:06.745 --> 44:10.281
YEAH, I'M NOT...
REALLY.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.021
WHAT WAS IT YOU LIKED?

44:16.054 --> 44:17.756
LET'S THINK OF IT
THAT WAY.

44:17.789 --> 44:19.424
WHAT?

44:19.457 --> 44:20.926
WHAT INTERESTED YOU

44:20.959 --> 44:23.194
WHEN YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT ARCHERY?

44:23.228 --> 44:25.797
WHEN YOU WANTED
TO DO IT?

44:25.831 --> 44:27.833
I DON'T KNOW.

44:27.866 --> 44:30.168
GOING HUNTING OR SOMETHING.

44:30.201 --> 44:32.237
HUNTING?

44:32.270 --> 44:34.272
YEAH.

44:34.305 --> 44:36.274
FOR ANIMALS?

44:36.307 --> 44:38.409
YEAH.

44:38.443 --> 44:41.412
YOU WANT TO SHOOT
ANIMALS WITH ARROWS?

44:41.446 --> 44:42.413
YEAH.

44:42.447 --> 44:43.915
YOU DO?

44:43.949 --> 44:45.050
YEAH,
AND TO KILL THEM.

44:45.083 --> 44:49.020
BUT THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT ARCHERY,

44:49.054 --> 44:51.056
THAT'S HUNTING,
THAT'S CALLED BOW-HUNTING.

44:51.089 --> 44:52.924
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED
TO DO--BOW-HUNTING?

44:52.958 --> 44:55.460
YEAH,
I SAW IT ON TV.

44:57.195 --> 45:00.799
WELL, I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO KILL ANIMALS WITH ARROWS,

45:00.832 --> 45:02.033
SO THAT'S NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN.

45:02.067 --> 45:03.268
WE CAN TARGET SHOOT,
SHELLY.

45:03.301 --> 45:04.469
IT'S NOT FUN.

45:04.502 --> 45:05.470
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

45:05.503 --> 45:07.072
YOU HAVE TO APPLY
YOURSELF.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.206
TARGETS DON'T MOVE.

45:08.239 --> 45:10.141
WELL, YOU KNOW, SHELLY,

45:10.175 --> 45:12.410
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY
HIT ONE YET.

45:12.443 --> 45:13.779
YOU SHOULD SUPPORT ME.

45:13.812 --> 45:15.013
I DO SUPPORT YOU.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.183
I SUPPORT.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.221
ALL RIGHT, FORGET IT.
TAKE YOUR BRACER OFF.

45:23.254 --> 45:25.156
WE'RE NOT
SHOOTING ANYMORE.

45:25.190 --> 45:27.793
OK.

45:45.811 --> 45:49.014
THERE'S A CHANCE I MIGHT
BE GOING TO NEW YORK.

45:49.047 --> 45:51.049
A SMALL CHANCE.

45:51.082 --> 45:54.485
THINK YOU'D LIKE
TO COME MAYBE, IF I GO?

45:54.519 --> 45:56.054
YEAH.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.156
WE CAN MAYBE GO
WITH POP-POP.

45:58.189 --> 45:59.958
HE'S GOT SOME TESTS.

45:59.991 --> 46:02.260
YEAH.

46:46.171 --> 46:47.305
(KNOCK ON WINDOW)

46:47.338 --> 46:49.040
HEY.

46:49.074 --> 46:51.076
HEY, MIKE.

46:51.109 --> 46:52.377
YOU DON'T
LOOK REAL GOOD, DAD.

46:52.410 --> 46:54.079
YOU OK?

46:54.112 --> 46:55.847
YEAH.

46:55.881 --> 46:56.915
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

46:56.948 --> 46:58.416
JUST SITTING HERE.

46:58.449 --> 47:02.187
SOMETIMES I JUST SIT HERE,
LOOK AT THE HOUSE.

47:02.220 --> 47:04.455
YOU PARK HERE SOMETIMES?

47:04.489 --> 47:05.991
YEAH, SOMETIMES.

47:06.024 --> 47:08.960
I JUST LIKE
TO SEE YOU GUYS.

47:08.994 --> 47:10.962
I SEE YOU PLAYING
GUITAR UP THERE.

47:10.996 --> 47:12.864
OK.

47:12.898 --> 47:13.965
SOUNDS GOOD.

47:13.999 --> 47:16.234
THANKS.

47:17.035 --> 47:18.403
YOU KNOW POP-POP...

47:18.436 --> 47:19.437
YEAH.

47:19.470 --> 47:20.939
HE'S SICK.

47:20.972 --> 47:22.440
MOM SAID.

47:22.473 --> 47:25.877
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

47:28.546 --> 47:30.916
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A BOW AND ARROW IN THERE?

47:30.949 --> 47:33.885
OH, I WAS JUST OUT
WITH SHELLY.

47:33.919 --> 47:34.852
I'M NOT
PLAYING FAVORITES,

47:34.886 --> 47:37.923
I JUST THINK WE NEED
TO BE TOGETHER FOR AWHILE.

47:37.956 --> 47:40.191
YEAH, THAT'S OK.

47:40.225 --> 47:41.592
HOW'S YOUR PROGRAM
GOING?

47:41.626 --> 47:43.895
GREAT.

47:50.301 --> 47:52.237
YOU'RE GOING
TO GET THAT CAMERA

47:52.270 --> 47:54.272
IF YOU KEEP IT UP!

47:58.343 --> 48:01.179
Dave:
LOOK AT THIS HOUSE.

48:01.212 --> 48:04.015
SOMEONE
SHOULD BE HAPPY HERE.

48:04.049 --> 48:06.184
HOW DID I FUCK THIS UP?

48:06.217 --> 48:08.519
SERIOUSLY.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.989
WHAT IF I REMEMBERED
THE TARTAR SAUCE?

48:11.022 --> 48:13.491
WOULD THINGS BE DIFFERENT?

48:13.524 --> 48:17.128
WOULD ROBERT DIE
NOT THINKING I'M A JERK-OFF?

48:17.162 --> 48:19.097
JERK-FUCK.

48:19.130 --> 48:21.699
DON'T FORGET
THE TARTAR SAUCE.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.434
CALL THE ORDER IN,
NOREEN,

48:23.468 --> 48:25.403
AND QUIT BUSTING
MY YOU-KNOW-WHAT, OK?

48:25.436 --> 48:28.306
YOU ALWAYS HALF-LISTEN
TO WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU.

48:28.339 --> 48:30.575
I HEARD YOU!
TARTAR SAUCE.

48:34.379 --> 48:37.648
Dave: TARTAR SAUCE,
TARTAR SAUCE, TARTAR SAUCE.

48:37.682 --> 48:41.519
TARTAR SAUCE, TARTAR SAUCE,
TARTAR SAUCE.

48:44.455 --> 48:47.025
MAN, I WOULD LIKE TO PUT
MY FACE IN THERE.

48:47.058 --> 48:50.495
RIGHT IN THERE...
TARTAR SAUCE.

48:50.528 --> 48:54.332
MY HIPS ARE COLD...
TARTAR SAUCE.

48:54.365 --> 48:55.466
THAT'S WHEN
YOU KNOW IT'S COLD.

48:55.500 --> 48:58.103
I LIKE EATING PUSSY...
TARTAR SAUCE.

48:58.136 --> 48:59.404
A LOT OF GUYS DON'T--
MAYBE THEY DO.

48:59.437 --> 49:00.571
MAYBE THAT'S
JUST BLACK GUYS.

49:00.605 --> 49:01.406
TARTAR SAUCE.

49:01.439 --> 49:03.441
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GUY
WHO WAS TRYING

49:03.474 --> 49:05.043
TO GO AROUND THE WORLD
IN A BALLOON?

49:05.076 --> 49:06.044
DID HE MAKE IT?

49:06.077 --> 49:07.545
I SHOULD PUT SOME ESPIONAGE
OR STOLEN PLUTONIUM

49:07.578 --> 49:08.413
IN MY NOVEL...
TARTAR SAUCE.

49:08.446 --> 49:12.183
SPICE IT UP. NEIL YOUNG.
FUCK, IT'S COLD.

49:12.217 --> 49:15.086
NEIL YOUNG...WHY AM I
THINKING ABOUT NEIL YOUNG?

49:15.120 --> 49:16.287
NEIL DIAMOND.

49:16.321 --> 49:17.188
THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF FAMOUS NEILS.

49:17.222 --> 49:19.724
IS THIS WEDNESDAY?
I WISH I HAD TWO DICKS.

49:19.757 --> 49:20.725
I THOUGHT
THE WHOLE FAMILY

49:20.758 --> 49:23.061
WAS GOING TO LEARN SPANISH
TOGETHER THIS SUMMER.

49:23.094 --> 49:24.129
THAT NEVER REALLY HAPPENED.

49:24.162 --> 49:25.130
I HAVEN'T HAD
A SPANISH OMELET

49:25.163 --> 49:26.064
IN A LONG TIME.

49:26.097 --> 49:27.732
HERE WE GO.

49:31.369 --> 49:32.470
ANYTHING ELSE?

49:32.503 --> 49:34.705
NO.

49:39.110 --> 49:41.246
WHERE IS
THE TARTAR SAUCE?

49:42.513 --> 49:45.750
THEY WERE OUT.
THEY APOLOGIZED.

49:45.783 --> 49:47.352
THEY WERE COOL
ABOUT IT.

49:47.385 --> 49:49.554
THEY WERE OUT?

49:49.587 --> 49:51.089
THEY WERE OUT.

49:51.122 --> 49:54.125
THEY WERE OUT
OF TARTAR SAUCE?

49:54.159 --> 49:57.062
I'M CALLING THEM.

49:57.095 --> 49:59.364
FUCK, NOREEN...

49:59.397 --> 50:02.133
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE TARTAR SAUCE!

50:02.167 --> 50:03.434
IT'S ABOUT YOU!
YOU DON'T CARE!

50:03.468 --> 50:04.669
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT TARTAR SAUCE!

50:04.702 --> 50:06.471
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING
FOR THIS FAMILY!

50:06.504 --> 50:08.573
I GOT MORE THINGS
TO THINK ABOUT, PRESSURE.

50:08.606 --> 50:11.276
TARTAR SAUCE? FUCK, NOREEN,
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

50:11.309 --> 50:12.610
YOU ARE SO SELFISH.

50:14.179 --> 50:16.547
(ARGUING CONTINUES)

50:21.119 --> 50:24.655
(TURNS UP VOLUME)

50:24.689 --> 50:29.394
(ARGUING CONTINUES)

50:29.427 --> 50:31.662
YOU THINK I'M A MORON?
THEY'RE OUT.

50:31.696 --> 50:33.798
(CRUNCHING)

50:33.831 --> 50:36.367
Dave: WE BOTH JUST THINK
IT'S BETTER FOR THE KIDS.

50:36.401 --> 50:41.106
DAVID, SACRIFICE IS--

50:42.473 --> 50:45.776
TO GET ANYTHING OF VALUE,

50:45.810 --> 50:47.678
YOU HAVE TO SACRIFICE.

50:47.712 --> 50:48.579
I KNOW THAT, DAD,

50:48.613 --> 50:50.515
BUT I THINK IF WE
CONTINUE DOWN THIS ROAD,

50:50.548 --> 50:52.483
IT'LL BE TOO DETRIMENTAL
FOR THE KIDS.

50:52.517 --> 50:53.784
IT'S JUST TOO HARD.

50:53.818 --> 50:56.421
DO YOU KNOW THAT
THE HARDER THING TO DO,

50:56.454 --> 50:59.090
AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

50:59.124 --> 51:01.426
ARE USUALLY
THE SAME THING?

51:01.459 --> 51:05.496
NOTHING THAT HAS MEANING
IS EASY.

51:05.530 --> 51:09.534
EASY DOESN'T ENTER INTO
GROWN-UP LIFE.

51:24.749 --> 51:27.752
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH
AN 18-DEGREE VARIANCE.

51:27.785 --> 51:29.187
WHY EVEN FORECAST?

51:29.220 --> 51:31.256
IT'S A TECHNICAL ART,
NOT A SCIENCE.

51:31.289 --> 51:32.423
PEOPLE GET THAT.

51:32.457 --> 51:33.624
LET'S NARROW IT DOWN,
TIM.

51:33.658 --> 51:37.595
DAVE, IT'S RANDOM.
WE DO OUR BEST.

51:37.628 --> 51:40.731
A DAY CAN HAVE
THAT VARIANCE.

51:42.233 --> 51:43.401
DAVE, PHONE CALL.

51:43.434 --> 51:44.402
TAKE A MESSAGE.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.504
IT'S HELLO AMERICA.

52:08.826 --> 52:10.895
CAN WE SHOP HERE?

52:10.928 --> 52:13.264
SURE. WHERE IS THAT?

52:13.298 --> 52:14.265
BENDEL.

52:14.299 --> 52:15.866
ALL RIGHT.

52:27.945 --> 52:29.480
DAD.

52:30.448 --> 52:32.450
(CAMEL SNORTS)

52:32.483 --> 52:34.419
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET'S GO FOR A WALK,

52:34.452 --> 52:35.920
TAKE A BREAK.

52:35.953 --> 52:37.522
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

52:37.555 --> 52:39.624
MAYBE WE'LL
COME BACK LATER.

52:39.657 --> 52:42.227
WE'LL JUST TAKE A BREAK.

52:43.994 --> 52:46.664
SO, HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING?

52:46.697 --> 52:48.233
GOOD.

52:48.266 --> 52:49.300
HOW'S SCHOOL?

52:49.334 --> 52:50.501
GOOD.

52:50.535 --> 52:51.736
DANCE SCHOOL?

52:51.769 --> 52:53.471
GOOD.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.740
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL,

52:55.773 --> 52:58.676
THE HARDEST THING
WAS HOW OTHER KIDS

52:58.709 --> 53:01.379
CAN BE A LITTLE MEAN.

53:01.412 --> 53:04.615
NAMES AND STUFF.

53:05.483 --> 53:07.952
DO YOU EVER
GET CALLED NAMES?

53:07.985 --> 53:10.421
LIKE WHAT?

53:10.455 --> 53:11.222
I DON'T KNOW.

53:11.256 --> 53:14.225
LIKE, DUMMY
IF YOU MISS A QUESTION.

53:14.259 --> 53:15.593
OR CAMEL-TOE.

53:15.626 --> 53:19.464
YEAH, CAMEL-TOE.

53:20.298 --> 53:21.966
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

53:21.999 --> 53:24.435
WHY WHAT?

53:24.469 --> 53:27.004
WHY YOU GET CALLED
CAMEL-TOE?

53:27.037 --> 53:30.841
YEAH.

53:30.875 --> 53:33.644
WHY, HON?

53:33.678 --> 53:37.815
BECAUSE...
CAMEL-TOES ARE TOUGH.

53:37.848 --> 53:40.351
THEY CAN WALK
ALL OVER THE DESERT

53:40.385 --> 53:42.387
AND ALL THE HOT ROCKS.

53:42.420 --> 53:43.954
I'M TOUGH.

53:47.458 --> 53:51.696
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S
BECAUSE THEY'RE TOUGH.

53:52.463 --> 53:54.499
READY TO SHOP AGAIN?

53:59.537 --> 54:02.840
I THINK THEY MAKE CAR TIRES
OUT OF CAMEL-TOES.

54:02.873 --> 54:07.445
YEAH.
I THINK I HEARD THAT.

54:07.478 --> 54:09.347
I JUST THINK
YOU'RE MORE GROWN UP

54:09.380 --> 54:10.481
THAN THAT OTHER STUFF.

54:10.515 --> 54:12.350
I DON'T THINK
I LIKE IT.

54:12.383 --> 54:14.352
THAT WAS SORT OF
KID STUFF.

54:14.385 --> 54:17.955
I LIKE THIS DRESS.
IT'S NEW YORK STYLE.

54:17.988 --> 54:19.990
LET ME SEE.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.499
HEY.

54:28.533 --> 54:30.468
YOU LIKE IT?

54:30.501 --> 54:31.636
I LIKE IT, YEAH.

54:31.669 --> 54:33.404
DO YOU LIKE IT?

54:33.438 --> 54:35.773
YEAH,
I THINK I DO.

54:35.806 --> 54:36.907
DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE
IN IT?

54:36.941 --> 54:38.909
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S THE THING.

54:38.943 --> 54:41.346
YEAH, IT'S COMFY.

54:41.379 --> 54:43.514
YOU LOOK GREAT.

54:43.548 --> 54:44.682
YOU LOOK ALL GROWN UP.

54:44.715 --> 54:47.485
OK, CHANGE.
LET'S GET SOME MORE.

54:47.518 --> 54:48.953

54:48.986 --> 54:52.990
SURE. THEN WE'LL GO SHOW
POP-POP SOME OF THIS STUFF.

55:17.582 --> 55:19.417
(DOOR OPENS)

55:19.450 --> 55:22.953
POP-POP...POP-POP?

55:22.987 --> 55:24.489
CHECK THIS OUT.

55:24.522 --> 55:25.823
THAT'S NICE, HON.

55:25.856 --> 55:28.926
I KNOW.
I GOT A LOT MORE, TOO.

55:30.060 --> 55:32.029
DAVE...

55:32.062 --> 55:33.431
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

55:33.464 --> 55:34.565
I'M ALL RIGHT.

55:34.599 --> 55:37.968
MIKE GOT ARRESTED.

55:38.002 --> 55:39.904
WHAT?

55:39.937 --> 55:42.873
HE FUCKED HIS
DRUG COUNSELOR'S CAR UP.

55:42.907 --> 55:45.476
THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY
TO A MOVIE.

55:45.510 --> 55:47.612
OH...

55:50.415 --> 55:52.750
A MOVIE?

55:55.753 --> 55:59.824
MIKE SAID HE WAS TRYING
TO SUCK HIM OFF.

55:59.857 --> 56:02.727
THEN MIKE CHUCKED A ROCK

56:02.760 --> 56:05.396
THROUGH HIS CAR'S
PASSENGER WINDOW.

56:06.163 --> 56:10.100
WHAT IS THIS SUCKING
AND CHUCKING ROCKS?

56:10.134 --> 56:12.069
I MEAN, WHAT IS THIS?

56:12.102 --> 56:14.672
WHAT DID THE GUY SAY?

56:14.705 --> 56:19.143
HE SAID MIKE
TRIED TO JACK HIS WALLET.

56:24.515 --> 56:26.617
WHAT IS THIS
SUCKING AND CHUCKING

56:26.651 --> 56:29.487
AND JACKING
AND FUCKING UP, SON?

56:29.520 --> 56:31.456
HE'S 15 YEARS OLD!

56:31.489 --> 56:33.791
WHAT IS THIS SHIT?

56:34.725 --> 56:36.026
WHERE IS HE?

56:36.060 --> 56:37.762
HE'S AT HOME.

56:37.795 --> 56:39.630
WHAT IS THIS?

56:39.664 --> 56:41.932
FUCK.

56:50.941 --> 56:53.511
YOU READY
FOR THE DOCTOR'S?

56:53.544 --> 56:55.680
YEAH.

56:55.713 --> 56:59.584
(SHOOTING SOUNDS)
GOT YA...

56:59.617 --> 57:00.918
DEAD.

57:00.951 --> 57:02.820
I THINK JUST WHAT HE SAID
HAPPENED, HAPPENED.

57:02.853 --> 57:04.054
THE GUY WAS TRYING
TO MAKE A MOVE ON HIM

57:04.088 --> 57:06.891
AND MIKE GOT SURPRISED
AND SCARED.

57:06.924 --> 57:10.661
HON, WILL YOU GET ME
A POP FROM THE MACHINE?

57:10.695 --> 57:12.763
Noreen: CAN YOU GET
YOUR POP LATER?

57:12.797 --> 57:14.699
I'M TRYING
TO SEND SHELLY AWAY

57:14.732 --> 57:15.733
SO SHE DOESN'T
HAVE TO HEAR THIS.

57:15.766 --> 57:20.004
THIS GUY SAID THAT MIKE
TRIED TO STEAL HIS WALLET,

57:20.037 --> 57:21.506
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY WERE FIGHTING

57:21.539 --> 57:23.073
WHEN THE POLICE CAME.

57:23.107 --> 57:24.775
HOW IS HE?

57:24.809 --> 57:27.044
HE'S SCARED.
I DON'T KNOW.

57:27.077 --> 57:29.947
I CAN COME HOME.

57:29.980 --> 57:33.651
NO, STAY THERE AND DO
YOUR HELLO AMERICA THING.

57:33.684 --> 57:35.553
YOU ACT LIKE--

57:35.586 --> 57:36.887
WHAT?

57:36.921 --> 57:38.088
LIKE MIKE'S IN TROUBLE

57:38.122 --> 57:39.824
BECAUSE I'M INTERVIEWING
AT HELLO AMERICA!

57:39.857 --> 57:43.127
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

57:46.531 --> 57:47.765
Noreen:
RUSS IS HELPING ANYWAY.

57:47.798 --> 57:49.700
THAT DILDO'S WHAT?

57:49.734 --> 57:51.769
HE'S BEEN A BIG HELP, OK?

57:51.802 --> 57:52.837
YOU CAN STAY THERE.

57:52.870 --> 57:54.672
FINE! I'LL STAY HERE
WITH CAMEL-TOE,

57:54.705 --> 57:57.074
YOU JUST TAKE CARE
OF STUFF THERE!

57:57.107 --> 57:59.143
CAMEL-TOE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

57:59.176 --> 57:59.910
I HAD TO FIND OUT

57:59.944 --> 58:02.012
HOW KIDS TAUNT SHELLY
ABOUT THAT.

58:02.046 --> 58:03.013
YOU'RE NOT
PAYING ATTENTION

58:03.047 --> 58:03.848
TO THE WAY
SHE GOES TO SCHOOL.

58:03.881 --> 58:06.684
I TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING AROUND HERE.

58:06.717 --> 58:07.685
I BOUGHT HER NEW STUFF.

58:07.718 --> 58:09.119
A BUNCH
OF BRAND-NEW STUFF.

58:09.153 --> 58:11.589
SHE TOLD ME
ALL KINDS OF STUFF.

58:11.622 --> 58:12.590
DON'T BE SUCH A DICK.

58:12.623 --> 58:13.658
YOU HAVE HER
FOR ONE WEEKEND!

58:13.691 --> 58:15.860
YOU KNOW WHAT, NOREEN?
JUST--

58:15.893 --> 58:17.862
FUCK! WHATEVER.

58:17.895 --> 58:19.530
LET ME TALK TO MIKE.

58:19.564 --> 58:20.230
HE'S SLEEPING.

58:20.264 --> 58:21.732
AND DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT.

58:21.766 --> 58:24.001
MORE DILDO,
MORE FUCKING.

58:24.034 --> 58:27.572
LISTEN, I HAVE TO GO.
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

58:27.605 --> 58:29.506
WHATEVER.

58:30.575 --> 58:31.542
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TRYING

58:31.576 --> 58:33.578
TO IMPROVE MATTERS
WITH NOREEN--

58:33.611 --> 58:34.745
IF NOT RECONCILE.

58:34.779 --> 58:36.847
I AM.
WHAT DID FROST SAY?

58:36.881 --> 58:39.850
HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO ME
IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

58:39.884 --> 58:41.085
IT WAS COLD IN THERE.

58:41.118 --> 58:43.754
WOULD YOU GET ME
A COFFEE, DAVE,

58:43.788 --> 58:45.055
SO I CAN WARM UP?

58:45.089 --> 58:47.224
YEAH, DAD.

59:00.771 --> 59:02.306
HI.

59:02.339 --> 59:04.208
HI. 65.

59:06.611 --> 59:08.178
FUCK.

59:11.048 --> 59:12.016
HEY.

59:12.049 --> 59:12.850
HI.

59:12.883 --> 59:14.184
POP-POP WENT IN?

59:14.218 --> 59:15.052
YEAH.

59:15.085 --> 59:18.589
HE WANTED A COFFEE.
YOU HAVE MY WALLET?

59:21.826 --> 59:24.294
YOU ONLY HAD A DOLLAR.

59:24.328 --> 59:27.364
YOU SHOULD CARRY
MORE MONEY THAN THAT.

59:27.397 --> 59:29.834
I KNOW.

59:40.210 --> 59:44.114
WELL, DID HE SAY WHETHER
ANY MORE THERAPY COULD--

59:44.148 --> 59:46.784
NO, HE DIDN'T HAVE
A DIFFERENT OPINION

59:46.817 --> 59:48.686
THAN PRITCH.

59:48.719 --> 59:52.790
THERE'S TWO LARGE
PLANES.

59:52.823 --> 59:56.627
IT'S A NO-GO.

59:56.661 --> 59:57.762
DID HE SAY--

59:57.795 --> 01:00:01.165
HE SAID MONTHS.

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:03.300
DID HE SAY
A LOT OF MONTHS, OR--

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.870
WHAT'S A LOT?

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:09.239
I DON'T KNOW.
LIKE 12.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:10.875
IF HE MEANT 12,

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:13.878
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
SAID A YEAR, SON.

01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:18.615
I THINK HE MEANT
THREE OR FOUR.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.704
WELL, YOU HAVE
A BIG DAY TOMORROW.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:43.373
THE HELLO AMERICA SHOW.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:46.076
YEAH.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:48.005
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:01:50.007 --> 01:01:51.909
Male announcer: HERE
COMES THE GRAND MARSHAL,

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:52.977
DAVE SPRITZEL.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.078
Female announcer: DIDN'T
HIS NAME USED TO BE SPRITZ?

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:58.082
YEAH, BUT HE CHANGED IT BACK
TO THE ORIGINAL SPRITZEL.

01:01:58.115 --> 01:01:59.149
WHY'D HE CHANGE IT?

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:00.818
WELL,
WHEN YOU'RE NATIONAL,

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:01.852
THERE'S NO MORE UP,

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:02.853
SO HE CHANGED IT BACK,

01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:04.354
LIKE
JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:06.757
HE'S REALER NOW
AND MORE AUTHENTIC.

01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:08.092
WHO'S THAT WITH HIM?

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:10.094
THOSE ARE
THE WIFE AND KIDS.

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:12.462
DIDN'T HE USED TO HAVE
A REAL FUCKED-UP RELATIONSHIP?

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:13.263
NOT ANYMORE.

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:14.932
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT CHANGED.

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:17.101
IT SEEMS HELLO AMERICA
WITH BRYANT GUMBEL

01:02:17.134 --> 01:02:18.869
GAVE THEM ALL
A FRESH START.

01:02:18.903 --> 01:02:21.906
AND AN INCREASE IN SALARY
TO $980,000

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:24.074
OUTSIDE OF PROMOTIONAL FEES

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.376
PUTS DAVE WELL OVER
$1 MILLION A YEAR.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:29.446
THAT GOT HIS WIFE'S EAR,
I BET.

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:32.883
THAT BUYS A LOT.
NOW EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:37.254
(CONTINUES INDISTINCT)

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:19.263
HELLO, AMERICA.

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:24.601
Female executive:
WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:28.205
WRITING. ARCHERY.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:35.112
AND YOU DON'T HAVE A DEGREE
IN METEOROLOGY?

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.447

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:43.187
OK.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.923
WE THINK YOU'RE GREAT.
REFRESHING.

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:48.292
WE LOVE
THE SPRITZ NIPPER.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.326
GREAT.

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.527
WHY DON'T WE RUN
SOME BLUE SCREEN,

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.996
AND WE'LL DO
A WALK-THROUGH ON THE SET?

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:54.098
GREAT.

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:02.506
HERE'S YOUR STATION.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:03.207
WE'LL RUN SOME SCREEN.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.876
GIVE ME A SECOND
TO SET IT UP.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:16.520
(MACHINE BUZZING)

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:33.938
HI.

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:35.005

BRYANT.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.377
NERVOUS?

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.512
NO.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:43.613
SURE?

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:44.248
YEAH.

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:46.951
JUST A LITTLE BIT
NERVOUS?

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:49.219
IT'S NOT NERVES.

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:50.454
OTHER SHIT.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:52.289
YEAH.

01:04:56.026 --> 01:04:57.261
MILD IN THE NORTHWEST.

01:04:57.294 --> 01:04:59.229

SYSTEM GIVES WAY

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:00.264
WE'LL SEE
WARM TEMPERATURES...

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:02.499
Dave: I KNOW
IT'S NOT NEURO-SURGERY.

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.401
THE GREEN SCREEN'S
THE ONE PART OF MY JOB

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:05.669
THAT'S NOT REALLY EASY.

01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:08.138
35 IN NEW YORK
WITH COLDER TEMPERATURES...

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:09.273
Dave: YOU NEED A SENSE

01:05:09.306 --> 01:05:11.341
OF WHERE PUT-ONS
WILL COME FROM

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.443
AND A PRETTY STRONG
SENSE OF SCALE.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.547
I'VE GOTTEN
REAL GOOD AT IT.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:21.451

WE'RE A LITTLE LATE

01:05:32.296 --> 01:05:33.697

WE KEPT YOU LATE.

01:05:34.999 --> 01:05:35.632

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:37.401
SO,

WHAT'S A BUILT-IN?

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:45.442
A COMPULSORY ENDORSEMENT
IF I'M OFFERED THE JOB.

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:46.376

01:05:50.214 --> 01:05:52.082
DAVE DOESN'T OWN
A PET.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:54.384
WELL, I HAVE JACKSON.

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:58.288

STILL PRETTY UPSET ABOUT IT.

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:40.764
DID HE TALK ABOUT IT?

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:48.172
HE WAS WITH HIS COUNSELOR,
DON BOWDEN--

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:49.539
Dave: I DON'T
REALLY KNOW WHY

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:52.242
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
HAPPENED.

01:06:52.276 --> 01:06:54.144
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT MY SON

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:56.546
AND I WAS TAKING
MY GLOVES OFF...

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.049
APPARENTLY THEY WERE
GOING TO A MOVIE--

01:06:59.083 --> 01:06:59.816
WHAT THE FUCK?

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.085
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:02.386

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:03.653
I'M HELPING NOREEN.

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:04.688
WHY ARE YOU HELPING?

DAVE!

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:15.665
Dave:
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:18.635
IF YOU WANT YOUR FATHER TO THINK
YOU'RE NOT A SILLY FUCK,

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:21.071
DON'T SLAP A GUY ACROSS
THE FACE WITH A GLOVE.

01:07:21.105 --> 01:07:24.741
BECAUSE, IF YOU DO THAT,
THAT'S WHAT HE WILL THINK,

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:25.475
UNLESS YOU'RE A NOBLEMAN

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:28.312

I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:52.075
IT'S A PRETTY
SUBSTANTIAL SALARY.

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:54.544
AND THE VENUE,
IT'S BIG.

01:11:54.578 --> 01:11:57.313

YOU PLANE UP.

01:14:32.736 --> 01:14:34.838
BUT YOU HAVE
TO FACTOR IN WIND,

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:38.474
WHICH IS
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART.

THERE ARE TOO FEW LIKE HIM.

01:15:16.913 --> 01:15:21.084
AND NOW,
ROBERT'S SON DAVID.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.933
GOOD AFTERNOON.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:42.205
MANY OF YOU CAME
FROM LONG DISTANCES,

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:46.810
AND I KNOW I SPEAK
FOR MY MOM, NOREEN,

AND MY FAMILY--

THE POWER WENT OUT.

01:16:18.241 --> 01:16:22.045
THEN, WHEN THE LIGHTS
CAME BACK ON IN 40 MINUTES,

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.280
EVERYONE HAD
PRETTY MUCH FORGOTTEN

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:27.183
THAT I WAS TALKING.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.954
AND WE NEVER FINISHED
THAT PART OF THE THING.

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:34.157
SO MY SPEECH WAS,
"WHEN I THINK OF MY DAD,

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:37.827
I THINK OF BOB SEGER'S
LIKE A ROCK."

01:16:37.861 --> 01:16:41.798

IT WAS HOT.

THAT GETS TO PEOPLE,

01:19:03.006 --> 01:19:05.308
THAT LEADS TO PIES,
I GUESS,

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:08.144
ARE THESE CATCH-PHRASES

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:10.847
TO SINGLE THE PROGRAM OUT.

WITH STUFF,

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:25.261

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.201
I DOUBT IT.

01:19:32.235 --> 01:19:35.538
BUT THIS IS LIKE
THE NINTH TIME I GOT--

01:19:35.571 --> 01:19:38.441
CLOWNS GET HIT WITH PIES.

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:50.987
HEY!

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.121
FUCK!

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:55.491
I'M MIKE'S FATHER.
HERE'S YOUR SHIT!

01:20:04.067 --> 01:20:06.870
I SAW YOU BUY THIS
AT THE MALL ON NORTH AVENUE,

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:08.104
AND I'LL TELL THE COPS, TOO.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:09.839
SO YOU CAN CUT YOUR CRAP

01:20:09.873 --> 01:20:12.208
ABOUT MIKE
JACKING YOUR WALLET!

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:19.315
HE'S...JUST A KID.

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:24.187
HE LOOKS GROWN,
BUT HE'S JUST A KID!

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.090
YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:33.329
Dave: I MEAN, I'LL BET
NO ONE EVER THREW A PIE

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:35.999
AT LIKE HARRIET TUBMAN,

01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:38.201
THE FOUNDER OF
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD.

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:40.436
I'LL BET YOU
A MILLION FUCKING DOLLARS.

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:13.269
THE FIRST TIME I WAS
STRUCK WITH SOMETHING,

01:21:13.302 --> 01:21:17.173
A CHICKEN BREAST
FROM KENNY ROGERS',

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:20.576
I WAS STANDING NEXT TO
A GARBAGE PAIL.

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:22.979
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN ACCIDENT,

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:25.181
THAT THEY WERE
THROWING IT OUT.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:28.651
THE SECOND TIME, IT HIT ME
SQUARE ON THE CHIN--

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:30.553
A SOFT TACO.

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:34.690
THEN POP, A FALAFEL,

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.994
McNUGGETS,

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:41.630
ALWAYS FAST FOOD.

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:44.300
FAST FOOD.

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:47.703
SHIT PEOPLE WOULD RATHER
THROW OUT THAN FINISH.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.672
IT'S EASY,
IT TASTES ALL RIGHT,

01:21:49.705 --> 01:21:55.011
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY
PROVIDE YOU ANY NOURISHMENT.

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:58.447
I'M FAST FOOD.

01:21:58.481 --> 01:22:00.049
HEY.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:02.185
HEY.

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:06.722
DID YOU SEE HIM?

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.591
YEAH.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:11.294
AM I GOING
TO GET IN TROUBLE?

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:15.131
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:18.501
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:22.571
I GOT ON HIM.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:24.673
I LET HIM KNOW WE'RE NOT
MESSING AROUND.

01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:27.043
I WAILED ON HIM.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:29.045
WHAT?

01:22:29.078 --> 01:22:30.746
I CAUGHT HIM
ONE CLEAN ONE FOR SURE,

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:31.981
ON THE FOREHEAD,

01:22:32.015 --> 01:22:34.683
AND THEN I FUCKING
WAILED ON HIM.

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:36.385
SERIOUSLY?

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:39.088
HE'S NOT GOING TO SAY
YOU STOLE ANYTHING.

01:22:39.122 --> 01:22:41.957
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

01:22:49.132 --> 01:22:51.200
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

01:22:51.234 --> 01:22:52.968
CORN DOGS.

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:11.087
YOU'RE A KID, MIKE.
FUCK.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.255
I'M NOT A KID.

01:23:12.288 --> 01:23:13.256
YOU ARE A KID.

01:23:13.289 --> 01:23:15.458
DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN
GROWN-UP SITUATIONS AGAIN

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.626
UNTIL YOU'RE A GROWN-UP.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.228
OK.
OK?

01:23:19.262 --> 01:23:21.264
YEAH.

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:24.333
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET YOU A CORN DOG?

01:23:24.367 --> 01:23:27.270
WHAT? NO.

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:30.139
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:23:30.173 --> 01:23:32.375
NOTHING.

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.726
WEATHER MAN.

01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:00.069
HEY.

01:24:00.103 --> 01:24:01.470
HI.

01:24:02.205 --> 01:24:03.672
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.541
YEAH, YEAH.

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:08.677
UM, I JUST WANTED
YOU TO, UH--

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:10.146
WHAT?

01:24:10.179 --> 01:24:11.280
(TURNS MUSIC ON)

01:24:11.314 --> 01:24:12.281
(BOB SEGER'S
LIKE A ROCK PLAYS)

01:24:12.315 --> 01:24:13.816
* I WAS 18

01:24:13.849 --> 01:24:17.520
* DIDN'T HAVE A CARE

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:23.559
* WORKING FOR PEANUTS,
NOT A DIME TO SPARE *

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:27.730

I DON'T REALLY GET IT.

01:24:35.271 --> 01:24:38.407
AM I FOLLOWING?

01:24:38.441 --> 01:24:40.609
* MY EYES
WERE CLEAR AND BRIGHT *

01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:45.148
IT WAS JUST A LEAD UP TO
OTHER THINGS I WANTED TO SAY.

01:24:45.181 --> 01:24:46.382
HERE'S THE PART.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:51.720
* AND I HELD FIRM
TO WHAT I FELT WAS RIGHT *

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:54.323
* LIKE A ROCK

01:24:54.357 --> 01:24:57.260
I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT THAT PART.

01:24:57.293 --> 01:24:59.128
ABOUT YOU.

01:24:59.162 --> 01:25:01.330
JUST LIKE YOU.

I GOT THE JOB.

01:25:10.406 --> 01:25:14.177
NEW YORK?

01:25:14.210 --> 01:25:15.344
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

01:25:15.378 --> 01:25:16.712
THAT'S A REMARKABLE
INCOME.

01:25:16.745 --> 01:25:19.415
THAT'S MORE MONEY
THAN I EVER MADE,

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:21.217
THAT SALARY.

01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:22.618
YEAH.

01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:26.355
THAT'S QUITE AN AMERICAN
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

01:25:26.389 --> 01:25:30.293
THANKS.

01:25:30.326 --> 01:25:32.228
ARE YOU OK?

I STOOD TALL *

NOREEN'S MARRYING RUSS,

01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:46.742
THERE'S NOTHING
TO KNUCKLE DOWN ON, SO--

01:25:46.775 --> 01:25:50.546
I CAN'T FUCKING
KNUCKLE DOWN.

01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:54.817
YOUR HAND.

01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:59.922
I JUST SAW
MIKE'S COUNSELOR.

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:01.657
MIKE MENTIONED THAT

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:05.928
YOU WERE GOING TO FIX
HIS BUSINESS UP.

01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:08.231
HE'S IN NO TROUBLE?

01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:11.867
GOOD JOB.

01:26:18.441 --> 01:26:19.775
YOUR HAND OK?

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:21.810
YEAH, IT'S OK.

01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:22.811
YOU CERTAIN?

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:23.546
DON'T WORRY.

01:26:23.579 --> 01:26:28.551
YOU ALWAYS WORRY
ABOUT YOUR KIDS

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:31.254
NO MATTER HOW OLD.

01:26:31.287 --> 01:26:34.490
THERE'S ALWAYS
LOOKING AFTER.

01:26:45.601 --> 01:26:47.703
I READ YOUR BOOK.

01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:49.805
FUCK...

01:26:52.508 --> 01:26:54.977
I WAS GOING TO DO
SOME MORE WORK ON IT,

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.412
THEN I CHUCKED IT.

01:26:56.445 --> 01:26:57.980
YOU CHUCKED IT.

01:26:58.013 --> 01:27:01.517
GARBAGE.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:06.689
IT'S JUST--
WHAT I DO, DAVID.

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:09.358
I'VE PRACTICED
AND I'VE GOTTEN GOOD.

01:27:09.392 --> 01:27:11.927
LIKE YOU IN
THE WEATHER BUSINESS.

01:27:15.498 --> 01:27:17.366
BUT I DON'T PREDICT IT.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.967
NOBODY DOES
'CAUSE IT'S JUST WIND.

01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:21.570
IT'S WIND. IT BLOWS
ALL OVER THE PLACE!

01:27:21.604 --> 01:27:23.005
WHAT THE FUCK?

01:27:30.646 --> 01:27:33.382
I--HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:35.050
DAVID...

01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:41.390
(TURNS MUSIC OFF)

01:27:41.424 --> 01:27:44.560
IN THIS SHIT LIFE...

01:27:46.529 --> 01:27:49.898
WE MUST
CHUCK SOME THINGS.

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:56.572
WE MUST CHUCK THEM...

01:27:57.406 --> 01:27:59.274
IN THIS SHIT LIFE.

01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:09.552
THERE'S ALWAYS
LOOKING AFTER.

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:13.689
YOU HAVE TIME.

01:28:19.895 --> 01:28:21.764
THANKS.

01:29:18.421 --> 01:29:21.123
Dave: PRETTY SOON AFTER
ROBERT'S LIVING FUNERAL,

01:29:21.156 --> 01:29:23.892
WE HAD HIS REAL ONE.

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:23.786
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:28.957
THAT'S A LOVELY THING
TO SAY TO ME.

01:30:29.892 --> 01:30:31.560
WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

01:30:31.594 --> 01:30:33.996
HIS FRIENDS.

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:39.968
HEY.

01:30:40.969 --> 01:30:43.672
I'M GLAD ONE OF YOU
BROUGHT AN UMBRELLA.

01:30:43.706 --> 01:30:44.973
I HAD A FEELING

01:30:45.007 --> 01:30:46.842
IT WAS GOING
TO RAIN TODAY.

01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:49.678
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE
MY JOB, ARE YOU?

01:30:49.712 --> 01:30:51.847
NO, I'M GOING
TO BE A CAMERAMAN

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.017
FOR MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:56.919
IS THAT OK?

01:30:59.254 --> 01:31:02.190
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.530
Man: THERE ARE A GREAT MANY
OF ROBERT'S FRIENDS HERE,

01:31:07.563 --> 01:31:09.632
EVEN IN WINTER.

01:31:09.665 --> 01:31:12.968
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
ROBERT WAS UNUSUAL.

01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:15.971
I THINK THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT
SO MANY OF YOU OUT.

01:31:16.004 --> 01:31:20.208
A LOVING HUSBAND AND FATHER
FOR 40 YEARS,

01:31:20.242 --> 01:31:24.847
AND A GOOD FRIEND
TO SOME OF YOU FOR LONGER.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.849
I'M SURE THAT'S WHY

01:31:26.882 --> 01:31:29.952
WE APPRECIATED
AND LOVED ROBERT.

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:37.259
HE WAS EXCELLENT,
SELFLESS, RESOLUTE.

01:31:37.292 --> 01:31:38.961
Dave: I REMEMBER ONCE

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:42.831
IMAGINING WHAT
MY LIFE WOULD BE LIKE,

01:31:42.865 --> 01:31:44.900
WHAT I'D BE LIKE.

01:31:44.933 --> 01:31:47.803
I PICTURED HAVING
ALL THESE QUALITIES,

01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:51.006
STRONG, POSITIVE QUALITIES,

01:31:51.039 --> 01:31:54.910
THAT PEOPLE COULD PICK UP ON
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

01:31:57.312 --> 01:31:58.881
BUT AS TIME PASSED,

01:31:58.914 --> 01:32:02.918
FEW EVER BECAME ANY QUALITIES
I ACTUALLY HAD.

01:32:04.052 --> 01:32:06.655
AND ALL THE POSSIBILITIES
I FACED

01:32:06.689 --> 01:32:08.757
AND THE SORTS OF PEOPLE
I COULD BE,

01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:11.326
ALL OF THEM GOT REDUCED
EVERY YEAR

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:13.028
TO FEWER AND FEWER

01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:16.765
UNTIL FINALLY
THEY GOT REDUCED TO ONE,

01:32:16.799 --> 01:32:19.868
TO WHO I AM.

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:28.276
AND THAT'S WHO I AM.

01:32:30.946 --> 01:32:33.548
THE WEATHER MAN.

01:33:25.233 --> 01:33:26.869
BUT FIRST DAVE SPRITZ
HAS A CHECK

01:33:26.902 --> 01:33:28.270

DAVE?

01:33:28.303 --> 01:33:29.271
WELL, THANKS, BRYANT.

01:33:29.304 --> 01:33:31.874
IT FEELS LIKE SPRING
IF YOU'RE IN THE NORTHEAST.

01:33:31.907 --> 01:33:33.175
IS IT GOING TO LAST?
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

01:33:33.208 --> 01:33:35.711
WE'VE GOT
A WARM WEATHER SYSTEM--

01:33:35.744 --> 01:33:37.312
MIKE,
YOU READY FOR SCHOOL?

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:39.314
RUSS?

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:41.283
LET'S GO, GUYS.

01:33:41.316 --> 01:33:43.318
COME ON.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.254
YOU'RE GOING
TO GET IT.

01:33:46.288 --> 01:33:47.856
BYE, SHELLY.

01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:48.891
BYE, MOM.

01:33:48.924 --> 01:33:50.125
THAT'S YOUR
NATIONAL WEATHER,

01:33:50.158 --> 01:33:51.660
I'LL BE BACK
WITH YOUR LOCAL FOCUS

01:33:51.694 --> 01:33:54.029
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUR.

01:34:12.815 --> 01:34:15.283
HEY, YOU DAVE SPRITZ?

01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:15.918
YEAH.

01:34:15.951 --> 01:34:17.385
CAN I GET
YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

01:34:17.419 --> 01:34:18.921
SURE.

01:34:23.225 --> 01:34:26.762
SO, IS IT GOING
TO RAIN TODAY?

01:34:26.795 --> 01:34:28.931
WHO KNOWS?

01:34:33.035 --> 01:34:35.170
HEY, HELLO AMERICA.

01:34:35.971 --> 01:34:36.939
Dave: I'VE BEEN
DOING THE SHOW

01:34:36.972 --> 01:34:38.040
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

01:34:38.073 --> 01:34:41.309
PEOPLE DON'T THROW THINGS
AT ME ANYMORE.

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:43.779
MAYBE BECAUSE I CARRY
A BOW AROUND.

01:34:43.812 --> 01:34:46.882
I DON'T KNOW.

01:34:46.915 --> 01:34:48.383
(BAND PLAYING)

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.889
I GO BACK
TO CHICAGO WEEKENDS,

01:34:53.922 --> 01:34:55.824
KEEP IT STEADY
WITH MIKE AND SHELLY,

01:34:55.858 --> 01:34:57.492
COME BACK
AND DO THE WEATHER.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:01.730
SO, FORECAST? COME ON.

01:35:01.764 --> 01:35:04.266
ANOTHER MAN'S
WITH MY FAMILY.

01:35:04.299 --> 01:35:07.770
THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT
THE WAY I PREDICTED.

01:35:07.803 --> 01:35:10.939
ACCEPTING THAT'S NOT EASY.

01:35:10.973 --> 01:35:14.076
BUT EASY DOESN'T ENTER
INTO GROWN-UP LIFE.

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:19.081
I'LL TAKE THIS
AMERICAN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

01:35:19.114 --> 01:35:21.483
THAT'S WHERE I LIVE--

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:23.986
BEHIND FIRE BRIGADE 47.

01:35:24.019 --> 01:35:28.123
OK...BUT IN FRONT
OF SPONGE BOB.

01:35:29.825 --> 01:35:31.393
HELLO, AMERICA.
