00:00.218 --> 00:01.882
Previously on "Music City"

00:01.984 --> 00:05.176
Alexandra Harper, you are
the new Miss Tennessee!

00:05.272 --> 00:06.971
I cannot believe she won.

00:07.074 --> 00:09.141
She's going to have a
party, if you'd like to come.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.976
Kerry and I are separated.

00:11.078 --> 00:13.312
And I hooked up with this other guy.

00:13.414 --> 00:13.879
Oh, my gosh.

00:13.981 --> 00:14.913
He texted you?

00:15.016 --> 00:16.015
Are you going to tell Kerry?

00:16.117 --> 00:17.282
I don't know.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.018
Your marriage is stronger than some guy.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.419
I don't know that.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.357
This is, like, my friend,
so yeah, absolutely, I'm

00:25.459 --> 00:26.025
going to set them up.

00:26.127 --> 00:26.892
How are you doing?

00:26.994 --> 00:27.593
Jackson Boyd.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.994
I'm Savana.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.496
Why is this girl talking
to Jackson so heavy?

00:30.598 --> 00:31.430
I think it's time.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.332
He doesn't get a goodbye.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.001
Oh, one more good one.e.

00:36.103 --> 00:36.835
One more good one.

00:36.937 --> 00:37.603
Oh, my...

00:37.705 --> 00:38.237
There you go.

00:38.339 --> 00:38.837
Come on.

00:38.939 --> 00:39.638
No shortcuts here.

00:39.740 --> 00:40.406
OK.

00:40.508 --> 00:40.806
There you go.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.341
On back.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.108
Hoo.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.343
Miss USA, here we come.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.644
Do you feel all right from last night?

00:45.746 --> 00:46.678
Yeah, I do.

00:46.781 --> 00:47.713
I guess you didn't drink.

00:47.815 --> 00:48.680
But you, on the other hand...

00:48.783 --> 00:49.815
I know, right?

00:49.917 --> 00:50.949
Feeling good.

00:51.052 --> 00:51.984
So did you talk to Jessica much?

00:52.086 --> 00:52.885
Uh, no, I don't...

00:52.987 --> 00:54.053
Did they say bye?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.387
I didn't get... even see them leave.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.989
I didn't either.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.590
I think that's a whole Jessica thing

00:58.692 --> 00:59.858
and it's not going to happen.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.393
Why do you say that?

01:01.495 --> 01:02.861
You know, I just sort of
felt like she was a little off.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.296
And I just think that you and Savana

01:04.397 --> 01:05.697
are a lot more compatible.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.466
She's one of those girls
that does not play games.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.202
And I can see you guys,
like, hitting it off just

01:10.304 --> 01:11.770
like you did last night.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.005
Um.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.673
I mean, I think it's a great option.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.984
Three, two, one, let's knock it out.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.754
Excellent job, y'all.

01:28.856 --> 01:29.922
Keep it up for me.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.157
We got 30 seconds.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.163
20 seconds.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.334
A little quicker here.

01:47.007 --> 01:47.873
Pulse it out.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.141
Get those pushups moving.

01:53.848 --> 01:54.713
Now we're talking.

01:54.815 --> 01:55.347
Woo!

01:55.449 --> 01:55.714
Ey!

01:59.587 --> 02:00.385
Thank y'all very much.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.086
Appreciate it.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.387
I'll let you know.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.622
Yeah, you can give me the details later.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.490
Good luck.

02:07.695 --> 02:08.393
Hey.

02:08.496 --> 02:08.926
Hey.

02:09.029 --> 02:09.595
How are you?

02:09.697 --> 02:10.529
I'm OK.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.497
I need to talk to you.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.198
What's up?

02:13.300 --> 02:16.201
I feel like you were kind of
a jerk at the pageant party.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.736
I mean, how so?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.171
OK.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.441
You invite J Mack to meet,
like, your whole family.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.443
We showed up, and then
it was like you were just

02:24.545 --> 02:26.545
talking to this other
girl like the whole time.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.479
It just sucked.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.780
Like, were you trying to hurt her?

02:28.883 --> 02:30.415
Absolutely not.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.451
I mean, that's not my nature to
just, you know, hurt someone.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.319
I mean, maybe it wasn't
the best look for me

02:34.421 --> 02:36.788
to talk to Savana that long of a time.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.323
But, like, she didn't even say bye.

02:38.425 --> 02:41.560
Yeah, I think she was pretty pissed.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.663
I just feel like you need
to figure out what you want.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.899
If it's not in your heart,
it's not in your heart.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.767
If it's not there, that's fine, Jackson,

02:48.869 --> 02:50.936
but you need to let her know.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.804
OK.

02:52.907 --> 02:53.739
Soon.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.541
I know.

02:56.877 --> 03:00.779
These are the
things that will carry away.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:12.493 --> 03:15.827
So I haven't seen you since
all these pageant celebrations.

03:15.930 --> 03:16.995
I had fun.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.263
Like, I had fun with the two of us.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.599
I felt weird for Jess, because Jackson

03:20.701 --> 03:23.335
was talking to that pageant
girl the whole night.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.169
Savana?

03:24.271 --> 03:24.803
She's cool.

03:24.905 --> 03:25.737
No.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.738
No.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.739
You know pageant girls.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.107
They go after what they want.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.209
Ugh.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.710
It's so hard to date in Nashville.

03:33.180 --> 03:33.679
No!

03:33.781 --> 03:34.580
No?

03:34.682 --> 03:36.281
What do you mean no?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.389
I don't want to date
people that I meet in a bar.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.294
I'm pretty sure
they're all in love, too.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.462
Everyone except Bryant.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.997
We're actually co-writing tomorrow.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.599
Oh, my god.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.604
It's like, I don't know that guy.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.906
That's just, like, a hot drummer.

04:01.008 --> 04:01.840
Thank you, everybody.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.342
We are Jet Black Alley Cat.

04:10.818 --> 04:14.086
OK, so don't hate me, but I actually

04:14.188 --> 04:15.821
went to Jackson's class today.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.925
And after the class, I
went up and talked to him.

04:20.027 --> 04:20.826
You talked to him?

04:20.928 --> 04:21.459
Yeah.

04:21.562 --> 04:21.892
About?

04:21.995 --> 04:23.095
Yeah.

04:23.197 --> 04:26.965
Oh, my gosh, Rach, what did you say?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.700
I told him he needs to talk to you

04:28.802 --> 04:31.870
and just figure out what he
wants, and stop messing around.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.438
Ah.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.773
No, I don't... I mean, I know
you were looking out for me.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.375
I appreciate that.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.076
I just have no idea what I even
want to say to him right now.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.111
You know?

04:39.213 --> 04:41.380
That night was such a mess.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.749
Can we talk about
that, though, the text?

04:43.851 --> 04:44.483
Yeah.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.183
I mean...

04:45.286 --> 04:45.851
Have you talked to him?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.019
No.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.553
Why are you so scared to tell him?

04:48.656 --> 04:51.490
It's hard to explain, but
like, when Kerry and I were

04:51.592 --> 04:55.327
separated and I hooked
up with J and everything,

04:55.429 --> 04:58.697
we were in such a bad
place for our marriage.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.533
I know that I hurt Kerry so much.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.502
And so I don't want to do anything

05:03.604 --> 05:08.840
that would, like, take us back
to that place that we were in.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.108
You're a good wife.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.843
You're a good mom.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.412
You haven't done anything wrong.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.281
I just think the truth is
going to take this big weight

05:16.383 --> 05:17.916
off your shoulders.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.252
I think y'all are strong
enough to handle this.

05:28.262 --> 05:29.895
I have a few ideas.

05:29.997 --> 05:30.929
Just lyrics, though.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.497
Do you mind if I read them through here?

05:32.599 --> 05:34.733
Yeah, go ahead.

05:34.835 --> 05:35.734
OK.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.702
So...

05:36.804 --> 05:37.903
These are just thoughts in my head.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.504
What are you thinking chorus-wise?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.206
Maybe the "dear love..."
yeah, that would be...

05:41.308 --> 05:42.474
Yeah, I kind of think so too.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.976
Yeah, do you have
any music melody ideas?

05:45.079 --> 05:47.079
Well, do you want this
to be like a power ballad,

05:47.181 --> 05:52.017
like "dear love," or do you
want it to be like "dear love?"

05:52.820 --> 05:54.052
I love power ballads.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.987
I think power ballads are good.

05:56.090 --> 05:59.591
So F up to A minor.

06:02.996 --> 06:03.895
D minor.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.901
B Sus2.

06:10.003 --> 06:10.302
OK.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.503
So I...

06:11.605 --> 06:12.904
And I think that's a cool chorus.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.106
So...

06:14.208 --> 06:15.941
And now I just have to
figure out how to sing this.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.876
Well, honestly, the easiest
thing for me is to kind of dig

06:17.978 --> 06:20.312
into something I've already felt before.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.481
Maybe I can get there, but right now I'm

06:22.583 --> 06:23.982
kind of just like...

06:24.084 --> 06:26.418
Wouldn't... if you don't mind me asking,

06:26.520 --> 06:28.787
is this song about an ex?

06:28.889 --> 06:29.488
Mm-hm.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.455
Yeah?

06:30.557 --> 06:33.291
Were you in love with him?

06:33.394 --> 06:35.727
It's just, like, I don't know.

06:35.829 --> 06:39.131
It was... it was a really hard time.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.833
I didn't want to fall in
love with him and I did.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.904
And I just felt constantly
like I wasn't good enough,

06:46.006 --> 06:52.978
but I just stuck around because
I was like, maybe one day I'll

06:53.080 --> 06:54.746
be good enough.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.448
And then it turned out he found somebody

06:56.550 --> 06:57.783
else who was good enough.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.088
But they had a baby.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.092
And he wasn't coming back.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.226
Mm-hm.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.361
But for me, that's, like, what I

07:09.463 --> 07:11.029
needed, because it wasn't healthy

07:11.131 --> 07:12.898
and I didn't need to
be involved with him.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.035
But that was the only way
I was able to get out.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.737
This was last year and...

07:18.839 --> 07:20.305
and here I am still, like...

07:20.407 --> 07:21.873
Still feeling the weight of it.

07:21.975 --> 07:22.340
Yeah.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.642
Yeah.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.778
But if I can use my
heartbreak to maybe help

07:26.880 --> 07:30.148
somebody else from theirs,
then that's what I want to do.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.616
So let's pull that.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.884
Let's figure it out.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.419
All right. You want to try the
whole thing?

07:34.521 --> 07:35.187
Yeah.

07:35.289 --> 07:35.821
Here we go.

07:35.923 --> 07:36.888
OK.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.491
The lies I've told myself...

07:39.593 --> 07:45.964
that it'll be OK, I created a fairy tale

07:46.066 --> 07:49.334
and lost the strength to walk away.

07:49.436 --> 07:56.007
I thought this letter would
help, mend our brokenness.

07:56.109 --> 08:02.481
I finally figured out we're
so much better than this.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.451
Dear love, I trusted you!

08:06.553 --> 08:09.888
And you let me down.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.858
You told me to open my heart.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.228
But I jumped and fell to the ground.

08:16.330 --> 08:22.801
I'm gathering up the pieces
and starting to move on.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.438
I was terrified for a while.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.040
Oh, how you made me strong.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.616
Are we playing a track?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.451
I would like to sing to a track.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.354
If I can, that'd be just great.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.890
Go for it.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.592
Hey, Jared, could you give us a minute?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.194
You can come in.

08:52.232 --> 08:52.564
Hi.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.398
Hey.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.299
What's going on?

08:54.401 --> 08:55.333
This is a surprise.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.401
I figured you'd be in here.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.469
I've been, you know...

08:57.571 --> 08:58.670
I hope I'm not bothering you.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.338
No, I can take a little break.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.172
You sure?

09:01.275 --> 09:01.740
Yeah, you wanna...

09:01.842 --> 09:02.340
How are you?

09:02.442 --> 09:03.074
Good.

09:03.176 --> 09:03.742
How are you?

09:03.844 --> 09:04.643
Good to see you.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.510
What's up with you?

09:05.612 --> 09:06.778
Nothing.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.913
I was just... hadn't talked
to you in a little while.

09:08.015 --> 09:08.647
I know.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.814
I've been really busy.

09:09.917 --> 09:10.782
And...

09:10.884 --> 09:12.250
Is something else on your mind?

09:12.352 --> 09:13.285
I mean, kind of.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.586
I was just kind of confused.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.087
I just haven't heard anything, you know?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.122
I know.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.124
I'm not awesome at confrontation, so.

09:19.226 --> 09:23.094
I don't know, I felt a little bit...

09:23.196 --> 09:25.730
I mean, to be frank,
a little disrespected.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.600
You mean when I was talking to Savana?

09:28.702 --> 09:29.868
Yeah.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.202
I mean, I didn't want you to babysit me,

09:31.305 --> 09:32.537
because I don't think...

09:32.639 --> 09:33.838
I didn't need that.

09:33.941 --> 09:37.309
It was just like a 30-,
45-minute conversation.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.877
I was just kind of forgotten.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.845
Is that why you all kind of,
like, left in, like, a hurry

09:40.948 --> 09:42.480
and didn't really say anything?

09:42.583 --> 09:46.151
I mean, we were wondering if
you noticed that we had left.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.218
I apologize.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.453
That's not ever my
intention to hurt you.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.088
And I feel like I've done that.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.357
It makes me feel terrible,
because the thought of you

09:52.459 --> 09:55.060
being by yourself at that
party is not what I wanted.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.494
I know.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.296
I just kind of got caught up
in the moment, and, you know...

09:58.398 --> 10:00.765
I guess maybe those are the kind
of things I need to work on.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.334
I don't think you're a bad guy.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.969
I think you're awesome.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.505
But I just want a guy that
is proud to be with me

10:07.608 --> 10:11.009
and he's not going to make me
feel second-best in the room.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.078
That's why I'm still single.

10:13.180 --> 10:17.048
I'm waiting for a guy
to make me feel special.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.783
There's always been that big question

10:18.885 --> 10:20.652
mark in the back of my head of, is he

10:20.754 --> 10:23.254
ready for what I'm looking for?

10:23.357 --> 10:28.493
Obviously, that night at the
party was just a red flag.

10:28.595 --> 10:33.098
It was confirming what I was scared of.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.733
So many times in my life, I've felt

10:34.835 --> 10:36.167
like I've been in the right situation,

10:36.269 --> 10:40.171
but I'm just still growing as a man.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.943
I really do think
you're the perfect girl.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.912
Speak softly to me.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.581
To be honest, I'm just terrified

10:49.683 --> 10:51.716
because I don't know
if I'm ready for that

10:51.818 --> 10:52.984
at this point in my life.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.890
I just don't know if
I have the time to wait.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.362
Time wasted to disagree.

11:10.037 --> 11:13.805
I want to tell you everything.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.180
Hey.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.215
Hey.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.216
What are you doing here?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.084
I brought you a snack.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.520
Well, thank you so much.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.388
Appreciate it.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.690
How's work?

11:31.792 --> 11:32.991
It's good.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.628
Can we talk in the truck for a sec?

11:36.730 --> 11:37.495
Sure.

11:37.597 --> 11:38.096
OK.

11:52.446 --> 11:54.279
OK.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.180
You're pregnant.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.981
No.

11:57.084 --> 11:57.415
OK.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.388
I kind of messed up.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.756
OK.

12:04.858 --> 12:08.927
And I was thinking about
just not telling you,

12:09.029 --> 12:14.799
but I feel like it's better to tell you.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.635
OK.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.538
Remember when we were separated,

12:20.640 --> 12:21.973
I was hanging out with that guy?

12:30.217 --> 12:31.916
Four days ago, he texted me.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.922
And he just said, are
you still in Nashville?

12:38.024 --> 12:41.793
And I was like, yeah, what's up?

12:41.895 --> 12:44.662
And then he's, like,
nothing, I just moved back.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.798
Do you want to meet up?

12:46.900 --> 12:48.399
Okay.

12:48.502 --> 12:52.070
And I'm sorry I didn't tell
you right when I got that text.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.240
And I should have told you a while ago.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.007
Wait.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.609
So you didn't do anything.

12:57.711 --> 13:00.512
You just got a text from a dude
that you hooked up with once?

13:00.614 --> 13:01.880
There's no, like, meeting up?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.748
You didn't call him?

13:03.850 --> 13:07.318
I felt bad for even responding to him.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.823
Mm.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.024
Gotcha.

13:13.126 --> 13:13.992
OK.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.026
No harm done.

13:17.731 --> 13:18.530
You're not mad?

13:18.632 --> 13:19.898
No, I'm not mad.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.667
I mean, of course, you
hook up with a guy,

13:22.769 --> 13:25.570
he's going to be interested
in talking to you more.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.672
That's what happened to me.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.810
Chased you till you married me finally.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.678
So we're good.

13:33.780 --> 13:34.646
Thank you.

13:34.748 --> 13:35.346
Yup.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.314
I'm sorry.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.085
OK.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.421
I better get back to work then.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.022
OK.

13:52.666 --> 13:57.769
I wanna be a better
man, but it's a hard life.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.038
What's, uh, what's the
latest with you and Rachyl?

14:00.140 --> 14:03.007
Well, she had a big, what I thought

14:03.109 --> 14:07.278
was going to be a life changer,
but actually was like...

14:07.380 --> 14:09.180
she showed up at work the other day

14:09.282 --> 14:11.916
and had, like, a sack lunch.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.551
I should have known something was off.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.553
And she says, can we sit
in your truck and talk?

14:15.655 --> 14:19.357
In the first year of our
marriage, we split up

14:19.459 --> 14:22.393
and she went off and was
dating some other guy.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.697
And I guess that guy had
started reaching out to her

14:25.799 --> 14:26.631
again recently.

14:26.733 --> 14:27.565
Oh, snap.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.800
Yeah.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.368
Does he know, like, she's
married and has a kid?

14:30.470 --> 14:31.803
Well, she was married then.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.705
It was still inappropriate.

14:33.807 --> 14:34.672
But he wouldn't know.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.007
I don't.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.010
With, like, social media, he
could see what she's up to.

14:39.112 --> 14:39.978
Yeah.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.246
Like, he's got to know.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.413
It's still going in the back of my head

14:42.515 --> 14:44.082
that this guy's, like, still lingering

14:44.184 --> 14:45.483
around in our... in our lives.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.552
It's such a small town, though.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.920
It's...

14:49.022 --> 14:51.022
Yeah, you're not wrong about that.

14:51.124 --> 14:51.656
My turn?

14:51.758 --> 14:52.156
Yup.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.424
All right.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.795
Dude, so what are you going to do

14:57.898 --> 15:01.366
if he keeps contacting Rachyl?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.701
Well, then... then we've got problems.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.682
What do they say?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.584
It's a drinking city
with a music problem?

15:19.686 --> 15:20.318
Yes.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.686
I'm so sorry I'm late.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.086
Hi!

15:22.188 --> 15:22.887
Hi.

15:22.989 --> 15:23.888
How are ya?

15:23.990 --> 15:24.722
We already got our drinks.

15:24.824 --> 15:25.490
We couldn't wait.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.157
Oh, get her a mocktail!

15:27.794 --> 15:29.193
Just, like, been a day.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.962
So what's happening?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.163
Jackson, actually.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.868
Like, we just decided to not be dating.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.202
So...

15:38.305 --> 15:39.737
Mutually or...

15:39.839 --> 15:43.408
Obviously, that pageant party
was a pretty telltale sign.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.177
I was probably dumb
for, like, thinking it

15:46.279 --> 15:47.979
could be more than what it was.

15:48.081 --> 15:52.784
But I'm, you know, 30 and I'm ready.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.218
I'm so ready, y'all.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.857
Yeah.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.795
You always have us to come and cry with.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.029
We got your back.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.331
Oh, y'all change the subject.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.832
What's going on with you guys?

16:07.934 --> 16:13.871
I had a very therapeutic
writing session with Bryant,

16:13.974 --> 16:15.907
and there were tears involved.

16:16.009 --> 16:16.774
Why?

16:16.876 --> 16:18.076
Why were you crying?

16:18.178 --> 16:20.778
I was writing about my ex,
but I kind of cried it out

16:20.880 --> 16:22.113
and I'm like, that's done.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.815
Chapter closed.

16:23.917 --> 16:29.187
I'm ready to move forward
with my relationships.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.989
Stop looking at her like that.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.127
I mean, are you sure
you don't like Bryant?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.629
I feel like we're close,
because we spend a lot of time

16:38.732 --> 16:39.998
together writing and stuff.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.366
I feel like the best relationships

16:41.468 --> 16:44.035
stem from good friendships.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.303
It's true.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.839
I'm just trying to write some music, OK?

16:47.941 --> 16:48.906
Yeah.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.641
Well, I did something really good today.

16:50.744 --> 16:51.275
Yeah?

16:51.378 --> 16:52.810
What did you do?

16:52.912 --> 16:56.280
I finally told Kerry about
the text messages from J.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.015
OK.

16:57.117 --> 16:57.915
How'd it go?

16:58.018 --> 16:58.816
What is the verdict?

16:58.918 --> 16:59.751
He took it really well.

16:59.853 --> 17:00.485
That's so good.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.486
I'm proud of you.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.053
Yay.

17:02.155 --> 17:02.920
Good job.

17:03.023 --> 17:03.554
Do you feel better?

17:03.656 --> 17:04.355
Yeah.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.223
I just want to move forward.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.023
Yeah.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.290
Look at us.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.992
All of us are, like,
closing the chapter on...

17:09.095 --> 17:09.761
We are.

17:09.863 --> 17:10.228
stupid boys.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.262
Cheers.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.064
Today was a day of new starts.

17:14.000 --> 17:14.298
New starts!

17:14.401 --> 17:15.032
Yeah!

17:15.135 --> 17:15.867
I like it.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.035
Yeah!

17:17.137 --> 17:18.301
And don't feel like you
can't keep, you know...

17:18.405 --> 17:19.137
Matchmaking?

17:19.239 --> 17:20.405
Yeah.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.606
It's my fault for hooking you guys up.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.307
I do feel bad.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.175
No.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.009
He was a good...

17:25.111 --> 17:25.977
he's a good guy.

17:26.079 --> 17:26.911
He doesn't deserve you.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.413
Yeah.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.082
I mean, I think pageant girl
is kind of more his speed.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.316
Kind of seems that way.

17:37.223 --> 17:41.025
Baby, I'm the real thing.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.160
What is up, pretty girl?

17:42.262 --> 17:42.927
Why, hello.

17:43.029 --> 17:43.861
How are you?

17:43.963 --> 17:44.729
You look amazing.

17:44.831 --> 17:45.263
Good.

17:45.365 --> 17:45.930
How are you?

17:46.032 --> 17:47.198
Thank you.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.199
You wanna sit?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.835
Yes.

17:50.937 --> 17:51.335
Here, my dear.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.103
Thank you.

17:52.205 --> 17:52.837
Cheers.

17:52.939 --> 17:53.404
Oh, yeah.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.038
Absolutely.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.006
Cheers.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.574
So glad we're doing this.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.309
What did you think about the
pageant party the other night?

17:58.411 --> 17:59.043
Yeah?

17:59.145 --> 18:00.578
I liked it.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.479
I didn't, like, plan on
sitting there talking to you.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.380
It just, like, happened.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.648
I was like, you.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.751
Come here.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.686
So speaking of the, like, pageant...

18:08.788 --> 18:09.887
What?

18:09.989 --> 18:12.090
You walked across the
stage, and I was like, damn.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.793
Not trying to get, like, personal,

18:15.895 --> 18:19.197
but what's your
relationship past and stuff?

18:19.299 --> 18:24.335
The last relationship I
was in, we broke up in June.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.438
When was your last relationship?

18:27.540 --> 18:30.074
I was talking to a
girl kind of recently.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.409
Uh-huh.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.778
And I guess the timing
was off a little bit.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.880
Was it?

18:35.982 --> 18:37.715
I'm just kind of like
live out of the seat

18:37.817 --> 18:39.417
of my pants a little bit and, like, wear

18:39.519 --> 18:40.918
my emotions on my sleeve.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.287
So it's like someone who's
not afraid to be forward.

18:43.389 --> 18:43.921
Yeah.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.022
Kind of.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.390
If I like you, I'm going
to tell you I like you.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.392
Like, I hate playing games.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.227
She...

18:49.329 --> 18:50.661
Do you like me?

18:50.763 --> 18:52.864
I mean, I
wouldn't be here right now if I

18:52.966 --> 18:54.098
didn't like you.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.968
Sneak up on you like a deadline.

18:57.070 --> 19:00.371
Leave you standing all alone
on the sideline out of time.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.340
Do you want to make a move?

19:02.442 --> 19:05.676
Just a goodbye.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.613
Hiding right there in plain sight,

19:08.715 --> 19:10.848
all the damage done before you realize.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.919
How can a love just give up over night?

19:18.158 --> 19:23.327
Shouting through a crowded room
or whispering alone with you.

19:23.429 --> 19:27.365
All the bombs drop the same
way, with a "wish you could,

19:27.467 --> 19:30.635
but you can't stay."

19:30.737 --> 19:36.641
They never tell you
how the game is played.

19:36.743 --> 19:42.547
And the million different
ways, a heart can break.

19:42.649 --> 19:48.486
Never seem to know till it's too late

19:48.588 --> 19:51.989
the million different
ways a heart can break.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.562
Sorry I won't do that.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.796
And that's all you got?

20:01.734 --> 20:07.605
♪ They never tell you
how the game is played ♪

20:07.707 --> 20:13.611
♪ and the million different
ways a heart can break. ♪

20:13.713 --> 20:20.418
♪ Never seem to know till
it's too late or the million ♪

20:20.520 --> 20:25.156
♪ different ways a heart can break. ♪

20:30.263 --> 20:31.662
- So Jackson's playing
- Ne at the Basement.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.097
Have you heard Jackson perform before?

20:33.199 --> 20:34.065
No.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.099
How do I raise this up?

20:37.770 --> 20:39.270
I didn't know you
were going to be there.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.239
If you were to cross
paths with Jessica again,

20:41.341 --> 20:43.140
it would be like playing
with fire right now.

20:43.243 --> 20:46.644
I nominated you as Most Eligible Single.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.146
I'm going to meet with this
writer named Brooke Eden.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.848
Is Rachyl cool with
you writing together?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.984
As long as we don't meet
after the sun goes down

20:53.086 --> 20:53.884
with a bottle of wine.

20:53.987 --> 20:54.619
Let's go.

20:56.723 --> 20:57.588
Check, please.
