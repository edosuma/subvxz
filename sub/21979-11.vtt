I don't want to be a pig!
The ladies don't love pigs!

Can't you turn me
into something cool?

00:30.329 --> 00:31.295

03:06.452 --> 03:10.287
All right, I got things to do
and bad guys to mess up.

03:10.289 --> 03:11.455
Karai's still out there.

03:11.457 --> 03:14.491
The last thing she said to me
was the word "comet."

03:14.493 --> 03:16.560
(Casey)
So, what's that
supposed to mean?

03:16.562 --> 03:20.030
A giant comet's coming?
The earth's doomed?

03:20.032 --> 03:22.266
It feels like it could
be a location.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.500
Maybe where
she's hiding out.

03:23.502 --> 03:26.704
Donnie's found three locations
with the word "comet" in them.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.139
- D?
- We've got Comet Cleaners

03:29.141 --> 03:30.407
on Bleecker Street here.

03:30.409 --> 03:33.177
<i>Earth vs. the Comet Creeps</i>
is playing

03:33.179 --> 03:34.211
at the Argosy Theater here.

03:34.213 --> 03:37.247
And then we've got
the Coney Comet roller coaster

03:37.249 --> 03:38.115
on Coney Island here.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.818
So one of these places
could be her lair...

03:40.820 --> 03:41.652
theoretically.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.154
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Can I check out
the Comet roller coaster?

03:44.156 --> 03:48.092
Please? Come on, Leo,
hook a turtle up.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.761
Donnie and April,
you take Comet Cleaners.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.197
Raph and Casey,
you take the movie theater.

03:53.199 --> 03:57.067
Me and Mikey will check out
Coney Island.

03:57.069 --> 03:59.336
Oh, yeah, boy!

03:59.338 --> 04:00.771
Thanks, Leo.

04:00.773 --> 04:04.742
I have just enough retro-mutagen
brewed for three doses.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.776
Each team gets one.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.145
It'll be weeks
before I finish more.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.214
So in other words,
don't waste it. Got you.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.849
Karai's condition
is unique.

04:11.851 --> 04:14.418
There's no guarantee
this will even work on her.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.286
All we can do is try,
Donnie.

Listen, Comrade Zeck,

04:39.779 --> 04:41.278
forget Karai.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.648
We must destroy
turtles instead

04:44.650 --> 04:46.517
for what they did to me.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.519
I mean, us.

04:48.521 --> 04:49.419
You're right, big S.

04:49.421 --> 04:51.421
If they hadn't interfered
at the docks,

04:51.423 --> 04:52.489
none of this
would have happened.

04:52.491 --> 04:55.726
I say we comb those turtles'
wigs back,

04:55.728 --> 04:58.862
flip it and comb the wig
back again!

04:58.864 --> 05:00.264
I say we splits up,

05:00.266 --> 05:04.201
track them down and
sqwoosh them where they stands.

No sign of Karai.

abandoned.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.242
He was a thief named Zeck.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.911
Looks like he got
a little mutated.

catch a turtle,

I know exactly where
the other freaks are going.

07:03.522 --> 07:05.355
Check out the Argosy Theater
on Houston.

are going to Coney Island.

can be communicated with.

call Donnie.

It's not your specs,
dude.

07:37.489 --> 07:39.022
We searched every inch
of the place.

07:39.024 --> 07:40.524
Karai's definitely
not here.

Why doesn't she just
come out?

09:38.676 --> 09:40.544
Maybe she's not
in her right mind.

she'll lose control
