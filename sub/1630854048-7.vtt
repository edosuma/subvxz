WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.047
[squeegee squeaking on window]

00:08.834 --> 00:10.880
[squeaking continues]

00:15.580 --> 00:16.668
MARISSA:
Diane?

00:16.712 --> 00:19.976
Want to use the conference room?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.674
Diane, would you want to use
the conference room instead?

00:22.718 --> 00:23.980
No, I'm fine.

00:25.503 --> 00:26.591
Did you hear what happened?

00:26.635 --> 00:28.724
What?

00:28.767 --> 00:31.031
It wasn't suicide. The guy
was trying to hang a banner

00:31.074 --> 00:32.075
on the roof.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.772
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.644
"Fight the Hate."

00:35.687 --> 00:38.864
I guess he slipped and killed
two protesters on the street.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.128
That is... horrifying.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.868
It might get ugly today.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.219
The rumor is, he intentionally
jumped from our office

00:45.262 --> 00:48.091
-to kill two Proud Boys.
-Oh, geez, I give up.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.179
Diane, um,

00:49.223 --> 00:50.441
I'm ready.

00:50.485 --> 00:51.790
Oh.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.532
Good. How awful.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.186
Did you hear
it was somebody who slipped?

00:56.230 --> 00:58.580
And people think
he jumped from here.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.886
[sighs]:
God, that's crazy.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.106
All right, I'm-I'm headed out.
Do you want a ride?

01:03.150 --> 01:06.762
No, I'll catch up with you.
I have to gather my files.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.767
Whoa!

01:11.810 --> 01:13.856
[both laughing]

01:13.899 --> 01:15.162
God.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.947
CANDACE:
Was this found in the dorms?

01:17.990 --> 01:19.296
AVERY:
Yes, in the study room.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.038
CANDACE:
And this, where was this found?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.909
It was thrown through
one of the classroom windows.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.302
-That must have been terrifying.
-AVERY: It was.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.130
Everybody dove
under their desks.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.349
And what did
the school president do?

01:28.392 --> 01:30.351
AVERY:
She said, "Don't worry,

01:30.394 --> 01:32.657
the administration had
everything under control."

01:32.701 --> 01:34.398
CANDACE:
But there were five
other bomb threats

01:34.442 --> 01:36.139
-after that, weren't there?
-Yeah.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.793
That's when my parents said,
"You got to come home.

01:37.836 --> 01:39.142
-It's not safe anymore."
-And did you?

01:39.186 --> 01:41.840
Yes, but the school
wouldn't refund

01:41.884 --> 01:44.669
my tu-- our tuition.

01:44.713 --> 01:47.150
And that's why you're all here
in arbitration?

01:47.194 --> 01:49.718
-You and 58 other students?
-Yes.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.981
We want our tuition back.
We want to use the money

01:52.024 --> 01:54.636
-at a safer school...
-A whiter school.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.333
Let's not interrupt please,
Madam President.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.205
CANDACE:
No further questions.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.467
LOUIS:
Go ahead, ma'am.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.773
Uh... Mr. Jones,

02:01.817 --> 02:03.732
where did you go after you left
Wilson Clayman?

02:03.775 --> 02:04.950
What college?

02:04.994 --> 02:07.083
-Mm-hmm.
-AVERY: Notre Dame, but

02:07.127 --> 02:09.912
o-only because it-it was safer,

02:09.955 --> 02:11.696
-not because it was, uh...
-Whiter?

02:11.740 --> 02:13.916
I didn't say that.
No, I just meant "not as

02:13.959 --> 02:17.746
-alternative."
-Okay, so you were looking
for someplace safe

02:17.789 --> 02:20.009
from...

02:20.052 --> 02:21.706
this

02:21.750 --> 02:23.447
and this?

02:23.491 --> 02:25.188
AVERY:
They don't have to be real
to terrorize you.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.450
LOUIS:
What are you doing?

02:26.494 --> 02:28.539
Uh, this is
our firm's investigator.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.324
I just want him
to take a look at these.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.500
Mr. Jones, this is the
college enrollment contract...

02:32.543 --> 02:34.197
The same as the one
in our office?

02:34.241 --> 02:36.199
Well, they're terrorizing
Black institutions.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.766
Any idea who?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.507
Not yet.

02:39.550 --> 02:43.772
Now, in what way
is Wilson Clayman responsible

02:43.815 --> 02:45.339
for the current
protests happening

02:45.382 --> 02:46.818
-in Chicago?
-I can answer that.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.212
If you were witness,
I would welcome it.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.561
Mr. Cage, if Ms. Reddick
is finished,

02:50.605 --> 02:52.215
-I have an exhibit.
-Go ahead.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.478
I'm sickened to bear witness

02:54.522 --> 02:56.306
to the state of affairs
in this country.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.527
Books are being banned
and burned

02:59.570 --> 03:01.224
and hidden in the shadows

03:01.268 --> 03:03.183
to keep people ignorant,

03:03.226 --> 03:05.446
to keep people
out of their power.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.665
School districts
are fighting tooth

03:07.709 --> 03:11.234
and nail just so they don't
have to teach about race or

03:11.278 --> 03:13.280
racism or American history.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.020
It's disgusting

03:15.064 --> 03:16.587
and it's wrong.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.633
This is what I don't understand.

03:18.676 --> 03:22.071
If I said anything like that
about anti-white bias,

03:22.114 --> 03:23.812
I would be called racist.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.944
COMMENTATOR [over TV]:
She's an educator. She shouldn't

03:25.988 --> 03:28.599
be trying to start a race war.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.993
The first bomb threat came
two days after Ms. Allen-Hellman

03:31.036 --> 03:32.951
made these remarks.
If she hadn't given

03:32.995 --> 03:34.866
her little speech,
Wilson Clayman

03:34.910 --> 03:36.651
wouldn't have become a target.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.218
That's why the college
is responsible.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.742
So, you're saying
we brought this on ourselves?

03:40.785 --> 03:42.265
-Madam President...
-ANGELA: No, I will not

03:42.309 --> 03:43.832
hold my tongue

03:43.875 --> 03:47.270
and allow white supremacy
to control the narrative.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.405
These kids and their parents,

03:51.448 --> 03:54.364
they want to bankrupt my school.

03:54.408 --> 03:57.106
We can't afford
to refund tuition.

03:57.149 --> 04:00.805
That's why it might be time to
pursue your liability insurance.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.285
That means
we're admitting fault?

04:02.329 --> 04:03.939
No, it means that
you're being smart.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.116
We're not paying.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.728
That's-that's not an option,
Mr. Sandel.

04:10.772 --> 04:13.122
-You are the school's insurer.
-EDWARD: Yeah, Ridley Mutual

04:13.165 --> 04:14.863
is not recognizing your claim.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.691
DIANE:
The injury to students' academic

04:16.734 --> 04:20.564
experience was due to threats
made from unknown parties.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.087
In other words, terrorism.

04:22.131 --> 04:24.176
The school's policy
insures against that.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.004
Well, uh, "terrorism," uh,

04:26.048 --> 04:28.268
is defined as "violence or

04:28.311 --> 04:30.095
"the threat of violence absent

04:30.139 --> 04:32.402
provocation,"
so your arbitration already,

04:32.446 --> 04:35.144
uh, proved that the
terrorist acts were based on

04:35.187 --> 04:36.319
President Hellman's speech.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.453
Oh, my God, this is Kafkaesque.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.150
[crowd shouting outside]

04:42.630 --> 04:44.675
LIZ:
Uh, Mr. Sandel, uh, we

04:44.719 --> 04:47.330
contest your interpretation
of the policy's language,

04:47.374 --> 04:48.810
and we are prepared
to take legal action.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.855
See you in court.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.511
Well, this can't be good.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.426
DIANE:
Good luck.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.775
Thank you.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.565
Oh.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.654
There she is, Princess Di.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.177
-[laughs]
-Oh.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.570
-WINSTON: How's Kurt doing?
-Well, thank you.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.528
Tell him I want his dekes.

05:11.572 --> 05:12.660
-[laughs]
-Oh.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.184
[chuckles] Dekes are decoys.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.446
They-they went
duck hunting together.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.230
Oh.

05:18.274 --> 05:21.016
So, what do we need down here?
Oh, no, no,

05:21.059 --> 05:22.844
you stay, too.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.675
Well, um, we didn't expect
to see you gentlemen down here,

05:27.718 --> 05:29.154
but thank you
for taking our meeting.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.200
Uh, not to take up
too much of your time,

05:31.243 --> 05:33.333
we'd like to review a few

05:33.376 --> 05:36.248
financial issues.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.816
Yes, uh, well, despite

05:38.860 --> 05:40.688
international disruptions,

05:40.731 --> 05:42.951
uh, this past quarter
has been stronger than expected.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.387
That was noted. Well done.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.476
And being under your umbrella

05:46.520 --> 05:48.435
has been very beneficial,

05:48.478 --> 05:50.828
and we do not
take that for granted.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.526
However, uh,

05:52.569 --> 05:54.876
we have noticed
that our equity partners

05:54.919 --> 05:56.225
are two weeks behind

05:56.268 --> 05:58.358
in their pay.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.316
Have you checked
with accounting?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.317
RI'CHARD:
We have.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.275
It's not coming from them.

06:03.319 --> 06:06.409
As you might imagine, uh,
there's been a bit of grumbling.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.019
How odd.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.545
WINSTON:
To be honest with you,

06:11.588 --> 06:13.982
the Russian sanctions
over Ukraine

06:14.025 --> 06:15.418
have affected our business

06:15.462 --> 06:17.942
-more than we anticipated.
-LIZ: How so?

06:17.986 --> 06:19.857
We're not receiving payments
from some of our clients.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.990
Russian clients?

06:22.033 --> 06:24.819
It's from past work,
money owed, not new clients,

06:24.862 --> 06:26.516
but the U.S. government

06:26.560 --> 06:28.344
is still confiscating our money.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.345
RI'CHARD:
And, um,

06:29.389 --> 06:30.781
what can we do?

06:30.825 --> 06:32.217
WINSTON:
We have a date in court

06:32.261 --> 06:35.351
to argue for our funds
to be released.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.441
What would be helpful is
if you argued for us.

06:38.485 --> 06:41.618
OSMAN:
They're biased against us
for our accents

06:41.662 --> 06:43.925
and our international business.

06:43.968 --> 06:47.319
It would be good
to have local color.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.062
[stammers] We don't mean
"color" in that way.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.021
[chuckles]

06:53.064 --> 06:55.763
Oh, good thing the government
loves Black lawyers so much.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.245
I'll-I'll tell Kurt
you said hello.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.640
Diane.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.425
Are you okay?

07:05.468 --> 07:06.991
What do you mean?

07:07.035 --> 07:09.603
Well, I-I think you should take
a day or two off.

07:09.646 --> 07:12.344
You just saw a man die
right in front of you.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.869
Oh, no, no, I'm... I'm fine.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.785
I just, I need a few hours.
I'll just go walk

07:17.828 --> 07:20.309
-in the sunshine.
-Okay. Good.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.050
Good, go. Work can manage

07:22.093 --> 07:24.705
without you for a few hours,
and I'll see you in court.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.184
Okay.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.928
-[classical music playing]
-[water bubbling]

07:30.972 --> 07:32.800
[sighs]

07:32.843 --> 07:35.629
"My heart leaps up..."

07:37.457 --> 07:40.677
"...when I behold
a rainbow in the sky."

07:43.463 --> 07:46.378
"So was it when my life began."

07:47.945 --> 07:51.862
"So is it now I am...

07:51.906 --> 07:53.821
woman."

08:01.481 --> 08:03.483
[monitor beeping]

08:18.933 --> 08:20.195
How are you doing?

08:20.238 --> 08:22.937
People keep asking
if I'm all right.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.982
Are you?

08:25.026 --> 08:27.724
Well... [sighs] I saw a man

08:27.768 --> 08:30.118
d-die outside my window.

08:30.161 --> 08:33.077
-What?
-He fell from the roof
of our building

08:33.121 --> 08:36.646
-onto my balustrade.
-Oh, my God. That's awful.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.519
The world is pretty awful now,

08:39.562 --> 08:42.913
but-but then I come here,
and I...

08:42.957 --> 08:44.219
I feel good.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.092
So, is... [chuckles]
is that the secret?

08:48.136 --> 08:49.485
I just need to keep coming here?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.140
No. I mean, you can, but,

08:52.183 --> 08:54.795
eventually, the pleasure
will dissipate,

08:54.838 --> 08:56.623
and you'll suffer withdrawals.

08:56.666 --> 08:59.016
Oh, God. What then?

09:00.452 --> 09:02.063
Have you ever heard
of the "four sights"?

09:02.106 --> 09:04.282
Is that the new show
at the Art...

09:04.326 --> 09:05.980
Art Institute? Oh, no, no, no,

09:06.023 --> 09:08.025
-that's Buddha, right?
-Yes.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.679
Prince Siddhartha.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.551
He ventured outside his palace
for the first time,

09:11.594 --> 09:15.424
and he saw four sights
that changed him forever.

09:15.467 --> 09:19.080
Aging, disease, and death.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.472
-He saw a rotting corpse.
-Are you a Buddhist?

09:20.516 --> 09:22.300
-I am.
-Really?

09:22.344 --> 09:24.607
-Really.
-Wow. You don't seem like one.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.175
-I hide it very well.
-[laughs]

09:28.785 --> 09:30.918
So, what is the-the
fourth sight?

09:30.961 --> 09:34.051
You mentioned three.
What's... beyond death?

09:34.095 --> 09:36.184
He met an ascetic.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.534

24:05.922 --> 24:07.358
-That is correct.
-RI'CHARD: So...

24:07.402 --> 24:09.926
these payments
should not be impacted

24:09.970 --> 24:12.929
by Russian sanctions.
Thank you, sir.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.192
That's all that's important.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.367
Well...

24:16.411 --> 24:18.761
let's examine what's important.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.371
Isn't it true,
Mr. Winston, that your firm

24:20.415 --> 24:22.417
is still receiving funds
from Russian clients?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.419
What are you talking about?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.682
STR Laurie's had a marked
uptick in payments

24:26.726 --> 24:28.031
from numbered corporations

24:28.075 --> 24:30.207
registered in the
Cayman Islands.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.383
Isn't STR Laurie
actually making an end run

24:32.427 --> 24:34.342
-around Russian sanctions?
-WINSTON: Absolutely not.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.692
And if there's been any money
coming from Russia,

24:36.736 --> 24:40.174
it's only because the sanctions
laws are so confusing.

24:40.217 --> 24:43.482
How confusing can it be? Just
don't do business with Russia.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.874
That's exactly right,
Your Honor.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.789
Actually, Your Honor,
you'd be amazed

24:46.833 --> 24:48.965
at some of the complexities
of the sanctions regulations.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.445
Democrats just can't

24:50.489 --> 24:52.795
help themselves.
Red tape everywhere.

24:52.839 --> 24:55.015
The "Biden Bloat," is that it?

24:55.058 --> 24:57.452
Exactly. In fact,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.019
isn't it true that you've had to

24:59.062 --> 25:02.152
delay some of your payments
to certain lawyers

25:02.196 --> 25:05.765
at Reddick/Ri'Chard due to this
Democratic micromanaging?

25:05.808 --> 25:08.158
Yes, regretfully.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.986
Democrats again. Assholes.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.249
Now, what's unfair

25:12.293 --> 25:14.556
for an honest businessman
like myself

25:14.600 --> 25:17.124
is that I've had to resort
to cryptocurrency

25:17.167 --> 25:18.865
from a friendly country
like Israel

25:18.908 --> 25:21.215
-to pay certain...
-JULIUS: Uh, let's turn

25:21.258 --> 25:23.652
-to another matter.
-Wait a minute,
you've been laundering money?

25:23.696 --> 25:25.349
JULIUS:
Excuse me, I'm the one
asking questions.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.351
Your client just admitted
to laundering Russian funds

25:27.395 --> 25:29.571
-through Israel.
-No, he did not. Your Honor,

25:29.615 --> 25:32.095
clearly the government is trying
to use any tactic it can...

25:32.139 --> 25:35.011
Your Honor, we request a recess.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.317
[elevator bell dings]

25:39.146 --> 25:42.105
-We need to talk.
-No, I'm heading up.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.281
RI'CHARD:
Sir, the judge gave us
a reprieve until tomorrow.

25:44.325 --> 25:45.674
We need to talk now.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.720
Exactly, I need to talk
to my partner.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.983
So, it's true then,
you're laundering Russian money?

25:50.026 --> 25:53.334
It's not laundering.
Cryptocurrency is legal.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.597
Sir, the government
has excellent

25:55.641 --> 25:57.599
forensic accountants.
They'll follow the money...

25:57.643 --> 25:59.688
Then I'll take the Fifth.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.999
What do you think?

26:06.042 --> 26:08.479
I think he's an idiot,

26:08.523 --> 26:10.046
and we're in big trouble.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.396
You're saying we hired
a white supremacist?

26:12.440 --> 26:14.181
No, I'm just saying

26:14.224 --> 26:15.922
she was leaving
a white supremacist meeting

26:15.965 --> 26:18.011
-last October.
-Marissa?

26:19.229 --> 26:20.666
MARISSA:
[scoffs] I don't know
what to say.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.972
She seemed fine to me,
just normal.

26:23.016 --> 26:25.279
-LIZ: What were you working on?
-Discrimination case
against Ben-Baruch.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.455
Has she asked
for anything unusual?

26:27.498 --> 26:30.153
No, she wanted
to move up the ladder.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.633
She asked the best way.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.069
What did you say?

26:33.113 --> 26:34.723
Uh...

26:34.767 --> 26:36.856
You don't... want to hear this.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.466
-Are you kidding?
Please tell us.
-Of course we do.

26:38.509 --> 26:41.077
[sighs] I told her
to suck up to you two.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.385
That that's the best way
to get ahead.

26:44.428 --> 26:45.734
I was joking.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.431
LIZ:
Okay, so-so what
are we thinking?

26:47.475 --> 26:49.085
-You're having drinks
with her tonight?
-Yeah.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.174
Then have drinks,
but find out what she's about.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.481
Hey.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.875
JAY:
I don't think
that's a good idea.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.225
-Got it.
-[door opens]

27:00.140 --> 27:01.924
Ri'Chard, do you have a minute?

27:03.796 --> 27:06.189
-Sure.
-Uh, Julius, too.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.713
Thanks.

27:12.239 --> 27:15.982
Uh, something came up in court
that we have to talk about.

27:16.025 --> 27:18.027
-Yeah, we have something, too.
-STR Laurie

27:18.071 --> 27:20.464
has been laundering
cryptocurrency through Israel

27:20.508 --> 27:22.728
-to avoid government sanctions.
-What?

27:22.771 --> 27:24.817
Yeah, we were just
gonna go talk to Carmen.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.689
Um, there's a chance
they've been using

27:27.733 --> 27:28.908
her client Ben-Baruch.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.431
What is going on here?

27:30.474 --> 27:31.867
What was your thing?

27:31.911 --> 27:33.956
You said something
happened here, too.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.611
Oh, yeah, it looks like we may
have hired a white supremacist.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.482
What?

27:38.526 --> 27:40.267
Do you want me to find
the precedents for the

27:40.310 --> 27:42.008
-2012 decision?
-No, I'll get it.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.313
-It's no trouble.
-Go home.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.576
-I'm fine.
-Okay.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.753
Hey, do you think
something weird is going on

27:47.796 --> 27:49.276
over there?

27:54.542 --> 27:56.326
I don't know. Um...

27:56.370 --> 27:58.111
I think they're just worried
about Ben-Baruch.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.678
Okay.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.245
Are you sure you want
to head out with her?

28:02.289 --> 28:04.247
Are you kidding?
This is what I'm good at.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.685
Call if something's up.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.517
-Shall we do it?
-Yeah, sure. Let me,
let me get my things.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.869
-Hey, what's going on?
-I wouldn't know where to start.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.572
Carmen, you got a minute?

28:26.966 --> 28:29.708
What do you have going
with Ben-Baruch?

28:29.751 --> 28:31.535
Nothing.

28:31.579 --> 28:32.928
We're working on
a discrimination suit,

28:32.972 --> 28:34.669
and we've been

28:34.713 --> 28:37.803
assessing his liability
following a sale of assets.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.501
I just came from court where
STR Laurie admitted to using

28:40.544 --> 28:43.809
cryptocurrency to launder
Russian money through Israel.

28:43.852 --> 28:46.812
When was the last time
you talked to Ben-Baruch?

28:48.117 --> 28:51.642
Um... I'm not sure, sir.
Couple of weeks ago?

29:03.611 --> 29:05.221
What are you doing?

29:05.265 --> 29:07.702
Using your company phone
to dial your last ten numbers.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.617
Uh, sir, that is not a...

29:09.660 --> 29:11.575
Then tell us the truth.

29:15.231 --> 29:18.017
I've been ordered
to do everything I've done.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.497
By whom?

29:20.541 --> 29:21.847
Mr. Osman.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.023
He came to me.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.894
RI'CHARD:
You connected him to Ben-Baruch

29:25.938 --> 29:28.592
to make cryptocurrency
transfers?

29:30.812 --> 29:32.814
Why didn't you tell us?

29:32.858 --> 29:35.904
Mr. Osman asked me not to.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.341
You work for us.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.430
You don't work for Mr. Osman

29:40.474 --> 29:43.216
or STR Laurie or anybody else.

29:43.259 --> 29:46.610
My understanding is, we're
an LLC acquired by STR Laurie,

29:46.654 --> 29:48.612
who retains
final authority over all

29:48.656 --> 29:50.571
financial matters
and personnel...

29:50.614 --> 29:53.008
As long as you are part
of this firm,

29:53.052 --> 29:55.228
who you represent

29:55.271 --> 29:57.491
will be determined by us!

30:04.672 --> 30:06.848
-Do you want my resignation?
-We'll let you know.

30:10.069 --> 30:13.768
We're in the crazy times,
aren't we?

30:13.812 --> 30:15.378
Yeah, we seem to be.

30:16.945 --> 30:19.818
-So, do we fire her?
-No.

30:19.861 --> 30:22.124
STR Laurie will know
we're onto them

30:22.168 --> 30:24.257
and just rehire her.

30:24.300 --> 30:27.216
Yeah, but we got to get them
to drop this case

30:27.260 --> 30:29.305
-against the government.
-Yeah, without a doubt.

30:29.349 --> 30:32.134
My bigger worry is,
because of Carmen,

30:32.178 --> 30:35.007
the government
could come after us.

30:35.050 --> 30:38.706
Not if the white supremacists
don't get us first.

30:38.749 --> 30:41.883
[laughs]

30:46.409 --> 30:49.412
Okay. Somebody came to party.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.588
-Are you gonna drink that shot?
-No, I'm gonna give it to you,

30:51.632 --> 30:53.199
just like the Israeli government

30:53.242 --> 30:54.591
gave back land
after the Six-Day War.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.593
What do you think about Zionism?

30:56.637 --> 30:58.073
Mm...

30:58.117 --> 31:01.598
Woody Allen...
made a lot of great movies,

31:01.642 --> 31:03.165
but I don't know
if I can watch them anymore.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.515
-BARTENDER: Here you go.
-Um...

31:05.559 --> 31:06.995
Thank you.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.997
The bartender's kind of cute.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.781
Yeah, he is cute.

31:10.825 --> 31:14.611
And he's Latino. What are
your opinions on immigration?

31:14.655 --> 31:17.484
Boring. No heavy political talk.

31:17.527 --> 31:18.920
Okay, what do you want
to talk about?

31:18.964 --> 31:20.487
Office gossip.

31:20.530 --> 31:21.749
Well, I've certainly
been there long enough.

31:21.792 --> 31:22.881
What do you want to know about?

31:22.924 --> 31:25.187
Carmen. I find her fascinating.

31:25.231 --> 31:26.885
Really? Tell me more.

31:26.928 --> 31:29.496
No, no, not like that,
not sexually. I just mean, like,

31:29.539 --> 31:31.585
the way she dresses
and her steely demeanor

31:31.628 --> 31:33.892
-and how focused she is.
-Yeah?

31:33.935 --> 31:36.895
And she gets the juiciest cases.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.244
What do you mean?

31:39.941 --> 31:41.508
I think I need some water.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.076
No, no. There's no
turning back now. More shots.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.572
[line ringing]

32:04.792 --> 32:07.360
I need you to run down
an Uber destination for me.

32:11.799 --> 32:14.367
-Good news and bad news.
-Uh, really bad news.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.195
The good news is

32:16.238 --> 32:18.110
that our paralegal
Susan Tremont

32:18.153 --> 32:19.459
probably isn't
a white supremacist.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.417
Okay. What's the
really bad news?

32:21.461 --> 32:23.942
[sighs] She's an FBI agent.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.907
I tracked her to an address
at an office park in Winnetka.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.213
Regional office of the FBI.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.736
What about that photo?

32:35.779 --> 32:37.346
Her meeting
with the white supremacists.

32:37.390 --> 32:40.784
We think that might be part
of her work for the FBI.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.004
What does the FBI want with us?

32:43.048 --> 32:45.659
Maybe they're going
after STR Laurie.

32:45.702 --> 32:48.096
But maybe they're also
going after us.

32:51.056 --> 32:54.494
What do you know
about Susan Tremont?

32:55.799 --> 32:58.933
Paralegal. Friendly. Eager.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.761
LIZ:
How so?

33:00.804 --> 33:04.373
She asks questions, and I try,
as a second-year,

33:04.417 --> 33:05.940
to help her when I have time.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.464
Have you included her
in any of your cases?

33:08.508 --> 33:10.553
Just the discrimination suit.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.210
May I ask, why the questions?

33:15.254 --> 33:16.733
Your files are
password-protected, I assume.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.300
Of course.

33:18.344 --> 33:20.520
You have high-profile clients.
Oscar Rivi,

33:20.563 --> 33:22.957
Wolfe-Colman, Ben-Baruch,

33:23.001 --> 33:24.785
-among others.
-CARMEN: Yes.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.352
Has Susan asked about them?

33:30.051 --> 33:32.619
Not specifically. Just a...

33:32.662 --> 33:35.187
-general interest.
-LIZ: We, of course, assume

33:35.230 --> 33:36.884
that you've never crossed

33:36.927 --> 33:39.756
any legal line to help them.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.062
Have you?

33:41.106 --> 33:42.585
Is Susan a cop?

33:42.629 --> 33:45.023
Is she an undercover cop?

33:45.066 --> 33:47.199
No.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.722
She's FBI.

33:49.940 --> 33:50.941
Oh, fuck.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.161
You are confident

33:53.205 --> 33:55.294
that you have not
shown her anything,

33:55.337 --> 33:57.557
or done anything illegal?

33:59.472 --> 34:00.864
Carmen?

34:00.908 --> 34:02.344
[hits desk]

34:03.824 --> 34:05.086
She's after Ben-Baruch.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.349
She's been asking about

34:07.393 --> 34:09.656
getting deeper into his case.

34:09.699 --> 34:11.527
Okay.

34:11.571 --> 34:14.356
You need to assign her
to busy work.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.923
Don't brush her off.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.794
Keep her on some earlier filing.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.927
Ben-Baruch's immigration case.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.537
Oh, good. That's completed work.

34:21.581 --> 34:24.105
LIZ: Yeah, and make her think
it's a step up,

34:24.149 --> 34:26.586
-like a promotion,
that you love her work.
-Mm.

34:28.631 --> 34:30.198
We shouldn't be talking
about this down here.

34:30.242 --> 34:31.199
She'll get suspicious.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.722
True.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.159
Wait.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.900
Have her do the filing
on the union case,

34:36.944 --> 34:38.772
the teamsters case
from last year.

34:38.815 --> 34:39.860
Why?

34:39.903 --> 34:42.993
It'll come in handy. Trust me.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.782
[door opens, closes]

34:53.395 --> 34:54.701
What do we think?

34:54.744 --> 34:56.616
LIZ:
Carmen hates being tricked.

34:56.659 --> 34:57.921
She'll do wonders for us.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.662
I agree.

34:59.706 --> 35:01.360
We have to get to court.

35:01.403 --> 35:03.492
Yup. You, too.

35:04.493 --> 35:07.453
Thank you, Mr. Willoughby,
for joining us.

35:07.496 --> 35:10.369
My duty as an American,
lawyer man.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.414
-Your Honor.
-Mr. Willoughby.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.721
This isn't your first time

35:14.764 --> 35:17.419
in a courtroom, is it,
Mr. Carlson-- I mean,

35:17.463 --> 35:19.943
Mr. Tucker-- I'm sorry,
Mr., uh, Willoughby?

35:19.987 --> 35:21.467
No. It's sort of surprising

35:21.510 --> 35:23.860
because I'm actually
a very nice guy.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.515
But you and your employer
were sued

35:26.559 --> 35:28.778
in... 2020,

35:28.822 --> 35:31.041
-weren't you?
-Go figure.

35:31.085 --> 35:34.697
-Is that a yes?
-Uh, sorry. Yes. [laughs]

35:34.741 --> 35:38.048
EDWARD:
[chuckles] A-And what did that
lawsuit accuse you of?

35:38.092 --> 35:41.182
Uh, defamation, slander,
stuff like that.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.706
Wh-- You won that case,
didn't you?

35:43.750 --> 35:46.709
I did. We did, which was nice.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.015
Objection. Relevance.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.322
Well, I have some time.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.846
Let's see what the relevance is.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.848
EDWARD:
Do you remember why the judge

35:54.891 --> 35:57.372
sided with you in that case,
Mr. Willoughby?

35:57.416 --> 36:00.332
TED:
Basically, he said that
no reasonable person

36:00.375 --> 36:01.768
should take me seriously,

36:01.811 --> 36:03.596
which sounds like an insult,

36:03.639 --> 36:06.120
but Tucker Carlson got
the same pass, and he gets

36:06.164 --> 36:09.254
paid millions a year,
so that's pretty serious.

36:09.297 --> 36:12.474
Okay, and why should
no reasonable person

36:12.518 --> 36:13.954
take you seriously?

36:13.997 --> 36:17.087
Well, what I do
is more like commentary.

36:17.131 --> 36:19.786
Like Tucker.
You know, non-literal,

36:19.829 --> 36:21.962
non-factual. It's just for fun.

36:22.005 --> 36:25.748
[chuckles] So, uh,
blaming you for violence

36:25.792 --> 36:29.404
or the-the threat of violence
would be absurd?

36:29.448 --> 36:31.580
I am against violence.
Everybody knows that.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.539
Look behind them.

36:33.582 --> 36:34.975
EDWARD:
Uh, no further questions.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.065
Willoughby's lawyer?

36:38.108 --> 36:39.806
-My guess.
-Okay.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.112
Mr. Willoughby...

36:42.156 --> 36:43.462
Ted's fine.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.116
Uh, Ted, um,

36:46.160 --> 36:49.076
your shows, which you described
as "just for fun,"

36:49.119 --> 36:51.687
they take on some
pretty serious issues,

36:51.731 --> 36:53.689
-don't they?
-That depends.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.604
Abortion. Immigration.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.085
Ukraine. Putin. Trump.

36:58.128 --> 37:01.219
I'd-I'd call those
serious issues, wouldn't you?

37:01.262 --> 37:03.830
Sure. I like dealing
with issues.

37:03.873 --> 37:06.398
Well, in the, in the last year,

37:06.441 --> 37:09.270
you have done 74 segments

37:09.314 --> 37:11.098
on "Black on white violence"

37:11.141 --> 37:13.927
-in Chicago.
-TED: [scoffs] Somebody counted?

37:13.970 --> 37:16.016
LIZ:
Not to mention

37:16.059 --> 37:19.280
all the stories you did
mentioning college president,

37:19.324 --> 37:21.021
Angela Allen-Hellman,

37:21.064 --> 37:22.979
-by name.
-I'm so flattered.

37:23.023 --> 37:25.765
Mr. Willoughby,
why are you biased

37:25.808 --> 37:26.809
-against Black people?
-Objection.

37:26.853 --> 37:28.071
MEACHEM:
Sustained.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.725
Oh, my God, I'm not biased.

37:29.769 --> 37:32.293
Somebody attacked me
at my Connecticut feed store

37:32.337 --> 37:35.122
and said the same thing,
and I said, "I'm not a bad guy."

37:35.165 --> 37:37.690
Each morning,
we get a network memo,

37:37.733 --> 37:40.388
and they decide what we cover.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.740
-[whispering]
-[Diane mouths]

37:44.784 --> 37:46.742
TED:
I'm just the messenger.

37:46.786 --> 37:50.180
Mr. Willoughby, this
"network memo," who writes it?

37:51.965 --> 37:53.793
Gosh. I don't know exactly who.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.404
It just tells us how to keep

37:56.448 --> 37:57.927
the audience enraged-- engaged!

37:57.971 --> 37:59.755
EDWARD: Uh...
[clears throat] Your Honor,

37:59.799 --> 38:01.801
uh, I ask for a short recess.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.411
I'll bet you do.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.371
[clears throat]

38:06.414 --> 38:07.981
EDWARD:
All right, we'll settle.

38:08.024 --> 38:09.635
ANGELA:
Ah. Expect to pay

38:09.678 --> 38:11.724
through the nose after
putting us through all this.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.508
That's fine.
The funds aren't coming

38:13.552 --> 38:15.075
-from Ridley Mutual.
-It's Fox, isn't it?

38:15.118 --> 38:17.730
Uh, cost-benefit analysis.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.950
Paying you versus allowing one
of their network stars to say

38:20.994 --> 38:22.125
one more fucking word
off-script.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.519
Okay, we'll talk
numbers tomorrow.

38:24.563 --> 38:27.043
-You wanted to see me?
-Uh, you've been asking

38:27.087 --> 38:29.263
if I have any
extra work for you.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.786
Does that offer still stand?

38:30.830 --> 38:33.485
Absolutely. It would be
my pleasure to help.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.878
Great. These files
are essential,

38:35.922 --> 38:39.142
but someone threw off the
alphabetization and the dates.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.318
Look through them closely

38:40.361 --> 38:42.058
and organize them for me?

38:42.102 --> 38:44.365
Yeah, on it.
What-What's the case about?

38:44.409 --> 38:47.063
-Oh, you'll see.
-Okay.

38:52.591 --> 38:54.767
LIZ:
Look at that.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.204
Looks almost like
nothing ever happened.

38:58.205 --> 39:00.425
[chuckles] I kind of
like him headless.

39:00.468 --> 39:03.123
Mm. Looks good from the street.

39:05.604 --> 39:08.215
So, how is your
Buddhism thing going?

39:08.258 --> 39:10.086
Om...

39:10.130 --> 39:12.306
-I don't know.
-[both laughing]

39:14.003 --> 39:16.397
Liz?

39:16.441 --> 39:18.791
-Yes?
-Can we share secrets?

39:18.834 --> 39:20.836
Oh, I hope so.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.882
Mm, no, as in,

39:22.925 --> 39:25.014
you can never tell anyone.

39:25.058 --> 39:27.234
Oh, fuck, tell me.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.631
I kissed my doctor.

39:32.674 --> 39:35.285
Your doctor?

39:35.329 --> 39:36.983
I can still feel it.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.551
I mean, it was... it was a kiss.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.988
And did he kiss you back?

39:43.337 --> 39:45.426
Well, he didn't pull away,

39:45.470 --> 39:48.081
but he didn't pull me
to him, so...

39:48.124 --> 39:49.474
I'm not sure.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.954
I don't think
I could kiss my doctor.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.479
[both laugh]

39:54.522 --> 39:58.396
Wait, did you-- were you wearing
a paper gown? [laughs]

39:58.439 --> 40:00.310
Diane?

40:00.354 --> 40:03.096
He was standing in the doorway,

40:03.139 --> 40:05.881
and he gave me this.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.492
Oh, no.

40:07.535 --> 40:09.363
-What happened?
-LIZ: What is that?

40:09.407 --> 40:10.408
What kind of doctor is this?

40:12.018 --> 40:15.282
You know him. Lyle Bettencourt.

40:15.325 --> 40:18.503
Wait, is he the one that
testified in the gene therapy--

40:18.546 --> 40:21.462
Wait, the... silver hair
and the glasses?

40:21.506 --> 40:23.682
Okay, yes. Yes, I approve.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.988
Yes, you can kiss him.
Wait, can I kiss him?

40:26.032 --> 40:27.207
No! Only me.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.774
-[both laughing]
-He is gorgeous.

40:28.817 --> 40:31.777
I know.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.780
And he can talk
about Verdi and Dante

40:34.823 --> 40:36.738
and Dahlia Lithwick.

40:36.782 --> 40:40.002
[laughing] Wow.

40:40.046 --> 40:44.485
Okay. All right, so,
now I am going to ask you

40:44.529 --> 40:47.662
the here-it-is question...

40:47.706 --> 40:50.448
Where's Kurt?

40:50.491 --> 40:51.927
I mean, he's away again,

40:51.971 --> 40:54.930
working for the NRA.

40:54.974 --> 40:57.759
He's... he's away a lot.

40:57.803 --> 41:01.154
Well, and even when he,
when he's here, I mean...

41:02.808 --> 41:04.853
[sighs] It was one thing

41:04.897 --> 41:07.247
to be political opposites
years ago,

41:07.290 --> 41:09.771
but now, I mean...

41:09.815 --> 41:11.730
I mean, the divide is...

41:11.773 --> 41:13.427
a chasm.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.560
Gun control. Roe v. Wade.

41:15.603 --> 41:17.736
The Supreme Court.

41:17.779 --> 41:19.912
Diane, I was

41:19.955 --> 41:22.175
married and divorced twice,

41:22.218 --> 41:24.438
and I would suggest

41:24.482 --> 41:28.224
that you figure out
what you really want,

41:28.268 --> 41:31.140
and not just what you think
you want at the moment.

41:32.794 --> 41:34.448
You have regrets?

41:34.492 --> 41:37.059
[groans] Wow.

41:37.103 --> 41:38.800
There's always regrets.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.237
With Adrian, or...

41:41.281 --> 41:44.023
What-what was
the other one's name?

41:44.066 --> 41:46.895
Ian. [laughs]

41:46.939 --> 41:50.638
A-- Well, Adrian...
Adrian was impossible.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.422
And with Ian, I...

41:54.381 --> 41:57.863
I don't know, maybe I was
the one who was impossible.

42:00.169 --> 42:02.041
But divorce is hell.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.219
Yeah, but you seem happy.

42:07.742 --> 42:10.658
That's 'cause I love my son.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.486
Oh, he is so much fun.

42:13.487 --> 42:14.880
Hmm.

42:14.923 --> 42:16.621
Well, I don't have that.

42:16.664 --> 42:19.667
What are you gonna do?

42:19.711 --> 42:22.409
[sighs] I honestly don't know.

42:22.452 --> 42:23.889
[laughs]

42:23.932 --> 42:27.370
-Diane.
-However,

42:27.414 --> 42:30.243
I do have
an appointment tomorrow.

42:30.286 --> 42:32.593
[laughs]
Well, then,

42:32.637 --> 42:34.987
I think you should
take it much further.

42:35.030 --> 42:37.032
-I know. Really. Right?
-Yes.

42:37.076 --> 42:39.165
-All the way. Right?
-Wait. Yes.

It's come to our attention
that the FBI is planning

43:18.421 --> 43:20.380
to pursue a case
against STR Laurie.

43:21.381 --> 43:23.513
That's not something
I can discuss with you.

43:23.557 --> 43:25.254
We're not here to discuss it.

43:25.298 --> 43:27.430
We're here to share this
with you.

43:27.474 --> 43:30.477
You can go after STS Laurie
if you so desire,

43:30.520 --> 43:33.654
but we are prepared to expose
your unconstitutional

43:33.698 --> 43:36.309
search and seizure in the
warehouse union investigation.

43:36.352 --> 43:38.703
[scoffs]

43:38.746 --> 43:41.706
The FBI isn't involved
in any union investigation.

43:41.749 --> 43:44.534
And even if we were, that has
nothing to do with this.

43:44.578 --> 43:47.494
Ah. But we have evidence.

43:47.537 --> 43:49.409
I love a bluff.

43:51.541 --> 43:53.413
Carmen?

43:53.456 --> 43:55.284
Hi. I'm Carmen Moyo.

43:55.328 --> 43:57.591
I've been working with your
undercover agent Susan Tremont.

43:59.201 --> 44:00.681
No idea who you're
talking about.

44:00.725 --> 44:02.074
Let me refresh your memory.

44:02.117 --> 44:05.512
This is Susan Tremont.

44:05.555 --> 44:08.384
Your undercover agent.

44:08.428 --> 44:09.734
Will not confirm or deny
if I know this...

44:09.777 --> 44:11.387
This is Susan Tremont.

44:11.431 --> 44:14.086
This is also Susan Tremont.

44:14.129 --> 44:16.610
And my personal favorite,
a close-up of,

44:16.654 --> 44:20.527
you guessed it, Susan Tremont
working on our teamster case,

44:20.570 --> 44:24.792
organizing files and
scanning every single one.

44:24.836 --> 44:26.098
We also have video.

44:30.624 --> 44:32.408
I have no idea
who gave her permission

44:32.452 --> 44:35.194
to search these files, or how
you think this is relevant,

44:35.237 --> 44:37.109
but... [exhales sharply]

44:37.152 --> 44:40.329
that's all the time
I have for you today.

44:40.373 --> 44:41.722
