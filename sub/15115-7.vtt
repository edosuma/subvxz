WEBVTT

00:00.876 --> 00:03.295
‐ <i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BUNHEADS"...</i>
‐ DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE?

00:03.295 --> 00:07.132
‐ NOPE.
‐ I STAYED OUT ALL NIGHT
AND WRECKED MOM'S CAR.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.009
‐ ( rips )
‐ ( gasps )

00:09.009 --> 00:11.428
I GOT MY LETTER TODAY
FROM THE JOFFREY.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.598
‐ WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS SAY?
‐ I'LL TELL THEM WHEN
I GET BACK.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.935
‐ YOU CAN'T JUST UP AND LEAVE.
‐ LOOK, THEY WON'T EVEN
NOTICE I'M GONE.

00:17.935 --> 00:21.188
‐ YOU LIKE JOSH.
‐ YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
SINCE, WHAT? THIRD GRADE?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.649
‐ SECOND. MISS MARSH'S CLASS.
‐ WHAT'S THE POINT, MICHELLE?

00:23.649 --> 00:27.110
‐ THE POINT IS YOU HAVE CLASSES.
‐ I KNOW. AND HOW WONDERFUL
THAT YOU'RE THERE

00:27.110 --> 00:29.696
SO I CAN GET AWAY FOR A WEEK
AND THEN YOU CAN TEACH THEM.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.200
‐ <i>( piano playing )</i>
‐ LEAN FORWARD.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.829
THAT'S IT.
STRAIGHT KNEES.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.542
EXTEND DOWN, CHIN UP.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.210
EHH.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.462
GRACEFULLY, GRACEFULLY,

00:45.462 --> 00:47.756
GRACEFULLY. YES.

00:47.756 --> 00:52.219
‐ I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
‐ AGAIN? UHH.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.054
‐ OKAY, LADIES.
‐ <i>( piano stops )</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:57.140
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
THE COLD HARD REALITY

00:57.140 --> 01:00.102
OF LIFE AS A DANCER.
WHEN YOU'RE ON BROADWAY

01:00.102 --> 01:02.104
THE SHOW DOESN'T STOP
SO YOU CAN GO POTTY.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.147
"LES MIS" IS
THREE HOURS LONG,

01:04.147 --> 01:05.983
<i>AND SURE THERE'S</i>
<i>AN INTERMISSION,</i>

01:05.983 --> 01:08.777
BUT BETWEEN CHANGING COSTUMES
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IF MARIUS IS STRAIGHT,

01:08.777 --> 01:11.572
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE TIME TO PEE.
YOU'VE GOT TO HOLD IT.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.408
SO FROM NOW ON
WE ARE ALL GOING
TO TRY VERY HARD TO‐‐

01:14.408 --> 01:16.285
<i>( whimpering )</i>

01:16.285 --> 01:19.204
OKAY.
NOTE TO SELF:

01:19.204 --> 01:21.456
POTTY BREAK FIRST,
"LES MIS" LECTURE LATER.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.918
WHOEVER ELSE NEEDS TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM, GO AHEAD.
GO NOW.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.045
WOW, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

01:27.045 --> 01:29.590
IN MY DAY
WE ALL HAD BLADDERS.
( sighs )

01:29.590 --> 01:32.759
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS
MY LAST CLASS OF THE DAY.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.470
‐ NOPE, YOU STILL HAVE‐‐
‐ ROOMBA! I JUST REMEMBERED.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.931
IT'S "ZUMBA."
TOMORROW'S A BIG DAY TOO.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.225
‐ YOU HAVE JAZZERCISE AT 9:00‐‐
‐ UGH, SKINNY PEOPLE.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.311
YOU TEACH
THE WEITZMAN COUPLE THEIR
WEDDING DANCE AT 10:00‐‐

01:42.311 --> 01:45.188
‐ UGH, HAPPY PEOPLE.
‐ THEN IT'S A SOLD‐OUT
SWING CLASS.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.150
‐ UGH, PEOPLE.
‐ THEN JAZZ AT 3:00,
PAS DE DEUX AT 4:15,

01:48.150 --> 01:51.028
‐ AND HIP‐HOP
LINE DANCING AT 5:30.
‐ WHAT'S HIP‐HOP LINE DANCING?

01:51.028 --> 01:53.155
TWO CLASSES
WERE UNDERBOOKED,
SO I COMBINED THEM.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.490
THIS IS NOT WORKING!
I CAN'T TEACH MY CLASSES

01:55.490 --> 01:57.993
AND FANNY'S CLASSES
AND MAINTAIN MY SEXY.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.121
‐ THANK GOD SHE'S BACK TOMORROW!
‐ OH...

02:01.121 --> 02:04.875
‐ "OH"? WHAT "OH"?
‐ FANNY EXTENDED HER TRIP.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.253
‐ SHE'S NOT
COMING BACK UNTIL NEXT WEEK.
‐ WHAT? WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL ME?

02:08.253 --> 02:11.131
‐ SHE POSTED IT ON FACEBOOK.
‐ THAT DOESN'T COUNT
AS TELLING ME.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.508
WHY DO PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN
JUST SHARE NEWS ON FACEBOOK

02:13.508 --> 02:15.385
AND AUTOMATICALLY
EVERYONE WILL KNOW?

02:15.385 --> 02:17.179
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S
ON FACEBOOK.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.681
I'M HERE. I MADE IT.
I'M NOT LATE!

02:19.681 --> 02:22.476
‐ I THOUGHT IT WAS WEDNESDAY.
‐ YOU ARE LATE AND IT IS
WEDNESDAY.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.227
RATS.
RIGHT. SORRY, BOO.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.146
BUT TO MAKE IT UP:
AIR FRIES.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.273
WHAT ARE AIR FRIES?
BY THE WAY, I'M MICHELLE.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
NANETTE.
NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.195
‐ AIR FRIES ARE
FRIES COOKED IN AIR.
‐ THEY'RE NOT ON MY DIET.

02:33.195 --> 02:36.156
‐ BUT THEY DON'T TASTE GOOD,
THAT MEANS THEY'RE HEALTHY.
‐ THEY'RE STILL POTATOES.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.949
I LIKE POTATOES.
I LIKE AIR.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.494
ARE YOU TEACHING
MY DAUGHTER TO STRIP?

02:40.494 --> 02:44.081
NO JUDGMENT.
I ALWAYS TELL HER SHE SHOULD
HAVE SOMETHING TO FALL BACK ON.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.291
I FIGURED TYPING,
BUT THIS COULD BE GOOD TOO.

02:46.291 --> 02:50.462
WE'RE ADDING SOME NEW CLASSES.
CARDIO‐STRIPTEASE WILL NOW BE
OFFERED FRIDAYS AT 10:00,

02:50.462 --> 02:53.298
RIGHT BETWEEN
"I WISH I WAS STILL IN BED"
AND "WHERE DID I GO WRONG?"

02:53.298 --> 02:56.551
‐ ( laughs, gasps )
RUBY'S MARKET!
‐ WHAT ABOUT RUBY'S MARKET?

02:56.551 --> 02:58.428
I LEFT YOUR BROTHER
AT THE PRODUCE SECTION
AT RUBY'S MARKET!

02:58.428 --> 03:00.305
‐ AGAIN?
‐ GET YOUR STUFF, WE GOTTA GO.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.229
‐ WOW, THESE ARE GROSS.
‐ ( girl screaming )

03:10.607 --> 03:12.442
I SHOULD PROBABLY
LOOK INTO THAT.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.907
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:37.426 --> 03:40.220
‐ SO NO SASHA TODAY.
‐ I KNOW, MISSING CLASS‐‐
SCANDAL.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.347
‐ YOU HEAR FROM HER?
‐ NOT SINCE THE MOVIE‐TRUCK
NIGHT.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.225
‐ I TEXTED HER TWICE.
NO RESPONSE.
‐ SO WEIRD.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.893
HEY, BOO?
ANY WORD FROM SASHA?

03:46.893 --> 03:50.397
I LEFT MESSAGES.
MAYBE SHE FINALLY
GOT IN TROUBLE.

03:50.397 --> 03:54.151
‐ SASHA NEVER GETS IN TROUBLE.
‐ SHE DID STAY OUT ALL NIGHT
AND WRECK HER MOM'S CAR.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.070
‐ AND HER MOM LOVES THAT CAR.
‐ THE CAR WAS IN THE CHRISTMAS‐
CARD PICTURE.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.489
‐ THE FATHER WAS NOT.
‐ EVERY PARENT HAS
THEIR LIMIT, I GUESS.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.950
MAYBE SHE'S TOTALLY
GROUNDED FOR LIKE MONTHS.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.786
WHAT IF THEY SENT HER AWAY?
WHAT IF SHE'S IN MILITARY
SCHOOL?

04:04.786 --> 04:06.663
I DON'T THINK SHE'S
IN MILITARY SCHOOL.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.457
I'D LIKE TO GO
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.959
‐ NO, YOU DON'T.
‐ I DO. I THINK
IT WOULD BE REALLY‐‐

04:10.959 --> 04:13.336
OH WAIT. I'M THINKING
OF CAMP, SORRY.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.547
I HAVE TO GO. TEXT ME
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.258
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?
‐ JOSH AND I HAVE
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.385
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
EIGHT YEARS‐‐ INSANE.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.721
I KNOW. JOSH IS
COMING OVER AND I HAVE
THIS GREAT NIGHT PLANNED.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.890
‐ IT'S NOT THAT MURDER‐MYSTERY
DINNER THING, IS IT?
‐ NO.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.100
BECAUSE FRANKLY, I WOULD'VE
DUMPED YOUR ASS
OVER THAT ONE.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.562
THERE'S A FOOD‐TRUCK FAIR
GOING ON IN GOLETA AND THERE'S
A STAGE AND BANDS ARE PLAYING.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.647
‐ WOW, THAT ACTUALLY
SOUNDS FUN.
‐ I KNOW.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.399
‐ I MEAN, IT'S SO NOT
THE TWO OF YOU‐‐
‐ STOP.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.610
SERIOUSLY, WHAT DID YOU DO
FOR YOUR FIFTH ANNIVERSARY?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.571
‐ WE SAW "HOTEL FOR DOGS."
‐ YEAH, I WOULD'VE DUMPED
YOUR ASS FOR THAT ONE TOO.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.782
WELL, THIS IS GOING
TO BE REALLY GREAT.
I'M EXCITED.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.909
‐ <i>( phone ringing )</i>
‐ SASHA?

04:43.909 --> 04:45.327
MAYBE.

04:47.204 --> 04:50.332
‐ HEY THERE, OLD MAN.
‐ THAT NICKNAME'S BEGGING
FOR AN ASSDUMPING TOO, F.Y.I.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.209
YEAH, I'M JUST GETTING READY
TO LEAVE NOW.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.419
I'LL RUSH HOME, SHOWER
AND SHOULD BE READY TO GO‐‐

04:55.754 --> 04:58.924
OH, BUT COULDN'T IT‐‐
WELL, I KIND OF HAD THINGS ALL‐‐

04:59.925 --> 05:02.552
NO. THAT'S NICE TOO.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.096
I KNOW. OKAY.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.350
SEE YOU THEN.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.602
OOPS. WHAT?

05:10.602 --> 05:14.189
HE'S AT MY HOUSE PUTTING
TOGETHER AN ENTERTAINMENT
CABINET THAT MY MOM JUST BOUGHT.

05:14.189 --> 05:17.108
AND IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED
AND SHE REALLY WANTS IT
READY BY TOMORROW,

05:17.108 --> 05:18.985
BECAUSE SHE'S HOSTING
THIS BROKERS' LUNCHEON

05:18.985 --> 05:21.321
AND SHE WANTS THE LIVING ROOM
TO LOOK COMPLETE,
WHICH IT HASN'T

05:21.321 --> 05:23.240
SINCE MY DAD LEFT AND TOOK
THE OLD CABINET WITH HIM.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.200
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH YOUR ANNIVERSARY?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.410
‐ HE WON'T BE DONE IN TIME
TO DRIVE TO GOLETA.
‐ YOU'RE KIDDING.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.247
SO MY MOM SAID SHE'LL TAKE US
OUT FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY
TONIGHT INSTEAD.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.374
SHE MADE RESERVATIONS
AT THAT NEW SUSHI PLACE.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.418
‐ OH. WELL, YOU LIKE SUSHI.
‐ UH‐HUH, EXCEPT FOR THE FISH.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.379
‐ RIGHT.
‐ BUT THE CUCUMBER ROLLS‐‐
AWESOME.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.507
SO AWESOME.
MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN
FOOD TRUCK IT NEXT WEEKEND?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.551
‐ DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S FINE.
‐ AND BRIGHT SIDE:

05:42.551 --> 05:45.387
NOW YOU HAVE
SOME EXTRA MONEY, RIGHT?
FOR BOOZE AND BROADS?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.264
ABSOLUTELY.
GOTTA GO.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.851
HEY, EIGHT YEARS,
RIGHT ON!

05:58.525 --> 06:00.443
<i>( music playing,</i>
<i>taps clicking )</i>

06:05.115 --> 06:07.617
I REMEMBER THIS SONG
BEING MUCH SHORTER.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.453
SERIOUSLY, DID IT
LOOP BACK AROUND?

06:10.453 --> 06:13.248
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO DANCE
TO "MOVES LIKE JAGGER."

06:13.248 --> 06:15.959
‐ THAT SONG REALLY
GETS TO THE POINT!
‐ NEXT TIME, SAM.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.545
I DON'T THINK THERE'S GONNA
BE A NEXT TIME FOR YOU.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.590
IS THAT IT?
IS CLASS OVER?

06:23.258 --> 06:25.343
‐ <i>( music stops )</i>
‐ ALL RIGHT, I GOT A PULSE.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.637
‐ THAT'S A WRAP, EVERYONE.
‐ IS IT OVER?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.306
‐ OH, IT'S OVER.
‐ DID I WIN?

06:29.306 --> 06:32.100
‐ SURE, SWEETIE.
‐ NICE CLASS, EVERYBODY.
COME BACK NEXT WEEK

06:32.100 --> 06:33.810
WHEN THE PART OF ME
WILL BE PLAYED
BY ANNA FARIS.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.854
‐ YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD, MICHELLE.
‐ I'M SO SORRY, SAM,

06:35.854 --> 06:37.606
DID YOU SAY
"TAP‐A‐TAP‐A‐TAP‐A"?

06:37.606 --> 06:40.275
‐ I THINK YOU NEED SOME SLEEP.
‐ AND SOME SLEEP.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.903
‐ I JUST SAID THAT.
‐ HAS TAP DANCING ALWAYS
BEEN SO LOUD?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.572
UNLESS A COWBOY IS SHOOTING
BULLETS AT YOUR FEET,

06:45.572 --> 06:47.616
IT'S THE LOUDEST DANCE
THERE IS.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.451
‐ I'LL SEE YA LATER.
‐ SEE YA.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.620
( water dripping )

06:52.412 --> 06:54.456
UGH.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.000
( faintly )
OH MY GOD.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.174
‐ <i>( water trickling )</i>
‐ OH NO.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.843
NO NO NO!

07:08.303 --> 07:10.555
NO NO NO NO NO NO!

07:10.555 --> 07:13.016
OH GOD.
OH MY GOD.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.517
OH MY‐‐

07:14.517 --> 07:15.769
M‐MY GOD.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.605
OKAY, HELLO, UM...

07:18.605 --> 07:20.815
UH UH UH...

07:20.815 --> 07:23.485

07:23.485 --> 07:25.028
OH MY GOD.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.416
PICK UP,
STOP!

07:38.416 --> 07:40.126
PICK UP. STOP!
PICK UP!

07:40.126 --> 07:42.504
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>
<i>Fanny Flowers.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

07:42.504 --> 07:44.923
FANNY, IT'S MICHELLE.
IT'S COMING FROM THE CEILING.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.884
THERE'S WATER COMING
FROM THE CEILING AND IT'S
FLOODING THE DRESSING ROOM

07:47.884 --> 07:50.261
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP IT
OR HOW LONG IT'S BEEN GOING ON.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.097
OH GOD, I WISH YOU WERE THERE
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.891
UH, LET'S SEE, IF YOU
WERE THERE, YOU'D PROBABLY
SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

07:54.891 --> 07:57.560
"WELL, MICHELLE, MAYBE IF
YOU DIDN'T SLEEP UNTIL 11:00

07:57.560 --> 07:59.646
AND STUMBLE INTO CLASS
LIKE A HOBO, YOU COULD'VE

07:59.646 --> 08:02.440
CHECKED ON THE DRESSING ROOM
BEFORE IT FLOATED AWAY."

08:02.440 --> 08:06.069
AND I'D SAY "IT'S NOT
DRIFTING OFF TO SEA, FANNY.
IT'S JUST VERY VERY WET."

08:06.069 --> 08:08.655
"THAT'S FINE.
WE'LL JUST RENAME THE STUDIO

08:08.655 --> 08:11.366
THE ATLANTIS DANCE ACADEMY.
I'LL ORDER A SIGN."

08:11.366 --> 08:14.577
THAT'S VERY FUNNY, FANNY.
WHY DON'T YOU POST THAT
ON FACEBOOK?

08:14.577 --> 08:17.789
"MICHELLE, ISN'T THE WATER
RISING AS YOU PLAY OUT
THIS LITTLE BIT?"

08:17.789 --> 08:19.833
YES, IT IS, FANNY.
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.626
"THEN GO!"
I WILL!

08:21.626 --> 08:23.253
OH MY GOD.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.633
‐ ( beeps )
‐ OKAY.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.844
‐ Truly: <i>Sparkles.</i>
‐ THERE'S A FLOOD!

08:30.844 --> 08:33.179
A PIPE MUST HAVE BURST
OR WE HIT AN ICEBERG.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.557
THE CARPET IS SQUISHY
AND NOTHING I'M DOING
IS HELPING.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.684
<i>Paper towels are useless!</i>
<i>Useless!</i>

08:37.684 --> 08:39.936
( confused )
THIS IS SPARKLES.
WE DO DRESSES.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.646
<i>Truly, it's me, Michelle.</i>

08:41.646 --> 08:43.523
I'M AT THE DANCE STUDIO
AND IT'S LITERALLY

08:43.523 --> 08:45.817
RAINING IN THE GIRLS'
DRESSING ROOM. HELP ME!

08:45.817 --> 08:48.486
WELL, I KNOW THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN REACH FANNY RIGHT NOW.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.238
‐ <i>How do you know this?</i>
‐ HER TWITTER FEED

08:50.238 --> 08:52.532
SAYS SHE'S UNAVAILABLE
THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.326
‐ SINCE WHEN IS
FANNY ON TWITTER?
‐ SINCE @OJAIFLOYD805

08:55.326 --> 08:57.704
CONVINCED HER TO JOIN.
YOU REMEMBER, HE DID
YOUR FLOORS?

08:57.704 --> 09:00.331
‐ SO YOU'RE ON TWITTER NOW TOO?
‐ YEAH, I FOLLOW FANNY
AND FLOYD.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.792
‐ HAVE YOU CALLED
A PLUMBER?
‐ NO.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.545
‐ THEN CALL A PLUMBER.
‐ RIGHT! YES! A PLUMBER!

09:05.545 --> 09:08.173
‐ I'LL CALL A PLUMBER!
‐ LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.300
I'M PART OF THIS NOW.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.194
( cackles )

09:29.194 --> 09:31.362
‐ WHAT‐‐
‐ THIS IS FUN.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.073
FUN?
( stammers )

09:33.073 --> 09:35.450
YOU KNOW YOU'RE PUTTING HOLES
IN THE WALL, RIGHT?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.911
‐ OH YEAH.
YOU WANNA POKE ONE?
‐ TEMPTING, THANK YOU,

09:37.911 --> 09:41.498
BUT DON'T WE NEED THESE WALLS?
I MEAN, WALLS ARE IMPORTANT.
BUILDINGS ARE MADE OUT OF THEM.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.249
YOU ALREADY PUNCHED
THAT ONE HOLE.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.543
‐ THAT WAS LIKE THAT
WHEN I GOT HERE.
‐ SO WHAT'S A FEW MORE?

09:45.543 --> 09:47.587
'CAUSE I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
YOUR PLUMBING IS.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.214
AND THAT TAKES HOLES.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.135
AH!
I THINK I GOT
THE LAY OF THE LAND HERE.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.262
I GOTTA GET SOMETHING
OUT OF MY TRUCK.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.806
HEY LOOK.
I GOT A PLUMBER.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.391
HE'S THE ONE WHO
PUNCHED ALL THESE HOLES.
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.560
‐ DAVIS.
‐ TRULY.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.855
‐ HIM?
‐ WHO?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.525
‐ THE ONE‐EYED PLUMBER?
THAT'S WHO YOU HIRE?
‐ HE'S GOT ONE EYE?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.527
‐ HE'S WEARING AN EYE PATCH.
‐ I THOUGHT THAT WAS
FOR FASHION.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.612
‐ OH GOD.
‐ HIS CARD WAS
IN FANNY'S FILE.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.531
IT DIDN'T LIST
HOW MANY EYES HE HAD.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.658
‐ THAT MAN CANNOT
BE AROUND TOOLS.
‐ HE WAS SO NICE ON THE PHONE

10:16.658 --> 10:19.494
‐ AND HE QUOTED ME A LOW PRICE.
‐ THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY
PAYING FOR ONE EYE!

10:19.494 --> 10:21.246
‐ TRULY‐‐
‐ NO ONE IN TOWN HIRES
DAVIS FOR PLUMBING.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.456
THEY HIRE HIM
TO PICK UP PEOPLE'S MAIL
WHEN THEY'RE OUT OF TOWN

10:23.456 --> 10:25.625
AND TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THINGS.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.546
THAT'S OUR LITTLE JOKE
BECAUSE HE ONLY HAS ONE EYE
TO LOOK AT OUR THINGS WITH.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.172
‐ WHOA.
‐ FLOOD CITY.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.133
‐ LIKE FROM THE BIBLE.
‐ Melanie: <i>WHAT HAPPENED?</i>

10:33.133 --> 10:35.510
IT'S UNDER CONTROL, GIRLS.
THERE'S BEEN A LEAK,
I'VE HIRED A PLUMBER.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.178
‐ HALF A PLUMBER.
‐ YOU HIRED DAVIS?

10:37.178 --> 10:39.305
‐ NO ONE HIRES DAVIS.
‐ NOT FOR PLUMBING ANYWAY.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.890
WE USE HIM TO KEEP
AN EYE ON THINGS.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.477
LOOK, I'M GONNA NEED
YOU GUYS TO CHANGE

10:44.477 --> 10:46.521
‐ IN THE BOYS' ROOM
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
‐ EW.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.065
‐ NO WAY.
‐ HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
IN THE BOYS' DRESSING ROOM?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.276
YOU CAN
LITERALLY SEE THE AIR.
AND THE TOILETS?

10:51.276 --> 10:53.903
THEY HIT THEIR MARKS
ON THE DANCE FLOOR,
BUT THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.780
FINE.
CHANGE AT MY PLACE.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.491
‐ MY HOUSE IS YOUR HOUSE.
‐ COOL.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.119
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT RIGHT NOW YOUR HOUSE
IS PRETTY DIRTY.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.288
DON'T JUDGE YOURSELF THOUGH.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY BUSY

11:03.288 --> 11:05.665
TEACHING FANNY'S CLASSES
ALL WEEK AND STUFF PILES UP.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.418
‐ IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER THAN
THE BOYS' DRESSING ROOM.
‐ ANYTHING IS.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.504
LOOK, IT'LL BE FINE.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF DAVIS.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.590
‐ HE JUST NEEDS
A LOT OF SUPERVISION.
‐ OKAY. THANKS.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.466
I'VE GOT TO GET DOWNSTAIRS.
I'VE GOT MY POP‐LOCKING

11:15.466 --> 11:18.094
STREET‐VOGUING
HIPPETY‐HOPPITY MACARENA
JUMP CLASS IN FIVE MINUTES.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.683
‐ ARE WE GOING IN?
‐ I FEEL WEIRD.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.269
‐ SHE TOLD US TO, BOO.
‐ OKAY.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.522
BUT WE NEED TO BE
RESPECTFUL OF THIS PLACE.
AFTER ALL‐‐ HEY!

11:31.900 --> 11:35.278
THIS IS IT?
36 YEARS OLD AND THIS IS ALL
SHE HAS TO SHOW FOR IT?

11:35.278 --> 11:37.906
COOL BED. OOPS.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.074
‐ SHE'S GOT BACK ISSUES.
‐ GET OFF OF THERE.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.702
SHE'S GOT NOTHING
IN HERE BUT GINGER ALE
AND MOISTURIZER.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.704
Girl:
<i>GINNY, COME LOOK</i>
<i>AT THIS. WOW.</i>

11:44.704 --> 11:46.706
SHE WAS A BLONDE.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.958
OH, THAT DOES NOT
WORK FOR HER AT ALL.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.253
THIS IS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY.
THERE ARE LAWS AGAINST THIS.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.215
WOW, SHE HAS TOURED EVERYWHERE.
SHE WAS IN "OKLAHOMA"

11:55.215 --> 11:57.508
‐ IN OKLAHOMA.
‐ HUH, BIG FEET.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.720
‐ HER BOOBS, HOWEVER‐‐
‐ WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.847
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF
SOMEBODY CAME TO YOUR HOUSE

12:02.847 --> 12:04.724
AND CALLED YOUR FEET BIG
AND YOUR BOOBS SMALL?

12:04.724 --> 12:07.769
BOY, SHE'S SURE GOT
A LOT OF JUNK ON HERE.
WHO'S ROD STEWART?

12:07.769 --> 12:10.188
YOU BREAK INTO A HOUSE
AND YOU DON'T THINK
TO INVITE ME?

12:10.188 --> 12:11.606
‐ SASHA!
‐ FINALLY!

12:11.606 --> 12:13.566
HUH, A BATHTUB
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM‐‐

12:13.566 --> 12:16.569
‐ HOW VERY MID‐CENTURY SHTETL.
‐ WE THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN MILITARY SCHOOL.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.030
‐ NO, WE DIDN'T. WE JUST
THOUGHT YOU GOT BUSTED.
‐ FOR WHAT?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.990
‐ FOR WHAT?
‐ FOR THE CAR THING?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.993
THE SNEAKING OUT THING,
THE JUST GENERALLY
BEING YOU THING.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.330
NOPE, NOT BUSTED.
IN FACT THEY TOOK ME TO A SPA

12:27.330 --> 12:29.749
‐ AND...
‐ WHAT?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.001
‐ NEXT SHOPPING SPREE
IS ON ME.
‐ NO WAY.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.295
THEY GAVE YOU
A CREDIT CARD
FOR BEING A JERK?

12:34.295 --> 12:37.674
IT'S ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR EMERGENCIES, BUT THESE DAYS
WHAT ISN'T AN EMERGENCY?

12:37.674 --> 12:40.385
WHAT WITH GLOBAL WARMING
AND THE WORLD COMING
TO AN END AND ALL,

12:40.385 --> 12:42.804
EVERYTHING'S FAIRLY DIRE.
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

12:42.804 --> 12:45.098
THERE'S A LEAK
IN THE DRESSING ROOM
SO MICHELLE TOLD US

12:45.098 --> 12:47.725
‐ TO GET READY FOR CLASS HERE.
‐ AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH
HER STUFF.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.644
WE ARE NOT
GOING THROUGH HER STUFF!

12:49.644 --> 12:51.437
OKAY, LET'S GO
THROUGH HER STUFF.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.314
Girl:
<i>OOH, WHAT'S THIS?</i>

12:57.819 --> 13:00.321
‐ Girl #2: <i>LOOK AT</i>
<i>ALL THIS JEWELRY.</i>
‐ <i>OH MY GOODNESS.</i>

13:00.321 --> 13:01.864
HUH, A FILTHY DOLL.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.828
NICE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED HERE?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.621
‐ Ginny: <i>OUCH.</i>
‐ Melanie: <i>THAT'S A STORY.</i>

13:08.621 --> 13:10.623
‐ Boo: <i>IT GOT RIPPED.</i>
‐ IN TWO.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.459
‐ LIKE IN A PSYCHOTIC RAGE.
‐ MAYBE SHE HAD A BREAKDOWN.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.629
YEAH. THAT EXPLAINS
HOW SHE LOST EVERYTHING
AND WOUND UP LIVING HERE.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.757
‐ I THINK THIS PLACE IS COOL.
‐ BUT IF SHE HAD
A PSYCHOTIC BREAK

13:19.757 --> 13:22.635
THAT INVOLVED A DOLL,
THEN WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN
A LONG TIME AGO?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.762
‐ YEAH, SO?
‐ SO IS SHE STILL BROKEN?

13:24.762 --> 13:27.849
‐ MAYBE SHE'S ON MEDS.
‐ Melanie: <i>OR MAYBE SHE'S ONE OF</i>
<i>THOSE FUNCTIONING CRAZY PEOPLE</i>

13:27.849 --> 13:29.934
THAT'S NORMAL IN THE DAY
AND THEN TALKS TO DOLLS
AT NIGHT.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.979
THAT WOULD MAKE HER
MUCH MORE INTERESTING,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.732
HUH.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.192
ONE WORD: OUCH.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.074
NOW REMEMBER,
IT'S A LONG REACH OUT
ON THE <i>PENCHE,</i>

13:45.074 --> 13:47.285
AS IF THE FOOT AND THE HAND
ARE CONNECTED.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.121
ONE GOES DOWN,
THE OTHER GOES UP.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.790
RIGHT?

13:52.790 --> 13:55.752
OKAY AND HIT!

13:55.752 --> 13:57.920
FROM THE TOP.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.923
‐ <i>( ballad playing )</i>
‐ <i>( tools banging )</i>

14:00.923 --> 14:04.761
‐ <i>( Davis and Truly arguing )</i>
‐ HEY!

14:04.761 --> 14:07.889
‐ <i>I MAY ONLY HAVE ONE EYE,</i>
<i>BUT I'VE GOT TWO EARS.</i>
‐ <i>THEN QUIT THE BANGING.</i>

14:07.889 --> 14:10.058
HEY!
SORRY, HOLD ON.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.393
‐ <i>( music stops )</i>
‐ Truly: <i>WHY ARE YOU</i>
<i>MAKING SUCH A MESS?</i>

14:12.393 --> 14:13.895
‐ OY!
‐ TOO LOUD?

14:13.895 --> 14:15.730
‐ TOO LOUD.
‐ SORRY.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.024
I TOLD YOU IT WAS TOO LOUD,
YOU FREAKING MISSING LINK!

14:18.024 --> 14:20.735
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
AGAIN, FROM THE TOP.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.948
<i>( vocalizing )</i>
<i>♪ OOOH, DESIRE... ♪</i>

14:34.791 --> 14:38.961

<i>( applause )</i>

14:59.232 --> 15:01.567
EXCELLENT!
REALLY GREAT.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.903
YOU!
GIRL WITH THE BIG EARS,

15:03.903 --> 15:08.282
AT FIRST GLANCE,
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE
A SPECK OF GRACE IN YOU,

15:08.282 --> 15:11.035
BUT YOU DO.
SERIOUSLY.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.831
GAZELLES!
ALL OF YOU‐‐ GAZELLES!

15:14.831 --> 15:16.791
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
‐ DID YOU SEE THE‐‐

15:16.791 --> 15:19.210
THIS IS NOT THE BELASCO!
YOU ARE NOT HERE TO WATCH
"GUYS AND DOLLS"!

15:19.210 --> 15:21.420
‐ I KNOW THAT.
‐ GET BACK IN THE ROOM.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.967
I CAN'T STAND
"GUYS AND DOLLS."

15:27.426 --> 15:29.220
RUN.
SAVE YOURSELVES.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.430
( laughter )

15:31.430 --> 15:35.143
‐ BOO, DID YOU
SEE HER WATCHING?
‐ SO WEIRD.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.436
‐ HOW'S IT GOING
UP HERE, KIDS?
‐ GREAT.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.813
‐ NOT SO.
‐ I'M DONE.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.857
‐ YOUR CAREER IS.
‐ WELL, EVERYTHING'S DONE.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.734
I CHANGED OUT
A BUNCH OF RUSTY PIPES,
REPLACED THE SHUT‐OFF VALVE.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.278
‐ IT'S ALL GOOD.
‐ WE'LL SEE.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.405
I STAND BY THE WORK.
IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.948
‐ THE GAMBINO FAMILY.
‐ HEY!

15:48.948 --> 15:50.950
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
50 YEARS AND RUNNING.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.870
I SAW THE PICTURE OF YOUR
GRANDFATHER ON THE TRUCK‐‐
NICE LOOKING MAN.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.581
‐ THAT'S MY <i>GRANDMOTHER.</i>
‐ OH, SORRY.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.916
WOMEN LOOKED DIFFERENT
BACK THEN.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.421
YOU CAN GET
THE DRYWALLERS
IN HERE ANYTIME.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.423
THANK YOU, DAVIS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:05.423 --> 16:10.261
‐ SO IT IS WITH A SENSE OF
SATISFACTION THAT I CAN SAY‐‐
‐ MILDEW.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.347
‐ WHAT?
‐ THE CARPETS. THEY TO BE DRIED
OR THEY'LL MILDEW.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.893
‐ IT'S DRYISH.
‐ NOT DRY ENOUGH.
YOU NEED FANS.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.394
‐ FANS?
‐ OR ELSE THE MILDEW
WILL COME.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.813
AND ONCE MILDEW COMES,
IT NEVER LEAVES.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.566
‐ ALL RIGHT.
‐ I'D HELP, BUT I HAVE
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.318
IT'S OKAY.
THANKS, TRULY.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.952
( dryer whirring )

16:42.126 --> 16:45.504
‐ THIS IS A SAD SIGHT.
‐ IT'S THE MILDEW.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.924
I HAVE TO STOP THE MILDEW!

16:47.924 --> 16:50.468
WE JUST CAME UP HERE
TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE OKAY.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.470
‐ ( dryer clicks off )
‐ I'M AS OKAY AS I LOOK.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.598
‐ DO YOU NEED HELP?
‐ I'M ALREADY HELPING.
SHE'S USING MY BLOW‐DRYER.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.975
‐ I'M FINE.
‐ Melanie: <i>WE CAN'T</i>
<i>LEAVE YOU HERE LIKE THIS.</i>

16:57.975 --> 17:00.645
WHAT IF YOU ELECTROCUTE
YOURSELF? THEY WOULDN'T FIND
YOUR BODY FOR HOURS.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.897
NOT TRUE.
I GOT MY JAZZY G‐SLIDING
BOOGIE WOOGIE

17:02.897 --> 17:05.775
BARN DANCING
HULA CLASS IN FIVE MINUTES.
THOSE KIDS'LL FIND ME.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.778
‐ LET'S HELP.
‐ NO, YOU SHOULDN'T,
I COULDN'T.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.029
PLEASE GET IN HERE.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.993
Charlie:
<i>MELANIE! PIG!</i>
<i>WHERE ARE YOU?</i>

17:15.993 --> 17:19.038
‐ IS THAT CHARLIE?
‐ YEAH. HE'S HERE
TO PICK ME UP.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.708
‐ WHAT, JERK?!
‐ <i>DON'T LEAVE ME WAITING.</i>
<i>MY TIME IS VALUABLE.</i>

17:22.708 --> 17:25.086
BITE ME.
THERE'S A FLOOD UP HERE
AND I'M HELPING.

17:25.086 --> 17:28.923
I CHANGED MY WHOLE SCHEDULE
TO COME PICK YOU UP.
I HAD THINGS TO DO.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.343
THE BOX OF TISSUES IN YOUR
BEDROOM WILL STILL BE THERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.428
‐ GO AWAY!
‐ YOU LOOK GROSS
FROM THIS ANGLE.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.973
‐ YOU LOOK GROSS
FROM EVERY ANGLE.
‐ ONLY TWO MORE DAYS

17:36.973 --> 17:40.810
LEFT OF THIS AND I'M FREE
OF CATERING TO YOU. ADIOS.

17:43.854 --> 17:48.276
‐ YOU HAVE MENTAL PROBLEMS.
‐ SO IN TWO DAYS HE WON'T HAVE
TO BE YOUR CHAUFFEUR ANYMORE?

17:48.276 --> 17:50.653
OH NO, HE WILL.
I FOUND A JOINT IN HIS ROOM.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.363
AND ONCE I SHOW IT
TO MY PARENTS,

17:52.363 --> 17:55.241
HE'S GOING TO BE
DRIVING MISS DAISY
FOR A LONG TIME.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.703
‐ I'M MISS DAISY.
‐ GOT IT.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.666
<i>( dryers whirring )</i>

18:07.420 --> 18:11.465
‐ HOW LONG HAVE WE
BEEN DOING THIS?
‐ THREE HOURS.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.593
LAST SEMESTER
WE READ "NO EXIT."

18:13.593 --> 18:15.553
I DIDN'T GET IT,
BUT I DO NOW.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.388
HOW DO WE KNOW
WHEN WE'RE DONE?

18:17.388 --> 18:20.057
WHEN THE CARPET'S DRY
AND NOTHING SMELLS LIKE MILDEW.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.852
‐ WHAT DOES MILDEW SMELL LIKE?
‐ IT SMELLS LIKE IT SOUNDS.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.855
YUCK. HOW IS IT THAT
HALF OF THIS ROOM SMELLS
LIKE RASPBERRIES

18:25.855 --> 18:27.898
AND THE OTHER HALF
SMELLS LIKE A GAS STATION?

18:27.898 --> 18:30.192
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN LIKE THAT.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.612
‐ SO WE'VE ACHIEVED STATUS QUO?
‐ WHICH MEANS WE'RE DONE?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.322
LADIES, THEY SAY
GO WITH YOUR GUT.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.407
AND MY GUT TELLS ME
WE ARE DONE.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.451
AND THAT IT'S HUNGRY.
ARE YOU GUYS HUNGRY?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.703
‐ UH‐HUH.
‐ WELL, I AM TAKING
MY FOUR HEROINES

18:40.703 --> 18:43.623
OUT FOR ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING THEY WANT.
HOW DOES THE OYSTER BAR SOUND?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.583
‐ INEVITABLE.
‐ IT'S THE ONLY PLACE OPEN.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.960
‐ I'M STARVING.
‐ I'M KIND OF HUNGRY TOO.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.130
‐ I DO LIKE THEIR ONION RINGS.
‐ GET ONION RINGS, GET BURGERS,

18:51.130 --> 18:54.091
HELL, IT'S LOBSTER NIGHT.
STUFF YOURSELVES WITH LOBSTER.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.302

MY SALAD, THANK YOU.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.746
NO ONE IS HAPPY WITH A SALAD.
THE LETTUCE JUST PUNCHED
ITSELF IN THE FACE.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.207
‐ UGH, I'M ALREADY STUFFED.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.459
YOU TELL HER ABOUT
WALKING ON SAND?

20:10.459 --> 20:12.420
OH YEAH, I FORGOT.
NO WALKING ON SAND.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.464
AND NO GOING IN THE OCEAN‐‐
IT'S JUST A GIANT FISH TOILET.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.801

20:18.801 --> 20:21.053
‐ BOO, YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
ON THE CLOCK, RIGHT?
‐ I KNOW.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.431

‐ YES, WHEN YOU ARE WORKING.

20:25.808 --> 20:28.269

ANY OTHER RULES
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT?

20:38.279 --> 20:40.448
YOU CAN'T BE LATE FOR CLASS.
LITERALLY NOT A SECOND.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.450
‐ AND THERE'S THE BOOB RULE.
‐ I'M SORRY, WHAT?

20:42.450 --> 20:44.410
WELL, IF YOU HAVE
A CERTAIN CUP SIZE...

20:44.410 --> 20:46.829
THEN YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE‐BRA,
AND IF THAT DOESN'T
HELP, TAPE.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.122

‐ I DO.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.677
MY BROTHER HAS A WALL
OF BOOBS IN HIS ROOM.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.721
A WHOLE WALL COVERED
WITH PICTURES OF BOOBS.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.599
THE FACES, NOT IMPORTANT,
THEY'RE COVERED UP BY BOOBS.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.310
‐ NOT ALL GUYS ARE
OBSESSED WITH BOOBS.
‐ SOME LIKE BUTTS.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.312

21:41.842 --> 21:43.469
NO, AND YOU'D
BETTER NOT TELL HER.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.721
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO CONVINCE ME.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.681
TWIST MY ARM.
( laughs )

21:49.099 --> 21:51.393

21:51.393 --> 21:53.729
‐ THAT'S OKAY.
‐ NO NO, I AM INTERRUPTING
A GIRL THING.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.273
I WILL TAKE MY MALENESS
OVER THERE TO THAT TABLE
AND READ.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.442
TAKE YOUR TIME. WHEN YOU'RE
DONE, I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.861
‐ YOU'RE NICE.
‐ THAT IS THE SCUTTLEBUTT.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.865
‐ WHO WAS THAT?
‐ THAT'S MY BOYFRIEND JOSH.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.700

GUY‐SINCE‐SECOND‐GRADE?‐
THAT'S‐WEIRD WEIRD.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.804
IT'S NOT WEIRD.
WE MET, WE CLICKED.
THAT WAS IT.

22:26.804 --> 22:29.348
SO, LIKE, WHAT?
DID YOU HAVE A TOTALLY
SLUTTY FIRST GRADE?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.517
CAMPED OUT BY THE BOYS' CUBBY,
WAITING FOR SOME ACTION?

22:31.517 --> 22:33.727
NO.
JOSH IS THE ONLY GUY
I HAVE EVER DATED.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.689
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.
REALLY, MY HAT'S OFF TO YOU.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.692
WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT
I WAS DOING WHEN I WAS 16‐‐
HOLY MOLEY.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.986
‐ WHAT? WHAT WERE YOU DOING?
‐ I WAS JUST WILD.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.864
‐ I DATED EVERYONE.
A NEW GUY EVERY NIGHT.
‐ Melanie: YOU'RE SERIOUS?

22:44.864 --> 22:47.783
‐ A NEW GUY EVERY NIGHT.
‐ <i>ONE GUY MIGHT'VE SNUCK IN</i>
<i>A SECOND TIME,</i>

22:47.783 --> 22:49.910
BUT HE HAD GONE PUNK
AND DYED HIS HAIR GREEN
SO I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.496
‐ COOL.
‐ OCCASIONALLY
I DATED IN SHIFTS.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.999
‐ SHIFTS?
‐ THE EARLY SHIFT
WAS 6:00 TO 9:00,

22:54.999 --> 22:56.959
THE LATE SHIFT
WAS 9:00 TO 12:00,
AND ONCE IN A WHILE,

22:56.959 --> 22:59.962
IF THE GUY LOOKED LIKE
CHRISTIAN SLATER, THERE WAS
A LITTLE MIDNIGHT MADNESS.

22:59.962 --> 23:04.466
<i>GOD, THOSE WERE</i>
<i>REALLY FUN DAYS,</i>
<i>WHEN EVERYTHING WAS NEW.</i>

23:04.466 --> 23:06.176
I LOVED DATING
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.929
HEY, I NEED SOMEONE TALL
TO GET A VAT OF PICKLES
OFF THE TOP SHELF.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.181
BOO, YOU DO NOT
HAVE TO DO THIS.
YOU ARE NOT WORKING,

23:11.181 --> 23:13.934
YOU ARE SITTING WITH FRIENDS.
HOLD YOUR GROUND.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.605
OH, YOU MEAN ME?
SORRY.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.609
<i>( vocalizing )</i>

23:38.792 --> 23:40.794
‐ HEY!
‐ ( gasps ) WHOA.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.339

‐ OH MY GOD.

23:43.339 --> 23:46.508
‐ DAVIS AND TRULY!
‐ GO, DAVIS, GO.

23:46.508 --> 23:49.053
PLEASE DON'T
MENTION THIS ON YELP.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.971
I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.685
UM, SO WHAT,
WAS THE ONE‐ARMED
YOGURT GUY UNAVAILABLE?

23:56.685 --> 23:58.896
‐ DON'T MAKE THIS WORSE.
‐ TRULY, THERE ARE TOE SHOES

23:58.896 --> 24:01.690
AND LITTLE
FLUFFY TUTUS IN HERE!
YOU CAN'T MAKE OUT HERE.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.234
‐ I WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT THE TUTUS.
‐ YOU HATE DAVIS.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.029
‐ DON'T YOU HATE DAVIS?
‐ I DON'T HATE DAVIS.
I JUST HATE HIS PLUMBING.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.698
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING.
IS IT THE PATCH?

24:09.698 --> 24:11.367
THE MYSTERY
OF WHAT'S UNDERNEATH?

24:11.367 --> 24:14.119
IT DIDN'T START OUT
AS A MAKE‐OUT SESSION.
HE SAID HE LEFT SOMETHING HERE,

24:14.119 --> 24:16.455
‐ I CAME OVER TO LET HIM IN.
‐ AND THEN YOU STARTED
TO LET HIM IN.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.124
I'M REALLY SORRY THAT
I GOT INVOLVED IN ALL THIS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

24:19.124 --> 24:22.878
AND IF ANY TUTUS WERE DAMAGED,
I WILL FIX THEM!

24:22.878 --> 24:25.172
IT'S WHAT I DO!
( sobbing )

24:27.967 --> 24:30.052
( water dripping )

24:34.682 --> 24:37.142
( trickling )

24:58.455 --> 25:00.582
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

25:23.272 --> 25:25.524
<i>( birds caw, flutter )</i>

25:25.524 --> 25:27.609
SORRY, BIRDS.

25:44.001 --> 25:46.628
‐ UM, HI?
‐ YOU NEED A NEW
AIR CONDITIONER.

25:46.628 --> 25:50.382
‐ THAT AND AN ALARM SYSTEM.
‐ SEE, I TOLD YOU WE
SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.885
‐ YOU SAID WE COULD
USE YOUR PLACE.
‐ TRUE DAT.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.678
AS A DRESSING ROOM.
WHEN WE HAVE CLASS.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.556
WAIT‐‐ DO WE HAVE
CLASS TODAY, BOO? HOW LONG
WAS I SLEEPING UP THERE?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.975
‐ NO, IT'S SATURDAY.
‐ AND I FELL ASLEEP ON FRIDAY,

25:59.975 --> 26:01.894
‐ SO I'M GOOD HERE.
‐ DID YOU SAY "TRUE DAT"?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.063
CUT ME SOME SLACK,
I HAD A BAD NIGHT.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.815
WHY DO YOU SLEEP
WITH A JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER
BY YOUR BED?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.817
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.779
SO SOME PRIVACY, GIRLS.
MAMA'S GOTTA CLEAN UP.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.614
IS THE DRESSING ROOM
FIXED YET?

26:13.614 --> 26:16.241
‐ IT'LL BE READY
FOR CLASS ON MONDAY.
‐ AFTER ALL THAT DRYING WE DID.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.994
I'M GONNA GET
A SECOND PLUMBER OUT HERE.
HE'S GONNA HAVE TWO EYES.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.704
‐ IT'LL BE GREAT.
‐ YOU'RE OUT OF DIET SODA.

26:20.704 --> 26:21.997
‐ I AM?
‐ WELL, YOU ARE NOW.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.999
( groans )

26:38.680 --> 26:41.141
ARE YOU SURE I CAN'T
BRING YOU ANYTHING?

26:41.141 --> 26:43.852
GOD, NO.
I'VE SPENT THREE DAYS
TRYING NOT TO THROW UP

26:43.852 --> 26:46.688
FROM THAT FREAKY FRIED FESTIVAL
WE HAD THE OTHER NIGHT.

26:46.688 --> 26:50.317
PARTIALLY BECAUSE I HATE
THROWING UP AND PARTIALLY
BECAUSE IF I DO THROW UP,

26:50.317 --> 26:52.528
I WANT TO DO IT
IN CHARLIE'S CAR.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.906
‐ I'LL BRING YOU
SOMETHING FIZZY.
‐ THANKS.

26:55.906 --> 26:59.284
‐ HEY, BOO, BRING FRIES!
‐ DON'T BOUNCE. I'M NAUSEOUS.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.703
‐ SORRY. FRIES WILL
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
‐ NO!

27:01.703 --> 27:02.996
OH, COME ON.
HAIR OF THE DOG.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.290
YOU'RE WAY TOO PERKY FOR ME
TO DEAL WITH TODAY.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.084
OKAY FINE.
WANT TO GO SHOPPING?

27:07.084 --> 27:09.086
‐ HOMEWORK‐‐ DARK AGES.
‐ OH.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.296
‐ HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN ON THAT PAGE?
‐ WHY?

27:11.296 --> 27:12.965
‐ COBWEBS.
‐ I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.093
‐ WANT MY NOTES?
‐ DO THEY HAVE HEARTS AND
SMILEY FACES ALL OVER THEM?

27:16.093 --> 27:18.804
‐ AFRAID SO.
‐ <i>GIVE 'EM.</i>

27:18.804 --> 27:20.305
‐ THERE YOU ARE.
‐ HERE I AM.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.974
‐ WHAT HAPPENED?
‐ WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:21.974 --> 27:25.018
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU FOREVER!
LITERALLY FOREVER!

27:25.018 --> 27:27.145
‐ SO DRAMATIC.
‐ GINNY, I'VE BEEN SITTING
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL SINCE 3:00.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.565
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ABDUCTED.
I WENT BY SIX LIQUOR STORES

27:29.565 --> 27:31.608
AND FORCIBLY VIEWED
THEIR SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.111
‐ I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING
TO WALK HERE WITH MELANIE.
‐ YOU DIDN'T WALK HERE WITH‐‐

27:34.111 --> 27:36.280
‐ YOU NEVER SAID THAT.
‐ I DID TOO, JOSH.
LISTEN FOR A CHANGE.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.824
GINNY, YOU NEVER SAID THAT
YOU WERE GOING TO WALK
HERE WITH MELANIE.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.200
I NEVER SAID
MEET ME OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.743
I ALWAYS MEET YOU OUTSIDE
OF SCHOOL ON MONDAYS.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.161
MONDAYS, THURSDAYS
AND EVERY OTHER FRIDAY

27:43.161 --> 27:45.247
WHEN I DON'T HAVE JAZZ BAND,
I MEET YOU OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.

27:45.247 --> 27:46.623
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.125
I'VE BEEN MEETING YOU
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL

27:48.125 --> 27:49.585
ON BASICALLY THAT SAME
SCHEDULE FOR EIGHT YEARS.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.295
ONE YEAR IT WAS TUESDAYS
INSTEAD OF MONDAYS

27:51.295 --> 27:53.088
WHEN I HAD
THAT EXTRA CREDIT
HORTICULTURE CLASS,

27:53.088 --> 27:54.631
BUT THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

27:54.631 --> 27:57.217
‐ I NEVER TOLD YOU I'D BE THERE!
‐ BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS THERE!

27:57.217 --> 28:00.178
AND HOW BORING IS THAT, HUH?
MONDAY, THURSDAY AND EVERY
OTHER FRIDAY?

28:00.178 --> 28:02.180
‐ I'M FALLING ASLEEP
JUST REPEATING IT.
‐ IT'S NOT BORING,

28:02.180 --> 28:04.933
‐ IT'S WHAT WE DO.
‐ I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.185
GINNY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

28:07.185 --> 28:09.563
I'M THE ONE WHO FORCED
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
TO FILE

28:09.563 --> 28:12.441
A MISSING PERSONS REPORT
AGAINST THEIR OWN POLICY!
GINNY!

28:12.441 --> 28:14.067
‐ WHAT'S GOING ON?
‐ I DON'T KNOW.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.986
‐ ARE THEY FIGHTING?
‐ I THINK THEY'RE FIGHTING.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.530
‐ THEY NEVER FIGHT.
‐ MAYBE HE FORGOT TO SET
THE D. V. R.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.699
THIS SEEMS BIGGER
THAN A D. V. R. FIGHT.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.659
GINNY, IF YOU DON'T
COME OUT HERE THEN‐‐

28:24.202 --> 28:26.371
OH MY GOD, HE FOLLOWED HER
INTO THE LADIES' ROOM?!

28:26.371 --> 28:29.124
THAT'S ILLEGAL.
AND JOSH WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.168
SOMETHING'S REALLY WRONG.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.837
CAN YOU HEAR
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
FROM THE MEN'S ROOM SIDE?

28:33.837 --> 28:35.380
LET'S GO SEE.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.514
HEY THERE,
FARMER JOHN.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.100
YA TENDING
TO YOUR GARDEN?

28:52.189 --> 28:54.149
WOW. THAT'S WEIRD.
IT SMELLS LIKE GARLIC.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.984
I HAD GIOVANNI'S
FOR LUNCH.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.195
AND IT'S PUTTING ME
IN THE MOOD
FOR SOME ITALIAN.

28:58.195 --> 29:01.448
IS GIOVANNI'S GOOD?
I'M ALWAYS ON THE HUNT
FOR A GOOD CALZONE.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.284
‐ I'M KIND OF BUSY HERE.
‐ I KNOW. LOOK, TRULY,

29:04.284 --> 29:06.787
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

29:06.787 --> 29:09.247
‐ I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SPOOK YOU LAST NIGHT.
‐ I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

29:09.247 --> 29:12.000
BUT I NEED TO APOLOGIZE.
I SHOULD'VE HANDLED IT
MORE DELICATELY.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.044
I WAS DRY HUMPING A PLUMBER
IN THE DANCE STUDIO.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.712
THERE'S NOTHING
DELICATE ABOUT THIS.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.589
AND THEN I MADE IT WORSE.
I COULD HAVE‐‐
( chuckles )

29:17.589 --> 29:19.257
WHAT?

29:19.257 --> 29:21.969
WHAT YOU JUST SAID‐‐
THAT WAS FUNNY.

29:21.969 --> 29:24.137
‐ SO YOU CAME BY
TO LAUGH AT ME?
‐ NO.

29:24.137 --> 29:27.182
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A TOUCH
OF COMEDY TO ALL THIS,
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.977
I MEAN, LAST NIGHT
I SPENT AN HOUR BEFORE
GOING TO SLEEP

29:29.977 --> 29:32.104
COMING UP WITH
ONE‐EYED PLUMBER JOKES,
AND THERE ARE TONS,

29:32.104 --> 29:35.315
BUT I MADE YOU FEEL BAD
AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
REALLY.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.651
FINE.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.112
DO YOU AT LEAST WANT
TO TELL ME ABOUT
PLUMBER GUY?

29:40.112 --> 29:42.823
WAS LAST NIGHT
TOTALLY SPONTANEOUS
OR IS THERE A HISTORY?

29:42.823 --> 29:45.117
‐ I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
‐ WHY?

29:45.117 --> 29:48.036
'CAUSE HE ONLY HAS ONE EYE?
'CAUSE OTHERWISE HE'S
PRETTY CUTE.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.746
I ONCE SLEPT WITH A GUY
WHO HAD A PEG LEG.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.790
HE WAS IN THE PIRATE SHOW
AT TREASURE ISLAND.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.417
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PROP.
IT WAS NOT A PROP.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.335
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE ONE‐EYE THING.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.296
GREAT. BECAUSE IT'S
GOOD TO GET OUT THERE,
GRAB A LITTLE SOMETHING.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.634
TRULY?

30:02.634 --> 30:05.137
I STILL LOVE HUBBELL.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.931
‐ BUT HE'S GONE.
‐ I KNOW.

30:07.931 --> 30:12.686
AND EVEN BEFORE HE WAS GONE,
HE WAS TAKEN.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.938
‐ I KNOW.
‐ SO HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO WAIT?

30:14.938 --> 30:17.107
ITALIAN WIDOWS WEAR BLACK
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.734
WOW.
SOUNDS SLIMMING.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.195
I FEEL LIKE I'M CHEATING.
IS THAT CRAZY?

30:22.195 --> 30:26.408
PUT THE SHARP SNIPPY THINGS
DOWN AND I'LL ANSWER.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.410
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.328
‐ DEFINITELY.
‐ MAYBE.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.330
DEFINITELY.

30:33.331 --> 30:35.292
SO ARE WE GOOD?

30:36.710 --> 30:38.295
YES.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.546
GOOD.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.467
‐ GO AHEAD.
‐ AH, YOU'RE STILL RAW.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.343
‐ IT'S FINE.
‐ WE'RE HAVING A MOMENT.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.887
‐ LAST CHANCE.
‐ OKAY, SO TELL ME.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.264
WHAT WAS IT LIKE STARING
LONGINGLY INTO DAVIS'S EYE?

30:49.264 --> 30:51.850
DID HE CLOSE HIS?
OH, YOU COULDN'T TELL
'CAUSE YOURS WERE CLOSED.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.852
WAS THERE DEPTH PERCEPTION
PROBLEMS?

30:53.852 --> 30:56.688
LIKE, WHEN HE WENT IN
TO KISS YOU, DID HE MISS?
I'M DYING TO KNOW HERE.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.191
Michelle:
<i>THIS ONE? NOPE. OKAY.</i>

30:59.191 --> 31:01.777
THIS ONE? NOPE.
NOTE TO SELF:

31:01.777 --> 31:05.363
GET YOUR OWN KEY
OR LOSE MIND IN THE PROCESS.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.074
IS THE DRESSING ROOM
UNDERWATER?

31:07.074 --> 31:08.700
NOPE, IT'S SAFE.
ALL DRY.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.827
‐ HEY.
‐ YEAH?

31:10.827 --> 31:14.206
‐ UH, CUTE SHIRT.
‐ OH, THIS? I JUST THREW IT ON.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.042
‐ YOU LIKE IT?
‐ I DO, I DO LIKE IT,
ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S MINE.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.294
‐ NO, IT'S NOT.
‐ SASHA, THAT IS MY SHIRT.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.713
‐ NO, IT'S NOT.
‐ THAT SHIRT WAS GIVEN
TO ME BY SIEGFRIED

31:21.713 --> 31:24.424
‐ THE NIGHT THEIR TIGER ATE ROY.
‐ I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

31:24.424 --> 31:27.052
‐ ABOUT THE TIGER EATING ROY
OR ABOUT YOU WEARING MY SHIRT?
‐ EITHER ONE.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.554
‐ DID YOU TAKE
THAT SHIRT FROM MY ROOM?
‐ <i>IT'S NOT YOUR SHIRT.</i>

31:29.554 --> 31:32.307
‐ IT HAS MY NAME IN IT.
‐ HOW SIXTH GRADE.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.476
DO YOU WRITE YOUR NAME
IN YOUR GLITTER THONGS TOO?

31:34.476 --> 31:36.561
HEY, DON'T GASLIGHT ME, LADY.
THAT IS MY SHIRT.

31:37.771 --> 31:39.815
FINE. YOU WANT IT?

31:39.815 --> 31:41.566
TAKE IT.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.944
DO I WANT IT?
WELL YEAH, I WANT IT
'CAUSE IT'S MINE.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.445
ENJOY.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.667
<i>( piano music playing )</i>

31:59.626 --> 32:01.336
ROTATE FROM THE HIP.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.298
EXTEND THE LEG.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.050
BOO, HAVE YOU STOPPED
BREATHING?

32:07.050 --> 32:08.969
YOU'RE GONNA PASS OUT
IF YOU STOP BREATHING.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.513
THERE YOU GO.
MORE FUN WITH OXYGEN, RIGHT?

32:18.979 --> 32:20.522
EYES FRONT, EVERYBODY.

32:22.399 --> 32:25.235
‐ BOO, YOU'RE NOT
BREATHING AGAIN.
‐ ( exhales )

32:36.288 --> 32:38.790
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE 15 MINUTES
LATE TO CLASS.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.959
THANKS, NARC.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.965
‐ HEY!
‐ <i>( music stops )</i>

32:46.965 --> 32:50.594
DRESSING ROOM.
NOW.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.024
WHAT'S WITH HER?
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:04.024 --> 33:05.442
I DON'T KNOW.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.658
‐ HEY, DID YOU
BREAK YOUR LEGS?
‐ WHAT?

33:13.658 --> 33:15.493
ARE THOSE PROSTHETICS
YOU HAD TO CARVE YOURSELF

33:15.493 --> 33:17.370
OUT OF AN OLD DINING‐ROOM SET?
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE LATE?

33:17.370 --> 33:18.914
‐ NO.
‐ THEN WHAT'S
YOUR DAMAGE, HEATHER?

33:18.914 --> 33:21.750
‐ WHAT?
‐ BOY, IF ANYONE SHOULD
KNOW THAT REFERENCE IT'S YOU.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.501
STREAM IT, DOWNLOAD IT,
WIKIPEDIA IT,

33:23.501 --> 33:26.504
GOOGLE "PEOPLE WHO STEAL
FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER."
GET TO KNOW THE REAL YOU.

33:26.504 --> 33:30.133
‐ WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?
‐ BECAUSE, WINONA, YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T EVEN BE

33:30.133 --> 33:32.469
A MINUTE LATE FOR CLASS.
FANNY'S RULE, NOT MINE.

33:32.469 --> 33:35.180
‐ FANNY'S NOT HERE.
‐ <i>MADAME</i> FANNY TO YOU.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.974
AND NO, SHE'S NOT HERE,
BUT HER CLASS IS, HER STUDIO IS,

33:37.974 --> 33:40.644
AND HER RULES SURE AS HELL ARE.
BUT YOU KNOW ALL THIS,
DON'T YOU?

33:40.644 --> 33:43.480
YOU KNOW THAT THIS KIND
OF BEHAVIOR WILL NOT FLY.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.982
I MEAN, FORGET WHATEVER BEEF
YOU THINK YOU HAVE WITH ME,

33:45.982 --> 33:48.652
BUT THERE ARE KIDS HERE
WHO WANT TO DANCE‐‐
FRIENDS OF YOURS.

33:48.652 --> 33:51.613
‐ I DON'T HAVE A BEEF WITH YOU.
‐ WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

33:51.613 --> 33:55.450
WHY ARE YOU
FORCING ME INTO THIS ROLE?
I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS PERSON,

33:55.450 --> 33:57.410
THIS AUTHORITY FIGURE.
IT'S NOT ME.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.996
AND NOW YOU'VE GOT ME
TALKING ABOUT RULES
AND YOUR BEHAVIOR,

33:59.996 --> 34:02.582
AND I LOOK STERN AND I THINK
I WAGGED MY FINGER.
DID I WAG MY FINGER?

34:02.582 --> 34:05.877
YOU MADE ME WAG MY FINGER!
I'M NOT A DISCIPLINARIAN.
I'M NOT A GROWN‐UP!

34:05.877 --> 34:07.504
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO BE!

34:07.504 --> 34:09.673
I'M NOT HERE TO TEACH YOU
ANYTHING‐‐ EXCEPT BALLET.

34:09.673 --> 34:11.967
I AM HERE
TO TEACH YOU BALLET.
SO YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES

34:11.967 --> 34:14.469
TO GET THAT HAIR IN A BUN
AND GET YOUR BUTT BACK
TO THE BARRE

34:14.469 --> 34:16.471
OR DON'T BOTHER
COMING BACK TO CLASS.
PERIOD!

34:18.473 --> 34:20.600
MADE ME SAY "PERIOD."
PUNK ASS KID.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.269
FIFTH POSITION.

34:26.690 --> 34:29.442
BATTEMENTS:
FRONT SIDE BACK,

34:29.442 --> 34:31.903
FRONT BACK FIFTH, REVERSE.
BOO, BREATHE.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.447
‐ LET'S GO.
‐ <i>( music playing )</i>

34:55.677 --> 34:57.679
‐ THANK YOU.
‐ <i>( music clicks off )</i>

34:57.679 --> 34:59.639
NICE WORK, PEOPLE.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.267
THERE MAY BE
HOPE FOR YOU YET.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.234
YO, ZIPPY.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.696
‐ DISTURBED MUCH?
‐ LET'S GO!

35:14.696 --> 35:16.448
‐ FINE.
‐ HEY!

35:16.448 --> 35:19.534
‐ SORRY. DUCK!
‐ I WISH YOU HAD
A FLESH‐EATING DISEASE.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.787
‐ I DO. IT PICKS ME UP
AND DROPS ME OFF EVERY DAY.
‐ LET'S GO.

35:22.787 --> 35:26.124
FIRST I HAVE TO GET MY STUFF
AND TALK TO EVERYONE
I KNOW FOR HOURS

35:26.124 --> 35:28.585
‐ UNTIL YOU SHRIVEL UP AND DIE.
‐ YOU COMING TOO?

35:28.585 --> 35:33.423
‐ YES, SHE'S COMING TOO.
‐ 'CAUSE SUDDENLY I'M WEARING
A CHAUFFEUR'S OUTFIT.

35:33.423 --> 35:34.674
FOR WHAT?!

35:36.259 --> 35:38.637
I'M HERE. IT'S THE RIGHT DAY
AND I'M HERE!

35:38.637 --> 35:40.764
YAY ME, RIGHT?!
AM I RIGHT?

35:40.764 --> 35:42.974
IS IT THE RIGHT DAY?
AM I WRONG?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.601
‐ CRAP!
‐ MOM.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.603
OH, YOU'RE HERE!
I'M RIGHT!

35:46.603 --> 35:48.813
YOU ARE RIGHT.
I JUST HAVE TO CHANGE
AND WE CAN GO.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.566
WELL HURRY, I LEFT YOUR BROTHER
AT EITHER THE CAR WASH
OR THE CLEANERS.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.777
EITHER WAY I WON'T HAVE
TO BATHE HIM TONIGHT.

35:53.777 --> 35:56.488
I'M ON TIME.
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.366
‐ HIGH FIVE!
‐ WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.868
‐ I KNOW, ON TIME!
‐ WHATEVER. WHERE ARE
MY AIR FRIES?

36:01.868 --> 36:04.579
YOU! REALLY?

36:04.579 --> 36:06.748
REALLY? WHY?

36:06.748 --> 36:10.460
‐ WHY? WHY?
‐ OH, WHAT I'D GIVE
FOR A SENTENCE.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.671
‐ SHE BROKE UP WITH HIM!
‐ WHO BROKE UP WITH‐‐

36:12.671 --> 36:15.423
‐ GINNY BROKE UP WITH JOSH!
‐ WHAT? WHY?

36:15.423 --> 36:17.717
‐ BECAUSE YOU TOLD HER TO!
‐ I DID NOT TELL HER TO.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.595
AFTER EIGHT YEARS SHE BREAKS UP
WITH THE PERFECT MAN!

36:20.595 --> 36:23.848
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW HARD THEY ARE TO COME BY!

36:23.848 --> 36:26.351
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
MOST OF THEM ARE SCUM

36:26.351 --> 36:29.104
AND THAT WHEN YOU GET ONE
WHO IS FAITHFUL

36:29.104 --> 36:31.690
AND GOOD TO YOU
AND YOUR MOTHER
THAT YOU KEEP HIM!

36:31.690 --> 36:34.442
‐ I'M SORRY. IS GINNY OKAY?
‐ NO, SHE'S NOT OKAY.

36:34.442 --> 36:37.862
‐ SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.
‐ I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.740
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO RAISE A CHILD ALONE‐‐

36:40.740 --> 36:42.951
<i>WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE</i>
<i>A SINGLE MOTHER,</i>

36:42.951 --> 36:44.744
<i>TO BE EXPECTED TO WORK</i>
<i>FULL‐TIME,</i>

36:44.744 --> 36:47.956
HOW TO KEEP A HOUSE TOGETHER,
TAKE OUT THE TRASH.

36:47.956 --> 36:51.584
HE WAS WONDERFUL.
HE WAS AROUND SINCE
SECOND GRADE.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.212
AND HE FIXED THINGS.
SHE WAS ALWAYS HAPPY

36:54.212 --> 36:56.923
AND MY TRASH WAS
ALWAYS TAKEN OUT.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.509
DIDN'T HAVE TO FIX
A WINDOW OR A DOOR

36:59.509 --> 37:02.137
AND HE HAD A LADDER.
I HAVE NO LADDER.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.140
YOU KNOW WHERE MY LADDER IS?
IT'S AT FAYE MENDELSON'S HOUSE!

37:05.140 --> 37:07.642
‐ MOM, STOP!
‐ AND IF I DIDN'T KNOW
FROM FACEBOOK

37:07.642 --> 37:11.438
THAT FANNY WAS COMING BACK
NEXT WEEK I WOULD PULL HER
OUT OF THIS SCHOOL.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.786
‐ YOU BROKE UP WITH JOSH?
‐ YEP.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.955
OH MY GOD!

37:33.752 --> 37:36.671
‐ ( knocks )
‐ I KNOW! I SUCK! I GET IT!

37:36.671 --> 37:38.965
IT'S NANETTE.
CAN I COME IN?

37:38.965 --> 37:42.802
‐ ARE YOU OKAY?
‐ I'M THE HARBINGER OF EVIL,
BUT OTHER THAN THAT‐‐

37:42.802 --> 37:46.139
YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO CLAIRE.
SHE'S UNSTABLE AND HER HAIR
NEVER MOVES.

37:46.139 --> 37:48.808
‐ I CAN'T DO THIS.
‐ CAN'T DO WHAT, HONEY?

37:48.808 --> 37:51.102
I CAN'T TEACH, RUN A STUDIO,
BE IN CHARGE OF THINGS.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.104
‐ SURE YOU CAN.
‐ THE STUDIO'S A MESS

37:53.104 --> 37:56.900
AND IT'S WET AND I DIDN'T
EVEN THINK TO CALL A PLUMBER.
HOW STUPID IS THAT?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.651
FANNY'S GOING TO BE
SO MAD WHEN SHE SEES IT.

37:58.651 --> 38:01.196
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
SHE'LL KNOW THAT.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.156
GRAPE JUICE?

38:03.156 --> 38:05.950
AND LIKE AN IDIOT
I TRIED TO BE FRIENDS
WITH THOSE GIRLS.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.578
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.
I MEAN, I'M 100 AND THEY'RE SIX

38:08.578 --> 38:10.955
AND NOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE THEIR TEACHER
AND TEACH THEM THINGS.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.208
AND YOU CAN'T TEACH THEM THINGS
IF YOU'RE THEIR FRIEND, I GUESS.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.502
‐ COOKIE?
‐ AND SASHA?

38:15.502 --> 38:17.253
UGH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH HER.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.631
I'M NOT A PSYCHIATRIST
OR ANYTHING, BUT I'D SAY

38:19.631 --> 38:22.842
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES
AT HOME THAT NEED TO BE
DEALT WITH PRONTO.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.970
‐ WOW.
‐ PUMPKIN CHOCOLATE CHIP.

38:25.970 --> 38:29.015
THIS IS THE BEST COOKIE
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.309
‐ SHE TOOK MY SHIRT, YOU KNOW.
‐ NO. REALLY?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.978
STOLE IT AND LIED
RIGHT TO MY FACE.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.232
‐ DO KIDS DO THAT?
LIE RIGHT TO YOUR FACE?
‐ OH YES, ALL THE TIME.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.151
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.029
I'M NOT HER MOTHER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE NEEDS.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.990
I'M NOT ANYBODY'S MOTHER.
I COULDN'T BE A MOTHER.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.536
MY MOTHER SUCKED.
SHE WAS LIKE A NON‐MOTHER.
I CALLED HER DEB.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.121
THAT WASN'T EVEN HER NAME.
THAT'S JUST WHAT I CALLED HER.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.750
THAT FEELS GOOD.

38:57.794 --> 39:00.046
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO
ANY OF THIS STUFF.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.632
I HAVEN'T HUNG OUT WITH KIDS
SINCE I WAS A KID.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.009
AND FRANKLY, I WASN'T EVEN
THAT GREAT WITH THEM THEN.

39:05.009 --> 39:08.096
I DON'T HAVE THAT
KID‐FRIENDLY GENE.
I'M ALL SHARP CORNERS

39:08.096 --> 39:11.558
‐ AND A POOL WITH NO COVER.
‐ YOU KNOW THOSE KIDS LOVE YOU.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.810
‐ THEY DO?
‐ BOO TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

39:13.810 --> 39:16.437
‐ YOU'RE A BIG STAR
IN MY HOUSE.
‐ REALLY?

39:19.315 --> 39:21.943
COULD I HAVE ANOTHER?

39:21.943 --> 39:25.029
EVER SINCE THE FIRST
NIGHT YOU CAME HERE,
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO BOO.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.823
SHE JUST WALKS
A LITTLE TALLER.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.242
THAT CERTAINLY ISN'T
BECAUSE OF ME.

39:29.242 --> 39:32.161
YOU ARE HAVING A MUCH
BIGGER INFLUENCE ON THESE
GIRLS THAN YOU THINK.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.247
<i>JUST HANG IN THERE.</i>

39:37.834 --> 39:40.169
I FORGOT HOW GOOD
GRAPE JUICE WAS.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.927
BOO!

39:47.927 --> 39:50.680
BOO, I WANNA
TALK TO YOU.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.766
SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU MEANT ME.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.351
WHAT OTHER BOO
IS THERE?

39:55.351 --> 39:57.979
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU
WERE SAYING, LIKE, "BOO!"

39:57.979 --> 40:01.399
LIKE YOU WERE TRYING TO SCARE
SOMEONE ON YOUR PHONE
OR SOMETHING.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.902
NO, I WANTED
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.321
‐ SURE.
‐ WHAT'S UP WITH GINNY?

40:06.321 --> 40:08.239
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT'S UP WITH HER?

40:08.239 --> 40:11.534
WASN'T SHE, LIKE,
MARRIED TO THAT JOSH GUY
SINCE KINDERGARTEN?

40:11.534 --> 40:13.870
IT WASN'T LEGAL
OR ANYTHING,

40:13.870 --> 40:17.165
ALTHOUGH HE DID GIVE HER
HIS GRANDMOTHER'S RING.

40:17.165 --> 40:20.001
‐ AND THEY'VE SPLIT NOW, RIGHT?
‐ LOOKS LIKE IT.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.545
‐ WHAT AN IDIOT.
‐ GINNY?

40:22.545 --> 40:25.298
JOSH.
'CAUSE GINNY'S HOT.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.550
YEAH, HOT.

40:27.550 --> 40:30.178
MEL'S PROBABLY
POISONED ME WITH HER,

40:30.178 --> 40:32.221
BUT CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?

40:32.221 --> 40:35.391
‐ TALK ME UP TO HER.
‐ SURE.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.061
‐ I COULD DO THAT.
‐ THANKS.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.188
YO, SHE‐DEVIL!
LET'S GO!

40:48.404 --> 40:51.074
‐ HEY.
‐ HI. WHERE'D YOUR MOM GO?

40:51.074 --> 40:53.826
SHE HAD TO TAKE A CALL.
SHE'S IN ESCROW ON SOMETHING.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.704
OH. WELL, UH...

40:56.704 --> 40:59.749
CHARLIE WAS
ASKING ABOUT YOU.

40:59.749 --> 41:01.960
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ASKING ABOUT ME?

41:01.960 --> 41:04.420
HE WAS ASKING ABOUT YOU‐‐

41:04.420 --> 41:08.883
‐ YOUR AVAILABILITY.
‐ MY AVAILABILITY?

41:08.883 --> 41:11.010
REALLY?
YOU MEAN, LIKE...?

41:11.010 --> 41:13.179
CHARLIE?

41:13.179 --> 41:17.767
OH MY GOD.
I NEVER THOUGHT
OF CHARLIE LIKE THAT.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.603
HE WAS ALWAYS JUST CHARLIE‐‐
STINKY CHARLIE.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.064
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT,

41:23.064 --> 41:25.066
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT,

41:25.066 --> 41:27.694
AND HE'S ALL
GROWN UP NOW, ISN'T HE?

41:27.694 --> 41:29.487
I MEAN, WOW.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.865
‐ HE WAS SERIOUS?
‐ SERIOUS AS A FUNERAL.

41:32.865 --> 41:36.244
I MEAN, NOT THAT
I'D GO OUT WITH HIM,

41:36.244 --> 41:40.039
BUT IT'S JUST NICE TO BE
THOUGHT OF LIKE THAT.

41:40.039 --> 41:43.876
IT'S WHAT MICHELLE SAID:
THERE'S THIS WHOLE WORLD
OF BOYS OUT THERE,

41:43.876 --> 41:46.170
AND I'VE BEEN STUCK
WITH JUST THE ONE.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.507
I WAS MARRIED
WHEN I SHOULD'VE
BEEN DATING AROUND,

41:49.507 --> 41:52.135
TESTING THE WATERS.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.053
I COULD GO OUT WITH CHARLIE,

41:54.053 --> 41:56.806
THEN OUT WITH FREDDY,
THEN OUT WITH EDDIE.

41:56.806 --> 41:59.517
I SHOULD MEET MORE BOYS
BECAUSE I MADE THOSE
LAST TWO UP,

41:59.517 --> 42:02.061
BUT THEY'RE OUT THERE.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.147
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S IT.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.733
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D PASS IT ALONG.

42:06.733 --> 42:09.277
‐ SO.
‐ YEAH, THANKS.

42:09.277 --> 42:11.904
‐ YEAH.
‐ SEE YA.

42:11.904 --> 42:13.156
SEE YA.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.999
‐ FEELING BETTER?
‐ A LOT.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.334
THANKS, NANETTE.
AND THANK YOU
FOR YOUR MAGIC PURSE.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.503
ANYTIME.

42:27.503 --> 42:29.630
BYE, BOO.

42:29.630 --> 42:31.674
