09:35.300 --> 09:36.580
and I had a dream last night

09:36.780 --> 09:38.580
of a talking wrecking ball,

09:38.780 --> 09:41.320
and it said I was going
to be late for the presentation,

09:41.520 --> 09:43.360
that I suck,
that nobody likes me, like...

09:45.540 --> 09:46.630
Grace DuBois.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.030
Oh, nice to meet you.

09:48.230 --> 09:49.720
You must leave there at once.
Come stay with me.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.330
- We have a guest room.
- I have a guest house!

09:51.530 --> 09:52.470
You do not.

09:52.670 --> 09:53.370
It's above the garage.
You've seen it.

09:54.890 --> 09:55.990
It sounds lovely, but I--

09:56.190 --> 09:57.340
But there's no lock
strong enough

09:57.540 --> 09:58.210
to make you feel secure.

09:58.410 --> 10:01.040
It even has its own fridge--

10:01.240 --> 10:04.300
and a hot plate
if you are a tea drinker.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.260
[chuckling]

10:05.460 --> 10:06.740
I'm so sorry.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.350
They have me
on a bit of a schedule,

10:08.550 --> 10:10.090
but I hope to see you all
at the talk later.

10:10.290 --> 10:11.440
Yes, yes.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.490
I might make it.

10:12.690 --> 10:13.480
I have stuff to do.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.050
I hope you can come by.

10:18.610 --> 10:19.570
I probably won't be there.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.890
All right, well,
I'll just, I'll walk you out.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.010
Yeah.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.030
"Charming eagles
was a family trait.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.550
He didn't know how he did it,

10:33.750 --> 10:35.030
he just looked at them

10:35.230 --> 10:36.900
and thought about them
crashing into a cliff's face.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.470
The white-chested eagle,

10:39.670 --> 10:42.210
commanded by a mysterious force
it didn't understand,

10:42.410 --> 10:43.810
smashed itself."

10:47.340 --> 10:48.350
Interesting.

10:48.550 --> 10:49.570
Should I read more?

10:49.770 --> 10:50.990
[Hank] No, no.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.010
- Go ahead.
- Uh, okay, thanks.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.570
Um, yeah,
you're always escalating.

10:56.770 --> 10:58.270
I love that.

10:58.470 --> 10:59.620
That's a very rare thing,

10:59.820 --> 11:01.230
and it seems to come
very naturally to you.

11:01.430 --> 11:02.840
Yeah, yeah, it does.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.760
So we want
to enforce escalation,

11:06.960 --> 11:08.760
even on the line level.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.590
If the eagle has a white chest,

11:10.790 --> 11:13.290
we can assume the reader
already knows that, right?

11:13.480 --> 11:14.460
Cut.

11:14.660 --> 11:17.510
And if the force is mysterious,

11:17.710 --> 11:20.680
do we need to say
the eagle didn't understand?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.420
That's implied. Cut.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.990
You know, and a lot of this
is just habitual.

11:26.190 --> 11:27.550
Yeah, he's just saying
edit yourself.

11:29.380 --> 11:32.130
Yes, but if you want
to be excellent,

11:32.330 --> 11:34.960
you have to reject the habitual.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.180
That is where mediocrity lives,

11:36.380 --> 11:37.440
in the habitual.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.050
That is how
you will distinguish yourself

11:40.250 --> 11:41.440
from other writers

11:41.640 --> 11:43.650
and start to sound
more like you.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.010
Holy shit.

11:46.210 --> 11:48.100
Uh, yeah,
I kinda always knew

11:48.300 --> 11:49.500
there was
this whole other level,

11:49.690 --> 11:51.060
but just didn't know
how to get there

11:51.260 --> 11:52.240
because no one ever really

11:52.440 --> 11:53.720
taught me
how to do that before, but--

11:53.920 --> 11:55.330
Okay, that's enough.

11:55.530 --> 11:56.460
That's good from you...

11:56.660 --> 11:57.590
We do have other...

11:57.790 --> 11:59.510
You know,
we're almost out of time.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.120
I have plenty of time, actually.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.680
Well, we're running
out of time.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.030
Are you sure?
I thought you said we had--

12:05.230 --> 12:06.120
Yeah, my watch--

12:06.320 --> 12:07.300
I don't know if you--

12:07.500 --> 12:07.980
It's earlier
than you said it would be.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.810
I'd like a word, Paul.

12:12.810 --> 12:14.260
Paul.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.470
You don't have to say my name
every time you talk to me.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.350
I've spoken to you
about the loudness of your car--

12:19.550 --> 12:20.660
There's nothing wrong
with my car.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.440
- -before--
and nothing has changed.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.840
Or ever will change.

12:25.030 --> 12:26.100
It disrupts my class.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.320
Huh.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.830
Not more than your teaching.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.630
How did you get like this?

12:34.830 --> 12:37.530
What mis-turn did you take?

12:38.840 --> 12:42.200
I am allowed to drive
the car that I want.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.420
I'm allowed to take care of it,

12:44.620 --> 12:45.990
and it likes to be revved.

12:46.190 --> 12:47.470
It's good at it.

12:47.670 --> 12:48.730
What I don't understand

12:48.930 --> 12:50.250
is how anyone has come to think

12:50.450 --> 12:52.640
that they have the right
not to be impacted by others.

12:54.070 --> 12:55.430
How about that wrong turn?

12:55.630 --> 12:57.350
Basic consideration
wouldn't kill you.

12:57.550 --> 12:58.560
Well, it so happens

12:58.760 --> 13:00.220
that I am an at-risk individual

13:00.420 --> 13:02.440
with regards
to basic consideration.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.560
I can't risk it.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.960
"Paul..."

13:12.570 --> 13:14.010
"Paul..."

13:15.750 --> 13:16.660
[chuckles]

13:19.140 --> 13:20.580
Why'd you say that to George?

13:22.360 --> 13:23.240
Do you think he noticed?

13:23.440 --> 13:24.760
Yeah.

13:26.190 --> 13:27.200
Oh...

13:27.400 --> 13:28.900
I don't know why I do this.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.510
It's only people
I admire, you know.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.150
Rude stuff just comes out.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.380
Mm.

13:34.580 --> 13:35.380
You want some advice?

13:35.580 --> 13:36.990
From you, no?

13:37.190 --> 13:39.300
Ah! Sorry.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.380
I'm like a freight train
that can't stop with insults.

13:43.250 --> 13:46.910
[♪♪]

13:54.740 --> 13:56.610
Excuse me, is Myrna here?

13:57.740 --> 13:59.050
Myrna.

14:00.180 --> 14:02.280
Professor Du-Boise.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.460
Green Subaru Outback,
RBG bumper sticker.

14:05.660 --> 14:08.190
Green Outback,
RBG bumper sticker.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.640
If I remember correctly, Myrna,

14:11.840 --> 14:13.770
you...

14:13.970 --> 14:16.900
are a top-shelf tequila gal,

14:17.100 --> 14:18.110
am I right?

14:19.590 --> 14:20.650
Flannery O'Connor said,

14:20.850 --> 14:22.600
"If you live
till you're 10 years old,

14:22.800 --> 14:23.870
you'll have enough
to write about for a lifetime."

14:24.070 --> 14:25.300
Do you think that's true?

14:25.500 --> 14:26.480
Uh, I think it's true,

14:26.680 --> 14:28.000
but it would not be
a very good story.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.390
[laughing]

14:30.340 --> 14:31.920
Does art have to be so painful?

14:32.120 --> 14:33.220
I mean, do we all have
to end up

14:33.420 --> 14:34.570
like "van Goch"...

14:34.770 --> 14:35.700
with an ear missing?

14:35.900 --> 14:38.390
Uh, it's van Gogh in this room.

14:40.790 --> 14:43.060
So, Jack Kerouac wrote
"On the Road"

14:43.260 --> 14:46.230
on this long, continuous,
teletype scroll.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.840
What sort of paper
do you write on?

14:55.930 --> 14:56.940
Uh...

14:57.140 --> 14:58.280
I just use a computer.

15:01.940 --> 15:03.680
Well, I guess we have time
for one last question.

15:05.290 --> 15:06.260
Yep.

15:06.460 --> 15:08.300
Yeah, Mr. Saunders,

15:08.500 --> 15:12.130
if there was one piece of advice
that stood out above others

15:12.330 --> 15:14.220
to help us become the writers
that we want to be,

15:14.420 --> 15:15.740
what...

15:15.940 --> 15:17.010
what would it be?

15:17.210 --> 15:21.400
Well, I'd say
trust that your taste is good.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.930
Have that good taste
exert itself onto your prose.

15:25.130 --> 15:27.930
Then just write every day.

15:28.130 --> 15:29.190
Just write.

15:29.390 --> 15:31.760
Maybe that's my problem.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.760
I've been doing
the once-every-decade method.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.370
[laughing]

15:35.570 --> 15:36.980
No, actually,
thank you for that,

15:37.180 --> 15:38.380
'cause that's awesome.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.200
Even great writers get stuck.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.860
That's just part of it.

15:42.060 --> 15:43.420
I hate my first draft,

15:43.620 --> 15:44.510
but I love it

15:44.710 --> 15:46.340
because it leads
to my second draft

15:46.540 --> 15:47.910
and my third draft.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.390
It's all part
of the process.

15:49.590 --> 15:51.170
Hank?

15:51.370 --> 15:52.340
What keeps you from writing?

15:59.870 --> 16:01.230
Lunch.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.480
We have that lunch...

16:03.780 --> 16:05.490
- Oh, right.
- Lunch.

16:05.690 --> 16:06.800
Thank you so much.

16:07.000 --> 16:07.840
Thank you, guys.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.490
You're all amazing.

16:09.690 --> 16:10.970
So exciting.

16:15.230 --> 16:17.020
I think I learned more
in that one hour

16:17.220 --> 16:18.230
than I have all year.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.770
It's-- it's just
frustrating, you know?

16:21.970 --> 16:23.290
'Cause, like, now I know

16:23.490 --> 16:24.380
what it's like
to sit in a classroom

16:24.580 --> 16:26.420
with a great teacher who's--

16:26.620 --> 16:27.560
who's totally engaged,

16:27.760 --> 16:28.770
and, like, really--

16:28.970 --> 16:30.170
really trying with me,

16:30.370 --> 16:32.820
and, like, putting in effort
and listening and...

16:33.020 --> 16:34.170
and after
I've experienced that,

16:34.370 --> 16:35.820
it's like...

16:36.020 --> 16:37.480
I don't want to go back
to Devereaux's class.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.260
I don't want to go back
without you.

16:39.460 --> 16:40.870
Well, I'm going
to be going back, Lester.

16:41.070 --> 16:42.400
That's not my point.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.480
[Solange] Maybe if you spent
more time on your writing

16:43.680 --> 16:44.570
than fighting
with your teachers,

16:44.770 --> 16:45.780
your stories
wouldn't suck so bad.

16:47.260 --> 16:48.790
The fact that
you don't understand them

16:48.990 --> 16:50.490
just proves their value to me.

16:50.690 --> 16:52.230
I heard your family donated
a building to Notre Dame

16:52.430 --> 16:53.790
and you still didn't get in.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.370
Everyone's heard that story,
Solange, okay?

16:56.570 --> 16:57.370
It's boring.

16:57.570 --> 16:58.500
Just like your stories.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.010
Oh, next time,
I'll add necrophilia.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.070
"You'll know when
true excellence presents itself

17:05.270 --> 17:06.860
because the mediocre

17:07.060 --> 17:08.460
will be in confederacy
against that person."

17:10.110 --> 17:12.250
I'm paraphrasing
the Confederacy of Dunces

17:12.450 --> 17:14.520
to make a point
about excellence,

17:14.720 --> 17:18.560
something I think
we should all be entitled to,

17:18.760 --> 17:21.090
no matter who we are
or where we're from.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.520
Is this a club or something?

17:22.720 --> 17:23.570
I'm just trying
to eat my lunch.

17:23.770 --> 17:24.910
This is not a club.

17:26.740 --> 17:27.750
Maybe it is.

17:27.950 --> 17:29.650
You're right, maybe it is.

17:35.920 --> 17:36.920
That was interesting.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.320
It's a public space,

17:40.520 --> 17:41.590
I can be as interesting
as I want.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.140
I'm Ellen's roommate, Ava.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.590
Okay, Ellen's roommate, Ava.

17:47.790 --> 17:51.160
And, um, you went
to East Lake Country Day

17:51.360 --> 17:52.810
with my brother,
but he was a year younger.

17:53.010 --> 17:53.990
Brooks Noon?

17:54.190 --> 17:57.160
Uh, yeah, sure, Brooksy, yeah.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.160
- I'm Bartow.
- I know.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.300
So what do we do now?

18:07.560 --> 18:09.220
No, I'm certain
it was at Bread Loaf,

18:09.420 --> 18:10.880
and we went into town
to get dinner,

18:11.080 --> 18:12.270
and at the bar,

18:12.470 --> 18:14.710
Colum McCann was singing songs
with the locals--

18:14.910 --> 18:19.060
I'm sorry,
what was that back there?

18:19.260 --> 18:20.410
What?

18:20.610 --> 18:22.880
When you put me on the spot
about not writing.

18:24.450 --> 18:25.410
No...

18:25.610 --> 18:27.590
Wait, you brought it up,
so I...

18:27.790 --> 18:29.890
It just seemed
a little hostile.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.250
Hostile?

18:32.450 --> 18:33.510
I mean...

18:33.710 --> 18:34.380
Hank, maybe you're being
a little sensitive?

18:34.580 --> 18:35.770
I...

18:35.970 --> 18:38.250
I'm fine, just...

18:38.450 --> 18:40.170
Jacob Rose told me

18:40.370 --> 18:44.070
that you said that
this might be a problem here.

18:45.210 --> 18:46.430
What? No. No, I...

18:46.630 --> 18:47.960
no, that's not...

18:48.160 --> 18:49.090
I didn't want to impose on you.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.920
I didn't know
if you wanted to do it.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.220
I am thrilled to be here.

18:53.420 --> 18:54.440
I haven't seen you in 30 years,

18:54.640 --> 18:56.360
and I'm just...

18:56.560 --> 18:57.650
I'm really glad you're doing it.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.400
Okay.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.580
I'm... I'm excited, too.

19:02.780 --> 19:03.920
This-- this is going to be fun.

19:05.050 --> 19:08.930
What is this guy up to?

19:09.130 --> 19:10.850
I'm pretty sure
it's short-story writing.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.410
Yeah, well, he's acting
really weird.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.640
Oh, no, let's not add salmon

19:16.840 --> 19:18.680
because it's the only thing
that you like at Nora's.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.160
We're eating there tonight?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.470
Tomorrow night.
We are.

19:22.670 --> 19:23.680
Because...

19:25.380 --> 19:26.600
Because?

19:26.800 --> 19:28.130
Julie and Russell
want to have dinner with us

19:28.330 --> 19:31.830
because, in their words,
they have news.

19:32.030 --> 19:33.260
They have news?

19:33.460 --> 19:35.040
- They have news.
- That's code for...?

19:39.260 --> 19:40.710
[sighs]

19:40.900 --> 19:42.920
I missed the window.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.580
What window?

19:44.780 --> 19:46.140
The window.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.590
Young dependent grown,
before new dependent arrives.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.150
You know,
a distractionless window

19:54.350 --> 19:55.290
in which to write.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.240
Maybe just try the window

19:57.440 --> 19:59.450
between waking
and going to work.

20:00.890 --> 20:02.070
And you're happy about this?

20:02.270 --> 20:03.510
Mm.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.430
I'm adjusting to the idea,
with modification.

20:05.630 --> 20:07.300
I looked up
how to say "grandma"

20:07.500 --> 20:09.300
in every single language.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.640
Swahili is "Bibi",
which is pretty cute.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.570
I mean, I think
George just hit a nerve.

20:17.770 --> 20:19.270
Why you don't write?

20:19.470 --> 20:22.010
You ask me why I don't write?

20:22.210 --> 20:25.100
Hey, hey,
'cause I got two jobs, okay?

20:25.300 --> 20:27.400
I'm a teacher
and I run that department,

20:27.600 --> 20:29.930
and you know my co-workers
are pains in the ass, right?

20:30.130 --> 20:34.060
Also, I actively raised
our daughter with you, right?

20:34.260 --> 20:35.720
And now I'm going to be
a grandfather.

20:35.920 --> 20:36.940
Knowing Julie,

20:37.130 --> 20:38.630
that's going to be
a third full-time job.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.070
She's gonna want me there--

20:40.270 --> 20:41.640
You think they're gonna want
you to raise the baby?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.030
I've been waiting for this.
Stop it.

20:43.230 --> 20:44.600
You're spinning out of--
Just stop it.

20:44.790 --> 20:45.860
Stop exaggerating.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.510
- You do write.
- [phone ringing]

20:47.710 --> 20:48.380
You started something
a few weeks ago.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.770
Go write that.

20:49.970 --> 20:51.650
Hello.
Hi, Mr. Nerhand.

20:51.850 --> 20:52.940
Thank you
for getting back to me.

20:54.990 --> 20:58.120
[ <i>"Ready C'mon"</i>
by the Weejuns playing]

21:04.610 --> 21:06.040
[Meg] That table's reserved.

21:07.170 --> 21:08.180
For who?

21:08.380 --> 21:09.220
For guests.

21:11.830 --> 21:14.230
Don't you have an office
or something?

21:14.430 --> 21:15.630
Oh, yeah.

21:15.830 --> 21:18.280
My office is not for work.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.410
It's to gather with friends,

21:20.610 --> 21:22.020
where all my cares
and responsibilities

21:22.220 --> 21:23.060
can slip away.

21:31.720 --> 21:35.720
[♪♪]

21:39.730 --> 21:42.480
[Hank, thinking]
<i>Why is it to fun to draw a dick?</i>

21:42.680 --> 21:44.870
<i>I mean, am I wrong to think</i>
<i>we all like doing it?</i>

21:45.070 --> 21:46.470
<i>I know I do.</i>

21:50.610 --> 21:51.710
Yeah, you can come,

21:51.910 --> 21:55.660
just don't stuff
your pockets with cheese.

21:56.700 --> 21:58.320
Okay.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.150
[Hank, thinking] <i>Maybe because </i>
<i>there's no wrong way to do it.</i>

22:01.350 --> 22:03.280
<i>I mean, all dicks are different.</i>

22:03.480 --> 22:06.680
<i>That's how we should</i>
<i>identify each other.</i>

22:06.880 --> 22:08.290
<i>Forget face recognition.</i>

22:08.490 --> 22:10.720
<i>Unlock your phone</i>
<i>with your dick.</i>

22:10.920 --> 22:12.120
<i>I mean, you've already</i>
<i>got it in your pocket,</i>

22:12.320 --> 22:13.420
<i>so it's right there.</i>

22:13.620 --> 22:15.250
So...

22:15.450 --> 22:16.590
when's the last time
you saw him?

22:18.420 --> 22:19.680
This morning.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.480
He's obviously very featured
in my dissertation.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.830
He was?

22:28.030 --> 22:30.090
You jerk,
you didn't read it.

22:30.290 --> 22:31.220
I skimmed it.

22:31.420 --> 22:32.530
Fair enough, boss.

22:32.730 --> 22:34.040
I only skimmed your novel.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.490
[♪♪]

22:38.690 --> 22:39.700
[sighs]

22:47.840 --> 22:52.150
[♪♪]

23:01.980 --> 23:05.900
[♪♪]

23:19.260 --> 23:21.320
[Bartow]
In light of the conflict

23:21.520 --> 23:22.930
that I've been having
with Professor Devereaux,

23:23.130 --> 23:27.240
we want to form
the Excellence Committee.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.800
It's a group of students,
like us,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.070
that aim to both
celebrate excellence

23:31.270 --> 23:32.370
where we find it,

23:32.570 --> 23:35.590
and discourage everything
that is less than.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.550
Look, there's a process
for starting new clubs

23:37.750 --> 23:39.810
that usually does not
involve me in any way.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.380
I'm sure my assistant, Jill,

23:41.580 --> 23:43.690
could steer you all
in the right direction.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.250
I am the Dean of Faculty.

23:45.450 --> 23:46.470
Right, well,
this concerns the faculty,

23:46.670 --> 23:48.000
that's why we chose you.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.260
Some of the faculty

23:49.460 --> 23:50.390
are intentionally resisting
being better,

23:50.590 --> 23:52.390
and it's affecting
us as students.

23:52.590 --> 23:53.520
We want to create

23:53.720 --> 23:55.440
a system of incentives
and deterrents

23:55.640 --> 23:56.920
to hold them accountable.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.660
Bartow...

23:59.860 --> 24:01.360
I understand

24:01.560 --> 24:03.400
that it's difficult

24:03.600 --> 24:05.100
to move on

24:05.300 --> 24:07.410
from this incident that you had
with Professor Devereaux.

24:07.610 --> 24:08.670
No, it's not,
because I am past it.

24:08.870 --> 24:10.100
I'm over it.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.280
It's over.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.850
He's the one
who won't apologize to me.

24:13.050 --> 24:16.010
Needing an apology
is really not moving past it.

24:18.580 --> 24:20.850
If we had
the Excellence Committee,

24:21.050 --> 24:22.330
I wouldn't need the apology.

24:27.420 --> 24:30.340
I can give you a common room
twice a week for an hour,

24:30.540 --> 24:32.170
I'll buy the pizza,

24:32.370 --> 24:34.740
and you can have access
to the photocopy machine.

24:34.940 --> 24:35.820
Yes!

24:38.520 --> 24:39.690
Hey! What are you doing!

24:40.780 --> 24:41.740
Put her back down!

24:43.740 --> 24:44.870
Put her down!

24:47.440 --> 24:49.490
Hey, you! You!
Stop doing that!

24:49.690 --> 24:51.580
Get away from there!

24:51.780 --> 24:53.410
Do you know
how many professors had to die

24:53.610 --> 24:54.760
for me to get this spot?

24:54.960 --> 24:56.670
Four! Four professors!

24:56.870 --> 24:58.680
And two of them suffered!

24:58.870 --> 25:00.190
Here you go.

25:07.630 --> 25:08.640
I was thinking about

25:08.840 --> 25:11.430
the 92nd Street Y thing
that we did.

25:11.630 --> 25:12.950
Kinda jogged a memory.

25:13.150 --> 25:15.000
Oh, I loved that night.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.870
That was the first night
that I met your father,

25:18.070 --> 25:20.090
at the reception after.

25:20.290 --> 25:21.650
Yeah, we kept in touch
for years.

25:21.850 --> 25:22.790
We wrote letters.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.880
You did?

25:25.070 --> 25:28.840
Yeah. Yeah, it was
so illuminating and stimulating,

25:29.040 --> 25:30.620
and it pushed me.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.580
I don't think I'd be
the writer I am

25:32.780 --> 25:33.610
without his influence.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.700
Me neither.

25:38.790 --> 25:41.110
Where's Gracie?

25:41.310 --> 25:43.720
Gracie!
Are you here, Gracie?

25:43.920 --> 25:47.330
Or are you too chickenshit
to face me?

25:47.530 --> 25:49.980
I'm standing right here, Paul.

25:51.630 --> 25:53.550
You took my parking spot?

25:54.720 --> 25:55.990
[Gracie] I took nothing.

25:56.190 --> 25:58.040
You should have paid
your parking tickets.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.780
I am a tenured professor
of the English Department

26:00.980 --> 26:02.130
of Railton College.

26:02.330 --> 26:03.390
I deserve a parking spot

26:03.590 --> 26:04.830
and the freedom

26:05.030 --> 26:07.130
to rev my car's engine
whenever I see fit!

26:07.330 --> 26:08.180
[Gracie] Are you done, Paul?

26:08.380 --> 26:09.440
[Paul] Not even close.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.440
You have no right.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.480
You are a cruel, petty,
vindictive woman.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.660
I liked "Tenth of December".

26:29.670 --> 26:31.850
Come on, come on.

26:33.670 --> 26:35.900
[Hank, thinking]
<i>Maybe all my father's cheating</i>

26:36.100 --> 26:39.910
<i>was an attempt to ejaculate out</i>
<i>his kidney stones.</i>

26:40.110 --> 26:42.120
<i>It seems like</i>
<i>it's the same tube.</i>

26:43.900 --> 26:46.170
Phew, that was something.

26:46.370 --> 26:48.120
Oh, trust me,
that was nothing.

26:49.780 --> 26:51.210
[urinating]

26:54.300 --> 26:55.520
You know, I do write.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.190
To-do lists, grocery lists.

26:59.390 --> 27:01.360
Important texts.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.710
Yeah, very important.

27:02.910 --> 27:05.110
Meaningful.
Moving, even.

27:05.310 --> 27:06.980
I just haven't written
a second novel.

27:07.180 --> 27:08.400
[urinating]

27:12.060 --> 27:13.770
Look, Hank, I...

27:13.970 --> 27:15.200
I shouldn't have asked you
that question in class.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.200
That was--
that was stupid.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.380
Don't worry about it.

27:18.580 --> 27:20.290
No, actually, it's not okay.

27:20.490 --> 27:21.770
You know, I get into
this teacher mode,

27:21.970 --> 27:23.820
and I forget
that everyone's not my student,

27:24.020 --> 27:26.950
and I put you on the spot
in front of your class,

27:27.150 --> 27:28.080
and I am sorry.

27:29.510 --> 27:31.350
Thanks, I appreciate it.

27:31.550 --> 27:34.130
Yeah, I mean,
it's just writing, right?

27:35.610 --> 27:37.790
It's not like everyone
has to write their whole life.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.580
Harper Lee only wrote one book.

27:39.770 --> 27:41.610
Second one was just a draft.

27:43.180 --> 27:45.150
Man, I hope nobody publishes
my unfinished books

27:45.350 --> 27:46.890
down the road for a quick buck.

27:47.090 --> 27:48.620
Yeah, that would be the worst.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.630
I mean, maybe somebody
has said all they have to say.

27:53.830 --> 27:55.100
Big deal.

27:57.580 --> 27:59.290
Hey, Hank, this has been great.

27:59.490 --> 28:00.460
I really enjoyed
hanging out with you.

28:01.760 --> 28:02.760
Yeah.

28:04.590 --> 28:06.420
Hey, I'm looking forward
to tomorrow night.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.790
<i>How is 19th-century poetry</i>

28:17.990 --> 28:20.780
different than
21st-century poetry?

28:25.050 --> 28:26.490
It's difficult to really see

28:26.690 --> 28:30.190
without
a side-by-side comparison,

28:30.390 --> 28:32.190
so let's do that.

28:32.390 --> 28:34.190
Let's compare Walt Whitman

28:34.390 --> 28:36.680
to say, oh...

28:36.880 --> 28:39.070
Professor DuBois,

28:39.270 --> 28:41.900
our own poet in residence.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.640
On the left

28:43.840 --> 28:47.210
is Whitman's
"Song of the Open Road",

28:47.410 --> 28:49.340
and on the right

28:49.540 --> 28:53.640
is Gracie DuBois's
"Follow the Lilac Sheet".

28:54.900 --> 28:56.560
Now, let's start with
the titles themselves.

28:56.760 --> 29:01.350
"Song of the Open Road"...

29:01.550 --> 29:03.520
has a mythic quality to it,
does it not?

29:08.570 --> 29:09.880
[says meekly]
"Follow the Lilac Sheet".

29:10.080 --> 29:11.530
[class laughing]

29:14.010 --> 29:14.840
[says meekly]
"Follow the Lilac Sheet".

29:17.190 --> 29:21.070
All right, Whitman, one,
DuBois, zero.

29:21.270 --> 29:22.840
Go ahead.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.980
Wonderful!
I can see again.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.990
What is that?

29:30.190 --> 29:32.910
Is that a stain on your shirt?

29:33.110 --> 29:34.950
Honestly, Hank...

29:35.150 --> 29:37.740
you cannot teach classes
in stained shirts.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.220
It debases our profession.

29:40.420 --> 29:41.610
It's not a stain, Mom.

29:41.810 --> 29:43.740
It's a reminder
of a sauce that I loved once.

29:43.940 --> 29:44.740
Did you see this?

29:44.940 --> 29:45.880
Yeah.

29:46.070 --> 29:47.830
Your father's retirement
is big news.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.530
He's done
quite well for himself.

29:49.730 --> 29:51.140
You know, without you and I

29:51.340 --> 29:53.220
dragging him down
for the past 40 years.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.660
He always did have
extreme focus.

29:59.310 --> 30:00.790
Here it is.

30:02.530 --> 30:04.850
My first, and maybe last,
book review.

30:05.050 --> 30:06.330
That was
a very positive review,

30:06.530 --> 30:07.370
as I recall,

30:07.570 --> 30:09.940
though a tad poorly written.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.680
Too much plot summary
for my taste.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.120
They always do that

30:14.320 --> 30:16.560
when they can't form
a clear opinion on their own.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.040
I always wonder if I got
this positive review

30:19.240 --> 30:21.350
because Dad called in a favor.

30:21.540 --> 30:23.480
I find it hard to believe

30:23.680 --> 30:25.520
that a reviewer
would give a positive review

30:25.720 --> 30:26.690
without really meaning it.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.000
Unless they really loved
your father.

30:31.390 --> 30:33.090
And that reviewer
loved your father.

30:34.480 --> 30:35.920
I mean, really loved him.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.830
So, you're right,
can't be discounted.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.540
[Hank] Maybe the second novel's
the charm.

30:44.740 --> 30:45.930
Still working on it.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.630
[Mom] You made
family choices, dear.

30:57.290 --> 31:01.550
[♪♪]

31:06.120 --> 31:08.040
Family choices.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.300
Hey, Mom...

31:12.690 --> 31:14.310
I think Julie's pregnant.

31:14.510 --> 31:15.620
Really?

31:15.820 --> 31:16.620
- Oh!
- Yeah.

31:16.820 --> 31:17.650
Oh, my goodness.

31:19.050 --> 31:21.540
Oh! Goodness, hold on.

31:21.740 --> 31:24.320
It's not like she's going
to go into labor right now.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.440
You don't have to pack
for the hospital or anything.

31:28.750 --> 31:29.970
Here.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.460
This was given to me
by your grandmother

31:33.660 --> 31:34.900
when I was pregnant with you.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.380
It was given to her.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.280
I don't know how long
it's been in the family.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.760
And now it's for Julie.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.290
Why didn't you give it to Lily?

31:51.340 --> 31:52.610
You look...

31:52.810 --> 31:54.130
not unhappy.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.950
Yeah, I'm a smidge up
from neutral, so...

31:57.910 --> 31:58.960
- Hello!
- [Hank] Oh, hey.

32:00.090 --> 32:00.960
All right, babe.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.440
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.010
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:08.180 --> 32:09.360
Everybody good?

32:11.360 --> 32:14.370
- You look radiant.
- Oh, thank you, Dad.

32:14.570 --> 32:15.850
How are you guys doing today?
Did you have a good day?

32:16.050 --> 32:17.370
- Yeah, pretty good.
- Yeah. yeah.

32:17.570 --> 32:18.670
Great!

32:19.760 --> 32:20.900
Okay, okay,

32:21.100 --> 32:22.070
I bet you're wondering
what this is all about,

32:22.270 --> 32:23.160
what the news is.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.900
The thought
had crossed our minds.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.210
All right, but first,

32:26.410 --> 32:27.910
Russell has something
he wants to tell you.

32:28.110 --> 32:28.860
Yeah, um,

32:29.060 --> 32:30.300
so, as you both know,

32:30.500 --> 32:33.030
our yard has a flat area
before the hill starts.

32:34.470 --> 32:35.520
Yeah.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.650
Yeah, and as
you probably remember,

32:36.850 --> 32:39.440
my old roommate
installs swimming pools.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.270
I don't--
I don't remember that,

32:41.470 --> 32:42.360
but go on, go on.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.750
Yeah. Um...

32:43.950 --> 32:44.920
Show them the--
show them the thing.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.750
It's pre-fab.
He's got a company.

32:47.950 --> 32:49.410
You don't have to put
any money up front.

32:49.610 --> 32:50.490
It's actually
a really cool business model.

32:50.690 --> 32:52.370
You put five percent down,

32:52.570 --> 32:54.050
you pay the rest over time.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.850
Right? So the pools
start at 6,000,

32:59.050 --> 33:00.240
but the one we want is 10.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.770
You can go up to 15,
but we're only doing 10.

33:01.970 --> 33:03.200
Yeah.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.470
So, uh, five percent
of 10,000--

33:06.670 --> 33:08.250
- $500.
- Yeah!

33:08.450 --> 33:09.770
So who wouldn't want
a pool for $500?

33:09.970 --> 33:11.860
Could we just cut to the news?

33:12.060 --> 33:14.170
No, yeah, that's what
we're trying to tell you.

33:14.370 --> 33:15.550
- We're building a pool!
- We're building a pool.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.390
A baby pool?

33:20.590 --> 33:22.400
[Julie]
No, just a regular pool.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.090
[Russell] Um, but we're not
just building a pool.

33:24.290 --> 33:25.830
No, we have
a whole business model.

33:26.030 --> 33:27.400
And the business model
will pay for the pool.

33:27.600 --> 33:28.920
Okay, let me just
stop you there.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.400
No, listen, Dad,
let me just stop you there,

33:30.600 --> 33:31.880
'cause here's the best part.

33:32.080 --> 33:32.930
There's three groups
of people out there

33:33.130 --> 33:34.060
that can't communicate, right?

33:34.260 --> 33:35.320
Swim students,

33:35.520 --> 33:36.410
swim teachers,

33:36.610 --> 33:38.060
and people with pools.

33:38.260 --> 33:39.890
Our app connects
those three groups--

33:40.090 --> 33:41.280
for a percentage--

33:41.480 --> 33:43.630
and we get part of
the whole of that percentage.

33:47.370 --> 33:49.030
Hank, will you, um,

33:49.230 --> 33:51.250
run up to the bar
and get me a martini?

33:51.450 --> 33:52.200
And get one for yourself, too.

33:56.420 --> 33:57.380
Oh, I'll have a beer.

34:01.430 --> 34:02.600
Yeah.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.920
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.570
Can I get a martini

34:08.770 --> 34:10.530
and another martini

34:10.730 --> 34:11.740
and a shot,
while I'm waiting?

34:14.090 --> 34:15.580
And I guess, a beer.

34:15.780 --> 34:18.710
All right, just give me a sec
because I am down a bartender.

34:18.910 --> 34:20.270
Oh, yeah?
You're hiring?

34:21.450 --> 34:22.490
Yeah.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.160
Can he be an idiot?

34:26.350 --> 34:27.930
Sure.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.120
[Solange] <i>It was horrible!</i>
<i>He humiliated you--</i>

34:33.320 --> 34:34.690
in front of the whole class!

34:34.880 --> 34:36.210
That man is an effing monster.

34:36.410 --> 34:38.300
Now, now, Solange.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.560
We have to be tough.

34:39.760 --> 34:40.950
Tougher then they.

34:41.150 --> 34:44.040
We have to have
skins like rhinos

34:44.240 --> 34:46.220
and souls like children.

34:46.420 --> 34:49.090
What he does,
it's just not important.

34:49.290 --> 34:50.310
But in front of everyone--

34:50.510 --> 34:53.050
What is important is the work.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.170
The word.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.090
Okay.

35:05.790 --> 35:07.070
Okay, everyone,
let's settle down.

35:07.270 --> 35:08.890
Come on, come on.

35:09.090 --> 35:12.940
How come you always
drag out that old chair?

35:13.140 --> 35:14.720
It doesn't even look ergonomic.

35:16.460 --> 35:18.380
This chair...

35:18.580 --> 35:19.950
has a personal history.

35:20.150 --> 35:21.730
It was in my family growing up.

35:21.930 --> 35:23.380
It was part of
our dining-room collection.

35:24.510 --> 35:25.820
Um...

35:26.020 --> 35:27.740
my father,

35:27.940 --> 35:29.650
the lieutenant colonel,

35:29.850 --> 35:31.520
he always sat at the head.

35:32.910 --> 35:34.880
Now, no one else

35:35.080 --> 35:36.530
was permitted to sit

35:36.730 --> 35:38.100
until my father
entered the room,

35:38.300 --> 35:40.360
and my brothers,

35:40.560 --> 35:41.620
four of them,

35:41.820 --> 35:44.540
they would try
to elbow each other out

35:44.740 --> 35:47.110
for the chair
next to my father.

35:47.310 --> 35:48.180
But I had a different strategy.

35:49.660 --> 35:52.590
"Sir," I would say,

35:52.790 --> 35:53.550
when he entered the room,

35:53.750 --> 35:56.380
and he would acknowledge me,

35:56.580 --> 35:58.110
"I've written another poem."

35:59.110 --> 36:00.810
And he would say,

36:01.010 --> 36:02.020
"Please recite it for me."

36:04.200 --> 36:06.390
And then, for those moments,

36:06.590 --> 36:09.520
and...

36:09.720 --> 36:11.000
well, only those moments,

36:11.200 --> 36:14.130
which would last
for the duration of the poem,

36:14.330 --> 36:17.920
I would have
my father's undivided attention,

36:18.120 --> 36:20.660
and then he would nod,

36:20.860 --> 36:23.100
and he put me
in the seat next to him,

36:23.300 --> 36:24.180
which was this chair.

36:26.310 --> 36:28.150
Wow.

36:28.350 --> 36:30.050
That's messed up.

36:33.010 --> 36:34.270
What... what do you mean?

36:39.670 --> 36:41.160
Like shooting the bird

36:41.360 --> 36:42.290
perched on the end
of your rifle,

36:42.490 --> 36:43.590
but what hunter could resist?

36:44.720 --> 36:45.600
John Barth.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.290
This is so exciting.

36:48.590 --> 36:50.070
I just wish
you would have read him first.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.130
I'm just going
to introduce him,

36:53.330 --> 36:54.740
and when he starts yapping,

36:54.940 --> 36:56.040
I'm gonna lean over

36:56.240 --> 36:57.950
and quietly fart
in his direction.

36:58.990 --> 37:00.180
You're really wound up
right now,

37:00.380 --> 37:01.790
so you going to be able
to hold it together?

37:01.990 --> 37:03.530
I'm fine. Why-- Why--

37:03.730 --> 37:05.580
Why do they have to have
so many pictures of him?

37:05.770 --> 37:07.660
He's sitting right there.
He's wearing the same jacket.

37:07.860 --> 37:08.750
[Lily] That's
a slightly different jacket.

37:08.950 --> 37:09.620
[Hank]
It's not slightly different.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.060
It's not slightly different.

37:11.260 --> 37:12.500
Come on, honey.

37:12.690 --> 37:15.370
Don't ever let me sit under
three pictures of myself

37:15.570 --> 37:16.930
in my favorite stupid old coat.

37:17.130 --> 37:18.060
[plastic cup breaks]

37:19.450 --> 37:21.460
Okay. So now, I think
you have to get out of here.

37:21.660 --> 37:24.070
- What? No, I'm the moderator.
- Take that.

37:24.270 --> 37:25.330
I'm going to tell them
that you have GI issues

37:25.530 --> 37:26.470
and I'm going
to get Finny to do it.

37:26.670 --> 37:27.550
No! Finny can't do it!

37:27.750 --> 37:28.640
He's going to do
a beautiful job.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.080
You're a crazy man right now.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.860
Do you want another headline
in the newspaper?

37:33.060 --> 37:34.650
Okay. All right,
get Finny to do it.

37:34.850 --> 37:35.860
Get out of here.

37:37.030 --> 37:38.090
Where's he going?

37:38.290 --> 37:39.130
Just...

37:39.330 --> 37:40.180
you just have to trust me.

37:40.370 --> 37:41.830
This is better for everyone.

37:42.030 --> 37:42.860
Where's Finny?

37:45.950 --> 37:46.920
[crowd cheering]

37:47.120 --> 37:48.660
[Hank, thinking]
<i>Ah, field hockey.</i>

37:48.860 --> 37:50.360
<i>It's one of</i>
<i>my favorite distractions.</i>

37:50.560 --> 37:52.880
<i>I hope no one confuses</i>
<i>my presence here</i>

37:53.080 --> 37:54.540
<i>with school spirit,</i>

37:54.740 --> 37:56.840
<i>which I find pointless.</i>

37:57.040 --> 38:00.670
<i>There's so much wasted effort </i>
<i>that goes into manufactured pep.</i>

38:00.870 --> 38:01.850
<i>For what?</i>

38:02.050 --> 38:03.240
<i>It benefits no one,</i>

38:03.440 --> 38:05.290
<i>except, well,</i>
<i>maybe cheerleaders,</i>

38:05.490 --> 38:08.330
<i>who feel, you know,</i>
<i>less alone and stupid.</i>

38:08.530 --> 38:10.420
Hey, your talk over already?

38:10.620 --> 38:11.990
Nah, I just left.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.120
How can a moderator leave?

38:13.320 --> 38:15.650
- Where's Smith?
- Oh, ankle.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.560
She limped off the field.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.820
Yeah.

38:19.020 --> 38:22.000
I don't know
why I love this game so much.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.780
Yeah, I started smiling
when I came over the hill

38:23.980 --> 38:25.830
just at the sound
of the wood on the ball.

38:26.030 --> 38:29.430
It's just the hustle,
the elegance of a perfect pass.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.880
Still, I wish our school
had one other half-decent team.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.190
All our banners
are field hockey.

38:36.390 --> 38:37.280
It's a little sad.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.540
What?
She tripped her!

38:40.740 --> 38:41.930
Come on!
You gotta call that!

38:42.130 --> 38:43.100
Head in the game.

38:45.750 --> 38:46.840
Why'd you leave?

38:48.410 --> 38:51.680
Turns out,
George Saunders is an asshole.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.160
Oh, that's too bad.

38:53.360 --> 38:56.250
Yeah.
He plays with people.

38:56.450 --> 38:57.510
Meaning you?

38:57.710 --> 38:58.990
Well, he messes with
other writers' heads.

38:59.190 --> 39:00.340
It's demeaning.

39:00.540 --> 39:02.080
He demeans people.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.130
Meaning you?

39:03.330 --> 39:04.610
Yeah.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.780
Did you tell him that?

39:06.980 --> 39:07.910
No, I just walked out.

39:08.110 --> 39:09.180
You should've said something.

39:09.380 --> 39:10.340
People love to hear
when they're A-holes.

39:11.430 --> 39:12.520
Oh, good dig!

39:14.610 --> 39:18.310
[♪♪]

any abuse or trauma,

39:39.100 --> 39:39.990
that would be great,

39:40.190 --> 39:41.340

39:41.540 --> 39:43.340
about your real relationship
with your mother.

40:22.010 --> 40:23.250
We read it and we loved it,

40:23.450 --> 40:25.680
and we sent you
a bottle of wine with a note.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.200
Because I remember
shipping was a pain in the ass.

40:30.810 --> 40:31.770

presented that way,

41:58.940 --> 42:00.130
