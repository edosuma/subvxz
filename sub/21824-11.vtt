WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:02.961
Previously...

00:03.040 --> 00:04.280
Well,
you can't just kidnap me like this.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.970
You may be our only chance.
I must take it.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.201
They've taken Claire!

00:07.280 --> 00:10.762
Captain Leonard has promised
to deliver her safely to us in Jamaica.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.571
Someone on this ship
had recognised Jamie.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.000
I know who you are, mistress.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.688
They have your husband
on warrants for murder and high treason.

00:18.760 --> 00:19.807
Murder?

00:19.880 --> 00:22.770
Guess what we found
in a cask of créme de menthe.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.246
I do not relish the task,

00:25.320 --> 00:26.321
but I am duty-bound

00:26.400 --> 00:28.607
to report your husband's crimes
to the authorities in Jamaica.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.571
You have my blessing.
You can he married in Jamaica.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.524
My husband, he's going to be in trouble.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.364
I think they're going
to try and use me as bait.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.090
Water take you Cockburn.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.161
Jump.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.281
Jump?

00:40.440 --> 00:41.441
Now's the only chance.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.764
Jesus H Roosevelt Christ.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.969
I was relieved to find land.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.323
But as to what land
I'd found, I had no clue.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.205
It wasn't Grand Turk,
that much was cenain.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.727
It was far too big,
and I had floated far too long.

04:53.840 --> 04:59.085
And worse, I had no idea
where or how I would find Jamie.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.248
I remembered the rule of threes.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.446
Humans can survive
three minutes without air,

05:24.480 --> 05:28.883
three days without water,
and three weeks without food.

05:30.440 --> 05:34.604
Right now,
my most urgent need was water.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.729
I continued further inland,
hoping to find a road.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.563
A road meant civilisation
and a town at the end of it.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.247
Perhaps there was a port
on the other side of the Island

07:59.320 --> 08:01.527
where I could buy passage to Jamaica.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.011
Serve ye the Lord with gladness.

15:26.800 --> 15:31.089
Enter into His presence
with exceedingly great joy.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.243
Know ye that the Lord is God.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.241
It's no use.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.040
I tied you up.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.406
For your own good.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.641
Water.

16:56.560 --> 16:57.561
Please...

16:59.800 --> 17:00.801
Untie me.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.167
This was the only way to keep you from
scratching.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.165
You need to rest.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.400
I'll wash these.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.681
Splendid.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.964
Ludo, she is awake.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.482
Ludo found you
on the path the other day.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.962
He was gravely concerned
for your well-being.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.481
Where am I?

17:59.120 --> 18:00.281
An Englishwoman.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.201
What good fortune.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.690
I'm Father Fogden.
Your most obedient servant, Madam.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.524
Welcome to Hacienda de la Fuente.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.604
Please untie me.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.727
Of course.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.641
Mamacita thought it best
to keep you restrained

18:18.720 --> 18:21.041
to keep you
from scratching yourself raw.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.241
Allow me, my dear.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.481
Up-

18:41.760 --> 18:44.047
I thought you might
benefit from some nourishment.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.207
Thank you.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.045
Take care not to drink too quickly.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.641
I know.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.207
I'm a doctor.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.641
A woman?

19:02.760 --> 19:04.728
From the American colonies.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.160
It's more common there.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.085
Healer of the sick. Like Saint Brigid.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.685
I'm no saint.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.444
You'll pardon me if I don't believe you.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.808
It seems your powers
have bestowed us with our new arrival.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.287
Just this morning, one of my
she-goats gave birth successfully.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.203
First newborn we've had in a long while.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.605
How did you come to be here?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.169
Where exactly is here?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.602
The Island of Saint-Domingue.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.286
It's just to the east.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.846
My husband's travelling
to Jamaica and...

19:47.160 --> 19:48.400
I need to find him.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.641
There is a village.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.682
St-Louis-du-Nord
where there are fishing boats

19:52.760 --> 19:55.366
that might carry you to Cap-Haitian,
30 miles distance.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.250
How long does it take to get there?

19:58.320 --> 20:00.402
The village is a day's walk from here

20:00.960 --> 20:02.928
and to travel from there to Jamaica,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.367
no more than two days,
with a favourable wind.

20:06.440 --> 20:10.365
I might make it to Kingston in time,
if I leave tomorrow.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.930
Tomorrow. No, no, no, my dear.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.881
Coco says it is far too dangerous.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.051
Even for a lady as gifted as yourself.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.406
Thankfully, Coco just reminded me
that if you were to go overland,

20:27.480 --> 20:29.608
you might encounter maroons.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.401
Maroons?

20:33.480 --> 20:34.925
Escaped slaves.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.485
Having fled their masters,
they take refuge in the remote hills.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.846
They can be a rather unpredictable lot.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.840
Did you encounter any on your way here?

20:46.240 --> 20:47.241
No.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.361
And what of pirates?

20:50.240 --> 20:51.685
I didn't see any.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.331
Those unscrupulous ruffians
are a blight upon our isle,

20:54.440 --> 20:57.284
ransacking and plundering
whomsoever they might...

20:58.560 --> 20:59.721
Coco, mustn't stare!

21:00.160 --> 21:01.161
It's rude!

21:01.720 --> 21:03.131
My sincere apologies.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.962
Yes, she is a pretty lady.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.403
Not like my Ermenegilda.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.688
But pretty nonetheless.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.121
Mamacita?

21:17.800 --> 21:20.451
You will, no doubt,
require clean garments, will you not?

21:22.120 --> 21:23.406
I suppose I will.

21:27.040 --> 21:31.568
Have we something that
Madam Physician might wear?

21:32.120 --> 21:33.929
Ermenegilda's dress, perhaps?

21:37.040 --> 21:38.041
No.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.681
Too small for that cow.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.850
Give her your old robe,
if you must.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.286
You stink.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.885
It's time for you to wash.

22:03.720 --> 22:04.801
For you.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.282
Fried plantain
mixed with manioc and red beans.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.407
One of Mamacita's special dishes.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.281
It's very good.

24:14.360 --> 24:18.490
So, how was it
that you came to Saint-Domingue?

24:21.480 --> 24:25.041
Fifteen years ago,
I travelled to the island of Cuba

24:25.240 --> 24:26.765
to do the work of God,

24:27.480 --> 24:30.848
tending to the needs of the poor
and of those whose souls were in peril.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.411
Until I met her.

24:38.200 --> 24:41.329
Ermenegilda Ruiz Alcantara y Meroz.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.281
To my surprise,

24:44.560 --> 24:48.849
she longed for me
as I yearned to be with her.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.003
Our love could not be subdued.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.804
Must've been very complicated.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.811
You being a priest, falling in love.

24:59.880 --> 25:00.881
Quite right.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.691
Which is why we ran away.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.323
Far from the reach of Don Armando,
her cruel husband.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.249
A man of great wealth and influence.

25:09.760 --> 25:13.367
It was God's will that we
escaped Don Armando's grasp unscathed.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.521
HOW So?

25:17.360 --> 25:20.170
The English invaded Cuba
the very day we fled.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.124
It was impossible
for Don Armando to locate us

25:23.200 --> 25:24.281
amidst the chaos which ensued.

25:25.240 --> 25:28.926
I would like to think
it was my loyalty to the Crown

25:29.000 --> 25:30.684
which allowed for that stroke
of fortune.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.201
We rode to Bayamo

25:35.280 --> 25:38.329
and paid passage for a boat
which brought us safely here.

25:39.160 --> 25:44.610
But soon after our arrival,
my Ermenegilda became unwell and...

25:49.840 --> 25:51.126
May her soul rest in peace.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.526
I'm so sorry.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.570
May I offer you...

26:14.040 --> 26:15.405
Some yupa?

26:16.080 --> 26:17.411
It can make one feel quite...

26:18.520 --> 26:19.567
Euphoric.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.885
Quite all right, thank you.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.571
The village that you mentioned earlier,
how do I get there?

26:44.920 --> 26:46.524
I would like to leave tomorrow morning.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.441
Allow you to journey alone?
Good heavens.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.327
Coco and I could never forgive ourselves
if you were to do that.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.329
No, I shall accompany you.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.081
That's very kind.

27:00.880 --> 27:01.881
Next week.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.850
Next week?
I'm afraid I can't wait that long.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.843
You need your rest.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.446
What I need is to reach Jamaica.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.928
Although your spirits seem
much improved,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.924
you are not yet well enough
to undertake such a journey.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.726
Perhaps in two weeks' time...

27:19.800 --> 27:21.768
I am a doctor, for Christ's sake.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.729
I think I know
when I am fit to travel.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.723
Madam Physician, blasphemous language
is not permissible in my home.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.767
I fear that your irritability
is due to your fatigue.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.444
Travelling would only exacerbate
your already delicate condition.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.567
Let her go.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.369
We did our Catholic duty.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.407
That whore must go.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.761
What...

27:41.000 --> 27:42.968
She is welcome here.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.451
She has brought us good fortune.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.726
Why do you want to keep her?

27:46.720 --> 27:47.926
You wish her to become Ermenegilda?

27:48.400 --> 27:49.401
That jezebel...

27:49.840 --> 27:52.127
...could never replace my baby.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.362
I didn't say she would.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.449
But the goats have flourished
since she arrived..

27:56.520 --> 27:57.601
You are a fool!

27:57.680 --> 27:59.569
She must go!

27:59.640 --> 28:02.450
I've had enough of having
this woman in the house!

28:02.520 --> 28:03.681
Now, I'm the one that's in charge.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.844
I don't want to see her again.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.921
Is that clear?

28:07.120 --> 28:08.121
- It's clear.
- Shut up!

28:08.960 --> 28:10.291
Mamacita?

28:12.280 --> 28:14.806
I was detennined
to get to St-Louis-du-Nord

28:16.160 --> 28:18.481
with or without Father Fogden's help.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.281
I See

28:30.280 --> 28:32.123
you're struck by the sight of this.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.201
A most eye-catching garment.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.965
It was Ermenegilda's.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.810
It's a very beautiful dress.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.522
My apologies
for the quarrel you witnessed.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.520
You see, Ermenegilda was...

29:03.640 --> 29:05.324
Mamacita's only child.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.889
The agony
of losing a daughter haunts her still.

29:14.600 --> 29:15.647
I understand.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.049
So a visitor,
especially one of the fairer sex...

29:22.400 --> 29:25.131
Mamacita fears
that I will forget her daughter.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.448
Which, of course, I could never do.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.726
When you love someone
as much as I loved Ermenegilda,

29:41.840 --> 29:43.205
it never leaves you.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.441
No.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.921
It doesn't.

29:51.680 --> 29:56.129
You have loved someone so much
that you would risk everything for them.

29:57.920 --> 29:58.921
My husband.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.447
If I don't make it to Jamaica...

30:06.120 --> 30:09.203
I could lose him forever.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.566
Then you must be reunited with him.

30:19.480 --> 30:23.280
Then perhaps we could leave
for St-Louis-du-Nord tomorrow morning?

30:24.160 --> 30:25.207
What a wonderful notion.

30:28.240 --> 30:32.040
I will consult with Coco in the morning.
He will know if the time is right.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.208
My clothes had been washed and mended.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.841
Clearly, Mamacita wanted me to go.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.530
But I still needed
to convince Father Fogden.

31:34.240 --> 31:38.370
Yes, I'm feeling much better.
Thank you for asking.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.650
Well, I will be very careful

31:41.160 --> 31:45.006
and Father Fogden
will take very good care of me, as well.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.081
Good morning.

31:49.600 --> 31:53.571
Coco was just telling me that
today's a good day to go to the village.

31:53.920 --> 31:54.921
Father!

31:55.280 --> 31:56.281
Father!

31:56.480 --> 31:57.481
Oh my God!

31:58.000 --> 31:59.001
Father!

31:59.360 --> 32:00.930
Father! Come quickly!

32:01.200 --> 32:02.326
What's the matter?

32:02.440 --> 32:04.044
A Chinese sailor killed Arabella!

32:04.720 --> 32:05.926
Roasted her on a spit.

32:06.440 --> 32:07.771
He ate her.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.041
Arabella.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.251
My poor Arabella.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.561
If our Lord cares
even for the tiny sparrow,

32:58.000 --> 33:01.402
how can he fail to care for my Arabella?

33:19.400 --> 33:20.845
Voracious little fellows.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.684
From a sacred cave called Abandawe.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.481
Abandawe will devour ye!

33:28.360 --> 33:31.603
Abandawe! Abandawe.

33:34.960 --> 33:35.961
Abandawe?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.648
It is hallowed
to the natives of Jamaica,

33:41.280 --> 33:42.850
a place of great power.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.243
It is said that folk disappear there.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.324
How could those wretched sailors
do this to my beloved Arabella?

33:54.760 --> 33:58.810
Kill her, roast her on a spit as though
she were some son of feral animal.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.121
To think of her...

34:01.640 --> 34:03.881
A feast for a Chinaman.

34:06.560 --> 34:07.607
A Chinaman?

34:07.680 --> 34:11.286
Yes. He murdered my Arabella.
Mamacita saw him.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.764
The ship he was on, was it nearby?
What else did she see?

34:16.280 --> 34:17.770
What else did you
see on the beach?

34:17.840 --> 34:20.411
Many sailors and broken sails
on the beach...

34:21.560 --> 34:24.643
Many sailors
and broken sails scattered on the sand.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.406
Where is the ship now?

34:27.120 --> 34:28.326
What does that matter?

34:28.840 --> 34:30.888
Those heathens ate my Arabella.

34:30.960 --> 34:34.646
And I am sorry for that,
but I need to know how to get there.

34:34.760 --> 34:36.364
Devils, the whole lot of them.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.440
How do I get to the ship?

34:37.520 --> 34:38.521
That way.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.882
Run. Now! To the right.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.163
Then keep going straight!
Straight ahead!

34:43.239 --> 34:45.129
Run! Yes, that way!

35:04.560 --> 35:07.564
The sea holds untold dangers.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.801
Aye, Milord.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.484
Those seen and unseen.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.927
Even knowledgeable mariners
must be wary of uncharted shoals.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.124
And those gales didn't help matters.

35:20.960 --> 35:25.682
'Tis lucky only the foremast fell.
The hull remains intact.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.562
There's naught to be done
for the men we lost, but...

35:35.840 --> 35:38.730
No shame in grieving for them.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.004
I do not grieve for them, Milord.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.284
There were times during our journey
I wished Captain Raines dead.

35:45.800 --> 35:46.801
Warren, too.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.606
Now they lie at the bottom
of the sea with Mr Murphy.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.411
I fear the Lord's wrath
for my unholy thoughts.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.120
The Lord is merciful.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.525
Ye may have impure thoughts,

36:04.800 --> 36:05.961
but with a pure heart,

36:07.280 --> 36:08.520
ye will have his forgiveness.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.929
'Tis hotter than the Devil's arse.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.001
Aye.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.923
Must be what it's like burning in hell.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.001
Dinna fash, lads.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.124
The foremast will soon be mended.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.049
With luck on our side,
we'll be on our way to Jamaica.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.724
Plenty of rum and rations.

36:25.800 --> 36:26.801
And lasses.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.281
What lass would lie with you?

36:28.840 --> 36:31.411
Ye're like a tatterdemalion
and smell of fartleberries.

36:33.480 --> 36:36.723
Ye dinna look or smell any better.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.804
If ye worked as hard as ye gabbed,
we would have been long underway.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.131
The men are growing restless.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.247
I dinna blame them.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.321
Lesley.

36:49.600 --> 36:53.571
I'm eager to get to Kingston myself.
Be reunited with my wife.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.762
With Captain Raines dead,
I can man the helm.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.210
But I shall leave charge of the men
and the captain's quarters to you.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.564
I'll no' argue that matter with you.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.730
Look at..  That's it, tighter...

37:09.240 --> 37:11.402
The next tide could serve us
if we had more hands.

37:12.800 --> 37:15.371
I ken someone
who's a fine hand with a needle,

37:15.800 --> 37:17.450
who can help us with the mainsail.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.601
Marsali.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.731
Aye, just over there.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.086
TWO, one.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.721
That's it.

37:38.800 --> 37:39.801
Ye boat.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.240
Get those crates loaded.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.321
Lesley, over there.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.407
Get that box for me.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.606
Hurry up and take down those tents.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.081
Heave.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.688
That's it. Keep going.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.530
How long until we can depart?

38:25.840 --> 38:27.285
If we have her rigging in place,

38:27.360 --> 38:29.010
we make sail tonight when it's cooler,

38:29.360 --> 38:30.805
that the tar
on the foremast might harden.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.200
Jamie!

38:56.120 --> 38:57.485
Jamie!

39:13.840 --> 39:14.887
Check the yardarm.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.921
Baxley, hand me yer spyglass.

39:33.720 --> 39:34.721
Sassenach.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.641
Claire!

39:50.920 --> 39:51.921
Claire!

39:52.080 --> 39:53.286
Jamie!

39:53.360 --> 39:54.361
Claire!

39:58.760 --> 39:59.761
Thank Christ.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.360
I feared I'd lost ye again.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.041
What happened to ye?

40:23.760 --> 40:25.171
Mac Dubh's wife turns up

40:25.240 --> 40:27.846
in the most unlikely of places,
does she no?

40:27.920 --> 40:30.287
Aye. She just drops in out of nowhere.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.641
Strange as that priest
may have been, Sassenach,

40:40.040 --> 40:41.280
I'm grateful he took ye in.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.528
Still canna believe
ye jumped from a ship into the ocean.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.243
Well, I had to tell you
about the warrants.

40:52.520 --> 40:56.684
Sir Percival found the body
in a cask of créme de menthe.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.442
We should've cut that body up,
left nothing to find.

41:02.720 --> 41:03.721
Jamie,

41:04.800 --> 41:09.442
Captain Leonard is an ambitious young
man. He won't stop looking for you.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.728
And I won't stop searching
for Young Ian.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.446
Leonard canna arrest a man
he canna find.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.486
Dinna fash, Sassenach.

41:20.640 --> 41:22.290
I was a wanted man when first we met.

41:22.600 --> 41:25.171
Yes, well,
I didn't like it much then either.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.811
We best get to Jamaica
before Leonard does.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.481
All

41:38.080 --> 41:39.923
finished, Honourable Wife.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.611
Thank you, Yi Tien Cho.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.569
I couldn't have done it better myself.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.281
- 1-

41:59.680 --> 42:02.968
I gave my blessing
to Fergus and Marsali.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.001
You did?

42:09.080 --> 42:10.081
He loves her.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.969
As I do you, Sassenach.

42:25.320 --> 42:29.086
So much death and suffering.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.570
The crew we lost on the Artemis,

42:32.160 --> 42:35.607
Captain Raines, Warren, Murphy.

42:37.640 --> 42:41.850
We have time to spare,
waiting for the foremast tar to harden.

42:42.400 --> 42:46.450
Ii would be a blessing to find
a wee bit of joy, would it not?

42:49.240 --> 42:50.241
Yes, it would.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.600
And what did you have in mind?

42:55.680 --> 42:56.681
A wedding.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.001
A wedding?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.446
I think I know someone
who could help us with that.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.361
I am...

43:13.600 --> 43:16.763
Deeply sorry for the pain
I've caused you, Father Fogden.

43:17.400 --> 43:18.481
I did not know

43:19.080 --> 43:20.605
of Arabella's

43:21.680 --> 43:23.603
importance to you.

43:24.520 --> 43:25.601
Where I come from,

43:26.680 --> 43:29.047
goats are not revered,

43:29.880 --> 43:32.645
as they are here and as they should be.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.890
Please, forgive my ignorance.

43:52.080 --> 43:55.129
There was a time
when I was a stranger in a strange land,

43:56.120 --> 43:57.406
much like you are now.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.768
I forgive you, Mr Willoughby.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.685
May I offer you some yupa?

44:20.240 --> 44:22.242
Here, let me help.

44:27.920 --> 44:28.921
Any nerves?

44:29.720 --> 44:30.721
No.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.001
Why would I have nerves?

44:39.600 --> 44:40.601
Well,

44:41.120 --> 44:43.043
I was nervous on my wedding day.

44:44.200 --> 44:46.043
There was so much I didn't know.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.286
There's one thing I dinna ken.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.681
When Fergus and I lie together,

45:02.280 --> 45:04.248
how do I not have a bairn?

45:05.480 --> 45:06.561
You don't want a child?

45:08.040 --> 45:10.361
It just seems most young women do.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.249
I would like one, someday.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.208
But for now, with Fergus, I just...

45:18.840 --> 45:19.887
I want to enjoy it.

45:24.920 --> 45:30.165
Fergus says he kens what to do
and I'll like it fine,

45:30.240 --> 45:31.480
once we're past the first time.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.250
I'm just not sure that's true.

45:37.600 --> 45:38.840
Why wouldn't n be?

45:41.040 --> 45:43.327
After Jamie married my mother,

45:44.200 --> 45:46.521
I saw how 'twas between them.

45:47.680 --> 45:50.206
When he drew her close,
she'd shrink away.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.522
But when I saw you with Daddy
on the ship,

45:56.760 --> 45:59.286
I think you enjoy being together.

46:01.960 --> 46:02.961
YES.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.121
We do.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.765
I want to be happy with Fergus
the way you are with Daddy,

46:11.000 --> 46:14.004
without having to worry about a bairn.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.166
You being a wise woman,
I thought you'd be worth asking.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.651
When we get back to the ship,

46:27.120 --> 46:28.884
I'll explain to you how it's done.

46:30.680 --> 46:31.681
So there is a way.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.804
Maybe you're not the devil after all.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.720
I bid thee welcome.

46:44.960 --> 46:46.325
Dearly beloved,

46:46.680 --> 46:49.729
I bless you in the name of the Lord.

46:52.480 --> 46:55.529
Wilt thou have this woman...

46:57.040 --> 46:59.486
Not me, sir, no. Him, please.

47:00.360 --> 47:03.364
Him? Are you sure? He's missing a hand.

47:06.520 --> 47:07.567
Will the bride mind?

47:07.640 --> 47:08.641
I will not.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.689
I don't suppose it's an impediment.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.691
Not as though he's lost his cock.

47:14.760 --> 47:15.761
He hasn't, has he?

47:15.920 --> 47:17.570
If ye'd hurry up and get on with it,
I could find out.

47:17.640 --> 47:18.641
Marsali.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.968
Ye know I've been
waiting to bed you for months.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.522
I'm sorry, Father. She speaks her mind.

47:24.240 --> 47:25.924
One of the many things I love about her.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.527
Your name, in its entirety, my dear?
I cannot marry you without it.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.331
Marsali Jane MacKimmie.

47:33.800 --> 47:34.801
Marsali.

47:37.480 --> 47:38.481
Marsali.

47:39.400 --> 47:41.323
Marsali. Lovely.

47:41.400 --> 47:42.970
For the love of God, Father,
are we to stand here

47:43.040 --> 47:45.725
havering about my name,
or do you intend to marry me?

47:48.640 --> 47:54.841
Will thou, Marsali Jane MacKimmie,
have this man for thy wedded husband?

47:55.920 --> 47:57.410
To have and to hold,

47:59.240 --> 48:00.844
from this day forward...

48:04.520 --> 48:05.567
Forsaking all others...

48:05.640 --> 48:06.721
I will.

48:09.960 --> 48:12.611
And you have a name, too? And a cock?

48:14.400 --> 48:16.721
I cannot marry you without it,
it's not allowed.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.124
Yes. Fergus.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.090
In its entirety, if you please.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.561
It's just Fergus.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.729
Surely, you have a surname, do you not?

48:27.720 --> 48:29.848
I cannot marry you properly without one.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.001
Fraser.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.121
His name

48:42.120 --> 48:44.407
is Fergus Claudel Fraser.

48:48.120 --> 48:51.647
Well, Fergus Claudel Fraser.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.281
Wonderful.

48:56.160 --> 48:59.562
Wilt thou, Fergus Claudel Fraser,

49:00.080 --> 49:03.084
have this woman for thy wedded wife?

49:03.400 --> 49:04.401
I will.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.201
The ring.

49:14.960 --> 49:18.123
And now, I unite you in wedlock

49:18.320 --> 49:23.167
in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

49:23.560 --> 49:24.721
Amen.

49:30.960 --> 49:31.961
I love you, too.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.009
May God bless your union.

49:43.760 --> 49:47.082
And may God bless your union, as well.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.046
Thank you, Father.

49:50.640 --> 49:51.641
Thank you, Father.

50:09.040 --> 50:12.408
You didn't take this
with you to the Porpoise.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.489
It wasn't enough to treat
hundreds of men.

50:15.960 --> 50:19.169
Besides, that antibiotic
wouldn't work against typhoid.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.603
This soup is delicious.

50:23.840 --> 50:25.171
Willoughby shall be pleased.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.923
He made ye the wee broth, special.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.161
Christ.

50:36.840 --> 50:37.841
You're burning up.

50:40.440 --> 50:41.441
I know.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.281
That's why I need this.

50:53.680 --> 50:54.681
Here.

50:55.560 --> 50:57.289
I am the doctor.

51:04.080 --> 51:05.081
Buggen

51:13.960 --> 51:14.961
Let me help you.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.326
Just push it through.

51:19.920 --> 51:20.921
YES.

51:21.240 --> 51:23.402
And then pull up the plunger.

51:24.120 --> 51:25.121
Slowly.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.280
A little bit more.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.605
Now pull it out.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.246
Turn it upright.

51:34.600 --> 51:37.001
And just push the plunger a little.

51:41.640 --> 51:42.846
All right, well,

51:44.240 --> 51:46.846
this is your chance
for revenge if you want it.

51:47.920 --> 51:50.526
Ye want me to stab ye
in the arse with this?

51:50.920 --> 51:51.921
YES.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.884
I've done it to you before.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.646
You know what it feels like.
It's not too bad, is it?

52:15.120 --> 52:16.121
Dinna think I can do it.

52:16.760 --> 52:18.649
For God's sake. Give it to me.

52:27.960 --> 52:28.961
Now,

52:29.400 --> 52:31.129
just push the plunger down.

52:45.880 --> 52:46.881
You...

52:49.360 --> 52:52.682
Should keep yer strength up.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.690
What kind of soup is this?

53:05.080 --> 53:06.127
Turtle.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.411
Manzetti took
a large hawksbill last night.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.202
Willoughby wasted
no time putting it in a pot.

53:13.200 --> 53:14.690
I've never had turtle before.

53:15.960 --> 53:20.124
You know, turtle is supposed
to be an aphrodisiac.

53:22.800 --> 53:25.690
That is very bawdy
for a respectable married woman.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.247
What do you mean?

53:28.840 --> 53:29.921
I'm respectable.

53:30.200 --> 53:31.201
Are ye now?

53:32.840 --> 53:33.921
Sitting there,

53:34.440 --> 53:35.851
with your hair loose

53:36.400 --> 53:39.961
and your nipples staring me in the eye,

53:40.040 --> 53:42.566
the size of cherries.

53:43.880 --> 53:47.043
Well, it's nothing
you haven't seen before.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.004
Bolt the door.

53:55.160 --> 53:56.366
Bolt the door?

53:58.240 --> 53:59.480
Why would I do that?

54:00.560 --> 54:01.846
Do I look like the sort of man

54:01.920 --> 54:03.570
that would take advantage of a woman

54:03.640 --> 54:06.928
that's not only wounded
and boiling with fever,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.241
but drunk <i>as</i> well?

54:09.320 --> 54:10.481
I'm not drunk.

54:11.800 --> 54:14.007
You can't get drunk on turtle soup.

54:14.080 --> 54:16.606
You can if it's Willoughby's
turtle soup.

54:17.240 --> 54:19.163
By the smell of it,
there's a whole bottle of sherry in it.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.810
Besides, you once told me

54:23.280 --> 54:25.123
that you can't be drunk

54:25.960 --> 54:27.121
- if you're standing up.
- Aye.

54:28.200 --> 54:30.362
Aye, but you are hardly standing up.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.924
Stop trying to change the subject.

54:34.040 --> 54:36.281
And ye will stop talking about it.

54:36.360 --> 54:39.364
Because I wouldn't use force on a woman.

54:40.560 --> 54:44.042
But you do have a very healthy grip,
for someone with a fever.

54:46.520 --> 54:48.602
No, it would hurt your arm.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.530
Let me worry about my arm.

54:55.320 --> 54:57.209
This must be what it's like
making love in hell.

54:59.480 --> 55:00.891
With a burning she-devil.

55:25.960 --> 55:28.884
Honourable Wife,
she enjoyed the turtle soup?

55:29.120 --> 55:31.487
Yes, yes. Very much.

55:32.680 --> 55:34.887
It was a fine hawksbill turtle.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.921
A most elegant beast.

55:38.880 --> 55:42.168
Does she wish for more?
I have made a fresh pot.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.401
No, no, no.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.370
No, she's had more than enough.

55:45.440 --> 55:46.680
No, she hasn't!

55:48.640 --> 55:50.563
- Good night, Willoughby.
- Good night.
