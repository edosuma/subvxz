He just, like, really calms me
down and lets me know, like,

19:16.633 --> 19:21.066
it's okay to feel upset and
anxious, and just, we have to

19:21.066 --> 19:24.734
work through it and just, like,
allow yourself the time to cry

19:24.734 --> 19:27.266

just, like, get yourself

19:27.266 --> 19:29.433
together.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.433

He's like, "Seriously, I totally
understand how you feel.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.467
Like, I've been through this,
and this is my safe place."

19:40.467 --> 19:42.667

I just feel like, with all

19:42.667 --> 19:45.467
those, like, officials at the
airport, and they saw all

19:45.467 --> 19:48.100

thinking we're gonna just be

19:48.100 --> 19:50.100

care, and, like...

19:50.100 --> 19:51.900
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: Then that's the time

19:51.900 --> 19:53.667
that they'll come and get us,
when we're all wasted, or...

19:53.667 --> 19:55.667
You know what I mean?
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.400

about you.

38:47.333 --> 38:52.233
It's like... do I even want to
put myself in a situation like

38:52.233 --> 38:54.500
going to the Met Ball?
Feeling insecure and wondering,

38:54.500 --> 38:57.233
like, "Am I gonna look skinny?"
You know? "Are they gonna like

38:57.233 --> 38:59.333
my dress?
What's going on?"

38:59.333 --> 39:01.867
Like, you know, I don't know.
I just don't know if I want to

39:01.867 --> 39:04.266
be put in that position.
>> JONATHAN: Stop worrying about

39:04.266 --> 39:08.333
what everybody thinks.
It's so crazy.

39:08.333 --> 39:10.233
♪ ♪

39:15.967 --> 39:18.200
>> KOURTNEY: I wonder where
Scott ever put the chair I got

39:18.200 --> 39:20.667
him for Christmas.
>> KRIS: Hi.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.934
>> KOURTNEY: Hi.
>> KRIS: I know, right?

39:22.934 --> 39:24.700
How was Mexico?
>> KOURTNEY: This is cool.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.233
>> KRIS: Isn't that beautiful?
(phone chimes)

39:26.233 --> 39:31.300
There's three different covers.
>> KOURTNEY: It was... really,

39:31.300 --> 39:34.800
really the best four days of my
life.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.233
>> KRIS: Yeah? You had fun?
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, we really had

39:37.233 --> 39:40.300
the best time ever.
>> KRIS: I don't think you

39:40.300 --> 39:44.000
should actually Instagram or put
on social media that you got so

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
sick that you threw up and then
went to sleep in it.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
>> KOURTNEY: Why? It was so
funny.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
>> KRIS: It's not funny.
>> KOURTNEY: Yes, it is.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
>> KRIS: No, it's not.
>> KOURTNEY: I feel like, on

39:52.000 --> 39:55.300
social media lately, everyone
takes themselves so seriously.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.133
>> KRIS: Yeah. Yeah.
>> KOURTNEY: And I'm over it.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.133
>> KRIS: Well, I'm glad you had
fun.

39:59.133 --> 40:01.166
>> KOURTNEY: How was the camping
day?

40:01.166 --> 40:04.000
>> KRIS: Camping was good.
I think the kids had fun.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.900
>> KOURTNEY: How was Scott?
>> KRIS: I think that he was

40:06.900 --> 40:09.767
jealous because you were having
fun, spending time with other

40:09.767 --> 40:12.066
people.
>> KOURTNEY: Well, that's really

40:12.066 --> 40:15.266
not fair.
It's just like I can't even live

40:15.266 --> 40:17.934
my life.
I can't even go anywhere.

40:17.934 --> 40:28.166
He needs to get a (bleep) life
and leave me alone.

40:28.166 --> 40:33.133
>> KOURTNEY: He needs to get a
(bleep) life and leave me alone.

40:33.133 --> 40:37.033
And he... all he does is try to
make everybody else feel bad for

40:37.033 --> 40:40.734
him and to make... try to make
me look like the bad guy in the

40:40.734 --> 40:46.133
situation, when clearly I'm
not, from, you know, ten years

40:46.133 --> 40:48.900
of this going on.
>> KRIS: Wouldn't you be sad if

40:48.900 --> 40:52.367
he truly left you alone?
You always want what you can't

40:52.367 --> 40:55.033
have, and when somebody's right
there giving you their heart on

40:55.033 --> 40:57.066
a platter...
>> KOURTNEY: He's not.

40:57.066 --> 41:01.633
He's not though.
If he was, that was one thing.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.633
He's not. That's what he...
>> KRIS: That's not his story.

41:03.633 --> 41:06.767
>> KOURTNEY: No, Mom, that's
what he makes it seem-- to you,

41:06.767 --> 41:08.934
to Kim, to Khloe...
>> KRIS: He does.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.367
>> KOURTNEY: ...to the world, to
everybody.

41:11.367 --> 41:15.233
He sits there and grovels and
feels bad for himself.

41:15.233 --> 41:21.934
So if that's... was his truth,
why can't he get it together?

41:21.934 --> 41:25.166
I have to handle it when he's
out photographed, you know...

41:25.166 --> 41:27.166
>> KRIS: Yeah.
>> KOURTNEY: ...with a different

41:27.166 --> 41:30.333
hooker every day.
He's clearly doing his own

41:30.333 --> 41:33.233
thing.
Brittny told me yesterday about,

41:33.233 --> 41:35.767
like, five different girls that
he's hooking up with.

41:35.767 --> 41:38.333
>> KRIS: What?
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah. He tricks all

41:38.333 --> 41:40.433
of you guys to think he's do...
>> KRIS: Wow.

41:40.433 --> 41:43.066
>> KOURTNEY: ...he's sitting at
home like a saint, praying to

41:43.066 --> 41:45.400
the Bible.
>> KRIS: Well, then I think you

41:45.400 --> 41:48.767
guys should just agree to have a
different relationship and both

41:48.767 --> 41:52.200
of you move on.
So I think it's actually a good

41:52.200 --> 41:54.900
idea that you don't take any
more family trips right away,

41:54.900 --> 42:01.767
because he seems to hold on to
those trips as a way of... or he

42:01.767 --> 42:04.233
thinks you're perhaps gonna get
back together with him.

42:04.233 --> 42:06.233
And he does it every single
time.

42:06.233 --> 42:08.967
>> KOURTNEY: But the other thing
is, like, I'm like, "Is he doing

42:08.967 --> 42:12.333
the trip so that most guys in
the world, like, think that

42:12.333 --> 42:14.200
we're together?"
>> KRIS: Maybe.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.433
>> KOURTNEY: 'Cause, honestly,
like, a lot of people think so.

42:16.433 --> 42:18.900
>> KRIS: Maybe that's an
insurance policy.

42:18.900 --> 42:22.266
Well, I think you got to figure
it out and make it work for you.

42:22.266 --> 42:24.433
And you want to go out and be
single.

42:24.433 --> 42:27.000
Then, on the other hand, you got
to go out and be single if he's

42:27.000 --> 42:29.166
never gonna change.
>> KOURTNEY: He's showing that

42:29.166 --> 42:32.166
he's never gonna change.
Why can't he get his life

42:32.166 --> 42:36.367
together?
>> KRIS: Oh, man.

42:36.367 --> 42:40.667
>> KOURTNEY: I feel like, for so
many years, I've been worried

42:40.667 --> 42:45.734
about, like, my actions setting
off Scott, which I think is not

42:45.734 --> 42:49.300
a healthy way to live my life.
Because at the end of the day,

42:49.300 --> 42:53.800
like, he is doing what he wants,
and he's not concerned about,

42:53.800 --> 42:56.033
you know, how it might make me
feel.

42:56.033 --> 42:59.734
I'm sick of just being, like,
the stable one who, like... I'm

42:59.734 --> 43:03.600
not gonna go do anything crazy.
I think it just feels good to

43:03.600 --> 43:09.133
not have to worry about... like,
anyone else and just do whatever

43:09.133 --> 43:11.200
I want and live my life.

43:13.300 --> 43:15.200
>> KHLOE: On the next episode...
>> KRIS: Cheers.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.133
>> KHLOE: Cheers to that.
>> KRIS: I love you.

43:17.133 --> 43:19.533
>> KHLOE: Oh, this is so fun!
We're having fun.

43:19.533 --> 43:22.333
>> KRIS: I'm drinking a lot.
(chuckles)

43:22.333 --> 43:24.734
>> KHLOE: Kourt has been out on
the dating scene recently.

43:24.734 --> 43:27.066
Did you wash your face today?
>> KOURTNEY: No.

43:27.066 --> 43:29.333
>> KHLOE: The walk of shame
right there!

43:29.333 --> 43:32.500
>> KIM: I think just knowing
that all eyes are on you when

43:32.500 --> 43:36.567
you're walking up those stairs
is really intimidating.

43:36.567 --> 43:40.433
Oh, my God, I feel like I'm
gonna throw up.
