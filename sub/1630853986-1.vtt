WEBVTT

00:19.228 --> 00:21.103
I bet I'd make it
to the water first.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.938
As long as your clothes
are off before you do.

00:27.820 --> 00:28.777
This way.

00:31.407 --> 00:32.531
Come on.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.821
Let's go this way.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.207
-Here.
-My turn.

00:49.425 --> 00:52.426
-Oh, my God.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.596
-Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?
-Oh, my gosh.

00:55.681 --> 00:59.224
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my God.

01:23.793 --> 01:25.167
-Corey.
-Wow.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.035
Sylvia, that is gorgeous.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.254
Is that part
of Lush Designs' new line?

01:29.340 --> 01:31.540
Luke is upgrading
Claire's engagement ring

01:31.634 --> 01:33.509
for their tenth anniversary.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.044
This'll be one of a kind.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.713
Her original ring
was my first commission.

01:38.808 --> 01:40.390
That's where I got my start.

01:40.518 --> 01:42.384
From there,
it was word of mouth.

01:42.478 --> 01:45.220
And now your designs are sold
nationwide.

01:45.314 --> 01:48.232
Some days it still feels unreal.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.392
Well...

01:50.486 --> 01:52.361
It's getting late.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.737
Aren't you and Bruce
going to a concert?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.572
Oh, yeah. I've really gotta go.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.741
-Um, you okay to lock up?
-Yeah.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.077
-Are you sure?
-Yes, yes. Go. Have fun.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.079
-Ooh! Sorry.
-Oh! No. Uh...

02:02.206 --> 02:04.739
Excuse me, I should have been
watching where I was going.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.000
Jesse!
I wasn't expecting you today.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.877
Are you here
for the design specifications?

02:08.963 --> 02:11.004
Well, yeah, I wanted to make
sure that the gemstones

02:11.090 --> 02:13.298
we're sourcing you
are exactly what you need.

02:13.384 --> 02:15.750
-Mm.
-Mm.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.719
Corey, is there something else?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.555
Mn-mn.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.848
Oh.

02:24.854 --> 02:26.645
Do you have that effect
on everyone?

02:26.730 --> 02:28.313
That effect?

02:28.399 --> 02:29.690
That's an occupational hazard

02:29.775 --> 02:31.441
for being a diamond broker.

02:31.569 --> 02:34.436
Everyone loves diamonds.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.240
-Hm. I don't think that's it.
-Mm.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.109
I've seen more than one person
try and hit on you.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.578
Oh, really?

02:50.421 --> 02:52.171
Are you jealous?

02:52.256 --> 02:54.423
I don't do jealous.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.841
Why are you here?

02:58.262 --> 03:00.721
Well, officially,
to get the specs...

03:00.806 --> 03:03.182
-Mm-hmm.
-Unofficially...

03:05.603 --> 03:07.969
-We agreed to be discreet.
-Everyone's gone home.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.639
It doesn't get more discreet.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.399
What about security?

03:12.484 --> 03:15.477
Because of the design leaks,
we've added more cameras.

03:15.571 --> 03:18.197
You put security cameras
in your office?

03:19.783 --> 03:21.408
Not in my office.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.171
Kat.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.667
There's something
I need you to do for me.

03:38.761 --> 03:43.138
Ooh, that's Sylvia Stafford
from Lush Designs.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.841
Make sure she's there.
We need her in our little group.

03:46.936 --> 03:50.771
Well, there-there isn't much
time. I don't know if I could...

03:50.856 --> 03:52.773
Russo.

03:52.858 --> 03:56.017
Help Kat get Ms. Stafford
to our next meeting.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.527
Certainly.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.656
-It's settled.
-Yeah. Okay.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.869
-Hi, Sylvia!
-Claire. Uh...

04:14.964 --> 04:16.204
I was afraid
you were gonna cancel.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.299
Oh, I was, too.
Nathan is teething.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.042
And I could barely get dressed
by the time the nanny

04:21.136 --> 04:23.553
got there. It was crazy.
What are you working on?

04:23.681 --> 04:25.138
It's just a new design for Lush.

04:25.224 --> 04:28.141
-Let me see.
-It's really rough.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.395
Oh, my gosh, what is that?

04:31.522 --> 04:35.056
-What? Oh, Claire! Claire, no.
-So easy!

04:35.150 --> 04:38.226
These are the kids' birthstones.
Is this for me?

04:38.320 --> 04:42.397
Luke asked me to design you
a more lavish engagement ring.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.734
Syl, this is beautiful.
I love it!

04:45.828 --> 04:48.403
But I am mad at you
for ruining the surprise.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.622
You-your-your article comes out
in the newspaper tomorrow.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.541
-Are you nervous?
-A little.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.210
They asked me so many questions,
I can hardly remember them all.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.578
But I think it'll be good.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.246
Did they ask
about your love life?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.132
No, it's for
the business section,

05:00.217 --> 05:01.508
so we talked business.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.917
Boring.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.252
Okay, well, then I will ask

05:04.346 --> 05:06.087
because Luke
has this friend Noah.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.922
-He is perfect--
-I'm seeing someone.

05:08.017 --> 05:10.592
You are? That's great!
When do I get to meet him?

05:10.686 --> 05:13.020
Are you excited
about your anniversary trip?

05:13.105 --> 05:14.929
Yeah, but you're not gonna dodge
my question.

05:15.024 --> 05:17.274
-I wanna know about this guy.
-There's nothing to tell.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.608
It's still really early,
and we're trying

05:18.736 --> 05:20.736
to keep a low profile.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.362
-What's with the look?
-Nothing.

05:22.448 --> 05:25.440
I just hope that you're gonna
find the right guy.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.034
I mean, for someone
who designs wedding rings,

05:27.119 --> 05:29.077
you seem kind of opposed
to marriage.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.446
I'm not opposed to marriage,
just not sure

05:31.540 --> 05:33.582
I'll ever find
what you and Luke have.

05:33.667 --> 05:38.128
My mom, uh, was beautiful,
talented, funny.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.048
And she ended up
in a miserable marriage.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.125
Well, you're not your mom,

05:44.219 --> 05:46.127
and it's gonna happen for you
at the right time

05:46.221 --> 05:47.763
and it's gonna be great.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.390
-You're the best.
-I know.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.280
Well, you moved on quickly.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.995
I don't see
how that's any of your business.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.864
You're right, it's not.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.199
So what am I doing here, Becca?

06:58.293 --> 07:00.210
To tell me how you plan
to pay me back

07:00.337 --> 07:02.337
for what you cost my business.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.756
I don't owe you anything.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.803
Other people may be willing
to let you off the hook.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.180
I'm not.

07:14.643 --> 07:19.271
I had some friends
do some digging, and, oh,

07:19.356 --> 07:23.224
they found some very interesting
business ventures

07:23.318 --> 07:25.610
you're involved in.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.405
I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.407
Stop wasting my time.

07:34.329 --> 07:37.080
-I'll be in touch, Jesse.
-Can't wait.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.688
Hello?

08:06.320 --> 08:07.360
Hello?

08:25.672 --> 08:28.632
Oh, thank you! You didn't have
to get me a coffee.

08:28.759 --> 08:29.925
Mm.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.794
Do I look that bad?

08:32.888 --> 08:35.180
Hm, not at all. I was already
getting one for myself.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.723
You're a terrible liar.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.646
I hardly slept last night.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.732
I kept getting anonymous calls
with no one there.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.817
-Did you block the number?
-Yeah.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.278
And then it'd happen again
with a different number.

08:50.364 --> 08:53.448
Yeah, well,
you really do need to be careful

08:53.534 --> 08:56.317
now that
you're in the public eye.

08:56.411 --> 09:00.154
I finally just shut off my phone
so I could get some sleep.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.323
Oh, my gosh, Corey.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.251
Sorry, uh,
I was just playing around.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.378
-Here, I'll put it back.
-No, no, no, no. I...

09:06.463 --> 09:09.631
I like it. You have a real eye.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.165
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.343
Oh! I almost forgot.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.004
Special delivery.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.139
Mm? Mm.

09:25.983 --> 09:29.234
I've got invited to join the
Females In Leadership society.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.653
I can't believe it.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.697
I can't believe it either.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.242
-Hm.
-Hm.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.033
-Mm-hmm.
-Have you read the article?

09:45.127 --> 09:47.294
I was too afraid
to even buy a copy.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.089
Uh, I figured that.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.426
But I will say...

09:57.014 --> 10:00.348
this is a lovely spread
in the society section.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.683
What?

10:02.644 --> 10:03.727
Uh...

10:06.356 --> 10:10.525
"Every woman should sparkle
like a star." I never said that.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.320
T-this-this was supposed to be
a business article.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.697
Yeah, but the society section
makes sense.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.116
When people think Lush Designs,
they think glamor.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.368
And almost every celebrity
wears your jewelry.

10:22.331 --> 10:24.238
"She overcame
a series of personal tragedies

10:24.333 --> 10:26.574
at an early age."

10:26.668 --> 10:28.409
Listen, I don't know what
the problem is, I'd love to have

10:28.503 --> 10:29.878
this kind of publicity
for my business.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.246
I built Lush Designs
from the ground up.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.248
I thought I was being recognized
for that.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.134
Well, I understand that,
but the part

10:36.219 --> 10:38.762
w-where you're being honest
about your father...

10:38.889 --> 10:40.055
Okay, that was off the record.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.257
Well, apparently, it was
on the record. It's right there.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.561
"Speaking
of her estranged father,

10:46.647 --> 10:49.981
Sylvia admitted a part of her
will always miss him."

10:56.698 --> 10:59.273
-What are you doing?
-I'm calling that reporter.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.775
-I'm not gonna let this go.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.944
No, no, we are not.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.278
-Come on.
-Why?

11:04.373 --> 11:06.614
-Give me the phone.
-Why?

11:06.708 --> 11:09.834
-Give me the phone.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.964
You're not gonna
call them tonight.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.008
You can call them tomorrow.

11:17.094 --> 11:19.719
Why? Because I need time
to decide or...

11:21.139 --> 11:23.431
Definitely or.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.475
This is nice.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.735
Mm-hmm.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.982
Hey, I'm really sorry
that the article

11:41.076 --> 11:42.701
wasn't what you were expecting.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.039
Well, maybe you're right.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.043
I should just enjoy
the publicity.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.760
Hey, I'm just curious. When was
the last time you saw your dad?

12:02.264 --> 12:04.681
Hm. When I was 18.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.811
The last time I saw him, he was
kicking me out of his house.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.524
Wow.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.651
And how can you still have
feelings for him

12:16.737 --> 12:18.853
after something like that?

12:18.947 --> 12:19.946
Well...

12:23.160 --> 12:26.578
I remember what he was like
when I was little.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.200
I thought I had the best dad
in the world.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.294
I was a total daddy's girl.

12:36.006 --> 12:39.632
My mom and I just adored him.

12:39.718 --> 12:44.179
That's the dad I miss,
not the bitter person he became

12:44.264 --> 12:46.014
when he started drinking.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.102
Hey.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.565
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to get too personal.

12:57.486 --> 13:00.320
I guess it's impossible to
always keep things casual, huh?

13:00.405 --> 13:01.488
Hm.

13:02.866 --> 13:03.907
God.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.907
Look what I got today.

13:13.001 --> 13:16.753
What's this?
"Females In Leadership."

13:16.880 --> 13:20.548
It's a group
of highly successful women.

13:20.634 --> 13:25.345
Ah, yeah, or a group that preys
on highly successful women.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.430
Seriously,
I hear people join these

13:27.557 --> 13:29.682
just to troll the competition.

13:29.768 --> 13:33.228
-FIL has a very good reputation.
-Yeah, the powerful often do.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.230
-All right, don't join.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.982
It's almost 12:00,
and that's the deadline anyway.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.987
How about
let's go for round two?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.616
I still have time to finish.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.210
Hello?

14:42.757 --> 14:44.674
Whoever this is,
stop calling me.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.168
Sylvia, this is Kat from FIL.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.337
The FIL? What-what time is it?

14:49.431 --> 14:52.173
There's a meeting today.
You're expected to attend.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.008
-I'll send details later.
-Today? I don't know if--

14:54.102 --> 14:56.769
Look, if you wanna join,
you'll be there.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.458
Corey.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.209
I didn't know you designed.

15:20.337 --> 15:24.005
I doodle a little.

15:24.090 --> 15:28.134
This is more than doodling.
You have real talent.

15:28.219 --> 15:31.054
-You think?
-Definitely.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.931
-May I?
-Yeah.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.359
I'd love to see
more of your designs.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.694
Yeah, of course.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.280
-Yeah.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.200
I'll be out the rest of the day,
but call me if you need me.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.402
-Yeah, I've got things here.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.238
Sylvia. Oh, my...

15:57.332 --> 15:58.665
Dad...

16:00.126 --> 16:01.575
Earl.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.295
It's, um, it's been a long time.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.082
-You saw the article.
-Heck, yeah.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.970
-I'm proud of my baby girl.
-Why are you here?

16:12.055 --> 16:14.088
Well, I just,
I thought maybe--

16:14.182 --> 16:15.390
Well, you just thought
that maybe we could be

16:15.475 --> 16:17.016
a family again?

16:18.853 --> 16:20.395
Did you come here
because of what they quoted me

16:20.480 --> 16:23.431
saying about you?

16:23.525 --> 16:26.267
Did they misquote you
when you said you miss me?

16:26.361 --> 16:28.602
Look, I know I don't deserve
a second chance.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.405
I just wanted to talk.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.606
I'm busy, Earl.

16:32.701 --> 16:33.908
All right, please, don't,
don't go off like that.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.410
I'll do what I want. Look.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.279
I'm glad you've gotten
yourself together,

16:38.373 --> 16:39.747
but don't you show up here
expecting

16:39.833 --> 16:41.708
a pat on the back from me.

16:43.378 --> 16:47.130
I'm-I'm sorry, I-I guess
I expected too much too soon.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.717
You know, I read the article,
I just, I thought...

16:53.722 --> 16:56.464
I'm sorry, Sylvia.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.391
And I'm not,
I'm not gonna bother you again.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.767
Wait.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.477
Call my office and make an
appointment with my assistant.

17:09.571 --> 17:11.779
An appointment?

17:13.283 --> 17:14.907
Thank you, baby girl.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.535
You should go.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.288
You know, you, um,
you have your mother's smile.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.374
God, I loved her smile.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.501
Then why did you always
make her cry?

17:52.697 --> 17:54.188
-Do you mind coming with me?

17:54.282 --> 17:56.657
No! No! No!

17:56.743 --> 17:59.744
-Come on!

18:03.333 --> 18:05.833
Where are we?

18:05.919 --> 18:08.044
All your questions
will be answered shortly.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.847
Please allow me to apologize
again, Ms. Stafford.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.057
I thought I was gonna die!

18:21.184 --> 18:23.551
Oh, is there a problem?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.353
-Kidnapping?
-Oh.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.689
I apologize if our initiation
tactics made you uncomfortable,

18:28.775 --> 18:31.892
but our number-one rule at FIL
is secrecy.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.227
If that's so important, then why

18:33.321 --> 18:34.737
was the address
on the invitation?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.781
Oh, that's a fake.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.732
So secrecy, just not honesty.
Okay.

18:38.827 --> 18:42.161
On the contrary, we now keep
our society under lock and key

18:42.247 --> 18:45.248
after a potential member
released footage from a meeting,

18:45.375 --> 18:47.667
along with a few
of our cutting-edge ideas.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.837
It put the FIL
in a very vulnerable state.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.747
Well, no harm was done, though.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.843
-He scared me.
-Oh. Don't get me wrong.

18:56.928 --> 19:00.087
Russo has always scared me
a little.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.924
Uh, thank you, Russo. Buh-bye.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.184
Well, now that
that's all cleared up,

19:05.270 --> 19:06.686
let me take you
to meet Elizabeth.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.596
-Elizabeth?
-Oh, the head of FIL.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.932
This is her home.
So put that away. Shall we?

19:12.026 --> 19:14.235
Elizabeth is impatient
to meet you.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.245
-Please.
-Oh, thank you.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.622
Thank you.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.617
So FIL board meetings
are anything but typical.

19:29.711 --> 19:33.171
We're dead serious when it comes
to business, though, so...

19:33.256 --> 19:34.622
Oh, here's Elizabeth now.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.957
-Welcome to my home.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.510
Elizabeth Collins, I'd like
to introduce Sylvia Stafford.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.721
I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Sylvia.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.473
Thank you. I was so thrilled
to be invited.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.134
It looks like we're
going to have to speak later.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.803
I have some business to attend
to if you'll excuse me.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.805
Will you introduce Sylvia
to the others?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.024
-Of course.
-Hm.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.737
Well, I guess I'll start
the introductions with myself.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.114
I'm sorry if we got off
on the wrong foot earlier.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.576
I'm Kat. Kat Cosmetics
is my beauty line.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.152
Maybe you've heard of it?

20:05.246 --> 20:07.371
Who hasn't?
I use all your stuff.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.490
Your eyeliners
are the absolute best.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.168
Really? Oh. Thank you.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.794
Maybe we can work out a deal.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.996
Some of your beauty
for some of my bling?

20:16.090 --> 20:19.166
Well, look at you.
I like the way you think.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.303
Oh. There's Vanessa.
You've got to meet her.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.671
And that's Becca,
in black.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.506
She has to be
the center of attention.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.308
In her mind, we're all
part of the Becca show.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.060
-Hi!
-Kat!

20:29.145 --> 20:32.513
Elizabeth said you were outside
greeting our newest member.

20:32.607 --> 20:35.066
Yes, that's right,
uh, Vanessa, Becca,

20:35.151 --> 20:37.235
I'd like to introduce
Sylvia Stafford,

20:37.320 --> 20:39.111
owner of Lush Designs.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.073
Becca owns
several fashion lines.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.325
A-are you Becca Brown?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.868
I am.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.861
Lush Designs often uses
your clothes in our ads.

20:47.956 --> 20:51.198
-They are so beautiful.
-Thank you.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.751
Uh, would you consider
a joint media campaign?

20:53.836 --> 20:56.462
I'd love for Lush Designs to
have your official endorsement.

20:56.547 --> 21:00.341
That's certainly
an interesting idea.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.717
I'll consider it.

21:01.844 --> 21:05.388
Oh! I love when pleasure
becomes business.

21:05.515 --> 21:08.099
And meet Vanessa,
creator of the hottest

21:08.184 --> 21:10.017
social-media app out there,
Ignite.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.311
Of course.
"Ignite your passion."

21:12.397 --> 21:14.388
When you join, we'll add you
to the FIL group.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.899
It's how we all keep in touch.

21:17.026 --> 21:21.445
Oh, maybe Vanessa has some ideas
for your proposed collaboration.

21:21.531 --> 21:26.492
Ah. Looks like we have
some catching up to do!

21:26.577 --> 21:28.536
-Are you and Thomas-- Ah!
-Engaged!

21:28.621 --> 21:32.373
Yes. I couldn't believe when he
surprised me with this sparkler.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.750
-Do you love it?
-Oh, of course.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.411
I'd recognize a Lush Design
anywhere.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.964
There's no mistaking your touch,
Sylvia...

21:40.967 --> 21:44.418
Wow. It looks so familiar.

21:44.512 --> 21:47.421
Uh, yeah, I mean, I-I love
your designs, Sylvia,

21:47.515 --> 21:49.923
but, uh, this is actually
by someone else.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.892
They're so new,
I don't even remember the name.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.688
Yeah. Well, if you'll excuse me,
I will be right back.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.264
Yes.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.819
Well, that went well.
What do we think?

22:01.904 --> 22:03.612
She needs to go through
the process, of course.

22:03.740 --> 22:04.864
Well, obviously.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.947
Hi, Jesse.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.950
Well, aside from being
practically kidnapped...

22:17.045 --> 22:19.086
I'll tell you later.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.922
Listen, something else happened
that was really weird, Jesse.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.293
Oh, my God. I gotta let you go.

22:26.387 --> 22:27.970
I'll talk to you later, okay?

22:30.308 --> 22:31.799
Better not let Elizabeth
catch you.

22:31.893 --> 22:34.635
-Right. I know, right.
-Work call?

22:34.729 --> 22:37.855
Uh, sorry, it's,
it's really none of my business.

22:37.940 --> 22:42.142
I wanted to talk to you alone.
I have a business proposal.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.478
Kat sure wasn't kidding
about the FIL and business.

22:44.572 --> 22:45.646
-What did you have in mind?
-Well...

22:45.740 --> 22:47.323
Last year I developed an app

22:47.450 --> 22:50.659
that I think would be perfect
for Lush Designs.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.986
You know what, we've been
concentrating so much

22:53.081 --> 22:55.164
on our physical stores, our
online presence has suffered.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.491
Well, with my app
your customers would not only

22:57.585 --> 23:00.044
be able to try on
the designs virtually,

23:00.129 --> 23:02.463
but they could explore
possible modifications.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.633
With your designs, my app will
practically allow the jewelry

23:05.718 --> 23:07.334
to sell itself.

23:07.428 --> 23:10.596
I like the sound of that.
To be continued.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.686
There you are!

23:17.814 --> 23:18.938
Hi.

23:21.317 --> 23:24.610
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to speak further.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.520
Oh, thank you.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.355
I'd love to learn more
about the FIL.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.282
It's an impressive group
that supports

23:30.368 --> 23:31.784
so many wonderful charities.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.194
I'd be honored to join
these amazing women.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.196
That's wonderful,
there are a few more formalities

23:36.290 --> 23:37.998
to attend to, but I believe

23:38.084 --> 23:41.034
you're a perfect fit
for the FIL.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.036
Everyone seemed to enjoy
meeting you,

23:43.131 --> 23:45.297
including Becca,
and that's no small feat.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.384
I'll be in touch this week.

23:48.511 --> 23:51.378
If all goes as I believe
it will, we'll announce you

23:51.472 --> 23:53.547
formally on the yacht excursion
this weekend.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.716
-Yacht excursion?
-Is there a problem?

23:55.810 --> 23:58.144
-No.
-I didn't think so.

23:58.229 --> 24:01.605
Lovely meeting you.
Excuse me.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.109
Helen!

24:20.001 --> 24:21.333
What the...

25:28.778 --> 25:31.862
If she discovers anything else
missing, have her contact me.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.781
My number's on the card
I gave her.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.950
Okay. Thank you very much,
officer.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.801
Are you okay?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.936
-No. Hey.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.014
Don't worry.
They're gonna get the guy.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.683
They're gonna get
the jewelry back.

26:09.777 --> 26:12.152
It's not about the jewels.

26:12.238 --> 26:16.073
Having the police here
brought back so many memories.

26:17.577 --> 26:21.537
How helpless I felt
when my mother died.

26:28.129 --> 26:30.754
-Come here.
-And everything's a mess.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.008
-What, here?
-Yeah.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.009
Don't...

26:36.762 --> 26:40.547
Do not, do not even worry
about it, okay?

26:40.641 --> 26:43.058
I'm gonna clean all this up.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.476
-Oh.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.487
I thought you'd gone.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.073
No, of course not. I wouldn't
leave without saying goodbye.

28:21.158 --> 28:22.783
-Aww.
-Here, I made some coffee.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.119
-Thanks for opening the door.
-Oh, you're welcome.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.321
Well, how did you sleep
last night?

28:28.416 --> 28:30.791
Very well.
Thank you for staying.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.159
Of course. My pleasure.

28:32.253 --> 28:33.493
You know if you'd like, uh,

28:33.587 --> 28:35.337
I could stay a few more nights.

28:35.464 --> 28:38.665
Thank you, Jesse, really,
oh, but I'm not sure

28:38.759 --> 28:40.634
we're quite ready for that
just yet.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.505
Okay.

28:45.599 --> 28:49.143
But just so you know,

28:49.228 --> 28:53.313
whenever you are ready,
I'm here, okay?

28:57.153 --> 28:58.351
You should've
called me.

28:58.446 --> 28:59.862
I wasn't alone.

29:00.531 --> 29:01.947
Yeah, I'm glad.

29:05.286 --> 29:08.120
Something else happened
yesterday.

29:09.165 --> 29:12.365
-Earl showed up.
-What?

29:12.460 --> 29:14.668
-I know.
-He...

29:14.754 --> 29:16.670
When I read the article, I knew
he was gonna come crawling back.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.590
I hope you kicked his sorry butt
to the curb.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.046
How can you even think
about talking to him?

29:26.140 --> 29:27.765
It's hard to explain.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.435
After your mom died,
you were convinced

29:31.520 --> 29:33.437
he had something to do with it.

29:36.484 --> 29:38.892
I never told you this,

29:38.986 --> 29:41.487
but mom and I fought that day

29:41.572 --> 29:43.572
about me spending the night
at your house.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.950
I was so mad at her,
I wouldn't even listen to her.

29:47.036 --> 29:50.913
And I said things
that I still regret.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.917
Later I snuck out
while she and Earl were arguing.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.243
Syl, I don't, I don't see how--

29:56.337 --> 29:58.545
When I got home
the next morning,

29:58.631 --> 30:02.299
Earl told me
she was mad I left.

30:02.384 --> 30:06.637
She took off and he didn't know
where she was.

30:10.851 --> 30:13.435
I should've stayed home.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.062
Maybe things would've been
different,

30:15.147 --> 30:17.397
maybe she wouldn't have gone out
on that boat alone.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.858
Syl, you know
that you are not to blame.

30:20.694 --> 30:21.652
I know.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.364
But I realized
it, it just, it wasn't fair

30:25.449 --> 30:26.940
for me to blame Earl either.

30:27.034 --> 30:31.278
Mom loved sailing.
She said it cleared her mind.

30:31.372 --> 30:32.946
It was an accident.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.123
Do you really believe that?

30:37.545 --> 30:40.453
You know, Vanessa, I'm
very excited about your app.

30:40.548 --> 30:43.215
It just, it seems tailor-made
for Lush Designs

30:43.300 --> 30:45.425
and it shows a real
understanding of jewelry design.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.961
Mm-hmm, I was hoping
you'd feel that way.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.264
I...

30:50.349 --> 30:52.966
It must've taken you
a long time.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.226
It's hard to believe
you developed it

30:54.311 --> 30:57.020
without negotiating
a deal first.

30:57.106 --> 31:00.899
Truth is,
it was originally developed

31:00.985 --> 31:02.609
for a different type
of business,

31:02.695 --> 31:06.154
but thanks to my soon-to-be ex,
a gemstone dealer,

31:06.282 --> 31:09.149
I realized it could be adapted
perfectly for jewelry design.

31:09.243 --> 31:10.409
Is there any chance
he could claim?

31:10.494 --> 31:12.652
No, thanks
to a rock-solid prenup,

31:12.746 --> 31:16.498
my lawyer says that our split
will be swift and equitable.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.208
The app is mine.

31:18.294 --> 31:20.210
-You must have a good lawyer.
-Yes.

31:20.296 --> 31:23.797
I am so glad
that I took her advice.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.758
-Now, about the app...

31:26.844 --> 31:28.969
I think we have a deal,
what do you say we head back

31:29.054 --> 31:30.637
to my office
and iron out the details, hm?

31:30.723 --> 31:32.672
-Ooh.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.766
-Uh...
-Oh, yeah.

31:34.852 --> 31:39.104
Hi, Ronnie.
Uh, no, not for a bit.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.065
Whoa, slow down.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.853
O-okay. Yeah.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.488
Sure, I'll be there in a minute.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.524
I'm sorry, I need to head back
to the office.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.285
No problem. I'll have Corey
call to reschedule.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.038
Great, uh, if you wanna send
over some sample designs,

31:56.165 --> 31:57.864
I'll add it to the app
for you to try.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.416
-Perfect.

31:59.501 --> 32:03.128
Um, Sylvia, there is something

32:03.213 --> 32:06.840
that you need to know
before we sign any contracts.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.675
Sounds serious.

32:08.761 --> 32:11.094
It could be
if I'm not upfront with you.

32:11.180 --> 32:14.214
Um, my ex is

32:14.308 --> 32:16.350
Jesse Reynolds.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.051
I believe you know him.

32:18.145 --> 32:21.721
Yes, he supplies a lot
of our jewels for Lush Designs.

32:21.815 --> 32:24.149
I think you know him
a little better than that.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.276
Trust me,
I don't need any details.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.904
I just wanna be straight
with you.

32:30.157 --> 32:32.240
Yup. Okay, talk soon.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.922
-Hello?
-It's Becca Brown.

32:47.049 --> 32:50.467
-Oh, hi, Becca, how are you?
-Wonderful, as always. Uh, so...

32:50.552 --> 32:52.419
Listen, I'm gonna be
near your office tomorrow,

32:52.513 --> 32:54.054
so I thought I'd stop by at 2:00

32:54.139 --> 32:56.089
and we can discuss
our joint media campaign.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.016
Well, I actually have
a previous commitment, Becca--

32:58.102 --> 32:59.592
I'll see you then.

32:59.687 --> 33:01.937
Oh, okay. All right.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.993
-That was surprise.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.995
Are you crazy? Why would you
scare me like that?

34:09.089 --> 34:10.497
You told me
you had plans tonight.

34:10.591 --> 34:12.332
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

34:12.426 --> 34:14.334
I'm sorry.
I had a long day today.

34:14.428 --> 34:16.803
Okay, come here.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.640
Hm.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.675
Hey. Guess what?

34:22.770 --> 34:25.187
I got you Gino's, your favorite.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.523
Then we shouldn't
let it get cold.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.364
You're not eating. Is something
wrong with your food?

34:36.492 --> 34:37.783
No, it's good.

34:42.706 --> 34:43.914
Hey.

34:50.798 --> 34:53.131
Something is on your mind.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.707
Come on, I wanna, I wanna know
what you're thinking.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.042
You can talk to me, come on.

34:56.136 --> 34:58.011
I wanna know everything
about you.

34:58.097 --> 34:59.712
You already do.

34:59.807 --> 35:03.141
It's all out there
for anyone to read.

35:03.227 --> 35:06.386
I just realized today
I don't know anything about you.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.438
I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.273
Is your divorce final?

35:14.947 --> 35:16.113
Uh, well, I...
Who told you that?

35:16.198 --> 35:19.232
You told me
your marriage was over.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.234
You told me
your divorce was final.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.036
Yeah. Who have you been
talking to?

35:23.122 --> 35:25.580
Why won't you answer
my question?

35:25.707 --> 35:28.375
Uh, because it's,

35:28.460 --> 35:32.379
it's complicated, okay?

35:32.464 --> 35:35.248
And, uh, yes,

35:35.342 --> 35:37.717
our marriage ended
a long time ago.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.220
We're now just finally making it
official, but she's fighting it.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.922
-Vanessa's fighting it?
-Yeah.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.976
-That's not what I heard.
-From who?

35:46.061 --> 35:49.104
Someone at the FIL?

35:49.231 --> 35:53.817
All right, you know, just be
careful who you trust there.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.235
I warned you about them.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.070
This-this is why
you didn't want me

35:57.156 --> 35:59.272
to join the FIL.

35:59.366 --> 36:02.617
You didn't want Vanessa
finding out about us.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.612
Does she know?
Did you tell her about it?

36:05.706 --> 36:07.831
Because we agreed
to keep this quiet.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.669
I thought we were separating
business from pleasure.

36:12.754 --> 36:15.589
I didn't realize you were
just protecting yourself.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.790
Are you worried about
the settlement from your divorce

36:17.885 --> 36:20.302
or the, getting the app?

36:21.889 --> 36:23.096
What do you know about the app?

36:23.182 --> 36:25.390
I just spent
the entire afternoon

36:25.475 --> 36:28.468
negotiating
with your soon-to-be ex-wife

36:28.562 --> 36:30.061
about using it for Lush Designs.

36:30.147 --> 36:32.805
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but Vanessa is a liar.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.641
How do you think
she's gotten so far?

36:34.735 --> 36:35.650
And this is how you treat me

36:35.777 --> 36:37.810
after I do something really nice
for you?

36:37.905 --> 36:38.987
Thanks.

37:03.347 --> 37:05.171
This is
Jesse. Leave a message.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.474
Jesse, we have some things
we need to discuss.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.605
Latte with two sugars.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.357
You remembered.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.651
I prefer it black now,
though, so...

37:17.736 --> 37:20.779
-Oh, I-I-I didn't know.
-How would you?

37:20.864 --> 37:23.690
You abandoned me
over a decade ago.

37:23.784 --> 37:26.409
You know, you say that
like you were a child.

37:26.495 --> 37:28.745
You were a legal adult, Sylvia.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.030
I was a confused high-schooler.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.959
I'd just lost the most important
person in my life.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.044
So had I.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.215
Look, I'm sorry
that I wasn't stronger,

37:40.342 --> 37:42.175
and I'm sorry
that I took to drinking.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.710
You started drinking
long before mom died.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.712
It just got worse after.

37:45.806 --> 37:48.848
Yeah, well, you know,
I got lots of regrets.

37:48.934 --> 37:52.018
I'm just grateful that
my weakness didn't affect you.

37:55.649 --> 37:58.558
You think because I'm successful

37:58.652 --> 38:01.444
that your weakness
didn't affect me?

38:01.530 --> 38:04.906
Your weakness affected
every decision of my life,

38:05.033 --> 38:08.067
every relationship
I've ever been in.

38:08.161 --> 38:12.539
Because of you, it's still
hard for me to trust anybody

38:12.624 --> 38:14.574
besides Claire...

38:14.668 --> 38:16.668
Who knows where I'd be if
it hadn't been for her family!

38:16.753 --> 38:18.244
I'm-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.714
Did you even care where I was?
If I was safe?

38:20.799 --> 38:22.757
Of course I did.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.250
Look, when I got my life
together,

38:24.344 --> 38:27.420
I wanted to see you.
I missed you.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.556
You know, when I read
that article in the paper

38:29.641 --> 38:31.933
about your past, I thought
you understood the demons

38:32.060 --> 38:33.560
that I was fighting back then.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.270
I mean, that article
gave me hope

38:35.397 --> 38:38.765
that, that we could reconnect.

38:38.859 --> 38:41.151
I just wanna be
a part of your life again.

38:42.362 --> 38:45.104
-That'll take some time.
-Yeah.

38:45.198 --> 38:48.450
And I need to know the truth
about mom.

38:49.578 --> 38:52.120
What happened between you two?

38:52.247 --> 38:54.947
She was acting strange that day.

38:55.042 --> 38:58.543
I wanted to blame you
because I'd heard you fighting,

38:58.628 --> 39:01.129
and you wouldn't even explain
afterwards.

39:02.883 --> 39:05.133
Truth can be a tricky thing,
Sylvia.

39:06.219 --> 39:08.011
It's not always easy to hear.

39:10.265 --> 39:13.308
Why did she go out
on that boat so upset?

39:13.435 --> 39:16.394
Was it really because of me?

39:16.480 --> 39:19.472
Look, I didn't wanna say
anything then.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.859
You idolized your mother. You...

39:24.404 --> 39:25.862
Oh, God.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.366
Your mother was, um...

39:31.078 --> 39:32.118
Your-your mother had an affair.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.821
She loved you.

39:34.915 --> 39:38.991
She wouldn't let either of us
give up on you.

39:39.086 --> 39:41.994
She would never have done that.

39:42.089 --> 39:44.497
-Who was it?
-Does it matter?

39:44.591 --> 39:47.500
Yes. It matters to me.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.761
I need to know all of it
to understand.

39:51.223 --> 39:54.182
He worked with her.
You didn't know him.

39:56.937 --> 40:01.347
I promise not to withhold
the truth from you again.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.850
All this, this is a lot.

40:03.944 --> 40:06.736
Yeah, I know it is, baby girl.
I know.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.858
You didn't have to see me
back to my office, but thanks.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.026
Well, I didn't want you
to be alone.

40:14.121 --> 40:17.363
That was quite a bombshell
I dropped on you.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.165
I'm still having trouble
believing it.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.376
I understand. Hey, look,
I'm here for you now, baby girl.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.795
I'm-I'm not ready to forgive
and forget. Just, just talk.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.463
Sorry, absolutely.

40:25.549 --> 40:26.548
Sylvia.

40:28.343 --> 40:32.044
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting this...

40:32.139 --> 40:33.471
Becca, you're early.

40:33.557 --> 40:35.765
I believe if you're not
five minutes early,

40:35.851 --> 40:36.933
you're late.

40:38.645 --> 40:41.062
You-you seem so familiar.
Have we met before?

40:41.189 --> 40:43.222
I don't know. Have we?

40:43.316 --> 40:45.483
My name's Earl.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

40:45.569 --> 40:48.945
Becca Brown. You know,
I never forget a handsome face.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.239
Well, I'm sure I'll remember.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.399
If you'll excuse us,
we have a meeting.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.493
Certainly. Uh, we'll talk soon.

40:55.579 --> 40:57.203
Becca Brown,
it was a pleasure meeting you.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.455
Hm.

41:01.460 --> 41:03.877
Well, I think he's a little
too old for you, Sylvia,

41:03.962 --> 41:06.045
but he's very charming.

41:06.882 --> 41:09.132
Becca, Earl's my father.

41:11.303 --> 41:12.552
Hm.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.223
Do we have a deal?

41:17.309 --> 41:19.934
You've convinced me,
I think the joint media campaign

41:20.061 --> 41:21.728
is a brilliant idea.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.597
I'm glad. I'm very excited
to work with you.

41:24.691 --> 41:28.109
Thank you. Oh, so beautiful.

41:28.236 --> 41:30.862
Who, uh, sources your jewels?

41:30.947 --> 41:33.773
Jesse Reynolds.
Do you know him?

41:33.867 --> 41:36.159
Unfortunately. He's married
to a friend of mine.

41:36.244 --> 41:37.610
They're going through
a nasty divorce.

41:37.704 --> 41:40.079
Apparently, Jesse's business

41:40.165 --> 41:42.707
relies on funding
from my friend.

41:44.377 --> 41:45.952
Be careful that his troubles

41:46.046 --> 41:49.622
don't become your troubles. Hm?

41:49.716 --> 41:52.509
Send over the contracts. I'll
have my lawyers review them.

41:52.594 --> 41:54.469
Oh. I'll see myself out.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.726
Wait, did the deal fall through?

42:01.811 --> 42:03.937
No, she loved the concept.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.022
Okay, that's great.
But why did you both look so--

42:06.107 --> 42:08.691
Corey, could you have head
of security come to my office?

42:08.777 --> 42:10.693
Yeah. I'll call him now.

42:26.586 --> 42:28.753
Captain Spinks will have
the champagne chilled

42:28.838 --> 42:31.831
and ready to pour when we arrive
at the boat on Saturday.

42:31.925 --> 42:33.666
And what time do we set sail?

42:33.760 --> 42:35.668
I had to give my invitation
to Sylvia,

42:35.762 --> 42:37.178
and I haven't written it down.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.097
Well, I didn't send one to her
because I thought

42:39.182 --> 42:40.890
we were discussing
her membership today.

42:40.976 --> 42:42.350
My mistake.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.343
How did your meeting go
with Sylvia?

42:44.437 --> 42:46.396
Oh, you know,
everything seems to be in order.

42:46.481 --> 42:49.015
I think she has a lot to offer
the FIL.

42:49.109 --> 42:51.442
Excellent.

42:51.528 --> 42:54.020
-And I even met her father.
-Oh!

42:54.114 --> 42:56.155
I thought Sylvia and her father
were estranged.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.241
That's what I read,
you know, if I were her,

42:58.326 --> 43:00.359
I wouldn't wanna see him again.

43:00.453 --> 43:02.453
I found her father
perfectly charming.

43:02.539 --> 43:04.038
Charming or handsome?

43:04.165 --> 43:06.165
You've been known to confuse
good looks

43:06.251 --> 43:07.834
for a winning personality,

43:07.919 --> 43:10.211
and they haven't all proven
to be winners.

43:12.007 --> 43:13.840
I don't care
for what you're insinuating.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.375
I mean, he was my type.

43:16.469 --> 43:18.469
And I think I've met him before.

43:18.555 --> 43:21.097
And once I figure it out,
I intend to rekindle

43:21.182 --> 43:24.058
whatever fire we had
between us.

43:24.185 --> 43:28.563
Just do me a favor and look
before you leap this time.

43:28.690 --> 43:30.690
With your taste in men,

43:30.775 --> 43:33.559
you should do a background check
before you get involved.

43:33.653 --> 43:37.238
Send Sylvia her invitation.

43:37.365 --> 43:41.400
We will be announcing the newest
member of the FIL Saturday,

43:41.494 --> 43:42.619
on the boat.

43:45.206 --> 43:48.207
I'm excited Sylvia's joining.
Aren't you, Becca?

43:50.003 --> 43:52.211
-What's wrong, Becca?
-Hm?

43:52.297 --> 43:54.172
Oh, no, nothing.

43:54.257 --> 43:57.342
I was just thinking
that maybe Elizabeth is right,

43:57.427 --> 43:59.927
and maybe I should have
my people do some research

44:00.055 --> 44:02.889
on Earl Stafford,
get an edge on the competition.

44:05.185 --> 44:07.927
-Bye, Becca.
-You think I'm kidding?

44:08.021 --> 44:11.097
-I'm just saying.
-I think it's a brilliant idea.

44:11.191 --> 44:12.598
-Of course you do.
-What?

44:12.692 --> 44:14.484
I can't believe
I didn't think about it before.

44:14.569 --> 44:15.902
You sure
you're okay, 'cause

44:15.987 --> 44:17.362
Luke and I can go
another weekend.

44:17.447 --> 44:19.197
No, no, no, no.
You guys need this.

44:19.282 --> 44:21.607
I'm fine, I actually, uh,

44:21.701 --> 44:24.702
have plans with the FIL
this weekend.

44:24.788 --> 44:28.948
Oh, do tell. Where are they
kidnapping you to next?

44:29.042 --> 44:31.959
This time
I will be driving myself.

44:32.087 --> 44:35.922
We're going to the marina
for a boat excursion.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.174
-And you're okay with that?
-I'm a little nervous.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.968
But they promised
the champagne will be flowing,

44:41.096 --> 44:44.296
and I think I'll need it
when this week is over.

44:44.391 --> 44:47.225
Yeah, it's been a rough one.

44:47.310 --> 44:49.468
It's not over yet.

44:49.562 --> 44:51.145
I'm ending things with Jesse.

44:51.272 --> 44:54.440
-It's Jesse? Jesse? Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

44:54.526 --> 44:55.975
I get why you didn't wanna
tell me.

44:56.069 --> 44:57.276
Mm-hmm.

44:57.362 --> 45:00.146
Syl, I'm sorry. Come here.

45:00.240 --> 45:01.781
You're gonna be okay.

45:03.702 --> 45:06.160
God, I don't know what I'd do
without you.

48:35.580 --> 48:36.829
Dad?

48:37.582 --> 48:39.498
Oh, hey, Sylvia.

48:39.584 --> 48:41.533
Happy 18th. Happy 18th.

48:41.628 --> 48:46.005
You got no idea how long
I've been waiting for this day.

48:46.090 --> 48:48.874
You know, I've been thinking,
I think it's time that you, uh,

48:48.968 --> 48:52.044
spread your wings, fly, fly!

48:52.138 --> 48:55.547
Packed your bags for ya.

48:55.642 --> 48:57.975
Dad, what's this all about?

48:58.061 --> 49:00.886
It's about you talking behind
my back to that little friend

49:00.980 --> 49:03.022
of yours, Claire,
yeah, for months,

49:03.107 --> 49:05.557
saying I had something to do
with your mother's death!

49:05.652 --> 49:07.818
Your mother's death!
I wasn't even on the boat.

49:07.904 --> 49:11.530
You're an adult now, so you take
your suspicions and you get out!

49:11.616 --> 49:13.399
-Get out!
-I don't have any money, dad.

49:13.493 --> 49:15.326
Oh, gee, what
a coinkydink. Neither do I.

49:15.411 --> 49:17.787
You've been like an anvil
around my neck.

49:17.872 --> 49:21.248
I can't wait to get rid of you
and be free!

49:21.376 --> 49:23.042
You got a problem with that?

49:25.380 --> 49:27.588
You take it up with her.

49:27.715 --> 49:29.006
Now get out!

50:24.897 --> 50:26.972
Let me finish
the outline.

50:27.066 --> 50:31.027
But it tickles.
Okay, I'm done.

50:31.112 --> 50:33.979
Now let's design
you a ring.

50:34.073 --> 50:38.075
I want a heart,
because you are my heart.

50:38.161 --> 50:40.202
Mom, so lame.

50:40.288 --> 50:44.165
Love is not lame.

50:44.292 --> 50:46.876
I love you, Sylvia.

50:46.961 --> 50:48.586
I love you, too, mom.

51:08.524 --> 51:10.858
What? What's this?

51:27.752 --> 51:30.461
Mom, who is this?

51:37.970 --> 51:40.712
-Good morning, you.
-Oh, good morning.

51:40.807 --> 51:44.216
-Here you go. Of course.
-Oh, thank you.

51:44.310 --> 51:45.717
-What's this?
-Oh.

51:45.812 --> 51:48.554
It's my sketchbook
from high school.

51:48.648 --> 51:50.722
I was drawing jewelry
long before

51:50.817 --> 51:53.609
I dreamed about starting
Lush Designs.

51:53.694 --> 51:54.944
Take a look.

51:56.322 --> 51:57.613
Thanks.

51:59.617 --> 52:04.236
You know, I thought about you
calling your designs doodles.

52:04.330 --> 52:06.413
They can be so much more
if you want.

52:08.417 --> 52:11.794
This could literally be
in Lush Designs' next catalog.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.171
Oh, wow.

52:15.508 --> 52:17.550
Claire would love this one.

52:18.845 --> 52:21.095
You've always been so talented.

52:21.222 --> 52:24.590
I see the same kind of talent
in you.

52:24.684 --> 52:26.892
I'd like to help you
if you'll let me.

52:26.978 --> 52:29.728
-Yeah? Uh-huh?
-Mm-hmm.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.605
Thank you. I'd like that.

52:32.859 --> 52:34.766
Uh, Corey,

52:34.861 --> 52:38.937
what do you know
about DNA testing?

52:39.031 --> 52:41.773
What? You think
Jesse's someone's baby daddy?

52:41.868 --> 52:44.109
What? No
Why would you bring up Jesse?

52:44.203 --> 52:45.744
Oh, my God! Come on!

52:45.830 --> 52:47.413
We both know
you have something going on.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.582
-No.
-Don't deny it.

52:49.667 --> 52:52.668
-I...
-Look.

52:52.753 --> 52:56.213
If Jesse thins
he's someone's father,

52:56.299 --> 52:59.967
I think he just needs
to work that out for himself.

53:01.679 --> 53:04.630
Well, he's not the one.

53:04.724 --> 53:09.268
Oh. Oh, so you think
he's the father?

53:10.813 --> 53:14.231
Uh, the same thing happened
to my brother.

53:14.317 --> 53:18.277
His ex-girlfriend claims that
he was the father of her child.

53:18.362 --> 53:19.904
-What did he do?
-Well...

53:19.989 --> 53:22.147
He snatched the kid's bottle
and gave it to me

53:22.241 --> 53:23.982
and I gave it to my friend
that works in a lab.

53:24.076 --> 53:25.651
-Did that work?
-Yeah.

53:25.745 --> 53:28.204
Turns out he wasn't the father.

53:28.289 --> 53:29.788
Do you think
your friend would help me?

53:29.874 --> 53:32.324
Oh, yeah.
She's a big fan of yours.

53:32.418 --> 53:36.995
Look, don't worry about it.
I got you, okay?

53:37.089 --> 53:38.839
-Thank you.
-Of course.

53:47.433 --> 53:49.391
Hi, dad.

53:50.228 --> 53:52.436
Um, can you meet today?

53:53.940 --> 53:56.941
Hi,
I'm here to see Sylvia.

53:57.026 --> 53:59.318
-Yeah, of course, follow me.
-Thank you.

54:09.497 --> 54:12.030
Right this way.
Ms. Stafford will see you now.

54:12.124 --> 54:13.415
-Thank you.
-Of course.

54:13.501 --> 54:15.084
-Hi.
-Hi.

54:15.169 --> 54:17.169
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

54:20.299 --> 54:24.093
Um, before we start,
I have to ask.

54:26.472 --> 54:29.214
How did you know
Jesse and I were dating?

54:29.308 --> 54:33.218
I heard you on the phone
at the party.

54:33.312 --> 54:34.853
Hm. I...

54:34.939 --> 54:37.222
I know we planned to finalize
our agreement today,

54:37.316 --> 54:41.059
but I-I have to ask you a
couple of questions about Jesse.

54:41.153 --> 54:44.113
I... You haven't heard
about Becca?

54:44.198 --> 54:47.449
-What happened to Becca?
-Um...

54:47.535 --> 54:50.244
Becca died in her sleep
last night.

54:50.371 --> 54:54.072
-What?
-Her assistant found her. Um...

54:54.166 --> 54:57.293
They think it may have been
a, a heart attack.

54:58.796 --> 55:00.045
I...

55:01.173 --> 55:02.423
Thank you.

55:04.218 --> 55:06.218
She seemed like quite the force.

55:06.304 --> 55:07.511
Hm.

55:08.347 --> 55:10.922
She was.

55:11.017 --> 55:13.100
Right now she'd just be
telling me to stop blubbering

55:13.227 --> 55:14.259
and get down to business.

55:14.353 --> 55:15.561
Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.855
-We can reschedule.
-No. Oh, no.

55:17.940 --> 55:19.598
I wanna talk about this now.

55:19.692 --> 55:23.068
Um, you seemed upset earlier.

55:24.739 --> 55:26.772
Let me guess.

55:26.866 --> 55:28.615
Jesse told you the app was his?

55:28.743 --> 55:33.612
He exploded when I told him
Lush Designs would be using it.

55:33.706 --> 55:36.782
I haven't talked to him since.
He's not answering my calls.

55:36.876 --> 55:39.951
Mm, typical Jesse.

55:40.046 --> 55:42.046
I don't play games.

55:42.131 --> 55:45.090
Not in my personal life
or in business.

55:46.218 --> 55:48.260
Is the app yours or Jesse's?

55:50.181 --> 55:53.265
Remember when I told you
I initially created the app

55:53.351 --> 55:55.801
for a different type
of product?

55:55.895 --> 55:59.304
Well, I intended it for Becca

55:59.398 --> 56:01.440
to use for her accessory lines.

56:01.525 --> 56:05.027
Scarves, hats, sunglasses.

56:05.112 --> 56:07.738
Imagine my surprise
when my assistant showed me

56:07.823 --> 56:10.532
an almost identical app
in the app store.

56:10.618 --> 56:13.652
I mean,
it was so similar to Becca's,

56:13.746 --> 56:17.498
it couldn't have been
a coincidence.

56:17.625 --> 56:21.168
I must've looked like you
when you saw Kat's ring at FIL.

56:21.295 --> 56:23.003
You knew the design was mine.

56:23.130 --> 56:26.298
I told you, I'm a fan.

56:26.384 --> 56:30.001
I saw your reaction and I knew
something was up with the ring.

56:30.096 --> 56:32.137
And then later, whenever
I heard you talking to Jesse,

56:32.223 --> 56:34.390
it was clear to me
what happened.

56:34.475 --> 56:37.267
So you think Jesse
stole my design for Claire?

56:38.604 --> 56:39.436
Don't you?

56:41.107 --> 56:42.514
I'm glad
you could make it.

56:42.608 --> 56:44.516
I didn't think
you'd call me so soon.

56:44.610 --> 56:48.019
I hope that meeting of yours
yesterday went well.

56:48.114 --> 56:50.781
You sure know
some impressive people.

56:50.866 --> 56:54.359
Hey, did that, that lovely lady,
did she remember me?

56:54.453 --> 56:56.361
-No, she-she didn't.
-Oh.

56:56.455 --> 56:58.705
Um, I doubt
Becca really knew you.

56:58.833 --> 57:02.126
You two didn't exactly run
in the same social circles.

57:02.211 --> 57:03.585
Didn't?

57:03.671 --> 57:05.921
-Join.
-Oh, sure.

57:08.050 --> 57:09.049
Oh...

57:11.262 --> 57:15.013
Um, Becca died in her sleep
last night.

57:16.142 --> 57:17.474
Oh, my.

57:18.477 --> 57:21.520
Uh, I am sorry to hear that.

57:21.605 --> 57:23.981
I was just getting to know her,
but a lot of people

57:24.066 --> 57:25.315
will miss her.

57:27.736 --> 57:29.611
Thanks for being
so patient with me.

57:29.697 --> 57:34.065
I never expected
to see you again, dad.

57:34.160 --> 57:36.910
I needed a little time
to get used to the idea

57:37.037 --> 57:39.455
of you being back in my life.

57:40.207 --> 57:42.082
Dad.

57:42.209 --> 57:44.743
I didn't think I'd hear you
call me that again.

57:44.837 --> 57:46.295
I'm trying.

57:49.300 --> 57:51.249
Honestly,
I'm still pretty upset to learn

57:51.343 --> 57:53.010
mom was cheating on you.

57:54.388 --> 57:55.596
I never should've told you that.

57:55.723 --> 57:57.639
No, I'm-I'm glad you told me.

57:57.725 --> 57:59.391
I wanted the truth.

57:59.477 --> 58:01.768
Just may take a while
for me to accept it.

58:01.896 --> 58:03.604
Of course, yeah.

58:03.731 --> 58:07.232
I-I'm just, I'm just so happy
that I'm in your life again.

58:08.694 --> 58:11.778
-We'll see.
-Okay.

58:11.906 --> 58:13.271
I should get back to the office.

58:13.365 --> 58:14.439
-So soon?
-Yeah.

58:14.533 --> 58:16.575
I have a busy day ahead of me.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.610
-Okay.
-Um...

58:18.704 --> 58:20.445
I can take that
if you're finished.

58:20.539 --> 58:22.781
Oh, uh, thank you. Sure, yeah.

58:22.875 --> 58:24.082
Of course.

58:33.969 --> 58:35.961
So you, uh, you remember,
when you were a kid,

58:36.055 --> 58:39.130
we used to come here
and you'd catch tadpoles?

58:39.225 --> 58:41.475
-Yeah.
-Get the fireflies at night?

58:41.602 --> 58:44.302
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

58:44.396 --> 58:46.104
Hey, do you, uh, do you suppose
your old man

58:46.190 --> 58:47.305
could get just one hug?

58:47.399 --> 58:49.441
Hm. Sure.

58:53.697 --> 58:56.114
Oh.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.783
-It was good seein' you. Okay.
-Okay. Yeah.

58:57.868 --> 59:00.619
-I'll see you later.
-All right.

59:00.704 --> 59:02.871
-Drive carefully.
-Yeah.

59:08.629 --> 59:10.829
Hey, there you are.

59:10.923 --> 59:13.006
-Fresh from the printer.
-Ooh.

59:15.761 --> 59:18.637
Oh, these look great, thank you

59:18.722 --> 59:19.805
for picking them up
on your lunch hour.

59:19.890 --> 59:21.473
Yeah, anytime, the printer

59:21.559 --> 59:23.892
was right next door
to my favorite deli,

59:23.978 --> 59:27.980
who, by the way,
have the best cookies.

59:28.065 --> 59:31.349
-You're too good to me.
-Yeah, that's probably true.

59:31.443 --> 59:35.320
Oh, um, Corey, remember what
we were talking about earlier?

59:35.406 --> 59:36.905
-Jessie's kid?
-Yes.

59:36.991 --> 59:40.117
Um, so I met up with, um, Jesse

59:40.202 --> 59:42.694
and I took the cup
he was drinking out of,

59:42.788 --> 59:46.915
and, um, I was wondering
if maybe you could...

59:47.001 --> 59:48.366
-Give it to my friend?
-Yeah.

59:48.460 --> 59:50.210
-Yeah, I can do that.
-Thank you.

59:50.337 --> 59:52.337
God, you move fast.

59:52.423 --> 59:54.673
But, you know, I'm gonna need
something from the kid as well.

59:54.758 --> 59:58.218
-Oh, that's the easy part.
-Get it, girl.

59:58.345 --> 1:00:02.380
So, wait,
how old is this kid, anyway?

1:00:02.474 --> 1:00:04.215
'Cause you gotta think about
what you're getting yourself

1:00:04.310 --> 1:00:09.187
into, like, are we talking
about homework or diapers or...

1:00:09.273 --> 1:00:11.222
What, am I jumping
too far ahead?

1:00:11.317 --> 1:00:13.692
No, no, that's not it.
I-I-I can't find the cup.

1:00:13.777 --> 1:00:16.320
-It's gone.
-What do you mean?

1:00:17.823 --> 1:00:19.698
Well, where did you have it?

1:00:23.037 --> 1:00:25.078
Did you actually get it?

1:01:09.792 --> 1:01:11.449
-It's been a long day, Jesse.
-Ah.

1:01:11.543 --> 1:01:14.211
-Well, hi.
-What are you doing here?

1:01:14.296 --> 1:01:16.254
I'm sorry, can we talk?

1:01:23.263 --> 1:01:25.806
I have to go grab something.
I'll be right back.

1:01:28.185 --> 1:01:29.893
I'll be here.

1:02:25.576 --> 1:02:26.867
Jesse.

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:36.367
What's this?

1:02:36.462 --> 1:02:39.254
Stuff you left here.
I got it all together.

1:02:44.094 --> 1:02:46.887
Well...

1:02:47.014 --> 1:02:49.848
Babe, l-let's just leave it here
for the next time I come over.

1:02:49.933 --> 1:02:53.560
There's not gonna be
a next time, Jesse. We're done.

1:02:55.147 --> 1:02:57.689
Sylvia, you can't mean that.
Come on.

1:02:57.775 --> 1:02:59.775
Over a misunderstanding?
It was just a little lovers'--

1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:02.861
It was more than that,
and you know it.

1:03:02.946 --> 1:03:05.063
You lied to me.

1:03:05.157 --> 1:03:07.240
Yeah, babe, why don't we just
sit down and talk about it?

1:03:07.367 --> 1:03:09.400
It's-it's nothing
we can't get past,

1:03:09.495 --> 1:03:11.369
and I know you've also been
really stressed

1:03:11.455 --> 1:03:15.073
with your dad just showing up
out of the blue, and Vanessa...

1:03:15.167 --> 1:03:17.125
Let's-let's talk about Vanessa.
I-I wanna--

1:03:17.211 --> 1:03:19.461
She warned me you would play
this kind of game.

1:03:19.546 --> 1:03:21.254
She's a smart woman.

1:03:21.381 --> 1:03:22.798
I can't believe she put up
with stuff like this.

1:03:22.883 --> 1:03:24.800
Wow, okay,
so that's what's going on.

1:03:24.885 --> 1:03:27.418
She, uh, she poisoned you
against me.

1:03:27.513 --> 1:03:30.305
-No. I can think for myself.
-Really?

1:03:30.390 --> 1:03:32.098
But she told me
about her experiences with you,

1:03:32.226 --> 1:03:34.926
and I realized
we had a lot in common.

1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:36.928
You have nothing in common.

1:03:37.022 --> 1:03:40.265
Believe me, you are one
of a kind, and what you and I--

1:03:40.359 --> 1:03:43.268
Oh, God, stop! Well, it's over!

1:03:43.362 --> 1:03:46.279
-Personally and professionally!
-What does that mean?

1:03:46.406 --> 1:03:49.699
It means I'm terminating your
contracts with Lush Designs.

1:03:49.785 --> 1:03:51.326
You can't do that.

1:03:51.411 --> 1:03:53.444
My legal team is already on it.

1:03:53.539 --> 1:03:55.997
You can't, you can't do that.

1:04:01.296 --> 1:04:03.621
You can't do that!

1:04:03.715 --> 1:04:05.590
You can't!

1:04:05.676 --> 1:04:08.218
Whatever you think has gone
wrong between you and I

1:04:08.303 --> 1:04:10.804
has nothing to do with business,
I supply Lush Designs

1:04:10.931 --> 1:04:13.223
with the highest-quality jewels
on the market!

1:04:14.434 --> 1:04:16.726
You are unbelievable.

1:04:16.812 --> 1:04:21.189
Everything you just did
I have on camera.

1:04:21.275 --> 1:04:23.233
Take a look.

1:04:28.615 --> 1:04:31.324
-That's not what it looks like.
-Hm.

1:04:31.451 --> 1:04:32.659
I was taking those
so that I could start

1:04:32.786 --> 1:04:34.452
outsourcing stones for you.

1:04:34.538 --> 1:04:36.413
Hm.

1:04:36.498 --> 1:04:39.332
-How dedicated you are, Jesse.
-Thank you.

1:04:39.459 --> 1:04:41.960
I spoke to my head of security
yesterday.

1:04:42.045 --> 1:04:43.795
He's been reviewing
our security measures

1:04:43.881 --> 1:04:47.665
and believes the breeches came
from outside of Lush Designs.

1:04:47.759 --> 1:04:50.051
I just got the proof.

1:04:50.137 --> 1:04:52.387
Sylvia, just, please,
let me explain--

1:04:52.472 --> 1:04:55.006
What is there to explain, Jesse?

1:04:55.100 --> 1:04:58.894
How you stole from Lush Designs
or how you broke in to my home?

1:04:58.979 --> 1:05:01.271
-I didn't break into your home.
-Oh, save it.

1:05:01.356 --> 1:05:04.357
Get out
or I'm calling the police.

1:05:07.362 --> 1:05:08.686
You wouldn't.

1:05:08.780 --> 1:05:11.781
Oh, I would. Oh, honey, I would.

1:05:19.082 --> 1:05:20.373
Fine.

1:05:21.084 --> 1:05:22.292
Fine.

1:05:29.509 --> 1:05:32.802
Oh, and just so you know, I'm
not gonna let you trash my name.

1:05:35.140 --> 1:05:37.182
Your name isn't worth trashing.

1:06:10.550 --> 1:06:15.053
Mm. So I'm assuming
Jesse talked to you?

1:06:15.138 --> 1:06:17.305
Oh...

1:06:19.184 --> 1:06:21.759
-Yes, he called.
-Mm.

1:06:21.853 --> 1:06:24.688
-And he was furious.
-Hm?

1:06:24.773 --> 1:06:26.773
Can you believe
he blamed me for everything?

1:06:26.900 --> 1:06:28.316
Yes, I can.

1:06:29.736 --> 1:06:31.945
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, I'm not.

1:06:33.699 --> 1:06:36.574
-It's nice of you to come over.
-Yeah.

1:06:36.660 --> 1:06:40.111
Well, I guess I didn't really
have to worry about you.

1:06:40.205 --> 1:06:43.248
I am embarrassed
to admit that...

1:06:44.376 --> 1:06:47.952
despite Jesse's many betrayals,

1:06:48.046 --> 1:06:50.714
I fell apart when we split up.

1:06:50.799 --> 1:06:52.290
Aww. Things were different
for you.

1:06:52.384 --> 1:06:54.217
You two were married.

1:06:55.887 --> 1:06:57.637
Honestly, I went
into my relationship with him

1:06:57.764 --> 1:06:59.848
like all my others,

1:06:59.933 --> 1:07:02.434
looking for a way out.

1:07:02.519 --> 1:07:05.970
We are opposites then,
I always run in, head-first,

1:07:06.064 --> 1:07:08.806
sure that this guy is the one.

1:07:08.900 --> 1:07:12.143
-Wish I could be like that.
-Oh, no.

1:07:12.237 --> 1:07:16.364
It's lonely not letting anyone
get too close.

1:07:16.450 --> 1:07:20.326
Well, maybe we can help
each other.

1:07:20.454 --> 1:07:23.154
You keep me
from diving in too fast

1:07:23.248 --> 1:07:25.323
and I'll keep you
from running away.

1:07:25.417 --> 1:07:28.493
-I'll drink to that. Cheers.
-Yeah.

1:07:28.587 --> 1:07:30.336
I can't believe
we ate it all.

1:07:30.464 --> 1:07:32.964
Well, it had to be done.

1:07:33.050 --> 1:07:35.675
-I better get going.
-You're welcome to stay.

1:07:35.802 --> 1:07:40.263
Oh, that's sweet,
but I really oughta go.

1:07:40.348 --> 1:07:43.016
Please stay? I'm nervous
about the boat trip tomorrow.

1:07:43.143 --> 1:07:45.018
I-I don't like boats.

1:07:45.145 --> 1:07:47.812
Do you get motion sickness?
I have an extra wristband.

1:07:47.898 --> 1:07:50.273
No, it's not that, I...

1:07:50.358 --> 1:07:53.485
I spent a lot of time on boats
as a kid and I used to love it,

1:07:53.570 --> 1:07:56.112
but not anymore.

1:07:57.365 --> 1:08:00.700
Okay. I'll stay.

1:08:00.827 --> 1:08:03.495
-You are an angel.

1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:05.363
I'll need some more wine,
though.

1:08:05.457 --> 1:08:07.207
-Please?
-Yes, ma'am.

1:08:40.033 --> 1:08:41.658
Hey, Captain Spinks.

1:08:41.743 --> 1:08:43.201
-How you doin'?
-Jesse.

1:08:43.286 --> 1:08:44.994
Hey, I'm surprised
to see you here today.

1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:47.071
Last I heard, you and your wife
were about to get a--

1:08:47.165 --> 1:08:49.240
Yeah, we're getting a divorce.
We are, we are.

1:08:49.334 --> 1:08:52.743
I just wanna give these, though,
to my girlfriend. We...

1:08:52.838 --> 1:08:54.745
We just had a little bit
of a misunderstanding.

1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:55.922
Girlfriend?

1:08:58.677 --> 1:09:00.468
Best I can do
is give these to her for you.

1:09:00.554 --> 1:09:02.929
-Which of the ladies?
-Well...

1:09:03.056 --> 1:09:04.389
Her name is Sylvia Stafford,
but I'd really like

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:06.591
to give 'em to her myself.

1:09:06.685 --> 1:09:08.643
I don't want a scene today,
Jesse.

1:09:14.818 --> 1:09:15.900
Okay.

1:09:55.442 --> 1:09:58.651
-Oh! Moring.
-Oh. Good morning.

1:09:59.321 --> 1:10:01.196
Oh!

1:10:01.281 --> 1:10:03.573
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

1:10:03.658 --> 1:10:05.992
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes, please.

1:10:06.995 --> 1:10:08.319
Oh.

1:10:08.413 --> 1:10:11.539
Mm-hmm. Oh, yes, thank you.

1:10:14.669 --> 1:10:17.170
-You okay?
-Hm.

1:10:17.297 --> 1:10:20.831
Jesse sent me a text.
He wants to see me tonight.

1:10:20.926 --> 1:10:23.092
He wants to make things right.

1:10:23.178 --> 1:10:25.970
Mm. Well,
he doesn't give up easy.

1:10:26.056 --> 1:10:27.672
He was pretty freaked out
when he found out

1:10:27.766 --> 1:10:30.183
you were getting your lawyers
involved.

1:10:30.310 --> 1:10:32.936
Just ignore him, okay?

1:10:33.021 --> 1:10:37.515
-You're right. Mm.
-Is that it?

1:10:37.609 --> 1:10:40.017
Did you get a message from
the boat's captain this morning?

1:10:40.111 --> 1:10:43.488
Captain Spinks? No.
My phone died. What'd he say?

1:10:43.573 --> 1:10:46.199
They pushed up the
launch because of the weather.

1:10:46.326 --> 1:10:49.285
Um, they want us back
before it gets too rough.

1:10:55.460 --> 1:10:57.368
Are you sure
you're okay?

1:10:57.462 --> 1:10:59.254
Not really,
I was already nervous,

1:10:59.339 --> 1:11:01.923
and, uh, now there's a chance
of bad weather.

1:11:02.008 --> 1:11:04.884
So? What?

1:11:05.011 --> 1:11:07.512
I have
too many bad memories.

1:11:09.849 --> 1:11:12.883
My mother died on a boat
when I was a kid.

1:11:12.978 --> 1:11:17.054
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry, I didn't know.

1:11:17.148 --> 1:11:21.776
This'll be the first time
I've been on a boat since then.

1:11:21.861 --> 1:11:25.363
Well, I'll be right there
with you today, okay?

1:11:27.117 --> 1:11:29.075
I really appreciate it.

1:11:29.202 --> 1:11:32.245
I got you. You're gonna be okay.

1:11:38.545 --> 1:11:39.919
Hello?

1:11:40.839 --> 1:11:42.213
Ladies?

1:11:43.842 --> 1:11:46.926
Captain Spinks? Huh.

1:11:47.053 --> 1:11:48.803
-You good?
-Yeah.

1:11:53.184 --> 1:11:55.059
Are you sure
you got the time right?

1:11:55.145 --> 1:11:57.928
Captain Spinks usually meets us
with champagne as we board.

1:11:58.023 --> 1:12:00.315
I think so.
Should we call Elizabeth?

1:12:01.818 --> 1:12:03.318
Hello?

1:12:05.947 --> 1:12:09.282
Maybe they rescheduled,
somewhere on land.

1:12:09.409 --> 1:12:11.951
Or maybe
they're just downstairs.

1:12:12.078 --> 1:12:13.778
Listen, I know you're nervous,

1:12:13.872 --> 1:12:16.447
but you are gonna have
a great time.

1:12:16.541 --> 1:12:19.709
-Okay? Yeah?
-Okay. Mm. Yeah.

1:12:22.422 --> 1:12:24.714
You're gonna be okay?

1:12:24.799 --> 1:12:26.758
I'm sorry, I think I may need
to lie down for a minute.

1:12:26.843 --> 1:12:29.635
Of course. Don't apologize,
okay? Follow me.

1:12:30.555 --> 1:12:32.263
Slowly.

1:12:34.142 --> 1:12:35.224
Careful.

1:12:36.853 --> 1:12:39.312
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Breathe. It's okay.

1:12:50.158 --> 1:12:52.575
All right, here you go.

1:12:54.454 --> 1:12:55.912
Bathroom's right in there, okay?

1:12:55.997 --> 1:12:58.664
-Um, thank you. I appreciate it.
-Of course.

1:12:58.792 --> 1:13:01.492
Just don't hibernate in here
too long, okay?

1:13:01.586 --> 1:13:03.795
-Deal.
-I'll get the champagne ready.

1:13:27.612 --> 1:13:29.987
Vanessa? Are you okay?

1:13:31.950 --> 1:13:34.617
Hello? Let me out!

1:13:34.702 --> 1:13:36.160
Open this door!

1:13:41.167 --> 1:13:45.369
Jesse. Jesse, Jesse.
Are you okay?

1:13:45.463 --> 1:13:47.130
Hang on, Jesse, I'll get help.

1:14:09.779 --> 1:14:10.862
Okay.

1:14:15.326 --> 1:14:17.368
Come on.

1:14:17.454 --> 1:14:18.619
Come on.

1:14:21.291 --> 1:14:23.916
Come on. Please.

1:14:24.043 --> 1:14:25.543
Please, please, please. Come on.

1:14:40.185 --> 1:14:41.392
Sylvia.

1:14:48.193 --> 1:14:49.192
Sylvia.

1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:51.769
Are you okay?

1:14:51.863 --> 1:14:53.154
Get my phone,
it's under the couch.

1:14:53.239 --> 1:14:55.615
There's no service here.

1:14:55.742 --> 1:14:57.033
He's coming.

1:15:12.884 --> 1:15:15.793
Well, you look snug as a bug
in a rug.

1:15:15.887 --> 1:15:17.461
Well, we're just about
to, uh, depart,

1:15:17.555 --> 1:15:19.764
so I'm gonna go
let our other passenger know.

1:15:19.849 --> 1:15:23.559
She is gonna be so surprised
to see daddy.

1:15:31.694 --> 1:15:33.528
He's your father?

1:15:33.613 --> 1:15:35.404
Long story. I'll be right back.

1:15:35.490 --> 1:15:37.198
Please be careful.

1:15:57.262 --> 1:15:59.011
Now, where did you go?

1:16:01.599 --> 1:16:03.182
Well, at least
you're still there.

1:16:03.309 --> 1:16:05.676
Now, where's she hidin'?

1:16:05.770 --> 1:16:08.729
Not gonna tell me?
It's all right.

1:16:08.815 --> 1:16:10.398
I'll find her myself.

1:16:12.735 --> 1:16:15.152
Sylvia!

1:16:20.493 --> 1:16:21.867
-Did you call for help?
-I couldn't.

1:16:21.995 --> 1:16:23.953
-He smashed the radio.
-Hand me my phone.

1:16:24.038 --> 1:16:25.621
Check for reception up here.

1:16:25.707 --> 1:16:28.374
Sylvia, watch out! Sylvia!

1:16:47.979 --> 1:16:49.979
Oh. We're moving.

1:16:51.482 --> 1:16:53.691
-Ah, you're awake.
-Oh.

1:16:53.776 --> 1:16:54.942
I was afraid you were gonna
sleep through

1:16:55.028 --> 1:16:56.060
our whole father-daughter trip.

1:16:56.154 --> 1:16:57.653
Dad, what is this all about?

1:16:57.739 --> 1:16:59.229
This is about me reclaiming

1:16:59.324 --> 1:17:01.157
my place in rightful society.

1:17:01.242 --> 1:17:02.950
-I don't understand.
-Oh, sweetheart.

1:17:03.036 --> 1:17:05.369
You don't have to understand,
all you have to do is just

1:17:05.455 --> 1:17:07.955
enjoy the fireworks
at the end of the celebration.

1:17:11.836 --> 1:17:14.587
Dad, please, dad.

1:17:14.714 --> 1:17:15.838
Dad.

1:17:18.176 --> 1:17:21.093
You know, after your little
prank yesterday in the park,

1:17:21.220 --> 1:17:24.138
I realized
that you figured it out somehow.

1:17:25.350 --> 1:17:27.683
I'm not your dad.

1:17:27.769 --> 1:17:30.811
So it's true then.
Who's my father?

1:17:33.316 --> 1:17:36.651
He was a loser.
He ran out on you mother.

1:17:36.736 --> 1:17:40.446
And I agreed to raise you if she
could just leave him behind.

1:17:41.532 --> 1:17:42.940
She just couldn't forget him.

1:17:43.034 --> 1:17:44.942
She was gonna tell you
everything.

1:17:45.036 --> 1:17:46.777
I couldn't let that happen.

1:17:46.871 --> 1:17:50.614
I'd already lost everything,
I lost my career,

1:17:50.708 --> 1:17:54.710
I lost my dignity,
my self-respect.

1:17:54.796 --> 1:17:56.462
I raised his little brat,
and he was

1:17:56.589 --> 1:17:57.788
coming back to take your mother?

1:17:57.882 --> 1:17:58.756
What are you talking about?

1:17:58.841 --> 1:17:59.965
Your dad decided

1:18:00.093 --> 1:18:01.792
he finally wanted to meet you,

1:18:01.886 --> 1:18:03.886
after all those years.

1:18:03.971 --> 1:18:06.430
But I knew what he was
really after. I knew.

1:18:06.516 --> 1:18:09.809
So I tricked him, I got him to
go out on the boat, I told him,

1:18:09.936 --> 1:18:12.103
I told him
we needed to talk things out.

1:18:13.564 --> 1:18:17.141
And then... I pushed him over

1:18:17.235 --> 1:18:20.144
right before I sank the boat.

1:18:20.238 --> 1:18:22.405
You know,
they never found his body.

1:18:23.741 --> 1:18:25.816
Your mother, she, uh,

1:18:25.910 --> 1:18:27.076
she must have tried
to swim to shore.

1:18:27.161 --> 1:18:29.537
-I knew it was you!
-I loved her!

1:18:29.622 --> 1:18:31.497
This is why you kicked me out,
I'd always thought

1:18:31.624 --> 1:18:32.823
it was because
of the insurance money.

1:18:32.917 --> 1:18:35.960
Insurance money? Are you...

1:18:36.045 --> 1:18:39.163
Your mother took out loans
for your dreams.

1:18:39.257 --> 1:18:41.498
What about my dreams?

1:18:41.592 --> 1:18:43.342
I could've made my mark
in this world.

1:18:43.469 --> 1:18:45.836
I could've,
I could've been somebody.

1:18:45.930 --> 1:18:48.338
And instead,
I was reduced to cheating,

1:18:48.433 --> 1:18:50.850
stealing, just to scrape by.

1:18:52.270 --> 1:18:53.677
That's where
I met your friend Becca.

1:18:53.771 --> 1:18:55.771
What does this have to do
with Becca?

1:18:58.735 --> 1:19:00.651
Yeah, see, I met, uh...

1:19:01.904 --> 1:19:04.071
I met Becca in Vegas...

1:19:06.451 --> 1:19:08.701
and I figured, well,

1:19:08.828 --> 1:19:12.121
sooner or later
she's gonna remember me.

1:19:12.206 --> 1:19:14.364
So, uh...

1:19:14.459 --> 1:19:16.700
-I just made it sooner.
-Stop, stop.

1:19:16.794 --> 1:19:18.368
You took everything from me.

1:19:18.463 --> 1:19:20.871
You wouldn't be anything
without me.

1:19:20.965 --> 1:19:23.132
And today's the day
that you're gonna pay.

1:19:23.217 --> 1:19:24.717
What the hell are you doing?

1:19:24.844 --> 1:19:26.376
-You won't get away with this.
-Put that down!

1:19:26.471 --> 1:19:27.762
The entire FIL knows
what you've done!

1:19:31.434 --> 1:19:36.353
Sylvie, Sylvie, Sylvie,
come on. Put that thing down.

1:19:36.439 --> 1:19:40.057
You don't have the guts
to kill me. It's not in you.

1:19:40.151 --> 1:19:42.943
You're not a killer.
You make jewelry.

1:19:51.954 --> 1:19:53.204
Earl!

1:20:02.507 --> 1:20:04.256
Sylvia, be careful.

1:20:07.637 --> 1:20:10.087
Captain Spinks
is not answering my calls.

1:20:10.181 --> 1:20:11.764
I spoke to him last night.

1:20:11.891 --> 1:20:13.974
He assured me
everything was in order.

1:20:14.060 --> 1:20:17.094
Should I call and let everyone
know the trip is canceled?

1:20:17.188 --> 1:20:21.440
Yes, it's pretty clear
we're not going anywhere today.

1:20:25.029 --> 1:20:26.737
-Hey. -Today's the day that you're...

1:20:26.823 --> 1:20:29.606
Are you... Sylvia
and Vanessa are in danger?

1:20:29.700 --> 1:20:32.776
-You know, Sylvia--
-Earl, it's time to stop!

1:20:32.870 --> 1:20:34.778
You just made me realize
you're not gonna ride off

1:20:34.872 --> 1:20:37.164
into the sunset without me.

1:20:37.250 --> 1:20:39.750
Tell you what, let's just watch
the fireworks together.

1:20:39.836 --> 1:20:42.419
-What do you say?
-Stop.

1:20:42.505 --> 1:20:44.547
What a lovely way to die!

1:21:08.197 --> 1:21:09.613
Earl!

1:21:32.388 --> 1:21:33.470
Dad...

1:21:38.644 --> 1:21:41.061
I just can't stop looking at it.

1:21:42.690 --> 1:21:44.940
Corey did a beautiful job.

1:21:45.026 --> 1:21:47.943
I really think he's gonna go far
as a jewelry designer.

1:21:48.029 --> 1:21:50.613
I can't wait to show Luke.

1:21:50.698 --> 1:21:53.023
Was Corey surprised
about the promotion?

1:21:53.117 --> 1:21:55.868
Yes, and I'm surprised
by how much I'm enjoying

1:21:55.995 --> 1:21:59.788
the extra time
with you and the FIL.

1:22:00.458 --> 1:22:01.874
And Noah.

1:22:03.502 --> 1:22:07.338
-I'm seeing him again tonight.
-Huh?

1:22:07.423 --> 1:22:09.206
Do you have anything
you wanna say to me?

1:22:09.300 --> 1:22:12.376
You were right, Claire.
He's perfect for me.

1:22:12.470 --> 1:22:16.347
-And you knew it all along.
-Oh. Come here.

1:22:17.892 --> 1:22:19.016
Mm...

1:22:23.105 --> 1:22:24.188
Mm...

1:22:26.859 --> 1:22:31.111
-Can you believe it?
-Ah, it's a dream come true.

1:22:31.197 --> 1:22:33.781
All the members are loving
Lush Designs' fabulous new app.

1:22:33.866 --> 1:22:36.900
Thankfully,
with Jesse behind bars,

1:22:36.994 --> 1:22:40.704
it was a simple task to get all
of the members complete access

1:22:40.790 --> 1:22:43.407
to the most talented
jewelry designer I know.

1:22:43.501 --> 1:22:44.908
I bet all the members
will be wearing

1:22:45.002 --> 1:22:46.877
your designs
at the next meeting.

1:22:46.963 --> 1:22:49.755
Well, I can't think of a better
place to debut the app than here

1:22:49.882 --> 1:22:51.590
where our partnership started.

1:22:51.717 --> 1:22:56.512
It was a wonderful gesture
to donate tonight's proceeds

1:22:56.597 --> 1:23:00.090
to the Becca Brown Design Studio
for Teens.

1:23:00.184 --> 1:23:02.592
Becca would've loved that.
To Becca.

1:23:02.687 --> 1:23:04.395
-Yes.

1:23:06.190 --> 1:23:09.274
Hey, I hear
someone has a blind date later.

1:23:11.362 --> 1:23:15.772
Well, it worked out so well
for Sylvia, so...

1:23:15.866 --> 1:23:17.324
To lasting friendships

1:23:17.410 --> 1:23:21.328
and powerful women
who help each other.

1:23:21.414 --> 1:23:23.280
-Cheers to that.
-All right, bring it in.

1:23:23.374 --> 1:23:26.208
Bring it in, bring it in.
Come here.
