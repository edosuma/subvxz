00:55.600 --> 00:56.481
Hi.

01:30.012 --> 01:32.981
<i>Linda Sinclair
had reached her 45th year,</i>

01:32.983 --> 01:35.183
<i>an unwed high school
English teacher,</i>

01:35.185 --> 01:37.786
<i>with no prospect of marriage.</i>

01:37.788 --> 01:42.657
<i>Hers appeared to be
a rather ordinary life,</i>

01:42.659 --> 01:45.127
<i>one of discipline...</i>

01:45.129 --> 01:46.395
I have these.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.930
<i>Frugality...</i>

01:48.932 --> 01:50.665
<i>Small indignities...</i>

01:53.837 --> 01:55.471
<i>Modest hopes...</i>

01:57.775 --> 01:59.876
I'm all right.

01:59.878 --> 02:02.344
Daddy! Over here!

02:02.346 --> 02:04.480
<i>- And disappointments.
- Oh, dear.</i>

02:06.015 --> 02:08.817
<i>She lived alone
in Kingston, Pennsylvania,</i>

02:08.818 --> 02:11.119
<i>not far from
where she was born.</i>

02:13.156 --> 02:16.359
<i>She enjoyed no great luxuries.</i>

02:16.361 --> 02:19.462
<i>Preferring instead
the simple pleasures.</i>

02:19.464 --> 02:23.099
<i>And though her life
may sound cold and dull,</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:28.003
<i>let me assure you that Ms. Linda
Sinclair was neither.</i>

02:28.005 --> 02:30.240
<i>She was a passionate woman.</i>

02:30.242 --> 02:31.875
<i>A romantic.</i>

02:32.777 --> 02:34.978
<i>That was why she was alone,</i>

02:34.980 --> 02:37.881
<i>for she had always been alone.</i>

02:39.350 --> 02:41.186
<i>As a sensitive child,</i>

02:41.188 --> 02:44.722
<i>Linda found her sanctuary
in literature.</i>

02:44.724 --> 02:47.258
<i>The great works stirred
in her an excitement,</i>

02:47.260 --> 02:49.060
<i>an irrepressible thrill</i>

02:49.062 --> 02:52.329
<i>that made the mundane world
seem all the more bleak.</i>

02:52.331 --> 02:54.399
All right, come on.
Hustle! Hustle!

02:54.401 --> 02:57.969
<i>She saw no reason to take
part in childish pursuits.</i>

03:01.874 --> 03:07.012
<i>And her little interest in
the banal activities of youth,</i>

03:07.014 --> 03:09.048
<i>her high-minded sensibility</i>

03:09.050 --> 03:11.116
<i>guided Linda to her
life's purpose.</i>

03:11.118 --> 03:12.818
I thought you said she was
going to the library.

03:12.820 --> 03:13.953
No. No, she sucks...

03:15.754 --> 03:18.524
<i>She would devote herself
to igniting the flames...</i>

03:18.526 --> 03:19.825
Hi, Joanna.

03:19.827 --> 03:22.895
<i>Of literary passion
in young minds.</i>

03:23.964 --> 03:26.165
<i>She nurtured their ideals...</i>

03:26.167 --> 03:28.067
How do communities
approach change

03:28.069 --> 03:29.768
when promoted
by the individual?

03:29.770 --> 03:31.838
<i>Valued their opinions.</i>

03:31.840 --> 03:33.241
Melissa.

03:33.243 --> 03:35.443
<i>They adored her.</i>

03:35.445 --> 03:37.911
<i>But her uncompromising spirit,</i>

03:37.913 --> 03:39.913
<i>so beloved in the classroom</i>

03:39.915 --> 03:42.182
<i>doomed her
to a spinster's life.</i>

03:42.184 --> 03:43.317
Linda?

03:43.319 --> 03:46.487
- Hi.
- Hello. I'm Don. It's so nice to meet you.

03:46.489 --> 03:47.788
- You too.
- Sorry.

03:47.790 --> 03:49.957
Oh, it's okay.

03:49.959 --> 03:52.126
I... Well, you ordered
without me...

03:52.128 --> 03:53.828
I'm... I'm sorry.

03:53.830 --> 03:57.332
No, I wasn't really offended.
I was just making a joke.

03:57.334 --> 03:59.835
<i>For how could she be a
model to her students,</i>

03:59.837 --> 04:02.069
<i>if she settled
for just any man?</i>

04:02.071 --> 04:03.371
Now I'm unemployed.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.574
And that's actually...
It's kinda great.

04:06.576 --> 04:11.045
I have a lot of time,
I stopped drinking ice.

04:11.047 --> 04:13.814
I grew a mustache. And...

04:13.816 --> 04:16.216
When I was divorced this whole
patch just fell right into place.

04:16.219 --> 04:19.120
And I feel like I'm me now.

04:19.122 --> 04:22.157
And... I might have some ice,
actually. Could I...

04:22.159 --> 04:25.226
<i>She longed for a sensitive,
thoughtful man.</i>

04:25.228 --> 04:28.229
Do you really need to make
35-40,000 dollars a year

04:28.231 --> 04:30.231
with no chance of being fired,

04:30.233 --> 04:33.835
just to teach some kids how to clap
their hands and run around in a circle?

04:33.837 --> 04:37.106
I mean, physical education, that ought
to be up to the parents, right?

04:37.108 --> 04:39.208
So what do you
teach again? French?

04:39.210 --> 04:41.945
<i>Someone mature,
and soft-spoken.</i>

04:41.947 --> 04:44.147
Your system
doesn't work, Linda.

04:44.149 --> 04:46.884
It's gasping for air.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.618
And you know what...

04:48.620 --> 04:51.588
Let it die.
This is common sense... Hi.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.189
Thanks.

04:53.191 --> 04:54.424
Do you mind getting this one?

04:54.426 --> 04:56.559
'Cause I'm a little
short on cash.

04:56.561 --> 05:00.631
In the end, Linda gave
up on men altogether.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.133
Why can't we get back
to, like, the Indian days...

05:03.135 --> 05:04.635
You know, "You give me
a piece of corn..."

05:04.637 --> 05:08.005
<i>She loved her work,
she earned her keep.</i>

05:08.007 --> 05:10.041
Debate! Debate! Debate!

05:10.043 --> 05:12.009
<i>That was enough.</i>

05:12.011 --> 05:13.344
What a country...

05:13.346 --> 05:16.080
<i>And if there was a tragic air</i>

05:16.842 --> 05:19.822
<i>about our stoic
Ms. Sinclair, so be it.</i>

05:20.019 --> 05:23.888
<i>If literature had
taught her anything,</i>

05:23.890 --> 05:29.027
<i>it was that the true romantic
is always alone.</i>

05:29.029 --> 05:31.329
<i>And must ever be on guard</i>

05:31.331 --> 05:33.298
<i>against a dangerous world.</i>

05:36.569 --> 05:38.037
Hey.

05:38.039 --> 05:40.272
Fuck!

05:40.274 --> 05:44.543
It's me! Jason Sherwood!
I was in your class in 2006...

05:44.545 --> 05:47.314
Jason Sherwood?

05:47.316 --> 05:50.050
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

05:50.052 --> 05:52.152
I thought you lived
in New York.

05:52.154 --> 05:54.621
No, I don't anymore...

05:54.623 --> 05:58.591
Oh. Oh, my gosh...
I am so sorry. Oh...

05:58.593 --> 05:59.993
Let me take
you to the hospital.

05:59.995 --> 06:01.328
- No. I'm fine...
- Jason, I insist.

06:01.330 --> 06:02.929
We have to take you
to the emergency room...

06:02.931 --> 06:04.931
No, no, no... Jesus, please,
no, no, no. no.

06:04.933 --> 06:06.600
It's fine. I'm fine.
I'm sorry...

06:06.602 --> 06:08.635
My dad,
he works at the hospital

06:08.637 --> 06:10.537
- and I'd really rather not see him.
- Okay, okay.

06:10.539 --> 06:12.306
Then let's get
you home, all right.

06:12.308 --> 06:14.008
God, that burns like a fuck!

06:14.010 --> 06:15.677
- It burned my face!
- I know. I'm so sorry...

06:15.679 --> 06:18.312
I'm so sorry... Come on,
my car is right over here.

06:18.314 --> 06:21.280
Oh, Jesus... Who uses pepper spray
in Kingston?

06:29.424 --> 06:31.525
You know, I have a clean towel
in the trunk,

06:31.527 --> 06:33.593
- I could get that for you.
- No that's okay.

06:33.595 --> 06:35.095
This is working fine.

06:35.097 --> 06:36.631
I am so, so sorry.

06:36.633 --> 06:38.166
Oh, don't be sorry.

06:38.168 --> 06:40.069
It's my fault, I shouldn't have
startled you like that.

06:40.071 --> 06:41.503
No, no, you were
just being friendly,

06:41.505 --> 06:43.604
I should have
recognized you right away.

06:43.606 --> 06:47.341
Jason Sherwood. What are you doing
back here in Kingston, Pennsylvania?

06:47.343 --> 06:49.278
I thought you'd be tearing
up Broadway by now!

06:49.280 --> 06:53.215
Well, you know,
it's only a matter of time.

06:53.217 --> 06:56.151
You were one of the best writers
I've ever had in my class.

06:56.153 --> 06:57.352
That's nice.

06:57.354 --> 07:01.424
The last I heard you were in
the playwriting program in NYU.

07:01.426 --> 07:02.559
Is that right?

07:02.561 --> 07:04.160
Dramatic Writing.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.261
Yeah, I got my degree
a couple of years ago.

07:06.263 --> 07:09.131
And? Don't keep me in suspense.

07:09.133 --> 07:10.566
And nothing.

07:10.568 --> 07:12.201
That's it.
I'm done with writing.

07:12.203 --> 07:14.204
What? What do you mean?

07:14.206 --> 07:15.705
I mean, I'm finished.

07:15.707 --> 07:19.075
I wrote my thesis play.
But that took me forever...

07:19.077 --> 07:20.410
But I don't know,
I really believed in it.

07:20.412 --> 07:22.345
Well, of course you did.
What happened?

07:22.347 --> 07:24.047
I tried to get it produced.

07:24.049 --> 07:27.084
And used every resource
I had just to get it read.

07:27.086 --> 07:31.387
Here, you can just keep going straight.
I'm staying with my dad.

07:31.389 --> 07:34.524
- For now.
- Well, what does he think of all of this?

07:34.526 --> 07:36.793
Well. You don't
really know my dad...

07:36.795 --> 07:38.796
Oh, I do, a little.
He goes to my gym.

07:38.798 --> 07:41.298
That's funny.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.335
Well, he said I should
go to law school.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.603
- Oh, no...
- Yeah.

07:44.605 --> 07:46.304
So I'm probably gonna do that.

07:46.306 --> 07:47.672
Oh, Jason...

07:47.674 --> 07:49.441
I can't write.

07:49.443 --> 07:51.577
Honestly, it makes me
physically ill.

07:51.579 --> 07:55.447
And besides, I have to do something,
and law school's something.

07:55.449 --> 07:58.316
You can make a left
at the next block.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.321
Right here.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.758
Home sweet home. Thank you.

08:06.693 --> 08:08.461
I am so sorry.

08:08.463 --> 08:10.563
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

08:13.066 --> 08:15.469
Jason, if I can do anything to help,
you know...

08:15.471 --> 08:18.337
I'd love to read
your play at least.

08:18.339 --> 08:19.539
Yeah, sure.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.341
I could drop it by school.

08:22.343 --> 08:24.377
- All right.
- Yeah?

08:24.379 --> 08:26.445
Okay. Bye, Ms. Sinclair.
Thank you.

08:26.447 --> 08:27.614
Bye.

08:34.221 --> 08:36.255
Thanks.

08:38.091 --> 08:41.092
<i>It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.</i>

08:41.095 --> 08:45.097
<i>It was time
to hand in your quizzes.</i>

08:45.099 --> 08:51.238
So now that I know that you've
all finished A Tale of Two Cities,

08:51.240 --> 08:54.175
<i>let's talk about
Sydney Carton's death.</i>

08:54.177 --> 08:56.511
Now why would he switch places

08:56.513 --> 08:59.380
with a man condemned
to the guillotine?

08:59.382 --> 09:01.916
Why does he sacrifice himself?

09:04.253 --> 09:05.787
Fallon.

09:05.789 --> 09:07.655
I think it's really cool,
you know.

09:07.657 --> 09:09.390
'Cause he does it for Lucie.

09:09.392 --> 09:12.293
Even though she married another guy,
he still loves her so much

09:12.295 --> 09:14.229
that he'll die
to save her husband.

09:14.231 --> 09:17.600
It's... It's totally unselfish.

09:17.602 --> 09:19.802
Very nice. Yes?

09:19.804 --> 09:21.770
Ms. Sinclair? Have you
ever written anything?

09:21.772 --> 09:23.806
Like a novel or a play
or something?

09:23.808 --> 09:27.141
No. No, I'm not a writer.

09:27.143 --> 09:29.879
I'm a reader.
And we need plenty of those.

09:29.881 --> 09:32.248
I think it is
only a true artist

09:32.250 --> 09:34.683
who can give voice
to the human experience.

09:36.554 --> 09:41.424
I'm sorry, but if Dickens
was such an artist,

09:41.426 --> 09:43.326
couldn't he come up
with an ending

09:43.328 --> 09:45.896
where this guy doesn't
have to kill himself?

09:45.898 --> 09:47.731
I think you're
missing the point.

09:47.733 --> 09:51.334
Sydney Carton's death is,
as Fallon said, a selfless act.

09:51.336 --> 09:53.838
The only satisfaction
he receives is knowing.

09:53.840 --> 09:58.442
Now this is something that people
understood in Dickens' time.

09:58.444 --> 10:01.612
Today we've lost touch
with classical virtues,

10:01.614 --> 10:05.249
like honor, selfless action,

10:05.251 --> 10:08.754
the purity of a love
that asks for no reward...

10:09.856 --> 10:11.323
Hi!

10:11.325 --> 10:13.291
- Oh, my goodness.
- Sorry to interrupt.

10:13.293 --> 10:15.192
- No, no, no. Come on in.
- No, no, no...

10:15.194 --> 10:16.694
Everyone's gonna be
so excited to meet you.

10:16.696 --> 10:17.862
- No, no, no.
- Please, please. No.

10:17.864 --> 10:20.499
Class, I have
a surprise for you.

10:20.501 --> 10:23.902
This is Jason Sherwood.
He's a former student,

10:23.904 --> 10:28.507
and a graduate of the Dramatic Writing
Program at NYU.

10:28.509 --> 10:32.211
And I'm sure many of you remember
reading his wonderful story,

10:32.213 --> 10:33.479
The Hidden Court.

10:35.349 --> 10:36.782
Sorry about that.

10:36.784 --> 10:38.483
I just came to drop this off...

10:38.485 --> 10:40.319
That's terrific.
Thank you so much.

10:40.321 --> 10:42.887
- You're welcome to join us.
- Oh, no, I'm okay.

10:42.889 --> 10:45.557
I'm just gonna go.

10:45.559 --> 10:47.893
You guys should feel very lucky to have
Ms. Sinclair as a teacher.

10:47.895 --> 10:50.897
I had many genius
writing teachers at NYU,

10:50.899 --> 10:52.598
and she's up there
with the best.

10:55.235 --> 10:57.438
Thank you.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.905
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

11:00.808 --> 11:03.609
Okay, I admit it.
I bribed him to say that.

11:04.746 --> 11:07.080
All right, Noble Sacrifice.

11:22.030 --> 11:23.897
- Dr. Sherwood!
- Yeah.

11:23.899 --> 11:25.933
I saw your son today.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.502
I'm Linda Sinclair.

11:28.504 --> 11:30.337
- I was Jason's English teacher...
- Yeah, I know who you are.

11:30.339 --> 11:32.373
Yeah, Jason's back home.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.609
He told me all about New York.
It's very sad.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.480
You know, I think he just reached a point
where he felt like he had to stop

11:38.482 --> 11:40.548
and take stock of things.
It's very normal.

11:40.550 --> 11:42.817
But it would be such a shame for him
to give up his writing.

11:42.819 --> 11:44.685
Because he's so very talented.

11:44.687 --> 11:47.422
Yeah. But that's a very,
very tough racket, you know.

11:47.424 --> 11:48.957
Not everyone's cut out for it.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.693
I'm excited to read his play.

11:51.695 --> 11:53.295
- He showed you his play?
- Yes.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.097
I'm very excited to read it.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.934
- I hope you like it.
- Well, I'm sure I will.

11:57.936 --> 11:59.703
Did you like it?

12:00.838 --> 12:03.573
I can't exactly say
it was my thing.

12:05.009 --> 12:06.843
- Nice to see you, Mrs...
- Miss.

12:06.845 --> 12:08.577
Miss Sinclair.

12:10.715 --> 12:12.516
Ms. Sinclair.

12:12.518 --> 12:13.784
Right.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.670
- Hello?
- I'm calling from the...

12:33.672 --> 12:36.874
No, thank you. And please
take me off your list.

12:36.876 --> 12:38.810
- This will only take a second.
- Thank you very much.

12:38.812 --> 12:40.078
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am?</i>

12:44.001 --> 12:50.340
<i>"Ms Sinclair, for what is worth,
here's 'The Crysalis.' Jason."</i>

13:27.662 --> 13:32.432
Jason? It's Linda Sinclair.
Did I wake you?

13:32.434 --> 13:34.934
What? No. No, no, no, no. Hi.

13:34.936 --> 13:36.136
Hi.

13:36.138 --> 13:38.539
How are you? What's up?

13:38.541 --> 13:40.874
<i>Well, I read the play.</i>

13:40.876 --> 13:42.742
You did?

13:42.744 --> 13:44.677
And it's fantastic!

13:44.679 --> 13:46.779
<i>You like it?</i>

13:46.781 --> 13:48.682
I loved it!

13:48.684 --> 13:52.086
It's remarkable, I've been
crying for the last half hour.

13:52.088 --> 13:53.554
You have?

13:53.974 --> 13:55.713
Are you kidding,
with that ending, I mean,

13:56.305 --> 13:59.064
how can you even think about
law school, you belong in New York.

13:59.462 --> 14:01.063
That's so nice of you to say.

14:01.065 --> 14:02.965
<i>No, no.</i>

14:02.967 --> 14:05.200
I'm not being nice.
I'm being honest.

14:05.202 --> 14:08.003
And I can't bear the thought that
no one's gonna get to see this.

14:08.972 --> 14:13.576
Yeah, me too. I mean, that's just
the way it is though.

14:13.578 --> 14:15.978
<i>You know,
it's fine, you know...</i>

14:17.214 --> 14:19.048
I'll be a lawyer.

14:19.050 --> 14:21.951
I just... I have to let it go.

14:21.953 --> 14:25.588
But what if there were
a way to get it produced.

14:25.590 --> 14:26.622
Right now.

14:26.624 --> 14:27.990
Would you be
interested in that?

14:30.060 --> 14:31.594
I mean, honestly,
there isn't...

14:31.596 --> 14:34.230
- Because...
- Do you remember Carl Kapinas?

14:34.232 --> 14:36.966
Mr. Ka-penis,
the drama teacher?

14:36.968 --> 14:39.236
<i>Jason, please, he's a friend.</i>

14:39.238 --> 14:41.071
Sorry. Kapinas.

14:41.073 --> 14:43.040
<i>Well, he's always
complaining about</i>

14:43.042 --> 14:46.610
having to direct the same show
year after year

14:46.612 --> 14:48.879
and I wanna give him
The Chrysalis.

14:48.881 --> 14:51.481
<i>Yeah, well, I'm...</i>

14:51.483 --> 14:54.785
<i>I'm not sure really how I feel
about that exactly.</i>

14:54.787 --> 14:57.888
<i>Because if he flips for it,
like I know he will...</i>

14:57.890 --> 15:01.059
<i>There's a very real chance that he
could mount a production of it.</i>

15:03.796 --> 15:05.964
<i>You mean at the high school?</i>

15:06.966 --> 15:08.633
God damn it.

15:08.635 --> 15:11.288
<i>- With him directing?
- That's right.</i>

15:11.323 --> 15:16.507
<i>He can come on a little strong,
but say what you will,</i>

15:16.509 --> 15:18.776
<i>the man understands drama.</i>

15:18.778 --> 15:20.645
Linda, are you in there?

15:20.647 --> 15:22.146
Lin... Sorry.

15:24.516 --> 15:26.551
- Linda?
- Carl.

15:26.553 --> 15:31.590
I can't wait. I've just had the most
transcendent experience!

15:31.592 --> 15:33.092
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah, I heard you. I heard you.

15:33.094 --> 15:34.827
- Hurry!
- Okay.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.229
Oh, Linda... Linda...

15:38.231 --> 15:40.065
- You liked it?
- Liked it?

15:40.067 --> 15:41.634
It's my story.

15:41.636 --> 15:42.835
The boy wrote it for me.

15:42.837 --> 15:44.937
I know! I felt
exactly the same way!

15:44.939 --> 15:46.972
Naturally.
The tale is archetypal,

15:46.974 --> 15:48.774
and thus universal in its appeal.

15:48.776 --> 15:51.076
- Of course.
- But it's so extraordinary.

15:51.078 --> 15:53.013
I feel I've been transformed...

15:53.015 --> 15:55.081
Wait... We should use
that for the posters.

15:55.083 --> 15:59.118
"The Chrysalis will transform you."
Period. "Forever."

15:59.120 --> 16:00.819
Exclamation point.

16:00.821 --> 16:02.688
Linda, I'll do such
fantastic things with it.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.691
I see it all
so clearly up here.

16:04.693 --> 16:06.927
For the design,
I'm picturing a sort of

16:06.929 --> 16:09.930
Neo-Edwardian-German-
Expressionist gestalt.

16:09.932 --> 16:11.599
But colorful and fun.

16:11.601 --> 16:15.169
- Halle Anderson would make an ideal lead.
- Oh, yes.

16:15.171 --> 16:18.573
And Sheila Nussbaum
as the Irish stepmother.

16:18.575 --> 16:20.309
She excels at dialect.

16:20.311 --> 16:24.645
I've harvested a bountiful and
talented crop of actors this year!

16:24.647 --> 16:26.714
Do you really
think we can do it?

16:26.716 --> 16:28.949
Oh, we can. And we must.

16:30.219 --> 16:31.720
Don't you see?

16:31.722 --> 16:33.722
I've become an artistic zombie,

16:33.724 --> 16:36.024
walking lifelessly through
the same old productions

16:36.026 --> 16:38.193
year after year after year.

16:38.195 --> 16:40.629
I'm supposed to direct
The Importance of Being Earnest

16:40.631 --> 16:42.765
this semester
for the fifth time.

16:42.767 --> 16:45.101
Try breathing life into
that antiquated sitcom.

16:45.103 --> 16:46.868
And how can I,
after reading this play?

16:46.870 --> 16:50.072
This is O'Neill meets Kafka
meets Spielberg

16:50.074 --> 16:51.773
and then they all
walk into a bar.

16:51.775 --> 16:54.944
It's fresh! It's new! It's...

16:54.946 --> 16:56.346
It's not gonna happen, people.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.915
And why is that, Phil?

16:58.917 --> 17:01.617
Because this is not
a high school play, Carl!

17:01.619 --> 17:04.287
What do you know about what is
and isn't a high school play?

17:04.289 --> 17:06.825
I've done 38 productions.

17:06.827 --> 17:08.726
Thirty-eight over 19 years!

17:08.728 --> 17:10.127
I believe
I'm the authority here.

17:10.128 --> 17:12.095
- No one is questioning your authority.
- Oh, yeah.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.030
- All Phil is saying...
- Phil would be happy

17:14.031 --> 17:16.199
if we put on Our Town
twice a year.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.734
Sue me, I like Our Town.
I think it's wholesome.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.804
- Everybody likes it.
- I... Just for me...

17:20.806 --> 17:26.175
I thought we were doing The Importance
of Being Earnest as the play.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.311
Trudie, if I have to spend
another two months

17:28.314 --> 17:30.347
making trays
of cucumber sandwiches,

17:30.349 --> 17:33.016
I will curl into a fetal
position and die.

17:33.018 --> 17:38.255
Like that time you did Oklahoma
with those idiotic masks.

17:38.257 --> 17:41.425
It was in the traditional
Japanese Noh style,

17:41.427 --> 17:46.898
And Lydia Plotke at the Times Leader called
it "profoundly imaginative."

17:46.900 --> 17:48.733
Yeah, well, I thought
it profoundly stank.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.202
This from a man who thinks
American Buffalo

17:51.204 --> 17:53.961
- is about an American buffalo.
- That's what it's called!

17:53.996 --> 17:56.074
Well, in the words of
David Mamet, "Fuck you!"

17:56.076 --> 17:57.876
Hey, ya, pal!

17:57.878 --> 17:59.377
Now time out!

17:59.379 --> 18:01.679
Now just dial it down a notch.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.214
I'm sorry.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.549
Accepted.

18:05.751 --> 18:09.289
Now as for this play,
The Chrysalis.

18:09.291 --> 18:12.826
You know, I am impressed by what
this alumnus has written,

18:12.828 --> 18:14.694
but I have to wonder...

18:14.696 --> 18:17.798
You know, is it appropriate for
a high school audience?

18:17.800 --> 18:19.098
- Yes.
- Right.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.301
- What will the parents think?
- Exactly.

18:21.303 --> 18:23.370
Can we clear it
before the Board?

18:23.372 --> 18:25.839
I'm sorry, what's the actual
issue here?

18:25.841 --> 18:28.875
Hello? Have you read the thing?

18:28.877 --> 18:30.877
It's got language,
it's got violence...

18:30.879 --> 18:33.147
Obviously we'd tone
all of that down.

18:33.149 --> 18:34.348
That goes without saying.

18:34.350 --> 18:39.320
Not to mention the cost,
with all these crazy special effects,

18:39.322 --> 18:41.255
and, you know, costumes.

18:41.257 --> 18:44.858
Plus that girl who turns herself
into a bug-monster...

18:44.860 --> 18:46.894
What is that?
This is not Broadway.

18:46.896 --> 18:48.496
I'm painfully aware of that.

18:48.498 --> 18:50.998
We are dealing
with a limited budget.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.767
But this is about
more than money.

18:52.769 --> 18:54.735
This is about the kids.

18:54.737 --> 18:58.841
To perform the work of a playwright
who used to be one of them.

18:58.843 --> 19:00.843
You want to sell the Board?
You want to sell the parents?

19:00.845 --> 19:03.378
Then sell them
on Jason Sherwood,

19:03.380 --> 19:06.013
a former Kingston High School
student who came back

19:06.015 --> 19:08.282
to inspire the next generation.

19:08.284 --> 19:09.984
It's a great story,

19:09.986 --> 19:12.522
and I think I know a little something
about great stories.

19:13.424 --> 19:15.124
We'll double
normal ticket sales.

19:15.126 --> 19:17.927
You'll see the people of Kingston
are hungry for something new.

19:17.929 --> 19:19.796
And if it does come down to money,
I'll tell you this.

19:19.798 --> 19:22.799
If we go one penny over budget,
I'll pay for it myself.

19:22.801 --> 19:24.033
Out of my own pocket.

19:24.035 --> 19:26.769
That's how much
I believe in this play.

19:26.771 --> 19:28.370
Phil, what do you think?

19:28.372 --> 19:29.805
All right. Okay. Hold on now.

19:29.807 --> 19:31.206
We haven't talked
about the ending.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.307
What about the ending?

19:32.309 --> 19:35.378
Oh, it's dark.

19:35.380 --> 19:38.481
"Dark"? Trudie,
it's a teenage girl

19:38.483 --> 19:41.918
who hangs herself and then her dad
blows his freakin' brains out!

19:41.920 --> 19:43.521
You can't do that
on a high school stage!

19:43.522 --> 19:46.089
But everything
hinges on the ending!

19:46.091 --> 19:48.025
It's poetry. It's Ibsen!

19:48.027 --> 19:50.394
It's a lawsuit
waiting to happen!

19:50.396 --> 19:52.629
The ending would
have to change.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.834
All right.

19:57.836 --> 19:59.102
- We'll cut the ending.
- What?

19:59.104 --> 20:00.437
- What?
- We'll cut it.

20:00.439 --> 20:01.605
Leave it ambiguous.

20:01.607 --> 20:04.875
Yes. Yes, it could
heighten the mystery.

20:04.877 --> 20:06.477
Leave it open
to interpretation.

20:06.479 --> 20:07.611
I like it.

20:08.813 --> 20:10.147
Would Jason agree to that?

20:10.149 --> 20:11.949
I'm sure he understands,
as we all do,

20:11.951 --> 20:14.051
that one must be flexible
in the name of Theater.

20:16.641 --> 20:19.891
God, I'll have to start the auditions
by Friday, assemble my crew...

20:19.893 --> 20:21.960
- Carl. Carl!
- So much to do, so little time.

20:21.962 --> 20:24.362
But when the inspiration is there,
it hardly seems like work.

20:24.364 --> 20:26.532
Carl! We can't cut the ending,
we just can't.

20:26.534 --> 20:28.367
It's gonna ruin
the play, it'll kill it!

20:28.369 --> 20:30.836
- Relax.
- No! I won't relax.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.605
I mean... How am I supposed to
explain this to Jason?

20:32.607 --> 20:34.440
Very simply. Don't.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.044
- Because we're not going to cut it.
- We're not?

20:37.046 --> 20:40.279
No, I just said that to get the go-ahead
from der Fuhrer and his wife.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.114
That's how it works
in show business.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.917
It does? Keep it moving
at all costs.

20:44.919 --> 20:48.254
Believe me, when the entire audience
is bawling on opening night,

20:48.256 --> 20:51.391
even that sub-cretin Phil
will give it his blessing.

20:51.393 --> 20:53.126
- Really?
- Really.

20:54.228 --> 20:55.996
I give you my word.

20:55.998 --> 20:57.631
It's a game, Linda.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.733
And I know how to play it.

21:24.260 --> 21:28.464
- Oh, my goodness. You must be freezing!
- Oh, I'm fine.

21:28.466 --> 21:30.532
Let's get you some coffee
to warm up. Okay?

21:30.534 --> 21:33.201
No. I don't want coffee.
I have an ulcer.

21:33.203 --> 21:35.436
- Some herbal tea, then.
- No, no, no. That's fine.

21:35.438 --> 21:37.605
I don't... I don't
really want anything.

21:37.607 --> 21:39.675
How long have you had an ulcer?

21:39.677 --> 21:43.045
Since...
Since New York, actually.

21:43.047 --> 21:45.047
Since this play.

21:45.049 --> 21:47.215
Speaking of which...

21:47.217 --> 21:49.183
Yes! The play!
The play's the thing.

21:49.185 --> 21:51.053
All right. Here's the contract.

21:51.055 --> 21:53.322
Well, it's not really a contract,
it's more like an informal agreement.

21:53.324 --> 21:57.192
All it says is that you grant
the high school the right

21:57.194 --> 21:59.194
to mount a production
of your play.

21:59.196 --> 22:02.531
I just need your signature right here,
and then we're good to go.

22:09.206 --> 22:11.373
Everything okay?

22:16.480 --> 22:18.081
I don't want to be difficult...

22:18.083 --> 22:20.317
And I know
you're only trying to help,

22:20.319 --> 22:24.588
but this is not exactly a high
school play that I've written...

22:24.590 --> 22:26.257
Well, I understand that.

22:26.259 --> 22:28.226
And as much
as I want it produced,

22:28.228 --> 22:31.163
believe me, I do, I would just rather it
be not made at all,

22:31.165 --> 22:32.397
than be made badly.

22:32.399 --> 22:34.665
Well, Carl and I feel
exactly the same way.

22:34.667 --> 22:37.001
I...

22:37.003 --> 22:39.370
I just don't think I can do it.

22:45.311 --> 22:47.546
Do you want your father to win?

22:47.548 --> 22:48.647
What?

22:48.649 --> 22:51.316
I'm not stupid.
I read the play.

22:51.318 --> 22:53.252
I know where this came from.

22:53.254 --> 22:55.188
Your father doesn't
understand you, fine.

22:55.190 --> 22:56.988
He doesn't support you, fine...

22:56.990 --> 22:59.391
- He'd say he does...
- Well, financially, yes.

22:59.393 --> 23:01.526
Paying for law school.
He'll encourage you,

23:01.528 --> 23:04.262
but only if you do
what he wants you to do.

23:04.264 --> 23:07.533
Don't give in to him, Jason!
Prove him wrong.

23:09.236 --> 23:10.570
Well, what if he's not wrong?

23:10.572 --> 23:12.405
You know, you've just lost
confidence, that's all.

23:12.407 --> 23:16.275
That can happen to any artist.
But if you do this...

23:17.645 --> 23:19.325
you're gonna get it back.
I promise you.

23:36.433 --> 23:39.167
I feel like I'm signing
my soul away.

23:39.169 --> 23:41.069
Ja, Herr Faust!

23:41.071 --> 23:43.237
It's all mine.

23:46.141 --> 23:49.309
Sheila Nussbaum will be playing
the role of Margaret,

23:49.311 --> 23:51.545
the cruel Irish stepmother.

23:51.547 --> 23:54.381
Sheila's been working on her Irish,
haven't you, Sheila?

23:54.383 --> 23:56.818
I'll meet ya at the pub
on Grafton Street,

23:56.820 --> 23:58.186
ya bloody eejit!

24:00.257 --> 24:03.258
Will Traynor will play
Dr. Tim Sherman,

24:03.260 --> 24:04.759
the cold, alcoholic father.

24:04.761 --> 24:10.532
Fallon Hughes will play our heroine's
deceased mother, Ariadne,

24:10.534 --> 24:13.668
who haunts our tale
as the spectral Moth Queen.

24:13.670 --> 24:16.471
And last,
but certainly not least,

24:16.473 --> 24:20.476
Halle Anderson will be
Miss Jane Sherman,

24:20.478 --> 24:22.745
our sensitive,
misunderstood ingenue.

24:22.747 --> 24:24.246
Hi.

24:24.248 --> 24:26.216
And now, Mr. Sherwood,
may I say on behalf

24:26.218 --> 24:28.618
of the entire Kingston
High Theater Department

24:28.620 --> 24:30.486
it is an honor
to have you with us.

24:30.488 --> 24:34.224
And I know we have questions,
questions, questions.

24:34.226 --> 24:35.926
So, who wants to begin?

24:37.228 --> 24:38.495
Halle.

24:38.497 --> 24:43.400
Your play really captures what it feels
like to be a teenage girl,

24:43.402 --> 24:46.504
not knowing who you are,
and wondering if anyone gets you.

24:46.506 --> 24:49.507
And I want to be as real
as I can in my performance,

24:49.509 --> 24:51.710
so it would really help me to know
where Jane came from.

24:52.577 --> 24:55.145
What inspired you?

24:55.147 --> 24:56.647
You know, well...

24:56.649 --> 24:58.850
Everything I've written,

24:58.852 --> 25:02.386
everything my characters
experience, is authentic.

25:03.489 --> 25:06.257
Yep! It all happened
to me in my life.

25:06.259 --> 25:08.893
It's all something I've lived
through at some point.

25:08.895 --> 25:11.296
It's a very,
very personal story.

25:11.298 --> 25:13.599
- Anyone else have questions?
- Yeah.

25:13.601 --> 25:15.900
On page 52,

25:15.902 --> 25:18.970
when Tim is having
that big fight with Jane?

25:22.208 --> 25:25.444
Do you really think it's necessary
for him to hit her?

25:25.446 --> 25:28.481
I mean, isn't the whole point
that he's too repressed

25:28.483 --> 25:30.416
to show any emotion?

25:30.418 --> 25:32.752
It just seems kind of...

25:36.157 --> 25:37.558
Kind of what?

25:37.560 --> 25:39.292
Well, I don't know.

25:40.294 --> 25:42.562
- Trite.
- Oh, really, Will...

25:42.564 --> 25:43.696
Is that necessary?

25:48.770 --> 25:51.405
Yeah... I'm sorry.

25:52.841 --> 25:55.241
- Oh, dear lord.
- Will?

25:55.243 --> 25:56.442
Will, what is wrong with you?

25:56.444 --> 26:00.281
Do you know how lucky you are,
to workshop with the actual playwright?

26:00.283 --> 26:01.814
Jason is our honored guest.

26:01.816 --> 26:04.317
And if you can't treat him
with the respect he deserves,

26:04.319 --> 26:07.253
then maybe we can find someone else
to star in his play.

26:07.255 --> 26:08.821
Is that what you'd like?

26:08.823 --> 26:11.492
- No.
- No. I didn't think so.

26:11.494 --> 26:13.327
Did you take
your Ritalin today?

26:18.867 --> 26:20.935
Forget it. I think this was
a very big mistake.

26:20.937 --> 26:23.305
- I shouldn't have even...
- I'm so sorry...

26:23.307 --> 26:25.940
I am not going let some high school
smartass tell me that my work is trite!

26:25.942 --> 26:28.609
Of course not. You know what,
he's testing boundaries.

26:28.611 --> 26:29.910
I deal with
this stuff every day.

26:29.912 --> 26:31.379
You have to, it's your job.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.647
- I don't have to be doing this!
- No, you don't.

26:32.649 --> 26:33.748
You don't have
to do any of this.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.751
We so appreciate
you being here,

26:35.753 --> 26:37.954
and the kids are so excited,
and they love your play.

26:37.956 --> 26:39.655
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do. They love it.

26:39.657 --> 26:41.824
And they'd be crushed
if you pulled out now.

26:41.826 --> 26:45.328
- Not what's-his-name, Mr. Trite.
- Will? What...

26:45.330 --> 26:47.430
- He's intimidated by you.
- Oh, come on.

26:47.432 --> 26:50.800
He's just an insecure kid
in Kingston, Pennsylvania.

26:50.802 --> 26:52.501
And you're
a New York playwright.

26:52.503 --> 26:53.769
Are you really going
to let him get to you?

26:53.771 --> 26:55.638
I think you're
stronger than that.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.140
And, Jason,
your work is brilliant.

27:02.513 --> 27:04.247
Thank you. I'm sorry if
I'm overreacting a little bit,

27:04.249 --> 27:07.284
- No, no... Do not.
- I don't really know how to react to criticism.

27:07.286 --> 27:09.920
It's easy to feel discouraged,
but you shouldn't be.

27:09.922 --> 27:11.787
Not with something like that.

27:13.525 --> 27:15.492
- We're back.
- Good.

27:15.494 --> 27:18.128
Let's all rejoin
the circle, shall we?

27:19.731 --> 27:21.798
- I apologize for that.
- No, no, no...

27:25.371 --> 27:26.971
It's Will, right?

27:26.973 --> 27:31.476
Yeah. Look, man, I'm sorry
about what I said.

27:31.478 --> 27:34.412
No, don't be sorry. I am...

27:34.414 --> 27:36.047
I'm glad you brought it up.

27:37.484 --> 27:40.352
You're right. Tim is repressed.

27:40.354 --> 27:43.355
He's spent his whole life bottling
up everything he feels.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.890
That's why he hates
Jane so much.

27:44.892 --> 27:47.926
Because she represents
everything he isn't.

27:47.928 --> 27:49.929
She is wide open,

27:49.931 --> 27:53.833
she actually feels things,
she can't hold back.

27:53.835 --> 27:55.502
So when he hits her,
it's like all the rage

27:55.504 --> 27:57.636
he's been suppressing over
the years finally boils over,

27:57.638 --> 27:58.871
and when it happens,

27:58.873 --> 28:00.973
if it plays the way it should,

28:00.975 --> 28:02.976
it will not be trite.

28:05.578 --> 28:06.845
Does that answer your question?

28:08.348 --> 28:09.982
Yeah.

28:09.984 --> 28:11.350
Thanks.

28:11.352 --> 28:12.484
Yeah.

28:13.453 --> 28:14.621
Any other comments?

28:16.057 --> 28:18.058
Wonderful. Let's move on.

28:18.060 --> 28:22.561
As many of you know, I too was once
a budding young actor.

28:22.563 --> 28:24.630
Shocking, I know.

28:24.632 --> 28:26.765
The year was 1983.

28:26.767 --> 28:29.869
I was living in a fifth floor
walk-up on Avenue C,

28:29.871 --> 28:31.805
waiting for my big break.

28:31.807 --> 28:34.774
And then one day
I was called in to audition

28:34.776 --> 28:38.813
for that living God
of Theater himself,

28:38.815 --> 28:39.981
Mr. Stephen Sondheim.

28:41.351 --> 28:44.785
And though
I wasn't ultimately cast,

28:44.787 --> 28:47.888
I did receive a blessing
from the great man himself,

28:47.890 --> 28:52.160
who took me aside and said three
little words that changed my life.

28:53.129 --> 28:54.262
"Keep at it."

28:56.065 --> 28:58.800
Well, I did keep at it,

28:58.802 --> 29:02.938
and that's how I found my way here,
to Kingston, and to all of you.

29:02.940 --> 29:05.641
And now, as we embark
on that...

29:05.643 --> 29:08.410
tough but oh-so-rewarding
road ahead,

29:08.412 --> 29:11.646
I would like to honor Mr. Sondheim with
a humble blessing of my own...

29:11.648 --> 29:15.016
And if our young documentarian
would care to commence filming...

29:18.423 --> 29:20.123
Okay, hit it, George.

29:27.798 --> 29:30.967
♪ Bit by bit,
putting it together

29:30.969 --> 29:34.137
♪ Piece by piece, the only way to make
a work of art

29:34.139 --> 29:35.938
♪ Every moment

29:35.940 --> 29:38.175
♪ Every little detail
plays a part

29:38.177 --> 29:39.676
♪ Piece by piece...

29:39.678 --> 29:42.647
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

29:47.753 --> 29:49.420
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl!

29:49.422 --> 29:51.489
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

29:51.491 --> 29:53.024
Let me hear it one more time.

29:53.026 --> 29:54.692
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl!

29:54.694 --> 29:56.895
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

29:58.765 --> 30:00.632
All the trees.

30:00.634 --> 30:04.836
Watch, watch.
If a tree falls in a hallway...

30:06.140 --> 30:07.573
the entire world.

30:09.043 --> 30:12.178
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl!

30:12.180 --> 30:14.245
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

30:15.748 --> 30:18.449
Carl, could I have a word?

30:21.254 --> 30:26.758
It seems to me... And Carl...
Jason, correct me if I'm wrong

30:26.760 --> 30:29.594
that Margaret might
be a tad more menacing

30:29.596 --> 30:31.864
if she were just
a tiniest bit more subdued.

30:31.866 --> 30:33.632
Yes. Thank you.

30:35.468 --> 30:38.671
You mean like Amanda
in The Glass Menagerie?

30:38.673 --> 30:41.740
Dominating her children,
but with a deceptive softness.

30:41.742 --> 30:43.510
The velvet glove
and the iron grip.

30:43.512 --> 30:44.644
Exactly.

30:46.147 --> 30:47.881
Interesting.

30:50.051 --> 30:51.518
Let's try it.

30:51.520 --> 30:54.020
Sheila, I have an idea.

30:58.026 --> 30:59.827
That's a good note.

31:01.029 --> 31:03.530
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl.

31:03.532 --> 31:05.632
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

31:05.634 --> 31:06.766
Jason!

31:08.203 --> 31:09.737
Oh, shit.

31:09.739 --> 31:11.872
I don't believe this.

31:11.874 --> 31:13.908
I need to talk to you outside.
Let's go.

31:13.910 --> 31:16.644
Excuse me, but you can't just
barge in here like this.

31:16.646 --> 31:20.282
Excuse me, I'm gonna
talk to my son. Now!

31:20.284 --> 31:22.684
- Let's go!
- No. I don't think you understand...

31:22.686 --> 31:24.052
Ms. Sinclair, it's fine.

31:24.054 --> 31:26.021
Just go on without me, please.

31:27.656 --> 31:29.790
Go on without me, guys.

31:29.792 --> 31:30.958
I'll be right back.

31:35.198 --> 31:36.932
Is he gonna be okay?

31:36.934 --> 31:38.767
Perhaps not.

31:38.769 --> 31:41.236
But all great art
comes from pain.

31:42.772 --> 31:44.707
Remember that.

31:59.090 --> 32:00.791
Making such a crazy scene
right now!

32:00.793 --> 32:02.693
What is going on here?

32:02.695 --> 32:06.096
This is my school. And when I
see someone being manhandled,

32:06.098 --> 32:07.731
- it is my business.
- Now wait a second...

32:07.733 --> 32:13.270
Your son challenging himself in ways
that any parent would be proud of.

32:13.272 --> 32:15.339
And you finally show up,
and what do you do...

32:15.341 --> 32:17.074
Do you show any appreciation?

32:17.076 --> 32:18.842
No! You drag him
from rehearsal.

32:18.844 --> 32:21.745
Ms. Sinclair.
With all due respect,

32:21.747 --> 32:23.947
you have no idea
what's going on here.

32:23.949 --> 32:26.917
On the contrary.
I know exactly what's going on.

32:26.919 --> 32:29.253
What... What are you talking about?
What is she talking about?

32:29.255 --> 32:30.954
I've dealt with men like him before,
the alpha male.

32:30.956 --> 32:33.357
You may fool most people,
but you don't fool me.

32:33.359 --> 32:38.128
No, you do need to hear this!
All right then, go. Go!

32:38.130 --> 32:40.097
Go! But know this,
you cannot stop this play!

32:40.099 --> 32:43.000
Jason will have the life
he deserves, as an artist!

32:43.002 --> 32:45.002
Fine!

32:45.004 --> 32:47.206
- Oh. Oh, Jason...
- It's my ulcer.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.274
- It's totally fine.
- Here.

32:48.276 --> 32:50.109
All right. Okay.

32:50.111 --> 32:51.911
Let's get back inside,
all right?

32:51.913 --> 32:53.079
Let's get you inside.

32:53.081 --> 32:54.480
- Oh, no.
- Thank you.

32:56.283 --> 32:59.018
Come on in. I think
I have something for you.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.320
Oh, where is it, where is it?

33:02.622 --> 33:04.790
- I forgot my pills at home.
- Okay.

33:06.059 --> 33:08.160
I found it.

33:08.162 --> 33:09.495
Okay.

33:10.397 --> 33:12.899
This is still okay.

33:12.901 --> 33:14.134
Okay.

33:18.706 --> 33:20.307
It'll be gone
in like 10 minutes.

33:20.309 --> 33:22.174
Okay. Here you go.

33:32.153 --> 33:33.920
Thank you.

33:33.922 --> 33:36.224
I'm just glad
I had that bottle.

33:36.226 --> 33:38.393
No, I mean thank you for what
you did outside.

33:38.395 --> 33:40.795
For standing up
to him like that.

33:40.797 --> 33:41.963
Well, you know what?

33:41.965 --> 33:45.198
And someone needs to tell
him that he's wrong.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.200
Yeah.

33:47.202 --> 33:50.005
Well, he's been doing
that ever since my mother...

34:01.352 --> 34:02.852
Jason...

34:06.891 --> 34:08.389
I'm so sorry.

34:09.726 --> 34:11.393
I am so, so sorry.

34:12.295 --> 34:13.897
It's okay.

34:15.199 --> 34:17.367
He's an asshole.

34:17.369 --> 34:19.469
I know. I know.

34:19.471 --> 34:20.969
I know.

35:00.879 --> 35:02.413
Sorry.

35:13.259 --> 35:14.493
Okay.

35:16.129 --> 35:19.097
I'm going to head home now.

35:19.099 --> 35:20.298
Okay.

35:22.268 --> 35:24.469
And we'll talk a little later.

35:42.356 --> 35:45.057
What had she done?

35:45.059 --> 35:47.059
What had she done?

35:48.929 --> 35:51.430
Of course these things
do happen.

35:52.333 --> 35:56.037
The pages of literature
were filled with such affairs.

35:58.107 --> 36:01.376
It was only natural that
feelings would arise and...

36:02.811 --> 36:04.411
spill over.

36:12.321 --> 36:16.992
Surely no one would judge her
for such a minor indiscretion.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.108
Linda, dear.

36:33.110 --> 36:36.378
I have a somewhat
delicate matter

36:36.380 --> 36:38.113
to discuss with you.

36:38.115 --> 36:39.848
What? What is it?

36:39.850 --> 36:42.385
Jason and I were talking and...

36:43.521 --> 36:47.523
we agree that the backdrop
in the Moth Queen's lair,

36:47.525 --> 36:50.392
the scarlet organza has more
oomph than the voile,

36:50.394 --> 36:53.561
but it puts us
a tiny bit over budget.

36:53.563 --> 36:56.198
I hate to ask
but you did say...

36:56.200 --> 36:57.367
How much?

37:00.538 --> 37:02.372
We shall hang
a plaque in your honor.

37:02.374 --> 37:04.407
Don't worry about it,
Carl, it's fine.

37:06.945 --> 37:09.280
I feel like if I had a cane,
I'd look more regal.

37:09.282 --> 37:11.015
- Hey, Ms. Sinclair.
- Hello, Will.

37:11.017 --> 37:13.651
Hey, did you speak to Kapinas
about the backdrop?

37:13.653 --> 37:17.153
Yes! Yes, I spoke with Carl.

37:17.155 --> 37:19.690
May I have a private
word with you?

37:20.659 --> 37:23.094
Yes. Sure.

37:23.096 --> 37:25.229
- Shall we?
- Please excuse us, Will.

37:25.231 --> 37:26.530
Okay.

37:26.532 --> 37:29.100
- We can talk in here.
- Sure.

37:37.910 --> 37:42.680
And while it is possible
for people of different ages

37:42.682 --> 37:44.483
to have a meaningful
relationship...

37:44.485 --> 37:46.918
- Sure.
- I think...

37:46.920 --> 37:49.921
It is best that what happened,

37:49.923 --> 37:52.057
does not happen again.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.329
- Not that we did anything wrong.
- No. Not at all.

37:56.331 --> 37:58.431
Because of the play... The...

37:58.433 --> 38:01.334
We must be professional.

38:01.336 --> 38:03.202
The play requires
complete commitment

38:03.204 --> 38:05.438
with no distractions
and no complications.

38:05.440 --> 38:09.276
And as a playwright,
you need to keep a clear head

38:09.278 --> 38:10.678
from now on in.

38:11.946 --> 38:14.114
Right. Because the play's
the thing.

38:14.116 --> 38:15.382
Yes! The play is the thing.

38:15.384 --> 38:16.684
- The play's the thing.
- Yes!

38:16.686 --> 38:18.118
I'm glad you're in agreement.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.487
So we're still friends?

38:20.489 --> 38:22.724
Oh, Jason, of course.
No. Of course we're friends.

38:22.726 --> 38:24.291
- I was just worried for a second.
- No, no, no.

38:24.293 --> 38:27.061
You have more important things
to worry about,

38:27.063 --> 38:30.397
like whether or not Will nails that
funeral speech in Act two.

38:30.399 --> 38:33.168
- Right. Because he always loses focus in the middle.
- He does.

38:33.170 --> 38:36.638
Yes, he does, so you should get
out there and...

38:36.640 --> 38:38.573
- And work on that, so...
- Yeah.

38:38.575 --> 38:41.242
Well, I might need your help.

38:41.244 --> 38:43.244
Well, all right then...

38:43.246 --> 38:44.379
You will have it.

38:45.515 --> 38:47.549
- Thank you.
- Let's do it!

38:49.618 --> 38:52.287
- Well, no. Let's... we'll go out, and...
- Yeah.

39:02.999 --> 39:04.734
Excuse me.

39:07.537 --> 39:09.038
Hi.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.340
Just so you know...

39:11.342 --> 39:13.743
Just for the record
I did not go to the school

39:13.745 --> 39:15.111
because of the play.

39:15.113 --> 39:16.746
I was there because
Jason lied to me.

39:16.748 --> 39:18.447
- Dr. Sherwood, I'm not interested.
- No, no, no.

39:18.449 --> 39:20.349
Just so you know...
On Tuesdays and Thursdays,

39:20.351 --> 39:23.286
he's supposed to be taking LSAT
prep test up in Scranton.

39:23.288 --> 39:25.722
He told me that these rehearsals
would in no way interfere with that,

39:25.724 --> 39:28.658
and now I find out not only he's
been skipping the classes altogether,

39:28.660 --> 39:30.160
- but he lied to me.
- Oh, come on!

39:30.162 --> 39:32.800
- Oh, no. You expect me to believe this?
- Yeah. I do, look, look...

39:32.835 --> 39:34.765
He sent this to me an hour before
I saw you yesterday.

39:34.767 --> 39:37.667
"Hi, Dad. On my way
to LSAT prep class."

39:37.669 --> 39:39.202
"Be back later tonight."

39:40.805 --> 39:42.773
You see that, right?

39:42.775 --> 39:45.175
Well, if he lied,

39:45.177 --> 39:48.079
it's because he feels
he has no choice.

39:48.081 --> 39:51.449
How can he trust you?
You are crushing his spirit.

39:51.451 --> 39:54.585
Forcing Jason to go
to law school is like...

39:54.587 --> 39:56.787
Like using a Shakespeare
folio for toilet paper.

39:56.789 --> 40:00.057
"Forcing him!" I've never forced
Jason to do anything.

40:00.059 --> 40:02.260
Going to law school
was entirely his idea.

40:02.262 --> 40:03.594
I'm sure you're
begging him not to go.

40:03.596 --> 40:05.164
- This is unbelievable.
- Yes, it is.

40:05.166 --> 40:06.465
You got me all figured out,
right.

40:06.467 --> 40:08.167
There's nothing I can say
that won't convince you

40:08.169 --> 40:09.468
I'm not a complete asshole?

40:09.470 --> 40:12.806
You could start by giving Jason
the respect

40:12.808 --> 40:15.074
and the freedom
that he deserves.

40:15.076 --> 40:16.810
Maybe I should stop
talking to him altogether?

40:16.812 --> 40:19.078
- Would that work for you?
- That might be an improvement, yeah.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.546
Okay, you obviously
don't have any kids!

40:20.548 --> 40:23.282
Excuse me! Excuse me!

40:23.284 --> 40:24.617
I have had hundreds of kids,

40:24.619 --> 40:26.286
and I have had
a lot of experience...

40:26.288 --> 40:30.089
Hey, I'm doing the best that
I can with Jason.

40:30.091 --> 40:32.926
Perhaps your best
isn't good enough.

40:33.828 --> 40:35.228
Is that what you tell
your students?

40:35.230 --> 40:38.399
There is no comparison!
Do you know what?

40:38.401 --> 40:39.466
You...

40:39.468 --> 40:40.568
You are an asshole!

40:41.838 --> 40:43.236
Asshole.

40:43.238 --> 40:45.171
- I'm a rascal?
- I said...

40:56.251 --> 40:57.751
<i>Hello.</i>

40:57.753 --> 41:00.287
It's Linda.
Do you have a minute?

41:00.289 --> 41:01.790
<i>Hey, Linda.</i>

41:01.792 --> 41:03.525
I just ran into
your father and...

41:03.527 --> 41:04.859
<i>Is that Ms. Sinclair?</i>

41:04.861 --> 41:06.794
<i>Hi, Ms. Sinclair!</i>

41:06.796 --> 41:09.263
- Who's that?
- Wait, look...

41:09.265 --> 41:12.132
Halle's over.
We're running lines.

41:12.134 --> 41:13.802
Over? Are...

41:13.804 --> 41:15.370
Are you still at school?

41:15.372 --> 41:17.572
<i>No, my place.</i>

41:17.574 --> 41:20.275
<i>It just seemed easier.</i>

41:20.277 --> 41:21.676
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

41:21.678 --> 41:24.179
Everything's fine.

41:24.181 --> 41:25.780
I'm sorry to interrupt.

41:25.782 --> 41:27.550
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

41:27.552 --> 41:28.917
<i>Okay.</i>

41:28.919 --> 41:30.819
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

41:30.821 --> 41:33.488
- Bye, Ms. Sinclair!
- Bye.

41:33.490 --> 41:36.424
<i>Shall we pick it up
where we left off?</i>

41:40.898 --> 41:42.465
So with tax and shipping,

41:42.467 --> 41:45.568
it comes to $433.52 cents.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.470
That includes the smoke machine

41:47.472 --> 41:49.505
and the slightly more
expensive strobe light.

41:49.507 --> 41:53.743
Oh, Carl, is all this
really necessary?

41:53.745 --> 41:56.245
Well, it is if you want the magic
of the play to work.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.514
But if you're content to see
The Chrysalis undermined

41:58.516 --> 42:02.318
I'll run out and buy two
flashlights and a Lazy Susan.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.187
Oh, calm down,
I was only asking.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.355
Sorry.

42:09.628 --> 42:12.864
Halle's doing spectacularly well,
don't you think?

42:12.866 --> 42:14.532
Bless you.

42:17.503 --> 42:19.370
Stop.

42:23.509 --> 42:26.644
I can't believe Mr. Adams
gave us that quiz!

42:26.646 --> 42:28.480
Halle...

42:28.482 --> 42:30.649
May I speak with
you a moment, please?

42:34.587 --> 42:36.021
Take a seat.

42:41.761 --> 42:43.696
Well, first of all,

42:43.698 --> 42:47.666
I want to tell you what a fantastic job
you're doing as Jane.

42:47.668 --> 42:50.669
Thanks. I've been working
my butt off,

42:50.671 --> 42:52.438
but I love it.

42:52.440 --> 42:56.309
I know how important
this play is to you,

42:56.311 --> 42:59.612
and I wouldn't want
anything to jeopardize that.

42:59.614 --> 43:01.647
Wait. Am I in trouble?

43:01.649 --> 43:03.916
No, no, no, no.
Everything's fine.

43:03.918 --> 43:05.051
It's just...

43:06.587 --> 43:09.422
Well...

43:09.424 --> 43:11.558
It's about Jason.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.794
Some of us have noticed,

43:13.796 --> 43:15.929
that your behavior
with him lately

43:15.931 --> 43:17.798
has been a little
inappropriate.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.000
I haven't done anything.

43:19.002 --> 43:20.801
I know, but appearances
are important.

43:20.803 --> 43:22.603
And people tend
to make assumptions.

43:22.605 --> 43:23.671
Well, they shouldn't!

43:23.673 --> 43:25.939
I know, I know. But...

43:25.941 --> 43:27.107
They do.

43:29.144 --> 43:33.447
Now, I understand that
you want to pursue acting

43:33.449 --> 43:35.182
as a career. Is that true?

43:36.785 --> 43:39.687
May I offer you some advice?

43:39.689 --> 43:41.422
As you go out on auditions,

43:41.424 --> 43:43.692
you'll be meeting a lot of men,
powerful men,

43:43.694 --> 43:47.429
who may be interested in you for
reasons other than your talent.

43:47.431 --> 43:49.563
Now you're a very
attractive young woman,

43:49.565 --> 43:51.999
and you may be tempted
to take advantage of that.

43:52.001 --> 43:54.301
In the short term,
that may work.

43:54.303 --> 43:57.672
But in the long term, people might
lose respect for you.

43:57.674 --> 44:00.842
And they may find
you a little, um, trashy.

44:00.844 --> 44:03.979
I know I sound harsh, but it's only because
I care about you,

44:03.981 --> 44:06.849
and I want you to earn the respect
that you deserve as a woman,

44:06.851 --> 44:09.752
not because of your body,
but because of your mind.

44:09.754 --> 44:13.622
And that is why you need
to stay away from Jason.

44:13.624 --> 44:14.891
Am I making any sense?

44:18.729 --> 44:21.732
It just seems really unfair.

44:21.734 --> 44:24.034
Guys can get away with anything,
but girls can't.

44:24.036 --> 44:25.736
I know. It is unfair.

44:25.738 --> 44:28.472
But, unfortunately, that's the world
in which we live.

44:28.474 --> 44:29.606
I wish it weren't.

44:29.608 --> 44:32.410
Oh, so do I.

44:32.412 --> 44:35.112
But I have learned
from experience that wishing

44:36.014 --> 44:37.481
doesn't always make it so.

44:37.483 --> 44:40.818
Changing the world is hard work,
but we can do it.

44:40.820 --> 44:44.689
We women just have to
stick together, that's all.

44:48.361 --> 44:50.695
I'm so glad we had
this conversation.

44:50.697 --> 44:53.898
Go ahead to lunch, go on.
And I'll see you at rehearsal.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.567
Yeah.

44:55.569 --> 44:56.969
- See ya.
- Okay.

45:06.812 --> 45:11.050
And at $800, the fake fireplace
is a real bargain.

45:11.952 --> 45:14.086
Don't play with that, fellas.

45:14.088 --> 45:15.221
Sorry.

45:18.092 --> 45:20.726
Oh, Linda, what can I say.

45:20.728 --> 45:23.530
You are like the Peggy Guggenheim
of high school theater.

45:23.532 --> 45:24.730
But prettier.

45:33.842 --> 45:36.443
I don't believe this.

45:36.445 --> 45:39.880
- Linda, just relax...
- She is a student, Jason.

45:39.882 --> 45:41.815
What a scummy,
sleazy thing to do!

45:41.817 --> 45:43.782
- I know.
- And you!

45:43.784 --> 45:45.084
I expected better from you.

45:45.086 --> 45:46.953
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's too late.

45:46.955 --> 45:49.489
This is going on
your permanent record.

45:49.491 --> 45:53.460
No. You, you can forget about that
letter of recommendation.

45:53.462 --> 45:54.961
What! You can't do that!

45:54.963 --> 45:56.963
You've left me no choice.

45:56.965 --> 45:58.966
Linda.

45:58.968 --> 46:00.668
- Linda!
- Oh my God. My parents are going to kill me!

46:00.670 --> 46:01.903
No, no, no. It's fine.

46:01.905 --> 46:03.671
- Just sit down. Relax, okay.
- No, they are!

46:03.673 --> 46:04.939
I'm going to go take
care of it... Linda!

46:04.941 --> 46:07.107
What?

46:07.109 --> 46:09.776
Hey, Linda.

46:09.778 --> 46:11.112
Can we talk about this, please?

46:11.114 --> 46:13.080
No. I don't need to
talk about anything.

46:13.082 --> 46:14.482
I know what I saw.

46:14.484 --> 46:16.551
- But we didn't do anything!
- Oh, how dare you.

46:16.553 --> 46:17.752
I catch you fooling
around with a student,

46:17.754 --> 46:20.689
She started it.
I didn't start it.

46:20.691 --> 46:23.660
You know, you're a
role model to these kids.

46:23.662 --> 46:26.696
To take advantage
like that, that is...

46:26.698 --> 46:27.997
Unconscionable!

46:27.999 --> 46:33.669
I thought you were ready to be
a professional, but apparently not.

46:33.671 --> 46:36.206
Because this was
an amateur move, Jason.

46:36.208 --> 46:37.540
Amateur!

46:37.542 --> 46:38.641
This is bullshit.

46:38.643 --> 46:39.776
Excuse me?

46:39.778 --> 46:40.877
You're jealous!

46:43.248 --> 46:46.149
As if I'd be jealous of some
dirty little make out session

46:46.151 --> 46:47.584
in the boys' dressing room.

46:47.586 --> 46:49.486
No, you'd rather have a quick fuck
in the classroom.

46:49.488 --> 46:52.990
Is that what you want? You want me
to bend you over your desk right now?

46:52.992 --> 46:54.023
- You are awful!
- God knows you need it...

46:54.025 --> 46:55.391
You are awful!

46:58.629 --> 46:59.829
Shit.

46:59.831 --> 47:01.899
Hit me with a piece of fucking prop...

47:36.770 --> 47:42.941
Take me off your goddamn list,
and never call me again!

47:53.000 --> 48:00.000
Hmun dang zawng aia tlawma
Air Tickets la duh tan.

48:10.002 --> 48:17.002
In/Office lamah pawh a thlawnin
tickets kan dahsak thei.

48:24.852 --> 48:27.722
- Fallon Hughes.
- Here.

48:27.724 --> 48:29.857
Ed McKee.

48:32.095 --> 48:33.861
Benjamin Meyer.

48:35.699 --> 48:37.765
What is the matter
with you people?

48:37.767 --> 48:39.601
Settle down.

48:39.603 --> 48:41.404
Or you're looking at detention!
Is that clear?

49:21.679 --> 49:24.347
And 'cause the theme this year is
"Winter Dreamz,"

49:24.349 --> 49:28.152
I thought we could have giant beds
and snowmen in PJ's...

49:28.154 --> 49:31.022
No, no, that is
a horrible idea.

49:31.024 --> 49:32.991
- I need to talk.
- Linda!

49:32.993 --> 49:35.659
Okay, Joni, lets... Let's talk about
it tomorrow.

49:35.661 --> 49:37.194
But this is "Winter Dreamz."

49:37.196 --> 49:38.529
Out.

49:41.267 --> 49:42.934
Something terrible
has happened...

49:42.936 --> 49:47.938
you and Shakespeare doing
it in the classroom!

49:49.074 --> 49:53.245
Because Halle Anderson is spreading
vicious rumors about me,

49:53.247 --> 49:57.382
and I just caught her defacing my
classroom door with obscenities!

49:57.384 --> 49:59.784
Why would Halle do that?

49:59.786 --> 50:00.851
Why?

50:00.853 --> 50:02.820
Because yesterday, I caught her

50:02.822 --> 50:04.955
messing around with Jason Sherwood
in the boys' dressing room!

50:04.957 --> 50:06.091
That's why!

50:06.093 --> 50:09.161
Oh, God. Oh, God...

50:09.163 --> 50:10.429
You should have told us.

50:10.431 --> 50:11.830
I gave her a warning.

50:11.832 --> 50:13.365
I just... I thought that
would be enough.

50:13.367 --> 50:15.367
I didn't expect
all this to happen.

50:15.369 --> 50:16.735
Typical.

50:16.737 --> 50:18.738
You know, good teacher
lets a student off easy,

50:18.740 --> 50:20.273
she turns around
and stabs her in the back.

50:20.275 --> 50:23.141
And him, messing around
with one of our kids,

50:23.143 --> 50:24.843
I'll knock his block off!

50:24.845 --> 50:27.112
Where... Where is Halle now?
In rehearsal?

50:27.114 --> 50:30.182
Yes, but I don't think...

50:30.184 --> 50:33.153
Do we really have to do this now?
In front of everyone?

50:33.155 --> 50:34.922
I thought you'd just pull her
into your office.

50:34.924 --> 50:37.191
No. We've got to clean this mess up
before it gets any worse.

50:37.193 --> 50:39.993
These types of rumors can do real
damage to a teacher's reputation.

50:39.995 --> 50:42.931
Even one as sterling as yours.
But I'd really rather not...

50:42.933 --> 50:45.499
Damn it, Linda. These punks
took advantage of you!

50:45.501 --> 50:48.936
And tell them you're not going
to roll over for their B.S.

50:50.138 --> 50:52.039
You!

50:52.041 --> 50:53.740
And you! Get over here,
right now.

50:53.742 --> 50:57.078
What's the meaning of this, Phil?
We're trying to rehearse.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.480
Yep. Well, rehearsal's
gonna wait.

50:59.482 --> 51:01.282
It seems Romeo and Juliet here

51:01.284 --> 51:03.518
have been fooling around a little bit
after play practice.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.819
What on earth
are you talking about?

51:04.821 --> 51:06.120
And to top it all off,

51:06.122 --> 51:08.289
sweet little Juliet
has been spreading

51:08.291 --> 51:10.425
some pretty nasty lies about
one of our best teachers.

51:10.427 --> 51:12.026
They're not lies!

51:12.028 --> 51:13.828
She's just jealous,
because he's with me now!

51:13.830 --> 51:14.996
- So you admit it?
- Oh, Christ.

51:14.998 --> 51:17.432
- Oh, Halle, really?
- It's true!

51:17.434 --> 51:19.400
She did him in her room.
Everyone knows!

51:19.402 --> 51:23.105
You are digging a very
big hole for yourself, right now.

51:23.107 --> 51:25.007
Where are you going, Halle?
You get back here, miss!

51:25.009 --> 51:26.141
Halle...

51:26.143 --> 51:28.511
Hey, what's with
all the shouting?

51:28.513 --> 51:30.946
Traynor, what the hell is that?

51:30.948 --> 51:32.147
Oh, good Lord.

51:33.084 --> 51:35.185
It's for my big
suicide at the end.

51:36.288 --> 51:37.787
No, sir, it is not!

51:37.789 --> 51:39.189
Hey, we had an agreement!

51:39.191 --> 51:41.992
What? I'm sorry...
What agreement?

51:41.994 --> 51:47.398
Don't play dumb, Romeo. Now, you know
damn well we had to cut that ending!

51:47.400 --> 51:48.599
What?

51:49.535 --> 51:51.435
What? What?

51:51.437 --> 51:53.938
Why are you even
rehearsing this ending?

51:53.940 --> 51:55.538
You trying to pull
one over on me, Carl?

51:55.540 --> 51:57.073
You want to get yourself fired?

51:57.075 --> 51:59.576
You have it all wrong,
Phil, as usual.

51:59.578 --> 52:05.348
Yes. I wanted the actors to experience
the full darkness of Jason's play.

52:05.350 --> 52:07.517
But it was never my intention to
perform the ending.

52:07.519 --> 52:09.420
After all,
we did agree to cut it.

52:09.422 --> 52:13.357
Carl, what the hell? You never said
I had to cut the ending!

52:13.359 --> 52:14.859
You never said that.

52:14.861 --> 52:17.128
But it wasn't
my place to tell you.

52:17.130 --> 52:19.296
It was my understanding that
Linda cleared it with you

52:19.298 --> 52:21.832
- when you signed the contract.
- Carl. No.

52:21.834 --> 52:23.334
- You knew?
- Carl. No.

52:23.336 --> 52:24.969
- You knew?
- No. No...

52:24.971 --> 52:27.071
You did read the contract,
didn't you?

52:27.073 --> 52:29.840
She forced me to sign it, without
actually reading it.

52:29.842 --> 52:31.375
You never told me
I'd have to cut the ending,

52:31.377 --> 52:33.110
because you knew I would
never agree to it!

52:33.112 --> 52:35.113
- No, no, no...
- Linda, is this true?

52:35.115 --> 52:36.416
No...

52:36.418 --> 52:38.084
- No...
- Is it true?

52:38.086 --> 52:39.452
Is that true?

52:41.120 --> 52:43.522
Yes, but I can explain...

52:43.524 --> 52:47.093
As if I'd be jealous of some
dirty little make out session

52:47.095 --> 52:51.364
- with one of your old students.
- Stop it!

52:51.366 --> 52:55.134
- God knows you need it...
- You're awful! You're awful!

52:55.136 --> 52:56.536
Oh, my...

52:59.542 --> 53:00.941
Told you.

53:00.943 --> 53:02.876
She's a lying old whore.

53:02.878 --> 53:05.378
She's... Where...
Linda, you're fired.

53:05.380 --> 53:07.280
You better run. You hear me!

53:07.282 --> 53:09.148
You are fired, lady!

53:09.150 --> 53:11.218
Yeah, who's trashy now?

53:11.220 --> 53:13.420
Hey, Linda! Linda!

53:13.422 --> 53:16.156
- Leave me alone!
- Don't run away from me.

53:16.158 --> 53:18.025
How could you lie
to me like that?

53:18.027 --> 53:19.226
I trusted you.

53:19.228 --> 53:20.928
And you sat there
and you lied to my face!

53:20.930 --> 53:23.297
Get away, get away! Fuck! No!

53:23.299 --> 53:25.333
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! No!

53:27.004 --> 53:28.569
Not again!

53:29.537 --> 53:33.173
Fuck! I fucking
hate this school.

54:12.450 --> 54:16.152
Ma'am, you've been in an accident,
okay. You're in the hospital.

54:16.154 --> 54:18.487
No, you're going
to be just fine.

54:18.489 --> 54:19.622
No, I won't.

54:19.624 --> 54:22.291
Yes, you will. I promise.

54:22.293 --> 54:24.460
Hi, Dr. Sherwood.

54:24.462 --> 54:26.997
No, no, not him. Someone else.

54:26.999 --> 54:28.999
Get me someone else, please.

54:29.001 --> 54:31.435
Honey, there's no one else unless
you want to wait a few hours.

54:31.437 --> 54:33.270
I'll wait. I can wait.
Please...

54:34.238 --> 54:35.372
I...

54:35.374 --> 54:37.540
Can you excuse us, Nurse?

54:37.542 --> 54:38.975
Oh, sure.

54:38.977 --> 54:41.379
I think she's still in shock.

54:41.381 --> 54:44.782
Don't worry, honey,
you're in good hands.

54:50.657 --> 54:51.824
This is awkward.

54:54.127 --> 54:56.328
It says here you
were in a car accident

54:56.330 --> 54:59.665
after you rubbed pepper spray
into your eyes?

55:05.705 --> 55:07.673
Okay.

55:07.675 --> 55:09.541
Have you any dizziness?

55:09.543 --> 55:11.143
- No.
- No?

55:12.212 --> 55:13.779
- Any nausea?
- No.

55:16.016 --> 55:18.017
- Neck pain?
- Yes.

55:18.019 --> 55:19.285
Where?

55:20.454 --> 55:21.788
Up here?

55:23.423 --> 55:24.556
Does that hurt?

55:25.692 --> 55:28.027
Yeah...

55:28.029 --> 55:30.363
How severe, as if on a scale
of one to 10?

55:30.365 --> 55:33.600
I don't know. Three? Five?

55:33.602 --> 55:37.737
I don't know, it's something we have
to ask in the hospital.

55:38.706 --> 55:40.775
All right, let's take
a look at this.

55:45.047 --> 55:46.447
Okay.

55:47.582 --> 55:50.050
It's going to sting.

55:55.658 --> 55:58.527
Well, that's not so bad.

55:58.529 --> 56:00.829
I'll have a nurse
clean this up.

56:00.831 --> 56:02.497
You're actually
a very lucky woman.

56:02.499 --> 56:04.467
I don't think you're going to
need stitches.

56:17.647 --> 56:19.214
Okay.

56:20.616 --> 56:22.717
Here you are, here...

56:22.719 --> 56:24.753
It's good to get
it out like that.

56:24.755 --> 56:27.222
Could you please leave?

56:29.092 --> 56:31.227
Listen, you've been through
a very physical trauma.

56:31.229 --> 56:32.627
It's perfectly
normal to have...

56:32.629 --> 56:34.362
No, please. Please...

56:34.364 --> 56:37.199
Honestly, emotional outbursts
like this are very common.

56:37.201 --> 56:39.301
Stop it. Stop being
so nice to me.

56:39.303 --> 56:42.371
You hate me.
I know you hate me.

56:42.373 --> 56:45.241
I don't hate you.
Ms. Sinclair, listen...

56:45.243 --> 56:48.812
I know we've had our differences,
I know that.

56:49.714 --> 56:52.416
But you know, I...

56:52.418 --> 56:56.119
Honestly, I appreciate everything
that you have done for Jason.

56:56.121 --> 56:57.554
Oh, God.

56:57.556 --> 57:01.725
And I can tell you right now,
you mean the world to him.

57:06.398 --> 57:09.434
What? What am I saying?

57:12.805 --> 57:14.706
I...

57:21.480 --> 57:24.415
Had sex with your son.

57:25.751 --> 57:26.951
What?

57:28.153 --> 57:29.554
You heard me.

57:33.827 --> 57:35.694
How long...

57:37.230 --> 57:38.697
How long has this
been going on?

57:39.833 --> 57:42.834
- Is it a relationship?
- No! It was one time...

57:42.836 --> 57:45.271
When did this happen?

57:45.273 --> 57:46.805
Can we be done now?

57:46.807 --> 57:49.276
No. No, we can't be done.

57:49.278 --> 57:50.577
We're not done until...

57:50.579 --> 57:52.178
What... What's wrong with you?

57:53.248 --> 57:56.517
You go around sleeping
with your old students?

57:56.519 --> 57:57.852
I don't want to talk about it.

57:57.854 --> 57:59.186
You're the one
who brought it up.

57:59.188 --> 58:01.589
No, don't you have
something important to do?

58:01.591 --> 58:03.824
Don't you have a life
to save or something?

58:08.397 --> 58:10.398
I'm going to have someone
take you to orthopedics.

58:18.206 --> 58:19.807
Ma'am, your card was denied.

58:25.348 --> 58:26.881
Okay, try this one.

58:26.883 --> 58:28.581
Okay.

58:28.583 --> 58:30.483
Can someone call me a cab?

58:33.288 --> 58:38.626
Jason, okay, calm down.
Jason, I understand. No.

58:38.628 --> 58:40.227
Turn around. Take me back.
Take me back inside.

58:40.229 --> 58:41.762
- What? What?
- Take me back.

58:43.533 --> 58:45.600
Lady! I'm sorry. Are you okay?

58:45.602 --> 58:47.636
- Let me call you back. Okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

58:47.638 --> 58:50.405
- It's okay. I'm fine.
- Mike. Mike.

58:50.407 --> 58:51.907
I'll take her, it's fine.
I'll wait with her.

58:51.909 --> 58:53.275
No, no, no.
I'm going to wait inside.

58:53.277 --> 58:54.710
No, no. I need to talk to you.

58:54.712 --> 58:56.578
Take the chair inside, please.

59:00.485 --> 59:02.518
How's your neck?

59:02.520 --> 59:04.654
Just say what you need to say
and leave me alone.

59:05.990 --> 59:08.591
Is it true? Did you lie
to Jason about the play?

59:09.894 --> 59:11.562
Yes. Yes, I did.

59:12.797 --> 59:14.897
I don't believe it.

59:14.899 --> 59:17.400
What kind of teacher are you?

59:17.402 --> 59:20.603
I mean, you come at me with
this holier than thou bullshit,

59:20.605 --> 59:22.873
and this is what you do?
What's wrong with you?

59:22.875 --> 59:24.675
Fine, fine. I get it.
I'm horrible,

59:24.677 --> 59:27.311
I'm a horrible person.
Now would you leave?

59:27.313 --> 59:29.013
No. Not until you tell me what
you're going to do about this.

59:29.015 --> 59:32.416
You know, I've been fired.
Isn't that enough?

59:32.418 --> 59:34.385
What about the play?
Who cares about the play.

59:34.387 --> 59:37.055
I do! I care about the play.
I care about my son.

59:37.057 --> 59:39.590
Yeah! Now you care. Fine. Now that
everything's ruined.

59:39.592 --> 59:43.427
This is all your fault. I wouldn't
even be here if it wasn't for you.

59:43.429 --> 59:44.828
I don't know where
you possibly get that.

59:44.830 --> 59:46.430
He never would have
written the play

59:46.432 --> 59:49.300
if you hadn't been such an abusive,
alcoholic jerk.

59:49.302 --> 59:52.303
Who took out all your anger on
your son after your wife died.

59:52.305 --> 59:53.905
Oh, my God.

59:53.907 --> 59:55.875
Is that what this is about?

59:55.877 --> 59:58.044
- You believe all that?
- Don't try to deny it.

59:58.046 --> 01:00:00.881
No, no, no. I don't drink,
for your information.

01:00:00.883 --> 01:00:03.049
I haven't had a drink
since medical school.

01:00:03.051 --> 01:00:04.784
Jason's mom isn't dead.

01:00:04.786 --> 01:00:08.921
She lives up in Teaneck.
She's remarried.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.760
He... He said it was
based on his life.

01:00:13.762 --> 01:00:16.696
Well, jeez, if Jason said it then
it must be true, right?

01:00:16.698 --> 01:00:19.866
God knows there's never been a writer
that just made stuff up.

01:00:19.868 --> 01:00:23.670
You think he turns
into a monster as well?

01:00:23.672 --> 01:00:25.338
- Okay. I get it.
- Do you?

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.508
Because for an Advanced English teacher
you seem awfully naive to me.

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.644
Or is your head so full
of, of these stories

01:00:30.646 --> 01:00:33.480
you don't know the difference
between fact and fiction.

01:00:33.482 --> 01:00:35.115
Is that why you slept with him?

01:00:36.485 --> 01:00:37.651
Thought he was Lord Byron
or something?

01:00:37.653 --> 01:00:39.086
You know what?
You don't know me.

01:00:39.088 --> 01:00:40.687
You don't know
anything about me.

01:00:40.689 --> 01:00:43.857
Shoe's on the other foot.

01:00:43.859 --> 01:00:45.892
Marilyn Avenue.

01:00:45.894 --> 01:00:48.394
Hey, you can't
run away from this.

01:00:48.396 --> 01:00:49.596
Yes, I can.

01:00:54.403 --> 01:00:58.072
<i>Hi, it's Linda.
Leave a message.</i>

01:01:00.009 --> 01:01:02.177
<i>Linda, it's Carl.</i>

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.514
<i>I know I behaved abominably,</i>

01:01:05.516 --> 01:01:07.783
<i>you have every right to be mad,</i>

01:01:07.785 --> 01:01:10.419
<i>but please call me.</i>

01:01:10.421 --> 01:01:12.186
<i>It's about the play.</i>

01:01:13.556 --> 01:01:15.557
<i>Hi, it's Linda.
Leave a message.</i>

01:01:17.128 --> 01:01:19.094
<i>Linda, call me, I beg of you.</i>

01:01:19.096 --> 01:01:20.963
<i>I swear I'll never
deceive you again.</i>

01:01:20.965 --> 01:01:23.132
<i>I'll be entirely
honest from now on.</i>

01:01:23.134 --> 01:01:25.567
<i>I'll...</i>

01:01:25.569 --> 01:01:29.939
<i>I'll even tell you
my deepest, darkest secret.</i>

01:01:29.941 --> 01:01:31.541
<i>Something
I've never told anyone.</i>

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.943
My audition for Sondheim...

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.180
I lied.

01:01:38.183 --> 01:01:41.417
I... I did have
an audition, but...

01:01:41.419 --> 01:01:44.954
As soon as I walked in
and saw him sitting there,

01:01:44.956 --> 01:01:48.958
looking at me with those dark genius eyes,
I couldn't breathe.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.828
I thought I was going to die.

01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:53.697
The last thing I remember
before I blacked out

01:01:53.699 --> 01:01:57.901
was the look of utter confusion
on Sondheim's face.

01:01:57.903 --> 01:02:00.871
And the sound of
the stage manager saying,

01:02:00.873 --> 01:02:03.208
"I think his name is Ka-penis."

01:02:04.911 --> 01:02:07.112
It was the worst
experience of my life.

01:02:09.048 --> 01:02:11.917
<i>So there it is.</i>

01:02:12.852 --> 01:02:15.922
<i>I stand naked before you.</i>

01:02:15.924 --> 01:02:18.457
<i>Please come back. Help me out.</i>

01:02:18.459 --> 01:02:24.629
<i>Linda, I'm having
a nervous breakdown!</i>

01:02:24.631 --> 01:02:26.498
<i>I'm having chest pains.</i>

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.134
<i>And a nervous breakdown!</i>

01:02:29.203 --> 01:02:31.003
<i>Call me!</i>

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.617
There has been an emergency.

01:02:44.619 --> 01:02:46.976
- Carl is in the hospital.
- What, what happened?

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.920
And, well, he keeled over
during rehearsal.

01:02:48.922 --> 01:02:51.022
And the kids called 911.
They're beside themselves.

01:02:51.023 --> 01:02:52.800
Oh, my God! Is he okay?

01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:54.794
Well, it wasn't a heart attack,
thank goodness.

01:02:54.796 --> 01:02:56.629
They think stress. Stress.

01:02:56.631 --> 01:02:58.664
But there's no way
he can finish the play.

01:02:58.666 --> 01:03:01.267
And we are days away
from opening night,

01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:03.070
there's a ton of work to do.

01:03:03.072 --> 01:03:05.607
And we've sold
$18,000 in tickets.

01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:08.976
We need the money.
Someone needs to step in.

01:03:10.945 --> 01:03:13.113
Yeah, you should call Jason.

01:03:13.115 --> 01:03:14.982
I did.

01:03:14.984 --> 01:03:17.952
And he refuses to help unless we
restore the original ending.

01:03:17.954 --> 01:03:19.921
Which, no, we cannot do.

01:03:21.791 --> 01:03:25.727
No. No, no, Trudie.
No, forget it. I'm not doing it.

01:03:25.729 --> 01:03:27.228
I know, it's not ideal.

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:28.796
Ideal? You fired me!

01:03:28.798 --> 01:03:30.131
Not officially, not yet.

01:03:30.133 --> 01:03:32.233
And if you agree to help,
I'm willing to let you off

01:03:32.235 --> 01:03:35.270
with just a little formal reprimand
and that's it...

01:03:35.272 --> 01:03:37.972
Okay, two weeks' suspension.
That's if...

01:03:37.974 --> 01:03:39.674
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't do it.

01:03:39.676 --> 01:03:41.709
You started this.

01:03:41.711 --> 01:03:43.679
Are you going
to really sit back

01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:46.215
and let everyone else
pay for your mistakes?

01:03:46.217 --> 01:03:49.952
I need you,
the kids need you to...

01:03:49.954 --> 01:03:53.655
To just step up and be a
goddamned teacher here.

01:03:53.657 --> 01:03:57.159
And if you can't do that,
you have no business in a classroom.

01:04:02.899 --> 01:04:05.068
I want to think about it.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:06.102
Well...

01:04:06.104 --> 01:04:08.839
I expect you there at 3:00.

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:12.943
Okay. This is the last
chance you're gonna get.

01:04:26.359 --> 01:04:30.127
<i>Hey, Ms. Sinclair, I wanna bend you
over your desk!</i>

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.668
"Mother. Oh, my dear mother.
How could you..."

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:39.004
No, no. Come on. Come on.
It's got to be louder.

01:04:39.006 --> 01:04:41.739
You got to get them in the cheap seats.
Come on. Loud.

01:04:41.741 --> 01:04:46.211
Come on, support it. "How could
you abandon me to such a cruel..."

01:04:49.115 --> 01:04:51.850
Thank God.
All right, listen up, people.

01:04:51.852 --> 01:04:55.220
Ms. Sinclair is going to
take over from here on out.

01:04:55.222 --> 01:04:57.989
But listen, I'm going to be sitting
here in the front row,

01:04:57.991 --> 01:05:00.659
and I don't want
any funny business, okay?

01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:02.760
Is that clear?

01:05:02.762 --> 01:05:04.161
Yes, Mr. Pelaski.

01:05:11.772 --> 01:05:13.452
Could somebody please
tell me where we are?

01:05:14.641 --> 01:05:16.008
We're doing the new ending.

01:05:17.811 --> 01:05:19.779
New ending?

01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:22.449
Yeah, Carl wrote it. They were
working on it when he collapsed.

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:27.820
Yeah, as long as nobody kills
themselves, it's good with me.

01:05:35.864 --> 01:05:37.464
Fine. Let's just do this.

01:05:39.033 --> 01:05:40.434
Go ahead.

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.336
Do you have any direction?

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:47.242
You're in pain.

01:05:48.943 --> 01:05:50.811
You're in deep,
unbearable pain.

01:05:53.314 --> 01:05:55.315
"Mother! Oh, my dear mother!"

01:05:55.317 --> 01:05:57.818
"How could you abandon
me to such a cruel fate!"

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.088
Okay, Halle. "A father
who couldn't love me!"

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.323
"A world where I'd never belong!"
That's enough.

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:04.692
"Oh, God! I want to die..."

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:07.462
No, my darling!
You must live! Live!

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:10.065
Knock it off, both of you!

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:12.334
- Take it seriously.
- Why?

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:15.237
It sucks. This ending sucks.

01:06:15.239 --> 01:06:18.507
My grandparents are coming in
from Tucson to see me suck.

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:21.877
This isn't Jason's play anymore.
It's bullshit.

01:06:21.879 --> 01:06:23.079
Hey! Language.

01:06:24.916 --> 01:06:26.249
Where's Jason?

01:06:26.251 --> 01:06:27.851
We want Jason back.

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:32.222
Okay, that's it. One week
detention, Miss Anderson!

01:06:55.113 --> 01:06:56.914
Yes. I'm coming.

01:07:02.154 --> 01:07:04.889
<i>Jason, please don't make
me stand outside.</i>

01:07:04.891 --> 01:07:08.425
<i>I'm gonna... I'm not going to leave
here until we talk.</i>

01:07:12.966 --> 01:07:14.766
May I come in?

01:07:14.768 --> 01:07:16.001
Yeah.

01:07:23.876 --> 01:07:25.410
May I have a glass of water?

01:07:36.322 --> 01:07:38.558
- I'm here to ask for a favor.
- Are you kidding me?

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.126
If you could just
write a new ending.

01:07:40.128 --> 01:07:42.061
No. No. No.

01:07:42.063 --> 01:07:44.230
- Write a new ending?
- Jason, please...

01:07:44.232 --> 01:07:46.465
For what? To make it happy?
To make it cute and safe?

01:07:46.467 --> 01:07:50.169
I understand that, but I'm in an
untenable situation here...

01:07:50.171 --> 01:07:54.307
slap a feel-good ending
on Death of a Salesman.

01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:55.942
Does he really have to die?

01:07:55.944 --> 01:07:57.310
This isn't helping anyone.

01:07:57.312 --> 01:07:58.478
That's because
nothing's gonna help.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.081
Everything's fucked,
and it's your fault!

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:03.817
I want to kill myself.

01:08:03.819 --> 01:08:05.252
That's not an answer, Jason.

01:08:06.988 --> 01:08:08.628
What makes you think
you have the answers?

01:08:10.891 --> 01:08:13.359
I mean, who are you, anyway?

01:08:13.361 --> 01:08:16.264
Who gets a power trip
lecturing teenagers.

01:08:18.434 --> 01:08:22.304
You really think you affect their
lives by reading them Emerson?

01:08:23.973 --> 01:08:25.506
You're a joke.

01:08:25.509 --> 01:08:26.975
They don't respect you.

01:08:28.278 --> 01:08:30.645
The second they finish high school,
they forget you.

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.620
Yes...

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:42.358
Well...

01:08:44.261 --> 01:08:48.598
I was thinking about your ending,
and I realized that there

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.170
may be something that I missed
in previous readings of your play.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:54.970
And that is...

01:08:54.973 --> 01:08:57.273
That the ending sucks.

01:08:57.274 --> 01:08:59.140
What?

01:08:59.143 --> 01:09:03.279
Everyone kills themselves?
That's your resolution?

01:09:03.281 --> 01:09:06.249
Jason, come on.
What do you think?

01:09:08.051 --> 01:09:09.553
You said, you loved the ending.

01:09:09.555 --> 01:09:14.024
Well, you know, I do make mistakes,
as you know.

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:17.194
Whatever. I'm done with this.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:19.563
You know, sometimes
you can't run away.

01:09:19.564 --> 01:09:21.430
And you can't go to law school.

01:09:21.433 --> 01:09:24.167
And you can't kill yourself.

01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:27.604
Because sometimes you have to stay
and suck it up.

01:09:27.606 --> 01:09:29.573
- Fuck you!
- Can you just try?

01:09:29.576 --> 01:09:33.578
I mean, can you imagine that
there might be another ending?

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:37.314
A different ending,
where everyone doesn't die.

01:09:39.952 --> 01:09:42.286
No! Get the fuck
out of my house!

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Hmun dang zawng aia tlawma
Air Tickets la duh tan.

01:10:20.002 --> 01:10:27.002
In/Office lamah pawh a thlawnin
tickets kan dahsak thei.

01:11:12.549 --> 01:11:15.083
This is horrible.
They're gonna hate it.

01:11:15.085 --> 01:11:18.286
Halle... I can't, I can't,
I can't do this!

01:11:18.288 --> 01:11:21.357
No, no. I can't... I can't remember
any of my lines.

01:11:21.359 --> 01:11:25.395
Just say them the way we rehearsed
them last week and you'll be terrific.

01:11:25.397 --> 01:11:27.430
I know. I heard you.

01:11:27.432 --> 01:11:29.232
- All right?
- Thank you.

01:11:29.234 --> 01:11:30.700
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:11:30.702 --> 01:11:32.536
All right. Five minutes.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.772
It's five minutes, everyone.

01:11:34.774 --> 01:11:36.506
All right, you've
worked really hard.

01:11:36.508 --> 01:11:38.141
And you know what to do.

01:11:38.143 --> 01:11:39.709
And you're going to be great.

01:11:39.711 --> 01:11:42.645
And you should all feel
so proud of yourselves.

01:11:42.647 --> 01:11:46.450
- Hello, my children of the night.
- Mr. Kapinas!

01:11:46.452 --> 01:11:47.684
I'm back.

01:11:47.686 --> 01:11:49.453
Mr. Kapinas, you made it.

01:11:49.455 --> 01:11:52.222
Wild horses couldn't
keep me away.

01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:54.424
Dear, dear Linda.

01:11:54.426 --> 01:11:57.095
I am eternally grateful
for all your help,

01:11:57.097 --> 01:11:59.164
and understanding.

01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:01.598
It was no problem. How are you?

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:04.101
Much better, thank you.
Fully rested,

01:12:04.103 --> 01:12:07.204
mildly medicated and ready
to resume my duties.

01:12:07.206 --> 01:12:09.374
Well, I think,
everything's under control.

01:12:09.376 --> 01:12:13.611
Don't worry,
I've done this a thousand times.

01:12:13.613 --> 01:12:15.747
Why don't you relax?
Take a seat, enjoy the show.

01:12:15.749 --> 01:12:18.116
Thespians. It's time.

01:12:18.118 --> 01:12:19.517
Prayer circle of love
and commitment?

01:12:19.519 --> 01:12:21.453
Prayer circle of love
and commitment.

01:12:23.622 --> 01:12:26.325
My future Tony Award winners,

01:12:26.327 --> 01:12:27.493
let's all take a deep breath.

01:12:29.863 --> 01:12:31.864
Let it go.

01:12:31.866 --> 01:12:33.432
Focus.

01:12:33.434 --> 01:12:35.268
And as Meryl Streep once said,

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:38.205
when we were doing
Shakespeare in the Park,

01:12:38.207 --> 01:12:40.106
"Speak up!"

01:12:55.156 --> 01:12:56.790
Here we are.

01:12:59.661 --> 01:13:01.929
Next year, we are definitely
doing Our Town.

01:13:27.724 --> 01:13:29.826
Why are you not
at the hospital?

01:13:46.843 --> 01:13:48.878
- Are you going in?
- I'm too nervous.

01:13:54.486 --> 01:13:59.554
<i>They were pink roses. That must be
a good sign, I'm sure of it!</i>

01:13:59.556 --> 01:14:03.605
<i>No, Jane. She's gone.
She died this morning.</i>

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.895
I don't understand, you said she was
getting better. You...

01:14:05.897 --> 01:14:08.197
She took a turn.

01:14:08.199 --> 01:14:10.466
<i>No. No.</i>

01:14:10.468 --> 01:14:13.203
<i>I'm sorry.
It happened so suddenly.</i>

01:14:13.205 --> 01:14:14.872
<i>She never woke up again.</i>

01:14:14.874 --> 01:14:16.907
<i>Then, she was gone.</i>

01:14:16.909 --> 01:14:18.375
<i>But I never got to say goodbye.</i>

01:14:18.377 --> 01:14:20.476
<i>You told me that, I would see her
one last time.</i>

01:14:20.478 --> 01:14:21.644
Why didn't you come get me?

01:14:21.646 --> 01:14:23.613
It would not have
changed anything.

01:14:23.615 --> 01:14:25.749
<i>I could have been there to tell her
that I love her.</i>

01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:27.885
<i>I could have held her hand so she
wouldn't have felt so alone.</i>

01:14:27.887 --> 01:14:29.887
<i>Jane, control yourself.</i>

01:14:29.889 --> 01:14:31.990
<i>I must prepare for the funeral.</i>

01:14:31.992 --> 01:14:33.625
<i>It's time to move on.</i>

01:14:38.398 --> 01:14:39.865
<i>I never knew my mother.</i>

01:14:39.867 --> 01:14:41.967
<i>But she was beautiful...</i>

01:14:43.002 --> 01:14:45.704
<i>She loved bright
and colorful things.</i>

01:14:45.706 --> 01:14:48.340
<i>Here. I'll give you
your favorite colors.</i>

01:14:48.342 --> 01:14:50.609
<i>Green for her wings.</i>

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:53.512
<i>Green with flecks of gold,
just like her eyes.</i>

01:14:59.252 --> 01:15:00.786
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Margaret.

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:06.959
Did you hear me?
I said step away!

01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:09.328
Damn it, Jane!

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:13.866
That's not me.

01:15:33.822 --> 01:15:36.724
Mother. I'm ready.

01:15:36.726 --> 01:15:39.294
Yes, daughter.
Come away with me.

01:15:39.296 --> 01:15:41.663
You'll never belong
in this world.

01:15:41.665 --> 01:15:46.402
<i>All the pain and the fear
and the loneliness.</i>

01:15:46.404 --> 01:15:48.536
We'll be together, always.

01:15:50.305 --> 01:15:51.739
Jane! Get away.

01:15:51.741 --> 01:15:53.641
<i>- Please listen to me.
- Get out!</i>

01:15:53.643 --> 01:15:55.710
<i>You ruined everything.
My entire life.</i>

01:15:55.712 --> 01:15:58.446
<i>I know, I've made mistakes.
I'm sorry.</i>

01:15:58.448 --> 01:16:01.983
<i>I wish I could go back and change
what happened, but I can't.</i>

01:16:01.985 --> 01:16:04.853
<i>Please, Jane,
I'm asking for another chance.</i>

01:16:04.855 --> 01:16:07.923
<i>It's not too late...
I know you want to run away,</i>

01:16:07.925 --> 01:16:09.992
<i>I know you want to punish me,</i>

01:16:09.994 --> 01:16:11.960
<i>maybe I deserve it...</i>

01:16:13.496 --> 01:16:15.997
It's better than I thought...

01:16:15.999 --> 01:16:18.467
<i>You do deserve it!
You're the monster. Not me!</i>

01:16:18.469 --> 01:16:21.003
<i>I know... I know, I am.
I'm so sorry...</i>

01:16:21.005 --> 01:16:22.704
What the fuck is this?

01:16:22.706 --> 01:16:24.206
Jason.

01:16:31.415 --> 01:16:33.083
At least in New York they didn't
give a shit about my play,

01:16:33.085 --> 01:16:34.517
they didn't try to destroy it.

01:16:34.519 --> 01:16:36.020
It's not destroyed.
It's still your play.

01:16:36.022 --> 01:16:37.821
You've ruined the
whole point of the story.

01:16:37.823 --> 01:16:41.125
Jason, I was wrong. I didn't know
what to do, or how to fix it.

01:16:41.127 --> 01:16:43.360
And I'm sorry.

01:16:43.362 --> 01:16:46.363
I am truly, truly sorry.

01:16:46.365 --> 01:16:50.267
Please don't let my mistakes stand
in the way of your success.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.658
Thank you.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.762
You were wonderful.

01:18:19.093 --> 01:18:20.862
Author! Author!

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.867
He means you.

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:31.372
Go on.

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:36.711
There he is.

01:19:34.307 --> 01:19:36.008
Ms. Sinclair.

01:19:37.277 --> 01:19:39.144
Nice work.

01:19:39.146 --> 01:19:40.312
Thank you.

01:19:41.214 --> 01:19:43.247
May I apologize
for my behavior?

01:19:43.249 --> 01:19:45.851
Oh, no. Forget about it, it wasn't my
finest moment either.

01:19:45.853 --> 01:19:49.555
I shouldn't have believed that stuff
from the play. I was ridiculous.

01:19:49.557 --> 01:19:50.790
I'm very sorry.

01:19:52.293 --> 01:19:54.227
Apology accepted.

01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:55.695
Thank you.

01:19:55.697 --> 01:19:57.697
It's actually true.

01:19:58.832 --> 01:20:01.001
Sort of.

01:20:01.003 --> 01:20:03.237
About the play.

01:20:03.239 --> 01:20:05.039
I wasn't a great dad.

01:20:06.708 --> 01:20:10.742
Pushed him to do all the things
I wanted him to do.

01:20:10.744 --> 01:20:12.378
I'm sure, you did your best.

01:20:13.314 --> 01:20:16.115
I dated some crazy women.
None of them Irish.

01:20:16.117 --> 01:20:18.084
But...

01:20:18.086 --> 01:20:20.253
Creative license, I guess.

01:20:20.255 --> 01:20:22.922
Anyway, we learn from
our mistakes, right?

01:20:22.924 --> 01:20:24.725
Yes, we do.

01:20:26.261 --> 01:20:28.429
- Good luck with everything.
- Thank you.

01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:39.773
<i>And so, Linda Sinclair resumed
her life as a schoolteacher.</i>

01:20:39.775 --> 01:20:42.910
<i>Though she brought a new,
modern approach to her craft.</i>

01:20:42.912 --> 01:20:45.312
Now that you've
all finished the reading,

01:20:45.314 --> 01:20:48.751
let's try a little
creative writing exercise.

01:20:48.753 --> 01:20:52.787
I'd like you all to write a new
ending to A Tale of Two Cities.

01:20:52.789 --> 01:20:55.156
Now, it could be
anything you like.

01:20:55.158 --> 01:20:58.293
So let your
imaginations run wild.

01:20:58.295 --> 01:21:00.295
<i>She often saw Dr. Sherwood,</i>

01:21:00.297 --> 01:21:04.633
<i>though propriety dictated that
she maintain a respectable distance</i>

01:21:04.635 --> 01:21:09.038
<i>from the father of the young man
with whom she'd so disgraced herself.</i>

01:21:13.678 --> 01:21:16.011
That's a good biography.

01:21:16.013 --> 01:21:17.913
I have a copy if you
want to borrow it.

01:21:18.982 --> 01:21:21.984
- You're a fan?
- Of Conan Doyle?

01:21:21.986 --> 01:21:23.853
- Of course.
- Me too.

01:21:23.855 --> 01:21:25.689
Since I was a kid.

01:21:25.691 --> 01:21:28.759
<i>And that was the end of it.</i>

01:21:28.761 --> 01:21:30.761
How are you?

01:21:30.763 --> 01:21:32.396
I'm pretty good, thanks.

01:21:34.832 --> 01:21:37.300
Hey, would you like to grab
a cup of coffee or something?

01:21:37.302 --> 01:21:38.669
<i>Naturally...</i>

01:21:39.705 --> 01:21:41.204
<i>She refused.</i>

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.040
Okay. Why not.

01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:47.878
<i>And so they spoke in
a strictly impersonal way.</i>

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.414
She did some crazy stuff.

01:21:49.416 --> 01:21:52.818
She had a yard sale one time when
I was out of town,

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:55.320
and sold my entire collection of
Ellery Queen first editions.

01:21:55.322 --> 01:21:57.222
- Oh, no!
- Yes!

01:21:58.358 --> 01:22:02.026
That's when I knew the marriage
was kinda over.

01:22:02.028 --> 01:22:04.329
<i>They did not discuss the boy.</i>

01:22:04.331 --> 01:22:06.098
- Jason's doing really well.
- Is he?

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.467
Yeah, yeah, he's actually written
another piece.

01:22:08.469 --> 01:22:12.304
And he's work shopping it in a
children's theater in New Jersey.

01:22:12.306 --> 01:22:15.208
I mean, you may or may not realize
some references to Orwell,

01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:16.709
and Kafka in the first act...

01:22:16.711 --> 01:22:18.377
Oh, that's so wonderful.

01:22:18.379 --> 01:22:20.145
Can I be honest
with you about something?

01:22:20.147 --> 01:22:21.914
<i>I knew it.</i>

01:22:21.916 --> 01:22:29.021
The whole time we're strolling along here,
I keep thinking...

01:22:29.023 --> 01:22:32.758
You know,
you slept with my son.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:38.263
I understand that it was just one
of those things or whatever, but...

01:22:39.967 --> 01:22:42.402
I guess, what I am
trying to say is...

01:22:45.039 --> 01:22:46.873
I still think
you're pretty great.

01:22:46.875 --> 01:22:48.740
What?

01:22:48.742 --> 01:22:50.275
Yeah.

01:22:50.277 --> 01:22:54.014
And if it's not too weird...

01:22:54.016 --> 01:22:56.150
For you, or me...

01:22:56.152 --> 01:23:00.955
Walter Mosley's speaking over at
Wilkes next week, and I thought maybe...

01:23:00.957 --> 01:23:04.325
<i>Linda Sinclair.
What are you doing?</i>

01:23:04.327 --> 01:23:07.796
<i>You belong here.
At home. Alone.</i>

01:23:07.798 --> 01:23:09.431
<i>You don't want to go out there.</i>

01:23:09.433 --> 01:23:12.433
<i>It's a cruel and
unforgiving world.</i>

01:23:12.435 --> 01:23:13.534
<i>Linda.</i>

01:23:13.536 --> 01:23:15.302
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi.

01:23:15.304 --> 01:23:16.403
Linda.

01:23:16.405 --> 01:23:17.939
You look great.

01:23:17.941 --> 01:23:19.374
Thank you.

01:23:19.376 --> 01:23:21.443
Are you ready?

01:23:21.445 --> 01:23:23.078
Yes, I am.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.980
<i>Linda? Are you listening to me?
Don't be a fool!</i>
