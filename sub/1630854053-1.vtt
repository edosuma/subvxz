00:15.473 --> 00:17.976
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:19.561 --> 00:20.729
Whoo-hoo!

00:20.812 --> 00:22.439
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

00:24.274 --> 00:25.692
(LAUGHS)

00:25.775 --> 00:28.069
Whoo! (EXCLAIMING)

00:28.153 --> 00:29.237
-Bye!
-(SHOUTS)

00:29.320 --> 00:30.697
Mater, what are you doing?

00:30.780 --> 00:32.574
Just letting you know I'm going to be gone

00:32.657 --> 00:35.785
'cause I'm heading back east
to go to my sister's wedding.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.954
-Anyway, bye.
-Oh.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.331
Wait a minute. You have a sister?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.208
RAMONE: Whoa!

00:42.292 --> 00:44.002
FLO: I'd say
Mater's been holding out on us.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.962
Mater is a complicated guy.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.048
<i>Mamma mia!</i> Mater has a sister?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.674
Boggles the mind, man.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.054
Mater, it must be ages
since you've seen her.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.472
You've got that right.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.182
That'll put pressure on the reunion.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.267
Oh, boy, if you only knew.

00:59.350 --> 01:02.562
Ain't nothing better than a wedding
to bring folks together.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.647
Family is a precious thing, man.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.860
Yeah, well, honestly, my sister and I
don't get along too well, and...

01:08.985 --> 01:12.947
(SIGHS) This is one trip
that I ain't looking forward to.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.076
Hey, Mater, I was thinking.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.869
What if I go with you?

01:17.952 --> 01:19.704
Really? You'd do that?

01:19.788 --> 01:22.165
Sure. Let's make it a road trip.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.375
-We'll take Mack.
-(RELAXING MUSIC PLAYING)

01:24.459 --> 01:28.171
We'll relax, stretch out on the trailer.
We'll be there in no time.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.216
Well, shoot.
That ain't a real road trip.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.926
-We got to drive it ourselves...
-Uh...

01:33.009 --> 01:34.135
...take our time.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.804
-But...
-Wander the backroads.

01:35.887 --> 01:36.888
Make new friends.

01:36.971 --> 01:40.225
-Yeah, I get it. It's just...
-I knew you'd see it my way, buddy.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.393
Oh, you've got to stop
at the Trees of Mystery.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.978
(LAUGHS) It'll blow your mind, man.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.648
Oh, yeah. We're going to see
all the places.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.818
There is a palace made
entirely of rotini pasta.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.444
-Ah. <i>Bellissima.</i>
-Sounds delicious.

01:51.569 --> 01:55.740
Make sure you stop by New Orleans
for some of that sweet jazz, baby.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.408
-(FLO SCATTING)
-Uh...

01:57.492 --> 01:59.536
What have I gotten myself into?

01:59.619 --> 02:01.412
(LAUGHS) I think you just agreed

02:01.538 --> 02:03.373
to drive cross-country
with your best friend.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.791
Well, sure, in Mack's trailer,

02:04.874 --> 02:07.001
but this is a bit more
than I signed up for.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.088
I mean, I... I love Mater,
but that's a lot of Mater.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.006
...and it was all bumpy-like.
Almost like...

02:12.090 --> 02:13.591
-(BLABBERING)
-(LAUGHTER)

02:14.008 --> 02:17.053
Don't look at me. I could use a break
without either one of you.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.681
-(LAUGHS)
-Hey, Ramone can fix you up

02:19.764 --> 02:21.558
with a new look for the trip.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.227
-McQueen. It's paint time. <i>Vamanos.</i>
-(FLO LAUGHS)

02:24.394 --> 02:25.979
So, what's it going to be?

02:26.771 --> 02:29.274
Well, I guess it's settled.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.068
McQueen and Mater are hittin' the road.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.738
MAN: (SINGING)

-Whoo-hoo!
<i>-Ever together, cars on the road</i>

02:54.257 --> 02:57.802
Okay, So how come you never mentioned
(LAUGHS) this sister of yours?

02:57.886 --> 03:02.182
Well, I don't think about her that much,
until she turns up,

03:02.390 --> 03:04.309
like any other natural disaster.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.728
Mater, that's no way
to talk about your sister.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.439
(GASPS) You're right.
She's going to know somehow.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.274
And then when she sees me, she's gonna...

03:11.357 --> 03:13.610
Wait, you're not (LAUGHS) afraid of her?

03:13.693 --> 03:16.112
Nah, I ain't scared of nothing. (YELPS)

03:16.905 --> 03:18.448
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

03:19.073 --> 03:20.200
(BOTH SIGH)

03:20.283 --> 03:21.326
Whoa!

03:21.409 --> 03:23.036
It's a Dino Park.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.580
I love these. Let's go see.

03:25.663 --> 03:29.000
Uh, I don't know.
Seems kind of like school.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.586
Ah, come on.
Look, you picked the last three stops.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.296
World's largest tire maze.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.380
-McQueen!
-Mater!

03:34.505 --> 03:35.632
-McQueen!
-Mater?

03:35.715 --> 03:36.716
McQueen!

03:36.799 --> 03:38.051
World's largest lug nut.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.303
Behold the majesty.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.388
Not to mention, Carhenge.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.141
-(CRASHING)
-The sign said, "Don't Touch!"

03:45.225 --> 03:49.062
Uh, anyway, I don't know much
about these dino things.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.397
Well, that's all about to change.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.568
Oh! The old barn dweller.
Quadratorquosaur.

03:56.152 --> 03:59.322
Notice how the dorsal plates
were arranged to fend off an attack.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.910
The Westfalanapus
were the first grazing dino vans.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.496
They traveled in herds for safety.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.123
How do you know all this anyway?

04:09.207 --> 04:12.377
Hours of intense scientific research,
my friend.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.546
<i>The Westfalanapus</i>

04:15.630 --> 04:18.132

04:18.258 --> 04:20.760
Ugh. Do they at least
have a snack bar here?

04:20.843 --> 04:24.555

Who knows? Maybe you'll learn something.

04:42.532 --> 04:46.953
This specimen 536M,
we affectionately refer to as Mimi.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.790
Hers is the most complete skeletal example
of a compact theropod.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.292
-Oh, dear mother.
-Shh.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.837
Uh, isn't it true that Mimi's species
survived the asteroid event

04:55.920 --> 04:58.923
that eradicated other plains-dwelling
sedans in the region?

04:59.007 --> 05:00.216
(YAWNS)

05:00.758 --> 05:02.760
Oh, yes, (CLEARS THROAT)
that is partially true.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.931
And while the theropods survived,
there were other conditions.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.517

I'm all up in it.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.540
Lightning! What happened to you?

05:32.623 --> 05:36.336
Mater, everyone knows
there were 50 million years

05:36.419 --> 05:38.796
between the dino cars
and the more advanced models.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.381
-So?
-So I'm saying

05:40.465 --> 05:43.134
this scenario is
scientifically impossible.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.053
-(ROARING)

05:46.804 --> 05:49.682

Oh, I got to get a closer look.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.978
Uh, I wouldn't go near that critter.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.730
(GROWLING)

Once that dadgum Tyranamissiasaurus Rex
got his teeth into you,

07:05.258 --> 07:08.845
and the Spinocrankshaftorex had showed up,
I was fairly convinced

07:08.928 --> 07:10.179
(LAUGHS) you was toast.

07:12.223 --> 07:15.393
Well, what do you know,
I guess I accidentally learned stuff.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.770
My mind does feel a bit puffy.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.814
Well, now that you've had
