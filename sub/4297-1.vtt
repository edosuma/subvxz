01:10.180 --> 01:13.104
Move a little to the left, please.

01:21.060 --> 01:25.040
Adele, you are restless.

01:25.140 --> 01:29.200
I worry too much, you know that.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.745
About what?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.910
The future.

01:54.820 --> 01:58.400
My sister, Luise,
we really loved each other,

01:58.500 --> 02:01.720
but the truth is
we were always competing.

02:01.820 --> 02:05.541
If life is a race, then she has
beaten me to the finishing line.

02:05.660 --> 02:08.120
But if it is a boxing match,

02:08.220 --> 02:10.280
then I am the last one standing.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.480
Either way, we went through
a great deal together,

02:17.580 --> 02:19.981
and I will miss you.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.381
Auf Wiedersehen, liebe Schwester.

02:31.220 --> 02:34.360
Barbara, thank you so much
for coming. It means a lot to me.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.827
Our families go back a long way.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.880
Your son, the lawyer, how is he?

02:39.980 --> 02:42.400
Oh, struggling, I'm afraid.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.160
After law school, he went
to work for a fancy firm,

02:45.260 --> 02:47.920
and then decided to go
out on his own in Pasadena.

02:48.020 --> 02:50.040
- And what happened?
- It all fell apart.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.520
Oh...

02:51.620 --> 02:55.400
Add those debts to seven years
of student loans, and things aren't great.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.000
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.120
You need a lawyer?

02:59.220 --> 03:02.920
Just some letters I found
in my sister's belongings.

03:03.020 --> 03:05.400
I need advice from someone I can trust.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.025
I'll have him call you.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.640
I really feel...

03:14.740 --> 03:19.746
I really feel like, with a firm
such as this, sir, that I... I would be...

03:20.687 --> 03:22.684
...ready and willing to...

03:25.180 --> 03:27.040
Hello?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.280
No, not a, not a, not a good time, Mom.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.348
Not a good time;
I'll call, call you later.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.400
Well, she's got all of the reports...

03:48.820 --> 03:52.280
Hi, Randy Schoenberg here
to see Bergen, Brown and Sherman.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.120
- Okay.
- I'd like to make

03:54.220 --> 03:56.000
the most of the opportunities
offered here.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.720
With a firm as impressive
as this, I'd be extremely motivated

03:58.820 --> 04:01.040
to deliver my very best
each and every day.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.760
You any relation to the
famous composer, Schoenberg?

04:03.860 --> 04:06.040
Arnold was my grandfather, sir.

04:06.140 --> 04:07.680
But he died before I was born.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.440
His music demands
a certain quality of application.

04:10.540 --> 04:13.400
But the rewards validate the effort.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.800
One of the things I'd most
look forward to about, uh,

04:15.900 --> 04:17.480
working here is exploring
your larger scale...

04:17.579 --> 04:20.310
And Judge Schoenberg is your father.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.680
Retired now, yes, sir.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.760
Outstanding lineage, Mr. Schoenberg.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.191
Yes, sir.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.160
What happened in Pasadena?

04:29.260 --> 04:31.024
Well, I took a risk.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.280
Set up my own law firm,
and it didn't pay off, you know.

04:34.380 --> 04:36.280
Working for yourself
isn't all it's hyped up to be.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.640
So now you're ready to work with others?

04:38.740 --> 04:40.310
Yes, sir.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.386
Well, let's give it a go,
Mr. Schoenberg.

04:55.140 --> 04:56.790
Thanks, Mom.

05:03.820 --> 05:06.760
I was expecting you at 6:00.
It's ten past.

05:06.860 --> 05:09.920
My apologies, Mrs. Altmann.
It was gridlock on Wilshire.

05:10.020 --> 05:13.069
You look tired and stressed,
but you're not bad-looking.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.280
You were such a skinny boy.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.440
Thank you.

05:15.540 --> 05:18.862
So, what do you know
about art restitution?

05:18.980 --> 05:20.400
Not a thing.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.720
Well, it's never too late to learn.

05:22.820 --> 05:24.240
Why don't you come on inside.

05:24.340 --> 05:26.480
Have some strudel.
I made it specially for you.

05:51.380 --> 05:55.360
My sister is the pretty little girl
on the left, Luise.

05:55.460 --> 05:57.747
And I am the moody one, next to her.

05:59.740 --> 06:03.880
My parents, Therese and Gustav.

06:03.980 --> 06:07.800
My uncle Ferdinand,
who owned a sugar company,

06:07.900 --> 06:12.144
and his wife, Aunt Adele,
who died so young.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.640
Sit with me, Maria.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.280
Adele didn't have any children,

06:16.380 --> 06:18.400
so we all lived together as one family.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.280
In a way, I had two sets of parents.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.440
Try to smile, Maria.

06:23.540 --> 06:27.120
It's good to exercise
your facial muscles once a year.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.302
The Bloch-Bauers.

06:34.340 --> 06:38.320
I found these letters
amongst my sister's belongings.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.000
Look, I've translated them
for you, on the back.

06:43.060 --> 06:44.160
1948?

06:44.260 --> 06:47.680
From our family lawyer in Vienna,
Johann Rinesch.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.909
All about our paintings
that were stolen by the Nazis.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.200
Okay.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.640
I read in The New York Times

06:55.740 --> 06:57.760
that things are changing in Austria.

06:57.860 --> 06:58.880
How are they changing?

06:58.980 --> 07:01.840
They're redrafting
the art restitution laws.

07:01.940 --> 07:04.307
Reviewing old cases.

07:07.780 --> 07:10.120
My sister finally moves in with me.

07:10.220 --> 07:14.111
The only problem is she decides
to do it when she's dead.

07:14.220 --> 07:17.200
Well, at least you won't be
having any arguments that way.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.760
What I mean is-is that,
you know how roommates,

07:22.860 --> 07:25.600
they tend to argue about dishes
in the sink and stuff and...

07:25.700 --> 07:28.040
and you won't be having any arguments,

07:28.140 --> 07:30.560
because, about dishes,
'cause, you know...

07:30.660 --> 07:31.840
'cause she's dead.

07:31.940 --> 07:33.440
So...

07:34.488 --> 07:36.720
I'm so sorry. I'm... I was trying...
I was making a joke and it didn't, uh...

07:36.820 --> 07:38.231
Ah, here she is.

07:40.380 --> 07:43.190
My Aunt Adele.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.907
My uncle commissioned
Gustav Klimt to paint her.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.080
That's quite a painting.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.420
It's magnificent.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.440
She was taken off the walls
of our home by the Nazis,

07:57.540 --> 07:59.720
and since then, she's been hanging

07:59.820 --> 08:01.880
in the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.584
And now you'd like to be reunited.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.360
Wouldn't that be lovely?

08:06.460 --> 08:09.200
Make you a rich woman, I'm sure.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.223
You think that's what this is about?

08:14.300 --> 08:18.385
No, I have to do what I can
to keep these memories alive.

08:21.340 --> 08:23.468
Because people forget, you see.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.700
Especially the young.

08:30.460 --> 08:34.181
And then, of course, there's justice.

08:38.220 --> 08:40.600
I bored you to tears tonight.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.907
Four times you looked at your watch.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.480
You know, this was a test
and we both failed.

08:48.580 --> 08:52.240
I'm sorry. I-I-I, I'm sorry
I wasted your time.

08:52.340 --> 08:53.600
I got a new job today.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.760
A baby that keeps me up at night,
a wife I want to make happy.

08:56.860 --> 09:00.467
So why would you be interested
in ancient history?

09:01.700 --> 09:03.304
Good-bye, my dear.

09:04.620 --> 09:05.860
Struwwelpeter.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.200
Struwwelpeter, the book
that you had in your hand.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.560
My grandmother used to read that to me.

09:12.660 --> 09:17.120
Terrifying... the-the one about the boy
who gets swept away by the wind.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.480
Into a terrible adventure.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.264
Used to frighten me, too.

09:23.340 --> 09:26.040
Why don't you just take a look at these,

09:26.140 --> 09:27.680
and tell me if I have a case.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.020
That's all I ask from you.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.520
"11th of April, 1948.

09:35.620 --> 09:37.360
Dear Luise Bloch-Bauer..."

09:37.460 --> 09:39.000
That's her sister.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.920
"The Austrian government has decided

09:41.020 --> 09:43.280
"they will hold on to
the Klimt portrait of your aunt

09:43.380 --> 09:44.920
"and four other Klimts which they insist

09:45.020 --> 09:47.160
"were bequeathed to
the gallery in her will,

09:47.260 --> 09:50.120
"a fact which they claim
as incontestable.

09:50.220 --> 09:53.040
"The will itself...

09:53.140 --> 09:55.142
"I have not seen...

09:56.140 --> 09:58.400
"despite my persistent
attempts to do so.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.880
Yours sincerely, Johann Rinesch."

10:00.980 --> 10:02.360
Her lawyer never saw the will?

10:02.460 --> 10:04.269
Nobody saw the will.

10:14.260 --> 10:15.680
Randy!

10:15.780 --> 10:17.400
Hi, Mrs. Altmann. Hi.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.520
Uh, we just,
we just need to photocopy these

10:19.620 --> 10:22.040
just over here, okay?

10:22.140 --> 10:25.200
Everybody here looks as if they're
having nervous breakdowns.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.160
They are, they are.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.520
I was up till 3:00 a.m.
I did a little research for you.

10:29.620 --> 10:30.880
I'm impressed.

10:30.980 --> 10:32.880
Get someone on the ground in Vienna.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.840
For the first time in 50 years,
they've opened up the archives,

10:34.940 --> 10:36.760
so you start by trying
to find a copy of Adele's will.

10:36.860 --> 10:39.120
- Yes, and then what?
- The Austrian Ministry of Culture...

10:39.220 --> 10:40.680
will set up a committee to
review each case individually,

10:40.780 --> 10:42.440
but you need to fill out an application

10:42.540 --> 10:43.800
for them to consider you claim
by the end of next month...

10:43.900 --> 10:45.840
- ...at the latest.
- Next month?

10:45.940 --> 10:47.240
At the latest, yes; I've already
sent away for the form.

10:47.340 --> 10:49.480
Slow down.
You can explain everything to me...

10:49.580 --> 10:51.440
- ...over lunch.
- No.

10:51.540 --> 10:52.680
- Mrs. Altmann, I can't do lunch.
- I know a very nice place.

10:52.780 --> 10:55.306
They do excellent rice pudding.

10:57.180 --> 10:59.600
All right, these are three names

10:59.700 --> 11:02.280
of the top restitution lawyers
in America.

11:02.380 --> 11:05.160
They're gonna cost you,
but without them it's a nonstarter.

11:05.260 --> 11:08.120
No, no, all I have is my shop,
my bungalow and a little money

11:08.220 --> 11:10.320
I saved up for a new dishwasher.

11:10.420 --> 11:14.040
No, I can't go throwing cash
at fancy lawyers.

11:14.140 --> 11:17.160
Right, I-I have to go, so...

11:17.260 --> 11:19.720
Can't you just help me out
a little bit, on the side?

11:19.820 --> 11:21.600
You know, like a hobby.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.680
There is no "on the side" here, Maria.

11:24.780 --> 11:26.760
This is a full-time job;
this is not a hobby.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.320
You are quite rude,
you're a little uncouth,

11:29.420 --> 11:31.991
and you are completely
disinterested in the past.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.865
And you have an unusual talent
for making me feel good about myself.

11:34.980 --> 11:36.425
But you have the connection.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.120
What connection?

11:39.220 --> 11:41.360
Family, Randy.

11:41.460 --> 11:44.800
Your grandparents
came here from Austria.

11:44.900 --> 11:48.586
You see, we share the same history.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.320
Oh, how can you see
out of those glasses?

11:50.420 --> 11:52.741
They're filthy.

11:53.940 --> 11:57.865
Yes, that's better.
Help you see more clearly.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.000
I see this as a possible
investment for the firm.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.421
You really think a painting
that ends up as a fridge magnet

12:34.540 --> 12:36.040
will ever leave Austria?

12:36.140 --> 12:37.949
I think it'd be a mistake
not to take a look.

12:39.980 --> 12:41.880
One week, max.

12:41.980 --> 12:44.000
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.182
I want you back here on the third.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.984
Uh, absolutely, sir. Thank you.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.823
Still working?

12:59.940 --> 13:02.880
- I'll close the shop only when I croak.
- Big news.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.880
I got the green light.
I'm gonna go over there,

13:04.980 --> 13:07.631
I'm gonna try to find the will,
and then we'll take it from there.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.400
Oh! Randy!

13:09.500 --> 13:11.160
That's wonderful!

13:11.260 --> 13:13.200
You're chomping at the bite
all of a sudden.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.800
Yes, I am. And I have another idea.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.080
My mother sent this over.

13:18.180 --> 13:21.343
There's an art restitution conference
planned for later this month.

13:21.460 --> 13:22.840
They're looking for speakers.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.360
I think you should be one of them.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.280
- What are you talking about?
- Elegant descendant...

13:26.380 --> 13:28.040
from one of the great Viennese families.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.240
The press would love you.
It would speed things up.

13:30.340 --> 13:31.520
It'd apply pressure.

13:32.325 --> 13:33.680
Well...

13:33.780 --> 13:37.400
I love your enthusiasm, and,
after all, I'm not a spring chicken.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.480
We have to get a move on.

13:39.580 --> 13:42.789
But I'm afraid, in your haste,
there's been a misunderstanding.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.280
How's that?

13:44.380 --> 13:47.440
I'm not going back to that place.
Not now, not ever.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.520
I-I don't understand.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.760
They destroyed my family,

13:51.860 --> 13:53.760
they killed my friends,

13:53.860 --> 13:56.000
and they forced me to abandon

13:56.100 --> 13:58.360
the people and the places that I loved.

13:58.460 --> 14:00.240
That was over a half a century ago.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.720
You think that's a long time?

14:01.820 --> 14:04.840
It would be a few days, that's it.
We'd be in and out.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.960
Randy, you're not listening to me.

14:07.060 --> 14:08.960
I would rather die than go back there,

14:09.060 --> 14:12.030
not for all the paintings in the world.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.640
Anyway...

14:14.740 --> 14:17.080
a week ago, you weren't even
interested in the case,

14:17.180 --> 14:19.680
and now you're all over me
like a rash... what happened?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.828
Against my better judgment,

14:22.940 --> 14:24.783
I think I like you.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.720
For how long?

14:33.820 --> 14:37.840
Four or five days, a week at the most.
Depends on the reception I get.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.180
What's your plan?

14:40.740 --> 14:42.680
Dora... I'm not emigrating to the Congo,

14:42.780 --> 14:45.840
I'm going to Austria for a few days,
with the firm's blessing.

14:45.940 --> 14:47.920
What do you think?

14:51.300 --> 14:53.871
I think that's a yes.

15:39.660 --> 15:42.266
I see you, Maria. Come closer.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.987
Why don't you help your aunt?

15:49.380 --> 15:51.701
Put on my favorite necklace.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.751
Your little fingers
are perfect for the job.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.800
One day, you'll have to stop
being so timid.

16:02.900 --> 16:05.301
Life will demand it of you.

16:10.940 --> 16:14.661
Your only enemy is fear.

16:21.220 --> 16:23.680
- Hello?
- I know it's the middle...

16:23.780 --> 16:26.200
of the night,
but if I wait until the morning,

16:26.300 --> 16:27.960
I might change my mind.

16:28.060 --> 16:31.951
I have decided to face the ghosts.

16:35.860 --> 16:38.101
She's complicated.

16:54.820 --> 16:57.000
Oh, your mom called again this morning.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.600
She wants you to visit
the Holocaust Memorial when you're there.

16:59.700 --> 17:00.840
She mentioned it already, seven times.

17:00.940 --> 17:02.480
Well, she said to do it in honor...

17:02.580 --> 17:05.800
- ...of your great-grandparents.
- Siegmund and Malvina.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.680
Oh, she had the most
beautiful eyes, you know.

17:07.780 --> 17:09.440
Enormous, like an owl.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.240
This is an awfully big suitcase
you've packed, Maria.

17:11.339 --> 17:12.920
You sure you brought enough stuff?

17:13.020 --> 17:15.160
If I'm going back,
I might as well do it in style.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.240
Pam, darling,
could you drive a little faster?

17:17.339 --> 17:20.200
I, uh, I think, at this rate,
we're going to miss the plane.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.680
We're gonna be there four hours early.

17:21.780 --> 17:24.079
Yes, but I want to buy
perfume and cognac in duty-free.

17:24.180 --> 17:26.000
Look, move over there.

17:26.099 --> 17:28.600
Pam, darling, move over. Move over now.

17:28.700 --> 17:31.670
With pleasure, Mrs. Altmann.

18:06.100 --> 18:09.840
Ladies and gentleman,
we are about to land in Vienna.

18:09.940 --> 18:11.749
Please fasten your seatbelts.

18:16.340 --> 18:18.422
I never thought I'd come back.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.080
Some guy from the Ministry's

18:42.180 --> 18:46.280
agreed to meet me tomorrow...
I'm sure he's in charge of paper clips.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.760
We're lucky anyone
has agreed to meet us at all.

18:48.860 --> 18:51.160
You don't have to come,
if you don't want to.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.760
Oh, we haven't even arrived,

18:52.860 --> 18:55.040
and you're already trying
to get rid of me?

18:55.140 --> 18:57.440
That's not what I said... I just
meant you don't have to come.

18:57.540 --> 19:01.520
Anyway. I want to go
to the Belvedere to visit my aunt.

19:01.620 --> 19:04.464
You know, the postcard
doesn't do her justice.

19:31.980 --> 19:33.320
You were born in Vienna...

19:33.420 --> 19:35.343
- ...Mrs. Altmann?
- Yes, yes, I was, yes.

19:35.460 --> 19:36.920
Uh, just around the corner, yes.

19:37.020 --> 19:38.120
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

19:38.220 --> 19:40.680
Yes, but I choose to speak English.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.430
I hope you enjoy your stay.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.502
I'll certainly try.

19:50.984 --> 19:52.307
There it is.

19:53.580 --> 19:58.427
The apartment on the second floor,
that's our home.

20:01.020 --> 20:04.627
Oh, the things this house
has seen, Randy.

20:04.740 --> 20:09.680
Great artists, musicians, writers
passed through those doors.

20:09.780 --> 20:11.880
Including, of course, your grandfather.

20:11.980 --> 20:15.120
And Dr. Freud himself.

20:15.220 --> 20:19.066
On my wedding night,
half of Vienna was here.

20:23.380 --> 20:24.586
Mrs. Altmann?

20:25.580 --> 20:27.920
I spotted your name
on the list of speakers

20:28.020 --> 20:30.200
for the restitution conference
and tracked you down.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.240
And you are?

20:31.340 --> 20:33.800
Hubertus Czernin,
investigative reporter.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.560
- Welcome to Vienna.
- Thank you.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.662
Can I buy you a drink?

20:43.980 --> 20:45.040
I'm the editor.

20:45.140 --> 20:48.701
My little Austrian baby. Keeps me sane.

20:50.060 --> 20:52.320
When I wrote a piece
exposing the Nazi past

20:52.420 --> 20:54.080
of our own President Waldheim...

20:54.180 --> 20:58.000
a man walked up to me
in a supermarket and spat in my face.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.600
He called me a traitor.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.440
I said to him: "I'm a true Austrian."

21:02.540 --> 21:04.600
And what makes you
interested in a couple of...

21:04.700 --> 21:07.360
Californian tourists, Mr. Czernin?

21:07.460 --> 21:10.280
I just thought you could do
with an Austrian friend.

21:10.380 --> 21:11.560
What for?

21:11.660 --> 21:15.640
You know, this whole restitution thing
began as a PR exercise.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.640
Austria wanted to improve
its image abroad,

21:17.740 --> 21:20.869
but now it's turning
into a Pandora's box.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.960
They don't want to give away
their treasures.

21:23.060 --> 21:26.400
So they're going to put as many
obstacles in your way as possible,

21:26.500 --> 21:29.400
and I might just be able to help you
get over some of them.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.106
What's in it for you?
What's your motive?

21:33.220 --> 21:37.080
Let's just say it's a very
particular brand of patriotism.

21:37.180 --> 21:39.240
Now, if you will excuse me,

21:39.340 --> 21:41.400
I think I will treat us
to another round of drinks.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.390
Oh, yes, that's a wonderful idea.

22:17.900 --> 22:21.640
Tu che il zucchero porti

22:21.740 --> 22:24.120
In mezzo

22:24.220 --> 22:27.269
Al core

22:33.340 --> 22:36.200
Non esser, gioia

22:36.300 --> 22:38.760
Mia, con

22:38.860 --> 22:43.240
Me crudele

22:43.340 --> 22:45.640
Lasciati almen

22:45.740 --> 22:48.200
Veder

22:48.300 --> 22:53.511
Mio bell amore

23:03.140 --> 23:07.360
When our daughter Maria said
she was marrying an opera singer,

23:07.460 --> 23:10.360
we decided he would sing
Mozart at the wedding.

23:10.460 --> 23:13.720
Let's keep the whole thing
Austrian, I said.

23:15.580 --> 23:17.880
These are troubling times.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.760
Let us hope that this memorable evening

23:20.860 --> 23:24.160
is a harbinger of happier days.

23:24.260 --> 23:25.830
Mazel tov!

23:31.060 --> 23:34.667
It makes me sad
your Aunt Adele is not here today.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.589
She would have been proud of you.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.800
I am sad too, uncle.

23:38.900 --> 23:42.382
At least she's not alive to witness what
is happening to the country she loved.

23:44.180 --> 23:45.989
I want...

23:48.820 --> 23:51.903
you to have this, Maria.

23:53.020 --> 23:54.181
Her favorite.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.707
You are headstrong and inquiring.

24:12.900 --> 24:16.427
Something of Adele's spirit is in you.

24:18.060 --> 24:19.903
I will always treasure it.

24:21.780 --> 24:24.800
There you are, sister.
Come, Maria, it's time for cake.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.301
The whole world
has been looking for you.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.311
Quickly, I'm hungry.

24:29.420 --> 24:31.880
You have to help me cut it, Luise.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.560
That Maria of yours is a heart stealer.

24:35.940 --> 24:38.360
The Chancellor has conceded
on every front.

24:38.460 --> 24:41.320
Hitler has made an empty promise
about Austrian sovereignty.

24:41.420 --> 24:45.000
But my bet is that
by the end of the month

24:45.100 --> 24:49.080
the Nazis will be marching
round the Ringstrasse in their jackboots.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.228
The Austrians will not allow it.

24:52.740 --> 24:55.280
I will leave for Zurich on Sunday
with Luise.

24:55.380 --> 24:58.400
By next week,
the rest of you must join us.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.320
There will be much to do.
We must take our time.

25:01.420 --> 25:03.866
Like always, you are a dreamer.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.267
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

25:11.740 --> 25:12.720
Hey!

25:12.820 --> 25:14.360
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

26:05.020 --> 26:07.080
The restitution committee

26:07.180 --> 26:09.560
has decided your case
is worthy of a review,

26:09.660 --> 26:11.320
Mrs. Altmann.

26:11.420 --> 26:14.000
Young Mr. Schoenberg and I
have travelled all this way,

26:14.100 --> 26:16.200
so we would appreciate
discussing the case

26:16.300 --> 26:18.040
with the committee before
they make the decision.

26:18.140 --> 26:22.680
The committee does not interact
with external parties.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.280
And we are an external party, are we?

26:24.380 --> 26:27.040
The paintings belonged
to Mrs. Altmann's family.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.480
You must trust that all due
procedures will be followed.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.080
And now, if you don't mind,

26:32.180 --> 26:35.560
I have a reception to go to.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.520
Do enjoy your stay
in our beautiful city.

26:38.620 --> 26:41.920
It has been a real pleasure...

26:42.020 --> 26:43.863
to meet you.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.000
How you doing?

26:57.366 --> 27:00.440
I don't know if I have the strength
to deal with these people...

27:00.540 --> 27:02.542
and I've only been here a day.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.541
Come on, let's go.

27:09.620 --> 27:12.200
There's no way we're gonna get a copy

27:12.300 --> 27:13.920
of Adele's will before we have to leave.

27:14.020 --> 27:18.040
No. The archive department
was not exactly helpful.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.080
Well, thankfully, I have
what is commonly known

27:20.180 --> 27:22.148
as a mole at the Belvedere.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.103
Someone who can speed things up.

27:24.220 --> 27:26.109
On Mondays, the museum is closed,

27:26.220 --> 27:28.480
but my friendly mole
will be waiting for you.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.080
I hope you're not allergic
to a little dust.

27:31.180 --> 27:34.760
Now, I didn't I tell you he
was going to be useful, Randy?

27:34.860 --> 27:37.440
Be patient, Maria.
He's soon gonna find out

27:37.540 --> 27:41.440
that some Austrians are his friends,
whatever their motives.

27:41.540 --> 27:42.840
Keep working at it.

28:00.340 --> 28:02.360
Amalie Zuckerkandl.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.400
Also painted by Klimt.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.800
She was a friend of our family.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.640
She died in a death camp.

28:09.740 --> 28:11.344
Belzec, yes.

28:12.420 --> 28:15.600
Mrs. Altmann,
your aunt is around this corner.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.350
Are you ready for the reunion?

28:37.500 --> 28:41.400
Rightly or wrongly, she has become
embedded in Austria's identity.

28:41.500 --> 28:45.360
A national icon. Adele has become
part of the country's psyche.

28:45.460 --> 28:47.827
Aunt Adele.

29:03.820 --> 29:05.960
Do you like it?

29:06.060 --> 29:08.160
Why is it all gold?

29:08.260 --> 29:11.240
Ignore the gold. That's Klimt.

29:11.340 --> 29:14.503
Look at my face. Does it resemble me?

29:14.620 --> 29:18.625
Yes, but I don't think you look happy.

29:20.180 --> 29:23.880
I wonder what it will be like
to be a woman

29:23.980 --> 29:26.880
when you are older,

29:26.980 --> 29:29.984
whether you will have to amuse
yourself with trivialities.

29:36.220 --> 29:39.400
Portrait of Adele, painted by Klimt.

29:39.500 --> 29:45.143
One of our most famous paintings.
A wonderful example of Austria's heritage.

30:29.020 --> 30:31.466
Quickly, let's get home.

30:44.260 --> 30:48.231
The government has announced
that citizens

30:48.340 --> 30:52.280
may not leave the country
without authorization.

30:52.380 --> 30:55.543
These new regulations
will be enforced immediately.

30:56.540 --> 30:59.520
My brother was right.
We should have left already.

30:59.620 --> 31:00.600
Look.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.744
It's Mrs. Klein, the doctor's wife.

31:08.860 --> 31:11.704
What are they doing to her?

31:11.820 --> 31:14.903
Forcing her to clean
the pavement with acid.

31:16.900 --> 31:21.462
And Mr. Rosenblatt was made
to write "Jew" on his shop window.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.120
But why?

31:23.220 --> 31:25.188
Why do you think, Therese?

31:33.140 --> 31:34.880
Fetch my cello, Maria.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.120
What for, Father?

31:37.220 --> 31:39.240
It's nearly five.

31:39.340 --> 31:43.400
Why should this Saturday
be different from any other?

31:43.500 --> 31:45.160
Because it is.

31:45.260 --> 31:47.680
I will not allow them to touch us.

31:47.780 --> 31:50.280
- Father.
- The cello, Maria.

31:50.380 --> 31:51.666
Go.

32:25.220 --> 32:30.680
The passport office will close
at 2 p.m. until further notice.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.987
Denied. Next.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.960
My husband's brother is in England,
and my sister is in Switzerland.

32:39.060 --> 32:43.280
We have places to stay
in both countries.

32:43.380 --> 32:45.120
There are only four of us,

32:45.220 --> 32:47.268
but we need to leave Austria
as soon as possible.

32:48.980 --> 32:51.200
So do all the other Jews.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.268
What makes you so special?

32:55.580 --> 32:57.947
Denied. Next.

33:16.340 --> 33:18.502
Your business is finished. Paint.

33:25.180 --> 33:27.501
Jewish pigs. Serves you right.

33:35.260 --> 33:37.581
Don't look.

33:50.220 --> 33:53.463
Thank heavens. We were worried.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.109
Open the door!

34:15.179 --> 34:16.760
They're here.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.920
Of course they are.

34:19.020 --> 34:21.520
Fritz, open the door.

34:21.620 --> 34:22.621
Yes, sir.

34:36.580 --> 34:38.159
Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer?

34:38.260 --> 34:40.760
My brother is in Switzerland
on business.

34:40.860 --> 34:42.350
Is that what it's called?

34:47.380 --> 34:50.600
Your brother's sugar company
is guilty of tax evasion

34:50.699 --> 34:53.199
amounting to one million Reichsmark.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.000
His assets have been frozen
until the money is paid.

34:56.100 --> 34:58.320
This officer will be staying with you.

34:58.420 --> 35:01.943
- From now on, you are under house arrest.
- My uncle is a law-abiding citizen.

35:09.580 --> 35:12.265
You are a family
that appreciates the power of art.

35:21.060 --> 35:23.080
Holbein.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.840
Impressive.

35:24.940 --> 35:27.227
A silver cup with precious stones.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.428
A diamond necklace.

35:33.180 --> 35:35.680
Two silver candlesticks.

35:35.780 --> 35:37.111
A cello!

35:40.780 --> 35:42.305
Stradivarius.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.960
Of course, only the best.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.880
No, please.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.823
It is his joy.

35:54.460 --> 35:58.040
I could've searched for
the family file on my own, you know.

35:58.140 --> 36:00.320
I wasn't going to miss all the fun.

36:00.420 --> 36:04.000
This is like a James Bond film,
and you're Sean Connery.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.400
Yeah.

36:05.500 --> 36:06.840
Hello. I'm Anna.

36:06.940 --> 36:08.544
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello.

36:08.660 --> 36:12.320
- It's an honor to meet you.
- Thank you so much for doing this for us.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.320
So you know Hubertus?

36:14.420 --> 36:17.344
Everything from the museum
records prior to 1972

36:17.460 --> 36:18.905
is held in the same room.

36:23.220 --> 36:26.588
I think you're going to have a busy day.

36:30.340 --> 36:32.581
Roll up your sleeves, Randy.

36:59.220 --> 37:00.560
Congratulations.

37:00.660 --> 37:02.920
Quite a treasure trove of information.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.320
Hubertus and I were up all night
going over the file.

37:05.420 --> 37:07.680
Well, I'm glad to see you're
getting on so well together.

37:07.780 --> 37:09.111
So now we can start

37:09.220 --> 37:11.960
to actually put together a picture
of what really happened.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.560
Maria, you are the living link
to the past.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.320
Hanging on by my fingernails.

37:16.420 --> 37:18.440
Tell us what you know.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.680
Adele died in 1925.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.680
Meningitis. She was only 43.

37:22.780 --> 37:25.520
My Uncle Ferdinand was devastated.

37:25.620 --> 37:28.320
And then, of course, the will,
written in 1923,

37:28.420 --> 37:30.960
two years before she died.

37:31.060 --> 37:34.240
Her signature. Oh, my God.

37:34.340 --> 37:36.120
I'll translate as accurately as I can.

37:36.220 --> 37:38.480
"I kindly ask my husband

37:38.580 --> 37:39.960
"to bequeath my portrait

37:40.060 --> 37:42.301
"and the other Klimt paintings
after his death

37:42.420 --> 37:44.070
to the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna."

37:48.100 --> 37:49.800
So she did leave them to the gallery.

37:49.900 --> 37:53.160
Oh, Randy, have we come
all this way for nothing?

37:53.260 --> 37:55.024
One step at a time, Maria.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.480
She does, in fact,
request for the paintings to go

37:57.580 --> 38:00.760
to the Belvedere, but the request has
a very specific condition attached to it.

38:00.860 --> 38:02.320
She specifically asks the paintings

38:02.420 --> 38:05.000
go to the Belvedere
after Ferdinand's death.

38:05.100 --> 38:06.800
Let's tell the story chronologically.

38:06.900 --> 38:08.709
Maria, do you have any idea
of what happened

38:08.820 --> 38:10.800
to your family's property
after you got away?

38:10.900 --> 38:13.640
Not at all. Unlike Lot's wife,
I never looked back.

38:13.740 --> 38:15.230
Maybe now it's time to know.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.760
After you escaped Austria,
Maria, your home

38:18.860 --> 38:21.909
became the scene of
one of the great thefts of the time.

38:24.140 --> 38:25.720
Your family's belongings

38:25.820 --> 38:27.520
ended up in the hands
of the most powerful

38:27.620 --> 38:29.190
criminals of the Nazi elite.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.760
All of our things, our personal things?

38:31.860 --> 38:34.600
Did you know, for instance, that one
of your uncle's favorite paintings,

38:34.700 --> 38:36.080
a Waldmüller portrait
of Count Esterhazy...

38:36.180 --> 38:37.360
Yes, yes, I remember.

38:37.460 --> 38:38.800
It was hanging in the living room.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.800
I never liked it, actually.

38:40.900 --> 38:44.880
...ended up decorating the walls
of no less a place than the Berghof,

38:44.980 --> 38:48.160
Hitler's private residence
in the Bavarian Alps?

38:48.260 --> 38:49.705
Or that your aunt's necklace,

38:49.820 --> 38:51.880
the same one she wears
in the Klimt portrait,

38:51.980 --> 38:53.960
came to adorn the neck of Emmy Goering,

38:54.060 --> 38:56.040
Hermann Goering's wife?

38:56.140 --> 38:58.160
I don't think I want to hear this.

38:58.260 --> 39:00.000
The Nazis themselves
were not so keen on the Klimts.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.960
They were, after all,
a bit too degenerate for their taste.

39:02.060 --> 39:04.800
But the paintings
caught the eye of someone

39:04.900 --> 39:08.320
with a more prescient
and refined appreciation of art,

39:08.420 --> 39:11.185
- Bruno Grimshitz.
- Grimshitz?!

39:11.300 --> 39:13.280
The paintings were taken off
the walls of your family home

39:13.380 --> 39:15.760
and carefully transported
to the Belvedere.

39:15.860 --> 39:18.120
Certain facts had to be altered,

39:18.220 --> 39:21.000
like your aunt's name and her
Jewish provenance, of course.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.720
For a short while after the war,

39:22.820 --> 39:24.640
she became simply known as...

39:24.740 --> 39:26.480
"Woman in Gold."

39:26.580 --> 39:29.600
So her identity was stolen as well.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.760
It wasn't enough to rob your family
and try to destroy it.

39:32.860 --> 39:36.120
No. You had to be eradicated
from history.

39:36.220 --> 39:37.720
So the paintings reached the Belvedere.

39:37.820 --> 39:39.080
In 1941.

39:39.180 --> 39:40.600
Your uncle, Maria, died...

39:40.700 --> 39:43.120
At the end of the war, 1945.

39:43.220 --> 39:45.240
So, contrary to the request
in Adele's will,

39:45.340 --> 39:48.520
the paintings ended up in the Belvedere
well before his death.

39:48.620 --> 39:51.120
And if I'm not mistaken,
he wrote his own will before he died.

39:51.220 --> 39:52.440
Yes, he did.

39:52.540 --> 39:55.360
Leaving everything he owned,
or at least what was left of it,

39:55.460 --> 39:57.360
to you and your sister,
his only living heirs.

39:57.460 --> 40:00.160
It was one of the last things he did
before he died, a few days later.

40:00.260 --> 40:03.560
Yes, but won't they argue that Adele
did leave them to the gallery?

40:03.660 --> 40:05.720
So, really, we don't have a case.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.300
Randy, why don't you show
Maria our trump card?

40:09.380 --> 40:10.640
What's this?

40:10.740 --> 40:12.880
That is a declaration
that Ferdinand paid...

40:12.980 --> 40:14.240
- ...for the paintings.
- Mmm.

40:14.340 --> 40:17.040
He was the rightful owner, not Adele.

40:17.140 --> 40:20.269
The paintings weren't hers to give away.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.240
So the will is invalid?

40:23.340 --> 40:24.880
Technically, it's not a will.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.760
It's not legally binding.

40:26.860 --> 40:28.191
It's more like a wish.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.840
Now we need to get all this to Rudolf Wran,
the head of the restitution committee.

40:32.940 --> 40:35.080
Yes. And then your aunt
is coming home with us.

40:35.180 --> 40:36.320
Oh!

40:36.420 --> 40:37.581
Randy, wait and listen.

40:38.900 --> 40:42.120
She is the Mona Lisa of Austria.

40:42.220 --> 40:44.507
Do you think they will just let her go?

40:46.700 --> 40:48.040
See, w-we've left Mr. Wran

40:48.140 --> 40:49.720
four messages this morning alone.

40:49.820 --> 40:51.680
Mr. Wran is very busy right now.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.920
- You understand?
- Yes, of course we understand,

40:54.020 --> 40:56.080
but it is essential
that we speak with him.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.720
The problem is it's imperative
that we speak...

40:57.820 --> 40:59.360
- ...to him this morning.
- Randy, Randy, is that him?

40:59.460 --> 41:01.240
I-I think it's best if
you leave him a message.

41:01.340 --> 41:02.400
- Mr. Wran?
- Wran. Wran.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.040
Mr., Mr. Rudolf Wran?

41:04.140 --> 41:05.280
Hi. I'm Randy Schoenberg.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.640
This is my client, Mrs. Altmann.

41:06.740 --> 41:09.040
- How do you do?
- Of course. I'm so sorry...

41:09.140 --> 41:11.120
I haven't had a moment
to reply to your calls.

41:11.220 --> 41:13.000
- Well, that's, uh...
- Please don't apologize.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.920
You're a very important man, very busy.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.560
There's quite a bit of new information

41:16.660 --> 41:18.000
that the restitution committee
needs to be aware of

41:18.100 --> 41:20.240
before they come to any sort of decision
on the Bloch-Bauer case.

41:20.340 --> 41:22.120
Is there indeed?

41:22.220 --> 41:23.560
Yes, it's all in here.
I've made some observations

41:23.660 --> 41:25.560
in the margins. Excuse my handwriting.

41:25.660 --> 41:27.760
You've been busy
during your stay in Vienna.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.200
We didn't come here to eat cake.

41:31.540 --> 41:36.560
Mr. Schoenberg, I understand
you're the composer's grandson.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.840
Now, do you know what a fan
I am of his work?

41:39.940 --> 41:41.880
You're a man of refined taste, Mr. Wran.

41:41.980 --> 41:44.506
The genius of the 12-tone
compositional system

41:44.620 --> 41:45.960
should not be underestimated.

41:46.060 --> 41:49.640
Thank you for your efforts, but we
have all the information we need now.

41:49.740 --> 41:53.108
If you'll excuse me,
there's work to be done.

42:01.380 --> 42:02.960
It's hard to believe Hitler

42:03.060 --> 42:05.160
once applied to be an art student here.

42:05.260 --> 42:08.025
I wish they'd accepted him.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.280
They're all here.

42:14.380 --> 42:16.160
The woman just coming in the door...

42:16.260 --> 42:18.520
Elizabeth Gehrer, Minister of Culture.

42:18.620 --> 42:21.360
With your new friend, Rudolf Wran.

42:21.460 --> 42:22.920
Quite a turnout.

42:23.020 --> 42:25.387
They're putting on a very good show.

42:30.820 --> 42:32.840
Welcome to the Restitution Conference.

42:35.060 --> 42:38.680
This is a first step
in making reparation

42:38.780 --> 42:42.800
towards those whose art
was unlawfully taken from them.

42:42.900 --> 42:45.870
The mountain landscape
hung in the main room of our house.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.840
It was the first thing you saw
when you opened the front door.

42:49.940 --> 42:53.720
I will never forget the day
that they stormed in our house

42:53.820 --> 42:57.480
and took our paintings off the wall.

42:57.580 --> 43:03.360
Our maid went into my mother's wardrobe

43:03.460 --> 43:06.200
and took out the clothes,
and she said to her,

43:06.300 --> 43:09.280
"Don't think of going to the police,

43:09.380 --> 43:11.880
because they'll be here anyway."

43:11.980 --> 43:14.040
And so it was.

43:14.140 --> 43:16.200
Some police came,

43:16.300 --> 43:19.680
and other people,
and stripped the place.

43:19.780 --> 43:23.000
When people see
the famous portrait, they see

43:23.100 --> 43:27.280
a masterpiece by one
of Austria's finest artists.

43:27.380 --> 43:30.640
But I see a picture of my aunt,

43:30.740 --> 43:33.240
a woman who...
who talked to me about life

43:33.340 --> 43:35.547
while I brushed her hair in her bedroom.

43:37.100 --> 43:39.040
Restitution.

43:39.140 --> 43:41.080
You see, that's an interesting word.

43:41.180 --> 43:43.520
You know, I looked it up
in the dictionary.

43:43.620 --> 43:48.080
"Restitution: the return
of something to its original state."

43:48.180 --> 43:50.960
Now, that made me think.

43:51.060 --> 43:54.348
You see, I would love to return
to my original state.

43:54.460 --> 43:58.465
I would love to be a happy woman
living in this beautiful city.

43:59.940 --> 44:03.080
Like so many of my generation
who had to flee,

44:03.180 --> 44:07.265
I will never forgive them
for preventing me from living here.

44:08.380 --> 44:14.228
At the very least, we should be reunited
with what is rightfully ours.

44:17.580 --> 44:19.184
Thank you.

44:21.660 --> 44:24.400
Mrs. Altmann, Dr. Bernhard Kohler.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.000
I work at the Belvedere Gallery.

44:26.100 --> 44:28.240
And how can I help you, Dr. Kohler?

44:28.340 --> 44:31.720
If the decision of the committee is
in your favor, take the three landscapes,

44:31.820 --> 44:33.880
but we implore you, not the portraits.

44:33.980 --> 44:35.425
You have grown attached to them.

44:35.540 --> 44:37.800
We cannot imagine Austria without them.

44:37.900 --> 44:39.880
- I can.
- Well...

44:39.980 --> 44:42.080
once the past has been put to right,

44:42.180 --> 44:45.150
I would be open
to an arrangement with you.

44:45.260 --> 44:46.960
Maria, may I speak
with you for a moment?

44:47.060 --> 44:50.064
Will you excuse me? I think
my lawyer's getting a trifle nervous.

44:50.180 --> 44:52.660
Please feel free to call me,
so we can resume the conversation.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.240
I think we need to be careful
about what we say.

44:56.340 --> 44:59.400
Oh, you mean you think I should
be careful about what I say.

44:59.500 --> 45:01.080
A moment ago, you called me your lawyer.

45:01.180 --> 45:02.560
Most people take advice
from their lawyers.

45:02.660 --> 45:04.160
Yes, when they ask for it.

45:04.260 --> 45:08.504
Now, if you don't mind, I would like
to walk back to the hotel alone.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.840
Mrs. Altmann,
a powerful speech you gave.

45:15.940 --> 45:18.102
But why don't you let
the past be the past?

45:19.220 --> 45:23.225
You people never give up, do you?
Not everything is about the Holocaust.

46:04.580 --> 46:07.186
My brother has booked
the last two tickets to Cologne.

46:07.300 --> 46:08.840
And then what?

46:08.940 --> 46:12.480
From Cologne, we go to the border.

46:12.580 --> 46:14.680
There's a contact.

46:14.780 --> 46:17.040
He's been paid to smuggle us across.

46:17.140 --> 46:18.824
When is the flight to Cologne?

46:21.300 --> 46:22.825
Eight o'clock this evening.

46:25.420 --> 46:27.320
I can't leave my parents.

46:27.420 --> 46:29.627
It's our last chance, Maria.

46:31.420 --> 46:33.661
But someone has to
drive us to the airport.

46:34.940 --> 46:37.307
A friend of my father owes him a favor.

46:39.260 --> 46:41.960
He will never let us out of his sight.

46:42.060 --> 46:43.550
I have an idea.

46:45.260 --> 46:47.547
But first, I have
to say goodbye to them.

47:03.420 --> 47:05.080
Papa.

47:05.180 --> 47:06.320
Mutti.

47:06.420 --> 47:08.741
The time has come, hasn't it?

47:14.340 --> 47:16.240
You know as well as I do

47:16.340 --> 47:19.560
they won't let my father fetch a doctor

47:19.660 --> 47:21.947
because he has committed
the crime of being Jewish.

47:23.020 --> 47:25.751
So the least you can do
is let us go to the pharmacy.

47:26.820 --> 47:28.880
And why do you both need to go?

47:28.980 --> 47:33.040
For God's sake, if you're that worried
we're going to run away,

47:33.140 --> 47:34.665
why not come with us?

47:37.220 --> 47:38.520
Fine.

47:38.620 --> 47:40.702
I'll take you.

47:42.140 --> 47:44.600
But we come straight back.

47:44.700 --> 47:46.200
Shame.

47:46.300 --> 47:48.985
I was hoping we could
all go to the cinema.

48:21.820 --> 48:23.640
Don't be more than a minute.

48:23.740 --> 48:25.424
One minute, that's all.

48:30.900 --> 48:32.080
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

48:32.180 --> 48:33.880
What can I do for you?

48:33.980 --> 48:36.840
My father has a very high fever.

48:36.940 --> 48:39.040
We need something
to lower his temperature.

48:39.140 --> 48:40.266
One moment.

48:46.780 --> 48:48.908
Right, this should help.

48:58.220 --> 48:59.221
Keys!

49:01.140 --> 49:02.320
Fritz.

49:02.420 --> 49:03.751
Ja, ja, ja.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.741
What are you doing?

49:15.780 --> 49:18.240
I'm feeling faint. I need air.

49:18.340 --> 49:19.760
Please open the door.

49:19.860 --> 49:22.200
The soldier smoking on the street
is with you?

49:22.300 --> 49:23.320
Nein.

49:23.420 --> 49:26.000
No, please open the door, quickly.

49:26.100 --> 49:27.920
Of course, you are Jews.

49:28.020 --> 49:29.465
- Nein. Bitte.
- Hey!

49:32.820 --> 49:35.346
They're trying to get away! Quickly!

49:36.140 --> 49:37.380
Da.

49:40.740 --> 49:43.266
Halt! Halt!

49:49.540 --> 49:50.666
That way.

50:11.220 --> 50:13.120
Are you sure this heads
to the Town Hall?

50:13.220 --> 50:14.426
Yes.

50:26.820 --> 50:28.504
Go! I'll meet you there!

50:49.700 --> 50:51.668
Jewish scum.

51:16.540 --> 51:18.190
They went in there.

51:23.300 --> 51:25.189
The car.

51:32.820 --> 51:33.946
Catch them.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.440
Thank you.

52:19.540 --> 52:22.191
I'd do anything for your family.
Good luck.

52:22.460 --> 52:23.461
Danke.

52:42.140 --> 52:43.600
- Danke.
- Bitte.

52:43.700 --> 52:44.861
Your tickets, please.

52:49.700 --> 52:50.840
Traveling to Cologne?

52:50.940 --> 52:52.669
Cologne, yes.

52:54.700 --> 52:55.906
You have no luggage?

52:57.900 --> 53:00.080
It's all very unexpected.

53:00.180 --> 53:02.360
We are going for one night.

53:02.460 --> 53:06.181
My husband is understudying
Wotan at the Cologne Opera.

53:06.300 --> 53:08.200
Their baritone has fallen ill.

53:08.300 --> 53:11.827
Van Karajan is conducting.
We're very excited.

53:17.380 --> 53:18.520
Good luck.

53:18.620 --> 53:19.860
Thank you.

53:19.980 --> 53:20.981
Next.

53:23.860 --> 53:27.200
Announcement for passengers
of Flight 12, destination Cologne.

53:27.300 --> 53:33.040
Due to unforeseen circumstances,
your departure has been delayed.

53:33.140 --> 53:35.920
Our apologies for
any inconvenience caused.

53:48.580 --> 53:52.520
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're ready to start boarding.

53:52.620 --> 53:55.703
Please have your tickets ready
for inspection.

54:01.900 --> 54:02.901
Achtung!

54:04.620 --> 54:06.827
There are passengers who will not
be boarding this flight tonight.

54:09.540 --> 54:12.749
Herr Stephan Neumann
und Herr Karl Neumann.

54:15.340 --> 54:17.229
Make yourselves known!

54:22.940 --> 54:24.465
Please approach.

54:34.460 --> 54:35.791
Ladies and gentlemen.

55:16.260 --> 55:17.720
And this is Minister Gehrer.

55:17.820 --> 55:19.200
How do you do?

55:19.300 --> 55:23.960
Dr. Dreimann here is our principal
attorney on this very complicated case.

55:24.060 --> 55:25.186
Please sit.

55:29.460 --> 55:34.240
Some cases are more complicated
than others, but...

55:34.340 --> 55:36.680
after much deliberation,

55:36.780 --> 55:39.080
we regret to inform you, Frau Altmann,

55:39.180 --> 55:43.280
that the committee has decided
that the five Klimt paintings

55:43.380 --> 55:46.748
hanging in the Belvedere
will remain there.

55:48.380 --> 55:50.348
Please tell me this is a joke.

55:51.580 --> 55:53.400
They're not joking, Randy.

55:53.500 --> 55:54.640
Your aunt's will should be obeyed.

55:54.740 --> 55:57.823
But that's the point.
It isn't even a will.

55:59.300 --> 56:02.280
Uh, the-the paintings
aren't hers to give away. Here.

56:02.380 --> 56:04.400
Uh, where is it?

56:04.500 --> 56:07.240
We have proof that the paintings
were Ferdinand's property,

56:07.340 --> 56:09.000
not his wife's, which
makes her will invalid.

56:09.100 --> 56:10.880
I think this is the one
you're looking for.

56:10.980 --> 56:12.600
And that's ignor...
And that's ignoring the fact

56:12.700 --> 56:14.360
that there was a deliberate
cover-up to conceal the manner

56:14.460 --> 56:16.480
in which the paintings
ended up in the gallery.

56:16.580 --> 56:18.360
They're not interested
in the facts, Randy.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.040
Your aunt's request
needs to be respected.

56:20.140 --> 56:22.461
It's not a legally binding will.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.800
Do you imagine my aunt
would have written those words

56:24.900 --> 56:26.680
if she knew what was to come?

56:26.780 --> 56:28.080
Do you?

56:28.180 --> 56:31.920
The looting of her home,
the murder of her people.

56:32.020 --> 56:33.920
Our decision is nonnegotiable.

56:34.020 --> 56:37.229
If you don't agree with it, your only
option is to pursue the case in court.

56:38.300 --> 56:39.540
Come on, Randy, let's go.

56:42.460 --> 56:46.240
Dr. Dreimann, you speak as if
you knew my aunt,

56:46.340 --> 56:48.040
but you did not know her,

56:48.140 --> 56:51.480
and I can tell you right now,
that what you have decided today

56:51.580 --> 56:55.585
would make her ashamed
to call herself an Austrian.

56:57.580 --> 57:00.026
And you should be ashamed, too.

57:05.260 --> 57:06.600
It's not America.

57:06.700 --> 57:08.350
In order to pursue the case in Austria,

57:08.460 --> 57:10.269
the government demands
a deposit against the cost

57:10.380 --> 57:13.270
of $1.8 million,
and that's for starters.

57:13.380 --> 57:14.880
$1.8 million?!

57:14.980 --> 57:17.600
Based on a portion of the estimated
value of the paintings.

57:17.700 --> 57:20.560
Okay, so on one hand, they're...
they're saying, "Take us to court."

57:20.660 --> 57:23.560
On the other hand, it's
financially impossible for us to do that.

57:23.660 --> 57:25.280
Your hands are tied
behind your back, yes.

57:25.380 --> 57:27.240
What-what about arbitration...
here in Vienna?

57:27.340 --> 57:31.040
Nobody will decide to give you back
the paintings, Randy... nobody.

57:31.140 --> 57:34.000
It's a total waste of time and money.

57:34.100 --> 57:36.148
No more daydreaming.

57:36.900 --> 57:39.400
Thank you, Hubertus,
for all your effort.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.840
Come on, Randy.

57:41.940 --> 57:43.510
It's time to go pack.

57:43.620 --> 57:45.588
- Hubertus.
- I'm sorry.

58:04.260 --> 58:07.628
- Just checking on you.
- Come in. Sit down.

58:08.900 --> 58:10.823
How you doing?

58:10.940 --> 58:12.829
I'm exhausted.

58:12.940 --> 58:15.560
That's what happens when
you have to deal all day

58:15.660 --> 58:17.240
with a lot of grim shits.

58:19.820 --> 58:21.880
They'll never admit to what they did,

58:21.980 --> 58:24.880
because if they admit to one thing,
they have to admit to it all.

58:24.980 --> 58:26.280
Admit to what?

58:26.380 --> 58:28.560
They were never victims.

58:28.660 --> 58:32.760
Most of them threw flowers
and welcomed the Nazis with open arms,

58:32.860 --> 58:34.669
and that's the simple truth.

58:38.300 --> 58:41.320
It's with great pleasure that I announce

58:41.420 --> 58:45.640
that Klimt's "Adele"
will be remaining in Austria.

58:45.740 --> 58:47.600
This is a victory
for the Belvedere Gallery

58:47.700 --> 58:49.240
and a victory for the Austrian people.

58:49.340 --> 58:52.221
- Oh, enough. Switch it off.
- Thank you.

58:54.020 --> 58:55.880
Tomorrow we will go home,

58:55.980 --> 58:58.200
and on the way to the airport,

58:58.300 --> 59:00.200
we will stop to pay our respects

59:00.300 --> 59:02.680
at the Holocaust Memorial.

59:02.780 --> 59:05.465
That way, we will not
have come here in vain.

59:18.940 --> 59:22.560
The camp where my great-grandparents
were murdered.

59:22.660 --> 59:24.424
Treblinka.

59:25.500 --> 59:29.360
They died soon after your grandfather
escaped to America.

59:29.460 --> 59:30.440
I remember them well.

59:30.540 --> 59:32.720
They had a cherry blossom tree
in the garden,

59:32.820 --> 59:35.471
and she had the most beautiful eyes.

59:36.540 --> 59:39.111
Your mother reminds me of her.

59:41.260 --> 59:44.901
Then they were taken away
in the middle of the night.

59:49.500 --> 59:50.840
Randy...

59:50.940 --> 59:53.680
we must go to the airport now.

59:53.780 --> 59:56.306
Okay.

59:56.420 --> 59:58.680
Know what? Um...

59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.360
I'm... I'm gonna use the men's room.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.066
- I'll be right back.
- Yes.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.640
My grandfather used to say
the three things that

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.040
he hated most in life were
Hitler, his grandmother,

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.640
and the Los Angeles sun,
but I got to say,

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.200
everything about Los Angeles
feels pretty damn great right now.

01:00:49.703 --> 01:00:51.880
You know if my darling Fritz
was still alive,

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.080
he would welcome us home with an aria.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.440
Welcome home.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.400
- To Randy and Maria.
- Randy and Maria.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.200
I'm not drinking today.
Thank you, anyway.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:06.160
We did our best...
and that's what matters.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.264
We did everything we could.

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.760
The past is the past,

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.783
and now we must let it go.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.106
Maria?

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.124
Randy.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.105
Hey.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:30.461
I went for the money.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.560
Those paintings are worth
over $100 million.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:39.720
That's why I went out there with her.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.663
I went for the money, Pam.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.422
It's natural.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.625
But you're home now, and it's okay.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.908
Is it?

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.345
Randy?

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.382
That's $29, sir.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.025
- Thank you, Mrs. Scheff.
- Good-bye.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.200
- Oh.
- Oh. Excuse me.

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.160
Thank you.

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.480
Fancy seeing you again,
after all this time.

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:12.960
Belvedere catalog, on sale
in Barnes & Noble on Wilshire.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.400
And hello to you, too.
What are you babbling about?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.800
You don't understand. We got 'em.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.952
You can sue them here, in the U.S.

01:03:21.052 --> 01:03:23.354
Not all that again.

01:03:23.454 --> 01:03:25.404
Oh, anyway, Randy, I thought you said

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.560
we couldn't sue them here
because of that...

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:30.231
the foreign state immunity thing.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.880
I did, but I found a loophole.
Three conditions.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.640
Which are?

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.280
When the property's taken
in violation of international law.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.120
- Which it was.
- Thank you.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.880
And that property is owned
by an agency of a foreign state.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.640
You mean the Belvedere Gallery?

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:46.600
Thank you. And that agency engages
in a commercial activity within the USA.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.960
Selling books in Barnes & Noble?

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:53.440
Thank you. If you meet these criteria,
you can sue them here in the U.S.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.584
Congratulations... you meet 'em.
You can sue.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.101
Yes, but I don't want to.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.560
Oh, don't you remember
what I told you, Randy?

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.240
Sometimes it's...

01:04:06.395 --> 01:04:08.803
You just have to move on.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.560
It's a long shot.

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.400
For starters, there's no precedent.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.560
There is. There's one case
that I found, sir.

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.920
It's a Jewish family
from Argentina, they lost a hotel.

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:23.000
The answer is no.

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.864
I have a real feeling about this, sir.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.382
Since when have we been
paying you to have feelings?

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:57.000
It's commonly known
as an ultimatum, Randy.

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.101
I humored you.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:01.880
"Let him go to Europe," I thought,
"let him flex his muscles."

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.080
God knows, I suppose there was
a small part of me that hoped...

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.960
- ...you were onto something.
- I think I am.

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.640
You're not. There isn't a case.

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.920
There's no enforcement mechanism
between the U.S. and Austria.

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:14.760
- Just one more go, sir.
- I need you here now.

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.480
No more extracurricular stuff,

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.390
and no more Klimts.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.800
Hi there.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.268
Hi. I'm here to file a lawsuit
against the Austrian government.

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.480
I've filled in the summons
and that's the complaint.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.040
- What do I owe you?
- Well, that'll cost you $165.

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.640
I want to go to Austria one day,
with my daughter.

01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:43.631
She loves kangaroos.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.640
Maria?

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.520
Hey, can you come with me for a second?

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.080
I'd like you to witness something.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.750
Come on, come on, come on,
come on... double time.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.840
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.120
Is Consul Brandstetter around?

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.360
- I'm afraid not, sir.
- Oh, well, tell him...

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.520
that Mrs. Altmann
and Randy Schoenberg dropped by.

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:01.760
- I think he may have heard of us.
- Okay.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.360
What do we want with
the Austrian Consul?

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:07.200
Please inform him that I'm dropping off
a summons and complaint... here it is.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.560
We're taking the Austrian
government to court.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.640
Have a nice day.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.960
- Mm.
- Okay.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.760
Randy...

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.320
Will you slow down a little, please,
and tell me what's going on?

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.000
We're taking them to court.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.800
No, you can't do this. You can't just go

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.960
charging ahead like a...
like a mad steamroller.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.600
- Can't I?
- Randy, stop walking so fast.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.840
I can't keep up with you. Stop!

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.840
Now...

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.783
I told you before I have no interest
in suing them.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.800
I have had enough excitement.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.440
I... I have returned to my quiet life

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.000
and finally begun to find
some peace again.

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.590
Say that again with conviction.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.120
Don't be impertinent.

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.760
Oh, you do annoy me.

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.640
Anyway, you don't have
the time for this.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:53.062
You... you have a family to support,
and you have a full-time job.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.960
Oh, no.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.680
What do you mean, you quit?

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.781
I quit my job.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:05.600
Hey, I talked to my father...
he can give us a loan, you know,

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:08.240
- Oh, great. Great.
- ...to keep us afloat for a few months.

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.840
Just when we're expecting another baby.

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.863
Don't you think
we're under pressure enough?

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:14.920
We're supposed to make
these decisions together.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.080
- Isn't that the point?
- Yeah.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.800
I'm sorry.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.345
You're right.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.200
It's Austria.

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.200
Something happened out there,
and I don't know...

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.302
I don't know why, but I can't let it go.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.640
I think it's important.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.150
I'm so sorry.

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.000
Let's hope we're not wasting
our time today.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.070
You realize this is only
the first stage, right?

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.560
They've hired Stan Gould
of Heimann Rose,

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.600
which is a hotshot Jewish law firm.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.000
Mm. Nice of them
to give jobs to Jewish boys.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.120
They're trying to dismiss
the case on procedural grounds,

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.747
which is just a fancy way of saying
we're trying to drag it out.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:02.000
In the hopes that I'll die
before the case comes to court.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.400
Precisely.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.200
Well, I will do them
the favor of staying alive.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:08.120
Oh, Randy, can't you
drive a little faster?

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.222
Look, the chocolate
on your donut is melting.

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.786
Right here.

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:16.080
Mr. Gould. Hi.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.399
- Mr. Schoenberg.
- An absolute pleasure, sir.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.680
Mrs. Altmann.

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:20.680
Dr. Dreimann, nice of you
to come from Austria.

01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:21.960
That's very flattering.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.640
I've always wanted to visit Disneyland.

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.720
Two birds with one stone, as they say.

01:08:25.819 --> 01:08:27.960
I hope we make your visit worthwhile.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.984
Mrs. Altmann, may I say you're looking
even younger than you did in Vienna.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.160
You know, this morning,
I feel as if I have

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.160
another 50 years in front of me.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:37.149
All rise.

01:08:42.779 --> 01:08:46.040
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
- You have chocolate...

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.880
Let us begin.

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:49.760
- Mr. Gould?
- Your Honor...

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:53.800
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act was passed in 1976,

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:57.040
a good 38 years
after the events in question.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.399
It seems to me obvious
that the FSIA rulings

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.120
cannot be retroactively applied,
and I'm bewildered

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.960
that Mrs. Altmann's counsel
has not advised her of this fact.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.840
It would have saved her
a great deal of inconvenience

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:11.080
and an equal amount of false hope.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.640
No, not really... it is not
an inconvenience for me.

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.359
Mondays is a quiet day in my shop...

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.200
- ...anyway, so...
- I'm glad to hear it...

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.120
Mrs. Altmann,
but from now on would you mind

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.359
only speaking when you're asked?

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:23.191
There are certain procedures which
must be adhered to in a courtroom.

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:28.960
Your Honor, Mr. Gould
is right, um, to point out

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.080
that the FSIA was enacted in 1976,

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:34.760
but he's mistaken in his theory
that it cannot be applied retroactively.

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:36.828
Um, i-if... if I may?

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.760
Despite the fact that actions

01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:42.439
accruing before 1976 are rarer,
they very much exist.

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.640
These are just three examples of them.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.319
Thank you very much,
Mr. Schoenberg... I'm sure this

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.000
will prove to be a riveting read.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.640
Let's adjourn for ten minutes.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.800
This is a domestic matter for Austria.

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:56.000
Anything else would be a violation
of its national sovereignty.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.000
After all, there is a forum
for Mrs. Altmann

01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.440
to pursue her case in Austria...

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.360
without resorting to American courts

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.400
and American taxpayers' money.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.120
I applaud Mr. Gould's concern
for the American taxpayer,

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.160
but taking the defendant
to court in Austria

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:11.360
would require that Mrs. Altmann
be a multimillionairess.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.200
It's not an option.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.360
As a matter of fact,
we've exhausted all other options.

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:19.350
If we hadn't, we wouldn't be
standing before you today.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.680
The plaintiff has adequately proven

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:26.560
that the FSIA can apply
to pre-1976 events.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.240
Also, due to prohibitive costs,

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.240
this court has decided
that Austria provides

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:33.071
an inadequate forum
for resolution of plaintiffs claim.

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.581
- Your Honor...
- Defendant's motion to dismiss is denied.

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.671
All rise.

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.440
First hurdle down.

01:10:44.052 --> 01:10:47.069
You know, I've always thought
there should be more women judges.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.630
This is a setback, absolutely...

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.080
Dr. Dreimann.

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.511
Congratulations, Mr. Schoenberg.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.040
An unexpected outcome,
which, no doubt...

01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.960
- ...has delighted you.
- You're a very busy man.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.920
I would urge you to consider mediation.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.720
There will be no mediation,
Mr. Schoenberg.

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.840
You've been exceptionally lucky today,
but make no mistake, we'll take this

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.720
to the Supreme Court, if we have to.

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.504
Good day to you.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:16.422
Enjoy Disneyland.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.040
Mrs. Altmann, I'm Ronald Lauder.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.760
The son of Estée.

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.400
Her lipsticks are marvelous.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.360
Stay Mocha... my favorite.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.280
Please, sit.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.680
I have so much respect
for your campaign.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:49.264
The artworks stolen by the Nazis
are the last prisoners of World War ll,

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.320
and Adele is their queen.

01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.000
My aunt would be very flattered.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.600
I was a young man
when I first saw the portrait,

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.240
and I instantly fell in love.

01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:59.560
- Oh...
- Which is why...

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.720
I want it for my gallery in New York.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.560
We're jumping the gun
a little here, Mr. Lauder.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.320
Well, one needs to do what one can

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.400
to make a favorable outcome
as likely as possible.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.600
Which brings me to young Mr. Schoenberg.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.400
Now, he's been a formidable ally...

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.920
And continues to be one.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.680
Well, he's very smart, but I'm afraid

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:19.511
he's not cut out for
the Supreme Court, Mrs. Altmann.

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.640
Getting you through
the complex appeal process

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.600
is one thing, but Washington?

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.640
It'd be a little like sending
a schoolboy onto the front line.

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.200
You think so?

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:31.480
I'm willing to pay for you to have the
finest representation from this point on.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.920
The man I have in mind
is to art restitution

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.720
what... Einstein is to relativity.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.027
He's done his homework on your case.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:42.360
Let's say he knows his stuff.
Can I ask him to call you?

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.747
You can ask him to take a hike.

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.880
I'm sticking with my schoolboy,
Mr. Lauder.

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.220
That's final.

01:12:51.654 --> 01:12:53.700
The repeated attem-attempts

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:57.000
to have this case dismissed by the...
by the defense has been nothing...

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.720
Honey, we need to take Dora to
your mother's and then go to the hospital.

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:02.360
- Should I go deeper with the voice?
- Sweetie, my water broke.

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.025
- Deeper with the voice... What?
- My water just broke.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:08.240
Okay, just stay calm, just stay calm.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.640
- Are you okay?
- Honey, I'm fine.

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.080
- You're having a baby right now.
- I'm aware of that.

01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:14.520
Okay, I think you should wear this tie
and this shirt to the Supreme Court.

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.680
This is the one your dad got you.

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:18.520
You need to take me to the hospital,
then you need to go

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.320
to Washington; you need to do this

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.280
- for all of us.
- Hold on, hold on.

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.280
- Are you sure about that?
- Listen...

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.360
whatever I said, I want you
to know I am with you now,

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.160
and even if it doesn't work out,
we will manage.

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.280
Either way, we're gonna be okay.

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.640
Yeah.

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.708
You're doing the right thing.

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.920
Have a cough drop.

01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:59.800
They're cherry flavored.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.380
I'll leave it here for later.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.320
My dear...

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.440
even if we go no further,

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:12.306
we made it all the way
to the Supreme Court.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.984
And that's quite a long way
for an Austrian girl like me.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.200
Can you please show me
the way to the washroom, sir?

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.360
Good, now say it again,

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.120
but with an American accent.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.440
If you say it like this,
then nobody will understand you.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.760
You can talk.
You sound like a silly Frankfurter.

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.360
I am a man, not a sausage.

01:14:46.078 --> 01:14:50.080
Maria Altmann!
Which one of you is Maria Altmann?

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.560
- I am.
- Ah.

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:53.708
Telegram for you.

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.424
It's from my sister.

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:20.908
She's waiting for us in California.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.226
But she's had news from Vienna.

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.871
Your father?

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:40.760
We'll hear arguments next in 0313.

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:44.840
The Republic of Austria
versus Maria Altmann.

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.510
Mr. Gould.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.960
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court,

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.160
I'll keep my arguments succinct, sir.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.640
This is a domestic matter for Austria.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.040
It has no place in the American courts.

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.640
Thank you, Mr. Gould.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:01.904
Mr. Franks, representing
the United States government.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.880
Your opening statement, please.

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:08.560
Mr. Chief Justice,

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:11.400
if this law were to be
applied retroactively,

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.680
it could open claims brought against
a number of foreign states,

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.160
which would further complicate
our international relations.

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:21.040
Give me an example.

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.840
Currently, there are cases pending against
countries such as Japan and France.

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.760
So what you're saying is Mrs. Altmann

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.720
shouldn't try to reclaim her paintings

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.471
because it would affect
our relations with Japan?

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.800
That could be
a possible outcome, Your Honor.

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.680
Mrs. Altmann,

01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.840
it would seem that
if your case goes forward,

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:42.228
world diplomacy will collapse,

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.200
and you will be solely responsible.

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.350
Mr. Schoenberg.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.320
Mr. Chief Justice,

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.388
and may it please the court...

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:05.800
we believe applying the FSIA
is not impermissibly retroactive.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.960
Why isn't it just as easy to say

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.600
that it does act retroactively?

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.160
Hmm? Because the question is,

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.760
"When should it exercise jurisdiction

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.510
for a particular purpose?"

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:32.030
I'm sorry, uh, I'm not sure
I understand the question.

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.630
I'm not sure I did, either.

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.101
Does anyone?

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.320
We're very sensitive

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.800
to the government's concerns,
Mr. Chief Justice,

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.920
uh, in the can of worms argument.

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.280
But each country is different
and poses different conditions,

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.120
unlike, say, Cuba, in Austria's case,

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.760
there's a treaty, so there's
no dispute as to what type

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.760
of law could apply.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.840
We recommend opening the can

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:03.400
and extracting just the one little worm

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.480
with a pair of tweezers,
and then quickly closing it shut again.

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.320
The defendants in this case

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.240
have continuously tried
to frustrate our attempts,

01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:13.400
raising every possible objection,

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.560
threatening an Armageddon
in international relations,

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:17.583
but let's put things
into perspective here.

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:23.302
This is a case of one woman
wanting back what is rightfully hers.

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:26.663
Mrs. Altmann came to America

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:29.560
as a young woman in search of peace.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:31.742
Let's give her justice, too.

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.143
Thank you, Mr. Schoenberg.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.720
Mrs. Altmann, were you surprised
that the U.S. government

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.640
supported the Austrians
in trying to get the case dismissed?

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.880
Certain people would like me
to hurry up and die.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.680
Why not the Americans, too?

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.160
David Pike, court reporter.

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:01.160
You were impressive in there, no doubt.

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.480
Oh, thank you. R-R-Randy Schoenberg.

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.600
Takes about three months
for the verdict to come through,

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.080
but there's no way you're gonna win.

01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.840
- Okay.
- I've been doing this job for 34 years.

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.400
I'm always right;
it's in their body language.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.120
Well, thank you... that's a
cheerful way to end the day.

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.400
- No problem.
- Okay.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.720
- All right, take care.
- Good luck.

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.390
Okay.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.062
Hi, Nathan.

01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.640
He waved at you.

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.670
Oh.

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.020
Hi, buddy.

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:53.800
Honey, can you stop looking
at your watch every two minutes?

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.462
Hello?

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.066
Okay.

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.560
Yeah.

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:08.840
You can't give up just yet.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.880
The fight goes on.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.840
The Supreme Court ruled in our favor.
We can take the Austrians to court.

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:17.440
Thank you.

01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:21.040
From the first moment I saw you,
I knew you were the right man for the job.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:24.223
That's why I ignored
all the terrible bits.

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.707
I thought this was
the outcome you wanted.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.669
Sure, we could take them to court.

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:36.545
They'll find other ways
to stretch it out, you know.

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:38.800
This could take a few more years.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:42.720
She may not live long enough to see
the outcome, and we can't afford it.

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:46.280
Honey, we've come so far.
We can't stop now.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.542
There is one more thing we could try.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.120
As a gesture of reconciliation,

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:56.145
I am willing to allow the paintings
to remain in the Belvedere.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.680
All you have to do is to admit
that you took them illegally.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.200
Yes, and then, of course,
come to some agreement

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.871
on the question of compensation.

01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:09.920
I'm afraid we are not budging,
and that is final.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:13.240
Can you help me understand the inflexible
position that you're taking?

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:16.400
We will not be paying for
something we believe is ours,

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.391
and we will fight you till the end
before we concede on this.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.749
Arbitration in Vienna.

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.231
- Randy?
- We choose...

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:35.640
one of the arbitrators, you choose
the other, the third is neutral.

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.520
Now you're talking sense.

01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.640
This sounds like a reasonable idea.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.080
Randy, may I speak with you
in private, please?

01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.261
Excuse us.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.240
First you make me agree

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.400
to a mediation, and now this.

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.080
Are you crazy enough to think
that some arbitration in Vienna

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.360
is going to vote in our favor?

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.320
I honestly don't think
that we have a choice.

01:21:57.522 --> 01:21:59.400
That means we have to go back to Austria.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.360
Maria...

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:02.800
listen to me.

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.320
I can't sit here
and argue with you, okay?

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.000
I'm doing what I think is best.

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:09.800
Now, you just need to be quiet
for once, and trust me.

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:12.028
No, Randy, I will not be quiet.

01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.225
No.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.830
Enough is enough.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.306
Congratulations, Dr. Dreimann.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.520
Your tactics have succeeded.

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:27.464
I'm not playing this game anymore.

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.320
Good-bye, gentlemen.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.720
Good-bye, Mrs. Altmann.

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:34.868
Maria...

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.462
Nice one, Maria, real nice.

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.880
I don't want to talk to you.

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:50.745
Well, the feeling is mutual,
but we don't have a choice.

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.520
It's over. No.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.920
We made a mistake.

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.920
What's over? What are you saying?

01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:00.240
I'm saying we should accept defeat.

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.720
And go back to what's left of our lives.

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:03.960
Are you insane?

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.400
I'm saying I'm tired
and they can keep the paintings!

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.640
What I'm saying, Randy,
is that, as of this moment,

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.469
I no longer require your services.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.064
Are you kidding me?

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.840
I've given everything that I have.
I am in so much debt.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.240
My wife and I, my-my children,

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.580
everything I fucking care about
in this world,

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:23.920
and you have the nerve to...

01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.600
Everything that I've done, I've done

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.680
to get those goddamn paintings
back for you.

01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.760
I wish you'd never asked me.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:33.680
And you-you have the nerve to come here
and say to me that it's over?

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:39.342
We're so close, you...

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.623
Just hang in there.

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.745
The Austrians will never let go.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.861
Never.

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.983
But I won't let them humiliate me again.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:15.620
Go back to Vienna if you have to,
but this time, I'm not coming with you.

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.868
You are on your own, Randy.

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.320
Arbitration may be affordable,

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.200
but it's also a risk.

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:44.800
The man we chose
for the arbitration panel

01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:48.000
is a safe bet, but I'm a bit worried
about the other two; I can't lie.

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:51.240
The one chosen by the Austrian State
is a strict traditionalist.

01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.160
I can't see her deciding in your favor.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.280
And as for the third...

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.080
well, it's a gamble.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.920
Here's hoping.

01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.800
I never thought you would
come back, and personally,

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.320
I need to be honest,
I don't think it's the right decision.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:05.422
You are betting on
Austria having changed.

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:12.880
- Hi.
- N'abend.

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.400
It starts in two minutes.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.240
Yeah, two tickets, please.

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.600
You have the same name as the composer.

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.384
What a coincidence.

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.840
The Austrian government has provided

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:10.546
its case in writing for our perusal.

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.600
Mr. Schoenberg, you, too,
were offered the opportunity

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.760
to do so, but you have opted

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:18.800
to present the introductory points

01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.560
of your argument orally, as well.

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:23.120
The floor is yours.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.346
Thank you, sir.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.560
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:35.840
I'm pleased to be standing
before you today for two reasons.

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.080
Firstly, like my opponents in this case,

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.960
I've always believed it was
a domestic issue for Austria,

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:44.267
which should be settled...

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.506
with-within her borders.

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:55.960
The first time, I came for myself.

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.062
This time, I came for him.

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:04.520
And the second reason that I'm happy,

01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.520
happy to be in Vienna,

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:08.680
was because my client,

01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:12.600
Mrs. Altmann, and I, are both Austrians.

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.800
But don't get me wrong,
we're very much Americans, too,

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.360
but... our families,
and the roots we share,

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:21.430
are situated in the culture
of this very city.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.640
And somewhere in the heart of this world

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.240
stands a woman whose portrait

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.520
both sides are fighting for:

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.349
Adele Bloch-Bauer.

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:34.760
During my visits
to this country, I've discerned

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:37.280
that there are two Austrias,
one which opposes restitution

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:38.840
to the victims of Nazism,

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:42.160
but also another,
which recognizes the injustices

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:43.920
committed against
Austria's Jewish population

01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:47.600
and, against all odds,
seeks to rectify it.

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.560
As I hope I've demonstrated
in my written arguments,

01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:52.320
the law favors restitution.

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.680
A string of events and misdeeds

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:56.920
point to the incontestable fact

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.520
that the paintings in question
reached the Belvedere

01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:01.120
and remained there
for over half a century,

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.920
in a manner that was both dishonest
and illegal,

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.120
and that Adele's will itself
was not legally binding.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:11.440
So in its own way, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a moment in history,

01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:16.040
a moment in which the past
is asking something of the present.

01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:19.560
Many years ago, just outside these walls,
terrible things happened.

01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:22.560
People dehumanized other people,

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.120
persecuted them,

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.800
sent many of them to their deaths,

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.640
decimating entire families.

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.520
And they stole from them.

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:32.840
Properties, livelihoods,

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.420
objects most precious to them.

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:40.160
And amongst those people
were the Bloch-Bauers,

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:43.025
the family of a very dear
friend of mine.

01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.320
So now I'm asking you, as Austrians,

01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:49.200
as human beings,

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.440
to recognize that wrong.

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:54.320
Not just for Maria Altmann,

01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.343
but for Austria.

01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:02.760
Would you look at that.

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:04.640
When I was a child,

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.640
my father used to bring me here
on Sundays.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:09.584
Yes, me, too, for waffles
and ice cream, yes.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:13.680
My father was an impressive man.

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:16.800
When I was a small boy,
I looked up to him.

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:18.680
Worshiped him.

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:21.545
And you wanted to grow up
to be like him.

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:27.504
When I was 15, I discovered
that he had been a Nazi, Maria.

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:31.342
A passionate follower
of the Third Reich.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.800
All my life, I've been trying
to make up for the sins of the father.

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.551
Every day, asking myself

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.920
how he could become the person he was.

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:44.671
And every day, trying
to move away from him.

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.800
You are a fine man, Hubertus.

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.470
A good man.

01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:58.560
Is that it?

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:00.480
Yeah.

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.880
Come on.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.902
My heart is beating.

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:24.760
We the arbitrators have now studied
both sides of this complex case.

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.720
Trying to keep an open mind

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:30.160
as we examine the evidence,

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.740
we have reached our final verdict.

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:39.520
Our decision today is that the portrait
of Adele Bloch-Bauer

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:42.590
and the other Klimt paintings
in question...

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.440
should be returned to her niece...

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.863
Maria Altmann.

01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:17.320
For the first time in a long while,

01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:19.400
I'm proud to call myself an Austrian.

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:20.960
Oh, you should be.

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.760
It's almost press time. How do I look?

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.320
Sexy and victorious.

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.680
- Oh, yeah?
- How do I look?

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:28.440
You look sexy and victorious.

01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:32.240
Mrs. Altmann, may I have a word?

01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:33.705
Yes, of course.

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.280
I'm defeated...

01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:42.589
but I will ask you, beg you,

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:45.640
entreat you...

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:48.320
not to let these paintings
leave their motherland.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:50.560
Let us come to an arrangement.

01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:52.867
I'm sure we can make a generous offer.

01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:59.186
I, too, am sad that they will
not stay in Adele's country.

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:03.240
But all along,
I have tried to negotiate,

01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:04.960
I have tried to keep the dialogue open,

01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.760
and all along, you have thwarted me

01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:08.862
and closed the doors in my face.

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.400
So, now...

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.280
I am tired...

01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:16.920
and my aunt will cross the Atlantic

01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:20.945
to make her home in America,
as I once had to.

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.783
Good-bye, Mrs. Altmann.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:33.071
I think our friend might be
needing a little attention.

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.141
Yeah.

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:39.160
Have I mentioned we couldn't
have done it without you?

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:40.705
No.

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.461
Maria?

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:06.382
In a moment, Randy.

01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.471
You all right?

01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:14.560
Thank you, my darling.

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:17.160
Thank you from the bottom of my heart,

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.262
for all you have done.

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.440
But my mistake was in thinking that it,

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.440
that it would make everything all right,

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:27.747
make it better.

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:32.742
You know, it doesn't.

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.948
'Cause I left them here.

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.662
I left them here, my love.

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:12.120
Maria.

01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:14.427
The time has come, hasn't it?

01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.231
Come here, my darling.

01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:30.910
I'm leaving now.

01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.310
You are doing the right thing.

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:37.320
But I don't want to.

01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:38.865
You must leave, Maria.

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:42.949
You must move forward.
There is no future for you here.

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:48.070
America will be your home.

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:51.310
Ja, Papa.

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:55.501
And so, from now on...

01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:58.826
we speak in the language of your future.

01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:09.240
When our family came to Vienna,

01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:11.480
Maria...

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.150
they were not rich people.

01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.425
We worked hard.

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.200
We did everything
we could to contribute,

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:22.950
and to belong.

01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:26.720
We are proud of what we have done,

01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:29.505
and we are proud of our children.

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:33.226
Nobody can take that away from us.

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.320
And now...

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.541
as you go...

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:49.102
I ask you only one thing, mein Liebling.

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.950
What is it, Papa?

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.985
Remember us.

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:29.544
Take us with you in your heart,
Maria, and learn to be happy again.

01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:00.200
So...

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.120
now?

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:05.520
I have been thinking
about that smart Mr. Lauder.

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:08.440
I think I want Adele to go
and live in his gallery.

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:12.600
My only condition is that she must
always be on public display.

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:14.760
That way, everyone can marvel at her.

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:19.200
After all, she is a little too big
for my bungalow.

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:22.349
You could buy a new bungalow.
Buy anything you want.

01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.240
I'd like a new dishwasher.

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:30.425
You know, your grandfather
would be proud of you.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:34.520
You are keeping the memory alive.

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:36.622
Well, I didn't do it alone.

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.560
Would you excuse me just for one moment?

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:45.661
Sure.

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:16.271
Can I help you?

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:20.440
I know this house. Can I look around?

01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:22.941
Of course. Please.

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:41.787
Maria, Maria Komm' her,
bring die Schleifen.
