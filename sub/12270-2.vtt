they're saying that it's you, Tara.

-You're the magic one.
-Don't tell anyone.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.600
-What does it say?
-That our Supreme Everine

00:11.800 --> 00:13.600
will lose her powers.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.640
Tell me what happened to my mother.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.760
Cotton escaped,
swearing revenge on the Everines.

# I got to take control
And write my destiny

02:49.840 --> 02:54.840
What I sew is just a prediction
of the future, a weather forecast.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.920
The pox is upon us.

15:08.040 --> 15:13.080
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

15:13.240 --> 15:17.640
Goodness. Everyone’s going to be talking
about this in school on Monday.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.600
(GASPING)
I can’t stop! Please make it stop!

15:21.760 --> 15:23.720
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

15:28.240 --> 15:32.120
(ALL) Foul yeasty canker-blots!

15:35.160 --> 15:40.200
(SCREAMING)

15:42.600 --> 15:46.680
Tara. Listen to me.
Before you finish that stitch.

15:46.840 --> 15:50.040
As a Supreme Everine,
you can make it flow the other way.

15:50.200 --> 15:55.440
This Cotton Lively, she can take
your feelings, your actions.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.680
If you want to, you can influence her.

15:59.680 --> 16:04.640
You can make her feel shame
or regret or... invisible.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.360
I know how she feels.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.960
-But it’s too late.
-Not while you can weave it’s not.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.640
Use your power, Tara. Stop her.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.160
I’m going to set her free.

16:30.160 --> 16:34.360
She was never able to meet her Fate
to become an Everine.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.600
If I can give it to her...
I can release her.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.640
(WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

17:18.360 --> 17:20.400
(DOOR RATTLES OPEN)

17:20.600 --> 17:22.400
Good for you, Supremo.

17:22.600 --> 17:27.680
(WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

17:37.600 --> 17:39.720
I am chosen!

18:01.920 --> 18:05.000
Worst day ever. (SCOFFS)

18:18.600 --> 18:20.160
(GASPS)

18:23.240 --> 18:26.440
So now you know the danger
of the power you possess.

18:28.880 --> 18:33.880
(HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING)

18:34.000 --> 18:36.640
Howdy!
(HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING)

18:36.800 --> 18:40.920
I don’t suppose you witnessed any kind
of supernatural funkiness in here?

18:41.040 --> 18:44.520
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

18:44.680 --> 18:49.160
Uh, no. I think I would’ve noticed
something like that.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.240
(SIGHS)
(HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING)

18:51.400 --> 18:54.960
What did you expect from a ghost tracker
you got from a cereal box?

18:55.080 --> 18:58.080
I had to have 1,332 breakfasts
to get this!

18:58.240 --> 18:59.720
It’s worth a fortune!

18:59.880 --> 19:02.600
-You don’t even like cereal!
-Exactly!

19:05.000 --> 19:09.320
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

19:09.520 --> 19:12.200
-You’ve earned it.
-Earned what?

19:13.800 --> 19:16.120
Today you acquired something

19:16.280 --> 19:19.800
greater than skills in weaving
and channeling Fate.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.240
Wisdom.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.720
You made an old teacher very proud.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.640
And your reward is a prediction.

19:43.240 --> 19:48.520
Oh! Great and noble tapestry.

19:48.680 --> 19:53.840
What future does Tara have
with young Cameron?

20:08.560 --> 20:10.080
What? What is it?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.360
This is Cameron.

20:16.360 --> 20:20.400
And this... is when he meets his Fate.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.080
The... end of Cameron.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.440
(GASPS) Cameron.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.800
(NARRATOR)
Next time...

20:33.960 --> 20:36.200
I need the cause
of Cameron's downfall.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.120
Mother’s prophecy. Her son destined
to be soulmate of Supreme Everine.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.120
-That's so important.
-Esmerelda found Bridget.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.680
You are the cause of Cameron's Fate.
