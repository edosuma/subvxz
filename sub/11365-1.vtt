Wrestling main event

06:27.988 --> 06:30.021
announcing
his retirement, and tonight

06:30.023 --> 06:32.891

06:32.893 --> 06:35.227
what an opponent he has.
New to the canvas,

06:35.229 --> 06:39.798
at 7 feet tall and 300 pounds,

06:39.800 --> 06:41.533
the Reaper!

06:47.508 --> 06:49.107
Woah! The Saint baseball slides

06:49.109 --> 06:52.377
right into...! One, two...
Oh! That was close!

06:52.379 --> 06:56.014
- This is awesome!
Reverse slam him!

06:56.016 --> 06:58.683
And the Reaper

06:58.685 --> 07:01.586
brandishes the Saint
with a low blow! That one

07:01.588 --> 07:04.055
will definitely
slow him down. Oh!

07:04.057 --> 07:07.058
That was just brutal!

07:07.060 --> 07:10.662
The Reaper is not letting up!

07:10.664 --> 07:14.399
He has no first match jitters.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.235
Oh! Into the turnbuckle
goes the Saint!

07:17.237 --> 07:19.438
He is strugglin'!

07:19.440 --> 07:21.440
- Take it easy, bro!
We got 2 minutes left,

07:21.442 --> 07:25.243
- The only thing spent is you,
'cause I'm coming for that belt.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.817
Reaper! Reaper!

07:31.819 --> 07:34.920
- Reaper! Reaper!
- Hear, the crowd is starting

07:34.922 --> 07:37.622
to cheer for the Reaper!

07:39.893 --> 07:42.661
Oh, this is not how the Saint

07:42.663 --> 07:46.298
wanted to go out!
- DADDY!!

07:46.300 --> 07:48.066
- It's... it's OK, sweetie,
it's just... it's just acting,

07:48.068 --> 07:52.337
remember? I told you.
It's just acting...

07:52.339 --> 07:54.806
- Yeah!

07:54.808 --> 07:56.208
- The Reaper certainly
has the Saint

07:56.210 --> 07:58.844
against the ropes...
- Good night, Saint!

07:58.846 --> 08:00.445
- and is dragging him
into the middle of the ring

08:00.447 --> 08:02.747
for what could be
a signature move!

08:07.787 --> 08:11.122
Oh yeah!

08:11.124 --> 08:13.425
Oh, that dropped knee looked
like a world of hurt

08:13.427 --> 08:17.362
for the Saint!

08:17.364 --> 08:19.064
And here goes the suplex!

08:22.301 --> 08:24.970
Oh! The Saint got
a couple of knees in!

08:24.972 --> 08:28.607
And a reverse small package!
One, two...

08:28.609 --> 08:30.408
Oh, but the Reaper breaks out!

08:34.982 --> 08:36.648
Halfway, a drop kick!

08:36.650 --> 08:38.884
It looks like the Saint
has found his second wind!

08:48.428 --> 08:51.463
Oh, that was an amazing move,
ladies and gentlemen!

08:51.465 --> 08:54.566
The first time the Reaper's
on the canvas today!

08:54.568 --> 08:56.635
The Reaper just caught
the Saint in a flying cross!

08:59.138 --> 09:03.108
- AH!

09:03.110 --> 09:04.543
- The faith breaker!

09:04.545 --> 09:06.878
- Dad just did
the faith breaker!

09:06.880 --> 09:09.080

He just pulled off

09:09.082 --> 09:11.316

Listen to that crowd, folks!
They love the man in white!

09:15.055 --> 09:18.056

doing, Christopher?

09:18.058 --> 09:22.861

- Saint! Saint! Saint!

09:22.863 --> 09:24.863
- Daddy, watch out!

09:24.865 --> 09:28.500
- Oh, man! The Reaper throws
the Saint across the ring! Oh!

09:30.770 --> 09:33.972
It looks like this match
isn't over.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.408
The Reaper grabs
the Saint's left leg!

09:36.410 --> 09:38.944
- What's happenin'? What's
happenin'? What's happenin'?

09:38.946 --> 09:41.613
- Let him go! Let him go!
- No mercy!

09:41.615 --> 09:43.014
- No-no-no-no-no!!

09:48.754 --> 09:49.754
- Daddy!

09:54.193 --> 09:56.194
- That's not right.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.900

10:01.902 --> 10:03.268
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:04.338 --> 10:07.205
WFW champion:

10:07.207 --> 10:12.410

10:12.412 --> 10:13.712

10:13.714 --> 10:15.947
Is he OK? What's wrong?
What happened?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.644
<i>- Do we want
the lampshades or no?</i>

10:45.646 --> 10:47.779
- Honey, they're
attached to the wall!

10:47.781 --> 10:49.681
- Not if you want it,
it won't be!

10:49.683 --> 10:51.983
- Maybe leave them
for the new owners

10:51.985 --> 10:54.352
so they can have
a little light too?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.922
- Your loss, Mom.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.758
- Aha!

10:59.760 --> 11:01.860
The last bedroom box standing.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.529
- I think most of
the stuff, we can donate.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.898
Right, Piper?
Pipes agrees.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.867
Go get Carrie!

11:08.869 --> 11:10.935

make the trip OK?

11:10.937 --> 11:12.704
- Ah...
- Oh, Chris!

11:12.706 --> 11:15.106
- Leg's come a long way.
- One good thing

11:15.108 --> 11:16.775
came out of all of this.
It's that the Reaper

11:16.777 --> 11:18.643
will never wrestle again.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.345
Nicky saw to that.
- Nicky...

11:20.347 --> 11:23.214
And now, you have got
a congregation to lead.

11:25.151 --> 11:28.420
- You ready for
Westside Baptist?

11:28.422 --> 11:30.488
- I'm ready for the church...

11:30.490 --> 11:33.191
I don't know if
I'm ready for Michigan.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.027
- You know, when I interviewed
with the search committee,

11:36.029 --> 11:39.330
they accurately described it
as the wrong side of the tracks.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.666
- Well, we will go
where the good Lord

11:41.668 --> 11:45.437
sends us, even though Florida
would've been a bit warmer.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.605
- Michelle, the, uh...

11:47.607 --> 11:50.141
last pastor only
lasted 3 months.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.744
One before him, 7. There were
threats made by local gangs...

11:52.746 --> 11:55.747
- Local gangs and the church
isn't doing so well, I know.

11:55.749 --> 11:59.818
The Lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.154
In the interview, they said they
wanted a fighter, didn't they?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.090
- Literally or figuratively?

12:05.092 --> 12:08.460
- I think in your case, they're
getting a little bit of both.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.762
- Got it!

12:10.764 --> 12:13.765

12:36.523 --> 12:40.692

12:52.372 --> 12:53.905
Right, hon?

Hi, I'm Tim McDonald,
Westside's treasurer.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.013

while, sorry about that.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.183

- Hello! You must be Carrie!

13:38.185 --> 13:40.051
Hi, I'm Tim.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.120
- Nice to meet you.
- Can I go play in the snow?

13:42.122 --> 13:44.422
- Oh, I... Is she
alright in the courtyard?

13:44.424 --> 13:46.758
- Absolutely!
- Of course, sweetie.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.093
I'll be out in a second.
- OK!

13:49.095 --> 13:51.963
- OK, let's go!

14:00.339 --> 14:02.340
- Oh, wow!

14:07.446 --> 14:10.448
It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

14:10.450 --> 14:15.353
- Let me introduce you to...
Is everything OK?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.754
- Yeah, everything's fine, Tim.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.524
- Perfect, actually.
- Fantastic, then.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.292
Let me introduce
you to Mrs. Beasley,

14:21.294 --> 14:24.162
our choir leader
and finance chairperson.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.532
- Oh, he's younger
than I thought he'd be!

14:27.534 --> 14:30.501
And all bunged up too!

14:30.503 --> 14:32.971
- My wife and I look forward to
working with you, Mrs. Beasley.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.173
- No, only on Wednesdays.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.242
- I'm sorry?
- Why?!

14:37.244 --> 14:39.344
- Sorry, Chris,
Mrs. Beasley doesn't

14:39.346 --> 14:41.212
understand things
so well anymore.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.148
- That, there, is my organ.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.017
- I hope you like
the sound of screeching cats,

14:46.019 --> 14:48.019
'cause that's our choir.
They give a whole new meaning

14:48.021 --> 14:49.988
to "make a joyful
noise to the Lord."

14:49.990 --> 14:54.425
- I'm outta here.
- Meow!

14:54.427 --> 14:57.562
You must be the new
pastor the search committee

14:57.564 --> 15:00.999
was so hasty to approve
while I was away on business!

15:01.001 --> 15:03.001
I hope you last
longer than the last two.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.302
I do lighting.
- Uh, pardon me?

15:04.304 --> 15:06.471
- I own Lumpkin Lighting.
Out, just in Tennessee

15:06.473 --> 15:09.507
with a big-name rock band
that rhymes with "The Bones."

15:09.509 --> 15:12.176
Yeah, we gave 'em a great show
for the tour. Pa-pa-pa-pa!!

15:12.178 --> 15:14.012
You want tickets?
I can get tickets!
- Uh, I don't think...

15:14.014 --> 15:16.281
- Uh, Judd, Judd, this
is Pastor Chris Samuels

15:16.283 --> 15:19.250
and his wife, Michelle.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Lumpkin.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.119
- Call me Judd,
unless we're in court!

15:21.121 --> 15:23.354
Saw your daughter
in the parking lot

15:23.356 --> 15:25.189
with that little rat.
Needs to be on a leash.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.225
- Oh, well... well,
she is and...

15:27.227 --> 15:29.427
and Piper's actually
a really well-behaved dog.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.364
- Oh yeah, well... I don't wanna
tell you how to run your church,
Mrs. Samuels, no, no, no.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.134
But I will! Haha! I'm the
chairman of the board, here!

15:36.136 --> 15:38.136
And I'm also Westside's
biggest supporter.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.172
- Well, I hope there's
a lot of church supporters.

15:41.174 --> 15:44.242
- Not recently,
if you catch my drift.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.344
- Yeah.
- The leg! How's the leg doing?

15:46.346 --> 15:49.280
I mean, you look pretty fit
otherwise. You think you'd be
ready for rec league?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.182
- Rec league...?
- Oh, come on, wh...

15:51.184 --> 15:53.551
God gave us the Bible
and basketball, son,

15:53.553 --> 15:57.388
ya know?! Starts
in a couple of weeks
and I need some fresh blood.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.391
Nothin' wrong with
the townies, here.
No offense, Tiny Tim. But you,

16:00.393 --> 16:03.528
you look like an athlete, huh!
- Yeah, I just, uh...
- Excellent! OK, Tim,

16:03.530 --> 16:05.229
make sure they get to the house
alright. It's beautiful!

16:05.231 --> 16:08.399
One of my investment properties
that I loan to the church.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.435
One of the perks of being me!

16:10.437 --> 16:13.237
<i>Adioso!</i>

16:13.239 --> 16:15.173
- And that was Judd!

16:15.175 --> 16:17.575
- That blowhard gone?

16:17.577 --> 16:19.243
- Here's Westside's books;

16:19.245 --> 16:21.245
among other things, it shows

16:21.247 --> 16:23.614
how behind we are
on maintenance,

16:23.616 --> 16:25.383
a recent drop in attendance

16:25.385 --> 16:28.052
and our tithes, which

16:28.054 --> 16:30.655
we have very little of.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.957
- We should change that.

16:32.959 --> 16:36.160
- What are you thinking?
- Well, when I was in seminary,

16:36.162 --> 16:39.263
they taught us when a pastor
moves into a new church,
he should

16:39.265 --> 16:40.732
go out in the neighborhood
and introduce himself.

16:40.734 --> 16:44.102
Maybe bring in some new members.
- In THIS neighborhood?

16:44.104 --> 16:47.171
Good luck with that!
- I think it's a great idea,

16:47.173 --> 16:49.774
Chris, I will go with you.
Is there somewhere

16:49.776 --> 16:52.043
we can leave Carrie?
At daycare, or..?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.112
- Well, Mrs. Samuels,
you're looking

16:54.114 --> 16:57.949
at the church board here.
We're a little understaffed.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.584
- Well, maybe that's
something I can change.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.686
- That would be
wonderful. In the meantime,

17:01.688 --> 17:04.454
Miss Edna can look after Carrie
for you, she'd be delighted.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.557
- Miss Edna?
- She's one of our church's

17:06.559 --> 17:09.961
greatest supporters.
- Like Judd...?

17:09.963 --> 17:12.030
- Oh, better than that Lumpkin!

17:13.098 --> 17:14.866
- Some strange man

17:14.867 --> 17:16.867
just called Piper a rat!

17:16.869 --> 17:18.636
- Oh, come here,
sweetie, it's OK.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.705
♪ Have a little faith

17:23.842 --> 17:27.345
♪ Feel His mercy
and compassion ♪

17:27.347 --> 17:31.482
♪ Have a little faith...

17:31.484 --> 17:32.950
- Is this the place?

17:32.952 --> 17:38.489
- This is the address
Tim gave me.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.091
- Oh!

17:40.093 --> 17:42.160
Hello! Hello, Pastor Chris!
- Hello!

17:42.162 --> 17:44.962
- I'm Miss Edna Clark; everybody
likes to call me Miss Edna.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.598
Please, come in, come in.
- Is it OK if the dog comes?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.901
- Every creature is
welcome in my home.

17:49.903 --> 17:54.338
- Thank you.
- Dollhouse! Cool!

17:54.340 --> 17:57.575
Hasn't been able
to support itself in years?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.611
- Well, Judd is the only
thing supporting that church.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.947
But, unfortunately, Judd is also

18:02.949 --> 18:04.916
the reason our congregation

18:04.918 --> 18:07.785
has fallen to less than half.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.720
Nobody can stand that man.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.790
- Maybe Judd needs
an attitude adjustment.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.991
- Chris! Um...
you'll have

18:13.993 --> 18:16.694
to excuse my husband, Miss Edna,

18:16.696 --> 18:19.030
sometimes, he forgets
he's a pastor now.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.765
- My husband and I gave
everything we had

18:20.767 --> 18:23.101
to Westside Baptist and,

18:23.103 --> 18:26.871
when the pastorship opened
again, I asked Tim:

18:26.873 --> 18:30.041
Please, Tim, find us a fighter!

18:30.043 --> 18:33.311
- That was you!
- That was me.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.853
You forgot your umbrella.
- Thank you.

18:41.855 --> 18:45.056
- So, go find some lost souls.
- We will.

18:45.058 --> 18:50.461
- Let's go play with the
dollhouse, Miss Edna.
- It's a deal, come on.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.063
- Should we do this
the old school way?

18:52.065 --> 18:54.565
- Door to door, baby.
- Ha!

18:54.567 --> 18:56.134
I don't think it's gonna rain.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.838
I told you it would rain.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.906
- Yeah.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.984
Hi, I'm Pastor Chris, this is
my wife, Michelle. We're from

19:12.986 --> 19:16.053
Westside Baptist. We're
having service on...

19:18.357 --> 19:19.457
That was fun!

19:19.459 --> 19:21.359
- There's bound to be
at least one family

19:21.361 --> 19:23.194
around here that wants
to greet us!

19:23.196 --> 19:25.463
- Yeah.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.302
Hi, I'm Pastor Chris,
this is my wife

19:31.304 --> 19:33.538
Michelle. We're
from Westside Baptist!

19:44.116 --> 19:45.716
Hi, I'm Chris Samuels,
this is my wife, Michelle.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.718
The new pastor, Westside
Baptist. We're just

19:47.720 --> 19:50.354
in the neighborhood
and we thought that...

19:53.592 --> 19:56.027
Well, that was successful!

19:56.029 --> 20:01.232
- Just means there is
still work to be done.

20:01.234 --> 20:04.135
Alright!
- No.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.636
- What?
- My leg's killing me.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.705
I just... it's just...
it's raining,

20:07.707 --> 20:12.143
can we just... I'm spent.
Can we just call it a day?

20:12.145 --> 20:13.444
- Have we really tried our best?

20:13.446 --> 20:16.681
Hm? Miss Edna said
she wanted a fighter!

20:18.584 --> 20:21.586
OK, fine,

20:21.588 --> 20:22.687
one more.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.667
See? No one's home.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.704
- I think someone's in there.

20:39.706 --> 20:43.074
- Hi, I'm Pastor Chris Samuels
and this is my...

20:43.076 --> 20:46.677
- Hi! I'm Michelle and
this is my husband Chris.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.814
He just became pastor
at Westside Baptist church.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.183
- We don't go there anymore.
- That's OK,

20:52.185 --> 20:57.521
we just wanted to introduce
ourselves to the neighborhood.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.090
- Alright, then.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.769
Come on and sit if you want.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.275
Um...

21:20.545 --> 21:22.780
This is Ashley.
- Hi, Ashley!

21:22.782 --> 21:24.582
- Ash, can you say hi
to Pastor Chris

21:24.584 --> 21:27.218
and Miss Michelle?
- Hi!

21:27.220 --> 21:28.519
- Nice to meet you, Ashley.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.589
You know, we have a little girl
about your age named Carrie.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.558
Maybe we bring her by
to play sometime?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.227
- I don't think
Ray would like that.

21:36.229 --> 21:40.598
- Is Ray your husband?
- You know, this was a bad idea.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.200
You better get going
before he comes back.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.569
- Mindy, why don't you
come to the church?

21:45.571 --> 21:48.406
- There are
things we can talk about.
- Yeah, what kind of things,

21:48.408 --> 21:50.374
Preacher?!

21:50.376 --> 21:53.244
- Hi, I'm Pastor Chris Samuels,
this is my wife Michelle.

21:53.246 --> 21:56.781
- Yeah, I heard what you said
already. We ain't interested.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.483
- Well... Mindy
seemed quite interested.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.987
- Preacher man, you don't know
the first thing about Mindy...

22:02.989 --> 22:06.557
or me. I think
you should leave, now.

22:06.559 --> 22:10.828
- We were just going... Chris.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.431
- If you change your mind,
door's always open.

22:13.433 --> 22:17.568
- Not ours! You don't come
around here no more.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.637
No one wants
what you're selling!

22:22.507 --> 22:24.942
I didn't know we were
entertaining!

22:24.944 --> 22:27.278
- I thought you were
about to hit him.
- Almost did.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.947
You saw the bruises! Someone...

22:29.949 --> 22:32.717
someone needs to teach him what
that feels like.
- Chris!

22:32.719 --> 22:34.285
We're not going down
this road again.

22:34.287 --> 22:36.620
You don't repay evil
with more evil.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.723
This isn't the wrestling
ring anymore, come on.

22:38.725 --> 22:39.857
Let's go get Carrie.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.729
♪ What a friend

22:44.731 --> 22:49.233

- Thank you, Mrs. Beasley,

23:18.431 --> 23:20.998
that was lovely.
- Screeching cats!

23:23.836 --> 23:27.905
Um, I'd like to thank
everyone for, uh,

23:27.907 --> 23:29.673
coming to my first
sermon. Today,

23:29.675 --> 23:31.675
I would like to begin
by talking about,

23:31.677 --> 23:35.012
um... no, not that one...

23:35.014 --> 23:37.415
uh... faith!

23:37.417 --> 23:39.683
Yes, faith. You see, uh,

23:39.685 --> 23:41.685
faith is, uh...

23:41.687 --> 23:44.388
Faith is what led me
to this wonderful place.

23:44.390 --> 23:47.191
Um, faith is what
we have to have to

23:47.193 --> 23:49.326
be one with God.

23:49.328 --> 23:54.031
Uh, without faith,
we would be lost.

23:54.033 --> 23:57.601
Faith is what gets us through.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.904
Faith is good...

23:59.906 --> 24:02.540
and it's... faith!

24:02.542 --> 24:04.575
Um...

24:04.577 --> 24:10.848
Um... See, faith is...

24:10.850 --> 24:13.184
Faith is great!

24:19.291 --> 24:21.258
- Alright, Care Bear...

24:21.260 --> 24:23.394
let's make this a daycare.

24:23.396 --> 24:25.863
- We have a lot of work to do.

24:25.865 --> 24:30.668
♪ ...to God in prayer

24:30.670 --> 24:32.169
- Go get 'em!

24:36.741 --> 24:39.310
- I know I've been talking
a lot about faith, lately,

24:39.312 --> 24:42.413
but, uh, there's a lot of
faithless people out there,

24:42.415 --> 24:45.416
they need to be more faithful.
So, today, let's talk

24:45.418 --> 24:50.120
about faith, again!
- He's getting better, sweetie.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.256
- Faith is... "I love you, dad."

24:52.258 --> 24:55.926
"I love you, dad."
I love you too, Carrie!

24:55.928 --> 24:57.995
Uh, my daughter, she's
so sweet. She always puts

24:57.997 --> 24:59.997
little things like this in my...

24:59.999 --> 25:01.832
my sermons and then,
I can't find my notes.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.834
- So if we could
just try to put everything

25:03.836 --> 25:06.570
over on this wall.

25:06.572 --> 25:07.705
Then, set up the carpet

25:07.707 --> 25:10.140
over there.
- Sounds good!

25:10.142 --> 25:12.276
- You know, there was
a funny story about faith

25:12.278 --> 25:15.446
that, ah... Wait, there's
actually nothing funny,

25:15.448 --> 25:18.148
I'm sorry, that was...
Wrong story!

25:18.150 --> 25:21.051
Um, faith... faith is, uh...

25:21.053 --> 25:24.088
It's faith, you know?

25:24.090 --> 25:27.525
- This is gonna be amazing!
Thank you.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.460
- Ooh! And faith is, uh...

25:29.462 --> 25:31.929
Don't go. Don't go!

25:31.931 --> 25:33.864

got some basketball tomorrow?

37:50.569 --> 37:52.202
Welcome to the home

37:52.204 --> 37:55.839
of the world's
greatest athletes:

37:55.841 --> 37:58.275
the WFW!

37:58.277 --> 38:00.110
- Are you cold, Christopher?

38:00.112 --> 38:02.345
- Uh, yeah, I just,
uh, felt... felt a chill.

38:02.347 --> 38:05.248
- In the corner to my left,

38:05.250 --> 38:07.717
the Brawler!

38:07.719 --> 38:10.520
The Brawler!
- Aah!

38:10.522 --> 38:14.257
- And in the corner to my right,

38:14.259 --> 38:16.259
ladies and gentlemen: Titan!

38:16.261 --> 38:18.328
Titan!
- Aah!!

38:18.330 --> 38:20.930
Yaah!!

38:20.932 --> 38:23.366
- Ring the bell!

38:28.307 --> 38:31.174
- Ah!

38:31.176 --> 38:33.276
Aah!!

38:33.278 --> 38:35.879
Ah!

38:39.017 --> 38:41.184
Aah!!

38:41.186 --> 38:43.219
- Do you see
how the crowd reacts?

38:43.221 --> 38:46.122
He commands this entire room!

38:46.124 --> 38:49.192
- I thought it was just because
he slammed the other guy into
the canvas. I mean,

38:49.194 --> 38:52.996
the audience, they just... they
just want blood and violence.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.699
- The audience wants someone
in whom they can have faith.

38:59.036 --> 39:01.004
Where

39:01.006 --> 39:04.808
did you get this?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.042
- Aah!

39:06.044 --> 39:08.144
Hmph!

39:08.146 --> 39:11.448
- God gave you
a gift, young man.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.983
- The Lord doesn't
love a brawler, Miss Edna.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.952
- The Lord loves anyone

39:15.954 --> 39:19.089
who fights for what
he knows is right.

39:19.091 --> 39:21.057
- Yeah, excuse me, I need to...

39:21.059 --> 39:22.992
I need to get some air.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.794
- Suit yourself, Saint.

39:31.303 --> 39:32.936
- One, two,

39:32.938 --> 39:35.605
three! Ring the bell!

39:55.326 --> 39:58.928
- Ladies and gentlemen... coming

39:58.930 --> 40:00.964
to the ring...

40:00.966 --> 40:03.933
in the cold steel blue...

40:03.935 --> 40:06.603
the king of cool...

40:06.605 --> 40:09.472
the Iceman

40:09.474 --> 40:11.141
Cometh!
- Listen

40:11.143 --> 40:14.377
to the crowd boo one of the
former heroes of the WFW,

40:14.379 --> 40:17.080
the original baby-faced Iceman

40:17.082 --> 40:20.049
Cometh! My, how
the world has changed!

40:20.051 --> 40:22.352
- And now...

40:22.354 --> 40:25.388
your worst fears
and deepest nightmares

40:25.390 --> 40:28.958
have risen.
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:28.960 --> 40:32.295
the Rrrreaper!

40:32.297 --> 40:35.098
- This is it, folks,
this is why we're here!

40:35.100 --> 40:37.867
In less than a year, the Reaper
has become the number one name

40:37.869 --> 40:41.504
in the sport and the WFW's
most feared opponent.

40:41.506 --> 40:44.240
That's 7 feet
of deadly, right there.

40:44.242 --> 40:47.076
Oh! Over the top rope
like it was a road bump!

40:47.078 --> 40:50.246
Even if you don't like him,
you gotta respect him.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.115
- You're on your own.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.931
- Oh! The Reaper goes
into the turn buckle

41:07.933 --> 41:11.067
and a faith breaker!

41:11.069 --> 41:13.102
Iceman's little nod
to his old friend, the Saint!

41:15.540 --> 41:18.341
And Reaper hits Iceman
with a sidewalk slam!

41:18.343 --> 41:20.510
Oh, that's gotta hurt
the man in blue!

41:20.512 --> 41:24.080
- Ease up!
- Not a chance!

41:24.082 --> 41:26.716
- Ooh!
- How was that?

41:26.718 --> 41:29.486
Ready for another?
- Ugh!

41:29.488 --> 41:33.089
My back! Take it easy!

41:33.091 --> 41:34.357
Ugh! What are you doing?!

41:34.359 --> 41:38.428
- Pissin' you off!
- No, I tap, I'm out!

41:38.430 --> 41:39.996
- Looks like Ice
is trying to tap off,

41:39.998 --> 41:41.865
but the Reaper
will have none of it!

41:41.867 --> 41:44.968
Reaper! Reaper! Reaper!
The crowd wants blood tonight!

41:44.970 --> 41:47.337
- There's the Reaper's
patented choke slam!

41:47.339 --> 41:49.706
It looks like Iceman
is done for the night!

41:49.708 --> 41:51.808
That slam was brutal!

41:51.810 --> 41:54.110
The Reaper's <i>modus operandi</i>
<i>is never to let up!</i>

41:54.112 --> 41:57.881
♪

41:57.883 --> 42:00.049
Oh no, what's this?
The Reaper's going

42:00.051 --> 42:02.018
into his leg breaker.
- I said no mercy!

42:06.090 --> 42:08.458
- Wait! I can't believe this!

42:08.460 --> 42:11.895
- Not this time!
- It's the Saint!

42:11.897 --> 42:13.763
- Who's this?
- Good Lord

42:13.765 --> 42:17.100
Almighty! Ha!

42:17.102 --> 42:18.801
- Hey, hey, hey!
Wake up! Wake up!

42:18.803 --> 42:20.937
- What is this? Two against one?

42:20.939 --> 42:25.475
Bring it on!
- Let's do it to him!

42:25.477 --> 42:26.776
- This is incredible, everybody!

42:26.778 --> 42:29.178
The Saint, back from
the dead, and Iceman

42:29.180 --> 42:31.781
are tag teaming
against the Reaper!

42:31.783 --> 42:35.018
I don't even know if this is
legal, but if the ref
ain't stoppin' it,

42:35.020 --> 42:37.153
they're gonna win the battle!

42:42.927 --> 42:45.528
- Get him, boys!

42:51.335 --> 42:54.904

42:54.906 --> 42:57.073

One, two, three!

42:57.075 --> 42:59.342
It's over!

42:59.344 --> 43:02.045
It's over! The Reaper
has been defeated

43:02.047 --> 43:04.581
for the first time
in his career!

43:04.583 --> 43:06.916
- Ladies and gentlemen,
you've just seen

43:06.918 --> 43:09.519
history: the return

43:09.521 --> 43:12.288

- This is over, Nicky. You said

43:36.348 --> 43:38.615

- I lied.

43:38.617 --> 43:41.651
Reaper's the hottest cod
I got in the WFW.

43:41.653 --> 43:44.187
After you left, I couldn't get a
good guy good enough, you know?

43:44.189 --> 43:47.390

- Thank you, Mrs. Beasley
and the choir.

53:01.212 --> 53:03.279
Today...

53:13.957 --> 53:17.293
Today, we need help.

53:17.295 --> 53:20.563
As you all know, we recently
lost some of our funding

53:20.565 --> 53:23.832
and... we need the help
of all of you.

53:23.834 --> 53:27.536
- There's more people here now
that Judd's out of the picture.

53:29.407 --> 53:33.342
Please! Look, this church...

53:33.344 --> 53:34.376
it's stronger or weaker

53:34.378 --> 53:37.012
because of every one
of its members,

53:37.014 --> 53:40.683
not a single person. Now,

53:40.685 --> 53:43.652
I keep hearing about
the problems the church has.

53:43.654 --> 53:47.323
About... how it can't
sustain itself.

53:47.325 --> 53:50.593
Can't pay its bills.
Keep hearing that...

53:50.595 --> 53:52.528
roof can't be fixed.

53:52.530 --> 53:56.765
Or, there's not enough
staff for daycare.

53:56.767 --> 53:59.668
Let me ask you a question.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.705
Who here...

54:02.707 --> 54:06.675
works for a bank?

54:06.677 --> 54:07.810
Go on, raise your hand

54:07.812 --> 54:09.878
if you do.

54:09.880 --> 54:13.749
- I'm with the IRS.
- That counts!

54:13.751 --> 54:16.685
That counts. Now...

54:16.687 --> 54:19.955
who here works in construction?

54:21.925 --> 54:24.693
There you go.
Who here's a plumber?

54:24.695 --> 54:28.330
That's right. Who here...

54:28.332 --> 54:30.933
can take care of children
in their time off?

54:30.935 --> 54:34.236
All right.

54:34.238 --> 54:37.139
So now, I ask you:

54:37.141 --> 54:39.275
How does this
church have problems?

54:39.277 --> 54:43.012
How does this church
continue to struggle...

54:43.014 --> 54:44.847
when, inside its walls,

54:44.849 --> 54:46.949
we have the people
we need to fix it?

54:46.951 --> 54:49.451
Ah, crap!

54:54.892 --> 54:57.593
- Now... as I was sayin;

54:57.595 --> 55:00.696
I'm not talking about faith.
- Amen!

55:00.698 --> 55:02.898
- No, no, I believe
we have faith in spades.

55:02.900 --> 55:05.401
What I'm talking
about is actions,

55:05.403 --> 55:08.871
and actions always
speak louder than words.

55:08.873 --> 55:11.573
I'm... I'm sorry,
is there a problem here?

55:11.575 --> 55:13.909
- I think I'm the problem,
I'm so sorry!

55:13.911 --> 55:15.544
No! No, Miss, Miss, wait! Wait!

55:15.546 --> 55:18.647
Wait! Come back.

55:18.649 --> 55:21.183
Come back...

55:27.157 --> 55:29.158
Pastor Chris Samuels.

55:29.160 --> 55:32.561
- Valerie.
- It's nice to meet you.

55:32.563 --> 55:34.496
I would like to apologize...

55:34.498 --> 55:38.133
on behalf of the congregation...

55:38.135 --> 55:41.603
not properly
welcoming you to church.

55:41.605 --> 55:43.372
Valerie, I'm sorry, it seems

55:43.374 --> 55:46.442
that this church is judging you.

55:46.444 --> 55:49.044
It's looking down on you.

55:49.046 --> 55:51.747
So I'm-a draw
a line right here,

55:51.749 --> 55:53.115
right now.

55:55.018 --> 55:57.753
Anyone who has never sinned,
I want you to cross that line.

56:01.725 --> 56:03.992
Come on!

56:03.994 --> 56:06.729
You were all so quick
to condemn her...

56:06.731 --> 56:09.965
to tell her
she doesn't belong...

56:09.967 --> 56:11.133
Makes me sad.

56:11.135 --> 56:13.168
But I'm here to tell you folks:

56:13.170 --> 56:16.739
We can't keep praying
while we sit on our hands.

56:18.541 --> 56:21.777

actually there, I wouldn't

57:00.951 --> 57:03.886
And then, suddenly,
he came out of nowhere.

57:03.888 --> 57:05.954
- Who did?
- This man!

57:05.956 --> 57:08.724
It was...

57:08.726 --> 57:12.227
You know, Pastor,
I went to church as a
kid, but I lost my faith.

57:12.229 --> 57:14.897
I started praying, maybe
a couple of weeks ago

57:14.899 --> 57:18.867
when I thought I hit my lowest
point and I don't know why.

57:18.869 --> 57:25.007
I was praying again for someone
to help, for anyone to help.

57:25.009 --> 57:27.709
And he sent me an angel.
- You know, Valerie,

57:27.711 --> 57:31.380
God doesn't always respond
the way we think He should...

57:31.382 --> 57:32.848
but He always responds.

57:32.850 --> 57:35.651
- Well, that, he did, Pastor.

57:35.653 --> 57:37.519
- I'm just glad you were
able to get in that shelter.

57:37.521 --> 57:41.223
And just remember;
these church's doors
are always open to you.

57:41.225 --> 57:42.691
- Pastor Chris,
I didn't tell you

57:42.693 --> 57:46.228
I'm staying at a shelter.

57:46.230 --> 57:47.596
- Uh...

57:47.598 --> 57:50.766
yes,
I just... I assumed...

57:50.768 --> 57:54.069
- Thank you!

57:54.071 --> 57:55.604
Thank you!

57:57.774 --> 58:00.342
I have other friends that
need help too, would it...

58:00.344 --> 58:02.277
be OK if I bring them
to your next sermon?

58:02.279 --> 58:05.314
The streets dish out
all sorts of crazy.

58:05.316 --> 58:09.318
- Like I said:
The door's always open.

58:33.376 --> 58:35.711
I forgot how much kids cost you
before they get here.

58:35.713 --> 58:37.846
- And afterwards too!

58:37.848 --> 58:40.415
Carrie needs new winter boots.

58:42.887 --> 58:45.120
- Judd leaving was the reason
why I had the congregation

58:45.122 --> 58:47.656
to step up in the first place.

58:47.658 --> 58:51.360
Valerie arrives, people
start coming around, but...

58:51.362 --> 58:53.829
the baby?
- The Lord never gives us...

58:53.831 --> 58:55.831
- more than we can handle.

58:55.833 --> 58:59.601
- I know. And I believe He's
been watchin' out for us, I do,

58:59.603 --> 59:02.371
but...

59:04.207 --> 59:07.142
we need money, Michelle.

59:07.144 --> 59:09.478
I mean; if we can't
take care of ourselves,

59:09.480 --> 59:12.481
how do we take
care of the church?

59:12.483 --> 59:14.349
- Because...

59:14.351 --> 59:16.318
the Lord...

59:16.320 --> 59:18.820
always provides.

59:18.822 --> 59:21.290
- Wh-wh-what are you saying?

59:21.292 --> 59:23.392
- I am saying

59:23.394 --> 59:26.495
that Miss Edna and I
think you have a gift.

59:26.497 --> 59:28.263
- You've been
talking to Miss Edna!

59:28.265 --> 59:30.866
- She may have been
planting some seeds.

59:30.868 --> 59:33.835
- She's a good seed planter.
- And this gift...

59:33.837 --> 59:35.971
not only do you love it, you are

59:35.973 --> 59:37.806
good at it,
but it can also provide

59:37.808 --> 59:40.409
for our family and the church.

59:40.411 --> 59:43.946
- Yeah, but... but wrestling?

59:43.948 --> 59:46.915
- Where in the Bible
does it say: "Thou shalt
not wrestle", huh?

59:51.187 --> 59:54.189
- I just don't want
to be an embarrassment.

59:54.191 --> 59:55.157
- You have loved wrestling

59:55.159 --> 59:57.693
since I've met you and you have

59:57.695 --> 01:00:00.462
practiced it since you were
a kid and if you work hard

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:02.598
at something you love
and believe in it

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.566
to the very best of
your ability, how could you

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:07.202
ever be an embarrassment?

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:09.771

You know, I've seen

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:18.139
Judd sulk back to a few

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:21.643
in the back, where he belongs.
- "Where he belongs"?!

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:23.244
- Yes, ma'am.

01:06:23.246 --> 01:06:28.350
- I've heard those words
in my lifetime, too.

when you decided to change

01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:37.592

Every time I speak to you,
it's "I".

you're in such a hurry.

- Yes.

- I was at the church, Ray!

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:09.090

I made myself pretty clear
about that church!

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:10.925

going to church?!

- You know what i...

to give you an explanation!

nothing wrong with me going!

First of all, there's something
wrong with that guy, OK?!

01:16:35.158 --> 01:16:37.725
- Am I under arrest, Detective?

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:42.063
- No, ma'am, you are not.

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:48.402
- Like I said before,
the man was a saint.

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:51.038
- A saint. Yeah, I got it.
- Yes.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.574
He was.

01:16:57.313 --> 01:16:58.412
<i>Can I have my donut now?</i>

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:08.556
- Sorry, Carrie, we...
we're all out of donuts.

01:17:08.558 --> 01:17:10.024
But I promise

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:12.093
that next time you come
- and you will come again-

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:15.096
I'll get you a whole dozen
just for you. Haha!

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:17.131
- OK! Let's come back soon!

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:20.568

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:21.769

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:24.005
- Not today.

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:26.607
- Then I guess we're done here.
Come on, Carrie.

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:29.410
- Chris!

01:17:29.412 --> 01:17:32.747
You sure you don't play poker?

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:33.814
- I'm positive, Ross.

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.783
- Do you mind if I give you
a little advice

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:37.418
that I got from the tables
when I was winning?

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.654
- OK.
- Sometimes,

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:43.090
it's better to be
lucky than good.

01:17:43.092 --> 01:17:46.394
- Lucky for you, Detective,
I don't believe in luck.

01:17:46.396 --> 01:17:48.696
- Well, luck, God, whatever
you believe in. Sometimes,

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:53.100
you should just quit...
while you're ahead.

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:55.536
- Is that a threat?

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:59.974
- No, that's just
some friendly advice.

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:03.110
We're friends, ain't we?
- Can I ask you a question?

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:06.047
I notice you wear a cross
around your neck...

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:08.983
you go to church?

01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:11.052
- Cross belonged to my brother.

01:18:11.054 --> 01:18:14.722
When he died, I just didn't
see no reason to go to church.

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:18.993
- A man who believes in luck,
but not God...

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:23.864

we can talk.

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:25.700

to pay for the repairs.

Look at the graffiti!

thug that did this is still
out there.

that tears this church apart.

noticed, Pastor, our
church is already torn apart.

to a better place?

- And your husband
is still drunk at home!

- That's enough! I will
step down from this pulpit

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.880

to one of our members that way.

01:23:39.882 --> 01:23:42.783

you stepped down then.

from anywhere!

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:59.800
But I know you don't
kick a man when he's down.

01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:01.068
The Christian thing to do is,
you offer him a hand

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:03.737
to help him back up!
- Oh, shut up, Judd!

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:07.608
- Let the man speak!

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:11.078
- Thank you,
Mrs. Beasley!

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.680
You know, a very wise man
once said to me,

01:24:13.682 --> 01:24:17.017
"You gotta have a little faith."

01:24:17.019 --> 01:24:19.686
I'm all about that.

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:22.723
Heck, even my very successful
lighting company,

01:24:22.725 --> 01:24:26.360

was once in chapter 11.

Mm-hmm.

01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:31.598

and I got a second chance.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.102
Just like I'm here today asking
all of you for a second chance.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:38.505
And if Pastor Chris thinks
he can turn this church around

01:24:38.507 --> 01:24:41.108
again, then I have faith in him.

01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:44.244
I think he deserves our
forgiveness and a second chance.

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:51.919
- Our church is still standing,

01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:53.020
and we have found

01:24:53.022 --> 01:24:54.088
our leader.

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:57.825
- What say the congregation?

01:24:57.827 --> 01:25:00.928
- It's good with me!
Give him a chance!

01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:05.666
- I think, maybe...

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:08.969
maybe Pastor Chris
should lead us in a prayer.

01:25:08.971 --> 01:25:10.971
Yeah.

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:15.642

your second chance, Pastor.

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:17.644

01:28:08.384 --> 01:28:10.684
Therefore, any agreement
I have with the Saint,

01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:13.787
I don't honor it either.
- Don't talk to me about honor.

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:16.056
This time, I'm asking
for this one thing.

01:28:16.058 --> 01:28:18.325
It's not for me;
it's for the church.

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:20.394
I want a shot at the title

01:28:20.396 --> 01:28:22.896
and winning back the belt
from the Reaper fair and square.

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:25.132
- I say who wins and loses.
- This time, you're gonna

01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:27.100
let me battle it out.
Fair fight.

01:28:27.102 --> 01:28:29.102
There hasn't been a fair fight

01:28:29.104 --> 01:28:32.105
in pro wrestling since the 70s.
- You're gonna make
history then.

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:34.308
- And what if I just say,
"No, Chris,"

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:36.310
what are you gonna do?
Body-slam me?

01:28:36.312 --> 01:28:37.644
- No...

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:39.746
but we are here to audit you.

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:42.983
- I'm Lauren Vanderbraun from
the Internal Revenue Service.

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:45.118
I have several questions

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.388
regarding your WFW Corporation.

01:28:56.931 --> 01:28:58.932
- Oh, a cage match,

01:28:58.934 --> 01:29:01.735
this is gonna be awesome!
- Those are my lights.

01:29:01.737 --> 01:29:05.672
- Pardon?
- Those lights, Lumpkin
Lighting. A tax write-off.

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:08.075
Right, Mrs. Vanderbraun?

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:17.351
- Jojo... Enjoy that.

01:29:17.353 --> 01:29:18.852
<i>Ashley!</i>

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:22.022
- Hi, Carrie.
- Mindy! Oh, Ray!

01:29:22.024 --> 01:29:23.857
Oh, it's so good
both of you could make it.

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:26.393
- Ray had something
he wanted to say.

01:29:26.395 --> 01:29:30.630
- I just wanted to apologize
to you, the family,
and the church.

01:29:30.632 --> 01:29:33.967
If it's not too late,
I'd like to come to
the next service.

01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:35.902
- It's never too late, Ray.
- I really wanted

01:29:35.904 --> 01:29:38.372
to apologize to
your husband as well.

01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:41.641
- Well, he is getting ready for
the fight of his life right now.

01:29:41.643 --> 01:29:45.846
- Lord, I'm not praying
about faith,

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:47.814
because I believe
in your love and fortitude

01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:51.118
now more than ever.
What I'm praying for

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.120
is your strength.

01:29:53.122 --> 01:29:56.757
- I knew that was you
at the hospital.

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:02.062
See, you took my streets,
you took my girl,

01:30:02.064 --> 01:30:06.099
you took my customers.
Ever since you opened up

01:30:06.101 --> 01:30:08.602
your doors to every crackhead
and call girl in this county,

01:30:08.604 --> 01:30:10.604
you took my livelihood!

01:30:10.606 --> 01:30:13.106
And I want it all back.

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:14.875
- Those people weren't yours
to begin with.

01:30:14.877 --> 01:30:17.944
- So what do you suggest we do,
Padre? How do we end this?

01:30:17.946 --> 01:30:20.280
- Do what Valerie did.

01:30:20.282 --> 01:30:23.750
Come to church.
Seek forgiveness.

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:28.188
- Ha ha ha! See, ain't nobody
gonna forgive me, preacher man.

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:31.858
- You're wrong. There's one
who forgives all of us.

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.860
Even you.

01:30:33.862 --> 01:30:37.130
- I like you. I do,

01:30:37.132 --> 01:30:38.732
but I don't think
God's gonna forgive me...

01:30:38.734 --> 01:30:41.668
- Aah!

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:47.941
- Ray, wh... What-what
are you doing here?

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:49.843
- Uh...

01:30:49.845 --> 01:30:52.679
Well...

01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:54.881
I came here to apologize.

01:30:54.883 --> 01:30:57.851
- Well... apology accepted.

01:30:57.853 --> 01:30:59.953
- The Lord works

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:01.822
in mysterious ways.

01:31:01.824 --> 01:31:04.424
Jojo, Chris,

01:31:04.426 --> 01:31:06.593
and Ray...

01:31:06.595 --> 01:31:10.797
Lot of domestics
going on at your place, Ray.

01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:15.235
You ain't gonna have to worry
about that no more, Officer.

01:31:15.237 --> 01:31:17.537
I can swear on that.

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:19.539
- Detective, actually.

01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:22.075
- Right, D-detective.

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:24.077
- Go on, get out of here, Ray.

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:26.079
And don't worry about Jojo.

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:28.582
When he wakes up,
it's gonna be behind bars.

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:33.954
Go on.

01:31:33.956 --> 01:31:36.623
Folks just keep ending up
going to sleep on you, Pastor.

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.694
- Should I cancel the fight?
- I need you

01:31:40.696 --> 01:31:44.097
to be the last man
standing in that cage.

01:31:44.099 --> 01:31:46.600
- What about, uh...
quitting while I was ahead?

01:31:46.602 --> 01:31:48.768
- Well, sometimes,
you gotta go all in.

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:52.105
I learned that
at the tables too. Hahaha!

01:31:52.107 --> 01:31:53.473
- Yeah.

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:07.354

I'm Nicky Stone

01:32:09.424 --> 01:32:13.960

the main event of the evening!

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:43.557

for the WFW Heavyweight
Championship!

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:52.599
And his opponent,

01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:55.302
from the depths of darkness,

01:32:55.304 --> 01:32:57.637
bringing the battle
of good and evil

01:32:57.639 --> 01:32:59.606
to its knees,

01:32:59.608 --> 01:33:04.644
the WFW Heavyweight champion!

01:33:04.646 --> 01:33:06.479
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:08.848
the Reaper!

01:33:22.496 --> 01:33:24.064
Gentlemen,

01:33:24.066 --> 01:33:27.067
this is for the WFW

01:33:27.069 --> 01:33:28.835
Heavyweight Championship.

01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:31.438
Two men walked in;

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:36.142
one man walks out.
This is it, boys. This is it.

01:33:36.144 --> 01:33:38.979
It's been a long time

01:33:38.981 --> 01:33:41.548
for the second coming, Saint.

01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:45.719
And the Reaper's here
to take your soul, again.

01:33:45.721 --> 01:33:47.721
- I'm coming for that belt.

01:33:47.723 --> 01:33:51.391
- You'll have to rip it
from my cold, dead body.

01:33:51.393 --> 01:33:52.759
- Your choice.

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:29.963
- Yes.
- It looks so real!

01:34:29.965 --> 01:34:32.732
- It's just a show, Carrie.

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:37.971
- You forgot one thing,
Preacher.
- No.

01:34:37.973 --> 01:34:41.307
- If God's with you,
then who will rise against you?

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:45.045
Me!

01:34:45.047 --> 01:34:46.946

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:51.951
Ugh!
