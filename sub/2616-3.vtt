WEBVTT

01:06.215 --> 01:07.884
Got the northbound lane shut down.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.011
P.D.'s questioning everyone.

01:10.052 --> 01:11.762
And what are they saying?

01:11.846 --> 01:13.055
She appeared upset.

01:13.264 --> 01:15.433
Pushed her way through the crowd,
toward the street.

01:15.433 --> 01:18.102
And then just went flying through the air.

01:18.102 --> 01:21.606
The damage on the bus is front and center,
so that takes timing.

01:23.441 --> 01:24.233
Suicide?

01:24.233 --> 01:25.818
I don't think so.

01:25.902 --> 01:28.696
You don't spend a thousand
dollars on clothes

01:29.906 --> 01:31.991
that you're never going to wear.

02:20.987 --> 02:24.616
We'd have a better chance charting
what isn't broken on this girl.

02:24.908 --> 02:26.368
Poor baby.

02:26.659 --> 02:28.828
Both arms shattered.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.748
Torso twisted like
a corkscrew...

02:31.748 --> 02:36.544
Based on the points of impact, Alexx,
she landed at seven

02:39.464 --> 02:41.508
and then rolled all the way to you.

02:42.467 --> 02:43.927
Eric.

02:43.927 --> 02:47.263
That Metrobus doesn't make scheduled
stops here at the Marketplace.

02:47.263 --> 02:49.516
He was going to Brickell Park
doing 45 miles an hour.

02:49.599 --> 02:51.267
More than enough.

02:51.476 --> 02:52.060
Lieutenant?

02:53.103 --> 02:53.937
I'm Officer Wolfe.

02:53.978 --> 02:56.356
I ascertained that there are no
surveillance cameras at the scene,

02:56.356 --> 03:00.360
so I canvassed the witnesses to see if
there was any camera or video equipment
that might have filmed it.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.444
Got a couple names, sir.

03:01.486 --> 03:03.154
Thank you, Wolfe. We'll take it from here.

03:03.154 --> 03:03.947
Yes, sir.

03:04.906 --> 03:05.698
He's thorough.

03:05.698 --> 03:07.575
Yes. Follow up, please.

03:07.575 --> 03:08.993
Will do, Lieutenant.

03:10.537 --> 03:11.663
Yes, ma'am?

03:11.663 --> 03:14.707
- Find an I.D. yet?
- No, I didn't. Have you?

03:14.707 --> 03:17.335
Marketplace security
apprehended a shoplifter.

03:17.627 --> 03:21.631
Confiscated some DVDs..
and this: a $500 wallet.

03:22.590 --> 03:23.967
And it's a woman's wallet.

03:24.551 --> 03:26.052
Our victim ...

03:26.052 --> 03:29.889
...has expensive taste, doesn't she?

03:29.889 --> 03:31.724
"Katrina Hannagan."

03:37.605 --> 03:40.233
- Bring him in?
- By all means.

03:46.239 --> 03:52.161
Well, according to your rap sheet,
you've been arrested twice before
at the same place.

03:52.161 --> 03:55.498
And did I push any of them
in front of a bus? No.

03:55.498 --> 03:57.208
And I didn't push this lady.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.335
Maybe she tripped, that it?

03:59.335 --> 04:01.713
I was never on that curb.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.048
I work the elevators.

04:04.048 --> 04:07.010
Girls' hands are always filled with
shopping bags. You don't even
need a weapon.

04:07.010 --> 04:08.511
Check out my key chain.

04:08.511 --> 04:11.264
One little laser pointer and girls
are shakin' in their high heels.

04:13.016 --> 04:15.310
Don't turn around.
Stare at the door.

04:15.310 --> 04:17.437
Lift your right arm.
Do it!

04:18.771 --> 04:20.398
When that door opens, get out.

04:20.398 --> 04:23.735
And don't turn around.
Remember, I have your address.

04:27.363 --> 04:29.949
Opportunity-- that's all it was.

04:30.950 --> 04:32.994
No knife, no gun; no violence.

04:32.994 --> 04:36.164
Detective, where did we pick
our friend Pete up?

04:36.164 --> 04:38.791
Far end of the Plaza,
near Third Street.

04:38.791 --> 04:42.170
That's an awful lot of ground to cover
in a such a short period of time.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.130
I told you, I didn't put her
in front of that bus.

04:44.130 --> 04:47.175
No, but you motivated her to run
towards it, didn't you, Pete?

04:51.888 --> 04:53.306
Excuse me.

04:55.808 --> 04:56.893
- Horatio.
- Yeah?

04:56.976 --> 04:59.270
Your appointment's here, Ryan Wolfe.

04:59.312 --> 05:02.065
First officer from the Metrobus case.

05:02.065 --> 05:04.776
He's asked me to put in a good word
for him.

05:04.776 --> 05:06.694
So he's not shy.

05:07.153 --> 05:12.575
Look, he's got a Bachelor's in chemistry,
and he works patrol until he finishes
his Masters in genetics.

05:12.575 --> 05:15.286
Sounds like I should talk to him then.

05:15.286 --> 05:16.704
Sit tight, Pete.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.458
Lieutenant.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.419
- Thanks for meeting with me.
- No problem. Step over here, Wolfe.

05:25.338 --> 05:28.674
So Detective Salas tells me that
you're thinking about a career change.

05:28.674 --> 05:30.718
Only if I can be a criminalist.

05:31.094 --> 05:32.929
I've done a dozen ride-alongs
with homicide.

05:32.929 --> 05:35.848
Aced quantitative analysis.
Hit all the seminars.

05:35.848 --> 05:37.100
I'm ready.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.559
Okay, so no more patrol.

05:38.559 --> 05:40.853
Patrol's great, but there's
no follow-through.

05:40.853 --> 05:42.897
Dispatch calls, you move on.

05:42.897 --> 05:46.359
CSI, you stay till the case
is solved, victim's buried.

05:46.776 --> 05:49.070
Okay. Let me see your service pistol.

05:49.529 --> 05:50.321
Sir?

05:50.321 --> 05:52.156
Your weapon. Let me see it.

06:01.457 --> 06:02.750
You clean this every week?

06:03.251 --> 06:04.877
More. I'm a little O.C.D.

06:04.877 --> 06:07.547
Drives the Watch Commander crazy.

06:08.005 --> 06:09.507
Okay, let me see your back-up.

06:19.851 --> 06:21.769
That is quite a case of O.C.D., Wolfe.

06:23.771 --> 06:25.231
Did I just lose this job?

06:25.606 --> 06:28.609
You know what? I need to think about it.
Have a seat over there.

06:41.455 --> 06:43.624
Hey, Stephanie. Someone's here to see me?

06:47.420 --> 06:48.379
Dad.

06:54.051 --> 06:55.845
I've really done it this time.

06:58.097 --> 06:59.015
What happened?

06:59.015 --> 07:00.975
I didn't know where else to go.

07:01.517 --> 07:02.977
Calleigh, I...

07:05.438 --> 07:07.315
I think I killed someone.

07:07.940 --> 07:11.736
What? What do you mean,
you think you killed somebody?

07:11.736 --> 07:12.987
With my car.

07:12.987 --> 07:14.530
When did this happen?

07:16.824 --> 07:18.200
Before sunup.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.368
Where?

07:21.621 --> 07:22.914
You don't remember.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.542
Show me the car.

07:30.671 --> 07:32.715
You definitely hit something.

07:34.050 --> 07:36.177
Maybe just a stanchion...

07:44.435 --> 07:45.728
Dad.

07:46.020 --> 07:47.438
Is it blood?

07:48.898 --> 07:51.067
It's blood, isn't it?

07:51.067 --> 07:53.944
Oh, God, that's the first drink I've
had in six months.

07:54.904 --> 07:57.281
What do I do now?
What happens now?

07:57.281 --> 07:58.783
Take another one.

07:58.783 --> 07:59.617
What?!

08:00.159 --> 08:02.161
That's what got me here in
the first place, Calleigh.

08:02.161 --> 08:04.914
You came to me for help. I'm offering
you help. Take another drink.

08:04.914 --> 08:07.625
A drink? Well, well, I can't see how...

08:07.708 --> 08:08.709
Just do it!

08:19.470 --> 08:23.766
Katrina Hannagan's family says
she was seeing a guy named Jay Seaver.

08:23.766 --> 08:27.395
He works at Grove-Turner Advertising
in a building near the plaza.

08:27.395 --> 08:31.524
Which was where Katrina was killed.
Have Mr. Seaver come in to see me immediately.

08:32.607 --> 08:33.943
Horatio.

08:34.402 --> 08:35.443
Hey.

08:36.236 --> 08:38.864
You remember my dad,
Kenwall Duquesne.

08:38.864 --> 08:41.616
Sure. Good to see you again, sir.
- Hi.

08:41.616 --> 08:43.034
Is there someplace we can talk?

08:43.577 --> 08:46.997
Uh, I... I think we're okay right here.
What's going on?

08:47.248 --> 08:51.752
My dad has come to turn himself in.
I was thinking Detective
Tripp would be best.

08:54.130 --> 08:57.758
My car was involved in a... in a...
in a incident last night.

08:57.883 --> 09:00.803
Sir, is the scotch on your breath
related to that incident?

09:00.886 --> 09:04.140
My dad took a drink to calm his nerves
before we came in. I witnessed it.

09:04.348 --> 09:06.600
So the blood alcohol test
is not going to help us then.

09:07.226 --> 09:10.604
You do realize that you're riding
the line on this, right?

09:12.523 --> 09:13.858
Okay, Frank, please.

09:13.858 --> 09:17.820
Yep. Dad, do you mind waiting?
- Oh, sure.

09:18.195 --> 09:20.656
I'd like to stay on the case.
- I don't think that would be a good idea.

09:20.656 --> 09:24.160
I think we need somebody who's not
biased to you or your father.

09:24.785 --> 09:26.495
Someone from the night shift?

09:26.495 --> 09:28.330
I'm thinking patrol.

09:28.330 --> 09:31.333
Patrol? A newbie? They don't even
know how it works at CSI.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.753
I need you to trust me on this. Wolfe?
- Yes, sir.

09:36.172 --> 09:37.756
Wolfe, you're hired.

09:37.756 --> 09:40.217
Um, well, what about the paperwork?

09:40.217 --> 09:43.179
You let me worry about that--
you're on the clock.
Mount up. Go ahead, son.

09:43.179 --> 09:44.180
Okay.

09:46.307 --> 09:48.601
Do me a favor and go with me on this one,
all right?

09:49.518 --> 09:50.644
It's your order.

10:26.472 --> 10:31.435
Well, Horatio, we can rule out
suicide for our Metrobus victim.

10:31.435 --> 10:33.062
What do we have then, Alexx?

10:33.062 --> 10:38.108
Fresh bruise square on her back.
Perimortem. Could be from a hand.

10:39.276 --> 10:42.071
So no hesitation and all force.

10:47.159 --> 10:49.495
Your hunch was right. It's a homicide.

10:49.536 --> 10:50.704
Okay, what else?

10:50.704 --> 10:55.542
Subcutaneous pictures show
massive bruising on Miss Hannagan.
Older bruising.

10:58.587 --> 11:00.255
Hemoglobin had time to break down.

11:00.255 --> 11:03.842
Inner thighs. Extremities. Broken wrist.

11:03.842 --> 11:07.638
Think our girl was a victim long before
that bus hit her, and look.

11:07.638 --> 11:09.223
No wedding ring.

11:09.223 --> 11:10.849
But she does have a boyfriend.

11:10.849 --> 11:12.810
His name his Jay Seaver.

11:14.186 --> 11:16.313
I can't believe this
happened to Katrina.

11:16.313 --> 11:18.190
How long have you been
seeing each other?

11:18.190 --> 11:20.776
A couple of months.
I saw her when I could.

11:20.776 --> 11:23.070
The ad business kinda eats
up the hours, you know?

11:23.070 --> 11:25.614
I understood that you work near
the Marketplace.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.492
What were you doing at noon?

11:28.492 --> 11:29.785
Company gym, in the basement.

11:29.785 --> 11:34.164
Pickup games, Full court. Every
Monday and Wednesday,
with the guys in the office.

11:34.164 --> 11:35.582
You could ask anyone.

11:35.582 --> 11:38.711
Should I ask them about the
bruises on Katrina's body?

11:38.919 --> 11:40.879
Those. Yeah.

11:40.879 --> 11:43.549
I asked her about those, too.

11:43.549 --> 11:48.470
She said she was getting clumsy,
kept falling down in public.

11:48.470 --> 11:49.763
I told her to see a doctor.

11:49.763 --> 11:51.056
I thought it was an inner-ear problem.

11:51.056 --> 11:53.183
Then she was hit by a bus.

11:54.351 --> 11:59.440
I see where this is going, but
I didn't do it. I loved Katrina.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.858
Jay.

12:00.858 --> 12:04.736
I think that you're not
telling me something.

12:06.363 --> 12:07.489
Like what?

12:07.739 --> 12:08.949
I don't know yet.

12:19.523 --> 12:23.903
Hey, Tyler, you get anything off that
digital camera that the, uh, officer
found at the scene?

12:23.903 --> 12:26.739
Yeah, I copied all the shots
on to the hard drive.

12:26.739 --> 12:29.784
These are not your grandparents'
vacation pictures.

12:32.203 --> 12:36.332
Miami air, man. Makes people do things
they'd never do back home.

12:36.299 --> 12:37.550
Anything at the Marketplace?

12:38.217 --> 12:40.553
This looks like the curb out front.

12:40.553 --> 12:43.181
Our victim was behind this cameraman.

12:43.181 --> 12:45.433
We're looking the wrong way.
Do they ever turn around?

12:47.351 --> 12:48.978
No. That's it.

12:48.978 --> 12:51.063
Great. Doesn't help us at all.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.189
Maybe it does.

12:52.857 --> 12:55.443
I've-I've got some software
that can magnify their eyes.

12:55.443 --> 12:56.652
To catch a reflection?

12:56.652 --> 13:00.823
Yeah, in the tear fluid.
If the eye is hydrated enough,
makes a great mirror.

13:00.823 --> 13:04.160
We'll see what the couple's
looking at. Let's do it.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.995
Get back to me when you get something.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.795
You dove right in.

13:16.047 --> 13:17.840
I'm used to following orders.

13:18.299 --> 13:19.759
You'll be thorough, right?

13:20.968 --> 13:23.304
Could you put your hands
in your pockets, please?

13:23.304 --> 13:24.597
I beg your pardon?

13:24.597 --> 13:26.849
Conflict of interest could
compromise the case.

13:27.016 --> 13:28.184
How is the case?

13:28.351 --> 13:31.437
Phenolphthalein indicated blood
on the undercarriage and rims.

13:31.646 --> 13:33.606
Hematrace says it's human.

13:33.606 --> 13:34.732
What about the orange paint?

13:34.732 --> 13:38.444
Iridescent flecks suggest
he also hit a traffic sign.

13:38.444 --> 13:41.113
Oh, good, that's something we
can use to pinpoint the location.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.908
Um... Your hands.

13:43.908 --> 13:45.368
I'm ten feet away.

13:46.202 --> 13:47.578
Eight and a half.

13:50.164 --> 13:52.333
Officer Duquesne, I know
it's my first day.

13:52.333 --> 13:57.880
Regardless, uncovering the truth is more
important to me than proving myself,
so if you don't mind...

13:59.256 --> 14:00.675
I'm not finished yet.

14:12.770 --> 14:13.979
Yeah.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.107
Seaver's office?

14:16.107 --> 14:18.192
That's not a coincidence.
I'm on my way.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.562
Eric.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.230
What did you get?

14:56.480 --> 14:58.274
Elevator's been out of service.

14:58.274 --> 15:00.025
Repairman found the body.

15:04.989 --> 15:07.324
Okay, so then the question becomes...

15:11.162 --> 15:13.372
Which floor did he fall from?

15:13.372 --> 15:17.960
Doors were forced open on the fifth.
No workable prints were found.

15:19.837 --> 15:20.880
Okay, Alexx.

15:24.008 --> 15:27.928
Both arms are folded under his body,
like he tried to break his fall.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.639
Impossible to do at five stories.

15:33.017 --> 15:35.436
Look at this, Alexx.
He didn't go easily.

15:35.436 --> 15:37.605
Evidence of a struggle.

15:42.276 --> 15:45.696
His name is Patrick Wakefield,
an account executive at Grove-Turner.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.865
He's also a friend and
colleague of Jay Seaver.

15:47.865 --> 15:51.702
So we've got a girlfriend...
and now a colleague.

15:51.702 --> 15:52.786
Not just any colleague.

15:52.786 --> 15:58.709
Office manager says that
our victim here and Jay Seaver
were up for the same promotion.

16:01.587 --> 16:04.423
Well, it looks like you're gonna
get that promotion, now, Jay.

16:04.423 --> 16:07.259
You think I'm happy about this?
Patrick was a friend.

16:07.259 --> 16:11.221
Big corner office and a
huge expense account.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.266
I did not push Patrick Wakefield
down that elevator shaft.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.434
Who did, Jay?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.941
My life is already in enough danger.

16:21.941 --> 16:23.233
Why is that?

16:25.945 --> 16:27.863
You know but you can't tell me, right?

16:27.863 --> 16:30.324
Hey, I already went to the police.
They made things worse.

16:30.491 --> 16:32.201
So you filed a complaint
against somebody?

16:35.412 --> 16:37.748
Claudia Sanders.

16:37.790 --> 16:41.377
I filed a temporary restraining
order five months ago.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.047
Detective Salas.

16:45.422 --> 16:49.551
Could you please run the name Jay Seaver
through the T.R.O. records, please.

16:49.551 --> 16:54.890
I went on a few dates with her and
I ended it but she wouldn't let it go.

16:54.890 --> 16:58.894
She kept calling me when I was on dates
and she'd show up at the restaurants,
intercept my mail.

16:59.694 --> 17:04.073
I thought it was finally safe
to get out there and start seeing
other people again and...

17:05.366 --> 17:06.492
then this happens.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.035
Thank you.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.037
Yeah.

17:10.037 --> 17:12.832
He filed a T.R.O. on
May 6 of this year.

17:13.249 --> 17:16.460
Court said that Claudia couldn't come
within a hundred yards of him.

17:16.460 --> 17:21.589
I could see a hundred yards,
and she was always there. Always.

17:21.965 --> 17:23.550
Why didn't you report her?

17:24.551 --> 17:26.095
I was afraid I might be next0

17:26.220 --> 17:29.098
I'm afraid she'll go after me
for telling you this much.

17:30.224 --> 17:31.475
So what do I do now?

17:31.726 --> 17:33.728
You do nothing.

17:33.769 --> 17:35.646
You wait for what we do.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.363
Claudia Sanders.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.607
Thank you for comming in.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.785
Detective Salas called.

17:49.785 --> 17:52.955
Said you wanted to talk to me
about Jay Seaver. Is he all right?

17:52.955 --> 17:58.419
Jay is fine. I understand
that you and Jay are quite close.

17:58.419 --> 17:59.211
Very.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.215
He puts ice in his milk.

18:04.759 --> 18:08.554
He squeezes into a 33 waist
when he's busting out of a 34.

18:08.554 --> 18:13.392
He always makes the minimum
payments on his credit cards, breaks
a cell phone once a month.

18:14.769 --> 18:17.521
Familiarity gives birth to intimacy.

18:17.521 --> 18:21.901
Claudia, I am investigating the murders of
Katrina Hannagan and Patrick Wakefield.

18:21.901 --> 18:25.196
I heard. It's just awful.

18:25.738 --> 18:30.201
Jay always knew that Katrina wasn't right
for him, but... he just couldn't shake her.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.204
I've also heard that he took out
a restraining order on you.

18:33.204 --> 18:34.747
Five months ago.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.041
We've been laughing
about it ever since.

18:38.042 --> 18:40.336
Jay's not big on commitment.

18:40.336 --> 18:44.632
He'll be the first one to tell you...
but I love him.

18:44.632 --> 18:46.550
I'd die for him.

18:46.550 --> 18:47.801
But would you kill for him?

18:47.801 --> 18:51.347
Do you have any evidence
to suggest that I would?

18:51.347 --> 18:56.519
We have recovered fibers from Patrick
Wakefield's hand and it's a matter of time

18:56.519 --> 18:57.520
before I match them to someone.

18:58.229 --> 19:01.315
Well, let me know when you do.

19:01.315 --> 19:03.692
You will be first on my list.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.740
Calleigh.

19:10.658 --> 19:12.243
You ever heard of The Whiskey Stop?

19:12.243 --> 19:14.328
Yeah. It used to be
my dad's favorite bar.

19:14.537 --> 19:16.497
Yeah. Well, it still is.

19:16.497 --> 19:18.582
He was there until closing last night.

19:18.582 --> 19:20.042
Apparently a lot of other nights.

19:20.042 --> 19:22.586
Open tab.
Over 800 bucks.

19:24.588 --> 19:26.257
First drink in six months.

19:27.091 --> 19:28.717
Just a second. Tripp.

19:28.926 --> 19:31.220
It's Ryan Wolfe, CSI.

19:31.220 --> 19:34.306
I got something from the soil
on Mr. Duquesne's tires.

19:34.306 --> 19:40.145
It's traces of iron, covered in a thin layer
of calcium oxide, calcium fluoride,
and silicone dioxide.

19:40.145 --> 19:41.772
Looks like weld spatter.

19:41.772 --> 19:43.315
That's something. Thanks.

19:45.025 --> 19:48.195
New kid said he found weld spatter
in your dad's tire tread.

19:48.195 --> 19:50.155
So he was near a construction site.

19:50.364 --> 19:51.282
What's his route?

19:51.282 --> 19:52.449
His route?

19:52.449 --> 19:53.534
His default.

19:53.575 --> 19:54.785
From the bar to his house.

19:54.785 --> 19:56.912
Path of least resistance.

19:56.912 --> 19:59.415
Lessens the chance of getting hurt
and pulled over.

20:02.459 --> 20:06.005
Up 42nd. Coral Way to Granada.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.716
There's a new firehouse
going up, tip of the Gables.

20:08.716 --> 20:12.136
I'll get Wolfe out of the lab,
have him meet me there.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.482
And I thought I drove fast.

20:28.110 --> 20:29.737
This road usually goes through.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.197
It's just closed because
of the construction.

20:33.407 --> 20:34.408
White paint.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.580
Mr. Duquesne had orange paint
on the side of his car.
It's a definite transfer.

20:39.580 --> 20:43.042
And if he were a bit inebriated
and so used to his routine...

20:43.042 --> 20:44.585
He'd ignore the sign.

20:50.257 --> 20:51.383
Arc welding.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.511
Steel beams joined by an
iron-powder electrode.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.723
The process throws
out metal particles.

21:01.977 --> 21:05.439
Tread impressions.
Erratic pattern.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.150
And about ten inches wide.

21:08.150 --> 21:10.194
Both consistent with Duke's vehicle.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.466
I'll call the M.E.s.

21:51.073 --> 21:52.199
- Eric...

21:52.992 --> 21:55.119
The fibers from the elevator shaft.

21:55.202 --> 21:57.955
Yeah, it's an entangled
fiber pulp composite.

21:57.997 --> 21:59.624
It's used in high-strength polyester.

21:59.624 --> 22:01.500
"Synthetic polymer."

22:01.500 --> 22:04.378
I think we're looking at
some sort of uniform.

22:04.378 --> 22:07.798
The button's three-eighths of an inch--
it's from the cuff of a sleeve.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.592
Traces of limonene.

22:09.592 --> 22:12.094
Common ingredient in
leaf-shining spray.

22:12.094 --> 22:14.305
Supposed to keep plants looking clean.

22:14.347 --> 22:17.558
I checked Claudia Sanders' background.

22:18.059 --> 22:18.976
Claudia...

22:19.018 --> 22:22.104
MBA from the business school at UCONN.

22:22.146 --> 22:26.233
But she took a job from Sunside Greenery
this year-- full time.

22:26.275 --> 22:29.195
They do horticultural design,
plant care for office buildings.

22:29.195 --> 22:34.325
Grove-Turner Advertising. She took a job
in Seaver's building to be near him.

22:34.367 --> 22:37.078
I'll cancel my 5:00. We'll be
there for the opening tip.

22:37.119 --> 22:38.371
Yes, center court.

22:48.255 --> 22:51.801
Go back to Sunside Greenery
and see what you can find out.

22:51.801 --> 22:52.802
Nice going.

22:58.432 --> 23:00.684
This is Claudia Sanders' locker right here.

23:00.851 --> 23:02.269
All right. Thanks a lot.

23:02.311 --> 23:03.395
No problem.

23:41.267 --> 23:50.192
The fibers and the button that we found
in the elevator shaftare a match to
the sleeve on your uniform, Claudia.

23:51.360 --> 23:55.823
Trace amounts of limonene in the
fibers also point towards you.

23:55.865 --> 23:59.952
Which means we can place you in
the elevator shaft with Patrick Wakefield.

24:12.172 --> 24:14.842
Patrick was no friend to Jay.

24:14.884 --> 24:15.676
Really?

24:15.718 --> 24:23.017
What friend drinks Manhattans
at Bistro Zinc two nights a week with
the executive director behind your back?

24:25.561 --> 24:27.354
Jay's too trusting.

24:27.354 --> 24:29.064
He always has been.

24:29.106 --> 24:30.566
So you took care of it.

24:32.610 --> 24:35.821
Claudia, you're under arrest for
the murder of Patrick Wakefield.

24:35.946 --> 24:37.907
Now I want to talk about Katrina.

24:38.657 --> 24:41.493
Why don't you direct all of your
questions through my attorney.

24:41.535 --> 24:43.245
He's on his way over here.

24:43.245 --> 24:48.375
The plant job pays you
eight dollars an hour, and yet
you can afford a defense attorney.

24:48.375 --> 24:49.710
Jay hired him.

24:50.794 --> 24:52.421
Jay got you the attorney?

24:52.838 --> 24:56.175
It's what a man does for
the woman he loves.

24:56.884 --> 24:59.178
Jay, tell me this is a joke.

24:59.511 --> 25:02.306
Maybe I'm crazy, but
I feel sorry for her.

25:02.306 --> 25:04.016
So you hire her a private attorney.

25:04.016 --> 25:07.853
There's something wrong with this woman.
She actually thinks she's helping me.

25:07.936 --> 25:10.689
Jay, this is why she stalks
you-- you give her hope.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.068
I feel responsible.

25:15.069 --> 25:17.488
Interesting choice of words.

25:21.241 --> 25:23.786
Would you please take another
look at Katrina here.

25:23.786 --> 25:25.829
Anything specific you have in mind?

25:25.871 --> 25:28.207
Yes, hCG, please.

25:28.248 --> 25:30.209
You thinking inciting incident...?

25:30.250 --> 25:34.922
Alexx, the boyfriend was on the
corporate ladder and Katrina...

25:35.130 --> 25:37.841
Katrina may have been in his way.

25:37.883 --> 25:39.134
I'll get right on it.

25:39.176 --> 25:40.135
Thank you, Alexx.

26:01.031 --> 26:02.157
Calleigh.

26:05.327 --> 26:07.871
We found a body on your route.

26:07.871 --> 26:11.041
Your tire treads were over it
and the skull was crushed.

26:11.083 --> 26:11.959
Oh, Lord.

26:12.459 --> 26:16.797
Dad, now is the time. If you remember
anything at all you've got to tell me.

26:18.257 --> 26:21.718
Everything in me wishes
I did, but I don't.

26:24.763 --> 26:27.349
Sorry. Um, should I...?

26:27.391 --> 26:28.642
No, it's all right.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.311
Dad, this is Ryan.

26:31.395 --> 26:34.606
He's going to process you.
It's standard procedure.

26:35.065 --> 26:37.234
You can change into these.

26:41.446 --> 26:42.239
Ouch !

26:42.322 --> 26:43.490
What is it?

26:56.170 --> 26:57.963
Looks like glass.

26:59.506 --> 27:00.424
Tempered.

27:00.465 --> 27:02.593
Could be auto glass,
but there's no membrane.

27:02.634 --> 27:04.595
Then it's from a side window.

27:04.595 --> 27:07.264
You didn't tell me that there was
any broken glass in the vehicle.

27:07.306 --> 27:09.600
What I told you was,
I wasn't finished.

28:07.574 --> 28:08.575
Carjacking.

28:15.874 --> 28:18.919
So this is the vacation shot
that gives us something to work with.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.089
The tourist was taking
a picture of this girl.

28:24.591 --> 28:27.886
So I'm enlarging the reflection in her eye.

28:28.053 --> 28:30.764
I'm going to slide the image over.

28:30.806 --> 28:34.393
There's our victim-- upper right corner.

28:34.935 --> 28:36.436
Head's arched back.

28:36.478 --> 28:38.522
She was pushed from behind.

28:38.563 --> 28:40.732
Can't see who's doing it.
Just a shoulder.

28:41.817 --> 28:43.151
Look at the shirt.

28:43.652 --> 28:46.947
That's the same color green
as Claudia Sanders' work uniform.

28:47.114 --> 28:49.950
I'm going to check Katrina
Hannagan's clothing for transfer.

28:49.991 --> 28:51.368
This is great. Thanks.

29:30.365 --> 29:35.203
Horatio, ran the hCG Beta
Blood test you asked for.

29:38.123 --> 29:39.833
Katrina Hannagan was pregnant.

29:39.875 --> 29:41.793
Hormone level was 90,000.

29:41.793 --> 29:42.711
How far along?

29:42.752 --> 29:43.962
Seven, eight weeks.

29:44.004 --> 29:45.172
Okay, thank you.

29:46.339 --> 29:47.507
I got it, H.

29:47.716 --> 29:52.095
I found limonene on the back of
Katrina Hannagan's blouse,
just under the right shoulder blade.

29:52.137 --> 29:54.431
It means Claudia Sanders was
behind her on the curb.

30:01.938 --> 30:03.940
Now we can link Claudia to the murder.

30:03.940 --> 30:05.150
You know what else, Eric?

30:05.192 --> 30:07.569
I don't think she acted alone.

30:22.584 --> 30:24.669
He shoots, he scores.

30:31.051 --> 30:36.640
Jay, do you know what the number one
cause death among pregnant women is?

30:37.015 --> 30:38.141
No.

30:38.183 --> 30:39.434
It's homicide.

30:40.101 --> 30:44.606
Homicide at the hands
of the father of the baby.

30:44.689 --> 30:47.692
Is this supposed to mean
something to me?

30:47.734 --> 30:50.111
It should, because Katrina...

30:50.445 --> 30:54.658
was seven weeks pregnant
at the time of her death.

30:54.783 --> 30:57.869
The medical examiner, Jay,
has confirmed this.

30:57.911 --> 31:01.164
So how would you like to give
me a sample of your DNA?

31:01.247 --> 31:02.415
I really wouldn't.

31:02.457 --> 31:03.583
No, of course you wouldn't.

31:03.708 --> 31:08.922
Did you mention to Claudia that you're
latest fling was pregnant,
or did she figure that out on her own?

31:08.922 --> 31:12.008
I can't control what Claudia does.

31:12.050 --> 31:15.929
On the contrary, my friend, you control
everything Claudia does.

31:15.971 --> 31:21.685
She is a love obsessional,
and you give her just enough attention
to keep her interested.

31:21.893 --> 31:29.526
Pregnant girlfriend, office rival,
who else, Jay, has Claudia killed for you?

31:29.567 --> 31:31.486
I am not going to dignify this.

31:31.528 --> 31:32.445
Oh, yes, you are.

31:32.487 --> 31:37.951
I am going to dig up every unsolved case
in the last five months,

31:37.992 --> 31:43.748
and figure out what other problems
Claudia has eliminated for you.

31:52.521 --> 31:55.607
Picked a hell of a case to
get your feet wet on.

31:56.025 --> 31:57.860
Alexx Woods, M.E.

31:58.068 --> 32:00.988
Finished the post on
construction site victim.

32:01.030 --> 32:02.656
A Travis Madison.

32:02.698 --> 32:06.660
He definitely sustained extensive injuries
when he was run over by that car.

32:06.660 --> 32:10.080
But he also suffered from
blunt force trauma to the head.

32:10.456 --> 32:11.749
You got any tool marks?

32:11.790 --> 32:16.879
Yeah, someone hit him with
a cylindrical object--
cracked his skull like an egg.

32:19.757 --> 32:22.301
What killed him, the vehicle,
or the crack to the head?

32:22.342 --> 32:24.636
Histopath says it was a head injury.

32:24.678 --> 32:27.139
He was already dead when
Mr. Duquesne ran him over.

32:27.222 --> 32:29.433
That's my determination.

32:30.809 --> 32:33.145
That means I'm missing a murder weapon.

32:59.038 --> 33:00.206
No hands.

33:00.698 --> 33:02.116
Find anything?

33:02.700 --> 33:04.076
Almost.

33:05.828 --> 33:08.455
See the difference between
the left shoe print and the right?

33:08.539 --> 33:11.458
Look at the pressure releases,
the positioning.

33:12.543 --> 33:15.629
Whoever stood here planted his left foot,
he put some weight on it...

33:15.671 --> 33:16.922
And threw something.

33:22.094 --> 33:24.555
You can read the line of travel
like an arrow.

33:25.973 --> 33:28.308
Where you plant, you point.

33:38.360 --> 33:39.403
What are you doing?

33:39.445 --> 33:40.571
What's that noise?

33:40.863 --> 33:42.239
Is that what I think it is?

33:42.281 --> 33:43.699
Do you want to tell me what
you're doing with that?

33:43.699 --> 33:44.908
Don't come any closer.

33:45.701 --> 33:46.869
What is that?

33:48.746 --> 33:50.164
Roast beef.

33:53.083 --> 33:55.210
Call it cover fire.

33:59.089 --> 34:00.424
What are you doing?!

34:01.049 --> 34:02.176
Ryan!

34:03.218 --> 34:04.219
Ryan?

34:04.678 --> 34:05.929
Ryan!

34:11.935 --> 34:13.937
Looking for this?

34:14.521 --> 34:16.231
Took the back door.

34:22.029 --> 34:25.114
Unsolved homicides linked to
Claudia Sanders.

34:25.157 --> 34:28.911
Solid alibis eliminate her
from four of the five.

34:28.994 --> 34:31.079
This one is suspicious, though.

34:31.121 --> 34:34.081
Martin Perlman stabbed in Miami Beach.

34:34.123 --> 34:37.168
One day after purchasing a new condo.

34:41.297 --> 34:44.051
Yes, but stabbingsare so physical.

34:44.092 --> 34:45.886
Claudia's method is passive.

34:46.136 --> 34:48.847
This Miami Beach address looks familiar.

34:48.972 --> 34:49.889
It should.

34:49.931 --> 34:52.141
That is Jay Seaver's current address.

34:52.684 --> 34:54.811
He lives at the old crime scene?

34:54.811 --> 34:55.938
Let's get over there.

34:56.021 --> 34:57.397
No, we're going to Claudia's.

34:57.439 --> 34:59.358
She's doing the dirty work, thank you.

35:11.912 --> 35:13.830
This room is clear.

35:16.708 --> 35:19.211
Check in there, Eric.

35:50.367 --> 35:52.703
Take a look at this.

35:56.957 --> 35:59.501
So our girl's been doing a
little Dumpster diving?

35:59.543 --> 36:04.464
Yes, this is how Claudia figured out
Katrina was pregnant.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.864
Wait a second.

36:36.037 --> 36:37.706
Box cutter.

36:37.748 --> 36:39.082
Another souvenir?

36:39.458 --> 36:43.211
Yes, but this one is not
for display, Eric.

36:43.336 --> 36:48.633
This is part of a cover-up.
Martin Perlman was stabbed to death,
wasn't he?

36:48.633 --> 36:50.177
Maybe with this.

36:51.052 --> 36:53.180
You're crazy. You know that.

36:53.305 --> 36:54.097
Why?

36:54.139 --> 36:55.849
For taking a little initiative?

36:55.891 --> 36:58.059
You could've been gator
bait on your first day.

36:58.059 --> 36:59.728
I did sacrifice my lunch.

36:59.770 --> 37:01.646
Please, just remember that.

37:04.065 --> 37:05.692
Print on the murder weapon...

37:05.734 --> 37:09.571
Larry Grill, just did time
for assault and battery.
Released last month.

37:09.613 --> 37:12.532
Dad's out of the woods.
My hand-off days are over.

37:14.993 --> 37:16.703
I'm glad it turned out.

37:16.745 --> 37:18.079
Thanks, Ryan.

37:21.208 --> 37:22.876
Kill a guy?

37:23.418 --> 37:24.211
Nah.

37:25.086 --> 37:26.213
Uh-uh. No way.

37:27.172 --> 37:30.342
So your fingerprints just sort of floated
on to the murder weapon?

37:34.054 --> 37:38.725
Not only that, the blood on the receiving
end matches Travis Madison.

37:38.808 --> 37:42.437
The impression left on his
skull matches the weapon.

37:42.437 --> 37:46.858
Blood, prints, tool marks.

37:47.025 --> 37:48.985
You killed him. Admit it.

37:49.986 --> 37:52.155
Travis told me to meet him.

37:52.656 --> 37:54.533
Said he might hook me up.

37:54.908 --> 37:57.244
I'm guessing you're not
talking about women.

37:57.786 --> 37:59.162
About drugs?

38:01.331 --> 38:02.499
Coke.

38:03.124 --> 38:04.751
It's a bad habit, I know.

38:06.044 --> 38:07.712
But his stuff was weak.

38:09.005 --> 38:10.298
You've gotta be kiddin'.

38:10.340 --> 38:12.425
I wanted to get high, not bake a cake.

38:12.467 --> 38:13.635
You try it, you buy it.

38:13.677 --> 38:14.678
No way.

38:15.804 --> 38:17.722
He would've done me first.

38:17.722 --> 38:19.349
Instead, you killed him.

38:19.683 --> 38:21.643
Tried to carjack someone to get away.

38:23.270 --> 38:23.770
Hey!

38:23.853 --> 38:24.771
Get out of the car!

38:26.147 --> 38:26.856
Hey!

38:28.441 --> 38:29.109
Hey!

38:33.446 --> 38:35.657
Hey! Get out of the car!

38:37.659 --> 38:38.868
Get out! Stop!

38:46.376 --> 38:49.045
I hope they saved your
cot at county jail.

38:51.464 --> 38:53.550
That's the Martin Perlman case file.

38:53.633 --> 38:55.593
Yeah, homicide just sent it over.

38:55.635 --> 38:59.055
Place was cleaned up by the time P.D. got there
and the murder weapon was never found.

38:59.097 --> 39:02.225
So that's the knife tip we recovered
from the rib cage, right?

39:02.309 --> 39:04.811
And the box cutter you found
at Claudia Sanders' house.

39:04.811 --> 39:08.189
And we have a perfect match.

39:08.273 --> 39:09.024
- Lieutenant.

39:09.065 --> 39:09.524
- Yeah?

39:09.566 --> 39:11.192
DNA's back, on your weapon.

39:11.192 --> 39:12.736
Blood's from the victim, Perlman.

39:12.736 --> 39:15.947
Also found blood under the
box cutter handle screws.

39:15.989 --> 39:18.074
Different donor and there's
no match for it in CODIS.

39:18.074 --> 39:19.117
No match for CODIS?

39:19.159 --> 39:21.244
Yoow what, let's change that.

39:21.661 --> 39:25.957
That was the first time she took it
upon herself to make someone in my life
disappear.

39:25.957 --> 39:29.586
First time being Martin Perlman?

39:29.627 --> 39:31.755
The guy who outbid me for my condo.

39:31.796 --> 39:33.715
Stabbed him to death.

39:33.757 --> 39:35.425
So this is Claudia then, Jay?

39:35.467 --> 39:37.260
This is all Claudia?

39:37.302 --> 39:38.094
Yeah.

39:38.136 --> 39:40.930
She called me the day
they found his body.

39:40.972 --> 39:43.141
Told me the place was move-in ready.

39:43.183 --> 39:45.602
I was freaked, that she killed him.

39:45.935 --> 39:48.938
But I also have to admit,
part of me was glad.

39:49.397 --> 39:51.900
I really wanted that condo.

39:51.941 --> 39:53.151
I can see that.

39:55.361 --> 39:58.114
Does this seem familiar to you?

40:00.784 --> 40:02.243
Because it should.

40:02.243 --> 40:04.704
You used it to stab Martin.

40:04.746 --> 40:06.706
You killed Martin, not Claudia.

40:06.706 --> 40:11.920
And I know this, Jay, because
you cut yourself in the commission
of the crime.

40:12.045 --> 40:16.466
You waited for my offer, and then
you went a dollar over.

40:16.508 --> 40:18.176
You stole this place from me.

40:18.176 --> 40:20.595
Hey, next time, why don't you
put your money where your mouth is.

40:27.477 --> 40:32.774
See, so it's no longer about your word
against that of an unbalanced woman.

40:34.025 --> 40:36.402
This is called evidence.

40:37.487 --> 40:43.576
She followed me everywhere.

40:43.618 --> 40:48.373
I knew when I looked up,
she would be there...

40:53.920 --> 40:55.797
Claudia.

40:56.297 --> 40:58.424
You need me now.

40:59.050 --> 41:00.510
You go, Jay.

41:00.552 --> 41:02.011
I'll clean this up.

41:02.470 --> 41:08.226
Don't worry, I'll always look out
for you. I promise.

41:19.445 --> 41:23.157
Claudia has a defense.

41:23.199 --> 41:25.243
Claudia is insane.

41:25.743 --> 41:30.623
You are just a liar, and now a killer.

41:30.665 --> 41:34.877
For you, that adds up to life times.

41:34.919 --> 41:37.130
one...

41:37.380 --> 41:39.132
two...

41:39.590 --> 41:41.384
three.

42:11.164 --> 42:12.165
Thank you.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.500
Calleigh.

42:15.335 --> 42:20.548
Boy, I feel like I just got a
get out of jail free card.

42:20.757 --> 42:23.134
It's not free this time, dad.

42:24.093 --> 42:25.928
Gimme your car keys.

42:26.512 --> 42:28.848
My car keys? What for?

42:28.890 --> 42:32.685
Maybe I can't keep you from drinking,
but I can keep you from driving.

42:43.362 --> 42:46.991
I'll take you home, but I want to say
good night to somebody first.

42:47.533 --> 42:48.367
Sure

42:58.669 --> 43:00.171
How we doing?

43:00.963 --> 43:02.256
Better.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.801
Better, but not great.

43:06.427 --> 43:07.887
No, not great.

43:11.182 --> 43:17.355
You know, they say that one day at a time
works both ways.

43:18.481 --> 43:20.483
I'll remember that.

43:20.566 --> 43:21.192
Okay.

43:21.692 --> 43:23.236
How did Wolfe do?

43:23.653 --> 43:25.613
Surprisingly good.

43:26.823 --> 43:28.741
But you knew that, didn't you?

43:28.825 --> 43:30.409
It's in his blood.

43:31.494 --> 43:32.787
Good night.
