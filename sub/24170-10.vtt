WEBVTT

00:00.707 --> 00:02.500
Previously on Station 19.

00:02.500 --> 00:04.673
Captains have to balance what's
moral and what's practical.

00:04.673 --> 00:07.272
And while I would never want
to squash another woman to win, I will

00:07.300 --> 00:08.844
You punched the wrong code
into the security system,

00:08.879 --> 00:10.479
and it automatically shut all the doors.

00:10.513 --> 00:11.813
I don't know what got you so distracted

00:11.848 --> 00:12.781
that you made a mistake like that,

00:12.815 --> 00:14.549
- but next time...
- There won't be a next time.

00:14.584 --> 00:16.952
If we're gonna try this,
I need to go slow.

00:16.986 --> 00:18.119
I think I'm scared of fire.

00:18.154 --> 00:19.221
I stop. I freeze up.

00:19.255 --> 00:20.856
- Okay. I can get to it.
- Maya...

00:20.890 --> 00:22.023
Maya!

00:22.058 --> 00:23.225
Why did you do that?

00:23.259 --> 00:24.226
Huh?

00:24.260 --> 00:25.393
I didn't support you

00:25.428 --> 00:27.796
or Jack for the Captain position.

00:31.868 --> 00:33.802
<i>People call us heroes.</i>

00:36.272 --> 00:38.173
But if you ask any firefighter,

00:38.207 --> 00:41.409
<i>we're the first to say,
"No, we're not heroes.</i>

00:41.444 --> 00:45.247
<i>We're not superhuman.
We're just regular people.</i>

00:45.281 --> 00:47.883
<i>We have flaws. We have fears.</i>

00:47.917 --> 00:52.888
<i>We just show up every day
and do our job. That's it."</i>

00:52.922 --> 00:54.656
<i>It doesn't make us heroes.</i>

00:54.690 --> 00:56.658
Andy, it's too much.
You can't make it to her.

00:56.692 --> 00:58.560
- The hell I can't.
- Andy, no!

01:02.098 --> 01:04.566
<i>Somebody has to.</i>

01:08.371 --> 01:12.107
- Ohh. Mnh.
- You are a terrible influence.

01:12.141 --> 01:13.302
I told you,

01:13.327 --> 01:15.080
- I don't usually sleep over.
- Mnh.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.679
Dearborn?

01:17.713 --> 01:18.880
Was she there when we got in last night?

01:18.915 --> 01:20.448
Why are you with her?

01:20.483 --> 01:22.684
It was Wednesday. I treat myself
to self-care on Wednesdays,

01:22.718 --> 01:24.686
usually in the form of a one-night stand.

01:24.720 --> 01:25.720
Has anyone seen my pants?

01:25.755 --> 01:28.256
Why her? Dearborn, Station 12.

01:28.291 --> 01:30.058
Yeah, we weren't really focused on names.

01:30.092 --> 01:33.028
What she means is I kicked
her ass in the Incinerator.

01:33.062 --> 01:34.095
Big day today, Herr.

01:34.130 --> 01:36.097
Of course, it's probably bigger
for you than me.

01:36.132 --> 01:38.266
You got a lot more to make up
for in your Ripley sit-down.

01:38.301 --> 01:40.869
For me, it's kind of just
a matter of red tape

01:40.903 --> 01:41.937
since he loves me.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.706
I'm very lovable.

01:44.740 --> 01:47.943
Especially when I do that one
thing with my other thing...

01:47.977 --> 01:50.645
Okay, Wednesday, it's Thursday now.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.547
Time to go.

02:00.589 --> 02:03.425
Okay. Yep.

02:04.794 --> 02:07.295
I swear, I had no idea.

02:07.330 --> 02:08.997
Good, 'cause, otherwise,
you might have just ruined

02:09.031 --> 02:10.298
my last day as captain.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.667
Your last day officially
not getting the title.

02:12.702 --> 02:15.236
Which we both know
that probably won't happen

02:15.271 --> 02:17.005
with what my dad said to Ripley.

02:17.039 --> 02:19.774
What do you need right now?
A pep talk? No talk?

02:19.809 --> 02:20.775
I'm here for either. You tell me.

02:20.810 --> 02:23.812
I just want to enjoy what I have
while I have it.

02:23.846 --> 02:24.946
Dearborn-free.

02:24.981 --> 02:28.416
See, I don't think you get
an opinion on who I bring home

02:28.451 --> 02:30.752
when you're crashing on my couch.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

02:40.029 --> 02:42.864
Hey, why is Ripley holding
all the interviews

02:42.898 --> 02:44.699
with the captain wannabes here?

02:44.734 --> 02:46.368
I don't like the idea
of all the other candidates

02:46.402 --> 02:48.803
being in our space,
all up in our business.

02:48.838 --> 02:49.804
Me either.

02:49.839 --> 02:51.840
You didn't seem to mind
too much last night.

02:51.874 --> 02:54.109
I told you, I didn't know who she was!

02:54.143 --> 02:55.710
Wait. Hang on. Did I just miss something?

02:55.745 --> 02:56.778
What did I just miss?

02:56.812 --> 02:58.246
Okay. What are you gonna say
in your meeting today,

02:58.280 --> 02:59.714
if you've decided
you've already lost this thing?

02:59.749 --> 03:01.850
What? No!

03:01.884 --> 03:03.852
No, no, no. Wrong attitude.
Don't think that.

03:03.886 --> 03:06.488
I'm just gonna
be true to myself, all right?

03:06.522 --> 03:08.656
- That's all I can do.
- Okay, hey.

03:08.691 --> 03:11.159
I am sensing some resignation
here, and I don't like it.

03:11.193 --> 03:12.961
The Incinerator may have been bad,

03:12.995 --> 03:15.163
but that doesn't mean you're
completely out of the running.

03:15.197 --> 03:16.289
Why would you think that way?

03:16.324 --> 03:19.200
You know, just a hunch, I guess.

03:21.437 --> 03:23.338
Well, we might've bought the whole store.

03:23.372 --> 03:24.672
That's what I get for going shopping

03:24.707 --> 03:25.874
with a professional chef.

03:25.908 --> 03:28.243
Grant, did you wake up at his place?

03:28.277 --> 03:29.377
'Cause, if so, that is huge.

03:29.412 --> 03:30.412
He never lets anybody sleep over.

03:30.446 --> 03:32.814
- Okay, this was on his way to work...
- I... Oh.

03:32.848 --> 03:35.717
...and I needed the extra hands,
and that's it.

03:35.751 --> 03:37.185
Okay, that's it?

03:37.219 --> 03:38.753
That's it.

03:38.788 --> 03:40.722
Loving this view.

03:40.756 --> 03:42.724
Listen, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about

03:42.758 --> 03:44.159
- when you get a minute.
- Like what?

03:44.193 --> 03:47.695
Well, I think it's great.
And I am anxiously waiting

03:47.730 --> 03:50.098
for my invitation to come be
a third wheel

03:50.132 --> 03:52.600
at any one of your gourmet-cooked meals.

03:52.635 --> 03:54.069
Are we still on for next week?

03:54.103 --> 03:56.071
Next week? What's next week?

03:56.105 --> 03:58.773
Maya's trying to convince me
and Vic to try aerial yoga.

03:58.808 --> 04:01.776
- Ugh.
- You and... oh, okay.

04:01.811 --> 04:04.112
You guys are making plans. That's cool.

04:04.146 --> 04:06.881
That's, uh, totally
not weird and strange.

04:06.916 --> 04:10.785
Okay, time to go. I will walk you out.

04:10.820 --> 04:12.821
Ah, okay.

04:13.823 --> 04:14.889
Bye.

04:16.591 --> 04:17.791
You just got weird.

04:17.827 --> 04:18.927
What? No.

04:18.961 --> 04:21.196
Do you not want me talking to
your friends or something?

04:21.230 --> 04:23.031
I ju... I...

04:23.065 --> 04:26.234
I guess I didn't realize that
you already <i>were</i> talking to them

04:26.268 --> 04:28.136
and making plans with them.

04:28.170 --> 04:29.737
Is that a problem?

04:29.772 --> 04:31.806
I told you, if you need things
to go more slowly,

04:31.841 --> 04:33.041
all you have to do is say it.

04:33.075 --> 04:34.409
Yeah, no, I-I know.

04:34.443 --> 04:36.644
I don't want to play games.
Just be honest.

04:36.679 --> 04:37.779
I'd respect that.

04:37.813 --> 04:41.316
What I don't respect is you
not actually talking to me.

04:41.350 --> 04:43.318
I'm looking for something real.

04:43.352 --> 04:45.987
And it's fine if
you're not that guy, really.

04:46.021 --> 04:49.272
I'm not expecting everything all at once.

04:49.859 --> 04:52.192
But I do expect respect.

04:52.995 --> 04:54.596
Hey. Hey, Grant...

04:54.630 --> 04:55.930
I'll see myself out.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.067
- ...and me.
- Yeah.

04:59.101 --> 05:00.902
Hey. Hey. How you doing, man?

05:00.936 --> 05:03.805
The thing is, they asked me
to bring breakfast tacos

05:03.839 --> 05:04.939
from Madre's.

05:04.974 --> 05:07.008
If I walk in there empty-handed,
I'll never live it down.

05:07.042 --> 05:08.743
Well, they can't expect you
to move mountains

05:08.777 --> 05:10.645
if the mountains are closed
for renovations.

05:10.679 --> 05:12.747
Look, I am the rookie.

05:12.781 --> 05:14.482
It's my job to do this stuff.

05:14.517 --> 05:16.651
Okay, you may be the rookie,

05:16.685 --> 05:21.456
but you are also a genuine,
certified, accomplished surgeon

05:21.490 --> 05:22.924
who already paid his dues.

05:22.958 --> 05:24.492
And they should appreciate that,

05:24.527 --> 05:26.995
not waste your time sending you
on impossible errands.

05:27.029 --> 05:29.931
You are very sexy when
you're defending my honor.

05:29.965 --> 05:32.300
Oh, I'm sexy all the damn time.

05:32.334 --> 05:34.969
And not too afraid to go tell your boss

05:35.004 --> 05:37.205
nobody treats my husband like this.

05:37.239 --> 05:40.341
N-No. N-No. No, Miranda!

05:40.376 --> 05:42.075
Herrera!

05:43.012 --> 05:44.312
He's all yours.

05:44.346 --> 05:46.514
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.

05:46.549 --> 05:48.449
I wasn't able to get
the tacos that you wanted.

05:48.484 --> 05:49.817
Yeah, we know.

05:49.852 --> 05:51.553
That place has been closed for a month.

05:51.587 --> 05:54.956
We just wanted to make sure
that you were late.

05:59.862 --> 06:00.995
Oh.

06:01.030 --> 06:02.797
Okay, what's happening?

06:02.831 --> 06:07.468
As of last week, you have
officially run into 50 fires.

06:07.503 --> 06:12.173
And you have run out of 50 fires
not dead, so congrats.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.474
I, for sure, thought that you'd be back

06:13.509 --> 06:15.910
at your cushy little surgery gig by now.

06:17.112 --> 06:21.316
Well, either that or crispy fried.

06:21.350 --> 06:22.383
I'm sorry.

06:22.418 --> 06:24.352
50 fires is a big rite of passage.

06:24.386 --> 06:25.553
Congratulations, Warren.

06:25.588 --> 06:28.690
I mean, I'd seen, like, 50 fires
in probably half the time.

06:29.692 --> 06:30.957
Well, open it already!

06:34.129 --> 06:38.048
Keys to the Aid Car.
You get to drive it now.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.102
I get to drive?

06:41.136 --> 06:42.503
<i>I</i> get to drive.

06:42.538 --> 06:43.738
- Boom!
- Whoa.

06:43.772 --> 06:45.573
No, see, rookies don't get to drive.

06:45.608 --> 06:47.609
- New guys don't drive.
- You...

06:47.643 --> 06:50.011
I drive now. Me.

06:50.045 --> 06:51.045
And I eat.

06:53.716 --> 06:56.584
Will look pretty good behind
the wheel, don't you think?

06:56.619 --> 06:58.786
Uh, right now,
you're acting like a grown man

06:58.821 --> 07:01.422
excited about a big toy.

07:01.457 --> 07:02.957
No speeding.

07:02.992 --> 07:04.959
I'm so proud of you.

07:04.994 --> 07:07.462
Whoa!

07:07.496 --> 07:10.098
And I wish I could stay, but,
uh, I got to go cut people open.

07:11.634 --> 07:14.569
Oh, uh, am I gonna see you
for your appointment later?

07:14.603 --> 07:15.870
It's just the... the usual stuff,

07:15.904 --> 07:16.930
shouldn't take too long.

07:16.965 --> 07:18.380
I'll be there.

07:18.941 --> 07:22.277
Okay, how did you all even know
that I passed my driving test?

07:22.311 --> 07:24.612
We're family. We keep track
of stuff like that.

07:24.647 --> 07:27.782
Also, Vic might've figured out

07:27.816 --> 07:29.584
how to crack your e-mail password.

07:29.618 --> 07:31.486
It's "Hot Hot Miranda,"
if anyone's curious.

07:32.921 --> 07:34.455
I'll be changing that today.

07:34.490 --> 07:36.924
Can you pass the bacon?

07:36.959 --> 07:38.092
All right.

07:42.831 --> 07:44.599
Andrea?

07:44.633 --> 07:46.501
Andrea.

07:46.535 --> 07:47.669
Andrea, we need to talk.

07:47.703 --> 07:48.736
I'm not ready yet.

07:48.771 --> 07:50.738
I'll wind up saying something
I don't mean to say.

07:50.773 --> 07:51.773
But I hope you understand I'm...

07:51.807 --> 07:52.907
I wasn't trying to hurt you
by talking to Ripley.

07:52.941 --> 07:55.777
You know, you're entitled
to your opinion about me.

07:55.811 --> 07:58.246
But the fact that you tanked Jack, too...

07:58.280 --> 08:01.983
you'd leave the entire station
open for an outsider

08:02.017 --> 08:04.085
- to come in and take over...
- It could be a good thing.

08:04.119 --> 08:07.488
...instead of having
a little faith in our team...

08:07.523 --> 08:08.856
the team <i>you</i> built...

08:08.891 --> 08:11.693
and some trust that
we could make it work.

08:11.727 --> 08:16.197
I expected you to believe
in us as our captain.

08:16.231 --> 08:19.867
And as my dad...

08:22.004 --> 08:23.805
I guess I just thought that...

08:27.910 --> 08:31.620
I'd hoped you had faith in me, too.

08:32.081 --> 08:34.148
I'm sorry, Andrea. I know you're angry.

08:34.183 --> 08:35.683
You have every right to be.

08:35.717 --> 08:38.352
Yeah, but you're not sorry
about what you said to Ripley.

08:41.056 --> 08:42.823
- Andrea...
- That's what I thought.

09:05.114 --> 09:07.749
Can't believe the captain's race
is almost over.

09:07.783 --> 09:10.084
It's kind of crazy.

09:10.119 --> 09:13.354
Not even sure of what I'll say
to Ripley when I'm in there.

09:13.389 --> 09:15.189
I think I stood a better chance
with Frankel.

09:23.265 --> 09:25.166
Skyscraper fire downtown.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.401
Sweet!

09:26.435 --> 09:28.035
Oh, hey, Herrera.

09:28.070 --> 09:29.637
Don't be nervous. Warmed him up for you.

09:31.407 --> 09:32.407
Sir?

09:32.441 --> 09:33.608
Panel interviews are postponed

09:33.642 --> 09:34.666
until further notice.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.210
I'm needed at this skyscraper fire.

09:36.245 --> 09:37.078
Sorry, guys.

09:37.112 --> 09:38.813
- Yes, sir.
- Of course.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.856
Andy.

09:42.384 --> 09:44.585
So you know, if I don't get captain,

09:44.620 --> 09:45.953
I'm putting in for a transfer.

09:45.988 --> 09:48.589
A transfer? What? Why?

09:48.624 --> 09:50.558
I mean, it's pretty simple.

09:50.592 --> 09:51.832
I got some regrets about things

09:51.857 --> 09:53.394
- that have happened and...
- Regrets?

09:53.429 --> 09:55.563
...and I'd rather start fresh...

09:57.232 --> 09:58.915
...somewhere else.

09:59.735 --> 10:02.236
You know, I think
it'd be better all around.

10:09.578 --> 10:17.107
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

10:20.913 --> 10:22.147
- Hey.
- What's up?

10:22.181 --> 10:24.616
Can't believe we haven't been
called on that skyscraper yet.

10:24.650 --> 10:25.851
I hate the waiting.

10:25.885 --> 10:28.220
Yeah, while we're waiting, um...

10:28.254 --> 10:30.122
This is weirdly hard.

10:30.156 --> 10:31.957
It's the worst.

10:31.991 --> 10:34.226
We have to sit here waiting
until Ripley pulls the trigger.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.194
We should just
get it over with, you know?

10:36.229 --> 10:39.698
You're my guy. Or you used to be my guy.

10:39.732 --> 10:41.733
And then we sort of stopped hanging out.

10:41.768 --> 10:43.335
And then, we stopped talking.

10:43.369 --> 10:45.237
And I-I just figured
that you were too busy,

10:45.271 --> 10:47.205
and you <i>were</i> too busy with Herrera.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.474
And now... it's weird.

10:49.509 --> 10:50.742
And talking to you is weird.

10:50.777 --> 10:52.744
And... And it never used to be weird.

10:52.779 --> 10:53.612
Talk to me about what?

10:53.646 --> 10:56.948
Hey. Group meeting in the barn, guys.

10:58.184 --> 11:00.310
It's fine. It can wait.

11:00.953 --> 11:03.088
Let's do this thing!

11:03.122 --> 11:05.056
Two additional units requested.

11:05.091 --> 11:06.725
<i>Partial evacuation currently in progress.</i>

11:06.759 --> 11:08.427
All right, check these carefully.

11:08.461 --> 11:10.262
It's been a while since we
needed to pull this many hoses.

11:10.296 --> 11:11.897
Radios are tuned in. Alerts are on.

11:11.931 --> 11:13.231
Only a matter of time
till they call us in.

11:13.266 --> 11:16.501
<i>Looks like the structural fire
originated on the 24th floor.</i>

11:16.536 --> 11:19.404
25th is currently 0% contained. <i>Over.</i>

11:19.439 --> 11:20.739
0%? Still?

11:20.773 --> 11:21.873
Why aren't they calling us in now?

11:21.908 --> 11:22.941
I wish they would.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.509
I am ready to get in there
and tackle this monster.

11:24.544 --> 11:25.544
Switch it up!

11:25.578 --> 11:28.280
You know, it's good to get
in there later, too.

11:28.314 --> 11:30.081
A lot of other units
in there already, so...

11:30.116 --> 11:32.117
Warren, what makes a high-rise
like this different

11:32.151 --> 11:33.251
from other structure fires?

11:33.286 --> 11:35.287
The roof can't be vented.

11:35.321 --> 11:37.456
Internal containment's
the name of the game.

11:39.225 --> 11:41.426
Using fire doors, concentrated wet-downs,

11:41.461 --> 11:43.094
just trying to keep the blaze
as small as we can,

11:43.129 --> 11:44.463
contain it to the floor.

11:44.497 --> 11:46.431
We'll all need to remember,
conserve energy.

11:46.466 --> 11:49.201
In a building this tall, you can
usually use the elevators

11:49.235 --> 11:51.269
if you don't jump the fire line.

11:51.304 --> 11:52.637
Fire in the elevator shaft

11:52.672 --> 11:54.739
opens us up to
a whole new world of problems.

11:54.774 --> 11:56.374
- Great.
- Any of us drop in there,

11:56.409 --> 11:59.444
you know the rules...
we save firefighter lives first.

11:59.479 --> 12:01.746
All right, so take breaks
if you need them

12:01.781 --> 12:04.449
or you might contribute to the
problem instead of the solution.

12:04.484 --> 12:06.418
Nobody likes a hero. Understood?

12:06.452 --> 12:07.652
- Got it.
- Understood!

12:07.687 --> 12:09.654
<i>Chief's calling Station 71 in, copy.</i>

12:09.689 --> 12:12.057
Oh, I just want to get in there!

12:12.091 --> 12:13.892
<i>The firefighters are
currently battling the fire</i>

12:13.926 --> 12:17.162
<i>- on floors 24...
- I just want to get in there!</i>

12:17.196 --> 12:18.763
Well, maybe they won't need us.

12:18.798 --> 12:20.298
I mean, if we never get called in,

12:20.333 --> 12:21.967
it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world.

12:22.001 --> 12:22.968
It's worse than the worst.

12:23.002 --> 12:25.403
That would kill my soul.

12:25.438 --> 12:27.105
<i>We have four companies responding</i>

12:27.139 --> 12:28.507
<i>and ready to call in more
if we need them.</i>

12:28.541 --> 12:30.308
<i>And I can report there have
been no deaths.</i>

12:30.343 --> 12:33.178
Jack said if he doesn't make
captain, he's transferring.

12:33.212 --> 12:34.779
- By choice?
- Why would anyone leave 19?

12:34.814 --> 12:36.748
He thinks it'll be easier.

12:36.782 --> 12:40.185
He says he has regrets.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.920
He'll regret starting over from scratch

12:41.954 --> 12:43.788
at some lame, brand-new station

12:43.823 --> 12:45.023
with lame, brand-new people.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.626
And guess who's not lame? Us.

12:49.695 --> 12:53.164
I never wanted any of this.
To make him leave?

12:53.199 --> 12:55.643
I mean, I can't even imagine
this place without him.

12:55.677 --> 12:57.469
I-I don't really want to.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.274
If he leaves, can I have his locker?

13:02.308 --> 13:03.441
His boots are super stinky.

13:08.681 --> 13:12.217
Well, we should go get a power nap.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.819
Rest while we can before they call us in.

13:14.854 --> 13:17.355
- Yeah, sure.
- Absolutely.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.124
It's so hard to look away, though.

13:19.158 --> 13:20.325
Can we come over here <i>real quick</i>

13:20.359 --> 13:21.459
<i>- and ask a few questions?
- Yes.</i>

13:21.494 --> 13:23.361
- Five more minutes.
- Yes. Thank you.

13:26.399 --> 13:28.567
You realize it doesn't
have racing stripes?

13:28.601 --> 13:30.869
Oh, I bet you were just as excited

13:30.903 --> 13:32.404
when you got your first turn.

13:32.438 --> 13:33.838
I don't know if I was <i>this</i> excited.

13:36.008 --> 13:37.842
You know, the last time
I remember feeling like this

13:37.877 --> 13:40.412
was my first solo surgery.

13:40.446 --> 13:41.786
I mean, it was a routine tonsillectomy,

13:41.821 --> 13:44.583
but it was a sign that
I was doing something right.

13:44.617 --> 13:46.484
I was moving forward.

13:46.519 --> 13:48.019
No turning back after that.

13:49.889 --> 13:53.191
Oh, I can't wait to drive my
first patient to the hospital.

13:54.026 --> 13:57.262
Miranda watching me pull up
into the breezeway

13:57.296 --> 13:59.264
with my patient that I drove.

14:00.566 --> 14:01.666
I just hope it's something good,

14:01.701 --> 14:03.101
you know, like a... like a triple-A.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.604
Something that she could...
she'd really enjoy.

14:05.638 --> 14:06.838
You're lucky...

14:06.872 --> 14:09.841
having that person to share things with.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.543
Even if the things you're sharing

14:11.577 --> 14:13.178
are emergent abdominal surgeries.

14:13.212 --> 14:14.879
You've got that person. You've got Grant.

14:14.914 --> 14:16.514
Yeah, I think I'm messing that up.

14:18.651 --> 14:21.286
He kind of snapped at me earlier,

14:21.320 --> 14:22.690
and he was right.

14:22.724 --> 14:24.456
I was acting weird.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.224
I don't know, man. It's hard for me.

14:26.258 --> 14:28.760
It's complicated.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.530
Look, it... it doesn't have to be.

14:32.565 --> 14:34.466
Look, e-either he's the guy

14:34.500 --> 14:36.534
that you want to share everything with,

14:36.569 --> 14:37.860
or he's not.

14:39.105 --> 14:41.706
Doesn't have to be
any more complicated than that.

14:45.511 --> 14:48.079
I think it's complicated
for me because...

14:49.148 --> 14:52.283
I haven't felt the way he makes me feel

14:52.318 --> 14:53.585
in a long time.

14:53.619 --> 14:56.921
Oh.

14:56.956 --> 14:58.623
So tell him.

14:58.658 --> 15:00.992
- Just like that.
- Yes, just like that.

15:01.676 --> 15:04.396
W-We go to this call,
I drive this damn rig,

15:04.430 --> 15:07.565
we have a good freaking day,
and then you tell him.

15:11.137 --> 15:12.303
It does sound like a pretty good day.

15:12.338 --> 15:14.606
Oh, it is a very good day, Montgomery.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.607
We are claiming it!

15:17.309 --> 15:19.477
<i>Station 19, response.</i>

15:19.512 --> 15:21.613
Oh! <i>Structural fire.</i>

15:21.647 --> 15:23.181
<i>Full response needed.</i>

15:31.824 --> 15:33.191
This is it. It's time.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.959
Is it time?

15:34.994 --> 15:36.661
Let's go have our very good day.

15:36.696 --> 15:39.698
This is a damn good day!

15:47.540 --> 15:48.592
Okay, here's what we know.

15:48.627 --> 15:50.608
Chief Ripley's operating from Base Camp

15:50.643 --> 15:52.277
three floors below the fire.

15:52.311 --> 15:54.312
Multiple companies have already
been hitting this thing

15:54.346 --> 15:56.681
since morning...
it's still only 10% contained.

15:56.716 --> 15:58.516
Get in there. Fight smart and fight safe.

15:58.551 --> 16:01.519
But, mostly, let's just fight
this damn thing.

16:09.862 --> 16:11.730
Ryan, what are you doing here?

16:11.764 --> 16:13.698
You guys were overwhelmed
with evacuations.

16:13.733 --> 16:15.900
Some of us decided to come down,
pitch in where we can.

16:15.935 --> 16:18.970
Which we appreciate. But you're
almost tagged out, all right?

16:19.004 --> 16:20.872
Listen up! I don't want anyone exposed

16:20.906 --> 16:21.941
to this smoke and debris

16:21.966 --> 16:23.408
- for too long, understood?
- Okay?

16:23.442 --> 16:26.377
Station 19, excellent response time.

16:26.412 --> 16:28.680
Now, containment's up to 15%,
but it's slow going.

16:28.714 --> 16:31.216
I need most of you
on the active fire, Floor 25,

16:31.250 --> 16:32.684
to relieve Company 7.

16:32.718 --> 16:34.152
We could use your Aid Car team
down here on triage.

16:34.186 --> 16:35.286
- No problem.
- You got it.

16:35.321 --> 16:37.422
And I need two of you
on crowd control on Floor 28.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.724
We're still holding about 100 civilians.

16:39.759 --> 16:41.526
As you know, it's safer to keep
them above the fire line.

16:41.560 --> 16:42.527
Hughes and I will take 28.

16:42.561 --> 16:44.162
- Thank you.
- What? Really?

16:44.196 --> 16:45.697
You've been waiting all day
to go after this thing.

16:45.731 --> 16:47.265
Nah, go shine for Ripley.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.900
Hughes and I can handle the civies.

16:48.934 --> 16:51.936
All right, 19.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

16:51.971 --> 16:53.671
Thank you. Hey, right behind you.

16:53.706 --> 16:55.740
Wait up. Ooh, you look beat.

16:55.775 --> 16:57.041
Don't you want to take a break?

16:57.076 --> 16:58.576
And let you have all the fun?

16:58.611 --> 17:00.678
The chief watching? Not a chance.

17:00.713 --> 17:01.746
Race ya!

17:04.916 --> 17:06.584
Told ya. Tons of fun. Whoo-hoo!

17:06.618 --> 17:08.553
Easy, Dearborn. It's not a drill.

17:08.587 --> 17:09.686
Digging her energy.

17:09.722 --> 17:10.855
I could do without it.

17:10.890 --> 17:12.056
Station 7, we're relieving you.

17:12.090 --> 17:15.393
Copy that. Careful in here.
Debris is falling pretty bad.

17:15.426 --> 17:17.628
All right, let's keep it
slow and steady, guys.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.696
I have been there...
like, all day, been there.

17:19.732 --> 17:20.765
Slow and steady's all we've been doing.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.467
- Do you think we should get in there?
- I mean, I...

17:22.501 --> 17:25.470
Yeah, and make some headway.
Go big or go home, right?

17:25.503 --> 17:26.637
There's a break in the fire.

17:26.673 --> 17:28.321
- Yeah, I see it.
- It's not very big.

17:28.356 --> 17:29.403
Big enough.

17:29.437 --> 17:30.441
If I can get to a fire door,

17:30.476 --> 17:32.811
that may give us a better handle
over this part of the fire.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.712
Closing the fire door would
probably help, but...

17:34.747 --> 17:36.281
Then we're agreed! But it's too risky!

17:36.315 --> 17:37.949
Damn it, Dearborn!

17:39.251 --> 17:42.287
Whoa-oh! She made it!

17:42.321 --> 17:44.722
Aah!

17:44.757 --> 17:46.491
Dearborn, are you okay?

17:48.828 --> 17:50.895
Dearborn, repeat. Confirm you're okay.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.230
The steel from the building

17:52.264 --> 17:53.298
could be interfering with the radios.

17:53.332 --> 17:54.465
She may not be able to hear you.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.633
She might be hurt. I got to go in.

17:55.668 --> 17:57.669
Let me hook up our hose lines first.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.737
Andy, it's too much.
You can't make it to her.

18:06.445 --> 18:07.779
The hell I can't.

18:07.813 --> 18:09.280
Andy, no!

18:23.298 --> 18:24.898
I almost closed the fire door.

18:24.933 --> 18:26.667
Stupid vent got in the way.

18:26.701 --> 18:28.335
Don't worry, I got you.

18:28.369 --> 18:31.074
Oh, you need more hands, better leverage.

18:31.109 --> 18:32.539
Hang on.

18:36.611 --> 18:38.712
Fire's getting closer.

18:42.474 --> 18:43.750
What the hell is that?

18:43.785 --> 18:47.454
It's an extinguisher sphere,
filled with CO2.

18:48.323 --> 18:49.623
Whoa.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.397
Herrera, you okay?

18:57.432 --> 18:58.788
Over here!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.167
Help me lift this thing
so I can pull her out.

19:03.518 --> 19:06.387
That smoke ball thingy...
oh, it's awesome!

19:07.375 --> 19:09.776
So was that throw, Herrera!

19:09.811 --> 19:11.812
When I'm running 19,

19:11.846 --> 19:14.248
I am making you pitcher
of the softball team.

19:14.282 --> 19:16.223
Yeah, a simple "thank you" would be fine.

19:19.020 --> 19:21.421
It looks like that sphere gave
us a major hold on the fire.

19:21.456 --> 19:22.723
There's still fire
in the ceiling, though.

19:22.757 --> 19:23.690
Could be spreading out.

19:23.725 --> 19:25.626
Then you and Miller
should go check on 26.

19:28.263 --> 19:29.830
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You can't put weight on it.

19:29.864 --> 19:32.399
- It's okay to step out.
- Oh, no. No way.

19:32.433 --> 19:34.234
I'm not stepping out
with Ripley downstairs

19:34.269 --> 19:35.335
weighing my every move.

19:35.370 --> 19:36.937
I told you...

19:38.840 --> 19:41.842
This is Herrera. I've got
an injured firefighter on 25.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.944
We're coming down.
Send two more to replace us.

19:43.978 --> 19:45.012
<i>Copy that, Herrera.</i>

19:45.046 --> 19:46.680
You are so loving this.

19:46.714 --> 19:47.848
A little bit.

19:50.051 --> 19:51.685
- Oh, hello. Hi.
- Hi.

19:51.719 --> 19:52.753
Um, I'm Molly.

19:52.787 --> 19:55.355
I'm the fire evacuation
coordinator for my office.

19:55.390 --> 19:58.192
Station 19. Um...

19:58.226 --> 20:00.928
Ooh, you guys are way outside
of the district.

20:00.962 --> 20:02.763
So this must be a pretty big fire then

20:02.797 --> 20:04.164
if they had to call you guys in.

20:04.199 --> 20:05.666
Molly, I know it feels counterintuitive

20:05.700 --> 20:07.201
to stay up here right now.

20:07.235 --> 20:09.803
"Panic stampede running past
floors of fire and smoke

20:09.837 --> 20:11.705
is likely to cause
more injuries than good.

20:11.739 --> 20:14.841
If instructed, gather your floor
in a common space

20:14.876 --> 20:17.741
until the fire department
gives the all-clear."

20:18.646 --> 20:22.216
Oh, see, it's in Section 3
of my coordinator manual.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.183
She's a mini Herrera.

20:23.218 --> 20:24.184
Oh, shoot!

20:24.219 --> 20:27.621
Last names "G" through "M,"

20:27.655 --> 20:29.837
it's time for your restroom break.

20:30.558 --> 20:32.793
I-I've got a list
of everyone on this floor.

20:32.827 --> 20:34.895
And I also have a first aid kit.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.029
Whatever you need, I'm... I'm here.

20:36.064 --> 20:37.231
Okay. Well, we need to do
a sweep and check for smoke.

20:37.265 --> 20:40.801
So you think you can cover
the stairwell for a little bit?

20:40.835 --> 20:42.869
Yes. On it.

20:46.007 --> 20:48.272
Make sure you get this X-rayed.

20:49.444 --> 20:50.744
Tell me what's going on.

20:50.778 --> 20:52.512
I was on the floor when the fire started.

20:52.547 --> 20:55.142
Ohh. Tried to make a run for it
before I got trapped.

20:55.176 --> 20:57.251
You got a partial thickness burn.

20:57.285 --> 20:58.218
I'll give you something for the pain,

20:58.253 --> 21:00.254
and I'll get you
on the next trip down, okay?

21:00.288 --> 21:01.922
I was supposed to pick my kid up early.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.591
But I got pulled onto this work
thing tonight, so I canceled.

21:04.626 --> 21:06.860
Oh, she was so upset. I felt awful.

21:06.894 --> 21:08.562
I should've just gone. Why didn't I go?

21:08.596 --> 21:10.597
Sure, okay, you got trapped
for a minute by some fire,

21:10.632 --> 21:11.865
and you got out.

21:11.899 --> 21:13.433
These burns will get better.

21:13.468 --> 21:15.669
You will get to go home
to your kid tonight.

21:15.703 --> 21:18.739
That makes today a very good day.

21:18.773 --> 21:20.080
See, Montgomery and I here,

21:20.105 --> 21:21.775
- we already decided.
- Yes, we did!

21:21.809 --> 21:23.910
We decided today may be scary,

21:23.945 --> 21:25.879
but it's not bad... it's good.

21:25.913 --> 21:27.214
You're getting out of here.

21:27.248 --> 21:29.850
Today's a good day, okay?

21:31.219 --> 21:32.779
No smoke.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.276
No smoke.

21:35.323 --> 21:36.356
Thank you, by the way,

21:36.391 --> 21:39.059
for volunteering us
for the floor with no fire.

21:39.093 --> 21:40.961
Are any of the drills helping?

21:40.995 --> 21:42.429
I think I see an improvement,

21:42.463 --> 21:45.365
but maybe that's just wishful thinking.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.935
You know, that thing
with Jack leaving the station,

21:48.970 --> 21:51.405
if I don't get over my fear soon,

21:51.439 --> 21:52.639
that'll be me, too.

21:52.674 --> 21:53.807
I'll have to quit.

21:53.841 --> 21:55.208
You'll get over your fear.

21:55.243 --> 21:56.176
Haven't yet.

21:56.210 --> 21:58.145
Why does it feel like
the band is breaking up?

21:58.179 --> 22:00.247
Well, at least you're not
the one leaving the band.

22:00.281 --> 22:02.482
Andy will still be here,
even if she's not in charge.

22:02.517 --> 22:05.118
I always pictured Andy and me
running this place together,

22:05.153 --> 22:07.788
not me and somebody else.

22:07.822 --> 22:09.589
But you...

22:12.627 --> 22:14.661
I'm getting out of here right now.

22:14.696 --> 22:15.996
Mr. Sorensen, I've told you,

22:16.030 --> 22:17.397
I can't let anyone leave this floor

22:17.432 --> 22:18.799
as fire evacuation captain.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.634
The building is on fire!

22:20.668 --> 22:24.104
And you and your stupid vest
cannot keep me here!

22:24.138 --> 22:25.906
She can, actually.

22:25.940 --> 22:26.940
See, right now, the fire department

22:26.974 --> 22:27.874
is in charge of this building.

22:27.909 --> 22:30.477
And we put Molly in charge of this door.

22:30.511 --> 22:32.145
Would you like to sit somewhere?

22:32.180 --> 22:33.680
Maybe get a bag to breathe into?

22:33.715 --> 22:36.483
Yeah?

22:39.554 --> 22:41.021
Let's check the rest of these
vents along the floor,

22:41.055 --> 22:43.690
make sure they're not hiding
any more flare-ups.

22:43.725 --> 22:45.158
Did you need to ask me something earlier?

22:45.193 --> 22:47.494
I guess there's never
a perfect time. Yeah.

22:49.297 --> 22:52.599
It was about that garage fire last shift.

22:52.633 --> 22:54.868
I'm the reason why you were trapped.

22:54.902 --> 22:56.323
The panel wasn't faulty.

22:56.358 --> 22:58.772
I... I entered the numbers incorrectly.

22:58.806 --> 23:00.307
It was a high-pressure situation.

23:00.341 --> 23:01.441
Could have happened to any of us.

23:01.476 --> 23:03.877
But it happened to me because
my head was kind of fuzzy.

23:03.911 --> 23:05.479
I was...

23:05.513 --> 23:08.382
I was tired because
I was out all night with JJ.

23:10.885 --> 23:11.936
- Okay.
- I... I thought

23:11.970 --> 23:14.121
I had my radio synched
with everybody else's.

23:14.155 --> 23:16.723
It turns out I-I was
on the wrong channel and...

23:16.758 --> 23:18.859
Look, that's why you were trapped...

23:18.893 --> 23:21.495
because I wasn't paying enough attention.

23:23.279 --> 23:24.631
It was my fault.

23:28.536 --> 23:30.303
- We almost died in there.
- I know.

23:33.207 --> 23:35.375
And that's all I can think about.

23:35.410 --> 23:38.211
That's why I had to tell you,
because you're my guy!

23:38.246 --> 23:42.048
And I couldn't live
with myself if... if...

23:44.051 --> 23:45.185
Oh, no.

23:45.219 --> 23:47.654
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

23:49.023 --> 23:50.190
Gibson here.

23:50.224 --> 23:53.493
We've got a massive load
of combustible materials on 26.

23:53.528 --> 23:54.928
Paint sealant, you name it.

23:54.962 --> 23:57.030
Fire's coming through the floor.

23:57.064 --> 23:58.665
If it hits this stuff, it'll blow.

23:58.699 --> 24:01.268
And there's enough to bring
the whole building down.

24:01.302 --> 24:02.502
This place needs to be

24:02.537 --> 24:04.204
completely evacuated immediately.

24:11.975 --> 24:13.976
We've gotta wrap things up here, people.

24:14.011 --> 24:15.478
Move everyone downstairs.

24:15.512 --> 24:18.214
Hey, I got about 100 civilians
on the top floor.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.549
- We need evac.
- What can we do?

24:19.583 --> 24:21.484
I can't send the elevator
past the fire line,

24:21.518 --> 24:22.818
and the stairwells are
full of black smoke,

24:22.853 --> 24:25.221
but there's a PPV fan on Floor 27.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.270
It'll draw all the smoke
out of the stairs

24:26.305 --> 24:27.290
so we can get those people down.

24:27.324 --> 24:28.534
Copy that.

24:29.860 --> 24:30.960
Tanner speaking.

24:30.994 --> 24:32.428
<i>Tanner, I need your help.</i>

24:32.462 --> 24:34.897
Listen, I, uh

24:34.932 --> 24:36.732
Don't want to pull an Aid Car
from the scene,

24:36.767 --> 24:39.335
but my breathing is shallow.

24:39.369 --> 24:41.003
<i>I think I need to see a doctor.</i>

24:41.038 --> 24:42.305
Don't think I should drive.

24:42.339 --> 24:44.440
Are you around to come pick me up?

24:44.474 --> 24:46.409
I can come get you.
I'm being tagged out, anyway.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.477
- But Andy...
<i>- Doesn't need to be bothered.</i>

24:48.512 --> 24:51.280
I've gotten in her way enough.
Never mind.

24:51.315 --> 24:55.751
It's fine. Just... I'm fine.

24:59.489 --> 25:01.691
She needs a splint and ice packs!

25:01.725 --> 25:03.694
Report in. Do you you copy?

25:04.461 --> 25:05.428
Damn it.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.529
What's wrong?

25:06.563 --> 25:07.730
Radios are spotty.

25:07.764 --> 25:10.366
Trying to tell our team on 28
to be ready to evac civilians

25:10.400 --> 25:11.446
once the stairwells are clear.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.102
Team 28, report in. Do you copy?

25:13.136 --> 25:14.804
I'll go. I can get them up to speed

25:14.838 --> 25:16.505
and hustle back down to help here.

25:16.540 --> 25:17.540
Good.

25:17.574 --> 25:19.508
Glad I'm getting to see you
in action, Herrera.

25:19.543 --> 25:21.177
- Keep it up.
- Thanks, Chief.

25:24.181 --> 25:25.514
You need to get out of here.

25:25.549 --> 25:27.483
You don't have any protection. No mask.

25:27.517 --> 25:28.551
You can't be breathing all this in.

25:28.585 --> 25:29.418
I know. I-I just...

25:29.453 --> 25:32.221
Just... I want you to be careful, okay?

25:32.255 --> 25:33.556
I gotta go.

25:33.590 --> 25:35.458
- Andy.
- Yeah?

25:39.363 --> 25:41.330
You be careful, too. Yeah, of course.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.409
I'll just hold my breath,
or hold a wet rag over my face!

25:53.443 --> 25:54.677
It can't be worse than burning to death!

25:54.711 --> 25:57.013
We've been trying to get someone
on radio, but it's just static.

25:57.047 --> 25:59.048
No, Ripley's ordering everyone
out of the building.

25:59.082 --> 26:00.549
You need to get these people
ready for an evac

26:00.584 --> 26:03.152
- once the stairs are clear.
- You need to sit back down!

26:03.186 --> 26:04.520
You can't stop me!

26:04.554 --> 26:07.556
Okay, that's enough!

26:07.591 --> 26:09.992
You'd suffocate before
getting down five flights.

26:10.027 --> 26:12.428
These firefighters are trying
to save your life!

26:12.462 --> 26:14.430
You make coffee and copies.

26:14.464 --> 26:16.599
We gave you the floor captain job

26:16.633 --> 26:17.900
because no one else wanted it.

26:17.934 --> 26:19.402
Now, get out of my way!

26:19.436 --> 26:20.812
No!

26:21.571 --> 26:22.872
You may think that I'm a joke

26:22.906 --> 26:25.007
or... or that this job is a joke.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.676
But... But I don't care, okay?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.377
I take it seriously.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.579
And it is my job to keep you safe.

26:30.614 --> 26:32.415
And letting you go down
those stairs is not safe,

26:32.449 --> 26:35.885
so you need to shut up and stay put!

26:35.919 --> 26:40.089
You may be my boss,
but you are not going anywhere.

26:44.995 --> 26:46.862
And that should be
the vent control box, right?

26:46.897 --> 26:48.631
Go for it.

26:57.474 --> 27:00.910
Listen up! I need everybody
to divide up into groups of 10!

27:00.944 --> 27:03.879
But, remember, walk briskly... don't run.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.448
It's not a race.

27:05.482 --> 27:09.218
I can't believe I did that.
That's my boss.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.721
I just yelled at my boss.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.223
I'm trapped inside a burning inferno,

27:14.257 --> 27:15.958
and that was kind of the scariest thing

27:15.992 --> 27:17.226
that happened all day.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.194
What if I get fired?

27:18.228 --> 27:20.296
If there's one thing
I'm starting to realize,

27:20.330 --> 27:23.399
it's that impressing your boss
isn't everything.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.735
Don't rely on anybody else
to have faith in you.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.170
You did what's right.
That's what matters.

27:29.806 --> 27:30.903
All right, give it a few.

27:30.937 --> 27:32.641
See if the smoke has started to clear.

27:32.676 --> 27:33.844
It shouldn't be long.

27:34.511 --> 27:36.579
Molly, you should head down
with group one, okay?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.180
No. No, no, no.

27:38.215 --> 27:41.250
I-I should...
I-I should stay and help. I...

27:41.284 --> 27:42.284
Okay, that's our job.

27:42.319 --> 27:44.019
Your job is to lead
the others down to safety.

27:44.054 --> 27:45.354
Can you do that for us?

27:45.388 --> 27:48.424
Really? Because, um...

27:48.458 --> 27:50.025
I know my mom's outside the building,

27:50.060 --> 27:51.594
and she's in the crowd somewhere.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.829
And she's been texting me
to make sure I'm okay.

27:53.864 --> 27:54.830
And, honestly, I wouldn't mind

27:54.865 --> 27:56.867
seeing my mom right now.

27:57.667 --> 28:02.204
Listen up, group one, you're
gonna go down with Molly, okay?!

28:02.239 --> 28:03.439
Let's go!

28:06.676 --> 28:08.878
Slowly. Slow.

28:08.912 --> 28:10.546
Please take your time.

28:12.349 --> 28:13.849
We need you in this group.

28:16.720 --> 28:17.636
Okay, one.

28:17.670 --> 28:19.556
Bishop, do you hear something?

28:20.991 --> 28:22.625
Maya, do you hear that?

28:22.659 --> 28:23.859
Yeah, you're next.

28:23.894 --> 28:24.860
Maya!

28:24.895 --> 28:26.529
Chief, how much longer
till that evac's complete?

28:26.563 --> 28:28.531
We can't hold this floor forever.

28:30.901 --> 28:32.668
Do you hear something?

28:35.572 --> 28:36.739
The fire's jumping floors!

28:36.773 --> 28:38.707
It's moving through the space
between the window panes!

28:38.742 --> 28:41.510
The fire's jumping floors!

28:41.545 --> 28:43.045
- Aah!
- Ohh!

28:43.079 --> 28:46.015
Maya, get away from the window!

28:52.722 --> 28:55.858
Ohh, geez.

28:55.892 --> 28:58.386
Montgomery, you okay?

28:59.262 --> 29:00.663
Hey, Travis.

29:24.157 --> 29:27.459
Wait! No, no, no, no! Not all at once!

29:27.494 --> 29:29.561
Go!

29:39.539 --> 29:40.639
Vic.

29:40.673 --> 29:41.840
Vic.

29:43.176 --> 29:44.576
Get everyone out safe.

29:44.611 --> 29:45.911
I'll hook a hose to the pipe

29:45.945 --> 29:47.546
and knock a path out to the stairwell.

29:47.580 --> 29:50.682
- Are you sure?
- More than sure. I'm good.

29:50.717 --> 29:52.518
I'm freaking great, actually. I got this.

30:02.429 --> 30:05.564
Status report, Warren? Right now.

30:05.598 --> 30:07.733
Penetrating wound, extensive bleeding,

30:07.767 --> 30:09.835
partially subdued by the glass.

30:09.869 --> 30:12.104
Mayday. Repeat. Mayday.

30:12.138 --> 30:14.440
Firefighter down.
Need immediate assistance.

30:14.474 --> 30:16.341
No point if the radio's not working.

30:19.145 --> 30:20.512
We're gonna get you down to triage.

30:20.547 --> 30:21.680
All right, they have clamps and sutures.

30:21.714 --> 30:22.748
That's all we got to do.

30:22.782 --> 30:25.584
It's just a few floors down.

30:25.618 --> 30:27.853
If the glass nicked my pulmonary artery,

30:27.887 --> 30:29.621
I'll bleed out before we even get there.

30:29.656 --> 30:32.624
I don't think it did.
Pretty sure it didn't.

30:32.659 --> 30:35.294
Well, I guess we'll find out
in a couple of minutes.

30:48.441 --> 30:51.710
Ooooh, oohoohh

30:51.744 --> 30:54.146
A lot of chiefs would be
downstairs already,

30:54.180 --> 30:55.481
safe in the lobby.

30:55.515 --> 30:57.883
It's just not how I like to do things.

30:57.917 --> 30:59.424
I hear that.

31:00.186 --> 31:02.754
Seeing how you like to do things
tonight, too, Herrera.

31:02.789 --> 31:05.057
Feel like I'm learning a lot about you.

31:05.091 --> 31:06.124
Good things.

31:06.159 --> 31:07.178
Glad to hear it, sir.

31:08.595 --> 31:09.628
All right.

31:24.444 --> 31:25.867
Hello?

31:26.546 --> 31:27.619
Pruitt?

31:29.215 --> 31:30.916
Mr. Herrera, I'm here.

31:33.019 --> 31:34.786
Captain Herrera... have you seen him?

31:34.821 --> 31:36.622
Uh, no. I'm looking for him, too.

31:36.656 --> 31:39.324
Pushed a doctor's appointment
he had with me until late,

31:39.359 --> 31:41.493
but he never showed up.

31:41.528 --> 31:44.296
I waited, called. Never answered.

31:44.330 --> 31:46.098
I got worried.

31:46.132 --> 31:47.766
Captain?

31:51.804 --> 31:53.205
Hello?

31:57.677 --> 31:59.845
Anybody here?

31:59.879 --> 32:02.114
I'm gonna go check...

32:02.148 --> 32:03.482
Oh, no.

32:04.817 --> 32:06.485
Oh, no.

32:06.519 --> 32:08.654
Oh, my God.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.193
Pruitt!

32:19.566 --> 32:21.500
Yeah, he's unresponsive.

32:22.669 --> 32:24.803
Oh, barely breathing.

32:26.539 --> 32:27.573
And no pulse.

32:27.607 --> 32:29.474
Beginning CPR.

32:35.081 --> 32:36.582
The flare-ups are increasing.

32:36.616 --> 32:38.884
We need to secure this floor and go.

32:38.918 --> 32:41.653
Yeah, I'll start by closing
the fire doors.

32:42.722 --> 32:44.423
Best way to contain the explosion.

32:46.726 --> 32:47.726
Hey, what's that?

32:48.795 --> 32:50.195
Do you hear that?

32:50.229 --> 32:51.697
I think somebody's in there!

32:56.603 --> 32:59.071
I thought this was the exit.

33:01.608 --> 33:02.841
He's inhaled a lot of smoke.

33:02.875 --> 33:05.344
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

33:05.378 --> 33:06.745
Hey, hey, stay with me, all right?

33:06.779 --> 33:08.747
Stay with me.

33:08.781 --> 33:12.117
We got an incapacitated victim
on the 26th floor.

33:12.151 --> 33:15.854
Stairs aren't passable.
We need an elevator evac now!

33:15.888 --> 33:16.855
Negative, Gibson.

33:16.889 --> 33:18.757
We can't send the elevator
past the fire line.

33:18.791 --> 33:19.958
<i>We have no other choice, sir.</i>

33:19.993 --> 33:21.693
We've already evacuated Base Camp.

33:21.728 --> 33:23.095
Save who you can. Get yourselves out.

33:23.129 --> 33:24.429
You know the protocol.

33:24.464 --> 33:26.098
<i>There's a block. Elevator's our only way.</i>

33:26.132 --> 33:28.934
Protocol? You're gonna abandon
them because of protocol?

33:28.968 --> 33:30.202
If fire breaches the elevator,

33:30.236 --> 33:31.536
this whole building could be compromised.

33:31.571 --> 33:32.938
The building's already compromised.

33:32.972 --> 33:35.140
I'm the Chief. My word is final.

33:35.174 --> 33:36.742
As much as I hate it,

33:36.776 --> 33:38.910
I'm prepared to gamble one life
in order to save hundreds.

33:38.945 --> 33:40.312
It's a terrible decision to make,

33:40.346 --> 33:42.147
but that's the job... the job you want.

33:44.017 --> 33:45.784
Gibson, the elevator's on its way.

33:55.408 --> 33:58.043
You know what I...
You know what I can't wait for?

33:58.077 --> 34:00.412
Tomorrow.

34:00.446 --> 34:03.682
Because tomorrow,
we are gonna laugh and laugh

34:03.716 --> 34:06.418
about me pulling you down
all these damn stairs.

34:09.489 --> 34:12.291
Hey, hey, Montgomery.

34:12.324 --> 34:15.393
You stay awake.
You stay awake. You hear me?

34:15.428 --> 34:17.129
I'm laughing already.

34:19.565 --> 34:21.533
Hello?

34:21.568 --> 34:23.601
Somebody there?

34:23.636 --> 34:25.237
Could be a sweep.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.806
Hey! Hey, we're up here!

34:29.108 --> 34:30.641
Help. Oh, help. Oh, my God.

34:30.677 --> 34:33.946
Help. Please help. Please help.

34:33.980 --> 34:35.547
Please help.

34:35.581 --> 34:36.581
They wouldn't stop.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.384
They just kept going,
and they wouldn't stop.

34:39.418 --> 34:40.705
They wouldn't stop.

34:40.739 --> 34:42.420
They ran right over you,
from the looks of it.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.989
Okay, careful, careful. Don't move.

34:44.023 --> 34:46.128
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Shh.

34:47.994 --> 34:49.995
How are her breath sounds?

34:50.029 --> 34:51.096
They're shallow.

34:54.967 --> 34:57.135
Yeah, I hear crepitus.
It's a pneumothorax.

34:57.170 --> 35:00.005
I need to re-inflate
her lungs with the...

35:00.039 --> 35:01.777
I don't know with what.

35:01.811 --> 35:03.141
Ben.

35:10.016 --> 35:12.084
Yeah, it's bleeding more.

35:12.118 --> 35:13.845
The glass must have shifted.

35:14.860 --> 35:17.022
She's gonna die
if you don't get her downstairs.

35:18.691 --> 35:21.280
So will you if I don't keep
holding pressure on this.

35:21.315 --> 35:24.963
I once told you what we do
and what you do,

35:24.998 --> 35:28.200
you know, are two very different things.

35:28.234 --> 35:32.104
You are a surgeon.
Save the life you can save.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.825
We both know that's not mine.

35:40.413 --> 35:42.547
- Montgomery...
- Hey.

35:45.218 --> 35:48.120
This was gonna be such a good day.

35:54.994 --> 35:58.330
Stairway's still pretty dark,
but the smoke's lifting.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.032
Hey, what happened back there?

36:00.066 --> 36:01.333
Didn't you hear me yelling for you?

36:03.102 --> 36:04.703
Why didn't you move out the way?

36:06.906 --> 36:08.540
I guess I just missed it.

36:29.529 --> 36:31.697
You didn't have to tell me
about the garage.

36:31.731 --> 36:32.764
- Yeah.
- But you did.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.032
Of course, man.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.500
You <i>are</i> my guy.

36:35.535 --> 36:37.069
I know. Come on, man.

36:37.103 --> 36:38.236
We gotta go.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.708
You gotta watch his vitals.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.676
His pulse is thready.

36:46.279 --> 36:48.246
Get him on concentrated O2 immediately.

36:48.281 --> 36:49.915
Yeah, I know.

36:49.949 --> 36:52.517
Only a matter of minutes
before this entire floor blows.

36:54.454 --> 36:57.289
We didn't finish closing the fire doors.

36:59.325 --> 37:01.193
No. Jack, what are you doing?!

37:01.227 --> 37:03.195
Jack, no!

37:08.334 --> 37:10.535
No.

37:10.570 --> 37:12.571
Okay, we got to go.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.307
We got to get to Grey-Sloan,
and we got to get there now.

37:15.341 --> 37:16.808
- My car has sirens.
- Okay.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.436
I need my key back.

37:38.598 --> 37:40.399
<i>Elevator's a go.</i>

37:40.433 --> 37:41.566
<i>They're on their way down.</i>

37:41.601 --> 37:43.602
They? Who's "they," Jack?

37:45.171 --> 37:46.471
Jack, where are you?

37:48.042 --> 37:51.169
Stay back. Got to get the rest
of these fire doors closed.

37:51.801 --> 37:53.445
<i>Jack, no, you can't.</i>

37:56.315 --> 37:57.582
Talk to me.

38:02.622 --> 38:04.432
There's no time.

38:05.224 --> 38:06.525
Yes, there is time.

38:06.559 --> 38:08.978
Talk to me right now, face-to-face.

38:24.143 --> 38:27.546
Figure out a way to get to the stairs.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.281
Rappel down this shaft, something!

38:29.315 --> 38:31.149
Just get off that floor!

38:31.184 --> 38:33.285
I can't. Stairs are blocked.

38:33.319 --> 38:35.153
I don't have the right gear or the O2.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.489
I can help the most right here.

38:37.523 --> 38:40.792
Try to secure these doors,
save the building.

38:40.827 --> 38:42.360
You know, I didn't send you that elevator

38:42.395 --> 38:43.495
for you to not take it.

38:46.165 --> 38:47.232
Don't... Don't do this.

38:49.902 --> 38:54.306
Don't be a hero, Jack.
Just... Just be alive, okay?

38:54.340 --> 38:56.074
- You can find a way to...
- Save myself?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.111
Maybe.

39:00.012 --> 39:01.913
But what about everybody else?

39:01.948 --> 39:03.849
Hughes and Bishop...
aren't they still upstairs?

39:03.883 --> 39:06.518
Montgomery, Warren...
have you heard from them?

39:06.552 --> 39:08.687
Miller's still riding down
in the elevator right now.

39:08.721 --> 39:11.323
Our entire team's still in this building.

39:13.292 --> 39:15.227
You're just a couple floors beneath me.

39:17.029 --> 39:20.699
I won't sacrifice losing
any of you to save me.

39:21.934 --> 39:24.069
<i>It's not about being a hero.</i>

39:25.404 --> 39:27.539
<i>It's about facing fears.</i>

39:30.376 --> 39:33.078
<i>It's about finding strength.</i>

39:34.947 --> 39:36.047
Stay.

39:40.286 --> 39:42.454
<i>It's about going where you're needed.</i>

39:54.400 --> 39:56.919
<i>It's about making
the hardest decisions...</i>

40:02.008 --> 40:03.542
<i>...in the worst of circumstances.</i>

40:07.413 --> 40:08.747
I gotta go.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.282
There are still more doors to close.

40:13.519 --> 40:17.122
You need to run... down
as many floors as you can, okay?

40:17.156 --> 40:18.123
Jack.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.407
Andy.

40:22.361 --> 40:23.261
I lied before...

40:25.464 --> 40:27.332
...about having regrets.

40:27.366 --> 40:28.767
I don't.

40:31.270 --> 40:32.571
Not with you.

40:36.342 --> 40:37.442
I won.

40:40.112 --> 40:43.299
Stay on the radio with me, okay?

40:44.517 --> 40:46.719
Okay.

40:47.277 --> 40:48.420
Okay, I will.

40:52.124 --> 40:53.158
Okay.

41:12.411 --> 41:14.622
<i>It's about seeing the whole picture.</i>

41:15.081 --> 41:18.450
<i>It's about knowing
how to follow and how to lead.</i>

41:19.819 --> 41:21.152
<i>It's not about us.</i>

41:22.355 --> 41:23.381
<i>I told you.</i>

41:24.090 --> 41:25.549
Keep talking to me.

41:26.559 --> 41:27.892
<i>I know. I am.</i>

41:27.927 --> 41:29.694
I mean it. I want to hear
you're still there.

41:29.729 --> 41:31.696
<i>I am. I'm here.</i>

41:31.731 --> 41:34.232
I'm heading for the stairs now.
You still there?

41:34.266 --> 41:35.700
- Yep, I'm here.
- Okay.

41:35.735 --> 41:37.102
I'm heading down now, okay?

41:43.709 --> 41:45.543
Jack, I said, "I'm heading down."

41:52.551 --> 41:53.952
Jack, talk to me!

42:00.189 --> 42:01.326
Jack!

42:02.475 --> 42:04.329
<i>We're just doing what has to be done.</i>

42:11.437 --> 42:13.138
<i>Somebody has to.</i>
