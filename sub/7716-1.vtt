WEBVTT

00:02.794 --> 00:04.086
Oh, for god's sake

00:07.090 --> 00:09.216
Planking is a very stupid
and dangerous trend

00:09.300 --> 00:11.427
Basically you lie like
a plank in weird places

00:12.137 --> 00:13.178
That's it.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.805
Sometimes you get run over

00:15.557 --> 00:16.724
Welcome to the Internet

00:17.267 --> 00:19.601
Planking is one of
those things where

00:19.936 --> 00:22.271
hey, you either
get it or you don't

00:23.606 --> 00:26.442
And I don't. But I am so
excited to be a part of it.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.863
After you
my good sir

00:30.947 --> 00:31.947
No, I insist

00:32.031 --> 00:33.741
The search committee
finally decided,

00:33.825 --> 00:35.534
after a lot of deliberation

00:35.618 --> 00:38.954
on Robert California
for the manager position

00:40.165 --> 00:42.958
Who took one look
around and left.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.838
He drove down to Florida and
convinced Jo to make him C.E.O

00:50.675 --> 00:53.135
C.E.O. Her own job

00:53.845 --> 00:55.095
He talked her
out of her own job

00:55.180 --> 00:57.014
and I don't really know
how someone does that

00:57.140 --> 01:00.309
but anyway then the
position was his to fill

01:00.977 --> 01:02.561
and he chose

01:08.610 --> 01:10.235
It's unbelievable

01:11.071 --> 01:13.072
True. I may have
been tee second choice,

01:13.156 --> 01:15.365
but I was the first
choice's first choice.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.742
And about Dwight,

01:16.826 --> 01:19.745
have some resentment
about not getting the job

01:19.829 --> 01:21.163
so I sat him down
and we had a talk

01:21.372 --> 01:24.083
And I told him, "I need a
really strong number two

01:24.167 --> 01:25.417
"I want you to
be my enforcer.'

01:26.044 --> 01:27.544
Smart, right?
Very smart

01:30.465 --> 01:31.673
This has got to stop

01:33.009 --> 01:34.843
Hey! Kevin

01:36.638 --> 01:39.932
Yeah, at first I was
really disappointed

01:40.016 --> 01:42.810
But I've got a great daily
routine going right now

01:42.894 --> 01:44.603
I've upped my karate
to eight times a week.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.730
I've added boxing at
lunches and on weekends,

01:46.815 --> 01:49.900
I do kick-boxing three times a
week, Krav Maga four times a week,

01:49.984 --> 01:52.402
an hour of meditation
every morning at sunrise,

01:52.487 --> 01:54.029
and again at sunset.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.032
So yeah
I'm doing great

01:57.867 --> 01:59.243
I'm going to need
some help. Pam?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.790
Oh, yeah. Pregnant

02:04.874 --> 02:06.792
Right here.
Little Michael Scott

02:06.876 --> 02:09.169
Nope. I told you I
don't like that joke

02:09.253 --> 02:10.963
It is a boy.
We found out early

02:11.047 --> 02:13.674
Much different
the second time around

02:13.758 --> 02:15.801
And I have to say
it is nice not being

02:15.885 --> 02:17.594
the only pregnant
woman in the office

02:18.847 --> 02:22.474
Look, it's "little
pregs" and "big pregs."

02:23.017 --> 02:24.476
Wait, when did we start
calling each other

02:24.561 --> 02:27.146
Isn't it amazing the
difference in our sizes?

02:27.230 --> 02:28.981
Well, I am a few
months ahead of you

02:29.065 --> 02:31.733
I'm having a child with
my husband the senator

02:31.818 --> 02:36.405
And Pam is having a child
with Jim The great salesman

02:36.489 --> 02:38.073
Hoist him aloft

02:38.908 --> 02:40.742
Come on, Darryl, lift
Lift, Darryl

02:40.827 --> 02:42.119
Come on, man

02:42.203 --> 02:45.622
Yeah, I wanted the manager job,
but I got something much better

02:48.042 --> 02:49.209
This soda

02:50.170 --> 02:51.378
This is mine

02:51.838 --> 02:56.258
It might be easier if you take a
deep breath lift from the knees,

02:56.342 --> 02:57.885
and shove it
up your butt

02:59.888 --> 03:01.388
a new thing this summer

03:01.472 --> 03:03.932
I act like I'm telling
someone how to do something.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.352
A long description
and then I say...

03:07.437 --> 03:09.146
And shove it up your butt

03:11.566 --> 03:14.443
It's stupid,
but it's my thing now

03:14.527 --> 03:16.820
No one should be
planking at all.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.447
Thank you. Yes

03:19.574 --> 03:22.534
Dwight my enforcer, my number
two can you take care of this?

03:22.619 --> 03:23.827
Say no more

03:25.000 --> 03:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:35.173 --> 03:37.966
Kids, don't try planking
it's dangerous.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.303
Especially with me around

04:12.418 --> 04:13.502
Are you watching
that commercial again?

04:16.172 --> 04:18.966
Why do you keep watching it if you
know it's just going to make you cry?

04:19.050 --> 04:21.927
Because everything makes me
cry so what's the difference?

04:23.346 --> 04:26.848
This dog he just wants
to protect his bone

04:27.183 --> 04:28.934
He's got a bank vault
That's a start.

04:29.018 --> 04:29.977
Not enough, though

04:30.061 --> 04:31.061
All right

04:36.943 --> 04:39.778
The new C.E.O. works out of the
conference room about half the time

04:39.862 --> 04:44.032
but whenever he takes a break he does
these weird walks around the office.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.243
And you never know who
he's going to zero in on

04:46.327 --> 04:48.495
for these really
intense small talks

04:48.579 --> 04:50.872
You just hope
it's not you.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.335
And yet you hope it is
you, too It's strange

05:02.051 --> 05:03.719
Here we go.
Hello

05:04.262 --> 05:06.888
Robert California.
Let's have a conversation

05:07.265 --> 05:08.807
Describe your day so far

05:08.891 --> 05:10.600
Well, I woke up and

05:10.685 --> 05:13.020
When you recount your day,
never say you woke up

05:13.104 --> 05:14.313
It's a waste of your time

05:14.397 --> 05:17.399
That's how every day has begun for
everyone since the dawn of man.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.818
Very smart
Very smart

05:21.487 --> 05:25.073
Suddenly, I was awake
and I...

05:25.158 --> 05:30.787
Hey, Robert We have that 9:30 A.M.
casual chit chat scheduled

05:30.872 --> 05:34.374
I emailed you about it last eight
to confirm. And again this morning

05:34.459 --> 05:36.460
First item on the agenda
can I get everyone

05:36.544 --> 05:38.503
an extra long
Columbus Day weekend?

05:38.588 --> 05:40.922
Item number two,
connect with the guy

05:41.632 --> 05:44.301
Robert California,
what does he think of me?

05:44.385 --> 05:45.761
Don't know
Super care.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.556
Number three, time permitting
we lost our biggest client.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.905
Pam. Pam
Past! Pam.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.171
Jim

06:30.765 --> 06:34.434
Can I call you right back?
Thank you very much.

06:35.770 --> 06:36.770
Okay

06:40.066 --> 06:41.233
What is this?

06:43.945 --> 06:46.405
The Friday before
Columbus Day, thoughts?

06:46.489 --> 06:47.614
What are your thoughts?

06:47.698 --> 06:49.032
Just making chit-chat

06:50.618 --> 06:53.370
Kind of a medium year
for women's soccer, no?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.541
What are you looking at?

06:58.334 --> 06:59.709
It's nothing

06:59.836 --> 07:01.920
It can't be nothing
Yeah, it can't be nothing.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.631
It's just a list of our names
split into two columns

07:04.715 --> 07:06.174
What?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.844
Okay, just wait one second all right?
I will copy it

07:09.470 --> 07:11.179
Do you have a pen?
No

07:11.264 --> 07:12.305
No

07:13.099 --> 07:15.308
Okay. Um, I'll take
a photo of it.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.726
Dwight, can you
throw me my phone?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.190
Nice catch

07:22.859 --> 07:24.359
If he comes out
distract him.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.445
We need a warning signal

07:26.529 --> 07:28.238
We don't need
a warning signal, Kevin

07:28.364 --> 07:29.448
We can see him right there.
- We do.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.532
Don't need a...

07:30.616 --> 07:33.785
Warning! Warning Warning!
Warning! Warning

07:34.162 --> 07:35.620
Phyllis!
Phyllis

07:37.665 --> 07:38.915
You okay?

07:41.419 --> 07:42.711
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.212
One, two, three

07:44.297 --> 07:45.338
Thanks, guys

07:49.051 --> 07:52.095
Okay. Which side
of the list am I on?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.222
Left
Yes

07:54.307 --> 07:56.558
Why are you...
How do you know?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.936
Really great
list of names, guys

08:00.605 --> 08:02.355
Thank you so much
Good work.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.150
No, actually, that was
in Robert's notebook.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.235
He left it at reception
and we photocopied it

08:07.612 --> 08:08.653
Oh

08:08.738 --> 08:11.698
Okay. I don't want
any part of this.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.159
Maybe it's the list of people
he's going to fire.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.661
Okay.
It's not that, Pam

08:17.455 --> 08:18.997
You know I was
thinking it reminds me

08:19.081 --> 08:20.540
of those lists
Dwight used to make

08:20.625 --> 08:22.417
This is if we were a
on a cruise ship

08:22.502 --> 08:24.252
and had to divide
into life boats.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.879
And this is if we
were on a cruise ship

08:25.963 --> 08:27.714
and had to divide
into life rafts.

08:28.090 --> 08:32.260
Here's something "Who would eat
who in an Alive situation?'

08:35.515 --> 08:37.682
No. That can't be it

08:37.767 --> 08:38.725
I gotta say

08:38.808 --> 08:41.811
it kind of seems like the left
side is the side to be on

08:42.313 --> 08:44.856
Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl
no offense, Pam.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.608
Excuse me?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.652
Shh. Pam, come on Don't
be such a right-sider.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.781
Did you guys figure it out?
We couldn't crack it

08:52.865 --> 08:55.450
Go in there, just ask
the man what it means

08:55.535 --> 08:59.746
He'll know that we looked
at his private notebook

09:00.331 --> 09:02.290
Come on Just say you saw
the list by accident

09:02.375 --> 09:04.709
I'm already working on this
Columbus Day thing for you guys

09:04.794 --> 09:07.212
And it's starting
to stack up.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.880
It feels like a lot
One thing at a time

09:08.965 --> 09:11.925
Yeah, that's all you had to do
today is ask about Columbus Day?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.391
Yes. For god's sake
Andy, yes. Come in.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.937
What's up?

09:24.021 --> 09:26.439
Weird thing.
Totally awkward

09:27.316 --> 09:30.068
But you left your notebook
on the reception desk.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.194
Great. Thank you

09:31.279 --> 09:33.947
And it was open

09:35.157 --> 09:37.117
and people saw this

09:37.201 --> 09:39.160
and they're just kind of
going nuts and, like...

09:39.245 --> 09:40.245
What is this?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.288
...wondering what it is

09:41.372 --> 09:43.415
It's a photocopy
from your notebook

09:43.499 --> 09:47.127
You read my notebook? And
photocopied it and distributed it?

09:48.838 --> 09:53.633
No. They did. And they asked
me to ask you about it

09:54.051 --> 09:55.677
Please

09:57.930 --> 09:59.014
Oh

09:59.307 --> 10:01.057
Here's what it is
it's a doodle.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.601
What?

10:02.685 --> 10:06.021
Some people doodle at work
when they let their mind run

10:06.105 --> 10:07.647
They draw houses, penises

10:07.732 --> 10:10.734
funny how the houses
are always colonials

10:10.818 --> 10:12.527
and the penises are
always circumcised

10:12.612 --> 10:14.571
Don't you think?

10:15.197 --> 10:19.200
Well, I doodle too but I'm not an
artist so I draw words and lists

10:20.828 --> 10:23.705
That is fascinating

10:23.789 --> 10:25.915
And by the way
I am so glad I asked

10:26.000 --> 10:28.585
People were just sort of...
Did you just move my name?

10:28.669 --> 10:31.463
Might as well have
been sketching a cube

10:37.053 --> 10:39.054
Okay, Robert's in the annex
everybody think quick

10:39.138 --> 10:40.472
What do these
groups have in common?

10:40.556 --> 10:42.474
Maybe we're supposed to do
it with people in our group.

10:42.558 --> 10:43.850
That's not it

10:43.934 --> 10:45.101
People in
the other group

10:45.186 --> 10:46.519
Mmm. Still wrong

10:46.604 --> 10:49.356
Stanley, you do puzzles
all day What do we got?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.650
Well, you take the first
letter from each name

10:51.734 --> 10:54.110
assign it a number
add them all up,

10:54.195 --> 10:55.862
and shove it up your butt

10:55.946 --> 10:58.323
Thank you, a little
much needed comic relief

10:58.407 --> 11:00.700
But we really need to
figure this out, guys

11:03.079 --> 11:04.537
It's alphabetical

11:06.374 --> 11:07.457
No, it's not

11:07.541 --> 11:08.541
Here's how we find out

11:08.626 --> 11:10.293
Let's line up and
compare the lines

11:10.378 --> 11:11.628
see if we learn
anything, okay?

11:11.712 --> 11:14.089
Left-siders over here
right-siders line up over here,

11:14.173 --> 11:15.173
face each other

11:15.257 --> 11:17.676
Match up by height
and relative weight

11:18.344 --> 11:21.137
Let's just size
each other up here

11:21.222 --> 11:23.723
And left side of the list

11:24.558 --> 11:25.767
attack

11:25.851 --> 11:27.936
Wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop!

11:28.187 --> 11:29.604
Will you stop?

11:30.856 --> 11:31.856
Dwight

11:32.108 --> 11:33.108
Don't do it

11:33.943 --> 11:34.943
What are you doing?
Stop!

11:35.778 --> 11:38.113
Warning! Warning! Warning

11:43.452 --> 11:47.997
I'd like to invite the following
people to join me for lunch.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.500
Jim, Dwight

11:50.584 --> 11:53.253
Angela, Darryl

11:54.630 --> 11:57.799
Kevin, Toby
Phyllis, Oscar

11:59.885 --> 12:02.429
That's great.
Let's do this, guys

12:03.723 --> 12:07.267
All right. Well,
I will see you in a bit

12:08.644 --> 12:12.230
Hey, it's nothing
all right?

12:12.648 --> 12:13.732
I'll text you
when we get there

12:13.816 --> 12:15.775
I'll let you know
what's going on Okay

12:16.110 --> 12:17.652
No. No dog video

12:17.987 --> 12:19.154
Okay
Okay.

12:19.989 --> 12:20.989
See you, guys

12:23.242 --> 12:26.369
Well, we should a
be really excited about

12:26.454 --> 12:30.206
our very own pizza party

12:30.750 --> 12:35.253
Pizza party Pizza party.
Pizza party.

12:35.337 --> 12:38.548
Jim, your daughter Cecelia what
does she think of the Street?

12:38.632 --> 12:40.133
The street?

12:40.217 --> 12:41.342
Sesame Street.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.428
Oh. I didn't know
anybody called it

12:43.512 --> 12:44.763
She likes it a lot

12:44.847 --> 12:46.389
She loves Elmo

12:46.474 --> 12:48.767
Elmo, God save us the Elmo era

12:48.851 --> 12:49.851
Right?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.603
Sesame Street was
created to reflect

12:51.687 --> 12:53.271
the environment of
the children watching it

12:54.398 --> 12:55.982
Complete self
absorption of Elmo

12:56.066 --> 12:57.984
is brilliantly
reflective of our time

12:58.652 --> 13:01.154
Ours is a cultural ghetto
Wouldn't you agree?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.741
Yeah. She does like Elmo

13:04.825 --> 13:07.994
Cultural ghetto?
Totally agree

13:08.078 --> 13:09.162
Completely

13:09.246 --> 13:11.706
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert

13:11.791 --> 13:15.543
The thing that I like about
Elmo is the tickling

13:16.921 --> 13:20.632
I don't know
I was in the wrong...

13:20.966 --> 13:23.384
I'm... I'm sorry

13:23.469 --> 13:26.346
Just picture me back there.
I was never here

13:30.100 --> 13:32.560
Great group
Pizza party.

13:32.728 --> 13:33.728
How is this a pizza party?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.021
Well, why don't you
ask me again

13:35.105 --> 13:36.272
when the five pizzas
get here?

13:36.357 --> 13:37.440
Yeah, well,
that's just pizza

13:37.525 --> 13:39.651
You need at least one other
element for it to be a party.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.486
Okay. Have you guys
ever had margarita pizza?

13:41.570 --> 13:42.570
What's that?

13:42.655 --> 13:46.741
Fresh tomato with a dollop
of mozzarella cheese.

13:46.826 --> 13:47.992
That's pizza

13:48.077 --> 13:49.953
That's regular pizza

13:50.037 --> 13:52.664
You know, I fee comfortable enough
now to ask you this question,

13:52.748 --> 13:55.333
what made you
pick this group?

13:55.417 --> 13:57.252
I just think
you guys are winners

13:57.336 --> 13:58.503
and I wanted to
have lunch with you

13:58.587 --> 13:59.671
Okay

13:59.839 --> 14:00.839
Aw.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.049
What about the other guys?

14:03.133 --> 14:05.677
Losers? Come on.
Oh, I don't know

14:05.761 --> 14:07.178
Come on. Come on

14:07.263 --> 14:08.930
I guess I think
they're losers.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.432
I knew it

14:11.517 --> 14:12.517
Yes

14:12.601 --> 14:14.060
Probably shouldn't
have said that

14:14.603 --> 14:15.687
Whoo-hoo

14:16.105 --> 14:18.815
Ah-ha! Their interpretation
of margherita pizza

14:19.984 --> 14:21.776
Fans of classic pizza
will be psyched.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.655
A text from Jim

14:25.739 --> 14:28.449
"This is getting very weird
Will explain later."

14:33.205 --> 14:34.330
Text from Kevin

14:34.415 --> 14:35.540
"Suck it, losers.'

14:40.796 --> 14:42.839
RYAN Okay, not to point out
the glaringly obvious,

14:42.923 --> 14:45.258
but doesn't the fact
that lama in this group

14:45.342 --> 14:47.635
make anyone feel just
a little bit better?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.555
Oh, this crust is sharp

14:50.639 --> 14:55.310
and sort of funny

14:56.145 --> 14:58.229
and I could do those
cute little cartoons

14:58.314 --> 15:01.816
and everyone who came
through here was like,

15:01.901 --> 15:03.985
"Who's that receptionist? I like her."

15:04.653 --> 15:06.529
Now I'm just a fat mom

15:07.573 --> 15:11.034
Yeah, and you take one look at
me and you're like, "Oh, loser."

15:11.118 --> 15:12.660
Come here, Pam

15:14.121 --> 15:15.246
Chins up, okay?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.832
Bad joke

15:19.209 --> 15:20.543
Look around this room

15:20.628 --> 15:23.171
Does this look like a group of losers?
Seriously.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.763
Oh, god

15:34.350 --> 15:36.768
Oh, hey, guys
we had so much fun.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.186
We had marguerite pizza

15:38.270 --> 15:39.938
We all hung out and got
to know each other better

15:40.022 --> 15:40.980
How was your lunch?

15:41.065 --> 15:42.982
It was excellent.
Good times

15:43.067 --> 15:44.233
Yeah?
Yeah.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.235
Oh, we did.
It was the best time

15:46.320 --> 15:49.948
And you know what? Now it's
over back to work, everyone

15:51.033 --> 15:52.033
You too, Andy

15:52.701 --> 15:53.660
I knew it.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.789
That everyone
was wrong about me.

15:58.082 --> 16:03.294
My parents, my teachers, my
friends the doctors, everyone.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.214
Well, that was
certainly an odd lunch

16:10.719 --> 16:11.719
Is everything all right?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.013
Yeah, I'm fine

16:18.769 --> 16:20.853
Just take the
casserole out of the

16:20.938 --> 16:21.980
Loser

16:22.064 --> 16:24.315
Take it out of the refrigerator,
put it in the oven

16:24.400 --> 16:27.068
It'll be fine Just leave
it in for 20 minutes

16:27.778 --> 16:29.320
Loser

16:29.405 --> 16:30.697
When I was a salesman
I could just be like,

16:30.781 --> 16:34.659
"Not my job, not my prob I'm going
to the warehouse to polish my knob."

16:35.452 --> 16:37.078
Metaphorically, of course

16:37.788 --> 16:41.249
But now,
it is my job and my prob

16:42.084 --> 16:43.084
Hi, Robert

16:44.545 --> 16:46.921
Can you come out here, please?
It's really important.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.344
Clarify something

16:54.263 --> 16:57.724
Some people here
are under the misconception

16:58.267 --> 17:02.186
that some people
may be considered

17:02.771 --> 17:04.313
let's say top tier

17:04.397 --> 17:07.150
and others would
be second tier.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.361
Thank you. Great

17:10.445 --> 17:13.114
I said winners and losers Is
that what you're talking about?

17:13.198 --> 17:17.868
Oh, that might That actually
might be what I'm thinking of.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.619
Can you clarify that?

17:19.704 --> 17:22.123
Let me tell you some
things I find productive

17:24.542 --> 17:25.960
Positive reinforcement

17:26.795 --> 17:28.296
negative reinforcement

17:28.797 --> 17:29.922
Honesty

17:30.299 --> 17:32.884
I'll tell you some things
I find unproductive

17:33.302 --> 17:36.345
Constantly worrying
about where you stand

17:36.430 --> 17:38.556
based on
inscrutable social clues

17:38.640 --> 17:42.185
and then inevitably reframing
it a in a reassuring way

17:42.269 --> 17:43.728
so that you can get
to sleep at night.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.606
No, I do not
believe in that at all

17:46.690 --> 17:49.650
If I invited you to lunch
I think you're a winner

17:50.069 --> 17:51.110
If I didn't, I don't

17:51.195 --> 17:52.945
But I just met you all

17:53.030 --> 17:55.406
Life is long,
opinions change

17:55.491 --> 17:59.786
Winners, prove me right
Losers, prove me wrong

18:07.377 --> 18:09.462
Well, I guess
that's that

18:09.546 --> 18:10.546
No

18:12.800 --> 18:14.550
No. No

18:17.304 --> 18:18.262
Andy, don't go in there

18:18.347 --> 18:19.889
I'm going in there

18:25.312 --> 18:29.148
I know that every time I talk to
you things just seem to get worse

18:29.858 --> 18:32.777
But you don't know
these people, and I do

18:32.861 --> 18:35.530
And if I let you work
with faulty information

18:35.697 --> 18:38.032
well then I'm not doing my
job as regional manager.

18:38.909 --> 18:43.037
So, please take this pen
and change your list.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.997
I'm not going to
change my list, Andy

18:45.082 --> 18:46.958
And I don't use
ballpoint pens.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.546
Well, then I w
make a new list for you

18:57.052 --> 18:59.804
Stanley, you may think
he's a lazy grump

18:59.888 --> 19:02.723
but did you know that he has the
most consistently high sales numbers

19:02.808 --> 19:04.142
of anyone in this office?

19:04.893 --> 19:06.144
And you may think
he's hard to love

19:06.228 --> 19:07.812
but did you know
that he's in not one

19:07.896 --> 19:10.064
but two long-term
romantic relationships?

19:11.108 --> 19:13.401
About the sales figures

19:13.485 --> 19:15.695
Meredith Palmer,
supplier relations

19:15.779 --> 19:18.823
The word "no,"
not even in her vocabulary

19:18.907 --> 19:20.199
And just to show you
that I'm being fair,

19:20.284 --> 19:21.492
you had Gabe in
the loser column

19:25.038 --> 19:26.414
Good call

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
Pam

19:28.709 --> 19:33.921
easily the most creative and kind
person I have ever worked with.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.007
Jim, shut the door
This is just gross.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.091
Shh

19:37.176 --> 19:40.595
Erin Hannon, the receptionist
and my closest confidant

19:40.888 --> 19:42.680
A winner if
there ever was one

19:48.854 --> 19:49.896
Are we done?

19:49.980 --> 19:50.980
Yes

19:51.064 --> 19:52.231
No

19:52.608 --> 19:54.066
The Friday
before Columbus Day

19:54.151 --> 19:55.610
we're going to
take a half-day

19:55.694 --> 19:57.612
So that everyone can get a
jump on the long weekend.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.615
You want a three-and-a-half
day weekend for Columbus Day?

20:01.450 --> 20:02.742
Yes, I do

20:02.826 --> 20:05.870
And you are aware that
Columbus and his legions

20:05.954 --> 20:09.624
committed genocide against an entire
civilization of Native Americans?

20:22.679 --> 20:23.804
Hey, guys

20:24.806 --> 20:28.059
so Columbus Day, we got
that half-day on Friday

20:28.143 --> 20:29.852
We get that every year

20:30.896 --> 20:32.313
Well, you got it
this year, too.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.442
Good night, Andy
Good night.

20:36.777 --> 20:37.777
Bye

20:39.154 --> 20:40.780
Good night, Andy

20:44.618 --> 20:45.618
Good night

20:45.702 --> 20:46.786
Night

20:58.173 --> 21:00.466
All right, I'm going
to go warm up the car

21:00.550 --> 21:01.968
Okay
Okay.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.846
You dropped something. Jim?

21:06.848 --> 21:09.725
Okay, I know I've been
crying easily today, but

21:12.854 --> 21:14.939
I mean, that's just
pretty killer, right?

21:17.567 --> 21:19.110
I mean,
maybe it's stupid

21:20.279 --> 21:21.404
No

21:23.073 --> 21:24.740
It's wonderful

21:24.825 --> 21:26.575
I'm going to frame it

21:27.305 --> 21:33.784
