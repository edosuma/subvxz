00:02.219 --> 00:03.960
[Gossip Girl]
Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:04.047 --> 00:05.657
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.744 --> 00:06.789
[Dan]
'It sounds like you
still like him.'

00:06.876 --> 00:08.356
I'm really sorry about Nate.

00:08.443 --> 00:09.966
If it's any consolation,
I don't think he ever really

00:10.053 --> 00:12.055
liked me anyway. I mean, I
haven't heard from him in weeks.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.318
[Vanessa]
Our friendship is more
important than some guy, right?

00:14.405 --> 00:15.928
[Chuck]
He has a PI on retainer.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.800
Bart's people are top-notch
and very discreet.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.758
Did you hire someone
to look into my past?

00:19.845 --> 00:21.934
Do you have
a Lily Bass dossier?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.936
Aaron asked me out,
but I said no

00:24.024 --> 00:25.721
because I wasn't
sure how you would feel.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.418
I like Aaron,
so you have my blessing.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.116
- What are you doing here?
- Well, it's Thanksgiving.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.466
And I couldn't think of anywhere
that felt more like home.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.033
- What about Bart?
- Not coming.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.512
Vanessa, I-I haven't heard
from Jenny in weeks.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.732
So, can we
get together sometime?

00:36.819 --> 00:38.168
I guess that'd be okay.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.778
As of right now,
this moment

00:39.865 --> 00:42.085
I am officially
a one-woman man.

00:46.524 --> 00:47.960
And who am I?

00:48.048 --> 00:51.355
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.183
You know you love me.

00:53.270 --> 00:56.012
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.757
Winter in New York.

01:01.844 --> 01:04.803
A gossip girl checklist
to surviving the cold

01:04.890 --> 01:08.024
cashmere stole for
ice-skating at Wollman Rink.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.547
Jacques Torres hot chocolate

01:09.634 --> 01:11.941
for window shopping
the holiday displays..

01:12.028 --> 01:13.334
...and the perfect date

01:13.421 --> 01:15.684
to the Senior Snowflake
Charity Ball.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.686
[Serena]
'B, I have other things
to do today.'

01:17.773 --> 01:20.471
Serena, this is theholiday
event for high school seniors.

01:20.558 --> 01:21.690
The creme de la creme
from all

01:21.777 --> 01:23.474
the big private schools
will be there.

01:23.561 --> 01:24.997
[Blair]
'The pictures dominate
the society pages'

01:25.085 --> 01:26.390
through the new year.
I need a ringer.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.913
[Serena]
'Wait, have all of these guys'

01:28.000 --> 01:29.089
'asked you already?'

01:29.176 --> 01:30.873
Of course,
you think Angelina Jolie

01:30.960 --> 01:33.267
even considers a project
without an offer on the table?

01:33.354 --> 01:34.659
I'm strictly
a pay or play dater.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.270
Just out of curiosity,
who's in

01:36.357 --> 01:37.967
the lead to play
Guy With No Future?

01:38.054 --> 01:40.317
What makes you think I'm not
looking for something long-term?

01:40.404 --> 01:41.318
Call it a hunch.

01:43.364 --> 01:44.843
- Keith Nelson.
- Are you kidding?

01:44.930 --> 01:46.410
Have you ever
seen him without gum?

01:46.497 --> 01:48.717
The oral fixation alone
would drive you insane.

01:50.849 --> 01:51.981
Andy Clark.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.939
Outscored your verbal
on the SATs.

01:54.026 --> 01:56.028
I like an intelligent man.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.987
He can whisper
mellifluous nothings in my ear.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.902
You only thinkyou like
an intelligent man.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.426
The moment he gave you a history
of the word mellifluous

02:02.513 --> 02:04.559
you'd rip out
his sweetly flowing tongue.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.085
Okay.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.392
Hey, Dan.
Can I ask you a question?

02:11.479 --> 02:13.568
Hey, um,
I'll call you later.

02:15.961 --> 02:16.919
So who's next?

02:19.748 --> 02:20.792
[Serena]
'Dan! Hey.'

02:20.879 --> 02:22.490
- Hey. What's up?
- Look.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.666
Wow. "Letters To A Young Poet,"
first edition.

02:24.753 --> 02:27.147
And the original Herter Norton
translation to boot.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.279
- That's..
- All thanks to you.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.628
I found it
at the rare bookstore

02:30.715 --> 02:32.064
you told me about last week.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.589
I'm giving it to Aaron
for Hanukkah.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.243
That's very nice,
it means he must've accepted

02:36.330 --> 02:37.809
your invitation
to the Snowflake Ball.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.247
Unfortunately,
he will be unable to attend.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.074
Apparently,
high society formals

02:42.162 --> 02:44.033
don't go with the whole
Brooklyn artist thing.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.992
Well, hey, it's an acquired
taste, to be sure.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.865
- Um...will you still be going?
- Absolutely.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.302
There's something I love
about the Snowflake Ball.

02:52.389 --> 02:55.479
It reminds me of Anna Karenina
only by Anna Wintour.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.264
I'll just be flying solo.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.266
That's my preferred method
of social travel. That's good.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.311
Uh, we can...we can
hang out then.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.139
Dan Humphrey, the scourge

03:03.226 --> 03:05.141
of high society
is going to the ball?

03:05.228 --> 03:06.621
I know. I'm still reeling.

03:06.708 --> 03:09.537
Uh, yeah,
I just realized that..

03:09.624 --> 03:11.713
...some of the best memories
in my past two years

03:11.800 --> 03:13.758
have, uh,
have been at those events.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.891
So I figured, why fight it?

03:15.978 --> 03:19.024
Well...look who's
embracing change.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.943
I'm-I'm assuming that Aaron
will be okay with two dateless

03:25.030 --> 03:26.380
friends hanging out
at the ball together?

03:26.467 --> 03:28.338
Yeah. He-he better be.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.079
And he's friends
with his ex, Lexi.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.386
She's actually coming to town
for the holidays.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.910
I'm going to the gallery now
to see his new installation.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.217
Do you want to come? I just
have to stop and change first.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.916
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.483
[laughs]

03:49.272 --> 03:51.622
I got your message.
What's the emergency?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.276
[sighs]
Do you consider
Muddy Waters' blues

03:53.363 --> 03:54.886
or classic rock?

03:54.973 --> 03:56.975
I'm reorganizing
my dad's record collection.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.716
- By genre.
- Why?

03:58.803 --> 04:01.023
'Because I already bound
all of Dan's short stories'

04:01.110 --> 04:02.242
and cleaned the loft twice.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.286
Did you accidentally
put Red Bull

04:03.373 --> 04:04.548
in your cereal this morning?

04:04.635 --> 04:06.158
No, I just need
to keep myself busy.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.595
Otherwise, I'm gonna start
thinking about my future

04:07.682 --> 04:08.639
and then there's gonna be
a Jenny Humphrey

04:08.726 --> 04:10.554
shaped hole through my wall.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.426
Alright, would you stop putting
so much pressure on yourself?

04:12.513 --> 04:14.645
You're back home and
you're still a great designer.

04:14.732 --> 04:15.994
The future will work
itself out.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.431
It's just that's not all
I'm thinking about.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.044
- What?
- Okay, look, I don't..

04:22.131 --> 04:24.568
I don't want to be awkward but
the one thing I can't figure out

04:24.655 --> 04:26.266
is what happened with Nate.

04:28.006 --> 04:30.226
Is that totally pathetic,
sitting around

04:30.313 --> 04:32.402
'thinking about
how some guy blew you off?'

04:32.489 --> 04:34.099
No.

04:34.186 --> 04:37.146
But in my experience,
it doesn't really help either.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.716
I'd..

04:42.630 --> 04:43.544
...move on.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.852
Yeah.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.681
[cell phone rings]

04:50.768 --> 04:53.075
[ringing continues]

04:53.162 --> 04:55.077
Sorry. I told Rufus that
I'd be at the gallery all day.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.644
So I'll see you later?

04:56.731 --> 04:59.037
Yeah. I'll be here, literally.

04:59.124 --> 05:00.735
Probably in the same spot.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.084
[chuckles]

05:04.652 --> 05:07.002
Oh, hello,
weird documentary girl.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.352
Goodbye, sad Blair wannabe.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.875
Penelope,
what are you doing here?

05:10.962 --> 05:13.225
Snowflake Ball.
I wanna commission a dress.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.140
[Penelope]
'Your fashion show
was impressive.'

05:15.227 --> 05:17.578
Thanks, but the Snowflake Ball's
tomorrow

05:17.665 --> 05:18.709
and I kinda hate you, so--

05:18.796 --> 05:20.145
I know, but this is about

05:20.232 --> 05:21.930
fashion, not friendship, J.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.019
Hazel and Is
keep biting my style

05:24.106 --> 05:25.325
and I need something custom.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.198
- I'm very expensive.
- I hope so.

05:31.374 --> 05:35.204
I think we'd better have
a second snowflake machine.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.988
I mean, it is called
the Snowflake Ball.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.076
We can't have drizzle.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.341
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.430
I thought the decorating
committee agreed on poinsettias.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.389
Oh, they did. I didn't.
Uh, Casablanca lilies.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.869
Sneaky.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.827
Hey, thanks for offering,
um, to help out.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.394
It's really been fun.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.744
Well, when you just happened
to mention my background

05:53.831 --> 05:56.225
in sound systems,
and lack of volunteer hours

05:56.312 --> 05:59.141
at the last PTA meeting,
I sort of got your signal.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.795
Sorry. I had to get
out of the house

06:00.882 --> 06:03.841
and I didn't want
to be down here alone.

06:03.928 --> 06:06.235
You and Bart
still haven't talked.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.584
No, it's my fault.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.847
Since Thanksgiving,
I've pretty much hung up

06:09.934 --> 06:11.980
the, uh, marital
Do Not Disturb sign.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.330
Well, you're gonna have to talk
to him sooner or later.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.767
Well, isn't that what
New Year's resolutions are for?

06:18.595 --> 06:19.988
Have you decided
if you're going to

06:20.075 --> 06:21.859
uh, make it
to the dance or not?

06:21.946 --> 06:23.513
Witness the fruit
of your labors?

06:24.862 --> 06:26.211
- Jury's still out.
- Alright.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.170
Well, if you do,
save me a dance.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.522
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

06:37.701 --> 06:38.833
We need to talk.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.228
Fine.

06:43.315 --> 06:46.362
[Lexi]
'Aw, they're adorable.'

06:46.449 --> 06:49.365
You know,
I feel inspired to..

06:49.452 --> 06:50.584
...shop at the GAP.

06:50.671 --> 06:53.064
'Or, um, validate my self-image'

06:53.151 --> 06:55.850
with overpriced cosmetics.
Wait a minute.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.286
You sure this one didn't
just come with the frame?

06:57.373 --> 06:58.896
Women have been the focal point

06:58.983 --> 07:00.028
for artists throughout history,
and you know it.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.464
Exactly.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.597
Yeah, way to swing
at a 2000-year-old pitch.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.990
And with blondie the bombshell,
no less..

07:06.077 --> 07:08.079
Serena, Dan, hey.
This is Lexi.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.691
The ex? I was wondering
when I'd finally meet you.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.963
So, I-I know I probably
should've asked you sooner

07:22.050 --> 07:23.704
but how would you feel
about coming with me

07:23.791 --> 07:25.445
to the Snowflake Ball?

07:25.532 --> 07:28.317
Oh. Um..

07:28.404 --> 07:30.406
...I would love to

07:30.493 --> 07:32.626
but I don't-I don't think
it's a very good idea right now.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.715
Oh, you mean, you haven't
told Jenny about us?

07:36.717 --> 07:38.936
Look, I know you guys are close
and I'm the last person

07:39.023 --> 07:41.199
who'd want to come
between friends, but..

07:41.286 --> 07:43.680
...believe me,
Jenny doesn't care.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.116
I mean, she pretty much
blew me off.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.901
But what-what if she didn't?

07:46.988 --> 07:48.729
I mean, what if you found out
that she still liked you?

07:50.426 --> 07:51.862
I mean..

07:51.949 --> 07:54.648
Vanessa, I'm-I'm really
happy right now.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.302
Let's just go with this.
Please.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.395
- 'Okay.'
- 'Okay.'

08:03.483 --> 08:06.790
But...we're in "Gossip Girl"
country, so rein in your horses.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.052
Hmm, you're probably right.

08:08.139 --> 08:10.272
[laughs]

08:10.359 --> 08:12.666
So tell me. Whatever happened
between you and Nate?

08:13.841 --> 08:15.451
- I'm sorry?
- Please.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.671
Your kiss was
all over "Gossip Girl."

08:17.758 --> 08:19.542
And he was living here,
wasn't he?

08:19.629 --> 08:21.675
Uh...it..

08:21.762 --> 08:23.328
Uh, yeah,
for a little bit.

08:23.415 --> 08:26.114
Um...why do you care?

08:26.201 --> 08:28.159
Well, now that the Archibald
name is on the social rebound

08:28.246 --> 08:31.032
I was thinking
of asking Nate to the ball.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.077
So what's the story?

08:34.209 --> 08:35.819
Nothing. Um..

08:35.906 --> 08:37.517
Nothing even happened
between us, so..

08:37.604 --> 08:39.519
Well, I wouldn't
beat yourself up about it.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.043
I mean, you had to know
it was doomed from the start.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.786
He's Upper East Side,
and you're, well...here.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.530
[cell phones ringing]

08:54.751 --> 08:57.188
You've gotta be kidding me.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.190
Sorry ladies, for
those of you who were hoping

08:59.277 --> 09:01.279
to find Nate Archibald
under your tree

09:01.366 --> 09:02.803
looks like he's
already picked up

09:02.890 --> 09:04.326
his mistletoe mate.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.287
