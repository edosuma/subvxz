WEBVTT

00:05.040 --> 00:06.320
3, 4 and...

00:06.400 --> 00:08.640
I want to have a baby.
-I want to break up.

00:09.599 --> 00:13.320
The theater wants your play.
-What?

00:13.359 --> 00:15.320
You're a couple?
-No.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.120
Are you suggesting
I be your colleague?

00:18.199 --> 00:20.440
Her partner will be
the same as on TV,

00:20.480 --> 00:21.679
Ofer Marciano.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.480
I'm not signing,
I hate the theater!

00:24.519 --> 00:27.160
Everyone's wearing
mustaches and wigs!

00:27.280 --> 00:30.079
You'll want me back,
but I won't want you.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.439
Okay.
-I won't wait for you. -Okay.

00:32.479 --> 00:35.000
I hate her. -Oh yeah?
Then why did you kiss me?

00:35.079 --> 00:37.600
Big mistake! -It was a mistake
I ever met you. -Oh yeah?

00:37.679 --> 00:40.240
You're pretty, happy,
and you have money.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.079
You're not ready
for a dramatic lead role.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.159
God help me,
how will we tell him?

00:45.240 --> 00:47.479
Yuvi, I'll never leave Reut.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.159
Then what do you want from me?
-You're my lover.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.679
I'm such an idiot...

00:53.960 --> 00:57.079
Dovaleh agreed to come
and save us, he'll be our director.

00:57.159 --> 00:58.960
Let's see what
you've done so far.

00:59.039 --> 01:01.320
Assuming I'm not directing the play,

01:01.399 --> 01:03.119
and I'm not directing the play,

01:03.200 --> 01:05.480
I think I deserve
half of the writing credit.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.480
You really believe
that this play is half yours?

01:07.519 --> 01:08.599
No, it's not half mine,

01:08.680 --> 01:10.000
but I'm half of the play.

01:10.079 --> 01:13.079
I'm sorry, were you a couple?

01:20.359 --> 01:22.719
Don't you have gold shoes?

01:23.439 --> 01:25.959
No, I have these.
You don't like them?

01:26.040 --> 01:30.319
But won't everyone wear
gold or glass shoes to the ball?

01:30.400 --> 01:33.319
It's not a ball, Sara,
it's a premiere, it's...

01:33.439 --> 01:35.079
You watch the play,

01:35.159 --> 01:39.480
then there are cocktails,
and then lots and lots of talking.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.079
Then you stand in the middle

01:42.120 --> 01:45.640
and all the boys
want you.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.159
You refuse them all
by waving your hand, 'No, no'.

01:50.239 --> 01:55.319
Then you see the boy you want
to dance the romantic dance with.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.719
I know what dance
you should dance.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.159
There's no dancing at a premiere.
-Listen to me,

02:00.239 --> 02:03.680
I know what dance
will capture their hearts.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.439
Do what I do.

02:05.480 --> 02:08.439
I have to dance now?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.400
Well?
-Hand.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.479
Like this.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.000
I'm the boy, you're the girl.
-All right.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.719
Foot back.
Now back where it was.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.319
Your foot... no.
-Okay, okay.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.319
Okay.
-Now your other foot forward.

02:27.599 --> 02:30.120
Now back.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.000
Now turn around.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.439
Then walk back.

02:38.719 --> 02:40.680
Clap twice.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.439
Now go like this.

02:42.479 --> 02:45.280
No, like this.
-What am I doing wrong?

02:45.360 --> 02:47.719
Do it more...

02:48.360 --> 02:50.719
As if you're running, yes.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.080
Now go like this.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.719
Did your parents forget you
in the car, kid?

04:01.280 --> 04:02.479
Shit...

04:03.680 --> 04:06.159
Why are you in my car?

04:06.400 --> 04:09.080
I wanted to surprise you.
Shit.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.120
What's the surprise?
That you're in the car?

04:11.199 --> 04:12.680
No...

04:13.080 --> 04:16.160
I wanted to walk up to you
before you got here.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.319
Never mind.
Hold on.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.319
One sec.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.279
If you please.

04:25.519 --> 04:27.000
I...

04:27.079 --> 04:31.160
I want to be your chauffeur
for the premiere.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.000
You're coming to the premiere?

04:40.680 --> 04:43.480
Yes, get in.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.240
And you came to pick me up
in my own car?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.240
You've got style.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.720
Do you want to get in?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.680
Someone's coming to pick me up.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.480
When?

05:05.639 --> 05:08.319
Right about now.

05:09.079 --> 05:11.279
Gili or your mom?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.120
No.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.000
Someone.

05:16.439 --> 05:17.959
Who?

05:20.319 --> 05:22.079
A friend.

05:22.199 --> 05:24.000
Which friend?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.160
A friend of mine.

05:26.519 --> 05:29.079
A new friend?
A friend I know?

05:29.160 --> 05:31.079
A new friend of mine,
a friend.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.319
"A new friend of mine,
a friend."

05:33.439 --> 05:36.959
Okay, just say
you're seeing someone.

05:37.079 --> 05:39.480
I'm seeing someone.
-Okay.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.480
You're seeing someone?
Seeing-seeing?

05:42.519 --> 05:45.319
That was fast.
-It's just the beginning...

05:45.399 --> 05:49.959
it's our second date, I don't know.
Yes, yes. - Okay.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.639
You invited him to the premiere?

05:51.680 --> 05:54.560
A date to the premiere?

05:54.639 --> 05:57.399
I just thought it was...

05:57.519 --> 05:59.480
kind of cool and he...
-Okay...

05:59.519 --> 06:00.680
He was impressed and he likes...

06:00.959 --> 06:04.160
Am I supposed to ask you
who I can bring to the premiere?

06:04.240 --> 06:07.399
I wanted to invite him, it's...

06:07.480 --> 06:09.000
Okay.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.079
Excuse me.
-No problem.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.959
What? What?

06:21.040 --> 06:22.120
No...

06:22.199 --> 06:23.600
So far everything's going

06:23.680 --> 06:26.160
according to my plan.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.079
Tzutz.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.079
What?

06:37.480 --> 06:39.319
There are...

06:39.519 --> 06:42.279
all kinds of things
I want to tell you.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.319
But don't, okay?

06:44.439 --> 06:45.319
Let me, okay?

06:45.399 --> 06:48.680
No, no, no, please don't.

06:51.199 --> 06:52.079
Tzutz.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.480
Give it up.
-I...

06:53.519 --> 06:55.079
Really...
I'm asking you.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.120
Please let me.
-Don't say anything. -I...

06:57.199 --> 06:58.680
No, you'll ruin everything.
-I...

06:58.959 --> 07:01.560
Here's my friend,
here's my friend.

07:04.519 --> 07:08.120
-What's up?
-How are you? -Hi. -Great.

07:08.240 --> 07:12.480
-Oded, this is Tomer.
He's...

07:12.600 --> 07:14.639
Tomer is...

07:14.720 --> 07:18.120
my partner,
he wrote the play with me. -Cool.

07:18.199 --> 07:20.680
Congrats.
Come on, let's go.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.279
You coming with us?
-No, no.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.319
Come with us.
-Yeah, come with us.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.680
No, I have to drop by
my place first.

07:27.959 --> 07:29.079
I have to...

07:29.120 --> 07:30.079
I'll get the...

07:30.160 --> 07:32.279
what I need to get, so...

07:32.319 --> 07:35.600
-We have lots of time,
we'll drop by your place.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.720
Come on.
-I made something for the actors,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.240
I want to give it to them
before the play...

07:41.279 --> 07:45.279
I'll go to my place,
you guys go ahead. -Okay.

08:43.399 --> 08:46.159
Fuck! What the hell
happened here, buddy?

08:46.240 --> 08:50.440
Sorry, man,
I'm not feeling well.

08:51.039 --> 08:53.279
Osi, Osi.
-What, sweetie?

08:53.320 --> 08:56.320
The elastic is too tight.
-Let me see.

08:56.399 --> 08:58.600
It's fine, sweetie,
it's not too tight.

08:58.679 --> 09:01.080
Are you stressed
because of the premiere?

09:01.159 --> 09:03.480
No, it's too tight.
I'm not making this up.

09:03.519 --> 09:05.600
Look, sweetie,
my pants are tight, too,

09:05.679 --> 09:08.000
it just means
they're a good fit.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.639
Bye, sweetie, good luck.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.320
Hey, superstar.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.279
You do realize
the play depends entirely on you?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.440
Why do you have to say that?
-Why?

09:15.480 --> 09:17.279
Because the audience
is coming to see you!

09:17.399 --> 09:19.720
They don't care
if it's your first time on stage.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.320
That's the nature of audiences.
Indifferent.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.080
So show them
what you've got, okay?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.480
How do you feel?

09:26.559 --> 09:28.480
I'm fine, I'm okay, I...

09:28.519 --> 09:30.480
have a really bad stomachache.
-Good.

09:30.559 --> 09:33.159
If nothing hurts,
it would mean you're dead.

09:33.279 --> 09:36.320
Don't worry,
I was right to bet on you.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.480
What did you do, Vera?

09:42.559 --> 09:43.720
Now you'll be okay.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.279
Tell Osi to put a safety pin
on your pants.

09:47.399 --> 09:49.080
Because of the elastic band?

09:49.159 --> 09:53.080
To ward off the Evil Eye from
all the jealous people watching you.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.720
It's a must!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.080
Good luck, Ofka.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.399
Ofer, the audience is here
in 10 minutes. -Fine.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.480
Grab the groundhog
from the grass.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.679
Grab the groundhog from the grass.
-Listen, Maya.

10:07.720 --> 10:12.679
Larry sent the latter a letter later.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.320
Maya, listen.
-Later.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.960
Can't you see I'm warming up?
-Fine, never mind.

10:23.039 --> 10:27.720
Guys, I'm letting the audience in.
-Enough, we heard you!

10:31.600 --> 10:34.679
Hi, you've reached Yuvi,
I can't answer right now,

10:34.720 --> 10:36.279
if it's important,
call me back.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.320
If it's not important, leave me
a message and I probably won't hear it.

10:40.399 --> 10:42.679
I hope you have
a good excuse for disappearing,

10:42.960 --> 10:45.159
because I've never chased
anyone like this.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.399
Today is the premiere
on the stage with the boxes,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.559
which you said was
a metaphor for a garbage dump

10:49.639 --> 10:52.480
and I really hope you're coming
to make fun of me.

11:16.440 --> 11:20.320
Karina, hey.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.000
Hi, Tomer, how are you?
-I'm fine.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.320
I need a ticket.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.120
No, I'm sorry.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.480
What?

11:29.679 --> 11:30.679
No.

11:31.039 --> 11:32.320
I mean...

11:32.639 --> 11:34.399
No.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.480
What do you mean, no?

11:38.639 --> 11:40.679
There are no more freebies, sorry.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.320
What are you talking about, Karina?
I directed this play.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.720
I know, but I was explicitly told,
no more freebies.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.440
Are you kidding me?
Don't you think...

11:49.480 --> 11:53.320
this is an exception?

11:54.080 --> 11:57.080
You can talk to Vera.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.600
Vera?

11:59.080 --> 12:00.480
She's here.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.480
Could you...

12:02.600 --> 12:05.000
talk to Vera?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.600
No.

12:16.279 --> 12:19.320
Okay, fine.

12:24.559 --> 12:26.720
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.480
Good evening.
-Hi.

12:28.519 --> 12:30.080
What name is
your ticket booked under?

12:30.159 --> 12:32.720
I didn't book a ticket,
I want to buy one.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.559
I hope there are seats left.

12:34.639 --> 12:37.000
For 'One Plus One', right?
-Yes.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.240
Because 'Richard II'
is on tonight, too.

12:39.279 --> 12:41.159
No.
-It got a 5-star review.

12:41.279 --> 12:43.000
A modern contemporary classic.
-No, no,

12:43.080 --> 12:45.679
thank you.
'One Plus One'.

12:45.960 --> 12:50.240
A light comedy, 75 minutes,
no intermission. -That's right.

12:50.279 --> 12:54.000
Great. It's their premiere today,
it's exciting. -Oh yeah?

12:54.080 --> 12:56.320
110 shekels, please.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.159
110 shekels?

12:58.279 --> 13:00.559
You sell them for a 110 shekels?

13:01.159 --> 13:03.679
Do you have a membership card?
-No, no, okay.

13:03.720 --> 13:08.279
Are you a soldier or a student?
-No, just sell me the 45-dollar ticket.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.080
Thanks.

13:16.559 --> 13:17.720
Here you are.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.480
Enjoy.
-Thank you.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.080
Would you mind moving aside?

13:36.159 --> 13:39.320
Sure, sorry.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.080
Thank you.
Oh my god.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.000
I can't believe
how many people are here.

13:50.159 --> 13:52.720
Shall I get us some wine,
so you can get drunk?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.720
Should I?
-Totally.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.320
I brought candy
with noisy wrappers too.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.000
Good.
-You won't mind?

13:59.080 --> 14:01.279
-You look amazing,
I forgot to tell you.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.679
Excuse me, one sec.
-What? -I'll be right back.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.000
I'm sorry.
-No problem.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.960
Mom. -Then drive around
one more time. -Mom...

14:07.039 --> 14:10.080
It's on the left.
-Mom, what are you doing here?

14:10.159 --> 14:11.159
Oh, here she is!

14:11.279 --> 14:13.080
What happened to your mouth?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.639
Now it's dark red,
it'll go away.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.000
Explain to Nehama where it is,
she's lost.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.960
What?
Why is Nehama coming?

14:19.039 --> 14:20.480
She really wanted to see it,
how could I say no?

14:20.559 --> 14:22.480
You weren't supposed to come!
I explicitly said,

14:22.519 --> 14:24.720
I don't want anyone to come
to the first ten shows.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.279
Sweetie...

14:27.960 --> 14:30.279
Nehama, how are you?

14:30.320 --> 14:31.679
Thank you.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.240
Where are you coming from?

14:34.320 --> 14:37.960
Okay, then you're close,
just park in the parking lot.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.960
Park in the parking lot.
Parking lot. Okay.

14:42.039 --> 14:45.159
What a charming young man.
I can tell right away.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.320
How do you know I came with him?
-I saw you walk in.

14:48.399 --> 14:50.279
What's so charming about him?

14:50.320 --> 14:53.320
He's someone
we can start talking about.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.279
Okay.
-One sec.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.120
Yes, Mandy?

14:57.200 --> 14:58.279
In the parking lot.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.679
What's going on?
-They say to park in the parking lot.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.720
But you have a handicap sticker,
what's the problem?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.159
How many people did you invite?

15:04.240 --> 15:06.320
Then call Tziki, he'll explain.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.320
Tziki too...

15:07.399 --> 15:08.559
I don't have the patience.

15:08.639 --> 15:11.240
So will I have to get
on stage at the end?

15:11.279 --> 15:13.440
I was thinking about it
and I don't want to.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.480
Why would you have to get on stage?
Are you in the play?

15:15.600 --> 15:17.080
But maybe at the end,

15:17.120 --> 15:20.480
when you go up to thank me
and everyone else?

15:20.960 --> 15:21.960
Yes, you do.

15:22.039 --> 15:24.720
You and Nehama
and Tziki and Schpitzki,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.080
everyone.
-Why are you so upset?

15:26.120 --> 15:28.000
What did I do to you?
-What did you do to your mouth?

15:28.080 --> 15:31.279
Nehama told me to have them filled
for the premiere.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.639
You got Botox for the premiere,
are you nuts?

15:33.679 --> 15:35.080
And how many people
did you invite?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.399
What is this, my wedding?
-Yes.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.559
And I bought another ten tickets
for my close friends

15:40.639 --> 15:42.320
and I'm not asking you, okay?
-Okay.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.320
And I invited your brothers, too.

15:46.159 --> 15:49.399
Why? Why, Mom?
-Because, sweetheart, we came to watch.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.639
I asked you not to.
-Let me enjoy you sometimes too.

15:51.679 --> 15:56.480
You sit with your guy
and I'll sit with my friends. -Fine.

15:56.559 --> 15:58.679
And we'll see. -I don't know
why I invited him either...

15:58.720 --> 16:00.679
Here's our star!
-Hi.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.639
How are you?
-Don't run off at the end,

16:02.679 --> 16:05.240
I want you on stage with some flowers.
-All right.

16:05.279 --> 16:08.279
This is my mom.
Vera Korkin, CEO of the theater.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.320
Oh, here's the hen that laid the egg.
Nice to meet you.

16:12.399 --> 16:14.320
I'm the hen, hello.
-Listen,

16:14.399 --> 16:17.120
start saving up
for a nursing home,

16:17.200 --> 16:19.279
because you won't be seeing
any money from her.

16:19.320 --> 16:24.960
But maybe some pride.
-Maybe. -Here, have it framed.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.320
Look at all these people.
Who do we have here?

16:29.360 --> 16:31.679
Why did you give him credit?
-Because I wanted to.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.000
You just don't stop.
-Okay, Mom...

16:34.080 --> 16:35.720
You keep him too close.
-Fine.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
You'll break down again.
-Mom...

16:37.080 --> 16:39.120
You'll break down and cry.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.000
Hey, lady, listen to me.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.679
I gave him credit to keep him away,

16:42.720 --> 16:44.279
so he can take his credit
and move on.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.480
I'm in a different place.
-You're in the same place.

16:45.559 --> 16:47.320
I'm in a different place.
-You're in the exact same place.

16:47.399 --> 16:49.279
I'm in a different place,
I'm in a different place.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.000
I brought a different guy,

16:51.080 --> 16:52.480
did you see that?
-Yes. -Good.

16:52.559 --> 16:54.320
I won't break down again,
'cause no one will break me.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.000
And this guy won't pick me up either,
okay?

16:56.080 --> 16:58.279
I don't give a flying fuck
about either of them, okay? -Yes.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.559
Thank you.
Happy now?

16:59.639 --> 17:01.080
Yes. -Good,
now go to the box office,

17:01.120 --> 17:04.319
get your tickets, go inside,
sit down and wait for it to start.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.599
Answer Gedalia.
-You answer Gedalia.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.400
Enjoy.

17:09.519 --> 17:12.279
Hey, Gedalia.
Park in the parking lot.

17:12.519 --> 17:14.079
Cheers.
-Cheers.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.079
Is that your mom?
-Of course not.

17:23.359 --> 17:28.079
Don't be stressed, it's all good.
-I'm so nervous. -Sure.

17:28.599 --> 17:31.680
Listen, I have to go backstage
and talk to the actors.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.720
I'm sorry
I keep leaving you alone.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.480
I didn't think I'd be this busy.
-No...

17:35.599 --> 17:37.720
Are you sure it's okay I'm here?
-Of course.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.079
I can leave,
we can meet tomorrow.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.680
No way.
-Seriously, no hard feelings.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.599
No, of course not.
-Really? -Stay, stay.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.680
Okay, -Of course. -Okay.
-Stay right here. -I will.

17:53.559 --> 17:57.400
Ofer. -What?
What are you doing here?

17:57.480 --> 17:58.680
I came to see the play.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.400
Did I invite you?

18:00.480 --> 18:02.160
Do I need an invite from you?

18:02.279 --> 18:04.079
I've been working here
for a 100 years, dummy.

18:04.119 --> 18:06.319
No, I don't like this.
-Who's asking you?

18:06.359 --> 18:08.480
Come on, seriously,

18:08.559 --> 18:10.480
I won't stop thinking
about what you think,

18:10.559 --> 18:12.400
I can't handle this.
-What I think?

18:12.480 --> 18:14.440
What you think of me,
I won't stop thinking

18:14.480 --> 18:16.319
about that.
-What I think of you?

18:16.359 --> 18:19.079
Please, Shlomo,
don't stay for the play.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.000
What if I think,
here comes the little bastard

18:21.079 --> 18:24.160
who's going to steal
all my parts in the theater?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.279
They can all drop dead.

18:26.319 --> 18:28.440
Focus on your partner.

18:28.559 --> 18:30.599
Hey there.
-Oh, hello.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.240
Where is she?
-In her dressing room, where else?

18:33.279 --> 18:36.319
Right. Good luck.
-Thanks, man.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.599
You okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.680
First call, guys.

18:42.519 --> 18:46.279
Don't forget the safety pin.
-Don't be ridiculous.

18:46.319 --> 18:48.319
Please, God,
may the audience like me

18:48.440 --> 18:49.599
and may I be amazing.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.000
May everyone look at me.

18:53.440 --> 18:57.680
Hi, Buddha.
-What a beautiful bouquet, thank you.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.279
How are you, gorgeous?

19:00.319 --> 19:03.440
Stressed?
-No, not so bad. -Good.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.119
Who did you come with?

19:05.279 --> 19:07.160
My parents are here.

19:07.319 --> 19:08.680
None of your friends?

19:08.960 --> 19:09.599
No,

19:09.680 --> 19:11.480
no one could make it.

19:11.599 --> 19:14.079
You said Yuvi and Avivit
wanted to.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.680
Oh my god, Buddha,
I forgot to tell you. -What?

19:16.960 --> 19:19.599
Yuvi and Avivit got married.

19:20.319 --> 19:22.400
What?
-Can you believe that madman?

19:22.480 --> 19:25.079
They flew to Cyprus to get married.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.279
Isn't that crazy?

19:27.319 --> 19:29.480
I think our wedding
really affected him,

19:29.559 --> 19:32.279
even though he always said
he'd never get married.

19:32.319 --> 19:34.000
Don't you think?

19:34.680 --> 19:36.680
Yeah. -Buddha,
I know you hate him,

19:36.720 --> 19:38.079
but just so you know,

19:38.160 --> 19:40.640
he has really mellowed out..

19:40.680 --> 19:42.160
I don't know,

19:42.319 --> 19:44.079
it's like he has totally changed.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.599
He's been with Avivit
since he was 16,

19:45.680 --> 19:47.720
suddenly he's getting married?

19:50.319 --> 19:53.640
What's going on, Buddha?
What's wrong?

19:53.680 --> 19:55.319
Nothing, nothing.

19:55.359 --> 19:59.480
Why am I babbling on
right before you go on stage?

20:02.720 --> 20:06.319
I'm okay, it's okay, I...

20:07.440 --> 20:09.680
I'm just nervous
about the premiere,

20:09.720 --> 20:11.559
that's all.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.599
You'll be amazing.

20:14.559 --> 20:16.160
Right.

20:16.279 --> 20:18.000
I know.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.599
Good luck, gorgeous.

20:22.279 --> 20:27.240
Have fun.
I'll wait for you outside.

20:46.160 --> 20:49.279
Good luck, Mayinka.
Break a leg.

20:49.319 --> 20:51.119
What's wrong?

20:51.319 --> 20:53.079
Nothing.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.640
I don't know what happened,
but it's the first time

20:55.680 --> 20:59.160
you have the face
of a leading role.

21:00.079 --> 21:04.480
You're going to be great tonight.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.480
What's going on here?

21:16.640 --> 21:20.680
Ofer, the place is packed,
we're a hit!

21:33.119 --> 21:36.079
Do you need anything from me?

21:37.400 --> 21:42.720
Ofer...
-Can't you see I'm warming up?

21:47.279 --> 21:49.160
Iris.

22:00.440 --> 22:03.240
I don't want to disturb you,

22:03.279 --> 22:08.279
I just came to give you something
before the play.

22:10.039 --> 22:14.480
This stage is your home now,

22:14.680 --> 22:18.319
so it would be nice
to put it at the entrance.

22:18.359 --> 22:20.000
So you'll remember
it's your home

22:20.079 --> 22:24.279
and you can clean up any mess
before you go in.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.160
I'm...

22:26.240 --> 22:28.119
so grateful

22:28.240 --> 22:31.559
that you're the ones
moving in here.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.720
And when I think about
this whole process of ours,

22:36.039 --> 22:39.319
I wouldn't change a single thing
in this story.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.680
Not a thing.

22:41.079 --> 22:43.279
You're such a sweetheart.

22:43.319 --> 22:46.079
Good luck.
-Thanks, Iris.

22:46.279 --> 22:47.599
Break a leg.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.480
Is Tomer coming?

22:50.160 --> 22:53.319
I don't know.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.319
Hands.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.480
Come, let's hold hands.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.440
Hold hands.
-Okay.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.240
Can I join you?
I was part of the process, too.

23:04.279 --> 23:07.400
Of course, come on.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.440
Wait, let me fix that.
-What is it?

23:13.480 --> 23:15.680
What is it?
-That's it, you're good.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.160
What did you do?
-It's all good.

23:17.279 --> 23:19.480
Don't worry.
-I just fixed the tape.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.240
It keeps coming off...
-I fixed it.

23:21.279 --> 23:23.640
Are you all right?
-Yeah. -Okay.

23:23.680 --> 23:27.160
Soon this plane will be taking off...

23:27.279 --> 23:30.279
Lift your hands up in the air...

23:30.359 --> 23:33.440
You are the pilots.

23:34.440 --> 23:37.319
What? What?
-No, suddenly everyone...

23:37.400 --> 23:41.119
is getting all poetic.
It's okay, I'm sorry.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.559
Iris said it's our home,
you say it's a plane...

23:43.640 --> 23:46.319
Oh, well,
we each have different metaphors.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.079
I guess I wanted
to be a pilot.

23:49.319 --> 23:52.240
I wanted a home.
-That's obvious, Iris.

23:52.279 --> 23:54.480
Guys, five minutes to curtain.

23:54.519 --> 23:56.119
Don't forget,

23:56.240 --> 23:58.960
you are not on automatic pilot,

23:59.039 --> 24:01.480
you need to enjoy the view.

24:01.599 --> 24:05.960
And worst case, you have
a parachute in the event of a crash.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.599
What?

24:08.680 --> 24:11.440
Calm down. Calm down.
-I'm stressed,

24:11.480 --> 24:14.079
stop telling me to calm down.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.480
Come on!

24:16.559 --> 24:18.559
Laugh a little.

24:19.079 --> 24:21.680
Okay, hands in the middle.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.240
Good, very good.
Okay.

24:28.079 --> 24:31.119
Let's fuck 'em!

24:31.359 --> 24:32.440
What?

24:32.559 --> 24:34.119
You don't still say that?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.119
Isn't that what you yell?
-Yes, we do.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.240
We do.
-You do.

24:37.279 --> 24:39.400
I hope I don't get sued now.
-That's what you say? -Yes.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.960
Okay, then.
-All right.

24:42.039 --> 24:44.000
All right.

24:44.079 --> 24:46.160
Let's fuck 'em!

24:46.480 --> 24:47.279
Great.

24:50.599 --> 24:53.079
So what do you do professionally?

24:53.160 --> 24:53.960
Right now...

24:54.039 --> 24:56.319
Gedalia!
Here, here.

24:56.440 --> 25:01.079
This is Gedalia, we were
in the army together.

25:01.559 --> 25:04.000
Mom...
-Oh, here, I'll get up.

25:04.079 --> 25:08.720
Sit together.
-Thanks. Hi, Gedalia.

25:09.119 --> 25:11.680
Are the actors nervous?
-Very.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.400
Will you stay here
or will you have to get up in the middle?

25:14.480 --> 25:17.160
No, I want to see the play
like everyone else.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.960
Like a spy.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.480
Yes, like a spy.
-Hey, sis.

25:21.599 --> 25:23.640
You could've told me you were coming.
-Mom said it was okay.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.680
Mom said...
-Tomer's here too.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.319
Where?

25:27.680 --> 25:30.279
Over there.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.440
Okay.

25:35.519 --> 25:37.480
Oded, I'm sorry,
these are my brothers,

25:37.559 --> 25:39.480
Gili and Razi.
-Hey, what's up?

25:39.519 --> 25:41.599
This turned into a family evening.
-Nice to meet you.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.559
Nice to meet you.
Tomer's here.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.160
Leave her alone, bro.
-Okay...

25:46.279 --> 25:48.480
Did you know he's here?
-Stop it.

25:48.559 --> 25:50.279
Tomer you wrote the play with?

25:50.319 --> 25:53.440
Yes. -He left her,
so they're not together now.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.160
Really?
Yes, that happens.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.319
Right, so maybe
you'll be together now.

25:58.359 --> 26:00.319
But we're not sure.
-Yes, we don't know yet.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.680
Leave him alone, bro.
-We don't know yet.

26:05.319 --> 26:09.160
Gum? Gum, anyone?
-Mom... -Here.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.720
Tomer! Hey!

26:21.039 --> 26:24.480
Tomer. -Hey, Razi.
-How's it going? -Hi, Dalia.

26:24.559 --> 26:27.160
Hello.
Sorry, this seat is taken.

26:27.279 --> 26:30.160
Mom. -Don't 'Mom' me.
It's Nehama's.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.160
But Nehama's not here.
-She'll be here any minute.

26:32.279 --> 26:34.119
I don't want to have
to get up afterwards.

26:34.200 --> 26:39.000
I promise when we get to the bridge,
I'll get up for Nehama, okay?

26:39.079 --> 26:42.079
She'll be here any minute.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.599
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:43.680 --> 26:46.680
please take your seats.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.960
The play will be starting shortly.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.480
Dalia, do me a favor, I...

26:56.680 --> 26:58.279
Please move over,
I want to talk to Iris.

26:58.319 --> 27:00.319
Not interested.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.440
Dalia, do me a favor.

27:03.519 --> 27:05.720
Not interested.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.079
Tzutz, Tzutz.
-What?

27:14.160 --> 27:15.599
Why are you answering?
-Mom, leave me alone.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.240
Same place.
-Fine.

27:17.279 --> 27:18.720
Exactly the same place.
-All right.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.680
Tzutz.
-What?

27:23.039 --> 27:25.720
I don't want to work
with you anymore.

27:27.359 --> 27:30.160
I want to live with you.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.240
I want to come home.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.440
I love you.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.319
Should we trade places?

27:45.680 --> 27:47.440
No, no.
-No, of course not. -It's fine.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.480
It's not a problem.
-No, no.

27:48.599 --> 27:49.599
Tomer, you want to go back home?

27:49.680 --> 27:51.000
Don't interfere, bro.
-It's okay.

27:51.079 --> 27:52.400
He wants to go back home.
-No, he doesn't.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.279
No, he doesn't.
-No, he doesn't.

27:54.319 --> 27:56.119
See what you did?

27:56.200 --> 27:58.160
But he wants to go back home.
-NO, he doesn't, Razi.

27:58.279 --> 28:00.680
He's feeling emotional and confused,
that's all, okay?

28:00.960 --> 28:02.480
Mom, just for one sec.

28:02.559 --> 28:04.079
I'm not moving.
-For one sec.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.720
I'm not moving.

28:07.200 --> 28:11.279
Listen, we're at a climax right now,

28:11.319 --> 28:13.319
because of the premiere,
so you're feeling emotional,

28:13.359 --> 28:14.640
so you think it's love.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.319
It's not love,
it's a stage crush. -What?

28:17.480 --> 28:19.720
Stage crush,
it's a rush of adrenaline

28:20.000 --> 28:22.599
that makes you feel like you're in love.
-What are you, a social worker?

28:22.680 --> 28:25.720
Why do you always think
you know what I'm feeling?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.160
Most of the time I do
and you don't.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.240
But I do know,
I want to come home.

28:30.279 --> 28:31.480
She doesn't want him back?

28:31.559 --> 28:33.680
Razi, I don't...

28:33.960 --> 28:35.400
Let's talk after the play?

28:35.480 --> 28:36.720
I don't care about the play.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Do you care about anyone?

28:38.079 --> 28:39.240
Can you not interfere?

28:39.279 --> 28:41.160
It's not nice,
you brought a friend. -Okay...

28:41.279 --> 28:42.480
I can leave, it's okay.
-Listen...

28:42.599 --> 28:44.319
Maybe it would be best
if you left.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.319
No, Razi, of course not!
Just one second...

28:47.440 --> 28:50.160
Get up, move.
-I'm not moving. -Get up.

28:50.279 --> 28:52.279
Mom. -Get up.
I want to talk... get up!

28:52.319 --> 28:54.079
I'm not getting up!

28:54.200 --> 28:57.119
Sorry, I'm sorry.

29:00.079 --> 29:01.319
You want me
because you don't have me.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.319
Just like you only wanted Kasha
because she was leaving.

29:03.359 --> 29:05.480
Don't you know anything about yourself?
-I'm learning, I'm learning.

29:05.599 --> 29:09.480
Then come back once you've learned, okay?
Now let's be quiet,

29:09.599 --> 29:12.079
the play is about to begin.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.000
Oded.

29:18.319 --> 29:19.680
Oded...

29:20.119 --> 29:21.960
Oded?
-Yes.

29:22.240 --> 29:25.640
Is this important to you?
-Seriously? -What?

29:25.960 --> 29:28.279
Listen, I really don't want
to get involved

29:28.319 --> 29:31.599
in the story between you two.
-The thing is, this woman

29:31.680 --> 29:33.680
is the story of my life.
-All right...

29:33.960 --> 29:35.480
I don't know what your status is
in life.

29:35.559 --> 29:38.680
I'm divorced.
-Really? So am I. From her.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.319
Don't boast about being divorced,
you never bothered marrying her.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.000
We were together for five years.

29:43.079 --> 29:44.119
And I know now

29:44.200 --> 29:47.440
that I want to come back.
-How dare you say that you know?

29:47.480 --> 29:48.720
What do you think you know?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.079
You know
you won't feel suffocated?

29:50.119 --> 29:51.480
You know you won't want
a different perspective again?

29:51.519 --> 29:53.720
Do you know that you
won't get sick of me in a year?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.279
Do you know...
One second, Dalia.

29:55.319 --> 29:56.960
Do you know that you won't
want to sleep with other men?

29:57.039 --> 29:58.279
You bet I will.
-Of course.

29:58.319 --> 30:00.480
I'm sorry for talking like this.
-Of course you will.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.480
Want me to say ridiculous things?
No problem.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.400
I have no life without you.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.640
I have no reason to live
apart from you.

30:07.720 --> 30:10.240
You're the reason I breathe.
-Shut up.

30:10.279 --> 30:11.599
You're my oxygen.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.000
You're my reason for living.

30:18.119 --> 30:19.599
Well? Well?

30:19.680 --> 30:23.960
There isn't anything I can say now
that will... There isn't.

30:24.319 --> 30:27.319
Tzutz, listen, I think
you should settle for me.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.680
Tzutz?

30:28.720 --> 30:31.319
We'll go home,
we'll sit on our couch,

30:31.440 --> 30:33.319
we'll order food.

30:33.680 --> 30:38.319
I'm dying to settle for you.
I'm dying to!

30:39.240 --> 30:41.279
Oh, here's Nehama.

30:41.319 --> 30:44.079
Now what?

30:45.680 --> 30:47.400
You're sitting in my seat.
-Okay...

30:47.480 --> 30:49.440
Nehama, just sit down,
you're late anyway.

30:49.480 --> 30:53.279
Please turn off
your mobile devices.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.440
Thank you and enjoy the show.

30:55.480 --> 31:00.319
But he said he wanted to go back.
-Sshh, bro, they're starting.

31:01.599 --> 31:04.160
I said that I want to come back.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.440
That would be...

31:06.559 --> 31:08.279
very stupid of me.

31:08.319 --> 31:10.400
Then be a little stupid.

31:12.119 --> 31:14.279
I'm not stupid anymore.

31:14.480 --> 31:18.279
I'm sorry.
-She is stupid.

31:33.039 --> 31:36.160
Tzutz, look.

31:36.319 --> 31:38.480
Our own apartment.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.400
Tzutz.
-What?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.400
Our own apartment.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.480
What do you think?
-It's a good apartment.

31:54.559 --> 31:57.000
You think
we made a mistake?

32:01.359 --> 32:02.480
Tzutz.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.599
You think we made
a mistake, Tzutz?

32:13.960 --> 32:15.279
Tzutz?

32:18.240 --> 32:21.559
Tzutz, did you leave
something behind?

32:29.079 --> 32:33.480
Tzutz, I like the apartment
we chose.

32:36.359 --> 32:38.319
Tzutz, the keys.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.480
Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

32:40.519 --> 32:41.640
Excuse me.

32:45.319 --> 32:46.680
Just breathe, okay?

32:46.960 --> 32:49.160
Take nice even breaths, that's all.

32:49.279 --> 32:51.240
Inhale through your nose.

32:58.079 --> 33:02.000
What's going on?
-I think it's a panic attack.

33:02.279 --> 33:03.599
I'm sorry, I can't.
-Got any Xanax?

33:03.680 --> 33:06.160
I'll go get some water.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.400
Good evening, dear audience.

33:19.680 --> 33:23.079
We have a slight technical problem,
we'll continue shortly.

33:23.119 --> 33:26.000
In any case, I wanted to thank you
very much for coming.

33:26.079 --> 33:27.599
Raise your hand

33:27.720 --> 33:31.400
if you paid full price
for your ticket.

33:33.160 --> 33:36.400
Let's hear it for today's chump!

33:39.519 --> 33:44.319
They're getting a free performance
by Shlomo, so don't worry.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.480
I didn't swallow it.
-Just swallow it.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.279
Ofer, sweetie, look at me.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.680
There's no one there.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.119
Understand?
-Yes.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.640
Just a bunch of old fogies
from the suburbs.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.079
Who cares about them?

33:57.119 --> 33:59.279
I ruined everything, huh?
-Of course not. -I ruined everything.

33:59.319 --> 34:00.480
You made their day.

34:00.559 --> 34:03.119
They'll have a story to tell their friends,
no one cares about the play,

34:03.200 --> 34:06.119
it's no big deal.
-I can't breathe.

34:06.240 --> 34:09.400
What happened?
What's going on?

34:09.679 --> 34:11.679
One sec.
-I want to know what's wrong.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.159
It's an actors' thing.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.159
Talking about lights,

34:16.320 --> 34:19.440
I'll never forget,
in the middle of 'Waiting for Godot',

34:19.679 --> 34:21.480
boom, one of them fell on me.

34:21.599 --> 34:24.480
We waited and waited, Godot never came,
but the ambulance did.

34:24.599 --> 34:26.480
I'm coming to grovel.
-Dovaleh.

34:26.519 --> 34:28.000
I really don't understand.
-Dovaleh...

34:28.079 --> 34:30.559
I ruined everything,
I can't believe it.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.000
Look at me, look at me.

34:33.079 --> 34:35.679
Are you with me? Come on,
let's go back. -No way,

34:35.960 --> 34:37.599
I can't, Tomer.
-Leave him.

34:37.679 --> 34:39.320
No, no, no, I can't.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.320
Come on.
-I'll die out there.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.119
You won't die.
-I'll die. -Come on.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.119
I can't, I can't.
-Yes, you can.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.599
You've got to do today's play.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.079
Just today, okay?

34:49.159 --> 34:51.320
Be terrible, be lousy,
don't be funny, don't be good,

34:51.400 --> 34:54.280
don't be talented, I don't care,
but you have to do it, okay?

34:54.320 --> 34:55.400
We'll replace you tomorrow.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.960
I'll die out there.
-Then die.

34:57.039 --> 35:00.320
Choke and suffocate and die.
So what?

35:00.400 --> 35:03.280
What if I don't remember the text?

35:03.360 --> 35:06.719
Okay, listen, listen.
I...

35:07.079 --> 35:11.079
I'll stand here during the whole play

35:11.119 --> 35:13.960
and Iris will stand on the other side,
okay? -Yes.

35:14.039 --> 35:15.400
Okay.
-Come on.

35:15.559 --> 35:19.000
We know
the whole play by heart.

35:19.079 --> 35:20.320
The whole thing, okay?

35:20.360 --> 35:23.320
If you need help,
look at me or at Iris,

35:23.400 --> 35:25.440
okay?
And we'll give you the text.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.679
And if you need to get
a glass of water or a hug,

35:27.960 --> 35:29.079
that can work too.

35:29.119 --> 35:32.599
Sure, I love being alone on stage.

35:35.079 --> 35:37.280
Wait.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.599
Shit, Ofer.

35:48.159 --> 35:50.679
Is the elastic too tight?

35:55.320 --> 35:59.119
I told my son,
'Come see the play.'

35:59.280 --> 36:04.119
He said, 'Forget it, Dad,
the theater's dead.'

36:05.280 --> 36:08.960
Yet what's happening here is
as alive as it gets.

36:09.079 --> 36:15.320
and you're the first to discover
this wonderful, magical thing.

36:15.480 --> 36:18.480
I'm alive!
-Oh! Unbelievable.

36:18.559 --> 36:19.719
One came back to life.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.280
Applause.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.719
Ladies and gentlemen...
-You know what helped him?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.599
The Xanax.
-Of course. -Of course.

36:33.679 --> 36:38.280
...to start again
the play 'One Plus One'.

36:38.679 --> 36:41.719
Give a lot of love
to two young actors

36:42.000 --> 36:44.320
who are the future of Israeli theater.
-There's Reut.

36:44.440 --> 36:50.159
Maya Gutman and Ofer Marciano!

36:51.280 --> 36:54.599
I don't think I love him.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.119
That's okay.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.400
I'm going to the other side.
-Okay. Tzutz...

37:01.079 --> 37:02.320
What?

37:02.599 --> 37:04.239
What do you say?

37:04.320 --> 37:05.480
About what?

37:05.559 --> 37:08.119
Will you settle for me?

37:11.480 --> 37:13.480
You jerk.

37:22.639 --> 37:25.079
Ready?
-Yes.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.480
Let's go.
-Rub your feet.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.239
Right foot forward.

37:33.639 --> 37:36.440
Gimme a kiss.

37:49.480 --> 37:52.119
Tzutz, look.

37:53.079 --> 37:56.599
What?
-Our own apartment.

37:58.079 --> 38:00.280
What do you think?

38:02.119 --> 38:06.440
Yeah, it's ours.
It's a good apartment.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.320
You think we made a mistake?

38:09.480 --> 38:11.280
About the apartment?

38:11.360 --> 38:13.719
About moving in together.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.280
Do you regret it?

38:17.039 --> 38:20.280
No, do you?

38:21.280 --> 38:23.000
Yes.

38:23.079 --> 38:25.480
What?
-I'm used to living alone.

38:25.559 --> 38:26.480
Listen,

38:26.599 --> 38:30.079
we're like roommates
who sleep together.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.559
I can relate to that.
-Then let's mark our territory.

38:33.639 --> 38:36.079
Okay, what should I do?
Pee around a little?

38:36.159 --> 38:37.480
No, but we need a constitution,

38:37.519 --> 38:39.960
let's make some rules.

38:40.079 --> 38:41.480
Rule number one -

38:41.559 --> 38:44.440
If you encounter
one of my shirts on the floor,

38:44.480 --> 38:46.119
don't touch it.

38:46.199 --> 38:49.599
There's thought behind it,
I'm the only one who can move it.

38:49.679 --> 38:52.320
Whoever doesn't change
the toilet paper roll

38:52.440 --> 38:55.320
is to blame for whatever happens to him.
-If anyone suspects that the milk

38:55.400 --> 38:57.119
has expired, throw it away

38:57.199 --> 38:59.599
before the other one drinks it.

38:59.679 --> 39:03.000
Hair may clog the shower drain
from time to time,

39:03.079 --> 39:05.320
don't panic, dude,
it'll be taken care of.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.679
No one is calling me 'dude'
in this house.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.280
Why not? It's funny.
-I don't think so.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.079
Agreed.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.559
What now?

39:12.679 --> 39:14.480
We put things away.
-After that?

39:14.559 --> 39:16.480
We live here.

39:17.039 --> 39:20.079
Two, three and...
