WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:08.808
We are delighted
for you to be our
first audience

00:08.809 --> 00:10.343
since we got together again.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.612
You know, we...
we haven't been able to
play together

00:12.613 --> 00:15.448
for a long, long time,
and this is the time,

00:15.449 --> 00:18.651
so, please, you know,
forgive our errors.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.787
We have a little bit
of rough edges.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.980
Bradford Sharp.
This is my first movie.

01:53.981 --> 01:57.083
My very first one.
We're shooting on film.
Kinda nervous.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.452
Uh, it's untitled.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.354
And just remember,
everybody, just be natural,

02:01.355 --> 02:03.391
be realistic, be in the moment.

02:05.893 --> 02:09.929
Are you excited to play
after time away?

02:09.930 --> 02:11.731
Uh, yeah.
I'm really excited.

02:11.732 --> 02:15.568
I am also very curious about
where we're playing,

02:15.569 --> 02:18.871
because knowing Rodrigo,
it's probably
pretty interesting.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.208
What do you love about the oboe?

02:21.209 --> 02:22.742
What do I love about the oboe?

02:22.743 --> 02:24.544
I don't really know
what I love about
the oboe anymore,

02:24.545 --> 02:27.079
except that I know
that I do love it.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.882
You know that the oboe
actually, like, symbolizes

02:29.883 --> 02:32.419
the sound of love and...

02:32.420 --> 02:36.256
Not like romantic love,
but I think love in general.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.858
- Okay, Warren Boyd.
- Yeah?

02:38.859 --> 02:43.630
Here. This one's for you.
All the way to the back.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.899
- Huh.
- And, uh, Union Bob.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.402
Have you played this?
I did it in Sweden and
it's, uh...

02:49.403 --> 02:52.539
- I don't know. Yeah.
- It's pretty, um...

02:52.540 --> 02:54.241
- It's kind of crazy.
- It's crazy?

02:54.242 --> 02:56.075
- Yeah.
- This is the first time
you've played together

02:56.076 --> 02:59.412
in quite some time.
I'm curious to know
what you...

02:59.413 --> 03:00.713
What you feel like right now?

03:00.714 --> 03:03.082
Well, I can't wait.
I mean... Huh.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.253
I... I've been dying
for the last four months,
or however long it's been.

03:06.254 --> 03:09.256
I'm happy that I get to, um...

03:09.257 --> 03:13.493
To sub, and...
right now it feels good.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.994
How long will your film be?

03:14.995 --> 03:19.131
You know, right now
I don't like to talk about

03:19.132 --> 03:20.467
my work when it's happening,

03:20.468 --> 03:22.302
uh, but I just want to
be with you guys.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.804
It could be...
It's really up to you guys
how long it is.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.739
What instrument are you
the most jealous of?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.441
What instrument am I
the most jealous of?

03:28.442 --> 03:30.042
Like what you'd like to have
the skill playing.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.780
Um, Dee Dee.
I'm j... For him.
The percussion.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.349
What does it take
to be a good percussionist?

03:36.350 --> 03:40.353
You really have to love
what time can do.

03:40.354 --> 03:43.956
You know, you can either
play it on the beat,

03:43.957 --> 03:46.993
behind the beat,
in front of the beat.

03:46.994 --> 03:51.364
And what's interesting is
all different conductors

03:51.365 --> 03:54.033
want time placed differently.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.402
What, we're here?

03:55.403 --> 03:56.770
This is where we're going?

03:59.407 --> 04:01.308
Yo. We're going to jail.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.675
No, no.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.345
All right, let's get off
the bus real quick.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.446
I'm not even surprised.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.315
What the hell?

04:08.316 --> 04:10.450
So, guys, we're gonna
get onto that bus
that is over there,

04:10.451 --> 04:12.752
the white one, and
we're in a bit of
a hurry, okay?

04:12.753 --> 04:15.488
So none of your usual,
you know, thingies,

04:15.489 --> 04:17.123
ten-minute break
and everything.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.059
Okay,
you guys heard the maestro.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.662
Very fast, please, guys.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.598
Let's get down low here,
I want to get down low.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.134
The Maestro,
totally unpredictable.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.036
I had no idea where
we were gonna go.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.939
And then when Bob
saw the sign to Rikers,

04:32.940 --> 04:36.108
I thought, oh, right.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.711
Why didn't I realize this
to begin with?

04:38.712 --> 04:43.149
I mean, a classic
Rodrigo move, right?

04:43.150 --> 04:47.620
Rodrigo had just returned to us,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.889
and this was his idea.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.959
I thought it was unconventional,

04:52.960 --> 04:55.995
but that's very much Rodrigo,
and that's why I love him.

04:55.996 --> 05:00.600
So I thought, well,
let's give it a shot.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.968
I wanted to encourage Rodrigo

05:01.969 --> 05:03.670
because he had just come back,

05:03.671 --> 05:06.373
so I thought let's...
Let's give it a shot.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.008
Has a orchestra of this size...

05:09.009 --> 05:10.843
Don't film me.
Actually, do film me

05:10.844 --> 05:12.244
in case I want it for later
just to have...

05:12.245 --> 05:13.580
I don't know if I'm gonna be...

05:13.581 --> 05:15.014
What kind of documentary
this is gonna be yet,

05:15.015 --> 05:16.749
if I'm gonna be off camera
or on camera,

05:16.750 --> 05:18.551
so we get one of both, each.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.453
Maybe we get one of each.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.589
Better to have
extra fabric in the legs
and then take the pants in,

05:22.590 --> 05:24.290
you know what I'm sayin'?

05:24.291 --> 05:28.561
Um, has an orchestra
of this size ever, uh,
played, uh,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.997
in this facility before?

05:30.998 --> 05:33.132
- No, this is the first time...
- Not of this size.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.934
This is the first time
we've had an orchestra,

05:34.935 --> 05:37.404
um, perform for
the inmate population

05:37.405 --> 05:39.138
in, uh, Rikers Island.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.310
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

05:44.311 --> 05:47.814
you have now reached
Rikers Island security
check point.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.115
Uh, once you get off the bus,

05:49.116 --> 05:50.917
you will be given
further instructions

05:50.918 --> 05:55.254
on, uh, clearing
the security check point.
Okay?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.727
All right, people, listen up.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.963
Penal law 305.25
is a D felony.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.865
Anyone caught with
contraband will get arrested.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.967
We do not discriminate here
in Rikers Island.

06:07.968 --> 06:11.538
No cell phones, no tobacco,
no electronic equipment.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.678
I didn't know
where we were going,

06:18.679 --> 06:21.180
and, uh, frankly, I didn't care.

06:21.181 --> 06:25.718
I trusted it was gonna be
some musical experience,

06:25.719 --> 06:27.987
and I was cool with that.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.926
We walked up and there's...

06:33.927 --> 06:35.762
You know, there's Manhattan,
the skyline,

06:35.763 --> 06:38.197
and... and then there's
the fencing.

06:38.198 --> 06:41.469
It was kind of a...
It had a weird
beauty to it.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.859
To listen to music

07:06.860 --> 07:09.529
is definitely, uh...
Is a right.

07:09.530 --> 07:13.666
You know? Um,
and to make music,
therefore, but...

07:13.667 --> 07:16.869
Is to listen to
this type of music,
I think, it is a right.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.071
I think it is
something that, uh...

07:19.072 --> 07:21.841
That anyone should be allowed to

07:21.842 --> 07:23.743
because the thing
that gives you peace,

07:23.744 --> 07:26.513
even if peace is not allowed

07:26.514 --> 07:28.948
into... into your world.

07:28.949 --> 07:35.522
Music is the biggest,
uh, common denominator.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.524
We're looking for reasons why to

07:37.525 --> 07:39.058
keep on playing as an orchestra.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.860
Go up to the skyline,
then come back,

07:40.861 --> 07:42.629
but make it look like
you still care about
what he's saying.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.796
...I think we're gonna
find something here,

07:43.797 --> 07:45.297
which I don't know
what it's gonna be,

07:45.298 --> 07:47.834
but it's only doing it that
we're gonna find out

07:47.835 --> 07:49.335
the real reason why we're here.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.803
Nice.

07:50.804 --> 07:54.173
As all things good,
it is gonna be reciprocate.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.942
They're gonna
give it back to us,

07:55.943 --> 07:58.244
and they're gonna give us, um...

07:58.245 --> 07:59.679
a way of, um...

07:59.680 --> 08:01.814
You know,
a-a reason of why to-to...

08:01.815 --> 08:02.983
To do what we do.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.423
Are you nervous?

08:11.424 --> 08:13.159
Yeah.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.195
Yeah, kind of...

08:16.196 --> 08:17.997
nervous, but at the same time,

08:17.998 --> 08:21.100
it's gonna be perhaps
one of the...

08:21.101 --> 08:23.804
best audiences
we're ever gonna have.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.708
Well,
what we're gonna play today

08:28.709 --> 08:31.679
is little pieces from
the same composer.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.616
He fought in the
second World War,

08:36.616 --> 08:38.116
when he was taken prisoner.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.821
And most of his most
important prominent works,

08:41.822 --> 08:44.757
come when the time that
he was in the prison camp.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.993
In the beginning, I didn't
know what was going on,

08:46.994 --> 08:48.995
but then I saw the orchestra,
and I said,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.496
I don't like that kind of stuff.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.966
So I just sat down,
and for the first time
in my life,

08:53.967 --> 08:58.938
I enjoyed it because
it's something...

08:58.939 --> 09:00.940
Something I experienced for
the first time in my life.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.609
I never experienced
something like that.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.110
Never heard, really,
music like that.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.045
Even though I
lived in New York
my whole life,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.880
never went to no concert
like that, nothin',

09:07.881 --> 09:09.515
so it was an experience.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.652
I just closed my eyes
and I was letting
the instruments

09:12.653 --> 09:13.986
just come to me,

09:13.987 --> 09:16.088
and I just felt free
like that, you know?

09:16.089 --> 09:18.490
It was just...
It was just...

09:18.491 --> 09:20.126
a different type of feeling.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.428
Like you could say
I was in, like, a trance.

09:22.429 --> 09:26.032
Like, I was here physically,
but emotionally and spiritually,

09:26.033 --> 09:27.701
like, I was, you know, gone.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.382
Okay.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.285
So, Messiaen,
he used all his senses

10:53.286 --> 10:55.722
when he was imprisoned
to escape.

10:55.723 --> 11:01.127
He believed that, uh...
that the music gives
the power to fly.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.194
He loved birds,

11:02.195 --> 11:04.630
and amongst them was
the nightingale.

11:12.472 --> 11:17.509
Okay, well,
he wrote a piece
for the nightingale.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.080
This is a bird that
sings at night only.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.482
So basically,
this bird you cannot see,

11:23.483 --> 11:25.484
but you can listen.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.921
A little bit like God.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.446
Ondes Martenot interview,
take one.

12:28.615 --> 12:29.648
It's pronounced...

12:29.649 --> 12:31.050
"Ond Marten-oh."

12:31.051 --> 12:33.853
The last name Martenot was
the name of the inventor?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.721
That's right,
the engineer who built it.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.956
What does Ondes mean?

12:36.957 --> 12:38.825
Ondes means wave.

12:38.826 --> 12:39.859
So wave and then his name.

12:39.860 --> 12:40.893
Yeah, his wave.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.737
I always imagined that
I would play this instrument
in a jail.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.841
- Really?
- Yes, because it was...

12:54.842 --> 12:57.309
born out of
such a utopic vision,

12:57.310 --> 13:00.412
and then it's the one sound
that Messiaen took with him

13:00.413 --> 13:01.580
when he went to prison.

15:00.767 --> 15:04.736
Messiaen was very sure
that at the end,
love conquered all,

15:04.737 --> 15:06.772
and that hope was there.

15:06.773 --> 15:11.243
He wrote this piece
straight after he
came out of prison.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.980
So here's the ending.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.478
See, I... I always...
I always wanted to go
to see an orchestra,

19:06.479 --> 19:09.981
a symphony orchestra.
I mean, to take my girl out
and black tie and everything.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.518
It's my first time
being there in an orchestra,

19:12.519 --> 19:14.653
and it was...
It was an experience.

19:14.654 --> 19:18.290
And it was, uh, nice.
It was a beautiful experience.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.227
I've never before
saw an orchestra play

19:21.228 --> 19:23.229
until yesterday.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.763
And it was magnificent, man.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.098
I can't describe it,
it was like...

19:27.099 --> 19:28.268
my hair is rising up.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.102
It was incredibly memorable

19:31.103 --> 19:34.973
to see how they would,
like, close their eyes,

19:34.974 --> 19:36.808
and they would just
listen to the music.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.844
It was incredible.
It was...

19:38.845 --> 19:41.647
That's gonna stay with me,
watching them

19:41.648 --> 19:45.451
listen to the music,
and letting themselves go.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.118
It... I just...
I could zone now.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.855
Just see my...
It just makes me
think about my family.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.258
Peace of mind, you know?

19:52.259 --> 19:55.894
Tranquility,
I could just really
fall asleep to it,

19:55.895 --> 19:58.230
have good dreams to it.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.998
Just peaceful,
basically, for real.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.268
You know, I had my mind in
a lot of different places.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.436
Some... Like, sometimes
I went dark,

20:04.437 --> 20:05.437
sometimes I went happy.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.674
Life, death. Freedom.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.076
The feelings that
got dark was positive.
You know?

20:11.077 --> 20:13.312
Nothing was negative
about that experience.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.347
I found myself smiling a lot,

20:15.348 --> 20:17.048
and I found myself lost,

20:17.049 --> 20:18.950
you know, just hearing
a lot of the sound.

20:18.951 --> 20:22.621
You know,
it's just hard to
just let yourself go

20:22.622 --> 20:24.523
the way you really
want to, but, yeah,

20:24.524 --> 20:27.125
it bring a lot of feeling
and, you know,

20:27.126 --> 20:31.162
and, yeah, it...
I... I was in touch
with myself.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.500
This is gonna be a
one time in a lifetime
thing, right?

20:34.501 --> 20:36.902
Wonderful. Beautiful.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.304
I enjoyed it.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.071
Beautiful.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.609
It took me away
from where I'm at,
definitely did.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.677
You know, it...
It made me think a lot,

20:45.678 --> 20:49.481
and as the birds were flying,
it was a very beautiful day.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.182
Even when I went out to
the yard today,

20:51.183 --> 20:52.551
I went out earlier, you know,

20:52.552 --> 20:54.853
I went around and did
my little work out,

20:54.854 --> 20:56.755
and I seen, I said, wow,
everything is gone,

20:56.756 --> 20:58.724
like, yesterday,
everything was there,

20:58.725 --> 21:01.660
and then today everything's
just gone just like that.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.462
I said, wow,
but I could still imagine,

21:03.463 --> 21:05.030
like, seeing everything
in my head.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.433
Everything was
just there yesterday,

21:07.434 --> 21:09.468
and... and it was so...
So...

21:09.469 --> 21:12.471
The vibe was just so
brilliant. It's great.

21:36.262 --> 21:39.197
When we share these
very intense experiences,

21:39.198 --> 21:42.701
and I think what...
What's interesting is that

21:42.702 --> 21:44.436
the family aspect came together

21:44.437 --> 21:47.473
by the fact that all of our
different experiences

21:47.474 --> 21:49.107
were being played at that time.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.676
We had no time to prepare.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.944
Um, we rehearsed very little.

21:52.945 --> 21:57.282
So when we got
our experiences of not
being with each other

21:57.283 --> 22:00.486
so in that sense,
it's like a family reunion.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.491
I feel at peace again.

22:05.492 --> 22:10.128
That we're...
finally have things humming
the way it should be again,

22:10.129 --> 22:13.765
and we're... we have...
We're whole,

22:13.766 --> 22:17.002
and we have a future.
