Good Morning Corpus Christi!  This is Jimmy J. Judge
voice of the Texas Riviera.

00:48.570 --> 00:52.570
They say, 'Some like it hot' -- well some of you
are going to burn today.

01:15.570 --> 01:16.570
I'm coming!

01:17.570 --> 01:20.570
-Hurry! I don't want to be late!
-Why is it always so hot?

01:41.570 --> 01:44.570
Woo!  Woohoo! Yeah!  Hey look at her!

01:51.570 --> 01:53.570
Come on baby!

01:54.570 --> 01:55.570
-Hello who this!
-Eleanor.

01:56.570 --> 01:59.570
Ok, Eleanor you're on the air!  Now tell it to the
Judge.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.570
-I love you Jimmy J!
-Well That makes two of us, Eleanor.

02:03.570 --> 02:08.570
-Line 3, you're on the air.
-This Dave. Where can I get some shade man?
 Sun is too much!

02:09.570 --> 02:12.570
Just crawl back under that rock.  HAHAHA!  I'm
kidding, Dave.  You always got a friend in court.

02:13.570 --> 02:14.570
Line 2, tell it to the Judge!

02:55.570 --> 02:57.570
-You get vanilla?
-No. They ran out of it.

03:00.570 --> 03:04.570
-Strawberry?  You bought strawberry?
-Binx don't you ever get tired of vanilla?

03:13.570 --> 03:15.570
Hey, Binx how about a piece of tail?

03:20.570 --> 03:22.570
Mmm, taste good.

03:24.570 --> 03:27.570
-Get your hand of that!
-Off what?  Your sister or your fagmobile?

03:34.570 --> 03:38.570
Ooo wee! Right in his face!

03:49.570 --> 03:52.570
-You better check it out first.
-Why? I'm hot.

03:53.570 --> 03:56.570
-The alligators.
-Well I can handle alligators.

04:09.570 --> 04:11.570
You're not fooling anymore.

04:22.570 --> 04:24.570
Billie Jean?

04:33.570 --> 04:40.570
-Billie Jean!  Billie Jean!
-Looking for me.  HA!
-You are going to get it.

04:50.570 --> 04:52.570
-Billie Jean?
-Hmm?

04:53.570 --> 04:55.570
-Tell me about Vermont?
-Again?

04:56.570 --> 05:01.570
-Never gets hot?
-How many times you have to hear this?
It gets hot but not like this.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.570
I know.  Clean hot.

05:04.570 --> 05:11.570
Green mountain state.  Got leaves that turn colors
and snow in the winter time.

05:12.570 --> 05:18.570
-Long cabins!  Ski lifts!  Snow prowls!  Snowballs!
-How come I have such a weird brother?

05:19.570 --> 05:25.570
- Snowball fights!
- And no alligators.

05:50.570 --> 05:52.570
Hey!  Leave it!

05:54.570 --> 05:58.570
Come on, Hubie, now it's not a toy!

06:00.570 --> 06:02.570
He's dead.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.570
Hey.

06:28.570 --> 06:31.570
Look, Hubie, I'm real sorry all right.
He didn't mean nothing by it.

06:32.570 --> 06:35.570
Leave it, fart-face!

06:46.570 --> 06:48.570
No. Don't!

06:52.570 --> 06:55.570
-The bastard.
-Don't worry we'll get it back.

07:04.570 --> 07:06.570
Spent all that money and
now here you are brokenhearted.

07:06.570 --> 07:09.570
Wasn't his fault.

07:09.570 --> 07:12.570
Fault doesn't matter.
It's what you end up with is what matters.

07:12.570 --> 07:14.570
-'Member what happened to your daddy.
-Oh mom, come on.

07:15.570 --> 07:20.570
Loved to go fast just like you.  I'm relieved that
darn bike is gone.  Are you gon' eat those?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.570
-Oh that's him.  Where's my pumps?
-What time you coming home?

07:26.570 --> 07:29.570
Late I hope.

07:29.570 --> 07:31.570
You think this one will be different, Billie Jean?

07:37.570 --> 07:39.570
Oh he looks nice.

07:40.570 --> 07:43.570
Let him see your eyes.  You got pretty eyes.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.570
Now, Binx, don't you worry honey.

08:00.570 --> 08:06.570
-He won't bring it back.  Not Hubie Pyatt.
-Yes he will.  He's just getting even.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.570
Eat your supper.

08:16.570 --> 08:19.570
He better not hurt that bike.
He better not even scratch it.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.570
What did I ya.

08:37.570 --> 08:40.570
I'm getting my bike back.

08:41.570 --> 08:44.570
Come back here.  Binx!  Come back here!

08:50.570 --> 08:54.570
-Look at those tits.
-I think they're gross.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.570
That's cause you don't have any.
Why carry them?  You think I want to look like that.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.570
Wouldn't hurt.

09:04.570 --> 09:09.570
-Get the keys to the car!  We gonna go!
-How far my dad needs it.

09:14.570 --> 09:19.570
-The police station.  Now hurry up!
-Where's Binx?  Did he get in trouble?

09:20.570 --> 09:24.570
What did he do?  Can I come, Billie Jean?
I just love police stations.

09:25.570 --> 09:26.570
I thought you were grounded.

09:27.570 --> 09:29.570
I am.

09:40.570 --> 09:43.570
Did you see that guy?
Come on!  Move it!

09:49.570 --> 09:53.570
Well, I think it's best to wait a day or two before
I complicate things.

09:55.570 --> 09:57.570
You don't know my brother.  That scooter is his
whole life.

10:01.570 --> 10:08.570
Billie jean. You're a very pretty girl.  This Hubie
was probably just trying to get your attention.

10:09.570 --> 10:12.570
I have a feeling he'll bring your brother's
motor scooter back.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.570
What kind was it?

10:17.570 --> 10:19.570
Honda Elite.

10:20.570 --> 10:23.570
-My dad left him some insurance money.
-Hubie won't bring back.

10:24.570 --> 10:28.570
-How do you know?
-Cause he's a fucker that's how I know.

10:30.570 --> 10:32.570
She always talks like that.

10:33.570 --> 10:40.570
Well, I'll tell you what I do.  Here's my card.  If
that Honda isn't back on your lawn in two days
you'll give me --

10:41.570 --> 10:43.570
We live in Breeze Haven.

10:44.570 --> 10:50.570
All right in front of your trailer then.
Give me a call.

10:51.570 --> 10:53.570
We'll, um, drag in the fucker.

11:08.570 --> 11:13.570
Well she's still up.  Am be grounded til I'm 35
years old.

11:29.570 --> 11:32.570
Where have you been?  You go to that room and shut
that door.

11:32.570 --> 11:34.570
Ow!

11:34.570 --> 11:36.570
You are grounded, goddamnit!

11:37.570 --> 11:40.570
Thanks Ophelia.  I'll call you.

12:21.570 --> 12:24.570
-Oh Binx!
-I'm all right.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.570
Did Hubie Pyatt do this?

12:33.570 --> 12:36.570
Well I got my bike back!

12:42.570 --> 12:44.570
Hang on I see a spot!

12:50.570 --> 12:51.570
I'm amazing.

12:52.570 --> 12:53.570
-Hey guys wait here.  It won't take very long.
-I'm coming with you.

12:54.570 --> 12:55.570
No you're not!

12:56.570 --> 12:58.570
Oh, hi, Ophelia.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.570
-You think he's cute?
-She thought Hubie Pyatt was cute.  Let's go!

13:01.570 --> 13:03.570
No!  You're staying here.  Watch him, Ophelia.

13:04.570 --> 13:05.570
What?  Oh.

13:12.570 --> 13:17.570
Hubie, that's for you.
It's an estimate from the body shop.

13:19.570 --> 13:21.570
-For what?
-For my brother's scooter.

13:22.570 --> 13:26.570
$608 dollars.
parts, labor, paint, and tax.

13:27.570 --> 13:31.570
-You're out of your mind.
-The bill is for scooter.

13:32.570 --> 13:34.570
And this is for Binx....

13:36.570 --> 13:38.570
You crazy bitch!

13:40.570 --> 13:42.570
Hello folks?  How are you, young lady?
Hubie?  Where are you, boy?

13:43.570 --> 13:44.570
-Mr. Pyatt?
-Yes, ma'am.

13:45.570 --> 13:50.570
-Dad...
-What are you doing down there?

13:51.570 --> 13:54.570
Mr. Pyatt, I'm here to collect $608 dollars.

13:54.570 --> 13:58.570
Your son, Hubie, trashed my brother's scooter and
that's what it will cost to get it fixed.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.570
Get up, dummy.

14:04.570 --> 14:07.570
-Did she do this to you?
-She's lying, dad!

14:07.570 --> 14:09.570
It's the truth and he knows it.

14:09.570 --> 14:10.570
Come on.  Let's go.

14:13.570 --> 14:17.570
Boy it's never a dull moment around here.  You'll
have to come back soon and see what happens next.

14:17.570 --> 14:18.570
Yeah, sure.

14:21.570 --> 14:26.570
-Looks like we got a difference of opinion, don't we?
-Don't believe her, dad, she's from the trailers.

14:26.570 --> 14:28.570
-Oh yeah!  What's that got to do with it?
-She'll say anything!

14:28.570 --> 14:30.570
Woah, hey, slow down, Hubie.

14:30.570 --> 14:34.570
You look a bit under the weather.  Why don't you get
some fresh air?  It'll do some good.

14:34.570 --> 14:35.570
Just throw her out, dad!

14:35.570 --> 14:41.570
Boy... making too much noise.  I'll settle this. Take a hike.

14:45.570 --> 14:48.570
Damn, bitch... ruined my life.

14:53.570 --> 14:58.570
Hubie and the truth, have a natural way of not
getting along together.

14:59.570 --> 15:00.570
How much you say you got coming?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.570
$608 dollars.

15:06.570 --> 15:09.570
Yep, sounds like Hubie.

15:11.570 --> 15:16.570
Well don't keep that cash
here in the register.  Come on up.

15:22.570 --> 15:25.570
Come on.  Want the money don't you?

15:39.570 --> 15:43.570
You know lotta folks wouldn't pay this bill.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.570
-Your word against my son's.
-Well I'm telling you the truth.

15:48.570 --> 15:52.570
I'll believe you.  No matter where you live.

15:54.570 --> 15:55.570
You Donna Davy's little girl are you?

15:56.570 --> 15:57.570
Oh you know my mother?

15:57.570 --> 16:05.570
Yeah, well, I see her in the store.  She's a good-
looking woman, your momma.

16:06.570 --> 16:15.570
You show do take after her.  This looks real good on
you.  I bet you drive them boys crazy.

16:16.570 --> 16:22.570
-Oh, come on, Mr. Pyatt.
-You had ol' Hubie with his paws sticking straight up there.

16:24.570 --> 16:26.570
With your little smile.  Your little teeth.

16:26.570 --> 16:31.570
-I got friends waiting outside.  Can I please have
the money, Mr. Pyatt?
-Sure.

16:37.570 --> 16:43.570
-There you go.
-$50?
-We're gonna have a little arrangement...

16:43.570 --> 16:45.570
-Let go of me.

16:50.570 --> 17:02.570
-"The layaway plan."
-No.  No.  Stop!
-I'm going to give you $50 dollars today and
everytime you come back... I'm gonna get me a little
bit more.

17:04.569 --> 17:11.569
-No...NO!
-Woah, woah, relax.  It's too hot to get excited.

17:13.569 --> 17:18.569
- It pays, you go.
- NO!

17:20.569 --> 17:24.569
-Billie Jean!
-She didn't get the money I knew it.

17:29.570 --> 17:35.570
-You can't just take it!
-Hey, look at what I found.

17:35.570 --> 17:36.570
NO!

17:43.570 --> 17:46.570
-What the hell is going on here?
-Hey, let go of my sister.

17:48.570 --> 17:52.570
-You put that gun down, boy.  You do as I say.
-You get the money?

17:52.570 --> 17:55.570
-No, put the gun down, Binx.
-What he do to you, Billie Jean?

17:55.570 --> 17:58.570
-Hubie?  Call the police.
-Huh?

17:58.570 --> 18:02.570
They come here to rob the store.  Your little
girlfriend suckered me upstairs so her friends could
empty the register.

18:02.570 --> 18:06.570
-That's a lie.  Let go of me.
-Get on the phone, Hubie!

18:06.570 --> 18:10.570
Nobody moves. You let her go and give us the money.

18:10.570 --> 18:15.570
-We'll get it later let's just get out of here.
-You're not going anywhere!  Get on the phone, Hubie.

18:15.570 --> 18:16.570
He's got the gun, dad?

18:17.570 --> 18:20.570
So what.  It's not even loaded.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.570
You think I'll keep a loaded gun in the cash
register.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.570
It's empty?

18:36.570 --> 18:39.570
-Dad!
-Jesus.
-Oh my god.  I'm getting out of here.

18:39.570 --> 18:41.570
-He killed him.
-He said it wasn't loaded.

18:41.570 --> 18:45.570
-Don't even touch him.  I'm calling the police.
-Come on.

18:59.570 --> 19:03.570
You heard what he said; he said it wasn't loaded.
I didn't mean to shoot him!

19:03.570 --> 19:05.570
We got to go to the police.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.570
They'll never believe you.

19:07.570 --> 19:08.570
It was an accident!

19:08.570 --> 19:12.570
You think you'll say that?  It's his word against a
bunch of crazy kids.  He's gonna lie.

19:12.570 --> 19:15.570
Why didn't you stay in the car!

19:19.570 --> 19:24.570
-What are you doing?
-I need gas.  My dad checks the
gage everytime he comes home.

19:24.570 --> 19:26.570
Are you out of your mind!  Keep going!

19:48.570 --> 19:53.570
Hey guys!  Did you get it?

19:53.570 --> 19:58.570
-Move it.  I'll write a note to mom.
-Where's your money?
-Up in my closet!

20:12.570 --> 20:15.570
-Far out!  I'm coming!
-Forget it.  This is serious.

20:15.570 --> 20:19.570
I can be serious, Billie Jean.  I can't stay here
without you.  I'll just die.

20:19.570 --> 20:20.570
Go away, Putter.

20:22.570 --> 20:25.570
Billie Jean said I could come.  Don't move!

20:26.570 --> 20:29.570
Coming to you LIVE! and direct from the scene of the shooting.  Police have not yet made a statement, JJ.

20:29.570 --> 20:36.570
But C-101 has learned they have a good description of the assailants.  An all points bulletin is already an effect.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.570
And an arrest should be expected soon.

20:38.570 --> 20:42.570
Thank you Ed Saunders.  Back to you on the hour.
Before then if any other news breaks.

20:42.570 --> 20:47.570
This is Jimmy J. Judge of the Texas Riviera.
You peel'em, we deal'em.

21:20.570 --> 21:24.570
Where's your stuff?

21:26.570 --> 21:29.570
-I'll drive you anywhere you want.
-That'll be great.

21:29.570 --> 21:33.570
Okay!  I'm ready!

21:39.570 --> 21:41.570
-Where you think you're going?
-With you.

21:41.570 --> 21:44.570
-It's all right.  I'll drive her back with me.
-No way!

22:01.570 --> 22:03.570
He pointed them out.  Here.

22:05.570 --> 22:07.570
This one.

22:10.570 --> 22:13.570
This his sister.

22:15.570 --> 22:21.570
Goddamn.  I think I blew this one.

22:33.570 --> 22:35.570
You're name wouldn't Hubie, would it?

22:35.570 --> 22:37.570
Yes Sir, that'll be me.  Hubie Pyatt.

22:40.570 --> 22:42.570
Must be all shook up about what happened.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.570
Oh, yes, sir.  I guess I am.

22:44.570 --> 22:50.570
Hey, Let's talk about something else.  Let's talk
about -- motor scooters.

22:57.570 --> 22:58.570
But I love miniature golf.  Please can I stay with
you?

22:58.570 --> 23:05.570
Putter, you can do us more good back home.  Can be
my eyes and ears.

23:05.570 --> 23:10.570
-Hey, you know you'll be interviewed on the radio?
-What about TV?

23:10.570 --> 23:14.570
-Sure.  Live and direct.
-Really!

23:15.570 --> 23:17.570
You guys be careful, ok?

23:17.570 --> 23:19.570
Come on now.  Move it!

23:27.570 --> 23:30.570
If you don't let me out -- I'm throwing up all over
the front sit.

23:38.570 --> 23:40.570
Bye-Bye!

24:26.570 --> 24:28.570
Oh!

24:30.570 --> 24:33.570
I was part of it, Billie Jean.  I was there too.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.570
Would you hold it, you idiot! I'm not in the car.

24:50.570 --> 24:54.570
Good morning, Corpus Christi!  It's
another sizzler coming up!

24:54.570 --> 24:57.570
This is Jimmy J. Judge, voice of the Texas Riviera.

24:58.570 --> 24:59.570
-Who's on Line 1?
-This is Al.

24:59.570 --> 25:04.570
What are they going to do about these kids --
Walk into a store and gun a man down?

25:04.570 --> 25:07.570
We going to put them where they belong, Al.  You
don't have worry about that.

25:07.570 --> 25:12.570
I don't see them behind bars yet.  If there is going
to be a man hunt, they better cover the whole state.

25:12.570 --> 25:15.570
Why don't we go to Vermont?
They'll never find us there!

25:15.570 --> 25:18.570
We don't have enough gas to get out of Corpus.

25:18.570 --> 25:21.570
Then we'll steal it.  We're outlaws!

25:21.570 --> 25:24.570
No stealing.
We maybe the outlaws, but we're not the crooks.

25:24.570 --> 25:27.570
I'm a hungry outlaw.  Where's breakfast?

25:28.570 --> 25:32.570
They got pancakes in Vermont.
Real maple syrup from a tree.

25:32.570 --> 25:36.570
Stop thinking about your stomach!
Think about Mr. Pyatt.  What if he's dead!

25:56.570 --> 25:58.570
Putter, what are you doing?

25:58.570 --> 25:59.570
Please mom never let's me buy anything.

25:59.570 --> 26:01.570
We can't afford all that.

26:04.570 --> 26:06.570
No we don't steal.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.570
What's with them?

26:13.570 --> 26:16.570
-Beats me don't look at them.

26:18.570 --> 26:23.570
-Are you Billie Jean?
-No.  No, not me.
-Isn't that you?

26:26.570 --> 26:28.570
That's from the yearbook!  She took the best picture
in the class.

26:28.570 --> 26:29.570
It's them!

26:29.570 --> 26:32.570
It was an accident.  We never robbed anybody.

26:33.570 --> 26:37.570
-I told you.
-Well, don't maybe they're blaming you anyways.

26:37.570 --> 26:41.570
You know, you'll never sneak all that food out of
here.

26:41.570 --> 26:42.570
Putter.

26:48.570 --> 26:52.570
Just put this on my dad's bill, ok.
That's us outside.

26:58.570 --> 27:02.570
-Well thanks.  We really appreciate it.
-Can I have your autograph?

27:03.570 --> 27:06.570
-Josh, Jennifer, come on.
-Please?

27:07.570 --> 27:09.570
We'll all right then.

27:09.570 --> 27:10.570
Hey let's go.

27:12.570 --> 27:15.570
My dad says you're going to end up dead.

27:17.570 --> 27:22.570
'The victim was taken to Shoreline Hospital.   Where
his condition was listed as good.'
Did you hear that? Good, Not fair!

27:23.570 --> 27:24.570
Not critical!

27:24.570 --> 27:25.570
He's not dead!

27:25.570 --> 27:27.570
Yeah!

27:30.570 --> 27:34.570
Hold on, baby, hold on.

27:37.570 --> 27:40.570
-This is Lt. Ringwald.
Billie Jean, I'll like to help you?

27:42.570 --> 27:44.570
I asked for your help.  Remember?

27:44.570 --> 27:46.570
I'd been thinking about what happened...

27:49.570 --> 27:55.570
-And we're going to turn ourselves in.
-That's great.  You're a wise girl Billie Jean.

27:55.570 --> 27:59.570
But I want the $608 and I want
Mr. Pyatt to give it to me.

28:00.570 --> 28:02.570
Is that absolutely necessary?

28:02.570 --> 28:04.570
He owes it to us.

28:04.570 --> 28:05.570
Billie Jean!

28:06.570 --> 28:10.570
I'll meet you at noon tomorrow.  At Oceanpark Mall
near the fountain.

28:13.570 --> 28:15.570
That's great.  I'll make all the arrangements.

28:15.570 --> 28:17.570
And that's all we want.
Fair is fair.

28:33.570 --> 28:35.570
I got shot!  And you want me to pay for it?

28:35.570 --> 28:38.570
I'm not paying a goddamn red cent to those little
bastards!

28:38.570 --> 28:41.570
I lost two pints of blood.  I want them in jail.

28:42.570 --> 28:46.570
-Your son busted the boy's motor scooter.
-I'll let them sue me from the penitentiary.

28:46.570 --> 28:47.570
Dad!

28:48.570 --> 28:52.570
-Is that picture in the window for sell?
-No! Why?

28:52.570 --> 28:53.570
We'd like to buy it.

28:55.570 --> 28:58.570
-I'll give you $5 bucks for it.
-We got $7.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.570
-$8.50.
-$16.50.

29:00.570 --> 29:05.570
That picture is $10 dollars.  I'll sell it to you as
is.  If you wait for a frame it'll be $12.50.

29:05.570 --> 29:07.570
Sold American!

29:07.570 --> 29:09.570
Hubie, go roll it up for him.

29:10.570 --> 29:13.570
Don't you worry girls.  We'll have plenty more where
that came from.

29:13.570 --> 29:14.570
We got some coming in full color.

29:14.570 --> 29:18.570
You won't pay her. But you'll sell her picture.

29:20.570 --> 29:24.570
You damn right.  Maybe I can make a little something
out of this.

29:24.570 --> 29:28.570
You want one, Lieutenant?  I'll give you one.

29:30.570 --> 29:31.570
Half-price.

29:40.570 --> 29:44.570
You are ruining everything!  We haven't left Texas.

29:44.570 --> 29:45.570
Suppose their fooling us?

29:45.570 --> 29:47.570
You'll see.  They'll give us play money.

29:47.570 --> 29:51.570
Hey let's take a vote.  Majority rules.

29:51.570 --> 29:52.570
No vote. I've decided.

29:52.570 --> 29:55.570
-Suppose if--
-We're getting the money.

29:55.570 --> 29:56.570
That's what this is all about.

29:56.570 --> 29:58.570
Besides we have a plan don't we?

30:43.570 --> 30:44.570
Come on, Binx?

30:59.570 --> 31:02.570
-How much you make a year, Lieutenant?
-Enough.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.570
You gotta be out of your mind using your own money.

31:05.570 --> 31:09.570
-You can't afford $608 dollars.
-That's my business, Mr.Pyatt.

31:09.570 --> 31:13.570
-Well if it is, Why don't you give it to her then?
-She wants it from you.

31:14.570 --> 31:17.570
Yeah. You a sucker, you know that.

31:21.570 --> 31:25.570
I see them.  They got Mr. Pyatt with them.  Got an
envelope with those guys.

31:25.570 --> 31:29.570
-You sure it's the money?
-I'm going to find out right now.

31:29.570 --> 31:30.570
Wish me luck.

31:31.570 --> 31:34.570
Ok, 10-4.  Rodger over and out.

31:39.570 --> 31:41.570
What really went on in your store, Mr. Pyatt?

31:58.570 --> 32:00.570
Pretty girl isn't she, Mr. Pyatt?

32:09.570 --> 32:12.570
You think you made a deal?

32:13.570 --> 32:19.570
You made a mistake.
The cops aren't going to help you.

32:24.570 --> 32:27.570
You would've loved it Missy.

32:35.570 --> 32:36.570
Hubie!

32:47.570 --> 32:48.570
OH!

32:51.570 --> 32:54.570
Get her!  Get her!  Get her!

33:00.570 --> 33:02.570
You dumb son of a bitch!

33:40.570 --> 33:42.570
-I'm scared.
-Keep that door open.

34:23.570 --> 34:27.570
-Wait!
-Freeze!

34:27.570 --> 34:34.570
-Son put down that gun.
There's no one here to hurt you.
-Binx get in!

34:45.570 --> 34:48.570
Tell me, young man, What happened here today?

34:48.570 --> 34:50.570
well these men were chasing the girl right over
here.

34:50.570 --> 34:55.570
And then she splashed through fountain.  And racked
this man down the escalator.

34:56.570 --> 35:00.570
-What do you think about this Billie Jean?
-She's a rebel.

35:00.570 --> 35:07.570
Personally I think their picking on her cause she's
a girl.  And I think that's disgusting.

35:07.570 --> 35:10.570
Well there you have a woman's perspective.

35:10.570 --> 35:14.570
I thought it was awesome.  Billie Jean went running
up that escalator right there.

35:14.570 --> 35:17.570
This guy grabbed her by her backpack and she turned
around and kicked him right in the nuts.

35:17.570 --> 35:22.570
And kept running, it was hilarious!  Billie Jean wherever you are I love you.

35:27.570 --> 35:34.570
...Nothing in her background suggests violent and unlawful streak exhibited in this peaceful and attractive young woman.

35:34.570 --> 35:37.570
Now subject to a statewide man hunt. The mystery
remains--

35:38.570 --> 35:40.570
Oh my god.

35:42.570 --> 35:44.570
...Corpus Christi ask you to call the crime
stoppers number.

35:44.570 --> 35:45.570
Freeze!

35:50.570 --> 35:52.570
-Stop Binx!  You hear me?  Just stop it!

35:52.570 --> 35:57.570
-Did you see that guy freeze?
I had the drop on him.
-Beat your butt!

35:57.570 --> 36:01.570
That guy was a policeman.  Thought this gun was
real--he'd really killed you.

36:01.570 --> 36:05.570
-We were on TV! You should had seen it!
-We on the news.

36:06.570 --> 36:09.570
-This is supper?
-All we had left was 78 cent.

36:09.570 --> 36:16.570
Let's go to Vermont.  We could live in the woods.
Eat plants and leaves and stuff.  Go hunting.

36:16.570 --> 36:21.570
-Wait til my dad sees this.
-Who says your dad is going to see it?

36:21.570 --> 36:23.570
He'll see it when we go home.

36:30.570 --> 36:34.570
-Look at that one.  God!
-I bet it looks cool in there.

36:34.570 --> 36:36.570
I bet there's food in there.

36:41.570 --> 36:43.570
-Stop the car.
-What for?

36:43.570 --> 36:45.570
-That one looks empty.
-So.

37:15.570 --> 37:19.570
-What's this?
-I think it's chicken.

37:19.570 --> 37:25.570
-It don't taste like chicken.
-When you're rich food isn't suppose to taste like what it is.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.570
AHH!

39:19.570 --> 39:21.570
What you do that for?

39:29.570 --> 39:33.570
-I almost choked.
-Who told you going around scaring people?

39:47.570 --> 39:49.570
You didn't have to hit me.

39:55.570 --> 39:56.570
You live here?

39:58.570 --> 40:06.570
Yeah just me... and my dad.  He's in Dallas.  Then
it's Raymone, Gloria -- who work for us.

40:06.570 --> 40:10.570
But... they're out for the night.

40:13.570 --> 40:17.570
-You couldn't have came at a better time.
-For what?

40:21.570 --> 40:27.570
-Want to be a star?
-You're weird.
-You're Billie Jean.

40:28.570 --> 40:32.570
Hey, Billie Jean.  Billie Jean, TV, we're on TV.

40:33.570 --> 40:36.570
-Holy shit.
-Well hello...

40:37.570 --> 40:40.570
-Hey who is he?
-He lives here?  What's your name?

40:40.570 --> 40:42.570
-Lloyd.
-He knows who we are.

40:46.570 --> 40:49.570
-You're a dead man, Lloyd.
-We're missing the news!

40:50.570 --> 40:55.570
I'm not going to lie.  It was personal with me. And
I decided to take personal action.

40:55.570 --> 41:00.570
I don't think there is a father in this country who
wouldn't have felt the same way.

41:00.570 --> 41:04.570
-Look who it is.
-That sucker.

41:04.570 --> 41:10.570
I got a teenager myself and no one has to tell me
what this younger generation is all about.

41:10.570 --> 41:16.570
-These kids are playing games with the law.
-Change the channel.  Who wants to hear this?

41:16.570 --> 41:19.570
-I do.
-You like anything that's on the TV.

41:20.570 --> 41:24.570
While there were no shot fired.  The gang head north
from here in a late model Sudan...

41:24.570 --> 41:26.570
Late model I wish.

41:26.570 --> 41:30.570
...And reportedly robbed a truck stop on the boarded
community of Juliet.

41:32.570 --> 41:34.570
I love it.  We're everywhere.

41:34.570 --> 41:37.570
...Yeah, sure they had guns that's how they got me
tied up.

41:37.570 --> 41:38.570
Liar!

41:38.570 --> 41:42.570
...And they broke up the register and cleaned it
out.  Took $427.

41:42.570 --> 41:45.570
-Great now we're thieves.
-Probably took it himself.

41:46.570 --> 41:52.570
Was there anything said during the harass?
Just words.  Profanity.  Vile words.  They were all
bombed out of their minds.

41:52.570 --> 41:56.570
-Bastards!  They're all bunch of liars.
-I told you.

41:56.570 --> 42:01.570
-How can they say things like that?
-They can say anything.  We're in news now.

42:01.570 --> 42:02.570
'I cannot live.'

42:02.570 --> 42:05.570
Is that a boy or a girl?

42:05.570 --> 42:17.570
'I was crying through the frost.  Blessed church
bells, send my voices to me on the wind.'

42:17.570 --> 42:20.570
It's a girl.  Joan of Arc.

42:22.570 --> 42:26.570
She dressed up as a man all the French followed her
to fight the English.

42:27.570 --> 42:32.570
-Did she win?
-Yeah and no.

42:33.570 --> 42:47.570
She started to hear voices.  'Stop being a peasant,
be a soldier.  France needs you.  Truth. Justice.'

42:48.570 --> 42:52.570
And she won.  She beat the English.

42:54.570 --> 42:56.570
-And then...
-Then what?

42:56.570 --> 43:00.570
The French burned her -- ALIVE!

43:07.570 --> 43:12.570
-Come on in.  Water.
-All right!

44:26.570 --> 44:29.570
-Lloyd, you make videotapes?
-All the time.

44:29.570 --> 44:32.570
-What about copies?
-As many as you want.

44:34.570 --> 44:37.570
You are absolutely right!  What a great idea.

44:37.570 --> 44:39.570
What's such a great idea?

44:39.570 --> 44:44.570
Your sister is going to answer them and send copies
to all the TV stations.  Am I right?

44:44.570 --> 44:45.570
Oh, come on.

44:46.570 --> 44:48.570
-Where's your bathroom?
-It's upstairs.

44:49.570 --> 44:51.570
Set up your camera.  I'll be right out.

44:53.570 --> 44:56.570
She nervous so she has to pee.

45:12.570 --> 45:13.570
Move a little to your left.

45:13.570 --> 45:19.570
-Hello everybody!
-Binx?  Binx?  You're in the way.

45:20.570 --> 45:24.570
-Are those uppers or downers?
-For asthma.  You want one.

45:24.570 --> 45:27.570
-Really?
-Which one looks best?

45:27.570 --> 45:29.570
Oh my god.

45:44.570 --> 45:47.570
Wow.

46:11.570 --> 46:15.570
-Billie Jean...you look...
-Famous.

46:16.570 --> 46:17.570
Saint Joan.

46:25.570 --> 46:26.570
Turn the camera on.

46:30.570 --> 46:33.570
I'm Billie Jean Davy.
I want to set the record straight.

46:37.570 --> 46:42.570
-Binx!  They’re saying goodbye.
-They don't have to take forever.

46:43.570 --> 46:47.570
You could stay for awhile.
My dad won't be back for another week.

46:47.570 --> 46:51.570
-We'll just get you into trouble.
-Who cares.

46:53.570 --> 46:55.570
-You're sweet.
-But weird.

46:56.570 --> 46:59.570
You're not as weird as you think you are.

47:03.570 --> 47:05.570
Lloyd's cute, huh, Billie J?

47:05.570 --> 47:07.570
He gave this to you?

47:07.570 --> 47:12.570
-Far out.
-That's what I call making an impression.

47:12.570 --> 47:18.570
-Woah.  Wait up!  Tapes are not going to be enough.
-What do you mean?

47:20.570 --> 47:23.570
I mean their still going to have to give you the
money.  They'll just hunt you down and catch you.

47:23.570 --> 47:25.570
Can't you see that?

47:25.570 --> 47:28.570
Cops don't have to bargain with you.  You don't have
anything they want.

47:30.570 --> 47:35.570
I got a solution for you.  A trade.

47:35.570 --> 47:40.570
-Whatever is that boy doing?
-It's a trick.  I saw it on TV.

47:40.570 --> 47:43.570
-What kind of trade?
-I'm going to be your hostage.

47:45.570 --> 47:48.570
Now wait.  What are you talking about?

47:49.570 --> 47:52.570
Then they have to negotiate.  I'm your guarantee.

47:52.570 --> 47:57.570
-Like when you buy a car?
-That's warranty.

47:58.570 --> 48:00.570
Why you doing this?

48:01.570 --> 48:02.570
Hey someone's here!

48:02.570 --> 48:04.570
It's Raymome and Gloria.  Quick.  Take me.  I'm
yours.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.570
Who gave you this?

49:11.570 --> 49:13.570
She's on the air!

49:21.570 --> 49:25.570
I'm Billie Jean Davy.
I want to set the record straight...

49:26.570 --> 49:28.570
-Oh my god.
-Wow.

49:28.570 --> 49:33.570
I'm not a liar, I'm not a thief,
and neither is my brother.

49:33.570 --> 49:34.570
Hello ma!

49:34.570 --> 49:35.570
Sorry that is him.

49:36.570 --> 49:46.570
Mom, I don't know when we'll be coming home, but we
love you.  I know people are making up stories about
us.  Don't you believe them.

49:46.570 --> 49:50.570
As for you Mr. Pyatt, you are so sleazy!

49:52.570 --> 49:59.570
You think you can do anything you want and lie about
it and we just have to take it!  Because what are we
a bunch of kids.

50:00.570 --> 50:03.570
Well not this time.  From now on we're doing this
our way.

50:03.570 --> 50:05.570
No lying.  No cheating.  Fair is fair!

50:07.570 --> 50:12.570
$608 for the scooter your son trashed.
That's what you owe and we're not turning ourselves
in til we get it.

50:12.570 --> 50:17.570
Fair is fair!  We didn't start this.  We didn't mean
for this to happen, but we're not giving this up til
you pay.

50:17.570 --> 50:19.570
Fair is Fair!

50:34.570 --> 50:40.570
-Lt. Ringwald?
-Now what?
-We got a hostage.

50:59.570 --> 51:01.570
District attorney is here.

51:11.570 --> 51:13.570
Sorry about what happened, Mr Muldaur.

51:13.570 --> 51:14.570
We'll get him back.

51:16.570 --> 51:21.570
-You think he was kidnapped?
-Don't you?
-You can never tell what that boy is going to do.

51:22.570 --> 51:25.570
-You see this girl on tv?
-Me and half the country.

51:27.570 --> 51:30.570
Doesn't look like a kidnapping.  Looks like a party.

51:30.570 --> 51:34.570
I think it was.  I think this was a bunch of kids
having a fine ol'time.

51:34.570 --> 51:37.570
What about that gun they pulled on you?
Fun and games?

51:37.570 --> 51:41.570
I been thinking about that gun.
I'm not sure it was real.

51:41.570 --> 51:46.570
A toy store reported a few items was stolen.
They left I.O.Us.

51:47.570 --> 51:54.570
-The kid got the drop on you with a toy gun?
-Yes sir.  I believe he did.

51:57.570 --> 51:59.570
I would had liked to seen that.

52:00.570 --> 52:06.570
These kids are smart.  Got the wire service
interested. Got the networks interested.

52:06.570 --> 52:09.570
Got to give them a lot of credit.

52:11.570 --> 52:13.570
My son and I don't get along real well.

52:15.570 --> 52:18.570
I'm running for attorney general
and he knows he can screw me.

52:18.570 --> 52:26.570
Please, dad, do whatever they say.
These are some heavy duty criminals.  Oh god.

52:28.570 --> 52:30.570
Are we going to do this thing or what?

52:33.570 --> 52:35.570
Listen, this is your idea be serious.

52:40.570 --> 52:46.570
Daddy, just remember, if you get somebody's ear in
the mail -- it's mine.

52:48.570 --> 52:50.570
You guys are really boring.

52:50.570 --> 52:53.570
Hey listen to this?

52:53.570 --> 53:01.570
Listen to Billie Jean!  C'mon down to the
C-101 in beautiful Corpus Christi and collect
yourself on a brand new Yamaha courtesy of Douglas
Motorcycles on North Avenue.

53:02.570 --> 53:06.570
Fair is fair!

53:06.570 --> 53:10.570
-Did you hear that?
-A Yamaha?  Are you serious?

53:10.570 --> 53:12.570
Hey!

53:16.570 --> 53:19.570
We're rich!  We are so rich!

53:22.570 --> 53:26.570
-He's worth $10,000.
-From your dad?

53:27.570 --> 53:29.570
Only 10.

53:30.570 --> 53:32.570
Wow, straight-As.

53:33.570 --> 53:35.570
President of the Drama Club.

53:37.570 --> 53:43.570
-You're father is the district attorney?
-Temporarily.  Plans to be attorney general.

53:44.570 --> 53:46.570
So how come you didn't say anything?

53:48.570 --> 53:52.570
You're supposed to be taking your medication. Your father says, 'Please give him his pills.'

53:54.570 --> 53:56.570
I haven't had a pill since I left the house.

53:56.570 --> 53:58.570
Haven't wheezed once.

53:59.570 --> 54:02.570
'No negotiations.' What a hard ass.

54:03.570 --> 54:06.570
-He never negotiates.
-He's worried about you.

54:10.570 --> 54:14.570
Not him.  Hey!  You getting too famous.

54:16.570 --> 54:17.570
I'll buy you a wig.

54:34.570 --> 54:36.570
Ease it down, ease it down.

54:37.570 --> 54:38.570
Here pull it.  Pull it.

54:40.570 --> 54:44.570
Don't get me wrong -- I'm real sorry about your son.

54:44.570 --> 54:47.570
But the minute I heard about it I knew the people
would sit up there and listen.

54:47.570 --> 54:48.570
You mean come in and buy.

54:48.570 --> 54:51.570
You think it's just the money -- you're wrong.

54:51.570 --> 54:54.570
The average citizen is sick and tired of
seeing kids running wild.

54:54.570 --> 54:58.570
Look at this, looks what's been coming in.

54:58.570 --> 55:01.570
See that!  Look at that.

55:01.570 --> 55:03.570
That's from all over the country.

55:03.570 --> 55:10.570
Parents, educators, businessmen -- it's John Q
public.

55:10.570 --> 55:12.570
And all them voting age.

55:12.570 --> 55:14.570
What's that suppose to mean?

55:14.570 --> 55:19.570
Means if you running for office you better damn well
pay attention, because people want the filth cleaned
away.

55:20.570 --> 55:23.570
Hell you in law enforcement?  Well Do something!

55:23.570 --> 55:26.570
-Why don't you crawl back into the woodwork?
-Why don't you do your job?

55:26.570 --> 55:28.570
Can't do it maybe somebody else can.

55:28.570 --> 55:30.570
Simmer down, Lieutenant.

55:30.570 --> 55:31.570
Mr. Pyatt?

55:31.570 --> 55:34.570
-Yes sir.
-I appreciate your concern.

55:34.570 --> 55:37.570
Lieutenant -- I want road blocks,  helicopters, and
additional men assigned.

55:37.570 --> 55:39.570
Amen.

55:41.570 --> 55:44.570
-If it's not a real kidnapping --
-We don't know that, for sure.  Do we?

55:44.570 --> 55:46.570
-I do.
-For sure?

55:53.570 --> 55:58.570
We have to act on the bases on the worse possible
case.  Anything else I'd be advocating my
responsibilities.

55:59.570 --> 56:00.570
Yes sir.

56:03.570 --> 56:08.570
And it's the C-101 Billie Jean hotline.  Have you seen her?

56:08.570 --> 56:12.570
Call the Judge!  Day or night.
She's out there somewhere.

56:12.570 --> 56:14.570
This could be your lucky day.

56:15.570 --> 56:16.570
Line 4, You’re on the air!

56:21.570 --> 56:24.570
Billie Jean, I don't feel so good.

56:24.570 --> 56:26.570
I wonder why, you've only had 12 Kit-Kats.

56:31.570 --> 56:33.570
Are you Billie Jean?

56:34.570 --> 56:37.570
You got it bud.

56:37.570 --> 56:40.570
Someone's got to help, Kenny.
He's in a lot of trouble.

57:18.570 --> 57:20.570
Hey look it's Billie Jean!  Come on you guys.

57:20.570 --> 57:21.570
Let's go!  No, man, Billie Jean!

57:25.570 --> 57:28.570
I'll run with you anyday, Billie Jean.

57:28.570 --> 57:31.570
Billie Jean, show us your gun.

57:43.570 --> 57:46.570
-Get your hands off it!
-No.
-It's mine!

58:28.570 --> 58:30.570
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Billie Jean.

58:33.570 --> 58:37.570
-You're not her.  Get out of here.

58:40.570 --> 58:43.570
-Get your things.  We're leaving.

58:46.570 --> 58:48.570
YOU STAY PUT!

59:14.570 --> 59:24.570
Jesus Christ, you are her.
Is that your gang or what?  Don't bring them in
here.  I don't want any trouble.

59:31.570 --> 59:34.570
You thirsty?  I got some sodas out back.

59:38.570 --> 59:40.570
Kenny going to be spending some time at his
grandma's.

59:44.570 --> 59:49.570
-Did you guys rob that liquor store in Galveston?
-Yeah that was us.

59:49.570 --> 59:50.570
We did not.

59:50.570 --> 59:56.570
-What about that school in Laredo?
Did you burn it down?
-No way, guy.  We don't do schools.

59:56.570 --> 01:00:00.570
Here you go!  Souvenirs from the Billie Jean gang!

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:13.570
-Stop the car it's her!
-Who?
-Billie Jean!  Back there.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.570
You kidding me?

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:20.570
Goddamn!

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:22.570
What in the hell are you doing?

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:27.570
-Making us a down payment on a house.
$10000 dollars.
-You can't shoot them!

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.570
Let go of me!  I'm going for the tires.

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.570
Try it on.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.570
Holy shit!

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:46.570
-Son of a bitch!
-Have you lost you mind?

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:49.570
Get rid of that gun?  Just let them go!

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:54.570
Get down!  Those are real bullets!

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:26.570
I don't know what's gone on with you.

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:32.570
-I don't want it!
-Take the wheel!
-You are crazy!

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.570
He shot out the tire!

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:01.570
-Oh my god, Putter, your bleeding.

01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:07.570
-She's been shot.
-No I haven't.
-But there's blood.

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:14.570
-Oh my God, Putter, its happened.
-It's about time.

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:16.570
Gross.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.570
You keep quiet, Binx.
It's wonderful!

01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:38.570
Ok.  Let it down.

01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:59.570
I want you to take it easy.
You can stretch out in the back of the car.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.570
When can I get a diaphragm?

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.570
I don't know what'll done if you were hurt.

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:16.570
When they have a blizzard, everything is white.

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:22.570
The ground.  The sky.  Even the air.

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:27.570
And you can't hear anything but the wind.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.570
And the hiss of the snowflakes as they
land all around you.

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:40.570
-I was scared.
-So was I.
-Why were they shooting at us?

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:47.570
-Have you ever been to Vermont?
-Sure.  Skiing.

01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:51.570
Maybe we should go there tonight.
I mean all us -- hitchhike.

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:55.570
You can't.  Not now.  Everybody knows about you.

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.570
They want to see you get that money.

01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:59.570
They want to see us dead.

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:04.570
Remember Joan of Arc?  Why did this have to happen?

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.570
I'm glad it happened.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:23.570
This isn't working.

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.570
That's cause we're standing up.

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:32.570
Not us.  Putter and Ophelia,
I-I have to get them out of this.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.570
What?  You going to turn them in?

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:43.570
Whew.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.570
All right, girls, off you feet!  Wake up!

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:23.570
-Come on.
-Watch your hands!

01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:28.570
Surprised?  You know how I found you?
Billie Jean called me.

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.570
-Liar!  She wouldn't do that.
-She did it.

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:34.570
Now you tell me where she is?

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:35.570
WHERE IS SHE!

01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:38.570
Everywhere.

01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:09.570
No you getting this all mixed-up.  We start stealing cars -- who's going to care about a motor scooter?

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:10.570
We got to have wheels.

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:13.570
It's not stealing.  It's borrowing.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.570
What we do -- leave and I.O.U. for a car?

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:18.570
If that's what you want I'll pay for it!

01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:21.570
You think this is all a game.
Your money let's you get away with anything.

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:24.570
-I'm doing this for you.
-You running away from home.

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:28.570
-I can do that without you.
-Then do it.

01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:33.570
-You not mad at me, you mad at
yourself what you did to the girls.
-Oh don't tell me what I'm mad at!

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:31.570
Hurry up and get in!

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:36.570
If that's how you want it,
then I'm not your hostage any more.

01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:35.570
Come on!

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:37.570
Great!  I'll see you in jail.

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:39.570
There they are!

01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:39.570
RUN!

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:44.570
Oh shit!

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:58.570
Come on!

01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:25.570
Through the gates!

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:50.570
Get in!  Well get in.
What are you waiting for?

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:06.570
I want to tell you something -- Billie Jean called me cause you she was worry about you.

01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:09.570
She doesn't want you to get hurt.

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.570
Now you have to tell me something.

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:16.569
Is Binx using a real gun?

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:22.569
Lieutenant.  We got her.

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:26.569
Billie Jean.

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:49.569
-They all say they're Billie Jean.
- Call their parents.  Send them home.

01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:50.569
Putter Jacks!

01:08:50.569 --> 01:08:52.569
Mommy!

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:00.569
Putter, don't.  Putter!

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:06.569
Oh my god.

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:11.569
- Where are you Billie Jean?
- This is C-101, your station, waiting for your call.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:13.569
-Hello who's this?
-Tina.

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:15.569
-Where you calling from, Tina?
-Tyler.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:18.569
Tina from Tyler.  You're terrfic.  Talk to me Tina.

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:21.569
Billie Jean is the best!  Fair is fair!

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:23.569
Fair is fair at C-101.

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:27.569
-Hello who's this?
-This is Dave and I think she's hot!
Give her the money man!

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:33.569
Are you listening, Billie Jean?
There is 608 here.  Get over here girl
and pick it up.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:37.569
That's right.  It's been pouring in from
all over the state.

01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:44.569
The C-101's Billie Jean Scooter Fund.  You stay out
there long enough, you'll have enough to buy your
brother ten scooters.  HA!

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:50.569
-Line 4, you're on the air.
-Me and my girlfriend are cutting our hair off just
like you, Billie Jean.  Fair is fair.

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:50.570
-You want to go Mexico?
-No I can't.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:53.570
-But they can't touch you down there.
-I have to find my brother.

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.570
Billie Jean!  She's here.

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:01.570
-But it's pouring.
-I'll be fine.

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:34.570
Wake up, sleeping beauty.

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:42.570
-Billie Jean.
-I was so scared I wouldn't find you.

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:47.570
-Knew you come here.
Now you can take over.

01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:51.570
-Take over what?
-Guarding the hostage.

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:57.570
-Hi.
-Hi!

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:03.570
I thought I chased you away.

01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:37.570
-I'm sorry I got mad at you.
-Everyone gets mad at me.

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:40.570
Nothing makes sense.  Everything's crazy now.

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:44.570
Sure it is.
That's why you have to be crazier than they are.

01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:50.570
-I'm so glad to see you.
-That's not crazy.

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:58.570
I was beginning to think...
I don't even know who I am anymore.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.570
You're Billie Jean.

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:46.570
Hello?  Anybody here?

01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:59.570
I want to make a bargain with you, Billie Jean.

01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:02.570
You listening?

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:10.570
I want you to turn yourselves in.  To me.

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:17.570
I want Lloyd home and safe.  And you too.

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:20.570
Damnit.

01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:29.570
You listening, Binx?
I'll have that scooter fixed up better than new.

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:39.570
We got to end this kids, y'here.
We got to end this now.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:44.570
I want you to pick up the phone
and call me and say, 'yes'.  Y'here?

01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:49.570
Call me please.

01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:01.570
Sure like to see that scooter fixed.

01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:05.570
Better than new.

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:13.570
Billie Jean, we'll do it just the way you want.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.570
I'll give you my word.

01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:17.570
But I have to know if that boy is all right.

01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:24.570
-Hello this is Lloyd.
-How are you doing, son?

01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:26.570
I could use a steak.

01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:28.570
Hello?  Hello?

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:31.570
-It's me again.  Was that enough?
-That was perfect.

01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:34.570
Now Billie Jean, what I want you to do is --

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:35.570
That's all I wanted to say.

01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:37.570
Hello?

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:57.570
It's Billie Jean Day at Derby Beach.  You hear me people.  At C-101 makes you apart of it.

01:16:57.570 --> 01:17:01.570
Drop what you're doing!  Come on down!
I don't care what you're doing!

01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:04.570
If you can hear my voice you
are close enough to get here.

01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:10.570
She's live and in person.
Come on down and tell it to the Judge!

01:17:10.570 --> 01:17:14.570
If your within the sound of my face --
I want to talk to you!

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.570
The whole damn state of Texas and
she picks this place here.

01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:28.570
-There is a reason.  What is it?
-I don't know.

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:32.570
-Maybe she thought it was symbolic.
-Symbolic.  Oh shit.

01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:38.570
- The whole world is listening.
- And the whole world is waiting.

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:41.570
Come on in Billie Jean.  This is your day.

01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:53.570
I'm still hurt, damnit.  And a bullet is a bullet.

01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:55.570
Even if a kid did the shooting.

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:58.570
And I don't buy this toy gun crap!

01:17:59.570 --> 01:18:01.570
Those kids are dangerous.  You remember that.

01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:14.570
- What are you doing here? What your name, honey?
- Moranda.

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:15.570
Moranda - I love it!
 1:18:16,570 -->  1:18:19,570
Moranda, tell the Judge, what you think of this Billie Jean thing?

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.570
I believe she's the toughest thing that happened around here.

01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:33.570
-What are you doing here?
-Hey buddy this my beach!
And I want all these people out of here.

01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:39.570
Except Billie Jean.
She can stay and watch me surf.

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:42.570
Kind of a heavy attitude.  I think there.

01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:50.570
I don't have the slightes idea what she wants to say. She can recite the Gettysburg Address for all
I care.

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:54.570
Move back now!

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:54.570
Hey! Get your hands off me!

01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:26.570
-You should we try to clear them out?
-Nah this is what she wants.

01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:51.570
-You should had cordon off the beach.
-They would had came in on surf boards.

01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:59.570
-You think this is pretty funny.
-Mr. Muldaur ... you want to tell all these kids to
go home that's fine by me.

01:19:59.570 --> 01:20:02.570
When a riot starts I hope you can run pretty fast.

01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:32.570
-Thanks for the party.
-This wasn't my idea.  It was Billie Jean's.
Hope to God she shows up.

01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:35.570
-She gave her word.
-I bet she's already here.

01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:37.570
-Love it!
-So far out!

01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:40.570
Here it goes.

01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:46.570
-Where's the scooter?
-I don't know they were hunting a new mirror.

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:51.570
What are they doing here?

01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:03.570
-Who sent sharp-shooters?
-I did.

01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:06.570
What are you doing?  You're crazy!

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:10.570
Those kids are the ones that are crazy.  I need
insurance and your cooperation, Lieutenant.

01:21:10.570 --> 01:21:14.570
-I'm a cop, Mr. Muldaur.  You're a politician!
And you're not running for office here.

01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:38.570
Put down those weapons.
Open the bolts and give me the clips.

01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:40.570
I see her.

01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:01.570
You just sit and let her walk on in.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:31.570
Where's the scooter?

01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:39.570
I see the scooter.

01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:46.570
Far out.

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:58.570
It's not her!  It's not Billie Jean --
It's her brother!

01:22:58.570 --> 01:23:00.570
No, no.

01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:01.570
Shut up, Hubie.

01:23:01.570 --> 01:23:05.570
It's her brother!  It's her brother!
He's wearing a dress!

01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:07.570
It's a trick!  You little faggot!

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:09.570
Will you shut up, dork!

01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:56.570
Binx!  Stop!

01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:44.570
Got the camera on her.  Billie Jean...

01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:06.570
What do you want?
1:25:06,570 --> 1:25:09,570
You got no business with me.

01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:19.570
You're the one the blame.  You're the one going
around thinking you're so damn hot.

01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:27.570
-Who paid?
-What?

01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:34.570
Who paid, Mr. Pyatt?  Was it you?

01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:47.570
You still want the money?  That what you came here for?  Why didn't you say so?  Why didn't you say so?
1:25:49,570  --> 1:25:51,570
I got the money right over here.

01:25:54.570 --> 01:25:56.570
You giving me the money.  Now?

01:25:57.570 --> 01:26:02.570
-It's a real shame what happened.
Just got out of hand is all.
-Who paid for the scooter?

01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:04.570
What difference does it?
The whole thing was an accident.

01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:06.570
WHO PAID!

01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:11.570
I did.

01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:21.570
-For your boy.

01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:35.570
Look... no need to count this.
Little more, little less.

01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:41.570
Just take this... for your trouble.

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:48.570
You pig.  You don't even know what a pig you are.

01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:56.570
For troubles?  Or to keep my mouth shut?  Or maybe
for a few minutes in your room upstairs -- How much
is that worth to you, Mr. Pyatt?  Tell us!

01:26:57.570 --> 01:27:59.570
-Everyone is listening.
-Nobody forced you up there.

01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:02.570
You knew damn well what you were doing.

01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:05.570
What about our lessons?

01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:08.570
'Pay as you go.  Earn as you learn.'

01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:11.570
-What were you going to teach me, Mr. Pyatt?
-You lying piece of trash!

01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:14.570
You said, 'I was going to love it.

01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:17.570
Love being touched by a man like you.'

01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:21.570
I'm sick and tired of
your mouth you, little slut!  It's over!

01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:26.570
We're finished!

01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:29.570
IT'S OVER!

01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:40.570
You're right it's over with.

01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:46.570
I can learn to live with it.

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:57.570
But I can't take all this.

01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:05.570
Here's your change.

01:28:12.570 --> 01:28:16.570
You can keep your money. Go buy somebody else.

01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:35.570
Holy christ.

01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:46.570
Hubie?  Hubie!
Where are you, boy? I need your help.

01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:50.570
Get some water!

01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:55.570
Are you happy?  Are you satisfied now!

01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:01.570
Get some water here!

01:29:04.570 --> 01:29:06.570
What you all standing here for?

01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:10.570
Let's get some water before the whole place goes up!

01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:13.570
Someone get me some help.
Call the fire department..

01:29:13.570 --> 01:29:18.570
What you standing here for? What you looking at?
Get some help here!

01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:39.570
Listen you said it was cold.
But this is ridiculous!

01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:45.570
Far out.
