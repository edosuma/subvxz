Put the bag down
and your hands up, Shane.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.960
You sure you want to do this?

Huh! Oh!

01:32.640 --> 01:34.640
Run, Trig!

01:36.520 --> 01:38.160
You sure you're OK?
Yeah.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.440
I got 'em.
OK, I'll call for help.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.920
This is Sheriff Williams
over at Trig's shack.

Doesn't have to end like this, OK?

02:45.680 --> 02:48.079
You got him, Farmer?

02:48.120 --> 02:50.240
I got him, Sheriff.

Come on.
Can we do something here?

We'll see what we can do.

It doesn't have to be like this.

You're not in your right head.
Just tell me where the super lab is.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.200
If I tell you, will you let me go?

03:57.240 --> 03:59.680
You know I can't do that, Trig.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.360
You'll be helping a lot of people.

this is enough money

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
to keep the gator hunt quiet.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.840
Yes, sir.
We got him, Mayor Janssen.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.880
I don't care how you do it,

05:06.920 --> 05:09.600
but that gator's got to be gone
before the tourists get here.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.800
Yes, sir.
Aren't the police actually involved?

05:12.840 --> 05:14.960
We don't need to get into
all of that.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.800
It's just another nuisance
alligator as we've had before.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.240
It's just a little bit bigger.
No problem.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.880
Thank you again for your discretion.

Good to see you, son.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.000
Good to see you, Pops.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.240
That's Sheriff Williams to you,
Mr Tampa DEA man.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.960
I'm sorry to bring you here
under these circumstances.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.159
I was hoping the next time
that I see you,

06:33.200 --> 06:35.560
you'd kind of do a little
victory lap for all of us

06:35.600 --> 06:38.480
and tell us how you cleaned up
Tampa, the Keys,

06:38.520 --> 06:41.920
and Florida, of all the meth labs,
including us.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.680
Yeah, well, I'm working
on that, Pop.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.440
It just sucks that I got
to come back here for this.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.040
Well, I'm sorry I had to bring
you back to deal with a gator

06:50.080 --> 06:52.080
of all things, especially since...

06:52.120 --> 06:55.960
Pop, I'm fine, all right? I'm just
more sorry about Deputy Farmer.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.040
I know, it's tough,
but he was a good cop.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.080
Yeah, he was like family.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.880
If there's a meth lab on this
island, I got to find it.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.680
We have found bags of the stuff.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.320
I'm beginning to think
it's cartel related.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.760
I'll try to look into it.
It's not related to the cartel.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.200
If that was the case, I would have
bought the whole cavalry.

07:14.240 --> 07:17.000
Is that all you packed?
Where's all your DEA gear?

07:17.040 --> 07:19.720
Pops, we got the same gear
that you do, all right?

07:26.680 --> 07:29.960
Come on. We got to get to the
mayor's event at Grady's.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.200
That's why I wanted you
to get here early.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.280
To convince him to put the island on
the dangerous waters alert

07:35.320 --> 07:37.360
until we know what
we're dealing with.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.159
I've tried to talk to him.
He doesn't listen to me.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.200
Let's go.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.440
Bithlo, your buddy that
you used to work with

07:46.480 --> 07:48.480
at the Sweetwater Reptile Ranch?

07:48.520 --> 07:51.400
He's tracking the gator. He's out
there with a drone and everything.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.480
No luck yet, but it's
just a matter of time.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.360
Yeah, well, no-one knows gators
like Bithlo, that's for sure.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.880
You know, Pops, this place
never changes.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.760
I can still smell Grady's bar as
I was coming in over the water.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.800
I swear that deep fryer never stops.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.960
Yep.

(BIRDS CALL)

08:14.200 --> 08:16.680
Why don't you tell me
exactly what we're dealing with

08:16.720 --> 08:18.560
so I know how to handle the mayor?

08:18.600 --> 08:21.240
You think you got a killer gator
on meth?

08:21.280 --> 08:23.720
I don't think. I know.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.679
I saw it myself.
This thing is massive.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.640
It ate an entire duffel bag
full of meth.

08:29.679 --> 08:32.120
How much meth are we talking?

08:32.159 --> 08:34.280
A lot. A big bag.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.679
Swallowed it whole.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.080
By the time I figured out what
was going on, it was too late.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.600
There was nothing
I could do for Farmer.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.920
(GROWLING)

09:28.320 --> 09:31.440
People are beginning to already
arrive for the Memorial Day weekend.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.240
So the sooner we can catch
this gator, the better.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.480
The good thing is the last
ferry has already arrived,

09:36.520 --> 09:38.520
so you don't have
to worry about that.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.480
But if we can catch this gator
by tomorrow, we should be OK.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.240
Understood.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.800
So, how's Anna? I mean,
I know she used to love

09:46.840 --> 09:48.960
the Memorial Day festivities, so...

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
She didn't tell you?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.400
She quit the force
to go work for Grady.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.440
He was slowing down.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.720
She was insistent
that she helped him out.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.360
I'm surprised she didn't tell you.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.240
No, we really don't
talk much any more, so...

10:04.280 --> 10:08.400
Hm. Well, you know,
her biological father

10:08.440 --> 10:10.880
used to work for
a Cuban drug lord years ago,

10:10.920 --> 10:13.920
and it was the Tampa DEA office
that busted him.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.640
But that was like middle school.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.200
I don't think she should
hold that against you.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.440
I mean, I don't know, Pop.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.240
I'd be upset too if my best friend

10:23.280 --> 10:25.560
joined the same organisation
that got my father.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.400
Best friend? I think you're
a little more than that.

10:28.440 --> 10:31.160
No, Pop, what I'm saying
was that, you know,

10:31.200 --> 10:34.200
she would have wanted
this island clean, OK?

10:34.240 --> 10:37.240
And she wouldn't want anyone else
to go through that loss either.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.560
I'm glad she's helping Grady though.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.640
She probably still feels like
she owes him for adopting her.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.320
That's real sad about the force.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.680
She had a bright future.
She still does.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.960
Wait, Pop, did you say that the
gator ate a duffel bag full of meth?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.720
Are you sure it's not
underwater dead somewhere?

10:55.760 --> 10:58.400
It's probably bloated and rotten
off of Hallelujah Pass.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.960
You know, he seemed
to actually get stronger.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.920
We couldn't find any evidence of it
anywhere.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.800
We had some perps that may
have run off with it,

11:06.840 --> 11:09.400
but I'm convinced
that gator got its fill.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.280
I mean, sure. That first hit
of meth, you know, he felt no pain.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.720
Neurons firing at max,
his muscles rigid.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.960
I agree with you. It'll make him
real hard to stop.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.960
It's hard to take a human down on
meth if you hit them with a Taser.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.800
He would feel incredible euphoria,

11:22.840 --> 11:25.480
invincibility,
and then he'd be addicted.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.280
But any animal ingesting that
much meth would just OD and die.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.600
You didn't see it.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.640
This isn't just any animal.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.440
We got to round up all that meth on
the island before he gets to it.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.680
Or else it could be
way worse than that.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.400
I'm talking about induced psychosis.
It'll be way more violent, Pops.

11:42.440 --> 11:46.560
I know it's an island, but
there's a lot of places to hide.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.200
Finding a meth super lab,
taking down a meth-eating gator,

11:50.240 --> 11:52.560
that's a tall order.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.120
That's why you hired an expert.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.480
The mayor wants
to keep things quiet.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.160
Memorial Day weekend's a big deal.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.920
Yeah, Pops, you and I both know

12:00.960 --> 12:04.960
that anything dealing with gators
and humans never stays quiet.

That is why Sweetwater Point is the
best place to be on Memorial Day.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.320
We got food.
We got games for the kiddos.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.160
We got plenty of
Grady's Dockside Bar And Inn

13:06.200 --> 13:08.320
famous drinks for the grown-ups.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.280
We're going to have a big parade.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.840
The fireworks finale is
fired off by Grady himself,

13:12.880 --> 13:15.160
a vet of the US of A.

Hey, look who we have here.

back together again.

And, as always, first round's on me.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.640
(APPLAUSE)

13:38.160 --> 13:40.240
Mayor Jensen. I have
a couple of questions

13:40.280 --> 13:42.160
about what happened
on the island last night.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.480
I understand. I understand.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.760
I'm going to have to put that off
just for a little bit.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.040
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah!

13:49.080 --> 13:51.560
Uh... I'm looking forward to it.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.120
I'm going to call Bithlo
and check in,

13:54.160 --> 13:56.520
see if he's spotted anything
on that drone of his.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.360
Good idea. If he has seen something,
we can make a plan of attack.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.000
OK. Sounds good. Catch you later.
See you, Pops.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.440
Bithlo, are you there?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.040
(CRACKLING)
I'm here, Sheriff.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.520
What do you got for me? Any luck?

14:17.560 --> 14:19.920
I may have a visual
on the gator soon.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.960
Sheriff...
(WHIRRING)

14:26.600 --> 14:29.760
This gator is much, much larger
than I can handle.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.400
Bithlo, are you there?

15:16.440 --> 15:19.360
Bithlo, answer me.
Sheriff, this gator is no joke.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.080
If I had this gator on the ranch,

15:21.120 --> 15:22.840
I would have put him
down the same day.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.880
This one is just different, Sheriff.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.120
Just get back here in one piece.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.240
Hey.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.960
What can I get you...Dante?

15:45.360 --> 15:48.640
Hey, Anna.
Hey, yourself.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.240
Listen, I just wanted to say...

15:54.280 --> 15:57.080
You wanted to get in
on this open tab.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.480
First round goes quick.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.080
Um... Yeah.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.680
I'll take the usual.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.560
Sure. I got you.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.800
Thanks.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.520
There you go. On the mayor.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.720
After that, you have a tab.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.400
You don't want to pay it for me?

16:24.440 --> 16:27.200
OK, I'm sorry. OK.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.400
I thought Tampa
would have changed you.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.360
But... You look good.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.120
I'm still the same, I guess.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.680
You look good, too.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.200
I don't know about that.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.600
Well, I do.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.040
Dante?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.360
Boy, is that you?

16:55.400 --> 16:57.120
I am going to hug you right now.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.880
But I smell like bacon grease and
motor oil. Is that all right?

16:59.920 --> 17:03.200
It's worth the risk, Grady. Come on.
God, boy it's so good to see you!

17:03.240 --> 17:05.720
You look so good.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.760
Holy mackerel!
You staying here at the inn?

17:07.800 --> 17:10.119
No, actually I'm staying
with my pops.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.119
That's fair enough. I get that.
Makes sense, right?

17:14.160 --> 17:17.640
Hey, Sheriff.
We all heard about Farmer.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.839
We're sorry about him.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.839
Thank you.
We love him.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.880
He was a good man. Good cop.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.320
We're going to do something
special for him at the parade.

17:28.360 --> 17:30.360
We're going to do,
like, a big tribute.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.120
I'm going to take that gun there
and I'm going to do some bang-bang.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.320
Do you have anything bigger?

17:36.840 --> 17:39.000
I got just the thing.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.800
And for the rest of us, I'll make
some damn good barbecue.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.840
We're going to celebrate life.

17:43.880 --> 17:48.760
Sheriff, again, I want to offer my
sincere condolences about Farmer.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.240
He was a good cop. We want to give
him a memorial that he would want.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.360
He loved it here.
Yes, he did.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.240
Grady and I were just
talking about that.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.560
But, Mr Mayor, if you and
I could have a moment, please.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.560
Bithlo has spotted the
gator that got Farmer.

18:01.600 --> 18:05.080
It's massive. It's no ordinary
gator. We have to get it now.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.480
Yes, of course.
Of course we got to get it.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.240
We are going to get it.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.560
Now, listen here, the tourists
and the taxpayers

18:11.600 --> 18:13.920
that are coming here this weekend
pay good money.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.000
Money that pays
your salary, Sheriff.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.360
I understand, Mr Mayor.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.400
I got my people out there
getting the gator.

18:20.440 --> 18:24.240
What? Who? Who did you send out
in the swamp to get this gator?

18:24.280 --> 18:27.680
Relax, Sheriff. We're all here
trying to solve the same situation.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.320
We're on the same team.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.120
My people might not be
the expert your Bithlo is.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.360
But you know, they'll get the job
done. They're professionals.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.280
(GROWLS)

19:22.920 --> 19:25.120
Quiet!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.200
Let's get back to the boat.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.280
(GROWLING)

19:40.320 --> 19:42.720
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God!

19:42.760 --> 19:45.840
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Get to the damn boat!

19:45.880 --> 19:48.720
(GROWLING)

19:48.760 --> 19:51.080
Get going, get to the boat! Come on!

19:52.720 --> 19:54.920
(PANTING)

19:54.960 --> 19:57.040
Agh!

20:02.720 --> 20:04.280
(GROWLING)

20:04.320 --> 20:06.320
Agh!

20:09.160 --> 20:12.760
Get me outta here!
Pull!

20:12.800 --> 20:15.320
Skylar!
I'm stuck!

20:15.360 --> 20:17.360
Come on!
Come on, help me!

20:18.600 --> 20:20.960
Help me.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.360

(ROCK MUSIC)

21:20.080 --> 21:22.400
Dante Williams!

21:22.440 --> 21:24.320
Yo!

21:24.360 --> 21:26.360
Good to see you, man.
See you too, man.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.480
We'll be working together again,
huh?

21:28.520 --> 21:30.680
Just like old times at
the gator farm, huh?

21:30.720 --> 21:33.640
Yes, sir.Wow. I never thought
I'd see you here again, my friend.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.400
It took a whole gator to bring
your ass back to town.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.720
Good to see you, pal.
I'm happy to see you too, Bith.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.760
I'm just glad you're in one piece.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.800
Not as glad as I am.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.520
That gator is huge!
And he's mad too.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.640
He took down my drone.
Damn.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.800
I mean, we obviously ain't messing
with an ordinary gator, so...

21:50.840 --> 21:54.600
That animal is a...apex predator.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.400
And he's on meth.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.680
Be quiet. We don't want
to let the whole town know.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.600
We're gonna have to get him tonight.
We got to be smart about this.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.640
I'm gonna go now. I'm gonna kill it.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.840
OK?

22:07.480 --> 22:11.040
I'm coming too.
Whoa. No civilians.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.160
Yeah. We can't risk
you getting hurt, Anna.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.200
I have a reason to fight.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.280
I lost my dad to meth.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.320
I'm hardly a civilian,
and you know that.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.600
I was the best cop in my class.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.960
And it seems like you
need a lot of help.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.600
And as the mayor said,
Memorial Day weekend

22:28.640 --> 22:30.240
is what keeps Grady's bar open,

22:30.280 --> 22:32.280
and I have to make sure
that stays the same.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.440
This is our island,
and we're gonna fight for it.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.240
OK. We need the help.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.280
Just don't get eaten on my watch.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.120
Hey, Dad.
Hey, honey.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.720
I'm gonna help Sheriff
and Dante with something.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.600
You'll be fine while I'm gone.
Yeah. I'll be good.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.160
Where are you going?

22:57.040 --> 23:00.680
Um... Just some town logistics.

23:00.720 --> 23:04.240
Dad, make sure everything
goes off without a hitch,

23:04.280 --> 23:06.920
especially this weekend with
the parade and everything.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.640
Can you?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.760
OK.
OK.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.920
Love you.
I love you too.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.520
You be careful with them logistics.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.560
OK, I will.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
(ROCK MUSIC)

23:43.480 --> 23:45.480
Hurry up.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.040
I'm coming.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.280
Make room, ladies. I'm coming down.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.240
Cheers.
Cheers.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.080
Wow. Couldn't have asked for
a better day, huh?

24:01.120 --> 24:02.480
It's hot.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.760
It's perfect for
Memorial Day weekend.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.920
For the love of God, Daryl.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.000
Can you just keep packing the kayak?

24:14.040 --> 24:16.160
Or I'm putting you back to blender.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.480
Yeah, yeah.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.720
Oh!

24:24.800 --> 24:26.800
Geez!
Daryl!

24:28.200 --> 24:30.280
(GRUNTS)

24:32.120 --> 24:34.120
I got it!

24:50.800 --> 24:53.120
Hey, be careful, Craig.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.840
There's a gator they said has got
bags on the radar.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.800
They're always saying
stuff like that.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.960
Craig, behind you!
(SPLASH)

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Oh, shit!

25:33.840 --> 25:36.000
(GROWLING)

25:49.760 --> 25:52.160
(PANTING)

25:58.960 --> 26:01.600
Sheriff Williams, we need
back-up at the cell tower!

26:01.640 --> 26:04.600
OK, we're on our way.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.240
(SCREAMS)

26:12.280 --> 26:14.480
Did you see that?

26:17.120 --> 26:19.200
(SCREAMING)

26:21.280 --> 26:23.600
We need to get back to Grady's.
Hurry!

26:33.240 --> 26:35.240
What are we going to do?

26:35.280 --> 26:37.920
I don't know. I gotta think.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.160
Hey, Dante, you want to see
what I found?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.760
Yeah.
Look at this.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.240
Is that the gator's tooth?

26:52.280 --> 26:54.280
It is. Isn't that odd?

26:54.320 --> 26:57.680
The whole thing came off
just like that.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.200
That never happens, you know?

27:00.240 --> 27:02.600
Even when they fight,
it never happens.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.760
It's already showing
addictive symptoms.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.520
And soon it's going to feel like
it's developing mites.

27:14.560 --> 27:17.280
You know, it's a tactile
hallucination called formication.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.240
You know, it starts scratching
itself and developing open sores.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.760
But, you know, I've only
seen that happen on humans.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.800
Eat a pound of meth...

27:25.880 --> 27:28.440
..speeds up the process.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.480
You know, soon it's going to
want more meth,

27:30.520 --> 27:32.600
it's not going to stop
until it gets it.

27:32.640 --> 27:36.080
Pops, are you sure those
comms towers are fried?

27:36.120 --> 27:38.760
Our radios only go to
the station right now.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.440
Without that tower,
we have no radio

27:41.480 --> 27:43.640
or cell service to the mainland.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.400
Well, you know, the island's depth,

27:46.440 --> 27:49.640
it makes it approachable
only by mid-size boats

27:49.680 --> 27:51.680
and small-size boats.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.360
And the gator recognises the
small-size boats right away.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.080
So we're cut off.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.240
There's no way to
warn people coming in.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.920
I mean, I want people
coming into Dad's bar,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.240
but not if they're
lining up to be eaten.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.960
We're going to get rid
of that gator.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.480
We need to. I can't get those
red eyes out of my mind.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.760
The eyeshine.
Tapetum lucidum.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.800
It's a reflective retina.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.360
You know, like cat eyes, but
alligators have orange eyes.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.120
They were glowing
bright during the day.

28:18.160 --> 28:21.920
That's indicating it's metabolising
the Schedule 1 drug.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.440
You know, the meth is reflecting
its behaviour. Nothing else.

28:25.480 --> 28:27.120
I know that it's high on meth,

28:27.160 --> 28:29.160
but the sheriff's raid
on the meth lab

28:29.200 --> 28:32.000
was in prime gator territory,
and we know that.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.320
I mean, I don't want our
business to lose money.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.800
But instead of sticking to the
swamp, it came all the way to shore.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.440
We can't have it here
killing more people.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.880
Anna's right. The gator travelled
all the way to the dock.

28:43.920 --> 28:47.360
Yeah, it's probably
looking for its next fix.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.960
Its dopamine levels
are way out the roof.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
That means whatever
it's been craving,

28:52.040 --> 28:53.880
it's gonna be replaced by the meth.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.240
So now it's hunting meth
like hunting big game?

28:57.280 --> 29:01.240
Exactly. It's going to kill
whatever's in its way to get it.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.280
We can't let it have
that second chance.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.320
All right, no-one,
and I mean no-one,

29:06.360 --> 29:08.360
can be on the water tonight, OK?

29:08.400 --> 29:11.600
Tell the mayor we're sending out a
patrol car for a water curfew.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.760
All right, huge fines.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.000
You know, I couldn't help
but overhear.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.840
Dad...

29:20.760 --> 29:23.720
You boys say the word, and I'll
go downstairs and I'll get

29:23.760 --> 29:26.400
some of that decommissioned stuff
from the basement.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.600
Now listen, this weekend
is important to me,

29:28.640 --> 29:30.760
but nobody else has to die,
you know what I mean?

29:30.800 --> 29:33.280
Dad, how did you figure it out?
I didn't want you worrying.

29:33.320 --> 29:36.400
I'm not worried. I mean, you know,
I'm a little woohoo, but listen.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.560
No, no, no. That gator's no secret.
And I know you love this town.

29:39.600 --> 29:43.640
I couldn't stop you, and she's not
going to listen to me anyway, right?

29:43.680 --> 29:45.440
True.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.560
Sheriff, the way I look at it,
you're going to need deputies.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.880
The ones you got
really ain't no good.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.840
She, right there, deputise her.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.720
Dad...

29:56.760 --> 29:58.760
She should have never
left the force.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.160
Not for me, anyway.
I can't.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.840
Yes, you can, and you will.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.480
This town needs you more than I do.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.600
Besides, you can come back here
and work the bar

30:08.640 --> 30:10.760
after you're done
killing...meth gators.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.200
What do you say, Sheriff?

30:13.240 --> 30:16.640
Pops, deputise him too. If you're
going to treat him like an officer,

30:16.680 --> 30:18.120
might as well have
the right of one.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.360
OK. We need the help.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.840
Anna Wayna Fort, welcome
back to the Sweetwater PD.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.960
Thank you, Sheriff Williams.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.160
And Bithlo, that applies to you too.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.560
Hot damn! All right, you guys
raise your right hands.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.760
Dad...
Oh.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.080
Sorry, I'll make barbecue.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.520
So sorry, Sheriff. Thank you.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.480
All right, that's settled.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.720
We have a date with the mayor.
Let's go.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.400
Very nice, kids.

31:25.120 --> 31:27.760
Mayor Jensen!
Excuse me.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.240
Sheriff, what is going on out there?

31:33.280 --> 31:35.760
I need those comm towers
so when the mainlanders show up,

31:35.800 --> 31:38.840
they know exactly what's happening
and where during our activities.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.040
And I will never hear the end of it

31:41.080 --> 31:43.120
if I do not have wifi
or cell service.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.680
Mayor Jensen, if we don't
get those people off the boats

31:45.720 --> 31:47.920
and back on the shore, we're
going to have a bloodbath.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.520
I guess you forgot we have
a hungry gator on the loose.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.000
You have no
jurisdiction here, Dante.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.600
I don't have any jurisdiction.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.120
But I do right by our people
on this island.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.440
Well, the people on this
island elected me mayor,

31:59.480 --> 32:01.720
so what I say goes.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.880
Now, Sheriff, I saw what
happened on the dock

32:04.920 --> 32:07.280
and I know that
we've lost four souls.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.880
Four?

32:08.920 --> 32:13.320
I just towed Dwain and Skylar's
boat back to the dock,

32:13.360 --> 32:15.080
at least what's left of it.

32:15.120 --> 32:18.040
I was trying to call you for help,
but there's no cell service.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.800
I am sorry, I'm sorry
about those four people,

32:20.840 --> 32:22.680
but this ain't no ordinary gator.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.560
It ate 50 pounds of meth
and it's 30 feet long.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.920
It's extraordinarily unpredictable
and extremely dangerous.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.640
Dante, I'm aware it's dangerous.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.520
You are?
Because when I left this island,

32:34.560 --> 32:37.360
you just started your first term.
I know where you're going with this.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.400
There were problems
with the police department

32:39.440 --> 32:41.360
when I left and there's
even more problems now.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.160
People are dead! Dead!

32:43.200 --> 32:46.240
And you act like this
is only a minor inconvenience.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.600
Something's not adding up.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.760
You tell me.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.440
What's not adding up?

32:53.480 --> 32:55.800
Meth?

32:55.840 --> 33:00.400
You want me to call the DEA every
time some kid starts tweaking?

33:00.440 --> 33:04.280
Yeah, what about all
the tourists that hear

33:04.320 --> 33:06.680
that Sweetwater Point is a drug den?

33:06.720 --> 33:09.920
What about the people that live here
and try to make a living here?

33:09.960 --> 33:15.240
Now, I'm as upset about this as you
are, but it's just not that simple.

33:15.280 --> 33:19.600
Mr Mayor, that gator killed my
deputy and it's going to kill again.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.320
(EXPLOSION)
Whoa!

33:24.800 --> 33:27.760
We better check that out. The gator
could have found the meth lab.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.640
Why are you guys wasting your time?
You got miles of coastline to cover

33:30.680 --> 33:32.680
and you gotta find that
gator by tomorrow.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.520
We're here to do our job.
I expect you to do yours.

33:35.560 --> 33:38.360
Look who is here now,
aren't you, Dante?

33:38.400 --> 33:40.160
I'm gonna get rid
of your meth problem.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.040
After that, I'm gone.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.320
Dante, let's go.

33:44.360 --> 33:47.480
All right, so we gotta tell
everyone to be alert, all right?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.640
We gotta find out
what that explosion was.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.680
You take care of it, Dante.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.400
I got boats coming
tomorrow afternoon.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.360
When those people get
here tomorrow afternoon,

33:55.400 --> 33:57.200
I'll make sure
they're on the streets.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.080
Now Sheriff, you set up your curfew.
We can do without fishing for a day.

34:00.120 --> 34:03.199
At least that's good for my dad.
More people are staying at the bar.

34:03.239 --> 34:05.800
Anna, go spread
the word through town.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.960
Keep people away from the dock.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Keep them in the bar.
Copy that, sir.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.040
Anna, check the inn too, OK?

34:12.080 --> 34:14.239
You did say someone got away
from the drug bust?

34:14.280 --> 34:16.480
Trig.
Trig. Go see if Trig's at the inn.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.600
If that gator was coming to
make a beeline to shore,

34:18.639 --> 34:20.760
there must be some meth
on this island.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.719
Gators have like an extremely
intense sense of smell, OK?

34:23.760 --> 34:26.719
If they smell the meth,
they'll be after it.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.080
They'll find it.
You gotta do what he said.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.400
Stay safe, all right?
You too.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.040

Like, someone from the town,
not a tourist.

35:08.320 --> 35:10.320
Uh, yeah.

Some fellow barged in, demanded
a room, and then he cussed me out.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.160
That's not very unusual, right?

35:16.200 --> 35:19.080
That's true too. It is Florida.
But no, this guy is different.

the rudest I ever saw.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.680

he was here for my barbecue.

35:30.640 --> 35:34.160
Oh. Oh, yeah. He checked in. Why?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.920
OK. I think he has some
business with Sheriff.

were going to get complicated.

to kill there.

Pops, did that meth lab
bust on Trig and Shane

40:25.920 --> 40:27.760
give you any leads
to the super lab?

40:27.800 --> 40:31.040
That shack was just used by
low-level meth distributors.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.240
I've been trying
to pinpoint the location

40:33.280 --> 40:35.560
of the super lab for years.
No luck.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.000
I had a few leads,
but the gator ate them.

40:40.680 --> 40:45.520
I'm telling you, buddy,
this gator is not going to OD.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.960
He's going to get stronger,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.040
and if he gets a hold of the stash,

40:50.080 --> 40:52.840
bigger armour, bigger teeth,
invincible.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.400
So, if we don't kill it...

40:55.440 --> 40:57.480
If we don't kill it before it
gets to the super lab,

40:57.520 --> 40:59.320
then it's going to become
unkillable.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.800
We've got to stop it before
it gets its next fix.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.480
Hey, Bucky boy.

46:08.520 --> 46:11.960
How does it feel to know you're
about to lose to the new guy?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.040
Bucky boy?

46:26.040 --> 46:28.040

46:42.680 --> 46:44.960

We have a new winner!

46:47.240 --> 46:49.960
(BOOING)

46:50.000 --> 46:51.760
How do you do it, bro?

46:51.800 --> 46:54.240
It's because of my metal jaw
from the gator attack.

46:54.280 --> 46:57.600
You got quite an arm on you, boy.
Full of surprises.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.880
Sorry to take all
your money from you.

46:59.920 --> 47:03.520
Shoot, I'd pay twice as much
to see that big fella go down.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.880
He's getting a little
cocky anyway.

47:05.920 --> 47:09.320
Listen, you seem like
you can help me out

47:09.360 --> 47:11.400
with something that I need.

47:11.440 --> 47:14.160
Round these parts, help don't
come cheap, my friend.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.760
You take half,
I'll take the other half

47:18.800 --> 47:20.800
if you give me what I want.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.160
Well, you have my attention.

47:23.200 --> 47:27.400
I want the meth lab,
not the small one or a shed.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.800
Talking about the big one.

47:34.440 --> 47:36.440
It's a good investment.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.160
Tell you what,
I'll take you personally

47:39.200 --> 47:41.280
and bright and early
tomorrow morning.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.360
Meet you back here at 11.30am.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.560
Think you're up for it?

47:47.040 --> 47:49.120
Enough time to -
No.

47:49.160 --> 47:51.520
That's too late.

47:51.560 --> 47:54.240
We go now or this money walks.

47:58.160 --> 48:00.840
All right, look, you can take
all of it. The whole thing.

48:00.880 --> 48:04.280
Now you're talking my language.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.720
Let's roll, boys!

48:09.840 --> 48:11.840
(VIOLIN INTRO TO ROCK MUSIC)

48:19.600 --> 48:22.040
I'll take you to the lab.

48:22.080 --> 48:24.680
It's down yonder through
the swamp on a little island.

48:24.720 --> 48:28.080
We built a tricky way
to get there.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.480
Come on, guys!

48:39.160 --> 48:41.360
You sure we can trust this guy?

48:41.400 --> 48:44.360
Nope. What choice have we got?

48:47.120 --> 48:49.840
What are y'all talking
about down there?

48:49.880 --> 48:51.760
Nothing.

48:51.800 --> 48:55.320
Just thought this line was
tore down a while ago.

48:55.360 --> 48:57.400
It's very swampy back there.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.280
Yeah, tourists don't use it,
but we fixed it up.

49:02.320 --> 49:05.280
Ready?

49:05.320 --> 49:07.880

Come on, buckle in, let's go!

49:18.240 --> 49:20.480
(CHUCKLES)

49:20.520 --> 49:22.560
You in?
Yeah!

49:36.800 --> 49:39.640
Wait, what's happening? The line
stopped. What's going on?

49:41.680 --> 49:44.720
You honestly think I'm going to
take you on a tour of a meth lab?

49:44.760 --> 49:49.920
Dante Williams, son of Sheriff
Williams, and a DEA agent?

49:49.960 --> 49:52.160
You must think I'm stupid.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.560
You know who I am?

49:55.640 --> 49:59.080
Your pops has been keeping an eye
on this operation for months.

49:59.120 --> 50:02.040
We've had eyes on you
longer than you know.

50:02.080 --> 50:05.080
OK, you know I got to stop you and
I have to protect this island.

50:05.120 --> 50:07.360
All I know is, there ain't no way

50:07.400 --> 50:09.760
I'm letting you anywhere
near that lab, man.

50:09.800 --> 50:11.840
Not one chance in hell.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.280
(LAUGHS) If you think five grand

50:15.320 --> 50:18.040
is going to move the needle on me,
you're dead wrong.

50:18.080 --> 50:22.320
This lab made me more money
in one day than years of work.

50:22.360 --> 50:24.360
Nah.

50:25.680 --> 50:27.920
You're going to die right here.
Hey!

50:27.960 --> 50:30.040
No-one can hear the gunshots.

quicksand in Moccasin Wallow,

51:27.480 --> 51:29.640
I've been better, Grady.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.640
Well, we've all been better.

51:34.680 --> 51:37.120
The trick is just
keeping a level head.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.480
(SCOFFS) A level head.

51:41.160 --> 51:44.080
Huh.

51:44.120 --> 51:46.160
Make it a double.

51:56.520 --> 52:00.920
Mr Mayor, I know we're under
lockdown and all that,

52:00.960 --> 52:04.480
but you've had a whole
lot to drink. Maybe...

52:04.520 --> 52:07.080
Maybe you ought to
take it easy a little bit?

52:07.120 --> 52:09.200
I know what I can
and can't do, Grady.

52:09.240 --> 52:11.760
Mr Mayor, I'm not saying -
Look, I...

52:12.800 --> 52:15.640
I just sent two people
into the swamp.

52:15.680 --> 52:18.400
They got killed.
Why did I do that?

52:18.440 --> 52:22.480
I'm doing it because I'm trying to
keep this town alive and afloat.

52:22.520 --> 52:25.400
Why can't anyone see that?

52:25.440 --> 52:28.120
Mayor, we see it.

52:28.160 --> 52:30.760
Bill...

52:30.800 --> 52:33.240
We appreciate you, we do.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.840
It just got...complicated.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.240
Yeah.

52:43.280 --> 52:46.480
I'm gonna make things
a lot less complicated.

Come and get your meth!

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
You think it's gone?

54:33.040 --> 54:36.520
I don't know. Ain't heard
or seen anything in a while.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.840
Maybe he's not hungry any more.

54:38.880 --> 54:41.960
Bithlo, we both
worked that gator ranch.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.760
When was the last time you
haven't seen a hungry alligator?

54:45.800 --> 54:47.880
Fair point.
Exactly.

54:47.920 --> 54:51.120
Come on, better get
back to the mainland.

54:51.160 --> 54:53.600
Thought we were going to the lab.

54:53.640 --> 54:56.760
Look at this little island,
all right? There's nothing on here.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.200
It's probably back at
the mainland or something.

55:00.680 --> 55:03.280
I have to agree
with you on that one.

55:03.320 --> 55:05.880
I'm not swimming in that water.

55:05.920 --> 55:08.920
To get to the mainland,
you understand?

55:08.960 --> 55:11.760
There's no way.
Yeah.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.520
All right. Well, listen,
boats usually wash up here

55:14.560 --> 55:16.760
after hurricanes,
so maybe we can find one.

55:16.800 --> 55:19.680
Well, let's look for something
to call for someone, all right?

55:19.720 --> 55:22.840
There's got to be a radio somewhere.

55:30.640 --> 55:32.440
Dante!

55:32.480 --> 55:35.200
Come here, I found something!

55:39.560 --> 55:42.280
Liam, copy, this is Bithlo.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.120
Liam, do you copy?

55:47.160 --> 55:48.960
Yes, I copy.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.400
Hey, come and pick us up in the west
side of the island, all right?

55:52.440 --> 55:54.840
We are the west side of
the island in the shallow bay.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.520
Come and pick us up.
Already on my way.

55:57.560 --> 56:00.120
All right, copy.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.320
Come on, you freak!

56:22.440 --> 56:25.640
We're here! We're over here!

56:34.320 --> 56:36.400
Too afraid to show yourself?

Come here, you son of a bitch!

in front seat.

You hurt him and made him mad.

Sheriff!

57:55.320 --> 57:57.720
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.760
I think you shot him.

57:59.800 --> 58:02.800
You scared him for sure.
Come on, let's go!

58:02.840 --> 58:04.840
We have to go after him
while he's weak.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.040
No, no. No, I hurt my leg
dodging that damn car.

58:08.080 --> 58:10.280
I don't want you going alone.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.000

Yeah.

58:27.960 --> 58:29.920

to something else.

I hope for everybody's sake,
it's not the meth lab or...

58:33.160 --> 58:35.160
Or Dante and Bithlo.

58:36.480 --> 58:38.520
Should we warn them?

58:38.560 --> 58:43.040
The best thing we can do is
go back, regroup, and arm up.

OK.

I can't believe -

59:12.040 --> 59:13.640
Shh!

59:13.680 --> 59:15.720
What is it? What is it?

59:24.920 --> 59:27.760
We got to go.
Let's get back to Grady's.

59:43.680 --> 59:46.520
We can't stop those people from
coming to the shore on those boats.

59:46.560 --> 59:50.160
What we need to do is we can
fight to get off this island,

59:50.200 --> 59:52.200
or we can fight
to stay on this island.

59:53.440 --> 59:56.120
Look, I was thinking,
maybe we try to lure it

59:56.160 --> 59:58.800
to the quicksand in Moccasin Wallow
that Tucker was taking us to.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.720
Because we'd be dead.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.800
Quicksand didn't trap
the gator last time.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.040
Yeah, no, but Tucker
had to be going out there

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.360
for a reason, right?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.800
You said there was
nothing suspicious

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.080

Bithlo, the last 24 hours
we've seen nothing on this island.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.920
The only place we haven't checked
thoroughly is Moccasin Wallow.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.920
Didn't you say there was
waterways to get to there?

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.640
Yeah, that's right.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.280
We've had a couple of bad storms.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.240
That makes those areas passable.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.200
Perfect. That's where
we'll lure the gator.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.360
OK, OK.

and I'll ring it like hell.

And I've got some bags of meth
that we've captured

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.560

We'll use it as bait.

go will get the bait.

to see if the boat's good.

bigger that we can use?

wasn't real when we were younger.

can build a meth lab out here.

Even if it was camouflaged,

a large structure by now.

and lead the gator up in here. OK?

we're gonna trap him and flank him.
