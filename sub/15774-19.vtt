Oh!

00:32.850 --> 00:36.259
I thought I saw
a peeping Tom cat.

00:36.293 --> 00:37.096
Ha!

00:37.131 --> 00:40.435
Violation of my personal space.

00:43.074 --> 00:43.942
Help!

00:43.976 --> 00:47.715
Come back here,
you little squab.

00:48.450 --> 00:52.221
Here you go, Poochie.

00:55.095 --> 00:57.130
Help!

01:00.736 --> 01:04.541
I do enjoy a boxed lunch.

01:07.112 --> 01:09.414
Yum yum yum!

01:24.065 --> 01:25.900
Hey, watch it, Buster.

01:28.371 --> 01:30.238
You're mine, morsel.

01:30.273 --> 01:32.809
I don't think so.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.478
Upside down.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.347
Stop it, you can't eat me.

01:36.415 --> 01:39.484
You're a big ol' putty tat.

01:39.518 --> 01:41.019
Bad kitty. Bad kitty.

01:41.053 --> 01:45.390
All right, just a second here!

01:52.834 --> 01:54.869
Uh-oh.

Suffering succotash.
Where are we?

02:19.059 --> 02:22.862
Ohh. Cold.
Taz hate cold.

02:22.897 --> 02:25.265
Oh, what a desolate
place this is.

02:25.300 --> 02:29.704
I'm already freezing
my tail feathers off.

02:29.739 --> 02:31.306
Don't panic.

02:31.340 --> 02:35.077
Maybe I can see home
from the top of that mountain.

02:35.112 --> 02:36.278
Mountain?

02:36.313 --> 02:39.549
Why, you'll be a frozen catsicle
before you ever get there.

02:39.584 --> 02:41.752
Look, bird, it's your fault

02:41.787 --> 02:44.922
we're in this resulting
predicament.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.726
My fault?
I didn't do nothing.

02:47.760 --> 02:48.860
You tempted me.

02:48.895 --> 02:50.462
By taking a bath?

02:50.496 --> 02:51.630
You got problems, man.

02:51.698 --> 02:54.766
I'm going to find
a nice warm town.

02:54.801 --> 02:57.769
You, beast, coming with me?

02:57.804 --> 02:59.037
Taz.

02:59.071 --> 03:01.740
- What?
- Name Taz.

03:01.774 --> 03:04.009
Let's go, Taz.

03:04.076 --> 03:10.582
I hope I never see you again,
bane of my existence.

03:16.756 --> 03:18.523
Hey, wait up.

03:18.558 --> 03:21.427
I'm coming with you.

03:29.537 --> 03:32.406
Hmph. Who would have thought
that this thing

03:32.440 --> 03:33.840
would be wimpier than you?

03:33.875 --> 03:36.777
I'll have you know,
it's not exactly easy

03:36.811 --> 03:39.112
to fight off someone
10 times your own size.

03:39.147 --> 03:43.683
I've got strength in me
you can't even imagine.

03:43.718 --> 03:47.387
Yeah, well, I let you
get away most of the time.

03:47.455 --> 03:52.292
Gotta have something to do
around the old lady's house.

03:56.030 --> 03:58.232
Yah!

04:01.536 --> 04:03.671
Nice work, Mr. Useless.

04:05.975 --> 04:07.809
All right, easy there,
Fuzzball.

04:07.877 --> 04:10.712
I'm sure home is over
the next ridge.

04:10.780 --> 04:13.249
Follow me.

04:27.565 --> 04:32.368
Aw. The poor little devil
is all frozen.

04:32.403 --> 04:35.738
You can think Magellan
over here for the hypothermia.

04:35.773 --> 04:40.576
That is so like you
to try to turn this around.

04:40.611 --> 04:42.011
Can't you just ignore me?

04:42.046 --> 04:46.082
Can't you stop looking
so delicious?

04:49.921 --> 04:52.756
We just came from
that direction.

04:55.927 --> 04:58.528
Aah!

05:07.138 --> 05:08.872
Whoa!

05:08.940 --> 05:11.508
Aah!

05:14.971 --> 05:17.039
Where'd those other guys go?

05:17.073 --> 05:21.677
I'm kind of embedded
in your back at the moment.

05:21.711 --> 05:22.711
Oopsy.

05:22.745 --> 05:24.345
Don't worry, fellas,

05:24.380 --> 05:26.581
I think we lost him.

05:26.615 --> 05:28.282
Lost who?

05:29.685 --> 05:32.052
Lost him!

05:32.454 --> 05:36.056
Ha ha ha!
Blacque Jacque Shellacque,

05:36.090 --> 05:39.726
the most formidable
tracker in all the Klondike,

05:39.761 --> 05:40.928
has found you.

05:40.962 --> 05:43.530
Just head south
on the train tracks.

05:43.565 --> 05:46.967
I'll distract him
and head north.

05:47.001 --> 05:48.202
Good luck.

05:48.236 --> 05:54.841
Surrender yourself,
Monsieur Abominable Snow Person.

05:56.712 --> 05:58.613
But what is this?

05:58.647 --> 06:00.415
Hmm.

06:01.917 --> 06:03.385
A-ha!

06:03.419 --> 06:06.521
Adieu, my great white quarry.

06:06.556 --> 06:07.856
It pain me to see you go,

06:07.891 --> 06:14.697
but I suddenly find myself in pursuit
of more interesting targete.

06:23.641 --> 06:25.074
Ooh.

06:33.784 --> 06:36.519
See, it's getting
warmer already.

06:36.553 --> 06:38.720
I knew this was
the right way to go.

06:38.755 --> 06:40.755
I don't remember
you saying anything

06:40.790 --> 06:43.091
about walking
the train tracks south.

06:43.125 --> 06:47.695
It was implied,
you little yellow nimrod.

07:03.053 --> 07:04.587
Aah!

07:07.124 --> 07:07.958
Ohh!

07:08.025 --> 07:10.894
He's stuck!
I can't lift him.

07:10.962 --> 07:11.996
Aah!

07:13.165 --> 07:14.832
Ohh!

07:21.069 --> 07:22.049
Wow.

07:22.169 --> 07:24.509
You saved my life.

07:24.543 --> 07:27.378
Hey, why should we
walk the tracks

07:27.412 --> 07:29.619
if we could ride the rails?

07:52.071 --> 07:55.740
We make a pretty good team.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.377
Team.

08:01.448 --> 08:05.484
Enjoy your freedom,
you fury little fugitives.

08:05.518 --> 08:09.521
For freedom is measured
only by the distance

08:09.556 --> 08:12.557
between the hunter
and his prey.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.859
Uhh!

08:49.998 --> 08:53.200
Ah-choo!

08:53.769 --> 08:55.469
I thought we were a team.

08:55.537 --> 08:59.607
Yeah. And you don't eat
your teammates.

08:59.642 --> 09:01.610
Oh!

09:01.644 --> 09:03.811
My bad.

09:07.483 --> 09:11.453
You walking on hind legs,
pretty pet creatures.

09:11.488 --> 09:17.059
Now is the time for you to come
along peacefully, huh?

09:26.337 --> 09:27.804
Yah!

09:42.653 --> 09:43.520
Heh heh!

09:43.554 --> 09:46.622
It seems my tiny brain targets

09:46.657 --> 09:50.659
have run out of
choo-choo train.

10:14.116 --> 10:16.151
You're a genius, putty tat.

10:16.185 --> 10:18.920
Whoa. I can't believe
I just said that.

10:18.955 --> 10:20.956
All right, from here on in,

10:21.024 --> 10:24.026
there's no more
trying to eat each other.

10:24.060 --> 10:25.794
We're a team. Deal?

10:25.829 --> 10:27.095
- Deal.
- Deal.

10:27.130 --> 10:29.498
Now all we have to do

10:29.565 --> 10:32.500
is relax in our own private car

10:32.535 --> 10:34.569
as we roll down the tracks.

10:34.603 --> 10:38.506
Out of control in
the wrong direction!

10:38.540 --> 10:39.840
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

10:39.874 --> 10:42.043
Whoa!

10:47.182 --> 10:49.850
We're saved!

10:57.123 --> 10:59.225
Give me the wrench.

11:01.294 --> 11:05.331
No, junior, the wrench.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.301
Forget it!

11:11.337 --> 11:15.007
Get off the Jack,
you pea brain.

11:15.041 --> 11:15.874
Aah!

11:15.909 --> 11:18.477
What else can I do, pa?

11:18.511 --> 11:23.048
Why don't you go get yourself
some souvenirs or something?

11:23.082 --> 11:24.917
Oh, goody, goody.

11:24.985 --> 11:28.921
I helped and I get souvenirs.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.656
Taz hate water.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.826
Oh, yeah, and cats
totally love it.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.196
Ooh, at least I finally
got my bath.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.265
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

11:39.299 --> 11:45.204
A little kitty,
a darling yellow birdie,

11:45.238 --> 11:49.107
and some kind of
dog-like creature.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.443
Would you stop squeezing us?

11:51.477 --> 11:54.179
That actually hurts
quite a bit.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.613
Ha ha ha!

11:55.647 --> 11:59.316
Oh, you sure are
a funny kitty cat.

11:59.351 --> 12:01.085
Yes, you are.

12:01.119 --> 12:03.921
Now, when I say,
"Start the car,"

12:03.988 --> 12:05.289
start the car.

12:05.323 --> 12:06.423
Yes, Henry.

12:07.692 --> 12:08.459
Aah!

12:08.493 --> 12:09.893
What are you doing
starting the car?

12:09.928 --> 12:11.729
I thought I said
not to start the car

12:11.763 --> 12:13.531
until I say,
"Start the car."

12:13.565 --> 12:16.135
Don't start the car till I say,

12:16.202 --> 12:17.369
"Start the car."

12:17.404 --> 12:18.404
Yes, Henry.

12:22.609 --> 12:27.012
Hey, pa, I got my souvenirs.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.082
Just get in the car.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.884
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

12:30.951 --> 12:32.485
Ok, pa.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.254
Go on a road trip, they said.

12:34.288 --> 12:39.425
Nothing's more relaxing
than the open road, they said.

12:39.994 --> 12:43.263
Now, we're all gonna
play a little game.

12:43.297 --> 12:46.166
We're gonna see
who can go the longest

12:46.200 --> 12:47.801
without making a sound.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.303
I don't want to hear
one word out of anyone

12:50.338 --> 12:52.773
till we get to
the grand canyon.

12:52.840 --> 12:58.011
- But--
- Not one word.

13:03.518 --> 13:04.752
I was just going to say

13:04.786 --> 13:07.622
that you forgot to take
the car off the Jack.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.223
Ha ha ha!

13:09.257 --> 13:12.226
You lose, ma.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.037
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

13:24.071 --> 13:26.038
Uh.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.173
I miss granny.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.309
Yeah, me, too.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.278
It is with sincere regret

13:32.312 --> 13:35.147
that the great Blacque
Jacque Shellacque

13:35.182 --> 13:39.151
inform you that he has
uncharacteristically lost sight

13:39.186 --> 13:42.822
of his most elusive bounty.

13:45.359 --> 13:48.462
Scratch that.
Call you later.

13:53.235 --> 13:54.870
Oh, now let me see.

13:54.904 --> 13:58.574
Where did I put that
pretty bow for your hair?

13:58.641 --> 14:03.980
Oh, where do you think
you're going, Mr. lumpy bottom?

14:04.014 --> 14:06.817
You can't go flying
out the window

14:06.851 --> 14:11.554
without first
asking for permission.

14:22.799 --> 14:26.702
Who would have thought
the desert would be so hot?

14:26.736 --> 14:30.539
Junior, what are those animals
doing in my car?

14:30.574 --> 14:33.009
But, pa, you said
I could have them.

14:33.076 --> 14:34.944
You know you're not
allowed to have pets.

14:34.978 --> 14:37.747
Well, actually, dear,
you said he could keep them.

14:37.814 --> 14:42.584
Fine, but I ain't gonna be
the one burying them this time.

14:42.619 --> 14:43.652
Burying them?

14:43.686 --> 14:47.723
It's all fun and games
until someone gets crushed.

14:47.757 --> 14:51.560
Oh, Henry. Junior's just
what I like to call

14:51.595 --> 14:54.297
lethally affectionate.

14:54.331 --> 14:55.264
Yipe.

14:55.299 --> 14:57.567
Uh, I think it might
be time to say good-bye

14:57.601 --> 15:00.070
to our bear family friends.

15:00.472 --> 15:04.008
Ooh, I got an idea.

15:08.146 --> 15:09.346
Uh, pa?

15:09.381 --> 15:12.516
I think I had an accident
in my pants.

15:12.550 --> 15:15.619
Didn't I ask if you
had to go to the bathroom

15:15.653 --> 15:16.920
before we left?

15:16.988 --> 15:22.125
But, pa, I did not
have to go when we left.

15:27.964 --> 15:31.067
Let's boogie.

15:38.442 --> 15:40.877
Ugh. Uhh.

15:40.911 --> 15:42.712
So thirsty.

15:44.048 --> 15:46.082
I need a drink.

15:49.254 --> 15:50.421
Ahh.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.061
- We're saved!
- We're saved!

16:03.937 --> 16:06.238
What?

16:39.171 --> 16:42.641
Oh, goody, you're awake.

16:42.675 --> 16:45.510
Let me take your vital signs.

16:45.545 --> 16:47.579
What are you talking about?

16:47.613 --> 16:49.047
Where are we?

16:49.082 --> 16:51.817
You're in my patrol balloon.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.387
I'm a rescue buzzard.

16:57.824 --> 16:59.124
You no eat us?

16:59.192 --> 17:02.528
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

17:02.562 --> 17:05.364
I'm not here to eat you.

17:05.397 --> 17:07.633
I'm here to help you.

17:07.666 --> 17:10.703
So, uh, how do you
sustain yourself?

17:10.737 --> 17:15.473
Uh, well, it's
a slow-moving balloon.

17:15.508 --> 17:20.711
I don't always get
there in time.

17:20.746 --> 17:22.579
Ugh.

17:38.996 --> 17:40.863
Huh?

17:41.999 --> 17:42.699
Ha ha!

17:42.733 --> 17:46.269
The game, she is on a new foot.

17:51.843 --> 17:53.911
You know, at times like this

17:53.945 --> 17:56.279
I wonder why we ever
fought at all.

17:56.314 --> 17:59.249
Well, it usually has
a lot to do

17:59.317 --> 18:00.717
with you trying to eat me

18:00.785 --> 18:02.886
and me trying not to be eaten.

18:02.920 --> 18:06.289
Yeah, I can't remember, either.

18:06.323 --> 18:09.458
Taz like friends.

18:11.628 --> 18:16.298
I'll have you home in no time.

18:17.033 --> 18:18.166
Ha ha ha!

18:18.201 --> 18:23.838
No one escape
Blacque Jacque Shellacque.

18:33.082 --> 18:35.316
Ha ha ha!

18:47.731 --> 18:51.168
Beeky Buzzard to the rescue.

18:51.202 --> 18:52.970
Ha ha.

18:57.276 --> 19:01.547
Maybe I should have
just eaten them.

19:01.581 --> 19:02.815
Ha ha ha!

19:12.826 --> 19:14.860
I wonder where he's taking us.

19:14.895 --> 19:17.230
It can't be anywhere good.

19:18.832 --> 19:19.932
I have the animals.

19:19.967 --> 19:24.170
I think you will agree this
more than satisfy our debt.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.872
Oh, on, we're done for.

19:26.907 --> 19:28.440
Taz scared.

19:28.475 --> 19:30.476
Whatever happens next,

19:30.511 --> 19:32.211
I just want you to know

19:32.279 --> 19:35.548
you're not the bane
of my existence.

19:35.583 --> 19:36.916
I love you, man.

19:36.951 --> 19:41.821
Stop. You're...
Going to make me cry.

19:41.856 --> 19:44.024
Taz love kitty.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.660
Taz love birdie.

19:53.168 --> 19:54.802
There you are, boy.

19:54.870 --> 19:59.274
Oh, you had me so worried.

20:01.978 --> 20:04.280
Ha ha ha!

20:04.347 --> 20:05.614
I told you he'd find them.

20:05.649 --> 20:11.087
There's no finer tracker than my
cousin Blacque Jacque Shellacque.

20:11.122 --> 20:15.392
It's a fair exchange for the
mechanical bull you sent.

20:15.427 --> 20:18.095
And your pets
are very slippery.

20:18.129 --> 20:23.801
They escaped every time
I fired my tranquilizer bullets.

20:24.636 --> 20:26.537
Tranquilizer bullets?

20:26.605 --> 20:29.640
There's no such thing
as tranquilizer bullets.

20:29.708 --> 20:32.777
Cut him some slack.
He's Canadian.

20:32.811 --> 20:34.179
Come.

20:34.246 --> 20:37.081
Let us retire to
your local gymnasium

20:37.116 --> 20:40.818
to work out our pies
and tris, huh?

20:40.853 --> 20:44.488
The house has been
so quiet without you.

20:44.522 --> 20:47.958
Hey, daffy, look,
Poochie's back.

20:47.992 --> 20:49.032
Oh, did he go somewhere?

20:49.060 --> 20:54.130
Was it the dump? He smells
like he went to the dump.

20:58.201 --> 20:59.335
What?

20:59.369 --> 21:01.436
You love me.

21:01.471 --> 21:02.938
I never said that.

21:02.972 --> 21:05.240
Oh, yes, you did.

21:05.274 --> 21:06.675
You love me!

21:06.709 --> 21:08.710
Look, I was under
a lot of pressure.

21:08.745 --> 21:12.181
People say all kinds of things
when they're stressed.

21:12.215 --> 21:13.849
That's ok, putty tat.

21:13.883 --> 21:16.152
You ain't half bad yourself.

21:16.186 --> 21:17.053
Look, bird,

21:17.087 --> 21:19.722
the minute the old lady
closes this door,

21:19.757 --> 21:22.141
it's business as usual.

21:22.377 --> 21:24.795
Bring it on.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.634
Old putty tat!

21:31.305 --> 21:37.516
