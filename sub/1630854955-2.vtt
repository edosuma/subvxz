of second chances.

used to a team,

10:52.752 --> 10:54.219
I was finished.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.887
- Ev, please, play.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.590
- You won't laugh
or criticize or...

10:59.660 --> 11:00.958
- No.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.760
No, I'll just listen.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.766
- OK.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.043
(Phone ringing)

11:19.046 --> 11:20.645
- Oh my God! Sorry!

11:20.647 --> 11:22.046
It's your brother.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.616
Hey, what's going on?
-<i> Are you available right now?</i>

11:24.751 --> 11:26.551
<i> I caught us a big finish.</i>
- What? Where?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.052
-<i> Just meet me at 132 McGuire.</i>

11:29.322 --> 11:30.722
- Ev, I'm so sorry.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.458
Um, can we do this
when I get back? OK.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.728
OK...

11:36.730 --> 11:37.729
(Keys clanging)

11:37.731 --> 11:38.729
...I'm on my way.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.331
(Door opening, closing)

11:41.535 --> 11:42.734
So, what are we doing here?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.470
- We need a top lawyer to seal
the deal with Keas, right?

11:45.539 --> 11:46.871
- Yes.
- Someone impressive.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.340
Someone everybody wants.
The biggest, baddest lawyer.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.075
- All yeses.
- Well, I found her.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.678
Now you need to win her over.
I hear she's a fan.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.480
- Wait, who is it?

11:55.482 --> 11:56.914
- Miranda Delano.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.884
Come on, man!

12:06.426 --> 12:08.093
(Footsteps approaching)

12:08.228 --> 12:10.829
- Apologies, my daughter
is going through a phase.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.164
She wants to stay up late.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.465
She's testing me.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.969
- Kids will do that.

12:15.969 --> 12:16.033
- Yeah. Do you have any?
- Kids will do that.

12:16.033 --> 12:18.202
- Yeah. Do you have any?

12:20.674 --> 12:21.839
- Uh, no.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.241
No, not yet.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.310
- Well, when I was
going through my divorce,

12:25.445 --> 12:26.978
I just felt so guilty
all the time

12:27.047 --> 12:28.379
that I kept
on giving into her.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.181
And... if I could do it
all over again,

12:30.217 --> 12:31.982
I would have done it
very differently.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.318
- Hmm. What we wouldn't do
for our kids, right?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.221
- Yeah.

12:36.223 --> 12:40.324
- I--I believe you two are,
um, already acquainted?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.661
- Yes, Mr. Grimmer gave me one
of my very rare court losses.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.695
(Pat chuckling)

12:44.731 --> 12:46.264
- Well, you can't win them all.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.199
- I do, usually.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.201
- Hmm.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.769
- Still...

12:51.772 --> 12:55.239
I wonder what I could have done
to bring you to your knees.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.343
- It was touch and go there
for a while.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.479
- Hmm, good to know
that I had a shot.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.648
- Well, the past is the past.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.552
No sense in revisiting it.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.886
(Glass thudding)

13:10.023 --> 13:12.223
- All right, uh,
I'll cut to the chase.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.558
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.627 --> 13:17.362
- You're exiting a firm, and,
uh, we want you on our team.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.297
- Oh, that's bold!

13:19.366 --> 13:20.431
You're a boutique.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.033
It's impressive you landed
the Keas contract.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.236
- Well, we know you're coming
from the largest,

13:25.371 --> 13:26.971
most prestigious firm
in the city,

13:27.106 --> 13:29.941
which I'm sure came with
an equal dose of bullshit.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.042
But with us,

13:31.111 --> 13:32.777
you could write
your own ticket,

13:32.779 --> 13:34.245
make your own rules.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.518
- If this offer is genuine...

13:42.355 --> 13:43.921
I'm available.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.389
(Chuckling)

13:49.529 --> 13:50.394
- Yep.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.530
It is.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.800
- You OK, man?
- Yep, I am.

13:55.935 --> 13:58.002
- 'Cause you felt
a little off in there.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.605
- It's all good.
- Yeah, I'd say it's all great.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.006
- Great.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.627
Pat, did you hire a new...

14:57.631 --> 15:00.531
- Mr. Landry just gave me
the good news.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.733
- That we're signing
Miranda Delano.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.736
- Well, there are
other attorneys

15:04.871 --> 15:06.203
that we're considering, so...

15:06.239 --> 15:08.406
- We're happy with Ms. Delano.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.741
- Only the best
for our favourite client.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.476
- That's what we love to hear.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.744
- Yes.

15:13.780 --> 15:14.945
Let's get the ball rolling.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.280
- Yeah, we have to act fast.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.549
There's two holdouts who refuse
to sell their property

15:18.618 --> 15:21.018
which is significantly
delaying our first phase.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.754
You can use your powers
of persuasion.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.358
- Great.
- We're on it.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.560
- Good.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.596
(Birds chirping)

15:33.733 --> 15:35.967
- Listen, about Delano,

15:36.102 --> 15:38.603
I think we need
to explore other options,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.071
you know, due diligence.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.238
- Why? We love her.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.840
They love her.
She loves us.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.108
Done deal.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.310
- It's just, she'll have
the upper hand negotiating.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.412
She'll be able to squeeze us.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.382
- What happened
between you and Delano?

15:51.418 --> 15:52.717
- Nothing.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.251
Seriously, we get along fine.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.186
It's--
- How fine?

15:56.222 --> 15:57.789
- I didn't sleep with her, Pat.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.390
- Oh, well, then case closed.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.257
Moving on.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.792
Lose the tie and jacket.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.197
(Knocking on door)

16:06.266 --> 16:09.133
-<i> Wouldn't this mine be bad</i>
<i> for the environment?</i>

16:09.268 --> 16:11.002
- Oh, the impact
would be minimal.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.937
And there will be
public hearings explaining

16:13.072 --> 16:15.672
everything and to answer
any and all concerns.

16:15.709 --> 16:16.674
- Hmm.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.011
- It's a nice place
you've got.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.347
But it's a big one
to maintain by yourself.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.549
(Sighing)

16:24.684 --> 16:27.518
- My Jerry would be livid

16:27.554 --> 16:29.687
if he saw
the condition of the lawn.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.688
I can't keep up!
- You could afford a condo.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.091
And the grounds would be
maintained by staff.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.893
I'm sure your Jerry
would be happier

16:35.895 --> 16:37.228
to know you're
being looked after.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.164
With this money,
you'd be set for life.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.599
- How much is it?

16:59.819 --> 17:01.085
- Beautiful.

17:01.087 --> 17:04.922
You're not in top shape
after so many years.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.924
- Maybe it's too late.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.260
- How badly do you want
this audition?

17:10.864 --> 17:12.396
- More than anything.

17:12.399 --> 17:15.533
- You'll have to commit
to a lot of extra practice time.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.202
And stop second-guessing
and doubting yourself.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.537
Can you do that?

17:19.539 --> 17:20.638
- Yes.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.110
(Phone vibrating)

17:26.179 --> 17:28.212
Oh, sorry.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.348
Yeah?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.483
- Ev, where have you been?

17:32.618 --> 17:34.151
I've tried you,
like, 50 times.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.286
-<i> I'm at my lesson.</i>

17:35.421 --> 17:36.821
<i> I told you, remember?</i>

17:36.890 --> 17:38.222
- Oh, right.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.623
Yeah, sorry.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.226
Uh, listen, we need you
to make some adjustments

17:42.361 --> 17:43.627
<i> to Mrs. Raymond's contract</i>

17:43.663 --> 17:45.496
<i> and get it emailed over</i>

- OK, I'll do it in an hour.
-<i> No, no.</i>

17:47.634 --> 17:48.633
No, I need...

17:50.303 --> 17:52.369
Uh, I mean, yeah, great.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.771
That's, uh, that's great.

- You can name your price.
- Fuck you,<i> esti</i> !

18:07.854 --> 18:10.855
- He'll change his mind.
They all eventually do.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.257
- Yeah, it kind of seems
to me like this deal is

18:13.392 --> 18:14.792
a long way from being inked.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.860
Negotiation 101, Philip,

18:15.929 --> 18:18.329
we just have to find
a way into this man's heart.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.798
- OK, OK. We do everything
above board, right?

18:20.800 --> 18:21.732
- Yeah, absolutely.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.400
If there is a board,
we're above it.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.536
Trust me.
- Sure.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.207
- I've been thinking
about a trip.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.343
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

18:32.478 --> 18:36.347
- Well, I'm--I'm pretty busy
with work right now, but, um...

18:36.416 --> 18:37.748
but you should go.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.184
Yeah, have fun.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.518
- Hmm.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.589
So, uh, how come no woman
has snapped you up?

18:48.194 --> 18:50.161
- It's, uh, it's a mystery.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.363
(Chuckling)

18:52.432 --> 18:55.833
- Well, I might just have
to fall in love with you.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.039
- Weren't you thinking
of leaving him?

19:02.108 --> 19:04.208
- Things have been
good lately.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.978
He's really trying. He is.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.113
- And what about you?

19:09.115 --> 19:10.514
Your music?

19:10.517 --> 19:13.217
I mean, Ev, you gave up
your life for this guy.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.852
- I didn't give up my life.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.053
I chose Phil.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.522
I chose love.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.261
I haven't made up my mind.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.665
Some days it's a yes,
some days it's a...

19:28.801 --> 19:29.933
I don't know.

19:29.969 --> 19:33.203
- OK, so how about I drink
enough for the two of us?

19:33.239 --> 19:34.871
- You would have anyway.

19:34.908 --> 19:38.809
- Still. To you taking
the music world by storm.

19:53.960 --> 19:54.892

19:56.996 --> 19:57.929

20:02.301 --> 20:04.234

20:06.272 --> 20:08.572
<i>One of the hottest dry seasons.</i>

20:08.608 --> 20:10.307
<i> October is the coolest</i>
<i> wet season...</i>

20:10.376 --> 20:12.376
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.045
- Late practice?
- I went out.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.748
- Could have called.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.717
- I was with Naomi.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.253
Is that OK?

20:22.388 --> 20:24.288
- Yeah, of course.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.189
How is she?

20:26.226 --> 20:28.558
- She's getting ready
for the tour.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.496
- You made any decision
about the baby?

20:33.499 --> 20:35.266
'Cause we're getting
to the point where

20:35.268 --> 20:37.201
we're gonna have to make
plans either way.

20:37.336 --> 20:38.969
- I don't want
to get into this now.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.103
I'm beat.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.339
- Sure.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.809
Yeah, of course.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.610
(Man on TV
talking indistinctly)

20:47.613 --> 20:49.613
(Footsteps retreating)

20:57.957 --> 20:58.823
- Huh?

21:22.915 --> 21:27.184
-<i> You do understand the urgency</i>
<i> of acquiring these properties?</i>

21:27.320 --> 21:28.719
- Well, we already
signed Raymond

21:28.755 --> 21:30.755
and we're confident
Gervais will sign this week.

21:30.890 --> 21:34.058
- Yeah, on, um,
Mrs. Raymond's contract,

21:34.060 --> 21:36.993
the purchaser is drafted as,
"Keas International,"

21:37.030 --> 21:38.729
it should be: "Keas Canada."

21:38.731 --> 21:40.598
- If our team
hadn't caught the error,

21:40.733 --> 21:43.667
it could have nullified
the whole acquisition.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.469
We expect higher standards.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.805
- It's an inexcusable oversight.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.141
- Yeah, uh, that's right.
We'll correct it in an addendum.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.144
Evelyn made one drafting error.

21:53.279 --> 21:55.245

21:58.484 --> 22:00.684

It was your idea to hire her.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.953

- We're late for Delano.

22:02.989 --> 22:03.754
- What?

22:03.889 --> 22:06.089
- I invited her to the office

22:06.125 --> 22:07.091
to talk over an offer.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.359
- Now?

22:08.428 --> 22:09.860
- Yeah.
- Jesus!

22:11.197 --> 22:12.329
Oh shit!

22:12.332 --> 22:14.432

Miranda Delano.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.535
It's a pleasure to meet you.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.070

our firm's paralegal, Evelyn.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.775

22:24.910 --> 22:26.977

to working with you.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.513

22:29.515 --> 22:32.783
- I will be taking over

22:36.155 --> 22:37.321

22:37.456 --> 22:39.322

22:39.359 --> 22:40.591

22:40.593 --> 22:41.892

to the conference room?

22:44.597 --> 22:46.664

22:46.799 --> 22:47.798

and professionals.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.130

23:21.734 --> 23:24.168
'Cause this is purely
a work offer.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.838

23:30.443 --> 23:31.575

23:32.745 --> 23:34.778

23:35.648 --> 23:37.347
- Here is
the business valuation

23:37.383 --> 23:39.183

of the capital structure

23:39.318 --> 23:41.852

of what you're getting into.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.753

23:47.693 --> 23:50.461

- We're at work.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.062
- Right...

23:53.666 --> 23:56.266
I had to write an addendum
on the Raymond contract.

23:56.302 --> 23:57.267

23:59.004 --> 24:01.638

Keas division.

24:02.541 --> 24:03.874

24:04.009 --> 24:04.942
- Yeah.

32:00.619 --> 32:01.551
that would be great.

32:01.620 --> 32:02.518
Thank you.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.023
Have a good day.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.295
(Saw whirring,
hammer pounding)

32:20.038 --> 32:21.070
(Doorbell ringing)

32:27.379 --> 32:30.847
- Hi. A man comes this early,
I expect some coffee.

32:30.883 --> 32:31.982
(Chuckling)

32:32.117 --> 32:33.816
Come in.
- I wasn't completely honest.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.552
We're not good.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.522
There's a problem with you
joing the firm,

32:39.591 --> 32:40.390
it's not gonna work.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.325
(Scoffing)

32:42.361 --> 32:43.693
- That's another first.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.429
Just full of surprises.

32:47.532 --> 32:48.598
- Yeah.

32:48.734 --> 32:52.536
Well, I'm sorry, but, uh,
we're withdrawing the offer.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.537
(Scoffing)

32:58.010 --> 33:00.510
- I hope you two will be
very happy together.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.190
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:11.190 --> 33:11.221
We, uh, we need to talk.
- After.
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:11.221 --> 33:12.956
We, uh, we need to talk.
- After.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.425
- No, this needs to happen now.
- Redemption first.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.027
We need to curry favour
with Keas.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.127
- Pat...

33:34.179 --> 33:36.245
(Sighing)

33:37.850 --> 33:39.516
- How much is Keas offering?

33:42.187 --> 33:46.189
- Well, uh, more than
Mrs. Raymond next door.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.493
Two hundred
and seventy-five thousand.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.867
- You hired her
to work her father

33:57.002 --> 33:58.168
and you didn't tell me?

33:58.303 --> 33:59.669
- Well, you might have
stopped me.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.671
I didn't know
where this fit on the board,

34:01.740 --> 34:04.140
above or below or--
- Oh, below. Definitely below.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.342
You're using her.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.144
- She got a job out of this.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.411
- Yeah, a job
she's terrible at.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.413
- Don't act all
high and mighty with me.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.149
You didn't offer
him the full 300 K.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.684
- Well, I need the money.
I'm taking your sister away.

34:14.686 --> 34:15.585
- Oh.

34:16.722 --> 34:17.787
- She's pregnant.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.690
- Wow!

34:20.759 --> 34:22.092
Um, congrats.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.360
- No, I don't deserve that.

34:23.495 --> 34:24.961
I'm fucking it all up.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.296
It's a mess.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.032
- OK.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.634
OK, you can go on vacation.

34:30.636 --> 34:33.336
I'll just ask Miranda
to start a few days earlier.

34:34.306 --> 34:37.107
- Yeah, about Miranda, um...

34:37.242 --> 34:40.010
had to rescind her offer
this morning.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.845
- I'm sorry,
you--you did what?

34:43.015 --> 34:44.981
- Look, it's complicated.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.782
Evelyn's jealous, and I...

34:47.920 --> 34:49.452
It doesn't matter.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.988
Just, Miranda's out.
- But, Keas...

34:52.024 --> 34:53.323
You're trying to ruin us.

34:53.392 --> 34:56.526
Do you have any idea the things
I've done for this firm?

34:56.661 --> 34:58.361
- Pat, come on.
- Fuck you, Phil. Fuck you!

34:58.497 --> 35:00.664
- I'll find a way
to make it work!

35:00.666 --> 35:01.865
(Door closing)

35:11.009 --> 35:12.608
(Door opening)

35:21.053 --> 35:22.619
Miranda is over.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.556
You're never gonna have to hear
her name or see her again.

35:27.759 --> 35:29.759
(Sighing)

35:29.761 --> 35:31.294
- What happened?

35:32.564 --> 35:33.497
Uh...

35:35.634 --> 35:36.966
she hit on me.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.603
And I should have put
a stop to it, I just...

35:41.773 --> 35:42.906
I don't know.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.509
I couldn't believe a woman
like that would be into me.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.179
- That hurts.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.981
- I'm sorry.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.719
Can we just hit
the reset button?

35:56.755 --> 35:58.487
Start over?

35:59.491 --> 36:01.658
- Yeah, I'd like
to change a few things.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.528
- And what would you change?

36:07.666 --> 36:11.267
- You remember when I met
your mom for the first time?

36:11.403 --> 36:13.336
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.470
I was so nervous,

36:14.506 --> 36:16.206
I drank too much
and I puked all over.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.208
(Laughing)

36:18.210 --> 36:19.943
- Yeah, you left
a lasting impression

36:20.012 --> 36:21.077
on the carpet.

36:21.079 --> 36:23.947
- Yeah, I'd like
a do-over on that.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.282
- Sure. Sure.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.282
(Chuckling)

36:26.418 --> 36:27.850
But what about the burp?

36:29.421 --> 36:31.221
- You'll have to
be more specific.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.055
(Laughing)

36:34.159 --> 36:35.394
- The burp.

36:35.394 --> 36:35.425
- Ah, the super romantic burp.
- The burp.

36:35.425 --> 36:37.961
- Ah, the super romantic burp.

36:37.963 --> 36:38.962
(Burping)

36:38.964 --> 36:41.030
- "I think I'm falling
in love with you."

36:41.066 --> 36:42.566
- Let's get rid of that one.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.500
(Laughing)

36:50.442 --> 36:52.508
- I want to have
a baby with you, Ev.

36:56.314 --> 36:58.014
The house is almost done.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.718
You're playing music again.

37:03.321 --> 37:04.788
You play the cello.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.590

You sleep.
I don't know.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.363
We'll figure it out together
like we always do.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.933

your breasts too?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.134
- Sure.

37:18.203 --> 37:19.869
Yeah, if there's a way,
I will.
