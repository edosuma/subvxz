WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.373
(door opens)
HEY, SWEETIE.

00:02.373 --> 00:04.775
LOOK WHO DROVE DOWN TO CHEER
YOU UP EVEN THOUGH I SAID

00:04.775 --> 00:07.508
IT WOULD BE OVERWHELMING TO WAIT
HAND AND FOOT ON TWO BOYS

00:07.508 --> 00:09.510
THE WHOLE WEEKEND.
LONG INTRO.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.741
LOVE SUCKS.

00:10.741 --> 00:13.614
YUP. LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.617
DID YOU JUST QUOTE PAT BENATAR?
OFTEN DO
IN TOUGH SITUATIONS.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.390
TRAV, IS THERE
ANY WAY I CAN HELP?

00:19.390 --> 00:21.392
I ASKED MY GIRLFRIEND
TO MARRY ME.

00:21.392 --> 00:23.394
SHE SAID NO
AND MOVED AWAY FOREVER.

00:23.394 --> 00:25.396
SO NO, I GUESS.
I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS.

00:25.396 --> 00:28.129
J-BIRD, YOU FIXIN'
TO MAKE LUNCH?

00:28.129 --> 00:30.131
HMM, PERFECT.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.404
I HAVE NEVER SEEN TRAVIS
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

00:33.404 --> 00:34.805
HEARTBREAK IS TOUGH.

00:34.805 --> 00:39.410
WHEN YOUR MOM PASSED,
I FELT LIKE MY LIFE WAS OVER.

00:39.410 --> 00:42.343
MORE MAYO, PLEASE.
I'M 70. WHO CARES?

00:42.343 --> 00:43.744
WHEN SMITH DUMPED ME,

00:43.744 --> 00:46.747
IT LITERALLY TOOK ME MONTHS
TO GET BACK TO A PLACE

00:46.747 --> 00:49.049
WHERE I COULD SLEEP
WITH RANDOM DUDES

00:49.049 --> 00:51.051
TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

00:52.283 --> 00:55.156
HAVE SOME CHIPS, SWEETIE.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.688
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

00:57.688 --> 01:00.361
SEE? JULES IS GLAD
TO HAVE HER DAD VISIT,

01:00.361 --> 01:02.833
BECAUSESHEUNDERSTANDS
THE VALUE OF FAMILY.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.465
HE IS JUST MAD

01:04.465 --> 01:07.067
BECAUSE HIS BROTHER IS PASSING
THROUGH ON THE WAY TO MIAMI,

01:07.067 --> 01:10.571
AND I DON'T WANT TO LET HIM
SPEND THE NIGHT WITH US.
YOU'RE BITCHING
ABOUT ONE NIGHT?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.643
EAT YOUR CHIPS, JELLY BEAN.
I DON'T WANNA.

01:12.643 --> 01:15.646
PLAY WITH THE BAG.
AND IT'S NOT JUST
MY BROTHER SHE WON'T LET VISIT.

01:15.646 --> 01:17.248
MY MOM, WHO IS SINGLE

01:17.248 --> 01:20.111
AND ACTUALLY QUITE HOT
FOR HER AGE--YOU'D LIKE HER.

01:20.111 --> 01:21.852
DON'T PIMP OUT YOUR MOM, SON.

01:21.852 --> 01:23.414
OH, YES, SIR.

01:23.414 --> 01:25.856
IS SHE HOT?
(grunts)

01:25.856 --> 01:27.688
HMM?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.590
WHAT?

01:29.590 --> 01:31.592
(crinkles)

01:31.592 --> 01:33.824
I'M GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU

01:33.824 --> 01:36.697
THAT I PROMISED
I WOULD NEVER SAY.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.699
I AGREE WITH ANDY.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.171
(gasps)
YES!

01:40.171 --> 01:43.204
I THINK HIS BROTHER SHOULD STAY.
FORGET FOR ONE SECOND

01:43.204 --> 01:45.736
THAT IF YOU LET ONE TOURIST
INTO YOUR HOME,

01:45.736 --> 01:48.339
EVERY SECOND AND THIRD COUSIN
ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD WILL

01:48.339 --> 01:51.842
DROP BY TO SAY HI. ANDY AND HIS
BROTHER DON'T SPEAK!

01:51.842 --> 01:53.784
NESTOR'S STILL PISSED
I NEVER LEARNED SPANISH,

01:53.784 --> 01:55.786
SO HE WON'T SPEAK TO ME
IN ENGLISH.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.789
(speaking Spanish)

02:01.352 --> 02:03.254
SERIOUSLY?

02:03.254 --> 02:06.227
AND THE WORST PART IS NESTOR'S
WIFE. JULES, SHE'S ALL OVER HIM.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.458
(chuckles)

02:07.458 --> 02:09.800
IT'S ONLY FOR ONE NIGHT.
I CAN GET YOU THROUGH THIS.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.703
(both speak Spanish)

02:12.703 --> 02:13.864
STOP IT.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.910
OKAY, I'M GONNA SIT OVER THERE.

02:19.910 --> 02:23.774
OH, HONEY, IT'S SO DARK IN HERE.
LET ME TURN SOME LIGHTS ON.

02:23.774 --> 02:26.777
(groans)
WELL, WE CAN KEEP IT DARK.
YOU KNOW, WE COULD BE

02:26.777 --> 02:30.721
LIKE MOLE PEOPLE. THEY'RE REAL,
YOU KNOW. THEY LIVE IN SEWERS--

02:30.721 --> 02:33.554
MOM, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE,
PLEASE.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.786
WELL, I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS
IF YOU NEED ME.

02:35.786 --> 02:38.229
(clicks teeth)

02:39.690 --> 02:42.293
NO. YOU ARE NOT GONNA
PLAY ROLLER HOCKEY AGAIN

02:42.293 --> 02:44.835
WITHOUT YOUR KNEE PADS. YOU'RE
NOT THAT GOOD OF A SKATER.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.837
HE'S LIKE A NEWBORN CALF
ON WHEELS.

02:46.837 --> 02:48.839
(chuckles)
NO, I'M NOT.

02:48.839 --> 02:51.302
CAN YOU PASS ME THOSE?

02:51.302 --> 02:53.274
AND I'M OFF. (chuckles)

02:53.274 --> 02:56.277
OKAY, HONEY, WHEN YOU FALL DOWN,
TRY TO FALL ON YOURBOTTOM.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.609
I LOVE YOU.
(Laurie) BYE, SHNOOKUMS.

02:58.609 --> 03:00.781
(singsongy)
LAND ON YOUR BOTTOM!

03:00.781 --> 03:03.754
(door closes)
MAN! YOU OVER-MOTHER G-WHIZ JUST
LIKE YOU'RE OVER-MOTHERING TRAV.

03:03.754 --> 03:07.258
YOU SHOULDN'T LET HIM JUST MOPE
AROUND UP IN HIS ROOM FOREVER.

03:07.258 --> 03:09.560
LET'S PUT TOGETHER
A LIST OF IDEAS.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.891
(clears throat)

03:10.891 --> 03:13.894
DANG IT. I HATE THAT
YOU NEVER HAVE A PEN AROUND.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.196
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
WRITE YOU THAT NOTE

03:16.196 --> 03:19.199
WHEN YOUR AUNT OR DOCTOR CALLED
ABOUT THAT HAPPY OR SAD THING.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.202
THIS IS MY FAULT. I SHOULD HAVE
WRITTEN A NOTE BY THE PHONE

03:22.202 --> 03:24.605
THAT SAYS, "BOBBY,
DO NOT ANSWER MY PHONE."

03:24.605 --> 03:27.478
OH. I WAS WRONG. HERE IT IS.

03:27.478 --> 03:30.481
WE COULD TAKE TRAV TO THE MINI
GOLF COURSE THAT JUST REOPENED.

03:30.481 --> 03:32.883
IT'S NOT A CRIME SCENE ANYMORE.
THEY FOUND THE HEAD.

03:32.883 --> 03:34.745
WINDMILL?
LIGHTHOUSE.

03:34.745 --> 03:36.787
WE COULD TAKE HIM
TO A STRIP CLUB.

03:36.787 --> 03:38.349
I'M IN.
DAD.

03:38.349 --> 03:40.521
SWEETIE, YOUR MOM IS DEAD,

03:40.521 --> 03:42.853
PLUS THERE'S BOOBS
EVERYWHERE.

03:42.853 --> 03:45.456
ALL RIGHT, NO ONE IS TAKING
MY SON ANYWHERE, OKAY?

03:45.456 --> 03:47.858
I MEAN, NOT TO THE SITE
OF THE PUTT-PUTT MURDERS

03:47.858 --> 03:50.331
AND DEFINITELY NOT
TO A NUDIE BAR.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.732
FINE, GOT IT.
OKAY.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.734
AND, DAD, TONIGHT,
WHEN I'M SAYING MY PRAYERS,

03:53.734 --> 03:55.936
I'M TELLING MOM WHAT YOU SAID.
OH, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.370
IT'S TOO LATE.
YOUR MOM HAD
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOBS.

03:59.370 --> 04:02.513
SHE REALLY DID.

04:02.513 --> 04:03.874
(doorbell rings)

04:03.874 --> 04:05.476
UGH. WHERE'S JULES?

04:05.476 --> 04:07.878
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA
HELP YOU GET THROUGH THIS.

04:07.878 --> 04:10.821
I'M GONNA BE OKAY
FOR A FEW MINUTES.
FINE.

04:10.821 --> 04:12.423
AAH! HEY, GIRLFRIEND!

04:12.423 --> 04:13.424
(door closes)
MWAH.

04:13.424 --> 04:14.785
OH. OH.

04:14.785 --> 04:17.728
MM--OOH. SOMEBODY TASTES
LIKE FANCY LOTION.
(door closes)

04:17.728 --> 04:20.030
FIGHTING THE AGE DRAGON,
HUH, SISTER?

04:20.030 --> 04:23.734
OOH. (imitates sword clinking)
STAY BACK! I WANT TO BE YOUNG!

04:23.734 --> 04:26.367
ACTUALLY, I--
(imitates sword sheathing)
NOWYOUCOME HERE, HANDSOME.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.670
WE'LL TALK LATER.
OH.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.972
(smooches)
OH, WOW, WE'RE LIP KISSING.
THAT'S, UH...

04:31.972 --> 04:34.675
(door closes)

04:34.675 --> 04:37.808
(speaks Spanish)

04:37.808 --> 04:40.781
YES, NESTOR,
I LEARNED SPANISH.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.956
I'M KIDDING.
I DIDN'T LEARN SPANISH.

04:45.956 --> 04:48.359
I JUST GUESSED
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

04:48.359 --> 04:51.362
(speaking Spanish)

04:53.324 --> 04:56.697
THANK YOU. IHAVELOST WEIGHT.
NOW I'M MAD AT YOU, BUSTER.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.430
OH, NO, BUSTER.
WHAT'D YOU DO?

04:59.430 --> 05:03.504
WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED
TO PUSH... HIS... BUTTONS?

05:03.504 --> 05:05.576
(laughs) THAT TICKLES.

05:05.576 --> 05:07.338
I BET THIS TICKLES, TOO.

05:07.338 --> 05:08.739
(Andy and Angela laugh)

05:08.739 --> 05:10.841
SHE'S PUSHING BUTTONS!

05:10.841 --> 05:13.444
LOOK AT THE POSITIVES.
ANDY IS GETTING FOREPLAY,

05:13.444 --> 05:16.887
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT.
DO I HEAR LAUGHING?

05:16.887 --> 05:19.650
(Angela) AND THREE AND FOUR.
All right, I'll be right there.

05:19.650 --> 05:22.653
(cell phone beeps)
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
YOU DIDN'T WEAR KNEE PADS,

05:22.653 --> 05:25.496
BECAUSE THE OTHER GUYS
WERE MAKING FUN OF YOU?

05:25.496 --> 05:28.058
(spritzing)
AND BECAUSE I'M NOT A BABY.
OW! OW, IT STINGS!

05:28.058 --> 05:30.030
BLOW ON IT, BLOW ON IT.
(inhales sharply)

05:30.030 --> 05:32.363
OOH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

05:32.363 --> 05:34.365
HEY. SCORED A GOAL TODAY.

05:34.365 --> 05:39.540
(men shouting indistinctly)

05:39.540 --> 05:41.872
(grunts)

05:41.872 --> 05:45.946
HA! THAT WAS--I SC--
THAT'S MY FIRST GOAL!

05:45.946 --> 05:47.818
THAT'S MY FIRST GOAL!

05:47.818 --> 05:49.820
IF YOU WON'T
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,

05:49.820 --> 05:51.782
THEN YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO PLAY ANYMORE.

05:51.782 --> 05:55.586
YOU'RE NOT MY MOM.
DON'T SASS ME.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

05:55.586 --> 05:58.529
NOW TAKE OFF YOUR DEATH SKATES,
AND I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.591
I'M GONNA ROLLERBLADE HOME.

06:00.591 --> 06:03.133
I'LL VISIT YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL.

06:03.133 --> 06:05.936
JULES.JULES, WAIT.
CAN YOU HELP ME DOWN?

06:05.936 --> 06:08.439
ALL RIGHT, WELL, COME HERE.
(spritzes)

06:08.439 --> 06:09.670
OW!

06:09.670 --> 06:11.972
(whines, blows) AHH.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.974
OH. WHERE'S TRAV?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.977
I WANTED TO CHECK IN ON HIM
BEFORE I GO SAVE ELLIE.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.480
(singsongy)
NEEDED BY EVERYONE. HELLO.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.814
YEAH, BOBBY COULDN'T FIND A PEN,
SO HE LEFT ME AS A NOTE.

06:23.814 --> 06:26.817
(imitates Bobby)
HEY, J-BIRD. I TOOK TRAV OUT

06:26.817 --> 06:30.421
WITH YOUR POPS TO GO SEE
SOME HOOTERS. DON'T WAIT UP.

06:30.421 --> 06:31.892
OH, BOY.

06:31.892 --> 06:36.827
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:43.534 --> 06:45.906
THEY BASICALLY KIDNAPPED TRAV
AND TOOK HIM TO A STRIP CLUB.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.979
I MEAN, THAT IS THE LAST THING
HE NEEDS RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?
TOTALLY.

06:48.979 --> 06:51.081
SO DO YOU THINK ANDY'S HAPPY?

06:51.081 --> 06:54.084
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
WE SHOULD HASH OUT RIGHT NOW.

06:54.084 --> 06:56.547
GOOD SEEING YOU, JULES.

06:56.547 --> 06:59.550
THIS IS HORRIBLE. I CAN'T
CRUSH HER, BECAUSE THAT WILL

06:59.550 --> 07:03.694
JUST EXPLODE IN A HUGE FAMILY
CRISIS FOR ANDY AND HIS BROTHER,

07:03.694 --> 07:06.697
BUT I NEED TO LET OUT MY MEAN.
HERE'S AN IDEA.

07:06.697 --> 07:09.960
JULES, YOU'LL BE
MY HUMAN STRESS BALL.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.563
ALL RIGHT.
WHEN I'M ABOUT
TO LOSE IT ON ANGELA,

07:12.563 --> 07:15.506
I'LL JUST CRAP ALL OVER YOU.
AH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
I'M LEAVING.

07:15.506 --> 07:16.907
WHAT? NO.
YES.

07:16.907 --> 07:18.138
STAY.
CAN'T.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.871
HAM.
CHEESE. ALL RIGHT.
I REALLY HAVE TO GO,

07:20.871 --> 07:23.474
BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY
PLAYING THIS GAME LATER.

07:23.474 --> 07:26.477
(door opens and closes)
STUPID STRIP CLUB. YOU KNOW,
IF THEY JUST WANTED TO SEE

07:26.477 --> 07:29.219
SOME DUMB TOWNY HO
FLOPPING HER TA-TAS,

07:29.219 --> 07:32.753
ALL THEY NEEDED TO DO
WAS STAY HERE AND GIVE $10 TO--

07:32.753 --> 07:37.127
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.
LET ME FINISH. YOU.

07:38.689 --> 07:41.862
(gasps) OH. WHO IS THAT
LITTLE PERSON IN YOUR HOUSE?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.463
THE COUSINS ARE COMING.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.497
FINE, JULES, YES,
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE STRIP CLUB.

07:46.497 --> 07:48.999
YEAH, I AM "BEING CAREFUL."

07:48.999 --> 07:52.002
HOLD ON. I GOT TO GO.
THERE'S A, UH...

07:52.002 --> 07:53.674
THERE'S A GUY HERE.
(beep)

07:53.674 --> 07:55.546
WHAT'S UP, LITTLE BALLER?

07:55.546 --> 07:59.680
PARENTS TAUGHT YOU NOT TO TALK
TO STRANGERS, DIDN'T THEY?

07:59.680 --> 08:03.884
SAY, UH... YOU WANT TO RIDE
TOGETHER FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

08:03.884 --> 08:07.988
YEAH? AW, YOU FEEL ME, PLAYBOY.
LET'S DO THIS. LET'S RIDE.

08:10.020 --> 08:13.023
NOW, TRAVIS, I DON'T WANT YOU
LOOKING LIKE A NANCY IN THERE,

08:13.023 --> 08:16.266
SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT MAKING IT RAIN.

08:16.266 --> 08:19.600
I LIKE A NICE $3 DRIZZLE.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.731
AWESOME.
(horn honks)

08:20.731 --> 08:23.704
(car door opens)
OH, SICK. MOM'S HERE.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.135
COME ON, TRAV. LET'S GO.

08:25.135 --> 08:27.578
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU TOOK YOUR SWING.

08:27.578 --> 08:29.980
NOW IT'S MY TURN, ALL RIGHT?
THE BOY NEEDS TO

08:29.980 --> 08:32.983
FORGET HIS TROUBLES BY STARING
AT SOME HONKS. COME ON.

08:32.983 --> 08:36.116
NO, NO. DON'T YOU DO THIS. DON'T
YOU DARE WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR!

08:36.116 --> 08:38.719
DON'T YOU DARE WALK
THROUGH THAT SECOND DOOR!

08:38.719 --> 08:43.193
COME ON. COME ON, HON.
HERE, HAVE SOME SINGLES.

08:43.193 --> 08:45.796
IS THIS WHY
YOU ALWAYS HAVE SINGLES?

08:45.796 --> 08:48.198
YEAH. (chuckles)

08:48.198 --> 08:49.800
(snorts)

08:49.800 --> 08:51.201
I DON'T KNOW, EITHER.

08:51.201 --> 08:55.035
OKAY. HERE SHE COMES.
TRY NOT TO ENJOY HER...

08:55.035 --> 08:57.738
(whispers) SKANKY GRAB-ASS...
(normal voice) SO MUCH.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.110
OOH, LOOK AT THIS GUY.

09:00.110 --> 09:03.243
OH, HERE'S SOME FOR YOU
SO YOU DON'T GET JEALOUS.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.847
MMM. I'M SORRY,
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.048
OH. OKAY.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.650
(chuckles)

09:09.650 --> 09:13.754
SO, UM... ANGELA,
HOW ARE THINGS WITH NESTOR?

09:13.754 --> 09:16.226
OH! I AM SO LUCKY
TO HAVE HIM.

09:16.226 --> 09:19.229
I MEAN, NESTOR IS KIND
AND HANDSOME AND HE WORSHIPS ME,

09:19.229 --> 09:22.562
AND OLD FANTASIES,
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE JUST THAT--

09:22.562 --> 09:25.896
FANTASIES. THEY'RE NEVER
REALLY GONNA HAPPEN.

09:25.896 --> 09:28.238
GOOD FOR YOU.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU NEVER KNOW.

09:28.238 --> 09:30.270
THINGS CHANGE. PEOPLE DIE.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.802
(door opens)

09:31.802 --> 09:32.803
WHAT?

09:32.803 --> 09:34.204
(door closes)
(sputters)

09:34.204 --> 09:35.806
WHAT? WHAT?

09:35.806 --> 09:39.249
IF I GET MURDERED, I NEED YOU
TO TELL THE POLICE SOMETHING.

09:39.249 --> 09:42.082
SERIOUSLY?
IF I HAD A DIME...
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.685
THERE ARE THREE THINGS
I WOULD NEVER MISS--

09:44.685 --> 09:47.087
YOU GETTING TORTURED,
BOY BAND REUNION CONCERTS,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.089
AND VIDEOS OF HORSES
GIVING BIRTH.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.993
ELLIE, THEY COME OUT
LOOKING LIKE PONIES!
I'VE SEEN IT.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.995
LAURIE... (speaks Spanish)

09:54.995 --> 09:58.298
(speaks Spanish)

09:58.298 --> 10:01.101
COME ON!

10:01.101 --> 10:03.974
OOH, IT'S DEAD IN HERE.
LET'S GO.

10:03.974 --> 10:06.106
WE CAN'T SCRAP
YOUR GENIUS PLAN NOW.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.909
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU GRAB
A TABLE NEAR THE POLE?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.340
EXCUSE ME.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.382
FOLLOW ME, GRANDPA.

10:12.382 --> 10:15.986
I JUST SAID, "FOLLOW ME,
GRANDPA" IN A STRIP CLUB.

10:15.986 --> 10:18.388
EXCUSE ME, MISS? ARE THERE
ANY NAKED LADIES AROUND

10:18.388 --> 10:20.791
THAT COULD SHAKE IT
FOR MY FAMILY?

10:20.791 --> 10:22.152
IT'S JUST ME.

10:22.152 --> 10:26.096
EVERYONE ELSE IS PICKING
THEIR KIDS UP FROM SCHOOL.
THAT'S HOT.

10:26.096 --> 10:29.629
(bottle clinks)
I'M SUPPOSED TO NUDE UP
IF ANYONE COMES IN.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.961
(rock music playing)

10:30.961 --> 10:34.404
(sets bottle down)
ALMOST GOT THROUGH MY SHIFT.

10:35.906 --> 10:37.367
(glass clatters)

10:37.367 --> 10:42.112
(woman) в™Є I'M MYSTIFIED,
CAUGHT UP INSIDE OF THIS в™Є

10:42.112 --> 10:44.975
в™Є YOU'VE GOT ME
WHERE YOU WANT ME THIS TIME в™Є

10:44.975 --> 10:46.847
(grunts)
(sets glass down)

10:46.847 --> 10:50.921
YOU GO, GIRL.
THIS IS FOR THERAPY.

10:50.921 --> 10:54.384
SO, TRAV, YOU WANT TO
SPLIT SOME CURLY FRIES?

10:54.384 --> 10:57.027
NOT UNLESS IT COMES
WITH A GUN.

10:57.027 --> 10:58.959
WOW, THAT'S A BIG HILL.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.932
I'M NOT REALLY GREAT
ATSTOPPING,YOU KNOW?

11:01.932 --> 11:04.264
HEY, STRIP CLUB'S
DOWN THERE, RIGHT?

11:04.264 --> 11:07.798
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT
ONCE YOU START CHASING TAIL.

11:07.798 --> 11:11.071
JUST BE CAREFUL ABOUT
GETTING INTORELATIONSHIPS.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.904
(chuckles) NOW ONCE A GAL
GETS HER HOOKS IN,

11:13.904 --> 11:18.108
THEN IT BECOMES ALL ABOUT
CONTROLLING YOU.

11:18.108 --> 11:20.911
HONESTLY, SOMETIMES
YOU START TO WONDER

11:20.911 --> 11:24.715
IF YOU TWO ARE EVEN
TRULY MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

11:24.715 --> 11:27.117
I MEAN, JUST ONCE,
I WISH JULES WOULD SENSE

11:27.117 --> 11:30.721
WHEN I NEED TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME...

11:30.721 --> 11:34.064
EVEN IF ITISSTUPID.

11:34.064 --> 11:35.425
(scoffs)

11:35.425 --> 11:38.468
OH, BOY. OKAY.
HOW MUCH I OWE YOU, DOC?

11:38.468 --> 11:42.072
(chuckles) MY BAD.
LET'S DO THIS. YOU READY?

11:42.072 --> 11:43.473
(dog barking in distance)

11:43.473 --> 11:46.807
AS FAR AS YOU GO, HUH?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.809
(Southern accent, deep voice)
WELL, BROTHER,

11:48.809 --> 11:52.282
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR RIDING WITH
YOU. (normal voice) SEE YOU.

11:54.284 --> 11:57.487
(Andy) YEAH!
(inhales sharply) IF SOMEONE
WAS UP ONMYMAN LIKE THAT,

11:57.487 --> 12:00.150
I WOULD LACE UP
MY ASS-KICKING BOOTS.
(speaking indistinctly)

12:00.150 --> 12:03.223
'COURSE, IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT
45 MINUTES. THEY GO UP TO HERE.
'COURSE.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.126
JUST BE HONEST WITH ME. YOU'RE
REALLY NOT WEARING COLOGNE?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.727
THAT'S YOUR NATURAL SMELL?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.329
IT IS, I SWEAR.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.862
(sniffs, whispers) WOW.

12:11.862 --> 12:13.063
(Andy) YEAH.

12:13.063 --> 12:16.736
I BET I COULD CRAM
A WHOLE TURKEY IN YOUR MOUTH.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.970
WHAT? I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO YOU.
I GOT TO GET THE MEAN OUT.

12:19.970 --> 12:22.212
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
BUT I'M NOT JULES.

12:22.212 --> 12:24.214
I DON'T WANT TO BE
YOUR STRESS BALL.

12:24.214 --> 12:26.947
I LOVE YOGA.
DO YOU LOVE YOGA?
NO.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.880
OH, IT'S SO GOOD. I FEEL VERY
LIMBER WITH IT. LIKE, WATCH.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.953
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
WOW. OKAY. YEAH.
MM-HMM.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.354
YOUR TOES ARE HUGE!

12:34.354 --> 12:37.087
IT'S LIKE LOOKING
AT A SANDAL FULL OF BRATWURST!

12:37.087 --> 12:40.961
I AM VERY SENSITIVE
ABOUT MY SAUSAGE TOES.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.094
YOU'RE GONNA HURT MY FEELINGS.
PLEASE STOP.

12:44.094 --> 12:45.495
AND BREATHE...
(coughs)

12:45.495 --> 12:47.838
AND BREATHE...
OH!

12:47.838 --> 12:49.239
(Andy) UH, EVERYWHERE.

12:49.239 --> 12:50.841
(Angela) YEAH, IT'S GOOD,
ISN'T IT?

12:50.841 --> 12:51.842
DON'T.

12:51.842 --> 12:53.343
(Andy) OH, MY GOD.

12:53.343 --> 12:56.046
(Angela) IT HELPS
RELEASE THE TOXINS.
OH! I THINK I JUST...

12:56.046 --> 12:58.048
SOMETIMES YOU LOOK
LIKE A DUDE.

12:58.048 --> 12:59.409
AAH!

12:59.409 --> 13:02.913
DON'T GO!
(whispers) COME BACK.

13:02.913 --> 13:05.385
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO DO ANYTHING ANYMORE.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.388
I DON'T WANT TO EAT, SHOWER,
PUT ON SUNSCREEN...

13:08.388 --> 13:11.992
I MEAN, ULTIMATELY,
I PUT ON SUNSCREEN. I HAVE TO.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.224
I'M A PALE WEIRDO.

13:14.224 --> 13:16.827
(sighs) MAYBE THAT'S
WHY SHE LEFT ME.

13:16.827 --> 13:19.099
I MEAN, I...

13:19.099 --> 13:21.832
LOVED HER,

13:21.832 --> 13:24.274
AND SHE JUST...

13:24.274 --> 13:26.276
WALKED AWAY.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.878
(sighs)
(thump)

13:27.878 --> 13:30.981
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE?

13:30.981 --> 13:34.314
MY FIANCГ© WAS MURDERED
BY A DRUG LORD.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.247
SO YOU GET IT.

13:37.247 --> 13:40.020
GRAYSON,
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.852
TOO FAST!

13:41.852 --> 13:44.995
AAH!

13:44.995 --> 13:46.596
(thud)
OHH!

13:46.596 --> 13:50.360
SO HOW'S THIS GOING?
DO YOU FEEL LIKE A GOOD DAD?

13:50.360 --> 13:52.162
YEAH, I'M CRUSHING IT.

13:52.162 --> 13:54.364
OH,
YOU WERE TALKING TO HIM.

13:54.364 --> 13:56.967
SO I'M THE BAD PARENT
JUST BECAUSE I'M TRYING

13:56.967 --> 13:59.269
TO CLEAN UP THE MESS
THAT YOU CREATED.

13:59.269 --> 14:02.342
DID YOU HEAR HIM?
NO, I'M JUST AN OLD MAN
EATING FRIES.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.344
YOU BABY THAT BOY SO MUCH,

14:04.344 --> 14:06.476
HE HAS NO IDEA
HOW TO DEAL WITH PAIN,

14:06.476 --> 14:09.479
AND NOW HE HITS ONE BUMP
IN THE ROAD, AND HE FALLS APART.
AT LEAST I WAS THERE.

14:09.479 --> 14:12.082
YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS
OF BEING AN OKAY DAD

14:12.082 --> 14:15.085
DOESN'T MAKE UP
FOR 17 OF BEING A CRAPPY ONE.

14:15.085 --> 14:17.527
YOU'RE GONNA PLAY
THAT CARD AGAIN?

14:17.527 --> 14:20.430
I'M DONE TALKING TO YOU.
TRAVIS, LET'S GO!

14:20.430 --> 14:23.964
OH, HE TOOK YOUR KEYS
AND LEFT.
WHAT?

14:23.964 --> 14:26.366
HE ALSO SAID THAT
YOU'D GIVE ME A RIDE HOME.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.999
IF I'M LATE,
MY BOYFRIEND LOCKS ME OUT.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.341
FANTASTIC.

14:38.909 --> 14:41.311
YOUR FAULT TRAV LEFT.
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

14:41.311 --> 14:44.915
WELL, THEN WHO'S GONNA TELL ME
I'M A CRAPPY PARENT?
YOU CAN JUST ASK ANYONE.

14:44.915 --> 14:47.257
YEAH, BUT--
STOP. NOT TALKING.

14:47.257 --> 14:50.560
ARE THOSE TWO
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

14:50.560 --> 14:52.122
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER,
HONEY.

14:52.122 --> 14:54.124
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED
FOR YEARS.

14:54.124 --> 14:56.266
WELL,
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

14:56.266 --> 14:57.667
ARE WE TALKING NOW?
NOPE.

14:57.667 --> 15:00.600
DANG IT. I HAD A ZINGER.
(click)

15:00.600 --> 15:03.403
(pounds on door)

15:03.403 --> 15:07.207
HEY! UNLOCK THE DOOR!

15:07.207 --> 15:10.040
(groans)

15:10.040 --> 15:12.282
IT'S YOU.
WOW, IT IS CRAZY

15:12.282 --> 15:16.516
HOW MUCH YOU LOOK
LIKE ME AS A KID.

15:16.516 --> 15:20.320
ARE YOU EVEN REAL?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.954
ARE YOU--YOU ME?

15:23.954 --> 15:27.297
(tires screech)
HOW'S THE SKATING GOING?

15:27.297 --> 15:30.230
HEY, DID YOU GUYS
SEE A LITTLE KID?

15:30.230 --> 15:31.461
WHAT KID?

15:31.461 --> 15:33.063
WHOA.

15:33.063 --> 15:36.036
OH, THERE HE IS.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.437
HEY, HOP IN.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.440
YOU CAN RIDE ON MY DAD'S LAP.
NOT AS MUCH FUN AS DESTINY,

15:40.440 --> 15:43.143
BUT HE DOES HAVE
A FEMININE FRAME.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.976
WOW, YOU'RE LONELY.
I REALLY AM.

15:45.976 --> 15:49.019
LOOK, I SAID I WAS BLADING HOME,
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

15:49.019 --> 15:51.421
OHH, GRAYSON.
JUST GET IN, G-LOVE.
COME ON.

15:51.421 --> 15:53.423
NO, NO, NO.
GUYS, LEAVE HIM ALONE.

15:53.423 --> 15:56.186
HE NEEDS TO DO THIS.
DON'T YOU?

15:56.186 --> 16:01.331
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER SAID
ANYTHING THAT MEANS MORE TO ME.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.095
SHE REALLY LOVES THIS FRUIT?

16:05.095 --> 16:07.437
HMM.
YEAH. HE'S ALL RIGHT.

16:07.437 --> 16:10.070
HEY, JELLY BEAN.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.272
I'M SORRY. I JUST--

16:12.272 --> 16:13.543
SERIOUSLY?

16:13.543 --> 16:16.306
COME ON.
HOW IS THAT NOT FUNNY?

16:16.306 --> 16:17.307
(scoffs)

16:17.307 --> 16:18.708
LOOK, I AM REALLY SORRY.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.710
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
USED YOU LIKE THAT.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.312
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

16:22.312 --> 16:25.315
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
COME OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT,

16:25.315 --> 16:27.317
AND I'LL COOK
ALL YOUR FAVORITES--

16:27.317 --> 16:30.290
NACHOS, PIZZA ROLLS,
WIENER SNIGGLETS,

16:30.290 --> 16:33.723
OR WHATEVER IT ELSE IS THAT
YOU WOLF DOWN YOUR CAKE FACE.

16:33.723 --> 16:36.726
I KNOW YOU JUST WANT ME THERE
TO BE YOUR PUNCHING BAG,

16:36.726 --> 16:39.699
AND EVEN THOUGH NOW I AM MAJORLY
JONESING FOR WIENER SNIGGLETS,

16:39.699 --> 16:42.572
WHATEVER THE HELL THOSE ARE,
YOU CAN FORGET IT.

16:42.572 --> 16:46.036
I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES IT FEELS
LIKE YOU AND I JUST TOLERATE

16:46.036 --> 16:49.039
EACH OTHER FOR JULES, BUT I'D
LIKE TO BELIEVE IN MY HEART

16:49.039 --> 16:53.183
THAT WHEN IT REALLY MATTERS...
WE'D BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER?

16:53.183 --> 16:54.644
EVENYOUDON'T BELIEVE THAT!

16:54.644 --> 16:57.647
YOU PUT A QUESTION MARK
AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE!

16:57.647 --> 17:01.191
IDOBELIEVE IT. DEEP DOWN
I REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU?

17:01.191 --> 17:03.493
YOU DID IT AGAIN! UGH!

17:03.493 --> 17:06.496
(loudly) BUT WE'RE FRIENDS?
YOU'RE PRETTY?

17:06.496 --> 17:10.600
YOUR HAT'S NOT DUMB AT ALL?

17:10.600 --> 17:13.133
I'M DOING IT! (laughs)

17:13.133 --> 17:15.635
I'M DOING IT! (laughs)

17:15.635 --> 17:19.209
YOU LOOK GREAT, BABY!
(smooches)

17:19.209 --> 17:22.342
J-BIRD, IF I WANT TO SAY
I'M SORRY, CAN WE TALK AGAIN?

17:22.342 --> 17:24.274
YEAH, OKAY.

17:24.274 --> 17:26.276
WELL, I DON'T!
GET OUT!

17:26.276 --> 17:29.249
I HATE YOU! DIE!
I HATE YOU!

17:29.249 --> 17:31.351
AAH! WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING UP THERE? HUH?

17:31.351 --> 17:33.323
COME ON. THAT'S ENOUGH.
(groans)

17:33.323 --> 17:38.057
JULES, WHEN YOU WERE 15, YOU HAD
THE FLATTEST CHEST IN TOWN.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.659
DAD, WHY?
EVERY NIGHT,

17:39.659 --> 17:42.662
I HEARD YOU CRYING YOUR EYES OUT
OVER IT, AND I FOUND MYSELF

17:42.662 --> 17:45.665
PRAYING TO THE BOOB FAIRY
FOR 'EM TO COME IN,

17:45.665 --> 17:48.398
BECAUSE I JUST WANTED IT
TO WORK OUT FOR YOU.

17:48.398 --> 17:50.770
IT DID.
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.243
ONE BOOB'S GREAT
AND THE OTHER ONE'S PERFECT.

17:53.243 --> 17:54.604
OH, THANKS.

17:54.604 --> 17:59.078
WELL, IT TOOKOVER A YEAR,
AND THE MORE IT CRUSHED YOU,

17:59.078 --> 18:01.080
SWEETIE, THE MORE
IT JUST KILLED ME,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.713
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
FIX IT FOR YOU.

18:03.713 --> 18:06.316
DON'T YOU DUMMIES GET IT?

18:06.316 --> 18:08.718
YOU'RE NOT REALLY MAD
AT EACH OTHER.

18:08.718 --> 18:10.520
YOU'RE JUST FRUSTRATED

18:10.520 --> 18:12.522
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME,

18:12.522 --> 18:15.525
TRAV HAS A PROBLEM THAT NEITHER
ONE OF YOU CAN FIX FOR HIM,

18:15.525 --> 18:17.567
AND THAT HURTS,

18:17.567 --> 18:20.770
AND SO WHAT YOU OUGHT TO BE
DOING INSTEAD OF FIGHTING

18:20.770 --> 18:24.374
IS TRYING TO TAKE CARE
OF EACH OTHER.

18:24.374 --> 18:29.439
(Matt Hires)
в™Є SAIL YOUR SHIP ACROSS MY SEA в™Є

18:29.439 --> 18:30.840
в™Є AND I'LL SEE YOU в™Є

18:30.840 --> 18:33.443
WHOA! OHH!

18:33.443 --> 18:34.884
(wheels screech, thud)
OHH!

18:34.884 --> 18:36.146
OH!

18:36.146 --> 18:38.788
I MADE IT HOME! HA HA!

18:38.788 --> 18:40.750
I'M--OH, GOD.

18:40.750 --> 18:44.554
(sighs)
I MADE DINNER. ENJOY.

18:44.554 --> 18:46.556
GOOD. I'M STARVING.

18:46.556 --> 18:47.557
OHH.

18:47.557 --> 18:49.329
HE'S HUNGRY.
THAT'S ADORABLE.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.560
HOW IS THAT ADORABLE?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.562
OH, ELLIE.
YOU ONLY SEE FROM HERE.

18:52.562 --> 18:54.564
TRY SEEING FROM HERE.
(door opens)

18:54.564 --> 18:56.566
(door closes)

18:56.566 --> 18:58.268
OKAY, BREATHE.

18:58.268 --> 19:00.470
в™Є YOUR STRESS BALL
HAS ARRIVED в™Є

19:00.470 --> 19:03.413
JELLY BEAN,
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME.
YEAH.

19:03.413 --> 19:05.815
I WORE SANDALS
