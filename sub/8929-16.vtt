Hm. Curious.

Though I am close to these rugged lands,

they still have their secrets.

01:17.879 --> 01:19.345

01:56.052 --> 01:58.852
How's your title research going?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.352
Mm, got some odd anomalies.

02:01.452 --> 02:03.853
It would almost seem that one of the moons

02:03.953 --> 02:06.186
is lighter than it should be.

02:06.286 --> 02:09.087
Not enough mass for its size.

02:09.187 --> 02:12.888
It's as though it were hollow.

02:12.988 --> 02:15.188
Hm. Instrument error?

So, uh, what's new, pussycat?

Any Pred prowlers up there?

02:43.626 --> 02:45.160

02:45.260 --> 02:47.260
This is a peaceful land, Rattrap.

06:05.226 --> 06:09.760
Let's gather some fragments. Megatron will want proof.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.494
Waspinator wants his head.

Hm.

06:34.331 --> 06:37.832
Hey! Wait for Waspinator!

This is Optimus Primal. Anyone hear me?

06:54.401 --> 06:55.635
We hear you, big bot.

06:55.735 --> 06:58.202
What's the sitch? Where's my fellow cat bot?

06:58.302 --> 07:00.702
This place has seen some heavy action.

07:00.803 --> 07:02.803
And it doesn't look good.

07:02.903 --> 07:06.570
Tigatron's footprints lead to a broken cliff edge.

07:06.670 --> 07:10.637
We have to face a grim possibility, team.

07:10.737 --> 07:12.638
Tigatron

07:12.738 --> 07:14.938
may have been destroyed.

CHEETOR: Say it ain't so, big bot!

07:25.406 --> 07:27.306
Not our striped scout!

07:27.406 --> 07:29.574
This place is a battleground.

07:29.673 --> 07:31.941
Blast craters and missile debris everywhere.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.941
From the angle, it was an aerial attack.

07:36.041 --> 07:39.775
Hm. Waspinator and Terrorsaur.

07:39.875 --> 07:43.276
Oh, thanks for the insight there, dino brain.

07:43.376 --> 07:45.676
You want your expert consultant fee now?

07:45.776 --> 07:47.709
No need.

07:47.810 --> 07:51.044
I can simply accept it from your hide.

07:51.144 --> 07:52.178
RHINOX: Hey!

07:52.278 --> 07:55.011
Not now!

07:58.345 --> 07:59.245
Ugh!

07:59.345 --> 08:01.179
If Tigatron's been scrapped,

08:01.279 --> 08:03.013
there ought to be a few components.

08:03.113 --> 08:04.979
Haven't found any.

08:05.079 --> 08:06.747
But he's not answering the comm link.

08:06.846 --> 08:10.181
Destroyed or captured, he's not around here.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.414
( dramatic theme playing )

08:19.615 --> 08:21.949
Hoo!

08:28.317 --> 08:30.717
Either the grunge look is coming back,

08:30.817 --> 08:33.984
or those two ran into something hot.

08:34.084 --> 08:36.652
I'd better report.

08:36.752 --> 08:38.485
( growling ): What?

08:38.585 --> 08:40.852
Tigatron did this to you?

08:40.952 --> 08:44.186
Oh, no. Not just Tigatron.

08:44.286 --> 08:46.920
It-- It was um, a monument!

08:47.020 --> 08:48.620
Yeah, a monument.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.654
Explain yourselves.

08:50.754 --> 08:54.121
We-- We thought Tigatron was finished.

08:54.221 --> 08:59.022
We followed him, as he fell into uh, a cloud.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.789
But inside, it was not just a cloud.

09:41.062 --> 09:44.863
We barely made it back.

09:44.963 --> 09:46.696
( grunts )

09:48.464 --> 09:52.098
Hm. A flying island. Concealed from view.

09:52.198 --> 09:54.931
Which contains a powerful weapon.

09:55.031 --> 09:58.932
This could be useful. Yes.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.765
Such a tactical advantage

10:00.865 --> 10:03.866
could end the beast wars once and for all.

10:03.966 --> 10:07.467
Get to the CR chamber.

10:07.567 --> 10:08.733
( grunts ) ( groans )

10:08.834 --> 10:11.800
Blackarachnia, Scorponok, Wha--?

10:11.900 --> 10:14.734
MEGATRON: prepare for immediate departure to that flying island.

10:14.835 --> 10:16.035
Ugh.

10:16.135 --> 10:18.701
You don't think it might be wise to first discover

10:18.801 --> 10:20.969
who created such an artifact?

10:21.069 --> 10:22.203
Or why?

10:22.302 --> 10:24.603
Do not question my orders!

10:24.702 --> 10:26.403
Time enough for such inquiries

10:26.503 --> 10:28.937
when we control the island's power.

10:29.037 --> 10:31.070
But Tigatron is there already.

10:31.170 --> 10:35.604
He must be eliminated before he can alert the other Maximals.

10:35.704 --> 10:36.938
Now go!

10:37.038 --> 10:39.738
Oh, all right.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.472
Shell head, let's move.

10:41.572 --> 10:43.939
Uh, one moment, Scorponok.

10:44.039 --> 10:46.173
Hm?

10:46.272 --> 10:48.607
( whispering indistinctly )

10:48.706 --> 10:50.707
( suspenseful theme playing )

10:57.141 --> 11:00.042
Hm.

11:05.509 --> 11:07.076
You're sure of this?

11:07.176 --> 11:10.577
Positive. It was Terrorsaur and Waspinator.

11:10.677 --> 11:13.110
And they were seriously slagged.

11:13.211 --> 11:14.411
Almost scrap.

11:14.511 --> 11:18.512
Not Tigatron, then. That's not his style.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.745
No. He'll defend himself,

11:20.846 --> 11:23.812
but total destruction is against everything he believes in.

11:23.912 --> 11:25.680
He is a fool, then.

11:25.780 --> 11:28.746
Eh, when it comes to Preds, I gotta agree with you.

11:28.847 --> 11:30.980
Especially certain ones.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.280
( Dinobot growls )

11:32.380 --> 11:35.848
Whoa! Heads up, fellow bots, movement at Pred central.

11:35.948 --> 11:37.615
Blackarachnia and Scorponok are headed out,

11:37.715 --> 11:39.048
and they're not wasting time.

11:39.148 --> 11:42.216
Airazor, can you follow them? But without them seeing you?

11:42.316 --> 11:44.249
Easily.

11:44.349 --> 11:46.050
Beast mode.

11:48.050 --> 11:50.050
( dramatic theme playing )

11:56.251 --> 12:00.219
Man, something's got Megatron's scaly tail in a ringer.

12:00.319 --> 12:03.385
Hey, maybe it's Tigatron. Maybe he's still alive.

12:03.486 --> 12:05.053
We can only hope.

12:05.153 --> 12:09.186
But if the Predacons reach him first,

12:09.286 --> 12:12.287
he may not survive much longer.

12:40.492 --> 12:43.392
Truly, this is a land of wonder.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.360
Here in the frozen north,

12:51.460 --> 12:56.194
this tiny tropical ecosystem somehow exists.

12:59.795 --> 13:02.195
Yet it is hidden.

13:03.362 --> 13:04.262
( rumbling )

13:04.362 --> 13:06.596

13:09.730 --> 13:11.064

( panting )

13:57.872 --> 14:00.072
( growls )

14:06.873 --> 14:09.406
It would seem that energy weapons are not welcome

14:09.507 --> 14:12.874
in this peaceful land. So be it.

14:12.974 --> 14:14.074
Beast mode.

14:16.875 --> 14:21.075
Let me be a visitor, not an invader.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.575
( dramatic theme playing )

14:29.643 --> 14:31.444
There it is.

14:31.544 --> 14:33.444
Waspinator and Terrorsaur

14:33.544 --> 14:35.711
are not exactly the brightest witnesses.

14:35.811 --> 14:37.677
But the description fits.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.645
The flying island must be inside.

14:42.979 --> 14:44.079
I'll check.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.013
( buzzing )

14:50.113 --> 14:51.380
Cyberbee launch.

14:55.114 --> 14:56.914
On visual.

15:12.750 --> 15:16.284
( beeping rapidly)

15:28.553 --> 15:29.453
( grunts )

15:29.553 --> 15:30.553
( growling )

15:30.653 --> 15:31.887
( gasping )

15:31.987 --> 15:36.454
Oh, what's with you, shell head? Is it there?

15:36.554 --> 15:39.255
Yeah. So's Tigatron.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.989
So the pussycat's still alive, is he?

15:44.089 --> 15:46.155
We'll take care of that.

15:46.256 --> 15:49.323
Blackarachnia, terrorize!

15:49.423 --> 15:51.423
( dramatic rock theme playing )

15:59.192 --> 16:00.424
What's this?

16:00.525 --> 16:05.325
Blackarachnia tries to lasso a cloud?

16:05.425 --> 16:08.093
More surprisingly,

16:08.193 --> 16:10.860
she seems to have succeeded.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.327
Let's check this out.

16:13.427 --> 16:14.628
Uh-oh.

16:21.695 --> 16:22.662
( buzzes )

16:22.762 --> 16:24.629
Uh-uh.

16:24.729 --> 16:27.663
One of Scorponok's spying cyberbees?

16:27.763 --> 16:32.130
This land of peace may not be peaceful much longer.

16:32.230 --> 16:34.631
Still, it may be useful.

16:37.331 --> 16:38.231
( Airazor screeches )

16:38.331 --> 16:39.331
Hm?

16:57.101 --> 16:59.102
( suspenseful theme playing )

17:20.338 --> 17:21.639
Yes!

17:21.739 --> 17:23.839
( cackles )

17:23.939 --> 17:26.006

17:26.106 --> 17:27.740

17:41.275 --> 17:43.342
Wow!

17:43.442 --> 17:46.843
That's a real blaster!

17:46.943 --> 17:48.609
BLACKARACHNIA: Notice that, did you?

17:48.709 --> 17:51.143
Well, in case you didn't notice,

17:51.243 --> 17:54.343
it is activated by our own weapons. I must--

17:54.443 --> 17:55.344
Huh?

17:55.444 --> 18:00.045
I mean, we must take control of it.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.745
But carefully.

18:11.613 --> 18:13.180
TIGATRON: Airazor.

18:13.281 --> 18:15.681
( groans )

18:15.781 --> 18:18.248
Lie still. You've been hit.

18:18.347 --> 18:22.282
Your beast form will make repairs,

18:22.382 --> 18:24.182
but it will take time.

18:24.282 --> 18:26.815
Oh. But-- But--

18:26.916 --> 18:28.583
Blackarachnia--

18:28.683 --> 18:31.183
And Scorponok--? Oh.

18:31.284 --> 18:32.917
I intercepted one of Scorponok's cyberbees.

18:33.017 --> 18:37.551
I was able to reprogram it while you were unconscious.

18:37.651 --> 18:40.485
With luck, it should reach Maximal base

18:40.585 --> 18:43.185
right about now.

18:45.052 --> 18:47.386
Good thing you didn't just blast this bee.

18:47.486 --> 18:48.686
Well, I would've,

18:48.786 --> 18:51.953
but it was carrying one of Airazor's feathers.

18:52.053 --> 18:54.154
Besides, he missed.

18:54.254 --> 18:58.454
Yeah, that too.

18:58.555 --> 19:03.155
Prime. Here goes.

19:12.990 --> 19:15.291
Hey, it's Tigatron.

19:18.457 --> 19:21.125
Attention, Maximals,

19:21.225 --> 19:23.926
This is a code one emergency message from Tigatron.

19:24.026 --> 19:26.393
Airazor has been damaged.

19:26.493 --> 19:29.693
She and I are trapped on a mysterious flying island.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.060
This island is a self-contained ecosystem

19:34.160 --> 19:38.061
guarded by powerful weapons of alien design.

19:38.161 --> 19:41.328
Blackarachnia and Scorponok have already managed to invade.

19:41.428 --> 19:44.762
If they gain control of the island and its weapons,

19:44.862 --> 19:47.963
The Predacons will be able to destroy the Maximal base...

19:48.063 --> 19:48.963
What!

19:49.063 --> 19:52.130
...and win the beast wars.

19:52.230 --> 19:54.430
( static )

19:54.530 --> 19:56.464
NARRATOR: Next time, on Beast Wars:

19:56.565 --> 19:58.164
OPTIMUS: Evacuate Maximal base!

19:58.264 --> 20:00.631
Scramble! Scramble!

20:00.731 --> 20:02.432
( screaming )

20:02.532 --> 20:04.232
( screaming )

20:07.799 --> 20:09.033
( gasps )

20:09.133 --> 20:12.500
The Predacons have almost reached the obelisk.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.667
We must stop them!

20:21.335 --> 20:23.101
( screams )

20:23.202 --> 20:25.835
Now for power.

20:33.470 --> 20:38.204
May I be forgiven for what I must do?

20:48.239 --> 20:50.273
( dramatic theme playing )
