since you did the summer reading,

08:26.333 --> 08:29.125
I'll ask you the first question
we apparently have to ask

08:29.208 --> 08:30.500
about every work of art now,

or what time period it was created.

Well, I think the real question is,
why are we still reading this book?

It's written by some rich white guy
about some rich white guy,

08:46.750 --> 08:49.125
and I guess we're supposed
to feel bad for him

08:49.208 --> 08:52.208
because he's obsessed
with the only girl he can't have?

08:52.291 --> 08:54.541

about the American dream,

08:54.625 --> 08:58.916

or the working class, or Black mothers,

but The Great Gatsby is a classic.

doesn't mean this is less good.

to put the eggs on top.

and dump them in there?

that Seth Acosta is nice to everyone?

12:49.541 --> 12:50.500
Seth the Shrimp?

12:50.583 --> 12:53.708
He's not a shrimp anymore.
He grew like a foot over the summer.

12:55.125 --> 12:55.958
Yeah.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.750
He's just, like… really friendly.

13:00.291 --> 13:02.333
[Claudia] Oh, my God.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.458
You want to bang Seth the Shrimp.

13:04.541 --> 13:07.416
-Sure hope my first time isn't banging.
-[Claudia gasps]

You want to have 15 of his babies.

13:11.041 --> 13:11.875
Whoa.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.750
You're right.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.166

a new nickname.

13:42.291 --> 13:43.291

13:47.500 --> 13:50.166
-[Lucy] No, thanks. I got it.
-[Mitchell] Oh, come on.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.416
I think we got off
on the wrong foot earlier.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.333
Don't touch me.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.250
No need to freak out.

13:57.041 --> 13:58.291
I'm not freaking out.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.708
I didn't say
that you could touch me. Okay?

14:46.291 --> 14:49.250

I don't feel safe.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.041
-Mitchell?
-Yes.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.083
-Wilson?
-Yeah.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.583
-Captain of the football team?
-Yes.

14:55.666 --> 14:57.166
He's bothering you.

14:57.250 --> 15:00.250
-He's harassing me.
-Oh. There's that word.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.458
If you use that word,
that means I have to do a bunch of stuff,

15:03.541 --> 15:06.916
but if he's bothering you,
and that's what it sounds like to me,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.416
then we can actually have a conversation.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Lucy, I am aware that outside these walls

15:14.083 --> 15:17.916
the world is experiencing a tornado,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.583
and that, in response,
young people, especially girls,

15:21.666 --> 15:25.333
are expressing their discontent
about everything in every direction.

15:25.416 --> 15:30.708
But we have to be clear about things
before we move forward.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.791
-Okay. I just--
-Look, look, look.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.500
I step in when we find drugs in school

15:36.583 --> 15:40.375
or when someone threatens
on YouTube to bring in a weapon.

15:40.458 --> 15:43.750
This feels like something
that we can solve together.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.416
It's your first week of school,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.166
in a new school. [chuckles]

15:49.250 --> 15:51.458
That can be emotional. Mm-hm.

15:52.166 --> 15:56.083
It says here on your transcript
that you play music.

15:56.625 --> 16:01.125
I think you would make
a great addition to the marching band.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.833
Think about it.

16:03.916 --> 16:06.541
All those cute little outfits

16:06.625 --> 16:11.291
and you can blow all those big emotions
into the saxophone

16:11.375 --> 16:12.958
or the piccolo.

16:13.041 --> 16:15.000
Whatever feels right to you.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.375
Gigi, let's sign her up
for the marching band.

16:43.666 --> 16:45.541

16:46.041 --> 16:47.291
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.875
Look, I just wanted
to say ignore Mitchell.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.291
Why should I have to ignore him?

16:55.083 --> 16:56.833
Why can't he just not be a dick?

16:58.291 --> 17:01.208
[laughs] He's an idiot.
He has been since the second grade.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.416
He's dangerous.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.416
I don't think he's dangerous.
I think he's just annoying.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.500
You know that annoying
can be more than just annoying, right?

17:11.208 --> 17:13.416
Like, it can be code for worse stuff.

17:13.958 --> 17:17.125
If you keep your head down,
he'll move on and bother somebody else.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.041
Thanks for the advice,

17:21.125 --> 17:23.458
but I'm gonna keep my head up, high.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.833
See you in class.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.916

17:31.000 --> 17:33.958
I let three people merge and not one wave.

17:34.041 --> 17:35.708
It's a heartless town we live in.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.208
[Vivian] Want some salad?

17:37.291 --> 17:38.125
[Lisa] No.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.750
Then why did we buy, like,
12 cucumbers at the farmers' market?

17:41.833 --> 17:44.750
[Lisa] Because.
We have to support the farmers.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.875
[Lisa sighs]

17:56.041 --> 17:57.708
Ah! Thank you.

17:58.541 --> 18:00.250
-Long day?
-Yeah.

18:00.333 --> 18:05.083
There were so many DUIs and UTIs,
I think I might have screwed some up.

18:05.916 --> 18:09.000
Hey, Mom, what do 16-year-olds care about?

18:09.083 --> 18:10.375
[Lisa] Oh, I don't know.

18:10.458 --> 18:13.958
When I was 16, all I cared about
was smashing the patriarchy

18:14.041 --> 18:15.458
and burning it all down.

18:16.041 --> 18:18.125

to keep my head up high.
