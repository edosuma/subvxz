[narrator] <i> 16 of the</i>
<i>best tattoo artists</i>

00:03.670 --> 00:05.880
<i>from all over the country</i>
<i>are battling it out</i>

00:05.964 --> 00:07.924
<i>to determine who's number one.</i>

00:08.007 --> 00:08.925
[shrieks]

00:09.008 --> 00:10.927
<i>On the last</i>
<i>episode of Ink Master,</i>

00:11.010 --> 00:14.013
<i>nine artists were left</i>
<i>in the competition.</i>

00:14.097 --> 00:15.890
What the [bleep] is this?

00:15.974 --> 00:19.769
<i>Star Wars Stormtroopers</i>
<i>invaded the Flash Challenge.</i>

00:19.853 --> 00:21.062
[bleep] Yes!

00:21.146 --> 00:22.647
Lord, have mercy.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.232
The nerd has appeared.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.316
[laughs]

00:25.400 --> 00:27.360
<i>Clint set his sights on Sarah.</i>

00:27.444 --> 00:28.445
Just take her down.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.779
If she drops the ball,
it's gonna put her here

00:29.863 --> 00:30.989
and that's gonna
put me here.

00:31.072 --> 00:31.948
You're gonna tell me
what you want,

00:32.031 --> 00:32.949
where you want it,
how you want it,

00:33.032 --> 00:33.783
and you're not
gonna change your mind.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.619
<i>In the elimination tattoo...</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:38.037
May the force be with you.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.707
<i>Super fans had</i>
<i>their love for Star Wars</i>

00:40.790 --> 00:43.042
permanently inked
on their skin.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.002
[whimpers]

00:44.085 --> 00:44.627
No crying in <i> Star Wars.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:47.005
If I'm here tomorrow...

00:47.088 --> 00:49.674
I'm shootin' at you!
I'm shootin' at you!

00:49.758 --> 00:51.384
I'm shootin' at everybody
at the top,

00:51.468 --> 00:52.010
'cause I'm gonna die anyway.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.887
<i>At the elimination,</i>

00:53.970 --> 00:56.514
<i>Mark and Kay Kutta</i>
<i>were the bottom two.</i>

00:56.598 --> 00:57.640
Mark.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.808
Those colors, man.
Those are no-nos.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.603
This competition doesn't
get easier as time goes on.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.104
I'm like rocky right here,
keep getting my ass whooped,

01:03.188 --> 01:05.607
but until the fight's over,
I'm in the game.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.900
Kay.
You're struggling.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.694
It doesn't have drapery feel.

01:09.778 --> 01:10.904
Looks like
he's wearing lunch meat.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.156
I'm not done fighting.
I'm 100% here.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.992
So I gotta say
[bleep] that [bleep].

01:16.075 --> 01:18.244
Kay, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.749
<i>Eight artists remain,</i>

01:22.832 --> 01:27.629
<i>but only one</i>
<i>will earn a $100,000 prize</i>

01:27.712 --> 01:30.507
<i>and the title of Ink Master.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:33.384
[rock music]

02:21.516 --> 02:25.353
[music]

02:31.442 --> 02:32.861
Back for another fight?

02:32.944 --> 02:34.028
Always, man.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.030
Which one of y'all
came out on top?

02:36.114 --> 02:37.115
She won.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.741
The best tattoo of the day
goes to Tatu Baby.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.202
{\an5}-For real?

02:38.825 --> 02:41.202
-For real.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.873
Tatu Baby, the tattoo you did
was outstanding.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.793
Are you glad that you lost
to a <i> Star Wars</i> virgin?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.587
Ppht! What?

02:50.670 --> 02:54.007
I did a [bleep] kick-ass piece.
I love everything I did in it.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.093
There wasn't anything
that I would change at all.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.888
{\an8}Deep down, I really feel like
I should've won this challenge.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.600
I think I had a bigger piece
that was more technically done.

03:03.683 --> 03:04.934
No, no, no.
Are you serious?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.562
The judges liked
all the contrast

03:07.645 --> 03:08.438
that I put into my Yoda.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.732
{\an5}-That's how I perceived it.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.732
-[sighs]

03:10.815 --> 03:12.233
{\an8}Sarah is a very big
know-it-all.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.153
Whatever Sarah says
is not gonna take away

03:15.236 --> 03:17.322
from the fact
that I won fair and square.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.492
[music]

03:29.834 --> 03:32.170
Good morning, artists.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.595
You're all one step
closer to $100,000,

03:40.678 --> 03:42.639
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

03:42.722 --> 03:44.057
and the title of Ink Master.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.142
We begin
with the Flash Challenge.

03:46.225 --> 03:49.729
This week,
we are testing gradation.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.316
"Gradation" is the
blend of dark to light color.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.986
The better tattoos
have completely seamless blends

03:57.070 --> 03:59.447
from one color to the other,
from black to light.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.991
For today's Flash Challenge,

04:02.075 --> 04:04.827
you will scratch a design
on a 7x7-foot

04:04.911 --> 04:07.288
custom-made ampersand
scratch-board.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.959
{\an8}Scratch-boards, you have
to scratch away the light source

04:11.042 --> 04:14.045
{\an8}and leave the dark areas.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.421
<i>It's pretty much</i>
<i>either black or white.</i>

04:15.505 --> 04:17.673
<i>Gradation is really difficult</i>
<i>to do on a scratch-board.</i>

04:17.757 --> 04:20.510
To intensify your work,
we'll be judging your board

04:20.593 --> 04:23.137
under a black light.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.306
<i>Once the black lights are on,</i>
<i>there's no way to hide</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:26.683
<i>any imperfection.</i>

04:26.766 --> 04:29.227
<i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>a real tough competition to win.</i>

04:29.310 --> 04:30.687
But that's not all.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.522
We're also testing
your adaptability.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.023
Today...

04:34.107 --> 04:36.275
You'll work in teams of two.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.322
{\an8}That's [bleep] up.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.657
I work well with others.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.659
{\an8}Let's hope to God it's somebody
that's as talented as I am.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.577
Tatu Baby,

04:46.661 --> 04:48.079
you won the best
tattoo of the day

04:48.162 --> 04:48.871
in the last
elimination tattoo.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.541
You now have the power

04:51.624 --> 04:54.877
to assign the teams
for this Flash Challenge.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.505
<i>I've won three,</i>
<i>and she's won one?</i>

04:57.588 --> 04:59.382
{\an8}And now she gets an advantage,
and I didn't get [bleep]?

04:59.465 --> 05:00.883
Assign the skulls.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.389
{\an8}I'm not gonna put
the strongest artists together

05:06.472 --> 05:09.183
because obviously, I still want
to win this Flash Challenge.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.519
Mark is like the cockroach
that won't die.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.563
He's definitely
nowhere near as level

05:13.646 --> 05:15.231
as many of us
that are here.

05:15.314 --> 05:16.274
Anybody that I put with Mark

05:16.357 --> 05:20.194
will feel like
I gave them a disadvantage.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.863
All right, guys.
One at a time,

05:21.946 --> 05:23.906
read the name
on the bottom of your skull,

05:23.990 --> 05:26.075
revealing your team
for this Flash Challenge.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.201
Jesse.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.163
Sebastian.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.915
{\an8}We can do some crazy [bleep].

05:32.999 --> 05:35.376
Sarah,
please reveal your skull.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.794
<i>I think Tatu Baby</i>

05:36.878 --> 05:37.837
{\an8}has a bit of jealousy
towards me.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.590
She's going to give me
the weakest link here.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.384
Mark.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.429
I knew it.
I'm [bleep].

05:46.512 --> 05:48.556
Clint and Jamie,
you're the final team.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.810
The winners
of this Flash Challenge

05:52.894 --> 05:55.521
will have the power to assign
all the human canvases

05:55.605 --> 05:58.024
in the elimination tattoo
together.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.068
You have four hours
to complete your design,

06:00.151 --> 06:02.695
and your time starts...

06:02.779 --> 06:05.156
Now.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.242
I'm left-handed.
You're right-handed?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.952
Holy [bleep].
That comes in handy.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.246
{\an8}This week,
we are testing two skills:

06:12.330 --> 06:14.123
Adaptability and gradation.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.833
We're gonna have them
work in teams

06:15.917 --> 06:18.419
to see how they adapt to
working with each other's style

06:18.503 --> 06:21.839
and show gradation through
the shading from dark to light.

06:21.923 --> 06:22.965
Do it.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.468
{\an8}I'm definitely
leading this team.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.553
What do you think?
Should I put a pupil?

06:27.637 --> 06:28.137
{\an5}-No.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.137
-No pupil.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.139
If we're gonna win this,

06:30.223 --> 06:31.516
he's definitely gonna
adapt to my style.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.228
{\an8}Clint and I end up
deciding on doing a skull.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.271
{\an8}I come up
with this fantastic idea

06:37.355 --> 06:39.816
{\an8}to put a really
hard light source

06:39.899 --> 06:41.275
on the corner
of the scratch-board.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.735
Light on the top
and working in?

06:42.819 --> 06:44.237
Yeah, if you
come down that way.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.490
Show a good, smooth
gradation from white to dark.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.574
All right.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.742
{\an8}I'm gonna work on the skull,

06:49.826 --> 06:51.077
and he's gonna work on
the light source.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.704
Pain in the ass, this is.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.999
See what I'm doing?

06:57.083 --> 06:58.459
Always pull backwards
like this.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.127
Oh, okay.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.503
<i>I get paired with Sarah.</i>

07:00.586 --> 07:02.171
{\an8}I feel a little
more comfortable for myself,

07:02.255 --> 07:04.382
because she's
a great artist.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.425
Win-win for Mark.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.553
Wanna start, like,
detailing stuff?

07:08.636 --> 07:11.055
{\an8}I'm kind of worried just because
he hasn't given me any input.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.016
Tatu Baby took care of
herself and screwed me.

07:14.100 --> 07:14.725
Two hours, guys.
Halfway point.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.812
[music]

07:24.485 --> 07:25.528
Oh, yeah,
I'm excited about this.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.615
{\an8}Me and Jesse are
adapting his style to my style

07:29.699 --> 07:31.450
by having our
own characters

07:31.534 --> 07:32.410
incorporated within each other.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.203
{\an8}It's gonna look good
no matter what, right?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.621
I'm going
for the clown girl.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.000
<i>Jesse's style is more like</i>
<i>googly-eye, cute cartoon.</i>

07:39.083 --> 07:41.085
It's gonna be awesome.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.299
I can see what you were doing,
and I can clean it.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.634
That thing works
really well, man.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.552
No [bleep].

07:49.635 --> 07:50.678
{\an8}We're showing adaptability
by the fact

07:50.761 --> 07:54.223
that I'll start an area
and we'll actually switch.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.977
You can't really tell
who did what.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.562
<i>We're gonna show gradation</i>
<i>by doing horns,</i>

07:59.645 --> 08:02.064
<i>and we have</i>
<i>a nice light source,</i>

08:02.148 --> 08:03.065
so you'll see it
be really bright

08:03.149 --> 08:05.443
<i>and then slowly, slowly</i>
<i>turn to black.</i>

08:05.526 --> 08:06.402
It's gonna look great.

08:06.485 --> 08:08.196
All right, guys.
One more hour.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.156
[rock music]

08:14.285 --> 08:15.578
I need to get
my back cracked.

08:15.661 --> 08:19.832
I got something wrong right
between my shoulder blades.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.084
{\an8}I'm not feeling any vibe
at all from Mark

08:22.168 --> 08:24.212
{\an8}where he's putting
any effort into this.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.631
He keeps making excuses.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.548
I'm so upset right now.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.968
It's just turning into
a [bleep] wreck.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.600
[bleep],
it's a Goddamn mess.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.227
<i>I'm looking at it, and it's like</i>
<i>a skull with some white.</i>

08:39.309 --> 08:41.187
{\an8}We need to add
something to this.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.731
{\an8}There's too
much open area.

08:43.813 --> 08:45.566
Uh-oh. Clint's going freestyle,
[bleep] It up.

08:49.153 --> 08:53.032
Ten, nine,
eight, seven,

08:53.115 --> 08:55.952
six, five, four,

08:56.035 --> 08:58.704
three, two, one.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.915
That is it.
No more scratching.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.292
Badass, man.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.127
<i>One of the elements</i>
<i>of the scratch-board</i>

09:05.211 --> 09:07.421
{\an8}is that the undercoating
is black light reflective.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.339
<i>Once you turn</i>
<i>the black light on,</i>

09:08.422 --> 09:11.217
every little scratch
is gonna glow

09:11.300 --> 09:12.843
<i>and come to light</i>
<i>and be more visible.</i>

09:12.927 --> 09:15.137
[sighs]

09:15.221 --> 09:16.097
Sebastian and Steve.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.516
Okay, hit the lights.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.937
{\an5}-Whoa, that looks bad.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.937
-Ooh, yeah.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.438
It looks
pretty [bleep] sick.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.817
Who did what
in this particular piece?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.694
He started on one side,
I started on the other side,

09:29.777 --> 09:30.820
then we swapped.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.321
Nice use
of adaptability there.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.073
Very good use
of gradients.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.491
They show the darks
and the lights.

09:35.574 --> 09:38.077
Great examples of gradation
in the horns and in the brow.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.287
Certainly in the teeth.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.872
Lots of dimension,
lots of depth.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.126
{\an5}-Thank you.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.126
-Mark and Sarah.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.460
The whole thing
looks like maybe y'all

09:46.544 --> 09:48.421
didn't work well
together as a team,

09:48.504 --> 09:50.673
you didn't have a good strategy
from the start,

09:50.756 --> 09:52.008
and you left it unfinished.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.176
Two little tentacles
over here to the right.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.887
Looks like you spent a lot
of time detailing those out.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.264
You don't have
a lot of gradients

09:58.347 --> 09:59.765
from light to dark, though.

09:59.849 --> 10:00.891
The face is very overworked.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.436
I don't really like
the drawing, and I definitely

10:03.519 --> 10:05.396
don't see the shading
that we're looking for.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.025
Baby and Jesse.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.862
It's a real nice blend
of both your styles.

10:12.945 --> 10:13.946
It seems like you guys

10:14.030 --> 10:15.531
had good teamwork
and a good concept.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.450
I love the hair,
I love the Rose.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.494
Really nice uses of really
light scratching in there

10:20.578 --> 10:22.788
especially in your little guy,
Jesse, in the tongue.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.415
Eyeballs on him are great.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.750
Really stand out more
once the black light came on.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.712
Jamie, Clint.

10:29.795 --> 10:33.299
We just both took our spots
and started scratching away.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.800
You guys didn't work
very much as a team,

10:34.884 --> 10:35.885
so it's not like--

10:35.968 --> 10:38.554
Clint, you bounced here
and he bounced there.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.348
I don't know if you needed
to do that much white.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.724
You could've probably got
the effect with half of it.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.894
The last-minute addition
of the candles is a bummer.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.272
They don't go with the light
source, so it's kind of weird.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.025
{\an8}I, for the record,
did not okay the candles.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.151
Clint shot us in the foot.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.404
{\an5}-Alright, let's talk about this.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.404
-Let's get into this.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.407
Sebastian and Steve up first.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.159
They definitely
showed gradation.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.661
I think they just went a little
heavy on the scratching.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.580
But overall,
I like how they worked together.

11:04.663 --> 11:06.540
It's not a separate,
"you did this, I did this."

11:06.624 --> 11:07.583
Really came out cool.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.293
Tatu Baby and Jesse.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.795
Their styles
came together well.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.673
I think Jesse's gradation
is definitely the smoothest.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.217
From a distance, it just
looks really smooth and soft.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.010
That's what we're looking for--
light to dark.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.304
{\an5}-Sarah and Mark.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.304
-Theirs sucked.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.680
When I was giving
my critique about it,

11:21.764 --> 11:22.890
I couldn't say
anything positive.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.225
The layout's bad,
the design's bad,

11:24.308 --> 11:24.892
there's no gradation.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.102
That was a tough one, man.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.603
Jamie and Clint.

11:27.686 --> 11:28.646
I think what Jamie did
was really good,

11:28.729 --> 11:31.440
and his skull would've
looked just as cool

11:31.524 --> 11:33.234
without the weak stuff
Clint put around it.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.610
But they were the only guys
that maximized the whole board.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.946
It's a strong design
from a distance.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.240
I think it's time
to let these guys know who won.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.493
In this Flash Challenge,

11:42.576 --> 11:45.413
we were testing gradation
and your adaptability

11:45.496 --> 11:48.124
by making you work
in teams.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.875
Sarah and Mark, looking
at everybody else's work,

11:49.959 --> 11:53.671
you guys obviously had
the poorest one in here today.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.175
When there's
this few pieces to look at,

11:58.259 --> 11:59.885
what's good is good
and it shines,

11:59.969 --> 12:01.971
and what's bad sticks out.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.514
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>that I've gotten</i>

12:03.597 --> 12:06.976
{\an8}such a harsh critique and
been in the bottom in anything.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.477
<i>Mark just pulled me down.</i>

12:08.561 --> 12:10.604
The judges have
come to a decision.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.608
The winner
of the Flash Challenge is...

12:18.154 --> 12:19.321
Jesse and Tatu Baby.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.158
[applause]

12:22.241 --> 12:23.659
My partner.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.203
<i>That's bull[bleep].</i>

12:26.287 --> 12:27.830
{\an8}Sebastian and I
should've won this.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.165
You two now have the power

12:29.248 --> 12:33.002
to assign all the human canvases
as a team.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.546
Head back to the loft and get
ready to meet your canvases

12:35.629 --> 12:37.798
for the next
elimination tattoo.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.555
{\an8}You are not to the level
of a lot of people here.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.807
{\an8}So you shouldn't be
speaking about anything.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.851
You'll also
be tattooing as a team.

12:48.934 --> 12:49.768
That's [bleep] up.

12:50.102 --> 12:54.273
[music]

12:57.359 --> 12:58.527
Before I get up
in front of everybody,

12:58.611 --> 12:59.695
handing out skulls,

12:59.778 --> 13:01.697
if you can tell me that you're
gonna play a clean game,

13:01.780 --> 13:02.823
then I'm willing
to meet you halfway,

13:02.907 --> 13:06.368
but if you're not, then I'll
throw you under the bus.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.330
"If you do me good,
then I'll do you good."

13:09.413 --> 13:10.831
<i>That's all just hot air.</i>

13:10.915 --> 13:12.082
Jesse's gonna look out
for Jesse.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.459
I don't want
to [bleep] people over.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.418
If I win the next
Flash Challenge,

13:14.502 --> 13:16.879
I'm gonna try
to Bury you under the bus.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.673
<i>I have no intention</i>
<i>of making deals with Jesse.</i>

13:19.757 --> 13:22.134
I don't care
what tattoo he gives me.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.135
It doesn't make
a [bleep] difference.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.595
Obviously,

13:24.678 --> 13:25.930
if you outright tell me
that you're gunning for me,

13:26.013 --> 13:28.057
then it only makes sense
for me to protect myself.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.558
So if you know
I'm gonna [bleep] you,

13:29.642 --> 13:31.352
{\an5}-you would [bleep] me.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.352
-Of course.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.729
The way I see it, you guys
won the Flash Challenge,

13:33.812 --> 13:35.856
you should do what you two
think is best for yourselves.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.526
Hey, man, if you [bleep] me,
in the long run,

13:38.609 --> 13:40.236
it's gonna make you look
like an ass[bleep], not me.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.153
<i>I'm here to beat Jesse.</i>

13:41.237 --> 13:44.406
{\an8}I'm not on Jesse's team.
I'm on my team.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.492
So I'll have no problem
taking him out.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.495
[music]

13:59.463 --> 14:00.589
Welcome to this week's
elimination tattoo.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.758
Kill it,
and you're one step closer

14:02.841 --> 14:06.095
to 100 grand
and the title of Ink Master.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.681
You'll be judged by Oliver peck,
Chris Nunez, and myself.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.683
Also remember,
America is voting.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.310
Viewers at home
will vote for the tattoo

14:13.394 --> 14:14.812
that they think is best

14:14.895 --> 14:17.523
using the same criteria
that the judges use.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.067
This week we have
a very special guest judge.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.152
{\an5}-[groans]

14:20.150 --> 14:22.152
-[bleep].

14:22.236 --> 14:24.613
He's been tattooing
for over 30 years,

14:24.697 --> 14:27.366
and is a pioneer
of black-and-gray.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.576
Freddy Negrete.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.995
[applause]

14:31.078 --> 14:32.496
Oh, [bleep].

14:32.580 --> 14:34.081
{\an8}Freddy Negrete coming out
is the [bleep].

14:34.164 --> 14:37.167
<i>I was a part of a group</i>
<i>of tattoo artists</i>

14:37.251 --> 14:40.296
{\an8}that introduced
the black-and-gray style.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.880
Prison-style tattooing
is where it all came from.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.842
When I was in prison,
the agreement was

14:44.925 --> 14:46.844
as long as you don't
kill each other,

14:46.927 --> 14:47.970
we'll let you tattoo.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.346
It's an honor
to have you here.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.682
I cannot define the happiness
in my heart right now.

14:51.765 --> 14:52.474
{\an5}-Thank you so much

14:51.765 --> 14:52.474
-It's good to be here.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.559
for joining us.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.561
This week,
we're testing gradation.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.438
You'll be tattooing
in a style

14:57.521 --> 15:00.065
known as one of the oldest
forms of tattooing.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.442
Black-and-Gray.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.694
Oh, [bleep].

15:04.737 --> 15:05.988
{\an8}This is what
I love to do.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.408
I am taking this challenge,
and I can't be stopped.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.702
In the Flash Challenge,

15:11.785 --> 15:13.662
we tested your adaptability
by making you work as a team.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.873
In the elimination tattoo,

15:15.956 --> 15:17.124
you'll also
be tattooing as a team.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.836
{\an5}-[whistles]

15:19.335 --> 15:20.836
-[bleep].

15:20.919 --> 15:23.589
For this elimination tattoo,
you'll have five hours

15:23.672 --> 15:25.841
to tattoo
a good and evil design.

15:25.924 --> 15:29.803
One artist must tattoo good,
and one artist must tattoo evil

15:29.887 --> 15:33.432
on the same canvas,
at the same time.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.853
{\an5}-[laughs]

15:34.141 --> 15:37.853
-Oh, [bleep].

15:37.936 --> 15:40.564
{\an8}Two people working on
the same person simultaneously?

15:40.648 --> 15:41.649
That's waiting
for a [bleep]-up.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.108
Let's meet your canvases.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.698
{\an5}-Oh, [bleep].

15:46.737 --> 15:49.698
-A priest?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.700
{\an8}Holy [bleep],
there's a [bleep] priest.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.370
<i>This is awesome.</i>

15:54.453 --> 15:56.538
{\an8}The king of darkness
might be tattooing a priest.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.249
Tatu Baby and Jesse,

15:59.333 --> 16:01.001
because you won
the Flash Challenge,

16:01.085 --> 16:03.087
together,
you now have the power

16:03.170 --> 16:05.756
to assign
all the human canvases.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.466
<i>Baby gets to pick</i>
<i>the teams again.</i>

16:07.549 --> 16:09.885
{\an8}I know she's going to be
gunning for me.

16:09.968 --> 16:12.888
Use your power for good
or for evil.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.973
The choice is up to you.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.726
{\an8}Mark is obviously
the weakest link in the house.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.770
<i>He has to go home.</i>

16:19.853 --> 16:21.230
{\an8}I've been waiting
for black-and-gray.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.315
I've been waiting
for a challenge to pop up

16:23.399 --> 16:24.566
that I know
I'm pretty decent at.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.318
When you look at
the talent pool that's here,

16:26.402 --> 16:27.277
and what I've shown
up until this point,

16:27.361 --> 16:29.947
I believe everyone
is expecting me to fail,

16:30.030 --> 16:30.989
but I'm definitely
trying to throw

16:31.073 --> 16:32.574
a monkey wrench
in somebody's program.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.409
So, what are you
trying to get?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.993
A tattoo of a priest
on one calf,

16:35.077 --> 16:36.745
and on the other calf,
a drug addict.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.039
{\an8}Come on, who wouldn't
want to tattoo a priest?

16:39.123 --> 16:40.457
I want that priest.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.750
I just want sugar skulls
across the chest.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.920
Are you willing
to change locations?

16:45.003 --> 16:46.922
I'm looking to get
the archangel of Michael

16:47.005 --> 16:49.550
and the fallen angel
of Lucifer.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.592
I'm looking to get
the patron Saint of firefighters

16:50.676 --> 16:52.761
and a burning devil.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.805
{\an8}Tatu Baby and I are
in a powerful position here.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.932
<i>Sebastian is still</i>
<i>kind of putting up friction,</i>

16:57.015 --> 16:58.016
<i>which just seems</i>
<i>really stupid.</i>

16:58.100 --> 17:01.061
I might end up
giving him a bad canvas.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.063
{\an8}Jesse can't intimidate me.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.108
Even if he tried to intimidate
me, it wouldn't work.

17:06.191 --> 17:06.942
Canvases...

17:07.025 --> 17:08.152
One by one,

17:08.234 --> 17:10.028
please reveal the name
on the bottom of your skulls.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.363
Steve. Jamie.

17:11.446 --> 17:14.532
<i>I do black-and-gray well,</i>
<i>Steve does black-and-gray well.</i>

17:14.616 --> 17:16.827
{\an8}I think that we're gonna
shine on this one for sure.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.454
Jesse. Tatu Baby.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.290
Mark. Sebastian.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.917
<i>I came in here expecting to get</i>
<i>thrown the hardest tattoo.</i>

17:25.002 --> 17:27.838
{\an8}So you can think
that you're [bleep] me over,

17:27.921 --> 17:30.674
but I'm still expecting
to smash everybody.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.177
Sarah. Clint.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.638
{\an8}I've never done a collabo tattoo
before in my life.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.640
And Clint
is always difficult.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.642
I'm gonna be screwed.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.562
You have
the rest of the evening

17:43.645 --> 17:45.481
to consult
with your human canvas.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.441
Tomorrow,
you'll have five hours

17:47.524 --> 17:49.985
to complete your
black-and-gray tattoos.

17:50.068 --> 17:53.238
Based on your work,
one of you will be closing shop.

17:54.072 --> 17:54.281
Good luck.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.201
There's two
different ways

17:57.284 --> 17:58.577
{\an8}that a collabo
works really great.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.329
<i>One is you can't tell</i>
<i>who's done what.</i>

18:00.412 --> 18:03.999
<i>The other is two different</i>
<i>styles fusing into one.</i>

18:04.082 --> 18:06.627
Hopefully the artists
work well together.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.670
So, the reason
I asked you if we should--

18:08.754 --> 18:11.048
if we could move it is simply
because doing a collaboration,

18:11.131 --> 18:12.174
if I'm stretching this way,

18:12.257 --> 18:13.425
{\an5}-and she's stretching this way,

18:12.257 --> 18:13.425
-Right.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.176
It could compromise
the integrity of the tattoo.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.178
{\an8}On a collaboration
like this,

18:16.261 --> 18:19.389
having two artists
tattooing real closely together

18:19.473 --> 18:20.265
is not the
ideal situation.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.519
{\an5}-Would you do your arm?

18:20.349 --> 18:23.519
-I could.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.062
Be perfect.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.480
You work all the way
on your side,

18:26.563 --> 18:27.564
and I work
all the way on my side.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.067
You want to try to get 'em
as far apart as possible

18:30.150 --> 18:31.902
so you're not interfering
with the other artist.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.862
Could she connect 'em
like this?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.781
{\an5}-Would that work?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.781
-Oh, yes.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.199
{\an8}Jesse thinks
of this great idea.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.659
We're gonna make sure
that they connect.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.954
If she closes her arm,
it's gonna look like one piece.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.413
I think
that'd be awesome.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.290
This idea is a huge risk.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.709
There is no in-between.
Either we knock it out,

18:47.793 --> 18:49.294
or we drop the ball.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.547
{\an5}-Yes.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.547
-That'd be great.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.882
The patron Saint of
firefighters is Saint Florian.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.801
{\an5}-Okay.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.801
-So what I'd like to see

18:55.884 --> 18:58.053
is a burning devil
coming up out of the bottom,

18:58.136 --> 19:00.931
and Saint Florian
pushing him back down.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.225
<i>The client wants</i>
<i>this one image,</i>

19:03.308 --> 19:06.687
{\an8}and we have to get this
done between the two of us.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.939
It's tricky.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.567
It's like two people writing on
one piece of notebook paper.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.526
{\an8}I don't think
I'm at a disadvantage

19:12.609 --> 19:14.736
{\an8}by doing one tattoo
with another person.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.406
{\an8}I [bleep] know
I'm at a disadvantage.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.533
In essence, we're both gonna
have to start like this.

19:19.616 --> 19:22.035
<i>Somebody's gonna have</i>
<i>to work upside-down.</i>

19:22.119 --> 19:24.246
<i>This is gonna be a hard tattoo</i>
<i>to even complete,</i>

19:24.329 --> 19:25.372
<i>let alone pull off.</i>

19:25.455 --> 19:26.915
If we don't produce this tattoo,
then we go home.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.418
I've done collabos
with people.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.211
It doesn't always
happen so well.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.009
[music]

19:38.635 --> 19:40.178
Okay, face down.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.265
I'm more concerned about

19:43.348 --> 19:45.517
how we're gonna go about
putting this tattoo on him.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.935
[groans]

19:47.019 --> 19:48.395
Me working on the bottom
and Sarah being at the top--

19:48.478 --> 19:50.272
I don't know, we're gonna
have to figure this out.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.441
{\an5}-Do it like this...

19:50.355 --> 19:52.441
-Mm-hmm.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.901
And then I can
almost do the same thing.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.693
Mm-hmm.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.111
The main thing
is trying to stay

19:56.194 --> 19:57.487
away from each other
as much as possible.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.072
Okay.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.617
Tattooing in the same area
as another artist

20:01.700 --> 20:03.035
has a lot of risk.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.953
You can get poked
by the other person's needle,

20:05.037 --> 20:06.955
the machines can
bump into each other.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.541
There's a lot of danger
that's associated with it.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.500
{\an5}-This'll be my section.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.500
-And this'll be me.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.711
Okay.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.379
<i>I've been worried</i>
<i>about time before,</i>

20:14.463 --> 20:15.756
but this is...

20:16.590 --> 20:17.299
This is bad.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.091
All right, buddy.
Y'all got it?

20:18.175 --> 20:19.927
All right, cool.
Yeah, thanks.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.845
No problem.

20:21.929 --> 20:25.098
Today you must create
a good and evil tattoo

20:25.182 --> 20:26.308
in black-and-gray.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.686
You have five hours
to tattoo your shared canvas,

20:29.770 --> 20:32.940
and your time starts now.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.441
Let's go.

20:34.524 --> 20:35.442
All right.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.028
{\an8}Everybody has to do
a black-and-gray tattoo.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.529
We want to see
nice gradation,

20:39.613 --> 20:41.573
the best simple way
to show dark to light.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.200
And when we say
"black-and-gray,"

20:43.283 --> 20:45.369
it's really just
different tones of black ink.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.707
If it gets too uncomfortable,
I'll just go like this.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.254
All right. I'm yours.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.175
[needle buzzes]

21:00.259 --> 21:02.469
[music]

21:10.602 --> 21:12.229
{\an5}-That's good, right?

21:10.602 --> 21:12.229
-Yeah.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.480
<i>We're behind the pack.</i>

21:13.563 --> 21:14.022
{\an8}I'm kind of sweating it
at this point.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.857
It's not gonna work.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.902
See, the nose
is way over there.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.362
We need that nose
to be over here.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.363
{\an8}The only thing
that I'm shaky about

21:21.446 --> 21:25.450
<i>is our design,</i>
<i>making it look like one.</i>

21:25.534 --> 21:27.995
<i>This is a very crucial</i>
<i>part of this tattoo.</i>

21:28.078 --> 21:30.038
I mean, we have to make sure
that these line up perfectly.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.249
If they don't,
the piece won't work.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.250
I'm nervous.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.836
We designed this
to do this in five hours,

21:35.919 --> 21:38.046
<i>and now putting</i>
<i>our stencils on</i>

21:38.130 --> 21:40.674
is taking a good chunk
of our tattoo time.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.468
Let's do it.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.554
[dramatic music]

21:46.471 --> 21:48.265
{\an5}-You ready?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.265
-I'm ready.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.267
[needles buzzing]

21:53.812 --> 21:54.521
Four hours left, everybody.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.153
[groans]

22:01.236 --> 22:03.363
[bleep], man, your Mohawk's
gonna get in the way.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.825
{\an8}I'm more conscious of
Sarah than Sarah is of me.

22:06.908 --> 22:08.744
Sarah is in a game day mode,

22:08.827 --> 22:09.911
like, she's like,
"Go, go, go, go, go."

22:09.995 --> 22:14.332
The way she tattoos, she's
really, like, just into it.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.917
She's wiping, and she's, like,
all over the place.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.336
I can't throw in lines.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.340
We are so [bleep].

22:23.842 --> 22:25.343
[music]

22:28.805 --> 22:30.474
{\an8}It's honestly a lot easier

22:30.557 --> 22:32.392
{\an8}that he's getting
two separate areas done,

22:32.476 --> 22:34.686
<i>'cause there's not</i>
<i>too much pull and tug.</i>

22:34.770 --> 22:36.855
<i>We're on two completely</i>
<i>different areas.</i>

22:36.938 --> 22:38.774
I usually perform better
under pressure.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.692
That's, like, been
the story of my life.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.360
{\an8}Today is all about
validation for me.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.404
I believe everyone
is expecting me to fail.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.239
But I'm just focusing on me

22:46.323 --> 22:47.074
and getting this tattoo done
to the best of my abilities.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.367
I'm gonna piss somebody off.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.869
Somebody else is going home.

22:50.952 --> 22:51.453
[laughs]

22:52.829 --> 22:54.623
[whimpering]

22:56.249 --> 22:57.793
[grunts]

22:57.876 --> 23:00.545
[dramatic music]

23:04.382 --> 23:06.051
{\an8}I have never tattooed
a priest before.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.219
This is my first one.

23:07.302 --> 23:07.969
The priest is sitting
like a rock.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.554
This guy is not moving.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.768
How'd you guys decide
who took what?

23:14.851 --> 23:16.645
We thought that was
self-explanatory.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.313
{\an5}-Yeah.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.313
-Steve's the master of evil.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.148
In this design,
I'm showing gradation

23:20.232 --> 23:21.525
by a lot of smooth
black-and-grays.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.151
<i>There's a brick wall</i>
<i>that has smooth shading,</i>

23:23.235 --> 23:25.779
<i>the large areas of her arm</i>

23:25.862 --> 23:26.988
<i>have really smooth</i>
<i>dark-to-light shading.</i>

23:27.072 --> 23:28.824
It's a home run.

23:29.407 --> 23:30.158
How you looking, bro?

23:30.242 --> 23:33.078
I'll probably
be just on time.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.288
I'm not gonna have a lot
of spare time on this one.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.583
{\an8}I definitely have twice the
outline that Steve has to do.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.461
<i>Steve is way</i>
<i>ahead of me on his.</i>

23:41.545 --> 23:42.504
I am hauling ass.

23:45.298 --> 23:48.927
Could use
some advice over here.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.721
I'm just going like this.
Is that right?

23:51.805 --> 23:53.348
You want to come watch me
a second? How I do it?

23:53.431 --> 23:55.100
I'm not strong
in black-and-gray.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.519
Pretty much
just go like that.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.397
And then as I get tighter,
then I do tighter circles.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.524
{\an5}-Circles. Okay, cool. Thanks.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.524
-Yeah.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.152
I realize that I am
a lot stronger in new school

24:05.235 --> 24:06.444
than the other styles.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.531
I really should've practiced a
little more before I came here.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.159
He's tattooing black-and-gray
just like he's doing color.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.369
If you look at her tattoo,
she's blending it out.

24:14.452 --> 24:15.620
Hers looks really good.
Hers looks right.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.291
Two more hours.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.461
{\an5}-[exhales]

24:21.585 --> 24:23.461
-What?

24:23.545 --> 24:24.880
{\an5}-It's rough over there.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.880
-Is it?

24:24.963 --> 24:25.714
A lot of stretching
back and forth

24:25.797 --> 24:27.424
and getting
in each other's way?

24:27.507 --> 24:29.342
{\an5}-Well, I'm--I'm real--I dab.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.342
-Mm-hmm.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.721
And Sarah just...
Oh, [bleep], man.

24:32.804 --> 24:33.972
<i>Sarah is really just</i>

24:34.055 --> 24:36.057
beating that damn tattoo
like a stepchild or something.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.225
It's like, [bleep].

24:37.309 --> 24:38.643
<i>I don't look like it,</i>
<i>but I'm a delicate guy.</i>

24:38.727 --> 24:42.439
I like to pet the kitty,
y'know, I don't like to grab it

24:42.522 --> 24:44.065
and strangle it and [bleep]
like she does, you know?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.692
I'm like, [bleep].

24:45.775 --> 24:47.485
Let me know when you're done,
I'll flip him on my side,

24:47.569 --> 24:49.112
and I'll use
the last two minutes

24:49.196 --> 24:50.655
to clean up any line work.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.490
{\an8}I'm pulling
more than my own weight.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.160
I have the majority
of this tattoo to do.

24:55.243 --> 24:57.829
We cannot turn in
an unfinished tattoo.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.623
20 minutes remaining, guys.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.333
[needles buzzing]

25:01.416 --> 25:02.500
[music]

25:05.629 --> 25:06.713
Holy [bleep].

25:06.796 --> 25:09.716
I seriously am starting
to question if I'm gonna finish.

25:09.799 --> 25:14.387
Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six,

25:14.471 --> 25:16.431
five, four,

25:16.514 --> 25:19.768
three, two, one.

25:19.851 --> 25:20.977
That's it.

25:21.061 --> 25:21.895
Time's up. Machines down.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.231
No more ink.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.650
Whew. Thanks for
hanging in there at the end.

25:27.984 --> 25:28.735
No problem, brother.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.820
{\an5}-Oh, wow!

25:28.818 --> 25:30.820
-That's so cool.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.572
Perfect symmetry.
You guys did it.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.698
Let's take a look.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.076
I had the hardest [bleep]
tattoo in the room.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.911
Is it better than you expected?
Worse?

25:37.994 --> 25:39.579
{\an5}-What do you think?

25:37.994 --> 25:39.579
-It's a good tattoo.

25:39.663 --> 25:40.789
<i>Everybody else in the room,</i>

25:40.872 --> 25:42.582
yeah, they had to tattoo
with somebody,

25:42.666 --> 25:44.584
but they don't
have to compensate

25:44.668 --> 25:46.628
with that person
being in their way.

25:46.711 --> 25:47.879
I don't think there would've
been too many other people here

25:47.963 --> 25:50.298
paired up that could've done
this tattoo as well as we did.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.550
<i>Looking at our tattoo,</i>

25:52.634 --> 25:55.762
I think that Clint's
being a little overconfident.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.264
I'm very nervous.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.309
{\an8}Baby and Jesse
got their diapers changed,

26:01.393 --> 26:02.769
{\an8}and me and her
went down there,

26:02.852 --> 26:04.854
{\an8}and we got beat
like [bleep] stepchildren.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.147
You didn't knock it
out of the park.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.524
I'm not trying to--
I'm not trying to pick a fight.

26:07.607 --> 26:08.733
We can make this
a bloodbath,

26:08.817 --> 26:10.277
or you can understand
what I'm saying.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.822
[music]

26:15.573 --> 26:16.366
I feel brand-new today.

26:16.449 --> 26:19.411
I'm happy
with the tattoo I did.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.663
{\an5}-I'm ready to shine.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.663
-You did a good tattoo, man.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.331
If we're playing hangman,
he's only got

26:23.415 --> 26:25.834
one little limb left
before he's hung.

26:25.917 --> 26:26.501
Okay.
That's your opinion.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.628
<i>I think Mark has been</i>

26:28.712 --> 26:30.213
<i>one of the weaker performers</i>
<i>so far in this competition.</i>

26:30.297 --> 26:33.008
<i>And even with a good tattoo,</i>

26:33.091 --> 26:34.509
he's still gonna
get flicked off the edge.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.678
Man, I feel like dust.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.221
'Cause no matter
how hard you try

26:38.305 --> 26:40.098
to get dust
off the chopping board,

26:40.181 --> 26:43.893
when you blow that [bleep] off,
it just settles and comes back.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.688
Once you brush dust off,
it's on the floor.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.149
A different dust
is gonna come on top of you.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.317
But it never goes away.

26:50.400 --> 26:54.321
Mark, you are not to the level
of a lot of people here,

26:54.404 --> 26:55.739
so you shouldn't
be speaking about anything.

26:57.615 --> 26:58.199
[bleep] Just got real.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.201
You know what, man?

27:00.285 --> 27:01.995
I talk what I talk.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.913
You need to stop talking
and start walking.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.832
[music]

27:21.723 --> 27:23.350
This week,
we asked you to create

27:23.433 --> 27:25.352
a black-and-gray
good and evil tattoo.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.353
We were testing
your gradation.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.563
You worked as a team,

27:28.646 --> 27:30.690
but you will be judged
individually.

27:31.649 --> 27:34.402
Jamie and Steve,
you guys are up first.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.199
What was it like
getting the priest?

27:39.282 --> 27:40.742
Have either of you
tattooed a priest before?

27:40.825 --> 27:42.702
Can't say for sure
that I have, no.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.037
No, definitely not.

27:44.120 --> 27:48.041
You guys as a collabo really
captured a very intense story

27:48.124 --> 27:50.043
{\an8}and an intense
client's emotion,

27:50.126 --> 27:51.378
{\an8}and for doing that,
I commend you.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.630
Steve.
This is one ugly bitch.

27:53.713 --> 27:58.051
She's scary.
Super harsh, gritty image.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.719
He said zombie possessed.

27:59.803 --> 28:00.845
I think it is awesome.

28:00.929 --> 28:05.016
Your use of heavy darks
and a lot of light gradation

28:05.100 --> 28:07.102
in the syringe
and the cracks in the skin

28:07.185 --> 28:08.978
really let
this tattoo sink in.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.856
These details really come
at you, it's really impressive.

28:12.899 --> 28:13.733
Jamie.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.736
You got so many
little details in there

28:16.820 --> 28:18.238
that take so long to do.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.739
You pulled off a great tattoo

28:19.823 --> 28:21.074
in the amount of time
that you had.

28:21.157 --> 28:23.493
However, if you can
get the eyes that black,

28:23.576 --> 28:25.412
why not the Bible,
and why not the cross?

28:25.495 --> 28:26.704
It was definitely
a time issue.

28:26.788 --> 28:27.747
I didn't have time
to come back and actually

28:27.831 --> 28:29.749
do my black shading
through the whole thing.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.752
There's a lot of the same tone
going on in here.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.213
It's come to the point
where it's nitpicky.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.048
This is where you're gonna
get killed in this thing.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.595
Tatu Baby and Jesse.

28:44.848 --> 28:45.974
Tell me about this design.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.892
{\an8}It took us 37 minutes
alone to put on the stencil,

28:47.976 --> 28:51.020
{\an8}due to the fact that we
wanted the whole look to match.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.440
I have to compliment you
both on the collaboration.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.692
{\an8}It was an excellent
team effort.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.027
{\an8}It was really cool the way
she put her arms together.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.280
Tatu Baby.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.157
Baby, this is a very good
tattoo coming from you.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.825
{\an8}You weren't afraid to go in
there and put heavy blacks in.

29:03.908 --> 29:07.078
Underneath her chin
and in the dips of her eyes,

29:07.162 --> 29:09.706
you really got a lot of good,
solid, heavy black in there.

29:09.789 --> 29:11.791
But then there's also
really soft light gray,

29:11.875 --> 29:13.751
just give this thing a
wide-varying range of gradation.

29:13.835 --> 29:17.714
{\an8}You have no fear in putting
black where black goes.

29:17.797 --> 29:20.091
And once again, you're giving
the boys a run for their money.

29:21.134 --> 29:21.926
You've really, really come on

29:22.010 --> 29:24.053
towards the end
of this competition.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.515
Jesse.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.976
The thing
that I wish that

29:30.059 --> 29:31.686
you had done different
about this tattoo

29:31.769 --> 29:35.023
is the blacks aren't really
super saturated and solid.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.151
Where it went all the way to
black, you didn't maximize that.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.527
I was definitely nervous.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.279
I did a lot of research
over the past couple weeks.

29:41.362 --> 29:42.280
I've been really
trying to pump up

29:42.363 --> 29:44.491
my black-and-gray game
as much as possible.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.826
I agree with Oliver on some
of the saturation issues,

29:46.910 --> 29:49.412
but what I like
is that you did go in

29:49.496 --> 29:51.664
and do dark tones
and light tones.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.875
You didn't do a monochromatic,
gray piece.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.669
After the pinup girl, man,
that black-and-gray

29:56.753 --> 29:58.213
compared to this
black-and-gray,

29:58.296 --> 29:59.464
this is a huge improvement.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.760
Mark and Sebastian.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.224
{\an8}So, you guys kind of lucked out
getting the forearms there, huh?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.768
Yeah, it seemed like we were
just kind of working on our own.

30:12.143 --> 30:12.852
Sebastian.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.396
Man, this tattoo
is super smooth.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.898
Very nice gradations.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.902
The structure of this tattoo
really comes to life.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.029
These light, soft,
smooth areas in here

30:23.112 --> 30:26.449
really make the depths
of the black really strong.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.576
I'm a little bit
of a stickler for backgrounds.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.994
They complete a tattoo.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.704
And the flames on this thing
are a little wimpy.

30:31.788 --> 30:34.207
Knowing how to get
your backgrounds,

30:34.290 --> 30:36.584
knowing how to create a little
bit of a rhythm and a flow

30:36.668 --> 30:38.461
really completes
designs nicely.

30:39.546 --> 30:40.421
Mark.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.173
Well, you really
worried me with the shield

30:42.257 --> 30:43.383
when I first saw it.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.926
I thought it was
gonna look flat,

30:45.009 --> 30:47.428
but you did a really good job
with that light gray in there,

30:47.512 --> 30:48.304
making that cross
look beveled,

30:48.388 --> 30:50.014
giving that edge
around that shield,

30:50.098 --> 30:51.516
and making that shield lighter

30:51.599 --> 30:53.226
so it does stand apart
from that chest.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.144
There's very nice gradients
in this tattoo.

30:55.853 --> 30:56.896
You have
the easiest tattoo.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.774
You don't have a face,
you don't have hands.

30:59.857 --> 31:01.317
You had a pretty minimal
amount of things

31:01.401 --> 31:03.736
that you needed to hit.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.905
I think you're killing yourself
by doing these mini tats.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.199
I made actually
three pattern sizes.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.118
Every time I've gone
with the bigger one,

31:10.201 --> 31:13.246
I shot myself in the foot by not
getting able to finish it

31:13.329 --> 31:14.539
the way I wanted.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.499
This time, it was just me trying
to find my middle ground,

31:16.583 --> 31:17.959
and I went
with the smaller size.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.335
You're stifled right now.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.170
You're not in your comfort zone,
you're not flowing

31:21.254 --> 31:23.006
into the next round
with a bop.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.841
You're coming in
standing back a little bit,

31:24.924 --> 31:25.800
you're not attacking.

31:25.883 --> 31:27.010
You didn't knock it
out of the park.

31:27.093 --> 31:28.094
[dramatic music]

31:32.056 --> 31:33.224
Sara and Clint.

31:36.019 --> 31:39.022
What was it like
working on the same exact area?

31:39.105 --> 31:40.481
I think everybody
would agree

31:40.565 --> 31:42.483
that as far as
a collaboration goes,

31:42.567 --> 31:43.985
this one, by far,
is the most challenging.

31:44.068 --> 31:47.196
This guy wants this
to look like one tattoo.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.323
I've seen
collaborations like this,

31:48.406 --> 31:50.533
I've seen four artists
work on one big back piece

31:50.617 --> 31:51.951
and it looks magnificent,

31:52.035 --> 31:55.079
but you guys didn't
work well together at all.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.957
The end result just isn't--
isn't too good.

31:59.917 --> 32:00.835
Sarah.

32:00.918 --> 32:02.295
The problems I have
with this tattoo...

32:02.378 --> 32:03.838
We're looking
for these gradations

32:03.921 --> 32:06.382
to give these tattoos
dimension and life.

32:06.466 --> 32:10.053
His left forearm,
the shading that's in that arm

32:10.136 --> 32:12.513
is not real shading
of what a real muscle structure

32:12.597 --> 32:14.390
of a real arm would be.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.350
Actually,
that was intentional.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.018
I wanted him to look
more like a statue.

32:17.101 --> 32:20.021
I did use a lot of mid tones
and lighter tones,

32:20.104 --> 32:22.440
but I did use
spots of selective black,

32:22.523 --> 32:24.192
and then blended it out.

32:24.275 --> 32:27.487
The arm and the chest plate
are the same tones.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.156
If he's gonna be statuesque,
there's other ways to use black.

32:30.239 --> 32:32.241
You started to make
the cape darker.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.326
Just commit to it.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.329
Clint.

32:36.412 --> 32:39.040
The head of this devil
is oddly placed

32:39.123 --> 32:40.541
and attached
to this shoulder.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.542
And the back of it,

32:41.626 --> 32:42.919
where his neck would be
over his shoulder,

32:43.002 --> 32:46.214
there's just a black shading
that goes out.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.423
Your anatomy is off.

32:47.507 --> 32:49.050
I'm not trying to make
excuses, but I think Sarah and I

32:49.133 --> 32:51.552
both were tattooing
with one hand behind our back.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.804
What bummed me out
on this thing

32:52.887 --> 32:55.848
is the details in the face
and the horns

32:55.932 --> 32:58.476
and the ripples
in the forehead.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.811
They're just real sketchy.

32:59.894 --> 33:02.146
There are certain little aspects
of this thing that show us

33:02.230 --> 33:03.731
that you can do
these smooth gradients.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.191
But things that we know

33:05.274 --> 33:06.484
you could've done,
you didn't hit 'em.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.528
Man, this [bleep] thing
was hard.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.071
Would you say
that you did gradation

33:10.154 --> 33:11.447
as nice as the rest
of the field

33:11.531 --> 33:12.532
overall throughout
your tattoo?

33:12.615 --> 33:14.617
I have to stand by
the fact that I feel like--

33:14.701 --> 33:15.743
You can't,
because you didn't.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.495
I'm not trying to--
I'm not trying to pick a fight.

33:17.578 --> 33:18.579
We can make this
a bloodbath

33:18.663 --> 33:18.996
or you can understand
what I'm saying.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.084
At this stage of the game,
to get punted

33:23.167 --> 33:25.253
over doing something like this,
you're gonna go home

33:25.336 --> 33:26.087
and kick yourself
in the ass if that happens.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.094
All right, guys.
Head on back to the loft.

33:33.177 --> 33:36.097
For one of you,
it'll be your last visit,

33:36.180 --> 33:38.516
because when you return, someone
will be packing their machines

33:38.599 --> 33:40.518
and closing shop.

33:40.601 --> 33:43.187
[music]

33:52.029 --> 33:52.989
[bleep]!

33:54.949 --> 33:56.033
[exhales]

33:56.784 --> 33:57.702
[bleep].

33:57.785 --> 33:59.454
Don't tell me this tattoo's
all [bleep] up.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.290
Seriously?

34:02.373 --> 34:04.167
[bleep], dude, I'm calling
bull[bleep] on that.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.960
I mean, really?

34:06.043 --> 34:09.172
Baby and Jesse
got their diapers changed,

34:09.255 --> 34:10.465
and they got
their asses kissed,

34:10.547 --> 34:11.716
and they told 'em
how much they love 'em.

34:11.799 --> 34:12.967
Me and her went down there,

34:13.050 --> 34:14.135
and we got beat
like [bleep] stepchildren.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.221
Goddamn it.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.306
They're not gonna make me feel
like a [bleep] bitch over it.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.559
They're not gonna make me feel
like I did a [bleep] tattoo.

34:21.641 --> 34:22.393
I'm just saying like this.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.103
We had to tattoo
at the same time.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.313
They make it sound
like they do that [bleep]

34:26.397 --> 34:27.774
On a [bleep] weekend.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.609
Did they--
Did they not [bleep] say,

34:29.692 --> 34:31.652
"I've seen four guys tattoo
on the back all at once"?

34:31.735 --> 34:33.487
Well, those four mother[bleep]
know each other.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.864
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.949
I'm sorry I didn't [bleep]
do a [bleep] moonwalk

34:37.033 --> 34:38.618
through the Goddamn
minefield more.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.203
What the [bleep]?

34:40.286 --> 34:41.746
[bleep]! [bleep].

34:41.829 --> 34:43.080
{\an5}-[grunts]

34:41.829 --> 34:43.080
-[bleep].

34:45.750 --> 34:47.293
[music]

34:50.004 --> 34:51.672
<i>There's a chance</i>
<i>I could be going home.</i>

34:51.755 --> 34:52.924
<i>I don't see</i>
<i>how I'm gonna be able</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:54.132
to just pick myself up
from this.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.762
Gonna fight for this
mother[bleep].

34:57.845 --> 34:58.596
Fight for this.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.890
I just got my ass
handed to me.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.850
They said
that the neck was weird.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.520
I thought it looked like
it was in the right spot.

35:06.062 --> 35:06.854
[sighs]

35:06.938 --> 35:08.314
I mean, dude,
they could totally see

35:08.397 --> 35:10.358
she's three quarters,
and you're that bottom piece.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.108
And they
crucified her for it.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.195
I mean, really, honestly,

35:14.278 --> 35:17.698
they didn't say anything
was really wrong with mine.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.116
Absolutely.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.452
Actually, I mean, when
it was going on, I was like--

35:21.536 --> 35:22.870
they tore her apart.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.748
{\an8}I'm not ready to leave
the competition.

35:25.832 --> 35:28.292
<i>I'm not gonna leave here</i>
<i>without fighting.</i>

35:28.376 --> 35:29.210
Sarah's going home.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.298
So, it's deliberation time.
Let's start off with Tatu Baby.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.591
I like the shading,

35:35.675 --> 35:38.177
I like the fact that she's still
pounding that black in there

35:38.261 --> 35:39.387
with no reservation.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.972
Another great outing for her.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.683
I really have to go with Steve
for his smooth gradation

35:43.766 --> 35:45.309
and the harsh,
dramatic image, man.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.228
He got a tone to the hair.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.437
{\an8}That's a difficult task,

35:48.521 --> 35:50.606
{\an8}and he did it well by putting
the line work in there.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.816
He did a good job on this.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.234
Who'd be
in the bottom here?

35:53.317 --> 35:55.403
I gotta say it's one of Mark's
best tattoos we've seen,

35:55.486 --> 35:56.904
but against
the rest of the field,

35:56.988 --> 35:58.281
he's definitely in the bottom.

35:58.364 --> 36:01.117
The gradation inside the armor
is, like, really weak.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.494
In weeks past,
Mark has been in the bottom,

36:03.578 --> 36:07.164
and he's given another chance,
but how many passes do you get?

36:07.248 --> 36:09.250
Sarah and Clint are both
very strong tattooers.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.835
Unfortunately for the client,

36:10.918 --> 36:13.421
he got them both
when they were at their worst.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.505
Sarah lost it.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.507
That arm looks like Jell-O.

36:16.591 --> 36:17.466
The anatomy of this thing...

36:17.550 --> 36:19.719
{\an5}-it kills me.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.719
-I agree 100%.

36:19.802 --> 36:20.887
Let's talk
about Clint's devil here.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.598
I think he could've continued
more with the gradation,

36:23.681 --> 36:25.391
putting some more
muscle tone in there.

36:25.474 --> 36:26.726
Or maybe even a vein or two.

36:26.809 --> 36:27.894
It's a really
problematic tattoo.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.147
Once they executed it,
it turned out to be a failure.

36:31.230 --> 36:31.814
Tough decision today, guys.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.066
Want to go get 'em?

36:38.321 --> 36:39.238
Well, I know I'm going down.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.782
Yeah, they were
pretty rough on you guys's.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.869
It was their first chance
to get me in the bottom.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.787
You make it sound like they're
out to get you a little bit.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.080
They are.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.832
I nailed the "Gradation."

36:49.916 --> 36:52.793
It was a good design.
But based on the judging,

36:52.877 --> 36:54.795
it's a tough one
between Clint and Sarah.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.506
[exhales]

37:00.009 --> 37:01.928
All right, guys.
You all ready?

37:02.595 --> 37:03.930
We need to see Tatu Baby,

37:04.013 --> 37:07.391
Sarah, Mark, and Clint.

37:08.517 --> 37:08.851
See you all down there.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.187
Oh, [bleep].

37:11.520 --> 37:14.065
Oh, God.

37:14.148 --> 37:16.108
[dramatic music]

37:16.901 --> 37:18.402
[groans]

37:18.486 --> 37:20.947
[music]

37:27.036 --> 37:29.163
One of you impressed us.

37:29.246 --> 37:31.248
And the other three,
not so much.

37:33.542 --> 37:34.961
The judges have decided

37:35.044 --> 37:35.586
that the best
tattoo of the day...

37:35.670 --> 37:38.381
[music]

37:40.424 --> 37:42.009
Goes to Tatu Baby.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.469
Without a doubt, the best
tattoo we've seen from you.

37:43.552 --> 37:46.889
We've definitely seen
your own style coming out.

37:46.973 --> 37:47.932
Very good tattoo.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.061
Sarah, Mark, and Clint,

37:52.144 --> 37:54.814
your tattoos
did not impress us.

37:56.023 --> 37:56.774
Mark.

37:56.857 --> 37:58.359
The phrase
"Too little too late"

37:58.442 --> 37:59.610
comes to mind
with this tattoo.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.737
Well, I know I've been down here
a handful of times.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.114
I've been fading lately.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.949
But I know the things
that I need to pick up,

38:05.032 --> 38:08.244
so I'm adapting, adjusting, and
doing what I can to progress.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.246
If this would've been
one of your earlier tattoos

38:10.329 --> 38:11.205
and you would've been
climbing that ladder

38:11.288 --> 38:14.083
as opposed to starting
as low as you did,

38:14.166 --> 38:16.544
but everybody else just kind of
started a little ahead of you.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.379
The writing on the wall
says I'm leaving today.

38:18.462 --> 38:21.215
I got a spray can, and if I can
spray something over it

38:21.298 --> 38:22.008
to get you guys
to keep me here,

38:22.091 --> 38:24.218
I'll take my ass whooping,

38:24.301 --> 38:26.429
'cause I guarantee you
the way I came better today,

38:26.512 --> 38:28.139
I'll be that much better
tomorrow.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.641
Clint.

38:30.725 --> 38:31.684
I don't think
that was a bad tattoo.

38:31.767 --> 38:32.685
I know you,

38:32.768 --> 38:35.187
and I know the tattoos
you've done before,

38:35.271 --> 38:37.148
and I know you can do
a better detail than this.

38:37.231 --> 38:38.524
This tattoo,
not a perfect tattoo.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.568
Sometimes you get a real
confident air about yourself.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.237
I think you need to learn
what to be confident about.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.905
You know, I do have
confidence in my work.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.074
I just don't think you guys
are seeing my very best yet.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.200
I still got fight in me.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.411
I'm not done by any means.
That's for damn sure.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.246
Comparing the work
that came out today,

38:52.329 --> 38:54.331
it's undeniable
the way the chips fell.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.249
I don't think you guys
have seen the best yet.

38:55.332 --> 38:57.460
And I sure as hell
ain't ready to go.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.045
Sarah.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.380
We've seen you do things

39:01.464 --> 39:03.507
on both sides of the fence
in this competition.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.218
We've seen you do great designs
with weak execution,

39:06.302 --> 39:08.095
we've seen you
do terrible designs.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.139
This one
is a little bit of both.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.682
There's some elements
of really good design,

39:11.766 --> 39:13.100
but there's
a lot of design flaws.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.311
I fought really hard to be here.

39:15.394 --> 39:16.437
Every single day,
I would push myself

39:16.520 --> 39:20.274
to do one step further
than the day before.

39:20.357 --> 39:21.358
This is not a bad tattoo.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.110
Because we're speaking
comparatively here,

39:23.194 --> 39:24.695
with everything
that's been done today,

39:24.779 --> 39:25.362
it came out lacking.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.573
I'm a really good artist.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.867
And I have passion.
I love what I do.

39:29.950 --> 39:32.036
And if you send me home
for doing a tattoo today

39:32.119 --> 39:33.662
that I loved to do,
then fine.

39:33.746 --> 39:34.997
But I'll continue to fight,

39:35.081 --> 39:36.082
and I'll continue
to push myself

39:36.165 --> 39:38.709
to see things differently,
to grow,

39:38.793 --> 39:42.088
to expand, and even
if you don't see it here,

39:42.171 --> 39:44.048
you'll see it from me
maybe tomorrow,

39:44.131 --> 39:46.050
maybe a month,
or maybe a year from now,

39:46.133 --> 39:46.926
but you'll see it.

39:47.009 --> 39:49.011
I'm not done.
Don't count me out.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.848
Wow.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.016
Whoever is left here today,

39:54.100 --> 39:57.103
y'all need to realize
that the person going home today

39:57.186 --> 39:59.063
didn't go home
for doing a terrible tattoo.

39:59.146 --> 40:00.272
You're going home
because everybody else

40:00.356 --> 40:02.483
might've done
a little bit better.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.609
We're late in the game,

40:03.692 --> 40:05.361
and these decisions
are getting harder for us,

40:05.444 --> 40:07.238
and the challenges
are gonna get harder for you.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.656
There's no more wiggle room.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.950
That is the nature of the game.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.284
This is what happens.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.121
The judges have decided.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.580
[dramatic music]

40:21.335 --> 40:22.962
Mark...

40:23.045 --> 40:25.506
You do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

40:25.589 --> 40:28.676
Mark, looking at how many
times you've been down.

40:28.759 --> 40:29.844
Sarah's been in the top.
You never have.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.513
Clint has been down here.
Not as many times as you.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.599
This came down
strictly to a report card.

40:35.683 --> 40:36.559
Yes, sir.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.435
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

40:40.646 --> 40:41.522
It's not about
how you get knocked down,

40:41.605 --> 40:43.899
<i>it's about</i>
<i>how you get back up.</i>

40:43.983 --> 40:46.694
<i>I made my mistakes,</i>
<i>I bounced back from 'em.</i>

40:46.777 --> 40:48.904
I don't feel I did
the worst tattoo today.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.364
<i>I don't want to leave yet.</i>

40:50.447 --> 40:52.741
<i>This is not the last you're</i>
<i>gonna see of Mark Matthews.</i>

That's not smart.

{\an8}That's insulting.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.602
{\an8}This is a major ball-drop.
You fumbled.
