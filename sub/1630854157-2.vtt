01:04.065 --> 01:06.123
Hi, normal lady.

01:06.141 --> 01:08.625
What are you guys doing?
It's Sunday.

01:08.644 --> 01:11.144
I thought husbands had
to watch football all day

01:11.297 --> 01:12.629
or they get cancer.

01:12.722 --> 01:14.239
Today's our family fun day.

01:14.391 --> 01:18.135
That's right, a whole day
dedicated to family and fun,

01:18.153 --> 01:20.320
ending in the bedroom
with what I hope will be

01:20.472 --> 01:22.139
some back-end participation.

01:22.157 --> 01:24.065
-Hmm?
-Mm-mm.

01:29.331 --> 01:30.589
I am so tired of this family

01:30.740 --> 01:32.816
just sitting around
and doing nothing.

01:32.835 --> 01:34.484
The Browns are outside
having fun

01:34.503 --> 01:35.910
while we're in here
loafing around

01:35.930 --> 01:37.654
like a bunch of stupid potatoes.

01:37.823 --> 01:41.174
Mom, I've been anonymously
cyberbullied for a decade.

01:41.251 --> 01:43.660
"Stupid potato" doesn't even
leave a mark.

01:43.753 --> 01:47.164
We need to spend some quality
time together like the Browns.

01:47.182 --> 01:49.274
So we're doing
a family fun day.

01:49.426 --> 01:51.593
Oh, family-free fun day
sounds great.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.595
No, family fun day.

01:53.689 --> 01:54.855
Yeah, family-free fun day.

01:54.931 --> 01:58.508
No, Peter.
Family. Fun. Day.

All right, nothing's more fun
than a family card game.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.296
Now, the game is euchre.

03:32.028 --> 03:33.437
So, what do you think, gang?

03:33.455 --> 03:35.789
I thought it could be
a fun family activity

03:35.958 --> 03:37.791
if we had a make-your-own-pizza
night.

03:37.943 --> 03:39.292
Or we could order Domino's.

03:39.445 --> 03:41.778
No, come on, this'll be fun.

03:41.797 --> 03:43.222
Everyone gets their own crust,

03:43.373 --> 03:47.133
and you can choose from any
of the items I put out, huh?

03:47.286 --> 03:51.121
It could be olives,
it could be peppers.

03:51.139 --> 03:54.566
And for the risk takers, I even
put out some pineapple.

03:54.718 --> 03:57.827
You can put anything you want
on your pizza.

03:57.829 --> 04:01.481
Yeah, I'm putting a Domino's
pizza on my pizza.

Ah, this is nice, huh?

04:12.402 --> 04:14.644
Oh, it's so good to get
the whole family

04:14.663 --> 04:17.981
out of the house and see Quahog
from a different perspective.

04:18.116 --> 04:19.816
It's a little tight.

04:19.909 --> 04:23.153

-So, how'd you get into
hot-air ballooning?

04:23.155 --> 04:25.155
They don't do background checks.

04:25.248 --> 04:28.934
Oh. What are we
flying over now?

04:29.085 --> 04:30.418
My ex-wife's house.

04:30.512 --> 04:34.164
If you have any garbage
or little bags of cat poo,

04:34.257 --> 04:36.090
you can drop them now.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.261
Did you know restraining orders
only go side to side?

04:40.355 --> 04:42.698
They don't go up and down.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.953
Well, there's got to be
one thing we can all

04:48.180 --> 04:49.513
enjoy together as a family.

04:49.531 --> 04:51.515
You know, I think we're
trying too hard.

04:51.517 --> 04:53.274
When I was a kid
we did movie nights,

04:53.294 --> 04:55.685
and it was the Holy Grail
of family fun.

04:55.779 --> 04:58.188
-I'd watch a movie
-I'd watch a porn movie.

04:58.206 --> 04:59.631
No, a family movie.

04:59.858 --> 05:01.449
I'd watch a MILF porn movie.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.969
Okay, technically
that's accurate, but no porn.

05:04.196 --> 05:06.863
All right, let's fire up
Amazon or Netflix.

05:06.882 --> 05:08.122
No streaming services.

05:08.216 --> 05:09.624
They've ruined how
we watch movies.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.035
I'm talking about
an old-school movie night

05:12.128 --> 05:13.961
where we rent one
from Blockbuster.

05:14.056 --> 05:16.373
Some of my best
childhood memories were when

05:16.391 --> 05:18.208
I went to rent a video
with my dad.

05:18.301 --> 05:19.709
Him and I never really
got along,

05:19.728 --> 05:22.321
but the one place where we did
was Blockbuster.

05:22.472 --> 05:24.714
He'd let me pick out
any snack I wanted

05:24.716 --> 05:26.550
while he grabbed our
fifth-choice movie

05:26.643 --> 05:28.643
because we got there too late
to get the good ones.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.903
But that was part of it,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.312
because it wasn't
about the movie,

05:31.332 --> 05:33.390
it was about the night
you spent together.

05:33.408 --> 05:35.500
I think renting a movie's
a great idea.

05:35.727 --> 05:36.501
Let's do it.

05:36.728 --> 05:37.819
So it's settled.

05:37.913 --> 05:38.986
The Griffins are making it

05:39.006 --> 05:40.339
a Blockbuster night.

05:40.490 --> 05:43.083
When we get there,
I'll give you 20 bucks to say,

05:43.159 --> 05:45.761
"I've heard<i> Magic Mike</i> is good."

05:50.075 --> 05:52.834
Huh. This used to be
the Blockbuster.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.928
Oh, man, it's gone.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.079
Were you also looking for...

05:56.098 --> 05:58.081
Very tall prostitute, yes.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.416
Is that what you were
going to say?

05:59.509 --> 06:02.027
She used to hang out here--
hands like a palm leaf.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.346
She would do sex but also help
with light bulbs and stuff.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.033
I think her name was Phillip.

06:08.184 --> 06:10.535
I see some of my students
in your car.

06:10.687 --> 06:12.454
That's good for me.

06:13.448 --> 06:14.781
I'm sure there's one
still open.

06:14.933 --> 06:16.116
I'll just google it.

06:16.268 --> 06:19.603
Eh, I got to type in my code
'cause I got too fat

06:19.696 --> 06:22.714
-for the facial recognition
to work.
-Brutal.

06:22.866 --> 06:24.774
Oh, good. See?
There is one still open.

Strap in, everybody,

06:40.401 --> 06:42.734
the Griffins are going
on a road trip.

06:42.961 --> 06:45.720
Well, it looks like
the family Griffin

06:45.739 --> 06:49.616
is headed off down Holiday Road.

06:54.415 --> 06:58.232
And Lindsey Buckingham
has said no.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.826
Well, that's all right.

06:59.978 --> 07:01.903
I reckon, if you're
a man named Lindsey,

07:02.030 --> 07:04.214
you don't get to call
the shots very often.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.504
Peter, this is crazy.

07:11.657 --> 07:15.082
We can't drive 3,000 miles
just to rent a movie.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.268
Would you please turn around?

07:16.419 --> 07:18.678
Lois, the whole family fun thing
was your idea.

07:18.755 --> 07:20.513
Don't get mad at me
'cause I'm following through.

07:20.666 --> 07:23.257
But I only have
one pair of underwear.

07:23.351 --> 07:24.684
Oh, that's not a problem.
I got tons of

07:24.761 --> 07:25.944
women's underwear in the back.

07:26.171 --> 07:28.095
(chuckles):
Why, why do you have that?

07:28.190 --> 07:29.189
Tons of it.

07:29.341 --> 07:31.432
Don't we have a say
in all this, Dad?

07:31.452 --> 07:33.285
Yeah, we don't want to drive
all the way to Oregon.

07:33.436 --> 07:34.953

09:42.899 --> 09:44.749
It'll be a quicker death
than this trip.

09:44.901 --> 09:47.460
Guys, look.

09:50.332 --> 09:53.316
Ah! Oh, my God, it's real.

09:53.409 --> 09:55.176
We made it.

09:58.673 --> 10:00.765
Well, I suppose I should be
the responsible one

10:00.992 --> 10:03.326
and release all the car farts.

10:03.495 --> 10:04.677
(flatulence)

10:04.754 --> 10:07.513
You're free now. Go.

10:07.666 --> 10:11.851

10:28.854 --> 10:31.278
This is where kids would come
every Friday night

10:31.298 --> 10:33.189
and see their teacher
wearing jeans.

10:33.208 --> 10:36.283
Dad, who's Christian Slater?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.471
Some actors never made it
out of Blockbuster, Chris.

10:39.622 --> 10:41.473
(insects trilling)

10:43.368 --> 10:44.868
<i> Sliver.</i> Fun movie.

10:44.961 --> 10:46.961

10:50.208 --> 10:53.376
Hmm, it looks like you have
a late fee for<i> Ladyhawke.</i>

10:53.469 --> 10:55.803
Ah, no problem.
How much is it?

10:55.897 --> 10:59.716
$32,419.

10:59.734 --> 11:03.161
Look, uh, we traveled
a really long way to get here,

11:03.312 --> 11:05.646
and I kind of promised
my family a movie night.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.408
Oh. Then the plot
just got interesting.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.168
Where are you on your journey?

11:10.395 --> 11:11.670
About the end of act two?

11:11.821 --> 11:13.579
I read a lot
of screenplay books.

11:13.732 --> 11:15.748
There's got to be some way
we can work this out.

11:15.901 --> 11:18.492
Sorry, but we're pretty strict
about our late fees.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.513
We kind of blew up our
whole company for 'em.

11:21.664 --> 11:23.740
So, no money, no rental.

11:23.742 --> 11:25.742
Uh, $32,000, you say?

12:52.330 --> 12:54.189
Just throw one out.

12:56.501 --> 12:57.942
You know, that movie
still holds up.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.611

doing with me

17:35.963 --> 17:38.464

but I failed.

exciting day ever.

17:46.624 --> 17:50.142
Yeah. We left the house
three days ago to rent a movie

17:50.295 --> 17:52.461
and now we're in the middle
of the woods in Oregon

17:52.555 --> 17:54.906

by Blockbuster guys.

17:55.057 --> 17:56.574

17:56.651 --> 17:58.910
Yeah, we never know
what you're gonna do.

17:59.137 --> 18:01.304
It's usually silly or dangerous,

18:01.322 --> 18:03.230
but it's also kind of awesome.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.308
Yeah. Remember when he had
tiny arms

18:05.401 --> 18:07.919
-for, like, three months?
-Or when he brought home
that horse.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.571

Or that parrot.

18:10.648 --> 18:12.406
Lot of illegal animals.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.000
Or when that little guy
lived in his neck.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.986
What the hell was<i> that?</i>

18:17.004 --> 18:19.079

he fights a giant chicken

18:19.099 --> 18:20.098
and destroys a city.

18:20.249 --> 18:22.249

Well, that Blockbuster adventure
sure was fun,

20:23.389 --> 20:25.038
but we should probably just
watch movies

20:25.132 --> 20:26.206
at home from now on.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.874
You know, Dad,
while we were flying home,

20:27.894 --> 20:30.636
I did order something
special for you.

20:30.730 --> 20:34.047
<i> Sliver!</i> We can still do
our old-school movie night.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.566
I'll hook up the VCR.

20:37.795 --> 20:39.403
Aw, damn it, we can't watch it.

20:39.555 --> 20:40.905
I don't have the right
adaptor cable.

20:41.132 --> 20:42.907
The last Circuit City
in the U.S.

20:43.058 --> 20:45.801
is in St. Augustine, Florida.

20:45.820 --> 20:49.138
-Let's go.
-(all cheer)

Looks like the Griffins are
at it again.

20:53.478 --> 20:56.812
Hi, I'm Jeff Bezos,
and I'm rich and bald.

20:56.905 --> 20:59.632
Guess which one matters.
Good night.
