WEBVTT

00:02.233 --> 00:03.600
THAT WAS AMAZING.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.200
HOW DID YOU HIT
10 FREE THROWS IN A ROW?

00:06.200 --> 00:07.467
NEW SYSTEM.

00:07.467 --> 00:10.600
I REALIZED IF I PICTURE
MYSELF IN A HAPPY PLACE,

00:10.600 --> 00:12.700
ALL THE PRESSURE
GOES AWAY.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.867
SO WHERE IS YOUR HAPPY PLACE?

00:14.867 --> 00:18.100
CAN'T SAY.
YOU MIGHT SHOW UP.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.767
YO, ARWIN.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU RAN.

00:30.767 --> 00:34.700
YEAH. JUST RAN 5 MILES.
I FEEL GREAT.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.567
WHO PUT THE FLOOR HERE?

00:39.567 --> 00:42.200
ARE YOU OK?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.600
YES, MOTHER.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.567
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT EASY.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.767
NO, I CAN'T.
I'M GETTING IN SHAPE

00:47.767 --> 00:49.800
FOR THE ANNUAL
HOTEL ENGINEERS GAMES.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.100
AND THIS YEAR,

00:51.100 --> 00:53.200
I'M GONNA WIN
THE GOLDEN PLUNGER

00:53.200 --> 00:56.233
AND FINALLY BEAT
IRV WHELDON.

00:56.233 --> 00:59.600
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.667
HELLO, WHELDON.

01:01.667 --> 01:04.667
HELLO, HAWKHOUSER.

01:04.667 --> 01:06.867
I JUST CAME BY
TO WISH YOU LUCK.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.033
REALLY?

01:08.033 --> 01:10.500
NO. 'CAUSE YOU'RE A LOSER.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.500
AM NOT.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.500
ARE TOO.
NOT.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.600
TOO. DUHH!

01:13.600 --> 01:16.700
WILL BOTH OF YOU ST--

01:16.700 --> 01:20.467
SEE YOU AT THE GAMES,
HAWK-LOSER.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.600
YOU CAN TAKE
THAT GUY, ARWIN.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.000
MAYBE NOT IN
A DOUGHNUT-EATING
CONTEST, BUT...

01:26.000 --> 01:29.767
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS YEAR I'M GONNA
BE STRONGER, SMARTER,

01:29.767 --> 01:33.467
AND HAVE THE QUICKNESS
OF A JUNGLE CAT. [HISSES]

01:33.467 --> 01:35.100
WATCH IT.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.967
DON'T TOUCH. DON'T TOUCH.
I GOT IT. SEE?

01:37.967 --> 01:40.200
JUNGLE CAT.

01:43.233 --> 01:47.367
GOOD THING THERE'S
NO LUGGAGE IN THE JUNGLE.

MR. MOSEBY, I KNOW
YOU'RE A BUSY MAN,
SO I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.000
I'D LIKE A RAISE.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.567
I'LL MAKE IT QUICKER. NO.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.400
CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT IT?

02:40.400 --> 02:41.567
WE JUST DID.

02:41.567 --> 02:45.200
OH, MOSEBY, DID DADDY OK ME
OPENING UP MY BOUTIQUE

02:45.200 --> 02:46.200
HERE AT THE TIPTON?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.233
HE SENT A FAX,

02:47.233 --> 02:49.900
AND I'M AFRAID HE'S
LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.734
ARE YOU SURE? WELL,
WHAT EXACTLY DID HE SAY?

02:54.900 --> 02:56.934
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:56.934 --> 02:58.100
N-O.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.934
THAT SPELLS "NO."

03:00.934 --> 03:03.500
OH! BUT WHY NOT?

03:03.500 --> 03:06.300
EVERY TIME
YOU START A PROJECT,
YOU TEND TO QUIT.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.500
NAME ONE.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
THERE WAS THE TIME YOU
WANTED TO BE AN EQUESTRIAN,

03:09.500 --> 03:11.867
SO YOUR FATHER BOUGHT YOU
A STABLE FULL OF HORSES.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.867
YOU WALKED IN
THEN WALKED RIGHT OUT.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.667
IT SMELLED LIKE HORSEYS.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.100
THE TIME YOU WANTED
TO BE A DANCER,

03:17.100 --> 03:19.467
SO WE BOUGHT YOU
THAT RUSSIAN BALLET TEACHER.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.767
THE HORSEYS SMELLED BETTER.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.967
THERE WAS THE TIME
THAT YOU WANTED
TO BE AN ICE SKATER.

03:23.967 --> 03:26.300
LET ME GUESS.
HE BOUGHT YOU
AN ICE RINK.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.600
HE BOUGHT HER ICELAND.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.700
OK. SO I QUIT A FEW THINGS.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.367
BUT THIS TIME
IT'S DIFFERENT.

03:33.367 --> 03:36.100
I'M AFRAID YOUR FATHER
IS NOT GONNA PAY
FOR THE LATEST WHIM.

03:36.100 --> 03:39.233
BUT I DON'T WANT A WHIM.
I WANT A STORE.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.133
LONDON, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PAY FOR IT YOURSELF.

03:42.133 --> 03:46.800
FINE. I'LL USE THE $10
GRANDMA GAVE ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

03:46.800 --> 03:51.200
LONDON, $10 IS NOT ENOUGH
TO OPEN UP A STORE.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.400
I KNOW.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.033
BUT THE $10 WAS WRAPPED
AROUND A DIAMOND

03:55.033 --> 03:56.767
THE SIZE OF A POTATO.

03:56.767 --> 04:00.834
AND I'M GONNA USE
MY POTATO DIAMOND
TO OPEN UP MY BUSINESS.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.200
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.500
DONE.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.734
A MINUTE AND 10 SECONDS.

04:08.734 --> 04:11.133
OH! I'LL NEVER BEAT IRV.

04:11.133 --> 04:13.400
I'M SUCH A LOSER.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.467
LOSER! LOSER! LOSER!

04:16.467 --> 04:19.400
YOU GOT TO BE
MORE POSITIVE. TRY THIS.

04:19.400 --> 04:22.000
WINNER! WINNER! WINNER!

04:24.667 --> 04:27.600
THAT DOESN'T WORK
SO WELL EITHER.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.934
WELL, I'VE GOT
A GREAT TECHNIQUE
TO KEEP FROM GETTING NERVOUS.

04:30.934 --> 04:32.400
THINK OF A HAPPY PLACE,

04:32.400 --> 04:34.400
AND ALL THE PRESSURE
WILL JUST MELT AWAY.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.834
WELL, THANKS. BUT NO MATTER
HOW HAPPY THE PLACE,

04:37.834 --> 04:40.300
IT'LL NEVER BE ME
UP ON THAT WINNER'S PODIUM

04:40.300 --> 04:41.734
ACCEPTING THE GOLDEN PLUNGER

04:41.734 --> 04:44.767
AND A KISS
FROM THE PLUNGER GIRL.

04:44.767 --> 04:46.400
COME ON, GUYS.
TIME TO GET HOME.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.734
CAN'T WE STAY
A LITTLE LONGER, MOM?

04:48.734 --> 04:52.000
I'M SORRY. BUT I'VE GOT
TO GET UPSTAIRS AND WORK
ON THIS STUPID SONG.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
THE TIPTON'S HOSTING
SOME KIND OF GEEK GAMES.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.700
MOSEBY'S MAKING ME SING
AT THE OPENING CEREMONIES

04:59.700 --> 05:02.133
AND HAND OUT
THE GOLDEN PLUNGER.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.500
YOU'RE THE PLUN--PLUN--
PLUN--PLUN--PLUN--

05:07.500 --> 05:09.667
PLUNGER GIRL?

05:11.100 --> 05:14.500
WHELDON'S GOING DOWN.

05:20.367 --> 05:23.500
CAN SOMEONE MAYBE
GIVE ME A HAND?

05:23.500 --> 05:26.300
NOBODY ELSE IS IN HERE.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.200
LONDON, HOW'S IT GOING?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.300
IT'S GOING TO BE FABBY.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.400
I'M GONNA PUT PURSES
OVER HERE

05:36.400 --> 05:38.467
AND MATCHING BELTS
OVER THERE.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.133
AND DO YOU HAVE
A BUSINESS PLAN?

05:40.133 --> 05:42.400
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING?

05:42.400 --> 05:45.600
I'M GONNA PUT PURSES OVER HERE
AND MATCHING BELTS OVER THERE.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.467
NO, NO, NO. HE'S TALKING
ABOUT FINANCIAL PLANNING.

05:48.467 --> 05:50.867
ORDERING STOCK,
TAKING INVENTORY.

05:52.734 --> 05:55.367
I SAID I'M PUTTING
PURSES OVER HERE

05:55.367 --> 05:57.300
AND MATCHING BELTS OVER THERE.

05:57.300 --> 06:00.767
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
PUTTING THE PURSES.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.300
I'M SORRY.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.400
IT'S JUST THAT
IT TAKES A LITTLE MORE

06:05.400 --> 06:08.033
THAN JUST PUTTING THINGS
ON SHELVES TO RUN A STORE.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.200
HE'S RIGHT.
TAKE THE CANDY COUNTER.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.700
IT'S NOT JUST NOUGATS
AND NUTS, YOU KNOW.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.367
HEY, THAT WAS
KIND OF FUNNY TO SAY.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.867
NOUGATS AND NUTS.
NOUGATS AND NUTS.
NOUGATS AND NUTS.

06:17.867 --> 06:21.200
NOUGATS AND NUTS.
NOUGATS AND NUTS.
OK, THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.033
WELL, HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU COME WORK HERE

06:24.033 --> 06:26.033
AND DO YOUR
BUSINESS-TYPE STUFF FOR ME?

06:26.033 --> 06:27.300
I ALREADY HAVE A JOB.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.467
WHICH YOU'RE
NOT DOING RIGHT NOW.

06:29.467 --> 06:31.500
I'LL PAY YOU DOUBLE.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.033
AND NOW I HAVE
A NEW JOB.

06:34.033 --> 06:35.500
SORRY, MR. MOSEBY.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.700
I'M MOVING ON
TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.667
I BET YOU REGRET NOT
GIVING ME THAT RAISE NOW.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.133
AH. OH, NO.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.400
WHERE WILL I FIND
ANOTHER TEENAGER

06:45.400 --> 06:47.734
LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT
AT A 5-STAR HOTEL?

06:47.734 --> 06:50.200

07:39.367 --> 07:41.367
THE FIRST EVENT
IS IN 10 MINUTES.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.200
HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR
HAPPY PLACE TO THINK ABOUT?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.233
WELL, ACTUALLY, AT FIRST,

07:45.233 --> 07:49.033
IT WAS ME AND MOTHER
ON A LOVELY TROPICAL CRUISE.

07:49.033 --> 07:52.300
BUT THEN A STORM HIT,
AND THE WAVES WERE HUGE.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.934
AND THEN HER WHEELCHAIR
ROLLED OFF THE SIDE

07:53.934 --> 07:57.767
AND I YELLED, "MOTHER,
THROW ME THE HOUSE KEYS!"

07:59.667 --> 08:01.700
OK.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.100
HOW ABOUT THINKING
ABOUT A NICE COOKIE?

08:06.100 --> 08:07.867
OOH, THAT'LL WORK.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.000
GENTLEMEN, IT'S TIME
TO START OUR FIRST EVENT.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.667
THE TOOLBOX DASH.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.667
SO TAKE IT AWAY,
PLUNGER GIRL.

08:18.667 --> 08:21.834
OH, I'M NOT TAKING
ANYTHING ANYWHERE.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.767
ALL RIGHT, FIRST ONE DOWN
TO THE FIRE HYDRANT AND BACK

08:25.767 --> 08:27.400
WITH THEIR TOOLBOX WINS.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.300
OK, ARWIN,
THINKING OF YOUR COOKIE?

08:29.300 --> 08:31.967
OH, YEAH. IT'S GOT
CHOCOLATE CHIPS
AND WALNUTS.

08:31.967 --> 08:34.400
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.600
I EVEN ADDED SPRINKLES.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.000
JUST GO.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.667
WHAT? OH!

08:49.100 --> 08:51.400
WHAT TIME'S LUNCH?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.200
AT 12:30.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.500
THINK I'LL HAVE SOME SOUP.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.000
IT'S LENTIL.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.200
SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THE BISQUE.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.100
I AM THE WINNER!

09:09.100 --> 09:10.700
ALL RIGHT!

09:10.700 --> 09:13.867
ENJOY IT NOW, HAWK-LOSER,

09:13.867 --> 09:15.200
BECAUSE WHEN
THE GAMES ARE OVER,

09:15.200 --> 09:17.834
IT'LL BE ME GETTING
THAT GOLDEN PLUNGER

09:17.834 --> 09:21.400
AND A KISS FROM YONDER
FAIR-HAIRED BEAUTY.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.400
DON'T YOU CALL OUR MOM
A "FAIR-HAIRED BEAUTY."

09:24.400 --> 09:26.600
YEAH. YOU SHOULD
SEE HER IN THE MORNING.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.300
THERE AIN'T NOTHING
BEAUTIFUL ABOUT IT.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.400
DONE!

09:39.400 --> 09:42.200
IN YOUR FACE, WHELDON.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.133
IS IT, HAWKHOUSER?

09:44.133 --> 09:46.233
TURN IT ON.

09:49.834 --> 09:51.400
OH!

09:51.400 --> 09:54.000
ISN'T IT SUPPOSED
TO BLOW OUT?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.600
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHANGE
YOUR NAME FROM AR-WIN

09:56.600 --> 09:58.400
TO AR-LOSE.

10:03.367 --> 10:04.667
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:04.667 --> 10:08.467
I DON'T KNOW.
I COULD'VE SWORN--

10:08.467 --> 10:11.000
WAIT A MINUTE.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.100
THIS IS A CUNNINGHAM
200 ON/OFF SWITCH.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.767
I COULD HAVE SWORN
I USED A FONZARELLI 22.

10:15.767 --> 10:18.834
A BONEHEAD MISTAKE.

10:18.834 --> 10:20.367
[WHIRRING]

10:21.367 --> 10:23.734
I DESERVE TO LOSE.

10:25.867 --> 10:28.467
HEY, PLUNGER GIRL.

10:28.467 --> 10:31.700
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR OUR LIPS TO MEET.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.734
I JUST...I JUST
THREW UP A LITTLE BIT.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.800
BOY, YOU KNOW,
IT SURE ISN'T LIKE ARWIN

10:44.800 --> 10:46.467
TO MAKE A MISTAKE LIKE THAT.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.200
YEAH.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.300
ISN'T IT WEIRD
HOW IRV SEEMED
TO KNOW IT WOULDN'T WORK?

10:52.300 --> 10:53.800
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:58.300 --> 11:02.467
THE FONZARELLI 22.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

11:02.467 --> 11:05.233
I WILL AS SOON AS YOU TELL ME.

11:05.233 --> 11:07.200
IT MEANS IRV'S CHEATING.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.600
LOOK.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.467
"PROPERTY OF ARWIN."

11:10.467 --> 11:12.600
WE CAN'T LET IRV STEAL
THE GOLDEN PLUNGER,

11:12.600 --> 11:14.867
AND WE DEFINITELY
CAN'T LET HIM KISS MOM.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.934
Both: UGH!

11:19.100 --> 11:21.734
SO HAVE WE SOLD
ANYTHING YET?

HOW TO USE TOILET PAPER.

THEY WERE HERE.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.767

FLUSHED THEM.

WAS CLOSE TO YOUR HEART.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.500
WAY MORE THAN WE MADE.

WE LOST MONEY.
