00:06.000 --> 00:08.287
- Shh.
- Ruby: Baal doesn't use brute force.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.927
He breeds paranoia, gets into people's
psyches, turning them against each other.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.004
- (crowd screaming)
- Ruby: The Necronomicon is the only way

00:15.200 --> 00:16.690
we can banish Baal
back to the underworld.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.605
The book, it did something to me.
It changed me.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.684
- You're becoming one with the book.
- (chanting in foreign language)

00:22.840 --> 00:25.525
- (Chet yells)
- Just you and me now, Chet.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.160
Cheryl, this only feels
half as good as it used to.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.651
- (Chet grunts)
- Chet!

00:33.280 --> 00:36.329
And that, Elk Grove,
is how you take care of business.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.731
Ash, behind you!

00:38.880 --> 00:40.644
Shh.

00:41.160 --> 00:45.484
Audrey: Wouldn't it be much easier
to work together?

00:48.960 --> 00:51.486
(garbled voice plays on recorder)

00:51.640 --> 00:53.802
(clock chimes)

00:54.960 --> 00:56.610
(roars)

00:56.760 --> 00:58.444
(screaming)

01:01.800 --> 01:04.531
- (evil laughter)
- (chainsaw buzzing)

01:06.000 --> 01:08.765
Ah!
(panting)

01:10.320 --> 01:12.243
Oh.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.328
Ow.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.371
Where am I?

01:51.240 --> 01:53.208
(indistinct whispering)

01:55.640 --> 01:57.404
(faint growling)

02:05.160 --> 02:07.686
You had the nightmare again?

02:08.240 --> 02:10.686
Where'd you come from?

02:10.840 --> 02:12.888
Who are you?

02:13.040 --> 02:15.520
You don't know who I am today?

02:17.040 --> 02:19.247
Never saw your mug before
in my life.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.165
Hmm. Memory loss.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.721
It's not a positive development.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.405
I'm Dr. Peacock.
Your psychiatrist, remember?

02:28.560 --> 02:31.325
(chuckles)
My shrink?

02:31.480 --> 02:34.290
Ah, well, boy,
the joke's on you there, Doc,

02:34.440 --> 02:35.726
'cause I don't have a shrink.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.890
I don't even have health care.
In fact, I do my own surgery.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.285
Dr. Peacock:
That's for your own safety.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.922
You've been becoming
increasingly violent of late.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.560
Ash, I've been your doctor
ever since your psychotic break.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.610
My what?
My psychotic break?

02:50.760 --> 02:52.171
Yes, Ash.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.845
You murdered
four people in a cabin.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.923
Oh, Christ!

02:56.080 --> 02:58.651
Here we go
with that horseshit again.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.922
Uh... you know what?

03:03.080 --> 03:04.923
That wasn't me, Doc.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.804
That was some evil BS.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.088
After the murders,
you created a complex delusion

03:09.240 --> 03:11.242
to justify your actions.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.164
It all hinged on an evil book.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.687
Ever since then, I've been trying to
help you pinpoint that delusion,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.166
and destroy it.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.641
Okay, so you want to...

03:20.800 --> 03:22.609
destroy my delusion?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.290
That's right.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.046
Rid yourself of the book,
and the nightmare will be over.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.884
Okay-

03:29.040 --> 03:32.283
You know, Doc,
I think I'm starting to get it.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.721
Good.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.804
I know who you are.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.042
You are that demon Bill.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.288
Oh, sorry, Baal.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.570
And you know that that book
can send you back, right?

03:46.720 --> 03:49.963
So you want to scramble my brain
until I give it to you.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.161
Well, think again.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.563
The only person
who scrambles my brain, pal, is me,

03:54.720 --> 03:58.042
by doing the fun stuff,
like drinking glue and sniffing booze!

03:58.200 --> 03:59.804
Ash, I can't breathe!

03:59.960 --> 04:01.610
They said that you were crafty.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.245
You led me right to you.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.041
Now I'm going to kill you,
just like I killed your father!

04:07.200 --> 04:09.487
(chuckles)
I didn't really kill your father,

04:09.680 --> 04:11.125
that just kind of sounded cool.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.089
The point is you're dead!

04:13.240 --> 04:15.242
Ash, it's me, your doctor.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.726
You know, Ruby said
this would be hard.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.723
Buddy, I've had harder turds.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.962
You are a joke of a demon!

04:22.120 --> 04:24.202
(grunts)

04:34.200 --> 04:36.646
Dr. Peacock: We will break you
of these delusions, Ash.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.286
- I'm not giving up on you.
- Yeah?

04:41.120 --> 04:45.728
Well, you can suck
my saggy bills...

04:47.040 --> 04:48.963
Baal.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.042
(music playing)

04:58.200 --> 05:00.168
(mumbling)

05:03.440 --> 05:05.966
- (groaning)
- No.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.043
No! No!

05:17.160 --> 05:18.764
What did you do to me?

05:18.960 --> 05:21.440
You're the hardest patient
I've ever treated, Ash.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.161
Most people, after a brief discussion,
see things my way.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.402
Not you, though.
You're special.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.608
Yeah, I'll show you special.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.764
I'll shove you on that short bus
straight back to hell, buddy.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.811
You have to understand
that my reality is reality, Ashley.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.248
- Does the patient need...
- The patient needs

05:42.440 --> 05:45.091
to get out of this dump and tell
his friends that he found the demon!

05:45.280 --> 05:47.442
We're fine in here, nurse.
We're making progress.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.409
Oh, no, we're not, we're...

05:52.120 --> 05:53.770
Ruby?

05:53.920 --> 05:57.208
Ruby! He's right here!
We can finish this!

05:57.360 --> 05:59.124
- I'll come back later.
- No, no, no!

05:59.280 --> 06:01.282
Don't go!
Tell Pablo...

06:01.440 --> 06:03.807
And Kelly?

06:03.960 --> 06:05.610
You better not hurt them.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.720
How could I hurt them?
They're all in your head.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.483
You invented this entire narrative.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.205
The team, the book,

06:14.360 --> 06:15.964
so that you wouldn't
have to face the truth.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.646
You murdered your friends
in cold blood.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.245
Says you, Captain Creepy.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.967
(sighs)

06:26.120 --> 06:29.408
I think it's time
that we tried a new tactic.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.961
Seeing as you're unable
to face reality by yourself,

06:32.160 --> 06:35.403
I've brought in a friend
who might be able to help.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.166
- Meet Ashy Slashy.
- A puppet.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.210
I hate puppets!
Even stunningly handsome ones.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.249
Get that out of here!

06:47.120 --> 06:49.885
See, it's easy.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.888
Okay, this is not me.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.929
- I'm not doing this.
- Right.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.242
Just like you didn't kill your friends.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.841
Hey, pal, what's the scoop?

07:04.800 --> 07:07.007
Ah, come on,
you can talk to me, Ash.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.525
I'm all ears.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.369
- This is dumb.
- You're dumb.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.851
- You're dumb!
- You're old!

07:13.000 --> 07:14.570
You're short!

07:14.720 --> 07:17.007
How is this happening?
Whose side are you even on?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.043
I'm on our side, Ash.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.568
I'm you, but the part of you
who's willing to face reality.

07:22.720 --> 07:27.044
Who believes the doctor.
Who wants to face the delusions.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.249
Let's rid ourselves
of the Necronomicon, Ash.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.323
We don't need it anymore.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.727
Ruby, get back in here
and help me.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.201
- Tell him I'm not crazy!
- There is no Ruby.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.250
No Kelly. No Pablo.
You made it all up!

07:43.440 --> 07:45.522
No. No!
They're real!

07:49.040 --> 07:50.041
Ah!

07:51.720 --> 07:53.245
Give in.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.084
Let the doctor help us.

07:55.280 --> 07:59.649
Get your filthy puppet butthole
off of my arm!

07:59.800 --> 08:03.521
(yells, groans)

08:03.680 --> 08:05.967

- (exhales sharply, sniffs) Oh, God!
- (flies buzzing)

09:25.520 --> 09:28.490
Somebody light a candle.
It smells like death in here.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.649
What are you doing in my room?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.366
Oh. Oh, nothing.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.763
Don't worry about it. I'm just--
I'm just in your imagination.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.327
Are you a ghost?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.010
Kelly?

09:47.160 --> 09:49.003
Oh, you're here to help me!

09:49.160 --> 09:50.241
- Sweet!
- (grunts)

09:50.440 --> 09:52.568
Ooh, you don't smell so sweet,
but, you know,

09:52.720 --> 09:54.848
that's nothing ten
or 12 showers can't fix.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.169
I know who you are.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.724
Murderer. Murderer!

10:04.880 --> 10:07.042
- (yelling continues)
- Shh!

10:07.200 --> 10:09.601
Inside voice.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.889
All right, let me ask you a question.
How long have I been here?

10:15.320 --> 10:16.890
You've been here forever.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.361
(chuckling) Oh, no.
No, that's not possible.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.045
At least I don't think it's possible.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.884
Well, how would you know anyway?

10:23.040 --> 10:25.930
Because I'm very good
at keeping count.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.882
It's what I do.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.929
See?

10:31.080 --> 10:33.731
I've been here for six years,

10:33.880 --> 10:36.611
three months, and five days.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.803
- Let me show you how I count.
- What's that?

10:41.880 --> 10:42.881
- (bones cracking)
' (gasps)

10:43.040 --> 10:45.520
- One!
- Ooh, no! That's so not necessary!

10:46.200 --> 10:48.487
- Oh, Kelly! Stop doing that.
- Two!

10:49.560 --> 10:51.130
- Three!
- You're going to run out of fingers.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.886
(laughing maniacally)

10:54.680 --> 10:56.648
Somebody get me out of here!

10:57.560 --> 10:59.528

- (Ash grunts)

11:02.920 --> 11:05.082
Pablo!
Oh, thank God you're here!

11:05.240 --> 11:06.890
You got to get me out of here.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.964
Baal put the whammy on Kelly.
Now she's crazy as a mad cow.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.804
Shut your trap, Slashy!

11:11.960 --> 11:13.962
On the ground,
hands behind your back now!

11:14.120 --> 11:16.248
- What? Why?
- You know the drill.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.965
Oh, watch the hair!

11:18.120 --> 11:19.610
Pablo, what are you doing?!

11:19.760 --> 11:21.762
(maniacal laughter continues)

11:25.440 --> 11:29.126
You can't escape, Ash.
You must face your delusions.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.851
Yeah, I'm facing my delusions,
because they're real, asshole.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.963
Oh, I'll show you real.

Oh, whoo!

11:55.720 --> 11:58.929
That's like doing whippets!
Can we go again, Doc?

11:59.080 --> 12:01.686
It saddens me
that your treatment is failing.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.640
After all these years of passivity,
you've become too violent.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.327
We need to break
this delusion, Ash, for good.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.323
- (machine powering on)
- For everyone's safety.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.051
We need to destroy this "book"
that you're obsessed with.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.884
You're not going to break me,
Poindexter.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.486
You can go ahead
and pull that trigger again.

Dr. Peacock:
You're not the Jefe, Ash.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.082
You're not the savior of humanity.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.286
Kill the book, Ash.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.686
Kill the book.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.366
- (zapping continues)
- (table whirring)

12:39.600 --> 12:41.728
You will be my henchman.

You will be my slaughterman.

Do you have a beer?

12:55.080 --> 12:57.208
Huh?

12:58.520 --> 13:01.251
Ash:
Chet, you're alive.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.802
Wait a second, Chet,
you can't be here.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.521
- Cheryl ripped your heart out.
- Amen to that, brother.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.200

Oh, Doc, that was a-a little
on the spicy side, even for me.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.610
Oh... how you doing, buddy?

13:41.520 --> 13:44.251
Chet... oh.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.925
Oh, they killed you again.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.605
- (machine powering on)
- That is so not coo--

13:47.800 --> 13:49.848
- (electrodes zapping)
- (grunting)

13:52.240 --> 13:54.686
(evil laughter)

13:55.760 --> 13:57.524
(music playing on TV)

13:57.680 --> 14:01.480
Man on TV: ...was a matter
more of principal products.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.768
Principal products?

14:03.920 --> 14:06.924
Oh, you know, like,
uh, principal products...

14:07.080 --> 14:09.082
(voices echoing)

14:13.760 --> 14:17.606
- (indistinct on TV)
- Baal: Kill the book.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.366
Kill the book.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.603
- (indistinct chatter)
- Kill the book.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.286
Dr. Peacock's voice:
You're not the Jefe, Ash.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.410
- (indistinct whispering continues)
- You're not the savior of humanity.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.281
Kill the book, Ash.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.681
Kill the book.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.808
Finally, you're back.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.849
What took so long?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.651
Listen, I know
what's happening around here.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.327
And obviously I had my doubts about
you following the Baal plan without me,

14:56.480 --> 14:59.723
but, you know, I'm willing to be
proven wrong, this once.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.644
Stop talking to me.
I'm working here.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.723
Oh, I like it.
You're staying in character.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.049
Hey, after we get out,
how about some role-playing?

15:07.200 --> 15:10.409
Maybe Nurse Ratched needs
a little injection from Dr. Groovy.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.164
What do you say?

15:12.320 --> 15:15.324
Get your dope glazed eyes off of me
and back on that TV,

15:15.480 --> 15:17.847
you murdering pervert.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.163
Wow. Okay.
Yeah, uh, I'll just wait for your signal.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.845
(chuckles)

15:23.000 --> 15:25.207
Whoa! Jesus!

15:25.400 --> 15:28.006
You almost scared me.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.244
Ash, they locked us up
because we know the truth!

15:38.400 --> 15:41.290
And they're taking us out,
one by one.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.850
All right.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.044
I know what to do.
Follow my lead.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.531
- (yells)
<i>'</i> (gasps)

15:53.720 --> 15:55.290
(laughing)

15:57.840 --> 16:00.286
(screaming)

16:02.160 --> 16:05.562
Okay, you crazies,
express yourselves!

16:05.720 --> 16:08.007
(all screaming, laughing)

16:23.320 --> 16:24.481
Put it-- put it down!

16:27.920 --> 16:29.922
- Stop!
- Ash: Pablo.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.330
(groaning)

16:48.240 --> 16:51.369
(grunts)
Son of a-- son of a-- don't--

16:51.520 --> 16:52.931
Don't hit me anymore.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.605
Don't do it...

16:54.760 --> 16:57.525
Wakey-wakey,
hands off your snaky!

16:58.280 --> 17:00.521
Oh, I'm-I'm not. I just...

17:02.360 --> 17:04.646
(gasps) Ash!

17:04.800 --> 17:07.406
You're going to get us in big trouble.
What are you doing?

17:08.960 --> 17:11.611
I'm busting out of here,
that's what I'm doing.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.007
Now, listen,
you mind your P's and Q's,

17:14.160 --> 17:15.810
I'll see to it
that you're taken care of.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.007
Keep talking.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.162
Uh, how about a Lil' Lori Doll

17:19.319 --> 17:21.448
you can put
your puppet privates into, huh?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.165
I like where your head's at.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.721
Almost as much as I like
where your nub's at.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.644
- Hoo.
- That's disgusting.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.327
But you know I can't be mad, 'cause
that's exactly what I would of said.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.084
(laughter)

17:38.720 --> 17:40.961
Huh? Yeah.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.160
Uh-huh. Oh.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.809
(humming)

17:57.000 --> 17:59.685
(beeps, unlocks)

18:01.680 --> 18:03.330
What the Fraggle Rock
is that thing?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.084
It's a long story.
Come on, we got to split.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.890
You're not even
going to introduce us?

18:07.040 --> 18:09.691
Come on, throw a dog a bone.
I mean, look at her.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.366
- She's filthy.
- And fine. Yeah, I know.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.851
(whispers)
What? What's fine?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.968
- That tiny behind, sister.
- Hey, shut up!

18:16.120 --> 18:18.122
You shut the fuck up!

18:20.200 --> 18:21.929
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey!

18:22.120 --> 18:23.770
Focus up.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.202
(whispers)
Okay, I'll distract him.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.805
You get the door, okay?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.403
(pill skittering)

18:58.480 --> 19:00.562
Somebody there?

19:04.240 --> 19:06.242
(pills skittering)

19:06.400 --> 19:08.846
- (Taser gun zaps)
- Who's there?

19:32.680 --> 19:34.762
(beeps)

19:36.600 --> 19:38.364
(beeps)

19:40.240 --> 19:42.004
Kelly: Let's go!
What's taking so long?

19:42.200 --> 19:45.124
- Stupid thing is busted!
- (alarm blaring)

19:47.240 --> 19:50.005
Oh, dip, people are
definitely gonna to hear that.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.167
No. I gotta get out!

19:54.320 --> 19:57.403
- (Kelly grunts)
- (Pablo groans)

20:05.120 --> 20:08.442
Kelly, what the hell did you do?!

20:08.640 --> 20:09.971
He was a demon.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.327
I had to kill him
before he killed us.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.568
He's not a demon.
That's Pablo!

20:14.720 --> 20:17.041
He was my friend!
He was your friend, too!

20:17.200 --> 20:20.010
His name wasn't Pablo.
It was Reg.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.650
Just like my name isn't Kelly.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.485
It's Amanda, you wack job!

20:24.640 --> 20:27.166
Wait a second.
This isn't right.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.324
- Who's Reg?!
- Reg was a demon.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.811
A dragon demon.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.561
So I had to slay him,
just like we talked about, remember?

20:35.720 --> 20:38.041
No! No!

20:38.200 --> 20:40.680
There's no dragons
in the Necronomicon!

20:40.880 --> 20:44.327
There's a Kandarian demon that flies
around and makes-makes Deadites!

20:44.480 --> 20:47.006
Okay, right, so what, they-they
can't survive in sunlight?

20:47.160 --> 20:49.322
- Those are vampires!
- Don't you mean Bloodites?

20:49.480 --> 20:52.165
Oh, wait, there was that one time
that the sunlight did work.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.483
Oh, listen to yourself!
You're fucking nuts!

20:55.640 --> 20:58.564
Look who's talking to who!
You thought Pablo was a dragon!

20:58.720 --> 21:01.769
His name was Reg!

21:01.920 --> 21:05.481
- (grunting)
- Stop it. Stop it, Looney Tune.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.691
Reg! Reg!

21:12.440 --> 21:14.568
What the hell?

21:14.720 --> 21:16.643
Oh, Jesus Christ!

21:20.000 --> 21:21.206
Oh...

21:21.360 --> 21:23.886
(gasps)
It wasn't me.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.883
I didn't do this!

21:26.040 --> 21:28.520
Yes, you did.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.523
You're a murderer.
(echoes)

21:36.360 --> 21:38.044
No!

21:38.200 --> 21:41.488
- No! No! No!
- (Taser guns Zapping)

21:41.640 --> 21:43.642

21:46.720 --> 21:48.722

21:52.560 --> 21:54.562
(banging, splattering on TV)

21:55.840 --> 21:57.842
(static crackling)

21:59.720 --> 22:02.724
Dr. Peacock: I'm truly sorry
to make you watch this, Ash.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.764
I simply can't find any other way

22:05.920 --> 22:08.161
to impress upon you
how increasingly violent

22:08.320 --> 22:11.244
and unstable
your behavior has become.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.209
That's not me.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.810
I'm afraid it is, Ash.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.325
- (Ash grunting)
- (Amanda screaming)

22:19.520 --> 22:21.966
Dr. Peacock:
As I'm afraid I've failed you.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.088
I'm transferring you
to another facility.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.724
One that's better equipped to deal
with patients like you.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.442
I'm sorry to say that
their treatment methods are...

22:32.600 --> 22:34.568
less progressive than mine.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.281
- Barbaric even.
- That's not me.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.330
(Dr. Peacock sighs)
Very well.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.602
I've arranged a visitor for you.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.643
A farewell.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.529
(grunting on TV continues)

23:04.280 --> 23:06.123
Linda: Ash?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.610
Oh, my God.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.849
What've they done to you?

23:13.480 --> 23:15.448
(footsteps)

23:21.400 --> 23:23.562
It's me.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.404
Linda.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.242
You're not real.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.561
You're in my imagination.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.164
You're still here?

23:42.320 --> 23:45.642
Yes, it's me.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.882
Linda, Ash.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.565
Linda B.

23:49.720 --> 23:54.169
I've been visiting you here
for the last 30 years.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.403
30 years?

24:01.600 --> 24:04.410
- I think I'm losing my mind.
- No...

24:04.560 --> 24:06.369
(grunts)

24:23.560 --> 24:25.881
(tires squeal)

24:44.160 --> 24:45.685
I'm sorry, Linda.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.166
I have to go away for a long time.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.084
I don't think
I'll ever see you again.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.645
Why, Ash?

24:58.160 --> 25:00.162
Because now I understand.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.243
(screaming, banging on TV)

25:02.400 --> 25:04.846
That's me.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.447
' (door opens)
- (footsteps approaching)

25:19.280 --> 25:21.567
You ready to go, Ash?

25:23.920 --> 25:25.046
Ash?

25:25.760 --> 25:27.125
I did it.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.521
What's that, Ash?
What'd you do?

25:34.040 --> 25:35.804
I did it all.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.006
I murdered my friends
at that cabin.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.408
I murdered my sister, Cheryl.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.568
The patient, the orderly.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.930
I did it all.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.804
That's good, Ash.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.970
Very good.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.721
You know what you have to do now,
though, don't you?

26:08.320 --> 26:10.527
No. I don't.

26:10.680 --> 26:13.331
- You need to listen to me.
- I will.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.484
Shh.
No more talking.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.325
You're mine now.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.847
First, you have to destroy
this delusion.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.241
You must destroy
the Necronomicon.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.004
- Can you do that, Ash?
- Yes.

26:27.160 --> 26:31.688
- Say it.
- I must destroy the book.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.162
- Again!
- I must destroy

26:35.360 --> 26:37.010
the Necronomicon!

26:44.200 --> 26:45.884
Go ahead, Ash.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.128
(chains clink)

26:48.280 --> 26:50.487
Do it.
