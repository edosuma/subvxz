00:01.210 --> 00:03.128
- [Nisha] They're all available?
- [Graham] Beauty.

00:03.212 --> 00:04.838
Available for what?

00:04.922 --> 00:06.673
- You guys all know
I'm a shutterbug right?

00:06.757 --> 00:09.051
Have you seen my website,
Instagraham?

00:09.134 --> 00:10.802
Yeah. No, we tried
to look you up on Instagram.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.930
- [Graham] No, no.
- No, no. "Instagraham"

00:13.013 --> 00:14.723
like his name. There's an H.

00:14.806 --> 00:17.935
- H. I used to only wanna
photograph birds of prey.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.311
And then I met your mom

00:19.394 --> 00:22.272
and she got me
turned on to humans.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.233
- Well.
- [imitates shutter clicking]

00:25.651 --> 00:27.486
We have a surprise.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.321
- Please don't get married.
- Dawn.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.615
Oh, no, no. Don't worry.
Don't worry, kids.

00:31.698 --> 00:35.619
I'm not trying to hitch my cart
to the family mule.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.538
Oh, you.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.623
Oh, my God. Actually,
gave me some goose bumps.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.542
He's starting
a portrait business

00:41.625 --> 00:43.335
and he wants to shoot us first.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.628
Shoot me now.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.129
I just need some
beautiful photos

00:46.213 --> 00:48.131
of a beautiful family
for my ads.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.300
[flute playing]

00:53.887 --> 00:57.307
Mommy, Daddy, look what
Corey gave me to keep forever.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.184
Wow, Corey.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.811
That's gonna be
in our house now.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.980
- Yeah.
- [flute playing]

[Astrid]<i> During the first years</i>
<i>of your child's life,</i>

01:05.148 --> 01:07.109
<i>you are their everything.</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:09.361
[James]<i> Yes. But at a certain</i>
<i>point, your kids get inspired</i>

01:09.444 --> 01:12.656

<i>TV, video games,</i>

01:12.739 --> 01:14.491

[Astrid]<i> And that's it.</i>
<i>They are no longer yours.</i>

<i>But, hey, at least</i>
<i>it's a two-way street.</i>

01:18.495 --> 01:21.039
Corey said that Viv advised
him to hold his breath

01:21.123 --> 01:23.125
until I let him
try cotton candy.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.294
- Yeah.
- That is Viv. Yeah.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.921
She got a coloring book
out of Mom using that one.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.339
You weren't there.
It was scary.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.842
[flute continues playing]

01:31.925 --> 01:34.011
[James] Hey, Viv,
I bet Corey will get a big kick

01:34.094 --> 01:35.846
out of borrowing
your tambourine.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.514
[gasps] Wonderful.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.684
[theme music playing]

01:48.358 --> 01:51.361
Corey thinks
Felix seems withdrawn.

01:51.445 --> 01:55.240
I asked him if he wanted
to fly my drone and he was...

01:55.324 --> 01:57.284
- unresponsive.
- Oh, yeah.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.204
He's been a little sad since
his friend, Ab, moved away.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.955
I fell in my face while
putting on pants this morning.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.332
He barely cracked a smile.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.708
Really?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.460
It's so funny
when you hurt yourself,

02:06.543 --> 02:09.880
Felix is a quiet,
sensitive child.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.008
[deep voice] Uh-doy. Thanks, Dawn, for
explaining my firstborn to me.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.469
What should I feed him?
Dirt and feathers?

02:15.552 --> 02:18.138
Okay. You know, I'm actually
gonna check on him right now.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.557
Maybe also take a peek
at that drone, Corey.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.894
[Nisha] Terrible news.
My friend, Brenda,

02:23.977 --> 02:25.896
with the varicose veins
is in crisis.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.524
- Who?
- Brenda. Skinny head,

02:28.607 --> 02:31.235
bushy eyebrows.
She needs my emotional support.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.237
Did she overhear you
describing her?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.239
She is being sued
by her condo board.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.158
But I have so many things
to pick up for this photo shoot.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.118
Can I count on you girls
to take over?

02:40.202 --> 02:43.038
Well, sadly,
I have work and kids.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.665
And tomorrow I'm taking Corey

02:44.748 --> 02:46.124
to the botanical garden
after school.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.086
But then, yes, after,
I can get the stuff.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.672
Oh, I can always
count on you, darling.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.550
It's mostly just a tripod,
some lenses,

02:54.633 --> 02:56.593
- and a few taxidermy animals.
- What?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.720
And, oh, yeah, the theme
is maroon.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.639
And make sure
you cover the upholstery

03:00.722 --> 03:01.932
in your car with something.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.726
They may be dead but those
talons still have some fight.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.395
Thank you. Thank you.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.648
[playful music playing]

03:14.820 --> 03:17.781
Felix, why don't you eat
those uh, those happy pancakes?

03:17.865 --> 03:18.782
We gotta go.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.450
The face reminds me of Ab.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.244
He smiled like this
all the time.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.538
Yeah. I know
you miss Ab, honey.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.125
Do your--do your other
friends miss him, too?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.294
Ab was my only friend.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.671
- Ha...
- [Viv] Felix,

03:32.754 --> 03:34.423
how do you like my warts?

03:34.506 --> 03:36.091
That's funny.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.468
Viv, eat your warts.
We gotta go.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.595
- Mom?
- Yeah?

03:39.678 --> 03:41.430
Can I bring Metal Man
to school?

03:41.513 --> 03:44.057
Uh, yeah. Sure.
Of course you can, bud.

03:45.601 --> 03:46.852
[Felix] Thank you.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.397
Hey, Felix, what do you say
we skip the bus today

03:50.480 --> 03:52.399
and you ride with me to school?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.067
- Sure.
- Yeah?

03:54.151 --> 03:56.153
You, me, and Ennis,
three cool guys.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.654
If he starts telling
dating stories,

03:57.738 --> 03:58.906
we'll just remind him
that you're nine.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.366
[playful music playing]

04:07.414 --> 04:09.291
[Ennis] Oh, the sounds
of children playing.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.667
It's making my eyes water.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.044
The frequency's
too high or something.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.420
Let's get out of here.
Hey, have a good day, Felix.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.796
Just give me one second.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.632
Hey, listen to me.
I wanna tell you something.

04:16.715 --> 04:17.925
I know you're sad about Ab.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.676
You're a great kid.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.637
I know you're gonna
make new friends.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.473
But I don't know how.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.767
Just say hi.
Just start a conversation.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.185
This Metal Man is an icebreaker.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.312
Guys love talking
about action men.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.022
Including girls.
Girls are also guys.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.649
Everybody's guys.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.317
Okay. Come here.
You got this. Love you.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.277
[Felix] I love you, too.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.362
You got this, kiddo.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.364
Bye, Dad.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.786
[Ennis] Oh.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.789
Is it like that every day?
It's like he's going off to war.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.791
He's fighting
the battle of loneliness.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.584
A war that'll last
your whole life.

04:52.668 --> 04:55.504
[sighs] After I give you a lift,
I got a front row ticket

04:55.587 --> 04:57.089
to a<i> Pixar </i>movie.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.469
What are you guys talking?

05:02.553 --> 05:03.428
[James]
They look a little old, buddy.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.722
How can you tell?
They all look seven to me.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.974
Hey, why are we still here?

05:07.057 --> 05:08.767
I just wanna see how
he interacts with other kids.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.144
How much of raising your kid
is just spying on them?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.479
Ten percent.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.357
- [Ennis] What?
- Hey. Hey. Check that kid out.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.693
Be better. Not cool, bro.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.111
You know, I kind of feel like
this is what you'll be doing

05:19.194 --> 05:20.571
if you were a ghost.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.948
[James]
I'll not be haunting my son.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.449
I'd travel. I'd see the world.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.577
[scoffs]
You don't think that's worse?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.912
Lonely ghost dad
backpacking through Europe.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.456
[James] Oh, not The Buddy-Bench.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.001
- Come on.
- What is The Buddy-Bench?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.335
It's a bench.
They put kids on the bench

05:35.419 --> 05:36.879
and it means you're
supposed to play with the kids

05:36.962 --> 05:38.213
but it's actually
the kiss of death.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.132
Oh, yeah. The Buddy Bench.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.468
[James] Oh, now,
they got this momo with him.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.137
Do you believe
they put this kid with my kid?

05:45.220 --> 05:47.139
Oh, here we go.
This looks promising.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.307
[Ennis] Yeah.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.434
[James] [gasps]

05:50.517 --> 05:52.144
What?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.645
Are you serious?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.398
[Ennis] Hey. Hey, kid.
Come here. Come here.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.608
- See that boy?
- Okay.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.942
- You see that boy right there?
- Maybe don't do this.

05:59.026 --> 05:59.902
- It's not the best look.
- Huh?

05:59.985 --> 06:01.945
Hey. Back away from the fence.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.197
- Just include him.
- All right. Okay.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.740
Hey, you know, not everybody's
good at ball hockey!

06:04.823 --> 06:06.366
- Sir.
- Some lunches just smell different.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.576
- [woman] Sir.
- You're projecting, buddy.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.036
- Okay.
[James] Bye, bye, bye.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.537
- There's the whistle. Come on.
- We're going.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.789
Now, are you sure
you have maroon?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.082
I don't know. Is this maroon?

06:14.166 --> 06:15.959
- That's more of an oxblood.
- What is with the maroon?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.836
Why are we doing this?
Are we having a photo shoot

06:17.920 --> 06:19.296
- or are we in a cult?
- It's part of the vision,

06:19.379 --> 06:20.631
which means
I have to make it happen.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.300
By the way, you were right
about Felix not making friends.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.635
Oh, I recognize the signs.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.802
Because of Corey?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.387
[Dawn] What? No.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.556
Corey is the Zack Morris
of his Montessori.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.058
He's a great conversationalist

06:31.141 --> 06:33.185
and I'm actively working
on a sense of humor.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.521
Oh, you are?

06:35.604 --> 06:36.563
You are.

06:36.647 --> 06:37.689
How?

06:37.773 --> 06:39.900
By making flashcards
of<i> New Yorker </i>cartoons.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.235
He has five seconds
to capture each one.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.694
Oh, yeah.
That's how Kevin Hart did it.

06:42.778 --> 06:43.654
Who?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.156
I just wish
I could help Felix.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.282
I don't really know how

06:47.366 --> 06:49.576
'cause I felt like I had loads
of friends growing up.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.744
[Dawn] You did.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.579
And I had the pleasure
of living in your shadow.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.581
Come on. You had friends-ish.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.083
Well, mom was my friend.

06:56.166 --> 06:59.753
And I was very well liked at...

06:59.837 --> 07:01.088
the orthodontist.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.714
Well, you give a dentist
eight grand,

07:02.798 --> 07:04.341
they're not not gonna like you.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.093
[Astrid] Oh.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.136
Field hockey jersey.
Number three.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.930
Number three. Number three.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.056
Remember?

07:11.139 --> 07:14.101
I remember trying
to wash that thing. Oh.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.103
Making sure your shin pads
were in your bag.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.856
Holding you back
when you screamed at the ref.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.607
There's no maroon here.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.192
I'll just go shopping
for everyone.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.777
Okay. Oh, God.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.445
Those refs were so scared of me.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.114
It was wonderful.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.284
[upbeat music playing]

07:31.201 --> 07:32.327
Felix, did you remember

07:32.411 --> 07:33.579
to bring Metal Man
back from school?

07:33.662 --> 07:34.955
Oh, my new friend, Gus,
borrowed him.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.999
- Gus.
- You have a friend.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.709
- A friend. A new friend.
- What is he like?

07:38.792 --> 07:42.546
Well, he's a guy.
He's funny and cool.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.881
- Good.
- Love him.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.299
- Good.
- Sounds--he's both of them.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.800
He sounds really good.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.427
Why don't you--why don't you
maybe invite him

07:48.510 --> 07:49.595
over this weekend
for a play date?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.013
- Okay. I'll ask him.
- [James] Yeah.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.307
Okay. And, and, and if he says
that he can't,

07:53.390 --> 07:54.892
it's 'cause
he's got other plans.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.935
It's not 'cause of you
because you're fantastic.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.604
Be cool. Be cool.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.690
[playful music playing]

08:06.695 --> 08:09.031
Come on.
I'll show you my room.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.325
Oh, James, Gus is here.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.868
- Hey. Hi.
- I didn't hear you come in.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.369
How are you?

08:14.453 --> 08:15.329
Your parents still here?
We'd love to meet them.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.455
They had to jet.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.248
They're presidents of companies.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.000
Are you guys presidents
of anything?

08:20.667 --> 08:23.462
We're presidents
of this house. [chuckles]

08:23.545 --> 08:25.380
My dad is the president
of Adidas.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.008
- Yeah.
- The sports brand.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.344
- Okay.
- His mom is the president

08:30.427 --> 08:32.971
of the ice cream
that is three ice creams.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.890
His mom is the president
of Neapolitan ice cream.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.642
His family is very big
into stripes.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.353
- Apparently.
- Anyhoo, welcome to our home.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.854
How much is it worth?

08:40.938 --> 08:42.439
[James] The home?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.900
Yeah, I'm not sure how much
the home is worth.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.735
But you know
what is worth noting?

08:46.818 --> 08:48.195
Spaghetti for dinner.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.405
- Spaghetti's puke.
- [laughs]

08:51.365 --> 08:53.283
He always says puke.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.036
It's his word for stuff
that's dumb and bad.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.872
I can see how
that's a good joke.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.667
[flute playing]

09:01.750 --> 09:03.085
Recorders are for babies.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.962
Yeah. They're for babies.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.715
Spaghetti is not puke.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.093
[upbeat music playing]

09:11.176 --> 09:13.053
Okay.
So, you have your maroon shirt.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.513
Now, I have to go see
a man named Chet

09:14.596 --> 09:16.640
about more dramatic taxidermy,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.934
unless you can swing
by<i> en route </i>to the park.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.103
Our car is kind of full
without a fox corpse.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.229
Can you do it?

09:22.312 --> 09:23.689
- No problem.
- [James] Heads up.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.065
Gus has asked if we have

09:25.148 --> 09:26.775
parental controls
on our internet.

09:26.859 --> 09:29.528
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, how's Felix's new friend?

09:29.611 --> 09:31.029
He told me I was cute
and then asked how big

09:31.113 --> 09:32.447
the diamond was on my ring.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.032
He's precocious.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.909
He told me that Felix
gave him Metal Man,

09:35.993 --> 09:37.744
which, uh, is impossible,

09:37.828 --> 09:40.038
but he's got Felix wrapped
around his little puke finger.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.456
Oh.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.750
Could I cut my shirt
like Felix's?

09:43.834 --> 09:46.461
What do you mean like Felix's?
Felix, get down here.

09:46.545 --> 09:47.796
[kids laughing]

09:49.715 --> 09:51.216
- [James] Hey.
- Felix, what did you do

09:51.300 --> 09:52.759
- to your shirt?
- Oh, me and Gus

09:52.843 --> 09:54.845
made it a tank top.
I wear tank tops now.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.555
That was for the photo shoot.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.265
Oh, I didn't know.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.933
No, no. It's fine sweetie.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.519
Just another stop along the way.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.188
I'll go do that now.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.272
Dawn.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.276
Felix wants me to sleep over.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.444
Ooh.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.362
James.

10:12.446 --> 10:16.033
He looked so sad yesterday.
Now, look at him.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.038
- You have to ask your parents.
- I already did.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.831
- Puke-arama.
- Puke-arama.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.459
- [groans] Pounding.
- Oh, I hate it.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.421
[Astrid] So, Gus' dad seemed
pretty enthusiastic

10:29.505 --> 10:31.381
when I called to confirm
the sleepover.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.510
Apparently, Gus already had
his PJs packed in his backpack.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.053
Convenient, no?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.554
What are you suggesting
that Gus' family

10:37.638 --> 10:39.056
is running some sort
of sleepover grift?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.474
Oh, I think they made
dinner reservations

10:40.557 --> 10:42.184
before they even
dropped him off.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.937
He's mean and he
taught me how to do this.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.438
Stop. No, don't do that.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.524
[James] Listen, honey,
just don't hang out

10:48.607 --> 10:50.234
with Felix's friend anymore
and work on your recorder case,

10:50.317 --> 10:51.818
okay? Okay.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.492
Ab was so sweet with his
"pweese" and his "thank you."

10:58.575 --> 11:00.744
Boys are just jerks
when they're together sometimes.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.081
Um, do you think
that I saddled Dawn

11:04.164 --> 11:05.499
with too much work
for this photo shoot?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.501
I feel like she's done
like everything.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.919
What do you mean?
Didn't she offer?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.256
As much as I'd love
to stay and help you

11:12.339 --> 11:14.341
with that absolute troll,

11:14.424 --> 11:17.344
I really feel like
I should go give her a hand.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.180
- [Gus] Oh, yeah.
- [kids laughing]

11:20.264 --> 11:21.849
Go.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.851
Remember the sacrifice
I made for you here today.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.228
Don't tell me what to do.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.606
[upbeat music playing]

11:29.690 --> 11:30.941
I love you.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.693
Thank you.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.949
Okay. I get it.
You're mad at me

11:39.032 --> 11:41.076
because I left you
to do all the shopping.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.411
I'm not mad.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.371
Well, you're making me
carry these.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.957
Well, Chet said to keep
them out of the sun.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.043
We couldn't just
leave them in the car.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.795
Look, Felix didn't have a friend

11:51.879 --> 11:53.422
and then he had too much friend,

11:53.505 --> 11:55.132
and Viv had a school assignment,
and Andrew was...

11:55.215 --> 11:56.800
Yeah. Of course. You're busy.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.511
You do what you gotta do
and I do the rest.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.430
That's always been our deal.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.390
Always is a little much, no?

12:03.473 --> 12:05.851
I mean, it's just one dumb
to-do list for Mom.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.270
After her divorce,
who helped Mom with the cleaning,

12:08.353 --> 12:10.105
the laundry, the house repairs?

12:10.189 --> 12:12.774
Oh, my God, Dawn.
I fixed the bathroom door that one time.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.193
It's fine. You were younger.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.652
Mom needed help,
so that was my job.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.655
It wasn't your job, all right?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.782
You just held us together
like an awkward

12:20.866 --> 12:23.035
teen butler
because you're amazing.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.786
And I, I don't think
I appreciated it then

12:24.870 --> 12:26.371
but I see it now.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.291
Look, the color scheme is stupid
and you've done enough.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.959
So, I'm gonna call Mom and
I'll just tell her to forget it.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.753
Good luck.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.338
[line ringing]

12:34.421 --> 12:36.215
Hello? Nisha here.

12:36.298 --> 12:37.549
[Astrid]<i> Cute.</i>

12:37.633 --> 12:38.967
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.302
It's Graham. Here you go.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.387
- [Nisha]<i> Hello?</i>
- Should I call back later?

12:42.471 --> 12:43.722
[Nisha]<i> Oh, no, Beta.</i>

12:43.805 --> 12:45.682
He's gonna be here all night.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.434
[growls, barks]

12:47.518 --> 12:49.102
- Oh, my God.
- [Nisha]<i> Oh, stop.</i>

12:49.186 --> 12:50.812
<i>We're having</i>
<i>a wonderful time together.</i>

12:50.896 --> 12:52.856
Hey, listen, I'm gonna go
check that wasp nest.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.566
You can talk.
I think it's getting bigger

12:54.650 --> 12:56.693
and I don't want
my cinnamon bun getting stung.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.780
No. I don't want my little
cream puff getting stung.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.657
- [Graham] Nasty.
- I think Graham's finding it

13:01.740 --> 13:03.075
awkward to get in
with the family.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.952
- Yeah.
We're all feeling that way.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.246
[Nisha]<i> I know he seems</i>
<i>like a big, tough, muscular guy</i>

13:07.329 --> 13:10.290
and he is, but he's also
a very muscular artist

13:10.374 --> 13:11.667
that I picked up.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.002
Well, that's great.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.838
<i>He's a lucky guy. Okay.</i>

13:15.921 --> 13:17.714
So, why maroon?

13:17.798 --> 13:19.550
Oh, you remember
that maroon quilt

13:19.633 --> 13:20.926
that I used to wrap
you girls up in?

13:21.009 --> 13:22.135
<i>Well, I think of that blanket</i>

13:22.219 --> 13:23.846
<i>whenever I think</i>
<i>of my love for my family.</i>

13:23.929 --> 13:26.431
I'm grateful my girls
are helping me with this.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.475
Yeah. Of course, Mom. Yes.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.310
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- [Nisha]<i> Okay. Bye.</i>

13:30.394 --> 13:33.814
[Dawn] Ah! What do you think?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.607
Does it come in maroon?

13:36.608 --> 13:37.901
I'm still buying it.

13:38.902 --> 13:39.736
[James] Felix!

13:39.820 --> 13:41.822
[kids laughing]

13:45.117 --> 13:46.118
Can I help you?

13:46.201 --> 13:48.078
May I speak with Felix, please?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.705
I'll see if he's in.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.836
Gus says you wanted to see me.

13:55.919 --> 13:59.256
- Yeah.
- Is there a problem, gentlemen?

14:05.888 --> 14:07.598
Did you put Viv's
recorder in the toilet?

14:07.681 --> 14:08.557
Just for a second.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.392
It doesn't matter
how many seconds.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.977
We're starting a prank show.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.770
Viv will get paid
when it blows up.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.397
Okay. Be honest with me.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.733
Is Gus pressuring you
to act like him?

14:17.816 --> 14:19.401
Just wink or nod

14:19.484 --> 14:21.570
or do nothing and I will find
a reason to send him home.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.697
No. He's staying.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.116
He's gonna show me
how to make fireworks.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.914
- [Gus] Okay. Let's do this.
- [Felix] Let's do this.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.917
[kids laughing]

14:39.129 --> 14:40.756
Tomorrow's gonna be
a nightmare.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.634
- I'm already grumpy.
- It's already tomorrow.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.803
[door opens]

14:46.887 --> 14:50.140
- What's the Wi-Fi password?
[All] Go to bed!

14:50.224 --> 14:51.975
Go to bed!

14:53.727 --> 14:54.603
[door closes]

14:54.686 --> 14:57.689
[playful music playing]

14:59.858 --> 15:02.569
[James] I think I got maybe
an hour of sleep last night.

15:02.653 --> 15:03.570
[Astrid] We can do this.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.364
- I believe in us.
- Uh-huh.

15:05.447 --> 15:08.033
Yup, yup, yup. All we have to do
is let light reflect

15:08.116 --> 15:10.911
off our bodies into a camera
and we'll be good.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.246
Are you awake enough to drive?

15:12.329 --> 15:13.413
I'll be fine
once we get there.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.832
Okay. I'll see you out there.
Hey, Felix, let's go.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.501
Time to get ready.
Get some clothes on, buddy.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.585
What?

15:18.669 --> 15:20.212
What'd you do?

15:20.295 --> 15:21.880
It wasn't us.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.050
Felix, go wash that off.
We don't have time for this.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.718
We tried already.

15:26.802 --> 15:28.428
What, what do you--
this is permanent marker?

15:29.263 --> 15:30.931
Gus thinks a ghost did it.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.933
I felt an energy last night.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.310
Do you feel an energy
right now, my dude?

15:35.394 --> 15:36.979
He's not lying.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.523
- Yes. He's lying.
- He's lying.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.567
- He's a liar, man.
- This guy's a liar.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.527
He's been lying ever since
he stepped foot in this house.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.988
His parents are not presidents
of multinationals.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.656
- No.
- Nor does his aunt

15:47.739 --> 15:50.450
own the fastest bridge
in the world.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.952
- Think, Felix, think--
- That's not--how is--

15:52.035 --> 15:53.412
That's not even a thing.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.830
Does that make--just break
that down for one second.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.248
You--put it
in the works, man.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.541
He can't harness the wind.

15:57.624 --> 15:58.917
- He's never been shot.
- Yet.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.377
You did not give him
your Metal Man,

16:00.460 --> 16:01.837
even though
he said that you did.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.714
Felix, he did it.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.299
- He did it.
- He did it.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.425
You're wrong.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.093
I did give it to him.

16:08.844 --> 16:12.097
Felix is my only friend. [sobs]

16:12.181 --> 16:14.099
Why are you doing this?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.728
Why are you making him cry?

16:21.315 --> 16:24.234
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.611
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.154
I know. I know. I feel awful.

16:27.237 --> 16:28.405
- I know.
- [Astrid] But he's a monster.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.199
He did do that to the face.

16:30.782 --> 16:31.700
[whistles]

16:31.783 --> 16:33.452
Whoa, whoa. What was that?

16:33.535 --> 16:34.453
Show us your hands.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.127
What?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.465
- Everybody makes mistakes.
- Mm.

16:47.132 --> 16:50.469
Today, Daddy and I
were wrong to accuse Gus,

16:50.552 --> 16:52.304
even if all the signs
in the world

16:52.387 --> 16:53.972
pointed to him
being the culprit.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.600
We owe Gus a big apology.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.815
Viv, what were you trying
to write on Gus' face?

17:03.899 --> 17:05.067
A hex.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.485
Where did you learn
about hexes?

17:06.568 --> 17:07.611
The radio.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.987
What station?

17:09.071 --> 17:11.406
- I'm still sad, you know?
- [James] Yes.

17:11.490 --> 17:14.409
- Right.
- Gus, we are very,

17:14.493 --> 17:16.036
very, very sorry.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.622
Apology accepted... not!

17:19.748 --> 17:22.960
I can't believe you guys
wrecked my only friend.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.503
Okay. Gus. Gus, look at me.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.546
We are so sorry,

17:25.629 --> 17:27.548
and as a token of our regret,
what can we offer you?

Perfect.

- You've been graffitied.
- Oh, relax, Mom.

17:59.830 --> 18:03.458
We're simply paying the price
for misjudging Felix's friend, Gus,

18:03.542 --> 18:05.752
who is excellent.

[James] His parents
are letting him stay

He's marooned, Mom.

his humor and wit, please?

You're a riot, my love.

You know, I was hoping
you would make an effort

18:26.857 --> 18:28.859
from my sake to make
Graham feel welcome,

18:28.942 --> 18:30.736

was too much to ask.
