Today, Yorkville is one of
the ritziest neighbourhoods

16:58.166 --> 16:59.667
in the world.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.200
But back in the 60s,
it was a hippie hot spot.

17:02.333 --> 17:04.200
People came from around
the world

17:04.333 --> 17:06.000
to hit the Yorkville scene.

17:06.133 --> 17:09.066
This is where it all happened.
Bars, nightclubs,

17:09.200 --> 17:12.000
Neil Young, Joni Mitchell,
Leonard Cohen.

17:12.133 --> 17:14.400
John Lennon had his first
concert

17:14.533 --> 17:16.000
when he left the Beatles.

17:16.133 --> 17:18.367
Hippie culture, alive and well.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.467
This was a happening spot.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.433
There it is. Capris Club.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.867
89 Avenue Road.
I knew it.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.300
Narrator: Ted's research
confirms the existence

17:28.433 --> 17:30.500
of a club in the basement
of the hotel.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.233
- These old clubs would've been
literally buried

17:33.367 --> 17:35.033
during redevelopment.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.000
And somehow, I'm gonna take
a look down there

17:37.133 --> 17:38.767
and see if I can find
something.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.233
If there is cool salvage
down there, I want it.

17:45.900 --> 17:48.867
Narrator: Ted has posted the
salvage from Hotel 89 online

17:49.000 --> 17:51.700
and the big dining table
draws immediate interest.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.800
- So here it is.
See the big one right there?

17:53.934 --> 17:56.000
- Wow.
- Is it ever cool, eh?

17:56.133 --> 17:58.567
- So nice.
- We salvaged this wood,

17:58.700 --> 18:01.066
sold it to a guy,
who sold it to an artist,

18:01.200 --> 18:03.066
who made this table on
commission

18:03.200 --> 18:04.767
for a hotel.
- Wow.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.200
- A lot of other demolition
companies

18:06.333 --> 18:08.367
would've just crunched
that wood up

18:08.500 --> 18:11.133
and thrown it in the garbage.
We don't do that here.

18:11.266 --> 18:13.400
We saved it,
it became a table,

18:13.533 --> 18:15.200
and now it gets to carry on.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.467
So it's the circle of salvage.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.967
- Beautiful. I love the whole
story behind it.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.066
We want kind of a showpiece
or something,

18:23.200 --> 18:24.834
like big at home

18:24.967 --> 18:26.300
and I think it's gonna be
perfect.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.700
How much is this?
- We're at $2,750,

18:28.834 --> 18:30.633
which is very good
for this table.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.400
- $2,750?
- Yeah.

18:32.533 --> 18:33.934
- Okay.
- 'Cause they probably paid

18:34.066 --> 18:36.166
$5,000 to $6,000
to get that made.

18:36.300 --> 18:39.633
- I don't know, I'd have to
kind of see it in full though.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.467
- That's, there it is, in full.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.834
- No, like I mean, pull it out.
(Laughs)

18:43.967 --> 18:46.600
- Okay, I'll get a couple
of guys help me bring it out

18:46.734 --> 18:48.333
and then you can make
your decision.

18:48.467 --> 18:50.533
- Okay. I came because I'm
the negotiator in the family

18:50.667 --> 18:52.166
and I can be pretty tough.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.934
So we'll see how that works
with Ted.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.800
Pretty amazing that
it's been put together

18:55.934 --> 18:57.333
without screws and nails.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.300
- Oh yeah, watch your fingers.

18:59.433 --> 19:02.033
- There you go. Perfect.
So do you like it?

19:02.166 --> 19:04.100
- Yeah, I love it.
Yeah, it's beautiful.

19:04.233 --> 19:06.433
So you said $1,750, right?
- Oh, no, no, no.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.467
- No?
- $2,750.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.367
- Whoa... 'kay.
- $2,750.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.867
- Okay. I don't know,
I think I'd do $2,500

19:14.000 --> 19:15.867
delivered and installed.
Like set up.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.400
- Oh. (Laughs)

19:17.533 --> 19:19.900
No, I would, like $2,750,
that's got to be our price.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.000
We can't wiggle that much
on this one.

19:22.133 --> 19:24.400
- So $2,750 delivered--

19:24.533 --> 19:26.200
- Can we get the truck
right to where it's going?

19:26.333 --> 19:28.133
- Pretty close, yeah.
Just bring it all,

19:28.266 --> 19:30.266
bring it right in there.
- 'Cause that's 1,200 pounds.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.467
- Yeah, but you have guys
that work here.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.233
- We are the guys.
- We are the guys.

19:34.367 --> 19:36.900
- Yeah, exactly. So...
- $2,750.

19:37.033 --> 19:38.834
- $2,750 delivered, set up?

19:43.500 --> 19:45.600
- (Slow chuckle) Yeah,
all right,

19:45.734 --> 19:47.700

- Perfect.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.367

You don't have time

There's no manual, it's old,
it's broken. I can't.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.133

a mechanic, even part time.

I got this customer, Ron,
he keeps coming around,

Ted is determined to find
evidence of a nightclub

20:57.567 --> 20:59.400

is destroyed.

20:59.533 --> 21:01.200
- Are you Matt?
- I am. How are you?

21:01.333 --> 21:03.500
Narrator: He's hired a ground
penetrating radar technician,

21:03.633 --> 21:06.000
whose equipment can detect
any hidden structures

21:06.133 --> 21:07.433
that may exist underground.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.433
- Like there should be
something down here.

21:09.567 --> 21:11.066
- Well, we can scan this
whole area.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.734
We'd have to do multiple lines,

21:12.867 --> 21:14.734
see if there's something
under this parking lot.

21:14.867 --> 21:16.667
So that'll send a signal
through the asphalt

21:16.800 --> 21:18.500
into the soil
and if there's something there,

21:18.633 --> 21:20.066
we'll get a bounce back
of the signal.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.867
And if there's nothing there,
we won't get a bounce back.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.066
All right, let's find it.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.834
Are you optimistic, Ted?

21:26.967 --> 21:29.066
- I'm always optimistic.
(Radar beeps)

21:30.233 --> 21:32.533
While Matt's scanning it,
I'm getting hopeful.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.066
I'm seeing stuff,
evidence of walls.

21:36.233 --> 21:38.433
Anything tying it to being
a club -

21:38.567 --> 21:41.734
set lists, signs, memorabilia,
instruments.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.200
If there's great stuff
from the 60s down there,

21:44.333 --> 21:46.533
I need to find it.
- Oh.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.734

Narrator: Ted and Justin are
using ground penetrating radar

22:03.367 --> 22:05.900
to look for signs of
an old underground nightclub.

Justin: Uh, that could be
a foundation wall, right?

in the dirt,

22:17.400 --> 22:19.233

Matt: We saw a wall there.
If there were a void there,

22:28.900 --> 22:31.767
we would see a big reading
on the screen. So.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.967
Let's go across here and we'll
see if there's a void,

22:34.100 --> 22:35.600
if this is actually a room
or not.

22:35.734 --> 22:37.367

penetrating radar

22:37.500 --> 22:39.467

parallel

to the rear of the hotel

metres further away.

22:43.233 --> 22:46.033
Ted is hoping to reveal
evidence of an entire nightclub

22:46.166 --> 22:48.166

22:48.300 --> 22:50.133
Matt: See how the data's really
consistent there?

22:50.266 --> 22:53.266
That's telling me that the soil
is the same through this area.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.700
Justin: So there's no void?
Matt: No.

22:54.834 --> 22:56.233
- These walls are probably
still down there.

22:56.367 --> 22:58.000
- That was a wall there,
but that doesn't mean

22:58.133 --> 22:59.967
that they didn't backfill
everything else around it...

23:00.166 --> 23:01.900
- Yeah.
- To make it a parking lot.

23:02.033 --> 23:04.100
- Well, ultimately,
there's no voids there,

23:04.233 --> 23:05.633
it's been backfilled.

in, no problem.

money,

these are his needs.

I kind of thought initially.

a grand for this thing.

25:21.700 --> 25:24.567
This generator, a 150 kilowatt,
that's a lot of power.

25:24.700 --> 25:27.367
So that can be used
for a backup generator,

25:27.500 --> 25:29.200
a large hospital,
small factory.

25:29.333 --> 25:31.300
I've fixed generators
like this before,

25:31.433 --> 25:34.000
but nothing this old.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.667
Oh, we've got a leak.
It's not good.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.567
Justin: I think this
is a great test for Ron.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.633
These generators, these older
ones that are hard

25:40.767 --> 25:42.467
to get running, every time
we go to a job site--

25:42.600 --> 25:44.100
Fuel for you -
this is what we get.

25:44.233 --> 25:45.667
So if Ron gets this going,

25:47.133 --> 25:48.567
he's a keeper.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.433
You have your fuel,
you have a charger,

25:50.567 --> 25:52.333
you have your three in one.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.200
- Wish me luck, bro.
- Good luck. Good luck.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.233
Narrator: Justin leaves Ron
to work on the generator

25:56.367 --> 25:58.567
and joins Ted
as they head back downtown

25:58.700 --> 26:00.767
to check out a new job.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.367
Ted: We got an eight-storey
building, midtown Toronto.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.166
Very current. In my mind,
this is a new building.

26:06.300 --> 26:09.200
Not my cup of tea,
but our bread and butter.

26:10.233 --> 26:11.767
Hey, Devon,
how're you doing, buddy?

26:11.900 --> 26:13.900
- Hey, how're you guys doing?
- This building's almost new.

26:14.033 --> 26:15.767
- Yeah, it's only about 40
years old.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.500
- Well, that's almost new
to me.

26:17.633 --> 26:19.633
- A 115,000 square foot,
nine-storey building

26:19.767 --> 26:22.200
and we're taking the building
right from the top,

26:22.333 --> 26:24.333
all the way to the ground.
Condo gonna be going up here.

26:25.834 --> 26:29.300
Narrator: 2161 Yonge Street,
like Hotel 89,

26:29.433 --> 26:31.867
was built during the long
mid-20th century period

26:32.000 --> 26:33.834
when modern architects
all over the world

26:33.967 --> 26:35.700
were embracing
the possibilities

26:35.834 --> 26:37.500
of concrete construction.

26:37.633 --> 26:39.900
Reinforced concrete buildings
ranged from boxy

26:40.033 --> 26:42.734
and utilitarian
to space age futurism.

26:42.867 --> 26:45.400
Already, many of the buildings
from that era

26:45.533 --> 26:47.100
have been demolished.

26:47.233 --> 26:49.300
- What do you expect to find
here, if it's so new?

26:49.433 --> 26:51.066
- Good mechanical.
- Yeah.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.700
- Gonna be current, right?

26:52.834 --> 26:54.300
- Mechanical, electrical would
probably be current.

26:54.433 --> 26:55.900
Elevators are pretty new;
that's something

26:56.033 --> 26:57.633
that we just scrap usually
anyways.

26:57.767 --> 26:59.633
- I've been trying to sell
elevator stuff for years.

26:59.767 --> 27:01.834
We keep scrapping everything.
Not the cars,

27:01.967 --> 27:03.600
just the controls and motors.

27:03.734 --> 27:04.900
- Well, how-how are we gonna do
that?

27:05.033 --> 27:06.700
- You got a crane coming?
- We got a crane coming.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.633
- We'll just - shhh-wooh -
lift them up, bring 'em down.

27:08.767 --> 27:10.133
- We can crane them down,

27:10.266 --> 27:12.133
I don't know if it's in our
budget, I don't know if that's,

27:12.266 --> 27:13.900
you know, something that you
guys really wanna take on.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.900
- You gotta open the roof
above them,

27:16.033 --> 27:17.367
you have to disconnect
everything,

27:17.500 --> 27:18.667
you have to crane them out.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.233
- Let's just see how much
we can get.

27:21.367 --> 27:22.800
It may be worth it.

27:22.934 --> 27:25.800
A few months ago, I found
a buyer for elevator motors,

27:25.934 --> 27:28.367
then it took months to find
the right building.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.467
I finally found it,
I'm gonna sell these.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.000
My elevator guy, Jeff's, gonna
be here in a couple hours,

27:34.133 --> 27:35.967
so let's just blitz through
the building first,

27:36.100 --> 27:38.033
and when he gets here,
we'll figure it out, all right?

27:38.166 --> 27:39.600

some dentists offices here,

there were corporate offices,
insurance companies.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.567
There's gonna be stuff here.

- Look at this.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.200
These are nice cupboards, eh?

28:04.333 --> 28:05.767

I needed a kettle.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.967
- There you go.
- (Laughing)

28:08.100 --> 28:09.967
- These chairs, we should grab.
They're a nice set.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.100
- I'll bring the other one out.
- There's more here!

28:12.233 --> 28:14.367
- Probably 20 in the whole
building.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.033
- Yeah, we'll grab them all.
These ones here,

28:16.166 --> 28:19.533
I think I can get $200 bucks
apiece. They're nice.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.667
Justin: There's a lot of stairs

28:22.800 --> 28:24.300

- It's a dentist office.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.166

don't know what any of this is,

28:57.967 --> 29:00.233
some nice elevators here.
Jeff: We're always buying

29:00.367 --> 29:01.834
surplus elevator gear.
We're one of the few shops

29:01.967 --> 29:03.967
that can repair them,
get them back up and going

29:04.100 --> 29:06.834
and these motors will last
another 50 to 90 years

29:06.967 --> 29:08.734
if treated properly.

29:08.867 --> 29:10.100
Ted: People think about
elevators,

29:10.233 --> 29:12.433
they're thinking about the car
that you step into.

29:12.567 --> 29:16.166
What I'm selling are the parts
that make that elevator work.

29:16.300 --> 29:19.300
The motors and controllers
are at the top of the building.

29:19.433 --> 29:21.734
We're also keeping these
elevator parts

29:21.867 --> 29:24.033
out of the scrap pile.

29:24.166 --> 29:26.033
- Beautiful.

Look at 'em,
they're nice, aren't they?

29:27.767 --> 29:29.633

look like they're worth money?

29:29.767 --> 29:32.567
- I think... there's gonna be
some money here for you.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.166
Ted: 'Kay, so what,
what would this cost

29:34.300 --> 29:36.133
for all of this new,
these three elevators?

29:36.266 --> 29:37.734
Like $100 grand?

29:37.867 --> 29:41.033
- These machines, yeah,
probably $100 grand, new.

29:42.233 --> 29:44.400
- So you think like $50 grand?

29:44.533 --> 29:46.700
- Yeah, no, not from me.
- No?

29:46.834 --> 29:48.266
- Not from me, no.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.467
I'll give you $1,000 bucks
a unit.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.900
A thousand for the motors,
a $1,000 for the controllers.

29:53.033 --> 29:55.400
- That's $6K. We got...
- Six K for the whole thing.

29:55.533 --> 29:57.467
- Like I'm thinking like
twelve grand would be nice.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.934
- Yeah, I don't know. Uh...

30:00.066 --> 30:02.400
- It's five grand for us
to get these down on the ground

30:02.533 --> 30:04.300
onto your truck.
- At least.

30:04.433 --> 30:05.900
- At least five grand.

30:06.033 --> 30:08.233
Like look, we gotta rip this
off, punch through there.

30:08.367 --> 30:09.967
- We gotta put a hammer
on the roof.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.500
- Lift these outta here,
get the crane to lift 'em down,

30:12.633 --> 30:14.033
load them on your truck.

30:14.166 --> 30:17.033
I think $10 grand for all
of it would be great.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.166
- All right, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.967
$10 grand, let's get her done.
- Yeah?

30:21.100 --> 30:23.100
- All right.
- Good stuff.
- Good job.

30:23.233 --> 30:25.700
- We're gonna do a lot of
business in the future,
all right?

30:25.834 --> 30:27.433
- All right. I'm ready for it.
Bring it on.

30:27.567 --> 30:28.967
To get this unit out clean,

30:29.100 --> 30:31.633
actually popping it off
the floor won't be a big deal.

30:31.767 --> 30:33.166
The work getting it up
through that roof,

30:33.300 --> 30:34.834
that's gonna be the tricky
part. It'll be fun,

30:34.967 --> 30:36.767
but that's why I get the
experts at Priestly

30:36.900 --> 30:38.834
to deal with that.
- Do you need that box

30:38.967 --> 30:40.967
or is that an extra $5 grand?
All: (Laughing)

30:41.100 --> 30:43.166
- Oh, you're killing me now.
- But you want the box?

30:43.300 --> 30:45.166
- I remember hearing $10 grand
for the whole thing.

30:45.300 --> 30:48.233
- All right, okay, fine.
- Take it all. Come on, let's
go.

30:48.367 --> 30:50.166
Ted: I know I'm sticking
my neck out here,

30:50.300 --> 30:52.166
it's gonna cost a few grand
to get these down,

30:52.300 --> 30:54.166
but if I can open up this side
of this business,

30:54.300 --> 30:57.700
it could be millions
of dollars.

The proximity of the

electrical components

34:04.934 --> 34:06.633

34:06.767 --> 34:08.333
- If our starter is any good,

34:08.467 --> 34:10.800
that should do the trick.

34:10.934 --> 34:13.000
I got me some power,

34:13.133 --> 34:15.066
so I'm just gonna make sure...

34:41.467 --> 34:43.200
to get the generator
to turn over,

34:43.333 --> 34:45.033

Justin arrives with one
of Priestly's machines

34:46.767 --> 34:48.467

34:48.600 --> 34:50.500
- What do you think of that?
- Now we're cooking.

34:50.633 --> 34:52.233
- Now you got some power, unh?

34:52.367 --> 34:54.233
- One on the red and one
on the black for me, please.

34:54.367 --> 34:56.166
- Okay.

34:57.867 --> 35:00.066

from the machine...

Now that we have this end
figured out...

35:09.400 --> 35:11.166
we're gonna make sure
our fuel is okay.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.100
- Yep. Okay. Let's keep going.
- I know.

35:13.233 --> 35:14.967

Justin.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.266

35:16.400 --> 35:18.266
we're gonna give it
a few pumps.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.700
Narrator: This generator has
had fuel sitting in it for
years.

35:20.834 --> 35:22.867
- We have to get all this dead
fuel out of the system.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.033
- You know what? This looks
like a nice stout ale.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.633

35:32.166 --> 35:33.600
Look for the fuel, right?
- Yeah.

Narrator: Once the old fuel is
flushed out of the system,

35:35.934 --> 35:37.867
Ron needs to test
if the generator

35:38.000 --> 35:40.333
is pumping new diesel fuel
through its engine.

(Stuttering)
- Nothing.

Narrator: It's demolition day
at 2161 Yonge Street,

36:05.433 --> 36:07.967
so it's all hands on deck.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.033
Devon: So what's unique
about this project

36:10.166 --> 36:13.400
is it's an unbonded
post-tension building.

36:13.533 --> 36:15.300
Narrator: This type
of construction

36:15.433 --> 36:17.934
uses a network of steel cables
set inside concrete slabs

36:18.066 --> 36:20.033
to maintain the building's
integrity.

36:20.166 --> 36:21.867
This technique
is much stronger

36:22.000 --> 36:23.700
than traditional reinforced
concrete,

36:23.834 --> 36:25.834
but when it's time for
the building to come down,

36:25.967 --> 36:27.867
the cables have to be cut
individually

36:28.000 --> 36:29.400
before they can wreck,

36:29.533 --> 36:31.266
releasing a huge amount
of pressure

36:31.400 --> 36:33.033
into the surrounding concrete.

36:33.166 --> 36:35.467
- This is a very complicated
demolition.

Narrator: Devon's team has been
preparing for this moment

36:37.667 --> 36:39.266

36:41.200 --> 36:42.700
our first set of cables
up here on the roof.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.467
This is my first experience

36:44.600 --> 36:46.266
dealing with a building
like this.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.600
These cables essentially act
as rebar;

36:47.734 --> 36:49.400
they tie the entire building
together.

36:49.533 --> 36:51.400
Once we cut these cables,

36:51.533 --> 36:53.667
there's essentially nothing
tying this slab together.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.500
Narrator: The staggering
amount of pressure

36:55.633 --> 36:57.133
being held by these cables

36:57.266 --> 36:59.400
will be released into
the concrete as they are cut.

36:59.533 --> 37:01.467
Priestly has to take
every precaution

37:01.600 --> 37:04.266
to ensure that debris is not
launched onto the streets

37:04.400 --> 37:05.734
beneath the building.

37:05.867 --> 37:07.767
- They're under so much tension
that, when they discharge,

37:07.900 --> 37:09.600
they shoot out
almost like a shotgun,

37:09.734 --> 37:11.533
which is why we have set up
so much protection,

37:11.667 --> 37:13.600
just to make sure that none
of that debris goes anywhere

37:13.734 --> 37:15.333
except where it's supposed
to go.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.533
We have pedestrians walking
down below,

37:16.667 --> 37:18.233
we have cars driving down
below,

Devon's crew has the elevator
motors ready.

As soon as the buyer arrives,
the machinery is hoisted

38:26.333 --> 38:28.200
up above the busy city streets

38:28.333 --> 38:30.266
and straight onto
their truck below.

38:36.667 --> 38:39.266
Each of these elevator motors

on working for decades.

refinished it,

41:07.200 --> 41:08.967
popped the glass back in.

I really thought it would
look great

41:23.500 --> 41:25.433
on the wall in my cottage.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.967
But now when I see this
in person, I think,

41:28.100 --> 41:30.767
well, that would be an awesome
headboard for my spare room.

41:38.467 --> 41:39.867
You didn't have it
on the listing.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.767
- Well, because we just wanted
to let people look at it first.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.767
If you put a price on,
sometimes it scares them away.

visualize what they're
gonna do with it.

- $800 is kind of
out of my budget.

42:08.633 --> 42:11.567
Would you do $650?
- Like, no.

42:11.700 --> 42:12.834
I can't go that low.
- Yeah.

42:12.967 --> 42:14.900
- Like I say, we put a lot
of time into this.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.734
Originally, I was gonna replace
the centre piece

42:17.867 --> 42:19.567

So I can do $750.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.066
That's my best price.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.834
Nothing lower than that.

You're the first person

- And that's what I'm scared
about,

42:34.633 --> 42:37.266
that I'm gonna miss out on
a piece like this. Hmm.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.800
- These one-off pieces,
you gotta grab it when you can.

42:40.967 --> 42:42.700
- Hmm...

42:44.967 --> 42:46.600
Okay. Okay.
- Deal?

42:46.734 --> 42:48.066
- Deal.
- All right. Excellent.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.367
I'm glad you got it 'cause you
appreciate it, I can tell.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.500
- I definitely appreciate it,
that's for sure.

42:52.633 --> 42:53.967
- Let's go in the caboose
and write up.

42:54.100 --> 42:55.700
- Okay, cool.

42:55.834 --> 42:56.967
Ted: Very happy that
it's going to someone

42:57.100 --> 42:59.166
that will love it
and cherish it.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.867
It's yours.
Kind of sad to see it go.

43:02.900 --> 43:04.767
(Excavator rumbles)

43:08.033 --> 43:09.767
- Hey, guys.
- Guess what?

43:09.900 --> 43:11.033
- What?
- Just guess.

43:11.166 --> 43:12.900
- Hey, Ron.
- Guess what he did?

43:13.033 --> 43:14.767
- You got it going?
- There was something...

43:14.900 --> 43:16.467
- Sure did!
- Stopping the fuel flow.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.367
- So now it's nine grand.
- Just went up.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.200
- You wanna stick around
with us, Ron?

43:20.333 --> 43:22.300
- Well, it depends.
What're you offering me?

43:22.433 --> 43:23.900
- Have a seat,
we'll talk turkey.

43:24.033 --> 43:25.900
Thanks, Justin.
- See you, man.

43:26.033 --> 43:29.333
- Well... I made Ron an offer
and he accepted it.

43:29.467 --> 43:32.000
The team is getting bigger
and better.

43:34.033 --> 43:36.567
(Truck rumbles)

43:36.700 --> 43:38.200
Narrator: Things are settling
in nicely

43:38.333 --> 43:39.767
at the Priestly salvage yard.

43:39.900 --> 43:42.433
- Ready? Here we go, guys.
Okay, boys, lift her up!

43:42.567 --> 43:44.100
Narrator: At the end of another
successful week,

43:44.233 --> 43:46.367
the team gathers to celebrate
the raising

43:46.500 --> 43:47.900
of the yard's new sign.

43:48.033 --> 43:49.900
All: Hey! Woo!
Ted: There we go.

43:50.033 --> 43:52.233
One step closer.
Justin: Good job, guys!

43:52.367 --> 43:54.500
Brandon: Now it's official.
Ted: It's official.

43:54.633 --> 43:56.367
You can see that
from the highway, man.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.667
- That looks great.
- All right, let's go to work

43:58.800 --> 44:00.233
and pay for this stuff, eh?
- All right.

44:00.367 --> 44:01.867
(Ron chuckles)

44:02.000 --> 44:04.066
- It does look pretty good, uh?
- It does look good up there.
