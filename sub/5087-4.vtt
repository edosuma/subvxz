WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:10.933
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:11.033 --> 00:12.333
But is it any good?

00:12.433 --> 00:14.200
I'm a reviewer,
but I don't review

00:14.300 --> 00:15.933
food, books, or movies.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.900
I review life itself.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.500
[screams]

00:20.600 --> 00:21.700
[triumphant music]

00:21.800 --> 00:24.400
[parrot squawks]

00:24.500 --> 00:26.933
*

00:27.033 --> 00:28.167
Over here.

00:28.267 --> 00:32.200
*

00:33.833 --> 00:36.000
Welcome to Review.
Hello to you all.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.100
And please, say "hello"
to A.J. Gibbs.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.400
Hi, Forrest.
You look ready for a review.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.667
And you look ready
to proffer one to me.

00:42.767 --> 00:44.367
Ew.

00:44.467 --> 00:47.167
Theo from Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma.

00:47.267 --> 00:49.333
- Hmm.
- Hi, Forrest.

00:49.433 --> 00:50.733
I've recently saved up
enough money

00:50.833 --> 00:53.000
to open up my own
CrossFit gym.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.833
So what's it like to be
a cult leader?

00:55.933 --> 00:59.400
What's it like
to be a cult leader? Eek.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.933
I think you'd be good
at that, Forrest.

01:01.067 --> 01:02.633
I think you'd get a lot
of followers.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.133
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04.233 --> 01:07.233
Huh, well would you
like to join my cult?

01:07.333 --> 01:11.067
No.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.367
Okay.

01:13.467 --> 01:15.233
All right.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.333
(Forrest)
Oh, there's old Chuck Manson.

01:17.433 --> 01:19.067
Always nice to see him.

01:19.167 --> 01:22.667
I really don't understand
how these things work.

01:22.767 --> 01:24.633
It's really very simple.

01:24.733 --> 01:26.333
You find some
vulnerable people,

01:26.433 --> 01:29.067
you isolate them,
you exploit them for money,

01:29.133 --> 01:32.067
so on and so forth.
Rivers of blood.

01:32.167 --> 01:34.133
Rivers of blood?
Good Lord.

01:34.233 --> 01:37.533
Trust me, I have seen every
cult documentary ever made.

01:37.633 --> 01:41.300
(Forrest voice-over)
Lucille's dire assessment of
cults was certainly overblown,

01:41.400 --> 01:43.400
but I did worry
about the possible impact

01:43.500 --> 01:45.967
that this review could have
on my family life.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.667
My girlfriend,
Mrs. Greenfield,

01:47.767 --> 01:49.967
and I were happily
living together with my father

01:50.067 --> 01:51.500
in his timeshare cottage,

01:51.600 --> 01:54.133
an arrangement made necessary
after a fire

01:54.233 --> 01:56.133
had tragically
destroyed his home.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.733
It's such a lovely home
that you have here.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.333
- It is.
- Uh-huh.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.200
If we can just keep
Forrest out of the kitchen,

02:01.300 --> 02:02.433
we'll be fine.

02:02.533 --> 02:05.867
Oh, I see. Oh.
[laughs]

02:05.967 --> 02:07.900
I get it, I get it,
I get it.

02:08.067 --> 02:10.600
I burned down our other
house, cooking a meal.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.367
Yeah. Yeah.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.867
I feel like a walk.
Okay.

02:15.967 --> 02:17.067
(Forrest voice-over)
That night, as Mrs. Greenfield
and I

02:17.100 --> 02:18.800
expressed our growing love,

02:18.900 --> 02:21.967
I puzzled over a message
to base my cult on.

02:22.067 --> 02:24.100
And I found it in the stars.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.067
Do you see those five stars
up there

02:26.100 --> 02:28.100
in the shape of a letter M?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.833
That's Cassiopeia.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.800
Yeah, that's shaped like a W.

02:31.900 --> 02:35.200
No, it's an M,
like MacNeil.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.333
I feel like those stars
are shining right at us.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.867
It's making me feel like...

02:39.967 --> 02:43.800
we can lead
a five-star life.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.533
Wow, that's really--
that's big stuff.

02:46.633 --> 02:49.700
(Forrest voice-over)
And, just like that,
I had my first follower.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.367
But a good cult
needs more than two people.

02:52.467 --> 02:53.800
We're out here today just
talking to people

02:53.900 --> 02:55.800
about leading a five-star life.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.433
(Forrest voice-over)
I set out in search
of lost, sad people.

02:58.533 --> 03:01.067
You can lead a five-star life.
It's possible.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.167
(Forrest voice-over)
And several of them
were willing to be found.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.667
Guys, I think we're really
on the first steps

03:05.767 --> 03:08.867
of an exciting and important
journey of self-discovery.

03:08.967 --> 03:11.400
(Forrest voice-over)
In truth, there wasn't much
to my message,

03:11.500 --> 03:12.800
but there didn't need to be.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.433
* One star is better
than half *

03:16.533 --> 03:20.133
* Two stars better than one
* One star's better than half

03:20.233 --> 03:21.800
(Forrest voice-over)
I had offered a sense
of belonging,

03:21.900 --> 03:23.100
and that was enough.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.233
*

03:25.333 --> 03:27.667
(Forrest voice-over)
This cult was a purely fun
and positive experience.

03:27.767 --> 03:29.500
And over the next couple
of weeks,

03:29.600 --> 03:31.833
we attracted more and more
followers.

03:31.933 --> 03:33.233
I trust you, you trust me.

03:33.333 --> 03:36.300
One, two, three, four, five--
ah!

03:36.400 --> 03:38.600
[laughs]

03:38.700 --> 03:40.567
(Forrest)
What a great feeling!

03:40.667 --> 03:42.500
What do you say, Dad?
That's pretty cool, right?

03:42.600 --> 03:43.633
(Forrest)
Yeah, you can put me down.

03:43.733 --> 03:45.600
These are great, aren't they?

03:45.700 --> 03:47.500
(Forrest voice-over)
As the days passed
and my little community

03:47.600 --> 03:49.900
came to feel
more and more like a family,

03:50.067 --> 03:52.800
I decided our utopia
was missing someone.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.067
Hey, Dad.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.233
I have a really
exciting idea, okay?

03:56.333 --> 03:57.800
You seem pretty
lonely in here,

03:57.900 --> 04:00.333
and something pretty
exciting is going on

04:00.433 --> 04:02.400
just across the road
over there.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.067
Uh...

04:04.133 --> 04:08.333
Dad, don't you want
to lead a five-star life?

04:08.433 --> 04:12.433
Yeah, um...I am worried.

04:12.533 --> 04:16.433
You know, worried
is not the right word.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.600
I'm wondering...

04:19.700 --> 04:21.533
slash worried
that this might turn out

04:21.633 --> 04:27.067
like the model-airplane
club sophomore year.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.200
This isn't gonna be
anything like that, Dad.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.367
For one thing, my followers
love me out there.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.733
(Forrest voice-over)
It was a low blow for my father
to bring up

04:34.833 --> 04:37.767
my disastrous leadership
of Model Airplane Club.

04:37.867 --> 04:39.767
Now I was determined
to prove to him

04:39.867 --> 04:42.567
that I could lead a cult
as well as anyone.

04:45.333 --> 04:46.867
I began following the wisdom

04:46.967 --> 04:50.067
of cult leaders
who had succeeded before me.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.600
First, I granted myself
the extraordinary power

04:52.700 --> 04:55.467
of absolving the sins
of my followers.

04:55.567 --> 04:58.067
Who else has a burden
to unleash?

04:58.133 --> 05:00.600
I stole money from
the pension fund at work.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.933
The stars absolve you!

05:03.067 --> 05:05.867
(all)
One, two, three, four, five!

05:05.967 --> 05:08.633
I cheated on my husband
with a total stranger.

05:08.733 --> 05:10.933
The stars definitely
absolve you.

05:11.067 --> 05:14.100
(all)
One, two, three, four, five!

05:14.200 --> 05:15.733
I hit a homeless man
with my car,

05:15.833 --> 05:17.233
and I just kept driving.

05:17.333 --> 05:20.433
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I did.

05:20.533 --> 05:23.067
The stars absolve you!

05:23.100 --> 05:25.933
(all)
One, two, three, four, five!

05:26.067 --> 05:28.500
My children,
I have taken your sins

05:28.600 --> 05:30.667
and transgressions
and crimes,

05:30.767 --> 05:32.567
and I have banished
them into the deep,

05:32.667 --> 05:34.267
dark void of space.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.067
- We are free!
- [cheers and applause]

05:37.100 --> 05:40.600
(Forrest voice-over)
Then, to keep everyone focused
on me and being more like me,

05:40.700 --> 05:42.400
I instituted a new uniform.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.433
- Here.
- We have a new uniform!

05:44.533 --> 05:45.767
(Forrest voice-over)
And a reward system.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.667
As you earn each level,

05:47.767 --> 05:49.733
you will get a new piece
of clothing.

05:49.833 --> 05:52.367
The first level
of achievement is shirts.

05:52.467 --> 05:54.200
Th second level is pants.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.167
Let's hope you get
to that one soon.

05:56.267 --> 06:00.167
The third level is jacket.
The fourth level is tie.

06:00.267 --> 06:04.567
And level five--the glasses
of enhanced sight.

06:04.667 --> 06:06.500
(Forrest voice-over)
And it was all working
beautifully.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.667
(Forrest)
Congratulations.
You've attained Shirt Level.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.300
(Forrest voice-over)
Two months into our time
together,

06:10.400 --> 06:12.500
the members
of my rapidly growing family

06:12.600 --> 06:15.133
were beginning
to treat me like a messiah.

06:15.233 --> 06:16.533
[applause]

06:16.633 --> 06:18.333
And I liked being a messiah.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.633
Cosmic Father, this is all
I have in the world,

06:20.733 --> 06:23.133
made out to you
in a cashier's check.

06:23.233 --> 06:25.067
- Congratulations.
- Yes, indeed.

06:25.100 --> 06:28.200
Cosmic Father,
it's my father's old watch.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.667
You're my father now.

06:29.767 --> 06:33.067
- One, two three--
(all) Four, five.

06:33.133 --> 06:34.800
Rachel?

06:34.900 --> 06:37.200
You haven't surrendered
your assets to the movement yet.

06:37.300 --> 06:40.167
I just don't think I can,
Cosmic Father.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.867
Well, I would hate
for anyone to find out

06:41.967 --> 06:45.633
about the man that you
hit with your car.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.367
A cashier's check
will be just fine.

06:47.467 --> 06:50.267
(all)
One, two, three, four, five.

06:54.167 --> 06:55.733
(Forrest voice-over)
As time progressed,
my leadership of the cult

06:55.833 --> 06:58.800
was going well--far better
than Model Airplane Club,

06:58.900 --> 07:00.600
even on its best days.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.900
The Universe has brought
us an H3T Hummer.

07:04.067 --> 07:07.267
It's got a 5.3 liter V8 engine,
so it really hauls ass.

07:07.367 --> 07:09.800
And it's ours!
[laughs]

07:09.900 --> 07:11.200
I will keep the keys.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.933
- One, two, three--
(all) Four, five.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.733
(Forrest voice-over)
And yet, there were problems.

07:16.833 --> 07:20.067
There are a few followers
who are thinking about leaving.

07:20.133 --> 07:22.367
What?
Thinking about leaving?

07:22.467 --> 07:24.200
(Mrs. Greenfield)
Yes, they've been speaking
about it amongst themselves,

07:24.300 --> 07:26.200
- and they confided in me--
- How shall we punish them?

07:26.300 --> 07:28.200
No, no, no, no.
We need to engage them

07:28.300 --> 07:30.100
and help them move forward.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.767
It might be easier
to punish them.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.233
Perhaps we could dig a ditch.

07:33.333 --> 07:35.067
- Okay, well--
- Do you have a better idea?

07:35.133 --> 07:36.967
Maybe a special project.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.400
That's what I did
when I had

07:38.500 --> 07:40.633
special needs children
in my classes.

07:40.733 --> 07:43.700
I will ruminate
on special projects

07:43.800 --> 07:46.100
to engage the followers.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.367
(Forrest voice-over)
My beautiful Mrs. Greenfield

07:47.467 --> 07:49.467
had provided me with
wise counsel.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.167
We needed a new goal.

07:51.267 --> 07:55.200
This is why, my friends,
we must build a great space ark

07:55.300 --> 07:58.167
to conduct us into the stars!

07:58.267 --> 08:00.100
- A space ark?
- A space ark!

08:00.200 --> 08:01.733
Yes, indeed, my friends!

08:01.833 --> 08:04.600
It may take years to build it,
but when it is complete

08:04.700 --> 08:07.167
we shall leave
this dying planet

08:07.267 --> 08:10.700
and we shall make
the stars our destination!

08:10.800 --> 08:13.767
Ha ha ha!
Yes, yes!

08:13.867 --> 08:15.500
- Mrs. Greenfield.
- Yes?

08:15.600 --> 08:17.067
Why don't you
head up this project?

08:17.167 --> 08:18.700
Will you organize it
and do all the work?

08:18.800 --> 08:20.267
Absolutely.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.400
(Forrest voice-over)
This idea was obviously absurd,

08:22.500 --> 08:24.333
but busy people
are happy people.

08:24.433 --> 08:25.600
Let's gather together.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.200
Does anyone know how
to get to space?

08:27.300 --> 08:28.767
(Forrest voice-over)
And Mrs. Greenfield,

08:28.867 --> 08:31.267
who had left her job
as a teacher to be with me--

08:31.367 --> 08:33.167
Was truly in her element.

08:33.267 --> 08:35.367
But my difficulties
were not all behind me.

08:35.467 --> 08:36.933
I'm really energized now.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.333
(Forrest voice-over)
It has been said that power

08:38.433 --> 08:40.067
is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

08:40.167 --> 08:43.400
Many of my female followers
would need more than a space ark

08:43.500 --> 08:45.333
to keep them invested
in my movement.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.333
Yes, my child.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.500
(Forrest voice-over)
I am not proud of what
I had to do next.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.667
Being a cult leader
had clearly gone to my head.

08:52.767 --> 08:56.400
You're welcome, Devon.
It was my pleasure.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.567
Sorry, I'm not really sure
how to feel about this,

08:59.667 --> 09:02.533
- Cosmic Father.
- Feel about what?

09:02.633 --> 09:05.400
You fellating
so many other women.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.067
(Forrest voice-over)
I encouraged Mrs. Greenfield
to channel any feelings

09:08.100 --> 09:09.567
of jealousy into
the special project

09:09.667 --> 09:11.067
that I had entrusted her with.

09:11.167 --> 09:12.967
I'm making a real sacrifice
here, you know?

09:13.067 --> 09:14.800
These girls would leave if I
didn't show them some attention.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.067
- Uh-huh.
- Try to put yourself

09:16.100 --> 09:18.367
in my place, okay?

09:18.467 --> 09:21.167
I will, Cosmic Father.

09:21.267 --> 09:24.467
(Forrest voice-over)
This was, in retrospect,
a colossal mistake,

09:24.567 --> 09:26.867
as I learned one week later.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.867
[gun shots]
- Whoo!

09:28.967 --> 09:30.633
[gun shots]
- Hey, hey, hey!

09:30.733 --> 09:33.333
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

09:33.433 --> 09:34.500
What is happening right now?

09:34.600 --> 09:36.133
[gun shot]
- Whoo!

09:36.233 --> 09:38.833
This ATM will help
us finance the space ark, huh?

09:38.933 --> 09:40.533
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.633
Hey, hey, Mrs. Greenfield,
where did you get that gun?

09:42.733 --> 09:44.067
I got it at Walmart.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.833
[gun shots]
- Oh, God--no!

09:45.933 --> 09:47.400
- Whoo!
- Absolutely not!

09:47.500 --> 09:49.367
Absolutely no guns!
I forbid it.

09:49.467 --> 09:51.667
- No, you can't do that.
- What do you mean?

09:51.767 --> 09:54.500
Well, you're fifth level
and, as you can see,

09:54.600 --> 09:55.800
I am sixth level.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.733
- This is my movement--
- Not anymore.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.400
What do you mean,
"not anymore?"

09:59.500 --> 10:01.467
- Well, I'm above you.
- There is no sixth level!

10:01.567 --> 10:03.233
You can't
go higher than six.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.333
There's five levels!
Come on, guys.

10:06.433 --> 10:07.400
Hey, let's get a bonfire going,
and we'll do some dancing.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.967
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.500
She's sixth level,
and you're fifth level.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.700
Holy [bleep], she's--
she's right.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.467
- Six is better than five.
- Six is greater than five.

10:16.567 --> 10:17.667
- One, two, three--

10:17.767 --> 10:20.000
all: Four, five, six!

10:20.100 --> 10:23.033
Come on.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.733
- I think you should go.
- No. No, no.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.900
- You are outcast.
(Rachel) Outcast!

10:28.000 --> 10:29.467
No. I--I get that you're
kicking me out of the cult,

10:29.567 --> 10:30.467
but are you
and I still gonna be?

10:30.567 --> 10:32.033
No. No!

10:32.133 --> 10:33.633
- Outcast.
all: Outcast!

10:33.733 --> 10:35.633
- Make way for the outcast.
all: Outcast!

10:35.733 --> 10:36.833
- No!
- I have a gun.

10:36.933 --> 10:39.067
all:
Outcast! Outcast!

10:39.167 --> 10:40.800
- Begone!
all: Outcast!

10:40.900 --> 10:42.967
I was gonna
get a volleyball net!

10:43.067 --> 10:44.367
all: Outcast!
- That's a good idea.

10:44.467 --> 10:45.800
We're gonna
get a volleyball net.

10:45.900 --> 10:48.067
- I love that.
- One, two, three, four...

10:48.167 --> 10:50.400
(Forrest voice-over)
I am happy to say that
Lucille's predictions

10:50.500 --> 10:52.700
of bloodshed
did not come to pass,

10:52.800 --> 10:55.767
but the emotional trauma
of losing my new family

10:55.867 --> 10:58.367
and my girlfriend
was pretty bad.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.667
I had forgotten
the first rule of leadership--

11:00.767 --> 11:03.500
know when
and where to delegate.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.767
I had also forgotten
the first rule of cults--

11:06.867 --> 11:08.533
never delegate.

11:08.633 --> 11:12.533
- Just like Model Airplane Club?
- Yeah.

11:15.733 --> 11:17.433
It was uplifting to briefly

11:17.533 --> 11:19.933
feel like I was making
a difference in people's lives.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.867
Giving them a purpose
and a space ark

11:21.967 --> 11:23.300
they didn't have before,

11:23.400 --> 11:24.967
but it hurt to have that joy

11:25.067 --> 11:26.967
ripped out of my hands
and by a woman

11:27.067 --> 11:29.633
I loved and trusted,
no less.

11:29.733 --> 11:31.533
Perhaps the real lesson
here is that

11:31.633 --> 11:34.100
not all who are lost
should be found.

11:34.200 --> 11:38.300
Being a cult leader,
two stars.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.767
One, two.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.800
- I guess that's it.
- Yup.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.433
[triumphant music]

11:50.533 --> 11:53.767
It's time for a new review.
A.J., what'll it be?

11:53.867 --> 11:55.600
It's from @kickitorlickit.

11:55.700 --> 11:58.100
What's it like to have
a perfect body?

11:58.200 --> 12:02.067
#review #question
#iwouldhitthat.

12:02.167 --> 12:03.900
Well, I--I
think I understand

12:04.067 --> 12:05.233
the first part of that,
anyway.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.200
What's it like to have
a perfect body?

12:08.300 --> 12:11.100
As a reminder,
Forrest is allowed to veto

12:11.200 --> 12:13.500
two reviews this season.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.633
[triumphant music]

12:16.733 --> 12:18.433
Yes, that is true,

12:18.533 --> 12:20.067
but this is not going
to be one of them.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.333
I see what you're saying,
and I take it

12:21.433 --> 12:22.767
as a personal challenge.

12:22.867 --> 12:26.333
I am off to achieve
physical perfection.

12:26.433 --> 12:28.233
[laughs]

12:28.333 --> 12:29.767
(Forrest, voice-over)
The perfect body--

12:29.867 --> 12:32.133
this was surely
a subjective judgement,

12:32.233 --> 12:35.267
but by any standard,
I did not have one.

12:35.367 --> 12:37.733
Oh, hi, Grant.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.600
Hi, Forrest.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.067
I thought the door
was locked.

12:46.167 --> 12:48.167
Nope.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.767
(Forrest, voice-over)
I started by joining
a spiffy downtown gym,

12:52.867 --> 12:54.767
but I did not like
working out.

12:54.867 --> 12:56.633
It was boring, and it hurt.

12:56.733 --> 12:59.067
Plus, being surrounded
by all those mirrors

12:59.100 --> 13:01.800
made me focus
on my many flaws.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.400
Look at these teeth.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.500
Do you see what I see?

13:07.600 --> 13:11.100
(Forrest, voice-over)
A simple dental prosthetic
took care of that problem,

13:11.200 --> 13:15.200
but it wasn't long
before I found another one.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.700
My teeth
were now perfectly white,

13:17.800 --> 13:20.633
but my skin was too white.

13:22.233 --> 13:25.800
Fortunately, tanning salons
are easy to find.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.800
My journey to perfection
was well under way.

13:32.067 --> 13:34.733
But the cult that was living
on my dad's timeshare property

13:34.833 --> 13:37.933
had gotten into the habit of
playing drums around a bonfire

13:38.067 --> 13:39.433
late into the night,

13:39.533 --> 13:41.800
and it was interfering
with my beauty sleep.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.367
What the [bleep]
is going on here?

13:44.467 --> 13:45.733
Stay right where you are,
Outcast.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.100
We will not be moved!

13:47.200 --> 13:48.767
- Yeah, that's fine--
- One, two-

13:48.867 --> 13:50.633
all:
Three, four, five, six!

13:50.733 --> 13:52.567
Okay, that's fine.
That's fine.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.267
I'm just really stopping by
to ask if you could please keep

13:54.367 --> 13:56.067
it down a little bit at night?

13:56.167 --> 13:58.133
You know, with the drumming?
You could be a little quieter.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.133
What happened to your face?

14:00.233 --> 14:02.633
Oh, I'm trying
to have the perfect body.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.800
Uh, well, that's not
what it looks like.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.667
It looks like
you're an orange beaver.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.767
Oh, Mrs. Greenfield.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.933
Let's not play
these little games.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.767
Okay,
remove the non-believer.

14:12.867 --> 14:14.100
- I want him off the property!
- All right!

14:14.200 --> 14:15.733
- All right, all right.
- Get him!

14:15.833 --> 14:17.267
(Forrest, voice-over)
My rapidly improving appearance

14:17.367 --> 14:19.700
was clearly making
Mrs. Greenfield jealous,

14:19.800 --> 14:22.067
and that gave me
all the encouragement

14:22.100 --> 14:23.100
I needed to keep going.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.500
all:
Four, five, six!

14:24.600 --> 14:27.433
One, two, three.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.533
(Forrest, voice-over)
Being perfect from the neck up

14:29.633 --> 14:31.267
didn't make it
any less of a nuisance

14:31.367 --> 14:33.233
to become perfect
from the neck down.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.300
I knew there had
to be an easier way.

14:37.767 --> 14:41.233
We just lay the implant
in under the skin--

14:41.333 --> 14:42.533
instant six pack.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.900
Can I do it with
other muscles, too?

14:44.067 --> 14:45.767
Like, with my arms
and my legs?

14:45.867 --> 14:47.867
Why not?
And listen to this--

14:47.967 --> 14:49.867
I'm having a special
on phalloplasty this month.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.367
Really?
What is that?

14:52.467 --> 14:57.200
That means I can give you
a really big penis.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.767
How big
are we talking about?

14:58.867 --> 15:00.233
(Forrest, voice-over)
Dr. Pirbal seemed to have

15:00.333 --> 15:02.067
a magical shortcut
to perfection.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.933
I opted to get
the full package.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.433
Thanks to 40 pounds
of silicone muscle implants,

15:09.533 --> 15:11.233
and my new gigantic penis...
- Wow.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.967
I was now a walking
work of art.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.667
And others were taking notice.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.067
Hello, Forrest.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.567
Jesus [bleep] Christ.

15:19.667 --> 15:22.967
Hey. What do you say?
Pretty good, right?

15:23.067 --> 15:28.300
Well, it's, uh--

15:28.400 --> 15:29.567
the penis is all right.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.067
I like what
you did with that.

15:31.167 --> 15:33.333
Thank you.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.067
You look good,

15:35.100 --> 15:37.133
but we're not looking
for a good body.

15:37.233 --> 15:39.067
We're looking
for a perfect body.

15:39.167 --> 15:41.367
A perfect body
means symmetry.

15:41.467 --> 15:43.400
You've got
a long way to go.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.300
(Forrest, voice-over)
Grant had a point.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.733
My penis did turn out well.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.333
I thought I was done.

15:50.433 --> 15:51.867
(Forrest, voice-over)
But making my body perfect

15:51.967 --> 15:57.400
would require more work.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.067
(Forrest, voice-over)
My new implants certainly
made me

15:59.100 --> 16:01.333
appear to be in better shape,
but the added weight

16:01.433 --> 16:02.667
of these artificial muscles

16:02.767 --> 16:05.533
made exercise
extremely challenging.

16:05.633 --> 16:08.167
I needed help,
and I found it in the form

16:08.267 --> 16:11.167
of highly illegal
steroid injections.

16:11.267 --> 16:12.800
[growls]

16:12.900 --> 16:14.067
(Forrest, voice-over)
After a few weeks of dosing,

16:14.133 --> 16:16.067
I was noticeably stronger.

16:16.133 --> 16:19.633
I was also consumed
with rage all of the time.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.733
Hey, I want that.

16:21.833 --> 16:24.067
I want that one, too!

16:24.167 --> 16:26.533
Yeah!

16:26.633 --> 16:30.467
I wanted it and I took it!

16:30.567 --> 16:33.500
Dad, I put my protein shake
down someplace,

16:33.600 --> 16:35.167
and now I can't find it!

16:35.267 --> 16:37.800
Listen, I'm sorry,
but I told your friends

16:37.900 --> 16:39.733
that they were making a little
too much noise--

16:39.833 --> 16:41.467
Those aren't my friends
anymore, Dad.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.400
I don't need friends.
I'm perfect.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.067
They just drummed louder,
you know?

16:46.167 --> 16:49.433
So I--I called the police
to file a noise complaint.

16:49.533 --> 16:50.533
The police?

16:50.633 --> 16:51.933
Dad, the police
are weaklings.

16:52.067 --> 16:53.367
They can't do anything.

16:53.467 --> 16:54.867
Watch this.

16:54.967 --> 16:57.433
[growls]

16:57.533 --> 17:00.867
I have already told
you to be quiet!

17:00.967 --> 17:03.600
(Forrest, voice-over)
Artificially elevated levels
of testosterone

17:03.700 --> 17:05.967
may be useful for short-term
muscle gain,

17:06.067 --> 17:08.267
but not for
conflict resolution.

17:08.367 --> 17:12.367
[yells]
This is ending now!

17:12.467 --> 17:14.067
One, two,
three, four, five, six.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.767
Evict the outcast!
Evict him.

17:16.867 --> 17:20.133
I have achieved perfection
in body and mind!

17:20.233 --> 17:23.700
- I am the ultimate man!
all: Five, six.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.433
I will destroy everything
you have built,

17:26.533 --> 17:29.133
starting with this
stupid tambourines!

17:29.233 --> 17:31.533
- And the these stupid drums!
- Hey! Hey! Not the bongos.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.367
This flag used to stand
for something beautiful!

17:34.467 --> 17:37.667
I want you
off my dad's property!

17:37.767 --> 17:40.767
Would you please just stop?
Stop this!

17:40.867 --> 17:42.900
(Forrest, voice-over)
As I rampaged against
my ex-girlfriend

17:43.067 --> 17:44.833
and her heavily armed
followers,

17:44.933 --> 17:46.433
the police my dad
called arrived on the scene.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.700
Drop it now!
Drop it!

17:48.800 --> 17:51.867
(Forrest, voice-over)
They were joined by members
of the FBI cult squad.

17:51.967 --> 17:55.267
As they pulled out their guns
on Mrs. Greenfield's militia,

17:55.367 --> 17:58.500
I pulled out the last weapon
I had at my disposal.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.800
Look upon my works
and despair!

18:02.900 --> 18:05.400
- Oh--Oh, God!
- Put down the weapon!

18:05.500 --> 18:08.100
Oh God, oh God,
oh God.

18:08.200 --> 18:12.100
(Forrest, voice-over)
I do not know who fired first,
or how the horrible chaos began.

18:12.200 --> 18:16.467
But clearly, I had to get
out of there--and fast.

18:16.567 --> 18:17.667
- What are you doing?
- All right, all right,

18:17.767 --> 18:21.900
all right, all right--
Oh God!

18:22.067 --> 18:26.867
- I can't find my--
- No! No! No! Ahh!

18:31.600 --> 18:37.067
Protect the space ark!
Protect the space ark!

18:37.100 --> 18:38.433
(Officer)
Drop it now! Drop it!

18:38.533 --> 18:41.667
Officer! Don't shoot
the orange Hulk!

18:41.767 --> 18:43.333
He's a good boy!

18:43.433 --> 18:46.067
Oh, God.
Oh God, oh God!

18:51.833 --> 18:54.233
(Father) He's really sweet!
- Dad!

18:54.333 --> 18:56.633
Forrest, I love you!

18:56.733 --> 18:59.767
(Officer)
Down! Drop the gun!

18:59.867 --> 19:03.067
- Dad!
- Oh!!

19:03.100 --> 19:04.867
- Dad!
- Put down the weapon!

19:04.967 --> 19:07.767
Die, monsters, die!

19:11.067 --> 19:14.900
Oh, no! God, no! Oh!
We got to get out of here.

19:15.067 --> 19:16.533
- What?
- Don't look. Don't look.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.900
- They blew up what?
- Don't look at the house.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.800
- Don't look at--why?
- Don't look at it.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.067
Ahh! No!

19:23.100 --> 19:24.900
- Not again!
- We got to go!

19:25.067 --> 19:26.633
(Forrest, voice-over)
All this time later,

19:26.733 --> 19:29.067
I'm still coming to terms
with the horror

19:29.133 --> 19:31.300
of what happened
in that field.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.667
How did my quest
for the perfect body

19:33.767 --> 19:36.900
cost so many other people
their bodies?

19:37.067 --> 19:38.467
It is, by far,

19:38.567 --> 19:39.833
the most terrible experience

19:39.933 --> 19:42.433
this show has subjected me to.

19:42.533 --> 19:44.567
As you can see,

19:44.667 --> 19:47.433
I have discarded the implants
and the fake tan

19:47.533 --> 19:50.400
that caused so much horror.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.367
I'm incredibly lucky
to be alive,

19:52.467 --> 19:54.733
and my father is also lucky
to have only been shot

19:54.833 --> 19:58.067
in the leg, and to have had
his second and final home

19:58.133 --> 19:59.367
burned to the ground.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.900
It could have been
much, much worse.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.467
Which brings me
to Mrs. Greenfield,

20:05.567 --> 20:09.100
who,
I'm very sorry to report,

20:09.200 --> 20:12.600
died in a hail
of police bullets.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.533
She came out here
to become a star,

20:15.633 --> 20:19.367
and now she
dances among them.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.867
Considering how little
time she had left,

20:21.967 --> 20:24.900
I'm grateful that
she found the courage

20:25.000 --> 20:28.300
to follow her dreams.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.467
Getting the perfect body,

20:31.567 --> 20:33.433
half a star.

20:36.567 --> 20:40.933
So you didn't even keep
your new, uh?

20:41.033 --> 20:43.100
No, I did not keep
my enormous penis,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.200
and I would
rather not say why.

20:45.300 --> 20:48.500
I think your audience
deserves to know that, Forrest.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.500
[sighs]

20:50.600 --> 20:52.700
My penis was so large

20:52.800 --> 20:54.967
that, whenever I achieved
an erection,

20:55.067 --> 20:58.467
I passed out from the lack
of blood flow to my brain.

21:00.167 --> 21:02.533
That's all the time
we have for Review.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.767
Please join us next time.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.067
All me! All me!
All me! All me!

21:16.133 --> 21:17.900
All me! All me! Help.

21:18.067 --> 21:20.067
Help. Help. Help.
Help. Help. Help.

21:20.133 --> 21:22.067
Help.
[grunts]

21:22.167 --> 21:23.867
Why the [bleep]
did you help me?

21:23.967 --> 21:24.867
- Because you--
- Why did you help me?
