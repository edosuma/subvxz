00:37.122 --> 00:41.867
* There's an angel on my left. *

00:41.868 --> 00:46.813
* But the devil's on my right. *

00:46.814 --> 00:51.791
* I've been boxing shadows. *

00:51.792 --> 00:54.799
* I tried to put up a fight. *

00:59.811 --> 01:05.224
* So, brother, will you meet me
in the middle *

01:05.224 --> 01:08.799
* so I can make it to the end? *

01:08.800 --> 01:14.178
* It's not my first
second chance, *

01:14.179 --> 01:18.923
* but, at this point,
who's counting, my friend? *

01:18.924 --> 01:27.644
* It better be
some kind of heaven. *

01:27.645 --> 01:34.270
* There better be some kind *

01:34.280 --> 01:38.200
* of carnival in the sky *

01:38.300 --> 01:42.120
* at the end of this ride. *

02:01.659 --> 02:03.290
Excuse you.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.969
Hey, excuse me.

02:05.970 --> 02:08.276
Hey, sir, you just
bumped into me.

02:10.848 --> 02:12.786
Fuckin' rude
motherfucker.

02:44.295 --> 02:49.240
* So, brother, will you meet me
in the middle *

02:49.241 --> 02:54.190
* so I can make it to the end? *

02:54.200 --> 02:57.827
* It's not my first
second chance, *

02:57.828 --> 03:03.507
* but, at this point,
who's counting, my friend? *

03:03.508 --> 03:13.640
* It better be
some kind of heaven. *

03:13.650 --> 03:19.312
* There better be some kind *

03:19.313 --> 03:23.956
* of carnival in the sky *

03:23.958 --> 03:28.468
* at the end of this ride. *

03:51.656 --> 03:54.531
Swanson,
95-G4-620.

03:54.532 --> 03:57.471
Dorothy Washington,
house manager.

03:57.472 --> 03:59.108
Come on in.

04:05.757 --> 04:06.759
Most everyone's at work,

04:06.760 --> 04:08.163
but this house
fills up real good

04:08.164 --> 04:10.101
around 7:00,
8:00 at night.

04:10.102 --> 04:11.337
<i>Your box came</i>
<i>yesterday.</i>

04:11.338 --> 04:12.740
<i>Show me your</i>
<i>release sheet,</i>

04:12.741 --> 04:15.120
<i>and then we'll</i>
<i>get you a room.</i>

04:20.625 --> 04:24.340
<i>Ladies, this here</i>
<i>is Sherry Swanson.</i>

04:24.350 --> 04:25.360
Hey.

04:25.370 --> 04:25.972
<i>Hi.</i>

04:31.887 --> 04:33.992
You got some privacy,

04:33.993 --> 04:35.762
but we don't lock
bedroom doors.

04:35.763 --> 04:37.266
This is for the locker

04:37.267 --> 04:38.369
where you store
all your valuables,

04:38.370 --> 04:39.371
in the corner, there.

04:39.372 --> 04:41.142
You get your house keys
after 30 days

04:41.143 --> 04:42.546
with no write-ups:

04:42.547 --> 04:44.820
no infractions
of our house rules,

04:44.830 --> 04:45.886
do your chores,
all that.

04:45.887 --> 04:47.724
I'm sure you'll be fine,
honey.

04:47.725 --> 04:49.161
Yeah.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.369
<i>Get the phone!</i>

05:21.405 --> 05:23.477
<i>Do you like the blue ones,</i>
<i>the green ones?</i>

05:23.478 --> 05:24.480
<i>The pink ones.</i>

05:24.481 --> 05:25.650
<i>What size are you?</i>

05:25.651 --> 05:26.652
Bobby?

05:26.653 --> 05:27.820
<i>Hello?</i>

05:27.821 --> 05:29.525
Hey, it's Sherry.

05:29.526 --> 05:31.530
<i>Sherry, is that you?</i>

05:31.531 --> 05:35.606
Yeah, what's up?

05:35.607 --> 05:39.148
<i>Listen, I got</i>
<i>to wrap it up.</i>

05:39.149 --> 05:40.150
Want a cigarette?

05:40.151 --> 05:43.425
Yeah, okay, um...

05:43.426 --> 05:45.463
that's cool.

05:45.464 --> 05:47.267
Tell everybody
I said hi.

05:47.268 --> 05:48.537
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

05:48.538 --> 05:50.174
Kiss my baby for me.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.815
Kiss Lexi for me.
Tell her I'm coming.

05:52.816 --> 05:55.554
What time are you
coming tomorrow?

05:55.555 --> 05:57.827
<i>After lunch.</i>
<i>Listen, I got to run.</i>

05:57.828 --> 06:00.980
Cool, peace.

06:00.990 --> 06:01.736
<i>Blanquita.</i>

06:01.737 --> 06:03.105
<i>Blanquita,</i>

06:03.106 --> 06:05.277
you think you're
too good for us?

06:05.278 --> 06:07.140
<i>Destiny, chill out.</i>

06:07.150 --> 06:09.454
<i>The girl just got</i>
<i>her release.</i>

06:19.478 --> 06:21.140
<i>Parole office.</i>

06:21.150 --> 06:23.220
Could I talk to PO Hernandez?

06:23.221 --> 06:24.858
<i>Who's calling?</i>

06:24.859 --> 06:26.940
Swanson.

06:26.950 --> 06:27.229
<i>Parole number?</i>

06:27.230 --> 06:29.904
95-G4-620.

06:32.141 --> 06:35.216
No crossing state lines without
permission from this office.

06:35.217 --> 06:37.220
Any change in residence

06:37.221 --> 06:38.658
must be reported
in writing.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.993
Do you understand
the conditions

06:39.994 --> 06:41.698
of your parole,
Ms. Swanson?

06:41.699 --> 06:43.202
Mm-hmm.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.582
Here's the rest
of your commissary.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.219
Count it out
in front of me.

06:50.220 --> 06:51.555
Sign the receipt.

06:51.556 --> 06:53.493
Make sure it's
all there.

07:04.921 --> 07:07.158
On each and every
reporting day,

07:07.159 --> 07:08.830
you will submit
your pay stubs

07:08.831 --> 07:09.966
along with this form.

07:09.967 --> 07:14.420
Make sure the form
is filled out correctly.

07:14.430 --> 07:16.800
Can I smoke in here?

07:16.810 --> 07:19.870
Get a job as soon
as possible.

07:19.880 --> 07:20.992
Otherwise, I have to see you
three times a week,

07:20.993 --> 07:24.434
and, frankly, I don't have
the time for that right now.

07:41.977 --> 07:45.417
Could I ask you
about something now, or...

07:47.356 --> 07:51.532
Um, this--this
curfew thing?

07:51.533 --> 07:53.303
<i>I just, um--</i>

07:53.304 --> 07:56.443
<i>I would like to spend the night</i>
<i>at my family's house,</i>

07:56.444 --> 07:57.446
<i>at my brother's house.</i>

07:57.447 --> 08:00.120
I haven't seen them
for a long time.

08:00.121 --> 08:03.494
I thought you had
no problems, Swanson.

08:03.495 --> 08:04.898
Yeah.

08:04.899 --> 08:07.537
Any unreported police contact

08:07.538 --> 08:09.709
will result in the immediate
violation of your parole,

08:09.710 --> 08:10.912
and I will violate you.

08:10.913 --> 08:12.516
You will be returned
to prison

08:12.517 --> 08:14.120
to serve the remainder
of your sentence,

08:14.121 --> 08:16.920
plus any new charges
you may incur.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.496
Monday at 9:00 a. m. ,
you report to Mr. Monroe

08:18.497 --> 08:21.437
at 1138 Clifford Street.

08:21.438 --> 08:23.208
Please give me a pass.

08:23.209 --> 08:25.881
Are you trying to fuck
with me, Swanson?

08:28.387 --> 08:31.260
Or are you here to successfully
complete your parole?

08:31.261 --> 08:34.635
To successfully complete
my parole, sir.

08:34.635 --> 08:38.277
<i>I just really--</i>

08:38.278 --> 08:40.416
I have to see my daughter.

08:44.559 --> 08:46.831
I haven't seen her
in a long time.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.100
Your brother's name
and address, what is it?

09:01.101 --> 09:02.970
Robert Swanson.

09:02.971 --> 09:05.176
<i>1334 Ridge Drive.</i>

09:05.177 --> 09:07.114
Slow down.

09:09.186 --> 09:10.221
One...

09:10.223 --> 09:13.830
334 Ridge Drive.

09:13.831 --> 09:19.430
Mountainside,
New Jersey.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.672
<i>Come on, there's nothing</i>
<i>to see here.</i>

09:31.673 --> 09:33.760
<i>Come on, keep moving.</i>
<i>Keep moving.</i>

09:33.770 --> 09:34.120
Let's go.
Let's go.

09:42.966 --> 09:43.902
Dump it.

09:51.687 --> 09:53.792
Yo, bitch, why do you--
I told you,

09:53.793 --> 09:56.632
I ain't coming
up off that rock for free.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.536
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

10:53.537 --> 10:54.604
Good luck tomorrow,
okay?

10:54.605 --> 10:55.606
<i>Thanks, Andy.</i>

10:55.607 --> 10:57.946
<i>Thanks for helping</i>
<i>me out.</i>

10:57.947 --> 10:58.948
How do you do?

10:58.949 --> 11:01.455
Hey.

11:01.456 --> 11:02.958
I'm Andy Kelly.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.529
I'm the director
of this program.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.531
Oh, hey, I'm Sherry.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.568
I just got here.

11:06.569 --> 11:07.970
Nice to meet you--
Sherry Swanson.

11:07.971 --> 11:08.973
Yeah.

11:08.974 --> 11:10.276
Right, I processed
your intake.

11:10.277 --> 11:11.278
Oh.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.849
Welcome to Genesis House.

11:12.850 --> 11:14.252
Thanks.

11:14.253 --> 11:17.590
Is that your Bible?

11:17.600 --> 11:18.729
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it is.

11:18.730 --> 11:20.300
Well, you know what
you should do?

11:20.301 --> 11:22.710
Take a look at this one.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.276
What's laid out in the first
164 pages of this book

11:24.277 --> 11:25.813
gram for life.

11:25.814 --> 11:28.180
It's a program of change
that'll spin your head around

11:28.190 --> 11:29.556
and make you happier
than you ever were

11:29.557 --> 11:30.958
when you were on drugs
and alcohol.

11:30.959 --> 11:32.610
I know all about it.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.233
I did a year of 12-step
when I was locked up.

11:34.234 --> 11:35.270
Really?

11:35.271 --> 11:40.140
I, um... I like
the Good Book better.

11:42.219 --> 11:43.155
Gotcha.

11:45.727 --> 11:47.866
Do you want some coffee?

11:47.867 --> 11:49.269
Yeah.

11:49.270 --> 11:52.243
<i>Please.</i>

12:09.317 --> 12:11.322
Oh.
Oh, stop.

12:11.323 --> 12:12.693
Stop, stop.

12:12.693 --> 12:15.833
Damn.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.838
I could go all night.

12:23.318 --> 12:24.554
Look at this.

12:27.695 --> 12:30.302
My friend shaved it.

12:30.303 --> 12:32.239
You want to kiss it?

12:33.275 --> 12:34.478
Come on, baby.

12:34.479 --> 12:35.480
Come on, kiss it.

12:35.481 --> 12:36.583
Okay.

13:02.679 --> 13:03.982
You have
a visitor.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.840
Okay.

13:29.444 --> 13:33.152
Oh, shit.

13:33.153 --> 13:35.890
Put some meat
on your bones.

13:35.900 --> 13:40.570
Yeah.

13:40.571 --> 13:42.843
I missed you.

13:42.844 --> 13:45.281
You should have
come see me.

13:48.857 --> 13:50.795
Okay, let's get
the fuck out of here.

13:54.704 --> 13:56.341
It's all pretty much the same.

13:56.342 --> 13:59.616
The only thing different
is we got a new table.

13:59.617 --> 14:05.263
Well, I guess Lynette
redecorated the living room.

14:05.264 --> 14:07.166
We got Alexis a new bed.

14:07.167 --> 14:10.375
She didn't want to get rid
of her little baby bed.

14:10.376 --> 14:14.819
But you'll see;
everything's the same.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.757
It'll be like
you never left.

14:24.174 --> 14:25.979
<i>Did you hear</i>
<i>Chris Cuzar died?</i>

14:25.980 --> 14:29.153
How am I supposed
to hear that?

14:29.154 --> 14:31.894
I don't know
who you talk to.

14:31.895 --> 14:33.631
Nobody.

14:33.632 --> 14:39.411
I don't talk
to nobody, Bob.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.918
How'd he die,
from the dope?

14:41.919 --> 14:43.354
Yep.

14:48.532 --> 14:50.504
Shit, do you have
a cigarette?

14:50.505 --> 14:52.944
Nope, I quit.

14:52.945 --> 14:54.815
Fuck you.

14:57.956 --> 14:59.660
Look at the little mermaid.

14:59.661 --> 15:01.230
Don't go too far.

15:01.231 --> 15:02.801
Come back here.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.303
Get over here.

15:06.770 --> 15:07.946
<i>Munchkin.</i>

15:07.947 --> 15:09.383
Hey, girls.

15:09.383 --> 15:10.653
Hey, hon.

15:10.654 --> 15:11.655
<i>Lynnie.</i>

15:11.656 --> 15:14.194
<i>Hi, Sherry.</i>

15:15.999 --> 15:17.602
Welcome home.

15:22.470 --> 15:23.150
Hi.

15:23.151 --> 15:25.210
<i>You're here,</i>
<i>wow.</i>

15:25.220 --> 15:26.558
Not going to hug you--
I'm wet.

15:37.150 --> 15:39.880
You remember Sherry,
Lexi?

15:42.261 --> 15:44.266
Mommy?

15:44.267 --> 15:45.904
Hi.

15:45.905 --> 15:47.700
I'm going
to clean the pool.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.900
It's dirty.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.120
Hey, baby.

15:49.130 --> 15:50.481
Oh, you want
to hug me?

15:50.482 --> 15:53.880
Yeah?

15:53.890 --> 15:54.959
Oh, baby.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.665
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

15:57.666 --> 16:03.379
Oh, Lexi,
I'm so sorry.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.584
I'm so sorry, baby.

16:09.929 --> 16:13.771
I missed you
so much.

16:28.505 --> 16:30.712
Where were you?

16:35.824 --> 16:37.270
<i>Mommy, Mommy,</i>

16:37.280 --> 16:38.290
Mommy, Mommy.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.534
Damn, girl,
you got heavy.

16:41.771 --> 16:43.408
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy.

16:43.409 --> 16:46.951
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

16:46.952 --> 16:50.492
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy.

16:50.493 --> 16:53.700
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy.

16:53.701 --> 16:56.500
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.977
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy.

16:57.978 --> 16:59.547
Don't jump on the couch,
sweetie.

16:59.548 --> 17:00.582
Sit down, baby.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.200
Let me put on
your robe.

17:03.157 --> 17:04.159
Arm.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.798
You want to see
your presents, baby?

17:06.799 --> 17:08.234
What are you doing,
silly goose?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.374
<i>Okay, look at this one.</i>

17:10.375 --> 17:13.512
Look at that.

17:13.515 --> 17:15.849
I picked that
for you.

17:15.859 --> 17:17.156
Eeee.

17:18.159 --> 17:19.328
I like that.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.165
I think that's cute.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.238
Okay, look at that.

17:23.239 --> 17:25.608
I already got
that stuff.

17:25.609 --> 17:26.846
You do?

17:26.847 --> 17:28.416
Okay, whatever.

17:28.417 --> 17:29.920
<i>A Barbie.</i>

17:29.921 --> 17:31.824
Yeah, you like Barbie?

17:31.825 --> 17:33.128
She's so pretty.

17:33.130 --> 17:34.598
You do?

17:36.803 --> 17:39.477
Oh, can I kiss her too?

17:39.478 --> 17:41.949
smooch!

17:41.950 --> 17:44.890
<i>Okay, now this present</i>
<i>is the most special one,</i>

17:44.891 --> 17:47.228
that's behind
my back.

17:47.229 --> 17:50.200
This one is from
my best friend.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.739
<i>She made it.</i>

17:51.740 --> 17:54.120
<i>She made it all</i>
<i>by herself for you.</i>

17:54.130 --> 17:56.784
Red, red, red.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.892
Ohh.

17:59.893 --> 18:00.961
I like it.

18:00.962 --> 18:02.198
You like it?

18:02.199 --> 18:04.690
Uh-huh.

18:04.700 --> 18:05.138
You do?

18:05.139 --> 18:06.408
Uh-huh.

18:06.409 --> 18:08.446
Oh, I love you,
Lexi.

18:08.447 --> 18:11.620
You want Mommy to tell you
the story now

18:11.621 --> 18:14.394
of what happened
to me?

18:14.395 --> 18:15.396
Mm-hmm.

18:15.397 --> 18:16.500
Yeah?

18:16.501 --> 18:21.844
Look, honey,
come here.

18:21.845 --> 18:24.840
I want to tell you
the truth, okay?

18:24.850 --> 18:25.860
Okay?

18:25.870 --> 18:28.861
And sometimes
it's not easy

18:28.862 --> 18:31.000
to tell the truth;
you know what I mean?

18:31.100 --> 18:32.804
Mm-hmm.

18:32.805 --> 18:36.780
I did a bad thing,
and they sent me to jail.

18:36.781 --> 18:38.752
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what that is?</i>

18:38.753 --> 18:45.569
<i>What bad thing?</i>

18:45.570 --> 18:52.686
I stole from people
to get money for drugs.

18:52.687 --> 18:54.122
Mm-hmm.

18:54.123 --> 18:55.292
Oh, baby,
come here.

18:55.293 --> 19:01.941
Oh, honey, I missed you
so, so, so, so much.

19:01.942 --> 19:05.283
I used to talk to you.

19:05.284 --> 19:06.720
Did you hear me?

19:06.721 --> 19:08.457
Mm-mm.

19:08.458 --> 19:11.130
No?

19:19.417 --> 19:21.489
Lord, please, please, please,

19:21.490 --> 19:23.860
please, please
hear my extra prayer tonight.

19:23.861 --> 19:26.266
y weaknesses
and my mistakes.

19:26.267 --> 19:28.171
Give me the strength
to take life one day at a time

19:28.172 --> 19:30.108
and take care
of my daughter again, amen.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.991
Three years in Clinton, huh?

19:50.992 --> 19:55.671
Well, there's the Del Monte
plant in Irvington,

19:55.672 --> 19:57.975
just started hiring
new people.

19:57.976 --> 20:00.415
Actually, I would like
to work with kids.

20:00.416 --> 20:01.752
Kids?

20:01.753 --> 20:05.927
Yes, I graduated the Parenting
From the Inside program,

20:05.928 --> 20:09.202
and I worked 13 months

20:09.203 --> 20:13.647
<i>in the family trailers</i>
<i>and 6 in the children's center.</i>

20:13.648 --> 20:19.260
So I'd like to work
in a Head Start

20:19.270 --> 20:20.831
or a day care
or something like that.

20:20.832 --> 20:21.866
Uh-huh.

20:21.868 --> 20:29.170
<i>Also, I have a child.</i>

20:31.557 --> 20:33.327
Swanson, you're a young,
pretty girl.

20:33.328 --> 20:34.329
If you don't want to work

20:34.330 --> 20:35.733
<i>in the factory,</i>

20:35.734 --> 20:39.542
<i>you know, maybe you could</i>
<i>wait tables, cocktail--</i>

20:39.543 --> 20:40.544
<i>oh, no, no, no, no,</i>

20:40.545 --> 20:44.186
not--not with...

20:44.187 --> 20:47.461
<i>Hmm.</i>

20:47.462 --> 20:50.635
Wait, I, um...

20:53.107 --> 20:57.840
I have some papers.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.720
This is from
the parenting program.

21:06.730 --> 21:08.244
Okay.

21:08.245 --> 21:10.784
This one is from
the children's center.

21:10.785 --> 21:11.886
Okay.

21:11.887 --> 21:13.550
And...

21:13.560 --> 21:16.196
And... and what?

21:31.634 --> 21:33.710
Nice.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.914
I'll suck your dick
if you give me the job I want.

21:56.661 --> 21:58.599
The fuck you
looking at?

22:23.357 --> 22:25.429
God, grant me the serenity

22:25.430 --> 22:31.343
to accept things
I cannot change,

22:31.344 --> 22:33.381
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

22:33.382 --> 22:36.455
Tonight Dean will be reading
the preamble.

22:36.457 --> 22:37.760
My name's Dean.

22:37.761 --> 22:39.663
I'm an alcoholic
and an addict.

22:39.664 --> 22:41.101
<i>Hi, Dean.</i>

22:41.102 --> 22:42.269
Genesis Recovery

22:42.270 --> 22:44.750
<i>is a fellowship</i>
<i>of men and women</i>

22:44.760 --> 22:45.912
o share their experience,

22:45.913 --> 22:47.349
strength, and hope
with each other,

22:47.350 --> 22:49.554
that they may solve
their common problem

22:49.555 --> 22:52.427
<i>and help others to recover</i>

22:52.428 --> 22:53.898
from alcoholism
and drug addiction.

22:53.899 --> 22:54.766
Is there anyone here tonight

22:54.767 --> 22:57.390
that feels the need
to drink or use?

22:58.576 --> 22:59.879
Go ahead, little sister.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.685
<i>Don't be shy.</i>

23:05.760 --> 23:08.465
Um, I'm Sherry.
I'm an addict.

23:08.466 --> 23:10.370
Hi, Sherry.

23:13.544 --> 23:19.159
Um, I've got
2 1/2 years clean.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.801
I got clean in prison,

23:22.802 --> 23:24.839
and...

23:24.840 --> 23:28.314
I feel like using so bad.

23:32.900 --> 23:37.336
From the age of 16 to 22,
heroin was the love of my life.

23:42.815 --> 23:44.286
I mean, I had a daughter,

23:44.287 --> 23:47.761
and I never even
took care of her,

23:47.762 --> 23:53.841
and I want
to take care of her,

23:53.842 --> 23:58.520
but I got to...

23:58.530 --> 24:01.827
stay clean,
so I'm just here

24:01.828 --> 24:04.435
to stay clean and...

24:10.882 --> 24:14.359
That's all I got.

24:20.710 --> 24:21.675
Hey, Sherry.

24:21.676 --> 24:24.916
Hey.

24:24.917 --> 24:28.458
Listen, don't worry
about your problems.

24:28.459 --> 24:31.500
I mean,
you're not alone.

24:31.501 --> 24:33.200
Like, me, I could
completely relate

24:33.300 --> 24:34.205
to what you
were saying,

24:34.206 --> 24:35.675
because I come
from a dysfunctional,

24:35.676 --> 24:37.112
alcoholic family.

24:37.113 --> 24:41.256
And drugs were part
of my entire teenage life.

24:41.257 --> 24:42.526
When I was growing up,

24:42.527 --> 24:44.831
I knew we weren't supposed
to be doing drugs,

24:44.832 --> 24:46.401
but everyone
was doing them anyway,

24:46.402 --> 24:49.708
so I just--
I just fell into that, you know?

24:49.709 --> 24:52.215
She's not hearing you,
friend.

24:52.216 --> 24:55.757
She's got too much
on her mind.

24:55.758 --> 24:59.132
Do you need
a ride home?

24:59.133 --> 25:01.370
Okay, thanks.

25:01.371 --> 25:03.740
He's right, Andy.
I'm sorry.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.814
I'll catch up with you
tomorrow.

25:21.385 --> 25:23.123
Sherry, did you ever

25:23.124 --> 25:28.302
<i>work at Tony Martino's joint,</i>
<i>the Paradise?</i>

25:28.303 --> 25:29.939
I used to cook speed

25:29.940 --> 25:32.440
in a warehouse
over at South Kearny.

25:32.450 --> 25:35.510
<i>Tony was</i>
<i>one of my partners.</i>

25:35.520 --> 25:37.890
What's your name again?

25:37.900 --> 25:38.426
Dean Walker.

25:38.427 --> 25:41.320
Dean Walker?

25:41.330 --> 25:43.872
I don't know you.

25:43.873 --> 25:48.517
Man, I was, like, 16
when I worked there, I think.

25:48.518 --> 25:50.656
<i>Tony named me Lolita.</i>

25:50.657 --> 25:53.195
That was my stage name
because I was so young, Lolita.

25:53.196 --> 25:54.932
<i>I had really long hair.</i>

25:54.933 --> 25:56.102
Yeah, I remember.

25:56.103 --> 25:57.305
<i>You do?</i>

25:57.306 --> 25:58.941
You know
they closed that place down.

25:58.943 --> 25:59.944
<i>Why,</i>

25:59.945 --> 26:01.381
too many underage girls?

26:02.385 --> 26:03.386
<i>No,</i>

26:03.387 --> 26:04.489
it all came down

26:04.490 --> 26:05.825
when Richardson
got into office.

26:05.826 --> 26:06.928
Tony lost all his juice.

26:06.929 --> 26:10.202
Where's he at, anyways?

26:10.203 --> 26:11.606
<i>Greenhaven.</i>

26:11.607 --> 26:14.446
He got busted making a big move
in the city last year.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.830
They gave him 15 to life.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.659
15 to life.

26:19.660 --> 26:22.733
Damn, that's deep.

26:22.734 --> 26:25.710
<i>He probably deserved it,</i>
<i>though, right?</i>

26:25.720 --> 26:26.207
Ugh!

26:26.208 --> 26:28.146
Do you know Richie Parks?

26:28.146 --> 26:29.349
Richie Parks.

26:29.349 --> 26:31.520
No, I don't know him.
Who's that?

26:31.530 --> 26:33.558
He's another lowlife scumbag.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.764
He's also my baby's daddy.

26:35.765 --> 26:38.571
He broke out a while ago.

26:38.572 --> 26:41.410
I don't know
if he's alive or dead.

26:41.411 --> 26:42.880
Do you have kids?

26:42.881 --> 26:43.916
Oh, yeah.

26:43.917 --> 26:45.620
I got three boys
and two girls.

26:45.621 --> 26:48.461
They all live in Oklahoma
with their mamas.

26:48.462 --> 26:49.764
Hmm.

26:49.765 --> 26:50.899
Do you take care of them?

26:50.900 --> 26:53.439
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>I do now.</i>

26:53.440 --> 26:55.311
So far away.

26:55.312 --> 26:57.883
Yeah.

27:01.826 --> 27:03.280
Okay, thanks, man.

27:03.290 --> 27:04.533
Good night, little sister.

27:04.534 --> 27:05.870
And you take care,
all right?

27:05.871 --> 27:07.540
And be careful.

27:07.541 --> 27:09.478
Bye.

27:20.371 --> 27:22.409
I love you too.

27:22.410 --> 27:25.550
All right.

27:25.551 --> 27:27.488
Okay, bye.

27:31.297 --> 27:33.000
What's up?

27:33.100 --> 27:35.340
Some fucking real-life bullshit
I had to deal with today.

27:35.341 --> 27:36.510
Are you done
with the phone?

27:36.511 --> 27:38.113
Yeah, go ahead.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.530
I forgot how it gets,
you know.

27:41.550 --> 27:44.194
Here I was,
thinking prison was the worst;

27:44.195 --> 27:45.966
this was gonna be, like,
some kind of heaven,

27:45.967 --> 27:47.402
but it ain't, you know?

27:47.403 --> 27:50.276
I heard that.

27:50.277 --> 27:53.951
That job shit
got me tight.

27:53.953 --> 27:58.362
You all right?

28:06.682 --> 28:09.870
Good looking out,
girl.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.610
Ain't no thing.

28:12.620 --> 28:14.333
What are you looking at?

28:14.334 --> 28:20.415
<i>Damn, white girl,</i>
<i>you are always on the phone.</i>

28:20.416 --> 28:23.388
¿Estás sorda?

28:23.389 --> 28:25.293
Hey, Lynette.
Hi.

28:25.294 --> 28:27.970
How are you?
It's Sherry.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.637
Is Bobby there?

28:29.638 --> 28:31.575
Don't you hear me?

28:31.576 --> 28:36.520
Ah--
hey, Bobby, what's up?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.257
It's Sherry, yeah.

28:38.258 --> 28:41.640
How you doing?

28:41.660 --> 28:43.604
Yeah?

28:43.605 --> 28:46.210
Cool. Listen, I called
to talk to Alexis, actually.

28:46.211 --> 28:47.313
Is she there?

28:47.313 --> 28:49.150
Why, you think
you're something special?

28:49.151 --> 28:50.721
What? She's sleeping?

28:50.722 --> 28:51.891
Wait.
Hold on a second.

28:51.891 --> 28:53.963
Get out of my face.

28:53.964 --> 28:55.650
Bitch.

28:55.660 --> 28:57.604
Uh...

28:57.605 --> 28:59.709
Okay, well,

28:59.710 --> 29:02.820
I'm gonna call back tomorrow,
then, early,

29:02.830 --> 29:05.221
because I really want
to talk to her, okay?

29:08.363 --> 29:11.403
Okay.

29:11.404 --> 29:13.341
Okay, Bobby.
Bye.

29:24.350 --> 29:26.474
Have you got a problem
with me?

29:26.474 --> 29:29.447
Yeah, I've got
a problem with you, bitch.

29:29.448 --> 29:30.951
You jealous of me
or something?

29:30.952 --> 29:33.356
Your mother's a bitch.

29:33.357 --> 29:35.628
Oh, my mother's a bitch?

29:35.630 --> 29:40.106
My mother's dead,
you fucking stupid crackhead.

29:40.107 --> 29:41.475
But you turned out good.

29:41.477 --> 29:43.460
Look at you.

29:43.470 --> 29:44.717
Your daddy's
a fucking baby raper.

29:44.718 --> 29:46.354
Get the--

29:46.355 --> 29:48.693
Fuck you,
you fucking cunt!

29:49.695 --> 29:50.732
I'll call the cops!

29:50.733 --> 29:52.335
Do you hear me?

29:52.336 --> 29:54.607
Fuck you,
you fucking toothless cunt!

29:54.608 --> 29:56.145
Fuck you, <i>puta!</i>

29:56.146 --> 29:57.548
Now that you've
both been fucked,

29:57.549 --> 29:58.851
you should feel better.

29:58.852 --> 30:00.540
I'm telling you, bitch,

30:00.550 --> 30:01.891
you don't fuck with me,
because I will hurt you.

30:01.892 --> 30:03.729
Go to your rooms, now,

30:03.730 --> 30:05.400
or I'm calling 911.

30:05.401 --> 30:06.435
Go.

31:16.304 --> 31:18.242
Sherry, wake up.

31:21.783 --> 31:23.154
Oh.

31:23.155 --> 31:25.910
What's going on?

31:29.335 --> 31:31.306
Sorry.

31:39.827 --> 31:41.464
Sorry to show up like this.

31:41.465 --> 31:43.569
Bob.

31:43.570 --> 31:44.638
<i>Yes, hon?</i>

31:44.639 --> 31:48.748
Your sister's here.

31:50.352 --> 31:51.755
<i>Hey.</i>

31:51.756 --> 31:53.580
<i>Hey.</i>

31:53.590 --> 31:54.429
What are you
doing here?

31:54.430 --> 31:55.731
Mommy!

31:55.732 --> 31:57.770
Hey.
Oh.

31:57.771 --> 31:59.441
<i>Hey, Lexi.</i>

31:59.442 --> 32:03.350
<i>How you doing, kiddo?</i>

32:05.388 --> 32:08.295
Why do you have
a garbage bag?

32:08.296 --> 32:09.599
<i>A garbage bag?</i>

32:09.600 --> 32:12.339
Okay, come on.

32:12.340 --> 32:14.760
Let's finish getting ready
for camp.

32:28.900 --> 32:29.345
I can't stay at that place.

32:29.346 --> 32:31.884
<i>It's like being in prison</i>
<i>all over again.</i>

32:31.885 --> 32:34.392
I know. I know.
I hear you.

32:34.393 --> 32:36.863
Mm.

32:36.864 --> 32:38.801
<i>But don't you</i>
<i>have to stay there?</i>

32:38.802 --> 32:39.938
No.

32:39.939 --> 32:41.542
<i>I can live</i>
<i>wherever I want.</i>

32:41.543 --> 32:42.611
<i>I just have a curfew.</i>

32:42.612 --> 32:44.480
You take sugar?

32:44.490 --> 32:47.456
No.

32:47.457 --> 32:49.126
Milk?

32:49.127 --> 32:51.650
No, thanks.

32:54.707 --> 32:56.377
So, Bobby,

32:56.378 --> 32:59.986
<i>I'm not asking</i>
<i>to move in here.</i>

32:59.987 --> 33:01.523
Okay?

33:01.524 --> 33:04.296
But I do need to stay here
for a little while.

33:04.297 --> 33:07.437
<i>Two weeks.</i>

33:07.438 --> 33:10.544
If I stay at that place,

33:10.545 --> 33:12.983
I'm gonna violate.

33:12.984 --> 33:14.554
I can feel it.

33:16.593 --> 33:19.633
Okay.

33:21.605 --> 33:23.509
Okay.

33:23.510 --> 33:26.650
No drugs in this house,
Sherry.

33:26.651 --> 33:28.854
You bring drugs in here,
and I'm going to call the cops.

33:28.855 --> 33:29.991
<i>Bobby,</i>

33:29.992 --> 33:33.366
how many times
do I got to tell you this?

33:33.367 --> 33:35.471
I'm clean.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.141
<i>Okay.</i>

33:37.142 --> 33:38.546
Promise?

33:38.547 --> 33:40.718
<i>Hey, my baby.</i>

33:42.287 --> 33:45.160
I'm going to camp now,
Sherry.

33:47.633 --> 33:49.572
"Sherry"?

33:52.645 --> 33:54.684
You want to give your mama
a kiss?

33:54.685 --> 33:56.489
I think you do.

33:56.490 --> 33:57.491
<i>Alexis.</i>

33:57.492 --> 33:59.270
An Eskimo kiss?

33:59.280 --> 34:00.699
<i>You're gonna be late</i>
<i>for camp.</i>

34:00.700 --> 34:02.302
<i>You remember</i>
<i>what that one is?</i>

34:02.302 --> 34:03.238
smooch!

34:04.842 --> 34:06.278
You have a good day,
baby.

34:06.279 --> 34:07.280
Mm-hm.
Okay.

34:07.281 --> 34:09.987
Bye, Alexis.

34:09.987 --> 34:11.558
Have a good day,
okay?

34:11.559 --> 34:12.592
Bye, baby.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.630
Oh, yeah,
here's your lunch.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.100
Bye, Sherry.

34:21.649 --> 34:22.984
What the fuck was that?

34:22.985 --> 34:23.987
What?

34:23.987 --> 34:26.527
She just called me Sherry.

34:26.527 --> 34:31.773
Yeah.

34:31.774 --> 34:34.449
Me and Lynette were trying
to talk to you about that

34:34.460 --> 34:36.417
<i>the last time</i>
<i>you were here.</i>

34:36.418 --> 34:38.255
You want to help me
with these boxes?

34:38.255 --> 34:39.792
<i>Yeah, babe.</i>

34:45.873 --> 34:47.900
I'll be right back.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.947
Oh, yeah,
whatever.

34:57.166 --> 35:00.107
I'm her--
I'm her fucking mother.

36:17.930 --> 36:21.837
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

36:46.863 --> 36:50.338
You want one?

36:50.339 --> 36:51.508
Sure.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.460
Thanks.

37:03.771 --> 37:07.948
You don't think these pants
are too tight, do you?

37:07.949 --> 37:09.718
Turn around.
Let me see you.

37:13.761 --> 37:16.201
No, you got a good figure.

37:16.202 --> 37:17.470
You look cute.

37:23.919 --> 37:26.626
You think Lexi's
gonna get my body?

37:26.627 --> 37:27.628
I don't know.

37:27.629 --> 37:29.967
<i>I do.</i>

37:29.968 --> 37:33.976
That girl is going to be
tall and skinny.

37:33.978 --> 37:37.451
Watch.

37:37.452 --> 37:39.356
I'm gonna look out
for her.

37:42.196 --> 37:43.968
Want me to do your makeup
later?

37:46.307 --> 37:48.845
Would you?

37:48.846 --> 37:50.984
Sure.

37:50.985 --> 37:53.991
Just let me
finish this first.

37:56.197 --> 37:58.970
I'm going to do your eyes purple
to match your pants, okay?

37:58.971 --> 38:00.774
And I'll give it to you
when I'm done,

38:00.775 --> 38:02.879
so you can have it.

38:10.431 --> 38:13.772
I never got a professional
makeup job before.

38:13.773 --> 38:14.975
Thank you.

38:19.719 --> 38:21.992
You know, every Friday night
in my cell,

38:21.993 --> 38:24.264
we'd have ladies' night.

38:24.265 --> 38:26.569
We'd put on face masks
and wear lingerie

38:26.570 --> 38:28.174
and stuff like that.

38:31.314 --> 38:33.521
Lingerie in jail.

38:33.521 --> 38:34.923
You're really nuts.

38:34.924 --> 38:36.600
That's what happens

38:36.610 --> 38:38.300
when you got to wear
state clothes every day.

38:40.437 --> 38:43.410
You didn't go with any girls,
did you?

38:48.856 --> 38:50.194
No.

38:50.195 --> 38:52.466
Some girls in there
tried to get with me,

38:52.467 --> 38:56.730
but I told them
what time it was.

39:07.670 --> 39:09.706
Daddy.

39:09.707 --> 39:12.580
Sherry Anne.

39:12.581 --> 39:13.682
What's that?

39:13.683 --> 39:15.487
Hi.
How are you?

39:15.488 --> 39:16.823
Well, we got
into some traffic.

39:16.824 --> 39:18.126
Hey, Marcia.

39:18.127 --> 39:19.631
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>
Good.

39:19.632 --> 39:21.101
<i>Don't cry.</i>
<i>You'll make me cry.</i>

39:22.871 --> 39:25.278
Oh.

39:25.279 --> 39:27.616
Come on, stop it.

39:27.617 --> 39:30.255
It's okay.

39:30.257 --> 39:32.662
We should have taken 22,
and...

39:32.663 --> 39:34.833
I missed you so much.

39:34.833 --> 39:37.239
I missed you too.

39:38.742 --> 39:41.115
Come on,
say hi to my wife.

39:41.115 --> 39:42.151
Look at my makeup.

39:42.152 --> 39:43.589
It's real pretty.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.910
<i>Yeah, we took 78, and--</i>

39:45.920 --> 39:46.461
Remember Marcia?

39:46.463 --> 39:47.598
Hi.
Hi.

39:49.340 --> 39:50.360
Bob.

39:50.370 --> 39:51.240
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

39:51.241 --> 39:53.278
You really got to clean out
those gutters, you know?

39:53.279 --> 39:54.814
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, I know.</i>

39:59.560 --> 40:00.662
This ought
to help you out.

40:00.664 --> 40:01.732
You know, Dad,

40:01.733 --> 40:05.574
<i>you don't</i>
<i>have to give me money.</i>

40:06.677 --> 40:07.747
<i>Grandpa's here.</i>

40:07.748 --> 40:08.749
Oh, there she is.

40:08.750 --> 40:09.984
Oh, Lexi.

40:09.985 --> 40:11.889
There's my precious
little girl.

40:11.890 --> 40:14.228
Here, honey.
This is for you.

40:14.229 --> 40:15.598
Can I just
fix this?

40:15.599 --> 40:16.901
Dad.

40:16.902 --> 40:17.936
Oh, this is hot.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.206
Attagirl.

40:19.207 --> 40:21.780
Look at you and Grandpa.

40:21.781 --> 40:23.115
What do you say, Alexis?

40:23.116 --> 40:24.118
Thank you, Grandma.

40:24.119 --> 40:25.220
<i>You're welcome.</i>

40:25.221 --> 40:26.257
Hey, Dad.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.727
Hey, Dad.

40:27.729 --> 40:29.832
Dad, look at how much
we look alike

40:29.833 --> 40:31.836
now that she's
got bigger.

40:31.837 --> 40:32.839
Look at that.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.778
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

40:34.779 --> 40:35.879
What do you got there?

40:35.880 --> 40:37.149
Dad.

40:37.150 --> 40:40.291
Dad, there's a--
I want to show you something.

40:40.292 --> 40:41.694
<i>Daddy.</i>

40:41.695 --> 40:42.730
Come on.

40:42.731 --> 40:43.898
I want to show you
something.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.470
Come on.
Let's go see what Sherry wants.

40:45.471 --> 40:46.473
<i>I got my GED.</i>

40:46.474 --> 40:47.475
Okeydoke.

40:47.476 --> 40:48.611
<i>Okeydoke.</i>

40:48.612 --> 40:51.752
<i>I want to show you.</i>

40:51.753 --> 40:54.792
I want to welcome home
my baby,

40:54.793 --> 40:56.929
Sherry Anne.

40:56.930 --> 40:59.269
Welcome home,
Sher.

41:00.606 --> 41:02.611
Cheers. Cheers.

41:02.612 --> 41:03.547
Cheers.

41:05.184 --> 41:06.286
<i>I want soda.</i>

41:07.589 --> 41:08.625
Milk first.

41:08.626 --> 41:10.930
<i>Then you'll get</i>
<i>your soda.</i>

41:10.931 --> 41:14.440
Hey, Lynnie,
this sure looks good.

41:14.441 --> 41:17.915
Did you help with this?

41:17.916 --> 41:18.917
No.

41:23.260 --> 41:24.664
So how's the Caddy
holding up, Dad?

41:24.665 --> 41:26.201
Eat your burger first.

41:26.202 --> 41:27.872
<i>It's the perfect piece</i>
<i>of machinery.</i>

41:27.873 --> 41:29.609
<i>You know, you've had</i>
<i>that car so long,</i>

41:29.610 --> 41:30.712
<i>I don't think it's safe</i>
<i>for you</i>

41:30.713 --> 41:31.949
to drive it down to Florida
this year.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.151
<i>I don't think so either.</i>

41:33.152 --> 41:34.220
<i>You need a new car,</i>
<i>Dad.</i>

41:34.221 --> 41:35.222
Now?

41:35.224 --> 41:36.358
Okay.

41:36.359 --> 41:38.280
I swear, she's hooked
on the Disney Channel.

41:40.340 --> 41:41.370
<i>Did you see that email</i>

41:41.371 --> 41:42.373
Marty sent around?

41:42.374 --> 41:43.475
Bobby, that's disgusting.

41:43.476 --> 41:45.313
We're eating here.

41:45.314 --> 41:47.652
<i>They're going to start charging</i>
<i>for emails, you know.</i>

41:47.653 --> 41:49.624
<i>Alexis, come eat</i>
<i>more of your burger.</i>

41:49.625 --> 41:51.495
<i>That's what I keep saying,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

41:51.496 --> 41:53.600
<i>That Marty,</i>
<i>he's a real piece of work.</i>

41:53.601 --> 41:55.136
I don't know
where he finds that stuff,

41:55.137 --> 41:57.877
but he does.

41:57.878 --> 42:00.851
<i>Come on, pass me</i>
<i>that potato salad.</i>

42:00.852 --> 42:02.822
<i>There you go.</i>

42:02.823 --> 42:04.961
<i>I don't want to waste room</i>
<i>on salad.</i>

42:04.962 --> 42:07.935
Yeah?

42:07.936 --> 42:09.380
You do?

42:09.390 --> 42:10.373
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:10.374 --> 42:13.213
Okay, Alexis wants
to hear me sing for you all.

42:13.214 --> 42:14.885
Spare us, Sher.

42:14.886 --> 42:16.488
We don't want to break
any glasses.

42:21.166 --> 42:22.234
<i>Alexis.</i>

42:25.175 --> 42:26.546
<i>* Close your eyes. *</i>

42:26.547 --> 42:29.821
your hand, *

42:29.822 --> 42:31.959
* darling. *

42:31.960 --> 42:37.338
* Do you feel
my heart beating? *

42:37.339 --> 42:39.410
<i>* Do you understand? *</i>

42:39.411 --> 42:41.782
<i>* Do you feel *</i>

42:41.783 --> 42:44.254
* the same, *

42:44.255 --> 42:47.294
* or am I only *

42:47.295 --> 42:50.235
<i>* dreaming? *</i>

42:50.237 --> 42:52.341
<i>* Or is *</i>

42:52.342 --> 43:00.226
his burning
an eternal flame? *

43:00.227 --> 43:02.900
<i>* I believe *</i>

43:02.901 --> 43:06.700
<i>* we're meant to be, *</i>

43:06.800 --> 43:07.242
<i>* darling. *</i>

43:07.243 --> 43:12.857
* I watched you
when you were sleeping. *

43:12.858 --> 43:16.310
* You belong with me. *

43:16.320 --> 43:20.410
<i>* Do you feel the same, *</i>

43:20.420 --> 43:26.156
<i>* or am I only dreaming? *</i>

43:26.157 --> 43:28.728
<i>* Or is *</i>

43:28.729 --> 43:36.213
* this burning
an eternal flame? *

43:40.322 --> 43:41.425
That was good, Sher.

43:41.426 --> 43:43.230
Should have gone
on <i>American Idol.</i>

43:43.231 --> 43:44.432
You'd probably win.

43:44.433 --> 43:47.139
Don't be a wise guy.

43:47.140 --> 43:48.142
Sherry's a good singer.

43:48.143 --> 43:49.879
<i>Beautiful, baby.</i>

43:49.880 --> 43:52.953
Okay, I'm going to get
some more wine.

43:54.490 --> 43:57.597
<i>Come on, baby bear.</i>

43:57.598 --> 43:58.733
<i>I'm putting him in.</i>

43:58.734 --> 44:00.300
<i>I'm putting him in.</i>

44:00.400 --> 44:04.470
I think this looks good
like that.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.616
Can I come in yet?

44:05.617 --> 44:07.254
<i>Nope.</i>

44:07.255 --> 44:09.659
Is that good?

44:09.660 --> 44:11.698
<i>Yeah, that's good.</i>

44:11.699 --> 44:14.370
<i>This can be your baby.</i>

44:14.371 --> 44:16.576
And this can be mine.

44:16.577 --> 44:18.348
What's your baby's name?

44:18.349 --> 44:21.889
My baby...

44:21.890 --> 44:23.580
um...

44:23.590 --> 44:25.798
my baby is named Alexis.

44:25.799 --> 44:27.269
No!

44:27.270 --> 44:29.400
What do you mean, "no"?

44:29.410 --> 44:32.470
This is pretend,

44:32.480 --> 44:35.389
and you have to pick
a new name.

44:35.390 --> 44:37.259
Why?

44:37.260 --> 44:39.631
Because.

44:39.632 --> 44:42.940
But Alexis
is my favorite name.

44:42.941 --> 44:44.209
No.

44:44.210 --> 44:46.381
Besides, there could be
two Alexises.

44:46.382 --> 44:48.787
Well, okay.

44:48.788 --> 44:50.190
You can call her that,

44:50.192 --> 44:53.231
but then my baby's name
can be Sherry.

44:53.232 --> 44:56.406
Two Alexises
and two Sherrys.

44:56.406 --> 44:57.641
Two Alexises...

44:57.642 --> 44:59.679
And two Sherrys.

45:00.682 --> 45:05.193
Ah!

45:05.194 --> 45:06.196
Mm-mm.

45:06.197 --> 45:07.933
In the fort,
in here.

45:07.934 --> 45:08.936
Let's go.

45:08.937 --> 45:09.938
Okay.

45:09.939 --> 45:14.181
Should I take
this Sherry?

45:15.485 --> 45:19.227
Lynnie told me to call you
Sherry, not Mommy.

45:20.765 --> 45:25.541
Yeah, I figured.

45:25.542 --> 45:27.790
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

45:27.800 --> 45:28.549
When you come
and live with me,

45:28.550 --> 45:30.454
<i>you can call me Momm</i>

45:30.455 --> 45:32.859
Alexis, Grandma Mary's here
to see you.

45:32.860 --> 45:34.960
<i>Grandma Mary.</i>

45:34.970 --> 45:36.735
No, baby.

45:36.736 --> 45:38.173
<i>She's waiting.</i>

45:39.843 --> 45:42.450
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

45:42.451 --> 45:44.200
<i>Hi, Grandma.</i>

45:44.210 --> 45:48.290
You are confusing her
with this Sherry bullshit.

45:48.300 --> 45:50.340
I'm confusing her?

45:50.350 --> 45:51.538
I don't think so.

45:51.539 --> 45:53.740
She was fine
until you showed up again.

45:53.750 --> 45:54.378
I'm her mother.

45:54.379 --> 45:55.380
Well, act like one.

45:55.381 --> 45:56.783
What, are you
fucking jealous?

45:56.784 --> 45:58.788
You want to--you're gonna
curse in front of her?

45:58.789 --> 46:00.292
You want to see
my stretch marks, Lyn?

46:00.293 --> 46:01.628
<i>Don't be disgusting.</i>

46:01.629 --> 46:04.702
Check this out.
You want to check this out?

46:22.770 --> 46:24.584
It's just too many people
in a house.

46:41.290 --> 46:44.231
I told you, you can't just keep
sleeping on the floor like that.

46:44.232 --> 46:46.570
You should be on my side.

46:52.951 --> 46:55.491
<i>Here, you need some cash?</i>

46:55.492 --> 46:58.765
Daddy, gave me
some cash.

46:58.766 --> 47:02.341
Sherry, here.

47:02.342 --> 47:05.716
I'm your fucking sister.

47:05.717 --> 47:07.185
Shit!

47:07.186 --> 47:12.465
I'll just wait out here,
make sure you get a room.

47:27.330 --> 47:29.640
Dean, hey, it's Sherry,

47:29.641 --> 47:31.478
Tony Martino's girl.

47:31.479 --> 47:32.513
Yeah.

47:33.983 --> 47:37.859
Yeah, I met you
at Genesis Recovery, remember?

47:37.860 --> 47:40.700
I was just, um...

47:40.701 --> 47:44.410
uh...

47:46.790 --> 47:51.225
Well, I was just calling
because I was--

47:51.226 --> 47:58.175
I was...

47:58.176 --> 48:00.414
I was wondering if, um--

48:00.415 --> 48:02.519
what you were doing.

48:18.123 --> 48:19.192
<i>Who's there?</i>

48:19.193 --> 48:21.130
<i>Dean.</i>

48:32.657 --> 48:34.228
Greetings.

48:34.229 --> 48:37.168
Damn, you got here late.

48:45.254 --> 48:47.225
Oh, no.

48:57.584 --> 48:59.522
Damn.

49:03.732 --> 49:05.302
<i>You like my hair?</i>

49:05.304 --> 49:08.430
Yeah, it ain't bad.

49:24.820 --> 49:27.522
Ooh, look at that.

49:27.523 --> 49:29.126
Mm-hmm.

49:29.127 --> 49:30.864
Mmm.

49:30.865 --> 49:34.372
Looking good,
little Lolita.

49:34.374 --> 49:38.248
Don't call me that.

49:42.659 --> 49:44.597
You got to stop
drinking that poison.

50:04.377 --> 50:05.881
Did you ever
see me dance?

50:05.882 --> 50:08.188
Oh, yeah.

50:08.189 --> 50:10.425
Are you going to dance
for me tonight?

50:10.426 --> 50:11.427
No.

50:11.428 --> 50:16.439
I gave that shit up.

50:18.812 --> 50:19.982
Good little girl.

50:19.983 --> 50:25.270
Doesn't dance
for anybody anymore.

50:59.543 --> 51:01.582
You had any police contact
this weekend, Swanson?

51:01.583 --> 51:03.419
No, but I called--
On the wall!

51:03.420 --> 51:04.689
Get your hands
on the wall now!

51:04.690 --> 51:06.392
I told you I was going
to my brother's house.

51:06.393 --> 51:08.640
I called you. I left you a--
you didn't get my message?

51:08.650 --> 51:09.670
Shut up!

51:09.680 --> 51:10.690
What the fuck?

51:10.700 --> 51:11.172
You can stay
where you want,

51:11.173 --> 51:13.177
but you will go through
the proper channels.

51:13.177 --> 51:14.881
Spread 'em.
Kick your shoes off; let's go.

51:14.882 --> 51:17.354
Kick them off.
Kick them off.

51:17.354 --> 51:18.856
Spread 'em out.
Come on; let's go.

51:18.857 --> 51:19.859
You've done this before.

51:19.860 --> 51:21.290
Pat her down.

51:21.300 --> 51:22.799
Keep that chest
pressed against the wall.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.737
<i>You think just because you can</i>
<i>send me back to prison,</i>

51:24.738 --> 51:25.840
<i>you're strong?</i>

51:25.841 --> 51:27.143
<i>Control yourself.</i>
I'm strong.

51:27.144 --> 51:28.146
<i>Shut up.</i>

51:28.147 --> 51:30.351
Stand up straight.

51:30.352 --> 51:33.157
Right foot up.
Right foot up.

51:33.159 --> 51:34.995
Right foot up.

51:34.996 --> 51:36.399
You are fucking
with the wrong one today.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.702
Put your right foot up.
Get your foot up!

51:39.205 --> 51:41.311
Left foot up.

51:41.312 --> 51:43.810
Left food up.

51:43.820 --> 51:45.387
Spread 'em.
Officer.

51:51.568 --> 51:54.843
<i>I could violate your ass</i>
<i>right now,</i>

51:54.844 --> 51:56.450
send you back to prison
for two more years.

51:56.470 --> 51:56.982
Is that what you want?

52:10.748 --> 52:14.230
But a job came through
for you,

52:14.240 --> 52:16.963
and I'm going
to let you take it.

52:20.938 --> 52:23.544
Top of your head.
Look away.

52:29.225 --> 52:30.429
Listen,
I'm going to do good.

52:30.430 --> 52:31.764
Just--just be quiet.

52:31.765 --> 52:33.669
I graduated a lot of programs
when I was in prison.

52:33.670 --> 52:36.109
Look, shut up.

52:36.110 --> 52:38.460
Put your shoes back on.

52:44.128 --> 52:46.100
It's a Catholic Charities
youth organization,

52:46.101 --> 52:48.170
summer program
over on Irvine Turner.

52:48.172 --> 52:50.510
Monroe somehow convinced them

52:50.511 --> 52:53.830
<i>that you'd been</i>
<i>rehabilitated.</i>

52:53.830 --> 52:54.587
<i>Here's the address.</i>

53:01.703 --> 53:05.246
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

53:05.247 --> 53:06.681
Thank you.

53:08.219 --> 53:09.890
<i>Everybody in line?</i>
<i>Everybody ready?</i>

53:09.891 --> 53:11.961
<i>I want to see if you guys</i>
<i>are tough.</i>

53:11.962 --> 53:13.532
All right.
Okay, come on.

53:13.533 --> 53:15.235
Let's see what you got.

53:15.237 --> 53:16.772
Good, good.

53:16.773 --> 53:17.775
Okay, end of the line.

53:17.776 --> 53:19.110
What's your name?
Zak.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.415
Okay, Zak,
let's see what you got.

53:20.416 --> 53:21.417
Uh-huh, uh-huh,

53:21.418 --> 53:22.587
but this is what
you got to do.

53:22.588 --> 53:24.124
You got to bend
your knees, see?

53:24.125 --> 53:25.427
And you got
to follow through.

53:25.428 --> 53:26.429
Okay, let's see.

53:26.430 --> 53:28.434
Follow through.
Good, good.

53:28.435 --> 53:29.804
You are a little badass.

53:29.805 --> 53:30.806
One more.

53:30.807 --> 53:31.943
Ow!

53:31.944 --> 53:33.179
Ow, he's strong.

53:33.180 --> 53:34.281
He's--how about you?

53:34.282 --> 53:35.451
What have you got?

53:35.452 --> 53:36.787
You got to show me
a little harder.

53:36.788 --> 53:38.593
I want to see
that power you got.

53:38.594 --> 53:39.828
Good.

53:39.829 --> 53:41.933
Yeah, you know
what you're doing.

53:41.934 --> 53:43.170
You got to bend
your knees.

53:43.171 --> 53:44.439
You got to focus,
Chastity.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.442
You got to focus.

53:45.443 --> 53:46.578
You got to focus.

53:46.579 --> 53:47.947
Yeah, what's your name?

53:47.948 --> 53:49.485
Russel.
That's good, Russel.

53:49.486 --> 53:50.887
One more, Russel.
You got one more.

53:50.888 --> 53:52.559
Good, good, good.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.828
All right,
I know your name.

53:53.829 --> 53:56.101
Let's see--

53:56.102 --> 53:57.103
Okay.

53:57.104 --> 53:58.406
We can't play
this game anymore.

53:58.407 --> 53:59.409
Let's play another game.

53:59.410 --> 54:00.544
Let's play z

54:00.545 --> 54:03.619
Okay, who told me
they wanted to be a dinosaur?

54:44.717 --> 54:45.820
What's up?

54:45.821 --> 54:47.524
What are you
doing here?

54:47.525 --> 54:49.261
I just came by
to say hey.

54:49.262 --> 54:53.438
Uh... I'm kind of busy
right now.

54:53.439 --> 54:55.142
Oh, yeah?

54:55.143 --> 54:56.881
Yeah.

54:56.882 --> 55:00.870
You got a broad
in there?

55:02.259 --> 55:04.866
I fucking thought
you liked me, man.

55:04.867 --> 55:06.202
I do like you.

55:06.203 --> 55:07.605
Hey, no, wait,
wait, wait.

55:07.606 --> 55:09.410
<i>From a bank robbery</i>

55:09.411 --> 55:10.814
<i>at 1091 3rd Avenue.</i>

55:10.815 --> 55:12.718
<i>A male black</i>
<i>about 6 feet tall</i>

55:12.719 --> 55:15.725
<i>with one eye,</i>
<i>wearing a white do-rag</i>

55:15.726 --> 55:17.529
<i>under a yellow hard hat.</i>

55:17.530 --> 55:18.833
<i>The direction?</i>

55:18.834 --> 55:20.536
<i>It's heading...</i>

55:20.537 --> 55:23.343
All right, come back
in 20 minutes, all right?

55:23.344 --> 55:25.950
Yeah, okay.
Okay!

55:25.951 --> 55:27.888
20 minutes.

56:07.248 --> 56:09.219
So what's her name?

56:09.220 --> 56:10.221
<i>Where does she live?</i>

56:10.222 --> 56:11.526
<i>Why should I tell you,</i>

56:11.527 --> 56:12.963
<i>so you can hunt her down</i>
<i>and beat her ass?</i>

56:12.964 --> 56:15.335
No, I'm not going
back to prison, Dean.

56:15.336 --> 56:17.390
I just want to know
who this bitch is

56:17.400 --> 56:19.712
you'd rather be fucking
than me.

56:19.713 --> 56:22.786
<i>No way you want to go</i>
<i>down that road.</i>

56:22.787 --> 56:27.296
Oh, yeah, tell me more.

56:27.297 --> 56:28.567
I be you wouldn't like it

56:28.568 --> 56:30.939
<i>if I started fucking</i>
<i>Andy Kelly.</i>

56:30.940 --> 56:32.241
<i>It wouldn't matter to me.</i>

56:32.242 --> 56:34.114
Oh, no?

56:34.115 --> 56:36.920
Fucking figures.

56:36.921 --> 56:39.291
At least he knows
how to eat pussy.

56:40.929 --> 56:42.265
What was that?
I didn't hear you.

56:42.266 --> 56:43.970
Nothing.

56:49.885 --> 56:52.570
Shit.

56:53.125 --> 56:54.997
I'm sorry.

56:56.968 --> 57:00.420
I'm such a piece of shit
sometimes.

57:00.430 --> 57:02.481
I can't control myself.

57:02.482 --> 57:06.390
Nobody owns anybody.

57:06.391 --> 57:10.100
The state of New Jersey
owns my ass.

57:17.484 --> 57:20.792
I miss my friend, man.

57:20.793 --> 57:22.195
Crusher.

57:22.196 --> 57:23.699
<i>She always had my back.</i>

57:23.700 --> 57:25.336
Well, I can be your friend.

57:25.337 --> 57:26.906
It's not about that.

57:30.140 --> 57:32.486
What are you cooking?

57:32.487 --> 57:34.491
Venison stew.

57:35.928 --> 57:37.365
What's that?

57:37.366 --> 57:39.436
It's deer meat.

57:39.437 --> 57:41.108
Mmm.

57:41.109 --> 57:43.713
I never ate Bambi before.

57:43.714 --> 57:45.752
Well, actually,
it isn't Bambi.

57:45.753 --> 57:48.927
It's Bambi's daddy.

57:48.927 --> 57:50.950
Ooh, yeah?

57:50.960 --> 57:54.606
Bambi's daddy,
that's pretty funny.

58:14.587 --> 58:17.862
Bobby, hey, what's up?

58:17.863 --> 58:19.398
Yeah?

58:19.399 --> 58:22.606
I had my first day
of work today.

58:22.607 --> 58:23.776
It was cool.

58:23.777 --> 58:26.549
Made me think of my baby.

58:26.550 --> 58:32.364
Is she there?
I really want to talk to her.

58:32.365 --> 58:34.937
Why do you always got to tell me
the same shit, Bobby?

58:34.938 --> 58:36.106
I know she's there.

58:36.107 --> 58:37.575
I know she's fucking awake.

58:37.576 --> 58:43.523
It's 7:30.

58:43.524 --> 58:44.626
What about her birthday?

58:44.627 --> 58:47.266
You guys have
anything planned?

58:47.267 --> 58:49.739
Oh, yeah, I will--
I will be there.

59:28.532 --> 59:30.470
* Yeah, we do! *

01:00:07.627 --> 01:00:11.000
<i>Okay, at this next block,</i>

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.337
turn left.

01:00:12.338 --> 01:00:14.410
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.780
<i>It's the third house</i>
<i>on the left.</i>

01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:18.385
<i>You grew up there?</i>

01:00:18.386 --> 01:00:19.521
<i>Yup.</i>

01:00:19.522 --> 01:00:21.425
<i>That's fancy.</i>

01:00:21.426 --> 01:00:23.620
<i>I guess.</i>

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.650
<i>You want to come in</i>

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.402
and meet my family?

01:00:25.403 --> 01:00:27.740
No, no, you go
and enjoy your daughter.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.816
Call me when you're ready
to be picked up.

01:00:34.323 --> 01:00:35.993
All right,
I'll see you later.

01:00:35.994 --> 01:00:37.431
Bye-bye.

01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:48.123
Hello!

01:00:56.143 --> 01:00:57.812
Hey, wait.

01:00:57.813 --> 01:00:58.948
Dean!

01:00:58.949 --> 01:01:01.989
Dean, wait!
Wait! Wait!

01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:07.870
Those fuckers aren't home.

01:01:07.871 --> 01:01:09.730
<i>What do you want</i>
<i>to do?</i>

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.680
Um...

01:01:11.681 --> 01:01:13.350
Let's go
to my dad's house.

01:01:13.351 --> 01:01:16.900
Maybe they're there.

01:01:39.178 --> 01:01:41.217
You're late.
We just finished the cake.

01:01:41.218 --> 01:01:43.322
Well, maybe if you'd told me
where the party was at--

01:01:43.323 --> 01:01:45.159
hold on one second.

01:01:53.146 --> 01:01:55.951
<i>Hey, Alexis, I think you have</i>
<i>more presents to open.</i>

01:01:55.952 --> 01:01:57.489
<i>Don't push me.</i>

01:01:59.896 --> 01:02:02.635
Hi, Alexis.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:05.643
Alexis, hey.

01:02:05.644 --> 01:02:07.915
Happy birthday, baby.

01:02:07.916 --> 01:02:09.518
Happy birthday.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.832
<i>Happy, happy,</i>
<i>happy birthday.</i>

01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:16.769
Sherry brought you
some presents.

01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:18.400
What do you say?

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.900
Thanks.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.346
Here you go, babe.

01:02:21.347 --> 01:02:22.349
Can I open it?

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.119
Go ahead; open it.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.656
<i>Open all of them.</i>
<i>Open them.</i>

01:02:25.657 --> 01:02:26.759
<i>I want to open one.</i>

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.196
Oh, look at this.

01:02:28.197 --> 01:02:31.538
You're going to look
just like a ballerina.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.430
<i>Sherry Anne.</i>

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.554
Welcome.

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:39.757
Can I get you a drink?

01:02:39.758 --> 01:02:41.997
Yeah, thanks.

01:02:41.998 --> 01:02:44.134
Number two.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:45.739
<i>I don't want to play anymore!</i>

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.211
Look at it.
Look at the front, though.

01:02:48.212 --> 01:02:50.583
Candy lipstick.

01:02:50.584 --> 01:02:53.824
And this is special gum.

01:02:53.825 --> 01:02:54.961
Special gum?

01:02:54.962 --> 01:02:56.163
Yeah, but it's inside.

01:02:56.164 --> 01:02:57.366
So much candy.

01:02:57.367 --> 01:02:59.805
You want to open it?

01:02:59.806 --> 01:03:01.677
Game Boy.

01:03:01.678 --> 01:03:03.715
You have one of those
already, sweetie.

01:03:03.716 --> 01:03:05.218
You do?
I could take it back.

01:03:05.219 --> 01:03:07.323
If you want to,
I'll find you something else.

01:03:07.324 --> 01:03:08.459
No.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:09.629
I want two Game Boys.

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:11.199
You can't have two;
that's silly.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.371
You can have
whatever you want, baby.

01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:15.376
<i>Lookit. You got finger paints.</i>

01:03:15.377 --> 01:03:16.947
<i>No!</i>

01:03:16.948 --> 01:03:18.651
That's my present!

01:03:18.652 --> 01:03:20.540
It's mine.

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:22.627
No fair.

01:03:22.628 --> 01:03:25.132
It's my present.

01:03:25.133 --> 01:03:26.637
Yes, honey.

01:03:26.638 --> 01:03:27.639
Alexis.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.775
It's your present.

01:03:28.776 --> 01:03:30.211
Nobody is going to take it
away from you.

01:03:30.212 --> 01:03:31.916
<i>What happened?</i>

01:03:31.917 --> 01:03:34.287
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:35.424
Let's go, guys.

01:03:35.425 --> 01:03:37.396
Let's go downstairs
and play musical chairs.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.666
<i>Let's go, everybody.</i>

01:03:38.667 --> 01:03:40.200
I think they need
some time out.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.974
<i>You come too.</i>

01:03:41.975 --> 01:03:44.790
<i>Here we go, everybody.</i>

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.515
<i>We're all coming.</i>

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.462
What a mess, huh?

01:03:51.463 --> 01:03:54.503
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:03:54.504 --> 01:03:58.780
<i>Okay, not fair.</i>

01:04:03.157 --> 01:04:04.259
You all right?

01:04:08.169 --> 01:04:11.678
<i>Dad,</i>

01:04:11.679 --> 01:04:14.151
I feel like--

01:04:14.152 --> 01:04:16.210
I don't know what to do.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.730
I feel like they're taking her
away from me.

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:22.905
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.281
Bobby and Lynette,
they love you a whole lot.

01:04:27.282 --> 01:04:29.200
I love you.

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:33.531
<i>Dad, she won't even talk to me.</i>

01:04:33.531 --> 01:04:37.606
You should have seen her
when I first came back.

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:38.876
She was playing with me.

01:04:38.877 --> 01:04:39.913
She was hugging me.

01:04:39.914 --> 01:04:41.116
She was calling me Mommy.

01:04:41.117 --> 01:04:44.757
They told her
not to call me Mommy anymore.

01:04:44.758 --> 01:04:46.161
<i>Can you believe that shit?</i>

01:04:46.162 --> 01:04:48.650
<i>Sherry, just give them</i>
<i>some time</i>

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.669
<i>to get used to you again.</i>

01:04:50.905 --> 01:04:53.100
Come on.

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.949
I know, but...

01:04:57.922 --> 01:04:59.861
Come on.

01:05:08.214 --> 01:05:10.319
<i>Just give it a little time,</i>
<i>honey.</i>

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:26.490
<i>What?</i>

01:05:29.631 --> 01:05:33.207
Sherry, what?

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:13.904
Baby, you got
that taste?

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:56.895
Keep you coming back.

01:08:56.897 --> 01:08:58.399
It works if you work it.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.938
It won't if you don't.

01:09:06.519 --> 01:09:08.220
What happened to you?

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:10.996
I walked home, man.

01:09:10.997 --> 01:09:14.200
You're also fucked up.

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.506
Come on;
let's go clean you up.

01:09:15.508 --> 01:09:18.782
Hey, lay off the goods,
man.

01:09:18.783 --> 01:09:20.319
I can walk.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.256
Well, then, let's walk.

01:09:56.305 --> 01:09:57.842
<i>Can I come in?</i>

01:09:57.843 --> 01:09:59.813
Yeah.

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.240
<i>Come on;</i>
<i>get undressed.</i>

01:10:44.154 --> 01:10:48.129
You are a real,
live Injun, Dean.

01:10:56.583 --> 01:11:00.960
I bet you're
a good dad.

01:11:00.961 --> 01:11:04.669
It's too bad your kids
never get to see you.

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:09.781
I'm--I'm going
this winter.

01:11:09.782 --> 01:11:11.719
Want to go with me?

01:11:16.164 --> 01:11:18.268
One day
at a time, right?

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:24.817
<i>Hey.</i>

01:11:24.818 --> 01:11:26.210
Lazy lady.

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:27.323
Come on, sleepy,
get up.

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:29.997
Wake up.

01:11:29.998 --> 01:11:33.700
I was dreaming so much.

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:36.245
I want my baby back, Dean.

01:11:36.246 --> 01:11:40.722
I want Alexis.

01:11:40.723 --> 01:11:42.660
You know, if you
stop talking so much

01:11:42.661 --> 01:11:45.233
about what you want,
stop being so selfish,

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:50.512
maybe what you want
will come to you on its own.

01:11:50.513 --> 01:11:52.450
Okay.

01:11:57.162 --> 01:11:59.467
I'm just mad
'cause I suck.

01:12:03.143 --> 01:12:05.648
Shit.

01:12:05.649 --> 01:12:07.888
Dean?

01:12:07.889 --> 01:12:09.291
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:12.265
Do you have a long-sleeved shirt
or something I could borrow?

01:12:12.267 --> 01:12:16.700
I can't go out like this.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.150
* Wayp in the sky. *

01:12:20.151 --> 01:12:22.122
* Way up in the sky. *

01:12:22.123 --> 01:12:24.427
* The mama bird flies. *

01:12:24.428 --> 01:12:27.936
* The mama bird flies. *

01:12:27.937 --> 01:12:31.770
* While down in the nest. *

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.582
* While down in the nest. *

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:36.289
<i>* The baby birds rest. *</i>

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:42.570
* The baby birds rest. *

01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:44.843
* wing on the left. *

01:12:44.844 --> 01:12:48.170
* With a wing on the left. *

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.824
* And a... *

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:53.630
* wing on the right. *

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:57.673
* And a wing on the right. *

01:12:57.674 --> 01:13:00.447
* The baby bird sleeps. *

01:13:00.448 --> 01:13:03.654
* The baby bird sleeps. *

01:13:03.655 --> 01:13:07.196
* All through the night. *

01:13:07.197 --> 01:13:10.700
* All through the night. *

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:11.105
Shh!

01:13:11.106 --> 01:13:13.100
Shh!

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:15.784
<i>Baby bird.</i>

01:13:15.785 --> 01:13:19.759
They're sleeping.

01:13:30.286 --> 01:13:34.228
How was work today?

01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:35.798
How'd you get in here?

01:13:35.799 --> 01:13:38.300
I'm the one
who asks the questions.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.307
<i>I don't answer.</i>

01:13:39.308 --> 01:13:41.879
Fuck me, snoopy.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.819
<i>You got to give me</i>
<i>a break.</i>

01:13:52.171 --> 01:13:54.710
You look terrible.

01:13:54.711 --> 01:13:55.646
Yeah.

01:14:01.226 --> 01:14:02.963
What's going on?

01:14:06.739 --> 01:14:09.440
I'm going to tell you
the truth.

01:14:14.559 --> 01:14:16.497
I'm in trouble.

01:14:22.311 --> 01:14:24.749
I'm dirty.

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:26.888
You want to get clean?

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.967
You want inpatient?

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.870
No, I want outpatient.
Or prison.

01:14:33.871 --> 01:14:37.179
No, because
I have to keep this job.

01:14:38.315 --> 01:14:39.986
This job is the only thing
that I haven't--

01:14:39.987 --> 01:14:41.457
Please, please,
let me keep this job.

01:14:41.458 --> 01:14:42.559
It's inpatient
or prison.

01:14:44.296 --> 01:14:46.000
Hello.

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.371
Yeah, I got my PO here.

01:14:47.372 --> 01:14:49.676
Can I call you back?

01:14:49.677 --> 01:14:52.716
Please, please, please,
please, please.

01:14:52.717 --> 01:14:54.655
I lost my daughter.
I lost her.

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.859
I don't know--there's no
other way I can get her back.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.433
Inpatient or prison;
your choice.

01:14:59.434 --> 01:15:02.373
Ugh!

01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:03.409
You know,
I don't get you.

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:04.512
You want to get clean.

01:15:04.513 --> 01:15:05.782
You don't want
to do the work.

01:15:05.783 --> 01:15:07.510
You want your daughter,

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.762
but you don't want
to do the work.

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:16.506
I wish it could be
some other way,

01:15:16.508 --> 01:15:17.543
but at this point,

01:15:17.544 --> 01:15:22.388
you do not qualify
for outpatient.

01:15:22.389 --> 01:15:24.459
Take the weekend.

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.263
Say good-bye
to your family.

01:15:26.264 --> 01:15:28.435
Report to me Monday morning
at 8:00 a. m. ,

01:15:28.436 --> 01:15:30.106
and I will take you down.

01:15:30.107 --> 01:15:33.347
If I don't see you,
I will issue a warrant

01:15:33.348 --> 01:15:35.285
for your arrest.

01:15:58.173 --> 01:15:59.944
<i>You're probably not</i>
<i>going to believe this,</i>

01:15:59.945 --> 01:16:02.551
<i>but I think about you</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

01:16:04.354 --> 01:16:06.394
You're my sister.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.331
I never forgot you.

01:16:08.332 --> 01:16:15.113
You snaked me
with that bitch, Bobby.

01:16:15.114 --> 01:16:16.785
I can't trust you.

01:16:16.786 --> 01:16:20.828
I want you to get to know
your daughter, Sherry.

01:16:20.829 --> 01:16:22.130
I really do.

01:16:22.131 --> 01:16:24.269
<i>But you got to put yourself</i>
<i>in our shoes.</i>

01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:26.407
<i>Lynette loves</i>
<i>that little girl</i>

01:16:26.408 --> 01:16:28.580
like she was her own,
and to tell you the truth,

01:16:28.581 --> 01:16:31.921
<i>I do too.</i>

01:16:33.525 --> 01:16:34.594
<i>leave mine alone?</i>

01:16:35.463 --> 01:16:37.735
We've been taking care of her.

01:16:37.736 --> 01:16:39.573
You think that's easy?

01:16:39.574 --> 01:16:41.745
<i>And we are going</i>
<i>to have our own kid,</i>

01:16:41.746 --> 01:16:43.348
<i>maybe even two,</i>

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:45.119
but we've been taking care
of Alexis

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.690
<i>because of you,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

01:16:46.691 --> 01:16:51.134
I know. I know.
I fucked up.

01:16:51.135 --> 01:16:53.707
I always fuck up.

01:17:02.428 --> 01:17:05.100
I know what
you've been through.

01:17:05.101 --> 01:17:07.172
Don't think I don't know
what you've been through.

01:17:07.173 --> 01:17:10.280
What's that mean?

01:17:10.281 --> 01:17:11.516
It means
I'm on your side.

01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:13.354
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:17:13.355 --> 01:17:16.862
<i>It means I'm on your side,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

01:17:16.863 --> 01:17:18.332
<i>I'm on your fucking side.</i>

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.655
So will you let me
take her out alone,

01:17:27.656 --> 01:17:31.630
<i>just me and her,</i>

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.135
so she's not
scared of me anymore?

01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:39.885
<i>Okay.</i>

01:17:41.521 --> 01:17:43.660
Okay, but no sleepovers,
okay?

01:17:43.661 --> 01:17:48.471
<i>One step at a time,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

01:17:48.472 --> 01:17:49.942
You love me?

01:17:49.943 --> 01:17:52.581
Yes, I love you.

01:17:52.582 --> 01:17:55.388
<i>I know.</i>

01:18:41.699 --> 01:18:43.360
<i>No!</i>

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:44.406
<i>Alexis.</i>

01:18:46.211 --> 01:18:48.749
Oh, hi.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:49.751
<i>Hey.</i>

01:18:51.623 --> 01:18:52.926
Hi.

01:18:52.927 --> 01:18:54.563
Alexis,
go put on your shoes.

01:18:54.564 --> 01:18:55.933
Sherry's here
to take you.

01:18:55.934 --> 01:18:57.370
I'll go get her ready.

01:18:57.371 --> 01:18:59.175
I hope you're happy,

01:18:59.176 --> 01:19:01.313
because nobody else is.

01:19:01.314 --> 01:19:04.200
Excuse me.

01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:05.924
Come on,
put your shoesies on, okay?

01:19:05.925 --> 01:19:08.297
<i>And you should like...</i>

01:19:08.298 --> 01:19:11.638
Hey, Lexi.

01:19:11.639 --> 01:19:12.741
<i>What is it, baby?</i>

01:19:12.742 --> 01:19:14.144
<i>I don't want to go, Bobby.</i>

01:19:14.145 --> 01:19:15.480
<i>It's okay, sweetie.</i>

01:19:15.481 --> 01:19:17.318
You're going to have a fun day
with your mother.

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:19.657
Why, baby?
You scared?

01:19:19.658 --> 01:19:21.194
You can tell Mama.

01:19:21.195 --> 01:19:24.802
Let's pack her green shirt too,
just in case she gets dirty.

01:19:24.804 --> 01:19:26.340
Okay.

01:19:26.341 --> 01:19:27.575
I got it.

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.984
<i>Alexis, let's put</i>
<i>your backpack on.</i>

01:19:30.985 --> 01:19:32.989
<i>Come on, sweetie,</i>
<i>please.</i>

01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:34.225
I don't want to go, Bobby.

01:19:34.226 --> 01:19:36.531
Sweetie, come on;
it's going to be fun.

01:19:36.532 --> 01:19:38.134
Here, I'll carry you out,
okay?

01:19:38.135 --> 01:19:39.638
<i>Don't forget this.</i>

01:19:39.639 --> 01:19:40.708
You look so pretty
in this.

01:19:40.708 --> 01:19:42.446
<i>Oh, what a big girl.</i>

01:19:42.447 --> 01:19:43.748
Come here; let me
put this on you.

01:19:43.749 --> 01:19:46.421
Keep your hair
out of your face.

01:19:46.422 --> 01:19:47.657
<i>I'll see you later,</i>
<i>okay,</i>

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:50.970
<i>and make some cheeseburgers</i>
<i>for supper, okay?</i>

01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:51.533
<i>Okay, have fun.</i>

01:19:53.805 --> 01:19:56.913
<i>Bye, Lyn.</i>

01:19:56.914 --> 01:20:01.230
Okay.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.329
You're gonna have
a fun day, okay?

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:07.906
Remember what I told you?

01:20:07.907 --> 01:20:11.481
You're gonna have fun.

01:20:11.482 --> 01:20:14.822
Can you get the door?

01:20:14.823 --> 01:20:19.667
It's going to be a good time;
I promise, okay?

01:20:19.668 --> 01:20:20.970
Come on, let go.

01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:23.844
Let go, baby.

01:20:23.845 --> 01:20:25.181
Okay.

01:20:25.183 --> 01:20:27.119
No, no, no, no,
put it in the front seat.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.224
Sherry, it needs to go
in the back; that's the law.

01:20:29.225 --> 01:20:30.227
Always in the back, okay?

01:20:30.228 --> 01:20:32.598
Come here, sweetie.

01:20:32.599 --> 01:20:34.136
Come on, please.

01:20:34.137 --> 01:20:35.672
Come on.
Here we go.

01:20:37.643 --> 01:20:40.284
Put your legs down.

01:20:40.285 --> 01:20:42.122
Just like our car.

01:20:42.123 --> 01:20:44.193
I don't want to go,
Bobby.

01:20:44.194 --> 01:20:45.763
Okay, but see,
this is the day

01:20:45.764 --> 01:20:47.667
that you get to know Sherry
better, okay?

01:20:49.239 --> 01:20:50.308
<i>Okay?</i>

01:20:50.309 --> 01:20:51.377
Okay.

01:20:51.378 --> 01:20:52.480
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:53.649
<i>You don't want to go?</i>

01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:54.852
<i>Well, listen to me.</i>

01:20:54.853 --> 01:20:56.756
<i>You're going to have fun,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

01:20:56.757 --> 01:20:58.126
<i>I promise.</i>

01:20:58.127 --> 01:20:59.531
Okay.

01:20:59.532 --> 01:21:02.704
<i>What time are you</i>
<i>going to have her back?</i>

01:21:02.705 --> 01:21:04.509
Um...

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:06.180
I don't know,
4:00 or something.

01:21:06.181 --> 01:21:07.983
Okay, 4:00.

01:21:07.984 --> 01:21:10.290
<i>Hey. You okay, baby?</i>

01:21:11.792 --> 01:21:12.828
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:21:12.829 --> 01:21:13.998
<i>She's okay.</i>

01:21:13.999 --> 01:21:15.936
She'll be--
she'll be all right.

01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:22.586
<i>Alexis,</i>
<i>it's going to be okay.</i>

01:21:22.587 --> 01:21:26.562
<i>You're going to have</i>
<i>a fun day, okay?</i>

01:21:26.563 --> 01:21:28.733
You're going to have
a good time.

01:21:28.734 --> 01:21:30.538
Have fun with her,
okay?

01:21:30.539 --> 01:21:32.775
Thanks.

01:22:33.823 --> 01:22:36.295
* With a wing on the left. *

01:22:36.296 --> 01:22:38.802
* With a wing on the left. *

01:22:38.803 --> 01:22:41.776
* And a wing
on the right. *

01:22:41.777 --> 01:22:44.516
* And a wing
on the right. *

01:22:44.517 --> 01:22:47.556
* The baby bird
sleeps. *

01:22:47.557 --> 01:22:51.833
* The baby bird
sleeps. *

01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:53.437
* All through the night. *

01:22:53.438 --> 01:22:55.876
* All through the night. *

01:22:59.552 --> 01:23:01.322
I'm hungry.
Are you hungry?

01:23:01.323 --> 01:23:02.325
Yeah.

01:23:02.326 --> 01:23:04.620
You want junk food?

01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:05.800
Yes.
Yes.

01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:06.937
I'm starving.

01:23:06.938 --> 01:23:08.974
Me too.

01:23:08.975 --> 01:23:10.344
You want to push it?

01:23:10.345 --> 01:23:12.382
I want chicken nuggets.

01:23:12.383 --> 01:23:13.485
Okay.

01:23:13.486 --> 01:23:15.389
<i>And I want to eat...</i>

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.394
<i>french fries.</i>

01:23:17.395 --> 01:23:19.433
I want french fries too.

01:23:19.434 --> 01:23:20.870
And...

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:23.743
So when are we going to get
to miniature golf?

01:23:23.744 --> 01:23:26.517
Soon.

01:23:26.518 --> 01:23:28.688
Really soon.

01:23:28.689 --> 01:23:32.497
I've never did
miniature golf before.

01:23:32.498 --> 01:23:33.734
You never did?

01:23:33.735 --> 01:23:35.169
Uh-uh, never.

01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:37.944
That's a shame.

01:23:37.945 --> 01:23:41.190
Did you ever go
to Florida?

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.210
Florida?

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.824
Yeah.

01:23:43.825 --> 01:23:45.428
No.

01:23:45.429 --> 01:23:47.165
Me neither.

01:23:47.166 --> 01:23:49.237
You want to go?

01:23:49.238 --> 01:23:52.210
Lyn and Bobby went,

01:23:52.211 --> 01:23:54.483
and I stayed
at Grandma Mary's.

01:23:54.484 --> 01:23:55.753
Hmm.

01:23:55.754 --> 01:24:01.969
She--she lets me stay up late
and watch late movies...

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.706
This thing
looks like it hurts.

01:24:03.707 --> 01:24:08.183
And has a little dog
that's named Isabella.

01:24:08.184 --> 01:24:09.553
It's mean?

01:24:09.554 --> 01:24:13.127
No, it's named Isabella,
but it's a nice dog.

01:24:13.128 --> 01:24:15.199
It's a little
French bulldog.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.545
So do you want to go
to Florida?

01:24:20.546 --> 01:24:22.283
Mommy?

01:24:22.284 --> 01:24:24.550
Yes, my love?

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.925
I have to go
to the bathroom.

01:24:25.926 --> 01:24:27.864
You do?

01:24:27.865 --> 01:24:30.569
Okay, let's go.
One more.

01:24:36.418 --> 01:24:40.393
<i>Come on. Damn it.</i>

01:24:40.394 --> 01:24:41.462
<i>Go in the bathroom.</i>

01:24:41.463 --> 01:24:43.330
Jesus Christ.

01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:45.773
You like embarrassing me
like that?

01:24:45.774 --> 01:24:47.778
Do you?

01:24:47.779 --> 01:24:49.682
Why don't you answer me?

01:24:49.683 --> 01:24:52.824
You never listen to me,
and you never answer me.

01:24:52.825 --> 01:24:54.160
Look at me
when I talk to you.

01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:55.329
You want me
to leave you here?

01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:56.465
Is that what you want?

01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:58.136
You're lucky
that I'm here with my girl,

01:24:58.137 --> 01:24:59.773
or I'd beat the living shit
out of you,

01:24:59.774 --> 01:25:00.876
you fucking bully!

01:25:05.453 --> 01:25:07.792
Lexis?

01:25:07.793 --> 01:25:12.738
Lexis,
I'm sorry.

01:25:12.739 --> 01:25:14.408
Lexi, Lexi.

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:16.514
Hey, baby.

01:25:16.515 --> 01:25:18.284
Alexis,
what are you doing?

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:20.924
Did you go
to the bathroom?

01:25:20.925 --> 01:25:22.929
Lexi,
open up the door.

01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:25.168
Open up the door.

01:25:26.504 --> 01:25:28.943
Come here.
What is it?

01:25:29.946 --> 01:25:31.616
Oh, what happened?

01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:36.395
It's okay.

01:25:36.396 --> 01:25:38.700
I'm scared, Sherry.

01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:39.635
It's okay.

01:25:48.523 --> 01:25:49.927
All right.

01:25:49.928 --> 01:25:52.299
I'm just gonna
get the keys.

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:54.238
Ugh, fuck.

01:25:58.647 --> 01:26:01.521
Let's get these wet pants
off you.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.901
Come on, you got to help me
get your shoes off.

01:26:06.902 --> 01:26:09.107
Oh--come on.
Jesus.

01:26:09.108 --> 01:26:13.483
Okay, and you do
the other one.

01:26:16.391 --> 01:26:18.829
Fuck me.

01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:27.685
<i>Okay, look what I got.</i>

01:26:27.686 --> 01:26:28.988
<i>Oh--</i>

01:26:28.989 --> 01:26:30.157
what's that?

01:26:30.158 --> 01:26:33.130
Oh, look at this.

01:26:33.131 --> 01:26:34.935
Come on, baby.

01:26:34.936 --> 01:26:36.439
I'm trying.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.177
Come here.

01:26:38.178 --> 01:26:41.490
Okay,
take your panties off, Lex.

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.540
Sherry, close the door.

01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:44.725
Hey, you got to help me.

01:26:47.399 --> 01:26:48.334
All right.

01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:51.875
Come on, left foot.

01:26:51.876 --> 01:26:53.580
Left foot.

01:26:53.581 --> 01:26:56.153
Do you even love me?

01:27:05.274 --> 01:27:06.711
Tell me you love me.

01:27:06.712 --> 01:27:07.881
I love you.

01:27:07.882 --> 01:27:12.580
Tell me,
"I love you, Mommy. "

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:17.300
I love you, Mommy.

01:27:51.785 --> 01:27:53.724
Come on.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.879
You know what?

01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:39.333
I used to get scared too...

01:28:39.334 --> 01:28:41.272
all the time.

01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:11.143
Watch your step, honey.

01:29:11.144 --> 01:29:12.547
Why don't you go
say hi to Lynnie?

01:29:12.548 --> 01:29:14.170
She's worried about you.

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:17.692
Lyn. Come here, Lyn.
I got to tell you something.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:23.606
Did you guys have fun?

01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:27.649
Yeah.

01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:30.656
Thanks for calling.

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:39.420
You know what, Bob?

01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:40.981
What?

01:29:47.531 --> 01:29:50.271
I never asked you this
the whole time that I was away.

01:29:50.271 --> 01:29:52.241
I never asked you...

01:29:52.242 --> 01:29:54.180
Asked me what, Sherry?

01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:08.815
Could you help me
take care of my daughter?

01:30:08.816 --> 01:30:12.825
I can't do it by myself.

01:30:14.127 --> 01:30:15.364
Of course I can.

01:30:15.365 --> 01:30:17.168
What do you think
I've been doing?

01:30:17.169 --> 01:30:19.608
I know,
but I never asked you.

01:30:26.524 --> 01:30:27.593
Come here.

01:30:27.594 --> 01:30:29.798
Yes.

01:30:33.307 --> 01:30:39.288
You're gonna be okay.

01:30:44.801 --> 01:30:46.472
You want
to come inside?

01:30:46.473 --> 01:30:49.746
No.

01:30:49.747 --> 01:30:51.450
You think you were worried
about Lexi.

01:30:51.452 --> 01:30:54.858
Dean's probably waiting
by the window for his baby.

01:30:58.768 --> 01:31:01.875
Thanks.

01:31:20.955 --> 01:31:25.165
* Oh, I will free
the bird in me, *

01:31:25.166 --> 01:31:28.506
* oh, when I find my life, *

01:31:28.507 --> 01:31:31.814
* what I always knew
could be, *

01:31:31.815 --> 01:31:35.389
* oh, when I find my life. *

01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:38.764
* I will see
the truth in me, *

01:31:38.765 --> 01:31:47.452
* oh, when I find my life. *

01:31:55.839 --> 01:31:58.979
* I will see
beyond the stain, *

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.454
* oh, when I find my life. *

01:32:02.455 --> 01:32:06.164
* Fear of loss
and fear of gain, *

01:32:06.165 --> 01:32:09.438
* oh, when I find my life. *

01:32:09.438 --> 01:32:15.887
* Oh, when I find my life. *

01:32:15.888 --> 01:32:23.104
* Oh, when I find my life. *

01:32:23.105 --> 01:32:27.281
* I remember
all the days of shame *

01:32:27.282 --> 01:32:31.624
* and all the lies
you told me. *

01:32:37.205 --> 01:32:40.178
* I have worked
so hard to learn *

01:32:40.179 --> 01:32:44.890
* and come so far
in my attempts to let it go, *

01:32:44.891 --> 01:32:49.969
* my dear. *

01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:56.918
* And it's so easy. *

01:32:56.919 --> 01:33:03.567
* I just opened my eyes. *

01:33:03.568 --> 01:33:10.150
* And it's so hard *

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:13.900
* to let go. *

01:33:17.668 --> 01:33:21.543
* Oh, I will free
the bird in me *

01:33:21.544 --> 01:33:25.153
* oh, when I find my life. *

01:33:25.154 --> 01:33:28.828
* All will be
what I want to be, *

01:33:28.829 --> 01:33:31.936
* oh, when I find my life. *

01:33:31.937 --> 01:33:35.678
* I am here,
and I am free, *

01:33:35.679 --> 01:33:38.885
* oh, when I find my life. *

01:33:38.886 --> 01:33:45.769
* Oh, when I find my life. *

01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:52.886
* Oh, when I find my life. *

01:33:52.887 --> 01:33:59.135
* Oh, when I find my life. *

01:33:59.136 --> 01:34:04.882
* Oh, when I find my life. *

01:34:05.305 --> 01:34:11.253
