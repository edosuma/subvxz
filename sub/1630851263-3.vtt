Stop right there!

00:49.397 --> 00:51.442
No one robs a museum
in our city.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.227
Now put that back.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.142
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:55.185 --> 00:58.188
It's essential to my evil plan.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.320
What plan?

00:59.363 --> 01:01.539
Well, I don't want to spoil it,

01:01.583 --> 01:04.760
so I'll just say it's super evil

01:04.803 --> 01:06.283
and super deadly.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.546
Oh, come on, bruh.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.113
You gots to tell us
your plan now.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.159
Yeah. You can't drop
a bomb on us like that,

01:12.202 --> 01:13.377
and not tell us what it is.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.659
Plus, knowing what you're up to

01:14.683 --> 01:16.337
makes our job so much easier.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.208
Forget it.
I'm not telling you.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.428
Then can you
at least give us the hint?

01:20.471 --> 01:22.212
No.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.190
But you bad guys typically
love sharing your evil plans.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.129
But I'm not
your typical bad guy.

01:26.173 --> 01:29.001
I'm your worst nightmare
brought to life.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.700
The living definition of evil.

01:31.743 --> 01:34.964
I am the PP Goblin!

01:36.661 --> 01:39.664
Why do people always laugh
when I tell them my name?

01:39.708 --> 01:41.710
Because it's ridiculous, man.

01:41.753 --> 01:44.191
Hey, PP Goblin,
what's your superpower,

01:44.234 --> 01:45.714
going pee pee in the potty?

01:47.411 --> 01:49.413
No, no, no, no, no!
I am not that Pee Pee Goblin.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.023
I'm the PP Goblin,

01:51.067 --> 01:54.114
as in the goblin of Pet Peeves.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.819
What are those things?

02:08.867 --> 02:10.695
Oh, it is adorable!

02:10.739 --> 02:11.739
Ah!

02:13.524 --> 02:14.569
Hey.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.225
What are these things?

02:18.268 --> 02:21.576
They are pet peeves
come to life!

02:21.619 --> 02:23.578
These pet peeves are the worst.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.057
Duh!

02:29.366 --> 02:31.020
So long, Titans!

02:31.063 --> 02:33.240
I hope you enjoy your new pets.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.287
The PP Goblin is getting away!

02:37.331 --> 02:39.028
Yeah, we'll deal with him later.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.571
Right now, we need
to come up with a plan

02:40.595 --> 02:42.466
for getting rid
of these pet peeves.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.643
No! Down! Stop!
Bad... Bad peeve!

02:48.211 --> 02:50.518
Oh, man, these pet peeves
are so annoying.

02:50.561 --> 02:51.867
Down! Down!

02:51.910 --> 02:53.912
Don't make me... Gah!

02:53.956 --> 02:56.176
What are we going to do?
Stop it.

02:56.219 --> 02:59.222
Give me that! Let go!

02:59.266 --> 03:02.530
How come the friend Beast Boy
does not have the pet peeve?

03:02.573 --> 03:05.402
'Cause I knows how to master
my pet peeves, mama.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.056
Ain't nothing bothers me.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.667
Well, maybe if we ignore them,
they'll go away.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.844
Hey, come on,
not on the rug. Ah!

03:12.888 --> 03:14.890
Nah, you can't just ignore 'em.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.544
And you fools better watch out

03:16.587 --> 03:19.155
because these pet peeves
is about to get way worse, yo.

03:23.290 --> 03:26.597
Did you just do the absorbing
of my pet peeve?

03:28.120 --> 03:31.298
Robin, must you do
the exercises now?

03:31.341 --> 03:32.647
I can't control it.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.475
Your pet peeve
is making me do it.

03:34.518 --> 03:37.086
I find it the very annoying.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.392
You think I'm enjoying this?

03:38.435 --> 03:39.393
The yes.

03:39.436 --> 03:40.829
Okay, maybe a little.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.397
My buns are getting
quite a workout.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.834
One and two, and one and two,

03:45.877 --> 03:47.096
and double time it now.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.402
One and two, and one and two...

03:48.445 --> 03:49.838
I think I am
going to be the sick.

to perform the public grooming.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.573
Guys, relax.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.619
None of these pet peeves

05:52.047 --> 05:54.963
You gots to learn
to master your pet peeves.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.095
And how do you expect us
to do that?

05:57.139 --> 06:00.621
First, you needs
to clear your minds.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.144
Clear our minds?

06:02.187 --> 06:04.929
It's simple, yo.
Just click the off switch.

06:12.241 --> 06:14.722
Nice. Nows all you gotta do
is train 'em with this.

06:16.724 --> 06:17.986
A pet clicker?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.379
Well, they're pets, ain't they?

06:19.422 --> 06:21.206
Sorry, Beast Boy,
but I seriously doubt

06:21.250 --> 06:23.948
a pet clicker is
going to change
our pet peeves' behavior.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.254
Sure it can.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.449
It can change anyone's behavior.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.952
Now, sit.

06:27.996 --> 06:28.910
What?

06:28.953 --> 06:30.651
Sit.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.566
Um, no.
I'm not your pet.

06:32.609 --> 06:34.263
Sit.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.265
Forget it, Beast Boy,
I'm not sitting.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.309
Sit.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.354
Knock it off.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.442
- Sit.
- No way.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.443
- Sit.
- No.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.618

07:32.277 --> 07:33.757
You mastered your pet peeves.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.367
And I even trained mine

07:35.411 --> 07:37.587
to help us track down
the PP Goblin.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.417
He's picked up a scent.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.375
Quickly, Titans,
follow his lead.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.733
Well, this is it.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.300
Are you sure
the PP Goblin is down there?

08:05.615 --> 08:08.531
Put down the book
and put your hands up.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.491
So, you've discovered
my underground lair.

08:11.534 --> 08:15.016
Too bad you'll never discover
my plan as it's too late.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.279
What is this plan
you keep teasing us about?

08:17.322 --> 08:18.323
You'll see.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.760
- When?
- Soon.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.675
- How soon?
- Soon enough.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.938
Come on, dude.
Just tell us what your plan is.

08:23.981 --> 08:26.767
No! It took me years
to come up with this plan,

08:26.810 --> 08:28.725
and I'm not about
to spoil it now.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.989
That's okay. We have ways
of making you talk.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.643
I dare you to try it.

08:33.687 --> 08:34.992
For you see,

08:35.036 --> 08:37.473
this is no ordinary hole
in the ground.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.128
This is my Pit of Peeves!

08:44.045 --> 08:46.264
Wow. This guy must have
some serious issues

08:46.308 --> 08:47.744
to have this many pet peeves.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.007
Serious issues is right.

08:50.051 --> 08:53.750
But I have mastered
all of my pet peeves.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.579
We too have mastered
our pet peeves.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.450
We'll see about that.

That was your evil plan?

10:07.258 --> 10:08.433
Yes!

10:08.477 --> 10:10.610
This ancient casserole dish

10:10.653 --> 10:13.090
is the only thing
that can withstand the heat

10:13.134 --> 10:17.138
needed to achieve
perfectly crispy hash browns.

10:17.181 --> 10:19.531
And what's so evil about that?

10:19.575 --> 10:22.230
It's evilly exquisite.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.232
And you said it was deadly.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.408
As in deadly delicious.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.542
This is delicious.
