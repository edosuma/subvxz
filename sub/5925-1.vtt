01:57.800 --> 01:59.962
Hmm.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.002
Uh-huh.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.331
Mmm.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.840
Uh-huh.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.689
Mmm.

Mmm.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.165
One, two, three.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.964
- <i>Well, congratulations.</i>
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

03:16.120 --> 03:19.567
<i>You're a guaranteed winner of one
of three fabulous prizes.</i>

03:19.760 --> 03:22.809
<i>- Have you won anything major before?
- No, never.</i>

03:22.960 --> 03:24.803
<i>- Well, you have now.
- Oh, my God.</i>

03:24.960 --> 03:27.088
<i>- Are you kidding?
- No, it's confirmed.</i>

03:27.240 --> 03:31.245
- Are you sure? Okay, what <i>did I win?</i>
- Either the Chevy Blazer, the Paris--

03:31.400 --> 03:35.962
<i>- Do you have</i> a water <i>filtration system?</i>
- <i>A faucet filter? No, sir. I don't.</i>

03:36.120 --> 03:39.647
- Do you read the papers or watch TV?
- Sometimes, yeah.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.610
Well, then you've probably
seen our advertisements.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.764
The government is gonna
make you pay a tax on the prize.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.766
But if you buy the Waterson 2000
water filtration system...

03:49.920 --> 03:53.970
...the prize gets recorded as a sales
expense, and you don't pay any tax.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.451
- Good deal, huh?
- Yeah.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.762
<i>- Yeah.
- And then I get the trip to Paris?</i>

03:57.960 --> 04:01.362
You're guaranteed one
of those three prizes.

04:01.520 --> 04:05.844
I'm gonna have a courier come to your
house. You're gonna give him a check.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.365
He's gonna come to me...

04:07.600 --> 04:11.650
...and we'll decide which one of those
prizes you get. See how that works?

04:11.800 --> 04:14.963
- How much do <i>I pay?</i>
- Three hundred ninety-eight dollars.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.647
<i>- You'd pay</i> twice that <i>in stores.
- I need</i> to <i>speak</i> to <i>my husband.</i>

04:18.959 --> 04:23.522
Irene, my supervisorjust stepped into my
office, and he would love to talk to you.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.968
Can you hold just a sec? Thanks, Irene.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.960
- Good morning.
- Who says so?

04:30.160 --> 04:32.481
Irene Fisk. She wants to talk
to her husband first.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.326
- John Goodhew, regional vice president.
- Oh.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.211
Congratulations.
Which prize are you hoping for?

04:39.360 --> 04:41.362
- Paris.
- That would be my choice too.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.046
- We've never been.
- My associate tells me...

04:44.200 --> 04:46.851
...you have five grandkids? Wow.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.641
I understand you'd like to speak
to your husband first about this.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.247
But the thing is, my secretary
is having a baby this afternoon.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.324
Everyone at the office is about
to head to the hospital.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.885
<i>Well, that's wonderful.</i>

04:59.040 --> 05:02.089
Let me confirm your address
for our courier service.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.611
<i>All right.</i>

05:09.440 --> 05:10.771
Hey.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.604
Sorry, sorry.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.248
Any thoughts on lunch?

05:16.760 --> 05:18.967
Spicy calamari?

05:19.120 --> 05:21.122
Thai food?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.846
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.561
Pygmies.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.930
Otis, hush, hush.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.968
- Can I help you?
- Carolyn Schaffer?

06:01.120 --> 06:03.327
- Yes.
- I'm Agent Kellaway. This is Agent Cole.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.482
We're from
the Federal Trade Commission.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.928
Sorry to disturb you.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.242
- Is everything all right?
- We hope so.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.088
Mrs. Schaffer, can you tell us exactly
what the man said on the phone?

06:16.240 --> 06:19.528
He said that there'd been a contest,
and I had won a prize.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.160
There'd be a drawing next week,
and I'd win...

06:22.360 --> 06:24.966
...either a Chevy Blazer,
a diamond necklace...

06:25.120 --> 06:27.771
...or a trip to Italy or France.
I don't remember.

06:27.920 --> 06:33.290
And that if I bought one of their filtration
things, I wouldn't have to pay the tax.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.125
- Jesus, Carolyn.
- I wanted to surprise you.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.969
I'm sorry to tell you this, ma'am,
but you won't be receiving any prize.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.282
I'm sorry, you've been
the victim of fraud.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.046
Otis, knock it off.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.646
It's not the newest swindle
in the world.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.686
They bait you with something bogus,
then sell you something worthless.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.650
How much did you give them,
Mrs. Schaffer?

06:57.040 --> 06:59.646
Seven hundred dollars.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.644
- What's it worth?
- At any hardware store, 50 bucks.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.689
Jesus, Carolyn.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.888
We've met people
who paid twice that.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.201
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.323
You wrote a check, ma'am?

07:10.480 --> 07:12.323
Did you mail it to them?

07:13.960 --> 07:15.962
No, a courier picked it up.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.166
- What?
- If they'd used the postal system...

07:21.360 --> 07:23.931
...it's mail fraud,
and we can go after them.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.651
Otherwise, there's not a lot we can do.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.647
- Unless...
- Unless what?

07:29.840 --> 07:32.002
Well, a lot of these whack jobs...

07:33.600 --> 07:37.650
...work in syndicates. If they cashed
your check out of state, it's federal.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.326
But we'd need a signed clearance
from you--

07:40.520 --> 07:43.729
I'll give you one if it will catch
these sons of bitches.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.850
- You have any more L-47s?
- Yeah, maybe in the car.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.729
Wait a second.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.244
Here we go.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.561
- Use my pen.
- I got one.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.847
- Would you let him out?
- Oh, sorry.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.130
Sorry.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.570
Here you go. That's right.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.210
Sorry.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.524
All we need is the name
of your bank...

08:12.040 --> 08:14.042
...your account number...

08:14.600 --> 08:17.490
...and your signature down below.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.729
- Any luck, these guys were amateurs...
- He all right?

08:23.560 --> 08:26.769
- ...cashed your check in Nevada.
- Sign there. You can date it.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.201
There you go.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.890
- You all right?
- He's fine.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.451
- Would you like some water?
- Everything's fine.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.328
Thank you for coming.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.401
You didn't take your pills, did you?

08:52.120 --> 08:57.047
- They left the door open. It was bitchen!
- it's just an open door, Roy.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.765
Well, it's not a fortune,
but it will keep me in diapers. Barely.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.083
Don't look at those drapes, man.
You should've known.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.642
Saw that guy again last night.
Chuck. Guy I was telling you about.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.087
- Guy with the--
- With the boat.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.760
Yeah, Frechette. Man, he's top-heavy.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.446
- Jesus Christ, what am I--?
- Don't say that.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.802
- Don't say what?
- You know what.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.447
Just don't say it.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.921
It's real money.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.129
If it's real money, it's long con.
I don't do long con.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.964
You haven't done it lately.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.804
Without me, Frank.

0K8)'-

09:37.360 --> 09:41.126
I'd just like to be able to take a girl
someplace nice once in a while.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.282
You have to pay extra for that?

09:43.560 --> 09:45.961
Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.203
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.520
Three, four, five, six and...

09:58.480 --> 10:00.960
...eight packs of Tareyton.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.561
That's 36. Out of 50.

10:04.720 --> 10:10.409
Thirty-seven, 38, 39, 40 and 10 is 50.
Thank you.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.845

11:18.160 --> 11:20.162
Mmm.

Mmm. Hi, this is Roy Waller calling
for Dr. Mancuso.

- He moved.
- What?

11:57.440 --> 11:59.090
<i>He doesn't live here anymore, man.</i>

11:59.280 --> 12:01.328
- What do you mean, "moved"?
- He's gone.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.370
- You're shitting me. Where'd he go?
<i>- Back east.</i>

12:04.520 --> 12:06.921
- Back <i>east?
- He owes me back rent, man.</i>

12:07.120 --> 12:10.602
Give me a contact-- Hello? Hello?

12:11.920 --> 12:15.049
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

12:37.200 --> 12:40.124
Roy, it's me. It's Frankie.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.130
<i>Come on, pick it up.
I know it's tough, but come on.</i>

12:49.240 --> 12:53.484
Roy, this is Dmitri. I met you
at that club Rage the other night.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.688

all by myself.</i>

<i>Roy, come on.</i>

13:13.520 --> 13:18.082
Roy, I wouldn't bother you, but--
Well, I'm dying, Roy.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.641
It's my spleen.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.088
I can't feel my thumbs.

<i>But seriously, I want to talk to you
because I think I've developed a rash.</i>

<i>All right, that's it. I'm coming over.</i>

Roy? Okay, I see that.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.402
I see-- I saw you. I know you're there.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.244
Come on, Roy. Really, man.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.243
One, two, three.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.842
- Take your shoes off.
- What? Why?

14:19.240 --> 14:21.481
Take your shoes off,
or you don't come in.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.688
You didn't take your pills, did you?

14:23.880 --> 14:25.882
I'm taking them off.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.010

What, did you get attacked
by Mr. Clean?

14:36.640 --> 14:39.530
- You gotta open a window, buddy.
- No! No windows.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.251
Okay. Windows are closed.
Windows are closed.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.442
You looking for something, sucker?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.602
Yeah, my partner. Have you seen him?

14:46.760 --> 14:49.445
He's been missing most of the week.
Tall guy.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.451
Hey, would you watch the rug?
You're spilling food--

14:52.920 --> 14:56.322
- You didn't take your shoes off.
- Okay, I'm taking the shoes off.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.687
I'm taking them off. See? They're off.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.489
Here you go.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.763
Oh, man, you are bad.
Did you take your pills?

15:05.960 --> 15:08.531
I spilled them down the drain
by accident.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.808
Oh, Roy, come on.
Did you call Mancuso?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.331
Moved.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.290
- You gotta be shitting me.
- That's what I said.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.562
Okay, here we go.

Hurry. Come on.

Come on, let's go. Come on. It's okay.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.125
I want you to breathe, okay?
Just keep breathing.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.526
Breathe. Okay.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.160
Okay. Okay, shoes are-- There you go.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.004
- You got food...
- What?

15:36.200 --> 15:41.730
Okay, food is gone.
I'm picking up all the food, okay?

15:42.160 --> 15:44.686
Listen to me, Roy. You listening?

15:44.880 --> 15:49.124
I'm gonna make a couple of calls. My
aunt saw this shrink after her divorce.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.011
- He really helped her. He's a good guy.
- Frank--

15:52.160 --> 15:55.369
You need to see someone.
Don't think I'm doing this for you.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.490
You got money. You can retire.
I got car payments, man.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.842
I don't need a partner who's like:

16:01.240 --> 16:03.720
My heart goes out to you,
but this is it now.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.928
Wipe that off when you're
done with it.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.323
Wipe the receiver. Just wipe it off.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.689
Okay. How's that? You like that?

16:12.840 --> 16:14.365
How's that?

16:14.520 --> 16:16.761
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.886
Do you mind if I put them up?
It helps my back.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.163
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.247
Well, you're something
of a clean slate, Roy.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.290
You were on medication,
but you don't know what kind.

17:07.640 --> 17:11.201
Yeah, okay, good. Yeah,
they were these little pink tablets.

17:11.359 --> 17:14.647
I think it said "CRC" on them.
Something like that.

17:14.839 --> 17:18.083
- You were getting them illegally?
- Yes, I was. So what?

17:18.240 --> 17:21.243
- Why?
- So I wouldn't have to talk to you.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.448
- Do you know what they were?
- Yes.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.928
At that dosage,
you're lucky to be sitting up straight.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.606
That's great.
Can you get me some more of them?

17:31.800 --> 17:34.007
- You get to the point.
- And you skirt it.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.527
- Can you get me the pills or not?
- Yes.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.968
Well, then let's get
that prescription pad out.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.767
Roy, I don't prescribe medicine unless
I've chatted with the patient.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.447
If you're inclined against that,
this session will be quite brief.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.124
Would you like to tell me
what's been bothering you?

18:17.040 --> 18:21.364
I don't like being outdoors, which
I know is called "agoraphobia." Right?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.922
Incorrectly. But, yes.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.330
- Anything else?
- Dirt. Especially around moldings.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.006
I don't like when people
put shoes on my carpet.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.687
Obviously, I have a lot of tics.
I find that very frustrating.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.249
Certain things distract me,
make me feel sick to my stomach.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.688
Have these distractions
affected your work of late?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.766
And your personal relationships?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.490
What personal relationships?

18:49.640 --> 18:52.166
When was the last time
you were in one?

18:52.400 --> 18:55.768
With a woman? A long time ago.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.604
Five years?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.446
- Ten years?
- Keep going, man.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.684
What was her name?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.525
Heather.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.009
- Were you married?
- Uh-huh.

19:10.600 --> 19:11.840
Kids?

19:12.560 --> 19:14.324
Maybe.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.289
You haven't seen her since?

19:16.800 --> 19:20.566
She left me with a black eye, which
I gave her, and a bun in the oven...

19:20.760 --> 19:23.730
...which might've come from anyone.
So, no, I haven't.

19:25.720 --> 19:29.441
Look, doc, I spent last Tuesday
watching fibers on my carpet.

19:29.640 --> 19:33.770
And the whole time I was watching my
carpet, I was worrying I might vomit.

19:33.920 --> 19:37.970
I was thinking, "I'm a grown man. I
should know what goes on in my head."

19:38.120 --> 19:39.724
The more I thought about it...

19:39.880 --> 19:43.441
...the more I realized I should
blow my brains out and end it all.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.331
But if I thought more
about blowing my brains out...

19:46.480 --> 19:50.451
...I started worrying about what
that would do to my goddamn carpet.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.085
So that was a good day, doc.

19:53.240 --> 19:57.962
And I just want you to give me some
pills and let me get on with my life.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.131
Uh-huh.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.248
- Roy.
- What?

20:11.400 --> 20:13.528
He just gave them to you at the office?

20:13.680 --> 20:16.809
He said they were new.
Prefex something-or-other.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.042
- You feel better?
- A little.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.804
You want to work soon?

20:23.080 --> 20:24.809
Think you can you control the...?

20:24.960 --> 20:27.327
- What?
- Nothing.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.369
- What <i>city, please?</i>
- Woodland Hills, California.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.761
- Name, <i>sir?</i>
- Fenton, Heather.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.651
- Can you <i>spell that?</i>
- F-E-N--

21:17.360 --> 21:21.843
<i>If that's you, then this is me.
So leave a message after the beep.</i>

21:23.000 --> 21:25.048
- Hello, this is--
- <i>Hello?</i>

21:28.560 --> 21:31.689
Well, you know, we fought a lot.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.649
- About what?
- What do you got?

21:33.800 --> 21:35.370
I wasn't sober a lot then.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.643
Are you now?

21:37.800 --> 21:40.246
So some nights,
she just didn't come home.

21:40.440 --> 21:44.729
She was pregnant two months
before she even told me about it.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.521
Yeah. Do you think about her much?

21:48.680 --> 21:52.002
You know, what could have been,
what might have been.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.570
- And the baby?
- If there's a baby.

21:57.120 --> 22:00.124
- Do you think about that?
- Sometimes. Rarely.

22:00.280 --> 22:05.889
Like, if I see a school bus, I'll wonder,
"ls one of those kids Roy Jr?"

22:06.040 --> 22:10.090
He, if he's a he, would be how old now?

22:11.280 --> 22:14.250
He'd be 14.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.130
Fourteen, ready to be a man.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.203
Yeah. If he's a he.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.402
If he is at all.

22:31.040 --> 22:34.931
Congratulations.
You bought yourself a week's worth.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.724
Thanks.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.764
Listen, doc...

22:39.960 --> 22:43.521
...do you know of a way...

22:43.680 --> 22:46.206
...just to find out, you know...

22:46.360 --> 22:49.330
There's nothing wrong
with a man telephoning his ex-wife.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.404
I tried that last night,
and I couldn't say a word.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.847
So could you call her?

22:55.760 --> 22:59.287
- I don't know, Roy. I--
- Please. It's just to find out.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.287
- Now?
- No, after I'm gone.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.928
When you can.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.850
- Okay.
- That's great.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.450
Thank you.

23:16.600 --> 23:21.447
- So I'm gonna see you on Tuesday?
- Well-- Why? I mean, I have the meds.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.604
Well, I guess that's your call.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.527
- Okay.
- Take care.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.808
Hello.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.089
<i>Roy? This is Dr. Klein.</i> l...

23:47.240 --> 23:48.401
- Hello?
- Hey.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.803
Listen, I just got off the phone
with Heather.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.689
<i>We had a very nice conversation.</i>

23:53.840 --> 23:57.322
- Does she want to speak with me?
- No, she doesn't.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.290
She didn't understand it might help
with your therapy.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.568
You told her I was in therapy.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.530
No, I told her I'm a psychiatrist.
I can't lie.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.801
<i>- Angela wants to talk to you though.
- Who?</i>

24:08.960 --> 24:10.530
<i>Angela, your daughter.</i>

24:10.680 --> 24:14.366
She knows you're her father
and says she really wants to meet you.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.360
Huh...

26:29.920 --> 26:31.285
Shit.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.565
Hey.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.485
- Angela?
- You Roy?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.531
Yeah.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.331
- So you're 14?
- Yep.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.529
So when did you get out?

27:04.720 --> 27:06.722
- What?
- Of prison.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.010
I've never been in prison.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.645
- Oh.
- Did your mom tell you that?

27:12.800 --> 27:14.689
At first she told me you were dead.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.081
Then she said you might as well be.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.567
I'm not dead. I'm in antiques.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.520
Yeah, that's what the doctor said
on the phone.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.684
When he said that,
Mom started to laugh.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.211
You hungry?

27:30.560 --> 27:31.971
Do you mind eating?

27:32.120 --> 27:35.044
It's just I'd feel better
somewhere indoors.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.880
I get uncomfortable sometimes
being outside.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.281
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.484
- You're staring.
- I'm sorry.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.881
It's okay. I used to do it too.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.726
Looked at your picture,
see if I got your nose, your eyes.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.604
Mom used to say I got lucky
and only got your elbows.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.603
Thought you weren't hungry.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.560
If you're gonna get wet,
might as well go swimming.

28:17.720 --> 28:21.770
- So you're in school, right?
- Not now. It's summer.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.604
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's right.

28:23.960 --> 28:28.010
If I had anything to do over again,
I would've worked harder in school.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.650
You drop out?

28:31.840 --> 28:34.446
That how you ended up a criminal?

28:36.920 --> 28:39.321
- I'll take it, Mike.
- Hey.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.762
It's okay, you know. Whatever you do.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.449
Everybody's done something bad
in their life.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.126
I'm in antiques.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.682
Make it a career, it's just a bunch
of something strung together.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.763
Cut the shit. I'm not a criminal.

28:52.920 --> 28:56.367
What? What was that word
you used? Shit?

28:56.520 --> 28:58.284
Hey, that--

28:58.960 --> 29:00.849
You're not supposed to talk like that.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.408
Uh... Hey, hey. He)'-

29:27.040 --> 29:29.725
- I just-- I have things a certain way.
- Okay.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.362
Wait. That's her car in the driveway.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.204
You gotta stop here. Stop!

29:41.520 --> 29:43.841
Maybe we could go bowling sometime.

29:46.880 --> 29:50.202
This is my private line.
My mom got it for my birthday...

29:50.360 --> 29:54.729
...because my friend Carrie kept calling
after midnight. Here you go.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.684
- Nice to meet you, Dad.
- Nice to meet you, Dad.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.450
Go.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.689
<i>FRANK".
What's more important than family?</i>

30:25.880 --> 30:29.965
<i>Then what could be more important than
purifying the water your family drinks?</i>

30:30.120 --> 30:34.648
The Waterson 2000 offers you the
cleanest filtration system available today.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.486
Mr. Schlickling, can you hold on
just one moment? Thank you.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.171
What?

30:41.960 --> 30:45.089
What's going on with you?
You switch shampoos or something?

30:45.360 --> 30:46.646
Those pills working?

30:47.680 --> 30:52.049
Yeah. All right.
Well, I'm glad one of us is happy.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.847
How much you think we can
take that guy for?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.571
- Chuck, with the boat.
- You serious?

30:58.240 --> 31:02.165
- I figure I owe you one.
- Oh, man, that's great!

31:02.320 --> 31:06.848
Mr. Schlick-licker? Hi, I'm sorry.
You waited too long. No prize for you.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.764
That's awesome, man!

31:09.560 --> 31:12.086
Sorry.

31:15.760 --> 31:18.001
- Where'd you find him?
- Spearmint Rhino.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.926
Watched him drop a couple G's
there a month ago.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.889
Spearmint Rhino.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.247
- That's a gentlemen's--
- I know what it is.

31:25.440 --> 31:26.680
It's right here.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.922
- What does he do?
- Import-export.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.924
- What's his last name?
- Frechette. Chuck Frechette.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.765
- How do you spell that?
- F-R...

31:34.920 --> 31:37.287
I don't know.
He's from Downey.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.488
- He's not connected, is he?
- No, no.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.608
He and the mob, they're like this:

31:43.880 --> 31:45.769
Son of a bitch didn't even tip.

31:45.960 --> 31:50.204
I figure, on short notice,
he could scratch up at least 30 grand.

31:50.360 --> 31:51.771
More.

31:52.160 --> 31:56.051
We'll pull the Jamaican switch. He
knows you, so you're rope. I'm inside.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.170
You think he knows anything
about international finance?

31:59.440 --> 32:00.851
Are you whispering?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.684
You h-.
- l amVY? 'sperms?

32:14.160 --> 32:17.209
- Hi. Safety deposit box, please.
- Sure.

32:24.640 --> 32:28.531
Hi. I'd like access
to my safety deposit box, 366, please.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.569
Certainly, Mr. Waller.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.649
Signature and pass code, please.

32:37.200 --> 32:41.046
- Would you like a booth?
- No, thanks. I'll be fine.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.244
When it's sterling versus dollars and--

33:23.600 --> 33:25.602
Nah.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.090
For some people, money is...

33:30.240 --> 33:33.722
Money is a foreign film without subtitles.

- Where do you want to meet?</i>

33:41.000 --> 33:43.128

Where else? The Rhino.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.327
<i>OKHY-</i>

33:44.480 --> 33:45.766

33:47.240 --> 33:48.651
I gotta go.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.565
- Remember me?
- You just in the neighborhood?

34:09.719 --> 34:13.088
Took the bus.
Think I could come in a sec?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.081
- Nice!
- One, two, three.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.884
It's nice, your place.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.202
Could you watch the carpet, please?

34:21.679 --> 34:23.170
Sorry.

34:28.280 --> 34:31.443
Could you please take your shoes off?

34:31.600 --> 34:33.170
Oh, yeah, sorry.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.004
So, what's going on?

34:35.159 --> 34:38.527
Mom and I had sort of a fight.
Happens once in a while.

34:38.719 --> 34:41.690
I usually take off for a day or two
to let her calm down.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.002
- Take off?
- Normally, I go to Carrie's...

34:44.159 --> 34:45.730
...only she's on vacation.

34:45.880 --> 34:49.362
And I thought, since we seemed
to hit it off so well last time...

34:49.560 --> 34:53.007
...I could sleep on your couch.

34:53.239 --> 34:54.889
You want to stay here?

34:55.040 --> 34:58.249
Well, I could pay you back
by cleaning up or something.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.686
Uh...

34:59.960 --> 35:02.440
- Do you wear those to read?
- What?

35:02.600 --> 35:03.647
They make you look old.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.164
Oh, no, these are for...

35:06.320 --> 35:09.324
I gotta go!
I got a big business meeting.

35:09.480 --> 35:12.643
- This late?
- Antiques, they wait for no man.

35:15.080 --> 35:18.482
Is it all right if I leave
you here alone?

35:18.640 --> 35:21.007
Sure, I can just watch TV.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.330
- You don't have a TV?
- Well...

35:24.480 --> 35:26.209
Seriously? You don't have a TV?

35:26.360 --> 35:28.761
There's a couch, if you want to sit.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.521
Or over there, if you prefer.
Or the couch.

35:34.120 --> 35:37.567
Do you want me to pick you up
something on the way back?

35:37.720 --> 35:41.406
- Like, what is it, ice cream, right?
- Sure.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.689
New York Super Fudge Chunk.
That's my favorite flavor.

35:44.840 --> 35:48.128
- New York...
- Super Fudge Chunk.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.601
Chocolate, yeah.
Okay, now listen...

35:50.760 --> 35:54.651

35:58.360 --> 36:00.362
One, two, three.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.402
All right!

36:23.880 --> 36:25.166
Here, sweetie.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.845
Wow.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.202
Yeah, all right.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.051
Here we go, babe.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.010
- Bob, good to see you!
- Arden, hope I didn't keep you.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.288
- There. He missed you coming in.
- What?

37:16.440 --> 37:19.171
Over there. He missed you coming in.

37:20.840 --> 37:24.208
- Hey, Kate! Can I get a beer? A Heinie?
- Sure.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.131
- Thanks. That do the trick?
- Let's sit.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.327
I told you you were gonna like it here.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.171
No way!

37:53.080 --> 37:54.491
Here you go, sweetie.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.166
- Love them shoes, girl.
- Thank you, baby.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.526
Hey, Bob!

38:00.240 --> 38:02.846
Hey, Chuck, I didn't know
you were here.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.004
Hey, Chuck Frechette, this is Arden--

38:06.160 --> 38:07.685
Hiya.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.724
Um...

38:12.000 --> 38:13.490
Hey...

38:15.880 --> 38:17.769
I gotta do business,
you mind if...?

38:17.920 --> 38:21.003
Sure, Bob. I didn't mean to--
Sorry. I'll be--

38:21.160 --> 38:24.164
- Nice meeting you. I'll be over here.
- Great.

38:26.720 --> 38:28.722
That's fish in a barrel.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.210
He's piqued. You good to go?

38:36.040 --> 38:38.611
- Does the pope poo in the woods?
- Just say yes.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.483
- I'll see you, Bob.
<i>- I'll</i> see you in the morning, Arden.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.202
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:56.720 --> 39:00.441
- Big night planned.
- Oh, it's not for me.

39:01.080 --> 39:04.846
- Right. That's $12.73.
- Okay.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.406
Out of 15.

39:07.480 --> 39:11.644
Thirteen, 14, 15.
You got kids overnight?

39:46.800 --> 39:50.122
Roy? Why did Mom leave you?

39:50.800 --> 39:53.451
Well, you'd have to ask her that.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.605
I did. She said she didn't
wanna talk about it.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.807
Called you names.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.647
That's why we got in a fight.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.210
She said you were a bad guy.

40:08.960 --> 40:13.124
- You don't seem like a bad guy.
- That's what makes me good at it.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.121
Well, I don't think you're a bad guy.

40:27.640 --> 40:28.971
Good night.

40:29.800 --> 40:30.847
Good night.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.681
Someone's in here!

40:59.840 --> 41:03.606
I think it's disrespectful.
I just think it's disrespectful.

41:10.600 --> 41:14.002
- Hey, come on.
- One, two, three.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.730
I wish you could've been there.
I reeled him in, man.

41:17.880 --> 41:21.362
- Hallelujah! You got a chick in there?
- What are you doing?

41:21.520 --> 41:23.284
What's the hubbub?

41:23.440 --> 41:26.842
The second you left the place,
he was off his barstool. He's in.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.520
- He's in. He wants to meet tonight.
- All right.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.284
Push it till tomorrow.

41:32.440 --> 41:35.569
Let his greed meet his imagination.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.247
Morning.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.245
Good morning.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.089
I made you eggs.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.244
That's okay.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.326
So who was that guy
who came by earlier?

41:53.520 --> 41:54.567
Business associate.

41:55.400 --> 41:56.970
Well, what was his name?

41:57.480 --> 41:58.811
Frank.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.122
How come you didn't want him
to see me?

42:01.280 --> 42:03.521
It's not that I don't want him to see--

42:03.680 --> 42:07.287
Don't you think you should eat eggs
for breakfast? Something healthy.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.010
I don't like eggs.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.084
Anyways, all you've got here is tuna.
Lots of tuna.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.841
And one TV dinner?

42:15.000 --> 42:19.244
TV dinners are cool.
You should get the TV to go with them.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.730
I like tuna fish.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.530
Hi, Mom. No.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.085
No.

42:32.240 --> 42:36.325
So what if I am?
So? He's my father.

42:36.640 --> 42:40.087
Well, I don't care.
I don't care!

42:40.560 --> 42:43.006
Well, I Will if I Want!

42:44.240 --> 42:46.766
No. I know.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.605
Okay, I promise.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.444
Okay, bye.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.089
She mad?

42:53.760 --> 42:56.491
- At me, not you.
- Oh.

43:00.600 --> 43:04.286
- She said she was gonna call the police.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.043
But now she just wants me home
in time for summer school.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.001
When's that start?

43:10.920 --> 43:12.126
Monday.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.122
Today's Thursday.

43:16.560 --> 43:17.971
That's okay, isn't it?

43:18.840 --> 43:23.528
Uh... Huh...

43:24.680 --> 43:26.967
Uh...

43:28.000 --> 43:29.331
--three, four.

43:30.760 --> 43:32.728
Let it out. Good, very good.

43:32.920 --> 43:34.922
You've got stains on your carpet.

43:35.080 --> 43:38.163
Is that what you were
thinking about, stains on my carpet?

43:38.480 --> 43:39.641
You can sit up.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.163
Yeah, carpet stains...

43:43.320 --> 43:47.484
...and that I have a 14-year-old girl
I barely know living in my house.

43:47.680 --> 43:49.842
Trust me, they're not so difficult, kids.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.766
You have to make sure
they eat their vegetables...

43:52.920 --> 43:55.924
...don't stay up too late,
don't watch too much TV.

43:56.360 --> 43:59.842
Otherwise, just try to be as honest
and open with them as possible.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.810
- Honest and open with them as possible.
- Right?

44:02.960 --> 44:04.200
Right!

44:17.720 --> 44:20.291
<i>I need a <i>check okay on three.</i></i>

44:20.440 --> 44:23.683
<i>Manager for a check okay on three,
please.</i>

44:23.960 --> 44:25.803
The line for that one's shorter.

44:25.960 --> 44:28.042
No, this one's better.

44:30.520 --> 44:34.650
<i>We need a price check
on a five-pound bag of Red Delicious.</i>

44:36.800 --> 44:38.040
Dad, hurry! Hurry!

44:38.200 --> 44:40.282
Pygmies!

44:40.440 --> 44:41.726
We're making spaghetti.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.530
Yeah. Happy times. Happy times.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.890
Here it comes.

44:51.080 --> 44:55.927
The chefs in Italy say the spaghetti's
ready if you throw it and it sticks.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.246
- Voila'.
- Yay!

44:58.400 --> 45:00.926
Beer. Uh...

45:01.080 --> 45:03.401
- Cheers.
- Uh...

45:04.320 --> 45:06.402
I don't know.

45:09.840 --> 45:13.162
- No sauce to go over it?
- It's spaghetti alio <i>olio!</i>

45:13.400 --> 45:16.927
And it's got basil leaves in it.
See the leaves?

45:21.520 --> 45:22.931
Enjoy it.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.643
- Hi.
- Walters?

45:28.800 --> 45:30.768
Waller. Keep the change.

45:36.440 --> 45:38.124
I'm happy now.

45:51.600 --> 45:54.206
- You don't want something?
- I gotta fly in two hours.

45:54.360 --> 45:55.725
- Where to?
- Phoenix.

45:55.880 --> 45:58.611
A client's opening an account
to bridge the pound and Euro.

45:58.760 --> 46:01.491
I gotta hold his hand.
Would you please heat this up?

46:01.640 --> 46:02.721
- That bad?
- Yeah.

46:02.880 --> 46:06.123
For some folks, money is a foreign film
without subtitles.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.245
- To the business at hand.
- To the business at hand.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.801
I have one rule, Chuck. Simple is safe.

46:13.960 --> 46:16.804
I'll tell you as little as possible
about what I do...

46:17.000 --> 46:21.164
...but as much as I need to to make you
comfortable with what we're doing.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.560
What are we doing?

46:26.920 --> 46:30.686
Five thousand pounds sterling.
A perk of working in exchange at a bank.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.730
- Whose is it?
- No one's.

46:32.920 --> 46:36.811
Just money unaccounted for, floating on
top of the books like a layer of cream.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.928
And he just scoops it off.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.481
Well, it's a little more-- Bob!

46:41.680 --> 46:45.207
It's a little more complicated than that,
but again, simple is safe.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.966
- Why not keep it?
- As a bank employee...

46:48.200 --> 46:51.522
...any attempt to change currency
is recorded and questioned.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.967
Bob has a record.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.407
You, on the other hand,
no one bats an eye.

46:56.560 --> 46:59.040
Now, I hope you have something
for me.

46:59.240 --> 47:01.447
- Five grand, American.
- Congratulations.

47:01.600 --> 47:07.289
- At today's exchange rate you made--
- $2567. Looked it up on the Internet.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.521
He's fast.

47:09.760 --> 47:13.048
That Internet thing, that's a fad.
I can't figure it out.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.089
Me neither, but my daughter's a wiz.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.567
- You have a daughter?
- Two. Fifteen and 12.

47:17.720 --> 47:19.165
Wonderful, I have a 14-year-old.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.446
- It's a riot, huh?
- Yeah.

47:20.600 --> 47:23.285
Little training bras hanging
from the shower rods.

47:23.480 --> 47:25.448
- And everything smells like gum.
- it does.

47:25.600 --> 47:28.490
How do you get them outside?
Mine sits at home all day.

47:28.640 --> 47:30.324
Summer is the worst. The worst.

47:30.480 --> 47:33.643
- It's crazy. It's wild.
- He sounds just like him.

47:33.800 --> 47:37.168
Let me ask you something, Arden.
How much could you do this for?

47:37.320 --> 47:39.561
Well, as a rule, we never go north of 10.

47:39.720 --> 47:42.326
How much could you get
your hands on?

47:44.240 --> 47:45.651
- A lot.
- All right.

47:46.840 --> 47:48.569
- Put it there.
- Let's play ball.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.331
- Chucky, baby, give me some sugar.
- Yeah.

47:51.480 --> 47:53.403
See you later? Peace. Two fingers.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.611
Peace?

47:56.760 --> 47:58.171
- Asshole.
- Didn't tip him?

47:58.320 --> 48:00.004
- Did it again.
- Tickets.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.605
Yeah, he's a jackass.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.406
See you, jackass.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.923
Man, I thought we were out
2 grand there for a second.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.765
You gotta spend money
if you wanna make money.

48:10.920 --> 48:12.570
You gotta make it to spend it.

48:12.720 --> 48:16.770
"Everything smells like gum"?
What was that about?

48:19.440 --> 48:21.124
It's easier if I show you.

48:22.280 --> 48:23.964
Angela?

48:25.960 --> 48:27.962
Angela, I'm back.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.886
Angela, Frank's here!

48:31.640 --> 48:33.085
Hey.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.130
Angela?

48:37.440 --> 48:40.205
She's not here.
She must have gone back to her mom's.

48:40.360 --> 48:45.048
This teenybopper Hillary says,
"I am single, baby."

48:45.280 --> 48:47.965
- Where does she usually go?
- I don't know.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.771
This is no good, Roy.
It's no good for you or us.

48:50.920 --> 48:52.809
It's got nothing to do with us.

48:52.960 --> 48:55.042
- Hey!
'PYQmies.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.480
Yeah.

48:57.720 --> 49:01.520
- This is bad news, man.
- You don't have to put it like that.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.725
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

49:55.880 --> 49:57.723
Okay. Where did you go?

49:57.880 --> 50:01.441
I just went out. I went to the arcade.
It's like a half a mile away.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.082
It's stuffy in here.
It smells like Lysol.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.890
Where the hell were you?

50:06.040 --> 50:08.441
I wanna know right now
or I'm calling your mother!

50:08.600 --> 50:11.649
I just told you. I went to the arcade.

50:12.080 --> 50:13.969
Why did you sneak back in?

50:14.120 --> 50:17.647
That's how I left.
I didn't have keys to lock the door.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.450
So you didn't see my car?

50:20.680 --> 50:22.170
Jeez, you're worse than Mom.

50:22.440 --> 50:27.731
Angela, listen, I'm glad I met you,
I really am, but I've got a business...

50:27.880 --> 50:32.090
...and I've got a partner and I've got
things a certain way, and that's it!

50:32.240 --> 50:34.766
So, you know, I think it'd be better...

50:35.760 --> 50:39.321
...for you, most of all, if tomorrow
morning I took you back home.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.691
- What did I do wrong?
- You didn't do anything wrong.

50:42.840 --> 50:46.970
I just went out! God, I didn't even--
I didn't drink, I didn't get high!

50:47.560 --> 50:49.961
I didn't take any money
from your stupid dog!

50:52.160 --> 50:55.164
- What, you never heard of a bank?
- Uh...

50:55.960 --> 50:57.450
Uh...

50:57.600 --> 51:00.171
That is wrong what you did, and...

51:00.320 --> 51:02.607
...you're a Nosy Parker, and...

51:02.760 --> 51:05.923
And that's no way for
a young lady to behave!

51:06.440 --> 51:08.044
Shame on you!

51:21.360 --> 51:22.930
Angela?

51:23.800 --> 51:25.643
Sweetheart?

51:25.960 --> 51:29.282
- I wasn't kicking you out.
- I won't stay where I'm not wanted!

51:29.480 --> 51:31.960
- It's not that I don't want you.
- Fooled me.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.646
- Will you stop?
- Don't! Let me go!

51:35.600 --> 51:40.481
You don't want me going home to Mom
thinking she was right all along! Stop!

51:41.680 --> 51:43.967
You're just like one of her boyfriends!

51:44.160 --> 51:46.686
I'm just something you have
to deal with to screw her!

51:46.880 --> 51:51.807
- Please, you know that's not true.
- They tell me what they do for a living!

51:52.000 --> 51:57.166
Antiques dealers keep large stacks of
cash in their homes next to their guns.

51:57.320 --> 52:02.326
Okay. Okay. All right?
I'm sorry. It's just...

52:03.480 --> 52:05.209
I'm not...

52:05.360 --> 52:09.445
I'm not very good at being a dad.
Okay? You know? All right?

52:09.640 --> 52:12.325
I barely get by being me.

52:13.280 --> 52:14.850
- Sweetheart, please--
- Don't!

52:15.160 --> 52:18.369
Come on back home with me,
and we can get a big pizza again.

52:18.520 --> 52:22.047
You can stay the whole weekend
if you want, all right?

52:26.800 --> 52:28.848
Why do you have a gun?

52:36.160 --> 52:37.286
In case.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.886
In case what?

52:42.920 --> 52:45.446
It's, it's... It's hard to explain.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.724
Waller. Keep the change.

52:55.760 --> 52:56.886
- Bullshit!
- Nope.

52:57.040 --> 53:00.931
No bullshit.
And watch your language at the table.

53:01.080 --> 53:03.560
- You're a con man?
- Con artist.

53:03.960 --> 53:07.567
A flimflam man, matchstick man, loser.
Whatever you want to call it.

53:07.720 --> 53:08.960
And that guy, Frank?

53:09.160 --> 53:12.562
He's my partner. My protégé.

53:13.160 --> 53:15.003
- Teach me something.
- What?

53:15.160 --> 53:17.242
- Teach me a con.
- You're funny.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.483
No, come on, really!
Teach me something.

53:22.560 --> 53:24.927
- I'm not teaching you anything.
- Why not?

53:25.080 --> 53:27.481
You're a bright, innocent,
beautiful girl...

53:27.680 --> 53:30.650
...and I'm not gonna screw that up
like everything else.

53:31.680 --> 53:32.920
Really?

53:33.640 --> 53:36.484
- What?
- You think that?

53:36.920 --> 53:38.763
That I'm beautiful?

53:39.040 --> 53:40.565
No.

53:42.600 --> 53:45.001
Then why won't you?
Because crime doesn't pay?

53:45.200 --> 53:48.443
No, it does. It does.
Just not very well.

53:48.760 --> 53:50.762
- You seem to be doing okay.
- I'm not.

53:51.240 --> 53:54.005
Believe me, it's no fun doing what I do.

53:54.160 --> 53:57.050
It's usually stealing from people
who don't deserve it.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.965
Old people, fat people. Lonely.

54:00.120 --> 54:02.327
A lot of the time, I feel sick about it.

54:05.120 --> 54:07.043
Then why do you do it?

54:17.280 --> 54:20.648
I'm not as innocent as you think.
I've done stuff with boys.

54:21.400 --> 54:25.041
I've done stuff with boys,
if I told you...

54:25.240 --> 54:27.368
...you'd throw up.
- Then don't tell me.

54:27.520 --> 54:30.330
- Then teach me something!
- No! Final.

54:31.960 --> 54:35.806
At the Christmas dance last year,
I went with this boy Josh Ward.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.209
- He's cute, and I really liked him.
- I'm not listening.

54:39.360 --> 54:44.002
After the dance, we went to Carrie's,
and he pushed me against the bed...

54:44.160 --> 54:46.367
- Not listening!
- ...and he took his hand--

54:46.520 --> 54:49.205
- No! Okay. I'll show you one thing!
- You will?

54:51.000 --> 54:52.729
Thank you, thank you!

54:52.880 --> 54:54.405
- All right, okay--
- Thank you!

54:54.600 --> 54:59.527
But then you're never gonna do it again,
and you're gonna forget it. Agreed?

55:02.080 --> 55:03.241
Holy Mary.

55:03.600 --> 55:06.080
Never work near where you live.

55:06.280 --> 55:08.282
Don't shit--

55:08.440 --> 55:11.205
Don't write anything down.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.725
All right, I want you
to stay in the car, okay?

55:25.400 --> 55:27.050
Hey! Would you stay in the car?

55:44.120 --> 55:47.124
I'd like to play this
for the drawing on the 22nd.

55:54.040 --> 55:58.568
You know the odds of the same numbers
hitting in the same month? Or ever?

55:58.880 --> 56:01.565
Well, that's why I changed one.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.451
You're wasting your dollar.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.649
Hey. You his financial adviser? No.

56:07.080 --> 56:11.608
You're a cashier at a convenience store.
Take his dollar and give him a ticket.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.447
- You're ready for this.
- I was born ready.

56:16.920 --> 56:19.082
Glad I missed that day.

56:25.120 --> 56:28.522
Okay. The most important thing
to understand about this game is...

56:28.680 --> 56:30.603
...ninety percent of it is variable.

56:30.760 --> 56:34.526
No matter how good a plan is,
you almost always get thrown a curve.

56:34.680 --> 56:37.809
So you gotta be flexible,
prepared to roll with anything.

56:37.960 --> 56:39.291
- I'll do it.
- The 2.

56:39.600 --> 56:43.047
The one thing you can control, though,
is who your mark is.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.965
Never play someone who isn't
buying what you're selling.

56:46.120 --> 56:49.966
You're thinking, "What am I selling?"
What you're selling is you.

56:50.120 --> 56:54.489
The older the better. Beware of couples.
Only you whisper in your mark's ear.

56:54.680 --> 56:59.811
For God's sake, make sure the person
you're conning isn't conning you.

57:00.360 --> 57:02.966
That's good. All right.
Let's go kick some butt.

57:06.480 --> 57:09.211
- This taken?
- No.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.961
You sure? You've got a lot.

57:12.360 --> 57:17.321
This is nothing. You ought to catch me
during Little League season. Three boys.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.323
- Any of them cute?
- Uh-huh.

57:20.400 --> 57:24.291
Simon's about your age. Though
you'd never guess. He's so hyper.

57:25.400 --> 57:28.210
- I'm gonna get a soda. Want anything?
- No, thanks.

57:32.880 --> 57:35.724
Oh, honey. You dropped something.

57:39.480 --> 57:41.482
- Not mine.
- You sure?

57:41.680 --> 57:43.091
You gotta be 18 to play.

57:44.120 --> 57:47.010
Looks like someone put it
through the wash by accident.

57:47.160 --> 57:49.845
Yesterday's drawing.
That looks like the second.

57:50.960 --> 57:52.928
Probably a loser.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.610
Yeah.

58:12.360 --> 58:15.523
We should at least see if it hit.

58:18.960 --> 58:21.930
Excuse me, sir.
Can we borrow your paper for a sec?

58:22.080 --> 58:25.129
- We're just looking for lottery results.
- Yeah, okay.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.601
Metro, isn't it? Here.

58:27.760 --> 58:29.091
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

58:31.480 --> 58:34.165
- Let's see. There it is. Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

58:34.360 --> 58:37.603
- Six, 18, 30, 49--
- Wait. Six, 18, What?

58:37.760 --> 58:40.969
Sorry. Thirty, 49, 60.

58:41.240 --> 58:44.244
- Missed by one.
- Oh, you're joking!

58:44.720 --> 58:47.690
- Story of my life.
- Mine too.

58:47.840 --> 58:50.923
- Any luck?
- Four out of five. Can you believe that?

58:51.080 --> 58:53.526
Four out of five?
Four out of five pays.

58:53.680 --> 58:55.091
- It does?
- Sure, yeah.

58:55.240 --> 58:57.561
Call the number on the back
of the ticket.

58:59.360 --> 59:00.441
Well, thanks!

59:01.400 --> 59:02.765
Uh-huh.

59:03.400 --> 59:07.200
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

59:08.120 --> 59:11.283
- Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
- What did they say?

59:13.360 --> 59:17.410
We won $600!

59:18.000 --> 59:21.846
- Holy shit!
- Holy moly! Six hundred dollars!

59:24.160 --> 59:25.207
Couple of winners.

59:25.360 --> 59:30.002
The woman said we just take it down for
verification, and they'll mail me a check.

59:30.160 --> 59:33.130
We should call your mom
and we can all go down together.

59:33.280 --> 59:36.363
- It's okay, I'm supposed to be home.
- No, no, no.

59:36.520 --> 59:39.285
We're in this 50-50.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.643
Good girl.

59:52.720 --> 59:54.484
Watch the cameras.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.164
That's it.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.010
Three hundred dollars.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.882
Don't spend it all at the coin-op.
Hide it when you get home.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.084
Bye.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.008
- Did I do good?
- You did...

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.321
You did very good.
Very, very, very good.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.047
See? Mom was wrong.
I didn't just get your elbows.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.450
- Well, there's one last thing.
- What?

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.251
- I want you to give her the money back.
- What?

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.291
I told you I'd teach you a con,
I didn't say I'd let you get away with it.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.805
What am I supposed to say?

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.681
Judging by that last performance,
I'm sure you'll think of something.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.529
This is so...

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.490
Angela, I would not be
a responsible father...

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.042
...if I let you get away with this.
Let's go!

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.602
I mean, it's strange. Two weeks ago,
this was ancient history.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.808
Now, all of a sudden...

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.564
...I have a daughter!

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.208
And I'm not scared shitless.
That's good, isn't it?

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.244
- It's however you feel about it, Roy.
- Yeah.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.641
Yes, it's wonderful.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.408
Don't take this too literally, but you've
been closing doors for a long time.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.530
It's good to see you
start opening some again.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.049
What?

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.568
I took Angela along with me
over the weekend, selling a piece.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.040
And sometimes in my business...

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.762
...you have to create a value
for something which really isn't there.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.403
Some people call it sales,
but other people call it...

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.686
- Lying.
- Right. Which is a little...

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.169
I wasn't sure how Angela
would go for it, but she took to it.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.011
Like a duck to water.
She even helped out.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.447
You know, this 14-year-old girl...

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.481
...working these people with me.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.483
Working them, doc.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.929
Do you regret it? Exposing her to that?
Her seeing that side of you?

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.409
Well, you know, it was a little--
It made me feel-- I was a little--

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.324
I really liked it.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.482
It was the best time we've had together.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.964
Right.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.329
- Fabulous cup trick.
- You like that?

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.361
He wants to fly the money to the
Caymans. Afraid he might get robbed.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.370
As if somebody would do that.
When's his flight?

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.090
Friday. What do you think?

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.403
About the hat? It's a little
Dwight Yoakam around the edges.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.530
- You're calling attention to yourself.
- Chicks dig it.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.490
So where do you think?

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.847
Where do you want to do it?

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.201
There.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.881
I'm here. He sits there.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.248
Back to the bar.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.085
Back to the bar. It's important.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.004
Otherwise, we blow it off.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.444
Okay.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.327
- Who's it going to be?
- Ernie.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.369
Hobo Ernie?

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.409
Yeah, homeless Ernie.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.162
- He's a little over the top, isn't he?
- For 50 bucks, it's a hell of a bargain.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.322
Okay, okay.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.209
- There's only one problem.
- What?

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.291
I think I'm in love with you.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.966
- We're gonna be rich.
- Do not do that.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.248
That's embarrassing.
Just stop.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.529
- Does it turn you on?
- No, it does not turn me on. Stop.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.767
Can you--?

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.730
Here you go.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:45.124
- Where's that cute little girl of yours?
- She went home to her mom's.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.410
Summer school.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.210
She's a cute one.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.165
Must be lonesome without her.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.327
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Hi.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.484
- It's Kathy, right?
- Yeah.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.450
- I'm Roy.
- Hi, Roy.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.051
- How are you?
- I'm doing all right.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.884
<i>ANGELA". Hi, Dad, it's me.
I just wanted to say hi.</i>

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.444
<i>Summer school sort of sucks.
I get out at noon on Wednesday.</i>

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.281
<i>I'll meet you out in front
if you want. Okay. Bye.</i>

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.329
<i>Hi, Dad, it's me.
I just wanted to say hi.</i>

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.211
- Pervert.
- Get in the car.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.201
What would you like to do today,
little girl?

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.880
- Mom wants me home by dinner.
- You'll be back.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.281
What would you like to do?

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.208
What? Oh-oh.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.044
- I own you.
- Oh, yeah?

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.850
We'll just have to see about that.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.042
Let me show you a little something
I learned in Taiwan.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.281
Okay.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.165
- What?
- Dad...

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.727
...the first thing you need
to understand...

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.929
...is 90 percent of it is knocking down
at least one pin.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.088
Oh, is that right? Is that right?

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.521
Not now!

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.130
- You want me to bowl for you?
- Yeah, I'll just be a couple of minutes.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.249
- You'll be all right?
- Yeah.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.243
All right.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.044
This better be pretty important.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.168
<i>- Bad news, he bumped it up.
- What?</i>

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.800
- We gotta do it today.
- I thought it was Friday.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.962
Me too, but he changed it.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.690
<i>- We gotta do it now.</i>
- Tell him!

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.650
What am I gonna tell him?
We can't postpone it.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.407
<i>He's leaving for the Caymans
for a month. We've gotta do it now.</i>

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.451
There's no time. I gotta get the money,
get changed, get Ernie--

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.171
I know, I know.
But we got no choice.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.004
What time is his flight?

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.764
Roy.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.686
<i>- Roy?
- Shit.</i>

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.326
Your turn.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.570
I'm sorry, I gotta take you home.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.961
I can't do this. There's no time.
I can't even take you home.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.169
- Do you want me to take the bus?
- No, no. Shit!

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.761
Is it a job?

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.926
Can I help?

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.644
Get in.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:27.767
I thought you kept your money
in the dog.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.845
That's just my piggy bank.
All right, I want you to wait here.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.850
- Hi, safety deposit box, please.
- Of course.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.890
I'd like to access
safety deposit box 366.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.127
Signature and pass code, please.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.845
- Why can't I see?
- Because it's secret.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.765
Then why does she get to?

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.604
Can I add an access signature
to my account?

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.330
Certainly.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.725
- Sign here and here.
- Do it.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.207
Now can I get into
the whatever-it-is?

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.362
No, you don't have the pass code.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.046
- When do I get that?
- When I'm dead.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.042
You wait here.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.362
I mean it.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.366
- Booth?
- No! No! No booth!

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.247
- So how much is in there?
- I told you.

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:54.163
No, in there!

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.924
Three hundred thousand?

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.684
Five hundred thousand?

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.247
A million?

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.571
Oh, my God!
How did you get that money?

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.489
I've been doing this a long time.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.248
Why aren't you--?
Why don't you go live in Hawaii?

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.768
- Why don't you go buy Hawaii?
- I don't like the outdoors.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.722
You know what to do, right?
Keep real far away from us.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.724
- Anything goes off, you get out of there.
- Yeah.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.324
Hand me a gold wedding ring,
sweetheart.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.767
Thank you.
These still make me look old?

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.127
Old and rich.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.648
Okay, you remember your cue, right?

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.246
- That's your cue. Then you enter.
- I know.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.290
Okay. Okay, let's do this.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.124
And just in case, take this,
will you?

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.729
Stop worrying about me.
I'm barely even doing anything.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.485
I went out with her,
but afterwards I was pretty toasted.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.644
- Does she have any sisters?
- I don't know.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.408
Hey. Hey.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.689
- Arden, you okay?
- it's my back. I strained it last night.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.802
- Oh, man. I told you, you gotta do yoga.
- I was doing yoga.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.970
Do you mind if I sit there?
The high back helps.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.009
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.203
Oh, Lord.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.848
- How are both of you?
- Fabulous. So who goes first?

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:00.962
I suppose ladies do.
The queen before Ben Franklin.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.283
- That's 80,000?
- Yeah.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:19.890
- Looks like a lot less than I thought.
- It always does. it always does.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.201
Sorry. I had to check.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.403
As long as you don't mind.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.848
No, no. Do your worst.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.688
It's been counted?

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.161
Gentlemen, looks like we have a trade.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.448
- God bless America.
- Land that I love.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.161
Enjoy the Caymans,
and don't get too much sun.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.961
Come on, I'm 21!
My ID is in my luggage!

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.241
My plane doesn't leave
for 30 minutes, give--

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.928
Don't touch me! You touch me,
I'll break every glass in this place!

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.081
Hey, airport bartender!

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.608
Hope she's not on my flight.

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.842
Speaking of which,
it's about that time.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.444
So who goes first?

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:16.605
You do. You just get up
and take your new briefcase with you.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.491
When I leave, I'll take my new gym bag.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.050
- Simple is safe.
- Simple is safe.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.602
Guys.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.683
- Have a safe flight.
- Thank you.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.087
- Take care.
- Let's do it again.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.810
You have my word on that.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.441
- Go with him. Walk him to the plane.
- What?

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.046
- Walk him to the plane!
- They won't let you.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.443
Then walk him to the security check.
Now. Go. Now!

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.604
Did you see that old chick
at the bar with the makeup?

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.762
- Yeah, I saw her.
- She almost died...

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.809
...when I threw that glass.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.923
- So, what happened? You take him?
- Yeah.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.730
- The whole 80?
- Uh-huh.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.483
My dad's a smooth operator!

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.530
Dad, I thought about it. We should
give the money back. I'd feel better.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.883
- Yeah.
- Just kidding.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.407
- Do I get a cut?
- Ask Frank for his.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.170
Dad! Dad!

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.085
Get out of the car,
you lousy, two-bit con!

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.087
- Get out of the car!
- What are you doing?

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.683
Give me my money!
Give me my money!

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.926
- You stinking little runt!
- Roll up the window!

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.686
Give me my money, you bitch!
Stinking, little--

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.444
- Get down!
- My money!

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.888
- Roll up the window!
- You piece of shit!

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.567
Goddamn it!

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.769
In this situation, it's very important
to remain calm.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.450
I'm so sorry.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.683
- Which one? Which one?
- The middle one! The middle one.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.966
Or this one.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.646
That one! That one!

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.881
Come on, come on! Come on!

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.249
- Here you go.
- Can I get a receipt?

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.970
- I can get you one.
- Let's go!

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.406
Hurry!

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.688
You saved a receipt for a hamburger?

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.927
Come on!

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:38.766
- I understand that.
- Just breathe. Breathe.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.321
Save that tax. Have a great day.
Thank you.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.846
- Keep the change.
- We can't accept gratuity.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.166
It's kindness.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.245
Thanks for being kind, but we're
not allowed. Please, take the change.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.090
Let's go, come on!

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.130
- Five, 6, 7, 8...
- Hurry, he's coming!

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.608
10, 11, 12...
- He's coming!

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.604
- Are you out of your mind?
- Sir! Excuse me!

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.525
You stay in the car.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.806
What's wrong?

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.721
Stay in the car!

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.802
Hi, cutie-pie.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.445
- Where did you get the...?
- What did you do?

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.726
I told you--

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:05.043
I said walk him to the plane!
Did you walk him to the plane?

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.441
You can't get to the gate
without a ticket!

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.768
Did you see him go through security--?

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.764
My daughter was there today!

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.843
- I'm not the one who pimped her--
- What?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.844
I'm not the one who pimped her
into the fucking grift!

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.924
I'm not the one who put her at risk.
She put us at risk!

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.526
- How?
- What if he goes to the cops?

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.286
- He won't. They never do.
- What if he does?

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.444
He'd have to explain
what he's doing with a briefcase...

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.802
...With $80,000 cash in it...

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.367
...and a ticket to the Caymans, okay?

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.641
We're not on the books. We're safe.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.047
I know we are. What about her?

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.240
Angela's never been arrested, all right?

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.921
You don't know that.
You don't know that.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.602
Turn it off.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:11.088
All right, let's get this over with.
Tell him you're clean.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.248
You've never been arrested, have you?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.082
That's terrific. That's great.

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.847
That's beautiful.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.531
Frank.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.329
Here's the money. Give me a call.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.930
Jesus Christ.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.771
You're 14! When did you
have time to get arrested?

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.288
I forgot to pay for a pack of gum once.
That's it.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.650
So they called the cops on you
over a pack of gum?

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.926
And some other stuff.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.449
I might have put up a fuss
when security...

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.806
Angela!

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.970
The guard was groping me.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.806
He was grabbing at my chest.
What was I supposed to do?

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.921
- How long ago?
- Last year.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.129
The)' Ph0t0graphed you?
They printed you?

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.487
Move your leg.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:34.807
I have all of August off. I was
thinking I could come visit you.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.769
We could take a trip, even.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.402
In September is fathers' visiting day
at school. It's lame, but--

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.487
Yeah, well, I'll be gone
for the next couple of months.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.769
Frank and I have some
out-of-town work, so...

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.771
- When do you think you'll be back?
- I don't know, actually.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.921
- Maybe when you get back--
- Okay, look.

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.367
You're getting in the way, okay?

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:12.401
You know, Frank and I are partners,
and he says you're gone.

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.449
So you're gone.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.844
I thought maybe it could work out,
but it can't. It doesn't.

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.285
- Come on.
- I feel sick.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.683
Just get out of the car. Let's go.
Come on. Go!

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.848
- I don't want to go.
- Go!

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.526
Angela, move. Get out of the car.
Come on.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.724
Your mother's gonna be waiting for you.
Let's go.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.450
Go!

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.771
And don't ever call me again,
okay? Don't.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.325
What's that?

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.050
What's that?!

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.766
I got it for you at the airport.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.127
I paid for it.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.562
- Why did you even call me?
- I'm sorry.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.202
- Why did you?
- Angie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.570
Come on. Come on back in the car.
Come on. I'm sorry, okay?

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.165
I'm sorry.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:13.530
You're not a bad guy,
you're just not a very good one.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.449
Hello.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.001
<i>Hey, Roy, pick it up.</i>

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.804
<i>Pick it up.</i>

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:43.969
<i>- Hello.
- You all right?</i>

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:47.727
- Yeah, what's it look like?
- You hungry?

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.604
No.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.606
<i>Want to meet? We still got
Chuck's money to split.</i>

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.881
What time is it?

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.963
It's almost 3.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.889
<i>- Taking your pills?
- Can you hold on</i> a <i>second?</i>

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.529
Pygmies!

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.127
Roy?

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.170
- <i>Medical</i> Group.
- Yes, Dr. Klein, please.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:39.008
<i>I'm sorry. He's unavailable. Dr. Wiley is
on call if you'd like me to page him.</i>

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.130
That's very good, but actually,
I gotta talk to Klein.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:47.081
- Is there a way I can get ahold of him?
- I'm sorry, he <i>is</i> gone for the weekend.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:51.131
Where did he go?
Okay, look, look.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.204
Listen, I need a new thing of pills.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:58.450
Well, actually,
are you at his office now?

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.285
<i>- I'm sorry, sir. The office is closed.</i>
- Shit!

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.522
- Sorry, my phone is dying.
- Yes, sir.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.480
<i>If this is a medical emergency,
contact your local hospital or call 911.</i>

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.962
Help me! ls there a way
you can help me help you help me...

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.805
...so that I can get in his office?

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.687
Don't forget to drink
plenty of water with that.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.365
Thanks.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.569
- Excuse me, hi.
<i>- I'll</i> be right with you, sir.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.491
I need a refill.
I don't have a prescription--

01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:00.042
- Sir, please wait your turn.
- I know, but this is an emergency.

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.770
Buddy, ever heard of a line?

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.766
Ever been dragged to the sidewalk
and beaten until you pissed blood?

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.844
Listen, I'm sorry, I really need--
Thank you.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.445
Thank you.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.444
- I need a refill of this.
- Do you have a prescription?

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.969
No, but my doctor, my shrink, gave me
these, and they're samples of--

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.487
Darn it! I can't remember--
Prefex something.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.644
Without a prescription,
there's nothing I can do.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.601
But I have the packet,
so I'm clearly allowed to have them.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.843
I need four or five of them
to cover me for the weekend.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.202
- Let me see it.
- Thank you.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.169
And I am sorry, sir.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.609
- These are supplements.
- What?

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.565
- This packet contains supplements.
- No, no, no.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.331
My doctor gave those to me.
They're Prefex.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.802
- They're supplements.
- Bullshit, man! Prefex.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.689
- Supplifem.
- Prefex!

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.968
- Aisle four, sir.
- Prefex!

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.811
Did you call security?

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.324
Did you give me this?

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.482
- Yes.
- Why?

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:18.043
- Because you don't need medication.
- Look at me, I'm a mess.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.807
Agreed. But you weren't a mess
last week, and you weren't on...

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.327
...Prefexall then either.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.165
I have news for you.
Your neurosis is small-time.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:31.882
Small-time? What are you a--?
You fucking quack!

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.849
Your conscience is another story.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.482
Let me ask a question.
What if you had to change careers?

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.884
- What, if I wasn't an antiques broker?
- If you weren't a criminal.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.241
Huh?

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.563
That's an 18th century Queen Anne
footstool I've had my feet on.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.520
I've had computer programmers tell me
what a nice piece it is.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.642
I'm not a criminal.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.049
I'm a con artist.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.329
- The difference being?
- They give me their money.

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.209
That's a nice rationalization.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.126
I never took anybody who didn't let me
out of greed or weakness.

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.928
And I never...

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.366
...used violence.

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.290
Would you say then you set
an example in your trade?

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.244
You bet I do.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:20.047
But now you have to set an example
for someone else.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.283
How is she?

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.484
Angela.

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.768
She's fine.

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.570
She went back to her mom's.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.961
Have you spoken to her?

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.048
Why not?

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.721
Do we have to talk about this?

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.241
Why haven't you spoken?

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.483
Because she hates me.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.764
Why do you think she hates you?

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.523
Because...

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.001
Because I screwed it up.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:02.251
Oh, God. I lost my little girl.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.924
I lost my little girl.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.769
I'm happy to"

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.961
I went to see a lawyer.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.084
He specializes in custody suits.

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.805
That sort of thing.

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.364
Like when one parent wants to get
joint custody of the child.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.486
There are things you have to do...

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.166
...file some paperwork...

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.325
...blood tests, go before a judge.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.927
It would only be for weekends
and some holidays to start.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.251
But I'd have to make a lot of changes.

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.930
For one thing, I'd have to stop doing
what I do for a living.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:32.330
Honey, I'm sorry.
I should have asked you first.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.129
Will you try? Please?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.049
Yes, I'll try, honey.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.361
<i>I'll</i> try.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.886
When?

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.641
As of now.

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:15.682
You gotta do what you gotta do.

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.491
I'm sorry to lose you.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.324
You don't want the 40 G's?

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:24.290
Keep it. Consider it a parting gift.

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:30.326
We should part more often.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.490
Did I tell you I love you?

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.448
Yeah, I love you back.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.849
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.244
One of these days,
I'm gonna get you drunk.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:59.801
I should tell your mom about this.
Let her know what I'm doing.

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.610
- Your funeral.
- I know.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:05.207
But I think she should hear it
from me.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.328
What do you think?

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.961
Um... Yeah.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.043
0K8)'-

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.806
- I'm excited about this.
- We could get a dog.

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.045
- Either a German shepherd or a Lab.
- They're messy, aren't they?

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.850
We could train it.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.207
- Name it Frank.
- That's a good name.

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.201
Sefiorita.

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.883
That's nice.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.084
<i>Sefiorita.</i>

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.883
- For you, sefiorita.
- Thank you.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.726
Let's dance.

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.011
"My house is your house"?

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.527
Frank!

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.404
Get back.

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.244
Hello, Roy.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.525
- Hiya, sunshine.
- Go wait in your room, honey.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.126
Let her stay.
She's in this as much as you are.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.883
It's Angela, right?

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.169
Your mug shot doesn't do you justice.
You wanna sit down?

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.120
- If you come anywhere near her--
- Don't play tough. I'm in your home.

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.563
Roy, I'm sorry, man.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.881
Shut up!

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.611
How did you find me?

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.046
I didn't.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:01.005
I found her in black and white.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.171
Airport security cameras, Roy,
they got a nice look at her.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.924
That was sloppy.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.567
- There were no cameras in the lounge.
- No.

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:16.404
There were in the gift shop.
In my business, it pays...

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.484
...to have friends on the force.
Your girl's in their books.

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:23.561
Your ex-wife doesn't know well enough
not to give out your address.

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.206
We only hurt the ones we love, huh?

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:32.722
You look white as a ghost, Roy.
I don't want you to pass out...

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.805
...before you make your first payment.
First let's have the money you took.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.042
- I don't have it.
- Start with what you do have!

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:41.601
Uh... Uh...

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.445
- Four thousand, maybe.
- Where?

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.680
The dog.

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.764
Stop! Let her get it.
You stay here with me.

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.566
It's okay. It's okay, honey, go.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.370
- Run, Angela! Run!
- Run, and Daddy's dead right now!

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.568
Okay, okay.

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:04.085
Next, I get half of whatever
you make from now on.

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:08.131
If not, I call my cop friends, and your
little girl goes to juvy till she's 18.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.524
- I'm out. I'm done with this.
- You're not done, Roy.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:15.201
You haven't even gotten your feet wet.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.971
Frank's not done, are you, Frank?
You done, Frank?

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.163
He's not done.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.882
Angela, no. Put the gun down.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.685
- Shoot him.
- Quiet, Frank.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.968
Angela, okay. Angela. Angela.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.164
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Put it down. I'll take care of this.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:33.448
- I want you to go.
- Know how to use that?

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.648
- Don't make it worse!
- Shoot him!

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.724
Goddamn it, shoot him!

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.161
Okay, okay.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.043
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, God.

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.930
Oh, God.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.848
- Oh, God!
- Oh, shit, Roy.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.048
He ain't gonna make it.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.088
Okay, okay, okay, Okay-

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:37.051
You know where
the Seven Palms Motel is?

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.727
- It's out at the 15.
- Okay, get a room there.

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:44.362
Ground floor, if you have to go
out the back. Wait there for me.

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:45.965
What if you don't show?

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.886
Take her to her mother's,
and drive south and never come back.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:51.565
What are you gonna do?

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.961
I'm gonna take him to the hospital.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.730
Angela, sweetheart.

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.043
Listen to me. Frank will get you
out of here, all right?

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.727
He's gonna get you out of here,
and I will see you in a day or two.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.084
- Everything will be all right, I promise.
- Dad, I was just trying to--

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.323
I know, I know. Listen to me.
Listen, I know, I know.

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.285
You didn't shoot him.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.807
Do you understand? I shot him. I did.

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.928
- Isn't that right, Frank?
- Right.

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.923
So you just sit tight, honey.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:22.801
And I want you to know that I'm sorry.

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.327
I'm sorry I let you down.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.284
Okay, Frank.

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.204
- Go, okay?
- Okay.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.761
- I'm serious.
- Roy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.730
- All right. All right.
- I'm really sorry.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.842
You're okay, man.

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.130
- He's okay.
- <i>Nurse</i> Hoffman.

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.762
<i>- Nurse Hoffman to Pediatrics.
- Good morning, Roy. How do you</i> feel?

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.331
Cold.

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:40.685
Take it slow, will you?

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:43.605
I'm Detective Bishop.
This is Detective Holt.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.161
The doctor will be in in a second.

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:51.810
You were given a pretty close haircut
the other night, Roy. Bad concussion.

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:55.043
You got lucky, Roy.
I wish we could say the same for Chuck.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.649
Am I under arrest?

01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.362
Well, you have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and may be...

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.688
I heard it all.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.202
Roy, where's Frank?

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.284
- Who?
- Frank Mercer.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.410
Your partner. We've been
spending time at your places.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:18.565
- There's not a lot we don't know.
- I like your place better. Clean.

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.049
Where is he?

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.047
Okay, then how about this?

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.291
Where's Angela? Because she's not at...

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.404
415 Chester Ave.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.927
Her mother's near hysterical.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.721
I shot him.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.691
I shot Chuck.

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.081
You sure about that?

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.962
Because Chuck didn't make it. We
found him facedown in your driveway.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:52.364
It's not good, but I'm telling you,
it could still get a lot worse.

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.800
Alas, the print we took off your .38
was just a little small.

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:01.203
- So where is she?
- I wanna see my doctor.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:05.251
- The doctor will be here in a second.
- No, my doctor, my shrink.

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:09.490
You let me see him, and I'll tell you
everything you wanna know.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.289
What's his number?

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.849
Hello, Roy.

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.566
- Hey, doc.
- Hi.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.564
Can we have a little privacy?

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.404
That's not the way it works.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.201
Don't I have doctor-patient privileges,
rights, something?

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.124
Yeah, technically, he's right.

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.409
That refers to testimony based
on confidential information.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.444
There's no privilege says
I gotta leave you two alone.

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.166
There is if you want what I know.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.489
Five minutes.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.287
Roy, what happened? They told--

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.327
Okay, listen. Angela is in trouble.

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.131
If I don't help her, she will go to jail.

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.329
- So please help me help her.
- I can't do anything illegal.

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:08.962
- You got her into this too.
- Don't transfer responsibility, Roy.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:12.329
Just make a phone call for me,
all right? Please?

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.209
- All right.
- Check out...

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.442
...Seven Palms Motel in Bakersfield.

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.960
It's like a giant cricket.

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.485
<i>And then what?</i>

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:30.564
I asked you to turn the machine off,
right?

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.406
Tell Angela the pass code,
and then you tell her to write it down.

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.040
- Pass code?
- They'll search you on your way out.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.962
- Right.
- It's 543N7942.

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.003
- 59--
- Doc!

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.010
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.051
543N7942. Say it back to me.
Say it back.

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.680
So it's 543N7542.

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.008
No, N7942.

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.481
N, Norman, 7942.

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.723
- That's all you have to do.
- 543N7942.

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:03.928
543N7942.

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.889
Thank you, doc.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.840
She's gonna be okay.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.002
Angela's gonna be all right.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.203
Hey, hello?

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:23.409
Hey, can you guys put
the air conditioning on?

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.847
It's hot.

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:32.051
What is it? Bishop? Bishop!

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:40.520
Detectives, can you make it a little...

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.247
...cooler in here?

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.446
Whoa, whoa.

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:33.124
<i>FRANK". Dear Roy, you're probably
pretty upset. I don't blame you.</i>

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.127
<i>You taught me most of what I know,
so I suppose I owe you better than this.</i>

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:42.484
<i>But you always told me if I ever got
a shot at a big score, I should take it.</i>

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.642
<i>And that's What I did.</i>

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.482
Taxi!

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:53.961
Sorry, sorry!

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:58.011
<i>FRANK". Sorry about the sap on the head,
by the way, and for everything else.</i>

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:04.488
<i>You always said guys like us can't afford
to have regrets about what we do.</i>

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.283
<i>That's gonna be a little harder for me,
but I'll manage.</i>

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.326
<i>Well, no, I told her I'm a psychiatrist.
I can't lie, Roy.</i>

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.485
Hey, hey, hey, hey, pal!

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.044
<i>FRANK". If it makes any difference,
you're the best I ever saw.</i>

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.807
<i>I'd never find a better partner,
and now I won't have to.</i>

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.686
<i>I love you, man. Frank.</i>

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.204
Booth today, Mr. Waller?

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:13.930
<i>P.S. Enjoy the gift.</i>

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.690
<i>She said you were a bad guy.</i>

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:27.204
<i>You don't seem like a bad guy.</i>

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.610
<i>Well, I don't think you're a bad guy.</i>

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:51.408
Roy?

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.244
Heather.

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.449
She's...

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.848
She's not here, is she?

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:11.963
- What?
- Angela.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.407
Who? What?

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.682
Roy, what are you talking about?

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.806
The baby.
You were gonna have a baby.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.247
That's why you're here?

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.329
You were pregnant.

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.326
You were pregnant! You were.
You were pregnant.

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.648
I lost it.

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:51.683
Roy, you okay?

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.171
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.889
Excuse me one second.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.526
- Hey, boss.
- Roy, another live one.

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.046
All right.

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.729
Afternoon.

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.360
- How you doing?
- Can I help you find anything?

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:38.047
Yeah, I need a carpet.

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.046
- For your home?
- For my secretary's office.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:47.010
- No, it's for my apartment.
- Aha.

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:49.083
- All one room of it.
- Big place?

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.050
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, well, you have a color in mind?

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.040
I have a price in mind. Cheap.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.891
You don't need much,
you don't know what you want...

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.526
...but no price is too low.
- That's about me.

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:04.650
You are my perfect customer.
Let's dig into the remnants.

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:09.488
Wait, wait, wait. My girlfriend knows
a bit better than I do what we need.

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:11.928
Hey, sweetie.

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.089
There she is.

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.843
I, uh...

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.281
I think we should go with the dark
because of the dog.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:41.284
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fair enough.
We just got a dog.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.920
Let me guess, a Lab.

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.884
German shepherd, but...

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.809
My next guess.

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.122
There's no, like...

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:58.081
...I don't know, special carpet
that dogs like, is there?

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.681
Yeah, yeah. We call it AstroTurf.

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:12.363
Come on, remnants are in the back
of the store.

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.641
You folks just move in together?

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.848
Yeah, three weeks ago.

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.647
- Big step.
- I kind of like this one.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.805
Yeah, that's a nice choice.
So dark you barely notice stains.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.604
You like it?

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.489
How much is it?

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.328
Well, the sticker says 75, but I can
knock 20 percent off if you pay cash.

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:44.367
This is our living arrangement.
I pay rent. She buys the carpets.

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.244
- Shit.
- What's up?

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.528
I think I left my wallet...

01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.604
Yeah, I left my wallet in the car.

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:54.206
- Do you think you could go get it?
- Yeah.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.482
I'll be right back.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.687
Thanks for not saying anything.

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.885
How long have you worked here?

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:20.688
A While.

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.211
So, what, you working this guy?

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.885
No.

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.042
No, no. No, I'm retired.

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.488
That was a one-time deal.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.123
No kidding? You were...

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:38.606
...good.

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:41.721
I had a good teacher.

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.402
- Teachers.
- I'm surprised to see you here.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:51.408
I figured you would have moved out to,
I don't know, Hawaii.

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.767
I kind of got screwed on my cut.
You know Frank.

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.610
You're gonna go swimming,
you're gonna get wet, right?

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:08.769
You changed your hair.

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:10.844
Makes you look grown-up.

01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.125
I am grown-up.

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.767
You always go out dressed like this?

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.927
Sometimes.

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.844
Why, you gonna ground me?

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.602
Sorry.

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:36.567
I'm sorry too...

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:41.925
...if it's any consolation.

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.204
You mad at me?

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.602
You didn't take it.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.922
I gave it to you.

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.682
It's a funny way of looking at it.

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:05.282
Well, I see things differently now.

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.322
So you like this guy?

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.643
Yeah, he's sweet to me.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.491
I met him at a bowling alley.

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.691
We had a good time, didn't we?

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.328
Yeah, we did.

01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.729
Thanks, buddy. Right there.

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.766
- Let me tie it off.
- it's good to see you, Roy.
