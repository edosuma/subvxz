WEBVTT

00:32.866 --> 00:35.069
Previously on Southland:

00:35.103 --> 00:37.037
Sal.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.109
You're still
calling him "partner."

00:41.142 --> 00:42.510
That can't make him feel good.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.777
I'm just trying
to give him hope

00:43.811 --> 00:45.446
and let him know I'm
still there for him.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.047
I just miss you.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.084
You're a crap cop,
okay, Chickie?

00:50.118 --> 00:52.820
You used to be a good one,
but you're not anymore.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.658
You know, it goes against
my business instinct,

00:57.691 --> 00:59.160
but you might have a
little drug problem.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.861
Let's get out of here.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.798
(sirens wailing)

01:04.832 --> 01:05.766
John!

01:05.799 --> 01:07.235
Need a hand!
Somebody's pinned!

01:07.268 --> 01:08.536
Come here!

01:14.142 --> 01:16.844
I'm gonna check the legs.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.279
He's clear!

01:18.312 --> 01:20.114
Clear?
Yeah.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.382
Guys, the back.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.551
Push it down.
We're going to lift up.

01:23.584 --> 01:27.421
Okay. On three.
One, two, three.

01:28.856 --> 01:33.761
MAN:
On this night,
Officer Ben Sherman would learn

01:33.794 --> 01:37.165
that a cop is only
as strong as his partner.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.167
(sighs)

01:52.513 --> 01:54.615
(groans)

02:18.372 --> 02:20.374
We got a double.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.342
Who's on it?

02:21.375 --> 02:22.543
Me. I'm up.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.378
Good. You can take
the new guy with you.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.946
New guy?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.716
Ray's in court for one day and
you stick me with somebody else?

02:28.749 --> 02:30.184
I like Ray.

02:30.218 --> 02:30.984
We click.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.887
Trust me.
You'll like this one, too.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.462
Russ, you're out
of the hospital.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.663
Yeah. A week ago.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.298
A week?

02:44.332 --> 02:45.899
It's been a week since
I've talked to you?

02:45.933 --> 02:47.268
Mm-hmm.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.669
He's on light duty.

02:48.702 --> 02:52.506
So, don't go chasing
after any criminals.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.242
(chuckles)

02:54.275 --> 02:55.776
Surprised?

02:55.809 --> 02:59.247
Yeah. Dina let you
out of the house?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.715
Yeah. She's in New York,
meeting with publishers.

03:01.749 --> 03:02.983
Publishers?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.618
Yeah. She's trying
to sell her blog.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.919
"I Heart a Cop."

03:05.953 --> 03:07.221
Gonna make it
into a book.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.289
But there's not
a lot of love

03:08.322 --> 03:09.823
between the two of us
these days.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.293
So, that means it'll
be a work of fiction.

03:12.326 --> 03:15.529
Yeah. Exactly.

03:15.563 --> 03:20.234
"I like Ray.
We click"?

03:20.268 --> 03:21.402
(groans)

03:21.435 --> 03:24.838
The ones I've been getting
aren't working anymore, Laurie.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.708
Your dealer is not selling
you placebos, John.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.576
You know him?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.877
No. Lis--

03:29.910 --> 03:31.412
You're building up
a tolerance, okay?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.314
Even if I gave you
something stronger,

03:33.347 --> 03:34.748
you'll eventually build
a tolerance to that, too.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.351
You are in pain
for a reason.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.019
You've got to start
listening to your body

03:39.052 --> 03:42.756
or you are going to
wind up in a wheelchair.

03:44.525 --> 03:48.028
You know, I don't know
a lot of married couples

03:48.061 --> 03:51.031
that can still stand
each other after a divorce.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.433
Yeah.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.568
I still think
of you as family.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.973
What?

04:00.007 --> 04:02.310
You have cancer or something?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.779
I'm turning 40 next week.

04:05.813 --> 04:09.650
And I'm thinking
about having a kid.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.520
That's good.
A kid.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.522
Uh...

04:14.555 --> 04:15.923
Who with?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.058
I'm checking out
options, okay?

04:18.091 --> 04:22.496
Adoption. And, um,
a sperm donor.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.931
(sighs)

04:23.964 --> 04:27.801
(chuckles)
Hey, hey.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.903
I wouldn't laugh.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.405
I used to think
that we were going

04:31.439 --> 04:32.573
to have a child
together once.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.380
You asking
to have a kid with me?

04:39.413 --> 04:41.915
Will you at least think
about it?

04:46.687 --> 04:49.089
Yeah.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.359
I'll think about it.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.427
Thank you.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.996
(dog barking)
Other end of a
black man's gun,

04:56.029 --> 04:58.466
you're either gonna
get shot or robbed.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.468
And one of these six-toed,
banjo-playing peckerwoods

05:00.501 --> 05:03.437
points a gun at you, you're
going to the desert in a cooler.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.339
Probably make a belt buckle
out of your nipples.

05:05.373 --> 05:08.576
Well, you gotta admire their
leather-working skills, huh?

05:08.609 --> 05:11.579
ANDY:
So, did you, uh...
did you get that reservation?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.614
SAL:
I did. Thank you.
Sure.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.449
What, you taking Captain Sue
out tonight?

05:15.483 --> 05:16.884
Yep, going to finally celebrate
her promotion.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.519
ANDY:
Look at this guy.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.120
Married to the bars and stars.
Let me ask you something.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.755
Does she sign
your overtime slips?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.391
'Cause that would
be convenient.
Ha, ha, funny guy.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.892
Does she, uh-- does she
like to clean your gun?

05:24.925 --> 05:26.494
Ooh, that's...
(laughs)

05:26.527 --> 05:27.795
(phone rings)
Shut up!

05:27.828 --> 05:29.029
Excuse me, ladies.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.898
Hey, hey, hey, Andy.
Sorry, it's early.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.066
I haven't had
any coffee.
Hey, how's it going?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.803
I'm doing a story
on the Canyon Rapist.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.638
Three rapes in one month.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.039
Yeah, scumbag.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.474
Impersonating a cop.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.909
City's in a panic.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.110
Do you care to comment?

05:43.143 --> 05:44.512
I think I just did.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.647
I want to see you, Sal.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.948
Yeah, yeah.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.117
I want to see you, too.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.522
All right, listen up.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.425
We're at max deployment.
Everyone knows why.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.526
The Canyon Rapist.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.093
There will be
no days off.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.695
All Vice, SPU
and nonessential

06:01.729 --> 06:03.864
detective personnel
will roll with us

06:03.897 --> 06:05.533
until further notice.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.401
This guy's hit our division
three times

06:07.435 --> 06:08.436
in the last month.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.070
I take that personally.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.705
I know you do, too.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.908
(siren wailing)

06:14.942 --> 06:16.810
All right, now that you got

06:16.844 --> 06:18.446
your car assignments,
I'm gonna turn it over

06:18.479 --> 06:20.781
to Detective Roberts
with Sex Crimes.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.951
ROBERTS:
The guy we're looking for
is a male Caucasian.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.419
Six-foot-two.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.520
Hundred ninety pounds.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.655
Brown hair.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.657
Blue eyes. Approximate age, 40.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.125
His uniform is like ours.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.161
His badge is a shield.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.430
(tapping window)

06:38.031 --> 06:40.100
This department's
had to overcome a lot

06:40.133 --> 06:41.134
these past 20 years.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.736
There are people out there

06:42.770 --> 06:45.773
who will think this
is another dirty cop.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.942
We can't allow that
to happen.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.911
The sooner we catch
this guy,

06:50.944 --> 06:53.847
the sooner we can all
go back to normal.

06:53.881 --> 06:54.848
(woman crying)

06:59.720 --> 07:02.823
(tires squealing)

07:05.025 --> 07:08.762
Max deployment is not the way
to go for this.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.599
Care to tell me why?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.467
Sure. The rapist

07:13.501 --> 07:15.536
is used to seeing one or two
black-and-whites on the street.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.571
Now he sees ten to 20.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.573
CHICKIE:
Maybe that's the idea.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.575
It'll push him out of our area.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.076
Force him into hiding.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.079
Five times the amount
of boots on the street.

07:26.113 --> 07:30.017
Just makes it that much more
likely we're gonna catch him.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.184
Yeah.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.153
Well, you're wrong.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.491
Last guy that dressed
like a cop and raped women

07:37.525 --> 07:39.727
got caught because
of a lone cop

07:39.760 --> 07:42.062
with world-class instincts
who froze his balls off

07:42.095 --> 07:44.898
in an alley
for two nights.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.133
Trust me, when this
guy gets caught

07:46.166 --> 07:49.637
it's gonna be because
of a street cop.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.941
Maximum deployment.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.943
Nothing but a hand
job for the press.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.078
John, John, up on the left.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.149
I locked my keys
in my car.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.818
What would you like us to do
about that, ma'am?

08:04.852 --> 08:07.555
Can't you just use
your master key?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.922
Ooh, the "master key."

08:08.956 --> 08:10.924
That magically unlocks
everything.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.160
Every door in the whole city.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.695
John, there's a rapist
on the street.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.996
Pop the trunk.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.999
(trunk clicks)

08:23.270 --> 08:26.006
(garbled radio transmission)

08:29.610 --> 08:31.278
Have a nice day.

08:32.646 --> 08:33.947
The home of Jack
and Linda Durand.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.115
Well liked in the neighborhood.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.618
Back window was
pulled off.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.152
Kid tried to call 911,

08:39.186 --> 08:41.288
and wasn't able
to get a line out.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.258
Phone is dead.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.595
Which is consistent
with the grandson's story.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.229
How old's the kid?
Four.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.599
RUSSELL:
Where's little
boy now?

08:51.632 --> 08:52.900
Down the street
at his preschool.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.902
Ran to the nearest place
he can recognize.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.637
School administrator's
called it in.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.806
You want me
to bring him here?
No. We'll go to him.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.008
Could you get a
photograph of this?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.643
RUSSELL:
Is that a homemade
silencer?

09:02.676 --> 09:04.612
Yeah.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.312
Jewelry's gone.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.446
Yeah, no pro

09:06.479 --> 09:09.950
would turn a simple home
invasion into a double homicide.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.952
Jack was shot first.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.788
Silencer blew off
and hit the headboard.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.056
Forgot that you did that.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.059
Call the murder victims
by their first name.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.962
Linda must've heard
the shot and woke up.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.263
You got a time of death?

09:23.296 --> 09:26.133
Lividity puts it between
midnight and 2:00.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.136
Come look at these
defensive wounds.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.209
Um, who knows what
the grandson saw?

09:36.243 --> 09:38.378
I'll go to the preschool.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.347
I'll find out.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.958
The car needs repair work
sooner or later.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.728
Go ask some questions.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.697
Yeah.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.635
Stay here.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.840
Hope you've given
some thought

10:06.874 --> 10:10.010
about the conversation
we had a few weeks ago.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.211
What?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.346
Communications
Division.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.285
I've never worked
a desk in my life.

10:18.318 --> 10:22.255
You want me to start out
all over again on the bottom?

10:22.289 --> 10:23.891
How's that any different than
what you're doing right now?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.092
What is your problem?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.927
Look, I know this sucks,
all right.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.096
But people don't always get
better with practice.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.064
You're not a street cop anymore.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.734
Because I disagreed with you?

10:33.767 --> 10:34.534
(chuckles)
No.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.203
Not because you disagreed
with me.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.771
It's 'cause the way
you see things.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.306
The way you carry yourself.
I don't know,

10:39.339 --> 10:40.440
maybe it's because you
worked with Dewey

10:40.473 --> 10:42.776
for so long.
The way I carry myself?!

10:45.846 --> 10:48.782
(bleep) you, John.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.888
They haven't worked on
any black Crown Vics.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.357
Good, let's keep moving.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.827
I don't, I don't know
that much about pearls.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.128
So, how do I know?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.196
Natural pearls, the best.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.398
Only from the Red Sea.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.835
Yeah?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.970
How much?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.972
40 to 70% off.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.106
You help after robbery, Sal.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.409
Wholesale for you.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.012
All right, I'll take
this one here.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.280
Classic.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.815
She will have for the rest
of her life.

11:21.849 --> 11:22.582
Good choice, my friend.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.753
Yeah, let's hope.
(phone ringing)

11:25.786 --> 11:28.789
Um, I'll be right
with you, all right?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.891
(phone ringing)

11:30.924 --> 11:32.459
Hey, what's up?

11:32.492 --> 11:34.194
MIA:
I'm at a press conference.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.229
Your wife is here.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.498
She's prettier than I expected.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.468
Hey, you didn't talk to her,
did you?

11:41.501 --> 11:42.535
No.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.238
God, Sal, what kind of person
do you think I am?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.374
The mayor's here.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.910
He says he watches me
every night.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.178
Yeah, I'll bet he does.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.847
(giggling):
No, he was really nice.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.415
He actually invited us to a
party at his house tonight.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.250
Are you crazy? Us?

11:57.284 --> 11:58.518
That's not gonna happen.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.788
Well, he invited me.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.756
But I'd love to have you there.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.925
Yeah, I can't. I got plans.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.326
With the family?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.395
Uh, yeah.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.264
(sighing)

12:11.298 --> 12:13.834
Hey, listen,
I gotta go, all right?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.936
All right.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.807
WOMAN:
He's my child.
I want to take him home.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.775
Is this how you treat your
parents of your children?

12:21.809 --> 12:23.510
Is this what you do?!
Detective Clarke.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.978
Is that a detective?

12:25.012 --> 12:26.847
Detective, I need to
speak with you now!

12:26.880 --> 12:28.281
DENNIS:
Stop, stop.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.017
I'll be out in a few minutes.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.452
Have a seat.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.459
(sighs)

12:39.492 --> 12:41.361
CHILD:
And they look around.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.798
So, Michael, this is where your
granny and grandpa sleep, right?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.099
Where's your room?

12:46.133 --> 12:48.135
Show me with this guy.
Where's your room?

12:48.168 --> 12:49.269
Show me there.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.404
Is this your room?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.874
Cool.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.877
Is this where you were
when you heard the boom?

12:56.910 --> 12:59.546
Uh-oh, close your eyes.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.348
The green dragon is coming.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.549
Green dragon?

13:02.582 --> 13:04.952
The one that made grammy melt.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.178
(siren wailing)

13:41.088 --> 13:43.056
She walked right down
from the hill and...

13:43.090 --> 13:45.058
Fell down the street.
Who did this to you?

13:45.092 --> 13:46.860
(trembling):
He was a cop.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.296
JOHN:
A43 Code 6.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.865
Just occurred
at our location.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.166
You're safe now.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.135
Suspect being described
as a police officer.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.404
(crying):
Where's Max?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.907
Max?
Where's my baby?

13:59.940 --> 14:02.275
Ma'am, you had a baby with you?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.244
Where's your baby?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.079
Where is he?

14:06.113 --> 14:07.380
In my car!

14:23.130 --> 14:25.065
We're gonna follow you
to the hospital.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.634
We won't leave until you're
joined by a counselor, okay?

14:27.667 --> 14:29.236
You understand?

14:29.269 --> 14:30.203
Okay.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.873
(groaning and panting)

14:51.524 --> 14:54.361
(cooing)

14:54.394 --> 14:56.063
Is he okay?

15:01.068 --> 15:04.337
A43, advise all units,
we found the child.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.339
(over radio):
A43, copy that.

15:11.644 --> 15:15.015
It didn't seem real, you know?

15:15.048 --> 15:19.552
I'd seen something
about it on the news.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.990
I almost didn't stop the car.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.194
But then I saw
the police lights.

15:27.227 --> 15:31.031
He had a uniform and everything.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.703
Is he a police officer?

15:36.736 --> 15:38.705
No, ma'am.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.340
He wasn't.

15:42.375 --> 15:47.214
Take this. It's
for your shoulder.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.049
Hey, Kathleen.

15:49.082 --> 15:52.252
John. (chuckles)
How've you been?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.987
I'm good. How are you?

15:54.021 --> 15:56.756
I almost didn't recognize you.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.691
Yeah.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.593
Uh, it's been a while.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.241
Oh, excuse me,
my sister...
Yeah, hi.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.110
My sister-in-law,
Misty, is here.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.545
Oh, okay, have a seat.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.647
Okay.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.049
Michael!

16:22.082 --> 16:24.217
Oh, hey, kiddo!

16:24.251 --> 16:25.352
Oh!
Hey!

16:25.385 --> 16:27.154
How you doing?
I'm good.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.522
Oh, good, everything okay?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.468
Where's Michael?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.270
I don't want him going
to one of my sisters.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.372
He's mine.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.240
Why can't I have him?

16:47.274 --> 16:49.276
Child Protective
Services has him.

16:49.309 --> 16:53.046
It's up to them where he goes
for the time being.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.515
If you love him so much, why did
your mother have custody of him?

16:55.548 --> 16:58.251
She was keeping him
for me for a while.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.519
How long have you been
doing meth?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.456
I'm not gonna lie to you.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.225
I own a 12-gauge.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.295
You got priors.
You got domestics.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.098
I called the sheriff's station
out in Palmdale.

17:11.131 --> 17:15.268
And they say that they're
out at your place twice a week.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.336
Misty, man.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.705
She's kind of a force of nature.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.740
So, it's her fault
that there are holes

17:20.773 --> 17:23.576
kicked in all the walls
of your apartment?

17:25.345 --> 17:29.849
Would you blame a tsunami
for being a tsunami?

17:29.882 --> 17:35.322
Uh, where were you last night
between midnight and 2:00 am?

17:35.355 --> 17:38.491
Uh, driving in Arizona.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.394
What were you doing
in Arizona?

17:41.428 --> 17:44.397
I was delivering
cold rolled steel

17:44.431 --> 17:46.766
for the industry supply house
I work for.

17:46.799 --> 17:50.403
McManus-Starr.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.738
Okay.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.541
We're going to have
to test that shotgun.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.112
You know, I,

17:59.146 --> 18:02.415
uh, I hurt my leg
once poppin' wheelies

18:02.449 --> 18:04.751
a few years ago.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.555
I never been the same since.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.865
Hey.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.703
So excited to see you.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.438
High-five, buddy.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.274
Oh.
Ooh, ouch.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.675
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.791
I hope she burns in hell for
what she did to our parents.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.896
LYDIA:
The jewelry was missing.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.233
Meth addicts rob their
families all the time.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.301
No.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.603
Well, you said it yourself,
you and Dennis got high.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.271
Maybe the two of you
got carried away.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.706
No!

18:59.739 --> 19:02.775
What were you wearing?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.877
What?
Your clothes.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.514
Your son saw the killer.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.717
Oh... oh, God!

19:10.750 --> 19:14.721
(sobbing):
Oh, God!

19:14.754 --> 19:16.189
I'm serious, Chloe.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.857
Just promise me
that if a cop pulls you over

19:17.890 --> 19:19.959
you're gonna keep driving
till you get to a public area.

19:19.992 --> 19:24.364
Yeah, yeah, I already
called Mom and Olivia.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.766
I'm calling you last because
you're more stubborn than them.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.935
Just, just don't be stupid.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.870
All right, I'm your big brother.
I love you.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.772
Bye.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.641
How long are we gonna
have to hang around here

19:34.674 --> 19:36.376
before we get back
on the street?

19:36.409 --> 19:39.846
We're just waiting on the
rape crisis counselor.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.649
They should be here
in the next few hours.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.418
You really want to get this guy.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.456
Yeah.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.194
My mom was raped.

20:02.602 --> 20:06.806
Because they're Nazis and my
life is Auschwitz, that's why.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.676
It is a nightmare
most women can't imagine.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.378
A man pulling them over...
Dad!

20:11.411 --> 20:12.612
in broad daylight...
Dad! Dad!

20:12.645 --> 20:14.381
What?

20:14.414 --> 20:17.684
What?!

20:17.717 --> 20:19.652
Can I sleep over
Melissa's house tonight?

20:19.686 --> 20:22.522
That's why you're yelling?

20:22.555 --> 20:23.790
I said no.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.458
Just like the last
12 times you asked me.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.726
You know the rules.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.695
I have to meet
Melissa first.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.397
Yeah.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.565
Look, there's your girlfriend.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.535
Kimmy?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.637
What is it?

20:37.670 --> 20:39.572
Well, can I?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.742
Yeah.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.977
Sweet. He says I can go.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.813
Wait a minute.
I thought we said no.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.849
I changed my mind.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.518
(sighing)

20:51.551 --> 20:53.320
Oh, she was at the
press conference today.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.488
The serial rapist may be
stalking his next victim.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.656
Yeah?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.391
We gotta get going. Come on.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.831
Hey, can you, uh,
do me a favor, Kath?

21:04.864 --> 21:07.334
Look, I hate to ask,

21:07.367 --> 21:09.902
but, uh, I hurt my back
early in the shift and...

21:09.936 --> 21:11.671
I have some Motrin.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.006
Yeah, I took some already.
It's still killing me.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.383
Here's a sample pack.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.518
Great.
Does the trick
for my migraines.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.786
Cool.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.055
It's good to see you.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.934
And the plaster cast? I see.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.870
Yeah, I'll hold.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.905
Hey, I had
to kick Dennis loose.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.106
He had a rock-solid alibi.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.075
Well, Misty's
going downtown.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.877
If she knows anything,
she'll roll.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.812
You're so good, it's bad.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.714
Oh, hey.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.883
Uh-huh.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.519
Allergy-free?

21:59.552 --> 22:00.487
Okay.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.022
Thanks, Mark. I appreciate
you guys rushing it.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.091
So, the material
that we sent out to the lab

22:05.124 --> 22:07.059
that he made the
silencer out of

22:07.093 --> 22:09.596
is a hypoallergenic
quilt stuffing.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.532
It's bought in bulk,
and it's only sold in one place.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.933
In the City of Industry.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.802
Good tacos out that way.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.770
Yeah.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.410
You're doing
good, Russ.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.745
Apart from the limp.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.414
Do I look pasty to you?

22:27.447 --> 22:28.815
You always
look pasty.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.450
You never look pasty.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.652
I'm getting my first gray hair.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.720
See that?

22:33.753 --> 22:35.388
That's from worrying
about you.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.590
Bullshit.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.564
This could be the guy.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.834
You're contact.
I'm cover.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.570
You get everyone
out of the vehicle.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.842
A43, show us Code 6

22:55.875 --> 22:57.844
on Winston between Main
and Los Angeles.

22:57.877 --> 23:01.080
Requesting warrants
on 3-Ocean-Edward-

23:01.113 --> 23:02.882
Boy-0-5-8.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.752
DISPATCH:
3-Ocean-Edward-Boy-0-5-8. Copy.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.426
Could you shut off the engine

23:13.460 --> 23:15.562
and get out of the car
for me now, please?

23:15.595 --> 23:16.863
MAN:
Uh, why?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.164
Why?

23:18.197 --> 23:19.466
Put your

23:19.499 --> 23:21.601
hands on the wheel now!

23:21.634 --> 23:25.104
Sir, put your hands
above your head.

23:25.137 --> 23:28.040
Keep 'em up.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.876
Turn around.
Face the car.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.713
Slowly walk back
towards me.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.583
Passenger, open your door,
and step out of the vehicle.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.150
That's enough.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.119
Put your hands behind your head
and interlock your fingers.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.788
You got me?

23:41.821 --> 23:43.790
Get to the back
of the car.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.925
(garbled radio transmission)

23:48.160 --> 23:50.497
Where'd he pick you up?
Down on
Santa Monica.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.099
What are you doing
in a black Crown Vic? Huh?

23:53.132 --> 23:54.467
It's my car.
Yeah?

23:54.501 --> 23:56.035
How long have you had
this car?

23:56.068 --> 23:58.204
Five, six
years, bro.
Five, six years?

23:58.237 --> 24:00.873
You guys been hearing about
this rapist running around?

24:05.645 --> 24:06.746
(sighs)

24:06.779 --> 24:08.114
This is not the guy.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.549
Black hair? Short?

24:09.582 --> 24:10.717
Is he a regular date?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.984
Yeah. I know him.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.588
Still a 647a.

24:15.622 --> 24:16.823
No. Come on. No way.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.991
Car checks out clean.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.259
No warrants.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.794
You want to
kick him loose?

24:21.828 --> 24:24.130
Yeah. What, we take him
in on a lewd conduct,

24:24.163 --> 24:26.766
we're off the street for,
what, another hour at least?

24:29.636 --> 24:31.971
Mr. Petrosian,
it's your lucky day.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.974
You have the right to
get the hell out of here.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.576
I suggest you
exercise it.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.711
(siren blaring)

24:39.979 --> 24:42.148
MAN:
Third row

24:42.181 --> 24:43.616
Okay.
Thank you.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.917
Hi.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.587
Do you guys sell
hypoallergenic quilt stuffing?

24:47.620 --> 24:48.721
Yeah, alpaca.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.523
We sell a ton
of that stuff.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.658
You do?

24:51.691 --> 24:53.660
Yeah. World's
a very toxic place.

24:53.693 --> 24:57.296
Do you recognize this woman?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.698
No.

24:58.731 --> 24:59.599
We're wholesalers.

24:59.632 --> 25:00.933
People are in and out.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.635
You know, interior decorators,
upholsterers.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.770
They pay cash

25:03.803 --> 25:05.271
mostly, or they buy
on account.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.573
How far back

25:06.606 --> 25:07.740
does that thing go?

25:07.774 --> 25:08.841
Few weeks, maybe months.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.009
Well, we're going

25:10.042 --> 25:12.011
to need to see your tapes.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.145
All of them.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.114
Who the hell is
Melissa anyway?

25:15.147 --> 25:17.016
One of her friends.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.050
Okay.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.752
Have you met
Melissa's parents?

25:19.786 --> 25:21.053
I work, Sal.
(phone hums)

25:21.087 --> 25:23.322
You're the one
who gave her permission to go.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.658
Yeah. I know.

25:25.692 --> 25:26.959
Who's that?

25:26.993 --> 25:28.728
Oh, just the guys.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.697

25:32.264 --> 25:33.966

MAN:
Yeah.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.167
Ten years

25:35.201 --> 25:36.836
my wife lets me
have sex with her

25:36.869 --> 25:37.804

a year now.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.105
Ugh! A toast.

MAN:
Yeah!

25:40.239 --> 25:41.173

Oh!

25:41.207 --> 25:44.777
To the best new captain
in the department.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.946
I don't know
what took them so long.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.247
You deserve it.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.582
Thank you.

25:49.616 --> 25:50.850
To you.

25:51.718 --> 25:55.922
(man spitting, raucous laughter)

25:55.955 --> 25:59.258
I'm a good cop.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.860
Right?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.995
Yeah.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.231
I mean, a street cop.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.867
What is his
deal with me?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.035
I don't know.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.870
You should ask him.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.739
(car horn honking,
tires squealing)

26:12.772 --> 26:14.907
(loud crash)

26:15.942 --> 26:17.977
A43. Possible traffic collision.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.812
The vicinity of Fountain
and Hayworth.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.580
Show us en route.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.617
(siren blaring)

26:26.686 --> 26:28.587
(tires squeak)

26:29.822 --> 26:31.190
Sure it doesn't
bother you?

26:31.223 --> 26:32.792
What, you making captain?

26:32.825 --> 26:34.861
Why should it bother me?

26:34.894 --> 26:37.263
(loud laughter)

26:37.296 --> 26:38.665
Do you
remember that,

26:38.698 --> 26:39.231
Bill?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.833
Because I outrank you.

26:40.867 --> 26:44.370
Come on. You must be catching
a lot of crap from the guys.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.372
Yeah, a little bit
of ball-busting.

26:46.405 --> 26:47.373
(loud laughter)

26:47.406 --> 26:48.875
MAN:

embarrassing.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.077

26:51.110 --> 26:53.913
Listen, Susan,
you saw something,

26:53.946 --> 26:55.281

26:55.314 --> 26:56.949

26:56.983 --> 26:58.651
MAN:
Boo-ya.

26:58.685 --> 26:59.952

27:01.120 --> 27:03.956
MAN:

that, Bill?

27:03.990 --> 27:06.025

27:12.999 --> 27:14.701
They're beautiful.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.669
Put 'em on.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.337
(thudding)

27:18.370 --> 27:21.841

things when you get drunk.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.081
Hey, hey.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.217
Pumpkinhead.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.420
Apologize.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.822
My bad.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.057
Not to me, you idiot.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.859
To the lady.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.063
Douche.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.766
(laughter)

27:46.799 --> 27:49.702

27:54.106 --> 27:55.441
Hey, yo.

27:55.474 --> 27:59.011
Hey! Hey!

27:59.045 --> 28:02.048
"My bad" is not an apology.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.115
Let's go.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.251
Oh.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.289
Baby-sitter, go.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.929
(applause)

28:22.068 --> 28:24.270

28:26.372 --> 28:28.775

28:28.808 --> 28:31.243
The corner of Homewood

28:31.277 --> 28:32.845
Two vehicles involved.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.046
Multiple victims.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.915
Roll me an RA unit.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.884
(siren blaring)

28:39.051 --> 28:40.152
Look out.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.288
I got these two
on the left.

28:44.323 --> 28:47.026
It's all right here?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.829
(sirens blaring,
fire truck horn toots)

28:49.862 --> 28:51.530
John!

28:51.563 --> 28:53.032
Need a hand!
Somebody's pinned!

28:53.065 --> 28:54.300
(gasping)
Come here!

29:00.172 --> 29:01.974
I'm gonna check the legs.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.109
Legs pinned.

Yeah.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.917
Okay, the back-- push it
down; we're gonna lift up.

29:10.950 --> 29:11.851
Yup.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.052
Okay? On three.
Ready.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.887
JOHN:

Good job.

29:14.921 --> 29:15.955

29:19.125 --> 29:20.226
Huh?
CHICKIE:

29:20.259 --> 29:22.995
All clear.

29:23.029 --> 29:26.298
CHICKIE:
Okay, just keep your arms
down by your side.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.433
We got you.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.902
We got you.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.177

(siren blaring)

29:40.179 --> 29:42.148
Come on. Let's go.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.462
So, you want me
to swing by your place later

29:56.495 --> 29:58.831
and make you
a grocery list?

29:59.966 --> 30:02.034
You know, I can take care
of myself.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.572
Well, have you even tried
to work things out with Dina?

30:09.375 --> 30:12.111
How about you?

30:12.144 --> 30:13.479
How about me what?

30:13.512 --> 30:15.514
Well...

30:15.547 --> 30:17.349
any forward movement
with the reporter?

30:17.383 --> 30:22.254
Or the guy who had to check
with his pastor for everything?

30:22.288 --> 30:23.255
(sighs)

30:23.289 --> 30:25.892
Or the guy that married
the woman he impregnated

30:25.925 --> 30:27.526
when he cheated on you?

30:27.559 --> 30:29.028
Um...
Terrell.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.362
Terrell. Yeah.
Yeah.

30:30.396 --> 30:33.199
I always admired his commitment
to family values.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.212
My hero.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.579
(laughs)

30:47.613 --> 30:49.882
Mm. You were so great
back there.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.017
Yeah.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.152
It's like old times.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.995
(horn honks)

31:06.398 --> 31:07.566
Ah.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.135
(phone ringing)

31:09.168 --> 31:11.003
Ugh!
Ought to do that
more often.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.439
Oh, it's Kimmy.

31:13.472 --> 31:14.941
Of course.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.475
Hi, sweetheart.

31:16.508 --> 31:17.676
Mom?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.445
Kimmy? What is it? What's wrong?

31:19.478 --> 31:20.679
I don't know where I am.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.681
You don't know where you are?

31:22.714 --> 31:25.017
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.353
Kimmy, it's Dad.
Where are you?

31:27.386 --> 31:29.922
I was leaving a party
and got a ride with some guys.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.023
Pull over.
Pull over.
You what?!

31:31.057 --> 31:32.391
Daddy, don't yell at me.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.526
I thought they were just going
to the next party,

31:34.560 --> 31:37.529
but they threw me out of the car
when I... when I wouldn't...

31:37.563 --> 31:38.697
Kimmy, where are you?

31:38.730 --> 31:41.233
(sighs)
Somewhere in the hills.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.035
Describe it
to me.
KIMMY:
I don't know.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.171
It's got weeds.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.173
Oh, my God.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.440
Daddy, I see headlights.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.076
Is that you?
How could it be me?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.377
You haven't told me
where you are.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.045
What if it's them
coming back for me?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.513
Kimmy, do you
still have the mace

31:54.546 --> 31:55.447
I gave you?
Yes.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.117
Okay, take it out,
and get off the road.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.986
Daddy, well, he's slowing down.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.387
Kimmy, what color is the car?

32:01.420 --> 32:02.588
Black.

32:02.621 --> 32:03.990
Does it look like
Daddy's old police car?

32:04.023 --> 32:05.091
I don't know. Maybe.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.458
Listen to me.
Oh, my God.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.960
Oh, my God,
he's stopping.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.095
Kimmy?!
Hi. Do you need help?

32:09.128 --> 32:10.662
(screaming)

32:10.696 --> 32:12.198
Kimmy!

32:12.231 --> 32:14.100
Sal.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.737
If he's that bad, we need
to take him to a hospital.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.172
We can't take him
to a hospital.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.207
We take him to a
hospital, he's done.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.374
He's out of
the field.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.709
Then what the hell
do we do with him?

32:23.742 --> 32:26.045
I got some pills
at my house.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.146
You need
a doctor.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.481
Just take me home now!

32:29.515 --> 32:31.017
(bleep).

32:31.050 --> 32:33.252
(sighs)

32:42.161 --> 32:46.365
Russ, Russ,
the aunt and uncle.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.533
Where are
you going?

32:47.566 --> 32:49.301
Child Services
just placed Michael

32:49.335 --> 32:51.203
with two
murderers.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.144
Oh, I messed up.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.312
Oh, I missed it.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.750
(sighs)

33:06.052 --> 33:08.287
I can't.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.130
SAL:
There she is.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.099
SUSAN:
Okay, we see you.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.568
Oh, my God.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.649
Kimmy.

33:37.683 --> 33:38.784
You all right?

33:38.817 --> 33:39.785
Kimmy,

33:39.818 --> 33:41.420
honey, you showed poor judgment.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.754
Poor judgment?

33:42.788 --> 33:44.656
What kind of a friend
leaves you at a party?

33:44.690 --> 33:45.357
Dad, stop.

33:45.391 --> 33:46.658
Let's go.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.260
You used to be on top
of these kind of things.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.128
We talked about this.

33:49.161 --> 33:50.396
Talked about what?

33:50.429 --> 33:51.663
You promised me
that you wouldn't let

33:51.697 --> 33:53.465
anything fall
between the cracks.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.067
You're the one who
said she could go.
Oh...

33:55.101 --> 33:56.335
No, we made a deal.
Dad, don't yell at her.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.436
Hang on.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.604
Why don't you
just say it?

33:58.637 --> 34:00.839
You resent me
for going back to work.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.442
SAL:
That's a nice little bait-
and-switch you pulled, Susan.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.777
Dad, stop.
SUSAN:
How stupid could I be?

34:05.811 --> 34:09.381
I actually thought you
would be proud of me.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.417
Work does not give you
a free pass

34:11.450 --> 34:12.451
from being a mother
and a wife.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.153
Dad, you are such a hypocrite!

34:14.186 --> 34:17.656
You're the one who's screwing
that news reporter!

34:26.298 --> 34:28.400
Mom.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.675
Susan.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.678
KIMMY:
I'm sorry.

34:39.711 --> 34:42.548
SUSAN:
Take your (bleep) pearls.

34:48.287 --> 34:50.656
CHICKIE:
Who is that?

34:50.689 --> 34:54.426
A friend of his,
I guess.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.427
You all right?

34:55.461 --> 34:57.596
Yeah, yeah.

34:57.629 --> 35:00.766
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
call in and deduct out.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.534
I'm not finishing
the shift.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.203
Who is that, John?

35:04.236 --> 35:06.505
It's one of my dealers.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.243
(groans)

35:11.277 --> 35:13.245
Let's go.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.183
(sighs)

35:20.919 --> 35:23.155
(sighs)

35:50.216 --> 35:52.751
I want you out of here
in the morning.

36:11.803 --> 36:15.774
He said that was his dealer.

36:15.807 --> 36:19.345
He was just
messing around.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.680
(scoffs)

36:21.713 --> 36:23.915
You know what?
Your partner's in trouble.

36:23.949 --> 36:27.819
You'd better get him some help
because if you don't...

36:29.755 --> 36:31.857
...he's going to take you
down with him.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.726
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.335
That was a long day.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.437
They're all long.

36:45.471 --> 36:47.873
Did you make
the arrest?

36:47.906 --> 36:50.476
Financial problems.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.612
The parents weren't rich,
but the house was paid for.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.815
I guess somebody wanted
their inheritance early.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.954
I can't do this.

37:03.922 --> 37:07.893
I thought I
could, but...

37:07.926 --> 37:11.897
I think I'm done.

37:11.930 --> 37:15.734
Russ, there are other jobs
in the department.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.035
I know.

37:17.068 --> 37:21.973
I just... I got a lot
to handle right now.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.481
You know I love you, Lyd.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.322
I love you, too, Russ.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.895
Wine.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.764
Hi.
Hey.

37:45.797 --> 37:49.034
I'm so sorry I couldn't
get off, um, but I,

37:49.067 --> 37:50.902
I picked you up
some Epsom salts

37:50.936 --> 37:54.706
and a cold
compress and...

37:55.774 --> 37:58.610
(chuckles)

37:58.644 --> 38:01.947
Ten milligrams, 660.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.849
Yeah, if you take
more than two

38:03.882 --> 38:07.085
of those at a time, you are
going to screw up your liver.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.721
All right?

38:12.624 --> 38:16.895
Hey, um... did you give
any more thought

38:16.928 --> 38:19.665
to what we talked about
this morning?

38:20.732 --> 38:23.034
Yeah, um...

38:25.036 --> 38:27.305
The answer's no.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.342
(sighing)

38:35.981 --> 38:38.784
Okay.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.024
(locks door)

38:46.057 --> 38:48.527
(car radio playing music)

38:48.560 --> 38:51.997
*

38:52.030 --> 38:53.532
(turns off stereo)

38:53.565 --> 38:55.701
(turn signal ticking)

39:11.550 --> 39:14.019
Yeah, I'm an off-duty
police officer requesting backup

39:14.052 --> 39:16.588
on Mulholland and Laurel Pass.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.056
Possible rape suspect.

39:18.089 --> 39:22.861
I've got a black Ford
Crown Victoria with bull bars,

39:22.894 --> 39:24.029
vehicle license:

39:24.062 --> 39:28.600
3-John-Robert-Q-1-5-8.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.569
Thanks.

39:31.637 --> 39:35.407
(turns off engine)

39:42.914 --> 39:44.850
(car door closes)

39:56.995 --> 39:59.498
(rustling)

40:23.154 --> 40:25.557
(footsteps)

40:40.506 --> 40:42.107
Police.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.709
Look, look,
listen, listen.
Put the rock down right now!

40:43.742 --> 40:44.776
I'm a cop, too.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.612
Drop it.
Look, I'm a cop.

40:46.645 --> 40:47.679
Get down on the ground.

40:47.713 --> 40:50.616
All right, okay, all right.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.853
(grunts)

40:58.624 --> 41:01.159
(panting)

41:02.227 --> 41:05.030
(panting)

41:12.738 --> 41:14.706
(both grunting)

41:29.621 --> 41:32.724
You think you're a cop?!

41:33.692 --> 41:36.628
(groaning)

41:36.662 --> 41:38.296
You're no cop.
(siren approaching)

41:38.329 --> 41:40.732
I'm a cop.

41:40.766 --> 41:42.067
I'm the cop.
