02:35.771 --> 02:37.980

that we're servicing
black and brown kids

02:39.938 --> 02:41.147

to the group?

09:05.564 --> 09:07.439
Yesterday's meeting, right?

09:08.980 --> 09:12.063
Joanne?
How defensive she got.

09:12.147 --> 09:16.646
It's like, "Sorry.
Just accept your logo's
super-racist."

09:16.730 --> 09:18.855
Yeah, and more
importantly, ugly.

09:18.938 --> 09:20.230
That was my main concern.

09:20.314 --> 09:21.938
I just don't want
We Got Y'all

09:22.022 --> 09:23.022
to come off
as tone-deaf right now.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.314
How we're perceived

09:24.397 --> 09:25.855
will definitely affect
our funding.

09:25.938 --> 09:27.605
Yeah, the schools I called
brought up a ton of issues.

09:27.688 --> 09:29.230
It's not
just the logo.

09:29.314 --> 09:31.230
I get that we don't
want to lose our donors,

09:31.314 --> 09:33.480
but the schools are always
gonna complain about something.

09:33.564 --> 09:36.314
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
their complaints aren't valid.

09:36.397 --> 09:38.439
Well, if it's an issue
for some  people,

09:38.522 --> 09:40.314
maybe those people
who it's an issue for

09:40.397 --> 09:42.105
should have spoken up.

09:42.188 --> 09:43.855
Really?

09:43.938 --> 09:46.188
I have to speak up
about every issue.

09:46.272 --> 09:48.063
Do you know how
awkward that is?

09:48.147 --> 09:50.564
"Hi, I'm Issa,
and I'm black and angry!"

09:50.646 --> 09:53.272
- We should all be angry.
- Ken: What's the problem?

09:53.355 --> 09:55.397
I represent the gays,
and you represent black people.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.896
I don't want to be the voice
of all  black people.

09:57.980 --> 09:59.105

10:21.147 --> 10:23.397
I was gonna go to Costco later

10:23.480 --> 10:25.688
to pick up some paper towels
for the house.

10:25.771 --> 10:28.938
Do you have a preference

10:29.022 --> 10:31.272
Uh, I'm cool with whatever.

10:31.355 --> 10:32.439
OK.

10:32.522 --> 10:34.980
Easy on the ply.

10:35.063 --> 10:36.272
Anyway,

10:36.355 --> 10:38.564
so, I talked to Kelli

10:38.646 --> 10:40.980
about my finances, and...

10:41.063 --> 10:43.938
although I am...

I need to be right now.

10:50.771 --> 10:52.022
What's that mean?

10:52.105 --> 10:53.980
It's just... taking me

10:54.063 --> 10:57.105
a little bit longer
to find my own place.

10:57.188 --> 10:58.980
And...

10:59.063 --> 11:00.896
you know I hate to ask,

11:00.980 --> 11:03.314
but is there any way
I can stay with you

11:03.397 --> 11:04.896
a couple weeks longer?

11:06.355 --> 11:08.063
'Cause, you know,
I will reimburse you

11:08.147 --> 11:09.564

on my feet.

11:11.813 --> 11:13.230
Issa, honestly,

11:13.314 --> 11:15.188
me and Vanessa, you know,

11:15.272 --> 11:18.730
she's not really cool with you
being around all the time.

11:20.063 --> 11:22.063
Oh... oh.

11:23.896 --> 11:25.813
OK, um...

11:25.896 --> 11:27.646
So maybe
I could give you just...

11:27.730 --> 11:30.522
you know, another week,
but then, you know...

11:30.605 --> 11:32.771
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's great. Of course.

11:32.855 --> 11:34.522
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:34.605 --> 11:36.771
- ( disconnects )
- Well, I'll see you-- OK.

11:48.771 --> 11:50.147
I really think
it'd be helpful

11:50.230 --> 11:51.730
if we had some
different voices here.

11:51.813 --> 11:53.397
We service
black and brown kids,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.147
but our office
doesn't look like that.

11:55.230 --> 11:58.813
And I really think
we need to hire
some employees of color.

11:58.896 --> 12:02.605
Well, what about Sarah?
She's, um...

12:04.938 --> 12:05.938
Yeah.

12:06.022 --> 12:07.980
Yeah. Look,

12:08.063 --> 12:11.272
I know I'm not out
in the field right now,

12:11.355 --> 12:14.730

anything I can do to help,

12:14.813 --> 12:15.771
please let me know.

Won't He Do It?
( laughs )

13:11.188 --> 13:12.564
Actually, I did it.

13:12.646 --> 13:14.771
- With his grace.

Niggas is just flaky, man.

13:25.980 --> 13:27.480

13:27.564 --> 13:29.439
My boy 5even was supposed
to introduce me

13:29.522 --> 13:32.230
to this artist tonight,
but now he can't go.

13:32.314 --> 13:35.230
- Can't you still go?
- I don't even know dude.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.980
What is he,
like a big deal
or somethin'?

13:38.063 --> 13:40.813
Yeah.
But, you know...

13:40.896 --> 13:42.564
it's whatever.

13:45.230 --> 13:46.564
Excuse me.

13:49.272 --> 13:50.688
Wh-Where are the cups?

13:50.771 --> 13:52.688
Oh, I just moved them
by the fridge.

Nah, you-- you ain't
gotta do all that.
