WEBVTT

03:07.605 --> 03:08.690
- Radar!
- Yes, sir.

03:08.773 --> 03:10.709
- Get a hold of Major Burns.
- I guess I better call Major Burns.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.127
- Tell him we have to hold…
- Tell him to put another

03:12.151 --> 03:13.796
- day surgeon on night shift.
- … a couple of surgeons

03:13.820 --> 03:14.922
over from the day shift
onto the night shift.

03:14.946 --> 03:16.090
I'll put in a call to
General Hammond in Seoul.

03:16.114 --> 03:17.258
Get General Hammond in Seoul,

03:17.282 --> 03:18.592
tell him we gotta have
two new surgeons right away.

03:18.616 --> 03:19.718
I hope he sends us
those two new surgeons.

03:19.742 --> 03:20.869
We're sure gonna need them.

03:20.952 --> 03:23.538
- What was that, sir?
- I gave everything to Radar.

03:23.621 --> 03:24.747
What?

04:44.202 --> 04:47.622
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- What? I'm just…

04:47.705 --> 04:50.416
Just because you're captain,
don't think you run the joint.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.418
- Come on…
- I run it.

04:52.502 --> 04:55.230
- Yeah, all right. I'm just supposed to…
- I know what you're supposed to do.

04:55.254 --> 04:59.258
Your driver will be with you shortly.
He's having his coffee now.

05:04.931 --> 05:06.557
Racist.

05:07.058 --> 05:11.479
<i>Attention. The following men,
report to the departure area.</i>

05:11.896 --> 05:15.650
<i>Carey, Michael S, Phelps, Robert A,</i>

05:15.733 --> 05:20.530
<i>Colbert T, Cleaver, Herschell B,</i>

05:21.155 --> 05:22.615
<i>Roosevelt, Charles B…</i>

05:22.699 --> 05:24.218
- Goodbye, ladies. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

05:24.242 --> 05:26.577
- So long.
<i>- Roosevelt B,</i>

05:27.161 --> 05:31.541
<i>Govowska, Theodore G, Miller…</i>

05:31.749 --> 05:35.086
- 4077th MASH?
- This is the jeep, yeah.

05:36.045 --> 05:37.380
All right.

05:39.716 --> 05:41.426
Okay, let's go, boy.

05:43.845 --> 05:45.513
Get my other bag.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.392
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

06:12.331 --> 06:16.127
Schermerhorn! Get that son of a bitch!
He just stole my jeep.

06:16.961 --> 06:20.298
Hey! Watch what the hell you're doing,
will you?

06:28.389 --> 06:32.143
- What the hell…
- What do you mean, it wasn't…

07:11.516 --> 07:15.228
- Where is she?
- I couldn't stand it…

07:15.311 --> 07:18.439
- Not another. Another…
- … for my period…

07:18.523 --> 07:21.067
There you are, sir. The officers' mess.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.653
Perhaps you would like
to take a small <i>repas.</i>

07:24.320 --> 07:27.657
I don't think I could eat after that ride
you gave me. You want any of this?

07:27.740 --> 07:30.118
No, thank you, sir,
but I could do with my lunch.

07:30.201 --> 07:33.746
Well, why don't you come on in with me
and get a sandwich?

07:33.830 --> 07:36.040
I'll follow you anywhere, sir.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.135
How about that piece of scenery,
Yankee, huh?

07:47.218 --> 07:48.469
Yes, sir.

07:50.138 --> 07:51.681
Really a drag.

08:03.943 --> 08:06.362
- No. No.
- When they cut it out, she looked fabulous.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.157
Who are those men?
Friends of yours, Murrhardt?

08:09.240 --> 08:13.327
- No, sir. First time I've ever seen them.
- Well, maybe those are the replacements.

08:13.411 --> 08:17.206
Don't be silly. We're expecting
some really sharp surgeons.

08:17.290 --> 08:19.709
Well, I guess
they just got separated from their unit

08:19.792 --> 08:22.211
and are looking for something to eat.

08:22.295 --> 08:26.090
They've got a hell of a nerve.
Coming in here, eating our food.

08:29.927 --> 08:33.806
Pardon me, can I ask you
to move over just a little bit? Thank you.

08:33.890 --> 08:35.349
- Be careful with that.
- Yeah.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.744
- But, you know, she's got to use…
- I think I'm in love.

08:37.768 --> 08:41.480
… that Phisohex soap on her face.
She really needs something drying.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.417
- She really has a bad complexion.
- Acne, it really is.

08:43.441 --> 08:46.819
- But she's got a bad complexion…
- She won't use soap.

08:46.903 --> 08:50.865
Well, you see, the truth is, Lieutenant,
I don't have anything to do tonight.

08:50.948 --> 08:55.077
I just got into town and, well,

08:55.161 --> 08:56.787
I thought maybe
you could show me around.

08:56.871 --> 08:59.183
Captain, I think if you'll notice
the lieutenant's beautiful hand,

08:59.207 --> 09:01.709
she is definitely married.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.880
Well, I'm the commanding officer,
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

09:05.963 --> 09:09.008
Boy, Bandini, they're eating here
because they wanted to.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.886
<i>Captain Murrhardt,
please report to the commander's…</i>

09:11.969 --> 09:13.488
<i>The office of the commanding officer…</i>

09:13.512 --> 09:17.934
- You men just passing through?
- I was just enjoying that lovely dish there.

09:18.434 --> 09:22.355
Captain, you are speaking about
a lieutenant in the United States Army.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.565
I'm Colonel Blake.

09:25.775 --> 09:28.861
Colonel, I'm Duke Forrest, your new cutter.

09:28.945 --> 09:32.323
- That's my driver over here.
- Captain Hawkeye Pierce.

09:32.907 --> 09:34.575
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, I am.

09:34.659 --> 09:37.304
- Good afternoon, Lieutenant Dish.
- Good afternoon, Captain Hawkeye.

09:37.328 --> 09:39.914
Captain Hawkeye Pierce,
I had a TWX about you.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.458
It seems that you stole a jeep
up at headquarters.

09:42.541 --> 09:46.379
No, no, no, sir. No, I didn't steal a jeep.
No, it's right outside. Right there.

09:46.462 --> 09:47.713
So it is.

09:47.797 --> 09:50.967
Captain Forrest, don't you know that
when you report to your new duty station,

09:51.050 --> 09:53.886
you go to your commanding officer
with a copy of your orders?

09:54.345 --> 09:56.639
Captain Pierce, is it?

09:56.722 --> 09:59.308
Captain Pierce and me
have been boozing all day…

09:59.392 --> 10:02.144
Good. Good.
You've been working close to the front.

10:02.228 --> 10:03.854
Now we have our slack periods here,

10:03.938 --> 10:06.816
but when the action starts,
you'll get more work in 12 hours…

10:06.899 --> 10:08.693
How many nurses
do we have on the base, sir?

10:08.776 --> 10:10.778
- 17.
- How many nurses will there be on my…

10:10.861 --> 10:12.839
- Four, then a civilian surgeon.
- … young girl here…

10:12.863 --> 10:13.966
- A dozen a month.
- I'd like her as my nurse.

10:13.990 --> 10:15.759
- Yes, I think that could be arranged.
- I could use her.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.463
And the young girl, over here, the blonde.

10:17.535 --> 10:21.831
Father Mulcahy, I'd like you to meet
Captain Pierce, our new surgeon.

10:21.914 --> 10:24.792
This is the Catholic chaplain.
And here's Captain Forrest.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.377
- Dago Red.
- Dago Red!

10:26.460 --> 10:29.547
- Captain Waldowski, our dental officer.
- I'm better known as Painless Pole.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.275
This is Captain Black,
our anesthesiologist.

10:31.299 --> 10:33.134
I'm Painless Pole. I'm the dentist here.

10:33.217 --> 10:36.304
- John Black. I'll be passing gas for you.
- Duke? Welcome.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.472
- Captain Bandini, here.
- Thank you.

10:38.556 --> 10:40.975
- John Black. How are you?
- I'm proud of that man.

10:41.058 --> 10:45.313
- If you boys have any problems, my tent…
- Bandini, here. Duke, glad to meet you.

10:45.396 --> 10:48.399
I was saying if you boys
have any problems, my tent is right…

10:48.482 --> 10:50.234
Radar! O'Reilly.

10:50.318 --> 10:52.403
Gentlemen, I'm Corporal O'Reilly.
They call me Radar.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.381
- You'll be staying in Major Burns' tent.
- Major Burns' tent.

10:54.405 --> 10:56.591
- I'll take your things over there now.
- Everything out of the jeep.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.385
Don't worry about the jeep,
I'll change the numbers.

10:58.409 --> 11:00.119
And change the numbers on that jeep.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.840
Corporal O'Reilly,
you're not billeting these enlisted men

11:12.923 --> 11:14.550
in the officers' area, now, are you?

11:19.430 --> 11:20.848
Excuse me.

11:21.599 --> 11:22.951
I'm collecting for my blind brother

11:22.975 --> 11:25.787
- who can't afford the trip to Korea.
- Don't you trust that man. He's a mad dog.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.730
- He'll do anything.
- Unhand me, sir.

11:28.606 --> 11:30.441
Hey, Duke Forrest.

11:40.284 --> 11:42.203
Now, that one's mine.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.753
- Hi, fellas.
- Who? That one?

11:51.087 --> 11:52.505
- Yeah.
- Who told you that?

11:52.588 --> 11:57.218
- How do you know that?
- "Yea, though I walk through the valley

11:57.301 --> 12:00.429
"of the shadow of death,

12:00.513 --> 12:04.683
"I will fear no evil, for thoo art with me."

12:04.767 --> 12:06.811
Thou. "Thou art with me."

12:06.894 --> 12:08.938
- Jesus Christ.
- What's all that about?

12:09.021 --> 12:12.191
That's Major Burns, sir. Excuse me.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.196
- New personnel, Major.
- Good.

12:17.279 --> 12:20.825
- Hiya. Hawkeye Pierce.
- How do you do?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.910
- Duke Forrest.
- Frank Burns.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.621
- How are you?
- Go ahead, Ho-Jon.

12:27.498 --> 12:30.376
"My cup runneth over.

12:30.960 --> 12:35.756
"Surely goodness and mercy

12:35.840 --> 12:39.218
- "shall follow…"
- What's this here?

12:39.301 --> 12:41.262
This is Ho-Jon.
He's one of our mess-hall boys.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.763
I'm teaching him how to read.

12:42.847 --> 12:47.476
Is that right?
Reading the Bible, huh? That's nice.

12:48.144 --> 12:51.480
Listen, I'll tell you what. I got a book here.
It's got a lot of pictures in it,

12:51.564 --> 12:54.525
and I think it's easier to learn how to read
when you look at pictures.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.861
A little adventure in pictures.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.572
- May I leave now, Major?
- Sure, Ho-Jon.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.657
You have fun, you hear?

13:06.495 --> 13:08.706
There it is. Suture, Mary.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.835
What kind of sutures are these?

13:12.918 --> 13:16.064
- I can't see what the hell I'm doing.
- Storch, I need some more sponge clamps.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.607
- Give me…
- Okay. Just a minute, Les.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.217
- Okay.
- Give me some big hunks of sponge

13:20.301 --> 13:22.571
or something, for crying out loud,
and get that thing right in there.

13:22.595 --> 13:23.738
Also some big sponges.
You'll have to use these.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.973
That's bleeding. That's gotta come out.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.058
I can't stop that bleeding down there.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.856
- What's so funny?
- Nothing, sir. Not a thing.

13:33.939 --> 13:37.693
- Is that true what I hear about you?
- Duke, back to the kidney. Come on.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.487
- Yeah.
- He's cute.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.114
Give me a clamp. Give me a clamp.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.660
- Here we go.
- Captain Pierce, did you call me?

13:46.994 --> 13:49.330
No, I didn't, and my name's Hawkeye.
Give me the saw.

13:49.413 --> 13:52.666
I can't really see.
It's like the Mississippi River down there.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.853
- Give me another one.
- Doesn't feel like it's in one piece,

13:54.877 --> 13:57.171
I'll tell you that.
I think it's gotta come out of there.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.089
Get in. Get in there.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.927
And give me some more
of that gauze wrapped up there.

14:03.761 --> 14:06.222
Here. It won't stick otherwise.

14:08.057 --> 14:10.768
Big, honey. It's… You know, this thing…

14:10.935 --> 14:13.187
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.982
- Nurse, you got a clamp, please?
- Yes, sir.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.821
Scratch my nose. Just there.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.616
There. A little harder, please.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.118
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

14:28.202 --> 14:32.414
<i>All non-commissioned…
Attention. Attention.</i>

14:32.957 --> 14:37.211
<i>All non-commissioned officers will report
for short-arm inspection at 0400.</i>

14:37.503 --> 14:38.921
<i>That is all.</i>

14:42.132 --> 14:44.927
- What's that?
- That's a martini, Frank.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.721
Finest kind.
We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender.

14:47.805 --> 14:51.225
- Would you care to imbibe, sir?
- I don't drink.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.852
Jesus Christ, I think he means it.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.897
- I think we've been had, Hawkeye.
- I think you're right, babe.

14:56.981 --> 15:00.734
I don't think it's right to involve a boy
who's not 17 years old yet.

15:00.818 --> 15:02.903
- You go to sleep now?
- Yeah.

15:02.987 --> 15:04.905
- I go wash clothes.
- Okay.

15:05.155 --> 15:09.410
Hey, you make a mean martini there,
Ho-Jon. You keep it up, you hear?

15:18.502 --> 15:21.255
"Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

15:21.338 --> 15:24.758
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven…"

15:24.842 --> 15:27.595
You ever catch this syndrome before,
babe?

15:27.678 --> 15:31.390
No, not with anyone beyond the age
of eight years old, I haven't.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.935
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

15:35.019 --> 15:39.773
"For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen."

15:40.608 --> 15:42.484
- Amen.
- Amen.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.614
And dear God, protect
our young men on the field of battle,

15:46.697 --> 15:49.325
that they may return home
to their dear ones.

15:49.408 --> 15:52.995
And dear God, protect
our supreme commander on the field

15:53.078 --> 15:55.956
and our commander-in-chief
in Washington DC.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.543
Frank, were you on this religious kick
at home or did you crack up over here?

15:59.877 --> 16:02.463
Frank, how long does this show go on?

16:03.547 --> 16:05.132
It gets longer all the time.

16:05.215 --> 16:08.636
Now I have your soul to pray for
and Captain Pierce's.

16:08.719 --> 16:12.765
<i>Onward, Christian soldiers</i>

16:12.848 --> 16:16.352

16:59.603 --> 17:01.188

- What's the line-up?

17:01.271 --> 17:03.982
Four waiting for surgery,
two waiting for the IV,

17:04.066 --> 17:06.527
and two waiting for the antibiotics
to take over.

17:06.609 --> 17:10.656
We can probably handle that
if there's no more choppers. Pickup.

17:12.825 --> 17:14.201
Scissors.

17:16.787 --> 17:17.931
- Hi, ladies.
- Now, wait a second.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.684
- You can't go in the colonel's office.
- That's who we're looking for, Dave.

17:20.708 --> 17:22.209
Henry, you gotta do something.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.752
We have stuck it out
for a whole week now. Pretty girl.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.089
Yeah, she kind of grows on you.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.550
- What is it, men?
- That sky pilot.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.219
You have got to get him out of our tent.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.346
- Your tent?
- Yeah. Get that nurse in there.

17:34.430 --> 17:37.266
She doesn't look like the kind who'd
keep you awake all night praying.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.767
I've been in the army a long time.

17:38.851 --> 17:42.730
I know what you guys are trying to pull,
but you're not gonna push me around.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.940
Henry, not for the world
would I push you around,

17:45.023 --> 17:47.377
but, look, there is one more thing,
now that you're talking about it.

17:47.401 --> 17:48.402
We need a chest cutter.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.714
Yeah. We gotta get an A-one chest cutter
in here quick, Henry,

17:50.738 --> 17:52.173
or we're gonna be in
a hell of a lot of trouble.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.324
Forget it.
No MASH unit has a chest surgeon.

17:54.408 --> 17:55.701
We're not about to get one.

17:55.784 --> 17:56.827
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?

17:56.910 --> 17:59.264
They're behind in the OR,
and the pre-op ward is all jammed up.

17:59.288 --> 18:02.291
<i>The helicopters and the ambulances
are coming in full.</i>

18:02.374 --> 18:04.668
<i>You guys are gonna have to go to work
early today.</i>

18:04.752 --> 18:07.129
<i>And add overtime to a 12-hour day?
What the hell is that?</i>

18:07.212 --> 18:09.274
<i>The union'll raise all kinds of Cain
with you, Henry.</i>

18:09.298 --> 18:11.967
<i>Boy, Henry, you work those kind of hours,
you sure need your rest.</i>

18:12.050 --> 18:14.446
<i>And you can't get them with
a sky pilot jabbering to heaven all day.</i>

18:14.470 --> 18:16.597
<i>Major Burns will be out of your tent
in 24 hours.</i>

18:16.680 --> 18:19.349
<i>Tell him Captain Pierce
and Captain Forrest are on the way.</i>

18:19.892 --> 18:21.435
<i>Henry, there's just one more thing.</i>

18:21.518 --> 18:24.438
<i>I told you Major Burns will be out
of your tent in 24 hours.</i>

18:24.521 --> 18:26.106
<i>- The chest cutter.
- No.</i>

18:27.941 --> 18:30.152
<i>I'll try, damn it.
You can't ask any more than that.</i>

18:39.495 --> 18:41.747
Pull that back. Put your little finger in.

18:45.209 --> 18:48.337
My abdominal operation was doing fine.
It's the head wound that did him in.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.297
Dish, get over here and hold this retractor.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.882
- Okay.
- No. No, no…

18:51.965 --> 18:53.717
Dish, let me have a long needle holder.

18:55.594 --> 18:56.887
Go ahead.

19:01.058 --> 19:04.228
- Dago!
- Amen.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.605
- Pull it back, Duke.
- Hell, I can't…

19:07.397 --> 19:08.982
- Get hold of the other one.
- Dago.

19:09.066 --> 19:12.402
Dago, I want you over here
to hold this retractor. Now.

19:12.486 --> 19:15.030
- Please, come on. Now.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.490
- Hi, Dago.
- Hey, hold on.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.092
- My hand…
- Don't wiggle it. Just hold on.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.284
Clamp.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.330
I'm sorry, Dago, but this man's still alive,

19:23.413 --> 19:25.707
and that other man is dead,
and that's a fact.

19:25.791 --> 19:29.419
Can you hold it with two fingers, Dago?
Hell. Where the hell… Did you see it?

19:35.717 --> 19:38.277
- Sergeant, you know where Hawkeye is?
- You mean Captain Pierce?

19:38.303 --> 19:42.099
- No, I'd have to look at the duty roster.
- They're in there.

19:43.517 --> 19:44.810
Oh, baby.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.688
Hawkeye, you gotta remember
I'm married.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.190
I'm married. I'm happy. I love my wife.
If she was here,

19:50.274 --> 19:52.252
- I would be with her.
- I am, too. I'm very happily married.

19:52.276 --> 19:55.779
There is no question of loving anybody.
It is a question only of helping…

19:55.863 --> 19:59.157
You see, I made a vow to myself
that while I was gone,

19:59.283 --> 20:03.120
I was gonna be faithful to my husband.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.000
Those are the vows you make
when you're with somebody.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.627
Hawkeye?

20:12.921 --> 20:15.966
- Ho-Jon?
- Duke say you better haul ass home quick.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.802
- We got a new chest cutter in our tent.
- Okay.

20:21.138 --> 20:27.060
<i>This is Radio Tokyo bringing you
musical interlude for your enjoyment.</i>

21:05.849 --> 21:09.811
- That's him.
- Hiya. I'm Hawkeye Pierce.

21:10.812 --> 21:15.108
Yeah. See? So all I can get out of him
is he's from Boston,

21:15.192 --> 21:17.402
and he's been in the army two months.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.863
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And that's all.

21:35.462 --> 21:39.549
Well, listen, where were you
when you were drafted?

21:40.717 --> 21:42.928
I was just curious.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.266
Back home. I told you before.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.643
No, I mean, what were you doing?

21:49.726 --> 21:53.397
Were you like a resident
or on staff some place?

21:55.941 --> 21:57.192
Where?

21:58.318 --> 21:59.569
Hospital.

22:00.404 --> 22:01.947
Which hospital?

22:02.656 --> 22:03.991
Back home.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.910
Is there some reason
I shouldn't know which hospital?

22:06.994 --> 22:09.162
I don't know. I will ask.

22:09.246 --> 22:13.625
Is there some reason my friend
should not know the name of the hospital?

22:15.919 --> 22:19.548
There doesn't appear to be any reason.
I've seen you somewhere before.

22:19.631 --> 22:23.468
I don't know your name, stranger,
but your face is familiar.

22:23.552 --> 22:26.054
Have you always had that moustache?

22:28.557 --> 22:32.227
Are you a beer drinker, sir, or would
you like to share a martini with me?

22:32.310 --> 22:34.896
Martini, that would be… I'd love a martini.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.816
Ho-Jon, give the gentleman a martini.

22:37.899 --> 22:41.695
I think you will find these accommodating.
They're quite dry.

22:43.822 --> 22:46.158
Don't you use olives?

22:46.241 --> 22:48.368
Olives? Where the hell
do you think you are, man?

22:48.452 --> 22:50.746
We do have to make
certain concessions to the war.

22:50.829 --> 22:52.473
We're three miles from the frontline and…

22:52.497 --> 22:55.709
Yes, but a man can't really
savor his martini

22:55.792 --> 22:57.836
without an olive, you know.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.505
Otherwise, you see, it just

23:02.674 --> 23:05.343
doesn't quite make it.

23:06.094 --> 23:11.767
<i>Attention. The Evangelical United
Brethren Church has donated 34 hymnals</i>

23:11.850 --> 23:14.311
<i>to the 4077th MASH unit.</i>

23:14.686 --> 23:18.231
<i>These hymnals are located
in the camp library</i>

23:18.315 --> 23:20.734
<i>and may be checked out
by those with cards.</i>

23:20.817 --> 23:22.194
<i>That is all.</i>

23:22.444 --> 23:26.615
Listen, am I going to get paid
for giving you guys lessons? Rib cutter.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.953
Small bones, huh?

23:33.914 --> 23:37.167
- I need a retractor also, nurse.
- Let's get her, baby.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.711
What do you think? Can I tie this for you?

23:42.089 --> 23:44.925
- You need some suction?
- Yeah, that's fine.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.511
Here, pickups for me, please.

23:49.346 --> 23:52.057
- How's he doing, John?
- He's doing well.

23:52.224 --> 23:54.935
- You're doing a live suture.
- Yeah, looks like that's it.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.812
Looks like that's it.

23:58.105 --> 24:00.774
What the hell did you do with our thread?
It ran out.

24:00.857 --> 24:03.610
- More thread, please, and larger needles.
- Will you let me?

24:03.985 --> 24:07.531
- Let me have another suture.
- You surgeons are all alike, I tell you that.

24:09.199 --> 24:12.536
If this guy knew the clowns who are
operating on him, I think he'd faint.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.847
- I think he has!
- Come on, nurse. I need a suture, please.

24:14.871 --> 24:17.040
- Coming.
- Keep ahead of him, babe, will you?

24:17.124 --> 24:19.292
And we need a couple
more stitches in there.

24:19.376 --> 24:21.545
That's fine, yeah. Thank you.

24:21.837 --> 24:22.837
Just turn it around.

24:22.879 --> 24:26.109
It's a good thing you have a nice body,
nurse, otherwise we'd get rid of you quick.

24:26.133 --> 24:28.385
- Don't stick me.
- Keep it clean.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.469
Come…

24:30.887 --> 24:32.490
- You know, I can tie that for you.
- Yeah.

24:32.514 --> 24:35.100
Okay, let's have the big stitches
for holding up the chest.

24:35.183 --> 24:36.434
Fine.

24:36.518 --> 24:39.104
- Larger needles, Knocko.
- Now sutures.

24:40.605 --> 24:43.733
Start wrapping up.
I could use another one.

24:43.984 --> 24:47.070
Does anybody know if this is
an officer or an enlisted man?

24:47.154 --> 24:49.573
- He's an enlisted man.
- Make the stitches big.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.618
<i>Attention.

24:54.286 --> 24:57.622

<i>so that our rooms may look

25:24.274 --> 25:26.193
- It is you. It's you!
- What?

25:26.276 --> 25:28.528
Duke, I ever tell you
how Androscoggin College

25:28.612 --> 25:30.739
beat Dartmouth in a raging blizzard 6-0

25:30.822 --> 25:32.758
- 'cause I intercepted a pass?
- Yeah. You told me.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.701
They had this great passer, see,

25:34.784 --> 25:36.870
and we held them 0-0
till the last 20 seconds,

25:36.953 --> 25:40.707
and then, snow and all, he let one go,
and it went sailing, boom!

25:40.790 --> 25:43.269
Lucky your mouth wasn't open
or it would've gotten stuck in your throat.

25:43.293 --> 25:45.712
Oh, baby! How is Trapper John?

25:45.795 --> 25:48.298
- I thought you'd never remember!
- John McIntyre!

25:49.466 --> 25:51.676
John McIntyre! Trapper John.

25:51.801 --> 25:55.555
Only man ever found fulfillment in
a Boston Maine Railway, in the ladies' can.

25:55.639 --> 25:58.559
Conductor opened the door, the girl
looked out and yelled, "He trapped me!

25:58.600 --> 26:00.800
"Oh, my God, he trapped me!"
Honest to God. How are you?

26:00.852 --> 26:03.563
I'm great. What's going on over there?

26:03.647 --> 26:07.734
Well, well, well, must be
Painless Polish Day in the shower tent.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.569
Painless Polish Day in the shower tent?

26:09.653 --> 26:11.655
Walt Waldowski, the dentist. You met him.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.466
Well, what, are those guys waiting
to scrub his back?

26:13.490 --> 26:17.661
No. He's what you might call
the best-equipped dentist in the army.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.579
- You may call it that.
- Yeah.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.459
I saw once in med school, in pre-med.

26:24.542 --> 26:27.754
I did an autopsy on a guy. He would have
been drowned and all swollen up…

26:27.837 --> 26:29.649
- You an authority on that?
- I heard that one, too.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.525
- The most extraordinary thing.
- You told that one…

26:31.549 --> 26:33.551
And a friend of mine had a…

26:33.635 --> 26:36.554
Boy, I'd surely love to see that angry!

27:49.085 --> 27:50.253
Nurse!

27:52.964 --> 27:56.426
Boone, get me a cc of adrenaline
and a cardiac needle.

27:57.052 --> 27:59.763
- I'm sorry…
- Just get it!

28:08.688 --> 28:11.149
And you can cut me about
a four-inch piece of wire

28:11.274 --> 28:13.151
and about an inch and a half of tape.

28:18.615 --> 28:19.949
- Hi, soldier.
- Who is it?

28:20.033 --> 28:23.536
It's Trapper, Trapper. Don't worry.
Let's get some of this stuff off.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.623
You idiot! I said a cardiac needle.

28:27.999 --> 28:31.252
- You want me to get a nurse?
- It's too late, Boone. You killed him.

29:03.284 --> 29:06.746
At ease. This is Major O'Houlihan,
our new chief nurse.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.748
This is where we do the dirty work.

29:08.832 --> 29:10.959
- Captain Murrhardt.
- Sponge.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.627
- Hi.
- Hi, Captain.

29:12.710 --> 29:17.340
Dennis, don't you remember? I helped
carry your luggage from the airfield.

29:17.424 --> 29:20.260
- Oh, yes. Hello, Dennis.
- Hi.

29:20.343 --> 29:23.304
- This is Captain Black.
- Hello, Captain Black.

29:23.388 --> 29:27.434
- Hi, I'm Ugly John, your gas passer.
- Ugly John.

29:27.517 --> 29:30.311
It's only you, Judson. Captain Sacks.

29:30.728 --> 29:32.581
Hello, Captain Sacks.
How's the operation going?

29:32.605 --> 29:34.482
Are you kidding?

29:35.150 --> 29:36.401
Scissors.

29:38.111 --> 29:43.032
- And this is Captain Knocko McCarthy.
- Hello, Major. Right.

29:43.116 --> 29:47.495
Now I'll show you the rest of the
operation, if you'll excuse the pun.

29:51.249 --> 29:54.544
This is the pre-op ward.
I'll take these things.

29:54.627 --> 29:58.339
This is the post-op ward.
If you don't mind…

29:59.841 --> 30:01.551
Vollmer, take care of these, will you?

30:01.634 --> 30:04.345
- Finished work for the day?
- Yes. Why?

30:04.429 --> 30:09.142
Good, good. I just wanted to make sure
you had time to sleep this off.

30:11.895 --> 30:13.605
Son of a bitch!

30:13.688 --> 30:16.483
Trapper! Captain McIntyre!
What the hell…

30:16.566 --> 30:19.319
- That's a captain?
- What's going on? Who started this?

30:19.402 --> 30:22.238
I hit him! I hit him!
He's an ignoramus, that knucklehead!

30:22.322 --> 30:25.783
He wouldn't have touched me
if I'd had my guard up.

30:25.909 --> 30:28.995
Let us settle this, Colonel,
between ourselves. Alone!

30:29.078 --> 30:31.372
What do you think I'm running,
an English boarding school?

30:31.456 --> 30:32.749
McIntyre, you're under arrest.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.852
Confine yourself to quarters
pending an investigation.

30:34.876 --> 30:38.755
- Henry, are you kidding?
- I deeply regret this unfortunate incident.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.466
We try to remember
we're a military organization.

30:41.549 --> 30:43.843
I should certainly hope so.

30:43.927 --> 30:47.805
Vollmer, that man is under arrest.
Confine him to his quarters.

30:49.516 --> 30:53.937
- Captain McIntyre, you are officially…
- Come on. Cut it out, Vollmer.

30:57.941 --> 31:02.529
<i>Attention, camp compound.
Urine specimens will be required from all…</i>

31:04.489 --> 31:06.199
<i>Disregard last transmission.</i>

31:06.282 --> 31:09.202
- I'm sorry, Colonel.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

31:09.285 --> 31:10.846
- Henry, you want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.373
- Ho-Jon, get him some coffee.
- Well, what's wrong with you?

31:13.456 --> 31:15.333
I don't know. I must have lost my punch.

31:15.416 --> 31:17.835
I never expected
the son of a bitch to get up!

31:17.919 --> 31:19.212
That's no kind of an answer.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.606
Come on, Henry. You know why he did it.

31:20.630 --> 31:23.341
I can't have my junior officers
striking each other.

31:23.424 --> 31:27.303
Now, damn it, Henry.
Frank Burns is a menace!

31:27.637 --> 31:29.389
Every time a patient croaks on him,

31:29.472 --> 31:32.433
he says it's God's will
or somebody else's fault.

31:32.517 --> 31:35.287
Yeah, this time he blamed it on some kid
who was stupid enough to believe him.

31:35.311 --> 31:36.312
The hell with that.

31:36.396 --> 31:38.123
I'm tired of you guys
trying to run this outfit.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.567
This time, there's going to be
disciplinary action.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.569
What are you going to do, Henry?

31:42.652 --> 31:45.822
Well, I'd planned to name Trapper
chief surgeon

31:45.905 --> 31:50.034
- to consult on your shift and Frank's.
- That's damn good thinking.

31:50.118 --> 31:52.287
Yeah, but now I can't do it
for at least a week.

31:52.370 --> 31:55.456
If I announced it now after what
our new chief nurse saw this afternoon,

31:55.540 --> 31:57.959
you'd hear her yelling
from Washington to Seoul.

31:58.042 --> 31:59.669
Don't you have any sugar in this place?

32:00.420 --> 32:05.049
<i>Good morning. Today's musical
selections will be rendered by</i>

32:05.133 --> 32:08.344
<i>Achi Takamura Seamuchiwa Bobcats.</i>

32:08.845 --> 32:12.140
Colonel Blake, General Hammond
did not answer the phone, sir!

32:12.223 --> 32:14.309
They said he was at a football game.

32:14.392 --> 32:17.937
- Those generals have all the fun!
- Yes, sir.

32:49.719 --> 32:53.139
<i>Attention. Attention.
May I have the camp's attention?</i>

32:53.222 --> 32:57.393
<i>This week's movie will be</i>
When Willie Comes Marching Home.

32:58.436 --> 33:02.482
<i>The biggest parade of laughs
of World War II.</i>

33:03.024 --> 33:07.654
<i>All the loves, laughs and escapades
of the Willies who came marching home.</i>

33:08.363 --> 33:13.201
<i>This film stars Dan Dailey,
Corinne Calvet and Colleen Townsend.</i>

33:13.951 --> 33:16.245
Captain Pierce, may I join you?

33:17.288 --> 33:21.459
You've already joined me, gorgeous.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.920
Where do you come from?

33:24.420 --> 33:27.215
Well, I like to think of the army
as my home.

33:27.298 --> 33:29.050
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

33:30.760 --> 33:32.887
Ho-Jon, you bring me some ketchup,
will you?

33:32.970 --> 33:35.074
Captain, I've been observing
the nurses on your shift.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.349
Yeah, I know. I saw you.

33:36.432 --> 33:39.644
<i>Naturally, your own opinion
is more informed than mine.</i>

33:39.727 --> 33:43.481
<i>I think you would like to know what I think
of the nurses on my team. I'll tell you.</i>

33:43.564 --> 33:45.250
<i>I think they're fine.
I think they're just great,</i>

33:45.274 --> 33:46.984
<i>and I'm totally satisfied with them.</i>

33:48.486 --> 33:53.491
- Oh, no, that's the second time this week.
- Of course, what do you expect?

34:01.541 --> 34:03.501
Welcome, gentlemen.

34:04.711 --> 34:08.715
<i>- When the lights go on again
- When the lights go on again</i>

34:09.172 --> 34:11.717
<i>- All over the world
- All over the world</i>

34:11.801 --> 34:13.594
You got enough room?

34:17.139 --> 34:19.225
Get rid of the line for me.

34:19.308 --> 34:22.061
<i>All over the world
All over the world</i>

34:22.145 --> 34:26.482
- Is he all right, Hawkeye?
- Is he all right, Dago?

34:26.565 --> 34:29.694
Yes, you mean he's going to live?
He'll live.

34:31.362 --> 34:35.616
I hope somebody's going to be around
tomorrow morning when he wakes up

34:35.699 --> 34:39.996
to tell him that he hasn't got
anything between his legs anymore.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.165
Syngman Rhee's paying the light bill.

34:42.248 --> 34:46.043
- But Major Burns is far from satisfied.
- That doesn't surprise me.

34:46.127 --> 34:49.755
Frank Burns does not know his way around
an operating theater.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.924
He does not know his way around a body.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.509
And if you'll have observed anything,

34:53.592 --> 34:56.554
you'll have observed that
Major Frank Burns is an idiot.

34:56.637 --> 35:00.183
He has flipped his wig, that he is out
of his head, that he's a lousy surgeon.

35:00.266 --> 35:03.352
On the contrary, I have observed

35:03.436 --> 35:07.148
that Major Burns is not only
a good technical surgeon,

35:07.231 --> 35:10.777
- he is a good military surgeon.
- You finished?

35:10.860 --> 35:15.656
I have also noticed that nurses, as well as
enlisted men, address you as Hawkeye.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.617
Yeah, because that's my name.
Hawkeye Pierce.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.869
Well, that kind of informality
is inconsistent

35:19.952 --> 35:22.079
with maximum efficiency
in a military organization.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.040
Come off it, Major!

35:25.875 --> 35:29.045
You've put me right off my fresh fried
lobster. Do you realize that?

35:29.128 --> 35:30.630
I'm going to go back to my bed,

35:30.713 --> 35:33.508
I'm going to put away
the best part of a bottle of Scotch

35:33.591 --> 35:36.886
and under normal circumstances,
you being normally what I'd call

35:36.969 --> 35:39.138
a very attractive woman,
I would have invited you back

35:39.222 --> 35:43.309
to share my little bed with me
and you might possibly have come.

35:43.392 --> 35:45.311
But you really put me off.

35:45.394 --> 35:49.065
I mean, you're what we call
a regular army clown.

35:53.736 --> 35:56.197
I wonder how a degenerated person
like that could have reached

35:56.280 --> 35:59.367
a position of responsibility
in the army medical corps.

35:59.909 --> 36:01.077
He was drafted.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.928
- Radar!
- Your briefcase, sir.

36:19.011 --> 36:22.765
- You're going to see Hammond…
- I'm spending the day with Hammond.

36:22.849 --> 36:24.183
I'm gonna stay overnight.

36:24.267 --> 36:25.685
Major Burns'll be in charge.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.312
- Good luck.
- See you in the morning.

36:29.272 --> 36:31.750
Sir, are there any last-minute instructions
you want to give to the men?

36:31.774 --> 36:33.494
No, Radar has all
the necessary information.

36:33.568 --> 36:35.862
Yeah, but who's going to be
on CQ tonight?

36:35.945 --> 36:38.406
Wait a minute. What about the…

36:39.156 --> 36:41.075
- Captain.
- Yes, sir.

36:41.409 --> 36:44.120
I left some shirts on my bunk.
The buttons are missing.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.205
Just ask somebody
to sew them up, please.

36:46.289 --> 36:48.457
- I'd be glad to do them for you.
- You don't have to.

36:48.541 --> 36:53.421
- It's nothing, really. Great jacket. Is it new?
- Oh, yeah, my… It was sent to me.

36:53.504 --> 36:55.548
- You don't have to do that.
- Take care.

36:57.133 --> 37:01.220
<i>Hail to the chief
he's the best of all the surgeons</i>

37:01.304 --> 37:05.308
<i>- He needs a queen to satisfy his urgings
- He needs a queen to satisfy his urgings</i>

37:05.391 --> 37:09.478
<i>Hail to the chief

37:09.562 --> 37:14.317
<i>- He needs a queen to sit upon his lappers
- He needs a queen to sit upon his lappers</i>

37:14.734 --> 37:18.988
<i>Hail to the chief
he's the best of all the cutters</i>

37:19.071 --> 37:23.326
<i>He needs a queen
with a bigger pair of udders</i>

37:23.451 --> 37:24.678
<i>- Hail to the chief…
- Hail to the chief…</i>

37:24.702 --> 37:27.955
Blake's gone out of his mind.
Is that going to go on all night?

37:28.039 --> 37:32.793
<i>He took his orders
and shoved them up his rectum</i>

37:32.877 --> 37:34.712
No, no. No food. No food.

37:34.795 --> 37:39.300
- Sex. I want sex. Bring me some sex.
- Storch, Storch, come forth.

37:39.383 --> 37:42.887
- No, no, no, that one. Bring me that one.
- He's chosen you! Congratulations!

37:42.970 --> 37:47.099
That one. The sultry bitch with the fire
in her eyes. Take her clothes off.

37:47.183 --> 37:49.602
I want that one! Yes! Yes!

37:49.685 --> 37:53.522
Take her clothes off and bring her
to me now! I want her now!

37:55.858 --> 37:59.403
Doctor! Doctor!
You forgot your shingle, Doctor.

38:12.458 --> 38:18.506
"This letter has been written

38:19.715 --> 38:24.720
- "in the interest of…"
- Army morale.

38:26.430 --> 38:30.768
Good. "Army morale."

38:35.815 --> 38:37.316
Get that thing out, will you?

38:37.400 --> 38:38.442
You want to sing one, too?

38:38.526 --> 38:41.988
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Radar's going to sing us our verse.

38:44.949 --> 38:47.660
"This letter has been written
in the interest of army morale.

38:47.743 --> 38:49.745
"As officers, we feel
it is our duty to bring this

38:49.829 --> 38:52.164
"unwholesome situation
to your attention.

38:52.248 --> 38:54.226
"We are writing this letter jointly
to assure you that

38:54.250 --> 38:57.586
"no one's personal feeling
has any way influenced this report.

38:57.670 --> 38:59.564
- "Respectfully, Margaret J. Houlihan."
- That's perfect.

38:59.588 --> 39:00.649
- "Major Burns."
- That's perfect.

39:00.673 --> 39:02.508
I think it's a marvelous letter.

39:03.092 --> 39:06.262
- We make a good team, don't we?
- We think the same way.

39:06.345 --> 39:07.930
Of course we do.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.350
It's almost suppertime.

39:12.435 --> 39:15.855
- You're not hungry, are you?
- Ravenous. How about you?

39:16.814 --> 39:18.482
For you, Margaret.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.962
Now, the sooner this reaches him,

39:40.046 --> 39:43.632
the sooner we can turn this
into a tight military outfit.

39:50.514 --> 39:56.562
<i>Attention, camp compound. Corporal
Judson has informed the colonel's office</i>

39:56.645 --> 40:00.733
<i>that three cases of amphetamine sulphate
are unaccounted for again.</i>

40:00.816 --> 40:03.861
<i>This is the third occurrence
of this type in the last month.</i>

40:03.944 --> 40:06.405
<i>It must stop,
by order of Colonel Blake's office,</i>

40:06.489 --> 40:08.657
<i>4077th MASH unit.</i>

40:09.950 --> 40:13.204
I only wish I could deliver
that letter personally.

40:13.496 --> 40:16.290
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Margaret.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.918
I'll stop by later on to see if you're all right.

40:19.001 --> 40:21.837
- Why, that won't be necessary.
- No, I don't mind.

40:23.005 --> 40:24.673
I'll leave the door unlocked.

40:27.259 --> 40:30.137
<i>Attention.
Captain McIntyre will give a lecture</i>

40:30.221 --> 40:33.641
<i>on blood and fluid replacement

<i>Correction. At 021…</i>

40:36.977 --> 40:38.687
<i>At 9:00 this evening.</i>

40:41.315 --> 40:43.317
Take your hat off, Radar.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.154
- You're before the king… Queen.
- Don't get nervous, Radar.

40:50.366 --> 40:52.409
<i>Long live the chief…</i>

40:52.493 --> 40:55.538
The colonel… The colonel…

40:55.621 --> 40:59.250
<i>Long live the chief
The colonel did elect him</i>

41:00.209 --> 41:02.711
<i>But he took all his orders
And shoved them up his nose</i>

41:24.400 --> 41:27.153
- You all right?
- Fine.

41:28.571 --> 41:30.781
Godless buffoons, all of them.

41:31.031 --> 41:35.953
It's the disrespect for you, Frank.
That's what I can't forgive.

41:36.912 --> 41:38.581
I'm used to it.

41:41.208 --> 41:43.252
- Licorice?
- No, thank you.

41:45.754 --> 41:48.924
What makes me sore
is how they behave towards you.

41:49.884 --> 41:52.636
They ought to be grateful to have you.

41:55.556 --> 41:57.099
I certainly am.

41:59.935 --> 42:02.271
I'm grateful to have you, Frank.

42:08.611 --> 42:11.322
We've grown very close in a short time.

42:13.782 --> 42:17.453
It isn't just chance. I'm sure of that.

42:20.956 --> 42:23.292
God meant us to find each other.

42:24.919 --> 42:27.296
- His will be done!
- Darling!

42:28.797 --> 42:30.883
Frank! Frank!

42:35.888 --> 42:38.098
I'll help you. Oh, yes.

42:42.102 --> 42:44.772
Wait, wait. Get my robe.

42:45.272 --> 42:47.441
Get my zipper. My zipper.

42:48.234 --> 42:52.112
Oh, God! Careful, careful.

42:59.828 --> 43:02.831
Get the searchlight on. Look.

43:05.960 --> 43:08.671
Hey, put the light out.

43:10.256 --> 43:13.217
Hi. What's going on? May I join you?

43:14.009 --> 43:17.304
A little radio show from home.

43:18.973 --> 43:23.018
<i>- Yes, Frank.
- My zipper. Zipper.</i>

43:24.895 --> 43:28.565
<i>- Frank. Yes. Frank.</i>
- Is this the <i>Bickersons?</i> I love them.

43:28.649 --> 43:32.152
- Who?
<i>- The Battling Bickersons</i>. I love it.

43:35.155 --> 43:36.490
<i>Frank.</i>

43:39.034 --> 43:40.828
<i>Hard. Frank.</i>

43:41.537 --> 43:45.332
<i>Harder, harder. Oh, my God.</i>

43:48.502 --> 43:52.840
No, I forgot. No, I…

43:56.593 --> 44:00.055
- You're shining that thing in my eyes.
- I'm sorry.

44:00.723 --> 44:02.224
<i>Darling…</i>

44:02.933 --> 44:05.227
He is such a sweet man.

44:06.645 --> 44:09.732
<i>Frank! Frank, my lips are hot.</i>

44:10.441 --> 44:11.900
<i>Kiss my hot lips!</i>

44:11.984 --> 44:16.488
<i>- Yes, they are hot.</i>
- Hot? Hot Lips?

44:16.905 --> 44:20.701
We have got to share this
with the rest of the camp.

44:21.535 --> 44:24.038
- Switch it over.
- Okay.

44:24.705 --> 44:26.915
<i>Frank. Frank. Yes!</i>

44:27.166 --> 44:29.793
<i>- Darling…
- Frank.</i>

44:29.877 --> 44:32.212
<i>Frank, strangle me hard.</i>

44:32.755 --> 44:35.758
<i>- Frank!</i>
- What the hell is that?

44:36.967 --> 44:38.135
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

44:39.970 --> 44:43.432
Dr. Frank Burns is doing a bit
of dilatation and curettage.

44:47.102 --> 44:51.357
- Sounds like the major's having a dream.
- She's plugged in.

44:52.149 --> 44:55.152
<i>Major. Frank.</i>

44:56.612 --> 44:59.031
- Frank. Wait a second.
<i>- Frank. Wait a second.</i>

44:59.114 --> 45:00.157
- What is it?
<i>- What is it?</i>

45:00.240 --> 45:02.451
- Turn the light off!
<i>- Turn the light off!</i>

45:02.534 --> 45:05.746
- No! Let go! Turn the light off!
<i>- No! Let go! Turn the light off!</i>

45:06.914 --> 45:08.674
- Get your clothes on.
<i>- Get your clothes on.</i>

45:08.707 --> 45:09.768
- Get your pants on.
<i>- Get your pants on.</i>

45:09.792 --> 45:11.710
- Don't shout at me.
<i>- Don't shout at me.</i>

45:11.794 --> 45:13.712
- Don't shove me.
<i>- Don't shove me.</i>

45:28.936 --> 45:31.730
It's too bad Henry wasn't here.

45:31.814 --> 45:33.982
He would've thought it was
a real radio program.

45:34.066 --> 45:36.151
I thought it was a radio program.

45:36.235 --> 45:38.112
I think we should send
a letter of commendation

45:38.195 --> 45:40.406
to the Armed Forces Radio Network.

45:40.489 --> 45:45.369
Wonderful. Yes. It was the most
uplifting program I have ever heard.

45:45.452 --> 45:47.538
It was climactic.

45:54.253 --> 45:55.963
Morning, ladies.

46:04.138 --> 46:05.931
Well, hiya, Hot Lips.

46:07.766 --> 46:11.353
Oh, my goodness, over my…
I'm so sorry to touch you, but I…

46:14.690 --> 46:16.209
Well, what's the matter with her today?

46:16.233 --> 46:18.393
I don't know.
I think it's one of those ladies' things.

46:18.444 --> 46:21.363
- It's not like her to act like this.
- No, I mean, she's made such a…

46:21.447 --> 46:23.949
She's a bitch.
Look at my new flannel sweater.

46:24.032 --> 46:25.593
I think she's gonna have
a nervous breakdown.

46:25.617 --> 46:28.537
She can't even get out of the door. Look…

46:33.584 --> 46:35.127
Morning, Frank.

46:37.045 --> 46:38.964
Heard from your wife?

46:43.635 --> 46:45.155
Morning, Colonel,
you forgot your briefcase.

46:45.179 --> 46:46.930
Yes, I left it in the jeep.

46:47.014 --> 46:49.391
- You left it there.
- Yes. I forgot it. Got it.

46:49.475 --> 46:50.835
- Morning, Captain.
- Morning, sir.

46:50.893 --> 46:52.973
I hope you didn't have to…
Here, take care of this.

46:53.020 --> 46:56.899
I hope you didn't have to bother
with those shirts. It wasn't necessary.

46:56.982 --> 47:01.069
- Too late, sir. It's a done thing.
- Well, thank you. Morning, <i>padre.</i>

47:01.153 --> 47:03.405
You know, I really got to assume…

47:05.532 --> 47:10.621
- Colonel, sir. How was your visit, sir?
- Great. The general wasn't there.

47:12.915 --> 47:17.503
Listen, about last night, sir, there was
just nothing I could do about it, sir.

47:17.586 --> 47:19.213
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

47:19.505 --> 47:22.883
- Well, it couldn't have been helped.
- Thank you, sir.

47:23.550 --> 47:25.135
What's that?

47:25.886 --> 47:28.138
Frank Burns and Hawkeye Pierce.
Very encouraging.

47:29.264 --> 47:34.478
A bunch of the boys asked me to ask you,
Frank, what Hot Lips was like in the sack.

47:34.561 --> 47:36.080
- You know, was she…
- Mind your own business.

47:36.104 --> 47:39.858
No, Frank.
You know, is she better than self-abuse?

47:40.108 --> 47:43.695
What's that all about?
He gonna get some pointers or something?

47:43.779 --> 47:46.156
No, Hawkeye's gonna sign him up

47:46.240 --> 47:49.034
to make a personal appearance tour
in all the camps in Korea.

47:49.117 --> 47:50.410
Is that a fact?

47:50.494 --> 47:52.579
Wonder what they're saying.
Can you make it out?

47:52.663 --> 47:55.832
Does that big ass of hers
move around a lot, Frank,

47:55.916 --> 47:59.086
or does it sort of lie there flaccid?
What would you say about that?

48:00.462 --> 48:03.966
Hawkeye's questioning the major
on a point of anatomy.

48:04.049 --> 48:06.093
Very professional, exchanging ideas.

48:06.468 --> 48:08.554
Would you say that
she was a moaner, Frank?

48:10.389 --> 48:11.932
What is Burns saying?

48:12.015 --> 48:14.142
Major Burns isn't saying
much of anything, sir.

48:14.226 --> 48:16.061
I think he's formulating the answer.

48:16.144 --> 48:17.744
Seriously, Frank. I mean, does she go…

48:19.147 --> 48:22.109
Or does she just sort of lie there quiet
and not do anything at all?

48:22.192 --> 48:25.112
- Keep your filthy mouth to yourself.
- Or does she go…

48:28.240 --> 48:31.743
Get him off me! Get him off me!

48:31.827 --> 48:34.079
What's going on, Frank?
Is that lesson one?

48:34.162 --> 48:36.206
Frank Burns has gone nuts!

48:39.459 --> 48:41.086
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:41.169 --> 48:43.463
I'm wearing glasses, for God's sake!

48:43.547 --> 48:44.983
Watch out for your goodies, Hawkeye.

48:45.007 --> 48:48.135
That man is a sex maniac.
I don't think Hot Lips satisfied him.

48:48.218 --> 48:50.387
You're gonna kill him.

48:50.470 --> 48:52.848
Don't let him kiss you, Hawkeye.

49:29.843 --> 49:34.348
Colonel, fair's fair. If I nail Hot Lips
and punch Hawkeye, can I go home?

49:56.495 --> 49:58.330
- Hawkeye!
- Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

49:58.413 --> 50:00.749
- Hawkeye!
- Shit.

50:01.291 --> 50:03.377
Okay. Hey, listen, Seidman,
get another guy.

50:03.460 --> 50:05.580
We gotta take this into the OR,
just on the stretcher.

50:05.921 --> 50:08.340
Hold on, you're gonna be just fine, fella.

50:08.423 --> 50:11.176
Okay. I can't move my hand.
Now, come on.

50:12.552 --> 50:14.763
Have you got the cutdowns, darling?

50:15.681 --> 50:17.891
You're gonna go to sleep.
You're gonna be just fine.

50:17.974 --> 50:19.827
Hot Lips, let me have
one of your sterile knives, please.

50:19.851 --> 50:23.021
- I'm gonna need two vascular clamps.
- All right.

50:23.105 --> 50:24.856
And an arterial suture.

50:24.940 --> 50:26.260
As soon as you give me the clamp,

50:26.316 --> 50:28.944
I want you to be ready to gown
and glove me. All right?

50:29.027 --> 50:30.362
- Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

50:30.445 --> 50:32.531
Here we go. It's gonna spurt a bit. Okay.

50:32.614 --> 50:35.701
- You got it?
- Aye, aye, baby.

50:37.244 --> 50:38.704
- Clamp.
- Yeah.

50:43.291 --> 50:44.835
Okay, gown.

50:46.461 --> 50:49.923
- Gloves. You got an arterial suture ready?
- Yeah.

50:50.006 --> 50:53.385
Okay. Ugly, move out of the way
'cause I'm looking around over there.

50:53.468 --> 50:57.639
Baby, we're gonna see some stitching
like you never saw before!

50:58.181 --> 50:59.391
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

50:59.474 --> 51:00.618
- You got it?
- Okay. Here she goes.

51:00.642 --> 51:01.703
<i>This is Colonel Blake's office.</i>

51:01.727 --> 51:03.663
<i>- The American Medical Association…</i>
- Straight off and running.

51:03.687 --> 51:06.314
<i>… has just declared marijuana
a dangerous drug.</i>

51:06.398 --> 51:08.984
<i>Despite earlier claims by some physicians</i>

51:09.568 --> 51:12.696
<i>that it is no more harmful than alcohol,
this is now found to be the case.</i>

51:12.779 --> 51:14.030
<i>That is all.</i>

51:14.114 --> 51:15.615
Oh, really?

51:16.158 --> 51:18.201
When did you get them?
Let me try it on you.

51:18.285 --> 51:19.828
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:20.495 --> 51:24.082
Hey, Dago Reddo!
Hi. You're just in time for cocktails.

51:24.166 --> 51:26.752
- Come on in.
- No. No, thank you. I can't, really.

51:26.835 --> 51:29.588
- Hawkeye. Hawkeye.
- Okay, Red.

51:29.671 --> 51:31.548
- Could I speak to you?
- Yeah, sure.

51:31.631 --> 51:33.008
No, outside.

51:34.092 --> 51:36.720
- What?
- I have to talk to you outside.

51:40.182 --> 51:41.933
- You all right?
- Hiya, Pup-Pup.

51:43.226 --> 51:45.306
Sorry to drag you away from the gang
in there, but…

51:45.353 --> 51:48.273
- What?
- This'll only take a moment.

51:48.690 --> 51:51.276
- There's a problem with Walt Waldowski.
- Painless?

51:51.359 --> 51:53.463
- Painless.
- You got a toothache? He's a good dentist.

51:53.487 --> 51:56.990
No, no, no, it's not my problem.
See, it's his problem.

51:57.616 --> 52:01.328
- What do you mean? What is it?
- Well, what is it… That's…

52:01.411 --> 52:03.288
It's difficult to talk about, you see,

52:03.371 --> 52:07.334
because I learned about his problem
in confession.

52:07.417 --> 52:10.170
- And you can't…
- I can't divulge.

52:10.253 --> 52:12.714
- Can you give me a hint?
- But I…

52:14.090 --> 52:16.092
- Just an idea?
- Well, no.

52:17.219 --> 52:20.555
But I can tell you how serious it is.

52:21.223 --> 52:23.225
He and the boys were playing poker

52:23.308 --> 52:25.644
and one of the boys turned to him
and asked him

52:25.727 --> 52:28.939
for a ruling on one of the hands.

52:29.272 --> 52:32.150
And Walt said, he said,

52:32.234 --> 52:35.737
"What does it matter? It's only a game."

52:36.780 --> 52:39.157
Painless said,
"What does it matter? It's only a game"?

52:39.241 --> 52:41.284
- Poker, only a game?
- Yeah.

52:42.911 --> 52:44.663
Yeah, that's what I thought.

52:44.746 --> 52:47.707
I guess I better go see a man
about a tooth.

52:48.124 --> 52:49.459
Thank you.

52:49.876 --> 52:53.088
- See, I didn't know what to do.
- Pup-Pup.

52:53.964 --> 52:56.424
You see, there are some…

52:56.508 --> 52:59.511
There are some things
that absolution just…

53:00.428 --> 53:01.596
Well…

53:03.390 --> 53:05.892
Seven, eight, Jack.
Straight. Three on a low.

53:06.601 --> 53:11.189
Four, three… Hawkeye, there's
an empty chair here looking for a player.

53:11.273 --> 53:13.817
Baby, I've got a toothache
like you can't believe.

53:13.900 --> 53:17.946
Why do you bring that dog in here?
Last time you did I lost $30.

53:18.572 --> 53:21.491
Listen, why do you have to sit right
behind me? It makes me very nervous.

53:21.575 --> 53:23.410
It brings me a lot of luck. Sit there, Boone.

53:23.493 --> 53:26.663
- Come on. Let's play, man.
- Deuce. Ace.

53:27.581 --> 53:29.749
- Can I take some of your Scotch?
- Sure.

53:29.833 --> 53:31.585
- You want some?
- No.

53:34.004 --> 53:36.798
- How you feeling?
- No, no, don't touch me.

53:37.757 --> 53:39.217
Look, if…

53:40.260 --> 53:43.638
If a man isn't a man anymore,

53:45.807 --> 53:49.227
what's he got left
that he should be living for?

53:51.438 --> 53:53.565
Okay, tell me about it. What's the story?

53:53.648 --> 53:58.445
Well, you know that little nurse that was
through here last night with the 325th?

53:58.528 --> 54:01.948
- The little one with the big boobs.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

54:02.032 --> 54:03.700
Well, anyway, I…

54:04.576 --> 54:08.163
I wasn't gonna fool around out here
because I got these…

54:08.246 --> 54:11.917
I got these three girls
that I'm engaged to back home.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.337
And you wanted to be faithful to them.
Baby, you are 7,000 miles from home.

54:15.420 --> 54:20.008
Yeah, well, anyway,
I took her out last night and I failed.

54:20.926 --> 54:23.863
- You mean she wouldn't put out? Well…
- No, she wanted to, in the worst way.

54:23.887 --> 54:25.931
But it was me. I just couldn't…

54:26.014 --> 54:30.518
- You couldn't… It wouldn't…
- Yeah, nothing happened. Not at all. No.

54:30.602 --> 54:32.312
Baby, that happens to everybody.

54:32.395 --> 54:33.998
It's happened to me
maybe four or five times.

54:34.022 --> 54:35.273
It's 'cause you're tired…

54:35.357 --> 54:38.109
Yeah, well,
it's never happened to me before.

54:38.193 --> 54:41.363
Come on. You're the best-equipped dentist
in the army.

54:41.446 --> 54:45.408
- You're the dental Don Juan of Detroit.
- That's just a cover-up.

54:47.661 --> 54:49.245
- What's a cover-up?
- Don Juanism.

54:49.329 --> 54:51.349
I've been reading about it all day.
It's a cover-up.

54:51.373 --> 54:53.458
It's a cover-up for what?

54:55.377 --> 54:56.586
Well…

54:59.547 --> 55:00.966
I'm a fairy.

55:02.217 --> 55:06.596
A victim of latent homosexuality.
I've turned into a fairy.

55:15.855 --> 55:20.276
- Have you… Have you done anything?
- No, but it's only a matter of time.

55:20.568 --> 55:22.737
Boy, I just can't face it.

55:24.322 --> 55:28.743
Look, Hawkeye, suppose that
you found out that you were one, huh?

55:28.827 --> 55:29.828
- One…
- Yeah.

55:29.911 --> 55:32.998
Well, you wouldn't like breaking the news
to your wife.

55:33.081 --> 55:35.000
No, I can see that that would be a problem.

55:35.083 --> 55:38.545
Yeah, well, I got the same problem,
only multiplied.

55:39.921 --> 55:41.965
Well, you know, Man O' War,

55:42.757 --> 55:47.721
after they retired him from racing,
they put him out to stud.

55:48.888 --> 55:55.145
And he had an average of about 120,

55:55.603 --> 55:59.899
130 foals every year,

56:00.525 --> 56:02.402
and he lived to be 36.

56:02.944 --> 56:05.196
And then when he died,
they did an autopsy

56:05.280 --> 56:08.366
and they found out
that he was a raving queen.

56:10.285 --> 56:12.954
No, that's a little-known fact,
but it's the truth.

56:13.038 --> 56:15.683
Well, then, Painless has got a couple
of good years left in him, doesn't he?

56:15.707 --> 56:18.043
Maybe more.
He hasn't even started raving yet.

56:18.126 --> 56:22.005
Painless is a dentist, and a dentist
shouldn't read. That's his whole problem.

56:22.088 --> 56:24.841
His problem is that he believes it.
I mean, he really is convinced.

56:24.924 --> 56:28.845
It's an obsession, and it's a vital force.

56:30.221 --> 56:31.723
Here he comes! The jawbreaker.

56:31.806 --> 56:33.850
No, don't worry.
He's not gonna break anything.

56:33.933 --> 56:36.061
Just act natural.

56:45.070 --> 56:47.655
Hey, Painless. How's she going?

56:48.156 --> 56:50.241
Something in a marshmallow?

56:51.993 --> 56:55.205
No, it's okay, fellas.
I know you've been talking about me.

56:57.832 --> 57:01.711
Well, I came over to tell you
that I've decided that

57:01.795 --> 57:03.963
I'm going to commit suicide.

57:07.509 --> 57:10.637
Well, if you're really gonna
go ahead and do it,

57:10.845 --> 57:14.182
do you think you could leave me
your record player?

57:14.265 --> 57:16.434
- Sure.
- Thank you.

57:17.727 --> 57:20.605
Gonna miss you, Painless.
How do you plan to do it?

57:20.688 --> 57:22.565
A .45 between the eyes?

57:22.649 --> 57:25.401
- That's awful sloppy.
- It's reliable, though.

57:25.485 --> 57:28.947
Well, that's another thing
I wanted to ask you.

57:29.489 --> 57:31.574
I'm sort of new at this game, and…

57:31.658 --> 57:34.494
Do you have any particular method
that you'd recommend?

57:34.577 --> 57:38.623
I don't know. I think my colleagues and I
could come up with something

57:38.706 --> 57:41.835
- to relinquish the vital forces of their…
- Black capsule.

57:41.918 --> 57:45.046
- Black capsule.
- Of course. That's neat.

57:45.130 --> 57:48.091
What's a black capsule?
Do you have any of them? Does it work?

57:48.174 --> 57:49.801
It worked for Hitler and Eva Braun.

57:49.884 --> 57:52.204
- It should work for you.
- It's simple and it's effective.

57:52.554 --> 57:53.972
Hawkeye, I really must…

57:54.055 --> 57:56.558
I should check with
the military vicar's office.

57:56.641 --> 58:00.979
You see, I cannot give absolution to a man
who is about to commit suicide.

58:01.062 --> 58:02.230
It's a mortal sin.

58:02.313 --> 58:06.025
Look, Dago, he is not committing suicide.
He is only intending to commit suicide.

58:06.109 --> 58:08.862
So you're not dealing with an act,
you're dealing with an intention.

58:08.945 --> 58:12.323
And if it works, if what we're doing works,
then he will not commit suicide,

58:12.407 --> 58:14.659
so therefore
you're preventing a mortal sin. Okay?

58:14.742 --> 58:16.661
Well, I should check.

58:16.744 --> 58:19.455
- Well, you check on it.
- Well, there's…

59:04.250 --> 59:07.128
All right, where you at? There you go.

59:08.463 --> 59:14.677
Now, then, you've all come here
to say your final farewell to old Walt here.

59:14.969 --> 59:17.263
- Farewell, Walt.
- Dear old Walt.

59:17.430 --> 59:23.019
You know, I got an idea that maybe
it's not such a final farewell after all.

59:23.102 --> 59:27.273
I think maybe old Walt's going on
into the unknown

59:27.357 --> 59:30.193
to do a little recon work for us all.

59:30.652 --> 59:33.112
I just want to say one thing.

59:33.529 --> 59:35.740
Nobody ordered Walt
to go on this mission.

59:35.823 --> 59:38.910
- He volunteered for certain death.
- That's true.

59:38.993 --> 59:41.120
That's what we award
our highest medals for.

59:41.204 --> 59:44.958
- That's beautiful.
- That's what being a soldier is all about.

59:45.041 --> 59:47.585
- Yeah. Hear! Hear!
- Yes. Yes.

59:47.669 --> 59:52.840
Gentlemen, I think there's only one person
who has anything to add to that,

59:52.924 --> 59:56.844
- and that's Dago Red.
- The <i>padre</i>. Let's hear it for the <i>padre.</i>

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:06.854
Walt, here's your black capsule.

01:00:10.358 --> 01:00:13.486
Look, this thing works pretty fast,
doesn't it?

01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:16.322
I think I better go lie down over there.

01:00:18.199 --> 01:00:20.285
Walt, that'll help you.

01:00:22.954 --> 01:00:28.835
<i>Through early morning fog I see</i>

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:33.923
<i>Visions of the things to be</i>

01:00:34.215 --> 01:00:39.595
<i>The pains that are withheld for me</i>

01:00:39.846 --> 01:00:45.184
<i>I realize and I can see</i>

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:53.651
<i>That suicide is painless</i>

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:58.114
<i>It brings on many changes</i>

01:00:58.323 --> 01:01:04.954
<i>And I can take or leave it if I please</i>

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.919
<i>The game of life is hard to play</i>

01:01:12.003 --> 01:01:15.923
<i>I'm going to lose it anyway</i>

01:01:16.382 --> 01:01:20.345
<i>The losing card I'll someday lay</i>

01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:25.266
<i>So this is all I have to say</i>

01:01:27.643 --> 01:01:29.020
<i>That suicide is painless</i>

01:01:29.103 --> 01:01:32.690
Wherever you go, take this. Good luck.

01:01:32.774 --> 01:01:35.651
<i>It brings on many changes</i>

01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:39.238
<i>And I can take or leave it if I please</i>

01:01:39.322 --> 01:01:42.116
I'll always remember you just like this.

01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:48.247
<i>The only way to win is cheat</i>

01:01:48.331 --> 01:01:52.585
<i>And lay it down before I'm beat</i>

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.090
<i>And to another give my seat</i>

01:01:57.173 --> 01:02:01.886
<i>For that's the only painless feat</i>

01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:03.262
Painless.

01:02:04.639 --> 01:02:08.017
<i>Suicide is painless</i>

01:02:08.434 --> 01:02:10.144
<i>It brings on many changes</i>

01:02:10.228 --> 01:02:12.563
It was really nice of you.
Thanks for asking me.

01:02:12.647 --> 01:02:15.233
<i>And I can take or leave it if I please</i>

01:02:15.316 --> 01:02:16.526
Thing is,

01:02:17.944 --> 01:02:20.780
you're throwing
your whole education away.

01:02:23.616 --> 01:02:24.742
<i>And you can do</i>

01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:26.911
Good night, jawbreaker.

01:02:28.037 --> 01:02:31.541
<i>The same thing</i>

01:02:31.624 --> 01:02:37.755
<i>If you please</i>

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:01.279
Hi, baby.

01:03:02.238 --> 01:03:04.449
- Hi.
- I'm glad you could come.

01:03:05.283 --> 01:03:07.160
Sorry it was so late.

01:03:07.243 --> 01:03:10.872
That's okay. I really couldn't sleep anyway.
I'm so nervous.

01:03:18.254 --> 01:03:20.173
You leaving tomorrow?

01:03:22.884 --> 01:03:25.970
Yeah. I'll be on my way
in less than 12 hours.

01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:31.934
I suppose who it's going to be really
roughest on, though, is your husband.

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:36.898
Why are you all of a sudden
so concerned with him?

01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:40.318
I mean, a man would be
more considerate to his wife.

01:03:40.401 --> 01:03:42.445
He wouldn't go home a nervous wreck.

01:03:43.112 --> 01:03:46.491
You're just going to have to stop using
logic 'cause you're just proving…

01:03:46.574 --> 01:03:48.159
It could be a purely impersonal thing.

01:03:48.242 --> 01:03:50.870
… why I shouldn't go to bed with you.

01:03:51.746 --> 01:03:53.372
I didn't mean me.

01:03:57.210 --> 01:04:00.171
<i>You have the rare privilege that happens
on certain occasions</i>

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:03.299
<i>to chief executives of states or nations.</i>

01:04:03.758 --> 01:04:07.678
<i>You have the privilege
of restoring a human being's life</i>

01:04:07.762 --> 01:04:09.764
<i>by a tender act of mercy.</i>

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:14.519
What is this? Hawkeye, is he dead?

01:04:15.728 --> 01:04:17.522
No, no.

01:04:18.147 --> 01:04:20.358
He's not dead. Not yet.

01:04:21.484 --> 01:04:23.778
Painless has a grave
psychological problem,

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:26.197
and you're the only person
who can help him.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.659
Oh, no, Hawkeye. Oh, no. Come on.

01:04:29.742 --> 01:04:31.822
No, Maria.
No, you've got to look on this as a nurse.

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:35.206
Painless needs it for therapeutic value.

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:38.543
It will help him, and it certainly
wouldn't do you any harm, either,

01:04:38.626 --> 01:04:39.794
to think about it for a bit.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:41.963
If you think that your virtue
is more important

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:44.406
than Painless' life, that's fine.
That's entirely up to you.

01:04:44.465 --> 01:04:49.136
I just want you to stay here
and be with him for a minute.

01:04:49.262 --> 01:04:51.430
Just look at him.

01:04:51.514 --> 01:04:56.018
- Just stay close to the whole man.
- Oh, Hawkeye!

01:04:57.687 --> 01:04:59.313
And look at him.

01:05:04.485 --> 01:05:05.736
Hawkeye!

01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:10.616
This is ridiculous.

01:05:47.695 --> 01:05:51.824
You forgot your hat! You wouldn't
want to leave without a souvenir.

01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:53.534
Have a good trip.

01:05:55.328 --> 01:05:58.706
Lieutenant Schneider, you forgot to pick up
your traveling orders. Wait a second!

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:03.002
You're supposed to pick…
These are your traveling orders.

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:10.134
- Morning, Painless.
- Hi, Hawkeye.

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:12.553
How's she going?

01:06:12.845 --> 01:06:15.014
Slept like a doll last night.

01:06:15.097 --> 01:06:16.432
Well, can't waste time. Big day.

01:06:16.515 --> 01:06:19.143
Got two jaws to rebuild.
Come on, Seidman.

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:22.897
Have a good day.

01:06:46.295 --> 01:06:48.005
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

01:06:48.089 --> 01:06:50.800
<i>Religious services for Yom Kippur
will be held this…</i>

01:06:50.883 --> 01:06:55.012
<i>Will not, will not be held this Friday
due to mitigating circumstances.</i>

01:06:55.096 --> 01:06:57.264
<i>For those who wish to observe
said holiday,</i>

01:06:57.348 --> 01:07:00.142
<i>Sunday has been reserved. That is all.</i>

01:07:00.226 --> 01:07:02.853
- Trapper, this one's for you, babe.
- Knife.

01:07:04.313 --> 01:07:05.981
That man is a prisoner of war, Doctor.

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:08.734
So are you, sweetheart,
but you don't know it.

01:07:08.818 --> 01:07:12.029
- It's in pretty deep.
- I think that was my finger.

01:07:12.905 --> 01:07:16.033
Now, I need your help, Hawkeye.
It's hit more than a lung.

01:07:16.117 --> 01:07:18.619
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:20.871
- Hey, Radar.
- Yes.

01:07:20.955 --> 01:07:24.333
Radar, has that A negative come in from
Seoul yet? I need some in right away.

01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:27.878
- We keep ordering it, but it never arrives.
- How'd the kid take the induction, Ugly?

01:07:27.962 --> 01:07:29.755
Good. He's ready.

01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:32.133
Pickups and irrigation, please.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.468
- We good?
- Yeah.

01:07:34.552 --> 01:07:35.970
All right, give me some gel foam.

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:39.473
Not now, honey. Go back to sleep.

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:49.483
Scissors.

01:07:50.484 --> 01:07:52.403
- Sponge.
- More sponges.

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:56.699
- Let's have the suction up here. Thank you.
- Rib spreader.

01:07:57.616 --> 01:08:01.829
- Clamp.
- Let's give him a sexy scar, huh? Fantastic.

01:08:02.163 --> 01:08:03.164
There's a lot of blood.

01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:04.290
- Sponge.
- Go ahead.

01:08:04.373 --> 01:08:07.418
- Scissors. Watch it.
- Give me something to stuff it in with.

01:08:07.501 --> 01:08:08.919
- Clamp.
- Pickups to me, please.

01:08:09.003 --> 01:08:10.504
How's he tolerating this, Ugly John?

01:08:10.588 --> 01:08:13.340
- Good. He's young.
- Things get slippery in there, man.

01:08:13.424 --> 01:08:14.842
You're a backhanded guy.

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:17.178
Let me have the forceps
and a sponge stick.

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:20.930
Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass,
but you're a damn good nurse.

01:08:21.015 --> 01:08:24.350
- Thanks, Trapper.
- Put in the blood there, will you, John?

01:08:24.435 --> 01:08:26.580
There's a clot on the cava,
just above the atrium, though.

01:08:26.604 --> 01:08:27.938
Must be the point of entry.

01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:29.189
Clamp.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.613
I feel a fragment right underneath the clot.

01:08:35.696 --> 01:08:37.782
- You control the cava.
- Okay.

01:08:37.865 --> 01:08:40.618
- We got to stop that spurting.
- Clamp.

01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:42.828
- Do what?
- Stop the spurting.

01:08:42.912 --> 01:08:45.413
That's a very good technical term.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:47.957
Oh, Christ. It's not in the cava.

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:50.085
It's in the pulmonary artery
in the left side.

01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:53.064
Okay, let me close him up, sit on it
for a couple of days till we get the blood.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.192
We can't sit on it for a couple of days.
What if we get jammed up?

01:08:55.216 --> 01:08:57.009
We don't have the blood!

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:59.412
We got to turn him over.
If you cut again, you'll lose him.

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:03.515
Look, Hawkeye, the artery can erode.
I would…

01:09:03.599 --> 01:09:05.975
Now's the time to take our shot.
We got to shoot crap.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:09.060
- A negative. It's been cross-matched.
- You said you didn't have any blood.

01:09:09.104 --> 01:09:10.272
I found a donor.

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:15.319
You know, up close, all crumpled up like
that, they don't look like much, you know.

01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:17.904
Hey, was he loaded or empty
when he crashed?

01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:20.825
No, he was loaded,
but it didn't matter much.

01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:24.286
You see, the two guys
he was carrying were dead already.

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:26.205
What about the pilot?
What happened to him?

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.499
Pilot's fine. Took off a kneecap,

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:30.852
and he lost the function
in his right hand, but he's great.

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:34.421
I didn't hear. What color was her hair?

01:09:34.505 --> 01:09:37.174
Black, shiny. Shiny, black hair.

01:09:37.258 --> 01:09:42.720
Black? You like black?
I'm kind of partial to blonde myself.

01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:47.643
I knew it. I knew you had
an attraction for Hot Lips Houlihan.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:49.937
- Hear! Hear!
- Go to hell, Captain Pierce.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.523
You know I damn near puke
every time I look at her.

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:55.484
Besides, I'll bet she's not a real blonde.

01:09:55.568 --> 01:10:00.614
How dare you say that about
an officer of the United States Army, sir?

01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:04.994
I'll not only say it,
but I'll back it with 20 bucks. How's that?

01:10:05.077 --> 01:10:07.955
You have yourself a bet, sir.
You're my witness.

01:10:08.038 --> 01:10:10.851
I'll be a witness, but who's going to be
the poor <i>schmuck</i> who finds out?

01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:15.462
Well, I could, if no one else wants, I…

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:20.676
No, no. We got to all see it together
somehow.

01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:37.878
You know, it's five minutes after the time
the nurses usually take their shower.

01:10:37.902 --> 01:10:40.154
- Where are they?
- They will be here.

01:10:41.655 --> 01:10:43.449
Finest kind, Ho-Jon.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.827
- What's happening?
- Radar.

01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:49.163
- You see the papers?
- What?

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:50.682
- You don't know about the papers?
- What papers?

01:10:50.706 --> 01:10:51.850
The Colonel left some papers.

01:10:51.874 --> 01:10:55.336
- Why didn't you tell me about the papers?
- I tried to tell you.

01:10:57.838 --> 01:11:00.925
Here you go, here you go. They're coming.

01:11:09.433 --> 01:11:11.894
- Evelyn, could you give me a hand?
- Sure.

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:15.522
Hey, Frankie, could you take a look
at my corns, please?

01:11:16.565 --> 01:11:18.651
Knocko, the pictures of my kids
have come.

01:11:18.734 --> 01:11:20.277
The pictures of my kids have come.

01:11:20.361 --> 01:11:22.380
Hot Lips, would you like to see
the pictures of my kids?

01:11:22.404 --> 01:11:24.573
I'm not the slightest bit interested.

01:12:43.152 --> 01:12:44.528
Bravo!

01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:47.948
Bravo! Bravo!

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.326
Bravo! Author! Bravo!

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:57.332
Bravo! Author! Author!

01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:59.001
20 bucks, huh?

01:12:59.668 --> 01:13:01.378
You win the bet.

01:13:01.462 --> 01:13:03.505
You bastards!

01:13:15.017 --> 01:13:17.120
- Major, what went on over there…
- Where's Colonel Blake?

01:13:17.144 --> 01:13:18.580
Wait a second.
You can't go and see Colonel Blake.

01:13:18.604 --> 01:13:20.647
You shut up, you twerp!

01:13:28.072 --> 01:13:31.575
This isn't a hospital!
It's an insane asylum!

01:13:31.658 --> 01:13:36.246
And it's your fault because you don't
do anything to discourage them!

01:13:36.872 --> 01:13:40.042
- What do you want me to do?
- Put them under arrest!

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:44.171
See what a court-martial thinks
of their drunken hooliganism!

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:49.843
At first they called me Hot Lips,
and you let them get away with it,

01:13:49.927 --> 01:13:53.764
and then you let them
get away with everything!

01:13:55.349 --> 01:14:00.854
If you don't turn them over
to the MP this minute,

01:14:00.938 --> 01:14:06.110
I'm going to resign my commission!

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:09.905
God damn it, Hot Lips,
resign your goddamn commission.

01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:16.495
My commission!

01:14:17.538 --> 01:14:19.248
My commission!

01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:21.875
My commission!

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:24.545
A little more wine, my dear?

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:26.213
Yes, please.

01:14:35.055 --> 01:14:36.974
Don't forget to get your mother
her present.

01:14:37.057 --> 01:14:39.560
You know what I want to get her?

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:41.145
Come on, baby.

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:46.400
Come on. You all right?
Keep it straight, eh?

01:14:46.483 --> 01:14:49.194
No. First of all, the present,
then dinner, then the movie.

01:14:49.278 --> 01:14:51.118
- You mean all, all three of us?
- Who is this?

01:14:51.196 --> 01:14:52.865
Where I go, Warren goes.

01:14:52.948 --> 01:14:54.908
What? You don't want me to go with you?

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:58.453
- It's not that.
- I think…

01:14:59.246 --> 01:15:01.081
Oh, yes, I do!

01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:05.502
He's Syngman Rhee's son,
and he goes right in.

01:15:07.921 --> 01:15:09.506
Come on, Bandini.

01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:18.682
Hey, soldier!

01:15:21.268 --> 01:15:24.771
- Me?
- Yeah, you. Where you from?

01:15:24.855 --> 01:15:28.692
- A MASH outfit at the frontline.
- No, I mean your hometown.

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:30.861
It's on the East Coast.

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:33.030
Have you been wounded yet?

01:15:35.782 --> 01:15:38.118
Yeah, a little, a slight…

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:40.829
Would you like to say hello
to your mother?

01:15:40.913 --> 01:15:43.498
Well, my mother's dead, actually.
She's deceased.

01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:46.084
Well, I'm sorry.

01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:50.380
- I'd like to say hello to my father, if I could.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine, fine.

01:15:52.132 --> 01:15:53.383
Hi, Dad.

01:16:19.201 --> 01:16:23.497
Excuse me. I am making an examination
of this young man

01:16:24.331 --> 01:16:26.917
to find out if he would be
a soldier in our army.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.629
Oh, yeah, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon.
How's she going, boy?

01:16:30.712 --> 01:16:33.173
His heartbeat is much too fast,

01:16:33.257 --> 01:16:37.052
and his blood pressure
is dangerously high.

01:16:37.135 --> 01:16:38.387
Oh, yeah?

01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:42.975
I guess you probably think
he's unfit for the army, eh?

01:16:43.058 --> 01:16:48.355
Yes, at first. But when I saw on his paper
he worked in an American hospital

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:52.526
where there are many drugs,
and he could have taken some by mistake.

01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:55.737
- What would he do a thing like that for?
- Who knows?

01:16:55.821 --> 01:16:59.283
To find the truth, I will keep him here
with me for a couple of days.

01:16:59.366 --> 01:17:02.703
By tomorrow, his fast heart
and high blood pressure may be gone.

01:17:02.786 --> 01:17:06.123
- Look…
- So I suggest you say goodbye to him now.

01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:08.667
- Doctor, I've…
- It was a nice try. It was a nice try.

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:10.127
Come on, Ho-Jon.

01:17:14.881 --> 01:17:17.175
Oh, man!

01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:22.014
<i>The following program is brought to you

Hey!

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:10.354
Idiot! He knocked me down the hill!
He broke my umbrella!

01:18:13.106 --> 01:18:16.985
I wish they wouldn't land these things here
when we're playing golf.

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:21.531
- That's him on the right.
- Fore!

01:18:21.615 --> 01:18:23.533
- Wait! Wait!
- Captain…

01:18:23.617 --> 01:18:26.370
The lieutenant's come all the way
from Seoul, sir, just to see you.

01:18:26.453 --> 01:18:29.039
- You're Captain McIntyre?
- Yes, I'm Captain…

01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:31.541
Lieutenant, you look terrible.

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:34.044
Captain, look at his eyes.
Let me see your tongue.

01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:37.714
Oh, no, no. Here, take your shirt off
and tell me where it hurts.

01:18:37.798 --> 01:18:41.593
I haven't seen a case like this
since I was in school. Oh, my goodness.

01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:44.679
Listen, Vollmer, tell them
to prepare the major surgery.

01:18:44.763 --> 01:18:47.224
This is one case in five.
I think I can save you, Lieutenant.

01:18:47.307 --> 01:18:49.976
You're to proceed to
Kokura, Japan immediately.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.396
Kokura, Japan! What's this all about?

01:18:52.479 --> 01:18:54.147
Yeah. His dad's a Congressman.

01:18:54.648 --> 01:18:56.876
Grenade went off in practice.
There's a piece in his heart.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.444
- What?
- GI's dad's a Congressman.

01:18:59.528 --> 01:19:01.988
Grenade went off in practice.
Piece in his heart.

01:19:02.072 --> 01:19:04.616
- That the x-rays?
- Yeah.

01:19:05.075 --> 01:19:09.121
Apparently some big heart surgeon
in Boston told the Congressman

01:19:09.204 --> 01:19:14.126
the only man to take care of his son
is Captain John McIntyre.

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:19.673
Of course, I suppose there could be
two Captain John McIntyres.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:22.092
No, no, I'm the only John McIntyre.

01:19:22.175 --> 01:19:25.178
Look, Hammond says I can take along
someone to assist me if I need him.

01:19:25.262 --> 01:19:26.680
- You want to come?
- Yeah.

01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:31.977
Lieutenant, I think I can save you.
Look, take one of these every half-hour.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.872
Now, get into your helicopter and button
up your shirt, for crying out loud!

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:37.524
You're in the military army!

01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:40.694
- That piece isn't even close to his heart.
- I know, I know. It's nothing.

01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:43.989
But, look, how many times do you
get to go to Japan with your golf clubs?

01:19:44.072 --> 01:19:45.365
Come on, Shirley.

01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:18.940
Goddamn army.

01:20:28.867 --> 01:20:30.327
Goddamn army.

01:20:38.627 --> 01:20:40.587
Goddamn army jeep.

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.343
Excuse me, soldier.

01:20:46.426 --> 01:20:48.321
I wonder if you could tell me
where the Congressman's son is?

01:20:48.345 --> 01:20:50.764
- He's in Ward 6.
- Darling, would you register for us?

01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:52.516
- Just a moment!
- Ward 6.

01:20:52.599 --> 01:20:55.519
You can't go in there. Who are you?

01:20:55.602 --> 01:20:57.270
Who am I? I am the pro from Dover,

01:20:57.354 --> 01:20:58.789
- and this is my favorite caddy.
- I don't believe you.

01:20:58.813 --> 01:21:00.583
You can't go in till I call Captain Peterson.

01:21:00.607 --> 01:21:02.585
- We already called Captain Peterson.
- Wait a second.

01:21:02.609 --> 01:21:03.961
If this soldier wants to enforce
her own orders,

01:21:03.985 --> 01:21:06.821
I'm going to take her on single-handedly.

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:09.407
- Get away!
- You open this.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:11.952
- He's won two Purple Hearts.
- You can't…

01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:14.680
- I'll ravage your body, lady.
- You stay away from me. I'll call the police.

01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:17.642
- You can't come in here! You can't.
- You have not seen such a beast, lady.

01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:20.794
I'm going to call Captain Peterson.
You stay away from me!

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.551
Captain Peterson, please.

01:21:27.634 --> 01:21:29.302
Captain Peterson!

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.060
What are you two hoodlums
doing in this hospital?

01:21:36.101 --> 01:21:38.186
Ma'am, we are surgeons
and we're here to operate.

01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:39.789
We're just waiting for a starting time,
that's all.

01:21:39.813 --> 01:21:41.333
Well, you can't even go near a patient

01:21:41.398 --> 01:21:44.234
until Colonel Merrill says it's okay,
and he's still out to lunch.

01:21:44.317 --> 01:21:46.236
Look, Mother, I want to go to work
in one hour.

01:21:46.319 --> 01:21:49.906
We are the pros from Dover,
and we figure to crack this kid's chest

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:52.075
and get out to the golf course
before it gets dark.

01:21:52.158 --> 01:21:53.577
So you go find the gas passer,

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.412
and you have him
pre-medicate this patient,

01:21:55.495 --> 01:21:57.014
then bring me the latest pictures on him.

01:21:57.038 --> 01:21:59.416
The ones we saw
must be 48 hours old by now.

01:21:59.499 --> 01:22:02.043
Then call the kitchen
and have them rustle us up some lunch.

01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:03.980
Ham and eggs will be all right.
Steak would be even better.

01:22:04.004 --> 01:22:07.007
And then give me at least one nurse
who knows how to work in close

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:08.842
without getting her tits in my way.

01:22:10.385 --> 01:22:12.012
Oh, you fool.

01:22:14.598 --> 01:22:17.309
How do you want your steak cooked?

01:22:22.188 --> 01:22:23.398
Towel.

01:22:29.362 --> 01:22:32.449
Say the magic words, you make $100.

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:39.122
All right! I demand an explanation.

01:22:39.205 --> 01:22:41.645
Somebody get that dirty old man
out of this operating theater.

01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:43.335
Dirty old man…

01:22:44.044 --> 01:22:45.420
I'm Colonel Merrill.

01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:49.007
I don't care if you're Jack Armstrong,
the All-American Boy.

01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:53.178
If this chest gets infected,
I will tell the Congressman who did it.

01:22:53.261 --> 01:22:56.264
- Scissors, please.
- Will you let me have a skin suture?

01:22:56.348 --> 01:22:57.724
Load pickups.

01:22:59.225 --> 01:23:01.686
- Who was that?
- That's Colonel Merrill.

01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:04.564
- This is his little store here.
- Oh, yeah?

01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:06.816
Who are you?

01:23:07.233 --> 01:23:10.904
I'm Dr. Jekyll, actually.
This is my friend, Mr. Hyde.

01:23:13.073 --> 01:23:15.283
Then why don't you save
your rapier-like wit

01:23:15.367 --> 01:23:18.119
for the clam diggers back home, Hawkeye?

01:23:20.872 --> 01:23:22.415
Approximate her.

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:26.920
Did I ever tell you about my friend,
"Me Lai" Marston?

01:23:27.295 --> 01:23:28.380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:23:28.463 --> 01:23:29.857
That friend of yours
who would go around saying,

01:23:29.881 --> 01:23:33.843
"Me lay, you lay" to all the girls,
and, what, he'd score once out of 50 times.

01:23:33.927 --> 01:23:35.595
Yeah, you told me about him.

01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:38.848
He's passing gas
for the Congressman's son here.

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:42.018
Really? When he's not passing gas,
does he play golf?

01:23:42.102 --> 01:23:43.603
I don't know.

01:23:43.937 --> 01:23:46.856
- Do you play golf?
- No. I have no time for golf.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:51.194
I'm moonlighting down at Dr. Yamachi's
New Era Hospital and Whorehouse.

01:23:51.611 --> 01:23:53.255
This old guy that I met
when I first came over here,

01:23:53.279 --> 01:23:55.240
he's got a little crude hospital for kids

01:23:55.323 --> 01:23:58.243
and he finances it with a whorehouse,
all in the same building.

01:23:58.618 --> 01:24:02.330
It's the NEHWH. Come on down,
and we'll get something going for you.

01:24:02.414 --> 01:24:05.583
- I've got an in, in Kokura!
- Here, soldier, take these,

01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:07.460
and take our golf carts, and… Be careful.

01:24:07.544 --> 01:24:09.855
Don't drop any of those things
'cause we're going to play golf later.

01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:11.381
- It's important.
- Goodbye, pimp.

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:14.259
- Ladies.
- Girls.

01:24:14.342 --> 01:24:16.803
Gentlemen. Be careful with that…

01:24:17.762 --> 01:24:19.472
Military police.

01:24:37.907 --> 01:24:41.327
All right, fellas, the game's over.

01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:45.665
Finally caught up with us, huh?

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.169
Where did we fail?

01:24:49.252 --> 01:24:51.212
I don't know. I think it was the woman.

01:24:51.337 --> 01:24:54.174
Something tells me
I've seen her some place before.

01:24:54.883 --> 01:24:57.010
She was the one in Tangiers.

01:24:57.886 --> 01:25:02.182
You can wait in the colonel's office.
He'll be back in a few minutes.

01:25:12.275 --> 01:25:14.027
We don't blame you.

01:25:17.405 --> 01:25:18.865
You're only doing your job.

01:25:19.032 --> 01:25:23.203
<i>United Press International, today,
voted the Korean War</i>

01:25:23.286 --> 01:25:27.290
<i>- the top news story of 1951.</i>
- We're in the middle of putting.

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:29.334
My God.

01:25:31.377 --> 01:25:33.922
All right. You men are under arrest.

01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:38.051
- I'll have you court-martialed.
- Come off it, Colonel.

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:40.720
You won't have us. We have you.

01:25:40.804 --> 01:25:45.225
Your boys blew this case
and we bailed you out.

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:48.603
Now we are going to stay here
for one more day

01:25:48.686 --> 01:25:51.481
and check out the Congressman's kid

01:25:51.564 --> 01:25:55.276
and get in some golf for ourselves.

01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:58.988
If that's okay with you, then we got a deal.

01:25:59.489 --> 01:26:02.158
And if it isn't,
then we can always call Washington

01:26:02.242 --> 01:26:04.953
and you tell them your story
and we'll tell them ours.

01:26:05.036 --> 01:26:06.329
It's as simple as that.

01:26:06.412 --> 01:26:08.998
In the meantime,
we are going to be at the pro shop,

01:26:09.082 --> 01:26:11.376
where we are going to have
a shower and a shave.

01:26:11.459 --> 01:26:15.338
If you want to get in touch with us,
that is where we will be.

01:26:20.635 --> 01:26:22.971
Is that a client? Excuse me.

01:26:32.063 --> 01:26:34.774
- I've got sinus, too.
- Put some of that in that one.

01:26:34.858 --> 01:26:36.901
- Put it in a plate.
- How about sake?

01:26:40.113 --> 01:26:41.447
Excuse me.

01:26:43.032 --> 01:26:45.118
That really looks terrible.

01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:51.165
- Okay.
- You try one.

01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:54.627
- Good?
- It's terrible.

01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:03.344
Listen, I hate to do this to you, fellas,

01:27:03.428 --> 01:27:06.306
but do you think you could take a minute
and look at a kid for me?

01:27:06.389 --> 01:27:07.891
- Now?
- A kid?

01:27:07.974 --> 01:27:09.785
Yeah.
We had a little carelessness around here,

01:27:09.809 --> 01:27:11.936
and the other day,
one of our girls presented us

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.814
with an eight pound
American-Japanese boy.

01:27:17.483 --> 01:27:19.523
Whatever we feed him,
it either comes right back up,

01:27:19.569 --> 01:27:22.697
or he coughs and he turns blue.
He just has a hell of a time.

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.301
We don't have to see him.
Just call that half-assed army hospital

01:27:25.325 --> 01:27:27.619
and tell them to get some Lipiodol
ready for his stomach,

01:27:27.702 --> 01:27:29.287
and we'll go over and take some x-rays.

01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:31.247
We can't get near that place.

01:27:31.331 --> 01:27:34.083
You know, with a civilian,
the colonel has a big thing about it,

01:27:34.167 --> 01:27:35.728
especially a native,
as he likes to call them.

01:27:35.752 --> 01:27:37.271
Then don't tell him
any more than necessary.

01:27:37.295 --> 01:27:39.881
Tell him the pros from Dover
are on their way with an emergency.

01:27:39.964 --> 01:27:42.425
Tell him to get the OR ready,
get the kid asleep

01:27:42.508 --> 01:27:45.678
and Trapper and I'll fix
his tracheoesophageal fistula.

01:27:48.389 --> 01:27:50.934
Okay, Me Lai, put him down in here.

01:27:51.017 --> 01:27:53.603
Get him to sleep
as quick as you can, will you?

01:27:53.686 --> 01:27:56.105
- Where did this baby come from?
- Watch him.

01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:58.626
- Is this what you got us up for?
- Yeah. That's what we got you up for.

01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:00.085
Now, come on. Look, we stumbled on him.

01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:02.946
We don't want him, but we don't feel
we can back away from him.

01:28:03.029 --> 01:28:05.448
All right.
This time, I will not be intimidated.

01:28:05.531 --> 01:28:07.251
I command that this
illegal and improper use

01:28:07.325 --> 01:28:09.494
of army facilities cease immediately!

01:28:09.577 --> 01:28:12.664
On this point, I stand as firm
as the Rock of Gibraltar.

01:28:12.747 --> 01:28:14.624
And furthermore… You can't do…

01:28:21.839 --> 01:28:23.466
This one is for West Point.

01:28:23.549 --> 01:28:25.885
What the Sam Hill's going on here?

01:28:25.969 --> 01:28:30.056
That's what they all say.
What a filthy, disgusting, despicable…

01:28:31.432 --> 01:28:35.144
There's no competition to the Painless
Pole, but it's pretty healthy, I think.

01:28:35.228 --> 01:28:37.689
You know, Colonel,
we caught you with your pants down.

01:28:37.772 --> 01:28:40.858
- The men that are fighting…
- The men are fighting on our frontline!

01:28:42.652 --> 01:28:44.445
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

01:28:44.737 --> 01:28:48.408

- Could I have some longer needles?
- Get this sponge out of the way.

01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:29.449
Cut down on the back, will you?
Hey, Dago.

01:29:29.782 --> 01:29:34.620
- Hi. Did you have a nice time in Japan?
- Yeah, I screwed a kabuki dancer.

01:29:37.248 --> 01:29:39.542
- Let me have the long-fingers.
- It's okay for a while.

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:42.336
- Yeah, but I can't stop this bleeding.
- Okay.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.172
Keeping the blood internal.

01:29:44.255 --> 01:29:47.300
- How's the intake, Painless?
- Normal.

01:29:47.383 --> 01:29:48.551
Clamps down there.

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:52.930
- I'm here if you need me, Henry.
- I can't talk to you now, <i>padre.</i>

01:29:53.014 --> 01:29:55.892
No, I mean, he's going to be all right,
isn't he?

01:29:55.975 --> 01:29:58.561
- He's going to be fine.
- Good.

01:29:58.644 --> 01:30:00.855
Does anybody else need help?

01:30:02.607 --> 01:30:03.649
Ask around.

01:30:09.113 --> 01:30:11.491
What's he got the flaps down for?

01:30:15.703 --> 01:30:19.415
- Duke. Come on, Duke. Open up.
- What? No, I don't want any.

01:30:19.499 --> 01:30:21.751
Hey, Duke. Come on. Open up, man.

01:30:21.834 --> 01:30:23.336
Who is it?

01:30:29.008 --> 01:30:30.368
What the hell you doing back here?

01:30:30.426 --> 01:30:32.845
Come on. We've been working for hours.
Will you open up?

01:30:32.929 --> 01:30:35.556
Wait a minute. I'll be right with you.

01:30:45.483 --> 01:30:47.693
- Hi, Hot Lips.
- You miss us?

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.074
<i>- Shame, shame on you
- Shame, shame on you</i>

01:30:56.035 --> 01:30:57.036
Well…

01:31:01.374 --> 01:31:03.000
- Radar.
- Yes, sir.

01:31:04.794 --> 01:31:06.462
Hold this, please.

01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:12.008
Colonel Blake.

01:31:12.051 --> 01:31:14.679
Henry? Yeah. Charlie here. Yeah.

01:31:14.762 --> 01:31:16.556
I've got news for you.

01:31:16.639 --> 01:31:19.433
You were so concerned
about the battle for Old Baldy.

01:31:19.809 --> 01:31:23.729
<i>- Well, it's all over.</i>
- That's great news, General. Who won?

01:31:24.188 --> 01:31:30.570
By the way, I have a report here, Henry,
from your chief nurse Major O'Houlihan.

01:31:31.112 --> 01:31:35.158
<i>She makes some accusations, Henry,
I find pretty hard to believe.</i>

01:31:35.241 --> 01:31:38.119
Don't believe them, then.
Thank you, General. Goodbye.

01:31:38.202 --> 01:31:39.453
Yeah… What?

01:31:39.912 --> 01:31:42.582
- Thank you, Radar.
- You're welcome, sir.

01:31:44.876 --> 01:31:50.173
<i>Attention. Attention. Friday night's movie
will be</i> The Glory Brigade.

01:31:50.256 --> 01:31:53.050
<i>Rock 'em, sock 'em, kisses you never got.</i>

01:31:53.593 --> 01:31:58.306
<i>It's Uncle Sam's combat engineers

01:32:02.935 --> 01:32:05.688

<i>Starring Victor Mature. That is all.</i>

01:32:09.192 --> 01:32:10.776
I'll be with Colonel Blake.

01:32:11.611 --> 01:32:14.071
Check this place out.
See what the nurses are like, huh?

01:32:14.155 --> 01:32:15.615
Right, sir.

01:32:17.033 --> 01:32:19.911
- 4077th Mobile Army Surgical…
- Yeah, yeah.

01:32:19.994 --> 01:32:22.788
- Sir, do you know where…
- Yes, I know where he is.

01:32:22.872 --> 01:32:24.332
All right.

01:32:24.415 --> 01:32:25.750
All right.

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:29.420
- Thank you.
- Look, Charlie,

01:32:29.962 --> 01:32:31.255
you can't blame Henry

01:32:31.339 --> 01:32:34.550
because Hot Lips Houlihan
can't stand her name.

01:32:34.967 --> 01:32:37.553
You know, she's just a lady, though.
What the hell?

01:32:37.637 --> 01:32:39.639
Come on, for crying out loud.

01:32:39.722 --> 01:32:42.225
She's regular army.
She's a fanatic about ritual.

01:32:42.308 --> 01:32:44.936
She won't even let us play football.

01:32:45.019 --> 01:32:48.105
- Football?
- Gentlemen. She's all lined up, Charlie.

01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:51.275
Yeah. I didn't know
you had a football team.

01:32:51.359 --> 01:32:53.861
It's pretty much in the planning stage.

01:32:53.945 --> 01:32:56.239
No, no, we have a very fine football team.

01:32:56.322 --> 01:33:00.952
Yeah? Well, we had a team
back with the 325th Evac last year.

01:33:01.035 --> 01:33:04.789
- And what a team that was.
- Yeah. I coached the boys myself.

01:33:05.915 --> 01:33:08.834
- He's the finest coach in the Far East.
- Yeah.

01:33:08.918 --> 01:33:11.254
We're now trying to work out
a schedule of the outfits

01:33:11.337 --> 01:33:12.964
that we're going to play this year.

01:33:13.047 --> 01:33:17.426
Of course, we, you know, throw
a little money into a pot and make bets.

01:33:17.843 --> 01:33:21.264
How much money
do you put into your pot?

01:33:21.347 --> 01:33:24.850
- $5,000, $6,000.
- $5,000!

01:33:25.393 --> 01:33:28.604
Look, you know, I don't think we're
in the sort of league that you're in.

01:33:28.688 --> 01:33:32.400
Well, I'm sure we can find a date
when we can play your team.

01:33:32.483 --> 01:33:36.612
- It can be arranged.
- Yeah. I think I'll talk this over with Henry.

01:33:36.696 --> 01:33:38.698
Thanks, boys. Thanks for the drink.

01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:41.659
- Thank you.
- What the hell you…

01:33:41.742 --> 01:33:45.079
Sir, ever since the dark days
before Pearl Harbor,

01:33:45.162 --> 01:33:46.872
I've been proud to wear this uniform.

01:33:46.956 --> 01:33:48.916
- What the hell is this?
- A helicopter.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.295
Hawkeye, that man has five times
the manpower to draw on than we do.

01:33:52.378 --> 01:33:55.506
Sure, so we get ourselves a ringer, right?

01:33:55.589 --> 01:34:00.428
We get Henry to apply, make a specific
application for a neurosurgeon.

01:34:00.511 --> 01:34:04.098
He asks for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.

01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:08.811
- Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones?
- He's… Who is Oliver Harmon Jones?

01:34:08.894 --> 01:34:12.398
He is better known as Spearchucker Jones.

01:34:13.524 --> 01:34:15.151
- He's a good ballplayer.
- Yes!

01:34:15.234 --> 01:34:17.695
He's a negro boy,
played with the 49ers, didn't he?

01:34:17.778 --> 01:34:18.964
- Sure.
- Yeah. Sure, I remember.

01:34:18.988 --> 01:34:20.031
He's good. He's good.

01:34:20.406 --> 01:34:22.658
Henry, if we had closer relations,

01:34:22.742 --> 01:34:25.661
we wouldn't have
this misunderstanding, right?

01:34:25.745 --> 01:34:30.124
Now, that's where a football game
would help between your outfit and mine.

01:34:30.207 --> 01:34:31.226
- A football game?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:35.254
We put up a few bets,
$5,000 maybe, and have a little fun.

01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:39.008
Special Services in Tokyo says
it's one of the best gimmicks we've got

01:34:39.091 --> 01:34:41.677
to keep the American way of life
going here in Asia.

01:34:41.761 --> 01:34:44.096
- Betting?
- No. Football.

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.349
But what about Major O'Houlihan?

01:34:46.432 --> 01:34:49.101
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.

01:34:49.185 --> 01:34:50.579
- Gee, I don't know…
- It's a helicopter, General.

01:34:50.603 --> 01:34:52.813
I know it's a helicopter.

01:34:52.897 --> 01:34:54.899
You know what?
You guys have one problem.

01:34:54.982 --> 01:34:56.418
I just wondered about the social problem,
you know.

01:34:56.442 --> 01:35:00.446
I mean, he's the only Negro officer
in the whole camp, you know.

01:35:00.946 --> 01:35:04.658
We got a problem, then
we'll stick him in here with us, baby boy.

01:35:06.202 --> 01:35:09.455
- You're serious, ain't you? You'd do that.
- Sure, I'm serious. Yeah.

01:35:10.623 --> 01:35:13.376
It's enough for me to have to put up
with you two Yankees,

01:35:13.459 --> 01:35:15.628
but I'm, you know, that's…

01:35:18.464 --> 01:35:22.259
Because of his wife, was that why?
Or was it a religious problem?

01:35:22.343 --> 01:35:25.030
- It was a conditioning problem.
- Why do they call you Spearchucker?

01:35:25.054 --> 01:35:27.181
I used to throw the javelin.

01:35:33.813 --> 01:35:37.024
All right, men, we're not here
to sell lemonade. We're here to practice.

01:35:37.108 --> 01:35:40.027
But first I'd like to
officially welcome Spearchucker.

01:35:40.111 --> 01:35:42.297
- Is it all right to call you that?
- Call me whatever you want to.

01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:44.841
Good. Well, I just want you to know
that we're all the same here

01:35:44.865 --> 01:35:47.785
on the playing field, officers and men alike.

01:35:47.868 --> 01:35:51.580
Now, we're going to begin
with the three basic principles.

01:35:51.664 --> 01:35:54.708
Organization, discipline and teamwork.

01:35:54.792 --> 01:35:55.835
- Now…
- Pardon me.

01:35:55.918 --> 01:35:59.422
- Do you mind if we limber up first?
- That's a good idea. You organize that.

01:36:02.049 --> 01:36:06.470
Move that line, hey! Hold that line, hey!

01:36:06.554 --> 01:36:10.683
<i>All right, Seidman, keep on
pushing that… Whatever you call it.</i>

01:36:10.766 --> 01:36:14.895
<i>That's good. All right, Hot Lips,
keep their arms and limbs moving there.</i>

01:36:17.314 --> 01:36:21.402
<i>Radar, you're a coach.
You're not a corporal. You're a coach,</i>

01:36:21.485 --> 01:36:23.154
<i>so keep them going through there.</i>

01:36:23.571 --> 01:36:24.738
<i>Good, Hot Lips.</i>

01:36:25.531 --> 01:36:27.616
<i>All right, Seidman, give them five.</i>

01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.618
<i>All right, men, take five.</i>

01:36:29.702 --> 01:36:31.287
Spearchucker.

01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:38.210
Well, we look pretty lousy, don't we?

01:36:38.294 --> 01:36:40.313
Well, for college players
that have been out of training

01:36:40.337 --> 01:36:42.441
for seven or eight years,
yeah, you look pretty lousy.

01:36:42.465 --> 01:36:44.633
Listen, I got an idea
how we can make some money.

01:36:44.717 --> 01:36:46.278
We leave him out
of the first half of the game.

01:36:46.302 --> 01:36:49.805
We bet half our money.
They roll up some points, okay?

01:36:49.889 --> 01:36:52.475
Second half of the game, we stick him in.
We get odds from them.

01:36:52.558 --> 01:36:54.768
We bet the other half of the money.
We clean up.

01:36:54.852 --> 01:36:57.646
- That's very good thinking, Captain.
- Yeah. It sounds good to me.

01:36:57.730 --> 01:37:01.150
And I had another idea.
I think we should have some plays.

01:37:01.233 --> 01:37:04.069
You know, usually in football,
you have some organized plays.

01:37:04.153 --> 01:37:07.573
- Well, if you don't mind, I took the liberty.
- You have.

01:37:07.656 --> 01:37:10.326
- I drew up about seven or eight plays.
- These are good.

01:37:10.409 --> 01:37:12.249
I think that's about all
this bunch can handle.

01:37:12.328 --> 01:37:16.081
Very good. Yes. Very, very good.

01:37:17.625 --> 01:37:18.792
What are these little arrows?

01:37:56.622 --> 01:37:58.415
- Right into his hands.
- Right on!

01:38:15.266 --> 01:38:18.060
- Well, it's only six points.
- Six points.

01:38:25.818 --> 01:38:27.418
- Well, it's only one point.
- One point!

01:38:27.486 --> 01:38:29.965
Who's that number one? That man
runs like a rabbit. We can't stop him.

01:38:29.989 --> 01:38:32.050
Yeah. I remember him from the pros.
They call him Super Bug.

01:38:32.074 --> 01:38:33.635
He had one year with the Rams
before the army got him.

01:38:33.659 --> 01:38:36.763
- We can't do anything with him in there.
- Hey, listen. You got to come in now.

01:38:36.787 --> 01:38:37.931
- We can't wait till the second half.
- No, no.

01:38:37.955 --> 01:38:39.140
We got to stick to our strategy,

01:38:39.164 --> 01:38:41.643
but the first thing you guys have to do
is get him out of the ballgame.

01:38:41.667 --> 01:38:43.419
Hey, Davidson! Here.

01:38:44.044 --> 01:38:48.132
Let's ease up just a little bit.
We don't want the score too lopsided.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.181
He caught it!

01:38:58.684 --> 01:39:00.603
- Get him!
- Get him!

01:39:05.858 --> 01:39:07.192
- Go get him!
- Go get him!

01:39:09.695 --> 01:39:10.821
Who's he giving it to?

01:39:10.904 --> 01:39:14.742
- Isn't that Corporal Judson with the ball?
- Judson's a lineman. Judson can't run!

01:39:14.825 --> 01:39:16.577
He's loose. He's loose.

01:39:21.081 --> 01:39:24.293
For crying out loud, Judson,
what're you doing?

01:39:24.376 --> 01:39:26.855
- Duke, you threw me that damn ball.
- Come on, let's get in a huddle.

01:39:26.879 --> 01:39:28.631
What the hell?
You had the whole field open!

01:39:28.714 --> 01:39:30.299
Why'd you go and fall down for?

01:39:30.382 --> 01:39:32.217
I'm no goddamn runner. I'm a lineman.

01:39:35.054 --> 01:39:37.431
We're going to really clean up today.

01:39:37.514 --> 01:39:39.183
Hut one, hut two!

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.696
- It's only two points.
- Two points.

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:55.157
What the hell you think you are,
a cannon?

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.533
What kind of a snap was that?

01:39:56.617 --> 01:39:59.620
We got a lot of money on this game.
This is embarrassing, man.

01:39:59.703 --> 01:40:02.915
- Oh, go, we want some dough!
- Oh, go, we want some dough!

01:40:08.379 --> 01:40:10.214
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

01:40:12.049 --> 01:40:14.677
- What happens now?
- We get a free kick.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.179
A free kick! Girls!

01:40:17.262 --> 01:40:20.432
- Hit that ball! Kick that ball!
- Hit that ball! Kick that ball!

01:40:46.792 --> 01:40:49.920
- Another six points.
- Another six points.

01:40:53.549 --> 01:40:56.135
Look, look, he's hurt.

01:40:56.218 --> 01:40:58.220
He's leaving the game!

01:40:58.303 --> 01:41:02.057
He's hurt! He's hurt!
He's leaving the game! He's hurt!

01:41:02.141 --> 01:41:05.894
He's hurt! He's hurt!
He's leaving the game! He's hurt!

01:41:05.978 --> 01:41:08.313
What the hell's the matter with you?
Smith!

01:41:08.397 --> 01:41:12.735
- Goddamn bastards pulled something.
- Hey, Coach, did I break my 9 in 400?

01:41:12.818 --> 01:41:15.696
400! This is not a track meet.
This is a football game.

01:41:15.779 --> 01:41:17.906
What the hell do you think I pay you for?

01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:20.242
Get him up. Walk him around.
Do something.

01:41:20.325 --> 01:41:25.164
- I think I'll run the 440.
- 440! This is a football game, God damn it!

01:41:32.045 --> 01:41:34.673
All right, you guys,
get in there and kill them!

01:41:46.977 --> 01:41:49.097
All right, bub, your fucking head
is coming right off.

01:41:59.823 --> 01:42:02.201
- I'm ready, Coach. Ready, Coach.
- Ready for what?

01:42:02.284 --> 01:42:06.121
- I'm in the broad jump, Coach.
- Get him back on the bench. Broad jump!

01:42:06.205 --> 01:42:09.458
- Still 16-0.
- 16-0.

01:42:09.541 --> 01:42:12.920
Well, that's not bad. 16-0 in the first half.

01:42:13.003 --> 01:42:15.398
I guess I have to give them
the old Knute Rockne at half-time.

01:42:15.422 --> 01:42:17.466
- About time for the gun.
- Right.

01:42:22.054 --> 01:42:23.948
Hurts like a mother,
but how are we gonna score…

01:42:23.972 --> 01:42:28.268
Men, ever since the dark days
before Pearl Harbor,

01:42:28.352 --> 01:42:30.622
- I've been proud to wear this uniform.
- Boone, you got a towel?

01:42:30.646 --> 01:42:33.124
- Henry, have you pressed the bets yet?
- Today we are wearing…

01:42:33.148 --> 01:42:34.828
Henry, have you pressed
the bets yet, babe?

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.900
- The bets, the bets!
- Henry, press the bets, man.

01:42:37.069 --> 01:42:38.612
Finish, finish the half-time speech.

01:42:39.613 --> 01:42:42.783
Hit them with a mortar!
Kick them off the hill!

01:42:42.866 --> 01:42:46.226
- Mash them! Smash them! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Mash them! Smash them! Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:42:46.286 --> 01:42:50.082
Hot Lips! There's a time
and a place for everything, damn it!

01:42:51.208 --> 01:42:53.836
- Right. Bo-bo.
- Bo! Bo!

01:42:53.919 --> 01:42:56.296
Come on, Smitty. Come on, boy.

01:42:58.549 --> 01:43:00.235
- What's the matter with him?
- What's the matter with him?

01:43:00.259 --> 01:43:03.262
Hell, you ought to know.
You guys pulled something out there.

01:43:03.345 --> 01:43:05.185
Well, I guess you don't
want to double the bet.

01:43:05.264 --> 01:43:06.807
The hell I don't.

01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:09.560
We were beating you without him,
and we'll go on beating you.

01:43:09.643 --> 01:43:11.246
Are you prepared
to back that up with odds?

01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:14.064
Damn right. Three to one. Double the bet.

01:43:27.452 --> 01:43:29.371
Who's that 24? Who is he?

01:43:32.291 --> 01:43:34.042
Stop him! Stop him!

01:43:35.127 --> 01:43:39.798
Stop him! Stop him! Who is that guy?
He wasn't in the game in the first half.

01:43:39.882 --> 01:43:41.300
Stop him!

01:43:51.393 --> 01:43:53.896
- That's Spearchucker Jones.
- Spearchucker who?

01:43:53.979 --> 01:43:56.064
He played with San Francisco
before he got drafted.

01:43:56.148 --> 01:43:58.108
Boy, he's going to be tough to stop, too.

01:43:58.817 --> 01:44:00.903
Henry, you brought in a ringer, did you?

01:44:00.986 --> 01:44:05.949
- Radar, what's the general trying to say?
- Didn't bring him in the first half, did you?

01:44:06.033 --> 01:44:10.287
He's just been informed
as to the identity of our Spearchucker.

01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:12.289
His ringer's spotted our ringer.

01:44:12.372 --> 01:44:15.167
How do you like them apples, Charlie?

01:44:15.250 --> 01:44:19.504
- You can't trust anybody.
- Now watch him make the extra point.

01:44:25.677 --> 01:44:26.970
Isn't that illegal?

01:45:12.391 --> 01:45:16.979
What kind of team is it?
They're falling all around like dead flies!

01:45:26.029 --> 01:45:30.701
- Look! A red flag! We've got a red flag!
- Hot Lips!

01:45:32.911 --> 01:45:34.431
It's a penalty, you blithering idiots.

01:45:42.129 --> 01:45:46.341
Judson, get off of him.
You'll be thrown out of the game.

01:45:46.425 --> 01:45:48.468
Judson, kill him!

01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:59.187
What's wrong with you, huh?
We're here to play football, not fight!

01:46:02.065 --> 01:46:05.819
- Bastard 88 called me a coon.
- Called you a what?

01:46:07.112 --> 01:46:08.363
Coon.

01:46:09.364 --> 01:46:12.659
Okay, that's an old pro trick
to get you thrown out of the ballgame.

01:46:13.243 --> 01:46:15.203
Why don't you do the same thing to him?

01:46:15.287 --> 01:46:16.872
What, call him a coon?

01:46:16.955 --> 01:46:19.166
No, no, the boys in camp
used to talk about his sister.

01:46:19.249 --> 01:46:21.334
Her name was Gladys. Use it!

01:46:23.170 --> 01:46:25.380
- Yeah.
- All right, all right.

01:46:43.982 --> 01:46:46.651
What the hell are you doing,
for God's sake?

01:46:47.402 --> 01:46:48.820
What's the matter here?

01:46:49.696 --> 01:46:51.114
They're taking him out.

01:46:58.705 --> 01:47:03.668
- 69 is divine! 69 is divine!
- 69 is divine! 69 is divine!

01:47:03.752 --> 01:47:08.465
There you go, Charlie.
Another side of beef for your butcher shop.

01:47:08.548 --> 01:47:12.385
Let's get the ball and really go!
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

01:47:12.469 --> 01:47:15.597
- Who's the brunette? She a new one?
- Yeah, I just had her shipped in.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.850
Yeah. Not bad.
Kill them! Kill them, God damn it!

01:47:23.438 --> 01:47:25.774
My God! They've shot him!

01:47:25.857 --> 01:47:29.653
Hot Lips, you incredible nincompoop.
It's the end of the quarter.

01:47:29.736 --> 01:47:33.406
What did I make you a major for?
For a team like that?

01:47:33.490 --> 01:47:34.717
I did the best I could, Charlie.

01:47:34.741 --> 01:47:36.260
I didn't know
they were going to bring in a ringer.

01:47:36.284 --> 01:47:37.637
I ought to put you in there
and let them kill you,

01:47:37.661 --> 01:47:38.703
is what I ought to do.

01:47:38.787 --> 01:47:40.389
What about my knee, Charlie?
Remember my knee.

01:47:40.413 --> 01:47:44.084
You better get on your goddamn knee
and start praying. Trick knee, my ass.

01:48:16.366 --> 01:48:17.826
My God!

01:48:28.253 --> 01:48:29.921
- How's that?
- Did you see that?

01:48:30.005 --> 01:48:33.216
Get the hell back there. Get back there.

01:48:57.032 --> 01:49:00.493
Well, looks like we may make it.
Seconds to go.

01:49:00.577 --> 01:49:02.746
Okay, fellas,
we don't have very much time left.

01:49:02.829 --> 01:49:04.015
Now, I just checked with the ref.

01:49:04.039 --> 01:49:06.875
I got a special play I want to run with,
a center eligible play.

01:49:06.958 --> 01:49:10.378
We line up with everybody to the right
of the center except Hawkeye,

01:49:10.462 --> 01:49:13.381
who drops back one yard
just before the snap of the ball.

01:49:13.465 --> 01:49:14.942
Now, that makes you the semi-eligible,

01:49:14.966 --> 01:49:18.553
but all you have to do is take the ball
right back from Trapper between your legs

01:49:18.637 --> 01:49:23.558
and hide it under your belly
and walk toward their goal. All right?

01:49:23.642 --> 01:49:24.768
Trapper.

01:49:26.186 --> 01:49:27.187
We got it.

01:49:27.312 --> 01:49:30.899
All right. This is only one time. $5,000.

01:49:30.982 --> 01:49:32.734
- Worth a try.
- It'd be a miracle.

01:49:32.817 --> 01:49:33.818
I'm short one.

01:49:33.902 --> 01:49:35.671
- What do you say? What do you say?
- Let's do it now!

01:49:35.695 --> 01:49:36.821
Ready, Hawk?

01:49:36.905 --> 01:49:37.906
Ready!

01:49:39.616 --> 01:49:40.659
Set!

01:49:53.713 --> 01:49:56.424
- What are you doing? Get back!
- I got the ball!

01:49:56.508 --> 01:49:57.717
Run with it!

01:51:28.141 --> 01:51:30.185
- Two dollars.
- Two dollars.

01:51:34.105 --> 01:51:35.607
Four dollars.

01:51:36.608 --> 01:51:38.818
Out. I fold.

01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:41.696
Raise you two more. You raise his two?

01:51:43.531 --> 01:51:44.949
Raise you another two.

01:51:46.034 --> 01:51:49.037
- I have an Oklahoma.
- Oh, God!

01:51:52.457 --> 01:51:54.268
- What is that?
- Oklahoma. It's a pair of eights,

01:51:54.292 --> 01:51:56.628
- a ten of spades, a deuce, and a five.
- You win!

01:51:56.711 --> 01:51:58.546
What are you talking about?
What do you have?

01:51:58.630 --> 01:51:59.798
<i>Tokyo.</i>

01:52:00.298 --> 01:52:03.635
<i>The United States Armed Forces
Radio is on the air.</i>

01:52:37.168 --> 01:52:39.170
Duke? You busy?

01:52:41.256 --> 01:52:45.009
- What is it?
- Henry's got our orders. We can go home.

01:52:57.564 --> 01:52:58.731
Right now?

01:52:59.274 --> 01:53:01.693
Any time. Whenever we want.

01:53:01.776 --> 01:53:04.362
Do you mind
if we get out of this guy's brain first?

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:12.829
Can't you sew this thing up?
You got that vessel under control.

01:53:14.706 --> 01:53:15.707
Haven't you?

01:53:16.708 --> 01:53:19.669
I want to make sure the oozing
