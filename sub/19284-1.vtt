I've never heard of these places.

That's the point. Who wants to stay
in a place like this every night?

We can visit sponge fishermen
and an old monastery,

30:11.351 --> 30:15.051

- Yeah, there is.

45:05.069 --> 45:09.612
Sorry, gorillas are native
to Equatorial Africa.

45:09.741 --> 45:14.070
No gorillas. Not here. No way.

45:15.371 --> 45:18.455
Honey, stay on the path, OK?

45:22.086 --> 45:28.124
- I think he has a problem with you.
- The boss? No, we're like this.

- I can't dance to this. Nobody can.

45:48.652 --> 45:51.404
Check this out.

45:53.991 --> 45:58.818
- Come on. You know how to do this.
- Not in these shoes.

There's gorillas in the woods."

- It shows.

around here, I'll eat it.

47:03.431 --> 47:06.052
Gorillas. Right.

47:17.570 --> 47:23.156
He could have said "revolutionaries",
"freedom fighters". No.

47:23.283 --> 47:29.535
"Gorillas". He did it on purpose.
You can see it in his eyes...eye.

47:29.664 --> 47:35.204
- Martin, he'll hear you!
- Let him hear me.

47:35.336 --> 47:42.299
- He did convince them to let you go.
- Sorry. A true humanitarian.

47:42.426 --> 47:49.389
There's Terry Waite, Desmond Tutu
and Captain Ron. The big three.

47:51.518 --> 47:56.678
Boss? I just wanted...
More dry rot? Don't worry about it.

47:56.815 --> 48:02.319
I fixed the winch handle.
Try to be more careful, all right?

- Winch drum.

- Honey, don't start anything.
- I'm just getting a screwdriver.

- What difference does it make?
- I'm sick of being the thimble.

Well, I'm the top hat.

- Monopoly.

- Two .45s and a MAC-10.
-Just some macho trip.

48:36.519 --> 48:39.603
- Where did they come from?
- Ron traded with the guerrillas.

48:39.730 --> 48:43.858
- We're getting into pirate waters.
- Pirates?

48:43.984 --> 48:50.521
- Pirates of the Caribbean.
- Been to Disney World too many times?

48:50.657 --> 48:55.818
- It's true. They have speedboats.
- I've never been to Disney World.

- Dollywood...
- You made me lose count!

- No guns on this boat.
- We need to fight off pirates.

- They can steal the boat.
- There are no pirates here.

49:11.010 --> 49:16.348
- You said that about the guerrillas.
- I was right!

49:16.473 --> 49:20.685
He said "gorilla". Not "guerrilla".
"Guer", "go".

49:20.811 --> 49:24.808
Huge difference!

- What was that?
- Automatic weapons. How about that?

Captain Ron thought
we would have to hold off pirates!

49:50.756 --> 49:54.504
He actually traded... Hold on.

- Captain Ron!
- Yeah, Boss?

49:59.764 --> 50:04.806
- What did you trade?
- There's the beauty. Nothing. Nada.

and since we're...

This is my boat. You understand?

50:12.526 --> 50:16.654
We don't give lifts
to armed revolutionaries.

50:16.780 --> 50:22.201
Whatever you say. I'll return the guns
and the whole thing's off.

- Control your excitement, Caroline.

Trust me, you have not been kidnapped.
Captain Ron is a jerk.

He gets lost.
This is his second time in two days.

They don't know English, I don't
know Spanish. No communication.

54:07.457 --> 54:13.660
Well, everything is cool. When you
get lost, all you got to do is ask.

54:13.796 --> 54:15.623
What?

54:15.756 --> 54:22.339
San Juan is behind us. About 20 miles.
But General Armando hardly blames you.

I explained it to him. It's the tides.
They work for you or against you. Hey!

54:34.023 --> 54:37.107
- She's not?
- I sincerely doubt it.

Babe! Who are you waving at?

54:46.994 --> 54:51.122
Yeah, I thought so. When I saw
Clarice, I knew where we was.

Confidentially, I've had
these problems with the tides before.

- Why do you think I'm not all right?

56:51.486 --> 56:53.728
You still there?

56:54.156 --> 57:01.118
I have to say this was worth getting
lost for. It's absolutely gorgeous.

57:01.871 --> 57:04.540
I just wish that you could see it.

I was against all this.

was quite a rush for all of us.

57:44.828 --> 57:49.739

something in the cabin.

- You're a big boy. You get them.

without the patch. It puts people off.

01:06:11.432 --> 01:06:14.801
I don't like
to draw attention to myself.

01:06:17.688 --> 01:06:21.388
I got news for you, Ron.
If I had a hand mirror...

01:06:21.608 --> 01:06:26.733
Caroline, honey...

01:06:26.946 --> 01:06:30.814
- That was so cool!
- Let's take a walk, shall we?

01:06:31.034 --> 01:06:33.785
You kids keep up. Let's go.

01:06:42.586 --> 01:06:48.090
Yes, I admit that Captain Ron
is a little rough around the edges.

01:06:48.216 --> 01:06:55.678
- No, he is a psycho.
- Well, what does that mean?

01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:00.432
Help me out. I lost my eye.
You see it? There it goes.

01:07:00.561 --> 01:07:06.813
I love this. I love it!
This is an experience of a lifetime!

01:07:07.026 --> 01:07:10.858
Hang on! There it is!

01:07:10.988 --> 01:07:14.357
Would you please back off!
I lost my eye, man!

01:07:14.491 --> 01:07:18.619
Caroline hasn't mentioned
being engaged. And Ben...

01:07:18.745 --> 01:07:24.581
Let me tell you about Ben. I wanted
this to be a bonding experience.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:29.336
Father and son. Now he's bonding
with Captain Cyclops!

01:07:29.464 --> 01:07:32.299
He's such a character.

01:07:34.552 --> 01:07:36.877
Honey, where are the kids?

01:07:37.013 --> 01:07:39.385
They're there. Ben!

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:43.466
They were right there. Caroline!

01:07:44.812 --> 01:07:47.647

Ben!

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:04.454
- Did you find them?
- What? No.

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:11.707
Forget it. Never did fit, anyway.
You gotta get them custom made.

Hey! Where's Mom and Dad?

01:08:18.468 --> 01:08:24.055
It wasn't smart to mention we brought
revolutionaries to the island.

01:08:24.182 --> 01:08:27.716
I'm not starting a fight.
It's just my opinion.

01:08:27.852 --> 01:08:31.979
I was trying to show
the kind of person Captain Ron is.

01:08:32.106 --> 01:08:36.234
I'm Bill Zachary from the U.S.
State Department. Good news.

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:38.850

- No.

- You guys are back early.

- The merengue.

- Where is your brother?
- He's around. You guys!

01:10:11.116 --> 01:10:16.276
Captain Ron didn't want us wandering
around. So we found this band

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:19.497
and these people,
and we just had a party!

01:10:19.624 --> 01:10:23.408
We were worried sick
the whole time we were in jail.

01:10:23.545 --> 01:10:28.123
- In jail?
- Don't worry. Who's this guy?

01:10:28.258 --> 01:10:34.177
Mamba! He doesn't speak English,
but he's cute. Guess what?

01:10:34.388 --> 01:10:38.386
- You're engaged.
- No, I didn't get engaged.

01:10:38.517 --> 01:10:43.677
I got tattooed. Mamba did it.
It's a cool little rose.

01:10:43.814 --> 01:10:47.432
- Where did you get this tattoo?
- At Mamba's shop.

01:10:47.567 --> 01:10:53.154
- Where on your body?
- Mom, it's kind of private.

01:10:53.365 --> 01:10:57.658
A guy with a spider on his head
tattooed you somewhere private?

01:10:57.869 --> 01:11:00.538
- It could be a lot worse.
- How?

01:11:00.747 --> 01:11:04.696

- We're playing strip Monopoly.

- We ran out of money. She's...
- Where's Ben?

01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:51.460
- He went that way.
- You tattooed my kids!

Curve it a second, boss - former

01:12:40.341 --> 01:12:43.460

before you got back.

01:12:43.594 --> 01:12:47.722

- I would. Beat it.

- Get back on the boat!
- You're embarrassing me.

We'll sell this thing and go home.

In five hours the stores open.
We can get some clothes.

as best as you can.

the stupid thing, and we sailed it.

01:27:17.919 --> 01:27:21.253
Naturals! Every one of ya's naturals!

01:27:22.006 --> 01:27:25.091
We're gonna fucking die.

01:27:29.639 --> 01:27:31.049
Man!

01:27:34.185 --> 01:27:39.060
Caroline, get the gaskets!
Katherine, on the mizzenmast!

01:27:39.273 --> 01:27:42.143
Ben, the mainsheets!

01:27:50.742 --> 01:27:53.529
Good going, Katy! Go!

01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:06.414
We're too far into the wind!
We gotta bring her around!

01:28:09.593 --> 01:28:12.166
Caroline, come here.

01:28:14.556 --> 01:28:15.884
Pull back.

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.473
Mayday!

01:28:25.316 --> 01:28:27.558
- Pull!
- I'm trying.

01:28:27.777 --> 01:28:31.477
- You're tough. You've got a tattoo.
- A little one!

01:28:31.697 --> 01:28:34.188
Be a little tough, then.

01:28:34.408 --> 01:28:37.824
Guantánamo, wake up!

01:28:50.298 --> 01:28:52.919
Attaboy, Boss. You got the wind.

01:28:55.511 --> 01:28:59.129
- Go, go, go. Hang on.
- I got it.

01:29:05.854 --> 01:29:08.061
- OK, I got it!
- Got it?

01:29:24.163 --> 01:29:25.788
It's awesome, Dad!

01:29:44.099 --> 01:29:45.759
Dad!

01:29:52.941 --> 01:29:56.559
- Maybe it's nobody.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:30:01.532 --> 01:30:06.609
We're doing our job, you do yours!
These people are taxpayers!

01:30:23.469 --> 01:30:26.589
Oh, geez! Gunplay!

01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:33.479
Are you born stupid? Stay down!

01:30:33.938 --> 01:30:37.852
- They're not gonna shoot at us!
- What are you doing?

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:41.731
I'll blow a hole
in their boat with this!

01:30:41.945 --> 01:30:44.816
This is a serious call for help!

01:30:45.031 --> 01:30:48.068
That's different. We had dry rot!

01:30:52.997 --> 01:30:57.540
- There are children on this boat!
- We've had enough!

01:30:57.752 --> 01:31:00.373
- Mom is pissed.
- Adiós!

01:31:06.552 --> 01:31:08.509
How much did you pay for this?

01:31:09.137 --> 01:31:11.807
Mom! Over there!

01:31:13.975 --> 01:31:17.391
- Who's that?
- It's the U.S. Coast Guard!

01:31:19.647 --> 01:31:22.767
We're the Harvey family from Chicago!

01:31:31.033 --> 01:31:34.781
- I'll get them on the radio.
- We're Americans!

01:31:36.372 --> 01:31:40.583
All right!
Coast Guard kicking ass!

01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:54.468
The leg is a lot better. I heal fast.
I believe in Jesus, so that helps.

01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:01.477
<i>U.S. Coast Guard calling</i>
<i>60-foot ketch off Los Palominos.</i>

01:32:01.812 --> 01:32:03.639
This is "The Wanderer".

01:32:03.856 --> 01:32:09.277
<i>This is Commander Morgan.</i>
<i>May we speak with the captain?</i>

01:32:11.113 --> 01:32:14.481
<i>May we speak</i>
<i>with the captain, please?</i>

01:32:14.699 --> 01:32:18.946
That's you, Boss.
You're the captain now.

01:32:37.471 --> 01:32:39.926
<i>Day 30. New log.</i>

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:45.300
<i>Old log fell into the hands</i>
<i>of the Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

01:32:46.021 --> 01:32:49.140
<i>We said goodbye</i>
<i>to Captain Ron today.</i>

01:32:49.357 --> 01:32:51.765
<i>He hadn't been back for 7 years.</i>

01:32:52.026 --> 01:32:54.897
<i>Something about</i>
<i>the statute of limitations.</i>

01:32:55.113 --> 01:32:57.782
<i>I didn't ask questions.</i>

01:32:59.450 --> 01:33:03.447
<i>He kept his promise to Ben,</i>
<i>promoting him to mate.</i>

01:33:03.662 --> 01:33:06.283
Bye, Captain Ron.

01:33:08.876 --> 01:33:11.829
<i>He traded hair grooming</i>
<i>tips with Caroline.</i>

01:33:15.882 --> 01:33:17.590
We're gonna miss you.

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:22.261
<i>And he kissed Katherine.</i>
<i>I think he French kissed her.</i>

01:33:23.639 --> 01:33:25.596
You're a lucky man, Boss.

01:33:33.857 --> 01:33:38.733
<i>Then, as suddenly</i>
<i>as he'd come into our lives...</i>

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:41.816
Captain Ron!

01:33:43.867 --> 01:33:49.537
<i>..he was gone.</i>
<i>And our adventure was over.</i>

01:34:02.218 --> 01:34:06.760
Once the Harvey boat comes in,
pull it out of the water.

01:34:06.972 --> 01:34:11.634
- You want it surveyed?
- No, it's a piece of junk.

01:34:11.852 --> 01:34:18.055
Set it down back, and we'll cut it up
for scrap and salvage what we can.

01:34:25.156 --> 01:34:28.940
Tomorrow at this time
we're gonna be home.

01:35:11.366 --> 01:35:17.819
We can do one of two things.
Sell the boat and go back to Chicago

01:35:18.039 --> 01:35:20.910
or don't!

01:35:26.297 --> 01:35:30.045
- OK. Coming about!
- Good going!

01:35:34.722 --> 01:35:37.391
Hey! HEY!

01:35:38.809 --> 01:35:40.469
Where are you going?

01:35:44.773 --> 01:35:47.228
Over here!

01:35:50.403 --> 01:35:54.697
- Where are we going, skipper?
- I don't know.

01:35:56.284 --> 01:36:02.322
"But if we get lost, we'll just pull
in somewheres and ask directions."

01:36:10.047 --> 01:36:12.620
Oh, boy! Look at that, Barbara.

01:36:14.634 --> 01:36:17.635
Do you think we'll be able to do that?

01:36:17.846 --> 01:36:20.930
Sure you will, Boss. I guarantee it.

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:25.185
Let's light the fires
and kick the tyres. Push that back.

01:36:25.394 --> 01:36:27.221
Hang on a second.

01:36:29.732 --> 01:36:34.808
You forgot to cast off.
It could happen to anybody.

01:36:35.028 --> 01:36:39.073
We want to check the boat out.
We bought it yesterday.

01:36:39.282 --> 01:36:44.703
Get her out on the ocean.
If it's gonna happen, it's out there!

01:36:46.706 --> 01:36:48.782
There's a lot of boats!

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.077
They'll get out of our way.
I learned that on the "Saratoga".
