WEBVTT

03:01.765 --> 03:03.516
l looked them up .

03:04.309 --> 03:06.143
They're aphids.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.856
They're in my hair, on my skin ,
in my lungs .

03:10.065 --> 03:13.192
And the pain , Barris, it's unreasonable .

03:13.402 --> 03:15.152
They're all over the place .

03:16.864 --> 03:20.157
-They've completely gotten Millie too .
<i>-Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.</i>

03:20.242 --> 03:23.786
Listen , you gotta get out of there .
l'll meet you over at Joe's Cafe at 3 .

03:23.996 --> 03:25.705
Calm down , everything's gonna be fine .

03:25.914 --> 03:28.541
Put a couple of them in a jar
so l can get them examined .

03:28.792 --> 03:30.793
l'm sure they're aphids ,
but you never know.

03:31.003 --> 03:34.505
Just in case , okay? Just do it.
Relax, relax.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.615
Gentlemen of the Anaheim 709th chapter
of the Brown Bear Lodge . . .

04:00.824 --> 04:03.200
. . .we have a wonderful opportunity
this afternoon .

04:03.327 --> 04:05.912
The county of Orange has provided us
with a chance . . .

04:06.121 --> 04:08.831
. . .to hear from and put questions to . . .

04:09.041 --> 04:12.710
. . . an undercover narcotics agent
who is out there on our behalf. . .

04:12.920 --> 04:15.212
. . .fighting this awful
Substance D epidemic.

04:15.339 --> 04:18.214
lt's no secret we're living
in a culture of addiction .

04:18.341 --> 04:22.219
Nearly 20 percent of the population
can now be classified as addicts .

04:22.387 --> 04:25.222
And as far as anyone can tell ,
there is but one company . . .

04:25.223 --> 04:28.225
. . .that is working and helping
this situation .

04:28.310 --> 04:31.562
That company is our sponsor, New Path .

04:38.111 --> 04:40.237
You will notice
you can barely see this man . . .

04:40.238 --> 04:43.449
. . . because he is wearing
what is called a "scramble suit."

04:43.659 --> 04:46.577
The exact same suit he wears
and , in fact, must wear. . .

04:46.787 --> 04:51.248
. . .during certain parts , in fact, most parts ,
of his daily activities of law enforcement.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.002
This man , whom we will call Fred
because that is the code name . . .

04:55.212 --> 04:57.380
. . . under which he reports
information he gathers . . .

04:57.673 --> 04:59.382
. . .once within the scramble suit. . .

04:59.591 --> 05:03.678
. . .cannot be detected by even the latest
in voice- and facial-recognition technology .

05:03.887 --> 05:06.263
The scramble suit itself
is purportedly made up . . .

05:06.431 --> 05:10.393
. . .of approximately a million and a half
fraction-representations . . .

05:10.602 --> 05:14.647
. . .of men , women , and children
in every variant. . .

05:14.856 --> 05:19.068
. . . making the wearer of a scramble suit
the ultimate Everyman .

05:19.277 --> 05:21.112
This is terrible .

05:21.488 --> 05:24.532
He looks , does he not,
like a constantly shifting , vague blur. . .

05:24.741 --> 05:26.701
. . . and nothing more , am l right?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.204
Let's hear it for the vague blur.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.549
lf you saw me on the street
without this suit on , you'd say:

05:41.758 --> 05:44.427
"There goes a total dope fiend ."

05:44.636 --> 05:47.304
You'd feel aversion and walk away .

05:47.764 --> 05:50.391
l don't look like you . l can't afford to .

05:51.226 --> 05:53.310
My life depends on it.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.647
l'm not going to tell you first
what l do as an undercover officer. . .

05:56.857 --> 06:00.276
. . .tracking down dealers and the source
of their illegal drugs . . .

06:00.318 --> 06:03.320
. . . in the streets of our cities
and corridors of our schools . . .

06:03.488 --> 06:05.573
. . . here in Orange County .

06:06.158 --> 06:08.617
l'm going to tell you what l'm afraid of.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.746
What l fear, night and day ,
is that our children . . .

06:13.331 --> 06:14.957
. . .your children and my children--

06:15.167 --> 06:19.336
l have two little ones , very little . . .

06:19.421 --> 06:22.089
. . . but not too little to be addicted .

06:22.299 --> 06:27.344
Calculatedly addicted to Substance D
for profit by drug terrorists .

06:28.346 --> 06:30.848
As many of you know,
our military and their associates . . .

06:31.058 --> 06:33.059
. . . are actively engaged in countries . . .

06:33.268 --> 06:36.353
. . .where it is believed
the organic component of Substance D . . .

06:37.939 --> 06:40.357
. . . a small , highly toxic flower, originates .

06:42.736 --> 06:45.362
And while our troops are down there
fighting for us . . .

06:45.363 --> 06:48.908
. . . it is up to each and every
one of us here . . .

06:49.117 --> 06:53.662
. . .to do our part in eliminating
the demand for this drug .

06:53.872 --> 06:56.457
lt's important you as citizens
continue to report. . .

06:56.666 --> 07:00.503
. . . all suspicious activity and individuals. . .

07:00.712 --> 07:04.965
. . .for, simply put, if there were
no demand in our society . . .

07:05.175 --> 07:08.385
. . .there would be no market
for these leeches to exploit.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.645
Each day , this disease
takes its toll on us .

07:17.854 --> 07:21.857
And each day , the flow of profits
and where they go . . . .

07:26.488 --> 07:30.407
Well , it isn't about the profits anyhow,
it's something else .

07:32.410 --> 07:34.203
What'd you see happen?

07:37.707 --> 07:40.668
lf you were a diabetic
and you didn't have money for insulin . . .

07:40.877 --> 07:43.420
. . .would you steal to get the money
or just die?

07:43.505 --> 07:46.841
<i>l think you better go back to the ,</i>
<i>you know, prepared text there , Fred .</i>

07:48.927 --> 07:52.680
l forgot it.
l think l have a block against this shit.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.391
<i>Repeat after me ,</i>
<i>but make it sound casual .</i>

07:55.433 --> 07:57.101
<i>"Where the profits flow,</i>
<i>we will s--</i>

08:02.774 --> 08:04.733
<i>--and then</i>
<i>retribution will swiftly follow .</i>

08:04.943 --> 08:08.445
<i>At that moment, l would not</i>
<i>want to be in their shoes. " Got it?</i>

08:08.530 --> 08:11.824
You know why l've got a block
against this bullshit?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.827
Because this is what gets people
on drugs .

08:15.036 --> 08:18.581
lt's all so disgusting you want to lurch off
and become a user.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.584
<i>Come on , Fred, just say this shit</i>
<i>and get it over with .</i>

08:28.550 --> 08:30.342
Anyway . . . .

08:32.095 --> 08:34.346
Substance D .

08:34.472 --> 08:35.972
D .

08:36.683 --> 08:41.187
D is for dumbness and despair
and desertion .

08:41.395 --> 08:45.441
The desertion of your friends from you ,
you from your friends .

08:45.483 --> 08:47.484
Everyone from everyone .

08:48.486 --> 08:51.488
lsolation and loneliness . . .

08:52.407 --> 08:56.493
. . . and hating and suspecting each other.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.955
D is, finally , death .

09:02.000 --> 09:03.792
Slow death .

09:04.794 --> 09:07.087
From the head down .

09:10.884 --> 09:14.595
Well , that's it.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.564
Okay , let's eat.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.873
All right, what's your name?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.626
My name . . . .

09:47.504 --> 09:49.797
You don't know your name?
Well , that's interesting .

09:50.757 --> 09:53.175
Probable cause . Out of the car, sir.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.012
Now, you have the right
to remain silent until . . . .

09:57.555 --> 10:03.727
And . . . . And anything you say can and will
be used against you when you . . . .

10:04.479 --> 10:05.980
When what?

10:06.189 --> 10:08.232
You know, fuck this shit.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.195
-Hello?
-Hey , how you doing?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.655
Oh , l'm all right.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.657
<i>Anything wrong?</i>

11:40.742 --> 11:43.660
Just this fucker stole 50 bucks' worth
of shit from us today .

11:44.662 --> 11:48.332
<i>And my boss said it was somehow my fault,</i>
<i>and it's coming out of my paycheck. . .</i>

11:48.541 --> 11:54.046
<i>. . .which l don't even think is legal .</i>
<i>l mean , can he legally do that?</i>

11:54.255 --> 11:55.506
<i>Yeah , they can't do that.</i>

11:57.884 --> 12:00.677
<i>At least, they used to not</i>
<i>be able to do that. l'll check.</i>

12:01.429 --> 12:03.931
<i>Hey, Donna, can l get anything from you?</i>

12:05.100 --> 12:06.809
<i>Yeah , how much?</i>

12:07.018 --> 12:08.936
<i>-Ten .</i>
<i>-Ten?</i>

12:09.145 --> 12:12.356
<i>Yeah , l'm hurting really bad .</i>
<i>l'll pay you back later.</i>

12:13.817 --> 12:17.694
<i>-Yeah , okay . Say, day after tomorrow?</i>
<i>-Any sooner?</i>

12:17.904 --> 12:20.739
<i>l'll come by later, like around 8?</i>

12:20.949 --> 12:22.616
<i>Yeah . l'll see you later.</i>

12:24.702 --> 12:27.371
<i>-Okay . All right, bye .</i>
<i>-Okay, bye .</i>

12:29.916 --> 12:33.710
You see , all symptoms are purposeful ,
be they positive or negative .

12:33.795 --> 12:35.963
You see?
l wouldn't feel strangely about it.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.091
Just the idea of turning yourself
over for rehabilitation . . .

12:39.300 --> 12:41.885
. . . is only naturally gonna make you
a little apprehensive .

12:42.095 --> 12:44.721
But that's just a manifestation
of the fear.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.724
lt's just the:
That's the D talking .

12:47.725 --> 12:51.645
You know, the first thing l hear,
that when you go into the New Path . . .

12:51.729 --> 12:54.231
. . .what they do to you ,
they cut your pecker off.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.401
They could never get away with that.
You kidding? That's a myth .

12:57.610 --> 13:00.404
lt's actually the spleen
that's remanded to their custody .

13:00.613 --> 13:02.739
-The what?
-Hey , how is everything?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.199
Everything is super good .

13:04.409 --> 13:07.744
Not with me .
l got a lot of problems nobody else has .

13:07.787 --> 13:10.080
No , no , come on .
More people than you'd think.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.667
And more people each day .
This is a world getting progressively worse .

13:13.751 --> 13:14.877
Can we not agree on that?

13:16.171 --> 13:19.590
-What's on the dessert menu?
-Would you like to order some dessert?

13:19.757 --> 13:21.133
Like what?

13:23.178 --> 13:25.762
Well , we have fresh strawberry pie . . .

13:25.805 --> 13:29.475
. . . and fresh peach pie
that we make here ourselves .

13:32.729 --> 13:36.440
-No , we don't want any dessert.
-All right.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.568
Fucking fruit pies are for old ladies.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.821
-What do you think about New Path?
-While it doesn't matter. . .

13:43.031 --> 13:45.866
. . .what l think, l kind of
have to tip my hat to any entity . . .

13:46.075 --> 13:48.410
. . .that can bring
so much integrity to evil .

13:48.620 --> 13:51.955
l mean , imagine this:
A seemingly voluntary , privatized gulag . . .

13:52.165 --> 13:56.335
. . . managed to eliminate the middlemen
of public accountability and free will .

13:56.544 --> 13:58.712
Wrapped it up in a bow
and gave it like a gift.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.672
l mean , come on , this is:

14:03.218 --> 14:04.885
This is awe-inspiring stuff.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.805
l heard you have to go cold turkey .

14:08.890 --> 14:12.601
Cold turkey doesn't even apply
to Substance D .

14:13.353 --> 14:19.233
Unlike the legacy of inherited predisposition
to addictive behavior or substances . . .

14:19.442 --> 14:21.860
. . .this needs no genetic assistance .

14:22.362 --> 14:25.531
There's no weekend warriors on the D .
You're either on it. . .

14:26.824 --> 14:28.075
. . .or you haven't tried it.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.828
-Well , l like it.
-Yeah .

14:32.622 --> 14:34.248
How many caps do you take per day?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.546
Very difficult to determine .

14:41.506 --> 14:43.090
But not that many .

14:43.299 --> 14:47.094
Well , like the old-school pharmacopoeia,
a tolerance develops , you know.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.847
These visions of bugs,
they're just garden-variety psychosis . . .

14:50.932 --> 14:53.183
. . . but a clear indication
that you've hurdled . . .

14:53.393 --> 14:56.853
. . .over the initial fun and euphoric phase
and passed on . . .

14:57.689 --> 14:59.856
. . .to the next phase .

15:00.149 --> 15:03.777
News from the guinea-pig grapevine
suggests that whatever it is . . .

15:03.861 --> 15:07.281
. . .we won't know
until it's way too late , you see?

15:07.490 --> 15:10.367
You see that we're all canaries
in the coalmine on this one?

15:10.785 --> 15:13.203
l do think l have another source .

15:13.413 --> 15:15.330
That Donna chick.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.374
-Bob's girl?
-Yeah .

15:17.584 --> 15:21.295
Yeah , his girl . Although l know
for a fact he never gets in her pants .

15:21.504 --> 15:23.255
Really?

15:24.799 --> 15:27.342
-But he talks like he does.
-Oh , yeah .

15:27.552 --> 15:30.137
That's Bob Arctor.
He talks like he does many things .

15:30.346 --> 15:33.098
That's not the same , my friend .
That's not the same thing .

15:33.308 --> 15:36.226
Donna has an aversion to bodily contact.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.396
l mean , junkies lose their interest in sex,
you realize . . .

15:39.606 --> 15:42.899
. . .due to organs swelling up
from vasoconstriction .

15:42.984 --> 15:47.904
And l have observed in her
an inordinate failure of sexual arousal . . .

15:48.031 --> 15:50.365
. . . not just toward Bob Arctor. . .

15:52.243 --> 15:53.994
. . . but other males as well .

15:54.203 --> 15:56.997
l can't believe she doesn't put out.

15:57.206 --> 16:01.543
Well , she would if she were handled right.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.340
For instance , l could show you
how to sleep with her. . .

16:06.549 --> 16:08.508
. . .for less than 3 dollars .

16:10.887 --> 16:13.930
l don't wanna sleep with her.
l wanna buy from her.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.266
Donna does coke , all right?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.560
Three dollars doesn't get you
a line of coke .

16:18.770 --> 16:20.062
That's where you're wrong , pal .

17:07.984 --> 17:09.611
What they've deliberately done . . .

17:09.820 --> 17:12.571
. . . is mix the cocaine with the oil
so it cannot be extracted .

17:12.781 --> 17:16.326
But my knowledge of chemistry is such . . .

17:16.536 --> 17:21.998
. . .that l know precisely
how to separate the oil from the cocaine .

17:23.084 --> 17:26.002
Now, now l will freeze it.

17:26.337 --> 17:30.716
Cause cocaine crystals to rise to the top
because they are lighter than the oil .

17:30.925 --> 17:33.719
The terminal step , of course ,
l keep to myself. . .

17:33.928 --> 17:39.099
. . . but suffice to say , it involves an intricate
and methodological process of filtering .

17:40.727 --> 17:42.936
How long is it gonna be in there?

17:43.020 --> 17:45.021
Just about a half an hour.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.441
You know, l've been thinking , Barris.

17:47.650 --> 17:51.737
Even if we do get a pure gram of cocaine
out of this deal . . .

17:51.946 --> 17:54.656
. . . l don't wanna use it on Donna
to get in her pants .

17:54.866 --> 17:57.325
-That'd be like buying her.
-No , it'd be an exchange .

17:57.535 --> 18:00.036
You give her a gift,
and she gives you one .

18:03.875 --> 18:07.711
Besides, we're talking about
Bob's girl here .

18:08.379 --> 18:10.130
And this is his house . He's my friend .

18:10.339 --> 18:13.008
He lets you and Luckman live here .

18:14.218 --> 18:18.138
There's a great deal about Bob Arctor
you're not aware of.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.062
How did New Path rig it?

18:26.105 --> 18:29.274
They're the one place in our entire country
that can't be scanned .

18:29.484 --> 18:31.902
All the rest of us can be tracked
24 hours a day . . .

18:32.069 --> 18:34.070
. . . but no , not at New Path .

18:34.071 --> 18:36.740
Hey , that's their contract
with the government.

18:37.241 --> 18:41.703
But l think you're right, it would be
a good place for a dealer to hide .

18:44.081 --> 18:46.917
What about Donna Hawthorne?

18:48.085 --> 18:50.712
l'm systematically working up
to her supplier.

18:50.922 --> 18:54.508
The quantities l'm buying now
are basically beyond her capacity .

18:54.717 --> 18:57.010
She doesn't have
enough front money to handle it.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.680
Matter of time before she's hooking me up
with the next person up the ladder.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.308
l think soon we'll have somebody
who knows something . . .

19:03.518 --> 19:05.101
. . . and they'll be worth busting .

19:05.311 --> 19:08.104
What about Jim Barris and Ernie Luckman?

19:08.773 --> 19:10.524
Same shit. Nothing new.

19:10.733 --> 19:14.569
Well , what about Charles Freck
and Robert Arctor?

19:16.113 --> 19:19.115
-Up to pretty much the same old thing .
-Even Arctor?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.828
Arctor?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.122
Yeah , he doesn't seem to be doing much .

19:26.165 --> 19:29.751
Still working his nowhere ,
Handy Brake and Tire job .

19:29.961 --> 19:33.129
Drops a few caps of Death
cut with meth during the day .

19:33.297 --> 19:34.840
l'm not so sure .

19:35.049 --> 19:36.967
We just got a tip in from an informant. . .

19:37.134 --> 19:39.344
. . .that Arctor has funds
above and beyond . . .

19:39.554 --> 19:42.180
. . .what he gets from his little job .

19:42.390 --> 19:44.140
And when we checked into it. . .

19:44.225 --> 19:47.602
. . .we found he wasn't even
working there full-time .

19:48.437 --> 19:49.855
Yeah .

19:50.606 --> 19:52.357
Who's this informant?

19:52.567 --> 19:53.817
We don't know.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.404
Undoubtedly it's a vengeance burn .
That's how these druggies are .

19:57.613 --> 20:01.157
l mean , phoning in on each other
every time they get pissed off.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.159
Anyhow, as of now. . .

20:03.160 --> 20:06.162
. . . l'm officially assigning you
to observe Arctor.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.168
lf we're ever gonna get to the bottom
of this, it'll be through this guy .

20:12.545 --> 20:15.839
So will that mean
full-time viewer recording?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.924
We got no choice .

20:18.134 --> 20:20.260
We'll install a new
holographic scanning system .

20:20.469 --> 20:22.804
You'll let us know
when they're out of the house .

20:23.014 --> 20:25.891
We'll want storage and printout
on everything .

20:29.312 --> 20:35.191
Total , total , total , totally ,
total , total , total providence .

20:35.318 --> 20:38.612
l am walking home ,
l find myself on a street l am rarely on . . .

20:38.821 --> 20:42.032
. . . and look what l obtain for a mere $50 .

20:42.199 --> 20:45.201
-What is it?
-Oh , this would be an 1 8-speed bike . . .

20:45.202 --> 20:46.828
. . .of the all-terrain variety .

20:47.038 --> 20:50.707
l noticed it in a neighbor's yard ,
and l inquired as to its availability .

20:50.917 --> 20:53.209
They had four of them .
So l made a cash offer.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.880
-Don't. Drugs .
-Fifty dollars. They acquiesced .

20:57.089 --> 20:59.215
They threw in these
lemon-yellow racing pants .

20:59.216 --> 21:02.761
Even hoisted it over the fence for me ,
which l found to be very neighborly .

21:02.970 --> 21:07.432
Well , that's weird . l didn't know you could
get a 1 8-speed bike nearly new for $50 .

21:07.642 --> 21:09.893
lt's amazing what you can get for $50 .

21:10.102 --> 21:12.437
l'll give you 60 right now,
no questions asked .

21:12.647 --> 21:15.148
You know,
this bike looks a lot like the bike . . .

21:15.232 --> 21:19.235
. . .that this girl that lives across the street
had that got ripped off a month ago .

21:19.236 --> 21:20.695
This bike could be hot.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.490
They probably jacked it,
these hoister friends of yours .

21:23.699 --> 21:26.242
Sure did , if they've got four
and selling it that cheap .

21:26.369 --> 21:30.246
Right? You should at least show it to her
so she could see if it's hers .

21:30.456 --> 21:31.873
Yeah . Okay , l can do that. . .

21:32.083 --> 21:35.043
. . . but this is a boy's bike , okay?
So it can't be .

21:35.252 --> 21:38.546
Not to invalidate your intuition ,
but it's not possible . Thank you .

21:38.756 --> 21:42.258
Why do you say it's an 1 8-speed
when it only has nine gears?

21:42.718 --> 21:44.260
Huh , what?

21:44.261 --> 21:48.139
Yeah . Yeah . Six right here ,
three at the other end of the chain .

21:48.265 --> 21:50.976
Six plus three equals nine .

21:51.978 --> 21:54.938
-lt's a nine-speed bike .
-Yeah , but even a nine-speed bike . . .

21:55.147 --> 21:57.565
. . .for 50 bucks. He still got a good deal .

21:57.900 --> 21:59.776
Okay , those guys told me
it was 1 8 speeds .

21:59.986 --> 22:01.987
l just got Greeked . l just got. . . .

22:02.196 --> 22:03.905
Wait. Wait.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.282
Now l count eight.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.618
Six here and then two in the front.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.246
-That makes eight.
-What do you think happened . . .

22:11.288 --> 22:13.289
- . . .to the missing gears?
-Think? l know.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.625
They were working
on it, these gypsy grifters . . .

22:15.835 --> 22:18.003
. . .with improper tools ,
no technical knowledge .

22:18.212 --> 22:20.046
No understanding of reverse engineering .

22:20.256 --> 22:22.841
When they attempted to reassemble it,
they panicked .

22:23.050 --> 22:25.301
They left nine orphan gears there
on the floor.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.262
They're still there
on the garage floor.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.639
Let's just go rescue
the orphan gears , dude!

22:29.849 --> 22:32.559
Don't you see that that's part of the plan?

22:32.768 --> 22:35.437
They're going to try to sell them to me ,
not give them . . .

22:35.646 --> 22:39.899
. . . as they rightfully should have as included
in a part of the original sale price .

22:40.109 --> 22:43.319
Oh , my God , there's no telling
what else they've bait-and-switched .

22:43.487 --> 22:46.781
Yeah , but if all of us go together,
oh , they'll give them back.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.325
Oh , you bet they will .
Oh , you bet they will .

22:49.410 --> 22:52.328
-Let's just go as a team , okay .
-Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.540
Are you sure there are only nine gears
on this bike?

22:56.292 --> 22:58.626
-Eight.
-Okay , eight, nine , whatever.

22:58.836 --> 23:03.339
Don't you think that before we go over
and accuse , and start some shit. . .

23:03.549 --> 23:05.091
. . .we should find out for sure?

23:05.301 --> 23:07.594
Right, Donna.
Who do we know who's an authority . . .

23:07.803 --> 23:09.471
. . .on this type of bi--?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.640
Get off me!

23:12.850 --> 23:14.434
Let me--

23:14.643 --> 23:17.562
We are all way too close to this .

23:18.355 --> 23:20.148
There's only one thing we can do . . .

23:20.357 --> 23:23.276
. . .to thwart these albino ,
shape-shifting lizard bitches .

23:23.360 --> 23:26.196
We are gonna take this outside ,
ask the first person we see .

23:26.363 --> 23:29.365
lntroduce some novelty .
That way we get an objective viewpoint.

23:29.575 --> 23:30.825
Yeah .

23:32.119 --> 23:34.454
By the way , l might take you up
on that $60 offer.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.289
No , that was for an 1 8-speed .

23:36.373 --> 23:38.833
You know, for this , 1 8 minus 1 0 ,
l'll give you 23 . 75 .

23:39.043 --> 23:42.212
Are you certain
that's the right math on that?

23:43.380 --> 23:44.798
Come in .

23:48.385 --> 23:50.678
You are Officer F red?

23:51.722 --> 23:54.390
-Yes .
-Have a seat, please .

24:01.190 --> 24:03.066
All right, Fred .

24:03.275 --> 24:05.235
We're going to administer
several tests . . .

24:05.486 --> 24:08.238
. . . and there will be no
physical discomfort involved .

24:09.073 --> 24:11.366
lf this is about the speech l gave to the--

24:11.408 --> 24:14.744
What this is about
stems from a recent departmental survey . . .

24:14.954 --> 24:17.413
. . . showing that undercover agents
have been admitted . . .

24:17.623 --> 24:21.000
. . .to neural-aphasia clinics
during the last month .

24:21.210 --> 24:24.587
You're conscious of the high factor
of addictiveness of Substance D?

24:24.797 --> 24:28.508
-Of course l am .
-Of course , these tests in no way pertain . . .

24:28.717 --> 24:32.178
. . .to the addictive properties
of Substance D , but to . . . .

24:32.388 --> 24:35.723
Well , let's start
with the set-ground test first.

24:36.225 --> 24:41.437
Within the apparently meaningless lines
is an object that we would all recognize .

24:41.522 --> 24:45.942
You are to tell me what that object is
and point to it in the total field .

24:46.152 --> 24:47.861
ln many of those taking Substance D . . .

24:48.070 --> 24:51.447
. . . a split between the right and the left
hemisphere of the brain occurs . . .

24:51.657 --> 24:55.577
. . .which results in a defect within both
the percept and cognitive systems.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.955
Although apparently the cognitive
continues to function normally .

24:59.165 --> 25:01.457
You located the familiar object
in this drawing?

25:01.876 --> 25:04.460
lt should just jump right out at you .

25:05.171 --> 25:07.755
l see a Coke bottle .

25:07.965 --> 25:10.884
A soda-pop bottle is correct.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.594
Was it in the speech l gave?

25:12.803 --> 25:16.347
Maybe it seemed l showed
a little bilateral dysfunction there .

25:16.473 --> 25:21.186
l mean , might have seemed
a little slushed .

25:21.395 --> 25:23.813
Are you getting any cross-chatter?

25:25.482 --> 25:29.861
-What?
-Cross-chatter between hemispheres.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.030
lf there's damage to
the left hemisphere . . .

25:32.239 --> 25:34.282
. . .where the linguistic skills
are located . . .

25:34.491 --> 25:38.369
. . .then sometimes the right hemisphere
will fill in to the best of its ability .

25:40.956 --> 25:43.499
l don't know.
l mean , not that l'm aware of.

25:43.584 --> 25:47.503
What do you see in this second picture?

25:51.926 --> 25:53.259
A sheep .

25:56.138 --> 25:57.722
Show me the sheep .

25:58.599 --> 26:00.892
An impairment of set-background
discrimination . . .

26:01.101 --> 26:03.519
. . .can get you into a heap of trouble .

26:03.604 --> 26:08.524
lnstead of perceiving no forms ,
you perceive faulty forms .

26:09.985 --> 26:12.237
So there is no sheep here , is there?

26:13.948 --> 26:15.240
Was l close?

26:15.449 --> 26:17.992
This is not a Rorschach test,
where some abstract blot. . .

26:18.202 --> 26:20.536
. . .can be interpreted many ways
by many subjects .

26:20.746 --> 26:22.747
This has one specific object.

26:22.957 --> 26:26.834
ln this case , a dog .

26:27.544 --> 26:29.420
A dog .

26:31.173 --> 26:33.549
What's that mean ,
that l saw a sheep instead?

26:33.592 --> 26:36.344
Who knows .
Only after the entire set has been run . . .

26:36.553 --> 26:39.472
- . . .can we determine--
-Why this is superior to the Rorschach . . .

26:39.556 --> 26:40.848
. . . is it's not interpretive .

26:41.058 --> 26:44.102
There are many wrongs ,
but there is only one right.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.687
You either get it or you don't.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.106
And if you show a run of not getting it. . .

26:48.315 --> 26:50.650
. . .then we have a fix on
a functional impairment. . .

26:50.859 --> 26:54.237
. . . and we dry you out for a while ,
until you test better later on .

26:55.322 --> 26:56.572
At New Path?

26:56.573 --> 26:58.574
-Undoubtedly .
-Undoubtedly .

26:58.575 --> 27:01.577
Now, what do you see in this drawing . . .

27:01.787 --> 27:05.498
. . . among these particular
black-and-white lines?

27:07.584 --> 27:09.252
Plastic dog shit.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.713
The little kind you can buy
and put in someone's bed .

27:12.589 --> 27:14.382
Can l go now?

27:15.217 --> 27:18.594
You know, Fred , if you keep
your sense of humor like you do . . .

27:18.595 --> 27:21.055
. . .you just might make it after all .

27:21.265 --> 27:23.933
Make it. Make what?

27:24.143 --> 27:25.810
The team? The girl?

27:26.020 --> 27:27.603
Make good? Make do?

27:27.646 --> 27:30.398
Make out? Make sense?
Make money? Make time?

27:30.607 --> 27:32.108
Define your terms .

27:32.318 --> 27:34.277
The Latin for "make" is facere . . .

27:34.486 --> 27:36.612
. . .which always reminds me of fuckere . . .

27:36.613 --> 27:39.615
. . .which is Latin for "to fuck."

27:39.658 --> 27:43.202
And l haven't been getting shit
in that department lately .

27:43.871 --> 27:45.997
lf you guys are psychologist-types . . .

27:46.206 --> 27:50.626
. . . and you've been monitoring
my endless debriefings with Hank, tell me:

27:51.086 --> 27:53.129
What the hell is Donna's deal?

27:53.339 --> 27:55.256
What do l do? l mean . . .

27:55.466 --> 27:59.635
. . . how do you make it with that kind of
sweet, unique , stubborn little chick?

28:00.262 --> 28:02.138
You could buy her flowers .

28:02.639 --> 28:04.057
Really?

28:04.266 --> 28:07.643
This time of year, you can get
little blue flowers at any nursery .

28:07.853 --> 28:09.812
Give them to her.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.198
Yeah .

28:22.159 --> 28:25.453
Hey , Fred , glad you could make it.

28:25.996 --> 28:31.334
This is the informant who phoned in about
Bob Arctor, and l mentioned him.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.044
-Yes .
-Anyway , he phoned in again . . .

28:33.253 --> 28:37.382
. . . and we challenged him to step forth
and identify himself.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.550
Do you know this man?

28:40.386 --> 28:42.095
Sure do .

28:42.679 --> 28:45.431
You're James Barris, aren't you?

28:46.350 --> 28:49.352
So , Mr. Barris, what's your information?

28:49.853 --> 28:54.399
l have evidence that Mr. Arctor is part of
a covert terrorist drug organization.

28:54.608 --> 28:58.319
They are well-funded and they have
arsenals of weapons at their disposal .

28:58.529 --> 28:59.946
And what is this organization?

29:00.823 --> 29:05.535
l believe it to be political in nature
and very much against this country .

29:05.702 --> 29:07.578
An enemy of the U . S .

29:07.704 --> 29:12.792
Can you give us any specific names of
anyone else in this organization . . .

29:13.001 --> 29:14.710
. . . persons Arctor meets with?

29:14.711 --> 29:16.629
Yes. Miss Donna Hawthorne .

29:16.713 --> 29:20.633
On a variety of pretexts,
he will go over to her place of residence . . .

29:20.717 --> 29:24.137
. . . and colludes with her regularly ,
l've noticed .

29:24.346 --> 29:25.721
Colludes.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.141
-Colludes.
-What do you mean?

29:28.350 --> 29:31.561
Well , l've followed him in my own car
without his knowledge .

29:31.728 --> 29:33.729
-He goes there often .
-Yes , as often as--

29:33.939 --> 29:36.357
-She is his girl .
-Right.

29:36.567 --> 29:39.318
-Mr. Arctor also seemingly--
-Hold up , hold up .

29:39.736 --> 29:41.654
You think there's anything to this, Fred?

29:42.322 --> 29:45.491
l think we should definitely
look at his evidence .

29:45.701 --> 29:47.660
All right. Bring in your evidence .

29:47.828 --> 29:50.496
All of it. We want names most of all .

29:50.706 --> 29:54.250
Now, have you seen
Mr. Arctor involved . . .

29:54.460 --> 29:57.628
. . . in any large quantities of drugs?

29:57.754 --> 30:00.089
To be certain .
And l have carefully taken samples--

30:00.757 --> 30:02.008
Again , without his knowledge .

30:02.217 --> 30:05.470
--when the opportunity presented itself,
strictly for you to analyze .

30:05.679 --> 30:07.722
-l can bring those in as well .
-Great.

30:08.557 --> 30:11.642
ls there anything else
you wish to state at this time?

30:11.768 --> 30:16.731
There is. Mr. Arctor is an addict.
He is addicted to Substance D .

30:16.773 --> 30:19.650
And l fear that his mind has become
deranged over time . . .

30:19.776 --> 30:25.448
. . . and he is now officially
to be considered dangerous .

30:25.824 --> 30:27.783
-Dangerous .
-Yes . He is having episodes . . .

30:27.910 --> 30:30.870
. . .that would occur with
brain damage from Substance D .

30:31.079 --> 30:34.832
And l'm quite certain , also , that the optic
chiasm has deteriorated somewhat. . .

30:35.042 --> 30:37.502
. . .due to a weak ipsilateral component.

30:37.711 --> 30:41.589
This sort of unsupported speculation ,
as l've already warned you, Mr. Barris. . .

30:41.798 --> 30:43.841
. . . is completely worthless .

30:44.051 --> 30:48.721
Now, we'll be sending an officer with you
to gather your evidence .

30:48.805 --> 30:50.806
-All right?
-May l--?

30:50.891 --> 30:53.017
An officer out of uniform , of course .

30:53.560 --> 30:56.395
No , see , l could be murdered .

30:56.605 --> 31:00.816
As l've already said ,
Mr. Arctor has this cache of weapons.

31:00.984 --> 31:05.821
Mr. Barris, we appreciate this
and the extreme risk you are taking .

31:06.240 --> 31:11.536
And if it works out, and your information
is valuable in obtaining a conviction . . .

31:11.745 --> 31:14.330
- . . .then naturally--
-But that is not the reason l'm here .

31:14.540 --> 31:16.832
You see , this man is--
He just has a soul sickness .

31:16.917 --> 31:21.629
His brain is damaged from the use of
this toxic and most terrible substance .

31:21.838 --> 31:26.759
Nonetheless , the reason l am here is
l feel that l may have certain qualities. . .

31:26.843 --> 31:30.263
. . .that would qualify me
to perhaps come over to your side .

31:30.472 --> 31:32.932
To surrender and come to
the side of law enforcement.

31:33.141 --> 31:36.852
-l would like an employment application .
-We don't care why you're here.

31:36.979 --> 31:41.857
We only care whether your evidence and
material amount to anything .

31:41.942 --> 31:44.193
The rest is your problem .

31:49.866 --> 31:53.869
Perhaps at the desk
l can get an employment. . . .

31:55.497 --> 31:56.872
You are about to witness . . .

31:56.915 --> 32:01.335
. . .for approximately 6 1 cents of
ordinary household materials . . .

32:01.545 --> 32:04.380
. . .the perfect homemade silencer.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.591
Barris , the neighbors are gonna hear.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.010
No , they only call in murders
in this neighborhood .

32:09.219 --> 32:12.972
Plus, Freckledeck, it's a silencer.
They're not gonna hear anything .

32:13.181 --> 32:16.892
Well , l'm pretty fucking sure
they're illegal .

32:18.645 --> 32:22.648
ln this day and age , the type of society
we find ourselves living in . . .

32:22.858 --> 32:23.899
. . .every person of worth . . .

32:24.109 --> 32:27.069
. . . needs to have a gun at all times ,
to protect themselves .

32:27.279 --> 32:28.821
And we're off.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.920
That sure is some silencer.

32:45.130 --> 32:49.967
Yes. What it did was augment the sound ,
rather than dampen it.

32:50.177 --> 32:53.054
But l almost have it.
l believe l have it in principle , anyway .

32:53.263 --> 32:56.390
Oh , well , the good news is,
regardless of what you do next time . . .

32:56.600 --> 33:00.353
. . . it'll be a silencer to us ,
because we're now deaf!

33:14.284 --> 33:16.202
<i>What happened?</i>

33:19.539 --> 33:21.624
<i>How'd l get here?</i>

33:29.716 --> 33:32.510
Okay , it's your move now.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.101
Anyone want some popcorn?

33:40.310 --> 33:41.769
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

33:53.990 --> 33:55.741
Fuck !

34:02.416 --> 34:04.125
<i>The pain . . .</i>

34:04.793 --> 34:06.293
<i>. . . so unexpected and undeserved . . .</i>

34:06.503 --> 34:09.672
<i>. . . had , for some reason ,</i>
<i>cleared away the cobwebs.</i>

34:11.091 --> 34:14.009
<i>l realized l didn't hate the cabinet door.</i>

34:14.094 --> 34:19.014
<i>l hated my life , my house , my family . . .</i>

34:19.099 --> 34:21.434
-Are you okay , Daddy?
-What happened?

34:21.643 --> 34:23.811
<i>. . . my backyard . . .</i>

34:24.521 --> 34:27.022
<i>. . . my power mower.</i>

34:28.024 --> 34:30.275
<i>Nothing would ever change .</i>

34:30.485 --> 34:34.029
<i>Nothing new could ever be expected .</i>

34:34.281 --> 34:38.492
<i>lt had to end , and it did .</i>

34:40.704 --> 34:43.664
<i>Now in the dark world where l dwell . . .</i>

34:43.873 --> 34:49.503
<i>. . . ugly things and surprising things</i>
<i>and sometimes little wondrous things. . .</i>

34:49.713 --> 34:52.630
<i>. . . spill out at me constantly . . .</i>

34:53.717 --> 34:56.051
<i>. . . and l can count on nothing .</i>

35:12.068 --> 35:13.152
Medfly , got it.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.072
-That would be a Thelma Kornford .
-Oh , yeah , Miss Big-Tits.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.824
lf l had known it was harmless . . .

35:19.034 --> 35:22.077
- . . . l would have killed it myself.
-l would have killed it myself.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.121
Thanks for the mammaries.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.126
She had such beautiful . . . .

35:30.003 --> 35:31.003
Daddy slowpoke .

35:31.254 --> 35:34.215
-Oh , get around him , will you?
-You know what to do . Your move .

35:34.424 --> 35:36.425
That's a big ten-four.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.093
Got nothing on us.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.639
-There we go .
-Get a life!

35:41.848 --> 35:43.098
Okay , Bob , no rush .

35:43.308 --> 35:44.975
-Not so fast.
-You are flying .

35:45.101 --> 35:46.894
Decelerate .

35:47.979 --> 35:49.104
Steady .

35:49.231 --> 35:50.856
-Decelerate .
-Slow down .

35:52.108 --> 35:54.026
-Jesus .
-Son of a bitch .

35:55.445 --> 35:57.988
Come on . Decelerate!

36:08.124 --> 36:09.124
Let us over.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.126
lt's an emergency .

36:11.211 --> 36:14.088
We're getting over. Emergency .

36:19.177 --> 36:21.428
-What the hell was that?
-Jesus fucking Christ.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.681
What the hell in the hootenanny
was that?

36:24.266 --> 36:27.184
The return spring
on the throttle cable , or. . . .

36:27.394 --> 36:28.769
Look, the gas .

36:29.145 --> 36:30.563
Was it cut or broken?

36:30.772 --> 36:32.189
Let's give her a look.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.783
Oh , my . . . .

36:48.164 --> 36:52.668
lt's not the spring . lt's the linkage
from the pedal to the carb . See?

36:52.878 --> 36:57.715
lt fell apart, so the gas pedal didn't push
back out when you took your foot off. . .

36:57.924 --> 37:01.176
- . . . but doesn't explain why--
-There is a safety override on the carb .

37:01.386 --> 37:04.138
-When the linkage parts , it's--
-Why'd it part?

37:05.098 --> 37:09.602
Shouldn't this ring hold the cable in place?
l mean , how could it just come off like that?

37:09.811 --> 37:11.770
Let's have a look. Let's probe a little .

37:12.188 --> 37:16.483
All right. This screw has been turned
all the way out, the idle screw.

37:16.818 --> 37:20.279
So when the linkage parted ,
it went the other way . Up instead of down .

37:21.197 --> 37:23.741
Wait. Now, how could that happen?

37:24.117 --> 37:26.035
There is no way that that screw. . .

37:26.202 --> 37:29.204
. . .could turn itself all the way out
like that accidentally .

37:29.247 --> 37:30.456
No way .

37:32.208 --> 37:35.419
Motherfucker! They did it deliberately!

37:36.713 --> 37:40.883
We almost died !
They almost fucking got us, man !

37:41.092 --> 37:43.052
To loosen the lock ring
and nut assembly . . .

37:43.219 --> 37:45.220
. . .that holds the linkage rods together. . .

37:45.221 --> 37:47.973
. . . a special tool would be needed .
Several , in fact.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.267
lt'll take half an hour
to get this back together.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.853
-l have the tools , though .
-Back at the house .

37:54.564 --> 37:57.650
Correct. We can always go to
a repair center and borrow theirs . . .

37:57.859 --> 38:00.235
. . .or get a tow truck out here .

38:09.579 --> 38:11.038
Here .

38:13.249 --> 38:18.253
You know, maybe that's what's
fucking us up , fucking up our brains .

38:18.755 --> 38:22.257
-We're gonna wind up like Freck soon .
-No .

38:22.926 --> 38:25.177
Okay , these are for us.

38:25.387 --> 38:29.223
And l'm going to suggest that you take
several , with the implicit acceptance . . .

38:29.265 --> 38:32.267
. . .of the fact that Substance D
cannot screw up an accelerator. . .

38:32.352 --> 38:36.271
- . . .or a carb-idle adjustment.
-Yeah , dude . Don't blame the drugs.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.109
-Come on .
-Well , so much for. . .

38:40.276 --> 38:42.861
. . .our great road trip to San Diego , Bob .

38:43.071 --> 38:45.864
l told you we should have gone
to San F rancisco .

38:46.074 --> 38:50.119
What, like going to San Francisco would not
have caused this problem with the engine?

38:50.286 --> 38:53.288
Yeah , because when you're going north ,
it screws this way .

38:53.289 --> 38:55.290
When you're going south ,
it screws that way .

38:55.458 --> 38:57.001
lf we were in Australia.

39:05.844 --> 39:09.263
This proves you got somebody
out to get you real bad , Bob .

39:09.305 --> 39:11.974
l just hope the house is still there
when we get back.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.475
Yeah , l didn't think of that.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.437
-l wouldn't worry about it too much .
-You wouldn't?

39:16.646 --> 39:20.190
Christ, they may have broken in
and ripped off all we got.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.943
All Bob's got, anyhow.

39:23.153 --> 39:25.446
What if they stomped the animals?

39:25.655 --> 39:29.366
Don't worry about it.
l left a little surprise for them .

39:30.243 --> 39:31.326
What?

39:31.494 --> 39:36.081
Yes , anyone entering the house while we
were gone today will receive a little surprise .

39:36.291 --> 39:38.375
Little something l perfected
early this morning .

39:38.585 --> 39:40.461
What kind of surprise?
lt's my house , Jim .

39:40.670 --> 39:44.339
You should ask me before
you start wiring up my house .

39:44.340 --> 39:47.176
Why so uptight about
protecting your house from intruders?

39:47.343 --> 39:48.552
Why would you care?

39:48.762 --> 39:50.763
l'm just saying , it's my house , that's all .

39:50.972 --> 39:54.266
You can't start going around
booby-trapping my house .

39:54.350 --> 39:57.603
Okay , okay . l mean , jeez.
Or as the Germans say , leise . . .

39:57.812 --> 40:00.397
. . .which translates to "be cool ."
Just be cool .

40:01.232 --> 40:02.357
So , what did you do?

40:02.567 --> 40:05.861
lf the front door is opened
while we are in absentia. . .

40:06.071 --> 40:09.156
. . .thumbnail-sized , auxiliary ,
motion-detector. . .

40:09.365 --> 40:11.408
. . .digital-memory cameras start recording .

40:11.826 --> 40:13.702
You should have told me .

40:14.245 --> 40:17.372
What if they come in through the back door
or the bathroom window. . .

40:17.373 --> 40:19.333
. . . like that infamous Beatles' song?

40:19.375 --> 40:22.169
To increase their chances of entering
via the front door. . .

40:22.378 --> 40:25.214
. . . rather than in other less usual places . . .

40:25.381 --> 40:27.758
. . . l , fortuitously ,
left the front door unlocked .

40:27.967 --> 40:31.887
-Suppose they don't know it's unlocked .
-That's why l left a note on the door.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.349
-You're kidding me .
-No , no . No .

40:35.391 --> 40:38.435
Yes. But no . But yes.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.604
Are you bullshitting us or not?

40:40.814 --> 40:43.148
l just simply never know with you .

40:43.358 --> 40:46.401
-ls he fucking with us, Bob?
-We'll see when we get back.

40:46.444 --> 40:50.614
lf there's a note on the door and it's
unlocked , we'll know he isn't lying .

40:50.824 --> 40:55.327
They'd probably take the note down after
ripping off and vandalizing the house . . .

40:55.411 --> 40:57.871
. . . and locking the door behind them ,
so we don't know.

40:58.081 --> 41:01.166
We will never know.
lt's still that gray area.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.836
Of course l'm kidding .
Only a psychotic would do that.

41:04.045 --> 41:06.338
Leave the front door
unlocked with a note on it.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.965
What'd you write
on the note , Jim?

41:08.174 --> 41:11.301
l wrote , "Come on in ,
the door's unlocked ."

41:11.636 --> 41:13.846
He did it. He really did it.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.974
This is the only way we'll know
for sure who's been doing this .

41:17.183 --> 41:19.518
And is that not what is
of primary importance?

41:19.727 --> 41:23.689
Okay , l'm still gray here .
Now, did you do it or not?

41:23.898 --> 41:25.858
ls it really that suspenseful?

41:26.067 --> 41:28.068
-Did you?
-He did it.

41:28.278 --> 41:29.945
Doesn't matter.
We'll be home shortly .

41:30.155 --> 41:32.322
-Did you?
-We'll be home presently .

42:17.702 --> 42:21.079
Well , Barris, l can see you're right.

42:21.289 --> 42:25.792
This scrupulous covering-over of
all the signs they would've otherwise left. . .

42:26.002 --> 42:29.213
. . .testifies to their thoroughness .

42:29.422 --> 42:30.797
You're an idiot.

42:32.133 --> 42:36.011
Oh , wait, wait. This-- What's that?

42:37.931 --> 42:40.515
Come here , come here .
Look at this , look at this .

42:40.725 --> 42:44.353
A still-hot cigarette butt. lt sure is .
Wait a second .

42:44.520 --> 42:46.813
They lit a joint
while they were here , Bob .

42:47.023 --> 42:49.608
Fuck it. Barris is right,
there was somebody here .

42:49.817 --> 42:51.526
This roach is still hot, smell it.

42:51.611 --> 42:55.447
Yes . And that roach may not have
been left here by accident.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.366
This evidence may not be a slip-up .

42:59.202 --> 43:01.620
-So , what now?
-Maybe they were here specifically . . .

43:01.829 --> 43:03.538
. . .to plant drugs in the house .

43:03.748 --> 43:06.250
Setting us up ,
then "phoning in a tip" later.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.543
lt could be in the phone ,
the wall outlets .

43:08.544 --> 43:11.546
We have to go through this house
and get it absolutely clean . . .

43:11.673 --> 43:14.216
. . . before they phone us in ,
unless they already have .

43:14.676 --> 43:15.968
We might only have minutes .

43:17.553 --> 43:18.720
You check the wall sockets .

43:18.930 --> 43:20.931
-l'll tear this phone apart.
-Wait, hold on .

43:21.140 --> 43:23.850
-lf they see us scrambling before the raid--
-What raid?

43:24.060 --> 43:26.478
lf we're frantically
trying to flush their drugs . . .

43:26.562 --> 43:29.564
. . .we can't allege , though true ,
we didn't know they were here .

43:29.565 --> 43:35.279
They're going to find us holding them ,
or maybe that's part of the plan .

43:35.697 --> 43:38.615
Shit, shit, shit.

43:38.825 --> 43:43.078
We can't do anything .
We're fucked , man . Fuck.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.622
-Fucked , man !
-Barris . . .

43:45.832 --> 43:48.333
. . .what about the super-secret
surveillance cameras?

43:48.543 --> 43:51.545
-The what?
-The doodads, man .

43:51.587 --> 43:55.173
Oh , yes, of course . Right, of course .
How could l have forgotten?

43:55.717 --> 43:58.427
This should be extremely informational
at this point.

43:58.594 --> 44:03.348
l believe this will tell us a great deal .

44:08.229 --> 44:13.150
Although it probably wouldn't have
proven to be that important.

44:13.609 --> 44:16.570
Let me guess: didn't record .

44:17.905 --> 44:22.784
Allow me to suggest that it's highly likely
that the tow truck was bugged. . .

44:22.994 --> 44:28.498
. . .thus affording them ample time and
opportunity to deploy an operative. . .

44:28.624 --> 44:32.044
. . .to diffuse and otherwise erase
the evidence obtained .

44:32.837 --> 44:35.839
But we have no other recourse ,
in view of their evasive tactics .

44:36.049 --> 44:40.052
l mean , there is , of course , one thing you
could do , Bob , although it would take time .

44:42.722 --> 44:45.349
Sell the house and move out?

44:46.809 --> 44:49.644
But hell , this is our home .

44:49.771 --> 44:51.063
You could make a profit.

44:51.272 --> 44:54.649
On the other hand , you might have to
take a loss on a quick sale .

44:55.318 --> 44:56.651
l know a good realtor.

44:57.403 --> 45:00.113
What reason should l give for selling?
They always ask.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.949
Can't tell the truth .
You shouldn't tell the truth--

45:03.159 --> 45:04.993
Why can't we tell the truth?

45:05.203 --> 45:07.662
We put an ad in the L.A. Times.

45:07.872 --> 45:09.790
Modern , three-bedroom tract house . . .

45:09.999 --> 45:12.667
. . .with two bathrooms
for easy and fast flushing . . .

45:12.668 --> 45:16.671
. . . high-grade drugs stashed throughout
all rooms , included in sale price .

45:16.881 --> 45:19.549
lt could actually increase the value .

45:19.675 --> 45:22.594
But they might call and ask
what kind of drugs are stashed . . .

45:22.678 --> 45:24.679
. . . and we don't know,
it could be anything .

45:24.806 --> 45:27.307
Prospective buyers might inquire
as to the quantity .

45:27.517 --> 45:29.017
And we don't know at this point.

45:29.227 --> 45:33.647
lt could be ounces of weed or pounds of
heroin , or hits of E or killer caps of D .

45:33.689 --> 45:35.774
Hey , you guys .

45:35.983 --> 45:38.568
Fuck ! Jesus .

45:39.695 --> 45:41.780
What the fuck is wrong with you?

45:44.033 --> 45:46.701
l came in , like the note said .

45:46.744 --> 45:50.205
lt didn't say when
you were gonna get back, so l just. . . .

45:50.623 --> 45:55.377
l just sat around for a while
and ended up crashing .

45:55.586 --> 45:58.338
-Love your sweater.
-Just-- Don't touch me .

45:58.881 --> 46:01.425
Man , you guys were
making so much noise .

46:01.634 --> 46:03.969
-Sorry .
-lt woke me up .

46:05.847 --> 46:08.723
Did you smoke a joint
before you crashed?

46:09.559 --> 46:10.725
Yeah .

46:11.727 --> 46:14.312
Otherwise , l can't ever sleep .

46:15.731 --> 46:18.150
You know,
you guys should seriously think about. . .

46:18.359 --> 46:21.153
. . . maybe locking the doors
when you leave .

46:21.612 --> 46:25.282
Otherwise you could get ripped off
and it'd be your own fault.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.659
This is all your fault.

46:27.743 --> 46:31.746
Did l hear you say
you were gonna sell the house?

46:31.956 --> 46:35.333
Or was that, you know, me dreaming?

46:35.543 --> 46:37.752
Because what l heard sounded weird .

46:38.838 --> 46:40.130
Yeah , we're all dreaming .

46:40.339 --> 46:42.507
Quiet. Steady . Steady .

46:42.717 --> 46:45.051
Kidney . Kidney . Kidney .

46:45.761 --> 46:49.222
So the information from the holo scanners
installed in Arctor's house . . .

46:49.432 --> 46:54.144
. . . are transmitted back here ,
to station 1 2-879 .

46:55.062 --> 46:58.690
This'll be your new
home away from home , pal .

46:58.900 --> 47:01.693
lt's pretty intuitive .

47:01.777 --> 47:06.781
You'll just be watching and
scanning through recorded information .

47:06.991 --> 47:11.453
You can go live , of course ,
but that tends to be excruciatingly boring .

47:11.662 --> 47:14.789
And then , you see
where these holos are placed?

47:14.790 --> 47:19.169
What would be great is if they ever
need servicing or changing out. . .

47:19.378 --> 47:22.005
. . .you could do that yourself
while no one else is around .

47:22.215 --> 47:25.050
But wouldn't you then see me
on the tapes doing that?

47:25.259 --> 47:27.802
No . For that, you just edit yourself out.

47:27.845 --> 47:31.223
But be sure to include yourself in the tapes
from time to time . . .

47:31.432 --> 47:33.850
. . . because if you systematically
edit yourself out. . .

47:34.060 --> 47:37.103
. . .we can deduce who you are through
the process of elimination . . .

47:37.313 --> 47:38.939
. . .whether we want to or not.

47:40.816 --> 47:42.567
l'm not sure l exactly--

47:42.777 --> 47:45.529
We take it for granted that you are
one of the individuals . . .

47:45.738 --> 47:50.784
. . .that are in Arctor's circle of roommates
and friends that frequent the house .

47:50.826 --> 47:54.829
l mean , undoubtedly , you're either
Jim Barris or Ernie Luckman . . .

47:55.581 --> 47:56.957
. . . Charles F reck. . .

47:57.708 --> 47:59.251
. . .even Arctor himself.

47:59.919 --> 48:01.836
Hell , you could be Donna,
for all l know.

48:02.046 --> 48:05.465
As my superior,
l figure you'd know all this stuff.

48:05.675 --> 48:06.841
How the hell would l know?

48:06.926 --> 48:09.469
l'm just a little guy behind a big desk.

48:09.679 --> 48:13.974
You'd have to go way up the food chain
to access that kind of info .

48:14.183 --> 48:16.893
You know, instead of me
doing any maintenance . . .

48:17.103 --> 48:19.854
. . . send someone to the house
once a month , in uniform . . .

48:19.897 --> 48:22.357
. . . and have him say , "Good morning .

48:22.567 --> 48:28.154
l'm here to service the monitoring devices
covertly installed on your premises ."

48:29.198 --> 48:32.867
Maybe that sucker Arctor
would even pick up the bill .

48:33.286 --> 48:37.872
Actually , l think Arctor would probably
kill the guy and then disappear.

48:38.874 --> 48:41.876
lf it's proven that Arctor is ,
in fact, hiding that much .

48:42.587 --> 48:45.839
Believe me , Arctor is hiding a great deal .

48:45.881 --> 48:48.425
We've got more recent
information on him analyzed . . .

48:48.634 --> 48:52.887
. . . and there's no doubt about it,
he's a ringer.

48:52.930 --> 48:56.308
A three-dollar bill . The guy is a phony .

48:56.726 --> 48:58.351
So keep on him until he drops. . .

48:58.561 --> 49:01.563
. . . until we have enough to arrest him
and make it stick.

49:01.897 --> 49:06.443
You think he's high up in the ,
you know, Substance D network?

49:06.652 --> 49:09.529
What we think is of
no importance to your work.

49:09.739 --> 49:14.159
You report your limited conclusions ,
and we evaluate .

49:14.368 --> 49:16.911
-You got it?
-Okay , okay .

49:16.996 --> 49:18.788
l got it.

49:21.375 --> 49:24.919
l'd say Arctor is doomed
if he's up to something .

49:25.838 --> 49:30.842
And l have a hunch ,
from what you're saying , that he is .

49:34.055 --> 49:37.682
The idling jets could be replaced with
smaller jets that would compensate .

49:37.892 --> 49:41.603
And with a tach , he could just watch
his rpms so it didn't over-rev .

49:41.812 --> 49:44.064
Usually just backing off
on the gas pedal . . .

49:44.273 --> 49:46.941
. . .causes it to upshift
if the automatic linkage doesn't.

49:47.151 --> 49:49.235
What are you grease monkeys up to?

49:49.820 --> 49:50.987
Bob's got a bent choke shaft.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.783
-How much does this lmpala weigh?
-Weighs about 1 000 pounds .

49:54.950 --> 49:58.244
Thousand pounds traveling at
80 miles per hour builds up a force of--

49:58.454 --> 50:01.456
That's 1 000 pounds with passengers in it
and a full tank of gas .

50:01.666 --> 50:04.042
-For a fact? Okay .
-How many passengers?

50:04.251 --> 50:06.836
-Twelve .
-Six in the front, six in the back.

50:06.962 --> 50:10.090
No , that's 1 1 in the back
and the driver sitting alone in the front.

50:10.299 --> 50:13.009
Extra weight on the rear wheels
is to keep from fishtailing .

50:13.219 --> 50:16.179
-We talking about 1 2 50-pound passengers?
-Kids' soccer team .

50:16.389 --> 50:18.431
Now, is that metal or plastic cleats?

50:18.641 --> 50:21.893
-Metal cleats for safety .
-Okay , my computations are complete .

50:21.977 --> 50:25.939
You are just heckle tweak,
but you are bug-bite squared .

50:25.981 --> 50:28.942
-What kind of bug?
-About-to-get-fucked-up-bitch beetle .

50:29.193 --> 50:31.194
-Hey , come on . Cool it, you guys.
-Tell me--

50:31.404 --> 50:35.448
Step back. Freck-and-frack,
Ernie's on the attack.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.200
-What is this?
-Come on .

50:37.410 --> 50:40.036
-l'm desperately afraid .
-l'm gonna knock your nads . . .

50:40.246 --> 50:43.164
. . . up into your nostrils
for talking to your betters that way .

50:43.374 --> 50:45.750
All right.
l'm a technician , you're an interloper.

50:45.960 --> 50:49.045
You are constitutionally incapable
of not shutting the fuck up .

50:49.505 --> 50:50.880
-Bring it!
-Shut the fuck up!

50:51.006 --> 50:53.091
No , no , proctology boy ,
l'm coming after you .

50:53.300 --> 50:55.093
Shut it. Hey . Hey .

50:55.302 --> 50:58.304
l have the perfect tool for this job .

51:02.977 --> 51:05.145
-l was only kidding him .
-Fuck.

51:05.688 --> 51:07.021
Fuck !

51:07.857 --> 51:10.984
What if he goes in there
and he gets his gun and his silencer?

51:11.026 --> 51:13.903
l'm leaving .
This place has become unsafe .

51:14.780 --> 51:18.450
No , hey , hey , Freck. No , come on .
You're a bro , man . Stick around .

51:22.329 --> 51:24.497
What's the hammer for, Barris?

51:24.707 --> 51:28.585
No , l just saw it inside and thought l ,
you know, should bring it along with me .

51:31.881 --> 51:34.132
-Same with this.
-You ready?

51:34.341 --> 51:35.967
Yeah , what do you want?

51:36.051 --> 51:37.469
-Come on , hammerhead .
-Shut up .

51:37.678 --> 51:39.053
-Make a move .
-Don't like it.

51:39.263 --> 51:43.057
Okay . lf you guys are gonna kill each other,
l'm splitting .

51:43.058 --> 51:45.894
-lt's getting very fucked up over here .
-Hey , Freck.

51:46.061 --> 51:49.481
The most dangerous kind of person
is the one who's afraid of his own shadow.

51:50.065 --> 51:52.275
-What is that supposed to mean?
-l'll tell you .

51:52.485 --> 51:54.944
lt means that if you take
too much of that stuff. . .

51:55.070 --> 51:57.071
. . .you not only start seeing
bugs all over. . .

51:57.156 --> 52:00.074
. . . but you start talking like . . . and
no one can understand you .

52:00.159 --> 52:02.494
What'd you say , Barris?
l didn't understand .

52:04.079 --> 52:05.538
See , you guys are fucked up .

52:05.748 --> 52:08.750
No , no , it is y-uck-uck-ou
that are fuck-ucked-ed up .

52:08.959 --> 52:11.085
Hey , go Freck yourself.

52:11.170 --> 52:13.338
Don't take the car, you'll kill yourself.

52:22.598 --> 52:27.435
So this guy's been going around claiming
to be a world-famous impostor, right?

52:27.645 --> 52:32.106
Says he's posed , at one time or another,
as a surgeon at John Hopkins . . .

52:32.316 --> 52:34.984
. . . as a theoretical ,
submolecular, high-velocity . . .

52:35.110 --> 52:38.446
. . . particle-research physicist
on a federal grant at Harvard . . .

52:38.864 --> 52:42.867
. . . as a Finnish novelist
who won the Nobel Prize for literature . . .

52:43.077 --> 52:45.119
. . . as a deposed Argentinean president. . .

52:45.287 --> 52:48.122
. . .who was married to a go-go dancer
from Chicago--

52:48.207 --> 52:50.124
He got away with all that?

52:50.793 --> 52:53.336
-He never got caught?
-Okay , you broke my flow. . .

52:53.546 --> 52:56.172
. . . so now l guess l'll just have
to segue down to the near.

52:56.382 --> 52:59.092
That's just it.
You see , he didn't pose as any of those .

52:59.134 --> 53:03.137
He just posed as
a world-famous impostor. Yeah .

53:03.138 --> 53:05.014
lt came out later in the L.A. Times.

53:05.140 --> 53:08.893
They checked up , and he was pushing
a broom at Disneyland or something.

53:09.103 --> 53:10.687
He saw that old DiCaprio movie .

53:10.896 --> 53:14.190
You know, the one where
he plays a world-famous impostor. . .

53:14.400 --> 53:16.359
. . . before Leonardo hit his Elvis stage .

53:16.569 --> 53:17.861
And his first thought was:

53:18.070 --> 53:21.698
"Hey , l could pose as all those exotic guys
and get away with it."

53:21.907 --> 53:24.242
But then , his next thought was ,
"Hell , why bother?

53:24.451 --> 53:28.997
l could just pose as an impostor,
and it'd be a lot easier."

53:29.164 --> 53:32.417
They say that he made more money
than the actual impostor. . .

53:32.626 --> 53:37.672
<i>. . . although l'm not sure</i>
<i>if they'd adjust for inflation .</i>

53:38.757 --> 53:41.175
<i>Well , you know,</i>
<i>we all see impostors now and then . . .</i>

53:41.218 --> 53:44.178
<i>. . . but not posing</i>
<i>as subatomic physicists.</i>

53:45.180 --> 53:47.098
<i>Oh , as a narc, you mean .</i>

53:47.182 --> 53:48.850
<i>What's a narc look like?</i>

53:49.059 --> 53:52.186
<i>That's like asking,</i>
<i>"What's an impostor look like? "</i>

53:52.438 --> 53:54.314
<i>l talked to this dealer</i>
<i>who'd been busted .</i>

53:54.523 --> 53:57.191
<i>l asked him what the narc</i>
<i>who busted him looked like .</i>

53:57.401 --> 53:59.736
<i>What did he say, he looked just like us?</i>

54:00.863 --> 54:02.572
<i>More so .</i>

54:02.781 --> 54:05.199
<i>So l guess the moral of that is. . .</i>

54:06.201 --> 54:09.203
<i>. . . stay away from guys</i>
<i>looking the same as us.</i>

54:12.625 --> 54:14.500
<i>Well , there are female narcs.</i>

54:14.710 --> 54:16.753
<i>Oh , hey, l'd like to meet one of those .</i>

54:17.212 --> 54:20.840
<i>No , l don't mean a female . l mean</i>
<i>just the narc, knowingly, like , positive .</i>

54:21.050 --> 54:24.886
<i>Sure . So you could positively know .</i>
<i>And you will .</i>

54:25.095 --> 54:28.306
<i>When he slaps the cuffs on ,</i>
<i>you'll know for sure , when that day comes.</i>

54:28.515 --> 54:30.266
<i>How could a guy do that?</i>

54:30.476 --> 54:32.101
<i>Pose as a narc?</i>

54:32.603 --> 54:34.020
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

54:34.813 --> 54:36.606
<i>Pose as a narc?</i>

54:36.815 --> 54:39.817
<i>-No, you said it. So yeah .</i>
<i>-Pose as a narc .</i>

54:40.694 --> 54:45.073
<i>Oh , sh-- Shit, l'm spaced .</i>

54:45.240 --> 54:47.075
<i>Pose as a narc, wow .</i>

54:47.826 --> 54:50.244
<i>Pose as a narc .</i>

54:52.247 --> 54:54.582
<i>My brains are scrambled today .</i>

56:16.665 --> 56:18.332
Christ, Barris, what the fuck?

56:35.893 --> 56:37.643
<i>Yes, hi . How are you?</i>

56:37.853 --> 56:40.354
<i>l have something</i>
<i>somewhat emergent to report.</i>

56:42.024 --> 56:44.734
<i>l don't know if l should be summoning</i>
<i>the inhalator squad . . .</i>

56:44.943 --> 56:47.153
<i>. . .or the resuscitation squad .</i>

56:47.946 --> 56:49.238
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

56:49.364 --> 56:52.158

<i>And yet, you've managed</i>

58:47.149 --> 58:49.609
<i>There was no problem</i>
<i>in the circles where he hung out. . .</i>

58:49.818 --> 58:51.485
<i>. . . in putting an end to yourself.</i>

58:51.486 --> 58:55.114
<i>You just bought a large quantity of downers</i>
<i>and took them with cheap wine .</i>

58:55.699 --> 58:57.992
<i>The planning part had to do</i>
<i>with the artifacts. . .</i>

58:58.202 --> 59:01.204
<i>. . . he wanted found on him</i>
<i>by later archeologists.</i>

59:01.538 --> 59:03.497
<i>He had spent several days deciding . . .</i>

59:03.582 --> 59:07.460
<i>. . . much longer than he had spent</i>
<i>deciding to kill himself.</i>

59:07.502 --> 59:09.795
<i>He would be found lying on his back</i>
<i>on his bed . . .</i>

59:10.005 --> 59:12.506
<i>. . .with a copy of Ayn Rand's</i>
The Fountainhead. . .

59:12.507 --> 59:14.508
<i>. . . and an unfinished letter to Exxon . . .</i>

59:14.551 --> 59:17.845
<i>. . . protesting the cancellation</i>
<i>of his gas credit card .</i>

59:18.055 --> 59:21.515
<i>That way, he would indict the system</i>

59:21.558 --> 59:24.602
<i>. . .oVer and aboVe</i>
<i>what the death itself achieVed .</i>

59:25.145 --> 59:28.105
<i>At the last moment,</i>
<i>he changed his mind on a decisive issue . . .</i>

59:28.315 --> 59:31.192
<i>. . . and decided to drink the pills</i>
<i>with a connoisseur wine . . .</i>

59:31.401 --> 59:33.486
<i>. . . instead of Ripple or Thunderbird .</i>

59:33.528 --> 59:36.530
<i>So he set off on one last drive ,</i>
<i>over to Tiny's Liquors. . .</i>

59:36.740 --> 59:38.532
<i>. . .which specialized in fine wines. . .</i>

59:38.617 --> 59:41.535
<i>. . . and bought a bottle</i>
<i>of 2001 Azalea Springs Merlot. . .</i>

59:41.745 --> 59:43.579
<i>. . .which set him back almost $70 .</i>

59:46.541 --> 59:50.836
<i>Back home again , he uncorked the wine ,</i>
<i>let it breathe , drank a few glasses of it. . .</i>

59:51.046 --> 59:53.798
<i>. . . and tried to think</i>
<i>of something meaningful , but could not.</i>

59:54.007 --> 59:57.802
<i>And then , with a glass of merlot,</i>
<i>gulped down all the pills at once .</i>

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.431
<i>However, he had been burned .</i>

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:07.895
<i>lnstead of quietly suffocating,</i>
<i>Charles Freck began to hallucinate .</i>

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:10.856
<i>The next thing he knew,</i>
<i>a creature from between dimensions. . .</i>

<i>. . .was standing beside his bed ,</i>
<i>looking down at him disapprovingly .</i>

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.114
You're gonna read me my sins?

lt's gonna take 1 00 , 000 hours?

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:29.417
Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly ,
in shifts , throughout eternity .

The list will never end .

"Age 6 , in the first grade:

Kicking the dog .

Where did Substance D come from?

Why can't we stop it?

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:18.549
The bigger this war gets,
the more freedoms we lose . . .

Look around you .
Look how far we've come .

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:28.559
Humanity wasn't meant to live like this .

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:32.646
Our every waking moment
tracked and traced and scanned .

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.774
lt's time to stop
submitting to this tyranny .

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:37.818
lt's time to realize
that we're being enslaved .

Protect us from ourselves .

Hey , guys , l used to be one of you .

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.117
Stop selling out your own species.

That fucking Barris.

You know how he works?

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.274
He doesn't kill anybody . . .

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:21.153
. . . but he hangs around until
the situation arises where they die .

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:25.658
And then he just sits there .

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:30.746
And he sort of sets them up
in the first place while he stays out of it.

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:34.667
But l'm not sure how.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:38.504
Hey , do you have that money for the stuff?
l need it tonight.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:41.841
-Yeah . l have it.
-Okay .

You know, l don't like Barris.

And l don't trust him .

Guy's fucking crazy .

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.725
And when you're around him ,
you start acting crazy .

01:02:51.852 --> 01:02:54.645
And then when you're not around him ,
you're fine .

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:57.731
You're acting crazy now.

Little spring flowers with blue in them
that come up first.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.809
Yeah .

That's fucking lame . l gotta go .

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.535

How much do you do?

Not that much .
And l don't shoot up .

Once you start shooting ,
you got like six months , maybe .

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.294
And even tap water.

01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:07.171

You know what l wanna do someday , Bob?

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:38.243

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.470
Well , screw it. Screw it.

Rolling joints and rattling on and on?

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.249
They live here with you?

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:09.251
Two of them do .

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.796
So you're gay?

Try not to be .
That's why l called you tonight.

So you're putting up
a pretty good battle against it.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:23.055
You better believe it.

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:26.059
Guess l'm about to find out.

01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:31.314
lf you're a latent gay ,
then you'll want me to take the initiative .

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.859
You want me to undress you?

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:35.569
Sure .

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:31.124
Oh , Jesus, fuck.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.852
Hello?

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.147
<i>Fred , we've processed</i>
<i>some more recent material on you .</i>

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:56.358
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.569
Okay .

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.988
<i>Any problems?</i>

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:03.156
Well , l had a fight with my girl .

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:04.616
<i>Any confusion?</i>

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:10.122
<i>Are you experiencing any difficulty</i>
<i>identifying persons or objects?</i>

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.457
<i>Any language disorientation?</i>

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.167
No .

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:16.712
<i>Can you come back over to room 203?</i>

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:20.173
What did you find to be a problem?

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.384
<i>We'll take that up when you get here .</i>

01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:29.534
Connie .

01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:33.246
Donna.

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:04.111
All right, Fred . Very good .

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:07.531
And this next test,
with your eyes covered . . .

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.410
. . . reach out and feel an object
with each hand .

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.788
You are to tell us if the object
presented to your left hand . . .

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:17.624
. . . is identical to the object
presented to your right.

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:44.735
One more thing , Fred .

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:46.570
We need an updated blood test.

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:50.157
So go down the hall to the pathology lab ,
and they'll fix you up .

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:53.869
And by the time you get back, we should
almost be through with our evaluation .

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:55.662
l'll be upstairs with Hank.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:58.040
You certainly seem
much more depressed today . . .

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:00.292
. . .than you did when we first saw you .

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:05.172
Pardon?

01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:08.884
Last week, when we first saw you ,
you were kidding and laughing .

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:11.261
Did you ever get her the flowers?

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.772
<i>Crazy job they gave me .</i>

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:24.983
<i>But if l wasn't doing it,</i>
<i>someone else would be .</i>

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:27.194
<i>And they might get it wrong .</i>

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:31.698
<i>They might set Arctor up,</i>
<i>plant drugs on him and collect a reward .</i>

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:35.577
<i>Better it be me ,</i>
<i>despite the disadvantages.</i>

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:40.582
<i>Just protecting everyone from Barris</i>
<i>is justification in itself.</i>

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.836
<i>What the hell am l talking about?</i>

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.463
<i>l must be nuts.</i>

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:50.008
<i>l know Bob Arctor. He's a good person .</i>

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:55.597
<i>He's up to nothing .</i>
<i>At least, nothing too bad .</i>

01:13:57.642 --> 01:14:01.394
<i>ln fact, he works for the Orange County</i>
<i>Sheriff's Office covertly . . .</i>

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:05.107
<i>. . .which is probably why Barris is after him .</i>

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.609
<i>But that wouldn't explain . . .</i>

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:10.654
<i>. . .why the Orange County Sheriff's Office</i>
<i>is after him .</i>

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:17.410
<i>Something big is definitely</i>
<i>going down in this house .</i>

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:21.498
<i>This rundown, rubble-filled house . . .</i>

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:23.542
<i>. . .with its weed-patch yard . . .</i>

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:26.419
<i>. . . and cat box that never gets emptied .</i>

01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:29.422
<i>What a waste of a truly good house .</i>

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.425
<i>So much could be done with it.</i>

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.637
<i>A family and children could live here .</i>

01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:38.056
<i>lt was designed for that.</i>

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:39.724
<i>Such a waste .</i>

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:43.937
<i>They ought to confiscate it</i>
<i>and put it to better use .</i>

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:59.953
<i>l'm supposed to act like they aren't here .</i>

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:03.248
<i>Assuming there's a "they" at all .</i>

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:06.626
<i>lt may just be my imagination .</i>

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.588
<i>Whatever it is that's watching . . .</i>

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:11.923
<i>. . . it's not human . . .</i>

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:14.759
<i>. . . unlike little dark-eyed Donna .</i>

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:17.470
<i>lt doesn't eVer blink.</i>

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.808
<i>What does a scanner see?</i>

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.060
<i>lnto the head?</i>

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.730
<i>Down into the heart?</i>

01:15:27.315 --> 01:15:30.650
<i>Does it see into me , into us?</i>

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.069
<i>Clearly or darkly?</i>

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:39.201
<i>l hope it sees clearly,</i>
<i>because l can't any longer see into myself.</i>

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.578
<i>l see only murk.</i>

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:45.999
<i>l hope for everyone's sake</i>
<i>the scanners do better.</i>

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.503
<i>Because if the scanner sees only darkly,</i>
<i>the way l do . . .</i>

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:54.674
<i>. . .then l'm cursed and cursed again .</i>

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.761
<i>And we'll only wind up dead this way . . .</i>

01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:04.059
<i>. . . knowing very little</i>
<i>and getting that little fragment wrong too .</i>

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.441
You show what we regard . . .

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:15.862
. . . more as competition phenomenon
than impairment.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:17.530
Yeah?

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:21.534
Competition between the left and the right
hemispheres of your brain .

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:24.663
lt's like you have two signals
that interfere with each other. . .

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:27.499
. . . by carrying conflicting information .

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:30.335
lt's as if you have two fuel gauges
on your car.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.504
They're studying
the same amount of fuel . . .

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:35.840
. . . but one says your tank is full ,
the other registers empty .

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.384
They can't both be right.

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:41.137
And you as the driver have only
an indirect relationship to the fuel tank. . .

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:42.555
. . .via the gauges .

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:45.642
So , what does all this mean?

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:48.520
Well , l'm sure you know already .

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:52.565
You've been experiencing it
without knowing why or what it is .

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:56.486
Two hemispheres of my brain . . .

01:16:56.988 --> 01:16:58.446
. . . are competing?

01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:00.448
-Yes .
-Yes .

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:05.578
But why?

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:07.122
Substance D .

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:11.334
lt often causes that, functionally ,
and this is what the tests confirm .

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:14.587
Damage has taken place
to the normally dominant left hemisphere . . .

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:17.299
. . . and the right hemisphere
is attempting to compensate .

01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:18.758
Crosscutting , we call it. . .

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:21.136
. . . related to split-brain phenomenon .

01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:25.473
We could perform
a right hemispherectomy . . .

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.100
. . . but l'd--

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:29.728
Will this ever go away?

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:33.023
Probably . lt's a functional impairment.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:36.443
lt may be organic damage .

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:38.111
lt may be permanent.

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:42.449
Time will tell , and only after you've
been off Substance D for a long while .

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:48.705
l'll never take Substance D again
for the rest of my life .

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:51.583
How much are you taking now?

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.834
Not much .

01:17:53.753 --> 01:17:56.629
More , recently , because of job stress .

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:08.308
<i>Death is swallowed up in victory .</i>

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.728
<i>Behold, l tell you the sacred secret now:</i>

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:15.148
<i>You shall not all sleep in death .</i>

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:22.489
<i>We'll do the other half</i>
<i>of Southern California tomorrow night.</i>

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:25.992
<i>The Air Force arsenal at Vandenberg</i>
<i>will be hit for automatic weapons--</i>

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:29.204
<i>What about that anthrax</i>
<i>Anwar ripped off for us?</i>

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:32.957
<i>When do we--? Aren't we supposed to</i>
<i>carry the stuff up to the watershed area--?</i>

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:34.626
<i>We need the weapons first.</i>

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:37.212
<i>Drugs in the water supply is step B .</i>

01:18:37.421 --> 01:18:39.839
<i>Okay, but l gotta go . l got a customer.</i>

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:42.675
l can also identify
the aforementioned terrorist cell .

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.637
lt's indicated throughout the course
of my observations .

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:49.516
Do you have any more material of this sort,
or is this tape substantially it?

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:51.309
No , l have a veritable cornucopia. . .

01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:55.105
. . . and much of it is directly referencing
the organization and its directives .

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:57.899
Who are these people?
What organization?

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:01.111
lt is primarily Arctor and Hawthorne .

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.697
l have coded notes here , which may be
of some interest to you .

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:09.619
l-- My own cryptology
is very difficult to--

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:12.664
As of now l'm impounding all of this.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:16.251
lt is our property temporarily ,
and we will sort through it ourselves .

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:20.713
You will be on hand
to explain anything to us . . .

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:25.051
. . . if and when we get to the point
where we feel we need anything explained .

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:30.723
Mr. Barris, you will not be released
pending our study of this material .

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:34.727
You will be charged , as a formality ,
to keep you available . . .

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:38.356
. . .with knowingly giving the authorities
false information .

01:19:38.566 --> 01:19:42.735
This, of course , is just a pretext
for your own safety .

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:45.738
l always wanted to go
to the Galapagos--

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.741
-ls that satisfactory , Mr. Barris?
-Not entirely .

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:50.743
Though l wonder,
when l'm locked down . . .

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:54.664
. . . may l be provided with some lotion ,
and perhaps some . . . ?

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:06.676
So , what do you think
of Barris' evidence?

01:20:08.596 --> 01:20:12.348
Seems like what he played--
The little we heard anyway .

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:14.851
--sounded pretty genuine to me .

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.771
lt's fake . Worthless .

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:20.773
Made on a home computer.

01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:23.109
Maybe you're right.

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:27.780
ls that my medical report you have there?

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:29.407
Yep .

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:31.784
What does it say?

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:35.663
That you're completely bonkers.

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:39.292
Completely?

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.297
There's maybe two brain cells
that still light up .

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:46.257
Rest is just. . .

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:48.885
. . . short circuits and sparks .

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.803
Two?

01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:58.144
Listen , when you go to pick up
your next paycheck. . .

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:01.898
. . .there will be a substantial difference
this time .

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:05.193
l get some sort of bonus for this--?

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:10.198
For this having happened to me on duty?

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:13.451
No . Read your penal code .

01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:18.206
"An officer who willingly becomes an addict
and doesn't report it promptly . . .

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:20.583
. . . is subject to a misdemeanor charge . . .

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:23.711
. . . a fine , and/or six months ."

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:26.839
You'll probably just be fined .

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.675
Willingly?

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:32.887
No one held a gun to your head
and shot you up .

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:35.098
No one dropped something in your soup .

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:38.393
You knowingly and willingly
took an addictive drug . . .

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:40.853
. . . brain-destructive and disorienting .

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:42.772
l had to .

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.650
You could have pretended to .

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:48.403
Most officers manage to cope with it.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:54.867
And from the quantities
you were taking . . . .

01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:58.580
My God , Fred , l . . . .

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:02.542
Hey , you know what l would do
if l were you?

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:05.962
Once you get out of New Path and ,
you know, it's all over--

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:08.089
But it may never be over.

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:11.801
Cigarette?

01:22:13.304 --> 01:22:16.514
l'm getting off that too . Everything .

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:19.642
lncluding chocolate . Yeah .

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:22.020
And . . . .

01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:24.188
Like l tell my kids . . . .

01:22:26.025 --> 01:22:29.027
l've got two kids. Two girls.

01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:31.112
Little ones .

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:36.492
l don't believe you do .

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.580
You're not supposed to .

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.041
Maybe not.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:07.607
Listen , is there anywhere specific
you'd like to go?

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:12.111
Maybe over to Donna Hawthorne's place?

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:16.949
From the information you brought in ,
sounds like you guys are pretty close.

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:21.287
Yes , we are .

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:23.915
How'd you know that?

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.959
Process of elimination .

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:29.712
l know who you aren't. . .

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:32.840
. . . and we're talking about
a very small group of people . . .

01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:35.176
. . .that we hoped would lead us higher.

01:23:35.386 --> 01:23:37.095
And maybe Barris will .

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:41.265
l pieced it together a long time ago
that you're Arctor.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.729
l'm who?

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.901
l'm Bob Arctor?

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.990
Yeah , get me
Donna Hawthorne's number. . .

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.702
. . .or just patch me through
when you locate her.

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:02.870
Thanks .

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:06.582
Bud , you are in a very bad way ,
my friend .

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:08.793
Maybe Jim Barris poisoned you .

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:11.546
We're really interested in Barris,
not you .

01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:15.258
The whole scanning of the house
was to keep an eye on him .

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:20.972
We hoped to draw him here , and we did .

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:25.977
He is deep into it
with some very dangerous people .

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:30.898
Then l'm a what?

01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:33.443
Well , we had to get to Barris
to set him up .

01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:35.820
So how we arranged it was. . .

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:38.990
. . . he grew progressively
more and more suspicious . . .

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:43.494
. . .that you were an undercover cop trying
to nail him or use him to get high or--

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:47.039
So he did what you or anyone
would have done .

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:48.458
Hey , Donna.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.795
Yeah , hi , this is a buddy of Bob's.
Arctor.

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:55.047
Yeah .

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:59.385
Listen , he's in a-- He's in a bad way .

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:03.055
Yeah , way bad .

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:07.143
l was wondering if l could
ask a favor of you .

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:09.562
You're a sweetheart.

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:13.816
Yeah , l'm sure he'll
appreciate it very much .

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:16.402
Great, thanks. Good news.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:20.698
Donna Hawthorne said she'd pick you up
out front in about five minutes.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:26.037
You fuckers .

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:28.391
You're a good man , Bob .

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:31.352
You've been dealt a bad deal .

01:26:31.562 --> 01:26:35.481
This is not fair, but it has to be this way .

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:37.024
You just--

01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:41.153
You gotta-- You gotta just wait it out,
just get through it.

01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:43.489
And someday . . .

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:46.576
. . . a long time from now. . .

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.995
. . .you'll see the way you saw before .

01:26:50.163 --> 01:26:53.082
There'll be a recognition . . .

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:58.421
. . . and some spark in a disguised form . . .

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.715
. . .will reveal itself to you . . .

01:27:01.592 --> 01:27:03.968
. . . and guide you .

01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:31.829
-Substance D?
-Yeah .

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.248
Ate his head .

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:36.208
Another loser.

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:38.961
lt's easy to win .

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:42.673
Anybody can win .

01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:53.225
Goodbye .

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:05.613
Living and unliving things
are exchanging properties .

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:12.036
The drive of unliving things is stronger
than the drive of living things .

01:28:14.373 --> 01:28:19.335
The living should never be used
to serve the purposes of the dead .

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:25.007
But the dead should , if possible . . .

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:28.552
. . . serve the purposes of the living .

01:28:44.695 --> 01:28:46.237
Hey , good news .

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.698
l think l got you transferred
to one of our farms .

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:52.243
-Can l work with animals?
-l think you'll be working with plants. . .

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:55.162
. . .for a while . ln the open ,
where you can touch the ground .

01:28:55.288 --> 01:28:58.290
-l wanna be with something living .
-The ground is living .

01:28:58.417 --> 01:29:00.543
The earth is still alive .

01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:03.295
Do you have any agricultural background?

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.131
l worked in an office .

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:08.300
Well , you'll be outside from now on .

01:29:32.492 --> 01:29:34.326
Your name is Bruce .

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:36.537
My name is Bruce .

01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:41.083
We're gonna try you on farming
for a period , Bruce .

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:45.004
-Okay .
-Staff thought you'd be better off.

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.339
l think you'll like it here .

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:49.884
l think l'll like it here .

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:53.679
Come on , l'll show you
where you're gonna be sleeping .

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:56.932
You like mountains, Bruce?

01:29:57.142 --> 01:29:58.350
Look up .

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:00.186
Mountains .

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:03.230
No snow, but mountains .

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:05.024
l like mountains .

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.401
The air is good here .

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:09.904
l like air.

01:30:10.697 --> 01:30:11.989
Yeah .

01:30:12.199 --> 01:30:15.367
We all like air, Bruce . We really do .

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:17.953
That we have in common .

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:22.875
4G .

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:24.877
Yours is 4G . Can you remember that?

01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:26.670
4G .

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:30.674
Will l be seeing my friends?

01:30:31.384 --> 01:30:33.677
What, you mean
from back where you were?

01:30:33.887 --> 01:30:35.513
The Santa Ana facility?

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:38.390
Mike and Laura. . .

01:30:38.475 --> 01:30:41.393
. . . and Mike and Eddie .

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:44.480
-And--
-The people from the residence facilities. . .

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:47.149
. . .they don't come out
to the farms , Bruce .

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:50.694
-See , these are closed operations.
-Closed operations.

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:53.989
But, you know,
you might get back up there . . .

01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:55.658
. . .couple times a year.

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:58.410
You know,
there are gatherings at Christmas. . .

01:30:58.578 --> 01:31:00.412
. . . and the next one is Thanksgiving .

01:31:00.413 --> 01:31:01.705
Thanksgiving .

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:05.167
So you might see them in three months.

01:31:18.557 --> 01:31:20.432
Hey , Audrey .

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:22.685
Glad you could meet.

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:26.647
So tell me , are they
getting paranoid about him?

01:31:26.857 --> 01:31:29.441
No , not at all . The guy's so burnt-out.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.946
And we're still convinced
they're growing the stuff?

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:37.074
They have to be . Who else?

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:41.453
l just wonder
if it even matters at this--

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:44.874
lt matters , Audrey .

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:48.169
lt matters when we can prove
that New Path is the one growing . . .

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:50.129
. . . manufacturing and distributing .

01:31:51.548 --> 01:31:53.549
How does he look?

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:57.511
l mean , do you think he's gonna
be able to pull through for us?

01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:00.472
All we can do is hope
that when he finally gets in there . . .

01:32:00.599 --> 01:32:05.477
. . . a few charred brain cells will flicker on
and some distant instinct will kick in .

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.146
lt's just. . . .

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:11.483
-lt's just such a cost to pay .
-Yeah .

01:32:11.735 --> 01:32:13.944
But there's no other way to get in there .

01:32:14.154 --> 01:32:17.156
l couldn't, and think how long l tried .

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.241
They got that place locked up tight.

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:22.494
They're only gonna let a burnt-out husk
like Bruce in .

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:26.332
Harmless . You have to be ,
or they won't take the risk.

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:29.335
Yeah , but to sacrifice someone . . .

01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:32.504
. . . a living person ,
without them ever knowing it.

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:36.050
l mean , if he'd understood ,
if he had volunteered . . .

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:38.135
. . . but he doesn't know and he never did .

01:32:38.345 --> 01:32:40.512
He didn't volunteer for this .

01:32:40.513 --> 01:32:43.182
Sure he did . lt was his job .

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:45.643
lt wasn't his job to get addicted .

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:48.479
We took care of that.

01:32:48.521 --> 01:32:50.606
Look, Mike , l gotta get out.

01:32:50.815 --> 01:32:53.150
l can't do this again .

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:56.278
l want it to end . l--

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:59.114
l lay in bed at night, and l can't sleep ,
and l just think:

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:02.993
-"Shit, we are colder than they are ."
-l don't think so .

01:33:03.203 --> 01:33:06.121
l mean , l believe God's m .o .
is to transmute evil into good . . .

01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:08.999
. . . and if he's active here ,
he's doing that now. . .

01:33:09.209 --> 01:33:11.543
. . . although our eyes can't perceive it.

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:14.880
The whole process is hidden
beneath the surface of our reality . . .

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:17.549
. . .will only be revealed later.

01:33:18.301 --> 01:33:20.052
And even then . . .

01:33:20.262 --> 01:33:22.513
. . .the people of the future . . .

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:26.183
. . .our children's children
will never truly know. . .

01:33:26.393 --> 01:33:30.104
. . .this awful time that we have
gone through and the losses we took.

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:34.984
Well , maybe some footnote
in a minor history book.

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:38.862
A brief mention
with no list of the fallen .

01:34:25.327 --> 01:34:27.619
You're seeing the flower of the future .

01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:31.623
-But not for you , Bruce .
-Not for me .

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:34.376
No , you've had too much
of a good thing already .

01:34:35.628 --> 01:34:38.630
Get up , get up . Stop worshipping .

01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:41.633
This isn't your god anymore ,
although it once was .

01:34:42.635 --> 01:34:44.178
Gone .

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:46.972
Flowers gone .

01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:49.141
No , you just can't see them .

01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:51.018
Back to work.

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:55.647
l saw.

01:34:56.649 --> 01:34:59.109
Back to work, Bruce .

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:06.658
l saw death rising from the earth . . .

01:35:08.244 --> 01:35:10.662
. . .from the ground itself. . .

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:16.877
. . . in one blue field .

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.676
A present for my friends . . .

01:35:25.345 --> 01:35:27.513
. . . at Thanksgiving .
