WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:04.500
I still can't believe you guys
are getting married.

00:04.583 --> 00:07.125
I know. My girlfriends
think I'm crazy...

00:07.959 --> 00:09.625
about...you...

00:09.709 --> 00:11.792
Because you're so damn cute.

00:12.458 --> 00:13.583
Good save.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.333
Thank you very much for coming
out tonight, guys.

00:15.417 --> 00:17.500
Oh, come on. This is the only
way to celebrate, right,

00:17.583 --> 00:21.917
with close friends and...
Nurse Roberts.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.959
Oh, hey, now don't get all pissy
now.

00:24.041 --> 00:26.250
You said, "My treat.
Order whatever you want.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.291
You didn't say order whatever
you want except the lobster."

00:28.375 --> 00:29.583
I said no shellfish.

00:30.417 --> 00:31.709
(J.D.) <i>I wasn't really mad.</i>

00:31.792 --> 00:33.709
<i>This was great, except for one</i>
<i>thing...</i>

00:33.792 --> 00:36.291
-Can't celebrate without beer.
-You're absolutely right.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.125
(J.D.)
<i>Sure Paul was dating Elliot,</i>

00:38.208 --> 00:40.208
<i>but, luckily,</i>
<i>I'm not the jealous type.</i>

00:40.291 --> 00:43.333
Well, uh, I'll go ahead
and make a little toast here,

00:43.417 --> 00:46.959
um, a toast that only people
that have known Turk and Carla

00:47.041 --> 00:48.875
for more than a week
will understand.

00:51.291 --> 00:52.542
You guys rock.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.333
You do.

00:54.417 --> 00:56.417
(J.D.)
<i>How's that taste, blondie?</i>

00:56.500 --> 00:59.500
You guys, you know, I've just
gotten to know you as a couple,

00:59.583 --> 01:01.542
but you remind me
of my grandparents.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.542
They were married
for 65 years,

01:03.625 --> 01:05.000
and every night before grandpa
and grandma

01:05.083 --> 01:06.583
would walk around the block,

01:06.667 --> 01:09.125
he would look deep into her eyes
as if to say,

01:09.208 --> 01:10.625
"I'd follow you anywhere."

01:11.750 --> 01:13.667
Anyway, the way you two
just looked at each other...

01:14.291 --> 01:15.875
I could've sworn
I was lookin' at them.

01:20.834 --> 01:23.000
Lame. Heh heh. This guy...

01:25.959 --> 01:26.959
Good morning, Dr. Kelso.

01:27.041 --> 01:30.083
Dr. Dorian, how is it this whole
hospital gets up in arms

01:30.166 --> 01:32.667
every time our MRI machine
misses a tumor?

01:32.750 --> 01:35.667
But every morning our coffee
machine spits out warm urine,

01:35.750 --> 01:38.125
-and nobody gives 2 hoots.
-Did we miss another tumor?

01:38.208 --> 01:40.375
Who cares? The point is,
I have to go across the street

01:40.458 --> 01:43.959
to get coffee, piping-hot coffee
that puts a hop in your step

01:44.041 --> 01:45.417
and your ass in the John.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.583
I just wish
I really knew

01:46.667 --> 01:48.250
why it hurt
so much right here.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.542
Well, Mr. Simms, it could be
because it's damp out.

01:50.625 --> 01:52.625
It could also be
because 4 days ago

01:52.709 --> 01:54.959
I sliced your chest open
with a giant knife.

01:55.041 --> 01:56.792
You had surgery, buddy.
You'll be fine.

01:56.875 --> 01:59.875
Hey, Dr. Dorian,
I have a couple of minutes off.

01:59.959 --> 02:01.458
Would you like me to show you
that technique

02:01.542 --> 02:03.041
-I was telling you about?
-Yes, doctor.

02:04.166 --> 02:08.458
Now, what you wanna do is choke
up on the club like this...

02:09.291 --> 02:12.208
and then hit this bad boy
like a baseball.

02:13.542 --> 02:15.000
You can't teach that.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.375
No, you cannot my friend.
No, you cannot.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.250
So what was up
with Mr. Simms back there?

02:19.333 --> 02:21.750
Ah, during
his open-lung biopsy,

02:21.834 --> 02:24.333
I accidentally nicked
the intercostal artery

02:24.417 --> 02:26.834
-and now he's got a hematoma.
-Are you gonna tell 'em?

02:26.917 --> 02:28.834
What, and risk a lawsuit?
Are you crazy?

02:29.333 --> 02:31.208
Besides,
he'll heal just fine anyway.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.291
Hey, throw me another ball.

02:33.375 --> 02:35.834
Yeah, but don't you
believe in bad Karma?

02:35.917 --> 02:36.917
No.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.542
One cup of lava comin' through.

02:43.625 --> 02:46.792
(screaming)

02:46.875 --> 02:49.917
I don't know. Me? I think Karma
keeps the universe in order.

02:50.208 --> 02:51.583
Karma shmarma.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.417
Now, listen, if you're not
getting the length

02:53.500 --> 02:54.583
on the drive that you need,

02:54.667 --> 02:56.500
a lot of your better pros
take a running start.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.458
Okey-dokey.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.166
(car brakes screech)

(J.D.) <i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Do not say "splotchy."</i>

03:31.125 --> 03:32.500
Good splotchy,
Dr. Splotchy.

03:32.583 --> 03:35.083
Oh, please.
It's barely noticeable.

03:35.166 --> 03:37.125
Oh! Dark roast.

03:37.208 --> 03:38.542
Damn it.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.291
There she is.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.667
Hey, are you ready
to be born today?

03:43.250 --> 03:44.750
Get the hell away
from my stomach,

03:44.834 --> 03:45.917
or I'll put you in a leglock

03:46.000 --> 03:48.667
and snap your little bird neck
with my enormous thighs.

03:49.375 --> 03:50.875
Enjoy your special day.

03:50.959 --> 03:52.166
Thanks.

03:52.250 --> 03:54.709
Now, in honor of
this little goblin's arrival,

03:54.792 --> 03:57.125
I have gone ahead
and taken care of everything.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.542
Dr. Gerson will be waiting
to induce you.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.834
She will also administer
the world's largest epidural.

04:02.917 --> 04:05.834
I have "woe-ho-fully"
under qualified residents

04:05.917 --> 04:07.083
covering all of my patients

04:07.166 --> 04:10.000
so that I can be with you
every step of the way.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.041
And here's the kicker,

04:12.125 --> 04:14.625
I have traded every single
one of my weekends.

04:14.709 --> 04:16.083
I have called in every favor,

04:16.166 --> 04:18.834
and I have kissed every pompous
wrinkled ass

04:18.917 --> 04:20.417
in this fluorescent hellhole

04:20.500 --> 04:24.834
so that I could secure for you
the one and only Mac daddy,

04:24.917 --> 04:28.500
out-of-your-mind birthing suite
in this entire hospital.

04:29.166 --> 04:30.667
Nice job, Alice.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.875
(bzzzzt)

04:38.250 --> 04:39.250
Hey, Paul.

04:39.875 --> 04:40.875
What are you doin' down here?

04:40.959 --> 04:42.709
I just need a nurse
to help me out.

04:42.792 --> 04:45.041
Hey, this name tag
says "Paul Flowers, nurse,"

04:45.125 --> 04:47.458
not "Paul Flowers,
Elliot Reid's boyfriend."

04:47.542 --> 04:48.625
Now, what do you need?

04:48.709 --> 04:51.083
Mr. Mahoney threw up on himself.
He needs a bath.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.959
Hey, uh, Deena, my girlfriend's
got a job for you.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.417
Yeah, right.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.041
Paul, um, I just want you
to know

04:59.125 --> 05:01.000
I am having such
a good time with you.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.250
Me, too.

05:03.959 --> 05:05.375
Hey, sorry I didn't call you
last night.

05:05.458 --> 05:06.542
I just totally crashed.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.333
No big deal.

05:08.417 --> 05:10.458
See, I love that you don't let
the little things bother you,

05:10.542 --> 05:11.875
like right now you've got pit
stains,

05:11.959 --> 05:14.625
and you're just like, "whatever.
I'm workin' hard."

05:15.250 --> 05:17.208
What can I day?
I'm an easygoin' gal.

05:17.291 --> 05:20.250
Heh heh...Ehh...
Oh, my God!

05:20.333 --> 05:23.083
I need deodorant
and a dry top over here!

05:24.875 --> 05:26.542
(J.D.)
<i>Doctors love to use humor.</i>

05:26.625 --> 05:29.542
<i>Well, Mr. Foster,</i>
<i>your blood tests are back,</i>

05:29.625 --> 05:31.250
<i>and the good news is,</i>
<i>you're not pregnant.</i>

05:31.333 --> 05:32.583
Ha ha ha!

05:32.667 --> 05:34.333
Heh! You're--

05:34.417 --> 05:35.667
eh heh.

05:35.750 --> 05:36.875
<i>(Seinfeld</i> theme plays)

05:36.959 --> 05:38.500
I said, "not pregnant."

05:39.542 --> 05:40.709
Is this thing on?

05:41.583 --> 05:44.750
And, hey, what is the deal
with Q-Tips?

05:44.834 --> 05:47.291
They're not Qs
and they're not tips!

05:47.709 --> 05:48.709
(zap)

05:48.792 --> 05:50.000
(clang)

05:52.417 --> 05:54.792
Uh, but, unfortunately,
the CAT scan

05:54.875 --> 05:56.375
suggests a laceration
in your spleen,

05:56.458 --> 05:59.125
which is why I asked
for a surgical consult.

05:59.792 --> 06:00.917
So how'd this happen,
anyway?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
A golf ball hit my windshield,
and I drove into a tree.

06:10.166 --> 06:11.250
Ok, here's the deal,

06:11.333 --> 06:14.250
you are, in fact, supposed to be
up in the Mac daddy suite,

06:14.333 --> 06:16.917
but the woman who's in there is
in her 40th hour of labor.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.834
Did you explain to her
that it is my room?

06:19.917 --> 06:20.959
I started to,

06:21.041 --> 06:23.625
but then she screamed, grunted
and pooped on the table.

06:23.709 --> 06:25.875
God, it always cracks me up

06:25.959 --> 06:28.208
that they never tell pregnant
women to expect that one.

06:28.291 --> 06:31.083
I'm going to poo
in front of people?

06:31.166 --> 06:32.166
No.

06:33.417 --> 06:34.709
Yeah.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.041
We are so done talking.

06:36.125 --> 06:37.792
-Don't tease me.
-Where's Dr. Gerson?

06:37.875 --> 06:39.000
He's up in that room
with the woman.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.792
Then who the hell's
gonna take care of me?

06:40.875 --> 06:42.125
Sending her a resident.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.250
Hey, happy couple.
Hi. I'm Donna Berlutti,

06:45.333 --> 06:48.417
but you can call me,
"Dr. Donna." Ah ha ha ha!

06:49.041 --> 06:51.041
Carla, you know how
I'm really crazy?

06:51.125 --> 06:52.125
Sure. What's up?

06:52.208 --> 06:54.125
It's just gettin' so hard to
hide the crazy from Paul.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.792
Oh, I hear you, girl.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.333
I mean, Turk and I
are engaged,

06:57.417 --> 06:59.125
and it wasn't until last week
that I admitted

06:59.208 --> 07:00.333
the reason that I don't touch
the seat

07:00.417 --> 07:01.917
when I go to the
bathroom isn't because of germs,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.917
but because I'm afraid
of toilet snakes.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.083
And... now, so am I.

07:06.166 --> 07:08.917
Look, I think with men
you just have to hold out

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
until they're invested enough

07:10.083 --> 07:11.875
they won't run away at the first
thing that spooks them.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.542
I know. And with Paul,

07:13.625 --> 07:15.458
I really feel like we're
getting pretty close right now.

07:15.542 --> 07:17.250
So... you guys have...?

07:17.333 --> 07:20.166
Not yet, but tonight's
our fourth date, so...

07:20.250 --> 07:21.333
4 dates?

07:21.417 --> 07:23.542
Yeah. It's one date
longer than the sluts,

07:23.625 --> 07:24.959
one date shorter
than the prudes.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.834
I am 4-date Reid.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.417
Yeah, but what about
that surgeon the other--

07:29.500 --> 07:30.667
I'm 4-date Reid!

07:31.375 --> 07:32.375
Hey, cutie...

07:32.792 --> 07:34.208
Hey, you ready for our third
date?

07:34.291 --> 07:35.959
Fourth date.
You're forgetting about the time

07:36.041 --> 07:38.000
we ran into each other
at the coffee machine.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.333
You shut up.

07:40.208 --> 07:41.375
Hi.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.083
What the hell am I doin'
playing golf?

07:45.166 --> 07:46.500
This is all
Tiger Woods' fault.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.583
This guy's gonna sue the
hospital, we're gonna get fired,

07:48.667 --> 07:50.417
we'll have to
become male whores.

07:51.291 --> 07:52.500
Very successful male whores.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.542
We'll probably have a nicer
apartment and some bling-bling,

07:54.625 --> 07:55.792
but male whores, nonetheless.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.208
Relax, all right?
Nobody knows about this but US.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.125
-We'll be fine.
-Hey, guys.

08:00.542 --> 08:03.709
Check out the personalized golf
club cozy I found on the roof.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.375
Hi, Davey.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.792
You and your stupid
Christmas present.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.083
Yeah, seems like one
of the golf balls you hit

08:09.166 --> 08:10.375
went through
the windshield of my van.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.750
No big deal. I just expect you
to replace it. That's all.

08:13.834 --> 08:15.917
Your windshield's been broken
for, like, a year.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.500
Yeah, I know. Still.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.750
Oh, no.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.458
Looks like we're in a pickle.

08:23.542 --> 08:25.083
Pick-pick-pickle.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.000
Diggity-boogety-boogety-
boogety-boogety-pop!

08:28.083 --> 08:29.834
Here's the keys.
Have it back by tomorrow.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.250
-Who are you?
-Dr. Turk.

08:33.917 --> 08:34.917
I don't care.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.750
I'm not gonna lie to ya there,
Bob.

08:40.834 --> 08:43.083
I have not been having
the greatest day.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.625
Perry, I just drew in this
eyebrow 5 minutes ago,

08:46.709 --> 08:48.458
so cry me a river.

08:48.542 --> 08:51.625
Anyway, Jordan and I got stuck
in this crappy room

08:51.709 --> 08:53.333
and I was wonderin' if--

08:54.000 --> 08:56.625
if--whew. Well...

08:56.709 --> 08:59.792
Perry, if you want a favor,
don't beat around the bush.

09:00.959 --> 09:02.917
Just curtsy.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.000
I beg your pardon, there,
backdraft?

09:05.083 --> 09:06.458
You heard what I said.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.083
Well?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.834
Always remember
how I made you do that.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.291
Ha ha ha ha-- ooh...

09:19.667 --> 09:22.625
Hey, fellas, it's always nice
to have visitors.

09:23.417 --> 09:25.709
So, uh, what's the dealio?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.291
Ted, how bad
would it really be

09:28.375 --> 09:31.625
if 2 doctors were hittin' golf
balls off the roof

09:31.709 --> 09:33.125
and they caused a car accident

09:33.208 --> 09:35.083
and the driver needed surgery?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.250
Ted?

09:38.333 --> 09:40.834
Hey, fellas, always nice
to have visitors.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.166
So what's the dealio?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.667
No dealio, Ted.
We just stopped by to say hi.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.542
Hi.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.000
See ya later, buddy.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.333
Later.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.375
(J.D.) <i>We both knew</i>
<i>what we had to do.</i>

09:55.458 --> 09:57.542
-Let's come clean.
-Let's not tell anyone, ever.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.208
Ever! Ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever. Ever!

10:01.500 --> 10:03.792
-Ever?
-Ever.

10:07.291 --> 10:09.750
(J.D.) <i>I guess it's hard to</i>
<i>predict how a person will react.</i>

10:10.625 --> 10:12.792
So, you want to come in?

10:12.875 --> 10:14.750
Nah. That's ok.
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:20.291 --> 10:21.291
Well, then, Jordan,

10:21.375 --> 10:23.500
why don't we just think of today
as a test run?

10:23.583 --> 10:26.375
(J.D.) <i>Other times, people react</i>
<i>exactly how you think they will.</i>

10:26.458 --> 10:27.875
Honestly, Perry, the only way

10:27.959 --> 10:29.375
I could have felt
more taken care of

10:29.458 --> 10:31.834
is if I were at a 4-star resort
or a spa

10:31.917 --> 10:34.667
or a third-world country where
you have to boil your own sewage

10:34.750 --> 10:35.917
if you want something to drink.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.333
Oh, and by the way, a giant,
giant feather in your cap

10:39.417 --> 10:42.166
for how much power you wield in
this hospital after 15 years--

10:42.250 --> 10:46.458
I am so sorry everything fell
apart today, honest to God I am,

10:46.542 --> 10:48.333
but I guarantee that when you
get here tomorrow

10:48.417 --> 10:49.959
Dr. Gerson will, in fact,

10:50.041 --> 10:52.667
be in the super-deluxe
birthing suite

10:52.750 --> 10:56.500
so that you can go ahead and
have that storybook, drug-adled,

10:56.583 --> 10:59.083
pitocin-induced pregnancy
that you've always dreamed of

10:59.166 --> 11:01.542
ever since you were a little
girl, but in the meantime,

11:01.625 --> 11:03.041
you've gotta
cut me a little slack.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.417
I mean, come on,

11:04.500 --> 11:05.834
it's not like
I see the real father

11:05.917 --> 11:07.375
runnin' around here
bustin' his hump.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.917
Oh, that's nice.
I'm going home.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.458
-No. No, you're not.
-Bye-bye.

11:12.542 --> 11:13.792
Jordan, you're water just broke.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.792
This kid's annoying me already.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.834
I think having babies
is so much fun, don't you?

11:27.917 --> 11:29.000
I will choke her.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.083
Please, Dr. Berlutti,
no more talking.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.291
Oh, you know, I really
prefer "Dr. Donna."

11:33.375 --> 11:35.375
"No" means "no,"
pep squad. Now, beat it.

11:35.959 --> 11:37.166
And, Jordan...

11:38.959 --> 11:40.458
I am not going to leave your
side

11:40.542 --> 11:42.125
until that baby is delivered.

11:42.208 --> 11:43.542
Get the hell out of here.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.166
-What?
-I'm serious.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.417
Why don't you do US both a favor
and get out?

11:49.375 --> 11:50.417
Fine.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.250
Ahem.

11:52.834 --> 11:54.166
It's important to stay positive.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.792
Get me an epidural
before I rip your teeth out!

11:56.875 --> 11:58.125
Okey-dokey.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.000
-Hey, girl's name!
-What?

12:01.083 --> 12:02.750
Give me a break. I've got a lot
on my mind, Ellen.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.000
Oh, look at that.
I bounced back.

12:05.083 --> 12:08.667
Anyway, the cave bat just kicked
me out of its lair,

12:08.750 --> 12:12.041
and seeings how I no longer have
my all-access pass to crazy town

12:12.125 --> 12:14.041
I'm going to need you
to occasionally go in there

12:14.125 --> 12:15.166
and poke her
with a broomstick,

12:15.250 --> 12:16.750
just to see
how she's doing.

12:16.834 --> 12:17.834
-Dr. Cox--
-Buh buh buh buh!

12:17.917 --> 12:20.333
Please...
Just check on her,

12:20.709 --> 12:23.583
Okay? Appreciate it.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.542
What if she has the baby
while I'm in there?

12:28.375 --> 12:31.625
-Aah!
<i>-(Rosemary's Baby</i> theme plays)

12:31.709 --> 12:33.542
Here it comes.

12:33.625 --> 12:34.625
What the hell is that?

12:35.291 --> 12:36.875
Goo-goo gah-gah!
Gah-gah goo-goo!

12:36.959 --> 12:39.041
Goo-goo! Gee-gee-gee!
(rawwrrrr)

12:39.125 --> 12:41.083
Aah! Get it off!

12:42.208 --> 12:43.792
Somebody, get it off!

12:45.792 --> 12:46.959
(J.D.)
<i>I'll check on her later.</i>

12:48.166 --> 12:49.583
Elliot, wait up. Elliot...

12:51.166 --> 12:52.166
Hey...

12:52.250 --> 12:54.083
I wanted to explain
about last night.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.959
We had a great time and I know
that you wanted me to come in

12:59.041 --> 12:59.959
to, you know...

13:00.041 --> 13:04.125
No, no, no. I invited you in
to see my... Fish tank.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.083
Is that what you ladies
are callin' it nowadays?

13:06.750 --> 13:07.834
Careful, Todd.

13:08.458 --> 13:09.709
Sorry, Nurse Flowers, sir.

13:10.917 --> 13:13.917
Elliot, listen, I think you're
an amazing girl, I really do,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.500
but something just didn't feel
right about last night.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.542
It's just that I've rushed
things with people in the past,

13:20.625 --> 13:22.041
and I don't want to
do that with you.

13:22.125 --> 13:23.709
(Eliot) <i>What does he mean,</i>
<i>"in the past"?</i>

13:23.792 --> 13:27.000
<i>Does he have an ex-girlfriend?</i>
<i>Is that her? Slut.</i>

13:27.709 --> 13:28.709
I feel the same way.

13:32.417 --> 13:33.542
Hey.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.500
Oh, I am onto you.

13:41.625 --> 13:44.709
So, now, why did you finally
agree to marry Ghandi?

13:44.792 --> 13:46.291
Well, he's amazing in bed,

13:46.375 --> 13:48.208
and he has an awesome
CD collection.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.458
Seriously,
what got you to the point

13:50.542 --> 13:51.917
where you weren't scared
anymore?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.834
Please, I'm still terrified.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.166
I mean, good luck finding a pen
cap at the nurses' station.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.542
-Know why?
-Why?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.166
-Ate 'em all.
-That sounds like

14:00.250 --> 14:01.583
good roughage to me.

14:02.458 --> 14:03.917
What do you do
when you get scared?

14:04.542 --> 14:06.625
Run away, get a divorce,
drink alone,

14:06.709 --> 14:08.083
you know, the classics.

14:08.959 --> 14:10.625
But the thing is that this time,

14:10.709 --> 14:12.875
I am killing myself
for this woman,

14:12.959 --> 14:14.750
and I'm still gettin' my ass
handed to me.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.667
There is no Shangri-La,
you know?

14:16.750 --> 14:18.417
Every relationship is messed up.

14:18.875 --> 14:19.917
What makes it perfect

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
is if you still want to be there
when things really suck.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.458
Yeah, well,
I'm not so sure.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.375
It'll come to you.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.291
All right, gentlemen, either of
you in the market for a van?

14:38.375 --> 14:39.542
$500.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.834
-The windshield cost that much.
-Oh, 800.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.125
No, thanks.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.291
Come on. There's still
half a deer in the back.

14:47.583 --> 14:48.709
I think that's a deer.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.417
(J.D.)
<i>After being blackmailed,</i>

14:51.500 --> 14:53.667
<i>I decided to go check</i>
<i>on Jordan.</i>

14:53.750 --> 14:57.333
<i>You tell me, Donna! Do I look</i>
<i>like I need more drugs?!</i>

14:57.417 --> 14:58.625
Oh, my face!

15:00.208 --> 15:02.250
Then again,
I have other problems,

15:02.333 --> 15:04.333
because I know that
some windshield hush money

15:04.417 --> 15:07.250
won't keep the Karma Gods
from comin' for Turk and me.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.917
Q-tip,
Dr. Murphy called.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.792
They need you to
cover his calls tonight.

15:13.125 --> 15:15.792
Dude, Dr. Wen's
doin' a stomach stapling,

15:15.875 --> 15:19.041
and he wants you to be there to
hold back the guy's fat flap.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.583
Apparently, my face
is scaring my patients,

15:24.667 --> 15:27.250
so you're going to take them off
my hands for about a week.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.500
Turk!

15:31.792 --> 15:33.208
The dairy queen
burned down.

15:33.291 --> 15:34.709
-No!
-Now do you see?

15:35.917 --> 15:38.417
I can't take it, Carla. I cannot
hide the crazy a minute longer.

15:38.917 --> 15:42.083
And the worst part is,
Paul is this sweet, perfect guy

15:42.166 --> 15:43.792
who actually wants to
take things slow with me,

15:43.875 --> 15:46.041
and I'm just this big mountain
of koo-koo who's about to erupt

15:46.125 --> 15:47.417
and spew molten crazy all over
him,

15:47.500 --> 15:48.750
and he's gonna die like this.

15:49.291 --> 15:50.667
Calm down, Elliot.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.959
Do what I used to do.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.583
Find people who
don't even know Paul

15:53.667 --> 15:55.667
and then just let it out
in little bursts.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.542
Good afternoon, ladies.

16:00.083 --> 16:01.834
You know, when I was a kid
I got a sunburn like that

16:01.917 --> 16:03.542
and I just peeled
all the skin off,

16:03.625 --> 16:04.709
put it in a pile,
and ate it.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.041
Good lord.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.875
(J.D.) <i>For us, it was time to</i>
<i>face the Karma music.</i>

16:13.542 --> 16:15.417
We were the ones that hit your
car with that golf ball.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500
Well, technically,
it was Dr. Turk.

16:17.583 --> 16:20.000
You... liar, okay? It was you.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.333
You know what?
It really doesn't matter.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.750
What were you guys doin' hitting
golf balls way downtown?

16:25.834 --> 16:27.208
Downtown!

16:27.959 --> 16:29.542
I told you it wasn't us.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.667
You know, this is almost exactly
like the kind of picnics

16:35.750 --> 16:37.208
I had with my mother.

16:37.291 --> 16:38.709
You're so cute.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.542
And now,
it's exactly like 'em.

16:44.041 --> 16:45.375
You got somethin'
in your tooth.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.583
(Eliot) <i>I can't believe I have</i>
<i>something on my teeth.</i>

16:47.667 --> 16:49.208
<i>Get it off. Get it off.</i>
<i>Get it off.</i>

16:49.291 --> 16:50.625
<i>Get it off. Get it off!!</i>

16:50.709 --> 16:52.333
Did I get it?

16:52.417 --> 16:54.333
Uh, no,
but don't worry about it.

16:54.417 --> 16:55.750
So, anyway, I was thinkin'--

16:56.792 --> 16:58.125
Elliot...

16:58.208 --> 16:59.625
Elliot,
is everything all right?

16:59.709 --> 17:01.041
(smack)

17:01.125 --> 17:02.542
Everything's great, yeah.

17:03.667 --> 17:04.667
Come here.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
What?

17:08.583 --> 17:10.083
I--it's just, well...

17:10.542 --> 17:12.291
This is what bothered me
the other night

17:12.375 --> 17:13.959
'cause I know that
there's somethin' wrong,

17:14.041 --> 17:15.625
but you won't talk about it.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.166
I guess sometimes it feels
like you're holdin' back.

17:20.834 --> 17:23.542
Of course I'm holding back.
I'm insane, you idiot.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.917
Remember the other day when you
told me that I had pit stains,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.375
well, I have cried every 15
minutes on the half hour

17:28.458 --> 17:30.208
since you told me that.
I am racked with self-doubt,

17:30.291 --> 17:32.208
I have panic attacks,
I'm claustrophobic, germophobic,

17:32.291 --> 17:34.875
phobiophobic, I talk to myself,
I talk to my cat,

17:34.959 --> 17:37.291
I talk to 3 separate shrinks
about the fact

17:37.375 --> 17:39.959
that often my cats respond to me
in my mother's voice

17:40.041 --> 17:43.291
and, yesterday, when that
stupid, pretty surgical nurse

17:43.375 --> 17:44.875
handed you a pair
of latex gloves,

17:44.959 --> 17:46.625
I almost killed the guy whose
leg I was stitching up

17:46.709 --> 17:48.583
because I couldn't stop thinking
about the two of you

17:48.667 --> 17:50.250
having sex
on a box of steaks.

17:50.625 --> 17:51.625
Why a box of steaks?

17:51.709 --> 17:54.000
'Cause my dad had an affair
with a female butcher,

17:54.083 --> 17:56.083
and, as I mentioned before,
I am insane.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.083
There, I opened up.
Are you happy?

17:58.750 --> 17:59.917
No.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.291
I'm incredibly turned on.

18:07.458 --> 18:09.375
I gotta, uh, get this
thing out of my teeth.

18:10.709 --> 18:11.709
Excuse me.

18:11.792 --> 18:14.583
-(thud, crash)
-Ow! I'm okay.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.000
I still believe in Karma,

18:16.083 --> 18:18.417
and if I wasn't being
punished for Mr. Golf ball,

18:18.500 --> 18:20.834
I think I knew where my bad
Karma was coming from.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.667
I don't know that many straight
guys that wear Cologne.

18:24.291 --> 18:25.500
I'm down to one spritz.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.333
Look, Dr. Cox asked me
to check in on you.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.166
I'm sorry I haven't
been here until now.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.208
He asked you to check in on me?

18:33.291 --> 18:34.375
Yep.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.041
So...

18:36.750 --> 18:37.834
How ya doin'?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.417
Well, I've ruined everything.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.333
All he tried to do
was take care of me

18:42.417 --> 18:43.625
and show me
that he loved me,

18:43.709 --> 18:45.375
but, no,
I had to drive him away

18:45.458 --> 18:47.083
because I don't like being
vulnerable,

18:47.166 --> 18:48.250
even when I'm normal,

18:48.333 --> 18:50.458
let alone with
my ankles in stirrups

18:50.542 --> 18:52.291
and my coochie on display.

18:52.375 --> 18:54.458
So now he's
gone away for good,

18:54.542 --> 18:56.959
and I would really like to get
this stupid thing out of me

18:57.041 --> 18:58.834
so I can go home
and kill myself.

18:58.917 --> 19:00.667
Well, you sound good.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.417
I was going to tell him the
truth, eventually.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.166
I just wanted to see if he was
going to be with me

19:05.250 --> 19:07.667
because he wanted to,
not because he had to.

19:08.542 --> 19:09.709
Do you know what I mean?

19:09.792 --> 19:11.208
What are you talking about?

19:11.291 --> 19:13.875
It's his baby, stupid.
Don't tell anyone.

19:13.959 --> 19:15.250
All right,

19:15.333 --> 19:17.500
kappa gamma here says it's time
to get this thing underway,

19:17.583 --> 19:19.250
so I don't care if you
want me here or not,

19:19.333 --> 19:21.166
I'm... I'm stayin'.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.625
Whatever. All right.

19:22.709 --> 19:23.834
Good.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.166
What were you two talkin' about?

19:29.709 --> 19:30.875
Apartheid.

19:31.542 --> 19:33.792
-It's wrong.
-Oh.

19:33.875 --> 19:34.959
Call me "new agey,"

19:35.041 --> 19:37.208
but I think Karma's
a powerful force.

19:39.083 --> 19:40.333
I honestly don't know

19:40.417 --> 19:43.834
what put the idea of golfin'
on the roof in my head.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.834
Dude, it is so nice
out here.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.333
You mind if I take it down
to the banana hammock?

19:48.917 --> 19:50.333
(J.D.)
<i>Because, I honestly believe,</i>

19:50.417 --> 19:52.208
<i>if you've got some bad Karma</i>
<i>comin' your way,</i>

19:52.291 --> 19:53.291
<i>well...</i>

19:53.625 --> 19:54.625
Hi, Dr. Kelso.

19:54.709 --> 19:56.083
(J.D.)
<i>You can't hide from it.</i>

20:01.625 --> 20:03.875
(J.D.) <i>Karma is really just about</i>
<i>doin' the right thing.</i>

20:03.959 --> 20:07.166
Anyway, Mr. Simms,

20:07.250 --> 20:09.667
I wanted to explain to you
why your chest was hurting.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.083
During surgery, I...

20:12.458 --> 20:14.959
(J.D.) <i>Or about being</i>
<i>who you really are.</i>

20:16.291 --> 20:18.417
<i>Either way, it's a lot</i>
<i>to think about.</i>

20:18.500 --> 20:21.500
Oh, my God, would you look at
the mug on Jordan's baby?

20:22.291 --> 20:24.208
Must have one butt-ugly father.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.625
Heh. Yeah.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.125
(J.D.) <i>Damn you, Karma.</i>
