WEBVTT

00:03.462 --> 00:06.548
And that is Hera.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.427
Incredible. I am blown away.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.471
-Thanks. Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.182
If your game is half as exciting
as that pitch, we'd love to invest.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.142
-What?
-This is just a vertical slice.

00:17.226 --> 00:19.228
So the full game
will be much more impressive.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.188
Amazing. You two have built the--

00:21.271 --> 00:22.481
Model prisoner.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.192
You have a spotless record.
You volunteered in the library.

00:26.485 --> 00:30.280
You even taught classes in finance
to prepare other inmates for their parole.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.031
-Yeah.
-Honestly, Mr. Bakshi,

00:32.115 --> 00:33.408
it's a shame to lose you.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.327
No, I don't think you're gonna lose me.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.707
No, but seriously,
I sit before you a changed man.

00:40.791 --> 00:41.792
We see that.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.671
You are proof that reform is possible,
because prisons only work when--

00:45.754 --> 00:47.840
Costs are down, numbers are up.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.174
Excellent work, David.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.801
Thank you, Jacques and Jean-Luc.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.511
Yeah, I can't take all the credit.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.346
As we know, it takes a village,

00:54.429 --> 00:56.932
and I think these prof reports
will show you

00:57.015 --> 00:59.268
just how well this village was run.

00:59.351 --> 01:02.354
Streamlined, responsible. It is--

01:02.437 --> 01:05.566
The most complex game engine
ever conceived.

01:05.649 --> 01:06.692
This is our masterpiece.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.570
Yes, and we are solely focused on the now.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.154
So forget about our past--

01:11.238 --> 01:12.364
Indiscretions.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.367
If you give me another chance,
I swear I will never--

01:15.450 --> 01:18.203
Toot my own horn.
I'll let the numbers do that for me.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.288
But the truth is--

01:19.371 --> 01:20.205
I am--

01:20.289 --> 01:21.331
Way better off--

01:21.415 --> 01:23.000
-Without them.
-Damn straight.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.293
-Jo.
-Sorry.

01:25.002 --> 01:28.380
Now, let's talk about our future.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.781
How long do we wait?

01:58.076 --> 02:00.537
How long are we supposed to wait?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.039
Ian!

02:03.999 --> 02:06.668
-Are you talking to me?
-Who else would I be talking to?

02:06.752 --> 02:08.711
You're the only other person
that works in this office.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.422
Can you get off the stupid VR game?

02:10.506 --> 02:14.343
I'm not playing a stupid VR game, Poppy.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.594
I am navigating,

02:15.677 --> 02:18.972
and quite possibly building,
a very small subsection of the Metaverse.

02:19.056 --> 02:22.559
No, no.
No more speeches about the Web3 frontier

02:22.643 --> 02:26.897
-and "non-fungal tokens."
-Non-fungible. Non-fungible.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.983
Which means "unable to be replaced
by an identical item."

02:30.067 --> 02:32.653
Much like your kidneys,
but keep drinking that green soda.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.031
I saw you injecting yourself
with horse hormones this morning.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.992
Okay. First of all,
those were amino acids, and secondly--

02:39.576 --> 02:41.161
Shut up, shut up. Their offer's come in.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.914
-They've emailed their offer. Yeah.
-Really? That was fast.

02:43.997 --> 02:44.998
That's a good sign.

02:48.544 --> 02:52.339
Okay, before we open this,
I think we should make a pact.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.217
-Okay.
-We don't take less than 25.

02:56.343 --> 03:00.931
Twenty-five is what we asked for,
and that's what they have to pay.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.058
I like this Poppy.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.768
Go big or don't go. Twenty-five it is.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.854
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.149
"Ian and Poppy, everyone is buzzing
over your presentation…"

03:11.233 --> 03:12.234
Blah, blah, blah.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.028
"…excited to move forward
with an offer of 50 million."

03:16.029 --> 03:17.030
Fifty million?

03:20.325 --> 03:21.368
Is this real?

03:25.372 --> 03:26.456
Yeah.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.676
-This is my dream.
-Yes!

03:37.759 --> 03:40.345
-This is the greatest day of my life!
-Yes.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.222
-And we did it! We really did it!
-Yes!

03:42.306 --> 03:46.435
We just made $50 million!

03:46.518 --> 03:47.603
No.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.272
What?

03:50.355 --> 03:54.568
We didn't make $50 million
because we're not gonna take the money.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.113
What? What?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.658
-But we asked for 25…
-Right.

04:01.742 --> 04:06.288
-…and they offered us 50.
-Correct.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.583
But we're not gonna take it?

04:10.167 --> 04:11.585
No.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.212
No.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.464
No.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.298
No, no, no.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.095
Yes.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.517
Look, Pop, there are reasons
to take the money.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.684
There are reasons not to.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.395
It just doesn't feel right in my gut.

04:31.522 --> 04:32.606
Your gut?

04:33.982 --> 04:34.983
Your g--

04:35.734 --> 04:39.530
We spent all our seed money on this game,

04:39.613 --> 04:42.199
in this stupid spaceship office.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.910
I've been struggling to pay my rent,

04:44.993 --> 04:50.999
but we're not gonna take double
what we asked for because of your gut?

04:52.584 --> 04:55.587
Did you want me to say "yes" again, or
can you infer based on the conversation?

04:55.671 --> 04:58.423
Your gut is always making these decisions.

04:58.507 --> 05:03.136
You said that we would make
GrimPop Studios to develop my game!

05:03.220 --> 05:07.641
So this is not for your gut to decide.
My gut is making this call.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.604
You're right. You're totally right.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.648
This is your game,
and you should make the call.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.568
So what do you wanna do?

05:18.777 --> 05:20.487
I think that we should take the money.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.823
You think we should take it?

05:23.657 --> 05:24.741
I wanna take the money!

05:24.825 --> 05:27.411
Take the money?
Okay. That's a lot of money.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.704
-Yes!
-All right. Let's take it.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.497
-Yes!
-All right. Good call.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.165
-Congrats, Pop.
-Okay.

05:34.710 --> 05:38.839
Take the money. It's a big win.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.884
That's a big win, Poppy.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.979
And I do

05:54.813 --> 05:56.857
Don't know this part

05:57.858 --> 06:00.485
And pretend it was you

06:00.986 --> 06:04.239
And lose control

06:04.823 --> 06:08.410
There'll be some lovemaking
Heartbreaking

06:12.998 --> 06:15.834
-Soul-shaking
-Soul-shaking love

06:15.918 --> 06:18.712
Lovemaking
Heartbreaking

06:18.795 --> 06:20.088
-So--
-Ugh.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.381
Jo.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.717
She's just gonna keep calling.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.221
-Hi, Jo.
-Where are you?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.306
Good to hear your voice too.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.390
We're on the 5.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.518
We just left San Francisco,
and we are en route.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.853
You just left?
You're gonna be late for C.W.'s party.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.355
He's flying in from Europe for this.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.148
If he can make it here on time,
so can you.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.484
Sorry. Rach got hungry,
so we stopped to get a muffin.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.110
I don't wanna hear
what you put your muff in.

06:42.194 --> 06:43.654
-Why?
-Ew, Jo. Ugh!

06:43.737 --> 06:45.405
Why you-- are so gross all the time?

06:45.489 --> 06:47.908
I promised C.W. I would get everybody here
by seven o'clock sharp.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.826
As in if you aren't here on time,

06:49.910 --> 06:52.829
I will cut you with something sharp.
Goodbye.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.838
Carol's got issues.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.340
Don't get me wrong, things are good.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.300
I got a new job title, and a raise,

07:05.384 --> 07:08.220
and they backed that
ol' dump truck up against Carol's house,

07:08.303 --> 07:11.056
but I don't do anything.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.684
Then again,
I've been underpaid my whole life,

07:13.767 --> 07:16.854
so if these dumbass French Canadians
wanna give me beaucoup bucks

07:16.937 --> 07:18.146
for doing nothing,

07:18.230 --> 07:19.982
then I should just take it, right?

07:21.483 --> 07:23.735
I don't know. What do you think?

07:25.028 --> 07:28.115
I think you jump from the first
to third person too often.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.908
It's hard to follow.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.660
Mr. Brittlesbee is very busy.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.495
If you're mentally ill,
I'd be more than happy

07:33.579 --> 07:35.622
-to drive you to a nearby asylum.
-Jo, please.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.208
Carol, look, you're more valuable
to this company than ever.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.294
Montreal made you
Head of Diversity and Inclusion.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.920
I don't even know what that means.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.924
I'm just trying to justify a job
where I'm overpaid but do nothing.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.176
How do you do it, David?

07:48.093 --> 07:50.762
Me? I do a lot.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.682
I-- Carol, I manage the crazy creatives.

07:53.765 --> 07:57.227
I'm producing significant content
for a massive video game.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.437
The crazy creatives are gone.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.939
We aren't really producing
any more significant content.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.941
Still. I do a lot.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.402
My days are filled with endless meetings.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.154
And you have C.W.'s event tonight.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.238
Yes. Thank you, Jo.

08:08.322 --> 08:11.033
C.W., who's returning
from his yearlong, whirlwind book tour,

08:11.116 --> 08:13.327
is hosting an event tonight.
Everyone's gonna be there.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.037
And guess who has to manage it all?

08:15.621 --> 08:17.873
Me. I had to organize the entire event.

08:18.457 --> 08:19.666
Yes, but I manage you.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.668
-Jo, can you get me some tea, please?
-Of course.

08:21.752 --> 08:22.794
You see, Carol,

08:23.337 --> 08:27.633
this corporation is
a complex system of operations that--

08:27.716 --> 08:30.344
Okay, she's gone.
Yes. My job is basically nonexistent.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.388
All I do is tread water,
and just hope that nobody notices.

08:33.472 --> 08:36.390
See? I knew it. I'm getting a peek
behind the white curtain.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.476
Thank you, David.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.809
It's not a white or Black thing.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.230
It's a red tape thing,
and I've been navigating it for years.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.816
I can help you, but I'm gonna need
a little bit more information.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.110
Did they give you
any actual responsibilities?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.946
-No.
-And who do you report to?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.030
No one.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.406
-And what's your budget?
-Nothing.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.116
Yeah. That's right on track.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.701
David, what is happening?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.496
You're a figurehead. Yeah.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.999
You're given just enough resources
and power to make zero impact.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.920
Your job is to provide cover.
Maintain the status quo.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.171
It feels empty,

09:06.255 --> 09:09.091
but they give you that salary,
and it fills that hole in your soul.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.884
Carol has always wanted golden handcuffs.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.679
It is a conundrum.
David wrestles with it every day.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.722
-It don't work when you do it.
-I thought I had it.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.182
-No, you do not.
-Yeah? All right.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.893
Either way, if you wanna keep that gold,

09:19.977 --> 09:21.812
you gotta move those papers around,

09:22.312 --> 09:23.856
fill your calendar with meetings.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.108
I like to call it the "hokey-pokey,"
right?

09:26.191 --> 09:28.443
You put your right foot in.
You put your right foot out.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.611
You turn it all about.

09:29.695 --> 09:30.696
You do the hokey-pokey,

09:30.779 --> 09:32.531
but you always stay
in the exact same place.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.199
-You do not move, right?
-Okay.

09:34.283 --> 09:37.870
I do feel like we've talked
about everything we need to.

09:37.953 --> 09:40.539
So, why don't you
get back to me with your progress?

09:40.622 --> 09:41.748
-Sounds good.
-Productive talk.

09:41.832 --> 09:43.667
Why don't we put a weekly meeting
in the calendar?

09:43.750 --> 09:47.004
In the calendar.
All right. I'm gonna get back to work.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.130
Back to work.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.757
-Here's your tea, boss.
-Thank you, Jo.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.968
You have a meeting in five minutes, boss.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.053
I sure do.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.765
Poppy?

10:00.017 --> 10:01.018
Poppy?

10:02.644 --> 10:03.645
Where are you?

10:04.146 --> 10:07.107
We're gonna have to leave soon
if we wanna make C.W.'s thing tonight.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.695
Jo won't stop texting me just to confirm
that we're actually coming.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.489
These losers are so desperate to see us.
It's pathetic.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.158
Poppy, where are you?

10:16.241 --> 10:17.242
I'm in here.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.746
-Where's here?
-The bathroom.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.291
Where is the bathroom?
I can never find this damn thing.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.961
You're the one that didn't want lines
anywhere in the office.

10:28.045 --> 10:32.049
Poppy, lines are so Web1.
You don't wanna be in Web1, do you?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.051
I have no idea.
What web are we in right now?

10:34.134 --> 10:37.262
The whole office is outfit for Web3,

10:37.346 --> 10:40.724
but most of the world
is in Web2 transitioning to Web3.

10:40.807 --> 10:44.228
If I have to be honest,
I'd say I'm actually Web4.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.480
-Metaphorically speaking, of course.
-Wow, okay.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.566
The toilet's clogged so call
the Imagineers to come flush my shit.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.654
Hey, are you okay?
You were in there for a really long time.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.615
Yeah. My gut is not good.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.493
I really thought that taking the money
was the right call,

10:59.576 --> 11:01.870
but then I thought,
"This morning I thought

11:01.954 --> 11:04.498
that taking 25 was the right call,
and that would've been the wrong call.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.583
So maybe we should hold out
for more money,"

11:06.667 --> 11:09.378
but then I thought,
"What if I was right about the 25?

11:09.962 --> 11:12.589
And holding out
is only gonna give them more time

11:12.673 --> 11:14.466
to realize that they made a mistake."

11:14.550 --> 11:17.344
And so we should just take it, right?

11:17.427 --> 11:19.847
But then I thought,
"It's not even really about the money.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.974
It's about finding the right partner
to work with."

11:22.057 --> 11:24.768
And I don't wanna work with someone
that offered 50

11:24.852 --> 11:26.353
but only thinks that we're worth 25.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.231
And that's when I had to run to the
bathroom and have explosive diarrhea.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.860
Wow. Okay.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.611
So anyway,

11:34.695 --> 11:37.030
I think it's good because
now our guts agree.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.533
We should not take the money.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.995
Yeah, sorry.
Now my gut's telling me to take it.

11:43.078 --> 11:43.996
-What?
-Yeah.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.331
My gut is telling me
we should definitely take the money.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.083
But just yesterday
you said that we shouldn't.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.751
But that was yesterday.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.211
A whole day has passed since then.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.089
Yes, I know how days work.

11:54.173 --> 11:57.009
What I don't understand
is how you can be so sure of something

11:57.092 --> 11:59.386
when you believed the exact opposite
the day before.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.472
Yesterday I was right too.

12:02.556 --> 12:07.144
It's only now that I realize yesterday
I was wrong, but I'm right today.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.478
That's insane.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.898
Maybe, but I've always led by my gut.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.150
But what if you make the wrong call?

12:13.775 --> 12:14.860
It can't be the wrong call.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.070
It might not be the call
that yields the best result,

12:17.154 --> 12:18.363
but that doesn't make it wrong.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.991
Look, take these people for example:

12:21.074 --> 12:25.162
Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt,
Nelson Mandela, Henry Ford.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.540
These are leaders who listened
to their inner voice and made a call.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.834
Then they let the chips fall
where they may.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.922
If your gut is right 51% of the time,
that's a good gut.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.176
You gotta be kidding me.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.428
I cannot believe I am listening to a man

12:41.512 --> 12:43.847
who thinks he belongs on the same wall
as Mother Teresa.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.558
You don't like Mother Teresa?
What's wrong with you?

12:46.642 --> 12:49.102
No, I'm saying that you-- shouldn't be--

12:49.186 --> 12:52.523
Look, Poppy, it doesn't matter
what I believe about myself.

12:52.606 --> 12:57.319
What matters
is what you believe about yourself.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.490
And my gut tells me that you belong
on that wall.

13:04.243 --> 13:05.244
What does yours say?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.640
-Hi, Jo.
-Where are you?

13:27.266 --> 13:28.475
We're close.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.603
We got hung up in Central California.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.147
C.W.'s currently over the
South Pacific Ocean and closing in fast.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.983
-How do you know that?
-I'm tracking him.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.067
He set up an app--

13:37.150 --> 13:39.111
I don't have to explain myself.
Explain yourselves!

13:39.194 --> 13:40.571
We got pulled over.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.155
You're getting a speeding ticket?

13:42.239 --> 13:44.783
We were.
But then Rachel got into it with the cop.

13:44.867 --> 13:49.246
I was ju--
I spoke a little truth to power.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.331
And now he's running our plates.

13:51.415 --> 13:52.457
Give me to him.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.626
-I'm sorry?
-Hand him the phone.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.633
Officer? Excuse me.

14:01.717 --> 14:02.718
Yeah.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.139
Our friend wants to talk to you
for a second.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.018
Hello?

14:11.101 --> 14:12.102
Seems weird.

14:16.565 --> 14:17.983
-Sorry. I--
-He has a gun.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.693
I know he has a gun.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.447
And I just thought I was being helpful,
'cause he was being a little rude.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.657
And now I'm realizing
that was very ill-advised.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.910
I'm just very sorry.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.203
Here.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.330
You're free to go.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.834
That's some Illuminati shit.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.671
Let's go.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.508
Let's go and never talk about this again.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.344
Hey, David, you got a minute?

14:45.427 --> 14:46.428
Several, yeah.

14:46.512 --> 14:49.431
I'm just walking the halls at a brisk pace
to give the appearance I'm busy.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.225
-Pro tip.
-Thanks.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.143
So, I was thinking about
what you were saying.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.729
-About treading water?
-Ripples, not waves, baby.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.732
Yeah, but the thing is,
I really do wanna make a difference.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.859
Yeah, we all do.
And hopefully, someday we will,

15:00.943 --> 15:04.029
but until then just hokey-pokey, Carol.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.532
Actually, I had an idea.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.326
Or should I say, one came into my office,
and I hired him.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.497
-That's kind of a big move.
-No. No. Small salary.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.668
And I'm giving an opportunity to someone
from a traditionally marginalized group.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.379
Yeah. Okay, great.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.924
Yeah, you managed to pokey
while still effecting change. Bravo.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.008
Thank you.

15:25.509 --> 15:28.136
Now I'd like to introduce you
to our newest employee.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.263
Hello, David.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.310
Brad? What are you doing here?

15:35.394 --> 15:36.562
Carol hired me.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.021
No, no. No.

15:38.105 --> 15:41.650
I'm sorry,
but we cannot rehire an employee

15:41.733 --> 15:44.528
who's been convicted for insider trading
to be our Head of Monetization.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.572
He's not. He's our new janitor.

15:46.655 --> 15:47.739
I'm excited to get cleaning.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.450
Okay.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.245
What? What's your angle?

15:53.871 --> 15:55.497
There's no angles. I've gone straight.

15:55.581 --> 15:58.083
Please. Look at your body.
You're all angles.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.919
David, look, I've paid my dues.
I've recognized the error of my ways,

16:01.003 --> 16:04.673
and I'm just trying to enter back
into society honestly as a reformed man.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.676
And as a brown felon,
which is two for the price of one.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.971
Or really, two for the price of half,
because we get a subsidy for hiring him.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.432
-So, doing good, saving cash.
-Love a good coupon.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.017
Look, David, I know you don't trust me.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.895
It's gonna be a process,
but I just hope to earn your trust

16:17.978 --> 16:19.438
one clean urinal at a time.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.814
C.W.'s getting here any minute.

16:23.901 --> 16:26.278
-Hello.
-Hello.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.155
I'm reformed now.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.032
So am I.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.451
-I'm working a menial job at Mythic Quest.
-So am I.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.703
Menial? She's my assistant, to be clear.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.205
-Good.
-Good.

16:36.288 --> 16:40.209
To that I say, "Great."
I'ma put this on the website.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.295
'Cause that's what it's all about

17:00.062 --> 17:01.063
Wow.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.900
It's really strange to be back
after all this time, isn't it?

17:04.983 --> 17:05.983
Yeah.

17:06.068 --> 17:09.738
Yeah, it's kinda like
when you go visit a childhood home

17:09.820 --> 17:13.617
and you're different but it's the same?
And it just kinda feels smaller.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.327
-Yeah, it feels smaller, doesn't it?
-Yeah.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.496
Well, well, well.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.333
David, it is nice to see you.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.251
Is it?

17:23.335 --> 17:25.295
MQ's doing well
and probably stings a little bit.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.798
I know you guys didn't think
I could do it.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.299
No-- No, no, we--

17:29.383 --> 17:31.510
We literally
haven't said your name in a year.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.720
Yeah. In fact, when I think about you,

17:33.804 --> 17:35.472
-all I feel is--
-Jealousy?

17:35.973 --> 17:37.224
-No.
-Rage?

17:37.307 --> 17:38.976
-No.
-Sad?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.894
-No.
-Wistful?

17:40.978 --> 17:42.896
-Apathy? Yeah.
-I'm-- Yeah, apathy.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.606
So, I guess you can't really feel apathy.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.483
-It's sort of a lack of feeling.
-Ditto.

17:47.442 --> 17:51.238
I don't feel that way--
Or not feel that way… either.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.657
And frankly,
you guys would just drag us down.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.952
The way we are running right now
you wouldn't recognize the place.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.204
We got a new staff.
We got a whole new culture.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.373
It's completely different.

18:01.874 --> 18:04.501
-Hey, guys. Nice to see you again.
-Hey, Brad. You out of prison?

18:04.585 --> 18:06.211
Yeah. Working here again.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.548
-Looks the same to me.
-Okay, yeah.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.466
You guys have it all figured out,
don't you?

18:11.550 --> 18:14.428
You're the cool, sexy mavericks
who are changing the world.

18:14.511 --> 18:19.224
Kind of. I'll have you know that we
just took a $50 million investment.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.560
And shoved it up their asses.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.853
Now that's a little confusing.

18:22.936 --> 18:27.316
We took a $25 million offer that we had
and we shoved that up their asses,

18:27.399 --> 18:30.819
-but $50 million is what we actually took.
-No. I turned the 50 million down.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.282
-You turned down $50 million?
-Actually, I turned down $60 million,

18:35.365 --> 18:37.242
which is what they countered with
after I passed.

18:37.326 --> 18:38.327
You would've loved it.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.288
I told them to "suck my duck,"
which obviously isn't what I meant,

18:41.371 --> 18:42.539
but autocorrect boned me.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.210
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.754
-Even after we discussed--
-We said we weren't gonna take it.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.589
No. We said we were gonna take it,
because--

18:50.672 --> 18:53.133
-My gut said "turn it down". My gut…
-But your gut fucking sucks.

18:53.217 --> 18:55.302
Seems like you two
have it all figured out.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.262
-I said tomorrow, my gut…
-All right, look.

18:57.346 --> 19:00.057
There are no lines in the office, David.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.975
-We're here!
-We made it! We're here.

19:02.935 --> 19:05.103
Hooray. Why don't you sit down?
He's almost here.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.819
Hi, everybody. Long time no see.

19:12.903 --> 19:16.365
-Who are you?
-That's funny.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.201
Are you serious?

19:19.284 --> 19:21.453
-Hey, I'm Ian Grimm.
-I know.

19:21.537 --> 19:23.747
-This is my girlfriend, Rachel.
-Hey, Dana.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.541
-Hey. How's it going?
-You've gotta be kidding me.

19:25.624 --> 19:27.501
Everyone, shut up. Shut up.

19:28.627 --> 19:32.047
I have strict instructions from C.W.
that at exactly 8:15,

19:32.130 --> 19:33.841
I am to deliver this letter to David.

19:33.924 --> 19:34.758
Me?

19:36.677 --> 19:37.678
Okay.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.056
In 20 more seconds.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.224
Seriously?

19:42.307 --> 19:44.935
-He was very precise.
-Okay.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.521
-David, I have a question.
-You don't have to raise your hand.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.731
-Where's C.W.?
-I don't know where he is.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.317
-He's not showing up for his own party?
-I don't know.

19:52.401 --> 19:54.736
Does he think we're just gonna sit here
and wait for him?

19:55.529 --> 19:57.948
She called my name, I came up.
That's all I know.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.908
We don't have time for this.
We should just go, right?

19:59.992 --> 20:01.326
-Yeah. Let's just go.
-I'm gonna go too.

20:01.410 --> 20:06.415
-We didn't wanna come in the first place.
-Three, two, one. Read.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.001
He's not even showing up
to his own party? This is bizarre.

20:09.084 --> 20:11.420
"If you're hearing these words,
I am already dead."

20:14.715 --> 20:16.300
Wait, what?

20:16.383 --> 20:19.136
"That's right.
Dead as Dillinger, daddy-o."

20:21.305 --> 20:22.347
Come on.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.309
I don't know. I'm just reading it.

20:25.893 --> 20:27.269
Keep going.

20:29.605 --> 20:33.567
"Some time ago I was given
a rather unfortunate prognosis,

20:33.650 --> 20:37.070
and I decided to script the conclusion
of my own story.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.866
In a moment,
I shall climb into a Ford Thunderbird

20:40.949 --> 20:43.035
and drive off into the Grand Canyon,

20:43.744 --> 20:48.248
knowing I ended my story like no other.
A true original."

20:49.082 --> 20:50.709
That's the end of Thelma and Louise.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.753
"My remains will be retrieved,

20:52.836 --> 20:56.131
placed into a satellite,
and launched into space.

20:56.215 --> 21:01.011
Josephine has unwittingly been tracking
my celestial path across the globe,

21:01.094 --> 21:04.348
and soon I will be directly above you
in the night sky."

21:05.015 --> 21:07.267
Wait. Wait, wait a second.
This is bullshit.

21:07.351 --> 21:09.394
He's in a satellite, David?

21:09.478 --> 21:13.607
Again, I am just reading the piece
of paper that was just handed to me.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.484
-But this is fucking nuts.
-This is crazy.

21:15.567 --> 21:18.612
-He didn't actually do this, right?
-It's C.W. Who knows?

21:18.695 --> 21:21.448
-Is he actually dead?
-Yeah, David, is he really dead?

21:21.532 --> 21:22.616
I don't know.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.494
I am experiencing this with you
at the same time.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.788
-Is there more?
-Let's find out together, shall we?

21:29.915 --> 21:32.626
"I do apologize
for keeping you in the dark,

21:32.709 --> 21:33.961
but like any great story,

21:34.044 --> 21:38.423
mine had to be unexpected and inevitable
at the same time.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.219
I stole that line
from a writer I once knew.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.763
I stole a lot of things.

21:45.430 --> 21:49.726
But worse than that, I let my hubris
convince me that I didn't need friends.

21:50.352 --> 21:53.188
That success was the only thing
that mattered.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.649
That I was better off alone.

21:56.525 --> 21:58.026
I was wrong.

21:58.110 --> 22:02.906
And if I had to do it all over again,
I wouldn't change a thing.

22:03.782 --> 22:08.745
Because that mistake led me to you,
my MQ family.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.331
You gave me a second chance,

22:11.415 --> 22:15.669
and the friendship I had with you has been
the greatest success of my life.

22:19.173 --> 22:22.634
Do not weep for me,
for I go to my rest as so few men do.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.679
Content.

22:27.514 --> 22:33.937
So, if I may, one final word of advice.

22:35.147 --> 22:37.274
Hold onto each other
for as long as you can…

22:39.735 --> 22:40.861
'cause that's all there is."

23:00.506 --> 23:03.425
It's time. We're supposed to look up now.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.014
There!

23:26.573 --> 23:27.991
You know what that old bitch said?

23:28.075 --> 23:32.037
He actually had the temerity to say
that leaving copies of Swank

23:32.120 --> 23:35.040
all over his desk
was his First Amendment right.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.584
Gross.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.336
And weird.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.296
What does C.W. call this drink again?

23:41.380 --> 23:42.881
It's called a Rutger Hauer.

23:42.965 --> 23:45.801
It's all about getting the right
coffee-to-cough-syrup ratio.

23:45.884 --> 23:46.718
Cough syrup?

23:47.594 --> 23:50.639
Maybe that's why he was always drunk,
wired, and never sick.

23:52.266 --> 23:53.308
Crazy old bitch.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.853
Anybody want some more?

23:56.687 --> 23:57.688
No.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.690
It's getting kinda late.

23:59.773 --> 24:02.150
Yeah. We should probably head back
to our place.

24:02.234 --> 24:04.069
-You're calling it?
-Yeah.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.279
Yeah.

24:07.906 --> 24:08.949
All right.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.452
Weird day.

24:22.296 --> 24:24.006
Goodbye, again.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.136
It was actually
kinda nice seeing you again.

24:29.970 --> 24:30.971
Yeah, it was.

24:32.014 --> 24:34.558
Maybe we do it more often?

24:34.641 --> 24:36.018
Yeah, yeah. Maybe we will.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.563
Bye.
