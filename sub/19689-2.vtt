00:00.033 --> 00:01.835
Previously on Underground...

00:01.867 --> 00:03.988
This rescue gonna be the
toughest thing you ever done.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.854
- Where's Noah?!
- They took him.

00:09.887 --> 00:11.777
You sad, pretty little thing.

00:11.811 --> 00:14.117
This your life now?

00:14.913 --> 00:16.082
Just kill yourself.

00:16.114 --> 00:17.683
Welcome to the sewing circle.

00:17.716 --> 00:20.387
We aim to incite good people to action.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.388
There is an open seat

00:21.420 --> 00:22.521
on the Court of Commons.

00:22.554 --> 00:23.722
We put my name on the ballot,

00:23.756 --> 00:24.899
and then I can start making rulings

00:24.923 --> 00:26.326
that'll help the cause.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.728
John Hawkes!

00:43.643 --> 00:45.712
What you doin'

00:45.744 --> 00:47.212
back here so early?

00:47.246 --> 00:48.448
I want to show you somethin'.

01:10.969 --> 01:12.638
Did you just...

01:12.671 --> 01:13.911
I been teachin' myself to read.

01:14.517 --> 01:16.120
And writin', it's just...

01:16.213 --> 01:18.583
drawin' the sounds that the words make.

01:19.683 --> 01:21.386
What it say?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.585
It say how I feel about you.

01:27.646 --> 01:30.290
It say why I taught myself to do this.

01:30.322 --> 01:32.110
It say...

01:34.126 --> 01:35.628
"love."

01:42.440 --> 01:43.998
It's amazing.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.941
I want to keep it forever.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.718
But this could get us killed.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.962
Where is everybody?!

02:20.706 --> 02:22.841
Somebody help!

03:00.354 --> 03:01.710
The wagon's ready.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.104
You gonna need a teaspoon
of this twice a day.

03:04.790 --> 03:06.759
Keep that infection off.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.694
His bandage fresh, but he gonna need

03:08.728 --> 03:10.163
a change once you gets to Ripley.

03:10.195 --> 03:12.331
It's right there. I put
some jewelweed in here, too.

03:12.365 --> 03:14.833
I know a doctor there
who's a friend of the cause.

03:14.867 --> 03:16.579
- Valentine will be in good hands.
- We gonna have to get movin'.

03:16.603 --> 03:18.613
Whoever done this to John might
know this house is a station.

03:18.637 --> 03:21.300
If they're brazen enough to
target John in broad daylight,

03:21.332 --> 03:23.843
- they'd have already stormed the house.
- We got to notify

03:23.875 --> 03:25.183
- them other stations.
- Wires went out this morning.

03:25.207 --> 03:27.780
There's a hold on all cargo
for the next two days.

03:27.814 --> 03:30.876
Well, then that mean
Moses gonna be stuck in Ripley.

03:30.909 --> 03:33.385
Ain't no way she gonna make
the train by the week's end.

03:33.419 --> 03:35.755
Moses will find a way.

03:35.788 --> 03:39.725
Rosalee, right now you got
to focus on your family.

03:40.071 --> 03:42.828
Elizabeth is going to need you.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.137
It's not a plan yet, not by a long shot,

03:48.171 --> 03:50.112
but it's got the makings of one.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.575
The furrier's boat leavin'
in three days' time,

03:52.607 --> 03:54.309
but it's a four-day journey.

03:54.343 --> 03:55.945
We gonna have to push.

03:55.977 --> 03:58.915
We told Grant and the other
stations we would lay low.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.159
Well, if there's any trouble to be had,

04:00.183 --> 04:02.185
I'd rather face it on the road.

04:02.218 --> 04:04.786
So we take the Cuyahoga
up and catch the train.

04:05.166 --> 04:06.589
What's the route to the river?

04:06.622 --> 04:08.124
You ain't traveled it.

04:08.157 --> 04:10.360
That stretch of woods is tough.

04:10.392 --> 04:11.888
Only use it when we ain't
got another choice.

04:11.912 --> 04:13.830
- Perhaps we to...
- Excuse me, ma'am.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.132
Is lunch ready?

04:17.165 --> 04:18.535
No, it is not.

04:24.073 --> 04:25.208
Tell us about the furrier.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.708
Met him through a bondsman

04:26.742 --> 04:28.378
who was workin' for him.

04:28.410 --> 04:30.980
Barely makin' ends meet.
Already smugglin'.

04:31.013 --> 04:32.549
Mean he don't care for authority.

04:32.581 --> 04:33.982
It's gonna take all of that.

04:34.829 --> 04:36.198
It's a dry route.

04:36.339 --> 04:38.153
I'll send word to a woman I know

04:38.187 --> 04:40.023
that'll be able to help with...

04:40.055 --> 04:41.156
Harriet?

04:41.189 --> 04:43.259
I got her!

04:45.108 --> 04:46.362
I've heard rumors

04:46.394 --> 04:47.829
about her spells.

04:47.862 --> 04:49.665
I just thought
it was part of her mystique.

04:49.699 --> 04:52.201
I suppose it is, but it ain't rumors.

04:52.235 --> 04:55.237
I heard that's also where
she gets her visions from.

04:55.850 --> 04:57.607
She'll come around soon.

05:00.398 --> 05:02.845
I meant to thank you earlier.

05:03.876 --> 05:04.813
For helpin' with Noah's escape.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.382
Of course.

05:06.415 --> 05:09.085
The sewing circle is always
there for a member in need.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.021
How's Elizabeth doing?

05:13.054 --> 05:14.990
Best she can, considerin'.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.725
And when is the funeral going to be?

05:23.112 --> 05:25.067
I'll send Elizabeth a wire.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.185
I'll let her know that
you got off safely.

05:30.739 --> 05:32.885
Can you tell her I'm sorry?

05:45.712 --> 05:47.962
The plan has changed.

06:21.489 --> 06:23.360
You didn't get your man.

06:25.154 --> 06:27.255
And it got you doubtin' everything.

06:27.663 --> 06:29.806
He was supposed to be here.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.670
John was supposed to be here.

06:33.502 --> 06:35.972
But ain't nothin' the way
it's supposed to be.

06:36.607 --> 06:38.340
And now you is leavin' me, too.

06:39.809 --> 06:42.111
You got time to figure things out.

06:42.143 --> 06:43.413
No, I don't.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.181
Christmas comin' soon.

06:45.213 --> 06:47.916
It's my only shot of stealin'
my mother and brother.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.951
Look at me.

06:49.985 --> 06:51.565
I ain't ready.

06:51.599 --> 06:54.489
You will be. Everything
you learn moving this cargo

06:54.523 --> 06:56.326
gonna help you rescue your kin.

06:56.359 --> 06:58.761
And ain't nothing more
for you to do about Noah.

07:01.984 --> 07:05.802
Focus on what you got to do now.

07:06.352 --> 07:08.004
Tell me the plan.

07:08.037 --> 07:09.806
We go north along the river.

07:09.838 --> 07:11.374
Find the notches in the trees.

07:11.406 --> 07:12.474
Then what?

07:12.507 --> 07:15.110
Then we travel by day,
stickin' to the back roads,

07:15.143 --> 07:16.521
till we make a break for the water.

07:16.545 --> 07:17.980
And if we make it in good time,

07:18.013 --> 07:19.682
it's a straight shot to the river.

07:19.715 --> 07:21.551
And if you come across any danger,

07:21.583 --> 07:24.420
you remember what I told you
about the instinct.

07:28.357 --> 07:31.227
What if I ain't able to do it alone?

07:34.730 --> 07:37.600
You know what I saw when I had my spell?

07:39.887 --> 07:41.470
You.

07:42.571 --> 07:44.302
On the riverbank.

07:45.074 --> 07:47.042
Boat in the distance.

07:47.076 --> 07:49.250
You had this look on your face.

07:49.612 --> 07:51.022
It was one of...

07:52.766 --> 07:54.417
accomplishment.

07:55.386 --> 07:57.670
And you know who ain't there with you?

08:00.756 --> 08:03.593
Now, these turkey feathers will
protect you from the buckshot.

08:03.626 --> 08:08.030
And you trust Him
to protect you from the rest.

08:13.914 --> 08:16.439
Seem to me they keep movin' the line.

08:16.472 --> 08:17.739
First it's the River Jordan.

08:17.773 --> 08:19.374
Now it's Canada.

08:19.408 --> 08:21.576
Who know what it be
once we get up there?

08:21.610 --> 08:25.247
They always say
"the promise of freedom."

08:25.280 --> 08:27.083
Maybe that's all it is,

08:27.115 --> 08:29.618
a promise that ain't
gonna never be kept.

08:29.651 --> 08:31.687
Remember what Moses said
about St. Catherine?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.688
About it being God's country.
You ever been, Ms. Rose?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.626
- Only a few times.
- And?

08:36.659 --> 08:37.874
What it like?

08:38.626 --> 08:40.096
Still work yet to be done,

08:40.128 --> 08:42.431
but seem like a place

08:42.464 --> 08:44.533
you could stop lookin'
over your shoulder.

08:44.844 --> 08:46.636
And families ain't like they are

08:46.669 --> 08:47.946
down in the South.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.012
They seem whole.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.642
And your children,
you raise 'em without having

08:53.675 --> 08:55.711
to worry about ever having to run.

08:57.085 --> 08:58.448
Miss Rose?

08:58.481 --> 08:59.715
Somethin' wrong?

08:59.747 --> 09:01.583
It's Rosalee!

09:02.254 --> 09:03.618
We lost, ain't we?

09:03.651 --> 09:04.989
Nah.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.088
It do seem like we goin' in circles.

09:07.122 --> 09:08.491
We ain't lost!

09:09.041 --> 09:10.626
Then why's you cryin'?

09:16.027 --> 09:19.001
I seen a markin' half a mile down.

09:19.034 --> 09:20.925
She gonna get us caught out here.

09:20.957 --> 09:23.473
- Don't know where she goin'.
- She...

09:23.506 --> 09:25.607
she brought us out here, didn't she?

09:25.641 --> 09:28.243
She ain't done nothin' but listen
to Moses like the rest of us.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.847
We ain't gonna make it out here.
Listen to that cough of yours.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.683
Find the notches on the trees.

09:33.716 --> 09:36.252
We-we here!

09:36.285 --> 09:37.252
We's here.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.285
We here.

09:43.692 --> 09:47.363
We-we rest the night, travel by day.

10:08.993 --> 10:10.985
A friend of a friend sent me.

10:25.870 --> 10:27.737
Reverend Josiah Henson,

10:27.770 --> 10:30.106
Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
and Arthur Tappan.

10:31.574 --> 10:33.543
Moses usually the one that comes.

10:33.575 --> 10:36.077
Plan done changed, but
the cargo still the same.

10:36.111 --> 10:39.749
They need to drink, and you need to eat.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.007
Well's around back.

10:42.751 --> 10:43.911
I'll bring the cargo through.

10:49.791 --> 10:51.727
Listen to your instincts.

10:55.631 --> 10:57.375
Easy, now.

10:57.967 --> 11:01.404
We gonna want her to bring
that cargo back to us.

11:01.436 --> 11:02.938
Something's off.

11:54.093 --> 11:55.551
You should keep that.

11:55.585 --> 11:56.866
John...

11:57.320 --> 11:59.222
would want you to have it.

12:07.897 --> 12:10.734
He needs to take Valentine now.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.932
I keep...

12:33.957 --> 12:36.460
thinking about children.

12:40.112 --> 12:41.572
Come on, now. You-you need your rest.

12:41.596 --> 12:43.132
For so long,

12:43.166 --> 12:45.935
not being able to have any was like...

12:45.968 --> 12:48.171
like an open wound.

12:48.688 --> 12:51.340
A pain in my entire body.

12:51.929 --> 12:55.496
This work we do...
I thought it helped close it.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.414
But now I can't help but think
that if we'd had a child,

12:59.448 --> 13:02.856
I would have something left of him.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.755
It was foolish of me to think

13:05.787 --> 13:08.157
that there's such a thing
as closing wounds.

13:08.190 --> 13:11.127
They bleed and bleed.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.792
And this one...

13:14.119 --> 13:18.033
I mean, my... my dress...
it's so... it's so clean.

13:18.066 --> 13:22.205
I didn't even... I didn't
even touch him after.

13:22.696 --> 13:24.178
And now he...

13:24.806 --> 13:26.248
he's gone.

13:46.429 --> 13:48.398
It lets out at the river's edge,

13:48.431 --> 13:50.333
and you can make
a quick escape to the tunnel

13:50.365 --> 13:52.000
from any floor of the house.

13:52.033 --> 13:53.969
The stairs go to the second and third.

13:54.003 --> 13:55.805
The ladder all the way to the attic.

13:55.838 --> 13:59.008
This station can house
up to eight comfortably,

13:59.041 --> 14:00.843
more if the need arises.

14:00.876 --> 14:03.444
Valentine is the only
occupant at the moment.

14:04.396 --> 14:06.416
The chill down here in the
winter is insufferable,

14:06.449 --> 14:09.017
which is why we thought
it best to use the attic

14:09.051 --> 14:10.753
as the primary hiding spot.

14:11.019 --> 14:13.422
Primary? There's more?

14:13.455 --> 14:15.425
Hiding places,

14:15.458 --> 14:17.260
compartments for guns, as you know,

14:17.292 --> 14:19.328
and a few hidden passageways.

14:19.362 --> 14:22.832
It's an ingenious design
of which I can take no credit.

14:22.864 --> 14:25.788
Carpentry was a hobby
of my late husband's.

14:27.121 --> 14:30.239
If the cargo is staying
for more than a night or two,

14:30.272 --> 14:32.575
I try to familiarize them
with everything

14:32.608 --> 14:34.077
so that they feel comfortable

14:34.109 --> 14:36.378
moving through the common spaces.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.413
After all, they didn't

14:38.446 --> 14:40.249
brave the dangers of the journey north

14:40.282 --> 14:42.195
to be imprisoned in an attic.

14:46.746 --> 14:48.858
You're not worried about
your boarders seeing them

14:48.891 --> 14:51.127
and giving you up to the authorities?

14:51.160 --> 14:53.964
Most are friends of the cause, like you.

14:59.267 --> 15:02.164
I'd like to show you the rest
of the rooms in the house,

15:02.189 --> 15:03.591
but there's no rush.

15:03.638 --> 15:05.840
If you'll be staying for a while?

15:08.176 --> 15:10.613
There's so much to do
for John's funeral,

15:10.646 --> 15:13.450
but I just had to get out of that house.

15:15.484 --> 15:19.656
Richard had been sick for
a long time before he passed.

15:19.689 --> 15:21.324
I thought I was prepared.

15:21.357 --> 15:23.493
I cannot imagine
what you're going through,

15:23.526 --> 15:25.295
having lost John so suddenly.

15:25.696 --> 15:28.728
I don't think it matters... the time.

15:29.896 --> 15:33.435
The quiet after they're gone
is still deafening.

15:35.970 --> 15:39.109
Staying busy and being around
a lot of people helps.

15:41.176 --> 15:43.113
Rosalee left last night.

15:45.480 --> 15:49.085
She was torn about going,
but Harriet needed her.

15:49.118 --> 15:51.032
She said as much in the wire.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.080
She's not going to make the funeral.

15:54.989 --> 15:58.594
She's the only family
that John has left.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.998
I know that she wanted to be there.

16:03.008 --> 16:05.335
I think it was just too much.

16:09.705 --> 16:12.130
Everybody grieves in their own way.

16:45.574 --> 16:50.213
I used to lay awake at night
thinkin' on the number 39.

16:52.882 --> 16:57.152
That was the number of lashes
the overseer was allowed

16:57.185 --> 16:59.189
by Massa Slattery to give us.

17:01.056 --> 17:06.595
Not 40, not... 35, but... 39.

17:06.628 --> 17:09.699
Why 39?

17:13.852 --> 17:17.940
I used to lay awake and thinkin'
on all the sufferin'

17:17.972 --> 17:19.473
massa gave out.

17:21.544 --> 17:24.781
Then I start thinkin'
on all the other plantations,

17:24.814 --> 17:28.750
what they going through,
what they sufferin',

17:28.784 --> 17:30.820
how many lashes they got.

17:33.622 --> 17:35.458
Countless sleepless nights.

17:37.593 --> 17:39.461
Got so bad, I start...

17:39.495 --> 17:41.229
started tradin' anything I could

17:41.263 --> 17:43.526
to get my hands on some laudanum,

17:44.814 --> 17:47.236
just so I could get
a little piece of sleep.

17:51.069 --> 17:52.909
But you know what I realized?

17:56.644 --> 17:58.613
Ain't no sense to this world.

17:59.005 --> 18:01.783
There be the bad, but
there be the good, too.

18:01.816 --> 18:03.452
And look at me.

18:03.947 --> 18:05.797
I'm almost to freedom...

18:07.088 --> 18:08.990
wearin' a good man's suit.

18:09.804 --> 18:11.928
You just got to have a little faith

18:11.960 --> 18:13.997
that things'll be all right.

18:32.614 --> 18:34.033
You get you some sleep.

20:01.804 --> 20:05.107
They were serene, elegant,

20:05.140 --> 20:07.710
and nothing like
my scatterbrained husband.

20:07.742 --> 20:10.779
Gerber daisies... that's what
they should have been.

20:10.813 --> 20:13.648
I put them on his grave
from time to time.

20:15.284 --> 20:17.719
The florist came by looking for you.

20:17.752 --> 20:20.589
Even left a few flowers for you to see.

20:20.849 --> 20:23.793
He'll need a decision on the
arrangements for John's service

20:23.825 --> 20:26.461
by 5:00 if they are
to be ready for tomorrow.

20:26.495 --> 20:28.764
That gives us a little over an hour.

20:28.796 --> 20:30.565
Plenty of time.

20:30.598 --> 20:33.768
And then there is the matter
of choosing the plot

20:33.802 --> 20:35.605
and the Psalm to be read.

20:35.638 --> 20:37.640
And John's suit will need
to be pressed, as well.

20:37.672 --> 20:39.508
I'd be happy to do it.

20:41.477 --> 20:42.969
I know it's a lot.

20:43.778 --> 20:47.049
But I promise
we can conquer it all together.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.286
If we leave now.

21:01.663 --> 21:03.563
I have sat on this bench

21:04.199 --> 21:09.036
waiting for John to get out
of court a thousand times.

21:10.005 --> 21:12.608
When he had a case, he would
throw himself into it

21:12.641 --> 21:15.344
so completely that he
practically lived here.

21:17.446 --> 21:19.092
It's what I loved about him.

21:19.407 --> 21:22.420
He really believed he
could make a difference.

21:23.719 --> 21:25.688
He devoted his life to this place,

21:25.720 --> 21:30.512
and not one... goddamn person

21:30.537 --> 21:34.664
cares about getting
justice for his murder.

21:38.700 --> 21:42.137
A good man, the best man,
was shot in broad daylight,

21:42.171 --> 21:45.582
and everybody's calling
it a senseless act.

21:46.542 --> 21:50.103
That's just... that's just an excuse.

21:51.579 --> 21:53.715
So nobody has to take responsibility

21:53.748 --> 21:58.798
for allowing this world to be senseless.

22:00.488 --> 22:02.054
So what?

22:03.158 --> 22:04.860
You take my gun from your purse

22:04.892 --> 22:07.534
and you make someone
take responsibility?

22:08.730 --> 22:11.078
A judge? A deputy?

22:12.510 --> 22:14.135
You said it.

22:14.902 --> 22:18.190
We have to disrupt
their happy little lives.

22:18.774 --> 22:20.476
That is not what I meant.

22:20.508 --> 22:22.877
This is not justice.

22:22.911 --> 22:24.814
It won't make anything good and fair.

22:24.846 --> 22:26.047
John would have stopped...

22:26.081 --> 22:27.883
You wouldn't be doing it for John,

22:27.915 --> 22:29.785
you'd be doing it for yourself.

22:38.045 --> 22:39.387
Leave me alone.

22:41.823 --> 22:43.108
Please.

22:46.802 --> 22:48.938
I am not going anywhere.

24:17.021 --> 24:18.794
This here sacred tree

24:19.548 --> 24:23.065
been here since before we was
stole from across the sea.

24:23.620 --> 24:26.397
Been here long before
the great house was built.

24:27.268 --> 24:30.171
And gonna be here long
after the field dry up.

24:30.405 --> 24:32.374
And just like this here tree,

24:32.406 --> 24:34.576
nourished by the blood of we ancestors,

24:34.608 --> 24:36.948
we too will thrive.

24:46.793 --> 24:48.257
What that you singin'?

24:52.761 --> 24:54.061
I don't know.

24:57.031 --> 25:00.468
Them spirits got ahold of
that pretty voice of yours?

25:04.305 --> 25:06.942
Let's see.

25:12.213 --> 25:14.133
There's a poison making it way

25:14.167 --> 25:15.417
through we people.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.919
Making we spirit weak.

25:20.351 --> 25:23.759
Some amongst we,
the evil done take over.

25:23.791 --> 25:25.493
Yeah, yeah, Lord.

25:25.527 --> 25:28.321
They done forgot what
we ancestors taught we.

25:29.664 --> 25:33.268
We hang the bottles for trap the
evil spirit that threaten us.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.065
Daughter, please.

25:35.669 --> 25:38.706
To keep we people strong.

25:39.411 --> 25:40.680
This here who we be.

25:46.335 --> 25:47.937
This sacred tree can protect we

25:47.971 --> 25:50.268
if we protect one another.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.475
Yes, sir.

25:51.507 --> 25:54.143
It be the ancestor way,

25:54.177 --> 25:55.812
it be we way,

25:56.393 --> 25:57.928
it gon' be the children way.

26:04.108 --> 26:05.969
I ain't mean to hurt you.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.371
You know that, right?

26:08.405 --> 26:10.074
Them pretty eyes...

26:11.974 --> 26:14.807
that low honey voice.

26:16.187 --> 26:18.916
I would do anything for you.

26:20.283 --> 26:22.915
And I know you feel the same.

26:26.198 --> 26:28.764
There's a girl
that's gonna need your help.

26:30.092 --> 26:32.796
You gonna help her for me?

26:53.833 --> 26:55.585
Storm coming.

26:55.618 --> 26:57.087
About two days out.

26:57.119 --> 26:59.924
I'm gonna walk on over
to the east plantation,

26:59.956 --> 27:01.157
get some trading done

27:01.190 --> 27:03.092
before the flood cut 'em off.

27:45.022 --> 27:47.237
Hicks say you's could help me.

27:53.229 --> 27:55.079
Drink all of it.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.214
It hurt?

27:58.153 --> 28:01.127
You'll have some pain,
pass the baby sometime later.

28:02.519 --> 28:04.495
It's gonna be bloody.

28:06.461 --> 28:08.526
Ain't like I never bled before.

28:13.321 --> 28:15.505
You gonna stand there, you got to work.

28:21.314 --> 28:22.940
You know who the father is?

28:26.503 --> 28:27.704
I only laid

28:27.729 --> 28:29.598
with your man one time.

28:35.985 --> 28:37.754
He don't want it.

28:38.275 --> 28:41.209
And even if he did, he ain't
the fathering type no way.

28:42.626 --> 28:45.095
What everybody gonna say
when they find out?

28:45.621 --> 28:47.335
They gonna shame meself.

28:48.524 --> 28:50.227
Shame me father.

28:50.333 --> 28:53.202
Some of 'em good people,
but some of 'em...

28:53.235 --> 28:55.039
they just, they wait for something

28:55.071 --> 28:57.007
to bring the table-tapper low with.

28:57.787 --> 29:00.311
Everybody gonna help raise him.

29:00.343 --> 29:01.945
That's how they be.

29:02.429 --> 29:04.892
Talk bad about you, then help.

29:05.936 --> 29:08.051
And ain't no man gonna want me.

29:08.084 --> 29:10.320
Not for marry, nohow.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.622
I have this baby,

29:13.029 --> 29:14.992
maybe this baby all me gonna have.

29:19.996 --> 29:22.131
You got chillun?

29:23.060 --> 29:24.670
Yes.

29:25.799 --> 29:26.837
And?

29:29.872 --> 29:32.642
And they were the best thing in my life.

29:57.567 --> 30:00.204
Me can't remember the last time

30:00.236 --> 30:02.171
we big house been open like this yonder.

30:02.205 --> 30:04.017
Mimba say they sending
them girls from the great house

30:04.041 --> 30:05.009
to get 'em ready.

30:05.042 --> 30:06.776
For who? Not Massa Rowe.

30:06.810 --> 30:08.311
- How you know?
- Shh!

30:11.214 --> 30:12.683
How you know ain't massa?

30:12.715 --> 30:15.185
Honey, ever lay a eye
on Massa Rowe round these parts?

30:15.217 --> 30:17.620
Hell, ever lay eyes
on Massa Rowe at all?

30:17.654 --> 30:21.025
Could've been that white man
just passed us now?

30:46.183 --> 30:48.385
I used to love the taste of them berries

30:48.417 --> 30:51.645
on your lips, back when
you was carrying Sam.

30:53.936 --> 30:56.683
Funny how a memory can
take hold of the senses.

30:58.294 --> 31:00.811
The smell, the taste.

31:01.263 --> 31:03.334
Make 'em mean something.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.648
What them berries taste like to you?

31:08.934 --> 31:10.706
Happiness.

31:12.975 --> 31:14.880
We was happy then.

31:16.104 --> 31:18.359
Sam warm in your belly,

31:18.747 --> 31:20.616
life full of possibilities.

31:22.577 --> 31:25.221
Then he was born, and all that changed.

31:25.871 --> 31:28.334
The fear creeped in...

31:28.992 --> 31:30.949
stole everything.

31:32.128 --> 31:33.792
That's not true.

31:35.232 --> 31:37.816
We was happy until...

31:39.401 --> 31:40.983
Until I died.

31:42.570 --> 31:45.110
That was when your eyes
fell on the big house.

31:46.312 --> 31:48.587
Wasn't gonna love no more unless
you got something from it,

31:48.611 --> 31:51.114
other than heartbreak.

31:51.527 --> 31:53.279
That ain't true.

31:55.685 --> 31:59.183
I couldn't let what happened
to you happen to Sam.

32:00.256 --> 32:04.070
You let your heart go cold.

32:04.828 --> 32:06.583
He felt it.

32:07.263 --> 32:08.998
Rosalee, too. That's why she ran.

32:09.032 --> 32:10.375
No.

32:11.641 --> 32:14.303
My chillun knew how much I loved them.

32:15.111 --> 32:16.582
That's right.

32:18.542 --> 32:20.811
You loved them so much

32:21.263 --> 32:23.747
that you opened your legs
whenever the massa called

32:23.781 --> 32:25.116
to protect 'em.

32:26.117 --> 32:27.724
Killed for 'em.

32:29.186 --> 32:32.188
You loved your chillun
so much that, after James,

32:32.637 --> 32:36.541
you made sure that you
couldn't have no more.

32:40.404 --> 32:43.032
Your chillun is the worst thing
that ever happened to you.

32:45.301 --> 32:48.338
And here you are,
picking raspberry leaves

32:48.370 --> 32:50.840
for that... that girl and her baby.

33:01.384 --> 33:02.618
No, no, please.

33:02.651 --> 33:04.520
- Come here!
- Please, please!

33:04.553 --> 33:06.857
- Shut up!
- Please, don't do this! Please, don't do this!

33:06.889 --> 33:09.059
- Shut your goddamn mouth!
- No! No!

33:09.091 --> 33:11.294
I want the baby.

33:11.328 --> 33:13.196
- Please!
- Shh!

33:13.230 --> 33:14.472
I ain't never gonna tell nobody.

33:14.496 --> 33:16.075
Shut your mouth, woman,
'fore somebody hear you!

33:16.099 --> 33:17.167
Shut up!

33:17.199 --> 33:18.199
Where it at?

33:20.704 --> 33:21.906
Where it at?!

33:34.417 --> 33:36.386
Swallow it.

33:36.418 --> 33:38.388
Swallow it. Swallow it!

34:39.964 --> 34:41.418
French?

36:18.778 --> 36:19.981
I can't see.

36:21.849 --> 36:23.041
Piss and shite!

39:27.934 --> 39:31.036
Hey, guys. Sorry, the wagon
was a little cramped,

39:31.061 --> 39:32.864
so I just thought I'd stretch my legs.

39:39.407 --> 39:41.276
Enough.

39:53.999 --> 39:55.468
You're doin' it wrong.

39:57.236 --> 39:59.972
I could've fixed it a couple hours ago.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.776
Been back on the road to
wherever y'all takin' me by now,

40:02.809 --> 40:05.044
but that's all right.

40:05.077 --> 40:07.447
Got myself a nice bit of sleep in.

40:07.481 --> 40:08.481
Just lovely.

40:16.689 --> 40:18.782
You still doin' it wrong.

40:20.026 --> 40:21.762
Y'all think y'all too
good to talk to me?

40:22.928 --> 40:24.438
You ain't.

40:25.332 --> 40:27.667
You out here, handlin' the cattle

40:27.700 --> 40:29.469
with your rundown wagon.

40:29.503 --> 40:31.305
Trudging through the mud and the heat.

40:31.846 --> 40:34.341
Seem to me that make you the slave.

40:35.309 --> 40:36.676
And that man

40:36.709 --> 40:38.678
in the fancy carriage...

40:38.711 --> 40:39.847
he the massa.

40:41.948 --> 40:44.726
So you can speak English.

40:44.980 --> 40:47.687
Clever. You've been watching us.

40:47.720 --> 40:49.356
Enough to know if anyone

40:49.388 --> 40:51.325
was gonna slip up, it'd be this arse.

40:51.358 --> 40:52.859
But you're not the only one

40:52.892 --> 40:54.982
who knows how to read a man.

40:56.261 --> 40:58.030
You're keeping something from us.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.567
At least, you think you are.

41:06.786 --> 41:09.188
What's this?

41:09.260 --> 41:12.297
This means something
to you, doesn't it?

41:12.646 --> 41:14.647
Looks a little wee bit small for you.

41:14.680 --> 41:18.149
But I got a real sweet lass back
in Edinburgh who'll love it.

41:19.586 --> 41:20.954
It's no lass I know

41:21.536 --> 41:22.801
want something that ugly.

41:26.992 --> 41:30.329
Five months you spent in
that jail, making this,

41:30.363 --> 41:33.200
instead of trying to escape.
You know what that tells me?

41:33.899 --> 41:35.503
You're an idiot.

41:38.242 --> 41:41.899
What it should tell you
is that I'm a patient man.

41:42.675 --> 41:44.644
The type that'd spend
three days and three nights

41:44.678 --> 41:47.180
destroying the wagon
you can't seem to fix.

41:47.815 --> 41:49.182
It should tell you

41:49.214 --> 41:50.716
that I care enough about somebody

41:50.749 --> 41:52.191
that I'm gonna get back to 'em.

41:52.216 --> 41:53.544
No matter what.

41:56.354 --> 41:57.856
But you didn't go anywhere.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.303
You're right back here in chains.

42:00.545 --> 42:02.343
I won't always be.

42:03.597 --> 42:04.944
And when I ain't...

42:05.970 --> 42:08.440
first thing I'm-a do
is get that ring.

42:41.635 --> 42:43.803
Everybody back up. Back up.

42:44.910 --> 42:46.262
You.

42:46.302 --> 42:48.608
You remember what I told you?
First thing.

42:49.843 --> 42:51.211
Give him the ring.

42:51.676 --> 42:53.113
Do it.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.026
Anyone moves,

42:56.059 --> 42:59.252
anyone tries to follow me out,
your massa gets it.

43:10.030 --> 43:11.604
Problem is...

43:13.070 --> 43:14.973
he's not the massa.

43:19.705 --> 43:21.441
I am.

43:26.101 --> 43:27.811
Yes! Lift my left
leg. Lift up the left leg.

43:27.835 --> 43:30.460
Yeah, a little higher.

43:30.527 --> 43:31.695
Little higher.

43:31.728 --> 43:33.496
Don't stop! Don't stop!

43:33.529 --> 43:35.865
Yes!!

43:45.622 --> 43:46.622
Get out.

43:47.301 --> 43:48.903
Go.

43:57.691 --> 43:58.901
Mr. Donahue.

43:58.933 --> 44:00.435
Miss Cannon.

44:00.468 --> 44:02.170
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

44:02.203 --> 44:03.705
Call me Elden.

44:03.738 --> 44:04.940
I was just now

44:04.973 --> 44:07.075
reading your latest, The Fuller.

44:07.107 --> 44:08.443
It's good.

44:08.475 --> 44:10.350
Without trying too hard.

44:10.375 --> 44:12.011
I appreciate the compliment.

44:12.036 --> 44:14.140
That's exactly how I want
my legacy to be recorded.

44:15.968 --> 44:16.919
Please.

44:16.952 --> 44:18.283
Thank you.

44:20.336 --> 44:24.292
I have to admit, Miss Cannon,
your story is compelling.

44:24.325 --> 44:26.093
From the start... the daughter

44:26.127 --> 44:28.063
of an English nobleman

44:28.095 --> 44:30.064
and the American whore he laid with.

44:31.966 --> 44:33.968
Love is the great equalizer, isn't it?

44:34.002 --> 44:35.137
And slave catching.

44:35.169 --> 44:36.537
I'm taken in by it.

44:36.571 --> 44:38.140
In a country that celebrates

44:38.173 --> 44:40.776
both its freedom and its commerce,

44:40.808 --> 44:42.944
it's in the context of your occupation

44:42.977 --> 44:44.479
where the two meet to do battle.

44:44.511 --> 44:46.147
I have never thought of it that way.

44:46.180 --> 44:47.327
I've done my research.

44:47.361 --> 44:49.584
And you are one of the most notorious

44:49.616 --> 44:50.727
slave catchers out there.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.487
Well, I am excited for people
to hear my story.

44:53.520 --> 44:54.555
Perhaps.

44:54.589 --> 44:56.224
If I may,

44:56.256 --> 44:58.559
there is one question
I've been dying to ask you.

44:59.761 --> 45:00.963
That's why we're here.

45:01.562 --> 45:03.898
To be the most notorious
slave catcher...

45:04.799 --> 45:06.335
one would think you'd have caught

45:06.368 --> 45:08.103
the most notorious runaway.

45:10.781 --> 45:12.107
Harriet Tubman.

45:12.140 --> 45:13.140
That's right.

45:16.444 --> 45:18.019
That's not a question.

45:19.406 --> 45:21.241
Fair enough.

45:21.549 --> 45:25.153
I suppose my question is...

45:25.185 --> 45:26.531
well...

45:27.354 --> 45:30.024
why shouldn't I be
writing the book about her?

45:38.066 --> 45:41.203
This is how my system works.

45:41.236 --> 45:43.472
My guys come in
and they bring me the money

45:43.504 --> 45:45.339
from the successful capture
of a runaway.

45:45.372 --> 45:47.355
And then I assign them the next one.

45:47.387 --> 45:49.877
In the event that we ever
work together, Miss Cannon,

45:49.910 --> 45:51.455
you don't have to
provide all the details.

45:51.479 --> 45:54.883
I'll simply write down
what I see, as I see it.

46:04.781 --> 46:06.294
You're light again, Jack.

46:06.327 --> 46:08.129
One of 'em slipped away.

46:08.162 --> 46:09.830
Let me guess:

46:09.863 --> 46:13.063
Pete? Five-foot-two, 110 pounds?

46:13.071 --> 46:16.241
I don't appreciate your taking
stabs at my manhood, Patty.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.918
Nigger Pete seems to be
stabbing your manhood

46:17.942 --> 46:19.044
good enough for everyone.

46:19.853 --> 46:21.180
Here's the thing, Jack.

46:21.437 --> 46:22.915
I'm handing you five dollars.

46:23.325 --> 46:25.159
Five dollars, and I certainly
ain't gonna waste

46:25.183 --> 46:26.852
any kind of good lead on you.

46:26.884 --> 46:27.852
Figured as much.

46:27.886 --> 46:29.188
Well, then why show your face,

46:29.221 --> 46:30.723
take this kind of embarrassment?

46:30.756 --> 46:32.857
For five dollars? Is it really worth it?

46:32.890 --> 46:34.358
I showed up because

46:34.392 --> 46:35.936
I got word on where this Harriet Tubman

46:35.960 --> 46:37.596
you've been asking about may be.

46:39.864 --> 46:41.090
I was playing draw

46:41.124 --> 46:42.835
with this fella,

46:42.868 --> 46:45.170
spends nights with a lonely piece.

46:45.203 --> 46:46.988
Up by the Cuyahoga.

46:47.739 --> 46:49.942
Says Tubman pass through.

46:49.975 --> 46:51.610
Pays her for water.

46:53.537 --> 46:54.705
Smoke...

46:58.250 --> 46:59.952
get the horses.

46:59.984 --> 47:02.555
And my long-range. And you know what?

47:03.622 --> 47:05.089
Get Jack a ten-dollar advance

47:05.123 --> 47:06.859
for the trip north he's gonna be

47:06.892 --> 47:08.393
taking with us.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.929
Come on. We're on the hunt, boys!

47:24.867 --> 47:26.770
So who was she?

47:27.978 --> 47:29.793
I'm sure I don't know.

47:34.486 --> 47:35.821
Please.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.955
Look, I did what you asked.

47:37.989 --> 47:39.324
I'd hate

47:39.357 --> 47:41.594
for my lead on Harriet to go dead here.

47:43.094 --> 47:44.897
And that girl seemed to know Harriet.

47:45.209 --> 47:46.998
So I could ask her.

47:49.907 --> 47:52.276
Or I can keep asking you.

47:54.272 --> 47:56.975
All I know is...

47:57.007 --> 48:00.913
they call her the Black Rose.

48:05.455 --> 48:06.651
Shut your mouth!

48:06.685 --> 48:08.195
- You're gonna bring 'em right to us.
- Shh!

48:08.219 --> 48:09.862
You yellin' ain't helpin'.

48:11.857 --> 48:13.192
Chew on this.

48:16.058 --> 48:18.196
You said it was gon' be
a straight shot to the river.

48:18.615 --> 48:19.865
It is.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.041
Then we should've rode hard for it.

48:21.065 --> 48:22.667
No sense in us leaving that wagon.

48:22.701 --> 48:24.303
There be too much mud around.

48:24.335 --> 48:26.616
We leave tracks, they know
we goin' straight for the boat.

48:27.143 --> 48:28.940
Who'd know?

48:28.973 --> 48:30.508
You said you ain't seen nobody.

48:31.082 --> 48:32.643
Somethin' ain't feel right.

48:32.676 --> 48:34.712
They out there, don't know how many.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.180
But we ain't takin' no chances.

48:36.214 --> 48:37.516
What we's gon' do

48:37.549 --> 48:38.851
if we miss that boat?

48:38.884 --> 48:40.385
Ain't no missin' it.

48:40.835 --> 48:42.653
We gonna wait till
it's right on that shore.

48:42.687 --> 48:44.288
And run when the time is right.

48:44.321 --> 48:45.857
And when's that gonna be?

48:55.129 --> 48:56.553
Wait.

48:58.569 --> 48:59.904
What is it?

48:59.937 --> 49:00.905
Shh.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.875
What you hear?

49:05.576 --> 49:07.511
Move! Through them trees!

49:07.544 --> 49:09.080
Go, go, go.

49:09.114 --> 49:10.516
Get on, now.

49:11.283 --> 49:12.859
Come on.

49:12.884 --> 49:14.552
We almost there.

49:14.785 --> 49:17.054
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

49:17.087 --> 49:19.091
Now, listen to me.

49:19.123 --> 49:20.091
You got life,

49:20.125 --> 49:21.125
you got death.

49:21.701 --> 49:23.861
You got to trust
your instincts right now.

49:23.895 --> 49:26.265
That animal, that animal inside of you,

49:26.297 --> 49:28.539
that fear he bring, it be powerful.

49:28.572 --> 49:30.368
It gonna make your eyes blink wider,

49:30.402 --> 49:31.937
make your heart beat faster.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.079
You gots to use it right now.

49:33.103 --> 49:34.339
This is the only thing

49:34.372 --> 49:35.808
that's gonna save your life.

49:38.375 --> 49:40.111
Run!

49:45.336 --> 49:47.936
Know what I saw when I had my spell?

49:47.969 --> 49:51.122
You, on the riverbank,
boat in the distance.

49:51.156 --> 49:53.190
You had this look on your face.

49:53.223 --> 49:56.832
It was one of accomplishment.

50:05.268 --> 50:07.640
Go retrieve my Black Rose.
