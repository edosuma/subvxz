WEBVTT

00:00.669 --> 00:03.723
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Is it about the bees?

00:03.726 --> 00:05.693
Bees?
We're throwing

00:05.695 --> 00:07.373
a housewarming party
in two weeks.

00:07.398 --> 00:08.196
Oh.

00:08.197 --> 00:09.613
It's gonna be friends,
neighbors...

00:09.615 --> 00:11.115
Did he say...
did he say "bees"?

00:11.117 --> 00:14.535
Yeah. Marshall's been working
very long hours lately,

00:14.537 --> 00:17.571
so I have been planning
this whole party by myself,

00:17.573 --> 00:20.424
and everything's in place:
the food, the wine.

00:20.426 --> 00:23.577
I even found a rare
Gouda on the Internet.

00:23.579 --> 00:24.762
Oh.

00:24.764 --> 00:25.963
Getting back
to these bees...

00:25.965 --> 00:28.015
Bottom line: this party
is very important to me,

00:28.017 --> 00:32.519
so I can only assume--
and I say this with love--

00:32.521 --> 00:33.921
you're gonna ruin it.

00:33.923 --> 00:36.840
Lily, I promise I won't ruin
your party.

00:36.842 --> 00:38.592
I'll be charming and convivial.

00:38.594 --> 00:39.944
A regular Burt Reynolds.

00:39.946 --> 00:41.645
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

00:41.647 --> 00:43.747
Tell us about the bees!

00:43.749 --> 00:45.950
Well, all right,
since you asked.

00:45.952 --> 00:47.284
I'm starting up a business

00:47.286 --> 00:49.987
cultivating all-organic,
artisanal honey.

00:49.989 --> 00:52.790
That's right,
I'm a job creator.

00:52.792 --> 00:55.125
Oh.
So this party...

00:55.127 --> 00:56.961
Oh, Lily, wait.
Um, if you don't mind,

00:56.963 --> 00:59.413
I just,
I have one follow-up.

00:59.415 --> 01:02.216
Where are you doing
this exactly?

01:02.218 --> 01:05.135
Downstairs-- there's 10,000 bees
in the basement.

Happy housewarming!

Hey, guys.

01:25.975 --> 01:27.140
Robin here has spent

01:27.142 --> 01:29.243
all day learning
how to make kugel.

01:29.245 --> 01:31.028
Couldn't figure it out--
this is from Zabar's.

01:31.030 --> 01:32.696
Can we heat it up
in your oven?

01:32.698 --> 01:35.366
Faster than heating it up
in the refrigerator.

01:36.485 --> 01:37.501
I've had a few cocktails.

01:37.503 --> 01:39.103
I got it.
Take that.

Oh, no,
that's not what you want.

02:14.490 --> 02:16.657
- What?
- Oh, nothing. So, you think

02:16.659 --> 02:17.825
this is going pretty well?

02:17.827 --> 02:19.126
Baby, are you kidding?

02:19.128 --> 02:21.361
You single-handedly pulled off
the party of the year.

02:21.363 --> 02:24.081
Oh, stop it.
I used both hands.

02:24.083 --> 02:25.532
So, what can I do to help?

02:25.534 --> 02:28.552
Honey, this is your first night
off in however long.

02:28.554 --> 02:31.422
You just relax and keep knocking
back those cocktails.

02:31.424 --> 02:32.923
Mr. Cootes.

02:32.925 --> 02:35.976
Hey, isn't it nice
to finally have a night off?

02:35.978 --> 02:38.095
It is.
But tonight is not <i>that</i> night.

02:38.097 --> 02:40.213
We're going back to the office
in 45 minutes.

02:40.215 --> 02:42.215
But, sir, this is
our housewarming party.

02:42.217 --> 02:44.718
You know,
Mother Earth is also having

02:44.720 --> 02:47.104
a "housewarming" party, too,

02:47.106 --> 02:51.108
only hers ends with humankind
at the bottom of a rising ocean,

02:51.110 --> 02:53.944
passing through the digestive
tract of a stingray.

02:54.829 --> 02:56.580
By the way,
it's a lovely home.

02:56.582 --> 03:00.617
Mr. Cootes,
I know you're a vegan, so I, uh,

03:00.619 --> 03:03.954
I got some vegan spring rolls
for you over there.

03:03.956 --> 03:06.090
Oh, nummies!

03:07.542 --> 03:08.959
You're going
back to work?

03:08.961 --> 03:11.845
Sheez, Marshall,
you are as busy as a...

03:11.847 --> 03:15.432
Oh, gosh,
what are you as busy as?

03:15.434 --> 03:16.633
Please don't talk about
the bees.

03:16.635 --> 03:18.018
I was gonna say Nicolas Cage.

03:18.020 --> 03:20.304
That guy is in everything.

we'll open a couple bottles
of wine...

03:30.766 --> 03:32.232

my beekeeper's suit.

the mice at bay.

Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out. Look alive.

Ooh-ee!

Um, no.

Uh-huh.
And when you were shoveling

04:09.438 --> 04:12.356
the spring rolls down your
gullet, did you happen to notice

04:12.358 --> 04:14.992
a little sign next
to the plate marked "Vegan"?

04:14.994 --> 04:16.642
I think there's
been some mistake.

04:16.644 --> 04:19.813
You could have had anything
on that table!

04:19.815 --> 04:21.531
Anything at all!

04:22.283 --> 04:25.085
Mini pizzas,
bacon-wrapped figs,

04:25.087 --> 04:26.453
pigs in blankets.

04:26.455 --> 04:28.338
There was even talk
of an inbound Gouda!

the one thing

that someone with my dietary
preferences can eat.

04:33.629 --> 04:35.629
Look, I didn't eat
the spring rolls.

04:35.631 --> 04:37.464
Liar!

04:37.466 --> 04:40.484
Your breath reeks of shredded
carrots and deceit!

04:42.220 --> 04:47.174
Okay, okay, maybe I did eat
your precious spring rolls.

04:47.176 --> 04:48.275
Oh...

04:48.277 --> 04:50.844
What are you gonna do
about it, <i>hippie?</i>

fisticuffs...

05:03.358 --> 05:06.043
And feet--
I'm a kicker.

05:06.045 --> 05:09.296
Well, well, looks like
I just started eating

05:09.298 --> 05:11.165
white meat again.

05:11.167 --> 05:15.669
I will bite and scratch
you like a wolverine.

05:15.671 --> 05:17.704
May I warn you,

05:17.706 --> 05:20.974
I have been in
a fight before.

05:20.976 --> 05:23.227
So have I... sort of.

05:23.229 --> 05:25.395
Oh, God.

05:26.481 --> 05:28.515
Mr. Cootes. Hi.

05:28.517 --> 05:31.218
Did you see that we had
hummus and veggies?

05:31.220 --> 05:33.320
There's hummus and veggies?

05:33.322 --> 05:34.554
Over there.

Hey, I'm not gonna let that guy
push me around.

Never surrender."

Shut up, Ted.
Okay.

05:42.948 --> 05:47.918
For God's sake, Lily,
you're pregnant.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.922
For God's sake, Te
Lily's pregnant.

05:54.793 --> 05:56.193
Oh, man.

05:56.195 --> 05:57.911
Sorry about that.

05:57.913 --> 05:59.763
I don't need
this right now, Ted.

05:59.765 --> 06:01.682
I shouldn't do this.

06:01.684 --> 06:02.916
- I shouldn't do this.
- What?

06:02.918 --> 06:06.103
This is a bad idea.
This is a bad idea!

06:06.105 --> 06:08.939
- What is?
- I should just go. I should just go!

06:08.941 --> 06:11.642
Okay, okay, just tell me
what is going on.

06:11.644 --> 06:14.228
I love my penis, Robin.

06:14.230 --> 06:16.530
Oh, Barney, you promised.

06:16.532 --> 06:19.032
I do! I love it!

06:19.034 --> 06:21.235
If I could kiss it, I would.

06:21.237 --> 06:23.954
I'd be lying if I told you
I hadn't tried.

06:23.956 --> 06:26.123
I'm not comfortable
with this conversation.

06:26.125 --> 06:29.943
Oh, come on, Robin, it's my
penis we're talking about.

06:29.945 --> 06:32.162
- You've seen her-- she's magnificent.
- She?

06:32.164 --> 06:35.132
Every penis is a girl, Robin.
Everyone knows that.

06:35.134 --> 06:40.220
Like... ships and lake monsters.

06:40.222 --> 06:42.289
And Gouda!

06:42.291 --> 06:43.974
She's a beauta.

06:43.976 --> 06:45.225
Oh, Gouda.

06:45.227 --> 06:47.460
Well, I'll be back.

06:47.462 --> 06:49.462
Most of me, anyway.

06:50.315 --> 06:51.932
- Don't eat that.
- What?

06:51.934 --> 06:53.934
Whoops! Oh, it's ruined.

06:53.936 --> 06:56.353
It's not ruined.
Ten second rule.

06:56.355 --> 06:59.239
Eight, nine, ten,
and it's ruined.

06:59.241 --> 07:01.158
This whole party's
ruined.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.144
I got a basement
full of bees,

07:04.146 --> 07:06.496
and Ted almost got into a fight
with Mr. Cootes.

07:06.498 --> 07:08.165
Lily, look around.

07:08.167 --> 07:09.816
Everyone's having
an amazing time.

07:09.818 --> 07:11.018
It's a great party.

07:11.020 --> 07:14.838
Okay, maybe it's not
a total disaster.

07:19.661 --> 07:21.528
What the hell was that?!

07:28.597 --> 07:30.730
<i>So that's what happened</i>

these are vegan.

of this caterer.

It's my kitten's
Bat Mitzvah next week.

07:48.387 --> 07:50.837
She's finally
becoming a cat.

07:50.839 --> 07:52.872
Oh, God, you are crazy.

07:52.874 --> 07:54.974
About cats.

07:54.976 --> 07:58.544
Cats are so honest and real
with their affections.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.763
Ever since my divorce,

07:59.765 --> 08:01.564
it's just been one liar
after another.

That's why it's so refreshing
to meet someone honest like you,

Special Agent Gary Powers.

08:07.722 --> 08:09.105
Listen...

08:09.107 --> 08:12.776
I think we can agree
there's something here.

08:12.778 --> 08:14.861
Something big...

08:14.863 --> 08:18.865
that looks
and probably feels real.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.251
Maybe...

08:21.253 --> 08:22.952
we can go back
to your place.

08:22.954 --> 08:25.905
I can't ask you to delay
intercepting those asteroids.

08:25.907 --> 08:28.258
I do need to intercept
those asteroids.

to have sex right now.

I mean, I think it's time
that somebody took him aside

09:22.597 --> 09:24.764
and told him this is not
how you treat your staff.

09:24.766 --> 09:28.017
Well, I'm sort of busy
with the party right now.

09:28.019 --> 09:30.136
Fine. I'll do it myself.
But he's gonna scream at me,

stand up to screaming.

Barney...
Ah, Lily,

09:38.163 --> 09:40.363
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

bacon-wrapped figs,

09:46.087 --> 09:47.120
pigs in blankets.

09:47.122 --> 09:50.156
There was even talk
of an inbound Gouda!

09:50.158 --> 09:52.158
Robin. Okay, listen,
I need your help.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.294
I'm about to get in
a screaming match with my boss,

09:54.296 --> 09:55.828
and I'm not good at getting
screamed at,

09:55.830 --> 09:57.347
so I need you to warm me up.

09:57.349 --> 09:59.132
How?
I want you to scream at me.

09:59.134 --> 10:01.351
You know, like you do
to strangers on the street

10:01.353 --> 10:02.769
at the slightest provocation.

10:02.771 --> 10:04.137
I don't do that.

10:04.139 --> 10:05.772
Come on, lay some of that
classic Scherbatsky

10:05.774 --> 10:07.273
mean son of a bitch on me.

10:07.275 --> 10:09.809
Treat me like I'm a Girl Scout
trying to sell you cookies.

10:09.811 --> 10:11.895
Four dollars a box
and you're out of Thin Mints?!

10:11.897 --> 10:15.315
You green little...!
I don't do that!

10:15.317 --> 10:16.816
Come on, scream at me.

10:16.818 --> 10:19.068
Like that.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.286
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

10:20.288 --> 10:22.622
Marshall, there is plenty
of stuff

10:22.624 --> 10:24.574
that I don't get mad about,

10:24.576 --> 10:26.859
like the fact that you're
serving pigs in blankets

10:26.861 --> 10:28.694
without hot mustard.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.664
I'm not the type of person
to be driven crazy by a host

10:31.666 --> 10:34.050
who refuses to provide
delicious hot mustard

10:34.052 --> 10:35.969
in which to dip
my pigs in blankets!

10:35.971 --> 10:38.037
I'm the type of girl who...
keeps her cool.

10:38.039 --> 10:40.006
Who keeps her cool.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.043
Wait. Whoa, baby,
are you okay?

10:44.045 --> 10:46.212
Of course.
This party is great.

10:46.214 --> 10:49.699
I am handling this.
Oh, God.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.103
No...

10:54.105 --> 10:55.355
Hummus and veggies?

10:55.357 --> 10:58.074
I'm looking for
hummus and veggies.

10:58.076 --> 11:00.743
Robin, can I talk to you about
something very dear to me?

11:00.745 --> 11:02.612
Promise me this isn't
about your penis.

11:02.614 --> 11:05.014
I promise it isn't
about my penis.

11:05.016 --> 11:06.499
I'm sorry.

11:08.953 --> 11:11.688
Excuse me, sir, could I talk
to you in the kitchen?

11:17.795 --> 11:19.178
Sorry about that.

11:19.180 --> 11:20.797
I don't need this
right now, Ted.

11:20.799 --> 11:23.216
I swear, if there's
one more crisis...

11:23.218 --> 11:25.101
Well, the bees
escaped their enclosure,

11:25.103 --> 11:27.804
but no reason
to "bee" concerned.

11:29.858 --> 11:31.691
No, there is,
we're in big trouble.

11:31.693 --> 11:33.309
What is that smell?

11:33.311 --> 11:35.594
Oh, I doused my suit
with kerosene.

11:35.596 --> 11:37.263
All beekeepers do this.

11:37.265 --> 11:39.482
Dad, just take off
the suit right now.

11:39.484 --> 11:40.283
All right, fine.

11:40.285 --> 11:42.101
Every 30 seconds,

11:42.103 --> 11:44.287
there's another crisis
that needs to be dealt with

11:44.289 --> 11:45.955
and I have
to deal with it.

11:45.957 --> 11:48.708
This is... Oh, God.

11:48.710 --> 11:50.326
This is parenthood, isn't it?

11:50.328 --> 11:51.577
So they say.

11:51.579 --> 11:53.162
Okay, it's official.

11:53.164 --> 11:55.548
I thought I could do it,
but I can't.

11:55.550 --> 11:57.083
No, Marshall's always at work.

11:57.085 --> 11:58.551
He's got to go back tonight.

11:58.553 --> 12:00.503
And I don't know
if I can handle a life

12:00.505 --> 12:02.805
that's just one crisis
after another.

12:02.807 --> 12:05.124
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna
give you a little piece of...

12:05.126 --> 12:06.476
Gouda!

12:06.478 --> 12:07.460
God.

12:07.462 --> 12:09.312
Crisis?
Crisis.

12:10.648 --> 12:12.815
- Don't eat that. Whoops!
- What?

12:12.817 --> 12:14.150
Gouda's out, Ted.
Don't sleep on the Gouda.

12:14.152 --> 12:15.351
Wouldn't dream of it.

12:15.353 --> 12:17.136
So Lily told me you have to go
back to work tonight?

12:17.138 --> 12:18.855
No, I don't have to go
back to work tonight.

12:18.857 --> 12:20.273
Mr. Cootes and I
came to an understanding.

12:20.275 --> 12:21.658
But, hey, what's going on
with Robin?

12:21.660 --> 12:23.609
I called her
a mean son of a bitch

12:23.611 --> 12:24.810
and she took it all weird.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.446
- She did?
- Yeah.

12:26.448 --> 12:27.630
Crazy, right?

12:28.165 --> 12:29.365
Hey, buddy.

12:29.367 --> 12:31.034
Best housewarming
party ever.

12:31.036 --> 12:33.486
Everybody's abuzz.

12:33.488 --> 12:34.987
Abuzz.

12:34.989 --> 12:36.539
Oh, good one, Mickey.

12:36.541 --> 12:37.840
But, hey, you're right.

12:37.842 --> 12:39.826
Great party.

12:46.684 --> 12:49.886
What the hell
was that?!

12:53.666 --> 12:55.749
<i>And that's what happened</i>
<i>in the dining room.</i>

12:57.326 --> 13:00.494
<i>Now I'm gonna tell you</i>
<i>what happened in the kitchen.</i>

13:01.474 --> 13:04.493
Oh, no, that's not
what you want.

13:04.495 --> 13:06.929
Man, I can't believe
these are vegan.

13:06.931 --> 13:08.130
Back to our fight?

13:08.132 --> 13:09.581
Back to our fight.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.900
I cannot believe you screamed
at that woman at Zabar's.

13:11.902 --> 13:13.268
She was trying to cut in line.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.753
She was gonna get
the last kugel.

13:14.755 --> 13:15.971
She was 90 years old.

13:15.973 --> 13:18.107
It was probably gonna be
her last kugel.

13:18.109 --> 13:19.942
Sometimes in life,
you have to be assertive

13:19.944 --> 13:21.259
and stand up for yourself.

13:21.261 --> 13:22.594
You called her a whore.

13:22.596 --> 13:24.062
Who wears that much makeup?!

13:24.064 --> 13:25.030
Old ladies!

13:25.032 --> 13:27.149
Who take money for sex. Exactly.

13:28.201 --> 13:29.535
Look, I'm sorry.

13:29.537 --> 13:32.270
If I would've left things
in your dainty, lily-white,

13:32.272 --> 13:34.156
never-ripped-
an-old-lady's-wig-off hands,

13:34.158 --> 13:36.208
we would be kugel-free
right now.

13:36.210 --> 13:37.876
Oh, so, what, I'm too nice?

13:37.878 --> 13:39.461
You never stand up for yourself.

13:39.463 --> 13:41.914
Remember that sixth grader
who kept stealing your lunch?

13:41.916 --> 13:44.750
High school was
a tough time for me, okay?

13:44.752 --> 13:46.335
And that girl was muscular.

13:46.337 --> 13:48.003
Forearms like Popeye.

13:48.005 --> 13:49.638
How do you even know about that?

13:49.640 --> 13:51.924
Marshall told me.
He also said that

13:51.926 --> 13:53.342
you had your mom stop making

13:53.344 --> 13:54.893
peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

13:54.895 --> 13:56.628
because of that girl's
nut allergy.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.347
I didn't want to add
to her health problems.

13:58.349 --> 13:59.648
She was already in a wheelchair.

13:59.650 --> 14:01.299
Okay, so what?

14:01.301 --> 14:04.135
I would rather be nice
than be like you,

14:04.137 --> 14:05.821
always getting in fights
about stuff

14:05.823 --> 14:07.272
that's not even worth
fighting about.

14:07.274 --> 14:08.473
Disagree.

14:08.475 --> 14:10.993
It's like Sun Tzu wrote
in <i>The Art of War,</i>

14:10.995 --> 14:13.028
"Never give up.
Never surrender."

14:13.030 --> 14:14.830
That was Tim Allen
in <i>Galaxy Quest.</i>

14:14.832 --> 14:15.981
Whatever, dude.

14:15.983 --> 14:18.000
Your problem is any time
you're faced with

14:18.002 --> 14:20.035
the least bit of confrontation,
you run away.

14:20.037 --> 14:22.604
Oh, I run away
from confrontation?

14:26.459 --> 14:28.794
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out.

14:28.796 --> 14:30.145
Look alive.

14:31.614 --> 14:33.182
Whoops.
Son of a...!

14:33.184 --> 14:34.833
I'm sorry.

14:34.835 --> 14:36.552
Maybe that was my fault.

14:36.554 --> 14:37.719
You think?

14:37.721 --> 14:39.104
You're right in my snack track.

14:39.106 --> 14:41.557
Hey, nice
beekeeper suit.

14:41.559 --> 14:44.676
Do you know that, uh,
most bees are left-handed?

14:44.678 --> 14:47.145
Did you know bees hate
the smell of kerosene?

14:47.147 --> 14:48.814
I knew that.
Geez, what do you think,

14:48.816 --> 14:50.732
this is my first day
as a beekeeper?

14:51.651 --> 14:53.402
Nice. Oh.

14:53.404 --> 14:56.071
Is that true about
bees and kerosene?

14:56.073 --> 14:57.689
I don't know.

14:57.691 --> 14:59.074
Barney...

14:59.076 --> 15:00.075
Ah, Lily,

15:00.077 --> 15:02.244
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

15:02.246 --> 15:04.079
Barney, that woman
you were talking to,

15:04.081 --> 15:05.047
our neighbor Geraldine,

15:05.049 --> 15:06.648
some guy
slept with her

15:06.650 --> 15:09.751
and didn't call her,
so she hunted him down

15:09.753 --> 15:14.556
and cut off a certain part of
his anatomy with a cheese knife.

15:15.342 --> 15:17.009
So, whatever you do,

15:17.011 --> 15:18.510
don't sleep with her.

15:18.512 --> 15:22.347
It's funny, she is,
um, waiting for me

15:22.349 --> 15:24.149
in the guest bedroom right now.

15:24.151 --> 15:26.051
Oh, God! Oh, God!

15:26.053 --> 15:28.570
That was the idea,
but now forget it!

15:28.572 --> 15:29.855
Barney, this is a disaster.

15:29.857 --> 15:32.241
I swear, if there
is one...

15:33.109 --> 15:34.392
It's fine. Everything's fine.

15:34.394 --> 15:35.911
Hey, ten second
rule, right?

15:37.948 --> 15:40.365
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

15:40.367 --> 15:42.868
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

15:42.870 --> 15:45.420
I know you're pregnant, but
you need a glass of wine.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.238
I got that cheese off
the Internet.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.674
I know you got it
off the Internet.

15:48.676 --> 15:50.008
Why does that
make it impressive?

15:50.010 --> 15:52.094
You know what else you can find
on the Internet?

15:52.096 --> 15:53.795
Zoo animals masturbating.

15:54.547 --> 15:55.597
There's one of a walrus.

15:55.599 --> 15:56.748
He's...

15:56.750 --> 15:58.934
Oh.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:11.030 --> 16:12.981
No...

16:16.070 --> 16:18.203
Excuse me, sir, could I talk
to you in the kitchen?

16:26.380 --> 16:30.782
Mr. Cootes, I am not
going back to work tonight.

16:30.784 --> 16:32.668
Oh, no, she didn't
just say that.

16:33.637 --> 16:35.253
Mickey, could we just
have a minute?

16:35.255 --> 16:37.673
Oh, yeah. Sure.

16:39.142 --> 16:42.894
Marshall, look, I know
when you started with this firm,

16:42.896 --> 16:44.596
it was all fun and games.

16:44.598 --> 16:48.400
The office chair races
were particularly spirited.

16:48.402 --> 16:51.737
Until, of course,
Gail went down the stairs.

16:51.739 --> 16:53.405
But for one brief moment,

16:53.407 --> 16:55.941
boy, did she fly.

16:57.778 --> 17:00.028
I'm not here, I'm not here.

17:00.030 --> 17:02.364
Mr. Cootes, you're working
yourself to death.

17:02.366 --> 17:04.816
Just cut loose a little.

17:04.818 --> 17:07.285
Have a beer, find a hobby.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.171
Look, son, it's very simple.

17:09.173 --> 17:11.990
Um, Mother Earth
doesn't get a night off.

17:11.992 --> 17:13.208
Neither do you.

17:13.210 --> 17:14.593
Well, then I quit.

17:18.146 --> 17:20.932
And I don't know
if I can handle a life

17:20.934 --> 17:22.851
that's just one crisis
after another.

17:22.853 --> 17:25.137
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna
give you a little piece of...

17:25.138 --> 17:26.471
Gouda!

17:26.473 --> 17:27.439
Maybe he's right.

17:27.441 --> 17:29.725
Maybe I do
need a hobby.

17:29.727 --> 17:31.360
Well, hey,
how about beekeeping?

17:31.362 --> 17:34.446
Me? No. I-I don't know the
first thing about bees.

17:34.448 --> 17:36.732
You want to know a secret?

17:36.734 --> 17:38.100
Neither do I.

17:38.102 --> 17:40.452
It's not a secret.

17:41.371 --> 17:42.487
Let me try this thing on.

17:42.489 --> 17:43.872
I'm gonna give you
some privacy.

17:43.874 --> 17:45.707
All right, thank you.

17:45.709 --> 17:46.958
Okay.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.410
Hey, buddy.

17:48.412 --> 17:50.245
Best housewarming
party ever.

17:50.247 --> 17:51.963
Everybody's abuzz.

17:54.451 --> 17:57.052
Okay, maybe it's not
a total disaster.

17:57.054 --> 17:58.220
Great party.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.484
Oh, my God. Oh!

18:12.486 --> 18:13.735
Oh, Mr. Cootes!

18:13.737 --> 18:15.103
Mr. Cootes, are you okay?!

18:15.105 --> 18:18.490
That was amazing!

18:18.492 --> 18:19.691
Did you see me?!

18:19.693 --> 18:22.077
I flew through the air
like a human fireball

18:22.079 --> 18:23.361
and didn't get a scratch.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.913
Eat your heart out, Gail!

18:25.899 --> 18:28.399
God, I feel so alive!

18:28.401 --> 18:30.001
I want to drink a beer.

18:30.003 --> 18:31.119
Oh, yeah.

18:31.121 --> 18:32.671
Okay, one beer, coming right up.

18:32.673 --> 18:35.424
Oh, and, uh, Marshall,

18:35.426 --> 18:39.077
I think we'll take
the night off tonight, okay?

18:39.079 --> 18:40.846
Sounds good, yeah.

18:40.848 --> 18:42.964
But I'll see you Monday?

18:42.966 --> 18:45.217
Of course.

18:45.219 --> 18:46.218
Yeah.

18:47.888 --> 18:51.556
You know, Robin, I've
been thinking about it.

18:51.558 --> 18:54.192
Guess it's kind of nice
you're such a badass.

18:54.194 --> 18:57.863
It's pretty badass
you're so nice, Ted.

18:59.765 --> 19:04.319
Was I supposed to close
the basement door?

19:15.373 --> 19:17.373
God, this feels
so right!

19:17.375 --> 19:18.791
We're so great together.

19:18.793 --> 19:21.260
I want to spend every minute
of every day with you.

19:21.262 --> 19:23.129
I never let you out of
my sight for one second.

19:23.131 --> 19:24.797
Not one second, not
one second. I don't!

19:24.799 --> 19:27.099
Oh, God!

19:27.101 --> 19:28.300
My last lover was not like this.

19:28.302 --> 19:29.802
He was the worst!

19:29.804 --> 19:32.938
Do you know, he didn't even
come to my cat's bris.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.557
I mean, what?

19:34.559 --> 19:35.925
Well, we showed him.

19:35.927 --> 19:37.143
Yes, we did.

19:37.145 --> 19:40.262
Let's just say, the
punishment fit the crime.

19:40.264 --> 19:41.730
I can't wait to
tell everybody

19:41.732 --> 19:43.282
that we're boyfriend and girlfriend!

19:43.284 --> 19:44.433
Let's do it tonight.

19:44.435 --> 19:45.785
No, it's Lily and
Marshall's party.

19:45.787 --> 19:47.102
We'll wait.

19:47.104 --> 19:50.239
We can do it at Mittens
and Mr. Pepper's wedding.

19:50.241 --> 19:51.773
Or maybe something...

19:52.305 --> 19:58.681
