WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.829
<i>Previously on</i> S.W.A.T....That's a key to this house.

00:03.873 --> 00:05.135
I want us to live together.

00:05.179 --> 00:06.745
What do you say?

00:06.789 --> 00:09.531
You just came around to the idea
of being a father.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.185
I don't want you to stick around
with someone

00:11.228 --> 00:12.882
who can't make that happen.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.579
Okay, stop it. The only reason
I thought being a father

00:14.623 --> 00:16.277
and having kids
made any kind of sense to me

00:16.320 --> 00:17.843
is 'cause I get to do it
with you.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.063
<i>There is no family</i> <i>
without you first.</i>

00:20.107 --> 00:22.196
Mama Pina provides
more than shelter.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.154
She provides these women
with hope.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.547
You trying to tell me something?

00:25.590 --> 00:26.896
Taking over the safe house
feels like

00:26.939 --> 00:28.854
maybe the change
I've been looking for.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.726
I've been terrified
of losing myself

00:30.769 --> 00:34.773
to the person
I'm terrified of losing.

00:34.817 --> 00:37.298
<i>But if we can please</i> <i>
try this again,</i>

00:37.341 --> 00:39.474
<i>I'd really like that,</i> <i>
because I love you.</i>

00:39.517 --> 00:41.606
<i>I love you.</i>

00:48.831 --> 00:50.093
You don't stop, do you?

00:50.137 --> 00:51.573
What?

00:51.616 --> 00:54.402
I just woke up
next to my dream girl.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.708
What more could anyone want?

00:56.752 --> 00:58.797
Mm, clothes.

01:01.539 --> 01:02.801
Clearly optional.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.373
I have to go home and change.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.812
I'm not doing the
walk of shame into HQ.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.039
I hope it's okay
if we can just...

01:24.997 --> 01:26.651
...keep this between us for now.

01:28.740 --> 01:31.134
Man, I hope that's not
the sound of regret already.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.962
No. Not at all.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.138
It's just...

01:35.182 --> 01:38.663
it's my last day on SWAT, and...

01:38.707 --> 01:41.449
I just don't want it to be
all about this, you know?

01:41.492 --> 01:44.756
Yeah. Of course.

01:47.019 --> 01:49.587
Okay, I have to go
before Luca sees me.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.678
You know, I think
you should be good.

01:53.722 --> 01:56.507
He and Tan were gonna
surf Zuma this morning.

01:56.551 --> 01:59.031
Heard him leave
before the sun came up.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.123
Hey.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.038
Can't believe
it's your last day.

02:06.082 --> 02:08.302
I know.
I mean,
I'm not complaining,

02:08.345 --> 02:10.434
since it means
we get to be together,

02:10.478 --> 02:12.175
but...

02:12.219 --> 02:15.222
20-Squad is gonna
be weird without you.

02:27.843 --> 02:31.020
Oh, yes!

02:31.063 --> 02:32.239
It finally happened?

02:32.282 --> 02:33.457
Dude, what are you doing
home already?

02:33.501 --> 02:34.589
Waves were blown
out, it sucked,

02:34.632 --> 02:35.894
which is totally awesome,

02:35.938 --> 02:37.331
'cause now I am here
to witness this.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.680
You got to rein it in, Luca.

02:38.723 --> 02:41.422
I-- Don't even think
about any high fives.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.337
Okay, I can still be happy
for you both, though, right?

02:43.380 --> 02:44.729
Yes, you can be happy for us,

02:44.773 --> 02:46.209
but you got to keep
your mouth shut.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.515
At least for today.

02:47.558 --> 02:50.170
Once I'm gone from SWAT,
you can go nuts.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.265
Bye.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.092
This is really happening.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.366
Hey, isn't there some kind rule
that says if your proctor

03:12.409 --> 03:15.456
is more than 15 minutes late,
you don't have to take the test?

03:15.499 --> 03:17.109
If you didn't study,
just say so.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.417
My apologies. I know
you're stressed enough

03:20.461 --> 03:21.723
with finals, you don't need

03:21.766 --> 03:22.985
any added drama.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.334
Obviously, I'll
add more time

03:24.378 --> 03:25.422
at the end of the test
to compensate.

03:25.466 --> 03:27.163
Uh, Dr. Winter,

03:27.207 --> 03:29.774
I thought Joseph was supposed
to proctor the final.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.602
I'm not at liberty
to discuss the details,

03:31.646 --> 03:32.908
but I'm afraid
Joseph's been dropped

03:32.951 --> 03:35.127
from the university's
doctoral program.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.738
Wait, why?

03:36.781 --> 03:38.261
I can't disclose that.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.741
There was a disciplinary hearing
this week,

03:39.784 --> 03:41.351
and a decision was made.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.832
We really should get started.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.094
Put your phones away, please.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.753
Joseph, you can't be here.

03:51.796 --> 03:52.928
How about now?

03:54.930 --> 03:57.019
Change in plans
for the final, everybody.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.413
We're going to do something
a little more hands-on.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.980
After all,
it's a chemistry test.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.547
Let's do some chemistry.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.208
No, Joseph. Do you know
how dangerous that is?

04:14.950 --> 04:17.779
What are you waiting for?
This is your final.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.259
Get to work.

04:25.395 --> 04:28.616
Hey, Nichelle,
I got most of my boxes packed,

04:28.659 --> 04:30.922
but I could use a hand
carrying them out.

04:30.966 --> 04:34.143
All right,
I'll just need a minute.

04:34.186 --> 04:36.058
You know,
I'm starting to think

04:36.101 --> 04:37.842
this place is never
gonna look the same.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.671
Your father is moving out,
your girlfriend is moving in.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.760
Did you really expect it
to be the same?

04:42.804 --> 04:45.285
No, baby. I'm all
about the change.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.461
What you looking for?

04:47.504 --> 04:48.853
Oh, I'm taking
some of the high schoolers

04:48.897 --> 04:50.420
to the <i>Queen Mary</i> today.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.204
They have an exhibit
on immigration.

04:52.248 --> 04:55.251
Somewhere around here
I have these little bracelets.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.907
They put pressure on your wrist,
supposed to prevent seasickness.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.691
Nichelle, you ain't
going out to sea.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.911
That boat is permanently
docked. You won't need them.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.261
Just want to be safe.
Chaperoning these kids

05:05.305 --> 05:06.915
is hard enough
when I'm at my best.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.091
Don't want to imagine
if I'm feeling queasy.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.789
Well, I got some Dramamine
from that cruise

05:11.833 --> 05:13.008
that Charice and I took.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.401
Got to be around here someplace.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.794
Uh, no. That's all right.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.101
Baby, I got to go. Oh.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.972
Hey.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.714
Keep this weekend free.
I made some plans.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.716
Oh, yeah?
What's the occasion?

05:25.760 --> 05:28.806
It's a secret. Keep the weekend
free and maybe you'll find out.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.939
Ooh. Well, then, I better
get my butt to work

05:30.982 --> 05:32.897
and earn myself some time off.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.510
Later, Pop.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.163
All right, son.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.904
Don't work too hard,
'cause I'm-a need you

05:39.948 --> 05:42.733
to help me with these boxes
when you get back.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.129
Oh.

05:49.087 --> 05:52.439
I-I'm sorry, I thought
this was one of my boxes.

05:52.482 --> 05:55.180
You can't tell Hondo. Promise?

06:04.146 --> 06:05.495
I'm not gonna lie,

06:05.539 --> 06:06.757
the thought of
doing this job

06:06.801 --> 06:08.106
without you from now on...

06:10.065 --> 06:12.589
...makes me a little upset.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.112
Gonna miss you.

06:15.505 --> 06:19.117
I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye,

06:19.161 --> 06:21.163
but, man, I respect
your passion,

06:21.206 --> 06:22.512
and your commitment.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.343
The women at that safe house,
they're lucky to get you.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.259
I just hope I can
deliver for them.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.869
You will.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.871
And, hey, if you're ever looking
for some extra cash

06:33.915 --> 06:36.831
or miss the action,

06:36.874 --> 06:40.269
I'll always have a gig for you
at my security company.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.448
Actually, Deac, uh, hold up.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.712
I want to give you something.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.585
I been carrying it
for a while.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.111
Saint Jude Thaddeus.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.983
Patron saint of hopeless causes.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.030
Since when did you
become religious?

07:02.073 --> 07:05.381
I'm not, but, uh,
seeing your faith,

07:05.425 --> 07:08.863
and what it means to you,
I don't know, it's, uh...

07:08.906 --> 07:10.473
it's been an inspiration.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.606
Guess I've been carrying it
as a kind of, uh,

07:12.649 --> 07:14.912
"What Would Deacon Do?" token.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.262
You've always
been there for me,

07:17.306 --> 07:19.047
you never gave up on me.

07:19.090 --> 07:22.485
And, uh, I just want you to know
how grateful I am for that.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.923
Thank you.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.237
Let's go.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.023
Here's all we got.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.199
Someone called 911
from one of the labs.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.940
They didn't speak,
but they left the line open.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.333
911 operator
heard yelling

07:44.376 --> 07:45.508
and the mention of a gun.

07:45.552 --> 07:46.727
Barricaded suspect, maybe?

07:46.770 --> 07:47.771
College campus,

07:47.815 --> 07:48.946
finals week, people snap.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.513
Could be anything. Yeah.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.906
Campus cops already cleared
the rest of the building.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.429
They couldn't see
inside the labs.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.605
Doors are locked,
the windows are papered over.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.346
So pretty much,
we're going in blind.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.174
Nothing new about that.
I got the IR ready.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.263
All right. Let's move.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.100
Tan.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.671
What are we looking at?

08:17.714 --> 08:19.237
Picking up eight forms.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.456
Temperature range
says they're all alive,

08:20.500 --> 08:21.849
but there's no movement.

08:21.892 --> 08:22.850
Looks like they're all
prone on the ground.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.547
I smell gas.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.028
Yeah, it's strong.
Coming from inside.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.638
Okay, they're not moving
'cause they're unconscious.

08:28.682 --> 08:29.770
We got to get them out of there.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.380
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hold on.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.425
It's an electronic lock.
If you pop that open,

08:33.469 --> 08:34.557
we'll risk a spark.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.906
Whole place could go up.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.212
- That'd be game over.
- Chris, lock.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.474
I'm already on it.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.956
They're running out
of air in there.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.045
I'm getting it.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.046
Come on, Chris.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.178
Almost there.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.876
Okay.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.489
We need ventilation.
Chris, Street, open the doors.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.621
Tan, kill the gas.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.014
We got to get them outside.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.102
We need medics
with O2 right away,

08:58.146 --> 08:59.800
our location.

09:01.366 --> 09:02.759
No, get it off me.

09:02.803 --> 09:03.760
Get it off.

09:03.804 --> 09:04.805
Hey, hey, relax.

09:04.848 --> 09:05.849
Keep your mask on. You need it.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.285
No, I need to tell you,

09:07.329 --> 09:09.200
h-he's dangerous.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.855
Okay, okay. Just slow down,
take it easy. We're listening.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.336
One of my postgrads, Joseph,

09:14.379 --> 09:17.339
he had the students make
a chemical called diflouro.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.775
It's deadly.

09:18.819 --> 09:21.386
As he left, he said,

09:21.430 --> 09:22.823
"All of them would die today."

09:22.866 --> 09:25.652
"All of them"? All of them who?

09:25.695 --> 09:29.046
I don't know.
But you got to stop him.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.395
With what Joseph took,

09:30.439 --> 09:33.398
he could kill thousands.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.267
This is our guy, Joseph Reid.

10:16.311 --> 10:17.965
British citizen.
Four years into his doctorate

10:18.008 --> 10:19.967
- in chemistry.
- Assume we've already got a BOLO out?

10:20.010 --> 10:22.317
The moment the university
gave us his photo and file.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.754
60-Squad hit his apartment,
Becker should be back

10:24.798 --> 10:26.277
any minute with a report.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.018
What about this chemical
he had the students make?

10:28.062 --> 10:30.325
On paper, it's tightly
controlled, illegal to possess.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.674
The ER released

10:31.718 --> 10:32.762
Professor Winter,
he's on his way in.

10:32.806 --> 10:33.763
He'll obviously know more.

10:33.807 --> 10:34.808
That man looked spooked,

10:34.851 --> 10:36.505
like this stuff is no joke.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.072
Yeah, and with what happened
to those students,

10:38.115 --> 10:39.290
Joseph's already proven
he's willing to kill.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.596
He already has killed.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.337
No sign of Joseph Reid
at his apartment,

10:42.380 --> 10:44.469
but we found
his roommate dead, gunshot.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.471
Looked like maybe it
happened this morning.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.822
The deceased is the one
on the left, Robert Li.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.606
The one on the right is the
other roommate, Mark Rodgers.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.912
He's missing.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.740
He probably got the hell
out of Dodge.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.263
Our suspect, Joseph
Reid, was working

10:55.306 --> 10:57.439
four years plus
hoping to get a PhD.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.876
And this last week, university
dropped him from the program.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.878
So we think this is part
of a plan to get back at them?

11:01.922 --> 11:04.011
Look, he wouldn't be
the first academic to go postal.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.447
I already alerted the FBI.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.796
They're working on
a threat assessment

11:06.840 --> 11:08.319
focused on the campus.
Now, with finals week

11:08.363 --> 11:09.930
in progress,
graduation days away,

11:09.973 --> 11:12.715
I want to put an end
to this ASAP.

11:12.759 --> 11:16.023
I would have never before
labeled Joseph as dangerous.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.502
A Cambridge grad,

11:17.546 --> 11:19.069
impeccable academic record.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.855
And he was as smart and
focused as advertised.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.205
When did you start to notice
a change in his behavior?

11:24.248 --> 11:27.034
About six months ago.
He stopped completing his work,

11:27.077 --> 11:28.905
shut himself off from
his students, it was all

11:28.949 --> 11:31.516
very strange,
- very disappointing.
- Did he ever say

11:31.560 --> 11:33.693
anything that might shed light
on what happened?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.346
No. I reached out to him,

11:35.390 --> 11:36.957
hoping that he would let me in
on whatever it was,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.177
whether it was-was burnout
or breakdown from stress,

11:40.221 --> 11:42.484
but he just became
more detached.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.791
Ultimately, we had no choice but
to drop him from the program.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.358
Tell us more about

11:47.402 --> 11:49.143
this chemical compound
he created this morning.

11:49.186 --> 11:52.537
Methylphosphonyl difluoride,
more simply known as DF.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.931
It is one of
two ingredients

11:54.975 --> 11:56.324
in the binary nerve agent soman.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.673
Wait, wait, h-hold on.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.719
You really think
he's making nerve gas?

11:59.762 --> 12:01.155
DF has little use
outside of chemical warfare.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.678
That's why
it's so strictly controlled.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.985
You said that there
were two ingredients.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.464
Yes, but unfortunately,

12:06.508 --> 12:08.292
DF is the more difficult one
to acquire.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.033
The other one is
a more common alcohol

12:10.077 --> 12:11.687
used in certain
hospital applications.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.734
So Joseph may already have
the ingredients he needs.

12:16.474 --> 12:20.130
I can't stress enough how
dangerous this nerve agent is.

12:20.174 --> 12:23.394
Any contact with the liquid
or its vapors, whether

12:23.438 --> 12:25.048
it's ingested, inhaled

12:25.092 --> 12:29.052
or simply on the skin,
it is almost certain death.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.054
And if Joseph is able

12:31.098 --> 12:32.621
to aerosolize it?

12:32.664 --> 12:33.883
Well, like I told you earlier...

12:35.276 --> 12:38.018
...the death toll
could be in the thousands.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.324
I just got confirmation
that Joseph Reid has the ability

12:40.368 --> 12:41.761
to make the nerve agent soman.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.719
A single drop can be deadly.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.460
There's a chance he has what
he needs to make gallons of it.

12:45.503 --> 12:46.940
Then we need to find him,

12:46.983 --> 12:48.419
or at least figure out
what his target is.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.899
Any sign of the missing
roommate, Mark Rodgers?

12:49.943 --> 12:51.596
If he's still alive,
he might know something.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.076
Rodgers is still MIA,

12:53.120 --> 12:54.425
but his father lives in Reseda.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.949
Alonso, you and Hondo
pay him a visit.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.559
Check the campus hospital, too.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.300
The only other ingredient
he needs is common alcohol.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.823
They should have it there.
I'll grab Street and go.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.172
All right, do it.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.739
In the meantime,
I want to dig deeper

13:03.783 --> 13:05.262
into what we know about Joseph.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.742
What, you think we're
missing something?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.266
I'm not sure,
but I want to find out.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.184
I don't know how you knew,
but I cross-checked intake logs

13:14.228 --> 13:16.230
with our inventory
like you asked,

13:16.273 --> 13:17.753
and there's a discrepancy
in the alcohol stores

13:17.797 --> 13:19.233
by several gallons.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.365
Do you recognize this man?

13:21.409 --> 13:22.976
We think he may be
the one responsible.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.804
No, never seen him, sorry.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.675
What about the area
where you store the chemicals?

13:26.718 --> 13:29.330
You must have video
surveillance, right?

13:29.373 --> 13:30.897
We're gonna need
to see the tapes.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.550
Right this way.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.988
You got any vacation plans

13:35.031 --> 13:36.685
before taking over
Mama Pina's safe house?

13:36.728 --> 13:39.688
I wish. But with the state
Mama Pina's in, there's no time.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.733
Those women need help now.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.171
I'm proud of you,
Chris. You know that.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.129
I wouldn't normally celebrate
one of my best leaving,

13:46.173 --> 13:48.871
but I know you're gonna
be an even bigger asset

13:48.915 --> 13:50.481
to this city with
what you're doing.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.179
I hope so.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.224
Weird to think I'm just gonna
be a civilian, though.

14:04.974 --> 14:08.021
Mr. Rodgers, LAPD.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.023
We need to have a word
with you about your son.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.981
Cops are out front.
Mark, go to the door.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.200
Do whatever
you have to

14:13.243 --> 14:14.418
to get rid of them
while we load up.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.769
Come on. Hurry, hurry.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.644
Here.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.211
This guy, he's dressed
like a hospital worker,

14:24.254 --> 14:26.343
but I've never seen him
on this floor before.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.867
Can't see his face.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.217
You have other cameras.
Can you track him?

14:30.260 --> 14:31.566
There.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.481
Isolate the elevator.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.140
That's the missing roommate,
Mark Rodgers.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.924
He's in on it.

14:44.274 --> 14:45.536
It's Street.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.931
Hey, sorry I took so long.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.498
I was, I was in the back.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.934
Um, what can I
help you with?

14:51.978 --> 14:54.328
Mark Rodgers,
we've been looking for you.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.025
Hondo, he's part of it!

14:57.287 --> 14:58.506
Drop-- drop it!

14:58.549 --> 14:59.594
Drop it right now!

15:02.553 --> 15:03.903
It got on me.

15:03.946 --> 15:04.904
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.688
Chris, stay away from him.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.646
Help me.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.519
- Do something. Please!
- No, Chris.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.564
Stay back.

15:16.741 --> 15:17.742
Stay with him.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.179
Don't let anybody touch him.

15:23.531 --> 15:24.706
LAPD!

15:35.935 --> 15:39.721
20-David to Command.
We got it all wrong.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.810
Joseph isn't some lone nut
after his professors.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.507
He's got accomplices.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.032
This is something much bigger
than we bargained for.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.343
Two people from different parts
of the world

15:53.387 --> 15:54.475
conspiring to commit
the same crime.

15:54.518 --> 15:55.780
What the hell's the connection?

15:55.824 --> 15:57.434
All indications
point to Afghanistan.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.436
Now, as far as I can tell,
the two men met

15:59.480 --> 16:01.264
when they were both arrested
by campus police

16:01.308 --> 16:02.918
during a student protest when
the U.S. pulled their forces

16:02.962 --> 16:04.746
out of Afghanistan last August.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.053
That's about the time Joseph's
PhD work started to falter.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.706
University never
pressed charges,

16:08.750 --> 16:10.012
so there was nothing
in Joseph's file.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.883
Joseph's a British citizen.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.450
He is. His father's British,
but his mother's Afghan.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.495
He spent most of his life
going back and forth

16:14.538 --> 16:16.018
between London and Kabul.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.759
Okay, so I-I get
Joseph's connection,

16:17.802 --> 16:19.761
but how does this
Mark Rodgers kid fit in?

16:19.804 --> 16:21.067
Well, Mark's brother, Brandon,

16:21.110 --> 16:23.199
he served in U.S.
Army in Afghanistan.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.375
He was killed in action.20-year war, no victory,

16:25.419 --> 16:27.029
local allies left behind.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.509
More than enough bad
feelings to go around.

16:28.552 --> 16:29.945
My best guess
is that Mark is angry

16:29.989 --> 16:31.947
about his brother's death,
he meets Joseph,

16:31.991 --> 16:33.166
who shares similar rage.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.645
Well, either way,
Hondo was right.

16:34.689 --> 16:35.864
This is much bigger
than just a student

16:35.907 --> 16:37.387
pissed off at the university.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.476
Evidence recovered from
their makeshift lab

16:39.520 --> 16:42.175
suggests they may have as
many as six of these devices.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.741
And we still don't know what
they plan to do with them,

16:43.785 --> 16:45.395
- or who they'll target.
- Uh, FBI's already widening

16:45.439 --> 16:47.180
their threat assessment
to include the whole city.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.529
This much nerve agent
on the loose,

16:48.572 --> 16:50.313
we need to prepare
for the worst.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.670
Feeling all right?

17:01.542 --> 17:03.892
Just thinking about how close
I came to being one of those

17:03.935 --> 17:06.721
sad stories of a cop
killed on the last day.

17:06.764 --> 17:09.898
That was never gonna happen.

17:09.941 --> 17:12.335
Yeah, because you
didn't let it happen.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.685
Your call saved my life.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.645
Well, I will start thinking of
ways you can make it up to me.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.305
Chem suits?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.568
Hate those things.
I sweat like a pig.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.092
After what I saw today,
I might wear mine right now.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.355
Yeah, Hicks wants them
loaded in Black Betty.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.878
Oh, and check these out.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.184
Some kind of antidote?

17:35.228 --> 17:36.577
If it's injected
fast enough.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.187
That's the idea, anyway.

17:38.231 --> 17:41.060
Street, do you mind
if I have a quick word with Tan?

17:41.103 --> 17:42.278
Yeah.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.019
Thanks.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.507
I know you're not looking
to spar right now.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.943
No, they're a
"going away" present.

17:54.986 --> 17:57.424
My idea was, they're
more than just gloves,

17:57.467 --> 17:59.904
they're a symbol of
how you looked after me

17:59.948 --> 18:02.081
when I was drinking too much
after Erica died.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.126
You encouraged me to
get back in the ring

18:04.170 --> 18:05.606
and punch out that anger,

18:05.649 --> 18:07.738
and, uh...

18:07.782 --> 18:09.044
when I look back
at all our times together,

18:09.088 --> 18:10.915
that's what I remember most.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.613
Well, I'm really
gonna miss having

18:12.656 --> 18:14.484
my favorite sparring
partner around.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.053
All right,
that's enough.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.448
This is getting way sappier
than I wanted it to be.

18:22.623 --> 18:23.798
Deac!

18:23.841 --> 18:25.408
Techs pulled a print
from the lab

18:25.452 --> 18:27.584
Hondo and Chris uncovered
at the Rodgers house.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.934
It doesn't belong
to Rodgers or Joseph Reid.

18:29.978 --> 18:31.806
So we got an ID
on a third suspect?

18:31.849 --> 18:33.808
Name's Mateen Rozi.
He's had a couple

18:33.851 --> 18:35.723
of minor arrests, no LKA.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.291
Employment history says he does
delivery for an Afghan cafe

18:38.334 --> 18:39.596
down on Olympic.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.902
All right, we'll
go check it out.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.180
TAIMUR:Friends and family of our
community who've gone missing

18:58.224 --> 19:00.661
back home since the Taliban
assumed full control.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.838
But that's not why you're here.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.970
I'm Sergeant Harrelson,
this is Sergeant Kay.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.537
We're looking for one of
your delivery drivers.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.886
Mateen Rozi.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.888
I haven't seen Mateen in weeks.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.760
But it's not unusual.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.892
It's important that we talk
to him. Do you have an address?

19:14.936 --> 19:16.459
No address, but, uh, he was

19:16.503 --> 19:18.983
in a fender bender
recently, right out front.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.247
I had to get all his car info
for the insurance claim.

19:23.945 --> 19:27.209
Sir, would you say
that Mateen is political?

19:27.253 --> 19:30.908
More I would say, uh,
conflicted, angry.

19:30.952 --> 19:34.216
Like so many others whose
country has seen decades of war.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.870
Thank you.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.567
I'm gonna put out a BOLO.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.178
Did you ever see Mateen

19:39.221 --> 19:42.311
hanging around with either
of these men?

19:42.355 --> 19:44.008
Sure, that's Joseph
on the right.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.314
He used to come in here a lot

19:45.358 --> 19:46.924
to send money
back to his family.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.188
I'm sorry, why-why here?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.754
When the U.S. left

19:50.798 --> 19:53.104
and the Taliban took over,
traditional banking

19:53.148 --> 19:54.932
and money-wiring services
were corrupted.

19:54.976 --> 19:58.022
But I still have ways
to send money back home.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.502
You're part of a hawala.

19:59.546 --> 20:02.375
Exactly. You're familiar.

20:02.418 --> 20:05.334
Yeah. But you said
that he <i>used</i> to send money.

20:05.378 --> 20:09.338
Yes, until his family were
all killed a few months ago.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.601
Was inevitable, probably.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.429
Joseph's uncle
was an interpreter

20:13.473 --> 20:15.214
for a unit of Marines.

20:15.257 --> 20:18.347
Despite many promises that they
would be brought to the U.S.,

20:18.391 --> 20:20.262
they were
ultimately left behind.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.397
Joseph blames the U.S.,

20:24.440 --> 20:26.834
but it was the Taliban
who showed them no mercy.

20:28.966 --> 20:31.012
Thank you for your time.

20:33.057 --> 20:35.799
You know, looking at this
from Joseph's eyes,

20:35.843 --> 20:38.280
the U.S. is responsible
for the death of his family.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.542
Yeah, when they get
left behind by the pullout,

20:39.586 --> 20:41.588
he starts to spiral.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.590
His university studies suffer...

20:43.633 --> 20:46.114
And when they're killed,
he snaps.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.464
Commander?

20:48.508 --> 20:51.032
The BOLO on Mateen Rozi's car
just paid off.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.381
That fast? How's that possible?

20:52.425 --> 20:54.035
License plates
are automatically scanned

20:54.078 --> 20:56.037
when you enter the
Federal Building parking lot.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.344
It flagged the system
less than a minute ago.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.607
I already got
20- and 60-Squads rolling.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.478
Roger that.
We'll meet them there.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.311
- What do we got?
- We found Mateen's car.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.792
Still hot. No sign of him or
Joseph. Maybe he's still inside.

21:11.835 --> 21:12.793
How many people in the building?

21:12.836 --> 21:14.098
Close to a thousand.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.448
Evac's underway,
but construction has

21:15.491 --> 21:16.753
the whole north elevator
bank shut down.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.234
Stairwells jammed
like the 405.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.149
Look, I'm not normally spooked,
but I got a bad,

21:21.192 --> 21:22.498
bad feeling
about this one.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.108
Becker's team
is already making entry.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.721
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

21:27.764 --> 21:28.852
All right, we go
three and three,

21:28.896 --> 21:30.376
leapfrog our way up the floors.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.899
Mattis, Lopez, O'Neil,
start on one.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.770
Dizzy, you, me and J.T.
will start on two.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.120
Let's go! Out of the way!
Out of the way!

21:37.470 --> 21:38.471
A million places
to hide a nerve agent,

21:38.514 --> 21:39.907
none of them good.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.300
- Come on, let's go!
- WOMAN:Help!

21:41.343 --> 21:42.692
Somebody help!
Over here!

21:42.736 --> 21:44.346
Help! Something's wrong.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.782
It's jammed. It won't open.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.262
We got you.
Back up away from the door.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.829
Back up.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.007
Three, two, one.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.620
All right, come on, let's go,
- let's go, let's go!
- Let's go! Move, move!

21:57.664 --> 21:59.535
- Move, move, move.
- Away from the building. Go.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.015
- Here we go. Hurry. Quickly.
- Go, go.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.190
Keep going.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.366
Hey, you, brown jacket, hold up.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.237
Let's go.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.590
25-David. Suspect heading
up the north stairs.

22:10.633 --> 22:11.808
- Brown jacket.
- Move, move, move!

22:13.854 --> 22:14.855
Hands in the air, now!

22:14.898 --> 22:15.943
Turn around.

22:17.597 --> 22:18.946
Mateen Rozi.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.078
Tan.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.430
It's not on him.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.780
What did you do
with the nerve gas?

22:26.823 --> 22:29.348
Timer on his phone's running.
It's got less than four minutes.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.827
What happens in four minutes?

22:30.871 --> 22:32.873
Stick around, find out.

22:32.916 --> 22:36.311
Hondo, there're still
hundreds of people in there.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.617
We don't have time
to get them all out.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.706
Then I guess we're going in.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.540
Let go of me.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.370
There're hundreds of innocent
people in this building.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.284
If they die, you die.
It's that simple.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.416
You can't do this.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.852
Your clock's
ticking, Mateen.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.114
You got under a minute
unless you tell me

22:57.158 --> 22:58.681
where you planted the nerve gas.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.857
I saw what this stuff
did to your buddy Mark.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.903
It's a bad way to go, man.
Tell me where it is.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.428
All right, all right.
It's on the fourth floor.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.038
There's a planter box
by the elevators.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.910
Where else?
What about the others?

23:09.953 --> 23:11.955
T-That's-- That's it.
I just brought the one.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.436
20-David to 60-David.
You're looking for a planter box

23:14.480 --> 23:16.003
near the fourth floor elevators.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.397
Copy that, Hondo. Searching.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.926
I found it. I got it here.

23:27.710 --> 23:28.885
There's a timer.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.017
<i>How do we stop it?</i>

23:30.060 --> 23:30.974
How do we
shut it down?

23:31.018 --> 23:32.672
There's a yellow valve.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.413
You hear that, Becker?
It's the yellow valve.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.895
60-David. The valve's shut.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.419
Device is secured.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.468
Security footage confirms it.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.209
He came alone with
just the one device.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.645
Means this was little
more than a distraction.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.081
There are still
five devices out there.

24:00.308 --> 24:02.136
The suspect's phone is a burner.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.920
There's only one phone number
in the call log.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.008
Well, it's probably Joseph's.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.096
He'd be expecting

24:06.140 --> 24:07.707
a confirmation call about now.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.491
Could be our chance
to chase down the other devices.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.797
I already gave Hicks the number.
He's standing by

24:10.840 --> 24:12.276
to run a trap and
trace if we can

24:12.320 --> 24:13.756
get Joseph to pick up.
It's worth a shot.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.544
Mateen, you're late.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.197
I'm afraid your buddy Mateen's

24:20.241 --> 24:21.590
in federal custody, Joseph.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.549
This is Sergeant Harrelson,
LAPD SWAT.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.767
I thought we could
talk about how

24:24.811 --> 24:25.768
we could put an end
to all of this.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.553
No.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.076
Words are meaningless.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.294
Hey, look, we know
about your uncle.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.687
Your family in Afghanistan.

24:31.731 --> 24:32.949
They promised him.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.256
My uncle helped them for years.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.084
He lived with them,
mourned their losses,

24:37.127 --> 24:38.738
welcomed them into his home.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.130
Then they all left.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.742
They're home now
with their families,

24:42.785 --> 24:44.570
while my uncle

24:44.613 --> 24:47.921
and his family
were left behind to die.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.400
I'm sorry, but they have to pay.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.577
No, Joseph, listen to me, man.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.448
He hung up.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.929
This isn't political.
It's straight revenge.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.104
He wants payback
on the guys

24:57.147 --> 24:58.279
his uncle interpreted for.

24:58.322 --> 24:59.759
The cafe owner said that
his uncle

24:59.802 --> 25:01.456
was embedded with a Marine unit.
There's a Martine

25:01.500 --> 25:03.197
recruiting office on the
fourth floor of this building.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.764
Well, maybe that's why he sent
Mateen here, but Joseph's

25:04.807 --> 25:06.548
going after the unit
that his uncle worked for.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.681
It's got to be stateside,
somewhere local.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.465
Command to D-team.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.075
Go for D-team.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.034
Joseph turned off his phone
once the call ended,

25:14.077 --> 25:16.079
but we had it long enough
to know he's on the 710,

25:16.123 --> 25:18.081
headed towards Long Beach.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.257
Uh, Commander,
we think that Joseph

25:20.301 --> 25:21.737
is going after the Marine unit

25:21.781 --> 25:22.825
that his uncle worked with
in Afghanistan.

25:22.869 --> 25:24.261
Copy that, Deac.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.394
Get 20- and 60-Squads
heading south.

25:26.437 --> 25:27.569
I'll try to get you

25:27.613 --> 25:28.875
the information on the fly.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.441
- Roger that.
- Move.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.184
Come on... Everything all right?

25:34.228 --> 25:36.099
Nichelle's chaperoning
a group of high school kids

25:36.143 --> 25:37.492
in Long Beach,
an exhibit on the <i>Queen Mary.</i>

25:37.536 --> 25:38.841
I can't reach her.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.408
No cell signal
if she's below decks.

25:43.454 --> 25:44.891
From Hicks.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.632
"Joseph's uncle worked
with 5th Battalion,

25:46.675 --> 25:48.372
"22nd Division. The
unit's taking part

25:48.416 --> 25:50.070
"in a celebration today,

25:50.113 --> 25:53.290
"watching Navy ships
come in for Fleet Week.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.249
From the deck
of the <i>Queen Mary."</i>

25:58.818 --> 26:00.776
Hey, Pop, Pop, listen
to me. Is there any chance

26:00.820 --> 26:02.430
Nichelle stayed home today?

26:02.473 --> 26:05.172
No, she was taking those kids,
remember? Why?

26:05.215 --> 26:06.565
I can't explain right now.

26:06.608 --> 26:07.653
No, son, wait a minute.

26:07.696 --> 26:08.610
I hear something in your voice.

26:08.654 --> 26:09.655
Is Nichelle in trouble?

26:09.698 --> 26:11.134
Pop, I don't know. I got to go.

26:11.178 --> 26:12.353
No, no, listen, damn it.

26:12.396 --> 26:13.702
There's something
you need to know.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.054
It's the reason she wants
to take you away this weekend.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.403
She wants to tell you.

26:19.447 --> 26:20.970
Tell me what, Pop?

26:22.406 --> 26:23.756
She's pregnant, son.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.194
Sh-She's pregnant?

26:27.237 --> 26:29.500
I accidentally found a test
in one of her boxes.

26:29.544 --> 26:32.460
Now, she made me promise
not to tell you, but...

26:32.503 --> 26:33.940
you got to find her, son.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.405
All right, Chris, Tan,
we're gonna need eyes up high.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.276
Move.
TAN:On it.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.192
Hey, how do you want to work it?

27:09.236 --> 27:10.803
Let's get on that ship
and stage nearby.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.761
You guys lay low.
If we find a device,

27:12.805 --> 27:14.154
your squad will
handle containment.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.330
Go.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.679
Listen, once we get up there,
if you need to take off

27:17.723 --> 27:20.377
and find Nichelle,
we understand.

27:20.421 --> 27:21.596
We got you covered.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.164
Let's just find Joseph.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.253
We put an end to this,
Nichelle will be fine.

27:26.296 --> 27:28.864
Imagine what it would've
been like to pack up

27:28.908 --> 27:31.432
everything you own
and set off across the ocean.

27:31.475 --> 27:35.479
Maybe with nobody waiting
for you on the other side.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.481
I don't know.
Doesn't sound so bad.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.788
Come here
on a seven-day cruise?

27:39.832 --> 27:43.052
I don't think it was quite as
luxurious as you're picturing.

27:43.096 --> 27:46.012
I think it was a
long, tough voyage

27:46.055 --> 27:47.709
until they arrived
at Ellis Island.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.407
Which we'll hear about next.

28:24.441 --> 28:25.747
That's a lot of people.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.531
Evacuation routes
are really limited.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.751
Means it'll be bad news if
one of those canisters go off.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.274
Then we know what
we need to do.

28:31.318 --> 28:32.493
All right, Becker,
y'all stand by.

28:32.536 --> 28:33.755
If we find anything...

28:33.799 --> 28:34.930
Give me the signal,
we'll come running.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.236
Let's move.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.084
Tan, 11 o'clock,
by the red pop-up.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.042
The guy dressed
as a maintenance worker.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.522
25-David.
Suspects sighted near the stage.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.611
Green maintenance jackets,
baseball caps.

29:03.654 --> 29:04.830
They just put a device
in a trash can.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.092
That's got be how
they're hiding them.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.702
20-David to 60-David.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.008
They are targeting trash cans.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.357
I need your team
to handle containment.

29:12.533 --> 29:13.926
Hondo, your ten,
near the rails.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.146
Joseph! Stop right there!

29:25.981 --> 29:27.548
LAPD! Out of the way!

29:28.854 --> 29:31.508
LAPD! Deacon,
you and Street go left.

29:31.552 --> 29:32.683
We've got Joseph.

29:34.381 --> 29:36.165
Out of the way.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.999
60-David.
One device deactivated.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.915
Spread out and search.
Check every trash can.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.660
LAPD! Drop the weapon!

29:53.835 --> 29:55.358
- You good?
- Good.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.882
Go. I'll double back.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.898
Joseph is headed
to the port side.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.378
STREET:Copy. We're on Bedar,
heading starboard.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.082
- Going hands-on.
- Go.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.653
30-David.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.568
One suspect down.

30:35.094 --> 30:36.182
22-David.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.183
In pursuit along the outer deck,

30:37.226 --> 30:39.185
headed toward the stern.

30:39.228 --> 30:41.230
Roger, Luca. Headed that way.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.019
Give it up, Joseph!

30:47.062 --> 30:48.107
It's over, man!

30:51.937 --> 30:53.764
- Get on your knees!
- On your knees! Drop your gun!

30:53.808 --> 30:55.854
Down on the ground!
Drop the gun!

30:55.897 --> 30:57.812
- Down on the ground!
- On your knees!

31:00.119 --> 31:02.686
Give me your hands.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.732
Canister's gone.

31:04.775 --> 31:05.994
He had it
a second ago.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.213
Where is it?

31:07.256 --> 31:08.692
He must have ditched it.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.042
Where'd you put the device?

31:10.085 --> 31:11.957
Hondo! Damn it,
he dropped it in.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.088
Can you reach it?

31:13.132 --> 31:14.916
No, it fell down into the ship.

31:17.353 --> 31:18.789
How long till it goes?

31:18.833 --> 31:20.226
How long?

31:25.013 --> 31:26.319
Hey, it's got to be 30
feet down from the markings

31:26.362 --> 31:27.755
on the shaft,
maybe three levels?

31:27.798 --> 31:29.061
I can't see the timer.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.758
Hondo, if the gas
releases in there...

31:30.801 --> 31:32.586
Whole ship becomes
- a death chamber. Okay,

31:32.629 --> 31:34.370
there's light coming in
close by. Must be a vent.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.719
All right, maybe that's good.
It might give us a chance

31:35.763 --> 31:37.460
to get to it before
it's too late.

31:37.504 --> 31:40.028
Get him out of here.
Start evac'ing the ship now.

31:40.072 --> 31:41.421
And send Becker's team in.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.771
Luca, we don't have
time to wait. Go.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.991
Listen up, I need
everyone to get outside.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.254
Clear the area,
right now. Let's go.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.256
Look, we need to go
- down another level.
- Hondo, what's going on?

31:50.299 --> 31:52.258
Baby, you might be in danger.
I need you to get outside,

31:52.301 --> 31:53.607
off the ship, right away.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.522
I can't without my kids.
What's happening?

31:55.565 --> 31:57.219
Hondo.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.917
Get them and go.
As fast as you can.

32:10.319 --> 32:11.799
Over there, over there.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.714
Yeah, I see it. That one.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.459
There it is.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.554
All right, the timer's armed.

32:27.597 --> 32:28.990
Under a minute. I think
I can get to it if I climb in,

32:29.034 --> 32:31.471
but this vent's too narrow
all tac'd up.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.603
I got to get this gear off.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.562
- Luca, what're you doing?
- I'm going in after it.

32:35.605 --> 32:36.998
No, stand down. I'll do it.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.217
No way. You just found out
you're gonna be a dad.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.566
Has to be me.

32:39.609 --> 32:41.481
There's no time
to argue about it.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.966
It's getting narrow in here.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.318
I can't quite reach it.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.233
Ah... We don't have
a lot of time, Luca.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.844
Look, the shutoff valve's
just out of reach.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.326
You got the antidote pen on you?

33:00.369 --> 33:01.762
No, h-hold up, Luca.
What are you thinking?

33:03.242 --> 33:04.895
I can maybe grab
the release pin,

33:04.939 --> 33:06.723
- but it's probably gonna get me.
- No! No, no way, Luca.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.160
- That is a bad plan.
- Look, it's the only plan.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.205
There's not enough time
left for anything else.

33:10.249 --> 33:12.033
Luca, don't do it.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.992
Luca!

33:19.258 --> 33:20.520
It's closed, but it got me.
Get me out of here.

33:20.563 --> 33:21.956
Luca!

33:24.045 --> 33:25.829
All right, I got you, man,

33:25.873 --> 33:27.440
I got you.

33:32.749 --> 33:35.056
Luca. Luca.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.667
Hang in there, man, hang in
there. Come on, man. Luca.

33:37.711 --> 33:38.973
Luca, come on.
Fight, fight, fight.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.844
Come on,
come on, come on.

33:40.888 --> 33:41.889
Come back to me.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.499
Hang in there, man.
Come on.

33:43.543 --> 33:44.805
Yeah, t-there he is.
There he is.

33:44.848 --> 33:48.287
Luca. Luca.
Luca, Luca.

33:54.510 --> 33:56.121
We did it.

33:56.164 --> 33:59.298
No. No, you did it, man.

33:59.341 --> 34:00.386
You did it.

34:13.268 --> 34:14.530
Nichelle.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.316
Hondo, I got to get
these kids home.

34:17.359 --> 34:18.578
Their parents
are freaking out.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.364
All right.
We'll talk when I get home.

34:22.408 --> 34:23.670
I love you.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.280
Thanks.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.245
It's a hell
of a last day.

34:33.288 --> 34:35.551
Tell me you're not gonna
miss this all this.

34:35.595 --> 34:38.206
A day like today? Not one bit.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.298
If it's all right, I, uh...

34:43.342 --> 34:47.520
I'd rather just get this
over with. Not, uh...

34:47.563 --> 34:50.827
Not make a big deal out of it,
you know what I mean?

34:50.871 --> 34:52.916
I know.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.049
You know, if I thought there
was any way to get you to stay,

34:55.093 --> 34:56.964
I'd do it.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.009
But you're
a legacy at SWAT,

34:59.053 --> 35:01.273
and that's
not going anywhere.

35:01.316 --> 35:03.188
That said...

35:04.232 --> 35:06.060
...I'm gonna miss you.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.543
Thank you, sir.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.243
Thank you.

35:22.816 --> 35:25.166
Ah, I was
getting worried.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.734
You're the only one
who didn't come check on me.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.997
I was waiting to get you alone.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.694
Just gave Hicks

35:31.738 --> 35:33.957
my gun and badge.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.394
I got something for you.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.398
I've been dreading
this moment all day.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.400
If I start crying,
it's just the aftereffects

35:41.443 --> 35:43.184
of the nerve gas, that's all.

35:46.535 --> 35:49.756
My very first day on SWAT,
ten years ago,

35:49.799 --> 35:53.281
I was heading out
after one of our shifts,

35:53.325 --> 35:55.370
feeling like an outsider,

35:55.414 --> 35:57.720
like I would never be
part of the team.

35:59.331 --> 36:00.767
And you asked me
if I wanted to grab a bite.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.334
- Remember that day?
- I remember that.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.162
We went to that funny
little Chinese place

36:04.205 --> 36:05.859
down on Spring Street.

36:05.902 --> 36:09.819
You could tell, you were feeling
a little unsure of yourself.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.299
I was freaking out,

36:11.343 --> 36:14.476
wondering if I made a mistake
leaving K-9.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.436
But you, um,

36:17.479 --> 36:20.178
you told me to give it time.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.137
That if I trusted in it,

36:23.181 --> 36:24.965
I'd grow to love it.

36:30.405 --> 36:31.885
What's that?

36:31.928 --> 36:35.149
It's the fortune I got
in my cookie that night.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.459
You kept it all these years?

36:42.025 --> 36:43.244
Yeah.

36:48.249 --> 36:52.297
"With trust and faith
in friends...

36:52.340 --> 36:54.734
...friends become family."

37:08.878 --> 37:10.402
Nichelle.

37:10.445 --> 37:11.794
You all right?

37:11.838 --> 37:12.969
I'm just learning now
from the news

37:13.013 --> 37:14.710
how bad things
could've gone today.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.669
Well, baby, I ain't gonna
lie. I was worried sick

37:16.712 --> 37:18.279
knowing that you were
that close to all of it.

37:18.323 --> 37:21.369
But you and SWAT saved the day.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.328
That's got to feel pretty good.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.417
Not as good as this feels.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.245
NICHELLE:What?

37:27.288 --> 37:28.724
What's that smile for?

37:28.768 --> 37:30.944
What, I can't smile
at the woman that I love?

37:33.381 --> 37:34.643
What?

37:34.687 --> 37:36.166
You told him.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.343
Well, maybe I let it slip out.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.909
But you were in danger,

37:39.953 --> 37:41.998
and my concern
got the best of me.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.827
Sorry, baby,
but the cat is out of the bag.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.917
So? Are you excited?

37:47.961 --> 37:49.702
Am I excited?
Look at my face. Yes.

37:49.745 --> 37:52.139
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.402
Well, the upside of this
is that now that it's not

37:54.446 --> 37:56.796
a secret anymore, there's no
need for a weekend getaway,

37:56.839 --> 37:59.189
which was probably
only an excuse

37:59.233 --> 38:01.322
so y'all wouldn't have
to help me move.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.671
Okay, you know what, Pop?
You're tripping.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.238
We are taking
that weekend getaway.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.848
But I promise you,
when we get back,

38:05.892 --> 38:07.285
I'll help you pack the boxes.

38:07.328 --> 38:08.460
I'll toast to that.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.463
Here's to family.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.769
Here's to our family.

38:23.388 --> 38:24.780
<i>We're serving</i> <i>
this high-risk warrant</i>

38:24.824 --> 38:26.347
on this guy, big guy.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.522
And we go in.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.698
Next thing he knows,
he is facedown,

38:29.742 --> 38:31.178
cuffed, he can't believe it.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.962
And this is the moment
I'm waiting for,

38:33.006 --> 38:36.183
we pick him up, he turns around
and sees that it's Chris

38:36.226 --> 38:37.880
that has
laid him out flat.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.753
This clown has been taken out
by a woman half his size.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.798
And that might be
my favorite SWAT memory,

38:42.842 --> 38:44.844
and definitely
my favorite Chris story.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.149
I remember that guy.
He was almost in tears

38:46.193 --> 38:47.586
when we handed him off
to patrol.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.762
I think Chris broke him.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.416
All right, how much I owe you?

38:53.026 --> 38:54.506
Hey.

38:54.549 --> 38:55.898
Perfect timing.

38:55.942 --> 38:56.899
Well, it's the least
I could do after today.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.597
Still not loving the risk

38:58.640 --> 38:59.859
that you took, though.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.382
Look, it didn't
make sense for it

39:01.426 --> 39:02.818
to be anybody but me.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.124
I mean, I'm the only member
of this team

39:04.167 --> 39:05.560
without a plus-one, you know?

39:05.604 --> 39:07.519
I mean,
you've got Nichelle.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.216
Deac's got Annie
and the kids.

39:09.259 --> 39:10.565
Probably not a shocker,

39:10.609 --> 39:11.784
but Chris and Street
have each other now.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.394
Yeah.

39:13.438 --> 39:14.743
I don't have anyone
counting on me, so...

39:14.787 --> 39:16.658
That's not true.

39:16.702 --> 39:19.269
Not if you're gonna be
my baby's godfather.

39:21.228 --> 39:22.403
Are you asking me for real?

39:22.447 --> 39:23.970
Assuming everything
goes well.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.406
Nichelle's already signed off.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.017
Luca, we'd be honored
if you said yes.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.194
How about "hell yeah," man?

39:31.238 --> 39:32.805
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.415
That's amazing.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.286
- I love you, man.
- Thank you.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.028
- Yeah.
- I love you, too. You guys.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.467
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.120
- Hey.
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.208
I didn't get the memo
that we were giving gifts.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.340
We're not.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.255
At least, not for me.

39:48.298 --> 39:50.126
I, uh, gave everyone
a little something today,

39:50.170 --> 39:51.563
and...

39:51.606 --> 39:54.000
this one's for you.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.089
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.312
It's the <i>Queen Mary.</i>

40:03.749 --> 40:06.534
Oh, a mini cruise ship.
Good gift.

40:06.578 --> 40:08.841
You gave me advice

40:08.884 --> 40:10.930
during that cruise ship
hijacking a few years ago,

40:10.973 --> 40:12.845
and you told me

40:12.888 --> 40:15.848
relationships weren't
impossible with this job.

40:15.891 --> 40:18.851
So the ship's supposed
to be a reminder

40:18.894 --> 40:21.636
of that and all the journeys
we've been on since then.

40:21.680 --> 40:25.118
I mean, look how
far we've all come.

40:25.161 --> 40:26.772
Yeah.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.295
Now, wait a second.

40:28.338 --> 40:29.862
I know what you got me,

40:29.905 --> 40:33.256
what you got Luca
and Tan and now Hondo.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.084
What'd you get Street?

40:37.478 --> 40:38.958
Street gets me.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.699
LUCA:Ah, aww.

40:40.742 --> 40:42.614
Only had to
wait five years.

40:44.703 --> 40:47.053
Hey, guys, listen up.

40:47.096 --> 40:49.490
I know you all have heard
plenty of speeches from me,

40:49.534 --> 40:54.582
but... none ever
as heartfelt as this one.

40:54.626 --> 40:56.584
A lot of people
talk about legacy,

40:56.628 --> 40:58.717
few people live it.

41:00.283 --> 41:03.896
But Chris Alonso,
you're one of those.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.725
You got to be a good
officer to do this job.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.509
But an even better human being
to do it well,

41:08.553 --> 41:11.120
and to do it
with class.

41:11.164 --> 41:14.733
Christina Alonso, you damn sure
have left your mark

41:14.776 --> 41:15.908
on the LAPD,

41:15.951 --> 41:17.823
and your mark on SWAT.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.346
And you've left
an even deeper mark

41:19.389 --> 41:21.043
with all of us here.

41:22.175 --> 41:23.481
So wherever you go,

41:23.524 --> 41:25.787
whatever you do...

41:26.832 --> 41:28.181
...we will always have your back

41:28.224 --> 41:29.704
because we will
always be together.

41:29.748 --> 41:32.272
♪ Downtown, downtown...

41:32.315 --> 41:34.970
This ain't goodbye.

41:35.014 --> 41:36.189
It's forever.

41:36.232 --> 41:38.191
♪ Downtown, we gonna ride...

41:38.234 --> 41:41.411
To Chris.

41:41.455 --> 41:43.109
♪ Downtown, downtown...

41:43.152 --> 41:44.414
I love you guys.
