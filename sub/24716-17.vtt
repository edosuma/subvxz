-Hey, Sarge.

He took one in the chest.
No sign of a struggle.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.643
My guess, for what it’s worth,

01:00.852 --> 01:03.563
they either took him by surprise,
or they shot him from a distance.

-JOHN JR.: What do we got?
-Name’s Lester Bakewell.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.371
He’s an army recruiter.
Here to make a presentation at the school.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.125
-How did the job come in?
-Security guard heard shots around 7:15.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.204
He was just an outstanding individual,

out there in the open.

We’re Basque.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.517
You... you think
something happened to him?

03:46.851 --> 03:48.978
It’s not like him to be missing
for four days.

-Well, where does he live?
-Shelters, mostly.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.151
-He’s homeless?
-Yeah, he lost his apartment

03:55.235 --> 03:58.821
two years ago. He had a stroke,
and the hospital bills cleaned him out.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.990
I... I’ve begged him
to stay with me, he won’t.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.243
Is there any one particular part of town
he stays in?

I... I give him clothes
if he’ll take them.

his MetroCard has money on it.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.711

he might have gone to see?

No, I’m all the family
he’s got in this country.

would wanna hurt him?

if he’s been treated in an emergency room.

we’re gonna find him.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.540
Too soon to tell.
It could have been an aborted robbery.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.417
Somebody looking
to steal audio-visual equipment

04:52.542 --> 04:54.252
could've found it
without a soldier standing guard.

for the most part peaceful.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.423
Uh... What part wasn’t peaceful?

was killed In Iraq four months ago.

what I guess you could consider threats.

Although, I didn’t take them seriously
at the time.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.519

had access to firearms?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.356
Last month, he got into an argument
with a classmate

05:56.439 --> 05:59.817

We suspended him for two weeks.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.402

a gun in their apartment.

I appreciate that.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.525
So, what do we do now?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.944
Why don't you stick your head in there,
tell him to get off his feet,

10:54.195 --> 10:56.197
and then we’ll get back to him
in a little while, all right?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.240
That way, he starts thinking
that we’re both his friends.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.284
Yeah, well that’s the last thing
I want him thinking.

-I don’t want to go in there.
-Yeah, I’ll go in. I...

11:21.889 --> 11:24.141
I just wish I had a change of clothes
back at the house.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.603
Oh, so havin' a change of clothes
at the house brings it around to me?

11:27.853 --> 11:28.896
Did I say that?

12:27.329 --> 12:29.165
but I think you look great in a uniform.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.624

I thought I'd take care of it.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.388
Nothing wrong with wanting to visit, Andy.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.057

Nothing so far.

-About 6:30.
-Where was your son when you left?

Sleeping in his bed.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.720
He’s not the easiest kid
in the world to wake up in the morning.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.306
-You own a gun?
-ED: I have an old hunting rifle.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.432

-Remington 3006.

-Your son ever talk to you

14:59.523 --> 15:00.941
about how he felt toward the army?

15:01.525 --> 15:03.402
What he says,
he says because of his brother.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.613
-What does he say?
-You gotta understand,

15:05.696 --> 15:08.282
Brian was who he looked up to
more than me.

-Brian was everything to this kid.
-Does Paul know how to use a gun?

He learned in the boy scouts.
But I'm telling you, this is not...

15:13.954 --> 15:16.707
What are the circumstances
surrounding his trip to Morocco?

with some student-travel program.

they wanna go there.

if we take a look at your gun?

to take a look at your son’s computer.

-If he’s been associating

we’re gonna know about it.

to help your son is to tell us the truth.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.905
that your son could be concealing
some things from you.

And there ain’t a day that goes by

don’t think of him.

-Does your son?

16:01.877 --> 16:05.089
he would never 'cause another family

-He was all good.

He was looking at a promotion
to master sergeant.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.253
They were gonna send him
to a language school to learn Arabic.

I don’t think he’d want me
broadcasting that all over the place.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.141
Yeah, I’m sure he’d want us
to find out who killed him.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.561

he worked with.

-JOHN JR.: You know her name?
-Angela.

’cause they worked together,

17:05.566 --> 17:06.900
and her divorce wasn’t final.

from the medical examiner.

was gonna happen to him.

from a restaurant. Zazzo.

-You go where the facts take you.
-STEVE: Where the facts have taken us

19:18.115 --> 19:20.701
is, for my money, is to an individual
who fits the profile

19:20.784 --> 19:23.036
of native-born enemy combatant to a "T."

19:23.203 --> 19:25.539
For the life of me, I don’t know
why we’re not staying with that.

we're pursuing other possibilities.

I'd be putting his feet to the fire.

Maybe that’s what you’ll wind up doing.
But for right now,

19:34.756 --> 19:37.092
you need to talk
to Sergeant Payson and her husband.

That’s it.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.356

if he owed anyone money?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.944
-If he was a gambler?
-Neither of those things.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.820
What was the nature
of your relationship to him?

20:38.904 --> 20:41.281
We worked together. We were friends.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.742
That’s it?

20:43.909 --> 20:46.119
I don’t understand
why you’re asking me this.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.413
We received information
that the two of you were having an affair.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.831
How is that relevant?

20:51.041 --> 20:54.294
May not be. It just helps us if we have
all the information in front of us,

20:54.378 --> 20:56.421
so that we know what we’re dealing with.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.715
Les and I were seeing each other.

20:59.716 --> 21:02.719
We didn’t plan on it.
We didn’t want it to happen, but it did.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.138
Why didn’t you say anything
about that before?

21:05.430 --> 21:08.225
-I don’t think it’s relevant.
-JOHN JR.: Does your husband know?

21:09.309 --> 21:11.603
My husband and I have been
separated for eight months.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.939
-Our divorce will be final this June.
-Does he know?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.109
-Yes.
-When did he find out?

21:18.026 --> 21:19.194
About a year ago.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.698
He suspected something was going on,
and I didn’t deny it.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.035
I begged him to forgive me. I stopped
seeing Les. I put in for a transfer.

21:27.244 --> 21:31.123
I tried to be a perfect wife,
but I wasn’t one. Not to Carl.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.669
I told him he could have everything.
I was filing for divorce.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.547
-How did he react?
-He was sad.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.382
I was sad.

We’ve both been doing our best
to be civil to each other and...

21:44.720 --> 21:46.179
get on with our lives.

-Retired.

-Where does he live?
-Commack.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.644
We’re gonna need his phone number.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.189
Tell him I'm okay?

-You the manager?
-Won’t have a table until 10:30.

We don’t want a table.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.661
What’s the problem?

22:10.120 --> 22:12.748
-You recognize him?
-No.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.125
We got a report you got into a fight
with him last Tuesday.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.336
-Who said that?
-BALDWIN: Someone who saw you.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.047
Hmm. Wouldn’t be
Carol Burnett's evil twin, would it?

22:20.172 --> 22:21.798
-Who?
-Well, she’s this lunatic

22:21.882 --> 22:22.883
who lives upstairs.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.177
You know, she’s trying to get us
kicked out of the building.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.054
Are you saying
you didn’t have a fight with him?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.555
I’m saying I don’t remember.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.807
See, human flotsam come and go
in the city.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.310
If they make problems for me,
I make problems for them.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.645
I don’t clutter my brain
trying to remember faces.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.397
This guy might have died that night.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.649
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.110
That would make you
the last person to be seen with him.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.113
W... what are you suggesting?
That I killed him?

22:45.280 --> 22:48.116
What possible reason
would I have for doing that?

22:48.575 --> 22:51.036
You should know
that this is a homicide investigation.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.538
That means we’re gonna talk
to your whole staff

22:53.663 --> 22:55.457
and everyone up and down the block.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.085
And if anyone says
that you put your hands on him,

22:58.168 --> 23:00.212
you become suspect number one.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.131
That means if there’s anything you have
to say, now would be the time to say it.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.008
The only thing I have to say

23:05.217 --> 23:07.969
is that I hope this is some
long-lost Rockefeller cousin

23:08.053 --> 23:09.388
or Ron Perlman’s uncle,

23:09.471 --> 23:11.598
’cause I hate to think,
with everything going on in the city,

23:11.681 --> 23:14.601
not to mention Homeland Security,
you guys are spending this much time

23:14.684 --> 23:17.062
trying to figure out
who did what to some bum.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.357
We need a staff list with contact numbers.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.110
Hmm, no response. Duly noted.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

23:39.251 --> 23:40.419
What do you got?

23:40.836 --> 23:42.838
I’m about to write this guy up
for being double-parked.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.173
When he comes out of the building,
he starts in on me.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.676
I give him his warning,
I told him he was gettin' out of line.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.344
When he wouldn’t stop,
I put the cuffs on him.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.596
-When I get my turn?
-I’ll be right with you.

23:51.805 --> 23:52.973
Did he put his hands on you?

23:53.807 --> 23:56.518
-I think it was headed in that direction.
-But it hadn’t happened?

23:56.810 --> 23:57.811
No.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.483
-All right. What’s your story?
-CLARENCE: I work for the medical lab.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.735
I come here every day
to pick up the blood samples

24:05.819 --> 24:08.822
from the doctors’ offices.
It takes me 30 seconds.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.616
I walk in, I grab the box, and I walk out.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.076
What did you say to the officer?

24:13.493 --> 24:15.996
CLARENCE:
I said, "I’m trying to make a livin'."

24:16.163 --> 24:18.331
-That’s it?
-CLARENCE: I tried to show the man respect

24:18.498 --> 24:21.918
when I first came out. I told him,
"I got over 30 stops to make."

24:22.002 --> 24:25.922
"There’s no place to park."
I don’t leave my car but for a minute.

24:26.381 --> 24:29.384
But he don’t listen.
He say, "It’s too late."

24:29.843 --> 24:33.054
-That’s when I got mad.
-All right. Step back here a second.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.057
Come here.

24:37.434 --> 24:40.520
-(SIGHS) Is that true what he said?
-Pretty much.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.564
What do you want to do here?

24:42.939 --> 24:45.442
-What do you mean?
-I mean, do you wanna create a situation?

24:45.567 --> 24:48.695
This is a workin' man.
He’s not stickin' nobody up.

24:48.945 --> 24:51.740
You’re gonna cost him
two days’ wages with that ticket,

24:51.823 --> 24:54.242
and then when he gets mad,
you’re gonna collar him?

24:54.618 --> 24:56.077
What should I have done?

24:56.745 --> 24:58.955
You see him go inside the building,
you wait.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.957
If he’s in there for a while,
then you write him up.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.001
If he comes right back out again,
you talk to him.

25:03.126 --> 25:04.127
What do I say?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.213
Tell him you’re tryin'
to keep traffic movin'.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.298
If he’s a right guy, you be a right guy.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.051
About how long do I wait
while he’s in the building?

25:11.843 --> 25:13.512
(SIGHS) Five minutes.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.306
Yeah, I’m sorry.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.725
It’s the kinda thing you get a feel for
after a while.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.230
-What do I do now?
-Give me the summons.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.570
Now, go over there, take the cuffs off,
tell him to have a nice day.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.239

you’re retired from the military?

25:57.222 --> 25:59.140
-Yeah, army.
-What rank did you retire at?

25:59.266 --> 26:00.267
Light Colonel.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.852
-You heard what happened this morning?
-I did.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.938
-Did you know Sergeant Bakewell?
-Yeah.

26:05.105 --> 26:08.275
-How did you know him?
-No way to say it, but to say it.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.443
He and my soon-to-be ex-wife
were seein' each other.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.405
We have to ask you this,
but where were you

26:13.488 --> 26:14.698
between 7:00 and 8:00 this morning?

26:14.823 --> 26:17.409
I work for the Nassau County Department
of Emergency Management.

26:17.492 --> 26:20.453
From about 7:30 on,
I was observing a preparedness drill

26:20.537 --> 26:22.539
at St. Catherine’s hospital
in Rockville Center.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.124
And there’s people who can vouch for that?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.001
-CARL: Sure.
-It’s just for the report.

26:26.167 --> 26:29.379
-I understand. How’s Angela doin'?
-She’s doin' okay.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.423
I’m awful sorry this has happened.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.758
When’s the last time
you saw Sergeant Bakewell?

26:33.842 --> 26:36.970
I ran into him at Angela's
when I was dropping some things off.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.055
-That would have been about a month ago.
-How was that?

26:39.389 --> 26:41.516
We conducted ourselves like gentlemen.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.102
How are you and your wife
handling the divorce?

26:44.185 --> 26:45.604
We’ve had our moments.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.480
Probably both said some things
we’ve regretted.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.357
But once you come
to the conclusion that the marriage

26:49.441 --> 26:50.942
is really over,
you make your peace with it.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.069
We’re gonna need the names
of those people from the hospital.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.488
I’m gonna have to call you from my office.

outside the restaurant.

that your, uh, fearless manager

27:27.729 --> 27:28.813
was in an altercation with?

Mm-hmm. That’s not
where I recognize him from.

-Uh... He cleans up from midnight to 6:00.

The only thing that was bothering me

28:25.453 --> 28:27.330
was, uh,
they’ve been separated nine months,

28:27.414 --> 28:31.418
he’s still wearing his wedding ring.
May or may not be significant.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.504
Significant. May or may not mean
he committed murder.

about a month ago,

asked if he could work for food.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.539
I heard the accent,
I asked him if he was Basque.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.332
-Is that what you are?
-Right.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.626
So, I said I'd give him somethin' to eat.

30:36.709 --> 30:39.337
He said he had to work for it,
so I told him he could sweep the alley.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.755
He started coming every night.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.383
He’d sweep, and then we’d eat.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.261

talkin' about Orthez.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.181
Where he was from...

30:50.890 --> 30:53.601
you know? Where my grandfather was from.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.772
I even managed to say
a few words to him in Euskara.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.274
That’s a Basque language.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.068
How did he wind up
in the dumpster, Nestor?

31:02.902 --> 31:05.947
Last Tuesday, he came in,
and he said he didn’t feel so good.

31:06.990 --> 31:10.076
So, I told him that he could go lie down
on the cot we keep in the back.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.247
When I went in to check on him,
he was dead.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.085

what I was doing with him.

and I slung his body over my shoulder...

31:28.553 --> 31:30.263
then I carried it out to the dumpster,

31:31.306 --> 31:32.473

threw him in.

as well come back here.

-Who is it?
-He’s a student at the high school.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.630
Why did he do it?

32:03.880 --> 32:05.965
His brother
was killed in Karbala last year.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.509
Now, he got it in his head
that whatever army recruiter

32:08.593 --> 32:11.346
got sent to his school
next deserved to pay the price.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.681
Basically, he became an enemy combatant.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.266
Has he admitted it?

32:15.475 --> 32:17.894
-Not yet.
-Well, how do you know he did it?

32:18.311 --> 32:19.896
Right now, it’s mostly circumstantial.

32:19.979 --> 32:23.024
He had made threats against recruiters
who'd come to the school in the past.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.109
He had access to a high-powered rifle,

32:25.193 --> 32:27.487
which we’re doin'
ballistics comparisons on.

32:27.570 --> 32:28.780
He’d been in Morocco,

32:28.863 --> 32:32.116
and we’re getting some interesting
website traffic from internet records.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.327
That doesn’t prove he did it though.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.579
It gives us enough
for the DA to go to the grand jury.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.582
Which, at this point,
is all our bosses are looking for.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.585
Does that mean his name
will be in the papers?

32:42.669 --> 32:45.797
Hmm. Yeah. It’s...
it's his old man I feel bad for.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.132
You know, one son’s killed,
the other son’s a murderer.

32:53.054 --> 32:56.307
I don’t know
if this is relevant or not, but...

32:57.976 --> 33:00.186
you have to know
something about my husband.

33:00.269 --> 33:04.399
-What’s that?
-He’s been having a tough time.

33:05.066 --> 33:08.152
-With the divorce?
-With the divorce and with me seeing Les.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.321
Uh... That’s not what you said
the last time we talked to you.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.115
I don’t think he would do
anything like this.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.492
All right, when you say "tough time,"
what are we talking about?

33:14.617 --> 33:18.204
Phone calls in the middle of the night,
coming in here and making a scene...

33:18.287 --> 33:19.747
-STEVE: Did he threaten you in any way?
-No.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.542
-Did he threaten Sergeant Bakewell?
-(SIGHS)

33:23.751 --> 33:27.880
He made it pr... pretty clear,
he disapproved of what we were doing.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.675
And I said this wasn’t the place
to discuss that.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.886
He turned and walked out
like it was drill and ceremony.

33:34.053 --> 33:36.973
His face was red.
His eyes were straight ahead.

33:37.223 --> 33:41.185
-Does your husband have a gun?
-(SIGHS) He has a rifle, sir.

33:47.483 --> 33:49.777
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

33:55.033 --> 33:57.493
Hey, we got the report faxed
from the ME's office.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.663
Giuseppe died of a brain aneurysm.

34:01.664 --> 34:03.750
Uh... What about the bruises on his face?

34:03.875 --> 34:06.586
They were likely to have happened
while he was in the dumpster.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.171
We should get the niece in.

34:12.008 --> 34:13.009
JOHN JR.: This way.

34:13.968 --> 34:16.387
I just had a couple more things
to ask you about.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.680
Whatever you need.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.141
JOHN JR.: By the way,
I couldn’t help but notice,

34:20.224 --> 34:21.559
you’re still wearing your wedding ring.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.020
CARL: Yeah, I’m a creature of habit.
I got used to wearin' it.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.897
Soon, I'll get used to not wearin' it.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.940
JOHN JR.: Colonel, you ever been
to the recruiting office

34:28.107 --> 34:31.110
where your wife works
and confronted her and Sergeant Bakewell?

34:31.194 --> 34:34.072
From the way you’re askin' the question,
I have to assume you know the answer.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.991
I did go there. I had what I thought
was a frank discussion

34:37.075 --> 34:39.452
with the both of them
about what they were doing, and I left.

34:39.535 --> 34:43.331
Now, you’ve also kept up a steady barrage
of phone calls and emails to your wife.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.958
I still have feelings
for the woman, Detective.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.711
Why was there a rifle
in the trunk of your car, Colonel?

34:48.878 --> 34:50.171
You went in my car?

34:50.254 --> 34:52.131
JOHN JR.:
We got a search warrant to go in your car.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.508
How did you get a search warrant?

34:53.591 --> 34:56.219
Your wife said you had a rifle,
and you behaved in a manner

34:56.302 --> 34:59.305
-that allowed us to get one.
-(CHUCKLES) Well, I guess it’s fair to say

34:59.388 --> 35:02.058
that loyalty’s not her
most prominent character trait.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.851
Must've hurt to realize that.

35:04.393 --> 35:05.561
It hurt like hell.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.314
I sucked it up and moved on.
Next question.

35:08.397 --> 35:10.233
What are you going to do
when ballistics comes back

35:10.358 --> 35:12.693
that it was your rifle used
to kill Sergeant Bakewell?

35:12.777 --> 35:14.946
I would suggest
you get another ballistics lab,

35:15.029 --> 35:16.697
because there’s no way in hell
that it’s true.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.199
I went through your 201 file, Colonel.

35:18.449 --> 35:21.828
You did three tours of duty
as commander of a combat arms unit.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.704
I spoke to someone
who served in that unit.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.540
He said you were hell of an officer.

35:25.706 --> 35:27.667
Looked out for your men,
put yourself at risk.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.002
I don’t think that the detective’s all
that interested in listening

35:30.169 --> 35:32.130
-to you blow smoke up my ass!
-But what I can’t understand

35:32.255 --> 35:34.382
is how you can lay in wait
and take out one of our own.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.384
Unless you thought
that was the only way to get her back.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.387
You think I want her
when she’s grieving another man?

35:39.470 --> 35:41.430
-I do not.
-In time, she’d forget him.

35:41.514 --> 35:44.350
I’m not waitin' my turn
on the receiving line for sloppy seconds,

35:44.433 --> 35:45.977
-thank you very much.
-What happened to you

35:46.060 --> 35:47.520
when you retired, Colonel?

35:48.020 --> 35:51.941
I mean, how do you go from a brave soldier
to a simpering coward

35:52.024 --> 35:53.818
who shoots an unarmed soldier,
and then lies about it?

35:53.943 --> 35:57.405
I don’t have to answer to you,
Junior Warrant Officer Nutting!

36:00.950 --> 36:01.951
Carl...

36:02.577 --> 36:04.078
I don’t have a military background,

36:04.162 --> 36:06.330
but based on what I know
about your record,

36:06.831 --> 36:11.002
it seems like your sense of honor
ought to cause you to tell us the truth.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.922
No matter what you did,
no matter why you did it.

36:17.717 --> 36:21.679
I thought we were gonna build
a world for ourselves, Angela and me.

36:22.597 --> 36:26.559
I came back from overseas
to have a house and a yard

36:26.851 --> 36:28.019
to raise children.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.980
That’s what I fought my way through hell
to get back to.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.231
Then I hung up my uniform,

36:32.315 --> 36:34.442
because it was time
to make a decent living.

36:34.734 --> 36:39.363
Time to stay in one place.
Time to enjoy our life together.

36:39.447 --> 36:43.951
I earned that right. I put in my time,
and I earned that right.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.078
And this guy took it away from you?

36:48.623 --> 36:49.624

36:50.374 --> 36:53.002
I set up on the location
where I knew he’d be.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.796
As soon as I had as clear shot...

36:56.756 --> 36:57.798
I took him out.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.844
What did he think was gonna happen?

37:04.347 --> 37:05.890
Boss, just wanted to let you know

37:05.973 --> 37:08.059
-the partner’s husband went for it.
-Where’s Nutting?

37:08.309 --> 37:09.936
Uh... He’s telling his commanding officer.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.479
That’s good work, Detective.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.898
-JOHN JR.: Thanks.
-Cleared this one without Sipowicz.

37:14.899 --> 37:15.900
Not really.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.367
Just wanted to let you know
someone else confessed.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.035
You can take your son home now.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.120
Is the guy from the army still here?

37:28.996 --> 37:30.873
-Yeah.
-My son would like to say something

37:30.957 --> 37:33.000
-to him.
-He was just doin' his job.

37:46.013 --> 37:48.766
(SIGHS) Are you gonna talk
to the family of the guy that got killed?

37:49.976 --> 37:51.644
Yeah, I'll probably put a call in to 'em.

37:53.145 --> 37:55.022
Will you tell 'em for me that I'm sorry?

37:56.649 --> 37:58.818
Especially if he has a younger brother.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.073
Yeah, I’ll let 'em know.
