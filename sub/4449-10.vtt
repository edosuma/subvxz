[sighs]

35:22.214 --> 35:26.284
[cheers and applause,
whistling]

35:26.385 --> 35:27.552
- WE'RE HEROES.

35:27.653 --> 35:29.421
- [chuckles] YEAH, I GUESS
IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK.

35:29.488 --> 35:32.024
I GUARANTEE MY NEW FRIEND
DOESN'T THINK SO, SID.

35:32.090 --> 35:33.625
YOU KNOW, IF SHE TALKS,
SHE'S DONE,

35:33.692 --> 35:35.560
BUT SHE IS GONNA ASK ME
WHY WE WENT IN UNDER THEIR NOSE

35:35.661 --> 35:37.696
AND EVERYONE DIED, AND
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL HER.

35:37.996 --> 35:40.198
- I KNOW WHAT YOU TELL HER.
YOU TELL HER NOTHING.

35:43.769 --> 35:46.004
GOOD JOB.
I'LL CALL YOU.

35:48.073 --> 35:50.275
- GUY MURDERED SEVEN PEOPLE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,

35:50.342 --> 35:51.677
RIGHT IN FRONT OF BRIGGS.

35:51.743 --> 35:56.148
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,
AND NOW MY ONE LEAD...

35:56.248 --> 35:58.350
IS LYING IN THE MORGUE.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.485
- I HATE IT AS MUCH AS YOU DO,

36:00.552 --> 36:02.621
BUT SULLA HASN'T BEEN HELPFUL
IN WEEKS,

36:02.688 --> 36:05.524
AND SID'S TEAM GOT
THE GIRLS OUT SAFELY, SO...

36:05.590 --> 36:07.592
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST, HUH?

36:07.693 --> 36:10.295
- NO, I'M SAYING
IT'S NOT A COMPLETE LOSS.

36:10.395 --> 36:12.597
- I DON'T KNOW WHY BRIGGS DIDN'T
GIVE ME A HEADS-UP, THOUGH.

36:12.698 --> 36:14.166
I MEAN, HE HAD TO KNOW
SID WAS PUTTING

36:14.266 --> 36:17.502
THIS WHOLE THING IN MOTION.
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK HIM.

36:17.569 --> 36:20.405
I TALKED TO THE GIRLS.

36:20.472 --> 36:22.441
I ASKED THEM ABOUT LINA.
- [sighs]

36:22.541 --> 36:24.009
YEAH?

36:24.076 --> 36:26.411
DID THEY HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE SHE MIGHT'VE WENT?

36:26.478 --> 36:28.447
- NOPE.

36:28.547 --> 36:31.383
THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HER ESCAPING.

36:31.450 --> 36:32.718
IT'S PRETTY WEIRD, RIGHT?

36:33.018 --> 36:34.519
- I DIDN'T TELL THE GIRLS
SHE ESCAPED.

36:37.055 --> 36:41.226
[door opens, closes]

36:41.326 --> 36:44.296
WELL, WELL, WELL...

36:44.396 --> 36:47.432
YOU'RE KIND OF
A SON OF A BITCH, HUH?

36:47.499 --> 36:50.202
- [sighs] THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD DO, MIKE.

36:50.302 --> 36:53.739
- RIGHT.
HOW'D SID FIND OUT ABOUT SULLA?

36:54.039 --> 36:55.507
- MAN, YOU GOT ME.

36:55.607 --> 36:57.476
BUT ONCE HE GOT THE TIP,
HE WASTED NO TIME

36:57.576 --> 36:59.211
PUTTING EVERYTHING INTO MOTION,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

36:59.277 --> 37:01.346
IT WAS BETTER TO SWING WITH
THE PENDULUM THAN RESIST IT.

37:01.446 --> 37:03.248
- COULDN'T FIND ANY WAY
TO WARN ME?

37:03.348 --> 37:05.650
- HOW? BY THE TIME I KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

37:05.751 --> 37:07.252
I WAS STANDING
RIGHT NEXT TO SID,

37:07.352 --> 37:09.087
LITERALLY, YOU KNOW,
POLE POSITION.

37:09.187 --> 37:12.290
- I MEAN, SEND ME A TEXT,
GIVE ME A CALL, CALL PAIGE.

37:12.357 --> 37:14.126
- NO, MIKE, I COULDN'T.

37:14.226 --> 37:15.761
I WAS BUSY
EARNING THE GUY'S TRUST.

37:15.994 --> 37:19.231
THAT'S WHAT YOU ASSIGNED ME
TO DO, REMEMBER?

37:19.331 --> 37:22.334
- SO YOU GUYS SCREWED ME, HUH?

37:22.400 --> 37:24.069
WE LOST EVERYTHING.

37:24.169 --> 37:25.570
- YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME,
BROTHER.

37:25.637 --> 37:27.606
SID IS FINALLY BRINGING ME
INTO THE FOLD.

37:27.672 --> 37:29.307
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED,
REMEMBER?

37:29.374 --> 37:30.776
WE GAINED EVERYTHING, MIKE.

37:31.076 --> 37:33.145
I MEAN, I MADE MYSELF AN MVP
TO THE GUY TODAY.

37:33.245 --> 37:36.081
DAMN NEAR CONFESSED
EVERYTHING TO ME.

37:36.148 --> 37:37.249
- YOU'RE IN.

37:37.349 --> 37:40.252
- I AM ALL THE WAY IN.

37:40.352 --> 37:41.686
- WELL, THE GUY MOWED DOWN
SEVEN PEOPLE

37:41.787 --> 37:44.055
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US,
AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING,

37:44.122 --> 37:45.323
SO HE'S GOT TO ACT AGAIN.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.292
- YEAH, HEY,
ONCE HE REALIZES

37:47.392 --> 37:49.027
HIS RETIREMENT PLAN
HAS DISAPPEARED

37:49.094 --> 37:51.296
FROM THOSE SAFE-DEPOSIT BOXES,
HE WILL,

37:51.363 --> 37:53.131
AND YOUR BOY'S GOING TO BE
STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM

37:53.231 --> 37:54.432
WHEN HE MAKES HIS MOVE, OKAY?

37:54.499 --> 37:57.135
- RIGHT.

37:58.370 --> 37:59.738
- JOHNNY.
- LOOK, BABE, I GOT TO GO.

38:00.005 --> 38:01.206
I GOT TO GO.
- LOOK, JOHNNY, STOP.

38:01.273 --> 38:03.575
LISTEN TO ME. I KNOW
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET MY FATHER.

38:03.642 --> 38:05.644
LISTEN, FOR YEARS,

38:05.710 --> 38:08.647
I FELT LIKE THIS
IS MY FAMILY, MY BLOOD.

38:08.713 --> 38:11.683
I HAD AN OBLIGATION
TO LOVE THEM.

38:11.750 --> 38:15.320
THEY HAVE NO LOVE,
NOT EVEN FOR THEMSELVES.

38:15.420 --> 38:17.455
- YOUR FATHER LOVES YOU.

38:17.556 --> 38:21.259
- MY FATHER WILL LOVE ME
UNTIL I THREATEN HIM,

38:21.326 --> 38:24.229
AND THEN IT WILL BE ME
WITH THE BROKEN FACE.

38:24.296 --> 38:26.998
LISTEN...

38:27.065 --> 38:28.533
YOU SAID, "ONE TIME."

38:28.633 --> 38:30.202
DID YOU MEAN IT?

38:30.268 --> 38:32.270
- YES, ONCE, AND THEN I'M OUT.

38:32.337 --> 38:33.538
- IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME,

38:33.605 --> 38:36.208
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A THIRD SOLANO TO WORRY ABOUT.

38:36.274 --> 38:38.677
- I'M NOT LYING TO YOU.

38:38.743 --> 38:39.778
- ALL RIGHT.

38:40.045 --> 38:41.379
AFTER THIS IS DONE,
WE TAKE THE MONEY,

38:41.446 --> 38:43.415
AND WE GET OUT OF HERE,
FOR GOOD.

38:43.481 --> 38:46.151
- OKAY.
YEAH.

38:46.218 --> 38:51.022
- GO SHOW MY FATHER YOUR PLANE
AND COME BACK TO ME.

38:51.122 --> 38:54.059
WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

39:12.177 --> 39:13.745
- SAME AMOUNT OF PRODUCT
AS BEFORE?

39:14.045 --> 39:15.046
- TO THE OUNCE.

39:15.146 --> 39:16.681
- BUT WE'VE ADDED
AN EXTRA FEATURE,

39:16.748 --> 39:19.184
SO JUST KEEP YOUR EYE ON IT.

39:44.209 --> 39:45.343
- IT'S CLEVER.

39:45.443 --> 39:47.612
- INFLATABLE RAFT
WITH A RIPCORD.

39:47.679 --> 39:49.614
WHEN THE CHUTE DEPLOYS,
THE RAFT INFLATES.

39:49.714 --> 39:52.384
- GO HOME, MAKE
THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS.

39:52.484 --> 39:54.219
IN ONE WEEK'S TIME,
WE BEGIN THE SHIPMENTS.

39:54.286 --> 39:55.487
- THANK YOU, SIR.
WE'LL BE READY.

39:55.553 --> 39:58.156
- SEÑOR SOLANO, I-I THINK
I SHOULD STAY IN MEXICO

39:58.223 --> 39:59.291
UNTIL WE'RE UP AND RUNNING.

39:59.357 --> 40:00.792
- YOUR BUSINESS IS NORTH NOW.

40:01.092 --> 40:02.427
- NO, DALE CAN HANDLE
THE DROP ZONE.

40:02.494 --> 40:03.662
I WANT TO STAY.

40:03.728 --> 40:06.531
- JOHNNY, I DON'T USUALLY GIVE
SECOND CHANCES.

40:06.598 --> 40:08.533
GO HOME.

40:12.604 --> 40:14.139
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

40:14.205 --> 40:15.707
YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH THE HOMELAND?

40:15.774 --> 40:18.510
[engine turning over]

40:18.610 --> 40:19.644
- I TOLD HER I'D BE BACK.

40:19.744 --> 40:21.246
- YOU TOLD LUCIA
YOU'D BE BACK?

40:21.313 --> 40:23.415
I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT YOURSELF--
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE!

40:23.515 --> 40:24.716
HEY--
- JOHNNY, IT IS THAT SIMPLE.

40:24.783 --> 40:26.518
YOU DO YOUR FRICKIN' JOB, MAN!
- I AM DOING MY JOB.

40:26.584 --> 40:28.720
YOU DO YOURS.

40:28.787 --> 40:31.289
DON'T--DON'T EVEN--
DON'T DO THAT.

40:31.389 --> 40:33.391
DON'T DO IT.
- DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

40:42.334 --> 40:45.236
- [sniffles]

40:49.207 --> 40:50.375
- SAUCE, HUH?

40:50.475 --> 40:52.510
- BEEN TOO LONG.

40:52.610 --> 40:56.047
- WAY TOO LONG.

40:56.114 --> 40:58.049
- YOU WANT TO HEAR THE STORY?

40:58.149 --> 41:01.086
- I KNOW THE STORY.
- [chuckles]

41:01.152 --> 41:03.521
JAKES CALLED.
HIM AND JOHNNY ARE COMING HOME.

41:03.588 --> 41:06.324
- OH. WHEN?
- NOW.

41:06.424 --> 41:09.427
MIKE AND PAIGE ARE DONE
AT SYLMAR, SO I JUST THOUGHT...

41:12.263 --> 41:17.002
YOU KNOW, GRACELAND USED TO BE
A SAFE HAVEN, YOU KNOW...

41:17.102 --> 41:19.404
FOR ALL OF US.

41:19.504 --> 41:21.406
I DON'T KNOW WHEN,
BUT WE LOST THAT.

41:21.506 --> 41:24.409
- WELL, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY.

41:24.476 --> 41:26.411
- YEAH.

41:29.781 --> 41:32.684
- CHARLIE, BABY, TURN AROUND.
LOOK AT ME.

41:39.124 --> 41:42.193
LISTEN, UM...

41:42.293 --> 41:44.429
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT IF IT--

41:44.529 --> 41:47.298
IF IT WAS GONNA BE ANYBODY,
IT WOULD BE YOU.

41:49.401 --> 41:51.169
I REALLY WANT TO KEEP IT.

41:51.269 --> 41:55.040
- [chuckles]

41:55.140 --> 41:58.043
[laughs]

42:02.313 --> 42:05.250
YOU WANT TO HELP ME
CUT THE PEPPERS?

42:05.316 --> 42:08.019
- YES, I DO.

42:14.559 --> 42:17.996
[cell phone ringing]

42:22.634 --> 42:25.103
- TEST, TEST.

42:25.203 --> 42:27.138
THIS IS AGENT JUAN BADILLO.

42:27.205 --> 42:29.474
I AM ABOUT TO APPROACH
AGENT PAUL BRIGGS

42:29.541 --> 42:32.077
REGARDING HIS ROLE
IN THE DEATHS OF FIVE AGENTS

42:32.143 --> 42:34.145
IN THE SAFE-HOUSE FIRE.

42:34.212 --> 42:37.315
I AM UNDERCOVER
AS THE CAZA MERCENARY

42:37.382 --> 42:39.317
KNOWN AS JANGLES.

43:07.512 --> 43:10.048
[dog barking]
