01:08.929 --> 01:10.248
Excuse me.

01:29.245 --> 01:29.967
Get out!

01:32.447 --> 01:34.167
Go! Get out!

01:38.406 --> 01:40.204
Where's Cora?
Did you see Cora?

01:40.404 --> 01:42.126
Did anybody see Cora?

01:48.005 --> 01:49.804
Cora?!

01:59.444 --> 02:00.844
What have we, George?

02:01.044 --> 02:02.684
The fire started around midnight, sir.

02:02.885 --> 02:03.684
And the cause?

02:03.882 --> 02:06.683
An incendiary device
was thrown through this window.

02:09.801 --> 02:11.403
Glass.

02:11.962 --> 02:13.883
Housed in a bottle, it would seem.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.801
Gather up all the shards.
See if we can raise fingermarks.

02:17.002 --> 02:18.242
Some may have survived the fire.

02:18.442 --> 02:19.482
What else?

02:19.681 --> 02:22.602
The madam couldn't find
one of her... employees.

02:22.801 --> 02:23.121
Mm-hmm.

02:23.321 --> 02:25.240
She went to look for her in her room.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.760
Where she found the victim.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.281
Exactly.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.241
Right, then.
Nothing's to be touched.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.238
I want a list of everyone
that was here tonight.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.400
The girls, their customers -- everyone.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.199
Oh, sir, that list could include
the mayor, a bishop.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.400
I mean, this was, after all,
the Music Academy.

02:40.599 --> 02:42.480
It could include
the chief constable himself.

02:42.679 --> 02:43.758
I want that list.

02:43.958 --> 02:44.958
Sir.

02:45.158 --> 02:46.919
The body's up this way.

02:49.278 --> 02:51.757
This is how the madam found her.

02:55.037 --> 02:56.797
Good Lord.

02:57.317 --> 02:59.397
It's a horrible wound.

03:00.157 --> 03:02.076
She appears to have been garroted.

03:02.276 --> 03:03.197
Do we know her name?

03:03.396 --> 03:06.557
Cora Devereaux, age 23.

03:12.594 --> 03:13.875
Letters from admirers.

03:14.435 --> 03:18.195
It appears Miss Devereaux
was a very popular woman.

03:18.395 --> 03:21.437
Perhaps it had something to do
with her taste in fine spirits.

03:21.636 --> 03:24.236
- Ab-sinthe. Ab-seenthe?
- Absinthe.

03:24.436 --> 03:27.557
It's a liquor popular in Europe
amongst the intelligentsia.

03:27.756 --> 03:29.275
Made with an herb -- Wormwood.

03:29.474 --> 03:31.274
Said to cause hallucinations.

03:31.474 --> 03:32.994
Hallucinations?

03:33.195 --> 03:34.914
How intriguing.

03:35.114 --> 03:37.194
- Anything else, George?
- No, sir.

03:37.394 --> 03:39.154
That's all the madam would tell me.

03:39.354 --> 03:40.592
Oh?

03:41.592 --> 03:43.193
Was she being uncooperative?

03:43.392 --> 03:44.873
Well, sir, she said
she wanted to give the rest

03:45.072 --> 03:46.512
of her statement to you personally.

03:46.712 --> 03:48.152
Really?
Where is she now?

03:48.351 --> 03:49.831
Right here, William.

03:54.670 --> 03:57.190
It's good to see you again.

03:57.391 --> 03:59.550
Always a pleasure, Miss Weston...

04:00.070 --> 04:02.230
...despite the circumstances.

04:08.189 --> 04:09.908
I've always looked after my girls.

04:10.109 --> 04:13.069
Arranged doctors,
kept their bellies full,

04:13.270 --> 04:15.749
advised on affairs of the heart.

04:18.188 --> 04:20.708
I didn't do a very good job with Cora,
I'm afraid.

04:20.908 --> 04:23.108
What can you tell me about her?

04:23.587 --> 04:25.266
Not much.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.188
She was in high demand
with my customers,

04:28.387 --> 04:30.187
even though she'd only been here
a short while.

04:30.388 --> 04:31.947
Oh?
How long?

04:32.147 --> 04:33.907
About six months.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.386
And where was she before that?

04:37.265 --> 04:39.787
- Montreal.
- What brought her here?

04:39.987 --> 04:42.186
I believe she had a spot of trouble.

04:42.746 --> 04:43.987
What kind of trouble?

04:44.187 --> 04:45.627
A violent customer.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.946
Had she any difficulties
with customers here?

04:50.147 --> 04:51.305
One.

04:51.865 --> 04:53.585
Arthur Webster.

04:53.785 --> 04:54.625
The painter?

04:54.825 --> 04:56.905
He'd become obsessed with her.

04:57.105 --> 04:59.784
In my experience,
that can only lead to trouble.

04:59.984 --> 05:01.506
I see.

05:02.745 --> 05:06.263
He refused to leave tonight,
so I had him removed.

05:06.463 --> 05:08.424
Tonight?
When was this?

05:08.624 --> 05:10.024
Around 10:00.

05:10.584 --> 05:13.503
Two hours before you discovered
Miss Devereaux's body.

05:13.703 --> 05:15.543
He could have returned, killed her,

05:15.743 --> 05:17.502
and set fire to the house
to cover his tracks.

05:17.702 --> 05:19.783
Except I keep the doors locked
at all times.

05:19.983 --> 05:23.660
Security is very important
for my girls and my clients.

05:24.941 --> 05:27.102
Perhaps he found a way to sneak in.

05:30.020 --> 05:32.501
Well, I suppose that's possible.

05:36.981 --> 05:39.179
Well, I think that's enough for now,
Miss Weston.

05:39.379 --> 05:40.378
Thank you.

05:40.579 --> 05:42.140
William.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.579
In all these years,
you haven't changed.

05:46.219 --> 05:47.899
Not a bit.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.578
And you, Ettie.

05:49.778 --> 05:52.698
You've done very well for yourself.

05:56.738 --> 05:58.537
Ah. Doctor.

05:58.738 --> 06:00.257
Detective.

06:00.457 --> 06:02.897
May I ask why
such a pretty dress for a murder?

06:03.098 --> 06:03.897
Oh.

06:04.096 --> 06:06.699
A gentleman asked me to dinner.

06:06.898 --> 06:07.738
Oh?

06:07.937 --> 06:10.536
Yes. A rather stuffy accountant,
as it turns out.

06:10.736 --> 06:12.378
He was busy explaining the difference

06:12.578 --> 06:14.178
between single-
and double-entry bookkeeping

06:14.378 --> 06:16.336
when I was called away.

06:16.537 --> 06:19.096
The garrote appears to have severed

06:19.296 --> 06:21.897
both the carotid artery
and the jugular vein.

06:22.096 --> 06:24.496
So the killer would have been
covered in blood?

06:24.696 --> 06:25.495
Not necessarily.

06:25.695 --> 06:27.215
The attack appears to have been
from behind,

06:27.415 --> 06:30.136
meaning he would have avoided
most of the blood spray.

06:32.335 --> 06:34.335
This is most interesting.

06:34.775 --> 06:35.655
What is it?

06:35.856 --> 06:37.734
There's another scar
winding around her neck...

06:38.813 --> 06:41.573
...suggesting a previous attempt
to garrote the victim.

06:42.054 --> 06:44.094
As though someone returned
to finish a job

06:44.293 --> 06:46.134
they had already started.

06:52.372 --> 06:54.012
Well, this is a right cock-up.

06:54.212 --> 06:55.612
What have you got there?

06:55.812 --> 06:57.692
What does this smell
remind you of, sir?

06:59.012 --> 07:00.012
Mineral spirits?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.773
More specifically, turpentine.

07:01.971 --> 07:03.770
Mm. Fuel used in the fire bomb, was it?

07:03.971 --> 07:05.730
One of them.
Likely the accelerant.

07:05.930 --> 07:07.171
To light something heavier.

07:07.369 --> 07:08.690
Kerosene more than likely.

07:08.890 --> 07:11.570
At least that's what
they taught us in the regiment.

07:11.770 --> 07:13.488
So the killer chucks it in
through the window,

07:13.689 --> 07:14.889
hoping to cover his tracks.

07:15.089 --> 07:16.329
But the bomb was poorly constructed.

07:16.529 --> 07:17.809
Caused more smoke than fire.

07:18.008 --> 07:19.289
Many lives were spared.

07:19.489 --> 07:20.888
Do we know which of the city fathers

07:21.089 --> 07:22.849
were caught with their strides down?

07:23.048 --> 07:24.168
- Strides?
- Trous--

07:24.367 --> 07:25.687
Uh, pants, pants.

07:25.888 --> 07:27.568
Yes.
I have a list.

07:29.088 --> 07:30.529
Mm.

07:30.729 --> 07:32.967
Bloody hell, Murdoch.

07:33.168 --> 07:34.928
Don't let this out of your sight.

07:35.128 --> 07:37.408
We're not gonna be able to keep
what happened out of the press,

07:37.609 --> 07:39.367
but at least we can try
and limit the damage.

07:39.566 --> 07:41.767
There's quite a few friends
of the department on here.

07:41.968 --> 07:43.807
Yes.
I'll try to ensure discretion.

07:44.007 --> 07:45.366
Do we have a suspect?

07:45.566 --> 07:49.326
Yes.
A painter with a jealous obsession.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.846
Miss Devereaux... dead?

07:53.886 --> 07:55.046
It can't be.

07:55.246 --> 07:57.805
I'm sorry to have to inform you,
Mr. Webster.

08:01.644 --> 08:02.644
Turpentine.

08:02.844 --> 08:04.166
To clean my brushes.

08:04.365 --> 08:05.846
What of it?

08:06.564 --> 08:09.165
We believe it was used to set the fire.

08:10.284 --> 08:12.204
But surely you don't think
that I had something to --

08:12.404 --> 08:14.644
Mr. Webster,
you had to be forcibly removed

08:14.844 --> 08:16.364
from the brothel last night.

08:16.964 --> 08:20.043
Sometimes I find it difficult
to leave Miss Devereaux.

08:20.802 --> 08:23.723
Surely you've felt the same way
towards a love.

08:24.843 --> 08:26.883
Where did you go afterwards?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.123
I came here to paint.

08:29.601 --> 08:31.281
I am...

08:31.481 --> 08:35.482
was always so inspired
after being with her.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.559
She was my muse.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.760
You were obsessed with her.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.759
So much so
that you couldn't stand the thought

08:42.958 --> 08:44.880
of other men being with her.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.958
I had already accepted that situation,

08:47.158 --> 08:48.998
as unfortunate as it was.

08:49.198 --> 08:50.559
Unfortunate?

08:51.320 --> 08:53.798
Yes.
Her heart belonged to another.

08:58.397 --> 09:00.759
I'm sorry to disturb you
at your home, Judge Wilson,

09:00.959 --> 09:03.159
but as I mentioned,
this is an urgent matter.

09:03.359 --> 09:04.358
I'm sorry I haven't much time.

09:04.557 --> 09:05.758
My caseload lately is very heavy.

09:05.957 --> 09:07.797
Yes.
I'll try to be brief.

09:07.997 --> 09:11.078
Are you familiar
with the Weston Music Academy?

09:11.277 --> 09:12.957
No, I am not.
Should I be?

09:13.157 --> 09:13.998
It's a brothel, sir.

09:14.198 --> 09:16.796
A young woman was murdered there
last night.

09:17.637 --> 09:18.556
I see.

09:18.757 --> 09:19.797
Most unfortunate.

09:19.998 --> 09:22.357
Sir, I believe you were a client
of the victim's.

09:22.556 --> 09:24.595
Are you suggesting that
I frequent brothels, Detective?

09:24.795 --> 09:27.595
With all due respect, sir,
you were mentioned by name.

09:29.476 --> 09:31.436
Well, many people would like to see me
removed from the bench.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.395
This is probably some ploy
to discredit me.

09:34.714 --> 09:36.114
Where were you last night?

09:36.315 --> 09:38.195
I was working late in chambers.

09:38.396 --> 09:39.475
And then I returned home.

09:39.674 --> 09:40.595
What time?

09:40.794 --> 09:42.074
About 10:00.

09:42.274 --> 09:44.553
I had a small glass of sherry,
and then I went to bed.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.195
And you remained here at home
the whole night?

09:47.394 --> 09:48.634
You're quite certain?

09:49.355 --> 09:51.793
I think I would know
if I'd gotten out of bed, don't you?

09:52.552 --> 09:56.353
Now, if there's nothing further,
Detective, I'm needed in court.

10:13.470 --> 10:14.351
Inspector.

10:14.550 --> 10:16.750
There's a gentleman
from the Temperance League to see you.

10:16.951 --> 10:18.349
A Mr. Beecher.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.071
Beecher? Bollocks.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.150
And there you go, sir.

10:21.350 --> 10:22.831
Send him in.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.871
- Go on in.
- Thank you.

10:27.070 --> 10:29.468
Inspector, the Temperance League
is no longer simply concerned

10:29.668 --> 10:30.789
with the evils of drink.

10:30.989 --> 10:33.670
All of society's woes
require our attention.

10:33.869 --> 10:35.709
So the missus has told me, Mr. Beecher.

10:35.908 --> 10:38.029
In particular,
it's the houses of ill fame

10:38.228 --> 10:40.587
and the plight of the women
in them that concern us.

10:40.787 --> 10:42.668
Same goes for the police.

10:42.868 --> 10:43.668
Well, so you say.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.347
And yet, Inspector, for some time,

10:45.547 --> 10:47.545
the entire constabulary,
yourself included,

10:47.745 --> 10:49.987
has tolerated the existence
of the Music Academy

10:50.187 --> 10:51.666
because it caters to the city's elite.

10:51.866 --> 10:54.306
You and I both know
that that place is first-class.

10:54.507 --> 10:55.747
Those lasses are well looked after.

10:55.947 --> 10:56.587
Are they?

10:57.425 --> 11:00.546
Perhaps Miss Devereaux's parents
would disagree.

11:01.146 --> 11:03.345
Inspector, on behalf of the thousands

11:03.545 --> 11:04.425
of Temperance League members,

11:04.625 --> 11:07.465
staunch supporters of our cause,
like your wife,

11:07.666 --> 11:09.743
I demand that place
be shut down immediately.

11:09.944 --> 11:12.146
You can tell your members
that the police are doing their job.

11:12.346 --> 11:15.143
In fact, we already have a suspect.

11:15.744 --> 11:16.943
- Oh?
- Yes.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.184
An artist.

11:18.384 --> 11:19.743
An artist.

11:19.944 --> 11:21.303
I see.

11:21.503 --> 11:25.183
Somewhat convenient, Inspector,
but a suspect nonetheless, huh?

11:25.384 --> 11:27.543
- What are you implying, sir?
- I'm not implying.

11:27.742 --> 11:30.184
I'm merely noting
that of all the powerful people

11:30.383 --> 11:33.862
in that brothel,
a lowly artist is the suspect.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.582
Facts do not lie, sir.

11:36.782 --> 11:38.460
Of course they don't.

11:39.302 --> 11:40.461
Inspector, the Temperance League

11:40.660 --> 11:42.662
will be watching
the progress of this case.

11:42.861 --> 11:46.421
If justice is not served,
you will be hearing from us.

11:48.822 --> 11:50.220
I can't wait.

11:53.821 --> 11:56.300
I would place time of death
roughly around midnight.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.622
Consistent with when the fire broke out.

11:58.822 --> 12:00.980
The stomach contents
revealed nothing out of the ordinary,

12:01.179 --> 12:02.940
except that she'd had an aperitif

12:03.139 --> 12:04.499
shortly before she was murdered.

12:04.699 --> 12:06.417
Anise-based, I believe.

12:07.538 --> 12:09.499
There was a bottle of absinthe
in the room.

12:09.698 --> 12:11.337
Oh?
The green fairy.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.177
Green fairy?

12:13.378 --> 12:15.377
Yes, the inspiration of many a poet.

12:15.577 --> 12:17.338
Some say she can be seen
after drinking it.

12:18.257 --> 12:19.777
Or overindulging in it.

12:19.977 --> 12:21.858
It's a most exotic drink.

12:22.057 --> 12:25.298
No doubt supplied
by your friend, the madam.

12:25.497 --> 12:26.576
How did you two meet?

12:26.776 --> 12:28.416
A church function, perhaps?

12:28.616 --> 12:30.456
Actually, we met during a case.

12:30.657 --> 12:33.856
Her friend Alice Black,
also a prostitute, was murdered.

12:34.056 --> 12:34.897
Oh.

12:36.016 --> 12:39.536
Fortunately, I managed to save Ettie --
Miss Weston's life.

12:39.735 --> 12:41.134
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to imply --

12:41.335 --> 12:44.455
I also misjudged Miss Weston
when I first met her.

12:45.534 --> 12:47.095
Were there any defensive wounds?

12:47.295 --> 12:49.014
There would have been
no time to struggle.

12:49.214 --> 12:50.853
Death would have been
almost instantaneous.

12:51.054 --> 12:52.932
There was this, however.

12:54.054 --> 12:54.854
Mm.

12:55.054 --> 12:56.851
Any idea how she got those scars?

12:57.053 --> 12:59.533
A whip or a lash, I should think.

13:00.533 --> 13:04.733
I've heard that those can be used
in sex play.

13:04.933 --> 13:07.692
Yes. These scars
are very nasty, though.

13:07.893 --> 13:10.132
I don't think there was
any play involved.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.653
No, I suppose not.

13:12.853 --> 13:14.892
Listen.
She was a doxy.

13:15.092 --> 13:17.892
She did things for money,
and some people pay for pain.

13:18.093 --> 13:20.210
Might explain how she got that older
scar on her neck as well.

13:20.410 --> 13:22.131
I highly doubt she would let someone
do that to her,

13:22.333 --> 13:23.132
no matter the price.

13:23.331 --> 13:25.529
She did allow herself
to be put in a vulnerable position,

13:25.730 --> 13:28.410
allowing men to put things
around her neck and so on.

13:29.051 --> 13:31.969
She wouldn't have noticed the garrote
until it was too late.

13:32.731 --> 13:34.849
Something happened to her
in Montreal.

13:35.409 --> 13:36.769
I have a mate on the force there.

13:36.969 --> 13:38.729
He might be able to tell us
a bit more.

13:38.930 --> 13:40.489
Sir, there's someone here
to see you.

13:45.888 --> 13:47.327
I'm Detective William Murdoch.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.488
Yes. I'm Paul Wilson,
His Honor's son.

13:49.687 --> 13:51.887
Ah, yes. Of course.
Mr. Wilson, how can I help you?

13:52.087 --> 13:53.926
Well, this is rather difficult,

13:54.126 --> 13:57.687
and I fear that it may implicate
my father in something unseemly.

13:57.886 --> 13:59.606
But if I'm not mistaken,

13:59.805 --> 14:02.126
Father told you he didn't go out
last night, did he not?

14:02.326 --> 14:03.606
That's correct.

14:04.326 --> 14:05.924
Well, I remember waking
in the middle of the night,

14:06.124 --> 14:07.806
and I heard
someone come into the house.

14:08.006 --> 14:10.046
There was a lot of commotion,
banging and whatnot.

14:10.246 --> 14:11.324
Did you investigate?

14:12.884 --> 14:14.645
This is very difficult for me.

14:14.845 --> 14:16.004
It was Father.

14:16.923 --> 14:17.924
You're certain?

14:18.483 --> 14:21.005
He's recently taken to coming in
at all hours of the night.

14:22.163 --> 14:23.483
Mm. I see.

14:23.682 --> 14:25.284
I'll be sure to look into this.

14:25.484 --> 14:26.924
Unfortunately, there's more.

14:27.123 --> 14:30.442
I...
I feel terrible about this.

14:30.922 --> 14:33.562
I found these
in the rear of his wardrobe.

14:42.641 --> 14:44.402
I'll ask you
one more time, Judge Wilson.

14:44.602 --> 14:47.562
How did you get the bloodstains
on your clothes?

14:47.762 --> 14:48.842
I couldn't tell you.

14:49.042 --> 14:50.322
You'll have to forgive me,
Your Honor,

14:50.521 --> 14:51.722
but you're not being forthcoming.

14:51.921 --> 14:53.320
I'm telling you what I know.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.762
You also told me
you never left your home.

14:55.962 --> 14:59.960
I just... don't know what happened.

15:00.681 --> 15:01.641
How can that be?

15:01.841 --> 15:03.800
Either you left your home
or you didn't.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.920
Such a damn muddle,
I can barely remember a thing.

15:08.119 --> 15:09.159
Let me help you.

15:09.359 --> 15:11.839
You went to the brothel.
You saw Miss Devereaux.

15:12.039 --> 15:12.840
Yes. Cora.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.039
What time was this?

15:14.239 --> 15:15.479
About 11:00.

15:15.678 --> 15:16.559
And then what?

15:16.758 --> 15:19.438
I...I must have dozed off.

15:19.638 --> 15:22.077
We'd been drinking,
and when I woke...

15:24.478 --> 15:26.037
...there was blood, and...

15:26.636 --> 15:28.117
...she was there beside me...

15:30.076 --> 15:31.116
...dead.

15:32.916 --> 15:35.196
And the next thing I know,
I was in front of my door at home.

15:35.395 --> 15:37.035
And you have no idea
how you got there?

15:37.236 --> 15:38.395
- No.
- Yet you had the good sense

15:38.595 --> 15:39.715
to remove the bloodstained clothing.

15:39.915 --> 15:41.995
Yes, I suppose so, yes.

15:42.596 --> 15:44.595
But I didn't kill her.
Of this, I am certain.

15:44.796 --> 15:46.114
How can you be?

15:46.314 --> 15:48.235
You don't seem certain
of anything else.

15:51.675 --> 15:53.595
Have you ever been in love?

15:53.794 --> 15:56.233
Deeply and profoundly in love?

15:56.433 --> 15:57.234
I have.

15:57.434 --> 15:58.713
Well, then you understand
when I tell you

15:58.913 --> 16:01.474
that, no matter
how confused I am,

16:01.674 --> 16:04.433
I-I wanted to spend the rest
of my life with Cora.

16:05.914 --> 16:07.593
Why else would I have asked her
to be my bride?

16:09.154 --> 16:10.553
He's gone completely daft.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.713
A judge just can't up
and marry some scarlet woman.

16:12.913 --> 16:13.833
He'd be throwing away his career.

16:14.033 --> 16:15.952
According to the judge,
they were very much in love.

16:16.151 --> 16:16.711
Love. Ha!

16:16.911 --> 16:18.112
The only thing she loved
was his money.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.033
And I think the judge
finally realized that as well.

16:20.232 --> 16:22.311
You think he discovered Miss Devereaux
was a gold digger.

16:22.511 --> 16:23.831
And in a blind rage, killed her.

16:25.031 --> 16:26.351
How could he have been
in her room

16:26.551 --> 16:28.111
and thrown the fire bomb
at the same time?

16:28.310 --> 16:29.471
That's a good point.

16:29.671 --> 16:30.511
And for that matter,

16:30.711 --> 16:33.029
why not just set fire to the bed
with her in it?

16:33.589 --> 16:35.390
Why not, indeed.

16:47.270 --> 16:49.748
The killer wasn't trying to cover up
his crime.

16:49.949 --> 16:52.108
He threw the fire bomb
to create a diversion.

16:52.829 --> 16:55.187
And in the confusion, slips in,

16:55.388 --> 16:57.588
goes upstairs, kills Miss Devereaux.

16:58.149 --> 17:00.068
Bloody diabolical.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.866
But then why is the judge still alive?

17:03.067 --> 17:05.828
Perhaps someone wanted us
to think that he was the killer.

17:06.468 --> 17:08.224
Then again,
maybe the judge had a partner,

17:08.425 --> 17:10.505
and this is all
just a wild theory.

17:10.704 --> 17:12.664
Seems we've got nothing but questions.

17:14.065 --> 17:15.585
Why am I here, William?

17:15.785 --> 17:17.665
You know very well why you're here.

17:17.865 --> 17:20.303
The judge was in Miss Devereaux's room,
wasn't he?

17:21.866 --> 17:23.025
I'm sorry.

17:23.224 --> 17:26.704
Tell me what happened.
And I want the truth this time.

17:27.905 --> 17:29.305
Very well.

17:29.505 --> 17:30.582
Cora?!

17:30.784 --> 17:33.584
I went to Cora's room, looking for her,
just as I told you.

17:34.265 --> 17:37.103
When I opened the door,
I saw him...

17:37.303 --> 17:38.903
holding her...

17:39.103 --> 17:40.544
...crying.

17:42.743 --> 17:43.903
The building was burning,

17:44.103 --> 17:46.103
so I helped him out,
and I had him taken home.

17:46.303 --> 17:48.141
Even though he murdered
one of your own girls?

17:48.342 --> 17:50.502
He did not murder Cora.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.702
How can you be certain?
You found him over the body.

17:52.902 --> 17:53.982
If you know anything about me, William,

17:54.182 --> 17:56.141
it's that I'm an expert on men.

17:56.340 --> 17:59.020
You won't deny that it's useful to have
a judge in your pocket.

17:59.940 --> 18:03.701
You trusted me in the past
when so many wouldn't.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.780
Trust me now.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.259
Very well.

18:10.461 --> 18:12.859
In the past, Miss Devereaux

18:13.060 --> 18:16.299
was involved with customers
who enjoyed the lash.

18:16.499 --> 18:18.099
Am I correct?

18:19.418 --> 18:20.581
Yes, in Montreal.

18:20.780 --> 18:22.499
And did she have any clients here

18:22.698 --> 18:24.498
with that certain proclivity?

18:24.699 --> 18:25.658
One.

18:25.858 --> 18:26.899
- The judge?
- No.

18:27.098 --> 18:28.377
Of course not.

18:28.937 --> 18:30.258
Then who?

18:33.137 --> 18:35.097
What's the meaning of this?

18:35.296 --> 18:37.217
I searched the rest of your house

18:37.417 --> 18:39.737
and found these in your bedside table.

18:39.937 --> 18:40.857
What was the nature

18:41.056 --> 18:42.696
of your relationship
with Miss Devereaux?

18:44.375 --> 18:49.016
Miss Devereaux... dominated,
disciplined me.

18:51.456 --> 18:53.695
You couldn't possibly understand.

18:53.895 --> 18:56.134
Oh, I think I understand you fully.

18:56.334 --> 18:57.856
You enjoyed being humiliated.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.015
Or at least
you thought you did...

19:00.215 --> 19:03.014
until Miss Devereaux
decided to marry the judge.

19:03.214 --> 19:06.093
That was too much humiliation
for even you to endure.

19:06.294 --> 19:07.814
My wanting to kill Miss Devereaux

19:08.015 --> 19:10.573
is as unlikely as the judge wanting to.

19:10.773 --> 19:11.973
You don't think he had reason?

19:12.172 --> 19:14.812
I had only respect for the way
he treated Miss Devereaux.

19:15.453 --> 19:18.292
Now, his son -- That is
a completely different story.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.373
His son?

19:19.573 --> 19:22.012
Miss Devereaux had ordered me
to accompany her

19:22.212 --> 19:24.011
to an opening at the art gallery.

19:24.211 --> 19:26.092
Young Mr. Wilson approached her,

19:26.292 --> 19:29.811
accused her of being
after his father's money, was insulting

19:30.011 --> 19:32.691
and so furious
I actually feared he would strike her.

19:32.890 --> 19:34.170
I was about to put him in his place,

19:34.372 --> 19:36.730
but Miss Devereaux
commanded me not to.

19:37.691 --> 19:39.171
I see.

19:53.368 --> 19:54.370
Mr. Wilson.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.809
That's quite a contraption.

19:56.009 --> 19:58.367
Yes!
Isn't it?

19:58.568 --> 20:00.888
An electric carriage.
One of the first in the city.

20:01.089 --> 20:02.247
Mm.
Do you own it?

20:02.448 --> 20:03.967
Well, I'm considering it.

20:04.887 --> 20:08.567
But frankly, it's difficult
to get excited about anything,

20:08.767 --> 20:10.727
given what's happened to Father.

20:10.927 --> 20:12.288
Unless you've come
with good news?

20:12.488 --> 20:14.009
There have been
recent developments.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.167
Wonderful.

20:15.367 --> 20:17.086
Assuming it's something
that will exonerate him.

20:17.288 --> 20:19.927
I understand you had
an extremely vitriolic exchange

20:20.127 --> 20:20.927
with the victim.

20:21.127 --> 20:22.287
It was a heated argument, true.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.807
But I was determined
to protect Father.

20:25.007 --> 20:27.206
Protect him?
From what?

20:27.406 --> 20:29.604
From that woman dragging
his good name through the mud.

20:29.804 --> 20:32.085
She would have ruined him,
professionally, socially.

20:32.284 --> 20:32.765
Financially?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.084
Well, that is what happens
when one falls victim

20:35.283 --> 20:38.203
to an avaricious manipulator
who's only after one's estate.

20:38.842 --> 20:40.684
It certainly is.

20:42.844 --> 20:44.963
Are you saying you suspect Paul?

20:46.282 --> 20:48.922
His behavior makes me curious.

20:49.121 --> 20:50.202
His behavior?

20:50.403 --> 20:53.603
He had a heated argument
with Miss Devereaux.

20:54.163 --> 20:57.401
Paul did not take well
to my decision to marry Cora.

20:57.601 --> 20:59.442
And why not?

21:00.082 --> 21:02.401
I've coddled Paul
since his mother died.

21:02.601 --> 21:04.281
He worshiped her.

21:04.479 --> 21:07.280
And it's likely he thought
he was defending her honor.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.281
Perhaps.

21:08.481 --> 21:11.520
Or perhaps he felt that his finances
were being threatened

21:11.720 --> 21:12.880
by your impending marriage.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.638
I don't see why he would feel that way.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.280
I had my attorney draw up a contract

21:17.480 --> 21:19.879
leaving him half of my estate
in the event of my death.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.238
What if half wasn't enough?

21:23.438 --> 21:25.557
Detective, my son's flaws are many.

21:25.758 --> 21:28.078
He's a talented pianist
who never plays.

21:28.279 --> 21:29.878
He requires constant validation

21:30.078 --> 21:32.358
from friends who don't care for him.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.238
He's never worked a day in his life.

21:36.318 --> 21:38.118
But he's still my son.

21:40.038 --> 21:40.878
I see.

21:41.997 --> 21:45.278
If I may, how were you planning
to deal with the...

21:45.478 --> 21:47.517
ramifications of your marriage?

21:48.157 --> 21:50.278
No need to be delicate, Detective.

21:50.877 --> 21:54.837
Cora's dream was to have a home
by the sea.

21:55.797 --> 22:00.276
I bought us a cottage
I found on the tip of Cape May.

22:01.636 --> 22:03.114
And we were going to leave
as soon as possible.

22:03.314 --> 22:06.235
Just... it wasn't soon enough.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.554
I loved Cora, deeply.

22:10.473 --> 22:12.874
I never let a day go by
without telling her.

22:13.873 --> 22:19.272
It's cold comfort,
but at least I didn't make that mistake.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.752
I've just received word back
from Montreal.

22:29.951 --> 22:30.751
What's that, then?

22:30.952 --> 22:32.471
It's a sample of the fire-bomb fuels

22:32.671 --> 22:34.471
collected from the carpet
in the brothel.

22:34.671 --> 22:35.871
I'm hoping that by identifying them,

22:36.071 --> 22:37.110
it might lead us to the killer.

22:37.310 --> 22:38.550
And how do you propose to do that?

22:39.110 --> 22:41.111
Specific gravity.

22:41.311 --> 22:43.590
Much like separating cream from milk.

22:43.790 --> 22:45.950
I'll have to send it
to the university, however.

22:46.150 --> 22:48.349
I would do it myself,
but I don't have a centrifuge.

22:48.550 --> 22:49.387
Oh, that's a shame.

22:49.588 --> 22:50.790
Anyway, back to Montreal.

22:50.990 --> 22:52.870
It seems there were two
rather nasty garrote attacks

22:53.071 --> 22:53.908
on prostitutes there.

22:54.109 --> 22:55.468
One of the victims survived.

22:55.668 --> 22:57.829
Went by the name
of Cora Devereaux.

22:58.308 --> 23:00.268
So we have a prostitute
running from a killer.

23:00.469 --> 23:01.588
Comes to Toronto to hide.

23:01.789 --> 23:03.869
But her past comes calling.

23:04.070 --> 23:05.628
Sir, might I interrupt?

23:05.828 --> 23:07.268
Yes, George.
Have you news on the case?

23:07.907 --> 23:09.149
You could say that.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.506
Sir, I believe
we have our murderer.

23:24.706 --> 23:26.306
You're leaping to conclusions, George.

23:26.507 --> 23:27.667
I don't think so, sir.

23:27.867 --> 23:30.066
He's left us a confession.

23:36.825 --> 23:39.066
Mr. Webster suffered cerebral edema.

23:39.267 --> 23:40.625
He was obviously cyanotic.

23:40.825 --> 23:43.865
And I found petechiae
on his skin and in his eyes.

23:44.065 --> 23:45.424
The cause of death was asphyxiation.

23:45.623 --> 23:48.623
So your findings are consistent
with a suicide?

23:48.824 --> 23:50.023
That troubles you?

23:50.224 --> 23:53.542
Something about this crime
just isn't sitting right with me.

23:53.742 --> 23:55.464
Well, I can run further tests
if you like.

23:55.663 --> 23:57.342
I would appreciate that.

23:59.901 --> 24:01.062
Was there something else?

24:02.380 --> 24:03.741
Yes.

24:03.941 --> 24:07.740
I was wondering if you would have dinner
with me tonight.

24:08.301 --> 24:09.301
Oh, certainly.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.581
I-I'm not sure that the results
will be back by then.

24:11.781 --> 24:14.261
Well, there are other matters
we could discuss.

24:14.460 --> 24:16.100
Current events.
Past events.

24:16.301 --> 24:18.779
Constable Crabtree's
remarkably untidy --

24:18.981 --> 24:21.619
Well, I... I'd be delighted.

24:23.298 --> 24:24.180
Good.

24:25.180 --> 24:26.660
Very good.

24:37.339 --> 24:39.458
Mr. Beecher, I thought
I should inform you personally

24:39.657 --> 24:41.058
before the newspapers publish.

24:41.258 --> 24:42.938
We've shut down
the Music Academy.

24:43.138 --> 24:44.258
The details are all there for you.

24:44.458 --> 24:45.938
Very good, Inspector.

24:46.138 --> 24:48.258
So this Mr. Webster hanged himself.

24:48.457 --> 24:49.416
That's right.

24:49.617 --> 24:52.057
And a confession written
in paint found by his side?

24:52.258 --> 24:53.457
Near the body, yes.

24:53.656 --> 24:55.016
What of Judge Wilson?

24:55.216 --> 24:57.697
He's still in custody,
but I'm sure he'll be exonerated.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.775
I should think there must be
some charge for him.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.336
Solicitation, perhaps?

25:01.537 --> 25:04.856
Yes. Well, there are unfortunate
vagaries in the laws.

25:06.655 --> 25:08.335
Of course there are.

25:08.936 --> 25:10.534
You must be quite pleased, Inspector.

25:10.734 --> 25:13.056
This worked out quite well for you.

25:13.735 --> 25:16.973
I'm not sure I appreciate
what you're insinuating, Mr. Beecher.

25:17.173 --> 25:18.534
Then let me be clear.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.934
The Temperance League
will change this city.

25:21.134 --> 25:21.974
Mark my words.

25:22.173 --> 25:25.255
Drink and loose morals
will be a thing of the past.

25:25.454 --> 25:28.252
Next time --
and there will be a next time --

25:28.451 --> 25:30.813
the rich and powerful
might not be so lucky.

25:31.372 --> 25:33.651
And perhaps neither will
the constabulary.

25:33.850 --> 25:35.372
Yes.
Well, thank you for stopping by.

25:35.572 --> 25:37.571
I'll see you out.

25:45.850 --> 25:47.250
Hello, Miss Weston.

25:47.451 --> 25:49.571
- Spare me your false sanctimony.
- Miss Weston --

25:49.772 --> 25:51.051
If I've offended you in any way --

25:51.250 --> 25:53.570
You come into my business,
proselytizing like some preacher

25:53.770 --> 25:55.929
about how you're acting
in the interests of women.

25:56.130 --> 25:58.290
Well, you turned every one of them
onto the street.

25:58.489 --> 26:00.090
They had protection
and medicine and clothing.

26:00.290 --> 26:01.569
And now they have nothing.

26:01.770 --> 26:03.409
Whatever happens to them
is on your head.

26:03.608 --> 26:05.330
Miss Weston,
perhaps I could get you a cup of tea

26:05.529 --> 26:07.329
in the detective's office?

26:08.248 --> 26:10.088
Thank you, Constable.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.526
The poor woman.

26:14.727 --> 26:17.008
I don't think we've been
formally introduced.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.926
Detective William Murdoch.
Who might you be?

26:19.127 --> 26:20.647
Levi Beecher.
It's a pleasure.

26:21.807 --> 26:22.928
Change is coming.

26:23.128 --> 26:24.646
Spread the good word.

26:29.966 --> 26:31.246
I'm sorry, William,
I caused a scene.

26:31.446 --> 26:33.406
But I cannot abide
that man's hypocrisy.

26:33.606 --> 26:34.927
It's quite all right, Ettie.

26:35.127 --> 26:38.246
I need you to tell me more
about the nature of the relationship

26:38.446 --> 26:40.566
between Miss Devereaux
and Arthur Webster.

26:40.765 --> 26:44.045
He referred to her exclusively
as Miss Devereaux, did he not?

26:44.246 --> 26:45.684
Always.

26:45.886 --> 26:48.085
Then why would he write,
"Forgive me, Cora,"

26:48.284 --> 26:49.404
at the scene of his death?

26:49.605 --> 26:51.443
I have no idea.

26:51.645 --> 26:54.005
So let me try to understand this.

26:54.204 --> 26:55.924
You don't think
Arthur Webster killed himself

26:56.123 --> 26:58.763
because he wrote "Cora"
instead of "Miss Devereaux"

26:58.962 --> 27:00.163
on his suicide note.

27:00.362 --> 27:02.644
Which apparently
is no longer a suicide note.

27:03.243 --> 27:04.283
That's my thinking, yes.

27:04.482 --> 27:06.442
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe he ran out of room?

27:06.641 --> 27:08.162
Miss Devereaux is quite
a long name to write.

27:08.362 --> 27:10.043
- Sir.
- Bloody hell, Murdoch.

27:10.242 --> 27:11.521
I thought we had this
all wrapped up.

27:11.721 --> 27:13.842
There is also no connection
to Montreal, sir.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.522
I'm gonna have
that bloody temperance bastard

27:15.722 --> 27:16.841
breathing down my neck again.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.880
So we're dealing
with a double murder, is that it?

27:25.440 --> 27:26.640
Not necessarily.

27:26.839 --> 27:28.240
The two cases may not be related.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.759
Not related?

27:29.960 --> 27:31.560
Our prime suspect was found hanging

27:31.759 --> 27:33.959
by a suicide note
bearing our victim's name.

27:34.159 --> 27:35.640
Sir, we have nothing
to connect the two cases.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.838
And until we do,

27:37.039 --> 27:39.599
it would behoove us
to treat them separately.

27:39.799 --> 27:41.879
So let's start with Miss Devereaux.

27:42.079 --> 27:45.559
If Webster didn't kill her,
then who the bloody hell did?

27:46.198 --> 27:48.799
Perhaps the man who stood
the most to gain from her death.

27:49.677 --> 27:51.598
The judge's son.

27:51.798 --> 27:54.077
Cora did stand in the way
of his inheritance.

27:54.277 --> 27:55.316
And he's the one who brought us

27:55.516 --> 27:57.677
the man's bloody clothing
to begin with.

28:00.956 --> 28:02.317
What are you thinking?

28:03.316 --> 28:05.676
Could I get you a spot of something
to take the edge off?

28:05.875 --> 28:07.436
A Pimm's and lemonade
would be nice.

28:07.636 --> 28:09.716
Yes. Well, I think you
might have to make do with tea.

28:09.916 --> 28:11.235
Higgins! Tea!

28:11.436 --> 28:13.474
We'd like to speak to you
about your father.

28:13.674 --> 28:15.634
Judge Wilson has always been
a very great friend

28:15.835 --> 28:16.756
to the Toronto police force.

28:16.956 --> 28:20.034
He's often spoken very highly
of the constabulary's fine work.

28:20.235 --> 28:23.195
Which is why we were so glad
to find another suspect.

28:24.753 --> 28:25.632
I see.

28:25.833 --> 28:28.274
And due to the overwhelming evidence
against this suspect,

28:28.475 --> 28:29.713
we may soon be able
to release your father.

28:29.912 --> 28:33.633
Why, that is terrific news.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.792
Now, this doesn't entirely
clear your father's name.

28:35.992 --> 28:37.353
Not yet.

28:37.553 --> 28:39.994
We still have to clear up
some minor details, such as,

28:40.193 --> 28:42.631
did the suspect have the ability
to build a fire bomb?

28:42.833 --> 28:43.834
Or the means.

28:44.033 --> 28:45.034
And we have to find the materials

28:45.233 --> 28:48.232
or some evidence of him
having had such materials.

28:48.432 --> 28:49.232
I see.

28:49.434 --> 28:51.032
But the point is this, Mr. Wilson.

28:51.232 --> 28:53.629
We think very soon your father's
good name will be cleared.

28:56.311 --> 28:59.070
I can't tell you
how relieved I am to hear this.

28:59.269 --> 29:01.710
Inspector, Detective,
the constabulary's diligence

29:01.910 --> 29:04.030
in this matter will not go unnoticed.

29:04.230 --> 29:05.310
We certainly hope not.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.508
I'll see you out.

29:13.630 --> 29:15.069
- George.
- Sir?

29:15.268 --> 29:16.268
The trap has been set.

29:16.468 --> 29:17.588
Sir.

29:22.227 --> 29:23.467
Just put it in the carriage.

29:23.668 --> 29:25.428
You know which one --
the one without the horses.

29:25.628 --> 29:27.187
Careful with that.

29:38.025 --> 29:40.186
That was delicious, William.

29:40.385 --> 29:43.146
Peanut butter and jelly.
Who would have thought?

29:43.345 --> 29:45.464
I thought the occasion
called for something special.

29:45.666 --> 29:48.026
I never took you for a gourmet.

29:49.144 --> 29:50.505
William?

29:50.705 --> 29:52.224
You seem preoccupied.
Is something wrong?

29:52.425 --> 29:55.303
Oh. Well, here we are,
you and I.

29:55.503 --> 29:56.344
Yes?

29:56.543 --> 29:58.143
And I must apologize.

29:58.342 --> 30:00.584
I can't help my thoughts
returning to the case.

30:01.984 --> 30:03.624
Perhaps we should
just discuss it, then.

30:03.823 --> 30:06.544
After all, I find it
as fascinating as you.

30:06.744 --> 30:07.663
Well, good.
Good.

30:07.864 --> 30:09.343
Um...

30:09.544 --> 30:11.024
All along I've suspected

30:11.223 --> 30:13.423
that the judge is incapable of murder.

30:13.624 --> 30:14.383
But?

30:14.583 --> 30:17.462
But there is another possibility.

30:17.662 --> 30:19.782
The two had been drinking absinthe.

30:19.983 --> 30:23.223
Perhaps the wormwood in it
caused him to become violent.

30:23.782 --> 30:25.981
Studies of wormwood's properties
say hallucination

30:26.181 --> 30:27.982
is a possible effect
of the thujone in it.

30:28.182 --> 30:29.822
Yet other studies state the opposite.

30:30.021 --> 30:32.900
Everyone's physiology
is as unique as their eyes.

30:33.102 --> 30:33.820
Exactly.

30:34.020 --> 30:35.819
So there really is no way
of knowing for certain

30:36.019 --> 30:37.459
how it would affect an individual.

30:38.780 --> 30:41.259
Doctor, how would you feel
about an experiment?

30:41.459 --> 30:42.819
An experiment?

30:43.020 --> 30:46.097
Yes.
I'd been saving it for later.

30:46.298 --> 30:52.297
But with all of this talk of absinthe,
I thought it apropos.

30:52.897 --> 30:54.737
William, I've never known you to drink.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.777
Only on special occasions.

30:56.978 --> 30:58.377
And this is one?

30:58.977 --> 31:00.177
Yes.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.576
Well, that would be delightful.

31:02.775 --> 31:04.658
And now it could serve
a double purpose.

31:04.857 --> 31:06.896
All in the name of science,
of course.

31:07.096 --> 31:08.936
Of course.

31:43.333 --> 31:44.732
Come on in.

32:18.488 --> 32:20.007
Well, I am disappointed.

32:20.209 --> 32:21.610
Hm?

32:21.809 --> 32:23.968
Not one green fairy.

32:24.488 --> 32:26.606
Disappointed?

32:26.809 --> 32:30.006
William, we can't have that.

32:53.925 --> 32:56.285
William, I think we should talk about
where this is heading.

32:56.486 --> 32:58.325
I'm very happy with where I am,
thank you.

32:58.525 --> 33:01.164
No, that wasn't what I meant.

33:01.365 --> 33:02.364
Oh?

33:02.564 --> 33:04.604
Y-Yes.

33:05.605 --> 33:07.443
Oh.

33:07.645 --> 33:09.964
Mrs. Kitchen doesn't usually
allow visitors.

33:10.164 --> 33:11.245
Oh.

33:11.444 --> 33:12.723
No.

33:12.922 --> 33:13.923
Oh.

33:14.123 --> 33:15.204
No.

33:15.404 --> 33:17.403
I was talking about precautions.

33:17.603 --> 33:18.723
Precautions?

33:18.923 --> 33:21.722
Yes.
I mean, do you have anything?

33:21.923 --> 33:23.642
Oh, you mean...

33:23.842 --> 33:26.203
Yes.
Prophylactics.

33:26.403 --> 33:29.121
Oh, I didn't think
I'd be needing any.

33:31.201 --> 33:32.601
Yes, we do, William.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.841
We -- We really, really do.

33:36.042 --> 33:38.280
How very modern of you.

33:39.201 --> 33:41.600
There will be other chances.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.720
But for tonight,
saner heads must prevail.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.761
For tonight.

34:03.558 --> 34:04.956
All right.

34:05.715 --> 34:07.957
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

34:14.795 --> 34:15.396
George.

34:16.556 --> 34:17.876
Oh, sir.
I'm sorry.

34:18.074 --> 34:19.117
- I must have nodded off...
- Shh, shh.

34:19.315 --> 34:20.395
...writing up my report.

34:20.597 --> 34:22.155
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine.

34:22.355 --> 34:24.317
I guess we both had
a long night.

34:24.516 --> 34:26.196
What did you find out
on your surveillance?

34:26.396 --> 34:28.914
Well, sir, it seems Paul Wilson
took the bait entirely.

34:29.114 --> 34:30.396
Here's the list of items
he purchased

34:30.596 --> 34:31.996
directly after your meeting.

34:32.795 --> 34:35.553
Well, I guess we just wait.

34:36.434 --> 34:39.675
And not for long, apparently.

34:44.553 --> 34:46.192
Mr. Wilson.

34:46.992 --> 34:48.994
Ah, Detective.

34:49.194 --> 34:50.674
I desperately hope this is nothing,

34:50.873 --> 34:52.072
but I knew my conscience wouldn't rest

34:52.272 --> 34:53.391
if I didn't bring it to your attention.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.193
- What is it?
- Well, I happened to be

34:55.393 --> 34:57.150
in the gardening shed this
morning to repair a shuttlecock,

34:57.351 --> 34:59.272
- and I found some items.
- I see.

34:59.473 --> 35:02.031
And would these items include kerosene,
turpentine,

35:02.230 --> 35:03.791
and some torn pieces of cloth?

35:04.711 --> 35:06.992
Why, yes.

35:08.431 --> 35:11.030
This is absurd.
I was trying to help you.

35:11.233 --> 35:13.389
Mr. Wilson, you've been trying
to frame your father

35:13.590 --> 35:14.990
ever since
you walked into this station

35:15.190 --> 35:16.189
with his bloody clothing.

35:16.390 --> 35:17.951
That is slanderous.

35:18.151 --> 35:20.190
You've been spending
your inheritance,

35:20.390 --> 35:21.310
throwing lavish parties

35:21.510 --> 35:23.269
as if you were never expecting him
to return.

35:23.470 --> 35:26.190
I needed to take my mind
off my father's incarceration.

35:26.389 --> 35:29.549
And now you volunteer evidence to us
you yourself acquired.

35:29.750 --> 35:30.988
I found those items.

35:31.189 --> 35:33.667
Mr. Wilson, I had you followed.

35:33.868 --> 35:34.949
My constables observed you

35:35.149 --> 35:37.387
purchasing these items yesterday.

35:37.948 --> 35:40.346
Now, not only are you guilty
of trying to frame your father,

35:40.547 --> 35:42.587
but you murdered Miss Devereaux as well.

35:42.787 --> 35:43.268
Murdered?

35:43.467 --> 35:44.627
You knew that if she lived,

35:44.828 --> 35:47.147
she would stand in the way
of your inheritance.

35:48.426 --> 35:49.907
Oh, God.

35:50.625 --> 35:51.946
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.

35:52.146 --> 35:53.866
No, I-I swear to you,
I didn't kill her.

35:54.065 --> 35:55.387
Enough, Mr. Wilson.

35:55.586 --> 35:57.185
Please tell me the truth.

35:59.305 --> 36:01.705
My father detests me.

36:02.585 --> 36:05.545
He belittles my artistic aspirations.

36:05.745 --> 36:08.224
He derides my taste in friends.

36:09.663 --> 36:13.585
I have suffered indignity
after indignity.

36:14.743 --> 36:18.544
So yes, I want my father's fortune.

36:18.743 --> 36:19.744
All of it.

36:21.023 --> 36:23.184
After all, it's rightly mine.

36:23.784 --> 36:25.302
You would watch your father hang

36:25.502 --> 36:28.182
so you could live out
your gadabout life?

36:28.862 --> 36:31.823
I-I didn't think
he'd actually hang for it.

36:32.022 --> 36:32.942
That's what happens

36:33.141 --> 36:35.182
when a man is convicted
of murder, Mr. Wilson.

36:36.021 --> 36:37.981
Luckily, it appears the noose
will be fitted

36:38.181 --> 36:39.542
to the proper neck.

36:40.381 --> 36:41.981
I didn't kill her.

36:42.781 --> 36:44.180
I didn't.
You have to believe me.

36:44.380 --> 36:45.381
I would never --

36:45.581 --> 36:47.660
I would never have the gumption
to actually kill anyone.

36:47.860 --> 36:49.460
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:51.980 --> 36:52.860
You're making a mistake.

36:53.060 --> 36:55.338
You're making a terrible mistake!

36:57.859 --> 36:59.780
Hello, Father.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.938
Hello, son.

37:02.138 --> 37:04.258
So the
little bugger framed his father,

37:04.459 --> 37:06.140
but you don't think
he killed Miss Devereaux?

37:06.340 --> 37:08.979
Why would he buy fire-bomb supplies
if he already had them?

37:09.179 --> 37:10.219
Good point.

37:10.419 --> 37:11.860
Besides, I fear he may be right.

37:12.059 --> 37:12.858
He doesn't have the gumption,

37:13.057 --> 37:14.658
let alone the competence, to kill.

37:14.859 --> 37:16.019
So we're back to where we were.

37:16.697 --> 37:17.817
Not quite.

37:18.017 --> 37:20.016
I conducted
a personal experiment last night

37:20.216 --> 37:21.417
with absinthe.

37:21.618 --> 37:23.136
You?

37:23.336 --> 37:24.534
Looking for little green fairies?

37:26.656 --> 37:27.975
You're having me on, Murdoch.

37:28.177 --> 37:29.855
I only wish, sir.

37:30.055 --> 37:32.737
However, the experiment
did prove to be quite beneficial.

37:32.936 --> 37:35.174
Oh.
Keep up the good work.

37:41.614 --> 37:42.614
Good morning, Julia.

37:44.054 --> 37:46.653
William.
How do you feel?

37:47.214 --> 37:48.933
My mind is elated,

37:49.133 --> 37:51.894
but my body seems to be
in a state of rebellion.

37:52.453 --> 37:54.252
Well, we did consume the better part

37:54.451 --> 37:56.294
of a bottle of absinthe last night.

37:56.493 --> 37:59.092
However, the experiment portion
of our evening

37:59.293 --> 38:00.611
was not a complete failure.

38:00.811 --> 38:01.972
How so?

38:02.172 --> 38:04.533
We drank far more absinthe
than the judge and Cora.

38:04.731 --> 38:09.531
In fact... here's the bottle
from her room.

38:10.171 --> 38:11.650
Far less indeed.

38:12.211 --> 38:14.372
Then why were they
so much more affected?

38:15.250 --> 38:16.810
Are you suggesting that something

38:17.010 --> 38:18.850
might have been added
to the absinthe they drank?

38:19.050 --> 38:21.570
It would explain why the victim
showed no signs of struggle.

38:21.769 --> 38:23.450
She was unconscious.

38:23.650 --> 38:26.130
And why the judge
was so disoriented.

38:27.809 --> 38:29.129
Could it have been laudanum?

38:29.809 --> 38:31.370
Possibly. Why?

38:31.570 --> 38:34.850
I just received Arthur Webster's
toxicology results.

38:35.049 --> 38:36.809
And there was laudanum
in his blood?

38:37.010 --> 38:39.768
So much so that I suspect
he was unconscious

38:39.969 --> 38:41.928
when he hanged himself.

38:42.489 --> 38:44.849
I'll run some tests
on the absinthe right away.

38:45.048 --> 38:47.127
And I'll find out
where the bottle came from.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.167
Oh. Um...

38:53.248 --> 38:54.767
Good morning.

38:56.887 --> 38:58.365
Morning.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.446
The bottle came
in a delivery package for Cora

39:05.645 --> 39:07.765
with her favorite flowers
and French perfume.

39:07.964 --> 39:11.245
It was sitting in a basket
on her night table when I came.

39:11.445 --> 39:12.764
She thought I'd sent it.

39:13.364 --> 39:15.244
Well, he was always lavishing her
with exotic gifts,

39:15.445 --> 39:16.964
so I just assumed
it was Judge Wilson.

39:17.164 --> 39:18.003
She was so happy with it,

39:18.203 --> 39:21.164
I didn't want to tell her
it wasn't from me.

39:21.364 --> 39:22.444
She loved absinthe.

39:22.643 --> 39:26.603
She said the wormwood would give us
the most delicious visions.

39:28.083 --> 39:30.162
But all it did
was put me to sleep.

39:31.363 --> 39:32.803
So whoever sent the absinthe

39:33.003 --> 39:34.560
knew that Cora had a taste for it.

39:34.761 --> 39:37.041
As well as for flowers and perfume.

39:37.242 --> 39:38.283
They must have had a history.

39:38.483 --> 39:40.161
Montreal again.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.241
Most likely.

39:41.440 --> 39:44.000
And now you believe this same person
killed Arthur Webster?

39:44.201 --> 39:44.640
Yes.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.240
We found a partial fingermark

39:46.440 --> 39:48.561
on a piece of glass from the fire bomb.

39:48.762 --> 39:52.359
Note the occluded swirl
just off-center.

39:52.559 --> 39:53.961
We found another fingermark

39:54.161 --> 39:55.720
on a glass at Arthur Webster's house.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.681
Not his.

39:56.881 --> 39:59.761
Note the same occluded swirl.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.519
So whoever threw the fire bomb
was at Arthur's house.

40:02.721 --> 40:02.999
Yes.

40:03.199 --> 40:05.760
And Dr. Ogden has confirmed
that Cora's absinthe bottle

40:05.960 --> 40:07.441
was laced with the same drug

40:07.640 --> 40:09.439
that was found
in Arthur Webster's body.

40:09.639 --> 40:11.919
So the same man was responsible
for both murders.

40:12.118 --> 40:12.919
What did I tell you?

40:13.119 --> 40:14.879
Yes, but we now have
the evidence to prove it.

40:15.079 --> 40:15.958
So who is he?

40:16.158 --> 40:18.039
- I have no idea.
- Bloody hell.

40:18.239 --> 40:19.159
Sir, we'll find him.

40:19.359 --> 40:21.757
We have a fingermark,
and we're still compiling evidence.

40:21.957 --> 40:23.038
Sir!

40:23.237 --> 40:24.799
You said you wanted this
as soon as it arrived.

40:24.998 --> 40:26.597
- It's from the university.
- What's that, then?

40:26.796 --> 40:28.958
It's the test results
on the carpet water.

40:29.158 --> 40:30.478
They found two combustibles.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.195
Kerosene and turpentine.

40:32.396 --> 40:34.798
Not turpentine.
Toluene.

40:34.998 --> 40:35.958
Toluene?

40:36.157 --> 40:37.876
- Never heard of it.
- Neither have I.

40:38.075 --> 40:39.515
Why does that not surprise me?

40:39.714 --> 40:42.154
You're not likely to
unless you work in industries

40:42.355 --> 40:45.354
that manufacture rubber,
do electroplating.

40:45.554 --> 40:46.355
And I don't.

40:46.555 --> 40:48.275
And neither do
any of our suspects.

40:48.833 --> 40:52.113
Apparently, it's also used
for lubricating printing presses.

40:53.113 --> 40:54.393
Printing presses.

40:56.393 --> 40:57.552
Change is coming.

40:58.073 --> 41:00.512
Spread the good word.

41:02.274 --> 41:04.553
I met her at a brothel
on Berger Street.

41:04.754 --> 41:05.952
She let me do things to her.

41:06.151 --> 41:09.151
Things even I didn't know
I was capable of.

41:09.351 --> 41:10.752
I kept going back until --

41:10.952 --> 41:12.990
Until you almost killed her.

41:13.191 --> 41:16.112
I didn't realize how ill I was.

41:16.990 --> 41:18.951
That's when I came here.

41:19.151 --> 41:21.952
But every city has its temptations.

41:22.513 --> 41:24.271
And I knew if I fell into my old ways,

41:24.471 --> 41:25.551
the illness would take hold.

41:25.750 --> 41:28.152
And how to avoid that?

41:28.350 --> 41:29.590
The Temperance League?

41:30.871 --> 41:32.950
Doing their good work
was my salvation.

41:33.512 --> 41:35.829
But then you saw
Miss Devereaux again.

41:36.029 --> 41:37.229
At the Music Academy.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.550
I was handing out pamphlets.

41:39.749 --> 41:41.350
She recognized me, of course.

41:41.549 --> 41:43.589
And I knew she would undo everything.

41:43.789 --> 41:46.348
So you chose to undo her instead.

41:46.868 --> 41:48.388
What choice did I have?

41:49.748 --> 41:52.948
Killing her was my only hope
of killing that thing inside of me.

41:53.149 --> 41:54.188
However, you had a problem.

41:54.389 --> 41:56.747
Miss Devereaux knew
that if she left the Music Academy,

41:56.947 --> 41:57.828
you'd be waiting.

41:58.028 --> 41:59.507
I had to get in.

41:59.708 --> 42:02.067
I studied the comings and goings
until I figured out how.

42:02.267 --> 42:03.988
That's when you sent
the absinthe bottle,

42:04.187 --> 42:05.426
knowing she was partial to it.

42:05.626 --> 42:06.947
It should have been simple.

42:07.147 --> 42:09.226
She should have
just been lying there.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.026
But he was with her.

42:12.385 --> 42:14.465
And Arthur Webster?

42:14.666 --> 42:16.825
I'd seen him come to the brothel
several times.

42:17.026 --> 42:19.904
When your inspector
said the suspect was an artist, well...

42:20.103 --> 42:23.063
I put two and two together
and paid him a visit.

42:23.623 --> 42:27.503
So you gave us a nice, tidy way
to wrap up our investigation.

42:29.023 --> 42:32.182
You know, Detective,
when I went to the Music Academy, I...

42:32.382 --> 42:34.342
I really just went to help those girls.

42:36.184 --> 42:37.701
Really.

42:43.703 --> 42:45.983
Why didn't Cora tell me
about Beecher?

42:46.183 --> 42:47.302
I'd have protected her.

42:47.502 --> 42:50.343
Or is that why
she finally said yes to me?

42:50.542 --> 42:53.021
Just to help her get away again.

42:53.221 --> 42:54.981
I have no doubt
that Cora's feelings for you

42:55.181 --> 42:56.182
were genuine, Your Honor.

42:56.382 --> 42:57.741
How could you know that?

42:57.940 --> 43:01.180
Because she could have
just run away.

43:01.381 --> 43:02.980
But she chose to be with you.

43:03.181 --> 43:06.220
You were the one
who was going to take her to safety.

43:07.901 --> 43:10.300
If only we left
when we had the chance.

43:11.459 --> 43:13.180
Why did I wait?

43:22.419 --> 43:24.417
Miss Weston.

43:26.418 --> 43:28.097
I've come to say goodbye, William.

43:28.297 --> 43:30.057
You're leaving?

43:32.818 --> 43:35.136
I was thinking of Winnipeg.

43:35.737 --> 43:36.737
Winnipeg?

43:38.656 --> 43:40.536
I have a little money saved.

43:40.736 --> 43:43.457
Perhaps I'll put my skills to use
and open a small café.

43:44.017 --> 43:46.295
And is this a café where coffee is sold,

43:46.494 --> 43:49.296
much like the piano lessons were
at your Music Academy?

43:49.496 --> 43:51.374
You could always come
to see for yourself,

43:51.575 --> 43:52.894
if ever you're in Winnipeg.

43:54.095 --> 43:56.093
But that's unlikely now, isn't it?

43:57.854 --> 43:59.374
It is now.

44:01.054 --> 44:02.853
Good luck, Ettie.

44:14.092 --> 44:16.171
Julia, I have something to tell you.

44:16.371 --> 44:17.653
Yes?

44:17.853 --> 44:19.893
Last night,
what happened between us --

44:20.092 --> 44:21.012
It should never have happened.

44:21.212 --> 44:22.731
Oh.
Well, I--

44:22.930 --> 44:23.371
Oh.

44:23.571 --> 44:25.411
Uh, what I mean to say

44:25.611 --> 44:28.652
is that I shouldn't have waited so long

44:28.851 --> 44:31.451
to share my feelings towards you.

44:32.890 --> 44:35.969
Well, William, you should know
that you're not the only one

44:36.171 --> 44:37.730
that lives inside their head.

44:37.930 --> 44:39.249
No?

44:39.450 --> 44:40.930
No.

44:41.890 --> 44:44.049
Well, perhaps another picnic
is in order, then?

44:44.249 --> 44:46.490
Well, that would be splendid.

44:46.690 --> 44:49.849
Without a visit
from the green fairy this time.

44:50.049 --> 44:51.748
I think that would be wise.
