WEBVTT

01:41.351 --> 01:43.436
ls there more? l love her.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.606
l saw Susan Watson do it on Broadway,
and she was great,

01:46.690 --> 01:49.692
-but she didn't have that.
-Well, it's not going to be her,

01:49.777 --> 01:52.445
but they want that scene
"frame for frame," as they say.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.740
So, something about how desperate she is
for a Pepsi?

01:55.824 --> 02:00.036
lt's for Pepsi, but it's not for Pepsi.
lt's called Patio,

02:00.120 --> 02:03.581
and it's a dieter's kind of Pepsi
to help women reduce.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.958
lt's Pepsi's diet-right cola,

02:06.043 --> 02:10.129
and there's claims that their lawyers
went over calories, etcetera.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.381
lf we do it right, we land Patio.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.426
And if we land Patio,
l'll be at lunch with Pepsi.

02:15.511 --> 02:19.555
-l think Pete Campbell just broke a sweat.
-l'm coming to casting.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.559
-We're going right to casting?
-You don't have to if you don't want to.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.354
l understand why you like this,
but it's not for you.

02:26.438 --> 02:30.191
-l'm the one who'd be buying Patio.
-You're not fat anymore.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.901
Thank you.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.904
Let's assume we can't talk them out
of the name,

02:34.988 --> 02:37.615
and let's assume we can get a girl
who can match Ann-Margret's ability

02:37.699 --> 02:40.993
-to be 25 and act 14.
-ls that what she's doing?

02:42.830 --> 02:46.165
ls it just a knockoff?
Are we allowed to make fun of it, at least?

02:46.250 --> 02:50.837
-She's fun and sexy. Don't be a prude.
-Would you say that to me?

02:51.964 --> 02:56.592
-lt's sexy, and it's what they want.
-Clients don't always know what's best.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.888
When we land them,
you can start talking to them that way.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.184
Pick it up.
Bobby, back away from the stove.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.400
We're out of Melba Toast.

03:12.568 --> 03:16.195
Jesus, Betts, have some oatmeal.
That baby's gonna weigh a pound.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.408
Carla must have had some,
because l would have thrown the box away.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.786
Are we gonna collect the whole set?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.705
l thought you didn't mind her
doing the legwork.

03:25.789 --> 03:30.001
You didn't need a decorator last time.
l'd like to feel like l'm paying for something.

03:30.085 --> 03:34.422
-These are $3 apiece, you know.
-And l can't really judge by a picture.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.799
l'm late.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.845
We should really spend a day in Tarrytown.
lt'd be so easy.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.306
-No.
-Those stores smell bad.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.516
We are going to Tarrytown.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.520
And you're gonna stare
at some antique chair for so long

03:49.605 --> 03:53.774
the buttons are gonna seem interesting,
and then we'll go to Carvel.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.653
See you tonight.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.197
What are you doing?

04:01.116 --> 04:03.743
l hope you received the package
showing our campaign

04:03.827 --> 04:06.996
to ease the way
for the Ravenswood nuclear power facility.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.873
Kinsey was responsible for that.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.584
Almost a year,
and nary a peep of opposition.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.252
lt was very impressive.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.923
l've told Paul that you're facing
an onslaught of negative public opinion

04:17.007 --> 04:21.135
in your attempt to demolish
the Pennsylvania Railroad Station this year

04:21.219 --> 04:23.471
and replace it
with the new Madison Square Garden.

04:23.555 --> 04:26.349
We should have torn the damn thing down
during the newspaper strike.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.434
No one would have noticed.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.854
Now, let's take a look at the landscape,
as it were.

04:50.582 --> 04:54.293
"How to kill a city.
Architects' inhumanity to architects

04:54.378 --> 04:58.464
"surpasses understanding.
The new design is also ambitious,

04:58.548 --> 05:00.549
"pedestrian and dull."

05:00.634 --> 05:03.761
Ada Louise Huxtable
is as green as that folder.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.472
People know that she's an angry woman
with a big mouth.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.099
Who writes for The New York Times.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.226
l don't care if she wrote
for the Ten Commandments.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.480
She's trying to sell papers doing what
they always do. Making people miserable.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.900
My great-great-grandfather, Silus Dikeman,
would have turned his boat around

05:17.985 --> 05:22.238
if he had known that this city
would one day be filled with crybabies.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.908
So what's your best weapon
against lunatics?

05:25.993 --> 05:30.329
Fifteen stories, vaulted ceilings,
pink Milford granite columns.

05:30.414 --> 05:34.208
l don't think it's crazy to be attached
to a beaux-arts masterpiece

05:34.292 --> 05:36.460
through which Teddy Roosevelt
came and went.

05:36.545 --> 05:39.296
l've met the opposition. l know crazy.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.759
Do you know where
the greatest Roman ruins are?

05:43.969 --> 05:48.347
They're in Greece, Spain,
because the Romans tore theirs all down.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.600
They took apart the Colosseum
to build their outhouses.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.562
This is the Colosseum.
Have you seen the plans?

05:54.646 --> 05:56.522
In The New York Times.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.776
-Do you have a problem, buddy?
-He's looking for an angle.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.530
You know those snide ad men
you see in the movies?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.741
Right here.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.995
Well, l've got a mailbox full of death threats
from beatniks like him

06:11.079 --> 06:12.580
who'd rather live in a teepee.

06:12.664 --> 06:16.834
This is the greatest city in the world.
lf you don't like it, leave.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.215
Well, we'll let you know.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.888
You have no problems
with an atom plant on the East River,

06:28.972 --> 06:34.018
-but this bothers you?
-lt's Penn Station. This city has no memory.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.562
Out with the old, in with the new.
Who says that's a good idea?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.607
l'm going to have to talk to Don about this.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.818
Don't do that.

06:44.529 --> 06:48.824
Look, now they'll trust me more
when l help them.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.286
Do you ever listen to yourself?

06:53.163 --> 06:56.248
l hate you, you know that.
Other than Wilma Flintstone,

06:56.333 --> 06:58.292
l haven't seen anyone carry so well.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.670
lt's smoke and mirrors.
l've busted plenty of seams.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.298
Well, it makes me optimistic.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.051
Greg has made it perfectly clear
that come July 1

07:07.135 --> 07:09.595
and he's chief resident,
l'd better watch out.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.182
-Hello, Mrs. Draper.
-Can you get Mrs. Draper a glass of water?

07:13.266 --> 07:16.018
Why don't you tell me first
how long l'm going to be here?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.356
What's so urgent?
London Bridge falling down?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.399
ln a manner of speaking.

07:23.568 --> 07:27.655
-l appreciate you stopping by.
-Didn't you just call us into your office?

07:27.739 --> 07:31.075
Well, yes.
l thought it best if l told you in person.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.451
l just heard from London.

07:32.536 --> 07:35.079
We've been sacked
by Campbell Soup, Great Britain.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.624
l don't want to have to walk down here
every time we lose an account.

07:38.708 --> 07:42.586
This is an advertising agency.
l'll wear out the carpet.

07:47.717 --> 07:52.721
lt's not so much the account we lost
as the account we failed to gain.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.976
-So now BBDO has all of Campbell's Soup?
-Why didn't we have a meeting with them?

07:57.060 --> 08:00.646
Perhaps l should drag Burt Peterson in
and fire him again?

08:00.730 --> 08:05.359
-Obviously Don would've loved a shot.
-How did this slip through the cracks?

08:05.694 --> 08:07.611
l don't usually set meetings, l attend them.

08:07.696 --> 08:11.824
Well, if this is where we wanted to end up,
we all did everything perfectly.

08:11.908 --> 08:15.661
You ever get three sheets to the wind
and try that thing on?

08:16.454 --> 08:18.205
Mrs. Pryce is here.

08:18.790 --> 08:23.043
Nothing to fret about, as long
as there's new business. Five minutes?

08:30.677 --> 08:34.221
-lt's definitely side to side.
-ls that a boy or a girl?

08:34.973 --> 08:36.765
l'll call my mother.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.644
Look. Princess Grace
just swallowed a basketball.

08:41.605 --> 08:45.274
-How are you, Roger?
-lt's not hard to adjust to happiness.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.609
Shall we?

09:03.126 --> 09:05.127
Good night, Mrs. Harris.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.715
l'm in a foul mood.

09:13.011 --> 09:17.306
ChÃ¢teau Lafite Rothschild, '49.
l'm very impressed that you have this.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.516
Not bad at that.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.398
-Where are you living?
-We have a furnished flat in Sutton Place.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.193
Three bedrooms,
spectacular view of the river.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.655
And we're near the UN,
so there's plenty ofAfricans.

09:36.701 --> 09:40.287
Like the Bordeaux grape,
may we all get better with time.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.168
This is delicious.

09:47.545 --> 09:51.006
Rebecca was curious
if you knew anything about schools.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.926
ln the city, l'm a little out of touch.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.762
How long have you been together?

09:56.846 --> 09:58.722
-Ten years.
-Nine years.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.017
Fifteen for us.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.690
-Do you miss London?
-God, yes.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.777
But what we lost in London
we gained in insects.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.201
J. Walter Thompson
is opening an office in Caracas.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.704
l don't know if the ladies
want to talk about that.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.539
No, of course not.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.210
The coquilles. Brilliant.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.800
Look, l didn't want to be there
any more than you did.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.761
lt was just the cherry on top of my sundae.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.142
What?

10:44.561 --> 10:48.105
Tell me now,
and not three seconds after l've dozed off.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.068
l've been trying to get my father
on the phone.

10:56.531 --> 11:00.075
Of course l called William and, again,
something's wrong.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.828
Another stroke?

11:03.747 --> 11:06.665
-Gloria left him.
-Can you blame her?

11:07.250 --> 11:10.836
Yes, l can blame her. She came into his life,

11:11.171 --> 11:14.006
he suddenly takes ill
and she abandons him.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.093
Maybe she realized he's a son of a bitch.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.097
Don, l'm worried about him.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.518
He doesn't sound right,
and l can't take a car trip now.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.233
l think William and Judy
should bring him up this weekend.

11:33.318 --> 11:38.113
-Great, more antiques.
-lt's spring break. lt'll be nice for the kids.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.868
-Those girls are a nightmare.
-They'll leave by Saturday at the latest.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.292
Why did you even bother asking me?

11:53.088 --> 11:54.880
She's really kicking.

12:03.932 --> 12:07.434
-Mr. Sterling, your family is here.
-Send them in.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.815
lf it isn't fall bride.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.487
-Where's Brooks?
-He'll be along.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.990
-Would anyone like anything? Coffee or...
-lt's 1 0:30.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.662
Sherry, if you have it.

12:28.123 --> 12:31.750
l told Brooks to come late.
l don't want him to be embarrassed.

12:31.835 --> 12:37.798
By what? That l'm paying for everything?
You just tell him that's the way it's done.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.926
No, Roger, it's about Jane.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.596
What about her?
lt was her idea to take you to Dior.

12:45.348 --> 12:49.309
Why haven't you returned her calls?
You're hurting her feelings.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.813
l know what you think.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.816
You think it's so uncomfortable
that l won't even bring it up.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.569
Well, you're being very dramatic
for a girl who didn't want a wedding at all.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.946
Do you want me to say it?
Do l have to say it?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.448
Say what, exactly?

13:02.532 --> 13:06.869
l've suggested to Margaret a compromise.
You and June host your own table,

13:06.953 --> 13:11.540
-and l'll be at the Hargroves'.
-So, you get the in-laws and l get Siberia?

13:13.293 --> 13:16.378
Are you worried about an odd number?
Because l'll get your mother a date.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.213
-l have a date.
-Who?

13:18.840 --> 13:21.633
-Bruce Pike.
-What does that old saddlebag want?

13:21.718 --> 13:24.720
l didn't want to go to her wedding,
but l did.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.265
-The least she can do is not come to mine.
-Not come?

13:28.349 --> 13:32.227
-That's why l suggested a compromise.
-You're not even giving Jane a chance.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.314
Seeing her on my wedding day
is gonna ruin it.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.859
She's young enough to be my sister.
How does it look?

13:39.110 --> 13:41.612
-Sweetheart.
-Brooks! Thank God.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.238
Mom.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.952
-How are you, sir?
-Not great, Brooks. Not great.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.830
Can l get you something?

13:51.915 --> 13:54.374
-No.
-That's okay. l'll have yours.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.461
-Roger.
-We're not married anymore, you know.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.797
l like the silver and the bells.

14:05.011 --> 14:09.932
Go with the bells. November 23rd.
l'll tell Jane.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.357
Mr. Pryce is here to see you.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.862
Send him in.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.615
Your wife is charming.

14:28.451 --> 14:33.705
-She lifted Rebecca's spirits inestimably.
-l'm glad to hear it. They really hit it off.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.670
l hate to send you into the lion's den,
but l think it best you take the gentleman

14:39.754 --> 14:42.714
from Madison Square Garden
to a nice lunch today.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.884
Peter and Paul rubbed him
very much the wrong way.

14:45.969 --> 14:49.888
-l told you before, Roger's the lion tamer.
-Roger will join as well.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.057
lt will help if you tell me
who these people are.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.851
All l could secure was Edgar Raffit,

14:54.936 --> 14:58.480
vice president of Madison Square Garden,
and he's irate.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.983
What does he want?

15:01.067 --> 15:04.820
A Cyrano de Bergerac
to make New York fall in love with him.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.490
-Today?
-Do you have plans?

15:12.036 --> 15:14.538
Have Campbell send over the folder.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.507
They're wild lndians.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.385
They've been cooped up since Woodbridge.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.345
l fixed some lunch.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.393
-Cold roast chicken, or l have cold cuts.
-We went to Pat's Steaks.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.104
l got you a half.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.608
-Have you all already eaten?
-No, we waited.

15:45.236 --> 15:50.157
-l even got Gloria a chicken parmesan.
-Well, great. We'll mail it to her.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.203
She's in Boca Raton.
She's not coming back.

15:59.042 --> 16:02.294
He understands completely.
He's just playing it up.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.548
-How was the drive, Daddy?
-ln the Lincoln?

16:08.885 --> 16:12.054
You should take your Coumadin
with your sandwich.

16:19.062 --> 16:23.649
So l said to them, "lt's so crowded in here,
l feel like l'm on the subway."

16:24.025 --> 16:26.193
l've never seen anyone like you on the train.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.237
Well, my husband won't let me.
lt's a figure of speech.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.949
Have a seat,
and l'll let Mr. Pryce know that you're here.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.926
Sorry about that. l got tied up.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.137
What else do you have to do today?
What else do you have to do all week?

16:54.222 --> 16:56.098
l barely made it here.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.184
Ginger presses the buzzer,
says, "Your family's here."

16:59.268 --> 17:03.271
Sounded silly. Gibson, up.
That's gonna help.

17:04.982 --> 17:08.193
To my knees, Don.
They're bringing me to my knees.

17:09.070 --> 17:12.948
-Sorry to hear that.
-l made my bed, l should lie in it, right?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.284
Your words, not mine.

17:19.789 --> 17:23.542
Like it's not hard enough
losing my little girl to that kid.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.170
l've got her mother
pouring poison in her ear.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.464
There's a land grab going on.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.472
l blame Mona.

17:38.850 --> 17:42.060
All of a sudden,
l could give two craps about that wedding.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.646
-All l want to do is win.
-Gentlemen.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.902
-A pleasure to meet you. Roger Sterling.
-Edgar Raffit.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.655
-Our creative director Don Draper.
-Edgar.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.658
Have a seat, please. Let's get you fixed up.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.412
l only have a minute.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.749
Edgar, please.
Eat our sweetmeats, drink our wine.

18:07.754 --> 18:12.174
l understand one of our copywriters
took a Yetta Wallenda-sized misstep.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.887
The girl, the tightrope walker.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.098
They got her off the sidewalk
with a hose last week.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.435
The point is,
we completely understand your problem.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.731
-All we want to know is how we can help.
-You're supposed to tell me.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.817
Well, l've done all l can. Don?

18:33.237 --> 18:35.781
ln the interest of time,
you want to demolish Penn Station

18:35.865 --> 18:39.743
-and New York hates it.
-Not all of New York. A vocal minority.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.286
Can they stop it?

18:41.370 --> 18:44.331
Well, l think all the hubbub
is making it unpleasant for...

18:44.415 --> 18:46.833
But they can't stop it, can they?

18:48.085 --> 18:51.379
Why do you people insist
on making us sound like villains?

18:51.464 --> 18:55.175
Your concern over public opinion
shows a guilty conscience.

18:55.551 --> 19:00.138
Now what good is that serving you
if what is to be done is already underway?

19:00.223 --> 19:01.598
Leave those.

19:02.225 --> 19:06.019
Bring a couple of iceberg wedges,
blue cheese, bacon.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.857
So let's say
l don't have a guilty conscience.

19:10.942 --> 19:16.321
Good. And let's also say that change
is neither good or bad, it simply is.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.157
lt can be greeted with terror orjoy.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.452
A tantrum that says,
"l want it the way it was,"

19:23.079 --> 19:26.248
or a dance that says,
"Look. lt's something new."

19:27.792 --> 19:31.753
-Would you draw the line at 50%?
-l'm not drawing a line at all.

19:31.921 --> 19:35.173
PR people understand this,
but they can never execute it.

19:35.258 --> 19:39.845
lf you don't like what is being said,
change the conversation.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.648
What is that conversation?

19:54.443 --> 19:58.738
l was in California.
Everything is new, and it's clean.

19:58.948 --> 20:03.785
The people are filled with hope.
New York City is in decay.

20:06.622 --> 20:11.126
But Madison Square Garden...
lt's the beginning of a new city on a hill.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.297
-Just like that?
-lt's true, isn't it?

20:17.133 --> 20:20.969
lf l were to come to you,
l don't want that kid on my account.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.515
-The communist, the radical.
-l will handle it personally.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.938
Grandpa Gene is going
to watch his program now.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.026
l just want to catch the end of the game.

20:37.528 --> 20:41.865
-Move.
-And the first pitch of the ball, outside.

20:53.794 --> 20:57.672
-Daddy seems well. He has an appetite.
-He eats constantly.

20:58.341 --> 21:02.010
When l found out Gloria was gone,
l was hoping he ate her.

21:02.386 --> 21:06.264
-How could you not know about that?
-l went by, but he lied to me.

21:06.349 --> 21:09.225
Then, finally, when l let myself in,
he went bananas.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.769
He's ashamed.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.063
Judy can get through to him.

21:13.147 --> 21:16.775
He's down in the dumps,
but he seems very clearheaded.

21:16.859 --> 21:21.279
That's not true, Judy, and you know it.
He's angry, and he's in and out.

21:24.575 --> 21:30.789
There is this place, the Parker Home.
lt's midway between us, in New Brunswick.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.209
And what happens there?

21:34.543 --> 21:37.837
He lives there.
lt's got everything, plus doctors.

21:38.631 --> 21:42.384
lt's expensive, but l thought
maybe we could sell our house.

21:43.219 --> 21:46.012
You know.
That would give him enough to live on.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.889
That's very generous.

21:51.060 --> 21:55.188
-Do you think he belongs in a home?
-Betty, l know l don't get a vote.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.566
-Neither does Don.
-All you care about is the house.

21:59.276 --> 22:02.195
You want to walk in there,
see Daddy on the bottom of the stairs,

22:02.279 --> 22:05.240
and have his last words be,
"Take the house."

22:11.414 --> 22:14.249
Fine, Betts. What's the solution?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.377
Those homes are for people
who don't have families, William.

22:17.461 --> 22:21.840
-He's a lonely old man and he's not well.
-He's your father.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.908
-Gene.
-Thanks for the ritzy accommodations.

22:49.744 --> 22:54.456
You're an army man, Gene.
Drop your socks and grab something.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.890
Lights out at 8:1 5. l'm impressed.

23:11.974 --> 23:16.269
l wish you would hang your coat up
downstairs. lt's covered with soot.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.738
-How bad is he?
-He's not the problem.

23:27.823 --> 23:32.827
What am l saying? He's the whole problem.
That, and William's never-ending bullshit.

23:33.871 --> 23:37.165
-What now?
-He wants to put him in an old folks' home.

23:37.249 --> 23:41.377
Well, l understand it's not ideal,
but it is the next logical step.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.713
Don, he just wants the house.

23:44.340 --> 23:48.843
He keeps nailing himself to the cross.
For all l know, Judy's pushing him.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.431
Cut it out!

23:59.814 --> 24:01.689
What do you want to do?

24:03.025 --> 24:06.528
How can he talk that way to me
in the condition l'm in?

24:07.863 --> 24:11.866
-Do you want anything?
-Just throw it on the chair and stay here.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.584
Be careful.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.420
l'm fine.

24:39.061 --> 24:43.773
lt's so funny how she is.
My father and her fought constantly.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.943
She never remembers that part.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.738
-Family is important to her.
-l care about family.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.577
You know, Don had nobody
at their wedding. Nobody at all.

24:59.665 --> 25:03.293
Why can't we just move in with him?
l'll take care of him.

25:03.419 --> 25:06.921
lt's bad enough to work for him.
l'm a 30-year-old man.

25:08.048 --> 25:11.885
l don't want to have somebody tell me
l have the wrong tie on.

26:26.293 --> 26:29.921
Raffit is sending over every piece of paper
they have on the new Garden.

26:30.005 --> 26:33.967
He wants you to see these new drawings.
Apparently they're right out of Metropolis.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.719
-He talk about television?
-l have a meeting on the books.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.514
He talked a lot about radio. And Kinsey.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.349
You're gonna have
to keep a low profile on this,

26:41.433 --> 26:45.770
-but it doesn't mean you're not working.
-Mr. Pryce is here to see you.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.733
l didn't realize
you were in the middle of something.

26:50.818 --> 26:53.778
Did you come to treat us
to a little new-business lunch?

26:53.862 --> 26:56.489
May l speak with you in private, Don?

27:02.997 --> 27:05.707
-Can l get you anything?
-No, thank you.

27:07.418 --> 27:11.129
Bad news, l'm afraid.
l just got off the phone with London.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.215
There's a problem
with Madison Square Garden.

27:14.466 --> 27:18.219
-Did their check bounce already?
-Unfortunately, there's a conflict.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.431
Did you tell them it's a stadium
in the middle of New York City?

27:21.515 --> 27:24.475
-lt's one of a kind.
-They know exactly what it is, a project,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.978
and they told us to turn it down.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.441
-l'm confused.
-lt's a question of economics.

27:31.525 --> 27:35.236
Servicing Madison Square Garden
will require an account man,

27:36.238 --> 27:37.947
at least two copywriters, two artists,

27:38.032 --> 27:41.743
an ombudsman for City Hall,
all against 200,000 in billings.

27:41.910 --> 27:42.910
That's for right now.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.497
Precisely. From what l understand,
groundbreaking is at least two years away.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.667
Madison Square Garden
is our way into the World's Fair,

27:49.752 --> 27:51.961
the largest trade show in history.

27:52.046 --> 27:56.257
Plus, there's the Garden itself.
Hotels, concerts, sports.

27:56.800 --> 28:01.637
-This could mean 30 years of business.
-They're not interested. l'm sorry.

28:04.391 --> 28:08.186
You told me to go out and get this account.
l did. l did my job,

28:08.270 --> 28:09.520
and now you're telling me
it's all for nothing

28:09.605 --> 28:13.191
because you forgot to check with
your boss first? Who's running this place?

28:13.275 --> 28:16.986
l know this is difficult.
l take full responsibility.

28:17.154 --> 28:20.239
Why the hell did you buy us
in the first place?

28:22.242 --> 28:23.701
l don't know.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.966
Tell Mr. Campbell
Madison Square Garden is dead.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.803
-Do you have a second?
-Can it wait?

28:41.887 --> 28:42.929
No.

28:48.102 --> 28:50.228
Sal sent up the storyboards.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.066
-What is this?
-lt's Patio, the diet drink for Pepsi.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.528
Yes. Everyone wants a drink
that sounds like a floor.

28:59.655 --> 29:00.780
This is Chinese.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.741
lt's all one shot,
like the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.

29:03.826 --> 29:07.286
-l haven't seen it.
-Well, this is an Ann-Margret type.

29:08.038 --> 29:09.163
Fine.

29:09.957 --> 29:12.166
You really haven't seen it?
You see everything.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.732
We have a few versions of a song,

29:36.984 --> 29:39.861
and the boys are very excited
about finding this girl.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.195
l'm sure.

29:41.989 --> 29:44.323
Don't you find her voice shrill?

29:45.742 --> 29:49.203
She's throwing herself at the camera.
lt's pure.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.540
lt makes your heart hurt.

29:52.624 --> 29:57.545
No one seems to care that it speaks to men,
not the people that drink diet drinks.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.257
What do the geniuses at Patio want?

30:02.593 --> 30:06.846
Maybe we should be talking about how
this is better than coffee or Dexedrine.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.307
lt's not about making women feel fat.

30:09.391 --> 30:13.144
This is, "Look how happy l am
that l drink Patio.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.607
"l'm young and excited
and desperate for a man."

30:18.108 --> 30:21.694
l don't mind fantasies,
but shouldn't it be a female one?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.571
Peggy, l know you understand
how this works.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.990
Men want her. Women want to be her.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.326
-Even if that's true...
-lt is.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.622
l'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.875
Well, you know,
if we were making a movie or a play,

30:35.959 --> 30:38.878
we'd be embarrassed to do this. lt's phony.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.758
You're not an artist, Peggy.
You solve problems.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.263
Leave some tools in your toolbox.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.438
Could you hold that?

31:09.243 --> 31:10.952
-Heading home?
-Yes.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.334
Let me ask you something.
You're a young girl.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.752
Excuse me?

31:20.295 --> 31:24.674
You're the only one around here who
doesn't have that stupid look on her face.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.509
What does that mean?

31:26.718 --> 31:31.222
What would your father have to do
for you to not want him at your wedding?

31:32.057 --> 31:36.811
-My father passed away.
-There you go. You'd do anything.

32:19.813 --> 32:20.980
Hello.

32:36.955 --> 32:40.416
lt's so crowded in here,
l feel like l'm on the subway.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.046
Where's your drink?

32:59.728 --> 33:03.856
Don. Don't worry about this.
lt's under control.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.954
-Hey, where's Mom?
-She's upstairs.

33:32.427 --> 33:36.138
-l'm going out for a bucket of chicken.
-What's the matter?

33:36.640 --> 33:39.433
-l'm a horrible daughter.
-No, you're not.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.688
William says these are the options.
We put him in a home,

33:43.772 --> 33:47.858
or they move in with him
and Judy is his nurse. Judy.

33:48.402 --> 33:49.860
William says?

33:51.196 --> 33:52.947
He's probably right.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.658
-William!
-Yeah, Don?

33:57.285 --> 33:59.578
Go get the chicken in a minute.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.583
Can l speak to you a minute?

34:14.386 --> 34:19.473
-Jesus. What year is this from?
-l don't care.

34:21.351 --> 34:25.646
Look, Don, we're all upset.

34:26.648 --> 34:29.734
One thing l've learned from this,
don't get old.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.154
-About your father...
-Man's a real jackpot.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.158
He always said he didn't want
to be a burden, yet here we are.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.537
This is what's going to happen.

34:42.164 --> 34:44.582
You're gonna explain to your sister
and your wife

34:44.666 --> 34:47.293
that we have reached an understanding.

34:48.086 --> 34:51.088
You are going to support
your father financially,

34:51.173 --> 34:56.635
and l am going to take him into my house.
His house will remain untouched.

34:57.179 --> 35:01.098
l appreciate the advice, Don.
l'll take it under consideration.

35:01.183 --> 35:03.225
You're gonna go out there
and you're gonna tell your sister

35:03.310 --> 35:05.394
that this is what you want.

35:05.562 --> 35:08.189
We'll pretend that you did the right thing
on your own.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.858
-He's my father!
-And he's in my home.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.029
l want you to leave tonight,
and l want you to leave the Lincoln.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.741
-l can't have him here without a car.
-Are you kidding me?

35:20.660 --> 35:22.995
How are we supposed to get home?

35:24.539 --> 35:27.875
New York Central.
Broadway Limited from Penn Station.

35:29.002 --> 35:30.878
lt leaves in two hours.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.466
You want him? You got him.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.897
-Dad, we have to talk.
-l could eat.

36:32.607 --> 36:36.026
No. Daddy, William has something to say.

36:39.489 --> 36:43.158
All of us, we've been trying to figure out
a way we can help you live better.

36:43.243 --> 36:46.328
l'd be doing all right if people left me alone.

36:46.830 --> 36:47.997
Daddy,

36:48.790 --> 36:52.793
-Don and l want you to live here with us.
-Elizabeth.

36:54.421 --> 36:56.130
Honey, l'm not that blue.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.675
Just for a while.
l think you need a little vacation.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.016
So the animals are running the zoo?

37:07.100 --> 37:10.811
We're not selling the house,
and you're gonna have your car.

37:12.314 --> 37:15.524
The plans, the plans, the plans you make.

37:21.448 --> 37:25.284
You know you want to get out of town.
You'll be with the kids.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.705
Betty is a better cook. You always say that.

37:35.086 --> 37:40.424
-Well, l should've been the first to go.
-Daddy, don't talk like that.

37:43.887 --> 37:47.765
We should go pack.
Girls, start getting your things together.

37:57.567 --> 38:00.361
lt's nice, right? lt's called a stinger.

38:01.321 --> 38:04.198
-l don't know what's in it.
-lt's delicious.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.957
l'm graduating from Brooklyn College
next month.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.250
-What are you studying?
-What?

38:15.543 --> 38:18.671
-What are you studying?
-Do you want one?

38:19.881 --> 38:23.092
-l'm afraid you're gonna bite my hand.
-l'm sorry.

38:24.719 --> 38:28.931

My mom says l'm still growing.

38:32.102 --> 38:34.228
l gotta work on my manners.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.941
l started pre-law,
but switched to engineering. More jobs.

38:39.359 --> 38:42.111
Really? Those are so different.

38:42.946 --> 38:45.364
You've gotta figure,
if we're all gonna be replaced by machines,

38:45.448 --> 38:47.491
might as well be a guy
that makes them, right?

38:47.575 --> 38:49.994
Or you could just become a robot.

38:51.329 --> 38:55.332
-Are you in school?
-l work at an ad agency, Manhattan.

38:56.209 --> 38:59.461
Wow. l don't know how you girls
do all that typing.

39:02.257 --> 39:06.301
-And l work for a jerk.
-We're hitting the road. You got cab fare?

39:07.303 --> 39:09.847
What are you talking about?
l live around the corner.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.807
That's right. He does.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.072
You're funny.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.640

39:55.977 --> 39:57.895

-A Trojan?

40:02.859 --> 40:03.942

40:17.957 --> 40:22.669

40:32.347 --> 40:36.225
Jeez. lt's getting pretty late.

40:39.229 --> 40:40.354
Well,

40:42.065 --> 40:44.566

41:13.888 --> 41:15.556
Did you hear that?

41:26.693 --> 41:27.776
Gene.

41:29.154 --> 41:32.239
The heat is on.
We got to get rid of this stuff.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.497
You got anything else around, go flush it.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.837
-You're leaving?
-l have to work tomorrow.

42:29.923 --> 42:33.550
-You want to get breakfast?
-lt's the middle of the night.

42:35.345 --> 42:38.138
-Where do you work again?
-Madison Avenue.

42:38.848 --> 42:40.015
Right.

42:41.976 --> 42:45.479
Well, you know,
l hang out at that place a lot.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.485
Okay.

43:02.538 --> 43:04.331
lt's the bottom one.

43:06.709 --> 43:07.918
Thanks.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.214
This was fun.

43:19.764 --> 43:24.559
Parents, friends, and family,
l'd like to welcome you all to field day.

43:25.812 --> 43:29.606
l hope you can appreciate
how hard the children have prepared

43:29.941 --> 43:31.900
in all kinds of weather.

43:33.569 --> 43:34.736
Scott?

43:38.283 --> 43:42.202
"The tradition of the maypole
dates back over 500 years,

43:42.620 --> 43:45.247
"and is celebrated all over the world.

43:45.456 --> 43:51.461
"We erected our maypole
for Ossining's sesquicentennial.

43:52.338 --> 43:55.799
"We dance around the pole
in a timeless celebration

43:56.217 --> 43:58.552
"of the renewal of springtime."

44:06.311 --> 44:07.936
Okay, ribbons up.

45:20.009 --> 45:24.262
-Daddy! Did you see me dance?
-l did. You were great.

45:27.266 --> 45:28.934
Hey. Hey, Drapers.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.272
Cindy's dad wants to take our picture.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.650
Say, "Cheese!"

45:36.734 --> 45:38.318
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

45:56.671 --> 45:59.381
