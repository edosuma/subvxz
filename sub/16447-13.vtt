(baby crying)
BERNADETTE: Please stop crying.

00:05.848 --> 00:08.949
I'm begging you.
I don't know what else to do.

00:08.950 --> 00:10.616
My boobs are empty.

00:10.618 --> 00:12.385
Do you want lasagna?

00:12.387 --> 00:15.021
(baby fussing)

00:16.891 --> 00:19.058
It's okay, it's okay.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.493
Shh...

00:20.495 --> 00:21.961
(crying stops)

00:26.801 --> 00:29.969
What have we done?

00:31.205 --> 00:32.305
(door opens)

00:32.307 --> 00:34.674
(soft music playing)

00:34.676 --> 00:36.742
What... what's all this?

00:36.744 --> 00:39.178
Well, it sounded like
you were having a rough day,

00:39.180 --> 00:41.547
so I wanted you to come home
to something nice.

00:41.549 --> 00:44.116
Oh, that is so thoughtful.

00:44.118 --> 00:45.685
Hey, do you remember when
we went wine tasting

00:45.687 --> 00:46.953
in Santa Barbara
and you said

00:46.955 --> 00:48.521
that was the best
rosé you'd ever had?

00:48.523 --> 00:50.957
Yeah, I remember
us driving up there,

00:50.959 --> 00:53.793
going to the winery and...

00:53.795 --> 00:55.761
that's it.

00:55.763 --> 00:57.163
And this wine is why.

00:57.165 --> 00:59.265
Oh.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.000
Hey, what smells so good?

01:01.002 --> 01:03.736
I made your favorite:
pizza bagels!

01:03.738 --> 01:04.837
(gasps)

01:04.839 --> 01:07.540
Pink wine and pizza bagels?

01:07.542 --> 01:10.176
It's like eighth grade
all over again.

01:10.178 --> 01:13.379
I am so lucky to have you.

01:13.381 --> 01:14.580
Well, now be careful,
these are hot.

01:14.582 --> 01:16.182
I-I could explain
the thermodynamics

01:16.184 --> 01:18.451
of why the cheese seems
hotter than the crust,

01:18.453 --> 01:20.252
but instead, I'm gonna
keep it to myself.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.287
Oh.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.223
You always know what not to say.

01:24.225 --> 01:26.926
I just, I can't believe
you did all this.

01:26.928 --> 01:28.227
Well, you know,

01:28.229 --> 01:31.063
it's easy to take each
other for granted and

01:31.065 --> 01:33.733
I never want to do
that to you, because

01:33.735 --> 01:36.302
your love,

01:36.304 --> 01:38.437
it's like a river.

01:38.439 --> 01:41.207
It's peaceful and deep.

01:41.209 --> 01:43.643
Your soul is,
it's like a secret

01:43.645 --> 01:46.712
that I never could keep.

01:46.714 --> 01:49.982
You did not just
quote an NSYNC song.

01:51.452 --> 01:53.719
I quoted your favorite
NSYNC song.

01:54.822 --> 01:56.522
Oh...
(chuckles)

01:57.692 --> 01:58.758
Mm.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.059
(belches)

02:05.099 --> 02:06.966
(chuckling):
Damn.

02:06.968 --> 02:09.268
I burped so hard,
I died in my game.

02:36.062 --> 02:38.429
Leonard, I've been
meaning to ask you:

02:38.430 --> 02:40.497
what size shoe
do you wear?

02:40.499 --> 02:41.632
Why?

02:41.634 --> 02:43.100
I'm trying to take
more of an interest

02:43.102 --> 02:45.035
in other
people's lives.

02:47.373 --> 02:48.205
That's nice.

02:48.207 --> 02:49.573
I wear a size
eight and a half.

02:49.575 --> 02:51.909
(giggles)
That's small.

02:52.945 --> 02:57.047
So, tell me, do you have
any plans for the weekend?

02:57.049 --> 02:58.682
Are you gonna laugh
at the answer?

02:58.684 --> 03:02.552
Only if the answer is
"shopping for baby shoes."

03:04.323 --> 03:05.455
If you must know,

03:05.457 --> 03:07.291
Penny won a spa weekend
from work

03:07.293 --> 03:08.692
and she's taking me.

03:08.694 --> 03:10.627
Oh, well you know,
that is interesting.

03:10.629 --> 03:13.530
I wonder what kind of infection
you'll come home with.

03:15.367 --> 03:17.601
My money's on fungal.

03:17.603 --> 03:22.139
They're still having girl''
night across the hall.

03:22.141 --> 03:24.675
Oh, so, hang out with me
and we'll have boys' night.

03:24.677 --> 03:26.677
At our age,

03:26.679 --> 03:28.712
why don't we call it
man's night?

03:28.714 --> 03:32.516
Because we just spent our
allowance on comic books.

03:35.220 --> 03:38.655
Penny, is it weird that
we're having girls' night here,

03:38.657 --> 03:39.957
but you don't
live here anymore,

03:39.959 --> 03:41.458
so it's basically
my girls' night?

03:41.460 --> 03:42.993
I hadn't really
thought about it.

03:42.995 --> 03:44.928
But now you're thinking about it
and it bothers you?

03:44.930 --> 03:46.697
I get that.

03:48.634 --> 03:51.635
Things going well with you
and Sheldon living together?

03:51.637 --> 03:52.903
Better than ever.

03:52.905 --> 03:55.739
He asks about my day,
takes an interest in my life.

03:55.741 --> 03:57.341
He's like my boyfriend
in college,

03:57.343 --> 04:00.243
except he's real,
so people can see him.

04:02.247 --> 04:03.714
I've been seeing him for years,

04:03.716 --> 04:05.983
I'm still not convinced
he's real.

04:07.353 --> 04:09.353
Hey, can I
ask you a question?

04:09.355 --> 04:10.821
You've been married
for a while.

04:10.823 --> 04:12.255
Is it normal
for the husband

04:12.257 --> 04:15.559
to kind of completely stop
giving a crap?

04:15.561 --> 04:18.095
(sighs)
Uh-oh, what's going on?

04:18.096 --> 04:20.063
Well, Leonard used to
do all these things,

04:20.065 --> 04:21.598
like bring me flowers

04:21.600 --> 04:24.201
and wear pants.

04:24.203 --> 04:27.270
It's okay,
Howie never has on pants.

04:27.272 --> 04:31.008
The Domino's guy brings
the pizza like this now.

04:31.010 --> 04:33.243
Well,
Sheldon always has his pants on.

04:33.245 --> 04:35.912
I don't think I could
pick his knees out of a lineup.

04:37.116 --> 04:38.248
Well, it's not
just the pants.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.616
Just, it's like since
we got married,

04:39.618 --> 04:41.318
he doesn't really
try anymore.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.786
Uh, Penny?

04:42.788 --> 04:44.054
I don't know how to say this,

04:44.056 --> 04:45.989
but this is
my first girls' night

04:45.991 --> 04:48.125
and you're kind of
bumming everybody out.

04:51.997 --> 04:54.398
All right, got Halley to sleep.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.099
Yeah, I heard you
on the baby monitor.

04:56.101 --> 04:58.368
Didn't think you could
turn the theme from <i>Walking Dead</i>

04:58.370 --> 05:00.303
into a lullaby.

05:01.407 --> 05:03.540
Yeah, got to get her
hooked on TV,

05:03.542 --> 05:06.243
or someday,
she'll want me to play outside.

05:07.046 --> 05:09.746
Boy, that floor is so squeaky.

05:09.748 --> 05:12.749
I'm surprised I didn't wake
her up walking out of the room.

05:12.751 --> 05:14.451
Have you tried anything
to fix it?

05:14.453 --> 05:16.286
Well, I put the rug down.

05:16.288 --> 05:17.387
It didn't help.

05:17.389 --> 05:20.090
I know. Blue shag.
What were you thinking?

05:21.760 --> 05:25.529
Did try nailing a couple
of the boards down.

05:25.531 --> 05:26.596
Did that do anything?

05:26.598 --> 05:28.231
Yeah, it left little
holes in the floor,

05:28.233 --> 05:29.633
that's why I
bought the rug.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:38.010 --> 05:41.344
If you do that,
I'll win in eight moves.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.554
I'll win in five moves.

05:56.995 --> 05:59.062
I'll win in one move.

06:01.266 --> 06:03.467
Oh, no. Good game.

06:05.671 --> 06:07.003
Hey.

06:07.005 --> 06:08.171
Hey.

06:08.173 --> 06:09.539
Oh, Penny,
I'm trying

06:09.541 --> 06:11.374
to take an interest
in other people.

06:11.376 --> 06:13.110
Uh, how was
your girls' night?

06:13.112 --> 06:14.411
Oh, it was fine.

06:14.413 --> 06:16.680
Hmm. Did you have
anything to eat?

06:16.682 --> 06:18.215
Uh, chips.

06:18.217 --> 06:20.117
(stammers)
Anything to drink?

06:20.119 --> 06:21.518
Some wine.

06:21.520 --> 06:26.256
Well, I'm just playing tennis
against the drapes here.

06:26.258 --> 06:27.924
Just ignore him.

06:27.926 --> 06:29.726
Hmm. At least he took
an interest.

06:29.728 --> 06:31.962
What's that supposed to mean?

06:31.964 --> 06:33.063
Nothing.

06:33.065 --> 06:34.364
Hey, what's going on with you?

06:34.366 --> 06:35.966
I don't want to
talk about it.

06:35.968 --> 06:37.701
Well, hey,
come on, just tell me.

06:37.703 --> 06:40.237
Fine.

06:40.239 --> 06:41.872
Lately, I kind
of feel like

06:41.874 --> 06:43.173
you've been taking
me for granted.

06:43.175 --> 06:45.509
Wh-what? Where is this
coming from?

06:45.511 --> 06:46.676
SHELDON:
Leonard.

06:46.678 --> 06:47.677
She might be drunk.

06:47.679 --> 06:50.413
All she had was chips.

06:50.415 --> 06:52.249
It's just, since we got married
you seem to think

06:52.251 --> 06:54.050
you don't have to try anymore.

06:54.052 --> 06:56.286
That is ridiculous.

06:56.288 --> 06:57.888
This is exactly why I didn't
want to talk about it.

06:57.890 --> 06:59.322
No, No, no, no.
Let's talk about it.

06:59.324 --> 07:00.857
I'm the one who's made
all the effort

07:00.859 --> 07:02.692
in this relationship
since day one.

07:02.694 --> 07:04.661
Please tell me
what more I could do.

07:04.663 --> 07:07.030
Okay. You know what?
Maybe I'll take Amy with me

07:07.032 --> 07:08.832
to the spa this weekend instead.

07:08.834 --> 07:10.967
Fine, go ahead.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.874
Amy is free.

07:19.278 --> 07:21.278
She had a harp lesson
on Saturday,

07:21.280 --> 07:23.013
but it got canceled...

07:23.015 --> 07:25.582
Boy, when you take an interest
in people,

07:25.584 --> 07:28.718
you really uncork
a geyser of nonsense.

07:31.657 --> 07:34.024
Okay.
Thanks, Daddy.

07:34.026 --> 07:37.227
He said the only way to really
fix an old floor like that

07:37.229 --> 07:39.563
is to tear it up
and replace the whole thing.

07:39.565 --> 07:41.498
That sounds expensive.
Hang on.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.066
No offense to her father,

07:43.068 --> 07:45.302
but he's not an
MIT-trained engineer.

07:45.304 --> 07:47.237
Thinking and building
is what you do.

07:47.239 --> 07:49.406
MIT's motto is
"Mind and hand,"

07:49.408 --> 07:53.143
which just so happens was also
my motto as a lonely teenager.

07:54.513 --> 07:57.480
Oh, come on. We just need
to be more creative.

07:57.482 --> 08:01.117
What if you didn't step
on the floor at all?

08:01.119 --> 08:02.385
Like, what if you...

08:02.387 --> 08:05.755
swung on a rope
from the ceiling?

08:07.059 --> 08:08.291
(grunts)

08:08.293 --> 08:11.127
(groans)

08:12.898 --> 08:14.864
No.

08:14.866 --> 08:16.399
Okay. Um...

08:16.401 --> 08:18.802
Okay. What if you rig up
a pulley system

08:18.804 --> 08:21.404
and move yourself across
the room in a harness?

08:27.779 --> 08:29.980
(creaking)

08:33.952 --> 08:35.818
No.

08:36.655 --> 08:37.953
BERNADETTE:
I have one.

08:37.956 --> 08:39.823
What if you got
a giant slingshot

08:39.825 --> 08:41.991
and flung yourself
into the wall?

08:43.695 --> 08:45.295
Is that supposed
to be funny?

08:45.297 --> 08:46.830
Hold on.

08:48.267 --> 08:49.699
(screaming)

08:53.572 --> 08:55.438
Yeah, that's funny.

08:57.643 --> 08:59.876
- All right, we're heading out.
- Mm-hmm.

08:59.878 --> 09:02.412
I'll call you when
we get to the hotel.

09:02.414 --> 09:05.015
And if they have any of those
tiny bottles of shampoo?

09:05.017 --> 09:06.750
I will bring them home
so you can show me

09:06.752 --> 09:08.084
how Godzilla takes a shower.

09:09.721 --> 09:11.021
Have fun.
Thanks.

09:11.023 --> 09:12.055
Are you ready?

09:12.057 --> 09:13.456
Uh-huh.

09:13.458 --> 09:14.858
Bye, Sheldon.

09:14.860 --> 09:16.259
You know what?

09:16.261 --> 09:18.628
I feel uncomfortable engaging
in a public display of affection

09:18.630 --> 09:21.264
while their relationship
is strained.

09:21.266 --> 09:24.034
Go ahead, it's fine.

09:24.036 --> 09:26.269
Bye.
Bye.

09:32.544 --> 09:34.344
Okay!
Let's go!

09:37.482 --> 09:38.481
Bye.

09:38.483 --> 09:39.749
Bye.

09:39.751 --> 09:41.051
I'll miss you.

09:41.053 --> 09:42.352
Yeah, I'll miss you, too.

09:42.354 --> 09:43.687
I'll miss you more.

09:43.689 --> 09:45.789
Well, if X equals the amount
that you'll miss me,

09:45.791 --> 09:47.424
then I'll miss you X plus one.
(giggles)

09:47.426 --> 09:50.393
If you miss me X plus one,
I'll miss you

09:50.395 --> 09:52.962
open paren X plus one,
close paren to the second...

09:55.834 --> 09:58.034
Thank you.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.905
You're sad, so I made you tea.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.508
Thanks.

10:11.050 --> 10:12.370
And it's just the way
you like it.

10:12.748 --> 10:14.214
Earl Grey?
Yes.

10:14.216 --> 10:15.215
Honey?
Yes.

10:15.217 --> 10:16.149
Unsweetened almond--
Good Lord!

10:16.151 --> 10:18.818
I made you tea.
Just drink it!

10:20.656 --> 10:22.522
Sorry, thank you.

10:22.524 --> 10:26.293
Well, what can we do
to cheer you up?

10:26.295 --> 10:28.261
I really don't know.

10:28.263 --> 10:30.330
You want to play <i>Jenga?</i>

10:30.332 --> 10:32.032
Or, uh, <i>Ticket to Ride?</i>

10:32.034 --> 10:33.133
<i>Hearthstone?</i>

10:33.135 --> 10:37.938
I-- what would you be
the happiest losing at?

10:39.741 --> 10:41.575
I don't want to
play a game, Sheldon.

10:41.577 --> 10:46.513
Wow, and I remember when you
loved playing games with me.

10:46.515 --> 10:49.316
Maybe Penny isn't the only
relationship you're phoning in.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.553
It's not that I'd
stopped trying,

10:53.555 --> 10:56.556
it's just how
relationships progress.

10:56.558 --> 10:58.458
They start with infatuation,

10:58.460 --> 11:01.962
but over time mellow into
something more comfortable.

11:01.964 --> 11:04.064
Hmm. Yeah, you're right.

11:04.066 --> 11:05.665
It's like when
I first encountered

11:05.667 --> 11:07.234
the Pythagorean Theorem.

11:07.236 --> 11:08.702
You know,
I was blown away

11:08.704 --> 11:10.704
that the square
of the hypotenuse

11:10.706 --> 11:13.540
was the sum of the squares
of the opposite sides.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.243
Yeah, but now
I'm just like "eh."

11:19.948 --> 11:23.250
Okay, this grid
represents the room.

11:23.252 --> 11:27.420
All we need to do is plot out
where each squeak is

11:27.422 --> 11:29.823
and we can find a quiet
path to the crib.

11:32.427 --> 11:34.761
It looks like a map
from <i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i>

11:34.763 --> 11:36.229
Mm.

11:36.231 --> 11:39.699
Except the creature in the crib
is a level-nine poop monster.

11:39.701 --> 11:42.602
Okay, uh, you check
for squeaks,

11:42.604 --> 11:44.070
and I will
mark them down.

11:44.072 --> 11:45.372
(floor squeaking)
Okay.

11:45.374 --> 11:48.441
Space A-3, here we go.

11:48.443 --> 11:50.577
(squeaking)

11:51.647 --> 11:54.014
It's squeaking. Mark it.

11:54.016 --> 11:56.850
It's nice to think that
you grew up in this room

11:56.852 --> 11:58.485
and now your daughter's
going to as well.

11:58.487 --> 12:02.322
Mm. I hope she has the same
amount of sex in it I did.

12:02.324 --> 12:03.857
None. Next square.

12:07.396 --> 12:09.562
Why do you bounce with your
hands in the air like that?

12:09.564 --> 12:12.332
(chuckles)
It's a tradition of my people.

12:12.334 --> 12:14.067
♪ If I were a rich man ♪

12:14.069 --> 12:16.269
(vocalizing)

12:18.440 --> 12:20.073
"Material Girl"
needs to be retired.

12:20.075 --> 12:22.609
That is your karaoke song.

12:25.547 --> 12:29.449
Would you like to play
a driving game I invented?

12:29.451 --> 12:32.686
Is it about the failing state
of my relationship with Penny?

12:33.522 --> 12:35.555
Never mind.

12:37.359 --> 12:40.093
You know, Penny went to this spa
to be away from you.

12:40.095 --> 12:41.861
Are you sure
you should be going there?

12:41.863 --> 12:44.631
I don't want to wait two days
for us to work this out.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.633
Very well.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.368
You got married
spur of the moment.

12:48.370 --> 12:51.204
I don't see why your
divorce should be any different.

12:52.407 --> 12:54.307
I would pull this car over
and kick you out,

12:54.309 --> 12:58.411
but... if Penny dumps me,
you're all I got.

13:01.550 --> 13:04.384
When was the last time
you got a massage?

13:04.386 --> 13:06.286
Sheldon walked on my back
two weeks ago,

13:06.288 --> 13:08.388
but that was just 'cause
there was a spider on his pillow

13:08.390 --> 13:10.657
and he was trying to get away.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.859
Leonard stood on me once, too,

13:12.861 --> 13:16.463
but he was just trying
to see the Rose Parade.

13:16.465 --> 13:17.831
(knocking)

13:17.833 --> 13:18.932
I don't know the protocol,

13:18.934 --> 13:21.134
are you gonna be naked
for your massage?

13:21.136 --> 13:22.302
Well. Yeah.

13:22.304 --> 13:25.905
Hmm. Then this is probably
too many clothes.

13:27.509 --> 13:28.775
Hey.

13:28.777 --> 13:30.243
What are you doing here?

13:30.245 --> 13:31.711
I came here to apologize.

13:31.713 --> 13:33.113
Okay. Leonard,
I really appreciate that,

13:33.115 --> 13:35.815
but I need a little time
to myself.

13:35.817 --> 13:37.317
Wha... Okay. I don't get it.

13:37.319 --> 13:38.752
You said make an effort.

13:38.754 --> 13:40.687
Here I am, making an effort.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.655
Hello, Amy. It's
nice to see you.

13:42.657 --> 13:46.426
Nice to see you, too.

13:46.428 --> 13:50.029
And that's how you make
effort look effortless.

13:50.031 --> 13:51.231
All right.
Can you please just go

13:51.233 --> 13:52.465
and we'll talk
about this tomorrow?

13:52.467 --> 13:53.466
I don't understand
what you want!

13:53.468 --> 13:55.168
I'm trying to figure it out!

13:55.170 --> 13:56.302
You know what? If you'd like,

13:56.304 --> 13:59.139
I could whip up a quick
Relationship Agreement.

14:00.242 --> 14:01.274
Well, I'm at a spa,

14:01.276 --> 14:03.943
might as well do
something relaxing.

14:03.945 --> 14:06.079
Sheldon, why don't
we give them some privacy?

14:06.081 --> 14:08.381
(sighs)
Very well.

14:08.383 --> 14:09.816
Hey. Later, we'll check
out the minibar?

14:09.818 --> 14:13.052
I'll show you
how Godzilla gets drunk.

14:15.590 --> 14:19.058
So what we did was map
out the entire room

14:19.060 --> 14:22.095
to identify every squeak.

14:22.097 --> 14:24.431
Watch. It's easy,
once you get the hang of it.

14:24.433 --> 14:26.666
(clears throat)

14:26.668 --> 14:29.369
Step.

14:29.371 --> 14:32.338
Step.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.974
Hop onto ottoman.

14:34.976 --> 14:38.912
Don't do that in socks,
I almost broke my neck.

14:38.914 --> 14:40.914
Then simply sit,

14:40.916 --> 14:43.316
spin, stand,

14:43.318 --> 14:45.518
stretch...

14:49.191 --> 14:51.324
Maybe unloosen your pants.

14:52.661 --> 14:54.894
And... step,

14:54.896 --> 14:56.696
grab, tiny pivot,

14:56.698 --> 14:58.832
pull, and you're there.

14:59.901 --> 15:01.734
(sighs)
Easy, peasy, mac and...

15:01.736 --> 15:04.237
(exhales)
You get the idea.

15:04.239 --> 15:06.739
You actually expect me
to do this

15:06.741 --> 15:08.908
while holding a baby
in the dark?

15:08.910 --> 15:11.578
Hold on...

15:17.686 --> 15:19.152
I don't think she was impressed.

15:19.154 --> 15:20.687
Bigger problems.

15:20.689 --> 15:23.790
I felt something pop.

15:25.927 --> 15:29.162
There's a cucumber
in my water.

15:29.164 --> 15:30.463
Uh-huh.

15:32.033 --> 15:33.166
Do they know it's there?

15:33.168 --> 15:35.268
Um, sh-should I tell somebody?

15:35.270 --> 15:37.170
It's there on purpose.

15:37.172 --> 15:39.138
It's refreshing.

15:43.645 --> 15:45.178
Interesting.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.746
The world's most boring liquid

15:46.748 --> 15:48.515
and the world's
most boring vegetable.

15:48.517 --> 15:51.084
But you put 'em together,
and bleh.

15:53.021 --> 15:54.521
Hey.
Hi.

15:54.523 --> 15:56.756
Oh! Good, you're here.
Are you still fighting?

15:56.758 --> 15:59.325
If you get divorced,
do I get two Christmases?

15:59.327 --> 16:01.828
We're not getting divorced.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.264
Listen, we realized, that, uh...

16:04.266 --> 16:06.432
we're facing some new challenges

16:06.434 --> 16:07.634
as a married couple.

16:07.636 --> 16:08.735
PENNY:
Yeah. And there are a few things

16:08.737 --> 16:10.570
we need to stay on top of.
So we thought

16:10.572 --> 16:12.605
it would useful--

16:12.607 --> 16:14.807
and I can't believe
I am about to say this--

16:14.809 --> 16:16.242
um...

16:16.244 --> 16:18.811
Would you please help us
make a Relationship Agreement?

16:21.216 --> 16:23.616
But one that's tailored to us.

16:23.618 --> 16:25.618
Okay? We don't need
a bathroom schedule.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.254
Although a rule about him
texting me from in there

16:28.256 --> 16:30.990
might help with the romance.

16:32.294 --> 16:33.326
What do you say?

16:33.328 --> 16:35.628
I get to write a contract?

16:35.630 --> 16:37.997
I say, let's get this party
of the first part started!

16:37.999 --> 16:41.200
(they laugh)

16:41.202 --> 16:44.804
(whoops, mutters)

16:44.806 --> 16:46.906
Do you really think
that's funny?

16:46.908 --> 16:49.008
It's in our agreement.
I have to laugh.

16:53.662 --> 16:55.862
If you find this
draft acceptable,

16:55.864 --> 16:58.965
then I believe your new
Relationship Agreement

16:58.967 --> 17:00.733
is ready to be signed.

17:00.735 --> 17:02.502
Article 8, subsection B:

17:02.504 --> 17:04.904
Leonard will restrict
video-gaming in underpants

17:04.906 --> 17:06.806
to hours Penny is not home.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.209
This includes boxers,
briefs, thongs, G-strings

17:09.211 --> 17:10.944
or anything else
that calls attention

17:10.945 --> 17:12.744
to his pasty little thighs.

17:17.085 --> 17:18.518
Does it really need to say that?

17:18.520 --> 17:21.954
I did this for free,
let me get a little something.

17:23.224 --> 17:25.525
Article 10, subsection C:

17:25.527 --> 17:28.127
If questioned, Penny
may not say that everything

17:28.128 --> 17:29.929
is fine if it isn't.

17:29.931 --> 17:32.498
Other unacceptable responses
include: "It's nothing,"

17:32.500 --> 17:35.101
"Don't worry about it,"
and "I said it's nothing,

17:35.103 --> 17:37.937
don't worry about it."

17:37.939 --> 17:39.939
I think this all looks good.

17:39.941 --> 17:41.407
Me, too.

17:41.409 --> 17:42.609
Oh, well. Great,
then. Here.

17:42.611 --> 17:45.645
You sign here, date here.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.747
And, Penny, if you could
initial here to indicate

17:47.749 --> 17:50.750
that you're accepting Leonard
in "as is" condition.

17:57.692 --> 18:00.560
Aw. I remember signing our first
Relationship Agreement.

18:00.562 --> 18:03.263
Mm. You seem to be forgetting
the "no nostalgia" clause.

18:03.265 --> 18:04.731
Right, right. Got it.
