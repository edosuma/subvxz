00:29.906 --> 00:32.174
Looks like you
only have three more minutes.

00:32.208 --> 00:34.043
How disappointing that must be?

00:34.076 --> 00:36.879
Forget about the others,
keep trying the door.

00:36.913 --> 00:37.846
Oh snap.

00:45.121 --> 00:46.821
There has
to be a way out.

00:48.523 --> 00:49.457
Guys, it's open.

00:55.797 --> 00:56.598
Oh God.

00:57.934 --> 00:59.467
I don't
mean to baby you

00:59.501 --> 01:01.636
but you only have two more
minutes to try and escape.

01:03.672 --> 01:04.472
It's locked.

01:04.506 --> 01:06.042
No shit.

01:10.578 --> 01:12.949
My mama says
that they're not real

01:12.982 --> 01:14.449
but they haunt me.

01:14.482 --> 01:17.819
Every since I can remember,
I've been followed by ghosts.

01:17.852 --> 01:21.023
The only place they don't
bug me is under my bed.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.734
What do we do?

01:34.136 --> 01:35.503
How do we get out?

01:49.352 --> 01:50.920
Keep looking
for a clue, a key,

01:50.953 --> 01:53.356
something to get us out of here.

02:02.797 --> 02:04.367
This is so weird.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.335
Hey, I found
another weird thing.

02:06.369 --> 02:08.371
- Only 30 seconds.
- You guys, hurry.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.540
There's magnets on top of these.

02:12.574 --> 02:13.575
Give me the bottles.

02:17.579 --> 02:18.813
There's got to be one more.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.648
- Come on, come on.
- I got it, here.

02:27.056 --> 02:28.790
It's a distraction.

02:30.893 --> 02:34.196
Congratulations, you guys
just became the first test group

02:34.230 --> 02:35.797
to make it out alive.

02:35.830 --> 02:37.266
That was insane.

02:37.299 --> 02:38.501
Oh good.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.236
I really thought we
were gonna die in there.

02:40.269 --> 02:41.770
Yes.

02:41.803 --> 02:43.272
That was the best
escape room I've ever done.

02:43.305 --> 02:44.706
Key.

02:44.739 --> 02:46.175
Can't wait to see what
mystery you guys pick up next.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.043
Get out.

05:08.150 --> 05:09.118
Morning.

05:09.151 --> 05:09.985
Hey.

05:26.969 --> 05:27.802
Yeah.

06:16.719 --> 06:17.553
Bye babe.

06:34.336 --> 06:37.940
Name was Annie and it had
very purply rainbowish scales

06:37.973 --> 06:39.408
and I absolutely loved it

06:39.441 --> 06:41.176
and I woke up one morning
and it was just gone.

06:41.210 --> 06:42.945
I have no idea what happened.

06:42.978 --> 06:44.346
You know, it was very sad.

07:08.137 --> 07:09.271
It's here, the monster's back.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.674
Please help, the
monster's in my room.

07:11.707 --> 07:14.410
It's in my room, the
monster's in my room.

07:14.443 --> 07:16.645
Please help, help!

07:16.679 --> 07:19.248
There's a monster in
here, it's over there.

07:19.281 --> 07:21.884
No, I'm not okay, I'm not okay.

07:23.018 --> 07:28.023
No, I'm not okay.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.228
She's okay.

07:33.262 --> 07:37.199
Like I said, she still
needs to eat her food.

07:37.232 --> 07:38.634
She had another psychotic break.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.968
She's not listening

07:40.002 --> 07:41.804
and she needs four more shots

07:41.836 --> 07:43.439
and I suggest we
add another one on.

07:43.472 --> 07:46.075
I think that that
would really help a lot

07:46.108 --> 07:47.876
if we do something like that.

07:47.910 --> 07:49.678
All right.

08:03.459 --> 08:04.426
It wasn't me.

08:04.460 --> 08:05.427
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

08:05.461 --> 08:07.963
Stop, stop, stop it wasn't me.

08:08.964 --> 08:10.432
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

08:10.466 --> 08:11.367
Stop, stop!

08:12.334 --> 08:13.602
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

08:13.635 --> 08:14.470
Stop!

08:22.945 --> 08:23.946
He's late.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.549
He's always fucking late.

08:28.417 --> 08:29.251
Patience.

08:30.953 --> 08:31.920
Smooth run tonight.

08:34.022 --> 08:37.526
The trap doors, the puzzles,
clues are easy enough.

08:39.828 --> 08:41.764
It only took 17 years.

08:41.797 --> 08:43.198
Patience is a virtue.

08:46.602 --> 08:47.503
Hey, hey.

08:51.473 --> 08:52.841
Where were you?

08:52.876 --> 08:55.644
I got caught up
at the pharmacy.

08:55.677 --> 08:57.279
Do we have a problem?

08:57.312 --> 09:01.517
Uh no, no problem, man,

09:01.550 --> 09:02.851
I got the stuff right here.

09:04.653 --> 09:05.621
Well, man,

09:07.523 --> 09:09.324
did you get everything we need?

09:09.358 --> 09:11.627
Yeah, it's all there.

09:11.660 --> 09:14.630
I even threw in a couple
extra needles, just in case.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.166
Look, I wrote down
my clear instructions

09:17.199 --> 09:18.333
on how to use it.

09:18.367 --> 09:19.903
This is some serious
shit, though.

09:19.935 --> 09:20.836
Are you sure you
guys don't need me

09:20.869 --> 09:22.304
to help administer the dose?

09:29.678 --> 09:31.947
Look at the fine mess
you've made, Tabitha.

09:33.816 --> 09:37.519
Please, I was just
starting to clean up.

09:40.823 --> 09:43.525
The boss
isn't gonna like this.

09:53.602 --> 09:54.603
Next please.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.139
Hi, can I get a black coffee,

09:57.172 --> 09:59.575
two bear claws and...

09:59.608 --> 10:00.976
We're actually out of
bear claws right now.

10:01.009 --> 10:02.211
Is there anything
else you'd like?

10:02.244 --> 10:04.813
Oh okay, what do
you want sweetheart?

10:04.847 --> 10:06.148
Donut holes.

10:06.181 --> 10:07.549
You want donut holes?

10:07.583 --> 10:08.750
Okay, that's fine.

10:08.784 --> 10:11.153
All right, so it'll
be $15.75 please.

10:11.186 --> 10:12.020
Awesome.

10:14.389 --> 10:17.593
Oh crap, oh no, I think
I forgot my wallet.

10:17.626 --> 10:18.962
Oh my gosh.

10:19.027 --> 10:20.395
I'm so sorry, hold
on one moment.

10:20.429 --> 10:21.597
I got this.

10:21.630 --> 10:22.397
No, you don't
have to, it's okay.

10:22.431 --> 10:23.499
I want to.

10:23.532 --> 10:24.366
Well...

10:25.534 --> 10:26.535
Thank you, that's
really kind of you.

10:26.568 --> 10:27.769
No, it's no problem.

10:28.704 --> 10:29.505
Can you say thank you

10:29.538 --> 10:30.974
to this nice gentleman?

10:31.006 --> 10:31.807
Thank you.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.674
It's my pleasure.

10:51.059 --> 10:52.427
How's the clean up coming?

10:53.930 --> 10:55.999
Just another
drug deal gone bad.

11:07.776 --> 11:09.611
Such a shame really,

11:09.645 --> 11:11.813
everyone so hoped
that legalizing

11:11.847 --> 11:13.215
would quell criminality.

11:15.851 --> 11:19.022
Your efforts are
greatly appreciated.

11:23.927 --> 11:25.861
I live a life of service.

11:44.613 --> 11:46.448
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:46.481 --> 11:47.749
What?

11:47.783 --> 11:49.217
It's a rental.

11:49.251 --> 11:53.455
Look, my boy Mattie has
found the one, I'm celebrating.

11:53.488 --> 11:55.024
The one?

11:55.058 --> 11:55.925
Please.

11:56.893 --> 11:59.361
Do I detect a little jealousy?

11:59.394 --> 12:01.229
Yeah, that's it.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.864
It's all right,
that's your ex,

12:02.899 --> 12:04.800
I feel it, I feel it.

12:04.833 --> 12:05.734
Feeling like you
married the wrong guy?

12:05.767 --> 12:07.803
If I had married Mattie,

12:07.836 --> 12:11.373
I wouldn't have to keep
asking him for money.

12:21.550 --> 12:25.754
Alrighty, let's
get you all buckled.

12:25.787 --> 12:26.688
Ah crap.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.359
Hey, hey, hey, I
got you, I got you.

12:32.527 --> 12:34.363
What are you, like my
guardian angel or something?

12:34.396 --> 12:35.664
Maybe.

12:37.499 --> 12:38.333
Hold on.

12:39.701 --> 12:41.336
Oh hi honey.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.538
Yeah, I realize that.

12:44.673 --> 12:46.842
Well, you know, actually
the person behind us

12:46.876 --> 12:48.276
offered to pay.

12:49.177 --> 12:50.579
It was really nice of him.

12:51.747 --> 12:54.549
Well yeah, we're on
our way back right now.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.418
I love you too.

12:56.451 --> 12:57.853
Okay bye.

12:57.887 --> 12:59.154
I'm sorry about that

12:59.187 --> 13:01.723
but thank you again, I
really appreciate it.

13:01.757 --> 13:03.792
Here, in case you
ever need to call

13:03.825 --> 13:04.961
on your guardian angel.

13:06.129 --> 13:10.232
I just might do
that, thank you.

13:11.366 --> 13:12.868
Are you ready to go see daddy?

13:13.869 --> 13:14.703
Yeah.

13:48.603 --> 13:51.573
Hi, I'm so glad you made it.

13:51.606 --> 13:53.308
Hi, nice to finally meet you.

13:54.476 --> 13:57.646
Tyler, I've heard
a lot of stories.

13:57.679 --> 13:59.481
I bet.

13:59.514 --> 14:01.483
It's so nice to see you.

14:01.516 --> 14:02.517
Can I help you with your bag?

14:02.551 --> 14:03.886
No, I'm good.

14:09.858 --> 14:10.859
There he is.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.562
It's good to see you, man.

14:13.595 --> 14:14.964
Good to see you.

14:19.035 --> 14:20.169
I like your new toy.

14:21.170 --> 14:22.771
She's pretty great.

14:23.973 --> 14:26.109
Hey babe, why don't you
show 'em the guest room?

14:27.375 --> 14:28.777
I'm gonna take a quick swim.

14:29.879 --> 14:32.614
Okay, let's go.

14:47.163 --> 14:49.065
Matthew wanted to make
sure you were comfortable.

14:49.098 --> 14:49.899
I'm wet.

14:50.832 --> 14:51.867
Do you need anything?

14:51.901 --> 14:53.668
We'll just get settled in.

14:53.702 --> 14:56.438
Great, you settle
in and I'll be around.

15:43.119 --> 15:44.719
Need a hand?

15:58.366 --> 15:59.936
It's very clever.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.040
Halloween 1995.

16:05.574 --> 16:08.577
Really, you're gonna go there?

16:10.612 --> 16:12.949
What happened Halloween 1995?

16:12.982 --> 16:14.917
Come on, Ang, like
you need another reason?

16:14.951 --> 16:16.319
We were drunk,

16:16.351 --> 16:20.555
just skating around
looking for a little party.

16:20.589 --> 16:21.423
Matt.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.293
Ease up, all right?

16:26.561 --> 16:28.630
So we come across this
old house that's for sale.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.367
It's completely empty,

16:32.400 --> 16:34.036
teenage boy's dream.

16:36.272 --> 16:38.874
Well Tyler decides
to pull the old B&E.

16:38.908 --> 16:40.343
Tyler decides?

16:40.375 --> 16:42.544
Okay, all right, I don't think
I like your tone brother.

16:42.577 --> 16:44.412
He just starts
tearing the place up.

16:44.446 --> 16:45.348
I start tearing?

16:45.380 --> 16:46.815
Okay, what were you doing, hmm,

16:46.848 --> 16:49.886
just knitting in the corner
like a good upstanding citizen?

16:49.919 --> 16:51.320
Would you expect any less?

16:52.321 --> 16:53.289
You guys are so dumb.

16:53.322 --> 16:55.958
And you didn't get caught?

16:55.992 --> 16:57.260
No, just wait.

16:57.293 --> 16:58.094
Hey.

17:01.297 --> 17:03.531
So we're wasted.

17:03.565 --> 17:04.866
Boys will be boys.

17:06.668 --> 17:08.371
And there's a
knock at the door.

17:16.711 --> 17:17.612
Just stop.

17:17.646 --> 17:18.915
Tyler puts his mask back on

17:20.448 --> 17:22.184
to do some weird shit.

17:24.619 --> 17:25.854
Why are you doing this?

17:28.857 --> 17:30.126
And it was the cops.

17:32.161 --> 17:33.828
Tyler literally pisses himself.

17:33.862 --> 17:35.664
He's sitting there
bawling in tears.

17:37.732 --> 17:39.834
We did a 12 hour
stint in juvey

17:39.868 --> 17:42.405
waiting for our
parents to show up.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.306
Mattie's mom was pissed.

17:43.339 --> 17:44.639
No shit.

17:46.641 --> 17:50.445
To Mattie, the best
worst sidekick ever.

17:50.478 --> 17:51.479
Cheers.

17:58.888 --> 17:59.989
More wine?

18:00.022 --> 18:00.822
Yes, please.

18:00.855 --> 18:03.025
In fact, I'll help you.

18:03.059 --> 18:04.193
Yes, please.

18:11.167 --> 18:12.667
Wrong number?

18:12.701 --> 18:14.803
Ain't nothing
wrong about that.

18:16.405 --> 18:18.908
Still the same old dog, huh?

18:18.941 --> 18:20.608
I got a few new tricks.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.644
I've known Mattie
a very long time.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.715
They're very close.

18:26.748 --> 18:28.717
They share everything.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.021
What about her?

18:32.054 --> 18:33.621
I thought you said
she was the one?

18:33.655 --> 18:34.556
No, she's great.

18:35.757 --> 18:37.625
Not smart enough
to ask questions,

18:37.659 --> 18:40.296
hungry enough to appreciate
what I provide for her.

18:40.329 --> 18:41.696
They share everything,

18:43.432 --> 18:46.469
everything but secrets.

18:58.381 --> 18:59.181
And that ass.

18:59.215 --> 19:00.049
And that ass.

19:01.384 --> 19:03.785
But man, you are always the man.

19:11.427 --> 19:13.496
We'll have a night
cap in the pool.

19:16.499 --> 19:18.034
Babe, wear that suit
we got in Italy.

19:20.503 --> 19:23.172
Do you hear yourself?

19:23.205 --> 19:24.739
You are too much.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.113
I'm drunk, sorry.

19:34.116 --> 19:35.351
You ever get nervous?

19:35.384 --> 19:37.053
How wasted are you?

19:37.086 --> 19:38.220
Very.

19:40.389 --> 19:44.326
You got all this shit,
house, job, this life.

19:48.064 --> 19:49.432
Do you ever get nervous

19:49.465 --> 19:51.400
that one day it could
all just go away?

19:56.838 --> 19:57.672
No.

20:01.010 --> 20:03.079
Shit man, sometimes I wake
up in the middle of the night

20:03.112 --> 20:04.779
clenching my chest.

20:06.982 --> 20:10.386
You ever think do you
really deserve this life?

20:10.419 --> 20:11.253
Easy.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.090
I don't
know how you do it.

20:16.559 --> 20:17.393
I know I can

20:19.995 --> 20:21.497
so I do.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.398
I guess.

20:23.731 --> 20:25.834
Dude, you live dangerously
close to the line.

20:27.369 --> 20:29.071
I'm done with
this conversation.

20:36.112 --> 20:37.246
Does this bother you?

20:40.082 --> 20:42.017
It's nothing Mattie
hasn't seen before.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.224
Angela hates me.

20:50.526 --> 20:54.430
Yeah well, Ang is a
fucking monster cunt.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.132
You bet she is.

20:59.902 --> 21:01.070
What was that?

21:06.408 --> 21:09.178
A crow, hit the window.

21:12.248 --> 21:13.315
Is it dead?

21:15.251 --> 21:16.085
No.

21:21.123 --> 21:22.491
Is it suffering?

21:25.561 --> 21:26.861
It won't die for awhile.

21:35.404 --> 21:36.238
I was nine

21:38.007 --> 21:39.807
and Mandy was six.

21:41.477 --> 21:42.912
Oh I made it.

21:42.945 --> 21:44.146
Go Mandy, hurry!

21:45.780 --> 21:47.650
We were just little girls.

21:53.289 --> 21:54.089
Hey.

21:55.591 --> 21:56.525
Hi.

21:56.559 --> 21:57.493
What are you guys doing?

21:57.526 --> 21:58.826
Playing with my sister.

22:01.330 --> 22:02.565
Looks fun.

22:02.598 --> 22:03.365
Yeah.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.536
Come on, girls, lunch
is ready, let's go.

22:15.044 --> 22:19.148
Please mama, please let us
go trick-or-treating alone.

22:19.181 --> 22:20.683
I'm big enough to
watch out for sissy.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.085
Aw, big brave Emily.

22:23.118 --> 22:24.553
You swear you'll
look out for her?

22:24.587 --> 22:25.421
Swear.

22:26.488 --> 22:27.755
Okay then.

22:27.789 --> 22:28.691
Yeah!

22:28.723 --> 22:29.791
But come back before dark,

22:29.824 --> 22:30.693
don't go too far.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.262
Really look after your sister

22:33.295 --> 22:35.464
and don't take any open candy.

22:35.497 --> 22:36.632
We won't, mom.

22:36.665 --> 22:38.000
I love you, girls.

22:38.033 --> 22:40.236
Love you too, mama.

22:59.787 --> 23:01.190
Trick or treat.

23:03.993 --> 23:05.227
Trick or treat.

23:10.332 --> 23:11.600
Trick or treat.

23:15.070 --> 23:16.438
Huh!

23:16.472 --> 23:17.839
Mandy, where are you going?

23:17.872 --> 23:20.808
I don't think anyone's home.

23:54.376 --> 23:55.878
What's wrong?

23:55.911 --> 23:58.947
You don't have to be scared.

23:58.981 --> 24:00.349
I couldn't move.

24:01.650 --> 24:03.585
I was so scared by
what I was seeing.

24:08.757 --> 24:11.527
And I saw you for
what you really are.

24:12.827 --> 24:13.629
A monster.

24:39.822 --> 24:40.823
Mandy, no!

24:42.391 --> 24:43.225
Let me go!

24:44.426 --> 24:45.260
Let me go!

24:49.198 --> 24:50.032
Let me go!

24:51.367 --> 24:53.469
What did you do to Mandy?

24:54.903 --> 24:55.804
Come on
man, we got to,

24:55.838 --> 24:57.306
we got to call the cops, man.

24:57.339 --> 24:58.741
We got to get some help.

24:58.774 --> 25:00.609
What, what
do you want to do?

25:00.642 --> 25:01.810
She's already dead.

25:01.844 --> 25:02.811
Do you want to call the cops?

25:02.845 --> 25:04.046
I wonder what they would say

25:04.079 --> 25:04.847
if I told them I
stumbled upon you

25:04.880 --> 25:06.348
with two dead girls?

25:06.382 --> 25:07.282
Two?

25:07.316 --> 25:08.584
No man, this was an accident.

25:08.617 --> 25:10.052
We don't have to do this one.

25:10.085 --> 25:12.287
No, no, no Tyler,
this isn't an accident.

25:12.321 --> 25:14.757
This is kidnapping
and it's murder.

25:15.958 --> 25:17.426
Ah man,
we can't do this.

25:17.459 --> 25:18.427
I don't
know why he did it,

25:18.460 --> 25:19.628
officer, he's deranged.

25:19.661 --> 25:21.930
He lured these two
small girls into here.

25:21.964 --> 25:24.066
I thought we were just
gonna go trick or treating.

25:24.099 --> 25:25.501
Nah, they
wouldn't believe you.

25:25.534 --> 25:28.971
What, you think
they would believe you over me?

25:29.004 --> 25:30.172
Tell me why
you want to do this.

25:30.205 --> 25:32.107
Because
I fucking can.

25:36.880 --> 25:37.679
Come here.

25:37.713 --> 25:38.547
Come here.

25:40.649 --> 25:44.253
Now you have been a
bad little girl, Emily.

25:45.421 --> 25:47.222
You're jealous of
your little sister.

25:49.024 --> 25:51.427
You missed being the
only child, didn't you?

25:53.162 --> 25:55.631
You brought your sister
out here to kill her

25:55.664 --> 25:58.000
so you could be the
only child again.

25:59.735 --> 26:01.804
If you ever tell
anyone about this,

26:01.837 --> 26:05.374
and we'll kill the rest
of your family too.

26:15.851 --> 26:17.953
My baby sister's body.

27:04.233 --> 27:06.401
Are you seeing
the monsters right now?

27:06.435 --> 27:08.570
They're hiding.

27:08.604 --> 27:11.073
I see.

27:11.106 --> 27:16.111
No, no, no!

27:16.980 --> 27:19.181
Please, you have to help me.

27:19.214 --> 27:21.850
It's gonna kill me like
it killed my sister.

27:21.885 --> 27:24.853
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie, it's gonna be okay.

27:30.425 --> 27:31.593
Keep your mouth shut

27:32.828 --> 27:35.397
as you have been given lines

27:36.598 --> 27:39.501
and do not speak to the
participants at all.

27:43.071 --> 27:45.774
This is
a handsome crowd.

27:47.075 --> 27:48.544
Everyone was so happy to help.

27:49.778 --> 27:52.916
Well that really
warms my heart.

27:55.183 --> 27:57.486
And how are you this morning?

27:57.519 --> 27:59.321
I feel like it's Christmas Eve

27:59.354 --> 28:02.224
and I can't wait to open my
fucking Christmas present.

28:03.993 --> 28:06.728
And I've been such a
good little girl, daddy.

28:06.762 --> 28:08.965
Just a few hours more.

28:10.198 --> 28:12.801
The boss is really
pleased with us.

28:14.570 --> 28:17.706
You will all surely be
rewarded for your efforts.

28:20.977 --> 28:23.947
You cannot stray from the plan.

28:25.113 --> 28:27.516
You must remain in control.

28:29.018 --> 28:30.385
And whatever you do,

28:30.419 --> 28:32.021
you have to stay on schedule.

28:36.525 --> 28:37.626
You all look fabulous.

28:40.662 --> 28:41.563
You get dressed

28:43.865 --> 28:45.334
because it's showtime, folks.

28:49.638 --> 28:50.539
File out.

28:57.546 --> 28:58.380
You.

29:04.419 --> 29:07.289
Wow buddy,
this looks delicious.

29:07.322 --> 29:08.490
Just try it.

29:10.225 --> 29:12.061
Oh, saved by the buzz.

29:12.095 --> 29:14.830
Joe, I'm gonna take this.

29:14.863 --> 29:16.065
Hey.

29:16.099 --> 29:17.432
I was raw vegan for awhile

29:17.466 --> 29:20.003
but my doctor advised
me against it.

29:20.036 --> 29:21.971
Oh really?

29:22.005 --> 29:23.772
Matthew has me on
a jogging regimen,

29:23.805 --> 29:24.706
three miles a day.

29:27.110 --> 29:30.312
Matthew, are you
still doing Pilates?

29:33.382 --> 29:37.586
You know, I've been doing
Pilates, yoga, cross training,

29:37.619 --> 29:38.921
and I've been running
like eight miles.

29:38.955 --> 29:41.024
It's insane.

29:41.057 --> 29:41.958
It's like...

29:41.991 --> 29:43.458
Hey, so my buddy Joe

29:43.492 --> 29:45.260
has tickets to the
new escape room.

29:46.395 --> 29:49.798
Escape room, like
the Jodie Foster movie?

29:50.699 --> 29:52.634
No, that's Panic Room.

29:52.668 --> 29:55.104
Look, I got the trailer here.

29:55.138 --> 29:56.571
Can you play this on your TV?

30:00.977 --> 30:04.446
Stop in for a
visit to the Escape Hotel,

30:05.380 --> 30:07.649
a real life puzzle.

30:09.751 --> 30:11.653
Oh my God, I've never been
in an escape room before.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.321
I had no clue what
was gonna happen.

30:13.355 --> 30:14.924
I was freaked out of my mind.

30:14.957 --> 30:16.792
Where did I find the clues?

30:16.825 --> 30:18.260
I found the clues in
the weirdest places,

30:18.293 --> 30:20.163
where nobody should go.

30:20.195 --> 30:22.798
It was absolutely insane.

30:22.831 --> 30:24.000
We were running
down this hallway,

30:24.033 --> 30:26.169
we had no idea
which room it was.

30:26.201 --> 30:27.536
Sometimes I questioned
if the puzzles

30:27.569 --> 30:28.938
were actually part
of an escape room

30:28.971 --> 30:32.207
or if I was in some
Saw-like psycho's labyrinth.

30:33.109 --> 30:34.276
I was gonna die.

30:34.309 --> 30:35.277
I was like oh my God.

30:35.310 --> 30:38.613
Three, two, one, time's up.

30:39.848 --> 30:42.384
I don't get it, is
it a haunted house?

30:42.417 --> 30:43.920
No, like the video just said,

30:43.953 --> 30:46.155
an escape room is
a real life game

30:46.189 --> 30:48.057
where you're locked in a room

30:48.091 --> 30:49.491
and you have to use the
elements of the room

30:49.524 --> 30:50.792
to solve a series of puzzles

30:50.826 --> 30:53.062
and escape within
a set time limit.

30:53.096 --> 30:54.030
Exactly.

30:54.063 --> 30:54.997
And my buddy has four tickets.

30:55.031 --> 30:56.465
He was gonna go on a double date

30:56.498 --> 30:58.333
but the other couple canceled so

30:58.366 --> 30:59.634
he doesn't want to go alone.

30:59.668 --> 31:01.436
That's odd.

31:01.470 --> 31:04.173
Oh my gosh, that sounds
so fun, we should do it.

31:04.207 --> 31:07.642
Maybe it'll be like Saw

31:07.676 --> 31:11.080
and I get to choose whether
I survive or kill my husband.

31:11.981 --> 31:14.716
Don't laugh, she's serious.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.585
What do you think babe?

31:17.987 --> 31:20.056
Sure, why not?

31:22.257 --> 31:23.625
My man.

32:14.243 --> 32:15.945
Welcome to the Escape Hotel.

32:15.978 --> 32:17.880
What is your business here?

32:17.914 --> 32:20.183
We have reservations for
the Crime and Justice room.

32:20.216 --> 32:23.451
Ah, so you're surrendering
yourselves to the court?

32:23.485 --> 32:26.189
Oh come on, we're here for
the escape room bullshit.

32:27.689 --> 32:28.690
Follow me.

32:49.912 --> 32:52.014
This is extremely impressive.

32:53.815 --> 32:55.517
Lieutenant, these
must be the last

32:55.550 --> 32:57.286
of the suspects to surrender.

32:58.420 --> 32:59.454
Come on.

33:06.728 --> 33:08.430
Summons and identification.

33:09.731 --> 33:11.267
Really?

33:11.300 --> 33:14.237
Summons and identification

33:14.270 --> 33:16.638
or we can do this the hard way.

33:16.671 --> 33:18.874
Nope, sorry, I got it.

33:21.010 --> 33:22.345
Here you go,

33:22.377 --> 33:24.113
Tyler Jones, party of four.

33:25.982 --> 33:30.987
Brittany Lamb, Angela Lopez,
Tyler Jones, Matthew Blake,

33:33.289 --> 33:35.624
you are under
arrest in connection

33:35.657 --> 33:38.727
to the disappearance
of two little girls.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.196
Really?

33:40.229 --> 33:41.364
It's part of it.

33:42.530 --> 33:44.599
We've combed every
nook and cranny

33:44.633 --> 33:46.768
looking for those little girls.

33:46.801 --> 33:48.703
Not one trace of their body.

33:48.737 --> 33:49.939
Their bodies?

33:51.240 --> 33:52.407
One can only assume

33:52.440 --> 33:54.176
that they're already dead.

33:57.512 --> 34:00.182
Can we just get
back to this or?

34:00.216 --> 34:01.884
We're sorry, go
ahead, go ahead.

34:06.255 --> 34:08.057
Go ahead, please.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.159
Okay, okay.

34:14.297 --> 34:17.599
Any personal or
valued belongings

34:17.632 --> 34:20.502
shall be relinquished
at this time.

34:20.535 --> 34:23.940
Wallets, cell phones,
watches and other possessions

34:23.973 --> 34:26.943
or I will remove
them from your person

34:26.976 --> 34:29.345
and hold them against your will.

34:29.378 --> 34:31.680
Okay, okay, we'll
play by your rules.

34:33.782 --> 34:35.918
This is already too stupid.

34:35.952 --> 34:38.020
You have the right
to remain silent

34:38.054 --> 34:39.621
and I suggest you use it.

34:40.722 --> 34:42.124
Anything you say

34:42.158 --> 34:45.161
can and will be held against
you in a court of law.

34:46.628 --> 34:51.499
And God help the sick son of
a bitch who's found guilty.

34:52.935 --> 34:57.306
There is a special place
in hell for child abusers.

34:57.340 --> 35:00.508
Officer, lead them
to the line up.

35:00.542 --> 35:02.078
Let's
move it out, people.

35:08.317 --> 35:10.152
Good job, Becky.

35:10.186 --> 35:11.120
That one felt good.

35:13.422 --> 35:14.991
Getting better every day.

35:29.205 --> 35:30.805
Line it up.

35:30.839 --> 35:31.673
Bit pushy.

35:33.708 --> 35:36.345
You are so sleek.

35:37.346 --> 35:38.247
Thank you.

35:38.280 --> 35:39.482
Do not speak to other guests.

35:40.416 --> 35:45.354
That's right, sorry, yes, sir.

35:46.688 --> 35:50.092
Sit tight, the lead
detective is en route.

36:06.442 --> 36:07.776
No phones.

36:07.809 --> 36:09.078
Suck a dick.

36:11.613 --> 36:12.547
Watch it.

36:13.681 --> 36:14.950
Roger that, captain.

36:20.389 --> 36:21.390
Tough guy.

36:28.130 --> 36:31.000
Hey, you look very beautiful.

36:32.134 --> 36:34.803
You hey, you remind
me of my mother.

36:37.106 --> 36:39.909
Oh you got jungle fever, huh?

36:39.942 --> 36:40.742
Are you kidding me?

36:40.775 --> 36:41.877
Quiet.

36:41.911 --> 36:43.479
Seriously?

36:43.512 --> 36:45.414
Hey, no worries, brother.

36:45.448 --> 36:47.116
Hey, not worth it.

36:49.385 --> 36:50.186
Seriously?

36:55.458 --> 36:56.292
The detective.

37:09.838 --> 37:10.940
How you all doing?

37:10.973 --> 37:12.208
Great, we're pumped.

37:12.241 --> 37:13.075
Right guys?

37:16.912 --> 37:19.248
Given the unique circumstances

37:19.281 --> 37:22.451
surrounding the disappearance
of these young ladies,

37:22.485 --> 37:24.286
we're gonna be conducting
this investigation

37:24.320 --> 37:26.122
in a slightly unorthodox way.

37:30.593 --> 37:32.027
Sign and pass it down.

37:40.635 --> 37:41.636
Apparently this guy had a job

37:41.669 --> 37:43.771
at like a real insane asylum.

37:43.805 --> 37:47.209
Now he runs this place,
ain't that so cool?

37:47.243 --> 37:48.344
My name is Sam.

37:49.677 --> 37:51.013
This is my partner Tabitha.

37:52.414 --> 37:53.482
We have a piece of evidence

37:53.516 --> 37:55.351
that leads us to believe

37:55.384 --> 37:58.354
that one of you knows the
whereabouts of these young girls.

37:59.654 --> 38:02.291
And we have the authority
to hold you here

38:03.159 --> 38:04.792
until either they're home safely

38:06.428 --> 38:07.930
or their bodies are uncovered.

38:10.299 --> 38:13.569
Please fill out the personal
information accordingly.

38:13.602 --> 38:15.703
It's a standard
release form, just sign.

38:21.043 --> 38:23.045
But first thing's
first, welcome.

38:30.785 --> 38:31.620
Mmm God.

38:33.055 --> 38:34.089
Seriously?

38:38.227 --> 38:39.794
Now we know that
only one of you

38:39.827 --> 38:41.163
is guilty of this crime.

38:44.433 --> 38:46.235
But none of you are
innocent really.

38:50.039 --> 38:53.609
The best justice is revenge.

38:55.377 --> 38:58.447
We're gonna be watching
you all very closely.

38:58.480 --> 39:01.150
If any of you exhibit
any kind of guilt,

39:02.451 --> 39:04.119
you will be dealt
with accordingly.

39:06.622 --> 39:07.523
This one's nice.

39:09.258 --> 39:11.126
I think I'd like to
strip search him.

39:16.365 --> 39:17.633
Hey I got an idea,

39:19.168 --> 39:21.803
why don't we all head down
to the interrogation room?

39:24.673 --> 39:25.507
Shall we?

39:26.442 --> 39:27.543
Off you go.

39:30.446 --> 39:31.947
File out!

40:02.177 --> 40:04.046
Just take the compliment.

40:20.396 --> 40:21.897
This is awesome.

40:31.873 --> 40:35.544
The little girls were
last seen trick or treating

40:35.577 --> 40:36.945
just before sundown.

40:38.647 --> 40:41.816
We think that someone
coaxed them off that path

40:45.487 --> 40:47.656
and we think that
someone's in this room.

40:52.728 --> 40:54.396
Huh?

40:56.231 --> 40:58.033
You could save us all a
lot of time and trouble

40:58.067 --> 40:59.134
if you'd just confess.

41:00.102 --> 41:01.869
Confess, it was you.

41:01.904 --> 41:03.172
You think this is a joke?

41:04.707 --> 41:08.577
Believe me, by the
end of this night,

41:08.610 --> 41:11.480
one of you is gonna
be begging to confess.

41:25.928 --> 41:30.432
All right, all right,
we'll do it the hard way.

41:37.473 --> 41:39.041
Good luck, chickies.

41:39.074 --> 41:41.009
The only way out is
to escape the room.

41:48.884 --> 41:50.452
You've got one hour.

42:09.638 --> 42:10.973
I got something.

42:11.006 --> 42:13.509
It's dated 10/31/95.

42:13.542 --> 42:15.911
It says, "Witness reports
seeing two young girls

42:15.944 --> 42:17.146
"roughly eight years of age

42:17.179 --> 42:20.849
"walking west of Shasta
Drive at 5:45 p.m."

42:20.884 --> 42:22.618
It says, "Saw the girls
get into a white truck

42:22.651 --> 42:26.021
"and drive off with someone
that they "seemed to know"."

42:26.054 --> 42:31.059
8545, 8545, 8545, 8545.

42:32.494 --> 42:33.929
You okay, Rainman?

42:33.962 --> 42:36.832
The numbers, everything's
got to be a clue, right?

42:36.865 --> 42:38.400
So I'm just keeping track.

42:38.434 --> 42:39.701
Look who showed up today.

42:39.735 --> 42:40.836
I like that.

42:40.869 --> 42:42.304
Okay, this is the end of it,

42:42.337 --> 42:44.139
"The truck was registered
to an Aaron Thacker."

42:44.173 --> 42:45.841
Says, "He came in
for questioning,

42:45.874 --> 42:47.743
"we recorded his
statement and released him

42:47.776 --> 42:49.278
"as his story checked out."

42:50.880 --> 42:52.114
Tape recording.

42:52.147 --> 42:53.115
All right, let's
divide and conquer.

42:53.148 --> 42:54.049
I got the safe.

42:54.082 --> 42:55.017
Oh, try 8545.

42:57.052 --> 43:00.222
Guys, this desk, it's locked.

43:01.156 --> 43:02.658
It was totally normal.

43:02.691 --> 43:04.159
I know Megan and Ellen.

43:04.193 --> 43:05.761
Sometimes my mom
makes me watch them

43:05.794 --> 43:07.563
when she and Mrs.
Mayer drink wine.

43:07.596 --> 43:11.433
Ellen was crying because
she lost her necklace,

43:11.467 --> 43:13.302
this little silver E.

43:13.335 --> 43:14.803
She was really upset.

43:14.837 --> 43:17.172
I just gave them a ride
back to the neighborhood.

43:17.206 --> 43:18.307
They got into my car

43:18.340 --> 43:19.608
and headed back to their house

43:19.641 --> 43:21.210
and haven't seen them since.

43:21.243 --> 43:22.711
It was weird,

43:22.744 --> 43:24.580
I don't remember seeing
them go into their house.

43:26.782 --> 43:27.983
My mom came out of the house

43:28.016 --> 43:29.785
to tell me to bring the cans in.

43:29.818 --> 43:32.221
She distracted me only for
a second, not that long.

43:32.254 --> 43:34.223
Like not long
enough for the girls

43:34.256 --> 43:36.024
to have crossed the street even.

43:36.058 --> 43:38.160
When I turned back,
they were gone.

43:38.193 --> 43:39.862
I did find Ellen's
necklace though,

43:39.896 --> 43:43.065
maybe it fell off her costume
in my car, I don't know,

43:43.098 --> 43:45.167
but you can have it if you want.

43:46.034 --> 43:48.337
Yo, found-o le-necklace-o.

43:50.539 --> 43:51.773
Bring it over here.

43:51.807 --> 43:54.810
There's a carving under
this drawer, it's an E.

44:06.822 --> 44:07.991
There's nothing in this book,

44:08.023 --> 44:10.158
just normal kids stuff,

44:11.260 --> 44:15.364
colored pages,
mostly in the lines.

44:15.397 --> 44:17.000
What are you, some art critic?

44:18.133 --> 44:19.768
Oh, got it.

44:19.801 --> 44:20.970
Making moves.

44:28.076 --> 44:32.114
Shouldn't we be
looking for fluids?

44:32.147 --> 44:33.181
Knock that off.

44:34.149 --> 44:35.317
Whoopsy daisy.

44:37.419 --> 44:38.253
Woo.

44:39.488 --> 44:40.489
There we go.

44:42.025 --> 44:43.026
There we go.

44:47.596 --> 44:48.430
Check it out.

44:50.399 --> 44:52.601
Anybody hear me?

44:52.634 --> 44:53.802
Hello?

44:53.835 --> 44:56.071
- Help me.
- Shut up, dad, dad!

44:56.104 --> 44:59.808
Francis, come on, just,
daddy's having a little fun.

45:06.548 --> 45:09.886
This is cute
and all but yeah...

45:09.919 --> 45:11.820
What would you do without me?

45:11.853 --> 45:12.688
Look.

45:19.528 --> 45:23.865
Yep, there it is, X1
fire extinguisher.

45:23.900 --> 45:24.934
It's too ash tray.

45:26.134 --> 45:28.170
This does look
oddly out of place.

45:34.776 --> 45:37.080
There's grooves in the top.

45:37.112 --> 45:38.780
Ty, hand me that chair.

45:42.851 --> 45:44.586
Hand me the ash tray.

45:52.427 --> 45:54.097
Dum dadumdum.

45:55.965 --> 45:58.001
Just open the damn door.

45:59.668 --> 46:02.170
Okay, whatever
makes you happy chief.

46:06.876 --> 46:09.811
Looks like we got a new
situation on our hand out here.

46:10.913 --> 46:12.381
No fucking way.

46:14.650 --> 46:15.484
Let me see that.

46:16.585 --> 46:17.419
Thank you, sir.

46:19.321 --> 46:20.222
Holy shit.

46:28.563 --> 46:31.833
- Dad?
- Babe?

46:33.036 --> 46:34.803
It's not over yet.

46:34.836 --> 46:37.572
- Dad?
- What?

46:39.241 --> 46:40.676
Whoa?

46:43.146 --> 46:45.447
Bitch, this door is locked.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.282
Keith, just use the key.

46:48.250 --> 46:49.451
I took it.

46:49.484 --> 46:51.853
I'm so sorry, I took
it as a souvenir.

46:51.888 --> 46:52.955
Open it up!

46:54.690 --> 46:57.960
Guys, we are wasting time.

46:57.994 --> 46:59.294
Maintenance will take
care of these guys,

46:59.327 --> 47:00.897
we need to just get moving.

47:00.930 --> 47:03.365
Help us, help us!

47:03.398 --> 47:05.034
Are you guys okay?

47:06.435 --> 47:07.836
It doesn't fit.

47:08.704 --> 47:10.772
The key won't work on this side.

47:10.806 --> 47:13.508
This is fucking impossible.

47:13.542 --> 47:14.409
Guys, do you not get it?

47:14.443 --> 47:15.277
It's part of it.

47:16.179 --> 47:17.345
It's part of it.

47:17.379 --> 47:18.814
What?

47:18.847 --> 47:20.782
Yes, obviously if there's
something really wrong,

47:20.816 --> 47:22.451
they'd shut the room down.

47:22.484 --> 47:23.752
That's a valid point.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.123
You seem to know an awful lot

47:27.156 --> 47:28.356
about what's going on.

47:28.390 --> 47:30.459
It's because I've
seen this before.

47:30.492 --> 47:31.727
They use a couple moles

47:31.760 --> 47:33.295
to throw you off the
trail and waste time

47:33.328 --> 47:35.731
and that's what we're
doing, we're wasting time.

47:39.001 --> 47:42.637
And this place just
does not quit, let's go.

48:08.764 --> 48:10.866
Nancy
Drew's in her element.

48:25.547 --> 48:28.450
This is my nightmare, Tyler.

48:28.483 --> 48:29.317
It's campy.

48:30.352 --> 48:31.921
Hey, what's your play, huh?

48:31.954 --> 48:32.889
What are you talking about?

48:43.900 --> 48:44.800
Found it.

49:26.775 --> 49:27.776
Oh my God.

49:31.881 --> 49:34.116
Are y'all seeing this shit?

49:36.252 --> 49:38.720
Oh my God, this is amazing.

49:52.868 --> 49:56.638
Um, uh, mhmm.

50:00.375 --> 50:04.280
Okay man, you're the
escape room expert,

50:04.313 --> 50:05.915
get me out of here.

50:05.948 --> 50:06.781
Right.

50:08.516 --> 50:10.119
Well
I found something.

50:10.152 --> 50:10.987
Okay.

50:11.921 --> 50:15.024
"Means, motive
and opportunity.

50:15.057 --> 50:17.126
"My client, though presented
with the opportunity

50:17.159 --> 50:19.661
"had neither the
means nor the motive

50:19.694 --> 50:23.332
"to have perpetrated the
murder of this little girl."

50:23.366 --> 50:24.934
They found the little girl.

50:24.967 --> 50:26.801
Wait, I thought it
was two little girls.

50:26.835 --> 50:28.237
Good point.

50:28.271 --> 50:30.106
Is that a clue?

50:30.139 --> 50:31.374
It's got to be a clue, right?

50:31.406 --> 50:32.909
Well there's more.

50:32.942 --> 50:35.144
"Based on the
injuries sustained,

50:35.177 --> 50:38.513
"our client was in fact a
victim of the same crime.

50:39.547 --> 50:42.018
"I present Exhibit A."

50:42.051 --> 50:45.321
Aha, Exhibit A.

50:46.688 --> 50:51.294
"Defensive wounds,
bruises five inch diameter."

50:51.327 --> 50:53.262
That's a big bruise.

50:53.296 --> 50:54.629
"The prosecution suggests

50:54.663 --> 50:56.232
"the bruising on
the client's arms

50:56.265 --> 50:59.634
"were defensive wounds
inflicted by her victim.

50:59.668 --> 51:01.569
"My client's baby
sister clinging to her

51:01.603 --> 51:03.306
"pleading for her life.

51:03.339 --> 51:05.840
"What child has palms that big?"

51:09.178 --> 51:12.747
Jesus Christ, the
little girl did it?

51:13.682 --> 51:15.084
No, weren't you listening?

51:15.117 --> 51:18.321
They were saying the defendant
was wrongfully accused.

51:18.354 --> 51:19.155
Oh.

51:19.188 --> 51:20.089
But what's the clue?

51:21.290 --> 51:23.893
What do we do with
this information?

51:24.060 --> 51:25.560
Guilty!

51:25.593 --> 51:27.129
I fucking hate this place.

51:30.498 --> 51:31.367
Ang, you all right?

51:31.400 --> 51:32.467
Something just touched me.

51:33.468 --> 51:34.736
Exhibit B.

51:36.638 --> 51:39.375
Oh hey, I think
Exhibit B is the VHS player.

51:39.408 --> 51:40.775
There's a tape player here.

51:43.545 --> 51:44.846
Is there a tape?

51:57.159 --> 51:58.593
Fuck, Chris.

51:59.929 --> 52:01.030
This is part of it.

52:01.063 --> 52:01.998
It's gotta be part of it.

52:02.031 --> 52:03.899
This guy's got no pulse.

52:03.933 --> 52:04.766
What?

52:05.901 --> 52:07.069
Ang, Angela?

52:08.536 --> 52:10.306
Brittany, Brittany!

52:12.375 --> 52:14.410
I feel like I'm
losing my mind, Tyler.

52:14.443 --> 52:15.277
Brittany!

52:16.212 --> 52:17.246
This shit is crazy.

52:18.247 --> 52:20.249
There are no monsters here.

52:27.056 --> 52:30.226
Monsters are not real, remember?

52:32.061 --> 52:34.796
Your screaming won't help
you find Angela and Brittany.

52:35.663 --> 52:37.433
The doors have been opened.

52:38.300 --> 52:39.502
That's enough of a clue.

52:41.003 --> 52:42.637
Don't be so stupid.

52:44.806 --> 52:49.811
You know what to do.

52:51.914 --> 52:53.382
Where you going?

52:54.383 --> 52:55.951
I'm getting out of here.

53:31.020 --> 53:32.221
I see what's going on.

53:34.190 --> 53:35.524
What are you talking about?

53:36.658 --> 53:38.626
It's a little too
familiar, Tyler.

53:39.794 --> 53:40.563
Matt,
you're scaring me.

53:40.595 --> 53:41.530
Oh I'm scaring you?

54:09.724 --> 54:11.060
What are you doing?

54:16.899 --> 54:17.732
Surviving.

54:25.608 --> 54:27.910
We love your fighting
spirit, Matthew Blake,

54:29.677 --> 54:30.880
but I'm sure soon,

54:32.081 --> 54:34.150
you'll find that you're
powerless in this game.

54:36.085 --> 54:40.556
Relax, your lives are
in very capable hands.

54:41.823 --> 54:42.790
Angela?

54:48.430 --> 54:50.199
Sorry about that.

54:52.601 --> 54:55.171
But don't worry, your
time's almost up, Matthew.

54:58.140 --> 55:00.708
I think you know how this
story ends, do you not?

55:03.345 --> 55:04.779
Perhaps the way out

55:07.149 --> 55:08.117
is also the way in.

55:12.354 --> 55:14.089
Are you ready to
pay for your sins?

55:21.263 --> 55:22.498
This is real?

55:25.733 --> 55:26.569
Surprise.

55:29.471 --> 55:30.973
You did this?

55:31.006 --> 55:33.309
Don't be stupid, I just
accused you of doing this.

55:34.376 --> 55:35.277
Where's Ang...

56:46.248 --> 56:47.316
You got me.

56:48.850 --> 56:49.752
You got me.

56:50.719 --> 56:51.587
I give up.

56:54.356 --> 56:56.191
Matthew Blake gives up.

57:02.331 --> 57:03.098
Fuck!

57:22.918 --> 57:24.353
Who are you, huh?

57:26.555 --> 57:27.389
Who are you?

57:31.660 --> 57:33.595
How do I know you, huh?

57:50.212 --> 57:51.880
Are you a sad dad?

58:28.250 --> 58:29.485
Hi Alice.

58:31.053 --> 58:32.354
Did you miss me, sweetie?

58:33.555 --> 58:36.592
Ooh, stinks in here.

58:36.625 --> 58:37.760
Did you do a wee wee?

58:42.197 --> 58:44.299
Help, help, help, help!

58:45.434 --> 58:47.436
Help, somebody!

58:47.469 --> 58:49.605
Hey, you want me
to put this back on?

58:50.806 --> 58:52.374
'Cause I really didn't
want to do that today.

58:52.408 --> 58:56.712
I was hoping to get
some nice kisses, no?

58:58.947 --> 59:01.984
Please, my family has money.

59:03.018 --> 59:04.286
They'll pay you.

59:04.319 --> 59:05.921
They can pay you.

59:06.789 --> 59:08.357
No one will ever know.

59:09.525 --> 59:14.496
Hey, well I don't
want money or need it.

59:15.230 --> 59:16.398
But I tell you what

59:16.432 --> 59:19.168
if you give me one
last little soft kiss,

59:20.502 --> 59:21.970
then I'll kill you quickly.

59:22.871 --> 59:23.705
What?

59:25.307 --> 59:27.209
Why are you doing this?

59:32.882 --> 59:33.715
Fuck you.

59:45.294 --> 59:48.797
Suit yourself.

1:00:01.643 --> 1:00:04.079
Do you miss your precious
little whore daughter?

1:00:06.615 --> 1:00:08.217
'Cause that's what she was.

1:00:09.551 --> 1:00:11.153
I can assure you that.

1:00:19.394 --> 1:00:21.096
Or maybe you're a
jealous husband.

1:00:44.319 --> 1:00:45.287
Please no.

1:00:48.490 --> 1:00:50.425
Please stop it.

1:00:50.459 --> 1:00:51.928
Please, please no.

1:00:52.996 --> 1:00:55.430
No, what do you want from me?

1:00:55.464 --> 1:00:57.599
I'll do anything, please.

1:00:57.633 --> 1:01:02.037
Ah, ah, ah,
,

1:01:02.070 --> 1:01:04.139
she just wants to go home.

1:01:06.642 --> 1:01:09.012
Please, what do you want?

1:01:09.044 --> 1:01:09.879
Please?

1:01:11.780 --> 1:01:14.816
Well maybe you shouldn't
cheat on your husband

1:01:14.850 --> 1:01:16.351
with random guys.

1:01:16.385 --> 1:01:18.353
I won't and I'm sorry.

1:01:18.387 --> 1:01:20.957
I won't again, I swear I won't.

1:01:20.990 --> 1:01:21.823
You won't?

1:01:21.857 --> 1:01:22.691
You won't?

1:01:22.724 --> 1:01:23.525
No, I won't.

1:01:23.559 --> 1:01:25.060
You promise?

1:01:25.093 --> 1:01:28.196
And let me guess, you won't
say anything about me, right?

1:01:28.230 --> 1:01:31.733
No, I swear, I
swear to God I won't.

1:01:31.767 --> 1:01:34.536
I swear, please,
please, I swear.

1:01:37.205 --> 1:01:40.877
Hey, hey, you know
I'm just kidding right?

1:01:44.146 --> 1:01:46.348
No, no, no, no,
no, no, I won't say,

1:01:46.381 --> 1:01:47.616
I won't say anything.

1:01:47.649 --> 1:01:50.053
Please, I won't,
I won't, I swear.

1:01:52.754 --> 1:01:53.923
Please, I swear.

1:01:53.957 --> 1:01:57.159
I won't tell anybody,
I swear, please.

1:01:57.192 --> 1:01:59.628
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, I'm just kidding.

1:01:59.661 --> 1:02:00.796
I'm just kidding.

1:02:00.829 --> 1:02:02.664
Okay please.

1:02:02.698 --> 1:02:04.433
Please I swear.

1:02:04.466 --> 1:02:07.402
I'm just kidding.

1:02:07.436 --> 1:02:09.338
This was gonna
happen either way.

1:02:09.371 --> 1:02:11.908
No, no, no, no, no, please!

1:02:20.716 --> 1:02:23.485
In which case you
should be thanking me

1:02:25.587 --> 1:02:30.592
for saving you from a lifetime
of bitching and nagging

1:02:31.326 --> 1:02:33.328
and pissing and moaning.

1:02:38.634 --> 1:02:40.135
Fucking answer me!

1:02:51.948 --> 1:02:53.916
You thought you
could fuck with me.

1:02:53.950 --> 1:02:55.350
You thought you
could fuck with me.

1:03:31.219 --> 1:03:32.220
Oh my God.

1:03:35.124 --> 1:03:36.792
I took care of it.

1:03:38.593 --> 1:03:40.529
Still don't believe me?

1:03:43.331 --> 1:03:46.835
Brittany, I never
should've doubted you.

1:04:00.348 --> 1:04:01.150
Fuck.

1:04:04.921 --> 1:04:06.788
You've done it again.

1:04:06.822 --> 1:04:08.757
Too bad the only survivor

1:04:08.790 --> 1:04:11.426
is also your only friend

1:04:11.460 --> 1:04:15.297
in sickness and health,
till death do you part.

1:04:15.330 --> 1:04:19.135
What oath has lasted longer,
the tongue or the heart?

1:04:19.168 --> 1:04:22.237
There can be no secrets
if somebody knows.

1:04:22.270 --> 1:04:26.142
It's your choice now
who lives and who goes.

1:04:30.012 --> 1:04:31.446
Till death due us part.

1:04:33.916 --> 1:04:37.285
Angela, she may still be alive.

1:04:37.319 --> 1:04:38.386
No.

1:04:39.254 --> 1:04:40.522
What?

1:04:43.725 --> 1:04:44.760
She's dead.

1:04:49.765 --> 1:04:50.665
You heard the man,

1:04:51.833 --> 1:04:55.004
it's my choice now who
lives and who dies.

1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:01.843
Matt, think about
what you're saying.

1:05:03.045 --> 1:05:04.513
Oh I'm thinking.

1:05:06.015 --> 1:05:09.018
I'm thinking that there's no
need for you to keep my secrets

1:05:10.186 --> 1:05:11.154
if you're dead.

1:05:12.721 --> 1:05:14.223
We're brothers, you and me.

1:05:15.357 --> 1:05:17.793
We can fight our
way out of here.

1:05:17.826 --> 1:05:20.062
It's a team, we
make a good team.

1:05:21.830 --> 1:05:23.132
Please, we're brothers.

1:05:23.166 --> 1:05:25.001
I paid for your
silence for years.

1:05:25.867 --> 1:05:28.637
What, that wasn't enough?

1:05:30.006 --> 1:05:31.540
I never said a word.

1:05:32.507 --> 1:05:33.708
And I never will.

1:05:33.742 --> 1:05:34.810
Then how'd it
get to this point?

1:05:36.444 --> 1:05:38.014
I know I never talked.

1:05:39.882 --> 1:05:42.717
So go ahead, Ty, lie to my face.

1:05:42.751 --> 1:05:45.654
Tell me one more time that
you never told a soul.

1:05:50.525 --> 1:05:51.359
Never.

1:05:53.996 --> 1:05:54.830
Right.

1:05:58.400 --> 1:06:00.303
So you got greedy, huh?

1:06:03.338 --> 1:06:06.508
What'd you do look up
some grieving father,

1:06:06.541 --> 1:06:07.910
some pissed off husband?

1:06:10.012 --> 1:06:12.747
They give you more
money to bring me down

1:06:12.781 --> 1:06:14.783
or did you finally
grow a pair of balls?

1:06:16.085 --> 1:06:18.120
I'm not like that.

1:06:18.154 --> 1:06:18.955
I'm not a monster.

1:06:18.988 --> 1:06:20.089
Oh come on, Tyler.

1:06:21.590 --> 1:06:23.259
I just have to know.

1:06:25.161 --> 1:06:28.663
You seemed content
for the last 17 years

1:06:28.697 --> 1:06:30.333
me taking care of you.

1:06:30.365 --> 1:06:31.433
What changed that?

1:06:33.668 --> 1:06:34.769
I never said a word.

1:06:37.139 --> 1:06:40.142
I'm your brother,
thicker than blood.

1:06:42.144 --> 1:06:47.149
Oh Tyler, it suited you.

1:06:47.984 --> 1:06:49.718
You made that choice.

1:06:52.088 --> 1:06:55.258
You're right, I
did make that choice

1:06:56.926 --> 1:06:58.393
to not say shit.

1:06:59.594 --> 1:07:02.098
Maybe if I had, we
wouldn't be here.

1:07:13.876 --> 1:07:15.978
Maybe it's not your choice.

1:07:29.591 --> 1:07:33.695
There can be no
secrets if someone knows.

1:07:36.531 --> 1:07:37.366
Matthew.

1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:40.236
How?

1:07:40.269 --> 1:07:41.103
Tyler.

1:07:42.737 --> 1:07:44.806
They came in and injected him.

1:07:44.839 --> 1:07:46.142
I was just waiting for
them to come back for him

1:07:46.175 --> 1:07:46.943
and get me.

1:07:46.976 --> 1:07:47.809
How terrible.

1:07:49.078 --> 1:07:51.247
Yeah, we're
gonna get out of here.

1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:52.647
Aren't you tired, Mattie?

1:07:54.083 --> 1:07:55.650
What are
you talking about?

1:07:57.086 --> 1:07:58.486
Brittany, you're scaring me.

1:08:01.756 --> 1:08:04.226
Matthew, I'm scaring you?

1:08:05.261 --> 1:08:06.695
What are you talking about?

1:08:08.064 --> 1:08:10.066
I can't believe you
don't remember me.

1:08:11.033 --> 1:08:12.335
I could never forget you.

1:08:13.436 --> 1:08:15.338
What's happening?

1:08:15.371 --> 1:08:18.807
Aren't you tired, Matthew?

1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:19.641
Stop!

1:08:20.508 --> 1:08:21.810
What are you talking about?

1:08:21.843 --> 1:08:22.844
Well I'm tired.

1:08:23.778 --> 1:08:25.714
I'm tired of pretending.

1:08:25.747 --> 1:08:27.083
Stop!

1:08:27.116 --> 1:08:28.951
Stop talking in riddles!

1:08:30.485 --> 1:08:32.821
I'm worried about you, babe.

1:08:35.391 --> 1:08:38.827
Honestly, I can't believe
you don't recognize me.

1:08:40.296 --> 1:08:41.763
At the beginning,

1:08:41.796 --> 1:08:43.399
I thought for sure you'd
be able to place my face.

1:08:44.833 --> 1:08:45.834
That was naive.

1:08:50.772 --> 1:08:53.876
I watched you from
afar for a long time.

1:08:57.512 --> 1:08:58.680
I studied you,

1:09:00.249 --> 1:09:01.317
analyzed you.

1:09:04.686 --> 1:09:06.688
At first, I thought
maybe you'd changed,

1:09:08.190 --> 1:09:10.926
maybe you were just
a troubled child,

1:09:12.428 --> 1:09:13.963
maybe you had problems at home.

1:09:15.331 --> 1:09:16.531
I didn't know then.

1:09:17.766 --> 1:09:19.969
I was just a kid then

1:09:24.140 --> 1:09:26.208
I told everyone what I saw

1:09:26.242 --> 1:09:29.245
and I waited for you
to come kill my family.

1:09:32.081 --> 1:09:34.183
But you didn't need to
make good on that threat.

1:09:37.619 --> 1:09:38.954
Mommy.

1:09:38.988 --> 1:09:39.821
No.

1:09:41.357 --> 1:09:42.191
No.

1:09:45.593 --> 1:09:48.097
We have to take her
away ma'am, I'm sorry.

1:09:48.130 --> 1:09:49.198
What?

1:09:49.231 --> 1:09:50.066
What?

1:09:50.099 --> 1:09:51.599
She did do this.

1:09:51.633 --> 1:09:54.070
Mommy, daddy, the monster
did it, the monster did it.

1:09:54.103 --> 1:09:56.405
Mommy, daddy, the
monster did it.

1:09:56.439 --> 1:09:58.340
Please, the monster did it.

1:09:58.374 --> 1:10:00.443
Please, the monster did it.

1:10:00.476 --> 1:10:01.810
Why aren't you listening to me?

1:10:08.583 --> 1:10:10.585
No one ever believed me.

1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:22.098
Bet you feel crazy huh,
'cause no one believes you?

1:10:23.865 --> 1:10:25.134
And I still lost them.

1:10:27.602 --> 1:10:29.771
Why won't they believe me?

1:10:35.244 --> 1:10:37.379
Do you remember me now?

1:10:42.218 --> 1:10:43.018
Emily.

1:10:50.292 --> 1:10:51.693
I have to admit

1:10:53.596 --> 1:10:56.332
I was a bit peeved at first

1:10:56.365 --> 1:10:57.866
at how oblivious you were.

1:10:59.767 --> 1:11:01.003
As I stayed near,

1:11:01.036 --> 1:11:02.770
I kept replaying
our last encounter

1:11:02.804 --> 1:11:05.773
over and over in my head.

1:11:08.043 --> 1:11:09.111
Ah, it's here.

1:11:09.145 --> 1:11:11.247
Please help, the monster's back.

1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:15.650
Please help, it's here,
the monster is back.

1:11:15.683 --> 1:11:18.354
I'm not just some
guy who stops by once.

1:11:20.489 --> 1:11:25.027
I was elated to hear
your conviction.

1:11:27.263 --> 1:11:29.031
I had to come pay my respects.

1:11:32.867 --> 1:11:34.003
You understand?

1:11:35.371 --> 1:11:36.338
Entirely.

1:11:40.876 --> 1:11:43.646
So how did you
pull all this off?

1:11:45.114 --> 1:11:45.948
Well...

1:11:48.450 --> 1:11:49.952
No one believed me

1:11:49.985 --> 1:11:53.322
when I told them a monster
had murdered my sister.

1:11:54.223 --> 1:11:56.258
They thought I heard voices,

1:11:56.292 --> 1:11:58.194
that the voices made me do it.

1:12:01.763 --> 1:12:03.666
You know, silver lining,

1:12:04.866 --> 1:12:07.636
I made a lot of
friends in there.

1:12:08.803 --> 1:12:13.008
It's funny how excited
a bunch of lunatics get

1:12:13.042 --> 1:12:14.809
when you pitch them
a revenge plot.

1:12:18.614 --> 1:12:19.448
My God.

1:12:21.816 --> 1:12:23.085
Mom, why won't
anyone believe me?

1:12:23.118 --> 1:12:25.120
Stop it wasn't me, stop!

1:12:26.255 --> 1:12:27.189
Stop!

1:12:27.223 --> 1:12:29.857
Stop, it wasn't me, stop!

1:12:29.892 --> 1:12:31.826
Why won't anyone believe me?

1:12:31.859 --> 1:12:32.695
Stop!

1:12:33.761 --> 1:12:35.763
Please, stop, let me go!

1:12:37.333 --> 1:12:39.335
Stop, let me go, please.

1:12:41.036 --> 1:12:43.138
Please, let me go!

1:12:43.172 --> 1:12:44.872
Please stop!

1:12:44.907 --> 1:12:47.243
Please, help me, let me out!

1:13:02.124 --> 1:13:04.660
There are
no monsters here.

1:13:07.296 --> 1:13:09.131
Monsters are not real.

1:13:11.267 --> 1:13:12.701
And if they were,

1:13:14.836 --> 1:13:16.238
we can beat them.

1:13:46.135 --> 1:13:48.237
Emily, Emily, Emily no.

1:13:50.239 --> 1:13:53.575
Emily no, I'll see
you soon, I love you.

1:13:54.443 --> 1:13:56.844
Tell me when you're ready.

1:13:56.879 --> 1:14:00.883
Emily, I'll
see you soon, I love you.

1:14:07.690 --> 1:14:12.695
Hey crazy, here's all the
info on your blind date,

1:14:13.762 --> 1:14:15.631
DMV records, pictures,
fingerprints,

1:14:15.664 --> 1:14:16.932
everything you asked for.

1:14:17.865 --> 1:14:19.068
Merry fucking Christmas.

1:14:21.070 --> 1:14:22.271
When I got out,

1:14:22.304 --> 1:14:23.639
the first thing I
did was look you up.

1:14:24.573 --> 1:14:26.709
I had you followed.

1:14:26.742 --> 1:14:29.878
You looked different after
all the surgeries you had.

1:14:29.912 --> 1:14:33.382
You were just as cute
as you were that day.

1:14:34.650 --> 1:14:37.453
The day on the
skateboard, you remember.

1:14:38.853 --> 1:14:41.256
Oh I saw the fun you
had over the years,

1:14:42.958 --> 1:14:44.259
all those missing girls.

1:14:45.860 --> 1:14:48.564
Yep, all there.

1:14:56.071 --> 1:14:58.307
If you want my opinion,

1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:00.109
one psycho to another,

1:15:02.878 --> 1:15:05.013
you're letting your
pride make you sloppy.

1:15:08.183 --> 1:15:09.618
I was only watching
you for a week

1:15:09.651 --> 1:15:14.256
before I noticed your
tendencies had progressed.

1:15:15.124 --> 1:15:17.059
So why not just call the cops?

1:15:18.827 --> 1:15:22.197
Matthew, you and I both know

1:15:23.165 --> 1:15:27.002
police are ineffective at best.

1:15:29.872 --> 1:15:33.108
So what's your
end game, Emily?

1:15:33.142 --> 1:15:34.777
Emily's dead.

1:15:38.147 --> 1:15:39.848
You're not even mad, are you?

1:15:39.883 --> 1:15:40.716
Mad?

1:15:41.885 --> 1:15:43.786
I'm inspired.

1:15:46.555 --> 1:15:47.790
When I first met you,

1:15:47.823 --> 1:15:49.825
I thought you'd be
the perfect victim,

1:15:49.858 --> 1:15:52.060
no family, no records,

1:15:52.094 --> 1:15:53.262
hell I thought
you were a runaway

1:15:53.295 --> 1:15:55.364
with no one to come
looking for you.

1:15:55.397 --> 1:15:56.799
Then why not kill me?

1:15:58.033 --> 1:16:02.337
Simply, it's nice to
have a built-in alibi.

1:16:08.610 --> 1:16:12.247
I couldn't have dreamed up a
more perfect woman than you.

1:16:17.419 --> 1:16:18.253
I created you.

1:16:22.591 --> 1:16:23.425
I love you.

1:16:28.898 --> 1:16:31.633
Thanks but I
already met someone.

1:16:33.502 --> 1:16:34.503
Hey buddy.

1:16:36.472 --> 1:16:37.306
You?

1:16:39.909 --> 1:16:43.212
I want you to meet my
new girlfriend, Brittany.

1:16:44.646 --> 1:16:48.217
She got in touch with
me about four years ago.

1:16:48.250 --> 1:16:50.185
After I realized how
close you two had remained

1:16:50.219 --> 1:16:52.254
I found it fitting
to get in touch.

1:16:52.287 --> 1:16:56.124
Now that's the cute
version of the story.

1:16:56.158 --> 1:16:59.896
We had a little chat and
we quickly bonded over you.

1:17:00.829 --> 1:17:02.364
Thanks for that, buddy.

1:17:02.397 --> 1:17:03.933
Brittany really is a great girl.

1:17:05.133 --> 1:17:06.936
This punk bitch?

1:17:06.970 --> 1:17:08.203
What's the matter, bro?

1:17:09.538 --> 1:17:11.006
I thought you liked
sharing my women.

1:17:22.584 --> 1:17:24.219
On the ground!

1:17:24.253 --> 1:17:25.754
On the ground!

1:17:25.787 --> 1:17:27.289
I will drop you!

1:17:28.624 --> 1:17:30.526
He killed our friend.

1:17:31.593 --> 1:17:32.427
I'm sorry.

1:17:35.230 --> 1:17:37.967
He's crazy, he
killed our friend.

1:17:42.304 --> 1:17:46.408
They were our first
non-test group into the rooms.

1:17:48.310 --> 1:17:51.580
Everything seemed to
be going very well.

1:17:51.613 --> 1:17:53.482
In character, I
greeted our guests,

1:17:53.515 --> 1:17:55.484
presented them with
the first clue,

1:17:55.517 --> 1:17:57.286
then locked them
in the first room.

1:17:59.187 --> 1:18:03.792
Matthew seemed very
cool, almost too cool.

1:18:05.260 --> 1:18:08.397
After about 20 minutes
into the tour, he snapped.

1:18:10.532 --> 1:18:12.801
Yeah, it was super weird,

1:18:12.834 --> 1:18:14.570
like at first he seemed cool,

1:18:14.603 --> 1:18:16.305
and then he went totally agro.

1:18:16.338 --> 1:18:18.307
Yeah, he was screaming and
yelling at his girlfriend,

1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:19.708
hands all over
his buddy's woman,

1:18:19.741 --> 1:18:21.209
so then I stepped
in and I told him,

1:18:21.243 --> 1:18:22.411
you know knock it off.

1:18:22.444 --> 1:18:23.812
He lost it,

1:18:23.845 --> 1:18:25.547
pulled a knife out,
grabbed me by the hair

1:18:25.581 --> 1:18:28.116
and then he started saying he
wasn't gonna let anyone out

1:18:28.150 --> 1:18:30.019
unless his girlfriend
and his best friend

1:18:30.053 --> 1:18:31.955
admit they were screwing.

1:18:31.988 --> 1:18:33.388
Then I tackled him from behind

1:18:33.422 --> 1:18:35.157
and I told him no one
touches my daughter

1:18:35.190 --> 1:18:37.259
unless it's me, you know?

1:18:40.495 --> 1:18:41.330
What?

1:18:42.564 --> 1:18:43.900
I kicked the knife away

1:18:43.933 --> 1:18:46.268
and then I snuck out
the fire emergency exit.

1:18:46.301 --> 1:18:47.869
I fought Matthew off,

1:18:47.904 --> 1:18:49.104
I followed my daughter

1:18:49.137 --> 1:18:50.907
and then after that
it was all a blur.

1:18:50.940 --> 1:18:52.274
I just don't remember.

1:18:52.307 --> 1:18:54.409
Just adrenaline
flowing, you know,

1:18:54.443 --> 1:18:56.012
being a single dad and all,

1:18:56.045 --> 1:18:57.880
I'm just not meant
to be the hero.

1:18:59.414 --> 1:19:01.084
So you seeing anybody?

1:19:03.019 --> 1:19:05.120
Did he say
anything else to you?

1:19:05.153 --> 1:19:06.755
He just kept
giving a play by play

1:19:06.788 --> 1:19:10.158
of all the women I guess
he's killed over the years,

1:19:10.192 --> 1:19:11.393
dating back to the '90s.

1:19:11.426 --> 1:19:13.261
Yeah, like Ted Bundy.

1:19:13.295 --> 1:19:16.131
He was very handsome,
hot, hot with the ladies.

1:19:16.164 --> 1:19:17.066
Daddy.

1:19:17.100 --> 1:19:18.834
Yeah, what, what'd I say?

1:19:18.867 --> 1:19:20.669
Ted Bundy was real life.

1:19:20.702 --> 1:19:25.707
Okay.

1:19:28.011 --> 1:19:31.080
I've never been so
scared in my entire life.

1:19:32.048 --> 1:19:33.382
I love escape rooms,

1:19:33.415 --> 1:19:34.884
I mean this is the best but...

1:19:34.917 --> 1:19:37.152
Did Matthew try to harm you

1:19:37.185 --> 1:19:39.122
or did he provide any motive

1:19:39.154 --> 1:19:40.957
for his break with reality?

1:19:40.990 --> 1:19:43.792
I mean that dude obviously
has a problem with women.

1:19:43.825 --> 1:19:45.527
He was calling
all of them whores

1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:48.530
and saying that women have
wronged him his whole life.

1:19:48.563 --> 1:19:51.934
Then he grabbed that
poor girl by the throat

1:19:51.968 --> 1:19:53.235
and stuck a knife.

1:19:53.268 --> 1:19:55.570
I mean I froze 'cause
in escape rooms,

1:19:55.604 --> 1:19:58.107
you don't know what's
reality or what's part of it,

1:19:58.141 --> 1:20:00.308
if it's part of the thing.

1:20:00.342 --> 1:20:01.944
When did you know it was real?

1:20:03.112 --> 1:20:05.148
When Keith and Joe left,

1:20:07.516 --> 1:20:08.985
he strangled her.

1:20:09.018 --> 1:20:10.452
I mean he hit his girlfriend
over the head with a pipe

1:20:10.485 --> 1:20:12.554
and he strangled her
in front of her husband

1:20:12.587 --> 1:20:14.256
saying something
about an affair.

1:20:15.158 --> 1:20:17.093
So I went and hid in the room

1:20:17.126 --> 1:20:19.962
and I guess he forgot
about me or something.

1:20:19.996 --> 1:20:21.363
That's when responders came in.

1:20:21.396 --> 1:20:23.198
I'm lucky that I'm not dead.

1:20:23.231 --> 1:20:24.733
I'm lucky that I was not hurt.

1:20:30.106 --> 1:20:31.406
Fuck off!

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:34.010
Hey, fucking bitch!

1:20:34.043 --> 1:20:34.843
I'll fucking kill you!

1:20:34.877 --> 1:20:35.811
I loved him.

1:20:37.013 --> 1:20:40.716
I'll fucking kill you!

1:20:42.085 --> 1:20:44.053
Fuck off me, you know
who the fuck I am?

1:20:44.087 --> 1:20:45.054
God damn it.

1:20:46.788 --> 1:20:47.589
Fuck!

1:20:56.132 --> 1:20:59.035
I bet you feel crazy huh,

1:20:59.068 --> 1:21:01.336
'cause no one believes you?

1:21:01.369 --> 1:21:02.504
Never forget Emily

1:21:03.805 --> 1:21:05.208
that you can do
anything you want.

1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:07.110
I'll fucking kill you.

1:21:07.143 --> 1:21:08.643
If you put your mind to it.

1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:12.447
If you believe in monsters,

1:21:15.017 --> 1:21:17.719
you have to believe
that you can beat them.

1:21:20.655 --> 1:21:23.358
Some people say that
an eye for an eye

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:26.095
leaves the world blind.

1:21:29.198 --> 1:21:32.969
I say it's a hell of a
lot better to get even.

1:21:36.605 --> 1:21:38.707
Leaving people in the dust,

1:21:38.740 --> 1:21:41.043
the monsters that
try to take you down,

1:21:42.879 --> 1:21:44.679
is no way to live.

1:21:46.715 --> 1:21:51.720
Getting even is
the best revenge.
