00:22.231 --> 00:24.066
(in Japanese) Solomon, show Tetsuya.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.318
Yeah, I'm watching.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.291
Solomon, who's that?

00:43.544 --> 00:44.545
Hana.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.925
You should've told me you were coming.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.885
I'm glad I came.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.889
Now those bitches over there
know who you belong to.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.649
What's with her attitude?

01:11.446 --> 01:13.031
Solomon, look.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.533
I don't have any money today.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.334
Look.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.922
The rice is hard.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.427
Don't touch if you're not buying it.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.389
It's wrapped. It's meant to be touched.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.158
Do you think this is
what America's like?

01:57.201 --> 01:58.911
Like a convenience store?

01:58.994 --> 02:03.373
All prepackaged, ready to buy.
With so many choices. I love it.

02:05.918 --> 02:06.960
Hey.

02:07.044 --> 02:11.340
We should run away to America together.

02:15.052 --> 02:18.388
What are you talking about?
We don't have that kind of money.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.688
Money's easy, if you don't care
where it comes from.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.150
Of course it matters
where it comes from.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.819
Amen to Solomon.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.740
Your family raised you too well.
A boring life awaits you.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.159
That's not for me.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.078
I want to see it all.

02:41.161 --> 02:45.040
Hawaii. Paris. The penguins.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.126
But most of all, Hawaii.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.551
Nagano-san,

02:55.634 --> 02:59.930
my mama's always praising
how smart you are.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.685
But you're married, isn't that so?
She missed her chance.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.688
I've tasted your mother's fried chicken,
Hana-chan.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.774
Tell her I'm the one who's missing out.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.626
Let's not.

03:31.128 --> 03:34.840
Prove that I mean more
than those bitches from school.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.093
You already know how I feel.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.261
Do it.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.864
Wait, what's in your pocket?

03:59.781 --> 04:00.782
Run!

04:04.077 --> 04:05.245
Hana!

04:07.080 --> 04:08.290
Nagano-san, it was me!

04:08.373 --> 04:10.292
This is what you've come to!

04:10.876 --> 04:13.003
-Aren't you ashamed?
-I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.922
Her life's hard enough
with a divorced mother.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.548
I promise, we'll never come back!

04:17.507 --> 04:19.551
You're not getting off that easy!

04:19.635 --> 04:22.971
I know how to deal with your kind.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.473
You bastard!

04:24.556 --> 04:26.850
Hello? I caught a shoplifter in my store.
Come arrest him.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.061
Please, my dad will kill me!

04:29.144 --> 04:32.231
Another Korean, these troublemakers.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.399
I want him taken in.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.485
Right now.

04:36.568 --> 04:40.113
But if I don't do something,
this kid will never learn.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.042
Come immediately.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.216
Solomon, stop!

04:59.299 --> 05:02.135
Don't do it! Solomon!

05:27.661 --> 05:28.954
Are you hurt?

05:29.037 --> 05:31.290
No, I'm okay.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.166
You're his father?

05:38.797 --> 05:42.384
He's never done
anything like this before.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.345
That's why we call it a first offense.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.515
This is how it starts.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.769
No, he'll never do it again.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.229
I swear it.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.609
The store owner asked us
to inform his school--

05:58.692 --> 06:00.235
But then he'd be suspended!

06:00.319 --> 06:02.446
Even kicked out.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.822
But he's committed a crime.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.949
It was just some candy!

06:08.285 --> 06:10.370
I know what he did was wrong,

06:10.454 --> 06:13.332
and I will reprimand him severely
for this.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.375
I ask you to let him go, please.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.046
Hello?

06:21.048 --> 06:23.050
Yes, I am dealing
with that situation right now.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.428
Why is that?

06:29.139 --> 06:31.225
But shoplifters should be--

06:32.017 --> 06:33.602
I see.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.771
Yes. I understand.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.402
Look at me.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.992
It looks like you have a powerful friend
in this world.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.747
You can leave now.

06:56.542 --> 07:00.170
-That's it?
-I've been ordered to release him.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.932
Who made that call?

07:12.808 --> 07:14.476
That doesn't matter now.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.228
Explain yourself.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.021
Why did you do something like that?

07:19.398 --> 07:20.816
It was her fault, wasn't it?

07:20.899 --> 07:22.818
-No!
-Tell me the truth.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.362
Hana had nothing to do with it.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.620
Fine.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.123
I believe you.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.711
This can't happen ever again.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.883
But you're not getting off that easy.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.553
I'm sending you away to America.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.474
-I've finally made up my mind.
-I don't want to!

07:54.558 --> 07:58.770
You know, your mother
never wanted you to grow up here.

07:59.897 --> 08:03.817
But I wanted to keep you with me.
I was selfish.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.403
I see now that I was wrong.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.821
No, I can't leave Hana!

08:10.073 --> 08:13.035
Do you know how much worse
tonight could've gone?

08:13.744 --> 08:15.746
I don't want to go. This is my home.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.499
This is where you'll always have
that mark. You're going.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.211
Your grandmother will be sad,

08:23.128 --> 08:25.506
but I'll convince her
it's what's best for you.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.467
Get in.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.735
(in Korean) Have you lost your mind?

10:09.818 --> 10:11.528
Do you know what kind
of women go to those places?

10:11.612 --> 10:12.988
Lower your voice.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.656
The whole neighborhood already knows!

10:14.740 --> 10:16.200
How do you think I found out?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.036
We were just trying to help.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.955
Am I no longer the head of this house?

10:22.039 --> 10:24.458
Because that's what you just announced
to the world!

10:24.541 --> 10:26.835
It's not like that.

10:26.919 --> 10:28.587
Of course you are.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.635
And you. Have you no shame?

10:35.802 --> 10:38.972
It's bad enough things are so hard
for our people here…

10:40.891 --> 10:43.644
without the two of you
acting with no shame.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.771
No wonder they think the worst of us!

10:46.605 --> 10:48.482
She had nothing to do with this.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.025
The idea was mine alone.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.779
We had none of these troubles
until you entered this home.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.197
What am I to do now?

10:56.698 --> 10:58.575
How can I show my face again,

10:59.076 --> 11:01.495
knowing that some silly women
paid my debts?

11:01.578 --> 11:02.788
My nuts, they're shriveling!

11:02.871 --> 11:04.623
Why are you talking like this?

11:13.674 --> 11:15.175
Where did you get the watch?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.180
My mother gave it to me.

11:21.890 --> 11:22.933
Your mother?

11:25.853 --> 11:28.814
A widow who runs a boardinghouse
has a watch like that?

11:37.072 --> 11:38.866
I can't breathe here.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.750
We know we did wrong. We're sorry for it.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.503
Please, come back home.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.655
-Sunja!
-This can't be.

12:20.324 --> 12:22.117
It's not time for the baby to come yet.

12:32.461 --> 12:35.839
Unfortunately,
there is very little we can do.

12:37.716 --> 12:41.094
Your daughter has been ill
for some time now.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.848
At this moment, this is beyond help.

12:48.143 --> 12:52.773
And if rumors were to spread
that we have an AIDS patient here…

12:54.691 --> 12:57.903
In other words,
we aren't prepared to care for her.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.323
Please don't say that.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.909
I advise you to treat her at home.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.369
A family doctor to protect her--

13:05.452 --> 13:09.957
No. She deserves your care.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.959
I understand how you feel.

13:12.042 --> 13:16.088
But I cannot possibly ask my staff
to care for your daughter--

13:16.171 --> 13:17.464
I will do it.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.553
Let's move the patient to a separate wing.

13:24.263 --> 13:27.224
I think we can care for your daughter.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.310
Thank you very much.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.481
Very well.

13:35.399 --> 13:36.775
Thank you for speaking up.

13:41.822 --> 13:45.242
Speaking frankly, there is no cure.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.496
We don't know how long
she will hold out for.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.292
It could be months.

13:55.586 --> 14:00.299
It could be weeks or even days.

14:16.815 --> 14:20.569
I'm sorry to come to you like this,
but I am desperate.

14:20.652 --> 14:24.531
I thought at first he was
with those gang boys by the dock,

14:24.615 --> 14:27.618
but I fear he's now involved
with something more dangerous.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.621
I'm worried sick. He's my eldest.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.081
If anything were to happen to him…

14:34.249 --> 14:38.253
I was hoping you could speak to him.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.381
What makes you think
I'll have any success?

14:41.465 --> 14:43.258
Pastor Yoo would be better.

14:44.009 --> 14:47.262
But you're younger, more vigorous.

14:47.346 --> 14:50.182
You'll understand him better.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.769
I'm just a novice. I can't--

14:53.852 --> 14:55.646
He no longer answers my questions.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.940
Tells me the less I know, the safer I am.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.442
What could he mean by such a thing?

15:03.362 --> 15:05.864
I've already lost my husband here.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.575
If I lose my son as well…

15:08.659 --> 15:09.868
Do not upset yourself.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.707
I will go to him.

15:20.295 --> 15:23.966
I know there are some
who think you are too young,

15:24.049 --> 15:27.469
too ignorant because
of your privileged upbringing,

15:27.553 --> 15:30.222
but I feel fortunate to have you with us.

15:32.724 --> 15:36.395
Thank you,
but I still need to prove myself.

15:37.563 --> 15:39.982
I will do my best.

15:40.816 --> 15:45.571
You will get through to him.
I know you will.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.157
Thank you.

15:51.243 --> 15:52.995
Let's go.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.324
So my mother thought
she'd try with you as well.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.912
A mother's love isn't felled so easily.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.455
Be grateful for it.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.334
I have somewhere to be.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.088
I'll walk you then.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.301
Fine.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.933
Every day, I walk these streets,

16:56.808 --> 16:59.937
and I'm reminded how much I've lived
with my eyes closed.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.524
I heard about your father.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.361
How old were you when he died?

17:09.070 --> 17:10.239
Fourteen.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.492
It must have been a heavy burden,

17:14.576 --> 17:16.244
to be so young and to feed your family.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.454
Who doesn't have a story like that here?

17:19.164 --> 17:20.832
Just ask anyone.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.877
What would someone like you know?

17:32.886 --> 17:35.514
Hana, you should go to America.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.474
They know more about this over there.

17:39.768 --> 17:44.606
I have a friend from college
whose father's a famous surgeon.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.650
I'll reach out to him.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.652
Are you listening?

17:54.366 --> 17:56.285
Hana, listen to me.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.788
It is what it is.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.124
What?

18:03.792 --> 18:06.712
You were the only 14-year-old boy
who talked like that, Solomon.

18:07.296 --> 18:09.548
I'm not going to America.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.550
Then what are you going to do?

18:11.633 --> 18:13.427
Staying here won't change anything.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.930
I'll just die.

18:21.977 --> 18:26.440
Solomon, you still can't take a joke.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.401
So adorable.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.866
But you never could see things
as they are, could you?

18:39.161 --> 18:40.746
Never could.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.002
Time to open your eyes, Pastor.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.548
Those men and I,

18:51.632 --> 18:53.342
we go into the ground…

18:54.343 --> 18:55.511
For what?

18:56.011 --> 18:59.890
So some subway can carry more workers
further and faster away.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.976
So they can break their backs like us.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.355
But do you hear us asking for the spoils?

19:07.648 --> 19:12.528
Just something, anything, to set us apart
from animals who shit on the streets.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.696
I feel what you are saying, truly.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.282
But to speak so openly like this…

19:18.200 --> 19:19.493
It's not just you and your family,

19:19.576 --> 19:21.703
but we all will feel that hammer
of theirs strike us down.

19:21.787 --> 19:22.913
All these people!

19:22.996 --> 19:24.790
You think I don't know?

19:25.666 --> 19:27.835
You don't think my mother's face
haunts my dreams,

19:27.918 --> 19:30.003
shaking me awake with tears in my eyes?

19:30.671 --> 19:33.131
I think of all of them.
My brothers, my sisters,

19:33.215 --> 19:35.968
even strangers I've yet to meet.

19:37.386 --> 19:41.640
But if I allow my fears to shape me…

19:44.643 --> 19:47.312
I would no longer recognize
my own outlines.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.941
Then how can I call that my body?

19:53.026 --> 19:55.779
And without a body,
can I call myself a man?

20:08.876 --> 20:10.210
Solomon…

20:13.255 --> 20:15.257
after you left for America…

20:18.510 --> 20:23.390
I used to stare at
all those fancy homes and imagine…

20:25.434 --> 20:28.979
how great it would be
to grow up in a family like that.

20:29.563 --> 20:31.648
Surely, the children of those families

20:31.732 --> 20:37.112
never got the empty feeling
that nothing good would come of them.

20:41.158 --> 20:44.536
I got this disease from a guy
who came from one of those families.

20:45.537 --> 20:46.872
You know,

20:46.955 --> 20:51.627
one of those who loves to brag
about their samurai ancestors and crap.

20:52.753 --> 20:54.254
Why are you telling me this?

20:55.005 --> 21:01.094
Because you need to know
how I've lived my life.

21:02.346 --> 21:07.309
And you need to see how I've ended up.

21:08.894 --> 21:12.314
The Hana you knew is gone.

21:27.579 --> 21:32.626
We are not men. Not to them.

21:35.921 --> 21:39.091
And this humiliation,
it drives us to drink,

21:40.133 --> 21:41.385
and to fight,

21:42.678 --> 21:44.972
and to return home to beat our wives.

21:47.099 --> 21:49.810
There, at least we know
we're not the lowest.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.480
There's even someone lower.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.818
We've been playing by their rules,

21:59.027 --> 22:02.698
but are we not still cold, still hungry?

22:06.159 --> 22:07.870
It's time we shatter those rules.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.497
Be careful with your words.

22:12.374 --> 22:15.210
Men have been arrested
for saying far less.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.262
You still don't see it, do you?

22:25.345 --> 22:27.222
Maybe it's the suit.

22:27.806 --> 22:28.807
Wait.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.895
What do I tell your mother?

22:33.562 --> 22:38.567
Tell her she has a son
who is grateful for his mother's love.

22:48.035 --> 22:50.287
Solomon, look at me.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.294
You will never be one of them,

22:57.377 --> 22:59.338
even with your nice clothes,
your fancy degrees.

23:04.051 --> 23:06.887
Sure, they'll leave the door open
just wide enough

23:06.970 --> 23:08.639
to make you think you have a chance,

23:09.389 --> 23:10.724
but don't be fooled.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.662
Looks like you're having a rough one.

24:15.998 --> 24:19.251
I know you. You're Mamoru Yoshii.

24:19.751 --> 24:24.214
I've heard of you too.
The boy who crashed the deal.

24:24.923 --> 24:26.633
Is that what they're saying?

24:28.093 --> 24:31.096
I'm not a man
with a good reputation either.

24:34.433 --> 24:35.809
I think the two of us…

24:37.936 --> 24:40.022
we have much in common.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.151
Are you okay?

24:45.944 --> 24:47.487
Don't worry about me.

24:48.447 --> 24:51.783
Women have been giving birth forever,
haven't they? Go on.

24:52.409 --> 24:55.370
Go and find Yoseb, quickly.

24:55.454 --> 24:56.705
Kyunghee is worried sick.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.543
Yes, find him quickly.

25:02.711 --> 25:05.047
He can be reckless
when he gets like this.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.424
Any idea where he would go?

25:07.508 --> 25:09.635
He'll be at the bar
below the streetcar stop.

25:10.594 --> 25:13.722
But please don't judge him too harshly.

25:15.891 --> 25:18.560
Don't worry. I'll make it right.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.913
Do you know who I am?

25:40.290 --> 25:42.125
I'm from the noble class!

25:43.961 --> 25:49.633
My family is from one
of the oldest houses in Pyongyang!

25:49.716 --> 25:54.555
Wow, you're a noble? You don't say?

25:55.472 --> 25:57.641
Me, I'm a noble too!

25:59.017 --> 26:01.395
And so is this good gentleman here.

26:01.478 --> 26:03.814
Me as well! Noble class!

26:05.649 --> 26:08.402
Who are you to mock me?

26:09.945 --> 26:15.492
My boss relies on me.

26:15.576 --> 26:20.080
Can you say the same
about your foul pigs?

26:20.789 --> 26:23.709
More the other way around, as I see it.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.752
I always wondered how you managed it,

26:26.753 --> 26:30.215
how you kept your job for so long.

26:30.299 --> 26:33.802
What are you? A spy for the Japanese?

26:33.886 --> 26:35.971
Or a thief?

26:38.557 --> 26:39.600
Yoseb!

26:42.936 --> 26:44.229
What are you doing here?

26:51.570 --> 26:52.738
Did she send you?

26:54.781 --> 26:56.408
Sunja's in labor.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.539
Go.

27:03.248 --> 27:04.917
I want to finish my drink.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.295
I'm of no use there.

27:10.756 --> 27:12.758
You're feeling sorry for yourself now.

27:21.642 --> 27:23.894
Hey! An extra cup here!

27:23.977 --> 27:26.939
Why are you here? Go to your wife.

27:28.065 --> 27:30.067
She's the one who told me to find you.

27:32.444 --> 27:35.948
And what about you?
Are you a noble as well?

27:37.199 --> 27:38.867
Does that matter now?

27:38.951 --> 27:40.702
Those things mean nothing here.

27:45.499 --> 27:47.125
Bastard.

27:48.210 --> 27:49.878
It's what they want,

27:50.546 --> 27:52.089
for us to turn on one another.

27:53.423 --> 27:57.678
Hey, do you really believe
we're all the same now?

27:58.846 --> 28:01.390
You, who had a servant
to tend to all your needs?

28:01.473 --> 28:04.268
And where is he now?

28:05.853 --> 28:11.567
Our parents' hardships come no easier
dwelling on what's been lost.

28:13.652 --> 28:15.279
That's a fool's game, brother.

28:23.787 --> 28:25.914
What's the point fighting
amongst ourselves?

28:49.771 --> 28:52.191
Your family certainly
made you the investment.

28:52.858 --> 28:56.278
Choate, Yale. Expensive résumé.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.947
Could say the same thing about you.

28:59.031 --> 29:01.491
UCLA, Stanford Law.

29:03.285 --> 29:05.078
And now we're both back.

29:05.704 --> 29:08.999
And I hear your father's
pachinko parlor is doing well.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.044
Why bring up pachinko all of a sudden?

29:13.212 --> 29:14.630
Pachinko interests me.

29:15.839 --> 29:18.926
Why? It's for people
who have no other options.

29:19.009 --> 29:20.552
Perhaps a long time ago.

29:22.721 --> 29:24.139
I'm not following.

29:24.973 --> 29:26.934
You want us to get into pachinko?

29:27.017 --> 29:28.227
Not here.

29:28.852 --> 29:32.189
The market's too crowded,
thanks to people like your father.

29:33.106 --> 29:35.526
But in Korea, Thailand, Macau.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.862
Who knows? Vegas even.

29:43.283 --> 29:48.539
And this big idea of yours,

29:49.540 --> 29:51.792
is it legitimate?

29:51.875 --> 29:53.877
You mean is it legal?

29:57.381 --> 29:58.423
Yes.

30:01.260 --> 30:02.261
I…

30:03.512 --> 30:05.264
I loved my grandfather very much.

30:06.223 --> 30:09.476
But it's not like I didn't know
who he was,

30:09.560 --> 30:11.687
or what he was doing.

30:12.312 --> 30:13.480
I don't deny it.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.400
The world may have seen him
as a villain,

30:17.234 --> 30:18.402
but to me,

30:19.486 --> 30:21.196
he was the man who saved me

30:22.155 --> 30:23.615
from my drug-addicted father,

30:23.699 --> 30:26.159
his own son.

30:27.619 --> 30:29.037
What I'm trying to say is…

30:30.831 --> 30:33.041
I am not ashamed of my grandfather.

30:34.793 --> 30:35.919
However…

30:38.755 --> 30:40.132
I'm not him.

30:41.091 --> 30:42.342
And people like us,

30:43.135 --> 30:45.637
we don't need to walk
in our family's shadows.

30:47.181 --> 30:48.765
Not anymore.

30:51.935 --> 30:53.520
Just think about it.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.991
Where's your yakuza boyfriend?

31:08.577 --> 31:12.748
Just because he owns a pachinko parlor
doesn't mean he's a yakuza.

31:14.666 --> 31:16.043
We came here in a hurry,

31:17.002 --> 31:19.129
so he went back
to get some things we'll need.

31:24.134 --> 31:26.178
I always wondered.

31:27.095 --> 31:30.224
I'm sure he had a lot of women
to choose from,

31:31.058 --> 31:32.726
despite being Korean.

31:34.311 --> 31:36.605
But why did he choose you?

31:37.648 --> 31:40.067
And he didn't leave you,
even after he heard

31:40.150 --> 31:42.694
how often you used to spread your legs
for all those other men.

31:48.158 --> 31:49.159
Save your breath.

31:52.287 --> 31:53.830
You can't make me fight.

31:55.332 --> 31:58.669
So you'll just bore me until I die?

31:58.752 --> 32:01.880
In that case, bring me a knife
and I'll just die right now!

32:11.515 --> 32:12.850
Grandmother,

32:14.059 --> 32:15.269
you're here too.

32:17.312 --> 32:19.189
It's a damn family reunion.

32:20.107 --> 32:22.150
Go buy me some coffee.

32:32.828 --> 32:38.250
Etsuko-san spent a great deal of money
looking for you.

32:39.334 --> 32:44.173
You Koreans are so obsessed with money.

32:45.424 --> 32:47.509
Everyone told her it was hopeless,

32:47.593 --> 32:49.970
but she wouldn't give up.

32:51.346 --> 32:56.894
No mother can ever give up on her child.

32:56.977 --> 32:58.228
Why are you here?

32:59.146 --> 33:03.609
Tell me the truth.
You don't even like her.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.572
Just like you hated me being
with your darling grandson.

33:11.992 --> 33:17.206
I know you knew about Solomon and me.

33:27.216 --> 33:29.009
Grandmother,

33:29.635 --> 33:32.513
everyone thinks you're such a saint.

33:35.307 --> 33:38.101
But if Solomon ever finds out

33:38.185 --> 33:40.354
you were the one
who told me to run away,

33:41.230 --> 33:43.190
what do you think he would say?

33:48.946 --> 33:50.364
What the hell?

33:51.323 --> 33:55.369
Don't you remember what you said
after Solomon went to America?

34:01.875 --> 34:04.837
You said it was good
that he had gotten away from us.

34:06.046 --> 34:10.926
Because if he stayed,
we would only ruin him.

34:11.802 --> 34:14.554
You meant me. I would ruin him.

34:16.014 --> 34:18.641
And I have despised you
ever since for saying that,

34:18.725 --> 34:21.478
even if I knew you were right!

34:23.522 --> 34:26.525
You thought I was talking about you?

34:32.989 --> 34:37.369
I said those words… about me.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.415
You?

34:48.922 --> 34:52.426
Once, I had another son.

34:55.387 --> 34:57.472
And he was good as well.

35:00.267 --> 35:06.023
But because I ruined his life…

35:08.066 --> 35:09.568
he is gone now.

35:43.435 --> 35:46.480
Why won't the baby come?

35:47.731 --> 35:49.399
I don't know.

35:50.817 --> 35:51.860
Enough!

35:52.444 --> 35:54.947
How is anyone to rest with all this noise?

35:56.949 --> 35:59.451
You have no right to just barge in here!

36:00.702 --> 36:01.870
Look at those hips!

36:01.954 --> 36:03.580
What are you doing?

36:04.206 --> 36:06.542
I've delivered enough pigs
to know how this works.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.627
Help me.

36:08.710 --> 36:10.003
Come on now!

36:12.339 --> 36:16.426
Listen! More clean linens.
And water. Now!

36:16.510 --> 36:18.637
Bear down on your feet!

36:18.720 --> 36:20.681
I have no more energy.

36:21.265 --> 36:22.432
Push!

36:22.516 --> 36:24.601
Together!

36:24.685 --> 36:27.145
Mother!

36:27.229 --> 36:29.565
More! More! More!

36:31.441 --> 36:36.738
In this world of troubles

36:36.822 --> 36:43.662
What is your hope?

36:44.496 --> 36:50.752
Isn't it enough that you've enjoyed

36:52.171 --> 36:58.677
Wealth and prosperity?

36:59.261 --> 37:00.345
Cheers!

37:04.349 --> 37:06.310
Special Higher Police. Routine inspection.

37:10.314 --> 37:12.107
I need to check your bag.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.283
-Get up.
-Is there a problem?

37:21.783 --> 37:24.036
I've done nothing wrong.

37:24.119 --> 37:26.205
Give me your bag.
I need to check inside.

37:26.288 --> 37:27.998
Just my work clothes.

37:28.081 --> 37:29.416
Hand it over now.

37:45.641 --> 37:49.436
Hey, what's inside your coat pockets?

37:50.521 --> 37:51.772
Rise.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.026
Hurry.

38:08.705 --> 38:11.041
Please. They're for my pigs.

38:27.891 --> 38:29.142
Stay still.

38:41.989 --> 38:45.701
I need a bigger push! You're doing well.

38:46.451 --> 38:49.246
You're doing great. Just a little more!

38:50.706 --> 38:52.875
You need to push for the baby to come out.

38:52.958 --> 38:55.627
-I can't do any more.
-Come on, one more!

38:55.711 --> 38:57.171
You can do this.

38:57.254 --> 38:59.131
Sunja, you are strong.

38:59.214 --> 39:02.843
Come on, one more! A little more.

39:02.926 --> 39:05.012
Then the baby will come out.

39:05.095 --> 39:07.598
It'll come. Keep pushing!

39:07.681 --> 39:09.349
You're doing well.

39:11.351 --> 39:13.270
How could we have just all sat there?

39:16.481 --> 39:18.192
To think I did nothing--

39:18.275 --> 39:19.860
Of course you did nothing!

39:20.694 --> 39:23.697
That's called survival.

39:24.698 --> 39:26.450
Why do you have to carry it all?

39:27.326 --> 39:30.621
How much longer do you have to do this?
Haven't you suffered enough?

39:31.914 --> 39:35.584
And to take pity on a girl like her,
to bring her into our home…

39:37.169 --> 39:38.837
Just stop it!

39:46.428 --> 39:48.847
You are not to talk about Sunja like that.

39:50.599 --> 39:52.351
I won't allow it.

39:52.976 --> 39:54.937
I'm sorry. I spoke badly.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.855
It's not just your words,

39:56.939 --> 39:59.107
but your thoughts as well.

40:02.611 --> 40:03.779
Brother…

40:06.782 --> 40:08.951
I should have died this year.

40:11.036 --> 40:13.205
But instead, I stand before you.

40:13.956 --> 40:15.916
And Sunja is to thank for that.

40:19.670 --> 40:24.341
You don't know what she's done,
or what she's capable of.

40:26.593 --> 40:29.221
But I do.

40:31.932 --> 40:34.101
It's coming!

40:34.184 --> 40:35.185
Keep pushing!

40:35.269 --> 40:37.771
One more time, push!

40:41.233 --> 40:44.319
I see the head. The baby's coming!

40:44.987 --> 40:47.656
With Sunja, I have this feeling…

40:49.741 --> 40:51.118
that perhaps my life…

40:52.744 --> 40:54.872
can be significant somehow.

40:57.583 --> 41:00.002
Not on a grand scale,

41:00.085 --> 41:02.129
but I feel like I can do something.

41:04.923 --> 41:07.759
I don't want my child
to grow up in a world like this.

41:10.053 --> 41:11.346
I want my child…

41:15.350 --> 41:18.187
to recognize the outlines
of his or her body,

41:18.270 --> 41:22.065
and I want this child to thrive.

41:25.903 --> 41:29.281
Brother, don't our children deserve
at least that?

41:31.116 --> 41:32.618
You do,

41:33.744 --> 41:34.870
and I do as well.

41:50.010 --> 41:53.472
Sunja, it's a boy.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.700
I know this face.

42:19.039 --> 42:20.624
My mother.

42:23.961 --> 42:25.128
My father.

42:30.342 --> 42:32.052
I know him.

42:41.728 --> 42:43.939
Come, meet your son.

42:44.022 --> 42:45.524
A son?

43:04.835 --> 43:06.128
My son.

43:10.924 --> 43:13.135
To think that they turn into us.

43:19.766 --> 43:21.185
Brother-in-law…

43:25.230 --> 43:27.608
will you name the baby?

43:33.155 --> 43:34.239
Me?

43:35.407 --> 43:36.867
I don't deserve that honor.

43:52.424 --> 43:54.092
You are the crown of this family.

43:57.471 --> 43:59.431
It is not an honor, but a duty.

44:41.014 --> 44:45.143
He who opened a new world…

44:48.605 --> 44:50.148
who believed…

44:53.819 --> 44:55.445
when no one else did.

45:00.534 --> 45:01.952
Let's call him Noa.

45:18.677 --> 45:19.928
Do I…

45:21.471 --> 45:23.015
look hideous to you?

45:31.440 --> 45:36.904
I only worry that you are in pain.

45:42.367 --> 45:44.286
You are still my Hana.

45:46.163 --> 45:48.081
Nothing will ever change that.

46:04.806 --> 46:06.433
Is there more?

46:08.810 --> 46:11.396
I didn't realize how hungry I was.

46:15.108 --> 46:19.530
There's always more. Eat up.

46:40.008 --> 46:43.053
Grandmother, where did you get all this?

46:43.136 --> 46:45.347
The hotel had a portable gas stove.

46:45.430 --> 46:47.349
I brought the side dishes from home.

46:48.725 --> 46:50.477
You brought side dishes from home?

46:51.144 --> 46:53.981
I didn't know how long we'd be here.

46:54.064 --> 46:55.858
Look how much this bento box holds.

46:55.941 --> 46:58.527
-Come eat.
-I'm not hungry.

46:58.610 --> 47:00.654
You need to keep your strength up now.

47:00.737 --> 47:03.073
-Eat.
-I told you I don't want to eat.

47:12.708 --> 47:14.293
The bank fired me

47:15.335 --> 47:17.671
because I told Mrs. Han not to sign.

47:21.091 --> 47:22.676
It's your fault.

47:23.844 --> 47:25.053
You made me pity her,

47:26.305 --> 47:27.890
and you made me weak.

47:28.515 --> 47:30.601
That's not weakness.

47:32.686 --> 47:33.896
Whatever it was,

47:34.646 --> 47:35.981
it's ruined me.

47:38.483 --> 47:40.652
Everything I've worked so hard for.

47:45.824 --> 47:49.536
Do you really think
your life has been a hard one?

47:49.620 --> 47:50.996
So now you too.

47:53.373 --> 47:55.250
Do you resent me

47:56.043 --> 47:58.837
for having what you didn't,
or not suffering as you did?

48:02.966 --> 48:05.010
Fine. You're right.

48:06.637 --> 48:08.472
I'll never win that.

48:09.973 --> 48:11.767
I had a choice too, you know.

48:12.809 --> 48:14.102
A long time ago.

48:17.856 --> 48:21.735
I could've had unspeakable riches,
but I turned it down.

48:25.113 --> 48:26.573
This was before the war.

48:29.785 --> 48:32.120
Before I married your grandfather.

48:36.917 --> 48:38.460
Why didn't you take it?

48:43.674 --> 48:47.886
How could I live
with a life split in half?

48:48.720 --> 48:51.932
One life I could talk about,
and the other half hidden away.

48:56.019 --> 48:57.646
That means something.

48:59.773 --> 49:01.525
More important than being successful

49:01.608 --> 49:04.236
is how you came by your success.

49:07.072 --> 49:08.365
I know, Grandmother.

49:09.032 --> 49:10.284
I'm trying.

49:41.648 --> 49:43.108
You'll be late.

49:54.536 --> 49:56.788
Why don't you wear your suit anymore?

50:01.752 --> 50:03.795
God doesn't need me in a suit.

50:07.549 --> 50:08.884
This feels more comfortable.

50:29.947 --> 50:31.698
What is it?

50:34.034 --> 50:35.744
I have a son now.

50:38.622 --> 50:40.541
Where you failed,

50:41.667 --> 50:43.627
another woman has succeeded.

50:46.171 --> 50:47.381
Are you listening?

50:50.467 --> 50:53.762
Some women are more accommodating,
aren't they?

50:53.846 --> 50:55.848
I don't need to explain her to you.

50:57.391 --> 50:58.642
But with this,

50:59.142 --> 51:01.854
you are released
from your conjugal duties.

51:04.231 --> 51:05.691
You must be pleased.

51:07.317 --> 51:11.280
I know this marriage
has been a curse to you.

51:12.239 --> 51:14.575
It's some solace, I suppose.

51:15.868 --> 51:17.369
But it's too late.

51:18.203 --> 51:19.329
My body,

51:20.372 --> 51:22.124
you have sullied it.

51:28.881 --> 51:29.923
But…

51:31.717 --> 51:33.552
your darling son,

51:35.012 --> 51:37.264
I wonder what he will think of you.
