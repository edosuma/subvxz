00:03.450 --> 00:06.350
What do you know about the group
calling themselves Deus Ex Machina?

00:06.409 --> 00:08.589
They're hackers. And what's your
connection to them?

00:08.608 --> 00:09.568
I don't have one.

00:09.573 --> 00:12.119
No-one knows the real identity
of the leader of Deus Ex.

00:12.376 --> 00:14.016
Would you like to see a photo
of him?

00:14.408 --> 00:15.488
Remind you of anyone?

00:15.608 --> 00:17.168
You hacked the NSA?

00:17.288 --> 00:19.403
Yeah. I know it was Spike.

00:19.403 --> 00:20.996
It should be me in there, not you.

00:20.996 --> 00:22.396
I'm getting out soon. I promise.

00:22.515 --> 00:24.275
These ladies bothering you, hon?

00:24.313 --> 00:25.633
Oh, Jesus.

00:25.691 --> 00:27.891
I am Sister Celine,
here for the interview.

00:28.051 --> 00:31.691
I need someone tenacious,
with a clear head and thick skin.

00:31.851 --> 00:34.771
You are just another sad little man
who touches his penis too much.

00:34.891 --> 00:36.491
When can you start?

00:36.651 --> 00:38.971
What sort of person pretends
that his wife's been

00:39.091 --> 00:40.891
missing for seven years?

00:41.011 --> 00:42.411
There she is.

00:42.531 --> 00:44.131
Layla's alive. Layla?

00:44.251 --> 00:46.851
And it seems there's another me.

00:46.971 --> 00:48.691
Rhonda, get in!

00:48.811 --> 00:50.491
I'm coming too!

00:50.611 --> 00:52.051
No!

00:52.171 --> 00:54.051
You're adopted, Jamie.

00:54.211 --> 00:56.971
And I meant to tell you.
There just never seemed a good time.

00:57.219 --> 00:59.623
And this is a good time?!

01:13.428 --> 01:16.828
See that? That's what's going to
kill everyone.

01:17.937 --> 01:20.337
Any second now.

01:20.457 --> 01:22.417
Doesn't matter who you are,

01:22.536 --> 01:24.136
who you pray to,

01:24.257 --> 01:26.337
black or white, straight or gay,

01:26.457 --> 01:27.937
rich or poor.

01:31.657 --> 01:33.417
Yep, it's judgment day.

01:33.537 --> 01:35.257
The actual apocalypse.

01:35.377 --> 01:36.497
And where am I?

01:36.617 --> 01:40.377
In Slough - or rather under Slough,

01:40.497 --> 01:42.097
watching it on telly.

01:42.217 --> 01:43.977
One minute now. One minute.

01:44.137 --> 01:46.777
These pictures coming live to us
from Hubble.

01:46.937 --> 01:48.737
I know what you're thinking,
"Cheer up!"

01:48.857 --> 01:51.057
"You're one of the lucky ones!"

01:51.177 --> 01:53.257
My question is - am I?

01:53.417 --> 01:55.537
I mean, have you seen who else
is in here?

01:57.857 --> 01:59.217
Who are these people?

01:59.377 --> 02:01.137
The human race united
as never before...

02:01.257 --> 02:03.497
How the hell did this happen?

02:03.657 --> 02:07.697
Are we the future of mankind?
I mean, seriously?

02:10.497 --> 02:13.337
Thank you all for watching.
I hope we'll meet again.

02:28.297 --> 02:31.417
Come on, it's here somewhere,
I know it is. I saw it here today.

02:31.537 --> 02:33.217
Scotty? Everyone's waiting.

02:33.337 --> 02:34.817
What the hell are you looking for?

02:34.937 --> 02:37.777
My homeopathic spray.

02:37.897 --> 02:39.737
Yes!

02:39.897 --> 02:42.057
I got it. I got all tense
and it calms me down.

02:42.177 --> 02:44.857
Scotty, out! You should try it. Now.

02:52.377 --> 02:54.817
You say everyone's waiting? Yeah.

02:54.937 --> 02:56.817
Everyone, everyone.

03:00.177 --> 03:03.017
Now, just relax.
You know it inside out.

03:03.177 --> 03:05.297
You've practised this
a million times.

03:07.337 --> 03:08.857
Excuse me.

03:11.337 --> 03:12.977
Hello?

03:13.137 --> 03:16.817
Could someone please tell me
what the hell is going on?

03:16.977 --> 03:20.817
Chill, OK? We just had to make sure
we weren't being followed.

03:20.937 --> 03:22.617
Who the hell are you?

03:25.497 --> 03:27.257
Can you feel it, Rhonda?

03:27.377 --> 03:28.857
The spark?

03:29.017 --> 03:31.417
This must be what it was like
when Lennon met McCartney.

03:31.577 --> 03:35.817
The two greatest hackers of our
generation, face-to-face at last.

03:35.977 --> 03:39.977
Yeah, that's right. You're looking at
the White Horse himself.

03:40.137 --> 03:43.497
Honoured to meet you,
Boobmuncher2000.

03:45.577 --> 03:47.737
Yeah, that's my username.

03:47.857 --> 03:49.417
So you did all this for me, why?

03:49.577 --> 03:52.097
You're the only person to have
hacked the NSA, ever.

03:52.257 --> 03:56.257
I mean, you scaled the walls of
Castle fucking Grayskull itself!

03:57.417 --> 04:00.137
And I want to know how you did it.

04:03.857 --> 04:05.457
Uh, yeah...

04:05.617 --> 04:09.217
How about you get me home first?
Then I'll show you.

04:09.377 --> 04:13.457
You're a hard-nosed arsehole,
Boobmuncher2000. I like that.

04:13.577 --> 04:15.417
OK. Deal.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.257
This your girlfriend, son?

04:19.416 --> 04:22.017
Punching a little above your weight,
ain't ya?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.657
Why would you...?

04:23.777 --> 04:25.417
Now it's dirty!

04:25.537 --> 04:27.497
Don't ever touch my stuff.

04:31.777 --> 04:34.057
Boobmuncher2000?

04:34.217 --> 04:38.497
Bullshit. It's going to be OK.
Just stop antagonising them.

04:38.617 --> 04:40.217
Got a bad feeling about this.

04:42.337 --> 04:44.297
You ask me,
they look a little Jew-y.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.937
You off somewhere, mate?

04:52.097 --> 04:53.977
Moscow. That photo was taken
in Moscow.

04:54.137 --> 04:56.977
I'm going to find out what the
hell's going on.

04:57.137 --> 04:59.537
You know, 24 hours ago,
I was doing OK!

04:59.697 --> 05:02.177
I mean, my life was shit,
but at least it made sense.

05:02.297 --> 05:03.737
And then all of a sudden - oh, yeah!

05:03.777 --> 05:06.417
Your wife's alive and she's with
some fucker that looks like you.

05:06.577 --> 05:09.097
Oh, and also, your mum's not your
mum and you're going to die!

05:09.257 --> 05:11.137
Best Regards, the Universe.
Where is it?

05:11.297 --> 05:14.177
You didn't sleep, did you? You're
always tetchy when you're tired.

05:14.337 --> 05:17.257
How am I meant to sleep? How can
anyone sleep at a time like this?

05:17.377 --> 05:18.657
I slept. Like a log.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.297
How?

05:20.457 --> 05:23.137
There is a massive rock
headed this way!

05:23.297 --> 05:26.177
I know, which is why I'm writing
my bucket list!

05:26.297 --> 05:28.177
How do you spell Minaj?

05:28.297 --> 05:30.097
What have you done with my passport?

05:30.257 --> 05:32.417
Look, I confiscated it.
It's for your own good.

05:32.577 --> 05:35.017
You're having a meltdown, mate.
I am not having a meltdown!

05:35.137 --> 05:36.217
OK, look.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.257
Do you know where in the very large
city of Moscow that photo was taken?

05:39.417 --> 05:41.337
No. Do you know anybody there
who could help you?

05:41.417 --> 05:43.017
Do you speak Russian?

05:43.177 --> 05:47.257
Do you honestly think there'll be any
flights going to Moscow today?

05:47.377 --> 05:48.737
I mean, you know me, man.

05:48.897 --> 05:52.257
I love an adventure, but honestly,
is this a good idea?

05:52.417 --> 05:55.617
I've got to do something. I know,
I know, so let's do something.

05:55.777 --> 05:58.017
But let's start a bit closer to home,
yeah?

06:24.977 --> 06:26.977
Mum, what's happened?

06:29.497 --> 06:32.857
I always wanted a
through-kitchen diner.

06:32.977 --> 06:34.457
I thought, "What the hell?"

06:36.777 --> 06:38.297
It looks crap, doesn't it?

06:40.297 --> 06:42.337
I've ruined my kitchen!

06:42.497 --> 06:47.817
The world's coming to an end
and you hate me, don't you?

06:49.577 --> 06:51.377
I'll put the kettle on.

07:01.257 --> 07:02.577
Go away.

07:02.697 --> 07:05.377
I did. Twice already, remember?

07:05.497 --> 07:08.097
I would like to start to work now.

07:08.217 --> 07:09.537
All right.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.457
Since we're going to be working
together, I think you should know

07:12.577 --> 07:14.297
I am not a morning person.

07:15.657 --> 07:18.617
Father Jude? The cardinals would
like to see you immediately.

07:18.777 --> 07:21.977
Just when you think the apocalypse
is as bad as it gets,

07:22.097 --> 07:24.857
that sticks its head in the door.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.697
What should I do?

07:26.857 --> 07:29.617
Your desk is buried
under there somewhere.

07:29.737 --> 07:32.137
You might want to dig it out.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.097
The looting is out of control, sir.

07:36.257 --> 07:40.697
Gas shortages... Riots in 36 cities.
Law and order disintegrating.

07:40.817 --> 07:42.817
And what's that going to do?

07:42.937 --> 07:44.417
Enough!

07:46.337 --> 07:49.657
OK. We are all tired.

07:49.777 --> 07:52.257
But we need to be better than this.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.457
Hey, you don't know how to hook
this up, do you?

07:54.617 --> 07:57.017
HDMI dealy to get the whole
high-depth thing.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.577
But I could do old-school VGA
if need be.

07:59.697 --> 08:00.857
Who the fuck is this?

08:01.017 --> 08:05.137
Mr President, this is Scotty McNeil,
from the Special Situations group.

08:05.297 --> 08:08.297
That's our apocalypse planning
department.

08:08.417 --> 08:09.697
We have one of those?

08:09.817 --> 08:11.497
We certainly do, Mr President.

08:11.657 --> 08:15.177
Scotty is our foremost expert
on extinction-level events.

08:15.337 --> 08:17.657
I suggest we all listen to what
he has to say.

08:20.457 --> 08:22.297
You have my undivided attention.

08:29.297 --> 08:31.057
HA!

08:32.817 --> 08:34.817
That shouldn't be there...

08:36.977 --> 08:40.937
We're looking at an impact event
caused by a comet approximately

08:41.057 --> 08:42.777
eight miles wide.

08:42.937 --> 08:45.337
Now, most of the Earth's
population will perish

08:45.497 --> 08:48.377
in a chain of devastating
earthquakes in the aftermath.

08:48.537 --> 08:51.457
In turn, these quakes will trigger a
series of tsunamis,

08:51.617 --> 08:54.337
which will sweep across
entire continents,

08:54.497 --> 08:57.177
washing away most traces
of civilisation.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.217
And meanwhile,
to compound our problems,

09:00.337 --> 09:02.257
there's also the dust cloud.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.617
Now this gradually envelops
the planet in a toxic,

09:05.777 --> 09:08.257
unbreathable smog,
blocking out the sun entirely,

09:08.417 --> 09:11.657
meaning that all plant life
becomes unsustainable,

09:11.777 --> 09:13.257
as does all animal life.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.857
The only survivors
will be microbial.

09:21.817 --> 09:24.257
But it could be worse.

09:25.577 --> 09:27.857
How could this be worse?

09:28.017 --> 09:29.697
Well, it could be happening
tomorrow, sir.

09:29.857 --> 09:33.737
We're lucky. We have 33 days
and we need to use them wisely.

09:37.137 --> 09:38.897
I should have told you.

09:39.057 --> 09:44.417
All the adoption books say to.
I meant to, but you were all I had.

09:44.577 --> 09:47.217
I didn't want to share you
with your birth family.

09:49.177 --> 09:52.097
You want to find them, don't you?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.257
But you'll always be my mum.

09:55.777 --> 10:00.217
OK? All my many flaws and faults,
they're all your doing.

10:00.337 --> 10:02.217
No-one can take that away from you.

10:04.097 --> 10:07.137
So is there anything you know that
can help me? Anything at all?

10:20.177 --> 10:22.497
When you were five,

10:22.617 --> 10:24.417
a woman came to the door.

10:24.537 --> 10:26.977
She said that she was your mum.

10:28.817 --> 10:30.577
Do you really want to know?

10:30.697 --> 10:33.097
Yeah, everything.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.377
Well, I won't sugar-coat it.

10:35.497 --> 10:37.217
She was weird.

10:39.497 --> 10:41.537
She knew things about you,

10:41.657 --> 10:43.417
like the box you were left in

10:43.537 --> 10:45.337
and the mole on your penis.

10:48.097 --> 10:50.217
Her name was Mary, she lived in

10:50.337 --> 10:52.497
a hippie commune in the country.

10:55.537 --> 10:58.017
That's the address.

10:58.177 --> 11:02.297
You have no idea how many times I
wanted to burn that piece of paper.

11:07.337 --> 11:08.937
How long will you be gone?

11:09.057 --> 11:10.377
I don't know.

11:13.017 --> 11:15.017
Come here.

11:17.217 --> 11:20.137
You be safe and you come home soon.

11:22.537 --> 11:24.537
We haven't got many days left.

11:26.457 --> 11:27.937
I don't want to be alone at the end.

11:28.057 --> 11:30.097
I know, Mum.

11:30.217 --> 11:31.897
None of us do.

11:39.257 --> 11:42.297
His Holiness feels in the
circumstances

11:42.457 --> 11:45.977
it would be wise to halt the
canonisation process.

11:46.097 --> 11:47.697
I'm being fired?

11:47.857 --> 11:50.497
Not at all.
The Day of Judgment draws near,

11:50.657 --> 11:54.297
Father Jude. The church has a task
of utmost importance

11:54.417 --> 11:56.217
to you. A task eminently suited

11:56.337 --> 11:58.617
to a man with your attributes.

11:58.777 --> 12:01.857
You mean my chronic punctuality
and sunny disposition?

12:02.017 --> 12:04.257
No, Father Jude,
your relentless cynicism,

12:04.377 --> 12:06.537
your wearying scepticism.

12:06.657 --> 12:09.097
Well, what's the gig?

12:09.257 --> 12:11.817
From now on you will be
investigating

12:11.937 --> 12:13.897
the second coming of Christ.

12:20.557 --> 12:22.957
My goodness, what an honour!

12:23.077 --> 12:24.907
No. No, no, not really.

12:24.930 --> 12:27.930
This it's what's known in the
business as a shit sandwich.

12:28.050 --> 12:29.810
It's a theological term.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.450
Celine, I'm the fall guy.

12:31.487 --> 12:32.967
I'm the patsy.

12:33.027 --> 12:35.233
"Father Jude, please robustly
test these,

12:35.233 --> 12:37.733
"but be a dear and do it
in a manner that involves

12:37.814 --> 12:41.174
"no robust testing in case one of
them is, you know, actually Jesus.

12:41.444 --> 12:43.684
"And even though the implications
are staggering

12:43.804 --> 12:45.164
"and way beyond your pay grade,

12:45.324 --> 12:47.824
"you're on your own,
so don't fuck it up."

12:47.858 --> 12:51.138
So you are scared you will
accidentally anger the Messiah?

12:51.288 --> 12:53.588
No, I'm worried about that,

12:53.669 --> 12:56.789
but what I'm scared
of is much worse.

13:00.594 --> 13:02.794
Sir, people need hope.

13:03.954 --> 13:05.474
What is Operation Saviour?

13:05.634 --> 13:08.514
Well... we don't know yet,
but you're announcing it tonight.

13:08.634 --> 13:10.114
That's it?!

13:10.274 --> 13:13.594
That's all you've got?!
What the hell are we paying YOU for?

13:18.194 --> 13:21.434
You think when Roosevelt green-lit
the Manhattan Project

13:21.554 --> 13:22.994
he knew the detail?

13:23.154 --> 13:25.914
You think when Kennedy promised
there would be a man on the moon

13:26.074 --> 13:28.514
by the end of the '60s
he had any idea how?

13:28.634 --> 13:30.634
Now these were great men.

13:30.794 --> 13:32.994
They announced the intention,
then made it happen -

13:33.114 --> 13:34.614
and that is what we are going to do.

13:34.674 --> 13:37.354
We are going to tell the world we
are going to save the world.

13:37.474 --> 13:39.714
And then we work out how we do it.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.421
How do we start?

13:42.541 --> 13:43.981
We can't do this alone, sir.

13:44.141 --> 13:46.461
So you get on the phone
to anyone that can help,

13:46.581 --> 13:48.181
our allies and our enemies.

13:48.301 --> 13:49.621
You ask for their best people,

13:49.781 --> 13:51.621
we put them in a room
with our best people,

13:51.781 --> 13:54.301
they tell us what they've got,
we tell them what we've got.

13:54.421 --> 13:56.021
And together they work it out.

13:56.141 --> 13:57.781
Are you insane?

13:57.941 --> 14:00.021
You want to share all of this
with the Russians?

14:00.141 --> 14:01.581
The Chinese? The Iranians?

14:01.701 --> 14:03.581
Yeah, starting tomorrow.

14:05.101 --> 14:07.061
Sir, the people need hope.

14:07.181 --> 14:08.541
Today.

14:12.341 --> 14:13.901
I'll start making the calls.

14:18.781 --> 14:22.901
Mr President, we're going to need
some time to do it this afternoon.

14:23.021 --> 14:26.101
Off the record. Very off the record.

14:26.221 --> 14:28.661
No-one else in this room can know.

14:40.581 --> 14:43.781
Morning, ladies, rise and shine.

14:46.621 --> 14:50.581
Listen, I know you're wanting
to stay off the grid and everything,

14:50.741 --> 14:53.421
but I really need to talk
to my husband and son.

14:53.581 --> 14:55.541
You see, my husband,
he's in the hospital,

14:55.661 --> 14:56.701
and I need to make sure

14:56.861 --> 14:58.701
that the doctors are still
showing up for work.

14:58.821 --> 15:01.061
I don't even know where my son is.

15:01.181 --> 15:03.341
So, really, it is very stressful.

15:03.461 --> 15:04.981
Rhonda, relax, OK?

15:05.101 --> 15:07.261
We have all the time in the world.

15:07.421 --> 15:09.901
Yeah, but we don't, do we?
We have 33 days.

15:10.061 --> 15:12.781
And I really want to spend
as many of those as possible

15:12.901 --> 15:14.021
with my family, so...

15:14.181 --> 15:16.581
You don't actually believe this
apocalypse stuff, do you?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.941
If we are in New Mexico and DC

15:24.101 --> 15:28.301
is north and east,
how come the sun is over there?

15:28.421 --> 15:30.981
We ain't heading north-east!

15:31.101 --> 15:32.781
I'm sure there's a perfectly...

15:32.941 --> 15:34.701
He said we're taking
the back roads,

15:34.861 --> 15:37.221
so maybe we're kind of going
in odd directions?

15:37.341 --> 15:39.221
Or they're lying to you.

15:39.381 --> 15:41.741
We don't know jack squat
about these two.

15:41.901 --> 15:44.221
How do you know they ain't
professional rapists?

15:44.381 --> 15:46.661
I don't think that's something you
can get paid for.

15:46.781 --> 15:48.981
Maybe we're better off on our own.

15:49.101 --> 15:50.181
I could steal us a car.

15:50.341 --> 15:52.941
We'd drive off in the sunset
like Thelma and Louise.

15:53.101 --> 15:55.621
OK. You know how that movie ends,
right?

16:06.581 --> 16:08.741
It's typical! Yeah.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.181
One announcement about the end
of the world

16:11.341 --> 16:13.461
and the entire country
grinds to a halt.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.981
It's chaos. Absolute chaos!

16:16.101 --> 16:17.821
It's very British chaos, though, eh?

16:17.981 --> 16:20.941
Everyone's queueing. Everyone's
still in that tarmac mind-set.

16:21.101 --> 16:23.141
I mean, we want to go over there,
yeah?

16:23.301 --> 16:26.421
So why don't we just go that way,
drive through the fields?

16:26.541 --> 16:29.021
I don't want to scratch my car.

16:29.141 --> 16:30.501
What?

16:30.661 --> 16:33.621
You're quite right,
we must protect the paintwork.

16:33.741 --> 16:35.701
Oh, God!

16:35.821 --> 16:37.781
Everyone just needs to relax.

16:37.941 --> 16:39.901
I mean, what difference
does it make?

16:40.061 --> 16:45.061
Get stressed, you die. Chill out,
you still die, more enjoyably.

16:45.181 --> 16:46.741
Right, so what's the plan?

16:46.861 --> 16:49.381
We find your... whatever.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.901
Vaginal mother, is that the
right...? Birth mother.

16:52.021 --> 16:52.941
She's my birth mother.

16:53.101 --> 16:55.661
Right, well, find out if she's still
at this commune. Then what?

16:55.781 --> 16:57.781
She tells me if I have a twin,

16:57.941 --> 17:00.981
and if so, which car park
she dumped him in.

17:01.101 --> 17:02.861
Maybe she knows where he is.

17:03.021 --> 17:05.661
If I can find him, I find Layla.
Hopefully.

17:05.820 --> 17:08.021
You really think he's got her,
like, hostage? Yeah.

17:08.141 --> 17:10.901
I don't know. Yes, I mean... Look.

17:11.021 --> 17:12.781
He's pulling her hair.

17:12.941 --> 17:16.101
I mean, that is pretty hostagey,
right?

17:16.221 --> 17:17.820
Yeah, or he's kissing her.

17:17.941 --> 17:19.381
No, he isn't.

17:19.501 --> 17:21.261
That's not how you kiss people.

17:21.421 --> 17:24.181
Maybe he's got her thinking
we are still happily married.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.741
I don't know, I just...

17:25.861 --> 17:27.461
I don't know what to think.

17:27.621 --> 17:29.741
The point is she is a damsel in
distress, yeah?

17:29.901 --> 17:32.301
Yes, exactly.
So every second counts.

17:32.421 --> 17:34.021
We are in a race against the clock.

18:06.061 --> 18:08.181
I'm serious, I've got a bad feeling.

18:08.301 --> 18:10.701
You trust me?

18:10.821 --> 18:12.381
My God, yes, yes!

18:12.501 --> 18:14.421
Just don't do anything drastic!

18:14.541 --> 18:17.981
Hey. Stop the ambulance right now.

18:18.101 --> 18:20.781
I said stop the ambulance.

18:20.941 --> 18:23.341
Oh, so what are we,
your hostages now?

18:23.461 --> 18:24.901
Is that it?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.221
You're kidnapping us?

18:26.341 --> 18:28.141
Hardly. We freed you.

18:28.261 --> 18:29.581
Ah! Are you crazy?!

18:29.741 --> 18:31.341
You know what,
that's exactly what I am,

18:31.501 --> 18:33.101
and I got the certificates
to prove it.

18:33.261 --> 18:36.581
You stop this ambulance
or I swear to God

18:36.701 --> 18:38.541
I will cut her throat.

18:38.661 --> 18:39.941
I think I'm bleeding.

18:40.061 --> 18:41.861
STOP THE FUCKING AMBULANCE!

19:11.166 --> 19:12.966
Max, you OK? I'm fine.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.486
Rhonda, you OK back there?

19:14.606 --> 19:16.246
I think so.

19:16.366 --> 19:17.806
I'm stuck!

19:17.826 --> 19:19.266
Get me out of here!

19:19.353 --> 19:22.209
Yeah, congratulations,
you nearly got us all killed.

19:22.210 --> 19:23.049
Happy?

19:23.113 --> 19:25.913
How about you spare me the
lecturing, get this off of me?

19:32.990 --> 19:34.990
Hey. HEY!

19:36.965 --> 19:40.325
Damn! We'll grab anything we can
eat and let's get out of here.

19:40.448 --> 19:42.688
Rhonda! Come on. Get me out of here!

19:42.807 --> 19:44.047
We'll be right back.

19:44.167 --> 19:46.847
Get me out of here!

19:47.008 --> 19:50.328
What about Leanne? What about her?
She just tried to kill you.

19:50.488 --> 19:53.808
What?
You want to see your family again?

19:53.968 --> 19:56.608
Because if so,
we need to move quickly and quietly,

19:56.767 --> 20:00.327
and that means not having an insane
Nazi drawing attention to us.

20:00.447 --> 20:02.807
Look around. No police.

20:02.967 --> 20:05.127
This is your best chance
of getting home,

20:05.287 --> 20:08.167
because sooner or later they're going
to get this back under control.

20:08.327 --> 20:09.807
We can't just leave her there
to die.

20:09.967 --> 20:13.607
Would the world be a worse place?
Maybe she had a tough childhood.

20:13.727 --> 20:16.407
I had a tough childhood! OK?

20:16.567 --> 20:18.767
My mum is nuts.
Didn't make me a racist.

20:22.527 --> 20:23.807
Get me out of here!

20:32.127 --> 20:35.887
Look... No offence,
but I don't know you, OK?

20:36.047 --> 20:39.327
I don't even know your real name,
so how do I know if I can trust you?

20:39.447 --> 20:40.527
Got it.

20:43.367 --> 20:48.087
It's Ariel, OK?
My real name, it's Ariel.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.127
Yes,
like the Little fucking Mermaid.

20:50.287 --> 20:52.087
Thanks, Mum!
Like I said, she's nuts.

20:53.887 --> 20:57.087
How about we just get an hour
down the road, I call 911,

20:57.207 --> 20:58.927
anonymously, report an accident,

20:59.087 --> 21:02.647
Leanne gets rescued but thrown
back in jail, we go on our way,

21:02.807 --> 21:05.247
and there's one less crazy racist
on the loose.

21:07.207 --> 21:08.167
Deal?

21:10.727 --> 21:12.087
OK. Deal.

21:22.167 --> 21:24.927
Why are you taking air fresheners?
We don't need air fresheners.

21:25.087 --> 21:28.287
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
I've never looted before. I just...

21:28.407 --> 21:30.447
I got a little grabby. OK. Um...

21:30.567 --> 21:31.767
I'll look for food.

21:38.367 --> 21:42.567
Bollocks! Look. We drive as far
as we can, and then we walk.

21:42.687 --> 21:44.167
Our forefathers managed it.

21:46.607 --> 21:49.247
What are you doing? Get off.
Uh-uh. Bucket list.

21:49.407 --> 21:51.687
I've always wanted to car-surf
like Teen Wolf.

21:51.847 --> 21:54.167
If this is the last of the petrol,
I want to make it count.

21:54.207 --> 21:57.767
Get off my car right now!
Mate, it's on the list. Why not?

21:57.927 --> 22:00.807
Because... you'll make us
less aerodynamic!

22:02.527 --> 22:04.727
Just get off, OK?
I'm not in the mood.

22:04.887 --> 22:07.047
Look, I love that we're
getting you out of your rut,

22:07.207 --> 22:08.887
and I will have your back
every time,

22:09.007 --> 22:10.567
but this is not just about you.

22:10.727 --> 22:12.887
You're not the only person
who's got stuff

22:13.007 --> 22:14.247
he wants to do before he dies.

22:14.407 --> 22:17.767
Right, yeah, OK, but my stuff
actually means something, doesn't it?

22:30.607 --> 22:34.967
The night before my dad's accident,
he took me to the video shop.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.687
I chose Teen Wolf.

22:39.407 --> 22:41.687
We cooked hot dogs
and watched the film...

22:43.207 --> 22:45.327
That was the last night
I spent with him.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.967
I didn't know that.

22:49.687 --> 22:52.127
I wanted to be Michael J Fox
so badly.

22:57.487 --> 23:01.447
♪ If everybody had an ocean... ♪

23:01.607 --> 23:03.527
Please don't fall off.
Please don't fall off.

23:03.687 --> 23:06.247
This is great!
Yesterday you were a bank manager.

23:08.447 --> 23:09.847
Hooray!

23:12.807 --> 23:15.527
Mate, I can't see! You realise
you haven't even had an egg today?

23:15.687 --> 23:18.487
First time in years, mate!
Seriously, I can't see!

23:18.647 --> 23:20.407
Admit it -
you feel alive, don't you?

23:20.527 --> 23:21.967
Yes, but please move!

23:22.087 --> 23:23.607
Say, "I don't know where I'm going."

23:23.727 --> 23:24.927
I DON'T know where I'm going!

23:25.047 --> 23:26.447
"And it makes me feel alive."

23:26.567 --> 23:28.567
And it makes me feel... Shit!

23:28.687 --> 23:30.567
Aargh! Oof.

23:32.767 --> 23:35.167
Oh, my God! Mate, you all right?

23:35.327 --> 23:37.087
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Are you sure?

23:37.207 --> 23:38.367
Yeah.

23:38.487 --> 23:40.047
What the hell are you doing?

23:40.207 --> 23:42.567
What does it look like
we are doing, huh?

23:42.687 --> 23:44.247
What are YOU doing?

23:44.367 --> 23:46.087
Car surfing. Always wanted to.

23:46.207 --> 23:49.127
Oh, bucket list! Snap!

23:49.287 --> 23:52.727
We're having an erotic odyssey.
Aren't we, dear?

23:54.247 --> 23:55.727
Erm...

23:55.887 --> 23:59.367
We need to get past, so...
Could you just...

23:59.487 --> 24:01.967
Can't you go round? There's room.

24:02.087 --> 24:03.327
Looks a bit tight.

24:04.447 --> 24:05.727
Couldn't you...?

24:05.887 --> 24:08.007
Young man,
you're being unreasonable.

24:08.127 --> 24:10.887
My husband's got arthritis!

24:11.007 --> 24:13.047
Stop staring. Stop staring!

24:13.167 --> 24:14.447
I don't want to!

24:22.327 --> 24:24.527
And we're out of petrol.

24:24.687 --> 24:26.447
Wonderful!
Looks like we're walking.

24:26.607 --> 24:28.527
You realise I can't get out my door,
right? Yeah.

24:31.487 --> 24:34.767
Sorry, slight mechanical issue.
Do you mind just ducking down?

24:34.887 --> 24:36.167
I just need to open my...

24:36.287 --> 24:37.207
Thank you.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.647
Oops! Sorry. Mind your bits.

24:45.847 --> 24:46.847
Thanks again.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.247
Lovely meeting you.
Enjoy the rest of your odyssey.

24:51.447 --> 24:54.807
Get me out of here, you cocksuckers!

24:54.927 --> 24:57.927
It says touch the red to the green.

24:58.087 --> 25:01.207
Well, I'm touching red to green,
and it's not working, dude!

25:01.327 --> 25:03.167
'Hey. You've got Spike's voicemail.

25:03.327 --> 25:05.527
'Hit me on the...'

25:05.687 --> 25:08.727
Spike, it's Mom. I can't go into
detail, but I'm coming home, OK?

25:08.887 --> 25:11.407
It's complicated,
and I don't know where you are.

25:11.567 --> 25:13.647
So leave your phone on
and I'll keep trying to call.

25:13.767 --> 25:16.287
I love you. I love you so much.

25:26.567 --> 25:27.567
McNeil.

25:27.687 --> 25:29.727
Hey, it's me. Who's me?

25:29.887 --> 25:32.807
Your sister.
Rhonda? It's a little... Bad time.

25:32.927 --> 25:34.367
Oh, really? I hadn't noticed!

25:34.527 --> 25:36.247
'Look, I haven't forgotten
about you, OK?'

25:36.367 --> 25:37.767
I'm going to come visit, I promise.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.567
Oh, yeah, I'm not in prison
any more. 'Really?'

25:40.687 --> 25:42.607
So the appeal worked? That's great!

25:42.727 --> 25:44.567
No, I kind of escaped.

25:44.687 --> 25:46.367
You what?!

25:46.487 --> 25:48.207
Rhonda, do you...

25:48.367 --> 25:50.527
You can't tell me that!
I'm in the White House!

25:50.647 --> 25:52.087
Scotty, shut up.

25:52.247 --> 25:54.207
'But if people found out
that you're a fugitive'

25:54.367 --> 25:56.807
and I knew,
they would throw the book at me.

25:56.967 --> 25:58.647
Scotty, if you want
to talk about problems,

25:58.767 --> 26:00.647
I'm pretty sure mine crap on yours.

26:00.807 --> 26:03.007
Please...
I'm your sister. Please help me.

26:04.887 --> 26:06.127
What do you need?

26:06.287 --> 26:08.207
'I need you to go to the hospital,
check Rajesh.

26:08.367 --> 26:11.207
'I need to know he's OK,
they haven't abandoned the patient.'

26:11.327 --> 26:13.047
And I need you to find Spike.

26:13.207 --> 26:15.687
I don't know where he is,
and I think he might be with Tim.

26:15.847 --> 26:18.647
Tim? That drunk is still alive?
'Apparently.'

26:18.767 --> 26:21.087
And the court gave him custody.

26:21.207 --> 26:22.567
I don't even know where he lives.

26:22.727 --> 26:25.487
I don't even know if Spike's
with him. I'm freaking out!

26:25.647 --> 26:28.087
Scotty!
What, are you jerking off in here?

26:28.247 --> 26:30.687
I got to go.
'No. Don't you dare hang up on me.'

26:30.847 --> 26:33.967
OK, yeah, so I will definitely
try and track down

26:34.087 --> 26:36.887
that information that you require.

26:37.007 --> 26:40.487
Thank you, Scotty. Thank you.

26:47.447 --> 26:50.527
You OK? Look like crap.
Well, thanks for the pep talk!

26:50.687 --> 26:53.367
Pleasure. You might want to consider
doing up your fly.

27:44.527 --> 27:46.447
I think you overreact. Really?

27:46.607 --> 27:49.807
Ask yourself what kind of person
claims to be a messiah.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.687
Catechism of the Catholic Church.

27:53.847 --> 27:58.527
Part 1, section 2,
chapter 2, article 7.

27:58.687 --> 28:01.447
"Before the second coming of Christ,
the Church..."

28:01.567 --> 28:03.007
"..must pass through a final trial

28:03.167 --> 28:05.007
"that will shake the faith
of many believers.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.567
"The persecution that accompanies
her pilgrimage on earth

28:07.727 --> 28:09.287
"will unveil the
mystery of iniquity

28:09.407 --> 28:10.967
"in the form of a religious deception

28:11.127 --> 28:13.287
"offering men an apparent solution
to their problem

28:13.447 --> 28:15.127
"at the price of apostasy
from the truth.

28:15.287 --> 28:18.687
"The supreme religious deception
is that of the Antichrist."

28:19.847 --> 28:21.407
You memorised the catechism?

28:21.527 --> 28:23.047
Ten years in the convent.

28:23.207 --> 28:25.487
I also know all the words
to Miss Saigon.

28:25.647 --> 28:28.607
Exactly! These are not
the skills that we need. Look...

28:30.127 --> 28:33.087
If everything that
we've devoted our lives to is true,

28:33.247 --> 28:38.207
then before Christ can return,
there will be a false messiah.

28:38.327 --> 28:40.647
An antichrist. Yes, I know.

28:42.047 --> 28:45.047
So, any one of these could be
Rosemary's actual baby.

28:45.207 --> 28:48.887
666, raised by jackals,
all of that '70s horror crap.

28:49.007 --> 28:51.047
I don't know if I have the chops.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.407
And I don't know
if I can protect you.

28:53.527 --> 28:55.407
Who said I need protecting?

28:55.527 --> 28:57.127
You're not scared? Of course.

28:57.287 --> 29:00.767
But I am more scared of NOT coming
face-to-face with the Antichrist.

29:00.927 --> 29:04.127
If the prophecies aren't true,
I waste my life, yes?

29:04.287 --> 29:08.447
So I pray for the Beast to come,
and I pray that we unmask him.

29:08.567 --> 29:11.407
God led me to your door.

29:11.567 --> 29:14.487
I won't let him down.
And I won't let you down.

29:16.287 --> 29:17.527
What if I let YOU down?

29:18.687 --> 29:20.167
It's OK.

29:20.287 --> 29:22.247
I have very low expectations of you.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.767
I look forward
to a new era of cooperation

29:29.887 --> 29:31.047
between our two countries.

29:32.527 --> 29:36.887
Well, China's in.
Your plan is proving very popular.

29:37.047 --> 29:40.367
Well, that's great, Mr President.
I'll get straight to the point.

29:40.527 --> 29:44.727
Operation Saviour is a diversionary
tactic to distract the populace.

29:44.887 --> 29:47.647
Are you saying it won't work?
We hope it will.

29:47.807 --> 29:50.967
But our calculations suggest
our chances are about one in three.

29:51.087 --> 29:52.647
Although for the sake of the people,

29:52.807 --> 29:54.607
you have to act
as if it's a sure thing.

29:54.767 --> 29:57.807
Hope, sir. Hope will keep them
in line until the very last moment.

29:57.967 --> 30:01.007
You want to dupe the American
people? If need be, yes.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.767
For as long as we need
to implement the fall-back.

30:04.927 --> 30:06.527
The fall-back? Sir...

30:07.687 --> 30:10.887
What we're about to tell you
is beyond top-secret.

30:11.047 --> 30:13.567
There is a bunker in the
Blue Ridge Mountains.

30:13.727 --> 30:18.407
It can keep 15 people and their
offspring alive for up to a century.

30:18.567 --> 30:22.167
Together with a DNA library of all
the major plant and animal species.

30:23.607 --> 30:25.007
We call it Mount Genesis.

30:26.407 --> 30:29.727
We built an Ark?
But for only 15 survivors?

30:29.887 --> 30:32.447
Who? We would hand-pick
a group of young women,

30:32.607 --> 30:35.047
selected for their skills,
intellect and fertility.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.807
No men? We don't need men, sir.

30:36.967 --> 30:38.847
We'll have a sperm bank.
We just need...

30:38.967 --> 30:40.167
uh, wombs.

30:41.367 --> 30:42.847
My God.

30:44.087 --> 30:45.647
This is monstrous! No, sir.

30:45.807 --> 30:48.447
It's a rational response
to an extraordinary situation.

30:48.567 --> 30:49.767
But if word ever got out...

30:49.927 --> 30:52.767
Oh, we'd be strung up.
So word can't get out.

30:52.887 --> 30:54.487
Not even to the First Lady.

30:57.087 --> 30:59.567
I need to think about this.
Sir, we don't have...

30:59.687 --> 31:01.407
I need to think about it.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.007
Yes, Mr President.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.607
They'd need a leader in there, sir.

31:34.706 --> 31:36.344
Well, this is it.

31:36.863 --> 31:38.173
You OK?

31:39.228 --> 31:40.628
Give me a second.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.153
I'm so caught up with Layla,

31:42.313 --> 31:44.353
I hadn't really thought this bit
through.

31:45.846 --> 31:48.366
What do you say to the woman
who gave birth to you, then

31:48.486 --> 31:50.046
left you in a shoebox?

31:51.016 --> 31:51.976
You'll work it out.

31:53.217 --> 31:54.177
Hello?

31:59.817 --> 32:00.777
Hello!

32:02.497 --> 32:03.857
What are you doing?

32:05.937 --> 32:07.737
You coming, or what?

32:11.937 --> 32:13.297
Hello!

32:17.857 --> 32:18.977
Hello!

32:19.137 --> 32:22.497
Who would live
in a house like this?

32:23.937 --> 32:25.137
No-one.

32:26.216 --> 32:27.816
Not for a very long time.

32:30.337 --> 32:31.537
The apocalypse is bollocks.

32:31.697 --> 32:34.337
You saw that store back there,
money's worthless now.

32:34.497 --> 32:37.097
They knew that would happen,
they want it to happen.

32:37.257 --> 32:40.297
The old system falls apart
then they regain control,

32:40.417 --> 32:42.017
and now it's a new system.

32:42.177 --> 32:46.817
A new capitalism, the slate wiped
clean, America back on top.

32:51.657 --> 32:53.457
When are you going to call 911?

32:57.577 --> 32:59.457
I said,
when are you going to call 911?

32:59.577 --> 33:01.337
You really think there's still a 911?

33:03.057 --> 33:04.417
You lied to me?

33:04.577 --> 33:10.577
But... She's going to die back
there. A horrible, painful, slow...

33:13.777 --> 33:19.817
OK, um, stop the car. Stop the car
now! You lied to me, Ariel!

33:19.977 --> 33:22.817
I did what needed doing.
Deal with it.

33:22.977 --> 33:25.617
My gosh, she was right about you
guys, wasn't she?

33:36.937 --> 33:39.937
Rhonda, stop.
Now, there's two ways we can do this.

33:40.097 --> 33:44.577
You, in the car, like a human.
Or you, in the trunk, like luggage.

33:44.697 --> 33:45.977
Your choice.

33:46.097 --> 33:48.657
Where are your taking me?

33:48.817 --> 33:52.777
Somewhere safe.
And totally off grid.

33:52.937 --> 33:56.697
You're going to show us every hack,
every trick in your locker.

33:56.857 --> 34:01.977
Now, I wanted to do this
in a friendly, consensual way,

34:02.137 --> 34:05.617
but you're making it very hard.
Frankly, I'm disappointed.

34:05.777 --> 34:10.137
We get you out of jail, but your
lack of gratitude disgusts me.

34:10.257 --> 34:13.137
Manners, Rhonda! Basic manners.

34:13.257 --> 34:15.737
I didn't ask you to spring me.

34:15.897 --> 34:21.777
You chose that.
And... FYI, I can't help you.

34:21.897 --> 34:23.056
What do you mean?

34:23.217 --> 34:25.976
I don't have any tricks
to my locker.

34:26.097 --> 34:28.456
I don't even have a locker! OK?

34:28.617 --> 34:31.976
You sprung the wrong person,
I didn't hack the NSA!

34:33.857 --> 34:35.496
So, why did you plead guilty, then?

34:37.496 --> 34:43.617
Unless you're protecting someone -
someone you love very much, right?

34:43.777 --> 34:46.976
Not necessarily. So it's either
the husband or the son.

34:48.697 --> 34:53.777
You leave my husband alone.
Nice try, but don't ever play poker.

34:53.937 --> 35:01.177
So, your son's the genius. What's
his name again? Spike? Spike McNeil.

35:02.977 --> 35:06.097
Bet we find him before you do.
You leave my son alone.

35:06.217 --> 35:07.777
You stay away from him!

35:07.937 --> 35:11.177
Or you'll call the police?
Max, pull over.

35:16.857 --> 35:19.777
You're going to shoot her?
God, no! I'm not an animal.

35:23.257 --> 35:27.857
You see, Rhonda, manners,
basic manners.

35:34.537 --> 35:38.137
I mean it!
You stay away from my son!

35:55.857 --> 35:56.937
You OK?

35:58.777 --> 36:04.097
Just got my hopes up. Should
have known. Back to square one.

36:04.257 --> 36:08.537
Oh, mate.
You are so far from square one.

36:08.697 --> 36:11.337
You know her name,
a previous address.

36:11.497 --> 36:15.657
We'll find Mary and we'll find Layla.
Besides, you had an adventure, dude.

36:15.857 --> 36:19.217
You lived a bit, you drove through
a field, broke into a house,

36:19.337 --> 36:21.817
ruined an erotic odyssey.

36:21.977 --> 36:24.257
Ticked something off
your bucket list?

36:25.417 --> 36:28.217
I didn't mean to be a dick
about that, by the way.

36:28.377 --> 36:31.257
I didn't know about your dad,
how much it meant to you.

36:32.497 --> 36:36.937
Actually, I made that up.
I just really wanted to car surf.

36:38.497 --> 36:39.977
And...

36:40.137 --> 36:43.177
Ow! Shit!
There's something in my arse. What?

36:43.297 --> 36:44.577
What's that?

36:46.057 --> 36:48.737
That's not good. It's like
what vets use on horses.

36:50.217 --> 36:51.377
Argh!

36:56.177 --> 36:59.897
Someone's shooting at us!
We've got to get out of here now!

37:00.017 --> 37:01.177
No, Dave...

37:03.257 --> 37:04.577
Dave, you got to...

37:06.737 --> 37:07.857
..fight...

37:07.977 --> 37:09.457
this mind...

37:11.177 --> 37:16.577
Stand by for transmission
in five, four, three...

37:19.177 --> 37:24.297
My fellow Americans,
yesterday I brought you tragic news,

37:24.417 --> 37:26.177
but today I bring you hope.

37:26.337 --> 37:29.537
I've spent this afternoon
in conversation with my fellow

37:29.697 --> 37:32.817
world leaders and this evening
I can announce an unprecedented

37:32.977 --> 37:36.257
international coalition
to counter the threat we face.

37:36.417 --> 37:39.617
'Tonight,
Operation Saviour begins...'

37:41.377 --> 37:43.217
Is somebody out there?

37:43.377 --> 37:45.257
'..the single biggest
scientific project...'

37:45.417 --> 37:47.177
Hey, somebody help me!
I'm stuck in this van!

37:47.337 --> 37:49.977
'It will also see mankind standing
together...'

37:51.537 --> 37:54.897
Get me out of here!
'..overcoming our differences...'

37:55.017 --> 37:56.977
About time, Judas.

37:58.697 --> 38:00.857
'..best scientists and engineers...'

38:02.897 --> 38:05.457
I'm real disappointed in you, hon'.

38:05.617 --> 38:10.297
I thought we was a team, but you
stabbed me in the back. Yeah, I did.

38:11.777 --> 38:15.097
But now I'm making it right.
So, we're done, OK?

38:18.777 --> 38:23.497
What are you talking about,
where are you going? Home.

38:23.657 --> 38:27.257
Really?
'..dedicated to Operation Saviour.'

38:27.417 --> 38:29.937
We have the resources,
the technology

38:30.057 --> 38:32.217
and the willpower to succeed.

38:32.377 --> 38:36.537
And I give you my word,
it WILL work.

38:36.657 --> 38:39.377
'It will go down in history...'

38:39.537 --> 38:44.737
Fine, stay. Don't say
I didn't warn you. What's he saying?

38:44.897 --> 38:48.897
Apparently, he's going
to save the world. Another messiah.

38:49.057 --> 38:53.977
Just what we need. 'So there is no
need to panic. Life goes on.

38:55.297 --> 38:58.617
'Tomorrow, you will go to work
and be paid for your labour.'

38:58.737 --> 39:00.377
Did you just put on the aftershave?

39:00.537 --> 39:04.577
'There will be food in our stores,
gas in our gas stations.'

39:04.697 --> 39:05.777
Sh.

39:05.937 --> 39:08.577
'This will be the single biggest
scientific project

39:08.697 --> 39:09.897
'ever embarked upon.'

39:24.937 --> 39:26.777
I can see your legs, babe -

39:26.937 --> 39:30.497
that sign starts, like, two feet off
the ground.

39:32.977 --> 39:34.337
Get in.

39:36.657 --> 39:38.817
Oh, love a duck.

39:40.737 --> 39:44.457
What, are you going to walk all the
way to DC in your prison fatigues?

39:44.577 --> 39:46.297
My shoulder is killing me,

39:46.457 --> 39:49.217
I can't drive this thing
for one more minute.

39:49.377 --> 39:52.217
I'm injured, you're useless,
we need each other.

39:56.297 --> 39:59.697
Well, that was easy.
Good, good, good.

39:59.857 --> 40:02.697
This is going to be fine,
like Driving Miss Daisy,

40:02.857 --> 40:04.737
only without all that
civil rights bullshit.

40:04.897 --> 40:06.977
Shut up!

40:09.497 --> 40:13.897
'..gas in our gas stations.
We've endured 24 hours of chaos.

40:14.057 --> 40:17.097
'But as of this moment,
the police are back in control.

40:18.177 --> 40:20.417
'All crime will be punished.' Ow!

40:20.537 --> 40:22.977
'If you looted, we will find you.

40:24.137 --> 40:28.217
'If you've escaped from prison, we
will hunt you down.' Floor it, babe.

40:28.337 --> 40:31.617
'Life continues as it always has.'

40:31.737 --> 40:34.057
I promise this is not the end.

40:34.217 --> 40:37.817
God bless you, God bless
the United States of America,

40:37.937 --> 40:39.217
and God bless humanity.

40:40.737 --> 40:42.897
We are all in this together.

40:43.017 --> 40:44.097
And we're clear.

40:47.297 --> 40:51.417
That was amazing, Mr President.
Just what the people needed, sir.

40:51.577 --> 40:58.857
That thing we talked about earlier?
Let's do it. Yes, Mr President.

40:59.017 --> 41:03.417
And, like you said, they're going to
need a leader. Won't they?

41:03.537 --> 41:05.177
Yes, they will, sir.

41:28.137 --> 41:33.137
Jamie. Jamie, please, wake up.
Mate...

41:35.137 --> 41:36.497
I think we're in trouble.

41:38.417 --> 41:40.737
What happened? Where are we?

41:40.897 --> 41:43.897
I don't know, but it's...
but it's all sort of horrible.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.217
I'm sure there's a perfectly
innocent...

41:55.257 --> 41:57.857
Well, hey, Ariel! Long time, no see.

41:59.017 --> 42:03.457
Now, um, give me one good reason why

42:03.577 --> 42:06.377
I shouldn't rip your balls off.

42:10.457 --> 42:13.257
She's not going to do it,
can see it in her eyes. Whoa!

42:13.377 --> 42:15.177
Sex is a natural urge.

42:15.297 --> 42:18.017
Well, I put a lid on it. I'M OK.

42:18.137 --> 42:19.577
What?

42:21.177 --> 42:22.417
Look out!

42:22.537 --> 42:23.777
Don't you move a muscle, missy.

42:23.897 --> 42:25.657
I see no evidence of a miracle.

42:27.617 --> 42:30.137
You know what? I love being a cop.

42:30.297 --> 42:33.403
Some guy says that you're
a terrorist. You're not, are you?

42:33.404 --> 42:34.489
So Spike's missing?

42:34.490 --> 42:36.347
Scotty, you have to find out.
How do you know my name?

42:36.417 --> 42:38.356
They call me the white horse.

42:38.357 --> 42:39.642
Shut up!

42:40.376 --> 43:10.485
