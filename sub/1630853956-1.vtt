05:21.973 --> 05:23.671
Ah! It's hot.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.457
Why such a hurry?

05:46.128 --> 05:47.782
I'm going to the old lab.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.778
Ugh... I hate this place.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.010
Careful up here.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.585
Look what I found.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.981
Enough Vesper,
my battery is low.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.987
Nobody forced you to come.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.468
You should have stayed home
to charge.

07:58.782 --> 08:01.306
You're wasting our time
on these experiments.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.582
Don't worry.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.541
It won't hurt.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.127
Thank you.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.261
Wait here.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.589
It's just a pilgrim.
Come on.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.651
-I think it's a "she".
-Leave it.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.426
One day, I'd like to follow one,

10:01.470 --> 10:03.690
find out where
they're taking all that junk.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.606
Don't.
They just wander until they die.

10:07.998 --> 10:10.131
-How do you know
they never come home?

10:10.174 --> 10:12.394
-Everyone knows it.

10:12.437 --> 10:15.310
How could anyone know
about all of them?

10:15.353 --> 10:18.313
Vesper.
She's not coming back.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.589
Is there anyone in there
with you?

10:36.679 --> 10:38.594
I think they're gone.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.901
I don't hear anything.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.818
Vesper, the tank!

11:59.457 --> 12:00.720
The power!

12:13.471 --> 12:15.691
Get the back up
from the fridge.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.302
I took it out...

12:19.477 --> 12:21.915
I needed space
for my cell cultures.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.449
I'll go to Jonas.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.123
Who is in charge?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.696
Who is in charge?

13:48.436 --> 13:49.524
Me...

13:49.567 --> 13:51.700
But they didn't attach the po...

13:53.441 --> 13:55.704
The Jug was your responsibility.

13:58.794 --> 14:01.144
Now put the poor creature
out of its misery.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.906
It's not human.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.690
It won't feel a thing.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.390
It was made in a lab.

15:48.512 --> 15:51.646
That Jug might have cost you
a fortune. What a waste.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.562
-What brings you, Vesper?
-You know.

15:54.605 --> 15:58.174
How would I? You're holed up
in that shack with my brother.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.916
Someone sabotaged our generator.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.135
Is that so?

16:03.179 --> 16:04.528
What a world.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.836
All our bacteria's gone.

16:08.532 --> 16:10.186
-We have no power.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.275
ll you know we can't do charity.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.713
I'm not asking for any.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.378
Believe me,
we work for it.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.991
Family has to stick together
to survive out here,

16:32.034 --> 16:36.865
especially with the Citadel
raising the price of seeds.

16:36.908 --> 16:39.302
Fortunately,
we have what they want.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.003
Skinny!

16:44.786 --> 16:46.744
Look who's come to see us.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.086
Your blood won't be young
for ever.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.699
Shame to waste it all
on emergencies like this.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.616
But of course,

17:33.530 --> 17:35.358
living alone as you do,

17:35.402 --> 17:37.273
you're lucky
it hasn't been worse.

17:37.752 --> 17:41.234
Pilgrims, drifters, bandits...

17:41.973 --> 17:43.540
They come to your door,

17:44.498 --> 17:46.500
and it can all end in tragedy.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.503
You'd be safer here.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.375
What about my father?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.986
We would take care of him.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.424
It's not his fault
your mother left.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.602
You'd both be more comfortable,

18:03.734 --> 18:05.519
especially during the winter.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.480
You remind me so much
of your mother.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.230
I hope you're not afraid of me?

18:24.364 --> 18:27.367
I'm not going to become just
another one of your breeders.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.590
You say it
like it's a dirty word.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.508
Think you're better
than everyone?

18:38.552 --> 18:40.162
I have skills.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.512
I taught myself.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.775
And one day I'll get out.

18:45.776 --> 18:46.734
But you...

18:47.778 --> 18:49.215
You'll still be here,

18:50.041 --> 18:52.087
sucking your kids' blood
to trade for seeds.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.351
My ambitious little girl.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.790
You know we are so alike,
you and I.

19:01.662 --> 19:05.492
Because we won't let this world
of shit crush us, will we?

19:10.584 --> 19:13.891
But don't think you can change
the order of things.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.984
Take every opportunity
as it comes to you.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.434
Can I have my bacteria now?

19:35.739 --> 19:38.220
You'll have to come back
in two days' time.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.181
I need to sell your blood
to the Citadel, first.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.748
You know Papa won't survive
that long without energy.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.576
I wish I had some more to spare.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.192
No!

19:54.018 --> 19:56.195
No!

19:56.804 --> 19:58.588
No! No!

23:58.132 --> 24:00.526
You won't be mad anymore
when you see what I got.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.197
What is this?
Where did you get that?

24:20.241 --> 24:22.722
-Jonas gave me.
-For what?

24:24.027 --> 24:26.595
-What did you do to get them?
-Nothing.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.730
I just took them.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.601
Put them back
before he notices.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.386
No.

24:36.257 --> 24:39.260
They're mine,
and I'm going to unlock them.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.915
-Make them fertile.
-You know that's not possible.

24:41.958 --> 24:45.353
Once I do, the Citadel will
want me to work in their labs.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.703
They'll never let you
work inside.

24:47.747 --> 24:50.314
You're just afraid
that I'll leave, like Mum!

24:51.751 --> 24:53.448
Oh Vesper,

24:54.623 --> 24:56.886
you don't know
the cost of dreams.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.932
Shut up!

25:00.977 --> 25:02.544
-Your place is here.
-Shut up!

28:03.986 --> 28:06.119
I saw a wing-glider last night.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.165
Maybe it crashed.

28:13.866 --> 28:16.477
Wouldn't you want to help?
If it were you?

28:16.520 --> 28:18.609
Dump her back
where you found her.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.655
She's not our responsibility.

28:32.536 --> 28:35.365
Maybe she could help us.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.150
Oh, no...

28:37.193 --> 28:40.109
You think she's going to take us
to the Citadel.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.069
These people do not act
out of kindness.

28:44.635 --> 28:46.768
What does she have to gain
by bringing you?

28:47.377 --> 28:48.552
Maybe...

28:49.379 --> 28:51.599
-The labs.
-Nothing.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.863
Do you want to blow us up?

28:54.907 --> 28:56.996
Would you prefer
that I left her there to die?

28:57.648 --> 28:58.606
Yes!

29:22.673 --> 29:24.066
Where is the man I was with?

29:25.154 --> 29:26.329
You were alone.

29:28.288 --> 29:31.073
I need to find him.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.988
He might be injured,
our glider crashed.

29:33.032 --> 29:35.034
Can you take me
to where you found me?

29:37.036 --> 29:38.777
You're not going
to get very far.

29:47.394 --> 29:48.699
Can you help me?

29:50.876 --> 29:52.529
Can you help me?

30:02.322 --> 30:03.802
You can go.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.674
You can get help.
You can search for him.

30:06.717 --> 30:09.155
We're not your servants.

30:09.198 --> 30:12.941
-Yes. Please forgive my manners.

30:12.985 --> 30:15.770
The man is my father
and I'm scared for him.

30:16.379 --> 30:19.208
Any help you provide
will not go unrewarded.

30:19.252 --> 30:20.949
We have helped.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.386
Did you call the Citadel?
Are they coming?

30:23.430 --> 30:24.910
I don't know.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.999
I fell from the glider
before it crashed.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.696
-Pap.
-No!

30:28.739 --> 30:30.393
You can't stop me.

30:30.437 --> 30:33.527
Do what you want,
but don't come crying to me.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.660
I'm Camellia.

30:38.053 --> 30:39.185
Vesper.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.796
You will not regret helping us.

30:42.492 --> 30:43.754
You have my word.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.800
We'll start at sunrise.

30:46.453 --> 30:49.282
-It's not safe at night.
-Thank you.

31:27.755 --> 31:29.539
I gave you the juiciest ones.

31:38.809 --> 31:39.854
Thank you.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.428
Who lives here with you?

31:49.385 --> 31:51.866
Just... me and Pap.

31:52.823 --> 31:56.349
The... cranky drone.

31:58.133 --> 32:00.614
He uses it to communicate.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.703
What happened to him?

32:03.878 --> 32:06.489
He got hurt,
serving for the...

32:07.142 --> 32:08.709
Citadel's army.

32:10.015 --> 32:13.627
All they gave him
was that old scrap drone.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.803
If we brought you both
to the Citadel,

32:15.846 --> 32:17.631
I'm sure they could help him.

32:17.674 --> 32:19.415
Really? You...

32:20.329 --> 32:21.765
You could do that?

32:21.809 --> 32:22.723
Um-hum.

32:23.985 --> 32:26.335
My father is
a very influential man.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.773
You hear that Pap?

32:32.167 --> 32:33.212
Pap?

32:41.176 --> 32:44.005
Pap, Pap, Pap!

32:44.049 --> 32:46.616
-Stop!

32:46.660 --> 32:47.966
Pap, no.

32:48.009 --> 32:51.317
Pap! Pap! Pap!

32:52.144 --> 32:55.234
No, stop. Stop it! Pap!

32:55.756 --> 32:58.628
-Stop, Pap.

32:58.672 --> 33:01.718
Stop, Pap. Please. Stop!

33:01.762 --> 33:04.460
-Please, stop.
-Keep hold of him.

33:29.137 --> 33:30.704
He's sleeping now.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.485
What did she do to you?

34:12.528 --> 34:13.921
I don't know.

34:15.966 --> 34:18.273
Can everyone
from the Citadel do that?

34:18.317 --> 34:19.579
I don't think so.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.625
Lucky she was there.

34:24.584 --> 34:26.020
She's awake now.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.259
Vesper?

36:14.781 --> 36:17.349
I expected to find pilgrims.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.876
This man needs help.

36:25.270 --> 36:28.186
-Good to see you, Darius.
-Jonas.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.188
I see you got your power back.

36:31.493 --> 36:33.843
I found backup supply.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.715
How fortunate.

36:37.151 --> 36:38.892
We still owe you for that blood.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.460
You should come and see us.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.036
Bring me...

36:54.734 --> 36:55.952
Bring me...

37:03.133 --> 37:06.398
Why has no one from the Citadel
come to find you?

37:06.833 --> 37:08.095
Camel...

37:10.184 --> 37:11.620
Close blinds...

37:15.407 --> 37:17.017
Lay with me.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.545
I've always wondered...

37:25.982 --> 37:28.550
What do you do
with my children's blood?

37:31.771 --> 37:34.556
Do you use it
to make your own more special?

37:47.221 --> 37:48.135
Help.

37:49.702 --> 37:50.703
Please.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.406
You're suffering?

38:03.324 --> 38:05.544
-Now you know how it feels.
-No!

38:07.676 --> 38:10.549
No! No!

38:11.985 --> 38:14.074
No! No!

38:16.294 --> 38:18.339
No! No!

38:21.429 --> 38:23.953
No! Let him!

38:28.393 --> 38:29.568
No.

38:30.395 --> 38:31.526
No...

38:32.310 --> 38:34.703
No. No...

38:47.368 --> 38:48.500
Take it apart.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.938
Salvage what's good.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.682
What's bothering you?

38:58.205 --> 39:00.425
Did this man
mean anything to you?

39:19.531 --> 39:21.184
There was another passenger.

39:33.588 --> 39:35.373
How did you find this?

39:38.854 --> 39:40.595
We were foraging.

39:41.204 --> 39:43.685
What, you just...
stumbled on it?

39:47.776 --> 39:49.430
-Why won't you look at me?

39:49.474 --> 39:51.693
Because she's afraid of you!

39:51.737 --> 39:53.260
Let's go, Vesper.

39:54.522 --> 39:55.741
No.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.047
You don't just leave.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.224
Not without helping
to clean up first.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.826
We say we didn't find anything.

40:37.870 --> 40:39.698
Can't lie to her for ever.

40:39.741 --> 40:41.961
Jonas is looking for her.

40:42.004 --> 40:44.964
It would be dangerous
if she did anything rash.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.966
We have to inform the Citadel.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.882
Jonas is the only one
with a transceiver.

40:49.925 --> 40:50.883
So?

40:52.058 --> 40:54.103
You've never snuck
into his farm before?

41:01.676 --> 41:02.982
Did you find him?

41:05.550 --> 41:07.290
We didn't find anything.

41:12.034 --> 41:13.383
But how...

41:14.384 --> 41:17.083
The wing-glider couldn't have
crashed so far away.

41:17.866 --> 41:21.653
The area is...
It's really big.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.135
We'll go tomorrow.

41:26.179 --> 41:28.660
We need to inform
the Citadel about the crash.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.446
Our neighbour has a transceiver.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.579
We'll go in the morning.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.234
Yes.

41:39.453 --> 41:40.715
All right.

41:42.325 --> 41:43.501
Let's do that.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.078
Your leg.

41:56.818 --> 41:58.777
You've almost stopped limping.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.213
Can I see?

42:05.044 --> 42:06.306
You made that?

42:07.394 --> 42:08.482
I did it for him.

42:09.570 --> 42:11.354
To protect his open sores,
but...

42:11.398 --> 42:14.096
It doesn't speed up
the healing process.

42:16.490 --> 42:19.754
I didn't know people here knew
so much about synthetic biology.

42:20.363 --> 42:22.757
The vermin have brains, too.

42:24.063 --> 42:25.325
This is nothing.

42:28.197 --> 42:31.200
-Come with me.
-Vesper, it's not safe.

42:31.244 --> 42:33.986
She needs to see my work
if she takes us to the Citadel.

42:35.335 --> 42:36.336
Let's go.

43:46.928 --> 43:49.801
The little ones always greet me.

44:18.307 --> 44:19.569
She likes you.

44:37.892 --> 44:40.155
This is the first one I created.

44:45.813 --> 44:49.599
He's sulking, because I haven't
been here for a few days.

44:51.732 --> 44:54.430
He is not the best looking,
but...

44:55.301 --> 44:56.694
He has character.

44:57.869 --> 44:58.957
Like Pap.

45:03.091 --> 45:04.310
Come on.

45:54.316 --> 45:57.929
They're safer here,
but I hope one day,

45:57.972 --> 46:00.888
they make their way out
into the world.

46:02.455 --> 46:04.762
I've never seen
anything like it.

46:07.895 --> 46:09.636
We have to show Elias.

46:10.202 --> 46:11.203
Who?

46:13.640 --> 46:14.772
My father.

46:16.382 --> 46:19.515
He's the synthetic biology head,
at the Citadel.

46:20.908 --> 46:22.692
He would love this.

46:23.693 --> 46:25.434
I'm still learning.

46:26.914 --> 46:30.222
The first ones
didn't even survive,

46:30.265 --> 46:32.311
or, they killed each other.

46:34.139 --> 46:36.054
But I'm getting closer

46:36.097 --> 46:38.970
to the right assembly
with each generation.

46:42.582 --> 46:44.627
I still make mistakes though.

46:46.934 --> 46:48.980
This one should be blue
like the others.

46:51.852 --> 46:54.072
Something must have changed
my original code.

46:56.814 --> 47:00.426
Let's find out why you don't do
what you're supposed to.

47:00.905 --> 47:04.125
We both know
I won't make it to the Citadel.

47:04.169 --> 47:07.781
But the kid trusts you.
It's everything to her.

47:37.767 --> 47:39.595
When did your mother pass away?

47:43.338 --> 47:44.644
She's not dead.

47:46.341 --> 47:47.734
She left us a year ago.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.563
Followed the pilgrims.

47:52.652 --> 47:54.393
Who are the pilgrims?

47:56.525 --> 47:58.223
They wander in groups

47:58.266 --> 48:00.616
with veils over their faces,
scavenging old junk.

48:02.967 --> 48:04.490
No one knows why.

48:05.447 --> 48:07.058
They don't talk.

48:07.841 --> 48:09.756
Why did she follow them?

48:11.845 --> 48:13.629
Pap said she dreamed too much.

48:15.675 --> 48:17.590
Got sad staying here.

48:22.073 --> 48:23.248
She...

48:24.989 --> 48:27.382
She scribed
these beautiful songs.

48:29.515 --> 48:31.691
When she sang,
it made me feel...

48:34.476 --> 48:35.608
Warm.

48:38.089 --> 48:39.786
One morning, I...

48:41.005 --> 48:42.223
I went to her,

48:43.268 --> 48:45.313
asking her to sing, but...

48:46.488 --> 48:48.012
She'd lost her voice.

48:50.797 --> 48:52.581
Two days later she was gone.

49:00.459 --> 49:02.069
Some people say...

49:03.070 --> 49:06.595
That it's a virus
that makes them pilgrims.

49:08.119 --> 49:10.686
She'd never have left you
if she had a choice.

49:24.831 --> 49:26.528
What about yours?

49:32.447 --> 49:33.666
I never met her.

49:37.104 --> 49:38.845
Maybe it's better like that.

50:29.243 --> 50:30.679
Do they exist for real?

50:32.333 --> 50:34.031
They did, a long time ago.

50:35.771 --> 50:39.906
Is it true that
the Citadel can generate any...

50:39.949 --> 50:41.603
-Any life form?
-Hm.

50:48.219 --> 50:50.351
-Have you ever seen this one?
-Um-hum.

50:51.526 --> 50:54.007
That's a cat.
They're very independent.

50:55.269 --> 50:57.010
Does it make a sound?

50:59.099 --> 51:00.013
Yeah.

51:07.064 --> 51:09.588
-What about this one?
-That's an owl.

51:09.631 --> 51:12.156
They fly and they go...

51:26.083 --> 51:29.347
-This one?
-That's a parrot.

51:29.390 --> 51:31.653
They repeat everything you say.

51:32.393 --> 51:33.786
-What?
-What?

51:34.743 --> 51:36.702
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

51:36.745 --> 51:39.096
-Oh, I get it.
-Oh, I get it.

51:40.358 --> 51:41.924
-Stop now.
-Stop now.

51:41.968 --> 51:43.274
-Stop.
-Stop.

51:44.013 --> 51:46.842
-Stop it. Stop it now.
-Stop it. Stop it now.

51:46.886 --> 51:48.279
-Stop.
-Stop.

51:48.670 --> 51:50.716
-Stop, Camellia.
-Stop, Camellia.

51:50.759 --> 51:54.241
-Stop it. Stop it.
-Stop it. Stop it.

51:54.285 --> 51:57.505
-Stop. Actually stop.
-Stop. Actually stop.

51:57.549 --> 51:59.551
-Stop. Stop.
-Stop. Stop.

52:05.252 --> 52:06.819
This is a wolf.

52:07.254 --> 52:08.951
They travel in packs.

52:08.995 --> 52:12.303
And they like
to howl at the moon.

52:46.902 --> 52:50.167
Why is the Citadel so closed-off
to people like us?

52:54.127 --> 52:57.391
If they opened its doors to all,
there'd not be enough resources.

53:00.177 --> 53:01.526
But...

53:01.569 --> 53:04.790
You're creating Jugs
to serve you.

53:06.444 --> 53:08.141
We could do their work.

53:10.839 --> 53:12.711
The Citadel likes control.

53:13.668 --> 53:15.714
Jugs are designed to be loyal.

53:17.411 --> 53:19.239
It wouldn't be so easy
with humans.

53:58.626 --> 54:00.149
Hum something.

55:14.398 --> 55:16.356
He'll be busy with them.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.315
I'll check if it's clear.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.817
Come on in, Vesper.

55:56.048 --> 55:58.485
The gyroscope wasn't
working properly.

55:59.094 --> 56:00.531
I'm fixing it for you.

56:06.450 --> 56:08.539
What brings you two here?

56:14.240 --> 56:15.197
Vesper.

56:17.461 --> 56:19.767
Why are you trespassing
on my farm?

56:21.943 --> 56:25.251
We came to get what you owe us,
for the blood.

56:25.294 --> 56:27.558
Well there's no need
to sneak through the back.

56:28.210 --> 56:30.387
Last time,
your kids threw rocks at me.

56:31.257 --> 56:33.128
Things have been
a bit tense here.

56:35.348 --> 56:38.133
A few days ago, our germinating
seeds disappeared...

56:39.178 --> 56:40.658
Skinny was watching them.

56:41.789 --> 56:43.704
He said that bugs took them.

56:44.879 --> 56:45.880
Imagine?

56:50.450 --> 56:53.322
I had to send him away
to think about that.

56:56.282 --> 56:58.110
If you can't trust
your family...

57:04.159 --> 57:06.640
Do you really think
bugs stole those seeds?

57:10.296 --> 57:11.428
Hold here.

57:21.699 --> 57:24.832
If I caught a bug stealing
from my family's stockpile,

57:25.529 --> 57:27.269
I'd tear off his wings,

57:28.140 --> 57:30.316
each little tiny leg.

57:40.282 --> 57:42.328
And what about
the extra passenger?

57:44.373 --> 57:45.679
You've seen anything?

57:49.814 --> 57:52.730
I have lost all patience
with liars.

57:57.691 --> 57:59.606
The drone is as good as new.

58:05.133 --> 58:07.396
But we don't do charity here.

58:47.393 --> 58:48.699
Are you hungry?

59:08.283 --> 59:09.633
Can you fly?

59:18.119 --> 59:19.686
What did he do to you?

59:21.514 --> 59:22.602
Fly one more time.

1:00:51.865 --> 1:00:53.432
-No!

1:01:03.790 --> 1:01:04.791
No! No!

1:01:31.775 --> 1:01:33.124
What happened?

1:01:37.911 --> 1:01:39.260
Vesper?

1:01:45.353 --> 1:01:47.094
Did you contact the Citadel?

1:01:53.971 --> 1:01:55.363
Vesper.

1:02:02.501 --> 1:02:04.590
-Hey, just take a moment.
-No!

1:02:06.461 --> 1:02:08.028
-Vesper!
-No.

1:02:20.693 --> 1:02:23.740
-What if it can't be fixed?
-Of course it can.

1:02:25.524 --> 1:02:26.699
You'll find a way.

1:02:28.179 --> 1:02:28.962
I promise.

1:02:30.007 --> 1:02:32.357
And then we can go
look for Elias

1:02:33.097 --> 1:02:36.622
because I'm feeling
so much better. Hm?

1:02:40.408 --> 1:02:41.714
He's dead.

1:03:03.388 --> 1:03:04.563
Show me.

1:03:37.639 --> 1:03:40.033
No, no, no!

1:03:41.165 --> 1:03:42.644
No, no, no!

1:03:50.391 --> 1:03:51.915
No, no, no!

1:04:46.230 --> 1:04:47.448
You're a...

1:04:48.101 --> 1:04:49.363
I'm a Jug, yeah.

1:04:52.932 --> 1:04:55.674
But, I've seen a Jug before...

1:04:56.980 --> 1:04:58.807
It wasn't like you.

1:04:58.851 --> 1:05:00.592
He created me.

1:05:02.072 --> 1:05:03.377
I'm different.

1:05:06.815 --> 1:05:08.861
You can't get us
into the Citadel.

1:05:10.863 --> 1:05:13.387
We were escaping the Citadel
when we crashed.

1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:18.218
Creating an intelligent Jug
is a major crime.

1:05:18.827 --> 1:05:20.003
They'd kill me.

1:05:22.135 --> 1:05:24.137
Elias made a deal

1:05:24.181 --> 1:05:26.879
with another Citadel
for refugee status.

1:05:28.663 --> 1:05:30.796
You were never going to take us.

1:06:08.486 --> 1:06:10.749
Get cleaned up. Go!

1:07:20.558 --> 1:07:23.648
Vesper, I'm sorry.

1:07:27.956 --> 1:07:30.220
I never felt so worthless.

1:07:42.667 --> 1:07:43.668
Try to fly.

1:07:47.019 --> 1:07:48.673
You can't stay here.

1:07:48.716 --> 1:07:50.283
Jonas marked you.

1:07:50.805 --> 1:07:52.894
He thinks you belong to him now.

1:07:54.505 --> 1:07:56.159
We're not going anywhere, Pap.

1:07:59.466 --> 1:08:00.815
She's a Jug.

1:08:03.383 --> 1:08:04.689
She lied to us.

1:08:07.735 --> 1:08:09.302
You were right.

1:08:12.349 --> 1:08:14.699
I'm going to take her to Jonas.

1:08:15.874 --> 1:08:18.442
Then maybe he'll go easier
on me.

1:08:19.791 --> 1:08:21.575
Don't be too hard on her.

1:08:21.619 --> 1:08:23.751
Jugs obey their masters.

1:08:24.491 --> 1:08:26.406
She didn't have a choice.

1:09:42.961 --> 1:09:44.615
Stop!

1:10:08.813 --> 1:10:11.250
I don't exist anymore.

1:10:13.948 --> 1:10:17.343
You don't just get to give up
when things are hard.

1:10:19.389 --> 1:10:21.347
They're hard for all of us,

1:10:22.130 --> 1:10:23.349
but we stay,

1:10:25.656 --> 1:10:27.397
and we help each other.

1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:38.669
Follow me.

1:10:51.116 --> 1:10:52.160
Sit.

1:10:56.252 --> 1:10:59.255
I found out why it wasn't doing
what it was supposed to.

1:11:00.517 --> 1:11:04.347
It's met a fungus
with an orange pigment.

1:11:05.348 --> 1:11:09.221
They joined
and made something new.

1:11:10.962 --> 1:11:13.443
If a flower can change
its purpose,

1:11:14.095 --> 1:11:15.271
so can you.

1:11:30.895 --> 1:11:31.809
What?

1:11:35.813 --> 1:11:37.597
Could I study a sample of you?

1:12:03.754 --> 1:12:04.668
Camellia?

1:12:06.409 --> 1:12:07.627
Camellia?

1:12:19.726 --> 1:12:21.337
See this part here.

1:12:22.555 --> 1:12:24.122
It keeps repeating,

1:12:24.165 --> 1:12:26.559
but it doesn't belong
to your core DNA.

1:12:30.084 --> 1:12:32.260
-What is it?
-It's locked.

1:12:32.957 --> 1:12:34.872
Elias didn't tell me anything.

1:12:55.066 --> 1:12:57.155
I used to play for Elias
when he was working,

1:12:57.198 --> 1:12:59.200
he said
it helped him concentrate.

1:13:00.027 --> 1:13:02.073
He was in a Citadel lab.

1:13:03.466 --> 1:13:06.077
With their technology,
this would be easy.

1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:08.384
You wouldn't like it
in the Citadel.

1:13:11.691 --> 1:13:14.302
Elias used to say life there
was like a frozen river,

1:13:14.346 --> 1:13:16.043
the surface was beautiful,

1:13:17.393 --> 1:13:18.655
but underneath...

1:13:21.309 --> 1:13:23.573
Everyone tries to live for ever,

1:13:23.616 --> 1:13:25.575
and it's a joyless
and a lonely life.

1:13:26.489 --> 1:13:27.751
You lived there.

1:13:29.796 --> 1:13:31.189
I lived for Elias.

1:13:34.758 --> 1:13:37.021
I entertained him,
I took care of him.

1:13:39.632 --> 1:13:41.721
I let him take care of me.

1:13:45.899 --> 1:13:47.423
I kept him warm,

1:13:48.293 --> 1:13:49.555
I helped him sleep...

1:13:57.781 --> 1:13:59.652
I did everything he told me to.

1:14:54.272 --> 1:14:55.316
Camellia?

1:14:57.580 --> 1:14:59.756
No. Keep playing.

1:15:07.024 --> 1:15:09.635
There, that last note,
keep playing that.

1:15:25.608 --> 1:15:27.087
Look.

1:15:28.959 --> 1:15:32.136
These,
the DNA sequences of plants...

1:15:33.659 --> 1:15:36.357
There are so many,
I don't get it.

1:15:38.490 --> 1:15:39.665
Wait.

1:16:19.270 --> 1:16:20.445
Pap!

1:16:25.972 --> 1:16:28.888
I found the key
to unlock the Citadel seeds.

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:31.587
I can make them fertile.

1:16:32.544 --> 1:16:34.154
We'll never starve again.

1:16:37.636 --> 1:16:39.420
So that was his plan:

1:16:40.421 --> 1:16:43.599
to trade them for entrance
to the other Citadel.

1:16:44.469 --> 1:16:46.863
You need
to take Vesper there tomorrow.

1:16:48.038 --> 1:16:49.517
-No.
-Vesper.

1:16:49.561 --> 1:16:50.910
-Pap.
-You...

1:16:50.954 --> 1:16:52.782
I'm not leaving you.

1:16:52.825 --> 1:16:56.655
You don't understand,
the Citadel will be ruthless.

1:16:56.699 --> 1:17:00.354
I need new filters.
We have to go to the old lab.

1:17:17.284 --> 1:17:19.765
You won't believe
what I'm about to do.

1:18:10.860 --> 1:18:14.254
I'm so relieved
to finally find you, Miss.

1:18:14.298 --> 1:18:15.560
And you are?

1:18:17.954 --> 1:18:19.651
Where are my manners?

1:18:20.913 --> 1:18:22.741
My name is Jonas.

1:18:25.265 --> 1:18:26.745
I'm his brother.

1:18:31.881 --> 1:18:33.883
If you come back with me,

1:18:34.405 --> 1:18:36.581
I can help get you home.

1:18:36.624 --> 1:18:39.671
We've contacted the Citadel,
they're on their way.

1:18:41.673 --> 1:18:43.806
Either you're mistaken, or...

1:18:47.331 --> 1:18:49.333
Someone isn't truth-telling.

1:18:54.164 --> 1:18:58.734
I'm the only person in this area
with a transceiver.

1:19:00.605 --> 1:19:02.694
You have to be really careful

1:19:04.565 --> 1:19:06.306
who you trust.

1:19:08.134 --> 1:19:09.614
My place is more...

1:19:10.615 --> 1:19:12.748
appropriate for a lady.

1:19:13.923 --> 1:19:17.317
It's bigger, more comfortable.

1:19:23.846 --> 1:19:25.717
It doesn't smell of death.

1:19:29.503 --> 1:19:32.028
I'll go with you.

1:20:10.066 --> 1:20:11.719
Unbelievable!

1:20:15.636 --> 1:20:17.508
You're practically human.

1:20:20.598 --> 1:20:23.862
-A Jug needs a master.
-I have one.

1:20:23.906 --> 1:20:26.691
-Not anymore, you don't.

1:21:00.203 --> 1:21:01.726
You think I'm stupid?

1:21:10.082 --> 1:21:13.085
Vesper stop! Stop that! Stop it!

1:21:17.873 --> 1:21:19.613
No, no, don't.

1:21:19.657 --> 1:21:21.267
Jonas, no!

1:21:26.707 --> 1:21:27.665
Drop it.

1:21:51.254 --> 1:21:53.038
So this is how it ends.

1:22:20.283 --> 1:22:21.980
I want to make a deal.

1:23:06.372 --> 1:23:08.679
Camellia's owner was
an engineer.

1:23:11.769 --> 1:23:15.642
He hid the codes to
unlock the seeds inside her DNA.

1:23:24.738 --> 1:23:26.653
I can make them fertile.

1:23:39.057 --> 1:23:41.625
We'll both have
all the food we need.

1:24:10.654 --> 1:24:12.917
I found the Jug
you're looking for.

1:24:19.054 --> 1:24:21.404
This will mix
with the seeds' cells

1:24:21.447 --> 1:24:23.580
and change their DNA.

1:24:23.623 --> 1:24:25.060
How long will it take?

1:24:58.354 --> 1:24:59.703
It worked.

1:25:02.793 --> 1:25:06.101
This little one
can change our entire lives.

1:25:30.777 --> 1:25:32.605
Away from the window.

1:25:55.237 --> 1:25:56.499
Vesper...

1:26:27.530 --> 1:26:28.748
Leave it.

1:27:02.217 --> 1:27:03.696
Don't breathe it.

1:27:24.587 --> 1:27:26.545
They'll be here soon.

1:27:27.459 --> 1:27:28.721
I'll turn myself in.

1:27:30.332 --> 1:27:32.377
It's too late for that.
They know we've helped you.

1:27:32.421 --> 1:27:34.161
You and Vesper have to go now.

1:27:34.205 --> 1:27:34.988
No!

1:27:36.381 --> 1:27:38.340
-We're not leaving you here.
-Don't argue.

1:27:38.383 --> 1:27:40.820
I can buy you
enough time to escape.

1:27:46.609 --> 1:27:48.350
Look at me.

1:27:53.398 --> 1:27:57.272
You and Camellia must go
to the Citadel in the south.

1:27:57.315 --> 1:27:59.056
Trade the seeds for safety.

1:27:59.099 --> 1:28:01.711
No, I don't want any of this.

1:28:02.712 --> 1:28:04.714
I'll give them the seeds.

1:28:04.757 --> 1:28:06.759
It doesn't work that way.

1:28:06.803 --> 1:28:08.631
I'm not leaving you here.

1:28:10.415 --> 1:28:11.634
Vesper.

1:28:13.984 --> 1:28:15.507
How about this?

1:28:17.379 --> 1:28:18.597
We'll trick them.

1:28:22.601 --> 1:28:25.735
You'll hide in the swamp
and I'll tell them you're gone,

1:28:26.475 --> 1:28:28.694
and when it's over
you can come back.

1:28:29.913 --> 1:28:34.091
I've worked for these people.
I know how to talk to them.

1:28:36.354 --> 1:28:37.399
Besides,

1:28:38.922 --> 1:28:41.316
how can they hurt me any more?

1:28:43.622 --> 1:28:45.885
We could hide you from them,
too.

1:28:45.929 --> 1:28:47.234
There you go.

1:28:49.759 --> 1:28:51.543
That's a great idea.

1:29:11.346 --> 1:29:13.391
Promise you'll take care of her.

1:31:58.817 --> 1:32:01.080
No, no.

1:32:01.124 --> 1:32:03.605
No! No!

1:32:05.171 --> 1:32:09.480
-I'm sorry. Come.
-No!

1:32:09.524 --> 1:32:11.830
-Come here. I'm sorry.
-No, no!

1:32:14.529 --> 1:32:16.531
No. No.

1:32:16.922 --> 1:32:18.750
He'll always be with you.

1:32:20.143 --> 1:32:22.841
-He'll always be with you.

1:32:22.885 --> 1:32:23.842
Vesper.

1:32:25.322 --> 1:32:27.498
He told us to go to your garden,

1:32:27.542 --> 1:32:30.762
and then when it's safe
we go south to the Citadel.

1:32:30.806 --> 1:32:31.720
OK?

1:32:32.634 --> 1:32:33.896
Come on.

1:32:35.419 --> 1:32:36.942
Come on.

1:32:59.965 --> 1:33:01.401
Come on.

1:33:05.492 --> 1:33:06.493
Run.

1:33:10.019 --> 1:33:11.847
Don't touch the red grass.

1:35:46.697 --> 1:35:48.003
I'll go with you.

1:36:10.068 --> 1:36:11.461
Hey!

1:37:18.180 --> 1:37:20.356
They won't stop until they get
me.

1:37:23.489 --> 1:37:24.621
No.

1:37:25.013 --> 1:37:26.188
Pap said...

1:37:27.189 --> 1:37:28.886
We have to stay together.

1:37:29.844 --> 1:37:31.541
You can't just leave me.

1:37:35.893 --> 1:37:39.201
Vesper, do you remember
what you said about the seeds?

1:37:40.376 --> 1:37:43.858
How just one could change
everything?

1:37:43.901 --> 1:37:45.860
-No.
-Vesper.

1:37:45.903 --> 1:37:47.774
-You can't do this.
-It's OK.

1:37:47.818 --> 1:37:50.255
You're coming with me.

1:37:50.299 --> 1:37:54.564
You're going to stay with me,
and that is it!

1:37:54.607 --> 1:37:56.958
-You have to do what I say.

1:37:57.654 --> 1:38:01.701
It's an order, I'm ordering you,
and you will stay with me.

1:38:01.745 --> 1:38:04.269
-Vesper...
-OK? Come on. Come on.

1:38:04.313 --> 1:38:05.705
You're staying with me.

1:38:06.576 --> 1:38:09.579
You're going to stay with me,
OK?

1:38:09.622 --> 1:38:13.148
You're going to stay with me.
You're not going to leave.

1:38:13.191 --> 1:38:14.714
No. No.

1:38:15.367 --> 1:38:17.500
-Please.
-Vesper.

1:38:17.543 --> 1:38:21.069
-Please don't leave me.
-Shh.

1:38:21.939 --> 1:38:23.680
-Please.
-Vesper.

1:38:24.507 --> 1:38:26.248
-Please.
-Vesper...

1:38:26.291 --> 1:38:27.640
Please.

1:38:30.861 --> 1:38:33.951
Please stay with me.

1:38:52.491 --> 1:38:54.885
Have beautiful dreams.
