<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me...

00:02.585 --> 00:04.671
<i>Jesus, come on. Johnny's ex?</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:07.048
I was seeing this Wall Street guy,
but, uh...

00:07.632 --> 00:08.633
he's too possessive.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.135
So, you think, uh,

00:10.593 --> 00:12.345
he would mind if we, you know...

00:13.596 --> 00:15.515
- got dinner sometime?
- Oh, Tommy.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.476
I know you have some secret evil plan
in mind, and you know what?

00:18.476 --> 00:22.564
I've grown too mature for that old school,
old neighborhood type of bullshit.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.941
If you stay in your house
no matter what you do

00:24.941 --> 00:28.403
no matter how long you're there,
you're always gonna be the probie.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.488
You gotta get out, Mike.

00:31.906 --> 00:32.949
What are you doing?

00:33.324 --> 00:34.659
- What?
- What are you kissing me for?

00:35.493 --> 00:38.204
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- Why would you think that?

00:38.204 --> 00:39.873
I don't know, you're all gay and crying.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.750
- I thought I'd take a shot.
- I wasn't crying, okay.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.003
Listen, Tommy, including Garrity,
I got four guys in line right now.

00:45.336 --> 00:46.337
No, five.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.340
Maggie, I just-- I'm not gonna play
fifth fiddle to anyone.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.801
You told me if I told you the truth,
you wouldn't get mad.

00:51.801 --> 00:52.927
I lied. How does it feel?

00:53.136 --> 00:54.846
What the hell are you doing?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.353
You want me to call you, or...

01:03.063 --> 01:04.064
Nuh-uh.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.524
I'll call you.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.194
I want us to be together forever.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.112
Oh, I'll see what I can do about that.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.530
- That chick I've been seeing.
- Yeah.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.199
She took my little girl, man.
She took Keela.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.325
Man! You didn't tell her

01:15.325 --> 01:17.869
- about the foster family--
- Yeah. It slipped out.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.788
How was I to know
she'd use it against me, huh?

01:19.913 --> 01:22.624
I-- I don't want you to call me,
it's over. We're breaking up.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.125
- You're-- you're breaking--
- Yes.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.003
Hey, you guys listening to this?
Garrity's breaking up with me.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.713
Who you calling a faggot, faggot?

01:28.713 --> 01:30.423
- You!
- No, you're the faggot.

01:30.423 --> 01:34.177
Yeah okay, Mr. Gay-faggot-guy
standing on this construction site.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.767
At least spend the night.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.270
It's five grand. It should help you, uh...

01:45.063 --> 01:46.231
Is everything okay?

01:47.982 --> 01:49.275
Look, it's not what you think, bud.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.401
I think it's...

01:50.777 --> 01:54.030
That's the most expensive piece of ass
you ever had, my friend.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.699
- I'm in.
- You're in?

01:57.033 --> 02:00.495
Yeah, what we talked about at the bar,
messing with Johnny and Janet.

02:00.703 --> 02:01.830
I think, it'll be fun.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.748
All right, bye.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.142
Jesus.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.019
Huh.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.776
Yeah?

02:31.943 --> 02:33.361
Just a sec.

02:34.904 --> 02:35.905
Oh, my God.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.419
Hey.
Everything all right?

02:49.419 --> 02:50.587
Yeah, great. What you doing?

02:50.587 --> 02:51.796
- You-- you sure?
- Yeah.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.716
Oh, right. Hey, your old man, uh,
pissed the bed again.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.800
Cool.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.346
I, uh...

03:01.139 --> 03:03.308
was thinking of maybe taking a shit
on the floor.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.851
That's great. Great.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.811
You know, uh...
See you later.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.396
Maybe, uh...

03:09.189 --> 03:10.815
I'll just puke on the couch.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.820
Decisions, decisions.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.200
Hey.
Hey, Tommy.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.368
- How you doing?
- How's it hanging, eh?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.954
Hanging all right.
Who's talking to my probie there?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.290
Oh, that's Rocko.
He's off to Iraq next week.

03:27.415 --> 03:28.416
- Can you believe that?
- Yeah?

03:28.416 --> 03:31.711
- Brave kid, huh?
- Yeah, brave or stupid, one or the other.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.796
How's, uh, how's your probie?

03:34.839 --> 03:35.840
He's all right. Why?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.384
- J-- just asking.
- Yeah, yeah, "just asking,"

03:38.384 --> 03:40.970
Known you enough to know
"just asking" means anything but.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.098
I'll tell you what, he's a complete idiot,
but he's our complete idiot.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.601
Okay, got you. Okay, okay.
What's the nut on the game?

03:46.851 --> 03:48.561
What do you wanna do, 50 bucks a head?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.105
- So 400 bucks to the winning team.
- You got it.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.565
- Let's get it on, man.
- Yeah.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.442
"Let's get it on," what is this, 1977?

03:54.609 --> 03:56.486
'77, '78, you're gonna get yours.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.488
Big time.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.531
Let's go. What are you, 12? Let's go!

04:00.531 --> 04:02.700
You know the rules,
two points in the bucket,

04:02.700 --> 04:04.202
three points if you hit the bottle.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.787
I wanna just tell you right now,

04:05.912 --> 04:08.706
I want a round of applause here for, uh, Rocko.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.334
He's going to Iraq next week
to fight for our freedom.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.755
Now, uh, before he goes,
let's give him one last gift,

04:15.880 --> 04:18.132
a little good old-fashioned
American ass kicking.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.134
Here we go!

04:24.847 --> 04:27.141
Let's go.
It's mine, it's mine.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.853
- Watch the ball, watch the ball.
- What's with probie?

04:30.853 --> 04:34.190
Yeah, you know, Rocko's going over there
because it's for freedom.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.900
- Yeah, I understand.
- Your probie,

04:36.526 --> 04:38.987
he wants to transfer,
and it is his God-given right.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.659
Come on, yo, go. Let's get them.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.121
Get down there.
You're clear.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.165
Yeah. Yeah.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.545
Come on, let's go.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.423
I didn't see.
Yeah, I got in his way.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.678
I'm off now.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.515
What's going on?
Huh?

05:07.765 --> 05:08.850
You banging that guy?

05:10.059 --> 05:11.519
- I'm just being friendly.
- Yeah?

05:12.395 --> 05:14.105
Be friendly with somebody
on your own team.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.606
Asshole. Sit down.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.409
Come on. There you go.

05:26.826 --> 05:27.827
Yeah.
Whoo!

05:27.827 --> 05:29.037
Nice shot.
Hey!

05:29.287 --> 05:30.997
These guys got the rink in five minutes.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.206
All right, five minutes.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.666
- Next goal wins.
- All right.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.252
Come on, come on.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.545
Let's go, drive it down.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.923
Yeah. Yeah!

05:44.218 --> 05:45.428
Good stuff.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.139
What do you got for me?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.932
- Here's $400. Good game.
- Thank you.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.727
- I meant what I said about my probie.
- Yeah, well, so did I.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.146
- Yeah, hands off. Do me a favor.
- What's that?

05:55.146 --> 05:57.023
That's $200.
Give that to Rocko for his trip.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.359
- Yeah. Thank you. That's great.
- You're welcome.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.152
- Rematch next week?
- Yeah.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.945
- Oh, and, Tommy?
- Yeah?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.364
Bite me, man.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.707
<i>On another day
C'mon c'mon</i>

06:14.832 --> 06:18.127
<i>With these ropes tied tight
Can we do no wrong</i>

06:18.461 --> 06:21.464
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now it's gone</i>

06:21.631 --> 06:24.384
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

06:24.509 --> 06:27.720
<i>With my teeth bite down
I can see the blood</i>

06:27.845 --> 06:31.099
<i>Of a thousand men who have come and gone</i>

06:31.265 --> 06:34.435
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now it's gone</i>

06:34.435 --> 06:37.438
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

06:37.647 --> 06:40.691
<i>-Is it safe to say?
- C'mon c'mon</i>

06:40.691 --> 06:43.861
<i>-Was it right to leave?

06:43.986 --> 06:47.198

Hey, did we win?
Yeah, 200 <i>dineros.</i>

06:58.042 --> 07:00.711
- 200 Robert De Niro's, way to go.
- Thank you, boys.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.838
Yeah!

07:01.838 --> 07:03.714
Yeah, Daddy,
that's what I'm talking about.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.134
Probie, nice hustle out there today.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.593
Thanks.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.637
I need some ibuprofen.
You guys got any?

07:09.637 --> 07:13.683
Interesting, I have a bottle of ibuprofen
in my locker, waiting to be taken.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.476
- Really? Can I have some?
- Nope.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.936
It's for me and my friends.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.189
- Can we be friends again?
- No, you broke up with me, I'm sorry.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.109
- It's not that easy for me to recover.
- Come on, I'm in pain here.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.528
Well, I'm in pain too, okay?
Emotional pain.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.406
- Really?
- Yep, I was very, very hurt.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.199
I'm kidding.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.119
Take the brown ones.
Don't take the white or the red.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.872
- Why brown?
- Because brown is the ibuprofen.

07:36.038 --> 07:39.417
The red and the white one are leftover
from when I was addicted to pills.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.127
Why didn't you throw them away?

07:41.377 --> 07:43.463
- Because I'm sentimental?
- About pills?

07:44.046 --> 07:45.423
Sarcasm.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.175
Right, so, uh, the red, right?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.218
- Brown.
- Brown. Gonna take a brown.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.638
Tell me he's not color blind.
I hope not.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.726
Are you sure
there's not anything I can do?

07:56.934 --> 07:59.395
Honey, come on, look.
You handle the kids, right?

07:59.395 --> 08:00.980
You drive them to and from school,

08:01.147 --> 08:02.982
take them to their games,
do their laundry.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.776
- Actually, lately, you do the laundry.
- Yeah, right.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.987
But, you know,
you take care of everything else.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.865
I feel guilty being at work,
while you're doing things.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.034
I mean, the cooking's the least I can do.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.036
Besides, I enjoy cooking for you guys.

08:15.244 --> 08:18.122
 How the hell you and Tommy
came from the same house,

08:18.122 --> 08:20.082
I don't know, it's beyond me.

08:20.625 --> 08:24.128
You're always on time.
You come straight home from work.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.131
And I never have to wonder
where you are or what you're up to.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.383
What do you say?
Half a cupcake for Katy? Huh?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.385
She's been good at her homework.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.804
Yeah, okay.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.181
Yeah? Yeah, huh?

08:40.311 --> 08:41.312
Oh, yay!

08:41.687 --> 08:44.398
- What's the capital of Massachusetts?
- Boston.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.609
- Connecticut?
- Hartford.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.778
- California?
- Sacramento.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.571
You're a smart one, huh?

08:50.780 --> 08:51.781
Here you go, baby.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.993
- Listen...
- Mmm-hmm.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.621
I got about 10 minutes left
on my chicken and potatoes.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.166
I'm gonna go upstairs, talk to Colleen
about what happened at school.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.211
It is so not okay to slap your classmate
in the middle of class.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.295
I'll handle it.

09:06.295 --> 09:08.548
- She's out of control.
- Hey, I'll handle it.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.971
I like Uncle Johnny.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.305
- Yeah.
- He's so nice.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.058
He never gets mad, he never yells at us.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.436
And he never does that thing
that Daddy does,

09:22.687 --> 09:25.898
where he would say something
and then, like, a few seconds later,

09:25.898 --> 09:28.484
he would explain
that he didn't mean what he said.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.320
Oh, you mean sarcasm.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.073
- Yep, that's it.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.369
Yeah, Daddy's funny that way.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.585
Between the smoking can and the hockey,
we got almost two grand here.

09:45.876 --> 09:46.877
It's unbelievable.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.087
Why don't we call a truce?

09:48.087 --> 09:51.382
We all quit smoking, so we call a truce
and buy something we need.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.384
Microwave.
Boom box?

09:53.384 --> 09:54.927
- Microwave. That oven is so old
- What?

09:54.927 --> 09:56.679
it's leaking microwaves when it's not on.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.432
Soon, we're gonna grow
an extra pair of cock and tits.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.351
- Look at me, I'm halfway there.
- An iPod can hold 35,000 songs.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.395
35,000 Puerto Rican hip-hop songs.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.479
- Hey.
- No, thank you.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.648
Will you get me garlic out of the fridge?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.900
- Batting cage.
- Batting cage?

10:10.026 --> 10:12.111
I'm throwing words,
we get a batting cage,

10:12.111 --> 10:14.739
we win the tournament every summer,
I guarantee it.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.490
We need music.
I need a bra!

10:16.490 --> 10:17.700
How about new Halligans

10:17.700 --> 10:21.245
and that saw we were bitching
about the city not getting for us?

10:24.957 --> 10:27.752
I feel like a million bucks.
Thanks for that ibuprofen.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.004
They should make you take it
every morning.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.215
Vitamin I. Half hour ago I couldn't walk,
now I feel fantastic.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.634
Hey, look at this money.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.093
- How much is that?
- Two grand.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.137
Know what we should get? A batting cage.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.639
- All right, shoot me.
- Come on.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.557
We'd dominate the softball league
every summer.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.893
What are you gonna,
shoot me in the head?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.854
We need music.
Got a call from an inside source.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.275
Due to the recent bad press, vis-à-vis,
the sex scandal from that house downtown,

10:51.525 --> 10:54.362
they're sending over a crew
to confiscate all the dirty magazines,

10:54.487 --> 10:57.114
pornographic tapes, DVDs,
as well as all computers

10:57.114 --> 10:59.700
that might contain traces
of pornographic sites.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.286
- Magazines?
- Yeah, <i>Playboy, Perfect 10.</i>

11:02.286 --> 11:03.746
- Everything.
- This is bullshit.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.790
That's what the department's come to, Tom.

11:05.790 --> 11:10.211
Bunch of micromanaging bullshit
bean counters showing up out of the blue.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.420
- Yeah.
- Pricks.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.923
- Call me when the meal's on.
- All right, chief.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.049
Unbelievable.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.926
This is what they're gonna waste time on.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.010
Come and, you know--

11:25.267 --> 11:28.145
That's my spot! Give me that copy.
That's my spot!

11:28.145 --> 11:31.273
You know what? This is so sad, really sad.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.443
You're right. It's sad.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.655
We've reduced ourselves to animals.
That's what we are.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.909
A bunch of dumbass,
animal house frat boys.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.120
- Morons.
- Morons might be a bit harsh, Lou.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.038
No, morons is right, because...

11:46.872 --> 11:52.002
all of the porno tapes and DVDs...

11:52.253 --> 11:53.462
are up in the bunk room.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.547
Whoa!

11:55.172 --> 11:56.173
Son of a bitch.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.769
Shit.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.354
What in the hell happened to him?

12:10.479 --> 12:13.023
He must've taken the white pills.
Sleeping pills.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.817
He's totally dead to the world.

12:14.942 --> 12:15.943
Hey, what kind were they?

12:16.777 --> 12:18.112
- Somunall.
- Somunall?

12:18.112 --> 12:20.030
Damn, those are the pills in the news--

12:20.030 --> 12:21.949
- I know, I know.
- What are you talking about?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.409
People sleepwalk on those.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.661
Sleepwalk, they sleep-drive,
they sleep-eat.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.497
A woman gained a 100 pounds
while on Weight Watchers.

12:28.622 --> 12:31.083
Every night, unbeknownst to her,
she'd sleepwalk to the kitchen

12:31.083 --> 12:32.835
and sleep-eat away Oreos,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.670
four pints of Haägen-Dazs,
and a dozen donuts.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.923
What about sleep-food-shopping?
Talk about pointing the wrong finger.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.259
Why do you have the pills
if you don't take them?

12:40.509 --> 12:43.471
- Duh, I'm a junkie, okay?
- But you quit now, right?

12:43.721 --> 12:47.266
Yeah, but I was-- in case I had a relapse,
I didn't wanna have to go...

12:47.933 --> 12:50.644
searching for the pills,
I was planning ahead.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.855
For the bender that
AA's to stop you from having.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.565
Nice cult you joined, by the way.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.817
Sleepwalking is the least of problems.
He took four.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.319
He's gonna be sleeping until--

12:58.319 --> 13:01.030
- Get him out before the chief sees him.
- Three days--

13:01.238 --> 13:03.282
Make sure he hasn't drowned in my dip.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.408
- Wanna know something?
- What?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.619
You're kidding, right? Come on.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.579
I make a good goddamn spinach dip.

13:08.746 --> 13:09.872
Sorry.
Ridiculous.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.791
You got pills, I got dip.
Let's get him up.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.125
Probie, legs.
Got it.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.127
Jesus Christ.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.588
Get him, get him, get him, get him.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.882
Oh.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.428
Come on, watch his head.
Watch his head.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.266
Watch his head and hands.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.851
Jesus, Garrity.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.188
You know, probie,
why don't you tie your shoes, you know?

13:35.272 --> 13:36.565
Here we go.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.192
Watch it.
He's out.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.110
Mikey, go get something
to clean up his puss.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.696
- All right.
- Get paper towels or something wet.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.657
Actually, get a rag and wet it down, okay?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.367
This is what you're planning ahead for?

13:46.617 --> 13:48.577
Franco, you got a rag over there
or something--

13:48.577 --> 13:50.704
- Franco, get away from that porno.
- I'm just--

13:50.871 --> 13:52.832
- I'm taking what's mine.
- Oh, yeah? Let me see.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.459
Let me see, yeah. <i>Forrest Hump,</i> mine.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.878
<i>- King Schlong,</i> mine.
<i>- King Schlong's</i> mine--

13:58.003 --> 13:59.839
- No, you brought <i>King Dong.</i>
- Right.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.424
Which sucked.
Girls had mosquito bites for tits.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.509
Because they're real tits.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.178
That's what tits look like,
Johnny Giant Fake Boob.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.931
Excuse me for being American.
I like to suck on big tits.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.725
It's political issue?
I'm a terrorist because I like real tits?

14:11.725 --> 14:13.602
Political? What? What about the sag fags?

14:13.602 --> 14:15.896
- What sag fags?
- Guys, guys, guys.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.773
Guys, are we actually arguing about tits?

14:17.773 --> 14:19.400
Come on.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.736
(OVER P.A.) <i>Engine.</i>
Forget it. Here we go.

14:22.736 --> 14:23.821
<i>Ladder.</i>

14:25.155 --> 14:26.156
<i>Battalion.</i>

14:26.156 --> 14:27.366
- Franco.
- Yeah.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.255
You know what, guys? I know this address.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.924
My cousin's a sculptor,
used to have a studio in this place.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.136
It's like an old warehouse
divided up into a million tiny rooms.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.721
Keep your head straight, 'cause...

14:48.846 --> 14:51.390
you get lost there,
it can get real confusing fast.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.568
- You got a cousin sculptor?
- Every family's got a black sheep.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.946
Most families get, like, a retard
or a guy who likes to wear dresses.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.406
We got a sculptor.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.033
Retard, sculptor, same thing.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.952
There was a retard sculptor,
<i>60 Minutes</i> did a piece on him.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.537
Yeah?
Brilliant work.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.248
He was real quick too.
He'd make one or two statues a day.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.042
One problem.
What was that?

15:18.042 --> 15:19.543
He liked the taste of clay.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.545
You're saying?
He'd eat his work.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.213
What a waste.
Not really.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.716
You know,
every time he took a shit, genius.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.599
Hey, T.
Yeah?

15:33.599 --> 15:36.477
You and probie go that way.
Franco and I, this way.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.521
- Five on this floor?
- They said five. Five.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.273
Come on, probie. Yep.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.116
Got it, Franco?
Yeah.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.160
Anybody in here? Anybody hear me?

15:53.160 --> 15:54.244
Anybody in here?

16:02.378 --> 16:04.046
The shit's here.
All right.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.307
You all right?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.768
You okay?
Yeah, I lost my hook.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.779
You good?
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.284
Oh!

16:36.453 --> 16:38.539
You all right, brother?
Yeah.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.290
Yeah, I'm okay.
Yeah?

16:41.041 --> 16:42.376
What do we do now?

16:45.254 --> 16:48.090
This has gotta be north.
Window's on the north side.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.263
Yo, come here.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.057
I can't see shit.
Me neither.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.892
Grab a wall.
All right.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.190
No windows, no good.
What you got up in there, Lou?

17:05.399 --> 17:07.401
I got nothing. Shit. Shit.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.610
Shit.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.282
Lou!

17:13.741 --> 17:15.576
I'm thinking! Shit!

17:19.830 --> 17:21.165
I think she's okay.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.001
Grab her.
All right.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.092
Hey, nice going.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.137
- The kid. The kid's still got a chance.
- Okay.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.189
<i>- Hey, Tommy.</i>
- Yeah?

17:45.689 --> 17:47.149
<i>- We're stuck.</i>
- Where?

17:47.483 --> 17:49.485
<i>We're in a room off the hallway
we went down.</i>

17:49.735 --> 17:51.153
<i>We're losing air, you gotta hurry.</i>

17:51.153 --> 17:52.404
I'm on my way, I'm on my way.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.114
No.
Grab him.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.369
Lou, where are you guys?

17:59.369 --> 18:02.289
We're in a room, off the hallway, T.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.459
It should be facing north.
The windows face north.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.336
Turn on your pass alarm.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.009
All right, I got you.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.511
T, hurry!

18:16.136 --> 18:17.679
We're almost out of air!

18:19.640 --> 18:21.642
Lou!

18:30.317 --> 18:31.318
This way, guys.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.828
You can take my spot.
Go ahead, Lou.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.457
You all right?

18:48.877 --> 18:50.879
I can't find my hat. I got it.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.842
That's-- that's the problem.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.803
What happened?
I tried getting through on the radio.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.763
Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.

18:59.763 --> 19:03.225
Where the hell is Garrity?
He never left. Long story.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.810
- Tom?
- It's a mess.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.062
Goddamn mess. Goddamn doors everywhere.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.731
- Everybody get out?
- Yeah, two dead.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.650
Right. Any kids?

19:11.900 --> 19:14.278
- No, why?
- Just checking.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.743
- You all right?
- Yeah, that was fun, huh?

19:22.286 --> 19:24.830
Oh, yeah,
next best thing to having sex, right?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.624
Yeah. Smoke was killing me, man.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.795
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you.
How's things going with Keela?

19:31.920 --> 19:35.340
They're in Disneyland for 10 days.
I'm gonna see her when she gets back.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.550
Right, right.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.178
Guess that's better than nothing, right?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.430
Do me a favor?
Will you double check on Lou?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.056
- I'm worried about him.
- Yeah.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.184
- I'll take care of this shit.
- All right.

20:14.671 --> 20:15.672
Hey, man.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.883
Wanna grab a beer after work?

20:18.383 --> 20:19.801
I gotta go see my Uncle Red.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.970
Oh, yeah? How's he doing?

20:22.512 --> 20:24.139
Face cancer spread to his balls.

20:26.892 --> 20:27.935
How did that happen?

20:28.977 --> 20:30.896
Sucking his own cock again.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.731
Too much.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.611
Sorry about tonight, Frankie.

20:37.611 --> 20:41.281
Oh, hey, man, don't even sweat it.
I mean, at least you had an idea.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.784
- I didn't know which damn way to go.
- Yeah.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.332
You know, Lou,

20:51.083 --> 20:52.125
when I get stuck like that,

20:52.125 --> 20:54.419
there's only two people
I'd follow in a heartbeat,

20:54.670 --> 20:56.046
that's you and Tommy.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.674
You've saved my ass,

20:58.674 --> 21:00.884
goddamn, I don't even know how many times.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.803
So tonight, you didn't.

21:03.845 --> 21:04.846
Yeah.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.725
That's all you gotta say is "yeah"?

21:09.476 --> 21:10.477
Uh-huh.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.149
No sweat, man.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.279
Hey, buddy.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.490
Where's the mustard?

22:48.784 --> 22:49.785
Thanks very much.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.039
You know something, pal?

22:54.414 --> 22:56.041
You gotta lose, like, 75 pounds.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.417
Seriously, bro.

22:57.542 --> 23:01.088
If I gotta pull you out of a fire,
that's gonna be awful slow going.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.807
Juice.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.356
Hey, lady.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.400
Wow, that's a really ugly baby.

23:21.775 --> 23:25.237
I mean, I'm sure she's gonna grow up
to be a very gorgeous person one day,

23:25.404 --> 23:28.532
but there's no reason you should be
showing her in public anytime soon.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.866
Okay, bye-bye.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.634
Sir? Sir?
Yes. Yes?

23:47.634 --> 23:49.261
- You have to pay.
- No, it's okay.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.054
I'm a fireman with 62 truck.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.223
We don't get paid enough as it is

23:53.223 --> 23:56.935
and God forbid this store catch fire,
I would be the one to save you.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.896
So I think the least that you can do
if offer me some...

24:00.355 --> 24:02.774
free food, you know, as reward, okay?

24:02.941 --> 24:05.527
And, buddy, that comb over,
it's not fooling anyone.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.697
Good luck, God bless,
good night, New York.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.745
Hey, what's up, man?

24:16.037 --> 24:18.457
This your car?
Yeah, it's cool, right?

24:18.832 --> 24:20.876
- Sorry?
- The car, it's cool, right?

24:21.042 --> 24:22.919
You know what color that is? Copper.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.838
- Hey, what you writing there?
- A ticket.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.798
Woah. You can write those?

24:27.591 --> 24:28.592
Yeah.

24:28.925 --> 24:32.053
Do me a favor, write me two tickets
to the U2 concert at the Garden?

24:32.053 --> 24:34.556
I love U2 too. My mom and my sister.

24:34.806 --> 24:37.392
My mom loves Bono
because of the whole world hunger thing.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.935
Actually, uh, my mom's...

24:39.311 --> 24:41.855
Will you write us 12, 12 tickets?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.148
What?

24:43.315 --> 24:44.983
Whoa, hey. Cool gun.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.359
Put your hands behind your head.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.195
Oh, my God.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.241
Uh, I got a, uh...

24:53.783 --> 24:55.535
Uh, Jesus,
I don't know what else to call it.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.330
- A zombie over here.
- Hey, I'll call you tomorrow, bro.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.499
Take some candy, they're giving it away.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.679
I've never heard you guys so quiet.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.765
What the hell happened in there?

25:29.277 --> 25:30.278
Nothing.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.031
Just a little messy, that's all.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.163
What the hell?

25:41.039 --> 25:42.374
- Who are you?
- You Bill?

25:42.707 --> 25:44.960
- No, I'm not Bill.
- Oh, you must be Otis.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.212
Otis? Who the hell is Otis?

25:47.212 --> 25:49.005
- Goddamn it, Sean.
- You're Nacho.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.549
That's right, asshole.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.262
Who the hell was that?

25:55.971 --> 25:57.681
I think that was my new boyfriend.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.528
What's going on, officer?

26:11.528 --> 26:16.157
A man wearing a T-shirt
that had a Ladder 62 FDNY logo on it,

26:16.533 --> 26:19.369
double parked over at the supermarket,
and he, uh...

26:20.203 --> 26:22.872
I don't know how else to say this,
he looked like a...

26:22.872 --> 26:24.249
like a zombie.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.167
A zombie?

26:26.167 --> 26:28.003
He stole food and candy and--

26:28.003 --> 26:30.422
He was really scary
and he told me...

26:30.797 --> 26:32.424
He told me I should lose weight.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.925
He called my baby ugly.

26:39.139 --> 26:42.100
- And what'd he say to you?
- He made fun of my hair.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.145
We're all pretty much accounted for here,

26:45.312 --> 26:47.647
except for Garrity, who's sleeping
in the bunk room.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.357
Sure?
He took sleeping pills.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.861
Accidentally, and he's gonna be sleeping
until the middle of next week.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.614
And he's been accused of a lot of things
in his life

26:55.780 --> 26:58.033
but being a brutally honest,
scary-looking,

26:58.033 --> 26:59.701
walk-the-earth type of zombie?

27:00.243 --> 27:02.120
- That's above his-- No offence.
- No chance.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.204
You know?

27:04.289 --> 27:06.416
Hey, guys, look what I got.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.835
A bunny.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.338
It's cool, right. I always wanted a bunny.

27:11.838 --> 27:12.881
Hey, bro.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.425
You know, I need two more tickets
to that U2 concert.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.761
Turns out my dad and my stepmom
are huge fans.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.304
Well, mostly my stepmom.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.097
She's my age, my dad's, like, 60.

27:21.348 --> 27:24.184
So it's kind of creepy actually,
when you think about it.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.144
I'm gonna go find this guy some carrots.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.442
Hey.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.943
some fireman from this house took my--

27:34.110 --> 27:36.279
Yeah, let me guess,
he stole a bunny rabbit, right?

27:36.279 --> 27:37.364
It's here.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.449
- Yeah?
<i>- You're gonna love this.</i>

27:39.449 --> 27:40.742
You remember Sheila Capacona?

27:40.742 --> 27:43.703
The blond with the tits,
used to hang with Janet and Sheila,

27:43.703 --> 27:47.165
and they used to make fun of me
and those girls and they all hated me?

27:47.332 --> 27:48.333
Yeah?

27:48.333 --> 27:50.877
She's a hostess
at a shitty, little Italian place.

27:50.877 --> 27:54.547
She's working tonight.
She knows about you, Janet, Johnny and me.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.800
- And?
- So we show up there.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.760
We totally act like we're together.

27:58.885 --> 28:01.096
By 11 o' clock,
she can't keep her hands off the phone.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.223
Johnny and Janet are cursing
our souls to hell.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.809
I--
Let me think about it. Sounds like it--

28:05.809 --> 28:07.519
Hey, I made a 10 o'clock reservation.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.105
- Get your skinny ass here, pronto.
- Okay.

28:19.781 --> 28:20.907
Sean of the Dead.

28:24.619 --> 28:26.121
Goddamn, that's good dip.

28:31.501 --> 28:34.045
- Yeah?
- Hey, are you on your way home?

28:34.421 --> 28:35.797
What do you mean? For what?

28:36.131 --> 28:38.758
Well, your dad's drunk again
and he's asleep.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.218
But, uh...

28:40.844 --> 28:42.887
I was thinking since you're off tonight
that, um...

28:43.096 --> 28:45.348
maybe we might talk.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.058
- For what?
<i>- I don't know, whatever.</i>

28:47.225 --> 28:49.394
You, us.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.105
Your crying jags.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.024
- Jag. Jag, okay? It was one time.
- Uh-huh.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.234
Jags.

28:56.609 --> 28:59.279
Listen, Tommy.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.031
I went through this.

29:03.074 --> 29:05.326
Okay? It comes in waves.

29:05.618 --> 29:08.580
I used to fall apart in the cereal aisle
in a grocery store

29:08.705 --> 29:12.584
for two years after 9/11,
or in the car out of the blue, or...

29:13.418 --> 29:14.627
in the shower.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.589
But I used to talk to people about it. I--

29:17.714 --> 29:21.676
I talked to my therapist
and to my psychic--

29:21.843 --> 29:23.011
Yeah, right, the lesbo.

29:23.386 --> 29:26.723
Look, you gotta talk about this
or it ain't gonna go away.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.559
I-- I'm running late here,
I gotta get going, all right?

29:31.060 --> 29:33.521
I think you have a date
and don't wanna tell me about it.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.565
- What?
- And let me tell you something.

29:35.690 --> 29:39.152
I could give less of a shit. I got stuff
in that department, dates of my own.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.737
Oh, is that so? Like what?

29:40.737 --> 29:43.031
Like, uh, oh, Tony Scaluso.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.033
- What, the weightlifter steroid guy?
- Mmm-hmm.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.868
I went out with him last night.
We had dinner.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.078
And he is a total asshole.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.997
- But the body on him.
- So, what--

29:50.997 --> 29:53.041
you slept with him?

29:53.249 --> 29:55.585
Oh! That's none of your business.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.881
- Who else?
- You really wanna get into this?

30:02.175 --> 30:03.510
All right, I-- I gotta go.

30:03.968 --> 30:06.304
You're-- you're what?
You're sleeping around now?

30:06.429 --> 30:09.140
Sampling. I'm sampling.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.686
- You?
- Gotta go.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.653
Hey.
Hey, come in.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.863
- I think we better rehearse.
- Uh, rehearse?

30:24.405 --> 30:26.366
What we're gonna do, okay? Sit down.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.826
All right.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.829
- So we're gonna start like this, right?
- Okay.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.414
We order our appetizers and wine.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.375
- In your case, water, okay?
- Right.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.627
Wine comes, we sip, we talk, we laugh.

30:37.877 --> 30:39.337
And then you take this hand.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.632
- And then you put it here.
- Oh, okay.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.218
And then I lean in and I laugh,

30:45.385 --> 30:47.053
and I put this hand here.

30:48.012 --> 30:52.767
Then you lean in and you whisper something
that I find very sexy.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.520
- Mmm, okay.
- Okay, and then you kiss me.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.564
Okay.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.524
Okay, go ahead.

31:00.066 --> 31:02.819
- Uh, go ahead?
- Go ahead, kiss me.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.320
Oh, okay, um...

31:05.697 --> 31:06.698
Uh...

31:08.491 --> 31:09.868
Uh.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.620
Hey, what kind of pussy kiss was that?

31:12.620 --> 31:15.540
You-- you have to kiss me
like you mean it, you have to...

31:15.707 --> 31:17.292
- You know what, linger a little.
- Okay.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.585
Okay. Linger.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.045
- We wanna make it look real, right?
- Yes, yes.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.130
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.591
All right, so here I-- here I go.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.850
Oh, you're good at this, okay.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.060
That's good. Um...

31:36.436 --> 31:38.563
Yes, the third time that you kiss me.

31:38.897 --> 31:39.981
Oh, there's three?

31:40.607 --> 31:43.151
There's four... there's five, actually,

31:43.151 --> 31:44.777
if you count the deep tongue kiss,

31:44.777 --> 31:47.655
with the mutual groping
and the tit rub after we leave.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.741
But the third time that you kiss me,

31:50.617 --> 31:51.826
grab my ass a little.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.828
Okay, d-- define "a little."

31:54.120 --> 31:55.663
Okay, so you kiss me again.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.707
All right, this is the third kiss?

31:57.957 --> 31:58.958
- Yeah. Kiss,
- Okay.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.961
linger, hand behind the head, ass grab.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.047
Okay. Got it. All right.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.306
Oh, oh.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.516
Oh, you are good at this.

32:15.516 --> 32:17.060
- This is gonna be fun.
- Yes, yeah.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.062
- Okay.
- Uh...

32:19.187 --> 32:22.982
Do you-- do you wanna try the, um,
sidewalk tit rub thing?

32:23.232 --> 32:25.485
What-- it's--
No, I'll explain it to you in the car.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.195
- Let's go, let's go.
- Okay, okay.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.119
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.496
Hey, you're on your way?

32:36.746 --> 32:41.167
Uh, well, we had a situation here
and, uh, Garrity's kind of messed up.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.462
- And chief asked me to cover for him so--
- Goddamn it.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.714
- I gotta work.
- Mike, I was making us linguine.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.383
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

32:48.549 --> 32:52.679
So they, uh,
couldn't get someone else to cover?

32:52.929 --> 32:53.972
They all got seniority.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.599
Mike, you gotta get out of that house.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.184
I know. Christ.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.478
So when will you be home?

33:00.645 --> 33:02.814
Uh, pretty late, like, after midnight.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.273
- Okay.
- Pissed?

33:04.649 --> 33:05.650
No, no.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.902
- I'll see you then, pal.
- Okay.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.200
We just caught a break, big boy.

33:28.715 --> 33:29.757
So the cancer...

33:30.049 --> 33:32.719
My face, my balls, that's it.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.888
- Face and balls, that's pretty serious.
- Hey.

33:36.431 --> 33:39.642
My age, face and balls
is the least important part of my life.

33:40.476 --> 33:44.355
Mouth, ass, legs, hands.
In that order, my friend.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.276
I gotta eat, I gotta shit,
I gotta walk, I gotta pick stuff up.

33:48.484 --> 33:51.320
Otherwise, the rest of me
is pretty much cancer-friendly.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.742
- No vodka, Red?
- Vodka's for fags and women.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.620
Real Irishmen drink whisky.
Get that in you.

33:59.871 --> 34:03.249
- Beer chaser?
- It's dark out, for Christ's sake.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.419
So, what's eating you?

34:07.420 --> 34:08.671
I screwed up tonight.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.424
I lost my bearings.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.052
I almost took me and Franco out.

34:15.845 --> 34:17.930
Tommy had to-- had to save our asses.

34:18.765 --> 34:21.142
- That's why we have Tommys.
- No, it's me.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.269
I've been drinking too much.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.315
Thinking about this broad
who screwed me over.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.567
I miss my ex-wife.

34:30.526 --> 34:34.322
Who seems all too happy, by the way.

34:35.615 --> 34:36.657
I don't know.

34:45.625 --> 34:46.709
Drink your drink.

34:47.919 --> 34:48.920
We're going out.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.882
- Going out where?
- You'll see.

34:54.383 --> 34:55.593
Listen to me, kid.

34:56.594 --> 35:00.556
I was a fireman for 50 goddamn years,
a real fireman.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.392
Before Scott packs and oxygen masks,

35:03.392 --> 35:06.354
and all this other goddamn pussy
breathing apparatus bullshit.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.857
We went into a fire with a cigarette
in one hand, a Halligan in the other.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.485
And I know a sorry-for-yourself story
when I hear one.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.362
I'm taking you downtown.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.072
Refill my glass.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.999
You look great, Shirl.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.084
So do you.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.253
- And you too, Tommy.
- Oh, thanks.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.261
I can't believe you guys
just happened to stop in here.

35:38.427 --> 35:41.097
Oh, you know, well,
we were just in the neighborhood,

35:41.097 --> 35:43.099
and, uh, we were thinking Italian.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.269
- How's Tony?
- Oh, he's great.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.021
Our 25-year anniversary
is coming up next month.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.648
- Wow.
- Well, that's great.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.358
I know, I know.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.070
So try the spaghetti bolognaise,
it's heaven.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.531
- Thanks, Shirl.
- Thank you, Shirl.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.286
Okay, it's really busy in here.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.079
We might have to go
right into ass-grab mode.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.831
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, look around.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.125
The place is jammed,
phone's ringing off the hook.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.710
- Kiss me.
- Now?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.879
- Yeah, kiss, linger, ass grab, now.
- Okay.

36:18.217 --> 36:19.218
Perfect.

36:20.052 --> 36:21.762
- Really?
- Did you see her face?

36:22.555 --> 36:24.682
No, I was a little busy.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.185
Holy shit, she's going for the phone.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.145
- Okay?
- Okay, rub my left thigh.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.565
- It could be just a reserva--
- I don't think so. Rub my left thigh.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.691
Okay.

36:33.941 --> 36:35.776
- Sexier, more subtle.
- Oh, okay.

36:38.821 --> 36:41.449
Oh, shit, she hung up.
It must've been a work call.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.575
Goddamn it.

36:42.575 --> 36:45.077
- All right, I guess we better order.
- Okay.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.497
Just for our discriminating
customers, I'm gonna seat you guys in VIP.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.502
Bring us a couple of big whiskies,
Georgie, and a cheeseburger.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.088
- Lou?
- I'm good with the whisky, thanks.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.216
- Thanks, Georgie.
- No problem, Red.

36:58.424 --> 37:00.134
Hey, you look great, as always.

37:00.676 --> 37:01.677
You too, kid.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.808
No matter what you think...

37:09.310 --> 37:10.311
and believe me,

37:10.478 --> 37:13.814
every fireman at some point in his career,
gets the jangle.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.360
That little bit of nervous wreck
that hits you right in the ball sack.

37:17.526 --> 37:18.527
It's normal.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.697
If you don't feel it,
that's when you should worry.

37:21.864 --> 37:24.784
But you are making a difference
every goddamn day.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.537
- Not today I didn't.
- Okay, not every day, but most days.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.957
Pull on those boots, that gear,
jump on the rig tomorrow,

37:31.249 --> 37:32.416
maybe that's the day.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.378
- Thanks, Georgie.
- It's my treat.

37:35.878 --> 37:36.879
Bullshit.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.631
When have you paid in this joint?

37:38.839 --> 37:40.383
Shut up and drink, old man.

37:42.301 --> 37:43.970
All right, so let's cut to the chase.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.056
You remember when you were a teenager,

37:47.306 --> 37:50.768
I used to tell you about that kid
got trapped in a fire in the Bronx?

37:51.227 --> 37:53.354
Burned all over his legs? Out cold?

37:53.646 --> 37:54.647
I pulled him out,

37:54.814 --> 37:57.191
only reason I found him
was I took a wrong turn?

37:57.191 --> 37:59.485
I smelled flesh burning
coming from under the bed?

37:59.819 --> 38:02.405
He was in a coma for a month,
I visited him in the hospital.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.615
Yeah, it was a big fire,
was in the papers, pictures.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.451
- My mother had it up on the mantle.
- Right, that kid?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.288
That was Georgie.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.543
I don't take a wrong turn that day...

38:16.085 --> 38:18.462
Georgie ain't cooking me
this cheeseburger tonight.

38:18.754 --> 38:21.632
- Somebody else might've saved him.
- Might've, would've, could've.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.260
We can't rewrite history, my friend.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.595
I make a wrong turn that day,

38:27.096 --> 38:29.015
Georgie cooks the cheeseburger tonight.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.643
That's it, it's that simple. No bullshit.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.770
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

38:36.939 --> 38:38.733
Where's my burger, asshole?

38:39.108 --> 38:41.902
What am I, David Copperfield over here?
Hang on.

38:45.448 --> 38:48.743
- This sucks.
- Really? 'Cause my linguine's pretty good.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.910
No, no, she's so busy,

38:49.910 --> 38:51.912
- she's not even looking over here.
- Oh.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.790
- Oh, no.
- What?

38:55.041 --> 38:56.876
My ex. He's outside.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.544
This guy won't let it go.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.964
- How did he know we were here?
- I told you, he follows me.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.884
All right, I'm gonna put an end
to this right now.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.762
No, Tommy, I'm telling you,
Sebastian's crazy.

39:08.721 --> 39:11.223
- His name is Sebastian?
- Yeah.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.142
I think I can handle it.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.022
Hey, asshole.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.274
Hey, I know who you are.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.359
Yeah?

39:21.901 --> 39:23.444
She's mine. She loves me.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.529
I got news for you. She hates your guts.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.115
Next time I see you here,
I'm not calling the cops,

39:28.115 --> 39:30.951
I'm gonna kick your midget ass
myself, okay, Sebastian?

39:31.118 --> 39:32.119
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.622
That'd be the next time
you have the balls to take her out.

39:34.789 --> 39:35.790
- You got that?
- Really?

39:35.790 --> 39:37.333
- Yeah.
- You got that? Yeah, hey.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.211
- He's leaving?
- Yeah.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.463
This guy's tiny.
I've taken bigger shits than this.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.091
- I'm telling you, Tommy--
- Yeah, he knows kung fu.

39:45.257 --> 39:46.258
Oh, I'm scared.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.431
- She's watching us right now.
- Oh, really?

39:52.431 --> 39:53.516
- Uh-huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.644
- She's got the phone in her hands.
- Yeah?

39:56.977 --> 39:57.978
- So kiss.
- Yep.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.271
- Linger,
- Mmm-hmm.

39:59.271 --> 40:00.356
- grope,
- Mmm-hmm.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.149
- ass grab, tit rub.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.610
Okay, wait, wait, I forgot, I forgot.
Uh, grope...

40:04.610 --> 40:06.445
- Ass grab, tit rub.
- Right.

40:11.283 --> 40:14.703
Oh, she's still on the phone,
it's working like a goddamn charm.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.248
- Second tit rub, go.
- Okay.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.878
Okay, she hung up. All right, let's go.

40:23.045 --> 40:26.340
- Oh, what about the bill?
- No, no, I paid. It's okay, come on.

40:27.174 --> 40:30.177
- You are a great kisser. Oh, my God.
- I know.

40:30.386 --> 40:31.595
You too.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.721
Oh, hang on a sec.

40:35.933 --> 40:36.934
It's Janet.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.227
- Answer it.
- Right, right, right.

40:39.645 --> 40:40.729
Yeah?

40:41.647 --> 40:42.982
Uh-- uh...

40:43.816 --> 40:47.069
Well, actually, Lou's, uh,
Lou's sleeping at Uncle Red's tonight,

40:47.236 --> 40:49.947
and, you know, Dad's,
you know, probably asleep.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.867
He's asleep by 9:30
with his five glasses of wine in him.

40:53.325 --> 40:54.368
What's up?

40:55.286 --> 40:56.579
Uh, how's half an hour?

40:57.746 --> 40:59.373
All right, I'll see you then.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.251
- What, what, what?
- She wants to talk, it sounds urgent.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.419
Oh, my God.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.796
- This is unbelievable.
- Awesome.

41:05.796 --> 41:08.424
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God, goddamn bitch.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.885
He's gonna shit bricks
when he finds out, the scumbag.

41:11.135 --> 41:14.305
- Come on, come on. Let's get me home.
- Right, right, right.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.682
Hey.
Hey.

41:17.057 --> 41:18.517
How you doing?

41:18.851 --> 41:19.852
So we alone?

41:21.145 --> 41:24.732
Yeah. I mean, Dad's here
but he's dreaming of dead Nazis.

41:26.066 --> 41:27.443
- How you doing?
- Good.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.153
You're not gonna kiss me hello?

41:29.403 --> 41:30.738
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.826
So how you been?

41:37.077 --> 41:38.454
What? You...

41:39.288 --> 41:42.416
- You-- you pissed about something?
- Yeah, a little.

41:42.708 --> 41:43.709
Well...

41:44.835 --> 41:46.253
- What?
- The kiss.

41:47.046 --> 41:48.714
- Huh?
- Was that all you got?

41:49.340 --> 41:50.341
What do you mean?

41:55.638 --> 41:56.639
Holy shit.

41:58.307 --> 41:59.308
Jesus, Janet.

41:59.934 --> 42:00.935
Wow.

42:06.273 --> 42:08.359
All right. Oh, my God.

42:08.567 --> 42:09.568
Okay.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.279
Oh, my God. Oh, baby.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.491
Oh!

42:18.869 --> 42:19.870
Yeah, baby.

42:50.859 --> 42:51.860
Shit.

42:53.153 --> 42:54.154
Wow.

42:55.823 --> 42:58.450
- You look great.
- Yeah, I know.

43:03.622 --> 43:06.208
Uh, so listen, uh...

43:06.834 --> 43:09.587
Colleen's been in some trouble
at school.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.463
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

43:11.463 --> 43:14.341
Called her teacher a bitch,
slapped one of her classmates.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.385
So they want her to see a counsellor.

43:16.969 --> 43:19.263
- I think it has to do with Connor.
- Mmm.

43:19.847 --> 43:21.724
And you not being around anymore.

43:22.725 --> 43:25.853
Right, it has nothing to do
with the fact that you're...

43:26.186 --> 43:30.065
sleeping with and living with her uncle?

43:31.275 --> 43:34.486
I would really appreciate it
if you went with her to the first session.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.071
I think Johnny should go.

43:36.071 --> 43:39.116
He could make good use
out of some time with a shrink.

43:39.283 --> 43:40.909
Okay, Tommy, it is not a shrink.

43:41.493 --> 43:43.746
They help kids.
They talk them through things.

43:44.872 --> 43:47.374
Like last year,
when Colleen's classmate got killed

43:47.374 --> 43:48.792
in that airplane crash.

43:49.209 --> 43:51.420
The counsellor helped them
talk through their grief.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.382
But you know what? Just forget it.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.760
No, no, no, you know what? I'll do it.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.595
I should be spending more time with her.

44:00.054 --> 44:02.389
- That would be nice.
- I'll do it.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.641
Thanks.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.977
For the Colleen thing or the...

44:07.311 --> 44:08.312
Both.

44:09.355 --> 44:12.191
- Payback's a bitch, huh?
- Yeah.

44:22.242 --> 44:23.827
Hey.

44:24.244 --> 44:25.245
Can you talk?

44:25.245 --> 44:27.831
There's no way Shirley got ahold of her.

44:28.082 --> 44:30.376
- You sure?
- I'm pretty goddamn sure.

44:30.376 --> 44:31.669
She was talking to somebody.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.171
I could tell by the way
she was hawk-eyeing us.

44:34.296 --> 44:37.633
Yeah, well, it wasn't Janet.
I don't know who else it could've been.

44:37.925 --> 44:39.426
Well, who else would give a shit?

44:39.760 --> 44:42.429
No, no, no!

44:46.892 --> 44:51.230
No! I'll kill you!

44:52.564 --> 44:54.983
You bastard! Bitch!
