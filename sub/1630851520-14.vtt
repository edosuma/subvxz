Al, can I have
some privacy?

00:04.786 --> 00:06.049
Why?

00:06.092 --> 00:07.658
Holly's gonna FaceTime
from Hawaii.

00:07.703 --> 00:08.704
So?

00:08.746 --> 00:10.445
So, I would like some alone time

00:10.487 --> 00:12.099
to talk to her.Why?

00:12.141 --> 00:13.317
Get out of here!

00:13.361 --> 00:15.057
Wow.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.016
Take some deep breaths
before you talk to her.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.975
This is not attractive.

00:20.932 --> 00:22.631
[ringing]

00:22.673 --> 00:24.067
Aloha.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.721
Oh, hey there, sailor.

00:25.763 --> 00:26.896
You miss me yet?

00:26.939 --> 00:30.117
Nah, it's only been 157 hours.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.900
How's the Reserves?

00:31.943 --> 00:33.162
Eh, same thing every year.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.817
We're running around a ship,

00:34.859 --> 00:36.079
fighting fake fires,

00:36.122 --> 00:37.646
shooting pistols into the ocean.

00:37.689 --> 00:40.344
Ah, man. That sounds awesome.

00:40.387 --> 00:42.390
Well, it hasn't all been fun.

00:42.432 --> 00:45.131
At night, we have to go out
drinking in Waikiki.

00:45.174 --> 00:46.915
Aw, poor you.

00:46.959 --> 00:47.917
[chuckles]

00:47.960 --> 00:49.222
What have you been up to?

00:49.265 --> 00:51.268
Oh, where do I start?

00:51.311 --> 00:54.531
It was leg day,
but I did some arms, too.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.098
Good for you.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.231
Hey, we'll be underway
at zero-four tomorrow,

00:58.274 --> 00:59.667
so my phone's gonna be off

00:59.710 --> 01:00.929
until we pull back into port
next week.

01:00.972 --> 01:02.323
Okay, well, if I need you,

01:02.365 --> 01:04.412
I'll just tie a message
to a dolphin.

01:04.454 --> 01:06.805
SAILOR:
Yo, Holly, we got to go.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.850
Oh, sorry, I got to run.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.983
The guys are taking the duty van
down to the beach.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.420
A little search
and destroy mission.

01:13.463 --> 01:15.771
Search for a bar
and destroy your liver?

01:15.813 --> 01:17.902
You are welcome for my service.

want me to hear?

You're not?

No. I'm going to pottery
class with Lizzie.

Lizzie my daughter?

02:10.129 --> 02:11.217
Why didn't I know about this?

02:11.260 --> 02:13.480
I told you yesterday.You did?

02:13.524 --> 02:15.177
Yeah, we were watching
the basketball game.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.658
Oh, well,
you can't tell me something

02:16.700 --> 02:18.354
during the basketball game.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.356
That's like telling me something
during a football game.

02:20.401 --> 02:23.012
We're going to pottery class
together.

have to be there?

I need your help in the,
in the kitchen real quick.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.807
Yeah. One sec.

Hey. Go easy when you're
talking about me with Lois.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.814
I don't know
what girls gab about.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.076
Just don't say anything
embarrassing.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.340
Like what?

02:46.383 --> 02:48.211
I'm not gonna give
you any ideas.

02:49.256 --> 02:52.127
I promise I will not tell her
that you iron your jeans

02:52.171 --> 02:53.563
and write Top Gunfan fiction.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.262
Keep it down.

You have nothing to worry about.

Hey, Dad,
can I have 20 bucks?

03:09.711 --> 03:11.060
What for?

03:11.103 --> 03:12.627
Don't know yet.
Could be something dumb.

03:12.669 --> 03:14.585
Could be something magical.
Just pocket money.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.283
We're not "pocket money" people.

03:17.326 --> 03:19.676
We're "tell me what you
need and I'll find a cheaper,

03:19.721 --> 03:21.896
worse version of it" people.

03:23.985 --> 03:25.856
Absolutely not.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.859
Please.AL: Hazel.

03:27.902 --> 03:29.905
If you want money,
get a job.

03:30.687 --> 03:32.254
You know,
when I was in high school,

03:32.299 --> 03:34.213
I made good money returning
empty beer bottles.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.780
Grampy drank that much beer?

03:35.824 --> 03:37.825
Yep. It was all Grampy.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.614
Here's an idea.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.094
You could sell boiled eggs
door-to-door.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.444
Boiled eggs? Who does that?

03:48.489 --> 03:49.663
I did, in Afghanistan.

03:49.706 --> 03:51.143
We play a game where two people

03:51.187 --> 03:53.145
try to crack each other's
boiled eggs.

03:53.188 --> 03:56.670
If you make that cool here,
you could sell a lot of eggs.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.978
What about a dog walker?

04:00.021 --> 04:02.110
What? Ugh. No.

04:02.153 --> 04:06.157
I love dogs, and I've been
walking since I could walk.

04:06.201 --> 04:09.292
Dogs are filthy and disgusting.
You don't want to do that.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.337
I'm gonna go make some signs.

04:12.903 --> 04:15.384
A boiled egg will never
eat your shoes!

04:20.521 --> 04:22.391
How'd you find
this place?

04:22.435 --> 04:25.134
My mom used to throw
my birthday parties here.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.310
Oh, God,
I would have loved that.

04:27.353 --> 04:29.834
I have boys, so birthdays
were always go-karts

04:29.877 --> 04:32.183
and batting cages
and trips to the ER.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.317
[laughs]
Yeah, tell me about it.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.665
When Riley was 12,

04:35.709 --> 04:37.668
he had a Fight Club
themed birthday.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.887
A lot of kids broke
the first rule of fight club,

04:39.930 --> 04:42.324
and a lot of parents got angry.[chuckles]

04:42.369 --> 04:43.718
[sighs]

04:43.761 --> 04:45.327
You think your dad'll like
this bowl?

04:45.372 --> 04:46.677
If you can put chili in it,
he will.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.591
He's not a complicated man.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.332
You know, life is funny.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.379
After my divorce, I wasn't even
looking for anything.

04:52.422 --> 04:55.425
Then this handsome man
just fell into my life.

04:56.382 --> 04:57.949
Aw. [chuckles]

04:57.992 --> 05:00.300
What about you?
Any handsome men in your life?

05:00.343 --> 05:02.432
Maybe. Why do you ask?

05:02.475 --> 05:04.216
Oh, I'm just curious.

05:04.259 --> 05:06.480
Raising boys,
there's never any gossip.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.524
Or toilet paper.[laughs]

05:08.569 --> 05:11.963
Well, I've been seeing
this guy, Brett.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.225
He's in a punk band.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.184
Ooh, he sounds dangerous.

05:15.226 --> 05:16.358
He is not.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.535
He's a psychology professor.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.362
His car is powered by corn oil,

05:20.406 --> 05:22.278
and he wears a helmet
when he drives.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.629
So, you like him?

05:26.935 --> 05:31.983
But the truth is,
we haven't kissed yet.

05:32.983 --> 05:36.466
Good God, have you been dating
for more than ten minutes?

05:36.509 --> 05:38.468
It's not like
I don't want to kiss him.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.776
You know, I learned something
when I turned 50.

05:42.819 --> 05:44.125
What's that?

05:44.168 --> 05:46.606
Nothing matters,
do whatever you want.

05:46.649 --> 05:49.348
You think you want to kiss him,
do it, right now.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.524
Now?Yes.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.569
Where is he?This time of day,

05:53.613 --> 05:55.180
probably teaching a class.

05:55.223 --> 05:57.399
Perfect.Perfect?

05:57.444 --> 05:59.923
He's at work and in front of
a bunch of students.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.795
Nothing matters.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.930
Short-term memories are turned
into long-term memories

06:06.975 --> 06:08.541
in the hippocampus.

06:08.584 --> 06:11.413
A fun way to remember that is,
you'd remember

06:11.458 --> 06:14.374
if you saw a hippo on campus.

06:15.983 --> 06:18.507
Come on, guys,
I am trying here.

06:19.726 --> 06:21.468
Oh, hey, hi.

06:28.082 --> 06:29.824
Okay, see ya.

06:35.002 --> 06:38.875
Uh, so, hippocampus, uh...

right now.

I'll see you and Roscoe
tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.889
Guess who has
her first client.

06:52.933 --> 06:54.064
You're not still thinking about

06:54.108 --> 06:55.632
this dog walking nonsense,
are you?

06:55.675 --> 06:57.154
Yeah.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.201
I figure I can handle five dogs
at a time.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.115
Maybe six, if I put a brick
in each pocket

07:01.158 --> 07:02.812
to weigh me down.

07:02.857 --> 07:05.468
I don't like anything
about this.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.990
Hey, can you get me
some plastic bags

07:07.035 --> 07:08.122
from the grocery store?Why?

07:08.165 --> 07:09.603
To pick up their poop.

07:10.646 --> 07:12.475
You're gonna pick up their poop?

07:13.475 --> 07:14.608
Yeah, what do you think
they're walking

07:14.651 --> 07:16.000
around the neighborhood for?

07:16.043 --> 07:17.872
I walk around the neighborhood.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.307
I don't stop and poop.

07:19.350 --> 07:21.483
[phone rings]

07:21.528 --> 07:23.268
Hello, Dugan residence.

07:24.355 --> 07:25.879
Oh, cool, you saw my sign.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.447
What kind of dog do you have?

07:28.403 --> 07:29.449
A mastiff?

07:30.536 --> 07:31.841
Absolutely, no problem.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.540
I'm gonna need some big bags.

07:38.413 --> 07:40.197
You're working out again?

07:40.242 --> 07:42.199
Not again, still.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.507
Got to look good
when Holly gets back.

07:44.550 --> 07:45.855
What are you talking about?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.031
You look fine.

07:47.074 --> 07:48.423
Fine's not gonna cut it.

with 200 guys right now.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.516
Well, you're not seriously
worried about that, are you?

07:56.475 --> 07:59.216
[coughing]

07:59.261 --> 08:00.523
I think you missed a step.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.697
Yeah, I'm cutting back
on liquids.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.701
Supposed to give you
better definition.

08:05.745 --> 08:08.531
Oh, yeah, man.
You really let yourself go.

08:08.574 --> 08:10.228
I'm serious.

08:10.271 --> 08:11.533
What if she meets
somebody else?

08:11.577 --> 08:12.535
Somebody better?

08:12.579 --> 08:13.536
She likes you.

08:13.579 --> 08:15.276
Yeah, for now.

08:15.319 --> 08:17.192
You ever been in a restaurant,
and a waiter walks by

08:17.235 --> 08:19.889
with fajitas, and you're like,
"Ah, I should've gotten those?"

08:19.934 --> 08:21.891
Just last week.

08:23.067 --> 08:26.288
I mean, she's in the middle of
the ocean with 200 fajitas.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.725
Young, sizzling hot fajitas.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.685
She can't come home
to a chimichanga.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.426
Look, son, you've got
a lot more going for you

08:34.470 --> 08:36.037
than just your muscles.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.341
[sighs]

08:38.386 --> 08:39.519
Like what?

08:40.780 --> 08:41.912
I'll spot you.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.571
We're back!

08:48.615 --> 08:50.399
We have stories![laughing]

08:50.442 --> 08:52.749
Your daughter is such a badass.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.272
Oh, you are the badass.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.187
Hey, babe.Hey.

08:56.230 --> 08:58.232
She inspired me
to go and kiss Brett.

08:58.275 --> 08:59.581
It was so cute.

08:59.625 --> 09:00.714
Did you record it?

09:00.756 --> 09:02.629
You told me not to.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.107
Did you?Yes.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.414
[both laughing]

09:06.457 --> 09:08.764
Hey, you guys hungry?
I made some beef stew.

09:08.808 --> 09:10.071
No, we have sushi coming.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.594
Let's go watch it in my room.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.725
I'll be there in just a second.[Lizzie squeals]

09:13.943 --> 09:16.467
Wow, you two are really
hitting it off.

09:16.511 --> 09:17.947
She is so fun.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.124
Yeah, that's, uh, that's great.

09:20.168 --> 09:22.038
Is this weird for you?

09:22.082 --> 09:23.301
No, it's great.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.432
Great.

09:24.475 --> 09:26.303
Hey, I-I got
the fireplace going.

09:26.347 --> 09:27.610
You want to grab
a glass of wine...

09:27.653 --> 09:29.568
LIZZIE: Lois!Coming!

09:36.663 --> 09:38.054
Hey.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.318
How was your
filthy dog job?

09:41.363 --> 09:42.538
Boring.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.105
All they do is sniff
and look around

09:44.148 --> 09:46.716
like it's the first time
they've ever been outside.

09:46.759 --> 09:48.109
I tried to warn you.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.719
They don't go
in the same direction,

09:49.763 --> 09:52.025
and if another dog walks by,
they all just freak out.

09:52.068 --> 09:54.594
And one of them decided
they were done and took a nap.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.552
Hmm.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.162
Everybody has a bad day.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.510
Tomorrow will be better.

09:59.554 --> 10:01.817
There's no way
I'm doing this tomorrow.

10:01.861 --> 10:04.604
What? You have to.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.649
No, I don't. I'm my own boss.

10:06.692 --> 10:09.609
I quit.
I accept my resignation.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.087
Hazel, I am ashamed of you.

10:11.131 --> 10:12.873
You made a commitment
to those people.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.918
What do you care? You didn't
even want me to do this job.

10:14.961 --> 10:17.442
Uh-uh. You can't just quit
when things get hard.

10:17.485 --> 10:19.356
This is a moment that
will determine your character

10:19.400 --> 10:21.010
for the rest of your life.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.360
In my grandmother's village,

10:22.403 --> 10:23.753
there was a man
who sold shampoo.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.275
Fine, I'll do it.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.235
Good, now sit down.
This is a long story.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.113
Holly being away is harder
than I expected.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.331
Why do you think that is?

10:37.375 --> 10:38.681
I don't know.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.813
I spent months and months
away from Vanessa

10:40.856 --> 10:42.423
when I was deployed.

10:42.466 --> 10:45.470
I totally missed her,
but I was just so busy.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.822
Well, you know what they say,
"War is busy."

10:50.171 --> 10:51.825
Now, I'm at home just

10:51.868 --> 10:55.001
thinking about all the cool
stuff Holly gets to do.

10:55.044 --> 10:56.655
Shooting pistols
off the side of a ship.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.440
Ain't nothing like it.No.

10:58.482 --> 11:00.789
I-I took this Alaska cruise.

11:00.833 --> 11:04.097
They had us hit a bunch of
golf balls at a glacier.

11:04.140 --> 11:05.576
Wasn't the same.

11:07.535 --> 11:10.365
This whole week has been
so weird.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.975
Waiting to hear from her,

11:12.019 --> 11:14.456
wondering what's going on
5,000 miles away.

11:14.499 --> 11:15.892
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.807
Would it be crazy for me to say

11:18.851 --> 11:20.331
that I kind of feel
like I'm a military spouse?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.419
Yes.

11:22.463 --> 11:24.335
Why?

11:24.379 --> 11:26.423
Well, she's not in any danger.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.991
She's coming home next week,

11:29.036 --> 11:31.515
and, uh, she's at a beach.

11:31.559 --> 11:32.822
But you see my point.

11:32.865 --> 11:35.563
I see what you think
your point is.

11:36.607 --> 11:38.914
I never really got
what Vanessa was going through,

11:38.959 --> 11:41.264
but now that I'm living it...

11:41.308 --> 11:42.962
You're not living it.

11:43.005 --> 11:45.355
Yeah, but...

11:45.399 --> 11:47.706
I kind of want to tell her
that I feel it now.

11:47.750 --> 11:52.014
Riley, if you tell Vanessa that,
this will be our last session.

11:52.058 --> 11:53.538
What? Why?

11:53.581 --> 11:54.844
'Cause she'll murder you.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.279
Copy that.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.027
You don't have to follow me.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.725
Yes, I do.

12:05.768 --> 12:07.726
It feels like
you don't trust me.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.553
I don't.

12:09.597 --> 12:12.208
Besides, I could never live
with myself if a dog ate you.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.557
They're not gonna eat me.

12:13.601 --> 12:15.255
If one bites you,

12:15.298 --> 12:16.952
then the others will join in
because you're wounded.

12:16.996 --> 12:18.172
I've seen it.

12:19.433 --> 12:21.566
I keep getting tangled. Ugh!

12:21.610 --> 12:24.134
Less complaining, more walking.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.222
You know, your father
and I would march

12:26.267 --> 12:28.659
for miles and miles
on patrol every day.

12:28.703 --> 12:31.227
And to keep our spirits up,
we'd call cadence as we marched.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.403
Did it help?

12:32.447 --> 12:33.709
Try it.

You keep building character,
I'll catch up.

12:54.294 --> 12:55.817
Cherry pie?Yep.

12:58.298 --> 12:59.429
You stress baking?

12:59.474 --> 13:01.389
What? What does that even mean?

13:01.432 --> 13:03.870
You love to cook, but you only
bake when you're stressed.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.697
That's nonsense.

13:05.740 --> 13:08.004
You always make a cake the night
before you file your taxes.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.397
'Cause you're
my accountant.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.052
Is there something you
would like to talk about?

13:13.096 --> 13:15.663
As a rule, no.

13:16.707 --> 13:18.927
Do you have a problem with me
and Lois hanging out?

13:18.971 --> 13:20.538
[snorts]
No.

13:20.581 --> 13:22.235
Not at all?

13:22.278 --> 13:23.802
[snorts]
Not at all.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.760
[snorts]
Feels like you do.

13:25.804 --> 13:29.373
Why would I? You're two grown
adults, I'm a grown man.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.375
You're happy, she's happy,
everyone's happy.

13:31.418 --> 13:34.465
Happy, happy, happy.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.946
Come on, Dad. Talk to me.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.644
All right, fine.

13:39.687 --> 13:42.385
I'm stressed out and I don't
know why I'm stressed out,

13:42.429 --> 13:44.562
which is, you know, stressful.

13:44.605 --> 13:46.913
I'm gonna check on
my gluten-free pumpkin pie.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.783
Why the hell are you
making a gluten-free pie?

13:48.827 --> 13:51.264
I don't know. Hey, shoo!
Get out of here.Hey.

13:54.136 --> 13:57.096
[knocking on door]

13:57.139 --> 13:58.446
Hey.Hey.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.970
What's up?Can I come in?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.144
Sure.

14:02.188 --> 14:04.625
Cool. Um...

14:04.668 --> 14:08.107
I, uh, got something
I want to tell you

14:08.150 --> 14:09.979
and didn't really want
to do it on the phone.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.720
Okay.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.157
Yeah, my, uh, therapist
told me not to say anything.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.942
I thought they weren't supposed
to tell you what to do.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.292
Yeah, he felt really
strongly about this one.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.293
Maybe you should listen to him.

14:20.336 --> 14:23.687
Yeah, maybe.

14:23.731 --> 14:24.864
Okay.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.474
Good. I'm proud of you.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.171
So here's the deal.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.477
Remember when I was
in Afghanistan?

14:30.520 --> 14:31.870
[clears throat]

14:31.913 --> 14:34.134
You mean that work trip
you were on?

14:34.177 --> 14:36.440
Yeah.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.919
I just want you to know

14:37.963 --> 14:41.663
that I know
what it was like for you.

14:41.706 --> 14:42.969
Sort of.

14:43.011 --> 14:44.840
I-I mean,

14:44.884 --> 14:48.582
I knew it, but now I know it.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.802
Have you been drinking?

14:51.846 --> 14:53.936
No, I actually haven't had
any fluids in two days.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.197
[clears throat]

14:56.634 --> 15:00.812
The point is, I just felt like
I needed to say it 'cause...

15:01.769 --> 15:05.077
...what you did was super hard,

15:05.120 --> 15:09.472
and it's crazy that you never
complained about it.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.086
You're tough.

15:14.086 --> 15:15.914
Thanks.

15:19.701 --> 15:23.835
Okay, well, uh,
I'll get out of your hair.

15:25.402 --> 15:28.057
Okay.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.058
[exhales]

15:32.713 --> 15:34.498
Bye.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.588
Hey, uh, don't freak out,
I'm gonna take a little sip

15:38.633 --> 15:39.938
from the garden hose.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.678
Okay.
[scoffs]

15:47.642 --> 15:50.774
Are you telling me this is
gluten-free? This is delicious.

15:50.818 --> 15:51.951
Yeah, the trick is,

15:51.994 --> 15:53.604
double the butter.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.258
You health nut.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.432
[laughs][timer dings]

15:56.476 --> 15:58.479
Ooh, that's my shoofly pie.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.220
Mm.

16:00.263 --> 16:04.005
So, a little birdie told me
something's bothering you.

16:04.049 --> 16:08.227
This little birdie with
a big mouth and stupid hair?

16:08.270 --> 16:10.533
I don't want you to hide
your feelings from me.

16:10.577 --> 16:11.796
I'm not hiding them,

16:11.840 --> 16:13.494
I don't even know
where they are.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.412
Are you jealous of the time
I'm spending with her?

16:18.455 --> 16:21.457
Oh, it's definitely not that.

16:21.501 --> 16:23.982
You worried we'll talk
about you behind your back?

16:24.025 --> 16:26.636
You mean, like you obviously do?

16:26.681 --> 16:30.727
Art, both of us
really care about you.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.470
[exhales]
Yeah, but...

16:33.514 --> 16:35.777
she lost her mom in high school,

16:35.820 --> 16:39.606
and she's already looking at you
as something more than a friend.

16:39.649 --> 16:41.086
You think so?

16:41.129 --> 16:42.349
Yeah.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.307
She talks
about you all the time.

16:44.350 --> 16:46.831
You guys talk about me
behind my back?

16:46.875 --> 16:48.398
[laughs softly]

16:48.442 --> 16:51.357
She loves you,
and that's obviously gonna grow

16:51.400 --> 16:53.707
because you're amazing.

16:53.750 --> 16:57.494
But, um, it's a lot
of pressure for me.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.105
Why?I don't know.

17:00.149 --> 17:04.153
I mean, if I screw up our
relationship, that's one thing.

17:04.196 --> 17:06.328
But what about Lizzie?

17:06.373 --> 17:07.982
She's 27 years old.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.854
So?

17:09.897 --> 17:13.857
I don't want to be the reason
she loses someone else.

17:16.209 --> 17:18.124
I guess that is
a lot of pressure.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.385
Yeah.

17:21.648 --> 17:24.652
How about this?

17:24.694 --> 17:28.960
You ever do something so dumb
that you screw this up...

17:30.919 --> 17:33.835
...I promise to stay friends
with your daughter.

17:35.923 --> 17:38.361
That helps.

17:38.404 --> 17:39.884
And it's pretty conceited
that you think

17:39.927 --> 17:42.365
you're the only one
who might screw this up.

17:44.888 --> 17:50.112
By the way,
if we ever break up...

17:52.114 --> 17:54.595
...I'm-a be a total mess.

17:57.423 --> 17:58.990
