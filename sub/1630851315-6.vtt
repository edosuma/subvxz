00:12.969 --> 00:14.797
[crowd gasping]

00:14.840 --> 00:17.800
Well, friends, you've seen me
heli-ski in Alaska,

00:17.843 --> 00:21.499
canyon-jump over Bourne George,
climb Mount Everest,

00:21.543 --> 00:25.329
but nothing has quite
prepared me for this.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.027
[crowd cheering]

00:27.070 --> 00:28.854
[whooping]

00:28.898 --> 00:30.595
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:30.639 --> 00:32.945
All-you-can-drink mai tais.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.251
[whoops]
Let's go!

00:34.295 --> 00:36.645
Looking good, Kayla.
Looking good.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.734
Oh...

00:38.777 --> 00:40.301
Sorry, buddy,

00:40.344 --> 00:42.694
[singsongy]:
but you were delicious.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.218
[laughs]

00:44.261 --> 00:45.871
[drumming intensifies]

00:45.915 --> 00:47.699
Ha, ha, ha, ha.Yeah.

Kayla?

01:05.021 --> 01:06.066
Kayla!

01:09.852 --> 01:10.896
[tires screech]

01:13.508 --> 01:14.683
Kayla!

01:14.726 --> 01:16.772
â™ª

01:26.477 --> 01:28.305
How many more minutes
till she's here?

01:28.349 --> 01:30.568
What, Julie bean?

01:30.612 --> 01:32.570
Hey, Alex, give me
the marble polish.

01:32.614 --> 01:35.051
We have marble polish?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.184
Yes. Under the sink,
in the red bottle.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.318
Oh. Fancy.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.407
Didn't you guys, like,
sleep in tents in Afghanistan?

01:43.451 --> 01:44.452
Iraq, please.

01:44.495 --> 01:47.150
You said she'd be here by 0800.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.805
I know, baby.
That is in 0-4 minutes from...

01:49.848 --> 01:51.023
Aloha!

01:51.067 --> 01:52.808
Now.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.853
Aunt Maggie![door closes]

01:54.897 --> 01:57.943
Hey. Hello, my darling.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.162
Hey, Maggie.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.208
Well, it seems I've been missed.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.339
Alex, help her with
her bag, please.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.688
Oh, thank you.

02:03.732 --> 02:04.820
Hi.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.082
Janie.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.779
You're literally saving
my life.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.565
Can you believe I came home
from a dreadfully boring seminar

02:10.608 --> 02:12.871
to find my kitchen
totally flooded?

02:12.915 --> 02:15.135
I had to take a boat
to get to the fridge.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.353
Stay as long as you'd like.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.050
Thank you.What'd you bring me?

02:18.094 --> 02:20.052
Julie, that's rude.No, no.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.490
I like a girl
who knows her worth.

02:23.491 --> 02:24.796
Buying you gifts was
the highlight

02:24.840 --> 02:26.276
of my speaking engagement.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.584
Gen Z-- whoa, boy--
avoid them like the clap.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.064
Except for you, darling boy.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.675
You're perfection.

02:33.718 --> 02:37.679
They're ancient wishing pearls
from the South China Sea.

02:37.722 --> 02:40.203
Very rare and valuable.
So think of all your wishes.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.552
They may come true.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.206
[whispers]:
Say thank you.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.426
Thank you.
Oh.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.819
Coffee?
Yes.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.212
Janie.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.214
So, how are you?
Tell me everything.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.868
How is work? Are you dating?

02:52.911 --> 02:54.435
Have you visited the new wife?

02:54.478 --> 02:55.784
Is she big as a whale?

02:55.827 --> 02:57.655
Slow down, Mags.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.179
No one's coming
to take your prisoner.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.268
We have time.
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.139
I'm just desperate
for adult gossip.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.576
I can't even ask my students
what their favorite food is.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.230
I might trigger an allergy.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.449
[chuckles]

03:08.492 --> 03:11.147
[phone vibrates]

03:11.191 --> 03:13.541
Sorry, Mags. I got to go in.Oh, no.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.499
Never apologize for work.[message sends]

03:15.543 --> 03:17.327
Besides, I'd like nothing more
than to spend some time

03:17.371 --> 03:20.025
with Julie and Alex.A ninja knife?

03:20.069 --> 03:21.331
This is awesome.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.420
It's a kunai, Alex.

03:23.464 --> 03:24.987
It's just hella deadly.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.336
I'll teach you how to throw it.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.599
See? We'll be fine.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.428
[scoffs]

03:34.214 --> 03:35.476
Uh, no, no, no.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.129
This woman here,

03:37.173 --> 03:39.044
last night, was taken?

03:41.046 --> 03:42.700
Oh. Yeah. Taken.

03:42.744 --> 03:43.745
Yeah, yeah, and you saw it?

03:43.788 --> 03:44.789
WOMAN:
Yeah, yeah.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.356
Taken.Uh...

03:46.400 --> 03:47.705
Liam Neeson.

03:47.749 --> 03:51.013
"I don't know
who you are..."

03:51.056 --> 03:54.277
Liam Neeson.
That's not...

03:54.321 --> 03:55.670
Th-Thank you.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.106
Thank you.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.847
[sighs]

04:00.457 --> 04:01.545
What do we know?

04:01.589 --> 04:03.547
Abductee is Kayla Barlow,

04:03.591 --> 04:05.288
28 years old from
Southern California.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.855
On the island with
her new husband,

04:06.898 --> 04:08.160
Lieutenant Adam Parish.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.554
Submariner stationed
out of Point Loma.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.164
On leave for
their honeymoon.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.818
Hotel cameras didn't pick up
anything,

04:13.862 --> 04:16.256
and no other eyewitnesses
besides the husband.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.302
There's 100 people here,
and no one besides the husband

04:19.346 --> 04:21.043
saw a grown woman
get abducted?

04:21.086 --> 04:23.219
No one here saw it,

04:23.263 --> 04:25.308
but possibly thousands saw it
on their phones.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.875
Kayla is an influencer.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.399
Extreme travel space.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.967
Adam was recording
her dancing and...

04:32.010 --> 04:33.273
posting it live.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.970
[tires screech]

04:36.276 --> 04:38.234
ADAM:
Kayla!

04:40.454 --> 04:43.848
Look, I've watched this video
a dozen times.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.328
There's nothing more
I can tell you.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.808
You get a look at his face?

04:46.851 --> 04:48.157
Barely.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.115
What about the license plate?

04:50.159 --> 04:51.639
No.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.642
Can you tell us anything
about him?

04:54.685 --> 04:56.557
He looked like everyone
at the luau.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.298
Aloha shirt.
Khaki shorts.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.342
I didn't even try to help.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.865
Okay. Okay.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.043
Did Kayla have any
bad interactions with locals?

05:05.087 --> 05:09.352
Anyone seem suspicious or off?

05:09.396 --> 05:10.701
No.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.268
Look, we were having
a great week.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.878
Everyone was so nice.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.750
Th-They made a big deal about it
being our honeymoon.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.229
JESSE:
What about back home?

05:17.273 --> 05:18.492
Did Kayla have any issues?

05:18.535 --> 05:19.971
Maybe a jealous ex?

05:20.015 --> 05:21.886
Nothing like that. No.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.975
Your wife has a pretty big
social media following.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.586
What about obsessed fans?

05:26.587 --> 05:30.068
[stammers] Yeah. She gets
weird comments all the time.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.722
Trolls or whatever.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.681
Just...

05:33.724 --> 05:36.248
nothing that seemed
to bother her.

05:36.292 --> 05:39.034
Anything that bothered you?

05:40.035 --> 05:41.602
Look,

05:41.645 --> 05:43.604
it's just not
my world, okay?

05:43.647 --> 05:45.519
I spend months at a time
in a metal tube.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.259
I-I don't even have Instagram.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.740
What exactly do you do
in the metal tube?

05:49.784 --> 05:51.351
I'm the weapons officer.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.398
So you know how to operate
missiles and torpedoes.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.052
And have top secret clearance.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.141
Yeah.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.145
You think this has
something to do with me?

06:05.060 --> 06:06.670
[door lock beeps]

06:06.714 --> 06:09.325
[door opens]You know they have to volunteer.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.719
For what now?To serve on a submarine.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.547
Physical and psychological
testing.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.418
Takes a very particular
mental disposition

06:15.462 --> 06:17.333
to handle that type
of claustrophobia.

06:17.377 --> 06:21.206
Mm, not to mention aquaphobia,
thalassophobia...

06:21.250 --> 06:22.904
I was a late swimmer.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.340
Oh. How late?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.429
It's an ongoing process.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.736
Just-- What do you know
about Lieutenant Parish?

06:28.779 --> 06:30.346
[clears throat][electrical whirring]

06:30.390 --> 06:32.174
He's a weapons officer
on the USS Hemstead--

06:32.217 --> 06:34.437
a Los Angeles Class
Fast Attack sub.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.483
LUCY: That sounds impressive.ERNIE: It is.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.093
But I'm not sure
what the upside is

06:38.136 --> 06:40.443
to kidnapping his wife
in the middle of a luau.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.445
Can't force him
to share intel

06:42.489 --> 06:45.056
with NCIS all
over the case.

06:45.100 --> 06:49.626
Kayla, on the other hand,
is not your average influencer.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.715
LUCY:
No kidding.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.064
She has, like,
actual skills.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.153
Extreme hiking, camping.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.155
Ooh, haggling
in the Jakarta Market.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.853
Well, decorating one's house
and applying makeup

06:58.896 --> 07:00.942
is a skill, Lucy.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.640
Um, the point is,

07:03.684 --> 07:05.686
there are 1,000 comments
in a dozen different languages.

07:05.729 --> 07:08.079
So it's gonna take a beat
to pinpoint likely suspects.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.385
Meanwhile, we have
a getaway car to track.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.604
Yes.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.605
[types][electrical whirring]

07:11.648 --> 07:13.041
Abductor was also skilled,

07:13.084 --> 07:15.260
managed to speed off
avoiding all cameras.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.697
License plate?Nope.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.307
And it's a silver pickup.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.178
One of the most common
vehicles on the island.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.919
Wait, but check out
this windshield.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.269
There's something on the
driver-side visor. You see it?

07:24.313 --> 07:25.836
[typing][electrical whirring]

07:25.880 --> 07:27.751
Some kind of
parking pass.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.884
And a barcode.
I'm running it now.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.363
[whirring]

07:31.407 --> 07:32.800
It's from an automated
ticketing station

07:32.843 --> 07:35.019
at Waikiki Marina.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.544
Three miles from the luau.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.981
Good luck with that aquaphobia.[door opens]

07:40.024 --> 07:42.636
LUCY:
There are 100 boats here.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.289
If our abductor had
access to one,

07:44.333 --> 07:45.726
he could be miles away by now.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.902
Well, we got to start
somewhere.

07:47.945 --> 07:51.035
So, dockmaster says it's been
mostly regulars and tourists,

07:51.079 --> 07:53.168
except yesterday
a mainlander came in,

07:53.211 --> 07:54.952
wanting to charter a boat
for island-hopping,

07:54.996 --> 07:56.954
no questions asked.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.521
Got himself
a "sweet little cabin cruiser"

07:58.565 --> 07:59.870
and overpaid in cash.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.785
Sounds like our guy.
When did he leave?

08:01.829 --> 08:04.309
He didn't. Slip 21.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.101
You all right?

08:13.144 --> 08:16.539
I, uh, don't love boats.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.888
Or the sea.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.804
Or anything water-related,
really.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.285
But you live on an island.

08:23.328 --> 08:24.678
And work for the Navy.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.641
[quietly]:
Someone's inside.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.864
â™ª

08:39.170 --> 08:40.607
Federal agents!

08:45.133 --> 08:47.135
That's not Kayla.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.446
Just check all
these other boats.

08:54.490 --> 08:57.275
See if there's any witnesses.
Thanks.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.364
So, got some cash,

08:59.408 --> 09:03.804
passport, maps,
souvenir shop hat, and...

09:03.847 --> 09:06.023
compact nine-mill.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.895
In with the socks.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.985
Hasn't been fired recently.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.291
According to this,
his name is John Casings.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.466
Judging by the bruising

09:14.510 --> 09:15.903
on his body,
he fought hard

09:15.946 --> 09:17.295
before he died.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.862
You think Kayla
could've done this?

09:18.906 --> 09:21.256
Forensics found her
fingerprints in the cabin,

09:21.299 --> 09:22.692
so she was definitely here.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.607
And CCTV from the marina
shows Kayla running

09:24.651 --> 09:25.695
through the parking lot
headed west.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.523
Being pursued?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.264
Not anyone I could see.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.353
[thunder rumbling]

09:33.050 --> 09:34.704
So, Kayla gets the better
of John Casings.

09:34.748 --> 09:37.185
Kills him in self-defense?

09:37.228 --> 09:39.622
Then why hasn't she called
the police?

09:45.889 --> 09:48.065
What do we know about
our dead guy?

09:48.109 --> 09:50.981
Fingerprints confirm
his name is John Casings.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.680
42 years old,
from Dover, Delaware.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.465
Arrived on the island nine hours
before the alleged abduction.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.990
Rented the pickup, chartered
the boat, and disabled its GPS.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.166
Didn't want anyone tracking
where he was taking Kayla.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.690
No, but we found maps
on the boat,

10:03.733 --> 10:05.430
charting a course
to the Big Island.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.389
Why take her there?ERNIE: No idea.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.260
He's a traveling
insurance adjustor,

10:09.304 --> 10:12.176
and it's the "traveling" part
that's interesting.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.309
Passport records
over the past two years

10:14.352 --> 10:15.832
place him in six out of

10:15.876 --> 10:18.879
the last seven international
locations as Kayla.

10:18.922 --> 10:21.664
Maybe Casings is
an obsessed fan.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.927
Possibly. Do we think
Kayla killed this man?

10:23.971 --> 10:25.581
KAI:
Casings was beaten
before he was shot.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.278
I don't think Kayla's capable.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.063
ERNIE:
She's definitely capable.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.935
I saw a tutorial of her
hunting a wild boar in Romania.

10:31.979 --> 10:35.069
Dressed it,
cooked it over rocks.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.332
What? It was ethical.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.725
She ate every part of it.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.335
And I mean every part.

10:44.339 --> 10:47.429
Maybe someone else
killed Casings

10:47.472 --> 10:49.344
and Kayla's hiding from them.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.912
Follow up with forensics
and the M.E.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.653
See if they found evidence
of another suspect.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.002
Check in with HPD.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.525
See if they're any closer
to finding Kayla.

10:56.568 --> 10:59.484
Ernie...Yep. Get intimate
with John Casings.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.182
Thank you.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.319
Okay, Jules.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.452
How many cards do you want?

11:10.495 --> 11:12.759
I'll take four.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.238
Oh.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.675
Careful. She cheats.

11:15.718 --> 11:16.676
BOTH:
Do not.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.329
[Maggie laughs]

11:20.157 --> 11:22.072
I fold.Oh.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.465
ALEX:
That's it, Jules.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.685
No more slacking
on your homework.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.385
Fine. It's rude to take
all your money, anyway.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.432
So...
Hmm?

11:34.476 --> 11:36.173
You ever kill anyone
with that knife?

11:37.609 --> 11:39.046
No one who didn't deserve it.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.743
Oh!TENNANT: And on that note...

11:40.787 --> 11:42.789
Why don't you go help
your sister?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.446
And now you are going
to eat something.

11:48.490 --> 11:49.970
It smells amazing.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.362
It is amazing.

11:51.406 --> 11:52.712
You know,
I don't remember the last time

11:52.755 --> 11:54.191
someone actually cooked for me.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.063
Boy, you really need
to expand your circle

11:56.106 --> 11:58.848
from retired former bosses to...

11:58.892 --> 12:01.721
I don't know,
handsome divorcÃ©es

12:01.764 --> 12:03.984
who appreciate a woman
with a handgun.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.986
Well, then that
would be less time

12:06.029 --> 12:08.510
of me scrolling through an
alleged victim's social media.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.859
Ah, yes.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.383
Why do young people
feel the need

12:12.427 --> 12:15.604
to share every mundane
detail of their lives?

12:15.647 --> 12:16.953
What ever happened

12:16.997 --> 12:18.825
to privacy, mystery?

12:18.868 --> 12:21.305
Says the former CIA operative.Okay.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.133
TouchÃ©.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.267
What is it, Janie?

12:26.310 --> 12:28.748
These comments. Look.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.793
See how all the words
are misspelled?

12:30.837 --> 12:33.056
It's like English is
a second language.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.190
There's a pattern.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.887
It's in these other
posts as well.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.889
Looks to me like...

12:39.933 --> 12:42.370
Like classic Playfair cypher.Mm-hmm.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.766
She was communicating
to someone in code.

12:48.289 --> 12:52.206
Looks like your young lady just
got a little more interesting.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.295
[typing]

12:54.338 --> 12:56.993
TENNANT:Misspellings, capitalizations
in the middle of the words.

12:57.037 --> 13:00.040
Even the pattern
of the comments.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.737
It's a cypher.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.652
Well, she's also using
different fonts and symbols.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.306
It's a whole language.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.134
What could this woman not do?

13:07.177 --> 13:09.658
TENNANT:
This type of skill doesn't read
like an affair cover.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.182
It reads like
tradecraft.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.576
I've run a search
on several of the accounts

13:14.619 --> 13:16.839
she's communicating with.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.103
They all track
to same IP address

13:20.147 --> 13:21.670
linked to an LLC in Delaware.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.715
That's where
John Casings is from.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.761
What if he wasn't
abducting her...

13:25.805 --> 13:28.372
but meeting her?

13:28.416 --> 13:31.201
â™ª

13:34.901 --> 13:37.468
Pull up the live footage
from the luau.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.080
Let's look at it through the
lens of "they knew each other."

13:42.082 --> 13:43.387
[electrical whirring]

13:43.431 --> 13:44.780
[percussive music plays]

13:44.824 --> 13:46.129
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.783
[Kayla laughs, whoops]

13:47.827 --> 13:49.263
ADAM:
Kayla?

13:50.177 --> 13:51.656
Kayla!

13:51.700 --> 13:53.658
Hey, pause it.
Go back like three seconds.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.619
Right there.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.664
You see Kayla look back
for Adam?

13:59.708 --> 14:00.796
Casings hasn't touched her yet.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.364
ERNIE:
Zooming in.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.366
She recognized him
in the crowd.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.976
I mean, she's even
moving towards him.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.586
But right before
she went to him,

14:08.630 --> 14:10.893
her instinct is
to hide Casings from Adam.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.374
[drumming continues]

14:13.417 --> 14:14.854
So, who's breaking it to Adam

14:14.897 --> 14:16.899
that his new wife is not
what she seems?

14:16.943 --> 14:19.032
BOTH:
Not it.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.338
I don't even think
I'm authorized to do that.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.257
This is the man who took Kayla.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.520
His name's John Casings.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.219
We believe he and your wife
knew each other before the luau.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.482
They were in six different
foreign locations together

14:34.525 --> 14:36.049
over the last two years.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.224
And you found him?

14:37.267 --> 14:38.921
Yes.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.793
He was murdered.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.621
And Kayla fled the scene.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.494
And what?

14:47.799 --> 14:49.584
You think Kayla did it?

14:49.627 --> 14:51.716
She hasn't reached out
to the police.She's scared.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.979
She's in hiding.
I mean, c-can you blame her?

14:53.022 --> 14:54.545
Adam.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.984
There's something deeper
going on.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.724
Possibly criminal.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.990
We believe they've been
communicating in code

15:04.033 --> 15:05.905
through her social media.

15:10.518 --> 15:13.956
No, th-this-this doesn't mean
anything bad.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.089
Kayla loves
puzzles and games.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.917
When I was at sea,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.788
we'd write these novel-long
love letters to each other,

15:19.831 --> 15:21.790
and we'd use Morse code
to say the stuff

15:21.833 --> 15:23.444
that I didn't want
my crew to see.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.750
What kind of stuff?

15:26.795 --> 15:29.972
Mushy stuff, you know,
pet names.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.626
We were apart
for months.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.715
What you're looking at here...

15:33.758 --> 15:35.978
is more than the dashes and dots
of Morse Code.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.762
This is ridiculous. Okay?

15:37.806 --> 15:39.416
You are supposed
to find her,

15:39.460 --> 15:41.592
not accuse her of crimes
that she didn't commit.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.072
Look,

15:43.116 --> 15:46.119
I can't explain
any of this, but...

15:46.162 --> 15:48.382
look, I can guarantee you,

15:48.425 --> 15:51.559
Kayla has nothing to hide.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.257
ERNIE:
Actually,
she has a lot to hide.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.825
For example, of her hundreds
of thousands of followers,

15:56.868 --> 15:58.566
all but 20,000 are bots.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.350
Everyone knows influencers buy
fake followers.

16:00.394 --> 16:01.743
It helps their brand.

16:01.786 --> 16:02.918
Well, maybe,
but are all the bots

16:02.962 --> 16:04.659
controlled by one person?

16:04.702 --> 16:07.009
I back-traced the origin
of the bots,

16:07.053 --> 16:08.793
same as the IP address
of the coded messages.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.187
John Casings is the source.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.537
Casings ran Kayla's
social media business?

16:13.581 --> 16:15.496
Well, that's the thing,
there is no business.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.802
Her sponsors are fake, too.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.718
Any luck deciphering the code?A little.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.199
Best I can figure,
there's a lot of talk

16:23.243 --> 16:24.809
about meeting points,

16:24.853 --> 16:26.246
something about transfer

16:26.289 --> 16:27.682
of "the package."

16:27.725 --> 16:28.944
LUCY:
Could be drugs.

16:30.467 --> 16:34.776
Fake followers, international
travel, coded messages.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.213
This has all the makings
of an intelligence operation.

16:37.257 --> 16:40.303
One where Casings and Kayla
were working together.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.349
Well, if you're right,
we'll know soon enough.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.655
I have been playing
in Kayla's account for two days,

16:44.699 --> 16:46.440
which would set off
all sorts of alarms.

16:46.483 --> 16:49.225
[footsteps approaching]One of which is about to enter.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.140
[door beeps]

16:51.184 --> 16:53.012
Special Agent Tennant.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.317
DIA Whistler.

16:54.361 --> 16:55.971
Your investigation
of Kayla Barlow

16:56.015 --> 16:58.017
and John Casings ends now.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.897
Look, I take
no pleasure...

17:08.940 --> 17:10.333
Oh, you take all the pleasure.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.119
Well, I take very little
pleasure in telling you

17:13.162 --> 17:15.904
that NCIS's services are
no longer needed on this case.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.862
Why would DIA not want our help?

17:17.906 --> 17:19.560
There's no more information
I can give you.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.040
NCIS is officially off the case.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.084
DIA will take it from here.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.304
So, Kayla is a DIA asset?

17:25.479 --> 17:27.002
CIA?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.525
You of all people know
that I can't answer that.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.527
And how is DIA--
or whoever--

17:30.571 --> 17:32.573
gonna find Kayla
and bring her back?

17:32.616 --> 17:34.618
This is no longer...No longer

17:34.662 --> 17:36.446
an NCIS investigation.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.318
I heard you
the first three times.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.102
You know what I think?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.670
I think you're not sharing
a plan to get Kayla back

17:42.713 --> 17:44.411
because there is no plan
to get Kayla back.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.761
Why would you want to leave
your own asset out to dry?

17:46.804 --> 17:49.459
I am not leaving anyone
out to dry.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.505
I'm an officer for
the Defense Intelligence Agency,

17:51.548 --> 17:54.073
following direct orders
to shut down your investigation.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.465
So this is a shutdown.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.730
You had no intention
of bringing that agent in.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.171
I think we're done here.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.434
[pen scribbling]

18:11.002 --> 18:12.874
[door opens]

18:14.310 --> 18:17.096
What are we supposed to tell
Kayla Barlow's husband?

18:17.139 --> 18:18.445
It's not my problem, Lucy.

18:18.488 --> 18:19.794
Yes, it is your problem.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.709
She is an asset,
risking her life.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.580
Her husband is just supposed
to think she disappeared?

18:23.624 --> 18:25.800
I don't work for the department
of distraught husbands.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.454
I'm given orders.

18:27.497 --> 18:28.890
Orders that come
before relationships

18:28.933 --> 18:30.761
and love and feelings.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.590
We still talking
about Kayla Barlow?

18:33.634 --> 18:35.375
Yeah, of course.

18:35.418 --> 18:38.552
Did you think I meant...No, I mean,

18:38.595 --> 18:40.902
you just started talking about
relationships and feelings.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.773
[elevator bell dings]I thought maybe...

18:42.817 --> 18:44.384
No, this is...

18:44.427 --> 18:46.647
It's nothing to do
with what happened between us.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.911
[inhales sharply]

18:49.954 --> 18:51.434
[clears throat]

18:56.526 --> 18:58.876
Hey.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.010
You look like
you could use a drink.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.055
I was taken off the case.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.274
The missing wife?

19:05.318 --> 19:06.493
She's more than
a missing wife.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.190
We've been shut down.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.280
She's a CIA asset.
Ah.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.979
Why leave her out to dry?

19:16.981 --> 19:18.722
I brought you this.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.161
Is that...?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.814
Lebanese arak.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.251
The good stuff.

19:28.558 --> 19:31.213
Where did you find a bottle
of that in Hawai'i?

19:31.257 --> 19:33.868
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.044
Oh, I can smell it from here.Mm.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.960
[music playing faintly]

19:42.355 --> 19:44.400
Ooh, yeah.
Ooh.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.620
I feel like it tasted better
on the base.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.187
Maybe we were just desperate.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.710
[chuckles]

19:49.753 --> 19:51.407
Long desert nights.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.193
So...

19:54.236 --> 19:56.369
you identify
with this young woman.

19:56.412 --> 19:59.241
Just married,
living two separate lives.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.767
"Secrecy is the enemy
to intimacy."

20:03.811 --> 20:05.595
It's what you told me
on my wedding day.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.511
Your job did not end
your marriage, Janie.

20:08.555 --> 20:09.947
It didn't help.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.910
Do you remember Ali Bashir?

20:15.953 --> 20:18.086
He was with us in Bagram.

20:18.129 --> 20:20.262
He raised the chickens?

20:20.306 --> 20:21.872
[chuckles]:
Oh.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.918
I remember you tried to eat
the chickens.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.833
Well, you know,
who can blame me?

20:25.876 --> 20:28.966
How long can a person live
on stewed goat?

20:29.010 --> 20:30.925
[chuckles]

20:30.968 --> 20:32.666
After you left,

20:32.709 --> 20:36.060
we got reliable information
that Bashir had been made.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.628
How?
Who knows?

20:38.672 --> 20:43.198
Al-Qaeda had informants
just everywhere.

20:44.765 --> 20:48.334
But Bashir refused to leave.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.514
He didn't want to abandon
the mission.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.170
A few weeks later,
he disappeared.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.305
Was he killed or captured?

21:03.349 --> 21:04.524
I don't know.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.266
I wanted to look for him.

21:09.442 --> 21:13.097
But Langley said no,
too dangerous.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.449
He was expendable.

21:16.492 --> 21:19.321
We all are.

21:19.365 --> 21:24.195
It's why I'm glad you got out
early, joined NCIS.

21:29.375 --> 21:34.293
I've always regretted
abandoning him like that.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.169
â™ª

21:44.433 --> 21:47.349
No one should be left behind,
Janie.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.789
â™ª

21:58.969 --> 22:00.841
I'm here.

22:02.233 --> 22:05.062
For the HR meeting?
Tennant sent a text.

22:05.106 --> 22:07.282
Yeah, I don't think we're
actually having an HR meeting.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.805
Oh, thank God.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.068
I mean, not that I don't
appreciate the seminars.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.331
Lucy, get the windows, will you?

22:16.509 --> 22:18.119
We're back
on the Kayla Barlow case.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.035
Between us.Were we off it?

22:21.078 --> 22:22.384
You were there
when Whistler shut us down.

22:22.428 --> 22:25.039
Oh, right. That. All right.

22:25.082 --> 22:27.084
Let's get
this HR meeting started.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.869
I looked into Kayla
and John Casings'

22:28.912 --> 22:30.914
shared travel history.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.134
Turns out every time they were
in an exotic locale,

22:33.177 --> 22:35.658
there was a defection
of a high-value foreigner.

22:35.702 --> 22:38.444
KAI:
Nuclear scientist from Iran,
diplomat from China,

22:38.487 --> 22:39.967
dissident from North Korea.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.490
And most recently...

22:41.534 --> 22:43.144
[electrical whirring]Russia,

22:43.187 --> 22:44.928
the wife of an oligarch.

22:44.972 --> 22:47.061
Kayla's a deep cover agent.

22:47.104 --> 22:49.150
John Casings is likely
her handler.

22:49.193 --> 22:50.673
Rushing her out
of the hotel,

22:50.717 --> 22:52.371
getting her on that boat...

22:52.414 --> 22:54.416
all classic signs
of a bugout plan.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.548
How can you be sure?

22:58.159 --> 23:02.076
Before NCIS, I worked
for the "State Department."

23:02.119 --> 23:03.817
Right.
In diplomatic services.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.035
[Ernie clears throat]

23:07.908 --> 23:09.170
Oh.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.345
Right.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.912
You were in H... HR.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.609
Attaboy.

23:13.653 --> 23:15.698
Whoever killed Casings is
likely still after Kayla.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.831
Did you get anything off the
security footage at the marina?

23:17.874 --> 23:19.093
Besides a couple
of skateboarders

23:19.136 --> 23:20.616
in the parking lot,

23:20.660 --> 23:22.270
there are only two people
who aren't linked

23:22.313 --> 23:24.185
to boats in the marina.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.886
It's the Liam Neeson nut.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.497
No, I mean,
I-I know them.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.238
They were at the luau.
English wasn't great.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.023
Get working
on facial recognition

23:36.066 --> 23:38.678
and comb any of our
foreign databases for I.D.'s.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.680
LUCY:
So, if you were a CIA agent

23:40.723 --> 23:43.334
whose handler was just killed,
what would your next move be?

23:43.378 --> 23:45.598
Post a glitchy video
on your socials.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.600
No, really,
Kayla just posted

23:47.643 --> 23:49.993
a glitchy video on her socials.

23:50.037 --> 23:52.082
[distorted waves crashing]

23:53.432 --> 23:54.520
That's not a glitch.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.260
Listen to the sound.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.741
[rhythmic static]

23:58.785 --> 24:00.351
It's dashes and dots.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.570
Morse code.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.311
JESSE:
Like she uses with Adam.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.008
Kayla's trying to contact him.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.492
JESSE:
Yeah, okay.
Keep an eye out for him.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.016
Adam left the hotel
15 minutes ago.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.366
You hear that, Ernie?
Any luck tracing the phone?

24:15.410 --> 24:16.803
ERNIE [over phone]:
Adam's turned it off.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.674
But good news on the Morse code.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.284
"Go see the dolphins."

24:20.328 --> 24:21.547
What?

24:21.590 --> 24:22.809
The Morse code,

24:22.852 --> 24:24.680
it says, "Go see the dolphins."

24:24.724 --> 24:26.334
Dolphins?
What's that code for?

24:27.378 --> 24:29.468
I think it's code for dolphins.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.906
They're on their honeymoon,
seeing all the sights.

24:32.949 --> 24:34.777
Where would they see
the dolphins?

24:34.821 --> 24:36.387
Sea Life Park.

24:37.432 --> 24:38.520
[dolphins squealing]

24:38.564 --> 24:41.001
[crowd cheering]

24:42.045 --> 24:44.134
[cheering]

24:44.178 --> 24:45.875
Eyes open.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.442
Kayla's trained
in countersurveillance,

24:47.486 --> 24:50.010
[over comm]:
so she's gonna be hard to spot.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.533
Can't say the same for Adam.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.796
Got him in a blue hoodie
by the dolphin lagoon.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.450
Should we scoop him up?JESSE [over comm]: Nah, Luce.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.627
We keep an eye on him
to reel in Kayla, the big fish.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.630
Hope that metaphor
wasn't triggering.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.589
[cheering]

25:03.632 --> 25:06.548
JESSE:
This place is packed
like a Fourth of July weekend.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.419
She could easily be watching us
right now.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.770
Or this could all be
a ploy to draw us out.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.079
Not a trick. I got her.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.254
By the seals.

25:17.298 --> 25:18.821
Brown wig. Green backpack.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.606
What's the plan, boss?

25:20.649 --> 25:23.565
Remember that smuggler
at the Maui airport?

25:25.045 --> 25:26.394
You want to pull
a "pack and play"?

25:26.437 --> 25:27.787
Oh, I want to do it, too.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.181
Okay, Kai, stay with Adam.

25:31.225 --> 25:32.443
[water splashes][cheering]

25:36.665 --> 25:38.798
â™ª

25:39.929 --> 25:41.714
[sighs]

25:59.122 --> 26:01.734
A lot of people are
worried about you.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.692
Who are you?

26:04.301 --> 26:05.912
NCIS.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.609
Navy cops?

26:07.653 --> 26:09.480
We're gonna bring you in.

26:09.524 --> 26:12.701
Look, I suggest you walk
out of here calmly.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.877
We can sort this
whole mess out.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.966
[cheering]

26:19.752 --> 26:21.754
[indistinct chatter over P.A.]

26:24.278 --> 26:26.106
Adam.
He's here.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.108
I have an agent on him.ADAM [over comm]: Tennant.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.285
They're making a play for Adam.Grab him, Kai.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.462
[electrical crackling][grunting]

26:36.507 --> 26:38.553
[cheering, whooping]

26:39.946 --> 26:41.643
MAN [over P.A.]:
Yeah! Nice job, everybody.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.210
[groaning]

26:43.253 --> 26:45.081
[softly]:
I'm good.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.345
[water splashes]

26:48.389 --> 26:50.043
[cheering]

26:56.571 --> 26:58.617
Every second I am here is
a second we could be looking

26:58.660 --> 27:01.358
for my husband.And every second you don't
answer my questions

27:01.402 --> 27:03.273
is one less detail I have
to find your husband.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.147
I can't talk to you here.You can.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.018
We sweep the basement level
daily.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.152
Cards on the table.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.632
I'm guessing you're CIA.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.765
I was, too.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.637
I'm also guessing John Casings
was your case officer

27:18.680 --> 27:20.551
and he came to get you
out of a jam.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.858
Am I right so far?

27:24.599 --> 27:26.819
We work in exfil defections.

27:26.862 --> 27:29.169
My extreme travel background
made me the perfect fit

27:29.212 --> 27:31.214
for smuggling people
out of hostile territory.

27:31.258 --> 27:34.827
Hostile territory is not
how I'd describe Hawai'i.

27:34.870 --> 27:37.830
I wasn't working here.
I was just...

27:37.873 --> 27:39.832
[sighs]

27:39.875 --> 27:42.878
We had six successful missions.

27:42.922 --> 27:45.272
The last one didn't go well.

27:48.057 --> 27:50.364
Okay.

27:50.407 --> 27:53.106
What happened
on your last mission?

27:55.108 --> 27:57.023
I was helping an asset.

27:57.066 --> 28:01.331
Wife of a powerful Russian
politician in St. Petersburg.

28:01.375 --> 28:04.073
I got her out,

28:04.117 --> 28:07.163
but I was spotted
by his security detail.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.861
Thought I'd
lost them, but...

28:08.904 --> 28:10.514
Russians made you?

28:13.213 --> 28:15.258
â™ª

28:22.396 --> 28:26.182
This was supposed to be
my last exfil.

28:26.226 --> 28:27.706
I was out.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.230
After we got married,

28:30.273 --> 28:32.145
I wanted to be done
with all this.

28:32.188 --> 28:34.495
The secrets, the lies.

28:34.538 --> 28:35.801
Secrecy...

28:35.844 --> 28:37.759
BOTH:
...is the enemy to intimacy.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.893
Yeah.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.939
And now Adam is, um...

28:44.897 --> 28:47.421
Hey. Stay with me.

28:47.464 --> 28:48.944
Okay?

28:48.988 --> 28:51.730
Why did John Casings take you
out of that luau?

28:53.209 --> 28:55.168
He was trying to protect me.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.779
Got word the Russians
tracked me here.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.346
They want to kill you.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.914
If I'm lucky.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.654
[phone vibrating]

29:08.137 --> 29:10.487
[typing on phone]

29:10.531 --> 29:12.185
WHISTLER:
My phone has been ringing
off the hook.

29:12.228 --> 29:13.664
I was very specific
with my instructions.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.318
Leave Kayla alone.

29:15.362 --> 29:16.972
JESSE:Isn't it a good thing
we found her?

29:17.016 --> 29:18.365
Whistler.

29:18.408 --> 29:20.541
Thank heavens you're here.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.151
We found Kayla.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.371
I'm aware,
and I'm here to get her.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.419
Please.Absolutely.

29:29.463 --> 29:32.335
Let's, uh, go get that
asset of yours right away.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.165
Always a pleasure, Whistler.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.168
This could have been
a big mess, you know.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.562
Big mess. Yeah.
Luckily, we found her.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.433
Sadly, we lost
our sailor.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.480
Oops, not here.
[chuckles]

29:46.523 --> 29:48.874
We picked her up at,
uh, Sea Life Park.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.701
You ever been?
Me, neither.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.660
Really impressive.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.967
Mm-hmm.

29:55.010 --> 29:58.013
It's not just about research
and protecting sea life.

29:58.057 --> 30:01.016
It's really about ocean
conservation and sustainability.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.236
Do you have any idea
where you're taking me?

30:03.279 --> 30:04.715
Mm-hmm.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.761
There's sharks and
sea lions, rays,

30:06.805 --> 30:08.807
giraffes, elepha...
[stammers]

30:08.850 --> 30:10.765
I'd like to take you.What?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.072
To Sea Life Park. A date.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.161
As friends. I really don't care
at this point.

30:15.204 --> 30:19.426
Hey, do you like Ethiopian food?

30:19.469 --> 30:21.254
[sighs]

30:24.170 --> 30:25.606
Oh. That's weird.

30:25.649 --> 30:28.261
I actually have no idea
where they are.

30:28.304 --> 30:29.871
What happened on the boat,
Kayla?

30:29.915 --> 30:31.525
Russians were already on it.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.049
John fought them off,
told me to run, so I did.

30:34.093 --> 30:37.139
Now can we please find Adam?We're going to.

30:37.183 --> 30:39.620
But we're running out of time
before DIA comes to get you.

30:39.663 --> 30:40.751
Who took Adam?

30:40.795 --> 30:42.928
Elite Russian special ops.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.146
Not your typical goons.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.931
Trained all their lives
to blend in.

30:45.974 --> 30:49.543
Their skill set is
torture and assassination.

30:49.586 --> 30:50.979
Russians want info from you.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.374
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was...

30:55.244 --> 30:57.377
They want to know
where my defector is.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.467
So they're using Adam as bait.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.903
To draw you out.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.905
Then they'll kill him.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.907
Not if we get to him first.[door beeps]

31:08.997 --> 31:10.390
Aloha.

31:12.348 --> 31:13.915
I understand you're upset.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.395
We ignored your request.

31:15.438 --> 31:16.918
But it would really
help us to keep Kayla

31:16.962 --> 31:18.528
while we look for our
missing Navy lieutenant.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.356
Not exactly
in a helpful mood.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.837
I get it, but perhaps
in good faith...

31:22.881 --> 31:24.970
No, you do not get it.

31:25.013 --> 31:26.623
There is no good faith.
You played dirty.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.974
Okay, I'm sorry. You're right.

31:29.017 --> 31:30.584
But we have a
situation now.

31:30.627 --> 31:33.195
Adam's in harm's way,
and we need to find him.

31:34.457 --> 31:36.503
ERNIE:
Wait, don't go!

31:36.546 --> 31:38.984
No more games, no more stalls.
I'm done.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.160
[phone vibrating]It's not a stall.
Adam's calling.

31:41.203 --> 31:42.639
What?

31:43.597 --> 31:46.208
On Kayla's phone.
Adam's calling her right now.

31:47.209 --> 31:48.515
What do I do?

31:48.558 --> 31:50.734
Answer it!

31:50.778 --> 31:52.693
Adam? Baby?

31:52.736 --> 31:53.694
ADAM:
Kayla?

31:53.737 --> 31:54.956
Are you all right?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.219
I'm fine, baby. Where are you?

31:57.263 --> 31:59.743
I escaped, but-but I'm hurt.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.571
I need you to come meet me.

32:02.398 --> 32:03.791
Where are you?

32:03.834 --> 32:05.924
The balancing rock
at Kaiaka Bay Park.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.751
You have to come alone.

32:07.795 --> 32:09.797
No idea who we can trust.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.104
I'm afraid.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.541
I'll be there.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.412
I'm coming to get you.

32:16.456 --> 32:17.718
[line clicks]Adam?

32:17.761 --> 32:18.893
Start analyzing the call.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.068
See if you can trace it.Okay.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.591
So we're all clear,
this is a trap.

32:21.635 --> 32:23.115
Yes. We're clear.There is no way

32:23.158 --> 32:24.812
that I'm letting her...I'm getting my husband.

32:25.682 --> 32:27.467
Don't care if it's a trap.
They can take me.

32:27.510 --> 32:28.772
Kayla, no one's gonna take you.

32:28.816 --> 32:29.948
We're gonna come up with a plan

32:29.991 --> 32:31.427
to get Adam safely back,
together.

32:31.471 --> 32:32.733
And, at the same time,

32:32.776 --> 32:34.213
take down an elite
Russian hit squad

32:34.256 --> 32:35.562
operating on U.S. soil.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.391
Real career-making mission.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.179
How is this gonna work?

32:44.223 --> 32:46.529
â™ª

32:46.573 --> 32:48.749
Pohaku Lana'i, otherwise
known as "balancing rock,"

32:48.792 --> 32:50.925
is a perfect spot
to lure Kayla.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.406
Out in the open.
Tourists in and out.

32:53.449 --> 32:55.234
Nowhere to hide backup easily.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.540
And no way Adam will
actually be there.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.325
We have any idea
where they have Adam?

32:59.368 --> 33:01.066
So glad you asked.
Listen to this.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.937
[loud background noise]KAYLA: Where are you?

33:02.981 --> 33:05.157
ADAM:
The balancing rock
at Kaiaka Bay Park.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.941
You have to come alone.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.595
No idea who we can trust.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.031
I'm afraid.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.859
KAYLA:
I'll be there.

33:11.902 --> 33:13.556
What's that sound like?

33:13.600 --> 33:15.515
I-I don't know.
A bad connection?

33:15.558 --> 33:17.560
No, connection's fantastic.
All the bars.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.041
So good, in fact, there are
15 other distinct sounds.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.261
I managed to isolate
specific background noise

33:22.304 --> 33:24.611
from the call.
Got birds, wind,

33:24.654 --> 33:26.439
Adam breathing, but then...[electrical whirring]

33:26.482 --> 33:27.527
I strip all that away.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.746
[water splashing]

33:30.747 --> 33:32.662
Sounds like water.

33:32.706 --> 33:35.013
On an island. Go figure.

33:35.056 --> 33:36.536
Not just water.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.059
A waterfall.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.843
Again. Tropical island.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.715
There are a lot
of waterfalls here,

33:41.758 --> 33:43.499
but listen closer.

33:43.543 --> 33:46.546
[water splashing][engine whirring]

33:46.589 --> 33:48.983
Sounds like some kind of plane.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.811
Yes. A midsized prop plane.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.073
I'm guessing Twin Otter.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.293
Used for skydiving.

33:54.336 --> 33:55.990
Waimea Falls.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.471
WHISTLER:
Are you sure?

33:58.514 --> 34:00.429
No, but when I was a kid,
I used to camp there.

34:00.473 --> 34:02.910
It's secluded.
It's near a skydiving jump site.

34:02.953 --> 34:05.956
And only a few miles
from Pohaku Lana'i.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.002
It's a good place to hide.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.612
Jesse, you and I will take Kayla
to the meet.

34:09.656 --> 34:10.961
Keep an eye on her.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.920
Kai, you and Lucy head
to Waimea Falls.

34:12.963 --> 34:15.009
And find Adam
before the Russians kill him.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.490
Then we grab Kayla and
the rest of the Russians.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.361
Call it a day.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.538
[electrical whirring]

34:22.582 --> 34:24.105
I know what you're thinking.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.455
"What could possibly go wrong?"

34:26.499 --> 34:27.891
No.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.285
I mean, yes.

34:30.329 --> 34:33.593
But I think I have an idea
how I can help.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.423
â™ª

34:37.466 --> 34:39.207
[camera clicks]

34:39.251 --> 34:41.166
[quiet chatter]

34:42.167 --> 34:45.083
Any of these tourists
could be more Russian agents.

34:45.126 --> 34:46.519
I got pictures
of the four agents

34:46.562 --> 34:48.086
we think might be after Kayla.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.351
I'm not seeing any matches yet.

34:52.394 --> 34:53.917
I did the math in my head.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.745
If this goes sideways,
we got no real shot

34:55.789 --> 34:57.138
of protecting Kayla here.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.620
Better not go sideways, then.

35:01.969 --> 35:04.058
Kai, Lucy, you
make it to Waimea?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.451
LUCY:
Yeah, but...

35:05.494 --> 35:07.627
we might have a problem.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.978
KAI:
These were not here
when I was a kid.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.026
â™ª

35:23.556 --> 35:26.124
How are we gonna find Adam
with all these cabins?

35:26.167 --> 35:27.777
We're gonna take it
one by one.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.523
[car doors close]

35:36.003 --> 35:37.700
TENNANT:
Got a positive I.D.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.311
Hey, we got a tango.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.530
Copy that.
Still searching.

35:42.836 --> 35:43.967
Those are the guys?

35:44.011 --> 35:46.013
Two of them, at least.Move in?

35:46.056 --> 35:47.667
No, we need to give Kai
and Lucy more time.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.888
JESSE:
Oh, great.

35:51.932 --> 35:53.716
More potential bystanders.

35:55.544 --> 35:57.633
We got a quick five
for photos and bathroom breaks.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.722
[indistinct chatter]

36:05.946 --> 36:07.904
Not to rush you, guys, but...

36:07.948 --> 36:09.602
But you kind of are.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.212
We're on it.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.346
There. That's the one.

36:14.389 --> 36:16.043
How can you tell?

36:16.086 --> 36:17.827
Only cabin without sand toys
and coolers in front.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.786
Or backpacks or surfboards
or flippers...
Okay, yeah.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.004
Got it. Let's go.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.224
[grunting]

36:23.268 --> 36:25.270
[woman speaking Russian]

36:32.277 --> 36:34.366
[knocking on door]LUCY: Tommy?

36:34.409 --> 36:36.455
Open up.
I left the snacks.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.326
Don't make me call the manager
and get a key.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.546
I just need sandwiches.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.939
Oh, I'm so sorry.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.289
All these cabins
look alike.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.943
Oh, wow, is that a kitchenette?

36:46.987 --> 36:48.467
[grunts]

36:50.208 --> 36:51.905

We got Adam.Copy. Bringing Kayla in now.

37:11.403 --> 37:12.752
[indistinct chatter]

37:16.451 --> 37:17.844
It's about to get messy.

[sighs]

37:31.336 --> 37:33.207
Who are they?

37:34.252 --> 37:36.079
A little gift from a friend.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.433
Adam's on the way back to HQ.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.743
â™ª

37:54.533 --> 37:57.623
So, why is this
the scariest part?

37:57.666 --> 38:00.495
I don't know how Adam's
gonna feel after all this,

38:00.539 --> 38:03.150
but I can promise you,

38:03.193 --> 38:06.327
there is a lot of life
to live after the CIA.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.329
So, what do I do now?

38:08.373 --> 38:10.375
â™ª To say I...

38:10.418 --> 38:12.246
You walk through the door.

â™ª If you can stand
to face the fall â™ª

38:18.992 --> 38:22.996
â™ª With your shaking hands

38:23.039 --> 38:27.609
â™ª Your wound's wide open

38:30.351 --> 38:34.747
â™ª I won't desert you

38:37.140 --> 38:41.231
â™ª We can pass the time

38:45.584 --> 38:49.457
â™ª Counting the seconds

38:49.501 --> 38:52.199
â™ª Let it go by,
let it go by... â™ª

38:52.242 --> 38:54.549
I thought you'd be snuggling
the sea lions by now.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.377
They close at 6:00.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.988
[both chuckle]

38:59.032 --> 39:01.817
Actually, I'm, uh,
I'm here to thank you.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.776
What you did today,

39:03.819 --> 39:07.388
sending a bus full of FBI...

39:07.432 --> 39:10.435
I guess you do work in
the love department after all.

39:11.523 --> 39:13.873
It was the right thing to do.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.831
Yeah, but we didn't make
this whole thing easy on you.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.746
No one does. I'm used to it.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.273
You're lucky, you know.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.840
Lucky?

39:24.884 --> 39:25.841
Your team.

39:25.885 --> 39:28.191
Your boss.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.716
You... you have
each other's backs,

39:30.759 --> 39:33.283
and you still want to get a beer
at the end of the day.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.551
I'm sorry you don't have that.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.643
Yeah, well...

39:44.686 --> 39:46.993
It's not easy
always being the...

39:47.036 --> 39:48.647
the bad cop.

39:51.171 --> 39:53.173
I don't think you're bad.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.351
In fact...

39:59.745 --> 40:02.530
I think you're amazing.

40:09.319 --> 40:10.973
Uh...

40:12.061 --> 40:15.108
So, you want to grab a beer?

40:19.591 --> 40:23.421
â™ª Come light a fire

40:23.464 --> 40:28.251
â™ª When you're ready

40:28.295 --> 40:31.907
â™ª Fallen angels...

40:31.951 --> 40:34.257
[door opens]

40:34.301 --> 40:37.130
[door closes]Sweetheart, I'm in here.

40:38.174 --> 40:39.915
So, how was your day?

40:39.959 --> 40:41.482
TENNANT:
Bad guys in custody.

40:41.526 --> 40:44.180
Kayla and Adam are
safely reunited.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.965
Ah. To be a fly
on the wall

40:46.008 --> 40:47.575
at that reunion.

40:47.619 --> 40:49.403
Been there, done that.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.058
So, what's wrong?

40:52.101 --> 40:53.451
You don't seem pleased.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.410
You know that story,

40:56.454 --> 40:57.759
the one about Bashir?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.155
It bothered me.

41:02.198 --> 41:04.244
So I did some digging

41:04.287 --> 41:08.291
with my friend who's former NSA,
and as it turns out,

41:08.335 --> 41:10.816
Ali Bashir is alive and well.

41:10.859 --> 41:13.079
Lives in Central California.

41:13.122 --> 41:14.907
Still raising chickens,
actually.

41:14.950 --> 41:15.908
Wow.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.910
What a relief.

41:17.953 --> 41:19.520
[sighs]

41:19.564 --> 41:21.435
Maybe it wasn't Bashir.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.437
At my age,
I get confused.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.092
Maybe, or...

41:28.398 --> 41:31.445
...the story was less
of a confession

41:31.489 --> 41:33.665
and more a motivation.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.366
To get me to stay
on Kayla's case?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.550
Okay, and why would I do that?

41:49.594 --> 41:50.769
No reason.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.901
Unless...

41:52.945 --> 41:57.471
Perhaps the order came
from someone.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.518
Say, someone at Langley.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.001
Maybe you're not
as retired as you claim.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.835
Janie, secrets may be
the enemy to intimacy,

42:13.879 --> 42:15.576
but...

42:15.620 --> 42:18.187
they sure are fun.

42:18.231 --> 42:19.667
[chuckles]

42:27.632 --> 42:28.720
Gin?

42:28.763 --> 42:29.764
Your deal.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.566
