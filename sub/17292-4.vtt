<i>Previously on</i> Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:04.129 --> 00:06.590
Neither man is actually
offering you a relationship.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.967
-Is it neither or kinda both?
-[Greg] <i>You sold our house?</i>

00:09.051 --> 00:13.138
I'm giving you half the money so you can
go to school. Your dream school, Emory.

00:13.222 --> 00:16.892
I can't just pick up and move across
the country out of nowhere. I'm not crazy.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.102
This is just a fight. This is a fight.
All couples fight.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.980
-No, and we're not a couple, Rebecca.
-[Rebecca] <i>And it's about me and Greg.</i>

00:22.064 --> 00:25.484
<i>I mean, him and me getting together,</i>
<i>it's the most obvious thing in the world.</i>

00:25.567 --> 00:26.401
What?

00:27.528 --> 00:31.406
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!
What happened? Where are you going?

00:31.490 --> 00:34.785
I am applying to law school!
I don't want to know.

00:34.868 --> 00:39.498
You start this semester.
Nothing can stop you, Paula, not anymore.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.213
Greg, wait, wait, wait!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.966
What happened?
Where are you going?

00:50.801 --> 00:53.387
-To Emory, finally.
-What?

00:53.470 --> 00:57.182
Greg-- Greg, you and I
were gonna start over.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.435
Me seeing you on that bridge,
that was a sign

01:00.519 --> 01:01.979
that we should be together.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.148
I want to believe that.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.819
I do, but that's not
how life works, Rebecca.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.655
There are no signs.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.784
Life doesn't happen to you.
You make decisions.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.746
Right now, I'm deciding
to move forward with my life.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.044
But you can't deny
our feelings for each other.

01:26.128 --> 01:31.592
You and I have had some great moments
together, some of the best of my life.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.304
But, in-between that,

01:35.387 --> 01:39.600
it got confusing and hard
and bad for both of us.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.644
So, you were just gonna leave
without saying good-bye to me?

01:42.728 --> 01:47.190
I couldn't say good-bye.
If I did, I would never leave.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.401
So that means you love me.

I'm gonna move on, just like Paula said.

Eh. Matches not found.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.312
-[laughing]
-Don't be weird.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.231
I'm so sorry to wake you,
Mr. and Mrs. Heather.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.692
Davis. My last name's Davis.
What's wrong with you?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.694
I was in a fire.

13:39.777 --> 13:43.740
[sobbing]
It was so scary. Oh, thank you.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.075
-No. I mean...
-It's okay. It's okay.

13:46.159 --> 13:50.621
Ugh. Okay, Mom, Dad, can Rebecca
crash on the sofa, or whatever?

13:50.705 --> 13:53.041
Of course. I'll go get a blanket.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.501
And I make some mean pancakes.
Heather will tell you.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.670
Oh, well, good. I am kinda hungry.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.049
Well, I was thinking more breakfast,
but sure, why not?

14:01.132 --> 14:02.550
Guys, it's 2:00 a.m.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.053
-Which means it's morning.
-Dad.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.846
Heather, your parents are so nice.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.391
Ugh... yeah.

14:10.475 --> 14:14.312
Do you want strawberry cat ears
or blueberry smiles on those flapjacks?

14:14.395 --> 14:16.147
Get out of my head, you angel.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.233
Both, I'll take both.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.366
Where is she?

14:26.449 --> 14:29.535
She went to work, dear.
She borrowed some of my clothes.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.871
-Why? What's wrong?
-This.

14:33.164 --> 14:36.167

[Rebecca] <i>Well, I was in a love triangle</i>

14:40.421 --> 14:43.007

Are you okay?
Oh, you must be so humiliated.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.290
If I were you,
I would start working on an alias.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.085
Karen, I'm totally fine.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.255
Mine would be Eva Longoria.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.382

-That's already someone.

-Enough of this.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.732
We're not watching this anymore.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.485
Okay, this is gonna blow over
in, like, two seconds.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.195
What are you wearing, by the way?

15:46.612 --> 15:49.115
Mm, it's Heather's mom's clothes.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.367
I can't go back
to my apartment, like, ever.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.119
It's okay. I'll go to your apartment
and get your things.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.538
Memory spirits will not mess
with Mama Paula.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.415
-Thank you.
-Okay.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.502
[sighs]

16:01.586 --> 16:05.089
You don't think
that many people saw this, do you?

16:05.173 --> 16:06.674
Uh...

16:06.757 --> 16:10.052
Like-- Like, Josh and Greg
haven't seen it.

16:10.136 --> 16:14.891
No! No. No, no, no.
I don't think anybody sent it to them.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.896
Hey, forget me. Forget this.
What's new with you?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.773
Me? Uh, nothin'.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.776
Are you sure? Because you seem a little--
I don't know-- distracted lately.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.654
And I want to be a good friend.
Tell me, I'm a good listener.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.324
[voice breaking]
I'm a good listener, so just tell me.

16:31.407 --> 16:37.872
Oh, babe, why don't you go home
and take, like, a personal disaster day?

16:37.955 --> 16:41.626
-No, no. I want to be in the meeting.
-Okay. Are you sure?

16:41.709 --> 16:44.420
'Cause it's a douche company
and Karen's gonna be there,

16:44.504 --> 16:46.839
just talking all about her vagina.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.132
We're just gonna be throwing up.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.968
No, no. It'll make me feel better to work,

16:51.052 --> 16:55.389
and plus, I want to prove
to everyone that I'm okay.

16:56.265 --> 17:00.019
Okay. Is everybody ready
to get their douche on? [laughs]

17:02.813 --> 17:04.315
I am so sorry if I offended.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.816
-That was just--
-Oh, no, no, no.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.861
I am not offended
by the word "douche" at all.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.571
-Oh.
-No. At Miss Douche,

17:10.655 --> 17:13.824
we are very proud of our products
and everything they do for women.

17:13.908 --> 17:16.244
No, we're honored
that women entrust us with the care

17:16.327 --> 17:18.538
and cleanliness of their special parts.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.749
-Ooh.
-Personally, I am a fan.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.918
I've been using your products for years.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.962
-Would you sign my box?
-Her douche box.

17:26.045 --> 17:30.091
Maybe later. Look, we want
to reclaim the word "douche."

17:30.174 --> 17:32.802
We think it could be the cornerstone
of female empowerment.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.846
-Empowerment?
-Yes.

17:35.930 --> 17:40.101
We know that our company's image is retro
and that's why we're rebranding.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.604
We're moving into new market places.
We're redefining ourselves.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.606
Hence, the new facility in Pomona
you're working on.

17:45.690 --> 17:49.068
Yeah. New headquarters, new image,
new us. We are starting over.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.319
Starting over, yeah.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.447
Our name and image are a liability.
We get that.

17:53.531 --> 17:58.995
You know, people sometimes laugh.
They childishly giggle at us.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.039
Let alone all the anti-douching research
funded by Big Vagina.

18:02.123 --> 18:05.751
-No. Nothing worse than Big Vagina.
-Oh, amen.

18:05.835 --> 18:09.422
But when I am done with this rebranding,
no one will laugh at me.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.800
I mean, us... anymore.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.558
You know, um-- you know, rebranding--
you were talking about that--

18:20.641 --> 18:22.935
I'm so fascinated by that
from a business perspective.

18:23.019 --> 18:26.814
Tell me, how does a person or a business
completely change their entire identity

18:26.897 --> 18:28.733
so that everyone forgets
what they were like before?

18:28.816 --> 18:31.152
Well, for us, it starts
with a new marketing push.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.862
We're launching a new Miss Douche logo.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.782
So, instead of an illustration,
she'll be a real woman, flesh and blood.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.201
Probably should not mention blood
when I'm pitching it.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.288
-Anyway, we're looking for her now.
-How are you doing that?

18:42.371 --> 18:43.956
Oh, it's a grassroots viral campaign.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.208
So, the contestants send their photos
to us on Instagram,

18:46.292 --> 18:48.127
the five with the most likes
become the finalists,

18:48.210 --> 18:49.837
and then we pick the winner.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.841
Oh, God. When the world sees
the new Miss Douche on a billboard,

18:53.924 --> 18:56.135
a pop-up ad, or on TV,
they're just gonna say,

18:56.218 --> 19:00.681
"Wow! Look at that new Miss Douche.
She really has her act together."

19:08.105 --> 19:11.400
Paula, Paula. Can you do all the research
for the permitting for Trina's case?

19:11.484 --> 19:14.320
I need you to pull blueprints,
file motions, set hearings--

19:14.403 --> 19:17.657
Uh, uh, uh, I can't do those things.
I'm not a lawyer.

19:17.740 --> 19:18.783
But you basically are.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.869
And you're the only person
I would trust to take this over.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.580
Listen, I have to recuse myself
from the case.

19:24.664 --> 19:28.751
-I have a conflict of interest.
-What are you talking about?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.462
Paula, I need to become a douche.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.216
Miss Douche!

19:39.679 --> 19:41.180
-[clattering]
-[Scott] Ow!

19:41.263 --> 19:44.433
Ugh! This Miss Douche case
is so complicated.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.645
Look at us, dividing up
our domestic duties.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.272
Are you cooking or doing inventory?

19:50.356 --> 19:55.486
Oh, I'm making bacon-wrapped chicken
and, uh... [exhales] it's hard.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.406
Babe, I see what you're doing here
and I really appreciate it.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.035
[sighs] You're trying to show me that
I can go to law school and have a baby,

20:03.119 --> 20:05.246
and that our lives can still work.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.416
Exactly. See? I'm crushin' it.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.584
[chuckles]

20:10.668 --> 20:14.171
Tommy, Brendan, dinner!

20:17.341 --> 20:22.430
Tommy! Tommy! Where the hell is Tommy?
I'm gonna count to three, young man!

20:22.513 --> 20:25.558
Don't let me get to three! One! Two!

20:25.641 --> 20:31.397
Oh, I completely forgot to pick up Tommy.
Shoot! Uh, Brendan, go get Tommy.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.940
But my license is suspended again.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.568
Just go get him. Uh, take the back roads.

20:38.904 --> 20:44.452
So I, uh... I need a little practice
in the domestic arts, but I'll get there.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.413
Honey, I'm gonna call the law school
tomorrow and tell them that I can't go.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.124
We are overwhelmed on our best day.

20:50.207 --> 20:55.212
And we cannot add a baby
and law school to this.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.673
But you love law and you're good at it.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.009
And you have the perfect name
for a lawyer.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.761
"Paula Proctor, Esquire."

21:01.844 --> 21:05.473
The only better job would be
"Paula Proctor, Doctor."

21:05.556 --> 21:08.726
Stop it. We have made a decision...

21:08.809 --> 21:10.936
and we need to stop talking about it.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.485
Now, let's eat around some chicken.

21:20.446 --> 21:24.033
So, it's a contest to see
who will be the new Miss Douche.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.036
-A contest. Wonderful!
-I love Miss Douche. It's been around since I was a kid.
My mother used it.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.957
She always smelled like a salad.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.251
-Exactly.
-Ew. This whole thing is dumb.

21:34.335 --> 21:37.171
The only thing grosser than a douche
is an Internet contest. Heather, I need to do this, okay?
I need to rebrand.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.968
My 911 video is up to ten thousand hits,

21:43.052 --> 21:45.679
and everyone I've ever met
is now texting me, saying things like,

21:45.763 --> 21:47.515
"Are you okay? I saw the video."

21:47.598 --> 21:49.517
I need to change the narrative.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.437
If I'm Miss Douche,
then everyone will know that I'm okay. Everyone! Josh and Greg and Audra Levine
and my mother and my garbage father--

21:57.441 --> 21:58.275
just everybody.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.694
So, you want everyone to see you
as a douche.

22:00.778 --> 22:04.615
-Honey, you're not being supportive.
-I'm repeating what she said.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.993
Okay, let's see who has the most likes.
Help me scope up the competish.

22:09.245 --> 22:13.457
So, these are the girls
who have the most likes so far. Okay.

22:13.541 --> 22:14.959
And... all right.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.378
Okay, there's that girl.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.425
-Mm-hmm. This is not for you.
-What do you mean?

22:23.509 --> 22:27.263
They all look like gorgeous mermaids
who grew feet and went to Coachella.

22:27.345 --> 22:30.099
-Well, I could look like that.
-Sure, if you had five years,

and different DNA.

22:32.434 --> 22:36.647
-[Mrs. Davis] Honey, that's not nice.
-Heather, you are smart but wrong.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.357
I can look like that.
All I need is one thing.

22:41.110 --> 22:44.405
I need what every girl needs
after a breakups.

I'm in the top ten for Miss Douche.
Oh, my God, I'm so close.

Okay, honey, I know you are really sad
that Josh and Greg dumped you,

24:48.904 --> 24:51.407

a classic post-breakup makeover.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.508
I know that.
This isn't just about Josh and Greg.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.302
This is about feeling good about myself.

25:12.386 --> 25:16.974
I mean, I finally feel, Paula,
like I've found the true authentic me.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.726
[laughs]
Authentic.

25:18.809 --> 25:21.519
Yeah, so authentic that you've stapled
a horse hair to your head.

25:21.603 --> 25:25.482
Okay, you sound real stupid
because it's not staples, it's glue.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.861
And it's not horse hair,
it's dead people hair, so...

25:31.363 --> 25:33.531
Oops. Sorry.

25:33.615 --> 25:38.954
I need some more glue,
not staples. So, BRB.

26:01.268 --> 26:05.522
-Oh, hey, Josh!
-Um, hello, miss.

26:05.606 --> 26:09.318
No, Josh. Josh, it's...
It's me. It's Becks.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.405
Oh. Wow.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.867
Rebecca? You look so...

26:16.950 --> 26:18.619
so...

26:19.495 --> 26:20.913
Look at you.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.540
I know, right? It's great.
I'm doing this contest.

26:23.624 --> 26:26.376
And did you not see my Instagram pic
of my makeover?

26:26.460 --> 26:29.171
It said #alwayshydrate?
I haven't checked all the likes.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.715
There are so many likes,
so I couldn't tell if you were on there.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.759
Oh, I haven't been online for a while.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.678
I'm on an Internet cleanse.
I do it every once in a while.

26:36.762 --> 26:41.767
Sometimes, there's crazy stuff online
that bums me out. You know what I mean?

26:41.850 --> 26:45.062
Josh, if you're talking about
that 911 phone call and the fire,

26:45.145 --> 26:48.440
I've been meaning to tell you, I wasn't
screaming, "Josh, Greg, Josh, Greg!"

26:48.524 --> 26:51.151
That wasn't about you.
That was about my good friend, Josh-Greg,

26:51.235 --> 26:52.820
with whom I went to both Harvard and Yale,

26:52.903 --> 26:56.448
and he's in a really bad place
'cause his cousin just died.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.283
What 911 call?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.535
I was talking about people

26:59.617 --> 27:01.912
who post pictures of polar bears
on melting ice caps.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.038
What fire?

27:03.914 --> 27:06.458
Oh, so you didn't hear about, uh, the--

27:06.542 --> 27:10.379
It's-It's-- Oh, my gosh. It was--
No, no, no, it's not-- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.382
And you're in a contest.
Is it a costume contest?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.552
Is that why you're wearing
a funny costume?

27:17.845 --> 27:21.557
Uh, no, it's not... it's not a costume.
This is, um... This is how I dress now.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.809
This is my new... my look.

27:25.602 --> 27:26.979
Oh, um...

27:27.062 --> 27:28.897
Rebecca, I'm sorry.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.901
You know, whatever you're going through
right now, it'll get better.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.695
I promise.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.781
Okay, but it can't get better
when it's already the best.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.118
Take care, Rebecca.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.579
Cool. I don't need
taking care of, though, so...

27:51.420 --> 27:54.506
-[moans]
-Get up. Get up!

27:54.590 --> 27:56.967
-You've been sleeping for, like, two days.
-Ah!

27:57.050 --> 27:59.636
Your expensive bots pushed
your likes over the edge.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.597
Dude, you made it into the finals.

28:01.679 --> 28:04.975
So, like, get up
and go to your dumb contest.

28:05.058 --> 28:08.645
-Try to be Miss Douche, you idiot.
-Wait, I made it?

28:08.729 --> 28:10.606
-Yeah.
-Oh.

28:10.688 --> 28:14.026
Oh, yeah, I was a pretty hot girl.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.320
You know, it doesn't matter
'cause I give up.

28:16.403 --> 28:19.489
What? You can't give up.
You put in all that stupid effort.

28:19.573 --> 28:22.075
Rebecca, here. I made something for you
with a special cookie cutter

28:24.745 --> 28:26.330
and lots of love.

28:26.413 --> 28:27.831
Thank you, Mr. Heather.

28:27.915 --> 28:31.335
She's refusing to go to her dumb contest.
Tell her that she has to go.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.671
I don't know, honey.
She really seems like she wants to quit.

28:34.755 --> 28:38.508
Rebecca, sweetie, you don't have
to do anything you started.

28:38.592 --> 28:40.761
-Oh, yay.
-No. What?

28:40.844 --> 28:44.765
She permanently damaged her appearance,
and she needs to see this thing through.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.934
We never made you do that, honey.

28:47.017 --> 28:49.353
Yes, you tried a lot of different things,

28:49.436 --> 28:52.314
and we supported you every time
you wanted to quit something.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.609
We still have all the musical instruments
you only played for a week.

28:55.692 --> 28:59.029
Mm, you guys are talking so loud.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.198
-Okay, no. No! Get up!
-No!

29:01.281 --> 29:03.033
-You get up!
-[moans]

29:03.116 --> 29:07.037
You wanted to show the world you were okay
after that embarrassing 911 video,

29:07.120 --> 29:08.455
so come on, let's go!

29:09.373 --> 29:11.041
That's disgusting!

29:11.124 --> 29:13.835
Girl, get your hair glue
and let's <i>vámonos,</i>

29:13.919 --> 29:17.673
which is the only word I know in Spanish
'cause I only took it for a week.

29:19.591 --> 29:24.680
[woman] <i>Our next contestant</i>
<i>is Melanie Muñoz from Fort Lauderdale.</i>

29:29.393 --> 29:33.689
Ms. Muñoz, do you yourself use
the Miss Douche product?

29:33.772 --> 29:36.692
Absolutely.
Freshness is so important to me.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.652
It gives me confidence to go about my day,

29:38.735 --> 29:41.029
knowing I don't have
any unnecessary bacteria.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.492
So, I feel free and relaxed. And free.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.539
Okay. Rebecca Bunch.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.916
[applause, cheering]

29:53.000 --> 29:54.251
Whoo!

29:58.839 --> 30:00.382
Well, Ms. Bunch...

30:00.465 --> 30:03.927
we, at Miss Douche, were surprised
to see you enter this competition

30:04.011 --> 30:06.805
knowing you
and knowing your background.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.933
You are a most unusual candidate.

30:10.017 --> 30:13.103
An Ivy League education,
a full-time career,

30:13.186 --> 30:16.023
and yet, you still say
you have time to be a, um...

30:17.190 --> 30:21.153
"mad chill SoCal sun soaker."

30:22.029 --> 30:24.489
Yes. Um...

30:24.573 --> 30:27.326
Well, I would say

30:27.409 --> 30:31.496
that I try to be everything
a modern woman should aspire to be.

30:31.580 --> 30:36.335
Um... sort of a cross
between Beyoncé and Sheryl Sandberg.

30:36.418 --> 30:39.921
Well... But we want to know
more about the real you.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.173
What drives you?

30:42.132 --> 30:43.633
Well, I guess what I'm saying is...

30:44.885 --> 30:47.387
Who are you, Rebecca Bunch?

30:49.222 --> 30:51.391
[Greg]
<i>Yeah, who are you, Bunch?</i>

30:51.475 --> 30:53.602
[Josh]
<i>Yeah, who are you, Becks?</i>

30:53.685 --> 30:55.604
Uh...

30:58.440 --> 30:59.524
Good morning, Your Honor.

30:59.608 --> 31:02.736
You don't have to call me "Your Honor."
I'm a planning manager, not a judge.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.613
Yes, Your Honor. Sorry.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.992
I am Paula Proctor
from Whitefeather and Associates,

31:09.076 --> 31:12.162
representing
Miss Douche Incorporated, LLC.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.000
I have submitted my client's plans
for a facility in Pomona,

31:17.084 --> 31:19.169
which houses the lab
and offices of 240 employees--

31:19.252 --> 31:20.712
Ms. Proctor, could you slow down?

31:20.796 --> 31:23.131
I understood
every other word you just said.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.887
So, the facility can be zoned
for mixed use

31:28.970 --> 31:34.184
and thereby be covered under
the light industrial zoning provisions.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.561
And that is all, Your Honor.

31:36.645 --> 31:41.400
Sorry. Sorry. That is all, sir.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.151
[exhales]

31:44.569 --> 31:47.030
Ms. Proctor, just going through
your paperwork here,

31:47.114 --> 31:49.783
and I don't see an Esquire
behind your name.

31:49.866 --> 31:53.078
[inhales]
Um...

31:54.371 --> 31:56.665
-Uh...
-You're not an attorney, are you?

31:57.833 --> 31:59.334
Um...

31:59.418 --> 32:01.378
Then who are you, Ms. Proctor?

32:02.838 --> 32:04.297
[high-pitched voice]
Um...

32:04.381 --> 32:05.924
[Rebecca]
<i>Who am I?</i>

32:06.007 --> 32:10.011
-Yes, we've asked you three times now.
-Right, right. Um, but...

32:10.095 --> 32:12.389
it's hard because...

32:12.472 --> 32:15.392
I've been trying
to figure that out myself.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.477
Um...

32:17.561 --> 32:20.439
I think what you're asking is, uh...

32:20.522 --> 32:23.900
"Do I deserve to be Miss Douche?"

32:23.984 --> 32:26.319
This morning, I didn't think so.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.948
Nope. I, um... I'm only here because...

32:30.031 --> 32:31.825
because of my friend Heather.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.160
She's right there. Yeah.

32:33.243 --> 32:36.788
She reminded me of why
I entered this contest in the first place,

32:36.872 --> 32:41.209
which was to show the world that I'm okay.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.631
But I'm not okay.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.134
No, um...

32:50.594 --> 32:52.429
The truth is, I'm heartbroken.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.557
And if you'd like proof of this...

32:56.641 --> 33:02.022
you can see my, um-- as YouTube calls it--
"crazy lady 911 phone call"

33:02.105 --> 33:03.398
all over the Internet.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.568
Wow.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.320
[chuckles]

33:08.403 --> 33:10.614
I don't deserve
to be Miss Douche. I-I don't.

33:10.697 --> 33:15.202
I-I'm not, like, chill and cool.
And I'm just-- I'm not.

33:15.285 --> 33:17.537
You should find someone
who's like that, like my friend Heather.

33:17.621 --> 33:20.290
She's like that, but I'm... I'm not.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.334
So, um... peace and love. Ugh.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.962
You can turn off the spotlight.
You don't need...

33:26.046 --> 33:27.422
Really, please don't.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.883
Can you just put it...? Okay.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.847
Wow.

33:37.599 --> 33:38.642
So...

33:40.227 --> 33:41.228
Who-- Who are you?

33:42.646 --> 33:44.481
Um...

33:44.564 --> 33:46.233
I'm a student.

33:46.316 --> 33:47.567
Okay.

33:49.069 --> 33:52.155
You caught me. I am not a lawyer.

33:53.573 --> 33:57.244
I wanted to be one.
I was even gonna go back to school.

33:57.327 --> 34:00.080
Yeah. Um, but that's, uh...

34:00.163 --> 34:02.499
that's not gonna work out for me.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.459
But, um, listen...

34:04.543 --> 34:08.338
I did work really hard on this case, sir.

34:08.421 --> 34:11.716
I even let my husband serve raw poultry
to me and my children. Okay?

34:11.800 --> 34:15.345
I wrote a hundred-page brief.
It is really good.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.097
And it supports everything I just said.

34:17.180 --> 34:20.058
So, if you could--
if you could just read it...

34:20.141 --> 34:21.184
Please.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.521
I already did.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.569
And you're right. You did a great job.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.572
Better than most lawyers
that appear before this board.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.906
Most of them just phone it in.

34:34.990 --> 34:37.450
I'm going to grant your petition.
Well done.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.327
Thank you.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.538
If you ask me, you'd make
a damn good attorney.

34:41.621 --> 34:45.917
"Paula Proctor, Esquire."
It's got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

34:51.006 --> 34:53.842
[door opens, closes]

34:59.347 --> 35:00.849
[exhales]

35:14.029 --> 35:17.157
I'm sorry. I just-- I wanted
you guys to be proud of me.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.660
You participated. You should get
some sort of certificate for that.

35:20.744 --> 35:24.205
At least, a ribbon, if not a trophy.

35:24.289 --> 35:28.418
That's a great idea, honey. We'll stop
and get you a ribbon on the way home.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.003
Home. Yes, okay.

35:30.086 --> 35:34.424
So, here's the thing, guys,
it's been so fun, but...

35:34.507 --> 35:38.553
I think I need to move on.
But I'll still see you around, I promise.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.348
You're just saying that.
That's just a thing people say.

35:41.431 --> 35:44.100
No, no. I mean it.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.602
Bring it in, Heathers.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.145
-Oh...
-Come on.

35:50.482 --> 35:54.361
At least, we still have Heather.
She'll need us for the rest of her life.

35:54.444 --> 35:59.407
-Come on, honey. Let's go home.
-Um... no, sorry, I'm moving out, too.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.077
-What?
-Guys, I won.

36:04.329 --> 36:08.124
-Um, sorry, what did you win?
-I am Miss Douche.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.294
It's so weird. I won ten grand

36:11.378 --> 36:13.922
and a lifetime supply
of walnut bark douches.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.217
You won something?
Honey, she won something!

36:17.300 --> 36:19.219
How is that even possible?

36:19.302 --> 36:23.473
And there's the problem... right there.

36:23.556 --> 36:27.394
Mom, Dad, I love you guys very much,
but you reward failure,

36:27.477 --> 36:30.021
and that's why I still live at home.

36:30.105 --> 36:32.899
Also, I like the neighborhood.
So many trees.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.192
Come on, Rebecca. Let's go.

36:35.235 --> 36:37.529
We have to start looking
for a place to live.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.905
Wait, you want to live with me?

36:38.988 --> 36:42.117
You've spent the last few days
insulting every one of my decisions.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.786
Yeah, exactly. You need me really badly.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.539
But I don't have any credit,
so you're gonna have to co-sign.

36:47.622 --> 36:48.665
I hope you don't mind.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.001
I have so many questions.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.217
You feeling okay?

37:01.344 --> 37:03.096
Yeah, not too bad.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.433
Doctor said you might need
to rest up for a bit.

37:06.516 --> 37:10.645
I was gonna make you dinner, but I figured
you've been through enough today.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.855
So, I'm ordering pizza.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.148
Oh...

37:13.231 --> 37:15.817
-You're the best. Thank you.
-[doorbell rings]

37:15.900 --> 37:18.862
[Brendan] Mom, I'll get it
since you just had an abortion!

37:18.945 --> 37:21.281
You're a good son, Brendan!

37:24.659 --> 37:27.162
I love you, Paula Proctor, Esquire.

37:28.830 --> 37:32.041
-I love you, too, honey.
-Mom, it's Rebecca!

37:36.796 --> 37:39.174
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.508
Oh, wow!

37:40.592 --> 37:42.552
Oh, thank God you're not blonde.

37:42.635 --> 37:45.221
-I thought you liked it.
-Yeah. Oh, no, I kinda did.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.807
I did. It's just...
Oh, it just wasn't you.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.142
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.395
So, Darryl said you called in sick.
Are you okay?

37:53.188 --> 37:55.440
Yeah. Yup. I'm okay.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.736
Look, I know something's
been up with you lately.

37:59.819 --> 38:03.114
And I want to know what it is, really.
I mean it this time.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.534
I just...

38:11.706 --> 38:14.167
You know, I had a thing.
I figured it out.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.336
I'm just so happy to see you.

38:16.419 --> 38:20.465
Oh, God. You just--
You seem so much better.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.217
Yeah...

38:22.300 --> 38:25.011
You know, I realized
that I was trying to change my outside

38:25.094 --> 38:27.263
instead of my inside.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.599
It's exactly what I did
with Josh and Greg, you know,

38:29.682 --> 38:32.393
letting outside relationships define me.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.021
And I'm not gonna do that anymore.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.274
Well, that is very wise, my dear.

38:39.442 --> 38:44.364
I know Josh and I shouldn't be together,
and I know that Greg's in a better place.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.075
Atlanta. He didn't die. Um...

38:47.158 --> 38:48.409
I know that.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.246
But I just wish
I could stop thinking about him.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.082
And I think I know how.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.253
Hello?

38:59.504 --> 39:01.089
Anyone here?

39:02.340 --> 39:03.466
Greg?

39:04.300 --> 39:06.344
Ghost Greg?

39:07.303 --> 39:09.681
Am I just talking to myself?

39:11.015 --> 39:12.517
Great. I hate that.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.689
Hey.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.649
Hey.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.278
You're still here.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.115
-Because you're still thinking about me.
-Right.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.659
So, about that...

39:31.119 --> 39:32.996
I need you to go.

39:33.079 --> 39:37.250
Uh... I did. I got on a plane.

39:37.333 --> 39:41.087
No. I mean imaginary you.

39:41.170 --> 39:45.049
I need you to stop haunting me.
I need you to get out of my head.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.430
I understand why you had
to leave West Covina, and...

39:51.556 --> 39:54.559
Someday, I will be happy for you.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.687
But, just for now...

39:58.605 --> 40:03.026
I need you to leave here... and here.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.028
But I can stay with you.

40:05.111 --> 40:09.699
So when you see tacos, or you watch
the dog show, you'll think of me.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.743
No, I don't want that anymore.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.245
I need to move on.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.832
We have to say good-bye.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.793
Are you sure? Good-bye, Greg.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.734
Good-bye, house!

40:51.032 --> 40:52.825
[Heather]
<i>To letting go of the past.</i>

40:52.909 --> 40:55.161
To letting go of the past.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.789
Good-bye to my parents
and your terrible boyfriends.

40:57.872 --> 41:01.501
-Right, although you did also date Greg.
-Meh...

41:01.584 --> 41:03.127
All right. What do you think
of this house?

41:03.211 --> 41:06.005
It's $50,000 a month and it's in Bel Air.

41:06.089 --> 41:07.757
But it has a bowling alley.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.134
Mmm... no.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.054
Okay. Never mind. It doesn't matter
what house we live in.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.139
We're gonna have so much fun, roomie.

41:15.223 --> 41:18.768
-Oh, yeah. Antics will be had.
-Oh, no, I don't antic.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.645
-Come on.
-No.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.565
OMG. Sorry. For a second,

41:24.649 --> 41:27.777
I thought that person housing
that donut over there was Valencia.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.113
What? No. Valencia would never eat a...

41:32.198 --> 41:34.617
Oh, my God, it's Valencia.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.285
Run, run, run.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.162
Run, run.
