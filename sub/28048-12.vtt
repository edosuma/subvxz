00:01.551 --> 00:07.034
Previously on
"Survivor," at tribal council,

00:07.068 --> 00:08.620
Devens saved himself.

00:08.655 --> 00:13.413
I would like the play this
Hidden immunity idol for myself.

00:13.448 --> 00:17.275
But victoria, lauren,
Gavin, and aurora had a back-up.

00:17.310 --> 00:18.896
Plan.

00:18.931 --> 00:23.827
Ron, the tribe has spoken.

00:23.862 --> 00:27.586
And ron grabbed the torch and
Headed to the edge of.

00:27.620 --> 00:35.620
Extinction.

00:40.896 --> 00:43.137
Well, that went especially
Well considering we weren't.

00:43.172 --> 00:45.103
Together on that.

00:45.137 --> 00:48.275
The last tribal council I
Blindsided ron.

00:48.310 --> 00:50.758
That was probably the most guilt
Y I have felt voting.

00:50.793 --> 00:52.931
Someone out.

00:52.965 --> 00:57.689
I felt like I had to separate my
Heart from the game.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.103
I saw those rones.

01:00.137 --> 01:05.137
Now that he's gone, I think
All the focus just went straight.

01:05.172 --> 01:07.896
Toward devens, because you know
Devens is the idol and advantage.

01:07.931 --> 01:08.827
King right now.

01:08.862 --> 01:11.275
Devens needs to go home.

01:11.310 --> 01:13.275
Do you know who sent you that
One?

01:13.310 --> 01:14.424
I don't know who sent it.

01:14.448 --> 01:16.113
It just said, "This came from
The edge of extinction."

01:16.137 --> 01:19.310
I told everyone I got the idol
From edge of extinction instead.

01:19.344 --> 01:21.758
Of vata beach.

01:21.793 --> 01:27.551
I want to be the only one out
Here grinding and working to.

01:27.586 --> 01:28.206
Find the idols.

01:28.241 --> 01:31.068
That was anonymous?

01:32.551 --> 01:33.241
For real?

01:33.275 --> 01:34.517
It came from the edge.

01:34.551 --> 01:37.310
If they think all advantages
Come from the edge of.

01:37.344 --> 01:39.689
Extinction, that plays right
Into my hands.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.413
I think I'm still on the bottom.

01:41.448 --> 01:44.620
No one is coming to work with
Me, sap maybe julie because she.

01:44.655 --> 01:46.000
Was blindsided.

01:46.034 --> 01:49.689
I will have to get really clever
In any other way I can.

01:49.724 --> 01:52.034
Manipulate the game.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.206
That was a good night.

01:53.241 --> 01:57.034
That was a good night.

01:57.068 --> 01:59.448
The trash that came out.

01:59.482 --> 02:02.344
At this point I'm happy.

02:02.379 --> 02:06.586
I felt outcasted before, but
Now, for the first time, there.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.103
Are people I can work with.

02:09.137 --> 02:13.862
My alliance right now is between
Victoria, lauren, gavin, and.

02:13.896 --> 02:16.206
Myself.

02:16.241 --> 02:18.758
All the advantages are gone.

02:18.793 --> 02:24.448
You know, I truly do feel
Connected with my alliance, but.

02:24.482 --> 02:27.758
Devens is a threat, and it's
Going to be more difficult than.

02:27.793 --> 02:29.517
We thought to get him out.

02:29.551 --> 02:33.172
And so devens is target number
One.

02:33.206 --> 02:41.206
I want him out!

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074

02:50.241 --> 02:53.137
At tribal last night, ron
Went home.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.586
That was great.

02:54.620 --> 02:58.551
But if I hadn't had that idol,
It was me going home.

02:58.586 --> 03:02.551
I know the only way I'm getting
The final three is if I work and.

03:02.586 --> 03:10.586
Get myself there.

03:14.344 --> 03:15.517
The early bird gets the worm.

03:15.551 --> 03:17.172
I have to find it before anyone
Else.

03:17.206 --> 03:20.344
To get to the end of the game,
Like I'm going to have to do it.

03:20.379 --> 03:21.275
Alone.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.655
Are you worried about devens,
You guys?

03:23.689 --> 03:24.482
I am.

03:24.517 --> 03:26.482
I'm always worried about Devens.

03:26.517 --> 03:27.241
He's looking.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.034
He's going to be looking all
Day.

03:29.068 --> 03:31.448
One of us just needs the stay
With him.

03:31.482 --> 03:32.965
Rick is a huge liar.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I mean, he didn't get gifted an
Idol from distinction.

03:36.034 --> 03:38.482
He found the idol.

03:38.517 --> 03:42.482
He was lying about the idol.

03:42.517 --> 03:43.448
I can tell.

03:43.482 --> 03:45.896
I think he found it here.

03:45.931 --> 03:50.827
I have the hidden immunity
Idol from the original manu.

03:50.862 --> 03:52.000
Beach up my sleeve.

03:52.034 --> 03:55.034
So I know that idols do come
From this island, but nobody.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.620
Else knows, so I'm definitely
Looking for the idol, but most.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.103
Importantly, I want to make sure
That rick does not have one.

04:02.137 --> 04:04.241
What's the word?

04:04.275 --> 04:09.896
He's a little liar.

04:09.931 --> 04:14.793
The idol was on this beach.

04:14.827 --> 04:16.654
I know for a fact it wasn't
Rick.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.620
I hope there's one out here.

04:18.654 --> 04:20.379
I need it.

04:20.413 --> 04:21.654
You can tell me.

04:21.689 --> 04:23.034
I don't care.

04:23.068 --> 04:26.827
The vote still went against
Me, so I don't feel like I can.

04:26.862 --> 04:30.482
Trust anybody.

04:30.517 --> 04:34.310
I'm either going to protect me
Or I'm going to go home.

04:34.344 --> 04:35.424
We'll see how it all goes I
Guess.

04:35.448 --> 04:37.000
All right.

04:37.034 --> 04:39.000
I think the rice is almost Done.

04:39.034 --> 04:41.655
I had it all worked out for
Everybody last night.

04:41.689 --> 04:43.758
That was an awesome moment all
Around.

04:43.793 --> 04:44.448
Agreed.

04:44.482 --> 04:46.724
The last two manu standing.

04:46.758 --> 04:48.896
I feel like it's idol or Bust.

04:48.931 --> 04:50.724
I have to find the idol.

04:50.758 --> 04:54.275
If I don't find it, I'm back at
The edge of extinction.

04:54.310 --> 05:02.310
But I'm going to keep hustling
Until the end of this game.

05:04.344 --> 05:12.344
But I'm going to keep hustling
Until the end of this game.

05:17.965 --> 05:22.793
I am working harder than
Everybody else.

05:22.827 --> 05:24.758
Please be an idol.

05:24.793 --> 05:25.896
Please be an idol.

05:25.931 --> 05:27.310
Congratulations.

05:27.344 --> 05:31.413
You found the hidden immunity
Idol.

05:31.448 --> 05:33.517
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

05:33.551 --> 05:34.482
Breaking news.

05:34.517 --> 05:35.206
Another idol found.

05:35.241 --> 05:37.310
And it was me.

05:37.344 --> 05:40.034
I'm so excited.

05:40.068 --> 05:41.862
I've been at the bottom for so
Long.

05:41.896 --> 05:44.551
And that can be so defeating.

05:44.586 --> 05:49.000
But I'm working as hard as I can
To bring the money home for my.

05:49.034 --> 05:49.620
Family.

05:49.655 --> 05:50.896
And I'm getting stronger.

05:50.931 --> 05:55.275
And I absolutely feel strong,
And I know my family's going to.

05:55.310 --> 05:58.137
Be really proud of me.

05:58.172 --> 06:06.000
I am, too.

06:08.689 --> 06:16.689
Come on in, guys!

06:18.620 --> 06:19.448
All right.

06:19.482 --> 06:21.793
Let's get to today's reward
Challenge.

06:21.827 --> 06:24.517
For today's challenge, you're
Going the race out with a ball,

06:24.551 --> 06:28.551
Toss it up and into an overhead
Trap, and then catch it on the.

06:28.586 --> 06:29.655
Other side.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.965
You'll then dig under a beam and
Race to the finish.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.206
Once you have both balls, you'll
Attempt to land them on an.

06:36.241 --> 06:37.862
Overhead perch.

06:37.896 --> 06:39.896
First to finish wins reward.

06:39.931 --> 06:41.448
Want to know what you're playing
For?

06:41.482 --> 06:43.034
Yes.

06:43.068 --> 06:46.344
The win her be taken
By helicopter for a tour of.

06:46.379 --> 06:48.034
These beautiful fijian islands.

06:48.068 --> 06:52.068
A little perspective on where
You've been living for the last

06:52.103 --> 06:53.344
32 days.

06:53.379 --> 06:56.896
You will then touch down at a
Luxury resort poolside, chicken,

06:56.931 --> 07:00.793
Pasta, seafood, open bar,
Chocolate mousse for dessert.

07:00.827 --> 07:01.586
My god.

07:01.620 --> 07:02.689
Worth playing for?

07:02.724 --> 07:03.793
Yes, sir.

07:03.827 --> 07:04.551
Yeah, man.

07:04.586 --> 07:05.517
Let's draw for spots.

07:05.551 --> 07:09.068
We'll get it on.

07:09.103 --> 07:10.034
All right.

07:10.068 --> 07:10.862
Here we go.

07:10.896 --> 07:15.413
For reward, survivors ready?

07:15.448 --> 07:17.965
Go!

07:18.000 --> 07:21.586
First you got to toss that ball
Up into the trap.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.931
Once it starts rolling and gets
Through the only and catch it.

07:24.965 --> 07:25.793
Before it drops.

07:25.827 --> 07:27.275
Gavin is good with his first.

07:27.310 --> 07:28.379
Aurora has her first.

07:28.413 --> 07:32.517
Both heading back for their
Second ball.

07:32.551 --> 07:34.275
That's how you do it.

07:34.310 --> 07:35.862
Brand-new leg on a survivor
Challenge.

07:35.896 --> 07:38.655
This is hard.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.310
Victoria lands one.

07:40.344 --> 07:43.137
Got to get there to the end.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.068
Caught it.

07:44.103 --> 07:46.206
Nice catch by Victoria.

07:46.241 --> 07:47.172
Devens is good.

07:47.206 --> 07:48.965
Lauren in and out.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.103
Here goes aurora for her second.

07:54.137 --> 07:55.586
Aurora, can she catch it?

07:55.620 --> 07:56.896
Yes, she's good.

07:56.931 --> 08:00.724
Here's gaffigan for... gavin for
His second.

08:00.758 --> 08:02.275
Gavin takes a big fall.

08:02.310 --> 08:03.827
Can he save it?

08:03.862 --> 08:04.517
Gavin falls again.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.379
He's going to have to go back.

08:06.413 --> 08:07.827
It's aurora in the early lead.

08:07.862 --> 08:12.379
Now you've got to dig under that
Beam.

08:12.413 --> 08:13.689
Lauren finally lands one.

08:13.724 --> 08:15.896
Got to get to the end.

08:15.931 --> 08:16.793
She's good.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.758
Julie still trying to get some
Momentum.

08:18.793 --> 08:20.034
She's got it.

08:20.068 --> 08:22.310
Can she get through?

08:22.344 --> 08:23.034
No.

08:23.068 --> 08:24.000
Here comes devens.

08:24.034 --> 08:25.517
Devens has his second.

08:25.551 --> 08:30.137
Victoria has her second ball.

08:30.172 --> 08:32.136
Gavin tripping, can he save it?

08:32.172 --> 08:33.275
Gavin has his second.

08:33.309 --> 08:36.931
He's good.

08:36.965 --> 08:39.034
Aurora is first one through.

08:39.068 --> 08:42.413
Gavin, devens, and victoria
Still digging.

08:42.448 --> 08:44.102
There goes aurora.

08:44.136 --> 08:45.482
She can start firing.

08:45.517 --> 08:46.724
Gavin is through.

08:46.758 --> 08:47.965
There goes devens.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.034
Victoria is through.

08:49.068 --> 08:51.379
Julie and lauren still trying to
Get back in it.

08:51.413 --> 08:54.689
My god.

08:54.724 --> 08:57.724
I can't get it in the freakin'
Thing.

08:57.758 --> 09:03.344
You got to land two
Balls on a very narrow perch.

09:03.379 --> 09:04.172
Devens on and off.

09:04.206 --> 09:05.724
Lauren has her second ball.

09:05.758 --> 09:08.931
She's trying to get back in it.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.000
Gavin has his first ball,
Working on that second.

09:12.034 --> 09:14.103
He only needs one more to win
Its.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.103
Aurora trying to get in it.

09:16.137 --> 09:19.068
Devens still working to get in
It.

09:19.103 --> 09:21.620
Victoria has her first ball.

09:21.655 --> 09:24.655
It's gavin on one end, victoria
On the other.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.241
Aurora has her first ball.

09:26.275 --> 09:30.655
We've got three in it now.

09:30.689 --> 09:31.310
Jeff.

09:31.344 --> 09:34.034
Devens, on and off.

09:34.068 --> 09:35.034
Victoria could win it right
There.

09:35.068 --> 09:37.137
No.

09:37.172 --> 09:40.137
Gaffigan... gavin for the win.

09:40.172 --> 09:41.000
Jeff.

09:41.034 --> 09:41.689
And he does.

09:41.724 --> 09:47.896
Gavin wins reward.

09:47.931 --> 09:52.034
Great job, gav.

09:52.068 --> 09:54.172
Gavin, come on over.

09:54.206 --> 09:56.413
Good job, gav.

09:56.448 --> 09:57.931
All right, gavin.

09:57.965 --> 09:58.965
Day 32.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.931
Six people left in the game.

10:00.965 --> 10:02.206
You know what you're doing.

10:02.241 --> 10:04.044
You're going to get a nice
Afternoon, a lot of food.

10:04.068 --> 10:12.034
Now, choose one person to join
You.

10:12.068 --> 10:15.413
I'm basing this decision off
Of who hasn't been on the most.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.241
Rewards and I feel like who has
Been struggling at camp pretty.

10:18.275 --> 10:19.310
Hard here lately.

10:19.344 --> 10:22.000
I got to go with my girl, v.

10:22.034 --> 10:25.862
Victoria.

10:25.896 --> 10:27.862
All right, gavin, you have one
More choice.

10:27.896 --> 10:29.827
You're bringing one more person.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.586
Who is it going to be?

10:32.620 --> 10:35.551
No matter who you pick,
You're going to have three.

10:35.586 --> 10:39.620
People who are sour that they
Weren't one of the ones chosen.

10:39.655 --> 10:41.551
So I've got to go with lauren.

10:41.586 --> 10:43.448
Lauren, come on over.

10:43.482 --> 10:46.344
Wow.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.655
Instant reaction from
Devens an aurora.

10:49.689 --> 10:51.275
Devens, what's going on over
There?

10:51.310 --> 10:52.896
I thought it would be aurora.

10:52.931 --> 10:57.103
She's been the longest without a
Thing, just like vic.

10:57.137 --> 10:59.206
I'm shocked that aurora
Didn't get picked.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.689
It's a game.

11:00.724 --> 11:01.655
I'm just hungry.

11:01.689 --> 11:03.655
She's hungry.

11:03.689 --> 11:07.000
All right, gavin,
Lauren, victoria, nice.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.275
Afternoon.

11:08.310 --> 11:11.724
Once-in-a-lifetime experience on
"Survivor" plus a belly full of.

11:11.758 --> 11:12.655
Food.

11:12.689 --> 11:15.000
Julie, aurora, devens, got
Nothing for you.

11:15.034 --> 11:17.103
Gab your stuff, head back to
Camp.

11:17.137 --> 11:17.689
Enjoy.

11:17.724 --> 11:19.000
Right now I am upset.

11:19.034 --> 11:27.034
I have never really been part of
A big group in this game, and my.

11:27.275 --> 11:28.527
Alliance had a chance for me to
Not be on the bottom.

11:28.551 --> 11:32.413
But now I feel like I'm not good
Enough to be in a group, that.

11:32.448 --> 11:38.482
People don't want me in it, and
It feels horrible.

11:48.655 --> 11:51.827
Day 32!

11:51.862 --> 11:52.275
Fiji.

11:52.310 --> 11:52.965
Look at this.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.655
Look at the water.

11:54.689 --> 11:55.862
It's amazing.

11:55.896 --> 11:56.965
You can't beat this.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.655
My gosh.

11:58.689 --> 12:01.310
Winning this reward is a
Life-changing moment for me,

12:01.344 --> 12:04.000
Because I've only been in a
Plane twice.

12:04.034 --> 12:06.586
I've never been in a helicopter.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.172
We're turned on our side with
The door wide open.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.034
It almost feels like a roller
Coaster.

12:11.068 --> 12:13.137
Heck of a lot different than
Disney world.

12:13.172 --> 12:14.275
Is that our camp?

12:14.310 --> 12:15.275
That's aurora.

12:15.310 --> 12:16.482
Wonderful.

12:16.517 --> 12:19.724
I chose to take victoria and
Lauren instead of aurora.

12:19.758 --> 12:23.655
I'm sure aurora is hurt at my
Decision, but I hope that she's.

12:23.689 --> 12:26.379
A smart enough player to know
She's still better off going.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.793
With me, victoria and lauren
Over working with someone like.

12:29.827 --> 12:32.551
Devens who has a clear shot of
Winning this game.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.724
Look how beautiful.

12:34.758 --> 12:35.448
Perfect.

12:35.482 --> 12:36.586
Congratulations.

12:36.620 --> 12:40.034
Congratulation, guys.

12:40.068 --> 12:41.103
It's the best reward.

12:41.137 --> 12:42.068
Thank you, gavin.

12:42.103 --> 12:42.862
Good.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.344
It's great.

12:44.379 --> 12:45.965
Enjoy it.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.620
Us three have to stick Together.

12:47.655 --> 12:49.034
Devens has to be next.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.413
Absolutely.

12:51.448 --> 12:54.586
We have the keep going.

12:54.620 --> 12:59.517
So if devens wins immunity
Tomorrow, what do we do?

12:59.551 --> 13:01.206
I'd say julie.

13:01.241 --> 13:02.931
Yeah.

13:02.965 --> 13:05.965
You going to talk to aurora to
See where her head is at?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.793
As of right now the three of
Us all agree that devens has to.

13:09.827 --> 13:10.724
Go.

13:10.758 --> 13:12.793
And gavin and victoria are
Thinking julie.

13:12.827 --> 13:14.620
But I'm really worried.

13:14.655 --> 13:19.862
Julie and I have been close kind
Of since right around the.

13:19.896 --> 13:20.620
Reward.

13:20.655 --> 13:22.275
We have been building this
Trust.

13:22.310 --> 13:30.310
So I personally don't want to
Take julie out.

13:32.344 --> 13:39.827
So I personally don't want to
Take julie out.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.206
Hi, guys.

13:41.241 --> 13:43.758
Welcome back.

13:43.793 --> 13:47.206
Coming back from the reward,
I knew I needed to talk to

13:47.241 --> 13:51.000
Aurora to assure her on our end
Nothing has changed.

13:51.034 --> 13:54.448
The most important thing is
Moving together as a foursome.

13:54.482 --> 13:58.172
I'm really sorry.

13:58.206 --> 14:00.758
Aurora is just an emotional
Player.

14:00.793 --> 14:04.206
So now I have to doubly reassure
Her that nothing has changed.

14:04.241 --> 14:07.172
And, you know to, win this game
That it would be smartest for us.

14:07.206 --> 14:09.620
To stick together.

14:09.655 --> 14:11.344
Nothing changed.

14:11.379 --> 14:13.862
We need the four of us to stay
Together.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.241
I ode like devens first.

14:15.275 --> 14:18.413
I know, that but I would like to
Get rid of julie as soon as.

14:18.448 --> 14:20.965
Possible, so I think the final
Four doesn't change at all.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.965
Well, here's the thing, it
Sucks because again I'm not.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.241
Chosen when people are picking
People, and I've been on the.

14:28.275 --> 14:29.137
Outside.

14:29.172 --> 14:32.034
I'm going to trust in the final
Four.

14:32.068 --> 14:33.344
I have to have trust.

14:33.379 --> 14:34.965
But what am I going to do,
Switch?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.275
No.

14:36.310 --> 14:40.551
So automatically victoria wants
To explain there was no ill will.

14:40.586 --> 14:46.758
From their side being on the
Reward.

14:46.793 --> 14:52.000
Even if I have doubts, it is the
Most logical choice to stay in.

14:52.034 --> 14:53.172
This alliance.

14:53.206 --> 14:58.724
I just want to move forward to
Get out devens and julie.

14:58.758 --> 15:06.758
So at this point I have to stick
With my plan.

15:08.827 --> 15:15.103
So at this point I have to stick
With my plan.

15:15.137 --> 15:17.310
Special delivery.

15:17.344 --> 15:18.793
My god.

15:18.827 --> 15:20.551
What is that?

15:20.586 --> 15:21.275
Meeting.

15:21.310 --> 15:23.689
Eric, my gosh, please.

15:23.724 --> 15:27.827
I found thisi Flagpole.

15:27.862 --> 15:31.758
You have been pushed further
Than anticipated, and you have.

15:31.793 --> 15:32.965
Withstood the test.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.241
This is the letter you wrote to
Yourself before the game.

15:37.275 --> 15:40.275
My gosh.

15:40.310 --> 15:43.448
Find a spot and remind
Yourself why you are here.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.482
Try to remember all the good
Things waiting for you now at.

15:56.517 --> 15:57.413
Home.

15:57.448 --> 15:59.724
Don't forget you're one of the
Lucky ones.

15:59.758 --> 16:00.965
What an adventure?

16:01.000 --> 16:07.655
What a story to tell.

16:07.689 --> 16:12.827
I started this journey not
Necessarily knowing exactly what.

16:12.862 --> 16:17.310
My purpose was here beyond the
Game.

16:17.344 --> 16:22.965
There's a part in this that says
This is every experience teaches.

16:23.000 --> 16:23.551
You something.

16:23.586 --> 16:24.827
This too has a purpose.

16:24.862 --> 16:28.241
You have been through a hell of
A lot and never gave up.

16:28.275 --> 16:30.310
You are a fighter.

16:30.344 --> 16:32.068
You have already won.

16:32.103 --> 16:38.034
I would have never realized this
Without this journey.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.275
Be confident.

16:39.310 --> 16:40.206
Be sneaky.

16:40.241 --> 16:42.275
Be the ultimate survivor that
You are.

16:42.310 --> 16:50.310
Get after it.

16:54.241 --> 16:59.482
The entirety of the letter is
About how I want to play a.

16:59.517 --> 17:00.000
Perfect game.

17:00.034 --> 17:01.896
I failed at that.

17:01.931 --> 17:06.619
But having the edge of
Extinction, the introspective,

17:06.655 --> 17:10.448
The personal quest to find out
Who I am, how much I've grown.

17:10.482 --> 17:12.862
And how much I've changed,
That's what I'm taking home.

17:12.896 --> 17:15.068
It's not even worth the $1
Million.

17:15.103 --> 17:19.205
That's priceless.

17:19.241 --> 17:21.862
The only validation you need
Is from within.

17:21.896 --> 17:23.862
You are a unique weirdo.

17:23.896 --> 17:29.344
Do not be afraid to show it.

17:29.379 --> 17:34.241
I'm a 44-year-old child, so
"Survivor" can have maturing.

17:34.275 --> 17:35.517
Effect.

17:35.551 --> 17:38.034
With any lucky use my time out
Here to return to my girlfriend

17:38.068 --> 17:42.034
Leah with a focus on turning our
Relationship into something even.

17:42.068 --> 17:49.758
Bigger.

17:49.793 --> 17:53.482
I hope this brings me a new
Patience.

17:53.517 --> 17:57.931
I hope to be more
Self-sufficient and independent.

17:57.965 --> 18:00.172
I'm in the needy, but I can
Always be better.

18:00.206 --> 18:00.793
Weird.

18:00.827 --> 18:02.034
I can't believe that.

18:02.068 --> 18:07.241
I was so caught up on this you
Were voted out first, you're a.

18:07.275 --> 18:13.310
Loser, but it took me so long to
Finally be proud of myself and.

18:13.344 --> 18:16.793
Realize, wow, I am a survivor.

18:16.827 --> 18:18.137
Wow.

18:18.172 --> 18:20.344
I have learned so much.

18:20.379 --> 18:25.206
I would have never ever in a
Million years guessed it from.

18:25.241 --> 18:27.827
Writing this that everything
Would just come full circle.

18:27.862 --> 18:30.034
I mean, that's pretty cool.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.413
And I'm still here.

18:31.448 --> 18:35.551
I don't give up.

18:50.586 --> 18:58.586
Six days left.

19:07.068 --> 19:09.448
I'm doing what I can do.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.137
My plan right now is I have
My idol.

19:12.172 --> 19:16.448
Now I'm doing everything I am to
Totally mess with everyone else.

19:16.482 --> 19:17.689
That I'm in camp.

19:17.724 --> 19:22.655
With I can rest on day 40, but
Right now it's everything into.

19:22.689 --> 19:25.206
The game.
You following around gives me.

19:25.241 --> 19:28.896
The disconcerting feeling that
You might vote me out tonight.

19:28.931 --> 19:30.137
No.

19:30.172 --> 19:34.034
We're afraid that devens has
Another advantage or another.

19:34.068 --> 19:35.379
Clue or something like that.

19:35.413 --> 19:38.517
So it looks like it's going to
Be another day of idol hunting.

19:38.551 --> 19:46.551
And paranoia, which sucks.

19:50.793 --> 19:54.448
I am having a ton of fun
Wearing these guys out.

19:54.482 --> 19:56.896
I feel like a kid, or like a
Fugitive.

19:56.931 --> 20:03.068
Either one is just as fun.

20:03.103 --> 20:08.965
Hiding behind trees.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.344
I'm not jumpy like that.

20:11.379 --> 20:15.620
I'm laughing all the way,
Because I know I already have.

20:15.655 --> 20:17.827
What they're looking for, what
They're worried I have.

20:17.862 --> 20:21.413
They don't have the endurance or
Drive to keep up, and I know.

20:21.448 --> 20:24.206
It's driving them crazy.

20:24.241 --> 20:25.551
Where is he going?

20:25.586 --> 20:28.827
He's got nothing to lose
Right now.

20:28.862 --> 20:32.586
You think he's just in the
Middle of the woods making.

20:32.620 --> 20:33.413
Something?

20:33.448 --> 20:34.803
Could be if he's given up
Looking.

20:34.827 --> 20:36.965
I think rick has gone crazy.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.310
He disappears out of nowhere.

20:39.344 --> 20:40.689
It's like hide and seek.

20:40.724 --> 20:44.482
So we're just walking around
Aimlessly trying the find him.

20:44.517 --> 20:47.793
I love making them paranoid,
Because it makes them mentally.

20:47.827 --> 20:49.103
And emotionally exhausted.

20:49.137 --> 20:53.103
It brings me joy, which gives me
Energy and it's going to push me.

20:53.137 --> 21:01.000
Through this game.

21:04.896 --> 21:12.896
Come on in, guys.

21:15.172 --> 21:16.034
All right.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.286
Let's get to today's immunity
Challenge.

21:17.310 --> 21:21.275
Gavin, got the take back the
Necklace.

21:21.310 --> 21:21.689
Thank you.

21:21.724 --> 21:24.379
Thank you.

21:24.413 --> 21:27.620
Once again immunity
Is back up for grabs.

21:27.655 --> 21:32.344
For today's chang, you're going
To race to slide letter tiles.

21:32.379 --> 21:34.275
Into target.

21:34.310 --> 21:38.034
You'll then use two handles to
Transport those tiles through a.

21:38.068 --> 21:40.896
Series of obstacles.

21:40.931 --> 21:44.586
Finally, you'll use the letter
Tiles to solve a six-word.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.344
Phrase.

21:46.379 --> 21:51.448
First to finish wins immunity,
Safe from the vote, guaranteed.

21:51.482 --> 21:53.379
To see day 35.

21:53.413 --> 21:56.655
Losers, tribal council where
Somebody will be voted out.

21:56.689 --> 21:59.310
Aurora, during the entire
Explanation, you were shaking.

21:59.344 --> 22:01.172
Your head, moving your body.

22:01.206 --> 22:03.137
What is happening right now?

22:03.172 --> 22:07.206
I hate word puzzles.

22:07.241 --> 22:09.103
Like.

22:09.137 --> 22:12.275
I just want to win so badly, but
When you come in already.

22:12.310 --> 22:13.620
Doubting yourself, it sucks.

22:13.655 --> 22:17.034
Devens, that's
Exactly what you want to hear in.

22:17.068 --> 22:17.931
This game.

22:17.965 --> 22:20.137
Any doubt from any other player,
Beauty.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.655
Absolutely.

22:21.689 --> 22:25.448
If they're all bad at word
Puzzles, I only have to be.

22:25.482 --> 22:25.965
Mediocre.

22:26.000 --> 22:26.724
That's great for me.

22:26.758 --> 22:27.482
All right.

22:27.517 --> 22:29.000
We'll draw for spots.

22:29.034 --> 22:30.000
We'll get started.

22:30.034 --> 22:32.827
Good luck.

22:32.862 --> 22:33.517
All right.

22:33.551 --> 22:35.206
Here we go.

22:35.241 --> 22:38.448
For immunity, survivors ready?

22:38.482 --> 22:41.793
Go!

22:41.827 --> 22:46.034
This first stage is a game you
Play in your backyard, sliding.

22:46.068 --> 22:47.482
Tiles.

22:47.517 --> 22:53.655
When you hear that clang, that's
A good thing.

22:53.689 --> 22:57.551
When they start to clog out, you
Just got to grab them, bring.

22:57.586 --> 22:59.758
Them back, and slide them again.

22:59.793 --> 23:01.379
Devens getting them through.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.000
Aurora doing all right.

23:03.034 --> 23:06.068
Everybody is getting close.

23:06.103 --> 23:08.896
Lauren is first through with all
Of hers.

23:08.931 --> 23:12.448
She can start stacking them.

23:12.482 --> 23:15.689
Devens has all of his.

23:15.724 --> 23:16.655
Aurora is good.

23:16.689 --> 23:22.034
Gavin has all of his.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.793
Here goes lauren now
Transporting a pretty decent.

23:25.827 --> 23:26.620
Amount.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.655
Yo you've got to get over two
Beams.

23:28.689 --> 23:32.931
You can move as many as you
Think you can carry at once.

23:32.965 --> 23:35.448
Lauren finds out the hard way
That was a few too many.

23:35.482 --> 23:35.965
She drops.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Got to go back.

23:37.034 --> 23:38.241
Here comes aurora.

23:38.275 --> 23:39.413
Here comes gavin.

23:39.448 --> 23:40.896
Aurora has a big stack.

23:40.931 --> 23:43.965
Gavin going more conservatively.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.551
There goes aurora.

23:48.586 --> 23:51.517
First beam is good.

23:51.551 --> 23:52.965
Gavin is good with first beam.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.793
Once you complete a phase,
You're good in that phase.

23:59.827 --> 24:00.344
Aurora drops.

24:00.379 --> 24:02.206
She's got to go back.

24:02.241 --> 24:06.275
Devens is good.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.379
Gavin drops.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.379
Devens drops.

24:09.413 --> 24:11.379
Nobody's gotten to the end yet.

24:11.413 --> 24:12.310
Here comes lauren.

24:12.344 --> 24:13.793
A smaller stack this time.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.310
And she's whipping through it.

24:16.344 --> 24:18.413
Lauren is first back with a few
Tiles.

24:18.448 --> 24:19.896
Gavin right behind her.

24:19.931 --> 24:21.344
Here comes aurora.

24:21.379 --> 24:23.310
She's good.

24:23.344 --> 24:25.310
Jeff, I'm playing.

24:25.344 --> 24:29.103
Victoria has her
First pieces back.

24:29.137 --> 24:30.517
Thank you, victoria.

24:30.551 --> 24:31.413
Julie is good.

24:31.448 --> 24:33.344
Devens is good.

24:33.379 --> 24:36.655
Here comes lauren with a bigger
Stack this time.

24:36.689 --> 24:39.103
Gavin once again staying small
And conservative.

24:39.137 --> 24:41.448
Here comes devens with more.

24:41.482 --> 24:42.172
Aurora drops again.

24:42.206 --> 24:45.206
She's got to go back.

24:45.241 --> 24:46.241
Gavin drops.

24:46.275 --> 24:47.482
He's good.

24:47.517 --> 24:49.655
Everybody is picking up the
Pace.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.379
Immunity on the line on day 34.

24:52.413 --> 24:53.517
Lauren is good.

24:53.551 --> 24:55.310
Victoria is good.

24:55.344 --> 24:56.413
Julie is good.

24:56.448 --> 24:59.034
Everybody heading back for more.

24:59.068 --> 25:01.896
Here comes aurora.

25:01.931 --> 25:05.068
She hates anything to do with
Words.

25:05.103 --> 25:06.034
Except speaking.

25:06.068 --> 25:07.310
I like to talk.

25:07.344 --> 25:10.655
No gavin now going to go with a
Couple extra tiles this time.

25:10.689 --> 25:11.586
Lauren back with more tiles.

25:11.620 --> 25:14.068
Julie is getting the hang of
This quickly.

25:14.103 --> 25:19.344
Here comes devens with his last
Letter tiles.

25:19.379 --> 25:19.965
Gavin drops.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Lauren is good.

25:23.034 --> 25:24.379
She goes back for more tiles.

25:24.413 --> 25:27.103
Aurora with a huge stack of
Tiles, trying to make up some.

25:27.137 --> 25:29.724
Time.

25:29.758 --> 25:31.206
Devens has all his tiles.

25:31.241 --> 25:35.206
He can start working.

25:35.241 --> 25:35.862
Six-word phrase.

25:35.896 --> 25:37.379
Aurora has her last tile.

25:37.413 --> 25:39.551
She can start working.

25:39.586 --> 25:42.655
You have been fighting for 34
Days.

25:42.689 --> 25:43.655
Not going to quit now.

25:43.689 --> 25:44.413
She's good.

25:44.448 --> 25:45.700
Lauren has the last of her
Tiles.

25:45.724 --> 25:48.931
It is devens, aurora, and lauren
Right now.

25:48.965 --> 25:53.206
Like every word phrase on
"Survivor," it will be difficult.

25:53.241 --> 25:55.482
And yet seem obvious when it's
Over.

25:55.517 --> 26:00.586
Every second counts in this
Challenge.

26:00.620 --> 26:01.758
Julie drops.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.965
Those are seconds she cannot get
Back.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.586
Here comes victoria with the
Last of her letter tiles.

26:06.620 --> 26:08.793
She can start working.

26:08.827 --> 26:09.413
Gavin is back.

26:09.448 --> 26:11.655
I still have some more.

26:11.689 --> 26:14.931
Gavin still has to go
Back for more tiles.

26:14.965 --> 26:17.448
That's where the conservative
Approach is costing him time.

26:17.482 --> 26:18.206
Now.

26:18.241 --> 26:19.482
Julie is good.

26:19.517 --> 26:25.034
Everybody back working on their
Word puzzle except for gavin.

26:25.068 --> 26:28.517
So many words you could spell
With these letters.

26:28.551 --> 26:35.758
Use your "Survivor" knowledge.

26:35.793 --> 26:42.517
One phrase potentially worth $1
Million if you survive tonight.

26:42.551 --> 26:48.241
Okay.

26:48.275 --> 26:50.034
Devens thinks he has something.

26:50.068 --> 26:52.079
Don't want to say anything,
Because you don't want anybody.

26:52.103 --> 26:54.241
To know, because you could get
This very fast.

26:54.275 --> 26:55.413
Jeff.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.689
Jeff.

26:56.724 --> 26:57.103
Jeff!

26:57.137 --> 26:58.137
En.

26:58.172 --> 27:01.551
Devens thinks he
Might already have it.

27:01.586 --> 27:04.034
Not living on the edge tonight.

27:04.068 --> 27:05.310
Devens wins immunity.

27:05.344 --> 27:07.965
Yeah, baby!

27:08.000 --> 27:09.793
Safe tonight at Tribal council.

27:09.827 --> 27:12.000
Cannot be voted out of this
Game.

27:12.034 --> 27:12.482
Wow.

27:12.517 --> 27:20.068
That was fast.

27:20.103 --> 27:24.137
Devens, come on over.

27:24.172 --> 27:27.172
Safe once again at tribal
Council, and I'm guessing 34.

27:27.206 --> 27:29.620
Days in from the way you've been
Talking at tribal, this is.

27:29.655 --> 27:30.896
Coming in very handy.

27:30.931 --> 27:33.620
I would have been going home
Tonight if I didn't have this.

27:33.655 --> 27:34.413
Really?

27:34.448 --> 27:35.620
Absolutely.

27:35.655 --> 27:40.758
Victoria, gavin,
Aurora, lauren, julie, after 34.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.827
Days, somebody will be voted out
Tonight at tribal.

27:42.862 --> 27:43.482
Grab your stuff.

27:43.517 --> 27:44.034
See you.

27:44.068 --> 27:44.896
There congrats.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.379
It won't be you.

27:47.413 --> 27:49.586
Because I have the necklace,
I'm safe now.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.103
I was target number one.

27:51.137 --> 27:54.241
They're going to go for julie,
Who is the only person not in.

27:54.275 --> 27:57.034
That four, the only person who
Might be willing to work with me.

27:57.068 --> 28:00.103
At all, so I'm really hoping I'm
Going to find a way to keep her.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.137
In the game.

28:19.344 --> 28:20.310
Would you like the talk?

28:20.344 --> 28:21.103
Would you like the talk in
The family room?

28:21.137 --> 28:22.758
I would like the talk to Rick.

28:22.793 --> 28:26.344
I know I'm next on the list.

28:26.379 --> 28:28.793
So I think it only makes sense
That rick and I...

28:28.827 --> 28:32.068
well, you're the only one who
Will talk to me, so I would love.

28:32.103 --> 28:37.413
To talk to you.

28:37.448 --> 28:40.689
Even if he has something,
He's not giving it to her, no.

28:40.724 --> 28:41.655
Way in hell.

28:41.689 --> 28:44.551
Rick winning immunity sucks.

28:44.586 --> 28:51.482
I feel as though he is just that
Thorn in my side which will not.

28:51.517 --> 28:54.517
Go away.

28:54.551 --> 28:56.344
It's all going to be fine.

28:56.379 --> 28:57.275
Julie is going to go home.

28:57.310 --> 28:59.724
I really do trust my final Four.

28:59.758 --> 29:02.448
Because we can't get devens out
Tonight, then the most logical.

29:02.482 --> 29:06.172
Choice for the next vote is
Julie.

29:06.206 --> 29:12.551
He's probably telling her
Right now maybe they'll vote for

29:12.586 --> 29:14.275
Aurora or something like that.

29:14.310 --> 29:15.700
Maybe they'll flip and turn
Against her.

29:15.724 --> 29:18.310
Tonight we're going to vote
For aurora.

29:18.344 --> 29:19.482
Absolutely.

29:19.517 --> 29:22.517
I'm trying to figure out what
They're going to do.

29:22.551 --> 29:25.965
I'm almost hoping that maybe
They'll turn on aurora on their.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Own.

29:27.034 --> 29:29.103
They might think I'm a better
Bet in the finals.

29:29.137 --> 29:30.275
Take the safe way out.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.689
They might take the safe way
Out and turn on her.

29:33.724 --> 29:36.448
I'm willing to work with rick
For the next vote, because I.

29:36.482 --> 29:39.379
Don't really have many other
Choices, but I need more than.

29:39.413 --> 29:40.724
Just the two of us.

29:40.758 --> 29:45.137
Lauren is the only one I kind
Of... if she reaches out to me,

29:45.172 --> 29:50.241
I would have to put my whole
Life in lauren's hands in terms.

29:50.275 --> 29:53.620
Of somehow swaying them I'm a
Better pick to take to the end,

29:53.655 --> 29:54.896
But I don't know.

29:54.931 --> 29:57.931
I do have a good relationship
With lauren, but if lauren votes.

29:57.965 --> 30:01.931
For aurora, we're still going to
Need someone else to vote aurora.

30:01.965 --> 30:06.931
With her.

30:06.965 --> 30:09.758
Rick's probably going for
Aurora, so I feel like I have to.

30:09.793 --> 30:11.068
Put a vote on her.

30:11.103 --> 30:14.758
If anybody else wants to make
That switch, I feel like I'm a.

30:14.793 --> 30:16.344
Much better person for a final
Four.

30:16.379 --> 30:19.586
She has better potential to win
Immunity.

30:19.620 --> 30:22.344
She has a better chance at
Winning a fire-making chance.

30:22.379 --> 30:24.310
I see it.

30:24.344 --> 30:27.172
Moving forward with julie means
That I could possibly sit next.

30:27.206 --> 30:30.448
To her at the end, and I think I
Have a better chance of beating.

30:30.482 --> 30:31.965
Her than I do aurora.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.482
I think that julie has become a
Very emotional player, and so I.

30:36.517 --> 30:39.689
Don't think a lot of the jury
Likes julie.

30:39.724 --> 30:42.448
I do not plan on putting my vote
On you.

30:42.482 --> 30:44.034
I think I can convince gavin.

30:44.068 --> 30:45.862
Okay.

30:45.896 --> 30:49.103
So I'm going to have to try
To convince gavin that his best.

30:49.137 --> 30:53.103
Play is to not take aurora to
The end.

30:53.137 --> 30:59.965
This is the kind of thing where
Letting julie go home looks.

31:00.000 --> 31:00.689
Stupid to me.

31:00.724 --> 31:04.137
I say we vote aurora.

31:04.172 --> 31:06.827
You're my number one, so if you
Don't want to do that...

31:06.862 --> 31:12.896
I'd rather have vick in on it
So she's not likely to flip on.

31:12.931 --> 31:14.068
Us the next vote.

31:14.103 --> 31:18.931
If she shuts it down hard, do
We still want to do it?

31:18.965 --> 31:21.000
We'll get it figured out.

31:21.034 --> 31:24.172
Let me talk to her first and
We'll go from there.

31:24.206 --> 31:26.862
Lauren hit me with a
Conversation, do we really need.

31:26.896 --> 31:30.172
To vote julie, the easy vote, or
Get out someone like aurora, who.

31:30.206 --> 31:33.172
Is going to be a threat at the
Fire-making challenge or just a.

31:33.206 --> 31:35.379
Threat to win that final
Immunity challenge.

31:35.413 --> 31:39.103
I'm still down to vote Aurora.

31:39.137 --> 31:40.206
Okay.

31:40.241 --> 31:42.620
Iauren was ready to roll with
It as long as I was.

31:42.655 --> 31:46.689
She didn't need victoria's vote,
But that concerns me, just.

31:46.724 --> 31:48.379
Because I am close with
Victoria.

31:48.413 --> 31:52.034
Moving forward, I want to make
Sure victoria is in on this vote.

31:52.068 --> 31:54.458
And she's okay with it, because
I don't want to rock the vote.

31:54.482 --> 31:56.413
Were it needs to be rocked.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.931
It's either julie or aurora.

31:58.965 --> 31:59.896
Lauren thinks aurora.

31:59.931 --> 32:01.758
I just think that's the wrong
Thing to do.

32:01.793 --> 32:06.896
I trust lauren, but I'm with
Your 100%, because she was.

32:06.931 --> 32:09.275
Willing to make the move whether
You were on board or not.

32:09.310 --> 32:12.206
I said, new york I'm not doing
It without vick.

32:12.241 --> 32:15.827
Iauren was ready to vote
Aurora with or without me.

32:15.862 --> 32:17.320
Doesn't matter to her if I was
On board.

32:17.344 --> 32:21.620
I do think she does want to
Go to the end with julie because.

32:21.655 --> 32:23.137
She knows that's her best
Chance.

32:23.172 --> 32:26.517
If it's me and you, we can do
What we need to.

32:26.551 --> 32:30.379
Now I feel like I'm in a bad
Spot, because at this point I.

32:30.413 --> 32:33.344
Trust gavin, but I believe
Lauren is trying to work with.

32:33.379 --> 32:40.275
So I just would rather have
Julie out of the game.

32:40.310 --> 32:43.793
I mean, if you and I come
Back here it will be a big.

32:43.827 --> 32:44.448
Celebration.

32:44.482 --> 32:45.527
You're coming back here.

32:45.551 --> 32:47.068
I know, I know, I know.

32:47.103 --> 32:49.551
Julie is the only one who
Will work with me.

32:49.586 --> 32:52.137
I should do anything I can to
Keep her in the game.

32:52.172 --> 32:55.448
She's also someone that I
Wouldn't mind sitting next to in.

32:55.482 --> 32:56.655
A final three.

32:56.689 --> 32:58.941
So I'm going to have at least
One were to tricks up many I.

32:58.965 --> 33:00.896
Sleeve to go along with my
Necklace.

33:00.931 --> 33:04.103
It gives me an opportunity to
Make a splash at tribal council.

33:04.137 --> 33:08.482
And maybe make this four-person
Alliance of aurora, lauren,

33:08.517 --> 33:12.793
Gavin, and victoria turn on each
Other tonight just to have them.

33:12.827 --> 33:17.206
Looking at each other like that
Will further a smile on my face.

33:17.241 --> 33:20.275
The more confused they are, the
Better it is for me, because.

33:20.310 --> 33:23.310
When people are confused and
Paranoid this this game, they do.

33:23.344 --> 33:24.206
Crazy things.

33:24.241 --> 33:27.241
That's exactly what I need them
To do.

33:49.413 --> 33:57.413
We'll now wring in
The members of our jury.

33:59.448 --> 34:04.448
We'll now wring in
The members of our jury.

34:04.482 --> 34:07.103
So devens, you win immunity
Today and the first thing you.

34:07.137 --> 34:10.275
Say is," I was going home
Tonight without it."

34:10.310 --> 34:12.424
What happened when you got back
The camp and you weren't going.

34:12.447 --> 34:13.620
To be the one going home?

34:13.655 --> 34:17.931
There were some unhappy faces
When I got back the camp.

34:17.965 --> 34:20.251
I think only myself and jelly
Were happy I won immunity today.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.344
I think plans got a little
Shuffled.

34:22.379 --> 34:25.137
Julie, is that the
Feeling, that it's you and.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.655
Devens against the world?

34:26.688 --> 34:27.931
Absolutely.

34:27.965 --> 34:31.688
After the last tribal council
Where ron got blindsided, it was.

34:31.724 --> 34:33.965
Very clear there is a
Four-person alliance going on.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.241
Here that devens and I are not a
Part of.

34:37.275 --> 34:40.034
What was the feeling
For you at camp this afternoon.

34:40.068 --> 34:42.000
Knowing devens is safe?

34:42.034 --> 34:44.000
Was it just a shift to you?

34:44.034 --> 34:45.965
I mean, yeah.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.034
Nobody really wanted to talk to
Me today.

34:48.068 --> 34:51.827
So when we got back the camp, I
Immediately asked to speak to.

34:51.862 --> 34:54.516
Devens, because for me, I was
Completely on the outs.

34:54.551 --> 34:57.310
Aurora, is that a
Known fact by everybody?

34:57.344 --> 34:58.551
It's very known.

34:58.586 --> 35:01.586
It's also known that I've been
Very vocal that I want devens.

35:01.620 --> 35:02.379
Out.

35:02.413 --> 35:03.793
I think he's played a great
Game.

35:03.827 --> 35:05.793
Anyone in this game will lose to
Him.

35:05.827 --> 35:08.586
And I will say the same thing
Tomorrow.

35:08.620 --> 35:09.724
I want him out.

35:09.758 --> 35:12.103
Victoria, it's
Interesting that you can get.

35:12.137 --> 35:13.551
Laser focused on one person.

35:13.586 --> 35:14.862
Is there any danger in that?

35:14.896 --> 35:17.344
I don't want to say that
We're in the looking at the game.

35:17.379 --> 35:21.965
As a whole just by focusing on
Devens, but he has played a good.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.206
Game, and his winning has always
Come in clutch.

35:24.241 --> 35:30.379
I think it's a collective goal
That devens should go home.

35:30.413 --> 35:31.527
That's best for everyone's game.

35:31.551 --> 35:35.344
Gavin, are you part
Of the "We" as well.

35:35.379 --> 35:38.103
Are are you all focused on
Devens?

35:38.137 --> 35:40.689
Devens is the center of
Attention, because we keep.

35:40.724 --> 35:42.872
Getting these opportunities to
Get him out and we can't make.

35:42.896 --> 35:44.103
The most out of them.

35:44.137 --> 35:47.000
So it is frustrating in a sense,
But in our defense, he's the.

35:47.034 --> 35:48.310
Master of disguise.

35:48.344 --> 35:51.034
We've been trying to follow him
Around the make sure he's in the.

35:51.068 --> 35:51.965
Finding other idols.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.172
I mean, he's everywhere all
The time.

35:54.206 --> 35:58.000
He's literally hiding in Trees.

35:58.034 --> 36:01.482
I was right behind devens at
One point, and me being the.

36:01.517 --> 36:04.172
Idiot I am, I turned around and
He was gone.

36:04.206 --> 36:05.827
Poof.

36:05.862 --> 36:07.413
I'm like kaiser sosa.

36:07.448 --> 36:09.034
He's a crafty fella.

36:09.068 --> 36:12.793
When they want me the most,
They can't find me, meanwhile, I.

36:12.827 --> 36:14.896
Can find a lot of interesting
Things.

36:14.931 --> 36:16.896
Aurora, what do you
Read into that?

36:16.931 --> 36:20.586
I have learned not to listen
To 90% of the things devens.

36:20.620 --> 36:24.103
Says, but I completely respect
Everything he is doing.

36:24.137 --> 36:28.931
He is out here giving 100%, and
To me that just gives me more.

36:28.965 --> 36:30.379
Energy to keep going after him.

36:30.413 --> 36:33.551
Devens, there's a lot
Of attention on you, and you're.

36:33.586 --> 36:34.862
The one person who is safe.

36:34.896 --> 36:36.793
Thank goodness for that.

36:36.827 --> 36:40.034
But I'm getting frustrated,
Because there are four people.

36:40.068 --> 36:43.137
That have taken control of the
Game.

36:43.172 --> 36:44.344
Really it's three.

36:44.379 --> 36:46.896
Aurora, whether she wants to
Admit it or not, is clearly on.

36:46.931 --> 36:50.275
The outside, but anyway, I feel
Like tonight it's a great.

36:50.310 --> 36:53.413
Opportunity to try to take some
Control.

36:53.448 --> 36:57.206
Because of that, I'm going to
Help out my friend julie.

36:57.241 --> 37:01.241
Tonight, and when the time
Comes, I'm going to play my.

37:01.275 --> 37:03.620
Hidden immunity idol that I did
Find when people weren't.

37:03.655 --> 37:07.448
Following me!

37:07.482 --> 37:13.000
And then julie andry going to
Vote together for vick, gavin,

37:13.034 --> 37:16.103
Aurora, or lauren.

37:16.137 --> 37:17.862
So that's our plan tonight.

37:17.896 --> 37:21.551
Try to take back some control in
This game.

37:21.586 --> 37:24.000
Gavin, big statement.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.594
Devens pulls out something, says
It's an idol and he's going the.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.769
Play it for julie and he's
Targeting one of the four of.

37:28.793 --> 37:29.931
You.

37:29.965 --> 37:31.344
That is a big statement.

37:31.379 --> 37:32.620
I believe him.

37:32.655 --> 37:35.517
He's proved he's loyal to the
People that back him up, and...

37:35.551 --> 37:36.206
Nervous?

37:36.241 --> 37:37.965
How can you not be nervous?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.655
I'm definitely nervous.

37:39.689 --> 37:41.965
Lauren, this is Do-or-die time.

37:42.000 --> 37:42.827
Look around.

37:42.862 --> 37:44.517
There are only handful of people
Left.

37:44.551 --> 37:47.172
Yeah, it's just like the fear
Factor of it.

37:47.206 --> 37:48.310
He tells you one thing.

37:48.344 --> 37:49.172
He does another thing.

37:49.206 --> 37:50.758
And if I was him, why not?

37:50.793 --> 37:53.551
You get julie on your side and
You take someone out that you.

37:53.586 --> 37:55.862
Don't want to sit by at the end.

37:55.896 --> 37:59.482
And so I don't feel as
Comfortable as I did walking in.

37:59.517 --> 38:00.413
It's still also an if.

38:00.448 --> 38:03.655
If it's an actual idol.

38:03.689 --> 38:06.448
It's in a red piece of paper
Which is the same color he.

38:06.482 --> 38:07.689
Pulled out for the last one.

38:07.724 --> 38:10.586
In this tribal is over, I'm not
Taking anything for granted.

38:10.620 --> 38:13.689
Gavin, it is
Interesting that fake idols can.

38:13.724 --> 38:16.655
Be powerful, because you never
Know until it comes time to read.

38:16.689 --> 38:17.931
The votes.

38:17.965 --> 38:21.379
Yeah, I think you take that
Into consideration and truly how.

38:21.413 --> 38:23.413
Close are devens and julie?

38:23.448 --> 38:26.620
Does devens need this idol for
Himself at the next vote?

38:26.655 --> 38:30.172
Because that would still leave a
Four against one.

38:30.206 --> 38:33.034
I might say with the
Chance of something coming back.

38:33.068 --> 38:35.448
From distinction it would be
3-3.

38:35.482 --> 38:37.172
That could be a big move in this
Game.

38:37.206 --> 38:39.793
And if they want to bet a
Million dollars that I'm not.

38:39.827 --> 38:43.034
Going to play this on julie even
Though I already played one on

38:43.068 --> 38:47.068
David, then that's fine, but
It's a million dollar gamble.

38:47.103 --> 38:50.655
Devens, this bravado
That you're showing tonight, do.

38:50.689 --> 38:54.275
You think that was at all
Influenced by being voted out,

38:54.310 --> 38:57.103
Sent to distinction, having to
Fight your way back in, is there.

38:57.137 --> 38:59.758
Anything about this second
Chance that has changed you?

38:59.793 --> 39:01.103
Absolutely.

39:01.137 --> 39:06.172
I went out is so easily.

39:06.206 --> 39:07.482
I wanted to be a nice guy.

39:07.517 --> 39:09.000
You have time to think about it.

39:09.034 --> 39:10.310
Why didn't I fight harder?

39:10.344 --> 39:13.068
This time I'm playing with house
Money, and there is some freedom.

39:13.103 --> 39:15.655
Being on the bottom and having
Nobody work with you.

39:15.689 --> 39:18.862
So now I'm just doing everything
I can to better my position in.

39:18.896 --> 39:20.172
The game.

39:20.206 --> 39:24.793
And you need allies in this
Game.

39:24.827 --> 39:25.310
All right.

39:25.344 --> 39:27.275
It is time to vote.

39:27.310 --> 39:32.068
Lauren, you're up.

39:43.034 --> 39:48.999
You're a cool girl who
Refuses to work with me.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.034
You're a cool girl who
Refuses to work with me.

40:09.482 --> 40:17.482
I'll go tally the Votes.

40:23.517 --> 40:27.413
If anybody has a hidden immunity
Idol and you want the play it,

40:27.448 --> 40:35.448
Now would be the time to do so.

40:41.068 --> 40:41.724
Okay.

40:41.758 --> 40:49.275
I'll read the votes.

40:49.310 --> 40:53.724
First vote aurora.

40:53.758 --> 40:54.206
Julie.

40:54.241 --> 40:58.344
One vote julie.

40:58.379 --> 40:58.931
Aurora.

40:58.965 --> 41:05.793
That's two votes aurora.

41:05.827 --> 41:06.724
Aurora.

41:06.758 --> 41:12.379
That's three votes aurora, one
Vote julie.

41:12.413 --> 41:15.103
14th person voted out and
11th member of our jury,

41:15.137 --> 41:15.793
Aurora.

41:15.827 --> 41:16.379
That's four.

41:16.413 --> 41:17.413
That's enough.

41:17.448 --> 41:25.448
How do you fall for this
Reverse psychology?

41:29.620 --> 41:34.034
Aurora, the tribe has spoken.

41:34.068 --> 41:35.068
Good game, guys.

41:35.103 --> 41:35.724
Good luck.

41:35.758 --> 41:37.241
Get him out.

41:37.275 --> 41:39.586
Still?

41:39.620 --> 41:47.206
Still?

41:47.241 --> 41:50.241
Dang.

42:06.551 --> 42:08.551
Stay tuned for scenes
From our next episode.

42:13.965 --> 42:17.482
Next time on the
Season finale of "Survivor,".

42:17.517 --> 42:21.827
Five are left, and one will
Return from the edge of.

42:21.862 --> 42:22.862
Extinction.

42:22.896 --> 42:27.310
You each have one goal... defeat
Everybody else.

42:27.344 --> 42:30.620
Who will outlast all the rest
And claim the title of sole.

42:30.655 --> 42:31.482
"Survivor"?

42:31.517 --> 42:33.586
Join us for the finale next
Wednesday.

42:33.620 --> 42:37.965
It was so predictable, which
I can't understand how anyone.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Fell for that.

42:39.034 --> 42:43.310
My plan is to get pumped up for
The competition.

42:43.344 --> 42:45.700
It's either going to get me back
In the game or it's going to be.

42:45.724 --> 42:47.551
My final "Survivor" challenge.

42:47.586 --> 42:48.551
Welcome to the edge.

42:48.586 --> 42:50.344
Miss positivity over here.

42:50.379 --> 42:53.379
It's been a long 30 whatever
Days.
