00:14.914 --> 00:18.184
I don't have the time to deal with retail.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.994
<i>-What's going through your mind?</i>
-I don't know, I just…

01:02.762 --> 01:06.066
I just want my family happy.

01:21.948 --> 01:26.653
They don't… won't help me.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.245
Nothing's gonna change.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.452
-So did I.
-I was like the last one working

08:35.114 --> 08:37.350
Are you excited to work at <i>Seventeen?</i>

08:56.903 --> 09:00.106
June 6th is the official last day. Yeah.

09:57.229 --> 09:58.898
My dress just ripped.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.170
Karma!

10:04.704 --> 10:08.541
I don't know what to do unless we
safety pin it or sew me in it.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.205
Here, look up a little bit.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.541
If you want me to finish it,
you got to look up.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.546
Morning. Where is <i>mi madre?</i>

25:31.062 --> 25:32.330
Do you ever?

25:44.876 --> 25:46.978
You couldn't have thrown
something on for this?

25:48.313 --> 25:49.614
You just don't care.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.952
I mean, you still got to take it serious.

26:25.984 --> 26:28.219
-Casual, all right?
-No, I'm not feeling too good.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.560
-Oh, really?
-So, we're excited to make sweatpants.

26:35.627 --> 26:37.529
-Sweatpants, right?
-That's it.

29:14.519 --> 29:15.687
What?

29:16.788 --> 29:17.956
I don't feel good.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.421
No, Mom, I'm gonna fail.

35:22.019 --> 35:23.921
-How is it? Thank you.
-You look nice.

35:23.988 --> 35:25.623
I told you I clean up nice!

35:26.324 --> 35:28.426
-Do you like it?
-You see how it is over here?

35:28.493 --> 35:32.964
-Yeah, is this where you live, too?
-I live, like, 20 minutes away.

35:45.009 --> 35:46.010
Yeah.

36:05.963 --> 36:07.665
I did not authorize this!

36:16.941 --> 36:18.809
The reason why they all do
mixtapes is because

36:18.876 --> 36:21.779
it's how you keep the streets buzzin'.

36:31.622 --> 36:32.757
I need some fronts, yo.

39:41.612 --> 39:43.447
That's the style now.

41:33.958 --> 41:36.293
<i>You did your face and you were fine.
This is nothing.</i>
