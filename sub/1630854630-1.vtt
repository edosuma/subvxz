02:13.842 --> 02:14.843
Hello.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.638
Hello.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.516
What are you doing here?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.852
I'm lost.

02:24.436 --> 02:29.441
Oh, dear. Well, that's no good.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.321
So, how did you get here?

02:35.197 --> 02:37.699
Well, hello.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.660
Hello, who?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.161
Hello, cake.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.288
What cake?

02:43.372 --> 02:46.625
That cake. It looks delicious.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.754
Spectacular. I mean it's magnificent.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.381
I can't see a cake.

02:52.464 --> 02:53.924
It's…

02:58.846 --> 02:59.847
It's a tree.

03:02.474 --> 03:07.521
It is a lovely tree.
And it did look a bit like a cake.

03:09.940 --> 03:15.737
So-- Yes. Well, no cake. And you're lost.

03:16.905 --> 03:17.906
Yes.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.912
An old mole once told me,

03:24.413 --> 03:30.002
"When you're lost, follow the river,
and it will take you home."

03:30.085 --> 03:31.587
But I can't see a river.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.884
Perhaps you could see one
from that branch.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.804
And if you happen to see a cake
while you're up the--

03:42.055 --> 03:43.599
I'm so sorry.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.727
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.437
Are you okay?

03:48.520 --> 03:49.605
Completely my fault.

03:49.688 --> 03:50.981
I'm really sorry.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.860
Well, no. Thank you.
I was feeling a bit warm actually.

04:12.628 --> 04:13.629
What can you see?

04:15.422 --> 04:16.673
Nothing, really.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.474
What do you want to be when you grow up?

04:30.479 --> 04:31.480
Kind.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.327
Nothing beats kindness.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.915
It sits quietly beyond all things.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.803
So much beauty we need to look after.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.807
Yes. So much.

05:13.564 --> 05:14.565
Are you all right?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.235
Sorry. Yes, totally fine.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.655
No, just thought we should start looking
for that river.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.417
Lemon drizzle. This is quite a hill.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.004
Is this better?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.884
Well, I don't want to be too much trouble.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.844
-It's okay.
-Well, thank you.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.358
What's that over there?

05:59.610 --> 06:00.694
It's the wild.

06:02.946 --> 06:03.947
Don't fear it.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.662
Look. I can see a river.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.332
Wait. What?

06:13.415 --> 06:16.251
I said don't fear it,
not charge straight at it.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.005
I mean, really. Good grief.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.179
Do you have a favorite saying?

06:28.680 --> 06:29.681
Yes.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.850
What is it?

06:33.060 --> 06:37.314
If at first you don't succeed,
have some cake.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.858
I see. Does it work?

06:41.026 --> 06:42.152
Every time.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.700
Did the old mole say
which way we should follow?

06:51.537 --> 06:52.621
I didn't ask her that.

07:05.384 --> 07:10.055
Isn't it odd,
we can only see our outsides,

07:10.931 --> 07:14.017
but nearly everything happens
on the inside?

07:21.024 --> 07:23.360
Is there something there?

07:30.325 --> 07:31.493
It's getting dark.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.370
Shall we…

07:34.955 --> 07:35.956
Good idea.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.792
We can set off properly tomorrow.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.510
What was that?

07:50.345 --> 07:54.099
Imagine how we'd be
if we were less afraid.

07:57.561 --> 08:02.399
Most of the old moles I know wish
they'd listened less to their fears

08:02.482 --> 08:04.318
and more to their dreams.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.156
What do you dream about?

08:10.741 --> 08:12.117
Home.

08:13.785 --> 08:14.786
What's that like?

08:15.787 --> 08:20.125
I don't know. I'm… not sure.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.422
But I know I need one.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.334
Oh, golly. He looks hungry.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.002
He does.

09:33.824 --> 09:37.452
It's okay. The fox is gone.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.790
What was that?

09:41.874 --> 09:42.875
I'm not sure.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.545
Do you think someone's hurt?

09:47.337 --> 09:48.338
Maybe.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.465
Should we go and check?

09:51.008 --> 09:55.637
Good idea. I'll stay in here
to keep you warm.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.390
Okay. Thank you.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.736
It's the fox.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.699
He's trapped.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.125
Oh, dear.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.044
Please, be careful.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.173
I am not afraid.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.098
If I wasn't caught in this snare,

10:41.225 --> 10:43.227
I'd kill you.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.064
If you stay in that snare,

10:48.482 --> 10:50.609
you'll die.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.465
You did so well.

11:16.802 --> 11:23.725
One of our greatest freedoms
is how we react to things.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.033
Lovely morning.

11:40.868 --> 11:41.869
Shall we get go--

11:42.369 --> 11:45.247
Whoops. You're rolling.

11:45.747 --> 11:49.293
You look like a snowball. No, a mole ball.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.421
A snow mole. Stop rolling.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.839
Goodness me.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.929
Oh, gosh, no. The river. Look out!

12:27.623 --> 12:28.707
Take my hand.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.002
Oh, no. The fox.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.682
No!

12:50.312 --> 12:51.313
No.

13:14.837 --> 13:15.838
Thank you.

13:25.556 --> 13:26.557
Thank you.

13:44.950 --> 13:48.328
The fox is back.
Do you think he's coming with us?

13:49.746 --> 13:50.789
I do hope so.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.333
Maybe he's lost too.

13:54.084 --> 13:58.630
Well, I think everyone feels
a bit lost sometimes. I know I do.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.678
I know what a home looks like.

14:05.179 --> 14:06.972
-Do you?
-Yes.

14:07.055 --> 14:12.895
It has walls, a roof, a bell
above the door and cakes in every window.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.397
I think that's a cake shop.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.483
Is that not a type of home?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.111
You can't live in a cake shop.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.113
Well, why ever not?

14:28.160 --> 14:32.372
I think home is somewhere warm

14:33.248 --> 14:36.210
and kind, with lights.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.059
Hello.

14:56.980 --> 14:57.981
Hello.

15:01.735 --> 15:02.736
Hello.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.447
Have you been here a while?

15:06.782 --> 15:07.908
It feels that way.

15:09.660 --> 15:10.661
Are you lost?

15:11.537 --> 15:12.871
No.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.583
We are, but we have a plan.

15:50.993 --> 15:54.913
The snow on the trees,
it really does look just like icing.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.749
You're obsessed.

16:35.662 --> 16:40.250
Doing nothing with friends
is never doing nothing, is it?

16:41.043 --> 16:42.211
No.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.836
Look at that.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.424
I am so small.

17:30.634 --> 17:34.179
Yes, but you make a huge difference.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.392
So, what are we doing?

17:39.268 --> 17:41.270
Well, we're on a quest for cake.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.814
Are you now?

17:43.897 --> 17:48.110
No, not really.
We're following the river to find a home.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.736
How far is it?

17:50.821 --> 17:52.155
We don't know.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.784
Well, let's get going then.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.041
How fast can you run?

18:03.876 --> 18:06.670
Well, I wouldn't say
I was a natural athlete,

18:06.753 --> 18:09.798
but I did once win a digging competition.

18:09.882 --> 18:11.758
I don't mean you.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.928
I see. Well, I-- Golly.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.298
You fell.

18:53.675 --> 18:54.676
But I've got you.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.059
Sorry.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.311
It was an accident.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.565
It's my fault. I let go.

19:12.361 --> 19:15.906
Oh, gosh. Sorry.

19:18.951 --> 19:22.955
No. Tears fall for a reason.

19:23.038 --> 19:26.834
And they're your strength, not weakness.

19:28.669 --> 19:33.298
I think you believe in me more than I do.

19:36.552 --> 19:37.553
You'll catch up.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.641
Life is difficult…

19:45.561 --> 19:46.812
but you are loved.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.655
Look. Lights.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.992
That looks like a home.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.119
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

20:20.554 --> 20:22.472
The fox never really speaks.

20:23.765 --> 20:27.519
No. And it's lovely he's with us.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.857
To be honest…

20:34.318 --> 20:37.112
I often feel

20:37.196 --> 20:42.242
I've got nothing interesting to say.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.583
Being honest is always interesting.

21:05.933 --> 21:09.061
What's the bravest thing you've ever said?

21:12.606 --> 21:13.607
"Help."

21:16.151 --> 21:19.530
Asking for help isn't giving up.

21:20.781 --> 21:23.450
It's refusing to give up.

21:34.419 --> 21:39.007
Sometimes, I want to say,
"I love you, all."

21:39.091 --> 21:41.051
But I find it difficult.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.135
Do you?

21:42.719 --> 21:47.140
Yes, so I say something like,
"I'm glad we're all here."

21:48.851 --> 21:49.852
Okay.

21:50.936 --> 21:52.271
I'm glad we're all here.

21:54.523 --> 21:56.066
We're so glad we're here too.

22:07.786 --> 22:11.081
What should we do? That didn't sound good.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.584
Good grief, I don't like this.

23:28.242 --> 23:30.994
When the big things feel out of control,

23:31.662 --> 23:35.374
focus on what you love
right under your nose.

23:37.501 --> 23:38.502
I like that.

23:43.549 --> 23:46.176
This storm will pass.

24:17.875 --> 24:23.380
Oh, no. Where are the lights?
I can't see them anymore.

24:25.883 --> 24:29.970
It feels like
we have such a long way to go.

24:32.097 --> 24:36.935
I know. But look how far we've come.

24:38.896 --> 24:42.191
I just don't think I can do this.

24:44.193 --> 24:46.820
I'm never going to find a home.

24:50.282 --> 24:51.283
You know,

24:52.367 --> 24:56.663
sometimes your mind plays tricks on you.

24:59.541 --> 25:03.420
It can tell you you're no good,
that it's all hopeless.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.424
But I've discovered this:

25:09.384 --> 25:12.930
You are loved and important,

25:13.472 --> 25:17.559
and you bring to this world
things that no one else can.

25:19.853 --> 25:20.854
So hold on.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.705
Are you all right?

25:44.336 --> 25:47.339
There's something I haven't told you.

25:48.549 --> 25:49.550
What?

25:52.386 --> 25:54.054
I can fly.

25:54.930 --> 25:56.515
You can fly?

25:57.140 --> 26:02.688
Yes. But I stopped
because it made the other horses jealous.

26:05.065 --> 26:10.279
Well, we love you
whether you can fly or not.

26:37.848 --> 26:39.474
Come and join us.

26:40.642 --> 26:44.396
I think I'll stay here. Thank you.

26:45.063 --> 26:46.064
Please.

27:58.011 --> 28:01.473
Look. There it is.

28:03.058 --> 28:04.059
You found it.

28:33.755 --> 28:37.843
It looks like a home, doesn't it?

28:40.345 --> 28:43.849
Well, here we are then.

28:45.392 --> 28:46.393
Yes.

28:54.902 --> 28:55.903
Thank you.

29:06.496 --> 29:07.497
Goodbye.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.126
Always remember…

29:13.128 --> 29:14.171
you're enough.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.798
Just as you are.

29:25.599 --> 29:28.810
I'm glad we're all here.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.899
I'm so glad you're here too.

29:47.538 --> 29:48.705
Goodbye.

29:51.792 --> 29:53.460
I'm really going to miss you.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.499
No.

30:39.548 --> 30:42.968
Home isn't always a place, is it?

31:12.372 --> 31:15.501
Well, this is warm.

31:18.170 --> 31:19.755
And very kind.

31:21.632 --> 31:23.509
And look at the stars.

31:32.476 --> 31:35.270
So, you know all about me?

31:36.438 --> 31:37.439
Yes.

31:38.315 --> 31:41.109
And you still love me?

31:42.027 --> 31:43.695
We love you all the more.

31:46.990 --> 31:49.826
That's why we're here, isn't it?

31:50.869 --> 31:51.870
For cake?

31:53.872 --> 31:54.873
To love.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.043
And be loved.
