WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:06.740
You had a blast.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.609
I didn't say
it wasn't fun,

00:08.742 --> 00:11.645
but that decade
was a crime against fashion.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.781
Tonight's club
is my pick, my vibe.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.083
Ooh, which is?

00:15.949 --> 00:17.218
Sophisticated ladies.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.952
I can work with that.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.126
Shaun?
Hmm?

00:25.259 --> 00:27.395
Sure you don't feel
left out?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.530
I use the time to study
less invasive

00:29.663 --> 00:30.631
bowel resection
techniques.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.836
Please be home by 11:30.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.571
Hm.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.473
He's got you on
a curfew?

00:39.607 --> 00:42.210
Sex schedule.
Our window
ends at midnight.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.219
It's like I slept
on gravel.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.154
Well, that explains
your snoring.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.356
Your mattress
should be burned.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.365
It's time to end
the sleepovers

01:04.498 --> 01:05.933
and for you to ditch
the bachelor pad.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.237
You asking me
to move into your place?

01:09.370 --> 01:11.105
I'm asking you to move
into a new place...

01:13.441 --> 01:14.508
With me.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.549
No neutral zone
to run to after a fight.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.519
Making up's
the best part.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.088
Well, it can't hurt to look.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.868
This is Trent,
his mother, Carrie.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.103
Signs of severe infection
on his left index finger.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.238
I'm ordering a CT.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.073
Sutures are inconsistent
and crude.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.208
It's a minor upgrade.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.878
I installed a magnet
in my finger.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.718
Were you having trouble
holding forks?

01:57.851 --> 01:58.919
It's body art.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.955
Yeah, he's 17,
immune to common sense.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.825
Art seems like
a poor descriptor

02:04.958 --> 02:06.794
given the ugliness
of the infection.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.629
The more appropriate term
is "biohacking."

02:10.464 --> 02:13.901
I put Neosporin on it and took
ibuprofen for the swelling.

02:14.034 --> 02:14.802
That's worked before.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.770
Before?

02:16.904 --> 02:18.071
Show them.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.586
Hmm.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.503
You wanted to see me?

02:49.637 --> 02:52.072
Dr. Glassman,
this is Kayla Quinn.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.008
She's been diagnosed
with major depressive
disorder

02:55.142 --> 02:56.344
as well as chronic
neuropathic pain

02:56.477 --> 02:58.646
from a neck injury
six years ago.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.014
The pain and depression
are besties,

03:01.148 --> 03:03.150
uninvited guests
that travel together,

03:03.284 --> 03:05.819
make it so I can't work,
can't get out of bed,

03:05.953 --> 03:07.187
can't even think.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.658
That's why I'd like to do this
before their next visit.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.463
An anterior cingulotomy
seems like the...

03:17.130 --> 03:18.399
Excuse me.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.172
She is a smart,
charming, successful
woman whose life...

03:25.306 --> 03:26.540
Nice ambush.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.509
She's had over a decade
of therapy,

03:28.642 --> 03:30.378
five classes
of anti-depressants,

03:30.511 --> 03:31.545
and non-invasive
neuro-modulation,

03:31.679 --> 03:34.582
including C.E.S.
and full-on E.C.T.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.550
She's desperate
for real relief

03:36.684 --> 03:37.751
from her pain
and depression,

03:37.885 --> 03:39.653
and she's well aware
of the risks.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.393
Get me a complete medical
and psychological history

03:45.526 --> 03:47.194
and a couple of residents.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.662
We're just gonna
talk about it.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.569
Not sure who's
struggling more,

03:55.703 --> 03:58.238
the overwhelmed,
super-critical mom

03:58.372 --> 04:00.441
or the sad,
self-harming teen.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.643
Trent called it
an upgrade.

04:02.776 --> 04:06.480
He's not trying to self-harm,
he is trying to self-improve.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.048
Well, whatever
the terminology,

04:08.181 --> 04:10.584
he cut into his finger
with an X-ACTO knife.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.253
Okay. His technique
was primitive,

04:13.387 --> 04:15.889
but considering
he lacks formal training

04:16.023 --> 04:18.792
and used only one hand,
I am impressed.

04:18.926 --> 04:19.693
Don't be.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.732
Bony marginal erosion.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.400
If the infection spreads,
he could lose that finger.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.770
For starters.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.611
It's the modern equivalent
of a lobotomy.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.313
"Modern" being
the operative word.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.915
We'd be burning lesions
into a key brain center.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.651
That could alter
her personality,

04:43.784 --> 04:44.918
impair
cognitive function...

04:45.052 --> 04:46.420
Her depression
and reoccurring
acute pain

04:46.554 --> 04:47.621
are already doing that.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.658
Cingulotomies are effective
in 67% of patients

04:50.791 --> 04:51.892
with Kayla's symptoms.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.961
With a 20% chance
of adverse effects,

04:54.094 --> 04:56.364
like loss of creativity,
it could be a big deal.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.431
This is Kayla Quinn.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.470
She launched
her own company
at the age of 18,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.805
made millions designing
scrunchies and bangles.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.474
I discussed this
with her.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.241
Her focus
is quality of life.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.910
Now, I'm sure
she feels that way now,

05:10.043 --> 05:11.445
but once it's done,
it can't be undone.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.949
Are there any alternatives
that Kayla hasn't tried

05:16.083 --> 05:17.418
or should try again?

05:21.555 --> 05:22.590
Okay.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.292
Let's do the surgery.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.500
Wait, possible amputation?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.101
The infection

05:34.234 --> 05:36.136
is in the bone
beneath the magnet.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.772
It would have been better to
have brought him in sooner.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.610
I'm a single mom.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.646
Trent... Trent's father
isn't in the picture.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.780
You made sure of that.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.050
I got divorced last year.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.886
Trent and I
were adjusting.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.589
But then he started
hanging out with
these idiot biohackers.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.857
Thanks, Mom.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.161
We should remove
the infected implant

06:01.294 --> 06:03.597
and start Trent
on IV antibiotics.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.799
What about
the other implants?

06:05.933 --> 06:07.000
Shouldn't you
take them all out?

06:07.134 --> 06:09.803
No! The other implants
aren't infected.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.805
Okay. This is not a decision
you get to make.

06:14.174 --> 06:17.511
Once a patient is 16,
it is hospital policy

06:17.645 --> 06:19.212
not to perform a surgery
that's been refused

06:19.346 --> 06:22.115
unless that surgery is
medically necessary.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.385
Leaving in
the other implants

06:25.519 --> 06:28.522
means Trent's still
at risk for sepsis
and septic emboli.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.426
Dr. Wolke is correct.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.828
With your consent,
we can physically compel

06:34.962 --> 06:37.998
the surgical removal of
all your son's modifications.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.366
Good luck.
I'm outta here.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.668
Trent.

06:43.070 --> 06:43.837
Trent!

06:49.009 --> 06:50.478
This is much easier
than chasing him.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.848
Head frame is secure.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.416
Stand by with
the Gamma knife.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.525
<i>Dr. Glassman,</i>
<i>please stop what you're doing.</i>

07:06.259 --> 07:09.663
<i>This is Justin Quinn,</i>
<i>Kayla's conservator.</i>

07:09.797 --> 07:13.000
I have full authority
over my sister's
medical treatment,

07:13.133 --> 07:14.635
<i>and I won't allow</i>
<i>this surgery.</i>

07:27.114 --> 07:28.849
Kayla sees
her psychiatrist weekly,

07:28.982 --> 07:30.450
and I check in
with her daily,

07:30.584 --> 07:32.285
but clearly,
this is not

07:32.419 --> 07:34.488
a weekend getaway
at a cabin in Tahoe.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.190
A chance e-mail from
our insurance tipped me off.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.227
She's never lied
to me like this.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.162
<i>I was 12</i>
<i>when my parents died.</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:43.931
My memories of them
don't seem real,

07:45.198 --> 07:47.100
just clips
from a movie.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.103
<i>It was</i>
<i>our grief therapist who first</i>
<i>diagnosed her depression.</i>

07:50.237 --> 07:52.906
I was 22
and so out of my depth.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.743
<i>Justin and I</i>
<i>used to do</i>
<i>everything together.</i>

07:55.876 --> 07:56.910
It was us
against the world.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.648
I called him Bro-dad.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.316
She was
such a creative kid,
so talented.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.520
She just had a vision
and wanted to run with it.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.455
Who knew scrunchies
and glitter bangles
could be a business?

08:08.589 --> 08:10.057
Just took off.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.793
Eighteen years old,
all that money
and no guardrails.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.496
She was out of control.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.466
Clubs every night,
the booze, the drugs...

08:21.602 --> 08:25.305
I couldn't help her.
I couldn't stop her.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.941
It was during a blackout that
I fell and injured my neck.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.945
Everything just got
worse after that.

08:32.079 --> 08:35.616
The arrests piled up,
underage drinking,
possession, DUI.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.485
I thought she was
going to prison.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.320
The judge agreed to
a diversion program...

08:40.453 --> 08:41.922
She's nearly O.D.'d twice.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.156
...called me
a danger to myself.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.892
The judge ruled
she was incompetent.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.459
Put my brother in charge
of everything.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.198
He took away my life.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.035
The conservatorship
saved her life.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.177
All I needed
to piss off my parents

09:04.311 --> 09:06.780
were fishnets
and heavy eyeliner.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.916
Of course
you were a goth.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.684
How many times
did you see The Cure?

09:10.818 --> 09:12.552
Four.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.988
Robert Smith was, like,
leader of our tribe.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.258
Every lonely teen
needs a tribe.

09:20.027 --> 09:23.330
I was lonely,
but I was not a rebel.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.166
My rebellion
was just being honest.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.636
My family
preferred the lie.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.171
Meanwhile Trent is
damaging his relationship

09:31.304 --> 09:33.373
with his mom
and his body.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.309
That is not his fault.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.577
She is his mother.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.279
Mothers should
try to understand
their children.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.016
Nice thought,
but teenagers are asses.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.519
Scientifically proven.

09:46.654 --> 09:49.122
Their prefrontal cortex
is underdeveloped,

09:49.256 --> 09:50.658
leading to
excessive risk-taking

09:50.791 --> 09:52.159
and lack of impulse control.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.394
Margins in
the soft tissue look good,

09:54.527 --> 09:56.296
but keep an eye out
for the infection.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.464
Let's close.

10:13.546 --> 10:14.682
Mr. Quinn.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.086
Your sister's suffering.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.588
It's a roller coaster
with her,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.757
good days and bad days.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.660
But your solution is to
fry part of her brain.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.429
She could
lose her creativity,
her personality.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.965
Her pain,
her depression.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.466
Maybe.
Those other doctors
ran me through

10:33.600 --> 10:35.102
the risks
and the numbers.

10:35.235 --> 10:39.306
What if I could show you
how Kayla's issues are
hard-wired in her brain?

10:39.439 --> 10:42.075
An fMRI could demonstrate
how the part of Kayla's brain

10:42.209 --> 10:44.812
that handles emotional
and pain response

10:44.945 --> 10:46.479
is functionally
abnormal.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.282
It'll assure you that
"frying her brain"

10:49.416 --> 10:52.252
means only frying
the part of her brain
that isn't working.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.356
And it'll get you both
off of the roller coaster.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.393
The scan's harmless.

11:08.736 --> 11:09.970
Okay, do it.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.849
I've got it. Oh, see?
I can spin it around.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.350
I need to do
a post-op exam.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.555
Oh. You have modifications.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.290
I'm Dixie.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.760
My right hand got messed up
in a car accident.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.529
I had RFID chips put in so
I could unlock my front door,

11:36.663 --> 11:39.432
store my medical info,
and do some
pretty cool tricks.

11:40.633 --> 11:44.571
Are you attracted
to Dixie?

11:44.704 --> 11:48.008
Are you concerned you'll
be less attractive to her
without your implants?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.143
We're just friends.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.645
I host a monthly
biohacker meet up,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.147
and Trent's
become a regular.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.349
The only people
who get me.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.719
You found your tribe.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.392
Incision sites look good.
Right wrist please.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.897
It was not
until I came to work
here at St. Bonaventure

12:10.030 --> 12:12.499
that I felt like
I was part of a community.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.534
I've read about implants
that can operate prosthetics

12:14.667 --> 12:15.903
and an
occipital lobe electrode

12:16.036 --> 12:18.671
that receives visual images
for sightless people.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.908
Oh, these technologies
are very exciting.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.275
It's so cool, right?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.111
I was thinking I should
be an engineer

12:24.244 --> 12:25.879
and I can design tech
for people like Dixie.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.480
Oh.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.050
How's he recovering,
Dr. Murphy?

12:30.183 --> 12:31.885
Hmm, oh, hello.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.720
The surgeries went well.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.857
Finger looks free of infection
and bacterial cultures
remain negative.

12:36.990 --> 12:40.961
We still need to do an MRI
to assess his joints,
but I'm optimistic.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.763
Great. Then once I'm 18,
I can get all my mods back in

12:43.897 --> 12:45.098
by the pros who did Dixie's.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.468
Meaning the tattoo artist
at the strip mall.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.941
Tattoo parlors require
a public health permit.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.877
Yes, that would be
much safer than
doing it himself.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.217
Rain check for tonight.

13:04.717 --> 13:05.886
Surgery?

13:07.821 --> 13:11.724
A new patient reminded me
I need to spend more time
on my business ideas,

13:11.859 --> 13:13.593
less time on the dance floor.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.528
I see a sparkle in your eyes.
What is the product?

13:19.566 --> 13:23.070
My ingestible sensor
that monitors gut bacteria

13:23.203 --> 13:24.737
as it travels through
the GI tract.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.340
Gross yet cool.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.641
How are you gonna
collect the data?

13:28.775 --> 13:30.610
Ideally,
real-time monitoring.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.980
I'm looking at wireless
open-source programs.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.747
You could
connect the sensor

13:34.882 --> 13:36.216
with a smartphone
via Bluetooth.

13:36.349 --> 13:40.353
That would be amazing.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.655
But that code would be pretty
complicated to write.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.259
Not for...me.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.198
You'd have time for that
on top of your IT work?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.934
Says the second-year
resident looking to disrupt
the med-tech business.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.103
Ah.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.805
I wouldn't be able to pay you,
at least not up front.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.974
We could divvy up
the spoils.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.249
75%, 25% final offer.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.850
Hell yes, partner.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.619
Welcome aboard.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.789
Put this
on your calendar...

14:16.924 --> 14:19.059
May 2025,
yacht shopping.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.627
Okay.
Yes!

14:23.931 --> 14:25.198
Dr. Murphy?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.169
Please stop
encouraging Trent.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.605
Your interest
in his body modifications

14:32.739 --> 14:34.307
comes across
as an endorsement.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.376
Oh, I am interested.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.345
Why would I pretend
that I'm not?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.148
Not so long ago,
we were talking about
amputating fingers.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.750
Someone has to talk
some sense into my son
before he does this again.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.822
I'm happy to have
a chat with him.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.560
He seems to connect
with Dr. Murphy.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.396
If you talk to him,
he might listen.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.101
I...would not be
very good at that.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.545
<i>Kayla,</i>
<i>next I'm gonna ask you</i>
<i>a series of prompts</i>

15:12.679 --> 15:14.547
<i>to help us map</i>
<i>your brain activity.</i>

15:14.681 --> 15:15.548
I'll do my best.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.085
Think of a nice memory.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.686
<i>Something from</i>
<i>a happy time.</i>

15:22.855 --> 15:24.591
You didn't like any
of the apartments
I sent you?

15:25.993 --> 15:28.195
As predicted,
altered limbic activity

15:28.328 --> 15:29.796
in the connections
to the cingulate cortex.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.432
The apartments
are okay.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.334
I'm shocked you're
so easy to please.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.769
You're such a quibbler.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.539
"Hate art deco."
"Low ceilings equal doom."

15:39.672 --> 15:42.075
"Berber carpets
hurt my feet."

15:42.209 --> 15:44.544
Well...

15:44.677 --> 15:46.713
Kayla, now I need you to think
of an unpleasant memory.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.384
Take it as a compliment
that I'm so picky.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.254
Picky's fine,
passive not so much.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.388
Send me some links.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.959
More abnormal connectivity.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.764
We're getting
motion artifacts.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.433
She's moving around.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.800
<i>Kayla, can you try</i>
<i>and hold still?</i>

16:11.371 --> 16:13.306
I'm sorry.
Can we please stop?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.607
Kayla? Where does it hurt?
Mm-hmm?

16:15.708 --> 16:16.609
Everywhere.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.912
It's back.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.261
You never came to bed.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.595
We were supposed to have sex.

16:35.728 --> 16:36.829
Sorry.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.132
Our sensor keeps
running out of power

16:39.266 --> 16:41.468
halfway through
the digestive tract.

16:41.601 --> 16:45.038
It's not on the schedule,
but we could have sex now.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.606
I have to shower.

16:46.739 --> 16:47.674
I shower first.

16:50.410 --> 16:54.647
Okay. I will be flexible
and make you coffee.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.183
Thank you.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.335
Good morning.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.747
How's Kayla?

17:27.880 --> 17:31.584
In pain and on the edge of
a full depressive episode.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.654
I upped her gabapentin
and started a low-dose
ketamine IV.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.389
Smart.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.724
Hmm.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.060
You know we'll have to
get her off the ketamine

17:41.194 --> 17:43.263
before we take another shot
at finishing the fMRI.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.203
Do you not want to
move in with me?

17:50.337 --> 17:52.872
I've been busy.
I have other patients.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.242
Allow me to present
multitasking.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.777
Look at that.
Three-bedroom,
two-bath,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.712
courtyard building
with a pool.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.048
We'd have a guest room for
Kellan, a shared office,

18:02.182 --> 18:05.084
and it's 10 minutes
from the hospital.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.887
Well, looks like
the master bedroom window's
overlooking the courtyard.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.189
I know. Nice.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.657
Not nice. Loud.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.464
Then show me one
you do like.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.600
Oh, hell no.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.202
I'm gonna
update the brother.

18:23.736 --> 18:24.737
You paged me?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.173
Good morning, Shaun.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.540
Lea and I missed
our sex night.

18:27.674 --> 18:28.808
It is not a good morning.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.543
Agreed.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.381
Mine started with
a distraught mother

18:34.514 --> 18:37.884
whose son
you refused to advise
against biohacking?

18:38.017 --> 18:40.887
What he chooses to do
when he is 18 is up to him.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.455
True, but you
could advise him

18:42.589 --> 18:44.924
against the dangers
of further mods.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.494
Trent enjoys
the connections
he has made

18:47.627 --> 18:49.462
in the biohacking
community.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.898
You really think
the emotional benefits
of belonging

18:52.031 --> 18:53.633
outweigh
the physical dangers
for this kid?

18:54.567 --> 18:56.936
Teens do many
dangerous things.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.605
If he injured himself
skateboarding,

18:58.738 --> 19:00.940
should I advise him never
to skateboard again,

19:01.073 --> 19:02.775
which could alienate him from
his skateboarder friends?

19:03.876 --> 19:05.578
Is there a potential
for medical harm?

19:06.213 --> 19:07.480
Yes.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.748
Then remind
your patient of that.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.084
You have no trouble
being honest.

19:15.087 --> 19:18.658
I'll do it, only
because you're my boss.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.660
Case in point.

19:29.035 --> 19:32.205
Justin's refusing to let me
finish Kayla's fMRI.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.773
He thinks her being
in the hospital

19:33.906 --> 19:34.941
is what triggered
this latest episode.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.610
He...
He's totally dug in.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.779
It's a judgment call.
Legally, it's his judgment.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.981
I need you to talk to him,
get him to change his mind.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.183
Because?
You're the surgeon.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.452
If medicine could
persuade him,

19:45.585 --> 19:46.953
we'd be in
surgery right now.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.221
So I should just
give up?

19:48.355 --> 19:49.489
I don't know.
Do you want to?

19:49.622 --> 19:50.957
No!
Okay, then don't.

19:51.090 --> 19:51.991
Go find another tactic.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.193
Okay.

19:56.162 --> 19:59.632
No, no, no.
I do the surgery,
you do the selling.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.637
Okay, fine.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.241
Look at it this way.

20:08.375 --> 20:12.979
The brother has been
cleaning up after his sister
for years, right?

20:13.112 --> 20:16.983
So instead of trying
to change his feelings
about the surgery,

20:17.116 --> 20:19.652
maybe change his feelings
about his sister.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.394
Future modifications
could result in sepsis,

20:27.527 --> 20:30.630
severe arthritis,
pseudo-tumor formation,
nerve damage and paralysis.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.232
Suddenly you're a guy
in a drug commercial...

20:33.366 --> 20:36.736
"Side effects include
insomnia, rash,
dry cough, and death."

20:38.671 --> 20:40.006
Sounds like
my mom got to you.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.574
She tried.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.343
It didn't work,
but then she went
to my boss.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.677
That did work.

20:46.979 --> 20:50.283
I think that it is nice
your mother cares about you.

20:51.684 --> 20:52.685
Mine did not.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.856
Mine used to.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.528
My dad used to
travel a lot for work.

21:01.661 --> 21:05.732
He was always off
pitching to investors,
conferences in Vegas.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.200
And me and my mom
would hang out
all the time.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.703
Every weekend,
she would take me
to the Boardwalk.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.905
Never said no,
no matter how many times

21:13.039 --> 21:14.674
I wanted to
ride the Cyclone.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.543
The Cyclone
made me nauseous.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.112
Now she's just
working all the time.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.714
And whenever
we're together,
she's angry.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.717
Never stops nagging me.

21:26.386 --> 21:30.357
She doesn't
like you biohacking.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.258
I don't think she'd like
anything I do.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.098
Ohh, aah.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.633
Is it your finger?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.134
No, it's my wrist.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.640
Kayla's biggest trigger
isn't being in the hospital,

21:47.774 --> 21:49.642
it's your control
over her life.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.311
I reviewed her
history in detail,

21:52.445 --> 21:54.313
and over
the last five years,

21:54.447 --> 21:56.115
Kayla's major depressive
episodes coincide

21:56.248 --> 21:58.317
with major
life decisions

21:58.451 --> 22:00.753
that you've made
on her behalf...

22:00.887 --> 22:02.955
Changing meds
and moving homes,

22:03.089 --> 22:04.624
making decisions
for the business.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.693
You're saying
this is all my fault.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.697
She's saying that being
in charge of my own life
would be better for me.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.799
Until you get drunk or O.D.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.736
That was years ago.
I'm not that person
anymore.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.104
Because I've been
protecting you.

22:18.237 --> 22:19.572
Because
the conservatorship works.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.776
That argument means
I'll be in this forever.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.613
If I'm doing well,
it proves you right.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.148
If I'm a mess,
proves you right.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.685
I'm tired of this, Justin.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.688
I'm tired
of living the life
that you want me to.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.858
You pick out my doctors,
you search my cabinets,

22:38.991 --> 22:40.560
you test my urine
for drugs.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.161
We can talk about relaxing
some of those things.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.563
No! No.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.498
I'm done negotiating
over my own life,

22:45.632 --> 22:47.834
of having what
you think is best
rammed down my throat.

22:47.967 --> 22:48.968
Kayla...
Think acting
like this is gonna

22:49.101 --> 22:50.503
change my mind
about the surgery?

22:50.637 --> 22:51.538
It shouldn't have to.
It's my life!

22:51.671 --> 22:53.172
It's my messed-up brain!

22:53.305 --> 22:56.175
This place is bad for you.
I need her discharge papers.

22:56.308 --> 22:58.177
Stop telling her what to do!
Stop telling everyone
what to do!

22:58.310 --> 22:59.812
Kayla, please...
Shut up!

22:59.946 --> 23:02.014
I need 10 milligrams
of Haloperidol.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.683
Stop it. Shut up.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.668
The LED light
you've installed
in your right wrist

23:21.801 --> 23:24.336
has irreversibly
damaged the joint.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.673
You will never
regain full function
in your hand.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.009
You'll need
physical therapy

23:30.142 --> 23:33.580
until you can compensate with
your non-dominant hand.

23:33.713 --> 23:36.415
Damn it, Trent.
How many times
did I tell you?

23:36.549 --> 23:37.817
Thousands, okay?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.919
But I'm such an idiot,
and I never listened.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.387
I never said
you were an idiot.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.755
I said to stop
hurting yourself.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.224
Maybe some
family counseling
could help?

23:45.357 --> 23:47.226
No, she's the only one
who needs counseling.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.661
She's the one
who failed as a parent.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.196
Your choices
are not my fault.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.164
But I'm stuck
with yours.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.666
Like how you
tossed Dad out.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.367
He walked out on us.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.077
I didn't want you
to hate him.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.749
I hadn't realized that
the alternative was hating me.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.891
Your father
was a schemer.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.930
He kept flitting from one
big idea to the next,

24:24.063 --> 24:26.999
chasing fantasies instead of
taking care of responsibility.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.901
That's a lie.
You're a liar.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.939
He was a self-absorbed
narcissist

24:33.072 --> 24:34.641
who cared more
about himself than us.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.043
That's not true!
Trent...

24:37.176 --> 24:38.911
Leave me alone!
Get out!

24:40.613 --> 24:42.248
Get out!

24:59.065 --> 25:01.100
Lidocaine to numb you.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.369
I figured you'd want me
to feel every stitch.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.741
I'm used to being
the bad guy.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.342
Bad guys don't
give up their lives

25:10.476 --> 25:12.511
to care for
their little sisters.

25:12.645 --> 25:13.946
Thanks for seeing that.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.217
You feel that?

25:23.422 --> 25:26.759
People idealize
what it's like
being a kid,

25:26.893 --> 25:28.961
but, really,
childhood blows.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.564
Being told what to do,

25:31.698 --> 25:34.634
where to go,
how to behave.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.171
Spoken like someone
who had a terrible childhood.

25:39.305 --> 25:43.342
It wasn't my wheelhouse,
or my parents'.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.916
Kayla's first try
at growing up,
she flamed out.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.751
Doesn't she deserve
a second shot?

25:54.453 --> 25:56.455
Maybe.

25:56.589 --> 25:59.992
Leave it to Kayla to choose
elective brain surgery
for a maiden voyage.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.763
Scares the crap
out of me.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.333
Tell her that.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.944
Jerome's
birthday is coming up.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.511
I need to find him
a great gift.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.013
Please don't distract me.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.816
I am looking for a surgical
solution for Trent's wrist.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.818
That's valiant,
but he's about
to be discharged.

26:25.952 --> 26:28.755
I need a gift that says
"I'm really into you,"

26:28.888 --> 26:31.290
but, mm,
without overdoing it.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.726
We could attempt
a partial wrist fusion.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.962
Not for another year.
Trent's still growing.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.832
Jordan mentioned
you have some super cute
race car pajamas.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.868
I could get
Jerome a pair.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.871
They are classic cars,
and I'd prefer not to discuss
my sleepwear at work.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.974
We could give Trent
a course of Methotrexate
to combat...

26:48.107 --> 26:49.809
He'll adjust
to the bad wrist.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.978
The bigger problem
is that mother and son

26:52.111 --> 26:53.813
act like they
hate each other.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.048
I have no idea how
to fix that.

26:56.182 --> 26:59.618
He's managing
his feelings by turning
himself into a cyborg.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.321
Trent is not
becoming a cyborg...

27:17.203 --> 27:19.105
But maybe he could!

27:27.780 --> 27:30.917
I can fix Trent's wrist.

27:31.050 --> 27:34.353
This experimental surgery
uses a customized implant
to replace his wrist joint.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.654
He will have
full use of his wrist.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.090
Also, he will
be very happy,

27:38.224 --> 27:39.759
because he'll have
a one-of-a-kind
body modification.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.728
E-Experimental?

27:41.861 --> 27:43.429
Would it be covered by
our insurance?

27:43.930 --> 27:45.998
Mm, n-no.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.000
I-It is quite expensive.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.971
Which means I'm getting
a second mortgage
to pay for it.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.674
If Trent keeps getting
other modifications,

27:55.808 --> 27:57.676
could that cause problems
with this device?

28:00.980 --> 28:04.516
Yes, his body could
reject the implant.

28:04.650 --> 28:05.852
Okay, but...
Thank you...

28:05.985 --> 28:09.221
Trent should
be able to follow
the post-op regimen,

28:09.355 --> 28:11.057
including
no further modifications.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.760
Or he'll keep seeing it
as a cool hobby

28:13.893 --> 28:16.428
which allows him
to stick it to his terrible
and controlling mother.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.135
I can fix
your son's wrist...

28:27.173 --> 28:28.607
...with your consent.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.517
No.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.568
Looks like our sensor's
gonna poop out
before it gets pooped out.

28:56.702 --> 28:59.138
Maybe if we take another look
at the component specs.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.707
I have drawn up
a list of house rules
that apply to Dr. Allen

29:01.841 --> 29:03.575
when she is working
at our apartment.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.978
One, no work
on scheduled sex nights.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.246
I can get down
with that.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.048
Two, no brushing teeth
in the kitchen sink.

29:09.648 --> 29:10.582
Agreed.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.184
Three, do not wear perfume.

29:12.318 --> 29:13.920
Four, do not speak
in a loud voice.

29:14.053 --> 29:14.921
Five, please avoid
eye contact.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.722
Shaun...
I'm not finished.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.025
Avoid eye contact?
Mm...

29:20.126 --> 29:21.193
Yes.

29:25.364 --> 29:28.734
Shaun, do you not like
having me at your apartment?

29:28.868 --> 29:33.005
I don't like having
anyone other than Lea
at the apartment.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.741
With Lea, I feel safe.

29:35.875 --> 29:39.778
I am not obligated to
follow the guidelines
around social interactions.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.981
By the time
I'm done with work,

29:42.114 --> 29:44.283
I have had enough
of following guidelines.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.118
Shaunie, I never knew.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.722
We can work
someplace else.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.624
The apartment
is half Lea's.

29:52.758 --> 29:55.394
I am very happy
she has found
a friend and partner.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.597
Dr. Allen...

30:04.170 --> 30:06.072
...you are part
of my tribe.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.241
You are welcome
in our home.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.013
As long as you
follow the rules,
including,

30:14.146 --> 30:17.149
six, I am allowed
to ignore you
when you are there.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.504
Does it ever feel to you like
we go round and round,

30:38.637 --> 30:41.974
but we always find our way
back to this same, sad place?

30:44.010 --> 30:45.945
I remember when we
first got here.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.614
You were 12

30:48.747 --> 30:51.783
on a school field trip
to the Municipal Garden.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.988
And I got there
and watched you
sketch roses.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.289
So confident,

30:58.690 --> 30:59.525
at peace,

31:01.693 --> 31:02.728
innocent.

31:06.832 --> 31:08.968
Then I had to tell you
Mom and Dad were dead.

31:12.138 --> 31:14.306
I swore that I'd do
everything I could

31:14.440 --> 31:16.308
to keep you from being hurt
like that again.

31:19.445 --> 31:20.779
I know you're just
trying to protect me.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.219
I'm protecting me, too.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.328
I've been so scared
that I could lose you.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.542
During the fMRI,
Dr. Reznick asked me
to think of a happy memory.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.680
Silvertop, Nevada.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.215
Yeah.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.551
You and me on that river
in the canoe.

31:59.685 --> 32:00.919
That cabin
was such a dump.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.089
It was.

32:03.222 --> 32:04.690
And we were only there
'cause I screwed up

32:04.823 --> 32:06.425
and forgot to sign you up
for that camp.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.726
Camp Capistrano.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.361
Yeah.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.498
That was the first summer
after Mom and Dad died.

32:12.631 --> 32:13.865
You had an excuse.

32:15.601 --> 32:16.935
That was a good trip.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.405
Best vacation
I ever had.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.077
I want that again.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.046
We can always go back.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.248
Not the trip.

32:30.682 --> 32:31.650
The freedom,

32:33.019 --> 32:35.221
that happiness

32:35.354 --> 32:38.090
without the next bout
of pain and depression
landing over me.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.430
This is my chance.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.434
Please let me take it.

32:59.878 --> 33:01.313
Okay.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.797
I'm dying to take
this next step with you.

33:18.930 --> 33:21.200
Says the guy who's
sandbagging the search.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.601
It's the money.

33:26.038 --> 33:30.442
Between
Kellan's college tuition
and my med school debt,

33:30.576 --> 33:31.810
there's not much left
at the end of the month.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.980
And on top of that

33:35.114 --> 33:36.448
my credit's a mess.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.352
This is just
about money?

33:41.153 --> 33:42.454
Just?

33:43.489 --> 33:45.191
If you can't afford it,
I got you.

33:45.324 --> 33:48.460
I pay my own way.
Always have, always will.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.163
Your financial issues
are no reason to put
our plans on hold.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.633
An easy thing to say
when you've never had
to worry about money,

33:54.766 --> 33:56.468
but some of us have had to
live in the real world.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.640
And if you had
the money and I didn't,

34:01.773 --> 34:03.675
you wouldn't want to
improve both our situations?

34:05.511 --> 34:08.013
This isn't about
the real world.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.115
It's about your pride.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.496
I have your prescriptions
and therapy referrals.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.199
I can do it.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.501
Then do it.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.076
I'm guessing this
is my fault, as well.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.180
Okay.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.849
The way you behave
is very confusing
and frustrating.

34:43.982 --> 34:45.651
It doesn't make sense at all.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.486
You criticize
every choice Trent makes

34:47.619 --> 34:49.388
and never ask
why he's making them.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.856
See?

34:50.989 --> 34:52.424
You deliberately
made choices you knew

34:52.558 --> 34:53.725
your mother
wouldn't approve of,

34:53.859 --> 34:56.027
and then were very angry
when she didn't approve.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.230
Even he thinks you took
your biohacking too far.

34:58.364 --> 34:59.898
She's been mad at me
since Dad left.

35:00.031 --> 35:01.433
Oh, that's not true.
Yes, it is.

35:02.234 --> 35:03.101
You don't like me.

35:04.770 --> 35:05.737
You don't
like my friends.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.038
I don't understand
your friends.

35:07.173 --> 35:08.540
You never tried to.

35:09.708 --> 35:10.909
You're just mad at me
because...

35:12.678 --> 35:14.045
You're stuck with me.

35:22.288 --> 35:25.257
I have been mad,
but not at you,

35:25.391 --> 35:26.725
at your father
for leaving.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.764
Afraid I couldn't take care
of you or support us.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.068
You were so hurt
when your father left.

35:37.203 --> 35:40.038
All I wanted to do
was make you feel better,
but I just...

35:43.008 --> 35:44.042
I was too damaged

35:46.345 --> 35:48.947
and jealous of
your new friends,

35:49.080 --> 35:50.749
when I should've
been grateful.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.586
But I was afraid of
losing you to them.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.589
After all,
you like them.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.493
You're my mom.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.030
I'm not supposed to
like you.

36:10.636 --> 36:11.770
Come here.

36:21.313 --> 36:24.115
Can I do the surgery now?

36:28.854 --> 36:30.789
You are gonna
like this.

36:35.461 --> 36:36.628
Time to prep you
for surgery.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.700
Before I go, um...

36:53.078 --> 36:54.513
I got a little inspired.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.919
I'll hang on to them
for you.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.226
Ready?

37:09.295 --> 37:10.228
Yeah.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.583
Carpal resection
looks good.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.352
What did you say
to change Carrie's mind?

37:35.887 --> 37:37.122
I'm not sure.

37:38.189 --> 37:39.691
I tried to understand them.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.429
Maybe you could do
me and my father next.

37:43.562 --> 37:46.698
Carpal and radial bones
prepped for the upgrade.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.104
I'd say you
get the honors.

37:53.238 --> 37:56.375
Resolving conflict
is a crucial skill
for an attending.

37:56.508 --> 37:57.976
Nicely done.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.720
Placing carpal ball onto
the distal component.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.562
For the next few days,
expect some headaches
and fatigue,

38:16.695 --> 38:18.764
but the post-op symptoms
should quickly pass.

38:20.198 --> 38:22.734
Kayla, how do you feel?

38:24.936 --> 38:26.772
Strange.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.175
Something's missing.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.250
The pain.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.756
And I think I'm still me.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.228
Bro-dad.

38:57.803 --> 38:59.705
We have to
go see a judge.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.777
It's time I was just
your brother.

39:17.322 --> 39:21.860
The arthroplasty
fixed Trent's wrist
like I said it would.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.929
You will need
significant therapy,

39:24.062 --> 39:25.997
but your prognosis
is good.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.866
And you better
take this seriously.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.869
Take your meds,
do your rehab.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.806
Invite that friend of yours,
Dixie, over for dinner.

39:35.273 --> 39:36.508
Really?

39:36.642 --> 39:38.477
Well, she seems
interesting.

39:40.979 --> 39:45.350
These are the schematics
of your wrist implant.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.219
The engineering specifications
are quite interesting.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.958
Thanks, Dr. Murphy.

40:08.507 --> 40:10.108
I'm glad my key
still works.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.412
It was about my pride.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.749
And I used that
as an obstacle,

40:17.883 --> 40:19.150
instead of
being honest with you.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.188
I'm sorry.

40:27.959 --> 40:32.030
It's a big step,
but let's keep talking.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.234
I'm sure I'll get
over myself, in time.

40:37.168 --> 40:38.103
Can you do it
in a month?

40:41.773 --> 40:43.742
Because I found a house
that I love.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.045
Gorgeous.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.379
Mm.

40:48.514 --> 40:50.516
And at that price,
it should be.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.851
I would be very grateful
for a studly roommate

40:52.984 --> 40:54.385
who could cover
the utility bills.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.587
What about rent?

40:57.022 --> 41:00.692
I was thinking services
rendered, like...

41:02.060 --> 41:06.464
Shirtless lawn mowing,
shirtless pool cleaning,

41:06.598 --> 41:08.900
shirtless meal prep.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.103
Well, certain studly men
would argue

41:12.237 --> 41:14.472
if we don't start on
equal footing,

41:14.606 --> 41:15.907
it'll never be
our house.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.412
It'll be our home,
because we'll make it that.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.455
A pool?
What about a hot tub?

41:34.893 --> 41:37.328
Our power issue
is a software issue.

41:37.462 --> 41:40.799
Because your data domain
requirements mandate

41:40.932 --> 41:43.468
a specific chip that
requires way more power
than we can actually...

41:59.885 --> 42:04.022
What if the sensor
had bad manners?

42:04.155 --> 42:05.857
Shuts down when
it needs to rest,

42:05.991 --> 42:07.292
ignores what
doesn't matter.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.561
It works, it rests,
it works, it rests.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.362
We could extrapolate
between the data points.

42:11.496 --> 42:12.964
That could double
the sensor's life.

42:14.499 --> 42:16.234
You're pure
inspiration, Shaun.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.469
I am ignoring you.
