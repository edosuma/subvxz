00:11.287 --> 00:12.460
It's broken.

00:12.495 --> 00:13.254
It's almost time.

00:13.289 --> 00:13.875
It's almost time.

00:13.910 --> 00:14.842
It's broken.

00:14.876 --> 00:15.808
It's broken.

It's broken.

00:16.499 --> 00:17.155
It's broken.

your wolfy powers and see

00:26.578 --> 00:28.545
how long it takes for someone
to find out what you are.

00:28.580 --> 00:30.478
MADDY [DREAMING]: I'm just fed
up with lying all the time.

00:30.513 --> 00:33.447
I can't even tell my
friends who I am.

00:33.481 --> 00:34.586
RHYDIAN [IN MADDY'S DREAM]: It's
got to be cool having a

00:34.620 --> 00:36.415
family you can be
yourself around.

00:36.450 --> 00:38.728
It's not nice to be accused
of lying, you know.

00:38.762 --> 00:41.213
MADDY [DREAMING]: Sometimes I
wonder, is it possible to stay

00:41.248 --> 00:42.387
friends with them?

00:42.421 --> 00:44.216
I mean, how well do they
really know us?

00:46.839 --> 00:48.220
-Thought my picture
ought to show what

00:48.255 --> 00:50.912
family is really about?

00:50.947 --> 00:52.535
What being in the pack
means to me.

01:00.715 --> 01:01.820
-Rhydian!

01:05.686 --> 01:06.790
-What's wrong, Maddy?

01:09.207 --> 01:11.485
Are you ashamed of
your own family?

01:42.723 --> 01:43.862
-It's cartoon Jimi.

01:46.382 --> 01:48.280
What do you think?

01:48.315 --> 01:49.454
-Sorry.

01:52.802 --> 01:57.462
I actually wanted
to say, sorry.

Through these veins

02:41.782 --> 02:43.301
-Hi Bernie.

02:43.335 --> 02:44.371
-Hi.

02:44.405 --> 02:45.682
-When did these pets
go missing?

02:45.717 --> 02:47.512
-Last few days.

02:47.546 --> 02:48.720
Why?

02:48.754 --> 02:49.790
Think it's your beast from
the prowl, dear?

02:49.824 --> 02:50.963
-You know about that?

02:50.998 --> 02:52.517
-Ah, I hear thinks.

02:52.551 --> 02:53.518
-Like what?

02:53.552 --> 02:54.381
-Aw, come on.

02:54.415 --> 02:55.036
It's just kids gossip.

02:55.071 --> 02:56.486
Pay no attention.

02:56.521 --> 02:58.039
Check out the local paper.

02:58.074 --> 03:00.421
Page five's got a story about
farm animals being attacked,

03:00.456 --> 03:02.665
was well as those pets.

03:02.699 --> 03:05.254
Oh, but you read
it, you buy it.

03:11.260 --> 03:12.951
[sneezing]

03:19.509 --> 03:22.857
-My family have officially
left the building.

03:22.892 --> 03:25.791
-Let the sleepover begin.

03:25.826 --> 03:28.242
OK, this is gonna sound really
lame, but can you remember

03:28.277 --> 03:29.070
when we were seven and
we use to make

03:29.105 --> 03:30.762
those friendship bracelets?

03:30.796 --> 03:34.248
Well, I found the case, and I
thought we could make some

03:34.283 --> 03:35.422
bracelets while we talk.

03:39.046 --> 03:40.944
What's going on?

03:40.979 --> 03:44.258
-Don't get mad, but I thought
we might spend the

03:44.293 --> 03:46.812
night on the moors.

03:46.847 --> 03:47.572
-What?

03:47.606 --> 03:48.676
What do you mean?

03:48.711 --> 03:50.506
Why?

03:50.540 --> 03:52.335
-The beast is back, Maddy.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.579
And I think I know where
I can find it.

03:54.613 --> 03:55.925
Sort of find it.

03:55.959 --> 03:59.515
Let's just say, I think I
know where it might be.

03:59.549 --> 04:00.550
-How do you know it's ba--

04:00.585 --> 04:02.414
I mean, if actually is?

04:02.449 --> 04:06.073
-Pets have gone missing, farm
animals have been attacked.

04:06.107 --> 04:07.074
-Since when?

04:07.108 --> 04:08.627
-Since a few days ago.

04:08.662 --> 04:10.871
This is our best chance
to see it, Maddy.

04:10.905 --> 04:13.287
And I've worked out
its movements.

04:13.322 --> 04:16.325
-But if it's alive and attacking
animals, what makes

04:16.358 --> 04:18.396
you think it's safe for us?

04:18.430 --> 04:19.637
Look what happened
last time, Shan.

04:19.673 --> 04:20.983
Have you even thought
about this?

04:21.019 --> 04:22.676
-Yes, I have.

04:22.710 --> 04:24.436
And I thought if we just stuck
together and looked out for

04:24.471 --> 04:27.543
each, you know, that's what
friends are supposed to do.

04:27.577 --> 04:29.614
-I thought you wanted to talk?

04:29.648 --> 04:30.580
-We are talking.

04:30.615 --> 04:31.857
-Look, I'm sorry.

04:31.892 --> 04:34.377
I just wanted a proper
sleep-over, you know.

04:34.412 --> 04:38.761
Bracelets, cheesy nachos,
even cheesier movies.

04:38.795 --> 04:41.384
-It's out there, right now.

04:41.419 --> 04:43.662
-Look, I know how important
this is to you.

04:43.697 --> 04:45.423
-You have no idea.

04:45.457 --> 04:47.735
Everyone thinks I'm
the town weirdo.

04:47.770 --> 04:48.667
-No, they don't.

04:48.702 --> 04:51.981
-Yes, they do.

04:52.015 --> 04:57.089
Look, my parents took me to
see a doctor, and they've

04:57.124 --> 04:58.953
thought about medication.

04:58.988 --> 05:00.990
I've got to see a
psychiatrist.

05:01.024 --> 05:02.129
-What?

05:02.163 --> 05:03.372
Why?

05:03.406 --> 05:05.581
-Because of what I
said about you.

05:05.615 --> 05:08.377
Look, I need to know if there's
something out there.

05:08.411 --> 05:10.448
I need to know that I'm not
going completely crazy.

05:10.482 --> 05:12.691
-Oh, Shannon, you're not,
you're really not.

05:12.726 --> 05:14.417
-Look, don't patronize me.

05:14.452 --> 05:16.557
I told my mum you
were a werewolf.

05:16.592 --> 05:18.870
Now give me one good reason
why that makes me sane.

05:21.459 --> 05:22.598
-Because--

05:29.708 --> 05:32.608
because the beast is
real, and we're

05:32.642 --> 05:36.577
going to find it, tonight.

05:36.612 --> 05:40.857
-Oh, that can't be them
already, can it?

05:40.892 --> 05:42.445
Look, you won't tell
the boys about the

05:42.480 --> 05:45.517
psychiatrist, will you?

05:45.552 --> 05:46.691
-Of course not.

05:53.249 --> 05:53.905
-Hey.

05:53.939 --> 05:54.768
-You're early.

05:54.802 --> 05:55.941
-Nice to see you, too.

05:55.976 --> 05:57.426
I'm cooking, remember?

05:57.460 --> 05:58.496
-Oh, yeah.

05:58.530 --> 06:01.084
-Is anything different
about me?

06:01.119 --> 06:03.017
-No.

06:03.052 --> 06:04.709
-New jacket from Manchester.

06:04.743 --> 06:05.641
Dad brought it down.

06:05.675 --> 06:07.436
Cool, eh?

06:07.470 --> 06:08.989
-Well, it's totally
impractical.

06:09.023 --> 06:10.128
You're gonna have to change.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.578
-Wuh-- why?

06:11.612 --> 06:13.476
-Because you're going
to freeze.

06:13.511 --> 06:15.236
I'll find you something
else to wear.

06:15.271 --> 06:16.134
-OK.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.066
[sneezing]

06:17.100 --> 06:20.069
-What's wrong with Shannon?

06:20.103 --> 06:21.622
-We're going beast
hunting tonight.

06:21.657 --> 06:22.554
-What?

06:22.589 --> 06:23.866
No way!

06:23.900 --> 06:25.039
I'm tired of being out int
the dark and cold.

06:25.074 --> 06:26.972
-Tom, she needs this.

06:27.007 --> 06:28.733
-Yeah, and I need to tune
in front of the TV.

06:28.767 --> 06:29.906
That was the plan, Mads.

06:29.941 --> 06:31.908
-This is more important.

06:31.943 --> 06:32.599
-Why?

06:32.633 --> 06:33.841
What's happened?

06:33.876 --> 06:35.602
-She just really needs
one right now, OK?

06:35.636 --> 06:36.948
She needs to know we're
on her side.

06:36.982 --> 06:38.018
-Fine.

06:38.052 --> 06:40.952
I'm eating before we go.

06:40.986 --> 06:42.850
-How many you cooking for?

06:42.885 --> 06:44.818
-I wasn't too sure
how much to get.

06:44.852 --> 06:47.821
So I got one kilo each.

06:47.855 --> 06:49.788
-Didn't you see that was
just far too much?

06:49.823 --> 06:51.894
-Yeah, but I didn't want to seem
like an idiot in front of

06:51.928 --> 06:56.657
the butcher so I asked for
a meat feast for 12.

06:56.692 --> 06:59.557
-Good deal I'm starving.

06:59.591 --> 07:04.078
-Uh, better take off my
new jacket, then, eh?

07:04.113 --> 07:05.252
-Yeah.

07:09.152 --> 07:11.879
Tom, you know we've been
friends, like, forever.

07:11.914 --> 07:13.467
-Feels like forever, yeah.

07:13.502 --> 07:15.676
-But seriously, we
are true friends.

07:15.711 --> 07:17.022
-Yeah, of course.

07:17.057 --> 07:18.817
And you tell your true friends
everything, right?

07:18.852 --> 07:21.302
Like, even if it is shocking?

07:21.337 --> 07:22.787
Like a secret, something
you don't want

07:22.821 --> 07:25.859
anyone else to know.

07:25.893 --> 07:29.069
-Is this why you've been
so off with me?

07:29.103 --> 07:30.035
-What?

07:30.070 --> 07:32.175
-Cause you know I fancy you.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.073
-What?

07:33.107 --> 07:34.246
-It was just a crush, right?

07:34.281 --> 07:35.489
-Ye--yeah, I know.

07:35.524 --> 07:36.870
-But you didn't say anything.

07:36.904 --> 07:38.319
So I know you knew.

07:38.354 --> 07:39.010
Like, you did know, right?

07:39.044 --> 07:39.528
-No, yeah.

07:39.562 --> 07:40.011
I--

07:40.045 --> 07:40.563
I know.

07:40.598 --> 07:41.668
-Yeah.

07:41.702 --> 07:42.634
Sorry if I embarrassed you.

07:42.669 --> 07:43.048
-No.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.187
Uh--

07:44.222 --> 07:47.881
-Did you have any feelings
about it?

07:47.915 --> 07:49.538
-Feelings?

07:49.572 --> 07:50.677
-Feelings.

07:53.334 --> 07:54.646
-I--

07:54.681 --> 07:55.578
I didn't give it a second
thought, but--

07:55.613 --> 07:57.166
-Oh, All right, fine.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.305
Forget it.

07:58.339 --> 07:59.720
-No, Tom, I--

07:59.755 --> 08:01.826
-No obviously it wasn't
worth thinking about.

08:01.860 --> 08:07.245
[doorbell ringing]

08:07.279 --> 08:10.282
-Tom, I found you a jacket.

08:10.317 --> 08:11.801
You're early, too.

08:11.836 --> 08:12.940
-Is that bad?

08:16.910 --> 08:18.187
What?

08:18.221 --> 08:19.568
-Just checking.

08:19.602 --> 08:20.603
-Boots?

08:20.638 --> 08:21.742
--Boots.

08:31.856 --> 08:33.304
You didn't smell or
sense anything?

08:33.340 --> 08:35.791
-No.

08:35.825 --> 08:36.792
-Me neither.

08:36.826 --> 08:39.001
-So she's wrong.

08:39.034 --> 08:39.967
-Maybe not.

08:40.001 --> 08:41.554
Maybe it's smart.

08:41.590 --> 08:43.177
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]:
Are you two coming?

08:43.212 --> 08:45.766
-Just trying to get
these boots on.

08:45.801 --> 08:48.355
So let's say, it is the
wild wolfblood.

08:48.389 --> 08:50.806
So it lives on the moors,
sometimes comes foraging in

08:50.840 --> 08:53.222
new territory, and can
mask it's own scent.

08:53.256 --> 08:54.879
How does seeing it
help Shannon?

08:54.913 --> 08:56.605
-Her family thinks
she's crazy.

08:56.639 --> 08:58.676
I mean, seriously crazy.

08:58.710 --> 09:00.747
Shannon's starting to wonder
if they're right.

09:00.781 --> 09:02.300
She needs to know it's real.

09:02.334 --> 09:05.061
And we're going to help her,
even it means one us

09:05.096 --> 09:06.753
transforming to do it.

09:06.787 --> 09:07.857
-What?

09:07.892 --> 09:09.376
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]:
Maddy, Rhydian!

09:09.410 --> 09:10.515
-Coming.

09:14.243 --> 09:17.004
[sneezing]

09:17.039 --> 09:20.352
-OK, this is us.

09:20.387 --> 09:24.184
And according to newspapers,
the Parkers lost two sheep

09:24.218 --> 09:25.703
three days ago.

09:25.737 --> 09:28.429
Howdale, lost a ram
just last week.

09:28.464 --> 09:31.985
And we've got Highfield, and
Barfield that both lost

09:32.019 --> 09:34.021
animals last night.

09:34.056 --> 09:39.406
And then we have Wilson,
[inaudible], and Hermione.

09:39.440 --> 09:46.378
So, if we just join the dots
together, we get--

09:46.413 --> 09:48.415
-It's circling the village.

09:48.449 --> 09:49.899
-Exactly.

09:49.934 --> 09:51.660
And it's clearly not feeding
in the same place twice.

09:51.694 --> 09:54.283
So we need to be somewhere
around here.

09:54.317 --> 09:55.871
[sneezing]

09:55.905 --> 09:57.113
-I don't think Maddy ought to be
going out with a cold like

09:57.148 --> 09:57.942
this.

09:57.976 --> 09:58.770
-I'll be fine, Rhydian.

09:58.805 --> 10:00.772
-Do you [inaudible]?

10:00.807 --> 10:01.773
-It doesn't matter.

10:01.808 --> 10:02.878
-It does matter.

10:02.912 --> 10:03.879
-Maybe the boys are right.

10:03.913 --> 10:05.121
-They're not right.

10:05.156 --> 10:08.090
I'm coming with you.

10:08.124 --> 10:09.470
-I'll go have a word with her.

10:09.505 --> 10:10.782
-She's clearly made
her mind up.

10:10.817 --> 10:11.921
Tell her I'm sorry.

10:16.926 --> 10:18.238
-Shan.

10:18.272 --> 10:20.758
-I'm looking for a cold cure.

10:20.792 --> 10:22.691
-Has Maddy spoken
to you about me?

10:22.725 --> 10:23.830
-No.

10:23.864 --> 10:26.418
-Not about when I fancied
her, or--

10:26.453 --> 10:27.178
-No.

10:27.212 --> 10:28.351
-Nothing?

10:28.386 --> 10:29.939
-Why?

10:29.974 --> 10:32.424
-I just thought maybe if you
suddenly found out your best

10:32.459 --> 10:34.461
friend fancied you, you'd
think about it.

10:34.495 --> 10:37.015
Maybe even talk about it to
your other best friend.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.258
-Yeah.

10:38.292 --> 10:39.984
But she is going through
a phase, isn't she?

10:40.018 --> 10:41.986
-Like you, like me.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.435
Sometimes it's just best
not to talk about it.

10:43.470 --> 10:44.989
-I see.

10:45.023 --> 10:46.784
So my face isn't worth thinking
about, yet yours has

10:46.818 --> 10:47.888
us running into the
woods every single

10:47.923 --> 10:49.476
time you shout beast.

10:49.510 --> 10:51.374
-If that's how you
feel, don't come.

10:51.409 --> 10:53.169
-Well, maybe I won't.

10:53.204 --> 10:54.205
-Ah, good.

10:54.239 --> 10:55.724
-Good?

10:55.758 --> 10:57.829
Does nobody pay attention
to what I've got to say?

10:57.864 --> 10:58.519
Shannon.

10:58.554 --> 10:59.693
-What?

10:59.728 --> 11:03.110
-Beginning to feel
about my jacket.

11:03.145 --> 11:04.249
-And what if is it out there?

11:04.284 --> 11:05.181
What if it attacks us again?

11:05.216 --> 11:06.389
-We defend ourselves.

11:06.424 --> 11:07.459
-What?

11:07.494 --> 11:08.806
As wolves, in front
of our friends?

11:08.840 --> 11:10.739
-Well, maybe it's time
they find out.

11:10.773 --> 11:11.981
I'm having stress dreams.

11:12.016 --> 11:13.189
-Now who's the crazy one?

11:13.224 --> 11:15.088
-I can't keep lying
to them, Rhydian.

11:15.122 --> 11:16.503
Look what it's done
to Shannon.

11:16.537 --> 11:18.436
-You'll feel it ten times worse
when they broadcasting

11:18.470 --> 11:19.506
the news to rest of the world.

11:19.540 --> 11:20.472
-They wouldn't do that.

11:20.507 --> 11:21.853
-Well, how do you know that?

11:21.888 --> 11:22.889
What if they can't handle it?

11:22.923 --> 11:23.924
What if you fall
out with them?

11:23.959 --> 11:24.925
-I'll take that risk.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.444
-This isn't about you.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.998
It's about all of us, me, your
mum and dad, all wolfbloods.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.448
-And my friends will
understand that.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.415
-But you need friendship
as an excuse.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.900
This is about you
feeling guilty.

11:33.934 --> 11:35.833
-It's about me living
truthfully for once.

11:35.867 --> 11:37.282
-You can't for a reason.

11:37.317 --> 11:38.525
Why is there wolfbloods who have
kept themselves hidden

11:38.559 --> 11:39.491
for so many years?

11:39.526 --> 11:40.976
Even the wild one's.

11:41.010 --> 11:43.323
It's because human beings
wipe most of us out.

11:43.357 --> 11:47.016
Or is your dad lying
about all that?

11:47.051 --> 11:49.053
-Am I interrupting something?

11:49.087 --> 11:51.400
-No, of course not.

11:51.434 --> 11:53.505
-All right. well, this is the
only cold remedy I could find.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.852
It's aconite.

11:54.886 --> 11:58.200
One of my mum's homeopathic
remedies.

11:58.234 --> 12:00.754
-What, you mean one of those New
Age, unscientific things

12:00.789 --> 12:02.066
you don't believe in?

12:02.100 --> 12:04.551
-Yep, it's basically
sugar pills

12:04.585 --> 12:06.139
covered in plant extracts.

12:06.173 --> 12:09.211
They sort of just make you
think yourself better.

12:09.245 --> 12:11.109
All right, open.

12:11.144 --> 12:12.386
Right.

12:12.421 --> 12:13.767
If that doesn't work,
pop in another one.

12:13.802 --> 12:14.906
They can't run you down.

12:18.634 --> 12:19.462
-You can't tell them, Mads.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.361
This is my secret, too.

12:21.395 --> 12:23.432
-Sorry, Rhydian, but I can't
live like this anymore.

12:26.228 --> 12:27.194
-Maddy.

12:27.229 --> 12:27.781
-When the times right--

12:27.816 --> 12:28.575
-Maddy

12:28.609 --> 12:29.300
- --I'll do what I have to.

12:29.334 --> 12:30.266
-Stop it.

12:30.301 --> 12:31.405
-Do you smell those burgers?

12:31.440 --> 12:32.372
-Maddy, no.

12:32.406 --> 12:33.545
-I'm starving.

12:33.580 --> 12:34.995
-Maddy, no.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.790
-I need meat.

12:36.825 --> 12:37.480
-You're not going in there.

12:37.515 --> 12:38.930
Can't you smell it?

12:38.965 --> 12:40.035
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: I'm not
letting you do this.

12:40.069 --> 12:41.795
MADDY [REMEMBERING]:
Let me go.

12:41.830 --> 12:42.209
Ugh!

12:42.244 --> 12:42.623
Ugh!

12:42.658 --> 12:43.521
Argh!

12:43.555 --> 12:44.246
-You need the bathroom.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.557
-I need meat.

12:45.592 --> 12:46.455
Ugh!

12:46.489 --> 12:47.283
Ooh!

12:47.318 --> 12:48.491
-What's happening?

12:48.526 --> 12:49.803
-Uh, Maddy's sick.

12:49.838 --> 12:50.597
-I'm not sick.

12:50.631 --> 12:51.909
I'm hungry.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.499
You stop!

12:59.571 --> 13:00.400
-Maddy.

13:00.434 --> 13:02.091
-Look, look.

13:02.126 --> 13:04.197
Do you want your friends
to see you like this?

13:04.231 --> 13:05.129
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy?

13:05.163 --> 13:06.130
-I'll be down in a minute.

13:06.164 --> 13:07.994
I'm just feeling a bit weird.

13:08.028 --> 13:09.167
-Turn your wolf off.

13:09.202 --> 13:10.513
-This isn't me.

13:10.548 --> 13:11.929
-Well it must be.

13:11.963 --> 13:12.653
[knocking]

13:12.688 --> 13:14.034
-I'm being sick.

13:14.069 --> 13:14.863
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy.

13:14.897 --> 13:16.002
-It's not.

13:16.036 --> 13:17.382
-Your not doing this?

13:17.417 --> 13:18.418
-No, I swear.

13:18.452 --> 13:19.522
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy.

13:19.557 --> 13:20.247
-The pill.

13:20.282 --> 13:21.490
-What?

13:21.524 --> 13:22.905
-This happened after
you took that pill.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.596
-Like an allergic reaction?

13:24.631 --> 13:25.459
-Maybe.

13:25.494 --> 13:27.013
-Rhydian, open the door.

13:27.047 --> 13:28.221
[knocking]

13:28.255 --> 13:29.084
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy.

13:29.118 --> 13:30.257
-How do I turn it off?

13:30.292 --> 13:31.500
-All right , stay here,
lock the door.

13:31.534 --> 13:32.812
-You can't open--

13:38.265 --> 13:40.095
-She's in a bad way,
temperature's through the

13:40.129 --> 13:41.268
roof.

13:41.303 --> 13:42.131
-Since when are you
a medical expert?

13:42.166 --> 13:42.960
Look, my mum's a doctor.

13:42.994 --> 13:43.684
Let me look at her.

13:43.719 --> 13:44.513
-No, she's being sick.

13:44.547 --> 13:45.548
I should take her home.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.411
-I can take her home.

13:46.446 --> 13:47.412
-Well, you're cooking.

13:47.447 --> 13:48.655
-What is it with you, Rhydian?

13:48.689 --> 13:49.449
Why do you want to get
Maddy on her own?

13:49.483 --> 13:50.174
-I'm not.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.451
-Yes you are.

13:51.485 --> 13:52.935
Just admit you fancy her
and stop pretending.

13:52.970 --> 13:53.660
-I'm not pretending.

13:53.694 --> 13:54.937
-Boys!

13:54.972 --> 13:56.559
We will all take her home.

13:56.594 --> 13:57.422
-But that's pointless.

13:57.457 --> 14:00.184
I can do it.

14:00.218 --> 14:02.496
Shannon.

14:02.531 --> 14:05.051
Shannon, Shannon.

14:05.085 --> 14:06.052
Where you going?

14:06.086 --> 14:08.951
He's just jealous, that's all.

14:08.986 --> 14:10.090
Shannon.

14:15.026 --> 14:17.995
-If we all take her, we can go
on to the moors from there.

14:18.029 --> 14:19.548
-It's on the other side
of the village.

14:19.582 --> 14:21.412
Look, if I take Maddy home,
then you can just go from

14:21.446 --> 14:23.310
here, with Rhydian.

14:23.345 --> 14:26.382
-You'll do anything to get out
of this beast hunt, won't you?

14:26.417 --> 14:29.213
-No, I'm just thinking
about Maddy.

14:29.247 --> 14:31.594
[smoke detector beeping]

14:31.629 --> 14:32.872
-Ah, the burgers!

14:37.773 --> 14:39.050
-Maddy.

14:42.536 --> 14:43.986
-Can't you smell it?

14:44.021 --> 14:45.125
I'm ravenous.

14:45.160 --> 14:45.988
-You're not going down there.

14:46.023 --> 14:46.989
-I need meat!

14:47.024 --> 14:48.680
-Wait, you've got to see this.

14:52.961 --> 14:54.238
-I noticed Rhydian's
vanished again.

14:54.272 --> 14:55.101
-Stupid thing.

14:55.135 --> 14:57.551
How do you turn it off?

14:57.586 --> 14:58.932
-He's gone back to
the bathroom.

15:03.005 --> 15:08.217
-This says aconite is also
known as wolfsbane.

15:08.252 --> 15:09.115
[knocking]

15:09.149 --> 15:10.288
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy?

15:10.323 --> 15:11.393
-In folklore, consuming
wolfsbane was

15:11.427 --> 15:12.428
supposed to turn people--

15:12.463 --> 15:13.395
[knocking]

15:13.429 --> 15:15.086
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: You decent?

15:15.121 --> 15:17.123
- --into werewolves, which is
obviously rubbish, unless--

15:17.157 --> 15:18.365
-You're a wolfblood.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.470
-Exactly.

15:19.504 --> 15:20.574
How to protect from
werewolves.

15:20.609 --> 15:21.748
What to do when a
werewolf bites.

15:25.614 --> 15:27.029
-I wasn't eavesdropping.

15:27.064 --> 15:28.582
I just wondered what you
and Rhydian were up to.

15:28.617 --> 15:32.207
-Anecdote to wolfsbane.

15:32.241 --> 15:34.036
-Tom.

15:34.071 --> 15:37.281
You smell yummy.

15:37.315 --> 15:38.454
-I do?

15:38.489 --> 15:39.697
-This is it.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.389
Thistle root is said to
quiet the werewolf.

15:42.424 --> 15:43.528
[sniffing]

15:43.563 --> 15:45.082
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:45.116 --> 15:46.290
You said you didn't give me
a second thought before.

15:46.324 --> 15:47.808
-You didn't smell like
this before.

15:47.843 --> 15:50.018
-Well, this is just-- just
cheap aftershave from

15:50.052 --> 15:51.019
Bernie's, Mads.

15:51.053 --> 15:53.021
[growling]

15:53.055 --> 15:55.471
-I'm going to go make burgers.

15:55.506 --> 15:56.403
-Maddy!

15:56.438 --> 15:58.819
[smoke detector beeping]

15:58.854 --> 16:01.063
-That girl definitely
has a fever.

16:01.098 --> 16:02.099
-Maddy, come on.

16:02.133 --> 16:05.033
You really need meat,
just wait.

16:05.067 --> 16:05.757
Lock the door.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.139
Lock it.

16:08.174 --> 16:09.071
[smoke detector beeping]

16:09.106 --> 16:12.074
-Why won't it switch off?

16:12.109 --> 16:13.041
[smoke detector beeping]

16:13.075 --> 16:14.214
-Ugh!

16:17.424 --> 16:18.529
Oh, pooh!

16:21.083 --> 16:22.119
Oh!

16:22.153 --> 16:25.260
-Uh, I think the burgers
are done.

16:25.294 --> 16:27.365
-Oh!

16:27.400 --> 16:28.677
[growling]

16:28.711 --> 16:30.644
-You knew Maddy fancied
me, didn't you?

16:30.679 --> 16:32.612
-Maddy, fancy you?

16:32.646 --> 16:34.234
-She literally threw herself
at me, upstairs.

16:34.269 --> 16:35.684
It's cool.

16:35.718 --> 16:37.134
I know nothing's going to happen
between us, it's just--

16:37.168 --> 16:38.273
hm.

16:42.415 --> 16:44.486
Oh, hey.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.316
He's so jealous.

16:47.351 --> 16:48.283
-Jealous?

16:48.317 --> 16:49.525
-That's what it's all about.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.079
-Oh, you and Maddy.

16:51.113 --> 16:52.597
-Oh, come on, Shan.

16:52.632 --> 16:54.427
I know you girls talk about
that kind of stuff.

16:54.461 --> 16:56.739
And I understand you keeping
Maddy's feelings a secret.

16:56.774 --> 16:58.465
That's what friends do.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.744
It's just nice to know that I'm
not invisible after all.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.415
-Nice start up.

17:17.450 --> 17:18.589
Where's the main course?

17:23.180 --> 17:24.353
-Maddy's fixed.

17:24.387 --> 17:25.492
-She's being sick.

17:25.527 --> 17:26.700
-Oh, stop playing
games, you two.

17:26.734 --> 17:28.323
I know what's going on.

17:28.357 --> 17:30.152
Maddy, if you'd rather have
two boys fighting over you

17:30.187 --> 17:32.085
than beast hunt with
me, well then you

17:32.120 --> 17:33.845
should have just said.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.400
Your stuff's out here, so
you might as well just

17:36.434 --> 17:38.195
leave, right now.

17:41.336 --> 17:42.716
-Right.

17:42.751 --> 17:43.131
You're not going anywhere until
the coast is clear.

17:50.241 --> 17:51.139
-What are you doing?

17:51.173 --> 17:52.830
-Beast hunting.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.142
-Well, what about the food?

17:57.283 --> 17:58.594
Don't chuck it all out.

17:58.629 --> 18:01.356
It's bait.

18:01.390 --> 18:04.876
Ju-- look, why don't you two
just go and take Maddy home?

18:04.911 --> 18:06.430
It's clearly what
you'd rather do.

18:09.433 --> 18:10.399
-What did you say to her?

18:10.434 --> 18:11.366
-I didn't say anything.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.401
What did you say?

18:14.438 --> 18:15.646
-Do you think she'll be
all right on her own?

18:15.680 --> 18:16.785
I mean if the thing we
saw last month is

18:16.819 --> 18:18.718
still out there, th--

18:18.752 --> 18:19.615
-No.

18:19.650 --> 18:20.789
Wait for me.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.450
[knocking]

18:26.484 --> 18:27.140
-Maddy, right now
is your chance.

18:27.175 --> 18:28.141
OK?

18:28.176 --> 18:28.969
Give us two minutes to leave.

18:29.004 --> 18:30.488
Go straight home, all right?

18:30.523 --> 18:31.627
Maddy?

18:31.662 --> 18:32.766
-Yes!

18:43.639 --> 18:44.778
-Maddy's taking herself home.

19:00.311 --> 19:01.209
[growling]

19:01.243 --> 19:04.488
-I need meat!

19:04.522 --> 19:07.560
Meat, meat.

19:07.594 --> 19:10.252
I need meat!

19:10.287 --> 19:12.530
Meat!

19:12.565 --> 19:14.636
-How long have you known
Maddy fancied me?

19:14.670 --> 19:16.431
-Maddy doesn't fancy you.

19:16.465 --> 19:17.811
-Whatever.

19:17.846 --> 19:19.330
-Did you seriously think you
have a chance together?

19:19.365 --> 19:20.400
-Of course not.

19:20.435 --> 19:21.919
-Then what's your point?

19:21.953 --> 19:24.473
-My point is you acting all
jealous, like you've got some

19:24.508 --> 19:25.681
sort of claim on her.

19:25.716 --> 19:26.855
-Fine.

19:26.889 --> 19:27.545
You win.

19:27.580 --> 19:28.684
I'm jealous.

19:28.719 --> 19:29.375
Now can we focus on
Shannon please?

19:29.409 --> 19:30.479
-100%.

19:30.514 --> 19:30.928
Just wanted to here
you say it.

19:30.962 --> 19:31.998
Ugh!

19:32.032 --> 19:34.345
Aw, thistles, they're
everywhere.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.519
-Thistles?

19:39.488 --> 19:41.628
-Aw, man!

19:41.663 --> 19:43.872
Thought it was my burger,
but it is sheep poop.

19:46.633 --> 19:47.738
What are you doing?

19:51.431 --> 19:54.538
-This is a good weapon,
just in case.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.578
[wolf howling]

20:04.341 --> 20:06.619
-It's behind us.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.068
-Wuh--wuh-- where you going?

20:08.103 --> 20:09.518
-Maddy.

20:09.553 --> 20:10.485
-Yeah, Maddy's either at
home or at the house.

20:10.519 --> 20:11.900
We need to go find Shannon.

20:11.934 --> 20:13.004
-But I just--

20:13.039 --> 20:14.454
-You're not getting
out of this now.

20:14.489 --> 20:15.421
Maddy's safe.

20:15.455 --> 20:15.869
She can take care of herself.

20:15.904 --> 20:16.870
Come on.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.238
-Meat!

20:45.140 --> 20:46.037
Meat!

20:46.072 --> 20:47.004
Meat!

20:47.038 --> 20:47.970
Meat!

20:48.005 --> 20:49.248
Meat!

20:52.354 --> 20:54.114
Meat!

20:54.149 --> 20:56.979
Meat!

20:57.014 --> 20:59.430
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Shannon?

20:59.465 --> 21:00.569
-Over here.

21:04.090 --> 21:06.748
-Did hear that howl?

21:06.782 --> 21:07.749
-I heard it.

21:07.783 --> 21:10.890
-I hope it's not stalking us.

21:10.924 --> 21:12.512
-Why aren't you taking
Maddy home?

21:12.547 --> 21:13.824
-What?

21:13.858 --> 21:15.066
And leave you to face the
beast on your own?

21:15.101 --> 21:15.895
What kind of friends do
you think we are?

21:15.929 --> 21:16.999
-Maddy's friends.

21:17.034 --> 21:18.311
-She's really ill.

21:18.346 --> 21:19.623
I think it was that
pill you gave her.

21:19.657 --> 21:21.556
It's was about 10 years past
it's used by date.

21:21.590 --> 21:22.419
-She's not faking it?

21:22.453 --> 21:23.592
-No.

21:23.627 --> 21:24.938
All she wanted was to
be here for you.

21:24.973 --> 21:27.009
I was trying to stop her.

21:27.044 --> 21:29.080
-Oh, I feel terrible, now.

21:29.115 --> 21:31.013
-Can we focus on the
beast, please?

21:31.048 --> 21:31.669
-All right.

21:31.704 --> 21:32.739
Follow me.

21:32.774 --> 21:33.637
-Follow you?

21:33.671 --> 21:34.707
But he's following us.

21:40.057 --> 21:41.334
-Maddy.

21:55.417 --> 21:56.625
-This is perfect.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.903
We are so going to see
the beast tonight.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.394
-Meat!

22:27.760 --> 22:28.485
Ugh!

22:28.519 --> 22:29.796
-All right, stop!

22:29.831 --> 22:30.935
-Did you hear that?

22:35.077 --> 22:35.768
-Ugh!

22:35.802 --> 22:36.527
-Is that you?

22:38.529 --> 22:42.533
-Oh, very funny.

22:42.568 --> 22:43.638
Hilarious.

22:43.672 --> 22:45.916
You've scared the
beast off now.

22:45.950 --> 22:46.917
-Sorry.

22:46.951 --> 22:48.125
-Thanks a bunch.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.437
[sneezing]

22:53.164 --> 22:55.235
-Are you really going to spend
all night looking at these?

22:55.270 --> 22:57.652
-I can't believe we didn't
get anything.

22:57.686 --> 23:01.414
-There will be other
times, Shan.

23:01.449 --> 23:02.622
-What were you doing
out there, anyway?

23:02.657 --> 23:04.244
I thought you were supposed
to be ill.

23:04.279 --> 23:06.557
-I didn't want to
let you down.

23:06.592 --> 23:09.595
-How did you know
where we were?

23:09.629 --> 23:11.804
-I didn't.

23:11.838 --> 23:14.910
-I'm sorry, Maddy, for all
those mean things I said.

23:14.945 --> 23:17.499
-I didn't have the best
reaction to that pill.

23:17.534 --> 23:20.744
I mean, I don't remember
doing anything.

23:20.778 --> 23:23.022
-So you don't remember throwing
yourself at Tom?

23:23.056 --> 23:24.644
-Tom?

23:24.679 --> 23:26.094
I threw myself at Tom?

23:26.128 --> 23:27.406
-According to him, you did.

23:30.063 --> 23:32.445
-Oh, my--

23:32.480 --> 23:34.033
-Don't worry.

23:34.067 --> 23:38.796
He was going on about how you
two will only ever be friends.

23:38.831 --> 23:42.110
I think he was just glad
of the attention.

23:42.144 --> 23:46.079
-Normal service has
been resumed.

23:46.114 --> 23:50.083
We have toast and jam,
marmalade, peanut butter, slab

23:50.118 --> 23:52.776
of ham, tomatoes, and cheese.

23:52.810 --> 23:54.053
And I think that's it.

23:54.087 --> 23:55.468
Oh, and Rhydian's
bringing drinks.

23:55.503 --> 23:56.642
-I'll give him a hand.

24:02.958 --> 24:04.477
A lucky break, huh?

24:04.512 --> 24:07.100
-You could say that.

24:07.135 --> 24:09.965
-I can still taste
the thistle root.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.311
-I had no choice.

24:11.346 --> 24:12.140
-I know.

24:12.174 --> 24:13.106
Thanks.

24:13.141 --> 24:14.901
-Still can't spill the beans.

24:14.936 --> 24:15.730
-No.

24:15.764 --> 24:18.146
Not now.

24:18.180 --> 24:19.078
Shannon's happy.

24:19.112 --> 24:20.286
-Yeah, so is Tom.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.979
He thinks I'm, uh, jealous
of you and him.

24:24.014 --> 24:25.878
-Oh yeah?

24:25.912 --> 24:27.776
-Don't push your luck, Maddy.

24:27.811 --> 24:29.260
-Sorry.

24:29.295 --> 24:32.229
It's just really good to be
normal again, doing normal

24:32.263 --> 24:34.887
gossipy things, with
normal people.

24:37.372 --> 24:38.718
-There's nothing normal
about your friends.

24:44.759 --> 24:49.764
