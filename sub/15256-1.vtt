WEBVTT

01:12.698 --> 01:14.448
Jose, let's go!

01:26.712 --> 01:29.922
Jose, get up!
You're going to be late!

01:50.152 --> 01:53.072
Miguel, hurry up!
Don't you ever leave the bathroom?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.322
"Miguel, hurry up.

01:54.573 --> 01:55.967
Don't you ever leave the bathroom?"

01:55.991 --> 01:57.631
- You need to go the the restroom?
- Yeah.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.083
Aww. Aww.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.709
Miguel, that's not even funny!

02:03.707 --> 02:04.917
Really?
You locked the door?

02:05.167 --> 02:08.497
A long river. A long river!

02:14.551 --> 02:15.891
- It smells good.
- Oh, no, no.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.546
Over there. Over there.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.773
Why don't you get up
when I ask you to get up?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.786
That way you wouldn't be
running late all the time.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.650
Here you go.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.654
How come Miguel gets more?

02:28.899 --> 02:30.543
Your brother needs
all the protein he can get

02:30.567 --> 02:31.897
for his big game tonight.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.546
He probably won't eat
anything anyway.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.410
He's to busy plucking
his eyebrows like a girl.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.736
- Yeah?
- Oh, man, come on.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.531
Stop playing.
Stop. Come on.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.535
I'm late. Please.
Did you wash your hands?

02:41.787 --> 02:43.907
Spotless.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.134
Come on, mom.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.996
Oye, mijo. Here.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.302
You're still hungry?
Eat this.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.469
Really, mom?
Expired cereal?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.798
Jose, what is your problem?

02:59.054 --> 03:01.184
I told you I'm going to be late!

03:01.431 --> 03:03.159
- You keep shouting all the time.
- No, sit down.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.143
Sit down and eat!
Sit down and eat, okay?

03:05.394 --> 03:07.354
- I don't want you to be late.
- Okay. Okay.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.614
It's a big day, you know?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.375
You've been waiting
for this a long time.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.599
Hopefully, after tonight's game
you'll get scholarships.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.146
Oh, please, god.
Please, god.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.782
You okay?
You're not feeling sick, are you?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.162
No. Mom, can you stop?

03:20.409 --> 03:22.369
Okay.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.579
You know, I have a chess game
today against Dani.

03:24.830 --> 03:29.330
And if I win, Dani buys me
lunch and dessert.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.376
That's nice, mijo. Eat.
You're okay?

03:32.629 --> 03:35.669
- You're feeling okay today?
- Yeah, I'm fine, mom.

03:43.223 --> 03:47.063
Buenos Dias, Jose.
Did you eat?

03:48.645 --> 03:52.435
Welcome to Abuelita's
specialty restaurant.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.862
This is real sausage.
I'll make it for you.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.816
- That's okay.
- Eh?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.485
- What do you want to drink?
- How about a soda?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.615
Ay, you're loco.

04:06.872 --> 04:09.002
Let's see.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.329
How about some coffee?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.385
Abuelita, I don't drink coffee.
I'm too young.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.628
Too young? I've been drinking coffee
since I was six years old.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.632
Keeps you warm when
you're working out in the fields.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.635
No, thanks.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.242
you know, I have a chess game
today against Dani.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.407
Do you remember
the last techniques I taught you?

04:40.614 --> 04:44.244
- I practiced all night.
- Go easy on that poor kid, huh?

04:53.919 --> 04:56.089
- You're it.
- Stop.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.255
What's wrong?

05:01.510 --> 05:03.550
Did you get in a fight
with your mom again?

05:04.888 --> 05:07.888
- With Miguel?
- Cut it out.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.900
- You're such a butthead.
- You're a double butthead.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.726
- A double butthead? Really?
- Yeah.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.686
All right, stand over here.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.303
Put your hands
on the hood, please.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.494
You don't have
any weapons on you?

05:21.738 --> 05:23.908
Get in the car.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.907
Let's go check it out.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.909
- No.
- What?

05:29.538 --> 05:31.708
Let's go through
the cemetery instead.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.917
- But we're going to be late.
- It's a shortcut.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.917
- You scared?
- No way, weirdo.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.460
Last one there gets first start
for the chess match.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.054
- Three...
- Two...

05:43.134 --> 05:45.224
Cheater!

05:47.347 --> 05:51.847
<i>If there was a song
of the story of us</i>

05:52.978 --> 05:57.478
<i>it wouldn't have a refrain</i>

05:57.774 --> 05:59.944
<i>it'd be a hundred verses</i>

06:00.193 --> 06:02.323
<i>and never the same</i>

06:02.571 --> 06:06.161
<i>like coming back round again</i>

06:08.368 --> 06:09.738
<i>I'd play it</i>

06:09.995 --> 06:11.745
<i>and you would understand it</i>

06:11.997 --> 06:14.537
<i>and give it just the right name</i>

06:14.791 --> 06:17.131
<i>la de da, la de da</i>

06:17.377 --> 06:19.877
<i>oh, la de da da</i>

06:20.130 --> 06:22.760
<i>la de da, la de da</i>

06:23.008 --> 06:25.758
- da da
- come on.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.181
Come on!
You throw like a girl!

06:29.431 --> 06:30.991
Do something!
Throw it home! Throw it...

06:32.434 --> 06:33.564
He got you right on the...

06:35.395 --> 06:36.975
Quit throwing like a pansy!

06:37.230 --> 06:39.230
You got to man up!
Oh, yeah, baby!

06:39.482 --> 06:41.782
You better watch out.
She's got an arm!

06:42.027 --> 06:44.067
- Whoa!
- Ow!

06:44.321 --> 06:46.161
That's the bell!

06:46.406 --> 06:48.366
That's it, that's it. That's the bell.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.789
Goodness.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.037
I'm sorry, man.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.788
What's your deal, man?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.370
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.165
- Enough!
- What are you doing?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.628
That's enough. That's enough!

06:59.878 --> 07:02.008
What the hell are you idiots...

07:03.840 --> 07:05.010
I mean...

07:06.635 --> 07:07.835
You guys really disappoint me.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.801
- He started it.
- You, young lady,

07:10.055 --> 07:11.295
need to mind your own business.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.391
And stop acting like catwoman,
jumping all over everybody.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.853
Go inside. Go inside.
I'll deal with you later.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.813
Go. Go!

07:21.858 --> 07:24.438
You, too. Not you.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.609
Jose, what's the matter with you?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.625
You should try and be
more like your brother.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.624
Why? Because I don't play
as good as him?

07:32.869 --> 07:34.829
He's striving for the championship.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.640
You could learn
a thing or two from him.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.328
Whatever.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.959
- How did you do that?
- Can't tell you.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.255
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Check.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.639
- Well, then...
- You know what's funny?

07:50.887 --> 07:54.217
- I knew you were going to do that.
- Huh. Check.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.434
I knew you were going to do that.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.435
Are you sure, Dani?
I hate doing this.

08:00.689 --> 08:01.939
No fair. No!

08:02.190 --> 08:05.860
- Oh, yeah, it was.
- Nice job, Jose.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.451
I saw how you skewered her king.

08:08.697 --> 08:09.947
You dominated the board.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.028
That's because he pressured me.
This game doesn't count.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.084
No, no, no.
I want my pepperoni pizza.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.078
- No.
- You know,

08:17.330 --> 08:18.370
you have killer instincts.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.500
Thanks.
And we had a deal.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.460
- No.
- See? Look, you got to move here.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.341
You know,
you're just like your brother.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.400
Are you ready to cheer him on
in tonight's game?

08:27.424 --> 08:29.884
Why does everybody
keep asking me about Miguel?

08:30.135 --> 08:31.755
Is today national Miguel day?

08:47.986 --> 08:49.236
Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:49.487 --> 08:50.697
Jose!

08:50.947 --> 08:52.317
What are you thinking?

08:52.574 --> 08:54.510
You just bought yourself a trip
to the principal's office.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.584
Come on, let's go!

09:00.957 --> 09:04.287
You know...

09:04.544 --> 09:08.304
There's a word that describes

09:08.548 --> 09:11.298
what you did out there,

09:11.551 --> 09:13.301
and it's on the tip of my tongue.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.893
I can't remember...
Oh, yeah.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.718
Stupid.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.770
"Stupid" is a word I thought
I'd never hang on you, Jose.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.260
And there's nothing you can say

09:23.396 --> 09:24.796
to convince me
that you're innocent.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.691
And I've heard
all the excuses, trust me.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.321
"They made me do it."

09:28.568 --> 09:30.778
"My girlfriend
wanted me to do it."

09:31.029 --> 09:32.949
I did it.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.658
I wanted to do it.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.328
I would do it again.

09:36.576 --> 09:41.076
Well, since you're being
so abnormally honest,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.961
what punishment
would you impose on thyself?

09:44.209 --> 09:46.669
If my brother did it,
you wouldn't punish him.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.960
Is that what you surmise?

09:48.213 --> 09:49.963
Everyone let's the champion slide.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.125
That's all you care about,
and you know it!

09:57.597 --> 10:01.387
Feeling a little destructive today,
aren't we?

10:03.019 --> 10:06.769
If you spent more time
acting like a champion

10:07.023 --> 10:10.483
and less time envying them,
you wouldn't be here,

10:10.735 --> 10:13.195
or in after school detention,

10:13.446 --> 10:14.965
which is where you're going
for the next two weeks.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.569
- Come on.
- You want me to make it three?

10:18.827 --> 10:21.407
Where you going?
Sit your butt right back down.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.213
You don't leave
until I tell you to go.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.007
What do you...
What do you have there?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.586
Cherry jawbreaker.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.304
My mom brought it from Mexico.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.595
- Cherry jawbreaker, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.810
Here. Why don't you have it?

10:45.061 --> 10:47.061
All right.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.813
Let's just consider this payment

10:52.068 --> 10:56.568
in lieu of the damages that
I'm not charging you for, okay?

10:57.574 --> 11:00.294
You just try and keep
your hands to yourself.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.620
And just remember
one thing, Jose.

11:04.455 --> 11:08.535
The privilege of a lifetime
is being who you are.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.256
Put that there in the bank.
Run with it.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.836
Go on.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.484
- No, I like the chicharones.
- Hey, Jose. You got a second?

11:33.443 --> 11:34.653
Poor kid.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.493
He doesn't have half the talent
that Miguel does.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.630
Jose, you need to sit down
and do your homework.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.204
How are you?

12:23.201 --> 12:26.121
I'm bringing back the chess club

12:26.371 --> 12:28.291
and I want you to be in it.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.539
I don't know how many students
I'm going to be able to recruit

12:35.171 --> 12:37.381
or if we're even
going to get anywhere.

12:41.970 --> 12:46.140
If you join the team,
I'll get you out of this detention.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.940
Nobody plays chess around here.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.727
I'll teach them.

12:53.982 --> 12:54.982
Teach who?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.937
Them.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.565
Good luck with that.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.373
Think about it.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.253
Check.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.518
Hey, why you getting
home so late?

13:29.767 --> 13:32.307
- They gave me detention.
- Why?

13:32.562 --> 13:35.862
- Because I broke Miguel's trophy.
- Why would you do that?

13:36.107 --> 13:37.397
I felt like it.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.780
You felt like it?
You felt... get in the house.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.840
I'm going to teach you
about feeling something.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.784
Get in the house right now, Jose.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.493
Get in the...
Are you kidding me?

13:46.743 --> 13:49.003
Jose! You better get...

13:49.245 --> 13:52.575
If I hurt myself, you are
going to get in so much...

13:52.832 --> 13:55.172
I swear, if I...
You're going to be grounded,

13:55.418 --> 13:56.958
I swear to god.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.211
I can't believe you!

14:01.257 --> 14:03.467
Jos... oh, god,
where'd he go?

14:03.718 --> 14:06.638
Boy, where are you?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.216
Jose!

14:22.695 --> 14:25.655
- What happened to you?
- Shh.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.237
- My god, what a foul smell.
- Shh! Abuela!

14:28.493 --> 14:30.243
Let us get you
out of those clothes

14:30.495 --> 14:32.655
before people think
there's a skunk in my house!

14:34.248 --> 14:36.628
Shut the door. Hurry.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.457
What did you do? What's going on?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.631
I'm not here.
Please, go cover for me.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.183
Please. Please.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.467
Have you seen Jose?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.159
I can't find him.
He's in big trouble.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.853
- Is he here?
- No.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.853
Maybe he went to Dani's house.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.874
That little brat got detention.
Can you believe that?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.334
If he comes here,
send him home, okay?

15:00.358 --> 15:02.858
Oh, I will, Mija, Si.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.701
- Now, Mija...
- Mom, please, please.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.486
- Just send him home, okay?
- Okay.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.291
oye, I am going to teach you

15:17.542 --> 15:20.632
one of your grandpa's
favorite strategies.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.668
- I don't feel like it, Abuelita.
- Come on, Jose.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.553
You know that when you play,
it makes you feel better.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.511
This one is special.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.891
It's called
"home away from home."

15:32.140 --> 15:36.520
If I bring out
my pawn king to e4.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.109
You bring out
your pawn king to e5.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.529
There you go.

15:46.779 --> 15:51.279
I bring out my knight to f3.

15:54.162 --> 15:57.122
You bring out your knight to c6.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.537
Mmm.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.916
I bring out my bishop to c4.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.137
Ahh.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.668
Okay, everybody, come in!

16:40.875 --> 16:42.075
Okay, okay, okay.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.795
All right, I want everybody's
attention, please.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.166
First of all, welcome.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.822
And for all y'all
who don't know me,

16:48.007 --> 16:51.717
I am the mother of the best
soccer player on this planet.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.389
The universe!

16:54.472 --> 16:56.812
All I have to say is
David Beckham better watch out

16:57.058 --> 16:59.098
because my baby's coming.
Ain't that right, sweetie?

16:59.227 --> 17:02.767
He is going to get a big scholarship
to a big college

17:03.022 --> 17:06.321
and he's going to kick
some soccer Booty. Yeah!

17:06.567 --> 17:07.567
That's right.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.528
Let's get them a drink.
Come on, who wants something?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.832
Not you guys.
Yeah, right here. Right here.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.787
We got some soda
back there for you somewhere.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.998
Mom, I'm going to head out
with the guys for a bit.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.829
- Okay?
- Oh, you are?

17:24.085 --> 17:26.104
We're starving. We haven't
had anything to eat all day.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.731
We're just going to pick up
some burgers and be right back.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.005
Come right back, because
you have to ice this shoulder.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.638
- Mom, it's fine.
- Can I go with you?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.425
- I want a burger.
- Um... just stay here.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.600
Stay here for a bit, okay?
I'll bring you something, all right?

17:38.849 --> 17:42.639
Number five?
No tomatoes, toasted buns.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.435
I got you. All right.
I'll see you in a bit.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.663
Jose, will you throw out
the garbage, please?

18:11.841 --> 18:13.051
To the champions, boys!

18:13.301 --> 18:15.721
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!
- Oh, snap!

18:15.970 --> 18:19.850
And here, fellas, is to finally
getting out of this dump.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.599
- Yes, sir.
- Here we go, boys. Whoo!

18:26.522 --> 18:28.232
It's cold.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.732
Party, guys!

18:29.984 --> 18:32.284
- Oh, no, you did not!
- Oh, no.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.728
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.366
You holding back from us, bro?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.656
- Yikes.
- Give me that.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.095
Don't do it.
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.599
What are you doing,
designated driver?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.120
Why am I always
the designated driver?

18:44.373 --> 18:46.963
Because you wanted to drive
your blue power ranger car.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.887
We won!
We won the game!

18:58.137 --> 19:00.097
- We won!
- My ass is buzzing, bro.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.098
- That's disgusting.
- Where is it?

19:02.350 --> 19:04.110
- Don't ever say that again.
- Ole, ole, ole!

19:04.143 --> 19:07.103
Hey, I got a text.
Oh, this girl, bro! Damn.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.105
- We won the game!
- Damn, she fine.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.227
- Look at this girl.
- That's your mom's name.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.524
- Pretty hot.
- Watch this.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.283
Whoa!

19:32.421 --> 19:35.921
May the blessing of almighty god,
the father, the son

19:36.175 --> 19:39.335
and the holy spirit,
come down on you.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.965
- Amen.
- Amen.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.595
I ruined his trophy at school.

20:22.847 --> 20:26.387
Sometimes brothers do that.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.606
Why did this happen?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.817
I don't know, mijo.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.910
I'm trying to understand myself.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.634
Come on.
Let's go home.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.629
Andale.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.430
Hey.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.259
I didn't know
you were back already.

21:05.514 --> 21:08.104
Why didn't you wait
for me this morning?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.890
I didn't feel like it.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.654
Do you want to hang
after school?

21:12.897 --> 21:14.647
I brought my game boy.
Barn!

21:14.899 --> 21:16.569
Nah.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.067
Guitar hero?
I'll let you win.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.990
I have detention.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.238
Yay! So do I.
Come on.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.742
It's called the nimzo-Indian.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.076
Welcome, Jose.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.459
Okay, you guys
already know the routine.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.462
- Here. Let's do it.
- Take out your pieces.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.556
Jose, I'm the new detention teacher.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.057
And it's now officially
chess team practice.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.270
If any of you
want regular detention,

21:54.522 --> 21:56.917
you can walk down the hallway
and complain to your principal.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.491
I'm sure he'll be happy
to make it more painful for you.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.065
I learned new tactics, Jose.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.490
- Consider yourself warned.
- Why are you doing this?

22:04.740 --> 22:06.780
To learn how
to beat you at chess.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.294
And to win back
that pizza and shake.

22:10.871 --> 22:11.871
Here.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.461
What? You're scared?

22:18.587 --> 22:20.417
I dare you.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.088
You want to double-dare?

22:25.761 --> 22:26.931
Don't hold your breath.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.716
Okay, today we're going to try
a few techniques

22:30.975 --> 22:33.595
that will weaken
your opponent in an instant

22:33.853 --> 22:37.903
and ensure the best possible chance
for a checkmate.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.155
Hi, mom.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.750
Here's some water.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.752
It's important to stay hydrated.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.299
Do you want anything?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.552
I can go get you something.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.274
Anything?

23:32.828 --> 23:33.998
Sorry.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.550
- Abuela?
- Yeah?

23:45.799 --> 23:47.839
How do you know that Miguel
went to heaven?

23:49.428 --> 23:53.928
I know because
he was a good son and brother.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.563
What about when you do
bad things?

24:02.274 --> 24:06.194
Mijo, god watches
our every move,

24:06.445 --> 24:10.945
so it's better to do more good
than bad things in your life.

24:11.617 --> 24:15.907
- And Miguel?
- Yes, he did.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.627
You want to know what I think?

24:21.877 --> 24:23.417
What?

24:23.671 --> 24:27.631
I think your grandfather
is teaching Miguel

24:27.883 --> 24:30.433
how to play chess
just as he taught me.

24:30.678 --> 24:34.258
Really?
Like, right now, maybe?

24:34.515 --> 24:36.015
Oh, yeah.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.556
He loved to teach as much
as he loved to play.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.402
Cool.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.534
This belonged to your Abuelito.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.499
It's a family heirloom.

25:00.749 --> 25:04.129
She will protect you
as she has me.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.261
Wow. Thank you, Abuelita.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.508
Mm-hmm.

25:13.137 --> 25:17.637
And remember what your grandfather
always said about the queen.

25:18.142 --> 25:21.602
Don't use her or I'll lose her.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.318
- My move?
- Yes, your move.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.691
This is what
you call notation books.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.105
Here's when you write down

25:31.363 --> 25:33.083
all your information
on how you make a move.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.240
Take the pencils,
and you can pass them down.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.502
Please don't eat the pencils.
We're going to need them.

25:38.746 --> 25:41.286
Okay, when you're playing chess,
you got to focus on the center.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.934
You got to focus
right in the middle,

25:42.958 --> 25:45.128
because the center
is where you want to be.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.917
Now, the rule of thumb is this,

25:48.172 --> 25:50.672
the weakest pawn is the pawn
closest the the king,

25:50.924 --> 25:54.724
and the art of chess
is about attacking.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.740
But when you're attacking,
you've got to ask yourself,

25:56.764 --> 25:59.734
is that movement some
kind of form of defense?

25:59.975 --> 26:02.095
Or is that movement some
kind of form of attack?

26:02.352 --> 26:04.732
Ask not what your king
can do for you,

26:04.980 --> 26:06.560
but what you can do
for your king.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.685
Shake your pants, everyone.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.567
- You ready, army?
- Begin.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.740
- Pawn a4!
- Good move, Jose.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.615
Attack, and always be attacking.

26:18.869 --> 26:19.949
Pawn to e5.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.164
That's a really good move.
Think, Jose.

26:25.209 --> 26:28.459
Knight to f3.
Come on, bring it.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.672
Right smack in the middle.
This is a new frontier.

26:30.798 --> 26:33.178
And in the frontier
where the battle goes down,

26:33.425 --> 26:36.175
right, it's threat
meeting another threat.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.448
You're going to fight the threat
with another threat.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.762
Knight to c6.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.305
Acknowledge the fact that
she's not fighting aggressively.

26:42.559 --> 26:45.019
- She's thinking about it.
- Bishop, c4.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.560
Absolutely right.
Good move, Jose.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.566
- Feel what they're doing.
- Oh, yeah.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.279
Knight to f6.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.698
- Knight, g5.
- Excellent, Jose.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.791
Now you're using excellent tactics

27:01.036 --> 27:02.536
and you're dominating the board.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.578
Now what are you going to do?

27:04.832 --> 27:06.792
Rook to g8.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.882
I never taught you that move.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.168
Bishop, take f7.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.678
- Check!
- King, e7!

27:15.926 --> 27:17.256
Yeah, Peter!

27:17.511 --> 27:19.431
Capture rook.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.600
I think we're becoming
a real team here.

27:24.935 --> 27:26.095
Regionals are coming up,

27:26.353 --> 27:28.313
and we might just make it.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.694
Okay, let's play one more game,
okay, guys?

27:36.947 --> 27:40.027
What are you doing
bringing the queen out?

27:40.284 --> 27:42.084
Mr. Alvarado wants us
to use the queen.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.407
What?

27:43.662 --> 27:45.752
No, the queen is one
of the most powerful pieces.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.288
She should not be used.

27:47.541 --> 27:50.131
If you expose yourself,
you're done.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.646
That's how your grandfather
taught me to play,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.690
bless his soul, and that's how
I taught you to play.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.054
I know, but he's the coach.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.259
Then he should teach you right.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.639
- He's a retard!
- Abuelita!

27:59.887 --> 28:03.467
Ay! Okay, I'll calm down before
Abuelita gets ghetto on you.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.061
Listen, I have some leftovers
for your mom.

28:08.312 --> 28:09.862
Can you take them when you're done?

28:18.530 --> 28:21.570
Hey, mom.
I brought you some food.

28:21.825 --> 28:26.325
It's on the kitchen table.
Okay?

28:29.917 --> 28:33.087
I can heat it up
for you if you want.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.296
Mom, can you say something?

28:43.347 --> 28:45.557
Why did god take your brother?

28:48.936 --> 28:50.306
I know.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.113
Maybe it should've been me.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.910
Hey, principal Thomas.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.199
Any chance you can make it rain
chess team money?

29:06.453 --> 29:09.123
- We have a chess team?
- Yeah. It's pretty damn awesome.

29:09.373 --> 29:10.693
We've been practicing for months,

29:10.791 --> 29:12.351
and now we're competing
in the district.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.224
Yeah, well, the district
has cut all money

29:14.378 --> 29:17.378
for extracurricular activities,
so I can give you what's leftover,

29:17.631 --> 29:19.031
but I can promise you
it ain't much.

29:19.258 --> 29:23.138
The scraps?
Come on, that's like $5.00.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.467
How am I supposed to get my team
to Dallas this year?

29:25.681 --> 29:27.931
Welcome to Brownsville, Mr. A.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.393
You seen the soccer field?

29:29.643 --> 29:32.733
Coach Stevens' been crying
for over a year to get it re-sod.

29:32.980 --> 29:37.480
Now, my job is to fill that case.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.276
You help me do my job,
then and only then I can help you.

29:40.529 --> 29:44.619
In the meantime, here.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.486
A little donation to the cause.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.793
You can't win if you don't play.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.641
Distractions?

30:11.893 --> 30:13.393
What does "distractions" mean?

30:13.645 --> 30:15.123
It's like when we have homework,

30:15.147 --> 30:17.587
but there's a great movie playing
on TV so we forget to do it.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.291
And the teacher yells at us
the next day.

30:19.401 --> 30:20.401
Yeah!

30:20.610 --> 30:23.200
It can also happen when
we're not focused on our matches

30:23.447 --> 30:25.327
- and end up losing.
- Yeah, there was this kid,

30:25.490 --> 30:28.620
he was picking his nose
through the whole entire match.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.655
- That's a very disgusting example.
- But he does make a point.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.245
Feast your eyes on this.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.088
The checkmates.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.413
Did you see what
their nickname is?

30:47.554 --> 30:50.014
Butt cheek one, butt cheek two,

30:50.265 --> 30:53.095
because they live in
a crackhouse.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.110
Stop!

30:59.358 --> 31:01.028
Do you understand?

31:01.276 --> 31:04.856
The checkmates
are the team to beat.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.573
We need to put
Brownsville on the map

31:07.824 --> 31:10.454
and show them that we exist.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.872
Let's nail this
district match coming up.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.462
You down, dawg?

31:15.707 --> 31:17.037
- Yeah!
- We're down!

31:17.292 --> 31:18.842
- Oh, yeah!
- Down, fool?

31:19.086 --> 31:21.166
- Down with the clown?
- Yeah! Every day!

31:21.421 --> 31:23.051
- You want to be on top, right?
- Yeah!

31:23.298 --> 31:25.618
You are going to go in there
and knock on the door and say,

31:25.717 --> 31:27.427
- "wake up!"
- Yeah!

31:27.677 --> 31:30.097
- "Brownsville is here!"
- Wake up!

31:30.347 --> 31:33.427
Annihilate any crazy distractions
you have in your head

31:33.683 --> 31:35.483
get the boards.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.863
No!

31:44.111 --> 31:46.281
That teacher is crippling
your game.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.990
Abuelita, why are you hating on
Mr. Alvarado?

31:49.241 --> 31:50.661
I'm not hating Mr. Alvarado.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.869
- I just don't like his style.
- I'm learning different now.

31:54.121 --> 31:58.131
Mijo, if you have the best goalie
on your soccer team,

31:58.375 --> 32:01.665
do you move him
to play center or wing?

32:01.920 --> 32:06.420
No! You try to get him
to be a better goalie.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.894
Look at my knight.

32:09.136 --> 32:12.306
Hey, mom. Ls there
anything in your fridge?

32:12.556 --> 32:15.306
Some cold cuts
and fresh bread, Mija.

32:15.559 --> 32:18.309
- Hi, Jose.
- Hey.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.562
Why didn't they make
the king more powerful?

32:20.814 --> 32:23.534
The queen can move anywhere.
He's the king.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.815
Yeah, well,
you can't change the rules.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.989
- Ma, where's the bread?
- So, maybe I'll just go here.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.989
Who's winning?

32:31.241 --> 32:33.701
Look at your queen
and look at mine.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.952
Who's winning?

32:36.204 --> 32:38.464
Never sacrifice your queen
for a killing.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.957
You guys want anything?

32:41.209 --> 32:45.709
Mijo, tomorrow,
just remember what I taught you.

32:47.174 --> 32:51.674
I've been busting my butt
teaching you since you were five.

32:52.262 --> 32:55.932
So don't screw up and make me
throw my flip-flop at your head.

32:56.183 --> 32:59.353
- So much pressure.
- Pressure is good.

33:40.227 --> 33:42.097
Checkmate.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.794
- Your turn.
- I know.

34:04.876 --> 34:09.166
You're new, aren't you?

34:09.422 --> 34:12.431
Yeah.
This is my first tournament.

34:12.676 --> 34:15.346
I'll take it easy on you, then.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.393
- That's okay.
- I insist.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.021
It could possibly traumatize you
if you lose to me.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.824
What do you mean?
Well, I'm a girl,

34:27.065 --> 34:29.645
and some boys can't handle
losing to a girl.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.150
Sometimes they never recover.
Some stop playing forever.

34:33.405 --> 34:37.905
In fact, the last guy that lost
looked just like you,

34:38.284 --> 34:40.745
- but you're cuter.
- That's not going to happen to me.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.866
- Shh.
- Sorry.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.710
Don't be sorry.

34:52.882 --> 34:53.882
Be gone.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.301
Check.

34:56.553 --> 34:59.063
- That's not fair.
- Haven't you heard?

34:59.306 --> 35:00.926
Life isn't fair.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.941
Hmm.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.186
Checkmate.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.158
- What happened?
- I got distracted.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.081
Go pull yourself together

35:23.330 --> 35:24.770
and go support
your fellow teammates.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.456
And keep your mouth shut.

35:26.708 --> 35:29.958
I used my vacation money
for this. Go.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.921
I need mucho cerveza.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.298
- Good match.
- No, it wasn't.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.894
You slaughtered me.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.719
Yeah, I did slaughter you,
but don't worry about it.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.095
- It was your first...
- All right.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.813
- Was your coach mad?
- I think so.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.944
- He asked for a lot of beer.
- Yeah, sometimes they do that.

35:52.192 --> 35:54.282
- It takes the edge off.
- The edge of what?

35:54.527 --> 35:56.339
I don't know.
They don't make sense half the time.

35:56.363 --> 35:59.533
- Oh, true.
- I heard you lost, champ.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.123
- To me. I'm Sandy.
- Hi, Sandy.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.804
Nice going, Jose.
You know how to pick a winner.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.328
He played a solid game.
Be proud of him.

36:06.581 --> 36:09.751
Oh, I'm very proud
of my teammate.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.251
- Ow.
- That's a secret code we use.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.795
Oh! Are you best friends?

36:17.842 --> 36:18.932
Yeah.

36:19.177 --> 36:23.137
Jose, you were so cool,
not like the other guys.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.350
There was this one time
I played a guy...

36:25.600 --> 36:27.200
More like a kid
who thought he was a guy,

36:27.227 --> 36:28.347
Hey, you.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.279
I saw your game earlier.
Not bad.

36:35.819 --> 36:36.819
Thanks.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.780
Looks like you got
your hands full, buddy.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.543
- Let's go, Jose.
- Why?

36:44.786 --> 36:47.456
- Mr. Alvarado is looking for us.
- No, he isn't.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.100
I have to practice
before my next match.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.924
Us winners do that.
Come on, teammate.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.957
Good luck!
You, too, for next time.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.012
What? You look at that!

36:56.256 --> 36:59.296
Look at your shirt!
Look at your shirt, man!

36:59.551 --> 37:02.181
Attention, everyone!

37:02.429 --> 37:06.389
Brownsville brainiacs,
we're headed for the regionals!

37:11.187 --> 37:13.687
- I'll race you.
- Cheater!

37:13.940 --> 37:15.980
Mr. Alvarado,
why do we always have pizza?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.714
Why are you always
complaining, Peter?

37:17.777 --> 37:19.067
He's like a woman!

37:19.320 --> 37:20.920
You want to take it outside
with a woman?

37:21.114 --> 37:22.434
- Let's go! Okay, come on.
- Okay!

37:22.657 --> 37:24.237
Yo, Muhammad Ali!

37:24.492 --> 37:28.002
You want to restrain
that left hook just for the night?

37:28.246 --> 37:30.606
You don't want to knock a brother down
before the big fight!

37:30.749 --> 37:32.629
- Ooh!
- J.C. You're not.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.416
- You're old like dried snot.
- And your school photo

37:35.670 --> 37:36.710
looks like a mugshot.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.423
Oh!

37:39.674 --> 37:41.884
- What!
- Sorry, Mr. Alvarado.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.345
Your bags are in the front.
Grab them.

37:45.472 --> 37:46.852
Can you believe
we got first place?

37:47.098 --> 37:48.418
Yeah. You're still in shock, huh?

37:48.558 --> 37:51.228
- These are awesome.
- We're the bomb.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.240
Hey.

38:01.279 --> 38:05.779
If Miguel were here,
he'd be proud of you.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.656
What?
That I'm a good loser?

38:10.914 --> 38:13.254
She played a good game.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.456
I probably would have
lost to her, too.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.882
Yeah, right.
When hell freezes over.

38:25.512 --> 38:26.892
Can I ask you a question?

38:28.723 --> 38:30.893
Yeah. What?

38:33.728 --> 38:36.058
Why did you want to
avoid the border patrol officers

38:36.314 --> 38:38.542
when they were arresting those guys
on our way to school?

38:38.566 --> 38:42.276
- I wasn't avoiding them.
- Yeah, you were.

38:42.529 --> 38:45.109
- You were scared.
- I wasn't scared.

38:49.536 --> 38:54.036
- Don't you trust me?
- Yes.

38:54.624 --> 38:56.924
Prove it.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.128
My parents just told me
they're not us citizens.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.346
I thought you said
your mom was from Brownsville.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.723
She told me that
so I wouldn't worry.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.807
Swear on your life
you won't tell anyone.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.944
Promise me.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.316
I promise.

39:24.571 --> 39:25.991
I won't tell anyone.

39:27.949 --> 39:32.119
<i>All the trouble I've seen</i>

39:32.370 --> 39:34.830
<i>disappears</i>

39:35.081 --> 39:38.631
<i>into the night</i>

39:38.877 --> 39:43.127
<i>and I know the tighter
I hold on to you</i>

39:43.381 --> 39:45.721
mine's better. See? Look.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.755
The noise makes it all...

39:52.015 --> 39:53.765
- The sound of it.
- Yeah.

39:54.017 --> 39:57.347
Oh!

39:57.604 --> 39:59.444
Ow.

39:59.689 --> 40:02.569
I'm going to remember that.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.217
I'll get you next time
in Dodgeball.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.402
I'll get you.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.363
- You wouldn't.
- I would. I would, too.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.333
- Hey, Abuelita.
- Hey! How did it go?

40:12.577 --> 40:14.077
It went okay.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.829
And? What else?

40:16.080 --> 40:20.250
- That's it.
- Hmm.

40:21.836 --> 40:22.836
I lost.

40:23.046 --> 40:26.466
- I told you, that teacher...
- Abuela, it had nothing to do with him.

40:26.716 --> 40:29.756
It was my fault.
I lost my concentration.

40:30.011 --> 40:33.011
- What do you mean?
- Well, I didn't use my head.

40:33.264 --> 40:37.604
There was girl,
and she was really cute, too.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.812
- Blonde hair and really cute.
- Listen to me.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.624
It wasn't that
you didn't use your head.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.397
- It's that you used the wrong one!
- Abuela!

40:45.652 --> 40:47.612
This is the biggest problem
with a man.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.572
You always lose
when he's in control.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.413
Abuela, can you stop it?
You're traumatizing me.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.140
- I'm trying to save you.
- From what?

40:55.203 --> 40:56.413
From yourself.

40:56.663 --> 40:59.213
- Listen to me...
- Abuela, I know. You told...

40:59.457 --> 41:02.837
- Dirty little bastard, listen...
- Abuela, Abuela! Listen.

41:03.086 --> 41:06.626
I'm tired and I want to go
get some rest.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.841
Please do not disturb me.

41:09.092 --> 41:12.972
Well, excuse me,
Mr. blah-blah-blah.

41:13.221 --> 41:16.641
The king doesn't want to talk.
Typical!

41:16.891 --> 41:21.391
Oh, lord, forgive Jose

41:22.146 --> 41:23.606
for he knows not what he does.

41:28.111 --> 41:32.121
It's too dark in here.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.825
Ma, leave it off.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.956
I am too old and blind
to be walking in the dark.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.460
What if I fall and break a hip?

41:39.706 --> 41:41.166
Who'll take care of me then, huh?

41:44.335 --> 41:46.085
I brought you some food.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.684
Jose had a chess game today

41:52.927 --> 41:54.677
and I don't think he did very good.

41:54.929 --> 41:58.599
Maybe you can talk to him
and cheer him up

41:58.850 --> 42:01.770
since I already tried.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.863
You know,
sometimes I wonder who died,

42:11.112 --> 42:12.782
you or Miguel.

42:14.157 --> 42:15.697
He was my son.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.700
Honey, what are you
talking about?

42:18.953 --> 42:22.923
I'm saying that he was my son.
He's not yours.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.496
I know, and he loved you
very much, Mija.

42:25.752 --> 42:27.952
He would light up every time
you would walk into a room.

42:32.759 --> 42:35.139
You know that he thanked me
before every game.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.136
He always thanked me.

42:37.388 --> 42:41.138
And may god bless
Miguelito for eternity.

42:41.392 --> 42:44.692
But, Mija,
what about your other son?

42:44.937 --> 42:47.857
- You were blessed to have two.
- He doesn't need me.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.147
You took him away from me
a long time ago

42:50.401 --> 42:52.781
- and you turned him against me.
- I did no such thing.

42:53.029 --> 42:54.798
You were always with Miguel
so I took care of Jose

42:54.822 --> 42:56.782
and I just taught him
how to play chess.

42:57.033 --> 43:00.873
Ma, who asked you
to teach him to play chess?

43:01.120 --> 43:02.960
- Who asked you?
- But he needed attention!

43:03.206 --> 43:04.326
- Attention?
- Yes!

43:04.582 --> 43:06.462
Mom, what the hell
do you know about attention?

43:06.709 --> 43:07.749
What do you know?

43:08.002 --> 43:10.283
Every time you and papa
went off to your chess tournaments

43:10.379 --> 43:13.719
and you left me alone,
I needed attention, too.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.046
- What do you know about that?
- What are you saying?

43:16.135 --> 43:20.055
I hate chess!
I didn't ask you to teach him chess!

43:20.306 --> 43:22.216
I can't deal with this!
I can't deal with this!

43:22.475 --> 43:24.765
I want you to get out of here. Go!

44:14.652 --> 44:15.652
Checkmate.

44:15.862 --> 44:17.022
- No, your time ran out.
- No.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.161
I checkmated you,
you can't move anywhere.

44:19.407 --> 44:20.676
- Anywhere in the square.
- Still, you ran out of time...

44:20.700 --> 44:23.910
- No. I won. I checkmated you.
- Dude, look at your time.

44:24.162 --> 44:26.252
No! You're cheating!

44:26.497 --> 44:29.117
- You're a liar!
- Hey!

44:31.294 --> 44:32.964
What is this?

44:34.881 --> 44:37.971
Put your hands on the seat.

44:38.217 --> 44:40.837
All of you,
put your hands on your seat.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.272
What happened to my soldiers?

44:49.854 --> 44:53.864
What happened to my knights?
What happened to my kings?

44:54.108 --> 44:55.648
You're acting like a bunch
of salvajes.

44:58.905 --> 45:00.945
You want to bring the violence?
Put it in the board.

45:04.911 --> 45:06.871
Because there are no lies
on the board.

45:07.121 --> 45:11.621
And just like in life,
every action has a consequence.

45:17.215 --> 45:18.545
Pick them up.

45:25.348 --> 45:26.748
I want everyone
to set up the board.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.306
Shake their hands.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.855
This is a battle of the will.

45:41.948 --> 45:42.948
Begin.

45:53.376 --> 45:55.626
<i>- At the park or at the beach...
- Check.</i>

45:55.878 --> 45:59.508
<i>At home or on TV,
nothing could go wrong</i>

45:59.757 --> 46:03.007
- <i>when you're with me...
- Check.</i>

46:03.261 --> 46:06.141
<i>Catch a ride or catch a wave</i>

46:06.389 --> 46:08.929
<i>at home or in la</i>

46:09.183 --> 46:10.943
<i>nothing could go wrong
when you're with me...</i>

46:10.977 --> 46:12.347
Checkmate.

46:13.604 --> 46:16.364
<i>When you're with me</i>

46:16.607 --> 46:18.727
<i>baby, baby, close your eyes</i>

46:18.985 --> 46:21.355
<i>baby, baby, don't think twice</i>

46:21.612 --> 46:26.112
<i>I want you, I want you</i>

46:26.993 --> 46:29.373
<i>baby, baby, don't think twice</i>

46:29.620 --> 46:34.120
<i>I want you, I want you</i>

46:34.792 --> 46:36.962
<i>I want you, want you,
want you, want you...</i>

46:37.211 --> 46:38.501
Guess who.

46:38.754 --> 46:40.554
- Not you.
- You sound worried.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.928
- I'm not.
- Well, neither am I.

46:43.175 --> 46:44.175
Good.

46:44.427 --> 46:46.177
I hope you've improved
since last time.

46:46.429 --> 46:49.559
- Whatever, homey.
- Fo' shizzle my nizzle, dawg.

46:49.807 --> 46:53.387
Let's get rolling, 'aight?

46:53.644 --> 46:55.354
My coach thinks
I have lots of potential.

46:55.604 --> 46:57.984
He thinks I'll be
in top ten next year.

46:58.232 --> 47:00.782
I'll have to travel
to New York for nationals.

47:01.027 --> 47:03.737
Times Square,
strawberry fields... forever.

47:03.988 --> 47:06.238
- Can you stop?
- All right, guys,

47:06.490 --> 47:08.468
we're ready to begin round three
of our regional tournament

47:08.492 --> 47:10.082
remember,
we are using USCF rules.

47:10.328 --> 47:12.118
If you touch a piece,
you must move it.

47:12.371 --> 47:14.711
Shake hands and begin.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.833
Check.

49:03.190 --> 49:05.190
Checkmate.

49:14.368 --> 49:15.538
Good game.

49:19.248 --> 49:20.918
What happened?

49:22.376 --> 49:23.376
I won.

49:26.172 --> 49:27.552
Did you take notation?

49:29.175 --> 49:30.925
- Mm-hmm.
- Eso.

49:33.387 --> 49:34.757
Check.

49:40.186 --> 49:41.436
Checkmate.

49:46.192 --> 49:47.742
What? Yes?

49:47.985 --> 49:50.145
<i>'</i> Yes!
<i>'</i> Yes!

49:50.404 --> 49:52.824
- Notation? Yes.
- Whoa, look at that... oh!

49:54.408 --> 49:55.408
Oh!

49:55.659 --> 49:57.179
Guys, do you think
they're going to fly us to Dallas

49:57.203 --> 49:58.597
- for the championship?
- If they do,

49:58.621 --> 50:00.101
you're going to have to
take a shower.

50:00.164 --> 50:01.374
- I don't stink.
- Yes, you do.

50:01.624 --> 50:04.794
Well, here, use this.
It works.

50:05.044 --> 50:07.554
Oh, dude!
You smell like a girl.

50:07.796 --> 50:10.376
Here. It works better
if you take it out of the box.

50:10.633 --> 50:13.643
It's true.

50:13.886 --> 50:16.966
I got a shower cap on my head

50:17.223 --> 50:18.313
- hey!
- Yep?

50:18.557 --> 50:19.757
Take the cap off and sit down.

50:22.937 --> 50:24.607
Shut up and sit down.

50:31.070 --> 50:32.860
- You think that was funny?
- It wasn't me.

50:33.113 --> 50:35.993
You find it very humorous?
Ls that funny, Jose? Was it you?

50:36.242 --> 50:40.042
Dani? Dani, isn't that where
your parents work?

50:45.042 --> 50:46.632
- Stop the bus.
- Dani, sit down.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.271
- Stop the bus. Stop!
- We can't stop the bus.

50:48.295 --> 50:51.005
- Sit down! Dani!
- Stop! Get out of the way!

50:51.257 --> 50:53.627
- Stop!
- We can't stop the bus!

50:53.884 --> 50:55.804
- What are you doing?
- Jose, what are you doing?

50:56.053 --> 50:57.893
- Jose!
- Stop the bus!

50:58.138 --> 51:00.888
- Stop the frigging bus!
- Dani!

51:01.141 --> 51:03.141
Open the door.

51:03.394 --> 51:05.524
I need to get to my mom.

51:05.771 --> 51:08.821
- No! Mom!
- Dani!

51:09.066 --> 51:10.776
Dani! Jose!

51:11.026 --> 51:15.446
Hey, Jose! Dani!

51:15.698 --> 51:18.118
- Jose! No, no, no, no.
- Dani!

51:18.367 --> 51:20.827
- Get out of here!
- Dani!

51:21.078 --> 51:22.328
No, no, no.
No, no. No, no.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.170
- We need you over here.
- Mom!

51:25.416 --> 51:26.416
- No!
- My mom!

51:26.625 --> 51:27.811
What are you doing,
Mr. Alvarado?

51:27.835 --> 51:29.455
No, no, no, no, no.

51:29.712 --> 51:31.962
- No, don't! Mr. Alvarado!
- There's nothing we can do.

51:32.214 --> 51:34.014
- Dani!
- In the Van. Get in the Van.

51:34.258 --> 51:37.088
- Don't go!
- Jose.

51:37.344 --> 51:39.554
- Dani!
- Get them in the Van now.

51:39.805 --> 51:41.465
Okay? Nothing you can do.

51:41.724 --> 51:44.184
Stay with me, all right?

52:19.762 --> 52:21.972
Do you want to go inside?
Your mom's probably worried.

52:22.222 --> 52:23.722
I don't care.

52:46.330 --> 52:47.830
No!

53:23.200 --> 53:25.040
<i>You lifted my chin</i>

53:25.285 --> 53:28.785
<i>brushed the hair from my face</i>

53:37.423 --> 53:38.883
I've never been good

53:39.133 --> 53:43.633
<i>at learning my place</i>

53:44.221 --> 53:46.391
<i>but all my thoughts escape</i>

53:46.640 --> 53:49.600
<i>when you whisper my name</i>

53:49.852 --> 53:53.402
<i>when you whisper my name</i>

53:53.647 --> 53:56.607
<i>when you bring me in</i>

53:56.859 --> 53:59.819
<i>when you hold me close</i>

54:00.070 --> 54:03.200
<i>all the trouble I've seen</i>

54:05.075 --> 54:09.575
<i>disappears into the night</i>

54:12.082 --> 54:16.212
<i>and I know the tighter
I hold onto you</i>

54:16.462 --> 54:20.962
<i>the more everything
will become right</i>

54:25.471 --> 54:28.851
<i>when you whisper my name</i>

54:41.695 --> 54:44.855
<i>stars seem to shine brighter</i>

54:45.115 --> 54:47.485
<i>when you're near</i>

54:48.702 --> 54:51.412
<i>and you see when I'm sad</i>

54:51.663 --> 54:54.463
<i>before I shed a tear...</i>

54:54.708 --> 54:57.088
Okay, we have to get started.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.125
Where's Jose?

55:01.298 --> 55:05.338
He's coming.
Set up your pieces.

55:05.594 --> 55:06.894
But we need him.

55:07.137 --> 55:11.137
Is she going to be okay,
Mr. Alvarado?

55:16.146 --> 55:19.186
Dani's tough,
and she's with her family.

55:19.441 --> 55:21.191
Hopefully, she'll be back.

55:25.155 --> 55:29.115
But listen, we didn't get
to this stage with one player.

55:31.328 --> 55:34.288
Come on, Brownsville brainiacs.

55:34.540 --> 55:36.940
Show me some of that attitude
you often torture me with, huh?

55:40.754 --> 55:42.674
I think it's time
for another speed drill.

55:42.923 --> 55:44.933
Start!

55:49.763 --> 55:52.723
We may have suffered a setback,

55:52.975 --> 55:54.555
but you kids have
what it takes to win.

55:54.810 --> 55:56.940
Hey, listen!

55:57.187 --> 55:59.147
Would I be investing
my rent money in you

55:59.398 --> 56:01.858
if I didn't think
you could do it?

56:02.109 --> 56:06.609
So, come on,
don't make me homeless.

56:22.004 --> 56:23.174
Crap.

56:29.595 --> 56:31.135
Hmm.

56:31.388 --> 56:34.138
You know,
locked away behind glass,

56:34.391 --> 56:37.561
it has an air of exclusivity.

56:37.811 --> 56:40.401
But it's not. It's inclusive.

56:40.647 --> 56:44.147
Everyone benefits.

56:44.401 --> 56:47.861
Wow. A chess title.
South Texas.

56:48.113 --> 56:51.533
Man, that's...
That's unprecedented territory.

56:51.783 --> 56:53.223
District's going to benefit from it.

56:53.410 --> 56:57.160
The community is hungry
for good news about these kids,

56:57.414 --> 56:59.574
and I really think that this
would be the perfect place

56:59.750 --> 57:04.170
to put the story...

57:04.421 --> 57:06.591
Right in the pantheon,
right here.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.180
What do you think?

57:09.426 --> 57:13.006
What do I think?

57:13.263 --> 57:14.683
Well, as you know, we lost Dani.

57:14.932 --> 57:17.392
Yeah.

57:17.643 --> 57:20.813
I just found out Peter
has no running water in his home,

57:21.063 --> 57:23.823
and Jose's headed down
a real bad alley.

57:27.861 --> 57:32.121
Did I mention that
I'm just about flat broke?

57:32.366 --> 57:34.906
I'm selling pickles to pay for gas.

57:36.745 --> 57:38.195
Well, you know what they say.

57:38.455 --> 57:41.575
The harder the battle,
the sweeter the victory.

57:45.671 --> 57:48.631
I'm not investing
my time and heart

57:48.882 --> 57:51.052
into these kids for a trophy.

57:51.301 --> 57:54.801
I'm doing it because chess...

57:55.055 --> 57:57.515
Might just be their chance
for a better life.

57:59.685 --> 58:01.645
That's what I want them
to champion.

58:04.314 --> 58:08.074
I'd like to believe once upon a time
you felt the same way.

58:10.112 --> 58:12.952
I'm sure it wasn't
because of the money.

58:13.198 --> 58:14.278
Am I right?

58:26.712 --> 58:27.752
Well...

58:32.092 --> 58:33.512
Listen, kid.

58:33.760 --> 58:36.970
Where you been, Flojo?

58:37.222 --> 58:39.892
I have a new setup to teach you.

58:40.142 --> 58:44.272
This one is with the queen
in defensive mode.

58:44.521 --> 58:47.021
- No, thanks, Abuelita.
- What's going on?

58:47.274 --> 58:49.904
How about if we practice

58:50.152 --> 58:51.992
the home away
from home technique?

58:52.237 --> 58:53.947
It's one of your favorites.

58:56.742 --> 59:00.542
- Dani's parents got arrested.
- What?

59:00.787 --> 59:02.907
Oh, my god.
That's terrible.

59:05.125 --> 59:06.285
What's going on?

59:10.464 --> 59:13.514
Hello?

59:13.759 --> 59:16.139
Dani's parents got arrested.

59:16.386 --> 59:19.756
I heard they were arresting people
at the factory. How's she doing?

59:20.015 --> 59:23.725
- She's gone.
- Oh.

59:24.770 --> 59:27.400
Well, I'm sure
you'll make other friends.

59:27.647 --> 59:29.857
- Dani was my best friend.
- I know, mijo,

59:30.108 --> 59:31.728
but what are you going to do?

59:31.985 --> 59:34.380
- She should be with her mother.
- You think kids are better off

59:34.404 --> 59:36.324
just because they're
with their mothers, like me?

59:36.573 --> 59:37.743
Like Miguel?

59:37.991 --> 59:39.581
Why are you talking to me like this?

59:39.826 --> 59:41.266
- You killed him!
- What did you say?

59:41.411 --> 59:43.011
You put pressure on Miguel
to be perfect.

59:43.205 --> 59:44.955
He told me.
It's your fault!

59:45.207 --> 59:46.767
You drive all the men
in your life away!

59:46.958 --> 59:49.338
Just like dad,
until he left us, too.

59:49.586 --> 59:52.336
- Shut up.
- Why?

59:52.589 --> 59:54.589
- Can't handle the truth?
- Jose!

59:54.841 --> 59:57.051
- Miguel was your only life.
- And you are hers, too.

59:57.302 --> 59:59.552
Mom! I can speak for myself.

59:59.805 --> 01:00:03.015
Then tell him.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.194
Oh, my god.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.065
Hi, Jose.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:12.776
What are you doing here, coach?

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.936
You are Jose's coach?

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.315
Yeah.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:19.175
Well, can't you see
that we're fighting here?

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:20.369
Yeah, the entire neighborhood

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.844
can hear that you guys
are fighting here.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.238
What do you want with my kid?

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:26.205
I just came to check up on him.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.856
Why don't you check on
the shitty attitude you helped create?

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.962
Is that what they're teaching him
at this school?

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.128
Between and my mother,
you ruined him.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.800
Excuse me, Mrs. Perez.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.300
Jose's a very decent

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:43.052
and very talented young man.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:45.599
Don't you see?

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:47.391
Miguel died.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.814
You lost a son,

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:53.273
but Jose has lost his brother
and his mother.

01:00:57.279 --> 01:00:58.819
If you'll allow me.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:03.027
Jose, can I please
talk to you outside?

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.864
I'm going to be straight with you.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.630
We have the state tournament
coming up.

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:23.888
On a personal level,

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:27.267
I feel horrible about what you kids
have to deal with.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:31.187
But we're a team,
and we worked so hard.

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:33.478
I can't do this without you.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.485
Every king needs his knight.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:42.453
What would Dani do?

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.870
What would Miguel do?

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:51.373
You dropped this on the bus.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:31.243
Mijo, no matter what you decide...

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.923
please, follow your heart.

01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:42.926
<i>It's not impossible
for me to cry</i>

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.506
- it's just...
- Okay.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:49.932
Bishop to e3.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:51.773
<i>But it's ingrained, you know</i>

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:56.728
<i>boys don't cry</i>

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:04.526
come on, Peter.
It's your move.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.161
Peter, come on, make a move.

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.538
I don't want to do this anymore.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.535
I don't want to wear
my crown and this robe

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:14.747
in the middle of the street
on my day off, but I am.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.340
Come on, be strategic.
Find the center.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:19.745
- <i>It's not impossible</i>
- <i>just move</i> a <i>piece.</i>

01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:22.755
<i>For me to cry, it's just...</i>

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:26.848
Susie!

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.965
<i>And it's a shame, you know</i>

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.642
- <i>but it's ingrained, you know...
- </i> Time <i>out.</i>

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.400
<i>- Boys will kick and scream...</i>

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.187
Cause a scene

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:42.571
<i>take your anger out
on someone else</i>

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:46.409
<i>steal their car, race their car</i>

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.196
<i>don't you dare</i>

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:49.580
<i>no, don't you dare cry...</i>

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.196
Mr. A., what are you doing?

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:57.575
Get back on your square
before you run out of time.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:01.424
And by the way, I was looking,
and you're toast.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.221
You're the king and you're not even
protecting yourself.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:07.216
How are you supposed to win
by making weak moves like that?

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.599
Tell me.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:13.806
- <i>Boys don't cry, boys don't cry...</i>
- <i>Make</i> a <i>move.</i>

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.439
Bishop, g7.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.595
<i>No, baby...</i>

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.904
Pawn to f3.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:23.028
<i>Boys don't cry, boys don't cry...</i>

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:24.646
Castle!

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:30.446
Queen, b2.
Find the center!

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.240
No, Mr. Alvarado.
Fight for the center.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:36.455
- Knight, c6.
- Yes.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:40.456
Castle.
You want to expose his queen.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.040
Expose their king.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.455
One of the strategies
is called the Ruy Lopez.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.594
You start off with your pawns,
and one's in front of the king.

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.612
You move that, and then you start off
moving one of your knights...

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:52.256
Any of your knights, okay?

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:56.564
If they use the Sicilian,
you got to use the Yugoslav attack.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.210
You're going to study the position,

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:00.021
study what kind of game he plays.

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:03.271
Strategize these movements, guys.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:06.355
That's an illegal touch move.
You always forget to say that.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:14.288
Let's hear it
for our amazing chess team.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:16.496
Come on!

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.656
Put it together.
There you go.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:22.075
Right on. Go team!

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:24.705
All right.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:28.255
We have to remember
that we're here today

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:32.138
to help sponsor their trip to Dallas
to play in this championship.

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.637
And I'm very thankful
for the parents

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.519
for bringing out
all the concessions.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:39.516
We got hot dogs
and pizza and tamales

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:40.899
and all kinds of good stuff,

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.516
so please gorge yourselves.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.112
Just get fat. It's okay,
because we need the money.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:49.148
We also have posters of the brilliant
Brownsville brainiacs.

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:51.534
If you buy it, they will sign it.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.911
And I'm also available
for photographs today.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.541
Come on!

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:01.118
Whew! Play on!

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.924
Yeah! Yeah!

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.089
Yeah!

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:14.354
- Hi, Abuelita.
- Hi, mijo.

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:17.505
No' no' no' no' no.

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:18.765
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.345
you have to eat something
before you go to sleep.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:23.153
Abuelita, I'm tired.

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:27.896
I know, but you need
energy to think.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.573
Without your brain,

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:32.569
the chessboard
becomes a storm at sea

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:37.322
with waves this high
that will swallow you up

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:42.170
if you don't eat my taquitos!

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:45.383
There you are.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.380
You know, you've been
working really hard.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:53.592
You remind me of your grandpa.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:59.178
He would play and play and...

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:02.812
We could watch his beard
grow over his mouth.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.402
<i>I...</i>

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:10.611
the taquitos warm enough, mijo?

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:16.616
Now you really remind me
of your grandpa.

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:30.802
Hey. Good morning.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:35.861
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to your school.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:39.425
Jerry asked me to work
an extra shift.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.177
He gave me overtime.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:46.850
I got you milk for your cereal.

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:52.532
Let me get a bowl, all right?

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:35.314
Not going to tear
that banner down, now, are you?

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:36.700
No.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.406
Oh, darn!

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:44.698
Feels good to be
part of a team, don't it?

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.962
Yeah.

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:52.094
- Good luck, Jose.
- Thank you.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.090
Yeah, brainiacs!

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:00.837
Go, brainiacs, go.

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:55.613
Your mom got called into work
at the last minute,

01:09:55.858 --> 01:10:00.148
but she told me to tell you
mucho good luck.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:02.365
Yeah.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:03.865
Don't forget your underwear.

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.367
I forgot mine on a trip
with your grandpa

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.779
and I ended up wearing his,
and they were not so clean.

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:10.873
All right, Abuelita.
I don't need to hear that.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:15.955
How long is your bus ride?

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.962
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours? Oh, my god.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.125
How can anyone ride a bus
for ten hours?

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:25.054
I have some hemorrhoid cream
just in case.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:27.684
Abuelita, I'm good down there.

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:29.312
You're good down there.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:31.813
God bless you!

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.981
I'll be praying for you.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:38.821
Blessed be the lord god almighty,
follow Jose in his journey...

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:42.856
Abuelita, Abuelita.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:47.414
I think you've blessed me enough
to last me 20 years.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:51.620
Oh, my love, not enough blessings
are enough for you.

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:53.923
I love you so much.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.428
Are you ready?

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:08.392
I wouldn't be so nervous
if Dani was here.

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:12.061
You'd be goofing off
and I'd be yelling at you two.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:19.938
Mr. A., do you think I'll ever
see her again?

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:24.029
If you want something bad enough,

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.450
it will always be within your reach.

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:28.079
Just like this tournament.

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:30.866
You really want to win this bad,
don't you?

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:43.877
<i>All my life</i>

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:46.893
<i>I want to be a firefly</i>

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.256
<i>burning bright through the night...</i>

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:51.314
Shooting for the moon

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:53.767
<i>with you there</i>

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.398
<i>flying through the midnight air</i>

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.686
<i>all the things that we could do</i>

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.900
<i>all the places we could share</i>

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:06.651
<i>where we're going,
we don't need a plan</i>

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:11.076
<i>hold it all in
the palm of our hand</i>

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.447
let's be more
than we've ever been

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:15.874
<i>the things we never do...</i>

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:20.003
Jose, take care of the fort.
I'll be right back, okay?

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.673
<i>Take a chance and jump right in...</i>

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.932
Hey, hi.
Brownsville brainiacs.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:30.095
<i>Here and now was made
for me and you</i>

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.466
let's be more
than we've ever been

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:35.023
<i>the things we never do...</i>

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.728
Let's get a couple games in.

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:39.519
Come on.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:43.282
<i>Here and now was made for me...</i>

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.316
<i>- Quick. Quick.
- And you...</i>

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:47.911
Don't block the doors, okay?

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.735
Okay.

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:53.042
I'm going to find out
what's next.

01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:10.337
<i>All the things that we could do</i>

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:15.095
<i>these days were made
for me and you</i>

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:19.311
<i>all the things that we could,
all the things that we could...</i>

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:24.062
<i>- You may begin.
- Baby, you and me could do</i>

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:26.683
<i>all the things that we could do</i>

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:33.615
<i>baby, you and me
could do, do, yeah</i>

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:35.998
let's be more
than we've ever <i>been...</i>

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.995
- Check.
- Check.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:43.168
<i>Right here, right now
was made for me and you</i>

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.589
<i>- take a chance, jump right in...
- Checkmate.</i>

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:48.168
<i>Do things we never do</i>

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:51.514
<i>here and now
was made for me and you...</i>

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.181
Checkmate.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.009
<i>Here and now was made</i>

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.925
<i>for me and you.</i>

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:01.015
- Next match?
- Yeah.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.690
Jose! OMG!

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:07.030
I heard about Dani.
I am so sorry. I feel so bad.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.486
And you, how are you doing?
Are you okay?

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:11.423
Have you been practicing?
Do you want some help?

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.617
Do you want some party mix?
They relax me.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.826
Whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:27.879
What are you looking at?

01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:31.224
- Nothing.
- Liar.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.257
You were checking out
that girl walking by.

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:35.641
- No, I wasn't.
- Are you leading me on?

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:38.348
Because I'm not going to be
the other woman.

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:40.929
I was just drinking water.

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:43.516
Boys!

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:48.444
- Girls!
- Boys. Girls!

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.147
Isn't this place a lot better
than last year's?

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:54.735
- I wouldn't know.
- This is your first time?

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.081
Yeah.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.511
Then this game
won't take very long.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.075
I won last year.

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:04.464
You may begin.

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:37.116
Check.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:48.344
Check.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:58.468
Checkmate.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.100
Good game.

01:16:02.349 --> 01:16:03.639
Punk.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:12.320
- Jose, study the notations.
- Here's his weak point.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.920
Try to get him
when he moves his king.

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:16.534
I'll be right back.
I need to see the team standings.

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.161
Keep working, keep working.

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:26.538
I'm not mad anymore.
I saw your last match.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:29.541
- You were great.
- I was just lucky.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:31.384
That was last year's champ.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:34.009
It's not realistic
to think it was luck.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.442
In fact, you turned
that game on him...

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:37.966
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:41.759
Why do you talk
so much and so fast?

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.774
Hello?
I'm a woman.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:47.187
That's what we do.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:51.766
That dude gives me the creeps.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:53.784
- Are you playing him?
- Yeah.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:56.356
You're toast.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:03.793
Hi, I'm Jose.
What's your name?

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:05.036
You don't know my name?

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:06.406
No.

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:08.384
You really do live
in the middle of nowhere.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:16.006
Not again.

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:17.507
Hi.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:20.588
I just want to say good luck.

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:23.005
You're Jacob, right?

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:24.854
Yeah.

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:28.389
You have really cute eyes.

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.024
Anything else?

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:42.236
Pretty, isn't she?

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.492
She's okay.

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:48.751
Dude, she's hot.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.246
Yeah.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.049
You may begin.

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:46.887
Check.

01:19:09.954 --> 01:19:11.124
Checkmate.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:13.418
What?

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:14.996
Checkmate.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.173
Enjoy it.
It won't last.

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:25.344
So how's the team doing?

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.644
I lost count.
The computer broke.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:29.678
But we're holding up.

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:32.522
Here are your chess notes
and your next opponent.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.058
Start studying, okay?

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:38.732
We need you to make
at least 5 out of 8 points.

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:43.151
The kid doesn't make mistakes.

01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:44.914
Thanks for that.

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:47.315
The computer's finally back up.

01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:49.954
We're still uploading scores,

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:51.802
but we believe the points
from this match

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.956
will determine the team champion.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:55.326
Do all of you understand?

01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:56.792
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.172
- Good.
- All right.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:19:59.499
Come on, Jose.

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:23.572
I heard you're pretty good.

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:28.743
Your coach told you
to ignore me, didn't he?

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:33.644
My coach thinks
you're going to win.

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:36.786
- Can you believe that?
- Of course, I do.

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:41.804
You know, my best friend Dani
was supposed to be here.

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.586
She would do anything in her power
to take you down.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.680
Well, since she's not here,

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:49.335
I'll do it for her.

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:53.264
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:54.524
yo" may begin.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.771
Don't take that move.

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:54.594
Check.

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:18.792
Checkmate.

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:27.838
Good game.

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.410
That's okay.
Your points were good.

01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:04.412
- We still have a chance.
- Thanks.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:09.794
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:12.423
there was slight delay
with the results

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:15.803
of some of the final scores.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.641
We have our winning teams.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:23.387
Starting with the middle school
Texas state champion...

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:27.017
Congratulations goes to...

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:29.981
The Brownsville brainiacs.

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:31.992
What? Come on, man.
You got to be kidding me.

01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:34.462
- There's got to be some mistake.
- Stand back.

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:35.672
No, what kind of operation
are you running here?

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.026
Stand back.

01:24:37.281 --> 01:24:41.781
And the high school
state champion, Dallas east.

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:45.245
Congratulations to everybody.

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:47.367
This has been
a fantastic tournament.

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:49.464
Good job, guys.
Good job.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:08.481
Jose! Jose!

01:25:15.736 --> 01:25:17.446
Abuelita,
what are you doing here?

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:18.881
I thought you couldn't make it.

01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:21.905
You're kidding.
No way!

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:26.285
But how'd you make it here?

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:29.078
Well...

01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:32.503
<i>I sit there in my cubicle
in the morning</i>

01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:35.883
<i>I</i> can hardly wait
to Google you today

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:39.721
<i>but nothing every comes up,
it gets boring</i>

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:43.298
<i>but I'll find you,
yeah, I'll find you</i>

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:46.515
<i>I miss you so much that it hurts...</i>

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:50.017
I love you so much.

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.650
<i>But I know where you'll be</i>

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:56.738
<i>after work...</i>

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.695
You did so good.

01:25:58.945 --> 01:26:00.065
<i>You're the star in my sky...</i>

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.315
How'd you learn to play like that?

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:03.744
- From grandma.
- Yeah?

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.542
- Can you teach me?
- I will.

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:08.327
<i>On the fourth of July</i>

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.670
<i>you make me sing,
you make me sing</i>

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:11.956
<i>oh, oh, oh, oh...</i>

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:14.289
Brainiacs! Brainiacs!

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:17.920
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:20.053
<i>sometimes I feel like</i>

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.180
<i>when I hold my breath
and count to ten...</i>

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:24.717
- Okay, what's your next move?
- Be right there with <i>me...</i>

01:26:24.971 --> 01:26:27.181
I do remember this.

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:29.562
<i>All my stars
are floating overhead</i>

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:33.360
'cause <i>I</i> passed out again...

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:35.765
You can't do that!

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:38.284
When do I get to use this?

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:40.777
- Are you thirsty, mijo?
- Yes, please.

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.229
<i>You're like a sunny delight...</i>

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:43.591
Show me the home away from home.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:44.615
All right.

01:26:44.825 --> 01:26:46.010
The most powerful piece
is the queen.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.584
You don't want to lose her.

01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:49.408
<i>You're the star in my sky</i>

01:26:49.663 --> 01:26:51.163
<i>you're the wink in my eye</i>

01:26:51.415 --> 01:26:52.745
<i>you make me feel like a kid</i>

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.579
<i>that heard the ice cream truck</i>

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.955
<i>you're like a sunny delight
on the fourth of July</i>

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.173
<i>you make me sing,
you make me sing...</i>

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:15.109
<i>I'll find you...</i>

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.050
Let's enjoy life.
