WEBVTT

00:00.350 --> 00:01.870
So have you picked a place yet?

00:01.871 --> 00:03.828
I'd love to do it at
the Botanical Gardens,

00:03.828 --> 00:05.697
but Chris thinks
it's too expensive.

00:05.698 --> 00:06.901
It's your wedding.

00:06.902 --> 00:08.230
It's supposed to cost a fortune.

00:08.231 --> 00:10.427
I know.
You only get married once.

00:13.859 --> 00:16.230
- Aah! Oh, my God!
- Somebody call 9-1-1!

00:16.231 --> 00:17.764
Help! Please.

00:17.765 --> 00:20.073
Somebody, help! Help!

00:20.074 --> 00:21.377
I'll call you later. Bye.

00:21.378 --> 00:22.395
Who was that?

00:22.396 --> 00:23.485
Personal business, Castle.

00:23.486 --> 00:25.658
Really? Who is it?
Inquiring minds want to know.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.459
Yeah, well, if you must
know, his name is Roger.

00:28.460 --> 00:29.780
Roger.

00:29.781 --> 00:30.690
Don't make fun.

00:30.691 --> 00:32.259
Do you know what he has
that few men have?

00:32.261 --> 00:34.760
A Josh Groban CD?
Uh, Hummel figurines?

00:34.761 --> 00:36.013
No, not even close.

00:36.014 --> 00:41.120
Roger has the most
incredible resistance band.

00:41.121 --> 00:41.931
A resistance band?

00:41.932 --> 00:43.477
What is that?
Is that what I think it is?

00:43.478 --> 00:45.445
For strength training.
He's my physical therapist.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.681
Oh. Oh, I had no idea
you were still going.

00:47.682 --> 00:50.116
Yeah, for another few
weeks, till I get 100%.

00:50.195 --> 00:51.541
- Hey, good morning.
- Morning.

00:51.542 --> 00:52.176
So what do we got?

00:52.177 --> 00:53.970
Victim's name is Sarah Vasquez.

00:54.144 --> 00:56.203
She's a 28-year-old
kindergarten teacher.

00:56.626 --> 00:58.330
She and a classmate were
leaving this yoga studio

00:58.331 --> 00:59.725
when Sarah suddenly dropped.

01:00.692 --> 01:02.365
Bullet wound straight
to the heart.

01:02.728 --> 01:04.181
Yeah, what's weird is,
no one heard a shot

01:04.182 --> 01:05.394
or saw a shooter.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.246
Maybe the weapon was silenced.

01:08.247 --> 01:09.781
Maybe it was a stray bullet.

01:09.839 --> 01:10.687
Just read an article,

01:10.688 --> 01:12.572
how a mailman in
Portland was killed

01:12.573 --> 01:14.161
when a bullet fired into the air

01:14.162 --> 01:16.229
six blocks away
fell back to earth.

01:16.650 --> 01:18.610
This bullet didn't
just drop from the sky

01:18.611 --> 01:19.984
and hit Sarah Vasquez.

01:20.464 --> 01:21.442
Angle's wrong.

01:21.443 --> 01:23.291
It went through her
from front to back,

01:23.292 --> 01:24.505
not from up to down.

01:24.506 --> 01:25.668
Can you tell us point of origin?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.142
Not until I do a full exam.

01:27.143 --> 01:28.682
Was yoga a regular
thing for Sarah?

01:28.683 --> 01:30.126
Tuesdays and Thursdays
at 7:00 A.M.,

01:30.127 --> 01:31.210
before school started.

01:31.211 --> 01:32.323
Okay, let's look into enemies

01:32.324 --> 01:34.101
- and anyone that knew she was here.
- Right.

01:39.659 --> 01:41.457
We just got engaged last month.

01:42.872 --> 01:44.858
She was so excited about
planning the wedding.

01:45.652 --> 01:47.870
Chris, was there anyone that
might have wanted to hurt Sarah?

01:48.210 --> 01:49.104
No.

01:49.496 --> 01:51.542
Maybe an old boyfriend who
was upset about the wedding?

01:51.923 --> 01:53.499
She didn't have anyone
like that in her life.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.215
Everyone loved Sarah.

01:56.097 --> 01:59.500
Wait. She did mention something
last night about a guy.

02:00.223 --> 02:01.096
Someone she knew?

02:01.097 --> 02:02.351
No. Uh...

02:03.053 --> 02:05.338
she said she saw him a few
days ago, outside the school.

02:05.339 --> 02:06.765
And then Tuesday
morning, she said

02:06.766 --> 02:08.402
she thought she saw him
when she got out of yoga.

02:08.404 --> 02:09.851
Did she tell you
what he looked like?

02:10.975 --> 02:12.911
I-I-I can't remember. I...

02:14.539 --> 02:16.624
Looks like Sarah's yoga
routine was common knowledge.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.822
She even posted about it
on Facebook, joked that

02:18.823 --> 02:20.738
she was gonna fit into that
dress if it killed her.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.236
Well, somebody was
following her,

02:22.237 --> 02:23.810
so let's talk to her
friends and coworkers...

02:23.811 --> 02:25.582
and see if they saw a
strange man hanging around.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.314
On it.

02:26.987 --> 02:27.878
Beckett.

02:28.130 --> 02:29.013
Lanie's got something.

02:29.014 --> 02:29.977
You should get down here.

02:30.346 --> 02:33.251
The bullet that killed
Sarah Vasquez is a .308,

02:33.252 --> 02:36.704
specifically a 168 Grain
Sierra Matchking.

02:36.705 --> 02:37.797
A rifle bullet.

02:37.798 --> 02:40.254
It's a common ammunition
favored by...

02:41.358 --> 02:42.864
long-range shooters.

02:45.516 --> 02:46.915
So she was shot from a distance?

02:46.916 --> 02:49.998
Based on her wound and how deep
it went into the door frame,

02:49.999 --> 02:51.924
I'd say the bullet was fired

02:51.925 --> 02:54.753
between 200 and 300 yards away.

02:54.754 --> 02:55.937
200 yards?

02:55.938 --> 02:58.546
Do we have any idea
where from exactly?

02:58.547 --> 02:59.589
We're canvassing.

02:59.590 --> 03:01.055
Near as we can figure...

03:01.056 --> 03:03.797
the shooter fired from
one of these buildings,

03:03.798 --> 03:05.633
somewhere between the
10th and 15th floor.

03:05.634 --> 03:08.853
You guys, you don't have to
avoid the word on my account.

03:11.294 --> 03:12.710
- What word?
- Sniper.

03:12.711 --> 03:13.975
Even I noticed.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.033
- We weren't avoiding anything.
- It was her idea. She--

03:16.034 --> 03:17.650
Look, guys, I'm a big girl.

03:17.651 --> 03:19.728
So let's just cut to the chase.
How good is this guy?

03:19.729 --> 03:22.827
Well, he's as good as any
of the shooter--snipers

03:22.828 --> 03:23.830
in my unit.

03:23.831 --> 03:26.551
He took out a moving target
from a quarter of a mile away.

03:26.882 --> 03:27.996
Did she feel it?

03:28.638 --> 03:30.465
No. She died instantly.

03:32.281 --> 03:33.716
So then I guess the question is,

03:33.717 --> 03:35.557
why did our sniper target Sarah?

03:35.558 --> 03:37.896
Any leads on the guy that
she said was following her?

03:37.897 --> 03:39.802
No one in her circle
remembers seeing the guy,

03:39.803 --> 03:42.231
and she didn't mention him
to anyone but her fiance.

03:42.232 --> 03:43.897
Maybe he didn't have
anything to do with it.

03:43.935 --> 03:44.561
What do you mean?

03:44.562 --> 03:47.248
Well, usually we find our
killers by knowing our victims,

03:47.249 --> 03:48.223
finding a motive.

03:48.224 --> 03:49.780
But what if there isn't one?

03:51.413 --> 03:53.943
What if she was shot at random?
How do we find him then?

Beckett's down!

04:43.310 --> 04:48.787
Sync by YYeTs, corrections by Alex1969
www.addic7ed.com

04:51.072 --> 04:53.447
Victim is Henry Wyatt,
38-year-old attorney.

04:53.448 --> 04:55.192
- Same shooter?
- Looks that way.

04:57.888 --> 04:59.291
Anyone, uh, see
or hear anything?

04:59.292 --> 05:01.832
Nada, just like before.
He went for the head this time.

05:01.833 --> 05:02.988
He's getting more confident.

05:02.989 --> 05:04.706
Another victim,
same time of day--

05:05.099 --> 05:07.214
this could be the DC
sniper all over again.

05:10.796 --> 05:11.638
Lanie, is that the slug?

05:11.639 --> 05:13.840
Yeah, it's all banged
up from the concrete,

05:13.841 --> 05:15.565
but it looks like
the same caliber.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.697
The angle of the entry's
more extreme, though.

05:17.698 --> 05:19.143
He shot Wyatt from higher up.

05:22.505 --> 05:23.438
See something?

05:26.067 --> 05:27.251
Beckett, you all right?

05:28.033 --> 05:30.051
Yeah, I'm just, uh...
I-I'm just trying to figure out

05:30.052 --> 05:32.131
why these two victims and--and...

05:32.531 --> 05:33.514
why shoot here?

05:33.906 --> 05:36.170
The victims might be random,
but the location isn't.

05:36.522 --> 05:38.150
A pro recons his
target beforehand.

05:38.151 --> 05:39.953
If you're gonna kill something
from a long distance,

05:39.954 --> 05:41.235
it's not a point-and-shoot
activity.

05:41.236 --> 05:44.168
You factor in all the conditions,
like range to target,

05:45.277 --> 05:46.912
minute of arc, and...

05:47.562 --> 05:48.706
windage.

05:50.757 --> 05:51.659
What is it?

05:52.754 --> 05:53.696
This flag...

05:54.010 --> 05:55.833
is the perfect wind gauge.

05:56.705 --> 05:58.008
That can't be a coincidence.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.491
Okay, so if he hung
that up there,

05:59.492 --> 06:01.057
we might be able to
get eyes on him.

06:01.058 --> 06:03.201
We should canvass the area
for security cameras--

06:12.879 --> 06:14.080
We have a gunman

06:14.081 --> 06:18.203
terrorizing this city--
2 victims in 24 hours.

06:18.204 --> 06:21.071
We don't know who he is or
why he shot those folks.

06:21.072 --> 06:23.038
Detective Ryan, what do we
know about the second victim?

06:23.039 --> 06:25.458
Henry Wyatt was a litigation
partner at a law firm

06:25.459 --> 06:26.895
two blocks from
where he was shot,

06:26.896 --> 06:27.999
and according to his secretary,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.965
he liked to walk,
which means there was

06:29.966 --> 06:32.375
a predictable routine,
just like Sarah Vasquez.

06:32.376 --> 06:33.880
Which doesn't mean
they were targeted.

06:34.023 --> 06:36.571
After all, most New
Yorkers follow routines.

06:36.922 --> 06:37.679
Esposito...

06:37.680 --> 06:39.534
have we learned where
they were shot from?

06:39.535 --> 06:40.804
We've got teams sweeping

06:40.805 --> 06:42.235
buildings near
both crime scenes,

06:42.236 --> 06:43.630
and so far, we've come up empty.

06:44.001 --> 06:45.454
We need to find our shooter...

06:45.455 --> 06:46.880
You know, it's just
a startle response.

06:46.881 --> 06:49.079
- It could happen to anyone.
- Yeah, well, I'm not anyone.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.147
- No, I'm just sayin'.
- Just don't.

06:52.593 --> 06:53.646
Detective Beckett...

06:53.647 --> 06:55.762
where are we on Henry
Wyatt and Sarah Vasquez?

06:55.763 --> 06:56.615
I'm sorry?

06:56.616 --> 06:58.705
On links between the victims?

07:00.068 --> 07:02.115
We're still checking,
but they don't live

07:02.116 --> 07:03.771
or work in the same area,

07:03.772 --> 07:06.612
and it doesn't seem like
they have anyone in common.

07:06.613 --> 07:09.135
In fact, we haven't really
found any connections

07:09.136 --> 07:10.377
between the two of them yet.

07:10.378 --> 07:11.400
Well, keep looking.

07:11.401 --> 07:14.470
We know he has training,
a specific skill set.

07:14.471 --> 07:16.929
Now every branch in the
military has snipers...

07:16.930 --> 07:18.676
so do law enforcement agencies.

07:18.677 --> 07:19.880
We're talking about close to

07:19.881 --> 07:21.215
a thousand qualified shooters.

07:21.216 --> 07:25.689
The fact is, everyone in this
city is a potential target.

07:25.690 --> 07:27.497
Let's get it done, people.

07:31.923 --> 07:32.934
Wait. Where you going?

07:33.275 --> 07:34.670
I-I just have to
go do something.

07:35.276 --> 07:36.196
Hey, Beckett,

07:36.197 --> 07:37.600
canvass turned up
a security camera

07:37.601 --> 07:38.821
across from where
the flag was hung.

07:38.822 --> 07:40.207
Footage is on its
way in right now.

07:45.575 --> 07:46.456
Is she okay?

07:48.203 --> 07:49.769
No. You don't understand.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.278
I need to be okay.

07:52.498 --> 07:54.245
That's not always
a choice, Kate.

07:54.687 --> 07:57.987
What you're describing, a
hypervigilance, it's a classic

07:57.988 --> 08:01.331
- symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder.
- I don't have PTSD.

08:01.332 --> 08:03.428
You were shot by a sniper.

08:03.429 --> 08:04.585
I think it's fair to say,

08:04.586 --> 08:06.722
this case is going
to bring up issues,

08:06.723 --> 08:09.055
- issues you still haven't dealt with.
- Okay, then fine.

08:09.056 --> 08:09.891
I'll deal with them.

08:09.892 --> 08:12.792
Right now I need to figure
out how to make this stop.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.321
It's not going to stop,

08:15.194 --> 08:17.270
not without time and treatment.

08:17.271 --> 08:19.833
The psychological trauma
is every bit as real

08:19.834 --> 08:21.410
as the physical trauma.

08:21.842 --> 08:23.650
Listen, people are
dying out there.

08:24.053 --> 08:26.389
I don't have time to get all
weepy over a couple of scars.

08:26.390 --> 08:28.820
Okay. So what's the alternative,

08:29.921 --> 08:33.013
walking around feeling like you
have crosshairs on your back,

08:33.414 --> 08:36.022
thinking every glint off a
window is a sniper's scope?

08:36.023 --> 08:38.446
Look, there's gotta be a pill
out there or something, right?

08:38.447 --> 08:40.082
Something to take the edge off.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.995
Medication can help...

08:42.839 --> 08:44.442
- but not right away.
- Well, then what?

08:44.823 --> 08:46.088
Well, for one,

08:46.497 --> 08:48.958
I think you should consider
stepping away from the case.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.365
You don't think I
can handle this?

08:51.366 --> 08:52.390
I'm saying...

08:52.391 --> 08:53.876
you don't have to.

08:54.259 --> 08:56.376
You're not the only cop
in the city, Kate.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.508
Okay.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.072
Then you know what?

09:05.187 --> 09:06.121
I'm fine.

09:07.244 --> 09:08.187
Thank you.

09:10.786 --> 09:12.493
How worried should I
be about Beckett?

09:12.494 --> 09:14.702
She's never snapped at
me like that before.

09:16.000 --> 09:16.793
And meant it.

09:16.794 --> 09:17.960
Hell, it was bad for
me when I came back,

09:17.961 --> 09:19.073
and I never took a bullet.

09:19.074 --> 09:20.093
Well, at least she
doesn't remember it.

09:20.094 --> 09:21.668
Or she doesn't want to remember.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.930
A thing like that, it's
easier to just keep in a box.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.509
But this case might
bust that box open.

09:27.931 --> 09:28.762
So what can we do?

09:28.763 --> 09:30.387
- Catch the shooter.
- He's right.

09:30.388 --> 09:32.666
Best thing for everyone,
Beckett included.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.051
In the meantime,
just give her space

09:34.052 --> 09:35.304
and don't take it personally.

09:39.477 --> 09:40.772
Hey, guys, check this out.

09:41.273 --> 09:42.849
This is 2 days ago at 4:30 P.M.

09:45.488 --> 09:47.836
He planted the flag.
He's gotta be our shooter.

09:48.579 --> 09:49.621
He knows where the camera is.

09:49.622 --> 09:50.757
That's why he keeps
his face covered.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.963
Why choose this street?

09:51.964 --> 09:53.839
Why not pick a place without
any security cameras?

09:53.840 --> 09:55.765
'Cause he's straight
up taunting us.

10:00.490 --> 10:02.670
I'll run this photo by victims'
coworkers and friends,

10:02.671 --> 10:04.354
see if anyone recognizes him.

10:04.494 --> 10:06.216
He is not gonna make it easy
for us to catch him, is he?

10:06.906 --> 10:09.601
No. He's smart and he's patient.

10:09.671 --> 10:11.331
That's part of a sniper's DNA.

10:11.623 --> 10:12.577
Yeah.

10:13.241 --> 10:14.141
Don't go in.

10:14.142 --> 10:15.963
Call CSU.
I'll be there in ten.

10:16.405 --> 10:18.901
Uniform just found where the
sniper shot Henry Wyatt from.

10:28.897 --> 10:29.888
Yep.

10:31.018 --> 10:32.289
There's the crime scene.

10:35.536 --> 10:36.642
600 yards.

10:36.643 --> 10:38.030
World-class shot.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.548
- But it's all wrong.
- What do you mean?

10:40.549 --> 10:43.364
The view of the kill zone is
partially obstructed by that tree.

10:43.373 --> 10:45.058
A better shot would've
been from the roof.

10:45.088 --> 10:46.367
Our boy would know that.

10:46.368 --> 10:48.124
So why wouldn't he take
the shot from up there?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.370
It's possible he was
worried about being seen

10:49.371 --> 10:52.428
by someone in a taller building
or a passing helicopter.

10:56.792 --> 10:57.691
What's that?

10:57.692 --> 10:58.894
A paper doll.

10:58.895 --> 11:00.551
Think maybe it was
left by the sniper?

11:00.785 --> 11:01.754
Or...

11:02.110 --> 11:04.014
one of the workmen's kids.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.328
So the sniper took the
shot from this window.

11:07.329 --> 11:08.267
No.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.570
He would've wanted to be
invisible from the street.

11:10.571 --> 11:12.384
He'd have taken the shot from...

11:12.588 --> 11:13.749
right here.

11:16.530 --> 11:17.722
He took his time...

11:18.670 --> 11:20.205
to spot that flag.

11:22.206 --> 11:23.644
Adjusted for wind.

11:24.615 --> 11:26.243
Acquired his target.

11:27.384 --> 11:28.438
Bam.

11:29.619 --> 11:30.665
The shell casing.

11:30.666 --> 11:32.409
It would've ejected
to the right.

12:03.666 --> 12:04.617
Sorry.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.983
Hey. Where have you been?
I called you.

12:08.052 --> 12:10.125
Uh, yeah, my phone's off.
What's--what's up?

12:10.126 --> 12:12.575
Shell casing from the Wyatt
sniper hide had a print on it.

12:12.576 --> 12:14.472
We just matched it to a
former special forces sniper

12:14.473 --> 12:15.549
named Marcus Ford.

12:15.550 --> 12:16.724
Just went through a
bitter divorce--

12:16.725 --> 12:18.465
textbook trigger for
that kind of violence.

12:18.466 --> 12:20.401
Ford runs a shooting
range in Long Island.

12:20.402 --> 12:21.930
State police have
a tactical team

12:21.931 --> 12:23.647
on the way to meet us there now.

12:27.383 --> 12:28.490
Uh, maybe, uh,

12:28.491 --> 12:29.993
it would be a good idea
if we hung back here?

12:29.994 --> 12:33.020
We'll study up on Ford, just
prep for the interrogation.

12:33.021 --> 12:34.933
Yeah, that's a good idea.
We got it covered.

12:35.191 --> 12:36.269
Yeah, okay.

12:39.616 --> 12:40.591
Thank you.

12:43.144 --> 12:45.049
Our officers found
a whole arsenal

12:45.050 --> 12:47.205
at your shooting range,
Mr. Ford.

12:47.206 --> 12:48.029
Last time I checked,

12:48.030 --> 12:49.423
I still have the
right to bear arms.

12:49.424 --> 12:50.777
Yeah, well, you should
know that ballistics

12:50.778 --> 12:52.012
is testing your rifles.

12:52.013 --> 12:54.441
Have at it.
I didn't shoot anyone.

12:54.442 --> 12:56.382
Well, that's not
exactly true, is it?

12:56.915 --> 12:58.705
According to your
military record,

12:58.706 --> 13:01.706
- you have 92 confirmed kills.
- So?

13:01.707 --> 13:03.764
You lookin' to make
it an even hundred?

13:03.809 --> 13:05.699
What's it like to look
through the scope,

13:05.700 --> 13:07.535
to play God?

13:07.536 --> 13:08.997
How do you feel when
you pull that trigger

13:08.998 --> 13:10.961
and you destroy someone's life?

13:10.962 --> 13:13.287
It's none of your damn
business is how it feels.

13:13.288 --> 13:13.803
You know what I think?

13:13.804 --> 13:16.422
I think that you should be on
the other side of that barrel.

13:16.423 --> 13:18.185
Is that a threat?
Are you threatening me?

13:18.186 --> 13:20.977
What are those people?
Are they just paper targets to you?

13:20.978 --> 13:24.609
Do you even think about the
pain that you've caused,

13:24.610 --> 13:27.082
about the families
that you leave behind?

13:27.083 --> 13:29.594
Every life I ever took
saved one of ours!

13:29.595 --> 13:31.810
Like hell it did!
You know what I think?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.458
I think that you liked it.

13:34.570 --> 13:36.461
I think that you couldn't
wait to kill again.

13:36.462 --> 13:37.604
You're outta your mind, lady.

13:37.605 --> 13:40.601
We found your print on a shell
casing left by the sniper.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.205
That's impossible.

13:41.206 --> 13:43.290
That is a lie.

13:43.734 --> 13:45.447
I have nothing left to say.

13:46.315 --> 13:47.852
I know my rights.

13:50.816 --> 13:52.269
None of Ford's weapons
are a match.

13:52.270 --> 13:54.299
So? That doesn't mean
he's not the sniper.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.600
He could've hidden the rifle.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.170
Ford's not our man.

13:57.251 --> 13:59.473
His alibis for both
shootings are solid.

13:59.474 --> 14:00.534
Are you sure?

14:00.535 --> 14:02.896
I think I know how to check
an alibi, detective.

14:02.897 --> 14:03.854
Well, if he's not our man,

14:03.855 --> 14:06.190
how the hell did his fingerprint
get on that shell casing?

14:06.191 --> 14:07.364
Could be a reload.

14:07.365 --> 14:08.751
It's easy enough to
load a new bullet

14:08.752 --> 14:10.542
into an empty shell casing
like the one we found.

14:10.543 --> 14:11.732
All you need is the
right equipment.

14:11.733 --> 14:12.646
Which means our sniper

14:12.647 --> 14:14.163
is a client at Ford's
shooting range.

14:14.164 --> 14:16.952
Go back in there
and get his help.

14:19.585 --> 14:20.901
He's not gonna
want to talk to us

14:20.902 --> 14:22.104
after the way you
went after him.

14:22.105 --> 14:23.868
So what are you trying to
say, that I screwed up?

14:23.869 --> 14:24.468
No, um--

14:24.469 --> 14:26.059
I think what he's saying is that

14:26.060 --> 14:27.325
you played bad cop.

14:27.454 --> 14:28.426
And now we'll get
more out of Ford

14:28.427 --> 14:30.103
if I go in and play good cop.

14:35.534 --> 14:36.614
Okay, fine.

14:39.790 --> 14:42.066
Maybe Ford can get us what
we need to nail this guy.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.819
Mr. Ford, my apologies.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.385
Gun!

15:05.886 --> 15:06.905
Kate!

15:08.690 --> 15:09.665
Beckett.

15:10.703 --> 15:11.637
Coffee?

15:12.597 --> 15:13.996
No. No, thanks.

15:14.452 --> 15:16.161
It's decaf. Look--

15:16.162 --> 15:17.112
Castle, I'm fine.

15:17.113 --> 15:18.248
- Right, but--
- No, really.

15:18.249 --> 15:19.974
I'm fine. What's in the folder?

15:20.479 --> 15:22.423
CSU report on the paper doll.

15:22.424 --> 15:24.241
This was not made by a kid.

15:24.242 --> 15:27.195
It was cut out very precisely
with an X-Acto knife.

15:27.543 --> 15:28.954
Out of what, a magazine?

15:28.955 --> 15:30.280
No, the paper stock
is too heavy,

15:30.281 --> 15:32.184
and given there's nothing
printed on the back,

15:32.185 --> 15:35.265
it's probably from some high-end
coffee table book of some kind.

15:35.266 --> 15:37.059
My guess-- a book of paintings.

15:37.060 --> 15:39.039
If you look closely, you
can see brush strokes.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.789
I think the sniper left that.

15:40.997 --> 15:42.165
Why would he do that?

15:42.166 --> 15:43.289
That much I don't know.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.205
Yo.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.016
Marcus Ford was no help.

15:46.017 --> 15:47.298
He couldn't ID
the guy in the video.

15:47.299 --> 15:48.321
We're pulling his
credit card receipts,

15:48.322 --> 15:51.023
but he says that the shooting
range is mostly a cash business.

15:53.015 --> 15:53.967
Beckett.

15:54.762 --> 15:55.681
Where?

15:56.806 --> 15:58.014
Okay. We're on our way.

15:58.683 --> 15:59.476
Ryan found the building

15:59.477 --> 16:01.899
the sniper shot
Sarah Vasquez from.

16:05.148 --> 16:06.934
The super recognized the
jacket from the photo,

16:06.935 --> 16:08.905
said he'd been hanging
around the building.

16:09.666 --> 16:11.093
How do we know he
was in this room?

16:11.094 --> 16:13.105
Because we found
another one of these.

16:14.946 --> 16:17.653
This is it. He shot Sarah
Vasquez from right here.

16:18.693 --> 16:20.055
This is different
from the first one.

16:20.056 --> 16:21.749
It must be from a
different painting.

16:21.750 --> 16:22.940
They've gotta mean something.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.814
Yeah, like what?
What's it possibly gonna mean?

16:24.815 --> 16:26.373
I don't know, but he's
leaving 'em for a reason.

16:26.374 --> 16:27.872
Yeah, he's screwing with us.

16:27.873 --> 16:30.824
He's just taunting us and trying
to make us look like idiots.

16:33.959 --> 16:34.893
Hey.

16:35.436 --> 16:37.038
We'll figure it out, okay?

16:39.956 --> 16:40.987
Found something.

16:41.946 --> 16:42.964
Moleskin.

16:42.965 --> 16:44.232
Hard-core military
snipers put it

16:44.233 --> 16:45.999
on the stocks of their
weapons to absorb sweat

16:46.000 --> 16:47.550
so their rifles don't slip.

16:47.613 --> 16:49.306
If there's sweat,
we can get DNA.

16:49.307 --> 16:50.237
Yeah.

16:50.393 --> 16:51.411
All right, go.

16:55.416 --> 16:57.018
This is where it all started.

16:57.487 --> 16:59.618
He pulled that trigger
right in this room.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.040
One second, Sarah
Vasquez is alive

17:04.040 --> 17:06.214
and dreaming of the
perfect wedding,

17:07.228 --> 17:08.540
and then she isn't.

17:11.604 --> 17:12.619
Kate...

17:12.760 --> 17:14.813
You know he saw her face
when he killed her?

17:15.092 --> 17:15.791
People always think

17:15.792 --> 17:19.339
that snipers are so removed
from their targets.

17:19.467 --> 17:21.679
But he wasn't.
He is as close as we are right now,

17:21.680 --> 17:23.152
looking through that scope.

17:23.153 --> 17:24.684
We're gonna catch this guy.

17:25.217 --> 17:27.887
Yeah. Like we caught
the guy that shot me.

17:52.021 --> 17:53.066
Why me?

18:02.763 --> 18:03.948
Oh, darling.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.760
I hope you haven't
been up all night.

18:05.761 --> 18:07.048
Ah, I couldn't sleep.

18:07.049 --> 18:08.896
Two days, two people dead--

18:08.897 --> 18:10.962
someone out there is waking up

18:10.963 --> 18:12.905
not knowing they're gonna
be murder number three.

18:12.906 --> 18:15.681
I think I just decided
to skip school today.

18:15.682 --> 18:16.640
Actually, I think you're both

18:16.641 --> 18:18.728
under house arrest until
we catch this guy.

18:18.729 --> 18:20.600
Oh, I can only imagine
how this sniper

18:20.601 --> 18:22.191
must be affecting Beckett.

18:22.192 --> 18:23.627
She says she's fine.

18:24.866 --> 18:25.965
So what are you gonna do?

18:25.966 --> 18:26.944
The only thing I can do--

18:26.945 --> 18:29.184
try to figure out why he's
leaving these damn dolls behind.

18:29.185 --> 18:31.941
If I could just figure out
what painting they're from.

18:31.942 --> 18:32.990
Let me see.

18:39.687 --> 18:40.819
Chiaroscuro.

18:41.864 --> 18:43.180
You recognize that?

18:43.181 --> 18:44.038
It's a style of painting

18:44.039 --> 18:45.543
that was invented
during the renaissance,

18:45.544 --> 18:48.401
exemplified by strong contrast
between light and dark.

18:48.402 --> 18:50.106
We learned about
it in art history.

18:50.326 --> 18:51.960
Try looking up Caravaggio

18:51.961 --> 18:53.335
or Petrazano.

18:55.146 --> 18:56.831
Can I just say, this
school of yours

18:56.832 --> 18:58.734
is worth every penny I paid?

19:00.401 --> 19:01.709
Hey, this might be it.

19:02.155 --> 19:03.363
Petrazano.

19:03.701 --> 19:05.927
"The Persecution Of Kings."

19:25.947 --> 19:26.906
Beckett.

19:28.815 --> 19:30.225
DNA on the moleskin
was a bust.

19:30.226 --> 19:31.812
Ryan, you got results?

19:31.813 --> 19:33.603
There were no matches
in the CODIS database.

19:33.604 --> 19:35.800
The best the lab was able to do
was DNA phenotype,

19:35.801 --> 19:37.239
and they say they
think our sniper

19:37.240 --> 19:39.353
is a male with light
hair and brown eyes,

19:39.354 --> 19:42.306
but that still leaves us with
over 200 suspects on our list.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.986
I wouldn't cut
down the list yet.

19:43.987 --> 19:46.155
Given what we went through
with the shell casing,

19:46.192 --> 19:48.602
there's a chance the
moleskin's not even his.

19:49.641 --> 19:51.210
I know what the
paper dolls mean.

19:51.211 --> 19:53.813
Mr. Castle, now is not the
time for your theatrics.

19:53.814 --> 19:56.746
Captain, just listen.
The paper dolls are predictive.

19:56.747 --> 19:57.854
The dolls are cut
out of paintings

19:57.855 --> 20:00.756
that literally tell us the
location of the next target.

20:00.893 --> 20:02.813
The one that we found
at the first shooting,

20:02.814 --> 20:05.359
it comes from a painting called
"The Persecution Of Kings."

20:05.360 --> 20:07.959
- Henry Wyatt was killed on king street.
- Exactly.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.483
The one we found in the hide
of the second shooting,

20:09.484 --> 20:11.277
that's from a painting called
"The Fall From Grace."

20:11.278 --> 20:13.079
There's a Grace
Avenue in the Bronx.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.821
Grace church is on...
10th street and 4th Avenue.

20:15.822 --> 20:17.877
And there's about a dozen
other possibilities.

20:17.878 --> 20:18.992
If we can narrow it down...

20:18.993 --> 20:20.738
we might be able to
stop him from...

20:40.921 --> 20:42.094
Beckett.

20:43.947 --> 20:44.740
Grace.

20:44.741 --> 20:46.099
I don't know
where it's coming from!

20:46.100 --> 20:47.388
Right this way.

20:53.973 --> 20:54.912
How many people are dead?

20:54.913 --> 20:55.796
- None.
- Thank God.

20:55.797 --> 20:56.865
Yeah, sniper opened fire

20:56.866 --> 20:58.004
through the window of
a conference room,

20:58.005 --> 20:59.966
- on the 15th floor.
- Is anyone else injured?

20:59.967 --> 21:00.907
No, just her.

21:00.908 --> 21:03.302
Her name is Emily Reese,
and he only shot at her.

21:03.699 --> 21:05.549
Emily, my name is
detective Kate Beckett.

21:05.550 --> 21:07.587
I need you to tell
me what happened.

21:07.588 --> 21:08.802
Why me?

21:08.803 --> 21:10.142
What did I do?

21:10.790 --> 21:12.649
Why is somebody
trying to kill me.

21:12.650 --> 21:14.759
Emily, have you seen anybody
watching you lately?

21:14.760 --> 21:16.510
No. I-I don't know.
I don't know.

21:16.511 --> 21:18.264
- We gotta get her to the hospital.
- No!

21:18.265 --> 21:19.930
Don't let them take me outside.

21:19.931 --> 21:21.067
He's still out there.

21:21.068 --> 21:22.638
No, you're gonna be okay, Emily.

21:22.639 --> 21:24.469
Please don't do this.
He's out there.

21:24.470 --> 21:25.751
He's going to kill me. Please.

21:25.752 --> 21:26.628
Just go. Get her outta here.
Now. Go.

21:26.629 --> 21:28.727
Please. Please, no!

21:31.564 --> 21:32.628
Beckett.

21:33.907 --> 21:35.041
Kate.

22:00.377 --> 22:01.815
She's spinning out of control.

22:01.816 --> 22:03.794
She's losing her
ability to cope.

22:07.940 --> 22:10.157
Look, she should not
be on this case.

22:10.551 --> 22:11.984
Well, she's not just
gonna walk away.

22:11.985 --> 22:14.364
No, she's gonna drive
herself into the ground.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.733
And you're the only
one who has any clue

22:15.734 --> 22:17.267
as to what she's going through.

22:18.403 --> 22:19.657
So what helped you?

22:30.106 --> 22:32.216
Espo, what are we
doing back here?

22:32.826 --> 22:34.293
I want to show you something.

22:39.931 --> 22:40.781
What is that?

22:40.782 --> 22:42.960
The rifle that shot you.

22:44.925 --> 22:46.433
You are way outta line.

22:46.434 --> 22:47.441
Just look at it.

22:47.442 --> 22:49.855
No. What the hell are you doing?

22:49.960 --> 22:52.925
I've been where you are.
I know what you're going through.

22:53.629 --> 22:54.632
Javi, I'm fine.

22:54.633 --> 22:55.938
You're not fine.

22:56.271 --> 22:58.444
You're just trying
to act like you are.

22:59.396 --> 23:01.454
This is just a tool.

23:03.196 --> 23:04.588
It's a hunk of steel.

23:04.937 --> 23:06.773
It has no magical powers,

23:06.861 --> 23:08.098
and the person that fired it

23:08.099 --> 23:10.535
is not some all-powerful God.

23:11.909 --> 23:14.324
He's just a guy... with a gun,

23:14.501 --> 23:16.270
just like the guy
we're hunting now.

23:16.286 --> 23:19.223
And like every other bad
guy, he's damaged goods.

23:25.347 --> 23:26.570
So am I.

23:29.677 --> 23:30.847
That's right.

23:31.570 --> 23:32.948
And that's okay.

23:34.382 --> 23:35.731
You think it's a weakness?

23:37.006 --> 23:38.417
Make it a strength.

23:40.688 --> 23:42.152
It's a part of you.

23:46.667 --> 23:47.989
So use it.

24:29.472 --> 24:31.584
Any idea why the sniper
targeted Emily Reese?

24:31.585 --> 24:33.897
Not yet. She was a VP
at a telecom company,

24:33.898 --> 24:36.104
single, just bought an
apartment on West 96th.

24:36.105 --> 24:37.652
No known connections
to the other vics.

24:37.653 --> 24:39.965
But we do know he
was following her.

24:39.966 --> 24:42.341
Castle, what do you have?

24:42.373 --> 24:44.317
You're looking at a video
taken from Emily's lobby

24:44.318 --> 24:45.698
yesterday at 1:40.

24:45.699 --> 24:47.813
That's four hours
after he shot Wyatt.

24:47.991 --> 24:50.337
There's Emily, getting
into the elevator.

24:51.961 --> 24:53.088
There he is.

24:53.089 --> 24:54.399
That's our guy.

24:54.810 --> 24:57.279
Yeah. Unfortunately, we
still can't see his face.

25:02.184 --> 25:03.583
What is he waiting for?

25:03.584 --> 25:05.613
He's watching to see what
floor she'd get off on.

25:05.614 --> 25:07.566
He knew exactly where
she was gonna be.

25:07.567 --> 25:09.022
It's a miracle Emily's not dead.

25:09.023 --> 25:11.258
It's not a miracle.
It's poor planning.

25:11.348 --> 25:13.336
Turns out our sniper
used the wrong ammo.

25:13.337 --> 25:16.039
The 1-6-8 grain loses stability
when it goes through glass.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.338
The 1-6-5 is designed
for that kinda shot.

25:18.339 --> 25:19.670
He didn't know that, which means

25:19.671 --> 25:21.425
he has less experience
than we thought.

25:21.426 --> 25:23.464
Okay, we need to go back
to the suspect list,

25:23.465 --> 25:24.968
cross off all law
enforcement shooters

25:24.969 --> 25:27.037
and any combat vets with
urban experience.

25:27.084 --> 25:28.053
All right.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.966
Is it just me...

25:30.903 --> 25:33.290
or is his coffee cup
identical to Emily's?

25:33.291 --> 25:34.355
Same logo.

25:34.356 --> 25:35.764
It's from the same shop.

25:36.005 --> 25:37.285
Zoom in on that.

25:37.802 --> 25:38.972
Caffe...

25:39.201 --> 25:40.039
Primo.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.259
Must have followed
her from there.

25:41.260 --> 25:43.924
I-if he's a customer, maybe
someone can ID him.

25:44.882 --> 25:48.121
There's only one Caffe Primo.
It's on 47th Street, 2 blocks

25:48.122 --> 25:49.560
from the Grace Point Tower
where Emily worked.

25:49.561 --> 25:51.845
Okay, we need to find out
if any of the other victims

25:51.846 --> 25:53.056
have a connection to that shop.

25:53.057 --> 25:54.280
All right.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.685
Uh, where's Beckett?

25:57.543 --> 25:58.936
She's running down a lead.

26:19.408 --> 26:20.582
Why would you shoot from here

26:20.583 --> 26:22.925
when the roof gave
you a cleaner shot?

26:53.981 --> 26:55.753
That coffee shop may be the key.

26:55.754 --> 26:58.877
Sarah Vasquez lived six blocks
from the Grace Point Tower.

26:58.878 --> 27:00.948
And she had a receipt in her
wallet from Caffe Primo

27:00.949 --> 27:02.003
dated three days ago.

27:02.004 --> 27:03.450
What about Henry Wyatt?

27:03.451 --> 27:04.939
Wyatt's therapist has an office

27:04.940 --> 27:06.937
right across the street
from the coffee shop.

27:06.938 --> 27:08.643
He had a session two days
before he was killed.

27:08.644 --> 27:10.046
That shop's gotta be ground zero

27:10.047 --> 27:11.657
where he selected his victims.

27:11.658 --> 27:13.468
Get the hell down there
and get me an ID.

27:13.469 --> 27:15.643
The clock's ticking
on his next victim.

27:18.268 --> 27:19.926
Yeah, they all get coffee here

27:19.927 --> 27:21.372
on a pretty regular basis.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.609
Are you saying he shoots
people from my shop?

27:23.610 --> 27:24.760
It could be just a coincidence.

27:24.761 --> 27:26.311
Have any of them been
in here together?

27:26.312 --> 27:29.050
Maybe talking to each other or
anyone else for that matter.

27:29.051 --> 27:30.742
- Not that I remember.
- What about this guy?

27:30.743 --> 27:32.123
Is he a customer?

27:32.657 --> 27:33.457
Is that the sniper?

27:33.458 --> 27:35.500
Have you seen him?
Does he look familiar?

27:35.501 --> 27:36.630
No.

27:36.631 --> 27:38.497
Sorry. Maybe if I could get
a better look at his face--

27:38.498 --> 27:39.585
Robert, phone call.

27:39.586 --> 27:40.831
Excuse me.

27:41.676 --> 27:43.091
I'm just praying
that I get accepted.

27:43.092 --> 27:45.089
Your dad's an alumni.
You're in for sure.

27:45.090 --> 27:47.151
Yo, dude.
I totally closed the deal.

27:47.152 --> 27:49.529
Eight figures and a piece
of the merchandising.

27:49.530 --> 27:51.164
No, it was epic, bro.

27:57.644 --> 27:58.863
Hey, can you go in the back

27:58.864 --> 28:00.024
and get some more of
that, uh, creamer?

28:00.025 --> 28:01.362
I hate to think that any
of these people are dead

28:01.363 --> 28:03.135
just because they picked the
wrong place to buy coffee.

28:03.136 --> 28:05.847
It's not the coffee shop.
I know how the victims are connected.

28:05.848 --> 28:06.390
How?

28:06.391 --> 28:08.060
Sarah Vasquez just got engaged,

28:08.061 --> 28:10.761
Henry Wyatt just made
partner at his firm...

28:10.762 --> 28:12.267
And Emily Reese just
bought a giant apartment

28:12.268 --> 28:13.120
on the Upper West Side.

28:13.121 --> 28:15.054
They all had recent successes.

28:15.055 --> 28:18.215
According to our profile, this
sniper is a paranoid loner.

28:18.216 --> 28:19.958
He feels alienated,

28:19.959 --> 28:21.791
victimized by the world.

28:21.907 --> 28:23.156
He comes into here
for a cup of coffee,

28:23.157 --> 28:25.385
and he hears about how
well everyone's doing,

28:25.386 --> 28:27.030
how their dreams are coming true

28:27.031 --> 28:28.867
while his are not.

28:28.929 --> 28:29.867
Makes him feel invisible,

28:29.868 --> 28:31.773
makes him feel angry.

28:31.774 --> 28:34.714
So he picks one of them out,
and he makes them pay.

28:34.715 --> 28:36.231
But even if you're right,
it doesn't get us

28:36.232 --> 28:37.905
any closer to catching this guy.

28:37.906 --> 28:40.100
It might if we ask
the right question.

28:43.301 --> 28:44.691
He didn't shoot from the roof

28:44.692 --> 28:46.596
because he couldn't
climb the ladder.

28:46.788 --> 28:48.171
If you look at the video,
there's a slight hitch

28:48.172 --> 28:48.702
in his step.

28:48.703 --> 28:50.806
I think he has a
physical disability.

28:50.986 --> 28:52.186
Uh, Robert.

28:52.516 --> 28:53.378
Does this ring a bell?

28:53.379 --> 28:56.310
A guy with a limp
or a leg injury?

28:56.311 --> 28:57.367
There is a homeless guy

28:57.368 --> 28:58.927
who's been hanging around
the last few weeks.

28:58.928 --> 29:00.870
I think he's got a
prosthetic leg.

29:01.001 --> 29:02.597
We're gonna need a description.

29:05.834 --> 29:07.433
All right, adding disability

29:07.434 --> 29:10.915
and partial and/or full
amputation to the list

29:10.916 --> 29:13.908
cuts it down from 207...

29:15.879 --> 29:17.003
to three.

29:18.121 --> 29:20.244
- Erik Howard, Lee Travis--
- That's him.

29:20.245 --> 29:21.510
Lee Travis.

29:24.751 --> 29:25.625
He's 38 years old.

29:25.626 --> 29:28.235
He did a year in the marines
before losing his right leg

29:28.236 --> 29:30.204
in a hit-and-run
motorcycle accident.

29:30.205 --> 29:31.274
Never caught the
driver of the car,

29:31.275 --> 29:32.838
and Lee was given an
honorable discharge.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.073
And according to his counselor,
Lee went into a deep depression.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.740
Turned his anger
against the world.

29:36.741 --> 29:39.032
He a string of low-paying
jobs, including a stint

29:39.033 --> 29:42.252
as a security guard for the
Metropolitan Museum Of Art,

29:42.253 --> 29:43.788
where his former boss said
he spent a lot of time

29:43.789 --> 29:47.466
in the old masters section, home
of Caravaggio and Petrazano.

29:47.467 --> 29:50.687
All right, I'm releasing Lee's
photo and bio to the media.

29:50.688 --> 29:53.450
Within the hour, every person in
New York will know who he is.

29:53.451 --> 29:55.295
Wait, sir.
Are you sure that's a good idea?

29:55.296 --> 29:57.060
If he knows that
we're closing in,

29:57.061 --> 29:58.625
that might trigger
another shooting.

29:58.626 --> 29:59.625
We need to risk it.

29:59.672 --> 30:00.932
We put his face out there,

30:00.933 --> 30:03.077
it could give us a lead
on his whereabouts.

30:03.078 --> 30:04.187
What do we know
about his family?

30:04.188 --> 30:05.365
Lee has a sister in Queens.

30:05.366 --> 30:07.299
Esposito's tracking
her down right now.

30:07.447 --> 30:08.875
Are you sure it's him?

30:08.876 --> 30:10.013
Yes.

30:12.475 --> 30:13.943
You're not surprised.

30:16.087 --> 30:17.157
Lee's an angry guy.

30:17.158 --> 30:19.025
He has been since the accident.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.009
I tried to do what I could, but...

30:21.189 --> 30:23.631
you can't give help if
someone won't take it.

30:25.434 --> 30:28.073
It breaks my heart that he
would do something like this.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.128
When was the last
time you saw him?

30:30.129 --> 30:30.881
About a month ago.

30:30.882 --> 30:33.697
He came out to
Queens for the day.

30:34.439 --> 30:35.921
It didn't go well.

30:35.922 --> 30:37.412
He lost his apartment,

30:37.413 --> 30:39.980
wanted me to ask him to
move in with us, but...

30:42.578 --> 30:44.642
I didn't want him
around the kids.

30:46.035 --> 30:47.673
Do you know where he's living?

30:49.820 --> 30:51.874
I gave him my old
car when he left.

30:51.875 --> 30:54.199
It's a blue Plymouth Duster.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.850
Do you think you could write
down the license plate number?

30:57.437 --> 30:58.858
Excuse me.

30:59.830 --> 31:01.218
Beckett.

31:02.418 --> 31:03.533
Where?

31:03.775 --> 31:05.321
We're on our way.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.008
I'm sorry. We gotta go.

31:06.009 --> 31:07.556
Uniforms just found
the third hide

31:07.557 --> 31:09.531
where Emily Reese was shot from.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.644
Detective.

31:11.645 --> 31:14.288
I know my brother's done
terrible things, but...

31:15.845 --> 31:17.668
please don't hurt him.

31:22.026 --> 31:23.700
How is he finding these places?

31:23.701 --> 31:26.489
The same way he chooses
his victims. He listens.

31:26.490 --> 31:29.503
He's homeless, so
nobody notices him.

31:30.291 --> 31:32.230
Once he finds a building
that he'll be shooting from,

31:32.231 --> 31:35.427
he recons it for the
best vantage point.

31:35.857 --> 31:37.060
Castle...

31:37.609 --> 31:39.041
we need to find that paper doll,

31:39.042 --> 31:41.219
see where he's
gonna strike next.

31:55.952 --> 31:57.327
Found it.

32:00.116 --> 32:01.003
Oh, my God.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.731
Does it ID the next victim?

32:02.900 --> 32:04.315
Not victim.

32:06.465 --> 32:07.995
Victims.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.620
A patrol unit found Lee's car.

32:22.792 --> 32:23.921
These were in the trunk.

32:23.922 --> 32:25.637
- Any sign of the gun?
- No.

32:26.359 --> 32:26.947
All right.

32:26.948 --> 32:30.015
Listen up.
I want all units on tactical alert.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.878
Lee Travis is out there
right now with his weapon,

32:32.879 --> 32:34.826
intending to kill
multiple victims.

32:34.827 --> 32:37.008
And given that the first three
were shot in the morning,

32:37.009 --> 32:38.658
we don't have a lot of time.

32:38.862 --> 32:40.181
I got it!

32:41.388 --> 32:43.429
You know where he cut the
chain of dolls from?

32:43.430 --> 32:45.520
I convinced them to let
me into the museum early.

32:45.805 --> 32:46.649
I compared the dolls

32:46.650 --> 32:48.605
to all the paintings
in their collection.

32:48.606 --> 32:50.529
It's called "Lions
In The Meadow."

32:50.530 --> 32:53.017
The only meadow I know
of in New York is at...

32:53.018 --> 32:54.883
is in Central Park.

32:55.029 --> 32:57.125
We should assume that Travis
is already in position.

32:57.126 --> 32:59.216
If we start clearing the
park, he might start firing.

32:59.217 --> 33:01.710
Whoever these dozen victims
are, he's targeting them

33:01.711 --> 33:03.497
for the same reason he
went after the others,

33:03.498 --> 33:05.430
so we can assume they're all
part of the same group.

33:05.431 --> 33:07.571
Beckett, take everyone we can
spare, head for the park.

33:07.572 --> 33:08.995
I want you in place
and ready to move

33:08.996 --> 33:09.730
when we figure this out.

33:09.731 --> 33:11.908
Ryan, get on the phone
to the Parks Department.

33:11.909 --> 33:14.126
Find out what they have
scheduled there this morning.

33:15.223 --> 33:16.427
Castle, you coming?

33:16.428 --> 33:17.987
I'm more useful
here, helping Ryan

33:17.988 --> 33:19.336
figure out who the targets are.

33:19.337 --> 33:20.629
You got this.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.587
All that tree cover is gonna
make it hard for him to target

33:53.588 --> 33:54.914
any large area of the park.

33:54.915 --> 33:57.178
Also, the buildings on the east
and west sides of the park

33:57.179 --> 33:59.243
are high-end apartments
with doormen.

33:59.244 --> 34:00.754
Which means he would
have to shoot

34:00.755 --> 34:02.148
from the South end of the park.

34:02.149 --> 34:03.987
I just got off the phone
with the Parks Department.

34:03.988 --> 34:06.590
There's over a dozen events
planned in Central Park today.

34:06.591 --> 34:07.565
Anything on the south end?

34:07.566 --> 34:10.523
A nature sanctuary tour and a...

34:10.524 --> 34:12.320
celebration for
Western High School.

34:12.321 --> 34:14.270
Their track team just won
the state championship.

34:14.271 --> 34:16.043
They should be on their way
into the park right now.

34:16.043 --> 34:18.297
Wait. Western High
School's three blocks away

34:18.297 --> 34:19.980
from the coffee shop.
Their team's called The Lions.

34:19.981 --> 34:21.938
Lee must have heard one of
the parents or students

34:21.938 --> 34:23.355
boasting about
winning that meet.

34:23.356 --> 34:24.617
How are they getting
to the park?

34:24.618 --> 34:25.360
Coming in by bus.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.407
I'll call ESU.

34:26.408 --> 34:28.815
Ryan, we need to stop that bus.

34:59.411 --> 35:01.288
Listen, the school
has a bus unloading

35:01.289 --> 35:04.071
at the Grand Army Plaza
entrance at the park.

35:04.072 --> 35:06.018
ESU told Gates that
these two buildings

35:06.019 --> 35:08.121
have the best vantage
point for the sniper.

35:08.122 --> 35:09.612
How long till ESU
countersnipers get here?

35:09.613 --> 35:12.485
10 minutes, so search all of
the floors above the 20th.

35:12.486 --> 35:13.619
Let's go.

35:22.062 --> 35:23.586
Come on. Come on.

35:24.982 --> 35:26.781
Answer your phone, damn it!

35:49.319 --> 35:50.165
I got an open door.

35:50.166 --> 35:52.492
Suite 24-21. I'm going in.

36:38.751 --> 36:40.301
Stop! Police!

36:54.413 --> 36:56.032
Put the gun down, Lee.

36:56.307 --> 36:57.759
I have a job to do.

36:58.904 --> 37:00.565
Why don't you just call
it what it is, okay?

37:00.566 --> 37:02.539
You shoot people in cold blood.

37:02.540 --> 37:04.665
Those people deserve
what they're getting.

37:04.666 --> 37:06.390
God blessed them.

37:06.813 --> 37:09.896
He gave to them and
took from me--

37:10.280 --> 37:12.333
my leg, my life.

37:12.334 --> 37:13.914
How is that fair, huh?

37:14.193 --> 37:15.672
How is that right?

37:16.488 --> 37:19.252
Those people that you blame?
They're no different from you.

37:19.253 --> 37:20.988
You're just saying that
'cause you're one of 'em.

37:20.989 --> 37:23.445
You think my life is a picnic?

37:30.970 --> 37:33.980
I know what if feels like
to be in those crosshairs,

37:34.111 --> 37:36.168
to feel the bullet
burn through my chest.

37:36.169 --> 37:40.541
I know what it feels like to
have my life leave my body.

37:41.340 --> 37:42.365
And I think you do, too.

37:42.366 --> 37:44.489
That's why you keep leaving
those paper dolls behind,

37:44.490 --> 37:46.786
because you're
looking for somebody

37:46.787 --> 37:48.703
to help you find another way.

37:50.834 --> 37:52.272
There is no other way.

37:52.273 --> 37:53.276
- Not anymore.
- No.

37:53.277 --> 37:54.172
- It's too late.
- No, no.

37:54.173 --> 37:55.954
There's always another way.

37:56.124 --> 37:58.417
I want to help you.
I know that you're in pain,

37:58.418 --> 38:00.400
and we can find a better
voice for your pain.

38:00.401 --> 38:02.177
- Please just put that gun down.
 -Just turn around.

38:02.178 --> 38:04.050
- No.
- Don't look at me. Just turn around.

38:04.051 --> 38:04.853
- No!
- Turn around!

38:04.854 --> 38:07.449
No. If you're gonna shoot me,

38:07.598 --> 38:10.063
you look at me in
the eyes, okay?

38:10.064 --> 38:11.395
And you look hard,

38:11.396 --> 38:14.461
because I am not your enemy.
I can't be.

38:15.319 --> 38:17.525
You and I have too
much in common.

38:24.553 --> 38:25.896
No, we don't.

38:27.594 --> 38:29.308
I have a job to do.

38:33.390 --> 38:34.724
Sorry.

39:01.182 --> 39:02.016
Hey.

39:02.017 --> 39:03.305
Hey.

39:06.265 --> 39:07.067
What are you doing?

39:07.068 --> 39:08.809
Just waiting for my partner.

39:09.326 --> 39:10.986
Maybe you've seen her.

39:11.469 --> 39:12.451
Pretty girl,

39:12.452 --> 39:15.461
thinks she can leap tall
buildings in a single bound,

39:15.462 --> 39:18.711
carries the weight of the world
on her shoulders, yet...

39:18.805 --> 39:21.753
still manages to laugh
at some of my jokes.

39:23.864 --> 39:24.919
She sounds like a handful.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.547
Tell me about it.

39:27.783 --> 39:28.968
Anyway...

39:28.969 --> 39:30.401
if you do see her,

39:30.476 --> 39:31.940
tell her she owes me about

39:31.941 --> 39:33.792
a hundred coffees.

39:36.448 --> 39:37.953
Castle.

39:40.482 --> 39:41.889
Thank you.

39:41.955 --> 39:43.310
For what?

39:44.785 --> 39:45.897
For not pushing

39:45.898 --> 39:48.641
and giving me the space
to get through this.

39:50.704 --> 39:52.183
Always.

39:59.392 --> 40:03.105
So how do you feel now
that Lee Travis is dead?

40:07.292 --> 40:10.390
I thought that taking him
down would resolve things,

40:10.391 --> 40:12.630
but... it's still there.

40:12.631 --> 40:15.705
Because you haven't fully dealt
with what happened to you.

40:15.973 --> 40:16.738
No.

40:16.739 --> 40:19.743
I felt it before the shooting.

40:21.743 --> 40:23.593
I think it's always been there,

40:23.800 --> 40:26.729
deep inside, since that night.

40:27.949 --> 40:29.583
The night your mom was killed.

40:29.584 --> 40:30.975
Mm-hmm.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.558
I've let it define me, drive me.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.745
It's made me who I am.

40:38.488 --> 40:40.111
But now...

40:42.675 --> 40:44.111
But now?

40:45.192 --> 40:47.529
I want to be more

40:47.634 --> 40:49.385
than who I am.

40:54.638 --> 40:56.267
But I don't know if I
know how to do that

40:56.268 --> 40:59.261
without letting my mom down.

40:59.497 --> 41:01.113
She's dead, Kate.

41:01.548 --> 41:03.330
You can't let her down.

41:05.004 --> 41:08.253
The only person you can
let down is yourself.

41:10.837 --> 41:12.899
Her death is a part of you.

41:13.504 --> 41:16.120
And you're gonna have to
make peace with that,

41:16.121 --> 41:18.326
just like you're gonna
have to make peace

41:18.327 --> 41:20.541
with the scars from
your shooting.

41:23.848 --> 41:26.063
But it doesn't
have to limit you.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.849
How am I supposed to let go?

41:31.901 --> 41:33.659
I can help you.

41:34.282 --> 41:36.089
But the question is,

41:36.464 --> 41:38.280
are you ready?

41:46.248 --> 41:47.304
Yeah, I think I am.
