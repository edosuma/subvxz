09:42.016 --> 09:43.617
Yeah, pretty much.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.954
Hey, anywhere we can get gas
around here -- but cheap gas?

09:45.987 --> 09:48.122
We all know how stingy
your gas stations are.

09:48.156 --> 09:50.024
I mean, the 93 octane

09:50.058 --> 09:53.194
is 9 cents more a gallon
than the 87 octane,

09:53.227 --> 09:56.297
and there's no noticeable
difference in performance!

09:56.330 --> 09:57.665
I mean, we found a place
that's what?

09:57.698 --> 10:01.602
$1.39 a gallon, but then
you're talking travel time

10:01.635 --> 10:03.204
in between and then back.

10:03.237 --> 10:04.672
It's simple math
right there.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.675
You got your mileage and then
your travel time and then,

10:07.708 --> 10:10.378
of course, your general
inconvenience of going,

10:10.411 --> 10:12.446
how many miles is that
out of my way --

10:12.480 --> 10:14.115
Sheriff: Then they talked
on and on

10:14.148 --> 10:16.117
about gas prices for a while.

10:16.150 --> 10:17.986
That's about when I left,

10:18.019 --> 10:19.888
and that's basically
how it happened.

10:19.921 --> 10:21.289
Okay.
All right.

10:21.322 --> 10:23.157
The whole squid-extinction
dinner thread --

10:23.191 --> 10:25.226
what happened --
what happened there?

10:25.259 --> 10:28.362
Oh, well, they decided
after all not to eat her.

10:28.396 --> 10:30.631
And it turns out
they weren't hungry.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.033
I don't really know.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.468
The aliens
mind-erased me, see.

10:34.502 --> 10:36.704
Well, that's certainly
one explanation

10:36.737 --> 10:39.007
for how this smartphone
ended up in your, uh...

10:39.040 --> 10:40.374
caboose.

10:40.408 --> 10:43.311
But see the rectal
tearing here and there?

10:43.344 --> 10:46.147
That seems to indicate
that the phone was, uh, forcibly

10:46.180 --> 10:48.917
inserted through the --
the ol' outdoor.

10:48.950 --> 10:50.484
But I -- I swallowed it!

10:50.518 --> 10:52.987
I sure as hell didn't put it up
there for sexual pleasure,

10:53.021 --> 10:54.422
if that's what
you're thinking.

10:54.455 --> 10:55.823
Oh, it's not just
what I'm thinking.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.526
-Then I want a second opinion!
-Fine, here.

10:58.559 --> 11:00.328
Do you believe a word
of this bullshit

11:00.361 --> 11:03.097
about the aliens
and the talking cup?

11:03.131 --> 11:05.366
[ High-pitched ]
Hell no.

11:07.201 --> 11:12.106
Made in Georgia.
