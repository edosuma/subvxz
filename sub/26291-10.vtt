WEBVTT

00:21.630 --> 00:23.284
Hey, Laurel.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.460
Oh, my gosh,
it's a beautiful sunrise.

00:25.503 --> 00:26.678
It's great. I wish you...

00:33.946 --> 00:35.687
What are...

00:42.346 --> 00:45.871
I don't know what you
want, but I'm not resisting.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.222
What...

00:48.265 --> 00:50.485
Look, if you'd just--

00:50.528 --> 00:52.226
just talk to me...

00:52.269 --> 00:53.183
MAN:
Be quiet and listen.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.924
Who is this?

00:54.967 --> 00:57.535
Your name is Dwayne Pride.
I know everything about you.

00:57.579 --> 01:00.190
Pay attention.
These people owe their lives

01:00.234 --> 01:02.149
or deaths to you.What's this about?

01:02.192 --> 01:04.803
You'll be given instructions
over the next few hours.

01:04.847 --> 01:05.978
It's imperative you comply.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.372
If you don't, someone dies.

01:08.416 --> 01:09.634
Do you understand?

01:09.678 --> 01:10.722
Who are you?

01:10.766 --> 01:11.897
This isn't a conversation,

01:11.941 --> 01:12.898
Mr. Pride.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.684
You will comply.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.816
What? No. No.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.428
Wha-- No.

01:20.471 --> 01:21.646
Wait.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.258
Do you understand?

01:24.301 --> 01:26.260
Yes! Yes, I understand!

01:26.303 --> 01:27.522
Please, wait.

01:27.565 --> 01:28.697
Please...

01:30.307 --> 01:32.570
: Every move
you make will be monitored.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.659
Every second you take
will be accounted for.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.661
Wait, please, please,
can I talk to Loretta?

01:43.451 --> 01:45.409
Give you a hand?

01:45.453 --> 01:46.845
What?

01:46.889 --> 01:48.456
What? No.

01:48.499 --> 01:49.848
Suit yourself.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.415
I don't have time for you.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.113
You still have some time,
Dwayne.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.114
But not much.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.724
Get out of here!Okay.

01:55.767 --> 01:56.681
One thing though.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.161
What?Truck.

02:07.605 --> 02:10.130
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:10.173 --> 02:12.741
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:12.784 --> 02:15.178
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:15.222 --> 02:16.397
♪ How, how, how, how

02:16.440 --> 02:18.573
♪ Hey, hey

02:24.796 --> 02:26.146
♪ You gotta come on.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.067
Go to the top of the levee.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.721
Hey, man!
Are you okay?

02:36.765 --> 02:38.288
Don't respond. Just go.

02:38.332 --> 02:41.639
Buddy,
are you hurt

02:41.683 --> 02:42.945
Where you goin'?!

02:42.988 --> 02:46.166
Hey! Hello!

02:50.474 --> 02:52.476
Go to the car.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.786
Open the hatch.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.185
Those are your clothes
and your credentials.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.229
Get dressed,

03:06.273 --> 03:08.100
get in the car, and drive.

03:08.144 --> 03:09.667
Where am I going?

03:09.711 --> 03:10.929
Belle Chasse.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.540
You have 30 minutes.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.153
30 minutes isn't enough time.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.807
Go now.What do you need me to do?

03:27.294 --> 03:30.079
You know, none
of this is random.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.255
I'm here for a purpose.
We need to talk.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.691
I can't talk now.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.216
No riddles, no
memories, all right?

03:36.259 --> 03:38.000
I need to focus.Eyes on the road, Dwayne.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.136
I'm gonna tell you a story.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.573
Please don't.

03:45.616 --> 03:48.706
There was a merchant in Baghdad.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.534
He went to market
for supplies.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.537
He gets jostled
by a beautiful woman.

03:53.581 --> 03:54.886
He goes pale.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.540
Do you know why?

03:56.584 --> 03:58.760
Because she was Death.

03:58.803 --> 04:01.110
Yes. And she
was there for him.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.764
But he's not ready to die.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.331
He runs back to his shop,

04:04.374 --> 04:07.508
tells his servant
to prepare his fastest horse.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.205
He'll ride to Samarra
immediately,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.816
where Death won't find him.

04:11.860 --> 04:12.817
That night,

04:12.861 --> 04:14.819
Death appears at his shop.

04:14.863 --> 04:18.214
The servant tells her,
"My master is gone."

04:18.258 --> 04:20.042
Offers her a meal.

04:20.085 --> 04:22.044
But you see, Dwayne,

04:22.087 --> 04:24.351
Death can't stay.

04:24.394 --> 04:27.354
And do you know why?

04:27.397 --> 04:31.836
Because she has
an appointment in Samarra.

04:36.232 --> 04:39.888
No. No, no, no, no.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.282
Not now.

04:44.762 --> 04:45.676
Why are you stopping?

04:45.720 --> 04:46.808
I'm being pulled over.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.331
Doesn't matter.
You need to keep going.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.290
I'll handle this.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.732
Want to explain why
you're driving

04:57.775 --> 04:59.168
25 miles over the
speed limit, sir?

04:59.211 --> 05:03.085
Special Agent
Dwayne Pride, NCIS.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.086
Where you headed?

05:04.129 --> 05:05.087
Belle Chasse.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.481
Get rid of him.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.309
You nearly hit a car back there.I know.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.093
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm working a big case.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.137
Time-sensitive.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.925
Understood.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.927
How 'bout I escort you
the rest of the way?

05:18.970 --> 05:20.145
Might be a
little safer.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.930
That's not part of the plan.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.585
Uh, it's-it's okay.
I-I got this.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.587
It'll keep you from having
any more near misses.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.937
All right. We'll handle him.No.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.852
What's wrong?

05:30.895 --> 05:32.375
Look, I can't explain.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.942
But I need to go right now,
and you need

05:33.985 --> 05:35.465
to leave
for your own safety, too.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.827
You killed him.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.612
Nope. You killed him.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.135
You tried to warn him.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.180
Lesson learned. Drive.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.400
I-I can't, I can't just--

05:57.444 --> 05:59.228
I can't just leave him.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.056
Dr. Wade or your father are next

06:01.099 --> 06:03.406
unless you get in the car
and drive.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.203
HANNAH:
We got a problem.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.597
State trooper was gunned down
in Jefferson Parish.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.599
Dwayne's credentials were
found next to the body.

06:22.643 --> 06:23.861
What

06:23.905 --> 06:25.559
Trooper pulled him over.
Ran his plates.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.038
Where's Pride now?

06:27.082 --> 06:28.562
Witnesses say he fled the scene.No way.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.999
I'm calling him.I already tried him.
He's not answering.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.043
We got a problem.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.393
Yeah, we know. Pride.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.742
I was talking with Laurel.
She was on the phone

06:34.785 --> 06:35.743
with Pride this morning.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.179
Line went dead.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.659
Couldn't get back in touch.
Me either.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.008
Yeah, well,
whatever's happened is connected

06:40.051 --> 06:41.183
to this dead state trooper.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.967
Went to voice mail.
I don't like this.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.404
Sebastian's gone to get Loretta.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.709
They're headed
to the crime scene.

06:45.753 --> 06:46.797
I'll meet 'em there.I'm coming with you.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.016
No, wait, Christopher,

06:48.059 --> 06:50.453
you guys need
to track Dwayne down. GPS,

06:50.497 --> 06:51.541
cell phone,
whatever it takes.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.369
I need you here.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.805
I'll keep in touch.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.677
Come on.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.381
Made it just under the wire.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.036
Now what?

07:08.079 --> 07:10.647
Go inside to your ASAC's office.

07:10.691 --> 07:11.692
Alone.

07:11.735 --> 07:14.477
What if the ASAC's there?

07:14.521 --> 07:16.566
He's been called away
on a family emergency.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.916
How do you know...I just do.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.527
Interact with no one.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.659
You know what happens if you do.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.922
Yes. I get it.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.490
Once I'm in?

07:27.534 --> 07:29.013
Be patient, Pride.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.841
And check yourself
in the mirror.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.496
You have some of the trooper's
blood on your face.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.079
Good morning.

07:51.122 --> 07:53.124
Morning, sir.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.441
Okay, I'm here.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.878
What do you want?

08:07.922 --> 08:11.708
An internal memo for joint
NCIS/CIA Operation Copperhead.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.275
I've never heard of Copperhead.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.450
It's compartmented.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.017
And it won't be on the computer.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.759
It's in the safe.

08:18.802 --> 08:21.457
I'm special agent in charge.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.939
Every compartmented file
goes through me.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.549
See the lengths I'm going to?

08:26.593 --> 08:28.508
The file's there.Yeah, well,

08:28.551 --> 08:31.554
if it's not here, then you
and I have some serious...

08:32.599 --> 08:34.644
You found it.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.516
Mostly redacted.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.692
Doesn't matter. There's
an address in the header.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.868
You're going there next.
You have 20 minutes.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.565
Wait, wait, what...

08:42.609 --> 08:45.046
what is Operation Copperhead?

08:45.089 --> 08:46.743
Just go.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.664
Dwayne.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.666
I've been
looking for you.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.625
We need to talk.Yeah, um...

08:58.668 --> 09:00.496
I don't-- I don't have time
right now. I got to run.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.280
Yeah, does it have something
to do with this?

09:03.847 --> 09:05.632
I was just at the crime scene.

09:05.675 --> 09:08.678
When they told me
that you'd arrived here, I...

09:12.377 --> 09:14.989
You want to tell me what
happened with the state trooper?

09:15.032 --> 09:16.991
Be careful, Pride.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.515
You fled the scene.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.343
You're not answering your phone.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.650
People are worried.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.608
Including Laurel.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.175
Ticktock.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.439
You're right.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.658
Yeah.

09:31.701 --> 09:32.833
Come here.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.443
Listen,

09:34.486 --> 09:35.966
let me just go grab one thing,
all right?

09:36.010 --> 09:37.359
And then I'll come back and
I'll tell you everything.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.360
Everything.

09:38.403 --> 09:39.622
Give me a second.

09:39.666 --> 09:42.059
Oh, my God.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.326
W...

09:52.330 --> 09:55.116
Why aren't you at
the crime scene with Doc Wade?

09:55.159 --> 09:56.770
'Cause I can't find her.
I went to her place.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.772
The door was busted open.
There were signs of a struggle.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.687
You think she
was abducted?Yeah, I'm sure of it.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.037
She's not the only one. That
was the U.S. Marshals Service.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.561
One of their men was murdered
in Evansville, Kentucky.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.519
That marshal
was watching Cassius.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.651
Assuming he's gone, too.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.870
The last 36 hours.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.393
What the hell's going on here?

10:12.742 --> 10:14.831
That's Belle Chasse.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.224
Hey.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.878
Loretta's missing.
So is Pride's dad.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.402
Well, that goes a long way
to explain Dwayne's behavior.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.578
You saw him?He was here a few minutes,

10:22.622 --> 10:23.840
and he just disappeared.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.668
Disappear--
What do you mean, "disappear"?

10:25.712 --> 10:28.149
Didn't you try to stop him,
find out what's going on?

10:28.192 --> 10:30.020
Didn't you maybe say...Hey, Gregorio,

10:30.064 --> 10:31.718
'course I did.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.415
He's been compromised

10:33.458 --> 10:34.851
in some way.
He slipped off.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.592
Why go to Belle Chasse at all?

10:36.636 --> 10:39.682
To gain access
to a classified document

10:39.726 --> 10:41.423
on a CIA operation here
in New Orleans.

10:41.466 --> 10:42.859
Code-named Copperhead.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.165
And what's Copperhead?

10:44.208 --> 10:45.688
Something so sensitive

10:45.732 --> 10:47.690
that no one in the Southeast
was read in

10:47.734 --> 10:49.736
except for ASAC Thompson.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.955
Till now.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.097
You're 30 seconds
from the safe house.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.186
Agent Khoury knows
something's up.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.101
It's just a matter of time
before...

11:07.144 --> 11:08.798
That's why you'll move fast.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.627
Inside the safe house is
an asset. You'll gain access.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.282
How am I supposed to just walk
into a CIA safe house

11:14.325 --> 11:15.762
and demand to see this asset?

11:15.805 --> 11:18.634
Use the term "Apollyon."
They'll let you in.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.940
No. Not good enough.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.637
I've done everything you asked.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.639
I want some good faith
in return.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.685
There's no bargaining here.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.730
Then I can't help.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.863
I understand.
Your mind's reeling,

11:29.906 --> 11:32.953
playing out every scenario,
trying to get control.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.650
But you have none.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.826
Don't think. Just act.

11:51.188 --> 11:54.496
♪

12:02.896 --> 12:05.507
Special Agent in
Charge Pride. NCIS.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.683
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

12:07.727 --> 12:11.034
I need to see the
asset for debrief.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.080
We were expecting ASAC Thompson.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.429
Yeah. Yeah.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.866
He's unavailable.
I'm here.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.868
This was not part of the plan.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.783
You say you
know who I am.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.046
Then you know I wouldn't be
here unless it was vital

12:23.090 --> 12:25.005
that I see the asset.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.621
It's about Apollyon.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.930
All right.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.541
Understood. Come on.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.779
I know I don't need
to tell you, of all people...

13:00.867 --> 13:02.999
...but be careful.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.045
Of course.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.292
Shouldn't be surprised
they sent you.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.744
You're with the asset?

13:53.658 --> 13:55.182
Yes.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.010
Break her out.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.056
How...

14:00.100 --> 14:02.145
how do I...

14:02.189 --> 14:04.452
Do what you always do.
Improvise.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.542
Otherwise, everyone in
the safe house will be killed,

14:07.585 --> 14:09.196
followed by the hostages.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.198
Five minutes.

14:22.296 --> 14:25.429
There's a reason
we keep meeting.

14:25.473 --> 14:28.737
A reason I told you that story.
Do you see it?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.086
It's fate.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.219
No matter what you
do or don't do,

14:32.262 --> 14:34.786
how pure your intentions
are or aren't,

14:34.830 --> 14:38.268
at the end of the day,
you're at the mercy of fate.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.836
And, Dwayne.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.840
Fate's a bitch.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.712
Shut up.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.541
I didn't say a word.

14:50.585 --> 14:51.673
I wasn't talking to you!

14:53.805 --> 14:55.938
Just spoke with my supervisor.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.679
You're not authorized
to be here.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.768
I can explain.Do it on the way out.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.945
:
I know this is hard
to understand...

15:02.989 --> 15:04.512
but...

15:06.296 --> 15:08.820
I need to bring her with me.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.953
REYNOLDS: That's insane.
This woman tried to kill you.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.824
Do you understand how much
trouble we're both in right now?

15:12.868 --> 15:15.958
Lives are on the line.And you're going, by
choice or by force.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.481
Conversation over.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.620
Okay.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.056
You're right,
I'm s... I'm sorry.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.538
Let's go.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.715
Everyone's nerves are frayed.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.847
Yeah.And I know you have

15:35.891 --> 15:37.719
a beef with her, but this
thing is bigger than...

15:46.946 --> 15:49.818
Just so I'm clear...

15:49.861 --> 15:51.907
are you killing me,
or are you breaking me out?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.431
Breaking you out.

15:56.433 --> 16:00.133
Then you'll find the keys to
the cuffs in his right pocket.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.569
And a knife

16:01.612 --> 16:02.962
in his boot, too,

16:03.005 --> 16:05.007
if that's
your thing.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.972
You make one move...

16:13.015 --> 16:14.843
And you shoot me.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.540
I get it.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.984
:
You have the asset?I have Amelia Parsons,

16:25.027 --> 16:27.073
and a team of CIA agents
right behind me.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.466
At the end of the street,
you'll see the van.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.686
Deliver Amelia.
Your mission will be complete.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.601
I need the hostages released.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.255
Deliver Amelia,
and they will be.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.734
Wait!NCIS! Freeze!

16:39.302 --> 16:40.651
PRIDE:
No!

16:42.305 --> 16:43.785
No!Amelia!

16:43.828 --> 16:45.830
Down on the ground!
I will shoot you!

16:45.874 --> 16:48.659
What just happened?No, just hang on.
Just give me a moment.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.183
Christopher, you
need to stand down.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.707
Pride, we know you've been
compromised. We got you now.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.100
No. You're gonna
have to let me go.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.319
This is about Wade
and your father.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.712
Three other hostages, too.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.714
Look, I don't have
time to explain.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.368
We'll figure it out
back at NCIS.

17:01.411 --> 17:02.543
I can't!King!

17:04.414 --> 17:07.765
If this is your play,
we'll back it.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.898
PRIDE:
Okay.

17:09.941 --> 17:12.248
Yeah. Make sure that
Laurel's protected.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.207
Rita and Jimmy, too.Hey, already taken care of.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.817
Thank you. Come on.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.170
How are we supposed
to help him now?

17:21.214 --> 17:23.651
Figure out where
these guys came from.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.485
And who's giving them orders.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.835
REYNOLDS:
Hands where we can see 'em!

17:33.878 --> 17:35.097
Now!

17:35.141 --> 17:37.404
First we got to talk
our way out of this.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.367
PRIDE:
Come on.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.673
Talk to me.

17:45.716 --> 17:46.935
Where are you?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.416
You screwed up, Pride.

17:49.459 --> 17:50.939
I did everything you asked.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.462
Your agents were there.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.247
Because you killed
a state trooper.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.684
But I have Amelia.
We can make a deal.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.338
No one else has to die.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.731
Did you hear me?

18:00.775 --> 18:01.863
Hello?

18:01.906 --> 18:03.517
Damn it!

18:03.560 --> 18:04.692
Hey.

18:04.735 --> 18:05.867
Who are you talking to?

18:05.910 --> 18:07.347
Your friend.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.305
I don't have any friends.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.352
I was forced to break you out
of a CIA safe house.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.354
And you're gonna tell me why.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.098
SEBASTIAN:
You let Pride and Amelia go?

18:19.141 --> 18:20.534
HANNAH:
Yeah, we had to, Sebastian.

18:20.577 --> 18:23.014
These guys abducted
Dr. Wade and Cassius.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.756
Three other hostages, too.
Only way to keep them alive.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.193
Amelia's behind
this, right?

18:27.236 --> 18:28.890
HANNAH:
Yeah, looks like it.Wait, I mean,

18:28.933 --> 18:31.197
she was in a federal prison--
how did she get transferred?

18:31.240 --> 18:34.330
She was cooperating with the CIA
on something called Apollyon.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.375
What's Apollyon?

18:35.418 --> 18:36.550
They won't tell us.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.117
CIA's got their
panties in a bunch

18:38.160 --> 18:39.422
because we let
their asset escape.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.076
Yeah, well, they got a point.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.730
Pride's alone with the woman
who almost killed him,

18:42.773 --> 18:43.905
and we don't know where.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.950
You know what?
I did get one thing.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.561
Got this from the gunman.

18:47.604 --> 18:48.953
Looks like they're communicating

18:48.997 --> 18:50.607
with whoever's running
this thing.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.261
All right, maybe Patton
can trace the signal,

18:52.305 --> 18:53.610
figure out where
the hostages are.

18:53.654 --> 18:54.916
Yeah, we need
to figure out

18:54.959 --> 18:56.570
what this Apollyon is.Yeah.

18:56.613 --> 18:57.875
All right, well,
just get back here,

18:57.919 --> 18:59.050
because every second
that passes,

18:59.094 --> 19:00.139
someone else could die.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.495
What are they doing?

19:08.538 --> 19:09.974
Shh.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.759
They're arguing out there.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.891
Can you hear
what they're saying?No.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.850
But I'm sure that
Dwayne pissed them off

19:15.893 --> 19:17.721
in some way.Well, I'm pissed off, too.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.332
Dragged me out of
my house last night

19:19.375 --> 19:21.290
with a gun to my head--
you want to tell me why?

19:21.334 --> 19:23.336
Why do you assume
that I know?

19:23.379 --> 19:25.990
Because you were kidnapped twice
in as many months.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.731
What did you do, Cassius?

19:27.775 --> 19:29.820
I have been in Kentucky

19:29.864 --> 19:32.606
living a life
of peaceful contemplation.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.695
I don't believe you.Well, you could ask the marshal

19:34.738 --> 19:38.002
who's been watching me 24/7,
but unfortunately, he's dead.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.743
Loretta,

19:39.787 --> 19:42.790
I swear to you
this is not about me.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.838
Get up. You're
coming with me.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.927
Now, hold on, if you want
to take somebody, take me.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.496
All right, I'll go.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.845
Tie him up.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.891
Shoot him if he moves.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.460
20 years ago,

20:00.503 --> 20:01.678
I'd have kicked your ass.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.507
Stop!

20:04.551 --> 20:06.248
We're cooperating.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.163
Let's just get it over with.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.661
♪

20:41.936 --> 20:44.373
I know what you're
thinking, Dwayne.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.897
It's bold. Can you commit?

20:46.941 --> 20:49.552
I'll do what I have to.Sure,

20:49.596 --> 20:53.077
and-and I admire it,
but what if there's
nothing you cando?

20:55.036 --> 20:57.386
You getting the theme here?

21:07.570 --> 21:10.921
You've been waiting
for this, right?

21:12.749 --> 21:15.361
You're gonna tell me where
the hostages are being held.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.798
Just the two of us...

21:17.841 --> 21:20.670
where no one
can hear me scream?

21:22.759 --> 21:25.675
You're gonna tell me the names
of the men you're working with.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.895
Is this what it was like
before you killed my husband?

21:27.938 --> 21:29.723
This is what it's
like when I'm...

21:29.766 --> 21:31.333
protecting my own.

21:32.726 --> 21:35.468
You will not touch Amelia.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.819
You will listen to me
very closely

21:38.862 --> 21:40.777
and watch the screen.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.260
Wait.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.261
Wait, don't!

21:46.305 --> 21:47.393
Quiet.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.090
You didn't follow instructions.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.396
Margaret?

21:51.527 --> 21:53.137
No.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.319
No!

22:00.362 --> 22:02.016
You know what I want, Amelia.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.845
You have 30 minutes.

22:07.804 --> 22:11.155
Who are those people?

22:11.199 --> 22:14.637
My sister and her family.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.815
You're not behind this.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
They're using you, too.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.497
We need to go now.
Uncuff me.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.195
First tell me who these men
are and what they want.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.893
They're Apollyon.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.069
And what is Apollyon?

22:55.112 --> 22:57.506
A private intelligence firm.
You name it, Apollyon does it.

22:57.550 --> 22:58.942
I've never heard of them.No one has.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.467
That's the point.
We work in the shadows,

23:01.510 --> 23:02.903
and we do the jobs
no one else will.

23:02.946 --> 23:05.079
And then we disappear.We?

23:05.122 --> 23:07.473
All former intelligence
and special forces.

23:07.516 --> 23:10.519
Now, please, let's go.No. You have something
that they want.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.393
Proof they exist.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.177
All personnel files.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.092
Operation logs.

23:18.135 --> 23:20.094
It's my insurance policy.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.096
That's what you were
trading with the CIA.

23:22.139 --> 23:26.056
But Apollyon figured it out,
and they want their files back.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.668
Now that we're all caught up,
can you drive?

23:28.711 --> 23:29.973
I need names and locations.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.410
Everything is in the files,

23:31.453 --> 23:33.281
which I will take you to now.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.849
Tell me where they are.So you can leave me behind?

23:35.892 --> 23:37.590
No.

23:37.633 --> 23:40.593
I just watched
my brother-in-law get murdered.

23:40.636 --> 23:44.466
I need to help my family.
And you need to help yours.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.468
Let me be clear here.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.035
I don't trust you.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.907
I don't trust you, either.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.909
So...

23:57.827 --> 23:59.873
What do we know?LASALLE:
Nothing.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.962
Can't find the van that Pride
and Amelia took anywhere.

24:02.005 --> 24:05.139
And the two gunmen you shot
have scrubbed aliases. No idea

24:05.182 --> 24:06.923
who they really are.LASALLE:
Please tell me you got something

24:06.967 --> 24:08.403
that can help from the CIA.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.535
They're not really
in a giving vain

24:09.578 --> 24:10.884
since Pride ran off with Amelia.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.929
We're on our own.

24:12.973 --> 24:14.322
Well, luckily,
we thrive on our own.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.541
Patton got something big.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.238
I was able to hack
into the signal

24:17.281 --> 24:18.587
from the earwig
you brought back.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.067
Can you track where
it's coming from?

24:20.110 --> 24:21.721
Not yet.
But I can piggyback on it

24:21.764 --> 24:23.113
and connect to Pride.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.158
Let's do it.GREGORIO: Yeah.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.599
How much farther, Amelia?

24:30.643 --> 24:32.775
Close. Stay on this road

24:32.819 --> 24:34.603
for three more miles,
then turn left.

24:34.647 --> 24:36.083
If you could
just give me a sense

24:36.126 --> 24:37.606
of where you've hidden
these files...

24:37.650 --> 24:39.347
Just keep driving.

24:39.390 --> 24:40.957
PATTON :
Pride, you there?

24:41.001 --> 24:42.611
Patton? How did you...

24:42.655 --> 24:43.569
I do what I do.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.179
Okay, I interrupted the signal.

24:45.222 --> 24:46.789
We're linked
into your comms now.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.182
No one else can hear us.

24:48.225 --> 24:50.271
Can you track
the suspects' location?

24:50.314 --> 24:52.360
Yeah, we're working on it.Where are you, Pride?

24:52.403 --> 24:53.622
PRIDE:
East of the city.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.537
Get more specific.
We'll find you.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.540
Apollyon's watching
every move I make.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.977
They see NCIS
anywhere near me again...

25:01.021 --> 25:03.632
Hostages die. All right,

25:03.676 --> 25:05.547
what do they want?PRIDE: Amelia has data

25:05.591 --> 25:08.158
on Apollyon's activities,
and they want it back.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.813
We're dealing with highly
trained former operatives here.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.554
HANNAH:
Yeah, not all former.

25:12.598 --> 25:15.122
These people knew they'd taken
Amelia back to that safe house.

25:15.165 --> 25:18.038
They also knew Cassius was
in WITSEC and where to find him.

25:18.081 --> 25:19.300
Yeah, suggests someone
on the inside

25:19.343 --> 25:20.910
with access to sensitive intel.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.216
It's a starting point.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.218
Track that communication signal.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.002
Find out where they're holding
Loretta and Cassius.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.351
What are you gonna do?

25:27.395 --> 25:29.049
Play this out as long as I can.

25:29.092 --> 25:32.095
While you find out
who Apollyon is

25:32.139 --> 25:34.010
and where they're hiding.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.925
And we need radio silence.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.666
Can't let on
that we're in contact.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.538
So, wait,
you're gonna be out there alone

25:39.581 --> 25:41.540
with the woman
who tried to kill you?

25:44.760 --> 25:47.937
Don't worry about me.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.909
Sit down.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.614
Are you all right?

26:12.658 --> 26:16.139
I just witnessed
a man being executed.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.577
But you'reall right?

26:18.620 --> 26:21.884
Under the circumstances, sure.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.886
Mm, yeah.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.501
You seem awfully pleased
with yourself.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.593
Did Dwayne ever tell you
about my childhood?

26:34.636 --> 26:37.073
We were poor.

26:37.117 --> 26:40.337
I mean, no food in
the cupboards poor.

26:40.381 --> 26:43.384
I had to take care of myself
'cause my parents couldn't.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.255
So I learned to...

26:45.299 --> 26:48.607
to pick a pocket
before the age of ten.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.958
Served me well all these years.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.655
Am I supposed to be impressed
with that?

26:53.699 --> 26:55.439
Maybe grateful

26:55.483 --> 26:57.528
to your rescuer.

26:57.572 --> 27:00.270
I think you overestimate

27:00.314 --> 27:03.056
the value of a knife
in a gunfight.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.625
Well, we're on our own now.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.801
We have to work
off our instincts.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.280
Lucky for you,

27:10.324 --> 27:11.891
I've always been a survivor.

27:16.547 --> 27:19.289
PRIDE: You hid the files
in a graveyard?

27:19.333 --> 27:20.943
This is where
I buried my husband.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.989
If we had time,
we could visit him.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.470
We're going
to the caretaker's building.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.647
Files are buried in the wall.
We'll have to break it open.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.126
There's no "we."

27:30.170 --> 27:33.521
By all rights
you should be here.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.479
I shot you three times.
You were dead.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.046
Could say the same about you.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.048
'Cause we arethe same, Pride.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.877
Born killers who won't quit.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.139
We're nothing alike.

27:43.183 --> 27:46.229
:
Don't act superior.

27:46.273 --> 27:49.102
You make excuses
for the lives you take. I don't.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.843
Because you're a sociopath.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.541
Because I'm honest.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.152
We've both looked Death
in the face, Pride.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.417
You know what I saw?

28:00.461 --> 28:03.029
I saw myself.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.336
What about you?

28:27.096 --> 28:29.098
Wait here.

28:42.068 --> 28:45.027
I like her. She's good for you.

28:46.899 --> 28:49.379
Aside from the fact
she wants to kill you.

28:49.423 --> 28:51.207
She gives you perspective.

28:51.251 --> 28:53.862
And you're going to give
her a sledgehammer?

28:53.906 --> 28:55.559
I don't have a choice.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.736
That's the whole point
of your story, isn't it?

28:57.779 --> 29:01.870
The point is
to get your head on straight.

29:01.914 --> 29:05.395
You're not in control.
You never will be.

29:05.439 --> 29:08.181
Do you have something
actually practical to share?

29:08.224 --> 29:10.444
Some insight?

29:10.487 --> 29:13.490
A premonition

29:14.796 --> 29:16.755
I'm really just here
for moral support.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.062
And you're gonna need it.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.115
Stop. Stop.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.433
It's locked.

29:43.477 --> 29:46.262
Needs my thumbprint to open.
But I wouldn't.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.440
Time's up.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.486
You have the package?

29:54.488 --> 29:56.751
Yes, we have the package.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.797
Amelia will bring it out.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.799
My people are waiting.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.030
No masks this time.I noticed.

30:17.163 --> 30:18.947
Bring him the case.

30:37.357 --> 30:39.011
Unlock it for him.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.732
Amelia, you don't need to...

31:19.529 --> 31:21.880
Is this what we're doing?

31:21.923 --> 31:23.533
You set up an ambush?

31:23.577 --> 31:26.710
Sacrifice your own family
just to settle a score

31:26.754 --> 31:28.321
with me?No.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.323
They were gonna kill us anyway.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.934
Do you even have
the Apollyon data?

31:32.978 --> 31:35.589
I've had it the whole time.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.592
On me.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.464
A tattoo?

31:41.508 --> 31:44.728
Scan the barcode.
Files download.

31:44.772 --> 31:45.947
Clever.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.471
Put the gun down.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.473
I don't want to
kill you, Pride.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.084
Not now.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.825
I need you
to get my family back.

31:54.869 --> 31:57.219
You just shot the only people
who could help you do that.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.136
That one's still alive.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.965
Won't be for long
if we don't stop the bleeding.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.027
Pressure on the wound.

32:25.508 --> 32:26.988
Is the mission a success?
Repeat.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.469
Is the mission a success?

32:29.512 --> 32:30.905
Beta Team. Are you there?

32:32.907 --> 32:35.301
Your boss wants a sitrep.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.172
All right? You're
gonna tell him

32:37.216 --> 32:38.521
the mission was a success.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.219
Mm-mm.Yes, you are.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.701
Stop that.

32:44.745 --> 32:45.876
Stop it.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.361
Listen.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.450
You're gonna tell him
it was a success

32:54.494 --> 32:58.106
or I'm gonna let her
compel you to do it.

32:58.150 --> 33:00.979
Okay. Okay.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.633
Okay.

33:07.768 --> 33:11.119
This is Beta Leader.

33:11.163 --> 33:14.079
Mission complete.

33:14.122 --> 33:17.212
We have Amelia and the package.

33:17.256 --> 33:19.388
Pride's dead.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.216
Copy, Beta Leader.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.739
Return to base.

33:22.783 --> 33:25.829
Copy. Returning to base.

33:28.658 --> 33:29.746
Hey.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.053
I need to know
where base is.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.055
Hey.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.057
He lost too much blood.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.233
PATTON: Pride, are you there?
Are you okay?

33:38.277 --> 33:39.582
I'm fine, P.

33:39.626 --> 33:40.801
You hear any of that?

33:40.844 --> 33:41.976
We heard it all.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.369
Please tell me
you traced the signal.

33:43.412 --> 33:44.892
SEBASTIAN:
Well, it hasn't been easy.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.981
Suspects set up a closed
communication system

33:47.025 --> 33:49.462
with advanced encryption
and a regulated kill switch.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.333
Every time the comms turn off,

33:51.377 --> 33:52.769
the links dry up.SEBASTIAN: Yeah, it means

33:52.813 --> 33:54.162
we have to wait for it
to go back online

33:54.206 --> 33:55.511
before we can try again.

33:55.555 --> 33:56.860
That's not what I needed
to hear.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.297
PATTON:
Hold on, though. Sebastian and I

33:58.340 --> 34:00.081
have figured out a way
to beat the system.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.909
Yeah. We designed a virus
that attaches itself

34:01.952 --> 34:03.824
to the signal and forces it
to stay open.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.695
PATTON: At least long enough to
know where it's coming from.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.349
That mean you got a location?

34:07.393 --> 34:09.612
Zeroing in on it now.PRIDE: All right, good work.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.136
We just might have a chance...

34:11.179 --> 34:12.180
SEBASTIAN:
Pride?

34:16.750 --> 34:18.621
What the hell did you just do?

34:18.665 --> 34:20.188
Are you some kind of an animal?

34:20.232 --> 34:22.060
You just kill on a whim?

34:22.103 --> 34:23.061
No!

34:23.104 --> 34:24.888
Do you hear me?

34:26.325 --> 34:28.370
He was gonna die anyway.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.511
Patton tracked the location

34:38.554 --> 34:40.513
of the suspect's
communication signal.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.297
LASALLE:
It's the old Kenworth
Electrical Factory.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.778
Been derelict for years.

34:44.821 --> 34:47.128
SEBASTIAN:
Pride and Amelia are on their
way but they're gonna need help.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.609
Place is a maze. Bad guys could
be anywhere. Hostages, too.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.350
Well, we're gonna access
real-time satellite imagery
from here.

34:51.393 --> 34:52.829
We're gonna be your
eyes in the sky.HANNAH: Thanks.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.309
I just spoke to ASAC Thompson.

34:54.353 --> 34:55.876
He's activated the REACT Unit.

34:55.919 --> 34:57.617
They'll support us.All right, we got to go now.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.141
Make sure Pride and those
hostages get out alive.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.186
Hey, guys...Sebastian, don't worry.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.405
We're gonna get Loretta back.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.330
They think I'm dead
and you're captured.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.158
They'll figure it
out soon enough.

35:17.202 --> 35:20.118
Then we need to move fast
and find our people.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.734
Give me a weapon.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.085
You need me armed.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.480
PATTON: Team's ten minutes out
if you can wait.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.656
Waiting's not an option.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.571
SEBASTIAN: Well, we got access
to thermal imagery.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.225
We can see you in
the northwest corner.

35:40.268 --> 35:42.357
Rest of the heat signatures are
on the east end of the factory.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.011
There's a lot of them.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.230
Hostages and suspects.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.623
Copy that, Patton.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.901
Something's happening out there.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.121
They're coming
for us, Cassius.
Yes.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.427
And when they do,
you stay out of the way.

36:08.470 --> 36:09.471
I'll bum-rush them.

36:09.515 --> 36:10.690
What will that accomplish,

36:10.733 --> 36:12.082
other than you
getting shot sooner?

36:12.126 --> 36:13.475
It'll help you to run.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.824
What?

36:14.868 --> 36:16.304
Chivalry doesn't suit you.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.958
It's self-preservation.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.395
Anything happens to you,
Dwayne will kill me.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.404
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's me, Dwayne.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.319
Loretta.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.234
You okay?
Much better now.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.888
I'm okay, too, kid.
Not that you're asking.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.237
I need you to get her
out of here, okay?

36:36.281 --> 36:37.673
Hey, aren't you
coming with us?

36:37.717 --> 36:40.110
No, Amelia and I are gonna find
the other hostages.

36:40.154 --> 36:41.416
Not sure she knows
about the plan.

36:42.374 --> 36:43.375
What?

36:47.770 --> 36:51.209
All right, look. Just...
get Loretta out of here.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.819
Now! That way!

36:55.169 --> 36:59.129
Patton. I need to know
where Amelia went.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.522
PATTON:
It looks like she's upstairs.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.132
There's multiple
heat signatures there.

37:03.612 --> 37:05.092
Patton?

37:05.135 --> 37:07.268
MAN:
He's gone.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.227
You think you're in control
but you're not.

37:09.270 --> 37:10.924
I know you killed Beta Team.

37:10.967 --> 37:14.884
Wait.I've watched every move
you've made.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.146
And the result is the same.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.757
We've got what you want.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.239
You think very carefully
about your next move.

37:21.282 --> 37:22.892
The moment Wade and your father

37:22.936 --> 37:25.373
leave this compound,
they'll be shot.

37:25.417 --> 37:29.595
If your team tries to help them,
they'll be shot.

37:30.422 --> 37:33.120
Let them live.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.904
You can have me.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.167
I already have you.

37:37.211 --> 37:39.953
Step around the corner
and turn yourself over.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.832
I'm sure you've heard the story
Appointment in Samarra?

37:49.876 --> 37:52.008
Wait. Wha...?

37:52.052 --> 37:53.401
How did...?

37:53.445 --> 37:55.360
You're the merchant.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.971
I'm Death.

38:07.415 --> 38:08.677
MAN:
This should have been simple.

38:08.721 --> 38:11.201
A lot of lives would
have been saved.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.073
You were always gonna kill us.

38:13.116 --> 38:15.510
I was always going to kill you.

38:15.554 --> 38:17.077
Put your weapon down.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.731
Give my man the package.

38:18.774 --> 38:21.864
Whatever he's saying,
don't do a damn thing

38:21.908 --> 38:23.692
until my family is released.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.086
MAN: You still have time to save
some of these people...

38:26.129 --> 38:27.827
but not much.

38:29.916 --> 38:31.439
Spread out.
Secure the perimeter.

38:35.225 --> 38:37.924
Patton lost contact
with Pride.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.491
No sign of Wade
and Cassius.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.232
HANNAH:
I got 'em.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.453
I see them, let's go.

38:45.497 --> 38:46.889
No. No. Too easy.

38:46.933 --> 38:48.848
Nothing about this
has been easy.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.328
Listen. You run,
fast as you can.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.938
I will cover you,
then I'll follow.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.505
Cassius, I...For once in your life,

38:53.548 --> 38:54.854
don't have the last word.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.334
Now, go. Go.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.991
SNIPER:
I've got Wade in my sites.

39:02.035 --> 39:04.603
I've got you in mine.
Finger off the trigger.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.129
Sniper team secured.

39:15.483 --> 39:16.658
You're safe, Loretta.

39:16.702 --> 39:17.703
Where's Cassius?

39:19.574 --> 39:21.663
He was right behind me.

39:27.016 --> 39:29.584
Take the damn shot already!

39:29.628 --> 39:31.934
MAN:
The blood will be on your hands.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.459
Accept the situation, Pride.

39:34.502 --> 39:37.331
Okay.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.642
I'm putting the weapon down.

39:48.951 --> 39:49.996
Kick it.

39:52.215 --> 39:53.695
You're useless.

40:11.060 --> 40:13.193
Why the hell did you come back?

40:13.236 --> 40:14.586
My son was in trouble.

40:14.629 --> 40:16.849
You got a problem
with that?

40:16.892 --> 40:18.590
You're welcome, by the way.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.549
Make sure they're all right.

40:21.593 --> 40:23.333
PATTON:
Pride. You hear me?

40:23.377 --> 40:25.814
REACT Team is in the factory,
they're on their way.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.077
There's a door behind you,
that's the source of the signal.

40:28.121 --> 40:30.253
All right. I'm sending the
hostages out to you now.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.693
All right. Get down the stairs
and keep moving.

40:34.736 --> 40:37.565
Don't worry about her.
I'll take care of her.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.319
Your turn to accept
the situation.

40:52.362 --> 40:55.409
Your men are down.
You're done.

40:57.019 --> 41:00.327
MAN:
Door's not locked. Come in.

41:00.370 --> 41:01.415
Careful, kid.

41:08.117 --> 41:09.162
Time's up, Dwayne.

41:09.205 --> 41:10.859
Wha...?

41:10.903 --> 41:12.382
I'm so sorry.

41:12.426 --> 41:14.733
AMELIA: Pride.What?

41:18.214 --> 41:19.259
No!

41:30.618 --> 41:32.533
Cassius. Hey, Cassius.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.536
Hey. Come on. Now.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.146
Hang in there. I got ya.

41:37.190 --> 41:40.541
Cassius. Cassius.

41:40.585 --> 41:43.457
Dad. Please.

41:49.637 --> 41:53.554
"As I am now,
so soon you'll be.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.948
"Prepare for death,

41:55.991 --> 41:58.428
and follow me."
