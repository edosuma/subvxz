WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:04.921
Chili's gonna be our
new paramedic-in-charge
on Ambulance 61.

00:05.172 --> 00:08.132
I'm developing a new product
for the adult
beverage market. Chilleeze.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.259
You got something here, kid.

00:10.594 --> 00:13.763
You do construction, great.
You flirt with the
girls, I don't give a damn.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.516
But don't come
looking for me back there.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.685
Do me a favor, Jack.
Piss off.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.020
Did you notice anything about
Rice in that last fire?

00:21.105 --> 00:23.481
He was running out when
everyone else was
running in.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.901
You've been spreading rumors
about Rice since the first day
he set foot in this house.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.779
Severide, look...
I hear it again, we're
gonna have a problem.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.867
Wow. Look at that hustle.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.704
First shift always leaves
this thing a mess, so.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.331
Oh, great. Glad you're here,
I wanted to talk to you.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.457
Yeah, what's up?

00:41.542 --> 00:42.792
Um,

00:45.295 --> 00:46.587
everything okay here?

00:47.464 --> 00:50.633
Sure, yeah. Can't tell you
how grateful I am.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.011
I mean, being back to work
fulltime is a little tricky
with Logan,

00:54.096 --> 00:55.471
but, yeah, he's adjusting.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.891
Hey. Check this out.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.979
He wrote a list of things
he wants to do for
his fifth birthday.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.981
Regular stuff, you know,
Navy Pier, LEGO Store,

01:05.065 --> 01:08.317
but, uh, look at what
he wrote up top there.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.029
Okay. "Go to Benihana
with Uncle Kelly."

01:12.614 --> 01:14.407
He always talks about
that time we took him there.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.409
You guys cooking
in from of him.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.493
Yeah.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.830
Hey. Benihana it is.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.498
All right.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.591
I've always wanted to try
that stuff.

01:31.675 --> 01:35.011
Look at that color.
I can see why they call it
nectar of the gods.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.763
We gotta taste it, right?

01:36.847 --> 01:39.056
Drinking on shift, Cruz?
Great idea.

01:39.141 --> 01:42.393
Not drinking tasting.
One drop.

01:42.478 --> 01:43.603
One drop each.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.897
Well, then there's the issue
of it not belonging to us.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.733
Hey, better to ask forgiveness
than permission, am I right?

01:51.361 --> 01:54.071
Hey. Is that Olde
Rumpelstiltskin twenty?

01:54.990 --> 01:57.909
Yeah, huh.
Who brought that in?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.329
Um. It's for you, actually.

02:01.413 --> 02:05.124
Um, it's from Jack Nesbitt,
says "many apologies."

02:08.295 --> 02:09.295
That the strip club guy?

02:09.379 --> 02:10.463
What happened?

02:10.547 --> 02:13.758
Difference of opinion.
I'm done with Stilettos.

02:19.223 --> 02:22.391
Hm. Ha-ha!

02:30.651 --> 02:33.569
That shower was the greatest
thing that's ever happened
to me.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.405
Who was in there with you?

02:36.490 --> 02:39.075
The true love of my
life hot water.

02:40.035 --> 02:40.993
None at home?

02:41.078 --> 02:43.329
Uh, no, it got turned off.
I didn't pay my bill on time.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.291
Chilleez is soaking up all
my funds.

02:49.753 --> 02:53.422
Hey, if you're not a
risk taker, you should get the
hell out of business, right?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.842
Um, hey if you need
to borrow some.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.846
No! No way.
I got this.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.645
So I look it up,
and actually by law,
it turns out

03:07.729 --> 03:10.147
that bourbon has to be
at least 51 percent corn.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.482
Now the rest of it
can be rye or barley.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.568
Hey Otis, I need to
change out a blade.

03:13.944 --> 03:14.902
Sure, hang on.

03:14.987 --> 03:18.281
Now in wheated bourbons,
wheat replaces the rye.
Or the barley.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.867
Hey guys, we just got
a new shipment
of air bags in,

03:20.951 --> 03:22.034
let's roll 'em out,
give 'em a try.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.077
Come on.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.454
Whoops.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.628
Ah, Lieutenant, Sergeant
Voight is on the phone
for you.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.381
What does he want?

03:35.465 --> 03:36.549
He didn't say.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.553
Ambulance 61, Truck 81.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.679
Tell Voight to go fu...

03:41.763 --> 03:42.805
Ah. I got you.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.557
River Road
and 23rd.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.240
My brother he went over
the edge! He's not moving!

04:01.325 --> 04:02.325
What's his name?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.618
Justin.

04:15.964 --> 04:19.717
Justin! Can you hear me,
Justin?

04:20.844 --> 04:21.969
Lotta blood.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.763
He's nonresponsive.
How far is Squad?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.389
Mile or two away.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.893
I don't think we can
wait, Chief. Let us rope
down there, use our rigging.

04:29.186 --> 04:33.481
Do it. Squad 3 hold
off. 81's gonna rope
down to the victim.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.526
Chief, we're gonna
be there in no time.
Tell Casey to sit tight.

04:37.611 --> 04:43.199
Negative, Squad. He could be
bleeding out. No time to wait.
81's got this one.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.494
A rope rescue,
and Truck has it?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.080
You want me to head
back to quarters?

04:49.164 --> 04:50.873
No, screw that, keep going.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.885
Okay, slow.
Nice and easy.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.909
He's breathing!
Left pupil's blown,

05:26.994 --> 05:30.162
possible back
and neck injury.
Gash on his forehead.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.004
Let's buckle him up.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.144
Hey Chief.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.021
Told you to stand by,
Squad.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.189
We were a block away.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.608
Okay! Bring 'em up!

06:00.444 --> 06:01.819
Pull her up.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.332
Stop pulling!

06:15.417 --> 06:16.625
Whoa!

06:17.502 --> 06:19.253
Hey, got it, we
got it! Back off!

06:25.677 --> 06:26.761
We're good.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.304
Okay, bring 'em up!

06:43.820 --> 06:44.779
He's up.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.113
Whoa!

06:46.531 --> 06:48.407
Set him on
the guard rail.
I'll get him off line.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.246
Okay.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.217
All right.
He has a head injury,
we need to Trauma bypass.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.263
What's with the attitude
from Truck?

07:12.224 --> 07:14.433
They got here first,
got a little souped up.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.646
I don't know. I mean the way
lines are blurred between
Truck and Squad around here,

07:18.730 --> 07:20.981
no one would guess that
Squad 3 is one of the elite

07:21.066 --> 07:22.942
firefighting units in
this whole city.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.527
I mean hell,
those guys don't even respect

07:24.611 --> 07:26.278
the sanctity of
the Squad table.

07:32.911 --> 07:37.206
Okay, kiddo. I'm here to
Captain this ship right
to the sea of success.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.666
Let's talk about "next steps."

07:38.750 --> 07:43.045
Okay great! Uh, I had
a friend, he's an artist,
he drew up some sketches

07:43.130 --> 07:45.172
for the uh, Chilleez logo.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.883
This guy's an artist like
a real one?

07:48.593 --> 07:49.802
Yeah he can draw.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.013
Sort of.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.642
Chili, this is real amateur
hour stuff. All right.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.895
You need to have a
proper mock up. You gotta
hire a professional.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.233
Yeah I know, I was
just trying to save myself a
couple thousand dollars.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.652
You can't put
a price on success.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.905
Yeah, you're right.
Thanks, Cap'n.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.616
Otis.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.160
Hey, what's up.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.705
Whatever your feelings
about Scott Rice, he's not
just a good friend of mine,

08:17.789 --> 08:19.748
he's a highly trained
member of Rescue Squad.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.333
You need to
treat him with some respect.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.169
You got it?

08:23.420 --> 08:24.753
Yeah. Got it.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.798
Good. That goes for everyone
else on Truck.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.638
And don't sit at the
damn Squad table.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.400
Anything you two
want to tell me?

08:49.487 --> 08:51.280
Okay. Let's go.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.783
Outside.

09:07.631 --> 09:11.300
Rice's mask malfunctions once
and you decide he's a ducker.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.886
Because I couldn't find
anything wrong with his
regulator!

09:14.012 --> 09:16.764
Which begs the question,
why are you snooping
around his gear?

09:16.932 --> 09:19.225
Look, it's not just the
mask, Casey. There's also
the time he went back

09:19.309 --> 09:20.392
for his Denver bar.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.604
Oh, right, yeah, I almost
forgot the Denver bar.
That clinches it.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.774
Lieutenant, I, I don't think
we're overreacting here.
What I do think

09:26.942 --> 09:29.610
is Severide is being
blinded by his friendship
with that guy.

09:29.694 --> 09:34.573
You guys can't go around
talking smack about a member
of Severide's team and

09:34.658 --> 09:37.993
not expect him
to tear you a new one.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.829
I don't want to hear
another word, got it?

09:43.166 --> 09:44.500
We got it, Lieutenant.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.004
Casey, Sergeant Voight
wants to talk to you.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.924
Not interested.
Tell him to stop calling.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.218
He's not on the phone
this time.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.026
You got 30 seconds.

10:15.824 --> 10:23.289
Listen. Your buddy over at
the strip club, Jack Nesbitt.
He's into some nasty business.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.417
We need a man on the inside.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.129
I think you could be that man.

10:31.047 --> 10:35.384
Sorry, I'm out of
the Nesbitt business.
I'm not going back.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.136
Casey.

10:37.220 --> 10:41.056
I'm sure as hell not
in the Voight business.
Never will be.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.906
Whatever I said,
it was in jest.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.575
We need to talk to
you about Chili.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.661
Did you know she's put
every penny she's got
into this Chilleez idea?

11:03.705 --> 11:07.374
Look she respects you,
so we were hoping,
maybe instead of letting her

11:07.459 --> 11:10.377
put all her money into that
new logo, you could get her
to slow down.

11:11.254 --> 11:16.675
"Slow down"? You think that's
the advice Mark Cuban
gives his contestants on

11:16.760 --> 11:17.926
Shark Tank?

11:18.428 --> 11:22.222
I literally have no idea,
but...
You think Sir Richard Branson

11:22.307 --> 11:25.309
says every morning,
"Oh, I better slow down"?

11:25.393 --> 11:29.730
The answer is no, he says
"how much faster can I go?"

11:29.898 --> 11:31.565
Chili is not a billionaire,
Herrmann.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.651
And neither were those two
before they struck gold!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.947
Do you have any
idea who Chili
reminds me of?

11:40.325 --> 11:42.284
A young Christopher Herrmann.

11:42.452 --> 11:48.123
Big ideas, bright horizons.
The last thing I'm gonna do
is stand in that kid's way.

11:49.751 --> 11:54.129
Sorry guys, one sec. Hey.
Antonio, can I hit you
back in a few?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.009
'Course, yeah, what's wrong?

12:08.645 --> 12:09.645
Everything okay?

12:10.105 --> 12:11.313
Yeah.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.863
Um. I just got off
the phone with Antonio.

12:19.948 --> 12:24.660
He told me the guy, uh,
Nesbitt, who you used to
work for, is pretty bad news.

12:25.829 --> 12:26.829
Yeah.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.998
I talked to Voight
about this.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.378
I'm coming to you on
behalf of Antonio.
Not Voight.

12:34.963 --> 12:35.963
Look,

12:36.339 --> 12:40.300
I know some of
these clubs get shady with
the books, but I didn't...

12:40.427 --> 12:42.761
They're trafficking girls,
Matt.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.389
Jack Nesbitt?

12:45.473 --> 12:49.226
He works under a ring
of guys who are
smuggling in young women from

12:49.310 --> 12:52.855
Eastern Europe and they funnel
them in to work at the club,
force them into prostitution.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.358
Damn it.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.945
Antonio says that they're
really slick. CPD can't
even get close enough to

13:00.029 --> 13:01.196
gather any intel.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.407
But what they hear is
that Nesbitt trusts you.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.371
Antonio knows it's a big
ask, especially considering
your history with Voight.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.374
But right now,
you're their best shot.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.173
I'm gonna say hook shot.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.716
Right here.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.178
Whoa.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.347
Come on, Mouch.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.559
Aww. That's an "R" for
Mouch!

13:31.728 --> 13:35.689
Watch it. Hey, you guys mind?
We're doing drills over here.

13:37.108 --> 13:40.611
Yeah guys there's serious men
doing serious work over there.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.321
All right Capp, watch...
Watch the victim's head.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.697
Tony, you got his body weight.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.075
Aww, how perfect is it
that Rice is playing the
dead weight right now?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.915
Man, those guys are
askin' for it.

13:54.042 --> 13:57.753
The hell with them.
They just don't like being
low men on the totem pole.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.342
I mean, you gotta give
'em some props though.

14:03.426 --> 14:08.263
Squad? They train hard,
every now and then,
they do a badass rescue.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.729
I just wish they
weren't so cocky about it.

14:15.897 --> 14:16.939
Ha.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.652
Hey.
What's up, Captain?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.822
I think I got an
idea to get people excited
about this Chilleez thing.

14:26.824 --> 14:27.866
Yeah?

14:27.951 --> 14:30.077
I'm thinking crowd funding.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.329
You mean like getting other
people to chip in money?

14:32.413 --> 14:35.165
Yeah. Diversity in start-up
money's always a good thing.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.458
Uh...

14:36.584 --> 14:40.796
All right, look, all you
gotta do is bring together a
bunch of potential investors,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.549
you ask 'em for
small donations, then you
just gotta figure out

14:43.633 --> 14:46.385
some simple rewards system
for incentive.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.303
They get the payback when this

14:48.388 --> 14:51.139
thing goes big.
Which it will.

14:52.308 --> 14:56.770
Okay, so like I'll send
out mailers and do like a
friends-and-family thing?

14:57.146 --> 15:01.108
Well, how about you put
out an appeal to your
pals here at 51?

15:01.359 --> 15:03.193
You could have a
fundraiser at Molly's.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.570
What, really?

15:04.654 --> 15:06.572
Yeah, sure! I can
help you put it together.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.491
Okay. You've really got
a gift for this stuff.

15:09.617 --> 15:14.246
I know! I know. Hey.
You all better show up.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.256
Hey, Chief.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.757
Is everything okay?

15:25.842 --> 15:27.843
Uh, it will be, I'm sure.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.512
But everything is not
okay now?

15:31.306 --> 15:33.557
They're big boys,
they'll figure it out.

15:34.726 --> 15:35.809
Who?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.313
I was asking about your
new partner.

15:40.857 --> 15:44.693
Of course. Yeah, she's great.
It's a really good fit.
Thanks for asking.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.320
What were you talking about?

15:47.697 --> 15:48.822
Nothing.

15:51.743 --> 15:56.288
- Ambulance 61. Person down.
- 9633 North Cleveland Avenue.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.598
Baptism, funeral or...

16:14.682 --> 16:16.016
Wedding.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.727
Over here!
We were in the middle
of the wedding when all

16:18.811 --> 16:20.854
of a sudden she dropped
like a lead balloon.
This way.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.066
Hurry up!

16:24.150 --> 16:25.484
We can't tell if
she's breathing.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.574
Is she dead?

16:33.743 --> 16:36.244
You gotta get her up.
We didn't even finish
the vows!

16:37.246 --> 16:40.582
Groomzilla, there's
a very sick woman here.
Can you calm the hell down?

16:41.751 --> 16:44.336
Can anyone describe
the pastor's condition
before she lost consciousness?

16:44.754 --> 16:47.756
She looked a little confused.
Like, forgetting
what she was gonna say.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.549
Dad, you were talking
with her just before.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.551
She said she had
a headache, so I gave her
a couple aspirin.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.429
Can I see what you
gave her, sir?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.098
'Course, yeah.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.520
Do you have high blood
pressure, sir?

17:01.604 --> 17:03.313
Yeah, I do.
How'd you know that?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.107
I think he gave her
blood pressure medication.

17:05.608 --> 17:06.566
Oh my god.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.528
Hypovolemic shock, it's
consistent with the symptoms.
I'm gonna get a line going.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.779
Okay.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.539
All right, bolus is ready.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.833
Got it. Run it wide open.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.514
Oh. Oh. I'm so sorry.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.892
Thank God!

17:43.980 --> 17:46.398
All right. I'm sorry guys,
the wedding's still on hold.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.818
We need to get the pastor to
the hospital to get checked
out. It won't take long.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.361
Whatever you
think is best.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.487
Oh.

17:52.655 --> 17:53.697
Ah.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.532
Easy.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.166
"Groomzilla." Good one.

18:04.542 --> 18:08.670
Thanks. Hey, you did that
bride a favor. Now she
has a few days to reconsider.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.006
Amen.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.265
You gonna run a load
or you just here to
keep an eye on me?

18:22.143 --> 18:25.103
Look, we both know
what's going on.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.441
What I know is I'm
new guy so I'm just
hanging back,

18:29.525 --> 18:31.568
letting my lieutenant
deal with this.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.571
Once that's run its course,
if we still got a problem,

18:34.655 --> 18:36.656
you and me are
gonna take a walk,
we're gonna figure this out.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.171
Connie said you wanted to
see me, Chief?

18:51.255 --> 18:52.547
Yeah, come on in.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.134
Close the door.

19:01.849 --> 19:05.101
Okay. What is going on
in my firehouse?

19:07.480 --> 19:09.397
Is there some kind of
problem with Scott Rice?

19:10.149 --> 19:13.652
The only person who's got
a problem with Scott Rice
is Otis,

19:13.736 --> 19:15.111
and it's a total load.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.488
Specifically?

19:16.572 --> 19:17.739
It's not worth repeating.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.033
I agree. And I've already
talked to Otis about it.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.078
Yeah, well now you're
talking to me.
What is the accusation?

19:25.331 --> 19:27.666
There's a bogus claim that
Rice ducked on a call.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.043
If it's bogus, why hasn't
it been put to rest?

19:30.586 --> 19:31.962
That's what I wanna know.

19:37.718 --> 19:42.681
Okay, the two of you.
Get this situation under
control. Understood?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.184
On it, Chief.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.320
You gonna talk to your guys?

19:57.446 --> 20:01.366
I will, yeah. But right
now I gotta go deal
with Jack Nesbitt.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.788
Your... Your side business
is more important than this?

20:08.624 --> 20:11.501
Actually, yeah, it is.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.970
Sergeant, old friend of yours
is here.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.264
Thanks for coming.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.142
You win. What do you
need from me?

20:27.685 --> 20:29.019
How long you work for
Nesbitt?

20:29.103 --> 20:30.979
Little over a month,
I guess.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.522
Doing what?

20:32.607 --> 20:34.107
Expanding his club.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.192
You see anything shady in
your time over there?

20:36.861 --> 20:37.861
It's a strip club.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.574
These guys traffic eastern
European women
against their will across

20:42.658 --> 20:45.493
the Canadian border,
through an Indian reservation.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.747
They force them into work.
It's a kind of
indentured servitude.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.582
Like dancing at Stilettos?

20:50.666 --> 20:51.708
Yeah, if they're lucky.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.670
Point is, Nesbitt's almost
certainly involved in some
capacity. I mean maybe

20:55.755 --> 20:57.714
he's only laundering the
gang's money through his club,

20:57.798 --> 20:59.466
but he could be in
much deeper.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.968
Now Casey,
these women are being held
against their will.

21:02.053 --> 21:05.764
Now most of them have a sister
or a mother back home who's
under threat from the gang.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.766
I get the general concept.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.684
Just tell me how
I can help.

21:09.852 --> 21:13.021
All right first step, go
to Nesbitt and get your
job back.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.857
We'll figure
it out from there.

21:33.250 --> 21:37.128
Olde Rumpelstiltskin twenty.
Only the best, huh?

21:37.380 --> 21:38.713
Always.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.382
Two scotches, on the rocks.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.591
Thanks.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.218
Are you buying me a
drink in my own place?

21:43.761 --> 21:48.556
Listen, Jack if we don't
get in each other's
faces I think we'll work

21:48.724 --> 21:50.058
together just fine.

21:50.893 --> 21:55.689
Sounds more than fair.
You passed the integrity test,
Matt.

21:55.773 --> 21:59.192
An honest man is
hard to come by in this town.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.570
Can't argue with that.

22:02.655 --> 22:07.492
Welcome back. Friday night,
I'm hosting an event.
The investors want you there.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.576
Can you make it?

22:08.953 --> 22:09.995
Friday?

22:10.079 --> 22:11.579
Yeah. Sure.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.914
Katya!

22:14.250 --> 22:15.333
Show Matt a good time,
will you?

22:15.418 --> 22:16.751
Of course.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.964
I knew you'd be back.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.174
Really? I wasn't so sure.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.469
What's this "event"
on Friday?

22:26.637 --> 22:29.055
Oh it's just a little
thing we do from time
to time,

22:29.181 --> 22:30.724
to show off the new girls.

22:32.059 --> 22:35.186
I'm glad you're back, Matt.
You and me,

22:35.271 --> 22:38.940
we can look out for each
other. That sound okay?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.027
Yeah.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.494
Okay. So the SEC has
a lot of really boring rules

22:51.579 --> 22:55.665
about what constitutes as
an investment for, um,
a private business.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.377
So, technically, I can't
really solicit investments
and you guys wouldn't

22:59.462 --> 23:04.340
be considered investors,
you'd be backers.
And the good news is,

23:04.467 --> 23:05.925
is that backers get rewards!

23:07.470 --> 23:09.596
Yeah do you wanna hear what
the rewards are?

23:09.764 --> 23:10.889
Yeah.

23:10.973 --> 23:17.395
Okay! So, for ten dollars
or more, you'll receive
a six-pack of the inaugural

23:17.480 --> 23:19.397
run of Chilleez champagne.

23:19.482 --> 23:20.774
Wait. How many?

23:20.858 --> 23:23.902
Hey guys actually,
you know what? Could you
maybe tighten up the ranks

23:23.986 --> 23:25.487
a little bit, so I don't
have to yell at you?

23:25.571 --> 23:28.281
Yeah, come on up, don't
be shy. We've got
plenty of room up here.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.116
Come on! Slide up.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.662
Oh, uh, sorry you know
this is a Truck table.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.040
No Squad allowed.
I'm sure you guys understand.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.542
When did you get so mouthy?

23:39.627 --> 23:41.795
You know what, I think
it was right around the
time I was accused of

23:41.879 --> 23:44.839
being a whiny gossip,
when the fact of the
matter is, I'm right.

23:45.925 --> 23:46.925
Rice is a ducker.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.093
Whoa!

23:48.385 --> 23:50.220
Hey! Guys! Guys.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.806
Why don't you stand up, huh?

23:53.349 --> 23:55.809
See man I told you once,
you need to shut your mouth.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.227
You don't get
a second warning.

23:57.311 --> 24:00.605
You keep sticking your head
in the sand.
Rice was ducking and no one

24:00.689 --> 24:02.273
on Squad gives a crap!

24:02.358 --> 24:03.858
Hey, hey, hey!

24:04.693 --> 24:05.693
Knock it off.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.325
You know what?
There's plenty other places
in this town to grab a drink.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.120
Yeah, there are.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.217
You better watch yourself,
Otis.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.010
Hey, enough with the sideshow.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.305
All right, let's go, come on.
Back to the main event.
All right

24:34.390 --> 24:37.142
so listen, Chili,
you were saying about
the rewards and...

24:37.518 --> 24:38.768
It's okay,
let's just forget it.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.229
Nah come on, are you sure?

24:42.731 --> 24:45.358
It's fine, I'll just do
it at the firehouse
again sometime.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.914
Really?

25:05.629 --> 25:08.673
I'll be here early
so stop by the district
on your way to work,

25:08.757 --> 25:10.425
we can go
over the details.

25:10.718 --> 25:14.179
Are you out of your mind?
Did you really take
a swing at Otis?

25:16.932 --> 25:22.187
I tried to. I might
try again. You need to
get your guys in line.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.189
Maybe my guys aren't
the problem.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.607
The hell they're not.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.735
Before your buddy Rice got
here, Otis and Cruz

25:28.819 --> 25:31.029
were just as much family
to you as Capp and Tony.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.697
I know Rice.
He's not a ducker.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.657
You better be damn sure.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.076
Yeah and you better keep
Truck on their side of
the fence.

25:37.161 --> 25:40.788
Oh, that's always
a great move, drawing lines
between Truck and Squad.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.666
Like when you decided that
Squad doesn't vent right

25:43.751 --> 25:44.834
before Darden went
up in flames.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.005
Did you really just say that?

25:49.089 --> 25:52.008
I'm just trying to make
the point that...
No, I got the point.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.093
Loud and clear.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.315
Yeah, all I'm saying is,
you've made your point.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.234
But now, it is time
to drop it.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.361
What, and pretend I didn't
see what I saw?

26:11.445 --> 26:14.697
No, of course not.
But, the bottom line is,
we all gotta live together.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.824
What if it happens again?

26:17.034 --> 26:19.702
Severide needs to take
a hard look at Rice,
instead of coming at me

26:19.787 --> 26:20.954
with this fist cocked.

26:21.038 --> 26:24.249
Severide's just doing his job
as Rice's Lieutenant,
standing up for his guy.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.669
Yeah. Well, who's gonna
stand up for me?

26:28.003 --> 26:32.257
Hey, I am. I got
your back a hundred percent.
We all have your back.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.925
That's not in question, but...

26:35.344 --> 26:36.761
Hey, Connie, what's up?

26:36.845 --> 26:38.805
Chief Boden is looking
for Otis.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.899
You looking for me, Chief?

26:49.984 --> 26:51.651
Yeah, come on in. Close
the door and have a seat.

26:59.785 --> 27:00.785
What's up?

27:01.537 --> 27:03.371
I hear you still have
a problem with Scott Rice.

27:04.373 --> 27:08.751
I think he's a danger
to this firehouse, yeah.
Chief,

27:08.836 --> 27:12.880
twice I saw him
back out of a call
when things got hairy.

27:13.716 --> 27:17.719
So-called "equipment issues"
both times.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.637
Do you have proof they
weren't real issues?

27:19.722 --> 27:23.725
No. It is a gut feeling.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.561
Okay.

27:29.648 --> 27:33.067
Is there anything else going
on with you that I need to
be made aware of, Brian?

27:35.362 --> 27:39.115
You fed up being stuck
on elevator duty for
the last seven years?

27:39.199 --> 27:42.076
Tired of the grind
of shift work?

27:43.412 --> 27:45.330
Do you need to
take a furlough?

27:48.375 --> 27:51.627
No, sir. I'm very
happy here at 51.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.758
Then I suggest you stop
shooting off your mouth.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.635
Lieutenant Severide
is responsible

27:59.720 --> 28:02.638
for supervising the men under
his command and I intend
to let him do so.

28:02.723 --> 28:06.267
Now can you handle that
or not?

28:12.608 --> 28:14.025
I can, sir.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.863
Get back to work.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.584
Hey.

28:31.668 --> 28:32.919
Oh, hey.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.421
How you doing?

28:35.506 --> 28:36.798
Great.

28:36.882 --> 28:37.965
Yeah?

28:38.175 --> 28:42.804
Yeah. I'm ready for another
one, just Truck and
friends only this time.

28:43.013 --> 28:46.682
Maybe, we hold off on
it a little while.

28:47.643 --> 28:48.684
Hold off?

28:48.769 --> 28:52.397
I know that you think
I'm an overnight success,
but the truth is,

28:52.481 --> 28:56.651
I took a lot of real big
hits before I got Molly's
up and running.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.737
I lost my shirt more
than a of couple times.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.281
Are you abandoning ship,
Captain?

29:02.366 --> 29:04.325
I don't want to see
you hurt, that's all.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.373
Okay. All right.
I totally get it.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.253
But just so you know,
I'm all in on this thing,
whether you're helping or not.

29:15.337 --> 29:18.047
I admire your stick-to-
itiveness, but...

29:18.132 --> 29:19.132
I'm not giving
up, Herrmann.

29:23.011 --> 29:28.433
Hey thanks for all your help.
Nobody's supported me
like that since my dad died.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.771
This whole Chilleez
thing was his idea.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.482
You know the funny thing is,
is you actually...

29:36.567 --> 29:38.151
You remind me of him.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.698
It meant a lot,
you looking out.

29:51.540 --> 29:56.377
Hey, um, Rice. I've been
meaning to ask, are you
still using that loaner or

29:56.462 --> 29:58.546
did you get your mask
back from the shop?

29:59.089 --> 30:03.092
Uh, no. Got mine. Jerry
at Air-Mask said it was
just a faulty gauge,

30:03.177 --> 30:04.427
fixed it up good as new.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.553
Glad to hear it.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.350
Truck 81,
Squad Three, Ambo 61,
car fire.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.792
Hey! This guy needs
some help!

30:36.919 --> 30:38.336
Anybody else in that vehicle?

30:38.420 --> 30:39.462
It's just him!

30:39.546 --> 30:41.506
Okay, Truck, help 51 get
a line on that fire.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.550
You two, help with the
victim. Get the line from
Engine, bring her up.

30:45.093 --> 30:48.596
Squad, stabilize that vehicle.
Turn that ambo
around and back her up here.

30:48.805 --> 30:49.847
Yeah, copy.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.350
Now give the medics
room to work, please.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.269
Come on, back up people,
let's go. Back it up.
Back it up.

30:57.231 --> 31:00.149
Miss, you need to hop
out. Everybody stand on
the side. Because I said so!

31:00.442 --> 31:01.943
Back up, guys! Back up.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.113
Capp, get the chalk.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.406
Got it.

31:11.745 --> 31:13.538
One, two, three.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.295
Get a line
on that truck!

31:23.090 --> 31:24.298
It's moving!

31:27.803 --> 31:28.803
Chief!

31:29.513 --> 31:30.888
Look out! Truck's rolling!

31:30.973 --> 31:32.056
Oh god.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.724
Everybody move now!

31:37.521 --> 31:38.813
Come on.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.734
Severide!

31:58.417 --> 31:59.417
Damn.

32:01.837 --> 32:02.837
Hell.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.342
Okay, let's get some
water on it.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.431
I thought we were almost
roadkill.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.850
Yeah. Thanks for letting us
keep our guts on the inside.

32:22.149 --> 32:23.941
Here comes the water!

32:50.469 --> 32:51.636
Hey, what you making?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.846
Cheese toast. My specialty.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.098
Little light on the cheese.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.433
My kids say the same
damn thing.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.646
Hey so,
I just hope you know,
I ain't mad at ya.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.192
I'm glad to hear it.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.487
'Cause I've been thinking
about it again.

33:09.738 --> 33:10.905
Uh-oh.

33:13.659 --> 33:17.328
If you're gonna keep going,
so am I.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.414
You steer, and I'll be
your category five
at your back.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.458
But you gotta promise me
one thing.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.086
What?

33:26.338 --> 33:30.091
No more using your own
money on Chilleez, all
right? I spoke with Cindy

33:30.384 --> 33:34.053
about this, and we're
gonna give you a personal,
no-interest loan from

33:34.137 --> 33:36.931
the Molly's fund. That's how
much I believe in this thing.

33:39.893 --> 33:45.022
Wow. Um, I can't accept that.

33:45.899 --> 33:46.899
Hey.

33:47.776 --> 33:51.445
You can and you will.
And here's what you can
give me in return.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.447
Nothin' more than a
chance to get in on

33:53.532 --> 33:55.700
the ground floor when this
thing's up and running.

33:57.953 --> 34:01.038
Herrmann! You're the man.

34:02.708 --> 34:03.791
You're a good kid.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.878
Thank you.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.141
Hey. How's, uh, everything
going with the case?

34:21.143 --> 34:22.768
So far, so good.

34:26.815 --> 34:31.819
Man, this sucks. Just knowing
that you're maybe in a,

34:33.488 --> 34:36.282
in a bad situation, and I had
something to do with putting
you there.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.785
Gabby, don't worry.
I'm glad you came to me.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.079
It's gonna be fine.

34:42.164 --> 34:45.833
Well Antonio knows that I will
kill him if he lets anything
bad happen to you, so.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.170
Oh yeah?

34:49.379 --> 34:52.965
Yeah. I can't help it.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.182
Just swear to me you'll
be careful?

35:02.392 --> 35:04.018
Cross my heart.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.199
Hey Rice!
Hey, hold up a sec.

35:18.825 --> 35:19.909
Hey, what's up?

35:19.993 --> 35:21.994
I just want to make
sure this doesn't unsaid...

35:23.121 --> 35:27.249
If you ever need to talk to me
about anything, anything at
all, you know you can, right?

35:27.334 --> 35:29.585
Sure, yeah, I know.
Like what?

35:30.295 --> 35:31.545
Anything.

35:32.923 --> 35:34.840
What's going on, Kelly?

35:35.842 --> 35:39.053
It's my duty as your
officer to check in,
make sure you're all right.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.680
You got a question,
spit it out.

35:42.641 --> 35:48.479
Okay. I need you to
look me in the eye
and tell me that your

35:48.563 --> 35:51.023
mask malfunctioned
on that call.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.484
That you weren't just
bailing when things got tough.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.826
I swear to you,
man to man, that my mask
was not working.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.748
Okay. Good. I had to ask.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.418
Sure, yeah, no I get it.
You're in a tough spot,

36:11.503 --> 36:14.672
trying to be my friend
as well as my lieutenant.

36:14.756 --> 36:16.382
Let me make it easy on you.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.427
From now on,
just worry about
being my lieutenant.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.887
Scott.

36:26.768 --> 36:28.561
So it looks like a
regular cell phone, right?

36:29.104 --> 36:32.773
Except inside, behind the
battery, listening device.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.442
When you press the volume
button all

36:35.527 --> 36:37.403
the way up, that's recording
high quality audio.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.239
It's got a built-in
microphone, totally
self-contained, no wires.

36:40.323 --> 36:44.743
So, I won't be asking you to
shave your chest. You can
go ahead, if you want,

36:45.203 --> 36:46.620
just don't do it on
my account.

36:46.705 --> 36:47.830
How do I turn on
the screen?

36:47.914 --> 36:49.874
Same as a regular phone.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.670
Look, if you don't like it,
you can go with the key fob.

36:54.754 --> 36:58.757
You tap that button twice,
it starts recording.
Pretty, uh, unobtrusive.

37:01.094 --> 37:04.555
Shouldn't it have a logo
on it? Ford or something?
This looks pretty fake.

37:05.015 --> 37:07.057
You're over-thinking this,
Casey.

37:07.142 --> 37:09.476
That's easy for you to say.
It's not your ass on the line.

37:12.522 --> 37:14.982
I'll take the phone,
just tell me what you
need me to do.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.903
All right. We think Nesbitt's
bringing in a new

37:18.987 --> 37:22.448
shipment of women and he's
gonna trot 'em out
at this party.

37:22.532 --> 37:25.576
We want you to engage Nesbitt
and his friends. Try to get
him talking specifics

37:25.702 --> 37:31.081
about the operation.
Names of anyone involved,
how the girls are smuggled in,

37:31.166 --> 37:32.541
how the money's
laundered.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.919
And how am I supposed
to get these scumbags
to talk to a contractor

37:35.003 --> 37:36.629
they barely know?

37:37.505 --> 37:39.965
Well, you're close with a
girl over there, right?
You could use her.

37:42.844 --> 37:46.597
One thing I don't get.
There are hundreds of
contractors in Chicago.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.141
Why is Nesbitt so
interested in me?

37:49.684 --> 37:53.687
You probably make him feel
comfortable. You're a fellow
firefighter, trustworthy.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.649
Look maybe he's using you
as a front.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.567
Yeah. Or a patsy.

37:58.652 --> 38:02.571
Anything's possible. Look you
don't have to worry. We got
your back.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.408
You better.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.332
Matt Casey.

39:13.393 --> 39:15.269
Jack. How are you?

39:15.603 --> 39:17.229
Good, Matt. You?

39:18.273 --> 39:25.112
Yeah. Guys.
So, uh, what's going on?

39:25.447 --> 39:31.368
Come on over, have a seat.
Come on. Please.
First thing's first.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.749
What's this?

39:36.875 --> 39:39.084
I'm sorry, Matt. I guess
it's, uh, standard procedure.

39:43.673 --> 39:44.882
Please.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.801
Wait, let me see your phone.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.349
What for?

39:54.684 --> 39:56.185
Let me see it.
