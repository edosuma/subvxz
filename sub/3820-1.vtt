# Looking out a dirty, old window?

00:16.315 --> 00:21.310
? Outside the cars in the city
go rushing by?

00:21.388 --> 00:27.360
? I sit here alone, and I wonder why?

00:27.493 --> 00:30.394
? Friday night and everyone's moving?

00:30.463 --> 00:31.953
? I can feel the heat?

00:32.031 --> 00:33.658
? But it's soothing?

00:33.733 --> 00:36.031
? Heading down?

00:36.102 --> 00:39.697
? I search for the beat
in this dirty town?

00:39.772 --> 00:42.366
? Downtown, the young ones are going?

00:42.441 --> 00:45.410
? Downtown, the young ones are growing?

00:45.478 --> 00:48.572
? We're the kids in America?

00:48.647 --> 00:51.844
? We're the kids in America??

00:51.917 --> 00:53.646
Então, O.K., você provavelmente vai,

00:53.719 --> 00:56.483
Is this, like,
a Noxema commercial or what?

00:56.555 --> 00:57.920
Mas sério,

00:57.990 --> 01:00.925
Na verdade eu tenho uma vida normal
para uma adolescente.

01:00.993 --> 01:03.257
Quero dizer, eu levanto, escovo meus dentes.

01:03.329 --> 01:06.059
Eu pego minha roupa da escola.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.162
? They do it over there?

01:10.236 --> 01:11.726
? But we don't do it here?

01:11.804 --> 01:14.796
? Ooh, bop?

01:14.874 --> 01:16.933
? Fashion?

01:17.009 --> 01:17.941
? Fashion?

01:18.010 --> 01:18.942
? Turn to the left?

01:19.011 --> 01:19.943
? Fashion?

01:20.012 --> 01:21.639
? Turn to the right?

01:21.714 --> 01:24.012
? Ooh, fashion??

01:24.083 --> 01:25.948
Daddy's a litigator.

01:26.018 --> 01:28.452
Those are the scariest kinds of lawyers.

01:28.521 --> 01:31.456
Even Lucy, our maid,
is terrified of him.

01:31.524 --> 01:33.458
And Daddy is so good,

01:33.526 --> 01:35.153
he gets $500 an hour
to fight with people.

01:35.227 --> 01:36.956
He fights with me for free.

01:37.029 --> 01:38.462
Daddy!

01:38.531 --> 01:40.465
Cher, please don't start
with the juice again.

01:40.533 --> 01:41.966
Daddy, you need your Vitamin C.

01:42.034 --> 01:43.467
Where's my briefcase?

01:43.536 --> 01:46.471
It's been a couple months now.
Let's go to Malibu.

01:46.539 --> 01:47.972
Don't tell me those lowlifes

01:48.040 --> 01:49.473
have been calling again.

01:49.542 --> 01:50.975
They are your parents.

01:51.043 --> 01:52.977
Don't sneak out of the office.

01:53.045 --> 01:54.979
Dr. Lovett's giving you a flu shot.

01:55.047 --> 01:56.480
Josh is coming for dinner.

01:56.549 --> 01:57.538
Why?

01:57.616 --> 01:58.878
He's your stepbrother!

01:58.951 --> 02:01.419
You were hardly married to his mother.

02:01.487 --> 02:03.546
Why do I have to see Josh?

02:03.622 --> 02:05.920
You divorce wives, not children.

02:05.991 --> 02:07.219
Here.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.624
Forget it!

02:08.693 --> 02:11.424
Did I show you
the loqued out Jeep Daddy got me?

02:11.497 --> 02:13.931
It's got four-wheel drive,
dual side airbags,

02:13.999 --> 02:15.432
and a monster sound system.

02:15.501 --> 02:16.934
I don't have a license yet,

02:17.002 --> 02:19.232
but I need something to learn on.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.205
Boy! That came out of nowhere!

02:24.276 --> 02:25.937
Here's where Dionne lives.

02:26.011 --> 02:27.444
She's my friend

02:27.513 --> 02:29.947
because we both know what it's like

02:30.015 --> 02:32.245
to have people jealous of us.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.445
- Girlfriend!
- I must give her snaps

02:34.520 --> 02:36.454
for her courageous fashion efforts.

02:36.522 --> 02:38.456
Hey, Cher.

02:38.524 --> 02:41.960
Dionne and I were both named
after great singers of the past

02:42.027 --> 02:44.154
who now do infomercials.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.993
So?

02:46.065 --> 02:47.157
Been shopping with Dr. Seuss?

02:47.233 --> 02:49.633
I wouldn't skin a collie for a backpack.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.499
It's faux.

02:51.570 --> 02:53.538
Hello! That was a stop sign.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.096
I totally paused.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.608
Yeah. O.K.

03:00.412 --> 03:03.279
It's not even 8:30,
and Murray is paging me.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.907
He is so possessive.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.918
This weekend he called me,

03:06.986 --> 03:08.419
and he's all, Where were you today?

03:08.487 --> 03:10.114
Dionne and her boyfriend Murray

03:10.189 --> 03:12.419
are in this dramatic relationship.

03:12.491 --> 03:14.686
I think they've seen
that lke and Tina Turner movie

03:14.760 --> 03:15.920
just too many times.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.395
Now, I have to say to her...

03:18.464 --> 03:21.524
Why do you put up with it?
You could do better.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.862
I know. Shh. Here he comes.

03:26.038 --> 03:28.165
Woman, why don't you
be answering any of my pages?

03:28.240 --> 03:29.332
I hate when you call me woman.

03:29.408 --> 03:30.932
Where you been all weekend?

03:31.010 --> 03:32.534
You jeepin' behind my back?

03:32.611 --> 03:33.942
Jeepin'.

03:34.013 --> 03:36.447
No! But speaking of vehicular sex,

03:36.515 --> 03:39.450
perhaps you can explain
how this Kmart hair extension

03:39.518 --> 03:41.452
got into the backseat of your car.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.318
I don't know where that came from.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.950
That looks like one of
your stringy something or anothers.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.960
I do not wear polyester hair, O.K.?

03:49.028 --> 03:51.121
Unlike Shawanna.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.220
Dee, I'm Audi.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.458
Bye.

03:53.532 --> 03:55.363
That's it. I've had it with you.

03:55.434 --> 03:57.664
Is it that time of the month again?

03:57.736 --> 03:59.169
I don't know why

03:59.238 --> 04:01.900
Dionne's going out
with a high school boy.

04:01.974 --> 04:03.407
They're like dogs.

04:03.475 --> 04:05.409
You have to clean them and feed them.

04:05.477 --> 04:06.910
They're just like
these nervous creatures

04:06.979 --> 04:08.913
that jump and slobber all over you.

04:08.981 --> 04:10.915
Ew! Get off of me!

04:10.983 --> 04:11.915
[Crash]

04:11.984 --> 04:13.781
Oh, as if!

04:13.852 --> 04:18.414
Should all oppressed people
be allowed refuge in America?

04:18.490 --> 04:20.923
Amber will take the con position.

04:20.993 --> 04:22.927
Cher will be pro.

04:22.995 --> 04:24.929
Cher, two minutes.

04:24.997 --> 04:27.431
So. O.K.

04:27.499 --> 04:29.433
Like, right now, for example,

04:29.501 --> 04:32.436
the Haiti-ans need to come to America.

04:32.504 --> 04:33.937
Some people are all,

04:34.006 --> 04:35.940
What about
the strain on our resources?

04:36.008 --> 04:37.942
Like, when I had this garden party

04:38.010 --> 04:39.602
for my father's birthday, right?

04:39.678 --> 04:42.704
I said RSVP because
it was a sit-down dinner.

04:42.781 --> 04:45.443
But people came that,
like, did not RSVP,

04:45.517 --> 04:47.815
so I was, like, totally buggin'.

04:47.886 --> 04:50.446
I had to haul ass to the kitchen,

04:50.522 --> 04:53.047
redistribute the food,
squish in extra place settings.

04:53.125 --> 04:54.956
By the end of the day,

04:55.027 --> 04:56.892
it was, like, the more the merrier.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.897
So if the government
could just get to the kitchen,

04:59.965 --> 05:01.398
rearrange some things,

05:01.467 --> 05:04.402
we could certainly
party with the Haiti-ans.

05:04.470 --> 05:08.406
May I remind you
that it does not say RSVP

05:08.474 --> 05:10.374
on the Statue of Liberty?

05:10.442 --> 05:12.342
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

05:12.411 --> 05:13.901
Thank you very much.

05:13.979 --> 05:16.072
[Applause]

05:20.486 --> 05:22.044
Amber, reply?

05:22.121 --> 05:24.419
Mr. Hall, how can I answer that?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.923
The topic is Haiti,

05:25.991 --> 05:28.186
and she's talking about
some little party.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.627
Hello! It was his 50th birthday.

05:31.697 --> 05:32.925
Whatever.

05:32.998 --> 05:36.490
If she doesn't do the assignment,
I can't do mine.

05:36.568 --> 05:38.433
Ladies.

05:38.504 --> 05:42.440
So, does anyone have
any further thoughts on Cher's oration?

05:42.508 --> 05:43.941
Elton, comments?

05:44.009 --> 05:45.943
Yeah, I can't find
my Cranberries CD.

05:46.011 --> 05:47.945
I got to go to the quad
before somebody snags it.

05:48.013 --> 05:49.947
I'm afraid I can't permit that.

05:50.015 --> 05:51.346
Any further insights?

05:51.417 --> 05:52.975
I have an insight, Mr. Hall.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.349
I'm all ears.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.389
O.K., like, the way I feel
about the Rolling Stones

05:57.456 --> 06:01.392
is the way my kids are going
to feel about Nine Inch Nails,

06:01.460 --> 06:04.122
so I really shouldn't torment
my mom anymore, huh?

06:04.196 --> 06:08.189
Yes, well, it's a little
off the subject of Haiti,

06:08.267 --> 06:11.134
but tolerance is always a good lesson.

06:11.203 --> 06:14.900
Even when it comes out of nowhere.

06:14.973 --> 06:16.907
And with that in mind,

06:16.975 --> 06:19.409
I'm going to distribute
your report cards.

06:19.478 --> 06:22.413
Now, is there
a Christian Stovitz in this class?

06:22.481 --> 06:23.914
Mr. Hall, the buzz on Christian

06:23.982 --> 06:25.916
is that his parents have joint custody.

06:25.984 --> 06:27.918
He'll be spending
one semester in Chicago

06:27.986 --> 06:29.419
and one semester here.

06:29.488 --> 06:33.117
I think it is a travesty
of the legal profession.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.160
Thank you for that perspective, Cher.

06:38.497 --> 06:40.431
[Whimpering]

06:40.499 --> 06:45.095
Could all conversations
please come to a halt?

06:48.307 --> 06:50.434
And could the suicide attempts

06:50.509 --> 06:52.943
please be postponed
till the next period?

06:55.514 --> 06:58.381
Suddenly, a dark cloud
settled over first period.

06:58.450 --> 07:01.180
I got a C in Debate?

07:01.253 --> 07:02.379
[Bell Ringing]

07:02.454 --> 07:03.887
Dee?

07:03.956 --> 07:05.890
Did you get your report card?

07:05.958 --> 07:07.892
Yeah. I'm toast. How did you do?

07:07.960 --> 07:08.927
I totally choked.

07:08.994 --> 07:10.894
My father's going to
go ballistic on me.

07:10.963 --> 07:12.897
Mr. Hall was way harsh.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.399
He gave me a C-minus.

07:15.467 --> 07:18.903
He gave me a C,
which drags down my entire average.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.404
Bye.

07:20.472 --> 07:21.907
I'll call you.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.405
Isn't my house classic?

07:23.475 --> 07:27.275
The columns date
all the way back to 1972.

07:27.345 --> 07:29.404
Wasn't my mom a Betty?

07:29.481 --> 07:32.416
She died when I was just a baby.

07:32.484 --> 07:34.918
A fluke accident
during a routine liposuction.

07:34.986 --> 07:36.419
I don't remember her,

07:36.488 --> 07:38.513
but I like to pretend
she still watches over me.

07:38.590 --> 07:42.651
Hey, Mom. 98 in Geometry.
Pretty groovy, huh?

07:42.727 --> 07:44.422
[Soft Music Playing]

07:44.496 --> 07:49.934
Yuck! The maudlin music
of the university station?

07:50.001 --> 07:51.400
Wah wah wah!

07:53.505 --> 07:56.872
Yuck! What is it about
college and crybaby music?

07:56.942 --> 07:58.375
Hey.

07:58.443 --> 08:00.377
Who's watching the Galleria?

08:00.445 --> 08:02.379
The flannel shirt...
Is that a nod

08:02.447 --> 08:04.381
to the crispy Seattle weather?

08:04.449 --> 08:07.384
Or are you trying to stay warm
in front of the refrigerator?

08:07.452 --> 08:09.886
Oh, wow, you're filling out there.

08:09.955 --> 08:12.890
Oh, wow, your face is
catching up with your mouth.

08:12.958 --> 08:14.892
I went by Dad's office.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.394
He is not your dad.
Go torture a new family.

08:17.462 --> 08:19.396
Just because my mother
marries someone else

08:19.464 --> 08:20.897
doesn't mean he's my father.

08:20.966 --> 08:22.593
That's exactly what it means.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.897
I hope you're not
thinking of staying here.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.403
I sure want to.

08:26.471 --> 08:28.405
I got a place near school.

08:28.473 --> 08:30.805
Shouldn't you go to school
on the East Coast?

08:30.875 --> 08:33.900
I hear girls at NYU
aren't at all particular.

08:33.979 --> 08:35.913
You're funny.

08:37.982 --> 08:39.883
Hey!

08:39.951 --> 08:42.919
You just got here, and already
you're playing couch commando.

08:42.988 --> 08:45.422
In some parts of the universe,

08:45.490 --> 08:49.688
it's considered cool to know
what's going on in the world.

08:49.761 --> 08:53.424
I so need lessons
from you on how to be cool.

08:53.498 --> 08:55.796
Tell me that part
about Kenny G. Again.

08:55.867 --> 09:00.133
Come on, you chuckleheads!
Get in here!

09:01.439 --> 09:03.373
Josh, are you still growing?

09:03.441 --> 09:05.375
You look taller than you did at Easter.

09:05.443 --> 09:06.876
I don't think so.

09:06.945 --> 09:09.379
His head looks bigger.

09:09.447 --> 09:11.881
So, Josh, have you given any thought

09:11.950 --> 09:13.884
to our discussion about corporate law?

09:13.952 --> 09:16.386
I think I'd like
to check out environmental law.

09:16.454 --> 09:19.582
What for? You want to have
a miserable, frustrating life?

09:19.657 --> 09:22.182
Josh will have that
no matter what he does.

09:22.260 --> 09:24.160
He knows what he wants to do.

09:24.229 --> 09:25.821
He's in a good college.

09:25.897 --> 09:27.888
I'd like to see you
have some direction.

09:27.966 --> 09:30.025
I have direction.

09:30.101 --> 09:31.227
Yeah. Towards the mall.

09:31.302 --> 09:32.894
Where's your report card?

09:32.971 --> 09:34.529
It's not ready yet.

09:34.606 --> 09:36.130
What do you mean
it's not ready yet?

09:36.207 --> 09:38.903
Some teachers were trying
to lowball me, Daddy.

09:38.977 --> 09:41.411
You say never accept a first offer.

09:41.479 --> 09:43.743
These grades are a jumping-off point

09:43.815 --> 09:45.146
to start negotiations.

09:45.216 --> 09:46.410
Very good.

09:46.484 --> 09:47.917
[Telephone Rings]

09:47.986 --> 09:49.920
- Dee?
- Hello?
- Yeah?

09:49.988 --> 09:51.421
Yeah, Jake. What?

09:51.489 --> 09:53.423
No! Not the afternoon!

09:53.491 --> 09:55.186
You are such a brownnoser.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.421
You are such
a superficial space cadet.

09:57.495 --> 09:59.929
What makes you think your teachers
will change your grades?

09:59.998 --> 10:03.434
Only the fact that I've done it
every other semester.

10:05.403 --> 10:07.428
I told my P.E. teacher

10:07.505 --> 10:09.939
an evil male had broken my heart.

10:10.008 --> 10:12.442
So she raised my C to a B.

10:12.510 --> 10:14.444
They're horrible! Don't feel bad!

10:14.512 --> 10:17.504
And they're all like this.

10:17.582 --> 10:19.447
Then I promised Miss Geist

10:19.517 --> 10:22.452
I'd start a letter-writing
campaign to my congressman

10:22.520 --> 10:25.045
about violations of the Clean Air Act.

10:25.123 --> 10:28.957
But Mr. Hall was totally rigid.

10:29.027 --> 10:31.461
He said my debates
were unresearched, unstructured,

10:31.529 --> 10:32.962
and unconvincing.

10:33.031 --> 10:35.022
As if!

10:37.035 --> 10:39.970
I felt impotent and out of control,

10:40.038 --> 10:41.471
which I really hate.

10:41.539 --> 10:43.473
I needed to find sanctuary

10:43.541 --> 10:45.975
in a place where
I could gather my thoughts

10:46.044 --> 10:47.568
and regain my strength.

10:53.551 --> 10:54.813
What's wrong?

10:54.886 --> 10:57.411
Are you suffering from
buyer's remorse or something?

10:57.489 --> 10:58.922
No. Nothing like that.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.423
We've been shopping all day,

11:00.492 --> 11:03.427
and I still don't know
what to do about Mr. Hall.

11:03.495 --> 11:05.429
I've tried everything
to convince him

11:05.497 --> 11:06.930
of my scholastic aptitude,

11:06.998 --> 11:08.932
but I was brutally rebuffed.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.934
He's a miserable little man

11:11.002 --> 11:13.436
who wants to make
everyone else miserable, too.

11:13.505 --> 11:14.938
Dee, that's it!

11:15.006 --> 11:17.440
We've got to figure out a way

11:17.509 --> 11:19.067
to make Mr. Hall sublimely happy.

11:19.144 --> 11:22.443
Here's the 411 on Mr. Hall...

11:22.514 --> 11:23.947
He's single, he's 47,

11:24.015 --> 11:27.451
and he earns minor ducats
at a thankless job.

11:27.519 --> 11:30.818
What that man needs
is a good, healthy boink fest.

11:30.889 --> 11:32.447
Unfortunately,

11:32.524 --> 11:34.958
there was a major
babe drought in my school.

11:35.026 --> 11:37.961
The evil trolls
from the math department

11:38.029 --> 11:39.462
were actually married.

11:39.531 --> 11:40.964
Ooh, Snickers.

11:41.032 --> 11:43.967
And in the grand tradition
of P.E. teachers,

11:44.035 --> 11:46.970
Ms. Stoeger seemed
to be same-sex oriented.

11:47.038 --> 11:50.974
Of course, there was always Miss Geist.

11:51.042 --> 11:54.478
Something told me
not to discount Miss Geist.

11:57.115 --> 12:00.050
Well, sure,
she has runs in her stockings,

12:00.118 --> 12:01.915
and her slip is always showing,

12:01.986 --> 12:04.921
and she has more lipstick
on her teeth than on her mouth.

12:04.989 --> 12:07.924
Popular uprisings from
estates to the general assembly!

12:07.992 --> 12:10.927
God, this woman is
screaming for a makeover.

12:10.995 --> 12:12.428
I'm her only hope.

12:14.566 --> 12:17.899
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

12:17.969 --> 12:20.938
but thy eternal summer
shall not fade."

12:21.005 --> 12:22.438
Did you write that?

12:22.507 --> 12:24.441
Tscha! It's a famous quote.

12:24.509 --> 12:25.441
From where?

12:25.510 --> 12:26.875
Cliffs Notes.

12:30.014 --> 12:32.949
[Miss Geist]
Run along. See you third period.

12:33.017 --> 12:35.383
Try to remember
to bring our textbooks.

13:00.111 --> 13:02.909
Oh, my God!
She actually looked happy.

13:02.981 --> 13:04.380
Classic!

13:04.449 --> 13:09.409

16 tardies to work off.

13:09.487 --> 13:12.718
[Cursing In Foreign Language]

13:12.790 --> 13:16.783
Janet Hong... no tardies.

13:16.861 --> 13:19.421
Travis Birkenstock... 38 tardies.

13:19.497 --> 13:21.431
By far the most tardies in the class.

13:21.499 --> 13:22.932
Congratulations.

13:27.538 --> 13:28.937
This is so unexpected.

13:29.007 --> 13:30.941
I didn't even have a speech prepared.

13:31.009 --> 13:33.443
Uh, but I would like to say this.

13:33.511 --> 13:36.446
Tardiness is not something
you can do all on your own.

13:36.514 --> 13:38.880
Many, many people
contributed to my tardiness.

13:38.950 --> 13:42.044
Thanks to my parents for never
giving me a ride to school,

13:42.120 --> 13:45.954
the L.A. city bus driver for
taking a chance on an unknown kid,

13:46.024 --> 13:48.458
the wonderful crew at McDonald's

13:48.526 --> 13:51.461
for spending hours
making those Egg McMuffins,

13:51.529 --> 13:54.191
without which
I might never be tardy.

13:58.469 --> 14:00.903
If Mr. Birkenstock
has no political messages

14:00.972 --> 14:02.906
to include in his speech,

14:02.974 --> 14:04.407
I'll go on.

14:04.475 --> 14:05.908
Cher Horowitz... two tardies.

14:05.977 --> 14:07.137
I object!

14:07.211 --> 14:09.475
Do you recall the dates
of these alleged tardies?

14:09.547 --> 14:11.447
One was last Monday.

14:11.516 --> 14:14.417
Mr. Hall,
I was surfing the crimson wave.

14:14.485 --> 14:16.612
I had to haul ass to the ladies.

14:16.688 --> 14:18.918
I assume you are referring
to women's troubles,

14:18.990 --> 14:20.651
so I'll let that one slide.

14:20.725 --> 14:22.420
Thank you, Mr. Hall.

14:22.493 --> 14:24.859
Miss Geist was right about you.

14:24.929 --> 14:27.420
What do you mean?

14:27.498 --> 14:29.932
Well, she said that you were

14:30.001 --> 14:33.437
the only one in this school
with any intelligence.

14:37.775 --> 14:39.265
Cher, get in here.

14:39.344 --> 14:41.312
Yes, Daddy?

14:41.379 --> 14:44.007
Will you tell me
what the hell this is?

14:44.082 --> 14:47.483
A second notice for
three outstanding tickets.

14:47.552 --> 14:50.453
I don't remember
getting a first notice.

14:50.521 --> 14:52.455
The ticket is the first notice.

14:52.523 --> 14:54.491
I didn't know you could
get tickets without a license!

14:54.559 --> 14:56.891
Sure you can.
You can get tickets anytime.

14:56.961 --> 14:58.895
Well, not around here you can't.

14:58.963 --> 15:02.296
From this moment on,
you will not drive,

15:02.367 --> 15:04.301
sit, do anything in that Jeep

15:04.369 --> 15:05.996
without a supervised driver.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.901
No cruising around with Dionne.

15:07.972 --> 15:09.803
Two permits do not
equal a license.

15:09.874 --> 15:11.899
Do I make myself clear?

15:11.976 --> 15:13.500
Yes, Daddy.

15:13.578 --> 15:16.172
Cher, I expect you
to become a good driver.

15:16.247 --> 15:19.182
I will. I'm going to
practice real hard.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.886
O.K.

15:22.019 --> 15:24.920
A licensed driver
with nothing to do?

15:24.989 --> 15:27.924
Where would I find such a loser?

15:27.992 --> 15:30.426
Granola breath, you got
something on your chin.

15:30.494 --> 15:31.927
I'm growing a goatee.

15:31.996 --> 15:34.430
You don't want
to be the last one

15:34.498 --> 15:36.432
at the coffeehouse
without chin pubes.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.434
I enjoy these little chats of ours,

15:38.502 --> 15:40.436
but in the interest of saving time,

15:40.504 --> 15:42.438
just tell me what you want.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.440
O.K.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.840
So, actually, I have a permit,

15:46.911 --> 15:49.937
but Daddy says
I can't take the Jeep out

15:50.014 --> 15:51.811
without a licensed driver.

15:51.882 --> 15:53.611
Since you're not doing anything...

15:53.684 --> 15:55.652
What are the chances
of you shutting up

15:55.719 --> 15:57.380
till you get your way?

15:57.454 --> 15:58.887
Slim to none.

15:58.956 --> 16:01.254
Come on.

16:01.325 --> 16:02.883
Hey, James Bond.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.690
In America, we drive
on the right side of the road.

16:05.763 --> 16:08.357
I am. You try driving in platforms.

16:08.432 --> 16:10.400
I got to get back to school.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.094
Want to practice parking?

16:12.169 --> 16:15.002
What's the point?
Everywhere you go has valet.

16:15.072 --> 16:17.404
What class you going to?

16:17.474 --> 16:19.999
Actually, I'm going
to a Tree People meeting.

16:20.077 --> 16:23.410
We might get Marky Mark
to plant a celebrity tree.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.913
How fabulous.

16:24.982 --> 16:27.416
Getting Marky Mark to take time

16:27.484 --> 16:29.418
from his busy
pants-dropping schedule

16:29.486 --> 16:30.919
to plant trees.

16:30.988 --> 16:32.615
Why don't you hire a gardener?

16:32.690 --> 16:35.921
Maybe Marky Mark
wants to use his popularity

16:35.993 --> 16:38.791
for a good cause,
make a contribution.

16:38.862 --> 16:41.797
In case you've
never heard of that,

16:41.865 --> 16:43.423
a contribution is...

16:43.500 --> 16:45.434
I have donated
many Italian outfits to Lucy.

16:45.502 --> 16:47.936
As soon as I get my license,

16:48.005 --> 16:49.939
I fully intend
to brake for animals,

16:50.007 --> 16:51.941
and I have contributed many hours

16:52.009 --> 16:54.944
to helping two lonely teachers
find romance.

16:55.012 --> 16:57.378
Which I'll bet serves
your interests more than theirs.

16:57.448 --> 17:00.383
If I ever saw you do anything
that wasn't 90% selfish,

17:00.451 --> 17:01.884
I'd die of shock.

17:01.952 --> 17:04.546
Oh, that would be
reason enough for me.

17:08.959 --> 17:10.893
Would you call me selfish?

17:10.961 --> 17:12.895
No. Not to your face.

17:12.963 --> 17:14.396
Really?

17:14.464 --> 17:16.398
Is Josh giving you shit

17:16.467 --> 17:18.901
because he's in
his postadolescent idealistic phase?

17:18.969 --> 17:20.367
Look, there's Mr. Hall.

17:20.436 --> 17:22.405
Mr. Hall! Mr. Hall!

17:22.473 --> 17:24.406
Um, do you drink coffee?

17:24.474 --> 17:26.409
Not from this cafeteria.

17:26.477 --> 17:28.911
Yes, under normal circumstances.

17:28.979 --> 17:30.913
I am such a retard.

17:30.981 --> 17:32.915
When I was packing Daddy's lunch,

17:32.983 --> 17:34.917
I gave him my lemon Snapple

17:34.985 --> 17:36.919
and took his sucky Italian roast.

17:36.987 --> 17:38.921
Do you want it?

17:38.989 --> 17:40.923
You sure you don't want it?

17:40.991 --> 17:42.925
Tscha! It might stunt my growth.

17:42.993 --> 17:44.426
I want to be 5'10
like Cindy Crawford.

17:44.495 --> 17:46.929
But I thought you or Miss Geist
might like it.

17:46.997 --> 17:48.931
Maybe you could share it.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.432
Well... thanks.

17:50.501 --> 17:51.934
Sure.

17:55.606 --> 17:57.335
- Miss Geist!
- Miss Geist!

17:57.408 --> 17:59.569
Did you sign up
for the environmental fair?

17:59.643 --> 18:00.871
We will.

18:00.944 --> 18:02.878
You have pretty eyes.
Don't hide them.

18:02.946 --> 18:04.880
These clips are so cute.

18:04.948 --> 18:06.882
And this tiny little waist.

18:06.950 --> 18:08.383
Look. Wow.

18:08.452 --> 18:09.919
Girls.

18:09.987 --> 18:14.424
Oh, don't forget to sign up
for the environmental fair.

18:14.491 --> 18:17.392
Not a total Betty,
but a vast improvement.

18:17.461 --> 18:18.894
We did our best.

18:18.962 --> 18:21.157
We got to book to P.E.

18:21.231 --> 18:22.664
Come on, Dee.

18:22.733 --> 18:24.394
I feel like bailing, dude.

18:24.468 --> 18:27.403
I know what you mean,
but at least it's exercise.

18:27.471 --> 18:29.905
I feel like such a heifer.

18:29.973 --> 18:32.407
I had two bowls of Special K,

18:32.476 --> 18:33.909
three pieces of turkey bacon,

18:33.977 --> 18:35.410
five peanut butter M&M's,

18:35.479 --> 18:36.912
and, like, three pieces of licorice.

18:36.980 --> 18:38.174
Oh, my God. Look.

18:38.248 --> 18:41.411
Is that a photo op or what?

18:41.485 --> 18:43.419
Look at that body language...

18:43.487 --> 18:45.921
Legs crossed towards each other.

18:45.989 --> 18:47.980
That's an unequivocal sex invite.

18:51.895 --> 18:54.022
Oh, Cher, he's getting her digits.

18:54.098 --> 18:56.464
Look at Geist. She is so cute.

18:56.533 --> 18:57.864
Ohh.

18:57.935 --> 19:01.371
Old people can be so sweet.

19:06.610 --> 19:09.875
? The world is full of fools?

19:09.947 --> 19:13.747
? Who never get it right?

19:13.817 --> 19:17.378
? You don't know what to do?

19:17.454 --> 19:22.050
? So you do anything you like?

19:22.126 --> 19:24.390
? Put your feet in drive?

19:24.461 --> 19:26.395
? Oh, you're a silly thing?

19:26.463 --> 19:27.657
? Put your feet in drive?

19:27.731 --> 19:30.199
? You're such a pretty thing?

19:38.108 --> 19:39.905
? You're going out tonight?

19:41.478 --> 19:43.275
? There's nothing to lose...??

19:43.347 --> 19:46.407
The entire student body
was utterly grateful

19:46.483 --> 19:49.418
for the improvement
in their grades.

19:49.486 --> 19:53.422
? Don't ever change?

19:53.490 --> 19:57.426
? Don't ever change?

19:57.494 --> 20:01.430
? No, never change??

20:05.502 --> 20:07.436
Cher, what's this all about?

20:07.504 --> 20:08.937
My report card?

20:09.006 --> 20:10.439
The same semester?

20:10.507 --> 20:11.940
Uh-huh.

20:12.009 --> 20:14.443
What did you do?
Turn in extra credit?

20:14.511 --> 20:15.944
No.

20:16.013 --> 20:17.446
Take the midterms over?

20:17.514 --> 20:18.947
Uh-uh.

20:19.016 --> 20:20.950
You mean to tell me

20:21.018 --> 20:25.455
that you argued your way
from a C-plus to an A-minus?

20:25.522 --> 20:28.457
Totally based
on my powers of persuasion.

20:28.525 --> 20:29.958
You proud?

20:30.027 --> 20:34.464
I couldn't be happier
if they were based on real grades.

20:34.531 --> 20:36.396
Fabulous.

20:39.036 --> 20:43.973
I felt so satisfied,
I wanted to do more good deeds.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.975
Ah-choo!

20:46.043 --> 20:47.977
Dee, when your allergies act up,

20:48.045 --> 20:49.808
take out your nose ring.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.973
Follow through! There you go.

20:52.049 --> 20:53.482
There you go.

20:53.550 --> 20:54.915
All right, Cher!

20:54.985 --> 20:58.352
Earth to Cher. Come in, Cher.

21:01.491 --> 21:03.425
Ms. Stoeger...

21:03.493 --> 21:05.427
I would just like to say

21:05.495 --> 21:08.931
that physical education
in this school is a disgrace.

21:08.999 --> 21:11.433
I mean, standing in line
for 40 minutes

21:11.501 --> 21:12.934
is hardly aerobically effective.

21:13.003 --> 21:14.937
I doubt I worked off the calories

21:15.005 --> 21:16.666
in a stick of Carefree gum.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.901
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

21:18.976 --> 21:20.705
You exercised your mouth, Cher.

21:20.777 --> 21:22.210
Hit the ball.

21:25.015 --> 21:26.448
Ms. Stoeger,

21:26.516 --> 21:28.746
that machine is just
a lawsuit waiting to happen.

21:28.819 --> 21:30.286
Thanks for the legal advice.

21:30.354 --> 21:33.118
Dionne, you're up.

21:33.190 --> 21:35.454
I have a note from
my tennis instructor

21:35.525 --> 21:37.959
saying I shouldn't expose myself
to any training

21:38.028 --> 21:39.689
that might derail his teachings.

21:39.763 --> 21:41.458
Fine.

21:41.531 --> 21:43.863
Amber!

21:43.934 --> 21:46.960
My plastic surgeon doesn't
want me doing any activity

21:47.037 --> 21:49.471
where balls fly at my nose.

21:49.539 --> 21:51.268
Well, there goes your social life.

21:51.341 --> 21:54.469
[Man]
Ms. Stoeger...

21:54.544 --> 21:56.478
got another one.

21:56.546 --> 21:59.413
Ladies, we have
a new student with us.

21:59.483 --> 22:00.973
This is Tai Frasier.

22:03.654 --> 22:07.146
You could hit a few balls
in those clothes.

22:07.224 --> 22:11.320
She could be a farmer
in those clothes.

22:11.395 --> 22:14.421
Dee, my mission is clear.

22:14.498 --> 22:16.432
Would you look at that girl?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.434
She is so adorably clueless.

22:18.502 --> 22:20.436
We've got to adopt her.

22:20.504 --> 22:21.903
She is toe up.

22:21.972 --> 22:23.439
Our stock would plummet.

22:23.507 --> 22:27.273
Don't you want to use
your popularity for a good cause?

22:27.344 --> 22:28.276
No.

22:28.345 --> 22:30.210
Come here! Yeah, come here.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.770
Hang with us.

22:31.848 --> 22:33.247
Oh, thank you.

22:33.317 --> 22:35.285
How do you like California?

22:35.352 --> 22:36.944
Man, I'm freakin'.

22:37.020 --> 22:40.183
I could really use some sort
of herbal refreshment.

22:40.257 --> 22:42.452
We do lunch in 10 minutes.

22:42.526 --> 22:45.461
We don't have any tea,
but we have Coke.

22:45.529 --> 22:47.121
You guys got coke here?

22:47.197 --> 22:48.630
Yeah. This is America.

22:50.233 --> 22:52.463
So we decided to show Tai

22:52.536 --> 22:54.504
the ropes at Bronson Alcott High School.

22:54.571 --> 22:56.937
That is Alana's group over there.

22:57.007 --> 22:58.709
They do the TV station.

22:58.842 --> 23:00.901
They think that's the most
important thing on Earth.

23:00.977 --> 23:02.706
And that's the Persian Mafia.

23:02.779 --> 23:05.646
You can't hang with them
unless you own a BMW.

23:05.716 --> 23:07.911
There's Elton in the white vest,

23:07.984 --> 23:09.952
with all the most popular boys.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.420
Including my boyfriend.
Ain't he cute?

23:12.489 --> 23:14.923
If you decide
to date a high school boy,

23:14.991 --> 23:16.424
they're the only acceptable ones.

23:16.493 --> 23:18.427
Which one of them's your boyfriend?

23:18.495 --> 23:19.928
As if!

23:19.996 --> 23:21.930
Cher's got attitude
about high school boys.

23:21.998 --> 23:23.431
It's a personal choice

23:23.500 --> 23:25.934
every woman has got
to make for herself.

23:26.002 --> 23:27.435
Woman, lend me $5.00.

23:27.504 --> 23:29.938
Murray, I have asked you repeatedly

23:30.006 --> 23:31.633
not to call me woman.

23:31.708 --> 23:33.107
Excuse me, Miss Dionne,

23:33.176 --> 23:36.441
street slang is an increasingly
valid form of expression.

23:36.513 --> 23:38.947
Most feminine pronouns
do have mocking

23:39.015 --> 23:41.882
but not necessarily
misogynistic undertone.

23:41.952 --> 23:44.443
Wow. You guys talk like grownups.

23:44.521 --> 23:47.217
Well, this is a really good school.

23:47.290 --> 23:50.953
I'm going to go get a soda.
Do you guys want?

23:51.027 --> 23:52.688
Sure.

23:52.763 --> 23:54.162
She's nice.

23:54.231 --> 23:56.096
Ooh! Project!

24:04.474 --> 24:05.907
Oh, wow.

24:05.976 --> 24:06.908
That's disgusting.

24:06.977 --> 24:08.410
[Giggles]

24:08.478 --> 24:10.912
That's a nice representation.

24:10.981 --> 24:11.913
Thanks.

24:11.982 --> 24:13.540
Those are really nice stickers.

24:13.617 --> 24:16.415
I was thinking it was too cluttered.

24:16.486 --> 24:18.420
I want to concentrate on

24:18.488 --> 24:19.921
one main decorative statement,

24:19.990 --> 24:22.015
like Marvin the Martian right there.

24:22.092 --> 24:24.458
I can do Marvin the Martian.

24:24.528 --> 24:25.495
Really?

24:25.562 --> 24:28.395
I mean there's not
really a lot to him,

24:28.465 --> 24:30.933
but you want to see?

24:31.001 --> 24:32.491
Yeah.

24:32.569 --> 24:34.434
That's really cool.

24:34.504 --> 24:36.438
Thanks.

24:36.506 --> 24:40.135
Wait. I got one here.

24:40.210 --> 24:41.939
You didn't trace these?

24:42.012 --> 24:43.445
Uh-uh. No.

24:43.513 --> 24:45.378
Here's another one over here...

24:45.448 --> 24:48.144
and lots of little guys.

24:48.218 --> 24:49.947
That is so cute.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.954
You're really good at it.

24:52.022 --> 24:52.954
No.

24:53.023 --> 24:54.456
No, really. You are.

24:54.524 --> 24:55.957
Yeah.

24:56.026 --> 24:57.891
Are you sure that's fat free?

24:57.961 --> 24:59.394
Oh, yes.

24:59.462 --> 25:01.896
And you lose weight
by cutting it small.

25:02.966 --> 25:05.400
I met a really cool guy.

25:05.468 --> 25:06.901
Describe.

25:06.970 --> 25:08.403
He's got long hair.

25:08.471 --> 25:11.406
Straight off he offers me some smoke.

25:11.474 --> 25:12.998
There he is!

25:14.711 --> 25:16.906
Are you talking about drugs?

25:16.980 --> 25:18.413
Yeah.

25:18.481 --> 25:20.915
Tai, how old are you?

25:20.984 --> 25:22.918
I'll be 16 in May.

25:22.986 --> 25:24.920
My birthday's in April,
and as someone older,

25:24.988 --> 25:26.922
can I please give you some advice?

25:26.990 --> 25:29.925
It is one thing
to spark up a doobie at parties,

25:29.993 --> 25:32.427
but it is another
to be fried all day.

25:32.495 --> 25:33.928
Do you see the distinction?

25:33.997 --> 25:36.158
Yeah.

25:36.233 --> 25:38.599
Loadies generally hang
on the grassy knoll.

25:38.668 --> 25:41.432
Sometimes they come to class
and say bonehead things,

25:41.504 --> 25:43.028
and we all laugh, of course,

25:43.106 --> 25:46.166
but no respectable girl
actually dates them.

25:46.243 --> 25:47.938
You don't want to start off

25:48.011 --> 25:49.706
on the wrong foot, do you?

25:49.779 --> 25:51.212
I've got an idea.

25:51.281 --> 25:52.942
Let's do a makeover.

25:53.016 --> 25:54.108
[Gasp]

25:54.184 --> 25:55.947
No. No.

25:56.019 --> 26:00.956
Cher's main thrill
in life is a makeover.

26:01.024 --> 26:02.889
It gives her a sense of control
in a chaotic world.

26:02.959 --> 26:04.654
Please?

26:04.728 --> 26:08.391
Sure. Why not?

26:08.465 --> 26:12.595
You guys, I've never had
straight friends before.

26:21.044 --> 26:24.639
? I don't care?

26:24.714 --> 26:27.512
? What my teachers say?

26:27.584 --> 26:30.712
? I'm gonna be a supermodel?

26:30.787 --> 26:32.516
? And everyone?

26:32.589 --> 26:34.853
? Is gonna dress like me?

26:34.925 --> 26:36.324
? Wait and see?

26:36.393 --> 26:38.987
? When I'm a supermodel?

26:39.062 --> 26:43.021
? And my hair will shine like the sea?

26:44.601 --> 26:47.092
? And everyone?

26:47.170 --> 26:48.933
? Will want to look?

26:49.005 --> 26:50.996
? Just like me?

26:51.074 --> 26:53.099
? Eeee?

26:53.176 --> 26:55.644
? 'Cause I'm young?

26:55.712 --> 26:57.236
? I'm hip?

26:57.314 --> 27:00.374
? And so beautiful?

27:00.450 --> 27:03.248
? I'm going to be a supermodel??

27:03.320 --> 27:06.118
Squeeze your buttocks when you come up.

27:06.189 --> 27:07.622
Squeeze in.

27:07.691 --> 27:09.886
I don't want to do this anymore.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.394
My buns don't feel
nothing like steel.

27:12.462 --> 27:14.896
O.K. It will get easier.
I promise.

27:14.965 --> 27:18.901
Just as long as
we do it every day, not sporadically.

27:18.969 --> 27:21.699
How do you know
if we're doing it sporadically?

27:21.771 --> 27:25.468
We've got to work
on your accent and vocabulary.

27:25.542 --> 27:27.373
Sporadic means once in a while.

27:27.444 --> 27:29.309
Use it in a sentence today.

27:29.379 --> 27:31.404
From now on,

27:31.481 --> 27:32.914
we're alternating
Cindy Crawford's Aerobicize

27:32.983 --> 27:34.416
and Buns Of Steel

27:34.484 --> 27:36.918
and reading one
nonschool book a week.

27:36.987 --> 27:39.421
My first book is Fit Or Fat.

27:39.489 --> 27:42.925
Mine is Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus.

27:42.993 --> 27:44.460
Good.

27:44.527 --> 27:46.324
That takes care
of our minds and bodies,

27:46.396 --> 27:49.160
but we should do
something good for mankind

27:49.232 --> 27:51.132
for a couple of hours.

27:51.201 --> 27:53.396
Hey, brainiac.

27:53.470 --> 27:54.767
Ugh. The dreaded ex.

27:54.838 --> 27:56.135
Tai, this is Josh.

27:56.206 --> 27:57.935
Nice to meet you.

27:58.008 --> 27:59.566
Hey! You know about this stuff.

27:59.642 --> 28:02.577
I want to do something
good for humanity.

28:02.645 --> 28:04.135
How about sterilization?

28:04.214 --> 28:06.239
Ha ha ha!

28:08.985 --> 28:10.384
So what do you think?

28:10.453 --> 28:11.886
I'm amazed.

28:11.955 --> 28:14.890
That I am devoting myself
so generously to someone else?

28:14.958 --> 28:17.893
That you found someone
more clueless than you are

28:17.961 --> 28:19.394
to worship you.

28:19.462 --> 28:21.396
I am rescuing her from teenage hell.

28:21.464 --> 28:22.897
The wounds of adolescence

28:22.966 --> 28:24.900
can take years to heal.

28:24.968 --> 28:26.401
You've never had a mother.

28:26.469 --> 28:28.403
You're acting out on that poor girl

28:28.471 --> 28:29.904
like your Barbie doll.

28:29.973 --> 28:31.406
Freshman Psych.

28:31.474 --> 28:33.408
I am not taking Psych.

28:33.476 --> 28:35.410
I am going to take that lost soul

28:35.478 --> 28:37.912
and make her well-dressed and popular.

28:37.981 --> 28:40.415
Her life will be better
because of me.

28:40.483 --> 28:42.951
How many girls can
say that about you?

28:43.019 --> 28:45.385
? Mentos better?

28:45.455 --> 28:47.184
? Mentos fresher?

28:47.257 --> 28:48.622
? Fresh goes better?

28:48.691 --> 28:50.921
? With Mentos,
fresh and full of life!??

28:50.994 --> 28:52.427
[Television]
Mentos.

28:52.495 --> 28:53.689
The freshmaker.

28:53.763 --> 28:55.230
Be seeing ya.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.822
Yeah, I hope not sporadically.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.375
Do you see how boys
are responding?

29:06.443 --> 29:08.377
My heart is totally bursting.

29:08.445 --> 29:09.878
I know!

29:09.946 --> 29:11.379
Cher, you have Deamer?

29:11.448 --> 29:12.881
Geist.

29:12.949 --> 29:14.883
Hey, Tai, did you get a flyer?

29:14.951 --> 29:16.384
Uh-uh.

29:16.453 --> 29:17.886
Wow! A party!

29:17.954 --> 29:19.387
It's in the Valley.

29:19.456 --> 29:21.549
The cops usually break them up
in less than an hour,

29:21.624 --> 29:22.955
and it takes that long to get there.

29:23.026 --> 29:24.994
It's just local loadies.

29:25.061 --> 29:27.120
Do you guys think
Travis will be there?

29:27.197 --> 29:28.892
I thought we moved
on from there.

29:28.965 --> 29:30.626
Don't sell yourself short.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.100
You've got something no one here has.

29:33.169 --> 29:35.069
I'm not a virgin.

29:35.138 --> 29:37.106
As far as everyone's concerned,

29:37.173 --> 29:38.902
you're the most popular girl
in your school.

29:38.975 --> 29:41.910
The fact that you hang
with Dee and l, well...

29:41.978 --> 29:43.411
Speaks very highly of you.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.414
If you strike
while the iron is hot,

29:45.482 --> 29:47.416
you can have any guy
that you want.

29:47.484 --> 29:48.917
Like who?

29:48.985 --> 29:50.418
Who's available?

29:50.487 --> 29:51.920
There's Bronson...

29:51.988 --> 29:53.421
I got it! Elton!

29:53.490 --> 29:54.923
He just broke up with Folette!

29:54.991 --> 29:56.424
Who's Elton?

29:56.493 --> 29:57.926
He's way popular,

29:57.994 --> 29:59.928
like the social director of the Crew.

29:59.996 --> 30:01.930
His dad can get you into any concert.

30:01.998 --> 30:03.932
I noticed him scoping you out.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.433
He was looking at me?

30:05.502 --> 30:06.935

your arm around Tai?

through my laundry?

wear something from Judy's.

Actually, if you
take Wilshire to Canon,

39:03.438 --> 39:04.973
that turns into Benedict.

on your way up to Sunset.

? I believe I'm you?

01:01:52.472 --> 01:01:53.666
? You know it's true??

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.401
Oh... l'm still all red!

01:01:55.475 --> 01:01:59.912
I'm trying to make you
as white as I can, Cher.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.413
Look, you're all flushed.

01:02:01.481 --> 01:02:03.915
You have to calm down, O.K.?

01:02:03.984 --> 01:02:05.349
Calm.

01:02:05.419 --> 01:02:08.855
You know, I am so glad I never did it

01:02:08.922 --> 01:02:11.356
with someone I had lukewarm feelings for

01:02:11.425 --> 01:02:12.858
because Christian is brutally hot,

01:02:12.926 --> 01:02:15.360
and I am going to
remember tonight forever.

01:02:15.429 --> 01:02:16.521
Blot.

01:02:18.065 --> 01:02:19.362
[Ding-dong]

01:02:23.937 --> 01:02:25.370
Hi.

01:02:25.439 --> 01:02:26.872
Hi.

01:02:28.942 --> 01:02:31.376
Is something burning?

01:02:31.445 --> 01:02:32.878
Oh, my God!

01:02:39.953 --> 01:02:41.386
Oops.

01:02:41.455 --> 01:02:43.889
Aw, honey, you baked.

01:02:43.957 --> 01:02:45.891
I tried.

01:02:45.959 --> 01:02:49.395
Come on. Show me
the rest of your pad.

01:02:51.765 --> 01:02:54.700
Your father has
a well-rounded collection.

01:02:54.768 --> 01:02:56.895
Daddy says it's a good investment.

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:58.403
He's absolutely right.

01:02:58.472 --> 01:02:59.404
Claes Oldenburg.

01:02:59.473 --> 01:03:01.407
He's way famous.

01:03:01.475 --> 01:03:02.908
Ooh.

01:03:02.976 --> 01:03:05.342
But this is older, see?

01:03:05.412 --> 01:03:06.845
Transitional.

01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:08.847
A very important piece.

01:03:08.915 --> 01:03:11.349
Um, you want to go swimming?

01:03:11.418 --> 01:03:13.852
Mmm.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.353
Let's watch the movies.

01:03:15.422 --> 01:03:17.219
Oh, O.K.

01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.851
Christian had a thing for Tony Curtis,

01:03:19.926 --> 01:03:22.360
so he brought over Some Like It Hot

01:03:22.429 --> 01:03:23.760
and Sparatacus.

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.354
Singer of songs.

01:03:25.432 --> 01:03:28.924
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

01:03:29.002 --> 01:03:31.436
For the children of my master,

01:03:31.505 --> 01:03:33.564
whom I also taught the classics.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.369
Classics, indeed?

01:03:35.442 --> 01:03:37.171
What position have we, I wonder,

01:03:37.244 --> 01:03:40.839
for a boy of such varied gifts?

01:03:42.282 --> 01:03:44.716
You shall be my body servant.

01:03:44.785 --> 01:03:46.377
All of you, come with me.

01:03:48.955 --> 01:03:51.116
My feet are cold.

01:03:57.664 --> 01:04:00.428
Huh. Thanks.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.933
Oh, watch this part.

01:04:02.002 --> 01:04:03.902
This is good.

01:04:06.406 --> 01:04:07.839
Are you O.K.?

01:04:07.908 --> 01:04:09.341
Uh, I'm fine.

01:04:09.409 --> 01:04:11.843
Um, do you want some...
something to drink?

01:04:11.912 --> 01:04:13.470
I could get you some wine.

01:04:13.547 --> 01:04:16.345
No. You notice how wine makes people

01:04:16.416 --> 01:04:18.350
want to feel, like, sexy?

01:04:18.418 --> 01:04:20.352
Well, that's O.K.

01:04:23.423 --> 01:04:26.358
I'm actually getting tired.

01:04:27.761 --> 01:04:30.855
But I can make you
some coffee if you'd like.

01:04:30.931 --> 01:04:32.865
Oh, no, thanks. Got the ulcer.

01:04:32.933 --> 01:04:36.369
But you had all
those cappuccinos before.

01:04:36.436 --> 01:04:40.634
Oh. Well, you know,
that was, like, uh, foam.

01:04:45.445 --> 01:04:46.878
You're great.

01:04:46.947 --> 01:04:49.381
We're friends, right?

01:04:49.449 --> 01:04:50.882
Yeah.

01:04:52.285 --> 01:04:55.379
Knock me a little kiss.

01:04:55.455 --> 01:04:56.888
See you.

01:05:01.962 --> 01:05:03.896
I don't get it.

01:05:03.964 --> 01:05:05.829
Did my hair get flat?

01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:08.333
Did I stumble into
some bad lighting?

01:05:08.402 --> 01:05:10.370
What's wrong with me?

01:05:10.437 --> 01:05:11.836
Nothing.

01:05:11.905 --> 01:05:13.167
Maybe he really was tired.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.333
I suppose it wasn't meant to be.

01:05:15.409 --> 01:05:17.343
He does dress better than I do.

01:05:17.411 --> 01:05:19.345
What would I bring
to the relationship?

01:05:19.413 --> 01:05:20.573
Get back into the right lane...

01:05:20.647 --> 01:05:22.080
What's the first thing you do?

01:05:22.149 --> 01:05:24.344
First thing I do
is put on my blinker.

01:05:24.418 --> 01:05:27.854
- Oh, wait. Shit.
- Watch the road!

01:05:27.921 --> 01:05:31.357
Stop. Then I look
in my mirror. O.K.

01:05:31.425 --> 01:05:35.020
Then I glance
at my blind spot.

01:05:35.095 --> 01:05:37.620
With your head,
not the whole car!

01:05:37.697 --> 01:05:40.359
I swear to God.
I swear to God, woman!

01:05:40.434 --> 01:05:41.765
You can't drive for shit!

01:05:41.835 --> 01:05:43.234
I'm not trying to hear that.

01:05:43.303 --> 01:05:44.736
Hear me! You...

01:05:44.805 --> 01:05:46.170
Actually, going all the way

01:05:46.239 --> 01:05:48.366
is, like, a really big decision.

01:05:48.442 --> 01:05:51.377
I can't believe I was
so capricious about it.

01:05:51.445 --> 01:05:53.037
Dee, I almost had sex with him.

01:05:53.113 --> 01:05:54.444
You almost had sex with who?

01:05:54.514 --> 01:05:55.742
Christian.

01:05:57.484 --> 01:05:59.975
What?

01:06:00.053 --> 01:06:02.988
Yo, look!
Are you bitches blind or something?

01:06:03.056 --> 01:06:04.614
Your man Christian is a cake boy.

01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:05.783
- A what?
- A what?

01:06:05.859 --> 01:06:08.123
He's a disco-dancing,
Oscar-Wilde-reading,

01:06:08.195 --> 01:06:10.891
Streisand ticket-holding
friend of Dorothy.

01:06:10.964 --> 01:06:12.829
Uh-uh. No way.

01:06:12.899 --> 01:06:13.831
He's gay.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.832
Not even.

01:06:14.901 --> 01:06:15.833
Yes, even.

01:06:15.902 --> 01:06:17.961
He does like to shop, Cher,

01:06:18.038 --> 01:06:19.665
and the boy can dress.

01:06:19.739 --> 01:06:22.173
Oh, my God.
I'm totally buggin'.

01:06:22.242 --> 01:06:25.109
I feel like such a bonehead.

01:06:25.178 --> 01:06:26.611
What the hell?

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.238
Yo! You're getting on the freeway!

01:06:28.315 --> 01:06:29.976
Turn right! Get out of the lane!

01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:32.951
No, no! Forget procedure!
Get out of the lane!

01:06:33.019 --> 01:06:35.681
Truck! Truck! Truck!

01:06:35.755 --> 01:06:36.847
[Horn Honking]

01:06:36.923 --> 01:06:38.652
We're on the freeway!

01:06:38.725 --> 01:06:40.158
What do I do, Murray?

01:06:40.227 --> 01:06:42.661
Go straight! Go straight!
Go straight!

01:06:42.729 --> 01:06:43.696
Oh, shit!

01:06:43.763 --> 01:06:45.196
Just relax and drive, baby.

01:06:45.265 --> 01:06:46.391
Just relax and drive.

01:06:46.466 --> 01:06:48.263
O.K.

01:06:48.335 --> 01:06:50.803
I'm here with you. I'm here with you.

01:06:50.871 --> 01:06:52.634
Shut up!

01:06:52.706 --> 01:06:54.674
Aah!

01:06:54.741 --> 01:06:57.301
Aah!

01:06:57.377 --> 01:06:59.504
Aah!

01:06:59.579 --> 01:07:01.012
Whatever you do,

01:07:01.081 --> 01:07:03.709
keep your hands
on the wheel at all times!

01:07:03.783 --> 01:07:05.876
Aah!

01:07:05.952 --> 01:07:08.443
[Horn Honking]

01:07:11.558 --> 01:07:12.991
Look, just go!

01:07:13.059 --> 01:07:15.118
Aah!

01:07:15.195 --> 01:07:16.628
Go to the right!

01:07:16.696 --> 01:07:18.129
Oh, there it is.

01:07:18.198 --> 01:07:19.631
All right, we're off.

01:07:19.699 --> 01:07:21.326
Woo!

01:07:21.401 --> 01:07:23.335
Damn. You did wonderful.

01:07:23.403 --> 01:07:26.531
It's all right, baby.
Relax, relax, relax.

01:07:26.606 --> 01:07:29.074
Honey, relax. Baby, relax.

01:07:29.142 --> 01:07:31.133
Breathe, breathe.
Breathe in. Breathe.

01:07:31.211 --> 01:07:32.838
Let it out.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:07:32.913 --> 01:07:34.744
Relax, relax.

01:07:34.814 --> 01:07:37.840
Boy, getting off the freeway
makes you realize

01:07:37.918 --> 01:07:39.719
how important love is.

01:07:39.852 --> 01:07:41.149
After that, Dionne's virginity

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.347
went from technical to nonexistent.

01:07:43.422 --> 01:07:48.052
I realized how much I wanted
a boyfriend of my own.

01:07:48.127 --> 01:07:51.358
Not that Christian wasn't
a blast to hang out with.

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:54.365
He was becoming one of
my favorite shopping partners.

01:07:54.433 --> 01:07:55.866
So was the red.

01:07:57.436 --> 01:07:58.869
Um, where's Tai?

01:07:58.938 --> 01:08:01.372
She met some random guys
at the Foot Locker

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.340
and escorted them right over there.

01:08:03.409 --> 01:08:04.876
Oh, my God! Did you...

01:08:04.944 --> 01:08:06.809
I don't know where
she meets these Barneys.

01:08:06.879 --> 01:08:08.312
I have a question, all right?

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.472
What?

01:08:09.548 --> 01:08:10.810
The jacket...

01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:13.818
Is it James Dean
or Jason Priestley?

01:08:13.886 --> 01:08:15.319
Carpe diem, O.K.?

01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:17.149
You looked hot in it.

01:08:17.223 --> 01:08:18.281
Really?

01:08:18.357 --> 01:08:20.848
If I fall, would you guys catch me?

01:08:20.926 --> 01:08:23.326
Could they please be more generic?

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.894
Aah! Stop it!

01:08:26.966 --> 01:08:27.955
Please!

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:29.694
Bring me back up!

01:08:29.769 --> 01:08:31.100
Aah!

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:33.229
Aah!

01:08:33.305 --> 01:08:35.830
Let me down!

01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:37.341
Thank you.

01:08:37.408 --> 01:08:38.341
You asshole!

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:40.344
Hey, man, we're just joking.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:41.845
Oh, really?

01:08:41.913 --> 01:08:43.541
Somebody could get killed.

01:08:43.616 --> 01:08:47.381
Oh, my God.
Cher, you don't understand.

01:08:47.453 --> 01:08:49.353
I was sitting there.
I was just talking to those guys.

01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:51.854
All of a sudden,
we were laughing and...

01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:53.015
Hey, you O.K.?

01:08:53.091 --> 01:08:54.184
Y-yeah.

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.352
You sure?

01:08:55.426 --> 01:08:56.519
I'm fine. Uh-huh.

01:08:56.595 --> 01:08:58.859
Let's get you home for some R and R.

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:00.363
What's that?

01:09:01.934 --> 01:09:04.368
Boy, considering
how clueless she was,

01:09:04.435 --> 01:09:08.270
Tai certainly had
that damsel-in-distress act down.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.773
Meanwhile, back at school,

01:09:09.841 --> 01:09:11.274
everyone was talking about

01:09:11.343 --> 01:09:13.810
Tai's brush with death at the mall.

01:09:13.879 --> 01:09:17.314
Was it a montage of all the scenes
in your life?

01:09:17.383 --> 01:09:19.145
Not exactly a montage.

01:09:19.218 --> 01:09:22.813
Hey, Cher, is it true gang members
tried to shoot Tai?

01:09:22.888 --> 01:09:23.979
No.

01:09:24.055 --> 01:09:25.488
That's what everyone's saying.

01:09:25.558 --> 01:09:26.819
Whatever.

01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:31.821
When I was 9,
I fell off this jungle gym.

01:09:31.897 --> 01:09:34.331
I swear I saw this...

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:36.334
Will you move down for Cher?

01:09:36.402 --> 01:09:38.336
Tell me more. Tell me more.

01:09:38.404 --> 01:09:39.837
Where was I?

01:09:39.904 --> 01:09:42.339
You were thinking about
what was really important.

01:09:42.408 --> 01:09:43.841
Oh, right, right.

01:09:43.908 --> 01:09:45.341
Right before you die,

01:09:45.411 --> 01:09:47.379
your mind just
sort of gets very clear.

01:09:47.446 --> 01:09:49.845
It's a very intense spiritual thing.

01:09:49.915 --> 01:09:52.349
I know when I was held
at gunpoint...

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:53.850
Excuse me. You were saying?

01:09:53.919 --> 01:09:55.011
It's spiritual.

01:09:55.087 --> 01:09:57.021
I can't pinpoint the spirituality.

01:09:57.089 --> 01:10:00.616
If you've never
experienced anything...

01:10:00.693 --> 01:10:03.218
Tai, I was planning on going to Tower
and getting something for Christian.

01:10:03.295 --> 01:10:04.557
Uh-huh.

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:06.894
Like some kind
of present or something.

01:10:06.966 --> 01:10:10.060
- You want to come?
- Sure. I owe him my life.

01:10:10.135 --> 01:10:11.534
I'll get you after school.

01:10:11.604 --> 01:10:12.696
Yeah.

01:10:12.771 --> 01:10:15.569
Not today. I'm going
over to Melrose with Amber.

01:10:15.641 --> 01:10:17.336
We're going to Melrose.

01:10:17.409 --> 01:10:20.845
Oh. Well, how about tomorrow?

01:10:20.913 --> 01:10:23.814
Do you think we could
do it next Monday?

01:10:23.883 --> 01:10:25.817
My week's filling up fast here.

01:10:25.885 --> 01:10:29.184
When we got back
from the IHOP, it was 8:00.

01:10:29.255 --> 01:10:30.688
Here comes your boyfriend.

01:10:30.756 --> 01:10:33.316
Tai, check it out.

01:10:33.392 --> 01:10:34.825
- Ew!
- Ew!

01:10:34.894 --> 01:10:37.328
Hey, could you shove down
a little bit?

01:10:37.396 --> 01:10:38.829
No.

01:10:38.898 --> 01:10:40.331
Don't the slackers prefer

01:10:40.399 --> 01:10:42.333
that grassy knoll over there?

01:10:49.408 --> 01:10:54.004
Tai, so anyway,
have you ever done it in water?

01:10:54.079 --> 01:10:55.512
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

01:10:55.581 --> 01:10:58.516
What was happening?

01:10:58.584 --> 01:11:01.451
Dionne asking Tai for sex advice?

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.047
Tai being the most popular girl
in the school?

01:11:05.124 --> 01:11:07.991
It was like
some sort of alternate universe.

01:11:09.428 --> 01:11:11.362
On top of everything else,

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:14.365
I was going to take the driving test,

01:11:14.433 --> 01:11:17.698
so I had to find my most
responsible-looking ensemble.

01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:22.400
Where's my white collarless shirt?

01:11:22.474 --> 01:11:23.907
Lucy, where's my shirt?

01:11:23.976 --> 01:11:25.409
Probably at the cleaner.

01:11:25.477 --> 01:11:27.911
Oh, but today's the driving test.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.414
It's my most capable-looking outfit.

01:11:30.482 --> 01:11:32.382
O.K., I call them.

01:11:32.451 --> 01:11:33.884
Oh, it's too late now.

01:11:33.953 --> 01:11:36.888
Oh, we got another notice
from the fire department,

01:11:36.956 --> 01:11:39.390
saying we have to
clear out the bush.

01:11:39.458 --> 01:11:41.392
You said Jose would do it.

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.394
He your gardener. You tell him.

01:11:43.462 --> 01:11:44.895
Lucy, I don't speak Mexican.

01:11:44.964 --> 01:11:46.397
I not a Mexican!

01:11:46.465 --> 01:11:48.399
Great. What was that all about?

01:11:48.467 --> 01:11:50.401
Lucy's from El Salvador.

01:11:50.469 --> 01:11:51.834
So?

01:11:51.904 --> 01:11:53.735
It's an entirely different country.

01:11:53.806 --> 01:11:55.068
What does that matter?

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:58.109
You get upset if someone
thinks you live below Sunset.

01:11:58.177 --> 01:11:59.735
So everything is all my fault.

01:11:59.812 --> 01:12:01.074
I'm always wrong, right?

01:12:01.146 --> 01:12:02.477
You're such a brat.

01:12:02.548 --> 01:12:04.914
I had an overwhelming sense of ickyness.

01:12:04.984 --> 01:12:06.849
Even though I apologized to Lucy,

01:12:06.919 --> 01:12:08.853
something was still plaguing me.

01:12:11.056 --> 01:12:13.456
Like Josh thinking
I was mean was making me postal.

01:12:13.525 --> 01:12:16.085
Move into the right lane.

01:12:16.161 --> 01:12:18.356
Anyway, why should I care
what Josh thinks?

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:20.762
Why was I letting it throw me
into such turmoil?

01:12:20.833 --> 01:12:22.528
Watch out for the bike rid...

01:12:22.601 --> 01:12:24.034
Oops! My bad.

01:12:24.103 --> 01:12:25.934
What are you doing?

01:12:26.005 --> 01:12:28.439
You can't take up both lanes.

01:12:28.507 --> 01:12:29.701
Get in the right lane.

01:12:29.775 --> 01:12:32.039
Not so...

01:12:32.111 --> 01:12:34.375
Ooh! Should I write them a note?

01:12:34.446 --> 01:12:38.439
Pull over up here
and turn off the engine.

01:12:38.517 --> 01:12:39.882
Right there.

01:12:39.952 --> 01:12:42.113
Oh!

01:12:42.187 --> 01:12:44.314
Are you going to take me somewhere

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:46.688
to make left-hand turns?

01:12:46.759 --> 01:12:48.124
We're going back.

01:12:48.193 --> 01:12:49.182
It's over?

01:12:49.261 --> 01:12:51.126
It's over.

01:12:51.196 --> 01:12:53.687
Well, how did I do?

01:12:53.766 --> 01:12:56.894
How did you do?
Well, let's see, shall we?

01:12:56.969 --> 01:12:59.403
You can't park,
you can't switch lanes,

01:12:59.471 --> 01:13:01.234
you can't make
right-hand turns,

01:13:01.306 --> 01:13:02.568
you've damaged private property,

01:13:02.641 --> 01:13:04.074
and you almost killed someone.

01:13:04.143 --> 01:13:06.373
Offhand, I'd say you failed.

01:13:06.445 --> 01:13:07.844
Failed?

01:13:07.913 --> 01:13:10.347
Well, can't we just start over?

01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:12.850
I mean, I'm kind
of having a personal problem.

01:13:12.918 --> 01:13:14.852
My mind was somewhere else.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.854
That biker came out of nowhere!

01:13:16.922 --> 01:13:18.856
Oh! I swear I'll concentrate!

01:13:18.924 --> 01:13:21.552
I drive really good, usually.

01:13:21.627 --> 01:13:24.892
Isn't there somebody else
I can talk to?

01:13:24.963 --> 01:13:27.363
You can't be
the absolute and final word

01:13:27.433 --> 01:13:29.094
in driver's licenses.

01:13:29.168 --> 01:13:31.602
Girlie, as far
as you're concerned,

01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:34.571
I'm the messiah of the DMV.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.870
Now, get out of the car.

01:13:50.956 --> 01:13:52.890
I can't believe I failed.

01:13:52.958 --> 01:13:56.894
I failed something
I couldn't talk my way out of?

01:14:00.599 --> 01:14:02.396
[Josh]
Go ahead, yeah.

01:14:02.468 --> 01:14:04.402
Put your legs into me.

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:05.835
Hey, you're home.

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:08.771
How does it feel
to have a license?

01:14:08.841 --> 01:14:11.571
I wouldn't know. I failed.

01:14:11.643 --> 01:14:13.804
Oh. Bummer.

01:14:13.879 --> 01:14:15.847
And, Josh, spare me your lectures

01:14:15.914 --> 01:14:17.848
on how driving is
such a big responsibility

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:19.406
and you can't B.S.
your way through it.

01:14:19.485 --> 01:14:21.646
I didn't say anything.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.051
I know what you're thinking.

01:14:30.362 --> 01:14:32.796
I got to tell you something.

01:14:32.865 --> 01:14:34.856
I'm really sorry about your test.

01:14:34.933 --> 01:14:36.867
I am so glad you're here.

01:14:36.935 --> 01:14:38.869
There's something I got to do.

01:14:38.937 --> 01:14:41.371
I need you here. Does this work?

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.374
Yeah. What is this stuff?

01:14:43.442 --> 01:14:44.875
A bunch of junk

01:14:44.943 --> 01:14:46.877
that reminded me of Elton.

01:14:46.945 --> 01:14:50.381
I want to burn it
because I'm so over him.

01:14:50.449 --> 01:14:51.882
What stuff?

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:55.386
Do you remember
when we were at the Val party

01:14:55.454 --> 01:14:57.388
and the clog knocking me out

01:14:57.456 --> 01:14:59.890
and Elton got a towel of ice?

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:02.392
I didn't tell you at the time,

01:15:02.461 --> 01:15:04.895
but I took the towel as a souvenir.

01:15:04.963 --> 01:15:06.328
You're kidding.

01:15:06.398 --> 01:15:07.831
No.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.265
And then...

01:15:09.334 --> 01:15:11.962
remember that song
that was playing when we danced?

01:15:12.037 --> 01:15:13.265
Remember that?

01:15:13.338 --> 01:15:16.205
You know, Rollin' With The Homies.

01:15:16.275 --> 01:15:18.334
Anyways, I got the tape, right?

01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:21.277
I listened to it, like,
every single night.

01:15:21.346 --> 01:15:23.337
Don't burn that, O.K.?

01:15:23.415 --> 01:15:27.181
Tai, I'm really happy for you,

01:15:27.252 --> 01:15:29.846
but what brought on
this surge of empowerment?

01:15:29.922 --> 01:15:32.857
It's, like, I met this guy

01:15:32.925 --> 01:15:34.358
who's so totally amazing

01:15:34.426 --> 01:15:37.190
that he makes Elton
look like a loser.

01:15:37.262 --> 01:15:39.199
That is so great.

01:15:39.332 --> 01:15:42.165
Look, you've got to
help me get Josh.

01:15:42.235 --> 01:15:44.635
Get Josh what?

01:15:44.704 --> 01:15:47.002
You know what I mean?

01:15:47.073 --> 01:15:48.506
I like him.

01:15:48.575 --> 01:15:50.975
Do you think
that he likes you?

01:15:51.044 --> 01:15:51.976
Yeah.

01:15:52.045 --> 01:15:53.478
How do you know?

01:15:53.546 --> 01:15:55.480
Like, little things, you know?

01:15:55.548 --> 01:15:57.880
Like, he always finds
some sort of way

01:15:57.951 --> 01:16:00.215
to touch me or tickle me.

01:16:00.286 --> 01:16:02.880
Do you remember
the time at the frat

01:16:02.956 --> 01:16:04.890
when I was totally depressed?

01:16:04.958 --> 01:16:07.688
We danced, and he was really flirty.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.887
You O.K.?

01:16:09.963 --> 01:16:13.831
Yeah. Oh, actually...
I was really bad today.

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.834
I had two mochaccinos.

01:16:15.902 --> 01:16:17.335
I feel like ralphing.

01:16:17.403 --> 01:16:19.837
I know exactly how that feels.

01:16:19.906 --> 01:16:23.273
Like, the other day,
I was talking to Josh,

01:16:23.343 --> 01:16:25.334
and we were discussing
the difference

01:16:25.411 --> 01:16:27.345
between high school girls
and college girls.

01:16:27.413 --> 01:16:29.847
College girls wear less makeup.

01:16:29.916 --> 01:16:31.907
That's why guys like them more.

01:16:31.985 --> 01:16:35.853
But, Tai, do you really think
you'd be good with Josh?

01:16:35.922 --> 01:16:38.891
I mean, he's, like,
a school nerd.

01:16:38.958 --> 01:16:41.586
Am I some sort of
a mentally challenged airhead?

01:16:41.661 --> 01:16:43.094
No! Not even!

01:16:43.162 --> 01:16:45.562
I didn't say that.

01:16:45.632 --> 01:16:48.032
I'm not good enough
for Josh or something?

01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:54.438
l... I just... don't think
you mesh well together.

01:16:54.507 --> 01:16:57.067
You don't think
that we mesh well?

01:16:57.143 --> 01:17:00.738
Why am I even listening to you
to begin with?

01:17:00.813 --> 01:17:05.375
You're a virgin who can't drive.

01:17:08.388 --> 01:17:11.721
Oh, that was way harsh, Tai.

01:17:11.791 --> 01:17:14.817
All right. Look, I'm really sorry.

01:17:14.894 --> 01:17:17.829
Let's just talk when
we've mellowed, all right?

01:17:17.897 --> 01:17:19.330
I'm Audi.

01:17:22.735 --> 01:17:24.828
What did I do?

01:17:24.904 --> 01:17:27.839
I've created some sort of a monster.

01:17:27.907 --> 01:17:32.844
I could feel the chunks
start to rise up in my throat.

01:17:32.912 --> 01:17:35.278
I had to get out.

01:17:37.183 --> 01:17:40.880
? When I was young?

01:17:40.953 --> 01:17:44.946
? I never needed anyone?

01:17:45.024 --> 01:17:48.460
Everything I think
and everything I do is wrong.

01:17:48.528 --> 01:17:50.462
I was wrong about Elton.

01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:51.861
I was wrong about Christian.

01:17:51.931 --> 01:17:53.523
Now Josh hated me.

01:17:53.599 --> 01:17:57.365
It all boiled down to
one inevitable conclusion...

01:17:57.437 --> 01:17:59.871
I was just totally clueless.

01:17:59.939 --> 01:18:02.874
Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing

01:18:02.942 --> 01:18:04.876
was wiggin' me more than anything.

01:18:04.944 --> 01:18:07.310
What was my problem? Tai is my pal.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.314
I don't begrudge her a boyfriend.

01:18:09.382 --> 01:18:10.815
I really... Ooh!

01:18:10.883 --> 01:18:12.908
I wonder if they have that in my size.

01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:17.315
What does she want with Josh anyway?

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:18.823
He dresses funny.

01:18:18.891 --> 01:18:20.825
He listens to complaint rock.

01:18:20.893 --> 01:18:24.522
He's not even cute...
in a conventional way.

01:18:24.597 --> 01:18:28.795
I mean, he's just like this slug

01:18:28.868 --> 01:18:31.462
who hangs around
the house all the time.

01:18:31.537 --> 01:18:35.132
And he's a hideous dancer.

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:38.075
Couldn't take him anywhere.

01:18:38.144 --> 01:18:41.079
Wait a second.
What am I stressing about?

01:18:41.147 --> 01:18:43.081
This is, like, Josh.

01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:47.176
? All by myself??

01:18:47.253 --> 01:18:50.188
O.K., O.K.,
so he's kind of a Baldwin.

01:18:50.256 --> 01:18:52.690
What would he want with Tai?

01:18:52.759 --> 01:18:54.693
She couldn't make him happy.

01:18:54.761 --> 01:18:56.695
Josh needs someone with imagination,

01:18:56.763 --> 01:18:59.197
someone to take care of him,

01:18:59.265 --> 01:19:01.699
someone to laugh at his jokes...

01:19:01.768 --> 01:19:04.202
in case he ever makes any.

01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:05.794
Then suddenly...

01:19:05.872 --> 01:19:07.965
Oh, my God.

01:19:09.876 --> 01:19:12.936
I love Josh.

01:19:13.012 --> 01:19:17.847
I am majorly, totally,
crazy in love with Josh.

01:19:17.917 --> 01:19:21.318
But now I don't know
how to act around him.

01:19:21.387 --> 01:19:23.821
I mean, ordinarily,
I'd strut around him

01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:25.323
in my cutest little outfits

01:19:25.391 --> 01:19:27.325
and send myself flowers and candy,

01:19:27.393 --> 01:19:30.328
but I couldn't do that stuff with Josh.

01:19:30.396 --> 01:19:31.829
What's with you?

01:19:31.898 --> 01:19:33.331
What do you mean?

01:19:33.399 --> 01:19:34.832
You're so quiet.

01:19:34.901 --> 01:19:37.335
You haven't made me
watch The Real World.

01:19:37.403 --> 01:19:39.337
I care about the news.

01:19:39.405 --> 01:19:40.497
Since when?

01:19:40.573 --> 01:19:42.632
Since now.

01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:44.903
...ln Central Bosnia.

01:19:44.977 --> 01:19:47.844
You look confused.

01:19:47.914 --> 01:19:52.351
Well, uh, I thought they
declared peace in the Middle East.

01:20:02.328 --> 01:20:03.659
Cher, get in here!

01:20:03.729 --> 01:20:05.128
What's up, Daddy?

01:20:05.198 --> 01:20:06.995
What are you doing dancing
in front of my office?

01:20:07.066 --> 01:20:09.500
Nothing. I just wanted to see

01:20:09.569 --> 01:20:11.969
if you need any help with anything.

01:20:12.038 --> 01:20:14.302
Yeah, you can help me
with something.

01:20:14.373 --> 01:20:15.806
Come over here.

01:20:17.376 --> 01:20:19.310
All right.

01:20:19.378 --> 01:20:21.312
Every time that you see

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:22.813
a telephone conversation

01:20:22.882 --> 01:20:27.717
that took place on September 3rd,
highlight it.

01:20:27.787 --> 01:20:29.812
- Just September 3rd.
- O.K.

01:20:32.892 --> 01:20:34.826
It's fun, huh?

01:20:34.894 --> 01:20:36.327
Yeah.

01:20:37.897 --> 01:20:39.626
O.K.

01:20:39.699 --> 01:20:42.327
Daddy, did you ever have a problem

01:20:42.401 --> 01:20:44.494
that you couldn't
argue your way out of?

01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:47.266
Tell me the problem,
and we'll figure out how to argue it.

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:51.299
I like this boy,
and he likes someone else.

01:20:51.377 --> 01:20:53.038
How could that be?

01:20:53.112 --> 01:20:55.342
I don't know. I feel wretched.

01:20:55.414 --> 01:20:57.211
Obviously, this boy
is a complete moron.

01:20:57.283 --> 01:21:01.549
You are the most beautiful girl
in Beverly Hills.

01:21:01.621 --> 01:21:03.851
And to tell you the truth,

01:21:03.923 --> 01:21:07.359
I'm not sure I want you
with a stupid fellow.

01:21:07.426 --> 01:21:09.860
Well, actually, he is a smart guy.

01:21:09.929 --> 01:21:12.363
He's one of those do-gooder types.

01:21:12.431 --> 01:21:15.491
I feel like my after-school
commitments aren't good enough.

01:21:15.568 --> 01:21:17.365
How can you say that?

01:21:17.436 --> 01:21:19.870
Who takes care of everyone
in this household?

01:21:19.939 --> 01:21:22.373
Who makes sure that
Daddy eats right?

01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:26.673
I have not seen
such good-doing since your mother.

01:21:26.746 --> 01:21:27.872
Really?

01:21:27.947 --> 01:21:31.144
Really.

01:21:31.217 --> 01:21:33.310
Now, get back to work.

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:41.385
Later, while we were learning
about the Pismo Beach disaster,

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.395
I decided I needed
a complete makeover,

01:21:44.463 --> 01:21:47.899
except this time,
I'd makeover my soul.

01:21:47.967 --> 01:21:50.401
But what makes somebody
a better person?

01:21:50.469 --> 01:21:54.906
Then I realized all my friends
were good in different ways.

01:21:54.974 --> 01:21:56.908
Like Christian,
he always wants things

01:21:56.976 --> 01:21:58.773
to be beautiful and interesting.

01:21:58.844 --> 01:22:00.277
Or Dionne and Murray,

01:22:00.346 --> 01:22:02.405
when they think no one is watching,

01:22:02.481 --> 01:22:04.244
are so considerate of each other.

01:22:04.317 --> 01:22:06.615
And poor Miss Geist,

01:22:06.686 --> 01:22:08.847
always trying to get us involved

01:22:08.921 --> 01:22:11.116
no matter how much we resist.

01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:12.623
Oh. That's just...

01:22:12.692 --> 01:22:14.353
That doesn't even show...

01:22:14.427 --> 01:22:16.361
Every single possession,
every memory,

01:22:16.429 --> 01:22:18.863
everything you've had
your whole life

01:22:18.931 --> 01:22:20.364
gone in a second.

01:22:20.433 --> 01:22:23.368
Can you imagine
what that must feel like?

01:22:23.436 --> 01:22:24.869
Elton?

01:22:24.937 --> 01:22:26.871
Can I use the pass?

01:22:26.939 --> 01:22:29.874
Yeah. We'll be collecting blankets,
disposable diapers,

01:22:29.942 --> 01:22:32.035
uh, canned goods.

01:22:32.111 --> 01:22:33.373
Miss Geist?

01:22:33.446 --> 01:22:34.879
Cher?

01:22:34.947 --> 01:22:36.608
I want to help.

01:22:36.682 --> 01:22:39.048
That would be wonderful.

01:22:39.118 --> 01:22:40.710
I felt better already.

01:22:43.956 --> 01:22:45.787
Daddy!

01:22:45.858 --> 01:22:47.723
What?

01:22:47.793 --> 01:22:49.454
You didn't like that
red caviar, did you?

01:22:49.528 --> 01:22:51.723
What's she talking about?

01:22:53.132 --> 01:22:54.394
Ew!

01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:06.141
Cher, what are you doing?

01:23:06.212 --> 01:23:10.512
I'm captain of the Pismo Beach
disaster relief.

01:23:10.583 --> 01:23:12.210
I don't think
they need your skis.

01:23:12.284 --> 01:23:14.844
Daddy, some people lost
all their belongings.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.252
Don't you think that includes
athletic equipment?

01:23:17.323 --> 01:23:20.190
This is your influence, Josh?

01:23:26.232 --> 01:23:29.827
? Shake, some action's what I need?

01:23:29.902 --> 01:23:34.305
? To make a bus stop at full speed?

01:23:34.373 --> 01:23:39.367
? And I'm sure that's all you'll need?

01:23:39.445 --> 01:23:41.709
? To make it all right??

01:23:41.781 --> 01:23:43.183
...Really fun.

01:23:45.218 --> 01:23:46.651
It's so pretty.

01:23:46.719 --> 01:23:48.653
Should I leave it here?

01:23:48.721 --> 01:23:51.155
Could you bring it to bedding?

01:23:51.224 --> 01:23:52.555
Thank you very much.

01:23:54.127 --> 01:23:56.891
Oh, Miss Geist,
I need more boxes.

01:23:56.963 --> 01:23:58.396
They're all filled up.

01:23:58.464 --> 01:23:59.556
Already? Great.

01:23:59.632 --> 01:24:02.567
I divided them into
entrees and appetizers.

01:24:02.635 --> 01:24:05.661
Oh. O.K.
I'll have them picked up.

01:24:08.074 --> 01:24:09.439
Uh!

01:24:11.244 --> 01:24:12.370
Hey.

01:24:12.445 --> 01:24:15.380
Proper. This is really decent
of you, Travis.

01:24:15.448 --> 01:24:17.348
Sure.

01:24:17.417 --> 01:24:19.476
I wasn't sure about that.

01:24:19.552 --> 01:24:21.019
I don't need it anymore,

01:24:21.087 --> 01:24:24.523
but far be it for me
to deny anyone else.

01:24:24.591 --> 01:24:26.354
I'm sorry about your shoes.

01:24:26.426 --> 01:24:27.518
What shoes?

01:24:27.594 --> 01:24:29.994
The red ones with the strappy thing.

01:24:30.063 --> 01:24:31.860
Oh, those are so last-season.

01:24:31.931 --> 01:24:33.421
What made you think of them?

01:24:33.499 --> 01:24:34.864
It's one of my steps.

01:24:34.934 --> 01:24:38.893
I joined this club,
and there are these steps.

01:24:38.972 --> 01:24:40.371
There's, like...

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.532
12?

01:24:41.608 --> 01:24:43.041
Yeah. How did you know?

01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:44.041
Wild guess.

01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:45.543
Wow. Good guess.

01:24:45.612 --> 01:24:47.739
Uh, also, here.

01:24:47.814 --> 01:24:49.372
ASL.

01:24:49.449 --> 01:24:51.849
Amateur skateboarding league.

01:24:51.918 --> 01:24:55.376
This clarity thing,
it's brought me to a whole new level.

01:24:55.455 --> 01:24:57.047
My skating...
Would you come Saturday?

01:24:57.123 --> 01:24:58.784
Sure.

01:24:58.858 --> 01:25:00.018
Ah, cool.

01:25:00.093 --> 01:25:01.390
Ha ha!

01:25:01.461 --> 01:25:04.487
Well, um,
I guess kitchenware?

01:25:04.564 --> 01:25:06.327
That's where I used to keep it.

01:25:21.914 --> 01:25:23.347
Hi.

01:25:23.416 --> 01:25:24.849
Hi.

01:25:24.917 --> 01:25:27.351
Cher, can I talk
to you a minute?

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:28.512
Um, sure.

01:25:28.588 --> 01:25:31.352
Look, I have been in agony
for the past week.

01:25:31.424 --> 01:25:34.018
I can't believe
I went off the way I did.

01:25:34.093 --> 01:25:36.584
No. I have been going
down a shame spiral.

01:25:36.663 --> 01:25:38.756
I can't believe
I was so unsupportive

01:25:38.831 --> 01:25:40.355
of your feelings for Josh.

01:25:40.433 --> 01:25:42.628
You're entitled to your opinion.

01:25:42.702 --> 01:25:44.260
I'm the tard here.

01:25:44.337 --> 01:25:47.067
Cher, you've been nothing
but super-duper nice to me.

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.576
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have liked Elton.

01:25:50.643 --> 01:25:52.577
I'm so sorry, Tai.

01:25:52.645 --> 01:25:55.011
I'm really sorry.

01:25:55.081 --> 01:25:58.278
Oh, shit. Now I'm going
to go ahead and cry.

01:25:58.351 --> 01:26:00.478
Let's never fight again, O.K.?

01:26:00.553 --> 01:26:03.545
Next up, number 14,
Travis Birkenstock.

01:26:25.812 --> 01:26:28.042
Woo! All right, Travis!

01:26:31.451 --> 01:26:34.386
I had no idea
he was so motivated.

01:26:34.454 --> 01:26:37.787
Oh, I did.

01:26:37.857 --> 01:26:39.791
When I saw the sparks
between Tai and Travis,

01:26:39.859 --> 01:26:43.295
I knew Josh was
out of the picture.

01:26:52.939 --> 01:26:54.873
You look like Pippi Longstocking.

01:26:54.941 --> 01:26:56.875
You look like Forrest Gump.

01:26:58.277 --> 01:26:59.869
Who's Pippi Longstocking?

01:26:59.946 --> 01:27:02.881
Uh, someone Mel Gibson
never played.

01:27:02.949 --> 01:27:04.940
You're funny.

01:27:14.026 --> 01:27:15.357
What happened to
the August 28th files?

01:27:15.428 --> 01:27:17.328
Hmm? What?

01:27:17.397 --> 01:27:19.228
Mel wanted them tonight.
There were twice as many.

01:27:19.298 --> 01:27:21.323
He's going to go ballistic.

01:27:21.401 --> 01:27:23.164
Where are they?

01:27:23.236 --> 01:27:24.828
I think I checked them

01:27:24.904 --> 01:27:26.394
for the September 3rd
conversations.

01:27:26.472 --> 01:27:28.337
What?

01:27:28.408 --> 01:27:29.841
Where'd you put them?

01:27:29.909 --> 01:27:31.843
I divided them
into two piles.

01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:33.378
I have to redo all that.

01:27:33.446 --> 01:27:34.674
Are you some kind of idiot?

01:27:34.747 --> 01:27:36.339
Hey, she didn't know.

01:27:36.416 --> 01:27:38.350
She just set us back a day.

01:27:38.418 --> 01:27:40.045
Who cares about
the September call?

01:27:40.119 --> 01:27:41.347
I'm sorry.

01:27:41.421 --> 01:27:42.979
Just forget it.

01:27:43.055 --> 01:27:45.489
Just go back to the mall
or something.

01:27:46.926 --> 01:27:48.894
[Josh]
What's your problem, man?

01:27:48.961 --> 01:27:51.122
She didn't mean any harm.

01:27:51.197 --> 01:27:52.630
I'll get killed
'cause she's a moron.

01:27:52.698 --> 01:27:53.687
She's not a moron.

01:27:53.766 --> 01:27:55.358
If you were paying attention,

01:27:55.435 --> 01:27:56.868
it wouldn't have happened.

01:27:56.936 --> 01:27:58.369
If you hadn't have been
playing footsie,

01:27:58.438 --> 01:27:59.962
she wouldn't be bothering me.

01:28:00.039 --> 01:28:02.872
What the hell are you talking about?

01:28:02.942 --> 01:28:05.308
This is a multimillion dollar lawsuit,

01:28:05.378 --> 01:28:07.312
not some excuse for puppy love.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:09.814
We've worked
our butts off on this case!

01:28:09.882 --> 01:28:12.817
Do whatever you want
with your butts.

01:28:12.885 --> 01:28:14.318
I'm calling in sick.

01:28:19.459 --> 01:28:22.087
Did I really ruin
Daddy's lawsuit?

01:28:22.161 --> 01:28:23.822
No.

01:28:26.732 --> 01:28:28.165
Of course not.

01:28:28.234 --> 01:28:30.327
Well, did I set him back?

01:28:30.403 --> 01:28:32.837
I mean, there's
so much work to be done,

01:28:32.905 --> 01:28:35.339
and he can't afford
to lose that time.

01:28:35.408 --> 01:28:37.842
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:40.003
Your father won't lose any time.

01:28:40.079 --> 01:28:43.014
Can you imagine
the nerve of that guy?

01:28:43.082 --> 01:28:46.347
I mean, making
you worry like that.

01:28:46.419 --> 01:28:49.354
He's the one that screwed up.

01:28:49.422 --> 01:28:50.946
Then he goes and blames us.

01:28:51.023 --> 01:28:52.854
Imagine saying we were...

01:28:52.925 --> 01:28:56.486
you know.

01:28:56.562 --> 01:29:00.191
That's right. You've been
very dedicated to this case.

01:29:00.266 --> 01:29:02.359
Yeah. Well, it was
a good learning experience.

01:29:02.435 --> 01:29:05.802
At least for me.
I want to be a lawyer.

01:29:05.872 --> 01:29:09.808
But you, I mean,
you don't need to be doing this.

01:29:09.876 --> 01:29:13.039
Go out and have fun.
Go shopping.

01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:16.815
You think that's all I do?

01:29:16.883 --> 01:29:19.317
I'm just a ditz
with a credit card?

01:29:19.385 --> 01:29:20.352
No, no.

01:29:20.419 --> 01:29:22.819
That's not what I meant.

01:29:22.889 --> 01:29:25.323
It's just... um...

01:29:25.391 --> 01:29:27.621
Uh, th...

01:29:27.693 --> 01:29:30.821
You're... young

01:29:30.897 --> 01:29:34.333
and beautiful and...

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.095
And?

01:29:36.168 --> 01:29:40.867
And, uh, well, what?

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:43.670
You think I'm beautiful?

01:29:43.743 --> 01:29:46.837
Mmm... yeah, a little.

01:29:46.913 --> 01:29:49.848
You know you're gorgeous,
all right?

01:29:49.916 --> 01:29:54.853
And popular and, uh, and...

01:29:54.921 --> 01:29:57.355
but this is not
why I come here.

01:29:57.423 --> 01:30:01.154
This is a good
learning experience for me.

01:30:01.227 --> 01:30:04.390
You already said that.

01:30:04.463 --> 01:30:07.330
Mel. I want to help out Mel.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.891
He's the only one
who cares about me.

01:30:09.969 --> 01:30:12.529
That's not true.

01:30:12.605 --> 01:30:14.402
He's not?

01:30:14.473 --> 01:30:16.998
No.

01:30:17.076 --> 01:30:20.944
Are you saying...
you care about me?

01:30:21.013 --> 01:30:23.311
Josh.

01:30:39.899 --> 01:30:43.102
Well, you can guess
what happened next.

01:30:43.235 --> 01:30:44.827
As if!

01:30:44.903 --> 01:30:46.336
I am only 16.

01:30:46.405 --> 01:30:48.805
This is California, not Kentucky.

01:30:48.874 --> 01:30:50.842
You may kiss the bride.

01:31:12.431 --> 01:31:15.366
I know that
when I have my own wedding,

01:31:15.434 --> 01:31:18.369
I want this, like,
whole, entire floral motif,

01:31:18.437 --> 01:31:19.870
like, very floral garlands.

01:31:19.938 --> 01:31:21.371
No, no, no.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.375
When I get married,
I'll have a sailor dress,

01:31:24.443 --> 01:31:26.377
but it will be a gown.

01:31:26.445 --> 01:31:28.072
My bridesmaids
will wear sailor hats.

01:31:28.147 --> 01:31:30.115
They're planning
our weddings already.

01:31:30.182 --> 01:31:32.116
Could you all stop that

01:31:32.184 --> 01:31:34.880
till death do us part
mumbo jumbo?

01:31:34.953 --> 01:31:36.386
I'm completely buggin'.

01:31:36.455 --> 01:31:37.820
I'm buggin' myself.

01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:39.881
Girls, she's about
to throw the bouquet!

01:31:39.958 --> 01:31:42.358
Come on!

01:31:42.427 --> 01:31:45.885
We got a pool going to see
whose girl gets the bouquet.

01:31:45.964 --> 01:31:47.397
It's up to $200.

01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:48.899
It's in the bag.

01:31:50.502 --> 01:31:52.595
All right, come on, girls.

01:31:52.671 --> 01:31:56.937
Hey! Over here! Over here!

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:11.087
[General Public Singing Tenderness]

01:32:23.135 --> 01:32:27.731
? Seems like without tenderness,
there's something missing?

01:32:32.444 --> 01:32:34.378
? Tenderness?

01:32:34.446 --> 01:32:36.380
- ? Where is the?
- ? Tenderness??

01:32:36.448 --> 01:32:38.417
? Where is it? ...??

01:34:27.925 --> 01:34:32.362
? If I could see?

01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:35.763
? Into your heart?

01:34:37.101 --> 01:34:41.299
? Then would I know?

01:34:41.372 --> 01:34:46.241
? Just where to start?

01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:49.871
? 'Cause I'm lost?

01:34:49.947 --> 01:34:53.075
? And I need to be found?

01:34:54.419 --> 01:34:58.617
? Crazy as it sounds?

01:34:58.689 --> 01:35:01.886
? I need you around?

01:35:03.494 --> 01:35:07.828
? If I could stand?

01:35:07.899 --> 01:35:12.563
? To be on my own?

01:35:12.637 --> 01:35:16.334
? Then I would probably?

01:35:16.407 --> 01:35:21.208
? Just leave you alone?

01:35:21.279 --> 01:35:29.812
? But I'm gonna feel this way
till I'm 6 feet underground?

01:35:29.887 --> 01:35:33.948
? Crazy as it sounds?

01:35:34.025 --> 01:35:37.688
? I need you around?

01:35:41.265 --> 01:35:44.200
? Turning?

01:35:45.603 --> 01:35:48.697
? Tossing and turning?

01:35:50.875 --> 01:35:55.369
? My love is burning me down?

01:35:56.647 --> 01:36:00.777
? If I could change?

01:36:00.852 --> 01:36:05.255
? One thing in this world?

01:36:05.323 --> 01:36:09.657
? I'd change your mind?

01:36:09.727 --> 01:36:14.323
? And make you my girl?

01:36:14.398 --> 01:36:22.931
? Because I'm lost,
and I need to be found?

01:36:23.007 --> 01:36:27.000
? Crazy as it sounds?

01:36:27.078 --> 01:36:31.344
? I need you around?

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:57.905
? I'm gonna feel this way till
I'm 6 feet underground?

01:36:57.975 --> 01:37:02.036
? Crazy as it sounds?

01:37:02.113 --> 01:37:06.351
? I need you around??
