WEBVTT

00:24.649 --> 00:25.900
Ready with the celery?

00:26.651 --> 00:27.527
Ready.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.904
This was a great idea, Rufus.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.699
I think Nina and the kids
are really gonna like it.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.534
A good meal is important after a battle.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.411
Right.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.085
How much longer is he going to stay here?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.379
<i>Not much longer.</i>

00:46.504 --> 00:47.505
<i>Not to break rank,</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:49.591
but you said that two weeks ago.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.384
I need you to hang in there.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.678
You remember the rule, right?

00:54.637 --> 00:56.389
We can't let anyone know he's here.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.529
No breakfast?

01:12.947 --> 01:15.283
We're making a soup
to take over to the Lockes.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.453
Figured it was the least we could do.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.205
Terrible what happened to them.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.999
The kid that showed up,

01:23.416 --> 01:25.376
it was the same kid
that murdered Rendell, right?

01:26.628 --> 01:28.088
Talk about a dog with a bone.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.592
Rufus, will you go down and see if we have
another can of tomatoes, please?

01:39.599 --> 01:41.267
Where were you last night?

01:42.644 --> 01:44.771
Did you somehow have a hand
in this, Lucas?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.857
If anyone had a hand in what happened
at Key House...

01:49.317 --> 01:50.318
it was you, Ellie.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.325
- You take care now, Kinsey.
- Thanks, Mr. Grady.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.496
Another casserole.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.332
Is it weird that when you die...

02:04.833 --> 02:05.708
almost die,

02:06.376 --> 02:07.544
people bring you food?

02:07.669 --> 02:08.545
Totally.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.505
I guess it's nice that people care.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.799
Yeah. I'm sure they're all super stoked

02:12.882 --> 02:14.384
that we lured a psychotic killer

02:14.467 --> 02:15.718
into their nice little town.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.761
Here, let me help.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.228
What are you thinking about?

02:26.020 --> 02:26.980
I don't know.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.066
How messed up this all is?

02:31.526 --> 02:33.111
Dodge is the reason Dad's dead

02:33.236 --> 02:34.362
and she got what she wanted.

02:35.780 --> 02:36.823
She got the Head Key.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.450
Sam said she's gonna use it
to try and open the black door.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.119
Black door?

02:41.202 --> 02:42.537
Yeah, it's in the sea caves.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.209
My friends and I went down there
to film our movie.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.211
I was checking the caves out

02:50.295 --> 02:52.255
and found the door, way in the back.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.715
I know you told me not to.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.800
-So, what's behind it?

02:57.093 --> 02:57.927
I don't know.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.596
-I didn't know how to open it.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.056
That's why Dodge wanted the Head Key.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.684
Somebody has this information
in their brain.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.811
Okay.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.314
Who?

03:09.397 --> 03:10.690
One of Dad's old friends?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.026
I mean we know they used the keys

03:13.109 --> 03:15.028
and they went down to the sea caves
at least once.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.322
-I want to see it.
-I'm not sure

03:17.405 --> 03:18.531
that's a good idea.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.201
We lost track of time down there
and then the ocean came in.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.702
We almost drowned.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.416
Two fifteen is low tide.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.919
You should've come with me
the first time.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.839
Oh, my gosh!

03:35.298 --> 03:36.549
Look at all this stuff.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.718
Yeah. Random people
have been dropping stuff off

03:38.801 --> 03:40.845
-all morning.
-So nice that they care.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.974
Mm! That is pretty good.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.435
And you guys are cleaning!

03:47.518 --> 03:50.104
Thanks so much, guys, for chipping in!

03:51.314 --> 03:53.483
Why don't I go get started on the study?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.074
That was weird, right?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.459
Mom?

04:12.210 --> 04:13.086
Mom?

04:13.169 --> 04:14.254
Mom?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.548
-Sorry.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.175
I thought I could save it,

04:19.300 --> 04:20.426
but it's a goner.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.138
Here, I can help.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.267
It's fine! It's done. See?

04:31.813 --> 04:32.647
Oh.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.524
Oh, honey.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.693
You being back in this room, it...

04:37.443 --> 04:38.444
it must be...

04:39.612 --> 04:41.281
Hey...

04:43.032 --> 04:44.200
what you did to Sam...

04:45.451 --> 04:46.619
you had to.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.622
It was self defense.
You saved our whole family.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.625
I don't want you to ever think
that you didn't do the right thing.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.295
And if you want to talk
about anything that happened,

04:56.421 --> 04:57.547
I'm here for you.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.841
If you don't, that's okay, too.

04:59.924 --> 05:00.800
Do you?

05:01.551 --> 05:02.385
Mom?

05:04.637 --> 05:05.847
Want to talk about it?

05:06.889 --> 05:07.890
Any of it?

05:08.891 --> 05:09.892
I'm okay.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.270
But no emotion is wrong here.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.441
You should feel
however feels right to you, okay?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.192
Okay?

05:19.485 --> 05:20.320
Okay.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.321
Good.

05:24.866 --> 05:25.867
Oh.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.202
I decided to move that old cabinet
in here.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.455
Gives the room a whole different energy.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.957
I might make some more changes
in here, too.

05:34.709 --> 05:35.918
What the hell?

05:39.964 --> 05:41.007
Come on.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.384
What are you doing?

05:43.468 --> 05:44.761
Looking for her stash.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.555
-She's clearly drinking again.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.974
She's acting a little off.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.810
We're all a little off right now.
It doesn't mean she's drinking.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.229
Kinsey, you know the cycle.
First, she gets all happy,

05:55.313 --> 05:58.107
carefree, then she'll get weird
and emotional for a while,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.985
and after that, she'll just... shut down,

06:01.069 --> 06:02.487
won't get out of her bed.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.491
Don't tell me
you don't remember how this goes.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.284
Of course I remember. I'm just saying--

06:08.368 --> 06:09.702
-Spearmint.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.746
I smelled it on her breath.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.164
She reeks of it.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.875
- Shit.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.293
Can't say I'm surprised.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.545
Nothing that's been going on
makes any sense to her.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.130
Is it our fault?

06:24.592 --> 06:25.927
That we've been lying to her,

06:26.552 --> 06:28.513
about the keys, about everything Sam said.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.474
I dunno. I just...
I just wanna find the booze

06:31.557 --> 06:32.975
and throw it out.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.447
What are you guys doing?

06:46.906 --> 06:47.740
Nothing.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.076
-Uh...
-We're just helping Mom.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.161
Yeah, she, um...

06:52.745 --> 06:53.746
she lost her phone, so...

06:54.747 --> 06:56.833
What are we gonna do about Dodge?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.501
She took all our keys.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.837
You know what? Letting us handle it
right now is helpful.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.048
Come on. Let's go downstairs.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.427
I'll make you chocolate chip pancakes.
Hmm?

07:13.933 --> 07:16.060
-Detective.
-I hope I'm not intruding.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.855
-Did you forget something?
-No.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.481
I just wanted to check in on you.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.151
Not in an official capacity,
just as a Matheson neighbor

07:23.818 --> 07:25.069
seeing how you're holding up.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.655
Hope that's okay.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.407
Of course. Come on in.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.204
Sure I can't get you some tea, Detective?

07:35.538 --> 07:36.873
No, thank you.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.499
And please call me Daniel.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.586
How about something to eat?

07:42.170 --> 07:43.463
You'd be helping me out.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.590
Chances are if you name it,

07:46.174 --> 07:48.259
-we've got too much of it.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.177
Right.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.888
The blessing and the curse
of living in a small town.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.599
Everybody knows everything,

07:54.682 --> 07:57.935
and most people
like to show their concern with food.

07:58.019 --> 07:58.895
For sure.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.813
You should see the collection.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.149
Now, if Vincenzo shows up
with his lasagna--

08:03.232 --> 08:04.650
I should call you?

08:05.401 --> 08:08.279
You should consider that lasagna
the bright side

08:08.362 --> 08:10.531
of an otherwise terrible situation.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.417
You know, you could go anywhere.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.837
Maybe getting out of town
would do you guys some good.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.008
My brother-in-law Duncan offered us
his place up in Boston, but...

08:30.718 --> 08:33.554
I think we're better off here.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.974
Getting back to normal.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.478
We're fine.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.534
If you ever want to talk...

08:56.202 --> 08:57.828
I know we don't know each other very well,

08:58.412 --> 09:00.373
but sometimes that helps. I can be--

09:00.456 --> 09:02.583
Thank you, Daniel.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.462
Right.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.509
Well, you've got my number
in case you need anything.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.345
Either police-related or otherwise.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.475
Take care, Nina.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.615
-Are you okay?
-Oh, yeah,

10:57.698 --> 10:58.532
I'm fine.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.951
I'm just moving some things around
in here.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.725
Why are you following me?

11:25.726 --> 11:27.311
It's Jackie. She just texted.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.064
Then why does she need to ring the bell?

11:30.147 --> 11:31.440
-Hi.
-Hey, Kinsey.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.734
-Did you guys carpool?
- No,

11:33.818 --> 11:35.111
actually, we just, um...

11:35.194 --> 11:36.445
We randomly got here

11:36.529 --> 11:37.988
at the exact same time.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.324
-And it gets weirder.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.995
Dueling chowders.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.125
Looks like you're not hurting
for comfort food.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.876
No, this is... this is great.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.922
Oh, my goodness!

11:56.340 --> 11:57.925
The cavalry has arrived.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.051
Hi, I'm Nina.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.429
I'm Jackie. It's so nice to meet you.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.848
I just wish it was another time,

12:03.931 --> 12:05.766
you know, different circumstances.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.102
People come into our lives
exactly when they should.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.980
Or so they say.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.023
-Hi, I'm Gabe.
- Hi, Gabe.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.191
So...

12:14.775 --> 12:17.653
do I have you two to blame for the fact
that I hardly ever see my kids?

12:18.738 --> 12:19.947
-Maybe?

12:21.699 --> 12:22.742
I'm joking!

12:23.117 --> 12:25.745
I'm thrilled
that you guys are forming relationships.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.248
-Mom!
-Oh, I'm not talking about romantic ones.

12:29.331 --> 12:32.710
I mean, my God, I...
I don't even pretend to know,

12:32.793 --> 12:34.962
but friendships, friendships...

12:35.838 --> 12:36.839
are the...

12:37.757 --> 12:40.509
foundation that we stand on.
I really believe that.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.389
I'll just say they're lucky
to have you guys.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.725
Really!

12:48.225 --> 12:50.269
Especially given recent events.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.939
Yeah, well,  we like hanging out
with them, too, so...

12:55.983 --> 12:57.651
Mm! Don't be strangers, okay?

12:58.694 --> 13:01.697
This is as close as we'll get
to attending our own funerals.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.914
Okay, let's go upstairs.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.837
You wanna, um...
You wanna go somewhere and talk?

13:20.132 --> 13:20.966
Hi, Nina.

13:21.675 --> 13:22.510
Hi.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.100
Rufus,

13:30.184 --> 13:32.478
do you want to go and find Bode?

13:32.561 --> 13:34.647
-I think he's upstairs in his room.
-Ten-four, ma'am.

13:42.071 --> 13:42.905
Thanks.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.660
When I heard what happened to you guys,
I just felt sick.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.703
Especially after Joe's memorial.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.747
I am so sorry, Nina. I really am.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.665
Don't be.

13:52.748 --> 13:53.874
You were hurting

13:53.999 --> 13:55.960
and I was interrogating you...

13:56.043 --> 13:58.504
-I should've been more understanding.
-...and for what?

13:59.088 --> 14:00.381
I was just trying...

14:01.674 --> 14:02.842
I don't know.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.387
Have you ever had that experience
in life, where...

14:08.347 --> 14:10.808
it just doesn't make any kind of sense
and...

14:11.851 --> 14:14.270
you're so angry
about why things are the way they are?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.191
Yeah. I have.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.610
You wanna come in?

14:22.361 --> 14:24.071
-Yes.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.742
I want to apologize...

14:30.828 --> 14:32.746
for bailing on the 5k and...

14:34.957 --> 14:36.000
at that party...

14:37.918 --> 14:38.919
I was a dick.

14:40.838 --> 14:41.964
I shouldn't have left.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.384
It really hurt me.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.512
I'm so sorry.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.851
I know.

14:57.938 --> 14:58.939
Don't do it again.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.114
Ellie?

15:07.865 --> 15:09.909
Kinsey.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.453
I'm so glad you guys are all okay.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.370
Thanks.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.416
Is everything okay with you?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.710
-Me?

15:21.128 --> 15:22.713
Sure, why?

15:22.796 --> 15:24.715
You haven't been approached
by anyone strange?

15:26.216 --> 15:27.384
An unusual visitor?

15:29.637 --> 15:30.471
Um--

15:30.554 --> 15:32.473
Like say a very pretty girl

15:32.556 --> 15:34.016
about yea high, dark hair?

15:35.643 --> 15:36.936
No.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.479
Haven't seen anyone like that.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.856
Okay. Good.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.858
Okay.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.612
You have to take, like,
four casseroles with you.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.572
Do you have Vincenzo's lasagna?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.616
Sadly, no.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.743
-I should get back up to Gabe.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.537
Mom! Mom!

15:56.956 --> 15:57.957
Aw...

15:58.165 --> 16:01.377
Did you know
that Rufus has a P51 D Mustang?

16:01.460 --> 16:03.420
-That's a car?
-An aircraft.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.421
A model airplane.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.757
Bode wants to come over
and work on it with me.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.467
Yeah. If it's okay.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.052
Yeah, it sounds like fun.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.846
Well, if that's okay with you, of course.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.100
Might do him some good, you know,
to get out of the house for a bit.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.435
Sure. Of course.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.729
-Thanks, Mom.
-Have fun.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.106
-Thanks, Ellie.
- Sure.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.857
Come on, Rufus!

16:30.739 --> 16:31.573
Hey,

16:31.657 --> 16:33.283
you got into Parsons, that's awesome.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.494
Oh, yeah.  Thanks.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.747
I wasn't snooping by the way.
That was just like sitting there.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.832
It's fine.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.711
Well, you don't seem very excited
about it.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.672
Yeah, I dunno. I used to think I would be.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.174
Should I be?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.927
I'm not going to tell you
how to feel.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.097
-That's very smart of you.
-Mm.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.392
Although, if I was speaking selfishly,

16:58.475 --> 17:00.436
I can't say that I'd be thrilled

17:00.936 --> 17:03.689
at the idea of you being away
the whole summer.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.274
No?

17:07.109 --> 17:09.778
Well, I think you'd be the only one
who'd miss me.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.155
What? That's not true.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.198
-You're the only one who's here, Gabe.

17:13.282 --> 17:17.119
Okay, Doug and Zadie,
they wanted to be here, okay?

17:17.202 --> 17:19.204
And I haven't talked to Scot yet,

17:19.288 --> 17:20.122
but I'm sure--

17:20.205 --> 17:21.540
They're all still mad at me.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.458
I get that.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.084
I deserve it.

17:24.418 --> 17:27.087
No, but I think they're all just
a little freaked out. I mean...

17:27.838 --> 17:29.882
It's kinda crazy
what happened to you and your family.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.717
Yeah, no shit.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.845
When I heard that guy came back...

17:34.928 --> 17:37.306
who does that?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.476
What did he want? Was he after revenge?

17:42.811 --> 17:45.689
What does my family have
that no one else in the world does?

17:45.773 --> 17:47.524
-Like 19 chimneys?

17:47.608 --> 17:48.692
No.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.321
Oh, you mean like magical keys?

17:52.696 --> 17:53.572
Yeah.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.324
But how did he...

17:55.824 --> 17:58.494
I mean,  I thought
that hardly anyone knew about those.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.748
That may be a story for another day.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.416
Okay. Sure, yeah.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.668
Yeah, no rush...

18:11.924 --> 18:14.176
Your secret's safe with me.
I hope you know that.

18:15.135 --> 18:15.969
I do.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.514
-Thank you.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.271
Kinsey!
Someone's at the door for you!

18:28.148 --> 18:29.483
I'll be right back, okay?

18:40.744 --> 18:42.162
Your mum let me in.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.915
She's really quite friendly.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.459
Kept calling me "Scot with one T."

18:48.043 --> 18:50.170
-It was--
-I thought you were pissed at me.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.339
I've been... I was.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.799
Look, I really was.

18:53.882 --> 18:54.716
But, you know,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.969
then what happened
happened and I just...

18:57.553 --> 18:59.179
I mean, that kind of thing is...

18:59.721 --> 19:02.307
it's bloody unbelievable, isn't it?

19:02.558 --> 19:05.310
So it kinda puts everything else
into perspective, and...

19:06.145 --> 19:09.439
yeah, it just...
it seems kinda silly to be mad now.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.234
I'm glad.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.366
Listen, Scot, you should know that I'm--

19:19.449 --> 19:21.702
That you're sorry?
Yeah, I know you're sorry.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.912
Yeah, I am. I'm really sorry,
but also, you know--

19:23.996 --> 19:26.707
Why don't we just
consider that box ticked, yeah?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.209
I only get like 30 minutes on break
from work

19:29.293 --> 19:31.837
and I already spent half of that time
getting my poxy car started

19:31.920 --> 19:33.088
and driving over here, so...

19:33.213 --> 19:35.299
if it's all right with you,
I would like to spend

19:36.049 --> 19:37.301
what little time we have...

19:39.678 --> 19:41.597
giving you this.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.726
Not rocky road?

19:45.809 --> 19:47.436
Yeah, I thought...

19:48.520 --> 19:51.106
maybe just, like, a little bit too soon

19:51.732 --> 19:53.483
even for me.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.530
Hey, Scot.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.159
Hey.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.662
Gabe just came by to,
you know, see how I was.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.122
Right. Yeah.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.248
Yeah, yeah.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.709
-Come in. Hang out with us.
-No, no, no. I shouldn't. I, uh...

20:10.792 --> 20:12.252
I'm due back in a few.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.504
And my car's acting up.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.672
And also I need a--

20:16.340 --> 20:19.259
I need a good few minutes
to get the old apron on nicely.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.679
So, uh, I'll just...

20:23.222 --> 20:24.181
I'll see you soon.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.728
I'm really glad you're okay.

20:30.854 --> 20:33.148
Thanks... for the mint chip.

20:35.150 --> 20:35.984
Right.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.419
I should probably head out, too.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.797
Oh. Okay.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.967
But I'm gonna give him, like,
a minute's head start if that's cool.

21:04.471 --> 21:08.183
This is not easy.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.560
Beats being home.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.438
Is it hard to be there
after what happened?

21:13.522 --> 21:15.524
It's not really that.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.733
It's just...

21:16.817 --> 21:19.820
Tyler and Kinsey have been
keeping secrets from me again.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.822
And it's super frustrating.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.283
How do you know
they're keeping secrets from you?

21:24.533 --> 21:25.909
Wouldn't that be secret?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.661
They think they're protecting me.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.204
But they're wrong.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.499
Just because they're older
doesn't mean they're right.

21:39.923 --> 21:40.966
What's up?

21:41.550 --> 21:44.094
If your direct commander
wanted you to keep...

21:44.594 --> 21:47.347
sensitive intel on an enemy classified,

21:48.140 --> 21:49.016
would you,

21:49.516 --> 21:51.810
under any circumstances,

21:52.311 --> 21:53.395
disobey that order?

21:54.146 --> 21:55.731
Do you have an enemy, too?

21:55.897 --> 21:58.275
Or are we talking about mine?

21:59.651 --> 22:00.485
Rufus.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.072
Who's your little friend?

22:06.616 --> 22:07.617
This is Bode.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.412
Bode, this is...

22:11.538 --> 22:12.414
my cousin.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.167
We're really busy right now.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.293
I can see that.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.135
So, I didn't know that Rufus had a cousin.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.012
Where are you from?

22:27.596 --> 22:28.722
Nowhere in particular.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.099
Move around a lot.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.227
I like living with Ellie, though.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.482
Sorry to hear
about what happened at your house.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.192
Thanks,

22:40.275 --> 22:43.987
but like Rufus said,
we're sort of busy right now.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.822
Hey, guys!

22:46.573 --> 22:48.492
Brought you some fresh cookies...

22:49.826 --> 22:51.912
You said you were going to be out
all afternoon.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.790
-Well, I just got back.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.877
You guys want some ice cream
to go with these?

22:58.960 --> 22:59.795
Yeah!

23:46.675 --> 23:47.509
Mom?

23:49.636 --> 23:50.470
Mom?

23:53.932 --> 23:55.100
What's wrong?

23:57.144 --> 23:57.978
I...

23:58.854 --> 23:59.980
I broke this earlier.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.983
It was in pieces and I put those pieces

24:03.108 --> 24:04.359
in this cabinet and I--

24:05.026 --> 24:06.528
-I...

24:06.903 --> 24:08.113
I locked them in there.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.906
And then when I opened it just now,

24:09.990 --> 24:12.284
my mug...

24:12.409 --> 24:14.202
it was just sitting there!

24:15.495 --> 24:16.872
Fixed! Like new,

24:16.955 --> 24:19.416
like magic or something!

24:19.749 --> 24:21.001
But that's insane.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.454
See?

24:58.705 --> 25:00.248
-Yeah, I do.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.875
It's not just this. The--

25:02.000 --> 25:04.836
This morning,
I looked into the mirror

25:05.629 --> 25:06.671
and I saw...

25:07.756 --> 25:09.132
me, but it wasn't really.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.967
It wasn't a reflection.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.261
She wanted me to join her, to...

25:13.887 --> 25:14.930
to step into the mirror...

25:18.475 --> 25:20.477
Kinsey, I know how this is gonna sound,

25:20.685 --> 25:23.563
but I think I did
step into the mirror once.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.525
I think I got lost in there.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.361
I don't know how, but...

25:31.321 --> 25:32.864
Does this have something to do with Sam?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.991
With those things he was asking you about?

25:35.075 --> 25:36.493
With... with...

25:36.993 --> 25:39.788
these keys?

25:44.918 --> 25:46.878
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.299
I don't think you're crazy, Mom.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.178
This all seems pretty crazy to me.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.430
I think I need to talk to Tyler.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.599
Good. Yes.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.102
Talk to your brother.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.613
<i>♪ ...put your head on my chest ♪</i>

26:17.033 --> 26:19.160
-That old cabinet Bode thought was a dud,

26:19.244 --> 26:20.078
it's not.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.581
It can put things back together.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.457
Mom's the one who figured it out.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.293
She showed me how it works.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.587
She made it fix Sally
right in front of me.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.799
- She's seen magic before.
-Yeah.

26:33.133 --> 26:34.342
But she's retaining it.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.429
She's even remembering it from way back.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.515
She told me she remembered
getting lost in the mirrors.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.872
Definitely not crazy.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.791
- What's different? Why now?

27:07.083 --> 27:08.460
It doesn't make any sense.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.629
She's drinking.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.965
Maybe that's why she can
suddenly remember.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.217
It has to be. Right?

27:18.219 --> 27:20.013
It's the only thing that's changed.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.892
What are we supposed to do?

27:27.145 --> 27:29.397
If she keeps drinking,
she'll keep remembering

27:29.481 --> 27:31.483
and finally be on the same page as us...

27:34.110 --> 27:37.739
We'd be able to tell her the truth
about everything that's been going on.

27:39.866 --> 27:40.992
Same team.

27:42.035 --> 27:42.994
For real this time.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.500
But you know we can't let her.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.878
So we lose her either way.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.175
This really sucks.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.643
It's almost low tide.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.187
We should go.

28:16.444 --> 28:18.154
-Dad's jacket...

28:18.238 --> 28:19.989
Yeah. It's gonna be freezing down there.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.241
What happened to yours?

28:21.866 --> 28:24.244
Uh...  I left it at Javi's party.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.499
All right.

28:29.582 --> 28:30.583
Let's go.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.798
Don't you look gorgeous today?

28:40.427 --> 28:41.594
I almost didn't recognize you.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.598
I'll just see myself
back to the visitors' area.

28:45.682 --> 28:46.850
Actually,

28:47.016 --> 28:49.644
Ms. Erin is with Gustave right now.

28:50.812 --> 28:51.688
Who?

28:52.230 --> 28:55.692
Don't take your eyes off the quarter,
my friends.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.737
Remember when a quarter
used to actually buy you something?

28:58.862 --> 29:01.072
-And who even uses coins anymore?

29:01.156 --> 29:04.492
They just sit around in dishes
and in drawers.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.369
Why not just make them...

29:06.453 --> 29:08.496
-disappear?

29:11.458 --> 29:13.960
Great. Thanks, Randolph.
How about a round of applause

29:14.043 --> 29:15.295
-for Randolph.

29:15.962 --> 29:19.215
Now, I want you to see
what I'm gonna do here, okay?

29:19.299 --> 29:20.675
This is gonna happen quick.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.345
I'm going to bend this spoon
using just my mind.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.640
-Oh my. Look at that.

29:27.724 --> 29:28.725
Randolph...

29:28.850 --> 29:30.894
- Hey, Vossie.

29:30.977 --> 29:33.188
I got you a little something.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.647
Well,

29:35.273 --> 29:37.442
technically, it's a gift for me,

29:37.525 --> 29:40.695
but you get to provide the key component.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.493
- I made a pun.

29:49.454 --> 29:53.249
Here's hoping Rendell shared
all his secrets with you.

29:55.084 --> 29:57.003
Spare me the weird stuff though, okay?

29:58.046 --> 30:00.590
Just show me where he hid my Omega Key.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.062
What is that?

30:14.854 --> 30:15.772
Lighting stand.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.399
How much further?

30:21.611 --> 30:22.445
Kinsey?

30:25.240 --> 30:27.367
I make terrible, reckless decisions.

30:29.828 --> 30:30.829
I'm aware.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.123
Can we keep going?

30:36.334 --> 30:38.253
I almost got the Savinis killed here.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.048
Because I was so obsessed
with following those stupid whispers.

30:42.757 --> 30:45.510
I thought taking out my fear
would make me feel better.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.221
It just made me act without thinking.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.807
-Being fearless didn't even

30:50.890 --> 30:52.225
make a difference when it counted.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.394
What are you talking about?

30:55.144 --> 30:56.187
With Sam.

30:56.646 --> 30:59.649
I should've grabbed his gun in the woods
the second he dropped it.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.609
But I didn't.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.987
Just like back in Seattle,

31:04.070 --> 31:05.905
I should've grabbed that fire poker.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.868
You didn't grab the poker
because you were protecting Bode.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.078
I saw it in your head.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.039
And what happened
when Sam dropped the gun?

31:16.374 --> 31:17.375
I ran.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.002
Yeah. You ran.

31:20.753 --> 31:21.754
With Bode.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.216
You kept him safe both times.

31:30.179 --> 31:32.640
-You'll make it right with your friends.

31:32.849 --> 31:33.808
Come on.

31:52.076 --> 31:52.911
Whoa.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.225
What do you think's behind it?

32:20.438 --> 32:21.773
Do we really want to know?

32:25.318 --> 32:26.152
Kins?

32:33.785 --> 32:35.954
"The keepers of the keys."

32:36.037 --> 32:37.288
What happened down here?

32:39.332 --> 32:44.462
Jeff, Kim, Mark, Lucas, Dad.

32:44.545 --> 32:45.713
They're all dead.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.715
So now there's just two left.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.468
And we know Ellie won't be any help.
I tried earlier.

32:53.346 --> 32:54.973
What about Erin Voss?

32:55.556 --> 32:56.891
She's in a psych ward.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.103
Seriously?

33:00.186 --> 33:02.939
Mom wrote the name of the hospital down.
I saw it in her room.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.819
Do you remember that story
Javi told us about a...

33:08.403 --> 33:09.320
about a woman

33:09.404 --> 33:11.948
who came to Key House
and then went insane?

33:12.490 --> 33:13.700
Turned into a vegetable?

33:15.952 --> 33:17.787
Thought he was just full of shit, but--

33:17.870 --> 33:19.038
Maybe not.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.665
For once.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.751
If that's...

33:23.835 --> 33:25.294
If that's what happened to Erin,

33:25.378 --> 33:28.172
do you think it would make sense for Dodge
to wanna use that key on her?

33:28.256 --> 33:30.049
Erin was Dad's girlfriend,

33:30.133 --> 33:32.635
so he might've told her
where the key to the black door is.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.638
I think we should go see Erin.

33:36.222 --> 33:37.306
Try to warn her.

33:37.765 --> 33:38.766
You go.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.269
I'll stay with Mom.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.943
Aw, look at you guys.

33:51.237 --> 33:52.280
So happy.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.367
-Too bad it couldn't last...

34:02.331 --> 34:03.166
Ready?

34:17.138 --> 34:18.056
Huh.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.475
Good old Matheson Academy.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.019
Where's the other you?

34:26.939 --> 34:28.775
Way to peak in high school.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.717
-<i>To making the impossible possible.</i>

35:36.801 --> 35:38.928
<i>To us, the keepers of the keys.</i>

35:59.949 --> 36:01.742
<i>Where do you want to hide it?</i>

36:13.212 --> 36:14.672
What are you doing here?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.300
Hi, Erin.

36:18.050 --> 36:19.385
So you're not brain dead.

36:21.012 --> 36:21.929
You're stuck in here...

36:23.639 --> 36:26.184
trapped in your own poor little mind.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.854
Don't know how you managed that, but...

36:31.022 --> 36:33.441
now I do know
where you hid the Omega Key.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.864
-Oh. Ms. Erin's a popular one today.

36:39.947 --> 36:41.949
-She has a visitor?

36:42.033 --> 36:42.867
Mm-hmm.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.536
A beautiful young woman. Like yourself.

36:53.419 --> 36:55.463
Let me out!

37:03.888 --> 37:06.182
Let me out! Please!

37:38.923 --> 37:40.967
Ms. Voss? Hi.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.052
I'm Rendell's daughter, Kinsey.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.104
Rendell.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.400
I'm his daughter.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.986
You guys were really close once.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.363
That bracelet you're wearing
in the picture,

38:02.446 --> 38:03.572
I have it now.

38:05.449 --> 38:06.284
Ms. Voss...

38:07.326 --> 38:10.663
we're worried that someone might try
to get inside your head.

38:18.212 --> 38:19.755
I'm sorry.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.132
I'm so sorry I bothered you.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.551
Dodge...

38:27.430 --> 38:28.556
Dodge?

38:29.849 --> 38:31.142
What, is she here?

38:35.271 --> 38:36.105
The picture?

38:46.115 --> 38:49.410
Dodge...

38:50.745 --> 38:51.746
That's Lucas.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.539
Dodge.

38:53.622 --> 38:54.874
Dad's best friend.

38:55.666 --> 38:56.542
Dodge.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.089
Are you saying he's Dodge?

40:41.439 --> 40:42.356
Rendell!

40:47.778 --> 40:48.612
Mom?

40:52.283 --> 40:53.868
-It's me. I was...

40:54.076 --> 40:55.911
I was just taking out the trash.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.747
I thought...

41:03.043 --> 41:06.338
The cabinet...

41:06.839 --> 41:08.299
I thought maybe...

41:10.509 --> 41:12.386
-It's okay.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.721
No!

41:29.653 --> 41:30.529
Mom.

41:32.656 --> 41:33.991
I'll take care of it.

41:47.796 --> 41:49.673
-Mom?

41:50.424 --> 41:51.634
I'm sorry.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.136
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:57.014 --> 41:58.140
I know.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.685
Mom, I know what you tried to do.

42:04.104 --> 42:05.481
And I get why you did it.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.858
I probably would've tried the same thing.

42:09.151 --> 42:10.528
Why didn't it work?

42:13.614 --> 42:15.324
You saw it before. It was...

42:16.200 --> 42:17.076
it was like--

42:17.159 --> 42:17.993
Magic.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.162
Yeah.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.540
It is magic.

42:23.999 --> 42:26.752
We've tried to tell you before,
but you wouldn't remember.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.589
Then tell me.

42:35.261 --> 42:38.973
I thought I could fix it.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.434
Bring him back.

42:44.311 --> 42:45.688
That I could fix us.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.945
I should have protected you.

42:55.072 --> 42:56.824
All of you.

42:59.827 --> 43:02.621
It's my fault Sam came after us.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.916
I moved us here.

43:08.919 --> 43:11.171
Mom, you are not to blame for Sam.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.257
That I can promise you.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.010
And you don't have to fix us.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.139
Look, I know it's hard...

43:22.516 --> 43:24.476
but you can't go back to drinking.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.565
You just can't.

43:34.653 --> 43:35.779
We need you.

43:38.324 --> 43:39.241
Okay?

44:11.065 --> 44:12.232
I visited Erin today.

44:14.943 --> 44:15.861
Took a stroll...

44:17.154 --> 44:18.906
through that troubled head of hers.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.702
I saw where Rendell hid the Omega Key.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.998
He put it inside his own head.

44:29.708 --> 44:31.168
They went in there together.

44:33.128 --> 44:34.213
How sweet is that?

44:38.884 --> 44:42.137
Ty. Erin pointed to a picture of Lucas.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.682
-She called him Dodge.

44:45.474 --> 44:46.725
Is that even possible?/

44:47.351 --> 44:50.020
-Could they be the same person?
