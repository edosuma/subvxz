01:13.365 --> 01:15.325
Whatever the object was,

01:15.409 --> 01:21.415
I wanted to take it apartand understand what was hiding inside.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.376
[teacher] Sewon!

01:25.669 --> 01:29.256
Sewon, can you pleaseexplain to me why you did that?

01:52.321 --> 01:54.031
Sewon, did you do this?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.949
[mother breathes deeply]

02:01.580 --> 02:03.790
It's okay. Wait for me here.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.794
Listen Mrs. Koh, I understandhe might have been curious

02:08.878 --> 02:10.964
about what was insidethe fire extinguisher.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.091
But the problem here is

02:13.175 --> 02:16.720
that while all the other childrenwere screaming and crying all around...

02:16.803 --> 02:18.180
[sighs]

02:18.263 --> 02:21.934
Sewon just kept on playinglike there was nothing wrong at all.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.687
Oh, I'm very sorry.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.357
I'll talk to him about itwhen we get home.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.068
I'm afraid that we're far beyond that now.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.322
He needs professional attention.

02:36.615 --> 02:37.866
I think you know what I mean.

02:38.742 --> 02:42.871
Sewon isn't really able to feel things.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.706
He has no empathy.

I'm sure that you...

03:16.530 --> 03:19.575
Even if you can't really smile or cry,I know that you...

03:21.577 --> 03:23.787
I know that you can feel everything too.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.045
I'm always going to be by your side.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.423
Don't you worry, okay?

03:40.888 --> 03:41.889
Stop that.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.908
Did you solve it all by yourself?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.036
You're so smart! Good!

04:46.745 --> 04:48.747
Can we solve another cube together?

04:49.540 --> 04:51.083
[doctor] You don't want to?

04:51.166 --> 04:53.877
Then how about we play with dice?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.923
His cognitive skills have improvedgreatly over the past two months,

04:58.006 --> 05:01.051
but as far as social skills are concerned,there's been no progress. but as far as social skills are concerned,there's been no progress.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.096
What does that mean exactly?

05:04.596 --> 05:08.308
Daily routines won't be an issue,however having a social life will be hard.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.853
-Oh.-Mmm.

05:11.854 --> 05:15.399
We'll need to see him more oftenand perform an occasional brain scan.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.235
Let's see here...

05:18.318 --> 05:19.903

Hmm... [sighs]

05:25.158 --> 05:28.704
There is a new programthat started at our hospital.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.206
I'll find outif I can secure a spot for you.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.084
This will be very helpful.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.637
[people shouting]

07:29.241 --> 07:31.952
[doctor 1] He saw his mother dieright in front of him,

07:32.035 --> 07:34.830
but he shows no signsof distress or any kind of emotion.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.833
This is an MRI of his brain,and as you can see,

07:37.916 --> 07:41.378
the distance between his hippocampusand amygdala is too far apart.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.130
His memory is excellent,

07:43.213 --> 07:46.508
but he does not displayany emotional reaction to those memories.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.637
[doctor 2] You must be Sewon.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.975
Do you remember what happened?

07:55.434 --> 07:57.019
Can you tell me about the accident?

07:58.020 --> 08:00.022
Short version, or long one? Short version, or long one?

08:01.231 --> 08:04.443
What's the short version,and what's the long version?

08:05.027 --> 08:09.364
The short version is that my momwas standing and got hit by a truck.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.283
What about the long one?

08:12.993 --> 08:18.207
A man in a blue hat,his eyes opened wide, and then a crash.

08:18.916 --> 08:22.753
The windshield of the trucklooked like a spider web.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.798
Seoul 7 KA 1947.

08:26.882 --> 08:29.092
[doctor 2]You remember the license plate number?

08:35.933 --> 08:41.480
White powder and white shardsspread like water over my mom's head.

08:42.481 --> 08:46.985
And then my mom's mouth moved,and then said something...

08:47.069 --> 08:48.946
Your mother spoke?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.073
What did she say?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.452
[echoing] Sewon.

08:56.995 --> 08:57.996
"Sewon."

09:09.550 --> 09:14.555
That child has...an extremely unique brain structure.

09:16.431 --> 09:21.186
Just look at the ratioof his hippocampus to the amygdala.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.940
His hippocampus is twice the sizeof an average child's,

09:25.023 --> 09:27.401
but his amygdala is only a quarter of it.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.238
He has a brain structureworthy of a case study.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.076
I'm very curious to seehow his brain develops.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.912
[Sewon] Mom said thatshe'd always be by my side.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.124
But she left me.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.418
What was she thinking in that moment?

09:45.878 --> 09:49.423
From then on, I've always wantedto know the human mind...

09:51.508 --> 09:55.721
My insatiable curiositygave way to brain research.

09:56.847 --> 10:02.060
Unlocking what was inside the brainsof others became an obsession. Unlocking what was inside the brainsof others became an obsession.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.785
PRESENT DAY

10:19.286 --> 10:21.330
[footsteps approaching]

10:25.417 --> 10:29.505
[announcer] Now, please welcomeDr. Sewon Koh for his presentation.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.638
We all have the desire to understandwhat people are thinking or feeling.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.183
What started as a question,born out of curiosity

10:41.266 --> 10:43.685
has developed intosynchronization of brain waves,

10:43.769 --> 10:45.687
done via quantum entanglement.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.691
But wouldn't that entailaccess to memories?

10:49.775 --> 10:51.777
Or even access to one's thoughts?

10:53.028 --> 10:55.155
It doesn't matterhow complicated the brain is,

10:55.239 --> 10:57.991
since neurons just useelectricity to communicate.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.452
Now we can analyzethe changes of these signals Now we can analyzethe changes of these signals

11:00.536 --> 11:04.998
and probe the depths of consciousnessin ways we've never seen before.

11:06.792 --> 11:10.420
I get the connections with brain waves,but why understand the language?

11:10.504 --> 11:11.755
What benefits are there?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.757
First, let's talk aboutthe medical aspect,

11:13.841 --> 11:15.759
which concerns life and death.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.303
We can help patients with brain disease,

11:18.387 --> 11:22.015
those who cannot communicate,or those who suffer from severe dementia.

11:22.850 --> 11:26.603
We would also be able to extractthe thoughts of a comatose patient,

11:26.687 --> 11:30.190
which could potentially lead toa diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.318
The day may comewhen we will be able to communicate

11:33.402 --> 11:35.821
solely through thoughtsand without language.

11:35.904 --> 11:39.533
So you're saying that you're tryingto hack into the human brain?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.743
That would be correct.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.454
This could have several usesin the medical field.

11:45.163 --> 11:49.001
Though aspects of your researchclearly disregard fundamental issues.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.963
For example,if all of your thoughts are unfiltered,

11:53.046 --> 11:55.632
can you imagine how seriouslydisturbing that would be?

11:57.926 --> 12:02.389
Yes, brain synchronizationmight present human rights dilemmas. Yes, brain synchronizationmight present human rights dilemmas.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.808
And certainly has a risk of being abused.

12:04.892 --> 12:09.688
Meaning, it's critical thatbefore we establish the actual system,

12:09.771 --> 12:14.151
stringent laws and proper protocolsmust be enacted to avoid such matters.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.030
In a few months' time, my pilotexperiment will be proof to you all.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.531
Thank you for your time.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.869
[scattered applause]

12:34.087 --> 12:35.255
[sighs]

12:41.595 --> 12:43.055
[chattering]

12:48.519 --> 12:50.479
Hello, Dr. Sewon Koh.My name is Jiwoo Hong.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.357
I report for Science Magazine.Thank you for your presentation.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.858
Oh, yes. Thank you.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.985
[mutters] So, off the record, of course,

12:57.069 --> 13:00.197
I was wondering if I could ask yousome questions I've been curios about. I was wondering if I could ask yousome questions I've been curios about.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.157
Sure, go right ahead.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.661
Is your research at all drivenby any kind of personal interest?

13:06.328 --> 13:08.580
Are you asking mewhat my personal motives are?

13:08.664 --> 13:09.831
Yes.

13:12.668 --> 13:16.338
Well, it seems only natural to wonderwhat other people are thinking, no?

13:16.421 --> 13:18.799
Our family, friends, wife, or children.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.009
We want to knowwhat's going on in their minds...

13:21.093 --> 13:24.638
A neurologist would be fascinatedwith the subject alone,

13:24.721 --> 13:27.724
without involving any personal motives.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.853
Yes, of course.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.481
You see, as a journalist,I always make sure

13:34.565 --> 13:38.193
to do as much homework as I canon people of interest, such as yourself.

13:39.528 --> 13:43.699
I discovered that your mother was killedin a car accident when you were a boy.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.868
I also learned thingsabout your wife and son.

13:46.535 --> 13:49.830
Could what happened to thembe your personal reasons?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.749
My condolences.Very sorry to hear about that.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.043
I take special interestin what personal motives

13:55.127 --> 13:57.087
drive accomplishments, big or small.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.089
I've even written articles on the topic.

13:59.173 --> 14:00.591
I don't know. I don't know.

14:02.176 --> 14:04.469
Can a civilization exist without ambition?

14:05.512 --> 14:08.348
Please excuse me. Sorry, I'm late.

14:08.432 --> 14:09.600
It's been a pleasure.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.906
[thunder rumbles, rain pattering]

14:44.760 --> 14:48.597
[doctor] Here are the test subjects.They've been anesthetized.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.844
Let's raise the frequency.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.224
Raised by 1.5.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.393
Raise it by three.

Synchronization failed.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.475
Good evening.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.981
Don't you think you need a break?

16:21.064 --> 16:22.441
Why's that?

16:22.524 --> 16:24.526
You're pushing yourself pretty hard.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.872
-Namil, we're going out for drinks.-Oh, yeah?

16:36.955 --> 16:39.249
-Sewon, you wanna to join us for a---[Sewon] I'll pass.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.298
You're too nice. [clicks tongue]

16:47.049 --> 16:48.217
Why even bother?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.719
You can keep trying,

16:50.802 --> 16:53.931
but he won't really care,so there's no point.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.016
Still, we should try to be friendly.

16:56.099 --> 16:59.061
Showing some humanity sure wouldn't hurt.

16:59.144 --> 17:04.023
So what's the point of being humaneto a man who isn't even human? So what's the point of being humaneto a man who isn't even human?

17:04.107 --> 17:04.983
Yeah!

17:05.067 --> 17:06.984
You know, what's really weird,

17:07.069 --> 17:10.656
is how he can showzero emotion after such a loss.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.032
[mutters]Can we be more discreet? We're all family.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.666
Hey, Dr. Koh!

17:22.584 --> 17:24.461
How about a drink?

17:24.545 --> 17:25.963
[Sewon] No, thank you.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.048
Come on...

17:28.674 --> 17:32.386
A man needs to relieve his stresswith a drink on a day like this.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.762
Forget it.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.265
I don't why I even bother.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.393
[swallows, sighs]

17:39.476 --> 17:43.480
Don't you have any friendsto hang with on a rainy day like today?

17:43.564 --> 17:44.773
I don't.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.577
[cat meows]

18:10.299 --> 18:12.509
[thunder rumbles]

18:31.653 --> 18:35.532
[object thumping]

18:37.451 --> 18:40.871
[Sewon] I had a wife and son...

18:48.962 --> 18:50.964
[echoes] Jump, jump! Be careful.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.302
I always knew I couldn't bean typical husband or dad.

18:55.719 --> 18:59.932
But occasionally, I felt likeI was living a normal life.

19:04.353 --> 19:05.687
[cat meows]

19:05.771 --> 19:07.147
But I was mistaken.

19:07.648 --> 19:08.857
What was that?

19:10.025 --> 19:11.026
Mika!

19:14.947 --> 19:17.199
-[Sewon] Get rid of it.-What?

19:19.284 --> 19:20.702
Get rid of the cat.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.330
It makes a mess of everything.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.918
-We need him.-[Mika meows]

19:28.418 --> 19:30.045
We need Mika for Doyoon.

19:35.300 --> 19:39.721
You know that Mikais Doyoon's only friend.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.978
Please, Sewon.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.231
They help with empathy,communication, and social skills.

Doyoon could seriously benefitfrom a program like this.

19:52.985 --> 19:54.528
[Sewon] He doesn't need that.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.822
I was like Doyoon when I was young.

I'm doing just finewith every aspect of my life. I'm doing just finewith every aspect of my life.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.620
I get along with colleagues fine too.

All I want is for my little boyto be a little more ordinary.

Doyoon is dead.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.000
Doyoon is not dead!

20:50.626 --> 20:53.170
He died in the fire.We recovered his body.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.507
You're being unreasonable.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.344
You need to accept reality. You need to accept reality.

21:01.637 --> 21:05.682
Our son is clearly... dead.

I couldn't accept what she was becoming.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.029

24:11.702 --> 24:14.496
[Sewon] The experiment was successfulbecause the mouse died.

24:14.580 --> 24:17.833
There can be memory retrieval only ifthe brain sync subject is deceased.

24:17.916 --> 24:20.544
-I need a clinical trial!-You want a trial?

24:22.296 --> 24:23.922
Yes.

24:24.006 --> 24:25.632
I need a fresh corpse as well.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.428
You know how fast neurons decaywithout proper blood flow.

24:30.137 --> 24:34.183
For brains to sync, I would needa recently deceased human body,

24:34.266 --> 24:36.393
one that died within 36 hours.

24:36.476 --> 24:40.522
Tell me you're not askingfor a human subject, Sewon...

24:40.606 --> 24:43.025
Let's say I manage to get you one...

24:43.817 --> 24:45.527
Then who would be the recipient?

24:46.028 --> 24:46.945
Me.

24:47.029 --> 24:49.156
You think you'll finda better test subject?

24:49.239 --> 24:51.700
First, I'd needa dissertation draft of your results,

24:51.783 --> 24:54.411
but I doubtthe institutional board would approve.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.247
You'd have to collatethe results of the pilot experiment,

24:57.331 --> 24:58.999
which we would need to review.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.418
And we'd need follow-up measures. And we'd need follow-up measures.

25:01.502 --> 25:03.337
Just bring me the results, Sewon.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.506
The experiment means nothingif it's a secret.

25:05.589 --> 25:07.299
But that might take years.

25:09.593 --> 25:10.928
Just for one day.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.721
Find me a body.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.974
[scoffs] You must be crazy.

25:17.684 --> 25:21.146
Go away. And go back to work.

25:29.279 --> 25:33.325
What? It worked because one of them died?

25:33.408 --> 25:35.285
That's why I need a body.

25:35.369 --> 25:36.870
Look, that's great and all,

25:36.954 --> 25:39.623
but you can't go to human trialsjust because it worked with mice.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.959
Which is why we need a corpse.

25:42.042 --> 25:44.545
But you're sayingyou'll be the recipient as well.

25:44.628 --> 25:48.215
[inhales] No way!That could be very dangerous.

25:48.298 --> 25:49.383
It doesn't matter.

25:49.466 --> 25:52.427
If we succeed,we can come up with a protocol

25:52.511 --> 25:54.888
that will be work on someone consciousor in a coma.

25:54.972 --> 25:58.934
[sighs] Look, I mean...How can this work if you rush it?

25:59.017 --> 26:02.187
Just calm down and maybe justtake your time with the experiment. Just calm down and maybe justtake your time with the experiment.

26:06.108 --> 26:08.527
I've asked the clinical team,but they refused.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.113
I need an alternative.

26:12.322 --> 26:14.157
You have access to the morgue, am I right?

26:15.534 --> 26:17.536
Oh... [scoffs]

26:17.619 --> 26:18.745
Oh!

26:18.829 --> 26:21.081
No way! No, I won't!

46:26.161 --> 46:27.579
Uh, yeah...

46:28.288 --> 46:30.582
I just feel like a drink for some reason.
