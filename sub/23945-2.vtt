00:09.843 --> 00:11.803
Too many wires hanging out here...

00:13.555 --> 00:14.973
OK...

00:16.725 --> 00:18.476
This is an article,

00:19.185 --> 00:21.479
a written piece that I wrote.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.900
So I started out by saying,

00:25.984 --> 00:31.531
"I joined the Flint Police Force
nearly 20 years ago...

00:33.199 --> 00:35.952
because I believed
I could make a difference.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.583
<i>Police officers are problem solvers,</i>

00:42.333 --> 00:46.337
<i>but sometimes it seems</i>
<i>as if the problems have no end.</i>

00:49.174 --> 00:51.885
How can a city fall so far

00:51.968 --> 00:56.389
that we lose sight
of the possibility of solutions?

00:58.683 --> 01:01.102
<i>In one of America's</i>
<i>most dangerous cities,</i>

01:01.811 --> 01:06.357
<i>the people who secure the city are</i>
<i>less secure than they've ever been.</i>

01:09.235 --> 01:10.779
Yet we continue serving...

01:12.363 --> 01:15.742
as we did
through the loss of General Motors,

01:17.035 --> 01:19.871
through the crack cocaine epidemic,

01:19.954 --> 01:26.419
and most recently, through
the mass lead poisoning of Flint citizens.

01:29.672 --> 01:35.428
Protecting and serving an urban community
is about much more than crime fighting.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.518
In the end,
the burden placed on urban police

01:41.601 --> 01:44.312
is that they have the power

01:44.896 --> 01:49.526
to either tear a city apart
or help hold it together."

There's not a lot of money to go around,
not to mention the personnel shortages.

03:02.932 --> 03:07.812
[Tim] <i>I probably shouldn't say this,</i>
<i>but I am not here to kiss ass,</i>

03:07.896 --> 03:10.064

03:10.148 --> 03:12.025
<i>This job isn't that kind of job.</i>

03:13.568 --> 03:17.155
<i>I've always said I'm not a politician.</i>
<i>I'm a crime fighter.</i>

03:17.238 --> 03:21.117
<i>I can fight crime all day long</i>
<i>and go home with a smile on my face.</i>

03:22.869 --> 03:26.456
I've been in this city for 30 years.
The majority of the citizens know me.

03:27.624 --> 03:31.544
<i>Even though I might have arrested them</i>
<i>or sent their family members to prison,</i>

03:31.628 --> 03:34.130
<i>believe me, I did it</i>
<i>with nothing but respect,</i>

03:34.213 --> 03:36.466
<i>and I think the citizens understood that.</i>

03:38.635 --> 03:41.554
I've seen that paperwork on the Humvee.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.890
When is it supposed to be getting in?

03:43.973 --> 03:47.227
[man] <i>It sounded like sooner rather than</i>
<i>later, we would get that thing.</i>

03:47.977 --> 03:49.854
<i>That's the one we'll have to borrow...</i>

03:49.938 --> 03:53.066
<i>Your brother, I think you said,</i>
<i>had a trailer we could go get it.</i> Either that we'll have it
brought back, man. Either, or.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.197
[man] <i>OK. Yeah.</i>
<i>I'll line all that up either way, then.</i>

03:59.697 --> 04:01.950
[Tim] Alright, let's see what happens.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.370
<i>For a police department of this size,</i>

04:05.453 --> 04:08.456
<i>the most challenging part</i>
<i>is working with nothing,</i>

04:08.539 --> 04:10.625
<i>and making something happen.</i>

04:13.253 --> 04:17.548
<i>But we need officers across the board,</i>
<i>with the calls of service that we have.</i>

04:17.632 --> 04:19.259
<i>We need more bodies.</i>

04:20.718 --> 04:25.014
<i>At least we're gonna hire,</i>
<i>I think it's four full-time positions,</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:27.642
<i>we can bring in right now</i>
<i>through the police academy.</i>

04:29.310 --> 04:31.813
<i>I'm really trying to pull</i>
<i>from the city of Flint.</i>

04:31.896 --> 04:34.065
<i>Right now</i>
<i>with the crisis that we're having,</i>

04:34.148 --> 04:37.277
<i>it's easier to pull from within</i>
<i>and to get them up to speed</i>

04:37.360 --> 04:39.904
<i>than it would be to pull</i>
<i>from outside the city.</i>

Keep it up, Reed, let's go.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.457
There you go, keep it up.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.625
[Dion] <i>And I was the only one</i>
<i>that had a plan.</i> -[man] There you go.
-[sergeant] Excellent pace.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.796
[Dion] <i>When I finished school,</i>

05:38.880 --> 05:41.883
<i>I was going to go to college</i>
<i>and become a police officer.</i>

05:43.301 --> 05:45.470
<i>The teacher didn't believe me.</i>

05:47.513 --> 05:51.225
<i>She told my mom that by 18</i>
<i>I would either be dead or in jail.</i>

05:52.977 --> 05:53.978
[man] Time.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.563
[applause]

05:59.525 --> 06:02.570
[Dion] <i>When I applied for Flint,</i>
<i>I didn't think I was gonna get the job</i>

06:02.653 --> 06:04.572

06:04.655 --> 06:05.782
[man] Keep it up, Reed.

06:05.865 --> 06:10.578
[Dion] <i>She said, "I got the call."</i>
<i>I was like, "No way, I got the call, too."</i>

06:16.584 --> 06:18.294
<i>When you join a police department,</i>

06:18.377 --> 06:21.422
<i>you've got to build trust, to know</i>
<i>that people will have your back.</i>

06:22.715 --> 06:24.675
<i>No doubt, she's gonna have my back.</i>

06:25.176 --> 06:28.096
You have to be fully committed
with these techniques.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.265
If you go in somewhat half-assed,

06:31.766 --> 06:33.726
those are the results you'll get back.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.897
Here, here, and out, before he can react.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.361
[Maria] <i>He's always been</i>
<i>my little sidekick, my little rock.</i>

06:43.444 --> 06:46.364
You know, so he depends on me,
I depend on him.

06:48.741 --> 06:53.371
<i>So to have him with me,</i>
<i>it feels like it's meant to be that way.</i>

06:54.539 --> 06:55.832
[Dion] Elbow, though.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.251
-[Maria] Elbow?
-Yeah, not in real life, though.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.212
[Dion] <i>I feel like my mom</i>
<i>could be a little too nice.</i>

07:01.295 --> 07:05.424
<i>But I think she'll do alright.</i>
<i>She has that little mean side to her.</i>

07:07.135 --> 07:09.345
Everybody thinks that
if someone jumps on my mom,

07:09.428 --> 07:12.723
I'm gonna feel some type of way
because she's my mom.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.561
But I feel like I'm gonna bump heads
with my mom more than anybody else.

07:16.644 --> 07:20.523
[all shout] Five, 16.
Serve, protect, encourage!

07:28.614 --> 07:32.994

07:37.039 --> 07:39.167
-Only you haven't got time to play.
-I know.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.674
-These are pretty good seats.
-Yeah.

07:51.387 --> 07:55.933
I met him after, you know, I had been
on the Department for a few months,

07:56.017 --> 07:59.854
and there was, like, a couple weeks
where he had to train me.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.648
I know that's not what you guys would...

08:04.859 --> 08:08.321
He trained me a little bit,
and then we were partners for a while.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.492
<i>I mean, we were co-workers!</i>

08:14.327 --> 08:16.871
<i>I thought he was kind of intimidating.</i>

08:16.954 --> 08:19.165
I mean, you know, he is kind of rough.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.460
He spouts off at the mouth
and comes across as an asshole.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.796
<i>But I liked him from the beginning. I did.</i>

08:26.756 --> 08:28.466
I got a picture she sent me,

08:28.966 --> 08:33.386
and it was some event somewhere, and...

08:33.471 --> 08:36.182
He said something like,
"It looks like a lot of fun."

08:36.265 --> 08:39.393
And I think I told him,
"I wish you had been there with me."

08:39.852 --> 08:41.479
And I was like, "Wait, what?"

08:43.231 --> 08:44.482
Yeah.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.901
[Robert] <i>From that day</i>
<i>until right this very moment,</i>

08:46.984 --> 08:50.821
<i>I have no idea how I am pulling this off.</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:52.740
<i>No idea.</i>

08:52.823 --> 08:55.868
<i>Her caliber of person is far beyond me,</i>

08:55.952 --> 08:59.747
<i>but for whatever reason, it's working,</i>
<i>so I keep trying.</i>

[tense music playing]

09:44.166 --> 09:47.128
[Bridgette] The call was that they were
coming in with sledgehammers.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.678
[Bridgette] I'm stuck.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.181
-[man] You got it? You got it?
-[Bridgette] Yeah, I just...

09:59.265 --> 10:00.308
[man] Ready?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.476
[Bridgette] Shit.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.522
I just don't want to fucking cut myself.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.983
[man] Go through the fence.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.204
[Bridgette] How did these fuckers
get out of here so quickly?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.668
[Bridgette] Does it feel wet?

10:28.294 --> 10:31.172
[officer] I mean, this feels damp up here.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.841
[Bridgette] Let me see if it's smelly.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.260
Yeah, it smells like cigarettes.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.513
[Brigitte chuckles]

10:40.389 --> 10:42.850
[Bridgette] It's got that warm smell
of a person.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.853
That would be awesome
if they left their hat!

10:50.274 --> 10:51.442
Hey.

10:51.525 --> 10:54.862
Some anonymous caller was saying
there was males behind the building

10:54.945 --> 10:57.573
with a sledgehammer,
trying to break into a safe.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.242
[Robert] <i>Was that the one</i>
<i>over by the machine shop?</i>

11:00.326 --> 11:02.703
Yeah. Wait until you see
the damage they did.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.789
They ripped the whole safe up.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.666
[Robert] <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

11:07.041 --> 11:08.626

People say, "You need more time on you.
Spend a few more years on the road."

11:36.153 --> 11:37.196
I don't know if I want to.

I don't know where I'll go

12:09.645 --> 12:13.149

you get great work experience being here.

We don't know what's gonna happen, so...

29:29.267 --> 29:31.853
<i>It made the news the next day,</i>
<i>morning and night.</i> <i>That was it. And that was local news.</i>

29:36.816 --> 29:39.986
<i>Today, I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to worry about getting sued.</i> <i>I'm gonna be on every social media</i>
<i>that's out there.</i>

29:44.240 --> 29:48.495
<i>It's nerve-racking because you're supposed</i>
<i>to go back to work and do your job,</i>

29:48.578 --> 29:51.498
<i>but the entire time you're doing your job</i>
<i>you're wondering,</i>

29:51.581 --> 29:55.001
<i>is the politics gonna sway</i>
<i>one way or another,</i>

29:55.084 --> 29:57.545
<i>and end up costing you</i>
<i>either your job or your freedom?</i>

30:13.061 --> 30:14.521
[Tim] There he is.

30:15.897 --> 30:20.610
Damn, and they talk about me with guns!
How many guns have you got on you, man?

30:21.486 --> 30:23.822
Shit, and they talk
about me carrying guns!

30:23.905 --> 30:26.449
I'm telling you, how many guns
you got on you, man?

30:26.533 --> 30:28.493
He might have four!

30:31.120 --> 30:33.456
-It's all you, brother.
-Alright, here we go.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.335
Highway Patrol Operations.

30:37.418 --> 30:40.380
Captain Bernritter,
if you're not too busy on Facebook...

30:40.463 --> 30:43.007
Patrol division is working through...

30:43.091 --> 30:45.552
The only concerns, really,
that we have right now

30:45.635 --> 30:48.638
is the number of cruisers
that we have, or do not have.

30:48.721 --> 30:50.306
Simply because...

30:52.016 --> 30:54.769
we're having trouble
getting butts in seats

30:54.853 --> 30:57.564
and having to struggle with some cars.

30:57.981 --> 31:02.360
We're still getting quite a bit
of pushback on the computer installation.

31:02.443 --> 31:05.864
I guess, would we be able
just to snatch the cars

31:05.947 --> 31:08.658
and give them back to them
when the crap come in?

31:08.741 --> 31:10.451
[Devon] They don't even have radios.

31:10.535 --> 31:15.331
I know, but... I'm just thinking
of a way to get some cars in here.

31:15.415 --> 31:19.210
I know we want them outfitted
but this is gonna take three months.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.337
It don't sound like we have three months.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.048
They're our cars,
so I would just put them out there

31:24.132 --> 31:27.385
and we use our side radios,
and we roll with what we got.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.223
[officer] For Night Squad for February,

31:32.557 --> 31:35.351
Night A ran 938 radio calls.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.438
The officers have been
working really hard.

31:38.521 --> 31:42.442
[Tim] <i>I'm on every department</i>
<i>during our department head meetings.</i>

31:42.525 --> 31:46.404
<i>"What does your department need?</i>
<i>Where are you at with this, with that?</i>

31:46.487 --> 31:49.073
You need to restructure
in your own department,

31:49.157 --> 31:51.576
make sure officers
are doing this and that,

31:51.659 --> 31:53.912
move people out, move new people in.

31:53.995 --> 31:57.790
If you've got officers not functioning
at their best, send them out,

31:57.874 --> 32:00.335
send them back to patrol,
put three more in there."

32:00.418 --> 32:04.047
That's gonna get the results that we need.
And that's what's been happening.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.341
So, it's restructure,
restructure, restructure.

32:06.674 --> 32:09.218
The changes are coming.
It's a lot on the table.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.138
Please don't think
we're sitting around doing nothing

32:12.221 --> 32:15.391
because you see us walking around here
with a smile on our faces!

32:15.475 --> 32:19.646
I'm smiling because it's getting done.
That's the honest to God truth.

32:20.313 --> 32:23.358
I appreciate you guys.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.109
[officer] Have a good night, Chief.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.535
[officer] So, tonight we got Grohowski
to be canine,

32:34.619 --> 32:38.414
Balasko at 222,
and Cramer at the hospital.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.792
And in case you're not aware,

32:40.875 --> 32:44.253
Chief Johnson ordered me
to rescind all transfers.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.923
So Balasko, I'm giving you a heads up,

32:47.006 --> 32:50.677
because I know that you were supposed
to go up to Detective Bureau on Sunday.

32:55.765 --> 32:59.227
Bridgette, tell me something good.
Tell me something good.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.187
I don't have anything tonight.

33:01.270 --> 33:03.940
-Another day? You got nothing?
-[Brigitte] No.

33:16.452 --> 33:18.371
[officer] <i>Sorry for the bad news.</i>

33:18.454 --> 33:23.376
<i>But with him coming in, he's gonna want</i>
<i>to see where the department's at</i>

33:23.459 --> 33:25.253
<i>and make his own decisions,</i>

33:25.336 --> 33:28.297
<i>and he has a right to do that,</i>
<i>now that he's the new chief.</i>

33:33.386 --> 33:35.013
[Bridgette] <i>It feels really shitty.</i>

33:37.181 --> 33:39.058
I feel lost right now.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.062
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.985
You know...

33:49.068 --> 33:52.405
I made a lot of decisions in my life
based around this job

33:52.488 --> 33:53.531
and...

33:55.867 --> 33:59.370
so of course it's personal to me,
you know?

33:59.787 --> 34:01.414
And I keep telling myself,

34:01.497 --> 34:06.210
I shouldn't let my happiness ride
on a stupid detective spot here.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.170
It shouldn't mean that much to me.

34:09.839 --> 34:12.967
But it does, because
I really wanted to do it.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.763
I was, like, that close.
I had just got two more days.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.681
Monday, it would have happened.

34:21.391 --> 34:24.353
And I'm just completely...

34:30.275 --> 34:33.321
disappointed about
how it worked out, you know?

34:40.661 --> 34:42.538
Oh, gosh.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.967
[coffee maker boiling]

34:56.886 --> 34:58.262
[Robert] The truck's out there.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.311
[Bridgette] That's nice.

35:12.568 --> 35:13.736
[Robert] Give me a smooch.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.493
Be careful tonight.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.538
-[Brigitte] Love you.
-[Robert] Love you.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.790
-[Brigitte] Take care.
-[Robert] Oh, yeah.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.708
I'm gonna go back to bed.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.927
[Robert] <i>She's devastated.</i>

35:38.803 --> 35:41.097
<i>It just doesn't seem fair, you know?</i>

35:42.098 --> 35:44.225
<i>It's something she's always wanted to do.</i>

35:44.308 --> 35:46.978
<i>It's the type of police work</i>
<i>that she wants to do.</i>

35:47.728 --> 35:49.647
<i>She's put a lot of work into this place.</i>

35:49.730 --> 35:53.109
<i>She's really thrown herself</i>
<i>into this department.</i>

35:53.860 --> 35:59.615
<i>Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how much</i>
<i>of yourself you sacrifice for this place.</i>

36:01.075 --> 36:04.287
<i>When it comes down to it,</i>
<i>the bean counters go by seniority.</i>

36:23.431 --> 36:26.893
[tense music playing]

36:37.570 --> 36:40.865
[officer] Hands! Hands!
Put your hands up now!

36:40.948 --> 36:42.158
Get down on the ground!

36:42.241 --> 36:45.745
[yelling]

36:56.631 --> 36:58.216
[man] Fuck...

37:00.426 --> 37:01.761
[Dion] Look, look. [paintball splats]

37:06.807 --> 37:09.268
-[cadet] Fuck.
-[Dion] Did you get shot?

37:09.352 --> 37:11.520
[crash]

37:18.152 --> 37:19.946
[whistle blows]

37:24.617 --> 37:27.245
[instructor] Dion, were you taken out
by the shooter up here?

37:27.328 --> 37:28.329
[Dion] Yes.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.915
[instructor] So, you just stopped?

37:31.791 --> 37:34.293
[Dion] I thought it was,
if you get hit you're done.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.213
[instructor] Yeah, we covered this.
We talked through it.

37:39.173 --> 37:40.925
[Dion] Then I'd continue to fire back.

37:41.008 --> 37:45.680
I thought it was like, you know, one shot.
Pretty much like paintball...

37:46.305 --> 37:48.557
[instructor] You guys have been
getting shot all day.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.393
[Dion] It's the first time I've been shot.

37:50.643 --> 37:53.604
[instructor] You get shot,
it doesn't mean that it's over.

37:53.688 --> 37:56.232
-[Dion] Alright.
-Don't even get that mindset.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.608
What did I say in the gym?

37:57.692 --> 38:00.611
Even if it's a mortal wound,
you still have a couple minutes.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.822
-Right.
-[instructor] Fight through it.

38:02.905 --> 38:04.407
You don't just give up.

38:04.490 --> 38:05.658
When you gave up,

38:06.742 --> 38:09.662
that exposed him 100%, front and rear.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.916
-Where did you get hit? Right on the arm?
-[Dion] On my arm.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.585
Playing paintball,
you get hit, you're done.

38:16.669 --> 38:19.297
-This is not playing. This is reality.
-I know this.

38:19.380 --> 38:22.383
-This is reality. It's not paintball.
-Yes.

38:24.176 --> 38:26.262
-[instructor] And that's just a wound.
-Yeah.

38:27.013 --> 38:30.683
-[cadet] Not the shooting hand.
-Fight through it.

38:30.766 --> 38:34.270
-And if it were the shooting hand...
-Switch hands. Alright.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.480
-[instructor] Switch it over. OK?
-Yeah.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.607
-[instructor] Dion?
-[Dion] Yes?

38:38.691 --> 38:41.652
[instructor] This isn't paintball.
We make mistakes, people die.

38:43.070 --> 38:47.158
[indistinct chatter]

39:01.547 --> 39:05.885
[ambient music playing]

39:15.895 --> 39:18.230
[woman] You want to pull
this hat off his head?

39:19.148 --> 39:21.525
Wait, wait. Yeah.

39:22.651 --> 39:24.111
That's a hole.

39:26.238 --> 39:28.115
[man] Straight assassination.

39:29.075 --> 39:32.953
[officer] He's got a freaking
platinum Visa card in his name.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.956
This isn't somebody
that's out walking around.

39:39.585 --> 39:41.045
That's odd.

39:51.347 --> 39:54.141
[Tim] <i>Seems like there's always been</i>
<i>a black cloud over the city.</i>

39:57.019 --> 39:59.230
<i>The citizens deserve better.</i>

39:59.313 --> 40:02.024
They've been beat down long enough,

40:02.108 --> 40:05.277
and I can give them back
what they're rightfully due.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.117
<i>To be able to walk around this city</i>
<i>and feel safe,</i>

40:11.200 --> 40:14.703
<i>to feel like they don't have to worry</i>
<i>about being robbed or beaten.</i>

40:15.579 --> 40:16.997
<i>That's got to stop.</i>

40:24.213 --> 40:25.506
[Tim] <i>You have to be proactive.</i>

40:25.589 --> 40:28.759
<i>It's about the protection of this city</i>
<i>and the reduction in crime.</i>

40:31.095 --> 40:32.930
<i>You've got to go out and get dirty.</i>

40:35.224 --> 40:38.227
<i>Flint will see</i>
<i>a totally different police department</i>

40:38.310 --> 40:40.187
<i>from what they're used to dealing with.</i>

40:41.439 --> 40:43.107
<i>We'll go in with zero tolerance.</i>

40:45.234 --> 40:48.654
I don't care what hole they crawled into,
what house they crawled up under,

40:48.737 --> 40:50.114
we're gonna bring them out.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.826
<i>We're gonna enforce every law on the book.</i>

40:53.909 --> 40:58.080
<i>I don't care if your pants is halfway</i>
<i>off your behind. That's indecent exposure.</i>

40:58.164 --> 41:00.249
We're gonna arrest for it. Bottom line.

41:02.877 --> 41:06.964
<i>I need ten of the best officers,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna put them in this unit.</i>

41:07.339 --> 41:11.218
It's called the CATT Squad, and they're
assigned to target the high crime areas.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.888
<i>It's like a military operation.</i>

41:13.971 --> 41:16.307
This is my city. This is my city.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.311
We're gonna take our city back.
