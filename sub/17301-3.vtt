19:02.592 --> 00:07.922
This week the off-road Porsche
Cayenne went on sale in Britain.

00:07.922 --> 00:12.762
It's the most
eagerly-awaited new car of the year.

00:12.762 --> 00:15.442
So have we tested it? No.

00:15.442 --> 00:20.002
That's exactly
what they were expecting us to do.

00:20.002 --> 00:23.672
Instead
we've tested its sister car.

00:23.672 --> 00:26.288
This - the Volkswagen Touareg.

00:30.322 --> 00:35.123
Most big off-road cars
aren't designed to do this.

00:39.602 --> 00:43.362
The Porsche Cayenne
is a road-going 911 on stilts.

00:43.362 --> 00:46.482
A sort of Swiss Family Rocketship!

00:46.482 --> 00:51.693
Then there is the ultimate
urban animal. BMW's Fireball XL5.

00:55.602 --> 00:59.812
The Touareg has locking
differentials and skid plates,

00:59.812 --> 01:04.852
and a low-range gearbox so it keeps
rolling when things get military.

01:16.202 --> 01:21.232
Have a look at the tyres. They may
look like they belong on a motorway

01:21.232 --> 01:24.222
but the wheels have been stiffened

01:24.222 --> 01:28.822
to take whatever punishment
is thrown at them.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.905
Onwards.

01:44.701 --> 01:48.431
The best thing about
the Touareg is its engine.

01:48.431 --> 01:53.861
You can have a 3.2L V6 or a 4.2L V8
and I'm sure they're jolly lovely.

01:53.861 --> 01:56.853
I've gone for the diesel.

01:59.961 --> 02:05.381
This isn't the onset of madness.
I haven't come over Bill Oddie-ish!

02:05.381 --> 02:09.550
This is no ordinary diesel engine.

02:09.550 --> 02:12.668
It's huge.

02:13.941 --> 02:18.151
A turbo-charged 5L V10.

02:18.151 --> 02:21.291
That's fantastic!

02:27.541 --> 02:31.391
The figures it produces
are no less vast.

02:31.391 --> 02:36.738
It churns out
553 pounds-feet of torque.

02:38.471 --> 02:44.751
If the world stops spinning
and they need a car to get
it started again - this is it!

02:47.391 --> 02:54.291
If you run a business specialising
in removing enormous trees
from inaccessible forests,

02:54.291 --> 02:57.281
plainly the V10 Touareg is ideal.

02:57.281 --> 03:00.231
But what if you're an accountant?

03:00.231 --> 03:03.121
Or a heating engineer? Or a surgeon?

03:03.121 --> 03:06.331
Or you want
something for the school run.

03:06.331 --> 03:09.038
Well, let's find out.

03:13.631 --> 03:17.131
It's quite fast - 140 miles an hour.

03:17.131 --> 03:20.071
But there are some drawbacks.

03:20.071 --> 03:24.132
The engine is a
third of a ton heavier than the V6.

03:26.891 --> 03:30.651
That means no more
than 19 miles to the gallon.

03:30.651 --> 03:35.657
Because you have a foundry under the
bonnet, the handling isn't much cop.

03:37.271 --> 03:41.391
It's like
driving around on four flat tyres.

03:41.391 --> 03:45.942
You keep adjusting the wheel
just to go in a straight line.

03:55.351 --> 04:00.368
That's like sitting on a machine
separating small rocks from large.

04:03.231 --> 04:07.021
So you go OK -
I'll put it into comfort mode.

04:07.021 --> 04:12.531
Then it rolls so much your children
will vomit explosively and copiously

04:12.531 --> 04:15.081
down your shirt.

04:15.081 --> 04:19.351
I took a Touareg to EuroDisney
with the children recently.

04:19.351 --> 04:23.371
I'd the choice of teeth out,
or carrots down the shirt.

04:23.371 --> 04:27.637
I went for the vomit. That's
how bad the sports suspension is.

04:34.371 --> 04:37.091
There were a few other problems too.

04:37.091 --> 04:41.351
The luggage cover rattled,
the oil light kept coming on.

04:41.351 --> 04:45.011
The stereo sounded
like a 19th century gramophone.

04:45.011 --> 04:49.241
And this is the view
from the rear view mirror.

04:49.241 --> 04:52.151
I could go on.

04:52.151 --> 04:59.691
So I shall. The gearbox works in
geological time. The styling is
iffy. The seat gave me backache.

04:59.691 --> 05:02.541
The phone holder is an afterthought.

05:02.541 --> 05:07.511
"Have we thought of everything?
Agh! The phone! " It's there.

05:07.511 --> 05:10.901
My phone fits - but it doesn't work.

05:10.901 --> 05:14.511
The price is £50,000.

05:14.511 --> 05:17.651
50! £50,000 for this!

05:18.621 --> 05:21.691
I'd rather EAT the money.

05:21.691 --> 05:26.401
You do hear it said that
there's no such thing as a bad car.

05:26.401 --> 05:31.741
Clearly with the VW Toe-rag that's
not the case! They still make them.

05:31.741 --> 05:36.791
When I was a lad we'd get cars
from Wartburgs and Polski-Fiats,

05:36.791 --> 05:41.181
British Leyland
and other left-wing dictatorships.

05:41.181 --> 05:44.031
But you do still get 'em.

05:44.031 --> 05:47.401
Does anybody here own an Audi A2?

05:47.401 --> 05:51.241
That's a bad car.
They're not going to admit it.

05:51.241 --> 05:55.101
It's made of beer tins
and the windows are too small.

05:55.101 --> 05:59.741
You can't open the bonnet.
If you put the wipers on, the car rocks.

05:59.741 --> 06:04.651
That's right, but the
worse thing is the price - £17,000!

06:04.651 --> 06:07.381
You could buy a car for that!

06:08.941 --> 06:11.531
What about the Hyundai Sonata?

06:11.531 --> 06:15.301
That's the same car as...
Kia Magentis.

06:15.301 --> 06:19.961
Buy a Kia Magentis and for a £1,000
more you can have a Hyundai Sonata.

06:19.961 --> 06:24.021
When I asked why they said,
"You're paying for the name!"

06:24.021 --> 06:26.581
LAUGHTER

06:26.581 --> 06:30.261
Anybody here
got any ideas of a bad car?

06:30.261 --> 06:35.401
Hold on a minute. Daewoo.
Which one? A Lamos.

06:35.401 --> 06:40.501
They ARE shocking. The problem is we
can't remember why they're shocking.

06:40.501 --> 06:45.241
It didn't have any effect.
It just passes you by. Anyone else?

06:45.241 --> 06:49.221
Hold on a minute. Vauxhall VX 220.

06:49.221 --> 06:52.021
Out! Come on!

06:52.021 --> 06:54.051
LAUGHTER

06:54.051 --> 06:57.321
Out! Right the way over here!

06:57.321 --> 07:03.041
The Vauxhall VX 220 is a fine car
in every way. Go on! Out!

07:03.041 --> 07:06.306
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

07:09.541 --> 07:13.121
Sorry about that. I've
just driven a new Vauxhall VX220.

07:13.121 --> 07:16.111
It's brilliant! Wonderful!

07:16.111 --> 07:18.901
No-one said a Vauxhall Vectra.

07:18.901 --> 07:22.231
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's a good car!

07:22.231 --> 07:26.861
He's come here in a
turtleneck jumper with face hair!

07:26.861 --> 07:32.021
Why is it good? It'll do anything
on the motorway if you're a rep.

07:32.021 --> 07:37.391
I'm not a rep, are you? No.
Why the hell are you interested?

07:38.681 --> 07:41.861
What DO you drive? A TVR.

07:41.861 --> 07:45.311
Has it ever broken down?
Twice. Why?

07:45.311 --> 07:50.231
Something they didn't tell me about.
The other time it was something else.

07:50.231 --> 07:54.501
He's interested in his engine!
LAUGHTER

07:54.501 --> 07:58.591
What I want you to do
is to write down

07:58.591 --> 08:02.581
what you think is the
worst car on sale today.

08:02.581 --> 08:07.401
Can we have music?
It won't take long.

08:07.401 --> 08:10.261
Let's have a look.

08:10.261 --> 08:13.751
That's amazing!
What are the chances of that?

08:13.751 --> 08:16.345
We've all said the same!

08:21.961 --> 08:25.631
The rules of sports car building
are simple.

08:25.631 --> 08:29.261
It must
look good both outside and inside.

08:29.261 --> 08:32.131
It must ride and handle well.

08:32.131 --> 08:35.231
How does the Lexus SC430 do?

08:35.231 --> 08:42.421
It's none of those things which is
an achievement cos most cars would
manage to get two out of four right.

08:44.321 --> 08:47.271
I mean, just look at this wood!

08:47.271 --> 08:52.001
That is the car equivalent
of a giant cabinet for your telly.

08:52.001 --> 08:57.471
It's not as if they had a miserable
Changing Rooms budget of £500.

08:57.471 --> 09:00.271
They had bucket-loads of cash.

09:00.271 --> 09:03.611
They still came up
with a Mexican hacienda.

09:03.611 --> 09:08.191
When it was first launched,
the SC430 came with run flat tyres

09:08.191 --> 09:11.191
which of course are virtually solid.

09:11.191 --> 09:14.131
Fred Flintstone had similar ones.

09:14.131 --> 09:17.391
Believe me, it made for a hard ride.

09:17.391 --> 09:22.431
Quite recently Lexus waved the
white flag and replaced the tyres

09:22.431 --> 09:25.911
with ordinary ones
to soften the suspension.

09:25.911 --> 09:28.831
But not enough - not by a long way.

09:28.831 --> 09:32.251
It's not
hard and communicative enough

09:32.251 --> 09:36.871
for a sporty chassis
nor comfy enough to be a cruiser.

09:36.871 --> 09:39.571
It's a dreadful compromise.

09:39.571 --> 09:43.791
It's horrible.
I don't like driving it at all.

09:43.791 --> 09:49.211
The engine people did well.
282 admirably smooth horsepower.

09:49.211 --> 09:53.051
It IS a good engine
and so is the stereo.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.179
Once you've waited
for the gates to open!

10:01.251 --> 10:04.118
The roof could have been good too.

10:05.151 --> 10:10.471
Look at that! One minute it's got a
roof, the next it hasn't. Brilliant!

10:10.471 --> 10:14.157
Hasn't got a boot now.
It's full of roof.

10:20.651 --> 10:24.001
Utterly, utterly useless!

10:24.001 --> 10:27.451
Mind you, they are leather.
There's a label.

10:27.451 --> 10:30.386
I suspect it will be left on.

10:31.761 --> 10:34.662
Lexus can and do make good cars.

10:36.481 --> 10:41.011
But when they came to make
a sports coupe it all went wrong.

10:41.011 --> 10:45.281
They didn't follow
the simple rules which is a shame.

10:45.281 --> 10:48.591
If you do,
anybody can make a good sports car.

10:51.561 --> 10:56.191
Even Hyundai,
whose pedigree isn't exactly Lotus.

10:56.191 --> 11:01.829
When they started making cars,
their background was in trains,

11:01.829 --> 11:06.439
really heavy industrial stuff.

11:06.439 --> 11:11.959
It's like JCB saying, "Our diggers
are good, so let's try a car. "

11:11.959 --> 11:15.259
Not all is out of the top drawer.

11:15.259 --> 11:19.419
Look at the interior!
I'm sure it will last,

11:19.419 --> 11:22.775
but it has a whiff of the Amstrad.

11:24.709 --> 11:30.029
Unlike the Lexus, that's where
the moaning stops. Just look at it!

11:30.029 --> 11:36.039
There have been moans that it cribs
the looks of the Ferrari 456.

11:36.039 --> 11:39.419
Sorry? You can buy a £18,500 coupe

11:39.419 --> 11:42.019
that looks like a Ferrari.

11:42.019 --> 11:45.409
That's a bad thing, is it? Right.

11:45.409 --> 11:48.619
Then, there's the chassis.

11:48.619 --> 11:53.419
The Lexus feels flabby
and charmless but this feels sharp.

11:53.419 --> 11:56.439
It's egging me on to go quicker.

11:56.439 --> 12:02.259
This is a good drive,
and I don't mean just for £18,500.

12:02.259 --> 12:05.524
It's just a good drive. Fact.

12:07.579 --> 12:10.719
It's not massively powerful.

12:10.719 --> 12:14.928
This is the top spec 2.7L V6,
with only 165bhp.

12:17.079 --> 12:22.739
What it has is a six-speed gearbox,
which makes the most of that 165bhp.

12:22.739 --> 12:25.219
It makes up for it.

12:25.219 --> 12:28.188
It sounds nice - I like this car.

12:30.199 --> 12:33.199
In fact, for £18,500,

12:33.199 --> 12:36.019
this is a proper charmer.

12:36.019 --> 12:40.444
The Lexus looks like a fat
£50,000 folly.

12:49.879 --> 12:55.639
This is the new Citroen C2.
Talk about knowing your market.

12:55.639 --> 12:59.909
Citroen has already fitted
big flared wheel arches

12:59.909 --> 13:02.999
so you can get 16" rims under them.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.629
I like it. You like it?

13:05.629 --> 13:07.189
Yes!

13:07.189 --> 13:11.879
You don't, do you? I do. I don't
like that ready modified look.

13:11.879 --> 13:17.599
It should be one or the other.
You live in Gloucestershire. I do!

13:17.599 --> 13:22.639
IN WEST COUNTRy ACCENT: If it's not
Massey Ferguson, you don't like it.

13:22.639 --> 13:26.279
Not sturdy, and no power take-off.

13:26.279 --> 13:29.199
Can I do one now?

13:29.199 --> 13:35.239
Porsche has a race championship
called the Porsche Carrera Cup
of Great Britain.

13:35.239 --> 13:41.039
They're producing a road version
of the car competing in that -
the 911 GT3.

13:41.039 --> 13:43.639
They've done GT3s before.

13:43.639 --> 13:49.679
This is the new one. It's stunning,
and it's not just the looks.
It's 381bhp.

13:49.679 --> 13:56.169
0-60 in 4.5 seconds.
It costs £72,000,
but it's racetrack technology.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.599
I get confused with 911s.

13:58.599 --> 14:02.719
Is that turbo? No,
it's normally aspirated.

14:02.719 --> 14:08.679
The GT2's a turbo and the turbo's
a turbo, obviously. Yes.

14:08.679 --> 14:11.839
Why's a GT2 not a turbo? It is.

14:11.839 --> 14:16.889
Why's it CALLED a GT2, not a turbo?
Because the turbo's the turbo.

14:16.889 --> 14:22.259
You couldn't... See? Does anyone
understand the 911 range? No?

14:22.259 --> 14:26.279
Boredom. They've made the same car
for 100 years,

14:26.279 --> 14:31.449
and all they think of is, "We'll
have GT2, GT3, turbo, GT2, GT1... "

14:31.449 --> 14:35.899
Must be fun going into the dealer
and asking for one -

14:35.899 --> 14:38.589
Iike ordering breakfast in America.

14:38.589 --> 14:43.399
"I just want eggs!"
"Just give me a Porsche!"

14:43.399 --> 14:50.799
If you're feeling even more wealthy,
for £330,000, another Porsche racer,
the Carrera GT.

14:50.799 --> 14:55.639
We've waited for this since it was
at the Paris Motor Show in 2000.

14:55.639 --> 14:58.239
Glorious. Stunning.

14:58.239 --> 15:01.479
Look at this! Look at this! Aah!

15:01.479 --> 15:03.159
V10...

15:03.159 --> 15:06.569
5.7L, 612bph.

15:06.569 --> 15:10.639
How much? £330,000.
AUDIENCE GASPS

15:10.639 --> 15:13.209
What?! You should do that -

15:13.209 --> 15:15.529
"Oooh!"

15:15.529 --> 15:21.209
This doesn't happen often,
a new Bristol - the Fighter.

15:21.209 --> 15:25.759
It's the Mk II, as the first
was a biplane launched in 1916.

15:25.759 --> 15:32.419
This is more promising.
It's a two door gullwing supercar,
costing £230,000.

15:32.419 --> 15:35.009
210mph.

15:35.009 --> 15:38.399
V10 engine, 525bhp.

15:38.399 --> 15:45.419
The same engine as a Dodge Viper?
Essentially, but it has more power
in the Bristol.

15:45.419 --> 15:48.229
Why? Dunno. Mahogany crank shaft?!

15:48.229 --> 15:50.209
LAUGHTER

15:50.209 --> 15:54.059
I loved Bristols when I was a kid...

15:54.059 --> 15:59.299
LAUGHTER
No, they got confused, James.

15:59.299 --> 16:02.809
You loved Bristols as a child?

16:02.809 --> 16:07.999
I loved bristols, then I found cars.
I fancied the idea of a Bristol.

16:07.999 --> 16:13.069
I live 1.5 miles from the Bristol
showroom in South Kensington.

16:13.069 --> 16:18.229
It's the only one, so I thought
I'd go and drive a Bristol.

16:18.229 --> 16:22.609
They wouldn't let me in,
because I know you!

16:22.609 --> 16:26.669
The problem is, I once drove
a Bristol.

16:26.669 --> 16:31.667
All I said in the road test
was that the glove box handle

16:31.667 --> 16:36.187
Iooked like a 1940s telephone flex,
a Herriot thing.

16:36.187 --> 16:41.107
That was it. "You're banned,
you'll never drive another Bristol. "

16:41.107 --> 16:44.727
Not devastating - "I'll use the SL. "

16:44.727 --> 16:50.727
On the phone, they used to say,
"May I help you? " Now it's,
"Do you know Jeremy? "

16:50.727 --> 16:54.174
Say yes, you get a Bakelite click.

16:55.867 --> 16:58.737
Excellent news on insider dealing.

16:58.737 --> 17:01.467
We, the British car-buying public,

17:01.467 --> 17:05.807
have the British car dealer
over a barrel. Oh, good!

17:05.807 --> 17:11.637
Last year was a record year
in the UK for car sales. Yeah.

17:11.637 --> 17:15.527
This year isn't -
war, recession and the rest.

17:15.527 --> 17:18.967
They can't turn it around
very quickly.

17:18.967 --> 17:24.186
They were geared up for huge demand,
so they've got too many cars.

17:24.186 --> 17:27.367
They're relying on preregistration.

17:27.367 --> 17:30.307
To keep their figures looking good,

17:30.307 --> 17:35.467
manufacturers and importers
will sell a car to themselves

17:35.467 --> 17:39.537
and put it on the forecourt
as an ex-demonstrator.

17:39.537 --> 17:43.527
These cars are new.
They've done a few miles,

17:43.527 --> 17:47.077
but technically,
they're second-hand.

17:47.077 --> 17:49.527
What does this do to prices?

17:49.527 --> 17:54.637
I found a Ford Focus TDCi,
a great car, £14,995 list,

17:54.637 --> 17:57.027
for £10,995.

17:57.027 --> 18:02.197
A sizeable amount! Fantastic deal!
It's only had a numberplate put on.

18:02.197 --> 18:05.947
It IS a new car.
New, with a numberplate.

18:05.947 --> 18:10.607
Sports cars - you'd expect us
to say, "It's almost summer,

18:10.607 --> 18:13.087
"don't buy a sports car.

18:13.087 --> 18:16.097
"Everyone wants one, prices go up. "

18:16.097 --> 18:21.257
Here's a tip - it's not true. It's
over supply. Let's take the MX5.

18:21.257 --> 18:23.817
Loads have come over from Japan.

18:23.817 --> 18:28.277
They couldn't say,
"Send them back to Japan. "

18:28.277 --> 18:33.627
They're piled up
in a car supermarket in Manchester.

18:33.627 --> 18:38.357
The 1. 8iS is the best engine,
suspension and nicest alloy wheels.

18:38.357 --> 18:41.737
The Mazda MX5
is the best two-seater.

18:41.737 --> 18:44.637
It's the one I'd have.

18:44.637 --> 18:49.837
I've found it with £3,525 off,
which makes it £14,500,

18:49.837 --> 18:54.427
which is less than you'd pay
for the basic 1. 6.

18:54.427 --> 18:56.637
That's a bargain!

18:56.637 --> 19:00.847
Ever found £1 down the sofa?
Yes, I have.

19:00.847 --> 19:04.157
You can't get much for £1 today. No.

19:04.157 --> 19:08.767
You can't get half a bitter. No.
But you can buy a car.

19:08.767 --> 19:13.557
You can go into a Kia dealership
with £1 and drive away in a Rio.

19:13.557 --> 19:17.837
I presume
there's more to pay after that. Yes.

19:17.837 --> 19:21.877
It's a five-year deal,
about £120.30 a month.

19:21.877 --> 19:26.637
At the end, there's £50 payment
to secure the car as yours.

19:26.637 --> 19:29.367
Obviously, that's an APR of 8.1%.

19:29.367 --> 19:34.337
You can go out with a pound...
..and come back with a car!

19:34.337 --> 19:38.697
You can't do that
in the toy shop near me.

19:38.697 --> 19:42.337
That's true!
You can get a Kia! A real one!

19:44.057 --> 19:47.797
Which country makes
the fastest supercar?

19:47.797 --> 19:51.937
What do we have
in the supercar line-up?

19:51.937 --> 19:54.977
From Germany, the Porsche 911.

19:54.977 --> 19:57.827
From Japan, the Honda NSX.

19:57.827 --> 20:03.057
From the USA, and the closest thing
they make to a sports car,

20:03.057 --> 20:06.217
the Chevrolet Corvette.

20:06.217 --> 20:11.827
From France, the only supercar
they build, the Venturi Atlantique.

20:11.827 --> 20:16.937
And from Italy, what else
but the gorgeous Ferrari 360?

20:16.937 --> 20:22.757
And finally, the UK representative,
our tatty, Top Gear Jag.

20:22.757 --> 20:27.897
This, remember, is the same Jag
we bought last series for pennies

20:27.897 --> 20:32.747
and stripped down to see
if we could make it go any faster.

20:32.747 --> 20:36.937
It's worthless,
so, this should be good!

20:36.937 --> 20:40.873
ENGINES REV

20:43.577 --> 20:48.276
And perhaps rather predictably,
the Jag embarrasses itself.

20:50.337 --> 20:53.124
Oh, dear!

20:55.187 --> 20:57.737
What was the result?

20:57.737 --> 21:01.907
Porsche first,
Ferrari second, Honda third.

21:01.907 --> 21:04.587
The Jaguar was rubbish! Yes!

21:04.587 --> 21:09.267
It took 18.5 seconds to do
the standing quarter-mile. Poor!

21:09.267 --> 21:14.017
Put a German engine in it. No,
that's what they'd expect us to do.

21:14.017 --> 21:18.417
We've got a secret weapon.
We'll try again later.

21:18.417 --> 21:24.067
Right! What are you doing? Putting
this on to honour our guest tonight.

21:24.067 --> 21:28.187
In the history
of American cop shows,

21:28.187 --> 21:33.117
this man has had his bottom chewed
by an angry black police captain

21:33.117 --> 21:36.147
more than anyone else.

21:36.147 --> 21:39.127
From Starsky and Hutch, David Soul!

21:44.267 --> 21:46.977
Hello! Hello.

21:46.977 --> 21:49.747
Have a seat.

21:49.747 --> 21:52.247
Ah!

21:52.247 --> 21:55.437
I remember that from somewhere.

21:55.437 --> 21:58.767
You didn't wear the cardies,
did you?

21:58.767 --> 22:01.367
You're trying too hard with that!

22:01.367 --> 22:05.507
It's good!
It's a sweater! It's a cardigan!

22:05.507 --> 22:09.907
It does up.
You were bomber jacket man.

22:09.907 --> 22:14.007
They dressed me in leather.
Really? Yeah.

22:14.007 --> 22:16.397
Cool, compared to Michael Glaser.

22:16.397 --> 22:19.247
Actually, the way we set trends...

22:19.247 --> 22:23.207
We didn't know
we were setting a trend.

22:23.207 --> 22:27.207
We fought -
he's got a blue shirt, I want one.

22:27.207 --> 22:32.707
You lost. He got the cardigan...
Yes, cardigan and a pair of jeans.

22:32.707 --> 22:38.407
He got the Torino, you got
a bomber jacket. What was your car?

22:38.407 --> 22:41.307
A Ford Fairlane. Rubbish!

22:41.307 --> 22:44.407
Actually, on a flat out straight,

22:44.407 --> 22:47.307
my car outdid the red tomato.

22:47.307 --> 22:50.807
Really? Yeah.
That's what I called it.

22:50.807 --> 22:54.327
Did you have any idea
when you filmed,

22:54.327 --> 22:57.087
how much of an impact that car had?

22:57.087 --> 23:01.887
I grew up in Yorkshire. Everybody
had a white stripe on their car!

23:01.887 --> 23:06.477
Everybody thought
they were Starsky and Hutch!

23:06.477 --> 23:09.207
No, that's very true.

23:09.207 --> 23:13.967
It was probably next to...
It was probably the star of the show.

23:13.967 --> 23:17.687
We won't have that!
YOU were the stars.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.897
I just wanted to hear you say that!

23:20.897 --> 23:25.267
Were you aware
of the impact you had? The car?

23:25.267 --> 23:28.767
The show. You were aware...?
Little by little.

23:28.767 --> 23:34.377
You're shut away in the studio for
the first year. You don't see folks.

23:34.377 --> 23:37.207
You're working 18 hours a day.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.007
Slowly, the popularity spread.

23:40.007 --> 23:43.867
The first year,
it didn't do too well.

23:43.867 --> 23:48.557
The second year, it took off.
Mmm. Cops loved it.

23:48.557 --> 23:53.427
On that show, I didn't get a ticket!
Really? Where was it filmed?

23:53.427 --> 23:55.997
Los Angeles.

23:55.997 --> 23:59.567
I drove down the Ventura Freeway
at 110mph.

23:59.567 --> 24:03.157
I saw the light behind me.

24:03.157 --> 24:08.197
"Oh! Here it comes. "
The guy pulled up next to me.

24:08.197 --> 24:12.213
He'd recognise me in the car
and he'd go...

24:16.117 --> 24:18.557
I get that. You know?

24:18.557 --> 24:22.084
I get,
"I'm gonna write you a ticket. "

24:23.717 --> 24:28.667
Now, I think you are
our first American guest.

24:28.667 --> 24:32.228
Why can't the Americans make cars?

24:34.547 --> 24:39.917
Why...? The Mustang was a brief blip.
It's been 100 years of horror.

24:39.917 --> 24:45.082
I had a Corvette and I loved it.
What did you like about that?

24:46.237 --> 24:49.027
I realised a dream in that car.

24:49.027 --> 24:54.197
I went out to the desert with a girl
I was with and we took clothes off.

24:54.197 --> 24:58.137
Stark naked
and the Mohabi desert is huge.

24:58.137 --> 25:03.147
And there's nothing but a straight
road and I floored that sucker

25:03.147 --> 25:08.077
and went 135mph stark naked
in the middle of the desert.

25:08.077 --> 25:10.717
LAUGHTER

25:10.717 --> 25:14.037
One of the things you wanna do...

25:14.037 --> 25:18.017
Yes, in that list of things
you want to do before you die.

25:18.017 --> 25:24.077
Drive a 'Vette,
naked across the desert...
But it wouldn't be a 'Vette.

25:24.077 --> 25:28.397
A terrible car. Well,
I won't tell you what happened then!

25:28.397 --> 25:30.957
Yes, you will!

25:30.957 --> 25:34.037
LAUGHTER

25:34.037 --> 25:39.597
You're not here to relive the old
days, you're here to drive our car

25:39.597 --> 25:42.837
around our track. That's the idea.

25:42.837 --> 25:47.837
That's the idea, absolutely. We
had the car especially decorated.

25:47.837 --> 25:50.517
Anyone want to guess what we did?!

25:50.517 --> 25:53.657
Let's have a look at your lap.

25:57.937 --> 26:02.637
Here we go. You look a bit
concentrate-y there.

26:02.637 --> 26:07.767
The Stig tells me that you were
a very, very good driver.

26:07.767 --> 26:14.172
You were the first guest in with
a shout of beating our current
leader, Jay Kay, on 1.48.

26:16.037 --> 26:18.757
A bit violent with the gear box

26:18.757 --> 26:22.047
if I may just say. Hold on...

26:22.047 --> 26:24.163
Coming up...

26:24.477 --> 26:26.377
What happened?

26:26.377 --> 26:32.077
All these people have driven
our reasonably priced cars,

26:32.077 --> 26:34.647
without a single bit of trouble.

26:34.647 --> 26:38.797
We get the first American on,

26:38.797 --> 26:45.257
and you broke it!
You broke the gear box!

26:45.257 --> 26:48.887
But we have a back up Suzuki Liana,

26:48.887 --> 26:53.957
just in case, by some miracle, it
went wrong. We sent him out in that.

26:53.957 --> 26:57.767
Let's have a look what happened.

26:57.767 --> 27:01.057
Second car, coming along.

27:01.057 --> 27:05.957
Into the next bend, still being
violent with the gearbox.

27:05.957 --> 27:09.575
And, into the second-to-last corner.

27:11.447 --> 27:14.437
Last corner.

27:14.437 --> 27:16.655
And...

27:17.847 --> 27:19.887
LAUGHTER

27:19.887 --> 27:24.387
It's the second one you've broken.
You didn't have to bring that up!

27:24.387 --> 27:27.107
How to ruin a show quick, huh?

27:27.107 --> 27:31.707
Ask Soul to come on.
I can't believe this car!

27:31.707 --> 27:35.137
Ladies and gentlemen,
he broke two of them!

27:35.137 --> 27:38.347
APPLAUSE

27:38.347 --> 27:45.747
I'm sorry to break this to you,
but the clock was running on your
first lap and you did set a time.

27:45.747 --> 27:50.500
I'm going to write it up.
Now, bear in mind,

27:50.500 --> 27:55.300
the Stig took this guy out
and I'm not kidding

27:55.300 --> 28:00.300
after what you've done
to our precious car.

28:00.300 --> 28:04.290
He said you were as good as JK
and were up for beating him.

28:04.290 --> 28:07.580
But you didn't. In fact,

28:07.580 --> 28:14.008
you did one minute and 54 seconds,
ladies and gentlemen.
CHEERING

28:19.060 --> 28:24.200
And that was coasting
the last 300 yards.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.620
Yes, you might have been up here.
But you're not.

28:27.620 --> 28:30.580
We must save up and have you again.

28:30.580 --> 28:33.720
David Soul!
APPLAUSE

28:33.720 --> 28:37.190
Thank you. Thank you.

28:40.400 --> 28:45.167
What would you say
to Perodua Kelisa? Bless you!

28:49.130 --> 28:51.620
Prod-dod-ula? No.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.820
Per-og-ulja.

28:53.820 --> 28:56.470
Per-rod-ula? No.

28:56.470 --> 28:59.140
Per-rod-ua. Produa!

28:59.140 --> 29:01.720
Prodja. Near enough.

29:01.720 --> 29:05.406
Prod... proj... produla.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.320
A bacon sandwich.

29:11.320 --> 29:14.140
And this is a car.

29:14.140 --> 29:18.480
It isn't going to get much more
complicated than that.

29:18.480 --> 29:22.240
The Perodua Kelisa,
Britain's cheapest new car.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.993
It's yours from £5,000.

29:26.320 --> 29:31.330
A bacon sarnie isn't dribbled with
jus or served "on a bed of",

29:31.330 --> 29:35.840
and the Kelisa doesn't come
with fatuous brand attributes

29:35.840 --> 29:38.530
or lifestyle marketing messages.

29:38.530 --> 29:40.862
A basic meal and a basic car.

29:45.810 --> 29:51.040
There was a time when Britain's
cheapest motor was truly horrible.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.280
Like a Lada. This is promising.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.740
It's made in Malaysia

29:56.740 --> 30:01.541
in a new factory rather than slung
together by resentful communists.

30:09.640 --> 30:13.200
It's got everything you'd expect.
An engine.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.840
Small - three cylinders.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.640
Seats. Instruments.

30:18.640 --> 30:22.820
The windows go up and down. A boot.

30:22.820 --> 30:28.270
It's built down. The dashboard's
shiny, but it's all there.

30:28.270 --> 30:30.380
It's got airbags.

30:30.380 --> 30:36.640
Britain's cheapest car used to be
a polite way of saying "rubbish".
Not any more.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.820
The Perodua is perfectly OK.

30:38.820 --> 30:44.340
I wasn't expecting more and
I wasn't expecting entertainment.

30:44.340 --> 30:47.260
This whole car is full of "feel".

30:47.260 --> 30:52.920
It's a simple thing - small tyres.
The engine has to be thrashed.

30:52.920 --> 30:58.130
You get a sense that there's not
much between you and the oily bits.

30:58.130 --> 31:01.840
The real secret
is that it's so light.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.770
It's 150kg lighter than a Ford Ka.

31:04.770 --> 31:08.683
That's like throwing two passengers
out, it's lively.

31:11.930 --> 31:14.800
I actually like it. It's a laugh.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.650
It's essence of driving, no garnish.

31:17.650 --> 31:23.280
I might get letters for saying
this, but it's the nearest thing

31:23.280 --> 31:26.511
I've driven to the original Mini.

31:29.900 --> 31:34.640
OK, it's not a Ferrari, but James,
I'm with you on this one.

31:34.640 --> 31:38.290
I think it's great.
I love the little noises it makes.

31:38.290 --> 31:44.690
That little three-cylinder engine
and the clang
when you slam the doors.

31:44.690 --> 31:50.640
You weren't strictly honest. That's
not the five grand one, is it?

31:50.640 --> 31:53.910
No, I came over aspirational.

31:53.910 --> 31:58.290
I got the GX with electric windows
and two tone upholstery.

31:58.290 --> 32:01.850
It's £5,800. That's still fantastic.

32:01.850 --> 32:05.130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:05.130 --> 32:10.010
It's made in a jungle clearing by
someone who went to work on an ox!

32:10.010 --> 32:12.930
I think you're missing the point.

32:12.930 --> 32:17.250
That's why I'm siding with him.
That's a cracker of a car.

32:17.250 --> 32:21.510
I can't be bothered to argue.
It may be nice to drive,

32:21.510 --> 32:25.680
but I'm going to do an experiment.
I've got the keys.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.970
OK, you. Right?

32:27.970 --> 32:32.639
How do I say it? Perodua. Perodua.

32:32.639 --> 32:35.049
Watch this.

32:35.049 --> 32:38.052
Perodua Kelisa.

32:41.749 --> 32:44.869
Nothing. Absolutely no response.

32:44.869 --> 32:47.769
It ain't perfect, but it's good.

32:47.769 --> 32:54.609
However. You might be more
interested - and I'm not being
sexist - in what I'll do now.

32:54.609 --> 32:58.109
I'm going to make
a pair of trousers.

32:58.109 --> 33:00.899
I've got everything I need.

33:00.899 --> 33:06.569
Material, a zip. I've got a Phaff
2022 Lifestyle sewing machine.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.769
Cutting edge.

33:08.769 --> 33:11.409
I'll show you the controls.

33:11.409 --> 33:14.049
That's the traction control.

33:14.049 --> 33:16.129
There's my throttle.

33:16.129 --> 33:19.609
All we have to do -
I've already started -

33:19.609 --> 33:22.019
the strides here.

33:22.019 --> 33:24.169
Lift up the foot.

33:24.169 --> 33:27.718
Slide it in. This is not a joke,
OK?

33:29.339 --> 33:36.379
I know how to drive it. My mother
had a soft toy factory. I could sew
before I could ride a bike!

33:36.379 --> 33:41.469
And I can cook. It's what makes me
so attractive with women.

33:41.469 --> 33:45.009
LAUGHTER
Why are they laughing again?

33:45.009 --> 33:50.659
Anyway, here we go.
I've got the foot lever down.

33:50.659 --> 33:54.029
A simple seam. No overlocking.

33:54.029 --> 33:56.668
Oh, my God!

33:58.219 --> 34:01.569
This may take a little while.

34:01.569 --> 34:06.769
We'll do something else and come
back later for a trouser update.

34:06.769 --> 34:09.369
LAUGHTER

34:09.369 --> 34:11.478
Right.

34:11.478 --> 34:19.438
Earlier our glorious Jaguar XJS was
battered by the might of the world's
supercars in a straight line fight.

34:19.438 --> 34:24.559
But we're not going to leave it
at that. We're having another go.

34:24.559 --> 34:29.212
But this time the Jag has got
a trick up its trousers.

34:38.779 --> 34:43.609
The Top Gear warhorse will take on
the best the world has to offer.

34:43.609 --> 34:46.359
How are we gonna do that?

34:46.359 --> 34:50.688
We'll cheat.
With the help of the wizards of NOS.

34:50.688 --> 34:55.219
NOS is Nitrous Oxide System.
The guys who fit it are the wizards.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.969
How much difference will this make?

34:57.969 --> 35:04.259
The system can deliver up to 500Hp
extra. Over and above? That's right.

35:04.259 --> 35:06.919
Just simply, how does it work?

35:06.919 --> 35:13.919
We feed nitrous oxide into the
engine. We mix that with extra fuel.

35:13.919 --> 35:18.719
The combination of the two burns in
the engine and produces more power.

35:18.719 --> 35:22.259
And if the percentages are wrong?
Too much fuel

35:22.259 --> 35:27.699
and it'll reduce power. Too
much nitrous could melt something.

35:27.699 --> 35:31.863
Like the engine? Yes.
So you'll probably break our car.

35:38.859 --> 35:43.259
And there they are -
£500,000 of super cars

35:43.259 --> 35:49.439
against a £200 Jag - albeit with a
few hundred quid of nitrous added.

35:49.439 --> 35:53.499
I just hope it makes it
to the start line.

35:53.499 --> 35:58.519
For this run the nitrous will give
our old heap an extra 200Hp -

35:58.519 --> 36:01.419
a total of 500. Will it be enough?

36:01.419 --> 36:04.519
And will it hold together?

36:04.519 --> 36:08.689
Oh, yes. Straight away
you can see the difference!

36:08.689 --> 36:13.899
It's passed the Venturi, the
Corvett, the Honda, the Ferrari 360.

36:13.899 --> 36:20.350
But the question is, can it hold
off that mighty Porsche 911 Turbo?

36:23.589 --> 36:26.879
Yes! It can!
APPLAUSE

36:26.879 --> 36:32.399
Ah! Fantastic. There's life
in the old warhorse yet.

36:32.399 --> 36:39.319
A £250 Jag, £500 worth of nitrous
and it does a quarter in 13 seconds.

36:39.319 --> 36:44.529
That's faster than a Porsche 911
Turbo and a Ferrari 360.

36:44.529 --> 36:47.399
Now for some more trouser action.

36:47.399 --> 36:52.209
Thanks, Richard. I have good news.
My trousers are finished.

36:52.209 --> 36:57.489
I've got a member of the production
team to model them for me.

36:57.489 --> 37:03.200
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

37:05.929 --> 37:12.249
I don't know how that happened.
I had the material, I had the zip.

37:12.249 --> 37:15.179
I just made a complete hash of it.

37:15.179 --> 37:19.589
That's exactly what happened
with the BMW Z8.

37:19.589 --> 37:23.239
BMW had the best brains
in the business.

37:23.239 --> 37:27.529
They had an M5 engine,
a trick rear axle,

37:27.529 --> 37:30.439
they even got Bond to drive one.

37:30.439 --> 37:36.479
It should've been spectacularly
good. But that's what they expected.

37:36.479 --> 37:41.951
It turned out to be awful. Let me
show you what it was like to drive.

37:45.779 --> 37:50.796
LAUGHTER

37:53.789 --> 37:56.069
Ah, yes.

37:56.069 --> 37:58.999
Exactly what a Z8 is like to drive.

37:58.999 --> 38:03.197
There's a sense of
"Ooh! What will happen next?! "

38:06.729 --> 38:10.989
The problem was, they didn't know

38:10.989 --> 38:16.929
what they wanted the Z8 to be -
sports car, muscle car, cruiser.

38:16.929 --> 38:21.992
And it's ended up as a sort of
browny green mush of all three.

38:27.499 --> 38:32.369
Happily, BMW recently announced
that they will stop making it.

38:32.369 --> 38:37.949
But, before it goes to the dusty
vaults of history, a German company

38:37.949 --> 38:41.419
has had one last attempt
to get it right.

38:47.269 --> 38:50.209
This is the Alpina Z8.

38:50.209 --> 38:55.599
You can tell it's an Alpina because
of its huge wheels and tyres

38:55.599 --> 38:59.769
and because it says
Alpina on the back.

38:59.769 --> 39:05.369
They've made merry with the blue
suede and the equally blue dials.

39:05.369 --> 39:09.559
This looks
just as good as the original

39:09.559 --> 39:15.209
and it's just as left-hand drive,
but does it go any better?

39:15.209 --> 39:18.394
TYRES SCREECH

39:21.649 --> 39:27.690
After much careful deliberation,
the simple answer is no.

39:30.159 --> 39:34.789
And that's the problem.
Hold your camera!

39:34.789 --> 39:37.959
He can't hold his camera

39:37.959 --> 39:42.569
because you correct the slide
then the whole body weight

39:42.569 --> 39:46.369
is hurled the other way -
you get a pendulum effect.

39:49.309 --> 39:54.155
It ain't no sports car.
That's for sure.

39:56.389 --> 40:03.429
Getting it round a corner is like
getting a wardrobe up a fire escape.

40:03.429 --> 40:08.459
It's very hard work. And it's hard
to see where you're going.

40:08.459 --> 40:14.719
Dearie me. It really doesn't like
this sort of treatment.

40:14.719 --> 40:20.248
If Alpina haven't made it handle
any better, what have they done?

40:20.459 --> 40:23.559
Well, the first thing they did

40:23.559 --> 40:27.239
was take out the 5L engine
and replace it

40:27.239 --> 40:30.589
with their own 4. 8.

40:30.589 --> 40:34.379
Smaller engine - less power.

40:34.379 --> 40:40.219
This must be the first ever tuned
car that's slower than the original.

40:40.219 --> 40:46.549
They replaced the six speed manual
gearbox with a five speed automatic.

40:46.549 --> 40:49.519
This is not looking good.

40:49.519 --> 40:54.079
Then they set about
the suspension and steering

40:54.079 --> 40:57.079
adding some Lenor fabric softener.

40:57.079 --> 41:00.679
So the whole car should then be

41:00.679 --> 41:04.719
as kind to your hands as
Nanette Newman in a pashmina.

41:04.719 --> 41:09.167
It all sounds terribly weird.

41:25.079 --> 41:29.448
But! There was some method
in their madness.

41:35.159 --> 41:39.679
What they've tried to do
is focus the Z8.

41:39.679 --> 41:44.799
Forget the idea of it
being a sports car or a muscle car.

41:44.799 --> 41:49.589
They've tried to make it
a pure West Coast cruising machine.

41:53.959 --> 41:59.519
It's aimed at people who care more
about underpants than understeer.

41:59.519 --> 42:06.679
The sort of person who wants
to dawdle along, top down
with a burble from the exhaust

42:06.679 --> 42:10.409
and a Pete Cetera warble
from the stereo.

42:10.409 --> 42:13.459
Unfortunately it hasn't worked.

42:13.459 --> 42:17.829
The exhaust doesn't burble, listen.
ENGINE GROWLS

42:17.829 --> 42:20.239
That's a shriek.

42:20.239 --> 42:23.599
To drive,
it feels like a coffee table.

42:23.599 --> 42:28.659
The suspension's still far too hard
and the steering's still too heavy.

42:28.659 --> 42:34.319
It's a heffalump.
In fact, I have to be honest.

42:34.319 --> 42:37.279
I am hard pressed to tell this car

42:37.279 --> 42:39.969
from the original.

42:39.969 --> 42:43.985
Weird then that the price
has gone up to £95,000.

42:47.129 --> 42:51.949
One more thing. There's only
11 Alpina Z8s coming to Britain.

42:51.949 --> 42:56.039
And Ronan Keating
has bought one of them.

42:56.039 --> 42:58.969
Just thought you ought to know.

42:58.969 --> 43:01.551
TYRES SCREECH

43:07.745 --> 43:12.314
Alpina have done good things
with BMWs for over 30 years.

43:12.314 --> 43:17.225
But the Z8's like a delinquent kid.
Born bad and it'll always be bad.

43:17.225 --> 43:20.644
We weren't going to take it
on the track.

43:20.644 --> 43:24.105
Only Ronan Keating
would be interested.

43:24.105 --> 43:26.865
The problem was the Stig.

43:26.865 --> 43:31.684
He's been beside himself all day
because his hero has been here -

43:31.684 --> 43:34.105
David Soul.

43:34.105 --> 43:37.604
He wanted to show off,
so we had to let him.

43:37.604 --> 43:44.084
He's off the line. Hardly any wheel
spin. David Soul won't be impressed.

43:44.084 --> 43:48.444
Remember this has less HP
than the standard Z8.

43:48.444 --> 43:53.905
MUSIC: "Don't Give On Us"

43:53.905 --> 43:57.684
LAUGHTER

43:57.684 --> 44:04.105
That's touching, isn't it? Stig's
been stalking David all day long.

44:04.105 --> 44:06.625
Woo! The Hammerhead, now.

44:06.625 --> 44:11.945
Dab of the brakes, into the corner,
running wide. The tyres howl!

44:11.945 --> 44:16.678
EASY LISTENING MUSIC CONTINUES

44:21.284 --> 44:24.404
The Follow Through. That was quick.

44:24.404 --> 44:29.154
Touch of the brakes. That's unusual.
Even the Stig is struggling.

44:29.154 --> 44:34.564
Very unpredictable handling. Into
Gambon. Sideways! Across the line!

44:34.564 --> 44:37.975
You saw how hard
the Stig struggled there?

44:37.975 --> 44:44.855
Well, you won't believe the time he
did it in. One minute, 29 seconds.

44:44.855 --> 44:49.324
Exactly the same
as a Lamborghini Murcielago.

44:49.324 --> 44:54.684
He is good, isn't he. That Stig
is...that was an incredible time.

44:54.684 --> 45:00.724
David Soul is now leaving the
premises to get away from the Stig.
