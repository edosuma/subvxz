00:39.946 --> 00:42.484
I'm at my wit's end, Sam.

00:43.822 --> 00:45.090
I know, Mom.

00:45.157 --> 00:47.996
I almost called 911 last night.

00:48.062 --> 00:50.367
I had the phone in my hand.

00:51.837 --> 00:54.108
I'm sorry.

00:54.876 --> 00:57.147
Sam.

00:59.719 --> 01:02.592
Don't give up on therapy.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.819
Oh, God, no!

02:17.008 --> 02:18.644
:
No, no.

02:49.005 --> 02:50.808
Hi, Charlie.

02:51.777 --> 02:53.212
You're back.

02:53.279 --> 02:55.284
Well, it's an emergency.

02:55.350 --> 02:57.054
I can see that.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.058
I'm...

02:59.125 --> 03:01.028
trying to...

03:01.095 --> 03:02.966
keep it together with him.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.903
Sound normal.

03:04.970 --> 03:07.040
In control.

03:07.107 --> 03:09.311
If he sees me like this...

03:09.378 --> 03:12.350
- like I really...

03:25.578 --> 03:26.646
Breathe.

03:27.982 --> 03:30.454
- Again.

03:30.522 --> 03:32.792
Oh, you're just like Beth,
with the fucking breathing.

03:36.399 --> 03:38.971
I can't. I can't.

03:39.037 --> 03:41.342
We should talk about Sam.

03:41.409 --> 03:43.347
Well, he just strangled somebody
right in front of me.

03:43.413 --> 03:45.685
I think it's worth noting

03:45.752 --> 03:49.158
that he chose to bring you here
to work with him.

03:51.262 --> 03:53.701
What do I know
about psychopathy?

03:53.768 --> 03:56.540
- I wasn't trained for this.
- None of us are.

03:58.578 --> 04:00.748
Charlie, I need a plan.

04:00.815 --> 04:02.886
I need a plan.
I'm like a second-year,

04:02.952 --> 04:05.024
just throwing shit
against the wall.

04:05.090 --> 04:07.060
You have to find a way

04:07.127 --> 04:08.531
to come out of this alive.

04:08.597 --> 04:10.768
As crazy as it sounds,

04:10.835 --> 04:13.339
I think there is
a conscience in there.

04:13.406 --> 04:15.410
Somewhere.

04:15.477 --> 04:17.982
Little, tiny conscience.

04:19.285 --> 04:21.791
Charlie, that's possible,
isn't it?

04:22.559 --> 04:25.698
That means there's empathy
on some level.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.269
Focus on that.

04:28.336 --> 04:31.041
I work with people
on empathy all the time,

04:31.108 --> 04:34.449
but I've never started
at absolute zero.

04:34.516 --> 04:36.687
- Empty.
- Yeah.

04:36.754 --> 04:39.192
On top of that,
Sam is in charge.

04:39.258 --> 04:41.830
I don't have clinical authority.

04:41.897 --> 04:44.168
Blah, blah, blah.

05:14.228 --> 05:15.932
You have to help me.

05:15.999 --> 05:18.504
If I don't figure this out,
he's going to strangle me,

05:18.571 --> 05:21.009
and I'm going into that grave.

05:21.076 --> 05:23.547
Or the next one.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.852
I know it's crazy...

05:25.919 --> 05:27.789
but I was...

05:27.856 --> 05:30.360
starting to connect with him.

05:30.427 --> 05:32.798
I thought.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.738
I mean, love your patients,
but come on.

05:35.805 --> 05:37.141
A sociopath?

05:37.208 --> 05:40.147
We used to discuss not getting
too stuck in categories.

05:40.213 --> 05:42.017
Right.

05:42.084 --> 05:43.587
It's a spectrum.

05:43.654 --> 05:47.360
Maybe I could push him one way
on the spectrum.

05:48.263 --> 05:50.901
Or I'm deluding myself.

07:07.822 --> 07:10.060
<i>
How was the funeral?</i>

07:10.127 --> 07:12.732
It was a hard day.

07:12.798 --> 07:14.736
Grieving is difficult.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.474
I've never been
to a Jewish funeral.

07:17.541 --> 07:20.447
A funeral's a funeral.

07:20.515 --> 07:23.754
This one probably had
more singing than usual.

07:50.107 --> 07:53.947
Now I'm one of those guys who
buries people in his basement.

07:55.283 --> 07:57.722
Thanks a lot.

08:02.965 --> 08:04.101
Your turn.

08:09.946 --> 08:11.616
Get up.

08:31.422 --> 08:33.760
Over there.

08:49.926 --> 08:52.665
Don't fucking move.

09:09.565 --> 09:11.870
Walk.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.037
Keep this distance.

10:16.566 --> 10:18.335
Go ahead.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.238
Go in at a sharper angle.

10:40.714 --> 10:42.350
Good.

10:46.827 --> 10:49.097
Keep going.

11:18.690 --> 11:22.030
<i>
My whole life,
I have been thinking,</i>

11:22.097 --> 11:25.270
thinking,
trying to figure myself out

11:25.337 --> 11:28.342
so I can help other people
understand themselves

11:28.409 --> 11:30.915
so they can have
better relationships, and now...

11:30.981 --> 11:34.154
here I am, my son is
barely speaking to me.

11:40.568 --> 11:42.705
<i>I might need another
couple of weeks</i>

11:42.772 --> 11:45.711
before getting up in front
of a room full of kids again.

11:45.777 --> 11:48.415
- Do you mind?
- Of course not.

12:31.268 --> 12:34.542
Tell me
how you're feeling right now.

12:34.609 --> 12:36.411
Let's see.

12:36.478 --> 12:38.651
I'm talking
to my dead therapist.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.688
So I'm disassociating.

12:40.755 --> 12:42.925
Other than that, Beth is dead,

12:42.992 --> 12:44.696
Ezra hates me,

12:44.763 --> 12:46.800
and I've been kidnapped

12:46.866 --> 12:49.337
by a serial killer, so...

12:52.811 --> 12:55.316
Why do you keep looking at that?

12:55.383 --> 12:59.358
I'm having a fantasy
of smashing it against his head.

12:59.424 --> 13:00.795
Why don't you do that?

13:00.861 --> 13:02.732
Hit him with the pitcher?

13:02.798 --> 13:06.038
'Cause I don't want to die
any sooner than I need to.

13:06.105 --> 13:08.209
That's very pessimistic.

13:08.275 --> 13:09.813
You have some fight in you.

13:09.879 --> 13:11.448
You used to wrestle
in high school.

13:11.516 --> 13:12.985
Well...

13:13.051 --> 13:15.757
while you have been
relaxing, being dead,

13:15.824 --> 13:19.097
I've been getting older and I'm
not as strong as I used to be.

13:19.164 --> 13:21.135
I don't know why you feel
so powerless.

13:21.202 --> 13:22.839
I don't feel powerless.

13:22.905 --> 13:25.677
I'm doing everything I can to
fight back with what I have.

13:25.744 --> 13:27.380
Are you?

13:32.791 --> 13:34.596
Great.

13:34.662 --> 13:36.064
I'm out of foot cream.

13:36.131 --> 13:38.670
And I'm running out
of my arrhythmia pills.

13:38.737 --> 13:41.375
If this guy doesn't murder me,
I'm gonna die of a heart attack.

13:41.441 --> 13:43.546
Or foot fungus.

13:45.518 --> 13:47.588
Charlie, I need a plan.

13:47.654 --> 13:49.592
I tried pulling
his life story out of him.

13:49.659 --> 13:52.565
I tried getting him
to recontextualize everything

13:52.631 --> 13:54.334
as protecting his mother.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.338
I tried flat-out diverting him.

13:56.405 --> 13:57.942
I, I...

13:58.009 --> 13:59.110
I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

13:59.177 --> 14:00.514
You're going to have

14:00.581 --> 14:02.150
to address the fact
that his mother is,

14:02.217 --> 14:04.454
in part,
responsible for the abuse

14:04.522 --> 14:06.225
he suffered as a child.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.062
If I had five or six years.

14:08.128 --> 14:09.532
- You don't.

14:53.687 --> 14:55.456
Move up.

15:18.670 --> 15:21.475
All right.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.396
All right.

15:48.463 --> 15:50.299
You can sit.

16:28.175 --> 16:30.146
I got to mix the cement.

16:30.213 --> 16:32.851
Sam, could you sit down
for a minute?

16:39.498 --> 16:40.567
Mm-hmm.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.339
I'd like to discuss
the possibility

16:43.406 --> 16:45.710
of you handling this differently.

16:47.279 --> 16:50.587
I'm not sure that you should
bury the body.

16:51.689 --> 16:53.593
What am I supposed to do?

16:53.660 --> 16:55.797
What you usually do.

16:55.864 --> 16:59.471
Leave it where it can be found.

16:59.538 --> 17:02.812
That's the most thoughtful thing
for the relatives.

17:02.878 --> 17:06.820
I've never brought anyone
back to my house before.

17:06.886 --> 17:08.757
They could trace him.

17:08.824 --> 17:10.527
Uh, yeah, he was in my truck.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.197
I understand
your concern about that.

17:12.264 --> 17:13.900
It's reasonable.

17:15.871 --> 17:18.810
We're talking about the stuff
you see on TV?

17:18.877 --> 17:21.214
DNA and...

17:21.281 --> 17:23.386
little pieces of carpet, right?

17:23.452 --> 17:24.889
Yeah.

17:24.955 --> 17:27.628
Well, I'm no expert, I'll admit.

17:27.694 --> 17:29.064
But...

17:29.130 --> 17:31.401
let's, let's think this through.

17:33.940 --> 17:36.278
There must have been DNA

17:36.345 --> 17:38.851
and fibers from your clothing
on the other people.

17:38.917 --> 17:42.157
But the police never traced
any of that back to you.

17:42.223 --> 17:45.898
Is there any reason
your DNA or fingerprints

17:45.965 --> 17:47.735
would be
in some sort of database?

17:47.802 --> 17:50.741
You've never been arrested,
have you?

17:50.808 --> 17:53.078
No, but, like...

17:54.181 --> 17:57.086
...like, uh, carpet fibers...

17:58.055 --> 18:01.128
...from the carpet, they could
trace that back to this house.

18:01.195 --> 18:03.232
Well, that's highly unlikely.

18:03.298 --> 18:06.271
It's what, 20, 30 years old?

18:08.209 --> 18:10.413
I don't know.

18:10.479 --> 18:12.116
Sam...

18:12.183 --> 18:14.420
you want to get better.

18:15.456 --> 18:17.460
I can't pull this out of you.

18:17.527 --> 18:20.901
Therapy is not an exorcism.

18:20.968 --> 18:22.136
Mm-hmm.

18:22.203 --> 18:23.673
You want to change.

18:23.740 --> 18:27.246
A good next step is
to think of Elias's family.

18:27.313 --> 18:29.919
To truly understand

18:29.985 --> 18:32.223
what might be of service to them

18:32.289 --> 18:35.597
emotionally
as fellow human beings.

18:37.066 --> 18:39.705
Given the givens here.

18:49.090 --> 18:50.660
Sam...

18:50.727 --> 18:52.129
come here.

18:52.196 --> 18:53.900
Why?

18:53.966 --> 18:56.572
Trust me.

19:08.997 --> 19:11.434
Take off the blindfold.

19:13.439 --> 19:16.378
We need to see his face.

20:28.523 --> 20:31.695
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

20:32.496 --> 20:35.369
Why did you want me to do this?

20:44.555 --> 20:47.294
You have all your feelings, right?

20:47.360 --> 20:49.497
He was a person

20:49.565 --> 20:51.936
who had feelings of his own
to struggle with.

20:52.003 --> 20:54.575
I want you to see...

20:56.477 --> 20:59.050
...that he was not just some guy

20:59.117 --> 21:00.887
who offended you.

21:00.954 --> 21:03.359
Elias was a human being.

21:03.425 --> 21:05.262
He had a mother and a father

21:05.329 --> 21:09.437
who care about him just like
your mother cares about you.

21:10.372 --> 21:12.844
And they are going to miss him.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.422
You know...

21:18.488 --> 21:20.560
people have techniques

21:20.627 --> 21:22.531
to help them grieve.

21:22.597 --> 21:25.135
For Jews, it's all laid out.

21:25.202 --> 21:27.106
There's the burial,

21:27.173 --> 21:29.878
which is why it's so important
to have a body.

21:29.945 --> 21:32.584
And there's a special week
called shiva,

21:32.651 --> 21:35.456
where we focus just on mourning

21:35.524 --> 21:37.661
and memory.

21:37.727 --> 21:40.265
I always tried to get out of it
a little bit early.

21:40.332 --> 21:43.706
My wife wouldn't let me,
and she was right.

21:45.977 --> 21:48.315
There is a prayer

21:48.382 --> 21:51.121
you say every night
for the first year

21:51.188 --> 21:53.325
after someone dies

21:53.392 --> 21:56.497
and then once a year
afterward forever.

21:57.634 --> 22:00.038
It's called the kaddish.

22:00.974 --> 22:02.578
Should I say it?

22:02.645 --> 22:04.247
What, the kaddish?

22:04.314 --> 22:06.217
Mm-hmm.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.554
I...

22:07.621 --> 22:09.825
L-Let me think about that.

22:10.627 --> 22:13.833
I think the important thing

22:13.900 --> 22:16.471
is less the ritual
and more that you consider

22:16.539 --> 22:18.475
Elias and his family

22:18.543 --> 22:20.480
and what they need.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.452
That would be
something new for you.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.625
And very, very good.

22:27.459 --> 22:30.601
We need to develop
your skills at empathy,

22:30.667 --> 22:34.307
which means putting yourself
in someone else's shoes.

22:34.374 --> 22:36.411
And the truth is...

22:36.478 --> 22:39.383
most people need
to work on this.

22:40.118 --> 22:41.789
But you, in particular,

22:41.856 --> 22:45.095
can benefit
from growing in this regard.

22:49.605 --> 22:51.842
Yeah, that sounds good.

22:54.313 --> 22:56.351
Yeah.

22:57.086 --> 23:00.125
I'll, uh, I'll leave the body
where it can be found.

23:01.629 --> 23:03.966
For the family.

23:07.006 --> 23:09.811
You're gonna have to help me
fill in that hole.

24:31.241 --> 24:33.980
Oh, shoot.

24:34.047 --> 24:36.150
Oh, no.

24:58.596 --> 25:01.167
Is something going on with you?

25:05.275 --> 25:07.547
It's been a lot, Sam.

25:09.985 --> 25:13.526
Thank you for asking.
I really appreciate it.

25:20.907 --> 25:22.710
Yeah.
