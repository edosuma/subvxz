WEBVTT

00:36.161 --> 00:38.163
I also had a dog.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.665
It was named Umul.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.793
It died in the Great Drought.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.296
What brings you here?

00:49.799 --> 00:52.385
It's not on the door. It's on the floor.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.055
Sorry?

00:56.389 --> 00:59.142
The sign for the data storage
at Balhae Station

00:59.976 --> 01:01.186
is on the floor.

02:39.325 --> 02:43.413
CAUSE OF DEATH

03:14.194 --> 03:15.153
<i>Dr. Song.</i>

03:22.327 --> 03:23.203
Yes?

03:24.287 --> 03:27.916
<i>Mr. Lee Gisu is not responding</i>
<i>to the radio.</i> <i>Are you with him?</i>

03:30.752 --> 03:33.880
He's on standby at the entrance, and I'm

03:34.547 --> 03:36.507
taking a look around the surrounding area.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.344
Oh, what about the biosignal?

03:40.178 --> 03:43.973
I'm searching the nearby area,
but it seems like there was an error.

03:55.443 --> 03:58.404
<i>I'll be returning shortly.</i>
<i>Join Mr. Lee immediately.</i>

03:59.364 --> 04:00.406
<i>Please do not</i>

04:01.741 --> 04:02.992
<i>act independently.</i>

04:03.701 --> 04:05.036
Okay. I'll go back.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.282
What?

04:43.199 --> 04:44.033
It's water?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.716
Team Two returning to command center.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.393
<i>Chief Gong, where are you?</i>

05:10.476 --> 05:13.896
It looks like an error on the machine.
I'm returning to the storage.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.273
Where's Dr. Song?

05:15.356 --> 05:17.692
<i>She left the area,</i>
<i>but she's returning now.</i>

05:21.738 --> 05:23.489
We're going to Storage Three.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.574
Yes, sir.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.748
Gisu.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.220
Damn it.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.797
Gisu.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.524
Gisu!

08:16.996 --> 08:17.830
Dr. Song.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.164
The immediate cause of his death
is a cervical spine fracture.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.666
He died on the spot.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.293
He has a fractured skull,
right arm, ankles…

09:05.419 --> 09:07.088
His entire body is damaged.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.218
Even if he fell from the ceiling,

09:13.302 --> 09:15.221
he couldn't have been injured this badly.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.849
It means he didn't simply die
from the fall.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.227
Do you believe what Dr. Song said?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.775
Well, in any case,

09:28.651 --> 09:29.944
the state of his body

09:30.820 --> 09:32.613
coincides with what she said.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.955
Soohyuk and I will take care of the rest.
Please return to the command center.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.374
Okay.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.543
Don't let your guard down on the way.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.628
Yes. I understand, Captain.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.958
Why was the co-pilot in the storage alone?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.629
Why didn't you report as you deviated?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.757
Are you interrogating me?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.592
Once communications are restored,

10:34.675 --> 10:38.471
I must report back on the reasons why
I lost two crew members in under an hour.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.349
So I need to know exactly what happened.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.737
I was just…

10:57.156 --> 10:58.949
looking around the area.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.452
It's my fault for not reporting. I'm--

11:01.535 --> 11:02.870
I don't need an excuse.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.123
I'll know once I check your bodycam.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.771
Forget the mission.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.067
We'll spend all our time moving the corpses.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.947
Back when I was a kid,
I'd look up to the moon and make wishes.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.158
But this is one hell of an eerie place.

11:43.035 --> 11:47.081
And what's going on with Dr. Song?
What is she trying to do?

11:47.164 --> 11:50.668
At first, she made us nervous
over their cause of death,

11:50.751 --> 11:52.420
then she roamed about on her own.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.798
Who does she think she is
to create such trouble?

11:55.881 --> 11:58.926
She wasn't trying to cause trouble.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.470
She just shared her opinion
as a scientist.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.807
I was talking to myself.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.100
And think about it.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.894
The least we can do
is work together as a whole.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.772
But she nitpicks over everything
and keeps bringing us down.

12:11.856 --> 12:12.857
Tell me about it.

12:13.691 --> 12:17.361
Who could've known that there wouldn't be
any intact samples left in the storages?

12:18.696 --> 12:21.574
Our captain isn't the type
who'd give up like this.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.660
We'll end up searching
through the entire station.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.833
SONG JIAN

12:41.135 --> 12:42.094
<i>Gisu.</i>

12:45.931 --> 12:47.183
Did you see that?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.560
He was dragged in by something.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.364
<i>Gisu!</i>

13:04.158 --> 13:06.035
Wait, right here. Now.

13:08.662 --> 13:09.914
Isn't that a sample?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.666
The capsule is intact.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.671
It looks like it was kept
in some kind of solution.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.424
Wait.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.616
This is Balhae Station. Control, respond.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.826
This is Balhae Station.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.208
Our comms got smashed,
and the station's won't work.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.668
What now? What do we do?

13:55.751 --> 13:59.672
I don't think there's a problem
with the internal system.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.925
There might be a problem
with the radio tower outside.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.427
They would still send
a rescue ship, right?

14:05.511 --> 14:06.804
Of course they will.

14:06.887 --> 14:10.099
I'm sure they're trying
to come up with a measure.

14:11.809 --> 14:12.643
Goodness.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.568
Look at that punk. He's asleep.

14:23.070 --> 14:23.904
Soochan.

14:25.030 --> 14:25.990
Are you asleep?

14:26.907 --> 14:28.826
Man, I can't believe you can…

14:29.869 --> 14:30.744
Hey.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.205
What's wrong with you?

14:34.081 --> 14:36.584
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

14:36.667 --> 14:38.711
Are you sick? Hey.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.071
What could it be?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.781
It didn't seem human, sir.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.661
But it took the sample.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.707
If that creature was
aware of the sample's value,

15:17.499 --> 15:19.543
it's most likely human.

15:24.632 --> 15:29.428
Then it could be an intruder,
like that dead mercenary at the gate.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.847
We'll catch it and find out.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.645
It's curved at the end.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.742
The passage seems to continue.
Should we go after it right away?

15:51.825 --> 15:53.369
It couldn't have gone far.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.538
<i>Captain, where are you?</i>

15:56.622 --> 15:59.166
<i>It's Soochan. Soochan just collapsed!</i>

16:24.024 --> 16:24.900
What now?

16:27.277 --> 16:28.946
Doc Hong, where are you?

16:30.197 --> 16:31.740
I'm almost there!

16:31.824 --> 16:33.617
Do not come into contact with him!

16:33.701 --> 16:35.285
Put on hazmat suits and wait!

16:57.057 --> 16:58.767
What's taking her so long?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.020
Don't worry, Soochan. She'll be here soon.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.648
-Get out! Get out of here, all of you!
-Doc Hong.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.317
-Stay outside. Get out.
-What's happening?

17:07.401 --> 17:09.069
-Let's go.
-Damn it.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.665
What's happening to him?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.083
-Captain.
-What happened?

19:04.935 --> 19:05.853
Soochan.

19:08.021 --> 19:08.856
Soochan.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.316
Soochan, hang in there.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.368
-You can't go in.
-No, let go.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.621
One second. Will you let me go?

19:27.082 --> 19:28.959
Soochan! Hang in there.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.254
Gong Soochan. Hang in there.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.339
Soochan, hang in there.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.346
Please hang in there.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.519
Hang in there.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.861
Soochan, stay with me.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.446
Gong Soochan!

20:07.539 --> 20:08.707
Gong Soochan!

20:09.208 --> 20:10.959
Stay with me, Soochan!

20:25.182 --> 20:26.391
Gong Soochan!

20:30.270 --> 20:31.563
Doc Hong.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.689
Doc Hong.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.483
What's going on?

20:35.776 --> 20:36.735
Soochan.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.740
Wake up, Soochan.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.618
Soochan!

20:44.701 --> 20:46.495
Wake up, Soochan!

21:03.553 --> 21:05.764
<i>Air purification system activated.</i>

21:27.035 --> 21:27.869
Doc Hong.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.581
Have you seen anything like this?

21:32.165 --> 21:34.293
I've never seen anything like this before.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.504
At this point…

21:39.798 --> 21:41.800
we have to keep him quarantined

21:42.592 --> 21:45.971
until we find the exact cause of death.
It's too dangerous for the others.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.766
We should move him
to the main lab infirmary,

21:50.350 --> 21:52.728
and I'll have to do an autopsy right away.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.984
Should I talk to Chief Gong?

22:00.610 --> 22:01.778
I'll talk to him.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.495
<i>Air purification complete.</i>

22:36.438 --> 22:37.522
I'm sorry.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.863
We have to do an autopsy
to find out the exact cause…

23:07.886 --> 23:09.096
Dr. Hong.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.306
Yes?

23:11.390 --> 23:16.144
If there's a way to find out everything
that happened here, what would you do?

23:18.605 --> 23:19.689
What do you mean?

23:22.067 --> 23:23.276
There's a data storage…

23:25.237 --> 23:26.905
somewhere in this station.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.413
How long will it take?

23:34.913 --> 23:37.833
The autopsy itself
will take one to two hours.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.045
But it'll take me quite a while
to find the exact cause of death.

23:42.546 --> 23:46.091
I'd like to inspect
the medical records and the other bodies.

23:46.925 --> 23:47.926
And?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.137
Do you need anything else?

23:50.220 --> 23:53.682
No, I just need your permission
to conduct an investigation.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.725
I thought you didn't need my permission.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.228
You've been doing as you like.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.400
Don't you get it by now?

24:04.693 --> 24:07.988
How can we get answers
if we don't ask any questions?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.258
I know this is tough.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.802
But our mission stands the same

24:31.386 --> 24:33.054
until we reconnect with Earth.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.183
Captain… can we call it quits?

24:37.100 --> 24:40.645
We don't know why he died
or what killed him.

24:42.981 --> 24:46.359
The intruder got away
through ventilation shaft INP-07.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.070
It passes through
all key facilities of this station.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.825
Soohyuk and E2,
you'll search the shaft with me.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.995
Taesuk and Sun,
get us reconnected at any cost.

24:57.078 --> 25:01.249
We'll either call for backup
or halt the operation after that.

25:01.875 --> 25:02.959
Yes, Captain.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.767
It has to be tough on the captain too.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.562
But for now,

25:23.396 --> 25:25.857
we have no other choice
but to do our jobs.

26:43.518 --> 26:46.104
I have to take a look at the mainboard.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.689
Comms are still down.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.489
Is that made from a real meteorite?

26:58.617 --> 27:00.160
They look like rocks, right?

27:00.785 --> 27:02.037
But these are real.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.083
It's like a superstition.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.794
Meteorites fall on Earth,

27:10.378 --> 27:11.630
but they're fine.

27:12.881 --> 27:16.051
So we wear this to bid for our survival
no matter where we crash-land.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.970
It's a form of prayer
to the deity of the universe.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.892
I got this with Soochan,

27:24.851 --> 27:26.144
but only I survived.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.854
Why couldn't we both live?

27:28.438 --> 27:30.607
Why would you believe such a thing?

27:32.108 --> 27:33.860
-What?
-Think about it.

27:34.736 --> 27:38.365
If you die, you die.
If you live, you live.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.408
There's no such thing as a deity.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.873
The machine room is the closest.

27:46.956 --> 27:49.209
The west wing of the dorm
is down the hall.

27:50.543 --> 27:52.837
I'll take the lead.
E2, you watch our backs.

27:52.921 --> 27:53.922
Yes, sir.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.208
There are logs up until
right before the accident,

28:30.291 --> 28:32.335
but I don't see any particular leads.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.213
In that case,

28:35.839 --> 28:38.883
don't you think they really died
of a radiation leak?

28:52.981 --> 28:55.442
SONG WONKYUNG, LEVEL 1

28:58.194 --> 28:59.404
SONG WONKYUNG, LEVEL 1

29:05.702 --> 29:07.495
Oh, I can't watch this.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.875
Have you found anything?

29:13.293 --> 29:16.296
Some files are locked.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.381
I see.

29:18.465 --> 29:21.301
You probably can't look up
the records of the higher-ups.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.427
I guess not.

29:27.974 --> 29:30.935
Showing the same symptoms,
all on the same day…

29:32.479 --> 29:33.980
It progresses rapidly

29:34.564 --> 29:36.149
and has high fatality.

29:43.072 --> 29:46.951
We need to secure tissue samples
from other bodies as much as we can.

29:47.494 --> 29:51.080
And I'll trace back to when
Soochan's symptoms broke out.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.501
You're going to check the bodies?

29:56.628 --> 29:59.339
I can go alone.
You can stay here with Dr. Hong.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.804
No, you cannot move independently.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.013
I'll come with you.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.817
Would it be okay
if we left you alone for a moment?

30:19.400 --> 30:20.401
Sure.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.611
I'll see you later.

31:16.749 --> 31:17.876
Captain.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.226
Captain.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.854
A biosignal is approaching us
from the front.

31:42.817 --> 31:43.860
Are you sure?

31:45.153 --> 31:47.363
Yes, it's right ahead of us.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.289
It just passed by.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.758
It's moving back forward!

32:09.302 --> 32:10.845
Left. To the left, sir.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.905
He didn't look well.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.573
He was sweating profusely

32:31.115 --> 32:32.575
and he kept falling behind.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.745
<i>He'd space out and stare at the wall.</i>

32:37.413 --> 32:39.499
<i>Come to think of it, it was a bit odd.</i>

32:41.125 --> 32:42.126
Wait.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.421
I think I came in contact with him too.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.925
This isn't contagious or anything, is it?

32:49.926 --> 32:52.261
<i>Dr. Song, I need you here for a second.</i>

32:54.097 --> 32:56.516
Why? I'm still collecting samples.

32:56.599 --> 32:59.519
<i>-It won't take long.</i>
-I'll be there right away.

33:00.019 --> 33:03.398
<i>I don't need you.</i>
<i>I just need Dr. Song here for a moment.</i>

33:03.481 --> 33:05.400
<i>You can stay and collect samples.</i>

33:05.483 --> 33:08.069
Well, I don't have much to do here, so--

33:08.152 --> 33:09.278
I'll be back soon.

33:10.113 --> 33:10.947
Dr. Song.

33:15.284 --> 33:16.828
Make it quick!

35:01.390 --> 35:02.683
Dr. Song.

35:06.729 --> 35:08.106
What was it about this time?

35:08.606 --> 35:09.607
It's nothing.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.067
Let's go.

35:11.776 --> 35:15.446
Anyway, Dr. Song.
This really isn't contagious, right?

35:15.530 --> 35:17.448
I suddenly feel itchy all over.

35:26.791 --> 35:27.834
What's in here?

35:27.917 --> 35:30.878
There are no indicators
for Level One facilities.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.423
It's located right next
to the machine room.

35:37.969 --> 35:38.845
<i>Captain.</i>

35:40.847 --> 35:41.889
Are comms back up?

35:43.182 --> 35:46.561
<i>I found a way to fix it,</i>
<i>but things don't look too good.</i>

35:48.354 --> 35:49.313
Okay.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.608
Let's head back to the command center.

35:52.692 --> 35:53.985
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.534
I'm sure everyone here

36:02.326 --> 36:04.954
came down with some kind of sickness.

36:05.746 --> 36:08.916
How else would they have
ended up like this overnight?

37:06.891 --> 37:08.267
Thank you, Dr. Hong.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.772
I figured we should look
into as many things as we can.

37:16.359 --> 37:20.154
Anyway, the result came out as I expected.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.741
I found mucus foam
around the airway and bronchial tubes.

37:23.824 --> 37:27.995
And there were signs of water
seeping through his internal organs.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.248
That means his body was filled with water.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.207
Then,

37:31.999 --> 37:33.501
he did drown to death.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.461
Yes.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.047
There's no sign of external damage.

37:38.130 --> 37:41.884
That means the water rose up
from the inside,

37:42.551 --> 37:46.013
and it happened so quickly
that his bronchial tubes are swollen.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.475
Other bodies shared similar symptoms.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.646
I've never seen anything like this.

37:54.772 --> 37:58.317
Where did that much water come from?
Have you ever seen anything like this?

38:18.838 --> 38:20.089
There's nothing.

38:22.591 --> 38:24.135
What's not there?

38:24.719 --> 38:26.387
Nothing is out of the ordinary.

38:28.014 --> 38:30.933
There are no infectious particles
such as viruses or bacteria,

38:31.017 --> 38:33.477
or toxins related to organ damage.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.522
The crew members were all in good health.

38:48.993 --> 38:49.994
Look at this.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.496
This is Soochan's blood.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.751
There's another layer.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.837
In the blood? What is this?

39:04.216 --> 39:07.720
There's a problem with the digital unit
connected to the communications tower.

39:09.388 --> 39:11.640
We need someone outside
to switch the equipment

39:11.724 --> 39:13.768
while another edits the protocol inside.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.102
Then we reboot the system.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.063
But I'm the only engineer here,

39:17.146 --> 39:19.273
so I can't cover both ends at once.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.361
Is this the digital unit?

39:23.444 --> 39:25.446
Yes. But there's a problem.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.824
While the station was up,
you could just use the elevator

39:28.908 --> 39:32.536
to the common wing of the building,
but it's currently out of order.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.915
The station was neglected
for five years after the accident,

39:35.998 --> 39:37.625
so there seem to be some problems.

39:37.708 --> 39:41.003
The only way to get there
is to go out to the gate,

39:41.087 --> 39:44.673
grab the elevator rail outside,
then climb down. But that's--

39:44.757 --> 39:47.009
We can set up an anchor and get down.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.888
It won't be hard.

39:50.971 --> 39:51.972
No, you can't.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.266
It's better to wait
until the rescue ship comes.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.185
-It's way too dangerous.
-I'll do it.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.191
Tell me what I need to do
when I get there.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.776
Will you be all right?

40:06.070 --> 40:08.197
I have to reach Director Choi
as soon as I can.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.519
Did you find the cause?

40:38.602 --> 40:41.689
We're analyzing the substance
we found in Soochan's blood.

40:43.732 --> 40:44.775
Once comms are up,

40:44.859 --> 40:48.237
I'll make a request to Director Choi
for a reinvestigation of the accident.

40:49.822 --> 40:52.074
Only if we can find samples
and have enough time.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.995
And to do that, it's important
to find out why Soochan died.

40:56.871 --> 40:57.830
Understood.

40:59.248 --> 41:00.124
Captain.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.376
Are you really going out there?

41:03.335 --> 41:04.253
Yes.

41:08.924 --> 41:09.967
Wait.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.183
There's something that concerns me.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.270
It's the intruder.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.356
It didn't try to hurt me.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.234
How can you be sure of that?

41:27.318 --> 41:29.403
There's something called
critical distance.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.240
<i>When animals find intruders</i>
<i>in their territory,</i>

41:33.324 --> 41:34.825
<i>they watch them first.</i>

41:35.534 --> 41:38.787
Then they attack the intruder
when they come within a certain distance.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.583
That's why it's very important
to keep an appropriate distance.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.920
On top of that,
it moves by using the shafts,

41:46.003 --> 41:49.048
and it always manages to escape
because it's always a step ahead.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.133
It seems like it's familiar

41:51.800 --> 41:53.427
with the internal structure.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.846
Do you think it could be a survivor?

42:00.392 --> 42:03.145
The government would have known
if there had been a survivor.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.524
Above all, it has been over five years.

42:06.607 --> 42:08.526
How could there be a survivor?

42:08.609 --> 42:10.528
It's not completely impossible.

42:11.153 --> 42:14.031
The radiation level in here
turned out to be normal,

42:14.657 --> 42:17.034
so if they rationed food and water,

42:17.576 --> 42:19.328
there could well be a survivor.

42:19.411 --> 42:22.289
Then why haven't they
informed us to this day?

42:23.249 --> 42:26.293
And if it wasn't an intruder,
there's no reason to steal the sample.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.920
If it really was a survivor,

42:29.255 --> 42:31.507
they should be welcoming us
instead of attacking.
