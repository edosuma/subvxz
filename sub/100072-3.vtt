00:40.415 --> 00:42.166
Ha! Isn't this exciting?

00:42.167 --> 00:44.334
Yeah, but I don't like
little Kyle Kaepernick

00:44.335 --> 00:46.086
kneeling during
the national anthem.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.422

00:48.423 --> 00:50.883
Boo! Get on your feet!

00:50.884 --> 00:53.177
Boo! Down in front.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.638
Okay, need to stay focused.

It's the same thing Ryan Lochte

01:08.818 --> 01:10.944
Stewie, you're taking this
way too seriously.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.822
It's a meaningless event,
like a bar mitzvah.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.407
Today you are a man.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.284
- Great. Can I drive?
- No.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.619
- Can I vote?
- No.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.745

01:19.746 --> 01:21.163

(indistinct chatter)

01:38.056 --> 01:40.015
Lois, why'd we got to come here?

01:40.016 --> 01:42.017
This place is a bunch
of rich snobs.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.394
We have lunch with my parents
twice a year.

01:44.395 --> 01:45.562
Consider yourself lucky.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.105
Under normal circumstances,

01:47.106 --> 01:49.233
you'd never be allowed
in a place like this.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.068
Griffin, come on.
They're waiting for your order.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.445
Sorry. Do you have oysters?

01:53.446 --> 01:55.823
- We do not.
- Aw, shucks.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.408
(laughter)

01:59.160 --> 02:01.203
Damn it, Griffin,
you've been staring at that menu

02:01.204 --> 02:03.163
for five minutes,
and you peed your pants.

02:03.164 --> 02:06.333
Um, do you have oysters?

02:06.334 --> 02:08.544
Get up.
They have to clean the chair.

02:12.924 --> 02:16.510
Hey, Brian, you don't have
a metal detector on you, do you?

02:16.511 --> 02:18.846
Okay, Stewie, you got a medal.
Way to go.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.597
Do I sense a hint of jealousy?

02:20.598 --> 02:22.099
Stewie, didn't it strike you
as odd

02:22.100 --> 02:23.934
that everyone got a medal?

02:23.935 --> 02:26.353
You didn't win anything.
It's a participant medal.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.397
They give 'em to every kid
with a pulse.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.774
And like every other medal
or award you've ever gotten,

02:30.775 --> 02:32.484
it means nothing.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.195
What?

02:37.490 --> 02:39.241
(gasps)

02:39.242 --> 02:41.201
Stewie, I-I'm sorry.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.329
I-I shouldn't have said that.
I lost my temper.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.458
- (sobbing)
- Slow down!

02:54.090 --> 02:56.134
(gasps)

02:58.428 --> 03:00.470
No, no, no, no, no.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.097
How could I be such a fool?

03:02.098 --> 03:04.350
This is a wall of lies.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.060
And that's a hole of lies.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.439
Everything I've ever won
is worthless!

03:12.400 --> 03:13.484
Aah!

03:15.653 --> 03:18.072
You won't make a fool of me
any longer.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.202
Oh, no!
It's all right, Stewie.

03:24.203 --> 03:27.205
Stay calm. This is why
we have a house fire captain.

03:27.206 --> 03:30.375
Okay, when I read your name,
please respond with a "here."

03:30.376 --> 03:32.878
- Griffin, Mac.
- It's Meg.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.004
Sorry, it looks like "Mac."

03:34.005 --> 03:36.882
- Griffin, Liam.
- It's Lois.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.469
Again, please respond
with "here."

03:43.139 --> 03:46.600
Oh, my God,
Chris is still in there!

03:46.601 --> 03:48.477
Somebody save Chris!

03:48.478 --> 03:50.897
(bystanders gasping)

03:52.899 --> 03:54.692
(cheering)

03:59.030 --> 04:01.741

He's earned that.

God, look at this place.

04:15.404 --> 04:17.279
Our whole house is destroyed.

04:17.281 --> 04:19.072
Oh, here comes
the insurance guy.

04:19.074 --> 04:21.951
Everyone start crying about
losing your new golf clubs

04:21.952 --> 04:23.661
and Grant Wood's
American Gothic.

04:23.662 --> 04:25.121
Oh...

04:25.122 --> 04:29.083
my new golf clubs
with the titanium shafts.

04:29.084 --> 04:32.587
Oh, my classic depiction
of the austere steadfastness

04:32.588 --> 04:34.380
of rural America!

04:34.381 --> 04:36.382
You know, I don't care.
It's not my money.

04:36.383 --> 04:37.759
Oh.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.469
Peter, I spoke with my parents,

04:39.470 --> 04:41.804
and we can live with them
until our house is fixed.

04:41.805 --> 04:44.432
Great. It's gonna suck worse
than Mueslix.

04:44.433 --> 04:46.601
You know,
the German health cereal?

04:46.602 --> 04:48.436
Guten Morgen. Try me.

04:48.437 --> 04:50.605
I am made of oats and fiber.

04:50.606 --> 04:51.981
Okay. Sounds healthy.

04:51.982 --> 04:53.733
Ja. Also, I am German

04:53.734 --> 04:55.693
and wouldn't mind
watching you crap.

04:55.694 --> 04:57.570
- Uh, I don't know.
- Come, come.

04:57.571 --> 04:59.947
It will be mine
and yours little secret.

04:59.948 --> 05:02.658
Just the two of us.
Please, take me home.

05:02.659 --> 05:04.702
Uh, okay. But just you.

05:04.703 --> 05:07.246
I don't feel safe now.

05:07.247 --> 05:09.665
Stop talking!
Concentrate on the pooping!

05:09.666 --> 05:12.418
ANNOUNCER:
Mueslix,
the weird European cereal

05:12.419 --> 05:14.505
that likes to watch you poop.

05:19.343 --> 05:20.968
(doorbell rings)

05:20.969 --> 05:23.805
Aw, why we got to stay
with your parents?

05:23.806 --> 05:25.431
You know,
sometimes I get the feeling

05:25.432 --> 05:26.850
they don't respect me.

05:29.853 --> 05:32.189
(grunting)

05:46.453 --> 05:47.829
(brakes hiss)

05:47.830 --> 05:50.249
(whirring)

05:57.005 --> 05:59.257
Thank you
for not interrupting my bit.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.592
Come on in.

06:02.177 --> 06:04.220
Wow, check out this media room.

06:04.221 --> 06:06.222
Maybe you burning down the house
wasn't so bad.

06:06.223 --> 06:08.002
My actions were justified.

06:08.009 --> 06:10.135
I'd been fed
a massive societal lie

06:10.136 --> 06:13.348
in the form
of participant awards.

06:15.684 --> 06:19.436
Hey, kids, how would you like
to hear this on the screen

06:19.437 --> 06:21.939
instead of the great show
you came to see?

06:21.940 --> 06:24.400
(children cheering)

06:24.401 --> 06:27.152
That's what you sound like.
Honest.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.196
Please cooperate
and do your part

06:29.197 --> 06:31.573
in keeping this theater quiet,
so everyone,

06:31.574 --> 06:33.992
including you,
can enjoy it.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.453
Remember, lots of adults
and kids, too,

06:36.454 --> 06:38.539
paid admission
to enjoy the show.

06:38.540 --> 06:42.626
We must insist
on absolute quiet.

06:42.627 --> 06:45.045
Otherwise, we will be forced
to evict

06:45.046 --> 06:47.673
all disturbance makers
from the theater.

06:47.674 --> 06:51.593
Those asked to leave today
will be refused admission

06:51.594 --> 06:53.137
to this theater in the future.

06:53.138 --> 06:54.721
Thank you.

06:54.722 --> 06:56.515
Wow, what a dick.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.891
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

06:57.892 --> 06:59.601
I've deleted all my old tweets,

06:59.602 --> 07:01.770
so don't even bother looking
for bad stuff.

07:01.771 --> 07:03.480
Screen grabs can be faked.

07:03.481 --> 07:05.232
But, first,
it's that time of year again

07:05.233 --> 07:07.443
for the annual
Quahog Pie Cook-off.

07:07.444 --> 07:11.280
The winner will take home
the coveted Pie Champ trophy.

07:11.281 --> 07:13.365
Brian, this could be
my chance to finally win

07:13.366 --> 07:14.908
a legitimate award.

07:14.909 --> 07:16.452
- You think you're up to it?
- Of course.

07:16.453 --> 07:17.995
I just have to apply myself.

07:17.996 --> 07:20.205
Like Chris, when he worked
at that casino.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.957
No more bets. The money that
could have gone to your kids

07:21.958 --> 07:24.001
is gone.
No more bets.

07:24.002 --> 07:25.919
The money you worked hard for
is gone.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.630
Fools, fools, fools.

07:28.631 --> 07:29.756
Ooh, double zero.

07:29.757 --> 07:31.508
Nobody thinks about that one.

07:31.509 --> 07:34.052
And guy walks quickly away
from table without a word,

07:34.053 --> 07:36.680
replaced by an older white man
with a much younger black woman.

07:36.681 --> 07:38.641
No more bets. No more bets.

07:41.603 --> 07:45.355
Brian, are you ready
for my grand creation?

07:45.356 --> 07:47.858
- Serve it up, bitch.
- Well, that was uncalled for.

07:47.859 --> 07:50.320
But get ready to be wowed.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.696
(crunch)

07:52.697 --> 07:54.698
What the-- This is mud.

07:54.699 --> 07:56.074
Yes. It's a mud pie.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.993
I used Legos for the fruit.

07:57.994 --> 08:00.120
Stewie, you can't submit this.
It's inedible.

08:00.121 --> 08:01.872
Okay, now I know
you're full of crap,

08:01.873 --> 08:04.249
because everyone else
loves it.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.252
Mmm, num-num-num-num-nah.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.505
So delicious, Stewie.

08:09.506 --> 08:11.174
Best pie ever.

08:12.884 --> 08:15.969
Wow! Tastes great, Stewie.

08:15.970 --> 08:18.764
Mmm, so good.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.432
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.559
Not so hammy, Meg.
He's not an idiot.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.311
Stewie, can't you see
they're faking it

08:24.312 --> 08:25.395
to make you feel good?

08:25.396 --> 08:27.356
What are you talking about?

08:27.357 --> 08:29.608
(slo-mo):
Wow!

08:29.609 --> 08:33.486
Mmm. Num-num-num-num-nah.

08:33.488 --> 08:37.157
So good.

08:37.158 --> 08:40.994
We must insist
on absolute quiet.

08:40.995 --> 08:43.664
My God, you're right.

08:43.664 --> 08:46.416
They're all just lying
to protect my feelings.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.502
This pie is garbage!

08:48.503 --> 08:50.712
And the contest is next week.
I have to drop out.

08:50.713 --> 08:52.965
No, you don't.
You just got to do the work.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.508
Stewie, you're a smart kid.

08:54.509 --> 08:57.344
I know you can bake a pie,
and I'll help you.

08:57.345 --> 08:59.471
You will?
Thank you, Brian.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.099
This calls for champagne.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.059
Pop.

09:04.060 --> 09:06.562
Glug, glug, glug.

09:06.563 --> 09:08.397
Bottoms up.

09:08.398 --> 09:10.315
Go with it.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.817
Ugh. Korbel?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.694
- It's not Korbel. It's...
- Go with it.

09:13.695 --> 09:15.946
Yes, I had some left over
from Denise's wedding.

09:15.947 --> 09:17.990
- Who's Denise?
- Go with it.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.450
Fine. How is Denise?
Did she have the abortion?

09:20.451 --> 09:22.286
- Abortion?
- Go with it.

09:22.287 --> 09:25.205
No, her alarm didn't go off,
so she missed it.

09:25.206 --> 09:27.207
So, Brian,
is this your first orgy?

09:27.208 --> 09:28.668
Not going with it.

09:34.299 --> 09:36.466
Peter, would you like to join us
in a parlor game?

09:36.467 --> 09:38.302
Parlor game?

09:38.303 --> 09:39.678
Lois, why do you always
start talking like a snob

09:39.679 --> 09:41.138
when you're around
your parents?

09:41.139 --> 09:43.307
What? It's the way
I was brought up.

09:43.308 --> 09:45.267
I know, let's play
"The Minister's Cat."

09:45.268 --> 09:46.977
I don't know what that is.

09:46.978 --> 09:49.272
It's simple.
In alphabetical order. Go.

09:51.399 --> 09:53.192
The minister's cat is
an affable cat.

09:54.986 --> 09:56.862
The minister's cat is
a boisterous cat.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.572
Penrose!

09:58.573 --> 10:00.366
The minister's cat is
a covetous cat.

10:01.409 --> 10:04.828
The minister's cat is
a devious cat.

10:04.829 --> 10:06.872
The minister's cat's
an eclectic cat.

10:06.873 --> 10:07.998
Peter, your turn. Go.

10:07.999 --> 10:09.458
- Wh-What?
- Peter, hurry.

10:09.459 --> 10:11.084
I don't-- I don't know this cat.

10:11.085 --> 10:13.253
Damn it, Peter,
you ruined the game!

10:13.254 --> 10:16.423
Peter, perhaps the word
you were looking for is...

10:16.424 --> 10:17.924
"forgotten."

10:40.323 --> 10:42.450
(crickets chirping)

10:44.494 --> 10:46.954
(sighs):
Finally, a place to escape.

10:51.876 --> 10:53.168
Oh, hey, Babs.

10:53.169 --> 10:55.837
Hello, Peter.
What brings you out here?

10:55.838 --> 10:57.923
I had to get away
from that stupid game.

10:57.924 --> 11:01.551
I don't know, whenever I'm here,
I feel out of place.

11:01.552 --> 11:04.639
It's just a different world
than I'm used to.

11:08.393 --> 11:09.935
(belches)

11:09.936 --> 11:12.145
Bring that up again,
and we'll vote on it.

11:12.146 --> 11:14.314
Whoa, where'd you learn
a line like that?

11:14.315 --> 11:16.983
Oh, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

11:16.984 --> 11:20.070
You know, Peter,
you and I are not so different.

11:20.071 --> 11:21.822
You struggle
to get erections, too?

11:21.823 --> 11:25.617
You may think I've always been a
part of this high-society world,

11:25.618 --> 11:28.870
but I wasn't born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

11:28.871 --> 11:31.248
Well, that probably would've
torn your mom's uterus.

11:31.249 --> 11:34.543
My point is, I'm not from
an upper-crust world, either.

11:34.544 --> 11:37.129
I just had to act that way
to impress Carter,

11:37.130 --> 11:38.880
who cared about that stuff.

11:38.881 --> 11:41.216
I was struggling
to be something I wasn't.

11:41.217 --> 11:43.427
In many ways, I still am.

11:43.428 --> 11:45.220
There's an Ed Sheeran song

11:45.221 --> 11:47.139
for every emotion
you're feeling right now.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.099
Ooh, no, thank you.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.517
You know,
I like hanging out with you.

11:50.518 --> 11:52.269
Hey, what do you say
we ditch this stuffy place

11:52.270 --> 11:54.896
- and head to the Clam?
- The Drunken Clam?

11:54.897 --> 11:57.482
Why, I haven't been there
in decades.

11:57.483 --> 11:58.900
I'd love to.

11:58.901 --> 12:00.652
- To the Babsmobile!
- (alarm chirps)

12:00.653 --> 12:03.739
("Batman Theme" playing)

12:03.740 --> 12:06.032
You got vehicles
with your face on 'em, too?

12:06.033 --> 12:07.868
You know it, stinky.

12:07.869 --> 12:10.788
Oh, I didn't like
being called stinky.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.502
(tires screech)

12:18.796 --> 12:20.422
Babs, I got to hand it to you.

12:20.423 --> 12:22.716
You turned a crappy night
into something great.

12:22.717 --> 12:24.092
You know, I've never dropped
bowling balls

12:24.093 --> 12:26.636
from an overpass before.
They fall quick.

12:26.637 --> 12:29.890
That was the most fun
I've had in decades.

12:29.891 --> 12:33.185
It felt good to reconnect
with the girl I once was.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.353
Hey, listen, you got
to stay true to that girl.

12:35.354 --> 12:38.106
She's an amazing person.
A real person.

12:38.107 --> 12:40.233
Not some stuffy Newport snob.

12:40.234 --> 12:43.528
Oh, sometimes I feel trapped
in this world,

12:43.529 --> 12:46.948
forever trying to live up
to everyone else's expectations,

12:46.949 --> 12:48.700
especially Carter's.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.952
Sounds like you've wasted
your entire life.

12:50.953 --> 12:52.954
Thank you, Peter.

12:52.955 --> 12:56.166
You've helped me
more than you know. Mwah.

12:56.167 --> 12:58.044
Yuck.

13:02.089 --> 13:03.924
Well, Brian,
I've studied pie-making,

13:03.925 --> 13:06.968
and the key is to find the
absolute freshest ingredients.

13:06.969 --> 13:10.305
Therefore, we must go wherever
and whenever

13:10.306 --> 13:12.558
they're to be found.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.817
- Where are we?
- 1666, England.

13:21.818 --> 13:23.610
Home of Sir Isaac Newton

13:23.611 --> 13:25.905
and one of history's
most famous apples.

13:28.449 --> 13:30.284
Which will be part of our pie.

13:33.621 --> 13:36.541
(shouts)
Gravity never happened!

13:40.044 --> 13:41.711
Good morning, family.

13:41.712 --> 13:44.297
And before anyone asks,
I brought this owl from home.

13:44.298 --> 13:46.758
I did not take it
from the enclosed owlery.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.678
Just want to make that clear.
Home-brought owl.

13:49.679 --> 13:52.264
Peter, what did the two of you
talk about last night?

13:52.265 --> 13:53.765
- (hoots)
- Yeah, who?

13:53.766 --> 13:56.309
You can see why I stole this
from the owlery--

13:56.310 --> 13:57.727
I-I mean brought it from home.
Damn it!

13:57.728 --> 14:00.438
My mother.
After your night together,

14:00.439 --> 14:01.940
she told Daddy
she's leaving him.

14:01.941 --> 14:03.733
- (hoots)
- Yeah, who?

14:03.734 --> 14:05.569
All right, I'm already getting
tired of this owl.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.487
I'm gonna go put him back
in the owlery.

14:07.488 --> 14:10.032
Peter, enough.
You've got to make this right.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.372
Now, that one seemed
less earned.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.128
(seabirds calling)

14:29.635 --> 14:30.595
(tires screech)

14:32.221 --> 14:34.222
Babs, I've been looking
all over for you.

14:34.223 --> 14:37.225
- What are you doing here?
- This is my hometown, Peter.

14:37.226 --> 14:38.643
It's where I grew up.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.604
In fact, as a rebellious teen,

14:40.605 --> 14:42.939
I used to come down
to this boardwalk

14:42.940 --> 14:46.568
and feed Alka-Seltzer tablets
to the seagulls.

14:46.569 --> 14:48.236
(squawking)

14:48.237 --> 14:51.031
Babs, you got to come home.
Carter needs you.

14:51.032 --> 14:53.700
I'm sorry,
but I-I can't do that right now.

14:53.701 --> 14:55.368
(seagull shrieks, pops)

14:55.369 --> 14:58.622
Peter, you've been able
to stay true to who you were.

14:58.623 --> 15:01.041
- I've lost touch with that.
- (seagull shrieks, pops)

15:01.042 --> 15:04.544
It's been buried
by Carter and his money.

15:04.545 --> 15:07.047
I want to find it again.

15:07.048 --> 15:09.925
Listen, Babs, I understand
what you're doing. I really do.

15:09.926 --> 15:11.885
Sometimes I feel suffocated
by Lois

15:11.886 --> 15:14.721
and my stupid mother-in-law,
but you got to come home.

15:14.722 --> 15:17.599
- (seagull shrieks, pops)
- I don't think so, Peter.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.267
You and Carter are meant
for each other.

15:19.268 --> 15:20.727
You go together.

15:20.728 --> 15:22.979
L-Like the couple
from the movie Grease.

15:22.980 --> 15:27.067
Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama-Ka-Dinga-
Da-Dinga-Dong, do you take

15:27.068 --> 15:29.903
Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda-
Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom

15:29.904 --> 15:31.905
- to be your wife?
- I do.

15:31.906 --> 15:35.533
And Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda-
Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom,

15:35.534 --> 15:39.537
do you take Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama-
Ka-Dinga-Da-Dinga-Dong

15:39.538 --> 15:41.873
- to be your husband?
- I do.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.416
If anyone objects
to this union,

15:43.417 --> 15:46.378
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

15:46.379 --> 15:50.216
-(all gasping)
-Mr. Chang-Chang-Changity-
Chang-Sha-Bop!

15:55.304 --> 15:57.097
Peter, where have you been?

15:57.098 --> 15:59.849
Listen, Carter, unless you want
to lose Babs forever,

15:59.850 --> 16:01.351
you better get down
to Weekapaug.

16:01.352 --> 16:02.644
Why the hell would I do that?

16:02.645 --> 16:04.312
If you want to win her back,

16:04.313 --> 16:06.940
maybe, for once,
you try to fit into her world.

16:06.941 --> 16:08.817
You got to become a regular guy.

16:08.818 --> 16:11.069
What? No! Never!

16:11.070 --> 16:15.198
Daddy, Peter's right.
You got to do this for Mom.

16:15.199 --> 16:18.576
All right, fine. I'll take
a quick choke-myself-awake nap

16:18.577 --> 16:20.245
and be ready to go.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.206
(snoring)

16:26.210 --> 16:28.962
(choking)

16:28.963 --> 16:31.716
(clears throat)
All right. All right, let's go.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.266
- I'm so nervous.
- You made a damn good pie,
Stewie.

16:41.267 --> 16:44.019
You should be proud of yourself,
whatever happens.

16:44.020 --> 16:48.440
Good afternoon, Quahog,
I'm Tom Tucker... in a T-shirt?

16:48.441 --> 16:50.608
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

16:50.609 --> 16:54.195
This year's Quahog
pie-baking champion is...

16:54.196 --> 16:56.364
Fjurg Vanderploeg.

16:56.365 --> 16:57.532
(cheering and applause)

16:57.533 --> 17:00.535
Everyone is welcome
to taste my pie.

17:00.536 --> 17:02.954
Sorry, Stewie.
You did your best.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.873
These were old pros.

17:04.874 --> 17:06.250
But, hey, look. You took fifth.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.836
Fifth? Is that good?

17:09.837 --> 17:12.005
- Do I get a medal?
- You get a ribbon.

17:12.006 --> 17:14.174
Does everyone who participates
get a ribbon?

17:14.175 --> 17:15.884
Only ten out of 14.

17:15.885 --> 17:18.470
My God. I did it.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.555
No, Stewie, you did it--

17:20.556 --> 17:22.557
Oh, wait.
Sorry, I thought you--

17:22.558 --> 17:24.809
- I thought you said "we did it."
- I did not.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.394
Good job, little boy.

17:26.395 --> 17:28.521
Maybe someday
you can come by my store

17:28.521 --> 17:30.690
and have all the cake you want.

17:30.691 --> 17:33.735
- Ooh, that sounds promising.
- Okay, that's enough.

can go fishing in my ice hole.
