00:03.670 --> 00:05.572
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

00:08.275 --> 00:09.610
Oh, hey, Josh.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.544
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.112
Is everything okay?
Not really.

00:12.112 --> 00:15.549
Mike gave me
this impossible assignment.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.519
He wants me to find some
cutting edge writer's intern

00:18.519 --> 00:20.554
and I just don't know...
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.956
Back up. Rewind.
Did you say "writer's intern"?

00:22.956 --> 00:24.124
Yeah, and get this--

00:24.124 --> 00:26.159
this person has to be
a journalism major.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.361
I'm a journalism major.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.629
Plus, they have to have

00:28.629 --> 00:30.564
some sort of college
newspaper experience.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.833
I have some sort of college
newspaper experience.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.668
Josh, you've got to
get me an interview.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.136
I would, but unfortunately

00:36.136 --> 00:38.972
some guy already slipped Mike
his girlfriend's name.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.975
Well, that's it?
They're not even going
to interview anyone else?

00:41.975 --> 00:43.210
That hardly seems fair.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.046
It isn't fair-- at least
not for the other people

00:46.046 --> 00:47.381
'cause Mike's hiring you!

00:47.381 --> 00:49.416
Oh, my gosh, Josh,
this is fantastic!

00:49.416 --> 00:51.552
You're the greatest
boyfriend in the universe.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.120
And I know--
I've been out there.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.355
I have to admit, this wasn't
a completely selfless act.

00:55.355 --> 00:58.058
Having my girlfriend
at work means I'll get
to do a lot more of this.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.626
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
Back up. rewind.

00:59.626 --> 01:02.663
I don't think anyone
at the newspaper
should know about us.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.965
Sabrina, Mike already
knows we're a couple.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.700
But I don't want
anyone else to know.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.236
I mean, this is my
first newspaper job
in the real world.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.572
It's important that people
see me as a professional

01:11.572 --> 01:13.307
not just the
photographer's
girlfriend.

01:13.307 --> 01:16.510
Fine. Okay, as far
as I'm concerned,
we've never met.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.079
You're just some
anonymous ditsy blonde.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.847
You're the best!
Whoa!

01:23.684 --> 01:29.456
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:29.456 --> 01:35.596
♪ I'm reaching out

02:07.461 --> 02:09.429
How do I look?
Hot.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.798
No, no, no, I mean,
do you I look professional?

02:11.798 --> 02:14.968
I mean, I was kind of
going for Katie Couric
meets Connie Chung

02:14.968 --> 02:16.837
with a big smear
of Ted Koppel.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.039
Well, that killed
<i>that</i> fantasy.

02:19.039 --> 02:20.807
Maybe this'll bring it back.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.809
One last kiss
before we've never met.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.213
Oh, yeah, very discreet.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.382
The office will never figure out
that you two are dating.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.250
Mike, I just want you
to know how much I appreciate...

02:30.250 --> 02:31.551
Talk is cheap.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.986
You come with me.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.856
And you, go play
with your camera.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.825
I'm assigning you
to my top reporter,
Rebecca Scott, okay?

02:38.825 --> 02:42.229
If you're smart, you're
going to learn everything
she has to teach you.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.965
Sabrina, Rebecca.
Rebecca, Sabrina.

02:45.465 --> 02:46.833
The tour is officially over.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.002
If you don't mind,
I've got a newspaper to run

02:49.002 --> 02:51.038
and a bear claw to dunk.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.206
Fine. As soon as
Kennedy is available

02:53.206 --> 02:55.108
have him call me back
on my private line.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.811
Wow. You were calling
Senator Kennedy?

02:57.811 --> 02:59.846
No. Jose Kennedy,
my hairdresser.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.715
Ted, I can get ahold of.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.650
So, you are my new intern.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.352
Yeah. I'm Sabrina Spellman.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.920
I go to Adams College.
I write for the school paper.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.555
I did a little exposé
on sororities.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.057
Well, actually,
it was 912 words.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.526
That might make it a little bit
more big than little.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.428
Sabrina, there is no
need to be nervous.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.896
I started off as
an intern, too

03:15.896 --> 03:17.931
so I know exactly what
you're going through.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.033
Oh, so you, uh,
noticed the lack of oxygen

03:20.033 --> 03:22.936
flowing through my brain?

03:22.936 --> 03:23.603
Look...

03:23.603 --> 03:25.439
obviously, you're very qualified
for this job.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.007
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have beaten out

03:27.007 --> 03:29.109
the tons of other people
I'm sure Mike interviewed.

03:29.109 --> 03:31.878
Yeah. You know,
the process was brutal.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.046
Oh, obviously

03:33.046 --> 03:34.381
it took a toll on my reflexes

03:34.381 --> 03:36.149
and as soon
as I pick up these pencils

03:36.149 --> 03:37.951
I can get started
on anything you want.

03:37.951 --> 03:41.054
You know, phone calls,
fact checking, research...

03:41.054 --> 03:43.990
How about researching if
there's a fresh pot of coffee?

03:43.990 --> 03:46.059
I'm on it.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.061
Black, no sugar.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.429
Got it.

03:51.631 --> 03:52.733
Kitchen's upstairs.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.701
You're good.

03:56.603 --> 03:57.904
( <i>gasps</i> )

03:57.904 --> 04:00.107
Gin.
Again?!

04:00.107 --> 04:01.775
You must be cheating.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.910
Yes. That must be it.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.979
How else could
a college professor

04:05.979 --> 04:09.349
with a PhD in quantum physics
possibly outsmart a cat?

04:09.349 --> 04:11.384
Great! Hilda's back.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.653
Now we can play Old Maid.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.923
Actually, I'm more in the mood
for Go Fish.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.592
Ew!

04:18.825 --> 04:20.794
I was making a joke!

04:20.794 --> 04:22.028
And now I'm laughing.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.698
Zelly, you should have
come with me.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.767
I went bargain hunting
in ancient Rome.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.970
Look what I got
from Cassius Onlius.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.172
I practically stole it.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.841
A 22-karat gold necklace

04:34.841 --> 04:36.443
for 50 lira!

04:36.443 --> 04:39.312
Wow. Did that include
the green ring around your neck?

04:39.312 --> 04:43.917
Oh! That grape-gorging
goat trader is going to pay!

04:43.917 --> 04:45.051
On the positive side

04:45.051 --> 04:46.920
it brightens up
your pasty complexion!

04:46.920 --> 04:49.156
Hilda, how many times
does that scoundrel

04:49.156 --> 04:51.858
have to rip you off
before you learn your lesson?

04:51.858 --> 04:55.162
Cassius Onlius would sell
his own mother for a profit.

04:55.162 --> 04:58.965
Actually, he sold her
for two javelins and
a wheel of parmesan.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.167
This wouldn't have happened

05:00.167 --> 05:01.434
if you had come shopping
with me.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.371
To the land of no deodorant?
I think not.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.138
Take <i>me!</i>

05:05.138 --> 05:07.407
I enjoy living
on the edge.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.776
Not the edge;
another story.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.480
So, Spellman, how goes it?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.882
Great. I, uh, have
mastered the toner change

05:15.882 --> 05:18.552
and I'm currently working
on my third paper jam.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.453
Yeah, well,
when you're done un-jamming

05:20.453 --> 05:21.888
I need 30 copies of this.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.624
Then I want you to hightail it
over to the conference table.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.660
Rebecca and the guy
who <i>isn't</i> your boyfriend

05:26.660 --> 05:29.629
need your help with a big story
they're working on.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.008
30 copies, collated
and stapled.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.343
That's amazing.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.445
Well, you know, once
you've cleared one jam...

05:45.445 --> 05:48.315
No, no, no. Our copier
neither collates nor staples.

05:48.315 --> 05:51.585
But your new intern does.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.522
Josh, have you met
our new intern, Sabrina?

05:55.522 --> 05:57.624
No. Perfect stranger.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.227
I've never seen this woman
in my entire life.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.928
I mean, hi.
Nice to meet you.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.530
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.865
It's, uh, Josh, right?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.434
Right, and...
Sabrina, right?

06:07.434 --> 06:08.068
Right.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.336
Okay.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.204
So, uh, Mike said you
might need some help

06:11.204 --> 06:12.672
with the story
you're working on?

06:12.672 --> 06:14.174
Yeah. This one is front-page.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.276
Animal testing
in the cosmetics industry.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.311
Josh is going to be taking
all the photographs

06:18.311 --> 06:20.347
and you will be doing
a lot of research.
Great.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.514
So, where do I start?

06:21.514 --> 06:23.049
Who, what, where,
why or how?

06:23.049 --> 06:26.386
Let's start with who.
Who wants lunch?

06:26.386 --> 06:29.089
Josh, shall we send her out
for Chinese or deli?

06:29.089 --> 06:32.359
You want Sabrina
to get my lunch?

06:32.359 --> 06:34.127
Well, not just <i>your</i> lunch;
everybody's.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.463
She is the intern,
and that's what she's here for.

06:36.463 --> 06:37.631
Right, Sabrina?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.332
Right. So, uh,
what can I get you?

06:39.332 --> 06:41.434
Really, I'm fine.
I ate yesterday.

06:41.434 --> 06:44.104
Yes, but it's today,
and it's time to eat again.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.672
So what would you like?

06:45.672 --> 06:47.507
I'd like you to stop
asking me what I'd like?

06:47.507 --> 06:48.642
I'm not hungry.

06:48.642 --> 06:52.379
Well, I am starving,
so get me a BLT

06:52.379 --> 06:55.749
and the turkey sandwich
Josh would have if
he were hungry.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.718
I'll be right back.
I'm checking with Copy.

06:59.552 --> 07:00.820
What are you doing?

07:00.820 --> 07:03.323
Why wouldn't you just give
me your stupid lunch order?

07:03.323 --> 07:04.891
I'm sorry.
I'm just not comfortable

07:04.891 --> 07:06.893
sending my girlfriend out
to run my errands.

07:06.893 --> 07:08.461
Look, Josh,
you've got to get over

07:08.461 --> 07:10.230
this whole
Mr. Caring Sensitive thing.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.732
Okay? When we're here,
I'm not your girlfriend.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.401
I'm a nameless, faceless drone.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.703
I wish you'd get that
through your thick head.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.105
Keep talking, and the girlfriend
thing won't be an issue.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.075
Now, that's what I want to hear.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.845
Hey, guys, I need a favor.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.714
I may be getting a call
from my boss Rebecca

07:27.714 --> 07:28.949
and in case I'm not here

07:28.949 --> 07:30.750
I don't want anyone
giving her information

07:30.750 --> 07:32.352
as to my whereabouts
or who I'm with.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.454
So you're on the paranoia wagon.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.889
Welcome aboard.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.090
I don't get it, Spellman.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.291
You get a job
at a newspaper

07:38.291 --> 07:40.160
where the whole point
is to tell the truth.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.929
Then the minute you get there,
your whole life becomes a lie.

07:42.929 --> 07:46.232
Not a lie-- a protected
privacy defense system.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.768
Guys, I want to establish
credibility on my own terms.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.837
I don't want anyone thinking
I'm just there

07:50.837 --> 07:52.739
because I'm Josh's girlfriend.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.240
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

07:54.941 --> 07:56.209
Hello?

07:56.209 --> 07:58.411
Maybe Sabrina's here,
maybe she's not here.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.679
Who wants to kn...

07:59.679 --> 08:02.048
Hello? Hi, Rebecca.

08:02.048 --> 08:05.452
Really? You liked my research
on animal testing?

08:05.452 --> 08:06.619
Wow, that means a lot

08:06.619 --> 08:08.888
coming from a seasoned
professional like you.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.123
Yeah, it is unbelievable.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.291
Who in their right mind

08:11.291 --> 08:12.892
would put lip gloss
on a schnauzer?

08:12.892 --> 08:14.594
Great. See
you tomorrow.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.029
Rebecca liked
my research!

08:16.029 --> 08:17.597
She thinks I
have potential.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.667
Me, Sabrina, the intern, not
Sabrina, Josh's girlfriend.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.302
I still think
you've got to be careful.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.005
Secrecy and deception have a way
of coming back to haunt you.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.840
You know,
it's cynical thinking like that

08:26.840 --> 08:29.009
that takes the joy
out of the human experience.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.111
I'm out of here.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.514
And don't even ask
me where I'm going.

08:36.449 --> 08:40.153
Okay, if you must know,
I'm going to the library.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.860
Morgan, why are
you throwing away
good dishes?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.661
Duh. They've all been used.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.663
We've got a huge dishwasher
in the back.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.065
His name is Hank.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.001
Whatever. This whole
working-for-a-living thing

08:55.001 --> 08:57.037
is a lot trickier
than I thought.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.407
Yes, I'm sure it's
not an easy jump from
princess to waitress.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.409
No kidding. I mean,
you'd think instead

09:02.409 --> 09:04.844
of cutting me off cold turkey,
Daddy would have

09:04.844 --> 09:06.880
canceled the platinum card first

09:06.880 --> 09:09.616
and then slowly weaned me
off the gold.

09:09.616 --> 09:13.686
Speaking of gold, that's
a nice piece of South
Africa on your finger.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.121
Oh, thanks.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.024
This was B.D.C.M.O.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.993
Before Daddy Cut Me Off.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.461
Look at the size
of that thing.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.129
No wonder you can't
balance a tray.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.965
Yeah, you don't find
many full-faceted diamonds

09:25.965 --> 09:27.467
with a VBS of two.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.935
Sounds like you know
your jewelry.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.637
Let's put it this way:

09:30.637 --> 09:32.906
not only did I have breakfast
at Tiffany's

09:32.906 --> 09:34.674
I stayed for lunch and dinner.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.744
Morgan, how would you like
to cut out of here

09:37.744 --> 09:39.279
and do some shopping?

09:39.279 --> 09:40.547
Oh, I'd love to.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.582
But what about
all these dishes?

09:42.582 --> 09:43.483
Oh.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.852
Done.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.792
Wow! This is what
I call shopping.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.995
Yeah. Too bad you won't remember
a thing when we get back.

09:55.995 --> 09:58.565
Yo, Cassius,
bangle me, baby.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.633
Ooh, nice chicken.

10:00.633 --> 10:01.801
( <i>squawks</i> )

10:02.068 --> 10:03.903
Rebecca called
me last night.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.705
She said she
loves my stuff.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.707
Oh, great.
Now, can we drop this act

10:07.707 --> 10:09.609
and tell her
you're my girlfriend?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.544
No way. I don't want her
to think we lied to her.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.746
<i>We</i> didn't. <i>You</i> did.

10:13.746 --> 10:14.948
Look, if you two strangers

10:14.948 --> 10:17.217
want people to really think
you're just drinking water

10:17.217 --> 10:19.853
you ought to put some
in your cups.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.387
I'll see you later.

10:21.387 --> 10:25.358
Hey, try some water--
it's to die for.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.394
Here's some info I dug up
on monkeys and moisturizer.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.664
Once again,
great job, Sabrina.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.600
Can I ask you a
personal question

10:33.600 --> 10:35.435
just... just
between friends?

10:35.435 --> 10:39.305
Wow, we're friends?
That was fast. Ask away.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.040
What do you think
about Josh?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.876
Josh? Oh, I never
think about Josh.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.444
Why would I think
about Josh?

10:44.444 --> 10:47.313
I was just wondering if
you thought he was cute.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.882
Me? Oh, no-no-no-no.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.951
I don't go for that unshaven,
fishy-looking Pisces type.

10:51.951 --> 10:52.952
You?

10:52.952 --> 10:54.821
Yeah. I think he's a babe.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.524
Josh? Are-are we talking
about the same Josh here?

10:57.524 --> 10:59.325
How do you know
he's a Pisces?

10:59.325 --> 11:01.628
You know, I just read it
in the employee newsletter

11:01.628 --> 11:03.429
right next to that
fun article on 401Ks.

11:03.429 --> 11:04.864
The "K" stands for "kookie."

11:04.864 --> 11:06.599
Did the newsletter
happen to mention

11:06.599 --> 11:07.867
if he has a girlfriend?

11:07.867 --> 11:09.135
Josh? Girlfriend? Please.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.137
What, do you think
he's not into girls?

11:11.137 --> 11:13.973
You heard that
rumor, too?
Wait a minute.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.209
You're not interested
in him, are you?

11:16.209 --> 11:19.746
Me? Oh, I may be desperate
but I'm not <i>that</i> desperate.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.482
No, the truth is,
he strikes me as
the loner type.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.285
You know, living at
home with his mother,
playing PlayStation 2.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.954
Yeah. He's about to move on
to PlayStation 3.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.790
I'm going to ask him out.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.464
Don't speak.
Just listen.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.166
Rebecca's going
to ask you out.

11:40.166 --> 11:40.700
Just tell her
you have a girlfriend

11:40.700 --> 11:42.135
and it'll all
be over with.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.570
Here she comes.
Got to go.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.938
By the way,
she knows you're a Pisces.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.674
Hey, Josh.

11:47.674 --> 11:50.610
Yeah, that's me,
the Pisces.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.412
Listen, I just wanted
to ask you something.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.714
Ask me anything,
and if I don't know

11:54.714 --> 11:56.216
I'll ask my girlfriend.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.117
You have a girlfriend?

11:58.117 --> 12:01.454
Oh, do I have
a girlfriend?

12:01.454 --> 12:03.323
So?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.724
He is seeing someone.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.059
Bummer!

12:06.059 --> 12:08.828
It's just weird;
I've never heard him
talk about anyone.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.964
Really? He's worked here
for three months

12:10.964 --> 12:13.333
and he's never even
mentioned his girlfriend?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.268
Maybe he's a very
private person.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.637
<i>Or</i> maybe he's not that
serious about her.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.206
He's so. I mean,
who knows, you know?

12:20.206 --> 12:22.542
The point is,
he's already taken.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.745
Sabrina, I am going to put you
on a very special assignment.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.180
Those investigative skills

12:27.180 --> 12:28.982
are really going
to come in handy.

12:28.982 --> 12:29.983
Lay it on me.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.451
Find out who this girl is

12:31.451 --> 12:32.652
that Josh is dating.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.987
Uh...

12:33.987 --> 12:36.756
Me? I mean,
you want <i>me</i> to find out?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.358
Yes, and see if
you can find out

12:38.358 --> 12:39.759
just how serious they are.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.893
Fine, but I really think

12:40.893 --> 12:42.629
all this research
is a waste of time.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.697
I mean, Josh doesn't strike me
as your type.

12:44.697 --> 12:47.934
What about Gordon,
the accountant? He's adorable.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.302
He is 70.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.371
But he just got a new heart.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.775
I give it to you
for 40 lira.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.076
Please.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.746
I could buy this for 20
at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas

12:59.746 --> 13:01.514
plus get a free spin
on the wheel.

13:01.514 --> 13:05.151
30 lira, and I throw in this
handcrafted rattan kifa

13:05.151 --> 13:07.287
Ooh! Take it, take it.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.554
15 lira, final offer

13:08.554 --> 13:11.124
or we go to the thief
in the next stall.

13:11.124 --> 13:11.624
20.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.992
We're out of here.

13:12.992 --> 13:17.196
Okay, okay, 15 lira,
but no kifa.

13:17.196 --> 13:18.031
So we have a deal?

13:18.031 --> 13:19.666
Does Nero fiddle?

13:19.666 --> 13:20.967
Oh, did you hear
that, Morgan?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.135
We have a deal!

13:22.135 --> 13:25.738
Pay the man and show him
your fingers, so he can size it.

13:25.738 --> 13:26.806
Do me a favor, huh?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.741
Next time, leave
Princess at home.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.143
In your dreams, toga boy.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.413
From now on, Princess comes
with me on every Roman holiday.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.248
( <i>trumpet fanfare</i> )

13:35.248 --> 13:37.483
MAN:
Hail, Caesar!

13:42.021 --> 13:43.523
When it comes to jewelry

13:43.523 --> 13:45.858
Princess is worth her weight
in gold.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.394
So what do you say,
we hit Neiman Marcus, Aurelius?

13:48.394 --> 13:50.196
Morgan?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.432
Morgan?

13:52.565 --> 13:54.867
Cassius, I lost Princess!

13:54.867 --> 13:59.038
Perhaps I can interest you
in a matching breastplate?

13:59.038 --> 14:00.940
How much?

14:01.107 --> 14:03.109
I'm in deep, Miles.
Rebecca wants me to find out

14:03.109 --> 14:05.311
who Josh's girlfriend is
and then report back to her.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.781
Well, you could...
Come clean about
Josh and me dating?

14:08.781 --> 14:10.249
I thought of that,
but then Rebecca

14:10.249 --> 14:11.484
would hate me
for lying to her

14:11.484 --> 14:13.252
I'll blow whatever
progress I made so far.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.521
Why don't you just...
Say Josh isn't
dating me anymore?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.357
But then Rebecca will
be all over him again.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.192
Oh, what about...?
Just keeping
up a charade?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.426
It is the only
possible option

14:20.426 --> 14:21.761
but then I still
have to come up

14:21.761 --> 14:23.062
with some
fictitious
girlfriend.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.997
Have you ever
considered...
That's it!

14:24.997 --> 14:26.599
...letting me finish a sentence?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.136
Hey, don't speak.
Just listen.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.738
Roxy is your girlfriend.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.039
Roxy?! Are you nuts?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.007
No, but you are,
about her. Got to go.

14:35.007 --> 14:39.512
Man, got to stop hanging
out by this water cooler.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.347
Can I help you, Miss?

14:41.347 --> 14:44.150
I'm looking
for my boyfriend, Josh.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.386
Oh, that must make
you Josh's girlfriend.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.087
Only for the next
five minutes.

14:48.087 --> 14:50.890
Remember I like my jeans folded
and my T-shirts hand-washed.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.926
There's the woman after
your man-- I mean, my man.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.562
I mean, I never agreed to
have hand-wash anything. Go!

14:56.562 --> 14:58.531
Rebecca, look who's here.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.866
Josh's girlfriend.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.868
Hi, honey.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.770
How is it going?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.905
Uh... good.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.041
Well, thanks
for stopping by.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.309
They're a couple?

15:10.309 --> 15:12.712
Yeah. Couple people
madly in love.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.982
But he didn't even
kiss her hello.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.451
Oh, I'm sure there's
all kinds of passion

15:18.451 --> 15:21.254
bubbling underneath
the surface.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.055
Mmm...

15:23.055 --> 15:25.758
Wow, honey, can't get
enough of that sugar.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.060
Yeah. Well, there's a lot
more where that came from.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.997
I know. That's why
I'm your girlfriend.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.732
Whoo! There's one hot couple.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.468
Somebody throw a bucket
of water on those two.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.770
Are we looking
at the same couple?

15:38.638 --> 15:43.976
Okay, come here,
you sexy thing, you.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.278
Ohh!

15:46.212 --> 15:47.480
What are you doing?!

15:47.480 --> 15:48.481
What were <i>you</i> doing?

15:48.481 --> 15:50.583
Trying to kiss my sweetie.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.385
Well, find yourself
another sweetie.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.121
I'll make Miles do my laundry.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.191
Did you hear that?
She just broke
up with Josh.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.859
You know what that
means, don't you?

15:59.859 --> 16:03.229
We've to do everything in our
power to get them back together.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.998
No! We do everything
in our power to get <i>me</i>
together with Josh.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.667
How do you think
I should approach him?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.769
Well, give him a year
or two to get over it

16:09.769 --> 16:12.338
and then give him another year
to sow his wild oats

16:12.338 --> 16:14.073
and then if you're
still interested

16:14.073 --> 16:15.274
ask him out for coffee.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.377
( <i>bubbling</i> )

16:19.412 --> 16:22.014
Zelda, I need you to come
with me to ancient Rome.

16:22.014 --> 16:23.616
I'm running.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.550
You don't understand.

16:24.550 --> 16:25.885
I went back to the Colosseum.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.119
I found this gorgeous ring.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.287
I didn't get the key fob.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.288
Get to the point.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.691
I'm one step away
from discovering cold fusion.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.993
I took Morgan with me
and I lost her.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.428
I'll get my purse.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.997
So, now Rebecca's hot
on your tail again.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.165
What am I going to do?

16:39.165 --> 16:41.167
I'll tell you what
you're <i>not</i> going to do.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.035
Fix me up with any more
girls like Roxy.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.604
I think
she tore my rotator cuff.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.906
I want you to kiss her,
not swallow her tonsils.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.407
Hey, you're the one
who told me

16:48.407 --> 16:50.343
to really sell her
the girlfriend thing.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.246
Look, I'm sorry I got you
involved in this whole big lie.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.947
I promise I'll
make it up to you.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.315
Yeah? Starting when?

16:56.315 --> 16:57.850
Starting now.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.220
Wow. Well, well.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.555
Rebecca!
Rebecca!

17:02.555 --> 17:05.691
I bet this wasn't
in the employee newsletter.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.659
I can explain.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.660
No need to.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.629
A picture is worth
a thousand words.

17:09.629 --> 17:10.830
I knew you liked him.

17:10.830 --> 17:11.998
I don't! Really.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.367
Rebecca, this
is all my fault.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.735
Save it, Sabrina.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.070
It won't be
an issue anymore.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.006
Think she knows?

17:26.879 --> 17:29.482
Figured she'd be
in the last place we looked.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.816
Okay, here's
the plan.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.219
You distract the eunuch
while I smuggle Morgan out.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.121
Why do I always have
to distract the eunuch?

17:35.121 --> 17:36.989
Because you're always
the one that gets us

17:36.989 --> 17:38.824
into this ridiculous
scenario, that's why.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.192
Fine!
I'll distract the eunuch.

17:40.192 --> 17:44.497
Oh, hey, baldy.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.666
You got a little olive
oil right there.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.703
MORGAN:
Put me down!
My nails are still wet.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.905
You'll never get away with this!

17:52.905 --> 17:55.975
My boyfriend is in charge
of this whole empire!

17:57.276 --> 17:58.711
Well, well,
that was fun.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.647
Nothing like trying
to outrun half
the Roman Army

18:01.647 --> 18:03.449
with a giant urn
on your head.

18:03.449 --> 18:04.784
Oh, come on.
It's not like

18:04.784 --> 18:06.552
you didn't get
a few phone numbers

18:06.552 --> 18:07.720
Hilda, that
had to be

18:07.720 --> 18:09.889
one of your more
spectacular screwups.

18:09.889 --> 18:10.923
Like I'm the only one
who ever screws up?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.091
Hardly.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.895
May I direct your attention
to the dining room.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.165
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

18:19.165 --> 18:21.334
A not so itsy-bitsy spider.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.402
Hi, guys.
Just hanging out.

18:23.402 --> 18:26.372
It's like somebody got herself
tangled up in a web of lies.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.608
It must have been some
pretty elaborate lies

18:28.608 --> 18:30.209
to get caught
in a web this big.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.378
Thank God, someone
to take the heat off me.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.680
Well, I'll tell you all about
them after you cut me out.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.616
That's only
a temporary fix.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.085
Well, how can I permanently
solve my problem?

18:39.085 --> 18:42.121
You have to go to the people
you lie to and tell the truth.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.992
You know, I think I'll just stay
here, start my own Web site.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.296
Okay, I'm just going to tell
Rebecca the whole story

18:50.296 --> 18:51.364
from beginning to end.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.432
Hopefully, she'll see
that my intentions were good

18:53.432 --> 18:54.367
and I'll be forgiven.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.603
Okay, wait. You might want
to lose the cobweb.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.811
Has anyone seen Rebecca?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.080
No. She must have come in
in the middle of the night

19:08.080 --> 19:09.382
and cleared out
all her stuff.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.018
Josh, did you hear
that? Rebecca's gone.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.953
I totally humiliated
the star reporter.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.888
With a great big assist from me.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.956
No, no, no.
I'm the one

19:16.956 --> 19:19.091
who got us into this mess
in the first place

19:19.091 --> 19:20.760
and now I'm going
to get us out of it.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.129
No, Lucy, not another plan.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.364
Excuse me.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.668
Everybody, gather around
and listen up.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.703
Contrary to
what my fine acting skills

19:30.703 --> 19:32.204
may have led you to believe

19:32.204 --> 19:34.440
I do not find Josh
a pathetic mama's boy.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.575
In fact, the sorry
truth is that

19:36.575 --> 19:38.044
Josh and I
are dating.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.545
Yep, that's right, Josh and I

19:39.545 --> 19:41.247
are boyfriend-girlfriend,
an item.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.315
We're absolutely crazy
about each other.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.684
They get the point.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.086
But just because
Josh got me the job

19:47.086 --> 19:49.488
does not mean
that I lack
the ability

19:49.488 --> 19:51.557
to be accepted
on my own terms.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.393
True, I should have never lied
about the relationship

19:54.393 --> 19:56.662
but trust me,
nobody feels worse than I do

19:56.662 --> 19:59.532
that this paper lost its best
reporter because of me.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.667
Hey, Rebecca didn't leave
because of you.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.903
She got a job
as a foreign correspondent

20:03.903 --> 20:05.337
for the <i>Washington Post.</i>

20:05.337 --> 20:05.971
What?

20:05.971 --> 20:07.440
She said she was going to

20:07.440 --> 20:09.575
stop by that coffee joint
you worked at and say good-bye.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.645
Making my little outburst
completely unnecessary

20:12.645 --> 20:15.181
and me the object
of total humiliation.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.650
Thank you. Good night.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.485
Who the heck was that?

20:19.485 --> 20:22.755
Beats me. I think she
cleans the bathroom.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.989
Roxy was right.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.393
Secrecy and lying come
back to haunt you.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.761
Sabrina, I know why you did it

20:28.761 --> 20:31.030
and there's nothing wrong
with lying to be accepted

20:31.030 --> 20:32.932
for who you are
and not who you're dating.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.667
But, please,
just promise me one thing?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.802
From now on, everything
will be out in the open?

20:36.802 --> 20:39.171
You got it. Hey, I guess
that means we don't have

20:39.171 --> 20:40.940
to hide in a corner
to kiss anymore.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.908
I knew there was an upside.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.677
People,
people, please.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.812
Show a little class, will you?

20:46.812 --> 20:49.381
What do you think
the supply room is for?

20:56.222 --> 20:58.224
It all seems so real.

20:58.224 --> 21:00.159
I was dating this
Roman emperor

21:00.159 --> 21:02.762
and I was living in
this beautiful palace.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.829
Nice memory spells.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.364
She remembers every detail.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.166
She doesn't.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.734
Oh, and you were
there, too, Hilda.

21:08.734 --> 21:09.735
And so was Zelda.

21:09.735 --> 21:13.105
She clobbered this bald,
fat man with her purse.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.342
No. <i>I</i> distracted the eunuch.

21:16.342 --> 21:17.877
What do you want, a medal?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.378
I hope you learned
your lesson

21:19.378 --> 21:20.980
about shopping
in ancient Rome.

21:20.980 --> 21:26.051
Believe me, I am so
through with ancient Rome.

21:26.051 --> 21:27.453
Morgan, ever shop for
sapphires in Mesopotamia?
