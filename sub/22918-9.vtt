WEBVTT

00:11.200 --> 00:14.200
[cheering]

00:15.880 --> 00:17.280
[boy] Over here!

00:20.040 --> 00:21.520
[man]  I'm afraid it's true.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.680
His Royal Highness has struggled.

00:24.760 --> 00:29.240
And whilst Her Majesty's desire to have
her son be the first heir to the throne

00:29.320 --> 00:31.680
to attend a normal school is laudable,

00:32.360 --> 00:35.360
and we were delighted
to have His Royal Highness at Cheam...

00:36.520 --> 00:39.280
-[groans]
-we should not delude ourselves...

00:39.360 --> 00:42.160
-[boys laugh]
-that it has been entirely successful.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.440
Thank you.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.840
[man]  The press run stories
about him almost daily.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.120
The other boys read about him
in the newspapers.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.720
They see his detective.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.520
-[boys laugh]
-We do what we can, but...

00:59.600 --> 01:01.640
boys that age can be cruel.

01:03.400 --> 01:08.040
The fact is,
His Royal Highness is different.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.040
And not just because of who he is,
who his parents are.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.600
He's uncommonly shy. Sensitive.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.240
Delicate.

01:21.760 --> 01:26.400
So, if you're asking me where,
in my professional opinion,

01:26.480 --> 01:27.960
he should go to senior school...

01:29.360 --> 01:30.480
Yes, I am.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.760
I would say that in Eton College,
you have the perfect solution.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.680
Right on your doorstep.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.520
[puts cup and saucer down]

01:40.600 --> 01:42.640
Look, Charles!

01:42.720 --> 01:45.520
Look, you'll be so much closer to us.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.600
The weekends, you can just
run up the hill and you'll be with us all.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.680
[whispers] And you can sleep
in your own bed.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.320
I have to ask Daddy,
but I'm sure he'll agree.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.240
[Charles]  Dear Uncle Dickie,

02:02.320 --> 02:06.760
Mommy told me that she had chosen
Eton College for me for senior school.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.240
I must say, I was very relieved
and now find myself very excited.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.400
Being at Eton makes so much sense.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.520
Am I right in thinking
that you went there, too?

02:17.240 --> 02:19.040
[Mountbatten]  I was never at Eton.

02:19.120 --> 02:23.400
I was tormented
by a particularly dull tutor at home.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.800
Then I was sent to the Naval College
in Osborne.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.520
So, I'm very envious of Eton.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.800
What great fun you'll have there.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.960
And may I suggest a gentleman's outing
to meet Arthur Cunningham,

02:37.040 --> 02:40.840
head cutter of the finest House
in Savile Row?

02:40.920 --> 02:43.680
-[tailor] Sir.
-Is that a two in the hand?

02:43.760 --> 02:45.600
-Yes, sir.
-Also known as?

02:45.680 --> 02:47.760
-The Eton knot.
-The Eton knot.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.360
[Cunningham] And shoot the cuffs.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.680
I think slightly higher on the shoulder.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.240
Yes, sir. Quarter of an inch.

02:54.440 --> 03:00.880
And we position the hat with the thumbs.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.000
The Eton suit.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.520
[camera shutter clicks]

03:04.600 --> 03:06.600
-[Mountbatten] Next size up?
-Five, sir.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.760
Five?

03:07.840 --> 03:08.920
-Five.
-Five.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.840
-Whites.
-[camera clicks]

03:14.080 --> 03:15.280
Breathe in.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.720
-[Mountbatten] Good.
-[camera shutter clicks]

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
[Charles] Thank you.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.960
-Now, doesn't that lift the spirits?
-Yes, it does!

03:28.040 --> 03:29.440
Finishing touch.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.200
Oh, yes!

03:33.920 --> 03:34.920
[camera shutter clicks]

04:50.080 --> 04:52.920
[pop music playing on car radio]

05:05.360 --> 05:06.680
[man] Congratulations, sir!

05:09.360 --> 05:10.440
[car door shuts]

05:13.040 --> 05:14.760
-[Elizabeth] Well done, you!
-Thank you!

05:14.840 --> 05:18.520
[Philip] We won by half a length, which is
the nautical equivalent of a nose.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.880
-Ah. Neck! You've burnt your forehead.
-You should see my legs.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.200
Oh, thank you.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.880
We left it rather late admittedly.
But came good at the last marker.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.080
Which is the nautical equivalent
of the final furlock.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.120
[sighs] Furlong!

05:33.200 --> 05:36.040
[Philip laughs]

05:36.960 --> 05:38.920
After dinner you should look in
on Charles.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.120
To show him the trophy? Good idea.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.400
No. I thought to compliment him
on his uniforms.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.920
-What uniforms?
-[Elizabeth] His uniforms for Eton.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.480
What are you talking about?
Charles is going to Gordonstoun.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.880
-Not necessarily.
-[Philip] Yes, necessarily.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.040
-It's not set in stone.
-Give me a hammer and chisel

05:53.120 --> 05:54.320
and watch me carve it into one.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.480
-Philip.
-Gordonstoun is the right place for him.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.720
It's no exaggeration to say that school
made me, and it can make Charles.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.640
He won't learn a thing
about himself at Eton.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.920
Yes, but he might just survive
or flourish.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.080
Or he might just become
another wet, namby-pamby,

06:06.160 --> 06:09.280
mollycoddled twit like the rest
of the British upper classes.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.280
-Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness.
-[clock chimes]

06:13.360 --> 06:15.200
Dickie thinks
it's the right school for him.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.040
-It's none of Dickie's business.
-He's got a soft spot for Charles.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.800
-They write to one another.
-Since when?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.480
-He heard how unhappy Charles was.
-I wish he'd stop meddling.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.480
Well, meddling is what Dickie does.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.960
We would be betraying our son
if we let Eton have him.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.640
He's going to Gordonstoun,
and that's the end of it.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.840
All right, fine,
if you feel that strongly about it.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.400
-I do.
-We'll return the uniforms.

06:35.480 --> 06:39.520
-You can burn them for all I care.
-But you can break it to Charles, not me.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.480
-Fine.
-[man] Your Majesty.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.800
[Elizabeth] Thank you, James.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.920
[Charles] I do like Scotland,
but isn't it a long way from home?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.080
-No.
-And a terrible inconvenience

06:50.160 --> 06:53.960
-for you to come and visit me there?
-No. Not at all.

06:54.040 --> 06:58.880
I've already decided to fly you
up there myself as a special treat.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.440
But...

07:00.840 --> 07:02.040
I won't lie to you.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.560
When I heard I was going to Gordonstoun,
I felt exactly as you do now.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.600
Wretched.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.880
I wanted to stay at home
with my dear, favorite sister.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.480
I wanted the easier, softer way.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.240
But in order to grow up properly,

07:18.320 --> 07:21.400
you need to get away
from all this nonsense.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.080
Would you like me to let you into
a big secret?

07:26.160 --> 07:27.160
Please.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.920
This... is not the real world.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.120
John. Get rid of those.

07:43.280 --> 07:47.000
You can have my old jumper.
The uniform hasn't changed a bit.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.480
Pop your head through.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.000
That's the first lesson.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.320
Who we are is not what we wear
or what glitters.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.000
It's the spirit that defines us.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.800
In here.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.280
[Don]  Philip?

08:08.640 --> 08:09.720
Philip?

08:10.800 --> 08:14.120
[Don speaks German]

08:14.200 --> 08:16.400
[continues speaking in German]

08:19.320 --> 08:21.720
[speaking German]

08:31.040 --> 08:32.880
[speaking German]

08:32.960 --> 08:35.280
[in English] You're not really going to
fly him to school

08:35.360 --> 08:36.720
dressed for a funeral?

08:36.799 --> 08:37.799
Of course.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.120
One might as well be dressed
for the inevitable.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.360
If we land safely, I'll change.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.640
-She's your sister!
-[Philip laughs]

08:49.680 --> 08:51.680
[Philip and Don speak German]

08:51.760 --> 08:53.360
[Philip] See you soon.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.400
[speaks German]

09:06.480 --> 09:07.920
Uh, yes, I'm Greek.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.600
[Cecile] Come along.
Let's get this over with.

09:24.480 --> 09:29.560
[prays in Latin]

09:29.640 --> 09:31.480
-[man speaks German]
- Ja.

09:31.560 --> 09:36.280
Why did we do this? I hate flying.
We should have gone by train.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.800
-[man speaks German]
-[Cecile shrieks]

09:40.080 --> 09:43.920
-[shrieks]
-[motors splutter]

09:44.000 --> 09:45.640
[shouting]

09:45.720 --> 09:47.360
Give me your hand.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.120
[Cecile shrieks]

09:50.200 --> 09:51.520
[Philip] It's fine. Look at me.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.160
-It's all right. It's just air.
-Yes.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.960
-[Cecile] It's beautiful!
-[Philip] It's freezing!

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
Why couldn't I have stayed in Germany...

10:09.760 --> 10:10.960
and gone to school there?

10:11.480 --> 10:16.160
Because Father thought it very important
that you be educated by a genius.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.240
And since Dr. Hahn is a Jew,
staying in Germany was impossible.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.760
Fine.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.240
-But why did the genius choose Scotland?
-[scoffs]

10:31.480 --> 10:33.120
[car horn beeps]

10:35.400 --> 10:36.320
[boy laughs]

10:37.240 --> 10:41.080
-[horn honks]
-[sheep bleat]

10:52.840 --> 10:54.360
[boy] Your Royal Highness.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.760
-[boy] Who's that?
-[Jim] Some foreigner.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.400
-[boy] What's your name?
-Philip.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.680
Philip what?

11:03.760 --> 11:05.280
It's just Philip.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.080
[boy] Hey. Back to work.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.400
Philip! Come along!

11:23.480 --> 11:25.560
[crowd shouts]

11:26.840 --> 11:30.400
-[clamoring]
-[reporter] Your Royal Highness!

11:30.480 --> 11:32.640
[announcer]  The big day began
at London Airport,

11:32.720 --> 11:35.000
where the Duke of Edinburgh
surprised Prince Charles

11:35.080 --> 11:37.280
with the decision to fly him to school.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.560
This is the really modern way
to go to school.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.200
By airplane, piloted by your father,

11:42.280 --> 11:45.560
on this most important day
for our future king.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.000
-[Hahn] Welcome!
-My dear Dr. Hahn.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.440
-Welcome home, sir.
-It's good to be back.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.160
[Hahn] Mr. Tennant,
the head of Charles's year.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.440
-[Tennant] Your Royal Highness.
-[Philip] Pleasure.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.160
-Good morning, boys!
-Good morning, sir.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.200
-[Hahn] Your Royal Highness. Welcome.
-[Charles] Thank you.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.400
[Hahn] You know this school runs
in your father's blood.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.440
He was one of the first pupils here.

12:22.520 --> 12:26.280
-He helped build the place.
-I did, I built that wall.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.200
[Hahn] Yes. Things have changed
a little since your father's time.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.080
But not the important things.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.040
The principles remain unchanged.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.120
-Yeah, good. You haven't gone soft.
-No.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.800
Don't want him mollycoddled
in some luxury hotel.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.560
[photographer] This way, Prince Charles!

12:47.640 --> 12:48.640
[reporters shout]

12:48.720 --> 12:50.280
[man] Are you ready for how tough it is?

12:50.360 --> 12:51.920
How do you feel being far away, sir?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.560
[Philip] All right. Good. Thank you.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.440
[reporter] Is this good for him, sir?

12:55.520 --> 12:57.080
[man] Is this the right school for him?

12:57.160 --> 13:00.000
[chattering]

13:00.080 --> 13:04.160
This was your father's dormitory.
We've even given you his old bed.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.760
-Hello, boys.
-[boy] Morning, sir.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.840
[Hahn] Simon Harper, sir,
dormitory guardian.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.120
Simon will teach you the rules
and look after you.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.400
[Simon] We've given you the window,
Your Royal Highness.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.440
No, no. Don't call him that.
It's just Charles.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.720
[Simon] Yes, sir. Charles.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.040
Thank you. That's awfully kind.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.200
This is Geddes.

13:23.640 --> 13:24.840
Charles.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.160
-[Simon] This is Gilkinson.
-[window bangs]

13:27.960 --> 13:30.280
-[Philip chuckles]
-Memories flooding back, sir?

13:30.360 --> 13:31.240
Yes.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.480
Happy ones, I hope.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.680
[Simon] This is Griffiths.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.400
The happiest. Who's that?

13:38.760 --> 13:40.120
[Hahn] The royal detective.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.600
The palace insisted.
In case of press intrusion.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.480
The whole point is the boy learns
to fend for himself.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.560
Don't worry.
We know what's expected of us.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.360
[announcer]  The Duke wasted no time
before signing Prince Charles up

13:57.440 --> 13:59.400
to Gordonstoun's
infamous Annual Challenge,

13:59.480 --> 14:02.720
notorious for testing endurance
and determination

14:02.800 --> 14:05.640
in the inhospitable Scottish Highlands.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.520
At Gordonstoun, fitness is valued
just as highly as academic excellence.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.320
The prince is sure to be put
through his paces

14:12.400 --> 14:14.600
by their grueling physical regime.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.520
This is surely the place
to make our young prince

14:17.600 --> 14:20.480
into a man ready to serve his country.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.840
[Simon] It doesn't close.
The thing's broken.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.160
-The rain's getting in.
-The frame's broken, idiot.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.200
-[Simon] Now what are you doing?
-Moving the bed.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.600
-Put it back!
-But the sheets are getting wet.

14:44.680 --> 14:45.760
Put it back or I'll put you on report.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.720
[Simon] Lights out!

15:02.280 --> 15:05.000
[shivering]

15:13.600 --> 15:15.640
-[boys shout]
-Come on, we're going to be late.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.080
Faster!

15:18.560 --> 15:19.800
Come on, lads.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.080
-Push out.
-Hurry up! Let's get it over with!

15:23.160 --> 15:25.760
-Out of my way.
-Let's go!

15:25.840 --> 15:27.000
Hurry up!

15:27.080 --> 15:30.480
[Jim] Get up! Your Royal Highness.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.360
Move.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.640
[shivers]

15:46.520 --> 15:48.080
[boy] What's wrong?

15:48.160 --> 15:49.640
It's freezing.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.600
[boy] Wait until you've had
your cold shower! Come on!

15:53.200 --> 15:54.520
[coughs]

16:02.680 --> 16:04.600
[man] One more lap. Come on!

16:05.560 --> 16:07.360
[sheep bleating]

16:12.880 --> 16:14.800
[panting]

16:17.200 --> 16:21.120
[boys shouting] Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

16:25.120 --> 16:26.600
[Jim] Right. Come on then!

16:29.160 --> 16:31.920
[boys yell]

16:39.080 --> 16:40.440
[boy] Move!

17:08.400 --> 17:09.720
Come on.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.200
-[scrubbing]
-[chattering]

17:26.319 --> 17:27.680
[boy] Oi.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.880
-[splash]
-[Jim] Hey! Get down here!

17:33.920 --> 17:36.440
This isn't optional.
It's your assigned work project.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.120
It's manual labor.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.600
If Hahn wants this place rebuilt,
he ought to pay the staff to do it.

17:43.840 --> 17:44.920
[Jim] Staff...

17:50.520 --> 17:54.200
-[Jim] Do you think you're better than us?
-Actually, I know I am.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.680
-Keep a lookout. Oi. This will be good.
-[boy] Will do.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.560
-[bucket clatters]
-Some mongrel European count?

18:06.120 --> 18:07.240
It's prince, actually.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.080
[Jim] We know all about your lot.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.520
Your sisters are all Nazis.

18:16.720 --> 18:21.440
And your father's washed his hands of you
so he can be with his whore in Paris.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.760
Uh... It's Monaco.

18:24.440 --> 18:30.760
Your mother's a mental defective,
locked away in some asylum.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.600
You're no one,
and you're going to do the work.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.520
Why? Because I bloody well say so.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.360
[grunting and groaning]

18:44.880 --> 18:46.880
-[crashing and banging]
-[Jim] Get off!

18:48.920 --> 18:50.720
-[crashing]
-[Jim] Get off!

18:51.480 --> 18:52.560
[Philip yells]

18:58.120 --> 19:00.000
[boys laugh]

19:01.640 --> 19:03.280
Here!

19:03.360 --> 19:05.240
-[ducks quacking]
-[Philip grunts]

19:12.480 --> 19:14.440
[exhales]

19:16.200 --> 19:17.880
Sit yourself down.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.000
Jim threw the first punch.

19:26.080 --> 19:30.080
Mnh-mnh. I understand injustice.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.840
We're both exiles.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.720
Both victims and I understand your anger.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.440
But on its current path,

19:39.520 --> 19:42.840
the world will fill with anger
and soon will be destroyed.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.960
So here, away from the madness,
we must build a new way.

19:46.040 --> 19:49.760
A new school. A new philosophy.
A new ethos.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.040
The world needs saviors.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.320
A generation of remarkable young men

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
who have put fury behind them,

19:58.360 --> 20:01.200
who embrace their pain and their struggle.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.320
All men must step into the unknown.

20:05.880 --> 20:11.240
There, only there,
in the annihilation of hate and anger,

20:12.600 --> 20:17.240
and ego, is our salvation.

20:18.840 --> 20:19.920
Hmm?

20:23.560 --> 20:27.280
I can't stay here. They're all mad.
Completely mad.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.520
Cousin Louis' wedding falls
in your half-term.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.080
Don wants to fly.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.640
I'll tell him I won't go and you can come
and stay with me, in Germany.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.520
-Just the two of us?
- Probably.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.680
What does that mean?

20:41.640 --> 20:44.000
I didn't tell you. I'm expecting.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.160
[Philip]  Expecting what?

20:45.240 --> 20:47.680
-[Cecile]  A little one.
-A-again?

20:47.760 --> 20:50.840
[Cecile]  Don't be like that.
Castles need to be filled.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.840
And Herr Hitler is encouraging us to have

20:52.920 --> 20:54.560
-as many children as we can.
-[men sing]

20:54.640 --> 20:57.000
As Germany grows,
she will need more soldiers.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.520
[speaking German]

21:00.600 --> 21:03.400
-[men singing]
-Hello?

21:03.480 --> 21:06.720
[singing continuing]

21:08.840 --> 21:10.320
Hello?

21:10.400 --> 21:13.080
[singing continuing]

21:17.200 --> 21:18.520
[coins jingle]

21:23.040 --> 21:25.920
[bell rings]

21:30.600 --> 21:31.680
[boy] Idiot!

21:31.760 --> 21:33.120
[Charles groans]

21:34.360 --> 21:36.360
[boy laughs]

21:44.000 --> 21:46.040
[Charles panting]

21:51.480 --> 21:52.600
[car door shuts]

21:55.120 --> 21:57.560
[Mountbatten]  I thought
I would come up here

21:57.640 --> 21:59.560
and see how you were settling in.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.600
Have you made friends?

22:01.680 --> 22:03.560
[Charles] One. I think.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.960
Although, it's quite hard to understand
what he says sometimes.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.320
Yes, I hear they've
let some local boys in.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.480
Charles.

22:15.680 --> 22:21.920
Even though I am close to your father,
I am not your father.

22:22.920 --> 22:28.560
Things you feel you cannot show him
or tell him

22:28.640 --> 22:31.520
because you feel they might upset him...

22:32.080 --> 22:36.160
-Yes, sir.
-Or even disappoint him...

22:37.960 --> 22:40.960
Those are the things you can say to me,

22:41.040 --> 22:44.840
safe in the knowledge that they will
never be repeated to anyone else.

22:44.920 --> 22:48.200
-Anyone else on earth.
-[boys shout]

22:48.280 --> 22:49.520
Yes, sir.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.560
Charles, if you're not happy here,
you must tell me

22:53.640 --> 22:56.120
and I will take care of it.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.080
[boy] Dumbo!

23:02.120 --> 23:03.880
[boys laugh]

23:23.560 --> 23:26.760
What are you doing in here?
Why aren't you dressed for dinner?

23:27.520 --> 23:30.960
-I need to talk to you.
-What about?

23:33.280 --> 23:34.680
Could you close the door?

23:45.720 --> 23:49.440
I've made the decision to take Charles out
of Gordonstoun and bring him home.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.560
Decide what you like. He's staying there.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.040
Dickie's just reported
his unhappiness to me.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.600
Dickie's a meddling, interfering fool
who knows nothing.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.920
Well, he knows an unhappy child
when he sees one.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.920
And by all accounts, Charles is wretched.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.440
He's tormented from the moment
that he wakes up

24:04.520 --> 24:06.400
to the moment that he goes to sleep.

24:07.360 --> 24:12.120
Do you know what he calls the place?
"Hell on earth, Colditz with kilts."

24:12.200 --> 24:14.880
-[Philip] I don't want to debate this.
-Well, you have to.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.600
And not just because he's your son.
Because he's the future king.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.120
Bullied children are scarred for life.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.000
And scarred children
make destroyed adults.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.840
[Philip] You and I had an agreement.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.600
A deal that ensured there would be

24:30.680 --> 24:33.640
some level of equality between us
in the marriage.

24:33.720 --> 24:37.760
It's my decision Charles go
to Gordonstoun-- not now!

24:43.160 --> 24:45.800
And that would be fine,
for all our other children.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.240
But Charles is the future of the Crown.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.840
And in the name of the Crown
and as his mother,

24:52.920 --> 24:56.680
I have decided to take him out
of Gordonstoun and bring him home,

24:56.760 --> 24:58.960
to Eton, to Windsor, where he belongs.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.560
You can't always fall back on the Crown.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.680
Oh, yes, I can. And I will.

25:03.760 --> 25:07.040
Then you would do well to remember
the promises you made to me.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.400
And the consequence breaking those
might have on the Crown.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.440
Charles's education...

25:14.600 --> 25:16.600
is my responsibility.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.800
Yours is to honor your word...

25:22.520 --> 25:25.200
and keep your husband.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.680
[Elizabeth quivers]

26:05.040 --> 26:07.560
[school bell rings]

26:28.080 --> 26:30.960
-[Hahn] Charles.
-Hello, sir.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.520
Are you preparing
for the Annual Challenge?

26:34.120 --> 26:35.280
I am.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.960
The Duke of Edinburgh
is giving the prize this year.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.880
I know.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.280
He's spoken to me a great deal about
the significance of the Challenge.

26:45.120 --> 26:49.320
The Challenge is one of this school's
great traditions, but it is arduous.

26:50.800 --> 26:51.960
You don't think I'm up to it.

26:53.520 --> 26:57.840
Physical endurance is only one path
to self-determination.

26:57.920 --> 27:02.840
You have your own particular challenge
here at this school given who you are.

27:03.480 --> 27:06.200
[bell rings]

27:10.720 --> 27:14.720
Your father struggled, too.

27:17.400 --> 27:23.040
He had difficulties of a different kind.
Great difficulties, great pain.

27:23.120 --> 27:29.600
But he never gave up, and then,
with help, he prevailed.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.880
I think I would still like
to do the Challenge, sir.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.520
I think my father expects it.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.080
[whistle blows]

27:46.160 --> 27:47.240
-[boys shout]
-Move!

27:47.320 --> 27:49.760
-Come on, boys! Let's go!
-[Philip] Give me a hand up!

27:49.840 --> 27:52.840
-Come on!
-Go on!

27:54.440 --> 27:55.720
-Pull up!
-Almost there.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.040
[Jim] Come on. Help me up!

27:57.120 --> 27:58.320
[boy] Get up here!

27:58.880 --> 28:00.640
[Philip] Did you think I was
going to let it go?

28:00.720 --> 28:02.480
-[Jim] Help me up!
-[boy] Philip!

28:02.560 --> 28:04.000
[boys gasp]

28:04.080 --> 28:05.160
[exhales]

28:05.240 --> 28:07.800
-[boy 1] Are you all right, Jim?
-[boy 2] Serves him right!

28:08.520 --> 28:11.080
[Hahn] I don't expect you
to get on with everyone.

28:11.160 --> 28:15.000
What I do expect of all my pupils
is to conform with Platonic ideals--

28:15.080 --> 28:18.960
to argue without quarreling,
to quarrel without suspecting,

28:19.040 --> 28:22.680
-to suspect without slandering.
-Sir--

28:22.760 --> 28:25.440
You and James will have
extra building duties.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.120
-You can work on the main gate together.
-Look, in my defense--

28:28.200 --> 28:29.360
[slams table]

28:29.440 --> 28:35.040
I think we've all seen how you act
in your defense.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
[exhales]

28:40.080 --> 28:41.400
Thank you.

28:46.160 --> 28:49.640
...and as a punishment we have
to build a gate together over half-term,

28:49.720 --> 28:53.160
-instead of coming to see you.
-Dr. Hahn telephoned me yesterday.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.680
He's going to keep you
at school over the holidays,

28:55.760 --> 28:58.200
to help you settle. I'm afraid I agreed.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.640
-Are you going to be long?
-Piss off! You did what?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.800
Which leaves me obliged
to fly to the wedding.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.120
But that's in London.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.000
Yes. We're at the airfield now.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.200
[Cecile shouts in German]

29:09.280 --> 29:11.280
-Sorry, but I've got to go.
-[Philip punches wall]

29:11.360 --> 29:14.320
Now you just settle and behave well.
That'll cheer me up.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.400
-[slams phone]
-[boy] Oi!

29:17.480 --> 29:19.040
[phone clatters]

29:22.160 --> 29:23.400
Prick!

29:23.480 --> 29:26.800
[chattering in German]

29:26.880 --> 29:29.680
-[Cecile mutters prayer]
-[men shouting]

29:29.760 --> 29:32.760
-[Don speaks German]
-[Cecile] Yeah.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.760
[engines start up]

29:56.040 --> 29:59.040
[engine continues droning]

30:01.760 --> 30:04.520
[telephone rings]

30:19.440 --> 30:20.840
[Hahn speaks German]

30:40.160 --> 30:41.360
[boy shouts] Philip!

30:42.760 --> 30:43.640
Philip!

30:43.720 --> 30:45.680
-[panting]
-[boy] Hahn wants you!

30:48.240 --> 30:49.920
[straining]

30:50.000 --> 30:51.240
Hurry up!

30:55.720 --> 30:57.800
After takeoff from Cologne,

30:57.880 --> 31:01.400
bad weather meant
they couldn't land at Brussels.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.120
While attempting to land in Ostend...

31:11.920 --> 31:13.000
I'm afraid...

31:18.640 --> 31:20.720
I'm afraid all 12 souls were lost.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.440
Twelve.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.760
Including the four crew.

31:39.520 --> 31:46.360
But with four crew, plus Cecile,
Don, Ludwig and Alexander, that's eight.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.000
[Hahn] Also the Grand Duke's mother,

31:50.360 --> 31:55.200
a nurse, Joachim Freiherr von Riedesel.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.080
[whimpers]

31:59.880 --> 32:00.920
Eleven.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.600
And your sister Cecile must have gone
into labor

32:07.680 --> 32:09.120
on the flight.

32:09.200 --> 32:13.360
A newborn was found in the wreckage.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.680
[shudders]

Sir!

36:40.560 --> 36:41.720
[Hahn] Go home!

36:43.840 --> 36:44.880
Back to the school!

36:46.160 --> 36:47.280
Give me the lantern.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.680
You too.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.840
he milk train will leave Inverness station

36:55.920 --> 36:57.600
at 4:45 tomorrow morning.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.600
You will be on it.

37:02.680 --> 37:07.240
From London, you will fly to Berlin
and then on to Darmstadt with your uncle,

37:07.320 --> 37:12.040
to attend the funeral
of your brother-in-law,

37:12.960 --> 37:16.760
your nephews and your sister.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.640
It will not be easy.

37:21.200 --> 37:25.280
But when you return,
we  will be your family.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.840
This school will be your home.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.240
Now come!

37:33.880 --> 37:34.880
Be strong!

40:22.440 --> 40:23.480
Philip.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.040
Philip.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.080
Go on.

40:32.160 --> 40:34.000
[breathes heavily]

40:34.080 --> 40:35.080
Go on.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.960
[chattering]

40:58.360 --> 41:00.160
Philip, come.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.120
Mama. It's Philip.

41:21.840 --> 41:22.880
Your son.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.520
[Andrew] I'm surprised
he dare show himself here.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.040
Papa!

41:30.120 --> 41:34.440
Had it not been for Philip
and his indiscipline...

41:37.160 --> 41:38.760
she would never have taken that flight.

41:40.040 --> 41:40.960
It's true.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.320
Isn't it, boy?

41:45.880 --> 41:51.720
You're the reason we're all here
burying my favorite child.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.840
-[Sophie] Papa.
-[Andrew] Get him out of here.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.040
You may hate him now,

42:10.400 --> 42:14.000
but one day, God willing,
you will be a father yourself.

42:14.680 --> 42:18.440
And you will fall short,
as all parents do.

42:18.520 --> 42:20.480
And be hated.

42:23.880 --> 42:28.200
And you will know what it is to pray
for the forgiveness from your own son.

42:48.200 --> 42:51.680
[thunder rumbling]

42:56.400 --> 42:59.360
[Jim whispers] Philip.
Where are you going?

43:03.480 --> 43:05.720
[grunts and pants]

43:12.880 --> 43:14.960
[typewriter clacking]

43:25.040 --> 43:26.280
[Philip groans]

43:29.920 --> 43:31.120
[bucket clatters]

43:35.040 --> 43:37.440
[panting and groaning]

43:46.080 --> 43:47.320
Get inside.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.480
[Philip heaving]

44:08.760 --> 44:10.360
I think he needs help, sir.

44:11.520 --> 44:14.680
Not until he's asked for it. Come.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.160
[Philip panting]

44:26.720 --> 44:28.160
[Philip strains]

44:29.320 --> 44:30.480
[Philip groans]

44:33.360 --> 44:35.240
-[boy] Sir?
-[Hahn] Move on!

44:35.320 --> 44:38.360

-[boys whisper]
-He's here.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.920
Help.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.520
[Hahn] Speak up.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.440
[pants]

46:02.520 --> 46:05.520
[voice breaking] I-- I need help.

46:18.480 --> 46:19.880
[Hahn] So...

46:23.000 --> 46:24.040
Now we go.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.720
Boys.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.040
-[chattering]
-Come on, boys.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.040
-Three, two...
-Hands on.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.360
-One.
-Lift up!

46:52.840 --> 46:53.960
-Steady.
-Careful.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.800
Stop. Pull back. Back.

46:57.400 --> 46:58.920
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

47:08.520 --> 47:10.520
[gate squeaks]

47:10.600 --> 47:13.240
[Philip breathes heavily]

47:13.320 --> 47:16.840
Good. Well done, boys.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.360
You too, Philip.

48:24.480 --> 48:28.480
[Tennant]  The challenge ahead is one
that faces every Gordonstounian.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.800
Your route is 18-miles long.

48:31.880 --> 48:33.000
[detective] Torch.

48:33.080 --> 48:34.440
[Tennant] You are Gordonstounians,

48:34.520 --> 48:38.400
and you are expected
to rise to the challenge.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.600
Plus est en vous , gentlemen.
There is more in each of you.

48:42.680 --> 48:43.720
Plus est en vous.

48:44.560 --> 48:45.560
[blows whistle]

48:45.640 --> 48:48.560
-[shouting]
-[cheering]

48:49.360 --> 48:50.400
[boy] Hurry up!

48:50.480 --> 48:52.280
-Go on!
-[Charles] What?

48:52.360 --> 48:53.240
Go on!

48:53.760 --> 48:56.040
[boy] Get a move on, Charlie! Hurry up!

48:56.120 --> 48:58.760
-[boy] Charles!
-[detective] Catch them up! Quick! Go on!

49:02.520 --> 49:05.200
[boys shout]

49:05.280 --> 49:07.160
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

49:07.240 --> 49:10.760
[Charles grunts]

49:12.120 --> 49:14.680
-[boy] Hurry up!
-[Charles pants]

49:20.160 --> 49:23.080
[boy] Just leave it. Keep going.

49:23.960 --> 49:26.440
[cheering]

49:26.520 --> 49:27.760
[car horn honks]

49:30.800 --> 49:33.000
[cheering]

49:35.880 --> 49:38.240
[Hahn] Hello, sir!
It's good to have you back!

49:38.320 --> 49:39.760
It's my absolute pleasure.

49:40.400 --> 49:41.400
How's he doing?

49:41.480 --> 49:45.120
Well... they should all be back
at two o'clock.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.040
[cheering continues]

49:52.600 --> 49:56.280
[cheering]

49:59.440 --> 50:03.600
-[Tennant] Grater. Hadden. Cann.
-[Cann] Sorry, sir.

50:03.680 --> 50:07.480
[Tennant] Never mind.
And Pickering. Griffiths.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.800
-[detective] Is Charles here?
-Let me have a look.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.400
-Where's Charles?
-We lost him, quite early on.

50:15.560 --> 50:18.680
Geddes. Right, everyone,
get changed quick as you can!

50:26.920 --> 50:28.000
[Philip] Thank you.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.440
[cheering]

50:38.960 --> 50:40.960
Mr. Peacock, the head of our studies.

50:41.040 --> 50:43.000
[Philip] How do you do? Good to see you.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.080
[Philip laughs]

50:59.880 --> 51:00.960
Ah!

51:02.200 --> 51:03.880
[Tennant] And finally, Team B.

51:16.640 --> 51:17.800
[Philip clears throat]

51:17.880 --> 51:21.120
Well, I think we should start
the presentation.

51:23.320 --> 51:24.840
Ten more minutes.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.840
Of course.

51:40.120 --> 51:41.200
Charles?

52:07.840 --> 52:09.040
Charles?

52:09.960 --> 52:12.000
[whimpers]

52:15.280 --> 52:16.680
[detective] Charles?

52:20.880 --> 52:23.480
Right! That's it. Let's begin.

52:26.120 --> 52:28.840
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much!

52:29.880 --> 52:31.320
Well, it's a great joy to be here

52:31.400 --> 52:36.240
and a great pleasure to see
so many happy, healthy, handsome faces.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.560
[crowd chuckles]

52:37.640 --> 52:39.360
The Annual Challenge is a unique test.

52:39.440 --> 52:44.280
In completing it, all participants will
have shown great character, stamina,

52:44.360 --> 52:46.200
and most of all...

52:48.960 --> 52:51.560
[boy whispers] It's him. Where's he been?

52:52.680 --> 52:53.680
[Philip clears throat]

52:56.200 --> 52:59.320
...and most of all, courage.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.680
The ethos at Gordonstoun

53:16.680 --> 53:21.760
is to embrace the community
over the individual,

53:22.520 --> 53:25.320
the team over the star.

53:26.440 --> 53:29.760
And so it gives me great pleasure
to present this wonderful trophy,

53:29.840 --> 53:33.040
the Duke of Edinburgh Cup,
to the winning team,

53:33.120 --> 53:36.240
which I believe is Team C.

53:36.320 --> 53:37.800
Led by Simon Harper.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.560
[cheering]

53:42.040 --> 53:44.000
Well, don't just sit there, boy!
Come and collect it!

53:45.280 --> 53:47.560
[Hahn] Congratulations. Good work.

53:47.640 --> 53:49.840
Well done! Good lad! Well done!

54:06.920 --> 54:07.840
[camera shutter clicks]

54:19.640 --> 54:21.240
I want you to know, if you're feeling bad

54:21.320 --> 54:23.600
about where you finished
in that challenge today...

54:24.760 --> 54:26.640
-it's of no consequence to me.
-[rumbling]

54:26.720 --> 54:27.560
[Charles whimpers]

54:29.600 --> 54:32.680
I understand that these sorts of physical
tests don't come naturally to you.

54:32.760 --> 54:35.200
But you showed great courage

54:35.280 --> 54:37.520
-and determination.
-[rumbling]

54:39.280 --> 54:40.880
-[whimpering]
-Don't worry about it.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.280
Whatever shame you may or may not
be feeling, I can assure you

54:46.360 --> 54:49.560
it's nothing compared to the shame I felt
at your age,

54:50.520 --> 54:52.200
over something I did.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.360
-To my favorite sister.
-Oh!

54:57.440 --> 55:02.040
-Cecile. She hated flying.
-[panicked breathing]

55:02.120 --> 55:03.600
Loathed it, terrified of it.

55:03.680 --> 55:08.240
She always dressed in black
when she flew, for her own funeral.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.240
[Charles whimpers]

55:09.320 --> 55:12.680
Anyway, the point is that Kurt Hahn
and that school put me back together,

55:12.760 --> 55:14.320
toughened me up. Charles...

55:14.400 --> 55:16.080
-[exclaims]
-The pain...

55:16.160 --> 55:18.640
-The struggle is a gift, Charles.
-[whimpers]

55:18.720 --> 55:20.360
This is the moment you have to dig deep.

55:20.440 --> 55:23.040
You put the work in now
and you won't struggle in the future.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.920
But you've got to toughen up a little,
boy, for what is ahead of you.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.640
-[exclaims]
-[rumbling]

55:27.720 --> 55:29.240
Don't worry about it! It's just air!

55:31.280 --> 55:32.440
I know there's more in you, Charles.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.600
You've got to be strong,
and you've got to find it.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.080
-[exclaims]
-It's just air!

55:38.160 --> 55:40.200
[indistinct radio chatter]

55:40.960 --> 55:43.480
-[detective] Get him back here!
-Don't be so weak!

55:43.560 --> 55:46.080
[shouts] Don't be so bloody weak!

55:46.160 --> 55:49.480
-[whimpers]
-[detective] Charles, it's all right.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.880
-[shouts] Out! Get out!
-[detective] Charles!

55:53.840 --> 55:55.240
It's all right.

56:02.760 --> 56:04.960
[sobbing]

56:06.560 --> 56:09.960
[man speaking indistinctly over radio]

56:12.880 --> 56:14.880
Winds are picking up...

56:29.640 --> 56:30.840
[Anne] Daddy!

56:32.240 --> 56:33.080
Daddy!

56:34.120 --> 56:35.440
Daddy!

56:36.160 --> 56:38.160
[Philip] Darling Anne!
How's my favorite little girl?

56:46.720 --> 56:47.640
[car door closes]

56:57.000 --> 56:59.960
-[Anne] Faster, Daddy!
-I'm coming, I'm coming!

57:00.040 --> 57:01.760
[Anne and Philip laugh]

57:16.080 --> 57:17.080
[Charles] Thank you.

57:17.160 --> 57:20.840
[nanny] You must be hungry.
Like me to make you a sandwich?

57:20.920 --> 57:23.200
[Charles] Yes, please. Hello, Martin!

57:24.240 --> 57:26.640
[chattering]

57:40.800 --> 57:44.120
[choir singing]
