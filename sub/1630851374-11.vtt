04:34.107 --> 04:36.192
Well, who do you think
wanted Jennifer dead?

04:36.234 --> 04:37.485
Because I happen to think
her brother

04:37.527 --> 04:38.486
had something to do with it.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.154
And why's that?

04:40.196 --> 04:42.865
He was supposed to pick her up
on the day she went missing,

04:42.907 --> 04:44.993
and no one knows
why he never showed.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.704
No one's heard
from him in years.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.706
And then, a few months ago,
he sold her identity.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.668
Wait, her brother
sold her identity?
Yeah.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.169
And we need you
to help us find him,

04:55.211 --> 04:57.297

that was after Jennifer,

04:57.338 --> 04:59.632

that's after my friend.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.535
But her own brother?

10:19.577 --> 10:22.204
You honestly think
that her brother

10:22.246 --> 10:23.706
snuck out
of that facility,

10:23.748 --> 10:26.125
kidnapped Jess,
thinking it was his sister,

10:26.167 --> 10:28.252
and never
recognized her?

10:31.589 --> 10:35.676
Look, it's obvious
what you're doing.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.595
I used to work
in missing persons.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.722
I have seen countless people
grasping at straws

10:39.764 --> 10:41.599
because they didn't want
to deal with the truth.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.601
No. Don't say that.
And... and the truth is

10:43.643 --> 10:45.186
that Jess is dead.
Shut up. Shut up.

10:45.227 --> 10:49.106
I'm sorry.
I know it's horrible.
Shut up! Shut up!

10:51.067 --> 10:53.402
You don't know that!

10:53.444 --> 10:55.780
You don't know anything!

10:59.659 --> 11:02.411
You don't know that.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.039
So shut up.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.420
TREY:
Okay.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.964
Let's just... go to this place.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.149
Hey, Sarah, it's Darnell.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.366
(sighs)

11:54.672 --> 11:56.757
(sighs)

12:07.226 --> 12:09.311
TREY:
Okay.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.897
We're here.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.150
All right, I'm gonna
let Pretzel pee before we go in.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.694
Be right back.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.949
Come on, buddy.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.660
(sighs)

12:29.331 --> 12:31.333
Can I ask you something?

12:31.375 --> 12:32.918
Sure.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.212
Why are you doing this?

12:36.964 --> 12:39.300
For a couple weeks of sex?

12:40.342 --> 12:44.138
'Cause I guarantee
that's all you're getting.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.183
Look,

12:47.224 --> 12:49.685
I know you're wanted
in this triple homicide.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.729
Darnell says you didn't do it,

12:51.771 --> 12:54.148
and I don't think
he'd lie to me.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.485
If your cell phone ends up being
the only evidence against you,

12:57.526 --> 13:00.279
there's no way
that'll hold up.
What's your point?

13:00.321 --> 13:01.864
My point is
that you've just added

13:01.906 --> 13:04.575
kidnapping a police officer
to that list.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.660
Look at what
Darnell did for you,

13:06.702 --> 13:08.662
and this is how
you repay him?

13:08.704 --> 13:11.415
Well, what's done is done.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.834
Actually, if you just, uh...
(banging on door)

13:13.876 --> 13:16.003
Let's go!

13:16.921 --> 13:18.756
All right.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.801
I'm gonna uncuff you.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.386
Don't try anything.

13:28.974 --> 13:32.561
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
talk to you guys.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.730
We just want to ask you
a couple of questions about...

13:34.772 --> 13:36.899
My sister? No.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.235
No, I'm not doing this.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.946
Patrick, we're not
accusing you of anything.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.365
We just want to see
if we can dig up anything

13:44.406 --> 13:45.783
that the police
missed back then.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.578
Well, then you can listen

13:49.620 --> 13:51.747
to my 47-hour interrogation

13:51.789 --> 13:53.749
the week she went missing.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.918
I told the cops everything
they needed to know, okay?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.128
An interrogation from back
then wouldn't explain why

13:58.170 --> 14:01.173
you sold your sister's
identity three months ago.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.259
Hmm?

14:06.136 --> 14:08.055
Hmm?

14:09.640 --> 14:12.101
Because I'm a drug addict.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.396
I needed money.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.023
So I sold
my missing sister's identity

14:18.065 --> 14:19.984
for a dime bag of heroin.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.819
Yeah?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.404
Hmm.
Yeah.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.072
SARAH:
Who did you sell

14:25.114 --> 14:26.699
her identity to?

14:26.740 --> 14:28.284
I don't remember.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.536
Some lady.
I was on a four-day bender,

14:30.578 --> 14:32.329
so I don't really
remember much.

14:32.371 --> 14:35.291
Look, look, talking about
this stuff isn't great for me,

14:35.332 --> 14:37.293
so I'm just gonna
go back to my room

14:37.334 --> 14:38.711
if you... if you don't mind.

14:38.752 --> 14:41.255
Sure. Thank you.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.258
No. Hang on.
You wait a second.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.802
I told you, I already did this!

14:48.304 --> 14:50.389
I'm not doing it again!

14:51.307 --> 14:53.350
I don't believe a word you say.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.270
I can't express
how little I care.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.991
Great job in there,
by the way.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.743
Thanks for scaring off
our prime suspect.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.661
Prime suspect?

15:12.703 --> 15:14.496
Poor guy is just an addict.
I'm telling you,

15:14.538 --> 15:16.040
he had something
to do with this.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.541
(Sarah scoffs)
Okay, he was lying.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.335
Could hear it in his voice.
He's lying!

15:19.376 --> 15:21.629
Been doing this for a long
time, Murphy. He wasn't lying.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.839
Trey.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.841
Um...

15:25.883 --> 15:28.177
he seemed like he
was telling the truth.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.929
No, he was not.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.805
(laughing):
No, you guys are both wrong.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.390
You guys are both wrong.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.101
He's-he's...
he's hiding something, okay?

15:36.143 --> 15:38.771
I bet my life on it.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.856
Well, I did what you asked.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.232
Wait. He said
he was interrogated

15:42.274 --> 15:43.901
for two days back then.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.611
Let's listen to it,
see if I'm right.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.488
If you were right, they would
have never let him go.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.865
(laughs)
Yeah, sure.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.326
Because the cops in your
department are really top notch.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.079
(stammering):
We're not even arguing
about this, okay?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.498
I don't... Just shut up.
You-you have no say here.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.960
SARAH:
Are you seriously
thinking of taking me

16:01.001 --> 16:03.253
to the police station?
You're that dumb?

16:03.295 --> 16:05.506
MURPHY:
I have gotten closer to solving

16:05.547 --> 16:09.551
this case in three days than
the police have in ten years.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.553
(laughing):
Okay, you're not close

16:11.595 --> 16:13.263
to solving anything, Murphy.
You're delusional.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.557
Hmm. I've been called
that before, and yet,

16:15.599 --> 16:18.227
I've been right
every single time,

16:18.268 --> 16:20.270
so don't underestimate me.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.523
Ooh. (sniffles)

16:23.899 --> 16:25.943
Let's go, Trey.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.445
(sighs)

16:28.487 --> 16:30.656
What are you doing?
Let's go.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.866
(engine starts)

16:39.581 --> 16:41.667
♪ ♪

16:49.800 --> 16:51.760
MURPHY:
We'll be able
to hear everything.

16:51.802 --> 16:56.724
Okay? If you tell anyone what's
going on, you turn off the phone

16:56.765 --> 17:00.102
or mute or anything,
we'll send those texts.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.895
You remember what they are,
or did you want us

17:01.937 --> 17:03.105
to just refresh your memory
real quick?

17:03.147 --> 17:04.690
I got it.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.401
TREY:
Put this in your pocket.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.113
MURPHY:
Just go inside,

17:11.155 --> 17:13.615
get the evidence,
come back outside.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.743
Don't talk to anyone.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.592
Sarah?
Hey.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.344
What are you...
what are you doing here?

17:41.477 --> 17:42.519
JOSH:
It's the middle of the night.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.188
What's going on?

17:44.229 --> 17:46.106
SARAH:
Oh, I, um... I couldn't sleep.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.941
I just, uh...

17:47.983 --> 17:50.736
I came to grab some files

17:50.778 --> 17:52.821
to get some work done. You?

17:52.863 --> 17:55.282
Well, I went home and started
watching Jeopardy!, and I...

17:55.324 --> 17:58.160
I was like, "How can I be
watching a six-year-old episode

17:58.202 --> 17:59.870
of Jeopardy!
when Murphy's still out there?"

17:59.912 --> 18:02.623
Yeah, I know. I get it.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.709
No, you don't get it.
No, you don't get it.

18:05.751 --> 18:09.213
I literally had her
in that interrogation room.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.049
I-I had her in her apartment.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.134
I literally had her
in my... my bed,

18:14.176 --> 18:19.056
right beside me, and I let her
get away each and every time.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.641
This is pointless.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.309
I'm gonna go brew up some coffee
and sober up.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.104
No. Wait a second.
(scoffs)

18:25.145 --> 18:28.273
Yeah?
Look, can I ask you...?

18:32.194 --> 18:34.696
What is it about her?

18:34.738 --> 18:36.657
JOSH:
What do you mean?

18:36.698 --> 18:38.826
SARAH:
I mean... Murphy.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.577
You're obviously a smart guy.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.122
You have been
after Nia Bailey for years,

18:43.163 --> 18:45.791
but you let this girl

18:45.833 --> 18:47.292
get in your way.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.877
Well, thank you.
Just... (laughs)

18:48.919 --> 18:51.672
...continue to kick me
while I'm down, please.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.174
SARAH:
Come on. I'm serious.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.593
How did she do it?

18:58.595 --> 19:00.764
I don't know, honestly.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.600
I think about it
literally all the time--

19:03.642 --> 19:07.271
how she just made me...

19:07.312 --> 19:09.773
she just made me so stupid.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.734
You know,
and she-she has this...

19:12.776 --> 19:14.736
(sighs)

19:14.778 --> 19:17.698
Well, she's just
such a dick, you know?

19:19.658 --> 19:22.286
(sighs)
She hates everyone.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.330
So, you know,
when she chooses you,

19:25.372 --> 19:27.416
it makes you feel
really special.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.588
SARAH: But you think
it was all just manipulation?

19:32.629 --> 19:35.382
(Josh scoffs)

19:35.424 --> 19:37.593
JOSH:
Every word.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.430
SARAH:
I'm sorry.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.100
Anyway, look,

19:45.142 --> 19:46.643
I'm gonna finish up here.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.645
No use crying about the past.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.940
Yeah. I'm gonna head home, too.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.734
(clears throat)

19:53.775 --> 19:56.612
Get some sleep.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.614
I wish I could.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.991
Night.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.826
Night.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.081
(clears throat)

20:12.920 --> 20:15.047
You do see what she's trying
to do, though, right?

20:15.088 --> 20:17.049
She's trying
to turn you against me.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.886
She's trying to paint me
as some sort of manipulative...

20:20.928 --> 20:22.346
No, I know.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.473
I'm not an idiot.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.393
I do like you, though.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.270
You know that.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.107
Yeah.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.863
Yeah. I'm... Yeah.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.865
WOMAN:
Detective Barnes, working late?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.492
SARAH:
Yeah, something like that.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.827
Can I get the evidence box
for case number 43...

20:45.869 --> 20:49.831
8321? Jennifer Walker. Thanks.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.921
(clears throat)

21:08.558 --> 21:09.810
Got it.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.937
Yeah, we heard.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.649
(whispers):
Bitch.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.902
(engine starts)

21:29.746 --> 21:31.206
Can you guys
hurry up?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.333
There's a lot
of stuff in here.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.169
Found it.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.172
Oh, he wasn't kidding.
This is long.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.143
MILLER:
Can you state your name
for the record, please.

21:51.184 --> 21:54.479
(clears throat)
Patrick Walker.

21:54.521 --> 21:57.024
Look, I have, uh,

21:57.065 --> 21:59.735
no idea where my sister is.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.363
Can I see my mom, please?

22:03.405 --> 22:05.115
MILLER:
Yeah, in a bit. We're just gonna
ask you a couple questions.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.159
You need anything?
You comfortable?

22:07.200 --> 22:09.536
You want some water?
You said this thing was,
like, two days long.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.204
We don't have time to sit here
and listen to the whole thing.
SARAH: Hang on.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.498
Transcript's notated.
We usually

22:13.540 --> 22:15.083
mark important points up
to find later.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.961
47 hours,
23 minutes.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.380
(sighs)

22:25.302 --> 22:27.137
Please. Please,
just-just

22:27.179 --> 22:28.847
let me talk to my mom.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.391
Oh, for the last time, you can
see your mom once you tell us

22:31.433 --> 22:34.019
why you were late picking up
your sister from swim practice

22:34.061 --> 22:35.437
on Saturday.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.647
I told you.
I don't remember.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.942
You don't remember where you
were three frickin' days ago?!

22:40.984 --> 22:43.111
PATRICK: I-I'm sorry.
MILLER: For killing your sister?

22:43.153 --> 22:45.322
PATRICK:
No! No! I-I didn't! I-I w...

22:45.364 --> 22:47.449
I would never.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.242
I just want my mom.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.702
The second
you tell me the truth

22:50.744 --> 22:53.538
you can see her.
Okay?

22:56.666 --> 23:00.295
(sighs)
I was taking the SATs.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.589
Excuse me?

23:02.631 --> 23:04.716
I was taking...

23:04.758 --> 23:06.843
the SATs.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.012
(Miller laughs)

23:09.054 --> 23:10.806
Come on.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.182
PATRICK:
For this guy at school.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.059
I took the test for him.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.728
It's how I've been saving up
money for Northwestern.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.188
They gave me a scholarship,

23:18.230 --> 23:19.648
but it'll only
pay for half.

23:19.689 --> 23:22.275
And these rich kids
pay me, like, $1,000

23:22.317 --> 23:23.902
to do it for them.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.154
I know it's wrong,

23:26.196 --> 23:27.906
but I just really
needed the money.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.409
And this is why you were late
picking up your sister?

23:30.450 --> 23:32.244
Yeah.

23:32.285 --> 23:35.163
I usually finish the last
section, like, 20 minutes early,

23:35.205 --> 23:36.998
so I thought
I'd have enough time.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.001
But there was this
one word problem.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.878
I couldn't figure it out.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.755
So I tried it again.

23:43.797 --> 23:46.466
And again and again
and again and...

23:46.508 --> 23:48.385
I just figured Jenny would
wait for me, you know?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.554
(crying)

23:52.806 --> 23:54.641
I...
(sniffles)

23:54.683 --> 23:56.393
I had a decimal
in the wrong place.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.271
That's what was wrong.
A decimal.

23:59.312 --> 24:02.524
And because of that...

24:02.566 --> 24:05.610
I didn't get
to her in time.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.112
And now...

24:07.154 --> 24:09.239
(crying)

24:11.032 --> 24:13.243
Thank you, Patrick.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.412
Turn it off.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.539
Let's check his story.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.876
There you go.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.295
You figured out
his big secret, Murphy.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.098
No. No, no. There's got to be
something else. Come on.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.975
There isn't.
They reported the SAT fraud

24:37.017 --> 24:38.894
and Northwestern
rescinded his acceptance.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.354
I'm guessing that's when
his drug addiction started.

24:41.396 --> 24:42.814
SARAH:
He probably blames
himself for everything.

24:42.856 --> 24:45.066
I bet his mom does, too.
No, but, like, that's...

24:45.108 --> 24:46.443
(sighs)
That's it?

24:46.485 --> 24:47.694
Yeah.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.696
MURPHY:
That's... (sighs)

24:49.738 --> 24:52.449
Uh, where's the-the...
the box?

24:52.491 --> 24:54.493
What?
The-the evidence box.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.289
I told you,
there's nothing in there.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.625
This case is a dead end.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.543
Can you please
just let me go now?

25:03.585 --> 25:05.212
No!

25:05.253 --> 25:07.714
I'm keeping you until
you help me find my friend.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.132
There's got to be something
on someone.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.427
There's got to be
something a cop missed.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.429
(papers rustling)

25:14.471 --> 25:16.473
Well, I have to pee.

25:16.515 --> 25:20.393
I'm sure Trey
has to escort me, so...

25:38.078 --> 25:40.455
What are you doing?

25:40.497 --> 25:43.124
I don't have to
go to the bathroom.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.710
Look, I know that you think
what Murphy's doing is crazy,

25:45.752 --> 25:47.546
because it is.

25:49.005 --> 25:52.551
Look, I'm just trying
to help her find her friend.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.636
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.805
Yeah, but come on.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.473
What are you gonna do--

25:58.515 --> 26:00.350
keep chasing dumb
clue after dumb clue,

26:00.392 --> 26:02.477
just to... what?

26:02.519 --> 26:05.605
(chuckles softly)
Make her happy?

26:05.647 --> 26:08.525
No one is ever
gonna make that girl happy.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.569
Including you.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.654
I know you heard Josh.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.656
She makes men stupid.

26:14.698 --> 26:15.865
Look at you.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.909
You're being an
idiot right now.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.869
I know that she's making you
think that you're different,

26:19.911 --> 26:21.955
that you're special,
that... you know.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.666
But you're not special, you're
just like the rest of them.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.334
She uses people.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.877
That's what she does.

26:27.919 --> 26:31.006
Look at what she made
you do to Darnell.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.260
Look, if you delete the texts
and let me walk,

26:35.302 --> 26:38.138
I will not tell anyone
what happened here tonight.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.060
Let's just go back in there.

26:44.102 --> 26:46.062
Hmm?
(scoffs)

26:46.104 --> 26:47.814
Let's go.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.983
Don't touch me.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.153
(plastic crinkling)
(scanner beeps)

26:57.574 --> 26:59.159
What are these?

27:00.410 --> 27:02.370
Uh, looks like a bracelet

27:02.412 --> 27:04.623
and a bunch of beads
to make a bracelet.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.041
Are they the same?

27:06.082 --> 27:08.001
Like, are the-are the
loose beads

27:08.043 --> 27:10.253
the same as the beads
on the bracelet?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.214
Yeah.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.549
MURPHY:
They are?

27:14.591 --> 27:17.802
(laughs)

27:17.844 --> 27:20.096
Oh, my God. Okay.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.182
Yeah, I know exactly where
we need to go next.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.808
Like, now.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.769
Right now.
'Cause of a bunch of beads?

27:25.810 --> 27:27.270
Yes, because of a bunch
of beads.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.565
Yes. Just trust me
on this.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.567
All right, uh...

27:32.609 --> 27:35.820
I'll get all this back
in the box and...

27:35.862 --> 27:37.739
meet you in the car.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.074
You know where it is?

27:39.115 --> 27:40.575
MURPHY:
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, okay.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.535
Come on, Pretzel.
Come on.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.704
Find outside. (sighs)

27:47.707 --> 27:50.835
Good boy.
Okay.

27:50.877 --> 27:53.838
(door closing)

27:55.173 --> 27:56.841
All right, fine.

27:56.883 --> 28:00.095
I'll take it--
that deal you offered me.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.891
(phone camera clicks)
What are you doing?

28:04.933 --> 28:07.727
Sending myself a screenshot.
If in one hour,

28:07.769 --> 28:10.563
the cops aren't after us,
I'll delete it.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.150
What? I'm just

28:14.192 --> 28:15.902
supposed to trust you now?

28:16.861 --> 28:18.947
Yeah.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.619
Here.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.996
No cops.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.458
And you don't come after me.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.378
Deal.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.423
All right.

28:43.596 --> 28:44.973
(door closes)

28:45.014 --> 28:47.100
Don't underestimate me.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.568
MURPHY:
Okay, we're going

28:56.609 --> 28:59.654
to 29 Sumner Avenue
in South Bend.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.991
That's, uh, Jennifer's
best friend's house.

29:03.032 --> 29:05.952
And I know you guys think
these are just some beads,

29:05.994 --> 29:07.662
but they're actually
friendship bracelets,

29:07.704 --> 29:09.038
and one of them
was broken.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.832
One of them was,
like, ripped off.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.917
I can feel the...
the thread.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.502
And Jennifer's mom told me

29:14.544 --> 29:17.839
that she only really
had one friend-- Susannah.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.174
So the day she goes missing,

29:19.215 --> 29:21.342
she rips off
her friendship bracelet?

29:21.384 --> 29:23.803
Sarah, that is something

29:23.845 --> 29:26.139
that even you have to admit
is a little sketchy.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.057
It's...
That's something.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.687
Hello? Sarah?

29:32.729 --> 29:34.063
I let her go.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.525
You... you let her go?

29:37.567 --> 29:39.569
What?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.154
We need her.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.740
She can... she can
interrogate people, she can

29:43.782 --> 29:46.242
subpoena whatever...
There's no one to
interrogate, Murphy.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.328
There's nothing
to subpoena.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.330
This is nothing.
Don't say that.

29:50.371 --> 29:54.959
Look, she gave me a way
out and I... I took it.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.047
I just kidnapped
a cop,

29:59.088 --> 30:01.508
who also happens to
be Darnell's girl.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.427
I kidnapped a cop

30:04.469 --> 30:06.095
when I'm wanted

30:06.137 --> 30:07.597
for three murders
that I didn't even commit.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.932
And I did all of that
because of you.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.391
I didn't force you
to do anything.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.602
No, you didn't, but...

30:12.644 --> 30:16.064
you make me stupid, Murphy.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.607
I got to walk.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.359
Trey.
Come on, Murphy.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.069
You might think you like me,

30:21.110 --> 30:22.946
but I'm just the only person
you have left.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.322
That's not...

30:24.364 --> 30:27.992
That's not even close
to the truth.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.870
Okay.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.789
Whatever.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.293
Believe whatever you want.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.962
(sighs)

30:40.964 --> 30:43.716
I'll drop you off
at the bus station.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.718
You can get to South
Bend from there.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.680
(laughs)
Sorry. I'm just still moved

30:48.721 --> 30:51.432
by you telling me yesterday
that you weren't going anywhere.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.438
Yeah, well...

30:58.439 --> 31:00.525
Things change, right?

31:04.571 --> 31:06.739
I guess they do.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.244
Can you just drive me
to Lesley's, please?

31:14.664 --> 31:16.708
(exhales softly)

31:16.749 --> 31:18.167
Hey, there you are.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.419
Are you okay?

31:19.460 --> 31:21.462
Get the hell away from me.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.006
What?

31:23.047 --> 31:24.424
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What-what happened to you?

31:24.465 --> 31:25.967
What happened to me?

31:26.009 --> 31:27.802
I went to your place,
only to have your friends

31:27.844 --> 31:31.055
hold me hostage all night,
using our texts as blackmail.

31:31.097 --> 31:34.267
Wait, what? Murphy and Trey?
Can you just leave me alone?

31:34.309 --> 31:36.394
I had no ide...

I did, too.

35:56.904 --> 36:00.491
Do you remember when we finally
decided to take them off?

36:00.533 --> 36:02.243
Yeah, when we turned 16

36:02.285 --> 36:03.995
'cause I thought they made us
look like little girls.

36:04.036 --> 36:05.580
(chuckles softly)

36:05.621 --> 36:07.582
We were little girls.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.210
I just know
that this stupid bracelet

36:11.252 --> 36:12.712
means something.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.505
I really need to find a way
to get to South Bend.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.507
Like, imagine the fight
that we would have had to get in

36:16.549 --> 36:19.093
for one of us to rip ours off.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.679
Which means...

36:23.556 --> 36:26.100
...Susannah
definitely murdered her.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.476
Jess. Come on.
Case closed.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.228
Oh, no, yes, I'm sorry.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.063
She almost murdered her,

36:31.105 --> 36:33.149
because she now thinks
I'm Jennifer,

36:33.191 --> 36:35.193
and she's trying
to finish the job.

36:35.234 --> 36:37.403
Please don't start talking
to me like I'm crazy, too.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.198
I didn't say anything.
I literally

36:40.239 --> 36:42.617
have no one. I've lost
every single person in my life,

36:42.658 --> 36:44.744
so please be nice to me.
(exhales)

36:44.785 --> 36:46.245
Do you realize
that you're asking

36:46.287 --> 36:48.247
a figment of your imagination

36:48.289 --> 36:51.083
to be nice to you?

36:57.048 --> 37:00.092
I was always so eager
to grow up.

37:02.011 --> 37:04.096
And for what?

37:06.349 --> 37:08.184
Come on.

37:09.185 --> 37:12.104
Trey wasn't your guy.

37:14.857 --> 37:19.070
If he was, he would have never,
ever let you go.

37:22.615 --> 37:25.701
I mean that.
No matter what, okay?

37:27.286 --> 37:29.497
I don't think

37:29.538 --> 37:32.250
Max would have ever
done that to you

37:32.291 --> 37:34.502
when you guys were together.

37:34.543 --> 37:37.546
You might have done that to him,

37:37.588 --> 37:40.049
but I think...
(chuckles)
Shut up.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.134
That goes unsaid.

37:48.057 --> 37:50.559
I love you.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.020
I know.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.900

Hi.

38:47.616 --> 38:49.368
Hi.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.997
(exhales)
I have coffee.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.790
Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.
Yeah.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.917
Yeah, of course.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.255
Oh, boy. What time is it?

39:01.297 --> 39:04.967
Oh, it's, uh, 11:15.
What?

39:05.009 --> 39:06.761
Uh, 11... Oh, God.

39:06.802 --> 39:09.055
Is everything o-okay, or...?

39:09.096 --> 39:11.390
Can you hold this, please? I was
supposed to visit my mom today.
Yeah, I got it.

39:11.432 --> 39:14.935
She's sick. And my, you know,
my-my sister was gonna take me.

39:14.977 --> 39:16.437
She was gonna pick me up
at 10:30.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.647
Hang on. Oh, God.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.107
Yeah, she left
me a voice mail.

39:20.149 --> 39:21.901
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Your car insurance warranty

39:21.942 --> 39:24.362
is about to expire.
Yep. That bitch
left without me.

39:24.403 --> 39:26.364
Oh, God. My mom's
gonna kill me.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.032
Okay, um... It's okay.
Oh, no.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.368
This is bad.
Where-where does your mom live?

39:30.409 --> 39:32.703
I can just drive you.
Oh, no.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.205
She lives in South Bend.

39:34.246 --> 39:37.124
I mean, that's, like,
two hours away.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.502
I couldn't ask you
to do that and...

39:39.543 --> 39:42.046
Uh, Pretzel! Come here.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.465
I'll just probably take
a cab or something.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.092
No, you're not taking a cab
two hours away.

39:46.133 --> 39:47.843
Seriously, I can drive you.

39:48.844 --> 39:51.138
I don't know, are you sure?
I-I feel really bad

39:51.180 --> 39:53.766
asking you to do that.
No. No, it's nothing.
For real.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.476
Really?
Yeah.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.311
I wish that I could say
I have a bunch of cool stuff

39:57.353 --> 39:58.729
to cancel today, but...
(chuckles)

39:58.771 --> 40:00.523
...all you're doing
is taking four hours away

40:00.564 --> 40:02.191
from watching Lost
for the millionth time.
Lost?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.484
Yeah.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.194
Wow.
You know it?

40:05.236 --> 40:07.655
Cancel everything.
Okay.

40:07.696 --> 40:10.658
Shut up, first of all.
(laughs)

40:10.699 --> 40:12.034
You're sweet.

40:21.794 --> 40:23.421
This is it, I think.

40:23.462 --> 40:24.839
Red brick?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.632
Uh, no idea.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.509
Right.
(chuckles)

40:28.551 --> 40:30.678
My bad.
It's all right.

40:31.637 --> 40:34.181
Hey, we're still on
for dinner Thursday?

40:34.223 --> 40:36.183
Oh, yeah. Totally, yeah.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.394
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.729
Great. Just text me.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.022
I will.
Okay.

40:42.064 --> 40:43.524
(chuckles)
Thank you again so much.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.152
Yeah.
I really...
I really appreciate it.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.487
Yeah.
Okay.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.698
Just...
Just, uh, right there.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.324
Got it. Got it, got it.
Okay.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.160
Okay.
All right.

40:54.201 --> 40:56.036
All right.
I-I'll give you a hand.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.122
No. No, it's all good.
I... You're sure?

40:58.164 --> 40:59.498
Yeah, I can take off.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.709
Oh...
All right, I... You're sure?

41:01.750 --> 41:04.170
I'm good. Come on, Pretzel.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.228
Find inside.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.863
(knock on door)

41:35.242 --> 41:36.619
Oh.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.330
Hi there.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.209
Does one of these belong to you?

41:48.130 --> 41:50.174
I can explain.

41:51.133 --> 41:53.302
(shakily):
I'm sorry.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.554
I'm so, so sorry.
