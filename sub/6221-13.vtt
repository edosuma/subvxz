DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:10.261
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.428 --> 00:13.264
His name, Merlin.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.621
Merlin! Spear.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.961
Do you have any
natural gifts, Merlin?

00:44.086 --> 00:45.963
No. Let me think.

00:47.590 --> 00:49.550
I'm not naturally
rude or insensitive.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.803
Just naturally irritating.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.393
(ANIMAL GRUNTING)

01:05.983 --> 01:08.236
It's probably
more scared of you than you are of it.

(GROWLING)

01:21.290 --> 01:22.500
(ROARING)

01:54.031 --> 01:55.950
-Have we lost it?
-Who's missing?

01:57.868 --> 01:59.370
Where's Sir Bedivere?

01:59.704 --> 02:01.038
(SIR BEDIVERE SCREAMING)

02:39.493 --> 02:43.789
The creature you describe has all the
characteristics of the Questing Beast.

02:43.873 --> 02:46.459
-Surely that's a myth.
-According to the old books

02:46.542 --> 02:48.336
the appearance of
the Questing Beast

02:48.419 --> 02:51.589
is supposed to foreshadow
a time of great upheaval.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.425
Gaius,
that's an old wives' tale.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.969
Look, whatever it is,
it is spreading panic.

02:57.053 --> 02:59.263
The people fear
that it will enter the city.

02:59.347 --> 03:02.600
Then we must Kill it.
Arthur, gather the guard together,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.185
you ride at dawn.

03:11.484 --> 03:15.488
| beg you, Sire, do not dismiss
this. The beast is an omen.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.323
| have seen it come before,

03:17.406 --> 03:19.992
the night your wife, Ygraine,
passed away.

03:20.076 --> 03:23.162
I've told you not to speak
of that night again.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.122
| have conquered
the Old Religion.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.125
Its warnings mean
nothing to me now.

03:31.504 --> 03:34.965
Arthur will destroy this beast
and we no longer suffer at its hand.

03:40.096 --> 03:43.808
-This is no ordinary beast, Merlin.
-Don't worry.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.060
No, listen to me.
You don't understand.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.814
Uther may not respect the Old Religion,
but it is very real.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.234
To face a beast such as this
you must understand where it came from.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.195
-What do you mean?
-At the very heart of the Old Religion

03:56.278 --> 03:59.281
lies the magic of life
and death itself.

03:59.365 --> 04:02.660
The Questing Beast
carries that power.

04:02.743 --> 04:07.540
One bite, you die,
and there is no cure.

-No! No!
-It's me, it's Gwen! Stop it.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.479
It was just another dream.

04:34.191 --> 04:37.278
-(SOBBING) It was terrifying.
-It's all right.

04:39.488 --> 04:44.034
You've seen the foe we face.
It is a creature of nightmare.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.537
But you are the best knights
in the realm.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.457
We can and we will kill it

04:49.540 --> 04:52.293
before it harms
another citizen of our kingdom.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.851
-Morgana, what are you doing?
-You cannot face it.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.147
Morgana, go back to bed.
There is nothing to be afraid of.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.942
Please, Arthur, I have seen
terrible things, you cannot go...

05:17.026 --> 05:19.445
She probably had a bad dream, Sire.
I'll take her to see Gaius.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.697
No, I will not let you go.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.782
-Please, Merlin, get her inside.
-No!

05:24.575 --> 05:26.911
| will make sure
he is safe, my lady. I promise.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.789

It didn't bite you, did it?

08:04.485 --> 08:05.819
Arthur!

08:06.945 --> 08:08.530
Somebody help me!

08:08.614 --> 08:09.740
(ECHOING)

08:13.410 --> 08:14.912
What's happened?

08:16.163 --> 08:19.291
-He's been bitten.
- I tried to save him.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.793
You must tell the King.

08:21.794 --> 08:24.505
-There must be something you can do.
- I wish there was.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.757
-I'll find a cure.
-Merlin.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.133
Trust me.

Can you hear me, Sire?

08:33.263 --> 08:35.640
-Here.
-The King will be here any moment.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.519
He can't die.
It is my destiny to protect him.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.022
We haven't done all the things
we're meant to do!

08:42.438 --> 08:47.111
-That is the lament of all men.
-Gaius, he's my friend.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.364
Then save him.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.455
(CHANTING)

09:04.128 --> 09:05.337
(CHANTING)

09:09.299 --> 09:11.635
Maybe the spells need time
to take effect.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.179
The bite of the Questing Beast
is a death sentence...

09:14.304 --> 09:16.181
-UTHER: Where is the prince?
-That no magic can overturn.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.808
Where's my son?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.810
Arthur!

09:24.314 --> 09:27.067
-Do something, Gaius.
-I am trying, Your Majesty.

09:27.151 --> 09:29.361
Gaius will find a cure.
He will not let him die.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.322
| will do
everything in my power.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.491
| will bear him
to his chambers.

10:51.068 --> 10:55.280
| have failed Arthur,
failed in my destiny.

10:55.906 --> 10:58.575
And yet you would not be here
if that were true.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.454
He was bitten by
the Questing Beast. He's going to die.

11:02.579 --> 11:06.375
-Does he still breathe?
-Only just.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.919
Then there is
still time to heal him.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.880
I've tried, I cannot save him.

11:11.964 --> 11:15.217
You do not know
how to save him.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.429
-But you can tell me how?
-Perhaps.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.642
-It will not be easy.
- I will do anything.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.937
-Anything?
-Please, just tell me what I have to do!

11:27.729 --> 11:29.064
Very well.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.109
The Questing Beast
is a creature

11:32.234 --> 11:35.737
conjured by the powers
of the Old Religion.

11:35.946 --> 11:39.616
You must use the same
ancient magic to save him.

11:40.284 --> 11:42.411
The Old Religion died out
centuries ago.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.956
The Old Religion
is the magic of the earth itself.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.334
It is the essence
which binds all things together.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.754
It will last long beyond
the time of men.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.382
But how can that
help me save Arthur?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.634
You must find those
who still serve it.

11:58.802 --> 12:02.764
Those who hold dominion
over life and death.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.101
-Where?
-Go to the place

12:06.184 --> 12:08.937
that men call
the Isle of the Blessed

12:09.021 --> 12:12.691
where the power
of the ancients can still be felt.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.987
There you will discover
Arthur's salvation.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.367
Thank you. Thank you.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.578
And, Merlin.

12:24.661 --> 12:29.833
The young Pendragon must live,
no matter what the cost.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.927
Merlin. You're back.
| need your help.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.930
You must get this to Arthur
to ease his passing.

12:43.013 --> 12:46.558
-No. We have to save him.
-You've already tried.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.853
The beast comes from the Old Religion,
the cure must come from there as well.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.772
There are not many left
with such an art.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.732
You said yourself
the Old Religion is still alive.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.734
There's an island
beyond the white mountains...

12:55.859 --> 12:56.985
No!

12:58.862 --> 13:01.198
The Isle of the Blessed.
You know it?

13:03.867 --> 13:06.536
It was said to be the center
of the Old Religion,

13:06.662 --> 13:09.790
-the focus of its power.
-Why did you keep this from me?

13:09.873 --> 13:11.959
Because it was too dangerous,
Merlin.

13:12.042 --> 13:16.254
It's our only chance.
| have to find it.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.215
And once you are there,
what will you ask?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.841
For Arthur to be saved.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.594
The Questing Beast chose Arthur.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.055
That means the Old Religion
has decided his fate.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.265
Then I will convince them
to change their minds.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.226
It is not that simple!

13:34.523 --> 13:37.442
The high priests have the
power to mirror life and death.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.487
But, there will be a price to pay.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.574
They will demand a life in return.

13:46.368 --> 13:51.456
Merlin, please, I beg of you.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.626
I'm sorry, Gaius.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.422
Whatever the price is,
| will pay it gladly.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.114
Here, you will need a map.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.951
And I'm going
to give you this.

14:30.454 --> 14:31.913
My mother gave it to me.

14:35.083 --> 14:39.629
-It's a rabbit's foot.
-To keep you safe?

14:39.755 --> 14:42.174
It was said to
help protect you from evil spirits.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.510
It's rubbish.
| don't believe in superstition.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.763
-I don't know why I gave it to you.
-No.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.598
| want it.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.435
Thank you.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.190
You've got to
keep Arthur alive until I get back.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.473
-Whose life did you bargain?
-We don't have time.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.101
-Merlin!
-Don't worry, Gaius,

23:13.184 --> 23:14.978
everything's
going to be all right.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.575
What are you doing, physician?

23:29.200 --> 23:32.078
-What are you giving him?
-It's, uh...

23:37.834 --> 23:40.545
It's a tincture made
from the lobelia plant.

23:42.672 --> 23:45.216
An ancient remedy
for poisonous bites.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.427
-A cure?
-We hope.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.351
Do you really think
it will have some effect?

23:55.435 --> 23:58.271
It is our last resort, Sire.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.906
Perhaps you should
allow him to rest.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.283
| will not leave him.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.055
Please,
Merlin, you must beware.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.725
This is only the beginning.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.410
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

25:06.673 --> 25:07.757
Arthur.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.609
The Prince lives.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.964
(BIRD SQUAWKING)

25:49.799 --> 25:51.467
| thought we'd lost you.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.095
Don't worry, Father,
I'm not going to die.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.640
| think there's someone
watching over me,

25:57.724 --> 25:59.726
keeping me from harm.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.478
Maybe you're right.

26:02.562 --> 26:07.483
On your long journey to become
king, you'll need a guardian angel.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.946
| shall inform the court
that their Prince lives.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.917
| knew it.
| said you'd be all right.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.341
| can remember
you talking to me.

26:33.634 --> 26:36.095
-You can?
-You stroked my forehead.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.932
-I was tending to your fever.
-You never lost faith.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.978
-I was just talking.
-Tell me again what you said.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.482
-I don't remember.
-Yes, you do.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.026
-No, I don't.
-Come on.

26:50.151 --> 26:54.197
Something about
"the man I am inside."

26:57.033 --> 27:00.119
-No! I never said that.
-Guinevere!

27:01.454 --> 27:03.539
| have to get
these washed, Sire.

27:09.504 --> 27:11.130

28:07.436 --> 28:08.938
(BELL TOLLING)

28:29.542 --> 28:32.044
Gaius! I'm alive!

28:32.920 --> 28:35.548
-What is it? What's happened?
-Merlin, stay there.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.635
-What's wrong?
-No, don't.

28:43.264 --> 28:44.599
Mother?

28:47.768 --> 28:50.313
-Merlin.
-What's happened to her?

28:50.396 --> 28:51.981
GAIUS: She is gravely ill.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.233
-Do something!
-If I could.

28:54.317 --> 28:55.401
Please, Gaius!

28:55.484 --> 28:57.445
Merlin,
this is no ordinary iliness.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.908
This cannot happen!

29:01.991 --> 29:04.076
Who did you meet
at the Isle of Blessed?

29:04.160 --> 29:06.162
-Nimueh.
-Nimueh?

29:06.579 --> 29:08.748
It was as you said.
She demanded a price.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.000
But I bargained my life,
not my mother's.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.129
Merlin,
| wish there was something I could do.

29:18.507 --> 29:21.177
| will make you better,
| will.

29:28.309 --> 29:29.852
You knew this would happen!

29:30.686 --> 29:33.522
You had me trade
my mother's life for Arthur's!

29:33.648 --> 29:35.441
You said
you would do anything.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.777
Did you know my
mother would die?

29:37.860 --> 29:40.446
| knew the price
would be a heavy one.

29:40.529 --> 29:43.616
-But you sent me anyway.
-We need Arthur to live.

29:44.033 --> 29:47.078
-I'm not one of you.
-We are both creatures

29:47.203 --> 29:50.623
of the Old Religion.
It is the source of your power.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.626
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Your destiny

29:53.709 --> 29:57.713
is to protect the young
Pendragon until he claims his crown.

29:57.838 --> 30:02.093
And when he does,
magic can be returned to the realm.

30:02.218 --> 30:05.596
Only then will I be free.

30:07.181 --> 30:08.349
Oh.

30:10.893 --> 30:14.897
So that's all you've cared about?
| thought you were my friend.

30:15.022 --> 30:20.027
| am more than that, Merlin,
| am your Kin.,

30:20.736 --> 30:25.741
No, the only family I have is my
mother and you had me murder her.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.452
Her life has not
been taken in vain.

30:28.577 --> 30:32.331
We will achieve
great things together, you and I...

30:32.415 --> 30:34.375
You will never be released!

30:35.751 --> 30:40.297
For what you've done I will make sure
you never see the light.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.447
(GROWLS)

31:12.788 --> 31:13.956
Where is she?

31:16.417 --> 31:17.668
She's sleeping.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.777
| have to save her.

31:44.195 --> 31:45.613
You cannot.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.992
If the balance of the world needs a
life then Nimueh must take mine.

31:51.869 --> 31:53.329
No, Merlin.

31:54.455 --> 31:57.708
-Yes, I will return to the island.
-You are young.

31:58.501 --> 32:02.004
Your gifts, your destiny
are far too precious to sacrifice.

32:02.505 --> 32:05.007
My destiny? This is my mother.

32:06.634 --> 32:09.512
My powers mean nothing
if I cannot save her.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.143
You have taught me so much,

32:19.230 --> 32:21.023
taught me who I am,

32:22.525 --> 32:24.819
taught me
the purpose for my skills,

32:26.195 --> 32:29.990
taught me that magic should only
be used for great deeds,

32:32.993 --> 32:39.041
but most of all, you have
always taught me to do what is right.

32:43.546 --> 32:44.839
Merlin.

32:46.757 --> 32:47.883
(SNIFFLES)

32:53.055 --> 32:55.057
| need to say
goodbye to Arthur.

33:09.613 --> 33:10.781
Ah.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.117
-Merlin.
-How are you?

33:14.285 --> 33:15.411
Good.

33:16.704 --> 33:17.872
I'm pleased.

33:18.789 --> 33:22.751
Yes. I owe it all to Gaius.

33:28.132 --> 33:29.592
| need to talk to you.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.762
You still haven't got it yet,
have you?

33:34.763 --> 33:37.308
-I decide when we need to talk.
-Not today.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.812
| sometimes wonder
if you know who I am.

33:42.730 --> 33:45.441
-Oh, I know who you are.
-Good.

33:46.942 --> 33:50.279
You're a prat.
And a royal one.

33:52.781 --> 33:53.949
(LAUGHS)

33:56.243 --> 33:58.787
Are you ever going
to change, Merlin?

33:58.913 --> 34:00.289
No. You'd get bored.

34:02.499 --> 34:06.670
Promise me this, if you get another
servant, don't get a bootlicker.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.797
Is this is you trying
to leave your job?

34:08.880 --> 34:09.965
No.

34:11.342 --> 34:14.303
I'm happy to be your servant
till the day I die.

34:22.478 --> 34:26.774
Sometimes I think
| know you, Merlin. Other times...

34:26.857 --> 34:32.487
Well, I know you,
and you're a great warrior.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.659
One day you will
be a great king.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.828
That's very kind of you.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.748
But you must learn to listen
as well as you fight.

34:43.666 --> 34:46.502
-Any other pointers?
-No.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.422
That's it.

34:53.342 --> 34:57.554
Just don't be a prat.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.200
GWEN: Gaius had to go
and get some supplies.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.744
He asked me to
keep an eye on her until you got back...

35:21.245 --> 35:22.538
Thank you.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.797
-I'm sorry.
-No, she'll get better.

35:33.716 --> 35:36.719
I've tried to make her
a little comfortable.

35:38.887 --> 35:42.266
You have such a good heart, Gwen.
Don't ever lose that.

35:58.157 --> 36:02.411
I'm going to make you well again.
| promise. You'll see.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.959
You're such a good son.

36:15.424 --> 36:18.093
But I don't want you
to worry about me.

36:19.303 --> 36:22.890
| know that the Gods
will look after me and that one day

36:23.599 --> 36:25.267
| will see you again.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.521
| will miss you.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.110
| will miss you, too.

37:01.678 --> 37:02.888
Gaius?

37:20.322 --> 37:24.827
GAIUS: Dear Merlin,
my life is already near to its end.

37:26.703 --> 37:30.416
There has, for the most part,
been very little purpose to it

37:32.000 --> 37:34.211
very little that
will be remembered.

37:36.338 --> 37:41.510
In contrast, Merlin,
your life is destined for greatness.

37:44.054 --> 37:47.057
Live by the tenets
| have taught you

37:47.182 --> 37:52.688
and I believe you will, in time,
become the greatest warlock ever.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.526
To have known you
has been my greatest pleasure

37:57.609 --> 38:02.030
and to sacrifice myself for you
is but an honor.

38:03.574 --> 38:09.079
You are and always will be
the son I never had.

38:12.583 --> 38:13.709
No!

38:46.408 --> 38:48.785
NIMUEH: I never thought
I'd see you here again.

38:51.914 --> 38:53.957
-My lady.
-It's a long time

38:54.082 --> 38:57.544
-since you called me that.
-I've come to ask for your help.

38:57.628 --> 39:02.508
As you once did before for Uther.
You did not like the outcome.

39:02.591 --> 39:05.594
| offer a chance for you to atone
for the death of his wife.

39:06.094 --> 39:09.515
| have saved the life of her son.
What more do you ask for?

39:09.598 --> 39:12.017
That this time you
take a just price.

39:12.100 --> 39:15.896
Merlin intends
to offer his life for his mother's.

39:15.979 --> 39:18.190
| want you to take
mine in his place.

39:18.774 --> 39:19.942
(LAUGHS)

39:21.193 --> 39:25.322
With all my powers of prediction,
| could never have foretold this.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.784
Gaius the hero.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.502
Why should I grant your wish?

39:39.336 --> 39:42.965
You stood and watched as our
friends burned in the Great Purge.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.800
You are nothing but a traitor.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.720
Merlin is the one man
who can bring magic back to this land.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.683
At Arthur's side
he can help forge a new Kingdom.

39:53.684 --> 39:57.312
A world of peace and beauty
that we can only dream of.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.649
And you're willing
to give your life, Gaius,

40:00.732 --> 40:02.818
for the future
they will bring?

40:04.444 --> 40:05.612
I'm waiting.

40:08.657 --> 40:10.909
Are you ready to die, Gaius?

40:16.290 --> 40:17.583
Gaius?

40:19.751 --> 40:23.130
For Merlin,
| will give my life.

40:31.305 --> 40:33.181
(NIMUEH CHANTING)

40:37.352 --> 40:38.437
Stop!

40:40.939 --> 40:42.649
Back again so soon, warlock?

40:44.526 --> 40:47.696
-What've you done?
-Your mother is safe.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.115
Isn't that what you wanted?

40:51.199 --> 40:53.910
-Have you killed him?
-It was his wish.

40:56.330 --> 40:59.583
| bid my life for Arthur's,
not my mother's, not Gaius'.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.669
The Old Religion does not care
who lives and who dies.

41:02.753 --> 41:05.380
Only that
the balance of the world is restored.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.676
To save a life, a life must be taken.
Gaius knew this.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.888
It is not the Old Religion
that has done this. It is you.

41:13.805 --> 41:17.976
Come now. We are too valuable
to each other to be enemies.

41:18.060 --> 41:19.936
No, I share nothing with you.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.980
With my help
Arthur will become king.

41:22.064 --> 41:25.317
| will make Arthur king.
But you will never see that day.

You think I would join forces
with such a selfish and cruel magic?

-Never.
-So be it.
