10:35.676 --> 10:37.219
I am lucky.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.930
I have a husband
and three wonderful children.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.557
Thank you very much.

10:41.641 --> 10:45.269
Listen, baby.
I always get what I want.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.313
-I said no.
-Oh, did ya?

10:47.396 --> 10:50.399
Oh, I completely misunderstood.
Please accept our apologies.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.236
Sometimes you gotta go
where everybody knows your name.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.738
Hey, guys!

10:55.821 --> 10:58.282
(fan squeaking)

11:00.493 --> 11:02.036
Moe, get the darts.
I wanna play.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.246
No. We're phasing out
the games.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.040
People drink less when
they're having fun.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.041
Oh.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.421
Oh, sure. Like lawyers work
in big skyscrapers

11:12.505 --> 11:13.631
and have secretaries.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.883
Look at him.
He's wearing a belt.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.635
That's Hollywood for you.

11:17.718 --> 11:21.681
MARGE: Ooh, I've never been
to an underground club.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.769
Don't you think
your hair is a bit much?

11:26.852 --> 11:28.396
Hey, Mrs. Simpson,

11:28.479 --> 11:32.608
you should try one of these
smart drinks. (laughs)

11:32.692 --> 11:36.028
Oh, wow.
I've wasted my life.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.822
Would you, uh,
care to dance?

11:37.905 --> 11:40.199
Mayor Quimby!
What are you doing here?

11:40.282 --> 11:41.659
I'm here with my nephews.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.911
Oh, that's nice.

11:48.165 --> 11:52.461
Ooh, jet. Whoo-hoo!
It's Garrett Morris's birthday.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.587
Hmph.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.881
This is not
a library.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.134
This is not a Kwik-E-Mart.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.721
What was it
you wanted to show me?

12:01.804 --> 12:03.180
-This.
-(gasps)

12:03.264 --> 12:05.474
You're not gonna hunt me
for sport, are you?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.143
(chuckles)
Relax, Marge.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.146
I'd never turn
a gun on a human being.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.564
My husband,
on the other hand.

12:11.647 --> 12:14.066
(gunshots)

12:14.150 --> 12:16.610
-Come on. You try it.
-No. I couldn't.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.321
Yeah. Just breathe slowly
and squeeze the--

12:19.405 --> 12:21.699
(gunshots)

12:21.782 --> 12:23.617
I hit it! I hit it!

12:23.701 --> 12:26.579
My cans.
My precious antique cans.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.914
Aw, look what
you done to 'em.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.291
Well, it's getting late.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.293
Maybe we should call it
a night.

12:32.376 --> 12:35.463
It's only midnight.
Come on. I know a place.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.631
Whoa.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.092
Beautiful, huh?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.052
Homer and I used to
come up here on dates.

12:45.389 --> 12:48.601
Homer, stop that.
It's just a weather station.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.813
(grunts) Come on, Marge.
It's fun to smash things.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.275
(laughs)
I smashed it good.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.527
You got real "purdy" hair.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.987
You know, Marge,

13:00.070 --> 13:01.489
of all the places
we've been tonight,

13:01.572 --> 13:03.741
I think I like
this one the best.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.950
Mmm. Me too.

13:05.034 --> 13:08.746
Look, you can see
our houses.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.247
MARGE: There's an awful lot
of black smoke

13:10.331 --> 13:11.999
coming from my chimney.

13:12.082 --> 13:15.878
Mr. Hutz, why are you burning
all your personal papers?

13:15.961 --> 13:18.881
As of this moment,
Lionel Hutz no longer exists.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.467
Say hello to Miguel Sanchez.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.636
Mmm, maybe we should
call it a night.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.347
Okay. I should get home
to my daughter

13:26.430 --> 13:28.641
before that naked talk show
comes on.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.643
(starts engine)

13:30.726 --> 13:32.603
Ah, young love.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.191
The old make-out place.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.195
Hey, a new weather station!

13:41.278 --> 13:45.241
I'll bash it good.
Oh...

13:45.324 --> 13:47.660
It's just no fun
without Marge.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.874
Ah, there's nothing like
moonshine from your own still.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.210
Oh, Simpson.

13:56.293 --> 13:57.878
What are you doing here?

13:57.962 --> 14:00.506
My wife's having
a girls' night out.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.299
Ah, just get one of those
inflatable women.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.467
But make sure it's
a woman though.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.053
'Cause one time I--
(stammering)

14:07.721 --> 14:10.182
Come on. I'll, uh--
I'll give you a ride home.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.647
(groans)
I miss you, Marge.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.107
Huh.
Their left taillight's

14:18.190 --> 14:19.817
a little smaller than
their right one.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.820
-I better pull 'em over.
-(siren wails)

14:22.903 --> 14:26.156
-I think they want us to stop.
-Fat chance.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.576
-This car's stolen.
-Stolen?

14:28.659 --> 14:30.870
-(revs engine)
-(Marge screams)

Ruth, is there something
you wanna tell me?

15:00.649 --> 15:01.942
Remember when I said

15:02.026 --> 15:04.028
my ex-husband was behind
on his child support?

15:04.111 --> 15:05.446
Mm-hmm.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.740
Well, to even things up,
I kind of stole his car.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.408
Didn't you realize
all you had to do was

15:09.491 --> 15:11.118
report him to the police?

15:11.201 --> 15:14.246
Marge, you're the levelheaded
friend I never had.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.247
(groans)

15:16.957 --> 15:20.002
We're in pursuit
of two female suspects.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.379
One is wearing
a green dress, pearls,

15:22.463 --> 15:24.131
and has a lot of blue hair.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.842
A lot of blue hair?
(giggles) What a freak.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.429
-(car hits bump)
-Ooh!

15:30.512 --> 15:32.306
(screams)
It's Marge!

15:32.389 --> 15:34.016
She's become a crazed criminal

15:34.099 --> 15:35.976
just because I didn't
take her to the ballet.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.562
That's exactly
how Dillinger got started.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.688
Really?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.066
I don't wanna be
a wet blanket,

15:42.149 --> 15:43.359
but maybe you should
give yourself up.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.194
Marge, it's a matter
of principle.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.696
I just can't let
that deadbeat win again.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.865
You're with me, aren't ya?

15:53.994 --> 15:55.579
Look, Marge,
there's no reason

15:55.663 --> 15:57.748
for you to get
dragged into this.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.333
Once we lose the cops,
I'll let you out.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.376
Well, I don't think
they're gonna be

16:00.459 --> 16:01.585
that easy to lose.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.629
These are professional
lawmen and--

these highways, you know.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.943
You can call
a cab in there.

16:26.026 --> 16:29.655
Well... bye.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.616
I'm sorry about all this.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.952
But you gotta admit,
we did have some fun.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.954
Yeah. Everything before
the high-speed chase

16:37.037 --> 16:39.039
was just lovely.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.167
Hey. You're
a good friend, Marge.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.711
Mmm.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.511
(coin clatters)

16:52.594 --> 16:55.097
This cross-country flight
from the law would be hell

16:55.180 --> 16:56.140
if we didn't stick together.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.642
Hey. Friends stick together.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.020
It's amazing how through
all this adversity,

17:01.103 --> 17:02.563
we managed
to stick together.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.898
If there's one thing
decent folk do,

17:04.982 --> 17:06.608
it's stick together.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.777
I hate it when
the waffles stick together.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.071
Sticking together
is what good waffles do.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.335
Marge, what are you doing?

17:25.419 --> 17:27.713
Ruth, I've done a lot
of thinking,

17:27.796 --> 17:29.923
and I really
consider you a friend.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.759
And an important part
of friendship is--

17:33.969 --> 17:35.971

17:36.055 --> 17:37.973
You know that drives away
all my business.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.184
See you tomorrow, loser.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.354

17:44.438 --> 17:46.815
Mmm, engine-block eggs.

17:46.899 --> 17:50.069
If we can keep these down,
we'll be sitting pretty.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.030
-That's them!
-Quiet. I can't hear the eggs.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.823

17:59.745 --> 18:00.913
Don't worry.
Mr. Hutz is still here

18:00.996 --> 18:01.914
to take care of us.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.583

Mom would violently rise up

until it's over.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.006

I should've asked first.

19:34.089 --> 19:38.135
No, Marge. You did it.
We really are gonna make it now.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.973
Oh, no!

drive right into it

19:46.894 --> 19:49.104

your wedding dress

20:04.453 --> 20:06.246
And I'm sorry--
Oh, well, let's just say

20:06.330 --> 20:08.123
I'm sorry for the whole
marriage up to this point.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.876
You're right.
I am lucky to have him.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.755

don't drive into that chasm!
