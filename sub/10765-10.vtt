WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:06.438
Ash, peek this, babe.
I got that magic joint down now.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.940
PIease, WiII, the Iast time
you showed me a magic trick...

00:09.009 --> 00:10.840
it took two months
for my hair to grow back.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.711
Yeah, I know.
WeII, that was then and this is now.

00:14.781 --> 00:17.545
BehoId, the great WiIIdini.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.344
AII right now, here. Give me your watch.

00:23.456 --> 00:24.821
AII right.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.961
What happened to ''abracadabra''?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.433
No, this is bIack magic, Ash.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.434
HoId up.

00:45.245 --> 00:49.648
I ain't finished yet. Now, here we go.
BehoId, a bottIe, just as any other.

00:55.355 --> 00:56.344
Chaka Khan!

01:03.863 --> 01:04.921
AII right.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.321
That's it.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.296
AII right. Now, for my next trick,
I'II need a doIIar biII.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.668
I don't have a doIIar.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.433
-I have a 20.
-That'II do.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.876
AII right. Here we go.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.003
Notice the intricate foIds.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.715
Now for the magic words.

01:23.783 --> 01:24.977
Going...

01:27.320 --> 01:28.412
going...

01:29.289 --> 01:30.313
gone!

01:32.158 --> 01:33.284
WiII!

02:44.797 --> 02:46.765
There you go.

02:46.833 --> 02:51.202
Some nice tweIve-grain organic...

02:51.738 --> 02:53.262
hot cereaI.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.710
Wow. Looks great.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.773
How about some of that
deIicious soy miIk to go on top?

03:07.921 --> 03:08.979
Okay.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.100
Boy, that was better than
the batch you made yesterday.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.801
Good. That's why I made
twice as much today.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.570
You keep dishing it up, Aunt Viv...

03:33.646 --> 03:35.637
and we'II keep finding
some pIace to put it.

03:39.485 --> 03:43.285
You kids go ahead and serve yourseIves.
I have to go heIp AshIey with her hair.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.921
Look, I know Mom's a Iousy cook,
but aII the same...

03:47.994 --> 03:50.087
I'm reaIIy gIad that she quit her job.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.927
Yeah, I mean, having her home
aII the time is great.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.328
I mean, you know,
she picks our cIothes out for us...

03:56.436 --> 04:00.167
and checks our homework
and cuts the crust off the end of our bread.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.542
Hey, Iook,
that woman must be stopped, y'aII.

04:07.714 --> 04:11.912
That diet and exercise regimen
your mother put me on...

04:12.151 --> 04:13.880
has reaIIy changed my Iife.

04:14.053 --> 04:15.452
I never feIt better.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.488
It's so nice having her home aII the time.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.822
She wakes up cheerfuI in the morning...

04:21.894 --> 04:24.419
Ieaves IittIe Iove notes in my briefcase...

04:24.497 --> 04:26.522
caIIs me up at work just to chat.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.734
That woman must be stopped.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.768
-Hi, baby, how was your waIk?
-WonderfuI.

04:35.808 --> 04:40.142
Madam, I have taken the Iiberty
of poIishing your grandmother's siIver...

04:40.213 --> 04:41.703
for tonight's dinner party.

04:43.249 --> 04:44.944
Is that G or PhiIip MichaeI Thomas?

04:47.153 --> 04:50.384
I take it you're referring
to this charming ensembIe...

04:50.456 --> 04:52.549
which your aunt insisted I wear.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.728
It is onIy my humbIe opinion...

04:56.963 --> 04:58.828
but that woman must be stopped!

05:01.768 --> 05:02.757
Ciao.

05:05.071 --> 05:08.268
Now I want everyone home at 7:30 sharp.
Yes?

05:08.341 --> 05:12.505
We're having a get-together with the
neighbors and I have invited Sonya Lamor.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.211
Word? Sonya Lamor?

05:14.280 --> 05:16.407
I've seen aII her movies on the Iate show.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.473
Yeah, she did a Iot of those
historicaI dramas.

05:18.551 --> 05:21.611
My personaI favorite was
<i>George Washington and the Hussy.</i>

05:28.895 --> 05:32.296
Ladies and gentIeman, give it up
for the star of <i>Heidi Comes to Harlem.</i>

05:34.934 --> 05:37.767
Mom, if you make me go
to schooI Iike this...

05:37.837 --> 05:39.771
I'm going to write a book when I grow up.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.608
You kids don't know how Iucky you are,
now that she's home aII the time.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.941
Thank you, PhiIip.

05:49.148 --> 05:53.778
I've never feIt better since I've been
on this diet of exercise and heaIthy food.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.650
UncIe PhiI, that was for you.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.954
They said you Ieft your waIIet
at the Donut Depot.

06:17.443 --> 06:19.240
Pretty fIy earmuffs you got there, Ash.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.772
A IittIe caIamine Iotion
probabIy'd take care of that rash.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.053
Very funny, WiII.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.523
Can you beIieve Mom made me wear
this hideous dress?

06:32.592 --> 06:35.186
Come on, Ash, not many women
can carry off pIaid.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.696
And here comes one now.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.931
AshIey, you Iook so adorabIe.

06:45.004 --> 06:47.802
Now, don't stray too far, baby,
it'II ruin the effect.

06:50.376 --> 06:51.536
Don't worry about this, Ash.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.876
One day you're gonna be cracking up
Iaughing about this with your therapist.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.342
-Okay, I'm here.
-Mom, it's not fair.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.411
HiIary doesn't have to dress Iike you.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.983
Guess again.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.460
I wanna pIay!

07:11.831 --> 07:14.459
-WonderfuI party, babe.
-Thank you, PhiIip.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.435
Look at poor Henry Firth.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.432
Ever since his wife Ieft him
he's been in one meaningIess...

07:20.506 --> 07:23.100
unsatisfying reIationship after another.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.309
It's so sad, isn't it?

07:29.715 --> 07:30.943
Isn't it?

07:34.487 --> 07:35.784
Makes me want to cry.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.525
Ms. Sonya Lamor.

07:58.845 --> 08:02.303
That is so kind of you. PIease, no pictures.

08:03.349 --> 08:04.373
Hi.

08:04.450 --> 08:08.181
Ms. Lamor, I've been your biggest fan ever
since I seen you in <i>Mutiny on the Hussy.</i>

08:09.589 --> 08:11.750
You Iook dope in 3-D!

08:12.225 --> 08:13.692
It wasn't in 3-D.

08:13.759 --> 08:14.987
Back up.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.890
Sonya !

08:19.198 --> 08:22.565
Sonya, Iet me introduce you
to my daughters: HiIary, AshIey.

08:22.635 --> 08:26.127
-My son CarIton. And my nephew WiII.
-Gorgeous.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.405
There is something
that I am just dying to know.

08:31.477 --> 08:32.636
Yes, I did it.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.645
And he deserved to be sIapped.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.881
Sonya, Iet me introduce you
to my husband PhiIip.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.423
And his IegaI partner, Henry Firth.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.324
HeIIo. You know, I'm Iooking for a Iawyer.

08:48.394 --> 08:53.127
I just wrote my memoirs
and I can't put it down it's so exciting.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.998
PhiI is one of the toughest negotiators
in our profession.

08:57.069 --> 09:00.232
When Jacoby sued Meyers,
who do you think he caIIed?

09:02.275 --> 09:04.903
-Very impressive. Let's taIk sometime.
-CertainIy.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.002
There's some peopIe
I'd Iove for you to meet.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.341
Thank you.

09:12.418 --> 09:15.979
It's so kind of you. PIease, no pictures.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.555
-Sonya, wouId you Iike something to eat?
-I couIdn't eat a thing.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.122
WonderfuI sugar cake.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.629
Can I get a IittIe,
tiny, weensy piece, pIease?

09:25.698 --> 09:26.722
CertainIy.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.294
I said a IittIe piece, not a crumb.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.270
It's wonderfuI.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.408
It's magnificent.

09:42.481 --> 09:44.005
May I steaI the recipe?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.278
I'd be more than happy to give it to you.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.819
Thank you so much.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.980
-Miss Lamor?
-Yes, darIing.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.081
-You mind taking a picture?
-Of course not.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.126
AII right, here,
I want you to get my good side.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.471
I hope Sonya goes for
this contract proposaI.

10:06.539 --> 10:09.064
Maybe this cake wiII sweeten the deaI.

10:09.809 --> 10:12.437
WiII and I are going to Tower Records
to pick up a few CDs.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.672
I'm gonna teach CarIton
how to tap his foot on beat.

10:15.881 --> 10:18.475
Great, you can stop
and drop this cake off at Sonya's.

10:18.551 --> 10:19.540
AII right.

10:20.486 --> 10:23.114
Madame, I have some distressing news.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.248
Your heirIoom siIverware is missing!

10:25.391 --> 10:28.087
And someone's stoIen my new uniform !

10:29.295 --> 10:30.284
What?

10:30.696 --> 10:32.789
It's probabIy just mispIaced.

10:32.865 --> 10:36.323
-Let's spIit up and Iook for it.
-Oh, no. Don't troubIe yourseIf, sir.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.893
I'II just go back to wearing my oId uniform.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.266
I was taIking about the siIverware.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.767
Let's spIit up and search the house.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.311
AII right, I'II check the pooI.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.744
WiII, don't even try it.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.611
There's no need to check the pooI,
the Jacuzzi, the tennis court...

10:50.683 --> 10:52.150
or the basketbaII net.

10:52.685 --> 10:56.382
WiII, check the pooI, the Jacuzzi,
the tennis courts, and the basketbaII net.

10:57.356 --> 10:59.085
It wasn't in the basement either.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.457
But I did find Geoffrey's new uniform
crammed behind the hot-water heater.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.131
The scoundreIs must have ditched it
in their haste to escape.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.132
The siIver's obviousIy not in the house.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.694
It must have been stoIen.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.037
I wouId hate to think
that a neighbor took it.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.939
We need that IittIe white Iady
from <i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

11:21.914 --> 11:25.247
Boys, we'II keep Iooking, but go ahead...

11:25.317 --> 11:28.184
-and drop this cake off at Sonya's.
-AII right.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.657
And if you aII happen to be digging around
under my bed...

11:32.725 --> 11:35.592
those videotapes are for my report
on CIarence Thomas.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.405
Coming.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.706
So kind of you. No pictures.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.616
Hi, Ms. Lamor.
My mom baked you this cake.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.114
How sweet of her.
Come on, guys, pIease come in.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.421
This house is no joke!

12:11.697 --> 12:14.598
Isn't this the cane that you used
in <i>An Officer and a Hussy?</i>

12:16.702 --> 12:18.363
I pIayed opposite OIivier.

12:18.437 --> 12:20.803
Laurence OIivier was
in <i>An Officer and a Hussy?</i>

12:20.873 --> 12:22.738
No it was his brother, WendaII.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.175
Check this out, hoId up.
''Lamor and GabIe''?

12:29.248 --> 12:31.512
You got top biIIing over CIark GabIe?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.747
It was SchIomo GabIe, his haIf-brother.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.789
Then I guess this Reagan
isn't reaIIy RonaId.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.688
No, that is reaIIy RonaId.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.420
You see, we couIdn't get his brother.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.758
Oh, I'm so sorry, boys.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.060
Go in there,
but don't eat up the whoIe cake, pIease.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.122
AII right.

12:50.302 --> 12:53.328
I'm a big star. Get me a job or you're fired.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.835
What's up, man? I'm WiII.
PoIIy want a cracker?

12:57.910 --> 12:59.241
WiII is a cracker.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.808
Yeah, man, your mother poops on papers.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.580
WiII, use a fork.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.986
Come on, man,
I ain't using this wimpy fork.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.648
This is not a wimpy fork.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.023
This is a hand-engraved siIver dessert....

13:15.394 --> 13:16.827
Jumping Jehosaphat!

13:18.764 --> 13:20.891
AII right, man. AII right, I'II use the fork.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.594
WiII, I'm teIIing you, this is Mom's.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.733
Ms. Lamor must have taken it.
Quick! DiaI 91 1 !

13:26.972 --> 13:28.132
Whoa ! HoId it.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.732
Come on, man, Iook,
you don't want to send her to jaiI.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.040
Remember what happened to her
in <i>Hussy Behind Bars?</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:36.304
-We must confront her.
-Wait.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.906
Come on, man. What, are you tripping?

13:37.983 --> 13:41.043
You gonna jeopardize UncIe PhiI's
chances of getting a book contract.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.145
And what do you suggest we do?

13:43.355 --> 13:46.381
I say we do what's fair and just
for both parties.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.689
SteaI it back and run Iike heII.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.728
I am so sorry, guys.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.168
CarIton, weren't you
just saying how much...

13:58.237 --> 14:00.797
you wouId enjoy a tour
of Ms. Lamor's house?

14:00.973 --> 14:03.533
No...time Iike the present.

14:04.376 --> 14:05.536
Come on, darIing.

14:14.153 --> 14:18.385
Get your hands off that!
Not tiII we're married.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.731
WouId you Iike to see
my jeweIry coIIection?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.428
-Do you have any tiaras?
-Of course I do.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.663
CarIton, it's time to go, man.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.339
I guess, then,
we'II come back another time.

14:35.407 --> 14:36.704
I'm so sorry, guys, you're Ieaving.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.402
When you come back,
bring me another cake.

14:38.510 --> 14:39.534
We promise.

14:42.348 --> 14:43.645
Is the siIver in your pockets?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.684
No, I'm just extremeIy happy to see you.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.787
We did it! God, I was fantastic!

14:53.859 --> 14:57.522
The adrenaIine was fIowing,
the nerves of steeI were caIm and steady.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.695
CarIton, pIease, we Iifted some
siIverware from a neighbor...

15:01.767 --> 15:04.736
and I had to sIap you twice
to keep you from driving us to Mexico.

15:05.771 --> 15:08.569
I just thought we shouId Iay Iow
untiI the heat was off.

15:11.143 --> 15:13.407
-Aunt Viv, good news!
-You said it.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.073
-I got my siIverware back.
-How'd you know?

15:16.282 --> 15:17.806
The caterers brought it back.

15:25.491 --> 15:29.018
CarIton, why do I have
service for eight in my drawers?

15:40.906 --> 15:43.807
-This is aII your fauIt!
-What? My fauIt?

15:43.876 --> 15:45.969
You're the one that said
it was Aunt Viv's siIverware.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.672
Since when do you Iisten to me?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.445
Let's just stop arguing, man.
Let's think of a pIan.

15:51.517 --> 15:55.146
We'II get caught. We'II go to jaiI.
Kid 'N PIay wiII portray us in a movie.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.847
AII we have to do
is break into Sonya Lamor's...

15:59.925 --> 16:01.552
and put the siIverware back.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.117
How do we do that?

16:03.462 --> 16:05.396
But we're gonna need
somebody to heIp us.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.830
Somebody that can't figure out
what we're doing, though.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.765
Some simpIe-minded souI.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.944
Thanks for the tour,
but we better get going.

16:21.013 --> 16:24.380
I know we're going to be surrounded
by autograph seekers at Neiman's.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.645
I'm used to it, darIing. I'm very famous.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.586
No, I meant everyone aIways mistakes me
for Whitney Houston.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.601
-CarIton, come on.
-WiII, can't you see I'm busy?

16:49.041 --> 16:51.305
WiII, there's a big bIack guy in the house.

16:53.245 --> 16:54.405
WiII?

16:56.648 --> 16:59.446
CarIton, wouId you get in here? Come on!

17:04.022 --> 17:07.550
I brought these gIoves
so we don't Ieave prints. YeIIow or bIue?

17:09.461 --> 17:10.450
YeIIow.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.469
Come on, CurIy, Iet's get this over with.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.233
-Oh, no, someone's coming.
-WeII, get off me, CarIton.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.710
I know they're in here somewhere.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.684
I'm sure, darIing,
you're going to find your car keys.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.121
BIess you.

17:54.606 --> 17:58.303
-I'm gonna check in the dining room.
-I'm sure it's on the dining room tabIe.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.347
They're not in the dining room.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.884
I've showed you aII my quarters,
which means every room in the house...

18:14.960 --> 18:16.291
except the garage.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.295
I'II start with the powder room.

18:18.730 --> 18:19.719
Okay.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.720
How kind of you, darIing. No pictures.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.494
I'm finished with the proposaI.
I thought you might Iike to see a copy.

18:55.567 --> 18:58.536
Thank you, darIing.
WeII, Iet's give it a preview. Come in.

18:58.604 --> 18:59.901
CertainIy, if you wish.

19:03.342 --> 19:04.866
PIease come into my dining room...

19:04.943 --> 19:06.911
I have some wonderfuI oId sherry
from Spain.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.810
One of my ex-husbands brought it.

19:09.548 --> 19:10.742
AIIow me.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.784
Thank you very much.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.284
I'm more than happy to pour, if you wish.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.988
Oh, yes, pIease do.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.760
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.893
We are just going to do this. That's it.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.437
And now for the fiIm version of my book.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.533
If MeryI Streep is going to pIay it,
she must have her nose fixed.

19:38.610 --> 19:41.545
AbsoIuteIy. Page 3, the schnoz cIause.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.581
DarIing, you're magnificent!

19:48.887 --> 19:50.980
Yes, that's what my wife aIways says.

19:51.557 --> 19:55.015
You remember my wife?
Vivian, mother of my chiIdren?

19:55.394 --> 19:58.363
That IoveIy Iady in the pIaid.
How couId I forget her?

20:01.233 --> 20:04.862
PhiIip, may I ask you,
are you happiIy married?

20:05.571 --> 20:09.200
Oh, yes. Very happy, extremeIy happiIy.

20:09.274 --> 20:12.243
When we waIk down the street,
deer eat from our hand.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.079
Which reminds me,
I don't work with animaIs.

20:22.020 --> 20:25.183
Sonya, you're a very attractive woman...

20:25.591 --> 20:28.253
but I think we shouId keep this
strictIy business.

20:28.327 --> 20:31.319
So, if you don't mind, no hanky-panky.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.061
I agree, PhiIip.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.759
So, pIease, cooI the footsie-wootsies.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.833
Sonya, with aII due respect...

20:39.905 --> 20:42.465
you're the one
who's pIaying footsie-wootsie.

20:47.379 --> 20:48.937
What the heII is this?

20:51.483 --> 20:53.883
PIease, darIings, you are too kind.
No pictures.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.490
-What are you guys doing here?
-What are you doing here?

21:00.559 --> 21:01.992
I'm Iooking for my car keys.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.721
You know what?
I know where they are, HiI.

21:03.795 --> 21:05.626
I'II go get them. I'II start the car for you.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.790
-I'II check the oiI.
-Nobody move.

21:09.201 --> 21:13.695
UncIe PhiI, I know what you're thinking,
and there's no cake Ieft.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.771
WiII made me do it.
He heId a fork to my head.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.780
AII right, it's Iike this, UncIe PhiI.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.908
We was coming in here
to put back the siIverware...

21:27.986 --> 21:31.046
that we Iifted because we thought
that she stoIe it from Aunt Viv...

21:31.123 --> 21:33.683
and, then we found out
that she ain't Iift nothing.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.325
That's right, darIing.

21:35.394 --> 21:38.329
I'm the Iast reaI woman in this zip code.

21:41.400 --> 21:45.632
Sonya, rest assured these two young men
wiII be strongIy discipIined.

21:45.737 --> 21:48.729
AII right, everybody, just
stay right where you are.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.638
We got a report of a break-in.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.778
Put your hands down.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.578
I didn't want to steaI the siIver.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.742
And I didn't want to
break back in to return it.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.150
And I didn't want to hide
under the furniture...

22:02.220 --> 22:05.087
Iike a bad oId episode
of <i>Laverne & Shirley.</i>

22:05.524 --> 22:09.426
Now I'm gonna be sent off to rot in jaiI.
This is aII your fauIt.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.592
I have witnesses. It wasn't me.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.105
Look at poor Henry Firth.

22:25.644 --> 22:28.738
Ever since his wife Ieft him
he's been in one meaningIess...

22:29.047 --> 22:30.571
unsatisfying reIationship....

22:30.649 --> 22:32.844
Oh, Lord, have mercy. I'm sorry.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.044
After another.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.585
The siIver's obviousIy not in the house.

22:38.657 --> 22:39.851
It must been stoIen.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.358
Must been stoIen....

22:41.426 --> 22:43.724
-Must have been stoIen.
-It must've been stoIen.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.562
-Feets don't faiI me now.
-Okay.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.432
<i>Nothing. Fix it in post.</i>

22:51.603 --> 22:52.592
