01:21.165 --> 01:23.834
Well, do you think
I'm gonna open it?

01:36.597 --> 01:37.597
Idiot.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.571
Step aside, oaf.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.117
You, do what Mama says
and you won't get hurt.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.494
Please, ma'am. I'm only the butler.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.497
Well, then, you would know
where the safe is, wouldn't you?

02:03.624 --> 02:04.624
Wouldn't you?

02:07.920 --> 02:10.047
Do they really pay you enough for this?

02:10.756 --> 02:12.049
Uh-uh-uh.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.469
This way.

02:15.553 --> 02:16.887
Please.

02:26.272 --> 02:29.317
Electrostatic tumblers.
Intermittent timer. Hmm.

02:30.443 --> 02:32.361
I think a magno-bomb should do the job.

02:32.445 --> 02:33.696
A magno-bomb?

02:33.779 --> 02:35.781
What are you trying to do,
blow up the whole house?

02:35.865 --> 02:37.742
Again with the criticism?

02:37.825 --> 02:40.578
Look, it's not like this is
the first time I've blown up a safe.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.372
No, but it would be the first time
you've done it right.

02:43.456 --> 02:46.018
You know, other mothers might show
a little confidence in their children.

02:46.042 --> 02:47.126
And other mothers might...

02:47.668 --> 02:48.878
Just do it!

02:51.297 --> 02:52.297
Goggles.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.029
Oh!

03:15.112 --> 03:17.448
You don't know how long
I've waited for this.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.368
What else they got?

03:22.078 --> 03:24.205
I have what I came for.

03:25.456 --> 03:27.625
But, Ma, they got all this other stuff.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.252
Are you arguing with your mother?

03:30.336 --> 03:32.296
- Well, no, but...
- But?

03:34.757 --> 03:37.176
- Nothing.
- Good. Now, come on.

03:41.931 --> 03:44.225
Hello, police?
I want to report a robbery.

03:44.892 --> 03:45.976
A ruby ring.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.356
And 20,000 credits.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.067
Ma Mayhem?

03:53.150 --> 03:57.071
<i>A tabloid gave her that name.
It was the golden age of alliteration.</i>

03:57.154 --> 03:59.591
So what do you want me to do?
Wait till she tries to fence the ruby?

03:59.615 --> 04:01.826
I have a feeling
she'll be holding onto it.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.661
There was another robbery a week ago.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.413
- <i>More rubies?</i>
- Exactly.

04:05.496 --> 04:06.816
<i>What's she gonna do
with them all?</i>

04:06.956 --> 04:10.668
Don't know, but I have a feeling
she's not making slippers.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.547
- <i>Slippers? From rubies?</i>
- Mmm. Before your time.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.590
<i>What I need from</i> you <i>is...</i>

04:16.674 --> 04:18.777
It'II have to wait till tonight.
I got to get to class.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.928
<i>It's family studies,
and I'm failing.</i>

04:21.720 --> 04:24.598
How does someone fail family studies?

04:35.401 --> 04:36.986
Today's question is,

04:37.069 --> 04:38.988
how many of you expect
to be parents someday?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.163
Excellent.

04:47.246 --> 04:50.833
This week's project will help show you
what parenthood is all about.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.794
And for those of you who are failing,

04:53.878 --> 04:56.672
it will be one last chance to catch up

04:56.755 --> 05:00.342
because this assignment will count
for a full half of your final grade.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.599
Aww!

05:07.057 --> 05:08.434
Yes, they do look cute,

05:08.517 --> 05:11.479
until you have the responsibility
of caring for them.

05:11.562 --> 05:14.106
And that's exactly
what you'll be doing this week.

05:14.190 --> 05:18.360
That means feeding it, bathing it
rocking it, whatever it takes.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.279
I've divided you into random couples.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.490
Nelson, you'll be paired with Maxine.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.076
John Kay and Rachel Ing.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.496
Frankie Lewis and Matilda Ides.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.372
Howard Groote and Dana Tan.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.291
Hi, honey.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.127
Terry McGinnis and Blade Sommer.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.923
Steven Tetsuo and Jackie Wallis.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.842
Hey, looks a little like you, McGinnis.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.137
Careful, Dana.

05:45.221 --> 05:47.139
You've got make sure
to support his head.

05:47.223 --> 05:49.683
Howard, that's all it is, is a head.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.728
- So, you want to hold it?
- Huh? Oh, sure.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.481
Corey Cavalieri and Ruth Wade.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.776
Each of your eggbabies
has a built-in computer

05:58.859 --> 06:02.613
which registers the amount of care
or lack of care it's given.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.657
These readings
will determine your grades.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.868
As you can see,
the babies exhibit

06:07.952 --> 06:11.080
a wide range of emotions
and expressions of need.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.666
It's your job to fulfill those needs.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.876
Ms. Pinto, what happens if we drop it?

06:16.919 --> 06:18.462
You fail.

06:22.925 --> 06:26.303
They're babies, Mr. McGinnis.
You must be gentle with them.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.846
How do I turn it off?

06:28.222 --> 06:32.476
You can't, but you can quiet it down
by rocking it, just like a real baby.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.395
Yeah, McGinnis, get with the program.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.741
Turns out she's not stealing
just any rubies.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.868
They're all part of a set
she stole once before.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.538
<i>And now that she's out of prison,
she wants them back.</i>

06:52.621 --> 06:54.248
So much for rehabilitation.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.791
Ma's very determined.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.960
And that makes her and her boys
very dangerous.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.712
<i>Your ride's on its way.</i>

07:01.213 --> 07:02.631
I'll meet it on the roof.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.552
- Blade!
- Here. You take him.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.014
- Blade, you can't just...
- I didn't realize how much it cried.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.891
Besides, I have a date
with Jurgen tonight.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.810
We can't exactly take
the thing along, can we?

07:14.893 --> 07:17.646
But I had it all day, and I've got
something important to do.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.148
I don't care.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.361
<i>My instruments say
you're only doing 180.</i>

07:24.445 --> 07:25.821
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

07:26.905 --> 07:29.491
Uh, she's feeling
a little sluggish tonight.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.575
Didn't want to push it.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.621
<i>- What</i> was <i>that?</i>
- Nothing.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.090
<i>The ruby earrings from the set
are part of an estate sale tomorrow.</i>

07:45.716 --> 07:47.092
Sure called this one right.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.353
<i>What's going on there?
Is that a baby?</i>

07:58.646 --> 07:59.647
Um...

07:59.730 --> 08:01.482
<i>You brought a baby with you?</i>

08:01.565 --> 08:03.275
It's not what you think. Really.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.278
Terry, is there something
you need to tell me?

08:06.445 --> 08:10.032
It's not a child. It's...
Turn on your vidlink.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.118
<i>See? It's not a real baby.</i>

08:13.452 --> 08:15.245
<i>Why am I not reassured?</i>

09:03.502 --> 09:05.337
I hope that computer of yours
can't smell.

09:24.565 --> 09:28.485
- Was that Batman? Dumpster diving?
- A fella's gotta eat.

09:33.949 --> 09:34.950
Something's wrong.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.327
He's not eating. Why isn't he eating?

09:38.537 --> 09:40.956
Maybe because you're trying to feed him
through his nose.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.668
- Does yours say anything yet?

09:45.002 --> 09:47.463
I swear,
I heard little Howie say, "Papa."

09:49.673 --> 09:51.425
I mean, it sounded like "Papa."

09:51.508 --> 09:54.636
It'll be a long time before I'll be
wanting anyone to call me that.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.221
It's not so bad, McGinnis.

09:56.305 --> 09:57.305
Really.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.349
Here's the bio and civics.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.560
Thanks, hon. How about the math?

10:02.478 --> 10:04.354
It's coming. Stop nagging.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.023
I get it, you're doing his homework

10:06.106 --> 10:07.625
so you don't have to
take care of the baby.

10:07.649 --> 10:11.069
We opted for the traditional marriage.
One breadwinner, one homemaker.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.280
Beats algebra.

10:14.698 --> 10:15.741
Come on, Howard.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.659
You promised
I could have him for a while.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.497
Okay, but he just ate,
so he's going to be a little fussy.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.831
And keep him covered.

10:22.915 --> 10:24.750
I thought I heard
a bit of a sneeze before.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.126
- And...
- Howard.

10:27.211 --> 10:29.505
And how's our little A-plus doing?

10:29.588 --> 10:31.715
He's sleeping.
You'll hardly know he's around.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.132
Forget it.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.302
Jurgen has this new vid
I want to check out.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.222
I want a divorce!

10:42.017 --> 10:44.162
Do you have to keep lugging
that thing around with you?

10:44.186 --> 10:45.562
I need the grade.

10:45.646 --> 10:49.316
Even real parents with real children
find ways to get away for a night.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.818
I tired leaving it with my mom,

10:50.901 --> 10:52.986
but she said she was too young
to be a grandmother.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.322
- What about your brother?
- I tried that, too.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.449
Then I caught him
shooting rubber bands at it.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.952
Hey. You know, maybe you could...

11:02.120 --> 11:03.372
Never mind.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.707
It's the one piece
they haven't gotten yet.

11:05.791 --> 11:08.001
Part of a display
at the Museum of Fashion.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.587
You think baby could
keep its mouth shut for one night?

11:10.671 --> 11:14.341
I gave it a double feeding,
changed it, kept it awake all afternoon.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.344
Believe me,
it'll be off in nap city for hours.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.363
This will be perfect.
Now, please, don't wake up.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.130
Ha! The tramp. Get it off her.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.592
Carl.

11:58.302 --> 11:59.761
There could've been an alarm.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.346
There wasn't.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.641
Now, let's get out of here
before pointy ears shows his mug again.

12:05.809 --> 12:06.727
Too late.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.812
This is getting old, Batman.

12:08.896 --> 12:09.896
Look who's talking.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.171
Come on, let's go. You, too, Carl.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.844
Brute strength always loses out
to technique, Carl.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.262
Didn't Mama ever tell you that?

12:42.346 --> 12:44.097
Mama!

12:47.434 --> 12:48.977
Nobody hurts my boys.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.491
Leave him. We got what we came for.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.356
The baby.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.327
No sign of him anywhere.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.537
I've lost him.

13:48.996 --> 13:49.996
Him?

13:50.038 --> 13:52.374
That's a doll you're talking about,
not a life.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.418
It's my life, if it's lost.

13:54.835 --> 13:58.213
I'll have to take family studies again!
Have you ever taken family studies?

13:59.589 --> 14:01.675
Poor kid's gonna cry till he shuts down.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.094
Its cries are computer generated,
aren't they?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.595
<i>Yeah.</i> 80?

14:05.679 --> 14:06.847
That would mean the cries

14:06.930 --> 14:09.433
would have certain
quantifiable digital properties.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.060
Then I can set the Batmobile
to scan for them, can't I?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.186
Uh-huh.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.230
Unless they've already
made an omelet out of him.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.481
Oh, <i>hey.</i>

14:19.526 --> 14:21.194
Well, boys, we did it.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.032
Got the whole set.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.618
Oh, yeah, we did it all right,

14:28.702 --> 14:30.537
but while we were
wasting time with this,

14:30.620 --> 14:33.665
we could have stolen stuff
worth ten times as much.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.627
Nothing could be worth
more than these jewels.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.546
You hear me? Nothing!

14:39.629 --> 14:42.924
This is the first swag
your father and I ever stole together.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.760
We swore we'd never fence it.

14:45.969 --> 14:50.557
It's all I have left of him
now that he's... gone.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.477
But, Ma, Dad's not dead.
He just ran off with...

14:53.560 --> 14:55.604
Hey!

14:55.937 --> 14:57.731
Don't ever talk that way
about your father.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.526
What's that?

15:08.241 --> 15:10.577
It's a baby. Sort of.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.497
I can't make it stop.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.248
Here, give it to me.
I can figure it out.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.713
I got the signal! Going to follow it.

15:21.797 --> 15:25.842
Terry, remember, it's not worth
risking your life for an egg.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.603
Here. Give it to Mama.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.397
Kind of reminds me
of when you two were little.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.234
Get rid of it.

15:49.241 --> 15:51.910
- You sure? It's kind of cute.
- Toss it!

15:58.166 --> 16:00.127
But, Ma, maybe we could sell it.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.588
- Carl, I'm getting angry.
- Okay, okay.

16:03.672 --> 16:04.673
Sorry, kid.

16:20.897 --> 16:21.897
Company!

16:22.941 --> 16:25.235
I want him out of the picture, for good.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.427
Never mind. Let's grab the loot
and get out of here.

16:56.641 --> 16:57.641
Oh?

17:03.106 --> 17:04.566
Daddy's got to go to work now.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.165
- Ma!
- I see him. Hang on.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.433
Ahh!

17:59.454 --> 18:00.497
Uh... Uh...

18:03.083 --> 18:04.876
This is how I always pictured it.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.003
Me and my boys
carrying on the family business.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.140
We're losing power.
I got to put her down.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.123
No!

19:36.968 --> 19:38.428
Mmm.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.860
According to this data,

19:53.943 --> 19:56.071
most of you
did borderline jobs as parents.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.990
- Mainly C's.
- But, Ms. Pinto?

19:59.074 --> 20:01.159
Yes, Howard, you and Dana fed yours

20:01.242 --> 20:03.578
and rocked it
and gave it plenty of nap time

20:03.661 --> 20:05.663
but a baby needs more than that.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.166
Its mind needs to be stimulated, too.

20:08.249 --> 20:11.753
And according to this printout,
only one baby was fully stimulated,

20:12.170 --> 20:14.172
the one belonging to Terry and Blade.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.174
Congratulations, Mr. McGinnis.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.177
Who knew you'd turn out to be
such ideal father material?

20:21.596 --> 20:22.847
Terry!
