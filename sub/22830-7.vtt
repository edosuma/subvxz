20:40.864 --> 20:41.615
{\an3}Do what?

20:41.698 --> 20:43.325
{\an1}I don't wanna
go on this date.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.619
{\an5}Okay.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.619
To be honest with you.

20:45.702 --> 20:46.828
{\an5}Okay.

20:45.702 --> 20:46.828
To tell you
the truth.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.164
Not because it's corny
or anything like that.

20:49.247 --> 20:50.499
{\an1}It's more so you're
just talking about your ex.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.126
{\an1}Out there, you called him
a week and a half ago?

20:54.878 --> 20:55.963
{\an1}You called him
a week and a half ago, right?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.339
{\an5}Yeah.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.339
{\an1}Yeah.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.341
And then you called him

20:59.424 --> 21:00.968
{\an1}and you told him that
you missed him or whatever.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.094
You said that that was just--

21:02.177 --> 21:03.845
you were being stupid
and stuff like that.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.931
But you still call him
just to check up on him

21:06.014 --> 21:08.809
{\an4}and also see if he has
mail at the house?

21:06.014 --> 21:08.809
I don't call him to
check up on him.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.060
{\an1}Just fill me in just
a little bit more

21:10.143 --> 21:11.353
{\an4}on what's
going on because...

21:10.143 --> 21:11.353
Oh my gosh.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.813
... you don't really
sound like the girl

21:12.896 --> 21:14.022
{\an1}who wants, like,
a serious relationship

21:14.106 --> 21:16.191
if you're calling your ex

21:16.274 --> 21:18.110
{\an1}a week and a half ago
to talk

21:18.193 --> 21:20.195
{\an1}and stuff like that,
or-- or whatever it is.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.739
{\an1}I don't know, it just seems
like a red flag is,

21:22.823 --> 21:24.700
like, to the max.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.326
{\an1}Whenever a girl is still
calling her ex

21:26.410 --> 21:28.829
{\an1}to see what's going on
or see how everything's going,

21:28.912 --> 21:30.455
{\an1}or you call him up when you're
drunk 'cause you miss him,

21:30.539 --> 21:33.375
{\an1}I don't know, that just
seems like a red flag to me.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.376
(Nilsa)
I finally found a guy

21:34.459 --> 21:35.293
I want to invest my time in,

21:35.377 --> 21:36.378
and that's how
he does me?

21:36.461 --> 21:38.714
Like, that is
so messed up.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.549
I literally haven't even
thought about him once

21:40.632 --> 21:41.717
since I've met you.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.927
{\an1}It just seems a little...
sketchy.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.512
{\an1}If you called him
a week and a half ago--

21:45.595 --> 21:46.930
{\an1}you met me a week ago,
right?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.140
It was two weeks ago.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.558
It was Sun--
two weeks ago Sunday.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.809
Two weeks ago, right?

21:50.892 --> 21:52.602
And I think I even
told you I had a bad day.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.895
I said, "We all have
our bad days,"

21:53.979 --> 21:55.731
and I had
a bad day on Sunday.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.357
No, I get that, but I'm
just saying it's like--

21:57.441 --> 21:58.900
{\an5}That was last week
I told you that.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.900
You met me a week.

21:58.984 --> 21:59.985
{\an1}You met me
a week ago, right?

22:00.068 --> 22:01.111
Yes.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.529
Do feelings just
fade in a week?

22:02.612 --> 22:03.572
{\an1}I-- I--
I don't know.

22:03.655 --> 22:04.740
When you meet someone,
yes.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.074
{\an1}It just seems a little
fishy, that's all.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.743
{\an1}It's just--
it's just weird.

22:07.826 --> 22:08.785
(Nilsa)
I'm so confused.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.911
I'm, like, at a loss
for words.

22:09.995 --> 22:10.912
I don't even
know what to say.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.372
You've hyped me up all week.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.166
You drive all the way
here from Jacksonville

22:14.249 --> 22:15.625
just to take my heart
and rip it out?

22:16.835 --> 22:19.087
{\an4}(Nilsa)
This is why I don't do this.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.087
I just...

22:19.171 --> 22:21.048
I just wanted to be
honest with you.

22:21.131 --> 22:21.423
{\an5}I apologize.

22:21.131 --> 22:21.423
I just wanna go home now.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.678
This is why I don't-- this is
why I don't give guys chances.

22:29.848 --> 22:30.599
(sighing)

22:35.729 --> 22:36.855
♪♪

22:38.023 --> 22:39.441
{\an1}This is why
I don't give guys chances.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.484
(Aimee)
What?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.069
{\an1}He doesn't wanna go on
the date anymore

22:42.152 --> 22:44.029
{\an1}because I called
my ex two weeks ago,

22:44.112 --> 22:45.155
before I met him.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.366
What?

22:48.450 --> 22:49.826
He just said that?

22:49.910 --> 22:50.827
(sniffling)

22:50.911 --> 22:51.912
He said it's a red flag.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.455
{\an1}He's like, "You don't seem
like someone

22:53.538 --> 22:54.790
who wants to get serious."

22:54.873 --> 22:56.917
{\an1}We-- we haven't even
talked about what we are

22:57.000 --> 22:59.044
or are intentions with
each other or anything.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.545
{\an1}I just met him
a week ago.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.505
That's bull(bleep).

23:01.588 --> 23:02.964
{\an1}Like,
what the (bleep)?

23:03.048 --> 23:03.673
It's stupid.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.967
Yeah, it is,
it's stupid.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.469
(Aimee)
What is wrong with people?

23:07.552 --> 23:09.471
Don't (bleep) make
no (bleep) date

23:09.554 --> 23:11.640
{\an8}and bring your
ugly-ass unicorn

23:11.723 --> 23:13.850
{\an8}and then tell her that you can't
talk to her no more

23:13.934 --> 23:16.186
{\an8}because she called her ex
a week before she met you.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.188
That don't even make sense.

23:19.898 --> 23:20.941
Where is my brother?!

23:21.024 --> 23:22.776
Huh!

23:23.860 --> 23:25.320
Ahh!

23:25.403 --> 23:26.321
What's up, buddy?

23:26.404 --> 23:27.280
Sweaty piece of (bleep)!

23:27.364 --> 23:28.323
{\an1}Goddamn,
don't touch me.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.324
I look fresh.

23:29.407 --> 23:30.242
{\an1}Leave me alone,
bra.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.326
(Gus)
What's up, man?

23:31.409 --> 23:32.702
I missed you, man.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.204
{\an5}Good to
see you again.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.204
Very good to see you.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.413
You guys looking
pumped as (bleep).

23:35.497 --> 23:38.291
{\an5}Make enough for two.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.291
Got it.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.459
I'll just make
a jumbo shake.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.836
{\an1}Please do.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.838
How did Nilsa react to you
coming back to the house?

23:42.921 --> 23:44.506
Oh, it was super kosher
when I-- when I got in here.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.591
And then, uh, she was
talking about

23:46.675 --> 23:48.426
how she was...
drunk-calling her ex

23:48.510 --> 23:51.346
and telling him that she
missed him.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.265
{\an6}Wait, what?

23:51.429 --> 23:53.265
Yeah.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.015
{\an5}Where did that
even come from?

23:53.348 --> 23:54.015
That's (bleep)
I'm saying.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.351
{\an1}Oh my God.

23:56.434 --> 23:57.644
She was telling you that?

23:57.727 --> 23:59.020
{\an5}Yes.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.020
Oh, dear God.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.105
Isn't that a kind of
stupid thing to tell somebody?

24:00.188 --> 24:01.356
I don't know, maybe.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.358
That's the stupidest thing
you can tell somebody.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.234
{\an5}Maybe-- maybe, I don't know,
I could be wrong.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.234
The stupidest.

24:04.317 --> 24:07.696
I really like that guy!

24:07.779 --> 24:10.198
{\an1}I haven't liked somebody
in a long-ass time!

24:10.282 --> 24:10.866
Well, do you
like him now?

24:10.949 --> 24:12.325
{\an1}Yes!

24:12.409 --> 24:14.536
It's just not
worth it for me.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.579
I'm not gonna waste
the time on...

24:15.662 --> 24:18.039
somebody who
calls up their ex.

24:18.123 --> 24:18.582
{\an1}No, I don't
blame you at all.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.041
I wouldn't either.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.376
{\an1}(Nilsa)
This whole time,

24:21.459 --> 24:22.836
every single day this week
when we went out to the bar

24:22.919 --> 24:24.546
I never even once
looked at a guy.

24:24.629 --> 24:25.463
(Aimee)
I know that.

24:25.547 --> 24:26.548
{\an1}I was like this is
so silly of me

24:26.631 --> 24:28.133
{\an1}to like this guy
this much, this soon.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.676
{\an1}I had sex with
this guy

24:29.759 --> 24:32.596
on the first (bleep)
night I ever met him.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.389
I'm such an idiot.

24:34.472 --> 24:36.057
{\an5}(Nilsa)
I'm just trying to
hold it together.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.642
{\an8}I am over my ex.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.060
{\an8}I did nothing wrong.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.478
{\an8}What more did he want?

24:40.562 --> 24:42.981
I told myself I'm not gonna
get drunk that much tonight,

24:43.064 --> 24:43.982
but now, dude...

24:44.065 --> 24:45.150
(laughing)

24:45.233 --> 24:46.401
... I'm gonna get
(bleep).

24:46.484 --> 24:47.194
{\an4}(Gus)
You should've been
with us last night.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.403
Last night went weird.

24:48.486 --> 24:49.654
{\an5}We got weird
last night.

24:48.486 --> 24:49.654
You guys got weird?

24:49.738 --> 24:49.821
Did you guys
sleep together or what?

24:51.615 --> 24:52.407
{\an1}No.

24:52.490 --> 24:53.909
I heard you
couldn't close.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.869
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
Bro...

24:53.992 --> 24:55.869
No, that is so...

24:55.952 --> 24:56.745
{\an1}that is so not
even true.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.371
(Nilsa)
Can I talk to you?

24:58.455 --> 24:59.623
Yeah.

25:01.750 --> 25:02.876
You wanna go
somewhere private?

25:02.959 --> 25:03.835
{\an5}Yes, please.

25:02.959 --> 25:03.835
Okay, that's fine.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.171
Would you like
a protein shake?

25:06.254 --> 25:07.339
{\an3}No thanks.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.634
{\an5}(Josh)
Protein shake?
Really, Gus?

25:10.717 --> 25:11.885
Protein shakes
make me feel better.

25:13.637 --> 25:14.554
{\an1}What's up?

25:14.638 --> 25:16.056
Like, you really
don't wanna--

25:16.139 --> 25:17.682
like, any--
like, I don't understand.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.600
I thought-- like, I was
going upstairs

25:18.683 --> 25:21.102
to get ready
and everything.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.687
And I was too.

25:22.771 --> 25:23.521
And then what happened
in between?

25:23.605 --> 25:26.066
{\an1}Well, you told me
in the pool

25:26.149 --> 25:28.109
{\an1}that you
called your ex up.

25:28.193 --> 25:28.944
{\an1}You just don't call
your ex up.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.487
{\an1}I'm sorry.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.571
{\an1}Then why didn't you get out
of the pool just then?

25:31.655 --> 25:33.615
{\an1}We were still in
the pool having a good time.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.242
{\an1}'Cause I was still just
trying to process

25:35.325 --> 25:36.368
{\an1}everything that
was going through my head,

25:36.451 --> 25:37.619
{\an1}whether I should say,
hey, you know,

25:37.702 --> 25:39.955
{\an1}this is a thing or it's not
a thing for me, you know?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.373
So what are you
worried about?

25:41.456 --> 25:43.041
I'm just worried
about that, one--

25:43.124 --> 25:44.042
That I'm not ready?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.460
{\an1}One, yeah,
that you're not ready.

25:45.543 --> 25:46.461
I am.

25:46.544 --> 25:48.380
{\an1}I don't know about
that, though.

25:48.463 --> 25:49.839
{\an1}If you called him
two weeks ago, right,

25:49.923 --> 25:51.633
{\an1}told him that you
missed him.

25:51.716 --> 25:52.801
I didn't tell him
I missed him.

25:52.884 --> 25:53.927
{\an1}That's what you
said in the pool.

25:54.010 --> 25:54.970
When I met you, like...

25:55.053 --> 25:57.472
like, I don't even think
about him anymore.

25:57.555 --> 25:59.140
I could be in
the worst mood

25:59.224 --> 26:00.267
and then someone
brings you up,

26:00.350 --> 26:01.559
my whole mood changes.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.603
When you call me,
I'm so excited.

26:03.687 --> 26:04.896
I, like, wanna
run around the house

26:04.980 --> 26:05.981
like a little girl,
screaming.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.023
When you were
coming today,

26:07.107 --> 26:08.566
I was so excited
and so nervous.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.485
Like, I wanted to
throw up I was so excited.

26:10.568 --> 26:11.653
I'm not doing that
with my ex.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.988
{\an1}I don't give
a (bleep) about him anymore.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.156
I met you and I like you.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.283
{\an1}I'm sorry.

26:21.579 --> 26:22.163
I'm going home.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.082
{\an1}Have fun.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.877
{\an1}(Aimee)
Nilsa, come here.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.170
I'm going home.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.172
You are not
going home.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.590
{\an4}Nilsa!

26:31.256 --> 26:32.590
That's, like,
the last straw.

26:32.674 --> 26:33.508

{\an7}Bitch, you ain't
gonna talk to me like that!

41:20.769 --> 41:21.812
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Next time on
MTV's "Floribama Shore"...

41:21.896 --> 41:24.732
{\an8}I'll beat the (bleep)
out of you, bitch!

41:24.815 --> 41:26.567
{\an8}(Nilsa)
The rage Aimee has towards
Kirk is scary.

41:26.650 --> 41:26.817
{\an8}I don't know
what's gonna happen.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.030
{\an7}(Kirk)
She's lucky that's not
her (bleep) face.

41:31.113 --> 41:32.364
{\an8}(shrieking)

41:32.448 --> 41:33.365
{\an8}(Candace)
I feel like my parents

41:33.449 --> 41:35.534
{\an8}turned their life around
when I was born

41:35.618 --> 41:37.703
{\an8}'cause I have never
seen them like this before.

41:37.786 --> 41:39.371
{\an7}They're drinking
more than me.

41:37.786 --> 41:39.371
{\an5}I think they are.
