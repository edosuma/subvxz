Bartokomous,
where is Mr. Glover’s mail?

01:51.578 --> 01:53.847
I’m proud to say
that the mail

01:53.880 --> 01:56.282
for the new executive
vice president

01:56.316 --> 01:59.820
was delivered first thing
this morning by sincerely yours.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.321
Oh! Darn it.

02:01.354 --> 02:03.824
I wanted to deliver
Mr. Glover’s mail myself.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.192
Never mind.
I’ll send him a gift.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.528
Oh, he’ll like that.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.162
Something classy.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.164
I wonder
if "Bambi" is available.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.568
I’m sure it is.

02:14.601 --> 02:17.170
I‐I returned
my copy this morning.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.845
It’s kind of fun
watching Gorpley grovel.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.580
Well, I think
we’ve all been a little nervous

02:26.613 --> 02:28.882
ever since Mr. Wainwright
gave Glover carte blanche

02:28.915 --> 02:30.584
to reorganize
the newspaper.

02:30.617 --> 02:31.618
Question, cousin.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.454
Why would Mr. Wainwright
give him <i>carte blanche</i>

02:34.487 --> 02:37.824
when more businesses worldwide
accept Visa and MasterCard?

02:39.626 --> 02:41.261
No, Balki,
carte blanche means

02:41.294 --> 02:43.229
Glover can make
any changes he wants to.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.832
And that includes
hiring and firing.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.768
Well, at least
I can rest easy.

of the dead wood

02:58.244 --> 02:59.846

Mr. Wainwright.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.615
That’s‐that’s him.
That’s Mr. Glover.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.349
And there’s
a bright young reporter

03:03.383 --> 03:05.719
in the financial department,
Craig Howard

03:05.752 --> 03:08.488
who should have his own column,
if that’s alright with you, sir.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.923
Whatever you think’s
best, Glover.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.491
If you can do
for us what you did

03:11.525 --> 03:13.493
for the St. Louis examiner,
I’ll be a happy man.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.261
You can count on it,
Mr. Wainwright.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.298
You just enjoy your week
at the publisher’s conference.

03:18.331 --> 03:19.966
Have a nice trip,
Mr. Wainwright.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.735
Thank you, Appleton.

03:21.768 --> 03:22.969
Appleton.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.706

03:25.739 --> 03:28.509
Oh, so you wrote
the article

03:28.542 --> 03:31.477

in the sanitation department?

Good job.

Mr. Glover, thank you.

Oh, uh,

Rupert Murdoch at the conference

about your readers.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.966
Oh, yes.

aren’t there?

03:55.602 --> 03:58.739
Yes. But unfortunately,
they’re all over 40.

to a younger crowd now

Miss Lydia,
are‐are you okay?

04:11.952 --> 04:13.319
You want,
you want to sit down?

04:13.353 --> 04:15.789
Sit down?
Who’s got time to sit down?

04:15.822 --> 04:17.757
If I‐I don’t start
writing about pimples

04:17.791 --> 04:19.760

I’m history!

04:24.765 --> 04:28.334
Cousin, Miss Lydia
seemed really upset.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.302
Yeah, upset, too bad.

04:29.335 --> 04:32.939
Did you hear what Glover
said about my article?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.508
Balki, this could be it.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.042
I know Craig Howard
in financial

04:36.076 --> 04:37.477
I’m twice
the writer he is.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.945
And he is getting
his own column!

04:38.979 --> 04:41.882
Maybe you’ll get
two columns!

04:41.915 --> 04:44.317
Balki, the point is,
if Glover’s moved him up

04:44.350 --> 04:45.652
I can’t be far behind.

04:45.686 --> 04:49.823
Cousin, maybe your ship
has finally hit the fan!

04:53.459 --> 04:55.328
Oh good.
I’m glad you’re still here.

04:55.361 --> 04:57.798
I wanted to talk to you
about a promotion.

04:57.831 --> 05:02.402
I’ve created a new department
here called Editorial Services

05:02.435 --> 05:04.370
and I think
the most qualified person

05:04.404 --> 05:05.939
to head up
that department is you.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.041
‐Thank you, sir.
‐Not you.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.043
I was talking to him.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.714
Congratulations,
Bartokomous.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.816
You’re an executive.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.086
You! You’re fired.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.728
[instrumental music]

05:32.165 --> 05:34.601
But why did Mr. Grover
give you such a big office?

05:34.635 --> 05:37.638
Because he had to, it’s the only
place they could fit

05:37.671 --> 05:39.606
my giant, humongous desk.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.544
Have you seen
his desk, Larry?

05:43.577 --> 05:45.979
No, I was busy
working all day

05:46.012 --> 05:49.550
at my little desk in the...

05:49.583 --> 05:52.085
...in the giant,
humongous basement.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.589
Tell me about
the chair again, Balki.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.091
Well,
it’s a rolling chair.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.826
And it’s just like
Cousin Larry’s

05:59.860 --> 06:01.728
only it has
all its wheels.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.998
And...it’s covered
with leather.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.800
Before we get
into fabrics

06:06.833 --> 06:09.002
uh, does anybody
want some more coffee?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.203
‐Oh, no.
‐No, thanks.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.138
Well, I’ll make some anyway
’cause I wanna be alert

06:12.172 --> 06:14.140
when we discuss
the carpeting.

06:15.141 --> 06:16.309
Oh, the carpeting!

it’s an Anso 4 thread nylon’

’and, uh, did I mention
it’s Wear‐Dated?’

06:23.149 --> 06:26.820
Um, Larry, is Balki’s
promotion bothering you?

06:26.853 --> 06:28.488
Well, I‐I just don’t get it.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.824
I mean this morning
he was working in the mail room.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.793
And this afternoon
he’s got a huge office

06:32.826 --> 06:34.728
on the executive floor.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.130
Well, maybe you’re a little
jealous of Balki.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.733
Oh, Jennifer,
please.

06:39.766 --> 06:40.967
Please.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.738
I mean, do you think
I’d be jealous of Balki

06:44.771 --> 06:46.873
just because
he has his own office?

06:46.907 --> 06:47.774
Well, I‐‐

06:47.808 --> 06:50.476
Deep pile carpeting
and a huge desk...

06:51.512 --> 06:52.613
Larry, I just felt
that there was‐‐

06:52.646 --> 06:56.149
And a window that looks out
over the Chicago skyline

06:56.182 --> 06:58.885
so he can sit
in his Corinthian leather chair

06:58.919 --> 07:00.220
and enjoy
the sunset, ha ha.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.956
I mean, do you think
that would make me jealous?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.593
Yes.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.530
Okay, you’re right.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.800
But I’m not gonna let
any petty jealousy

07:13.834 --> 07:17.170
stop me from being happy
for my best friend.

07:17.203 --> 07:20.874
You know, I think
powerful men are very sexy.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.910
You do?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.547
I do.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.884
Balki, buddy.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.187
I just want you to know

07:34.220 --> 07:36.523
that no one is happier
for you than I am.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.059
Oh, thank you, cousin.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.227
And if anybody
deserves a break, you do.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.196
Oh, cousin, thank you.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.932
Listen...I know
I don’t need to say this.

07:45.966 --> 07:50.070
But I want you to know that
my new executive lifestyle

07:50.103 --> 07:53.707
is not going to change
our friendship in any way.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.141
I know that.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.643
And to celebrate
your promotion

07:56.677 --> 07:58.178
I’d like to take you
to lunch tomorrow.

‐Interesting outfit.
‐Oh, thank you.

I’m trying to
dress for excess.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.711
Well, you’re succeeding.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.313
Well, Balki, th‐this
place is incredible.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.548
Oh, thank you, cousin.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.618
Cousin, cousin, you‐you come,
look at this. Look at this.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.919
They are so generous.

08:38.952 --> 08:42.188
They give me a refrigerator
and a microwave.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.925
I’m conducting
an experiment

08:44.958 --> 08:47.127
to see how fast
I can boil water

08:47.160 --> 08:48.962
and then freeze it.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.834
My personal best
is 18 minutes.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.301
Well, I guess
the 15‐minute barrier

08:55.335 --> 08:57.303
is right around the corner.

08:59.139 --> 09:03.577
And, cousin, as if all of this
weren’t enough, look at this.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.078
Look at this!

09:05.812 --> 09:07.914
They gave me...

09:07.948 --> 09:09.916
...my very own...

09:09.950 --> 09:11.618
...salad maker!

09:17.257 --> 09:20.060
Balki, that’s
a paper shredder.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.832
A paper salad?

09:27.801 --> 09:30.737
Interesting concept.

09:30.771 --> 09:34.107
I guess with a light vinaigrette
and some croutons, why not?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.376
Well, it sounds tasty

09:36.409 --> 09:38.378
but a‐actually
I’m here on business.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.381
Mr. Glover assigned me to
interview you for the newspaper.

09:41.414 --> 09:45.218
‐Get out of the city!
‐No, I’m serious.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.853
He wants me to trace
what he calls

09:46.887 --> 09:49.055
your meteoric rise
from the mail room

09:49.089 --> 09:51.692
to head
of Editorial Services.

09:51.725 --> 09:56.129
Well, why don’t
we step on over here...

09:56.162 --> 09:57.297
...to what I like to call

09:57.330 --> 10:00.333
my "Sitting down
and talking area?"

10:01.768 --> 10:04.671
And get up
close and personal.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.906
Great.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.242
Uh, maybe you could tell me what
the head of Editorial Services

10:09.275 --> 10:10.844

10:10.877 --> 10:14.114

where to begin.

10:18.785 --> 10:23.156

in a nudist colony.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.137
of the Chamber of Commerce
are outside.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.406
Would you mind
having your picture taken?

11:13.439 --> 11:15.341
Would I mind?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.443
Does Miss Mypos
have a moustache?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.147
I’ll‐I’ll be right back.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.316
Mr. Glover...

11:23.349 --> 11:24.551
...I’m glad you’re here.

11:24.585 --> 11:26.953
I’m‐I’m having a little trouble
with this assignment.

11:26.987 --> 11:30.090
Uh, uh, maybe you can clear
some things up for me.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.758
I’d be happy to.

11:31.792 --> 11:35.762
What exactly does the head
of Editorial Services do?

11:36.930 --> 11:39.900
Well, he’s a...

11:39.933 --> 11:44.170
...liaison between editorial
operations and management

11:44.204 --> 11:46.372
providing a vital source
of input to reduce friction

11:46.406 --> 11:48.208
and enhance efficiency.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.515
And how precisely
does Balki do that?

11:54.548 --> 11:57.050
Well, in a, uh,
variety of ways

11:57.083 --> 11:59.219
by networking
within the infrastructure

11:59.252 --> 12:01.254
and interfacing
with the private sector.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.324
I’m sorry, Mr. Glover

12:04.357 --> 12:07.528
but that‐that sounds
like a lot of double‐talk

12:07.561 --> 12:10.230
for somebody
who’s got no job at all.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.999
Okay, Appleton, okay.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.868
Let me clear
something up for you.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.403
Have you ever heard
of a government program

12:17.437 --> 12:20.006
called American Dream?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.545
Well, sure, It’s a training
program for immigrants.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.246
Helps them acquire
the skills necessary

12:26.279 --> 12:28.281
to advance
in the business community.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.950
Hmm, that’s the one.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.952
Well,
I promoted Bartokomous

12:31.985 --> 12:35.321
as a part
of that program.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.559
As far as I can tell, you’re not
training Balki to do anything.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.061
[chuckling]
It’s a waste of time.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.097
Now, it’s much easier
to have you write an article

12:44.130 --> 12:46.833
that makes it look like
I trained him.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.804
Well, Mr. Glover,
what you’re doing

12:50.837 --> 12:53.373
is...tokenism.

12:53.406 --> 12:57.177
I‐I can’t write a story
to help you do that.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.480
Well, okay.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.182
If you,
if you can’t write it

13:02.215 --> 13:05.218
well, uh, I can find,
uh, someone else who can

13:05.251 --> 13:07.287
while you look
for another job.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.124
Think about it.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.134
[instrumental music]

13:28.074 --> 13:30.511
Jennifer,
it’s just not right.

13:30.544 --> 13:33.179
What Glover has done
is take a valuable program

13:33.213 --> 13:35.181
that helps people
who could use a break

13:35.215 --> 13:38.552
and turned it into
a meaningless showcase.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.587
Larry, you have to tell
Balki what’s happening.

13:40.621 --> 13:42.589
Well, I’ve tried to
everyday this week

13:42.623 --> 13:44.991
but he’s so happy.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.193
I just hate
to burst his bubble.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.563
Well, maybe he’s not as happy
as you think he is.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.568
I am the happiest Mypiot

13:54.601 --> 13:57.137
in the entire solar plexus!

13:58.639 --> 14:01.141
Then again,
what do I know?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.009
Well, I have to go.
I’ll see you later.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.311
Jennifer, Jennifer...

14:05.345 --> 14:07.648
...we don’t see enough
of each other anymore.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.050
Have your people
call my people

14:10.083 --> 14:12.619
and we’ll do lunch?

14:12.653 --> 14:14.087
I’ll do that.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.923
‐Bye.
‐Bye.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.961
Well, Balki...

14:20.994 --> 14:23.964
...it seems you’re really
happy with your new job.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.432
Oh, come on,
cousin. Get real.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.402
I’m living
the life of Pat Riley!

14:29.435 --> 14:32.673
How could I not be happy?

14:32.706 --> 14:36.943
I mean, how could
I not be happy?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.378
I guess
you got everything.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.981
I sure do.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.383
[sobbing]
So how could I
not be happy?

14:45.151 --> 14:46.553
Balki, Balki

14:46.587 --> 14:49.590
you mean, you’re not happy?

14:49.623 --> 14:51.424
No, I’m not.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.394
Well, why not?

14:55.495 --> 14:57.163
I don’t know.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.568
I know I should be.

15:01.602 --> 15:04.971
I know I’ve got everything
a Mypiot could wish for

15:05.005 --> 15:07.040
[sobbing]
but something’s missing.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.011
What?

15:14.615 --> 15:16.983
[sobbing]
Something’s missing.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.554
What?

15:23.389 --> 15:25.458
‐Something’s missing.
‐Oh, something’s missing.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.193
Well, yes, Balki.

15:29.663 --> 15:33.099
What’s missing
is a real job.

15:33.133 --> 15:37.170
But I have a real job.
I’m head of Editorial Services.

15:37.203 --> 15:41.141
And what exactly does the head
of Editorial Services do?

15:43.109 --> 15:44.477
I don’t know.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.050
Every time I ask
Mr. Glover what my job is...

15:50.083 --> 15:52.052
...I get
my picture taken.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.089
I’m beginning to feel

15:56.122 --> 15:58.659
like the Christie Brinkley
of "The Chronicle."

16:00.794 --> 16:03.964
Well, Balki, I’m afraid
that’s exactly what you are.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.601
I am?

16:07.634 --> 16:11.204
Oh, cousin, I hope they
don’t have a Swimsuit Issue.

16:13.239 --> 16:17.143
No, Balki, what I mean is,
Glover has created this job

16:17.177 --> 16:19.345
so it’ll look like
"The Chronicle" is complying

16:19.379 --> 16:21.682
with a government program
that helps immigrants.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.284
But there really
is no job at all.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.320
It’s a fake, a sham,
and‐and you’re just a...

16:27.353 --> 16:30.356
...a puppet
in Glover’s sleazy scheme.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.559
Oh, cousin,
that is the best news

16:32.593 --> 16:35.128
I’ve heard since they
brought back "The Munsters."

16:37.664 --> 16:39.499
‐It is?
‐Yes.

16:39.533 --> 16:43.036
I thought that everyone knew
what my job was, but me.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.405
Now, I can quit
this sleazy puppet show

16:45.438 --> 16:46.673
and go back
to the mail room.

16:46.707 --> 16:48.809
No, Balki, Balki.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.711
If you do that,
Glover will just replace you

16:50.744 --> 16:52.278
with somebody else.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.615
But that
won’t solve the problem.

16:54.648 --> 16:56.482
No, it won’t.

16:56.517 --> 16:59.219
What we have to do is find
a way to get rid of Glover

16:59.252 --> 17:01.588
so the program will work
the way it’s supposed to.

17:01.622 --> 17:03.189
How we do that?

17:03.223 --> 17:06.792
Well, I think if we give
Glover enough rope...

17:06.827 --> 17:08.762
...he just
might hang himself.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.200
I’d prefer nonviolence.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.107
[instrumental music]

17:23.276 --> 17:26.146
Appleton, I’ve just
gotten off the plane.

17:26.179 --> 17:29.115
I’ve got jet lagged,
and I’ve eaten airline food.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.784
What is so important
that I come here

17:30.817 --> 17:31.885
before I go
to my office?

17:31.918 --> 17:33.654
Mr. Wainwright, we thought
you might be interested

17:33.687 --> 17:35.589
in some of the changes
Mr. Glover has made.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.391
So, I’d like you to meet the new
head of Editorial Services.

17:38.424 --> 17:41.327
Fine, have him call me.
We’ll have lunch.

17:41.361 --> 17:45.265
M‐Mr. Wainwright,
it’s me, Balki Bartokomous.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.433
You?

17:47.467 --> 17:49.770
Well, I‐I’m sure Glover
knows what he’s doing.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.304
He knows
what he’s doing.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.740
But we thought you should
know what he’s doing.

17:53.774 --> 17:55.408
Mr. Glover’s
on his way up.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.143
‐Okay.
‐Mr. Wainwright.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.211
There’s no time to explain

17:58.244 --> 17:59.412
but what Glover’s
doing is wrong.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.682
And you’re the only person
with the power to stop him.

18:01.715 --> 18:03.750
So, we were wondering
if you’d mind very much

18:03.784 --> 18:05.451
hiding under the desk?

18:06.452 --> 18:08.722
What?

18:08.755 --> 18:11.291
Well, I know it’s a strange
request but it‐it’s the only way

18:11.324 --> 18:13.293
we can prove
our case against Glover.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.729
You want me
to get under the desk?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.330
Y‐Yes, sir.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.265
If I’m wrong,
you can fire me.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.500
That’s a given.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.738
‐Mr. Glover’s here.
‐Okay, okay.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.341
I don’t believe
I’m doing this.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.412
Appleton!

18:32.445 --> 18:35.248
They told me
I would find you here.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.719
This is not the article
I told you to write.

18:38.752 --> 18:41.555
Now, you do it over,
and you do it my way.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.189
Well, I just
told the truth

18:43.223 --> 18:44.591
uh, about the way
you’re implementing

18:44.625 --> 18:46.760
the American Dream program.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.929
And I merely pointed out
that Balki isn’t getting

18:48.962 --> 18:52.332
the real opportunities the‐the
program is designed to give.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.502
Oh, well, why don’t we ask
Balki about that?

18:55.536 --> 18:57.170
Balki?

18:57.203 --> 19:00.240
Are you unhappy
in your new position here?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.409
Well,
I’m not one to complain

19:03.443 --> 19:05.912
but all I do
is get my picture taken.

19:07.781 --> 19:10.450
I’m starting to get
flashbulb burn.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.555
Mr. Glover, doesn’t
the program have something

19:14.588 --> 19:16.523
to do with
training immigrants?

19:16.557 --> 19:18.692
Oh, sure. Sure.
I could train him.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.760
But then he’d go to lunch

19:19.793 --> 19:21.728
and I’d have
to train him again.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.732
Forgive me,
Mr‐Mr. Glover.

19:25.766 --> 19:29.503
I’m‐I’m just a poor,
ignorant immigrant.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.572
English is not
my mother’s tongue.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.612
But are you saying

19:38.645 --> 19:40.747
you never had
any intention

19:40.781 --> 19:43.584
of giving me
anything to do?

19:43.617 --> 19:46.620
No. You’re doing
something, Bartokomous.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.823
You’re taking a job away
from a real American

19:49.856 --> 19:51.091
who deserves it.

19:54.961 --> 19:55.996
Oh, I see.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.463
So‐so you’re saying

19:57.497 --> 20:01.668
that if a person
is not born here

20:01.702 --> 20:04.404
then he has no right
to work here.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.508
No, no, no, no,
you foreigners can work here

20:07.541 --> 20:10.811
but the good jobs
should go to real Americans.

20:10.844 --> 20:13.246
Now, am I talking
too fast for you?

20:15.649 --> 20:18.952
Mr. Glover, you may
have been born in America

20:18.985 --> 20:21.421
but you’re not much
of an American.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.823
You’re too small
and narrow minded

20:22.856 --> 20:24.825
to know the meaning
of the word.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.993
Oh, really?

20:27.027 --> 20:29.763
Well, maybe you know
the meaning of these words...

20:29.796 --> 20:31.297
...you’re fired!

20:31.331 --> 20:33.399
I’ll do
the firing around here.

20:37.971 --> 20:41.441
Uh, M‐M‐Mr. Wainwright.
How‐how was your trip, sir?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.409
Save it, Glover.
Clean out your desk.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.580
Clean out my desk?

20:46.613 --> 20:48.715
Uh, I’m doing
a great job here.

20:48.749 --> 20:49.783
Your costs are down.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.718
Your circulation is up.

20:51.752 --> 20:53.720
There are more
important things

20:53.754 --> 20:55.822
than lower cost
and higher circulation.

20:55.856 --> 20:58.859
I’m not firing you
because you’re doing a bad job.

20:58.892 --> 21:01.027
I’m firing you
because you’re a bigot

21:01.061 --> 21:03.530
and there’s no room
in "The Chronicle" for bigots.

21:08.068 --> 21:11.004
Mr. Glover, I know you’re not
wild about government programs

21:11.037 --> 21:13.640
but you might want
to look into Unemployment.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.911
Goodbye, Mr. Glover.

21:23.950 --> 21:24.985
Mr. Glover.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.624
On your way out you can have
Maria validate your parking.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.998
That was a gutsy
thing you two did.

21:38.031 --> 21:42.836
Well, we know our way around
guts, Mr. Wainwright.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.471
I don’t know if you’ve ever
made sausage from scratch‐‐

21:45.506 --> 21:47.440
‐Balki, Balki.
‐You have to get right up‐‐

21:47.473 --> 21:52.746
Balki, Balki, Mr. Wainwright
is saying we’re brave.

21:52.779 --> 21:53.847
And I still
want you to be part

21:53.880 --> 21:55.849
of the American Dream program,
Balki.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.519
Does that mean
I have to stay in this job?

21:58.552 --> 22:01.387
Not at all. I’m sending you back
to the mail room for time being.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.624
But, Appleton, I want you
to take Bartokomous

22:03.657 --> 22:04.858
under your wing
and train him.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.060
Show him what it’s like to be
an investigative reporter.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.762
My pleasure, sir.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.764
Thank you, Mr. Wainwright.

22:12.733 --> 22:14.067
Keep up
the good work, boys.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.505
Balki, did you hear that?

22:18.539 --> 22:20.974
You are gonna get a chance
to become a real reporter!

22:21.007 --> 22:24.511
Cousin, now we are so happy,
we do the Dance of Joy!
