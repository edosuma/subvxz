00:01.583 --> 00:03.000
[Narrator] Previously onX-Men.

00:03.125 --> 00:04.500
Who are you?

00:04.500 --> 00:07.708
My name is Arkon,
ruler of Polemachus.

00:08.291 --> 00:10.250
My planet is dying.

00:10.250 --> 00:13.958
You, mistress of the elements,
can save us.

00:13.958 --> 00:16.583
When you cast your eyes
on my troubled world,

00:16.583 --> 00:18.458
you will begin to understand.

00:18.458 --> 00:20.708
These storms have weakened
the Ring of Verdon,

00:20.708 --> 00:24.375
which protects our planet
the way the ozone layer
protects your Earth.

00:24.375 --> 00:29.083
I sense a terrible wound.
What is that device?

00:29.083 --> 00:31.208
It is the central energy
transmitter.

00:31.208 --> 00:35.375
Polemachus depends on it
for a great deal,
including our security.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.625
But, Arkon, it is causing...

00:37.625 --> 00:40.583
Surely your powers
are strong enough
to accommodate its presence.

00:40.583 --> 00:45.708
[Arkon] It's over, my darling.
We are saved!

00:45.708 --> 00:49.708
Storm, will you rule
by my side, as empress?

00:50.833 --> 00:52.708
Yes, I will!

00:52.708 --> 00:58.000
I present to you,
our queen, Storm!

00:58.416 --> 00:59.875
Oh, my!

01:03.291 --> 01:05.833
[opening theme song playing]

01:32.708 --> 01:36.166
[Arkon] People of Polemachus,
in honor of Storm,

01:36.166 --> 01:40.500
as both the savior
of our planets
and as my betrothed,

01:40.500 --> 01:45.708
I hereby proclaim
the observance
of the Festival of Storm!

01:45.708 --> 01:47.875
Every year this honor
shall be bestowed,

01:47.875 --> 01:50.291
to show our new queen

01:50.291 --> 01:54.708
how citizens of Polemachus
demonstrate
their love and gratitude!

01:55.125 --> 02:00.625
Polemachus will again
be a kingdom
of riches and contentment!

02:00.625 --> 02:02.416
Rebuilding our world
is a hard task.

02:02.416 --> 02:04.291
[man yelling]

02:04.291 --> 02:08.125
We must not close our hearts
to the joys of life!

02:08.125 --> 02:11.000
Let the celebrations begin!

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Something ain't right
about this dump.
I can smell it.

02:15.416 --> 02:17.416
I don't want
to lose her either, Logan.

02:17.416 --> 02:20.500
But if this is what Storm
wants, who are we
to stand in her way?

02:20.500 --> 02:24.583
-We're her friends, that's who.
-[Beast] Wolverine is correct.

02:24.583 --> 02:28.958
Storm's acceptance
of this marriage proposal
seems unnaturally sudden.

02:28.958 --> 02:32.708
And she's planning to stay
with him
on this mud ball forever.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.750
Storm's not acting
like herself!

02:34.750 --> 02:39.416
Perhaps that is because,
for the first time in my life,

02:39.416 --> 02:43.875
I am truly happy.
I understand your concern.

02:43.875 --> 02:48.875
Cyclops, as our leader,
you worry for my safety,

02:48.875 --> 02:53.291
yet you are generous enough
to want for me
only what is good.

02:53.291 --> 02:58.583
Hank, you have analyzed
my decision and found
my logic wanting.

02:58.583 --> 03:04.166
My dear friend, my decision
comes not from my mind,

03:04.166 --> 03:05.958
but from my heart.

03:05.958 --> 03:09.875
And Logan, you more than anyone
know the pain that comes

03:09.875 --> 03:12.208
when one is not at peace.

03:12.208 --> 03:16.250
I have been dedicated
to the X-Men
since I was a teenager,

03:16.250 --> 03:19.583
never allowing myself a life
beyond my work.

03:19.583 --> 03:22.875
For years
I have fought our lonely fight

03:22.875 --> 03:27.708
and yet, our world
is still no home for mutants.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.708
It's the only home we got.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.375
Not for me.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.125
I have a chance
to make a difference here!

03:34.125 --> 03:39.750
To heal a wounded planet
and to be happy
with a man that I love.

03:39.750 --> 03:43.208
-A great man!
-Who you just met.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.125
Please. You are my family.

03:47.125 --> 03:51.125
Why can you not help me
through this and share my joy?

03:51.125 --> 03:52.875
Of course we will.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.458
[Jubilee] I wouldn't miss
this wedding for the world!

03:55.458 --> 03:58.208
Hey! Get one of those
golf balls from Arkon,

03:58.208 --> 04:00.708
and we'll get
the Professor here
to give you away!

04:01.875 --> 04:04.750
Thank you all so much.

04:04.750 --> 04:09.500
You will see,
Arkon is a truly wonderful man!

04:22.625 --> 04:26.708
The fleet is ready,
Your Majesty. They await
only the order to strike.

04:26.708 --> 04:31.583
Excellent! The great
eco-instability
is now under control.

04:31.583 --> 04:35.000
But it has cost Polemachus
dearly in production
and wealth!

04:35.458 --> 04:38.458
Your Majesty,
the Science Council
has determined

04:38.458 --> 04:41.458
that the great chaos was due
to the central power grid.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.083
It could have been solved

04:43.083 --> 04:45.875
by simply turning off
the main transmitter.

04:45.875 --> 04:49.166
And then what, you fool?

04:49.166 --> 04:51.958
It would be like before,
no power for the guards,

04:51.958 --> 04:54.166
no obedience rings
to control the workers!

04:54.166 --> 04:55.958
Chaos, rebellion!

04:55.958 --> 04:58.958
I agree! Turning off the grid
is out of the question.

04:58.958 --> 05:01.458
There are more laborers
than Polemachuns in the city!

05:01.458 --> 05:03.625
Our world is in ruin.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.583
We desperately need help
to rebuild it.

05:06.583 --> 05:11.416
And we will get that help from
our nearest neighbor, Belgania!

05:11.416 --> 05:15.291
It is my duty to remind,
Your Majesty, of our
peace treaty with Belgania.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.458
Our people need workers!

05:17.458 --> 05:22.000
Without them, we return
to the barren lives
of our ancestors.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.583
Polemachus' destiny
will not be stopped

05:24.583 --> 05:26.583
by a scrap of paper!

05:28.416 --> 05:32.708
We attack tonight!
Fill the worker ships
until they burst.

05:34.708 --> 05:37.458
Show no mercy!

05:41.458 --> 05:46.000
[Jubilee] Wow! This is totally
awesome! It's real gold!

05:46.000 --> 05:48.125
I could get used
to being a queen!

05:48.500 --> 05:50.083
[laughing]

05:51.375 --> 05:52.708
[woman yells]

05:54.625 --> 05:56.000
[Jubilee] Uh-oh.

05:59.375 --> 06:00.958
[Storm laughing]

06:00.958 --> 06:02.458
[both laughing]

06:02.458 --> 06:05.375
I'm sorry, mistress.
Please do not report me!

06:05.375 --> 06:07.458
It shall not happen again.
Forgive me.

06:07.458 --> 06:13.083
-Hey! It was my fault.
-I beg you. Do not report me.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.583
Storm, that was weird.
She was like...

06:18.583 --> 06:20.625
She was terrified!

06:22.750 --> 06:25.458
A most magnificent homage,
is it not?

06:25.458 --> 06:29.125
Oh, yeah.
Maybe a little too magnificent.

06:29.125 --> 06:32.250
You know about Storm's tribe
worshiping her
when she was a kid.

06:32.250 --> 06:35.583
-[Beast] Yeah.
-All that goddess stuff
messed up her head.

06:35.583 --> 06:38.333
But Xavier worked her
through all that.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.583
Maybe.
But take a good look around.

06:41.583 --> 06:45.125
I ain't so sure this place
is as great for her
as she thinks.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.958
[Wolverine] Hey, pal.
We're buddies
of your new queen.

06:48.958 --> 06:52.000
Know where a guy can get
a burger and fries around here?

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
Please!

06:54.458 --> 06:55.625
[screams]

06:56.333 --> 06:59.500
I am sorry, but I must return
to my work at once!

06:59.500 --> 07:03.000
He seemed very concerned
about that robot guard.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.833
He wasn't concerned, Hank.
He was shaking in his boots.

07:06.833 --> 07:09.000
Get your nose ready, Logan.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
We may have some local slime
to sniff out before
our visit is over.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.708
[Wolverine] They don't look
like they're going out
for pizza.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.250
Hold on, Logan. We don't know
anything about this.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.125
-Those ships could be...
-Family cruise ships.

07:34.125 --> 07:36.208
Come on, Cyke.

07:36.208 --> 07:38.875
You've spent enough time
in space to know war birds
when you see 'em.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.875
We need to check this out.

07:40.875 --> 07:44.458
-Let's follow the tough boys.
-Let's not get in too deep.

07:49.875 --> 07:52.166
[Jubilee] Boy!
They're in one heck of a hurry.

07:52.166 --> 07:53.625
I wonder where they're going?

07:53.625 --> 07:55.250
[Arkon] They are traveling
to Belgania,

07:55.250 --> 07:57.375
our nearest neighbor in space.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.208
They will bring back
supplies, workers,

07:59.208 --> 08:01.625
and the dignitaries
for tonight's royal dinner.

08:01.625 --> 08:04.208
Most important of all, my love,

08:04.208 --> 08:07.875
they will bring back
wedding treasures
to tempt and delight you.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.625
Arkon, please.

08:09.625 --> 08:12.458
You should not go
to so much trouble just for me.

08:12.458 --> 08:16.458
In pleasing you,
there is no trouble,
only happiness.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.625
That was an awful lot of ships.

08:18.625 --> 08:21.708
The recent crises
have ravaged Polemachus.

08:21.708 --> 08:26.833
Our farmlands, factories,
villages, and our people
have suffered terribly.

08:26.833 --> 08:29.708
Those ships will bring help
in restoring them.

08:29.708 --> 08:31.708
The task is enormous.

08:32.458 --> 08:34.958
And we shall face it together.

08:34.958 --> 08:38.958
What is this? How dare you
not kneel in my presence!

08:40.833 --> 08:42.458
[beeping]

08:42.458 --> 08:46.875
Arkon, you are hurting her!
Stop this, please!

08:46.875 --> 08:48.875
As you wish, beloved.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.625
[gasps]

08:50.625 --> 08:54.333
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
It will not happen again.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.958
[Arkon] You may go.

08:58.250 --> 09:01.500
The poor girl was terrified
at the sight of you.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.083
Fear is so thick around here,
you could Rollerblade on it.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.625
Please, you are new
to Polemachus.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.458
Our enemies
are clever and ruthless.

09:09.458 --> 09:12.000
Friends have been lost through
a moment's carelessness.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.583
I must be firm.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.083
Caution is possible
without cruelty!

09:16.083 --> 09:18.125
Do not judge me harshly

09:18.125 --> 09:21.458
until you know more
of the difficult ways
of our world.

09:21.458 --> 09:25.166
I cannot live this way, Arkon!
We must discuss this!

09:25.166 --> 09:27.166
Of course, Storm.

09:27.166 --> 09:31.000
Your love means more to me
than the beating
of my own heart.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.958
Won't you give me
your trust as well?

09:36.416 --> 09:39.166
You shall not regret it,
I promise you.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.958
[man grunts] No!

10:22.958 --> 10:24.250
[speaking indistinctly]

10:30.125 --> 10:33.583
You gonna try and tell me
these guys are volunteers?

10:33.583 --> 10:35.750
You've made your point, Logan.

10:35.750 --> 10:39.375
I'm gonna turn those
iron bully-boys
into scrap metal!

10:39.375 --> 10:43.166
I wouldn't advise that,
my eager friend! All of you,
come with me, now!

10:43.166 --> 10:47.583
Buddy, you just pointed that
pop gun at the wrong man!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.625
-Wolverine, wait!
-An excellent idea.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.750
He just took out
one of those robot guards!

10:56.750 --> 10:59.208
There are more coming!
You've triggered the alarms.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.750
[Mentor] We must leave, now!

11:00.750 --> 11:02.375
Looks like he's got a point.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.166
I guess this means
we're not invited
to the bachelor party.

11:28.208 --> 11:31.750
You fight well.
You must do this often.

11:31.750 --> 11:35.583
I am Mentor, leader
of the Belganian resistance.

11:35.583 --> 11:38.500
Perhaps you will help me
to free my people.

11:41.708 --> 11:45.833
Beast! Wolverine! Get those
prisoners out of there!

11:45.833 --> 11:46.875
[Wolverine yelling]

11:48.291 --> 11:50.000
Now you're talking!

12:05.000 --> 12:07.416
Everyone, into the hills, now!

12:17.333 --> 12:20.458
The new workers! Section Five!
Code Omega!

12:20.458 --> 12:22.750
Wolverine! Any more guards?

12:22.750 --> 12:26.833
About those guards,
here comes the B team.

12:28.416 --> 12:30.875
OK! We've got
to get out of here!

12:33.833 --> 12:37.750
-We're cut off!
-So?

12:42.375 --> 12:47.333
-I was saving this
for an emergency.
-I believe this qualifies.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.833
Beast!
Hurry, it's beginning to close!

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
[grunts]

13:07.000 --> 13:10.875
-Hank. How bad is it?
-A bit worse
than I might have liked.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.000
[groans]

13:12.000 --> 13:14.333
Summon the healers at once!

13:16.208 --> 13:19.750
You have always lived
on Polemachus.
Which one would you suggest?

13:19.750 --> 13:23.083
Mistress, it is not my place!

13:23.583 --> 13:28.333
If my choice were wrong...
Please do not ask me!

13:28.333 --> 13:32.291
You have nothing to fear,
I have spoken to Arkon.

13:32.291 --> 13:33.750
No! Please!

13:34.958 --> 13:37.875
Storm,
something's really wrong here.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.291
I will change it!
Whatever it is,
I can make it better.

13:43.291 --> 13:47.333
Arkon admits that some
of their ways
may seem harsh to us.

13:47.333 --> 13:53.416
But Polemachus is fighting
to survive. Oh, Jubilee,
I am needed here.

13:53.416 --> 13:59.416
Arkon is a kind and decent man!
I love him!
He asked me for my trust.

13:59.416 --> 14:03.000
-Can't you understand?
-Sure.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.125
[Jubilee] But I'm not the one
you're trying to convince.

14:08.708 --> 14:09.875
[Cyclops]
How are you feeling, Beast?

14:09.875 --> 14:11.958
[Beast] Thankful for life,

14:11.958 --> 14:14.708
yet ambivalent about
the true function
of the pain receptors

14:14.708 --> 14:16.833
of the human nervous system.

14:16.833 --> 14:20.458
Scott, I have grave misgivings
about this wedding.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.500
Arkon is a ruthless tyrant!

14:22.500 --> 14:25.250
Thousands of my people
have been enslaved.

14:25.250 --> 14:29.583
Thousands more have perished
at the hands
of his robot guards.

14:29.583 --> 14:33.166
Maybe I should have
a little talk with the groom.

14:33.166 --> 14:36.625
I wish it were that easy,
Logan. But Storm loves him.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.458
She's got to see
Arkon's tyranny for herself.

14:39.458 --> 14:42.500
We have learned
the access codes
to Arkon's transport ships.

14:42.500 --> 14:46.000
We could use them to escape,
but for this.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.250
That tower feeds energy
to the robots,
and the control rings.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.750
The entire structure
of their police state
depends upon it.

14:52.750 --> 14:56.416
Arkon is building an even more
powerful transmitter,

14:56.416 --> 15:00.125
one that will detect us
even in these caverns.

15:00.125 --> 15:03.125
I'm afraid it's time
to break the news to Storm.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.500
nd break her heart.

15:05.250 --> 15:09.500
The resistance and your guests
rescued most of the slaves

15:09.500 --> 15:10.958
before we could apprehend them.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.875
This is intolerable!

15:12.875 --> 15:15.333
These Earth criminals
must be stopped!

15:15.333 --> 15:18.583
But, Your Majesty,
they're your fiancee's friends!

15:18.583 --> 15:21.750
-What if they resist?
-Eliminate them.

15:21.750 --> 15:26.416
The mood of my fiancee
need not concern you.

15:33.125 --> 15:36.333
Don't worry, Storm.
They'll show up.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.958
You are not eating your dinner,
my dear.

15:39.958 --> 15:43.958
-Does it not please you?
-It must be
all of the excitement.

15:43.958 --> 15:47.083
Ah, but it has only just begun!

15:47.708 --> 15:53.583
My loyal subjects,
by the spirit
of my ancestors, a toast!

15:53.583 --> 15:58.875
To Storm, savior of our planet,
conqueror of my heart.

16:00.958 --> 16:04.125
Storm, will you stand
and acknowledge
the love of our people?

16:04.125 --> 16:05.250
I...

16:05.250 --> 16:06.625
[crashing]

16:10.166 --> 16:13.375
-Hope I didn't miss chow.
-Seize them!

16:13.375 --> 16:16.375
No! Stop this madness!

16:16.375 --> 16:19.708
Cyclops! Logan!
What are you doing?

16:19.708 --> 16:21.708
Ask your boyfriend.

16:21.708 --> 16:24.375
Ask him how he recruits
the palace help.

16:24.375 --> 16:28.416
-It ain't the want ads, baby.
-They are not servants,
are they?

16:28.416 --> 16:30.875
-They are slaves!
-What of it?

16:30.875 --> 16:34.000
When Belgania was
the stronger planet,
they raided us.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.458
Now it is our turn!
What is wrong with that?

16:37.458 --> 16:39.583
It is the way
of all great people!

16:39.583 --> 16:42.833
It is not the way
of a just people!

16:42.833 --> 16:46.250
How could you
lie to me, you butcher!

16:46.833 --> 16:49.583
How could you make me love you?

16:49.583 --> 16:52.708
I did not give you
permission to leave!

16:53.416 --> 16:56.833
She doesn't need
anyone's permission.
Let her go!

16:56.833 --> 16:59.000
Enough of this childishness!

17:02.333 --> 17:04.958
Throw them in the slave pits!

17:07.583 --> 17:09.208
[all shouting]

17:15.458 --> 17:18.000
[Arkon] I shall dispose
of you myself!

17:33.875 --> 17:36.000
You like scaring people, pal?

17:36.458 --> 17:39.333
Why don't you let me show you
how it feels?

17:39.333 --> 17:40.416
[screams]

17:44.000 --> 17:45.125
[Beast grunts]

17:52.458 --> 17:57.375
-It's Storm!
-[Arkon] The rings!

17:57.375 --> 18:01.000
If she damages them further,
she'll undo all she healed!

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Polemachus will be devastated!

18:03.000 --> 18:05.833
Storm, stop! Please!

18:12.625 --> 18:17.000
Storm, listen to me!
What you're doing is wrong!

18:21.291 --> 18:25.458
If you want this dirt pile
to still be here
in the morning, friend,

18:25.458 --> 18:28.458
I'd get us some of those
glowing golf balls right now!

18:29.000 --> 18:31.583
You'll hurt innocent people!

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Arkon's making you act against
everything you believe in!

18:42.000 --> 18:45.083
Please, Storm,
he's not worth it!

18:47.166 --> 18:50.458
You are right. Forgive me.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.583
Come on, let's get out of here.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.583
[Arkon] Storm! Please!

19:07.583 --> 19:12.250
Storm, I can get anything,
riches beyond your imagining,

19:12.250 --> 19:14.375
our world will worship you!

19:14.875 --> 19:17.000
We are going home.

19:17.458 --> 19:20.750
You will be nothing on Earth,
cast out and despised,

19:20.750 --> 19:23.166
feared and reviled
for your gifts!

19:23.166 --> 19:24.958
What of the slaves, Arkon?

19:24.958 --> 19:28.708
The slaves?
What are they to our happiness?

19:28.708 --> 19:30.958
Everything, Arkon.

19:30.958 --> 19:36.333
I am offering you a world!
Don't be a fool!
The slaves are nothing.

19:36.333 --> 19:40.000
No living being has the right
to enslave another.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.583
One day you may understand.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.208
[shouting]

19:51.208 --> 19:57.208
-What have you done?
-A royal wedding gift,
from the heart.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.125
To the ships! To the ships!

20:01.750 --> 20:05.000
[Arkon] Storm!

20:11.333 --> 20:15.000
[Jubilee] Wolverine,
she seems so sad.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.166
I got to go talk to her.

20:17.166 --> 20:20.000
Give it a while, kid.
Storm knows you care.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.833
You helped her back there
when it counted.

20:22.833 --> 20:23.708
The rest...

20:24.583 --> 20:27.500
well, she's gonna have
to work through for herself.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.583
[closing music playing]
