01:47.587 --> 01:49.851
Idiots.

01:53.593 --> 01:57.689
Take the captain beyond the reef
till we get permission
to bring him ashore.

02:00.133 --> 02:02.624
For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

02:02.702 --> 02:07.105
Fernand Mondego does not
abandon his friends in the face
of stupid, suicidal danger.

02:07.174 --> 02:11.907
However, as Monsieur Morell's
official representative
on this voyage, Edmond,

02:11.978 --> 02:15.038
I must officially tell you
you have overstepped
your bounds as second mate.

02:15.115 --> 02:17.777
Officially. There.
I've covered myself.

02:17.851 --> 02:20.479
If we don't get him to
a doctor, he will die.
Do you understand?

02:20.554 --> 02:23.489
Of course I understand.
Just don't expect me
to do this sober.

02:23.557 --> 02:25.491
- [Horse Whinnies]
- Right.

02:25.559 --> 02:28.824
[Fernand]
English dragoons.

02:28.895 --> 02:30.658
Hello!

02:32.532 --> 02:35.000
Dantes, don't.

02:36.036 --> 02:37.867
[Whinnying]

02:37.938 --> 02:39.997
- A little careless,
don't you think?
- We have to talk to someone.

02:40.073 --> 02:42.633
Well, I know, but...

02:42.709 --> 02:44.074
We're French sailors!

02:44.144 --> 02:46.612
- We seek medical attention!
- Come on. Come on.

02:47.481 --> 02:50.245
- We come in peace.
- Come on.

02:50.917 --> 02:52.544
We mean no harm!

02:52.619 --> 02:54.553
Edmond!

02:59.559 --> 03:02.392
Come on! Climb!

03:12.506 --> 03:14.531
Look out!

03:38.098 --> 03:39.725
Fernand!

03:44.804 --> 03:48.240
Good. You finally
hit something.

03:53.346 --> 03:55.871
Lieutenant Graypool.

03:55.949 --> 03:58.577
If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools,

03:58.652 --> 04:00.813
then by all means
shoot them.

04:00.887 --> 04:03.879
But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

04:03.957 --> 04:06.118
Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

04:06.192 --> 04:09.855
Sir, I am Edmond Dantes,

04:09.930 --> 04:13.627
second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

04:13.700 --> 04:18.762
This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego,

04:18.838 --> 04:21.500
son of the Count Mondego.

04:21.575 --> 04:25.136
Our captain has
contracted brain fever,
so we put in here for help.

04:28.281 --> 04:32.980
If his coma is genuine,
he won't feel my knife point,
will he?

04:35.522 --> 04:38.320
Only a scratch.

04:43.330 --> 04:45.264
[Flesh Cutting]

04:46.700 --> 04:48.258
Edmond!

04:48.335 --> 04:50.826
- Lieutenant Graypool!
- We came to you in good faith!

04:50.904 --> 04:55.466
- That's for my wounded men.
- And wounded pride, no doubt.

05:03.617 --> 05:07.212
It has been an eventful evening.

05:16.529 --> 05:21.296
If I hadn't have shot those
dragoons, you might by lying in
pieces on the beach right now.

05:21.368 --> 05:25.702
- I almost got us killed.
- Yes, you did.

05:25.772 --> 05:29.071
Yet... we survive.

05:29.142 --> 05:32.339
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

05:32.412 --> 05:34.346
- Whoo-hoo!
- [Laughs]

05:34.414 --> 05:38.851
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

05:38.918 --> 05:41.148
King's to you, Mondego.

05:41.221 --> 05:44.816
Being your friend
is always an adventure. [Laughs]

05:44.891 --> 05:48.327
- Yes, it is, isn't it?
- [Laughs]

05:48.395 --> 05:50.659
It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

05:50.730 --> 05:52.254
What?

05:52.332 --> 05:55.597
Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

05:55.669 --> 05:59.935
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Drink up.

06:00.006 --> 06:03.908
We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

06:03.977 --> 06:06.844
[Napoleon] I think you'll find
the 1806 the finer vintage.

06:06.913 --> 06:10.815
As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes, I wonder...

06:10.884 --> 06:13.250
if I might have
a word with you.

06:15.555 --> 06:19.889
I'm curious. What's the significance
of the chess piece?

06:20.093 --> 06:24.029
It's just something
we've done since childhood.

06:24.097 --> 06:28.397
Whenever one of us has had a victory,
king of the moment.

06:28.468 --> 06:30.698
- King of the moment?
- Yes.

06:30.770 --> 06:35.673
[Chuckles] In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

06:35.742 --> 06:40.111
I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

06:40.180 --> 06:43.616
He is my captain...
and my friend, Your Majesty.

06:43.683 --> 06:46.049
Loyal friends
are rare indeed.

06:46.119 --> 06:49.714
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

06:49.789 --> 06:53.953
I have written a rather
sentimental letter to an
old comrade in Marseilles.

06:54.027 --> 06:56.621
It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

06:56.696 --> 06:59.688
Since they have a habit
of opening my mail,

06:59.766 --> 07:03.600
I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.831
Oh, l-I don't...

07:05.905 --> 07:08.840
It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

07:08.908 --> 07:11.775
It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

07:11.845 --> 07:15.303
But more important,
it is the price I demand
for the use of my physician.

07:19.252 --> 07:21.243
Then I agree.

07:21.321 --> 07:23.255
Good.

07:23.323 --> 07:26.520
You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

07:26.593 --> 07:30.859
- Can you remember that name?
- Monsieur Clarion.
How will I find him?

07:30.930 --> 07:33.865
Oh, he will find you.

07:33.933 --> 07:37.699
Now, I do not wish
this letter's existence
to be known to anyone else.

07:37.771 --> 07:41.070
Not even your boon companion back there.
Do you understand?

07:41.141 --> 07:43.473
I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

07:43.543 --> 07:47.274
Yes, I, uh...
I believe you are.

08:02.729 --> 08:04.663
What did he want?

08:04.731 --> 08:09.794
Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

08:29.355 --> 08:33.347
Time you were on your way.
Your captain has been dead
for half an hour.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.364
Are you sure?

08:39.432 --> 08:43.061
When you have walked
as many battlefields as I,
young Dantes,

08:43.135 --> 08:45.070
you can feel death.

08:50.844 --> 08:53.278
Kings and pawns, Marchand.

08:53.346 --> 08:57.783
Emperors... and fools.

09:05.296 --> 09:08.231
[Chattering]

09:08.299 --> 09:11.564
[Man]
Come about!

09:18.142 --> 09:20.110
Drive faster.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.787
[Bell Chiming]

09:35.326 --> 09:37.590
Danglars, what's happened?

09:37.662 --> 09:41.063
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,

09:41.132 --> 09:43.532
and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

09:43.601 --> 09:47.435
Come to my office
and report, Danglars.

09:47.605 --> 09:51.371
- And you, Edmond.
- Will you be needing me,
Monsieur Morell?

09:51.442 --> 09:52.602
Go.

09:57.281 --> 09:59.442
Mercedes.

09:59.517 --> 10:04.454
- Where is he? Where is Edmond?
- How lovely to see you too.

10:04.522 --> 10:06.717
You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

10:06.791 --> 10:09.385
Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

10:09.460 --> 10:11.485
He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

10:11.562 --> 10:13.587
I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

10:13.664 --> 10:15.928
Is this true?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.400
I accept
all responsibility.

10:18.469 --> 10:21.927
As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

10:22.006 --> 10:25.772
It should have
been your idea.

10:25.843 --> 10:29.279
Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

10:29.347 --> 10:32.510
- I was protectin'the merchandise.
- You were protecting yourself...

10:32.583 --> 10:36.383
by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

10:36.454 --> 10:41.983
Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

10:44.929 --> 10:48.194
You presume to demote me?

10:48.266 --> 10:50.200
There is no demotion.

10:50.268 --> 10:54.364
You will remain first mate
under Captain Dantes.

10:54.438 --> 10:57.805
Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

11:08.386 --> 11:11.480
Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

11:11.555 --> 11:14.854
who will want
to hear this news.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.329
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.674
Monsieur Morell?

11:31.742 --> 11:37.180
- I understand you had a ship just
returned from Elba, monsieur.
- Yes.

11:37.248 --> 11:41.981
Did anyone aboard
get ashore there by any chance?

11:42.053 --> 11:45.648
They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

11:46.724 --> 11:48.817
Thank you, monsieur.

11:48.893 --> 11:51.555
- May I say who has called upon them?
- Clarion.

11:51.629 --> 11:54.393
The name is Clarion.

12:00.304 --> 12:03.933
- Make love to me.
- Will you ever give up?

12:04.008 --> 12:06.499
- He doesn't have to know.
- I'd know.

12:06.577 --> 12:08.977
So would I.

12:09.046 --> 12:12.846
- It'd be our little secret.
- I don't believe in secrets.

12:12.917 --> 12:17.752
You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

12:17.822 --> 12:21.087
- I know what you want, Fernand.
- You do?

12:21.158 --> 12:25.891
Remember when we were kids and
Edmond got that whistle for his
birthday, and you got a pony?

12:25.963 --> 12:29.763
You were so mad Edmond
was happier with his whistle
than you were with your pony.

12:29.834 --> 12:33.600
I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

12:36.474 --> 12:39.466
How long do you think
it's going to be before
he can afford a wife?

12:39.543 --> 12:43.604
Two years.
Two years. That's all.

12:43.681 --> 12:46.673
Then he gets his captain's
papers, and we can marry.

12:46.751 --> 12:50.744
Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything,

12:50.821 --> 12:53.051
particularly
a bride like you.

12:54.725 --> 12:56.215
Hey!

12:56.293 --> 12:58.454
- [Mercedes] There he is.
- Hey!

12:58.529 --> 13:00.724
- [Laughs] Whoo!
- Mercedes!

13:06.637 --> 13:09.970
[Mercedes]
I missed you so.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.406
The missing is over now.

13:12.476 --> 13:16.435
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm captain. Come on.

13:20.551 --> 13:23.748
Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

13:23.821 --> 13:26.415
Edmond!

13:26.490 --> 13:28.583
King's to me.

13:28.659 --> 13:33.687
[Chuckles] Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.496
[Clicks Tongue]

13:39.103 --> 13:40.365
Come on.

13:40.438 --> 13:43.601
- You're still the best man.
- I know.

13:43.674 --> 13:45.767
Come on!

14:14.205 --> 14:17.538
Stop that.
You'll go bald.

14:23.647 --> 14:25.740
Do you keep secrets from me?

14:25.816 --> 14:29.809
Secrets? No.

14:29.887 --> 14:31.821
Why?

14:36.360 --> 14:38.555
Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.833
We don't have to wait
two years anymore.

14:45.903 --> 14:51.432
- As soon as I can afford
the ring, we'll wed...
- I don't need a ring. I don't.

14:59.116 --> 15:01.050
This will be my ring.

15:01.118 --> 15:05.145
And no matter what happens,

15:05.222 --> 15:09.556
you will never see it
off my finger.

15:09.627 --> 15:11.595
Ever.

15:21.772 --> 15:25.868
[Danglars]
Hello, my fine young gentleman.

15:25.943 --> 15:27.968
Care to join me?

15:33.050 --> 15:35.712
So tell me, Mondego,

15:37.922 --> 15:41.153
how did you ever
become friends...

15:41.225 --> 15:44.422
with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

15:46.630 --> 15:49.394
He claims to be my friend,

15:51.135 --> 15:54.127
yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.570
What secrets?

16:09.720 --> 16:12.780
[Tapping]

16:12.856 --> 16:17.350
To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

16:18.629 --> 16:22.588
All I am I owe
to you, Father.

16:23.901 --> 16:27.837
May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

16:27.905 --> 16:32.774
of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

16:32.843 --> 16:34.777
[Door Opens]

16:34.845 --> 16:39.441
- Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
- I am.

16:39.516 --> 16:42.679
Edmond Dantes,
you are under arrest by order
of the magistrate of Marseilles.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.983
- Arrest?
- On what charges?

16:45.055 --> 16:47.819
That information is
privileged. Take him.

16:47.891 --> 16:52.385
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

16:52.463 --> 16:56.559
I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

16:56.634 --> 16:58.864
Mon Dieu.

17:11.382 --> 17:14.078
Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

17:15.352 --> 17:17.479
Traitor?

17:17.554 --> 17:21.080
Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

17:21.157 --> 17:24.685
Did you have any personal
contact with Napoleon
when you were on Elba?

17:24.762 --> 17:26.992
Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

17:27.064 --> 17:31.831
I was with the
Count Mondego's son, Fernand,
almost the entire time.

17:31.902 --> 17:35.235
- Do you know Fernand?
- He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

17:35.305 --> 17:39.401
Oh, there you are.
He'll vouch for me.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.036
No doubt, but you said,
"almost the entire time."

17:44.848 --> 17:50.252
Except for when Napoleon asked
me to deliver a personal letter
to a friend in Marseilles.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.347
Well, Dantes, it is for
accepting that treasonous
correspondence...

17:54.425 --> 17:58.259
that you have been denounced
by your own first mate,
a Monsieur Danglars.

17:58.328 --> 18:01.092
- What?
- Did you deliver the letter?

18:01.165 --> 18:03.861
No, sir, someone was
supposed to find me.

18:03.934 --> 18:07.062
It's... It's still
in my jacket. Here.

18:26.190 --> 18:30.490
- Have you read this?
- No, sir, I can't read.

18:30.561 --> 18:35.464
Well, Dantes,
this is a letter to one
of Napoleon's agents.

18:35.532 --> 18:40.299
It gives the times and
the locations of the British
beach patrols on Elba.

18:40.370 --> 18:44.067
Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

18:44.141 --> 18:46.109
He swore its contents
were innocent.

18:53.217 --> 18:58.280
No, it's you
that's innocent.

18:58.355 --> 19:00.949
Foolish and innocent.

19:01.024 --> 19:04.653
I believe these are
the worst charges that could
be leveled against you.

19:04.728 --> 19:10.325
Fortunately, as I've
intercepted this document,
there's no harm done.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.767
God knows how
you're going to survive in
this world, Edmond Dantes.

19:13.837 --> 19:16.772
But you are no traitor.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.434
You may go.

19:21.879 --> 19:23.904
Thank you, sir.

19:26.183 --> 19:31.644
Wait, uh, did Napoleon
tell you who's supposed
to pick up the letter?

19:31.722 --> 19:33.883
Monsieur Clarion.

19:33.957 --> 19:35.948
What name did you say?

19:38.128 --> 19:40.062
Monsieur Clarion.

19:41.465 --> 19:43.695
Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

19:43.767 --> 19:45.997
Monsieur Mondego
or anyone?

19:46.069 --> 19:51.268
No, sir, in fact,
Monsieur Mondego knows
nothing of this letter.

19:56.246 --> 20:01.183
This is very
dangerous information.

20:01.251 --> 20:04.220
One can never be too careful
in times like this.

20:04.288 --> 20:07.348
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

20:07.424 --> 20:09.824
Mm-hmm.

20:09.893 --> 20:13.420
I've given you rather
a stressful time.

20:13.497 --> 20:17.297
I wonder if, by way of an
apology, I could offer you
my carriage home.

20:17.367 --> 20:20.165
- [Door Closes]
- It's just through here.

20:24.908 --> 20:27.206
[Hoofbeats, Carriage
Approaching]

20:27.277 --> 20:29.438
Thank you.

20:46.964 --> 20:50.365
Monsieur Villefort?
Monsieur Villefort?

20:50.434 --> 20:52.629
Monsieur Villefort!

21:14.191 --> 21:16.159
Whoa. Whoa!

21:20.063 --> 21:22.827
Where are you taking me?

21:24.001 --> 21:26.299
[Edmond]
This is a mistake.

21:26.370 --> 21:30.136
- I'm allowed to go home.
- From now on, your home is
the prison Chateau d'lf.

21:30.207 --> 21:33.142
- No! No! No!
- [Gasps]

21:33.210 --> 21:35.405
- [Groans]
- Hey!

21:41.919 --> 21:45.548
[Man]
Shoot him now!

21:45.622 --> 21:48.955
Mount up!
Get after him!

22:05.242 --> 22:09.804
Fernand! Fernand!

22:09.880 --> 22:12.872
- Monsieur?
- It's all right.
He's right here. Fernand!

22:12.950 --> 22:16.818
I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

22:16.887 --> 22:19.515
When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.217
I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

22:22.292 --> 22:24.226
He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

22:24.294 --> 22:26.819
But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

22:26.897 --> 22:29.457
It was to one of his agents.

22:29.533 --> 22:32.434
Somehow the authorities found out.
I don't know what to do.

22:32.502 --> 22:34.493
There's gendarmes on
horseback right behind me.

22:34.571 --> 22:37.734
All right.
We just have to think.

22:37.808 --> 22:39.742
I hope I haven't
compromised you.

22:39.810 --> 22:41.835
I was hoping your father
could help me.

22:41.912 --> 22:44.210
He's in Paris.
He's very ill.

22:44.281 --> 22:47.250
- How far back are the gendarmes?
- Minutes.

22:47.317 --> 22:49.877
- Do you need money?
- Yes, thank you.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.513
- Do you have a pistol?
- Of course not.

22:52.589 --> 22:54.648
Good.

22:54.725 --> 22:58.217
Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

23:02.332 --> 23:04.926
I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

23:05.002 --> 23:07.835
It was you?

23:07.904 --> 23:10.600
Well, it wasn't just me.
It was Danglars's idea.

23:10.674 --> 23:13.939
Why didn't you
come to me first?

23:14.011 --> 23:16.673
Why did you keep it a secret from me?
I thought you were my friend.

23:16.747 --> 23:19.875
I told you I gave Napoleon my word.
He lied to me!

23:19.950 --> 23:22.942
I know, Edmond.
I read the letter.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.853
You... You read...

23:34.664 --> 23:36.723
Why are you doing this?

23:36.800 --> 23:41.464
Oh, it's complicated.

23:43.373 --> 23:45.398
Complicated.

23:47.511 --> 23:49.638
Don't be ridiculous.

23:49.713 --> 23:53.149
- Get out of my way.
- I can't let you go, Edmond.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.836
Get away from the window.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.901
Don't make me
take off your hand!

24:18.975 --> 24:20.602

24:40.330 --> 24:42.457
[Shouts]

24:45.936 --> 24:49.929
Why? In God's name, why?

24:50.006 --> 24:53.772
- [Hoofbeats Approaching]
- Because you're the son of a clerk!

24:53.844 --> 24:56.108
And I'm not supposed
to want to be you.

24:56.179 --> 24:58.272
[Door Opens]

25:01.084 --> 25:03.211
- In here!
- In here!

25:08.792 --> 25:10.885
- [Man] Get!
- Wait.

25:10.961 --> 25:14.522
- [Sword Clatters On Floor]
- [Man] Hold it. Hold it.

25:18.602 --> 25:21.002
To remember better days.

25:23.373 --> 25:25.307
Come on!

25:27.711 --> 25:30.509
I told you it wasn't always
going to be this way, Edmond.

25:42.292 --> 25:46.228
Father! Where is he?

25:46.296 --> 25:49.265
The study.
What's he done now?

25:49.332 --> 25:53.598
Now, you listen to me, Father.
I am the chief magistrate,
an official of the new regime.

25:53.670 --> 25:58.505
I cannot afford to have
my own father mixed up
in treasonous affairs!

25:59.609 --> 26:02.578
You know...
[Chuckles]

26:02.646 --> 26:07.345
In the end, treason
is a matter of dates.

26:07.417 --> 26:12.377
I shall be the patriot,
and you the traitor,
when the emperor returns.

26:12.455 --> 26:14.753
Stop it. Stop it,
you old ruin.

26:14.824 --> 26:19.693
Those days are over.
Napoleon Bonaparte is no longer
the emperor of anything.

26:19.763 --> 26:22.857
If you continue
to dabble in this lunacy,
you run an excellent chance...

26:22.933 --> 26:26.369
of being arrested and ruining
our entire family all because
of your idiotic sympathies.

26:26.436 --> 26:28.165
At least I have sympathies.

26:28.238 --> 26:31.435
For God's sake, Father,
all Valentina is saying...

26:31.508 --> 26:34.102
is that as a family
our fates are intertwined.

26:34.177 --> 26:38.113
- Surely you can see that.
- See? Ah!

26:38.181 --> 26:41.082
I'm an old ruin.

26:41.151 --> 26:45.281
I don't see as well as I did.
You will excuse me.

27:27.264 --> 27:30.631
[Men Groaning]

27:32.068 --> 27:34.764
- Move it.
- [Whistling]

27:43.747 --> 27:45.681
Move.

27:47.550 --> 27:51.486
[Man Screaming]

27:53.390 --> 27:55.756
Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

27:55.825 --> 27:59.192
I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'lf.

27:59.262 --> 28:04.359
Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal,

28:04.434 --> 28:08.962
- but I assure you I am innocent.
- [Scoffs]

28:09.039 --> 28:11.667
Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

28:11.741 --> 28:14.471
- Innocent.
- Yes.

28:14.544 --> 28:17.513
I know. I really do know.

28:18.748 --> 28:23.014
- You mock me?
- No, my dear Dantes.

28:23.086 --> 28:28.353
I know perfectly well
that you are innocent.
Why else would you be here?

28:28.425 --> 28:31.952
- [Liquid Pouring]
- If you were truly guilty,

28:32.028 --> 28:36.556
there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away,

28:36.633 --> 28:42.037
but Chateau d'lf is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

28:45.542 --> 28:48.511
Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

29:04.627 --> 29:08.961
"God will give me justice."

29:09.032 --> 29:12.490
People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

29:12.569 --> 29:17.700
Or they keep calendars,
but soon they lose interest
or they die.

29:17.774 --> 29:21.801
- There's a window.
- All I'm left with is a rather
unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

29:21.878 --> 29:26.372
So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

29:26.449 --> 29:29.418
Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment,

29:29.486 --> 29:31.579
we hurt them.

29:31.654 --> 29:34.316
Usually just
a simple beating really.

29:34.391 --> 29:39.294
Although, on their first day here,
in your case, today,

29:39.362 --> 29:41.762
I like to do
something rather special.

29:41.831 --> 29:44.493
[Gasping]

29:45.869 --> 29:48.133
And if you're
thinking just now,

29:48.204 --> 29:50.934
"Why me, O God?"

29:51.007 --> 29:55.876
- The answer is,
God has nothing to do with it.
- All right?

29:55.945 --> 29:59.278
In fact, God is never
in France this time of year.

29:59.349 --> 30:04.616
God has everything to do with it.
He's everywhere. He sees everything.

30:06.322 --> 30:08.256
All right.

30:09.926 --> 30:12.394
Let's make a bargain,
shall we?

30:12.462 --> 30:18.162
You ask God for help,
and I'll stop the moment he shows up.

30:21.204 --> 30:23.536
[Screams]

30:23.606 --> 30:27.940
- [Whip Continues]
- [Screaming Continues]

30:35.285 --> 30:37.378
Monsieur Villefort,
have you not heard?

30:37.454 --> 30:39.581
- Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
- What?

30:39.656 --> 30:43.422
Landed 100 miles from here.
He marches on Paris!

30:45.929 --> 30:50.832
Pack all my files.
And tell that idiot clerk
to find the ledger!

30:50.900 --> 30:55.166
We are here to plead the case
of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.

30:55.238 --> 30:56.899
Not now! Dantes?

30:56.973 --> 31:02.411
We have not met, monsieur.
I am Fernand Mondego,
the son of Count Mondego.

31:02.479 --> 31:05.607
I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

31:05.682 --> 31:10.881
This is his employer,
Monsieur Morell, his father,
and his fiancee, Mercedes.

31:14.491 --> 31:17.688
Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.228
- Yet you stand by him?
- Of course I do.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.232
What if I was to tell you
that Dantes is also
charged with murder?

31:28.304 --> 31:32.138
- Murder?
- Edmond would never do such a thing.

31:32.208 --> 31:35.109
Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents.

31:35.178 --> 31:37.112
When we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

31:37.180 --> 31:39.944
No, if you knew him,
monsieur, you would know
that was not possible.

31:40.016 --> 31:41.950
Have mercy, please.

31:42.018 --> 31:44.543
You have proof
of this treason?

31:44.621 --> 31:46.555
That is government business.

31:46.623 --> 31:50.559
Please. Please,
just tell us where he is.

31:50.627 --> 31:53.858
I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

31:53.930 --> 31:57.127
I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

31:57.200 --> 32:02.297
But my advice to all of you
would be to forget Edmond Dantes,

32:02.372 --> 32:04.363
particularly you,
mademoiselle.

32:04.440 --> 32:08.137
Take solace in the comfort
of your good friend here...

32:08.211 --> 32:13.239
and perhaps some good may yet come
of this unhappy affair.

32:13.316 --> 32:16.251
Now, you will excuse me.
I have to attend some other matters.

32:16.319 --> 32:17.650
My son is no traitor!

32:17.720 --> 32:19.881
[Fernand]
I will try to reason with him.

32:19.956 --> 32:23.289
- Let's leave this to Fernand.
He can plead the case.
- It's impossible. Never.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.850
I will not give up
on Edmond yet.

32:25.929 --> 32:28.659
I will never
forget your kindness.

32:28.731 --> 32:32.292
And I shall never
cease to give it.

32:37.640 --> 32:42.168
Not that I don't appreciate
the embroidery of the crimes,

32:42.245 --> 32:44.179
but still, murder?

32:44.247 --> 32:47.148
It's quite simple really.

32:47.216 --> 32:49.411
When you reported Dantes's
receiving the letter to me,

32:49.485 --> 32:51.851
I didn't quite understand
why you were betraying him,

32:51.921 --> 32:56.017
but now having seen
his exquisite fiancee,
I understand completely.

32:57.460 --> 32:59.621
What prompts you to be
so accommodating?

33:01.931 --> 33:03.865
Sit down, Mondego.

33:11.774 --> 33:15.608
[Grunts]
Come back!

33:15.678 --> 33:17.669
Come back!

33:17.747 --> 33:22.184
What's my crime?
What's my crime?

33:22.251 --> 33:24.879
I'm innocent!

37:45.715 --> 37:49.515
But I was under
the impression that l...

37:49.585 --> 37:53.487
I was digging
toward the outer wall.

37:56.826 --> 37:59.659
Parlez-vous anglais?

have been spent...

digging this tunnel.

38:15.544 --> 38:19.776
[Laughs]

38:19.849 --> 38:24.786
There are 72,519 stones...

38:24.854 --> 38:27.345
in my walls.

38:28.424 --> 38:30.654
I've counted them many times.

38:33.029 --> 38:35.156
But have you
named them yet?

38:36.632 --> 38:39.795
- [Sobbing]
- Shh, shh.

38:39.869 --> 38:43.168
Shh, shh.

38:43.239 --> 38:45.298
Once I was as you are now.

38:45.374 --> 38:48.866
But I promise, it will pass.

38:50.246 --> 38:52.612
I promise, I promise.

38:52.682 --> 38:56.209
Now, may I stand
on your shoulders?

has faded from my heart.

- Revenge.

of keeping you alive...

39:55.211 --> 39:57.543
these seven years.

39:57.613 --> 40:00.810
- To what end?
- [Chuckles] Escape.

40:12.828 --> 40:15.194
There we go.

40:31.113 --> 40:32.580
[Chuckles]

40:44.026 --> 40:46.824
You spoke of escape.

40:48.230 --> 40:50.198
Yeah.

40:50.266 --> 40:53.531
There are only two possibilities
of reaching the outer wall...

40:53.602 --> 40:55.866
and finally the sea.

40:55.938 --> 41:00.307
I simply...
I simply chose the wrong one.

41:00.376 --> 41:03.345
Now, of course,
with two of us,

41:03.412 --> 41:06.074
we could dig in
the opposite direction.

41:06.148 --> 41:11.643
With both of us together, then,
of course, we could possibly
do it in, oh, eight years.

41:14.523 --> 41:17.048
[Laughs]

41:17.126 --> 41:19.856
Oh, does something else
demand your time?

41:19.929 --> 41:23.262
Some pressing appointment,
perhaps?

41:25.434 --> 41:28.665
In return... for your help,

41:28.737 --> 41:31.001
I offer something priceless.

41:31.073 --> 41:32.768
My freedom?

41:32.842 --> 41:35.538
No, freedom
can be taken away,

41:35.611 --> 41:38.273
as you well know.

41:38.347 --> 41:42.716
I offer knowledge,
everything I have learned.

41:42.785 --> 41:46.277
I will teach you, oh,
economics, mathematics,

41:46.355 --> 41:49.518
- philosophy, science.
- To read and write?

41:51.360 --> 41:53.294
Of course.

41:58.167 --> 42:00.135
When do we start?

42:00.202 --> 42:02.329
I got it. I got it.

[Footsteps Approaching]

Let's have 'em. Come on.

42:11.046 --> 42:13.139
[Abbe's Voice]
The slot opens twice a day.

42:13.215 --> 42:18.847
Once for your toilet bucket,
which is where we hide the dirt.

42:19.922 --> 42:21.856
[Man]
Come on.

42:23.325 --> 42:26.761
And once in the evening
for your plate.

42:28.430 --> 42:30.990
[Man]
Lights out. Out.

42:31.066 --> 42:34.126
Come on, priest.

42:34.203 --> 42:36.330
Thank you.

42:36.405 --> 42:39.636
Between those times we can work all day
without fear of discovery.

42:39.708 --> 42:43.166
"So neglect becomes...

42:43.245 --> 42:45.713
our ally."

42:45.781 --> 42:47.715
Excellent.

42:51.387 --> 42:54.447
So you were in
Napoleon's army.

42:54.523 --> 42:57.617
We had such dreams then.

42:57.693 --> 43:00.560
However, one night...

43:00.629 --> 43:04.087
my regiment ran down...

43:04.166 --> 43:06.293
a band of guerrillas,

43:06.368 --> 43:09.633
who ran into a church
for sanctuary.

43:09.705 --> 43:15.075
I was ordered to burn...
down the church...

43:15.144 --> 43:18.409
with them inside it.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.414
Did you?

43:22.718 --> 43:27.519
To my everlasting shame, I did.

43:27.590 --> 43:29.649
I did.

43:29.725 --> 43:31.750
How did you come to be here?

43:31.827 --> 43:35.024
The following day
I deserted...

43:35.097 --> 43:37.930
to devote my life
to repentance...

43:38.000 --> 43:40.127
and to God.

43:40.202 --> 43:42.864
I worked as
private secretary to...

43:42.938 --> 43:47.773
the enormously wealthy
Count Enrique Spada.

43:47.843 --> 43:51.609
Spada was
a righteous man.

43:51.680 --> 43:56.549
Sadly, a couple
of years later, he died...

43:56.619 --> 44:02.524
amidst rumors that he had
hidden his limitless fortune.

44:02.591 --> 44:04.582
[Grunts]

44:04.660 --> 44:08.096
- Two weeks later, I was arrested.
- Why?

44:08.163 --> 44:12.099
Napoleon wanted
Spada's treasure.

44:12.167 --> 44:17.036
He did not believe that
I had no idea where it was.

44:17.106 --> 44:22.237
So he had me thrown in here
to refresh my memory.

44:22.311 --> 44:26.805
And so here I've remained
with only God...

44:26.882 --> 44:30.215
for company
until he sent me you.

44:30.286 --> 44:32.720
God is no more real
than your treasure, priest.

Perhaps.

[Both Laughing]

44:53.942 --> 44:56.740
Compute this.

44:56.812 --> 45:00.543
2,500 cubic centimeters
of rock and dust a day...

45:00.616 --> 45:04.416
for 365 days.

45:05.487 --> 45:07.921
Equals three-and-a-half
meters a year,

45:07.990 --> 45:10.584
12 feet, a foot a month.

45:10.659 --> 45:13.924

Do not waste the light.

45:32.581 --> 45:35.982
You were a soldier, priest.

45:37.986 --> 45:40.011
So you know weaponry.

45:41.156 --> 45:43.750
[Grunts]

45:45.994 --> 45:47.928
Teach me.

45:50.432 --> 45:52.400
Or dig alone.

45:55.437 --> 46:00.875
You force me to walk
a fine line, Dantes.

46:10.319 --> 46:12.116
This is ridiculous.

46:12.187 --> 46:17.489
The stronger swordsman
does not necessarily win.

46:17.559 --> 46:19.493
It is speed!

46:20.796 --> 46:23.287
Speed of hand.

46:23.365 --> 46:25.629
Speed of mind.

through the drops...

46:30.139 --> 46:32.573
without getting wet.

Time to study.

47:12.948 --> 47:14.916
Define economics.

47:14.983 --> 47:17.383
Economics is the science
that deals with the production,

47:17.453 --> 47:19.580
distribution and
consumption of commodities.

47:19.655 --> 47:21.589

Happy Christmas, Edmond.

47:45.581 --> 47:48.516
Give or take a month or so.

47:52.921 --> 47:55.913
Good. Whom are you fighting?
Danglars? Mondego?

47:55.991 --> 47:57.982
Who do you think?

48:05.834 --> 48:09.099
[Grunts]
Good! Too good.

48:09.171 --> 48:12.004
We have Newton's third law.

48:12.074 --> 48:16.340
There is a reaction
to every action...

48:16.411 --> 48:18.879
in physics... and in man.

48:18.947 --> 48:24.579
Thus my quest for vengeance
is a reaction to the actions
of Danglars and Mondego.

48:24.653 --> 48:27.247
[Exhales]
Up, up.

48:27.322 --> 48:30.348
I want that seat.

48:30.425 --> 48:36.227
You once told me that Villefort
had you rearrested just after...

48:36.298 --> 48:39.096
he had cleared you
of all the charges.

48:39.167 --> 48:40.862
You may go.

48:40.936 --> 48:43.564
Yes, that's true.

48:43.639 --> 48:47.871
Then why would he go
through that charade...

48:47.943 --> 48:53.472
unless he had reason to change his mind
about letting you go?

48:53.549 --> 48:56.541
- Think, Edmond.
- I'm trying.

48:56.618 --> 48:59.712
- What happened?
- He asked me...

48:59.788 --> 49:01.915
Did Napoleon tell you
who was supposed to
pick up this letter?

49:01.990 --> 49:04.151
- I told him...
- A Monsieur Clarion.

49:04.226 --> 49:08.253
- And nothing more?
- Nothing. He burnt the letter
and said I could go.

49:08.330 --> 49:10.525
Ah.

49:10.599 --> 49:15.400
He burned... the letter.

49:20.142 --> 49:22.269
Yes.

49:22.344 --> 49:25.939
Strange that a chief magistrate
would burn evidence...

49:26.014 --> 49:28.915
of a treasonous conspiracy...

49:28.984 --> 49:33.978
and then imprison
the only man...

49:34.056 --> 49:38.254
who was aware of
Monsieur Clarion's connection...

49:38.327 --> 49:40.261
to that conspiracy.

49:44.066 --> 49:48.002
- He was protecting someone.
- Ah.

49:48.070 --> 49:52.734
- A dear friend perhaps?
- No. No.

49:52.808 --> 49:55.538
A politician like Villefort
would have rid himself
of such friends.

49:55.611 --> 49:58.273
Clarion could be a relative.

49:58.347 --> 50:00.542
A close relative, possibly...

50:04.686 --> 50:06.620
No!

50:09.324 --> 50:12.487
Villefort's father was
a colonel in Napoleon's army.

50:12.561 --> 50:15.325
Villefort wasn't
protecting Clarion.

50:15.397 --> 50:18.764
He was protecting himself.

Danglars, who falsely said he saw
Napoleon give me that letter.

50:22.971 --> 50:25.838
Mondego, who told
Villefort I had it.

50:25.907 --> 50:28.239
And Villefort himself,
who sent me here.

I did not know...

58:15.106 --> 58:17.939
Monsieur Dorleac!

58:26.484 --> 58:28.748
Did he, in fact,
have a map?

58:28.820 --> 58:31.050
[Maurice]
No, gov.

58:31.122 --> 58:33.283
[Dorleac]
Where's the, uh...

58:35.460 --> 58:37.985
Stop!

58:38.062 --> 58:39.996
Monsieur Dorleac!

58:40.064 --> 58:42.498
What do you mean, after three?
We throw him at three or before three?

58:42.567 --> 58:46.059
- After three.
- One... two...

58:46.137 --> 58:48.935
- Monsieur Dorleac!
- And th...

58:49.006 --> 58:52.100
- Don't, Mr. Dorleac!
- One...

58:52.176 --> 58:55.805
- two...
- Don't throw the body over the cliff!

58:55.880 --> 58:58.314
- Aah!
- Three!

59:47.632 --> 59:49.566
[Gasps]

01:00:01.946 --> 01:00:04.642
[Gasps]

01:00:24.502 --> 01:00:26.436
[Grunts]

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:32.602
[Panting]

01:00:34.278 --> 01:00:37.805
We could have handled that
a bit better.

01:01:08.679 --> 01:01:10.613
Thank you, priest.

01:01:11.949 --> 01:01:13.883
Thank you.

01:01:20.224 --> 01:01:23.990
[Laughing]

01:01:24.061 --> 01:01:27.724
[Laughing Continues]

01:01:31.936 --> 01:01:36.873
[Whooping, Laughing]

01:01:36.941 --> 01:01:41.207
[Hysterical Laughing]

01:01:48.219 --> 01:01:50.653
So, mi amice,

01:01:50.721 --> 01:01:54.122
I would ask who you are,
but in view of your
shredded clothes...

01:01:54.191 --> 01:01:57.524
and the fact that
the Chateau d'lf is two miles away,

01:01:57.595 --> 01:01:59.426
what's the point?

01:01:59.497 --> 01:02:04.298
As for me, I am Luigi Vampa,
a smuggler and a thief.

01:02:04.368 --> 01:02:07.701
My men and I have come
to this island to bury alive
one of our number...

01:02:07.772 --> 01:02:10.570
who attempted to keep
some stolen gold for himself...

01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:12.871
instead of, uh, sharing it
with his comrades.

01:02:12.943 --> 01:02:16.401
Interestingly enough, there are some
of his more loyal friends...

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.539
who are insisting
that I grant him mercy,

01:02:18.616 --> 01:02:20.584
which, of course,
I cannot do,

01:02:20.651 --> 01:02:24.143
for I would quickly lose control
of the whole crew.

01:02:24.221 --> 01:02:28.658
- That's why you are
such a fortunate find.
- Why is that?

01:02:28.726 --> 01:02:32.093
You provide me with a way
to show a little mercy toJacopo,

01:02:32.163 --> 01:02:34.495
that maggot you see
tied up over there,

01:02:34.565 --> 01:02:37.693
while, at the same time,
not appearing weak.

01:02:37.768 --> 01:02:41.465
And as a special treat,
the lads will get to see
a little sport as well.

01:02:41.539 --> 01:02:43.632
How do I accomplish
all this?

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:47.007
We watch you and Jacopo
fight to the death.

01:02:47.078 --> 01:02:49.945
LfJacopo wins,
we welcome him back to the crew.

01:02:50.014 --> 01:02:52.983
If you win, I have given Jacopo
the chance to live,

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:55.985
even if he did not
take advantage of it,

01:02:56.053 --> 01:02:58.954
and you can take his place
on the boat.

01:02:59.023 --> 01:03:01.514
What if I win,
and I don't want to be a smuggler?

01:03:01.592 --> 01:03:04.993
Then we slit your throat,
and we're a bit shorthanded.

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:08.862
I find that smuggling
is the life for me...

01:03:08.933 --> 01:03:11.629
and would be delighted
to kill your friend, the maggot.

01:03:11.702 --> 01:03:16.401
Oh, uh, by the way,
Jacopo is the best knife
fighter I've ever seen.

01:03:17.508 --> 01:03:19.442
Perhaps you should
get out more.

01:03:23.914 --> 01:03:26.178
ReleaseJacopo
and give him back his knife.

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.218
Then we let
the games begin.

01:03:28.285 --> 01:03:31.686
- [Laughing]
- Get up, maggot.

01:03:41.665 --> 01:03:44.225
- Come on, come on!
- [Yelling]

01:03:44.301 --> 01:03:47.464
[Excited Shouting]

01:03:58.983 --> 01:04:00.610
[Disgusted Muttering]

01:04:00.684 --> 01:04:03.949
As you hope to live,
do not move an eyelash.

01:04:05.689 --> 01:04:08.954
Senor Vampa,
allow Jacopo to live.

01:04:09.026 --> 01:04:12.962
He's already suffered enough
with the prospect of being buried alive.

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:16.158
The men that wanted
to see some sport have seen it.

01:04:16.233 --> 01:04:19.293
Those who wanted mercy
forJacopo will get it.

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:21.964
And by keeping me
and Jacopo,

01:04:22.039 --> 01:04:25.406
you will have yet another skilled sailor
and fighter for your crew.

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.244
It's a deal.

01:04:32.316 --> 01:04:34.750
- What is his name?
- [Man] You've got the devil, Jacopo!

01:04:34.819 --> 01:04:38.846
His name?
We shall call him Zatarra.

01:04:38.923 --> 01:04:43.155
- Sounds fearsome.
- It means driftwood.

01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:45.092
[Men Laughing]

01:04:45.162 --> 01:04:47.596
I swear
on my dead relatives,

01:04:47.665 --> 01:04:50.930
even on the ones
that are not feeling too good,

01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:53.526
I am your man forever.

01:04:54.805 --> 01:04:56.739
I know.

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:22.624
[Chuckling]
Eyes in the back of your head.

01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:26.160
[Bell Ringing]

01:05:26.237 --> 01:05:28.398
Have you never seen
Marseilles before?

01:05:30.241 --> 01:05:32.402
It was my home.

01:05:32.476 --> 01:05:35.968
But you do not join
the others ashore.

01:05:36.046 --> 01:05:39.846
- [Man] Over here!
- Listen to me, Zatarra.

01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:44.149
Whatever happened to you,
you cannot make it right
by staying here on this boat.

01:05:44.221 --> 01:05:47.554
Go. It's up to you.

01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:51.992
"We are kings or pawns,"
a man once said.

01:05:52.062 --> 01:05:54.155
Si.
Who told you this?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.594
Napoleon Bonaparte.

01:06:01.071 --> 01:06:03.005
Bonaparte?

01:06:03.073 --> 01:06:05.007
[Laughing Continues]

01:06:05.075 --> 01:06:08.567
Oh, Zatarra,
the stories you tell.

01:06:08.646 --> 01:06:10.671
[Laughing]

01:06:10.748 --> 01:06:13.876
Someday I may come
to find you.

01:06:15.085 --> 01:06:17.952
A man is always in need
of a good friend.

01:06:19.356 --> 01:06:21.290
Truly.

01:06:29.199 --> 01:06:32.396
[Seagull Squawking]

01:06:35.639 --> 01:06:38.199
[Morell's Voice]
Danglars, what's happened?

01:06:38.275 --> 01:06:42.769
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,
and Edmond Dantes disobeyed my orders.

01:07:07.004 --> 01:07:09.632
Zatarra,
are you all right?

01:07:09.707 --> 01:07:11.641
Everything's changed.

01:07:13.844 --> 01:07:17.439
I want you to buy a boat,
just something the two of us can handle.

01:07:17.514 --> 01:07:22.008
Wait for me to return.
I make my next visit alone.

01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:30.360
Is... Is this the home
of Monsieur Morell?

01:07:30.427 --> 01:07:33.726
My grandfather
isn't well, monsieur.

01:07:33.797 --> 01:07:37.198
Even if he were,
he would not receive visitors
at 11:00 in the evening.

01:07:37.267 --> 01:07:39.565
Perhaps he might make
an exception...

01:07:39.636 --> 01:07:42.298
for a man who is seeking
E-Edmond Dantes.

01:07:42.373 --> 01:07:44.773
[Dog Barking]

01:07:44.842 --> 01:07:46.969
I apologize
for the hour.

01:07:47.044 --> 01:07:49.410
Old people never sleep.
Sit down, sit down.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.507
- Julianne, some sherry.
- [Sighs]

01:07:53.584 --> 01:07:56.576
So, Monsieur Zatarra,

01:07:56.653 --> 01:07:59.053
you were a friend
of Edmond?

01:07:59.123 --> 01:08:01.523
- Monsieur Morell?
- Yes?

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:15.864
You knew... Edmond also?

01:08:15.939 --> 01:08:17.872
Like a son.

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.111
I was hoping you could tell me where
to find his family.

01:08:25.182 --> 01:08:28.207
Unfortunately,
his father hanged himself...

01:08:28.285 --> 01:08:32.051
after learning
of Edmond's treason.

01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:34.453
[Whispers] I see.

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:36.459
I see.

01:08:36.527 --> 01:08:38.461
And...

01:08:39.763 --> 01:08:44.223
this...
treason you speak of...

01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:47.099
- Who accused him?
- Who knows?

01:08:47.171 --> 01:08:50.834
Monsieur Villefort,
the man who had Edmond arrested,

01:08:50.908 --> 01:08:53.569
left for Paris soon after
to take up the post...

01:08:53.644 --> 01:08:55.612
of chief prosecutor.

01:08:55.679 --> 01:08:59.011
Of course, the shock of his father's
violent murder...

01:08:59.082 --> 01:09:01.676
may also have spurred
his departure.

01:09:03.053 --> 01:09:06.283
They were strange times.

01:09:06.356 --> 01:09:10.486
You seem to have fallen
on difficult times yourself, sir.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.258
After Edmond's death,
I reluctantly took on a partner.

01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:17.767
- [Puts Bottle Down]
- One of my captains.

01:09:17.835 --> 01:09:21.236
And then one day,
Danglars forced me out.

01:09:21.305 --> 01:09:23.033
[Morell Sighs]

01:09:23.107 --> 01:09:26.234
My fate is nothing
compared to Edmond's.

01:09:28.979 --> 01:09:31.277
Perhaps your luck
is about to change.

01:09:32.282 --> 01:09:34.216
[Scoffs]

01:09:35.285 --> 01:09:37.719
I shall search out
Edmond's fiancee.

01:09:37.787 --> 01:09:39.915
You mean
the Countess Mondego?

01:09:42.459 --> 01:09:44.893
- Countess?
- Yes.

01:09:44.962 --> 01:09:47.897
A month after poor Edmond
was arrested,

01:09:47.965 --> 01:09:50.160
Mercedes wed
his best friend.

01:09:51.568 --> 01:09:53.899
- Fernand.
- Yes, that's right.

01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:56.906
And with the death
of his father and brother in the war,

01:09:56.974 --> 01:09:59.841
Fernand became Count Mondego.

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:02.572
They live in Paris now.

01:10:03.714 --> 01:10:06.080
Count and Countess Mondego.

01:10:10.721 --> 01:10:12.780
Are you all right?

01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:18.454
Yes. I must go.

01:10:18.529 --> 01:10:21.623
- I'm sorry I was not more helpful.
- Oh, no.

01:10:21.698 --> 01:10:24.166
You told me
what I needed to know.

01:10:25.936 --> 01:10:28.370
Edmond Dantes is dead.

01:10:30.207 --> 01:10:33.699
[Footsteps Retreating]

01:10:38.682 --> 01:10:41.776
Zatarra.
Zatarra, you will be so proud of me.

01:10:41.852 --> 01:10:44.787
I found a nice little skiff.
We couldn't afford a sloop.

01:10:44.855 --> 01:10:47.221
Got a really good deal.
Za-Zatarra?

01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:49.225
Zatarra.

01:13:42.999 --> 01:13:46.662
Zatarra, the boat
cannot hold no more,

01:13:46.737 --> 01:13:49.570
and there are at least
eight more boatloads down there!

01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:55.606
Do you not understand?

01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:59.945
You are wealthier than any man
I have ever heard of.

01:14:01.351 --> 01:14:05.378
Whatever your problems were,
they are over.

01:14:05.455 --> 01:14:08.891
What do you want to buy?

01:14:08.959 --> 01:14:10.893
Revenge.

01:14:10.961 --> 01:14:13.930
Okay, revenge. Who?

01:14:13.997 --> 01:14:16.966
Danglars, Villefort,

01:14:17.033 --> 01:14:19.024
Fernand and Mercedes.

01:14:19.102 --> 01:14:21.036
Right.

01:14:21.104 --> 01:14:23.902
We kill these people,
then we spend the treasure.

01:14:23.974 --> 01:14:27.910
No, we will study them,
learn their weaknesses.

01:14:27.978 --> 01:14:30.412
Why not just kill them?
I'll do it.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.244
I'll run up to Paris...
bam, bam, bam, bam!

01:14:33.316 --> 01:14:36.080
I'm back before week's end.
We spend the treasure.

01:14:36.153 --> 01:14:38.087
How is this a bad plan?

01:14:38.155 --> 01:14:41.249
Death is too good for them.

01:14:41.324 --> 01:14:44.191
They must suffer
as I suffered.

01:14:44.261 --> 01:14:46.923
They must see their world,
all they hold dear,

01:14:46.997 --> 01:14:49.522
ripped from them
as it was ripped from me.

01:14:54.004 --> 01:14:58.304
You will need a better name than Zatarra
if you are to accomplish that.

01:15:04.614 --> 01:15:06.741
Then I shall
become a count.

good afternoon, sir.

01:17:12.142 --> 01:17:15.168
the Count of Monte Cristo.

01:17:22.953 --> 01:17:25.854
[Fireworks Continue]

01:17:28.925 --> 01:17:31.018
It's so beautiful.

01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:41.697
Greetings.

01:18:41.765 --> 01:18:43.596
[Crowd Murmuring]

01:18:43.667 --> 01:18:46.761
[Excited Chattering]

01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:51.732
My dear count, allow me to introduce
to you my husband,

01:18:51.808 --> 01:18:54.003
Monsieur Villefort,
Chief Prosecutor.

01:18:54.077 --> 01:18:56.011
Very kind of you
to think of us.

01:18:56.079 --> 01:18:58.912
Oh, I am the one honored
with your presence.

01:18:58.982 --> 01:19:02.281
Now, please,
enjoy yourselves tonight.

01:19:04.154 --> 01:19:06.384
What do we know about him?

01:19:06.456 --> 01:19:08.390
Not enough.

01:19:08.458 --> 01:19:10.824
Where are they?
Are you sure you invited them?

01:19:10.894 --> 01:19:12.828
Yes, Your Grace.

01:19:12.896 --> 01:19:16.923
But I just learned that Count Mondego
has retired for the evening.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.491
He has a morning appointment
he cannot miss.

01:19:42.459 --> 01:19:45.758
[Groaning]

01:19:45.829 --> 01:19:47.763
[Doors Slam]

01:19:52.802 --> 01:19:57.501
[Clock Bell Dinging]

01:19:57.574 --> 01:19:59.940
You're up early, my dear.

01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:02.944
Is the Viscount Tourville dead?

01:20:03.012 --> 01:20:07.142
Unless his heart is situated somewhere
other than the left side of his chest,

01:20:07.217 --> 01:20:09.276
I suspect he is.

01:20:11.254 --> 01:20:14.018
God grant him peace.

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:16.854
He did no more than defend
his family's honor.

01:20:16.926 --> 01:20:20.259
Much good it did him.

01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:24.596
His wife and I
were happy in our passion.
You were happy in your ignorance.

01:20:24.667 --> 01:20:27.431
Now comes the viscount's
valiant defense of his honor,

01:20:27.504 --> 01:20:29.438
and you are pained.

01:20:29.506 --> 01:20:32.600
- She is ruined, and he is dead.
- Don't flatter yourself.

01:20:32.675 --> 01:20:37.203
I was neither happy
nor ignorant,

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.046
having known about the last three women
before Madame Tourville.

01:20:41.117 --> 01:20:44.052
I'm sorry you
are humiliated.

01:20:45.955 --> 01:20:49.482
The combination of Paris
and me is hardly a recipe for fidelity.

01:20:49.559 --> 01:20:52.858
And since my attempts at discretion
have evidently failed,

01:20:52.929 --> 01:20:56.057
there seems little point
in keeping up pretenses.

01:20:58.201 --> 01:21:01.534
It's actually quite...
liberating.

01:21:01.604 --> 01:21:03.538
Wouldn't you say?

01:21:05.975 --> 01:21:07.909
[Edmond]
His finances?

01:21:07.977 --> 01:21:10.241
[Jacopo] He's losing money
at the other casinos.

01:21:10.313 --> 01:21:12.247
They're not even
cheating him.

01:21:12.315 --> 01:21:14.249
Have you looked
into his shipping?

01:21:14.317 --> 01:21:17.115
He got a bank loan for his own boat
several years ago.

01:21:17.187 --> 01:21:20.588
- Doesn't use Danglars.
- Make sure we own
that bank by tomorrow.

01:21:20.657 --> 01:21:24.593
Tell the other shipping
companies to stay away from Mondego.

01:21:24.661 --> 01:21:27.255
I want to give him no choice
but to crawl back to Danglars.

01:21:27.330 --> 01:21:31.699
Now, tell the dealers...
take it all.

01:21:34.604 --> 01:21:37.198
Do try to understand.

01:21:37.273 --> 01:21:40.208
I have a very large
consignment of cotton ready to be sent,

01:21:40.276 --> 01:21:43.837
and I shall make my payment on the ship
as soon as it is delivered.

01:21:43.913 --> 01:21:47.872
So obviously I need the vessel
in order to deliver it.

01:21:47.951 --> 01:21:52.513
Unfortunately,
the bank can offer no further
extensions, Count Mondego.

01:21:52.589 --> 01:21:56.047
I suggest you find
alternate means of shipping.

01:21:57.794 --> 01:22:00.388
[Horse Whinnying]

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:08.669
Well, well. To what do I owe the honor,
Count Mondego?

01:22:08.738 --> 01:22:12.572
Can't imagine why you've been
avoiding me after all these years.

01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:16.344
I'm prepared
to overlook your faults...

01:22:16.412 --> 01:22:18.346
and perhaps resume
our dealings.

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:23.048
Business not going
so well these days?

01:22:24.153 --> 01:22:26.417
[Wheezing Laugh]

01:22:36.332 --> 01:22:38.266
Zatarra?

01:22:49.078 --> 01:22:51.012
Jacopo.

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.105
Did you fall off the bed?

01:22:53.182 --> 01:22:57.915
After 13 years of sleeping
on a stone slab, I can't.

01:22:57.987 --> 01:23:01.081
Mi Maria.
Does that hurt?

01:23:03.693 --> 01:23:05.627
Did you come here
for a reason?

01:23:05.695 --> 01:23:08.220
Mondego has a son.

01:23:15.305 --> 01:23:18.638
- Albert wishes to talk with us.
- Not now!

01:23:18.708 --> 01:23:21.302
Tell him I'm trying
to protect his inheritance.

01:23:21.377 --> 01:23:24.312
Are you afraid he's
going to squander his as you have yours?

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:28.248
I don't recall hearing your
complaints when I elevated you
from a fishmonger's daughter.

01:23:28.318 --> 01:23:30.582
Please, I must finish this,
then I shall be going out.

01:23:30.653 --> 01:23:33.588
May I remind you, my love,
that in Paris there are
mistresses aplenty,

01:23:33.656 --> 01:23:37.114
but you have
only one son.

01:23:37.193 --> 01:23:39.127
Come in, Albert.

01:23:40.496 --> 01:23:44.262
- For God's sake, be brief.
- I will, Father.

01:23:44.334 --> 01:23:48.327
Several of my friends
are going to Rome for two weeks
during Carnival.

01:23:48.404 --> 01:23:50.565
- I would like to accompany them.
- Rome?

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.269
- And no chaperons? You're only 15.
- Almost 16.

01:23:54.344 --> 01:23:56.778
Make it my birthday present,
Father, please.

01:23:56.846 --> 01:23:58.837
- I won't get into trouble.
- No.

01:23:58.915 --> 01:24:02.373
Of course he can go.
I could do with some peace
and quiet around here.

01:24:06.489 --> 01:24:08.184
- Rome!
- [Cheering]

01:24:08.257 --> 01:24:11.124
[Shouting]

01:24:11.194 --> 01:24:14.129
[Upbeat]

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:23.966
[Gasping, Yelling]

01:24:25.308 --> 01:24:28.607
[Man]
Albert! Albert!

01:24:28.678 --> 01:24:31.146
- Over here! Over here!
- Over here!

01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:22.964
Milady?

01:25:24.867 --> 01:25:26.835
Can't hide forever.

01:25:26.903 --> 01:25:28.837
Milady?
[Grunts]

01:25:34.477 --> 01:25:36.911
Who are you, and why
are you doing this?

01:25:36.979 --> 01:25:39.914
- We are bad men, and for the money.
- My money is in my waistcoat.

01:25:39.982 --> 01:25:44.419
Not anymore.
Besides, it's not your money
we're interested in.

01:25:44.487 --> 01:25:47.422
You are the only son
of Count Mondego, are you not?

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:50.425
Ransom?
Send your note and be damned.

01:25:50.493 --> 01:25:54.429
I wish it were that easy,
but a note won't reach
your father for two weeks,

01:25:54.497 --> 01:25:57.830
and then there's the endless
debates about whether
we killed you already.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:03.395
No, a note just doesn't have the impact.
Perhaps if we send him your ring.

01:26:03.473 --> 01:26:06.067
Yes. My ring bears
the Mondego crest.

01:26:06.142 --> 01:26:10.169
- While still attached to your finger?
- [Men Laughing]

01:26:12.815 --> 01:26:14.749
Listen to me, vermin.

01:26:14.817 --> 01:26:17.479
I am Albert, son of Fernand,
Count Mondego,

01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:21.614
and you have had your last laugh
at my expense.

01:26:21.691 --> 01:26:25.718
- Do your worst.
- If you insist. Peppone, the knife.

01:26:44.247 --> 01:26:46.408
Cut this boy's ropes,

01:26:46.482 --> 01:26:49.974
or I will be forced to start cutting
your miserable corpses.

01:26:50.052 --> 01:26:51.986
Now!

01:26:55.725 --> 01:26:58.285
Follow me, young man.
You see the surface? Wait for me there.

01:26:58.361 --> 01:27:01.262
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Go. We'll talk later.

01:27:06.903 --> 01:27:08.928
Well done, gentlemen.

01:27:13.009 --> 01:27:16.001
Many thanks, Your Grace.

01:27:16.078 --> 01:27:18.012
Albert.

01:27:19.348 --> 01:27:21.282
Are you all right?

01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:23.875
Sir, I owe you my life.

01:27:23.953 --> 01:27:26.012
You've had quite an ordeal.

01:27:26.088 --> 01:27:28.716
You're an extraordinary young man.

01:27:30.293 --> 01:27:33.729
I insist, you must come to my estate
for breakfast tomorrow.

01:27:33.796 --> 01:27:36.492
Agreed?

01:27:36.566 --> 01:27:38.500
Agreed.

01:27:39.969 --> 01:27:42.233
May I ask
who you are, sir?

01:27:42.305 --> 01:27:45.570
For the present, your friend.
Tomorrow, your host.

01:27:45.641 --> 01:27:48.474
For the short time
formality stands between us,

01:27:48.544 --> 01:27:50.739
the Count of Monte Cristo.

01:28:23.479 --> 01:28:25.709
He's out in the waiting room.

01:28:27.283 --> 01:28:29.376
He showed courage
in the tunnels.

01:28:29.452 --> 01:28:31.886
He's a means to an end.

01:28:36.459 --> 01:28:38.450
Yes, Your Grace.

01:28:40.396 --> 01:28:42.330
Young man.

01:28:43.933 --> 01:28:47.596
Albert, come in. Come, come.

01:28:48.804 --> 01:28:50.863
Come on.

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.272
- You've had quite a night.
- Yes.

01:28:53.342 --> 01:28:55.469
[Albert]
What an adventure.

01:28:55.544 --> 01:28:58.274
Everything's an adventure
when you're young.

01:28:58.347 --> 01:29:00.907
- One thing puzzles me, sir.
- Hmm.

01:29:00.983 --> 01:29:03.417
How did you come to know
of my kidnapping?

01:29:03.486 --> 01:29:05.818
I have many connections,

01:29:05.888 --> 01:29:08.755
some of which
are less than reputable.

01:29:08.824 --> 01:29:13.420
I pay well to be informed
of anything of note
in any city in which I stay.

01:29:13.496 --> 01:29:16.056
And the kidnapping
of a count's son is of note.

01:29:18.334 --> 01:29:21.132
But why risk your life
rescuing me?

01:29:21.203 --> 01:29:23.603
The son
of a fellow noble.

01:29:23.673 --> 01:29:25.607
It was the least
I could do.

01:29:25.675 --> 01:29:29.634
Judging by your character,
I'm sure you would have done the same.

01:29:29.712 --> 01:29:32.579
Your father will
be proud of you.

01:29:45.428 --> 01:29:48.795
You must come to Paris
and meet my parents so they
may thank you in person.

01:29:48.864 --> 01:29:52.630
Unfortunately, I cannot.
Business, you see.

01:29:52.702 --> 01:29:55.296
Please, it is
a matter of honor.

01:29:57.506 --> 01:30:01.442
- Jacopo?
- Yes, Your Grace?

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:03.774
The Spada matter...
where do we stand?

01:30:03.846 --> 01:30:06.542
- Even now, the gold...
- The shipment?

01:30:06.615 --> 01:30:10.278
Oh, l-I'm sorry, Your Grace.
The shipment is in transit,

01:30:10.353 --> 01:30:13.288
uh, bound for Marseilles.

01:30:13.356 --> 01:30:17.224
- And it arrives?
- Not for another three weeks,
Your Grace.

01:30:17.293 --> 01:30:20.456
Three weeks? That's more
than enough time to visit in Paris.

01:30:23.099 --> 01:30:25.192
- Very well.
- Excellent.

01:30:25.267 --> 01:30:28.964
- And you'll be there just in time.
- In time for?

[Chattering, Laughing]

01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:49.815
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

Count!

- Albert.
- Your Grace. Father!

01:31:16.152 --> 01:31:19.212
May I present
the Count of Monte Cristo.

01:31:19.288 --> 01:31:22.348
- 'Tis a pleasure.
- The pleasure is mine,
Count Mondego.

01:31:22.425 --> 01:31:25.758
I've been looking forward
to this moment for some time.

01:31:25.828 --> 01:31:28.422
You do me much honor,
when it is I who are indebted to you...

01:31:28.497 --> 01:31:31.261
for the rescue of my son.

01:31:33.869 --> 01:31:36.736
May I present
the Countess Mondego.

01:31:45.347 --> 01:31:47.281
Mercedes.

01:31:55.324 --> 01:31:57.258
Countess.

01:32:00.296 --> 01:32:03.891
You would have to be a mother
to truly appreciate the service...

01:32:03.966 --> 01:32:06.730
you've done
for my son and me.

01:32:06.802 --> 01:32:09.327
Monsieur, I shall never forget you.

01:32:09.405 --> 01:32:11.965
Please, madame,

01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:13.975
it was nothing.

01:32:14.043 --> 01:32:17.809
I am sure that within a month,
you will not even remember my name.

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.644
Hmm?

01:32:20.716 --> 01:32:22.809
May I steal your wife?

01:32:22.885 --> 01:32:25.945
- I'm sorry?
- For the waltz.

01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:28.182
Of course.

01:32:32.595 --> 01:32:35.257
Isn't he wonderful, Father?

- What's the matter?
- Uh, nothing.

01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:56.049
You just remind me
of someone from long ago,

01:32:58.687 --> 01:33:00.746
someone who was
very dear to me.

01:33:00.823 --> 01:33:04.054
I'm flattered.
What happened to him?

01:33:04.126 --> 01:33:06.822
He died.

01:33:08.163 --> 01:33:10.791
But I'm not that man.

- Oh, Madame Villefort, monsieur.

01:33:35.658 --> 01:33:38.593
I'm so glad you could come to see me
while I'm still in town.

01:33:38.661 --> 01:33:42.028
- We were delightfully
surprised to get your note.
- Thank you.

01:33:42.097 --> 01:33:45.760
Would you be so kind
as to excuse your husband
and I for a moment?

01:33:47.603 --> 01:33:51.596
I'm told you are an expert
in the interpretation
of the law.

01:33:51.674 --> 01:33:55.201
I have a certain matter
that perhaps you could
help me with.

01:34:03.018 --> 01:34:05.248
Excuse me.

01:34:05.421 --> 01:34:10.017
Fernand. Fernand!
The toast!

01:34:10.159 --> 01:34:13.128
Not right now.
I have state business to attend to.

01:34:13.195 --> 01:34:16.289
Our guests expect it.
Albert expects it.

01:34:16.365 --> 01:34:18.765
You give it, my dear.
I'm sure it'll be splendid.

01:34:18.834 --> 01:34:21.132
You are his father!

01:34:21.203 --> 01:34:25.105
It is the least you can do.
You know how he admires you.

01:34:25.174 --> 01:34:27.142
Then he will forgive
my absence.

01:34:27.209 --> 01:34:29.040
But...

01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:33.448
I thought we agreed
not to meet socially.

01:34:35.217 --> 01:34:38.482
How could I pass up
the Count of Monte Cristo?

01:34:40.055 --> 01:34:42.751
Quite.

01:34:42.825 --> 01:34:45.953
- What do you know of him?
- He's foreign,

01:34:46.028 --> 01:34:48.428
rich.

01:34:48.497 --> 01:34:50.658
I hear he aided
your son.

01:34:50.733 --> 01:34:54.396
- Why does he seek your counsel?
- Why should I tell you?

01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:58.099
When my son
returned from Rome,

01:34:58.173 --> 01:35:01.574
he mentioned he'd
heard Monte Cristo saying
he was expecting a shipment.

01:35:01.644 --> 01:35:04.238
He also heard the words "gold"...

01:35:04.313 --> 01:35:06.110
and "Spada."

01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:10.978
- Hmm.
- You don't believe...

01:35:11.053 --> 01:35:13.578
Monte Cristo has found
the treasure of Spada.

01:35:13.656 --> 01:35:16.750
Not an hour ago,
he asked me to help him avoid
troublesome inspections...

01:35:16.825 --> 01:35:19.293
on a shipment coming
from Marseilles.

01:35:19.361 --> 01:35:21.829
- Hmm.
- I could have him arrested.

01:35:21.897 --> 01:35:25.799
Don't do that.
Let's just relieve him of it.

01:35:25.868 --> 01:35:29.497
- How do you propose...
- I have an acquaintance
who deals in these matters.

01:35:29.571 --> 01:35:32.165
Tell Monte Cristo
you'll get his shipment through Customs,

01:35:32.241 --> 01:35:35.233
but that it will
have to stay in port overnight.

01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:39.041
I shall have it removed
and taken to my old family
estate in Bouchon,

01:35:39.114 --> 01:35:41.639
where we shall meet
the following day.

01:35:45.587 --> 01:35:47.521
I require 70 percent.

01:35:47.589 --> 01:35:49.784
And yet you'll only get 50.

01:35:49.858 --> 01:35:51.792
Done.

01:36:00.335 --> 01:36:02.633

[Conversation Quiets]

01:36:19.254 --> 01:36:21.882
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:36:21.957 --> 01:36:25.324
unfortunately, my husband has been
detained by business.

01:36:25.394 --> 01:36:31.230
And so it is
left up to me to...

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.495
To introduce you...

01:36:33.569 --> 01:36:35.935
to the Count of Monte Cristo
yet again.

01:36:36.004 --> 01:36:39.770
You see, I had the audacity
to beg the count...

01:36:39.842 --> 01:36:42.675
to allow me to give
the birthday toast to Albert.

01:36:42.745 --> 01:36:46.442
I was so insistent, and such
is the graciousness of our host,

01:36:46.515 --> 01:36:49.348
that he reluctantly gave up
his fatherly right...

01:36:49.418 --> 01:36:51.682
in order to accommodate a guest,

01:36:51.754 --> 01:36:53.688
even one as boorish
as myself.

01:36:53.756 --> 01:36:56.418
- Ahh.
- [Murmuring]

01:36:56.492 --> 01:36:58.551
Young Albert
has made far too much...

01:36:58.627 --> 01:37:01.221
of the assistance
I gave him in Rome.

01:37:01.296 --> 01:37:03.230
When I arrived
in the catacombs,

01:37:03.298 --> 01:37:06.358
I watched as the criminals,
who tied Albert to a wall,

01:37:06.435 --> 01:37:09.097
threatened to cut off
his finger and send it to his father...

01:37:09.171 --> 01:37:11.105
as evidence
of his abduction.

01:37:11.173 --> 01:37:13.038
[Woman]
Goodness!

01:37:13.108 --> 01:37:17.306
The boy's reply to all this was...
"Do your worst."

[All Gasping]

01:37:19.848 --> 01:37:22.646
Life is a storm,
my young friend.

01:37:22.718 --> 01:37:24.948
You will bask
in the sunlight one moment,

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.648
be shattered on the rocks
the next.

01:37:27.723 --> 01:37:29.884
What makes you a man...

01:37:29.958 --> 01:37:33.394
is what you do
when that storm comes.

01:37:33.462 --> 01:37:37.193
You must look into that storm
and shout, as you did in Rome,

01:37:37.266 --> 01:37:39.598
"Do your worst...

01:37:39.668 --> 01:37:41.602
for I will do mine."

01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:45.572
Then the fates will know you
as we know you,

01:37:45.641 --> 01:37:49.236
as Albert Mondego,

that you were executed.

- Did he?
- Oh, God.

01:38:58.276 --> 01:39:00.676
- Countess, you are mistaken.
Back to the Mondegos'.
- No!

01:39:00.745 --> 01:39:03.145
- Madame, I'm only thinking
of your reputation.
- I beg you, Edmond.

01:39:03.215 --> 01:39:05.206
- I don't care how you returned.
- I am not this Edmond.

A spirit?
Some ghost sent to torment me?

01:39:26.972 --> 01:39:29.839
This Edmond,
you loved him?

01:39:29.908 --> 01:39:31.899
Yes.

01:39:31.977 --> 01:39:34.241
For how long?

01:39:34.312 --> 01:39:37.076
For all of my life.

01:39:37.148 --> 01:39:41.346
And how long after he died
before you married the count?

01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:44.911
That isn't fair.

01:39:49.327 --> 01:39:52.819
We've reached your home,
Countess.

01:40:08.346 --> 01:40:13.943
You're right.
You cannot be my Edmond.

01:40:14.019 --> 01:40:17.182
Well, there you are.
You said it yourself.

to interfere in my affairs,

I started the day we met.

- I understand you are mad.
- Mad?

into my traps perfectly.

a beautiful woman who loves you.

take the woman and live your life.

could be the start of a long
and fruitful relationship.

may I pose a question?

Yes, of course.
Anything in the world.

01:44:47.458 --> 01:44:50.950
I was just curious.

Why did you tell
Countess Mondego 16 years ago...

01:44:54.933 --> 01:44:58.232
that Edmond Dantes
had been executed?

01:44:58.303 --> 01:45:00.237

Uh, I don't understand.

01:45:04.142 --> 01:45:07.202
It's a perfectly
simple question.

01:45:07.278 --> 01:45:09.075
How do you know these things?

01:45:10.848 --> 01:45:13.681
- [Grinding Sound]
- That's, uh...

01:45:13.751 --> 01:45:16.242
That's quite enough.

01:45:16.321 --> 01:45:19.654
Whew! You don't understand.
Dantes was accepting
a letter from Napoleon.

01:45:19.724 --> 01:45:22.716
- That was clearly treason.
- But we both know
he never delivered it.

01:45:22.794 --> 01:45:26.161
Packing a man off to prison
with such knowledge
is bad enough. But to tell...

01:45:26.231 --> 01:45:29.029
Your Grace, I have no idea
what is provoking
this perverse discussion.

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:33.594
Now I ask myself,
"What did my old friend
Villefort stand to gain...

01:45:33.671 --> 01:45:37.004
by telling Mercedes
that Edmond Dantes is dead?"

01:45:39.010 --> 01:45:42.207
The answer is...
absolutely nothing.

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:44.840
Just as you say, nothing.
So why...

01:45:44.916 --> 01:45:47.407
But if my old friend,
now chief prosecutor of France,

01:45:47.485 --> 01:45:50.113
doesn't gain from this lie,
well, who does?

01:45:52.290 --> 01:45:55.282
My dear Count, it's far too hot in here
and you're fully dressed.

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.090
- It's time we both left.
- I think the clearest beneficiary...

01:45:58.162 --> 01:46:00.187
is Fernand, Count Mondego.

01:46:03.701 --> 01:46:07.228
I don't understand what
this inquisition has to do
with our business relationship.

01:46:07.305 --> 01:46:09.637
I'm about to tell you.

01:46:12.677 --> 01:46:14.611
Sit down, Mondego.

01:46:16.114 --> 01:46:18.947
I'm an ambitious man.
And I have furthered these ambitions...

01:46:19.017 --> 01:46:21.247
by scooping up Bonapartists.

01:46:22.654 --> 01:46:24.645
But now with Napoleon
on the loose, I have,

01:46:24.722 --> 01:46:27.213
shall I say,
a thorn in my side.

01:46:27.292 --> 01:46:30.284
Once merely an irritation,
now potentially lethal.

01:46:30.361 --> 01:46:33.125
- Be lethal in turn.
- Well, the problem is such...

01:46:33.197 --> 01:46:35.688
that I, myself,
cannot attend to it.

01:46:35.767 --> 01:46:37.997

for you.

from this room at once.

You've proved yourself
no friend of mine.

Your father was a loyal supporter
of Napoleon, wasn't he?

Possibly involved in plotting
Napoleon's escape from Elba.

You have no proof,
no witnesses.

01:47:44.836 --> 01:47:48.033
You just have theories.
J-Just conjectures.

01:47:48.106 --> 01:47:50.540
On the contrary.
I have Count Mondego.

01:47:52.710 --> 01:47:55.372
Young Mondego. Why?

01:47:55.446 --> 01:47:57.937
Because your son
lacked the courage.

01:48:00.551 --> 01:48:02.883
[Villefort's Voice] Mondego is the one
who pulled the trigger!

01:48:02.954 --> 01:48:05.047
He'd never confess
in a million years!

01:48:05.123 --> 01:48:07.683
You're right,
he wouldn't.

01:48:07.759 --> 01:48:12.025
- But you just have.
- [Steam Hisses]

01:48:14.332 --> 01:48:19.031
Monsieur Villefort,
you are under arrest
for conspiracy to murder.

01:48:19.103 --> 01:48:22.595
You remember?

01:48:26.511 --> 01:48:29.878
Dantes?

01:48:51.536 --> 01:48:54.198
A courtesy for a gentleman.

01:48:57.141 --> 01:48:59.871
[Door Closes]

01:49:06.951 --> 01:49:09.943
[Chuckling]

01:49:18.296 --> 01:49:20.628
- [Clicks]
- [Panting]

01:49:20.698 --> 01:49:23.394
You didn't think
I'd make it that easy, did you?

01:49:23.468 --> 01:49:25.402
[Man]
Hyah!

01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.781
Edmond?

01:49:51.128 --> 01:49:54.495
I thought we had
finished our conversation
in the carriage.

01:49:54.565 --> 01:49:57.398
So did I.

01:49:58.736 --> 01:50:01.569
Until I realized...

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:06.804
you said the name "Dantes."

01:50:06.878 --> 01:50:10.439
A name that
I had never mentioned.

01:50:14.886 --> 01:50:18.049
What do you want of me?

01:50:18.122 --> 01:50:20.955
I want to be free of you,

01:50:21.025 --> 01:50:24.017
the way you obviously
are free of me.

01:50:26.264 --> 01:50:29.756
Just a few answers from you,
and I shall be gone forever.

01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:35.103
Ask your questions.

01:50:43.314 --> 01:50:45.305
Where have you been?

01:50:47.985 --> 01:50:51.477
Thirteen years in
the Chateau d'lf...

01:50:51.556 --> 01:50:53.524
and everywhere else
you can imagine.

01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.593
The Chateau d'lf
for 13 years.

01:51:03.367 --> 01:51:05.358
Did you suffer?

01:51:05.436 --> 01:51:10.601
[Scoffs] Are you finished now?
I have a good deal on my mind.

01:51:10.675 --> 01:51:12.836
- What happened afterward?
- Much.

01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:15.242
- Why did you not come to me?
- Why did you not wait?

01:51:15.313 --> 01:51:17.838
You married the very man
who betrayed...

01:51:17.915 --> 01:51:23.717
I told you that night
on the rocks, remember?

01:51:23.788 --> 01:51:29.283
That it would never leave my finger.
And it never has.

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:33.353
- Why?
- You know why.

01:51:35.266 --> 01:51:38.429
If you ever loved me,

01:51:38.502 --> 01:51:40.936
don't...
don't rob me of my hate.

01:51:41.005 --> 01:51:42.939
It's all I have.

01:51:43.007 --> 01:51:47.603
Let it go, Edmond.
Let it go.

01:51:47.678 --> 01:51:50.977
I don't know what dark plan
lies within you.

01:51:51.048 --> 01:51:53.539
Nor do I know by what design
we were asked...

01:51:53.618 --> 01:51:55.950
to live without
each other these 16 years.

01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:59.012
- But God has offered us
a new beginning...
- God?

01:51:59.090 --> 01:52:01.923
Don't slap His hand away.

01:52:01.993 --> 01:52:03.927
Can I never escape Him?

01:52:03.995 --> 01:52:08.989
No. He is in everything.

01:52:11.068 --> 01:52:14.765
Even in a kiss.

01:53:00.685 --> 01:53:04.678
[Birds Twittering]

01:53:04.755 --> 01:53:07.189
[Knocking On Door]

01:53:07.258 --> 01:53:10.125
My lady?

01:53:10.194 --> 01:53:12.856
Where's the count?

01:53:12.930 --> 01:53:16.093
Um, the count would like
for you to join him this afternoon.

01:53:16.167 --> 01:53:19.159
- Join him?
- Uh, yes,

01:53:19.236 --> 01:53:23.570
in, uh, leaving the country
with your son.

01:53:26.477 --> 01:53:29.742
Mmm, uh, I'll have someone
bring you to your house...

01:53:29.814 --> 01:53:31.372
and you just
wait there for me.

01:53:31.449 --> 01:53:33.781
- And we just...
- Thank you!

01:53:33.851 --> 01:53:36.411
- Yes, yes, but...
- I need to go home and pack.

01:53:36.487 --> 01:53:38.421
Yes, yes. My lady...

01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:45.593
- Where's the count?
- Upstairs, my lady.

01:53:54.305 --> 01:53:56.273
What's wrong?

01:53:56.340 --> 01:54:01.676
I'm bankrupt.
All my debts have been called in.

01:54:01.746 --> 01:54:04.579
- Also, I'm to be arrested.
- For what?

01:54:04.648 --> 01:54:07.640
Piracy, corruption
and murder.

01:54:07.718 --> 01:54:11.279
- Did you do all these things?
- Yes.

01:54:11.355 --> 01:54:13.949
There is simply not time to talk.
The gendarmes are on the way,

01:54:14.024 --> 01:54:16.549
apparently, so hurry up
and pack something.

01:54:16.627 --> 01:54:19.118
I'm not going
with you, Fernand.

01:54:28.038 --> 01:54:31.201
[Panting]
You are my wife.

01:54:31.275 --> 01:54:34.267
I have made
arrangements for us.

01:54:34.345 --> 01:54:37.337
We shall be very well
taken care of.

01:54:37.414 --> 01:54:40.542
Now go and find my son.

01:54:40.618 --> 01:54:44.054
- He's not your son.
- I beg your pardon?

01:54:44.121 --> 01:54:48.956
Albert Mondego is the son
of Edmond Dantes.

01:54:53.531 --> 01:54:58.764
Why do you think I rushed off
so quickly to marry you
after Edmond was taken away?

01:55:07.845 --> 01:55:11.679
Premature.

01:55:28.566 --> 01:55:31.831
Well, aren't you
a piece of work.

01:55:31.902 --> 01:55:36.965
So he's the bastard son
of a dead traitor.

01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:39.009
He always was disappointing.

01:55:51.689 --> 01:55:56.558
Good-bye, Mercedes.
You did please me some of the time.

01:56:00.898 --> 01:56:04.493
You never pleased me.

01:56:21.886 --> 01:56:24.878
[Whinnies]

01:56:54.852 --> 01:56:57.184
[Whispering]
What is this?

01:57:05.996 --> 01:57:07.930
[Clattering]

01:57:11.302 --> 01:57:13.634
Monte Cristo.

01:57:16.874 --> 01:57:19.434
King's to you, Fernand.

01:57:27.117 --> 01:57:30.109
[Panting]
Edmond?

01:57:31.889 --> 01:57:34.119
But how...

01:57:34.191 --> 01:57:38.685
How did I escape?
With difficulty.

01:57:38.762 --> 01:57:43.631
How did I plan this moment?
With pleasure.

01:57:43.701 --> 01:57:46.932
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- So you've taken Mercedes?

01:57:47.004 --> 01:57:49.404
And everything else...

01:57:49.473 --> 01:57:51.441
except your life.

01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:55.669
Why are you doing this?

01:57:55.746 --> 01:57:58.408
It's complicated.

01:57:59.883 --> 01:58:04.149
Let's just say it's vengeance
for the life you stole from me.

01:58:14.565 --> 01:58:17.432
Well, I see someone
has taught you the sword.

01:58:17.501 --> 01:58:20.368
How did you ever
call yourself my friend?

01:58:20.437 --> 01:58:23.804
- We were friends, Edmond.
- [Yells]

01:58:23.874 --> 01:58:26.638
You sent me to hell!

01:58:26.710 --> 01:58:28.678
Why?

01:58:30.347 --> 01:58:32.907
Take your vengeance.
[Panting]

01:58:32.983 --> 01:58:35.679
But know the blood
you spill is noble.

01:58:37.621 --> 01:58:39.612
Blood that will never
run through your veins.

01:58:39.690 --> 01:58:41.681
You're no more a count
than I am a commoner!

01:58:45.295 --> 01:58:47.525
[Grunting]

01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:52.864
You don't have it in you.

01:58:58.442 --> 01:59:02.139
- Touch him, and I'll kill you.
- Boy, let me explain.

01:59:02.212 --> 01:59:05.909
It's been explained.
I spoke to Madame Villefort
on the street.

01:59:05.983 --> 01:59:08.713
She told me how I was a silly,
trusting dupe that my friend,

01:59:08.786 --> 01:59:11.254
the Count of Monte Cristo,
used to get into our lives.

01:59:11.321 --> 01:59:13.255
- Albert, listen to me.
- I will not!

01:59:13.323 --> 01:59:16.451
Forgive me for being
such a fool, Father.

01:59:16.527 --> 01:59:18.586
You were betrayed.
Of course you're forgiven.

01:59:18.662 --> 01:59:20.823
You were my friend.
I looked up to you.

01:59:20.898 --> 01:59:22.889
There's a history here
you know nothing about.

01:59:22.966 --> 01:59:25.833
He loved your mother,
and yet she chose me.

01:59:25.903 --> 01:59:28.371
- Now he intends to steal her away.
- Lie. Get out of my way!

01:59:31.442 --> 01:59:34.878
Boy, if I have to,
I will kill you.

01:59:34.945 --> 01:59:37.106
I will not stop now.

01:59:37.181 --> 01:59:39.945
- Nor will I.
- So be it.

01:59:40.017 --> 01:59:42.212
[Mercedes Shouting]
No!

01:59:51.495 --> 01:59:52.757
[Clicks]

01:59:59.703 --> 02:00:03.366
Albert,

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:07.274
I found the note you left
explaining where you'd gone.

02:00:07.344 --> 02:00:12.509
But now I must
explain something to you.

02:00:12.583 --> 02:00:15.245
Where you really come from.

02:00:15.319 --> 02:00:19.380
Albert, you are
the son of Edmond Dantes.

02:00:25.996 --> 02:00:29.159
The man you know as
the Count of Monte Cristo.

02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:45.505
Well, I'm afraid
it is true.

02:00:45.582 --> 02:00:49.074
You are the walking proof
that your mother
was as much of a whore...

02:00:49.153 --> 02:00:51.644
in her younger years
as she is today.

02:00:51.722 --> 02:00:53.849
[Albert]
You...

02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:59.085
You let me fight him?

02:00:59.163 --> 02:01:01.961
It didn't do
any good though, did it?

02:01:02.032 --> 02:01:04.660
Fernand, I beg you.
No more!

02:01:04.735 --> 02:01:06.669
I want no more of this.

02:01:08.038 --> 02:01:12.702
Just go.
Call it mercy.

02:01:12.776 --> 02:01:14.767
Mercy, Fernand.

02:01:21.051 --> 02:01:26.387
You've only got one shot,
and it will take
more than that to stop me.

02:01:26.456 --> 02:01:30.051
Well, then I'd best
put it where it will do
the most damage.

02:01:31.728 --> 02:01:34.026
[Albert]
No!

02:01:34.097 --> 02:01:36.565
Mother! Mother!

02:01:36.633 --> 02:01:40.330
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look what I've done. Jacopo!

02:01:44.074 --> 02:01:45.974
Hyah!

02:01:50.814 --> 02:01:52.873
Once again, Zatarra,

02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:55.282
God sees you out of
the corner of His eye.

02:01:55.352 --> 02:01:57.286
She'll live.

02:02:02.226 --> 02:02:03.659
[Whinnies]

02:02:30.287 --> 02:02:32.755
- [Fernand] Edmond!
- [Whimpers]

02:02:32.823 --> 02:02:35.849
Edmond!

02:02:35.926 --> 02:02:39.692
Please don't go
out there. Don't.

02:02:39.763 --> 02:02:41.856
Edmond, don't go.

02:02:41.932 --> 02:02:45.527
You try.
Don't ever quit.

02:02:45.602 --> 02:02:48.070
Zatarra,

02:02:48.138 --> 02:02:51.266
you must end this.

02:02:52.943 --> 02:02:56.401
Even the priest
will understand that.

02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.576
- Edmond!
- [Mercedes Whispering]
Please don't leave.

02:03:02.853 --> 02:03:05.617
Watch over your mother.

02:03:25.309 --> 02:03:30.611
Now, I couldn't live in a world
where you have everything
and I have nothing.

02:04:53.163 --> 02:04:54.824
[Groans]

02:05:11.448 --> 02:05:14.110
What happened
to your mercy?

02:05:14.184 --> 02:05:19.087
I'm a count,
not a saint.

02:05:19.156 --> 02:05:22.819
[Panting]

02:05:59.763 --> 02:06:04.257
You were right, priest.
You were right.

02:06:05.969 --> 02:06:08.335
This I promise you...

02:06:08.405 --> 02:06:12.774
and God:

02:06:12.843 --> 02:06:16.006
All that was used
for vengeance...

02:06:16.079 --> 02:06:20.345
will now be used for good.

02:06:20.417 --> 02:06:24.649
So rest in peace, my friend.

02:06:24.721 --> 02:06:27.952
So, Zatarra,

02:06:28.024 --> 02:06:30.185
painful, huh?

02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:33.093
No.

02:06:38.568 --> 02:06:43.733
I bought this place,
thinking one day
I would tear it down.

02:06:43.807 --> 02:06:46.469
But now the only things
I care about...

02:06:46.543 --> 02:06:50.980
are walking off
this island with me.

02:06:51.047 --> 02:06:53.880
Let's go home.
