WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.868
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.988 --> 00:05.411
- Please come home, AJ.
- I can't do that to Ty.

00:05.531 --> 00:07.133
Mom, I'm just afraid that
if he stays with his brother,

00:07.253 --> 00:09.079
he's gonna get in some real trouble.

00:09.199 --> 00:11.114
AJ, we're arresting your
brother because he was involved

00:11.234 --> 00:13.116
in a hit-and-run that
injured Mariana and Jesus,

00:13.236 --> 00:15.171
but we're gonna have to
take you in for running away.

00:15.291 --> 00:19.122
- I'm here to see AJ Hensdale.
- You're not on his list.

00:19.242 --> 00:20.776
It's open auditions, right?

00:20.896 --> 00:22.585
All right, but aren't
you gonna be too busy

00:22.705 --> 00:24.305
with junior class
president and all that?

00:24.399 --> 00:26.382
I lost. Lexi won.

00:26.502 --> 00:28.139
I'm Jesus, your son.

00:28.259 --> 00:29.784
- You gotta leave.
- Why?

00:29.904 --> 00:33.355
I can't... legally be around you.

00:33.656 --> 00:37.684
_

00:37.804 --> 00:40.177
Do you know about privatized homes?

00:40.297 --> 00:42.112
If there's something
we could do about that?

00:42.232 --> 00:44.899
The most important thing for us to do
right now is to look at the big picture.

00:45.019 --> 00:47.269
We're doing a skin-sparing mastectomy.

00:47.389 --> 00:50.092
- How can I help?
- I'm scared.

00:52.068 --> 00:54.823
<i>35% of foster kids will be incarcerated</i>

00:54.943 --> 00:57.886
<i>at some point before they reach age 18.</i>

00:58.006 --> 01:00.615
<i>66% of foster kids who age out</i>

01:00.735 --> 01:03.619
<i>will end up either
homeless, in jail, or dead</i>

01:03.739 --> 01:05.788
<i>with in one year.</i>

01:05.908 --> 01:10.311
<i>How could we expect otherwise
when this is how we care for them?</i>

01:13.075 --> 01:15.142
I was one of the lucky ones.

01:15.262 --> 01:17.147
After seven different foster placements,

01:17.267 --> 01:20.232
I finally found a home... and a family.

01:20.352 --> 01:22.185
But, as someone who barely survived it,

01:22.305 --> 01:25.792
I can tell you the
system is severely broken.

01:25.912 --> 01:28.125
Help kids like me find
the homes they deserve.

01:28.245 --> 01:31.503
<i>Support SB-3301.</i>

01:33.709 --> 01:37.610
- So, what do you think?
- Well, it's very, very powerful.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.851
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we think so.

01:39.971 --> 01:43.027
I guess we just didn't realize
that Callie would be supporting

01:43.147 --> 01:47.276
- some new piece of legislation.
- I'm sorry. I assumed you knew.

01:47.396 --> 01:49.825
We're trying to make
some real change here.

01:49.945 --> 01:51.884
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, and the statehouse

01:52.004 --> 01:54.404
- is where that happens.
- Right. That's a good thing, right?

01:54.471 --> 01:55.825
We're not saying that it's not, but...

01:55.945 --> 01:59.308
It's just that you're endorsing
a bill that we know nothing about, Cal.

01:59.428 --> 02:01.102
Have you read it?

02:02.198 --> 02:03.876
- No, not like word for word...
- Okay.

02:03.996 --> 02:08.011
But I know that it's trying to reform
the system, and I trust Justina.

02:08.131 --> 02:10.066
Well, we certainly
don't mean to suggest...

02:10.186 --> 02:13.833
- But you kind of are.
- You know what, Callie?

02:13.953 --> 02:16.662
Your moms are absolutely
right. You should all read it.

02:16.782 --> 02:18.418
- I'll get you a copy as soon as I can.
- Thank you.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.556
That would be great. Appreciate it.

02:23.064 --> 02:26.121
You know, there is something I've
been waiting to tell you, Callie.

02:26.241 --> 02:29.533
Apparently, the work we've been doing
has been getting a lot of attention,

02:29.653 --> 02:34.127
and... we have been invited
to the White House next month.

02:34.247 --> 02:35.959
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

02:36.079 --> 02:38.422
Yeah, they're having a
symposium on foster care,

02:38.542 --> 02:40.917
and they want us to be there.

02:41.037 --> 02:43.620
Wow. That's amazing.

02:43.740 --> 02:45.287
Of course, we need to
look at the calendar...

02:45.322 --> 02:47.436
Callie's school work and all that.

02:47.556 --> 02:49.241
Of course.

02:50.818 --> 02:53.396
Okay, I'm gonna go and I'll
talk to you later, Callie.

02:53.516 --> 02:56.457
- I'll let myself out.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

02:58.624 --> 03:00.432
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

03:00.552 --> 03:03.370
Take it easy. It's not been
that long since surgery.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.244
What is wrong with you guys?

03:07.364 --> 03:09.748
- Excuse me?
- It's the White House.

03:09.868 --> 03:12.010
Yes. It is a great opportunity, Callie,

03:12.130 --> 03:14.125
- and hopefully you can go.
- Hopefully?

03:14.245 --> 03:16.593
You have a lot on your
plate already, honey.

03:16.713 --> 03:18.656
We can't let Fost and
Found and all of this

03:18.776 --> 03:20.237
distract you from your school work.

03:20.357 --> 03:22.468
- It's not.
- What about your senior project?

03:22.588 --> 03:24.299
You still haven't even
declared what you're doing.

03:24.419 --> 03:26.841
I have it figured out.
I'm gonna talk to Rita tomorrow.

03:26.961 --> 03:29.452
- Okay, good.
- So, what's the problem?

03:29.572 --> 03:32.115
Callie, we really
don't know Justina at all.

03:32.235 --> 03:34.545
But I do, and she's doing a lot for me.

03:34.665 --> 03:36.921
And why are you always
so suspicious of everyone?

03:37.041 --> 03:39.852
No, hold on. Wanting to read the bill

03:39.972 --> 03:42.757
that you are being used to support

03:42.877 --> 03:45.721
is not being suspicious,
Callie, it's being smart.

03:45.841 --> 03:47.842
I'll get it.

03:47.962 --> 03:51.083
Oh, unless you guys are
afraid it's home invasion.

03:54.745 --> 03:56.473
Hey, Callie.

03:57.865 --> 03:59.550
Hey.

04:41.918 --> 04:45.293
I just want you guys to know how
bad I feel about what happened.

04:45.413 --> 04:48.965
Look, I know my brother
did a terrible thing...

04:49.085 --> 04:51.831
and then we just took
off after all the...

04:54.768 --> 04:56.834
You're doing great.

05:01.413 --> 05:05.241
After all the nice stuff
you guys did for me...

05:05.361 --> 05:07.924
I should've made Ty turn
himself in, but I was just...

05:08.044 --> 05:11.000
I was afraid I wasn't
gonna see him again.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.475
So, anyway...

05:14.595 --> 05:16.557
I'm sorry.

05:16.677 --> 05:18.633
We get it, AJ.

05:18.888 --> 05:20.716
Family is everything.

05:21.344 --> 05:23.907
It's good of you to come here

05:24.241 --> 05:27.102
and say all of that, AJ. Thank you.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.904
Yeah. Good job.

05:32.096 --> 05:34.035
I'll wait outside.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.836
Hey, you got a sec?

05:46.349 --> 05:49.257
I just... wanna know how you are doing.

05:50.102 --> 05:52.916
Well, for 10 days since the surgery,
I'm doing pretty well.

06:01.252 --> 06:04.925
- That was really brave.
- Which part?

06:05.045 --> 06:08.516
Me running away or missing
my grandma's funeral?

06:09.025 --> 06:12.283
- No, I meant...
- I know what you meant, Callie.

06:14.946 --> 06:18.551
Did they tell you I tried
to come see you in juvie?

06:18.671 --> 06:20.394
Like, a few times?

06:20.514 --> 06:22.318
<i>A(TM)? When I see you a(TM)?</i>

06:22.438 --> 06:25.182
I had no idea what your brother had done

06:25.302 --> 06:27.665
when I told Stef where you were.

06:27.785 --> 06:31.334
I swear to you. And
as soon as I found out, I called you.

06:34.384 --> 06:36.125
Have you heard from Ty?

06:36.245 --> 06:39.167
- I got a letter from him.
- That's good.

06:40.146 --> 06:42.085
Is he okay?

06:44.135 --> 06:46.062
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

06:55.338 --> 06:58.987
Yeah. It's killing me, though. Too slow.

06:59.343 --> 07:03.540
Things have been drying up for me.
You guys been keeping busy?

07:03.660 --> 07:06.044
- You want one, right?
- Hey.

07:08.827 --> 07:11.147
Later.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.427
I told you...
Stay away from me.

07:18.547 --> 07:22.756
I know you did, and I know why, too.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.817
I know what you are. You're disgusting.

07:27.303 --> 07:29.830
Then what are you doing here?

07:30.419 --> 07:32.421
I don't want it.

07:33.243 --> 07:35.856
I don't want anything from you.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.145
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.025
There you are. I haven't
seen you in forever.

07:55.125 --> 07:58.048
Yeah, I know. I've just
been so busy, you know?

07:58.168 --> 08:03.528
Tell me about it. This whole student
government thing is a lot of work.

08:06.723 --> 08:09.552
Okay. I've gotta get to class.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.932
Hey. How's your mom?

08:20.052 --> 08:22.023
A lot better. Thanks for asking.

08:22.143 --> 08:25.537
You're welcome. So, does that mean
I get to take you out now, or...

08:25.657 --> 08:29.120
You are really gunning
for those french fries, aren't you?

08:29.240 --> 08:31.880
Oh, no. No, no, no, 'cause you
kept me waiting for two weeks,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.188
you owe me french fries plus interest.

08:34.308 --> 08:37.024
Yeah, it's a full-on date
now... All four food groups.

08:37.144 --> 08:39.636
Fine.

08:39.756 --> 08:41.634
Sweet.

08:41.754 --> 08:45.024
Hey, where is Jesus? Is
he sick today or something?

08:45.144 --> 08:50.120
So, for the Student Council's
Community Outreach Project this year,

08:50.240 --> 08:53.165
here's what I was thinking.

08:53.285 --> 08:55.801
I thought if we take
this space in City Heights

08:55.921 --> 08:58.935
and turn it into a park
or a community garden,

08:59.055 --> 09:02.422
- It's very impressive.
- And I was thinking,

09:02.542 --> 09:07.182
if I design the gardens
and oversee the execution,

09:07.302 --> 09:10.482
it could also be my senior thesis.

09:10.602 --> 09:13.708
- Yeah, I don't see why not.
- Uh, actually...

09:13.828 --> 09:16.721
since the school funds
the outreach program,

09:16.841 --> 09:20.239
it could be perceived that we
are also funding your thesis,

09:20.359 --> 09:22.649
which is against the rules.

09:23.221 --> 09:24.329
Oh.

09:25.484 --> 09:27.182
Yeah, that makes sense.

09:27.302 --> 09:30.301
Yeah, I'll just... I'll
think of something else.

09:30.421 --> 09:33.209
What if she got the materials donated?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.972
Yeah. I guess that could work.

09:38.092 --> 09:40.905
Yeah, I bet if you show the
local nurseries what we just saw,

09:41.025 --> 09:43.887
- they'll be lining up to help.
- Thank you.

09:44.007 --> 09:46.299
- Wow. That's... that's a great idea.
- Yeah.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.081
I'll try. Thank you.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.953
She's an incredible
young woman, isn't she?

09:55.073 --> 09:57.035
Yeah, she is.

10:04.290 --> 10:07.149
- Where did you go this morning?
- What?

10:07.269 --> 10:09.347
You missed first period.
Where were you?

10:09.467 --> 10:11.320
It's none of your business.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.745
Fine. I'll tell Mama.

10:15.069 --> 10:17.294
Hey!

10:18.970 --> 10:21.795
I went to give Gabe his tool belt back.

10:21.915 --> 10:24.283
What? Why?

10:27.398 --> 10:29.957
Because I didn't want it anymore.

10:30.077 --> 10:32.246
So... why not throw it away?

10:32.366 --> 10:35.053
Because I wanted to tell
him that we know what he did.

10:35.173 --> 10:38.716
- Who cares?
- I do! All right? I care.

10:44.779 --> 10:46.677
You want a to write a paper about me?

10:46.797 --> 10:48.956
Yeah, for my senior thesis.

10:49.076 --> 10:50.954
Well, what about me?

10:51.074 --> 10:54.412
I don't know, like, how
good you are at your job,

10:54.532 --> 10:57.382
and everything you do here at GU.

10:57.502 --> 11:02.172
I haven't really figured it out yet,
but you're like my mentor.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.645
Plus my moms are all
over me to pick something,

11:05.765 --> 11:07.666
so I told them I was gonna do this.

11:07.786 --> 11:11.277
Well, I'm very honored.
I'm sure we could work something out.

11:11.397 --> 11:14.886
So, you know what? I was looking at
the new and improved Fost and Found app,

11:15.006 --> 11:17.557
- It looks really great.
- Yeah, I know, right?

11:17.677 --> 11:21.613
And it looks... so real and important.

11:21.733 --> 11:23.892
Yeah, it's impressive.

11:24.824 --> 11:27.908
I... I got invited to the White House.

11:28.028 --> 11:30.876
What?
For the foster care symposium?

11:30.996 --> 11:33.406
Yeah. I mean, if my moms let me go.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.708
Oh, come on, why
wouldn't they let you go?

11:35.828 --> 11:38.377
I guess they're not too excited

11:38.497 --> 11:40.799
about the work I've
been doing with Justina.

11:40.919 --> 11:43.019
Why not? What's going on?

11:43.959 --> 11:47.122
She's been working on
this foster reform bill.

11:47.242 --> 11:48.740
Oh. She's the one behind that.

11:48.860 --> 11:52.007
Yeah. Stef got really
weird and suspicious

11:52.127 --> 11:54.746
and said she wanted to
read the whole thing.

11:54.866 --> 11:58.151
No, you know, honey, they're just
being your moms. That's their job.

11:58.271 --> 12:00.473
You know they're really
proud of you, right?

12:00.593 --> 12:02.277
I guess. They're so annoying.

12:02.397 --> 12:04.787
What?

12:04.907 --> 12:07.506
It's funny to hear you
sound like a normal teenager.

12:07.626 --> 12:10.476
Shut up. How's
that for a normal teenager?

12:10.596 --> 12:12.171
- Sure, that's good too.
- Mmm.

12:12.291 --> 12:15.727
- So, have you read it, the bill?
- No. No, she hasn't sent it over yet.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.771
- I did.
- How'd you get it?

12:17.891 --> 12:19.710
I'm very connected.

12:19.830 --> 12:22.584
- It's my business. It wasn't hard.
- And?

12:22.704 --> 12:24.627
There's some good things in it.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.660
- Uh-huh.
- But it does allocate

12:27.780 --> 12:32.440
over 50% of the state foster
care budget to privatized homes.

12:33.258 --> 12:35.635
What? No. Okay, that
doesn't make any sense,

12:35.755 --> 12:37.637
'cause Justina's against privatization.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.246
Not if she supports
this bill, she isn't.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.403
- Hey.
- Hey, stranger.

12:52.045 --> 12:53.519
Long time, no see.

12:53.639 --> 12:57.139
Guessing my kid's car seat
really scared you off, huh?

12:57.259 --> 12:59.492
Actually, my mom had surgery,

12:59.612 --> 13:02.480
so I had to take some time off.

13:02.739 --> 13:05.521
Oh. Sorry.

13:06.013 --> 13:08.016
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

13:09.070 --> 13:11.009
Good.

13:11.614 --> 13:16.709
Well, it's probably a good thing that
we got to... put the brakes on things.

13:16.829 --> 13:20.523
You're too young to be dating
a woman with a kid, right?

13:20.643 --> 13:22.741
Don't tell me what I think.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.901
And the big highlight of my day
was being shown up by my boss

13:27.021 --> 13:30.223
in front of the student body
president. That was great.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.361
Is everything okay?

13:32.759 --> 13:36.971
Yeah. Yeah, it's just,
you know, frustrating.

13:39.076 --> 13:42.906
Hey, so... I'm kind
of worried about Jesus.

13:43.026 --> 13:45.028
What? What? Why?

13:45.524 --> 13:49.232
Well, he found our birth dad.

13:51.248 --> 13:55.052
- Jesus! Get in here, please.
- But that's not all.

13:55.172 --> 13:57.334
The guy's a sex offender.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.542
I was looking hip up online,

14:06.662 --> 14:08.949
and he's on the sex
offender registry thingee.

14:09.069 --> 14:11.281
Look, I only worked
with him for a few days.

14:11.401 --> 14:14.217
- You worked with him, Jesus?
- Stef, calm down.

14:14.337 --> 14:16.722
I didn't tell them that part.

14:16.842 --> 14:19.751
No, no, wait. Okay, listen
to me, the two of you.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.997
You are never to go near this man again.

14:23.117 --> 14:26.255
Do you hear me? All right? You have
no idea who you are dealing with.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.450
He could be very, very dangerous,
and this is not me overreacting.

14:29.570 --> 14:32.331
This is not me giving you a parental
warning that you can just ignore,

14:32.343 --> 14:33.858
because you think that
I'm being ridiculous.

14:33.978 --> 14:36.941
This could be very
serious. You understand me?

14:37.061 --> 14:39.721
- No, no, I want to hear you say "yes."
- Yes.

14:39.841 --> 14:42.017
- Yes.
- Yes, thank you.

14:45.256 --> 14:48.415
Hey, man.

14:49.649 --> 14:51.642
I... I wasn't gonna say anything,

14:51.762 --> 14:53.421
'cause it seemed like it was
never actually gonna happen,

14:53.541 --> 14:55.791
but I'm taking your sister out tonight.

14:55.911 --> 14:58.950
- What? Who? Callie?
- No, your twin sister.

14:59.070 --> 15:01.019
No. No, no, no, that's...
that's impossible,

15:01.139 --> 15:04.384
see, 'cause we have this "no
dating each other's friends" policy

15:04.504 --> 15:07.647
- that she made.
- Well, I guess she's in violation.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.373
Yeah. I guess she is.

15:11.825 --> 15:14.159
Cool. Hey, look, now that
the cat's out of the bag,

15:14.279 --> 15:15.953
I could use some advice.

15:16.073 --> 15:20.382
I wanna, you know, impress her,
so tell me, what should I do?

15:22.254 --> 15:23.970
I got just the thing.

15:31.072 --> 15:33.329
Ooh! You look great.

15:34.398 --> 15:37.604
Thank you. I want you to meet my moms.

15:37.724 --> 15:39.109
- Hey.
- Uh, hey.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.285
- This is Nick.
- Hello.

15:41.405 --> 15:44.839
- Hi, nice to see you again.
- Oh! Is that your Challenger out there?

15:44.959 --> 15:48.575
- It is, yeah.
- Oh. You know I'm a cop, yeah?

15:48.695 --> 15:50.699
- Well, actually, it's not...
- And I know pretty much all of the cops

15:50.819 --> 15:54.057
in town, and if you go two miles over
the speed limit, I will hear about it.

15:54.177 --> 15:56.941
And after I impound your car, you will
never see my beautiful daughter again.

15:57.061 --> 15:59.422
- She's kidding.
- No.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.107
So, where... where are
you guys headed tonight?

16:02.227 --> 16:04.998
Oh, we're just gonna grab
a burger, you know?

16:05.118 --> 16:08.045
Come on, we're gonna
be late to pick up Lexi.

16:08.165 --> 16:10.174
Oh, a double date. That sounds good.

16:20.635 --> 16:23.935
* You caught his eye, Surf Girl *

16:24.055 --> 16:27.389
* I wonder why, Surf Girl *

16:27.509 --> 16:30.875
* You won't try, Surf Girl *

16:30.995 --> 16:33.411
* To see him *

16:33.531 --> 16:36.948
 He's high and dry, Surf Girl *

16:37.068 --> 16:40.259
* It makes me cry, Surf Girl *

16:40.379 --> 16:43.516
* Just please reply, Surf Girl *

16:43.636 --> 16:45.839
* With "yes" *

16:45.959 --> 16:50.214
* To him *

16:54.558 --> 16:56.990
Thank you, thank you.

17:00.431 --> 17:03.174
- So?
- I told you.

17:03.294 --> 17:06.726
- Going out with me is not a good idea.
- Give me one reason why not.

17:06.846 --> 17:10.214
Among other things, I
just don't have the time.

17:10.335 --> 17:13.339
Well, what if I... found you the time?

17:14.244 --> 17:16.921
That makes even less sense
than the song you just made up.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.761
Well, you
didn't answer the question.

17:23.948 --> 17:27.731
- Thanks for coming over.
- Of course.

17:27.851 --> 17:31.159
You sounded upset on the phone,
so what's going on?

17:31.279 --> 17:34.666
- I read the bill.
- Okay.

17:34.786 --> 17:38.548
And it's totally pro-privatization.

17:38.668 --> 17:42.383
No. I mean, well, that's part of it,
sure, but it's a comprehensive...

17:42.503 --> 17:45.168
No, no, please don't talk
to me like I'm stupid.

17:45.288 --> 17:47.544
You know how I feel
about privatized homes.

17:47.664 --> 17:51.362
My friend Kiara was almost
killed in one of these places.

17:51.482 --> 17:53.321
Callie, I don't mean
to talk down to you,

17:53.441 --> 17:56.367
but I would appreciate
a chance to explain.

17:56.487 --> 17:58.530
I think I've earned
that right, don't you?

17:58.650 --> 18:00.796
After all I've done to help you?

18:02.640 --> 18:06.905
As part... of more comprehensive reform,

18:07.025 --> 18:09.102
privatization is incredibly effective.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.065
By taking the money out of
the hands of bureaucrats,

18:11.185 --> 18:13.153
and spending it directly
on the kids who need help

18:13.273 --> 18:14.616
and the families who are helping them,

18:14.736 --> 18:16.505
we can get so much more done.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.816
If all the money isn't
going to the kids,

18:18.936 --> 18:21.605
the companies doing the
placement are making a profit.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.475
Well, why shouldn't they make
a profit when they're providing

18:23.595 --> 18:26.924
a superior service and
taking big risks to do it?

18:27.044 --> 18:29.179
Think about it. When something
bad happens in a privatized home,

18:29.299 --> 18:31.766
who's responsible? The company, the CEO.

18:31.886 --> 18:33.464
Right now, if something goes wrong,

18:33.584 --> 18:36.532
everyone in the system just passes
the buck, and nothing ever changes.

18:36.652 --> 18:41.162
- This all just blows up the system.
- Yeah, because it needs to be blown up.

18:43.961 --> 18:45.810
All right, think about it.

18:45.930 --> 18:50.165
Your school, Anchor Beach...
It's a charter school, right?

18:50.285 --> 18:52.217
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they're taking government money

18:52.337 --> 18:54.852
out of the system, and they're
using it to create a better,

18:54.972 --> 18:58.658
more responsive, more creative
education for you, right?

18:58.778 --> 19:02.310
Yeah, well, then that's what
we're doing with foster care.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.530
Doesn't that make sense?

19:09.513 --> 19:11.953
So, Lexi...

19:12.073 --> 19:13.741
what's it like being class president?

19:13.861 --> 19:16.912
I mean, you're the most popular
girl in school now, right?

19:17.032 --> 19:19.828
Oh. Not really.

19:19.948 --> 19:21.931
But it's cool.

19:22.051 --> 19:25.039
It's a lot of work, but...

19:25.505 --> 19:27.641
I kind of love it.

19:27.761 --> 19:29.366
Well, I bet you're really good at it.

19:29.486 --> 19:33.314
I mean, I can't think of anyone
who could do a better job than you.

19:33.434 --> 19:36.152
I mean, can you, Mariana?

19:37.183 --> 19:40.568
No, she's... she's pretty awesome.

19:41.866 --> 19:44.743
Let's go see what's on the jukebox.

19:47.384 --> 19:49.721
- After you.
-  Please.

19:51.622 --> 19:54.716
I'm sorry. Jesus said this
was your favorite place.

19:54.836 --> 19:57.251
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Oh god.

19:57.371 --> 20:00.722
- I think it's called "payback."
-  Yeah.

20:00.842 --> 20:03.877
So, what's your deal? Are you
even happy to be out with me

20:03.997 --> 20:07.086
or is this just some master
plan to annoy your sister?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.849
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

20:09.183 --> 20:12.219
I...

20:12.798 --> 20:14.843
I'm sorry.

20:15.145 --> 20:18.927
Okay, I am stoked to
be out with you. Really.

20:19.879 --> 20:21.706
You sure?

20:29.474 --> 20:31.540
I promise.

20:34.463 --> 20:36.263
Orders are up.

20:36.383 --> 20:37.825
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.988
Here you go. Enjoy.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.143
You're not... really
gonna eat that, are you?

20:43.263 --> 20:45.374
What, my monster burger? Please, woman.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.955
- I had my first one when I was six.
- No way. For real?

20:49.075 --> 20:50.738
I wanted to order it,
but my dad said if I did,

20:50.858 --> 20:52.707
I had to eat the whole thing, so...

20:52.827 --> 20:56.778
- So you did? You were six.
- Yeah. I threw up a couple of times.

20:56.898 --> 21:01.201
My dad told me we weren't leaving
until I finished the last bite, so...

21:01.321 --> 21:06.386
Maybe I shouldn't say this, but that
kinda makes your dad sound like a jerk.

21:06.506 --> 21:08.620
You don't know the half of it.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.814
So, I was talking to Ty's lawyer
about his hearing tomorrow.

21:14.934 --> 21:19.355
And it turns out that he's not just
being charged with hit-and-run, but...

21:19.475 --> 21:21.807
he's also being charged
with grand theft auto.

21:21.927 --> 21:24.607
Well, the truck
belonged to Joe's father.

21:24.727 --> 21:27.645
I mean, unless Joe got his permission,

21:27.765 --> 21:30.845
- Ty technically stole the car.
-  Come on, Stef.

21:30.965 --> 21:34.399
We all know that Ty needs to face
charges for the crimes he did,

21:34.519 --> 21:36.274
but not for the crimes he didn't.

21:36.394 --> 21:38.146
He's looking at up to five years.

21:38.266 --> 21:40.446
Okay. What do you expect me to do, Mike?

21:40.566 --> 21:44.370
Well, I was hoping you
could speak on his behalf.

21:44.490 --> 21:45.860
What?

21:45.980 --> 21:49.697
Is that why you brought AJ
over to apologize the other day?

21:49.817 --> 21:51.989
- What?
- To soften me up to advocate for Ty?

21:52.109 --> 21:55.399
No. That was completely AJ's idea.

21:55.519 --> 21:58.673
Okay, look, this might help you
understand why Ty did what he did.

21:58.793 --> 22:01.659
If you could just... take a look at it.

22:02.874 --> 22:04.645
Thanks.

22:05.071 --> 22:06.533
Bye.

22:08.721 --> 22:12.679
I don't know exactly what
he's expecting me to do.

22:14.380 --> 22:16.653
I don't have control over this.

22:17.246 --> 22:19.678
You told me... When I first came here

22:19.798 --> 22:22.816
you told me that I wasn't disposable.

22:24.086 --> 22:26.077
So, why is Ty?

22:26.197 --> 22:27.887
Callie, it's complicated.

22:28.007 --> 22:31.048
No, it's... it's not. It's not, really.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.970
- Huh. What is this?
- It's a date.

22:45.701 --> 22:49.023
You said you'd go out with
me if you had the time.

22:49.143 --> 22:52.738
Well, you've got 15 minutes.

22:52.858 --> 22:55.048
Come on. It's like speed dating,

22:55.168 --> 22:59.210
and you know it's gonna beat that
granola bar you eat every night.

22:59.330 --> 23:01.460
Right?

23:05.989 --> 23:08.843
Well, at least they're out together.

23:08.963 --> 23:13.113
I'm not sure Mariana's too thrilled
about it, but it makes me feel better.

23:13.233 --> 23:15.835
- Do... do you want some help?
- No. I'm fine.

23:15.955 --> 23:19.806
- Good. How's it healing?
- It's... you know.

23:20.105 --> 23:24.711
It's okay. I can't feel
anything below my clavicle,

23:24.831 --> 23:26.913
Hopefully the numbness
will wear off soon.

23:27.033 --> 23:31.273
Yeah. Time will tell.

23:33.609 --> 23:35.689
- Oh, that's interesting.
- What?

23:37.029 --> 23:39.163
I had the guys down at the
station track down Gabe's record,

23:39.283 --> 23:41.166
and you're not gonna believe this.

23:43.664 --> 23:46.713
Oh, I think I'm gonna bust.

23:46.833 --> 23:50.452
Which is what happens
when you eat half a cow.

23:51.132 --> 23:53.071
Would you look at this guy?

23:55.839 --> 23:57.858
- Whoa.
- Hey, easy.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.946
What? This guy's going too slow.

24:04.414 --> 24:06.221
What's up, good looking?

24:07.967 --> 24:09.078
Idiot.

24:09.198 --> 24:12.807
You're not gonna let him
get away with that, are you?

24:12.927 --> 24:16.644
Come on, man, burn this fool.

24:16.764 --> 24:19.568
- What's going on?
- Nick.

24:19.688 --> 24:21.917
He can't touch you, bro.

24:32.464 --> 24:35.563
Oh my god! Oh my God! Stop the car!

24:35.683 --> 24:37.744
- Stop! Stop!
- What are you doing?

24:37.864 --> 24:40.851
- Slow down! Slow down!
- You're gonna get us killed!

24:40.971 --> 24:42.903
Come on, baby!

24:43.023 --> 24:46.422
Stop the car right
now! Pull the car over!

24:49.964 --> 24:51.931
Oh my God, you're gonna kill us!

24:52.051 --> 24:54.322
You're gonna run a red light!

24:56.047 --> 24:59.103
- Nice!
- You're gonna get us killed!

24:59.223 --> 25:01.841
Stop the car or I swear to God
I will never talk to you again.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.066
- Whoo!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

25:06.186 --> 25:08.026
Come on, we're just
having a little bit of fun.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.690
No, we could've been
in another accident.

25:09.784 --> 25:12.633
And after all our mom is
going through? You're an ass.

25:12.753 --> 25:17.218
- Hey, wait, come on. Mariana.
- Yeah. And for the record...

25:17.338 --> 25:21.073
- Not fun.
- What? Come on, nobody got hurt.

25:21.193 --> 25:22.993
Hey, look... all right,
look, I'm sorry, okay?

25:23.097 --> 25:24.345
Please, can you just
get back in the car?

25:24.465 --> 25:28.873
Screw you. You wanna kill
somebody, it ain't gonna be us.

25:31.348 --> 25:33.501
Well, that was very tasty.

25:33.621 --> 25:37.166
- Nobody ever makes me a meal.
-  Well, I didn't make it,

25:37.286 --> 25:39.892
but I'm glad you liked it.

25:41.304 --> 25:44.054
You deserve to be
taken care of sometimes.

25:50.538 --> 25:53.128
- Mommy!
- Hey.

25:53.862 --> 25:57.344
- What are you doing here?
- I've been texting you all night.

25:57.464 --> 25:59.835
I'm working.

25:59.955 --> 26:02.593
Yeah. No, I can see that.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.741
Brandon, this is Eddie, my...

26:06.861 --> 26:08.943
Mason's father.

26:09.063 --> 26:11.666
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Your bear.

26:11.786 --> 26:13.820
I got called into work early.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.761
- So?
- So, you gotta take Mason.

26:18.017 --> 26:20.135
Eddie, I can't just keep him
behind the bar.

26:20.255 --> 26:24.207
Why not? You got one kid here
already. You'll figure it out.

26:28.728 --> 26:31.819
Did you have a good
day? Huh? I missed you.

26:31.939 --> 26:33.756
My... my shift's over.

26:33.876 --> 26:36.130
I... I could watch him.

26:36.559 --> 26:38.466
Are you sure?

26:38.586 --> 26:39.833
Yeah.

26:41.441 --> 26:43.110
So...

26:43.872 --> 26:46.368
what's going on with your mom?

26:50.498 --> 26:53.314
She had a double mastectomy.

26:53.434 --> 26:56.944
Are you serious? Why didn't you tell me?

26:57.930 --> 26:59.742
I think...

27:00.527 --> 27:03.960
I guess I've just been
kind of avoiding you.

27:04.692 --> 27:06.408
It's not your fault.

27:07.105 --> 27:09.362
When you won the election...

27:09.482 --> 27:11.566
I mean, you weren't even here last year,

27:11.686 --> 27:15.754
and you're still more
popular than me, and I just...

27:16.231 --> 27:20.460
Whenever I hear how great you're doing,
it kind of makes me feel like a loser.

27:21.972 --> 27:24.129
If it makes you feel any better,

27:24.249 --> 27:26.610
student council is
seriously kicking my butt.

27:26.730 --> 27:30.295
It is so much work.

27:30.415 --> 27:34.422
It does make me feel
a little bit better.

27:34.706 --> 27:36.650
Thank you, buddy.

27:36.770 --> 27:40.447
I'm just gonna pick
this up now. That's fine.

27:40.567 --> 27:43.279
Oh no, no, no, no, hey, hey.
Yeah, we won't play with knives.

27:43.399 --> 27:45.709
- You know what's better than a knife?
- Cookies.

27:45.829 --> 27:48.203
A spoon. You want the spoon?

27:48.323 --> 27:50.238
Here you go. Don't put that in
your mouth. It was on the floor.

27:50.358 --> 27:53.241
Here you go. Spoons are
much better than knives.

27:53.361 --> 27:55.643
- Down!
- You don't want... you should try...

27:55.763 --> 27:59.325
This spoon's really fun. It's better than
the knife. It's better than the knife.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.515
- Mommy!
- Hey, wait, wait.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.626
Hey, bud!

28:04.505 --> 28:07.852
- It hasn't all been this bad. I promise.
- No, you did great.

28:07.972 --> 28:10.577
Oh. Here's your spoon.

28:10.697 --> 28:13.361
- Thanks.
- Well, they're letting me off early...

28:13.481 --> 28:16.464
I have to cut things, and knife...
cut knives, and cut things.

28:16.584 --> 28:18.500
- I'm gonna get him home.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

28:18.620 --> 28:20.520
There's a big old fire.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.323
- There you go.
- Thanks.

28:24.326 --> 28:27.060
Do you wanna say bye to
Brandon? Say, "Bye, Brandon."

28:27.180 --> 28:29.874
- Bye, Mason.
- Bye, Brandon.

28:29.994 --> 28:32.366
- Bye, Brandon.
- Thank you.

28:33.525 --> 28:35.226
Bye.

28:53.943 --> 28:56.922
- Wait!
- Hold on a sec.

28:57.367 --> 28:59.136
- Oh! Oh god.
- Forgot his...

28:59.256 --> 29:03.688
Oh my god, thank you.
He can't sleep without it.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.966
You just saved my life.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.314
Brandon.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.856
This is a bad idea.

29:25.599 --> 29:27.287
I've got lots of those.

29:38.185 --> 29:41.292
Mason, look who you forgot.

30:12.283 --> 30:16.584
The defendant, Mr. Hensdale,
is charged with felony hit-and-run,

30:16.704 --> 30:19.117
reckless driving,
driving without insurance,

30:19.237 --> 30:21.351
and grand theft auto.

30:21.923 --> 30:24.673
- Are you ready to enter a plea?
- We are, Your Honor.

30:24.793 --> 30:27.591
We plead guilty to all charges.

30:28.004 --> 30:30.916
In that case, we
will move on to sentencing.

30:36.333 --> 30:37.689
Can I help you?

30:37.809 --> 30:40.049
Yes, Your Honor. I am
Ms. Stefanie Adams Foster

30:40.169 --> 30:42.662
I am a parent of the youths
involved in the crash.

30:42.782 --> 30:46.188
I would like to offer a victim
impact statement if I may, please.

30:46.308 --> 30:48.311
- Approach.
- Thank you.

30:49.570 --> 30:53.145
Your Honor, as the victims' mother,

30:53.265 --> 30:56.510
I certainly would like
to see justice done,

30:56.630 --> 30:58.889
but as an officer
investigating the case,

30:59.009 --> 31:02.330
I feel that I also must
tell you that I am confident

31:02.450 --> 31:06.090
that Tyrone Hensdale did not steal
the truck that he was driving.

31:06.210 --> 31:07.557
Mr. Olson claimed otherwise.

31:07.677 --> 31:10.397
Joe Olson is afraid that he will
be charged with obstructing justice.

31:10.425 --> 31:12.345
Your Honor, I brought
along with me my case notes

31:12.393 --> 31:16.244
in the hope that you would
consider them before sentencing.

31:16.364 --> 31:18.378
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:21.337 --> 31:25.921
Your Honor, I do not feel that
this was a malicious crime.

31:26.041 --> 31:28.793
I believe that these were the
actions of a frightened young man.

31:28.913 --> 31:31.867
If I had had the experiences that
he had with the justice system,

31:31.987 --> 31:33.747
quite frankly, I would
be frightened too.

31:33.867 --> 31:38.721
Mr. Hensdale first entered into juvie
when he was arrested at the age of 11

31:38.841 --> 31:41.857
for throwing a rock into
an abandoned building.

31:41.977 --> 31:45.525
At the age of 14, he was
arrested for loitering.

31:45.645 --> 31:48.495
At 15, it was petty theft.
The list goes on from there.

31:48.615 --> 31:52.313
Tyrone Hensdale has just never
really been given a fair shake.

31:52.433 --> 31:56.604
While I am not prepared
to say that I forgive him,

31:57.129 --> 32:00.407
I most certainly do understand
why he did what he did.

32:00.527 --> 32:03.441
That is why I am asking
the court for lenience.

32:08.258 --> 32:10.425
Alright. Go on, tell her.

32:10.545 --> 32:14.448
Well, we got all the plants
and materials donated...

32:14.568 --> 32:17.048
- thanks to Monte.
- Why... why thanks to Monte?

32:17.168 --> 32:18.662
Because she came with me.

32:18.782 --> 32:20.741
Those guys at the garden
store had no chance

32:20.861 --> 32:23.455
once she started working
her magic on them.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.394
So, are we good?

32:26.514 --> 32:28.531
Can this be my thesis?

32:30.232 --> 32:34.135
- I don't see why not.
-  Yay.

32:34.255 --> 32:36.473
Okay. I'm off to class.

32:36.593 --> 32:40.813
Thank you so much for
everything. It's gonna be great.

32:43.212 --> 32:46.028
What's the problem now?

32:46.148 --> 32:51.627
Are you gonna dig the holes for her
too? This is totally inappropriate.

32:54.922 --> 32:56.972
Encouraging a promising student?

32:57.092 --> 32:58.941
Expanding our community outreach?

32:59.061 --> 33:02.219
No. Involving yourself
in a student's thesis.

33:02.339 --> 33:04.892
Sally can't be perceived as
getting special treatment, Monte.

33:05.012 --> 33:07.282
- There are rules th...
- Yes, of course there are.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.902
But sometimes, for the greater
good, we bend them a little.

33:11.022 --> 33:15.059
You didn't seem to mind when I bent
them to get your son back in school.

33:16.575 --> 33:19.595
Excuse me, I've got a conference call.

33:23.904 --> 33:26.101
I've conferred with the
DA, who has agreed to remove

33:26.221 --> 33:29.632
the charges of grand theft
auto against Mr. Hensdale.

33:29.752 --> 33:32.550
However, in light of the
defendant's previous record,

33:32.670 --> 33:36.174
I cannot let these additional
offenses go unpunished.

33:36.755 --> 33:38.757
I order the defendant, Tyrone Hensdale,

33:38.877 --> 33:42.480
remanded into custody
for a period of 18 months.

33:50.964 --> 33:53.635
Hey, I'm gonna be fine.

33:53.755 --> 33:55.637
I'll be out before you know it.

33:55.757 --> 33:57.686
Until then, you've got Mike, right?

33:57.806 --> 34:00.429
He's... he's gonna take care of you.

34:01.136 --> 34:03.075
Be good, okay?

34:10.728 --> 34:13.849
- Well, it's better than five years.
- It still kinda sucks.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.251
Thanks for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

34:16.371 --> 34:19.206
No, thank Callie. She's
the one that got me here.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.889
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:26.010 --> 34:29.998
Sorry I'm late, but the hearing
took longer than I thought.

34:30.118 --> 34:32.850
- How'd it go?
- He got 18 months.

34:32.969 --> 34:34.947
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

34:35.693 --> 34:39.041
Did you get to talk to Justina
about the bill? What'd she say?

34:39.161 --> 34:41.803
I did. She explained it to me,

34:41.922 --> 34:43.846
and I think...

34:44.199 --> 34:46.915
I gotta say, I think it makes sense.

34:47.034 --> 34:48.962
So, you're gonna support it?

34:49.540 --> 34:52.215
- That's too bad.
- What does that mean?

34:52.335 --> 34:53.851
Well, I just don't like

34:53.972 --> 34:56.594
seeing kids being sold
to the highest bidder.

34:56.715 --> 35:00.814
No, that's... that's
not what this is, Rita.

35:00.934 --> 35:05.837
Okay, so the system is broken,
right? We can agree on that?

35:05.957 --> 35:09.910
So, privatization is a way
for us to change things up.

35:10.030 --> 35:11.742
Yeah, a really dangerous way.

35:11.862 --> 35:14.011
I don't know why you think it's so bad.

35:14.131 --> 35:17.617
Okay, so something goes
wrong in a privatized home,

35:17.737 --> 35:19.333
who gets the blame? The CEO.

35:19.453 --> 35:22.833
That's a good thing. That means somebody's
finally gonna be held accountable.

35:22.953 --> 35:26.921
Are these your words or Justina's?
I mean, are you thinking these thoughts

35:27.041 --> 35:29.647
or just swallowing
whatever she feeds you?

35:29.767 --> 35:32.995
How come whenever I disagree with
something, everybody jumps all over me?

35:33.115 --> 35:35.075
Yeah, too bad. I'm sorry
you don't get it.

35:35.195 --> 35:36.910
I don't get it?

35:37.030 --> 35:40.606
Callie, I've been working in
the system for over 30 years.

35:40.726 --> 35:42.846
And let's be honest, Rita...
You have your own agenda.

35:42.872 --> 35:44.765
And what agenda is that, Callie?

35:44.885 --> 35:48.010
- Taking care of kids?
- No, keeping things the same

35:48.130 --> 35:51.630
- to protect your job.
- Wow. That's what you think of me?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.537
I think change is hard for people,

35:53.657 --> 35:56.515
especially when they
can't see the big picture.

35:57.590 --> 36:00.276
Say hello to the President for me.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.107
Hey, guys.

36:07.801 --> 36:12.253
- Hey, what... What are you doing here?
- Why don't you guys sit down, join us?

36:12.373 --> 36:15.036
We've asked Ana to come and talk
to you guys about your birth dad.

36:15.156 --> 36:17.105
- Look, I don't really wanna...
- Jesus, I think this is something

36:17.225 --> 36:21.276
you're gonna wanna hear, so
why don't you have a seat?

36:27.958 --> 36:33.520
So, your moms told me you found out
Gabe was on the sex offender registry...

36:33.902 --> 36:36.539
which was news to me.

36:36.659 --> 36:41.046
The reason he's on that list,
it's not because he was...

36:41.793 --> 36:43.965
He's on that list because of me.

36:44.085 --> 36:48.530
I... I was 15 when I met Gabe.

36:48.650 --> 36:51.734
He was 18. When my parents
found out about us...

36:51.854 --> 36:54.102
Well, let's just say
they didn't approve,

36:54.222 --> 36:59.691
because he was older and
they found out he sold drugs.

36:59.811 --> 37:02.303
So, they forbid me from seeing him,

37:02.423 --> 37:05.821
and then, of course, I
ran away to be with him.

37:05.941 --> 37:08.857
They called the police,
they busted down his door,

37:08.977 --> 37:11.212
and they arrested him for possession.

37:11.332 --> 37:15.998
He mostly just sold pot.
Well, not that that's okay, but...

37:16.118 --> 37:21.364
because I was underage, they also charged
him with unlawful sex with a minor,

37:21.484 --> 37:25.349
and that got him labeled a sex
offender and put on that list,

37:25.469 --> 37:27.630
which I never knew...

37:28.163 --> 37:29.879
until now.

37:30.552 --> 37:35.420
So, why do you always tell
us he was a one-night-stand?

37:35.540 --> 37:37.368
I guess...

37:38.139 --> 37:41.056
I didn't want you to think
you came from a junkie

37:41.176 --> 37:43.944
and... a drug dealer.

37:45.942 --> 37:48.914
I didn't want that to be your story.

38:01.382 --> 38:06.449
- Hey. What's going on?
- What do you mean?

38:06.569 --> 38:10.384
Since when do you turn
away to change your clothes?

38:17.550 --> 38:19.616
I guess I just...

38:21.110 --> 38:23.098
I don't wanna make
you feel uncomfortable.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.637
Okay. Why would I feel uncomfortable?

38:25.757 --> 38:28.443
'Cause of everything
you've been through.

38:34.808 --> 38:36.986
If I'm being honest...

38:38.734 --> 38:40.673
I feel a little guilty.

38:42.137 --> 38:46.336
Guilty... that my body is still intact.

38:46.972 --> 38:49.176
I just don't want to
make you feel worse.

38:49.296 --> 38:51.603
You're afraid I'm gonna feel... jealous?

38:51.723 --> 38:53.368
No.

38:56.566 --> 38:58.333
Sorry. It's really stupid.

38:58.453 --> 39:00.617
It's not, honey. No, it's okay.

39:00.737 --> 39:02.333
I'm okay.

39:03.352 --> 39:04.657
I am.

39:06.804 --> 39:09.029
Come sit here.

39:12.937 --> 39:17.371
I am starting to get...
some feeling back.

39:17.491 --> 39:20.975
Right, there you are. I
can feel you right there.

39:26.021 --> 39:28.061
For the record, you're not
what makes me feel worse.

39:28.102 --> 39:30.626
You're what makes me feel better. Okay?

39:41.851 --> 39:45.157
I just hope she can forgive
me for missing her funeral.

39:47.432 --> 39:49.880
You did it to be with Ty.

39:50.498 --> 39:52.930
I think she'd understand.

40:04.185 --> 40:09.138
- Do you forgive me for telling Stef?
- There's nothing to forgive, Callie.

40:10.035 --> 40:12.658
- You're not mad at me?
- Mm-hmm.

40:13.818 --> 40:16.710
Then why wouldn't you see
me when I came to juvie?

40:18.030 --> 40:20.223
I was embarrassed.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.462
Ashamed, you know, but not mad.

40:27.428 --> 40:29.663
We were just getting somewhere,
then I go and take off.

40:29.783 --> 40:31.646
I kind of figured I blew it.

40:44.397 --> 40:46.908
I guess not.

40:53.896 --> 40:58.651
Hey. Look, I want to
apologize for what I said.

40:59.017 --> 41:01.942
I... I was wrong.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.364
I didn't know you, but I do now.

41:05.484 --> 41:07.805
You don't have to do this.

41:11.326 --> 41:13.265
Come on, man, I'm trying to talk to you.

41:13.385 --> 41:14.635
Look...

41:14.755 --> 41:16.938
I don't know what you're looking for,

41:17.058 --> 41:18.540
but you're not gonna find
it with me, all right?

41:18.660 --> 41:21.958
I'm not your father,
and I never will be.
