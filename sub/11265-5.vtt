WEBVTT

00:02.452 --> 00:05.301
Which brings
us to our penultimate item,

00:05.302 --> 00:09.351
which concerns... yet
again, and to no great surprise...

00:09.352 --> 00:10.491
the restrooms.

00:10.492 --> 00:13.331
Specifically, the towel dispensers.

00:13.332 --> 00:14.972
Why'd you get the loopy, old-timey

00:14.997 --> 00:16.471
cloth kind in the first place?

00:16.472 --> 00:17.531
Because... Shut up.

00:17.532 --> 00:19.381
And I don't know who's doing it,

00:19.382 --> 00:21.351
and I doubt even God knows why,

00:21.352 --> 00:23.361
but my next step is to have

00:23.362 --> 00:25.421
the damn things swabbed for DNA!

00:27.392 --> 00:31.381
Seems like it'd be easier just
to take out the trash cans.

00:31.382 --> 00:32.944
Whoever's doing it, they obviously

00:32.969 --> 00:34.461
have to climb up on a trash can.

00:34.462 --> 00:36.381
'Cause it's like, up here, so...

00:36.382 --> 00:39.341
Wow. Name a handsome
Hollywood power lawyer

00:39.342 --> 00:40.247
who is having major second

00:40.272 --> 00:41.501
thoughts about hiring you people.

00:41.502 --> 00:45.341
- Mr. Shapiro!
- Boom! Square gets the square!

00:45.342 --> 00:47.411
And I get going. You guys validate?

00:47.412 --> 00:50.421
Mr. Shapiro, please, as
I said on the phone,

00:50.422 --> 00:52.451
the Figgis Agency values your business,

00:52.452 --> 00:54.461
and I can assure
you this internal affair

00:54.462 --> 00:57.341
doesn't reflect our
ability as investigators, so...

00:57.342 --> 00:58.431
- Yes, it does.
- Archer?

00:58.432 --> 00:59.491
What? Shut up. If anything,

00:59.492 --> 01:01.421
it proves I'm a great investigator.

01:01.422 --> 01:04.431
I totally just
Encyclopedia Browned that thing.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.501
Bugs Meany is wiping
his ass on our towels?

01:07.502 --> 01:11.471
- No, dummy!
- Yes! It's the only explanation!

01:11.472 --> 01:14.311
Well, or any of the Tigers.

01:14.312 --> 01:16.381
So, is it like a stamp, or stickers...

01:16.382 --> 01:18.421
Please, you've come all this way.

01:18.422 --> 01:20.022
And obviously you thought we were

01:20.047 --> 01:21.481
the right agency for the job.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.481
And besides, we're only 25
cents a day, plus expenses.

01:24.482 --> 01:26.321
For the love of Christ, woman!

01:26.322 --> 01:28.411
Seriously, you gotta shut up.

01:28.412 --> 01:30.311
You shut up! Because I'm catching

01:30.312 --> 01:32.401
the first bus outta this hick town!

01:34.342 --> 01:36.301
Ha! So long, Idaville!

01:36.302 --> 01:37.311
As I was saying...

01:37.312 --> 01:38.441
Okay.

01:38.442 --> 01:40.341
- Hmm?
- Okay!

01:40.342 --> 01:42.521
I can't get anyone else
on such late notice, and...

01:42.522 --> 01:45.501
I dunno. Maybe you
people can handle this job, so...

01:45.502 --> 01:48.421
Mind if I, uh, beep boop?

01:48.422 --> 01:51.361
Oh, preesh. Okay, so

01:51.362 --> 01:53.301
I'm sure you all remember my client,

01:53.302 --> 01:55.361
Hollywood legend Veronica Deane.

01:55.362 --> 01:56.441
- Remember?
- Ugh.

01:56.442 --> 01:58.331
- Who could forget?
- Right?

01:58.332 --> 02:00.371
She almost makes me Q my G.

02:00.372 --> 02:02.230
What, did she die of old age?

02:02.231 --> 02:03.521
Oh, for the... She's 50!

02:03.522 --> 02:06.481
And, if anything, more
beautiful than ever.

02:06.482 --> 02:08.300
Especially when she's wearing...

02:10.401 --> 02:12.501
the Tsarina, an
emerald and diamond necklace

02:12.502 --> 02:16.481
crafted for Empress Maria
Alexandrovna in 1855,

02:16.482 --> 02:20.491
and now the, uh,
centerpiece of Ms. Deane's collection.

02:20.492 --> 02:23.471
My God, it must be worth millions!

02:23.472 --> 02:25.361
And you want us to steal it!

02:25.362 --> 02:29.331
I... No! No, that's the
exact opposite of what I want.

02:29.332 --> 02:31.471
She wants to wear the
Tsarina to a fund-raiser

02:31.472 --> 02:34.411
hosted by her ex-husband, Ellis Crane,

02:34.412 --> 02:38.361
Oscar-winning director
and also total jit-rag.

02:38.362 --> 02:39.481
- Ooh!
- He's handsome!

02:39.482 --> 02:41.441
Ugh! Total jit-rag.

02:41.442 --> 02:43.451
Wearing that necklace to a crowded event

02:43.452 --> 02:45.371
seems like a pretty big risk.

02:45.372 --> 02:46.521
I know. Believe me,

02:46.522 --> 02:48.844
I tried to talk Ms.
Deane out of wearing it, but...

02:48.845 --> 02:50.471
Is it just to rub it in his face?

02:50.472 --> 02:53.381
Man, I'd rub it in his face!

02:57.322 --> 03:00.441
- Pam!
- I will stop, but I will not apologize.

03:00.442 --> 03:02.461
So, you want us to guard the necklace.

03:02.462 --> 03:04.481
Yes. Undercover, at the fund-raiser.

03:04.482 --> 03:10.451
For which, I am prepared to
pay your agency s... $50,000.

03:10.452 --> 03:12.461
- Oh, nice!
- Pretty good.

03:12.462 --> 03:14.401
But surely the necklace is insured.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.331
And even if the deductible was, like...

03:16.332 --> 03:18.311
Obviously more than that, Lana.

03:18.312 --> 03:20.351
- Yeah, Lana.
- Holy shit-snacks!

03:20.352 --> 03:23.351
So we're going to a no-shit
black-tie Hollywood gala?

03:23.352 --> 03:24.481
Well, yes, but...

03:24.482 --> 03:26.471
But what do we wear? Is
it, like, gowns and gloves?

03:26.472 --> 03:28.531
And do I rent a girdle? Are there
gonna be dress fittings?

03:28.532 --> 03:31.391
Do I get a bikini wax? And
I don't know my tiara size!

03:31.392 --> 03:33.401
And, oh, my God, what of shoes?

03:33.402 --> 03:36.511
Uh, your attire will be provided.

03:36.512 --> 03:40.311
This is gonna be suckin' amazing!

03:40.312 --> 03:44.342
Yeah. For five-eighths of you.

04:21.452 --> 04:25.302
And so, when I
said "suckin' amazing"...

04:26.472 --> 04:29.361
obviously I meant "suckin' bullshit."

04:29.362 --> 04:30.361
I mean...

04:30.362 --> 04:31.431
Seriously?

04:31.432 --> 04:34.301
Oh, quit your griping, you three.

04:34.302 --> 04:36.311
The whole idea is to blend in, so...

04:36.312 --> 04:37.411
Meaning?

04:37.412 --> 04:40.351
No. Meaning just... you know...

04:40.352 --> 04:42.501
You can't put lipstick on a pig.

04:42.502 --> 04:43.465
- Really?
- Excuse you?

04:43.490 --> 04:44.391
What's that supposed to mean?

04:44.392 --> 04:47.311
- Well, that's a little harsh.
- And also inaccurate.

04:47.312 --> 04:48.401
Lipstick, they don't really mind,

04:48.402 --> 04:51.361
but mascara? Huh, whole big thing.

04:51.362 --> 04:53.391
And I suppose he's blending?

04:53.392 --> 04:56.381
- Who?
- You, Otto Von Jizmarck.

04:56.382 --> 04:57.531
I was gonna say Franz Turdinand.

04:57.532 --> 04:58.822
- Eh...
- Guys, come on.

04:58.847 --> 05:00.371
What's going on here?

05:00.372 --> 05:02.401
I was just explaining some basic tenets

05:02.402 --> 05:04.351
of fieldcraft to these three.

05:04.352 --> 05:05.491
Yeah, you gotta blend,

05:05.492 --> 05:07.371
but I meant what's going
on hors d'oeuvre-wise.

05:07.372 --> 05:08.381
Wouldn't you like to...

05:08.382 --> 05:10.351
Blend.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.391
This is a deconstructed slider

05:12.392 --> 05:14.301
made from certified Kobe beef

05:14.302 --> 05:15.431
from Hyogo prefecture,

05:15.432 --> 05:16.531
with a tarragon aioli.

05:16.532 --> 05:19.391
Tapas of pata negra jamón iberico,

05:19.392 --> 05:21.421
topped with queso Torta del Casar.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.451
And these are tiny quiches,

05:23.452 --> 05:25.471
probably made from
endangered quail eggs, or...

05:25.472 --> 05:27.501
No, none of this is that.

05:27.502 --> 05:32.481
This is the world's
most expensive Mc10:35.

05:34.302 --> 05:35.511
Oh, for the... Sterling!

05:35.512 --> 05:37.361
Is that really necessary?

05:37.362 --> 05:39.301
Mm. Mm-hm.

05:39.302 --> 05:40.431
Mm. Ah.

05:40.432 --> 05:42.351
Lana, this is Hollywood.

05:42.352 --> 05:44.461
None of this is even remotely necessary.

05:49.332 --> 05:50.441
So if you'll excuse me,

05:50.442 --> 05:53.401
I'm gonna go guard some
priceless emeralds.

05:53.402 --> 05:54.451
Oh, really?

05:54.452 --> 05:56.361
You're gonna go do the job

05:56.362 --> 05:58.361
I'm paying you a fortune to do?

05:58.362 --> 05:59.531
Might as well.

05:59.532 --> 06:01.491
I'm already here.

06:01.492 --> 06:04.341
And speaking of guarding the Tsarina,

06:04.342 --> 06:05.664
do you think the optimal

06:05.689 --> 06:07.481
formation for that is a clump?

06:07.482 --> 06:08.702
Really?

06:08.727 --> 06:10.411
Some bullshit job.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.263
Oh, my God, even for Idaville,

06:12.264 --> 06:15.511
this stupid party is so boring!

06:15.512 --> 06:18.522
Like, hire a clown, tinnitus people.

06:21.392 --> 06:24.371
Whatever, Pocket Tony Montana.

06:24.372 --> 06:28.521
Wait! Tiny Montana.

06:30.502 --> 06:32.381
Either one,

06:32.382 --> 06:36.501
oughta be quarantined
in the sick burn unit.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.411
Excuse me. Hi. Pardon me.

06:39.412 --> 06:40.441
Sterling Archer.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.491
Hello. Pardon me.

06:41.492 --> 06:43.411
Or move, basically.

06:43.412 --> 06:45.331
Good evening, Archbishop.

06:45.332 --> 06:47.351
Could you hold this for me?

06:47.352 --> 06:49.411
Pardon me. Yep. S-Sorry.

06:49.412 --> 06:50.521
That was my hand.

06:50.522 --> 06:52.461
Jesus, glad I'm not allergic to mink.

06:52.462 --> 06:54.441
- Right?
- Hm?

06:54.442 --> 06:56.522
Oh, hi. Uh, so sorry. I thought

06:56.547 --> 06:58.401
you were Commodore Perry.

06:58.402 --> 07:00.381
Oh, how dare you!

07:00.382 --> 07:02.341
Remember the Maine!

07:02.342 --> 07:03.421
Couple things.

07:03.422 --> 07:06.361
A, Perry opened Japan to the West.

07:06.362 --> 07:08.501
He died 40 years before
the sinking of the Maine,

07:08.502 --> 07:11.351
the cause of which... spoiler alert...

07:11.352 --> 07:14.421
has since been proven to
be improper coal storage,

07:14.422 --> 07:16.461
not a Spanish harbor mine.

07:16.462 --> 07:18.321
And two...

07:18.322 --> 07:20.311
he didn't have sideburns.

07:20.312 --> 07:21.321
Did he not?

07:21.322 --> 07:22.481
No.

07:22.482 --> 07:25.361
He was totally...

07:25.362 --> 07:27.401
completely...

07:27.402 --> 07:31.491
clean...

07:31.492 --> 07:33.371
shaven.

07:33.372 --> 07:36.361
Wow. Talk about smooth sailing.

07:36.362 --> 07:39.301
It was clearly the Age of Steam.

07:39.302 --> 07:41.371
Hi. Sterling Archer.

07:41.372 --> 07:43.411
What the... That little bitch!

07:43.412 --> 07:46.321
Oh, you're way prettier than her.

07:46.322 --> 07:47.331
I meant Archer.

07:47.332 --> 07:50.331
And also, dahoy.

07:51.392 --> 07:54.301
- Oh!
- Shut up!

07:54.302 --> 07:56.431
Excuse me. Pardon me. Think
you're gonna flirt...

07:56.432 --> 07:57.501
Hello. Right in front of me...

07:57.502 --> 07:59.531
Hi. With some C-list C-word!

07:59.532 --> 08:01.321
Impossible.

08:01.322 --> 08:02.341
Huh?

08:02.342 --> 08:04.311
My dear, how can this be?

08:04.312 --> 08:06.361
How have you never
been in one of my pictures?

08:06.362 --> 08:08.461
Hm. Because I'm not an actress?

08:08.462 --> 08:10.521
Huh. In what sense?

08:10.522 --> 08:11.531
Every.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.301
Perhaps we should begin anew.

08:14.302 --> 08:17.311
Ellis Crane, Academy Award winner.

08:17.312 --> 08:19.391
Lana Kane, private investigator.

08:19.392 --> 08:20.421
You're kidding.

08:20.422 --> 08:22.421
No, so if you ever have

08:22.422 --> 08:24.441
anything that needs private
investigating...

08:24.442 --> 08:26.391
I thought you were a producer.

08:26.392 --> 08:28.461
Uh, I produce results.

08:28.462 --> 08:31.301
Idiot!

08:31.302 --> 08:32.371
How was that my fault?

08:32.371 --> 08:34.301
How is everything your fault?

08:34.302 --> 08:35.421
Aw, leave him alone.

08:35.422 --> 08:37.491
He's not the one trying
to shuck your lady-corn.

08:37.491 --> 08:39.491
My what?

08:39.491 --> 08:42.471
Oh, so that's how it is now, huh?

08:42.472 --> 08:45.481
Well, then you can tell Lana that
two can play at that game.

08:45.482 --> 08:46.521
Where's Veronica Deane?

08:46.522 --> 08:48.411
How should I know?

08:48.412 --> 08:51.331
Y... Because you're
supposed to be guarding her.

08:51.332 --> 08:53.531
I'm also supposed to be pooling tips.

08:53.532 --> 08:57.381
Which I haven't gotten any yet, so...

08:57.382 --> 08:59.381
Hey, Ray! You getting any tips?

08:59.382 --> 09:02.331
- Hang on!
- Excuse me. Pardon me.

09:02.332 --> 09:04.381
Idiot!

09:04.382 --> 09:06.331
What's up her bleached asshole?

09:06.332 --> 09:08.311
Okay, so, I've been
watching like a hawk,

09:08.312 --> 09:10.451
and here's the
whats... Lana's pissed at Archer

09:10.452 --> 09:11.793
'cause she thought he was macking on

09:11.818 --> 09:13.461
Bleached Asshole, and
she's pissed at Archer

09:13.462 --> 09:15.361
'cause she thought he
was a Hollywood honcho

09:15.362 --> 09:17.301
like ol' Whitey Crane over there,

09:17.302 --> 09:19.431
who is macking on Lana, who's
totally full of crap

09:19.432 --> 09:20.885
'cause deep down, she's totally

09:20.910 --> 09:22.431
buyin' into Whitey's bullshit.

09:22.432 --> 09:24.453
So to get back at her, Archer's gonna

09:24.478 --> 09:26.421
pretend to mack on, but not really,

09:26.422 --> 09:27.794
'cause deep down, he's got a

09:27.819 --> 09:29.411
real-life crush-boner for her,

09:29.412 --> 09:30.481
Veronica Deane!

09:30.482 --> 09:32.481
Who we're supposed to be guarding.

09:32.482 --> 09:34.431
Well, "whom," but yeah.

09:34.432 --> 09:36.361
And she is...

09:36.362 --> 09:37.441
I don't know who she's into.

09:37.442 --> 09:39.341
I meant, where is she?

09:39.342 --> 09:40.381
How should I know?

09:40.382 --> 09:42.471
Yeah, who is she, Kate Warne?

09:42.472 --> 09:43.471
- What?
- Anyway,

09:43.472 --> 09:45.401
I don't want to jinx it,

09:45.402 --> 09:49.471
but this might end up... a murder mystery.

09:49.472 --> 09:51.521
Well, fingers crossed.

09:51.522 --> 09:53.361
Clump!

09:53.362 --> 09:54.471
Aah...

10:05.014 --> 10:08.377
Okay.
Okay, here we go.

10:08.378 --> 10:10.437
Hello?

10:10.438 --> 10:13.298
Excuse me, Miss Deane?

10:17.328 --> 10:18.427
Yes?

10:20.378 --> 10:22.457
I have tinnitus.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.407
Why do we have to clean it up?

10:24.408 --> 10:26.407
Her dumb ass broke the damn thing.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.397
Well, he's the one
sneaking around, scaring people

10:28.398 --> 10:29.467
like Casper the Ghost.

10:29.468 --> 10:32.477
A... Casper was the Friendly Ghost.

10:32.478 --> 10:36.437
Well, take a page from his book.

10:36.438 --> 10:38.377
You ever wonder how Casper died?

10:38.378 --> 10:41.407
When you're finished here, un-clump!

10:41.408 --> 10:43.457
'Cause my theory is Casper and Spooky

10:43.458 --> 10:46.407
were kidnapped, raped, and murdered...

10:46.408 --> 10:47.517
by Stevie.

10:47.518 --> 10:50.467
Wow, that sounds pretty dark.

10:50.468 --> 10:53.307
No, Miss Kane, not dark.

10:53.308 --> 10:54.417
Noir.

10:54.418 --> 10:56.397
- I...
- Or nouveau noir, if you must,

10:56.398 --> 10:57.497
but rest assured, my dear,

10:57.498 --> 11:00.477
Deadly Velvet will redefine the genre.

11:00.478 --> 11:02.437
Of the private-eye movie?

11:06.438 --> 11:08.317
Um, are you...

11:08.318 --> 11:09.467
Madam, you wound me.

11:11.398 --> 11:14.397
Deadly Velvet is going to
be a cinematic tour de force,

11:14.398 --> 11:17.337
and I want you deeply involved.

11:17.338 --> 11:19.517
Well, but I haven't
been a private investigator

11:19.518 --> 11:21.287
for very long.

11:21.288 --> 11:22.397
Had Shocking Blue been a band

11:22.398 --> 11:24.407
very long before they recorded "Venus"?

11:24.408 --> 11:25.427
- I...
- No.

11:25.428 --> 11:26.457
I don't know.

11:26.458 --> 11:27.487
We can't know.

11:27.488 --> 11:29.457
And speaking of not knowing...

11:29.458 --> 11:31.457
what does a technical advisor even do?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.417
Well, advise on
technical matters, of course,

11:33.418 --> 11:35.347
but I think you could also help me

11:35.348 --> 11:39.387
really get inside the
mind of the private detective.

11:39.388 --> 11:43.387
What... makes... her... tick.

11:43.388 --> 11:45.387
Oh, wow, it's a female lead?

11:45.388 --> 11:48.307
What?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.367
Oh, God, no.

11:49.368 --> 11:52.297
What does Lana think she's doing?

11:52.298 --> 11:53.447
Well, I think she's...

11:53.448 --> 11:55.287
She's embarrassing herself. That's what.

11:55.288 --> 11:56.487
Fawning all over Ellis Crane.

11:56.488 --> 11:58.347
Trying to make Archer...

11:58.348 --> 11:59.477
When he's clearly much better suited

11:59.478 --> 12:01.437
for a woman like, well,

12:01.438 --> 12:02.477
me.

12:02.478 --> 12:05.297
Jealous. Hey, how's Ron?

12:05.298 --> 12:06.407
He's great.

12:06.408 --> 12:09.307
How's nobody?

12:11.488 --> 12:13.317
You're gon...

12:16.298 --> 12:17.487
I you on a blimp.

12:19.438 --> 12:21.417
Oh, my God!

12:21.418 --> 12:23.487
That's right.

12:23.488 --> 12:25.517
Man, what ever happened to blimps?

12:25.518 --> 12:27.507
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

12:27.508 --> 12:29.377
I mean, I do have tinnitus,

12:29.378 --> 12:30.487
but that's not the main thing.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.457
I'm sorry. I'm babbling.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.457
Hello. Uh, Sterling Archer.

12:34.458 --> 12:37.357
And we have actually met.

12:37.358 --> 12:39.477
You hired me to meet some blackmailers

12:39.478 --> 12:41.477
and exchange...

12:41.478 --> 12:43.327
I know exactly who you are.

12:43.328 --> 12:44.347
Hm?

12:44.348 --> 12:45.457
What I don't know, Mr. Archer,

12:45.458 --> 12:48.297
is why you would think
it even remotely acceptable

12:48.298 --> 12:49.407
to discuss such private matters

12:49.408 --> 12:51.297
in such a public setting.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.437
I'm sorry.

12:54.438 --> 12:57.387
It's all just so very sensitive.

12:57.388 --> 12:58.467
Now, why are you here?

12:58.468 --> 13:01.337
Well, for one thing, it's a great cause.

13:01.338 --> 13:03.337
But for another, more accurate thing,

13:03.338 --> 13:05.287
we're here because Shapiro hired us.

13:05.288 --> 13:06.347
What? Why?

13:06.348 --> 13:07.477
To guard the the Tsarina.

13:07.478 --> 13:10.347
I knew I shouldn't have worn it.

13:10.348 --> 13:12.327
No... Yes, you totally should have.

13:12.328 --> 13:14.407
And I get it. I get why you did.

13:14.408 --> 13:16.467
- I wore it bec...
- Because, come to find out,

13:16.468 --> 13:17.953
you and I find ourselves

13:17.978 --> 13:19.497
- in the same boat.
- What?

13:19.498 --> 13:21.467
And it's a totally shit boat,

13:21.468 --> 13:24.497
and the cargo is
pathetic petty jealousy.

13:24.498 --> 13:26.397
- What?
- And so I apologize

13:26.398 --> 13:27.467
for being so forward,

13:27.468 --> 13:29.387
but I think this needs to happen,

13:29.388 --> 13:31.357
and I think it's a win-win.

13:31.358 --> 13:32.467
What...

13:37.478 --> 13:39.477
Mother...

13:43.308 --> 13:44.377
What the...

13:45.488 --> 13:47.327
Get on the ground!

13:51.298 --> 13:52.377
Get down! Move!

13:52.378 --> 13:53.467
Archer!

13:53.468 --> 13:55.387
Lana!

13:55.388 --> 13:56.468
Come on.

14:01.378 --> 14:05.397
Ladies... and... gentlemen...

14:05.398 --> 14:06.467
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on.

14:06.468 --> 14:08.507
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

14:08.508 --> 14:12.407
That is so baller.

14:12.408 --> 14:15.417
But, like, old-school baller.

14:15.418 --> 14:18.357
- Like medicine baller.
- Shh.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.317
Children of all ages,

14:21.318 --> 14:24.507
welcome to this robbery.

14:24.508 --> 14:26.517
I am your host,

14:26.518 --> 14:29.427
Mr. Rompers.

14:29.428 --> 14:31.338
And I did not tell you to stop.

14:32.388 --> 14:35.347
♪ ♪

14:35.348 --> 14:37.307
Okay, I think that red one's the leader,

14:37.308 --> 14:39.307
so you're gonna want
to take him out first.

14:39.308 --> 14:41.367
Now, we do not wish to harm you.

14:41.368 --> 14:43.297
Take him out? With what?

14:43.298 --> 14:45.307
But if you try anything foolish...

14:45.308 --> 14:46.407
How do you not have a gun?

14:46.408 --> 14:47.507
Uh, dahoy.

14:47.508 --> 14:49.477
You will die here tonight.

14:49.478 --> 14:51.367
Oh, right. Yeah, that thing's

14:51.368 --> 14:53.357
about three sizes too small as it is.

14:53.358 --> 14:55.357
And how do you not have a gun?

14:55.358 --> 14:57.347
Well, I would have if I had a jacket,

14:57.348 --> 14:59.347
but since I'm just a lowly waiter...

14:59.348 --> 15:01.327
Well, maybe you can pout your way out.

15:02.408 --> 15:04.357
Shh...

15:04.358 --> 15:05.417
That was her,

15:05.418 --> 15:07.347
running her fat mouth.

15:17.213 --> 15:18.959
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:19.131 --> 15:21.861
please, this is all very simple.

15:21.862 --> 15:23.891
Every phone line has been cut.

15:23.892 --> 15:25.981
Every exit has been booby-trapped.

15:25.982 --> 15:27.293
Now, please, give your

15:27.318 --> 15:28.961
cell phones to Mr. Oingo.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.951
He's the handsome gentleman in orange.

15:30.952 --> 15:33.791
And give your valuables to Mr. Boingo.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.791
He's the handsome gentleman in blue!

15:35.792 --> 15:38.781
Please, we do not wish to harm you!

15:38.782 --> 15:40.941
Please, just do as they say!

15:40.942 --> 15:43.871
Thank you, my good sir. Finished?

15:43.872 --> 15:45.901
Hm? Uh, hm. Uh, yes...

15:47.782 --> 15:48.841
Are you insane?

15:48.842 --> 15:49.941
I don't know. Maybe.

15:49.942 --> 15:51.801
But check this out.

15:52.972 --> 15:54.951
And that, ladies and germs,

15:54.952 --> 15:57.831
is the very best you can expect.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.220
And if Veronica Deane

15:59.221 --> 16:02.751
doesn't get her wrinkly old
ass out here with the Tsarina,

16:02.752 --> 16:04.881
I guess we'll have to go find it!

16:04.882 --> 16:06.871
Shh.

16:06.872 --> 16:08.751
First of all...

16:08.752 --> 16:10.911
Giggles! Yum-Yum! Pinky Brewster!

16:10.912 --> 16:14.819
Tear this place apart, room by room!

16:14.820 --> 16:16.971
And please don't take
this the wrong way,

16:16.972 --> 16:19.931
but your butt is like ka-kow.

16:19.932 --> 16:20.961
They're going to kill me.

16:20.962 --> 16:22.871
No, no, they're not.

16:22.872 --> 16:24.981
I have a plan, but I'm
going to need you to trust me.

16:24.982 --> 16:26.801
Why?

16:26.802 --> 16:27.670
Because this.

16:27.828 --> 16:28.931
What are you doing?

16:28.932 --> 16:29.981
They'll see it.

16:29.982 --> 16:32.097
Shh. I know. I want them to.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.384
What? Why?

16:33.385 --> 16:34.891
Because I'm gonna... um,

16:34.892 --> 16:36.831
incapacitate one of them

16:36.832 --> 16:37.931
and then take his place.

16:37.932 --> 16:39.791
Are you insane?

16:39.792 --> 16:40.971
What? It's a proven concept.

16:40.972 --> 16:43.811
Luke Skywalker and Han Solo.

16:43.812 --> 16:45.891
Um, probably a ton of other examples.

16:45.892 --> 16:47.841
Oh, God. I'm gonna die.

16:47.842 --> 16:49.751
- I'm gonna die.
- Shh, hush, no you're not,

16:49.752 --> 16:50.871
I'm gonna get you out of here.

16:50.872 --> 16:51.961
But to do that,

16:51.962 --> 16:53.981
I'm gonna have to do a very bad thing.

16:53.982 --> 16:56.861
W-What? What do you mean?

16:56.862 --> 16:58.761
Great.

16:58.762 --> 16:59.922
Had to be the goofy pink one.

17:01.351 --> 17:02.981
Just promise me you won't scream.

17:02.982 --> 17:04.771
I... What?

17:04.771 --> 17:05.881
I can't promise that.

17:05.882 --> 17:07.771
Okay, so if you feel it coming,

17:07.771 --> 17:09.840
maybe just do it into
your hand, phrasing.

17:09.842 --> 17:10.891
Can you do that for me?

17:10.892 --> 17:12.810
I... I don't know.

17:12.811 --> 17:13.820
I'll try.

17:13.821 --> 17:14.861
Good, you're doing great.

17:14.862 --> 17:15.971
Just remember to breathe

17:15.972 --> 17:17.771
in and out.

17:17.771 --> 17:18.891
In...

17:18.892 --> 17:20.771
and out.

17:20.771 --> 17:21.861
In...

17:21.862 --> 17:22.901
and out.

17:22.902 --> 17:24.830
Phrasing, doing great,

17:24.832 --> 17:26.921
and sorry in advance for
what's about to happen.

17:29.852 --> 17:31.831
Oh, baby,

17:31.832 --> 17:32.971
don't you worry.

17:32.972 --> 17:35.901
I'm gonna give you something
to scream about.

17:35.902 --> 17:37.761
Hey, Rompers, guess...

17:51.912 --> 17:54.811
So hey, again, I'm sorry.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.881
Why, that wasn't so bad.

17:56.882 --> 17:58.951
I mean, you made it
sound like you were going to...

18:02.882 --> 18:05.881
No, sorry for that.

18:05.882 --> 18:06.981
Why did you do that?

18:06.982 --> 18:09.445
What? That... That's how you do it.

18:09.566 --> 18:10.951
You could have just tied him up.

18:10.952 --> 18:13.821
With what? And also, no, I couldn't.

18:13.822 --> 18:14.921
That only works in the movies.

18:14.922 --> 18:17.751
He would've gotten loose or yelled or...

18:17.752 --> 18:19.801
Well, shooting him would've
been better than that.

18:19.802 --> 18:21.841
Not for him. Plus it's really loud,

18:21.842 --> 18:23.911
and I actually do have tinnitus, so...

18:23.912 --> 18:25.891
Where did you learn that, the army?

18:25.892 --> 18:29.677
What? No, no, God, no.

18:29.678 --> 18:30.891
But, I mean, don't get me wrong.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.841
I truly appreciate the sacrifices

18:32.842 --> 18:34.891
of the men and women who
serve in our armed forces,

18:34.892 --> 18:36.990
but there's easier ways to almost

18:37.015 --> 18:38.841
be eligible for food stamps.

18:38.842 --> 18:40.901
It is just criminal what they get paid.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.911
Although, I'd probably be an officer.

18:42.912 --> 18:44.971
Still, though...

18:44.972 --> 18:46.931
seems like a lot of running.

18:46.932 --> 18:48.771
And now if you'll excuse me,

18:48.772 --> 18:50.811
I'm going to go kill some evil clowns.

18:51.972 --> 18:53.791
Do you...

18:53.792 --> 18:54.891
have an erection?

18:54.892 --> 18:56.752
No.

18:57.982 --> 18:58.982
No.

19:15.706 --> 19:16.795
There he is.

19:18.586 --> 19:19.705
How you doing, bub?

19:19.706 --> 19:20.795
Uh, who...

19:20.796 --> 19:22.695
Whuzza...

19:22.696 --> 19:24.725
Where... What happened?

19:24.726 --> 19:26.747
Oh, my God, what didn't happen?

19:26.892 --> 19:28.384
Well, for starters,

19:28.385 --> 19:29.725
you're a one-hitter quitter.

19:29.726 --> 19:31.765
Wait. How long was I out?

19:31.766 --> 19:33.765
Hm, like five hours?

19:33.766 --> 19:35.892
Oh, that is not good.

19:36.039 --> 19:37.655
Uh, no.

19:37.656 --> 19:39.025
You're gonna want a brain scan,

19:39.233 --> 19:40.775
you know, if we don't get murdered.

19:40.776 --> 19:42.565
Which...

19:42.566 --> 19:43.625
Veronica!

19:43.626 --> 19:44.625
Where's Veronica?

19:44.626 --> 19:45.775
That's the thing.

19:45.776 --> 19:47.635
Nobody knows.

19:47.636 --> 19:49.645
And these guys are losing their shit.

19:49.646 --> 19:50.755
Well, they're under a lot of stress.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.635
Don't start.

19:52.636 --> 19:54.605
Because somehow, some stupid idiot

19:54.606 --> 19:55.765
must've called 911.

19:55.766 --> 19:58.575
And so about a jillion
cops showed up,

19:58.576 --> 20:00.685
so then it was a full-on siege.

20:00.686 --> 20:02.715
And then after that, the head clown...

20:02.716 --> 20:04.745
Mr. Rompers.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.575
He's awesome.

20:06.576 --> 20:07.765
And he was like, "This blows dicks.

20:07.766 --> 20:09.675
The bathroom situation's a nightmare.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.595
I'm making an executive decision.

20:11.596 --> 20:12.735
This is too many hostages."

20:12.736 --> 20:14.715
And so then they let everyone go.

20:14.716 --> 20:16.795
Wait, what? Everybody?

20:16.796 --> 20:19.785
Well, except for kinda...

20:19.786 --> 20:23.615
the core group.

20:23.616 --> 20:25.735
Oh, and the band, which...

20:25.736 --> 20:28.645
Good job, guys! Doing great!

20:28.646 --> 20:31.063
Goddamn it!

20:31.088 --> 20:33.665
What did I say about running your mouth?

20:33.666 --> 20:35.745
Sorry, that was my jam.

20:35.746 --> 20:38.685
Hey, Mr. Rompers.

20:38.686 --> 20:40.675
Shut... up!

20:40.676 --> 20:42.575
Everybody!

20:43.606 --> 20:45.575
Wait, so did...

20:45.576 --> 20:46.595
Shut up.

20:46.596 --> 20:47.645
Pam, tell him the best part.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.735
Wh... That is the least best part.

20:49.736 --> 20:51.565
Tell him!

20:51.566 --> 20:52.595
So Cheryl here...

20:52.596 --> 20:53.735
I'm sorry.

20:53.736 --> 20:57.615
Tania here has decided she's
got Stockholm Syndrome.

20:57.616 --> 21:00.775
And soon I will be Mrs. Rompers.

21:00.776 --> 21:02.675
Again, that's if we don't get murdered.

21:03.716 --> 21:05.616
Shh.

21:06.636 --> 21:08.626
Which...

21:08.960 --> 21:12.670
