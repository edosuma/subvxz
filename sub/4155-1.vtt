WEBVTT

00:23.457 --> 00:25.626
DANNY: I grew up in
Staten Island, New York.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.763
It might not sound
like it, but I did.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.205
For those of you
who don't know,

00:37.238 --> 00:40.841
Staten Island
is like Brooklyn
and New Jersey had a baby.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.511
A baby that would
grow up to be either
a cop or a fireman.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.784
And you know,
Staten Island
gets a bad rap,

00:50.818 --> 00:53.321
but, really,
it's just like
any other suburb.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.827
I mean, sure,
it looks like this.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.263
And this.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.734
But what most people
don't realize

01:06.767 --> 01:09.403
is that Staten Island
also looks like this.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.107
And this.

01:49.677 --> 01:50.811
And for me,

01:50.844 --> 01:52.213
every single summer

01:52.246 --> 01:55.416
since I was old enough
to remember looked like this.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.285
The Great Kills Swim Club.

02:04.458 --> 02:08.362
This is where I spent
every waking hour
of my summers.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.265
From 8:00 a.m. swim practice
until they threw us
out at night,

02:11.299 --> 02:13.434
this is where
I found friendship.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.603
This is where
I tasted victory and defeat.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.072
Where I fell in love.

02:19.106 --> 02:22.376
And it's where
I had the best job
in the history of the world.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.178
I was a lifeguard.

02:25.613 --> 02:29.383
Now, there are
beach lifeguards who
actually guard lives.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.784
Wendell, I told you
to get out.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.985
DANNY: And then
there are pool guards...

02:32.019 --> 02:33.421
Make me.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.789
DANNY: ...who
basically do this.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.758
The only reason
I became a lifeguard
is because of this idiot.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.026
FRANK: Danny.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.362
DANNY: My best friend
in the whole world,
Frank Gomes.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.165
Frank said that
girls couldn't resist
a man in uniform

02:45.199 --> 02:46.534
and that we'd be, quote...
(BLOWS WHISTLE)

02:46.567 --> 02:47.868
Don't drown.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.538
DANNY:
"...knee-deep in snizz."

02:50.571 --> 02:53.140
But the only thing
Frank was knee-deep in
was the baby pool.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.808
Hey, what you
got there?

02:55.776 --> 02:58.912
SPF 50? No wonder
you two look so young.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.215
You know,
if we hooked up,

03:01.249 --> 03:03.684
I'd have to
turn myself in
for statutory rape.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.288
Statutory rape's
the not-bad rape.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.156
Hey. (BLOWS WHISTLE)
No leaving.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.524
DANNY: I don't know
what it was,

03:10.558 --> 03:13.026
but Staten Island girls
were never interested
in me and Frank.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.628
Well, that went well.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.730
DANNY: They were always
too busy fawning over
this kind of guy.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.532
You know, I'm pretty sure
you guys are just
aiming too high.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.967
DANNY: That's Anthony De Bono.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.202
It's really funny, though.
You should keep doing it.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.604
DANNY: I'm pretty sure
that Anthony was

03:23.637 --> 03:25.773
sculpted right out of
a suburban mom's sex fantasy.

03:25.806 --> 03:29.710
Hello, beautiful ladies.
How's everybody doing?

03:29.743 --> 03:32.813
Candace, I love
the new suit.
That's very cute.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.882
DANNY: Anthony was
joining the Navy.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.451
If he could pass
the written exam,
which he could not.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.488
Hope I don't
get you too wet.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.790
DANNY: As far as I could tell,
being in the Navy was, like,

03:42.823 --> 03:46.827
90% pushups
and 10% saying
"God bless America".

03:46.860 --> 03:48.796
(ALL CLAPPING)
That's how they
do it in the Navy.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.565
God bless America.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.901
DANNY: That's Mary Ellen.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.003
Stupid.
Ah! What the fuck?

03:56.036 --> 03:58.506
DANNY: Her dad was a cop,
and she was basically
raised a dude.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.241
Pee in my pool? Uh-uh.
Punks get dunked.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.644
DANNY: And that guy?

04:03.677 --> 04:06.380
The guy rolling in
an hour and a half
late to work?

04:06.414 --> 04:08.782
That was Billy Thomson.
(VOMITS)

04:08.816 --> 04:10.618
Better known as Skootch.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.421
Skootch did this year round.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.823
Summers at the swim club
and winters at the YMCA.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.726
He was a lifeguard.
That's all he was.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.330
He was Skootch.
BOY: Skootch!

04:23.130 --> 04:24.898
DANNY: We were a team.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.335
United together
against this one asshole.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.310
Our manager, Chuck Casino.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.852
Mr. Marcus, how are you?

04:44.885 --> 04:46.253
They find your kid?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.155
They will.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.491
Mr. Stewart, my man.
(CHUCKLES)

04:50.524 --> 04:53.427
Hey, here they go,
one, two, three musketeers.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.895
(COUGHS)

04:55.363 --> 04:57.030
(SIGHS)

04:57.064 --> 04:58.766
DANNY: Chuck thought
he ran the place.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.334
CHUCK: I am
the captain of this ship.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.737
This is my Amistad.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.407
DANNY: But no one runs summer.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.710
It was paradise.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.713
But hey, even
Adam and Eve couldn't
stay in heaven forever.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.348
And right after Labor Day...

05:14.382 --> 05:16.116
You're leaving us?

05:16.149 --> 05:18.686
Ma, I told you,
he's going to Harvard.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.020
MRS. BANDINI JR.:
And Anthony's
joining the Navy.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.755
We're losing all
the cute lifeguards.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.592
Not all the cute lifeguards.
I'll still be around, ladies.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.627
You smell like beef.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.230
We're proud of you, Danny.
Oh, you're a good kid.
Come here.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.465
Come here.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.133
Let me at him.
Let me at him.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.134
Thanks, Mrs. Bandini.
Let me at him.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.536
Mrs. Bandini Jr.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.137
Oh! We're all huggy.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.472
Ow!

05:38.506 --> 05:40.240
Okay. See you guys.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.242
Enjoy your game
of slowly dying.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.677
Bye.
Fuck off.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.481
Danny, if you had
half the game
with younger women

05:47.515 --> 05:49.282
that you do
with older women,

05:49.316 --> 05:52.085
you'd be laying it down.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.654
I talk to women our age.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.156
I'm sorry?
Women our age?

05:56.189 --> 05:59.226
I don't know any
"women our age".
I know a bunch of girls.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.629
See, that vocabulary
you have.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.131
You're wearing
a giant sign that says,
"I'm a virgin."

06:04.164 --> 06:05.699
As opposed to you?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.901
Technically,
I had half of my tip
inside Megan O'Reilly

06:07.935 --> 06:10.571
before her fucking cat
attacked me. Okay?

06:10.604 --> 06:11.905
Do you understand
that you could get

06:11.939 --> 06:14.542
any single girl
in this entire place?

06:14.575 --> 06:16.610
But you don't. Why?

06:16.644 --> 06:19.747
Well, I'm sorry
if I have higher
standards than you.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.783
Really? Do you
want to have sex
on Christmas?

06:22.816 --> 06:25.318
What are you, Hugh Grant?
You're just a guy.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.287
You're just a...
CHUCK: Campbell!

06:27.320 --> 06:29.557
Some kid puked in
the Lost and Found.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.192
I want you to
wash all the clothes
and put them back in.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.995
Translation,
"You're my bitch."

06:35.028 --> 06:38.098
And Gomes!
Get your ass back
in the baby pool!

06:38.999 --> 06:41.735
Now who's the bitch, bitch?

06:41.769 --> 06:45.272
(IMITATES BATMAN)
It's definitely not me.
Bye, Bane.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.840
DANNY: (IMITATES BANE)
Bye, Batman.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.613
Victor, what are you doing?

06:53.313 --> 06:55.115
Found this fucking frog.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.950
Gonna shoot it
out of this
fucking leaf blower.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.554
Jesus Christ.

07:02.322 --> 07:05.993
No. No, no, no.
You guys, you cannot invite
a mom to a staff party.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.528
Skootch, first of all,
is the keeper of the keys.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.696
So, what do you
think, Skootch,

07:08.729 --> 07:09.930
can Ms. Greeley
come to the party?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.398
Mmm.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.867
I'll allow it.
Yes, he will.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.268
And you know,
the best part is, dude,

07:15.302 --> 07:17.004
she had a kid,
like, a year ago, man.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.640
She's still fucking stacked.
Oh, it's incredible.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.476
You're abysmal.
Would Danny ever say
anything like that?

07:22.510 --> 07:25.078
No, Danny would not say
something like that,
because he's Irish.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.279
And Irish kids
develop later.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.682
Okay? They don't think
about sex till they're,
like, 25.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.284
Wow. That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.921
It's a biology fact,
Mary Ellen. Okay?
Read a fucking book.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.088
"Biology fact..."

07:35.122 --> 07:37.257
Okay, look. First there's
Hispanic guys, obviously.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.660
Then the black guys.
Then the Italians.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.630
Then the French.
And then the Irish, all right?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.765
And then probably, like,
the Asians eventually.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.800
Oh, my God.
When you join the Navy,

07:46.834 --> 07:49.570
their collective IQ
is gonna drop,
like, 25 points.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.305
Like, you're going
to sink our ships.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.440
Hey, look.
If you're in love with me,

07:53.473 --> 07:54.608
just say you're
in love with me.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.076
Yeah.
You know.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.745
Is that how you say
it in sign language?

07:57.778 --> 07:59.279
Is it that?
No, that's "Fuck you."

07:59.312 --> 08:00.814
Oh! That's "Fuck you."

08:04.818 --> 08:07.555
Hey, scram, kids.
Beat it. It's adult swim

08:08.388 --> 08:09.957
in the bathroom.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.834
I'm the king of the castle.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.371
(WHISTLING)

08:24.404 --> 08:25.573
(CHUCKLES)

08:25.606 --> 08:26.640
(CLICKS TONGUE)

08:37.150 --> 08:39.219
Home sweet home.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.288
My own executive bathroom.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.659
(GRUNTING)

08:46.560 --> 08:48.195
Dude. Ow. Truce?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.598
Sorry, man.
Truce.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.433
RACHEL: Wow.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.836
You guys have
really matured this summer.

08:57.304 --> 09:01.208
DANNY: Rachel
and Rebecca Rabinowitz.
Half Asian, half Jewish.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.777
They were identical,
but somehow everyone agreed,

09:03.811 --> 09:05.245
Rachel was the hot one.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.580
FRANK: Oh! Rachel.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.448
Rebecca.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.718
How are you guys?
RACHEL: Good.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.120
So, hey. Are you guys
going to the staff party
on Saturday?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.387
Ooh. Staff party.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.123
Uh, Danny's not,

09:16.156 --> 09:18.491
'cause he's going to Orlando
to get his vagina enlarged,

09:18.525 --> 09:20.293
but I will be there.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.395
Oh! That's cute
they invite
the baby pool lifeguards.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.131
Oh, it's cute
that you exist.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.066
Why can't there just be
two of you, Rachel?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.201
Why can't there
be zero Franks?

09:28.235 --> 09:32.439
I do everything here, okay?
I'm not a baby pool lifeguard.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.909
I'm a lifeguard
who happens to be
at the baby pool right now.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.310
Cool.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.113
Well, it's been great
hanging out with you guys.
See you later.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.215
Bye, Danny.
Not bye, Frank.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.952
Bye, Rachel. I love you.
Please die in a fire, Rebecca.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.155
VICTOR: Chuck, you in here?

09:48.188 --> 09:49.522
Chuck. Chuck.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.524
Yo. Chuck.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.861
Not now, Victor.
Go away, buddy.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.996
Yeah. Okay, yeah.
But you know,

09:56.029 --> 09:58.966
there's a hornets' nest
by the handball court.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.969
This thing is insane, man.
It's like
a hornet Mexico City.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.237
Talk to me about it in,
like, 20 minutes.
Not now!

10:05.739 --> 10:07.875
Just... Victor, just
take care of the nest.
Get out of here.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.043
God. Get your
face out of here.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.578
Chuck, all right,
I'm on it, man.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.647
Are you still there?
Yeah, I'm on it. Okay.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.182
Thank you
for the opportunity.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.686
(EXHALES)

10:18.719 --> 10:21.021
Am I the only one
that's normal around here?

10:23.190 --> 10:24.391
Look at that horse.
(CHUCKLES)

10:25.726 --> 10:27.861
That one's brown as hell.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.363
Oh, Danny.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.600
Why can't you just
man up for once
in your life, okay?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.068
This is the last
weekend of summer.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.336
I am being a man.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.771
You think this is
easy for me?

10:37.805 --> 10:40.207
The only reason why I'm going
is because it means
a lot to my parents.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.676
Okay, well,
the staff party
is this Saturday.

10:42.710 --> 10:46.046
And you know what?
Danny, it means
a lot to me.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.082
I have been laying track
with Rachel all summer.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.952
And she's finally into me,
and I think I'm gonna S the D.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.254
Suck the dick?

10:54.287 --> 10:57.257
What? No.
Seal the deal.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.992
Why don't you just say that?
Because it's
a shorter way...

10:59.026 --> 11:01.128
It doesn't matter. Okay?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.496
The staff party
is the culmination
of the entire summer.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.098
It's basically
summer prom.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.300
And you know what happens
at prom, Danny?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.569
Girls S the D.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.304
Seal the deal.
Suck the dick.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.740
Are you not listening?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.742
It's like a milestone
in their lives.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.176
It's like
the moon landing.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.979
But instead of a pole
going into the ground,

11:19.012 --> 11:20.680
it's our dicks
going into them.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.683
Ow!

11:23.717 --> 11:25.052
God, man.
Whoa!

11:25.385 --> 11:26.286
Harvard.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.325
The party is
officially on.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.593
Whew!

11:33.626 --> 11:35.395
Danny's favorite chicken.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.097
Okay.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.133
Not only do we have access
to all four parks

11:41.802 --> 11:44.171
plus Typhoon Lagoon,
so bring your suit,

11:45.005 --> 11:46.339
but... Drum roll, please.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.179
We got Fastpasses.
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

11:52.712 --> 11:54.147
Nice.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.016
Remember when you
used to stand up

11:56.049 --> 11:57.885
and recite the entire
Jungle Cruise?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.853
'Cause you had
the whole ride memorized.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.521
MOM: And then
the hippo would come out,

12:01.554 --> 12:05.625
and you, you'd put your arm
inside your shirt like
the hippo bit it off.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.327
DANNY: Yeah.
(LAUGHING)

12:08.395 --> 12:10.764
I was terrified one time.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.966
I'm really excited.
It just kind of sucks

12:13.000 --> 12:14.968
that I'm not gonna be here
for my last weekend
with Frank.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.606
Mmm.

12:19.639 --> 12:22.275
Well, you know,
I mean, Frank...

12:22.309 --> 12:24.411
You two are
gonna keep in touch.
Mmm-hmm.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.379
You're gonna make
new friends at Harvard.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.482
You know. And who knows?
Maybe you're gonna
meet a couple of

12:29.516 --> 12:31.084
cute ladies.
Oh!

12:32.485 --> 12:34.487
Maybe not her, but...

12:34.521 --> 12:36.423
It's just that
you and Frank...

12:36.456 --> 12:38.091
Honey, you're just
on different paths.
You know?

12:38.125 --> 12:39.426
And again, we love Frank.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.362
Yeah, love him to death.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.864
(WATER FLUSHING)

12:46.466 --> 12:48.001
(CLEARS THROAT)
Hey.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.302
Frank.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.005
Sorry that took so long.
I got distracted on my phone.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.207
I was playing a new game.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.010
Oh, yeah?
What's that, Frank?
Oh!

12:57.044 --> 13:00.113
It's like Whac-A-Mole,
but with penises
and glory holes.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.115
And you just,
like, whack the penis

13:02.149 --> 13:04.885
back into the glory hole,
so it doesn't...

13:04.918 --> 13:06.153
Doesn't, you know...
I understand.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.422
FRANK: How's the
Disney planning going?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.758
Oh, my God.
Dude, do you
remember that one time

13:11.791 --> 13:13.726
where you did
the entire Jungle Cruise

13:13.760 --> 13:14.962
and everybody
laughed at you

13:14.995 --> 13:17.230
because you looked
like a fucking moron?

13:17.264 --> 13:20.533
All right, you,
I'm gonna go shut that door
and open a window.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.104
Maybe knock down a wall.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.106
I just hear the cat kind of
screaming a little bit.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.512
(BLOWING TRUMPET)

13:58.338 --> 13:59.973
FRANK: Guys, you gotta
check this out.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.408
Look at all these
beautiful women that

14:01.441 --> 14:04.544
Danny's gonna be
going to college with.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.180
ANTHONY: Oh, what is that?
Dog and Elephant Quarterly?

14:07.214 --> 14:09.249
DANNY: Why do you
even have that?
FRANK: Because I found it.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.152
Look at this girl.
She's a butter everything.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.088
She'd be hot
"but her everything".
(LAUGHING)

14:15.122 --> 14:17.124
MARY ELLEN: Hey, Frank,
serious question.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.859
Have you ever seen yourself,
like, in a mirror?

14:19.893 --> 14:21.728
Because actually,
on a Frank scale,

14:21.761 --> 14:23.663
that girl's, like,
a hundred Franks.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.733
And on the Mary Ellen scale,
she's about half a Mary Ellen.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.835
That's a compliment,
what you've just said.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.938
Mine actually was
not a compliment to you.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.539
What's the brochure like
for your parents' basement?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.107
This isn't about me.

14:34.141 --> 14:36.143
This is about Danny
banging someone decent

14:36.176 --> 14:38.578
before he goes off
to Monsters University.

14:38.611 --> 14:42.115
What I don't understand is,
why you need
a party to get laid.

14:42.149 --> 14:45.185
Why don't you just
go out and just
bang something?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.820
Yeah, you say that because
you hook up with moms.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.822
Moms don't need
a party to have sex.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.224
They need a glass
of shitty wine.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.060
Hey, Anthony.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.262
Hi.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.363
Happy noon.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.135
Oh, man.
Ladies, I brought lunch.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.439
Doctors say you don't
get the benefits of wine
until the third glass.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.008
No way.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.943
I know. She's great,
isn't she?

15:09.977 --> 15:11.544
SKOOTCH: No, no, not her.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.281
Her.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.819
DANNY: Until that moment,

15:19.852 --> 15:22.255
I had been perfectly
content to leave
Staten Island forever.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.860
But just when
I thought I was out,
it pulled me back in.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.596
(CLASSIC ROCK PLAYING)

15:29.629 --> 15:31.198
Krystal Manicucci.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.004
She was the undisputed
Queen of Staten Island.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.212
And she was
the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen in my life.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.552
What?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.387
Don't do that.
You're giving me
the heebie-jeebies.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.056
When you stare like that,
you look like a serial killer.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.093
Bro, you got to
forget about Krystal.
All right?

16:33.126 --> 16:35.228
Why? So you can
get with her?

16:35.262 --> 16:39.532
No, even I'm not
that stupid. All right?
Her dad's Leo Manicucci.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.668
Like on the side of
all those heating oil trucks?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.303
So?

16:43.336 --> 16:45.872
So, the dude's
old school Mafia.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.474
Okay. You guys know
my buddy Tim?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.376
Well, his friend
Dave asked her

16:49.409 --> 16:50.943
to the sophomore-junior
semiformal. All right?

16:50.977 --> 16:52.179
No big deal, you'd think.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.547
Well, he found out,
went to the dude's house,

16:54.581 --> 16:57.016
ripped out his mailbox
and fucking beat him
half to death with it

16:57.050 --> 16:58.318
in front of his
whole family.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.720
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
Yes.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.589
That's the most
ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.924
Shut up.
Then don't believe me.
All right?

17:04.957 --> 17:06.292
Oh, I won't.
It's your fucking funeral.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.771
(HORNETS BUZZING)

17:22.775 --> 17:24.711
Man, that thing
is messed up.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.381
There's probably, like,
a thousand hornets in there.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.851
Now go spray it.
No way. You go.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.553
All right, fine.
But don't move.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.065
Okay, that's not
going to work.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.135
I think we need
to take this to
the next level.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.369
Yeah, damn right we do.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.775
Yo.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.043
Hairy Melon.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.645
Wassup? Uh, question.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.613
If I got to transport,
like, 144 passengers

18:00.647 --> 18:04.217
and I have,
like, a 36-seat van,

18:04.251 --> 18:06.286
how many trips is
that gonna take?
Probably, like 11.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.322
I think it's more like four.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.491
Yeah. No, no, like,
those weren't the numbers,

18:11.524 --> 18:12.825
the exact numbers
that I...
Okay.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.061
I was using
a couple of different
groups of numbers. So...

18:15.094 --> 18:17.029
If you want,
I could help you study.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.299
Like, I used to
do SAT prep.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.168
Yeah, okay. Well,
SATs are for pussies.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.735
And...
Okay.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.104
I got my own system.
It's gonna be fine.
And I do not need your help.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.274
So don't you worry
your pretty little head.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.377
Yo. Bullshit.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.280
There's no color
called indigo.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.716
Yeah, there is.
It's in the rainbow.
You know, Roy G. Biv?

18:36.749 --> 18:39.219
A guy named Roy G. Biv
invented the rainbow?

18:39.252 --> 18:40.987
How do you
invent the rainbow?

18:41.020 --> 18:42.622
I think it's like,
if you're really gay

Hi, Ms. Greeley.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.736
Hi, Anthony.

18:56.769 --> 19:00.340
I was wondering
if you could assist me.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.343
It would be my pleasure.
Let me see that.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.678
Ms. Greeley, I am worried

19:05.712 --> 19:08.315
maybe you've had,
like, a little too much
to drink forever.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.082
We're breaking a lot of rules.

19:10.116 --> 19:13.320
We have lifeguards drinking.
There's glass by the pool.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.455
Oh, my God.
What are you,
the wine police?

19:15.488 --> 19:17.590
Yeah.
What are you going
to do, arrest me?

19:17.624 --> 19:18.991
Boo!
Aah!

19:19.025 --> 19:19.892
Anthony.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.762
Would you say
you have a big dick?

19:24.130 --> 19:25.265
Hmm?

Wow.

Well, well, well.

and the stomach's on fire, but

just watch out for that.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.788
So, you got any
big plans this weekend?

19:49.756 --> 19:50.990
(GROANING)

19:51.023 --> 19:52.559
No?

19:52.592 --> 19:54.494
That's funny,
because last weekend
of summer,

19:54.527 --> 19:55.862
I remember
when we were lifeguards,

19:55.895 --> 19:57.897
before I was promoted
to manager over you,

19:59.031 --> 20:01.434
we used to always
have a staff party.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.869
I was, of course,
never invited,

20:02.902 --> 20:05.438
but also chose
independently not to go.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.575
So, no party
this year, though?

20:09.842 --> 20:10.743
I hope not.

20:12.445 --> 20:16.015
If you are having a party
and I catch you,

20:16.048 --> 20:19.218
I will finally
have the excuse I need
to fire your fat ass.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.454
And I'll be
locking up from now on.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.526
See these guys?
These are Chuck's now.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.698
I find out you're
having a party...

Danny, you're
scaring the children.

21:49.275 --> 21:50.743
She's perfect.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.079
Oh, my God. She was saying
the same thing about you,

21:53.112 --> 21:55.648
in your dreams,
when you were
jerking off to her.

21:55.682 --> 21:59.919
Remember? You made
a little mess on your tum-tum?

21:59.952 --> 22:02.589
DANNY: I should explain.
Krystal and I had a history.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.927
She used to babysit me
when I was in third grade.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.462
YOUNG KRYSTAL: You were
amazing tonight, Danny.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.432
So well-behaved.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.505
DANNY: After she left,
I did what any
third grader would do.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.648
I pretended
my stuffed lion was
Krystal Manicucci.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.453
And I stroked its cheek.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.856
And I kissed it
oh so tenderly.

22:39.592 --> 22:42.094
Over the years,
our relationship matured.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.797
More grape juice?

22:49.402 --> 22:51.471
I'm really
starting to feel it.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.576
DANNY: And eventually
things intensified.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.655
It was true love.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.460
(MUFFLED WHISTLE SOUND)

FRANK: Look at them.

23:43.990 --> 23:47.159
They're like tiny,
sexy Jeremy Lins,

23:47.193 --> 23:49.428
bouncing that ass
like a basketball.

23:49.462 --> 23:52.164
Right, let's do this.
I get Rachel and
you get Rebecca.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.365
Why do I get Rebecca?

23:53.399 --> 23:54.767
Who cares? They're twins.

23:54.801 --> 23:55.735
All right,
you take Rebecca.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.203
Rebecca's disgusting.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.572
Hey, Rachel.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.541
Gremlin.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.643
We were just admiring
your dope-ass skills.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.311
Maybe we could
play some doubles.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.446
"Doubles?"
Have you ever
played basketball, Frank?

24:07.480 --> 24:10.149
Yeah, I've played
basketball, Rebecca. Okay?

24:11.017 --> 24:12.284
Rachel, you'll be with me,

24:12.318 --> 24:14.821
and Rebecca will
pair up with that
overflowing trash can.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.255
It's a little more
your speed.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.190
REBECCA: Well, I would take
the trash can over you,

24:18.224 --> 24:19.892
based on look and smell.
Great.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.429
Oh, what you got?

24:23.462 --> 24:26.032
Oh, fuck.
It's an actual biker.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.968
That guys looks like
he has a tattoo of Satan
on his 12-inch dick.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.803
LEO: I catch her
with that asshole,
I'll kill them both.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.210
LEO: What the fuck?
(ALL EXCLAIM)

24:38.978 --> 24:40.379
Holy shit!

24:40.412 --> 24:41.681
LEO: Son of a bitch!

24:41.714 --> 24:43.349
RACHEL: Danny.
Run, run, run.

24:43.382 --> 24:46.352
Hey, kid!
Did you just hit me
with that basketball?

24:46.385 --> 24:48.054
I swear, it was an accident.
I promise.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.322
Accident, my ass!
The basket's over there!

24:50.356 --> 24:51.758
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

24:51.791 --> 24:53.059
What's your name?
Danny Campbell.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.961
53 Highland Lane.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.697
In the future, you be
a little more careful.
All right?

24:57.730 --> 24:59.065
And your fat
little friend's a rat.

25:06.372 --> 25:10.042
You know, a rat is actually
one of the smartest
creatures on earth.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.044
So I'm pretty sure
he was paying me a compliment.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.146
Yeah? And what about
when he called you fat?

25:14.180 --> 25:15.882
Uh, I'm pretty sure
he called me "flat",

25:15.915 --> 25:17.216
as in flat-chested,
which I am.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.017
KRYSTAL: Hey, Danny.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.520
Oh, shit.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.724
You are Danny Campbell,
right?

25:26.058 --> 25:27.827
Dr. Campbell's son?

25:27.860 --> 25:29.061
I'm Krystal.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.263
Manicucci.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.933
I used to babysit you.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.002
Oh, yeah.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.237
Yeah, right.
Sorry. Of course. Krystal.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.106
Yeah, I think
I remember you.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.609
I've had a lot
of babysitters, but yeah.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.877
I'm Frank Gomes. I'm, uh...

25:48.214 --> 25:49.315
Fresh pepper?

25:50.149 --> 25:51.550
Fresh pepper?

25:52.852 --> 25:54.987
You two enjoy...
Have a good...

25:55.688 --> 25:57.724
Enjoy the meal
that you have.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.594
Uh...
Yeah, I don't
really know him.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.529
(SIGHS)

26:03.562 --> 26:05.231
So, were you
leaving right now?

26:06.098 --> 26:07.634
I could be.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.102
Or I could stay.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.673
I don't really...
I'm flexible, I guess.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.909
Well, if you were
leaving right now,

26:16.943 --> 26:19.646
I was going to ask
if I could get a ride home.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.015
My dad was
supposed to take me,

26:23.049 --> 26:24.851
but he had to take
care of something.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.486
Oh. Yeah. For sure.

26:27.519 --> 26:30.256
I totally could
give you a ride home.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.791
Um, definitely.

26:33.025 --> 26:33.960
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

26:53.646 --> 26:55.314
So, you're going
to Harvard.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.850
Yep, going up to Boston.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.590
Killer wheels,
by the way.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.993
Yeah, it goes
zero to 60 in never.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.137
This is you?

27:18.170 --> 27:19.305
Yeah, this is me.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.740
Hold on.

27:24.944 --> 27:25.978
(SIGHS)

27:27.479 --> 27:29.081
Wow, you have
a really great house.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.384
(CHUCKLES)
Are you kidding me?

27:33.119 --> 27:35.187
It's horrible.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.824
My mom decided
she was going to
start redecorating.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.092
Everything is marble.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.461
Oh, yeah.
And there's a painting
of Frank Sinatra on the cross

27:42.494 --> 27:43.996
like he's Jesus.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.098
That's a really
complicated image.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.000
(CHUCKLES)

27:48.034 --> 27:50.937
Yeah, well, I'm saving up
so I can move out.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.072
And my dad is like,
a legit psychopath.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.141
Really?
Yeah.

27:57.777 --> 27:58.410
Well, thank you.
For the ride.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.079
Yeah.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.281
It was slightly
faster than walking.

28:03.449 --> 28:06.452
(CHUCKLES) That's the name
of my rickshaw company.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.054
"Slightly Faster
Than Walking."

28:08.087 --> 28:08.955
(CHUCKLES)

28:10.322 --> 28:12.859
Oh, hey, maybe I'll
see you at the pool
this weekend.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.761
You know, if you're around.

28:14.794 --> 28:17.196
Uh, yeah. Totally.
I'll be there.

28:18.731 --> 28:20.299
Not going anywhere.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.240
(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)

28:33.712 --> 28:35.714
DAD: And that's why
it's called
"The No Spin Zone".

28:35.748 --> 28:37.349
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.018
He doesn't
put up with it.
Mmm-mmm.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.388
So, are you all packed?

28:42.421 --> 28:44.490
Like, the car's
getting full.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.793
Hey, you know
who I actually saw
earlier today?

28:46.826 --> 28:48.160
Krystal Manicucci.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.062
Remember, she used
to babysit me?

28:50.096 --> 28:52.832
Oh, God. How could we forget?
That girl was crazy.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.067
Thirteen years old
and she already had a tattoo.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.303
DAD: How do you decide
on a tattoo when you're 13?

28:57.336 --> 29:00.572
I mean, if I got
a tattoo when I was 13,
it would be

29:00.606 --> 29:04.476
a tramp stamp of
Popeye right next
to a Chinese symbol

29:04.510 --> 29:07.113
for Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.480
I'm joking.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.716
MOM: Remember the time
she arrived with some guy...

29:10.749 --> 29:14.020
He's older,
and he was stoned on heroin.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.687
Or smack.
Was it smack?

29:15.721 --> 29:17.289
That's the street
name for it, yeah.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.992
And they both came
riding up on a motorcycle.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.162
What's so bad
about a motorcycle?

29:25.164 --> 29:27.033
You want to
ride a motorcycle?

29:27.066 --> 29:30.302
Do you know how
many of my patients
have broken bones

29:30.336 --> 29:31.871
from motorcycle accidents?

29:31.904 --> 29:34.140
How many of them
are in wheelchairs right now?

29:35.441 --> 29:36.408
I don't know. How many?

29:37.143 --> 29:38.244
Several.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.680
Very many.
Mmm-hmm.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.216
Well, if Krystal was so crazy,
why'd you let her babysit me?

29:44.250 --> 29:45.384
(EXCLAIMS)

29:45.417 --> 29:47.719
Because her father's
a psychopath.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.088
You know that they're

29:50.456 --> 29:51.858
Mafia.
Mafia.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.225
MOM: We were afraid if we
didn't hire his daughter,

29:53.259 --> 29:54.793
we were gonna wind up
buried in a landfill

29:54.827 --> 29:56.428
next to Dustin Hoffman.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.529
Well, Jimmy Hoffa.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.499
Well, then who's
the baseball player?

30:01.567 --> 30:02.969
I don't think

30:04.503 --> 30:05.504
anyone.

30:07.406 --> 30:08.407
Anyways, um,

30:09.876 --> 30:11.978
Krystal actually invited me
to a party this weekend.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.380
In Orlando?

30:14.413 --> 30:17.083
(LAUGHING)
Because you're in Disney
with us this weekend, right?

30:18.017 --> 30:20.186
Look, I'm not
saying I'm going.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.921
I'm just saying
I was invited.

30:25.791 --> 30:26.859
Well...

30:29.896 --> 30:33.032
Maybe you can ride there
on a motorcycle.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.054
Hey, maybe I'll
see you at the pool
this weekend.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.859
Yes! Bump! Yes!

31:00.893 --> 31:03.595
Danny, I'm so happy
you are staying.

31:03.629 --> 31:07.766
This is going to be
the best last weekend ever.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.402
No one can touch us.
We're never gonna die.

31:10.436 --> 31:11.803
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on,

31:11.837 --> 31:13.039
for, like, two seconds here.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.240
Danny.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.842
Krystal Manicucci
brought you back

31:16.875 --> 31:19.778
to her house and
you didn't bang that?

31:19.811 --> 31:21.847
(SCOFFS) This is the shit
I'm talking about.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.950
Fucking Irish guys, man.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.085
MARY ELLEN: Okay.
Can we focus on the party?

31:26.118 --> 31:28.520
Or, like, anything
that will keep
you from talking?

31:28.554 --> 31:29.956
Anything. Truly.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.058
Okay, counterpoint.
Chuck said that

31:32.091 --> 31:33.525
he would fire us
if we threw a party.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.495
Also, Chuck took my keys.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.431
Also, one of his balls
popped out of his Speedo,

31:39.465 --> 31:41.667
and he tried to
tuck it back in
like nothing happened.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.635
Bullshit.
SKOOTCH: Not bullshit.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.804
I saw the freaking thing.
It looked like a peach pit.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.673
FRANK: I'm not doubting
that, Skootch.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.909
Bullshit about getting fired.
We are having a party.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.578
Oh, got it.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.213
I'm in.
Yeah, I'm totally in.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.482
Okay, well, yeah,
I'm obviously in, too. So...

31:57.283 --> 31:58.150
Mary Ellen?

31:59.451 --> 32:01.087
CHUCK OVER PA:
Attention, everyone.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.389
Could one of the lifeguards
report to the pool deck,

32:03.422 --> 32:05.691
where you're paid
to be lifeguards?

32:05.724 --> 32:09.195
TTYO, guys. Thanks a lot.
Hope the summer's
kicking butt.

32:10.629 --> 32:11.964
Well, you heard the man.

32:14.833 --> 32:16.368
Let's get to work.
Yeah.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.236
(WHISTLES)

32:18.237 --> 32:19.205
Whoo!

32:19.238 --> 32:20.439
(WHISTLING CONTINUES)

32:20.472 --> 32:21.307
FRANK: Oh, God!

32:23.809 --> 32:25.511
All right.
Now, the first thing
that we need is alcohol.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.147
Lots of it.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.150
I would buy it,
but I make, like,
$300 a year.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.752
And I spend,
like, $400 on weed, so...

32:33.785 --> 32:34.920
I got this.
All right?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.555
Everybody just
owe me 50 bucks.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.357
I'll pick up
everything we need.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.159
MARY ELLEN: No, I'm not
giving you 50 bucks.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.793
Where are you
getting alcohol?

32:41.827 --> 32:44.863
Relax. I can get us a deal.
I know a guy.

32:44.896 --> 32:47.866
You know a guy? Who are you,
fucking Pablo Escobar?

32:47.899 --> 32:49.501
No run...
Or do.
I don't care.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.003
People are
gonna be hungry, too,

32:51.037 --> 32:52.438
so we should
definitely get snacks.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.541
Snacks, huh? Hey, Frank,
how's that diet going, huh?

32:55.574 --> 32:58.577
Diet's going great.
I ate kale out of your
mom's pussy last night.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.246
DANNY: Guys, we're
a team. Right?

33:00.279 --> 33:02.314
Frank and I will handle
the snacks and mixers.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.016
Go.
ANTHONY: Yeah, right,
whatever. Just make sure

33:04.050 --> 33:05.584
you get a little prosciut'
and some mozzarel'.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.620
Wait. A little what?

33:08.654 --> 33:12.824
I'm so sorry, did you mean
prosciutto and mozzarella?

33:12.858 --> 33:14.960
I say it the authentic
Italian way, okay?

33:14.993 --> 33:18.130
Oh, okay. So when you go
to a Mexican restaurant,
do you ask for

33:18.164 --> 33:20.832
"Give me a burrit' and
a little guacamol'."

33:20.866 --> 33:22.234
No, you don't do that.
You're an idiot.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.836
You have no respect
for my culture.

33:24.870 --> 33:27.139
More importantly,
how are we supposed to
get in without a key?

33:28.174 --> 33:29.708
I'll tell you how.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.647
What? We're not
sharing a secret. Go.

33:35.681 --> 33:39.251
Because Chuck wears a Speedo,
he always leaves his keys
in the office.

33:40.786 --> 33:41.653
But

33:43.489 --> 33:46.492
he doesn't get
out of the office
for more than 20 minutes.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.495
Which is how long it takes
to make a full sweep
of the premises.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.664
Except for one time.

33:52.698 --> 33:56.468
Every day,
at exactly 3:25 p.m...
(WRISTWATCH BEEPING)

33:57.936 --> 34:01.006
Toilet,
I apologize in advance.

34:01.039 --> 34:04.476
...when Chuck moves
his perfectly
regulated bowels.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.348
When Chuck goes
to the bathroom,

34:09.380 --> 34:11.183
Chuck stays in the bathroom.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.152
And we make a copy
of the key.

34:16.788 --> 34:17.688
(CHUCKLES)

34:18.389 --> 34:19.925
Wow.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.460
That thing is awesome.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.661
Home Depot.

Nah, I think we're good, man.
But thank you.

56:14.004 --> 56:15.506
Yeah, I wanna make you
an ice sculpture.

56:17.041 --> 56:19.009
Oh, no, you don't have to,
man. I think we'll be okay.

56:19.043 --> 56:20.811
We're gonna have, like,
booze and weed and stuff.

56:20.845 --> 56:22.379
I'll make you one.

56:22.413 --> 56:25.616
We don't need an ice
sculpture. It's summer.
It'll melt pretty fast.

56:25.650 --> 56:27.952
Huh?
It's ice, so it'll melt.
So we don't...

56:27.985 --> 56:29.119
So you want one?
No.

56:29.720 --> 56:30.721
Yeah.

56:32.790 --> 56:34.459
Hey, did you see
the giant new hornets' nest?

56:35.325 --> 56:37.261
Where?
Yeah, over the shed.

56:37.294 --> 56:38.796
What?
WENDELL: Holy shit.

56:38.829 --> 56:40.364
Yeah. You might wanna
take care of that, man.

56:40.397 --> 56:41.532
They're breeding
like crazy.

56:41.566 --> 56:43.133
Come on, little man,
we got some work to do.

56:43.167 --> 56:44.334
Move out of the way, yeah.

56:44.368 --> 56:45.302
(CHUCKLING) Watch it.
Very flammable.

56:45.335 --> 56:46.671
(MUTTERS)

56:46.704 --> 56:48.606
Can I come to the party, too?

56:48.639 --> 56:50.074
We'll see.
I only get a plus one.

56:51.709 --> 56:52.910
Yo.

56:52.943 --> 56:55.946
Will Hunting,
this is disgusting.

56:55.980 --> 56:57.948
All right. Come on.
Quit your dog shopping.

56:57.982 --> 56:59.484
Chuck's at lunch.
It's game time. All right?

56:59.517 --> 57:01.752
I'm out today.

57:01.786 --> 57:03.754
All right, man.
You're gonna
miss all the action.

57:05.956 --> 57:09.994
I'm telling you,
Osama Bin Laden
had this dog. Right?

57:10.027 --> 57:12.429
Best friend in
the entire fucking world.

57:12.463 --> 57:14.699
And our military
was able to go in,

57:14.732 --> 57:17.635
kidnap the dog,
bring it back to the US,

57:17.668 --> 57:19.904
teach the motherfucker
how to speak English,

57:19.937 --> 57:24.208
and that's how
they found out where
Osama Bin Laden was hiding.

57:24.241 --> 57:25.375
What, you don't believe me?

57:25.409 --> 57:27.812
Okay, I can do this.

57:27.845 --> 57:30.781
This is easy.
Frank Gomes, drug buyer.
I can do this.

57:31.882 --> 57:32.783
Hey.

57:33.818 --> 57:35.486
Can you guys
get out of here?

57:36.386 --> 57:39.389
Sorry. Could you please leave?
Thank you.

57:39.423 --> 57:41.592
That looks good.
Enjoy your juice.

57:42.192 --> 57:43.193
Hey, uh,

57:43.828 --> 57:44.695
Konko.

57:45.295 --> 57:46.564
That's a cool name, man.

57:46.597 --> 57:48.499
Is that Eastern European?

57:49.166 --> 57:50.200
So you sell,

57:50.601 --> 57:53.337
mmm, drugs?

57:53.370 --> 57:54.972
Oh, because I'm black,
I sell drugs.

57:55.005 --> 57:57.041
No. I did not say that.

57:57.074 --> 57:58.876
I heard a rumor
that all ice cream men,

57:58.909 --> 58:00.811
regardless of race,
sold drugs.

58:00.845 --> 58:02.179
I'm just going off...
(CHUCKLES)

58:02.212 --> 58:04.081
Relax, dude.
I'm just messing
with you. All right?

58:04.114 --> 58:05.516
Okay.

58:05.550 --> 58:06.584
Yeah, I can
get you some.
(SIGHS)

58:06.617 --> 58:08.085
What you want? Crack?

58:08.118 --> 58:09.486
Crack? No. Not crack.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.155
No, no, no, no.
I just want some weed.

58:11.188 --> 58:12.523
You know, weed.

58:12.557 --> 58:14.559
Bitch, do I look
like I sell crack?
No.

58:14.592 --> 58:16.260
How dumb do you
think I am, huh?

58:16.293 --> 58:18.596
You have your own business.
You're not dumb.
You're a smart guy.

58:18.629 --> 58:20.397
You want green,
right?
Yeah.

58:20.430 --> 58:22.767
All right,
let's go, get in.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.169
Your truck? I only got five
minutes on break, man. I...

58:25.202 --> 58:27.071
We'll only be gone a minute.

58:27.104 --> 58:29.406
Like an actual
60-second minute,
or like,

58:29.439 --> 58:32.009
you know, "Wassup, homie,
haven't seen you
in a minute" minute?

58:32.042 --> 58:33.911
Now get your simple ass
in the truck, man.

58:33.944 --> 58:37.181
I'll get in the truck.
I'll get in the truck.

58:37.214 --> 58:40.651
All right,
give me your parents' money.
Let's go, guys.

58:40.685 --> 58:43.588
Whoa, Sofia, high roller.
Where did you get this?

58:43.621 --> 58:45.055
I don't want to know.

58:45.089 --> 58:49.326
Bets are closed, guys.
Two to one odds
on Mikey Calcags.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.095

You got this.

58:54.665 --> 58:56.967
Hey, I'm looking
for Chuck Casino.

58:57.001 --> 58:59.003
Oh, not now, man.
We got deck races going on.

58:59.036 --> 59:00.337
Hey, you want in?

59:00.370 --> 59:02.072
Hey, and by the way,
my kid is a lock.

59:02.106 --> 59:03.674
I sprinkled some Adderall
on his chicken fingers.

59:03.708 --> 59:05.509
All right,
let's see them guns.

59:05.542 --> 59:08.613
All right, remember
the rules. You stay
within the glass bottles.

59:08.646 --> 59:11.348
First one to dive
into the shallow end wins.

59:11.381 --> 59:12.850

blood in the pool,

59:37.808 --> 59:39.777
it looked like
the Kool-Aid Man
killed himself.

59:39.810 --> 59:41.011
Like he caught
his wife cheating.

59:41.045 --> 59:42.847
Like he came home
and he was like,

about everything.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:02.566

What are you doing here?

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.069
Is this some sort of
surprise inspection?

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.937
Are you
Chuck Casino?
Yeah.

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:09.106
You called me.

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.308

I did. I forgot.

KONKO: I told you not
to touch anything.

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:25.322
Can we turn
on the music?
No.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:27.925
The pH level is a five.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.027

ain't bad.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.261
It's out of 14.

And yes, it is bad.
It's worse than urine.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.465

Yeah. What a shame.

It's Frank.

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:48.624
All I know is that
I've got a lady situation
that's exploding right now.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.192
And your whole
"Where's Danny?" routine

01:28:50.225 --> 01:28:51.727
is just not
working for me.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.529
I have to go
fucking deal with her.
Get the fuck back.

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:54.663
Whoa, whoa.
I'm right here.

01:28:54.697 --> 01:28:55.864
Okay, Danny's
right here.

01:28:55.898 --> 01:28:57.332
I got your message.

01:28:57.366 --> 01:29:00.135
You thought you were
sending it to her, but
you sent it to me instead.

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:01.370
Mr. Manicucci...

Mr. Manicucci...

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:06.341
I don't know
what you think my intentions
are for your daughter,

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:07.943
but I swear
I am a gentleman.

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:09.344
You're a gentleman?

01:29:09.378 --> 01:29:12.347
You text her
a picture of your dick.

01:29:12.381 --> 01:29:15.083
What? Why would I send you
a picture of a dick?

01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:16.685
I would never...
Look at this.

01:29:16.719 --> 01:29:19.955
Dad, stop.
He would never
send that to me.

01:29:19.988 --> 01:29:22.791
Okay. We're gonna settle this
once and for all right now.

01:29:22.825 --> 01:29:24.693
We'll find out
whose picture this is.

Rebecca! Rebecca!

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:45.914
Go back to partying.

01:29:46.449 --> 01:29:48.150
That's correct.

Teenagers, please
resume your drinking.

01:29:52.187 --> 01:29:53.388

Hey, Leo.

01:30:16.645 --> 01:30:19.014
How's your daughter?

01:30:19.047 --> 01:30:21.149
Come on.
We're gonna go
for a little ride, Chuck.

01:30:21.183 --> 01:30:22.751
Yeah, hop in.

01:30:22.985 --> 01:30:24.019
Oh.

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:27.590
I call shotgun then,
all right, boys?

01:30:27.623 --> 01:30:29.858
Look at you two.
You smell great.

01:30:29.892 --> 01:30:30.826
Dad.

01:30:31.694 --> 01:30:33.061
What are you doing?

01:30:35.297 --> 01:30:36.765
Make sure you have her home
by midnight.

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:43.772
He's just kidding.

01:30:43.806 --> 01:30:44.973
I don't have to
be home till 1:00.

01:30:48.511 --> 01:30:49.978
CHUCK: Hey, guys,
you guys got to see my dick.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:53.916
Hey. Do you want to maybe,

01:30:54.883 --> 01:30:56.952
I don't know,
go somewhere else?

01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.187
Yeah.

01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:00.222
FRANK: Rebecca.

01:31:01.924 --> 01:31:02.791
Rebecca.

01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:07.362
Rebecca, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:09.097
Okay? I'm really sorry.

01:31:09.765 --> 01:31:11.233
Ow!

01:31:11.266 --> 01:31:12.868
Okay, I deserved that.

01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:13.802
Okay.

01:31:14.737 --> 01:31:15.938
I also deserved that.

01:31:16.905 --> 01:31:19.374
Aah! Okay, no one
deserves that. Oh, man.

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.544
Being a twin sucks.
You know that?

01:31:21.577 --> 01:31:23.411
Yes. I understand
what it's like

01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:25.213
to be compared
to other people.

01:31:25.247 --> 01:31:27.750
Being fat sucks, too.

01:31:27.783 --> 01:31:29.718
So does staying home
from college,

01:31:29.752 --> 01:31:31.253
especially when
your best friend's
going to Harvard.

01:31:34.657 --> 01:31:36.291
You're not fat.

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:39.227
And you're really,
really beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

01:31:40.763 --> 01:31:43.465
And I did think
you were Rachel at first.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:44.567
But I'm really
happy you're not.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.702
And honestly,

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:50.706
I feel really lucky that
I even got to kiss you.

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:52.675
Honestly?

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.886
A thousand percent.

01:32:06.889 --> 01:32:09.558
I'm really hungry.
Could we go back
to the party?

01:32:09.592 --> 01:32:11.827
(LAUGHING) Yeah, let's go.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:15.263
Rachel...

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:17.399
I'm joking.

01:32:17.432 --> 01:32:18.567
You better be joking.

01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:35.918
Danny, this is beautiful.

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:38.420
My dad used to
take me here

01:32:38.453 --> 01:32:40.122
when I was little
to look at the stars,

01:32:40.155 --> 01:32:42.390
but you can't really see them
because of the city.

01:32:42.424 --> 01:32:43.759
So he convinced me that

01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:46.595
all the lights on the bridge
were little stars
strung together.

01:32:47.696 --> 01:32:50.065
Wait, um, how old
were you again?

01:32:51.233 --> 01:32:52.768
This is like
a week ago.

01:32:56.038 --> 01:32:59.141
You're kind of funny,
for a kid who's
going to Harvard.

01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:03.145
I'm a little jealous.

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:04.947
At least you're
getting out of here.

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.982
You're doing
something exciting
with your life.

01:33:07.015 --> 01:33:10.653
And I would kill
to get off this island.

01:33:10.686 --> 01:33:12.955
You can't leave.
You're the Queen
of Staten Island.

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:17.125
Do you know how
horrible that sounds?
(LAUGHS)

01:33:17.159 --> 01:33:19.895
I mean, would you
want to be the
King of New Jersey?

01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:21.997
I would, but they keep
electing Bruce Springsteen.

01:33:28.871 --> 01:33:31.840
I feel like you're
the kind of girl

01:33:31.874 --> 01:33:33.308
who wants to marry me,
but not kiss me.

01:33:38.013 --> 01:33:41.950
Well, I feel like
you're the kind of guy
that wants to kiss me,

01:33:41.984 --> 01:33:44.052
but doesn't
want to marry me.

01:33:46.689 --> 01:33:50.358
What if we pretended to be
different kinds of people
for one night?

01:33:55.063 --> 01:33:56.031
Okay.

01:34:11.013 --> 01:34:14.416
You know we're not
having sex, right?

01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:17.152
Oh, I couldn't.
I'd be thinking about
your dad the whole time.

01:34:18.453 --> 01:34:20.088
That's disgusting.

I got something for you.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.442
What? Seriously?

01:35:14.476 --> 01:35:16.178
Yeah, you earned it, man.

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:19.214
I mean, even a boner rescue
is technically a save.

01:35:20.749 --> 01:35:22.084
Besides, when
Victor kills Chuck,

01:35:22.117 --> 01:35:24.186
you could totally
work here again
next summer.

What are you gonna do?

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:38.233
Probably just
gonna stroll home.

anyone at Harvard
you're from Staten Island.
