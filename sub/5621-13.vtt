<i>You're watching</i> The Grinder.

- For justice?
- For justice!

<i>Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays,</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.380
This is Edie,
your granddaughter.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.986 --> 00:20.486
It's over, Sebastian.
You're going to death row.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.489
Put me on the stand.
I told you, that is suicide.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.824
SEBASTIAN: Put me on the stand!

00:25.826 --> 00:28.060
I<i> begged</i> you to take that deal!

00:28.062 --> 00:31.230
The Grinder I used to
know didn't take deals.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.966
He<i> made</i> deals and won cases.

00:33.968 --> 00:37.636
In law school, they teach you
one very important thing:

00:37.638 --> 00:40.839
Always keep one in the chamber.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.575
Well, I've got bad news.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.045
Click, click. SEBASTIAN: Wow.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.647
I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.316
What did you just say?

00:51.318 --> 00:53.719
Never thought I'd live
to see the day.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.990
And the victim never thought
<i>he</i> would live to see this day.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.358
Guard! GUARD: Open the gate!

00:59.360 --> 01:00.592
Get Judge Jimenez!

01:00.594 --> 01:03.929
We've got one last witness
to call.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.098
Right there. See that?

01:06.100 --> 01:07.833
No, I-I wasn't watching,
uh, since this is

01:07.835 --> 01:09.868
apparently what we do
every night now.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.337
So you missed the "What did you just say?"
moment. I don't know what that means.

01:12.339 --> 01:13.939
What's the
"What did you just say?" moment.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.941
Well, the murder had
to have happened at night,

01:15.943 --> 01:17.376
which means
my client is innocent.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.744
But there was no way for me

01:18.746 --> 01:20.212
to put it all together

01:20.214 --> 01:22.047
until Sebastian Cole
uttered that phrase.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.883
Woven together so nicely.
So smart. I mean, wow.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.920
So you needed to hear
the word "day" to...

01:27.922 --> 01:29.521
To trigger the entire solution.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.557
I mean, I honestly thought
you were gonna lose.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.425
I thought you were gonna win
like you do every time.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.394
You<i> thought</i> I was gonna win,
but you didn't know.

01:35.396 --> 01:38.030
Yeah, you couldn't have
possibly seen that coming.

01:38.032 --> 01:40.099
Uh, well, buddy, I-I actually
think you can see it coming

01:40.101 --> 01:41.633
'cause The Grinder never loses.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.634
But he can. But he doesn't.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.769
But he could. But he won't?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.604
Not on my watch.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.941
¶ ¶

01:51.212 --> 01:52.911
So, our client is owed several
weeks' back pay. All right.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.980
So let's subpoena
the payroll records and move on.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.216
Or... Oh, that's perfect timing.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.884
We don't play by their rules.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.252
Well, that sounds intriguing.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.154
Uh, no, Dad,
it's not intriguing.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.389
And, Dean, it's not their rules.
It's the law.

02:04.391 --> 02:07.226
Yeah, look, we could subpoena
their financial records.

02:07.228 --> 02:10.295
We could get some information.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.331
But it would make us
look desperate.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.567
Or does it make it look like
they have something to hide?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.635
Oh, my God, what's happening?

02:16.637 --> 02:17.769
Timothy Olyphant.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.005
Oh. You're here, at my job.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.174
You're not welcome here, son.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.642
No, Dad.
You know what? It's okay.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.611
I got this. Let me guess.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.613
You're on a hiatus week
from the show,

02:27.615 --> 02:29.982
and you've come back again
to see your girl.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.850
Yeah. That's what I thought.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.485
That's what we<i> all</i> thought.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.187
Yeah, maybe you should
wait for me outside.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.955
Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.690
I shouldn't be talking
in your meeting.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.592
Yeah, that's right,
because we're talking about

02:40.594 --> 02:41.827
real legal stuff,

02:41.829 --> 02:43.695
not fake TV legal stuff.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.330
You do know
there's a difference, right?

02:45.332 --> 02:47.533
But do you?
Because you're both...

02:47.535 --> 02:49.268
Yeah, Claire, we get it.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.436
We're both just
TV lawyers to you.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.038
To everybody. To everybody!

02:53.040 --> 02:54.540
Well, unlike my counterpart,

02:54.542 --> 02:56.208
I've never lost a case.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.177
He's already blown a huge one
in episode three!

02:58.179 --> 02:59.978
Uh, I had a professor
in law school that said,

02:59.980 --> 03:01.547
"You're not really a lawyer

03:01.549 --> 03:04.069
<i>until</i> you've lost
your first case."

03:05.319 --> 03:07.853
Sorry, I don't... I don't know
why I weighed in on that one.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.223
Oh, I didn't mean to step
on anyone's toes, buddy.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.058
If we hadn't just done
an episode about it,

03:13.060 --> 03:14.393
I wouldn't even be chiming in.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.061
Hang on, everybody.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.197
Timothy's just done
an episode about it.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.865
Please enlighten us.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.667
Well, what I was just saying is,

03:21.669 --> 03:24.536
the way we did it was
first we called their bluff.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.972
Uh-huh. And then we filed
for what's called...

03:26.974 --> 03:30.142
If I remember correctly...
A tecum injunction?

03:30.144 --> 03:31.543
No. STEWART: Yes, actually.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.145
Uh, close, Tim.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.846
It's a duces tecum subpoena.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.815
That's it. That's weird.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.350
That could actually
help us here.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.819
Yeah. Good job, babe.
STEWART: Thank you, Tim.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.853
If it helps, yeah, use it.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.589
My gift to you, huh?

03:45.025 --> 03:46.725
DEAN: <i>It's-it's crazy.</i>

03:46.727 --> 03:49.161
The guy has done four episodes.
Now he thinks he's a lawyer.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.663
Really outrageous.
It's embarrassing.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.931
I mean, he must be
a crazy person.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.833
I love that
you think this is insane.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.535
Stew, you're telling me that
an actor who's played a part

03:56.537 --> 03:58.103
for four weeks has
the same amount of experience

03:58.105 --> 04:00.038
as a guy who's played the part
for eight years?

04:00.040 --> 04:02.174
I think someone without a
law degree is just as qualified

04:02.176 --> 04:04.042
as someone else who also
doesn't have a law degree.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.278
Okay, say you're choking
to death in a movie theater.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.780
Two rows behind you
sits Anthony Edwards.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.249
Please, Dean. I do not want to
have this conversation with you.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.917
It's a totally different
argument this time.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.620
The row in front of you
sits Goran Visnjic.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.755
Dean.
A man who also played a doctor

04:16.757 --> 04:19.625
on that same show, but only at
the end, when they weren't even

04:19.627 --> 04:21.126
telling medically-driven
stories anymore.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.127
Yeah, and that's when
they lost me.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.629
So I ask you.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.063
In whose hands
would you put your life?

04:25.065 --> 04:25.931
LIZZIE: I'll take Edwards.

04:25.933 --> 04:26.898
All day long.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.267
Yeah, I mean,

04:28.269 --> 04:30.202
given the very specific
parameters...

04:30.204 --> 04:31.570
I would have to choose Edwards.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.438
I agree with the family.
Edwards, of course.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.975
So in the<i> Grinder</i> universe,
is it not true

04:36.977 --> 04:39.244
(voice distorting, fading): That
I would be the uber-qualified

04:39.246 --> 04:41.113
Anthony Edwards
to Tim Olyphant's

04:41.115 --> 04:43.615
vastly inexperienced
Goran Visnjic?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.784
In whose hands would you...?

04:45.786 --> 04:49.621
Really? You want him
to come by the office more?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.223
If he wants. You
know, just to maybe

04:51.225 --> 04:52.791
learn some stuff about the show.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.959
Oh, I see what you're doing.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.127
What am I doing? No, I like it.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.295
You do? It's good.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.929
Good, 'cause this was
gonna be exhausting.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.731
Yeah. Trying to be the
back-and-forth thing.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.099
Yeah, my only hesitation is

05:01.101 --> 05:03.101
that Tim's been
kind of clingy lately,

05:03.103 --> 05:05.103
so I don't know that spending
more time with him would be...

05:05.105 --> 05:06.772
No, I totally get it,
but this is...

05:06.774 --> 05:07.973
No, a great opportunity,
you're right.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.608
And we don't need him a lot.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.343
You know,
maybe he does a couple pop-ins,

05:11.345 --> 05:13.078
you know, two, three chime-ins,
that's it.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.313
Okay. I'll call him. You know?

05:14.315 --> 05:16.875
Okay, good. Thank you.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.584
Stew, you mind if
I cut out early?

05:19.586 --> 05:22.187
I got the election coming up,
and I got to set up the room.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.190
The room? Yeah, the Matterhorn
Room at the Boise Garden Suites.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.426
And we do what now? Claire,
this is the president

05:27.428 --> 05:29.261
of the Boise Valley Senior
Fishing Society. Come on.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.430
Stan Grady's gunning
for my chair.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.498
Dad, we will be there, because
if something is important

05:33.500 --> 05:36.635
to one of us, it's important
to every damn one of us.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.670
And we don't question that.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.772
Mornin'. Oh, come on!

05:40.774 --> 05:43.642
Please, continue.
I am a fly on the wall.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.976
Wait. He's sitting now?

05:44.978 --> 05:46.545
Yeah, he-he just
came to observe.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.714
Remember that you said
that you wanted to, uh...?

05:48.716 --> 05:51.850
Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, I thought
it would be good for the...

05:51.852 --> 05:53.985
For the role? Exactly.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.120
Yeah, yeah, and, plus,

05:55.122 --> 05:56.488
you know, I'm gonna be
in town now

05:56.490 --> 05:58.023
every week hanging
with Claire, so...

05:58.025 --> 05:59.224
Wait. What? Every week?

05:59.226 --> 06:00.325
Well, since we're getting
more serious,

06:00.327 --> 06:01.727
I worked it out with the show.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.795
They're gonna film
all my scenes Monday

06:03.797 --> 06:05.464
through Wednesday, so
I can be here the rest.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.733
Oh. That's great.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.470
This is absurd.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.571
I should probably
go talk to him.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.072
No.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.041
(sighs)

06:16.043 --> 06:18.377
This one's on me, guys.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.581
Dean, wait.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.417
Tim, what do you want?

06:25.419 --> 06:27.018
I just want to learn.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.653
Don't overthink it.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.255
The shows a hit, people love it,
critics love it.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.324
Not my biggest critic.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.727
Yourself.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.100
I'm just acting.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.170
I'm not inhabiting
the damn role.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.372
I'm on that set,
I'm saying my lines,

06:47.374 --> 06:48.940
but I don't believe myself.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.076
Does the audience?
Sure. Every time.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.577
But not me.

06:52.579 --> 06:56.181
If acting were easy,
we wouldn't be doing it.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.283
We're junkies for the challenge.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.585
Look, I've only caught a couple
of episodes<i> of NOLA...</i>

07:00.587 --> 07:02.854
Mm-hmm.
But what I have noticed is,

07:02.856 --> 07:04.856
when you're playing anger,
you're doing a lot

07:04.858 --> 07:06.291
(shouts): Of yelling!

07:06.293 --> 07:07.692
On the jury box

07:07.694 --> 07:09.294
like this!

07:09.296 --> 07:11.596
That sells outrage, yes. Yeah.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.232
But what if you brought
it all down here

07:14.234 --> 07:16.735
(whispering): And let the words
play the emotion? Down here?

07:16.737 --> 07:18.036
Yes. Yeah, this feels dangerous.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.204
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

07:19.206 --> 07:21.072
I could explode any moment.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.974
Not at any moment.
The explosion has to...

07:22.976 --> 07:24.743
(shouts): Cut against the beat!

07:24.745 --> 07:27.145
(shouting continues)

07:27.147 --> 07:28.580
This is gonna be fun.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.215
It's already fun.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.222
It's on. Show it to me.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.291
Then you take it off
in one fell swoop.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.559
You have to show it to me again,
'cause I didn't

07:40.561 --> 07:42.060
even see it
'cause it hardly happened.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.229
Let me give it a shot. I mean,
I'm gonna make it my own.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.897
But you know what I mean?
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.568
Hey, uh, Dean, Tim.
Uh, what are you guys doing?

07:49.570 --> 07:52.070
I'm just teaching Tim some tricks
of the trade. Hello, Counselor.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.573
Oh, yes! Exactly like that.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.241
You guys are f... are friends
then now? You're not...

07:56.243 --> 07:57.242
I thought you were fighting.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.743
You guys were
so mad at each other.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.312
Nah. Tim and I had
a little chat,

08:00.314 --> 08:02.514
and I realized
something very important.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.782
I'm The Grinder, Mm-hmm.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.317
But he's The Grinder's brother.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.418
Which means I should
be teaching him

08:06.420 --> 08:08.987
everything I know
about life, love

08:08.989 --> 08:10.422
and the law.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.023
Yeah, that's nice of you to do
for your brother.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.593
The better I am, the
better the show is.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.027
Right? I mean, it's
better for everyone.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.797
Ooh, T.O., what do you say
we go into the courtroom,

08:18.799 --> 08:21.099
I show you how to hop on
the jury box.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.969
OLYPHANT: Take it easy, Stew.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.137
Yeah, you're gonna see me in,
like, two seconds, Tim.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.473
I'm following you.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.141
<i>Your Honor, we would like</i>

08:30.143 --> 08:31.977
to dismiss juror number four.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.312
Ooh. Oh, uh, Your Honor, um,
a motion to hang on a sec.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.014
Guys, what are you doing?
One second.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.682
(whispering)

08:37.684 --> 08:40.719
No, we like her. We think
she's got an honest face.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.521
What? It's normal.
It's a regular face.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.655
Plus, she's wearing

08:43.657 --> 08:45.557
a cross around her neck.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.560
The non-fanatical religious
are always less likely to...

08:48.562 --> 08:50.128
BOTH: Send someone to the chair.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.329
ADAMS: Uh, Mr. Sanderson,

08:51.331 --> 08:52.831
as much as I like
watching the process here,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.733
I could use an answer
on juror number four.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.034
Uh, yes. Apologies, Your Honor.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.736
We would still like
to excuse her.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.838
Can't lead a horse to water.
Mm-mm.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.006
(sighs)

09:01.008 --> 09:03.008
STEWART: <i>Now there's two of 'em.</i>

09:03.010 --> 09:04.476
Yeah, no, I was counting.
And they're, like,

09:04.478 --> 09:05.744
in love with each other, honey.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.245
I mean,
how-how does that happen?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.547
Well, pretty sure
you brought that on yourself.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.215
Yeah, I know. I was just trying

09:10.217 --> 09:11.883
to give him a little taste
of what it was like.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.685
Right.
And now I would kill to go back

09:13.687 --> 09:15.353
to having just one actor
at the firm.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.855
Why don't you turn them
against each other?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.223
I'm listening. Well, I mean,

09:18.225 --> 09:20.025
they're both used to being
the star, right?

09:20.027 --> 09:23.028
So why don't you just remind
them of that and...

09:23.030 --> 09:24.763
let them destroy each other?

09:24.765 --> 09:26.531
Oh, hon, that's dark.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.399
Yeah?

09:27.401 --> 09:29.321
But awesome. Right?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.102
Yes.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.705
What could he possibly
be showing him?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.874
I hate him so much.
We got to get him out of here.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.542
Okay. I know. Uh,
follow my lead here.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.545
(clears throat) All right,
let's talk some law.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.246
BOTH: Love to.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.714
Excellent.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.050
So, uh, who do we call
to the stand first?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.218
Dean, you must have
some thoughts on this.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.921
Uh, the daughter.
She's cute, um, not threatening.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.724
People, uh, like her. People aren't
gonna want to see her suffer.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.893
Tim, you got something.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.394
I don't know. You sure?

09:56.396 --> 09:57.929
'Cause it feels like
maybe you were leaning

09:57.931 --> 09:59.631
in a different direction
than Dean.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.133
I was just thinking maybe
we should go after the boss.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.468
It's like prison.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.203
You take down the toughest guy first.
CLAIRE: Huh.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.538
Dean, what-what's
your reaction to that?

10:06.540 --> 10:08.073
Yeah, do you think Tim is wrong?

10:08.075 --> 10:12.077
Uh, well, um, on TV,
uh, y-you would do that.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.145
But real law... and I think
this is maybe where Tim

10:14.147 --> 10:17.816
is a little inexperienced...
Um, much different.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.451
Yeah, I get that. Mm.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.752
I don't know. Is
it that different?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.253
Because on my show...

10:22.255 --> 10:24.255
And maybe this is
where Dean lost his way

10:24.257 --> 10:25.924
a little bit towards the end...

10:25.926 --> 10:27.092
It's about hooking the audience

10:27.094 --> 10:29.160
so that they don't tune out.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.630
All right, I don't like
this arrangement anymore.

10:31.632 --> 10:35.100
Well, hey, bro, maybe you should
talk to your bro about that,

10:35.102 --> 10:37.669
since he's the one
who invited me to shadow him.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.507
Is what Tim Olyphant says true?

10:42.509 --> 10:44.442
Uh, it... uh, it is. It is.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.478
But I feel like... Stop.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.780
I don't need to hear any more.
And I don't know why

10:48.782 --> 10:50.315
I'm teaching you;
You are so far away

10:50.317 --> 10:52.150
from being ready for real law.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.319
We're both actors
who have played lawyers.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.354
We're, like, you know, the same.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.791
What are you even saying? You
have zero real-world experience.

10:59.793 --> 11:03.128
I hate to break it to you, Dean,
but you're not a real lawyer.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.398
You're still just a guy
pretending to be one.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.535
I'm not gonna lie, Tim,
that cut deep.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.671
Probably because
what you're saying is true.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.139
I'm not a real lawyer.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.841
But I'm a hell of a lot closer
to one than you'll ever know.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.310
I'd disagree with that,
but what's the point?

11:19.312 --> 11:20.979
There's no way to settle this.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.480
Uh, what if we, uh,
put it to a vote?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.616
Yeah, yeah.
Whoever's voted less close

11:24.618 --> 11:26.484
to, uh, being a lawyer...

11:26.486 --> 11:27.786
Doesn't come in anymore.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.455
Hmm. I like the stakes.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.123
They feel right.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.560
But a vote won't cut it. Mm-mm.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.896
Let's settle it in court.
Right, guys? What?

11:37.898 --> 11:39.497
Remember back in law school,
we used to have

11:39.499 --> 11:41.166
all those mock trials?

11:41.168 --> 11:43.234
Two students would disagree.
Mock trial.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.670
I've got the Matterhorn Room
at the BG Suites.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.206
I'll just tell the guys to put
the election off for an hour.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.175
But what about your presidency, Dad?
This is more important.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.509
And if something is important

11:51.511 --> 11:53.411
to one of us... It's important

11:53.413 --> 11:55.180
to every damn one of us.
Thank you, Dad.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.681
And we don't question that.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.183
I'm in.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.818
I'm in further.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.187
TODD: Ooh!

12:02.189 --> 12:04.489
Ooh, this is exciting!

12:04.491 --> 12:05.924
Getting away from
us again, right?

12:05.926 --> 12:07.092
Yeah, it might be.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.395
You're gonna help me
win this, right, babe?

12:10.397 --> 12:11.696
'Cause you don't
want me to leave?

12:11.698 --> 12:13.598
Yeah. Sure.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.834
You. Dean, this doesn't
have to be a whole thing.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.402
I can just ask him to leave.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.237
We don't have to have
a fake trial about it.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.039
Well, I wish that were
on the table, but, sadly,

12:21.041 --> 12:23.208
now we do have to have
a fake trial about it.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.410
And only one man can win.
Yes. Can win. Yeah.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.480
I'm glad you understand that. One can win.
Yeah. Just one man. Mm-hmm.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.225
What are we doing here?

12:40.227 --> 12:41.559
This has gotten so out of hand.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.927
Three and a half hours
last night

12:42.929 --> 12:44.763
Tim prepped me
for cross-examination.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.598
And then we have
to stay afterward

12:46.600 --> 12:48.600
for some election we
need your dad to win?

12:48.602 --> 12:50.101
I have no idea what's going on.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.537
I'm Claire, by the way.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.306
Oh. Debbie. It's so weird
that we haven't met.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.574
I know, right?

12:56.576 --> 12:58.243
You're stalling, Senior.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.079
And you expect us to be
the jurors in this nonsense?!

13:01.081 --> 13:02.881
You guys want to vote me out,
vote me out.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.984
Just don't take out your
frustrations with me on my kid.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.220
Gonna have a hard time being
unbiased here, Sanderson.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.423
Okay, so I guess we're having
a mock trial

13:12.425 --> 13:16.427
between Dean Sanderson and
Timothy Olyphant to determine

13:16.429 --> 13:19.097
who's closer to being a lawyer
in real life.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.665
Is that right, guys?

13:20.667 --> 13:21.766
Yes, Your Honor. Cool.

13:21.768 --> 13:22.834
Thanks for helping out, Wes.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.102
You're a lifesaver, sir.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.170
No, thanks for including me
in this.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.437
This is gonna be fun.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.339
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

13:28.341 --> 13:30.675
I am not a real lawyer.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.411
For me to posit that I am one
would be a violation

13:33.413 --> 13:36.748
of my ethical responsibilities
as an attorney.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.652
I am here to prove

13:40.654 --> 13:43.855
that just because a person
is not something

13:43.857 --> 13:46.624
does not mean that he

13:46.626 --> 13:48.493
is not closer

13:48.495 --> 13:53.298
to being the thing he is not
than... another person.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.367
It's easy for some
handsome Hollywood actor

13:56.369 --> 13:58.336
to stand here and say,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.805
"I'm closer to being a lawyer
than he is."

14:00.807 --> 14:02.307
I should know.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.708
Because I am one.

14:04.978 --> 14:08.479
They say an actor lies
for a living.

14:08.481 --> 14:12.383
If that's the case,
who's lied to you less?

14:14.788 --> 14:17.055
(jurors murmuring)

14:17.057 --> 14:20.325
Ms. Lacoste, how many cases
has Timothy Olyphant

14:20.327 --> 14:21.793
won for Sanderson & Yao?

14:21.795 --> 14:24.195
None.
And over the past few months,

14:24.197 --> 14:28.333
how many cases
have I personally won for S&Y?

14:28.335 --> 14:29.801
Also technically none.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.670
I mean, maybe you helped
a little.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.539
Maybe I...

14:34.541 --> 14:36.674
helped... a little.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.676
(chuckles)

14:40.180 --> 14:42.714
Ms. Lacoste,
did you or did you not

14:42.716 --> 14:46.317
tell me while we were alone
together in your bedroom

14:46.319 --> 14:50.855
that my show was more realistic
when it came to law

14:50.857 --> 14:53.024
than<i> The Grinder: Los Angeles?</i>

14:53.026 --> 14:55.026
Objection, Your Honor.
It's<i> The Grinder.</i>

14:55.028 --> 14:57.362
There's no city attached to it
because it's not

14:57.364 --> 14:59.864
a derivative knock-off
looking to cloak itself

14:59.866 --> 15:02.367
in the legacy
of a television institution.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.601
Sustained?

15:03.603 --> 15:04.602
I'll rephrase.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.870
Did you or did you not say

15:05.872 --> 15:07.205
<i>Grinder: NOLA</i> was

15:07.207 --> 15:09.607
more realistic,
from a legal standpoint,

15:09.609 --> 15:11.075
than the West Coast<i> Grinder?</i>

15:11.077 --> 15:12.076
CLAIRE: Yes, I did.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.278
And did you mean it?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.279
No.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.047
Then why did you say it?

15:16.049 --> 15:18.249
I don't know.
I guess I just wanted to, uh...

15:18.251 --> 15:20.051
To get in my pants?
Objection, Your Honor.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.286
No one wants to hear that.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.954
Actually, I do. Shh!

15:22.956 --> 15:24.422
Yes, but is it that bad? I mean,
I thought you were saying

15:24.424 --> 15:25.957
whatever you had to say
to get in my pants.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.959
Objection! Your Honor,
this isn't couples therapy!

15:27.961 --> 15:29.694
No, it is not.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.296
But it is

15:31.298 --> 15:33.231
an expert cross.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.566
Please let the record show
that I got

15:35.568 --> 15:38.836
exactly what I wanted
from this witness.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.940
Now, that's some good lawyering.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.641
(jurors murmuring)

15:46.579 --> 15:47.812
He's losing.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.080
So help him.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.748
How?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.550
Oh, I wasn't prepared
for a follow-up question.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.985
ADAMS: All right.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.220
Let's take a short recess.
Back in 15.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.571
If you've come up here
to give a pep talk,

16:13.573 --> 16:16.140
you should save it
for somebody else.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.276
Okay.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.578
I'll just... I'll
sit on it, then.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.146
Maybe save it for another day.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.481
Where's your protégé?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.483
Dean, he's not my protégé.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.319
Sure seems like it.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.288
He's better than I am.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.489
At what?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.924
All of it.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.525
He's got the show,
he's got the girl,

16:34.527 --> 16:37.628
he's got the jury eating out of
the palm of his hand.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.130
Dean, it's not over yet.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.866
Okay, you tell me.
Put yourself in that box.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.202
You're in that
deliberation room.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.871
Do you really think
I have any chance?

16:48.208 --> 16:50.208
Yeah, what do you care anyway?

16:50.210 --> 16:52.310
You probably want me to lose.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.880
So you and Tim Olyphant
can run the firm together.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.982
Is that what you think I want?

16:57.984 --> 17:00.385
To run the firm
with Timothy Olyphant?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.487
A complete stranger
with even less

17:02.489 --> 17:03.888
TV legal experience than you?

17:03.890 --> 17:05.490
Then what do you want, Stewart?

17:05.492 --> 17:07.225
Maybe you should figure that out
before you come up here

17:07.227 --> 17:09.060
and try to give a pep talk
that isn't working.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.195
Trust me.

17:11.197 --> 17:15.066
There's only one TV lawyer
I want to run this firm with.

17:15.068 --> 17:18.169
If... it has to be that way.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.871
And it's you.

17:19.873 --> 17:24.575
Well, that's
a sweet sentiment...

17:24.577 --> 17:26.677
but it's a pipe dream.

17:26.679 --> 17:30.548
Dean, The Grinder's never lost.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.517
There's no reason he
has to start today.

17:32.519 --> 17:36.187
Thank you for accepting me
into your firm.

17:36.189 --> 17:40.058
You didn't have to do that,
but you did.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.127
And I will always cherish that.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.859
He's gonna put me
on the stand, Dean.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.735
I know.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.937
He's gonna rip you apart.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.239
Humiliate you
in front of your family

17:55.241 --> 17:56.774
and coworkers.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.377
Just tell the truth.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.012
You'll be fine.

18:01.014 --> 18:02.680
Okay.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.950
(door opens, closes)

18:05.952 --> 18:09.454
Boise Garden Suites
has a helipad? Huh.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.227
Mr. Sanderson,
something you said yesterday

18:16.229 --> 18:17.728
really stuck with me.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.397
Quote from an old law professor.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.398
Do you remember that?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.266
No. No, I'm not sure I do.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.267
A lawyer

18:23.269 --> 18:25.103
isn't really a lawyer

18:25.105 --> 18:27.939
until he loses his first case.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.073
Isn't that right?

18:29.075 --> 18:30.408
Uh, yeah.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.742
And in all the cases

18:31.744 --> 18:33.911
your brother's
been involved in...

18:33.913 --> 18:38.316
Both as The Grinder
and here, in, uh, Boise...

18:38.318 --> 18:40.318
How many has he lost?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.152
Um...

18:41.154 --> 18:42.753
(shouts):
Answer... the question,

18:42.755 --> 18:44.455
Mr. Sanderson!

18:44.457 --> 18:45.790
STEWART: Um...

18:45.792 --> 18:47.158
none.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.459
None?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.994
Huh.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.095
That's curious.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.763
I only mention it because

18:52.765 --> 18:57.268
in episode three of
<i>The Grinder: New Orleans,</i>

18:57.270 --> 18:59.303
Rake Grinder,

18:59.305 --> 19:01.606
played by me...

19:01.608 --> 19:03.307
loses...

19:03.309 --> 19:04.942
his first...

19:04.944 --> 19:06.144
case.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.578
Oh, crap.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.447
(jurors murmuring)

19:09.449 --> 19:11.949
No further questions,
Your Honor.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.618
Yours to lose.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.020
What did you just say?

19:16.022 --> 19:17.989
Yours to lose.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.558
Mine to lose.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.496
But not today.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.964
He's got it.
What? How do you know?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.199
Because he just did
the stupid thing

19:28.201 --> 19:29.300
from the show, the repeat.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.636
Mr. Olyphant is right.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.338
I am vastly more experienced.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.841
And that kind
of experience pales

19:36.843 --> 19:39.310
with the experience a lawyer
gets the very first time

19:39.312 --> 19:43.214
he tastes the bitter pill
of defeat.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.517
And so I say to you now,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.719
and maybe for the last time...

19:50.390 --> 19:52.223
The Grinder rests.

19:52.225 --> 19:56.894
And you have no choice
but to find for my opponent.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.263
(jurors murmuring)

20:00.667 --> 20:03.668
You, uh... okay with that, guys?

20:03.670 --> 20:05.536
Eh, yep. Sure. Fine with me.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.073
Then I rule in favor
of Mr. Timothy Olyphant.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.578
And, in so doing,

20:13.580 --> 20:16.747
give me my first taste...

20:16.749 --> 20:19.717
of defeat.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.352
(all murmuring)

20:21.354 --> 20:24.355
Oh, crap. Coupled with my edge
in experience, Your Honor,

20:24.357 --> 20:27.191
I would like to move to reopen
this case and ask the jury

20:27.193 --> 20:29.093
if they would like
to reconsider their verdict.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.561
Okay. Guys?

20:30.563 --> 20:31.529
Yeah. Why not?

20:31.531 --> 20:32.763
ADAMS: Now I rule in favor

20:32.765 --> 20:34.765
of Mr. Dean Sanderson.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.467
(applause)

20:39.505 --> 20:41.239
Is this the stupidest thing
I've ever been a part of?

20:41.241 --> 20:42.506
I think it might be.
It's up there.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.541
I would say.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.876
Congratulations, Counselor.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.778
I did not see that coming. Oh.

20:47.780 --> 20:51.649
Hey, it means a lot
coming from you.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.686
You know...

20:55.688 --> 20:57.555
I'll never be you.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.857
And maybe that's okay.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.772
Guys, thanks for keeping
an open mind.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.474
We'll have the election
in a bit here.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.575
No need.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.410
We know where our vote's going.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.611
What about Stan Grady?

21:20.613 --> 21:21.912
Grady's out.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.115
What do you say? One more term?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.449
I think I can handle that.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.152
(laughter)

21:28.154 --> 21:29.153
You saved me.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.055
When you said
"The Grinder doesn't

21:31.057 --> 21:33.291
have to lose<i> today,"</i>
and then Olyphant says,

21:33.293 --> 21:34.759
"Yours to lose..."

21:34.761 --> 21:35.993
And then you processed that,

21:35.995 --> 21:37.595
and then you said,
"What did you just say?"

21:37.597 --> 21:39.497
And you did both of those things...
No, but...

21:39.499 --> 21:40.965
And then, right there,
it was like you were talking

21:40.967 --> 21:42.767
about the case,
but you were also talking

21:42.769 --> 21:44.168
about the rift between you two.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.270
When you said,
"It did, didn't it?"

21:46.272 --> 21:48.472
Right. We get it. Yeah. Yeah.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.508
W-We got that. Okay, good, good.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.009
Just pointing it out.
