00:20.021 --> 00:24.525
[distorted]
Peacock Motor Court,
possible 10-31.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.008
[Checotah] Get out.
Get, get, get, get.

00:27.108 --> 00:29.110
Get.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.532
[Bell] Save the eyeball.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.774
I am not touching that eyeball.

00:33.874 --> 00:36.257
There's a possibility
that you slit his throat

00:36.357 --> 00:37.618
and the past few hours
was just your...

00:37.718 --> 00:40.381
[normal voice] insane way
of covering things up.

00:40.481 --> 00:41.542
-Checotah.
-Hmm.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.503
-Get the first aid kit.
-Okay.

00:43.603 --> 00:46.446
-I think
he's a little past first aid.
-I know. That's not the point.

00:47.327 --> 00:48.949
-Got it.
-Get the thermometer.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.630
Why? Why, what is this?

00:50.730 --> 00:51.992
We need his body temperature

00:52.092 --> 00:53.753
to establish
when he was killed.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.835
The most accurate reading
will come from his rectum.

00:55.935 --> 00:57.997
-Okay, now
you're just fucking around.
-I am not.

00:58.097 --> 00:59.759
You are a suspect.

00:59.859 --> 01:02.041
Do you wanna solve this or not?

01:02.141 --> 01:04.844
Sorry, I got a latex allergy,

01:04.944 --> 01:06.245
which girls never believe,

01:06.345 --> 01:07.847
but it's why
I always go sheepskin.

01:07.947 --> 01:09.949
I would do it myself, but...

01:11.150 --> 01:13.612
You want me to sing to you
so you're not distracted
by his anus?

01:13.712 --> 01:16.175
If you don't zip it,
I'm gonna stick this
in your nose when I'm done.

01:16.275 --> 01:18.277
Oh, snap. Lady's come to play.

01:19.518 --> 01:21.180
[Bell] Ah, gentle, now.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.781
Ugh.

01:22.881 --> 01:24.883
Now we wait for the beep.

01:29.728 --> 01:32.270
-Jeremiah Cedar.
-[Checotah] Never heard of him.

01:32.370 --> 01:35.073
Ironic that
my wife's dead lover
was named for a prophet

01:35.173 --> 01:37.155
who passed judgment
on people for their wickedness.

01:37.255 --> 01:39.037
You wanna know what's ironic?

01:39.137 --> 01:41.199
I just stuck a thermometer
up a dead guy's butt.

01:41.299 --> 01:42.600
That's not irony.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.283
Perhaps a paradox,
a tragicomedy...

01:45.383 --> 01:47.745
-I could argue and make a case
for juxtaposition, but--
-[beeping]

01:48.906 --> 01:50.908
Ugh!

01:52.269 --> 01:55.212
Uh, 97.0.

01:55.312 --> 01:58.495
Postmortem temperature
drops 1.5 degrees every hour.

01:58.595 --> 02:01.218
Even given this heat,
an hour ago,

02:01.318 --> 02:03.320
this man was very much alive.

02:04.961 --> 02:06.623
[sighs]

02:06.723 --> 02:09.666
Well, you were with me,
so you couldn't have done it.

02:09.766 --> 02:11.067
Uh-huh.

02:11.167 --> 02:13.169
All right.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.293
And I do this very reluctantly.

02:18.094 --> 02:19.635
[Cammie grunts]

02:19.735 --> 02:23.299
All righty, just FYI,
Sheriff Grant should be here
in about a half an hour.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.021
[cell phone ringing]

02:26.782 --> 02:29.405
Well, hello there.
I was just heading to the gym.

02:29.505 --> 02:31.527
I-- I need you
to take a look at a body.

02:31.627 --> 02:34.650
That is so much more appealing
than free weights.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.412
Your place, 30 minutes?

02:37.512 --> 02:39.254
We can pick up
where we left off.

02:39.354 --> 02:41.356
I'm talking about a dead body.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.058
Jesus, another one?

02:43.158 --> 02:45.500
Otis, we need you.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.602
I'll text you the location.

02:48.643 --> 02:50.645
[quirky banjo music playing]

02:59.053 --> 03:03.337
Oh, hell no. Nope, nope.
Step away from the eyeball.

03:04.538 --> 03:06.240
Has it occurred to you
that this neck injury

03:06.340 --> 03:09.043
bears a striking resemblance
to my wife's fatal wound?

03:09.143 --> 03:11.245
Do not try to distract me.

03:11.345 --> 03:12.646
You have motive
for both murders.

03:12.746 --> 03:14.848
But not opportunity
for this one,

03:14.948 --> 03:18.492
and the only person who could
conceivably commit murder
on my behalf is Checotah.

03:18.592 --> 03:21.775
Oh, no, man.
I couldn't kill anyone.
Except maybe Hitler.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.657
But I'm worried that would
mess up the timelines in ways,

03:23.757 --> 03:25.758
like, we could only
begin to imagine.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.143
Let's maybe put a pin in that.

03:30.243 --> 03:34.747
Also consider that we got
put onto Mr. Cedar's trail
by Alicia Perez.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.069
You think she only used us
to flush him out?

03:37.169 --> 03:38.551
What do you think?

03:38.651 --> 03:40.312
[Cammie] Well, if that's true,
then he's only dead

03:40.412 --> 03:41.954
because we went
looking for him.

03:42.054 --> 03:44.536
Good, he deserved it.

03:47.179 --> 03:49.421
Oh, eyeballs are so weird.

03:54.426 --> 03:56.428
Thank you. I owe you one.

03:58.230 --> 04:00.231
Where's the eyeball?

04:02.313 --> 04:04.416
You ruined our dinner,
and now for dessert,

04:04.516 --> 04:06.498
we get a corpse
and chunks of trachea.

04:06.598 --> 04:07.779
Excellent.

04:07.879 --> 04:10.381
I recognize the sarcasm,
but I choose to ignore it.

04:10.481 --> 04:13.104
[Otis sighs]

04:13.204 --> 04:15.586
-Cause of death:
sharp force trauma to the neck.
-[phone camera clicks]

04:15.686 --> 04:18.189
Yes, we figured that out
already, thank you.

04:18.289 --> 04:22.152
You also figure out
how to apologize
for spying on my date?

04:22.252 --> 04:25.516
Shit, you guys are acting
like two bucks
in a one-deer town.

04:25.616 --> 04:29.039
Hey, sheriff's on his way.
Can we just focus here?

04:29.139 --> 04:31.141
Yeah, sorry.

04:33.223 --> 04:34.805
No defensive wounds.

04:34.905 --> 04:36.206
Killer must've snuck up on him.

04:36.306 --> 04:37.367
Obvious.

04:37.467 --> 04:39.049
Why am I here?

04:39.149 --> 04:40.370
You know, if you want me here,

04:40.470 --> 04:42.832
the least you could do
is not be so rude.

04:49.478 --> 04:51.821
His fingernails,
top halves are brown.

04:51.921 --> 04:53.743
Bottom are white.
That's called Lindsay's nails.

04:53.843 --> 04:56.345
He must've had crazy-high
creatinine levels.

04:56.445 --> 04:59.588
Is that consistent
with a youngish,

04:59.688 --> 05:01.690
otherwise healthy-looking
scoundrel?

05:02.731 --> 05:04.753
-No, it is not.
-[siren wailing]

05:04.853 --> 05:06.595
[Checotah] Sheriff Grant.

05:06.695 --> 05:08.697
You better hurry it
the fuck up.

05:09.738 --> 05:12.040
What are you doing?
What is that?

05:12.140 --> 05:14.442
It's the eyeball.
They'll think
the peacock ate it.

05:14.542 --> 05:15.764
So now I'm your accomplice?

05:15.864 --> 05:18.967
Otis, you are a fine man
and a fine doctor,

05:19.067 --> 05:22.510
and I apologize for any
dinner-ruining shenanigans.

05:23.311 --> 05:24.973
I am not taking the eyeball.

05:25.073 --> 05:28.035
Is anyone listening to me?
I am not taking the eyeball.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.799
I'm gonna go find
the nearest Coke machine.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.101
[siren stops]

05:34.201 --> 05:36.884
You two... just wait here.

05:40.928 --> 05:43.390
There better be
a good explanation
for why you're here.

05:43.490 --> 05:44.631
There's an honest explanation,

05:44.731 --> 05:47.694
so in a...
in a sense, it's good.

05:49.095 --> 05:53.199
But you might get upset,
so it's both bad and good.

05:53.299 --> 05:55.642
So you just stumbled
on a homicide

05:55.742 --> 05:59.205
hours after telling me
you'd found a murder weapon
from another homicide,

05:59.305 --> 06:01.848
a weapon which, by the way,
I still haven't seen.

06:01.948 --> 06:03.329
It's at my house. I...

06:03.429 --> 06:05.411
I got a lead,
so we followed it here.

06:05.511 --> 06:07.513
Who is "we"?

06:08.434 --> 06:11.357
Okay... come on out.

06:13.199 --> 06:16.422
Oh, good God almighty,
it's the Scooby gang.

06:16.522 --> 06:20.145
Everyone who does not
have a badge,

06:20.245 --> 06:22.247
leave. Now.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.112
Did you even consider
that bringing civilians

06:27.212 --> 06:30.155
to an active crime scene
is a terrible idea?

06:30.255 --> 06:33.958
I expect more from you
than this ass-itching bullshit.

06:34.058 --> 06:36.281
Okay, I've taken
the Vida Prescott investigation

06:36.381 --> 06:38.763
further than anyone has
in five years.

06:38.863 --> 06:40.325
-Yes, you have.
-Mm-hmm.

06:40.425 --> 06:42.366
And you know what?
You're due some credit.

06:42.466 --> 06:44.689
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

06:44.789 --> 06:46.731
You get to fill out
the paperwork,

06:46.831 --> 06:50.975
and homicide paperwork
is real, real boring,

06:51.075 --> 06:53.437
super detailed--
I'm talking triplicate shit.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.282
Looking forward to it, sir!

06:59.563 --> 07:01.565
Love homework, sir.

07:02.606 --> 07:04.608
[whimsical music playing]

07:07.090 --> 07:09.092
Where's his eyeball?

07:12.175 --> 07:14.217
I... I believe
the peacock ate it.

07:15.618 --> 07:17.620
[theme music playing]

07:22.625 --> 07:24.527
It's a long shot,

07:24.627 --> 07:26.749
but my family knows pretty much
everybody who hangs out
at Peacock Motor Court.

07:27.429 --> 07:29.431
[animals chittering]

07:30.032 --> 07:31.814
Tell me those are raccoons.

07:31.914 --> 07:33.916
No, it's tree alligators.

07:34.837 --> 07:37.299
Dude, trying
to lighten this shit up.

07:37.399 --> 07:39.401
Those peacocks, like,
really freaked me out.

07:40.882 --> 07:42.824
This would not happen
in Atlanta.

07:42.924 --> 07:44.926
I have an eyeball in my bag.

07:46.127 --> 07:48.850
There's an eyeball in my bag!

07:52.654 --> 07:55.556
Just be friendly, you know?

07:55.656 --> 07:57.658
Just be real... friendly.

08:01.302 --> 08:02.403
Cool.

08:02.503 --> 08:04.505
[quirky music playing]

08:08.549 --> 08:10.551
[indistinct chatter]

08:12.352 --> 08:14.134
Hey, y'all.

08:14.234 --> 08:15.455
Looking good.

08:15.555 --> 08:18.839
Remember the doctor?
Dr. Wright and... Bell.

08:24.484 --> 08:26.626
Yeah, I would love a drink!

08:26.726 --> 08:27.787
Who's pouring?

08:27.887 --> 08:29.889
That there's local.
Help yourself, Doc.

08:40.099 --> 08:42.762
I'm looking for information
on Jeremiah Cedar.

08:42.862 --> 08:45.044
Don't know him.

08:45.144 --> 08:47.146
Now can I punch
this asshole in the face?

08:49.788 --> 08:52.611
I embrace discomfort.
I confront my fears.

08:52.711 --> 08:55.814
-I embrace discomfort.
I confront my fears.
-Are you good, man?

08:55.914 --> 08:57.916
I embrace discomfort.

08:58.597 --> 09:00.599
I confront my fears.

09:01.359 --> 09:03.381
I embrace discomfort.

09:03.481 --> 09:05.383
I confront my fears.

09:05.483 --> 09:07.385
I drive eight hours
back from the Everglades,

09:07.485 --> 09:08.867
and I gotta look
at this nincompoop?

09:08.967 --> 09:10.968
[Bell] David...

09:11.409 --> 09:13.411
it's lovely to see you again.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.013
Ooh, I, for one, am delighted.

09:17.495 --> 09:18.796
Look at the poor guy,
Uncle David.

09:18.896 --> 09:20.678
He's not a poor guy.

09:20.778 --> 09:23.000
He made all us poor guys.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.602
We bought all this stuff
when you announced
that seafront project.

09:25.702 --> 09:27.484
You know Floyd over there?

09:27.584 --> 09:29.446
He used all his savings.

09:29.546 --> 09:31.929
And Alice, Alice,
she quit her job.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.030
You sold us on hope,

09:34.351 --> 09:36.052
and then you just walked away.

09:36.152 --> 09:39.015
You know, the blame thing
isn't really super productive.

09:39.115 --> 09:41.057
You know why I was back
on the reservation?

09:41.157 --> 09:42.619
Cousin Luke is dying,

09:42.719 --> 09:47.223
and we agreed
that his seat on the council
should stay in our family.

09:47.323 --> 09:49.665
-Campaigning's a lot of work.
-Lazy's no excuse.

09:49.765 --> 09:51.227
Got other priorities, man.

09:51.327 --> 09:54.830
What, delivering packages
and mending broken
rich white folks?

09:54.930 --> 09:56.872
Come on, Che, you have a chance

09:56.972 --> 09:59.355
to do something real
instead of whatever this is.

09:59.455 --> 10:01.457
[Bell] Pardon the interruption.

10:02.578 --> 10:03.919
-[Checotah] Bell.
-He is doing something real.

10:04.019 --> 10:06.021
-Bell.
-No, no, no.

10:07.783 --> 10:09.785
He knows how to be a friend.

10:10.425 --> 10:12.427
And that is inestimably real.

10:14.229 --> 10:17.892
You know, the only blessing
with your father's death

10:17.992 --> 10:20.115
is that he didn't have to see
what became of his son.

10:23.398 --> 10:25.400
[somber music playing]

10:37.411 --> 10:39.793
Baby, you need
to listen to Bianca, okay?

10:39.893 --> 10:41.895
[Tyler] I wanna sleep at Dad's.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.598
So it's Dad now, huh?

10:44.698 --> 10:46.700
He said I could.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.382
Maybe soon, okay?

10:50.464 --> 10:52.465
-I love you, bug.
-I love you.

10:53.426 --> 10:55.428
Bye.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.792
[somber music playing]

11:04.917 --> 11:06.959
Hey, bubba. You good?

11:07.840 --> 11:09.902
Fantastic.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.384
I'm just enjoying this hooch.

11:11.484 --> 11:13.486
I maybe have
something on Cedar.

11:17.049 --> 11:19.111
You knew Jeremiah Cedar?

11:19.211 --> 11:20.032
A little bit.

11:20.132 --> 11:22.194
I work for Perez Sugar
in shipping.

11:22.294 --> 11:23.916
Used to be
a quarter-Miccosukee guy

11:24.016 --> 11:26.999
went by the name
of Jeremiah Cedar
till about five years ago.

11:27.099 --> 11:28.240
Then he just took off.

11:28.340 --> 11:29.961
-He worked at Perez Sugar?
-Yup.

11:30.061 --> 11:31.763
Other than
the big-box stores on 30A,

11:31.863 --> 11:33.845
it's, like,
the only game in town.

11:33.945 --> 11:35.647
Other than the strip club.

11:35.747 --> 11:37.248
-True.
-And the other strip club.

11:37.348 --> 11:38.970
Did any of the others know?

11:39.070 --> 11:42.734
Sure, they did,
but nobody wants to help you
on account of you being a dick.

11:42.834 --> 11:45.456
Moving on,
what was Jeremiah like?

11:45.556 --> 11:47.778
Was he a degenerate,
a philanderer?

11:47.878 --> 11:49.700
Nicest guy in the world.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.824
Yeah, but was it a niceness
which belied some sort
of creepy ulterior motive?

11:53.924 --> 11:56.427
Nope, just nice. I noticed.

11:56.527 --> 11:58.949
Dude that handsome,
you figure that he'd be a jerk.

11:59.049 --> 12:01.151
I mean, I'd be a jerk
if I looked like that,

12:01.251 --> 12:02.793
but I can't,
because I look like this.

12:02.893 --> 12:04.995
So I gotta be nice.

12:05.095 --> 12:09.739
I can't remember if I've ever
seen masculinity and tenderness
so well balanced in a fella.

12:10.940 --> 12:13.143
[dramatic music playing]

12:14.264 --> 12:15.565
[Otis] This is unbelievable.

12:15.665 --> 12:17.847
How many years you figure
you get for a stolen eyeball?

12:17.947 --> 12:19.289
Because I am a doctor,

12:19.389 --> 12:21.951
and this shit
does not play well on a resume.

12:23.392 --> 12:24.694
Are you even listening to me?

12:24.794 --> 12:26.796
Look at this.

12:27.556 --> 12:28.697
He had cataracts.

12:28.797 --> 12:31.060
How does a 32-year-old
have cataracts?

12:31.160 --> 12:32.661
Chronic kidney disease.

12:32.761 --> 12:34.763
That would also explain
the Lindsay's nails.

12:36.685 --> 12:39.087
[sighs] No more dead bodies.

12:40.168 --> 12:41.430
I can't handle the paperwork.

12:41.530 --> 12:42.631
Noted.

12:42.731 --> 12:45.273
Somewhere around hour three,
I needed a break,

12:45.373 --> 12:49.397
so I started looking
at Vida's autopsy photos again.

12:49.497 --> 12:51.499
How is that a break?

12:52.740 --> 12:56.504
Can you, um... can you
show me the photos you took
of Cedar's neck?

12:57.705 --> 12:59.707
[mouse clicking]

13:01.108 --> 13:02.930
[Cammie clears throat]

13:03.030 --> 13:04.692
Those look the same to you?

13:04.792 --> 13:06.494
[Bell] Both cuts
start below the ear.

13:06.594 --> 13:09.136
They run obliquely down,
across the midline,

13:09.236 --> 13:11.338
ending slightly below
the point of origin.

13:11.438 --> 13:14.141
Which means both throats
were slit from behind.

13:14.241 --> 13:16.323
And both cuts run parallel
to lines of cleavage.

13:17.204 --> 13:19.206
Neither have hesitation marks.

13:20.807 --> 13:22.809
It's the same killer.

13:27.133 --> 13:29.135
I knew you couldn't have.

13:30.056 --> 13:32.058
[dramatic music playing]

13:40.226 --> 13:42.228
[Cammie] You okay?

13:45.751 --> 13:47.753
Jeremiah Cedar
didn't kill Vida...

13:49.755 --> 13:51.757
and neither did I.

13:53.238 --> 13:55.240
What I said
about you earlier, I'm...

13:57.082 --> 13:59.084
-I'm sorry.
-It's not what you said.

14:01.086 --> 14:02.267
I don't care what you say.

14:02.367 --> 14:03.908
Well, that's nice to hear.

14:04.008 --> 14:06.010
No, that's not what I mean.

14:07.572 --> 14:09.574
For years, I've been worried
that I killed her...

14:11.856 --> 14:13.858
that I did something
so awful that...

14:15.299 --> 14:17.301
I couldn't remember it, but...

14:19.904 --> 14:21.906
I didn't do it, Cammie.

14:25.309 --> 14:27.311
-I didn't do it.
-Hmm.

14:31.315 --> 14:36.540
I didn't do it!

14:36.640 --> 14:38.141
[chuckles]

14:38.241 --> 14:43.827
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

14:43.927 --> 14:46.709
I didn't do it! Ha-ha!

14:46.809 --> 14:50.793
-Hoo, ha, doo, doo.
-[laughing]

14:50.893 --> 14:53.716
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

14:53.816 --> 14:55.518
What is that?

14:55.618 --> 14:56.599
It's my "I didn't do it" dance.

14:56.699 --> 14:58.701
Okay.

15:09.671 --> 15:12.594
Hey, what if we could find
the murder weapon?

15:13.755 --> 15:16.278

15:18.039 --> 15:21.002

connected to you...

15:23.044 --> 15:25.026
That could just be because
somebody's trying to frame you,

15:25.126 --> 15:26.147
for example.

15:26.247 --> 15:27.869

17:07.944 --> 17:10.587
[grunts] Thanks.
I really needed that.

17:12.028 --> 17:13.450
I think that's a good review.

17:13.550 --> 17:14.971
Are you being needy?

17:15.071 --> 17:17.253
'Cause I can't handle
a needy guy.

I'm not a needy guy.

to send me there?

do you know of anyone
who would try to hurt
your nephew?

He was afraid of someone,
but I don't know who.

20:46.433 --> 20:48.856
He... He never
mentioned any names?

20:48.956 --> 20:52.319
No, poor thing had to deal
with being sick and scared
all at once.

20:52.999 --> 20:54.981
Sick?

20:55.081 --> 20:56.703
Was it kidney disease?

20:56.803 --> 20:58.345
Yeah.

20:58.445 --> 21:00.447
Took all of his strength.

21:01.247 --> 21:03.750
Only way he got by
is 'cause they kept paying him.

21:03.850 --> 21:05.952
-Who kept paying him?
-The Perez family.

21:06.052 --> 21:08.474
Perez Sugar kept paying him
even after he left?

21:08.574 --> 21:10.116
No, the other company.

21:10.216 --> 21:12.738
-The rum company, El Calvero?
-That one.

21:17.183 --> 21:19.184
Any chance you've got
one of his paychecks?

21:23.228 --> 21:25.230
Did you find
the philanderer's aunt?

21:25.711 --> 21:28.694
Yeah, and it was
kind of heartbreaking.

21:28.794 --> 21:30.175
I don't think
I wanna do that again.

21:30.275 --> 21:32.978
The same way you didn't
wanna answer my calls?

21:33.078 --> 21:34.419
I was busy.

21:34.519 --> 21:36.521
Doctor pay you a house call?

21:37.122 --> 21:38.823
Not your business.

21:38.923 --> 21:43.748
Also, I could get house calls
from the entire Atlanta Falcons
offensive line,

21:43.848 --> 21:45.710
and it still
would be none of your business.

21:45.810 --> 21:47.592
Fine, not my business.

21:47.692 --> 21:49.994
But in the event
that wasn't hypothetical,

21:50.094 --> 21:52.797
the Falcons ranked near
statistical bottom last season.

21:52.897 --> 21:54.899
Except in sex.

21:55.419 --> 21:58.762
-Really?
-No! Not really.

21:58.862 --> 22:01.565
And if you're done
talking about my sex life,

22:01.665 --> 22:03.667
look what Aunt Sam showed me.

22:05.068 --> 22:08.211
So Cedar got sick
while working at Perez Sugar.

22:08.311 --> 22:09.853
He quit,
but they kept paying him.

22:09.953 --> 22:13.376
So either the Perezes
are really generous...

22:13.476 --> 22:14.858
That seems unlikely.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.020
Or they were paying him

22:17.120 --> 22:19.222
to keep his mouth shut.

22:19.322 --> 22:20.343
Look at the signature.

-Alicia Perez.
-Mm-hmm.

22:22.485 --> 22:23.826
When she gave me the photo,

22:23.926 --> 22:25.928
she told me
she had no idea who he was.

22:27.770 --> 22:28.791
Either she knew the name

22:28.891 --> 22:29.872
and not the face...

22:29.972 --> 22:32.194
Or she's a bigger liar
than her daughter.

22:32.294 --> 22:34.296
Yeah.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.002
$249?

22:40.102 --> 22:41.964
And 99 cents.

22:42.064 --> 22:43.805
This says $49.99.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.487
I can see
you wrote a 2 in front.

22:45.587 --> 22:48.049
Yeah. He definitely did that.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.972
This isn't even a name brand.
This is some generic bullshit.

Come on. Come on.
I need it for my radar gun.

is why you go.

23:16.216 --> 23:18.038
I didn't not tell him.

23:18.138 --> 23:20.641
I just sort of left it open
to interpretation.

23:20.741 --> 23:22.903
-God, Urleen.
-I'm sorry.

23:24.584 --> 23:26.586
Why is this town
so goddamn small?

23:27.307 --> 23:29.309
-Bye.
-Uh...

23:29.709 --> 23:31.651
I was hoping to get
a quote about the murder.

23:31.751 --> 23:36.856
First, how 'bout you explain
why Tyler is suddenly
calling you Dad.

23:36.956 --> 23:39.258
I told him to.
Also, I'm his dad.

23:39.358 --> 23:40.740
It's, like, a fact.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.302
Did you also tell him
he could have a sleepover?

23:43.402 --> 23:46.025
-Uh, yeah.
-We're supposed to discuss
these things, Marcus.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.267
Look, I'm trying
to be better here.

23:48.367 --> 23:50.349

for the poor!

23:50.449 --> 23:51.870
That way,
if you fuck something up,

23:51.970 --> 23:53.232
it's just
a little piece of drywall,

23:53.332 --> 23:54.833
not a kid
for the rest of his life.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.675
[Sheriff Grant clears throat]

23:56.775 --> 23:58.777
I'll thank you
to give us the room.

24:06.224 --> 24:10.728
So you wanna tell me
what possessed you
to talk to Sam Tucker?

24:10.828 --> 24:12.830
With all due respect, Sheriff,

24:13.992 --> 24:16.134
Peacock Motor Court
is in my jurisdiction.

24:16.234 --> 24:19.337
Yeehaw Junction
is in my jurisdiction.

24:19.437 --> 24:21.739
Jeremiah Cedar lived on a boat,

24:21.839 --> 24:24.902
uh, in a marina
that's in my jurisdiction.

24:25.002 --> 24:27.064
So all notifications are on me.

24:27.164 --> 24:31.148
I do not like
having to repeat myself,
Officer Lorde,

24:31.248 --> 24:35.472
but Mayor Iwanaga
specifically offloaded
Major Crimes

24:35.572 --> 24:38.995
so that you can concentrate
on writing citations

24:39.095 --> 24:42.279
so that this godforsaken town
doesn't go down the crapper.

24:42.379 --> 24:45.802
My jurisdiction
is dictated by the manual.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.564
I'm happy to cite
the relevant section, sir.

24:47.664 --> 24:50.206
What section of the damn manual

24:50.306 --> 24:53.950
advises storing murder weapons
at your personal residence?

24:55.711 --> 24:57.133
Yeah.

24:57.233 --> 24:59.215
So you and I
are gonna go to your home,

24:59.315 --> 25:01.637
and you're gonna
hand me that weapon.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.920
[ominous music playing]

25:06.602 --> 25:08.604
Yes, sir.

25:13.048 --> 25:14.349
[Checotah]
Gonna make it explode?

25:14.449 --> 25:16.551
Kind of wanna see it explode,
but I also kind of don't.

25:16.651 --> 25:18.313
This is a fluorescent dye.

25:18.413 --> 25:21.116
Otis identified kidney disease,
which caused the cataracts,

25:21.216 --> 25:23.358
but what caused
the kidney disease
is the question.

25:23.458 --> 25:24.559
Maybe he was born that way,

25:24.659 --> 25:26.661
like I was born
with two uvulas.

25:27.542 --> 25:29.544
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

25:30.825 --> 25:32.326
-Oh, would you look at that.
-Ah.

25:32.426 --> 25:35.029
You know, only 2%
of the population
has a bifid uvula.

25:36.470 --> 25:38.572
I can make a cool
little sound with it.

25:38.672 --> 25:40.654

25:40.754 --> 25:42.756

25:43.437 --> 25:45.539
Not the case
with Jeremiah Cedar.

25:45.639 --> 25:47.661
He was healthy enough
to fornicate with my wife,

25:47.761 --> 25:49.463
and that was
an endurance sport, trust me.

25:49.563 --> 25:51.565
Turn that off.

25:53.967 --> 25:55.389
[Checotah] Oh, cool.

25:55.489 --> 25:56.630
[Bell] Not cool.

It's like Daredevil.

26:06.099 --> 26:08.101

26:08.861 --> 26:10.863
Anyway, it's not important.

26:15.748 --> 26:18.070
Those poisons are what
destroyed Cedar's kidneys.

26:23.996 --> 26:25.898
Your uncle David's cousin,
the sick one?

26:25.998 --> 26:27.259
Cousin Luke?

26:27.359 --> 26:29.661
He didn't, by any chance,
work at Perez Sugar, did he?

26:29.761 --> 26:31.763
Yeah.

26:32.404 --> 26:34.446
This isn't actually you
caring about people, is it?

26:44.896 --> 26:46.898
I didn't know you had a kid.

26:48.379 --> 26:50.201
Tyler.

26:50.301 --> 26:52.643
Yeah, he's, um...
he's down the street
at a friend's house.

26:52.743 --> 26:54.405
Mm.

26:54.505 --> 26:56.607
I was raised
by a single mother.

26:56.707 --> 26:59.730
Took good care of me, too,
even though
it about half killed her.

26:59.830 --> 27:01.992
-Not an easy road, is it?
-No.

27:03.233 --> 27:05.235
But he's...

27:06.436 --> 27:07.738
he's the best part of my life.

27:07.838 --> 27:09.940
Yeah.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.042
That's what my mother
used to say.

27:13.323 --> 27:17.307
So I, uh, I found the machete
at the Prescott house.

27:17.407 --> 27:20.690
I was worried Bell Prescott
might've been involved
in the murder, so I, uh...

27:21.731 --> 27:22.752
I took it into custody.

27:22.852 --> 27:24.954
Has Prescott
noticed it's missing?

27:25.054 --> 27:27.436
No, not that I'm aware of.

27:27.536 --> 27:29.639
I mean, that house
has so much shit in it.

27:29.739 --> 27:32.621
But I got new information
that leads me to believe
that he had no part of it.

27:35.624 --> 27:37.726
It was here. It was--

27:37.826 --> 27:39.568
I left it right here.

27:39.668 --> 27:41.670
Well, who else knew
that you had it?

27:42.791 --> 27:44.793
No one.

27:49.237 --> 27:51.239
Just you.

27:52.841 --> 27:55.143
I'm gonna go talk
to the neighbor.
Maybe they saw someone.

27:55.243 --> 27:58.967
You're in a world...
of bad here.

28:00.568 --> 28:03.451

is not making much sense,

28:04.172 --> 28:07.194

-Where the holy hell are you?
-Mr. Mayor,
I'm happy you called.

28:26.433 --> 28:28.375
I'm at home with Sheriff Grant.

28:28.475 --> 28:29.736
If you're not
at your post pronto,

28:29.836 --> 28:31.838
I will come and get you myself.

28:36.202 --> 28:38.204
The mayor's expecting me.

28:39.125 --> 28:41.107
Well...

28:41.207 --> 28:43.209

by a woodpecker
every morning at sunrise.

a wind chime made of
her high school CD collection

29:23.127 --> 29:24.588

of deterrence.

29:24.688 --> 29:27.031

can you stop hammering?

29:27.131 --> 29:29.673

an intimate moment in there?

29:29.773 --> 29:31.815
Yes, Darby, we are.

29:41.104 --> 29:43.106
So, um...

29:44.147 --> 29:47.050
I found
an old sugarcane machete

29:47.150 --> 29:48.892
in your house,

29:48.992 --> 29:50.994
and there's a chip in it

29:51.914 --> 29:54.077
that matches the shard that...

29:54.997 --> 29:56.999
Otis pulled from Vida.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.922
I took it because I thought
you killed her.

30:05.608 --> 30:08.470
The murder weapon was... here?

30:08.570 --> 30:10.232
Yeah.

30:10.332 --> 30:12.034
But someone stole it
from my house,

30:12.134 --> 30:14.136
and Sheriff Grant's
the only one I told.

30:15.097 --> 30:17.039
What could
possibly be his motive?

30:17.139 --> 30:18.720
I don't know, but I have
to head over to the I-10

30:18.820 --> 30:20.202
long enough to get
the mayor off my ass.

30:20.302 --> 30:23.925
Then I can see if I can
find out what Grant's up to.

30:24.025 --> 30:26.027
[Darby] I know what he's up to.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.435
You're the only one
who knew about the machete.

36:30.535 --> 36:33.258
So you thought
I was tossing evidence?

36:34.379 --> 36:37.282
Why the hell
would I be tossing evidence?

36:37.382 --> 36:39.384
What else would you
be doing out here?

36:47.191 --> 36:49.193
Really?

36:53.117 --> 36:54.298
[Otis] Oh.

36:54.398 --> 36:56.661
It's a moonshine distillery.

36:56.761 --> 36:59.623
Why does everyone out here
drink so much moonshine?

36:59.723 --> 37:02.526
There's plenty of
professionally made alcohol
available at the store.

37:03.607 --> 37:05.609
It's time we had a talk.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.392
So if I've got this right,

37:08.492 --> 37:12.636
you figure
whoever killed Cedar
killed Vida Prescott,

37:12.736 --> 37:16.520
and Alicia Perez
might be involved,

37:16.620 --> 37:21.124
and for some reason,
I'm stealing evidence
on her behalf.

37:21.224 --> 37:24.467
Viewed in a certain light,
the chain of events
suggests that.

37:25.548 --> 37:26.809
You're not dropping this,
are you?

37:26.909 --> 37:28.811
No.

37:28.911 --> 37:30.893
No, I'm not,

37:30.993 --> 37:34.016
because there's a lot
of bad shit going on,
and turns out, I'm a cop.

37:34.116 --> 37:35.858
Yes, you are.

37:35.958 --> 37:38.340
But I'm not working
for the Perezes.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.442
I'm investigating them.

37:42.965 --> 37:44.967
Here.

37:45.767 --> 37:50.552
You might as well know
so, at the very least,
you don't fuck it up.

37:50.652 --> 37:54.756
Now, I believe the Perez boys
are using the company trucks

37:54.856 --> 37:58.119
to move drugs
from the Panhandle to Tampa

37:58.219 --> 37:59.961
and then up
the eastern seaboard.

38:00.061 --> 38:02.564
But if you didn't take
the machete from my house,

38:02.664 --> 38:04.485
who did?

38:04.585 --> 38:07.969
Have you considered
that baby daddy of yours
might be involved

38:08.069 --> 38:11.852
or that your kid
might have seen the machete
and told him?

38:11.952 --> 38:14.255
I mean, any one of the Perezes
could've broken in.

38:14.355 --> 38:17.738
That half-assed lock of yours
wouldn't keep out
a cracked-out bumblebee,

38:17.838 --> 38:19.099
let alone a Perez.

38:19.199 --> 38:20.300
How would they have known that?

38:20.400 --> 38:22.402
You tell me.

38:30.370 --> 38:33.753
Listen, you've got a world
of potential, Cammie,

38:33.853 --> 38:36.796
and I don't wanna
see you ruin that
by getting ahead of yourself.

38:36.896 --> 38:37.877
[scoffs]

38:37.977 --> 38:40.580
So you are
officially off the case.

38:42.622 --> 38:44.404
And any evidence
will be transferred

38:44.504 --> 38:46.505
into the custody
of Okaloosa County.

38:47.266 --> 38:49.268
Is that clear?

38:50.629 --> 38:52.631
Mm-hmm.

38:57.716 --> 38:59.178
Ah, it makes no sense.

38:59.278 --> 39:01.420
[Cammie] Bell, he has evidence.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.823
Sheriff Grant's been running
surveillance for... for months,

39:04.923 --> 39:07.646
not just at the sugar plant,
at El Calvero, in Tampa.

39:08.607 --> 39:09.988
Stop that.

39:10.088 --> 39:12.390
Stop that.
It's creepy and distracting.

39:12.490 --> 39:15.113
God, why do you
have a collection
of family dentures?

39:15.213 --> 39:17.916
Well, excuse me for caring
about my familial history.

39:18.016 --> 39:19.717
-[sighs] Rhetorical, okay?
-[cell phone chimes]

39:19.817 --> 39:21.819
Rhetorical.

39:24.141 --> 39:26.664
Ramon and Yasiel
may have been trafficking...

39:28.105 --> 39:30.247
drugs for years.

39:30.347 --> 39:31.849
[Bell] Did Vida know?

39:31.949 --> 39:33.530
Not everything
is about you and Vida.

39:33.630 --> 39:38.135
All I know is that someone
broke into my house
and stole the murder weapon,

39:38.235 --> 39:40.237
and right now, it's looking
like that someone was a Perez.

39:41.918 --> 39:43.920
Something is troubling you.

39:44.321 --> 39:45.862
Tell me.

39:45.962 --> 39:47.964
Please, I will stop
fiddling with the dentures.

39:50.086 --> 39:52.088
Fine.

39:53.570 --> 39:57.393
Marcus... wants a sleepover.

39:57.493 --> 39:59.195
-With you?
-With Tyler.

39:59.295 --> 40:00.276
Is that a problem?

40:00.376 --> 40:02.999
Yes, that's a problem,
because he...

40:03.099 --> 40:05.961
he talked to Tyler about it
instead of going through me.

40:06.061 --> 40:08.804
Oh, so your problem
is how he went about doing it,

40:08.904 --> 40:10.446
not that he wants
to spend time with his child.

40:10.546 --> 40:11.687
Oh, you're missing the point.

40:11.787 --> 40:14.650
I think
I'm clarifying the point.

40:14.750 --> 40:17.212
What if Tyler told him
about the machete, you know?

40:17.312 --> 40:19.254
Have you considered
that it may not be bad

40:19.354 --> 40:21.817
for a boy to have
a relationship with his father?

40:21.917 --> 40:24.619
He disappeared on Tyler.
What if he disappears
on him again?

40:24.719 --> 40:26.721
Well, clearly
he wants to change that.

40:27.402 --> 40:29.424
Why are you taking his side?

40:29.524 --> 40:31.266
I miss my father.

40:31.366 --> 40:34.389
I know I'm a disaster now,
but the person I was before,

40:34.489 --> 40:36.671
that man was molded by him,

40:36.771 --> 40:40.114
and it would have been
a terrible loss
not to have had that.

40:40.214 --> 40:42.877
Well, I didn't have
a relationship with mine,
and I turned out fine.

40:42.977 --> 40:45.800
Yes, you're fine,

40:45.900 --> 40:48.682
and regardless of what happens,
Tyler will be fine.

40:48.782 --> 40:50.684
Yeah, okay,
that's a flippant thing to say.

40:50.784 --> 40:52.126
Because he has you.

40:52.226 --> 40:54.227
[gentle music playing]

40:56.189 --> 40:57.130
[footsteps]

40:57.230 --> 40:59.012
[Millicent] You were right.

40:59.112 --> 41:01.014
I made some calls.

41:01.114 --> 41:02.656
Do you remember the Stevens?

41:02.756 --> 41:05.018
Betty and Mack, they moved
to the Carolina Highlands.

41:05.118 --> 41:08.021
Mack died of kidney disease,

41:08.121 --> 41:12.025
and Nancy Jo Beckerman
and her son are sick too.

41:12.125 --> 41:16.269
Their medical bills
are being paid by El Calvero.

41:16.369 --> 41:17.470
Hush money.

41:17.570 --> 41:19.472
What is happening?

41:19.572 --> 41:20.633
They're poisoning people.

41:20.733 --> 41:22.735
[ominous music playing]

41:30.462 --> 41:33.245
Can you explain to me
why I'm feeling empathy
for the man who cuckolded me?

41:33.345 --> 41:36.288
I... don't wanna unpack that.

41:36.388 --> 41:39.291
This was my family business
before the Perezes
came into our lives.

41:39.391 --> 41:41.293
You didn't do this.

41:41.393 --> 41:44.255
-You didn't poison anyone.
-I shut Vida out.

41:44.355 --> 41:47.639
I pushed her into Cedar's arms
and straight into that
freight train of a family.

41:49.360 --> 41:51.522
They will run over
anyone who gets
between them and money.

41:52.603 --> 41:54.605
Maybe that's what killed her.

41:56.487 --> 41:58.489
Maybe she found out.

42:05.816 --> 42:09.720
Hey, any, uh,
wild plans for tonight?

42:09.820 --> 42:12.963
Me and some of my QAnon gals
are gonna play
Settlers of Catan.

42:13.063 --> 42:14.364
-Mm.
-You wanna come?

42:14.464 --> 42:16.466
Uh, no.

42:16.826 --> 42:18.728
Thank you.

42:18.828 --> 42:20.370
I'm treating Tyler to some
pizza from Hungry Howie's.

42:20.470 --> 42:22.412
Oh, "gour-met."

42:22.512 --> 42:24.093
[Mayor Iwanaga] Lorde!

42:24.193 --> 42:26.616
Mr. Mayor, sir.

42:26.716 --> 42:28.938
What the holy heck
has gotten into you?

42:29.038 --> 42:31.160
Is it your... moon time?

42:32.842 --> 42:34.183
Are you an actual person?

42:34.283 --> 42:36.625
Oh, I am out of patience.

42:36.725 --> 42:38.587
You turn on the news
this afternoon?

42:38.687 --> 42:42.831
The Grundwald brothers tried
drag racing their airboats
right past your speed trap.

42:42.931 --> 42:45.314
-Mm, shit.
-One of them flipped.

42:45.414 --> 42:48.597
The interstate
was backed up for hours.

42:48.697 --> 42:51.039
Can I just move on
to begging for forgiveness?

42:51.139 --> 42:54.322
You can move on
to handing me your badge
and get the heck out of here.

42:54.422 --> 42:56.324
What?

42:56.424 --> 42:59.567
No, no, I... I need this job.

42:59.667 --> 43:01.169
Consider yourself terminated.

43:01.269 --> 43:03.271
[tense music playing]

43:07.875 --> 43:09.877
You need
a court order for that.

43:11.038 --> 43:13.401
This boat is evidence.
It's going to county impound.

43:16.644 --> 43:18.025
Max, please.

43:18.125 --> 43:20.067
This is the last gift
from my wife.

43:20.167 --> 43:23.791
I am sorry about your loss,
but that was five years ago.

43:23.891 --> 43:25.592
It's time to move on.

43:25.692 --> 43:29.076
The boat is relevant
in an active
murder investigation.

43:29.176 --> 43:31.078
After everything
my father did for you,

43:31.178 --> 43:32.999
you can't do one decent thing
for this family?

43:33.099 --> 43:34.120
Pardon me?

43:34.220 --> 43:36.603
You'd still be gutting fish
and fleecing tourists

43:36.703 --> 43:37.964
if he hadn't
given you that job.

43:38.064 --> 43:39.966
He was the only one
who believed in you.

43:40.066 --> 43:43.449
Have you forgotten
what happened in there
about six years ago?

43:43.549 --> 43:47.513
'Cause I consider
my debt to Indigo Prescott
paid in full.

43:48.954 --> 43:51.357
So don't ask me
to overextend my charity.

43:53.199 --> 43:56.121
-[song playing]
-[humming along]

44:00.766 --> 44:03.388
Ooh, baby, I'm sorry.
Is my music too loud?

44:03.488 --> 44:05.310
-I know you're upstairs
trying to get Tyler to--
-[song stops]

44:05.410 --> 44:07.893
-I need you.
-Come on, sit down. What's up?

44:14.539 --> 44:16.201
I got fired.

44:16.301 --> 44:17.482
Oh.

44:17.582 --> 44:19.284
I had to stick a thermometer
up a dead guy's ass.

44:19.384 --> 44:20.605
Uh...

44:20.705 --> 44:23.408
I'm losing my son, and someone
broke into my house.

44:23.508 --> 44:25.509
Oh, my God.

44:25.990 --> 44:27.992
-Are you okay?
-No.

44:29.113 --> 44:31.735
No, but there are
things that I...

44:31.835 --> 44:33.837
I don't want anyone to find.

44:34.438 --> 44:36.480
With the way this is going,
I just--

44:38.322 --> 44:40.324
I need you to hold on
to something for me.

44:41.445 --> 44:44.307
What kind of something?

44:44.407 --> 44:46.770
Things I should
probably let go of,
but I'm not sure I'm ready.

44:50.333 --> 44:52.155
Let Bitty take care of that.

44:52.255 --> 44:54.257
Hmm.

44:56.219 --> 44:58.221
[dramatic music playing]

45:02.024 --> 45:04.026
Trust me.

45:08.871 --> 45:10.953
I know exactly
what to do with this.

45:12.554 --> 45:15.597
Ain't nobody getting past
Bitty's sassafras tea...

45:19.241 --> 45:22.564
On account of Bitty's
Smith & Wesson.

45:24.366 --> 45:25.667
[chuckles]

45:25.767 --> 45:26.868
I got you, girl.

45:26.968 --> 45:28.470
[both laughing]

45:28.570 --> 45:30.572
Girl, I got you.

45:32.974 --> 45:34.976
Why didn't you tell me
what your father was doing?

45:36.097 --> 45:38.940
Because you would have
gotten in the way.

45:40.181 --> 45:42.183
We could've fixed it
together, Vida.

45:44.505 --> 45:47.488
You might still be alive
if you hadn't kept
so many secrets.

45:47.588 --> 45:50.371
You're the one
who started keeping secrets.

45:50.471 --> 45:52.833
Why didn't you tell anyone
the truth about your father?

45:54.875 --> 45:56.937
[distant explosion]

45:57.037 --> 45:59.039
[ominous music playing]

46:07.247 --> 46:09.249
The sugar plant.

46:09.929 --> 46:11.951
[suspenseful music playing]

46:12.051 --> 46:14.253
[sirens wailing]

46:26.705 --> 46:28.527
Burn it down.

46:28.627 --> 46:30.629
Burn it all down.

46:34.032 --> 46:36.034
[ominous banjo music playing]
