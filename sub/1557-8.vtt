16:00.673 --> 16:01.863
some things were said

16:01.887 --> 16:02.887
in the heat of the moment

16:02.949 --> 16:03.989
that weren't really meant.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.216
I know you don't think
I'm a perv.

16:05.284 --> 16:06.418
Yes, that.
That.

16:06.485 --> 16:08.220
And -- and also,
that thing about

16:08.287 --> 16:09.988
you not having a crush
on me anymore.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.290
- I-I promise I don't.
- Oh, Manny, come on.

16:12.358 --> 16:13.892
We're really trying
to wrap things up.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.028
I swear. I barely even
look at you anymore.

16:16.095 --> 16:17.095
Well, when did that happen?

16:17.163 --> 16:18.443
Was it when I lightened my hair?

16:18.464 --> 16:20.332
It washes me out, right?
Do other people feel this way?

16:21.414 --> 16:22.414
Haley,

16:23.146 --> 16:26.256
you are a beautiful woman
who will break many hearts

16:26.259 --> 16:28.327
before you're done,
mine among them.

16:28.395 --> 16:30.229
Aw.

16:30.297 --> 16:32.231
[ Smooches ] Oh.

16:32.299 --> 16:34.266
- Uh, you meant "hug," didn't you?
- Yup. Mm-hmm.

16:34.334 --> 16:35.868
Hmm. I'm -- I'm sorry.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.403
We need a smaller platter
or something

16:44.471 --> 16:45.571
that makes this
look normal-sized!

16:45.639 --> 16:48.074
How do you feel about a coaster?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.442
Fill it in with
this sandwich turkey.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.876
It's past its sell-by date,

16:50.944 --> 16:52.478
but I always think that's more
of a suggestion, anyway.

16:52.546 --> 16:54.046
I'm gonna get them
all loaded up on bread.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.314
Nigella: <i> And now, Philip,</i>

16:55.382 --> 16:56.982
<i>what to do
with all the leftovers.</i>

16:57.050 --> 16:59.585
What happened
to the sweet girl I downloaded?

17:00.591 --> 17:02.326
So, did you have it out
with our daughter?

17:02.332 --> 17:04.291
Well, you know, it's a holiday, and I --
[ Scoffs ]

17:04.446 --> 17:05.814
Fine!
I will handle this.

17:05.882 --> 17:08.183
I will be the permanent bad guy
in this family

17:08.251 --> 17:10.486
'cause you're so afraid
of our daughter not liking you.

17:10.553 --> 17:13.188
Ju-- but just so you know,
I had one parent growing up

17:13.256 --> 17:14.388
who wanted to be my friend

17:14.457 --> 17:16.391
and another one
who didn't care about that.

17:16.459 --> 17:18.127
Guess which one
is still in my life.

17:19.286 --> 17:20.586
Delicious homemade bread?

17:20.587 --> 17:22.320
That looks like
just regular white bread.

17:22.388 --> 17:24.390
You two seem drunk.
This will soak up the booze.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.358
Am I...?

17:26.425 --> 17:28.294
Oh, Alex. Wait.

17:28.362 --> 17:29.395
Lily.

17:29.463 --> 17:30.963
Alex brought your backpack
in for you.

17:31.031 --> 17:33.032
So why don't you go ahead
and take it out to our car?

17:33.100 --> 17:34.100
Maybe later.

17:34.101 --> 17:35.181
No, Lily!

17:35.202 --> 17:36.736
Um, it's okay.
I will take it now.

17:36.803 --> 17:38.571
Alex, put the backpack down!

17:39.624 --> 17:40.526
Mom!

17:40.929 --> 17:43.196
Lily, you are not in charge
of what you wear,

17:43.264 --> 17:44.898
of breakfast, or anything.

17:44.966 --> 17:48.535
Now, put that backpack on
and march it out to the car!

17:48.603 --> 17:50.771
[ Grunts ] It's too heavy.

17:50.838 --> 17:52.039
Well, that's tough

17:52.106 --> 17:53.941
because I'm not carrying it
for you anymore!

17:54.008 --> 17:55.909
I like this new guy, huh?

17:58.028 --> 17:58.696
Oh!

18:00.183 --> 18:02.217
See? I told you
it was too heavy.

18:02.285 --> 18:04.319
My gosh, what in the world
is in this?!

18:04.387 --> 18:05.921
No!

18:05.989 --> 18:07.956
Claire, why is there
a fully cooked turkey

18:08.024 --> 18:09.858
in the backpack
we left at your house?

18:09.926 --> 18:10.966
Yes, Claire, why is there?

18:10.994 --> 18:12.194
Could it be you made a backup

18:12.262 --> 18:13.896
because you never trusted me
with the dinner at all?

18:13.963 --> 18:15.603
Well, I thought there was
a chance that --

18:15.632 --> 18:16.899
What, that I'd screw
everything up?

18:16.966 --> 18:18.246
You know what?
I have half a mind

18:18.268 --> 18:20.028
to pack up the beautiful meal
I made --

18:20.036 --> 18:22.971
Dinner is served!

18:23.039 --> 18:24.469
I-I-I don't --
I don't understand.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.845
Does everybody get one?

18:26.551 --> 18:28.753
I was just going
to sub in my turkey

18:28.820 --> 18:30.940
if you got in trouble,
which, I mean...

18:30.989 --> 18:32.423
Well, now you touched it,

18:32.491 --> 18:34.458
so you, Alex, and Haley
will share that one.

18:34.526 --> 18:36.761
- Dark meat for your dark,
untrusting soul. - Phil!

18:36.828 --> 18:38.562
You know, this was
a brand-new backpack,

18:38.630 --> 18:40.870
and now it's got
turkey juice all up in it!

18:40.899 --> 18:42.099
Okay, back it up, old yeller.

18:42.167 --> 18:43.567
Okay, could we just stop?

18:43.635 --> 18:45.670
This is Thanksgiving,
for god's sake.

18:45.937 --> 18:48.773
And not to mention that tomorrow
is Luke's birthday.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.760
Hey, this is the suitcase
with my present, right?

18:50.809 --> 18:51.809
You had it in the video.

18:51.877 --> 18:53.444
No!

18:53.512 --> 18:55.179
What the hell?!

18:55.247 --> 18:58.249
Congratulations, Luke!

18:58.316 --> 18:59.950
You're finally a man!

19:00.018 --> 19:03.988
In my country, when you turn 16,
you get your turkey.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.156
Wait, you made the video

19:05.223 --> 19:06.703
before you decided
to come back early.

19:06.725 --> 19:08.893
Were you gonna keep the turkey
in there for four days?

19:08.960 --> 19:11.362
It's a tradition.

19:11.430 --> 19:14.298
How did you get that
thing through customs?

19:14.366 --> 19:16.600
It is called customs.

19:16.668 --> 19:19.103
They... respect customs.

19:19.171 --> 19:20.204
Wait a minute.

19:20.272 --> 19:21.839
I know this bird.

19:21.907 --> 19:23.707
I've been oiling
these breasts all day.

19:23.775 --> 19:25.309
This is my turkey!

19:26.257 --> 19:27.691
Done to perfection!

19:27.758 --> 19:29.092
Eat it, Claire!

19:29.160 --> 19:32.295
Wait, so, how did dad's turkey
get in their suitcase?

19:32.363 --> 19:34.163
And where did that
small turkey come from?

19:34.198 --> 19:35.298
And how did you know
to come here?

19:35.366 --> 19:36.466
Dinner was supposed
to be at Claire's.

19:36.534 --> 19:37.934
All right, all right.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.602
It's like "The Caine mutiny" in here!

19:39.670 --> 19:41.870
Our vacation got canceled
at the last minute.

19:41.906 --> 19:44.541
We decided not to say anything
because we wanted a break.

19:44.608 --> 19:46.209
A br--
a break from what?!

19:46.277 --> 19:48.157
From Thanksgiving craziness.

19:48.179 --> 19:50.313
From -- from stress,
from yelling,

19:50.381 --> 19:52.549
from these two
parading around in dresses.

19:52.616 --> 19:55.016
- That was a one-time thing.
- Okay, we don't wear dresses at home.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.386
Now, look,
I get that Thanksgiving

19:56.454 --> 19:58.454
is a big day for families
who never see each other,

19:58.456 --> 20:00.924
but this group
is together non-stop.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.392
Look, why don't you

20:02.460 --> 20:04.761
take the suitcase turkey
home with you?

20:04.829 --> 20:06.963
You take the backpack turkey.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.032
We'll order a pizza,
and we'll all call it a night.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.567
- Fine. - Okay, fine.
- That sounds great. All right.

20:10.634 --> 20:11.801
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

20:11.869 --> 20:13.709
I know I seem like
the last person to say this,

20:13.738 --> 20:15.938
but we can't just skip
Thanksgiving!

20:15.973 --> 20:17.774
Time is going by so fast.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.282
It seemed like only yesterday
that Manny was hot for me,

20:20.344 --> 20:21.444
and he's not anymore.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.380
And someday,
Alex may have a boyfriend

20:23.447 --> 20:25.548
who wants her to spend it
with his family.

20:25.616 --> 20:27.083
Okay, we probably got
a little window there.

20:27.151 --> 20:29.786
But my point is
that I love my crazy family,

20:29.854 --> 20:32.122
and I want to spend
this holiday with them.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.690
- Ay.
- Ohh.

20:33.758 --> 20:36.238
If you want a break,
we can skip Christmas.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.861
- Fine. Settled.
- Okay. Sí.

20:37.928 --> 20:39.808
- Skip Christmas.
- Mitchell: Okay, cool. We're good.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.565
I already had plans
to spend Christmas

20:41.632 --> 20:42.912
in Cabo with my friends.

20:43.234 --> 20:44.601
I've got to get out of here.

20:48.698 --> 20:50.878
Why did we eat
all three turkeys?

20:51.113 --> 20:53.548
I hope that Thanksgiving's
on a Friday next year,

20:53.616 --> 20:55.950
so that I can sleep
through the entire weekend.

20:56.018 --> 20:58.753
Mom, can you take this one?
I'm exhausted.

20:58.821 --> 21:01.355
Wow, you really must be.

21:02.230 --> 21:03.763
Phil, give it up.

21:03.787 --> 21:06.887
Honey, you can dance all you want,

21:06.911 --> 21:08.711
but you're not fooling anyone.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.735
<i>Continue to whip, vigorously, Phillip</i>

21:10.759 --> 21:12.759
<i>until your meringue stiffens.</i>

21:12.783 --> 21:15.383
- That's hilarious, I don't--
- Are the cheeks turning nice and pink?

21:15.407 --> 21:17.107
What's the problem?

21:17.231 --> 21:19.131
<i>Now plunge into cold water.</i>

21:19.155 --> 21:21.155
I was just about
to suggest the same thing.
