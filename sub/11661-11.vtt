01:04.233 --> 01:07.033
Blanche, your picture's in the paper,

01:07.100 --> 01:09.600
and there's a big article
about the citrus festival.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.500
What's it say?

01:13.367 --> 01:17.000
"Miami will be busy this weekend
with 10 major conventions..."

01:17.066 --> 01:17.967
Listen to this.

01:18.033 --> 01:22.166
"The highlight
being the citrus festival ball,

01:22.233 --> 01:26.700
which is being chaired this year
by 35-year-old Blanche Devereaux."

01:26.767 --> 01:27.567
(sighs)

01:32.767 --> 01:33.533
(chuckles)

01:34.033 --> 01:35.567
How much did that cost you?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.767
I don't have to pay for my compliments.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.033
You went to bed with him?

01:43.333 --> 01:44.033
Twice.

01:46.133 --> 01:48.000
But it's not like I wouldn't have anyway.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.200
Oh, good. The newspaper's here.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.800
Give me the classifieds.

01:52.867 --> 01:56.834
You're not going to answer ads
in the personals again, are you?

01:56.900 --> 01:59.200
We got a lot of complaints last time.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.734
He wanted a female who likes to party,
and he got one.

02:06.567 --> 02:08.500
No. I need to make some extra money.

02:08.567 --> 02:09.433
What for?

02:09.500 --> 02:12.667
At my age,
the quality of your life changes.

02:12.734 --> 02:16.000
I'm here alone all day. It gets lonely.

02:16.066 --> 02:18.100
I could stay home more.

02:18.166 --> 02:20.600
Or we could get a giant-screen TV.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.033
Oh, Ma, we can't afford that.

02:24.100 --> 02:27.467
The classifieds are filled with ads

02:27.533 --> 02:29.967
from people who couldn't find a hotel room
this weekend

02:30.033 --> 02:32.834
and want to rent a room anyplace they can.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.166
I'm not taking in boarders.

02:35.233 --> 02:38.867
They usually turn out to be lowlife trash.

02:38.934 --> 02:41.667
Half the time,
you can't get your money from them.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.567
Which reminds me, Rose,
your rent check is late.

02:45.066 --> 02:46.800
(telephone rings)

02:46.867 --> 02:47.934
Hello.

02:48.433 --> 02:49.500
Yes, she is.

02:49.567 --> 02:50.767
It's for you, Leona.

02:54.533 --> 02:56.200
-Who is it?
-Your father.

02:56.266 --> 02:57.233
Big daddy!

02:57.300 --> 02:58.633
Is that you, Big Daddy?

02:58.700 --> 03:00.700
Hello, darling. How are you?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:04.200 --> 03:04.867
(chuckles)

03:04.934 --> 03:07.667
But, darling,
I can't come see you this weekend.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.734
No, no, I mean it.
If it had been any other weekend...

03:13.100 --> 03:16.100
I know, but I'm queen of a ball.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.333
Isn't that something?
Here, listen to this.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.433
Quote, "The highlight being
the citrus festival ball,

03:22.500 --> 03:26.667
which is being chaired this year
by 35-year-old Blanche Devereaux."

03:28.367 --> 03:29.033
Twice.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.467
I probably would have anyway.

03:39.734 --> 03:41.934
I'm sorry I can't come see you
this weekend,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.900
but I'll check in with you on Monday.

03:44.667 --> 03:45.967
I love you, too.

03:46.367 --> 03:47.467
Bye.

03:47.533 --> 03:48.800
How is Big Daddy?

03:48.867 --> 03:52.900
He's a little blue,
but when this festival's over,

03:52.967 --> 03:56.367
I'll fly to Atlanta
and spend some time with him.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.033
Look.

03:58.100 --> 04:02.066
Here's a couple that's willing to pay
$400 a night for a room.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.600
$400?

04:04.100 --> 04:08.166
Back in St. Olaf,
the most expensive room is $18.50,

04:08.233 --> 04:10.133
and that includes the cow.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.367
All right, Rose,
why would you want a cow in the room?

04:17.934 --> 04:18.934
It's the law.

04:21.433 --> 04:24.433
(light music playing)

04:29.734 --> 04:31.767
(gasps)
Thank you so much.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.300
Everybody, get in here!

04:34.367 --> 04:36.567
Come see what I just got!

04:36.633 --> 04:37.934
What is it, Blanche?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.700
My commemorative plate
from the citrus festival arrived.

04:41.767 --> 04:42.867
Can I see it?

04:42.934 --> 04:45.367
No, darling. Nobody must touch it.

04:45.433 --> 04:46.767
It is very rare.

04:46.834 --> 04:50.433
Only the five people on the committee
get these each year.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.800
Oh, look.

04:54.767 --> 04:58.000
Have you ever seen
a more moving piece of art?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.066
Only at Graceland.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.734
(Blanche) Yes.

05:03.567 --> 05:04.834
See what it says?

05:04.900 --> 05:07.133
(telephone rings)

05:07.867 --> 05:08.867
Hello.

05:08.934 --> 05:09.834
Who's calling?

05:10.433 --> 05:12.333
Oh, hi. Hang on.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.066
Blanche, it's your sister Virginia.

05:14.467 --> 05:18.133
Oh, for goodness. Virginia, is that you?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.333
The whole family's coming out
of the woodwork.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.633
Guess what.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.500
I'm queen of a ball.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.300
Twice.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.934
I probably would have anyway.

05:36.233 --> 05:36.900
What?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.600
I spoke to Big Daddy just yesterday.

05:41.100 --> 05:41.867
I see.

05:44.066 --> 05:46.133
All right. I'll be there as soon as I can.

05:48.533 --> 05:49.500
Blanche, what is it?

05:50.200 --> 05:51.667
Oh, it's Big Daddy.

05:52.033 --> 05:53.133
He's dead.

05:55.633 --> 05:58.633
(somber music playing)

06:03.567 --> 06:07.767
If you're as friendly as your skies are,
I'd love to get together sometime.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.200
(laughs)
All right. Bye.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.667
I have a flight to Atlanta
first thing tomorrow.

06:18.734 --> 06:23.667
Are you sure
you don't want one of us to go with you?

06:23.734 --> 06:26.233
Don't be silly. I'm fine.

06:26.300 --> 06:30.200
I'll fly to Atlanta,
tell Big Daddy I love him,

06:30.266 --> 06:32.900
and return to be queen of the ball.

06:35.033 --> 06:36.900
Blanche, you can't do that.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.700
Why not? Big daddy isn't dead.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.734
Virginia's playing a practical joke.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.133
Who plays a joke like that?

06:46.200 --> 06:48.800
You wanna play a joke,
ring a doorbell and run.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.100
Or shorten the leg on someone's walker
so it wobbles.

06:54.734 --> 06:58.166
Or arrange for someone
to go on a car trip with Rose.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.400
Don't tell them their father's dead.

07:04.467 --> 07:08.100
Big daddy didn't sound sick
when we talked.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.734
He was just missing me.

07:10.367 --> 07:14.200
Virginia always says I'm not there
when the family needs me.

07:14.266 --> 07:16.567
This is her way of getting me home.

07:16.633 --> 07:18.333
Everything's fine.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.000
I still think I'd better go with you.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.834
Whatever you want to do.

07:23.900 --> 07:26.533
(chuckles)
Ketchup to go on my lima beans.

07:27.066 --> 07:27.900
Why?

07:27.967 --> 07:30.033
He sometimes ate them that way.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.266
He'd say that's how the royalty of Europe
ate them.

07:34.734 --> 07:37.166
He always made it sound so special.

07:38.734 --> 07:44.233
He always made everything
sound so damned special.

07:45.066 --> 07:45.934
(sobs)

07:46.000 --> 07:48.133
God, why didn't I go when he called?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.734
Why didn't I go?

07:51.066 --> 07:53.000
Easy, easy.

07:53.066 --> 07:56.066
(sad music playing)

07:58.433 --> 08:00.400
This is the living room.

08:00.467 --> 08:04.033
Blanche, it's lovely.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.033
I'll check the water for the tea.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.467
There's so many memories in this room.

08:09.533 --> 08:12.100
We had family reunions in here.

08:12.533 --> 08:17.266
Generations would gather around Big Daddy
with his bourbon and branch.

08:17.333 --> 08:22.533
While he sat in front of the fire
regaling us with old-south stories.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.200
I'd sneak away
to make out with cousin Abernathy.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.600
The room has that sense of tradition.

08:32.767 --> 08:33.600
Virginia.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.667
Hello, Blanche. Dorothy.

08:35.734 --> 08:37.834
So sorry about your father.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.867
Thank you for coming.

08:39.934 --> 08:42.767
I'm making some tea.
Anybody want anything else?

08:42.834 --> 08:46.834
I'm too upset to eat.
I may never eat again.

08:46.900 --> 08:47.767
Blanche.

08:47.834 --> 08:51.467
I should keep up my strength.
Dorothy, something with frosting.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.934
Come give me a big hug.

08:57.433 --> 09:00.967
It's too late to share a beautiful moment.

09:01.033 --> 09:03.000
Where were you, Blanche? He wanted you.

09:03.066 --> 09:05.433
He didn't sound that sick on the phone.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.967
I told him I'd see him soon.

09:08.033 --> 09:10.367
Don't get so righteous.

09:10.433 --> 09:12.934
Sometimes you weren't there for him.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.233
What?

09:14.300 --> 09:16.867
You always make me out as inconsiderate.

09:16.934 --> 09:21.400
I remember when you were 16
and missed Father's Day.

09:21.467 --> 09:23.133
I was at school.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.734
Oh, yes, the good Samaritan Academy
for the knocked up.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.734
2, 4, 6, 8.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.200
All us girls are three months' late.

09:38.433 --> 09:40.500
That was wonderful for him.

09:41.166 --> 09:46.266
It didn't hurt him as much as when
you went to Europe with Phil at 18.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.000
It was Philippe.

09:48.066 --> 09:51.300
Big daddy understood how romantic it was
living in Copenhagen

09:51.367 --> 09:52.600
with a tortured painter.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.500
He painted houses, Blanche.

09:58.367 --> 10:01.867
You've never been here for the family.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.433
I have always been here for this family.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.834
Everything you do is for Blanche.

10:07.900 --> 10:12.000
I'm surprised you made it
to the funeral at all.

10:12.066 --> 10:14.567
Maybe you would be happier if I hadn't.

10:14.633 --> 10:19.433
Not happier,
but maybe we could grieve for Big Daddy

10:19.500 --> 10:22.000
without wondering
what's in it for Blanche.

10:22.066 --> 10:22.867
Oh, fine.

10:23.233 --> 10:27.000
You won't have to think about Blanche

10:27.066 --> 10:29.700
because if you'll be at that funeral,
I won't.

10:35.533 --> 10:38.567
(mellow music playing)

10:42.467 --> 10:45.133
Let's go over the rules.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.600
You share the bathroom
with the people in Dorothy's room.

10:47.667 --> 10:50.900
You can use the pool across the street.

10:50.967 --> 10:53.600
They're our friends,
so pick up after yourselves.

10:59.166 --> 11:00.033
Hello.

11:00.100 --> 11:00.867
Hi.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.967
I'm sorry, but you're not supposed to eat
off that plate.

11:10.033 --> 11:12.400
That's Blanche's citrus festival plate.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.367
Are you staying here, too?

11:16.433 --> 11:20.734
We're at the end of the hall.
I'm Peter. This is Maddy.

11:20.800 --> 11:21.767
Which room is yours?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.100
I'd better check.

11:26.967 --> 11:31.400
Why are Peter and Maddy
staying in Blanche's room?

11:31.467 --> 11:34.533
Dorothy's room and your room
are already rented.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.600
Where am I going to sleep?

11:37.667 --> 11:39.333
Rent half of my room.

11:40.467 --> 11:44.600
-You can't do this. Dorothy said--
-Forget what Dorothy said.

11:44.667 --> 11:47.934
Should I kick them out?
There's not a room in town.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.433
These people come from a small town
in Iowa, much like St. Olaf.

11:54.867 --> 11:55.567
Really?

11:56.600 --> 11:58.800
I don't lie about stuff like this.

12:01.166 --> 12:04.266
Those townspeople saved and sacrificed

12:04.333 --> 12:09.033
so Peter and Maddy could have one weekend
before his operation.

12:11.166 --> 12:12.767
He looks fine.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.700
Aw, tell him that.

12:17.934 --> 12:19.200
Call me crazy,

12:19.266 --> 12:22.433
there's nothing wrong
with giving a veteran his last wish

12:22.500 --> 12:23.667
and making some dough.

12:25.567 --> 12:27.633
I guess they can stay.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.533
Thanks.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.934
Take this out there. Make sure they pay.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.767
We shouldn't charge them.

12:33.834 --> 12:36.300
I know, but he hates pity.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.900
I understand.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.033
What a tool.

12:45.166 --> 12:48.200
(mellow music playing)

12:53.967 --> 12:58.633
Blanche, there's still time
to get to the funeral.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.500
Look at these old pictures.

13:00.567 --> 13:04.800
I must be 10 in this one.
Big daddy taught me to ride a horse.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.000
(both laugh)

13:06.066 --> 13:09.834
You were quite a little porker back then,
weren't you?

13:12.033 --> 13:14.100
I was a little chunky.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.834
Blanche, the horse's eyes are crossed.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.767
(laughs)

13:24.200 --> 13:25.900
You were fat.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.767
Every girl goes through that ugly stage.

13:29.834 --> 13:33.166
Ugly, yes. But this is ugly and fat.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.033
(laughs)

13:35.734 --> 13:36.934
All right.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.967
(chuckles)

13:39.033 --> 13:42.333
You're getting
a little too much pleasure out of this.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.266
I'm sorry.

13:43.333 --> 13:47.433
But you've always described yourself
as being a great beauty,

13:47.500 --> 13:49.300
and it's interesting
to see that you were...

13:49.367 --> 13:50.400
-Plump.
-Fat.

13:52.133 --> 13:52.934
Enough.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.400
I'm sorry.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.667
Fat, fat, water rat,
50 bullets in your hat.

14:00.867 --> 14:01.600
Dorothy.

14:01.667 --> 14:06.633
All right, I'll stop.
But could I have a copy of this?

14:08.967 --> 14:12.200
Okay, I was fat. I can say it.

14:12.266 --> 14:16.367
But only because I became
the extraordinary woman I am today.

14:17.066 --> 14:18.767
Big Daddy didn't care.

14:18.834 --> 14:20.467
He always said I was beautiful.

14:21.033 --> 14:22.000
He was so proud.

14:24.266 --> 14:27.900
There's nobody to be proud of me anymore,
do you know what I mean?

14:28.000 --> 14:28.667
Yeah.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.967
When anything good happens,
I still can't wait to tell Ma.

14:33.867 --> 14:37.200
Blanche, I think you have to go
to the funeral.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.500
You wanted to be there for him,
be there now.

14:40.567 --> 14:44.300
Don't let this argument stop you.

14:44.367 --> 14:48.867
You'll never feel complete
until you get to say goodbye.

14:48.934 --> 14:50.100
You don't understand.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.100
If I go, he's dead.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.600
Blanche, he is.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.467
This was when I was crowned Azalea queen.

14:57.533 --> 14:58.800
Wasn't I beautiful then?

14:58.867 --> 15:00.867
You still haven't lost it.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.700
-This was taken two years after I lost it.
-Oh.

15:08.000 --> 15:08.734
Look.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.266
(both laugh)

15:11.433 --> 15:15.066
<i>♪ The first marine</i>
<i>He found the bean, parlez-vous ♪</i>

15:15.133 --> 15:18.834

15:18.900 --> 15:20.667

15:25.433 --> 15:28.934
(laughter)

15:31.166 --> 15:33.433
Ah, nice people.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.867
You didn't say anything about parties
in the house.

15:36.934 --> 15:39.400
Peter and Maddy are having
some friends over.

15:39.467 --> 15:40.600
We're making a bundle.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.467
I wish we'd thought
of putting in a pay toilet.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.500
(telephone rings)

15:52.333 --> 15:53.200
Hello.

15:53.867 --> 15:55.266
It was Dorothy. Hide me.

15:58.567 --> 16:00.333
(telephone rings)

16:00.400 --> 16:01.467
Rose, you answer it.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.100
No.

16:03.166 --> 16:06.133
I won't lie for you. It's your daughter.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.700
We're not that close.

16:15.467 --> 16:17.867
Get it next time. She'll get mad.

16:17.934 --> 16:20.333
(telephone rings)

16:22.000 --> 16:24.667
(ring)

16:25.967 --> 16:28.233
(ring)

16:28.300 --> 16:29.033
Hello.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.300
Oh, hello, Dorothy.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.767
No, it didn't ring here, why?

16:38.266 --> 16:39.834
No, everything's fine.

16:39.900 --> 16:40.934
(chuckles)

16:41.033 --> 16:42.166
Sophia?

16:42.233 --> 16:43.400
(whispering)
Say I'm in church.

16:43.467 --> 16:44.834
(whispering)
She's in church.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.600
(normal voice)
I said she's in church.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.900
No, things couldn't be better here.

16:53.967 --> 16:54.934
How's it going there?

16:55.934 --> 16:57.200
Oh, that's good.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.900
See you tomorrow.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.100
Give my love to Blanche.

17:01.567 --> 17:02.900
Bye-bye.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.433
I hate lying.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.600
It goes against my nature.

17:07.667 --> 17:11.967
In St. Olaf, once a year,

17:12.033 --> 17:15.300
they'd gather all the children
who lied in the Town Square,

17:15.367 --> 17:17.400
and the mayor pointed at them.

17:24.633 --> 17:27.333
(glass shatter)

17:30.066 --> 17:31.834
Uh, you got any glue?

17:32.100 --> 17:33.066
Oh!

17:33.900 --> 17:35.400
Blanche's plate!

17:35.467 --> 17:36.800
What are we going to tell her?

17:36.867 --> 17:37.800
The truth.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.100
Good.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.667
I need a few minutes to come up with it.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.100
(mellow music playing)

17:56.934 --> 17:58.433
These are for you, Mama.

18:02.266 --> 18:03.333
Hi, Big Daddy.

18:04.433 --> 18:08.000
I couldn't go home without telling you
why I didn't come to your funeral.

18:10.100 --> 18:10.967
Same old reason.

18:11.033 --> 18:14.533
I was being selfish,
thinking too much about how I was feeling,

18:14.600 --> 18:18.300
instead of coming here
to pay my love and respects.

18:20.066 --> 18:24.433
You know,
going through those photograph albums,

18:24.500 --> 18:27.600
I realized I haven't always been
easy to love.

18:27.667 --> 18:28.333
(chuckle)

18:29.400 --> 18:34.467
Oh, I was a horrible child,
rebellious, difficult,

18:35.200 --> 18:39.467
but you always made me feel loved
and beautiful,

18:41.133 --> 18:43.500
even when I did make it hard on you.

18:44.433 --> 18:47.166
I haven't always given much back.

18:48.133 --> 18:50.367
I was always so worried about me.

18:51.300 --> 18:56.000
I couldn't even come and see you
when you needed me

18:56.066 --> 18:58.467
because I was caught up
in that silly ball.

18:58.533 --> 18:59.233
(scoffs)

18:59.700 --> 19:01.567
There is no excuse for that.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.767
But I was the ball queen.

19:04.834 --> 19:06.200
Did I tell you that?

19:07.367 --> 19:08.867
That's right, I did.

19:11.867 --> 19:14.734
Well, here I am all caught up in myself.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.800
Fighting with Virginia and the family
when we ought to be comforting each other.

19:20.467 --> 19:21.133
(scoffs)

19:22.333 --> 19:24.333
I just feel like such a fool.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.166
I would give up everything
that I ever thought meant anything to me

19:33.433 --> 19:35.867
if I could have one moment with you.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.233
I don't know if love can help you
wherever you are, but...

19:43.700 --> 19:45.767
If it can, honey, you got it.

19:47.266 --> 19:49.900
Big daddy, I do love you so much.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.867
I wish there was some way I could know
you're hearing what I'm saying.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.100
Blanche...

19:59.567 --> 20:00.767
Oh, Lordy.

20:06.533 --> 20:07.834
Dorothy, what are you doing?

20:07.900 --> 20:12.400
We'd better go
if we want to make our plane.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.433
Big daddy, you remember Dorothy.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.333
Hello.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.600
Honey, I have to go now.

20:20.734 --> 20:22.133
You're in my prayers.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.934
You take good care of him, Mama, hear me?

20:27.500 --> 20:28.233
I love you.

20:29.467 --> 20:30.567
I love you both.

20:35.066 --> 20:36.800
I'm nobody's little girl anymore.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
(sad music playing)

20:55.400 --> 20:56.500
(door opens)

20:56.567 --> 20:59.300
Rose, this was a great weekend.

20:59.367 --> 21:02.934
We made $1,700, so I can get my TV.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.033
I've decided what to say
about Blanche's plate.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.166
I wrote it down.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.233
You be Rose, and I'll be Sophia.

21:10.967 --> 21:13.567
This is what we'll say after they walk in.

21:14.033 --> 21:18.567
"Hi, Blanche. You look beautiful.
Welcome home. I love you."

21:19.633 --> 21:22.900
"I broke the plate.
I'm such a clumsy fool."

21:28.967 --> 21:30.767
Now skip down to here.

21:30.834 --> 21:32.400
I'm not doing this.

21:32.867 --> 21:34.467
-(doorbell rings)
-You've got to.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.066
If it's the writing, I can punch it up.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.300
Did you call about buying this plate?

21:43.367 --> 21:44.166
I did.

21:44.233 --> 21:46.400
Rose, you're beautiful.

21:46.467 --> 21:47.633
How much do you want?

21:47.700 --> 21:49.000
They're rare.

21:49.066 --> 21:52.567
There's only five of these.
I'd say $2,000.

21:53.333 --> 21:57.000
$2,000 a plate?
What is this, a republican fund raiser?

21:58.333 --> 22:00.300
These are collectors' items.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.967
I doing this because you're in a jam.

22:03.033 --> 22:06.233
We have $1,700 cash. That's it.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.333
I'll take it.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.633
Give him the money.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.066
But my TV.

22:11.633 --> 22:13.900
How about $100 and a good time?

22:18.800 --> 22:20.200
Give him the money.

22:22.233 --> 22:23.800
Nice doing business with you.

22:24.767 --> 22:25.633
(sighs)

22:25.700 --> 22:27.367
-Hello, everybody.
-Hello.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.367
Who was that?

22:28.433 --> 22:29.500
Gas man.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.400
It's so good to see you both home.

22:33.467 --> 22:35.700
We took good care of your plate.

22:35.767 --> 22:39.633
Oh, thanks! You know,
I became a new person on this trip.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.734
I realized we have so little time.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.033
We must cherish each moment.

22:45.467 --> 22:47.800
This plate represents the old me.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.200
I feel wonderful.

23:01.266 --> 23:02.867
I could go for some cheesecake.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.367
What is this, sarcasm?

23:15.066 --> 23:18.066
(upbeat music playing)

23:23.800 --> 23:26.834
(closing theme music playing)
