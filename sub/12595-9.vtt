<b>- It's a fictional wing that</b>
<b>I just tried to make appealing.</b>

16:11.659 --> 16:13.161
<b>- If you're gonna give somebody</b>
<b>wings on their back</b>

16:13.261 --> 16:14.729
<b>they got to be able to fly,</b>
<b>right?</b>

16:14.829 --> 16:15.697
<b>That's kind of the idea.</b>

16:15.797 --> 16:18.533
<b>- It's art, man.</b>
<b>No right or wrong.</b>

16:18.633 --> 16:19.934
<b>- There is a right or wrong.</b>
<b>- At least ours are big enough</b>

16:20.035 --> 16:21.469
<b>to get you off the ground.</b>

16:21.569 --> 16:23.004
<b>- Look, man, the anatomy on</b>
<b>this thing is questionable,</b>

16:23.104 --> 16:26.941
<b> <i>but the entrance where the wing</i> </b>
<b> <i>goes into the body is great.</i> </b>

16:27.042 --> 16:30.378
<b> <i>The texture in it,</i> </b>
<b> <i>putting all the small lines in</i> </b>

16:30.478 --> 16:31.598
<b> <i>and the heavy lines creating</i> </b>

16:31.679 --> 16:33.948
<b> <i>that dimension and depth, great.</i> </b>

16:34.015 --> 16:36.718
<b>Anybody who did less than this</b>
<b>in their wings,</b>

16:36.818 --> 16:37.818
<b>I'm coming for you.</b>

16:39.220 --> 16:41.456
<b>- Christian and Matti.</b>

16:43.124 --> 16:44.292
<b>- Christian,</b>
<b>I think you really shined.</b>

16:44.392 --> 16:48.029
<b> <i>This tattoo came out</i> </b>
<b> <i>super soft, super smooth.</i> </b>

16:48.129 --> 16:53.034
<b>Very meticulous shading</b>
<b>throughout every single feather.</b>

16:53.134 --> 16:54.536
<b> <i>- It looks like you can brush</i> </b>
<b> <i>it, you can feel it,</i> </b>

16:54.636 --> 16:56.404
<b>you can touch it, but the best</b>
<b>part of this thing is</b>

16:56.504 --> 17:00.208
<b> <i>when it heals, how soft</i> </b>
<b> <i>it's gonna actually look</i> </b>

17:00.308 --> 17:02.844
<b>in comparison to the dark side.</b>

17:02.977 --> 17:04.179
<b>- Matti.</b>
<b>- When you compare</b>

17:04.279 --> 17:06.513
<b> <i>just the two techniques from</i> </b>
<b> <i>Christian's to yours,</i> </b>

17:06.614 --> 17:08.916
<b>it's obvious this is Christian's</b>
<b>forte.</b>

17:09.017 --> 17:10.537
<b> <i>Basically it looks like you</i> </b>
<b> <i>tried to do</i> </b>

17:10.585 --> 17:12.753
<b> <i>the same kind of wing as him,</i> </b>
<b> <i>just darker.</i> </b>

17:12.921 --> 17:15.256
<b> <i>It is a little bit harder to</i> </b>
<b> <i>read the layers.</i> </b>

17:15.356 --> 17:17.092
<b> <i>Going with</i> </b>
<b> <i>the little black drips,</i> </b>

17:17.192 --> 17:19.227
<b>I guess that's just to add</b>
<b>a little bit of evil to it.</b>

17:19.327 --> 17:20.462
<b>- It's a wet texture, too,</b>

17:20.561 --> 17:21.963
<b>so it's just one more</b>
<b>I could throw in.</b>

17:22.063 --> 17:24.432
<b>- Overall, your wing alone,</b>
<b>just texture challenge,</b>

17:24.531 --> 17:25.467
<b>I don't think you really hit it.</b>

17:25.567 --> 17:27.007
<b>- Well, I got teamed</b>
<b>up with somebody</b>

17:27.035 --> 17:29.437
<b>who's pretty much the best in</b>
<b>the room at black and gray,</b>

17:29.537 --> 17:30.672
<b>and I tried to keep up.</b>

17:30.772 --> 17:32.941
<b>- Falling on the sword is</b>
<b>not the option.</b>

17:33.041 --> 17:35.610
<b>What I dislike here: You guys</b>
<b>shared one stencil.</b>

17:35.710 --> 17:36.444
<b> <i>One guy put points on it,</i> </b>
<b> <i>one guy didn't.</i> </b>

17:36.544 --> 17:38.413
<b> <i>It's a snooze-fest.</i> </b>

17:38.513 --> 17:41.082
<b>If you're here to compete,</b>
<b>compete.</b>

17:41.182 --> 17:42.951
<b>Do something exciting.</b>

17:45.387 --> 17:46.654
<b>- Sausage and Jesse.</b>

17:48.790 --> 17:51.459
<b>- The "evil versus good" thing</b>
<b>plays out well in these tattoos</b>

17:51.559 --> 17:53.962
<b> <i>because you have two completely</i> </b>
<b> <i>different style wings.</i> </b>

17:54.028 --> 17:57.365
<b> <i>You don't just have a lighter</i> </b>
<b> <i>version of each other going on.</i> </b>

17:57.465 --> 17:59.567
<b>But as far as the quality,</b>

17:59.667 --> 18:00.969
<b>you guys just didn't</b>
<b>work well together.</b>

18:01.036 --> 18:04.439
<b>- Jesse's super talented, and</b>
<b>he really goes for the wall.</b>

18:04.539 --> 18:05.373
<b>So I kind of reeled him in</b>
<b>a little bit</b>

18:05.473 --> 18:07.742
<b>so we could kind of work smart.</b>

18:07.909 --> 18:09.377
<b>- You pulling back the reins on</b>
<b>somebody who is creative</b>

18:09.477 --> 18:11.646
<b>is a missed opportunity for you.</b>

18:11.746 --> 18:14.149
<b>It shows heavily in your work.</b>

18:14.249 --> 18:16.351
<b> <i>It is flat.</i> </b> <b> <i>It is boring.</i> </b>

18:16.451 --> 18:18.586
<b> <i>It is tiny.</i> </b> <b> <i>It is textureless.</i> </b>

18:18.686 --> 18:21.289
<b>I can't stand it.</b>
<b>It looks six years old.</b>

18:21.389 --> 18:24.259
<b>It does not look like</b>
<b>a fresh Sausage tattoo.</b>

18:24.359 --> 18:25.639
<b> <i>- Wings are generally structured</i> </b>

18:25.693 --> 18:28.029
<b>with a lot of tight layers</b>
<b>of feathers.</b>

18:28.129 --> 18:29.998
<b> <i>Looking at your tattoo,</i> </b>
<b> <i>it's a little loose</i> </b>

18:30.098 --> 18:31.978
<b> <i>and the direction of</i> </b>
<b> <i>the feathers are haphazard.</i> </b>

18:32.067 --> 18:33.702
<b>I know you're trying to go</b>
<b>with a light texture,</b>

18:33.802 --> 18:36.171
<b>but your outline</b>
<b>came out a little light.</b>

18:36.271 --> 18:37.505
<b> <i>Where you have</i> </b>
<b> <i>the darker blue lines</i> </b>

18:37.605 --> 18:39.174
<b> <i>over the light blue shading,</i> </b>
<b> <i>this doesn't come off</i> </b>

18:39.274 --> 18:40.842
<b>as a texture feel.</b>

18:40.942 --> 18:43.278
<b> <i>Compared to Jesse's, just in</i> </b>
<b> <i>a one-on-one comparison,</i> </b>

18:43.378 --> 18:45.547
<b>the texture difference</b>
<b>stands out strongly.</b>

18:45.647 --> 18:47.649
<b> <i>Jesse, you did a great job</i> </b>

18:47.749 --> 18:48.950
<b> <i>on the texture part</i> </b>
<b> <i>of this challenge,</i> </b>

18:49.050 --> 18:50.518
<b>but it just didn't really</b>
<b>saturate this thing.</b>

18:50.618 --> 18:52.353
<b> <i>This light yellow is not solid.</i> </b>

18:52.454 --> 18:54.289
<b> <i>It's not gonna be bright</i> </b>
<b> <i>when this heals</i> </b>

18:54.389 --> 18:55.457
<b> <i>or for the long term.</i> </b>

18:55.557 --> 18:56.524
<b>- Two little mini-tats</b>
<b>on a girl's shoulder</b>

18:56.624 --> 18:58.560
<b>is your best attempt?</b>

18:58.660 --> 19:01.262
<b>- Sausage gets</b>
<b>stressed out real easy,</b>

19:01.362 --> 19:02.397
<b>and I just didn't want to put</b>

19:02.497 --> 19:03.865
<b>any extra pressure on him,</b>
<b>to be honest.</b>

19:03.965 --> 19:05.767
<b>- Don't get stifled by who</b>
<b>you work with here.</b>

19:05.900 --> 19:07.902
<b>Push them to catch up to you</b>
<b>because,</b>

19:07.936 --> 19:10.004
<b>hey, man, worst tattoo</b>
<b>of the day goes home.</b>

19:12.474 --> 19:13.908
<b>- Jime and Anthony.</b>

19:16.511 --> 19:18.079
<b>- The size overall</b>
<b>is impressive.</b>

19:18.179 --> 19:20.915
<b> <i>The shape, that they fit to</i> </b>
<b> <i>the top of the body is nice.</i> </b>

19:21.015 --> 19:23.385
<b> <i>The main critique that I have</i> </b>
<b> <i>about the way these things</i> </b>

19:23.485 --> 19:24.986
<b> <i>go together is the center.</i> </b>

19:25.086 --> 19:27.489
<b> <i>You know, they're so different</i> </b>
<b> <i>on how Jime's meets the skin</i> </b>

19:27.589 --> 19:29.791
<b> <i>and how Anthony's</i> </b>
<b> <i>meets the skin.</i> </b>

19:29.924 --> 19:31.960
<b>If Jime could have brought that</b>
<b>little shading underneath it</b>

19:32.060 --> 19:34.162
<b>to give it that same pop,</b>
<b>I think it would have made</b>

19:34.262 --> 19:37.232
<b> <i>a really dynamic difference on</i> </b>
<b> <i>the overall look of this tattoo</i> </b>

19:37.332 --> 19:39.652
<b>and the cohesiveness of how it</b>
<b>came together in the center.</b>

19:39.734 --> 19:43.438
<b>For Jime's side,</b>
<b>for being so dark,</b>

19:43.538 --> 19:45.473
<b>you missed that opportunity</b>

19:45.573 --> 19:47.709
<b>to use that darkness</b>
<b>to show layers.</b>

19:47.809 --> 19:49.844
<b> <i>It just looks like stripes.</i> </b>

19:49.944 --> 19:52.981
<b> <i>The spikes you put in there</i> </b>
<b> <i>don't really stand out strong.</i> </b>

19:53.081 --> 19:54.749
<b> <i>From a distance you don't</i> </b>
<b> <i>hardly even see them.</i> </b>

19:54.849 --> 19:56.951
<b> <i>The bottom three-quarters of</i> </b>
<b> <i>this tattoo</i> </b>

19:57.052 --> 19:58.386
<b> <i>just looks rushed in.</i> </b>

19:58.486 --> 19:59.487
<b>- You're fighting against</b>
<b>someone</b>

19:59.587 --> 20:00.989
<b>working on the opposite end</b>
<b>of you,</b>

20:01.089 --> 20:02.323
<b>and you're fighting</b>
<b>the time clock, you know?</b>

20:02.424 --> 20:04.426
<b>- You chose the size.</b>
<b>- We completely... we did.</b>

20:04.526 --> 20:07.729
<b>No, I'm not... I mean...</b>
<b>I mean, I did what I did.</b>

20:07.896 --> 20:09.597
<b>- Anthony.</b>
<b>- This tattoo really sits well.</b>

20:09.697 --> 20:11.399
<b> <i>It's put in very nicely.</i> </b>

20:11.499 --> 20:14.669
<b> <i>I like the small details and</i> </b>
<b> <i>outlines that you put into it.</i> </b>

20:14.769 --> 20:17.105
<b>The really soft accents you have</b>

20:17.205 --> 20:18.606
<b> <i>on the top crest of the wing</i> </b>
<b> <i>work really nicely.</i> </b>

20:18.707 --> 20:22.043
<b>You can feel the layers.</b>
<b>You can feel the feathers.</b>

<b>the best tattoo of the day.</b>

20:28.917 --> 20:31.352
<b>- For me there's a few</b>
<b>shining moments of texture</b>

20:31.453 --> 20:32.987
<b>throughout all these tattoos.</b>

20:33.088 --> 20:34.689
<b>Certain moments of James'</b>
<b>really stand out for texture.</b>

20:34.789 --> 20:37.726
<b>Jesse has some nice little</b>
<b>textures thrown in there.</b>

20:37.826 --> 20:40.662
<b>But Christian's uniformly</b>
<b>looks nice throughout.</b>

20:40.762 --> 20:42.564
<b>It looks soft.</b>
<b>It looks like a feather.</b>

20:42.664 --> 20:45.100
<b>Technically, I think it's</b>
<b>the strongest tattoo of the day.</b>

20:45.200 --> 20:48.069
<b>- I agree. Christian did</b>
<b>an amazing tattoo today.</b>

20:48.169 --> 20:51.005
<b>However, James stepped outside</b>
<b>of the box the furthest</b>

20:51.106 --> 20:53.174
<b> <i>and showed multitude of texture.</i> </b>

20:53.274 --> 20:54.542
<b>- He really did.</b>

20:54.642 --> 20:56.811
<b>- My final decision is</b>
<b>for James Vaughn.</b>

20:56.945 --> 20:59.180
<b>- It's gonna be tough,</b>
<b>but I don't appreciate</b>

36:53.993 --> 36:55.628

38:48.408 --> 38:50.443
<b> <i>is posing</i> </b>
<b> <i>for his passport photo.</i> </b>

38:50.543 --> 38:52.345
<b> <i>Matti's looks like it just got</i> </b>
<b> <i>whacked off the shoulders</i> </b>

38:52.445 --> 38:53.680
<b> <i>with a baseball bat.</i> </b>

38:53.780 --> 38:55.515
<b>- Yeah, his is</b>
<b>really exciting but, man,</b>

38:55.615 --> 38:57.450
<b>I sure do like the idea</b>
<b>that I just went</b>

38:57.550 --> 38:59.185
<b>balls to the wall</b>
<b>with the texture.</b>

38:59.285 --> 39:02.221
<b>- You guys asked us for</b>
<b>dynamic, creative tattoos,</b>

39:02.322 --> 39:04.457
<b>and I came out tattooing</b>
<b>with a Louisville Slugger</b>

39:04.557 --> 39:05.325
<b>instead of a tattoo machine.</b>

39:05.425 --> 39:08.328
<b>I did an awesome [bleep] tattoo.</b>

39:08.428 --> 39:10.563
<b>- We have to vote</b>
<b>on texture obviously,</b>

39:10.663 --> 39:12.665
<b>but we also have to just go on</b>
<b>best tattoo of the day.</b>

39:12.765 --> 39:16.502
<b>I see Sausage having more</b>
<b>examples of texture,</b>

39:16.603 --> 39:20.974
<b>and I see Matti delivering</b>
<b>a more appealing tattoo.</b>

39:21.140 --> 39:22.141
<b>- It's glossy.</b> <b>One's muted down,</b>

39:22.242 --> 39:23.710
<b>the other one's just ramped up.</b>

39:23.810 --> 39:25.979
<b>- Sausage, I love the details</b>
<b>you put in it</b>

39:26.145 --> 39:28.014
<b> <i>but I don't think you had</i> </b>
<b> <i>a good exit strategy</i> </b>

39:28.147 --> 39:29.616
<b>for the back of this tattoo.</b>

39:29.716 --> 39:32.452

39:35.088 --> 39:36.823

39:38.992 --> 39:40.760

39:40.860 --> 39:42.295
<b>- Chris.</b>

39:44.230 --> 39:46.299
<b>- Sausage.</b>

39:46.399 --> 39:48.434

39:50.970 --> 39:53.473

<b>Sausage,</b>

39:53.573 --> 39:56.342
<b>you do not have what</b>

39:58.111 --> 40:00.313
