WEBVTT

00:57.787 --> 00:59.106
Damn it!

01:04.087 --> 01:06.204
Son of a bitch.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.836
You look where you're going?
You almost killed me.

01:08.836 --> 01:09.907
I barely tapped you.

01:09.907 --> 01:10.951
You rammed my bumper, man.

01:10.951 --> 01:12.835
Let the insurance companies
take care of this.

01:12.835 --> 01:14.107
Just give me your information.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.413
Yeah, like hell.
You give me yours. / Fine.

01:16.413 --> 01:18.207
Here, idiot.

01:18.688 --> 01:19.687
Back off.

01:19.687 --> 01:21.392
Hand it over. / I said back off!

01:21.711 --> 01:24.129
Back off! / Get your hands off me.

02:08.570 --> 02:09.699
Excuse me.

02:10.735 --> 02:11.973
Excuse me.

02:14.210 --> 02:15.926
Would you mind I asked
you a few questions?

02:15.926 --> 02:18.015
Everybody's been asking
me questions today.

02:18.015 --> 02:21.946
Because it helps our witnesses
have fresh memories.

02:22.219 --> 02:24.849
I memorized the alphabet.

02:29.395 --> 02:32.349
You did? That's good.
That's not easy, is it?

02:32.349 --> 02:33.863
No. / No.

02:34.259 --> 02:37.615
no. My name is Horatio.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.785
- What's yours, buddy?
- It's not buddy.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.935
It's Eugene thomas walters.

02:42.935 --> 02:44.448
Eugene.

02:44.745 --> 02:46.544
I saw everything.

02:47.275 --> 02:49.375
What can you tell me about the
man who held the gun,

02:49.375 --> 02:51.340
who did the shooting?
Did you see his face?

02:51.340 --> 02:52.979
Colton.

02:52.979 --> 02:55.196
Colton. So, you know his name.

02:55.196 --> 02:56.714
Do you know him?

02:57.240 --> 03:00.264
No. I saw everything.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.468
He had clean windows.

03:02.468 --> 03:04.178
His windows were clean.

03:04.178 --> 03:05.514
Yes...

03:05.514 --> 03:08.344
Eugene, will you do me a favor?

03:08.344 --> 03:09.515
Would you wait right here?

03:09.515 --> 03:11.212
Yes. / Okay.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.444
Is Eugene our only witness?

03:18.444 --> 03:19.783
Yes, he is.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.426
I'm guessing he's mental age is about...

03:22.426 --> 03:23.702
seven or eight. / Mm-hmm.

03:23.702 --> 03:24.960
It's called pre-logic.

03:24.960 --> 03:30.607
He has a difficulty distinguishing
between fantasy and reality.

03:30.607 --> 03:32.128
But he says he saw everything.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.393
Yeah. That's what he says...

03:35.785 --> 03:37.654
and that...

03:37.937 --> 03:39.868
is going to be the challenge.

04:15.337 --> 04:18.574
MIAMI
2x12 Witness To Murder

04:31.654 --> 04:34.647
Okay. Our victim's name
is Richard beckham.

04:34.647 --> 04:37.077
Let's find out everything
we can about him, all right?

04:37.077 --> 04:40.016
If he works in the building
or was just visiting.

04:40.016 --> 04:41.202
What about our witness?

04:41.202 --> 04:43.797
He does have information
on our suspect, Colton.

04:43.797 --> 04:46.088
No jury would find Eugine competent,

04:46.088 --> 04:47.899
and I don't want to put
him through that, all right?

04:47.899 --> 04:49.492
A witness is a witness. / Right.

04:49.492 --> 04:51.484
Let's stay with the evidence.

04:51.484 --> 04:52.983
You got it. / All right.

04:55.915 --> 05:00.319
People might play nicer with a fender bender
if they realized that three out of ten people

05:00.319 --> 05:02.099
stash a gun in their car.

05:02.734 --> 05:04.537
That true? / Yup.

05:05.216 --> 05:08.403
Then I'll think a little harder
next time I flip someone the bird.

05:10.439 --> 05:12.565
That glass belong to the bad guy's car?

05:12.565 --> 05:16.843
There's no broken lights
on the victim's car, so... / Whoa...

05:16.843 --> 05:19.813
found something else that
might belong to the bad guy.

05:25.185 --> 05:26.973
380 beretta tomcat.

05:27.773 --> 05:30.091
That's what I like about criminals.

05:30.091 --> 05:31.296
Not the brightest.

05:31.296 --> 05:33.921
Leaving a murder weapon at the scene.
That's good.

05:33.921 --> 05:35.951
Unless it's not the murder weapon.

05:36.492 --> 05:39.485
Why is that? / It's fully loaded.

05:39.485 --> 05:41.794
Maybe there was one in the chamber.

05:44.465 --> 05:47.970
Well, the only way to tell for sure
if this is the actual murder weapon

05:47.970 --> 05:49.966
is to find the bullet and the casing.

05:50.844 --> 05:52.626
Then start looking...

05:53.713 --> 05:55.506
Because we got a through-and-through.

05:57.934 --> 06:00.013
Got another D.B. Gentlemen?

06:00.013 --> 06:01.121
Yes, ma'am.

06:01.743 --> 06:03.111
See you later, Calleigh.

06:08.531 --> 06:11.577
African american girl,
could be in her teens.

06:12.088 --> 06:13.382
Who called it in?

06:13.382 --> 06:15.721
Couple of snowbirds from Ottawa

06:15.721 --> 06:17.607
on their way to lauderdale for the winter.

06:17.607 --> 06:20.449
Stopped to stretch their legs,
and they found her instead.

06:20.449 --> 06:22.784
Why isn't Broward county handling this?

06:22.784 --> 06:25.781
'Cause county line is 500 yards that way.

06:27.623 --> 06:31.114
- Welcome to the boonies.
- Oh, sweetheart,

06:31.114 --> 06:35.698
you should be out chasing
boys and learning cheers...

06:37.318 --> 06:38.976
not here with me.

06:43.856 --> 06:46.889
Jenny kincaid. 16.

06:47.308 --> 06:49.860
Money's gone... they left the wallet.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.856
Robbery gone bad?

06:51.856 --> 06:55.751
I don't even think the murder
was committed here. Look.

06:57.490 --> 06:59.419
Double lividity.

07:00.524 --> 07:03.213
Yeah, they probably brought
her here lying on one side,

07:03.213 --> 07:04.593
dumped her lying on the other.

07:04.593 --> 07:06.356
Blood settled twice.

07:06.356 --> 07:08.327
Her neck looks like it's been broken.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.888
Trauma or a fall?

07:10.888 --> 07:13.446
I'll know better when we get
her back for the post.

07:18.399 --> 07:20.720
That weather's coming in pretty fast.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.959
You willing to hold off on trace?

07:24.959 --> 07:28.869
- I am if you are.
- I'll do the rest at post.

08:31.602 --> 08:33.082
I knew you'd be waiting.

08:33.082 --> 08:34.323
Probative?

08:34.706 --> 08:36.818
There was no bullet in the parking structure,

08:36.818 --> 08:38.880
so I'm going to go to the lab and
check for prints on the gun.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.255
I'll let you know if I find anything.

08:40.255 --> 08:41.796
Okay, do that. / Okay.

08:43.067 --> 08:44.234
Eugene.

08:44.234 --> 08:45.568
Hi.

08:48.274 --> 08:49.556
Eugene, what are you doing here?

08:49.556 --> 08:52.052
A policeman drove me here.

08:52.052 --> 08:53.561
You, you left me.

08:53.561 --> 08:56.307
I, I'm continuing with the investigation.

08:56.307 --> 08:58.284
Well, I saw everything.

08:58.284 --> 08:59.692
Don't you want my help?

08:59.692 --> 09:01.747
I do want your help. Um...

09:02.585 --> 09:04.938
I'm smarter than people think I am.

09:04.938 --> 09:06.912
All right, have you...

09:07.675 --> 09:10.553
have you ever looked at mug shots? / Yeah.

09:11.409 --> 09:12.901
What are mug shots?

09:12.901 --> 09:14.524
You know what? Let's go find out.

09:14.524 --> 09:17.593
Let's look at some, all right?
Come on.

09:22.239 --> 09:23.786
Colton's not in here.

09:23.786 --> 09:25.990
All right, you konw, sometimes...

09:25.990 --> 09:28.755
sometimes people look different in pictures.

09:28.755 --> 09:30.798
Then how do you know it's them?

09:33.446 --> 09:37.284
That... that is an excellent point.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.315
I think I'm too confused.

09:43.803 --> 09:46.863
Okay. / It's 'cause I...

09:47.216 --> 09:49.626
was sick when I was little.

09:49.626 --> 09:50.852
I got a fever.

09:50.852 --> 09:52.905
Eugene, you did fine.

09:52.905 --> 09:54.760
You did great.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.159
I want to be able to do a real job, like you.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.350
Eugene...

10:05.281 --> 10:07.706
Eugene, what do you remember...

10:07.706 --> 10:10.498
what do you remember
about the car that got hit?

10:10.498 --> 10:11.806
It was silver.

10:11.806 --> 10:16.750
A silver car with heavy
weights and towels and...

10:17.285 --> 10:21.031
a jump rope, and... lots of bottles...

10:21.031 --> 10:27.637
Oh, oh, one of those big gigantic rubber
bands and lots of bottles of water.

10:27.637 --> 10:29.716
And these things were inside the car..

10:29.716 --> 10:31.664
Yeah, inside the car.

10:31.664 --> 10:36.758
And you know this because you washed
the silver car's windows, didn't you?

10:37.564 --> 10:39.975
I wash people's windows all the time.

10:39.975 --> 10:41.543
Some people yell at me.

10:41.543 --> 10:43.046
Some people give me quarters.

10:43.046 --> 10:45.681
- Hang on, buddy.
- I got a vermont quarter.

10:45.681 --> 10:47.718
I,I keep wanting a florida quarter,

10:47.718 --> 10:49.770
- Okay, hang on, buddy.
- But they're really hard to find.

10:49.770 --> 10:52.396
- I got it. Hang on.
- Florida quarters are hard.

10:52.396 --> 10:53.675
Yeah, Yelina, listen,

10:53.675 --> 10:57.202
I think our shooter may be a fitness trainer.

10:57.202 --> 10:59.488
Well, there's no gym in the building.

10:59.488 --> 11:02.590
I'll canvass and see if anyone
had an appointment with a trainer.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.491
Okay, what about our victim's office?

11:04.491 --> 11:06.265
Manager let me in.

11:06.265 --> 11:11.140
You'll be interested to know that
our victim was a diamond broker.

11:11.140 --> 11:12.256
Okay, here's what you do.

11:12.256 --> 11:15.904
Get a client list and find out
if he had a delivery today, all right?

11:15.904 --> 11:17.191
You got it.

11:19.539 --> 11:21.554
Nice going, Eugene.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.498
Alexx, what's up?
You forget about your boys, or what?

11:31.498 --> 11:33.162
No way, baby. Never.

11:33.162 --> 11:35.581
All right, so where's that
trace you promised us?

11:35.581 --> 11:37.100
The rest stop girl.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.900
Just finished post on
Horatio's garage shooting.

11:41.056 --> 11:43.136
She hasn't shown up yet.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.560
Alexx, that was four hours ago.

11:57.522 --> 12:00.272
Okay, first call came in at 9:15.

12:00.272 --> 12:03.274
Opa-locka body haulers dispatched at 9:45.

12:03.274 --> 12:04.956
There's no record of them dropping it off?

12:04.956 --> 12:06.548
Rest stop's 20 miles from here.

12:06.548 --> 12:08.152
Should take an hour, tops.

12:08.152 --> 12:10.831
I never saw that transport guy before.
Does he work for us?

12:10.831 --> 12:13.215
Crime scenes in the sticks
aren't handled by our guys.

12:13.215 --> 12:16.407
County hires outside haulers, more efficient.

12:17.028 --> 12:17.841
Neck fracture.

12:17.841 --> 12:20.139
Haven't collected trace, so take it easy, okay?

12:20.139 --> 12:22.088
Yes, ma'am. Good luck, boys.

12:22.088 --> 12:24.243
Okay, well, anybody get his name 'cause I didn't.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.204
When's the last time you
asked for a hauler's name?

12:26.204 --> 12:30.804
Oh, lord, please don't tell me we sent
a body away with a complete stranger.

12:30.804 --> 12:35.108
- Alexx, we sent a body away...
- Timmy... I know.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.569
Hey...

13:24.569 --> 13:26.057
Looked for you in firearms.

13:26.057 --> 13:29.550
Yeah, I hit a dead end with the gun.
It was registered to our victim.

13:29.550 --> 13:32.496
Let's say the victim pulled out his
own weapon for self-defense purposes,

13:32.496 --> 13:35.043
and the bad guy took it and shot him with it.

13:35.043 --> 13:37.749
Unfortunately, there's just no way to prove it.

13:37.749 --> 13:40.403
Because we have no prints on the gun, right?

13:40.403 --> 13:41.330
Mm-hmm.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.897
I'm looking at these pictures
because I couldn't get a stock number,

13:43.897 --> 13:46.828
so I had to do a practical.

13:49.967 --> 13:52.932
and where one door closes...

13:53.518 --> 13:55.562
killer drives a Chrysler concorde.

13:55.562 --> 13:57.897
I'll get ahold of DMV. / Nice.

14:01.043 --> 14:04.110
Doug, did you shoot Richard beckham?

14:05.115 --> 14:05.937
Who is that?

14:05.937 --> 14:09.851
A broken tail light from your car
places you at the scene.

14:09.851 --> 14:11.884
Look, whoever the guy was,

14:12.745 --> 14:14.605
he rams my bumper,

14:14.605 --> 14:15.904
next thing I know, he pulls out a gun.

14:15.904 --> 14:18.117
Right, and you shot him with that gun, right?

14:18.117 --> 14:19.672
No. no. No way.

14:19.672 --> 14:21.559
He scared the hell out
of me, waving that thing around.

14:21.559 --> 14:24.498
I got back in my car, and I took off.

14:24.958 --> 14:26.626
- My bumper, man.
- Don't even think about it.

14:26.626 --> 14:28.383
Get back in the car. / Whoa, whoa.

14:28.383 --> 14:30.108
Get back in the car!

14:32.359 --> 14:35.139
He was alive when I drove away.

14:36.180 --> 14:39.305
What do we have here?

14:39.305 --> 14:44.003
Doug, did you know that Richard
beckham was a diamond dealer?

14:44.674 --> 14:46.987
No. / Did you know he was delivering two million

14:46.987 --> 14:49.967
in cut diamonds to Brianna corsini this morning?

14:50.899 --> 14:54.537
No. / But you were with her
earlier this morning, right?

14:54.537 --> 14:56.519
You are her trainer, right?

14:57.540 --> 14:59.366
Yeah. / We got a yes.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.701
Did you ever go by the name of Colton?

15:01.701 --> 15:04.024
No. / So we're back to no.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.983
Look, if, if you don't believe me,

15:06.983 --> 15:08.718
please, ask around.

15:09.757 --> 15:11.764
I think I might just do that.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.964
Okay, Eugene.

15:20.964 --> 15:22.448
This is your chance.

15:22.883 --> 15:24.639
Now take your time.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.623
- They don't look like Colton.
- You're sure?

15:33.623 --> 15:37.996
Unless Colton changed his face,
Colton was...

15:38.521 --> 15:41.118
Okay. Colton's very angry.

15:41.118 --> 15:42.966
Yeah. / Right.

15:44.621 --> 15:47.294
- You're disappointed in me.
- No, this is hard stuff.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.528
Yeah.

15:48.992 --> 15:53.491
Yeah, my dad used to look disappointed.

15:55.615 --> 15:58.745
I'm not stupid. / No. Eugene,

15:58.745 --> 16:01.554
I know that. I know that.

16:02.241 --> 16:04.045
All right?

16:04.045 --> 16:05.875
We're going to get you a ride home.

16:05.875 --> 16:08.143
It's a halfway house, it's not a home.

16:08.143 --> 16:10.253
Okay. It's not a problem.

16:10.253 --> 16:12.410
You ready? / Uh-oh.

16:12.410 --> 16:16.028
- What's the matter?
- My tie, it's messed up.

16:16.028 --> 16:17.268
May I? / I need my mirror.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.403
Eugene.. / My mirror.

16:18.403 --> 16:19.905
It's okay. Come here.

16:19.905 --> 16:21.681
Let me do it. / Yeah.

16:22.118 --> 16:23.816
There you go.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.326
There.

16:25.326 --> 16:27.189
It's good now. / Yeah.

16:27.962 --> 16:30.049
Thank you, H.

16:31.672 --> 16:34.184
You're welcome, Eugene.
Come on.

17:35.073 --> 17:36.997
Hey. / It's good timing.

17:37.381 --> 17:38.697
Talk to me.

17:39.060 --> 17:41.656
Well, I examined the filament of Doug's car

17:41.656 --> 17:43.677
against a normal concorde bulb,

17:43.677 --> 17:45.199
and they were different colors.

17:45.199 --> 17:47.195
So I tried something else.

17:47.195 --> 17:49.843
I heated the filament first
before I broke the bulb,

17:49.843 --> 17:51.215
and when the air rushed in,

17:51.215 --> 17:54.132
the oxidation caused the
filament to change color.

17:59.803 --> 18:02.679
which means the bulb was hot
when it was broken, right?

18:02.679 --> 18:05.199
Which is how Doug
conveniently had the accident.

18:05.199 --> 18:07.510
He backed into Richard's car.

18:11.181 --> 18:12.831
We're talking about a bump-and-run team.

18:12.831 --> 18:14.828
So there's another party involved here.

18:14.828 --> 18:17.722
Okay, we need to take another
look at the crime scene.

18:17.722 --> 18:18.706
Okay.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.324
Yelina just booked Doug.

18:30.746 --> 18:32.178
Okay.

18:32.591 --> 18:34.990
All right, here's the problem
with Doug. He's a sidekick.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.189
We are looking for the shooter.

18:36.189 --> 18:38.213
Eugene has been right all along.

18:38.213 --> 18:40.061
It, it's just that Colton.

18:40.061 --> 18:41.361
isn't a lot to go on.

18:41.361 --> 18:43.121
And that's why we have
to recover that bullet.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.603
I don't know what to do.
I have been through the garage,

18:45.603 --> 18:48.975
top to bottom, twice,
back with a metal detector,

18:48.975 --> 18:51.363
- and I haven't found the bullet.
- Hold on a second.

18:52.431 --> 18:53.648
Huh.

18:53.648 --> 18:55.914
Take a look at this parking space.

18:56.416 --> 18:59.486
- It's empty.
- Empty at the time of the photograph, right?

18:59.486 --> 19:01.582
So it wasn't necessarily empty

19:01.582 --> 19:02.704
when our victim was shot.

19:02.704 --> 19:04.800
These parking spaces are assigned, right?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.760
So if we find the car, we might find the bullet.

19:06.760 --> 19:10.403
We find the bullet, we find the shooter.

19:11.485 --> 19:12.611
This is the spot.

19:12.611 --> 19:15.030
Homicide is talking to the owner of the car,

19:15.030 --> 19:18.242
and he says he was at the
dentist on crime day.

19:18.242 --> 19:20.784
And he didn't notice the guy
bleeding on the concrete?

19:20.784 --> 19:22.843
He said he was very busy.

19:24.855 --> 19:26.884
Does he usually park here?

19:26.884 --> 19:28.335
Well, here's what he said

19:28.335 --> 19:31.806
A reserved space and he always...

19:32.222 --> 19:33.636
parks head out.

19:33.636 --> 19:35.716
So, if the bullet's here, it'll be in the front.

19:43.101 --> 19:44.200
There it is.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.070
Looks like a.45.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.458
Not the victim's gun.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.116
Still has blood on it.

19:59.116 --> 20:01.334
Five lands and grooves
with a right hand twist.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.894
There's only one weapon
I know with generals like that.

20:03.894 --> 20:05.163
Smith & wesson revolver.

20:05.163 --> 20:09.124
So this is our trajectory right here.

20:11.779 --> 20:13.388
Which means...

20:13.840 --> 20:17.573
Richard beckham was killed
somewhere in this area, right?

20:17.622 --> 20:19.027
You rammed my bumper, man.

20:19.027 --> 20:20.859
- Just give me your information.
- Like hell. You give me yours.

20:20.859 --> 20:22.981
Fine. Here.

20:25.126 --> 20:26.934
And the shooter...

20:26.934 --> 20:28.877
worked along this line.

20:28.877 --> 20:30.373
Hey, back off!

20:31.450 --> 20:33.621
And the victim never saw what hit him

20:33.925 --> 20:36.626
because that's the way these teams work.

20:42.946 --> 20:45.893
I'll run the bullet through IBIS. / Okay.

20:46.878 --> 20:48.109
Let's do that.

20:52.189 --> 20:54.266
Timmy said you found the body hauler.

20:54.599 --> 20:57.710
Yeah. Genius was trying to leave
town in the company van.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.008
Did he still have the body?

20:59.008 --> 21:00.509
No, but he had this.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.945
He said that some guy flagged him
down right after he left the rest stop

21:03.945 --> 21:05.779
and said he would pay for the body.

21:05.779 --> 21:07.946
Hauler sold that girl's body?

21:08.466 --> 21:12.010
Well, Eric, if the body's out there,

21:12.010 --> 21:13.548
why are we in here?

21:13.548 --> 21:16.649
Well, my guy at the Fed told me that with new bills

21:16.649 --> 21:20.978
it's very probable that only six sets
of hands have touched them.

21:20.978 --> 21:23.662
So, ninhydrin will find them.

21:29.091 --> 21:32.184
Bureau of engraving is entirely mechanized.

21:40.823 --> 21:44.527
So, that leaves...

21:44.527 --> 21:45.757
the Fed...

21:46.959 --> 21:48.682
the bank teller...

21:48.682 --> 21:51.102
and the little creep who sold the body.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.395
And the bigger creep who paid for it.

21:54.363 --> 21:57.447
Oh, yeah. Run that sucker.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.680
Got one.

22:13.193 --> 22:15.218
All right, looks like our mystery man

22:15.218 --> 22:17.987
had a DUl back in '87.

22:18.459 --> 22:21.369
Thomas kincaid. Age 47.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.360
Look at the address.

22:24.887 --> 22:27.186
That's the same as Jenny's driver's license.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.324
The victim's father.

22:31.933 --> 22:34.163
That's your print on the stack of hundreds.

22:34.163 --> 22:36.460
And we know that you paid off the body hauler,

22:36.460 --> 22:38.082
and you dumped your daughter's corpse.

22:38.082 --> 22:39.394
Jenny...

22:39.394 --> 22:41.121
Jenny, Jenny went to the mall.

22:41.121 --> 22:43.027
We have no idea where she is.

22:43.027 --> 22:45.465
My wife's out looking
for our daughter right now.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.388
Her and her sister.

22:47.388 --> 22:50.331
Mr. Kincaid, you know where Jenny is.

22:50.331 --> 22:52.259
Why don't you just tell us?

22:53.296 --> 22:56.772
All right, well, uh, mind if we look in your car?

22:56.772 --> 22:58.649
Trunk maybe? / I do.

22:58.649 --> 22:59.992
No problem. Your wife's going to get back,

22:59.992 --> 23:01.971
we'll just ask her.

23:01.971 --> 23:03.482
Okay, well, I'll have her call you.

23:03.482 --> 23:06.861
Oh, no, don't bother.
We've already got a warrant and a backhoe.

23:06.861 --> 23:09.179
Uh, what do you think we should
start digging up first?

23:09.179 --> 23:10.403
The pool? / Sure.

23:10.403 --> 23:12.420
Maybe the gardens?

23:12.420 --> 23:16.603
I, uh, I'll take you to her.
To my daughter.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.777
- She's on the property?
- Hmm, Yeah.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.274
Yeah, we found her.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.590
Don't you let her out of your sight.

24:03.590 --> 24:05.399
I'll come get her myself.

24:09.761 --> 24:11.841
I want to know why.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.243
We were talking at the top of the stairs,

24:14.243 --> 24:16.763
and... she fell.

24:16.763 --> 24:18.160
She fell?

24:18.964 --> 24:20.484
What were you talking about?

24:20.484 --> 24:22.337
Uh, it was nothing special.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.662
It, it was an accident.

24:25.662 --> 24:29.821
Most people, when they
have accidents, they call 911.

24:29.821 --> 24:31.854
They don't cover them up.

24:33.810 --> 24:35.690
Get him out of here.

24:40.062 --> 24:41.336
Officer, what's going on here?

24:41.336 --> 24:42.930
Don't worry. Everything's going
to be okay. Come on.

24:42.930 --> 24:44.354
- Thomas?
- Officer, what's the meaning of this?

24:44.354 --> 24:45.826
Why are the police here?

24:47.012 --> 24:47.995
Are you handcuffed?

24:47.995 --> 24:49.869
- It's a misunderstanding, honey.
- Is Jenny okay?

24:49.869 --> 24:52.281
Go with your sister.
Go on. I, I'll be back.

25:06.602 --> 25:08.206
So, what happened to our girl?

25:08.206 --> 25:10.274
Broken neck that we knew about.

25:10.274 --> 25:12.751
But a subdural hematoma that we didn't.

25:12.987 --> 25:15.721
Impact ricocheted the brain
to the front of the skull.

25:15.721 --> 25:17.566
Contra-coup contusion.

25:19.015 --> 25:21.121
Typical in falls.

25:23.243 --> 25:25.813
Hey, Alexx, are you sure
nobody snapped her neck?

25:25.813 --> 25:30.709
Well, if someone had, there'd be
bruising on this part of her throat.

25:30.709 --> 25:32.611
None. See?

25:33.035 --> 25:35.241
Her old man was telling the truth.

25:35.241 --> 25:36.493
Why did he try to hide the body?

25:36.493 --> 25:38.190
I don't know, Timmy.

25:38.526 --> 25:40.520
Why don't you go ask daddy,

25:40.520 --> 25:43.267
while I check for sub-cue bruising?

25:43.759 --> 25:45.052
What's that thing for?

25:45.052 --> 25:47.197
To see what you and I can't.

25:50.422 --> 25:52.526
Jenny found out that...

25:52.850 --> 25:55.097
that I was having an affair.

25:55.483 --> 25:57.785
She was going to tell my wife.

25:58.158 --> 25:59.769
So, that's what you were arguing about.

25:59.769 --> 26:01.496
Jenny got mad.

26:02.357 --> 26:03.605
I couldn't blame her.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.982
How could you do this to mom?

26:04.982 --> 26:08.707
- It's complicated.
- No, it's disgusting.

26:08.707 --> 26:11.310
I grabbed her arm to calm her down.

26:11.310 --> 26:13.061
She said to let go.

26:13.061 --> 26:15.066
- She'd tell her mom.
- She broke free from you?

26:15.066 --> 26:17.857
Yeah. And I tried to grab her again.

26:18.284 --> 26:22.514
And I, I must've been yelling at her.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.142
Must have scared her.

26:26.508 --> 26:28.568
'Cause that's when she fell.

26:28.972 --> 26:29.869
It's disgusting.

26:29.869 --> 26:31.008
Jenny, calm down. / No.

26:31.008 --> 26:31.922
Jenny!

26:37.137 --> 26:39.524
I, I couldn't just let my wife...

26:39.524 --> 26:42.264
I couldn't let my wife know
I was having an affair.

26:42.798 --> 26:44.481
I, I just needed time.

26:44.481 --> 26:48.198
Wouldn't it have been easier to explain to
your wife than to hide your daughter's body?

26:48.198 --> 26:49.958
This wasn't just any affair.

26:51.518 --> 26:54.084
This was with my wife's sister.

26:54.084 --> 26:56.657
You mean the woman consoling your wife?

26:56.657 --> 26:59.698
Yeah. they're sisters.

27:11.202 --> 27:12.674
From Alexx.

27:22.324 --> 27:25.361
This is subcutaneous photos from the M.E.

27:25.361 --> 27:27.111
Bruising at right angle.

27:27.111 --> 27:29.286
Two points of contact.

27:29.584 --> 27:32.249
Jenny didn't fall. You pushed her.

27:32.906 --> 27:35.123
How could you do this? / Stop. Stop!

27:39.898 --> 27:41.617
No.

27:41.617 --> 27:44.927
- It did not happen that way.
- Take a look. The proof is right there.

27:44.927 --> 27:47.472
I think I'll need my lawyer now.

27:51.721 --> 27:54.313
Oh, come on, hit.

27:57.948 --> 27:59.209
Anything?

27:59.209 --> 28:01.636
I've been running this bullet
through IBIS for an hour,

28:01.636 --> 28:03.662
and I don't even have a likely suspect.

28:03.662 --> 28:06.155
So our guy is not a first-timer.

28:06.155 --> 28:07.126
But the gun is.

28:07.126 --> 28:11.512
So maybe he's the type of criminal
that uses a fresh gun for every crime.

28:11.512 --> 28:13.605
So he gets rid of his old ones.

28:14.323 --> 28:15.509
All right.

28:16.619 --> 28:19.070
Checking F.J.D.

28:19.070 --> 28:21.541
For a stolen Smith & wesson.

28:26.193 --> 28:28.122
Lucky for us. It's a pretty rare model.

28:28.122 --> 28:30.796
Let's pick up this Chris...

28:42.492 --> 28:44.899
Let's pick up this Chris hildago fast, okay?

28:44.899 --> 28:46.423
You got it.

28:50.697 --> 28:51.543
Doctor?

28:51.543 --> 28:53.222
- Lieutenant Caine?
- How's he doing?

28:53.222 --> 28:54.725
Well, he's in no shape for questions.

28:54.725 --> 28:56.527
- And what does that mean?
- It means that he's not good.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.101
He was beaten badly,
head traum broken pelvis.

28:58.101 --> 29:00.198
Okay, let me ask you another question.
Is he going to make it?

29:00.198 --> 29:02.764
Well, he's still bleeding because
there's an irreversible D.I.C.

29:02.764 --> 29:03.846
D.I.C... What is that?

29:03.846 --> 29:07.891
Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
That means his blood won't clot.

29:07.891 --> 29:09.176
Look at this, we're not going to win this one.

29:09.176 --> 29:11.884
What are we talking about in
terms of time frame, how long?

29:11.884 --> 29:14.002
It could be minutes, hours.

29:15.177 --> 29:18.520
Okay. Okay.

29:38.135 --> 29:42.474
Hey. / H.

29:42.844 --> 29:44.222
Hey.

29:45.618 --> 29:49.287
Did... we get the bad guy?

29:49.287 --> 29:51.378
No, not yet.

29:51.378 --> 29:53.179
But, Eugene, we will.

29:53.179 --> 29:54.866
We're going to get him.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.413
I want to go with you.

29:58.413 --> 29:59.969
Okay, I understand that.

30:00.426 --> 30:03.849
I need you to rest, okay?

30:03.849 --> 30:06.712
We're partners, right?

30:07.698 --> 30:09.389
Yeah.

30:09.758 --> 30:12.970
Yes, we are partners.

30:12.970 --> 30:15.721
But listen to me.
You know Eugene, sometimes...

30:15.721 --> 30:20.868
sometimes, partners cover for each other.

30:21.786 --> 30:24.706
And I'm covering for you.

30:25.238 --> 30:28.907
Okay.. partner.

30:32.366 --> 30:34.003
Lieutenant Caine?

30:36.272 --> 30:39.705
Okay. Give me a minute.
Eugene, listen to me.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.112
They're going to pull me out of here, okay,

30:41.112 --> 30:43.329
but I'm going to be back in about an hour.

30:43.329 --> 30:47.184
But here's what I want you to do, Eugene.

30:47.439 --> 30:50.746
I want you to hang in there.
I want you to hang on, okay?

30:50.746 --> 30:52.791
O... kay.

30:52.791 --> 30:56.092
Okay... okay, partner.

30:59.527 --> 31:01.966
I'm sorry. / Yeah.

31:02.542 --> 31:03.657
I don't, uh...

31:03.657 --> 31:05.168
I don't think he has any family.

31:05.168 --> 31:06.405
He's indigent,

31:06.405 --> 31:08.249
so that means the county
will dispose of his body.

31:08.249 --> 31:11.021
Ma'am, the man is still alive, okay?

31:11.021 --> 31:12.760
So, thank you for your help

31:12.760 --> 31:14.802
and I'll check back with you in about an hour.

31:15.162 --> 31:17.295
Okay? Thank you.

31:26.834 --> 31:28.222
Hey, Dougie.

31:28.222 --> 31:30.986
So, decided to sic your
partner on Eugene, huh?

31:30.986 --> 31:32.027
- I told you I didn't have a partner.
- Where is your cell phone?

31:32.027 --> 31:34.282
Right here, huh?

31:35.812 --> 31:37.491
This is your cell phone? / Yes, it is.

31:37.491 --> 31:38.761
You decided to call your buddy.

31:38.761 --> 31:39.738
No, I didn't call anyone.

31:39.738 --> 31:41.565
No? Whose number is this?
Whose number is that?

31:41.565 --> 31:42.996
It's my bail bondsman.
Bail bond. No partner.

31:42.996 --> 31:46.788
Okay, let's try calls received.
You see, it occurred to me, Doug...

31:46.788 --> 31:49.077
it occurred to me that once your
partner finished off Eugene,

31:49.077 --> 31:51.366
he would call you. On this phone.

31:51.366 --> 31:54.848
Now, whose number is that?
Let's find out. What do you think?

31:57.008 --> 31:59.267
Hello. / Yeah, Colton.

31:59.267 --> 32:01.636
Hey, Colton, you just made
a big mistake, my friend.

32:01.636 --> 32:04.231
You should have never
laid a hand on Eugene.

32:04.231 --> 32:06.552
Who is this? / Who is this?

32:08.542 --> 32:11.168
You are about to find out.

32:21.911 --> 32:23.756
Hey, I got your page.

32:23.756 --> 32:26.193
You hear that our victim's
dad here dummied up?

32:26.193 --> 32:28.459
Yeah, and lawyered up.

32:28.459 --> 32:30.750
Got me thinking about the struggle.

32:31.179 --> 32:33.860
Thought about my own kids fighting. Whoo.

32:33.860 --> 32:38.917
They scratch, pull hair, kick and bite.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.884
Well, what have you got?

32:43.631 --> 32:45.417
Right now, just a hunch.

32:54.329 --> 32:56.322
Okay, what about now?

32:57.154 --> 32:58.582
Tissue.

32:58.582 --> 33:00.881
And the DNA of whoever she bit.

33:05.672 --> 33:06.955
Results from the tissue?

33:06.955 --> 33:08.162
Yeah.

33:09.419 --> 33:13.128
Alleles indicate a close family relative.
The father?

33:13.128 --> 33:16.598
No. I've got the dad's DNA profile right here.
Look a little closer.

33:18.986 --> 33:20.045
Female?

33:20.045 --> 33:22.829
Did the math, and it's not the mom.

33:23.222 --> 33:27.561
- The aunt?
- Or as dad likes to call her, the uh, mistress.

33:27.951 --> 33:29.071
Excuse me?

33:29.699 --> 33:31.602
Roll up your sleeves.

33:37.396 --> 33:38.962
The other one, too.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.251
- This is none of your concern.
- You're sleeping with my dad.

33:49.251 --> 33:50.763
Either you tell my mom, or I will.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.074
Just shut up!

34:06.914 --> 34:09.002
Thomas promised me he wouldn't tell.

34:09.002 --> 34:11.413
He didn't. DNA did.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.864
Was he even there?

34:14.208 --> 34:17.328
He was downstairs, reading a book.

34:29.204 --> 34:30.795
I lied.

34:33.397 --> 34:35.851
I told him she fell.

34:35.851 --> 34:37.981
That wasn't enough for you to
take away your sister's husband.

34:37.981 --> 34:41.360
You wanted to take away her daughter, too.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.909
She didn't deserve either.

35:15.676 --> 35:20.122
The man's going to spend years behind bars
when all he had to do was tell the truth.

35:30.083 --> 35:32.735
Cover-up gets them every time.

35:45.490 --> 35:47.962
Can we get you a ride home?

35:48.547 --> 35:50.604
I don't have a home.

35:52.448 --> 35:54.527
I'm sorry.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.837
I knew something was wrong.

35:57.837 --> 36:00.637
I just couldn't put my finger on it.

36:01.820 --> 36:04.765
My daughter figured it out.

36:05.554 --> 36:08.274
She was always so smart.

36:23.945 --> 36:26.283
So, you're Chris hildago.

36:26.283 --> 36:29.140
I know, not what you expected.
I get that a lot.

36:29.140 --> 36:32.128
I understand that you
reported a gun missing.

36:32.128 --> 36:34.706
Yeah, it disappeared from work two days ago.

36:34.706 --> 36:37.702
.45 is a rather big gun for a woman.

36:37.702 --> 36:40.863
Yeah, well, not too many women work where I do.

36:40.863 --> 36:42.036
And where do you work?

36:42.036 --> 36:45.425
A pharmaceutical company
in the bad part of liberty city.

36:45.425 --> 36:48.122
It's the cleaning crew
that makes me nervous.

36:48.122 --> 36:50.730
Owner hires work release.
Cheap labor.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.190
Who do you think took your gun?

36:52.190 --> 36:53.589
This one guy.

36:53.589 --> 36:55.702
He's always macking me.

36:55.702 --> 36:57.610
I shine him on.

36:58.326 --> 37:01.791
Wayne... something.

37:01.791 --> 37:04.132
Okay. does Wayne still work there?

37:04.132 --> 37:08.280
Probably look too obvious if he quit
the day after he stole my gun.

37:14.672 --> 37:16.036
Wayne delroy? / Yeah.

37:16.676 --> 37:17.624
Can I help you?

37:17.624 --> 37:20.983
Chris hildago tells me that you
asked her out three times,

37:20.983 --> 37:23.680
and when she turned you down,
her gun disappeared.

37:23.680 --> 37:26.431
Three times? She's not that hot.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.460
Besides, I'm not allowed to have firearms.

37:29.460 --> 37:31.600
- Work release.
- So, you were in the joint?

37:31.600 --> 37:33.441
Did you have a nickname in there?

37:33.441 --> 37:34.976
Jackknife,

37:34.976 --> 37:37.888
- 'cause of how I worked one.
- But not Colton?

37:37.888 --> 37:39.593
You mean like the sneakers?

37:39.593 --> 37:41.846
What do you mean, the sneakers?
What are you talking about?

37:41.846 --> 37:44.817
Well, I don't wear them,
but a lot of guys wear colton sneakers.

37:44.817 --> 37:47.098
Sneakers. who wears them?

37:51.853 --> 37:53.760
Thank you, Wayne.

37:56.668 --> 37:58.152
What's your name, pardner?

37:59.582 --> 38:01.667
Tolson, Pete tolson.

38:02.542 --> 38:04.097
Is your locker, Pete?

38:04.097 --> 38:09.051
Yup. / So, I take it that these...

38:09.051 --> 38:11.594
colton sneakers would be yours, then.

38:11.594 --> 38:12.576
That's my locker.

38:12.576 --> 38:14.809
- You shot Richard beckham, didn't you?
- I didn't shoot anyone.

38:14.809 --> 38:16.433
No?

38:16.908 --> 38:19.593
Okay. Let's see.

38:19.593 --> 38:21.948
Mind if I look in your locker, Pete?

38:21.948 --> 38:24.079
Go ahead. / Okay.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.019
This is interesting.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.445
I bought those off a fence.

38:43.355 --> 38:44.563
Really?

38:44.563 --> 38:45.737
Pete, here's what I think.

38:45.737 --> 38:49.567
I think you're part of a bump-and-run team
that crashed into Richard beckham,

38:49.567 --> 38:51.802
who was a diamond dealer.

38:58.268 --> 39:01.922
An argument between your partner
and Mr. Beckham ensued,

39:01.922 --> 39:04.364
during which you shot Mr. Beckham.

39:04.364 --> 39:06.152
- You rammed my bumper, man.
- Give me your information.

39:06.152 --> 39:07.611
Yeah, like hell. you give me yours.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.123
Fine, here.

39:09.123 --> 39:11.454
Hey, back off. / Hand it over.
- Get your hands off me!

39:14.989 --> 39:17.570
Your partner reached into the car,

39:17.570 --> 39:19.523
grabbed these diamonds
and handed them to you.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.083
That's what I think.

39:26.853 --> 39:27.928
Here you go.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.290
All you've got are a bunch of
diamonds I bought off a fence.

39:33.290 --> 39:34.436
Oh, on the contrary, Pete.

39:34.436 --> 39:39.131
I have... a witness who
saw you do the shooting.

39:39.131 --> 39:41.111
Yeah, like hell. you give me yours.

39:41.111 --> 39:42.726
Fine, here.

39:42.726 --> 39:44.373
- Hey, back off.
- Get your hands off me!

39:44.373 --> 39:47.006
I said hand it over. I said back off.

39:49.406 --> 39:51.311
Come on, let's go, let's go.

39:54.991 --> 39:56.165
That's a nice fairy tale.

39:56.165 --> 39:57.250
These your clothes?

39:57.250 --> 39:59.306
Yup. Laundry day.

39:59.306 --> 40:02.358
Laundry day.
I'm going to take these too.

40:08.159 --> 40:09.690
Yeah..

40:09.690 --> 40:11.246
Yeah, no, that's good.

40:11.246 --> 40:12.322
No, that's good.

40:12.322 --> 40:14.640
Okay, listen, um, I'll be right here.

40:14.640 --> 40:15.949
Yeah, I'll be here.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.486
Hey, um...

40:24.297 --> 40:27.080
Yeah? Yeah, speaking.

40:27.795 --> 40:29.469
Yes, doctor.

40:33.558 --> 40:35.008
I understand.

40:36.590 --> 40:39.208
No. Huh-uh.

40:39.208 --> 40:40.823
Okay.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.663
Okay.

41:05.375 --> 41:07.071
Better be you.

41:20.024 --> 41:21.717
We got a problem. / How so?

41:21.717 --> 41:23.681
Tolson. He beat us to the punch.

41:23.681 --> 41:26.289
He's in there cutting a deal with
the state's attorney right now.

41:26.289 --> 41:27.503
Is that the problem?

41:32.733 --> 41:34.124
Gentlemen.

41:37.413 --> 41:43.205
Pete, I understand that you just rolled
over on your partner for the diamond heist.

41:43.205 --> 41:46.934
Hey, man, I'm not doing less than
20 years for shooting that guy.

41:46.934 --> 41:48.035
We all pay.

41:48.035 --> 41:50.911
Yes, we do, Colton.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.841
Do you know what that is?

41:55.841 --> 42:01.471
That is your shirt with
Eugene walker's blood on it.

42:01.471 --> 42:05.030
And it got there because you beat him to death.

42:05.336 --> 42:10.459
Now, I know you tried to wash it,
but DNA, Pete, is a funny thing,

42:10.459 --> 42:13.231
and it has a tendency to hang around.

42:15.910 --> 42:17.853
I did that guy a favor, man.

42:17.853 --> 42:19.961
That guy was a retard.

42:27.323 --> 42:28.786
You know, Pete,

42:28.786 --> 42:30.653
Eugene had some things to overcome,

42:30.653 --> 42:33.460
I will give you that, but you know what?

42:33.460 --> 42:37.623
You know what, Pete?
At the end of the day, he...

42:37.623 --> 42:41.586
just put you away for life.

42:56.694 --> 42:57.996
Excuse me.

42:58.355 --> 42:59.609
Excuse me.

43:00.232 --> 43:01.716
Hang on a minute, will you?

43:01.716 --> 43:04.438
Um, there's been a change of plans,

43:04.438 --> 43:05.861
and he's...

43:05.861 --> 43:07.880
he's going to have a private burial.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.784
So, I'll take it from here, all right?

43:10.784 --> 43:12.361
Sure, okay. / Thank you.

43:13.070 --> 43:14.173
Thank you.

43:35.525 --> 43:37.316
Eugene...

43:38.706 --> 43:41.568
Eugene, I think your dad
would be proud of you.

43:42.660 --> 43:44.523
I really do.

43:53.085 --> 43:55.159
I know I am.
