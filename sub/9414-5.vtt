WEBVTT

00:07.516 --> 00:11.044
She had an uneasy feeling right
from the very first day.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.045
[Gasps]

00:12.046 --> 00:13.059
Jesse?

00:13.060 --> 00:16.463
I thought, there's something
evil in this house.

00:16.464 --> 00:19.332
It felt like someone was
watching her all the time.

00:19.333 --> 00:22.302
I started to think I was going crazy.

00:22.303 --> 00:25.606
I didn't want to say, I
think you're insane.

00:25.607 --> 00:26.974
Let's go see a Doctor.

00:26.975 --> 00:28.308
You see them?

00:28.309 --> 00:29.710
I didn't want to say that.

00:29.711 --> 00:31.011
[Child screams]

00:31.012 --> 00:32.746
It kept getting more and more intense.

00:32.747 --> 00:34.214
Mari-Lynn?

00:34.215 --> 00:36.082
- [Sobbing]
- This is crazy.

00:36.083 --> 00:38.063
Mommy?

00:39.549 --> 00:41.788
I really wanted out of that house.

00:41.789 --> 00:44.069
[Screaming]

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:06.080 --> 01:09.249
I was married previously to Robyn.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.885
We were married for 25 years.

01:11.886 --> 01:16.173
She was diabetic, so she was very hard
to care for the last couple years.

01:16.174 --> 01:18.959
You know, it was very difficult.

01:18.960 --> 01:24.240
She passed away just after
she turned 50 years old.

01:24.933 --> 01:27.601
But I bounced back pretty quick.

01:27.602 --> 01:31.922
It was maybe a year later I met Lynn.

01:32.941 --> 01:36.402
I honestly didn't think it would evolve

01:36.403 --> 01:38.812
into a relationship the way it did.

01:38.813 --> 01:41.993
Pick anything you like.

01:42.917 --> 01:45.547
She picks out this ring,
you know, and I was like,

01:45.548 --> 01:48.188
well, you want to get married?

01:48.189 --> 01:49.790
[Laughter]

01:49.791 --> 01:52.893
We got married within a
year of meeting each other.

01:52.894 --> 01:56.794
It was a whole new life for me.

01:56.921 --> 01:59.483
I never had kids, and I..

01:59.484 --> 02:02.970
I always wanted to have a little boy.

02:02.971 --> 02:06.640
And now I had this beautiful
woman and this little boy,

02:06.641 --> 02:10.329
and I finally get the family that I wanted.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.750
Things couldn't be better.

02:16.834 --> 02:20.853
Mark was still living in the same
house that he and Robyn shared.

02:20.854 --> 02:23.023
Isn't it beautiful?

02:23.024 --> 02:26.228
It was a beautiful house on a
beautiful piece of property.

02:32.497 --> 02:36.713
To marrying a man who could give
my son and I anything we wanted.

02:36.714 --> 02:40.395
Jesse, let's go in the house.

02:40.396 --> 02:41.675
[Giggles]

02:41.676 --> 02:44.242
I was excited that Jesse was gonna have a

02:44.243 --> 02:47.313
beautiful house to grow
up in in the country.

02:47.314 --> 02:50.314
Ready? Let's go in.

02:55.089 --> 02:56.623
Whoa.

02:56.624 --> 02:59.960
When I went in the house, I was amazed.

02:59.961 --> 03:02.729
Mark owned an antique store.

03:02.730 --> 03:06.800
There's paintings and vases and antiques.

03:06.801 --> 03:10.705
I'd never seen so much beautiful furniture

03:10.706 --> 03:14.074
in one place, but I was very nervous.

03:14.075 --> 03:15.375
Don't touch anything, Jesse.

03:15.376 --> 03:17.964
I was worried Jesse was
going to break something

03:17.965 --> 03:21.381
or damage something that was irreplaceable.

03:21.382 --> 03:25.702
- Welcome to your new home.
- [Giggles]

03:27.621 --> 03:29.489
It was very dark.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.491
The blinds were shut.

03:31.492 --> 03:33.326
There was no life.

03:33.327 --> 03:36.207
It just felt dead.

03:41.635 --> 03:46.495
She was uneasy right
from the very first day.

03:47.650 --> 03:53.550
She was freaked out by all the
Angels that Robyn had collected.

03:55.566 --> 03:59.042
Figurines, pictures, china cabinets

03:59.043 --> 04:02.883
just filled with Angel figurines.

04:04.525 --> 04:08.185
They were all over the place.

04:15.090 --> 04:18.338
Jesse, don't touch, okay?

04:18.339 --> 04:22.370
The house was still all
decorated by Robyn's hand.

04:22.371 --> 04:26.931
After she died, I hadn't changed anything.

04:28.398 --> 04:32.238
Robyn had her own room upstairs.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.937
She had it all decorated up.

04:37.938 --> 04:40.013
You know, I had a bed up there,

04:40.014 --> 04:43.244
and she would go up there,
and she hung out in there.

04:43.245 --> 04:47.745
He asked Jesse and I to stay out of it.

04:49.536 --> 04:51.242
Jesse!

04:51.243 --> 04:53.406
I didn't want people going in there.

04:53.407 --> 04:55.242
It was her room.

04:55.243 --> 04:59.083
Let's go find your room, Jesse.

05:05.086 --> 05:09.923
Robyn, she and I have very different
tastes in how we like to decorate.

05:09.924 --> 05:13.960
And I really, really hated a lot of
the things that she had in there.

05:13.961 --> 05:16.263
At first, I was reluctant.

05:16.264 --> 05:19.199
You know, I didn't really
want to change it all.

05:19.200 --> 05:24.136
But after a while, I was like, we
got to get rid of these things.

05:24.137 --> 05:27.974
He said nothing in the house really
meant anything to him any more.

05:27.975 --> 05:30.010
He's in the business of selling things.

05:30.011 --> 05:31.978
So anything in the house could be sold.

05:31.979 --> 05:33.932
Let's have a garage sale.

05:33.933 --> 05:39.093
I mean, you know, let's
get rid of these Angels.

05:39.253 --> 05:43.489
I was taking down a lot of Angels
and putting them in boxes.

05:43.490 --> 05:48.410
And I just couldn't wait
to get rid of them.

05:58.372 --> 06:01.632
I always felt uncomfortable,

06:01.633 --> 06:04.777
maybe like I shouldn't be there.

06:04.778 --> 06:08.614
At first, it was just a feeling.

06:08.615 --> 06:13.475
Very uncomfortable, like
eyes were just on me.

06:20.427 --> 06:22.729
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.037
It was a very successful garage sale.

06:25.038 --> 06:29.560
I was shocked at how
many people like Angels.

06:29.561 --> 06:32.981
We probably sold about 75.

06:34.203 --> 06:37.894
Jesse and I were waiting
for Mark to come home..

06:37.895 --> 06:39.636
And he was playing.

06:39.637 --> 06:42.457
[Whispering] Jesse.

06:46.687 --> 06:48.667
Jesse.

06:59.867 --> 07:03.347
He was just standing there.

07:05.206 --> 07:08.802
And he looked up at me and said..

07:08.803 --> 07:12.823
Mama, there's a lady in the tree.

07:17.318 --> 07:21.458
There's no lady in the tree, Jesse.

07:23.857 --> 07:25.392
And there's blood.

07:25.393 --> 07:27.127
This came out of the blue.

07:27.128 --> 07:31.798
And I honestly.. At that point, I
wasn't sure what he was talking about.

07:31.799 --> 07:35.270
So I saw that he was disturbed by this.

07:35.271 --> 07:37.016
And I said.. You mean lady..

07:37.017 --> 07:38.303
You go away.

07:38.304 --> 07:41.664
You leave my Jesse alone.

07:44.800 --> 07:49.015
And he just went right back to playing.

07:49.016 --> 07:53.307
But curiosity got the best of me,
so a couple minutes later, I said,

07:53.308 --> 07:55.824
Jesse, is the bad lady gone?

07:55.825 --> 07:59.362
And he looked up and he
looked across the yard,

07:59.363 --> 08:03.563
and he said, now she's in the road.

08:07.568 --> 08:11.001
It frightened me because he was so young.

08:11.002 --> 08:13.882
Because I knew he couldn't
make something like that up.

08:13.883 --> 08:18.263
Come on, Jesse. Let's go to the house.

08:20.947 --> 08:23.246
- You better get going.
- Mm-hmm.

08:23.247 --> 08:25.151
Oh, yeah, okay. Bye. Have a good day.

08:25.152 --> 08:28.392
- Love you.
- Love you.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.280
I was downstairs in the kitchen..

08:35.282 --> 08:37.630
And I heard a cry.

08:37.631 --> 08:39.803
[Baby crying]

08:39.804 --> 08:43.464
So I stopped, and I listened.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.116
I thought maybe I was hearing things.

08:47.117 --> 08:50.450
I just tried to brush it off and..

08:50.451 --> 08:53.368
And go back to work.

08:53.369 --> 08:54.647
[Baby screaming]

08:54.648 --> 08:55.997
[Gasps]

08:55.998 --> 08:57.978
Jesse?

09:04.338 --> 09:06.786
I thought it was odd, because
immediately as a Mother,

09:06.787 --> 09:10.075
I think, oh, my son's crying.
And then it hits me..

09:10.076 --> 09:12.038
He's not even here.

09:12.039 --> 09:14.191
[Baby crying]

09:14.192 --> 09:18.032
Where's this crying coming from?

09:18.667 --> 09:20.532
It was within the house.

09:20.533 --> 09:24.253
It wasn't coming from outside.

09:26.707 --> 09:28.747
I went into every room.

09:28.748 --> 09:32.958
And there was nobody or nothing there.

09:32.959 --> 09:35.539
[Door rattling]

09:35.914 --> 09:38.986
I heard a lot of noise
coming out of Robyn's room,

09:38.987 --> 09:41.125
the room we were never to go into.

09:41.126 --> 09:44.417
[Door rattling, shouting and crying]

09:44.418 --> 09:47.152
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.513
I had a horrible feeling.

09:59.780 --> 10:02.360
[Door rattling]

10:12.181 --> 10:16.410
The blinds were flapping, and
it was very cold in there.

10:16.411 --> 10:21.655
The windows were both opened and there
was so much stuff across the floor.

10:21.656 --> 10:26.336
I could not figure out how that got opened.

10:35.737 --> 10:40.374
I came home, and I thought,
what the heck is going on here?

10:40.375 --> 10:44.235
It looked like someone had been in
there rifling through everything.

10:44.236 --> 10:45.880
Mari-Lynn, why did you come in the room?

10:45.881 --> 10:47.148
Look, it's a mess.

10:47.149 --> 10:50.918
I didn't want rain coming in,
getting on Robyn's stuff.

10:50.919 --> 10:54.039
I was angry about it.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.469
- I just found it like that.
- Well, look at the room.

10:57.470 --> 11:00.073
He clearly didn't believe me.

11:00.074 --> 11:02.877
I thought, well, maybe it's just me.

11:02.878 --> 11:05.880
I started to think there was
something wrong with me.

11:05.881 --> 11:07.815
- Did Jesse.. Did he do this?
- No.

11:07.816 --> 11:10.350
She was saying, no, it wasn't
her and it wasn't Jesse.

11:10.351 --> 11:12.386
- Who else could it be?
- Did you do this?

11:12.387 --> 11:15.927
No, I didn't come in here.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.290
Mark and I were lying in bed..

11:27.291 --> 11:28.998
And all of a sudden I woke up.

11:28.999 --> 11:31.639
[Child laughing]

11:33.608 --> 11:37.148
You could hear children laughing,
playing, and I said to Mark..

11:37.149 --> 11:38.442
Do you hear that?

11:38.443 --> 11:41.545
He just laid his head back, shut
his eyes, and he went, yup.

11:41.546 --> 11:42.746
What is it?

11:42.747 --> 11:45.567
[Children laughing]

11:46.651 --> 11:50.302
We have a swing set right
outside our window.

11:50.303 --> 11:52.656
[Children laughing]

11:52.657 --> 11:57.637
It sounded like they were
right outside playing.

12:04.518 --> 12:07.338
[Children laughing]

12:10.274 --> 12:15.479
I don't know why I kept looking
for these things I was hearing.

12:15.480 --> 12:21.380
But when you hear a child, your
instinct is to go look for it.

12:26.557 --> 12:29.377
[Children laughing]

12:30.995 --> 12:33.215
[Creaking]

12:42.172 --> 12:44.992
There was nothing.

12:46.775 --> 12:52.115
I don't know what I was
thinking I was gonna find.

12:52.650 --> 12:54.870
[Creaking]

12:58.455 --> 13:02.058
Then Hansel threw down one handful
after the other out of his pocket.

13:02.059 --> 13:04.594
Well, it was hard for
me to put Jesse to bed.

13:04.595 --> 13:08.865
His room is right across from Robyn's room.

13:08.866 --> 13:10.400
Okay, time for bed.

13:10.401 --> 13:13.202
And so, for the longest time,
I wouldn't put him to bed.

13:13.203 --> 13:16.203
I kept him with me.

13:17.141 --> 13:19.486
And Mark's like, absolutely not.

13:19.487 --> 13:22.779
You have to put him to bed.

13:22.780 --> 13:26.260
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:31.889 --> 13:36.823
We were sitting in the living
room watching television.

13:36.824 --> 13:38.911
[Child screaming]

13:38.912 --> 13:43.700
Jesse started screaming
almost like he had been hurt.

13:43.701 --> 13:46.159
It was that kind of a cry.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.136
He had only been up there
for a few minutes.

13:48.137 --> 13:50.071
And I'm like, what's he screaming about?

13:50.072 --> 13:52.843
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

13:52.844 --> 13:54.478
[Gasping] Mommy.

13:54.479 --> 13:56.546
Jesse, are you okay?

13:56.547 --> 13:59.483
He's just screaming, pointing
at the closet, Mama, Mama.

13:59.484 --> 14:03.204
There's a lady in the closet.

14:17.371 --> 14:19.435
Oh, Jesse, there's nothing there.

14:19.436 --> 14:23.206
You just had a bad nightmare, okay?

14:23.207 --> 14:26.507
Mommy, Mommy, Mama, Mama!

14:27.177 --> 14:31.214
He's terrified. He's crying.
His face is beet-red.

14:31.215 --> 14:34.237
I didn't know what to do.

14:34.238 --> 14:37.988
I couldn't see what he was seeing.

14:37.989 --> 14:41.857
You're gonna be okay, all right?

14:41.858 --> 14:44.728
- Mari-Lynn..
- Mark told me to put him back to bed.

14:44.729 --> 14:46.172
He just wanted attention.

14:46.173 --> 14:48.197
No, he's really scared.
I have to stay with him.

14:48.198 --> 14:51.267
I was like, kids see things at night.

14:51.268 --> 14:54.571
I mean, I always thought there
was ghosts in my closet too.

14:54.572 --> 14:57.540
I can see why Mark felt that way.

14:57.541 --> 15:00.421
But I knew better.

15:02.445 --> 15:06.634
So I laid with him for a while
till he calmed down. And..

15:06.635 --> 15:12.535
I was so mad at Mark that he
made me put him back to bed.

15:13.591 --> 15:17.527
I felt like I wasn't getting any support.

15:17.528 --> 15:22.291
It's really hard, as a Mom, to
watch your child be terrified..

15:22.292 --> 15:27.752
And terrified of something
you don't know what it is.

15:32.710 --> 15:36.038
It was Sunday morning, and
Mark was at the store.

15:36.039 --> 15:40.839
I had decided to catch
up on some housework.

15:42.653 --> 15:44.821
[Objects crashing and shattering]

15:44.822 --> 15:48.157
It was something big and heavy,
and you could hear glass break.

15:48.158 --> 15:50.259
- Jesse, are you okay, hon?
- Yeah.

15:50.260 --> 15:54.100
And so I went into the kitchen.

15:54.498 --> 15:59.838
And the water was on, just
full blast, both faucets.

16:00.004 --> 16:04.507
Jesse couldn't have done that.
He wasn't tall enough.

16:04.508 --> 16:07.544
And as I was shutting that off..

16:07.545 --> 16:09.360
[Door rattling and banging]

16:09.361 --> 16:14.283
There was banging at the garage
door in the laundry room.

16:14.284 --> 16:16.839
You could see the door move.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.090
Like something was trying
to bust the door in.

16:20.091 --> 16:23.899
So I just mustered up all
the courage I could..

16:23.900 --> 16:27.920
And I opened the door really fast.

16:30.167 --> 16:32.535
There was nothing happening in the garage.

16:32.536 --> 16:34.771
No breeze.

16:34.772 --> 16:38.012
There was nothing there.

16:39.529 --> 16:42.649
[Garage doors rattling]

16:54.559 --> 16:57.561
There was something just
beating on the door.

16:57.562 --> 17:00.598
Beating on the door, and
the door was moving.

17:00.599 --> 17:03.567
I could see the door move.

17:03.568 --> 17:06.369
And all of a sudden, the
lights were flashing.

17:06.371 --> 17:08.472
Jesse! Jesse, where are you?

17:08.473 --> 17:10.007
Mama, Mommy!

17:10.008 --> 17:12.443
- Jesse?
- Mommy!

17:12.444 --> 17:15.979
And at that point, I could
see my son is really afraid.

17:15.980 --> 17:21.740
So I picked up the phone, and
I called Mark at the shop.

17:22.688 --> 17:24.087
Mark, you have to come home.

17:24.088 --> 17:25.556
She's in a panic.

17:25.557 --> 17:28.626
She's crying, please come home.

17:28.627 --> 17:30.894
I just thought, what is going on here?

17:30.895 --> 17:33.246
I don't know.
You have to come home, please.

17:33.247 --> 17:35.999
I just remember thinking, this is crazy.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.868
Come home. Please come home.

17:37.869 --> 17:40.809
Come home. [Sobbing]

17:42.874 --> 17:47.254
I felt like I was just frozen in fear.

17:48.112 --> 17:53.275
I didn't understand why Mark
wouldn't come and get us.

17:53.276 --> 17:55.285
[Sobbing]

17:55.286 --> 18:01.186
I was starting to wonder if she
wasn't having a nervous breakdown.

18:03.362 --> 18:06.182
[Children laughing]

18:08.032 --> 18:11.869
I felt like I was insane at that point.

18:11.870 --> 18:15.639
What if I was crazy, and they
locked me up or something?

18:15.640 --> 18:18.160
[Loud banging]

18:18.377 --> 18:21.912
I don't want to ever lose my son.

18:21.913 --> 18:24.433
[Loud banging]

18:29.287 --> 18:31.687
Oh, Sweetie.

18:34.025 --> 18:37.128
I was a little surprised when she
started talking about being afraid

18:37.129 --> 18:39.930
or not being comfortable
in the house any more.

18:39.931 --> 18:41.599
Because that wasn't at all like her.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.500
We're gonna sort this thing out.

18:46.271 --> 18:50.080
My sister was studying
psychology in college. And..

18:50.081 --> 18:54.111
She brought some books over and
we also got on the Internet.

18:54.112 --> 18:57.882
I would show her what the symptoms were
exactly, and we went through them.

18:57.883 --> 19:02.119
People with Schizophrenia
that have hallucinations

19:02.120 --> 19:05.598
do not experience them the
same way that Mari-Lynn was.

19:05.599 --> 19:08.826
They weren't speaking to her
or telling her to do things.

19:08.827 --> 19:11.407
It's not you.

19:11.930 --> 19:14.371
My sister's the only one who,

19:14.372 --> 19:17.535
I could trust I felt, at that point.

19:17.536 --> 19:18.869
I'll go have a look around.

19:18.870 --> 19:20.805
So I asked her to look around.

19:20.806 --> 19:23.006
Okay, I'll be back in a minute.

19:23.007 --> 19:25.698
It was a very lovely house.

19:25.699 --> 19:28.579
There was a lot of very
beautiful things there.

19:28.580 --> 19:31.134
My eyes were just wandering everywhere..

19:31.135 --> 19:33.655
Room by room.

19:40.058 --> 19:45.629
As I was approaching the door, I started
feeling a little bit different.

19:45.630 --> 19:48.870
My heart started racing.

19:50.196 --> 19:53.856
And I just felt very anxious.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.518
I call it that fight or
flight type of feeling

20:07.519 --> 20:12.389
where you just kind of want to turn
around and run right out of there.

20:12.390 --> 20:17.728
Mari-Lynn was down there waiting for me,
and I told her what I was experiencing.

20:17.729 --> 20:21.899
She said that was the same room
where Robyn was when she was sick.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.536
- Why don't we go get some lunch?
- Oh, no, I can't.

20:24.537 --> 20:26.770
I have to pick Jesse up in an hour.

20:26.771 --> 20:30.305
When she told me she felt
weird around that area,

20:30.306 --> 20:33.878
I thought, well, it must be Robyn.

20:33.879 --> 20:36.446
She's still in there, or she's still here.

20:36.447 --> 20:40.117
She doesn't want to leave her house.

20:40.118 --> 20:44.748
I did tell Mark, and again,
he just brushed me off.

20:44.749 --> 20:47.654
I kept saying, no, it can't be.

20:47.655 --> 20:50.895
It can't be Robyn. I didn't believe that.

20:50.896 --> 20:56.796
Robyn would never do that.
You know, she's not that kind of person.

21:00.405 --> 21:06.305
A little while later, I started working
with Mark at the antique store.

21:08.246 --> 21:11.048
Anytime I wasn't in the
house, it was great.

21:11.049 --> 21:13.183
My son was at school. He was safe.

21:13.184 --> 21:16.820
And I got to be with Mark most of the day.

21:16.821 --> 21:18.311
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

21:18.312 --> 21:19.339
Yeah, good.

21:19.340 --> 21:22.880
So I felt a lot safer too.

21:26.941 --> 21:28.369
It's a beautiful store.

21:28.370 --> 21:32.502
It's in an old historic building
built in the late 1800s.

21:32.503 --> 21:35.305
It's very big.. It's 10,000 square feet,

21:35.306 --> 21:39.986
two levels, and it was
absolutely beautiful.

21:42.447 --> 21:45.816
Okay, next I'd like to put the
clock in front of the store.

21:45.817 --> 21:48.552
Peter started out as a customer.

21:48.553 --> 21:51.221
I bought every single Beatles
album that was in the shop.

21:51.222 --> 21:55.722
And she saw that, and we started talking.

21:55.927 --> 21:57.534
And I said, I wish I could hire you,

21:57.535 --> 21:59.817
but you're not in my budget
right now, and he said..

21:59.818 --> 22:04.134
I'll work for free.
This would be fun for me.

22:04.135 --> 22:09.506
Lynn and I were working on one
of the windows in the shop.

22:09.507 --> 22:15.407
There was this picture frame that
was leaning against the counter.

22:16.715 --> 22:19.055
[Clattering]

22:20.519 --> 22:24.079
Just kind of lifted up and feel over.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.167
You saw that happen?

22:25.168 --> 22:27.678
This picture just picked up.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.106
And kind of flew across the room and..

22:30.107 --> 22:33.167
And landed face down.

22:38.536 --> 22:41.132
Peter and I just looked at each other.

22:41.133 --> 22:43.953
Did you see that?

22:44.066 --> 22:47.083
I just was thinking,
what the hell was that?

22:47.084 --> 22:50.624
What the hell just happened?

22:54.619 --> 22:56.807
Peter and I were closing the store.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.724
And just as we were leaving..

22:58.725 --> 23:01.605
[Footsteps creaking]

23:01.793 --> 23:05.633
We heard some footsteps upstairs.

23:06.951 --> 23:10.100
- Did you hear that?
- We just stopped, and we listened.

23:10.101 --> 23:12.589
We have accidentally shut lights off on

23:12.590 --> 23:14.905
customers before, not
realizing they're in there.

23:14.906 --> 23:16.304
Someone must be upstairs.

23:16.305 --> 23:20.544
But I knew we had gotten all
the customers out of the shop.

23:20.545 --> 23:24.805
We checked the monitors on the camera.

23:25.349 --> 23:27.278
There was nobody up there.

23:27.279 --> 23:29.452
[Footsteps thudding]

23:29.453 --> 23:34.493
But there was still very
clear footsteps walking.

23:34.893 --> 23:39.993
I'm gonna step up there
and have a little peek.

23:45.503 --> 23:47.938
My heart was beating pretty fast.

23:47.939 --> 23:52.019
I just didn't know what to expect.

23:59.513 --> 24:00.951
[Pounding]

24:00.952 --> 24:03.712
Something pounded.

24:04.022 --> 24:05.988
It made me jump out of my skin.

24:05.989 --> 24:08.491
[Faint wailing]

24:08.492 --> 24:11.282
I'd never seen him react like that.

24:11.283 --> 24:15.866
I didn't care what was back there.
I was gonna get out of there.

24:15.867 --> 24:20.967
I was frightened, thinking
it was out of control.

24:24.488 --> 24:26.364
[Pounding]

24:26.365 --> 24:28.212
It wasn't going away.

24:28.213 --> 24:31.273
It was getting worse.

24:48.850 --> 24:52.220
Mark went in and looked around the shop.

24:52.221 --> 24:54.989
And there was nobody there.

24:54.990 --> 24:56.724
It was scary for me.

24:56.725 --> 24:59.026
I didn't want to say, I
think you're insane.

24:59.027 --> 25:02.267
Let's go see a Doctor.

25:03.132 --> 25:07.368
I didn't want to say that, you know?

25:07.369 --> 25:10.538
I felt very trapped.
I didn't know where to go.

25:10.539 --> 25:12.173
I couldn't go home.

25:12.174 --> 25:14.642
I couldn't go to work.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.810
This was happening everywhere I was going,

25:16.811 --> 25:21.551
and there was no place to get away from it.

25:26.155 --> 25:28.156
It was starting to scare me.

25:28.157 --> 25:30.324
I didn't want to lose them.

25:30.325 --> 25:34.805
It kind of seemed like, you
know, they're gonna leave.

25:34.806 --> 25:39.366
Jesse, come on. We're going in the house.

25:42.814 --> 25:46.774
I really wanted out of that house.

25:46.775 --> 25:49.710
I begged Mark to move.

25:49.711 --> 25:52.880
I want to be able to protect my family.

25:52.881 --> 25:55.807
But I didn't have the
resources to, you know,

25:55.808 --> 25:59.287
just pack up and go somewhere else.

25:59.288 --> 26:01.789
I should have left.

26:01.790 --> 26:05.630
I should have got out of there.

26:22.183 --> 26:24.845
Oh. Morning, soldier.

26:24.846 --> 26:27.940
I remember getting up, you know..

26:27.941 --> 26:30.821
And I looked down.

26:31.286 --> 26:35.666
I got these three scratches on my hand.

26:35.691 --> 26:38.326
I'm thinking, how did that happen?

26:38.327 --> 26:42.887
I looked like someone just went like this.

26:44.700 --> 26:48.060
And about the same time..

26:50.405 --> 26:54.125
I saw three marks on my side.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.335
She's got these scratches on her side,

26:59.336 --> 27:03.618
looked like someone had scratched us both.

27:03.619 --> 27:08.256
And what scared me is I
didn't feel it happen.

27:08.257 --> 27:11.437
It didn't wake us up.

27:11.526 --> 27:16.926
I did not have a rational
explanation for any of it.

27:22.437 --> 27:28.337
That evening, I decided to go sit down
and watch television with my husband.

27:32.614 --> 27:35.949
I kept telling myself, just watch TV.

27:35.950 --> 27:39.790
Just deal with it. Get over it.

27:43.958 --> 27:48.098
I felt like someone was watching me.

27:53.669 --> 27:56.970
She's like, I can't sit in the living room.

27:56.971 --> 27:58.205
You know, I'm like, why?

27:58.206 --> 28:00.675
They're looking at me.

28:00.676 --> 28:05.613
She's like, well, there's these
people looking down on me.

28:05.614 --> 28:07.782
You see them?

28:07.783 --> 28:12.523
- Who's looking at you?
- Can you see them?

28:16.456 --> 28:19.636
I didn't see anything.

28:25.066 --> 28:26.454
I totally panicked.

28:26.455 --> 28:29.995
Jesse, where are you? Jesse?

28:31.506 --> 28:35.008
My heart was racing. I couldn't breathe.

28:35.009 --> 28:36.989
Jesse?

28:37.412 --> 28:41.672
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

28:42.016 --> 28:43.996
Jesse?

28:44.686 --> 28:46.666
Jesse?

28:55.458 --> 28:57.030
[Gasps]

28:57.031 --> 28:58.222
Mommy?

28:58.223 --> 29:01.268
I ran to Jesse to make sure he was okay.

29:01.269 --> 29:04.869
I didn't want to scare him.

29:07.642 --> 29:12.262
I realized at that moment it wasn't Robyn.

29:13.715 --> 29:17.626
She was wearing black
Victorian mourning clothes.

29:17.627 --> 29:21.655
The little boy had on a
little suit from that era.

29:21.656 --> 29:26.636
Robyn wouldn't be dressed
in Victorian clothing.

29:26.919 --> 29:30.819
So I knew it couldn't be Robyn.

29:34.191 --> 29:39.807
The night Jesse got burnt, that was
the scariest thing I ever seen.

29:39.808 --> 29:42.777
Jesse, dinner's ready.

29:42.778 --> 29:46.438
I'm still freaked out by it.

29:49.651 --> 29:52.319
Jesse, Mark, and I were all in the kitchen.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.455
And I had all the food out on the counter.

29:54.456 --> 29:58.893
And we were all standing
there fixing our plates.

29:58.894 --> 30:00.561
Jesse reached up.

30:00.562 --> 30:03.431
And just as he touches
this piece of chicken..

30:03.432 --> 30:04.854
[Screaming]

30:04.855 --> 30:07.640
He starts screaming.

30:07.641 --> 30:09.570
He's like, ah!

30:09.571 --> 30:13.073
He was just shaking like
he's being electrocuted.

30:13.074 --> 30:15.042
I'm standing there next
to him, and I'm like,

30:15.043 --> 30:17.277
what's the matter? What's the matter?

30:17.278 --> 30:19.339
He's crying. He's panicking.

30:19.340 --> 30:20.848
My side, my side.

30:20.849 --> 30:23.909
[Screaming and crying]

30:24.553 --> 30:29.713
So we lifted up his shirt
to see what was wrong.

30:31.693 --> 30:34.261
And this red mark appeared.

30:34.262 --> 30:39.500
It just started to grow as we were looking
at it, you know, bigger and bigger.

30:39.501 --> 30:41.869
There's nothing hot around him.

30:41.870 --> 30:42.888
Couldn't explain it.

30:42.889 --> 30:43.739
[Crying]

30:43.740 --> 30:45.819
It's okay, it's okay. What happened?

30:45.820 --> 30:48.943
It was the scariest thing I've ever seen.

30:48.944 --> 30:53.413
I should have taken him to the
Doctor, but how do you explain that?

30:53.414 --> 30:56.350
I had no explanation.

30:56.351 --> 30:59.419
I couldn't go in and lie.

30:59.420 --> 31:00.420
Mark saw it all.

31:00.421 --> 31:03.357
- What happened?
- I don't know!

31:03.358 --> 31:05.092
It had a major effect on him.

31:05.093 --> 31:10.433
He finally believed us, but
it had to come to that.

31:11.165 --> 31:16.003
For the next few weeks, it was
like I was just not there.

31:16.004 --> 31:19.205
Jesse's getting hurt. We're getting hurt.

31:19.206 --> 31:22.326
What's gonna be next?

31:34.445 --> 31:37.558
We bunkered down in the
bedroom, Jesse and I did.

31:37.559 --> 31:41.294
We did everything in the bedroom.

31:41.295 --> 31:43.553
It made it worse that it wasn't Robyn,

31:43.554 --> 31:49.254
because if it was Robyn, there
would be a reason for it.

31:51.406 --> 31:53.912
I got this perfect family.

31:53.913 --> 31:57.076
But now she's afraid to come out of the..

31:57.077 --> 31:59.477
The bedroom.

32:02.647 --> 32:07.927
You know, she's scared to
come out of the bedroom.

32:09.558 --> 32:14.598
I thought, there's something
evil in this house.

32:29.407 --> 32:31.920
Mark, I'm going to bed.

32:31.921 --> 32:33.944
Good night.

32:33.945 --> 32:39.585
I was feeling a sense of
pressure building in the house.

32:49.761 --> 32:52.881
They were watching me.

32:58.069 --> 33:01.786
She felt like someone was
watching her all the time.

33:01.787 --> 33:07.687
Even though I couldn't see it or
hear it or feel it or anything.

33:08.412 --> 33:12.552
I didn't know what to do about it.

33:24.829 --> 33:30.301
I look over, and I see this woman
go down into the basement.

33:30.302 --> 33:34.322
And so I went walking over there..

33:34.451 --> 33:37.631
And the door was shut.

33:40.779 --> 33:43.747
So I was thinking, a woman in a dress

33:43.748 --> 33:46.981
just walked right through this door.

33:46.982 --> 33:50.162
What is going on here?

33:50.588 --> 33:52.868
Mari-Lynn?

33:54.725 --> 33:58.205
Mark, I'm trying to sleep.

34:00.135 --> 34:02.264
[Screams]

34:02.265 --> 34:05.260
Sometimes when they'd appear,
the woman had a baby.

34:05.261 --> 34:07.370
[Screams]

34:07.371 --> 34:09.472
Mari-Lynn?

34:09.473 --> 34:11.753
Mari-Lynn?

34:12.629 --> 34:14.909
Mari-Lynn?

34:16.815 --> 34:18.975
[Weeping]

34:20.351 --> 34:24.587
I was starting to see the stuff
just like Mari-Lynn now.

34:24.588 --> 34:28.364
So I was totally believing
her from that point on.

34:28.364 --> 34:31.454
I knew she wasn't crazy.

34:31.455 --> 34:37.030
And I was terrified because I didn't
know what it was, what to do..

34:37.031 --> 34:40.690
And how to live in my house.

34:41.739 --> 34:44.821
I decided I needed to call someone in for

34:44.822 --> 34:49.141
help to figure out who this woman was.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.800
And if I was in danger.

34:56.855 --> 35:02.222
I made some phone calls and
found two local historians.

35:02.223 --> 35:04.364
We love unusual stories.

35:04.365 --> 35:06.634
What we like to do is find out what in

35:06.635 --> 35:11.315
history may have created
this unusual event.

35:13.037 --> 35:16.665
When we first got to the store,
we were introduced to Mari-Lynn,

35:16.666 --> 35:19.343
and she seemed like a very sweet woman.

35:19.344 --> 35:22.074
She was friendly, she was
smiling, very courteous,

35:22.075 --> 35:25.382
even though, I will say, that she
did have a slightly haunted look,

35:25.383 --> 35:27.817
if that's an appropriate
way to describe it.

35:27.818 --> 35:30.104
I was afraid they wouldn't believe me or

35:30.105 --> 35:34.324
would laugh at me, think I was crazy.

35:34.325 --> 35:37.767
I did think she could have
been a very troubled woman.

35:37.768 --> 35:41.865
You always have to consider that as
a possibility in a case like this.

35:41.866 --> 35:44.034
They were very kind, and
they listened to me,

35:44.035 --> 35:47.251
and they said that they'd
look into the past

35:47.252 --> 35:51.752
of what happened in the area I lived in.

35:52.198 --> 35:54.467
We know research. We're all about research,

35:54.468 --> 35:58.181
all about the history that may create
the haunting, not just the haunting.

35:58.182 --> 36:01.004
We will look at land records,
death certificates,

36:01.005 --> 36:03.439
birth certificates, census records.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.649
We do a lot of that, and in this case, we

36:06.650 --> 36:10.324
certainly did hours and hours of research.

36:10.325 --> 36:15.485
I was shocked when I learned
what they found out.

36:28.813 --> 36:33.683
The antique shop used to be the..
"Porter A. Wright Hardware Store".

36:33.684 --> 36:36.820
It was the center of the
town for the time period.

36:36.821 --> 36:40.390
Because it supplied
manufacturing and farmers.

36:40.391 --> 36:42.168
- And gossip.
- And gossip.

36:42.169 --> 36:45.841
They didn't have Facebook then,
so it was a source of gossip.

36:45.842 --> 36:48.143
We were looking at land
records, and we saw that

36:48.144 --> 36:52.160
the property where Mari
and her husband resided..

36:52.161 --> 36:55.772
Had been a farm since the early 1870s.

36:55.773 --> 36:59.135
A young girl by the name of
Theresa Styson lived at the farm.

36:59.136 --> 37:03.713
She was living with her
Uncle Philip and his wife.

37:03.714 --> 37:07.386
Theresa, time to come inside
the house, sweetheart.

37:07.387 --> 37:09.692
They had a young orphan
boy who they cared for.

37:09.693 --> 37:11.413
His name was Nate.

37:11.414 --> 37:13.514
Theresa?

37:14.593 --> 37:18.853
And it made a very interesting family.

37:26.837 --> 37:28.505
[Moaning and grunting]

37:28.506 --> 37:32.646
Months later, Theresa became pregnant.

37:33.144 --> 37:35.871
Well, during the Victorian
era, that was unthinkable

37:35.872 --> 37:38.464
that a single young woman
would become pregnant.

37:38.465 --> 37:40.745
[Screaming]

37:40.786 --> 37:43.575
So Philip had to send her..
He had to send her..

37:43.576 --> 37:45.464
To a Sanatorium far away.

37:45.465 --> 37:46.494
[Screams]

37:46.495 --> 37:49.968
Theresa's pregnancy was a tough one.

37:49.969 --> 37:51.994
And her birth was even more difficult.

37:51.995 --> 37:54.155
[Screams]

37:56.200 --> 38:01.480
She gave birth to an infant,
a young boy who died.

38:09.316 --> 38:15.216
No one in town knew.
The only one who knew was Porter A. Wright.

38:17.129 --> 38:19.618
When Theresa was sent
away to the sanitarium,

38:19.619 --> 38:22.881
the owner of the hardware
store was used as a liaison

38:22.882 --> 38:26.817
for communications between
her and her Uncle Philip.

38:26.818 --> 38:29.678
And how he did that was
rather clandestinely.

38:29.679 --> 38:33.685
He would send letters via
Porter A. Wright's store.

38:33.686 --> 38:37.346
And send her them anonymously.

38:39.143 --> 38:44.183
It wasn't long after that,
she became very ill.

38:46.484 --> 38:48.685
She knew she was near death.

38:48.686 --> 38:52.662
And it was at that point that she
told the people at the Sanatorium,

38:52.663 --> 38:57.883
that her Uncle Philip was
the Father of her child.

39:18.946 --> 39:22.906
Philip Styson was placed on trial.

39:23.050 --> 39:27.887
And during testimony, it was little Nate,
the orphan boy who lived with them,

39:27.888 --> 39:32.392
who gave key testimony,
very damning testimony.

39:32.393 --> 39:36.367
Philip Styson was found guilty of incest.

39:36.368 --> 39:38.468
Theresa.

39:38.748 --> 39:43.703
But the Judge dismissed it, saying
that the testimony was hearsay.

39:43.704 --> 39:47.039
And the trial was dismissed.

39:47.040 --> 39:51.900
When Theresa died, she
was just 19 years old.

40:01.255 --> 40:05.155
Theresa Styson was really wronged.

40:05.225 --> 40:07.376
She died..

40:07.377 --> 40:11.578
With people thinking she was
having an affair with her Uncle..

40:11.579 --> 40:14.967
When I really believe she was
being molested by her Uncle.

40:14.968 --> 40:19.839
And I don't think that she could
rest until her story was told.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.741
It was like peeling back the layers,

40:21.742 --> 40:26.212
and every time, you peeled another layer
back, something new would happen.

40:26.213 --> 40:28.795
They lived on Philip Styson's farm.

40:28.796 --> 40:34.521
Porter A. Wright's hardware store
is the Holly Antique Shop.

40:34.522 --> 40:38.891
A woman in Victorian
clothing holding an infant.

40:38.892 --> 40:42.432
I was seeing her, her baby.

40:42.530 --> 40:46.254
Mari-Lynn and Theresa Styson
were living the same lives

40:46.255 --> 40:49.735
only maybe 100 years apart.

40:50.571 --> 40:55.251
All these connections
were just unbelievable.

40:55.376 --> 40:57.610
They were still there.

40:57.611 --> 41:01.180
Everything just sort of
clicked right into place.

41:01.181 --> 41:03.346
She knew that she was where
she was supposed to be.

41:03.347 --> 41:05.918
She was supposed to be working
in the antique store.

41:05.919 --> 41:08.455
And she was supposed to be living
at the house where she is.

41:08.456 --> 41:12.091
She had been validated. She wasn't crazy.

41:12.092 --> 41:17.992
I mean, there really was a connection
between her and this Victorian family.

41:24.071 --> 41:27.173
I don't see them any more.

41:27.174 --> 41:29.087
I don't see the..

41:29.088 --> 41:33.528
The woman and the two children any more.

41:34.248 --> 41:35.515
Whoa, slow down.

41:35.516 --> 41:38.918
It was a really terrifying
experience for me.

41:38.919 --> 41:43.299
But in the end, I'm really happy and..

41:43.906 --> 41:47.806
Almost honored that she chose me.

41:48.161 --> 41:51.476
To tell her story through.

41:51.477 --> 41:55.046
She's a huge part of me and
a huge part of my life.

41:55.047 --> 42:00.071
Looking back, you know, I
should have done more.

42:00.072 --> 42:02.716
I should have been more supportive.

42:02.717 --> 42:04.988
I should have believed you know..

42:04.989 --> 42:10.562
I should have believed Jesse instead of
just, every kid's afraid of the dark.

42:10.563 --> 42:14.325
And I treated Mari-Lynn the same way.

42:14.326 --> 42:16.994
I regret that, I really do.
