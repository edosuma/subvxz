I will now steal
your land

and name my sports teams

01:08.302 --> 01:09.701
Joke's on you, white man.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.638

Hi, Mom.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.216
Welcome to our new home.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.484
Cleveland!

01:25.486 --> 01:27.352
Oh, Lord, you're
wasting away.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.687
Are you feeding him?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.823
Not enough. Look at me.

01:30.825 --> 01:31.723
Hello, Cookie.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.692
Well, you've
been eating!

01:34.260 --> 01:35.794
We missed you at the wedding.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.563
Oh, you mean the wedding
with my son

01:37.565 --> 01:40.099
who wasn't good enough for you
25 years ago,

01:40.101 --> 01:40.999
but now you'll take him

01:41.001 --> 01:43.602
since you've been left
with two misbehaving kids?

01:43.604 --> 01:44.503
Yes. That wedding.

01:44.505 --> 01:48.207
And for your information,
my kids do behave themselves.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.007
Ah, (bleep)!

01:49.009 --> 01:50.943
We lit this bag
of dog (bleep) on fire

01:50.945 --> 01:52.511
right on the bears' porch.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.012
Then the bear comes
out and stomps on it!

01:54.014 --> 01:58.383
And he's like, "Oh, I got
dog (bleep) on my (bleep) foot!"

01:58.385 --> 01:59.751
(laughing)

01:59.753 --> 02:01.320
(bleep) bear.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.222
Who the (bleep)
is this?

02:03.224 --> 02:06.225
This is my mother.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.559
I meant no disrespect.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.796
Let me get you a <i>Jets</i> magazine
and some sweet tea.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.097
Oh, thank you,
young man.

02:12.099 --> 02:16.201
But first, I have someone
else I'd like you to meet.

02:16.203 --> 02:16.735
Dad?!

02:16.737 --> 02:18.937
Ow! My neck!
My neck and my back!

02:18.939 --> 02:20.572
Hey, chunky.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.573
Sir.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.975
Donna, you remember
my father,

02:22.977 --> 02:26.278
who left my mother for
a Waffle House waitress.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.045
Twice.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.380
So, you two are
back together?

02:28.382 --> 02:31.617
- Looks that way.
- Why you got to ask
so many questions?

02:33.486 --> 02:35.854
(funk music plays)

02:37.357 --> 02:39.424
Ah, girl,
Thanksgiving is whack.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.793
Every moment I have
to be away from you,

02:41.795 --> 02:44.329
my heart is
like, "Damn!"

02:44.331 --> 02:47.232
(sighing)

02:47.234 --> 02:48.267
You know what?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.468
Hell with our families.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.336
We should have
our own Thanksgiving.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.939
A romantic Thanksgiving.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.340
Just the two of us.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.575
For real, yo?

02:56.577 --> 02:57.676
That's tight.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.746
We's Romeo and Julietin'

03:00.748 --> 03:02.080
I loves you, Ro-ham.

03:02.082 --> 03:05.784
I loves you more than
unicorns love pixie dust.

(dance music plays)

03:12.058 --> 03:14.393
(sniffing)

03:15.895 --> 03:19.264
You got any
Fruit Stripe gum?

03:21.801 --> 03:23.569
(snips)
Ow!

03:23.571 --> 03:24.870
Watch where you
walking, pudgy!

(growls ferociously)

03:26.674 --> 03:27.739
(whimpers)

03:27.741 --> 03:29.641
Um, can I help you
find something?

03:29.643 --> 03:32.878
Nope. I'm just looking for a
glass without a spot on it.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.379
DONNA:
<i>How embarrassing!</i>

03:34.381 --> 03:37.950
<i>I knew I should have paid</i>
<i>a few cents more for Cascade.</i>

03:42.822 --> 03:44.856
Check out baby Cleveland
in the bathtub.

03:44.858 --> 03:48.327
Look at his little,
bitty, tiny cashew.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.595
(both laugh)

03:49.597 --> 03:50.729
I can't see it.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.065
Let me get my
reading binoculars.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.566
(both laughing)

03:54.568 --> 03:55.667
I like this kid.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.835
You know,
I've been thinking.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.971
Maybe I should
shoot out another kid.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.139
Try to get
this one right.

04:01.708 --> 04:02.975
I've had similar thoughts.

04:02.977 --> 04:05.477
And you know, I have not
gone through the change.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.512
You gone through the change
on the outside.

04:07.514 --> 04:10.315
You know, I think
it's wonderful

04:10.317 --> 04:12.150
that the whole
family will be here

04:12.152 --> 04:13.518
for Thanksgiving
supper tomorrow.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.754
Mom, did you
not get my text?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.090
I'm spending Thanksgiving
with Federline.

04:18.092 --> 04:20.225
You most certainly
are not.

04:20.227 --> 04:20.993
Do you have any idea

04:20.995 --> 04:23.028
how much work I am putting
into this dinner?

04:23.030 --> 04:25.397
Judging from those store-bought
pies in the kitchen,

04:25.399 --> 04:26.331
I'd say not enough.

04:26.333 --> 04:29.134
Are you gonna let your crazy
mother talk to me like that?!

04:29.136 --> 04:31.370
(laughs nervously)
That's my mama.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.371
(laughs nervously)

04:32.373 --> 04:35.440
Are you gonna let your big-ass
wife talk to me like that?!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.309
(laughs nervously)
That's my wife.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.310
(laughs nervously)

04:38.312 --> 04:40.178
While you guys work that out,

04:40.180 --> 04:41.246
I'm-a get going.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.814
Roberta, your mother
just wants you...

04:42.816 --> 04:43.882
You are not my father.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.818
New family's really
warming up to you, tubby.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.453
That's it!

04:48.455 --> 04:50.022
You want to dance,
little lady?

04:50.024 --> 04:51.790
Fight, fight,
fight, fight.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.924
Bye, Mom!

04:52.926 --> 04:54.660
You are not
going anywhere!

04:54.662 --> 04:56.161
Let go of my coat!

04:56.163 --> 04:57.996
Your coat?! I paid
for this coat!

04:57.998 --> 05:01.733
RALLO (whistles):
Hey! Cleveland's dad!

05:01.735 --> 05:03.835
CLEVELAND JR:
Dad!

05:06.773 --> 05:08.173
(glass shatters, growling)

05:08.175 --> 05:11.043
ROBERTA: Let go of my coat!
DONNA:
I paid for this coat!

05:11.045 --> 05:12.244
Dad!
Fight, fight, fight...

05:12.246 --> 05:13.545
Let go
of my coat.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.347
WOMAN:
Well, what
in tarnation

05:15.349 --> 05:17.015
is going on up in here?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.950
ALL:
Auntie Momma!

05:18.952 --> 05:20.452
Damn skippy!

05:20.454 --> 05:22.888
Ooh-wee.
Up jump the devil.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.889
Don't squeeze too tight,

05:23.891 --> 05:27.092
or else somebody's gonna
have to call the fart police.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.527
Those fillin' station nachos

05:28.529 --> 05:31.396
are not agreeing
with your Auntie Momma!

05:31.398 --> 05:32.698
(farts loudly)

05:32.700 --> 05:35.000
I'm outrageous!

05:35.002 --> 05:36.468
(all laughing)

05:36.470 --> 05:37.969
Now, stop all this scrappin',

05:37.971 --> 05:40.939
dippin' and dappin',
don't know what's happenin'.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.342
Now, who's this little one?

05:43.344 --> 05:44.776
Donna,
don't tell me you went

05:44.778 --> 05:47.612
and got yourself knocked up
by Anthony Anderson!

05:47.614 --> 05:48.714
(laughs)

05:48.716 --> 05:50.182
You nasty girl.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.116
Hi, strange lady.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.185
My name is
Cleveland Brown Jr.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.554
And I'm Lavar Brown.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.521
(smooches)

05:56.523 --> 05:58.156
But you can call
me "Freight Train."

05:58.158 --> 06:00.992
Ooh! Well,
choo-choo to you!

06:00.994 --> 06:02.461
Hire me a couple Chinese,

06:02.463 --> 06:04.596
'cause we building
a train track right here!

06:04.598 --> 06:07.632
Auntie Momma, you should have
told me you were coming!

06:07.634 --> 06:11.203
Girl, you know Auntie Momma
can't be tied down!

06:11.205 --> 06:13.572
Unless this one's
doing the tying.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.006
Ooh, ooh!

06:15.008 --> 06:16.541
I'm outrageous!

06:16.543 --> 06:17.876
Hey, Auntie Momma.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.978
Cleveland Brown,

06:19.980 --> 06:21.580
as I live and breathe.

06:21.582 --> 06:25.050
Look at you, all grown up
and unconventionally sexy.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.920
Mustache all puttin'
Wilt Chamberlain's to shame.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.055
Honey, I should know.

06:30.057 --> 06:35.093
I was number
8,433 and 11,760.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.595
(farts loudly)

06:36.597 --> 06:39.030
Ooh, I'm outrageous!

06:39.032 --> 06:41.199
Auntie Momma,
we need to talk.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.502
Mmm-hmm. You know
we will, girlfriend.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.338
I want to hear all about the
young mens up in your life!

06:46.340 --> 06:49.107
But right now, Auntie Momma's
off to the powder room

06:49.109 --> 06:51.710
to see what all these
farts are about.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.711
(chuckles)

06:52.713 --> 06:55.147
Maybe this Thanksgiving
won't be so bad, after all.

06:55.149 --> 06:58.116
I'm going to clean up
this broken glass.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.818
Sorry I tossed him
the knife,

06:59.820 --> 07:02.654
but I wanted him
to kill you.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.260
(giggles)

07:08.262 --> 07:10.896
I can see Auntie
Momma's penis.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.064
Auntie Momma's penis?!

07:18.204 --> 07:20.505
(sizzling)

07:21.574 --> 07:22.908
Let's play a game.

07:22.910 --> 07:26.578
Everybody say something
weird about themselves.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.746
I'll start.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.248
I don't have nails
on my small toes.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.216
Your turn, Auntie Momma!

07:31.218 --> 07:34.152
I don't understand why
a no-good team like the Lions

07:34.154 --> 07:35.720
always gets to play
on Thanksgiving.

07:35.722 --> 07:39.991
But I'd still let 'em pile
up on me in the locker room!

07:39.993 --> 07:41.860
I love a good sack!

07:41.862 --> 07:43.228
Auntie Momma!

07:43.230 --> 07:45.697
I'm outrageous.
(chuckles)

07:45.699 --> 07:48.633
(Loretta, Lavar
and Auntie Momma laughing)

07:48.635 --> 07:51.336
See that, Cookie? A lady
who loves football.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.205
That's a real woman.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.540
No offense.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.043
That's an ugly apron.

07:58.045 --> 08:01.580
Whoops. Sometimes
they jump on you.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.015
What's wrong with you, sourpuss?

08:04.017 --> 08:07.085
You look lower
than Clint Eastwood's testicles.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.220
(flushing)

08:08.222 --> 08:09.721
(creaks and pops)

08:09.723 --> 08:11.223
(groans)

08:11.225 --> 08:12.424
We had a pretty good run.

08:12.426 --> 08:15.293
Had Angie Dickinson,
didn't we, boys?

08:15.295 --> 08:17.662
(cocking)

08:17.664 --> 08:20.699
(screaming)

08:20.701 --> 08:21.867
(shot fires)

08:21.869 --> 08:25.270
She won't let me spend
Thanksgiving with Federline!

08:25.272 --> 08:26.972
Girl wants to be
with her boyfriend.

08:26.974 --> 08:31.243
Pumpkin, why you trying to keep
those two lovebirds apart?

08:31.245 --> 08:33.044
Thanksgiving is about family.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.679
Roberta should be with us.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.115
Now, Sweet Potato
Puddin' Plum Pie,

08:37.117 --> 08:40.018
I remember another
15-year-old girl

08:40.020 --> 08:41.853
with more boobs
than brains

08:41.855 --> 08:43.722
who thought nobody
understood her.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.291
Do you know
who I'm talking about?

08:46.293 --> 08:48.260
(sighs)

08:48.262 --> 08:49.027
Me.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.730
And what did I
tell you back then?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.999
You told me that I
should fly like a bird,

08:54.001 --> 08:56.401
because you can't keep
your heart in a cage.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.802
And then you farted.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.038
And then you said
you were outrageous.

09:00.040 --> 09:00.939
That's right.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.574
And now,
when I look at Roberta,

09:02.576 --> 09:04.042
do you know what I see?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.244
A younger, stupider you.

09:06.246 --> 09:11.683
Donna, let
this caged bird fly, too.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.720
I want you home
before curfew.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.721
Thanks, Mom.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.124
I love you,
Auntie Momma.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.726
(Roberta and Donna laughing)

09:22.228 --> 09:26.064
(sighs) That woman can
convince me of anything.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.198
I'll say.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.168
Donna, I need to talk to
you about Auntie Momma.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.270
Cleveland,
I know, I know.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.005
She can be
a little outrageous.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.073
I think
even she knows that.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.642
But my whole life,
she's been the one person

09:37.644 --> 09:38.710
I could always count on.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.212
I don't know what I'd do
without my Auntie Momma,

09:41.214 --> 09:45.283
or if my image of her
was changed in any way.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.352
Now, what did you
want to say?

09:47.354 --> 09:48.987
(sighs)

09:48.989 --> 09:50.922
She's a handsome woman.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.291
Uh, and not like
men are handsome.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.027
Like a woman is handsome.

09:56.829 --> 09:57.829
(whistle blows)

09:57.831 --> 10:00.131
Okay, Turkey Day
football game!

10:00.133 --> 10:01.466
The count's
five Mississippi.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.436
I've chalked the end zones
with Parmesan cheese.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.371
You get one blitz
per set of downs.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.373
There's no rollover blitzes
unless...

10:08.375 --> 10:10.275
Hey!
You talk too much, C-cup.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.409
Tubbs against Browns.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.746
Donna, you got Rallo
and the fine Auntie Momma.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.982
You got your work
cut out for you.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.316
I'm kind of a ball hog.

10:18.318 --> 10:21.720
And I'm also
a hog hog. Mmm.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.355
Well, I don't know
about all that,

10:23.357 --> 10:25.357
but you can
gargle my (bleep).

10:25.359 --> 10:26.691
You outrageous!

10:26.693 --> 10:30.862
Looks like the outrageous
is contagious!

10:31.931 --> 10:35.700
Okay, we'll kick off.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.404
(marching band plays)

10:39.406 --> 10:42.340
(chuckles) Train left
the station and you...

10:42.342 --> 10:43.808
(groans)

10:44.844 --> 10:46.678
(grunts)

10:48.080 --> 10:49.180
Uh-uh!

10:49.182 --> 10:51.650
(grunts)

10:52.685 --> 10:54.352
(dings)

10:56.989 --> 10:59.557
Damn! Where'd you learn
to play like that?

10:59.559 --> 11:02.127
This ain't my first time
on a football field.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.230
Ask Earl Campbell what we
did on the 50-yard line

11:05.232 --> 11:07.699
at the Astrodome
back in '79.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.167
Why don't you show me?

11:09.169 --> 11:12.804
'Cause Donna used all her
Crisco for the pancakes.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.540
There's, uh, Head and Shoulders
in the crapper.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.009
I like the way you think.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.411
Okay, you guys, kick off!

11:19.413 --> 11:22.414
Game's over.
I'm about to pull my groin.

11:26.452 --> 11:27.852
(hisses)

11:27.854 --> 11:28.453
Hmm.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.389
That's one bald pussy.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.491
I'm worried
about your mother.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.326
I'm worried about
my father.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.830
I'm worried about leaving
my soda can unattended,

11:38.832 --> 11:40.932
because a bee
could easily fly in there.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.067
And then I
would take a sip,

11:42.069 --> 11:44.469
and that bee could sting me
inside my throat.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.737
And then people
would ask,

11:45.739 --> 11:47.072
"What's wrong,
Cleveland Brown Jr.?"

11:47.074 --> 11:48.873
And I wouldn't
be able to tell them,

11:48.875 --> 11:50.975
because my throat
would be all closed up.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.211
Write it in your
worry journal.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.416
(rustling)

11:58.418 --> 12:00.118
What was that?

12:01.554 --> 12:04.389
Oh, damn.
It's homelesses.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.924
Oh, my God!

12:08.160 --> 12:09.928
They stole the Cutlass!

12:09.930 --> 12:12.430
They done stripped
me of my whip!

12:12.432 --> 12:13.465
Whip strip!

12:13.467 --> 12:14.933
Whoo-whoo!

12:14.935 --> 12:16.134
(sighs)

12:16.136 --> 12:17.335
Mmm, this Freight Train

12:17.337 --> 12:20.271
can't wait to hook up
with that caboose.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.073
All aboard.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.274
(farts)

12:23.276 --> 12:24.442
Ooh, I got a feeling sex

12:24.444 --> 12:27.145
is going to be
all sloppy with you.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.048
My reputation precedes me.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.516
(chuckling)

12:31.518 --> 12:33.551
CLEVELAND:
<i>O</i> h <i>, what do I do?</i>

12:33.553 --> 12:35.186
<i>What do I do?!</i>

12:35.188 --> 12:37.355
Do the right
thing, Cleveland.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.389
Daryl Hall?

12:38.391 --> 12:39.591
What are you doing here?

12:39.593 --> 12:41.593
I'm here to weigh in
on your situation.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.694
You really thinking about

12:42.696 --> 12:45.163
letting your father walk
into a wiener factory?

12:45.165 --> 12:47.532
I can't go for
that-- no can do.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.933
Who are you?

12:48.935 --> 12:49.567
Seriously,

12:49.569 --> 12:51.970
you got angel Daryl Hall
on your left shoulder,

12:51.972 --> 12:54.405
and you can't
figure out who I am?

12:54.407 --> 12:55.507
John Oates?

12:55.509 --> 12:56.574
Actual size.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.876
Screw you, Hall.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.910
Your dad's a jerk.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.212
Don't tell him.
Let him wrangle that dangle.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.580
Well, maybe if you
warn your father,

13:02.582 --> 13:04.082
he'll finally
appreciate you.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.985
I still say,
let him tickle that pickle.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.254
♪ Whoa-oh, here she comes

13:09.256 --> 13:12.991
♪ Watch out, boy,
she'll chew you up ♪

13:12.993 --> 13:15.426
♪ Whoa-oh, here she comes

13:15.428 --> 13:18.062
♪ She's a man... ♪

13:18.064 --> 13:20.365
(sighs)

13:20.367 --> 13:22.233
Oh, Dad, come here.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.535
Go away, fool!

13:23.537 --> 13:24.636
It's important.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.472
You can't do this, because...

13:27.474 --> 13:29.274
Dad, you came here with Mom.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.342
Show the woman a little respect.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.477
Your mama ain't a woman.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.245
You're more of a
woman than she is.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.347
Your boobs are bigger,
your ass is rounder,

13:36.349 --> 13:38.516
and your mustache
ain't as thick.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.484
That is a woman!

13:39.486 --> 13:41.619
Now, if you'll
excuse me, Princess,

13:41.621 --> 13:45.123
I'm going to go destroy
your kids' bathroom.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.058
You know what?
I take it back.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.128
You and Auntie Momma
have a great time together.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.431
I'm sure you'll learn
a lot about each other.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.200
(laughs)
I'm outrageous.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.202
(grunts)

13:57.204 --> 13:59.003
Uh-oh.

14:04.743 --> 14:08.680
So, should we wait for
Freight Train and Auntie Momma?

14:08.682 --> 14:09.581
(chuckles)

14:09.583 --> 14:12.150
I don't think we'll have
to wait too long.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.484
Let's just sit back and enjoy

14:13.486 --> 14:16.221
the sounds
of a Freight Train wreck.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.522
(chuckles)

14:17.524 --> 14:18.790
That is cold, old man--

14:18.792 --> 14:22.827
letting your own pops
fall blindly into a manhole.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.363
What? How did you know?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.564
Man, I'm five.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.932
Sitting on laps is my job.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.535
I know what's supposed
to be there and what's not.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.471
I can't say as I blame you
for not telling him.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.839
It will be pretty funny.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.274
Can you imagine?

14:36.276 --> 14:37.742
"Oh, I can't wait
to reach down

14:37.744 --> 14:39.577
"and fiddle with
something nice.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.545
"Oh, no, what's this?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.747
"This is a terrible
turn of events.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.617
I'm going to go
punch Cleveland."

14:45.619 --> 14:46.584
Uh-oh.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.785
Oh, it'll be worth it.

14:47.787 --> 14:48.820
(chuckles)

14:48.822 --> 14:52.257
♪ Crying game.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.929
What a fine-looking meal.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.464
I am starving.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.799
I just worked up a
man-sized appetite.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.768
I hope you all
weren't waiting for me.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.737
I was just upstairs
laying down.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.772
(whispering):
With your face
in the pillow.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.008
(retches)
Cleveland, are you okay?

15:10.010 --> 15:13.077
He'd be okay if you
didn't undercook the turkey.

15:13.079 --> 15:13.912
Undercooked?

15:13.914 --> 15:16.681
This turkey looks perfect.

15:17.683 --> 15:18.549
(smooching)

15:18.551 --> 15:21.452
Mmm! Smack myself
in the face with it.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.553
(retching)

15:22.555 --> 15:24.622
Do you want me
to get the bucket?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.391
Mmm! I'm gonna
reach in there

15:26.393 --> 15:28.459
and get me some of
that good stuff.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.629
Look at there, put
my hand up in there.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.631
My whole arm!

15:35.434 --> 15:36.501
Mm, mmm!

15:36.503 --> 15:38.403
Now, that's a mouthful.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.673
(retching)

15:41.675 --> 15:43.341
Looks like I lost
my damn watch.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.410
I don't think it's
in the turkey.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.111
Gobble, gobble.
(laughs)

15:47.113 --> 15:51.149
(retching)

15:57.189 --> 16:00.525
Happy Thanksgiving,
everyone.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.795
Hey, there's your car!
Oh, it's on!

16:03.797 --> 16:06.497
Those homelesses about
to become toothlesses!

16:06.499 --> 16:08.166
They might already
be toothlesses.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.668
I realized that as
I was saying it.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.739
Hey, it's Roberta
and the Friedman boy.

16:14.741 --> 16:18.676
Hey, come help us do
Thanksgiving missionary style.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.278
It's nice to see
the young people

16:20.280 --> 16:22.814
doing the public service
instead of the drugs.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.282
Like I always say,

16:24.284 --> 16:27.185
"Helping others
is the real crystal meth."

16:27.187 --> 16:29.220
Actually, we're not here
to volunteer.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.789
There's one of them fools
who jacked my whip.

16:31.791 --> 16:32.857
Who, Filthy Nick?

16:32.859 --> 16:36.661
Hey, Filthy Nick,
did you steal this kid's car?

16:36.663 --> 16:37.829
Did I steal your car?

16:37.831 --> 16:42.200
Or have you had your
keys all along?

16:42.202 --> 16:43.434
Damn!

16:43.436 --> 16:44.635
Pay it forward.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.070
You look lost, son.

16:46.072 --> 16:46.771
I do?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.306
I may not look
like much to you,

16:48.308 --> 16:50.641
but I've peed a lot
of pants in my day,

16:50.643 --> 16:52.510
and I've learned
a thing or two.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.513
First, family is the
most important thing

16:55.515 --> 16:56.647
you could ever have.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.750
Second, if you try
to wash your pants

16:58.752 --> 17:03.721
in the McDonald's bathroom,
they will call the cops.

17:10.596 --> 17:11.662
(sniffles)

17:11.664 --> 17:13.564
Yo, Ro? Smelly was right.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.733
We should be
with our families.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.101
A'ight.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.436
Filthy Nick!

17:18.438 --> 17:19.837
Send us home!

17:19.839 --> 17:21.305
(whooshing)

17:21.307 --> 17:22.440
(zapping)

17:22.442 --> 17:24.609
I don't understand
why you can do that,

17:24.611 --> 17:26.844
but we still have to
live on spare change.

17:26.846 --> 17:31.115
We're not supposed
to profit from my powers.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.653
All right, this
is killing me.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.055
What's up with you?

17:37.057 --> 17:38.322
I'm outrageous.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.125
No, this is outrageous.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.661
(deep voice):
What do you want?

17:43.663 --> 17:46.431
First, I'll tell you
what I don't want.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.834
I don't want to hold
on to this anymore.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.702
You got me. I'm a man.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.337
You happy? But you
can't tell Donna.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.839
It would break
her sweet little heart.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.240
But why would you...?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.976
Look, Donna's parents
weren't always around.

17:58.978 --> 18:02.713
And I wanted to give her
a strong female role model.

18:02.715 --> 18:07.418
So, when she was about six,
Uncle Kevin became Auntie Momma.

18:07.420 --> 18:11.289
36 years and nine,
ten wigs later, here we are.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.759
But how did you and my dad--
you know-- without him noticing?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.227
Or did he notice?

18:16.229 --> 18:17.128
Let's just say,

18:17.130 --> 18:19.297
when you've been doing this
as long as I have,

18:19.299 --> 18:21.599
you become an expert
at hiding the candy.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.868
Uh, do you have, like,
a little hammock for it,

18:23.870 --> 18:25.536
or is it rigged with
fishing line, or how...?

18:25.538 --> 18:28.673
Look, you got nothing to worry
about with me and your dad.

18:28.675 --> 18:33.077
Now that I know my Donna's in
good hands, I'll be moving on.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.513
You're a good man,
Cleveland Brown.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.682
And you're a
man, too, Kevin.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.584
I'm outrageous.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.786
Oh, Mama,
I'm so sorry

18:41.788 --> 18:44.856
I wanted to spend Thanksgiving
with Federline.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.290
It was awful!

18:46.292 --> 18:47.925
Just as Auntie
Momma planned.

18:47.927 --> 18:51.362
Auntie Momma, is there
anything you can't do?

18:51.364 --> 18:53.564
I can't do it
with the lights on!
What?

18:53.566 --> 18:57.502
W-W-Well, we're glad
to have you home, Roberta.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.903
Happy Thanksgiving.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.438
And now that
my work is done,

19:00.440 --> 19:03.508
I better leave before
I turn into a blumpkin.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.475
You're leaving?

19:04.477 --> 19:07.245
Yeah, Peabo Bryson is
performing in Hampton,

19:07.247 --> 19:09.380
and he likes me naked
in his tour bus

19:09.382 --> 19:11.249
when he gets
off stage.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.583
Wow, Auntie Momma.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.785
You know singers
from yesteryear.

19:14.787 --> 19:19.790
Donna, it fills my heart
to see you so happy.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.896
Got room for me in
that trunk of yours?

19:24.898 --> 19:26.297
Oh, Lavar.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.466
What we shared
on that bathroom floor

19:28.468 --> 19:30.735
and on Cleveland's pillow
was beautiful.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.471
But Auntie Momma's not
a one-man woman,

19:33.473 --> 19:35.339
or a one-town woman.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.607
Yep. Bye-bye.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.242
All right, y'all.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.911
I'm outta here!

19:39.913 --> 19:42.813
In three... two... one...

19:42.815 --> 19:43.814
(farting)

19:43.816 --> 19:49.854
I'm outrageous!

19:49.856 --> 19:53.858
That little lady just farted off
with a piece of my heart.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.359
I'm going after her.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.695
Hey, dummy, get me
a skateboard and a burrito.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.463
Before you go
chasing her down,

19:59.465 --> 20:02.600
I got to tell you
something, Dad.

20:04.736 --> 20:07.505
(speaking inaudibly)

20:20.419 --> 20:22.587
...said her real name's Kevin.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.321
(retches)

20:23.323 --> 20:25.890
Been hiding the candy
for 36 years.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.492
(retching)

20:28.494 --> 20:29.860
You...

20:29.862 --> 20:31.929
had sex...

20:31.931 --> 20:33.364
with a man.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.031
(retching)

20:34.033 --> 20:37.368
You have to promise
not to say anything to Donna.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.002
Yeah, uh...

20:38.004 --> 20:40.338
I'm going to be playing
this down in general.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.672
Now, why don't you
go in there

20:41.674 --> 20:43.341
and say something nice
to my mom?

20:43.343 --> 20:45.509
She's had a hard day
watching you

20:45.511 --> 20:48.346
play grab-ass
with a tranny.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.981
Hey, Cookie.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.882
Hey, Freight Train.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.018
Hair looks real.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.754
Why, thank you.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.523
Hey, look, Grandpa
Freight Train.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.492
Auntie Momma
dropped your watch.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.861
CLEVELAND:
<i>Put that down!</i>
