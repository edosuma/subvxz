00:06.000 --> 00:06.906
[kissing sounds]

00:15.148 --> 00:16.349
Cheeky line?

00:18.000 --> 00:19.285
Oh, um, well I don't know if
we should, it's a Sunday night.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.920
Oh fuck it! Let's go wild.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.291
I'll get us a cup of tea.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.501
[sniffs]

00:38.805 --> 00:40.340
There we are.

00:41.007 --> 00:41.875
Rooibos okay?

00:42.142 --> 00:45.345
Probably shouldn't have
caffeine this late at night.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.284
Wow!

00:51.684 --> 00:52.786
Okay.

00:54.053 --> 00:55.455
In for a penny.

00:56.523 --> 00:57.457
[snorts]

01:00.000 --> 01:02.295
# I'm like a candle burning
End to end #

01:02.929 --> 01:04.697
[pounding]

01:06.000 --> 01:06.933
[both moaning]

01:07.434 --> 01:09.602
-[Dallas] Your lips are
amazing. -[Lauren] Oh thank
you.

01:09.669 --> 01:11.938
[Dallas] I was just thinking
before, you are so familiar.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.206
Familiar? Thank you.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.941
I think we should
dig deeper.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.509
How? I'm pretty sure this
is as deep as I can get.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.610
I can go deeper.

01:18.000 --> 01:18.611
Are you talking
about your penis?

01:18.678 --> 01:20.346
I want to be
so deep with you.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.648
Do you mean in me
or with me?

01:21.714 --> 01:23.483
I know how to
finish the song.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.051
Oh hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on...

01:25.118 --> 01:29.322
[singing] We were lovers,
in a past life...

01:30.056 --> 01:32.125
[both sigh]

01:33.493 --> 01:35.228
[dog barks]

01:37.130 --> 01:39.532
[toaster clicks]

01:40.166 --> 01:41.067
[Jake] Howdy.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.937
Hey ah, what's
wrong with Angus?

01:44.003 --> 01:45.271
She looks a bit flighty.

01:45.338 --> 01:47.006
Why are you here?
It's half six.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.709
I've got that site
meeting remember.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.978
Oh, and the girls,
they need breakfast.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.446
-Great.
-And showers.

01:54.000 --> 01:54.447
Fantastic.

01:54.514 --> 01:57.250
Loz, you always forget
to turn the oven off.

01:57.317 --> 01:58.785
-No I don't.
-Look.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.354
Oh, Jake did you
unplug the toaster?

02:01.421 --> 02:04.591
It is a fire hazard, not to
mention a waste of electricity.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.259
Are you okay?

02:06.326 --> 02:08.862
Yes I'm fine.
I wanted some toast.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.965
Yeah, 'cause you look
really ropey.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.666
Thank you.

02:14.601 --> 02:15.568
[chicken clucks]

02:15.635 --> 02:16.836
So I'm pretty certain
they're going to move me

02:18.000 --> 02:18.605
to wing attack
for semi-finals

02:18.671 --> 02:20.840
because I'm really
practicing my pivot,

02:20.907 --> 02:22.909
my hips now are so flexible
I reckon they could

02:24.000 --> 02:25.011
just like twist the lid off
a jar of tomato sauce...

02:25.078 --> 02:25.879
Lauren!

02:25.945 --> 02:27.680
Yeah? Tomato sauce.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.015
What's that?
Is that a green juice?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.084
I can't have
caffeine today.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.118
A-ha.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.687
Lovely, you did cocaine
last night didn't you?

02:34.754 --> 02:35.722
Off a penis.

02:36.000 --> 02:36.589
[Alex exclaims]

02:36.789 --> 02:38.558
I'm sorry what?
Are you having a breakdown?

02:38.625 --> 02:39.726
Um, I might be.

02:39.792 --> 02:40.560
Have you slept?

02:40.627 --> 02:41.895
About an hour.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.831
But relax,
I was snorting cocaine

02:44.898 --> 02:46.499
on toilet seats before
you were even born.

02:46.566 --> 02:47.667
Hmm, don't think
you were actually.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.668
No, I wasn't.

02:48.735 --> 02:49.802
Whose dick was this anyway?

02:51.271 --> 02:52.171
Dallas's.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.239
Oh well that's it then.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.408
-He's off the list.
-What, he ticks all the boxes.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.676
Nah, and he's ticked
them once too often.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.645
Hot, not needy
and no strings.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.080
I hate to break it to you but
it's called the three shag
rule.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.181
He's going to start
getting feelings.

03:02.248 --> 03:03.316
Oh come on,

03:03.383 --> 03:05.285
the only feelings he's
getting are in his ding-dong.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.120
Don't you ding-dong me.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.522
Once you have liaised with
a gentleman three times,

03:09.589 --> 03:10.857
they start asking
where this is going.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.258
Sorry, are we in
Sex And The City?

03:12.325 --> 03:13.693
It's a thing, ask anyone.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.994
Well why didn't
you tell me before?

03:15.061 --> 03:16.763
Because Dallas is the first guy
you've shtuped three times
so...

03:18.000 --> 03:18.364
Stop making stuff up.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.667
-Three shag rule!
-No such thing.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.835
[man] It's true.
It's a real thing.

03:24.000 --> 03:24.737
[woman] Yeah totally.
Three shag rule.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.375
He's a model,
turned musician, you know,

03:30.000 --> 03:30.710
just think about
that for a second.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.478
Well even models
have feelings, Lauren.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.347
There are no strings.
I would know.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.317
-[woman] Oh Lauren.
-Oh thanks.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.851
What's this?

03:42.000 --> 03:42.221
"Dallas's delicious hampers".

03:42.288 --> 03:45.525
"This should help you recover.
Dallas. Kiss, kiss, kiss".

03:46.292 --> 03:47.894
Literally the definition
of strings attached.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.696
That's not a string,
it's twine.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.734
[Ange] Oh Lauren, can I...

03:55.401 --> 03:56.502
Oh!

03:56.803 --> 03:58.271
[Ange] Someone's popular.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.373
[Ange] From someone special?

04:00.440 --> 04:03.910
Oh no, just a,
a casual friend.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.646
Right well, I just assumed
you wouldn't want to bring

04:06.713 --> 04:09.482
one of your casual friends
to the dance tomorrow night.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.117
Dance tomorrow?

04:12.000 --> 04:12.885
Really?

04:13.553 --> 04:15.788
The 'Dancing with the Bar'
charity event?

04:15.855 --> 04:16.756
Oh gosh.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.391
-My anti drug charity.
-Yes, your drugs...

04:18.458 --> 04:20.426
[Ange] Anyway, I've still got
to finish the seating plan,

04:20.493 --> 04:21.694
and laminate everything.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.365
So anyway I've arranged for you
to dance with Slimon, Simon.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.466
No! Please no.

04:26.532 --> 04:27.734
I can come on my own.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.137
[Ange] No! You can't enter
a dance competition

04:31.204 --> 04:34.574
without a dance partner.
You need a partner...

04:36.000 --> 04:37.243
Look, it would just look good

04:37.310 --> 04:38.645
in front of the other
Senior Partners.

04:38.711 --> 04:39.846
Yeah I'll bring someone.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.981
Okay. Lauren!

04:42.048 --> 04:45.652
I know it's tricky,
everyone bringing their

04:45.718 --> 04:47.587
significant others
and you not having one.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.491
Ange! But I have plenty
of options. Trust me.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.196
Right? But you wouldn't bring
someone inappropriate would
you?

04:58.164 --> 04:59.632
Ah, I'll dance with Alex.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.435
Ah, nope, no,
I'm the compere.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.737
Simon it is.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.605
Absolutely not.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.273
-I love pretzels.
-So do I.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.575
Thank you. I'll bring someone.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.479
[Ange] Well ah, I'll need
a name by tomorrow morning.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.348
I have to laminate.

05:18.000 --> 05:18.885
They don't
laminate themselves.

05:19.185 --> 05:19.919
Any doctors?

05:19.986 --> 05:23.856
Oh yeah, John 35,
podiatrist?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.258
Feet, please no.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.093
Well, because I love you,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.828
we've got a literal
spreadsheet of men.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.296
Any astronauts?

05:31.230 --> 05:33.566
Okay, Ange is taking Bob
to capoeira lessons

05:33.633 --> 05:35.234
so we need to take
this seriously, okay?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.470
Of course she is.
'Dancer' is what we need.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.639
Dancer, dancer. Brett.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.307
[both] Engineer, dancer.

05:42.000 --> 05:42.842
[Alex] Here he is,
let's take a look.

05:43.309 --> 05:44.644
[both exclaim]

05:45.111 --> 05:46.979
[Lauren] It is so good
to see you again.

05:47.046 --> 05:47.947
You're joking right?

05:48.014 --> 05:51.718
I only came here to
tell you face-to-face,

05:51.784 --> 05:53.686
you're a horrible person.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.587
Sorry?

05:54.654 --> 05:56.122
Sorry for never
calling me back?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.858
You know you actually
ghosted me?

05:58.925 --> 05:59.659
Did I?

06:00.000 --> 06:00.927
Yes, and I thought we had fun.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.362
We did. We had so much fun.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.764
And you were the
one who said,

06:06.000 --> 06:06.099
"Oh you know,
we should do this again".

06:06.165 --> 06:09.235
-I must've lost your number.
-Oh please.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.603
Or you slipped
onto the other tab.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.038
Tab, what does that even mean?

06:12.105 --> 06:13.239
-What tab?
-On the spreadsheet?

06:13.306 --> 06:14.807
-What was that, spreadsheet?
-What?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.442
[Brett] What did you say,
spreadsheet?

06:18.000 --> 06:18.077
Spreadsheet, yeah.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.580
Well, it's actually
more of a planner.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.583
You got a fucking spreadsheet?

06:24.000 --> 06:24.584
It's nothing personal.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.752
It's just a way of
keeping track of everyone.

06:25.818 --> 06:26.753
Everyone?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.991
So, you're rating men who
you're sleeping with?

06:32.058 --> 06:35.461
No, God.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.296
What an awful thing to suggest.

06:37.363 --> 06:38.464
It sounds like a league table,
is that it?

06:38.531 --> 06:40.566
Well yeah, no.

06:40.633 --> 06:41.801
-No?
-No.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.670
Tell me, where am I on this
fucking spreadsheet of yours?

06:44.737 --> 06:46.205
Okay, well I guess if
I didn't call you back.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.141
-Yeah?
-You are probably

06:48.207 --> 06:53.780
-on the reject tab.
-Tab, right, Jesus Christ.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.819
Do you want to go to the
thing tomorrow night?

07:00.553 --> 07:01.554
Just...

07:06.000 --> 07:07.727
Yeah, there's no chance he's
going to let me take him.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.896
Ah, that's a pity,
he'd look great in Hugo Boss.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.731
So did the Nazis.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.733
Who am I going to take
to the ball, Alex?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.968
I will not let Ange be right.

07:16.035 --> 07:17.069
How about Matt?

07:18.000 --> 07:18.604
Gave him chlamydia.

07:18.671 --> 07:19.972
Yeah and quite possibly nits.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.441
Yeah and also it
might seem a bit datey.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.646
Ah, hang on a second, Alex.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.949
[upbeat music]

07:32.318 --> 07:35.188
[school bell chimes]
[children playing]

07:36.000 --> 07:40.960
Mum, this is Maddy, she's my
best friend, like seriously.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.096
Oh, well,
nice to meet you, Maddy.

07:44.163 --> 07:45.898
Hi, will you buy
me a cake please?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.500
The money goes to the church.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.403
[chuckles] Well, yeah,
I suppose I will.

07:50.469 --> 07:51.270
Me too.

07:51.337 --> 07:52.104
Me three.

07:54.000 --> 07:54.907
I said 'me T.O.O.'
not 'me T.W.O'

07:54.974 --> 07:56.542
It doesn't matter.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.110
It's not a homophone.

07:58.177 --> 07:59.812
Okay, that's enough.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.947
Can I tempt you?

08:02.882 --> 08:04.417
Yes, I think you can.

08:04.483 --> 08:05.952
It's homemade cream filling.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.054
Oh, here,
Maddalena actually makes

08:08.120 --> 08:10.489
the most incredible
Sfogliatelle Ricce.

08:10.556 --> 08:11.457
Oh wow.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.327
You must try it,
it is light as a feather.

08:14.393 --> 08:15.862
Oh my goodness.

08:16.863 --> 08:17.697
Thank you.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.268
[Lola] That was
a big mouth full.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.870
You know, I can
give you the recipe.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.339
Thanks, I do love to bake.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.277
It's quite incredible, right?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.111
Incredible.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.546
She does a great job.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.882
There you go.

08:38.317 --> 08:39.752
[Lola] Come on.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.922
Bye, BFF Maddy.

08:42.989 --> 08:46.192
Sexy baker, suck on that Ange.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.394
[upbeat music]

08:49.095 --> 08:50.696
[Abby] Ah you have
sticky hands.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.766
[Lauren] Oh, come on Abby,
that's not nice.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.601
How would you feel if she
wouldn't hold your hand?

08:55.668 --> 08:57.169
I wouldn't care.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.373
All right, well, what if I
didn't want to hold your hand

09:00.439 --> 09:02.541
and wasn't being very nice?

09:02.608 --> 09:03.943
I'd still have Dad.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.414
Well, what if Mum and Dad
didn't want to play with you
anymore?

09:08.681 --> 09:10.349
I'd be fine.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.053
Yeah, I'd just walk in the
woods at night and find a new
mum.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.422
Well, that's good to know.

09:18.000 --> 09:18.457
[upbeat music]

09:19.692 --> 09:22.295
[knocking]

09:26.065 --> 09:28.501
[Dallas] Hey, oh nice shoes.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.437
I'm just delivering you
guys some protein.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.571
Protein?

09:32.638 --> 09:35.574
Yeah, I figured you could
probably use some after...

09:36.409 --> 09:37.677
These guys are
the best burritos--

09:37.743 --> 09:38.911
You can't just
come to my house.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.947
Oh, the beef is smoked
over Mesquite wood so it's--

09:42.000 --> 09:42.882
Yeah, as I ordered.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.319
Oh, yes.

09:48.000 --> 09:48.888
So thank you,
Uber delivery guy.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.725
-Cool.
-Are these pickled jalapenos?

09:54.000 --> 09:54.894
You are welcome little lady.

09:54.961 --> 09:58.264
[upbeat music]

10:01.767 --> 10:02.935
[door slams]

10:06.000 --> 10:06.105
[Helena] So tired,
I'm sick of it.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.040
I feel like a
bloody unpaid cleaner.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.375
Literally all I do
is pick shit up,

10:09.442 --> 10:10.743
clean shit all fucking day.

10:12.000 --> 10:12.778
No one ever says a
goddamn thing, I'm done.

10:12.845 --> 10:16.015
I know, I miss you,
God I miss you.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.318
I miss you too, God,
when are you coming home?

10:19.385 --> 10:21.787
Soon, I don't know.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.991
Oh okay, I just need
to get it out.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.626
I'm all right now, God,
what are you wearing?

10:30.000 --> 10:30.429
I've got a date, with a...

10:31.163 --> 10:32.164
..DILF.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.432
Oh, there's no way
I'd date any of the dads

10:33.499 --> 10:34.600
from our school.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.269
You must have hot Aussie dads
like Chris Hemsworth.

10:37.536 --> 10:38.304
[knock on door]

10:38.371 --> 10:41.240
Oh, that's Alex,
I'll see you soon.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.677
-Love you.
-I love you, bye.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.712
[bouncy music]

10:54.086 --> 10:57.089
-Are we having a rave?
-Yes, absolutely.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.660
Okay, bye,
and no matter what she says,

11:01.727 --> 11:03.763
she's not allowed
coffee or martinis now.

11:03.829 --> 11:04.797
-Okay?
-Got it.

11:06.000 --> 11:06.232
But I assume espresso martinis
are fine, right?

11:06.298 --> 11:07.533
-Yep, that's fine.
-Got it.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.369
I can't believe you
picked up in the playground.

11:10.436 --> 11:11.937
Yeah, do you think
it's inappropriate?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.773
Yes, definitely.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.508
Now bugger off so
I can teach them

11:15.574 --> 11:16.809
how to smoke
methamphetamine.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.513
-Okay, bye.
-Bye-bye, all right.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.882
-Eat this.
-Okay.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.252
Oh, that's pretty good.

11:26.318 --> 11:27.887
It came from an Uber man.

11:28.587 --> 11:29.789
Are those pickles?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.591
Jalapenos, yes, you're clever.

11:32.658 --> 11:34.193
Correct, all righty.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.628
Hit the lights,
hit the lights.

11:36.796 --> 11:37.963
Yeah!

11:38.030 --> 11:38.831
[energetic music]

11:42.000 --> 11:42.068
Jalapenos, jalapenos,
jalapenos.

11:43.569 --> 11:47.073
[soft piano music]

11:48.000 --> 11:49.008
You know, it's actually
Maddalena's recipe.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.210
Oh wow, gosh,
that's very impressive.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.014
The girls do seem
to be good friends.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.483
Well, Maddalena makes
friends pretty easily.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.185
Yeah, she does seem very--

12:00.000 --> 12:00.419
Advanced?

12:00.486 --> 12:01.487
Yeah, I know.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.990
Yeah, she's actually
reading a year level ahead,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.627
but I know that she likes to
help out the younger kids.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.096
Younger?

12:10.162 --> 12:11.497
Well they're in the same year.

12:12.000 --> 12:12.832
But yeah, it means she tells me

12:12.898 --> 12:15.668
that Lola's still struggling
with her phonetics?

12:15.734 --> 12:17.570
Well, she's only
just turned five.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.672
No, don't worry,
she'll get there.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.674
More wine?

12:21.740 --> 12:23.776
Yes please.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.579
[wine splashing]

12:28.114 --> 12:29.615
There's this thing
tomorrow night,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.517
I don't suppose you're free.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.153
Well, will you be wearing
another sexy dress?

12:36.000 --> 12:36.755
Yes I can.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.724
Yeah, well then, wow.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.360
Yes, whatever it is.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.296
Great, well, I'll
give you the details.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.632
You'll ah, give me what?

12:46.699 --> 12:47.933
The details.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.769
Sure, see I love details.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.473
I'm very attentive to details.

12:55.741 --> 12:57.543
I'll bear that in mind.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.482
[kissing]

13:06.000 --> 13:08.320
[classical music]

13:08.387 --> 13:09.388
Oh.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.733
Oh yeah, that'll work.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.151
[Lauren moans]

13:39.818 --> 13:41.153
[Dom] Call me Christ.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.556
Wait, what?

13:43.622 --> 13:45.724
I said call me Christ.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.028
Can I call you Chris instead?

I'm not going to
finish this alphabet

14:00.000 --> 14:01.173
until you call me Christ.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.978

Call me Christ.

[music crescendos]

14:24.000 --> 14:24.430
[elevator dings]

14:25.764 --> 14:29.201
Hi, I've got some
of those pretzels.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.171
Oh, yeah, really?

14:33.205 --> 14:35.207
And I found someone
for the ball.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.443
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:37.509 --> 14:38.978
-Name?
-Dom.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.179
Phone number?

14:43.649 --> 14:45.651
Haven't transferred it yet.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.055
This a real person?

14:50.122 --> 14:52.157
-Yeah.
-Surname?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.227
Inic.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.196
-Dom Inic?
-Yes.

14:58.530 --> 14:59.365
Hmm.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.733
[phone rings]

15:00.799 --> 15:02.401
It's the school.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.070
Hello?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.006
[upbeat music]

15:12.000 --> 15:12.111
So, Lola, this time she's
brought wine to school.

15:12.177 --> 15:13.679
-Wine?
-Red wine.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.115
Decanted into two
plastic drink bottles.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.717
Right, well, clever.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.420
She was discovered at
morning break with a friend

15:24.000 --> 15:24.490
and they had both spilled
wine all over themselves.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.725
And you're sure
it was Lola's wine?

15:26.792 --> 15:28.894
Yes, but she's adamant
it's the blood of Christ.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.329
Blood of Christ, okay.

15:30.396 --> 15:31.563
I presume they were
going to attempt

15:31.630 --> 15:33.832
some kind of holy communion.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.669
Maybe teaching religion
in a supposedly

15:36.735 --> 15:38.971
nondenominational school
is a bit confusing.

15:39.038 --> 15:40.205
Lola's enrolled in ethics.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.206
Yeah, but I think

15:42.000 --> 15:43.442
she's been sneaking
into Catholic scripture.

15:43.509 --> 15:47.446
She's got this
new friend and oh--

15:48.000 --> 15:49.281
Your daughter
brought wine to school

15:49.348 --> 15:50.683
and just gave it to Maddalena?

15:54.000 --> 15:54.286
Well, obviously there
was a bit of collusion.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.321
What does that mean?

15:55.387 --> 15:56.655
Well, Lola wouldn't
know the first thing

15:56.722 --> 15:57.890
about the blood of Christ.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.160
Do not bring Christ
into this conversation.

16:01.226 --> 16:02.995
Clearly you need to
talk to your daughter

16:03.062 --> 16:04.496
about respecting religion.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.099
Well, clearly your daughter
has been speaking to Lola.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.535
Yes, she was being generous,
letting Lola be her friend.

16:09.601 --> 16:10.436
Wow, wow.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.805
And what sort of a person
just lets their daughter

16:12.871 --> 16:14.139
have access to wine.

16:14.206 --> 16:17.343
She doesn't have access
to it, she's sneaky.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.113
Okay, okay.
Let's just...

16:21.914 --> 16:23.882
The girls are both
covered in wine

16:24.000 --> 16:25.784
so obviously
they'll have to go home.

16:25.851 --> 16:29.722
And for now there will be no
further disciplinary action.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.156
Okay, she's in
the nurses office?

16:31.223 --> 16:34.326
But, as this is Lola's
second time

16:36.000 --> 16:36.962
bringing something
inappropriate to school,

16:37.029 --> 16:39.832
we will really need
to monitor her.

16:39.898 --> 16:41.066
Yeah, I know.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.269
[upbeat music]

16:51.110 --> 16:52.344
What were you thinking, Lola?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.116
I was thinking that his blood
removes the punishment of sin.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.784
Oh okay.

17:00.000 --> 17:00.719
John verse one chapter seven.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.821
Don't need to know
the verse, but thanks.

17:06.000 --> 17:06.458
Anyway, Maggy said I had
to bring it in or she--

17:06.525 --> 17:10.095
Can you just stop bringing
things into school please?

17:10.162 --> 17:10.996
Yeah?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.433
I just need, well,
I just wondered

17:14.500 --> 17:15.968
if you could watch her
for half an hour?

17:18.000 --> 17:18.003
-Yeah?
-I knew this day would come.

17:18.070 --> 17:18.737
Jake's not answering

17:19.037 --> 17:20.272
and I've got the meeting
with the Partners.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.807
No need, it's absolutely fine.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.510
Come here Lols.

17:24.576 --> 17:25.444
What's that, is that wine?

17:25.511 --> 17:26.812
-Mhmm.
-Shiraz.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.614
Oh, tell me it was from
the Barossa at least.

17:30.000 --> 17:30.082
Okay, so look
at me darling, okay.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.184
Did somebody speak?

17:32.251 --> 17:34.353
That's brilliant,
I just wanted to say

17:34.420 --> 17:35.921
that you do not
need friends like that.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.189
Okay, great.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.257
Thank you.

17:38.323 --> 17:39.691
-They're in the meeting room.
-Thank you, yeah.

17:42.000 --> 17:42.861
Ange, Ange.

17:42.928 --> 17:44.163
-But we'll talk, talk--
-Ange.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.364
Oh uh, one second.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.065
Sorry, sorry.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.469
Do you mind if we take
Dom Inic off the list, please?

17:50.536 --> 17:52.304
Yes I mind,
he's already laminated.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.139
No, no, no, I really
need to take him off it.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.541
Really?

17:55.607 --> 17:59.244
What about the table plan
and who would you dance with?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.313
-Well.
-Now, I could ask Simon.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.115
-No, no, no, no.
-Please!

18:03.182 --> 18:04.950
I already have him
laminated, just...

18:06.785 --> 18:07.953
Okay.

18:12.000 --> 18:12.357
So as I was saying...

18:12.424 --> 18:15.027
[upbeat music]

18:18.000 --> 18:20.499
So, Abby told me what happened.

18:20.999 --> 18:23.435
We need to talk about the wine.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.538
-Yeah.
-I don't think she's talking.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.441
No, come on Lola, please
stop this not talking thing.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.011
-It's over.
-It's never over.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.279
Ah, okay, she is.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.716
And now I don't have a
real best friend any more.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.352
Oh Lola, she wasn't
a very nice friend, okay?

18:42.000 --> 18:42.554
Hey, you don't have to
take wine to school

18:42.621 --> 18:44.256
to make friends,
all right sweetheart?

18:44.323 --> 18:46.992
I just wanted to be
someone's best friend.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.029
Oh baby, I know,
but you're so special.

18:54.000 --> 18:54.299
You'll find a better,
more worthy,

18:54.366 --> 18:56.168
more special friend, okay?

18:56.235 --> 18:58.403
Mum's right, hey,

19:00.000 --> 19:00.839
she sounds like a bit of
a squashed potato anyway.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.308
[Lola laughs]

19:04.409 --> 19:05.277
Who was it?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.379
It was Maddy,
dad's called Dom.

19:07.446 --> 19:08.280
Oh, you know him?

19:08.347 --> 19:09.114
Ah, do I know him?

19:09.181 --> 19:10.883
-Umm.
-What?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.085
Uh, um.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.458
You know.
[clapping]

19:19.525 --> 19:20.626
What?

19:22.828 --> 19:23.829
[whispers] You fucked him?

19:24.363 --> 19:26.198
Lola's friend's dad?

19:26.265 --> 19:27.032
Jesus Loz.

19:27.099 --> 19:27.900
Right?

19:30.000 --> 19:30.869
How's the air up there
on your massive high horse?

19:31.169 --> 19:32.571
Rosy.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.173
["Your Time" by ORUS playing]

19:36.575 --> 19:39.978
# Do you remember the days
When you said #

19:42.000 --> 19:44.116
# Nothing gets in your way #

19:44.182 --> 19:47.719
# You were led by the
Beat and the music #

19:48.000 --> 19:49.187
[music lowers]

19:50.055 --> 19:53.759
Okay, well done everyone,
the scores are being tallied.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.461
And remember tonight
we are digging deep for

19:56.528 --> 19:58.297
F.L.A.I.D...

20:00.000 --> 20:01.967
Ah, the Family Lawyers Against
Illegal Drugs

20:02.034 --> 20:03.702
Consultant Help Group.

20:04.169 --> 20:05.737
Yeah, umm...

20:06.071 --> 20:08.140
Great, let's have a five
minute break for everyone.

20:08.206 --> 20:11.043
[music continues]

20:12.778 --> 20:13.946
[Lauren] Did I miss anything?

20:14.012 --> 20:16.181
No, only about an hour of my
life that I'll never get back.

20:16.248 --> 20:17.182
Hi girls, how's it going?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.384
-Hi.
-May I have this dance?

20:19.451 --> 20:20.686
Thank you so much.

20:20.752 --> 20:21.853
Come this this way...

20:23.221 --> 20:23.989
Hi.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.157
Hi, how lovely,
thank you.

20:25.223 --> 20:26.825
-Do you want some water?
-Yes please.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.594
You should have told me you
were bringing your kids.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.763
It was inappropriate,
yeah, I'm sorry.

20:31.830 --> 20:35.267
No, I would have laminated
them a name card.

20:36.000 --> 20:36.668
Oh.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.271
I'd like a laminated
name card, please.

20:39.338 --> 20:40.439
Would you?

20:42.000 --> 20:42.774
Well, I can do one for you
tomorrow if you'd like.

20:42.841 --> 20:45.644
Thank you Ange,
that's very nice.

20:45.711 --> 20:46.979
So where's Bob?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.881
Ah, um.

20:50.549 --> 20:53.118
Well, actually he's
double booked himself.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.157
He's um, he's been with the
anglers, his angling meeting.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.258
Right?

21:00.325 --> 21:02.761
I probably should have
just brought my kids.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.162
Much better idea.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.063
Yeah.

21:06.000 --> 21:06.932
You guys want to start a
conga line, or something?

21:07.199 --> 21:09.334
No? Paso doble? No?

21:12.000 --> 21:12.437
A different movie.
Merengue?

21:13.271 --> 21:14.539
-Okay.
-Cool.

21:18.000 --> 21:18.744
So, are you talking
to your mum again?

21:18.810 --> 21:20.779
Yeah because I
think she's right.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.148
-Really?
-Maddy is a twat.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.350
Yup, okay, great.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.819
So I might find a
different friend.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.287
Yeah, that's a good idea.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.522
Someone who isn't mean

21:30.589 --> 21:32.524
or tells me I have to
bring wine to school.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.126
Why did she do that?

21:34.192 --> 21:35.093
She said I had to,

21:36.000 --> 21:37.562
or she'd take me off
her best friends list,

21:37.629 --> 21:39.264
and she did anyway.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.168
-What, is this it?
-Yeah.

21:43.235 --> 21:46.204
Oh, that's horrible,
that's really mean.

21:46.271 --> 21:47.873
[Lauren] Yeah, it's horrible.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.175
Who cares about this thing?

21:50.242 --> 21:52.244
Let's get up and dance.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.181
# It's your time
To party, to party #

22:00.000 --> 22:01.153
# And get the life
To party, to party #

22:06.000 --> 22:08.260
Well, I'm impressed,
Dom sounds like a real gem.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.094
Yeah.

22:09.327 --> 22:10.595
Messiah complexes are
notoriously difficult

22:10.662 --> 22:11.730
to come by nowadays.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.732
Do you think maybe our Lord
and saviour Jesus Christ

22:13.799 --> 22:15.033
is trying to tell
you something?

22:15.100 --> 22:17.869
Yeah, maybe that we should have
a religious proclivities
column.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.638
Oh I never told you,
I once dated a guy

22:19.705 --> 22:21.039
who used to cry for
Jesus' forgiveness

22:21.106 --> 22:22.374
every time he ejaculated.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.076
Oow, did Jesus
forgive him?

22:24.142 --> 22:26.378
Yes, yes I did.

22:27.779 --> 22:28.613
Well that's exactly
what I mean when you--

22:28.680 --> 22:29.681
[Dallas] There she is.

22:30.000 --> 22:30.782
Jesus Christ!

22:31.917 --> 22:34.286
This one's dedicated
to you Lauren.

Some class yeah #

22:42.000 --> 22:44.463
# And a hot mamma ass yeah #

22:48.000 --> 22:49.935
# She's a working woman
Hell yeah #

22:50.202 --> 22:51.470
What's happening?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.107
# And she's gonna
Make me swell yeah #

23:00.000 --> 23:00.946
# She keeps me on
My tip-toes babe #

23:01.246 --> 23:05.684
# She's got the right
To know babe #

23:06.384 --> 23:11.823
# We'll be married
In the afterlife #

23:13.592 --> 23:17.362
# Cos we were lovers
In a past life #

23:18.000 --> 23:19.631
Yeah, he's definitely not
getting feelings at all is he?

23:19.698 --> 23:22.367
-Yeah, take him off the list.
-Absolutely.

23:24.000 --> 23:24.603
# You and me Lauren #

23:30.000 --> 23:30.342
# And I want you to have #

23:31.409 --> 23:35.947
# My babies #
