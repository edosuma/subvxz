00:00.166 --> 00:01.750
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:01.834 --> 00:04.208
If someone hurt her,
I want them dead.

00:04.291 --> 00:05.333
<i>Sometimes...</i>

00:05.417 --> 00:08.166
I'm out of money.
In a few weeks I'll be screwed.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.834
- Think about looking for a job.
- Ha!

00:10.917 --> 00:12.583
<i>The answers...</i>

00:12.667 --> 00:14.834
Tell me what he said
and I can fix it.

00:14.917 --> 00:17.750
- I can't.
<i>- ...to life's biggest questions...</i>

00:17.834 --> 00:20.000
<i>I had the nightmare again.</i>

00:20.083 --> 00:22.250
<i>And the name "Angela"?</i>

00:22.333 --> 00:24.917
<i>- That's my real name.</i>
<i>- ...are buried...</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:27.875
She's not been dead a month
and it's like she never existed.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.500
<i>...under bigger lies.</i>

00:29.583 --> 00:34.750
- Zach was telling Julie about Dana.
- He didn't mean to kill Dana.

00:39.959 --> 00:44.500
<i>Most mothers will tell you</i>
<i>their children are a gift from God.</i>

00:44.667 --> 00:48.583
<i>Most mothers will also tell you</i>
<i>the gifts their children give them</i>

00:48.667 --> 00:51.583
<i>are less than heavenly.</i>

00:52.583 --> 00:57.709
<i>Lynette had suffered through art work</i>
<i>made in kindergarten...</i>

00:58.667 --> 01:02.834
<i>...spice racks made in summer camp...</i>

01:03.542 --> 01:07.583
<i>...and jewelry</i>
<i>made at the scout jamboree.</i>

01:07.667 --> 01:09.417
<i>On this day...</i>

01:09.500 --> 01:13.917
<i>...Lynette Scavo received a gift</i>
<i>every mother dreams of.</i>

01:14.583 --> 01:16.917
<i>One she wasn't embarrassed to display.</i>

01:17.000 --> 01:20.166
- Where did you guys get this pot?
- We made it.

01:20.250 --> 01:22.875
Really? I love it.

01:23.667 --> 01:28.125
Well, this is the nicest present
you boys have ever given me.

01:28.208 --> 01:32.458
I'll put it out on the front porch
so the whole neighborhood can enjoy it.

01:33.709 --> 01:37.667
<i>Lynette would cherish</i>
<i>the memory of that moment</i>

01:37.750 --> 01:41.000
<i>for the rest of her life.</i>

01:41.083 --> 01:45.333
<i>The memory of that moment</i>
<i>was ruined the very next day.</i>

01:51.625 --> 01:55.083
Mrs. McCluskey,
why are you taking my flower pot?

01:55.166 --> 01:57.542
It's mine. Your boys stole it.

01:57.625 --> 02:01.250
No, no, no. My sons made that
for me for Valentine's Day!

02:01.375 --> 02:05.458
I bought this in Costa Rica
on my last cruise. You see?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.917
It's still got the price tag on it.

02:09.750 --> 02:13.250
What? Nothing more to say?
Cat got your tongue?

02:13.333 --> 02:16.583
You listen to me,
keep your brats off my property.

02:16.709 --> 02:23.083
<i>Yes, most mothers will tell you</i>
<i>their children are a gift from God.</i>

02:24.166 --> 02:27.000
<i>Most mothers will also tell you</i>

02:27.083 --> 02:30.667
<i>there are some days</i>
<i>when you wish you could return them.</i>

03:12.458 --> 03:16.458
<i>It was the day before Valentine's Day</i>
<i>and every man on Wisteria Lane</i>

03:16.542 --> 03:20.959
<i>was preparing for this</i>
<i>most dangerous of holidays.</i>

03:21.083 --> 03:23.458
<i>While some purchased</i>
<i>romantic cards...</i>

03:26.583 --> 03:30.417
<i>...and some brought home</i>
<i>candy and flowers...</i>

03:31.000 --> 03:34.583
<i>and some made dinner reservations</i>
<i>at fancy restaurants...</i>

03:36.250 --> 03:41.625
<i>...others managed to forget</i>
<i>about the day entirely... again.</i>

03:41.709 --> 03:47.667
<i>This flurry of activity was lost</i>
<i>on the women of Wisteria Lane.</i>

03:47.750 --> 03:51.750
<i>They were busy learning</i>
<i>a secret about their neighbors.</i>

03:51.834 --> 03:56.083
<i>A secret</i>
<i>that was positively heartbreaking.</i>

03:56.166 --> 03:59.250
So Paul said
that Zachary killed Dana?

03:59.333 --> 04:00.375
Yeah.

04:00.458 --> 04:04.417
It must have been an accident.
Boys don't just kill their sisters.

04:04.500 --> 04:09.792
That boy is seriously disturbed and
I've forbidden Julie from seeing him.

04:10.875 --> 04:15.458
So this is it. This is the secret
that Mary Alice was trying to protect.

04:15.542 --> 04:17.417
The guilt she lived with.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.125
I never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of feel sorry for Paul.

04:21.208 --> 04:24.500
I wish I could.
I still feel like something's not right.

04:24.583 --> 04:27.625
- What do you mean?
- We've all been in their house.

04:27.709 --> 04:30.375
Have you ever seen a picture
of another kid?

04:30.542 --> 04:33.959
Why keep Dana's baby blanket
and throw out all the photos?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.875
That's a good point.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.709
And why did Mary Alice refer to herself
as "Angela" in therapy?

04:39.792 --> 04:44.208
Mary Alice loved Zach
more than anything in the world.

04:44.291 --> 04:47.000
When you love a child that much...

04:48.166 --> 04:51.208
You're capable of doing
all sorts of things.

04:54.875 --> 04:56.959
Yeah.

05:04.792 --> 05:10.500
Hello? These were delivered
to my house by mistake. May I?

05:10.583 --> 05:12.500
They're for Mary Alice Young.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.834
Oh, my God.

05:15.917 --> 05:19.500
I had a standing order
with the florist.

05:19.583 --> 05:21.917
I forgot to cancel it.

05:23.542 --> 05:27.500
Mary Alice was my wife.
She passed away a few months ago.

05:30.583 --> 05:33.291
I'm very sorry for your loss.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.000
And I'm sorry for yours.

05:35.083 --> 05:38.834
- Pardon?
- Your sister? Martha?

05:38.959 --> 05:43.125
Oh... yes... her.

05:46.166 --> 05:49.125
Good Lord, that's Angela.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.959
What?

05:52.041 --> 05:56.667
Angela Forrest. We worked together
in Utah. It must be 15 years ago.

05:56.792 --> 06:00.917
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
My wife's name was Mary Alice.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.125
She's never been to Utah.

06:06.083 --> 06:11.625
Well, I could be mistaken.
As I said, it's been years.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.834
No, Mickey, you're wrong.
I wasn't acting like a diva.

06:21.959 --> 06:26.583
I left the boat show because that
coordinator was making passes at me.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.959
I mean, it's not my fault.
Yao Lin, you missed a spot.

06:30.041 --> 06:34.083
No, spare me the lecture
and just book me another job, quick.

06:34.166 --> 06:38.125
Carlos and I are up to our asses
in bills and we can't pay 'em.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.333
Fine. Bye.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.792
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.583
Are you gonna clean that spot?

06:55.667 --> 06:58.834
- Which one?
- The one I told you to clean.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.834
I get to it.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.625
Clean it now.

07:13.709 --> 07:16.750
- Why?
- Because I said so.

07:18.166 --> 07:22.041
OK. But you got to say please.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.959
Fine. Please.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.792
Anything to get you back on your knees
scrubbing where you belong.

07:35.875 --> 07:40.000
- You're not better than me.
- Excuse me?

07:40.083 --> 07:45.542
The only reason you have anything
in your life is because you're pretty.

07:45.625 --> 07:49.917
One day you'll be old and
when that happens, you'll be nothing.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.750
You are so fired.

07:55.917 --> 07:58.250
No kidding.

08:07.750 --> 08:11.834
Valentine's Day card. It's pretty.
And meticulously hand-painted.

08:11.917 --> 08:14.458
Whoever sent you that
must really love you.

08:15.709 --> 08:21.333
- And be loaded with talent.
- It's beautiful. Thanks.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.458
We still on for tomorrow night?

08:23.542 --> 08:26.458
I got reservations at Le Petit Fleur.

08:26.583 --> 08:30.333
That place is so pretentious.
I've been dying to go there.

08:30.417 --> 08:33.792
Boys? Get your little fannies inside.

08:34.959 --> 08:36.959
Guys?

08:37.083 --> 08:39.250
Poor, Lynette.

08:39.333 --> 08:43.792
If she doesn't get a new nanny soon,
she's gonna implode.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.041
Hey, guys.
Who you hiding from?

08:50.125 --> 08:52.792
- Our mom.
- She wants to spank us.

08:52.875 --> 08:55.500
Did you do something bad?

08:56.125 --> 08:58.750
If you hide out too long,
she'll get worried.

08:58.834 --> 09:02.667
Then she'll get madder.
You know what I say? Go on home.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.834
Decent chance you'll have
the rest of day to play.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.667
Come on, climb aboard.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.458
All right.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.834
- Pretty impressive.
- I love kids.

09:18.917 --> 09:21.000
Can't wait to have my own some day.

09:33.959 --> 09:37.542
- We don't want to get spanked.
- We promise we'll be good.

09:37.667 --> 09:40.834
Too late. You stole.
And then you lied.

09:40.959 --> 09:44.458
Even worse, you made me look bad
in front of Mrs. McCluskey,

09:44.542 --> 09:47.208
who you know
is Mommy's sworn enemy.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.917
Time to pick your poison.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.875
How about a belt? It's a classic.

09:53.959 --> 09:57.542
Well, we could go
with the old hickory stick.

09:57.625 --> 09:58.917
It's a cliché,

09:59.041 --> 10:00.542
but it's effective.

10:00.667 --> 10:05.125
I know. We'll go with the spatula.
The holes give it less wind resistance.

10:06.166 --> 10:09.083
- Moves faster.
- No! No, no, no, no.

10:09.166 --> 10:13.625
Guys! Hey, my hands are tied.
Thieves get spanked.

10:13.709 --> 10:15.750
Just the way it works.

10:17.542 --> 10:19.709
- Unless...
- Unless what?

10:21.375 --> 10:24.959
For a first time offence,
if you swear,

10:25.083 --> 10:29.417
cross your heart,
that you will never, never steal again,

10:29.542 --> 10:33.125
and you write Mrs. McCluskey
a letter of apology,

10:33.250 --> 10:35.083
I will let it slide.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.083
- OK!
- Yeah! We swear.

10:37.166 --> 10:42.542
All right, start with
“Dear Mrs. McCluskey...”

10:44.583 --> 10:47.417
Mommy? Why are you smiling?

10:47.500 --> 10:50.750
Do you know what
"psychological warfare" means?

10:50.834 --> 10:53.959
- No.
- Well, too bad for you.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.583
OK, start with a big "M", "C"...

10:57.583 --> 10:58.667
Good.

10:59.542 --> 11:03.166
Rex and I are hosting a dinner party
for ten next week.

11:03.250 --> 11:06.709
We're using our best china
and serving duck.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.583
So, you and Rex
are a couple again?

11:09.667 --> 11:14.875
Yes. You know, that's one of things
I hated most about our separation.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.375
Not being able
to throw dinner parties.

11:17.458 --> 11:22.166
There's just something so civilized
and elegant about them, don't you think?

11:22.250 --> 11:26.375
I take it you've resolved
your feelings about his infidelity?

11:26.458 --> 11:29.917
Let's just say
I've put them in an imaginary box

11:30.000 --> 11:33.458
and don't plan on looking
at them for a while.

11:33.542 --> 11:37.166
Is that the healthiest way
to achieve a reconciliation?

11:37.291 --> 11:39.375
Well, it won't be easy at first.

11:39.458 --> 11:43.917
There'll be a lot of forced smiles
and perfunctory love-making,

11:44.000 --> 11:48.208
but after a few decades whiz by,
I'm sure I'll find a way to forgive him.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.000
Well, as long as you have a plan.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.792
I do want to forgive him,

11:57.875 --> 12:02.834
but there's something
he's still not telling me.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.458
Really?

12:07.667 --> 12:10.917
I think it has something
to do with why he had the affair.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.166
- Have you confronted him?
- Once.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.917
You should have seen
the look in his eyes.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.083
He was terrified I'd figure it out.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
You know what it is, don't you?

12:25.125 --> 12:27.375
Bree, I can't discuss other patients.

12:28.959 --> 12:31.041
I realize that.

12:34.333 --> 12:38.125
This thing that he's hiding...
Is it bad?

12:42.125 --> 12:45.875
Oh, OK...

12:45.959 --> 12:48.458
Maybe it's better that I don't know.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.875
Bree, how does this reconciliation
have a chance

12:51.959 --> 12:56.333
if the two of you can't be honest
about the innermost parts of your life?

12:56.417 --> 12:58.625
We're WASPs, Dr Goldfine.

12:58.709 --> 13:02.458
Not acknowledging the elephant
in the room is what we do best.

13:02.542 --> 13:07.291
You'd settle for that? A life
filled with repression and denial?

13:08.625 --> 13:13.625
And the dinner parties.
Don't forget the dinner parties.

13:19.917 --> 13:23.500
And over there
you got your queens and...

13:23.625 --> 13:26.834
Your Quad Spring series,
and your deluxe 1000s,

13:26.917 --> 13:32.417
all the way to the Imperial Paradise.
Sweet racket, huh?

13:32.542 --> 13:37.667
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
and I can't believe I'm the Siesta King.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.875
Except for how I am.

13:39.959 --> 13:42.000
Very impressive.

13:42.083 --> 13:46.333
So, where does the photographer
want me for the shoot?

13:46.458 --> 13:49.959
Didn't your agent tell you?
There's no shoot.

13:50.083 --> 13:53.625
Well, then what did you hire me for?

13:55.041 --> 13:59.291
<i>You've heard the expression</i>
<i>"sex sells"? That's you.</i>

13:59.375 --> 14:03.041
<i>You're to remind people</i>
<i>there's a lot of fun things they can do</i>

14:03.125 --> 14:07.625
<i>on a Siesta King mattress</i>
<i>that don't involve sleep. Get it?</i>

14:29.375 --> 14:33.792
<i>It is often said that good fences</i>
<i>make good neighbors.</i>

14:35.250 --> 14:37.709
<i>But as Lynette was about to discover,</i>

14:37.834 --> 14:41.333
<i>the fence might just need</i>
<i>a little barbed wire</i>

14:41.458 --> 14:43.709
<i>if the neighbor is Mrs. McCluskey.</i>

14:43.834 --> 14:45.709
Hey!

14:49.083 --> 14:52.709
What do you think you are doing?
Get out of here.

14:52.834 --> 14:56.709
Your little criminals snuck into
my house and stole my wall clock.

14:56.834 --> 14:57.834
What?

14:57.917 --> 15:01.917
It was a hand-painted, purple
and white wall clock. My son made it.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.917
You sure you didn't misplace it?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.500
No offence, but you probably
forget where you put things.

15:07.583 --> 15:10.583
No offence,
but you should be sterilized.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.250
My boys do not
break into people's houses.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.625
They may have stolen your flowerpot.

15:15.709 --> 15:19.125
- They apologized for that.
- They wrote a note.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.834
The coward's way out.
They should've apologized in person.

15:22.917 --> 15:26.625
- This has been fun. But now...
- You let those boys run wild.

15:26.709 --> 15:30.917
Toys all over the yard, bikes out
in the street. It's a disgrace.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.041
Get out!

15:32.125 --> 15:35.291
Those boys would've been
better off raised by wolves.

15:35.375 --> 15:38.667
God knows they would have been cleaner.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.917
Valentine's Day is tomorrow.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.458
I know. I already bought your gifts.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.083
Roses and English toffee?

15:52.959 --> 15:55.667
Just like always.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.083
Yes. And I suppose we'll make love
tomorrow night, too.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.750
That is our little tradition.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.750
Good. I'm looking forward to it.

16:13.417 --> 16:16.250
Are you looking forward to it?

16:17.250 --> 16:18.291
What?

16:18.375 --> 16:21.417
I know that I don't...
please you sexually,

16:21.500 --> 16:25.125
so I was wondering if you were
looking forward to being with me.

16:25.208 --> 16:26.583
Oh, for God's sake.

16:26.667 --> 16:31.125
I'm sorry. I thought I could pretend
that this doesn't upset me anymore.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.750
- But I can't.
- Please, don't do this.

16:33.834 --> 16:38.542
You went to another woman for sex
to give you something I couldn't.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.375
At least tell me
what that something is.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.542
- Bree, I can't.
- Why not?

16:49.500 --> 16:54.792
Rex, please tell me. Let me
prove to you how much I love you.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.500
I like to be dominated.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.834
Sexually.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.291
Never mind.

17:14.417 --> 17:17.208
Rex, please,
I want to understand.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.375
<i>Please, Mistress, no.</i>

17:23.500 --> 17:25.458
<i>- Quiet, slave.</i>
<i>- Yes, mistress.</i>

17:25.542 --> 17:28.291
<i>- Turn your head. Don't look at me.</i>
<i>- Mistress...</i>

17:28.375 --> 17:32.000
<i>On your knees, now. Right now.</i>
<i>Tighten your cuff.</i>

17:32.083 --> 17:34.375
<i>- Yes, mistress.</i>
<i>- Do it now. Take it out.</i>

17:35.291 --> 17:36.583
<i>Yes. Yes!</i>

17:37.542 --> 17:40.500
<i>- Put it in your mouth.</i>
<i>- Yes, Mistress.</i>

17:42.750 --> 17:43.875
Well?

17:46.834 --> 17:49.917
- What did your mother do to you?
- What?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.125
This just reeks
of unresolved childhood trauma.

17:53.208 --> 17:56.625
It has nothing to do with my mother.
This is a preference.

17:56.709 --> 18:00.375
- It's a perversion.
- You promised to be supportive.

18:00.458 --> 18:01.959
What do you want me to say?

18:02.041 --> 18:05.709
My husband wears metal clamps
around his nipples, hooray?

18:05.792 --> 18:08.333
I want you to to try it.
Just once.

18:08.417 --> 18:12.500
Try what? Hurting you?
You actually want me to hurt you?

18:12.583 --> 18:15.250
So, I can feel pleasure, yes.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.500
Fine.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.583
So, was it good for you, too?

18:34.208 --> 18:36.291
Mike wants babies.

18:36.375 --> 18:39.375
- What?
- He wants to have kids.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.875
He had that look men get that says,

18:41.959 --> 18:45.709
“I'm ready to procreate,
point me to the nearest cervix".

18:46.250 --> 18:50.875
- And this is a problem?
- I can't have another baby.

18:50.959 --> 18:54.208
I'm so grateful I had you,
I don't regret a minute of that.

18:54.291 --> 18:58.333
But I found it
to be completely overwhelming.

18:58.417 --> 19:01.000
Sometimes I even wonder
how I got through it.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.667
You and me both.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.667
So, have you told Mike how you feel?

19:06.750 --> 19:09.709
I can't tell him.
This could be a deal-breaker.

19:09.792 --> 19:13.083
Julie, I really love him.
I don't want to lose him.

19:13.166 --> 19:17.917
Maybe you're overreacting.
I bet he'd rather have you than a baby.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.083
What if he doesn't?

19:20.917 --> 19:23.583
Then that's something
you need to know.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.709
<i>Susan shouldn't have been so worried.</i>

19:32.083 --> 19:35.000
<i>Children were the last thing</i>
<i>on Mike's mind.</i>

19:35.083 --> 19:39.333
<i>He was too busy</i>
<i>searching for answers</i>

19:39.417 --> 19:41.458
<i>in all the wrong places.</i>

20:37.667 --> 20:39.333
Please, just...

21:06.125 --> 21:09.792
You got lucky.
Didn't hit anything major.

21:14.041 --> 21:19.291
- Noah's getting impatient.
- Tell Noah I'm getting closer.

21:19.375 --> 21:21.333
- That's her, isn't it?
- Yeah.

21:21.417 --> 21:25.542
Hard to believe a kid from such
a good family could get so messed up.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.000
I met somebody
who recognized her photo.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.375
Thinks she rented a room
on Pine Avenue.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.583
I was checking out houses when...

21:33.667 --> 21:38.083
<i>Hey, Mike, it's me.</i>
<i>Are you there? Pick up. Hello?</i>

21:38.166 --> 21:42.000
OK, I know you're home.
Your lights are on.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.458
Look, I really need
to talk to you about something.

21:45.542 --> 21:47.625
You know what?
I'll just stop by.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.333
Hey.

21:50.417 --> 21:52.291
<i>I'm here.</i>

21:52.417 --> 21:54.417
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

21:54.542 --> 21:56.709
Yeah, I just... stubbed my toe.

22:01.291 --> 22:05.000
So, can I come over? I need
to talk to you about something.

22:05.083 --> 22:10.083
I got a buddy over here right now...
Can it wait till dinner tomorrow?

22:10.166 --> 22:15.375
It's kind of important.
Yeah, I guess it can wait.

22:15.458 --> 22:18.792
- <i>OK, see you at seven?</i>
- I'm counting the minutes.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.667
You should take it easy
for the next few days.

22:25.750 --> 22:31.208
I can't cancel. The last thing
I need is for her to get suspicious.

22:35.291 --> 22:39.500
Maybe it's my dementia, but I still
haven't found my purple wall clock.

22:39.583 --> 22:44.000
Nobody in my family knows
or cares where your stupid clock is.

22:44.125 --> 22:48.375
And tell your little criminals
to get their bikes out of the street.

22:48.458 --> 22:51.458
- I'll get it.
- No. Don't you dare.

22:51.542 --> 22:54.166
We'll move it when you say please.

23:06.333 --> 23:07.834
Please.

23:07.959 --> 23:11.000
OK, Lynette, let's not get crazy.

23:11.083 --> 23:15.667
<i>Even though it was Mrs. McCluskey</i>
<i>who had officially declared war,</i>

23:15.750 --> 23:19.875
<i>it was Lynette who decided</i>
<i>to deliver the opening salvo.</i>

23:19.959 --> 23:22.083
- You'll clean that up!
- Think so?

23:22.166 --> 23:23.750
Yes.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.917
<i>Yes, the war of Wisteria Lane</i>

23:30.000 --> 23:34.375
<i>would indeed prove to be messy</i>
<i>for everyone involved.</i>

23:35.709 --> 23:38.834
Pardon me? Pardon me?

23:38.917 --> 23:42.500
We were wondering
what the coil count is on this one.

23:47.417 --> 23:48.875
Sorry.

23:59.709 --> 24:01.375
What is this?

24:01.458 --> 24:06.250
People keep coming and talking to me.
Asking me questions. That is not my job.

24:06.333 --> 24:11.291
- You don't have to be rude.
- I am not a mattress salesperson.

24:12.041 --> 24:15.542
Is there something wrong
with being a mattress salesperson?

24:15.667 --> 24:20.834
- Is it beneath you or something?
- Honestly? Yes. I'm a model.

24:20.917 --> 24:25.041
Your agent warned me
that you were a diva. And he was right.

24:25.125 --> 24:27.458
You won't talk to the customers,

24:27.542 --> 24:30.417
and you didn't chip in
for Hazel's birthday cake.

24:30.500 --> 24:35.959
- I just met the woman today.
- That didn't stop you having a piece.

24:36.083 --> 24:40.709
I'm sorry. But I don't want someone
in my store that's not a team player.

24:40.792 --> 24:43.291
- Oh, no. Wait.
- You're fired, princess.

24:43.417 --> 24:44.625
No...

24:47.625 --> 24:50.875
I need to know
if my policy covers it.

24:50.959 --> 24:53.000
No, my car wasn't involved.

24:53.083 --> 24:58.125
It was my neighbor's car...
but the egg was mine.

24:58.250 --> 25:01.041
Aha. Well, can I speak
to your supervisor?

25:01.125 --> 25:03.792
Honey? Can you come out here?

25:07.750 --> 25:10.208
What?

25:10.291 --> 25:13.166
Look what I found
stashed in the boys' playhouse.

25:21.792 --> 25:24.417
Please tell me
that's not a purple wall clock.

25:27.291 --> 25:30.917
Pack your bags, we're moving.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.208
<i>Discouraged over losing her job,</i>

26:14.291 --> 26:20.542
<i>Gabrielle decided a makeover would be</i>
<i>the perfect cure for her depression.</i>

26:20.625 --> 26:24.542
<i>It was after finding a moisturizer</i>
<i>she couldn't afford</i>

26:24.625 --> 26:27.625
<i>that it finally occurred to Gabrielle...</i>

26:30.625 --> 26:34.000
<i>...perhaps it was her pride</i>
<i>that needed a makeover.</i>

26:36.917 --> 26:39.959
Excuse me, miss?

26:40.083 --> 26:45.917
- You forgot to give me my receipt.
- Right. Here.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.125
Here we go. Thank you. Come again.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.375
Mrs. Solis?

27:04.667 --> 27:06.333
Oh, God...

27:06.417 --> 27:07.959
Hello.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.041
Hello, Yao Lin.

27:11.125 --> 27:14.291
- How are you?
- Good. Very good.

27:14.375 --> 27:19.041
I wanted to call you. I felt terrible
about how we left things.

27:19.125 --> 27:22.750
- I need lipstick.
- OK, but...

27:22.834 --> 27:24.500
Now.

27:27.417 --> 27:30.000
You must be loving this. Huh?

27:30.083 --> 27:32.667
Having me serve you
must be a dream come true.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.291
Can't complain.

27:35.417 --> 27:39.625
That's the difference between
you and me, Yao Lin, our dreams.

27:39.709 --> 27:41.750
Close your eyes, please.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.333
Thank you.

27:43.417 --> 27:47.750
You see, I dreamed of pulling myself up
from nothing, and I did.

27:47.834 --> 27:51.375
I dreamed about the things I wanted,
and I got them all:

27:51.458 --> 27:55.959
a high powered career, a handsome
husband, an extravagant house.

27:58.208 --> 28:01.667
This is just a blip on the radar for me.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.667
Because now I know what I'm capable of.

28:04.792 --> 28:08.667
And if I did it once, I can do it again.

28:08.792 --> 28:12.667
I'm never really down, Yao Lin.
Even when it looks like I am.

28:13.792 --> 28:17.083
So, enjoy this moment,
enjoy your dream.

28:17.166 --> 28:22.166
'Cause for you,
it doesn't get any better than this.

28:22.750 --> 28:26.000
There. Don't you look beautiful?

28:45.667 --> 28:47.625
Right this way.

28:47.709 --> 28:50.750
- Everything OK?
- This dress is just riding up.

28:50.834 --> 28:54.667
If I walk any faster it'll be
Happy Valentine's Day for everyone.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.709
Especially me.

28:57.834 --> 28:59.875
Thank you.

29:02.917 --> 29:05.959
Excuse me, miss?

29:12.375 --> 29:16.125
I'm so sorry! Is everyone OK?

29:16.208 --> 29:20.000
Thank you.
Thank you, so much.

29:25.417 --> 29:29.166
- Ma'am, your napkin.
- Don't even think about it.

29:41.542 --> 29:44.709
It's so wonderful,
what you wrote. Thank you.

29:48.458 --> 29:55.500
OK, I'm not gonna be any type of company
until I get something off of my chest.

29:55.583 --> 29:59.458
Do you remember when you...
said that you wanted to have kids?

30:01.542 --> 30:03.583
Here's the thing.

30:05.583 --> 30:09.333
I don't think
I'm ready to have another baby.

30:09.417 --> 30:12.583
I think we need
to have a serious conversation.

30:14.375 --> 30:16.125
Sure.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.125
- I'm not going over there.
- Yes, you are.

30:23.250 --> 30:29.542
No. I can deal with the humiliation
of returning everything the boys stole,

30:29.625 --> 30:32.625
but please,
don't make me apologize to her.

30:32.709 --> 30:34.792
This is being a good neighbor.

30:34.875 --> 30:39.291
Finding ways of getting along instead
of, you know, hurling an egg at them.

30:41.166 --> 30:44.667
Why don't we just go, “we're even",
and start from scratch?

30:44.750 --> 30:48.125
If the "pleasant human being"
argument doesn't fly,

30:48.208 --> 30:50.250
we'll try self-preservation.

30:50.375 --> 30:54.125
She wakes up, the house is on fire.
You don't want her to call 911?

30:54.208 --> 30:58.125
If our house catches fire, I guarantee
she's the one that started it.

30:58.250 --> 31:01.542
OK, my point is, the day will come
when we need her help.

31:01.625 --> 31:05.834
And I don't want her not to help us
just because of some silly feud.

31:07.750 --> 31:11.750
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Thank you.

31:11.834 --> 31:14.875
Whoever came up with
"Love Thy Neighbor"

31:14.959 --> 31:17.583
lived nowhere near
Karen McCluskey.

31:17.667 --> 31:23.083
Yes, well, on Valentine's Day,
the only motto that really matters is,

31:23.166 --> 31:29.667
- "Love Thy Husband".
- Really? I recall no such motto.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.291
I understand
why you would want to have kids,

31:38.417 --> 31:40.917
but that chapter in my life
is just closed.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.125
I don't think I can go back there.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.500
And so, you know,
given the way I feel

31:45.625 --> 31:48.458
and given the way I think you feel...

31:51.083 --> 31:56.875
Oh, God. You're not taking this well.
Oh, I was afraid of this.

32:02.041 --> 32:03.166
What?

32:04.417 --> 32:06.375
I gotta go.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.500
What?

32:08.875 --> 32:10.959
I'm sorry.

32:12.208 --> 32:17.083
You're leaving without trying
to talk me into having your baby?

32:17.208 --> 32:20.083
How do you know I wouldn't cave?
I always cave. I...

32:22.291 --> 32:23.750
Mike?

32:37.583 --> 32:40.333
- Good night.
- Night.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.083
So, how does this...
domination thing work?

33:00.875 --> 33:03.166
So there's nothing to be afraid of.

33:03.250 --> 33:07.041
We'll be constructing simple scenarios
and acting them out.

33:07.125 --> 33:10.875
So, it's like we're in a little play.

33:10.959 --> 33:12.375
Sort of.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.500
If things get too rough,
we'll have a control word.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.959
If one of us says it,
the other backs off.

33:18.041 --> 33:21.333
OK. So what's our control word?

33:21.417 --> 33:24.875
Well, lately
I've been using "Philadelphia".

33:28.125 --> 33:29.875
What's wrong?

33:29.959 --> 33:33.875
Aunt Fern lives in Philadelphia.
I don't want to think about her

33:33.959 --> 33:36.709
while I'm spanking you
with a leather strap.

33:36.792 --> 33:40.792
OK. Fine. You pick a control word.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.125
How about "Boise"?

33:45.750 --> 33:48.875
- "Boise"?
- What's the matter with "Boise"?

33:50.125 --> 33:53.208
We're gonna be
doing psychological role-playing,

33:53.291 --> 33:56.208
and a funny word like "Boise"
will ruin the mood.

33:56.291 --> 33:59.417
We need something that sounds serious.

34:01.458 --> 34:04.333
How about "Palestine"?

34:06.333 --> 34:08.834
"Boise" will be just fine.

34:10.333 --> 34:13.458
So, I guess we should get started.

34:15.333 --> 34:18.166
What do you want me to do?

34:19.333 --> 34:21.500
Handcuff me to the bed.

34:21.625 --> 34:25.000
Bree, you are not gonna regret
taking this journey with me.

34:25.083 --> 34:29.834
This is gonna infuse our marriage
with more passion than you can imagine.

34:30.709 --> 34:33.792
You just have to trust me.

34:33.875 --> 34:35.333
I do.

34:38.208 --> 34:42.500
Would you mind if I ran these
through the dishwasher once?

34:43.709 --> 34:44.959
Sure.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.667
You can see him
as soon as the doctor's finished.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.875
OK. Thanks.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.625
Can you believe that story?

34:56.709 --> 34:59.500
No way that gunshot wound
was self-inflicted.

34:59.583 --> 35:02.083
And he can't remember
who stitched him up.

35:02.208 --> 35:06.583
Well, the police are on their way
to talk to him. Let them sort it out.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.125
Sorry about ruining dinner.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.291
Please, I'm just glad you're OK.

35:37.333 --> 35:40.875
So, you shot yourself?

35:43.458 --> 35:45.750
Pretty lame, huh?

35:47.041 --> 35:52.625
Yeah, I was cleaning my automatic
and was too embarrassed to tell you.

35:53.542 --> 35:57.417
Well, I could see why you would be.

35:57.542 --> 35:59.583
I know it sounds crazy, I just...

35:59.667 --> 36:02.542
I couldn't let myself ruin
your Valentine's Day.

36:03.875 --> 36:07.583
But I heard what you said
at the restaurant.

36:07.667 --> 36:11.125
- About not wanting kids.
- We don't have to talk about that.

36:11.208 --> 36:13.291
No, Susan.

36:14.375 --> 36:18.667
I just want to be with you
above everything else.

36:18.792 --> 36:20.875
If that means not being a dad...

36:23.417 --> 36:26.625
I may be stupid enough
to shoot myself,

36:27.959 --> 36:31.125
but I'm not stupid enough
to walk away from you.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.667
You know that, right?

36:36.792 --> 36:38.458
Yeah.

36:42.834 --> 36:47.458
I'm gonna go outside
and let you rest for a while.

36:52.041 --> 36:56.792
Thanks...
for being so understanding.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.583
Ma'am.

37:12.375 --> 37:16.959
Mr. Delfino? I'm Officer Russell,
this is Officer Walters.

37:17.041 --> 37:19.333
We'd like to
ask you a few questions.

37:40.834 --> 37:43.458
What do you want?

37:43.542 --> 37:46.709
The boys have something
they'd like to say to you.

37:52.125 --> 37:57.125
I have some tea heating on the stove.
Perhaps you'd better come inside, boys.

38:02.625 --> 38:05.875
What about you, Lynette?
Do you have anything to say?

38:07.417 --> 38:10.792
No. I'll just wait out here.

38:10.875 --> 38:12.917
Suit yourself.

38:22.083 --> 38:25.208
You boys want some peanut brittle?

38:25.291 --> 38:26.917
Go ahead.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.125
Don't get any crumbs on my floor.
Move over.

38:33.875 --> 38:37.333
OK, go ahead.
Make with the apology.

38:39.291 --> 38:41.166
We're sorry.

38:42.208 --> 38:46.834
That's it, huh?
Didn't you know stealing is wrong?

38:47.667 --> 38:50.375
- How old are you anyway?
- We're six.

38:50.458 --> 38:53.000
- And how old are you?
- Five.

38:54.041 --> 38:56.959
Boy, your mother
just pops them out, doesn't she?

38:57.041 --> 38:59.625
How old are you?

38:59.709 --> 39:03.000
- How old do you think?
- 150.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.250
Hurry up and eat your peanut brittle.

39:12.291 --> 39:14.375
Who's that?

39:17.458 --> 39:19.542
That's my little boy.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.917
Where does he live?

39:23.208 --> 39:26.458
- He died when he was 12.
- How come?

39:27.291 --> 39:32.041
He got sick.
He was a little terror like you three.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.083
You would've liked him.

39:39.083 --> 39:41.959
Now, you done with the peanut brittle?

39:42.041 --> 39:43.834
Let's go.

39:47.333 --> 39:50.417
Now, I wanna say something
to you before you go.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.000
What you did was wrong,

39:53.083 --> 39:58.000
but it's nice you got a present
for your Mom for Valentine's Day.

39:59.667 --> 40:02.375
Nobody's ever gonna love you
like your mother.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.083
All right, let's go.

40:08.959 --> 40:10.583
Get the hell out of my house.

40:10.667 --> 40:15.750
<i>In her heart, Lynette knew she would</i>
<i>probably never love her neighbor,</i>

40:15.834 --> 40:22.125
<i>never realizing love was the one thing</i>
<i>she and her neighbor had in common.</i>

40:35.291 --> 40:37.125
- Hi.
- Hey, Lynette.

40:40.709 --> 40:43.041
What's wrong?

40:43.125 --> 40:48.125
My kids have been on a thieving jag.
Stealing stuff from the neighborhood.

40:48.208 --> 40:49.500
I'm so sorry.

40:49.583 --> 40:53.166
I know. They're being punished.
Probably for life.

40:53.250 --> 40:56.750
But I needed you to see something.

40:58.375 --> 41:01.917
They stole it from Mike's garage.
From inside his workbench.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.291
Your Mike.

41:08.875 --> 41:12.792
- So?
- Read the engraving.

41:20.583 --> 41:24.083
- Is that blood?
- I don't know.

41:24.166 --> 41:27.542
What does this mean?

41:28.750 --> 41:29.917
I don't know.

41:40.333 --> 41:44.834
<i>It's impossible to grasp</i>
<i>just how powerful love is.</i>

41:45.792 --> 41:48.875
<i>It can sustain us</i>
<i>through trying times...</i>

41:53.208 --> 41:57.583
<i>...or motivate us</i>
<i>to make extraordinary sacrifices.</i>

42:00.208 --> 42:05.375
<i>It can force decent men</i>
<i>to commit the darkest deeds.</i>

42:06.709 --> 42:13.125
<i>Or compel ordinary women</i>
<i>to search for hidden truths.</i>

42:15.208 --> 42:17.709
<i>And long after we're gone,</i>

42:17.792 --> 42:21.667
<i>love remains,</i>
<i>burned into our memories.</i>

42:25.000 --> 42:27.917
<i>We all search for love.</i>

42:28.000 --> 42:29.709
<i>But some of us,</i>

42:29.834 --> 42:33.417
<i>after we've found it,</i>

42:33.500 --> 42:35.625
<i>wish we hadn't.</i>
