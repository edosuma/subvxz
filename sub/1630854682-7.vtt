WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.635
- Our man krish is hosting an
event for potential new dealers

00:03.637 --> 00:06.038
And we believe
he will be handing out
sample packs of this.

00:06.173 --> 00:09.308
- We'll do a controlled swap,
replace the real drugs

00:09.443 --> 00:11.109
With these lookalikes.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.312
(shutter clicks)
- nathan and I are big noise.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.913
- We need krish
to buy our cover.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.448
Any chance we're going
to meet the prince?

00:16.517 --> 00:19.184
- Nah. Nobody connects
with the prince except for me.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.587
- Help, I can't stop!

00:21.722 --> 00:22.721
(grunting)

00:22.790 --> 00:24.389
- Get on the ground!

00:24.392 --> 00:25.523
Get down!
- Ah!

00:25.559 --> 00:26.725
- Officer, you're making
a mistake!

00:26.860 --> 00:28.093
- Shut your mouth!

00:28.228 --> 00:29.861
- You gonna lodge
a formal complaint against
those assholes?

00:29.897 --> 00:32.264
- The system is... Rotten.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.366
I keep defending it.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.476
- We believe the purple rain
is being transported via

00:44.611 --> 00:45.743
These hazardous waste bags.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.512
- Uh, nathan, could you
just fix the focus on that,

00:47.548 --> 00:49.615
It's a bit blurry.
- No, it's as clear as day, sam.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.884
G-b-h-9-3-4-0-2-x.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.452
You need to get your eyes
checked.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.321
- Nathan and I traced the region
code on the label over there.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.757
- Looks like it came from the
chemistry lab at guelph tech.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.493
- Guelph. Whew, that doesn't
narrow it down much. Holy.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.362
- I'd say it narrows it down
pretty good.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.131
- Yeah.
- There's only one guelph tech.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.832
So, overlooked chemistry nerd

01:07.868 --> 01:09.835
Making and selling
illegal drugs?

01:09.904 --> 01:13.105
- Possibly michel owens.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.440
He's the lab manager in the
chemistry department over there.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.776
- He's got a phd in chemistry,
he has access to the lab.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.345
First one in, last one out,
owns a beautiful home

01:20.347 --> 01:22.046
In guelph and a condo
in yorkville.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.782
Also, he drives a porsche.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.317
- And check this out.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.253
- Whoa.
- Michel owens 10 years ago.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.188
He was the lead singer of
a local cover band

01:30.257 --> 01:32.791
Called fuschia shock.
One guess,

01:32.926 --> 01:34.193
Whose music they were covering.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.662
Yeah, so what
he's been doing is--

01:36.797 --> 01:38.429
- Prince!
- Sorry?

01:39.666 --> 01:43.668
- The band. The man. Prince.
- Yes, sam. It's prince.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.003
- Okay, here's what
I'm thinking.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.539
We take a road trip out
to guelph. Bump the guy,

01:47.541 --> 01:49.474
See what we find.
- That sounds like a great idea.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.877
You all hit guelph, we'll have
another meet with krish,

01:51.879 --> 01:54.012
Pick up the huge
supply of purple rain
we've already paid for,

01:54.081 --> 01:55.880
See if he leads us
to the prince that way.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.350
- Yeah, you keep that big nose
play going, boys.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.752
- It's big noise.
- Yeah.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.488
- Yeah, which is
marginally better.

02:03.557 --> 02:04.622
Uh...

02:05.526 --> 02:06.825
Sam, you good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.493
Just smelling my desk.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.094
But up here...

02:10.131 --> 02:12.830
It's dizzy, so I just,
I'm just gonna stay here
for a second.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.166
- Wait, dizzy?
- Yeah.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.100
- Hold up, how long have
you been feeling this way?

02:16.137 --> 02:18.236
- Wha... Uh... Since I fell
at the rink and I...

02:18.372 --> 02:19.705
But my head still hurts
a tiny bit.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.972
- Whoa, look at me.
- Yeah.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.708
- Okay, sam, your pupils are
different sizes.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.976
We need to get you
to the hospital.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.777
- We're not going to the
hospital, we're going to guelph,

02:25.813 --> 02:27.312
We're going on a road trip.
She can drive,

02:27.314 --> 02:28.814
I'll give her the keys,
I'll be the passenger.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.782
- Sam, come with me.
- That's the thing,
you always drive,

02:30.784 --> 02:32.384
That's the only difference
in the whole thing.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.586
You look amazing in red, don't
get me started on your jeans.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.354
Guys, it's gonna be okay.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.590
(upbeat music)

02:47.334 --> 02:48.800
- I'm a terrible partner.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.401
I'm gonna cancel my trip.
- Oh my god,

02:50.437 --> 02:52.003
Don't cancel your trip,
it's for work.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.338
- I should have known.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.606
I should have been looking
into your eyes,

02:54.741 --> 02:56.341
Why haven't I been looking
into your eyes, sam?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.875
Kelly here was looking
into your eyes

02:57.912 --> 02:59.577
And she's just your colleague.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.147
- Okay, we have your mri result.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.550
You have a concussion.
Likely a grade two.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.918
- I knew it.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.853
- Uh, okay, so what
do I have to do?

03:07.988 --> 03:09.354
- There's different schools
of thought these days

03:09.489 --> 03:10.555
On how to treat them.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.091
Some of us think that blood
flow to the brain

03:13.160 --> 03:16.595
And exercise are crucial
in the early stages of recovery,

03:16.597 --> 03:18.430
You know, keeping your brain
sharp as you transition

03:18.499 --> 03:20.164
Back to normal.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.033
Most doctors would say
to take it easy.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.768
Come back and see me
in a couple of weeks.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.571
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.973
- I'm gonna text judy from
your phone and let her know.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.115
- You just...

03:37.184 --> 03:39.384
Type her password in
and use her phone like that?

03:39.519 --> 03:40.819
- Mm-hmm.
- Ironically,

03:40.821 --> 03:41.887
We have the same password.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.455
Wait, no, no, no,
what are you doing?

03:43.590 --> 03:45.724
Stop. Please don't text judy,
'cause, um,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.993
Elliot's coming home
this weekend, remember?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.328
He's gonna take care of me.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.862
What?
(chuckling)

03:50.898 --> 03:52.598
- Elliot take care of you...

03:52.733 --> 03:54.198
- No, he is gonna
take care of me.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.134
He's probably really excited
to take care of me.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.535
- Hilarious.
- No, he is, because--

03:57.571 --> 03:59.204
- Oh my god.
- This is what sons do,

03:59.206 --> 04:00.405
They take care of their mothers.

04:00.540 --> 04:01.873
He's a man now...

04:01.909 --> 04:03.541
(overlapping chatter)

04:03.543 --> 04:05.710
Stop it, it's not funny.
(laughing)

04:10.517 --> 04:11.883
- Yup, there he is.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.219
- See? Every week,
like clockwork.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.421
And I told him you've been
hassling me about

04:16.423 --> 04:17.555
The purple rain shipment.
- Good.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.691
- You got your work cut out
for you, though.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.992
- Why's that?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.894
- 'cause you're gonna need
to be scary if you want krish

04:22.930 --> 04:24.262
To listen to you.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.764
- We could be scary.

04:26.566 --> 04:27.766
- See this right there?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.202
I got that from a guy named
mulch when I was 17,

04:30.204 --> 04:32.070
I sold him weed
mixed with oregano.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.306
And this? Right there?

04:34.308 --> 04:36.174
That's when I paid my rent
with the money I made

04:36.243 --> 04:37.776
From selling 30 hits of acid

04:37.911 --> 04:39.778
Instead of paying back
my supplier.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.580
You see, dealers are scary
because they aren't afraid
to get violent.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.517
But you two aren't dealers,
you're cops.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.784
And that would be assault.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.486
Anyways, have fun.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.194
- I mean, we don't have to throw
down just to be intimidating.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.196
- Oh, fear of getting your ass
whooped

04:58.265 --> 04:59.998
Is more powerful than getting
your ass whooped.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.333
- Agreed. And if krish happens
to get violent,

05:02.369 --> 05:04.269
Then hey, we can get violent.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.737
- It's self-defence.
- Yeah.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.072
- Alright, follow my lead.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.411
And you're not allowed to do
that de niro face.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.680
(upbeat music)

05:15.749 --> 05:16.548
- Very good.

05:17.617 --> 05:18.950
(indistinct chatter)

05:20.754 --> 05:22.421
(groaning)

05:27.695 --> 05:28.927
- Um...

05:30.431 --> 05:32.297
(clattering)

05:33.067 --> 05:34.432
- Do you have a back door?

05:34.468 --> 05:38.436
- Uh, yeah. Down the hall.
- Cool. I'll be right back.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.782
Boys! Good to see you.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.850
- You're looking sharp.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.352
Listen, listen,
I thought we agreed,

05:54.355 --> 05:55.721
I'll text you when I get
the stuff in.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.923
- Yeah, we did, but uh...
Well, we got a little impatient.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.859
It's been 24 hours.
- Look, guys,

06:00.861 --> 06:02.126
You're gonna get your stuff.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.662
I'm actually on my way
to pick it up today, so,

06:04.732 --> 06:06.665
You're just... You're just gonna
need to chill, alright?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.700
- That's great, 'cause
we promised people a party.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.737
So until we have
our order in hand,

06:12.740 --> 06:14.939
The three of us are gonna
get real cozy.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.074
- Understood.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.613
- Uh, steve called,
he was so worried,

06:21.682 --> 06:23.948
So he asked me to pick up some
stuff and just check on you.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.818
- Yeah, I'm fine, really. Good.
I'm... Good.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.353
- Well, you don't know that.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.221
Because I had a friend
who had a concussion,

06:30.257 --> 06:31.690
It ruined their entire life.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.625
She had to move
into her cousin's basement,

06:33.627 --> 06:34.826
It was--
- her cousin... Yeah.

06:34.828 --> 06:38.029
- Or, you could be like
many, many other people

06:38.165 --> 06:40.765
That got a knock on the head and
just use it as a great excuse

06:40.801 --> 06:42.901
To take a couple of days off
and chill back, lay back.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.236
(gasping)
you can watch drag race.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.571
- Yes!
- No, no, no, no,

06:46.640 --> 06:48.039
You have to avoid...

06:48.041 --> 06:49.508
No tv! No tv!
- What?

06:49.643 --> 06:52.376
- You have to avoid all screens.
Screens are the worst.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.712
- Avoiding it.
- What?!

06:53.847 --> 06:55.313
- You need it to be dark.
- Dark.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.349
- And calm. So, I have your
lunch, I've got your dinner.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.150
I'm gonna take care of it all.
- Okay.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.987
- Okay, I'm gonna send you
this article that's more in line

07:01.989 --> 07:03.721
With what your doctor says
and basically opposite

07:03.757 --> 07:05.123
Of everything you just said,

07:05.192 --> 07:07.725
You know, do the hard stuff,
force yourself back to normal.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.594
Ah, there it is.
- Great, why don't you email me

07:09.729 --> 07:12.197
That article and I will
read it and I will enjoy
reading it, thank you.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.799
- No, no, no. Are you guys
serious right now?

07:14.802 --> 07:17.202
- Yeah... No...
- I'm sorry, kelly,

07:17.337 --> 07:18.703
No offence--
- sent.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.806
- She's gonna go upstairs,
lights out, lie down.

07:21.875 --> 07:22.674
I'll make lunch.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.409
You don't have to worry
about her.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.877
I got it.
- Oh, actually,

07:25.946 --> 07:29.013
You know, I was thinking about
making her lunch, some...

07:30.083 --> 07:32.951
Mm, barbecue ribs, salad,
collard greens,

07:32.953 --> 07:34.419
Mac and cheese
with a little bacon,

07:34.488 --> 07:36.621
You know that good gut health?

07:36.756 --> 07:38.890
So, um, I think I got it from
here, you can leave.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.758
- Oh, you know what?
My dearest friend kelly,

07:40.828 --> 07:42.627
Why don't you go to guelph
for the both of us?

07:42.762 --> 07:45.163
And you, my bossy friend
can cook this delicious food

07:45.232 --> 07:47.232
Because it smells amazing
and I am starving,

07:47.367 --> 07:48.833
And then you can
go back to work.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.869
- Okay, well, somebody has
to stay with you.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.371
At least until elliot gets here.
- I do agree with that.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.674
- Okay, it's gonna be ro
because detectives are more
important than lawyers.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.977
- Wow, you do have
a concussion.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.913
Okay, uh, well, have a good day,
detective.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.181
- If I didn't have a meeting
with super shanks,

08:04.218 --> 08:05.917
I'd take you on.
- Ooh.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.252
- Yeah, so have a great time
in guelph

08:08.288 --> 08:10.054
And you keep me posted.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.657
And I also want you to say hi
to prince for me.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.925
- Oh, will do.
- Okay.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.728
- Take it easy. Mm-hmm!
- Okay, bye. Thank you!

08:16.863 --> 08:18.129
(chuckling)

08:18.165 --> 08:18.997
She's great.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.533
(door opening and closing)

08:21.668 --> 08:24.068
- Hon, I don't know how
to break this to you,

08:24.104 --> 08:26.871
But prince died.
It was really sad.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.406
- Yes, the...

08:28.475 --> 08:30.207
I know the musician is dead,
it's not that,

08:30.244 --> 08:32.210
It's the prince is part
of the drug case.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.613
And ro, what are you doing?
- I'm doing exactly

08:34.615 --> 08:36.280
What you would do,
don't look at me like that.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.651
But you need to go upstairs
and rest, okay?

08:39.786 --> 08:41.686
I'll make you a tray.
It's gonna be good.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.155
Come on.
- Hey.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.523
Thank you.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.093
You're a really good friend.
- Yeah.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.527
- Seriously.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.097
- Hold the railing.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.634
- Oh, this arrived on my desk
last night,

08:56.703 --> 09:00.004
Your official complaint. It's
very clear, it's very formal.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.174
Officers taylor and maccleary,
68th division,

09:03.176 --> 09:05.577
Pulled you over,
drew their guns,

09:05.712 --> 09:08.379
Held you down on the ground
and cuffed you.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.681
That's awful. I'm sorry.

09:11.852 --> 09:15.453
But there's nothing in here
about how you feel.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.390
For one thing, it might help me
to advocate

09:18.525 --> 09:20.858
On your behalf, get these
assholes the maximum

09:20.894 --> 09:21.993
Punishment they deserve.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.729
- What's the point?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.799
The problem is bigger
than these assholes.

09:29.536 --> 09:32.537
And it's funny, I was at
a black sistah circle,

09:32.606 --> 09:36.207
Right before I got pulled over,
and this woman, leticia,

09:36.276 --> 09:40.011
Said that this place
is a rotten tree.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.880
We're the bad apples.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.882
But I don't know how
we get rid of the infection.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.183
(sighs)

09:47.254 --> 09:52.090
- Kelly, this place needs us
here to change,

09:52.159 --> 09:53.758
You and me.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.294
This corner office,
with the view,

09:56.363 --> 09:58.496
Might have come
seven years too late,

09:58.565 --> 10:01.566
But things are shifting.
You think five years ago,

10:01.701 --> 10:04.235
I could have called out
the police board

10:04.237 --> 10:06.570
About how the police unions

10:06.607 --> 10:08.573
Are one of the biggest
impediments to change

10:08.642 --> 10:10.108
And accountability?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.843
Even two years ago they would
have just laughed me

10:11.978 --> 10:13.310
Out of the room. But now?

10:13.347 --> 10:14.745
(chuckles)

10:14.781 --> 10:18.816
And I take some sort of solace
in that progress.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.756
We are here to fight
the good fight.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.060
- Alright, I will channel
my inner sade

10:29.129 --> 10:31.396
And bare my soul.
- Thank you very much.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.597
- Yeah.
- Hey.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.132
Hope I'm not interrupting.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.900
Any news?
- Yeah, I was actually

10:35.902 --> 10:38.603
About to head to your office,
give you an update on sam.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.205
- How is she?
- She has a concussion,

10:41.274 --> 10:44.475
Needed some rest, but she should
be good in a few days.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.944
I was about to head to guelph
anyway to get a lay of the land.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.213
- Well, if sam is not able
to go with you,

10:49.249 --> 10:50.749
I'd like you to take
someone else.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.349
- Who?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.554
- Detective duff!

10:56.590 --> 10:57.855
What up?

10:57.857 --> 10:59.424
- Hey, chase.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.693
- Looking forward to the trip.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.763
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
Me too. Me too.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.098
- May I?
- Uh, may...

11:08.001 --> 11:09.033
(sighing)

11:09.069 --> 11:11.802
Oh... Um...
- I heard about the incident.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.571
Horrible, just...

11:13.640 --> 11:15.806
Horrible. No justice, no peace.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.576
- No. No. Thank you. Okay.
Uh, let's go.

11:18.578 --> 11:21.179
- Oh, I brought some hot pepper
jelly pastries for the road.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.447
- Hot pepper jelly pastries?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.448
- Hot pepper jelly pastries,
yeah.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.316
They're out of control good.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.051
I don't usually indulge,
but these babies

11:27.054 --> 11:28.252
Are really testing
my discipline.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.254
- Uh, that's great. I'm driving.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.424
- Sure.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.934
(upbeat music)

11:44.738 --> 11:45.836
- Come on.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.939
Just relax.
(sighs)

11:48.008 --> 11:49.340
What did ro say,
what did ro say?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.742
You can do this,
you can...

11:50.877 --> 11:52.010
You know what? No, stop.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.479
Just do what kelly said.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.015
I don't care,
it's making me feel sick.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.084
Back to normal,
get back to normal.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.618
Eyes open.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.287
Okay, this... I'm gonna light
my hair on fire.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.489
This is not really...

12:12.899 --> 12:14.265
I can't breathe.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.200
- Oh.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.102
Ah.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.404
Oh.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.643
Oh, fudge, I got hot pepper
jelly in my eye.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.711
Ow.
- What?

12:26.780 --> 12:28.046
- Oh, wow.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.114
Ow, that smarts.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.984
Ah, oh jesus, ow.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.653
Oh, I got it in my other eye.

12:35.689 --> 12:38.055
Oh geez louise. Oh.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.191
- Why don't you use water
to rinse it out or something?

12:40.326 --> 12:41.926
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.661
I... I have contact solution
in my bag somewhere.

12:43.730 --> 12:46.864
Um... I can't see my...
I can't see my bag.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.399
I can't... I can't see.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.234
(groaning)
- here you go.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.836
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Hey, I'm gonna go in

12:51.972 --> 12:53.738
And see if I can get a meeting
with this lab manager

12:53.807 --> 12:55.139
Michel owens, okay?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.408
- Okay, yeah, just let me...
Let me pull myself together here

12:57.410 --> 12:59.077
And I'm... And I'm right
behind you.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.411
- Yeah, you work on that.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.813
- Ow.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.347
Ah.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.716
When I blink is when it stings.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.285
Ah.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.058
(door closing)
- hello?

13:14.861 --> 13:15.760
Elliot?

13:16.530 --> 13:18.996
Oh my god, ah, yes!

13:19.766 --> 13:22.233
Hi. You're home. Oh my god.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.968
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is that my concussion

13:24.004 --> 13:25.436
Or is that actual stubble
on your chin?

13:25.505 --> 13:26.805
- Ah, it's...

13:27.774 --> 13:29.140
I'm growing out my mane.
(laughing)

13:29.209 --> 13:30.674
You like?
- I don't know.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.576
Can I feel it?
Can I touch it? Alri--

13:32.612 --> 13:35.780
Oh, wow.
(laughing)

13:35.782 --> 13:38.049
So, did dad tell you about
my condition?

13:38.184 --> 13:40.518
- Yeah. I'm here with you
for a bit.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.919
- Just a bit?

13:41.988 --> 13:46.124
- Well, I gotta go, um, visit
jackie, actually, in guelph.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.525
She's going to school there.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.193
- Guelph? Is it guelph tech?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.062
She goes to guelph tech?
- Yeah.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.197
- Do you think,
I was wondering...

13:53.767 --> 13:54.999
Just a thought...

13:56.102 --> 13:57.434
Is she involved in
the drug scene up there?

13:58.705 --> 14:01.673
- I guess insensitivity's
a symptom of your concussion?

14:01.808 --> 14:04.475
- I am supposed to be
in guelph on a drug case

14:04.477 --> 14:06.511
So I just thought, ooh, ooh.
- Dude.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.547
So there's drugs in guelph,
a town of 100,000 people,

14:10.584 --> 14:12.617
Jackie happens to be
one of those people

14:12.686 --> 14:14.352
So she must be involved
in the drugs?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.621
I mean, come on, she's actually
doing really good.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.522
I'm doing good.
- Mm-hmm.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.492
- How about we just leave it
alone this time?

14:21.494 --> 14:22.927
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm gonna go make you

14:22.996 --> 14:25.329
A cup of tea.
- Sure. Thank you.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.439
(indistinct chatter)

14:35.775 --> 14:37.608
(knocking)

14:53.026 --> 14:54.591
- Can I help you with something?

14:54.628 --> 14:57.361
- Ah, yes, uh,
detective kelly duff.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.463
- Celine levy,
work in the admin office.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.265
- Yeah, I'm looking for
michel owens,

15:01.268 --> 15:03.067
The lab manager for
the chemistry department.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.803
- You and me both.
Students are up in arms,

15:05.839 --> 15:07.939
Nobody's been able to access
the lab for the last few days.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.273
- Really?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.310
Is he on vacation or something?
- Well, he shouldn't be.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.713
The last time he signed into
the lab was two nights ago
at midnight.

15:15.782 --> 15:19.751
He turned the place upside down,
got the janitor fired

15:19.886 --> 15:22.420
And locked up at three in
the morning, left with the key.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.855
Nobody's seen him since.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.622
- Why'd he get
the janitor fired?

15:25.659 --> 15:28.292
- Insubordination, apparently.
- Hmm.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.228
Do you have this janitor's
contact info?

15:31.230 --> 15:33.564
I'd like to get in touch,
maybe they know

15:33.566 --> 15:35.233
What's going on or how to
track him down.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.701
- Come with me.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.109
(groaning)

15:45.178 --> 15:46.276
- What?

15:47.180 --> 15:49.981
Ugh.
Where's that fool at?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.116
(groaning)

15:54.421 --> 15:57.054
Whoa, okay, uh,
dustin, are you okay?

15:57.123 --> 15:59.723
- No. No. Not at all.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.460
I tried to put saline in my eyes
and I accidentally

16:02.595 --> 16:03.861
Brought my contact cleaner
I guess--

16:03.930 --> 16:05.195
- Okay, do you have the keys?

16:05.231 --> 16:08.199
- Peroxide, I shot peroxide
directly into my eyes.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.735
And I think I have a scratched
cornea because it really stings.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.670
- Chase, I need the keys,
where are they?

16:13.707 --> 16:15.206
Look, you could sit out there,
there's a bench.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.408
- No, because I can't find them!
Right? Because...

16:17.410 --> 16:19.143
You want to know why?
I can't see at all.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.079
Oh, boy.
- Alright, look.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.814
- Oh, I'm suffering some serious
ouchies today, kelly.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.483
- I bet. Look, I gotta talk to
this janitor about michel owens.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.486
I will text you where I'm going.
Alright, you look for the keys

16:28.555 --> 16:30.621
And get your hands
out of your face, alright?

16:30.623 --> 16:32.690
Your natural tears
will wash away whatever's
going on in there.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.358
And then, you drive
to meet me there.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.960
- Yes. That sounds good.
Got it, kelly.

16:37.964 --> 16:38.963
Kelly?

16:39.032 --> 16:40.597
(phone chiming)

16:43.903 --> 16:45.302
Uh...

16:45.338 --> 16:48.372
Hey, sealey, what should
you do if you get peroxide
in your eyes?

16:49.242 --> 16:50.908
<i>- I found this on the web.</i>

16:50.944 --> 16:52.443
- Sealey, I can't...
I can't see, right?

16:52.578 --> 16:54.445
So I can't read. I need you
to read it for me.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.646
<i> - I'm not sure I understand.</i>

16:55.648 --> 16:57.515
<i> Is there something else</i>
<i> I can help you with?</i>

16:57.584 --> 16:59.517
- Yes! How can I fix my eyes,
please?!

16:59.652 --> 17:01.118
<i> - I found this on the web.</i>

17:01.254 --> 17:02.319
(groaning)

17:02.389 --> 17:04.021
- Sealey! Kiss my ass!

17:06.859 --> 17:08.525
- Still no word from the prince.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.995
- This is so typical
of the prince,

17:11.130 --> 17:12.996
But I'm gonna get a call back
any minute, okay?

17:13.033 --> 17:15.600
- We can't be here all day, man.
What time is it?

17:15.735 --> 17:17.001
- I don't know.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.036
From this side, it looks like
it's about 5 o'clock.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.904
On this side, I'm not so sure.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.809
- Funny, guys. Real funny.
- Oh, you think something's--

17:24.878 --> 17:26.143
- Krish!

17:26.179 --> 17:27.211
I've been looking for ya.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.682
- Let's get in the whip, krish.
I gotta take a load off.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.953
- I, uh, managed to break down
that little sample of yours.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.956
Turns out purple rain is nothing
but caffeine and sugar.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.092
- No, that's...
That's not my product.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.894
- You cheated me.
- Get in the car, krish.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.731
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.367
Now, we don't have to do this.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.877
(grunting)

18:07.386 --> 18:08.519
- Watch out!

18:10.523 --> 18:12.055
(grunting)

18:14.494 --> 18:16.260
(groaning)

18:26.339 --> 18:28.071
- I didn't cheat you, okay?
It was the prince!

18:28.108 --> 18:29.473
It was the prince, I promise!

18:29.476 --> 18:30.707
- Who's the prince?!

18:30.743 --> 18:32.609
- It's the guy that controls
the chemistry lab

18:32.645 --> 18:34.679
At guelph tech, okay?
His name is michel owens.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.981
Michel owens, that's all I know.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.615
(grunting)

18:40.219 --> 18:41.486
- Hey! Get off of him!

18:43.289 --> 18:44.688
Alright, alright, alright.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.658
You got the information.
We don't need the knives, right?

18:49.095 --> 18:50.928
- No, I'm still gonna wreck you
and then just head to guelph.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.397
(grunting)

18:54.200 --> 18:56.234
(groaning)

19:00.173 --> 19:01.572
- Freeze! Back up!
- Hey, hey, hey!

19:01.608 --> 19:04.474
Gtpd, you're under arrest!
- Drop the knives, now!

19:05.511 --> 19:07.611
- Get up against the wall!
- Hurry up!

19:08.781 --> 19:10.348
- Maccleary!

19:10.350 --> 19:12.015
- You guys are cops?

19:12.051 --> 19:13.918
- Fooled you, didn't I?
Turn around.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.653
Turn around!

19:15.655 --> 19:16.721
Yeah!

19:19.592 --> 19:21.259
- There's no more big noise.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.328
Naz arrested krish who confirmed
that michel is the prince.

19:24.364 --> 19:27.131
- No, I can't hear you,
I got low bars.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.067
Damn, this is a lot further
than I thought.

19:30.103 --> 19:32.669
- Okay, listen, I spoke to naz,
can you hear me?

19:32.705 --> 19:34.004
Hello?

19:35.208 --> 19:36.140
- What are you doing?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.675
- This is just off kelly's
advice,

19:37.744 --> 19:39.276
I'm leaning into the discomfort,
it's really helping me.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.745
Hello, I can't hear you.
What did you say?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.947
- I'm just gonna turn that off.
- No, honey, don't do that

19:42.949 --> 19:44.348
Because it's really helping me,
so I'm just gonna

19:44.417 --> 19:46.083
Turn that back on. What?
- How is it helping--

19:46.085 --> 19:47.951
- Wait, wait, wait. Sam,
sam, you're breaking up.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.954
- Hello? What did you say?

19:49.956 --> 19:52.756
Listen, kel, hey, could you
just repeat that for me, please?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.358
Repeat that for me.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.361
- The last time michel was seen
he fired the custodian

19:57.496 --> 19:59.330
And now I'm trying to figure out
what happened that night.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.998
- Okay... No, no, no.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.334
Fired who?

20:03.336 --> 20:05.569
Kel, he fired who?
Who did he fire?

20:05.572 --> 20:06.604
- What?!

20:06.739 --> 20:08.572
Hello?
- Hello!

20:09.576 --> 20:11.575
(sighing)

20:12.779 --> 20:14.044
- Hi.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.379
You look really great today.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.416
Are you good? I'm great. So when
are you gonna go see jackie?

20:18.551 --> 20:19.583
- I'm going right now.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.585
- Perfect. I'm gonna go
with you.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.886
- No.
- Yeah.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.387
- What do you mean?
- We're just gonna

20:23.456 --> 20:25.256
Have like a road trip--
- no, no, no.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.058
No road trip!
- It's gonna be so much fun!

20:27.060 --> 20:29.092
Oh my god! Beep, beep!
That's the horn.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.101
(soft music)

20:43.610 --> 20:45.042
(sighs)

21:04.096 --> 21:05.095
- Hi.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.631
Hi. Can I help you?
- Hi. Yes.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.967
I'm so sorry to disturb you.
I'm detective kelly duff

21:10.102 --> 21:12.035
From the greater toronto police
department.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.904
I was wondering if I can ask
you a few questions

21:13.906 --> 21:14.938
About michel owens.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.774
- Yeah.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.043
Sure. Yeah.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.411
You wanna come in?
- Is that okay?

21:22.048 --> 21:23.514
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.783
- Just leave that open,
please.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.851
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.254
(ringing)

21:30.323 --> 21:32.523
Oh, my... My dad installed
that when I was a kid.

21:32.658 --> 21:33.924
Because I used to sleepwalk.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.694
Yeah, here, um.
- Ah, yeah, thanks.

21:38.798 --> 21:43.000
- I'm uh, just sorting
through some bills here.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.938
Stressful on any given day,
but it's especially

21:48.074 --> 21:50.407
Freaking me out a couple of days
after randomly getting fired.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.676
(sighs)
- yeah, I heard about that.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.679
- Yeah. Michel owens.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.281
What do you want to know
about him?

22:05.291 --> 22:06.757
- Hey, I'll be right back.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.461
(mysterious music)

22:15.702 --> 22:17.434
(sighs)

22:21.541 --> 22:23.707
(line ringing)

22:23.743 --> 22:25.776
<i> - Hey, it's kelly duff.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

22:28.314 --> 22:30.147
(phone vibrating)

22:36.723 --> 22:38.488
(sighs)

22:41.361 --> 22:43.493
(indistinct chatter)

22:49.168 --> 22:50.468
(soft music)

22:52.004 --> 22:53.069
- Well now.

22:55.675 --> 22:56.540
- Hey now.

22:57.610 --> 22:58.842
- Hi.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.044
- Hi.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.214
- It took you long enough.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.283
- Yeah.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.586
Plus, I brought my mom.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.624
- That would be really funny.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.560
- Yeah. Um, except I did.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.761
- Jackie!

23:18.364 --> 23:19.630
Hi!

23:20.566 --> 23:21.731
Oh my gosh!

23:21.768 --> 23:23.834
What are you doing here?
I know.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.636
Studying!
- My mom!

23:26.672 --> 23:28.405
- How are you?
- Yeah.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.673
(chuckling)

23:30.877 --> 23:32.776
- So michel owens fired you?

23:32.812 --> 23:34.377
- Yeah, right in the middle
of a meltdown.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.913
- What was
the meltdown about?

23:36.048 --> 23:38.382
- Oh, that I shouldn't be there
when he's working,

23:38.517 --> 23:40.584
But I'm not cleaning enough.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.185
And he doesn't want anyone
touching his stuff.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.921
He's done it before
to other staff,

23:43.990 --> 23:45.923
I just happened to be
his target that day.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.325
- Did you ever see anything
strange going on in his lab?

23:49.328 --> 23:51.595
- I'm a custodian,
detective duff,

23:51.730 --> 23:53.197
I see strange stuff
all the time.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.466
- Right, right.
- I'm basically invisible.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.735
- I mean, I heard you've been
working there for a few years

23:57.870 --> 23:59.737
So it must have been hard
to keep your head down

23:59.739 --> 24:02.139
And ignore it all.
- Hard? Yeah, yeah,

24:02.274 --> 24:03.874
That's an understatement.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.677
- So--
- and like, he knows

24:06.746 --> 24:09.079
What my situation is, it's...
- Uh-huh.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.716
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, please,

24:12.852 --> 24:16.786
Go right ahead. Sometimes
you just need to let it all out.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.388
Please.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.494
- Okay. Yeah. He knows
I'm hanging onto my dad's farm

24:23.563 --> 24:26.029
By a thread and I need
every cent I can make,

24:26.065 --> 24:27.498
But he doesn't care.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.366
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter to him.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.469
And he, you know,
inevitably...

24:33.573 --> 24:35.439
They forget about
the little guy, like my dad.

24:35.574 --> 24:38.175
My dad was so brilliant,
he was so brilliant.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.977
He was always racing
into the future

24:39.979 --> 24:41.845
And he was making these plans.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.715
But he had adhd and
he was super scattered

24:44.850 --> 24:47.718
And he went to the doctor about
it and he tried to get testing,

24:47.853 --> 24:51.455
But they couldn't diagnose him
because testing wasn't covered
for adults.

24:51.457 --> 24:54.458
So he just self-medicated
with booze,

24:54.527 --> 24:57.461
And then he died driving drunk
a year ago.

24:57.530 --> 25:02.465
And I see how all of these
stuck-up guelph tech students

25:02.502 --> 25:05.269
Look at me while
I'm mopping the floor.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.103
And they judge me.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.206
But they don't know me.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.276
Nobody does.

25:14.914 --> 25:18.616
I'm... Sorry. I'm sorry,
sometimes I just get

25:18.618 --> 25:20.417
A little bit carried away.

25:20.419 --> 25:21.818
- Oh, no, no, no, you're good,
you're good.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.287
I said, "let it all out."

25:23.356 --> 25:24.554
Um...

25:25.558 --> 25:27.024
Hey, do you mind if I use
your restroom?

25:27.093 --> 25:29.360
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's just
down the hall.

25:29.495 --> 25:31.127
- Thanks.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.137
(mysterious music)

26:05.064 --> 26:06.530
(sighs)

26:06.532 --> 26:07.897
(ringing)

26:11.337 --> 26:12.603
(ringing)

26:18.744 --> 26:21.077
Tuesday, what are you doing?
- I'm not dumb, alright?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.679
I know when someone's
being fake with me.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.281
- No!
- I'm done with all this, okay?

26:24.350 --> 26:26.416
- No, no, no, Tuesday!
Come back here!

26:26.452 --> 26:27.517
Tuesday!

26:31.290 --> 26:33.691
Oh, sh...
Come on!

26:33.693 --> 26:35.025
Ugh!

26:35.494 --> 26:36.360
(grunting)

26:47.340 --> 26:48.371
Come on, come on!

26:50.976 --> 26:52.443
(breathing heavily)

26:52.578 --> 26:53.877
Ugh!

26:58.184 --> 27:00.517
Ugh, come on. Come on, come on.

27:00.553 --> 27:02.218
(groaning)

27:03.122 --> 27:05.255
(panting)

27:05.324 --> 27:07.424
- Crown attorneys have
a no-tolerance policy

27:07.559 --> 27:09.793
For drug dealers who sell
a synthetic cathinone

27:09.928 --> 27:11.128
Made from legal ingredients

27:11.130 --> 27:13.230
And think they're too smart
for the system.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.398
And overdose numbers
are high, so.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.869
- Judges do like nice, educated
boys with no previous charges.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.739
- Not when some
of those overdoses have
resulted in death.

27:21.741 --> 27:24.341
- And your client's
the only one selling this
product on the market.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.044
But that's okay,
you're a tough guy.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.378
You can handle yourself.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.280
We'll just have to see what
the gangs on the inside

27:30.316 --> 27:31.614
Think of that.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.216
- Fine.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.653
We'll deal. Go ahead, krish.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.222
Tell them what you know.

27:39.625 --> 27:42.092
- I first heard about purple
rain at a house party in guelph.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.695
I know that students
were using it to micro-dose,

27:44.764 --> 27:46.563
To help them with school,
but if they snorted it,

27:46.632 --> 27:48.766
It's a pretty cool psychedelic.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.902
Got a message from
the manufacturer, the prince,

27:52.037 --> 27:54.104
And they asked me if I wanted
to get into business with them.

27:54.106 --> 27:54.971
(knocking)

27:55.007 --> 27:56.272
- Come.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.943
- Sorry for interrupting,
but we've got michel owens
in custody.

28:00.079 --> 28:03.180
Arrested him at the island
airport about to fly to muskoka.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.481
He's in holding.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.519
- This is ridiculous. You have
no reason to be holding me.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.387
I told you I've done
nothing wrong!

28:11.390 --> 28:12.656
- Detective sergeant
nathan greene.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.057
- Detective taai nazeer.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.194
- And you are dr. Michel owens,
currently employed

28:17.196 --> 28:19.262
As chemistry lab manager
at guelph tech.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.432
- I don't know, you tell me.
- You've been identified

28:21.567 --> 28:23.833
As the maker of purple rain.
- What?

28:23.869 --> 28:25.769
Are you talking about
my prince cover band?

28:25.904 --> 28:29.206
'cause that was ten years ago
and we were bad,

28:29.208 --> 28:31.875
But it's certainly not illegal.
- I'm talking about purple rain

28:32.010 --> 28:34.010
The synthetic drug that
you've been manufacturing

28:34.046 --> 28:35.612
And selling out of your
workplace.

28:35.681 --> 28:38.548
- I'm not making drugs,
I'm not selling drugs.

28:39.785 --> 28:42.786
Am I good at my job? No,
I have little to no patience,

28:42.822 --> 28:44.687
But I am not making drugs.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.825
Have you talked to Tuesday?
- Who's Tuesday?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.494
- The janitor I just had fired
after I caught them

28:50.563 --> 28:52.095
After hours working late

28:52.164 --> 28:54.164
Cooking shit up in my lab
and lying about it.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.432
(soft music)

28:57.002 --> 29:00.303
- Kelly, it's confirmed,
michel is not the prince.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.305
Where are you?

29:02.341 --> 29:04.607
The second that you get
a signal, you have to call me.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.052
Hey.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.987
So, elliot tells me that
you really turned things around.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.388
You're halfway through
your first year.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.457
- Mom. Are you okay?

29:20.592 --> 29:23.093
- How did you straighten
out your study habits,
just discipline?

29:23.095 --> 29:24.694
- Yeah, just discipline.

29:25.598 --> 29:26.796
Why?

29:26.832 --> 29:28.665
- Have you heard of a new drug?
It's called purple rain,

29:28.701 --> 29:30.134
It's really popular at schools
right now.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.368
- Oh my god. Mom.
Are you kidding me?

29:33.706 --> 29:36.340
Didn't we talk about this?
She's not involved in it, okay?

29:36.342 --> 29:38.074
I don't know why
that's so hard to believe.

29:38.076 --> 29:39.008
Right?

29:39.678 --> 29:41.077
- I do purple rain.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.347
I've been micro-dosing it,
but it's been good.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.016
It's been really good,
actually.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.152
Like, I've never really
been able to focus before,

29:48.287 --> 29:49.953
But I can finally apply myself
and actually--

29:50.088 --> 29:52.556
- Yeah, I need you to tell me
where you got it from right now.

29:52.558 --> 29:53.756
- Why would I do that?

29:53.793 --> 29:55.959
- Because naz confirmed
that someone's posing

29:56.094 --> 29:57.828
As a lab manager.
Because I can't find kelly

29:57.963 --> 29:59.162
And I think she's
in real trouble.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.897
Because your micro-dosing
might help you ace a test,

30:00.966 --> 30:02.432
But it's killing kids
who snort it.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.967
Because elliot knows you,
he says you're a good person

30:04.102 --> 30:05.501
And I trust him.

30:10.543 --> 30:14.111
- There's a custodian on campus
named Tuesday who makes it.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.680
I have a friend named raya
who knows where they live.

30:18.751 --> 30:20.416
- You're gonna call raya
and get an address.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.252
And you're gonna drive me
there right now.

30:22.387 --> 30:23.654
- Yup.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.527
(soft music)

30:40.039 --> 30:41.271
(brakes squeaking)

30:54.653 --> 30:55.719
- Kelly!

30:55.854 --> 30:57.554
(banging on door)

30:57.623 --> 30:59.222
Kelly!

30:59.225 --> 31:00.991
It's okay, we're gonna
get you out of there.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.492
(mumbling)

31:03.362 --> 31:05.728
Do you smell that? It's gas.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.505
(banging on door)
kel! Can we get in there?

31:16.575 --> 31:18.041
- I mean, there's bars
on the window.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.476
- Kelly!

31:21.146 --> 31:22.546
Kelly!

31:24.416 --> 31:26.383
- Oh my god, this place
is a fire hazard.

31:27.319 --> 31:30.854
- Kel!
- Hey. Hey.

31:30.856 --> 31:32.923
If we're smelling gas
and kelly's passing out,

31:32.925 --> 31:34.991
That means there's enough gas
in the air for any amount

31:35.127 --> 31:36.860
Of electrical current
to make this place explode.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.396
I'm studying chemistry right
now, I'm doing chemical bonds.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.331
- Hey!

31:41.466 --> 31:43.000
Hey, kel, can you hear me?

31:43.135 --> 31:46.737
Listen. Don't turn any switches
on or off, okay?

31:46.872 --> 31:48.338
You can't trigger
the electrical current.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.775
- There's a motion sensor light
wired into the ceiling.

31:51.844 --> 31:55.679
- Oh my god. Oh my god! Okay!
That's okay!

31:55.681 --> 31:57.080
Okay, don't panic!

31:57.082 --> 31:59.282
Nobody panic! It's okay!
Don't panic!

31:59.351 --> 32:00.616
Stay there, we'll get you out!

32:04.623 --> 32:05.822
(grunting)

32:05.824 --> 32:06.690
Get back!

32:06.825 --> 32:08.491
Step back, step back, step back.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.830
- Hey, hey, hey.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.535
- Ah!

32:26.244 --> 32:27.210
- Ooh.

32:30.048 --> 32:31.181
(coughing)
- oh.

32:33.719 --> 32:34.817
- Okay.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.253
I see it.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.556
She can crawl out.
- No, she can't.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.258
She'll trigger the sensor,
this whole place will blow up.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.528
- I think we should wait
for the fire department

32:44.663 --> 32:46.396
Or enbright or something.
- When is that happening?

32:46.432 --> 32:47.731
Is your phone working?

32:47.733 --> 32:49.266
Because mine's not.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.203
Do you remember the motion
sensor that was in our driveway

32:53.272 --> 32:54.737
Outside your window?
- Yeah.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.773
- When I used to sneak
in and out of the house,

32:56.809 --> 32:59.409
I would crawl on stomach
to avoid setting it off
and waking you up.

32:59.544 --> 33:00.810
And it worked.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.247
I mean, that sensor looks like
it's pointed outwards,

33:04.383 --> 33:06.082
Not down.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.584
So if she can crawl out,

33:07.653 --> 33:09.853
We can get her out without
triggering it. Trust me!

33:09.855 --> 33:12.155
- I love that you're saying
"trust me" after you admitted
all of that.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.757
(exclaiming)
okay.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.425
Kel.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.627
I need you to crawl
towards us, okay?

33:17.629 --> 33:19.028
(soft grunt)

33:20.199 --> 33:24.000
Come on, kelly. You can do it.

33:25.303 --> 33:26.436
Okay, she can't.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.305
I'm gonna go in after her.

33:30.009 --> 33:30.974
- Careful!
- Yeah.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.924
Alright, get behind me.

33:49.762 --> 33:50.893
Listen to me.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.664
You're gonna pull us out,
okay, elliot?

33:55.467 --> 33:56.866
You're gonna pull us out.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.471
Give me slack, give me slack,
give me slack.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.077
- Watch your elbows. Elbows!

34:08.347 --> 34:09.479
Get lower!

34:11.349 --> 34:12.682
Feet!

34:14.520 --> 34:15.919
- Okay, I'm with you.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.655
It's okay. It's okay.

34:20.659 --> 34:24.294
Okay, here we go.
Okay. Okay, elliot, pull.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.628
Come on.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.898
Hold on, not so fast,
hold on. Hold on.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.833
Come on. You can do it, kel.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.234
Come on, pull, pull, pull,
elliot.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.435
Pull, pull, pull.
Grab her hands!

34:32.504 --> 34:33.903
Come on, come on!

34:34.039 --> 34:35.305
Grab her hands!

34:35.307 --> 34:36.840
(grunting)
grab her hands!

34:36.975 --> 34:38.308
Go, go, go.

34:38.377 --> 34:39.642
(grunting)

34:40.378 --> 34:41.944
(panting)

34:45.584 --> 34:46.850
Are you okay?

34:46.852 --> 34:48.718
- Watch it!
- Are you okay?

34:48.720 --> 34:51.854
Here, here... Come on.
- Alright, just breathe.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.789
(panting)

34:59.932 --> 35:01.430
- You're good, you're good,
you're good.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.003
(rhythmic music)

35:31.163 --> 35:32.696
(grunting)

35:33.398 --> 35:34.330
(panting)

35:35.567 --> 35:38.434
- You okay? Is everybody okay?
- Jackie, jackie, run.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.303
Get a signal, call for help.
- Okay.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.005
- You okay?

35:53.718 --> 35:56.186
- Tuesday. Yo!

35:56.321 --> 35:57.787
Tuesday!

35:57.823 --> 35:59.856
- It doesn't matter
how much you promise them.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.458
Yes, I know they're scary,

36:02.494 --> 36:05.395
But I can only carry
as much as I can carry,

36:05.464 --> 36:08.731
And that cop is here
and there's been some kind
of an explosion

36:08.767 --> 36:11.267
And I gotta go right now, okay?

36:11.403 --> 36:12.869
- Tuesday! What are you doing?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.137
- No, no, get out of my way.

36:16.441 --> 36:17.374
- Tuesday.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.441
Stop.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.677
- No.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.280
(grunting)

36:27.285 --> 36:29.419
- Oh, gosh, whew!

36:29.421 --> 36:31.154
That was a lot,
maybe a bit too much.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.156
Are you okay? I think I'm doing
okay, what was I saying?

36:33.291 --> 36:35.825
I was saying, uh... Right, yeah.
You are under arrest.

36:35.894 --> 36:36.959
Okay. Let's go.

36:43.101 --> 36:45.434
(mysterious music)

36:54.045 --> 36:55.911
- What are you looking for?
- Huh?

36:55.948 --> 36:58.047
What?
- What are you looking for?

36:59.918 --> 37:02.252
- I'm looking for purple rain

37:02.254 --> 37:03.920
Because if they arrest Tuesday

37:03.922 --> 37:05.855
There's not gonna be anymore
and I need to get through finals

37:05.991 --> 37:07.724
And I need to get a scholarship
for next year

37:07.859 --> 37:09.826
And I just need a little bit.
- You don't need that

37:09.828 --> 37:11.294
To get through finals!
- I do.

37:11.429 --> 37:13.129
I do need it.
- Why don't...

37:14.166 --> 37:15.131
If you're having problems
concentrating,

37:15.200 --> 37:16.332
There's plenty of other stuff
you can do.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.803
Seriously, jackie,
you are already brilliant,

37:19.805 --> 37:21.604
You don't need that stuff.

37:30.682 --> 37:34.818
- Alright, Tuesday. I need you
to talk to me right now.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.487
Did krish put you up
to all this?

37:38.556 --> 37:39.756
Hmm?

37:39.891 --> 37:41.223
- You know what?

37:42.494 --> 37:44.561
I didn't make purple rain
with the intention of dealing.

37:46.064 --> 37:49.332
I just started reading
about adhd and ways to focus.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.502
And then, I started playing
with chemicals in the lab
after hours.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.108
I'm like my old man, you know?

37:58.110 --> 38:00.510
I'm pretty sure I have
adhd too

38:00.645 --> 38:02.312
And I was just trying
to help people.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.779
- Yeah.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.249
Were you trying to help
the people who overdosed

38:06.384 --> 38:07.750
And died?

38:08.453 --> 38:09.585
Hmm?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.588
Were you trying to help
them too?

38:20.865 --> 38:21.997
- Come on.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.407
(sighs)

38:43.155 --> 38:44.821
- Wow.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.698
(indistinct chatter)

39:02.640 --> 39:04.374
- Kelly, there you are.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.976
Boy, what a rigmarole, huh?

39:07.012 --> 39:09.312
I finally got in touch
with watts, he brought up

39:09.447 --> 39:11.047
Some eye drops and this patch.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.182
Saved the day, he did.

39:12.317 --> 39:14.650
- Oh he did, did he?
Thank god for watts.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.018
- Uh-huh.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.189
- Thank you, officer.

39:20.559 --> 39:23.860
Now I hope you're a fan
of anne murray.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.863
But if not, doesn't change
anything.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.998
I'm not really in the business
of letting

39:29.000 --> 39:31.401
Arrested drug dealers
choose my playlist.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.671
But I will warn you,
I love to sing along.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.406
Do you know any lyrics
to anne murray songs?

39:36.475 --> 39:40.143
- No, I have no idea...
- Oh, well, first timer,

39:40.278 --> 39:42.078
You're in for a treat.
We got snowbird...

39:42.213 --> 39:43.880
(indistinct chatter)

39:43.949 --> 39:47.116
- Oh, geez, wait, I can't drive,
I have a concussion.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.019
- Well I can't either,
I just almost died of
propane inhalation.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.086
- Oh, right.

39:51.123 --> 39:53.289
- I just smoked a bunch
of weed, so.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.258
- Same.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.826
You wanna just go back
to my residence?

39:56.862 --> 39:58.594
- Yeah.
(clears throat)

39:58.663 --> 40:01.363
- Okay, see ya'.
- Call you tomorrow.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.731
- It was a treat.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.968
- Sadly, I also cannot drive.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.003
I'm still blind in one eye.
- Oh god, put it down.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.414
- Sam, you home?

40:20.185 --> 40:22.852
Ro! How's it going?
- Hi.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.055
I was trying to find this recipe
that I sent sam,

40:26.057 --> 40:27.991
I was gonna make it for her
as a surprise.

40:27.993 --> 40:31.427
- Oh, is she sleeping?
- No. No, she's not home.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.529
I tried to get her to stay
in bed, but I think

40:33.565 --> 40:34.997
That kelly was pressuring her
to go to work.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.065
(sighing)

40:36.067 --> 40:37.867
I wasn't expecting you
to be home

40:38.002 --> 40:41.136
So I just let myself in again,
but if you don't need me to cook

40:41.173 --> 40:43.873
I should probably go because
I have a ton of work to do.

40:44.008 --> 40:46.275
- You go. I'll order pizza.
Sam eats so much pizza

40:46.344 --> 40:48.678
It puts her in a coma.
She'll be in bed for a week.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.146
(laughing)
- oh, I know.

40:55.287 --> 40:56.285
(door closing)

41:07.032 --> 41:09.899
- Huh. Interesting.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.904
(indistinct chatter)

41:15.907 --> 41:18.440
- Thank you for saving my life.
Again.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.744
Man, I can rely on you
for everything.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.182
- Not everything.

41:30.222 --> 41:32.688
I heard what happened
the night of the roller rink.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.658
Those two uniformed cops.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.696
That's horrible.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.800
I can't imagine. And I know
that I can't imagine.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.803
And I completely understand
why you didn't want to talk
to me about it.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.673
- Well, it was hard to talk
about, sam.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.409
- It's just a reality
I'll never have to endure

41:53.545 --> 41:55.278
Whereas like shanks and nathan,
they would

41:55.413 --> 41:57.079
Understand more easily.
- Yeah, well...

41:58.283 --> 42:00.749
Even shanks had to pull it out
of me this morning.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.621
You know, it's less words
for nathan and shanks

42:04.623 --> 42:06.623
To understand what I'm feeling,
but it doesn't mean

42:06.758 --> 42:08.157
That I can't talk to you too.

42:10.295 --> 42:14.297
And best friends
don't need to be everything
all the time, right?

42:15.433 --> 42:19.101
Like, you might not always be
my first stop

42:19.170 --> 42:22.171
When I'm dealing
with a racist asshole.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.173
And I may not be your first stop
when you need someone

42:24.242 --> 42:26.175
To buy you groceries
and make you lunch

42:26.211 --> 42:28.511
And be all hovery-dovery
and worried about you

42:28.580 --> 42:31.180
Because you bumped
your little head, you lean
on ro for that one.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.815
- I don't know,
I remember you being like,

42:32.817 --> 42:34.717
"oh, would you like collard
greens? I love you so much,

42:34.753 --> 42:37.319
You're my favourite person.
How about some ribs, please?
I love you,

42:37.355 --> 42:39.389
I want to hold you."
- I did not say "I love you,

42:39.524 --> 42:41.123
I want to hold you,"
I was bluffing,

42:41.159 --> 42:43.293
She was trying to show me up.
Besides, you gotta be hella sick

42:43.428 --> 42:45.194
For me to be up in the kitchen

42:45.263 --> 42:46.996
All day acting like
I'm your bitch.

42:47.032 --> 42:48.798
- Yeah, I guess we'll just
leave that to ro.

42:48.933 --> 42:49.932
- Yeah.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.468
- Tough day.

42:53.505 --> 42:56.472
- I had a thought,
it goes a bit like this.

42:56.474 --> 42:59.609
I go to your house,
you get out the ribs,

42:59.744 --> 43:02.078
Get out some collard greens,
I'll sit back in the couch,

43:02.080 --> 43:03.946
You just whip that up for me.
What do you think?

43:05.917 --> 43:07.416
- Keep dreaming.

43:09.153 --> 43:11.287
(soft music)

43:41.119 --> 43:42.317
Subtitling: Difuze
