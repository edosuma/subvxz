00:01.410 --> 00:02.786
Previously on Queen Sugar...

00:02.830 --> 00:04.127
You thinking of
hiring a parolee?

00:04.170 --> 00:05.740
Can't afford
to get this wrong.

00:05.790 --> 00:06.996
Some folks
said the same thing
about you,

00:07.040 --> 00:07.790
and they were
dead wrong.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.910
Ithought
you owned the land.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.666
Why are farmers who
are leasing your land

00:11.720 --> 00:14.336
-being kicked off?
-You're part of this, too, now.

00:14.390 --> 00:15.709
I shouldn't haye
to ask permISSIon

00:15.760 --> 00:18.502
to spend time
with my son, our son.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.846
-Hi. I'm Trinh.
-When you find nice girl

00:20.890 --> 00:22.471
for you and little boy,
you come over.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.930
I make dinner
for you one night.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.891
How many of you
want to be farmers?

00:25.940 --> 00:27.601
Maybe you are
a good teacher.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.777
You have a sister, Micah.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.389
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.906

Thank you.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.486
Bye now.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.020
So what were
your favorite?

00:39.080 --> 00:40.945
Well, my second favorite
was the otters.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.706
-Yeah.
-They were so cute and funny.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.035
-So cute and funny.
-Super cute.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.911
But my first favorite...

00:45.960 --> 00:47.370
-Yeah?
-definitely the sharks.

00:47.420 --> 00:49.035
Those are
my favorite, too!

00:49.090 --> 00:50.955
-Yeah? They were?
-Those are my favorite, too.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.750
-They were? Seriously? Oh.
-Seriously.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.291
Aunt Vi and Uncle Hollywood
are gonna be so jealous.

00:55.340 --> 00:56.716
They're gonna be
so jealous.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.170
You can tell_ 'em
about It tonight.

00:58.220 --> 01:00.051
-Okay.
-Hand me your backpack first.

01:01.350 --> 01:02.339
Here you go.

01:02.390 --> 01:03.345
Thank you, my love.

01:03.390 --> 01:04.880
Let's get inside.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.306
You all in?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.475
-Here. Take this.
-I'm in.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.355
What?

01:15.400 --> 01:17.618
When are you
coming back home?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.157
We talked about this.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.248
I have my own home now.

01:24.790 --> 01:29.454
Okay, but when you
and Pop get married,

01:29.500 --> 01:31.991
you're gonna
come home, right?

01:34.880 --> 01:35.926
Put your seat belt on.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.631
Okay.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.379
Dreams never die

01:46.440 --> 01:48.761
Take flight
As the world turns

01:48.810 --> 01:50.471
Dreams never die

01:50.520 --> 01:52.431
Take flight
As the world turns

01:52.480 --> 01:55.233
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

01:56.900 --> 01:58.481
Dreams never die

02:04.040 --> 02:06.861
Keep the colors
In the lines

02:08.790 --> 02:11.918
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

02:11.960 --> 02:14.588
Y'all can
leave them tools
by the shed.

02:14.630 --> 02:16.257
I got it.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.676
-Hey, man.
-Yeah, man.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.926
-See you tomorrow.
-Thank you.

02:18.970 --> 02:20.380
-Appreciate you.
-For sure.

02:20.430 --> 02:22.807
-All right, Remy.
-All right, Benny.

02:22.850 --> 02:24.135
Ralph, thanks for
letting my students

02:24.180 --> 02:25.511
come out this week, man.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.016
It's all good.
Glad to hear it.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.630
You have no idea
how good it is

02:28.690 --> 02:30.646
for them to be able
to see a young farmer

02:30.690 --> 02:32.976
who owns his own land
and runs hIs own farm,

02:33.020 --> 02:37.389
and the fact that you
got all 800 acres
planted is...

02:37.440 --> 02:39.988
[cell phone buzzing]

02:40.030 --> 02:41.065
Wow.

02:43.780 --> 02:46.908
Yeah, I gotta deal
with this real quick.

02:46.950 --> 02:47.996
You good?

02:48.040 --> 02:49.496
Yeah, I'm straight.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.933
Feel like I'm looking
at a Gordon Parks photo.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.517
All weekI been here,
all I seen is this,

03:12.560 --> 03:15.017
keyboards and coffee,
keyboards and coffee.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.607
When's the last time
you got some sleep, gIrl?

03:17.650 --> 03:20.733
Sleep? Been working
on my proposal.

03:20.780 --> 03:23.237
Just turned it in,
thank you.

03:25.660 --> 03:29.198
"Untitled
by Nova Bordelon."

03:29.250 --> 03:30.365
Still working
on that part.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.241
[chuckles] Well,

03:32.290 --> 03:34.451
I'll still be
the first in line
at the bookstore.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.292
Expecting greatness.

03:37.340 --> 03:39.331
First chapter came
pouring out of me,
you know,

03:39.380 --> 03:42.042
sitting out here
with all this.

03:42.090 --> 03:43.830
It's like Daddy's
speaking to me.

03:44.930 --> 03:46.340
I bet he is.

03:46.390 --> 03:49.097
Damn, Nova, what you
still doing here?

03:49.140 --> 03:51.267
Need to get home
and get in that shower.

03:51.310 --> 03:52.720
You trying
to get rid of me?

03:52.770 --> 03:54.556
If that's gonna
get you off my porch

03:54.610 --> 03:57.010
and out my fridge
and getting these
dishes dirty,

03:57.070 --> 03:59.061
then, yeah, I am.

03:59.110 --> 04:01.237
I think I got
another place for you
to get some relaxation.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.486
Oh, yeah? What you got?

04:09.290 --> 04:13.704
[laughs]
I think something died
in there, Hollywood.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.320
Yeah, I'm going
through the salvage
yard tomorrow,

04:15.380 --> 04:16.950
get the rest
of the parts,

04:17.000 --> 04:18.376
have this bad boy
up and running
for you.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.375
Aunt Vi!
Uncle Holleood!

04:19.420 --> 04:20.967
Hey,you!

04:21.010 --> 04:23.717
[Hollywood] Hey.
Look what the cat drug in.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.388
-[Vi laughs]
-We went to the aquarium today.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.715
You did?

04:27.760 --> 04:29.250
Saw the biggest
shark ever.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.880
He was bigger
than you.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.306
Hey, that's
all right with me,

04:32.350 --> 04:34.056
as long as he stays
in that tank.

04:34.100 --> 04:37.103
Yeah, well, uh,
I want to hear
all about it.

04:37.150 --> 04:38.606
Come on. Let's go
in the house

04:38.650 --> 04:39.810
-and get you cleaned up.
-Miss Violet.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.232
And what about a whale?
Did you see a whale?

04:46.280 --> 04:49.443
_ There were
stingrays and manatees,
even a huge jellyfish.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.445
Bye, baby.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.787
Have fun tonight.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.126
They can't
Play the same...

04:57.170 --> 04:58.785
Hey, uh,
you got anything

04:58.840 --> 05:00.125
that doesn't
say, "organic,"
on the label?

05:00.170 --> 05:01.910
[laughs]
Probably not.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.871
Yeah, I seen
the first season,
like, three times.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.081
Oh, yeah. The best part
is when they storm the frat.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.630
Yeah, but unlike
Dear White People,

05:07.680 --> 05:09.295
our BSU sucks, so...

05:09.350 --> 05:10.806
You guys have
a Black Student Union?

05:10.850 --> 05:12.761
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm. Ever since Ferguson.

05:12.810 --> 05:14.471
Yeah, but
the BSU just wants

05:14.520 --> 05:16.397
to write letters.
That's it.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.431
Like, we out here
doing this, 'cause
no one else will.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.640
-Right.
-That's all right.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.146
We gonna
wake people up.

05:21.190 --> 05:24.148
So we gotta
figure out
what's next.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.658
We should do
a black brunch
in New Orleans,

05:26.700 --> 05:28.907
-one of them fancy hotels.
-True.

05:28.950 --> 05:30.861
Or a bougie
country club.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.992
White folks lose
their minds over that.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.280
No, no, no.
Y'all want to see

05:34.330 --> 05:35.490
white folks
being ignorant,

05:35.540 --> 05:36.495
we should go
to Sweetbay.

05:36.540 --> 05:37.916
What's Sweetbay?

05:37.960 --> 05:39.621
Oh, it's this
crazy-ass plantation

05:39.670 --> 05:40.989
that they
call, you know,
a "historic site."

05:41.050 --> 05:42.620
Hey, uh, you got milk?

05:42.670 --> 05:44.331
Yeah, there should be
almond milk in there.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.870
I mean regular milk.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.047
-[door opens]
-[Charley] Micah!

05:49.470 --> 05:50.596
Oh.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.176
Hey.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.676
Hello.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.632
Yeah, Mom, this is
KJ, Asha, and Malik.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.725
What's up?

05:59.060 --> 06:00.550
Can I talk to you
for a second?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.100
Yeah, sure.

06:02.150 --> 06:03.686
-Ooh.
-Shut up.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.441
Ah, and this is Ant.

06:06.490 --> 06:10.312
Oh, um, ma'am, you don't
drink regular milk?

06:11.620 --> 06:13.485
Uh, well, almond milk

06:13.540 --> 06:15.906
is good for
your digestive system.

06:15.950 --> 06:18.327
-It's low in fat.
-Uh, yes, ma'am.

06:18.370 --> 06:20.497
Well, you know,
it takes one
whole gallon of water

06:20.540 --> 06:22.371
to grow one almond,
which would be cool

06:22.420 --> 06:24.160
if California
wasn't the biggest grower
of almonds,

06:24.210 --> 06:26.258
on account
of their drought and all.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.665
Just food for thought.

06:29.010 --> 06:31.251
By the way,
your house is dope.

06:33.180 --> 06:36.058
I'm gonna make sure
everything is clean,
so don't worry.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.886
Mm-hmm.
Where's Keke?

06:37.940 --> 06:39.225
Ah, some
drill team thing.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.147
So who are these guys?

06:42.190 --> 06:45.068
My friends from school.

06:45.110 --> 06:46.816
Do you remember
from the game?

06:46.860 --> 06:49.192
[friends talking
indistinctly]

06:49.240 --> 06:51.447
All right,
but it's late,

06:51.490 --> 06:53.367
so give it
a few minutes,

06:53.410 --> 06:55.230
and then everyone
should be leaving.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.111
-[cell phone ringtone]
-It's your father.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.320
Don't--

06:59.370 --> 07:00.997
Um, I'm busy.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.338
Just tell him
I'm busy right now, so...

07:03.380 --> 07:04.415
Hey, Davis.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.792
Sure. We can talk.
What's got--

07:10.260 --> 07:11.545
In person?

07:11.590 --> 07:13.842
Micah, can you
ask your friend

07:13.890 --> 07:16.097
to get his shoes
off my coffee table?

07:16.140 --> 07:19.553
I've got a bunch
of teenagers eating
on my furniture.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.057
Uh, how's Monday?

07:22.100 --> 07:23.601
Tomorrow? Yeah.

07:24.940 --> 07:27.226
Yep. We'll see you then.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.896
[Khanh] Welcome
to your first
Vietnamese crawfish boil.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.770
-[speaking Vietnamese]
-If you're hungry,

07:31.820 --> 07:33.526
there's spring rolls
in the dining room.

07:33.570 --> 07:34.616
Appreciate it.

07:34.660 --> 07:35.979
These are
for you.

07:36.030 --> 07:37.827
-For me? Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

07:37.870 --> 07:40.247
-[speaking Vietnamese]
-Thank you for having me.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.576
[scoffs]
Yo, check this out.

07:43.670 --> 07:44.785
[speaking Vietnamese]

07:44.840 --> 07:46.239
Not ready yet.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.619
-Go get spring rolls.
-All right.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.160
Spring rolls
in the dining room.

07:49.210 --> 07:50.871
-Okay, okay. [laughs]
-Let me show you.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.047
Lots of food.
Look. All this food.

07:53.090 --> 07:54.170
All right.

07:54.220 --> 07:56.040
[speaking Vietnamese]

07:56.100 --> 07:57.499
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.596
Here, just a sec.
You can dig in.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.517
All right.

08:12.570 --> 08:13.810
It's different.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.067
You ever
done this before?

08:16.120 --> 08:18.611
[laughs] I--

08:18.660 --> 08:20.742
I need
a little demonstration.

08:20.790 --> 08:22.155
All right.

08:22.210 --> 08:27.079
So you wanna soften
the rice paper

08:27.130 --> 08:30.258
in water like that.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.915
Dip it in there?

08:31.970 --> 08:33.961
-Mm-hmm. Yep.
-Just like that?

08:34.010 --> 08:34.965
-Word.
-Your turn.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.716
Got a plate?

08:36.760 --> 08:37.715
Go ahead.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.842
Mm-hmm.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.057
All right,
then you can add in
whatever you want.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.647
I like a little bit
of everything.

08:46.690 --> 08:49.011
Right, I'm gonna grab
this shrimp.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.062
Little bit of that.
Ooh. Man.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.021
[laughs] My bad.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.322
Roll it up
like a burrito. No?

08:59.370 --> 09:01.031
I don't really
roll burritos at all.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.866
[both laugh]

09:02.910 --> 09:03.990
I think I got it.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.860
And voil.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.706
I'm trying.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.705
-[laughs]
-Should I try it?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.250
[laughs]

09:13.300 --> 09:14.619
Oh, my God.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.329
Here. _
You can have mine,

09:16.390 --> 09:17.926
'cause that one's
probably gonna
fall apart.

09:17.970 --> 09:19.597
Told you. I actually did
a pretty good job.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.710
-Blue would like this.
-For sure.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.227
-Yeah. That's good.
-Uh, when we were kids,

09:24.270 --> 09:26.135
we used to race
to see who could fit

09:26.190 --> 09:27.680
the most in without it
falling apart.

09:27.730 --> 09:30.688
[laughs]

09:41.990 --> 09:46.609
My grandfather
got his whole family

09:46.670 --> 09:50.709
on the boats before he
was killed in Vietnam,

09:50.750 --> 09:55.460
and my uncle got sick
in a Thai refugee camp.

09:55.510 --> 09:59.048
He and my dad made it
to New Orleans just
before he passed away.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.670
That's wild.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.472
Yeah.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.121
So how you like
your new job?

10:31.540 --> 10:34.452
Really tough bosses.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.081
Already got me
working on a Saturday.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.916
I say you strike.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.291
You want to join me
on my one-woman
protest, then?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.137
-I'|| hold a sign or something.
-Oh, okay. [laughs]

10:42.180 --> 10:44.136
Dinner's ready!

10:44.180 --> 10:46.091
Ooh. [speaking
Vietnamese]

10:46.140 --> 10:47.550
Ah, that smells good,
Ms. Phan.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.760
I don't need to--

10:48.810 --> 10:50.095
Ralph,
did you roll that?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.856
-Yeah, I tried.
-Very good.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.310
I don't need
to teach you

10:53.360 --> 10:54.679
how to_ eat
crawfish,
too, right?

10:54.730 --> 10:56.357
I might show you
a thing or two.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.641
-Come on. I got it.
-Oh, my gosh.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.736
[overlapping chatter
in Vietnamese]

11:11.040 --> 11:15.909
All right, mushroom steak
and sauted squash.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.676
Dig in, Blue.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.295
Mmm.
[laughs]

11:24.350 --> 11:26.250
Eh, I'm glad
you like it, baby.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.130
Okay, I'm gonna grab
some corn bread

11:28.180 --> 11:30.762
made from _rice flour
and qulnoa.

11:30.810 --> 11:34.553
So no corn or bread
in the corn bread, then?

11:36.320 --> 11:37.685
I'm just playing, baby.

11:39.610 --> 11:40.770
Are you okay, Vi?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.691
Yeah. It'sjust, uh...

11:45.740 --> 11:48.038
this new dosage
they got me on,

11:48.080 --> 11:49.866
I keep getting
lightheaded. [laughs]

11:55.000 --> 11:56.490
Come on, Blue.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.869
Look, it tastes real good.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.968
Now watch here.
See? See? Look.

12:06.180 --> 12:08.512
[laughing]

12:10.350 --> 12:12.090
I'm not eating it.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.246
You good?

12:33.290 --> 12:35.622
Hey, man.

12:35.670 --> 12:38.662
Something's come up,
and I need a place
to crash tonight.

12:38.710 --> 12:40.041
Think I can stay here?

12:40.090 --> 12:41.830
I got a kid, bro.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.928
I can't be dealing
with no trouble.

12:43.970 --> 12:45.710
I ain't in trouble.
Look, I swear.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.046
It's just if I go back there,
I might be, you know?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.385
What, you did something?

12:49.430 --> 12:51.216
No, I'm good.
I swear to God.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.919
But just,
where I'm staying at,

12:52.980 --> 12:55.096
it's only a matter of time
before five-O show up

12:55.150 --> 12:56.720
with this new dude
coming around.

12:56.770 --> 12:58.476
I just don't want
to be there when they do.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.772
[sighs]

13:00.820 --> 13:02.105
Please, man.

13:02.150 --> 13:03.526
[sighs]

13:08.620 --> 13:11.498
One night.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.111
But you gotta figure
something else out
for tomorrow, man.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.367
For real.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.819
Come on.

13:20.210 --> 13:21.541
Thanks, man.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.216
I got it.
I got it.

13:35.890 --> 13:37.391
Are we going fishing,

13:37.440 --> 13:39.101
or are you preparing
for the apocalypse?

13:40.440 --> 13:42.317
_ -Here.
-I ain't putting that on.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.271
-[clears throat]
-Look, if we gonna do this,

13:44.320 --> 13:46.527
-we're gonna do this right.
-Listen, my daddy would show up

13:46.570 --> 13:48.777
with a bucket and a rod.
He didn't need all of this.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.367
He had his ways,
and I got mine.

13:50.410 --> 13:52.230
-Oh, the ways?
-Yes, the ways.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.440
And I'm always prepared for
whatever life throws at me,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.365
so this is for you.

13:56.410 --> 13:57.616
Yeah.

13:58.710 --> 14:00.029
-Ah-ah!
-What?

14:00.090 --> 14:01.489
-This stays here.
-I-- [sputters]

14:01.550 --> 14:03.256
Not taking no chances
of this going

14:03.300 --> 14:05.120
into _the water
and getting destroyed,
no, Lord.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.468
I gotta take notes.
Laptop's coming with.

14:08.930 --> 14:10.386
Notes.

14:10.430 --> 14:13.467
I got this for you,
old-school style.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.056
Hit it.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.276
Let's do it.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.149
[Remy]
Come on. Mm-hmm.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.280
Mm-hmm.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.416
All right.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.588
Man, you got your cousin.

14:42.630 --> 14:44.746
Just for a couple
of nights, man.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.466
Yeah. I got you.

14:52.930 --> 14:54.090
Let me know, man.

14:54.140 --> 14:55.550
Bye.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.767
Got some breakfast in here
if you hungry.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.599
Thanks, man.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.946
I appreciate you
letting me crash.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.525
Good for tonight?

15:15.580 --> 15:18.902
It's all good.
Know how it is.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.281
What happened
at your grandma's?

15:23.080 --> 15:26.083
She thought I was
getting in trouble again.

15:26.130 --> 15:28.166
But for real...

15:29.380 --> 15:31.177
I'm glad she
threw me out.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.927
Being back
at hers just brings
stuff up, you know?

15:33.970 --> 15:35.756
Still can't sleep
no more.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.386
And I rolled
around the neighborhood,

15:39.430 --> 15:40.886
and everything's
different.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.812
When you go out,

15:48.860 --> 15:51.442
you ever feel like
you don't belong no more?

15:56.740 --> 15:58.617
At the beginning.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.747
I went
to this restaurant
With my Pops

16:04.790 --> 16:06.451
first week out...

16:09.210 --> 16:11.622
everybody
just staring at me.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.921
Pops looked at me
and said...

16:18.890 --> 16:20.676
"One day at a time."

16:24.940 --> 16:27.010
When I was
In there...

16:28.440 --> 16:30.931
I promised myself
if I ever got out,

16:30.990 --> 16:33.060
I ain't going back.

16:38.950 --> 16:40.656
I feel you.

16:52.510 --> 16:54.671
Oh, thank God.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.676
Mmm. Hey...

16:58.100 --> 17:00.421
after you and
Aunt Vi get married,

17:00.470 --> 17:02.426
are you
gonna have a baby?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.766
Nah. Nah, Blue.

17:04.810 --> 17:07.301
Me and your Aunt Vi,
we ain't having no baby.

17:09.690 --> 17:14.059
Think that's okay if
you don't have a baby.

17:14.110 --> 17:15.520
Oh, yeah?

17:15.570 --> 17:17.026
Is that okay with you,
Your Highness?

17:17.070 --> 17:20.574
-Yeah, that's okay.
-[laughs]

17:20.620 --> 17:23.498
I'll just ask
Mommy and Pop for one
after they get married.

17:28.460 --> 17:29.495
What's wrong?

17:31.500 --> 17:33.718
What's wrong
is you being stingy
with them chicken nuggets.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.000
Give me one.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.460
Hand 'em on over.
Uh-huh.

17:36.510 --> 17:37.750
Cheers to real meat.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.711
Chicken cheer.

17:44.890 --> 17:46.437
You meeting Keke?

17:46.480 --> 17:48.471
Uh, no, my friends
that you met last night.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.774
Well, you can tell them
that I am reconsidering
almond milk.

17:53.150 --> 17:54.606
-I said, "Reconsidering."
-Right.

17:54.650 --> 17:55.730
-Reconsidering.

13 years ago, I, uh...

18:49.250 --> 18:51.206
I had an affair.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.266
Charley,
I have a daughter.

19:06.890 --> 19:09.723
A month ago,
her mother passed away,

19:09.770 --> 19:13.854
and, uh, well,
I decided that, uh...

19:16.940 --> 19:19.238
I'm moving back to LA.
to take care of her.

19:20.530 --> 19:22.270

19:25.330 --> 19:26.695

19:26.740 --> 19:28.196
You had a daughter...

19:29.790 --> 19:32.031
in our city.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.086
When do you hit bottom?

19:42.550 --> 19:44.097
I'm sorry.

19:46.890 --> 19:49.267
[chuckles]

19:49.310 --> 19:51.801
When the press finds out
about this girl...

19:51.850 --> 19:53.181
Tia.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.396
Her name's Tia,
Charley.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.600
She just turned 13.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.311
-Don't you dare.
-Look.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.363
Don't you dare try to use
that poor girl's face.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.691
I know I've
done you wrong,
Charley.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.320
I have.

20:12.330 --> 20:14.787

I promise you that.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.501
I promised Micah.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.881
You told Micah...

20:27.600 --> 20:29.340
before you told me?

20:29.390 --> 20:33.133
You just left him
to deal with it on his own?

20:33.190 --> 20:36.011
-I been trying to call--
-"Trying to call"?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.021

23:44.540 --> 23:46.792
I'm unable to answer
the phone rIght now, so...

23:46.840 --> 23:49.411
This is Nova Bordelon.
I'm not here,
but I'm somewhere.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.256
Drop a note,
and I'll get back at you.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.882
[sobbing]

23:53.930 --> 23:57.002
Deliver me

24:00.850 --> 24:06.811
I been away from the river

24:06.860 --> 24:10.398
River

24:10.440 --> 24:14.695
Deliver me

24:17.490 --> 24:23.451
I been away from the river

24:23.500 --> 24:27.288
Deliver us

24:28.800 --> 24:31.041
[laughing]

24:31.090 --> 24:32.626
In the summer?

24:32.680 --> 24:35.422
Oh, it didn't matter
if it was 110 outside.

24:35.470 --> 24:39.509
She'd say, "You gotta
keep your mind sharp,
but your body sharper."

24:39.560 --> 24:41.266
Cheers to Lorna.

24:41.310 --> 24:43.631
Cheers to Lorna.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.026
Okay, I got one.

24:51.070 --> 24:53.482
When I was in college,
my brother Paul and me,

24:53.530 --> 24:58.479
we had this, uh,
fraternity prank that, uh...

24:58.530 --> 24:59.485
went wrong.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.484
Uh-oh.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.689
[both laugh]

25:01.750 --> 25:03.240
When my mama
heard about it,

25:03.290 --> 25:05.667
she drove through the night
to Houston,

25:05.710 --> 25:07.951
hauled our asses out of bed,
across campus,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.831
woke up the Dean
so we could apologize,

25:09.880 --> 25:13.714
just hollering at our asses
the whole way there.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.796
I think that deserves
two shots.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.592
Hey, two shots.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.255
Frances.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.475
Whoo!

25:23.520 --> 25:25.431
Oww!

25:25.480 --> 25:28.187
Wait, wait.
How old's your brother?

25:28.230 --> 25:29.470
[man] Jacob?

25:29.520 --> 25:31.522
Man, I thought
that was you.

25:31.570 --> 25:33.231
Hey, Trent.
Good to see you, man.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.986
[Trent]
I'm glad I ran into you.

25:35.030 --> 25:36.736
We finished up
that northwest
quadrant early,

25:36.780 --> 25:38.736
so we're gonna start
the southeast on Monday.

25:38.780 --> 25:40.520
That's good news, man.
Why don't y'all
get settled in?

25:40.580 --> 25:42.150
I'll send a round over,
all right?

25:42.200 --> 25:44.156
-Yeah. We'll take it. Ma'am.
-All right.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.162
They're just doing some work
on another one of our mills.

25:53.630 --> 25:57.339
All right, last round.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.210
This one's yours...

25:59.260 --> 26:02.673
if you think Lorna
can top Frances

26:02.720 --> 26:04.551
Oh, easily.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.433
But I want to know
more about this
brother of yours.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.643
How much
other hell-raising
you two doing?

26:10.690 --> 26:12.317
You don't wanna know.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.271
Oh, yeah?

26:14.320 --> 26:15.696
Try me.

26:25.830 --> 26:28.822
Hollow one

26:28.870 --> 26:32.954
With invited tongue

26:34.260 --> 26:35.716
From whence...

26:35.760 --> 26:38.001
Hey, you know,
I read that article, uh,

26:38.050 --> 26:39.836
about the kids
at the game.

26:42.310 --> 26:44.926
I know it ain't exactly
how you wanted it
to turn out,

26:44.970 --> 26:49.009
but I was just gonna
say that you did good
with the kids,

26:49.060 --> 26:51.688
gave them a chance
to have their voices
heard, you know?

26:51.730 --> 26:54.358
Their voices
got twisted by adults
who don't know any better.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.732
They have
so much potential.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.317
Everyone's trying
to shame it and push it down.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.196
That's why
we need them,

27:02.240 --> 27:03.821
and that's why
they need you.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.905
How you're
helping Micah...

27:08.830 --> 27:10.821
Nova,
you're their guide.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.048
[birds chirping]

27:14.090 --> 27:15.296
[bell rings]

27:15.340 --> 27:16.375
Oh, hey.
You got something.

27:16.420 --> 27:17.830
[YEIPS]

27:17.880 --> 27:19.427
Easy. Easy. Easy.
Don't tug.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.755
-[laughing]
-Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.882
Nice and easy.
Keep reeling.

27:22.930 --> 27:25.000
There you go.
There it is.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.056
[clears throat]

27:28.100 --> 27:31.092
I caught that
with plain old worm bait

27:31.150 --> 27:32.299
just like my daddy.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.146
[laughs]

27:34.190 --> 27:35.566
Just like
your daddy.

27:35.610 --> 27:36.816
-[laughs]
-Have mercy.

27:36.860 --> 27:38.179
We gonna eat tonight.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.559
-Yeah, you cooking.
-Uh-huh.

27:39.610 --> 27:41.100
-That's for sure.
-Damn right.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.498
Ernest was so desperate
to impress this girl
from the bayou,

27:48.540 --> 27:50.110
he said he loved fishing,

27:50.160 --> 27:52.378
so on their first date,
sure enough,

27:52.420 --> 27:54.285
your mama
catches five fish.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.739
He said,
in that moment,

27:55.800 --> 27:58.621
he knew he wanted
to marry her.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.256
I don't know.

28:02.300 --> 28:04.348
Sometimes I wonder what
her life would have been like

28:04.390 --> 28:06.346
if she hadn't
have gotten pregnant.

28:09.770 --> 28:12.477
Yeah, but she lived
a good life here.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.353
She made the most
of a life she was talked into.

28:17.820 --> 28:20.311
I don't ever want
to be talked into anything...

28:21.490 --> 28:23.026
not again.

28:23.070 --> 28:27.359
Well, I feel
The peeling

28:27.410 --> 28:32.109
Of half-painted ceilings

28:32.160 --> 28:37.666
Reveal the covering
Of a blank sky

28:37.710 --> 28:39.541
[Malik] Ah,
look at these fools.

28:39.590 --> 28:40.909
This ain't
no amusement park.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.336
-It's a crime scene.
-Exactly.

28:45.470 --> 28:48.257
Say, guys, uh, can't
be sitting on those.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.301
They're 250 years old.

28:50.350 --> 28:51.920
Well, my ancestors
fought for the right

28:51.980 --> 28:53.095
to sit
in this chair,

28:53.140 --> 28:54.846
so I'm _
gonna Sit In It.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.856
Yeah, maybe you should go
to those slave quarters

28:56.900 --> 28:59.061
and tell those kids
to stop climbing all over
the windows.

28:59.110 --> 29:01.317
Yeah, you got people
taking pictures
in shackles,

29:01.360 --> 29:02.645
pretending
they're slaves,

29:02.700 --> 29:03.985
and you mad at me
for sitting

29:04.030 --> 29:05.657
in a chair _
my ancestors bUIlt?

29:07.030 --> 29:08.691
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

29:11.370 --> 29:12.997
Is that right?

29:16.830 --> 29:19.298
Nah, that's cool.
We'll go.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.831
We know who this place
is really for.

29:21.880 --> 29:23.120
Come on.
Let's go.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.107
What you say?
What you say?

29:40.320 --> 29:41.719
Nothing much, man.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.850
You know it's
the weekend, right?

29:43.900 --> 29:46.198
-What you doing here?
-I had time.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.902
Thought I'd get ahead
on some more
soil samples.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.407
Found you
a place to stay yet?

29:52.450 --> 29:54.953
Yeah.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.537
Going by
a friend's house
over on Crane Street.

29:57.580 --> 29:58.990
Come on, man.
Everybody know

29:59.040 --> 30:00.530
what going down
on Crane Street.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.626
Stay out of they business
and mind mine.

30:02.670 --> 30:07.175
Yeah, 'til they business
start messing with
your parole, right?

30:07.220 --> 30:10.098
You ain't
going back there.

30:10.140 --> 30:13.348
Hey, crash here
until you find
something better.

30:15.390 --> 30:17.381
I appreciate it, man.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.761
Ah, you don't even know.

30:21.520 --> 30:26.025
Look, I ain't running
no motel, brah.

30:26.070 --> 30:28.607
Stay here, you gotta
follow my rules.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.651
I got a kid.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.019
You got it.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.696
[chuckles]
Yeah.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.319
[frogs croaking]

30:40.380 --> 30:41.836
[Remy] This is
my favorite part.

30:43.130 --> 30:44.757
Thank you.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.375
[Remy]
Look at that.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.593
You know,
you said before

30:54.640 --> 30:57.268
that you don't
want to get talked
into anything.

30:57.310 --> 31:00.017
You don't seem like
someone who gets
talked into things.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.146
In the past,
whoever I was with,

31:04.190 --> 31:08.445
they wanted something,
a piece of me I didn't have,

31:08.490 --> 31:10.981
wanted to change me
into something that I wasn't.

31:11.030 --> 31:12.270
Mm-hmm.

31:17.370 --> 31:19.156
Well, let me
tell you something.

31:20.830 --> 31:22.912
You deserve
to be with someone

31:22.960 --> 31:24.916
who wants
to be with you...

31:26.170 --> 31:28.297
Nova,

31:28.340 --> 31:29.830
not Nova
the activist,

31:29.880 --> 31:31.381
not Nova
the journalist,

31:31.430 --> 31:35.173
just Nova.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.682
[bottles clink]

32:21.020 --> 32:22.760
Here you go.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.016
Thanks.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.687
Downtown tonight

32:25.730 --> 32:27.516
[laughs]

32:27.570 --> 32:30.778
Saw an old friend,
Someone who...

32:30.820 --> 32:32.856
You gotta
humor me on this.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.948
Oh, no, no.
I, uh--

32:37.990 --> 32:39.946
I'm not much
for dancmg.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.571
_ _I can't sit
listening to this song

32:42.620 --> 32:46.124
next_ to a beautiful woman
Without dancmg to it.

32:46.170 --> 32:48.741
And I caught a spark

32:48.800 --> 32:53.828
In her eyes
Of forgotten desire

32:54.930 --> 32:57.000
-Ohl
-[laughs]

32:57.050 --> 33:00.019
With a word or a touch

33:00.060 --> 33:05.509
I could have
Rekindled the fire

33:05.560 --> 33:08.518
But old flames

33:08.570 --> 33:13.940
Can't hold a candle to you

33:16.490 --> 33:19.277
No one

33:19.330 --> 33:24.950
Can light up my night
Like you do

33:27.790 --> 33:31.294
Flickering embers of love

33:31.340 --> 33:35.674
I've known one or two

33:38.930 --> 33:41.717
But old flames

33:41.770 --> 33:46.685
Can't hold a candle to you

33:55.650 --> 33:58.232
Sometimes at night

33:58.280 --> 34:04.241
I think of old lovers
I've known

34:04.290 --> 34:05.780
See if you
got any game.

34:05.830 --> 34:07.206
-Ah.
-All right.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.490
-[splash]
-You can't even see it.

34:08.540 --> 34:09.871
-All right.
-Did all right.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.706
It went far, though.
That's the--

34:11.750 --> 34:13.206
-That was pretty good.
-Let's see what you got, Malik.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.409
All right, um...

34:14.470 --> 34:16.006
[KJ]
Don't hurt yourself.

34:16.050 --> 34:17.119
[laughter]

34:17.180 --> 34:18.579
[Malik]
Okay. Okay.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.709
-[splash]
-You distracted me!

34:19.760 --> 34:21.000
-Give it up.
-No.

34:21.050 --> 34:22.130
Dude, I play basketball,
man.

34:22.180 --> 34:23.260
[KJ] He won.

34:23.310 --> 34:24.595
All right,
all right.

34:24.640 --> 34:25.971
Hey, yo.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.930
You good, man?

34:31.690 --> 34:33.817
My brother's in there.

34:58.720 --> 35:02.099
They had
to adjust the dosage
for the dizziness,

35:02.140 --> 35:06.554
and they got me, uh,

35:06.600 --> 35:08.977
writing down
my symptoms...

35:10.400 --> 35:12.550
so they can
figure it all out.

35:15.900 --> 35:20.064
Oh, I didn't
think you'd be hungry
after all them burgers.

35:20.110 --> 35:22.066
[laughing]

35:22.120 --> 35:23.610
Mm-hmm.

35:23.660 --> 35:27.039
Your partner in crime
spilled the beans.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.569
What's this?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.336
Cauliflower
mac and cheese.

35:35.670 --> 35:37.410
Baby, I can't be doing

35:37.460 --> 35:41.248
that squash and
mushrooms every day.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.382
Now, Nova's diet might
be all well and good,

35:43.430 --> 35:45.921
but a brother
needs some meat and
some flavor somewhere,

35:45.970 --> 35:47.597
and so do you.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.589
Mm-hmm.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.686
[laughs]

35:51.730 --> 35:52.765
Right?

35:52.810 --> 35:54.107
Oh, that's good.

35:54.150 --> 35:55.105
Uh-huh.

35:55.150 --> 35:56.390
Thank you, baby.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.771
Mm-hmm.

35:57.820 --> 36:00.527
Blue...

36:00.570 --> 36:04.654
we know that you
have a lot of questions
about your dad and me.

36:04.700 --> 36:07.157
Remember how I said
I have a new home?

36:07.200 --> 36:09.077
Are we leaving the farm?

36:09.120 --> 36:11.361
Still be living
at the farm.

36:11.420 --> 36:14.071
Just gonna have
two bedrooms now,

36:14.130 --> 36:16.086
one here and
one at your mama's.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.677
Blue,

36:23.720 --> 36:26.803
we're really, really sorry.

36:33.770 --> 36:36.477
Your dad and I
are not getting married.

36:39.650 --> 36:42.141
We decided we're
just gonna be friends.

36:45.490 --> 36:47.526
But you said, "Forever."

36:48.620 --> 36:51.362
I know.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.742
We're so, so sorry.

36:57.130 --> 36:59.166
[Blue crying]

37:07.300 --> 37:08.346
Listen to me.

37:10.220 --> 37:11.596
Hey, look at me.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.971
I'm so sorry,

37:16.020 --> 37:18.477
breaking
your forever.

37:19.690 --> 37:21.738
I am. Hey.

37:23.610 --> 37:27.114
But me and your mom,
we love you always,

37:27.160 --> 37:29.651
and that ain't ever
gonna change, okay?

37:29.700 --> 37:31.497
May I go to my room?

37:33.790 --> 37:34.916
Yeah.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.176
[door closes]

38:02.610 --> 38:04.646
[music playing inside]

38:14.410 --> 38:16.458
I had a real good time.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.166
It was fun.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.497
I have to get home
to my son.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.747
Yeah. Nah...

38:57.790 --> 38:59.451
I understand.

39:01.330 --> 39:03.628
Uh, you okay to drive?

39:03.670 --> 39:04.625
Yeah.

39:04.670 --> 39:06.501
No, I'm good.

39:07.670 --> 39:09.080
All right.

39:27.150 --> 39:31.905
Don't need this
Like I used to

39:36.040 --> 39:40.659
'Cause I feel blinded,
Blinded by you

39:46.050 --> 39:50.794
Don't need this
Like I used to

39:55.010 --> 40:00.130
'Cause I feel blinded,
Blinded by you

40:05.020 --> 40:09.480
Don't need this
Like I used to

40:13.780 --> 40:19.286
'Cause I feel blinded,
Blinded by you

40:23.960 --> 40:28.499
Don't need this
Like I used to

40:39.980 --> 40:45.008
'Cause I feel blinded,
Blinded by you

40:51.490 --> 40:53.310
Oh, oui, oui.
