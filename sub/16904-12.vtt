00:03.445 --> 00:05.512
It doesn't matter how long
you've lived in New York,

00:05.580 --> 00:07.147
it's still fun to look up

00:07.215 --> 00:10.317
and pretend all the buildings
are giant severed robot penises.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.319
Be quiet, Lemon.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.553
It's happening.

00:19.027 --> 00:20.027
Wow...

00:20.095 --> 00:22.396
Out with G.E.,
in with Kabletown.

00:22.464 --> 00:25.532
It seems like one of us should
sing <i>The Circle Game</i> right now.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.101
30 years at G.E....

00:27.168 --> 00:30.204
Now it's on to phase two.

00:30.272 --> 00:33.173
I'm like Keats' "Stout Cortez,"

00:33.241 --> 00:35.709
staring at the Pacific
with a wild surmise

00:35.777 --> 00:37.878
and daring to imagine what...

00:37.946 --> 00:41.548
New planets might swim
into my ken.

00:41.616 --> 00:44.051
So will we be getting
new employee I.D.s?

00:44.102 --> 00:45.886
'Cause I'd really like
to retake my photo.

00:45.954 --> 00:47.221
Good God, what happened?

00:47.289 --> 00:48.722
I was holding in a "snart,"

00:48.773 --> 00:51.775
and then right
when she took the photo...

00:51.860 --> 00:53.260
Don't you want to know
what a "snart" is?

00:53.311 --> 00:54.594
I can tell you now.
It's 10:00.

00:54.646 --> 00:56.096
10:00 in the morning.

01:01.736 --> 01:11.777
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:17.252 --> 01:19.253
Ugh.

01:19.321 --> 01:21.955
FYI, Tracy's
phoning it in today.

01:22.007 --> 01:22.956
What else is new?

01:23.008 --> 01:24.658
No, mother, literally.

01:24.726 --> 01:27.361
Are you also staying
at this hotel?

01:27.429 --> 01:28.462
Line.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.767
Tracy, we have been
playing this game

01:33.835 --> 01:34.968
for five years now.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.904
- When is it ever gonna stop?
- I don't know.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.273
After I win a bunch
of awards for my movie,

01:39.341 --> 01:40.541
it's not gonna get better.

01:40.608 --> 01:42.209
I don't see how
it could get any worse.

01:42.277 --> 01:43.911
Good question, Liz Lemon.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.546
When you win an Oscar,
it opens up

01:45.613 --> 01:47.181
an elite level
of actor craziness...

01:47.248 --> 01:49.249
throwing telephones
at hotel employees,

01:49.317 --> 01:52.386
speaking to the U.N. about
some messed-up crap in Africa,

01:52.454 --> 01:54.989
and I'm definitely
getting a private island.

01:55.056 --> 01:56.423
You're getting an island?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.892
Every crazy A-lister
owns an island...

01:58.960 --> 02:00.027
Nicholas Cage,

02:00.095 --> 02:02.096
Celine Dion, Charles Widmore.

02:02.163 --> 02:05.566
This is a whole new world
in front of me, L.L.

02:05.633 --> 02:08.369
I'm like Stout Cortez!

02:08.436 --> 02:10.770
He's my gardener.
He's easily amazed.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.523
You have two choices here.

02:12.607 --> 02:14.842
Either you can stay
in your room, like a child,

02:14.909 --> 02:16.977
or you can get out there
and do your job.

02:19.481 --> 02:20.731
Thank you.

02:20.815 --> 02:22.783
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was misleading.

02:22.850 --> 02:24.418
I'm not gonna rehearse.

02:24.486 --> 02:26.820
I'm gonna get a sandwich
and then eat it on the toilet.

02:34.462 --> 02:38.132
- What are you wearing?
- My NBC page dress blues.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.200
I want to look good,
in case I get on camera.

02:40.251 --> 02:41.535
On what camera?

02:41.603 --> 02:42.970
Well, Mrs. Jordan's
reality show

02:43.038 --> 02:45.406
is gonna be following Mr. Jordan
around while he's at work.

02:45.473 --> 02:46.573
- What?
- I know!

02:46.641 --> 02:47.941
Isn't it exciting?

02:48.009 --> 02:49.777
I've never been on TV before.

02:49.844 --> 02:52.112
I hope I photograph okay,

02:52.180 --> 02:54.048
because when I look
into a mirror,

02:54.115 --> 02:55.749
there's just a white haze.

02:55.817 --> 02:58.252
Who told Tracy
he could bring cameras here?

02:58.319 --> 02:59.987
Well, Mr. Donaghy.
Uh, here...

03:00.054 --> 03:01.739
I couldn't put the memo
in your mailbox,

03:01.823 --> 03:03.890
'cause it's full
of unread adoption materials.

03:03.942 --> 03:05.159
Yeah.

03:06.778 --> 03:09.063
Hey.
Are the reality cams here?

03:12.400 --> 03:15.369
Oh, God, Lutz, why?

03:15.437 --> 03:17.504
What?
I don't want tush lines.

03:18.673 --> 03:20.174
Oh!

03:20.241 --> 03:21.708
You know...

03:21.776 --> 03:23.310
I have enough problems
with Tracy.

03:23.378 --> 03:26.146
I don't need cameras following
him around while he's here.

03:26.214 --> 03:28.082
Do you know what pays
for your show, Lemon?

03:28.149 --> 03:30.517
Our product placement with
Sullivan Psychiatric Clinic.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.785
"Sullivan Psychiatric...

03:31.853 --> 03:33.654
You'll drool over
our crazy prices."

03:33.721 --> 03:35.522
Reality TV.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.192
A woman with "hundruplets,"
a live execution,

03:38.259 --> 03:41.361
<i>the real transvestite hoarders</i>
<i>of Orange County Penitentiary.</i>

03:41.429 --> 03:43.163
Ugh, that show is upsetting.

03:43.231 --> 03:44.931
Why does the warden
let Lady Extravaganza

03:44.983 --> 03:46.433
have so many spoons?

03:46.484 --> 03:49.369
Programs like that are
the lifeblood of this industry.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.937
They're cheap, promotable,

03:50.989 --> 03:52.439
and even if they're terrible,

03:52.490 --> 03:55.275
you get a rating and move on
to the next idea.

03:55.326 --> 03:56.460
Everybody wins.

03:56.544 --> 03:57.744
Well, I happen to think

03:57.812 --> 03:59.980
we are in a new golden age
of scripted television.

04:00.048 --> 04:01.315
Shh, shh.

04:01.382 --> 04:02.816
Lemon, it's okay.

04:02.884 --> 04:05.853
As I begin phase two
of my jack attack on Kabletown,

04:05.920 --> 04:07.971
I've been doing some research.

04:08.056 --> 04:10.023
Do you know what the most
successful reality events

04:10.091 --> 04:11.525
of the past five years are?

04:11.593 --> 04:14.294
Celebrity benefits
for natural disasters.

04:14.362 --> 04:16.829
The viewership is huge.

04:16.898 --> 04:18.332
Yes, but those ratings
mean nothing.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.534
All the networks air those
benefits at the same time,

04:20.601 --> 04:21.735
so no one gets an advantage.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.404
True, unless only one network
is carrying it,

04:24.472 --> 04:26.573
because only one network
is ready to broadcast

04:26.641 --> 04:28.509
a benefit on the night
of the disaster.

04:28.576 --> 04:29.710
But that's impossible.

04:29.777 --> 04:31.011
There's not enough time
to put it together.

04:31.079 --> 04:34.314
Unless you've pretaped
the show beforehand

04:34.382 --> 04:38.085
and filmed options for every
possible disaster scenario.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.153
You're going to pretape
a benefit

04:40.205 --> 04:42.089
for a disaster
that hasn't happened yet?

04:42.156 --> 04:44.491
- Yeah.
- That is bad karma, Jack.

04:44.559 --> 04:46.193
I mean, this morning,
I stole a cab

04:46.261 --> 04:47.895
from a pregnant lady
on crutches,

04:47.962 --> 04:49.897
and I am just waiting...

04:49.964 --> 04:52.666
Uh, my goodness, Lemon.

04:52.717 --> 04:54.535
The people affected
will still get money,

04:54.602 --> 04:55.669
but so will NBC.

04:55.737 --> 04:56.737
Everybody wins.

04:56.804 --> 04:58.205
Oh, and I need Jenna to sing.

04:58.273 --> 04:59.439
I'll do it!

04:59.507 --> 05:01.859
But I hate my dress.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.004
All right, listen up,
everybody.

05:07.088 --> 05:08.789
I need ideas from you people

05:08.840 --> 05:10.924
for potential
natural disasters...

05:10.992 --> 05:14.094
Anything that might require
a televised celebrity benefit.

05:14.162 --> 05:15.229
I need something new,

05:15.296 --> 05:17.097
and I need it
by the end of the day,

05:17.165 --> 05:19.700
so...

05:19.768 --> 05:21.869
Let's get to work.

05:23.121 --> 05:25.639
Well, I just finished
a screenplay

05:25.707 --> 05:27.875
where a tidal wave
destroys Washington.

05:27.942 --> 05:30.127
Someone write down tidal wave.
Shut him up.

05:30.195 --> 05:33.013
What about a tornado
that hits a handgun factory,

05:33.081 --> 05:35.249
and it's just spinning around
shooting handguns?

05:35.316 --> 05:37.351
What happens
when the second flood comes,

05:37.419 --> 05:39.420
and you aren't allowed
on reverend Gary's ark?

05:39.487 --> 05:41.121
Especially since
reverend Gary made it clear

05:41.189 --> 05:42.873
the ark is just
for teenage boys.

05:42.957 --> 05:44.625
You know, with global weirding
and everything,

05:44.692 --> 05:46.393
stuff like that
could totally happen here.

05:46.461 --> 05:48.195
There was a cyclone
in Brooklyn last year.

05:48.263 --> 05:51.198
It destroyed two vintage-t-shirt
stores and a banjo.

05:51.266 --> 05:52.466
If something does happen,

05:52.534 --> 05:53.700
it'll probably be
while we're at work.

05:53.768 --> 05:55.169
I mean, this is where we spend
all of our time.

05:55.236 --> 05:56.403
We should have a plan in place.

05:56.471 --> 05:57.921
If we don't, I will freak out

05:58.006 --> 05:59.473
and start
karate-kicking people.

05:59.541 --> 06:01.975
Everyone needs
an emergency plan.

06:02.043 --> 06:04.395
For instance,
right before the ark leaves,

06:04.479 --> 06:06.847
I'm supposed to castrate
reverend Gary.

06:10.985 --> 06:12.986
I see you finally
decided to come to work.

06:13.054 --> 06:13.954
Of course.

06:14.022 --> 06:15.272
I'm just continuing

06:15.356 --> 06:16.957
my consistent
professional behavior.

06:17.025 --> 06:18.826
Let's laugh together, friend.

06:23.865 --> 06:26.467
- What's going on with him?
- First of all, good morning.

06:26.534 --> 06:29.837
And to answer your question,
it's Angie's cameras.

06:29.904 --> 06:31.438
These reality shows
want crazy behavior,

06:31.506 --> 06:32.940
so Tracy's keeping it boring...

06:33.007 --> 06:34.775
Give them nothing
that could make him look bad.

06:34.843 --> 06:36.977
Since when does Tracy care
about looking bad?

06:37.045 --> 06:38.645
Since he got nominated
for an Oscar.

06:38.713 --> 06:40.981
Then once he wins,
it's on to the next level,

06:41.049 --> 06:42.483
which I am not looking
forward to.

06:42.550 --> 06:44.802
That island he wants to buy
is filled with scorpions.

06:44.886 --> 06:46.620
Let's do it again from the top.

06:46.688 --> 06:48.155
I want to get it perfect,

06:48.223 --> 06:50.424
because perfection
is my middle name...

06:50.492 --> 06:52.826
"Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy."

06:58.032 --> 06:59.616
So here's the plan.

06:59.701 --> 07:01.935
If anything happens, we meet
outside under the Atlas statue,

07:01.986 --> 07:03.437
walk to the 59th Street bridge,

07:03.505 --> 07:05.005
and try to get
to my mom's house in Queens.

07:05.073 --> 07:06.006
Okay, good.

07:06.074 --> 07:07.274
We've got a wide skill set

07:07.342 --> 07:08.842
for any
post-apocalyptic scenario.

07:08.910 --> 07:11.178
I'm good at archery
and kind of want to die.

07:11.246 --> 07:13.180
I can use my glasses
to start a fire.

07:13.248 --> 07:15.282
Toofer can get us
through black, gay,

07:15.350 --> 07:17.551
and nerd-controlled
neighborhoods.

07:17.619 --> 07:19.820
Cerie will be some sort of queen
in the new society.

07:19.888 --> 07:22.623
I will do sex with cannibals
as needed.

07:22.690 --> 07:23.891
I can talk to animals.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.125
Well, not talk to 'em...

07:25.193 --> 07:28.011
I can take commands from 'em.

07:28.096 --> 07:30.964
Huh. Lutz... What can he do?

07:31.032 --> 07:33.150
Well, he's slow and a coward.

07:34.536 --> 07:35.903
I'm not useless.

07:35.970 --> 07:37.971
I mean, I've got a car.

07:38.039 --> 07:39.573
Oh, I didn't know that.

07:39.641 --> 07:41.408
All right, Lutz is the driver.

07:41.476 --> 07:42.993
W-wait.
How big is your car?

07:43.077 --> 07:44.811
- Can it fit all of us?
- Oh, right.

07:44.863 --> 07:46.480
It's actually pretty small.

07:46.548 --> 07:49.550
I could only take
three of you...

07:49.617 --> 07:53.253
So I'll have to choose.

07:53.321 --> 07:55.088
That sucks.

07:55.156 --> 07:57.925
It's like a reality show
where you guys get to compete

07:57.992 --> 08:01.728
for a seat in my car
by proving how much you like me.

08:06.601 --> 08:08.435
Tracy, I need you
to do something.

08:08.503 --> 08:09.770
Of course, friend.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.672
Teamwork is the key to success.

08:11.739 --> 08:13.006
Yeah.

08:13.074 --> 08:15.609
You need to stay late
for a wardrobe fitting tonight.

08:15.677 --> 08:17.377
It should take about two hours.

08:17.445 --> 08:18.745
Okay.

08:18.813 --> 08:20.180
No problem.

08:20.248 --> 08:22.950
After that, I need you
to record that DVD commentary

08:23.017 --> 08:25.452
that you've been putting off
for five years.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.121
Hope you didn't have
plans tonight.

08:28.189 --> 08:30.691
No, I wasn't gonna buy
two blimps

08:30.758 --> 08:33.126
and crash them into each other
to see what sound they made.

08:33.193 --> 08:36.129
Look, is there anything that
you two could maybe fight about?

08:36.197 --> 08:38.465
An argument that culminates in
a racial slur would be lovely.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.467
Sorry, this is gonna be nice
and boring.

08:40.534 --> 08:43.070
Tracy's even going to agree
to attend a fundraiser

08:43.136 --> 08:44.972
for my cousin's dance studio.

08:45.039 --> 08:46.406
Aren't you, Tracy?

08:50.278 --> 08:51.612
So we're good?

08:51.679 --> 08:53.247
Never better.

08:53.314 --> 08:56.049
I'm as happy as a clam
that wants to kill some woman.

08:56.117 --> 08:58.185
Great.
You're the best.

08:58.236 --> 08:59.353
Love you!

09:00.438 --> 09:02.122
Love you more!

09:04.392 --> 09:06.893
Boy, I-I don't know, Jack.
This just doesn't feel right.

09:06.961 --> 09:08.428
Bob, it's for charity.

09:08.496 --> 09:11.131
And if you don't do it,
I'll have MSNBC tell the world

09:11.199 --> 09:12.599
you grew up in England.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.468
But I'm
so identified with New York,

09:14.535 --> 09:15.736
you bloody tosser!

09:15.803 --> 09:18.739
Bob...

09:18.806 --> 09:20.924
Okay.

09:21.009 --> 09:23.010
Disaster options, take one.

09:23.077 --> 09:25.078
"We'll always remember
where we were

09:25.146 --> 09:27.948
"when we heard that tornado
had hit a handgun factory.

09:28.016 --> 09:30.484
"Two days ago, when people
thought of a mudslide,

09:30.551 --> 09:32.819
"they just thought of getting
drunk in an Applebee's.

09:32.887 --> 09:36.256
"But now we know it as
the thing that destroyed Denver.

09:36.307 --> 09:38.458
"When the birds first
started attacking us,

09:38.526 --> 09:41.295
"we all thought it was pretty
funny and made Hitchcock jokes.

09:41.362 --> 09:42.963
"But we're not laughing now,

09:43.031 --> 09:46.033
"because our laughter excites
the birds sexually.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.702
"This devastating wildfire.

09:48.770 --> 09:50.370
"This horrible flood.

09:50.438 --> 09:52.139
"This wonderful flood

09:52.206 --> 09:54.608
"that put out
that devastating wildfire.

09:54.676 --> 09:57.911
These super-intelligent sharks."

09:59.664 --> 10:01.682
Tracy, I just thought

10:01.749 --> 10:03.583
of a few more things
I need from you.

10:03.635 --> 10:06.353

This is great stuff,
but that's Billy Joel's.

10:17.532 --> 10:18.999
Anything you sing
to that tune, uh...

10:19.067 --> 10:20.400

Fantastic, Jenna.
You really brought

11:45.213 --> 11:47.864
the songwriting computer's
words to life.

11:47.932 --> 11:50.534
Wow, you're actually
doing this.

11:50.602 --> 11:52.603
Yes, all I'm missing
is the disaster.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.137
Well, I'm in the middle
of a Tracy disaster.

11:54.205 --> 11:56.006
I thought I could use
Angie's cameras

11:56.074 --> 11:58.442
to make him behave,
but he found a loophole,

11:58.509 --> 12:00.661
and now, to close it,
I need $80,000

12:00.745 --> 12:02.379
to buy the rights
to <i>Uptown Girl.</i>

12:02.447 --> 12:03.547
Lemon, it sounds like

12:03.615 --> 12:05.048
you're trying to fight crazy
with crazy.

12:05.116 --> 12:06.516
Yeah, because crazy
is the only language

12:06.584 --> 12:07.718
that Tracy is fluent in.

12:07.785 --> 12:09.186
But you'll never
out-crazy Tracy,

12:09.254 --> 12:10.520
so why don't you have it out
with him

12:10.588 --> 12:12.155
once and for all,
like two adults?

12:12.223 --> 12:13.557
Because we're not
two adults, Jack.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.692
One of us is an actor,
and actors are not people.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.061
Someone get a P.A.
to feed me baby food,

12:18.129 --> 12:20.330
or I will drop a "d"
in the green room!

12:20.398 --> 12:21.732
Yeah.

12:21.799 --> 12:25.469
Last week you thought
I was crying wolf, didn't you?

12:25.536 --> 12:26.853
Lutz is the best.

12:26.938 --> 12:29.323
- Nice feet, Lutz.
- I like Lutz the most.

12:29.407 --> 12:30.974
Look at all of you
trying to impress me.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.543
I feel like the bachelor.

12:33.611 --> 12:37.147
But, uh,
whom shall I give my rose?

12:39.483 --> 12:43.537
It's so hard to choose
when everyone loves me so much.

12:43.621 --> 12:47.174
But only three of you
can ride to safety in my car.

12:47.258 --> 12:48.342
Mmm!

12:50.795 --> 12:52.829
I don't really have a car.

12:56.868 --> 12:59.903
Tracy, your little
singing game is over.

12:59.971 --> 13:01.905
I got auto-tune
for my computer,

13:01.973 --> 13:04.308
and if you try to sing,
I'll just take out the melody,

13:04.375 --> 13:05.976
and no one has to pay for that.

13:06.044 --> 13:07.844
♪ Liz Lemon won ♪

13:07.912 --> 13:09.313
♪ do do do do ♪

13:09.364 --> 13:11.848
That was me singing the Beatles'
<i>Here Comes the Sun</i>

13:11.916 --> 13:12.883
for free.

13:12.950 --> 13:14.184
L.L., please.

13:14.235 --> 13:16.536
I'm way ahead of you.

13:16.621 --> 13:17.888
And I'm not rehearsing.

13:17.955 --> 13:19.856
I'm going to shoot
garden gnomes with a handgun

13:19.907 --> 13:21.024
at Tupac's house.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.576
Yeah, Tupac is alive.

13:22.660 --> 13:24.544
I bet you'd like to have that
on your show.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.029
Yes, Tracy, obviously.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.364
But again,
I can't use any of it

13:27.432 --> 13:28.699
when you're wearing that mask.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.384
The Rangers logo
is trademarked.

13:30.468 --> 13:32.169
Okay, fine.
Jack was right.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.370
I can't out-crazy you.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.255
So we're gonna talk, right now.

13:35.340 --> 13:36.506
No cameras.

13:40.711 --> 13:43.380
All right, Tracy,
the kid gloves are coming off.

13:43.448 --> 13:46.316
Oh, that explains it.
Those are gloves.

13:46.384 --> 13:48.418
No wonder they're
so coarse and wrinkly.

13:48.486 --> 13:51.321
Five years ago,
I rescued your career.

13:51.389 --> 13:52.773
And how do you repay me?

13:52.857 --> 13:55.325
By making my life harder
at every turn.

13:55.393 --> 13:57.560
You are late.
You blow off rehearsals.

13:57.612 --> 14:00.330
And your online romance prank
was not funny!

14:00.398 --> 14:01.565
I fell in love with you!

14:02.834 --> 14:04.751
You wore a yellow hat
to that coffee shop.

14:04.836 --> 14:06.937
You know what's actually funny
about all this?

14:07.004 --> 14:08.572
You think I'm the problem.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.474
Have you ever tried to work
with you?

14:10.541 --> 14:12.576
Really?
You're trying to blame me?

14:12.643 --> 14:15.011
Five years ago,
I saved your show.

14:15.079 --> 14:17.080
I rode in here on a white horse

14:17.148 --> 14:18.815
that you made me leave
in the lobby.

14:18.883 --> 14:22.319
All you do is stifle me
when you should be thanking me.

14:22.387 --> 14:23.854
Oh, yeah,
I should be thanking you.

14:23.921 --> 14:27.474
Without me, do you have any idea
where you would be right now?

14:27.558 --> 14:30.193
This honky grandma be trippin'

14:30.261 --> 14:32.295
over surfmaster's
mid-range jet skis!

14:32.363 --> 14:35.315
Where do you think
you would be without me?

14:35.400 --> 14:36.817
Now, Jerry, in rehearsal,

14:36.901 --> 14:38.769
it's okay
to play with yourself.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.337
But when we do the show...

14:40.405 --> 14:42.772
Hey, dummy, you got
to drive me to paintball,

14:42.824 --> 14:44.040
and no complaining.

14:44.108 --> 14:45.459
The only reason
why I got that DUI

14:45.543 --> 14:47.144
is 'cause it was your birthday.

14:47.211 --> 14:50.113
What's up, Jerry?
That's awesome.

14:50.181 --> 14:53.316
Well, at least Jerry
bothered to come to rehearsal.

14:53.384 --> 14:55.302
And in my alternate reality,

14:55.386 --> 14:57.621
Dennis dies,
and I win the lottery.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.623
But then I would run you over
with a jet ski!

14:59.690 --> 15:01.624
Damn it!

15:03.094 --> 15:05.962
Jonathan, come in here!

15:06.030 --> 15:07.630
Fantastic news...

15:07.682 --> 15:09.900
There's been
a natural disaster.

15:09.967 --> 15:11.435
Was it in Indian Kashmir?

15:11.502 --> 15:13.937
May Durga's trident pierce them
from the skies!

15:14.005 --> 15:16.506
No. A typhoon just hit
an island in the South Pacific,

15:16.574 --> 15:18.208
and news is going
to full-time coverage!

15:18.276 --> 15:20.577
It's perfect.
The island is called Mago.

15:20.645 --> 15:21.878
It's near Fiji.

15:21.946 --> 15:23.646
Heavy structural damage,
no fatalities...

15:23.698 --> 15:25.081
Sad, but not too sad.

15:25.149 --> 15:27.284
We'll get footage
of beautiful Polynesian people,

15:27.351 --> 15:28.535
proud and topless,

15:28.619 --> 15:30.821
maybe a pelican
near some diapers.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.022
I don't know.

15:32.089 --> 15:33.573
Oh, it's all happening so fast.

15:33.658 --> 15:35.258
We haven't even given
this plan a code name.

15:35.326 --> 15:36.543
Haven't we?

15:36.627 --> 15:39.996
Operation Righteous
Cowboy Lightning is a go.

15:46.204 --> 15:47.671
Okay, first of all,
I look weird there

15:47.722 --> 15:48.772
because I'm "snarting."

15:48.840 --> 15:50.807
You "snarted"
in my dressing room?

15:50.875 --> 15:53.143
And second of all,
I said no cameras.

15:53.211 --> 15:55.946
That footage cannot be shown
on television.

15:56.013 --> 15:58.114
I'm trying to buy
a island over here.

15:58.182 --> 15:59.599
I'm sorry, Tray,
but now I just need

15:59.684 --> 16:00.984
a heartfelt resolution.

16:01.052 --> 16:02.986
So we're gonna use
a little reality-TV magic.

16:03.054 --> 16:05.322
We call it staging it or lying.

16:05.389 --> 16:07.190
We'll shoot you guys
meeting in the hallway.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.959
Uh, you apologize, you hug.

16:09.026 --> 16:11.094
Ugh.
You are disgusting.

16:11.162 --> 16:13.797
And I have absolutely no reason
to apologize to him.

16:13.865 --> 16:15.298
And I have no reason
to hug her,

16:15.366 --> 16:17.767
other than my love of having
boobs pressed against me.

16:17.835 --> 16:18.902
If I hugged you,

16:18.970 --> 16:20.420
I would angle it
so that you got no boob.

16:20.505 --> 16:22.172
And I would anticipate
your angling,

16:22.239 --> 16:23.406
and I would get there.

16:23.474 --> 16:25.976
I would get there.

16:27.044 --> 16:28.795
Yah!

16:28.880 --> 16:32.616
Hey, buddy, I made you
an apocalypse road trip mix.

16:32.683 --> 16:34.284
I hope your car
has a CD player.

16:34.352 --> 16:35.919
It has two.

16:35.987 --> 16:37.587
And it has flames on the side.

16:37.655 --> 16:38.922
Oh.

16:38.973 --> 16:40.941
Lutzy, guess what.

16:41.025 --> 16:42.642
A friend of mine works
for Marvel,

16:42.727 --> 16:44.661
and he got me four tickets
to a test screening

16:44.729 --> 16:46.613
of <i>Captain America</i> tonight!

16:46.697 --> 16:48.097
Nice!

16:48.149 --> 16:50.984
Chris Evans' body
looks amazing in the trailer.

16:51.068 --> 16:52.669
When's his
<i>Men's Health</i> cover?

16:52.737 --> 16:57.040
Okay, so who you gonna take
with you besides Frank?

16:59.000 --> 17:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:07.885 --> 17:08.885
Dude, make up your mind.

17:08.953 --> 17:10.453
We have to be in Harrison
by 6:00.

17:10.503 --> 17:12.422
Wait.
It's in New Jersey?

17:12.490 --> 17:13.957
How are we getting
to New Jersey?

17:14.025 --> 17:15.892
You're going to drive us,
obviously.

17:17.511 --> 17:21.131
What am I gonna do?

17:21.198 --> 17:23.132
Where have you been, sir?
Have you seen the news?

17:23.184 --> 17:25.300
I don't have to, Jonathan.
I know what's on it...

17:25.353 --> 17:26.836
The poor people of Mago Island

17:26.904 --> 17:28.972
and their brave
shorts-wearing police force.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.540
If you're just joining us,

17:30.608 --> 17:32.075
this is NBC's
continuing coverage

17:32.143 --> 17:34.010
of the devastation in Mago...

17:34.078 --> 17:37.530
the Fijian island owned by
controversial actor Mel Gibson.

17:37.615 --> 17:38.531
Good God.

17:38.616 --> 17:40.450
We are receiving reports

17:40.518 --> 17:42.118
of extensive damage
to the main house,

17:42.169 --> 17:44.504
as well as the house
for Gibson's cars.

17:44.589 --> 17:46.823
No word yet on the fate
of Gibson's collection

17:46.891 --> 17:50.343
of anti-semitic
and misogynistic literature.

17:50.428 --> 17:52.329
No!

17:52.396 --> 17:54.881
No, this is not a prank.
This is Jack Donaghy.

17:54.966 --> 17:57.968
And I'm calling about Operation
Righteous Cowboy Lightning.

17:58.019 --> 17:59.603
Hello?

17:59.670 --> 18:01.204
We are joined now by a relative

18:01.272 --> 18:03.506
of the island's owner...
Oskar Gibson.

18:03.557 --> 18:04.708
G'day.

18:04.775 --> 18:07.861
First off, the holocaust
never happened.

18:07.945 --> 18:11.531
Aah!

18:13.484 --> 18:16.853
We go now to NBC's exclusive
primetime benefit

18:16.921 --> 18:19.089
for the victims
of the devastation in Mago,

18:19.156 --> 18:21.825

18:30.835 --> 18:32.736

19:08.005 --> 19:10.173
Dude, did you just buy
that car?

19:10.241 --> 19:11.441
What?

19:11.509 --> 19:13.176
There's a dealer sticker
in the window,

19:13.243 --> 19:14.611
you got no plates,

19:14.679 --> 19:16.880

19:16.947 --> 19:18.782
I'd rather die
than ride with him.

19:18.849 --> 19:20.583

Are you okay?

Oh, you're kidding.

20:35.357 --> 20:37.158
Your dumb stunt worked?

It was our highest rating

20:39.928 --> 20:41.829
where the detectives
watched <i>American Idol.</i>

20:41.880 --> 20:43.464

20:43.515 --> 20:44.549
It was reality TV.

It can be terrible.

20:45.968 --> 20:47.435
It just can't be
anything in between.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.319
You know, some people
actually craft stories.

20:51.439 --> 20:54.939
And when the story doesn't have an ending
you don't just create one out of thin air

20:54.984 --> 20:58.561
by playing music or having people
give each other meaningful looks.

20:58.681 --> 21:00.511
