00:43.651 --> 00:47.225
In New York City there is a
fine line between law and chaos.

00:47.525 --> 00:51.600
On that line live Danson and Highsmith.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.750
Tell me again why I
decided to get on this roof?

00:56.214 --> 01:00.532
I think you can chop that
up to bad life choices

01:15.713 --> 01:18.094
Get rid of that asshole
- O o

01:18.095 --> 01:19.096
I knew when you say "O o"

01:29.687 --> 01:32.719
O dude, you put a dent in my hood.

01:35.148 --> 01:37.653
Come on.

01:49.086 --> 01:53.057
That's trouble

02:05.004 --> 02:11.171
Uh.. Did someone
call 9-1-holy shit?

02:18.533 --> 02:23.721
That's it.. I'm sick of all this running

02:27.683 --> 02:31.846
- Hang on...

02:41.111 --> 02:45.083
You have the right to remain silent...

02:45.584 --> 02:47.638
... but I want to hear you scream...

03:02.543 --> 03:03.538
Stay on the ground!

03:05.582 --> 03:06.821
Detective! Detective!

03:06.999 --> 03:08.581
One at a time, all right?

03:09.779 --> 03:12.503
Yeah Detective, Rick Rayston,
New York Observer... online

03:13.140 --> 03:15.011
These suspects were caught with only
a quarter of pound of marijuana...

03:15.630 --> 03:17.916
a misdemeanor in some
states. Do you think this

03:17.917 --> 03:20.070
arrest was worth 12
million in property damages?

03:20.632 --> 03:23.037
Why don't we let New York
City answer that question?

03:23.380 --> 03:25.436
The greatest city on earth! Yeah!

03:29.661 --> 03:32.093
Uh.. Sarah Capone from
TMZ... print edition,

03:32.972 --> 03:35.496
uh, Danson, are the rumors about
you and Kim Kardashian true?

03:36.019 --> 03:36.469
No comment.

03:37.531 --> 03:38.607
But, yes.

03:40.682 --> 03:44.107
Danson and Highsmith,
free hot dogs... for life!

03:47.849 --> 03:51.538
No drinks... No drinks
Can't do it... I can't do it

03:51.573 --> 03:54.805
Danson and Highsmith,
shoot, drive and sex in style

03:54.840 --> 03:58.039
They are rock stars...
Then you got your jokers,

03:58.074 --> 04:00.027
your ball busters, your vets...

04:00.062 --> 04:01.775
... and the other guys...

04:04.791 --> 04:08.273
We know... we know... we know...

04:08.688 --> 04:10.583
all right.. all right.. all
right.. listen up! listen up!

04:10.618 --> 04:13.558
We have a celebration tonight at Butter,

04:13.593 --> 04:18.458
Brody Jenner is gonna be there..., Bai
Ling..., Della Shortpit from Jersey Shore...,

04:18.874 --> 04:23.471
And... most of you are on the list
- You're the best.

04:24.783 --> 04:27.730
And I'm gonna say something right now,
it's about a man who came from Austria...

04:28.668 --> 04:29.680
... with a dream
- Arnold Schwarzenegger!

04:29.715 --> 04:30.661
Let me finish.

04:31.101 --> 04:33.477
He became a champion,
and a movie star...

04:33.512 --> 04:34.578
- Arnold Schwarzenegger!

04:34.613 --> 04:37.708
God damn it, let me fini.. They ruined
the story... they ruined the story

04:38.256 --> 04:42.500
No, the point is, we couldn't do our job if it
weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork,...

04:42.535 --> 04:44.732
answering the phone and all the
stupid shit that we don't like to do...

04:44.767 --> 04:46.649
All the gun fights, all the car chases,

04:46.650 --> 04:49.883
all the sex we don't want to have
with women... but we have to...

04:50.456 --> 04:54.070
All due to what you guys do. Thank you.

04:54.105 --> 04:57.408
And we do it again and again
- Ay, ay, ay! You shut your face!

04:57.443 --> 04:59.243
If we want to hear you talk, I'll shove

04:59.244 --> 05:01.782
my arm up your ass and work
your mouth like a puppet!

05:02.047 --> 05:04.315
You hear me? You hear me?

05:04.350 --> 05:06.586
- Peace out, bitches.

05:09.241 --> 05:13.299
Hey, fellas. all right, bring it
in. Come on, bring it a little bit

05:13.334 --> 05:17.368
All right. Right there.
Just back.. right there

05:17.767 --> 05:21.766
Just... just one... there you
go... right there.. right there

05:22.164 --> 05:24.643
This is their paperwork, you
know they are not gonna do it

05:24.858 --> 05:26.929
- That's right
- This paperwork work is like Bob's wife here

05:26.964 --> 05:32.114
Stick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it. No offence, Bob
- That's all right

05:32.896 --> 05:35.044
Anyway, now who wants it?
- I do

05:35.079 --> 05:39.021
All right! Paper bitch and Yankee Clip are on the case.
- Nice work. Thanks, Allen.

05:39.570 --> 05:41.443
Thank you, Captain.
- I do it. I do it

05:50.163 --> 05:54.145
Stop humming that song!
- I can hum if I want to

05:54.180 --> 05:57.339
I know you can, I am asking you to stop.

05:57.374 --> 05:59.874
Well, if you're asking then I'll stop.
- Thank you.

06:04.579 --> 06:06.302
Could you not smile like that?

06:06.337 --> 06:10.126
Now you're asking me to mask my emotions
because of how it makes you feel...

06:10.458 --> 06:11.262
that I will not do

06:16.047 --> 06:19.770
Seriously, stop humming! Ok? This
isn't accounting or wherever the

06:19.771 --> 06:23.383
hell you and your little pockey
calculator were transferred from

06:23.418 --> 06:27.693
Forensic accounting. Ok? It is an important part of the job
- Yeah Whatever

06:27.728 --> 06:31.372
Stop being verbally happy about doing shitwork, you moron
- Hey guys

06:31.407 --> 06:35.212
Reminder: The police unit
picnic's coming up this weekend.

06:35.247 --> 06:38.307
My wife's making her
famous devil eggs again.

06:38.342 --> 06:41.364
My waistline is furious.
- It's a bad time, Bob!

06:41.365 --> 06:43.001
All right

06:44.398 --> 06:48.287
I wanna get that slice

06:57.587 --> 07:00.168
You know what I just did? I
just walked out that door...

07:00.203 --> 07:04.410
saw a couple of detectives down there and I was
about to start badmouthing you behind your back...

07:04.445 --> 07:08.618
but I stopped myself because my Pop taught me that
a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.

07:08.653 --> 07:12.279
Wow, I actually appreciate that.
- Good, coz I am gonna tell you directly to your face!

07:12.314 --> 07:14.015
No, you don't have to
- No I don't like you

07:14.050 --> 07:19.153
I think you're a fake cop. The sound of your
piss hitting the urinal, it sounds feminine

07:19.188 --> 07:24.009
If you were in the wild, I would attack
you, even if you weren't in my food chain.

07:24.044 --> 07:28.433
I would go out of my way to attack you.
If I were a lion and you were a tuna,

07:28.468 --> 07:33.074
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and
freaking eat you and then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.

07:34.389 --> 07:40.079
Ok, first off: a lion, swimming in
the ocean. Lions don't like water

07:40.114 --> 07:43.895
If you placed it near a river or some sort
of fresh water source, that make sense.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.172
But you find yourself in
the ocean, 20 foot wave,

07:46.207 --> 07:49.812
I'm assuming off the coast of
South Africa, coming up against

07:49.813 --> 07:53.010
a full grown 800 pound tuna
with his 20 or 30 friends,

07:53.045 --> 07:57.768
you lose that battle, you lose that
battle 9 times out of 10. And guess what,

07:57.803 --> 08:02.877
you've wandered into our school of tuna and we now
have a taste of lion. We've talked to ourselves.

08:02.912 --> 08:08.508
We've communicated and said 'You know what,
lion tastes good, let's go get some more lion'.

08:08.543 --> 08:13.526
We've developed a system to establish a beach-head
and aggressively hunt you and your family and

08:13.561 --> 08:17.799
we will corner your pride, your children, your offspring.
- How you gonna do that?

08:17.834 --> 08:21.072
We will construct a series of
breathing apparatus with kelp.

08:21.073 --> 08:23.780
We will be able to trap
certain amounts of oxygen.

08:23.815 --> 08:28.304
It's not gonna be days at a time.
An hour? Hour forty-five? No problem.

08:28.339 --> 08:31.261
That will give us enough time
to figure out where you live,

08:31.262 --> 08:33.991
go back to the sea, get more
oxygen, and then stalk you

08:34.025 --> 08:37.445
You just lost at your own game.
You're outgunned and out-manned.

08:40.697 --> 08:44.511
Did that go the way you
thought it was gonna go? Nope!

08:51.872 --> 08:55.238
Two minutes before the markets open,
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global

08:55.273 --> 08:58.815
ringing the opening bell. With
Boardman is investment banker,

08:58.816 --> 09:02.415
David Ershon, who manages 40%
of Lendl $70 billion equity pool

09:02.450 --> 09:05.410
How much did we lose?

09:05.445 --> 09:08.283
You may ring the bell now Ms. Boardman.
- 32.

09:08.318 --> 09:11.731
Million?
- No, billion

09:16.137 --> 09:20.935
Chinatown, three triad gang members. I
popped two of them off the draw. Bang! Bang!

09:20.970 --> 09:25.120
Then I raise up to take the leader out.
- O shit! I feel like I'm there now

09:25.155 --> 09:27.531
I hear a whistle. My
partner's on the roof.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.124
He says: Let's even the odds!

09:29.159 --> 09:33.003
He tosses me down a mos? pump,
I sent one through his chest.

09:33.037 --> 09:35.982
Game over, bitches

09:41.296 --> 09:45.455
Jimmy, let's talk about
how that story made you feel

09:45.490 --> 09:47.876
Like a Viagra pill with a face.

09:50.396 --> 09:53.610
I know it's very tempting. You
wanna impress your friends...

09:53.645 --> 09:59.840
but this is serious stuff we're dealing with.
Ok? This is firing your weapon in the line of duty

09:59.875 --> 10:00.727
Officer Hoitz

10:04.175 --> 10:05.332
Here we go.
- Would you like to share?

10:05.367 --> 10:08.797
I'd rather not.
- Officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months.

10:08.832 --> 10:14.574
And you haven't said a word. Safe environment, no judgement here
- Douchebag

10:14.609 --> 10:17.284
- That's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.

10:17.319 --> 10:18.656
I relive it every night.

10:18.691 --> 10:23.125
The Bronx, October. Game
7 of the World Series.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.046
Got a marvellous high pressure
handling the crowd. I pull tunnel duty

10:26.081 --> 10:29.769
Then I saw a shadow figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.
- Wow wow wow

10:29.804 --> 10:32.388
This is a restricted area.
I finally pulled my gun.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.629
Don't make me shoot, I'll do it.

10:35.664 --> 10:38.813
Are you deaf?

10:38.848 --> 10:41.545
You dick, I'm Derek Jeter. You shot me

10:41.580 --> 10:44.335
You cost me 20 grand on that game
- Douchebag

10:44.370 --> 10:48.010
I cost the city a championship. I was
being groomed for top position in Homicide

10:48.045 --> 10:51.649
Now I'm stuck with a desk junky partner
and everybody calls me the Yankee clipper.

10:51.684 --> 10:54.462
Because you shot Derek Jeter
- He's a biracial angel.

10:54.497 --> 10:55.861
You should've shot Evra

11:03.526 --> 11:06.652
Yo, Paper Bitch. -
What's up man? - Hey guys

11:06.687 --> 11:07.632
Paper bitch! Paper bitch

11:07.633 --> 11:11.018
- I don't like that actually. I know you
guys think it's fun. But I don't like that.

11:11.053 --> 11:13.724
Still working on Danson and Highsmith paperwork?
- No, actually...

11:13.759 --> 11:17.333
What is this? - Guys - Illegal
permitting for construction.

11:17.368 --> 11:20.872
Specifically scaffolding
- Some of the guys were talking...

11:20.907 --> 11:25.206
they are like, how come you never fired your weapon in the office before?
- Good point.

11:25.241 --> 11:28.605
I am sorry. I don't follow
- You never fired your weapon in the office.

11:28.639 --> 11:30.673
We all have, you know,
it's called the desk pop.

11:30.674 --> 11:33.332
- Fellas, look, I know you don't
respect me as a police officer

11:33.367 --> 11:36.998
Not true,
- I'm not stupid. I am not going to discharge my firearm in the office

11:37.033 --> 11:39.758
Listen to me! I'll try to make
it real clear. We honor the flag.

11:39.759 --> 11:42.400
And you crap on it when you
don't shoot your gun in the office

11:42.435 --> 11:46.392
Jimmy, when was the last time you had a desk pop?
- September 2008.

11:46.427 --> 11:47.996
Be a man. Do it.

11:48.031 --> 11:50.223
Please, please do it.
- Pop one off!

11:50.258 --> 11:52.415
Pop it off
- Don't think just go!

11:52.450 --> 11:53.437
Here we go!
- Yes!

11:56.863 --> 11:59.542
Hey, shot fired!
- Hey Terry! I did it! I did my first desk pop

11:59.577 --> 12:04.420
It's a real thing right?
- A desk pop?

12:04.455 --> 12:07.650
Yeah! - Not it's not! -
They were so convincing.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.756
.. in their argument. They swung me.

12:09.791 --> 12:15.395
You're gonna have to hand over your gun.
- Yes, sir.

12:15.430 --> 12:19.380
Captain, If you really want to disarm this
guy, take out the batteries in the calculator.

12:19.415 --> 12:23.330
All right, I am gonna give you this: This
is a dummy gun. They used this for ceremony.

12:25.448 --> 12:27.967
You get this back when I
feel you know how to handle it.

12:28.002 --> 12:34.867
Listen guys, I am working two jobs: I am working
here, I got another job at Bed, Bath and Beyond

12:34.902 --> 12:40.661
Ok? I am doing that just to put the kid
through NYU so he can explore his bisexuality...

12:40.696 --> 12:44.313
become a DJ. Now the last thing
I need is a ballistics report

12:44.314 --> 12:47.572
in the unit. Just gonna ask
you guys. Please, come on!

12:47.607 --> 12:49.938
Really, just think
about it. Just be smart.

13:17.092 --> 13:22.794
2-11 in progress. They are using a
wrecking ball to clean up Caspian Jewellery

13:22.829 --> 13:25.871
We got it!
- Good luck guys, have a good one.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.695
Let's go! - No, I got work
to do. - What? This is work!

13:30.610 --> 13:32.959
Danson and Highsmith are rolling heavy

13:32.994 --> 13:35.665
Creampuff, sit tight.
- You got to be shitting me?

13:35.700 --> 13:38.416
You can't keep me cooked up in here, ok?

13:38.451 --> 13:41.133
I am a peacock, you got to let me fly!

13:48.229 --> 13:49.404
Did he just.. did he just
call himself a peacock?

13:52.853 --> 13:53.754
Let's go!

13:56.786 --> 14:00.960
Come on, fellas. Wednesday night
is taco night at Rancor's island

14:13.376 --> 14:16.037
Awww, The second one this week.

14:17.678 --> 14:19.191
Hey you monkeys! Stop!

14:19.347 --> 14:20.005
Let's go!

14:22.383 --> 14:23.385
Hands up.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.575
Special Forces zip line

14:42.867 --> 14:44.261
These guys are pros

14:45.557 --> 14:48.744
You're thinking what I'm thinking, partner?
- Aim for the bushes.

15:14.221 --> 15:18.648
Cops still argue to this day
why Danson and Highsmith jump

15:18.683 --> 15:22.276
Maybe it was just pride having
survived so many brushes with death.

15:22.427 --> 15:25.692
Maybe their ego pushed
them off. I don't know

15:25.727 --> 15:28.569
but that shit was crazy. Either way...

15:28.604 --> 15:31.717
there was a hole in New York
City that needed to be filled.

15:31.752 --> 15:37.461
Two days ago, the City wept, we lost
two heroes who get everything for us...

15:37.496 --> 15:43.169
who pay that ultimate sacrifice so
that we may walk these streets safely

15:43.813 --> 15:46.386
There wasn't even an awning in that garage.
- No, I know.

15:46.421 --> 15:48.925
They jumped from 20 stories.
- Doesn't make sense, does it?

15:48.960 --> 15:53.796
I only hope Got lets them take their .357s with them to heaven to keep, to...
- It's our moment, Allen

15:53.831 --> 15:56.145
Our moment to step up and be the guys.

15:56.180 --> 15:58.425
We're at a funeral. Show some respect.

15:58.460 --> 16:01.945
What? You don't think every other detective
here isn't thinking the same thing?

16:04.755 --> 16:09.758
Allen, listen to me, Danson and Highsmith are gone.
Their desks right? Someone has to fill those seats

16:09.793 --> 16:11.158
And that someone is us

16:11.193 --> 16:14.568
Ok? The city's dying for a hero.
- Is it?

16:14.603 --> 16:14.859
Yeah!

16:14.860 --> 16:20.493
- What about nine million socially conscious and unified
citizens all just stepping up and doing their part?

16:20.528 --> 16:22.875
As a little kid, didn't you
dress up like cops and a robbers?

16:22.909 --> 16:26.763
I'll tell you what I did as a little
kid, I went to school, I made my bed...

16:26.798 --> 16:29.544
and at age eleven, I audited my parents.

16:29.579 --> 16:33.451
Believe me, there were some
discrepancies, and I was grounded.

16:33.486 --> 16:37.322
What the hell are you?
- Well, well, well. What we got here?

16:37.357 --> 16:39.022
Look at these two jummocks, would you?

16:39.057 --> 16:41.548
One shot Jeter and the
other shot an office.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.841
Have some decorum,
we're at a funeral. Shhh

16:46.876 --> 16:52.387
You want to dance, huh? I will
rock your body with big nasty hooks

16:52.422 --> 16:55.826
Ripping some blood out of your ass.
- That's horrible. - Would you step back, man?

16:56.256 --> 16:59.453
You touch him, I swear to God I am gonna
beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.

16:59.488 --> 17:02.415
- He's not gonna do that. That's like
verbally, but that's one weird example.

17:02.450 --> 17:04.114
You wanna go?
- I wanna go!

17:05.590 --> 17:07.903
Kick his ass, Martin!
- How do you like that?

17:13.377 --> 17:15.859
Really sorry for your loss, mam.
- Lovely hat.

17:15.895 --> 17:20.487
I love your shoes. - It's
fine. It's fine - Go! Go!

17:21.954 --> 17:23.383
Ah, man!

17:24.367 --> 17:26.012
You don't know how to do it!
That's how you do it in the hood!

17:28.124 --> 17:30.083
Pay the winner. Pay for
the winner. Everybody saw!

17:31.295 --> 17:32.198
What the hell is going on here?

17:32.478 --> 17:35.120
Two good men are dead and
you guys are fighting...

17:35.155 --> 17:38.625
of who's gonna be the next hot
shot, huh? Is that what's happening?

17:38.626 --> 17:40.615
- Yes, that's exactly what's happening!

17:40.650 --> 17:42.653
Let me say something about those guys.

17:42.654 --> 17:46.076
They knew that to become a good
cop, you have to solve cases...

17:46.111 --> 17:51.361
Ok? And maybe you start
with Castian robbery. Ok?

17:51.396 --> 17:52.196
Watch it!

17:52.231 --> 17:56.444
Next time: Me, You, Library.
- Not even close!

17:58.275 --> 18:01.528
I am the winner.
- I didn't need you to stick up for me ok?

18:01.563 --> 18:04.780
I could've handled that myself.
- Don't flatter yourself.

18:04.815 --> 18:06.635
It's partners Code. I had no choice.

18:15.587 --> 18:22.178
9:15, let's have a great day everybody.
- Cut the shit!

18:26.112 --> 18:27.487
Good morning.

18:27.522 --> 18:32.053
We've got shot fired.
509 East 10th Street.

18:32.088 --> 18:35.565
There are large amounts of cocaine on the
scene. Try to stay out of trouble, boys.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.123
There's no chance you are going on that call right?
- No chance, too busy.

18:39.245 --> 18:43.164
All right ladies, starting to get the picture? We're about to lock shit down.
- That's right

18:43.199 --> 18:47.085
You girls stay here and get your type on
- Go get them guys. A lot of energy, a lot of focus.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.539
Shut up.
- Allen, Can I see you in the hallway for a second?

18:50.807 --> 18:53.401
I.. I'm super busy right now.
- No, no, no, I know. This will be real quick.

18:53.436 --> 18:56.970
It's about the construction permits we talking about.
- The Scaffolding violation?

18:57.005 --> 18:58.073
This is our thing. Yeah.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.465
So, so what do you got?
- I got this.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.993
I hope you like your neck.
- What are you doing? - Let's go!

19:05.028 --> 19:06.240
We go to that call.

19:07.583 --> 19:10.252
What is this?
- Shut up! We're going to the car...

19:10.287 --> 19:11.650
and we're going after this case.
- You're not gonna shoot me.

19:11.685 --> 19:13.513
I won't? - No
- I shot Jeter.

19:13.548 --> 19:15.343
That was an accident.
- Was it?

19:15.378 --> 19:16.717
Move.

19:18.931 --> 19:21.809
Anybody see this? He's got a gun on me

19:21.844 --> 19:26.980
I am being kidnapped. Really? We're in a
police station and no one is seeing this?

19:27.015 --> 19:28.708
So then what happened?

19:28.743 --> 19:33.416
What do you think? I woke up, I took the belt off
my neck and I got my car and I got out of there.

19:33.451 --> 19:37.165
Talked about a wild weekend, huh?
- I thought I was going to shoot my way out.

19:37.848 --> 19:40.804
What are you gonna do though,
you know? Bar Mitzvah's.

19:42.121 --> 19:46.749
What the hell is this?
- It's my car. It's a Prius.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.230
I feel like we're literally
driving around in a vagina.

19:49.248 --> 19:53.299
Detective Hoitz and Gamble
on that 5-18 on East 10th.

19:53.361 --> 19:55.696
Negatory, Martin and
Fossi. Two minutes. Out.

19:55.731 --> 20:00.014
We'll just see who's there first.
- You stay out of our crime scene. You hear me?

20:00.049 --> 20:01.969
Go! Go! Go!

20:02.004 --> 20:06.662
Feel that Allen? Huh? That ting-a-ling in your balls,
big net of butterflies flying around in your stomach?

20:06.697 --> 20:10.100
Are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?
- I got something to keep you going.

20:12.156 --> 20:15.626
Let's go do some damage!

20:16.811 --> 20:17.408
Nope

20:19.661 --> 20:23.326
What the hell is that?
- LRB. Little River Band.

20:23.361 --> 20:25.756
This music makes me feel like I
am going shopping for training bra.

20:25.791 --> 20:31.011
You know what? We go with no music, ok? Good bye.
- No no!

20:31.046 --> 20:35.496
You just signed your death warrant, Hoitz!
- Allen, punch that accelerator or I'll shoot in you in the foot.

20:35.531 --> 20:36.584
America!

20:36.619 --> 20:42.066
Allen! The brake. Just slow the car down

20:42.101 --> 20:45.593
We're going to the crime scene.
- Yeah, yeah

20:46.614 --> 20:53.940
Dude!
- It's a lot of cocaine.

20:53.975 --> 20:58.766
Did you yell 'America' when
you hit the accelerator?

20:58.801 --> 20:59.556
Nope. No.

20:59.591 --> 21:07.565
I never actually put my foot all the way down
to the ground with the accelerator like that.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.686
You got me slightly aroused.

21:12.370 --> 21:15.351
Here we go.

21:15.386 --> 21:18.676
Way to put your stamp
on the crime scene, guys.

21:20.110 --> 21:21.994
A Prius huh?
- Yeah. Yup.

21:22.029 --> 21:24.534
Good mileage?
- Oh. Outstanding.

21:24.569 --> 21:27.038
Did this come with a dental dam?

21:27.896 --> 21:29.842
Get it?

21:30.738 --> 21:35.167
... shit one of these last night.
- I don't know that they put tampons on wheels.

21:35.202 --> 21:40.236
They have their fun, huh?
- Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.

21:41.264 --> 21:45.294
All right, everybody. We need y'all
to back up now. We're taking over

21:45.376 --> 21:49.408
"At the crime scene. LOL."
- Good tweet. - Yeah

21:49.443 --> 21:53.405
America was always been
defined by its excess.

21:53.440 --> 21:57.010
The Grand Canyon, professional
sports contracts...

21:57.045 --> 21:59.440
Wendy's bacon and eggs, extra bacon.

21:59.475 --> 22:02.734
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis

22:02.769 --> 22:05.990
And a Subaru station wagon.

22:06.026 --> 22:10.573
And it's because of this excess
that I have flourished, I employ you.

22:10.608 --> 22:14.434
Please, do not stop
profiting. Live for excess.

22:14.469 --> 22:16.463
It's the American way.

22:24.905 --> 22:27.148
Mr. Ershon, I believe
this call is for you.

22:27.783 --> 22:35.475
This is David.
- David, you're not returning my call, so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley...

22:35.510 --> 22:36.388
G'day, mate!

22:36.423 --> 22:41.517
Roger is gonna babysit you because I don't trust
you. Because I think you are going to take off.

22:41.552 --> 22:43.638
Pam, this is ridiculous,
I'm not going anywhere.

22:43.673 --> 22:48.846
David, listen, The Lendl quarterly come out on
the 26th. You have until then to give me my money.

22:48.881 --> 22:51.635
I am not reporting any losses, David.
- I have zero debt on the new

22:51.636 --> 22:54.630
investor.
- Then you get their money and get disappeared and pay us back.

22:54.856 --> 23:02.914
Yes, yes, I'll tell him he
doesn't have to keep watching me.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.658
So you're good to go.

23:04.693 --> 23:09.301
Heard everything, mate.
- Ladies and gentlemen, guess, who gave me the secret to making...

23:09.336 --> 23:11.521
my first billion dollars?

23:11.556 --> 23:16.426
That man.
- Go.

23:16.461 --> 23:19.868
Go. To the side please.

23:19.903 --> 23:21.698
You don't think I'm a real cop, do you?

23:21.699 --> 23:26.305
- No, I don't. I've said that directly to your
face numerous times. I was really honest about that.

23:26.340 --> 23:29.456
We are on a huge case. All right?
Property owner. With 7 buildings

23:29.457 --> 23:32.709
under construction, he hasn't applied
for a single scaffolding permit.

23:32.744 --> 23:37.170
Now, according to S Geeves, this Perv
is at Plaza Hotel speaking right now.

23:37.205 --> 23:40.482
That's your big case?
Scaffolding permits?

23:40.517 --> 23:43.760
Yeah. Guess what. You're coming with me.

23:43.795 --> 23:47.013
That's a wooden gun.

23:47.048 --> 23:50.195
Ow, that hurts, man.

23:50.230 --> 23:56.181
I've always got Little River Band
loaded. I got 6 discs in here.

23:56.216 --> 24:00.690
Meet me outside at the
back of the service entrance

24:00.725 --> 24:04.132
I am flying Air Singapore.
Hey Douglas, how's the wife?

24:04.167 --> 24:07.287
She died.
- Atta boy! I'll be there in two minutes exactly.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.394
Another thing I hate: You
always pay in exact change

24:10.429 --> 24:13.431
You're just mad because
I have a nice change purse

24:13.466 --> 24:16.314
Why do you even care?
- How can I help it? You know what?

24:16.349 --> 24:19.765
You know what's worst? The way you
fart. Even your farts. They're not manly.

24:19.800 --> 24:23.377
You're being ridiculous. - They sound like a baby
blowing out the candles at a birthday cake. - What?

24:23.412 --> 24:25.926
A little... bzzz.
- You know what bugs me about you?

24:25.961 --> 24:31.175
What? - I'm pretty sure you've never voted. - Oh
I vote. Sports Regular AMA 80. Player of the week.

24:31.210 --> 24:34.691
You're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.
- Get out of the way man.

24:34.726 --> 24:36.635
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

24:36.670 --> 24:41.163
Yes, Sir David Ershon. Doesn't
matter. I am in a little bit of a rush

24:41.198 --> 24:44.564
Gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you
- Excuse me, but you are under arrest

24:44.600 --> 24:47.469
Ok? You have the right to remain silent

24:47.504 --> 24:51.506
Anything you do or say can be
used um... What 's the next part?

24:51.541 --> 24:55.509
As a floatation device.
- As a floatation device. Ah you know what?

24:55.544 --> 24:58.307
Very funny. I have never
apprehended anyone before.

24:58.342 --> 25:01.036
Really? Are you guys for
real? Am I being punk'd?

25:01.071 --> 25:07.128
Detective Allen Gamble, we are in a cocaine
covered car and we're bring in a Perp...

25:07.163 --> 25:09.178
one David Ershon...
- 175 pounds

25:09.213 --> 25:11.148
175 pounds. Thank you.
- Shut up man! Shut up!

25:11.183 --> 25:14.459
Martin and Fossi are probably on Studio
beach talking to Sheppard Smith right now...

25:14.494 --> 25:17.260
We arrested this jerk-off
for a scaffolding permit?!

25:17.295 --> 25:21.948
W..wait, what am I being arrested for?
- Scaffolding permit violation.

25:29.881 --> 25:32.811
I got my insurance card...
- Easy, mate.

25:32.846 --> 25:36.070
They are driving into us.
- Stand over there. Wood.

25:37.389 --> 25:40.264
Couldn't see the car? It's big enough, mate?
- What?

25:40.299 --> 25:42.931
Do not let this man take me.

25:42.966 --> 25:46.204
Hi..
- Why is she looking at you like that?

25:46.239 --> 25:51.664
That's my car. Hey, hey, hey. We
didn't exchange.. insurance information

25:51.699 --> 25:55.406
Excuse me. Why did they take our shoes?

25:55.441 --> 25:58.772
What the hell just happened?
- Where's my iPhone?

26:00.113 --> 26:02.516
I think we walked 30 blocks.

26:02.551 --> 26:07.836
I don't get why we can't just call the
office and have a squad car come pick us up?

26:07.871 --> 26:12.184
No, they took our shoes, our guns and our
car. There's no way this going out on the radio

26:12.219 --> 26:15.524
If we gonna do this together, there
are some issues we need to settle, ok?

26:15.559 --> 26:19.571
You said I had a weak chin, you
said the way I peed in feminine.

26:19.572 --> 26:21.349
How do you think that
makes me feel? I mean,

26:21.384 --> 26:23.475
That list you have, you put a
lot of thought in. It's weird.

26:25.036 --> 26:26.222
I hear you.

26:27.302 --> 26:30.231
Let's clean the slate
right now. Fresh start.

26:31.431 --> 26:34.852
All right, fresh start.

26:34.887 --> 26:41.507
Maybe we should uh call ourselves the Fabreeze
Brothers, cause it's feeling so fresh right now.

26:41.542 --> 26:46.657
Right?
- Instead of a fresh start, I just wanna punch you in the face.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.456
Fresh start.

26:48.491 --> 26:54.251
It's the last one.
- I have to be able to express myself and say things you know.

26:55.999 --> 26:59.227
Hey folks, everyone listen up
- Listen up!

26:59.262 --> 27:02.771
We got a high profile kidnapping.
David Ershon, wealthy banker.

27:02.806 --> 27:06.343
Multinational team. Maybe a sleeper
cell, but it's too early to tell.

27:06.378 --> 27:10.543
Hey, Double Baggins, where are
your shoes? Your feet are black.

27:10.578 --> 27:15.481
Who cares? It's not important ok?
- Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

27:15.516 --> 27:19.406
Bye, guys.
- Come on.

27:19.441 --> 27:25.610
This is Don Beaman, an attorney for Mr. Ershon.
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.325
Hey, How are you, son of a bitch?
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:27.360 --> 27:31.365
Take it easy. That's the guy who took our guns, Captain.
- And my shoes.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.739
Wait a minute, did you identify yourselves as police officers?
- What is this?

27:34.774 --> 27:37.394
Allen, tell me, did you?
- No, we did not.

27:37.429 --> 27:40.971
Sorry gentlemen, we thought
you were abducting Mr. Ershon.

27:41.006 --> 27:45.004
It's only protocol.
- Mr. Ershon has agreed to...

27:45.039 --> 27:49.210
correct this scathlic situation. Case is closed.
- I've taken care all the necessary paperwork...

27:49.245 --> 27:52.564
... and you fellas, this point,
you just be glad that Mr. Ershon

27:52.565 --> 27:55.321
is not pressing charges for
an excessive use of force.

27:55.356 --> 27:56.632
Thank you Captain.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.517
Special Forces, right?

28:00.552 --> 28:05.171
Just watch your step, detective. There
are three things I love in this world

28:05.206 --> 28:07.191
Kylie Minogue...

28:07.226 --> 28:11.530
small dimples just above a woman's buttocks.
- Beautiful features.

28:11.565 --> 28:15.836
And the fear in the man's eye who
knows that I 'm about to hurt him.

28:15.871 --> 28:19.619
Hey, shake your dicks. This
pissing contest is over.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.618
Come on.

28:23.218 --> 28:31.297
All right, they return your shoes. And
they return your weapons. Here you go, Terry.

28:32.957 --> 28:36.870
Allen, someone is nice enough to put linseed
oil on it. Some kind of stain on that.

28:36.871 --> 28:40.736
Dark walnut or something. You may wanna
think about dropping them a thank you note.

28:40.771 --> 28:44.653
Ok, you're mad at us, huh, Gene?
- First off, don't call me Gene

28:44.688 --> 28:45.994
I am your Captain.

28:46.029 --> 28:50.783
Guys, do you remember the "be smart speech"?
- Sure.

28:50.818 --> 28:51.396
All right, what did you do?

28:51.431 --> 28:55.874
What did you do about it?
- The opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.

28:55.909 --> 29:00.317
Just Captain. Just Captain. It's not
Captain Gene. I do not have a kitty show.

29:00.352 --> 29:02.433
Sounds creepy, Captain Gene.

29:02.468 --> 29:06.591
Police mistakenly arrest
investment banker David Ershon.

29:06.626 --> 29:10.975
Was he a victim of financial profiling?
- Financial profiling?

29:11.010 --> 29:13.807
That's crazy. He broke the
law and we arrested him.

29:13.842 --> 29:18.376
There wasn't a security tape. He
said, don't let these people take me

29:18.808 --> 29:20.669
I mean when you hear hooves,
you think horses not zebras.

29:20.704 --> 29:25.610
What about donkeys or deer? They have
hooves. What about bovine creatures?

29:25.645 --> 29:30.442
Were you just thinking yourself
a fresh start? - Yeah. - Yeah.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.617
I could see it

29:31.652 --> 29:35.006
Listen, why don't we just go
to my place, talk the case down,

29:35.007 --> 29:37.873
we can have a little dinner
and you can meet Sheila.

29:37.908 --> 29:41.792
Two cops talking down the case while eating food, right? It is not dinner.
- Fine.

29:41.827 --> 29:45.678
And let me apologize in advance ok? In
case my wife acts like a world-class bitch

29:45.713 --> 29:51.360
She is a big ol' broad
and she likes to wield it.

29:51.395 --> 29:56.333
Ok, so I put together a little bio,
complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.

29:56.368 --> 29:59.416
I use uh Adobe Premier
I like to do a weekend

29:59.417 --> 30:02.993
editing recently just cut
3 minutes out of Goodfellas.

30:03.028 --> 30:07.115
David Ershon, is currently
the CEO of Ershon Consortium.

30:07.150 --> 30:10.711
Who is that talking?
- It's a frontline narration app. It's only 99 cents.

30:10.746 --> 30:15.885
Ershon Consortium's current financial
investment exceeds $70 billion

30:15.920 --> 30:17.738
It's largest clients includes
Schering Plough and Lendl Global.

30:17.773 --> 30:20.150
Lendl Global has those TV ads and I
can't figure out what they are doing.

30:20.185 --> 30:23.236
Oil, media, healthcare... You
probably heard their jingle.

30:23.271 --> 30:26.201
Lendl Global with everything...

30:26.236 --> 30:31.039
David Ershon is often found in the company of
Judge Scalia and the lead singer of Maroon 5.

30:31.074 --> 30:34.367
I mean this guy can be connected to
drug cartels. Or black market organ sales

30:34.402 --> 30:37.660
Human trafficking, all of it
- How do you get that from anything I just said?

30:37.695 --> 30:40.263
Hey guys, the soup is on.
- What do you mean?

30:42.466 --> 30:46.867
Hi.. - Hi - You must be Terry.
I'm sorry I've been hiding honey

30:46.902 --> 30:52.618
... but this dinner was tricky. - Who are
you? - I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.

30:52.653 --> 30:55.541
Come on, seriously, who is
that? - His old lady. - Sweetie

30:55.576 --> 30:57.006
It's a workstation.

30:57.041 --> 30:59.867
- Got it.
- You come in here dressed like a hobo

30:59.868 --> 31:03.026
is just distracting
- I know you are working. I am so sorry.

31:03.061 --> 31:04.834
Come on, seriously.

31:04.869 --> 31:08.939
Who is that?
- That's the old ball and chain.

31:08.974 --> 31:11.956
Get over here.

31:11.991 --> 31:13.529
Not right now.
- Ok

31:13.564 --> 31:17.490
Look, they're not all first round pick ok?
- Come on, you're gonna tell me who that is?

31:17.525 --> 31:19.736
Are you really Allen's wife?

31:19.771 --> 31:24.488
Umm I know, people are shocked. Because
he is Episcopalian and I am Catholic...

31:24.523 --> 31:28.917
but, somehow it works.
- Are you gonna change?

31:30.861 --> 31:33.750
I already did.
- It's no big deal. You look really really nice.

31:33.785 --> 31:36.640
Terry, you don't have to be
polite. She looks kind of shitty.

31:36.675 --> 31:38.263
Don't speak to her like that, Allen.

31:38.298 --> 31:41.716
Look, If I put that into my
Cosmo questionnaire, you got a D-

31:41.751 --> 31:46.099
Allen and his abs. He loves them. You
know he has designed three of his own?

31:46.965 --> 31:48.124
One of them, can I tell?

31:48.159 --> 31:53.638
Take a picture of anybody's face and I'll
tell you how the back of his head looks like.

31:53.673 --> 31:56.495
Face back.
- I get some horrible reviews coming out of the Gate.

31:56.530 --> 31:59.318
It's gonna hit. - It's gonna
catch. - Why are you with Allen?

31:59.353 --> 32:02.120
I mean.. That is not what I meant...

32:02.155 --> 32:06.717
How did you guys meet?
- It's a really typical how we met story, Terry.

32:06.752 --> 32:08.852
You'd be bored by it
- I was a dancer for the Knicks...

32:08.887 --> 32:11.253
while finishing my residency
at Columbia Hospital.

32:11.288 --> 32:14.851
Allen came in to the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.
- Yes.

32:14.886 --> 32:17.722
Needless to say, I
fell for him immediately.

32:17.757 --> 32:22.546
It's funny.. It's like a scene from that one
movie, I always forget the name. With Meg Ryan.

32:22.581 --> 32:25.895
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan
met a guy with poison ivy on his ass.

32:25.930 --> 32:29.440
I'll think of it.
- So what about you, Terry?

32:29.475 --> 32:31.641
Do you have a girl?
- I did, yes.

32:31.676 --> 32:34.578
We almost got married but she
backed out. It's complicated.

32:34.613 --> 32:37.445
Terry shot Derek Jeter.
- Shut up, Allen. This was before.

32:37.480 --> 32:41.443
That's okay. - "She's Got Mail", that's
the name of the movie. - That's it!

32:41.478 --> 32:45.408
With Tom Hanks? - And Meg Ryan. - He
didn't have poison ivy up his ass.

32:45.443 --> 32:48.039
Yes, he did.
- Way up there.

32:48.074 --> 32:53.172
Well Terry, can't thank you enough for coming
by. What a wonderful lovely evening, thank you.

32:53.207 --> 32:56.352
It was so so nice meeting today.
- My pleasure. Thank you.

32:56.387 --> 33:00.466
And remember, all I ask of you
is don't let him get hurt, Terry.

33:00.501 --> 33:02.256
She tells me that every
day before I leave.

33:02.291 --> 33:06.083
I do, we come downstairs and make
him his fresh cut strawberries

33:06.118 --> 33:10.062
and I say: Listen my little sugar bowls,
whatever you do today, you just don't get hurt.

33:10.097 --> 33:13.534
Every morning.
- Then I show him my breasts and I say:

33:13.569 --> 33:16.349
These are waiting for
you when you get back home.

33:16.384 --> 33:19.050
You know Terry, they are not the
biggest breasts I've ever seen, but...

33:19.085 --> 33:24.143
They are perky, and they are firm and they are yours.
- You're a nice lady.

33:24.178 --> 33:30.952
Thank you for coming.
- Detective Hoitz and Gamble. Detective Hoitz and Gamble. Over.

33:30.987 --> 33:35.774
We've found your Red Prius. It's
trying to vote for Ralph Nader.

33:35.809 --> 33:37.490
Come on.
- Hey sugar bowls, listen up!

33:37.525 --> 33:39.711
There's gonna be fingerprints
in that car. And tomorrow,

33:39.712 --> 33:41.898
we 're gonna run those
fingerprints through the system.

33:41.933 --> 33:45.609
If we get a hit.. this case is gonna
heat up faster than a junkie spoon.

33:45.644 --> 33:49.286
You do one thing when you wake up
tomorrow... bring it. Thank you, Sheila.

33:49.321 --> 33:51.946
He'll bring it. Good night.
- Good night.

33:51.981 --> 33:54.391
Thank you, Sheila.
- Bye, Terry.

33:54.426 --> 33:55.299
Bye, Sheila.

33:55.334 --> 33:57.350
I will never forget tonight.
- Bye, Terry.

33:57.384 --> 33:59.871
Whatever, go inside. Bye, Sheila.

33:59.906 --> 34:00.886
Bye.
- I see you, Terry.

34:00.921 --> 34:08.297
Bye, Sheila.
- I do not know if he heard me. Bye, Terry.

34:08.297 --> 34:11.179
Bye, Sheila.

34:13.960 --> 34:17.370
Well, here she is. They left her
under an overpass for the night.

34:17.405 --> 34:22.053
Did you find anything?
- Yeah, we found a lot of stuff.

34:22.088 --> 34:25.068
From bodily fluids and hair
samples, we determined that

34:25.069 --> 34:27.940
a bunch of old homeless
dudes had an orgy in the car.

34:27.975 --> 34:28.315
Oh God.

34:28.315 --> 34:32.828
- Yeah, you know what that's called when they
do that in there? It's called a soup kitchen.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.386
It's pretty rough stuff

34:34.725 --> 34:39.753
Not long after that, a mama raccoon
came along, and gave birth on the floor.

34:39.788 --> 34:41.976
What about fingerprints?
You find any fingerprints?

34:42.011 --> 34:44.953
No, couldn't get a one.
- Found a cellphone. - Yeah,

34:44.987 --> 34:47.862
that's mine.
- Any sign of a struggle or...?

34:47.898 --> 34:51.659
No, believe me, everybody who was in
on this orgy was more than willing.

34:51.659 --> 34:54.750
In fact, they left you a note
here.. Thanks for the F-shack.

34:54.784 --> 34:56.813
Love, dirty Mike and the boys.

34:56.848 --> 35:01.257
Here's something we found. We found
about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.

35:01.258 --> 35:04.368
No fingerprints no nothing.
You want to check that out.

35:04.403 --> 35:08.270
It's a real shame you know. I got
myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.

35:08.305 --> 35:09.696
It's my first brand new car.

35:09.731 --> 35:11.082
I never owned a new car.

35:11.253 --> 35:14.931
Watch out, in the back there is a
baby mouse and a used condom. Really gross.

35:15.962 --> 35:18.636
I have a free ticket.

35:18.671 --> 35:21.759
What are we gonna do?
We got no fingerprints...

35:21.794 --> 35:23.281
a bunch of losing lottery tickets...

35:23.282 --> 35:26.504
- Look at this, there was a two minute
phone call made after we were jumped.

35:26.539 --> 35:30.310
They used your phone?
- A ghost dial. Somebody sat on it.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.515
Could've recorded some of the
conversation when Ershon got grabbed.

35:32.550 --> 35:34.144
We can hear the other side of that call.

35:34.179 --> 35:37.390
No, it's nothing.
- Nothing?

35:37.427 --> 35:40.294
It's Nothing! It's Nothing.
- It's the only thing we have! Why did you just get super jumpy?

35:40.329 --> 35:43.290
What? - It is an
ex-girlfriend, ok?

35:43.325 --> 35:48.188
What's the matter? What happened with you guys?
- She was just a bit of a handful. That's it.

35:48.223 --> 35:51.236
Xie xie.
- Here you go.

35:52.943 --> 35:56.654
Allen. The only lead we have, we have to go with
this or we walk away from this case right now.

35:56.689 --> 35:59.136
Fine. Let's go see her.

36:07.915 --> 36:14.528
Hello, Christineth.
- Hello, Allen.

36:14.563 --> 36:19.166
This is my partner, Terry.
- Hi, Terry.

36:19.201 --> 36:23.371
Shit.
- Take it easy.

36:23.406 --> 36:27.610
I waited for you in Tower
Record for four hours!

36:27.645 --> 36:29.897
That was 13 years ago.

36:32.429 --> 36:38.144
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer
alert. Who wants some Arnie Palmies?

36:38.179 --> 36:42.883
Sweetie, this one is the vodka right here.
- Hal, just please sit down please.

36:42.918 --> 36:55.186
All righty.
- I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.

36:55.221 --> 36:56.307
No.

36:56.342 --> 36:58.994
Christineth, it's your husband, it's awkward.
- No, he knows.

36:59.029 --> 37:02.075
You're a lucky dog.
- It's true.

37:02.110 --> 37:09.427
Christina, this is a lovely house.
- It's Christineth, are you stupid or are you deaf?

37:09.462 --> 37:16.701
Christineth! You idiot! You come to
our house, you get my wife's name right!

37:16.736 --> 37:20.522
What?
- Christineth! Look, we really appreciate the hospitality...

37:20.557 --> 37:23.441
and we would love to just get
the message off your cellphone,

37:23.442 --> 37:26.510
we believe it might give us an
information regarding a kidnapping.

37:26.545 --> 37:31.249
Ok, why don't you come
to the kitchen and I will

37:31.250 --> 37:36.144
let you listen to it, and
everyone else stay here.

37:36.179 --> 37:38.687
OK, sweetie.
- Come on.

37:42.768 --> 37:44.666
Oh, there is my phone.
- Great, thank you...

37:45.945 --> 37:51.633
I hate you. Son of a bitch!

37:51.668 --> 38:00.363
What did I ever do? I hate you! I hate you!
You're so adorable, look at your face...

38:00.398 --> 38:06.610
Look at your face. You go: I love
you. Say it! I love you, Christineth.

38:10.082 --> 38:13.958
You probably think because of
the beard that I'm really hairy.

38:13.994 --> 38:14.829
But that's not me.

38:15.653 --> 38:21.603
But uh, I'm not. Shaved.
- Allen!

38:25.669 --> 38:29.732
Allen! Allen! This is police
evidence, Terry, let's go!

38:29.767 --> 38:33.797
Hey! You get back here. You make out my wife.
- Allen!

38:35.830 --> 38:37.471
I don't get it man.

38:37.506 --> 38:40.902
I just do not get it. I mean that
girl was Christineth was seriously hot.

38:40.937 --> 38:42.624
Your wife is crazy hot.

38:42.659 --> 38:47.302
I mean even that Brazilian security chick, she
was... I mean what is it with you and hot ladies?

38:47.337 --> 38:50.712
First off, my wife
is cute, but she's not hot.

38:50.747 --> 38:56.427
Dude, you're insane, your wife is scolding hot.
- Do you want to listen to this message or not?

38:56.462 --> 38:59.670
Whatever.
- You got one job mate, find a sucker...

38:59.705 --> 39:02.716
to invest with you so you can pay
my boss back the money you lost.

39:02.751 --> 39:05.469
I don't care who, I actually
think I found a sucker

39:05.504 --> 39:08.154
They are talking to Ershon.
- To invest 32 billion.

39:08.189 --> 39:12.673
Who's got 32 billion dollars to rob?
- Once I got the money, I'll falsify the records...

39:12.708 --> 39:15.219
to show a massive losses
then you pay your employer.

39:15.909 --> 39:18.625
Now, since you're following me,
I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue

39:18.660 --> 39:22.066
.. and after that 400..
- I told you it wasn't a security team.

39:22.101 --> 39:25.079
He was being abducted.
- Obviously, but what kind of...

39:25.114 --> 39:27.629
Nobody leaves the house,
without making love to my wife!

39:27.630 --> 39:30.056
- Holy shit! Let's go!
- Yeah. He come out of nowhere.

39:30.091 --> 39:34.381
That was 20 miles.
- You get back here!

39:41.863 --> 39:45.040
2300 Park Avenue. The
offices of the lottery.

39:45.075 --> 39:48.208
Holy shit! The lottery tickets we found.

39:48.243 --> 39:52.363
Ershon is using the lottery money to
cover his losses. 32 billion dollars.

39:52.398 --> 39:54.734
That 's the state's money.
- What do we tell Mauch?

39:54.769 --> 39:57.211
The guy lost his money. We
have a sketchy cellphone message

39:57.212 --> 39:58.882
and an address. We're still half a case.

39:59.092 --> 40:01.554
There's got to be some
sort of paper trail.

40:01.555 --> 40:04.760
If we find that, we can track
it. Then we can go Mauch.

40:04.795 --> 40:08.031
So, I did some more research
on Ershon's accounting firm,

40:08.032 --> 40:10.431
and I found some pretty
interesting stuff.

40:10.466 --> 40:15.991
It turns out that Gretchel and
Dawson has... Hold on, I am up...

40:41.938 --> 40:47.889
Gretchel and Dawson accounting firm in Fairlawn,
New Jersey has only one client, David Ershon.

40:47.924 --> 40:50.696
Pretty rinky dink operation
for a guy like that.

40:50.731 --> 40:54.928
Let's go to New Jersey and visit an
accounting firm. That's a shitty day.

41:18.076 --> 41:23.544
Do you have fun singing those songs? They are really depressing.
- I do, they are full of rich history.

41:25.092 --> 41:28.375
Damn it! I'm late, I'm supposed to call my lady.
- I though you said you guys split up?

41:28.410 --> 41:33.062
Let's just keep our thing about work, OK?
- All right, Good bye buddy.

41:33.097 --> 41:34.350
Get off of me, man.

41:52.858 --> 41:59.305
What the hell are you doing? - Dancing Terry, what
the hell are you doing here? - I love you, Francine.

41:59.340 --> 42:03.455
If you were with me, you wouldn't be here in
this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills.

42:03.490 --> 42:08.375
This is a ballet studio, Terry,
OK? These poles are horizontal.

42:08.410 --> 42:11.411
He loves you very much, Francine.
- Who is this guy?

42:11.446 --> 42:14.373
What are you doing here, Allen?
- The code. I'm your partner.

42:14.408 --> 42:17.351
I am here to support a
friend and a work colleague.

42:17.386 --> 42:20.131
Francine, is this guy bothering you?
- Who's this? Your new boyfriend?

42:20.166 --> 42:24.829
Great! You got a new boyfriend.
- He is my dance partner, Terry.

42:24.864 --> 42:29.466
Ok, I know that this is a big surprise but there
are other things in the world besides being a cop

42:29.501 --> 42:37.182
Ok? And if you will excuse me. I'm gonna dance
- You don't think I cannot do this shit? Huh?

42:49.052 --> 42:54.517
That was surprisingly good, Terry.
- I love you, Francine.

42:54.552 --> 42:57.966
You do not know what love is.
- He loves you very much, Francine.

42:58.001 --> 43:00.018
I heard it when he said it, thank you.

43:00.053 --> 43:03.505
You know what you're doing to me? You're
killing me inside, and go light on me man.

43:03.540 --> 43:06.328
You run around like a crack dealing drug addicts.
- Terry!

43:06.363 --> 43:08.998
He's right! It's not a
proof of your behavior.

43:08.999 --> 43:12.754
- Can you please go? And you too
creepy guy, standing in the door?

43:15.061 --> 43:17.073
Let's go Allen.

43:17.108 --> 43:20.718
I think we all experienced
our own ballet today.

43:20.755 --> 43:24.021
A ballet of emotion, feelings.
- You're kind of making things worse.

43:32.729 --> 43:37.446
Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

43:37.481 --> 43:41.084
See, I didn't knew you could dance.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.974
We used to do those dance
moves to make fun of guys

43:42.975 --> 43:44.900
when we were kids. Show
them how queer they were. Ok?

43:46.949 --> 43:49.008
You learn to dance
like that sarcastically?

43:49.009 --> 43:52.471
- Yeah, I guess. Stay out of my
personal life, OK? The kid fly is private.

43:52.506 --> 43:55.687
Stay focus on the case, man.
See you in Jersey tomorrow.

43:55.722 --> 44:01.217
All right, Terry. Hey, That was liberating
for me. I do not know how it felt for you.

44:22.896 --> 44:26.364
Here. Check this out. An
article from six months ago.

44:26.399 --> 44:31.229
It's talking about how the lottery is looking to
invest their 32 billion dollar fund more aggressively.

44:31.264 --> 44:35.873
So he's dealing drugs?
- No! It's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.

44:38.906 --> 44:44.785
Hey, I got you a gift. I just saw
something and I thought of you and so

44:44.820 --> 44:46.782
I do not want it to be weird,
I just want it to be nice.

44:46.817 --> 44:50.162
Of course it's weird, it's a grown
man giving another man a present.

44:51.978 --> 44:53.912
Here we go. Open it up.

44:53.947 --> 44:55.813
It's Ok, you're welcome.

44:55.848 --> 44:59.792
I like to do things like
that. Take a look what it says.

44:59.827 --> 45:05.266
Female Body Inspector.

45:08.497 --> 45:14.892
You know, because we are both in law enforcement,
we both like women, but I got a weird sense of humor.

45:14.927 --> 45:18.961
I'm a sick puppy. I can't look
at it. It makes me laugh so hard.

45:18.996 --> 45:21.094
Me too.

45:23.485 --> 45:25.100
Real nice, you know it's all class.

45:27.641 --> 45:30.756
Ok. - Don't do that shit anymore.
- Yeah. Believe me I won't.

45:30.791 --> 45:33.484
Do you understand what's
so funny about it though?

45:35.798 --> 45:40.122
Because it's the F.B.I., right? It has the same logo,
the same shield and at first glance you're like, oh,...

45:40.157 --> 45:46.674
It's just a mug that says FBI but at the second
glance, you're like, Female Body Inspector?

45:46.709 --> 45:50.259
Get out of town. This is outrageous.
- Shut up!

46:01.700 --> 46:10.300
I am gonna climb over that anger wall of
yours one of these days and it is gonna be glorious.

46:10.335 --> 46:15.338
Shouldn't we tell Mauch, that uh we are checking this place out?
- For what? We're just going to check it out.

46:15.373 --> 46:19.088
No, but it's procedure.
- Terry answers to no one.

46:19.123 --> 46:21.141
I do what I do.

46:21.176 --> 46:26.075
What accounting firm is
closed at 11 am on a Tuesday?

46:26.110 --> 46:27.251
This is a shithole.

46:33.795 --> 46:37.175
I love bombs.
- I can't hear.

46:40.602 --> 46:42.860
There are blood blisters on my hands.

46:43.484 --> 46:48.313
Oh God, how do they walk away in movies without
fuzzy with an explosion behind them? No way!

46:48.348 --> 46:50.164
Cop's bullshit. All that.

46:50.199 --> 46:55.582
When they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of
the Death Star, it was followed by explosion...

46:55.617 --> 47:00.965
That was bullshit.
- Don't you dare badmouth Star Wars. That was all accurate.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.391
I need an MRI! I have
got soft tissue damage.

47:05.426 --> 47:09.747
There's no way I don't
have soft tissue damage.

47:09.782 --> 47:13.416
I just want to go somewhere
and breastfeed right now.

47:16.454 --> 47:19.734
Firemen thought it was a gas
leak, but no way! It was timed!

47:19.769 --> 47:24.051
They don't want to kill us but they want to scare us.
- O yeah, well, they succeeded, ok?

47:24.086 --> 47:25.828
I'm tired of this.

47:25.863 --> 47:31.272
Right? I am tired of explosions and people
pointing guns at me. I want to go back to my desk.

47:31.307 --> 47:35.372
Guess what? Life gets loud
sometimes and messes with your ears.

47:35.407 --> 47:37.703
You can't escape it by hiding
in your desk your whole life!

47:37.738 --> 47:42.938
You know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for
years. Ok? There is no explosions at my desk.

47:42.973 --> 47:48.063
There is no explosions at my home
with my plain wife in my plain house.

47:49.686 --> 47:51.668
What are you afraid of man?

47:51.703 --> 47:55.751
I'm your partner. You can tell me.
What the hell are you hiding from?

47:57.380 --> 48:00.000
I was a sophomore in college.

48:00.035 --> 48:05.185
University I went to decided
they needed to raise tuition.

48:05.220 --> 48:13.932
A classmate of mine, Brenda, in effort to raise
money, and stay in school came up with a nifty plan..

48:13.967 --> 48:17.215
where she thought she dates
guys and charge them money.

48:17.250 --> 48:19.897
I go out all the time with the
whole bunch of you know boys.

48:19.932 --> 48:24.355
And I kinda need somebody to help me
out Like, you know, my partner in crime.

48:24.390 --> 48:28.580
Yeah, I can make a schedule.
- Yeah yeah yeah, that what I was thinking.

48:28.615 --> 48:29.868
Transportation services.

48:29.903 --> 48:32.449
Yeah. yeah. We'd be a good
friend - Thanks so much.

48:32.450 --> 48:35.231
She said she needed my help
to make sure the dates went ok,

48:35.266 --> 48:38.501
that the guys paid her. She
said she'd give me a percentage.

48:38.536 --> 48:41.843
Oh my god, you were a pimp.
- What? God, no.

48:41.878 --> 48:43.819
No, just trying to help a friend.

48:43.854 --> 48:45.763
We started making a lot of money.

48:48.601 --> 48:52.195
Before you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends
decided they wanted to be a part of it.

48:53.501 --> 48:57.152
Pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that
I was protecting while they gave me money.

48:57.187 --> 48:59.381
That's called the stable horse.

49:00.097 --> 49:01.436
They decided I shouldn’t
use my real name

49:01.471 --> 49:06.244
so we came up with the name Gator.
- I'm telling you, you were a pimp.

49:06.279 --> 49:08.560
No, are you even listening to the story?

49:09.945 --> 49:14.979
Anyway, one day I wake up and I look in
the mirror and I don't like what I see.

49:15.014 --> 49:20.823
I mean, I have gotten out of control
and I didn't even realize that.

49:20.858 --> 49:22.823
You can't have a
conscience in the pimp game.

49:23.681 --> 49:26.345
One night, two of my favorite
girls, Candy and Jolene,

49:26.346 --> 49:29.928
said, We got to take you in, they
dropped me off to the Emergency Room...

49:29.963 --> 49:32.123
... that's where I met
Sheila, I was a mess.

49:32.158 --> 49:36.079
I made a promise to myself and to her, that
I would never get out of control again...

49:37.656 --> 49:41.621
So soon as I graduate from College, I became
an accountant for the police department.

49:41.656 --> 49:45.546
The most stable job I could think of.

49:45.581 --> 49:49.401
An accountant for law and order.

49:49.436 --> 49:54.128
I just don't want to ever feel
out of control like that ever again.

49:54.163 --> 49:57.376
Don't worry. I got your back.

49:57.411 --> 50:02.325
I say we get Ershon grilled and see if he
cracks. I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around.

50:02.360 --> 50:03.047
Ok.

50:04.684 --> 50:08.574
You can either walk the plan or take
your panties off. The choice is yours.

50:08.609 --> 50:12.426
You want to take my panties off?
- You made a wise choice.

50:12.427 --> 50:16.721
- Mr. Ershon, detective Gamble and the
officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.

50:16.756 --> 50:19.122
Gentlemen, please.

50:19.157 --> 50:20.863
Remember us, hot shot?

50:20.898 --> 50:22.571
Of course I do, please sit.

50:26.783 --> 50:29.432
Two of those... water please
No lime wedges, just cucumber.

50:29.467 --> 50:32.628
Guess where we just came from? An
explosion at your accounting office.

50:32.663 --> 50:39.004
It's an awful gas leak.
- Gas leak? The only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.

50:39.039 --> 50:43.630
I just thank God no one was
hurt, or injured in a bad way.

50:43.665 --> 50:49.715
I absolutely appal death.
- Hey Andrew Lloyd Webber, the jig is up, ok?

50:49.750 --> 50:52.252
You know there wasn't any
security team that grabbed you,

50:52.253 --> 50:54.495
we know you're targeting
a big fish to cover losses.

50:54.530 --> 50:56.975
You talk or I beat you so
we don't show no bruises.

50:57.010 --> 50:58.409
God, this water is good.

50:58.444 --> 50:59.614
Terry, have you tried the water?

50:59.649 --> 51:00.640
Shut up, Allen.

51:00.675 --> 51:04.839
I assure you, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

51:04.874 --> 51:08.015
I understand there's a bit of a mixed-up
with the whole scaffolding business.

51:08.050 --> 51:14.853
The cucumber accents the
water in such a way that...

51:14.888 --> 51:21.436
Perhaps, by a way of apology, I can offer you my
personal court side seats for the Knicks game with...

51:21.471 --> 51:22.928
... access to the Ambassador club.

51:25.500 --> 51:31.521
Come on, Knicks! Come on! I
got Knicks' fever. Catch him.

51:31.556 --> 51:37.109
Hey, it feels weird sitting here. Feels like it is a bribe.
- It is a bribe.

51:37.144 --> 51:39.900
Son of a bitch! That's a
court side and I went blind.

51:39.935 --> 51:43.490
Come on!
- Call me!

51:45.584 --> 51:47.272
That was a trick!
- No more.

51:47.307 --> 51:53.162
Gentlemen, you have a choice,
Mamma mia or Jersey boys...

51:58.213 --> 51:59.512
Fantastic! Unbelievable!

52:04.543 --> 52:05.667
Damn it! He did it again.

52:08.092 --> 52:11.306
No more tickets!
- Sorry sir, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.

52:11.307 --> 52:14.387
- That's ok, Susan, uh, two glacier
water with Mediterranean lime...

52:14.422 --> 52:17.842
No no, No more water! We're not here for that.
- I was very much looking forward to having the water.

52:17.877 --> 52:20.908
How great is Jersey Boys?
- It's not great.

52:20.943 --> 52:23.905
It's fantastic. You totally undersold it.

52:23.940 --> 52:26.805
The pageantry, the
costumes. Wow! What a musical.

52:26.840 --> 52:29.089
Hey, get over here.

52:31.599 --> 52:31.599
What's wrong with you?
It's not what we're here for

52:31.634 --> 52:34.810
We are gonna do good cop, bad cop.

52:34.845 --> 52:38.655
Ok? The oldest game in the
book for a reason. It works.

52:38.690 --> 52:40.419
I'd come strong and you come in.

52:40.454 --> 52:43.821
I'm strong and you come in, got it?
- Got it.

52:43.856 --> 52:48.072
Hey you listen to me, you piece of shit. It's
just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart.

52:48.107 --> 52:51.912
How did you cover your losses, huh? What
drug cartel are you working with now?

52:51.947 --> 52:55.717
Ok, wait wait.. I'll talk to you. You're reasonable.
- No no. Look at me!

52:55.752 --> 52:57.614
Yup, you want to talk to me?

52:59.410 --> 53:00.256
Allen, what are you doing?

53:00.291 --> 53:05.340
I'm gonna make you a plate of human shit.

53:05.375 --> 53:07.011
Get away from me.

53:15.991 --> 53:17.667
Look, I'm really sorry
about that. I just uh...

53:17.702 --> 53:23.521
I saw how aggressive you were being and I thought,
Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that, since

53:23.556 --> 53:24.759
we are doing bad cop, bad cop.

53:24.794 --> 53:27.721
What? No, I said good cop, bad cop.

53:27.756 --> 53:31.154
I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.
- Ok, then there it is, that's it.

53:31.189 --> 53:34.045
I thought you said bad cop, bad cop.

53:34.080 --> 53:36.679
While you were going crazy, look
what I snatched from his desk.

53:36.714 --> 53:39.585
I think it's his phone sheet.
- Oh nice!

53:39.620 --> 53:41.740
Seven calls to the lottery office.

53:41.775 --> 53:43.453
That would be the evidence we need for Mauch.
- Yeah.

53:45.298 --> 53:48.842
Get back!, Colombian drug lords.
- Where are you getting that from?

54:00.405 --> 54:02.588
Can you imagine where you’d be in
your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?

54:03.847 --> 54:03.847
Move!

54:10.263 --> 54:12.970
We call this in, right?
- Looks like we got all the evidence we need.

54:13.005 --> 54:14.569
I'm sorry, my butterfly.

54:16.298 --> 54:19.336
Load them up and send them back to...

54:27.534 --> 54:32.299
Shit! - What? - What
do you mean what?

54:32.334 --> 54:33.511
Where are we?

54:33.546 --> 54:36.206
We are in the high desert.

54:36.241 --> 54:39.906
They took my shoes again man. What
the hell is it with taking shoes?

54:39.941 --> 54:41.378
They took your wooden gun?
- Yeah.

54:47.406 --> 54:51.318
Hello!
- Hello, Gene... I mean.. Captain, Captain, it's Allen Gamble.

54:51.353 --> 54:53.354
Yeah yeah, where are
you? What's going on?

54:53.389 --> 54:57.285
Captain, it's a long story but I am just
gonna cut to the chase. We are in Las Vegas.

54:57.320 --> 55:01.146
All right, we were, we were kidnapped,
put on a freight train and shipped out here.

55:01.181 --> 55:05.636
Let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.
- Captain, I am being straight with you. Look.

55:05.671 --> 55:10.091
We think something is going on, ok? We think
Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.

55:10.126 --> 55:15.680
How many times that I explicitly
say to you: Lay off Ershon!

55:15.715 --> 55:18.943
Terry, Captain wants to know how many
times he asked us to lay off Ershon.

55:18.978 --> 55:22.652
Twice.
- Twice. Terry says twice. I agree.

55:22.687 --> 55:23.653
I'm hanging up. I am done.

55:27.995 --> 55:32.913
I got to tell you I am starting for get
a hand to that... a taste for that pie girl.

55:32.948 --> 55:39.922
Martin and Fossi, super cops. - In three,
two,... We busted that junkie... - Uh huh.

55:39.957 --> 55:46.073
Got back 74,000 diamonds. 74,000.
- Boom. - Solved the Castian case.

55:46.108 --> 55:50.944
74,000? Dollars? That's all they took? There
is millions of dollars of diamonds in there.

55:50.945 --> 55:53.528
- How about this? How
about you shut your face?

55:53.563 --> 55:58.123
All right? Just shut it
- Hoitz. Gamble. Captain's looking for you.

55:59.570 --> 56:03.893
Captain? - Yeah?
- Is it a bad time? - No.

56:03.928 --> 56:07.629
Come on, come on. - Not
me right? - Yes, and you.

56:07.664 --> 56:13.075
Fellas, I'm sure you're uh familiar with the
venerable DA Radford, he come to pay us some visit.

56:13.110 --> 56:17.101
Hello gentlemen. - Hello sir. - Hey.
- You know I was talking to Gene here.

56:17.212 --> 56:22.099
He prefers Captain.
- Yes, I was talking to Gene here and you know what's funny?

56:22.134 --> 56:24.404
I don't know what you
two have been up to,

56:24.405 --> 56:28.047
but I've been getting calls from
people I don't ever get called from.

56:28.082 --> 56:33.463
In 40 years, I've been enforcing the law,
I've learnt one thing. When that happens. Stop.

56:33.498 --> 56:37.776
Gene, how's the family?
- Good, Louis. Thanks for asking.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.379
My son is bisexual.
- Tremendous.

56:41.446 --> 56:46.135
Gentlemen, do we understand
each other? Cut the crap!

56:46.170 --> 56:46.927
Will do.

56:48.928 --> 56:55.065
That guy never comes down here. 20 years,
I think I've seen that guy only one time.

56:55.100 --> 56:58.343
He is a headway cap, that guy.
- He was sitting right here.

56:58.378 --> 57:01.166
Yeah. I think you miss
the point. Anyway, look,

57:01.167 --> 57:04.650
blue and white found your
firearms down by the Hudson River.

57:04.685 --> 57:10.546
Here you go Terry. You know what?
I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.

57:10.581 --> 57:12.721
To give me back my real gun?
- No.

57:12.756 --> 57:16.477
We're going to give you
this. It's a rape whistle.

57:16.512 --> 57:21.982
You blow that if you're in any trouble. Someone
with an actual gun will come and help you out.

57:22.017 --> 57:27.417
We were abducted, Captain. This shit is real.
Ershon is dirty, he's targeting the lottery!

57:27.452 --> 57:30.396
Next, I want you guys to
hand in all the evidence,

57:30.397 --> 57:34.204
you think you have to the S.E.C.
That's under their jurisdiction.

57:34.239 --> 57:39.615
Don't you get it? This case is talking to us. I'm a
peacock, Captain. You got to let me fly on this one.

57:39.650 --> 57:41.299
You know what Terry?
Let's just settle this

57:41.334 --> 57:45.818
Peacocks don't fly. - They fly a little. They
got a real running start. - As much as a penguin.

57:45.853 --> 57:49.091
One more thing, do me a favor.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

57:49.092 --> 57:52.543
Is that an accident or you're
trying to quote TLC on purpose?

57:52.578 --> 57:56.136
I don't even understand your reference.
- You don't understand what you said?

57:56.171 --> 57:59.923
I don't know what that is, get out.
- Whatever.

58:09.116 --> 58:09.975
How did they got that story?

58:11.850 --> 58:16.148
I'm tired of being treated like a
jerk for trying to do the right thing.

58:16.183 --> 58:20.448
Hey guys, there is a proxy vote for
big reinvestment bit, pension coming up.

58:20.483 --> 58:21.962
So, if you just wanna come by...
- Damn it, Bob.

58:21.997 --> 58:26.586
Let me ask you something. What do you even
do around here besides interrupt people?

58:26.621 --> 58:32.629
Well, I served as a treasurer for
the union I make a pot of decaf.

58:32.664 --> 58:35.682
Exactly, you're a
worthless piece of shit.

58:35.717 --> 58:41.004
You're probably right, Terry. It's
why I feel so sad all the time.

58:41.039 --> 58:44.431
I'm gonna go for a walk.
- Say something.

58:44.466 --> 58:47.824
Come on, Bob. I didn't
mean it, all right?

58:47.859 --> 58:49.578
I'm upset.

59:03.497 --> 59:06.456
These roast ribs taste like a dog's asshole.
- Honey!

59:06.491 --> 59:11.984
I'm sitting here thinking, who in the world would slow
roast a dog's asshole and serve it to their husband?

59:12.019 --> 59:14.515
You would.
- You're being awful.

59:14.552 --> 59:17.380
What's wrong?
- Captain took us off the case.

59:17.415 --> 59:20.358
I am sorry.

59:20.393 --> 59:23.884
I told Terry about my dark
days in college and I...

59:23.919 --> 59:28.984
it brought up some feelings.
- Honey, that was a long time ago.

59:29.019 --> 59:31.588
You are not that same person anymore.

59:31.623 --> 59:37.152
You don't get it. There's a darkness inside of
me. It wants to get out and wants to walk around.

59:37.187 --> 59:40.768
It wants some walking around money
and it wants to buy some shoes...

59:40.803 --> 59:45.306
and it wants to walk up to the people
and say Hey, Gator don't play no shit!

59:45.341 --> 59:49.890
You hit you feel me? Gator never been
about that never been about playing no shit!

59:53.819 --> 59:54.731
Sweetie, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

59:56.917 --> 59:58.757
Remember that night we met?

01:00:00.113 --> 01:00:04.831
The attending physician told me: We
have a drugged out pimp in the back.

01:00:04.866 --> 01:00:08.447
And I went back there and
I pulled open that curtain...

01:00:08.482 --> 01:00:11.909
and I saw you. You were weak.

01:00:11.944 --> 01:00:21.376
Scared, ass-up, enflamed, crying and at
that moment I knew, Hey, he's no pimp.

01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:25.134
Pimps don't cry.

01:00:25.169 --> 01:00:28.822
Pimps don't cry...

01:00:28.857 --> 01:00:34.674
Pimps don't cry... No they don't.

01:00:34.709 --> 01:00:41.228
They don't shed a
tear. Pimps don't cry...

01:00:41.265 --> 01:00:46.560
They never shed a tear.

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:53.414
Come lay with me and be safe
and let's make love. Come on.

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:58.239
Every time you say 'be safe'. It tears me
apart. You got to let me be who I'm gonna be.

01:00:58.274 --> 01:01:02.224
Allen, I'm pregnant.

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:06.177
Whose baby is that? Who's
the man who did that to you?

01:01:06.212 --> 01:01:08.299
Gator's bitches better
be using the jimmies.

01:01:08.334 --> 01:01:13.108
I am sorry. See, that's
what I am talking about.

01:01:13.143 --> 01:01:18.447
Oh my God, you need to leave. Get out!

01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:20.170
Get out, Allen.

01:01:20.205 --> 01:01:22.950
Get out!

01:01:37.807 --> 01:01:48.299
Hey. - Hey. - What are you doing here? When I have
lady troubles, I usually come here almost every night.

01:01:48.334 --> 01:01:49.981
What are you doing here?

01:01:51.713 --> 01:01:53.786
Sheila and I got into it tonight.

01:01:53.821 --> 01:01:56.392
She threw me out.

01:01:57.586 --> 01:02:01.478
You’re not a cop until you’re
thrown out of the house, partner.

01:02:01.513 --> 01:02:05.316
Does it bother you that the Castian
robbery only took $74,000 of diamonds?

01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:07.236
They are junkies. Who cares.

01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:11.219
No junkie can go down
a 20-story zip line.

01:02:12.507 --> 01:02:13.544
Hey fellas, how are you doing?

01:02:13.579 --> 01:02:18.342
We are about to have us a little scoop party in
the red Prius over here if you want to join us.

01:02:18.377 --> 01:02:21.533
Are you Dirty Mike and the boys?
- How do you know who we are?

01:02:21.568 --> 01:02:24.000
You left a note in that car.
- Police, shithead.

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:28.283
They are cops. We gotta go. Come on!
Hey, peace shitboys. They're cops.

01:02:28.318 --> 01:02:30.747
You turned my beautiful
Prius into a nightmare.

01:02:30.782 --> 01:02:33.932
We are gonna have sex in your
car. It will happen again.

01:02:34.945 --> 01:02:41.336
I don't know where I am gonna sleep tonight.
- Depend on what you're gonna be drinking. Jack of all trades.

01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:43.669
Drinks on me, come on.
- No, I already have a beer.

01:02:43.704 --> 01:02:48.245
No no no, I'm talking about doing some
serious drinking. Drink with Terry Hoitz.

01:03:34.884 --> 01:03:38.877
It's kind a sucks man. We worked our ass off on
this case, now we got to hand over all the evidence?

01:03:38.912 --> 01:03:41.746
Yeah. That is not right.
- Oh my god, I'm hung-over.

01:03:43.546 --> 01:03:45.623
You guys in law enforcement?

01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:49.634
Yeah, we are an independent government agency who
longed with the F.B.I and the Federal Reserves...

01:03:49.669 --> 01:03:52.283
regulate stock markets
and corporate fraud.

01:03:52.318 --> 01:03:54.861
And the Federal Reserve is the prison?

01:03:54.896 --> 01:03:58.896
No, basically it is a held for profit bank that
sets interest rates and moves money to other banks.

01:03:58.931 --> 01:04:01.031
Is that a waste basket?
- Yes, right there.

01:04:01.066 --> 01:04:02.050
Thank you.

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:05.040
You, all right?

01:04:09.432 --> 01:04:15.916
I am sorry. I got so drunk last night I think I
thought a tube of toothpaste was astronaut food.

01:04:17.166 --> 01:04:19.308
Come on in, fellas.

01:04:20.219 --> 01:04:22.257
You gotta be kidding me.
You're Ershon's lawyer.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.260
We are turning over our
investigation to you?

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:28.054
Let me assure you, there will be no conflict
of interest between me and David Ershon.

01:04:28.089 --> 01:04:32.388
And if this were an actual investigation,
I would immediately recuse myself.

01:04:32.423 --> 01:04:36.449
This is all the evidence we have I
truly hope you take this seriously.

01:04:36.484 --> 01:04:38.045
Yes, very much so.

01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:41.931
From everything I've heard I understand that you
guys are the best in these types of investigations.

01:04:41.966 --> 01:04:46.998
Outside of Enron and
A.I.G. and Bernie Madoff.

01:04:47.033 --> 01:04:52.159
Worldcom. Bear Sterns. Lehman Brothers.
- Ok, Thank you. Thank you, detective.

01:04:52.194 --> 01:04:53.906
Would you like a sit?
- No, I'm good. - Ok.

01:04:53.941 --> 01:04:58.075
Let me just assure you, fellas,
David Ershon is an upstanding citizen.

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:02.015
I'm playing squash with him tonight
at the club, and we're having dinner.

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:05.597
You listen to me you wisenut wimp
monkey. You play squash with Ershon right?

01:05:05.632 --> 01:05:09.111
Your kids going to school with his?
How do you know if he's clean or not?

01:05:09.146 --> 01:05:13.236
I will take a look at your evidence, and I
will take a second look at their financials.

01:05:13.271 --> 01:05:17.325
And when I come back, bust your ass, we're
locking David Ershon in the Federal Reserve.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.301
He still don't understand the concept.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:40.287
What are you doing?

01:05:41.168 --> 01:05:44.424
We just handed all of our evidence
over to the bad guys' lawyer.

01:05:44.459 --> 01:05:47.717
Are you a big man? I am talking to you.

01:05:47.752 --> 01:05:50.684
What? - You wake up in the morning and
decided to put your big boy pants?

01:05:50.719 --> 01:05:54.010
Look, I'm wearing a belt.
I got big boy pants on.

01:05:54.888 --> 01:05:56.323
Stop.
- We don't do that.

01:05:56.497 --> 01:05:59.502
You're scaring the shit out of me man. Stop it.
- Is that how you conduct yourself?

01:05:59.537 --> 01:06:02.278
In a democracy?
- What the hell are you doing man?

01:06:02.313 --> 01:06:07.649
I'm so tired of you getting
angry and yelling all the time.

01:06:07.684 --> 01:06:09.703
It's exhausting.

01:06:11.659 --> 01:06:16.079
It's like I'm partner with the Hulk.
- You wanna know why I'm so angry all the time?

01:06:16.114 --> 01:06:19.429
Because the more I try to do
right, the more I screw things up.

01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:25.563
We've got a possible jumper at 3
World Financial Center, 23rd floor.

01:06:25.598 --> 01:06:28.905
All units, Firemen en route.
- The S.E.C.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.173
Beaman's office.
- We have to go.

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:33.371
But the Captain..
- We have to go.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:37.692
All units, I need a respond, possible
jumper, 3 World Financial Center.

01:06:47.218 --> 01:06:53.642
Shit! Beaman. He's got to know something.
- Wesley.

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:56.352
Detective Hoitz and Gamble, we got this.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:59.677
I took an online class at University
of Phoenix on negotiating...

01:06:59.712 --> 01:07:01.127
I'm gonna need a priest and a bullhorn.

01:07:01.162 --> 01:07:03.379
We got no bullhorn.
- Does anyone have a bullhorn?

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.399
Hey, police business, I need to use your P.A. system.
- Ok, let me turn it on.

01:07:10.434 --> 01:07:14.393
Mr. Beaman?
- ... - Wesley

01:07:14.428 --> 01:07:18.316
I know Ershon's Wesley.

01:07:18.351 --> 01:07:20.857
There is a lot to live for in this life.

01:07:20.892 --> 01:07:27.482
Lot of great days like uh soda pop, fresh can of soda pop.
- I do not care.

01:07:27.517 --> 01:07:29.634
Give me that. I know how to talk to him.

01:07:29.669 --> 01:07:33.938
Listen, we all know that you're
scumbag and nobody cares about you.

01:07:33.973 --> 01:07:38.297
That's worse than what I was saying.
I'm not going to lie to you, Don.

01:07:38.332 --> 01:07:42.620
People down here started to murmur
that you don't have the balls to do it.

01:07:42.655 --> 01:07:46.502
I don't care.
- Yeah, I say you can do it.

01:07:46.537 --> 01:07:51.336
I mean I don't want you to
jump but you have the capability.

01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:53.539
Oh look he's flying.

01:07:56.389 --> 01:07:58.776
Stop it.

01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:03.835
Half empty bottle of gin, chair knocked over,
look at this, it's a clear sign of struggle.

01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:06.369
Make sure you got this, all right?
- Detectives.

01:08:06.404 --> 01:08:10.215
All your work is done here. You can go.
- What about Ershon targeting the lottery?

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:13.935
You know why Ershon was calling down
to the lottery office all those times?

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:18.170
He's got to be hooking up with the Powerball
girl. She was on TV with all the numbered balls.

01:08:18.205 --> 01:08:20.832
Yeah, she filed a restraining
order on him last week.

01:08:20.867 --> 01:08:24.721
It was right there in front of you the
whole time. You guys are getting transferred.

01:08:24.756 --> 01:08:26.259
What?
- Traffic.

01:08:26.294 --> 01:08:32.734
Yeah, that's right. You, you gonna walk a beep
downtown. You gonna walk a beep downtown. It's done.

01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:34.482
- But Captain?
- No no no, it's done.

01:08:34.517 --> 01:08:36.160
Save yourself some gas.
- Captain!

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:39.197
Is there an appeal process we can..?
- Got to do what you got to do Captain.

01:08:39.232 --> 01:08:42.913
Ouch.
- Wow. That hurt.

01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:49.377
Excuse me? Where's my car?
- They towed it. A couple of homeless people were messing around in it.

01:08:49.412 --> 01:08:52.756
That's an official police car.
- You could've fooled me.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.830
Mauch is upset huh?
- Really?

01:09:00.865 --> 01:09:04.337
The only thing I had to be proud of in my
life was being a detective that was all I had.

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:05.261
Now it's gone.

01:09:05.296 --> 01:09:11.560
I know, you still got me.
- Don't you get it? I don't want you Allen. Ok?

01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:14.469
I never did. I told you that
scaffolding violation was dogshit.

01:09:14.504 --> 01:09:17.341
I can't believe you still doubt
me, after everything we've seen

01:09:17.377 --> 01:09:19.407
it is a real case and I'm a real cop.

01:09:19.442 --> 01:09:21.403
We just got the wrong target for Ershon.

01:09:21.438 --> 01:09:23.792
You carry a rape whistle.
- This is real cop work.

01:09:23.828 --> 01:09:26.113
There's nothing about you
that makes a man a man.

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:30.227
Ok? You got no gun, no car, no
wife and now you got no partner.

01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:30.988
Leave me alone.

01:09:31.023 --> 01:09:36.375
A mud case.
- Terry, I'm a cop, for your information, ok?

01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:39.184
A broken partnership.
- I'm a cop.

01:09:39.219 --> 01:09:46.000
And getting busted down to a shitty
assignment. Allen and Terry hit the trifecta.

01:09:46.035 --> 01:09:51.609
But sometimes when you
get your ass kicked...

01:09:51.644 --> 01:09:55.121
that's when you find that what's real.

01:09:55.156 --> 01:09:59.213
And what needs doing.

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:07.001
Whether it's directing traffic...

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:11.162
or cracking a multi billion dollar fraud.

01:10:22.755 --> 01:10:25.418
Do you work here?
- Yes, I do.

01:10:25.453 --> 01:10:29.537
The wrecking ball, the crash in the Castian down
there, they don't send the damage to your office?

01:10:29.572 --> 01:10:32.079
Some police officers
came by and shield it off.

01:10:32.114 --> 01:10:33.498
You know what they look like?

01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:39.832
One of them had an Australian accent.
- You don't happen to do any business with the state lottery, do you?

01:10:39.867 --> 01:10:45.130
No, my main client is Lendl Global.
Can I ask what is this about?

01:10:57.917 --> 01:11:00.466
Gator needs his gag, you punk ass bitch!

01:11:09.903 --> 01:11:11.404
Because that's what a real cop is.

01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:13.834
I never said to lock her up.

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:16.021
A guy who does what needs to be done.

01:11:16.056 --> 01:11:19.945
A guy who knows how to
use dark side for good.

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:21.999
And then you move to Florida.

01:11:31.347 --> 01:11:34.361
One, two, three, attack.
- Whoa!

01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:37.341
It's me, Allen.
- Tap on. Tap on.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:40.655
Are you tapping off? You're hitting me in the face.
- I'm tapping it off.

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:42.972
Are you crazy?

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:47.462
What are you doing man? I almost killed you.
- Turn off the lights.

01:11:47.497 --> 01:11:49.318
What?
- They should be watching us.

01:11:49.353 --> 01:11:51.103
Who?
- I found some great information.

01:11:51.138 --> 01:11:54.849
About what?
- Some scary shit Terry, this is big.

01:11:54.884 --> 01:11:56.686
How did you get in here?

01:11:56.721 --> 01:11:59.740
We cannot be too careful.
- What are you talking about?

01:11:59.775 --> 01:12:02.758
This house might be bugged.
- There's no bugs in here.

01:12:02.793 --> 01:12:10.906
First off, I missed you.
- What's going on?

01:12:10.941 --> 01:12:15.808
Did you hear what I said?
- Fine, I kind a missed you too.

01:12:15.843 --> 01:12:20.640
Thank you. I've found out
whose losses Ershon has to cover.

01:12:20.675 --> 01:12:25.495
It's Lendl Global.
- What? Lendl staged the Castian robbery as a distraction

01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:28.188
so they can break into their
own accounting firm next door.

01:12:28.223 --> 01:12:34.695
They did alter all the records to cover the losses that
Ershon had cost them through all these bad investments.

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:36.376
You're not supposed to be doing this.

01:12:36.411 --> 01:12:37.990
You're supposed to be walking the beat.

01:12:38.025 --> 01:12:42.271
I know. Pretty tricky though, huh?
- This is bad, Allen.

01:12:42.306 --> 01:12:45.653
This is bad, no wonder the Captain
wanted us to stay out of this.

01:12:45.688 --> 01:12:48.964
I bet Beaman started asking question
and that's why they killed him.

01:12:48.999 --> 01:12:54.187
You see, tomorrow, there's a massive
business deal going down Ershon's leading it.

01:12:54.222 --> 01:12:58.243
Let's go tap the ground who the poor sucker
they're making the deal with, but we got to stop it.

01:12:58.278 --> 01:13:03.080
It's about time the peacock fly.
- I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.

01:13:03.115 --> 01:13:07.063
So do I. We're cops.
- No, I like what I do now.

01:13:07.098 --> 01:13:11.140
I like working traffic, it's a great gig.
- What?

01:13:11.175 --> 01:13:15.185
I like working traffic,
I am not going with you.

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:17.708
Traffic? Bullshit.

01:13:21.472 --> 01:13:23.767
What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about my life.

01:13:23.802 --> 01:13:28.901
The corner around the 54th and third
Avenue, it hums. It is Terry's intersection.

01:13:28.936 --> 01:13:31.013
And the traffic guys,
they are good guys.

01:13:31.048 --> 01:13:35.689
There's one guy, Phillip, he can pee in the urinal
from twenty feet. You got to see it Allen, you got to.

01:13:35.724 --> 01:13:38.082
What happened to you? What
happened to this being our time?

01:13:38.117 --> 01:13:40.027
No way Allen. I am out I'm done.

01:13:40.062 --> 01:13:43.577
Get in the car.
- Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.

01:13:45.571 --> 01:13:48.848
Apartment pop, now get in the car.
- You are not gonna shoot me.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:52.965
Ok, I'll be honest. This is the second time I ever fired this.
- So stop pointing it at me.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.361
Look, tomorrow morning all I know is I am going to Mauch, all right?
- Or what? He doesn't care.

01:13:58.396 --> 01:14:00.463
He's been dodging this
case for too long and

01:14:00.464 --> 01:14:03.494
I want answers. I want him to
look me in the eye and tell me why.

01:14:03.529 --> 01:14:08.271
Turn on the news man, nobody cares.
- I hope I'm not alone.

01:14:08.306 --> 01:14:10.256
Hope you bring it.

01:14:13.137 --> 01:14:17.226
We have big day out there. Big one. We
got a full moon. People are gonna be amped.

01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:20.647
All right? Let's see what we've
got on hot tips, all right?

01:14:20.682 --> 01:14:24.177
The new bath mats are in.

01:14:24.212 --> 01:14:28.720
One more thing. We got a
serial rapist in Crown Heights.

01:14:28.755 --> 01:14:33.542
That’s for my other job.
Ignore that, forget it.

01:14:33.578 --> 01:14:37.830
Well don't ignore it, if you live in
Crown Heights. You know, walk in pairs.

01:14:37.865 --> 01:14:44.988
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
- Ok. I got to go. Go get them. Let's be careful out there.

01:14:48.224 --> 01:14:52.849
I would like to keep the oak together,
and the maples separately, ok?

01:14:52.884 --> 01:14:54.253
And this chopping boards...
- Hey Captain!

01:14:54.288 --> 01:14:58.987
Hey Allen, hey, how are you
doing? What are you doing here?

01:14:59.022 --> 01:15:01.627
Are you here for the bath mats?
- I need you to be straight with me.

01:15:01.662 --> 01:15:03.286
Or, straight with us.
- Terry. Watch this now.

01:15:03.321 --> 01:15:06.978
You could work in traffic today.
- Hey, Terry, look at this.

01:15:07.013 --> 01:15:10.465
I thought you're working traffic today?
- Got them blocked

01:15:10.466 --> 01:15:13.682
the box. Besides, the partner's code, right?
- Thanks.

01:15:13.717 --> 01:15:18.167
Why have you worked your ass
off trying to kill this case?

01:15:18.202 --> 01:15:24.339
All right, fine! I'm gonna tell you guys something.
You've really went into deep water on this one.

01:15:24.374 --> 01:15:27.737
You've really went deep. Ershon's
connected with all higher ups.

01:15:27.772 --> 01:15:30.840
And I gotta save what
little ass I have left, ok?

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:35.324
You know, you keep hiding from shit in the world,
and eventually the world comes to your front door.

01:15:35.359 --> 01:15:39.593
Nice! - That's very nice! - I heard it
in an episode of Touched by an Angel.

01:15:39.628 --> 01:15:45.704
You keep this thing real quiet and you make sure you
have real evidence. And maybe I'll see what I can do...

01:15:45.739 --> 01:15:47.859
but if you make a lot of noise and
you attract the media attention...

01:15:47.894 --> 01:15:51.525
then you bring the DA in
on this, I am out, okay?

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:57.439
We're going in there like church mice. There is one
case, one case in your career you go all in. This is it.

01:15:57.474 --> 01:16:03.556
All right, then you do us proud.
Because I do not want those scrubs.

01:16:03.591 --> 01:16:05.894
Really?
- No.

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:09.957
You're not aware that's a TLC song.
- I have no idea what are you talking about.

01:16:09.992 --> 01:16:12.476
You said Chasing Waterfalls, you
saying I don't want no scrubs.

01:16:12.477 --> 01:16:14.650
- I don't even understand those reference.
- Like a tick.

01:16:14.685 --> 01:16:16.812
I have no idea what you're
talking about but remember...

01:16:16.847 --> 01:16:18.262
this thing gets messy, we never talked.

01:16:18.297 --> 01:16:21.428
You can trust us.
- Real quiet, you got to creep.

01:16:21.463 --> 01:16:27.368
Come on, you don't say Creep
Creep unless you're quoting TLC.

01:16:27.403 --> 01:16:31.832
Hey guys, you know Danson and
Highsmith were not good cops, right?

01:16:31.867 --> 01:16:35.707
Yeah I guess we kinda knew that. But it's a drag I
mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?

01:16:35.742 --> 01:16:39.101
Not to be corny. Maybe it's you guys.

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:42.667
Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:54.609
The highlights are great.
- Thank you.

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:56.394
Sexy but serious.
- Thank you.

01:16:56.429 --> 01:17:01.074
Who the hell are all these people?
I was only expecting one man.

01:17:01.109 --> 01:17:04.685
You know, just some people I owe money to.
- Then let's be here.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.487
Who are they?

01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:14.287
They are some Chechnian patriots,
entrepreneurs and the black

01:17:14.288 --> 01:17:18.454
chaps are some
businessmen from Nigeria.

01:17:18.489 --> 01:17:20.841
You owe money to the Nigerians and Chechnians...

01:17:20.876 --> 01:17:22.057
Yes, yes I do.

01:17:22.092 --> 01:17:23.466
You're a piece of work.

01:17:23.622 --> 01:17:28.151
Thank you. It'd be best to start it.

01:17:28.186 --> 01:17:31.952
This is good, baby. We're in
the game and we know the score.

01:17:31.987 --> 01:17:34.886
It kinda bugs me that we still
don't know who Ershon is targeting.

01:17:34.921 --> 01:17:37.885
Is it the lotto? Who is it?
- Who cares.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.413
Some rich prick.

01:17:39.448 --> 01:17:45.014
I had to tell you I'm tremendously
excited about this deal.

01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:50.514
I can assure you that every dime of your money
will be invested with the utmost diligence.

01:17:50.549 --> 01:17:54.499
The returns are really exciting. I think
our members is gonna be just thrilled.

01:17:54.534 --> 01:17:57.969
It made about 18 percent
over the last ten years.

01:17:58.004 --> 01:18:01.060
Quiet as a church mouse. In and out.

01:18:01.095 --> 01:18:04.068
You know I got tingling in my balls you were talking about.
- Beautiful.

01:18:04.103 --> 01:18:10.030
All right, listen up, I am detective Gamble and
this is detective Hoitz. We need your cooperation.

01:18:10.065 --> 01:18:13.951
David Ershon, you are
under arrest for fraud...

01:18:13.986 --> 01:18:18.015
embezzlement and the connection to the murder of Don Beaman.
- Bad idea.

01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:24.969
Hey guys! - Bob, what are you
doing here? - I'm investing.

01:18:25.004 --> 01:18:29.128
Remember I talked about that proxy vote
a while back? This is what it was for.

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:32.344
Holy shit! - It's more aggressive
investment strategy for the pension,

01:18:32.379 --> 01:18:35.524
Allen, we are the suckers. They are
targeting the police pension fund!

01:18:42.704 --> 01:18:48.554
Gentlemen, you are here illegally and without a
warrant. We are within our rights to take action.

01:19:43.899 --> 01:19:46.844
So much for quiet as church mice.
- Go.

01:19:51.598 --> 01:19:53.626
Who the hell are those guys?

01:19:53.661 --> 01:19:56.501
Gentlemen, I can give you non-obstructive
view tickets for "Rock of Ages".

01:19:56.536 --> 01:19:59.964
But even I admit, that's not very tempting,
I'm not made of tickets, God damn it.

01:20:07.023 --> 01:20:11.484
Shoot him.
- Jamie go get over here. You, go get the bloody car.

01:20:11.519 --> 01:20:15.945
That's it mate, I have had it
with this joker and his wooden gun.

01:20:18.952 --> 01:20:23.803
They gonna kill me and then they will kill you.
- I'm gonna kill you first.

01:20:23.838 --> 01:20:26.720
And then they will kill me.
- We got two rogue police officers.

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:30.948
They're armed and dangerous and holding David Ershon hostage.
- Guys, we are good guys.

01:20:30.983 --> 01:20:34.857
Exactly, they are the good guys.
- Where do we go? Where do we go?

01:20:34.892 --> 01:20:37.582
I have a small apartment
no one knows about it.

01:20:37.617 --> 01:20:42.673
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.
Not at the same time, that would be wrong.

01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:47.525
Let's hear it from
the top, every detail.

01:20:48.934 --> 01:20:52.274
It is the best to tell the
stories by starting from the end.

01:20:52.309 --> 01:20:55.440
Briefly and then go
back to the beginning.

01:20:55.475 --> 01:21:00.691
Then periodically returned to the end, maybe
giving different characters perspective throughout.

01:21:00.726 --> 01:21:05.910
Just a bit of dynamism, otherwise it will be a linear story.
- Just tell us what happened.

01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:08.364
I lost a bunch of money from some
people, and now they want it back.

01:21:08.399 --> 01:21:10.068
What about Don Beaman?

01:21:10.103 --> 01:21:14.025
Beaman knew that I'd falsify my
financials so they sent down Wesley to...

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:15.093
try and keep him quiet.

01:21:15.128 --> 01:21:19.756
They forced him at gunpoint to drink a
bunch of gin and forced him onto the ledge.

01:21:19.791 --> 01:21:20.924
It was just a matter
of time before he fell.

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.334
At least we stop you from
getting the pension fund.

01:21:23.369 --> 01:21:28.778
Well, you didn't, it's already in my
account and by 9 o'clock in the morning

01:21:28.813 --> 01:21:33.295
it gets into the Lendl equity fund then from there
it's transferred to a dozen of offshore accounts.

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:34.018
By 09:01 it's gone.

01:21:34.053 --> 01:21:36.820
What if we stop the transfer?
- But you can't.

01:21:36.855 --> 01:21:42.703
What if we stop the transfer?
- You have to be at the endemic bank at 9 o'clock exactly.

01:21:42.738 --> 01:21:46.130
Find the clerk, get the routing number.
- We got to stop it.

01:21:46.165 --> 01:21:49.675
There's no way! I mean every cop,
the crazy Australian and his crew?

01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:50.675
They all be after us.

01:21:50.710 --> 01:21:55.217
You could, let me go, and
I'll give you $10 million each.

01:21:55.252 --> 01:21:56.234
It's not a bribe.

01:21:56.235 --> 01:22:00.799
Of course, it's a bribe. You're
offering to pay us money to not do our job.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.714
It's not a bribe.
- We're hanging over here tonight

01:22:05.749 --> 01:22:07.511
Nobody knows about
this place. We'd be safe.

01:22:07.545 --> 01:22:08.875
And tomorrow we hit it.

01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:12.197
First thing first, I got to go see Sheila.
- No way, it's too dangerous.

01:22:12.232 --> 01:22:15.284
Look, Terry, we don't know
what's gonna happen to us tomorrow.

01:22:15.285 --> 01:22:17.894
But tonight, I need to make
things right with Sheila.

01:22:17.929 --> 01:22:21.934
All right, go! Go! Be careful.
- Thanks. I will.

01:22:21.969 --> 01:22:25.197
You say hi to Sheila for me?
- Ok.

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:28.665
Tell her, say, Terry
was asking about you

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:32.936
he wants to make sure you know that he'll be
there for you if anything happens.

01:22:32.971 --> 01:22:36.942
Yeah, drop of a hat. I'm there.
- Look, it's starting to get a little weird man.

01:22:36.977 --> 01:22:39.535
If something happens to you, I
need to be there to take care of her.

01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:42.487
All of her wants, her needs and
desires are now my responsibility.

01:22:42.488 --> 01:22:44.875
- Why do you say it like it's a
pre-determined thing?

01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:50.048
Just go, man.
- Ok. Thanks. - Go!

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:58.067
Chenko Gallery.
- Francine, it's Terry, please don't hang up.

01:23:08.196 --> 01:23:14.186
Please pick up. - Hello. - Hey Sweetie,
I was praying you be at your mom's house.

01:23:14.221 --> 01:23:18.112
You know what, I can't talk anymore,
I think the phone is being tapped.

01:23:18.147 --> 01:23:20.024
Oh, baby, where are you? I wanna see you.

01:23:20.025 --> 01:23:23.496
I am near the place where we did
it 3 Halloweens ago, do you remember?

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:26.324
Umm, ok, yeah I got it.

01:23:26.359 --> 01:23:29.573
I just want you to know, watch out,
I think they are watching the house.

01:23:29.608 --> 01:23:32.523
Don't worry sweetie, I think
I have a way of getting to you.

01:23:32.558 --> 01:23:40.994
I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean,
after all those years, after the restraining order...

01:23:41.029 --> 01:23:43.870
I was worried whether I'll see you again.

01:23:49.803 --> 01:23:50.680
Just the old lady

01:23:57.370 --> 01:24:01.085
Hello Allen,
- Hello Mama Ramos. What are doing out here?

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.178
Sheila said she doesn't know what
happened and she wants you back.

01:24:04.213 --> 01:24:08.694
She also says she
wants you on top of her.

01:24:08.729 --> 01:24:17.246
Holding her hair and riding her like a bucking
brand... while she sucks your thumb and says, Mami likey.

01:24:17.281 --> 01:24:19.362
You tell your daughter...

01:24:19.397 --> 01:24:24.226
He said, he'll always love you, and he's
so happy that you're having his child.

01:24:24.261 --> 01:24:24.715
Allen.

01:24:24.716 --> 01:24:32.060
He also says that he wants you to stare into
each other eyes without blinking while you do it.

01:24:32.095 --> 01:24:36.738
And then afterward, lick
the sweat off each other.

01:24:36.773 --> 01:24:40.153
I don't wanna do this.

01:24:40.188 --> 01:24:43.996
You say things that are too personal.
- Ok.

01:24:44.031 --> 01:24:45.400
But just one more thing.

01:24:45.435 --> 01:24:46.735
She said she loves you

01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:50.907
and wants to hold your hand
and have ice tea with you.

01:24:50.942 --> 01:24:54.139
Come on! That's not all she said.

01:24:54.174 --> 01:25:01.761
No. She says other things.
- Please, you don't realize I might be killed tomorrow.

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:13.566
Ok. She says she wants to unplug all the clocks
and the phones and have a three day sex marathon.

01:25:13.601 --> 01:25:14.439
That's more like it. Yeah.

01:25:14.474 --> 01:25:19.857
She wants to walk wrong for a week
because you guys did it so hard.

01:25:19.892 --> 01:25:26.027
That's just lovely.
- No more! He says things I can't say.

01:25:26.062 --> 01:25:32.470
It involves a mannequin hands and
electric shaver taped to a golf club.

01:25:36.276 --> 01:25:44.656
Now what she say?
- She says she loves you.

01:25:50.385 --> 01:25:56.545
I'm so sorry. About everything. I just had to
come here tonight to tell you that I love you.

01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:00.794
And the reason why I act
like you are a plain wife

01:26:00.795 --> 01:26:08.401
is that I am afraid if I admit to how stunning
and intelligent and how wonderful you are...

01:26:08.436 --> 01:26:10.769
I just loose you.

01:26:10.804 --> 01:26:15.366
Shut up, Allen! I love you.
- We have a place that's safe.

01:26:28.094 --> 01:26:29.925
I wanna break your hip.

01:26:34.914 --> 01:26:40.791
I am about to do you grandpa style.

01:26:46.063 --> 01:26:48.564
8:36 AM 24 MINUTES TO BANK TRANSFER

01:26:54.779 --> 01:26:56.279
I brought some music.

01:27:00.823 --> 01:27:06.376
Not what I would have chosen. But all right.
- Let's go, Monday morning. Time to go to work.

01:27:06.411 --> 01:27:08.709
Let's do it.
- You want my gate code?

01:27:08.744 --> 01:27:11.228
Shut up man.

01:27:15.949 --> 01:27:17.585
That's Wesley.

01:27:27.664 --> 01:27:29.524
Yes

01:27:31.119 --> 01:27:34.096
Where did you learn to drive like that?
- Grand Theft Auto.

01:27:37.292 --> 01:27:38.239
They're coming.

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:46.353
Faster, Allen.
- Hold on. Hold on.

01:28:06.162 --> 01:28:08.858
Someone has been
playing Grand Theft Auto.

01:28:08.893 --> 01:28:12.422
Boom. I did that.

01:28:12.457 --> 01:28:15.230
Oh my God, that's what I'm
talking about. We jack-knifed them.

01:28:15.231 --> 01:28:18.003
You see that? It went backwards
and then turned upside down.

01:28:18.038 --> 01:28:21.513
Gator took vans upside down,
like a crazy washing machine.

01:28:21.548 --> 01:28:23.705
Why are you calling yourself Gator?

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:26.428
It's a nickname I had in college.
I used to run a dating service.

01:28:26.463 --> 01:28:28.831
He was a pimp.
- Yes, I was a pimp.

01:28:28.866 --> 01:28:33.144
Right now, the street are a bloodbath.
Statistically speaking, there's

01:28:33.145 --> 01:28:37.482
about 30 kids in here, 10 of you
will be dead before your next birthday.

01:28:37.517 --> 01:28:40.694
Got a couple of tips, helped
the guys stay out of the jail.

01:28:40.729 --> 01:28:44.809
One, Try your hardest to
not be black or Hispanic.

01:28:44.844 --> 01:28:46.953
It's a good tip.
- Two.

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:52.368
Gentlemen, we got a hot one. Hoitz and Gamble have
Ershon hostage. High speed car chase in progress.

01:28:52.403 --> 01:28:56.933
Yes, gun, gun! Pass up the gun. Let's go people.
- Here we go.

01:28:56.968 --> 01:28:58.116
Okay, any tazers? No? Good.

01:28:58.151 --> 01:28:59.230
Who wants to go on a ride along?

01:28:59.265 --> 01:29:02.264
Huh? Huh? All right, you sweetie. Come on. Let's go.
- Move!

01:29:11.698 --> 01:29:16.616
Oh cool, a helicopter. Must be
covering the high speed chase.

01:29:26.908 --> 01:29:30.157
Who are those guys?
- That Chatson and Westes.

01:29:30.192 --> 01:29:33.403
We went an Chechen version
of Dora the Explorer.

01:29:33.438 --> 01:29:34.919
It went terribly wrong.

01:29:37.364 --> 01:29:39.993
It seems like it's unfair
that they have a helicopter.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.725
Damn it.

01:29:48.455 --> 01:29:52.207
God your hair is soft.
- I use hot oil.

01:29:55.328 --> 01:29:57.622
They are gonna wreck us twice.
Coming from both directions.

01:29:57.657 --> 01:29:58.533
We're not gonna wreck.

01:30:00.004 --> 01:30:04.653
I'm going to wreck, you're right.
- What do you mean right?

01:30:20.225 --> 01:30:22.874
This is a very clever idea.
- Yeah.

01:30:36.028 --> 01:30:39.056
Holy God.
- Let's go.

01:30:50.943 --> 01:30:54.066
They are Nigerians.
Yeah, I forgot about that.

01:31:01.029 --> 01:31:04.240
This is a shortcut.
- Are you kidding me? You cannot go down there.

01:31:11.595 --> 01:31:12.603
What are you doing?

01:31:19.114 --> 01:31:19.724
Hit him.

01:31:26.885 --> 01:31:28.895
Where are we?
- Chelsea Pier.

01:31:34.748 --> 01:31:36.321
What the hell?

01:31:44.863 --> 01:31:47.310
They are having a helicopter,
is definitely cheating.

01:31:47.345 --> 01:31:48.915
Go.

01:31:56.329 --> 01:31:58.788
We are cops, hit the chopper.

01:32:20.385 --> 01:32:23.213
It's Martin and Fossi.
Back off and stop calling.

01:32:24.658 --> 01:32:27.328
Setting the perimeter, no
arrest until we get there.

01:32:27.363 --> 01:32:29.083
Hit the light.

01:32:48.323 --> 01:32:50.310
Do not authorize that
transfer. This is David Ershon.

01:32:50.311 --> 01:32:53.108
The transfer is for him. He will tell
you not to authorize it, ok? Tell him!

01:32:53.474 --> 01:32:56.290
Tell him!
- Do as they say, stop the transfer.

01:32:56.325 --> 01:32:59.304
Approve it. Now.

01:32:59.339 --> 01:33:01.415
Do not touch anything!

01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:03.699
Swear to God, I'd blow
your head all over this desk.

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:06.338
Not a person in this room
believes you'll shoot this clerk.

01:33:06.373 --> 01:33:11.606
Oh yeah? Thank you so much, gentlemen,
for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.

01:33:11.641 --> 01:33:14.500
I have two competing bids
from jilted investors.

01:33:14.535 --> 01:33:18.549
They're at 30 million. And holding.

01:33:18.584 --> 01:33:21.370
No, wait.
- Take him away.

01:33:21.405 --> 01:33:24.574
But computers.

01:33:24.609 --> 01:33:27.742
What if one day they were in charge?

01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:33.820
If you don't shut up, I will cut
your rear off with a butter knife.

01:33:33.855 --> 01:33:36.091
That's blunt. Blunt's worse.

01:33:42.936 --> 01:33:47.413
You just stood there.
- I didn't know. How was I supposed to know that?

01:33:47.448 --> 01:33:49.430
I knew it, man.

01:33:49.465 --> 01:33:51.853
You kill us, we kill Ershon
and you lost $30 million.

01:33:51.888 --> 01:33:53.781
Who's got the golden goose now, huh?

01:33:56.166 --> 01:34:02.627
He is still valuable
with a bullet wound, mate.

01:34:02.662 --> 01:34:06.152
You immediately called your bluff.
- Get up, and kill the police.

01:34:06.187 --> 01:34:09.337
I just want to make sure I get it
right. Did you want this transfer approved?

01:34:09.372 --> 01:34:13.632
Or not approved?
- Here, mate, I wanna kill just for fun.

01:34:15.517 --> 01:34:17.554
Police, don't move! Drop your weapons.

01:34:17.589 --> 01:34:20.835
Drop it. Or be dropped, tall boy.

01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:24.081
Hope you like prison food. And penis.

01:34:24.116 --> 01:34:26.536
Police stand on the ground.

01:34:34.984 --> 01:34:39.567
Hey, hey, you ok?
- Hey Gene... Captain, I'm sorry.

01:34:39.602 --> 01:34:43.193
That's ok. Don't worry about it. You can
call me Gene when we're not in office.

01:34:43.228 --> 01:34:46.635
Thanks for coming by.
- Atta boy.

01:34:46.670 --> 01:34:52.705
Oo, hey, come on, stay with me.
We're losing him. He's dying.

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:58.765
No, I'm just resting.
- Did I hurt you?

01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.837
Just resting.

01:34:59.872 --> 01:35:04.551
Hey, let me tell you something: As far as
the paperwork goes, we'll take care of it.

01:35:04.586 --> 01:35:07.384
You know why? - Why?
- I'm not too proud to beg.

01:35:07.419 --> 01:35:10.015
Come on.
- What?

01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:12.785
That's not funny anymore.
- I do not know what you're talking about.

01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:15.737
TLC references.
- Still nothing, I swear to you.

01:35:15.772 --> 01:35:19.766
I'm gonna go over and check on
Terry. I have a bad knee, hold on.

01:35:19.801 --> 01:35:23.160
It was the king of the mud cases.

01:35:23.195 --> 01:35:27.064
But Allen and Terry have
worked it like stars.

01:35:27.099 --> 01:35:34.703
Within 24 hours learning about Ershon's
scheme and Lendl's massive losses...

01:35:34.738 --> 01:35:38.055
the government issued
TARP fund to bail out Lendl.

01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:43.195
Lendl is in everything and we're gonna go everywhere...
- They were too big to fail.

01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:49.011
Ershon now resides in Palamino
federal correctional facility in Florida.

01:35:49.046 --> 01:35:51.625
Still invests, currency
is just different.

01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:57.226
Roger Wesley was linked to the Beaman
murder by a security cam footage...

01:35:57.261 --> 01:35:58.973
which Martin and Fossi hadn't checked.

01:35:59.008 --> 01:36:00.649
It only showed the back of their heads

01:36:00.684 --> 01:36:04.648
but Allen's face back app was
able to get a match to their faces.

01:36:04.683 --> 01:36:09.744
Terry married Francine, he played harp
at the reception and it was beautiful.

01:36:09.779 --> 01:36:13.887
He learned how to play it in 8th grade to
make fun the fairy that lived up the street.

01:36:13.922 --> 01:36:18.374
Terry asked Sheila to be his
best man, but she declined.

01:36:18.409 --> 01:36:24.313
Let's be honest, we all want to be
superstars and hotshots, but guess what...

01:36:24.348 --> 01:36:27.827
the people that do the real work,
the ones that make the difference...

01:36:27.862 --> 01:36:30.636
you don't see 'em on
TV or on the front page.

01:36:30.671 --> 01:36:32.905
I am talking about
the day in day outers,

01:36:32.906 --> 01:36:36.201
the grinders, come on man, you
know what I'm talking about...

01:36:36.236 --> 01:36:37.510
The other guys...

01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:42.373
Goldman Sachs, this
case is gonna be nasty

01:36:42.408 --> 01:36:46.710
Hi, cute glasses.

01:36:46.745 --> 01:36:49.311
What was that?
- What?

01:36:49.346 --> 01:36:52.923
Dude, what is it with you and
hot ladies? What's your secret?

01:36:52.958 --> 01:36:55.536
Honestly, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:36:55.571 --> 01:36:59.651
Tell me who you lost your virginity to?
- She actually became a TV actress.

01:36:59.686 --> 01:37:02.113
Heather Locklear.
- What, Heather Locklear?

01:37:02.148 --> 01:37:03.454
You've heard of her?
- Come on.

01:37:03.489 --> 01:37:06.733
She was much chubbier back then.
- I don't get it.
