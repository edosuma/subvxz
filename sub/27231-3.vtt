00:00.000 --> 00:01.735
Previously on "All Stars"...

00:01.735 --> 00:03.303
I'm holding auditions

00:03.303 --> 00:06.540
for my new super group
called Henny,

00:06.540 --> 00:08.175
featuring Stacy Layne Matthews.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.476
[cheers and applause]

00:09.476 --> 00:10.510
Yeow!

00:10.510 --> 00:12.479
Me and Farrah
had a big falling out.

00:12.479 --> 00:13.714
No.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.149
According to your team,
you're the weakest link.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.185
Gia, I don't have time
for your drama.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.386
You've been trying
to gas her up.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.188
Just in case
it's her last time here--

00:21.188 --> 00:22.489
Oh, my God.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.725

00:33.166 --> 00:34.701
The movements
have to be precise.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.937
The whitest dancer
I've ever seen in my life.

00:36.937 --> 00:37.971
Oh.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.173
Valentina,
you're a winner, baby.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.341
[applause]

00:41.341 --> 00:44.912
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

00:44.912 --> 00:47.547
I made this decision
with a broken heart.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.484
But I chose Farrah Moan.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.221
Farrah Moan, sashay away.

01:05.265 --> 01:07.034
- Mm.
- Farrah Moan.

01:07.034 --> 01:10.737
- Oh.
- Oh, you don't love me.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.073
"Shine bright, All Stars.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.442
Hugs and kisses. Farrah."

01:15.442 --> 01:16.710
Where's the hugs
and kisses at?

01:16.710 --> 01:17.711
Am I missing something?

01:17.711 --> 01:18.712
XOXO.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.081
Oh. Yeah. You're right.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.317
[all laugh]

01:23.317 --> 01:25.485
You guys, this is really
fucking hard.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.220
It's not a cute feeling.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.622
Why did she get the chop?

01:28.622 --> 01:32.059
Being that she was
in the bottom last week,

01:32.059 --> 01:36.096
this week she had a moment
to redeem herself,

01:36.096 --> 01:37.331
but she was still in the bottom.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.865
This is "All Stars."

01:38.865 --> 01:41.935
This is not like give
a third chance to a girl.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.639
Valentina just sent home
her friend.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.307
Shit is getting real.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.743
Bitches are going to be
going home every week,

01:49.743 --> 01:52.245
and they should.

01:52.245 --> 01:53.647
Get the hell out of here.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.315
I'm just trying
to be fair here.

01:55.315 --> 01:57.584
And so then my fucking win
bitched because--

01:57.584 --> 01:58.618
You twirled.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.287
And she knew her lyrics.

02:00.287 --> 02:05.025
There's certain things that I
came here to prove and deliver,

02:05.025 --> 02:08.328
and one of them was to slay
a motherfucking lip sync.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.097
You were a sex kitten.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.231
The house.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.499
You were fucking dancing,
twirling, spinning.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.968
- All of it.
- Everything on you.

02:14.968 --> 02:19.506
[sound effect, crowd applause]

02:21.008 --> 02:22.509
I mean, I know I'm Mexican,

02:22.509 --> 02:24.244
but I don't even know
how to clean.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.513
[all laugh]

02:26.513 --> 02:29.282
I do think that Valentina
is a pretty formidable opponent,

02:29.282 --> 02:30.917
but bitch, I'm mad.

02:30.917 --> 02:33.653
I know that I fucking
turned this lip sync out,

02:33.653 --> 02:35.455
and I wanted 10.000
fucking dollars.

02:35.455 --> 02:36.923
I'm mad.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.793
Monet, out of curiosity,

02:39.793 --> 02:42.529
what lipstick did you choose?

02:43.930 --> 02:45.866
I chose Jasmine Masters.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.134
[all laugh]

02:47.134 --> 02:48.502
You is stupid.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.638
No, I chose Farrah, too,
because she tried.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.841
Unfortunately,
her best was not good enough

02:54.841 --> 02:57.077
to validate her being here.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.780
Gia, do you feel like
you had closure with Farrah?

02:59.780 --> 03:01.581
Well, yeah.
She was walking off

03:01.581 --> 03:03.417
and I went to give her a hug,
and I said "I love you."

03:03.417 --> 03:06.153
And she said, "No, actually,
you don't love me."

03:06.153 --> 03:08.155
You actually don't love me.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.424
I guess I can just
go to sleep tonight

03:10.424 --> 03:12.926
knowing that at least I tried.

03:12.926 --> 03:16.063
And for Monique and Monet,
you know, who

03:16.063 --> 03:18.832
haven't really had
a lot of time to get to know me,

03:18.832 --> 03:21.835
whatever y'all thought
that I was trying to do

03:21.835 --> 03:23.670
is not really who I am.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.073
I don't enjoy Gia Gunn at all.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.208
People love her, because
she's a shit stirrer

03:28.208 --> 03:29.543
and she stirs the pot.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.813
But she's been annoying as fuck
for the past two weeks.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.415
World, I cannot.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.550
Let's go, bitch.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.885
I'm like, I'm gonna
take this hair off.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.087
This is a serious question.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.254
I'm not trying to be shady.

03:41.254 --> 03:42.656
Did you really think

03:42.656 --> 03:44.224
that you were going to
walk out there in that costume

03:44.224 --> 03:46.860
with that hair
and sell an Ariana Grande song?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.595
Girl, I just wanted
to give Ariana, you know--

03:48.595 --> 03:49.663
She didn't even know
the words.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.631
- I did know the words.
- Girl, please.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.867
Monet's costumes are cheap.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.869
A little body suit
from the dance store.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.870
That ain't cutting it.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.472
This is "All Stars."

03:58.472 --> 04:00.373
Where's the All Star?

04:00.373 --> 04:04.044
You did emotions in that gown,
which was very questionable.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.346
How is that questionable?

04:06.346 --> 04:07.848
Trinity is coming for her,
girl.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.182
Why is the bitch mad?

04:09.182 --> 04:10.650
Maybe because she knows

04:10.650 --> 04:12.352
she did a mediocre job
in the challenge.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.255
Girl, don't do it.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.857
Emotions in a gown?

04:16.857 --> 04:17.958
Everybody was in--

04:17.958 --> 04:20.861
No, no, not into the gown.
That gown.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.062
That gown.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.264
This week, I was safe.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.499
Girl, don't even--

04:25.499 --> 04:27.267
Okay, look at your closet,
and go look at mine.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.436
- There is no comparison.
- Let me go see.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.204
No comparison.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.405
That's tired. Fresh.

04:32.405 --> 04:35.609
But The Tuck
doesn't stay down for long.

04:35.609 --> 04:39.513
Before you question my taste,
get you a taste.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.715
She will rise and rise again.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.253

The first step to finding love

05:45.946 --> 05:47.847
And if you can fake that,

05:47.847 --> 05:50.217
then you can make

Fire, honey.

06:06.566 --> 06:07.634
Hey, All Stars.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.668
- Hi-ee.
- Hey.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.037
Now, it's time to step up

06:11.037 --> 06:13.440
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent,

06:13.440 --> 06:15.375

I got you.

06:33.193 --> 06:37.030
This time, you need to win
our hearts, too.

06:37.030 --> 06:40.033
Now for the first time
in "Drag Race" herstory,

you'll be playing
the Snatch Game of Love.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.773
- Oh.
- Oh.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.542
Now, you'll need
to stay in character

06:49.542 --> 06:53.546
as you bewitch, bother,
and bewilder

06:53.546 --> 06:58.585
a hot celebrity "snatchelor"
on TV's hottest new dating show.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.197
- Yeah.
- Snatch Game.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.799
♪ Snatch it ♪

07:15.335 --> 07:17.704
With Snatch Game being
the Snatch Game of Love,

07:17.704 --> 07:20.707
now we need to take into account
our character's love life,

07:20.707 --> 07:24.878
and how that would portray
in this new twist on the game.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.414
The last time when
I was here for Season 8,

07:27.414 --> 07:28.615
I was so scared.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.652
When I think of pride,
I think of...my hair.

07:34.321 --> 07:37.557
This time I'm going in it
with doing Wendy Williams.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.893
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

07:39.893 --> 07:42.095
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.129
Yes.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.631
It's a huge opportunity

07:44.631 --> 07:46.633
to prove myself
to the other queens,

07:46.633 --> 07:48.368
because on Season 8,

07:48.368 --> 07:50.036
a lot of the queens
would typecast me

07:50.036 --> 07:52.038
as like just wanting
to be a model.

07:52.038 --> 07:55.842
And as much as I do love to
model and love to look good,

07:55.842 --> 07:58.511
don't underestimate
Naomi Smalls.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.615
How would you do Whitney?

08:02.615 --> 08:03.650
Do you have her voice down?

08:03.650 --> 08:06.686
Um, not necessarily
her voice down,

08:06.686 --> 08:09.122
like the house on boots
ti-ca-ca.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.558
I did so well on my season
of Snatch Game.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.893
Maya Angelou
ain't no punk bitch.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.228
[all laugh]

08:15.228 --> 08:17.897
So anything less than that
in "All Stars" 4

08:17.897 --> 08:19.432
is going to fuck me up.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.734
So I'm hoping
to take Whitney Houston

08:20.734 --> 08:22.836
and push it over the edge.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.970
I also have like a spray bottle.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.071
And I think it would be so funny

08:25.071 --> 08:26.139
is every time
they come to her,

08:26.139 --> 08:27.574
she's wetter
and sweatier every time.

08:27.574 --> 08:30.243
By the end, it's gonna be
just a drenched, wet wig.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.116
We gonna pray.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.386
Della Reese.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.221
- It's my Della.
- Yeah?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.889
- My Della.
- Oh, "Touched By An Angel."

08:42.889 --> 08:45.125
- She's giving it, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.827
Snatch Game on my season,
Season 4,

08:47.827 --> 08:50.463
horrible.

08:50.463 --> 08:53.366
Let's move on
to Miss Aretha Franklin.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.769
- [farts]
- Disgraceful.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.773
Snatch Game was
the most Romper Room fuckery

08:59.773 --> 09:01.641
that I have ever experienced
in my life.

09:01.641 --> 09:04.477
Ain't no way in hell
I'm doing that again.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.513
This new version
of the Snatch Game

09:06.513 --> 09:07.847
is the opportunity I need

09:07.847 --> 09:11.184
to give them a performance
that I'm capable of.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.087
The game has changed so much
since we were on "Drag Race."

09:14.087 --> 09:15.355
It's like Season 3,

09:15.355 --> 09:18.591
it was like so easy for me
to come out and impress.

09:18.591 --> 09:22.195
Now drag has been elevated
so much.

09:22.195 --> 09:26.399
I feel like I'm just like
an old dinosaur of drag.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.700
We the OGs, girl.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.135
Girl, it's throwing me
for a loop.

09:29.135 --> 09:32.338
I've been out of the drag race
game for many years,

09:32.338 --> 09:36.943
so my performance last week
was a huge wake-up call.

09:36.943 --> 09:40.680
That performance was not
an "All Star" performance.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.449
What the fuck
are you doing, Manila?

09:42.449 --> 09:44.918
Come on, girl.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.386
Pblblblblbl.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.556
I feel like
I've been safe and coasting,

09:49.556 --> 09:52.158
and that is not
what I am here to do.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.928
Amen, because this might be
our last chance ever--

09:54.928 --> 09:56.529
- Ever.
- To come back.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.664
Yeah.

09:57.664 --> 10:00.400
It's time to step it up.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.935
I want to win a challenge

10:01.935 --> 10:04.471
and $10.000.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.406
If you did like girls,
would you date me?

10:06.406 --> 10:07.774
Mm-hmm.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.577
[laughs] You're so sweet.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.811
What are you going to do
for your character?

10:11.811 --> 10:13.046
I'm going to do Eartha Kitt.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.414
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

10:14.414 --> 10:17.183
I was thinking you were
going to do somebody Latina,

10:17.183 --> 10:19.452
like, I thought you were
honestly going to do Selena.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.088
- No, that's not funny.
- Yeah.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.089
Who are you doing?

10:23.089 --> 10:24.224
I'm going to do
Caitlyn Jenner.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.692
- Caitlyn Jenner.
- Mm-hmm.

10:25.692 --> 10:29.295
Isn't that what Trinity's
going to do?

10:29.295 --> 10:31.364
- Is she?
- I think so.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.799
Oh, I didn't know.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.800
You should find out, girl.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.068
Trinity.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.803
You're going to do Caitlyn?

10:36.803 --> 10:37.904
Yeah.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.406
Who are you doing?

10:40.406 --> 10:42.242
Well, I'm going to do
Caitlyn, too.

10:43.743 --> 10:46.045
Girl, I already got
my outfit, like--

10:46.045 --> 10:47.780
Well, I already have my outfit
and my hair out,

10:47.780 --> 10:49.649
so, honey, this is
the winner right here.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.784
What are your other options?

10:51.784 --> 10:52.952
You have to have a backup,
right?

10:52.952 --> 10:54.287
I mean, of course
I have backups,

10:54.287 --> 10:56.890
but I'd rather do
what I want to do.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.091
Well, what you want to do

10:58.091 --> 11:00.260
is not necessarily
what you're going to do.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.528
Vice versa.

11:02.695 --> 11:03.863
Goop.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.970
And then y'all should go
to commercial right there.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.545
I figured if anyone else
was going to do Caitlyn,

11:18.545 --> 11:20.280
y'all were just going
to let me do it because--

11:20.280 --> 11:22.749
- Let you?
- She's trans and I'm trans.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.117
That ain't
got nothin' to do it.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.853
Girl, that ain't an excuse
to let you do Caitlyn.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.657
Today's maxi challenge
is the Snatch Game of Love.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.392
I'm doing Miss Caitlyn,

11:32.392 --> 11:34.561
and Gia's planning on doing
Miss Caitlyn.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.730
No, ma'am. No, ma'am.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.165
How are you going
to go about it?

11:39.165 --> 11:41.401
'Cause I was going to go about
it in a very comedic route.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.069
I'm going
very comedic route, too.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.871
Oh, you got that, all right.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.608
- Oops.
- I'm gonna tell ya my story.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.009
I was gonna do--

11:50.009 --> 11:53.413
I just don't know how you girls
walk in these things.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.148
- No, okay, come on.
What else you got?

11:55.148 --> 11:57.750
- So who is your backup?

11:57.750 --> 12:02.855
- Well, um, I don't really have
a backup.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.457
- You came to "All Stars" 4

12:04.457 --> 12:06.659
without a backup
for Snatch Game?

12:06.659 --> 12:08.027
- Um...

12:09.362 --> 12:12.231
- Well, I guess I could do Jenny
from Nails on Seventh,

12:12.231 --> 12:15.134
Cardi B's nail artist.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.302
Oh.
That's more like it.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.104
- Because me do nail.
You like acrylic or gel?

12:18.104 --> 12:19.606
- Ah-ha!
- I'm in. I'm in.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.707
I think you should
do that, girl.

12:20.707 --> 12:21.908
You do?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.077
I mean, you already have
the nails, honey.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.847
Jenny, Cardi B's nail tech,
is an Instagram celebrity,

12:27.847 --> 12:30.049
and to be completely honest,

12:30.049 --> 12:31.584
I really don't know
much about her.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.986
But what I do know

12:32.986 --> 12:36.689
is how to impersonate somebody
that's fresh off the boat

12:36.689 --> 12:39.058
and can do good nail for you.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.627
Girl, just do it.
I mean...

12:40.627 --> 12:41.728
Okay.

12:41.728 --> 12:42.829
You'll probably
fit the role better.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.031
Whoa, what's that
supposed to mean?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.199
Well...

12:46.199 --> 12:48.067
Well, I mean,
you're Caucasian.

12:48.067 --> 12:50.203
You've got a fucked-up nose
like her.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.639
- Oh.
- Yeah, I'm out.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.407
Me being transgender

12:54.407 --> 12:56.509
and playing somebody else
who is trans

12:56.509 --> 12:58.578
I feel is very appropriate.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.381
But her being an old white bitch
with a lot of plastic surgery

13:01.381 --> 13:04.417
is maybe even more appropriate.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.486
Miss Trinity,
you better play.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.556
From the whoopie capital
of the world,

13:10.556 --> 13:12.592
it's the Snatch Game of Love,

13:12.592 --> 13:14.727
brought to you
by the Points Guy,

13:14.727 --> 13:18.197
your online travel resource
for rewards, miles, and more.

13:18.197 --> 13:22.268
And here's the Snatchmaker
himself, RuPaul.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.638
Welcome to
the Snatch Game of Love.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.876
Let's meet our first batch
of celebrity snatchlorettes.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.310
Yes, ha-ha.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.513
It's the Queen of the Night,
Whitney Houston.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.481
Hello, RuPaul. Ha-ha.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.484
Now, Whitney, how will you
know if he really loves you?

13:38.484 --> 13:39.719
Do you really know, Ru?

13:39.719 --> 13:41.587
- I don't. I don't.
- Do you know?

13:41.587 --> 13:43.523
Do you know if I know if you
know if you know if I know?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.458
- No, I don't.
- I didn't think so. Thank you.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.759
Oh, Whitney, all right.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.194
- Move on.
- All right.

13:48.194 --> 13:51.831
Next, the queen of daytime talk,
Wendy Williams.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.599
How you doing, Ru?

13:53.599 --> 13:55.034
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.869
I'm up in the wigotry of it all.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.037
How's the talk show going?

13:58.037 --> 13:59.472
We are Emmy-nominated.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.841
In my mind, we're both winners.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.210
[all laugh]
In my mind. Oh, yes.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.680
Up next, we've got
Olympic gold medalist

14:07.680 --> 14:10.650
and trans-trailblazer
Caitlyn Jenner.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.784
Ha.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.286
Hi, Caitlyn.
Are you looking for love?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.054
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.556
I'm looking for my glasses.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.358
I'm looking for a comfortable
pair of shoes right now, Ru.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.260
[all laugh]

14:21.260 --> 14:24.797
All right, up next,
the sexy, sultry songstress

14:24.797 --> 14:26.099
Eartha Kitt is here.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.533
Brrrrr.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.570
I would assume you get lots
of fabulous gifts for Christmas.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.939
- Is that true?
- Yes.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.475
- Champagne in Monte Carlo.
- Uh-huh.

14:35.475 --> 14:39.145
But you know what I really
want is pull my lever.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.513
Pull your lever?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.014
Pull the lever, crank.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.317
What does that mean,
pull my lever?

14:44.317 --> 14:48.087
Brrrrr. Pull my lever.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.958
[crickets chirping]
Crickets.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.494
- Ha-ha.
- So you all ready to play?

14:54.494 --> 14:55.795
- Yes, baby.
- Let's do this.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.663
Well, let's close
that sugar wall.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.499
[applause]

14:59.499 --> 15:02.568
Oh, they got budget here,
I see. Ha!

15:02.568 --> 15:06.472
Now, our first snatchelor
is from Telluride, Colorado.

15:06.472 --> 15:10.743
Meet Olympic skier
Gus Kenworthy.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.780
[cheers and applause]

15:13.780 --> 15:16.282
- Oh, Gus, you look good.
- Thank you.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.784
I love what you've done
with the place.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.887
Now, are you still working
out, like, an Olympian?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.889
Honestly, I'm just looking
for love at this point.

15:22.889 --> 15:23.990
- Yeah.
- I tried the apps.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.925
I tried the sites.
Been on Plenty of Fish,

15:25.925 --> 15:28.161
and I'm looking for something
a little fishier.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.896
Well, you've come
to the right place.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.397
Absolutely.

15:31.397 --> 15:33.432
Here's how the game works.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.736
You ask the snatchlorettes
some probing questions,

15:36.736 --> 15:39.839
and they'll try to win
your heart with their answers.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.641
And when the timer goes off,

15:41.641 --> 15:43.609
you choose your dream snatch.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.778
Are you ready to take it away?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.580
- I am.
- Okay.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.449
Snatchlorette number 1,
finish this sentence.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.953
On a first date, I love it
when a guy blanks.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.190
On a first date, I love it
when a guy gives me good love.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.825
My number one debut album
in 1998.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.159
Did you buy it, Gus?

16:00.159 --> 16:01.594
Uh, no, I didn't.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.263
He probably
wasn't even born, honey.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.531
[laughs]

16:05.531 --> 16:07.867
Okay, snatchlorette number 2,
same question.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.837
On the first date,
oh, it has been a while.

16:10.837 --> 16:15.041
I like to touch
their big microphone.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.510
And since I'm normally
the host,

16:17.510 --> 16:19.045
I have a question for you.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.413
Oh, dear.
What is your question?

16:20.413 --> 16:21.814
How's LL Cool J?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.517
[laughs]

16:24.517 --> 16:25.751
I read. I read things.

16:25.751 --> 16:29.121
Miss Naomi
is serving me Wendy.

16:29.121 --> 16:30.790
I'm impressed.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.959
Snatchlorette number 4,
same question.

16:32.959 --> 16:36.329
Well, you see, I love it
when a guy invites me to dance,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.931
because I studied
with Katherine Dunham,

16:38.931 --> 16:40.333
and we did many shows.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.635
And I would say monotonous.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.338
[scat singing]

16:45.338 --> 16:47.206
- Monotonous.
- Oh, wow.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.841
And Dunham
was a very strict lady.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.377
I found her to be quite
jealous, to be honest.

16:51.377 --> 16:54.113
I find you quite annoying
over here, baby.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.549
- [laughs]
- I don't know about you, Gus,

16:56.549 --> 16:59.986
but that's not a first date
I want to go on, honey.

16:59.986 --> 17:03.589
Snatchlorette number 1,
imagine you're a car.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.157
Sell yourself to me.

17:05.157 --> 17:08.895
Boy, what kind of car
did we have last week?

17:08.895 --> 17:11.297
Bobby?

17:11.297 --> 17:13.733
Miss Thing keeps talking
to the walls, girl.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.468
The walls
aren't going to talk back.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.936
- Boy?
- If they did,

17:16.936 --> 17:18.905
they'd tell you
this is not funny.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.506
I never liked
you and Bobby together.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.976
Ha.
Damn, dropped my cigarette.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.112
My Lord, if I was a car, RuPaul,

17:26.112 --> 17:30.149
I would be all the man
that I need.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.851
Thank you, RuPaul.
Thank you.

17:31.851 --> 17:36.289
Snatchlorette number 3,
imagine that you're a car.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.490
Sell yourself to me.

17:37.490 --> 17:41.994
Well, this car has had
a lot of miles, honey.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.329
[all laugh]

17:43.329 --> 17:45.131
But you know what?

17:45.131 --> 17:46.699
The engine's still running,

17:46.699 --> 17:48.801
so I'm ready
to get it on the road.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.236
You ready, Gus?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.672
[applause]
I am ready.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.740
Snatchlorette number 4.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.177
You can't sell something
you've already bought.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.578
Oh.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.380
Brrrrr.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.616
I think that's existentialism.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.685
Learn from an expert, ladies,
a real star.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.019
Just like you, Ru,

18:07.019 --> 18:09.755
I have my Hollywood star
on the Walk of Fame, thank you.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.891
Bet you paid for it
yourself, sweetie.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.459
I bet you did.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.161
I'm in the middle
of a hot topic right here.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.162
- [laughs]
- Celebrities on celebrities.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.930
Oh, my God.
Oh, my word.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.998
Ha!

18:18.998 --> 18:20.232
Gus, do you have
another question?

18:20.232 --> 18:22.468
Snatchlorette number 3,
based on your scent,

18:22.468 --> 18:24.704
what would your perfume
be called?

18:24.704 --> 18:27.873
It'd be called Malibu, baby.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.475
Everybody likes to smell

18:29.475 --> 18:33.980
like an old person
in the sun of California.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.782
- [laughs]
- Ha! Ha!

18:39.151 --> 18:41.754
Caitlyn Jenner
is really stealing the show,

18:41.754 --> 18:43.889
and I'm so entertained.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.258
Where's the strangest place
you've ever been naked?

18:46.258 --> 18:47.960
My bathroom is the only place

18:47.960 --> 18:50.763
that I'll ever take my wig off
in front of anybody.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.864
Just my reflection.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.599
I feel sorry for that mirror.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.468
[laughs]

18:55.468 --> 18:58.137
Well, Gus, baby,
I gotta be honest with ya.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.740
Looking like this,
I like long sleeves.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.842
[all laugh]

19:02.842 --> 19:03.943
Take the edge off.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.044
I'm still trying
to take the edge

19:05.044 --> 19:06.512
off that "Vanity Fair" cover.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.180
- Ooh!
- Ha!

19:08.180 --> 19:12.051
I would say my mother,
because I hate her.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.754
[all laugh]

19:14.754 --> 19:16.122
No, these are very good things
to know about someone

19:16.122 --> 19:17.123
before you date them.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.157
It is.
[buzzer]

19:18.157 --> 19:19.925
Oh, time's up, Gus.

19:19.925 --> 19:25.331
Who do you choose
from our snatchlorettes?

19:25.331 --> 19:28.067
Snatchlorette number 1,
number 2,

19:28.067 --> 19:31.237
number 3 or number 4?

19:31.237 --> 19:33.639
I'm going to go with the one
that made me laugh the most,

19:33.639 --> 19:36.709
and that is...

19:36.709 --> 19:38.044
snatchlorette number 3.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.112

You got a winner, baby.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.848
I'm taking you

19:42.848 --> 19:47.053
You best believe
I always get my man.

19:47.053 --> 19:50.990
Let's meet the snatchlorettes
you didn't choose.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.726

19:59.432 --> 20:01.233
Oh.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.138

20:08.074 --> 20:10.776
Can we get a medic over here?

20:10.776 --> 20:11.944
[all laugh]

20:11.944 --> 20:13.045
Are you okay?

20:13.045 --> 20:15.548
- I'm okay.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.483
Thank you, Wendy Williams.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.821
- Darling, hello.
- Eartha Kitt.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.522
Yes.

20:23.522 --> 20:24.857
You would have been my type.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.792
All I needed you
was to be overweight.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.127
I have a type.
So I'm just--

20:28.127 --> 20:30.362

20:41.607 --> 20:43.409

- I'm doing well.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.710
Put 'er there, buddy.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.146
Nice to meet you.
Don't touch me.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.514
[all laugh]

20:48.514 --> 20:50.850
You look like a Democrat
and broke.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.285
Happy birthday to me.

20:53.285 --> 20:55.888
I don't watch sports,
but maybe I should.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.357
I am in love, honey.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.059
Come on, hold my hand,

What's a nice guy like you

22:39.458 --> 22:41.093
doing in a place like this?

22:41.093 --> 22:43.429
Sometimes nice guys
aren't all that nice.

22:43.429 --> 22:44.563
Oh, really?

22:44.563 --> 22:47.800

All right.
Snatchlorette number 1,

22:54.173 --> 22:57.409
the first thing I notice
in someone is their eyes.

22:57.409 --> 22:58.677
What's the first thing
you notice?

22:58.677 --> 23:00.412
His shoes.

23:00.412 --> 23:02.514
'Cause you can tell a lot
by a man's shoes.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.617
Like if he got money,
they gonna be fresh.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.552
If he don't, they not.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.586
Fair enough.

23:07.586 --> 23:10.389
Snatchlorette number 2,
same question.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.658
A man's talent.

23:12.658 --> 23:15.561
I like a talent
that's really big.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.030
Oh, you like a big one, too.

23:20.432 --> 23:23.402
I like a big, big dick.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.371
You know, like a big one.

23:25.371 --> 23:29.208
Yeah, don't like
a very, very small one.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.810
I think we've got
a romantic on our hands.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.445
It's so romantic.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.314
- Like a big one.
- Yes, a big one.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.182
Just like you, a big fool.

23:37.182 --> 23:39.218
[all laugh]

23:39.218 --> 23:42.388
Snatchlorette number 2,
if we visit my parents,

23:42.388 --> 23:44.523
we'd have to sleep
in my childhood bedroom.

23:44.523 --> 23:46.091
It only has one bunk bed.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.061
Would you want to be on the top
or on the bottom?

23:49.061 --> 23:51.964
I can do it on top
and I can do it on bottom.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.500
Or actually, fuck it.
I'll just pay for a hotel.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.968
[laughs]

23:55.968 --> 24:00.539
You know, I think you talking
like a gay sex, right?

24:01.573 --> 24:04.276
Are you toppy
or you bottom, yes.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.880
And I'm like
what, what talking about?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.482
Yes, what are you
talking about?

24:10.482 --> 24:12.551
[all laugh]
It's like a gay thing, right?

24:12.551 --> 24:16.055
Is this bitch for real,
for real, for real right now?

24:16.055 --> 24:18.891
- Like a gay sex or something?
- It's okay, it's okay.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.226
Snatchlorette number 4,
same question.

24:21.226 --> 24:23.896
Is this bunk bed
reinforced by lug nuts?

24:23.896 --> 24:25.531
[laughs]

24:25.531 --> 24:26.799
I'm a power top, baby.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.033
- Ooh.
- Okay.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.435
I like middle.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.804
I like to be in the middle bed.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.106
I don't really like fuck.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.607
I like just to--

24:35.607 --> 24:37.109
Next question.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.444
[laughs]

24:38.444 --> 24:40.813
Well, I can tell you right now

24:40.813 --> 24:43.215
that she's going to be
on the bottom...

24:43.215 --> 24:46.085
Bunk.
[all laugh]

24:46.085 --> 24:49.922
Snatchlorette number 1,
when I played Kid Flash,

24:49.922 --> 24:52.124
my character's super power
was speed.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.592
What is your super power?

24:53.592 --> 24:55.961
Like I can feel like
if a man's cheating on me,

24:55.961 --> 24:56.962
you know what I mean?

24:56.962 --> 24:58.864
Shut up.

24:58.864 --> 25:01.266
And I mean, out the window,
like looking in,

25:01.266 --> 25:03.369
like is that bitch in there
with another woman?

25:03.369 --> 25:05.404
And then all of a sudden,
I just get my hammer

25:05.404 --> 25:07.706
and I just be
banging the fuck down.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.476
That's my super power.
Excuse me.

25:10.476 --> 25:11.810
Snatchlorette number 4,

25:11.810 --> 25:14.313
where was your first kiss,
and who was it with?

25:14.313 --> 25:16.014
It wasn't my proudest moment.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.250
I was a young, young gal.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.785
Oh, so you're kissing
young, too.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.186
You trashy, too.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.889
Oh!

25:23.889 --> 25:25.124
Baby.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.192
Did you say
I'm a little slutty?

25:27.192 --> 25:28.460
This is not your moment.
This is not your moment.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.996
I'm cringing for Latrice.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.298
She can't even
stay in her character

25:33.298 --> 25:35.234
because she's so irritated.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.468
- Fine.
- Shh, shh, shh.

25:36.468 --> 25:39.104
She's just rolling
her eyes so hard,

25:39.104 --> 25:40.572
it looks like she's eating ass.

25:40.572 --> 25:41.874
Snatchlorette number 3,

25:41.874 --> 25:45.077
why should I not go out
with snatchlorette number 4?

25:45.077 --> 25:48.447
Because I don't think
she's like a real woman.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.816
She's looking like a--

25:50.816 --> 25:54.753
She's dressed up for Halloween
or something, you know?

25:54.753 --> 25:58.490
Like I think underneath
is like man or something,

25:58.490 --> 26:01.026
and you looks like
you have a big one.

26:01.026 --> 26:04.263
We're back at Season 4
with the Romper Room fuckery.

26:04.263 --> 26:07.699
Aggravation is not even
the word for it.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.635
I am beyond.

26:09.635 --> 26:11.470
Why are you talking to me?

26:11.470 --> 26:12.671
[laughs]

26:12.671 --> 26:14.973
Can someone come get
this little girl?

26:14.973 --> 26:16.608
Oh, my God.

26:17.843 --> 26:20.479
How did I get here?
What are we doing?

26:20.479 --> 26:21.480
Well, we're looking for love.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.915
I'm looking for love.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.683
Okay, but these?

26:24.683 --> 26:27.553
Della, you died
and you went to hell.

26:27.553 --> 26:28.620
That's why you're here.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.055
This is your hell, Della.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.624
You should have made
better choices in your life.

26:32.624 --> 26:33.725
[buzzer]

26:33.725 --> 26:36.528
Oh, Keiynan, that means
our time is up.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.096
It's decision time.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.332
Who do you choose?

26:40.332 --> 26:45.003
Is it going to be snatchlorette
number 1, number 2,

26:45.003 --> 26:48.006
number 3, or number 4?

26:48.006 --> 26:50.976
Well, I really like a woman
with a lot of experience,

26:50.976 --> 26:55.447
so I think I'm going to go
for snatchlorette number 2.

26:55.447 --> 26:59.084
Snatchlorette number 2.
All right.

26:59.084 --> 27:02.054
I'd like to thank
the Academy again.

27:02.054 --> 27:05.691
Hello, gorgeous.
You're looking pretty good.

27:05.691 --> 27:08.427
Before you meet
your dream snatch,

27:08.427 --> 27:11.230
say hello to Tiffany Haddish.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.232
Oh, you look like
you got good credit.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.200
Don't touch my purse.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.735
Jenny Bui.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.370
- Hello.
- Hi, Jenny.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.005
You so cute.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.040
Thank you, Ru.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.810
Thanks, Jenny.
And Della Reese.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.745
Young man, young man.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.447
You are handsome.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.048
Your loss. Next time.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.583
I know, I know.
I'm feeling it.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.719
Are you ready to meet
the snatch of your dreams?

27:33.719 --> 27:34.820
- I sure am, Ru.
- All right.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.923
Say hello to Barbra Streisand.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.659
Hello, gorgeous.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.628
You look so cute.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.196
Oh, I know
what me and James Brolin

27:44.196 --> 27:46.265
are gonna be doing tonight.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.034
[laughs]
Con-drag-ulations

27:49.034 --> 27:50.969
to our two snatches
made in heaven.

27:50.969 --> 27:55.741
On your dates, you will enjoy
a light snack at the airport,

27:55.741 --> 27:58.343
before you take
a connecting flight

27:58.343 --> 28:01.713
to the world famous
Pacific Ocean.

28:01.713 --> 28:04.449

28:04.449 --> 28:05.951
Thanks for watching.

28:05.951 --> 28:09.588
And remember,
love is only a snatch away.

28:09.588 --> 28:10.923
Good night, everybody.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.558
[applause]

28:12.558 --> 28:15.294
[laughs]

28:15.294 --> 28:16.962
A bunch of Democrats.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.366
Ahh...

28:21.366 --> 28:23.835
Welcome my cohosts,
my studio audience.

28:23.835 --> 28:24.970
Crown it.

28:24.970 --> 28:28.073
- Oh, she's back.
- Just a little drag.

28:28.073 --> 28:29.241
It is elimination day,

28:29.241 --> 28:32.244
and whoo, girl,
that Snatch Game was spicy.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.813
It was messy.
Whitney was not popping.

28:36.081 --> 28:40.419
Tell me what you think
of how Snatch Game went.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.087
Who do you think
is in the bottom?

28:42.087 --> 28:44.089
Gia Gunn.

28:46.525 --> 28:47.926
Train...

28:47.926 --> 28:50.028
Wreck.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.930
Your Caitlyn was hilarious.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.665
So good.
You were brilliant.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.367
Thank you.

28:55.367 --> 28:58.437
Besides Gia, who do you think
is gonna be in trouble?

28:58.437 --> 29:00.439
Monet.
And you are my friend,

29:00.439 --> 29:01.640
and I'm gonna be honest
with you.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.008
Mm-hmm.

29:03.008 --> 29:05.811
You were the character,
but you gotta make it funny.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.980
I know I started strong,
bitch.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.716
I poured my heart
and soul into it.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.417
And it's really frustrating

29:12.417 --> 29:15.320
because I was trying
to celebrate it,

29:15.320 --> 29:17.289
and bitch is over here putting
me in the bottom next to Gia,

29:17.289 --> 29:19.925
and I'm like, huh?

29:19.925 --> 29:22.327
Like I don't care
what anybody says,

29:22.327 --> 29:24.863
we know who is going home.

29:24.863 --> 29:28.333
But this might be the chance
to get off another player.

29:28.333 --> 29:29.935
You know what I mean?
Did you think about that?

29:29.935 --> 29:32.738
Based on yesterday's challenge,

29:32.738 --> 29:35.140
figuring Gia's
gonna be in the bottom,

29:35.140 --> 29:40.245
but we don't know who else
is going to be there with her.

29:40.245 --> 29:41.613
A really strong competitor

29:41.613 --> 29:43.915
could find themselves
in the bottom with Gia,

29:43.915 --> 29:46.551
and they could potentially
be eliminated.

29:46.551 --> 29:48.387
Latrice?

29:48.387 --> 29:50.355
I know that you were so annoyed
yesterday with the Snatch.

29:50.355 --> 29:53.892
I'm so--truly, truly, bitch.

29:53.892 --> 29:56.628
I mean, there's no excuse,
you know?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.730
I was ready to like actually
like have a good time with it.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.098
Yeah.

30:00.098 --> 30:03.368
I felt like I didn't get
a chance to get it all out.

30:03.368 --> 30:04.536
- I felt--
- Because why?

30:04.536 --> 30:06.204
I was distracted by you.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.206
It was not working.
It wasn't landing.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.341
Right.

30:09.341 --> 30:12.277
And at--unfortunately,
at my expense.

30:12.277 --> 30:15.147
I'm so sorry.
I didn't really realize--

30:15.147 --> 30:16.481
You were fucking everyone up,

30:16.481 --> 30:20.185
and it just felt like
you were doing it on purpose.

30:20.185 --> 30:22.087
That was not my intention.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.123
I feel very uncertain
right now

30:25.123 --> 30:27.459
with where I stand
in the competition,

30:27.459 --> 30:28.627
but most importantly,

30:28.627 --> 30:30.395
where I stand
with the other competitors.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.698
In the Snatch Game of Love,

30:32.698 --> 30:35.467
I wasn't trying
to take anybody's light.

30:35.467 --> 30:38.070
I was just desperately
trying to be funny,

30:38.070 --> 30:40.405
and I guess I tried too hard.

30:40.405 --> 30:42.708
It was like so frustrating.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.846
- Step into my salon.
- Step into my salon.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.848
- You could use a touchup,
too, Henny.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.718
Being on a dating show
was a little weird,

30:52.718 --> 30:54.186
especially because
I'm a married man.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.488
Yeah, that was
a little interesting.

30:56.488 --> 30:57.889
You're about
to get married, right?

30:57.889 --> 30:59.191
I am about to get married.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.792
It's happening so soon.

31:00.792 --> 31:03.829
Yes, God, getting married.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.130
Ta-ting.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.199
Hopefully you'll have
a pretty, shiny crown

31:07.199 --> 31:08.300
and $100.000--

31:08.300 --> 31:09.901
- To pay for it.
- To pay for your wedding.

31:09.901 --> 31:11.103
Whoo, that would be lovely.

31:11.103 --> 31:14.339
Growing up, coming from
a religious background,

31:14.339 --> 31:16.408
I was so conflicted all the time

31:16.408 --> 31:18.543
because they're
constantly telling me

31:18.543 --> 31:21.880
that all the things
that I was feeling inside me

31:21.880 --> 31:24.950
were my ticket to hell.

31:24.950 --> 31:29.020
Back then, I never thought
love, monogamy, family

31:29.020 --> 31:31.423
would be a possibility for me.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.125
I was unpacking
once we got here,

31:33.125 --> 31:35.260
and I found a note
from Christopher

31:35.260 --> 31:36.428
in the bottom of my tote.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.863
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.364
He just wanted to let me know

31:39.364 --> 31:41.466
that at all costs
that I had somebody

31:41.466 --> 31:44.636
that was at home waiting for me,
you know what I mean?

31:44.636 --> 31:46.638
And it's just like...

31:46.638 --> 31:48.406
it's the best feeling
in the world

31:48.406 --> 31:50.542
to have someone that's
in your corner no matter what,

31:50.542 --> 31:52.811
win, lose, draw.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.446
Unconditional love.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.114
I did fight the fight

31:56.114 --> 31:59.151
to help get marriage equality
passed in all 50 states.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.787
And knowing
that I could actually

32:01.787 --> 32:06.224
legally love
the person that I love

32:06.224 --> 32:07.592
and feel traditional

32:07.592 --> 32:11.463
was the biggest triumph
that I've ever felt.

32:11.463 --> 32:14.065
I had to date girls
when I was in high school.

32:14.065 --> 32:15.333
- Oh, really?
- Did you?

32:15.333 --> 32:17.169
- Yeah.
- Did you love any of them?

32:17.169 --> 32:19.004
I loved all my girlfriends.

32:19.004 --> 32:19.905
They were like my muses.

32:19.905 --> 32:21.072
I would dress them up,

32:21.072 --> 32:23.308
I would take pictures,
I would paint them.

32:23.308 --> 32:24.776
Did you have sex with them?

32:24.776 --> 32:26.077
- Yeah, hello.
- Oh, my God.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.612
Come on, bitch.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.214
- I can't.
- I think I could do it.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.316
[laughs]

32:31.316 --> 32:33.785
I'm gonna keep telling myself
I can, okay?

32:33.785 --> 32:35.053
Humans
are beautiful creatures.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.555
- Very bad.
- Some of them.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.889
What did you just say?

32:37.889 --> 32:39.090
Humans are beautiful creatures?

32:39.090 --> 32:41.359
Do you feel like we are alone?

32:41.359 --> 32:43.395
Like in terms
of like aliens and shit.

32:45.430 --> 32:46.765
I'm like, are there
alien drag queens?

32:46.765 --> 32:48.066
Who knows?

32:48.066 --> 32:50.001
Wait, what are you smoking,
because I need some.

32:50.001 --> 32:51.803
Pass it to
the left-hand side, girl.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.072
I really sit at night
thinking about that.

32:54.072 --> 32:56.107
Like if I'm just sitting there,
and in just my brain,

32:56.107 --> 32:57.175
I just always see like
a little black shadow

32:57.175 --> 32:58.243
right in the corner.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.244
Girl, you're just
seeing demons.

32:59.244 --> 33:02.280
You need to pray.

36:17.609 --> 36:20.612
Boots the House Down,
mama, yes. God. [cluck]

36:20.612 --> 36:22.247
Stunning from head to taupe.

36:22.247 --> 36:24.315
Yes. [laughs]

36:24.315 --> 36:27.986
Monique Heart.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.188
Her dogs ain't barking.
They're howling.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.256
[Michelle laughs]

36:31.256 --> 36:33.758
Little Red Riding Ho.

36:33.758 --> 36:35.126
[all laugh]

36:35.126 --> 36:37.829
On the runway, I'm giving
Little Red Riding Hood

36:37.829 --> 36:39.998
like, yo, I was going
to my grandma's house.

36:39.998 --> 36:41.599
The wolf rolled up on me,

36:41.599 --> 36:43.601
and I was like, oh, no, bitch.

36:43.601 --> 36:46.271
So I just shot them up
and made them some boots.

36:46.271 --> 36:49.140
Damn. Crafty queen.
How you doing?

36:49.140 --> 36:50.408
So, grandma, what's up?

36:50.408 --> 36:51.910
[all laugh]

36:51.910 --> 36:55.346
Manila Luzon.

36:55.346 --> 36:57.849
I'm sorry, Manila's
all tied up right now.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.918
[all laugh]

36:59.918 --> 37:01.386
I love that jewelry
in her mouth.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.088
How many carrots is that?

37:03.088 --> 37:04.322
[all laugh]

37:04.322 --> 37:06.458
I am serving you leather daddy

37:06.458 --> 37:08.893
Tom of Finland sex bunny.

37:08.893 --> 37:12.430
Ooh, I'm hopping down
the runway.

37:12.430 --> 37:15.100
Her safe word
is beta carotene.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.835
[all laugh]

37:16.835 --> 37:19.671
Up next, Gia Gunn.

37:19.671 --> 37:23.074
She wore blue denim.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.309
Honestly, she has good genes.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.877
[all laugh]

37:25.877 --> 37:28.613
My look is inspired
by Rhianna's denim look.

37:28.613 --> 37:31.049
I'm just giving you
blue, blue, blue,

37:31.049 --> 37:33.651
and more blue denim realness.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.453
The lightweight champion
of the world.

37:35.453 --> 37:37.055
She's got the belt to prove it.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.423
[all laugh]

37:38.423 --> 37:41.759
Latrice Royale.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.862
Oh, wow.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.530
Those boots are dripping.

37:45.530 --> 37:48.099
Do the curtains
match the drapes?

37:48.099 --> 37:49.667
[all laugh]

37:49.667 --> 37:53.037
I feel so good
just dripping in jewels,

37:53.037 --> 37:57.108
just shing-a-ling-a-ling-a,
shing-a-ling-a-ling-a.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.345
I have on pointy toe
and pointy spiked heel.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.914
This bitch is walking
this runway, honey.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.416
Boots the House Down.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.385
This tassel's
worth the hassle.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.654
Bitch is Can-Margaret.

38:09.654 --> 38:11.222
[all laugh]

38:11.222 --> 38:12.991
♪ She's a super queen ♪

38:12.991 --> 38:15.326
Welcome, All Stars.

38:15.326 --> 38:18.997
Now, based on your Snatch Game
of Love performances

38:18.997 --> 38:23.935
and your runway presentations,
I've made some decisions.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.173
When I call your name,
please step forward.

38:28.173 --> 38:29.974
Monet X Change.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.279
Monique Heart.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.983
You are both safe.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.285
Oh, thank you.

38:41.719 --> 38:44.088
You may step
to the back of the stage.

38:48.226 --> 38:52.697
Ladies, you are the tops
and bottoms of the week.

38:52.697 --> 38:55.366
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

38:58.436 --> 39:02.807
Ladies, you are the tops
and bottoms of the week.

39:02.807 --> 39:05.243
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

39:05.243 --> 39:08.947
First up, Naomi Smalls.

39:08.947 --> 39:12.183
So listen, Snatch Game
is important.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.451
I thought you did
a really good job,

39:13.451 --> 39:14.786
and I love Wendy Williams.

39:14.786 --> 39:15.853
She's such a character.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.255
You brought that costume

39:17.255 --> 39:19.457
that she famously was wearing
when she fainted,

39:19.457 --> 39:21.759
and we didn't see it coming.

39:21.759 --> 39:24.262
And that's how
you have to do Snatch Game.

39:24.262 --> 39:27.732
It started to fizzle
the more you went into it,

39:27.732 --> 39:30.401
but you were really strong
at the end.

39:30.401 --> 39:32.470
You love Wendy and it showed.
You were very funny.

39:32.470 --> 39:33.871
- Thank you.
- Let's talk about the runway.

39:33.871 --> 39:34.973
Boots The House Down.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.141
If I didn't know
the name of the challenge,

39:37.141 --> 39:38.943
I wouldn't know
it was a boots challenge.

39:38.943 --> 39:40.845
I agree.
I don't see a ton of boots,

39:40.845 --> 39:42.213
but you look gorgeous.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.848
Thank you so much, Gus.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.617
- Tch.
- [laughs]

39:45.617 --> 39:48.586
Up next, Trinity The Tuck.

39:48.586 --> 39:49.854
You look a million dollars.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.789
And I'm a huge
Michael Jackson fan,

39:51.789 --> 39:52.890
and there's something
about the buckles

39:52.890 --> 39:54.092
and the gold and the black

39:54.092 --> 39:55.960
that really reminds me
of the "History" era.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.462
It's just really special
and magical.

39:57.462 --> 39:59.063
In the Snatch Game,

39:59.063 --> 40:02.267
they say in Ireland, Jaysus!

40:02.267 --> 40:06.304
It was so fun
to watch you, Trinity.

40:06.304 --> 40:08.606
You were in character to a T.

40:08.606 --> 40:10.642
It was such a joy
to play with you.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.176
[laughs]

40:12.176 --> 40:14.178
This is how you do it.

40:14.178 --> 40:17.582
I think it's one of my favorite
Snatch Game performances ever.

40:19.984 --> 40:22.053
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.822
Up next, Valentina.

40:24.822 --> 40:28.826
Your runway look tonight,
honey, I'm here for it.

40:28.826 --> 40:30.428
I fell in love with you
on the runway.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.766
The idea of this, Valentina,
it makes my mouth water.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.067
When you walk,

40:36.067 --> 40:38.403
the crotch kept getting lower
and lower and lower.

40:38.403 --> 40:40.038
All that we were looking at
was that,

40:40.038 --> 40:43.107
instead of seeing
the beauty that it is.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.543
Okay, I can tell that you
researched Eartha Kitt a lot.

40:45.543 --> 40:47.345
But what you have to do is you
have to do all that homework,

40:47.345 --> 40:48.579
know all that stuff,

40:48.579 --> 40:51.482
and then wad it up
and throw it away and have fun.

40:51.482 --> 40:53.851
And that's what was missing
for me a little bit was the fun.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.253
The jokes weren't landing

40:55.253 --> 40:57.522
because they weren't relevant
to the question.

40:57.522 --> 40:59.357
I think you really
kept struggling

40:59.357 --> 41:00.425
to be in the moment.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.893
I feel like
you focused a little less

41:01.893 --> 41:03.461
on answering the questions

41:03.461 --> 41:05.430
and sort of said
what you wanted,

41:05.430 --> 41:08.266
which kind of made it hard
playing with you in the game.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.467
Thank you.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.736
Up next, Manila Luzon.

41:11.736 --> 41:13.504
What's up, doc?

41:13.504 --> 41:15.306
[all laugh]

41:15.306 --> 41:17.408
I'm really glad you decided
to keep your outfit

41:17.408 --> 41:19.510
- from our date.
- [laughs]

41:19.510 --> 41:20.978
This is what we want to see
from Manila.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.547
You're quirky and fun.

41:22.547 --> 41:25.483
And sexy.
You forgot sexy.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.784
[all laugh]

41:26.784 --> 41:28.286
Your Snatch was awesome.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.388
Clearly I liked it
'cause I chose you.

41:30.388 --> 41:31.889
I choose you, too.

41:31.889 --> 41:33.424
Yay. Love.

41:33.424 --> 41:35.727
What I loved
is that you were a caricature

41:35.727 --> 41:39.230
of a caricature of Barbra.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.932
I don't know
what shifted for you

41:40.932 --> 41:44.402
between last week and this week,
but something happened.

41:44.402 --> 41:47.505
There's a confidence there,
and it's fantastic.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.539
Thank you.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.508
Up next, Gia Gunn.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.678
Your look tonight, I wish
I was wearing that every day.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.046
[laughs] Thank you.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.681
You kind of are.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.549
I mean, I look pretty good,
but you look great.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.685
All right, let's talk about
the Snatch Game.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.620
I wasn't familiar with Jenny,

42:02.620 --> 42:06.257
and so I thought maybe
I wasn't getting the jokes.

42:06.257 --> 42:07.425
I know who she is.

42:07.425 --> 42:10.161
She has an incredible story
of emigrating

42:10.161 --> 42:13.598
and being poverty-stricken
and go through the war

42:13.598 --> 42:15.800
and it was unbelievable
what she went through.

42:15.800 --> 42:20.271
But you played her
almost like a ho.

42:20.271 --> 42:23.975
I couldn't get behind you
in the Snatch Game.

42:23.975 --> 42:26.210
I couldn't get
behind me, either. [laughs]

42:26.210 --> 42:29.280
It actually felt
kind of uncomfortable to watch,

42:29.280 --> 42:32.483
and I felt like you kind of
dragged Latrice down.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.753
Mm-hmm. I definitely expected
to be receiving these comments.

42:35.753 --> 42:38.289
It is the most difficult
challenge

42:38.289 --> 42:39.690
I think that exists.

42:39.690 --> 42:42.193
It's a really hard thing to do.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.896
With that being said,
I think that you being here

42:44.896 --> 42:47.331
as representation
for the trans community

42:47.331 --> 42:49.667
does a lot for trans people
watching the show.

42:49.667 --> 42:51.335
And you won't even
realize the impact,

42:51.335 --> 42:52.770
but it's very large.

42:52.770 --> 42:54.539
Thank you.

42:54.539 --> 42:57.375
All right,
Up next, Latrice Royale.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.177
When you walked out tonight,

42:59.177 --> 43:01.746
I could hear the whole club
stand up and scream.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.549
It's just so show business.

43:04.549 --> 43:05.716
Thank you.

43:05.716 --> 43:07.518
Let's go to the Snatch Game.

43:07.518 --> 43:09.053
Della Reese.

43:09.053 --> 43:11.155
Started out strong.

43:11.155 --> 43:14.492
Then I think that you
started to get affected.

43:14.492 --> 43:16.928
I know when
you're out there on the road,

43:16.928 --> 43:19.664
people are throwing up bottles,
you've got competitive queens,

43:19.664 --> 43:21.299
you've got people heckling you
from the audience.

43:21.299 --> 43:22.366
And I've seen you.

43:22.366 --> 43:24.569
Nothing throws you off.

43:24.569 --> 43:27.939
And this is the biggest stage
in the world.

43:27.939 --> 43:30.775
It got really personal.

43:30.775 --> 43:34.045
Like the digs
about me being a man and big

43:34.045 --> 43:35.179
and all that kind of stuff,

43:35.179 --> 43:38.382
it's like
unsportsmanlike conduct.

43:39.917 --> 43:43.187
Now, based on
the judges' critiques,

43:43.187 --> 43:45.122
I've made some decisions.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.092
Trinity The Tuck.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.729
Manila Luzon.

43:53.030 --> 43:55.867
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.235
[applause]

43:57.235 --> 43:58.569
Con-drag-ulations.

44:00.138 --> 44:03.074
You've each won
a set of suitcases,

44:03.074 --> 44:07.145
including an everywhere bag,
from Away luggage,

44:07.145 --> 44:10.348
plus airfare
and a five-night stay

44:10.348 --> 44:13.084
at the Grand Resort
Hotel and Spa

44:13.084 --> 44:15.119
in Fort Lauderdale.

44:15.119 --> 44:17.822
- All right.
- Oh, fabulous.

44:17.822 --> 44:20.658
Naomi Smalls, you're safe.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.226
Thank you.

44:22.226 --> 44:24.395
Latrice Royale.

44:26.297 --> 44:29.367
You are safe.

44:29.367 --> 44:33.371
That means Valentina
and Gia Gunn,

44:33.371 --> 44:36.174
you are the bottom two.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.910
Trinity and Manila,

44:38.910 --> 44:42.613
each of you needs to decide
which of the bottom two

44:42.613 --> 44:46.150
you'll eliminate
if you win the lip sync.

44:46.150 --> 44:49.587
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

44:49.587 --> 44:54.525
the judges and I will watch
Gus and Keiynan wrestle.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.993
Ooh.

44:55.993 --> 44:57.828
We don't have to deliberate.

44:57.828 --> 44:59.964
[all laugh]

44:59.964 --> 45:02.333
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.003
I gotta get a drink, girl.

45:06.003 --> 45:09.373
Going into this week,
I knew I had a lot to prove.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.442
But now I think that I'm showing

45:11.442 --> 45:13.344
that I am an All Star.

45:13.344 --> 45:16.280
A celebratory drink.

45:16.280 --> 45:17.748
Can I talk to you
by ourselves?

45:17.748 --> 45:19.283
- Sure.
- I pulled Manila

45:19.283 --> 45:21.252
over to the side as soon
as we get into the workroom.

45:21.252 --> 45:23.621
because I wanna know
where her head space is.

45:23.621 --> 45:25.623
This morning she says
she may send home

45:25.623 --> 45:27.825
a strong competitor.

45:27.825 --> 45:30.461
To me, there's a clear person
who needs to go home,

45:30.461 --> 45:32.129
and that's Gia.

45:32.129 --> 45:34.832
I want to know, like,
how are you really feeling

45:34.832 --> 45:36.634
about like how you're
going to go tonight.

45:36.634 --> 45:39.870
Well, I don't know.

45:41.606 --> 45:44.642
Gia can be a mess,
but will keeping her

45:44.642 --> 45:46.143
and showing her
a little bit of grace

45:46.143 --> 45:48.713
like be what can help her
grow as a person?

45:48.713 --> 45:49.981
Okay.

45:49.981 --> 45:53.150
Valentina is one of
the strongest competitors

45:53.150 --> 45:55.219
in "Drag Race" herstory.

45:55.219 --> 45:56.487
We have her in a corner.

45:56.487 --> 46:00.424
There is red lights
flashing in my mind, girl.

46:00.424 --> 46:02.827
Alert, alert, alert, alert.

46:02.827 --> 46:06.263
You know
if you send Valentina home,

46:06.263 --> 46:10.334
it's going to send
the whole rest of everything

46:10.334 --> 46:12.837
into like a whirlwind.

46:12.837 --> 46:15.072
Are you prepared for that?

46:15.072 --> 46:16.874
I'm not sure yet.

46:16.874 --> 46:18.976
I can be strategic.

46:18.976 --> 46:21.879
I could keep a weak link in here

46:21.879 --> 46:24.749
because I know
it'll always make me look good,

46:24.749 --> 46:28.285
and send home a strong player
like Valentina,

46:28.285 --> 46:31.355
it would change
how everyone from now on

46:31.355 --> 46:32.857
played the game

46:32.857 --> 46:36.360
and maybe get me closer
to that crown.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.129
Okay.

46:39.430 --> 46:41.032
How are you feeling,
Valentina?

46:41.032 --> 46:45.002
I just feel like...
gorgeous right now.

46:45.002 --> 46:47.838
I'm in the bottom,
but I'm proud of myself.

46:47.838 --> 46:50.641
Am I supposed to feel
ashamed for it?

46:50.641 --> 46:53.678
In my heart,
I know I did my very best,

46:53.678 --> 46:55.246
and I deserve to stay.

46:55.246 --> 46:57.448
I have my head held high.

46:57.448 --> 47:00.584
I handle everything with grace
'cause I'm a pageant girl.

47:00.584 --> 47:01.719
That's a very mature way
to look at it.

47:01.719 --> 47:02.820
That is very mature.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.422
I'm like, yes, Valentina.

47:04.422 --> 47:06.123
I've never done a pageant,
but in my mind,

47:06.123 --> 47:07.792
I am Miss Venezuela, bitch.

47:07.792 --> 47:11.195
[laughs]

47:13.898 --> 47:16.634
I'm feeling very alone.

47:16.634 --> 47:20.404
In this moment, I definitely
feel like the black sheep.

47:23.641 --> 47:25.543
How do you feel?

47:25.543 --> 47:27.278
It's not about me right now.
This is about you.

47:27.278 --> 47:29.447
I didn't really expect

47:29.447 --> 47:33.050
competing in a drag competition
as a transgender woman

47:33.050 --> 47:35.686
to be so hard and so emotional.

47:35.686 --> 47:38.122
I'm overwhelmed.

47:38.122 --> 47:39.657
You did terrible.

47:39.657 --> 47:41.525
And I can't even
be mad about that

47:41.525 --> 47:42.626
- because I know.
- You can't.

47:42.626 --> 47:44.895
You went to a place
that was dark.

47:44.895 --> 47:46.330
It made me angry.

47:46.330 --> 47:49.867
I was in a really,
really emotional state.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.902
- Tell me why.
- Um...

47:53.637 --> 47:56.173
I don't know. I just wish
that there was another way

47:56.173 --> 47:57.708
for me to do this,

47:57.708 --> 48:01.712
to show you can be
whoever you want to be.

48:01.712 --> 48:04.749
As a transwoman,

48:04.749 --> 48:08.085
I don't feel good about
being looked at

48:08.085 --> 48:10.788
like a man dressed up
as a woman,

48:10.788 --> 48:13.157
because that's not who I am.

48:13.157 --> 48:15.493
I just wanna be me.

48:17.094 --> 48:18.929
Once upon a time,

48:18.929 --> 48:20.598
dressing in drag for me

48:20.598 --> 48:24.635
was me being able to
connect with who I really am.

48:24.635 --> 48:27.838
But now that I've connected
with who I really am,

48:27.838 --> 48:31.108
to come back here, it becomes
very confusing for me.

48:31.108 --> 48:33.010
It kind of brings back
Gia Gunn Season 6

48:33.010 --> 48:35.379
and those old bad habits,

48:35.379 --> 48:36.881
like being shady
or being negative

48:36.881 --> 48:38.983
or being cutthroat.

48:38.983 --> 48:41.819
It was a defense mechanism.

48:41.819 --> 48:47.458
It's really sad for me to hear
I was insulting people

48:47.458 --> 48:48.692
during the Snatch Game.

48:48.692 --> 48:51.262
I know, and that
is not who you are,

48:51.262 --> 48:52.930
who you want to be.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.833
As I'm talking to Gia,
I feel for her.

48:55.833 --> 48:58.836
She has got
a lot on her plate,

48:58.836 --> 49:00.538
more than just the competition.

49:00.538 --> 49:01.639
I love you, Gia.

49:01.639 --> 49:03.741
I love you, too.

49:03.741 --> 49:05.810
Oh, girl.

49:08.312 --> 49:10.381
So we need to talk.

49:10.381 --> 49:14.919
I went up there
to see how she was gonna judge,

49:14.919 --> 49:16.821
and she brought up
the big possibility

49:16.821 --> 49:18.856
of, well,
I'll send Valentina home

49:18.856 --> 49:20.791
because she's competition.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.727
So you think
I could go home tonight.

49:23.727 --> 49:27.464
Manila might want
to send me home.

49:27.464 --> 49:28.866
[gasps]

49:28.866 --> 49:32.136

49:33.470 --> 49:35.439
I don't see you going home.

49:35.439 --> 49:37.475
You've got to be
in top four with me

49:37.475 --> 49:39.276
at the end with me.

49:39.276 --> 49:44.882
So I'm gonna try to win
this lip sync for you.

49:44.882 --> 49:47.451
You go win that lip sync,
girl.

49:47.451 --> 49:50.187
I will. I'm going to.

49:50.187 --> 49:51.789
I want to be
up there with you

49:51.789 --> 49:54.558
at the end of this competition.

49:54.558 --> 49:57.161
Valentina can't go home

49:57.161 --> 49:59.430
because, one, I don't want
to have to deal with Gia

49:59.430 --> 50:00.497
for another week.

50:00.497 --> 50:02.933
Two, Valentina is my friend,

50:02.933 --> 50:04.969
and she doesn't deserve
to go home.

50:04.969 --> 50:07.037
[slurping] Bitch,
can I have your cocktail?

50:07.037 --> 50:09.406
- My feet hurt.
- Yeah. Eat it.

50:10.774 --> 50:12.543
Have you guys been told
that your drag character's

50:12.543 --> 50:13.978
like any famous celebrities?

50:13.978 --> 50:15.546
Just 'cause I wear
lots of short blonde wigs,

50:15.546 --> 50:16.714
they're always saying
NeNe Leakes,

50:16.714 --> 50:17.715
but there's nothing NeNe Leakes
about me.

50:17.715 --> 50:19.383

50:27.791 --> 50:30.527
- I love you.
- No, don't start, bitch.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.999
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

50:34.999 --> 50:36.066
You killed it.

50:36.066 --> 50:38.335
I want you to win this.

50:38.335 --> 50:40.437
Not only because
I love you as a friend,

50:40.437 --> 50:42.306
- but you deserve it.
- Thank you.

50:42.306 --> 50:44.675
I'm gonna tell you something.

50:44.675 --> 50:47.011
Your heart
is in the right place,

50:47.011 --> 50:49.914
and no matter what,
you need to know

50:49.914 --> 50:52.783
that you are deserving
and you are accepted.

50:53.918 --> 50:57.755
You are one of
the fiercest queens

50:57.755 --> 51:02.293
to ever compete
in this competition, Valentina.

51:02.293 --> 51:04.428
And that scares me,
because I'm like, oh, my God.

51:04.428 --> 51:06.397
How can I keep up
with these young girls?

51:06.397 --> 51:07.464
[slurps]

51:07.464 --> 51:09.700

51:12.069 --> 51:15.439
and I could...I could
be like, you know what?

51:15.439 --> 51:17.308
Let's get rid of
the strongest competition,

51:17.308 --> 51:18.642
and the rest of it
could be a cakewalk.

51:20.544 --> 51:23.647
I really want you to know

51:23.647 --> 51:26.283
I feel I've done so good here,

51:26.283 --> 51:28.218
and I want to stay.

51:28.218 --> 51:30.888
How about this?

51:33.524 --> 51:36.293
You promise me
if you ever land in the top

51:36.293 --> 51:37.695
and I land in the bottom,

51:37.695 --> 51:41.932
show me grace
for an old-ass bitch like me.

51:41.932 --> 51:44.635
That's something
I wouldn't ever

51:44.635 --> 51:47.938
ask you to promise me to do.

51:49.740 --> 51:52.910
This is a game
of creating alliances.

51:52.910 --> 51:56.213
But Manila?
I can't trust this bitch.

51:56.213 --> 51:58.115
I can't trust her.

51:58.115 --> 52:01.151
I mean, when a girl
tells you, like, hmm.

52:01.151 --> 52:03.554
What if I send you home 'cause
you're fierce competition?

52:03.554 --> 52:06.724
Ha ha ha.
No, bitch. No.

52:06.724 --> 52:08.459
What I can tell you

52:08.459 --> 52:11.562
is that I do see myself

52:11.562 --> 52:13.597
being in the top

52:13.597 --> 52:16.367
competing against
your fierce ass.

52:16.367 --> 52:18.902
That's a fucking challenge
I want to put on you.

52:18.902 --> 52:22.139
Can you handle it, you know?

52:22.139 --> 52:24.842

Con-drag-ulations.

56:53.610 --> 56:57.881
You've earned a cash tip
of $10.000.

56:57.881 --> 56:59.049
Thank you.

56:59.049 --> 57:02.152
Trinity, you are safe.

57:02.152 --> 57:03.287
You may join the other girls.

57:03.287 --> 57:04.454
Thank you, Ru.

57:06.156 --> 57:08.792
Will the bottom two
please step forward.

57:16.266 --> 57:20.971
Manila, with great power
comes great responsibility.

57:22.205 --> 57:26.209
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

57:26.209 --> 57:28.879
I've done this competition
a few times,

57:28.879 --> 57:31.581
and I know
we all want this so bad.

57:31.581 --> 57:33.483
But I want it the most.

57:33.483 --> 57:36.119
I've been wanting it the longest
out of any of these queens.

57:36.119 --> 57:40.157
So the queen I chose
is an amazing person.

57:40.157 --> 57:43.527
I've been a fan of hers
since I saw her first on TV.

57:43.527 --> 57:45.595
I'm going to continue
to be a fan of hers

57:45.595 --> 57:46.797
even after this.

57:47.998 --> 57:50.367
But I'm sorry to say...

57:51.568 --> 57:52.936
Gia.

57:55.806 --> 57:56.807
I'm sorry, girl.

57:56.807 --> 57:58.175
Love you.

58:00.310 --> 58:01.778
I think you deserve it.

58:01.778 --> 58:03.480
My dear Gia,

58:03.480 --> 58:07.617
as it is written,
so it shall be done.

58:07.617 --> 58:11.488
You are and will always be
an All Star.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.756
I just want to say thank you

58:12.756 --> 58:16.693
for allowing me to be here
in my authentic skin.

58:16.693 --> 58:19.596
I will continue
to inspire the world to know

58:19.596 --> 58:22.432
that they and we are all stars.

58:22.432 --> 58:23.433
Thank you.

58:23.433 --> 58:26.870
Now sashay away.

58:26.870 --> 58:29.039
[applause]

58:29.039 --> 58:30.140
Love you.

58:30.140 --> 58:31.308
I'm sorry.

58:35.345 --> 58:37.447
- Love you, girls.
- Love you.

58:43.987 --> 58:46.957
I'm not surprised
with the outcome of tonight

58:46.957 --> 58:50.193
because I feel like I kind of
brought this on myself.

58:50.193 --> 58:53.430
I would have liked
to continue this journey,

58:53.430 --> 58:57.667
but I can walk away knowing
that I shared my true talent

58:57.667 --> 59:00.470
and I stirred up some drama.

59:00.470 --> 59:01.872
Being here at "All Stars"
has shown me

59:01.872 --> 59:05.208
that although I am
living my life as a woman,

59:05.208 --> 59:08.578
I'm still learning about
what kind of woman I am.

59:08.578 --> 59:10.747
I am an All Star.

59:10.747 --> 59:13.283
Regardless of how far I got,

59:13.283 --> 59:15.952
I know that I have something
to offer this world.

59:15.952 --> 59:19.656
At the end of the day,
that's all that I need.

59:19.656 --> 59:22.325
Con-drag-ulations, All Stars.

59:22.325 --> 59:24.761
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:24.761 --> 59:27.097
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

59:27.097 --> 59:28.598
Can I get an amen up in here?

59:28.598 --> 59:30.233
- Amen.
- All right.

59:30.233 --> 59:31.701
Now let the music play.

59:33.270 --> 59:34.805
♪ I'm telling the truth now ♪

59:34.805 --> 59:38.542
♪ We're all born naked
and the rest is drag ♪

59:38.542 --> 59:40.177
♪ Who, who ♪

59:40.177 --> 59:41.511
♪ Who do you think you-- ♪

59:41.511 --> 59:46.416
♪ We're all born naked
and the rest is drag ♪

59:49.152 --> 59:51.087
Next time on "All Stars..."

59:51.087 --> 59:54.391
You'll be appearing
on a twisted daytime court show,

59:54.391 --> 59:56.293
"Jersey Justice."

59:56.293 --> 59:57.961
This is my courtroom!

59:57.961 --> 59:59.529
You don't talk to me that way.

59:59.529 --> 1:00:00.697
What's your name?

1:00:00.697 --> 1:00:03.467
Tiffani with two I's
dotted with hearts.

1:00:03.467 --> 1:00:05.802
Where are the jokes?

1:00:05.802 --> 1:00:07.504
- Bitch!
- Oh!

1:00:07.504 --> 1:00:10.373
Oh, my God! Oh!

1:00:10.373 --> 1:00:12.042
I'm about to throw this case
out the window.

1:00:12.042 --> 1:00:13.844
Uh...

1:00:13.844 --> 1:00:16.513
I am deeply offended.

1:00:16.513 --> 1:00:18.215
She knows what she did.

1:00:18.215 --> 1:00:20.484
Horrible.
What if I'm in the bottom two?

1:00:20.484 --> 1:00:21.918
I'm sending your ass home,
bitch.

1:00:21.918 --> 1:00:24.287
You what?

1:00:24.287 --> 1:00:26.122
