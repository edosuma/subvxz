WEBVTT

00:09.661 --> 00:11.968
Yo, Em.
It's after 8:00.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.057
You should be
finishing homework.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.059
MAN:
This is where I get into
bad zombie nonsense...

00:16.103 --> 00:17.060
Emma?

00:17.104 --> 00:18.496
[gunfire, screaming on TV]

00:20.107 --> 00:21.543
MAN:
L1477,

00:21.586 --> 00:24.894
thank you so much
for your six-month sub.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.243
I appreciate you.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.462
Em.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.029
What are you doing down here?

00:29.072 --> 00:30.900
Maintaining a full
A.P. course load.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.206
What are you
doing down here?

00:32.249 --> 00:34.121
We talked about
playing video games

00:34.164 --> 00:35.513
and using your brain.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.472
You can't do both
at the same time.

00:37.515 --> 00:40.083
Rude. And I'm not
playing video games.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.084
I'm watching them.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.346
Don't get cute with me.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.782
I just got out
of a nine-hour surgery

00:43.826 --> 00:45.523
Haven't even showered yet.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.568
Gross.

00:46.611 --> 00:47.786
And I'm not being cute.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.092
I'm livestreaming.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.486
The zombie horde is back...

00:51.529 --> 00:53.140
People record themselves
playing video games

00:53.183 --> 00:55.055
and broadcast it
live on the Internet.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.057
You've heard
of the Internet, right?

00:58.145 --> 00:59.189
I put this on in the background.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.103
It's calming.

01:00.147 --> 01:03.106
All I see
is zombie homicide.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.152
Oh, and a strange man
in my little girl's room.

01:05.195 --> 01:07.110
And hey, if you're
just tuning in,

01:07.154 --> 01:08.546
make sure to hit
that follow button.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.331
You know this guy?

01:10.374 --> 01:13.812
Not personally. I'm just
one of his thousands of subs.

01:13.856 --> 01:17.033
Whatever happened to listening
to music while you study?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.643
Mom, don't be old.

01:18.687 --> 01:19.862
Hey.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.211
[gunshots]

01:21.255 --> 01:22.473
See?

01:22.517 --> 01:25.172
These games are just
getting so realistic.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.349
Mom, I just told you

01:28.392 --> 01:30.177
that's not part of the game.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.135
That's him
in real life.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.919
Oh, my God.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.098
â™ª

02:06.343 --> 02:10.304
Right, so I packed Phineas'
toiletries and his pajamas

02:10.347 --> 02:12.610
for tonight and a change
of clothes for tomorrow,

02:12.654 --> 02:15.004
including his favorite
Iron Man boxer shorts.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.180
Mom, that's personal business.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.965
Well, it's Agent Gibbs'
business now.

02:20.009 --> 02:23.143
He needs to make sure you wear
clean undies to school tomorrow.

02:23.186 --> 02:24.318
Oh, Mom.Thank you,

02:24.361 --> 02:25.797
again, for
watching him.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.190
This trip is last minute,

02:27.234 --> 02:29.714
but I hate to pull
Phineas out of school.

02:29.758 --> 02:32.152
And since we arrived, I
haven't found a reliable sitter.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.805
Sure, no problem.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.373
Not to mention,
Phineas doesn't know

02:36.417 --> 02:39.246
about my custody battle
with his father and I...

02:39.289 --> 02:41.161
I don't want him to.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.772
I have full maternal custody,
and yet I'm the one

02:43.815 --> 02:45.861
who has to appear
in a courthouse in New York.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.819
Go.
Do what you got to do.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.343
[short laugh]

02:49.386 --> 02:51.083
Here I am, talking
about being maternal.

02:51.127 --> 02:53.216
I'm about to leave my son
with a strange man

02:53.260 --> 02:54.435
who lives across the street.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.219
No offense.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.265
Phineas will be safe.

02:58.308 --> 02:59.353
Thank you.

02:59.396 --> 03:00.180
You're welcome.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.181
Phineas.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.748
Come give me a hug.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.402
Be good.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.187
And I'll be back
by tomorrow night.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.189
Yeah? I love you.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.625
I love you,
too, Mom.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.453
Right.

03:12.496 --> 03:15.064
Okay, remember,
school by 8:00,

03:15.107 --> 03:17.066
bed by 9:00,
and no screens.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.763
You really have
to watch kids these days.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.072
[door opens]What?

03:23.115 --> 03:24.160
You heard her.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.335
[door closes]No screens.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.996
[both laugh]

03:35.345 --> 03:37.173
Yeah.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.870
Come on, that's all I got.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.263
You're still holding.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.266
Ah.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.269
Ah.

03:47.531 --> 03:50.012
I thought staying here
was supposed to be fun.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.231
What do you mean?

03:51.274 --> 03:52.275
This is fun.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.755
Come on, we're late.What?

03:53.798 --> 03:55.235
Time for school.
Grab your gear.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.236
Why?

03:56.279 --> 03:57.367
It's too early.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.761
Well, if you're
not early...

03:59.804 --> 04:01.850
you're late.

04:04.069 --> 04:05.288
Morning, men.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.376
Morning.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.423
What's this?It's for drinking.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.033
Gibbs called in late,
so I had time to stop.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.600
My treat.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.689
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, still listening.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.647
You know, this is
the third time this month

04:16.691 --> 04:18.127
we beat Gibbs to the office.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.824
Yeah, and he's been
leaving early, too.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.478
I know, it's almost as if...

04:21.522 --> 04:23.915
he developed a life
outside of work.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.656
Nah.
Doesn't sound right.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.659
Well, I am not complaining,
because the less he's here,

04:28.703 --> 04:30.357
the less we are.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.836
Well, not today.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.273
What, we got a body?

04:33.316 --> 04:34.883
That's what we got
to find out.

04:34.926 --> 04:37.015
Just got off the phone
with NCIS Cyber

04:37.059 --> 04:39.888
about a possible murder
on a gamer livestream.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.411
Uh, McGee?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.412
Translate.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.240
Live TV for video games.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.155
911 operators
all over the country

04:46.198 --> 04:48.244
are getting calls about
an online shooting.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.724
GAMER: Make sure to hit
that follow button.

04:49.767 --> 04:53.423
Thanky-panky.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.382
Hey.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.166
[gunshots]

04:57.209 --> 04:58.167
Damn.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.430
Whoa.
Is this real?

05:00.474 --> 05:01.605
Thousands of followers
were watching live

05:01.649 --> 05:03.346
when it happened,
then the feed

05:03.390 --> 05:04.913
went dead.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.308
I mean, that's got
to be fake, right?

05:08.351 --> 05:10.048
Yeah, a stunt to
attract followers?

05:10.092 --> 05:11.354
Wh-Why call us?

05:11.398 --> 05:14.270
Well, 911 had no ID
for the supposed victim.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.532
They called NCIS

05:15.576 --> 05:19.449
because the guy's
screen name was "NAVYgamer-Z."

05:19.493 --> 05:20.842
Cyber did
some digging.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.452
Traced the username to

05:22.496 --> 05:24.846
Petty Officer First
Class Ian Rojas.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.587
His apartment
is in Bethesda.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.589
He's Navy and
he's local.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.373
Well, this video game nerd
is about to get

05:30.417 --> 05:32.027
a visit from the cool kids.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.724
Plus McGee.

05:33.768 --> 05:34.725
Uh...

05:34.769 --> 05:36.161
No offense.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.512
None taken.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.081
[knocking]

05:43.125 --> 05:45.910
McGEE:
Petty Officer Rojas?

05:45.954 --> 05:48.522
TORRES:
NCIS. Open the door.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.132
[pounding]

05:51.786 --> 05:53.048
Lock is broken.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.746
Ready?Yeah.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.802
Clear.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.372
McGEE:
Well, no body.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.156
Lots of blood.

06:14.199 --> 06:17.420
And it doesn't look like corn
syrup with red food coloring.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.726
TORRES:
Uh, yo.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.162
We got a body.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.037
I think we found
our petty officer.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.562
What do you mean,
"you think"?

06:31.478 --> 06:33.349
Oh. Okay.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.046
Uh, what are
we looking at?

06:35.090 --> 06:37.266
Well, let's confirm
who we're looking at.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.057
Oh...

06:46.101 --> 06:47.798
Yeah, that's our petty officer.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.801
And that's a lot
of gold glitter.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.151
Hey, McGee, translate.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.197
Don't look at me.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.469
Hey.[gunshots]

07:06.513 --> 07:08.471
Judging by the video,

07:08.515 --> 07:10.081
the shooter was standing

07:10.125 --> 07:12.475
right about... here.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.825
Well, the victim had no direct
line of sight to the front door.

07:14.869 --> 07:18.046
He was probably so into
the game he never heard

07:18.089 --> 07:19.351
the killer break the lock.

07:19.395 --> 07:20.875
Talked to the neighbors.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.138
They thought the gunshots
were from more video games.

07:23.181 --> 07:24.661
Well, this guy
was into everything from

07:24.705 --> 07:28.012
zombie shooters to RPGs.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.014
[sighs]
You know, there is nothing

07:30.058 --> 07:31.581
like video game binging.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.844
I mean, it's just you,

07:33.888 --> 07:35.803
junk food and your gaming rig.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.326
Those were the days.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.762
Were?

07:38.806 --> 07:41.069
Yeah, well, I-I, you know,
I've got kids now,

07:41.112 --> 07:42.984
Ah.so my free time
is at a premium.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.160
But I still got my finger

07:45.203 --> 07:47.075
on the pulse
of the video game world.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.469
It's why Gibbs
calls me Elf Lord.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.993
He does.Prove it.
What do we know?

07:52.036 --> 07:54.212
Well, boss, thanks
to our webcam video,

07:54.256 --> 07:56.824
we've got cause
and time of death.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.174
Three gunshots at 8:17 p.m.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.219
Camera see who did this?No.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.612
Our killer cut the feed.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.484
I'd check the
computer for more,

08:04.527 --> 08:05.833
but it's completely wiped.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.269
Whoever did this
was techy enough

08:07.312 --> 08:08.313
to cover their tracks.

08:08.357 --> 08:09.880
Body?

08:09.924 --> 08:11.708
After the shooting,

08:11.752 --> 08:14.319
the body was moved
to the bathroom...

08:14.363 --> 08:17.322
which is where
it gets a little weird.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.152
Glitter.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.198
This stuff
gets everywhere.

08:23.241 --> 08:26.288
I swear, Victoria
uses it on one craft

08:26.331 --> 08:30.335
project, and I'm picking out of
my hair for the next two weeks.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.467
This guy got it worse, though.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.860
Yeah, in
addition

08:32.903 --> 08:35.558
to pouring glitter
all over his face,

08:35.602 --> 08:37.081
someone dumped even more

08:37.125 --> 08:39.823
directly down his throat.

08:41.477 --> 08:45.350
Oh, that is the stuff
of daddy nightmares.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.309
Glitter was postmortem.Yes.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.485
The, uh, three gunshot wounds

08:49.529 --> 08:52.923
to the chest likely killed
Petty Officer Rojas instantly.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.925
Everything that
followed was

08:54.969 --> 08:56.231
strictly for show.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.407
The glitter,
the teddy bear mask--

08:58.450 --> 09:00.322
this looks personal.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.411
Prints?Nothing on the mask,

09:02.454 --> 09:04.413
but the name Rojas
is written inside.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.546
Belongs to our victim.Yep.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.504
Hey, listen,
it could be a sex thing.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.201
People are
into that.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.289
Yeah, they're called furries.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.771
I've heard.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.860
It's not a sex thing.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.909
That's our teddy bear.

09:21.952 --> 09:24.346
And it's shooting
gold glitter.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.306
[whoops]

09:28.350 --> 09:30.482
McGEE:
The video game Killing

09:30.526 --> 09:33.790
with Kindness 3.You play as
teddy bears who kill each other

09:33.834 --> 09:36.488
using glitter guns
and rainbow grenades.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.447
That actually
sounds kind of fun.

09:39.535 --> 09:40.710
I had three older brothers.

09:40.754 --> 09:41.842
You know, I didn't get much

09:41.885 --> 09:44.322
Nintendo time in.Mm.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.064
KwK3is a less-violent
third-person shooter

09:47.108 --> 09:49.632
that's more about world building
and social interaction.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.721
Here's a silly
question.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.114
Adults play this?

09:53.157 --> 09:55.464
This is one of the biggest
video games in the world.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.640
And I had no idea
it even existed.

09:57.684 --> 10:01.078
Well, you did say you don't
play that much these days.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.340
Well, yeah, but I had no idea

10:02.384 --> 10:03.515
I was this far out of the loop.

10:03.559 --> 10:04.908
I mean,
this is terrible.

10:04.952 --> 10:08.738
So is murder, Tim.
Go. Victim.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.306
Uh, Petty Officer
First Class Rojas.Yeah, he was

10:11.349 --> 10:12.916
living two
different lives.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.526
One in the real world
and the other online.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.398
Start with real world.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.878
Rojas was
employed aboard

10:17.921 --> 10:20.532
the U.S.S. Gray
as a hull technician.

10:20.576 --> 10:23.535
Metal worker--
that's a tough duty assignment.

10:23.579 --> 10:26.147
Nothing but good things from
his shipmates and his CO.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.670
All right,
what about his other life?

10:27.714 --> 10:29.193
Online, uh, when Rojas

10:29.237 --> 10:31.935
wasn't welding ships
halfway around the world,

10:31.979 --> 10:35.156
he was NAVYgamer-Z
on his livestreaming channel.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.679
McGEE:
It means he played

10:36.723 --> 10:38.333
video games for money online.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.117
Yeah, our petty officer
made more gaming

10:40.161 --> 10:42.119
than he did working
for Uncle Sam.What?

10:42.163 --> 10:43.381
How the hell does that work?

10:43.425 --> 10:45.949
Oh, believe me,
I've asked the same thing.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.299
Well, some of the money
comes from online ad revenue,

10:48.343 --> 10:49.605
like commercials.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.912
Some of it comes from
subscribers that donate.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.696
The point is our victim's
civilian life

10:53.740 --> 10:55.132
was spent entirely online.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.917
I mean, he rarely
left the house.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.745
Our body was dressed up
as a video game.

10:58.788 --> 10:59.746
So our killer

10:59.789 --> 11:01.356
could be a fellow gamer.

11:01.399 --> 11:02.662
Well, find out.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.447
Boss, his hard drive
was completely wiped clean.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.450
We'd have to subpoena records
from CyberVid Streaming.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.060
Well, do it.
If you need me, call.

11:10.104 --> 11:13.063
Wh... Are you leaving? Again?

11:22.072 --> 11:24.292
Why did the colonists throw tea
into the Boston Harbor

11:24.335 --> 11:25.685
instead of stealing it?

11:25.728 --> 11:28.078
Good question.
Look it up.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.650
They could have sold it
on the black market.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.609
Why not get King George's
attention andmake money?

11:37.653 --> 11:40.656
I meant look it up
in the textbook.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.747
That's not American history.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.227
I'm sorry.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.228
Everybody at school

11:47.271 --> 11:49.230
is talking about this video.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.885
And I love NAVYgamer's channel.

11:51.928 --> 11:55.497
And he plays KwK3,
which is my favorite game.

11:56.541 --> 11:57.717
Your mom said no screens.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.028
Please don't tell her.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.814
Promise me you
won't tell her.

12:07.857 --> 12:10.033
It's all my fault.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.949
No, no,
no, no, no.Slow down.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.472
What do you mean
it's your fault?

12:14.516 --> 12:16.474
The reason Mom had to leave.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.041
Right?

12:18.085 --> 12:19.651
It's because of me.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.828
That's why you two
were whispering.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.699
I'm the problem.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.442
Phineas.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.792
Hey.

12:29.836 --> 12:33.578
Your mom does not think
that you are a problem.

12:33.622 --> 12:36.451
Then why is she so scared?

12:36.494 --> 12:39.323
Is my dad gonna take me away?

12:48.332 --> 12:50.073
Good morning, Kasie.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.598
I have bullets and I have
glitter from the victim's body.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.776
Ugh, I will never look at
teddy bears the same way again.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.603
Those little suckers
are violent.

12:58.647 --> 12:59.953
Oh, Killing
with Kindness.

12:59.996 --> 13:00.954
You play?

13:00.997 --> 13:03.478
Uh, no. I watched.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.785
And what started
as a little case research

13:05.828 --> 13:08.918
quickly turned
into an all-night binge.

13:08.962 --> 13:12.313
I play my fair share
of video games, but...

13:12.356 --> 13:14.576
is watching them
really all that interesting?

13:14.619 --> 13:15.577
Hell no.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.579
At least, not at first.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.755
But then once I figured out
what was going on,

13:19.799 --> 13:23.063
I just... couldn't stop.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.542
You didn't sleep, did you?

13:24.586 --> 13:25.587
No.

13:25.630 --> 13:26.718
That makes two of us.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.111
I decided to

13:28.155 --> 13:30.810
dip my toe
into the waters of KwK3.

13:30.853 --> 13:34.596
What started as a little
case research turned into...

13:34.639 --> 13:35.597
All-night binge.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.338
Got it.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.600
I'm good, though.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.732
I'm a finely-tuned
gaming machine,

13:40.776 --> 13:41.646
so...

13:42.473 --> 13:43.823
Kasie, you got an update?

13:43.866 --> 13:46.651
Yes. Because my sleep
deprivation was not in vain.

13:46.695 --> 13:47.739
After sifting

13:47.783 --> 13:49.611
through hours
of our victim's

13:49.654 --> 13:52.788
past gaming videos,
I found his best friend.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.486
FloridaCOW82.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.488
Our murdered petty officer
and FloridaCOW

13:57.532 --> 14:00.361
chatted online and
played KwK3together

14:00.404 --> 14:02.929
all the time.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.366
You got an ID?No real name yet,
but FloridaCOW

14:05.409 --> 14:07.890
is livestreaming as we speak.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.414
Unfortunately,
no visual.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.025
This gamer
doesn't use a webcam.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.722
Oh, we can trace his IP address.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.506
Hey, easy there,
Donkey Kong.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.812
I already did that.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.379
Mm.FloridaCOW is
currently using

14:18.422 --> 14:20.860
a computer in Reston.Oh, Virginia.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.558
That's less than 40 minutes
from our crime scene.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.517
Which means the online BFF
could also be the killer.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.478
GIBBS:
Our suspect--

14:30.521 --> 14:32.523
where is he?Kasie traced
the IP address

14:32.567 --> 14:34.569
to a computer
in this building.

14:36.571 --> 14:39.443
Gated community
with a private clubhouse.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.271
You know, I'm not really sure
what I expected

14:41.315 --> 14:44.274
from a gamer
named FloridaCOW82.

14:44.318 --> 14:45.841
Well, not this.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.539
I mean, a juice bar,
a sports lounge

14:48.583 --> 14:50.541
and a pool with a lazy river.

14:50.585 --> 14:53.501
Video gamers make enough money
to live here?

14:53.544 --> 14:55.938
MAN:
It's a brave new world.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.548
And if you're
talking video games,

14:57.592 --> 14:59.333
you must be looking for Jesse.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.031
Uh, well, that depends.

15:02.075 --> 15:05.252
Does Jesse go
by the screen name FloridaCOW82?

15:05.295 --> 15:06.862
Oh, I'm retired.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.125
I do puzzles, not the Interwebs.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.998
But the computer room
is right through there.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.391
It was supposed to be
for business use,

15:14.435 --> 15:16.263
but Jesse turned it
into an arcade.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.787
He and his little friends
are in there now.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.615
Ha-ha!

15:20.658 --> 15:21.529
Suck my glitter!

15:21.572 --> 15:22.530
Look out!

15:22.573 --> 15:24.010
Behind you, bro!

15:24.053 --> 15:25.446
Frag that teddy bear, Jesse!

15:25.489 --> 15:26.490
Frag him!

15:27.491 --> 15:28.579
Yeah, that's it!

15:28.623 --> 15:29.798
You got to be
kidding me.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.060
Excuse us.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.627
You'll have to
wait your turn.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.541
FloridaCOW is on

15:33.584 --> 15:35.586
a massive kill spree.

15:35.630 --> 15:36.457
Damn right I am.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.460
Die, you plush suckers. Die.

15:39.503 --> 15:40.809
[whoops, laughs]

15:50.340 --> 15:53.300
Ian's death has me
in a pretty bad place.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.736
It's everywhere,
and it's...

15:54.779 --> 15:56.738
it's awful.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.349
You and Petty Officer Rojas

15:59.393 --> 16:01.438
were friends online, right?

16:01.482 --> 16:02.700
Where you play...

16:02.744 --> 16:04.441
video games.

16:04.485 --> 16:05.268
Tell you the truth,

16:05.312 --> 16:07.575
video games saved my life.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.751
When my wife passed last year,
I was a mess.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.145
Sad and lonely.

16:12.188 --> 16:15.148
And then I met Ian
in a military chat group online.

16:15.191 --> 16:16.932
Are you Navy, too?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.412
Retired 1982.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.805
Stood duty as chief of the watch
on the USS Florida.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.285
Explains the username.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.026
Florida C-O-W.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.593
Ian's idea.

16:25.636 --> 16:28.726
I hadn't played a video game
in my life until I met him.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.555
Ian showed me the ropes
and got me hooked.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.557
Gaming keeps me sharp
and social.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.472
Not to mention,
it's a total blast.

16:35.516 --> 16:36.996
You-you should
definitely try it.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.476
Have you two ever met

16:39.520 --> 16:40.303
in person?

16:40.347 --> 16:41.652
No.
I mean, uh,

16:41.696 --> 16:44.003
I know Ian lives in Maryland,

16:44.046 --> 16:47.484
but we never felt the need
to meet up in real life.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.530
Ian didn't have
much family.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.488
He called me his gaming grandpa.

16:51.532 --> 16:54.056
Records show the last time
you two gamed together

16:54.100 --> 16:55.666
was the night of his death.Yeah.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.451
We talked on the phone, too.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.582
What time was the call?

16:58.626 --> 17:00.802
A little after 7:00 p.m.

17:00.845 --> 17:03.065
You had a conversation
with the victim

17:03.109 --> 17:06.416
an hour before someone
went to his home and shot him?

17:06.460 --> 17:08.418
Yeah.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.594
[chuckles softly]
I didn't realize.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.728
But it's not like Idid it.
[chuckles]

17:13.771 --> 17:16.470
I mean,
our-our phone call was friendly.

17:16.513 --> 17:19.560
Can you prove that?

17:19.603 --> 17:23.085
Hey, Elmer, sorry to interrupt.
You got a minute?

17:23.129 --> 17:25.392
Well, make it fast.
I'm in the zone.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.350
Would you please tell these
NCIS agents

17:27.394 --> 17:28.873
where I was two nights ago?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.527
How would I know that?

17:30.571 --> 17:33.356
Because you witnessed a phone
call I had, right over there.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.315
You were doing your puzzles
around 7:00.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.925
I asked the person
on the other end

17:36.968 --> 17:40.189
to fix our clubhouse WiFi,
because it's been so glitchy.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.278
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:42.322 --> 17:45.194
My phone still has a wire
attached to the wall.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.457
But if this has
anything to do with

17:47.501 --> 17:49.546
clubhouse equipment,
it has to

17:49.590 --> 17:52.114
go through the HOA.
It's in the dues handbook.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.595
Yes. That's exactly what you
told me when I hung up.

17:54.638 --> 17:55.683
Remember now?

17:55.726 --> 17:57.467
Elmer, please.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.382
Yeah, I-I do remember.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.470
Thank you.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.299
See, the call was harmless.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.735
'Cause then you
ran out of here

18:04.779 --> 18:06.389
in a big old hurry.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.784
On second thought, don't
listen to Elmer. He's old.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.046
I heard that.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.395
I was hurrying home.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.484
I got lost in the game
and forgot to let my dog out.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.443
I swear, I didn't
kill my friend.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.662
Any idea who did?

18:19.707 --> 18:20.838
Well, now that you mention it,

18:20.882 --> 18:22.362
I-I might.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.930
How much do you know about mice?

18:25.974 --> 18:28.498
McGEE:
He meant computer mice.

18:28.542 --> 18:32.023
Specifically the Splendifida XRM
gaming mouse.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.200
Uses lasers for better response.

18:34.243 --> 18:37.507
Better response means better
game play across the board.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.118
All right, chill out, McGee.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.207
You don't have to prove your
video game street cred to us.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.079
Even though we just met
grandparents who are way more

18:44.123 --> 18:46.473
plugged-in than you are.McGEE: Hey...

18:46.516 --> 18:47.517
I'm not young enough
to have free time,

18:47.561 --> 18:49.040
and I'm not old enough
to retire.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.086
You're in video game purgatory.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.479
Yes, I know.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.263
Really hurts, huh?

18:54.307 --> 18:56.091
TORRES:
Hey, McGee.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.440
Use that hurt.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.095
Tell us how that
super-laser mouse

19:00.139 --> 19:01.531
can help us find
our killer.

19:01.575 --> 19:04.099
Server data came back
from the streaming service.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.581
I found private messages
sent to our petty officer.Well,

19:07.624 --> 19:09.539
it's all been redacted. How
are we supposed to read this?

19:09.583 --> 19:12.325
Well, I removed all the language
that wasn't safe for work.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.196
That's like the whole
damn thing.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.329
In summary, the sender
threatened to kill

19:16.372 --> 19:18.505
Petty Officer Rojas for ruining
his sponsorship deal.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.594
Sponsorship?

19:20.637 --> 19:22.248
Is that like Nike
and Lebron?

19:22.291 --> 19:26.034
Well, athletes advertise
shoes and-and sports drinks.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.862
Gamers get paid
to promote computer equipment.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.169
Such as laser mice.Exactly.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.258
Meet DirtybirdD220.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.521
Dirtybird's another
popular livestreamer

19:34.564 --> 19:37.219
who used to have a sponsorship
deal with Splendifida.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.786
Used to?
What happened?

19:38.829 --> 19:40.527
he got caught
harassing women online.

19:40.570 --> 19:43.617
Oh, a misogynist
on the Internet.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.575
Well, knock me over
with a feather.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.968
Our petty officer
reported it,

19:47.011 --> 19:50.711
and Dirtybird lost his deal,
along with $75,000,

19:50.754 --> 19:53.235
75,000 reasons
for murder.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.151
Now all we got to do
is ID Dirtybird.

20:01.678 --> 20:04.115
So... what do you think?

20:04.159 --> 20:06.422
Aw.
I think you won first place

20:06.466 --> 20:08.119
at the science fair.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.252
[chuckles]
Yeah. And?

20:10.296 --> 20:13.429
And I can't believe
you never told me about Phineas.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.865
Does the rest
of the team know?

20:15.910 --> 20:17.259
Jack, I called you.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.175
Right.
About his little breakdown.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.831
Listen, kids are perceptive.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.312
Phineas knows there's something
going on with his mom.

20:26.355 --> 20:29.228
Yeah, but she asked me
not to talk about it.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.621
Tell me.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.667
How do I help Phin?

20:33.710 --> 20:35.669
Help Phin do what?

20:35.712 --> 20:37.671
I don't know.
Feel better.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.238
You are.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.413
Well, whatever
I did last night

20:40.456 --> 20:42.066
didn't work.
All right?

20:42.110 --> 20:44.417
After he stopped crying,

20:44.460 --> 20:47.289
all we did is talk about
damn video games

20:47.333 --> 20:48.464
until he fell asleep.

20:48.508 --> 20:49.857
That's perfect.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.293
Oh, come on, Jack.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.816
You do not
need any help.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.689
You are already
doing everything right.

20:55.732 --> 20:58.344
Baseball, volcanoes,
even talking about video games.

20:58.387 --> 21:01.608
You are present and engaged.

21:01.651 --> 21:04.306
Just keep engaging.
That's all Phin really needs.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.917
And I think it's sweet

21:06.961 --> 21:08.571
that you're worried.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.660
You're a good man, Gibbs,

21:10.704 --> 21:12.706
and you're good for this kid.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.404
We're done here.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.058
And Phineas
is good for you, too.

21:18.015 --> 21:20.496
Change is good.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.150
Ooh, yeah. Boom!

21:22.193 --> 21:24.413
Go glitter all over
your dead-ass face.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.372
Think you're gonna get away,
huh? Oh, uh-huh.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.504
Hell, no. Boom! Head shot.

21:28.548 --> 21:31.028
Well, at least
DirtybirdD220's livestreaming.

21:31.072 --> 21:33.509
That the guy who threatened
our petty officer?Yeah.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.555
Over losing
75 grand.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.687
Sounds like motive to me.
Bring him in.

21:37.731 --> 21:39.733
Boss, we will
absolutely do that.

21:39.776 --> 21:42.126
Once we figure out who he is.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.345
And where he is.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.129
He's right there.

21:45.173 --> 21:48.437
Well, uh, technically, yes,
boss, but we need an actual

21:48.481 --> 21:50.004
physical location.
See, he's masked

21:50.047 --> 21:51.527
his IP address with a VPN,

21:51.571 --> 21:53.268
so we can't trace him
like we did before.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.270
We don't even
have a real name.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.228
Dirtybird is an anonymous
Internet troll.

21:57.272 --> 21:59.361
He's an expert
at hiding his true identity.

21:59.405 --> 22:00.580
But I can see him.

22:00.623 --> 22:03.017
We put out a BOLO
on his webcam image,

22:03.060 --> 22:04.714
but that's a long shot.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.194
Kasie, you got
to give me something.

22:06.237 --> 22:07.587
There is one way we might

22:07.630 --> 22:09.023
be able to locate this guy.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.807
Yeah. But?But...

22:10.851 --> 22:13.419
it's nearly impossible,
and it's profoundly geeky.

22:13.462 --> 22:15.159
Geeky-er.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.727
Let me hear it.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.903
We join Dirtybird's clan.

22:19.947 --> 22:23.516
The clan is a group of gamers
that plays together online.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.953
Point is if we can
convince Dirtybird

22:25.996 --> 22:27.868
to host us on his
private network,

22:27.911 --> 22:29.870
we might be able
to track his location.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.829
Yeah, join the bird thing.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.570
Well, that's not
the geeky part, boss.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.529
In order to get
a squad invitation,

22:36.572 --> 22:40.489
you have to be good.
Like, really, reallygood.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.622
Meaning we need
a KwK3gamer

22:42.665 --> 22:44.406
with a rating
of at least 250.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.843
Well, fine.
What's your score?

22:46.887 --> 22:49.498
Well, after, uh,
binging last night,

22:49.542 --> 22:50.717
I'm a...

22:50.760 --> 22:52.327
I'm a 14.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.460
So, uh, it might as well
be a dead end,

22:54.503 --> 22:56.331
unless we know someone
that's really good

22:56.375 --> 22:57.593
at shooting teddy bears.

23:00.553 --> 23:01.684
I may have a guy.

23:06.820 --> 23:10.040
So, what exactly did Gibbs mean
by he "has a guy"?

23:10.084 --> 23:12.695
I don't know.
I mean, I'm his guy.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.263
Unless he's got a new guy.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.438
But why would he do that?

23:16.482 --> 23:17.961
You had kids.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.181
You got sloppy.[scoffs]

23:20.224 --> 23:23.053
Hey, listen up.
This is Phineas.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.447
Phineas, this is McGee,
this is Bishop.

23:25.491 --> 23:26.883
Torres. Phineas.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.625
Uh, th-this is your guy?

23:30.496 --> 23:32.019
But he's, like, four.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.455
Dude, I'm nine.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.370
It's nice to meet you, Phineas.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.677
So, um, how do you guys
know each other?

23:37.720 --> 23:40.375
Jethro Gibbs lives
across the street from me.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.898
I slept over last night.

23:41.942 --> 23:44.597
Why?

23:44.640 --> 23:45.728
Were you being punished?

23:45.772 --> 23:47.426
Stick to the case.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.253
Oh, you mean the case
where we get to catch a bad guy

23:49.297 --> 23:50.254
using video games?

23:50.298 --> 23:51.342
Yeah, that's right.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.475
Well, boss, like I said,

23:53.519 --> 23:55.172
we're gonna need a gamer
with at least

23:55.216 --> 23:58.349
a rating of 250 in order to get
our suspect's attention.

23:58.393 --> 24:01.962
Yeah, well, Phineas'
rating is 322.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.006
That good enough, McGee?

24:05.182 --> 24:08.055
Wow. Okay.
Phineas, here.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.448
Come with me.
We got a...

24:09.491 --> 24:11.362
we got a new computer
here from Cyber.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.626
It's got an upgraded GPU, CPU.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.542
And I've installed
the latest map expansion pack.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.240
Cool.
How's the Internet speed?

24:19.283 --> 24:20.546
Is it fast?

24:20.589 --> 24:21.851
Well, it's a-it's a
government building,

24:21.895 --> 24:24.941
so, uh, speeds
may, uh, may vary.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.421
Eh, that's putting it nicely.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.205
The Internet here sucks, kid.

24:28.249 --> 24:29.990
Glitches are bad for gamers.

24:30.033 --> 24:32.514
We need a connection
with zero lag.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.429
You heard him, McGee.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.822
Zero lag.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.780
Well, boss, to do that
we're gonna need

24:37.824 --> 24:40.435
a private data tunnel
with a dedicated server.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.568
BISHOP:
Well, and there's only one room

24:42.611 --> 24:44.483
at NCIS with those
specs, so...

24:49.488 --> 24:51.664
[whoops]

24:56.930 --> 24:59.802
Oh, yeah, this is sick!

25:08.637 --> 25:10.073
TEDDY BEAR: Uh-oh![gunfire on monitor]

25:10.117 --> 25:11.858
Nice.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.034
[exclaiming]

25:15.601 --> 25:17.385
Right there.

25:20.344 --> 25:21.476
Huh.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.523
Video games in MTAC?

25:24.566 --> 25:26.307
Wasn't exactly what I meant

25:26.350 --> 25:29.092
when I said keep
engaging Phineas.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.790
Does his mother
know about this?

25:30.833 --> 25:32.661
I left a message.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.490
She said no screens,
so you gave him

25:35.534 --> 25:37.536
the biggest screen
in the building?

25:37.579 --> 25:40.016
It's about the case, Jack.

25:40.060 --> 25:43.585
Where a man was killed
live on the Internet.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.631
GIBBS:
He's playing video games, Jack,

25:45.674 --> 25:47.371
with teddy bears.

25:47.415 --> 25:48.938
I'm just saying.

25:48.982 --> 25:52.420
Okay, operation "Catch the
Dirtybird" is in full effect.

25:52.463 --> 25:55.858
We sent a request to join the
murder suspect's gaming clan.

25:55.902 --> 25:58.339
All we got to do now is wait for
him to notice how good we are.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.601
We?

25:59.645 --> 26:02.822
Well, Phineas.
And, boy, is he good, boss.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.954
I have-I have never seen
so many dead teddy bears

26:04.998 --> 26:06.390
in all my life.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.089
Does his mother know about this?

26:10.438 --> 26:13.136
Just make it work, Tim.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.051
On it, boss.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.709
What?

26:20.753 --> 26:22.972
There you are.

26:23.016 --> 26:26.628
Why'd you call me out here?
It's... outside.

26:28.412 --> 26:31.024
Okay.
Whatcha doing?

26:31.067 --> 26:33.504
Just soaking up the vitamin D.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.028
You know,
appreciating the outdoors.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.595
BISHOP:
Mm-hmm.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.728
Found a leaf.

26:39.772 --> 26:40.816
Nature's full of wonder.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.427
Had enough video games, huh?

26:43.471 --> 26:45.386
Eh, we're just tired
of the screens.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.606
Yeah, we want
something real.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.738
Shh.
Is that a bird?

26:49.782 --> 26:52.611
Well, I guess I can give you
my case update

26:52.654 --> 26:54.047
right here.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.657
Ooh, would you do that?

26:55.701 --> 26:57.050
I processed the glitter
from our dead body.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.486
Dead end.

26:58.529 --> 27:01.184
Turned out it belonged
to our petty officer.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.795
Glitter came from
a video game T-shirt

27:02.838 --> 27:03.796
promotional giveaway.

27:03.839 --> 27:04.971
What about the bullets?

27:05.014 --> 27:06.407
Much more helpful.

27:06.450 --> 27:09.062
I found heavy oxidation
in the bullet striations.

27:09.105 --> 27:10.541
Rust?

27:10.585 --> 27:12.631
Meaning the murder weapon is

27:12.674 --> 27:14.676
a .45-caliber pistol
that had not been fired

27:14.720 --> 27:17.113
in a dangerously long time.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.854
And I really want to
show you pictures

27:18.898 --> 27:20.508
of .45-caliber weapons
on my screen,

27:20.551 --> 27:22.771
but I am fighting the urge.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.643
Mm, God bless you, Kasie.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.732
Suffice it to say
if you can find the gun,

27:26.775 --> 27:27.907
I can match it.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.606
We have to find
the killer first.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.783
Yeah. Let's just hope this video
game thing actually works.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.439
[exclaiming]

27:38.482 --> 27:41.007
It's taking too long.
It's not working.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.573
McGee, is this working?

27:42.617 --> 27:44.706
Absolutely, boss.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.403
We're on it.

27:46.447 --> 27:47.753
[quietly]:
Don't lie to Jethro Gibbs.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.145
You'll get in trouble.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.017
Kid, you're preaching
to the choir, okay?

27:51.060 --> 27:53.976
But if this plan doesn't work,
I'm in even bigger trouble.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.631
So change the plan,
Agent McGee.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.373
Instead of waiting
for Dirtybird to reply to us,

27:59.416 --> 28:00.722
we go after him.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.550
What do you mean by "go after"?

28:02.593 --> 28:03.725
Trash talk.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.640
Exactly, Jethro Gibbs.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.645
Wait, wh-what are we doing?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.081
Taunting him.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.779
He's a bully, right?

28:13.822 --> 28:15.476
Well, yeah, but...

28:15.519 --> 28:17.217
You ever get pushed
into a locker?

28:17.260 --> 28:19.654
You kidding?
I was a tap dancer.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.787
Then you know
you got to push back.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.571
Jethro Gibbs taught me that.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.532
Oh, wow, he's already
messaging us back.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.665
Yup.
And he's challenging me

28:30.709 --> 28:32.232
to a one-on-one
death match.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.363
What's that mean?

28:33.407 --> 28:34.538
Means it's working, boss.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.323
So what do I do?

28:36.366 --> 28:39.239
Do I accept?Yes, yes, hit "accept".

28:39.282 --> 28:41.632
You join his network,
I can track his location.

28:43.547 --> 28:45.375
All right, now, this may
take some time, Phineas.

28:45.419 --> 28:46.725
I need you to try
and stay alive

28:46.768 --> 28:48.770
for as long as
you possibly can, okay?

28:48.814 --> 28:50.729
On it, boss.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.167
[phone rings]

28:54.210 --> 28:55.472
If that's my mom,

28:55.516 --> 28:57.605
tell her I want to stay longer.

29:08.703 --> 29:09.791
So this is where

29:09.835 --> 29:11.750
our Dirtybird lives?Mm-hmm.

29:11.793 --> 29:14.143
He's online
in the second-floor loft

29:14.187 --> 29:16.624
rented to
Dustin Vanderschmitt.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.234
Time to bust some heads.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.367
We're not busting heads, we're
bringing him in for questioning.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.586
Have you seen what this creep
says about women?

29:22.630 --> 29:25.154
Okay, maybe we'll bust heads
a little bit.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.374
That's what I'm talking about.

29:27.417 --> 29:28.592
Oh, hold up.

29:28.636 --> 29:31.247
Here's our Dirtybird now.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.727
Thank you,
Phineas.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.950
Sorry about the
broken call box.

29:37.993 --> 29:39.386
You know I would have
buzzed you up.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.431
Please sign the receipt, sir.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.390
You can still come
upstairs if you want.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.827
You know, I accidentally
left your tip in my apartment.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.611
Thanks, I'll wait here.

29:47.655 --> 29:48.830
That's a smart move.
I wouldn't go anywhere

29:48.874 --> 29:49.657
with this guy.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.267
Whoa, bitch.

29:51.311 --> 29:52.573
Who the hell are you?

29:52.616 --> 29:55.794
Your worst nightmare.
A woman with authority.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.015
Oh, this day
keeps getting better.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.675
Hey.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.677
Where are you going?

30:09.720 --> 30:11.592
Hopefully upstairs
to get my tip.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.689
Don't do it, man. This ain't
one of your video games.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.388
Screw you.
[grunting]

30:29.958 --> 30:31.612
Aah!

30:32.613 --> 30:33.396
[grunting]

30:34.615 --> 30:36.573
Oh, no. Oh...

30:36.617 --> 30:38.358
Aah!

30:38.401 --> 30:40.795
I don't think you're gonna
be getting that tip.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.407
Oh, forget it, that was
worth every penny right there.[groaning]

30:49.412 --> 30:51.197
TORRES:
Dustin Vanderschmitt.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.808
You are a hard troll to find.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.158
I didn't do anything wrong.

30:56.202 --> 30:59.074
Then why run, Super Mario?

30:59.118 --> 31:02.164
[scoffs] Hey, I-I had
nothing to do with that.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.644
I'm not a violent person.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.995
"All these feminists online,

31:07.039 --> 31:09.258
shut up and go have my baby."

31:09.302 --> 31:10.520
[laughs]

31:10.564 --> 31:12.522
"Rape occurs in many species.

31:12.566 --> 31:14.524
It's natural."

31:14.568 --> 31:16.048
No, that's just science.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.919
And none of this is illegal.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.399
Free speech.

31:19.442 --> 31:22.576
"You cost me $75,000.
I'm gonna blank you up."

31:23.838 --> 31:26.188
Death threats are illegal.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.931
Especially when you
follow through.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.498
No, no, I...
[scoffs]

31:31.541 --> 31:34.501
The murder happened
two nights ago, right?

31:34.544 --> 31:36.068
I was busy.

31:36.111 --> 31:39.549
So what does a sexist troll do
on a Wednesday night, huh?

31:39.593 --> 31:41.725
Typical female overreaction.

31:41.769 --> 31:43.945
See, th-this
is why I ran.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.078
And why I don't want
to tell you where I was.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.993
You're just gonna spread
these lies about me

31:48.036 --> 31:49.342
to the other parents.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.083
Other parents?

31:51.126 --> 31:52.475
You have a child?

31:52.519 --> 31:55.217
Yes. She lives with my ex.

31:55.261 --> 31:58.699
But I don't want to bring my
little girl into all of this.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.831
You rather
she visit you in prison?

32:02.659 --> 32:04.661
[sighs]

32:04.705 --> 32:06.968
Fine.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.623
I coach her basketball team
at the community center.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.930
I was at practice
two nights ago.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.498
You coach little girls.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.413
This is a whole lot
of messed up.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.501
Oh, whatever.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.721
My lady Tigers are undefeated.

32:20.764 --> 32:23.245
I can prove it.

32:23.289 --> 32:24.943
Hey.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.728
[interrogation continuing
indistinctly]

32:27.771 --> 32:29.904
How's it going in there?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.646
Oh, that bad, huh?

32:32.689 --> 32:34.430
Do you need something, Jack?

32:34.474 --> 32:37.129
Uh, Sarah came
to pick up Phineas.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.174
I have them
in the squad room.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.090
PHINEAS:
Then Agent McGee

32:42.134 --> 32:44.440
showed me the cyber basement
and that was awesome.

32:44.484 --> 32:47.008
And then I got to put
on a bulletproof vest

32:47.052 --> 32:48.618
and that was awesome.

32:48.662 --> 32:51.752
They're even going to get me
an official NCIS badge.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.536
That's awesome, right, Mom?

32:53.580 --> 32:55.582
So awesome, love.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.586
Agent Gibbs.

32:59.629 --> 33:02.197
Sounds like you two
had quite a day.

33:04.156 --> 33:07.115
Jack, maybe you could take, uh,
Phineas by the break room,

33:07.159 --> 33:09.030
grab a snack
for the ride home?

33:09.074 --> 33:12.033
Good idea. Yeah.
Nothing sugary, please.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.034
Sure.
No problem.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.383
Come on.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.736
What the hell were you thinking?

33:19.780 --> 33:22.565
You took Phineas out of his
after-school enrichment class

33:22.609 --> 33:24.480
to play video games?

33:24.524 --> 33:25.829
Wasn't about games.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.831
Phineas has real talent.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.659
He caught a murder suspect.

33:29.703 --> 33:32.401
I said no screens.

33:32.445 --> 33:35.056
I didn't realize I had to say
no murder investigations.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.971
I made a judgment call.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.799
He is a really smart kid.

33:38.842 --> 33:41.280
Don't tell me about my son.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.630
Agent Gibbs,
this was

33:43.673 --> 33:46.459
clearly a mistake,
and one that won't happen again.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.506
I think it's best if Phineas
doesn't see you anymore.

34:05.956 --> 34:08.655
BISHOP:
Well, our Dirtybird
was telling the truth.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.135
He's not our killer.Oh.

34:10.178 --> 34:12.572
So he's just
a Internet creep

34:12.615 --> 34:13.703
who coaches little girls.

34:13.747 --> 34:14.878
Well, he's about
to lose that job.

34:14.922 --> 34:16.663
Wait, you told
the other parents

34:16.706 --> 34:19.666
about him being
a woman-hating scumbag?

34:19.709 --> 34:20.667
It's not a lie.

34:20.710 --> 34:21.972
Nice.Mm-hmm.

34:22.016 --> 34:23.278
It's a small victory,

34:23.322 --> 34:24.714
because we're back
to square one.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.368
Well, hopefully not for long.

34:26.412 --> 34:27.891
Hey, McGee,
where have you been?

34:27.935 --> 34:30.068
Trying to save my job.Okay.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.679
For the last time, Gibbs
is not replacing you.

34:32.722 --> 34:34.985
It's not about that anymore.

34:35.029 --> 34:38.119
I think my video game plan
may have cost Gibbs his new BFF.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.338
Phineas?

34:39.381 --> 34:40.600
Yeah.
His mother got upset

34:40.643 --> 34:42.776
and won't let him hang out
with Gibbs anymore.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.778
Aw, that's kinda sad.

34:44.821 --> 34:47.998
Which is why I'm reexamining
this case from top to bottom.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.304
And you solved it.

34:49.348 --> 34:50.697
Well, no.

34:50.740 --> 34:51.959
But I found something
pretty unusual.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.743
Well, you got something,
let's hear it. Go.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.923
TORRES:
Mm. That fancy gated community.

34:59.967 --> 35:02.317
Yeah, where we met
Grandpa Gamer.

35:02.361 --> 35:03.797
Yeah, I re-checked
his alibi.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.408
He said he called our victim
about a glitchy Internet.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.106
Was he lying?McGEE: No.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.108
No, I hacked into
the community network

35:10.151 --> 35:11.631
and it is very glitchy.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.415
Reason being
all the malicious

35:13.459 --> 35:15.113
code and spyware.

35:15.156 --> 35:18.290
There's been 19 identity thefts
in this neighborhood alone.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.682
Who are we looking for?

35:19.726 --> 35:21.423
Well, that's
the problem, boss.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.990
I have no idea.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.253
I have no idea if this
even connects to our murder.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.602
Rule 39.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.430
No such thing
as coincidence.

35:28.474 --> 35:29.649
I agree.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.216
But right now,
that's the only lead I've got.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.131
Why is it disappearing?

35:33.957 --> 35:35.611
Well, I'm not doing that.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.918
Someone else must be logged
into the network.

35:37.961 --> 35:39.833
And they're deleting code.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.748
Deleting evidence.

35:41.791 --> 35:44.620
Uh, boss, whoever it is,
they're not using a VPN.

35:44.664 --> 35:45.621
I can track 'em.

35:45.665 --> 35:46.840
Do it, Elf Lord.

35:58.721 --> 35:59.766
Federal agents!

36:01.550 --> 36:03.117
Put your hands up.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.341
Elmer?

36:10.820 --> 36:12.866
Not the grandpa
we were expecting.

36:12.909 --> 36:15.738
Wh... Where am I?

36:15.782 --> 36:16.957
Get your hands up.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.050
Hey. I already said,

36:23.093 --> 36:24.965
I'm on this whole cocktail
of heart meds.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.880
Uh, they make me loopy.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.535
I must've wandered into
the computer room by accident.

36:29.578 --> 36:31.928
Logging into the network
and deleting evidence--

36:31.972 --> 36:33.756
was that an accident, too?

36:33.800 --> 36:36.803
That razzle-dazzle tech crapola
is for kids.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.326
I don't do the Interwebs.

36:38.370 --> 36:39.806
Just puzzles.
Right?

36:39.849 --> 36:40.807
I'm old.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.591
I'm retired.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.593
Convincing story.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.856
Except you retired

36:46.900 --> 36:49.163
from SwiftCast Communications,
where you were

36:49.207 --> 36:50.773
senior vice president

36:50.817 --> 36:52.384
of network
technologies.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.690
That's why you can afford
to live in a gated community.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.997
Except you can't
afford it anymore.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.217
'Cause you are broke.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.914
Stock market's

37:00.957 --> 37:02.263
pretty fickle.
Plus,

37:02.307 --> 37:03.786
those HOA dues'll get you.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.224
Well, what's this
even prove, huh?

37:06.267 --> 37:08.965
Proves you're a murderer.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.665
N-Now wait.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.710
I thought we were talking
about computers and networks.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.712
Now, how does that
connect me to a murder?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.714
We caught you deleting bad code.

37:18.758 --> 37:19.933
Your code.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.500
Code that was
put there

37:21.543 --> 37:23.893
to steal private information
from residents.

37:23.937 --> 37:26.069
Well, even if that were true,

37:26.113 --> 37:28.289
that's hacking.
That's not murder.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.336
Until Grandpa Jesse started
complaining about glitches.

37:31.379 --> 37:34.295
And glitches are bad news
for gamers.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.950
Yes, they are.

37:36.993 --> 37:39.996
So Jesse called in his Navy
buddy to start looking into it.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.998
You witnessed
that phone call.

37:42.042 --> 37:43.304
Petty Officer
Rojas

37:43.348 --> 37:45.088
was digging into the network.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.003
Chances are he already
found your code.

37:47.047 --> 37:48.831
You looked him up,

37:48.875 --> 37:51.791
found his apartment,
shot him.

37:53.749 --> 37:57.013
Agent Gibbs, do you even know
what any of this means?

37:57.057 --> 37:58.624
Node ID?

37:58.667 --> 38:00.452
DNS? DHCP?

38:02.889 --> 38:04.369
No, I didn't think so.

38:04.412 --> 38:07.154
So how are you gonna
get a prosecutor or a jury

38:07.197 --> 38:10.418
to understand
this technobabble theory?[phone dings]

38:15.293 --> 38:17.295
We don't need to.

38:18.644 --> 38:19.862
While we've been talking,

38:19.906 --> 38:21.124
our forensic scientist

38:21.168 --> 38:23.126
has been processing
the .45-caliber handgun

38:23.170 --> 38:24.954
that we found
hidden in your garage.

38:24.998 --> 38:25.825
[door opens]

38:26.869 --> 38:28.306
Ballistics came back.

38:29.742 --> 38:31.744
This is the murder weapon.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.923
I'm sure a jury
can understand that.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.794
Game over.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.107
[blasting on TV]

38:47.150 --> 38:48.891
[exclaiming]

38:50.284 --> 38:52.068
So much for Vitamin D, huh?

38:52.112 --> 38:53.548
Ah, they make
lamps for that.

38:53.592 --> 38:54.680
Huh.

38:54.723 --> 38:56.812
If my brothers
could see me now.

38:56.856 --> 38:58.510
Ha-ha!

38:58.553 --> 39:00.207
Ha.
Suck my glitter.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.644
Whoa, potty mouth.

39:02.688 --> 39:04.211
I got more snacks.

39:04.254 --> 39:05.255
My turn now.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.256
Mm-mmm.

39:06.300 --> 39:07.736
Not yet, leaf boy.

39:10.826 --> 39:14.352
Mama's about to mow down
the Teddy Bear King...

39:15.440 --> 39:17.703
...and save the princess.

39:18.965 --> 39:20.793
Ha!

39:22.577 --> 39:24.405
Yes.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.841
Ooh.

39:33.675 --> 39:34.676
[knocking]

39:34.720 --> 39:36.156
It's open.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.599
Agent Gibbs.

39:44.643 --> 39:46.427
Everything's here.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.736
Thanks.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.781
Okay.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.612
Listen, I-I should probably
explain about yesterday.

39:57.656 --> 40:00.398
No, there's no need.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.356
You set the rules.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.705
I broke 'em.

40:03.749 --> 40:05.838
Yes, you did.

40:05.881 --> 40:08.406
In pretty spectacular fashion.

40:08.449 --> 40:12.235
So spectacular that Phin
can't stop talking about it.

40:12.279 --> 40:13.933
Apparently, you gave him

40:13.976 --> 40:16.414
the "most totally awesome-est,

40:16.457 --> 40:17.980
best day ever."

40:18.024 --> 40:21.070
Phineas had
such a great day

40:21.114 --> 40:22.985
that we had

40:23.029 --> 40:24.987
a really good talk.

40:25.031 --> 40:28.469
He opened up about...
everything.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.166
Like you said, he's...

40:30.210 --> 40:32.386
a smart kid.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.692
Yeah, he's a smart kid.

40:35.345 --> 40:36.869
Loves Mom.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.827
And I don't want to lose him.

40:41.482 --> 40:42.483
Hey.

40:42.527 --> 40:43.484
You all right?

40:43.528 --> 40:46.313
Honestly, I don't know.

40:46.356 --> 40:50.012
Turns out my ex is
going to fight the ruling.

40:50.056 --> 40:53.581
More lawyers and money
than I'll ever have.

40:53.625 --> 40:55.844
So...

40:55.888 --> 40:57.846
maybe you could keep

40:57.890 --> 41:00.066
Phin's overnight bag.
You know...

41:00.109 --> 41:03.025
you know, for next time?

41:03.069 --> 41:05.419
Well, I mean,
you know,

41:05.463 --> 41:07.290
until I find a sitter, and...

41:07.334 --> 41:09.597
If you're still willing.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.475
I may not have seen it
at first, but...

41:18.563 --> 41:20.521
...you're good for Phin.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.784
Well...

41:22.828 --> 41:24.569
that works both ways.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.137
Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.052
Jethro.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.837
Call me Jethro.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.274
Okay.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.319
Thank you, Jethro.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.548

41:48.723 --> 41:50.725
