     Harold, I thought that
      you were an autumn,

01:49.110 --> 01:52.144
 and it turns out that you are
    a spring, just like me.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.750
      You look good. See?
 Oh, geez, Mom. You scared me.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.319
    I'm not the one talking
         to a dead guy.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.653
       -What do you want?
           -Upstairs!

02:01.655 --> 02:02.855
       I'm in the middle
    of something right now.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.531
        Happy birthday!

02:12.533 --> 02:14.266
    No, I'm not celebrating.

     to stay in even then.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.675
     Okay. Make your wish.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.777
  Wait. Did you even make one?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.513
      I couldn't think of
    anything, you make one.

02:27.515 --> 02:28.680

02:28.682 --> 02:30.883

Come on, I'm not that desperate.

       wanted to practice

    to teach Sam with that?

-He's way better than a banana.

   Well obviously, I ordered
    the wrong kind of doll.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.218
     But isn't he gorgeous?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.786

    kind of looks like dad.

             -How?
      -His eyes, no hair.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.192

     we've named him Pedro.

       buy some cheese."

             -Sam--

03:47.895 --> 03:48.827
    That your cheese smells
          like feet--

         off the days--
         -Put it away.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.837
    -So that whenever we get
       close to the day--
       -Put it away now.

 -Whatever you did, cancel it.

      hopes up like this?
      -Don't yell at her.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.746
             -Sam--
   -[Sam] I had as much to do
      with this as she did

04:07.982 --> 04:10.315
      Did you really think
    that this was something
       that was for real?

04:10.384 --> 04:12.484
      You didn't think we
       would actually go?

    don't even care anymore.
       -Oh come on, Sam.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.467
 since she learned how to talk.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.635
    Yes, but that's because
           of Peter.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.036
  And Mom, of all the places,

04:31.038 --> 04:32.437

   going on there right now?

    It's kind of a disaster.

 The whole world is a disaster.

       way to live in it.

         -Good for you.

           -And Sam?
     -Did you have any idea
        that there were

   a switch, don't you think

 clippers for me before you go?

     next to the geraniums.

than you are to win the lottery.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.508
   Well, the parlor entrance
    is just around the side.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.010
  Tried that, no one answered.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.646
  Well that's because I think
     you're a little early.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.817
      -Is that a problem?
      -You know, my mother
  usually handles this stuff,

07:31.819 --> 07:33.485
      and she's not here.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.619
   I'm sorry, you know what?

07:34.621 --> 07:35.821
    No, it's not a problem.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.824
Just, if you go around the side,

07:38.826 --> 07:39.758
   I'll make sure it's open.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.163
    Oh, wait, before you go,

07:45.165 --> 07:47.999
      could you grab those
     hedge clippers for me?

07:50.504 --> 07:51.236
             Sure.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.849
           Thank you.

      [lighthearted music]

08:22.035 --> 08:22.968
          Don't start.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.237
 -Why is the door still locked?
          -He's early.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.639
          -Unlock it.
        -I already did.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.641
     -Okay, go get dressed.
             -What?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.076
        Here, take this.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.756
      That was Frank, and
       he'll be handling
     your father's service.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.592
   I really wanted to see him

08:47.594 --> 08:48.827
    before you did all that.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.096
              Oh.

08:51.098 --> 08:55.800
 You know, you think you would,
         but trust me,
     it is better this way.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.137
    What color is his face?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.306
    Beige bisque number 40.

09:01.308 --> 09:06.211
      I wanted to see him,
not some made up version of him.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.246
       I can change it if
       you'd like me to.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.916
            No, no.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.921
     I'm sorry, it's fine.

09:18.025 --> 09:18.957
             Fine.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.292
   Well, you'd be the first.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.628
       We aren't built to
       be fine with this.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.135
I'd also like to read a passage.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.739
   When everybody gets here,
  from "A Calendar of Wisdom".

09:37.744 --> 09:38.677

             Yeah.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.616
   -Is that going to be here?
              -No.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.685
         -What is that?
        -A training aid.

09:54.828 --> 09:55.760
             Um...

09:59.232 --> 10:01.132
  I just had too much coffee.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.740
         What's wrong?

10:14.247 --> 10:15.180
         Are you okay?

10:16.316 --> 10:17.282
          No, I'm not.

10:30.631 --> 10:31.363
       Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.935
      I'm going to let you
    have some time with him.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.672
      Your father, not the
        doll, obviously.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.040
  That would be really weird.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.909
    I will be down the hall,

10:45.012 --> 10:47.212
  and Frank should be in soon.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.347
 -Wait, wait. What's your name?
            -Molly.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.316
             Molly.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.237
           Aw, shit.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.874
     Oh, shit, shit, shit.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.811
What are you doing to his face?

11:19.813 --> 11:20.912
        It's all wrong!

11:20.914 --> 11:22.147
         It's not him.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.350
 Of course it's not him, right?

11:26.319 --> 11:29.354
       It's some place he
       used to hang out.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.689
     An abandoned building.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.024
     How did you know him?

11:33.160 --> 11:35.994
    Oh, um, I don't, didn't.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.830
       I just live here,

11:38.832 --> 11:40.699
      and I'm not supposed
        to be down here

11:40.701 --> 11:42.167
   when there are people, so.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.768
Could I have his tie clip back?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.072
             What?

11:47.908 --> 11:48.840
     The one on your head.

11:50.143 --> 11:54.112
Oh, it's a barrette, it's mine.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.115
       I made it for him,
        in Eagle Scouts.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.383
  It's got my initials on it.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.890
     J.F. Joe Frederickson.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.193
         I must, um...

12:08.929 --> 12:10.795
[nervous laugh] I don't know how
    that got here, it just--

12:10.864 --> 12:13.465
       Probably happened
       when you took it.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.303
     Are you going to tell?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.206
        -I wasn't there.
            -Where?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.340
           When he...

12:25.879 --> 12:28.012
      Working. Working...

12:29.149 --> 12:30.181
      Out of the country.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.017
             Whoa!

12:33.787 --> 12:36.154
 Did he... Did he just breathe?

12:37.491 --> 12:41.226
            Oh, no.
       It just looks like
        that sometimes.

12:41.762 --> 12:42.494
    He didn't, don't worry.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.397
             So...

12:48.869 --> 12:49.868
Why were you out of the country?

12:52.839 --> 12:53.805
     I make documentaries.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.544
Oh my God, I'm like so addicted
   to the Discovery Channel.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.346
       -Would I have seen
       anything of yours?
           -Possibly.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.019
     You know, it's so cool
    that you get to travel.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.555
    I was supposed to go to
     Moscow in a few weeks

13:10.557 --> 13:12.223
     and I got a passport,

13:12.225 --> 13:14.459
  and I was learning Russian,
          and then...

13:17.197 --> 13:18.997
   You know what, I'm sorry.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.199
 I should just leave you alone.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.971
      It was nice to meet
        you, by the way.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.407
 And I'm sorry about your dad.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.244
       Um, is this weird?

13:34.447 --> 13:35.380
          Not really.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.482

13:40.120 --> 13:41.085
      About what I did...

13:41.087 --> 13:43.021
    I don't know what you're
         talking about.

13:55.869 --> 13:56.601

  picture to work from but...

14:30.036 --> 14:31.069
       And it's expired.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.171
     Still talking to them?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.441
 You know that's creepy, right?

     Molly. Do you hear me?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.723
  You have to take this trip.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.493

     up, it's movie night.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.228
    You hear that? Let's go.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.697
     [grandma] So what are
      we watching tonight?

16:41.301 --> 16:42.567
     You know that guy that
        was here today?

16:42.769 --> 16:45.236
   The kind of hot one, Joe.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.372
        -What about him?
    -He makes documentaries,

16:47.374 --> 16:48.773
   and I found one on demand.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.541
     It's about cruelty to
      animals in circuses

16:50.543 --> 16:52.377
      and animal shows all
        over the world.

16:52.746 --> 16:55.213

    the Moscow Cat Theater.

       which is so cool.
   -When did you talk to him?

17:00.020 --> 17:01.652
           -Earlier.
  -And you thought he was hot?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.721
     I don't know, kind of
    like someone's dad hot.

22:05.591 --> 22:06.991
      Mama, Mom, you okay?

22:06.993 --> 22:07.992
              Oh.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.660
         Oh, I'm fine.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.462
        [doorbell rings]

22:11.464 --> 22:12.396
    Sam, will you get that?

22:15.401 --> 22:17.802
       Mom, I'm going to
        call Dr. Barlow.

22:17.804 --> 22:18.969
            Oh, no.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.838
 I just forgot to eat breakfast

22:20.840 --> 22:22.840
       so I took my blood
         pressure pills

22:22.842 --> 22:23.874
      on an empty stomach.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.543
           I'm fine.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.082
   I'm sorry, this is crazy.

22:31.084 --> 22:33.417
  So crazy to bring him here.

22:33.419 --> 22:34.552
              Mom?

22:35.588 --> 22:37.021
      Joe. What happened?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.122
           It's Tuck.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.124
 He was just lying there cold.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.026
    And I was going to bury
      him in the backyard,

22:42.028 --> 22:44.462
        but I thought my
       condo association
      would frown on that.

22:45.064 --> 22:48.399
      Oh, I don't do pets.
       I don't even know
       if that's allowed.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.134
      Honey, you just cut
    open a plus-sized woman

22:50.136 --> 22:52.002
 with a pair of garden shears.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.938
    You're not going to help
  this poor man with his dog?

22:53.940 --> 22:54.939
      And I couldn't just
       dump him somewhere

22:54.941 --> 22:56.006
    because he was a rescue,

22:56.008 --> 22:57.475
 and he has abandonment issues.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.509
  Honey, we have to get going,

22:58.511 --> 22:59.443
  you're going to be so late!

22:59.579 --> 23:01.445
        Joe can take me.

23:01.447 --> 23:02.780
          -Right, Joe?
              -No.

23:04.417 --> 23:05.383
  Well, why don't you take me?

23:06.652 --> 23:08.452
 -How many points do you have?
            -Points?

23:08.454 --> 23:10.454
   -[Molly] On your license.
             -None.

23:10.456 --> 23:11.589
      How do you do that?

23:11.591 --> 23:12.723
          -I've got--
       -You have so many.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.759
    -I'm a very good driver.
 -I'm going to be so, so late.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.495
      Okay, I'll take him.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.065
    And I'll do what I can,
    but I can't embalm him.

23:21.134 --> 23:23.401
   No, no, that's not what I,
        I didn't mean...

23:27.840 --> 23:29.840
     I didn't have anywhere
          else to go.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.011
        He's my family.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.014
             Okay.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.884
     It's okay. I got him.

23:40.686 --> 23:41.619
           Thank you.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.020
           -Bye, Sam.
             -Bye.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.057
   -[grandma] Honey, I'll see
   you later at the recital.
             -Okay.

23:55.501 --> 23:56.434
          [door shuts]

23:57.136 --> 23:58.602
  I brought you some company.

23:59.005 --> 23:59.937
           Oh, great.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.843
     What do you think he's
     going to do with him?
You think he's going to keep him

24:05.845 --> 24:07.478
      like Roy Rogers did
         with Trigger?

24:07.480 --> 24:08.512
       I don't know, Mom,

24:08.514 --> 24:09.780
     I'm not a taxidermist.

24:10.716 --> 24:13.517
Your mother must think I'm nuts.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.055
      Well, glass houses.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.524
       What do you mean?

24:20.993 --> 24:21.926
          [chuckling]

24:23.196 --> 24:24.128
            Nothing.

24:26.933 --> 24:27.865
            Do you?

24:29.602 --> 24:31.035
        Think I'm nuts?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.239
        I've seen worse.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.575
   I don't want you driving.

24:37.743 --> 24:39.577
 I am not missing that recital.

24:39.946 --> 24:43.214
             Okay.
     Doctor first, and then
     Frank will drive you,

24:43.216 --> 24:44.882
        -you promise me?
              -No.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.518
     Stop treating me like
         an old person.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.153
     I've got at least ten
      good years before...

24:49.822 --> 24:51.922
       -70 is the new 60.
            -Mom...

24:52.892 --> 24:53.824
         Come with me.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.593
       You know I can't!

24:55.595 --> 24:56.927
     You don't have to come
         to the office,

24:56.996 --> 24:59.063
   -you can stay in the car.
     -Frank will drive you.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.999
     You told Sam that you
     would go on this trip.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.634
    How do you think you're
        going to make it

25:03.636 --> 25:06.070
if you can't even go four miles
    to the doctor's office.

25:07.573 --> 25:08.572
          Molly, I...

25:12.044 --> 25:12.977
          I need you.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.546
      Not Frank this time.

25:17.884 --> 25:18.816
              You.

25:19.719 --> 25:20.651
             Okay.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.655
      [lighthearted music]

25:26.659 --> 25:28.692
      What's the strangest
    thing you've ever seen?

25:32.064 --> 25:33.831
 Why do you make documentaries?

25:35.568 --> 25:36.300
            I, um...

25:38.804 --> 25:41.639
          I think I'm
     a pretty good witness
    of other people's lives,

25:41.641 --> 25:43.040
    other people's moments.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.112
 That's the pretentious answer.

25:50.216 --> 25:53.183
     The real answer is I'm
        more comfortable

25:53.185 --> 25:56.086
   with a camera in front of
   my face than without one.

26:01.827 --> 26:02.927
 Are you sure you want to hear?

26:02.929 --> 26:07.965
   'Cause it's about a ten on
  the crazy ways to die scale.

26:09.902 --> 26:10.834
         Then I'm sure.

26:10.836 --> 26:13.070
[Sam] <i> So there was this pigeon.</i>

26:13.072 --> 26:14.838
    <i> This pigeon who clearly</i>

26:14.840 --> 26:17.808
    <i> did not do his homework</i>
<i>in regards to peanut allergies,</i>

26:18.010 --> 26:21.145
 <i> and who obviously did not know</i>

26:21.147 --> 26:23.647
       that even a whiff
       of the tiny legume

26:23.649 --> 26:26.317
      can send some people
    into anaphylactic shock.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.587
    That dumb bird could've
  had no way of knowing that.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.723
   When he ate those peanuts
         in that park,

26:33.059 --> 26:37.127
he was however unintentionally,
    committing manslaughter.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.598
     47 people were killed
    by lightning that year.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.200
   75 by cataclysmic storms,

26:45.171 --> 26:47.771
 <i> and as far as I know, only one</i>

26:47.773 --> 26:51.175
    <i> has ever been killed by</i>
  <i> peanut infested pigeon poop.</i>

26:51.177 --> 26:54.078
           [laughing]

26:54.280 --> 26:57.781
  <i> Would've been a lot funnier</i>
      <i> if it wasn't my dad.</i>

26:59.752 --> 27:00.684
              Sam.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.020
             Yeah?

27:03.823 --> 27:05.322
 I'm pretty sure that's an 11.

27:08.728 --> 27:09.660
           At least.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.002
       I'm really sorry.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.148
     I can't believe you're
     doing this guy's dog,

27:31.150 --> 27:32.116
     you didn't even do me.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.417
    You just farmed me out.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.953
 You're spending all this time
   brushing this dog's hair,

27:35.955 --> 27:38.322
      and you didn't even
    spend a second with me.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.890
      Just threw me in the
       trash last night.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.759
   -I am not talking to you.
           -Why not?

27:41.761 --> 27:43.927
-Because I refuse to be insane.
      -Well, I don't think

27:43.929 --> 27:45.295
    you really have a choice
    on that matter, do you?

27:45.297 --> 27:46.664
        [grandma] <i> Molly!</i>

27:46.666 --> 27:48.032
           -Oh, shit.
             -What?

27:48.334 --> 27:49.266
  Where are you going, Molly?

27:52.805 --> 27:53.737
         I want to go.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.072
           [grandma]
    You can do this, Molly.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.074
 I have faith in you, come on.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.976
    Just one step at a time.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.081
   That's it, yes. That's it!

28:04.083 --> 28:05.916
       -No, I can't, Mom.
     -But if you just do--

28:05.918 --> 28:07.918
           -I can't!
         -Yes, you can!

28:07.920 --> 28:10.054
       -Get off my back!
    -I can't do it, I can't!

28:15.995 --> 28:17.061
      Where are you going?

28:21.133 --> 28:23.801
      What are you doing?
 What are you doing with that?

28:23.969 --> 28:25.102

       You almost hit me!

28:37.883 --> 28:39.383
What are you doing, you lunatic?

28:40.019 --> 28:41.285
        I'm driving you.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.020
          -What the--
         -Molly called.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.422
     Guess she wanted me on
     standby, just in case.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.257
         Just in case.
    Oh hey, can I have that?

28:47.993 --> 28:50.160
 You quit 20 years ago, you're
 supposed to be my inspiration.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.795
Yeah, some inspiration, come on.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.030
 It's not like I ever light it.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.364
      Then give it to me.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.366
      I only have the one.

28:58.437 --> 29:01.171

You know how some dogs will run

29:26.198 --> 29:27.998
    or bark in their sleep?

29:30.436 --> 29:31.368
           Not Tuck.

29:31.370 --> 29:35.139
      Tuck, when he slept,
         he would sing.

29:36.809 --> 29:43.080
          -Sing what?
  -I'm tone deaf, but I swear
    it was a howling version

29:43.082 --> 29:44.014
    of "Stairway to Heaven".

29:50.556 --> 29:51.488
              Wow.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.423
  Why does this hurt so much?

29:56.028 --> 29:58.362
     With my dad I was just
       numb, but this...

30:01.967 --> 30:02.966

30:05.404 --> 30:07.571
I think pets give us permission.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.977
   What you did for me today,

30:16.215 --> 30:17.915
    not many people would've
           done that.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.883
   Oh, it was nothing really.

30:20.853 --> 30:23.587
      I cleaned him up and
        brushed his fur.

          this is what

30:32.331 --> 30:33.497
you wanted to do with your life?

    Not every little girl's
        dream, you mean?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.437
     Well, for me, it was.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.574
  And this is my dad's place,

30:44.043 --> 30:46.043
and he wanted a son, he had me,

30:46.045 --> 30:48.178
    so he taught me instead.

30:49.148 --> 30:52.583
     And I would run around
     embalming my Barbies.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.286
 The strangest girl I ever met.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.256
     There's a pet cemetery
         over on Grove.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.491
 It's pretty, it's like a park.
   I could give them a call.

        No, no, no, no.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.228
      I got it from here.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.329
             Okay.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.135

32:33.619 --> 32:36.053
   If you were so interested,
   you could've come with me.

       I need more tests.

       awfully long time
   to just hear "More tests".

    at Loomer's for a drink.

 very popular with the bikers.

    Don't make me ask Frank
     what the doctor said,
        because I will.

They think it was a mini stroke,

43:17.596 --> 43:18.328
        I was wondering,

43:19.331 --> 43:21.864
           [mumbling]

43:22.701 --> 43:24.667
 I was just wondering if uh...

43:25.670 --> 43:26.903
   Who paid for the funeral?

43:31.710 --> 43:34.110
      She did. In advance.

43:35.046 --> 43:36.879
    It was very nice of you
     to stay the whole day.

43:37.215 --> 43:39.816
Oh, it wasn't quite the whole...

43:42.087 --> 43:43.252
      Would you like to go
     out with me sometime?

43:47.726 --> 43:49.626
            -Go out?
          -On a date.

43:49.628 --> 43:51.027
    I got it from here, Sam.

43:54.265 --> 43:55.198
             Oh...

43:56.001 --> 43:57.000
          Hello, Joe.

43:57.802 --> 44:01.304
Joe, I would like that, really,

44:04.075 --> 44:05.742
       but going out is a
   little bit tricky for me.

44:05.977 --> 44:06.909
              Why?

44:07.679 --> 44:08.978
        Yeah, Mom. Why?

44:09.114 --> 44:10.046
           There's...

44:10.048 --> 44:12.315
   For one thing, my mother's
         not very well.

44:12.317 --> 44:14.017
        I am just fine.

44:14.019 --> 44:16.319
     -Yeah, you should go.
           -Go where?

44:16.321 --> 44:17.787
      On a date with Joe.

44:17.789 --> 44:19.288
           God, yes.

44:19.290 --> 44:20.723
         Have some fun.

44:20.725 --> 44:22.058
            -Friday?
             -6:30?

44:22.694 --> 44:23.426
          It's a date.

44:24.262 --> 44:26.963
      [lighthearted music]

44:27.932 --> 44:29.832
  Oh shit, I'll be right back.

44:33.772 --> 44:36.139
    I may not have done this
in a while, but I'm pretty sure
         that was a no.

44:37.308 --> 44:39.976
Mom! You just walked out on him.

44:39.978 --> 44:41.177
   I can't do this right now.

44:41.179 --> 44:42.311
    You should have knocked!

44:42.981 --> 44:44.447
Seriously? That's your response?

44:44.449 --> 44:46.849
   I do not want to have this
     conversation with you.

44:46.851 --> 44:49.786
 I can go my whole life without
   having this conversation.

44:49.788 --> 44:50.853
       I am your mother,

44:50.855 --> 44:54.323
 and I have feelings and needs.

44:54.325 --> 44:56.693
       He was meant to be
        a gag gift, Mom.

44:56.695 --> 44:58.127
        Not a boyfriend.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.462
   Please just do it for me!

44:59.464 --> 45:00.830
            -Molly--
             -Okay.

45:02.767 --> 45:03.700
             Okay?

45:03.702 --> 45:04.467
            Really?

45:06.137 --> 45:08.905
   Um, then I'll pick you up.

45:08.907 --> 45:10.907
 Does Friday, 6:30 still work?

45:12.410 --> 45:15.311
   Seven. I volunteer at the
        animal shelter,

45:15.313 --> 45:17.113
   my first shift is Friday.

45:18.083 --> 45:19.082
         See you then?

45:20.218 --> 45:21.150
         See you then.

45:25.190 --> 45:26.122
          [chuckling]

45:26.725 --> 45:28.191
      What just happened?

45:28.326 --> 45:31.928
   You have a real, live date
   with a real, live person.

45:34.132 --> 45:35.064
    We need to get to work.

45:35.467 --> 45:36.399
            On what?

45:37.001 --> 45:37.934
           The plan.

45:42.407 --> 45:43.372
    Oh honey, fix your hair.

45:44.509 --> 45:45.842
             -Why?
 -[grandma] It's in your eyes.

45:45.844 --> 45:48.311
     Welcome to your online
         support group.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.346

46:04.162 --> 46:06.929
    <i> I got tired of not being</i>
    <i> able to go to the movies</i>

46:11.102 --> 46:13.269
  <i> Life got so small, you know?</i>

46:13.271 --> 46:14.437
       No, we don't know.

      You're nothing like
         these losers.

46:36.895 --> 46:38.861
     No, I don't think so.

46:39.030 --> 46:39.962
              Yes!

        A little faster.

47:00.318 --> 47:01.450
     A little faster, yes.

            Come in.

47:14.532 --> 47:16.232
              Hey!
 Do you want to play Scrabble?

47:16.234 --> 47:22.004
     Oh, I don't think so.
  I'm going to stay and finish
   the book that you gave me.

47:22.006 --> 47:25.441
        -Oh, how is it?
  -Good, I knew it would help.

47:25.443 --> 47:27.476
   Oh, I have to run out for
    a second. Lotto tickets.

47:28.246 --> 47:29.445
 You're not going to win, Mom.

47:30.415 --> 47:32.415
        Hey! It's okay,
       we can play later.

47:32.417 --> 47:34.083
  She's not going to win, Sam.

47:34.085 --> 47:36.319
    Well, somebody's got to.

47:36.321 --> 47:38.187
      Thank you, Sam. Hm!

47:43.328 --> 47:45.228
  Man, I'm glad they're gone.

47:45.897 --> 47:47.930
      I promised them I'd
       finish this book.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.534
     There's so many other
       productive things

47:51.536 --> 47:53.102
  we could be doing right now.

47:54.105 --> 47:55.037
           Like what?

47:56.941 --> 47:58.341
      I think you need to
       cancel that date.

47:59.010 --> 48:00.209
     I think you're right.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.143

          -I miss you.

          You did it!

48:51.562 --> 48:53.596
   [Sam] With the first pair,
    you got like 100 points.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.598
         [grandma] So,
  can you feel the cool breeze

48:55.600 --> 48:56.666

  -[Molly] A little bit, yes?
      -[grandma] And then
     the sunlight's on you.

Everything's peaceful and calm.

     You're coasting along
       on the bike ride.

      Soon you'll be doing
         this with Sam.

49:08.212 --> 49:09.712
    Won't that be wonderful?

49:09.714 --> 49:12.248
       Every time you do
       a step like this,

49:12.250 --> 49:13.983
      you're a step closer
      to freeing yourself.

         [catchy music]

49:35.540 --> 49:38.007

        out this weekend

    <i> Molly, that's wonderful.</i>

49:43.348 --> 49:45.581
  I've thought about canceling
      it about 100 times,

49:45.583 --> 49:47.183
     but I haven't yet, so.

49:47.185 --> 49:48.584
       <i> You didn't cancel.</i>

49:48.586 --> 49:50.353
      <i> That's huge, Molly.</i>

49:50.688 --> 49:53.422
 [woman] <i> You should be really,</i>
   <i> really proud of yourself.</i>

49:57.095 --> 49:58.327
 I have a plan, I have a plan.

         Yes! Let's go!

 [grandma] Honey, you got this!
     I know you can do it.

50:07.171 --> 50:09.005
     Yes, you got it, Mom.

        -[Sam] Come on!
  -[grandma] You got it, Mom.

50:10.408 --> 50:11.640

       Did you see that?

50:26.691 --> 50:28.424
   Yeah, what's the big deal?

50:29.060 --> 50:30.426
        I went outside!

50:30.528 --> 50:32.294
         I was outside!

50:32.296 --> 50:34.463
     For like ten seconds.

50:35.066 --> 50:37.733
     Wow, congratulations.

50:39.337 --> 50:40.436
      Don't be like that.

50:49.380 --> 50:50.679
   Where are your cuff links?

50:54.152 --> 50:55.084
          Hey, Frank.

50:55.086 --> 50:57.386
       I'm missing a pair
         of cuff links.

50:58.156 --> 51:00.222
       -I'll look around.
       -Okay, thank you.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.093
   Didn't have a girlfriend?

51:05.229 --> 51:06.162
           Boyfriend?

51:09.067 --> 51:11.434
     How many dates did you
       go on in 25 years?

51:13.271 --> 51:14.537
  I'm going on a date tonight.

51:16.541 --> 51:17.506
         I know, right?

51:19.410 --> 51:20.342
         I'm terrified.

51:22.313 --> 51:23.779
 I don't remember how to do it.

51:26.651 --> 51:27.616
       How do you do it?

51:32.457 --> 51:33.756
       Well, what's wrong
         with that one?

51:33.758 --> 51:35.591
  [Molly] God, it's so purple.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.126
      And the other four?

51:38.796 --> 51:41.864
 Would you hand me those jeans?

51:43.134 --> 51:45.434
  Ugh, no. Not the mom jeans.

51:45.436 --> 51:47.136
        Here, try these.

51:47.505 --> 51:48.804
  Oh my God, these are so old.

51:49.874 --> 51:52.374
      Well, so old they've
     come back into style.

51:57.281 --> 52:00.216
      What makes you think
 I'm actually going to make it
        outside tonight?

52:01.285 --> 52:02.751
  You've been working so hard.

52:03.454 --> 52:04.487
    I'm really proud of you.

52:11.496 --> 52:13.896
Yes! That is the one. I love it.

52:14.432 --> 52:15.631
             -Yeah?
             -Yeah.

             Okay.

52:20.705 --> 52:21.770
  Where are you going tonight?

52:23.341 --> 52:25.407
Frank's dropping me at Rachel's.

52:28.379 --> 52:29.745
Where'd you get those earrings?

52:31.782 --> 52:33.682
   Oh, Gram gave them to me.

52:34.418 --> 52:35.384
    [Molly] They're pretty.

52:35.386 --> 52:36.685
            Thanks.

52:36.687 --> 52:38.721
       Okay, hold still.

52:40.758 --> 52:42.658
     Don't you need to blot
        it or something?

52:46.797 --> 52:47.863
          Done! Okay.

52:47.865 --> 52:49.632
       Have so much fun.

52:50.535 --> 52:51.700
          -I love you.
      -[Molly] I love you.

52:51.802 --> 52:57.873
     -Oh, and don't forget.
             -Okay.

 for Sam, I promised. I can't.

    picking my own produce,

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:43.604
      Like, we're cursed.

01:15:45.108 --> 01:15:48.209
 Sam, that is not why I'm here.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:51.646
         -Go home, Joe.
             -Sam--

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.881
       Don't you get it?
    We don't want you here.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.616
             -Sam.
          -Just leave!

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:58.686
            Go, now!

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.091
            Just go.

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:10.565
              Go.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:17.004
          [door slams]

01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:32.887
      I have to tell her.

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:36.691
    About how you killed me?
    That's a terrible idea.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:53.975
        I yelled at Joe.

01:16:56.012 --> 01:16:57.011
        [Molly] I heard.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.253
   Do you think we're cursed?

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:09.190
              No.

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:11.959
   I think we're just alive.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.232
     I yelled at your dad.

01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:24.672
        The day he died.

01:17:26.743 --> 01:17:28.142
My birthday, we had a big fight.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.847
     The last thing I ever
     said to him was mean.

01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:47.428
              Why?

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:55.069
Because he loved me, and I felt
  entirely unlovable that day,

01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:58.806
    and I thought I had all
     the time in the world
     to make it up to him.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.414
I wouldn't let him take the car.

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:09.216
 I said I needed it, I didn't.

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:13.821
  So he rode that stupid bike.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:18.793
     I wanted to tell you,
      but I just couldn't.

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:24.899
         And I'm sorry.

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:30.838
    I'll be in my room if...

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:36.977
      I'll be in my room.

01:19:12.815 --> 01:19:13.948
         I told you so.

01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:17.818
        [doorbell rings]

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:24.358
        Hi, sweetheart!

01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:26.861
       Oh, are you okay?

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:28.362
   Of course she's not okay.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:29.296
       How's your mother?

01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:31.432
     She's doing all right.

01:19:31.768 --> 01:19:34.268
          -[lady] Oh.
            -We won!

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:37.271
        -We finally won!
             -What?

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:38.405
[lady] But not the whole thing.

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:40.141
 No, just a couple of numbers.

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:42.810
      But enough to get an
    upgrade to first class,

01:19:43.146 --> 01:19:46.313
     or maybe a hotel suite
    on that trip to Moscow.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:49.884
     -We all agree that Ivy
   would want you to have it.
             -Yes.

01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:53.487
     [Susan] Oh, honey, oh.

01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:56.257
      Sweetheart, you take
       care of yourself.

01:19:56.259 --> 01:19:57.992
   -[lady] Yeah, we love you.
             -Okay.

01:19:57.994 --> 01:19:59.527
 Now we have to get out of here
   and let her do her thing.

01:19:59.529 --> 01:20:00.461
           -Let's go.
         -[woman] Yeah.

        [phone ringing]

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:33.494
       Don't answer that.

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:34.495
      No, I have to do it.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:38.098
             Hello?

01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:40.601
      This is Mrs. Lewis.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.539
           She what?

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:49.343
       Where is she now?

01:20:51.581 --> 01:20:54.882
   You didn't keep her there?
        She's a kid, she
       could be anywhere.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.158
   Never mind, I'll find her.
      Thanks for calling.

01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:06.393
            Oh, God.

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:09.997
  I have to go. Sam needs me!

01:21:09.999 --> 01:21:11.365
        I need you more.

01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:15.502
     What did you just say?

01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:20.875
      What are you doing?

01:21:20.877 --> 01:21:22.376
             -Move.
       -You're not well.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:23.444
       Get out of my way.

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:24.979
     Ivy said you're sick.

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:29.283
      No. You're not real.

01:21:29.285 --> 01:21:30.484
 Just forget about the outside,

01:21:30.486 --> 01:21:32.186
    forget about everything,

01:21:32.188 --> 01:21:34.221
    -forget about the pain.
       -You're not real.

         -You're a lie.
    -Is this what you want?
              Huh?

01:21:40.029 --> 01:21:41.662
   -Okay, you're hurting me.
 -What kind of mother are you?

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:43.330
 You're hurting me, let me go.

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:46.033
 -If you love her, let her go.
          -Let me go!

01:21:46.035 --> 01:21:47.401
       You're only going
        to mess her up.

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.470
    That's it. You're going
          to ruin her,

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:52.306
       just like you ruin
        everything else.

01:21:52.308 --> 01:21:53.507
     You're never going to
      make it without Ivy.

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:56.443
         You know why?
     'Cause you killed her.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.347
  Yeah. If you would've stayed
      in the fucking house

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.017
      she'd still be here.

01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:05.686
        [dramatic music]

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:09.924
         There you go.

       It's okay, Molls.

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:16.397
       I'm here for you.

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:17.965
  I'll always be here for you.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:23.604
    Let's just be together,
    like we were in Moscow.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:26.891
         Remember that?

01:22:26.892 --> 01:22:27.675
     No one's going to love
      you like I love you.

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:33.948
       You don't have to
        change anything,

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:36.417
       you don't have to
       be strong anymore,

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:41.255
you don't have to love anybody.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.223
         Just love me.

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:50.698
      You don't need Sam,
        just let her go.

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:56.403
      Get the fuck off me.

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:00.007

01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:01.542
             Molly!

         [somber music]

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:43.751
           [Ivy] So,

01:23:46.455 --> 01:23:47.388
        did you find it?

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:49.590
              Sam.

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:51.792
           It's Sam.

01:23:51.794 --> 01:23:57.197
       -Why can't I move?
     -Because you think you
   have to stop being afraid.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:05.105
  You won the lotto, $10,000.

01:24:05.107 --> 01:24:06.040
              Oh.

01:24:07.176 --> 01:24:08.142
  I thought you'd be happier.

01:24:08.144 --> 01:24:11.345
    Winning isn't the point,
 the point is playing the game.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:13.647
     Now, go get our girl.

01:24:16.419 --> 01:24:17.351
              Sam.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.754
         [somber music]

01:25:05.334 --> 01:25:06.467
         It looks good.

01:25:06.836 --> 01:25:08.202
       No thanks to you.

01:25:09.538 --> 01:25:10.471
      Where are you going?

01:25:10.539 --> 01:25:11.638
             Away.

01:25:12.408 --> 01:25:13.607
    I hear it's nice there.

01:25:13.742 --> 01:25:14.775
             Stop.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.612
        I don't get it.

01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:24.418
How are you out here right now?

01:25:26.222 --> 01:25:27.788
     I found the thing that
    was bigger than my fear.

01:25:28.858 --> 01:25:29.790
              You.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:34.561
     All I can tell you is
     that if you come home,

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:37.498
   I promise I will be there
        for you, always.

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:43.537
 And I plan to be available for
all kinds of outdoor activities.

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:49.643
Maybe we could start with going
    to an authentic Russian
          restaurant,

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:51.311
    and do Moscow next year?

01:25:54.617 --> 01:25:57.284
     But if you do go away,
      or wherever you go,

01:25:59.522 --> 01:26:01.188
   send me a postcard, okay?

01:26:04.527 --> 01:26:06.293
             -Mom.
             -Yeah?

01:26:07.163 --> 01:26:08.695
Can you give this back to Gram?

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:14.601
       Grandma would want
        you to have it.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:21.675
        Sam, I love you.

01:26:22.778 --> 01:26:23.710
            So much.

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:26.947
           [sobbing]

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.519
    Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:39.760
           You okay?

01:26:43.299 --> 01:26:44.898
    Come on, let's go home.

01:27:03.219 --> 01:27:05.419
 I went to Mr. Dawson's house.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:07.921
          The earrings
     belonged to his wife.

01:27:08.958 --> 01:27:09.957
        How did that go?

01:27:11.527 --> 01:27:12.459
           Not well.

01:27:14.296 --> 01:27:15.996
       The next ten might
        not be so easy.

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:18.665
            I know.

01:27:26.242 --> 01:27:28.408
     I need you to look up
       an address for me.

01:27:30.446 --> 01:27:31.378
             Whose?

01:27:37.886 --> 01:27:38.952
           You knock.

01:27:40.256 --> 01:27:41.521
           [knocking]

01:27:56.372 --> 01:27:58.005
     Be shocked later, just
       listen now, okay?

01:27:59.942 --> 01:28:01.441
       You're right, I'm
        not over Peter.

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:05.912
But I don't think that I'm built
     to get over the people
    that I love and I lose.

01:28:07.516 --> 01:28:08.982
 And I do want to keep living,

01:28:08.984 --> 01:28:10.550
     and I do want to learn
       how to love again,

01:28:10.552 --> 01:28:11.952
  and I do want to make space.

01:28:12.688 --> 01:28:13.987
  And I know that I come with

01:28:13.989 --> 01:28:15.822
      more than the usual
       amount of baggage,

01:28:16.358 --> 01:28:17.958
       it's probably more
      than you can fit in

01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:20.544
    an overhead compartment,

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:21.327
     but if you think that
       maybe your baggage

01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:24.765
      and my baggage could
        somehow... fit,

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:28.935
           I'm here.

01:28:31.373 --> 01:28:33.307
   And there's space for you.

01:28:34.343 --> 01:28:35.575
       In your suitcase.

01:28:37.079 --> 01:28:38.011
             Yeah.

01:28:40.616 --> 01:28:41.748
          And in mine.

01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:43.583
 We're kind of a package deal.

01:28:48.357 --> 01:28:51.625
     I'm really sorry that
        I yelled at you.

01:28:52.328 --> 01:28:53.560
    I didn't mean any of it.

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:56.663
   Don't answer anything now,

01:28:57.333 --> 01:28:58.632
   just think about it, okay?

01:29:00.469 --> 01:29:01.401
             Okay.

01:29:03.405 --> 01:29:04.338
             Okay.

01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:30.997
      [lighthearted music]

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:34.935
  It was a beautiful service.

01:29:36.138 --> 01:29:39.072
      [lighthearted music]

01:30:01.663 --> 01:30:03.930
           [laughing]

01:30:27.523 --> 01:30:29.489
          -Bye, Frank.
           -Bye, Sam.

01:30:38.801 --> 01:30:39.966
     She was one of a kind.

01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:44.704
         Yes, she was.

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:48.041
   It's good to see you out.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.076
          [chuckling]

01:30:51.013 --> 01:30:52.112
      It's good to be out.

01:30:55.717 --> 01:30:58.151
         So, I'll, um,
       see you on Monday?

01:30:59.521 --> 01:31:00.987
 I'll see you on Monday, Frank.

01:31:03.225 --> 01:31:06.560
      [lighthearted music]

01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:46.500
        [doorbell rings]

01:31:50.072 --> 01:31:51.838
              -Hi.
              -Hi.

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:54.274
    So, I thought about it,

01:31:55.077 --> 01:31:58.545
    and I like your luggage.

01:32:00.582 --> 01:32:01.515
             A lot.

01:32:01.817 --> 01:32:05.051
      And it matches mine,

01:32:05.787 --> 01:32:07.587
    which I thought was damn
        near impossible.

01:32:08.757 --> 01:32:09.689
             So...

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:16.296
            Hi, Joe.

01:32:17.733 --> 01:32:18.999
           Hey, Sam.

01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:21.101
       So I brought this.

01:32:23.572 --> 01:32:24.804
         It's a picnic.

01:32:24.806 --> 01:32:27.674
   Sort of a Russian picnic.

01:32:28.844 --> 01:32:31.111
          -Seriously?
      -Yep, I got borscht,

01:32:31.113 --> 01:32:33.880
   and well, it's not really
  borscht 'cause I didn't have
     the right ingredients,

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:34.948
     but it's cabbage soup.

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:37.584
And I got three beets and vodka.

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.252
       Black tea for you.

01:32:39.988 --> 01:32:40.921
            Thanks.

01:32:42.824 --> 01:32:44.257
  And this is a picnic, right?

01:32:44.826 --> 01:32:45.759
            Um, yep.

01:32:46.995 --> 01:32:49.029
     And picnics are meant
     to be enjoyed outside?

01:32:49.998 --> 01:32:50.931
              Yep.

01:32:51.767 --> 01:32:52.966
             Okay.

01:32:52.968 --> 01:32:55.101
Let's go have a picnic, outside.

01:33:01.577 --> 01:33:04.711
