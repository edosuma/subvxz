13:26.341 --> 13:29.583
- Drina, you don't have
to be embarrassed.

13:29.584 --> 13:31.985
Your daughter is
a beautiful writer.

13:31.986 --> 13:34.428
We had her slotted to read
in a prime-time spot

Good luck with that.

14:30.805 --> 14:32.486

why don't you come with me?

15:01.275 --> 15:02.876
You said that he was in trouble.

15:02.877 --> 15:05.038
- It wasn't him.
He's fine.

15:05.039 --> 15:06.600
It's something else.

Young lady last seen
alive in this house.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.881
I'm sure you're down
with the basic biology.

16:27.882 --> 16:29.202
Semen inside the victim means

16:29.203 --> 16:31.685
she had sex with someone
before she died.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.647
-Nick's not here.

16:33.648 --> 16:37.451

you're not talking to him.

- This goes a lot easier
if you cooperate.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.417
-You already ambushed him once.

16:43.418 --> 16:46.381

doesn't go as far as it used to.

She wanted to.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.082
We had sex.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.325
Kind of.
It was weird and sloppy,

18:31.326 --> 18:34.167
and there were people
in the house.

18:34.168 --> 18:37.010
I don't want to talk about this.
- You have to, son.

18:37.011 --> 18:39.494
-It was her idea!

18:41.736 --> 18:45.178
She said we could hook up
if I wanted to, so we did.

18:45.179 --> 18:50.344
Then she said I had to go
and get some morning after pill,

18:50.345 --> 18:53.667
and that's what was in the bag
you were teasing me about.

18:53.668 --> 18:59.513
I would never hurt her, I swear.
- I know. I know that, son.

18:59.514 --> 19:03.837

to tell this to a lawyer.

19:03.838 --> 19:07.160
- A lawyer?
I didn't do anything.

19:07.161 --> 19:08.682
- Nick, everything is
gonna be all right.
