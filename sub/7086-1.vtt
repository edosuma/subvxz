00:39.000 --> 00:43.766
My Kristina of Sweden!

00:43.800 --> 00:50.100
I implore you to call
upon your cleverness!

00:50.133 --> 00:55.566
I beseech you,
in the name of our Lord!

00:55.600 --> 00:58.533
Save your Empire!

01:42.466 --> 01:44.267
Kristina!

01:48.533 --> 01:51.100
Kristina!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.566
Good night, Your Majesty.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.200
See you tomorrow.

02:18.133 --> 02:20.267
The queen Mother
refuses to see you!

02:28.833 --> 02:31.566
Chancellor, how dare you
force your way into my quarters.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.366
I've come to save your
daughter from your madness

02:34.399 --> 02:36.300
and to remove
he king's body.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.466
- Not so soon!
- Soon?

02:38.499 --> 02:40.333
He's been on your
bed for two years!

02:46.300 --> 02:46.967
His heart!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.366
Look at that mad, mad woman...

02:49.399 --> 02:51.800
She shows no respect
to our king. Go.

02:51.833 --> 02:53.433
Nein! Nein...

02:54.333 --> 02:56.366
Ah Kristina, Kristina!
Come...

02:58.133 --> 03:01.300
Kristina, Kristina...
Come, come!

03:01.333 --> 03:03.013
Come! Kristina.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.067
Kristina...

03:08.433 --> 03:08.933
Get the body.

03:08.967 --> 03:10.067
Kristina!

03:10.100 --> 03:11.600
Kristina!

03:16.333 --> 03:18.666
Kristina...

03:35.366 --> 03:36.466
Kristina?

03:36.499 --> 03:37.766
Kristina.

04:06.633 --> 04:08.666
Happy Birthday your majesty.

04:20.366 --> 04:22.366
Control your anger.

04:24.299 --> 04:25.733
Suppress your tears.

04:29.233 --> 04:31.133
Were you aware of her shoulder?

04:31.167 --> 04:32.033
A distracted servant.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.733
She fell down
a flight of stairs.

04:35.466 --> 04:36.333
The child is in good health.

04:38.299 --> 04:40.333
I remember when you were born...

04:40.366 --> 04:42.566
Your first cry was so deep,

04:42.600 --> 04:45.499
we thought it was
the long awaited prince.

04:45.533 --> 04:48.800
So we took you to your father
and he unwrapped the blanket.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.499
A girl...

04:50.533 --> 04:53.733
But she must be very clever,
because she fooled us all.

04:53.766 --> 04:56.100
She will be
raised like a prince.

04:56.133 --> 04:59.833
Rules for the training
of the mind, by Descartes!

04:59.867 --> 05:01.233
A Catholic!

05:01.266 --> 05:02.800
That is blasphemy.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.167
To be uneducated
in this world of ours,

05:05.199 --> 05:07.067
that would be blasphemy.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.366
Heresy!

05:08.399 --> 05:09.433
How dare you!

05:09.466 --> 05:11.499
- Stop!
- From now on...

05:11.533 --> 05:15.033
We will decide what you read.

05:15.133 --> 05:15.833
Luther is right.

05:15.867 --> 05:18.266
The Pope is an aberration and...

05:18.299 --> 05:19.533
and his infallibility...

05:19.566 --> 05:20.833
a fraud.

05:20.867 --> 05:22.433
I'm glad to see you've
come to your senses...

05:22.466 --> 05:25.833
But I still think
Luther's austerity is sadistic.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.366
He sees the devil everywhere.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.366
Even in a fly.

05:30.399 --> 05:32.666
I'll bring back
your favorite books.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.333
Descartes?

05:34.366 --> 05:35.199
If you wish.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.399
Even Descartes...

05:57.466 --> 05:59.033
28.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.333
12.

06:02.399 --> 06:04.266
Her Majesty is in good health.

06:26.099 --> 06:27.666
Happy eighteenth birthday.

06:32.466 --> 06:36.067
With your father's sword,
Sweden is yours.

07:06.666 --> 07:08.633
I'll lay a treasure
at your feet.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.800
The greatest
treasure in the world?

07:16.833 --> 07:18.166
Yes!

07:18.199 --> 07:19.733
The greatest
treasure in the world.

07:19.766 --> 07:21.733
I'll grant your deepest desire.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.333
Just ask me!

07:28.399 --> 07:30.099
Like Luther,

07:30.132 --> 07:32.399
I want to spend a night
with the devil.

07:35.099 --> 07:36.700
Do you really think
he's the one

07:36.733 --> 07:39.433
who will lay
the devil at your feet?

07:47.433 --> 07:51.299
On this sacred day,
may I call you my daughter?

08:43.832 --> 08:46.533
Did I see you speak
to her on my behalf?

08:46.566 --> 08:48.766
She needs to feel loved,
convince her.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.166
They haven't brought me your
Royal Proclamation speech.

08:56.199 --> 08:57.800
And they won't be bringing it.

08:57.833 --> 08:59.066
Why?

08:59.099 --> 09:01.066
Because that's what I decided.

09:01.099 --> 09:03.533
Do you realize the
importance of this speech?

09:03.566 --> 09:04.533
Yes!

09:04.566 --> 09:07.833
And I've been preparing
for it since childhood.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.166
This is a fine occasion
for you to trust her.

09:10.199 --> 09:11.266
Stop it.

09:11.299 --> 09:12.433
Father...

09:12.466 --> 09:13.466
Let Kristina show you

09:13.499 --> 09:16.533
that you have every reason
to be proud of her.

09:16.566 --> 09:18.633
Very well.

09:18.666 --> 09:21.333
I'll hold you both responsible
for the consequences.

09:24.366 --> 09:27.233
Her majesty, Queen Kristina!

09:29.833 --> 09:32.266
How radiant and proud she is!

09:33.466 --> 09:35.333
What a marvelous
day for our kingdom!

09:35.366 --> 09:37.333
You, Kristina, on the throne.

09:39.266 --> 09:40.633
Yes!

09:41.566 --> 09:43.399
Your majesty...

09:43.433 --> 09:45.666
Your humble servant.

09:45.700 --> 09:49.700
Magnus, I take umbrage
at your splendid attire.

09:49.733 --> 09:51.800
If Your Majesty wishes,
I shall take everything off.

09:51.833 --> 09:54.166
And I should take
umbrage all the more.

09:56.266 --> 09:58.800
May I introduce you
to Monsieur Pierre Chanut,

09:58.833 --> 10:01.533
France's distinguished
ambassador to our country.

10:01.566 --> 10:03.266
Your Majesty.

10:03.299 --> 10:04.566
Monsieur.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.533
Despite our
religious differences,

10:06.566 --> 10:07.833
Sweden accepts France,

10:07.867 --> 10:10.700
the eldest daughter
of the Church of Rome,

10:10.733 --> 10:12.833
as our greatest ally.

10:12.867 --> 10:16.600
We are stealing souls
from the Holy German Empire,

10:16.633 --> 10:19.333
while you are stealing
their provinces.

10:25.034 --> 10:29.434
¿Is it not easy to be friend
when one has the same enemy?

10:29.735 --> 10:30.985
Of course.

10:32.236 --> 10:36.336
I'v heard you are friend with
Rene Descates, the philosopher.

10:36.437 --> 10:38.037
It's my honor, yes.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.038
You should tell me everything
about him.

10:42.035 --> 10:42.785
Of course.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.266
Jakob!

10:43.299 --> 10:46.099
You remember
my younger brother, Jakob?

10:46.132 --> 10:48.800
Some say he's even
handsomer than me.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.166
Your Majesty.

10:50.199 --> 10:52.733
My fiancée,
Countess Ebba Sparre.

10:54.132 --> 10:56.032
Your Majesty.

11:01.832 --> 11:04.032
We must all take umbrage.

11:22.399 --> 11:24.299
I don't see my mother.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.499
She left.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.799
Still at your papa's side I see?

11:32.832 --> 11:36.499
Everytime I see you,
the same image comes to mind.

11:36.533 --> 11:38.466
What image is that my friend?

11:38.499 --> 11:41.233
You can open a dog's
mouth to teach him to talk...

11:41.266 --> 11:42.333
But...

11:42.366 --> 11:45.433
It just goes on, barking.

11:48.299 --> 11:50.366
Lovely to see you again.

11:50.399 --> 11:52.099
Did you bring
my first revolution?

11:52.132 --> 11:54.366
I was olny waiting for you
to give the order, my queen.

11:54.399 --> 11:55.600
Now!

11:58.433 --> 12:01.233
For our gracious
majesty's pleasure!

12:38.333 --> 12:39.600
It's time now.

12:40.466 --> 12:42.466
Everything will be fine.

12:42.499 --> 12:44.366
Show them what you're made of!

12:45.732 --> 12:48.032
The Queen!

12:58.233 --> 13:00.799
Today I came of age

13:00.832 --> 13:04.765
and I solemnly received
my father's crown.

13:04.799 --> 13:10.199
The crown of the great
Gustav, Lion of the North,

13:10.233 --> 13:11.633
who gave his life

13:11.666 --> 13:14.600
fighting to defend
the glory of Sweden.

13:18.166 --> 13:23.099
And I, like him, intend
to work day and night

13:23.132 --> 13:25.466
for the glory of our kingdom,

13:25.499 --> 13:30.132
in keeping with the teachings
of Luther, our spiritual guide.

13:33.799 --> 13:40.333
I inherited from my father
a country of miners

13:40.366 --> 13:46.199
and lumberjacks,
of peasants and soldiers.

13:46.233 --> 13:51.132
Ignorance and illiteracy are
rampant in the lower classes,

13:51.166 --> 13:56.333
people scorn scholars and
are suspicious of knowledge.

13:58.866 --> 14:05.499
The French philosopher,
René Descartes, says...

14:05.533 --> 14:08.600
that curiosity is a great asset.

14:08.633 --> 14:13.299
Says it predisposes us to
acquire scientific knowledge.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.832
He says...

14:14.866 --> 14:19.832
the best remedy,
for excessive admiration,

14:19.866 --> 14:23.765
is to acquire knowledge
of many things,

14:23.799 --> 14:26.066
and to practice appreciation

14:26.099 --> 14:30.266
of those that seem
most rare and strange.

14:31.266 --> 14:33.132
We must build schools!

14:33.166 --> 14:34.132
Theaters!

14:34.166 --> 14:35.600
Libraries!

14:35.632 --> 14:37.799
We must welcome
the finest thinkers

14:37.832 --> 14:40.399
and those banned
for their ideas.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.665
I want to make my country

14:43.699 --> 14:47.466
the most sophisticated
country in Europe.

14:47.499 --> 14:52.333
Let us become curious and
make Stockholm the new Athens!

14:56.166 --> 14:58.366
To achieve this dream...

14:58.399 --> 15:01.499
We must tackle
the greatest challenge

15:01.533 --> 15:04.799
in the history
of this country...

15:04.832 --> 15:06.566
Peace!

15:06.599 --> 15:07.533
Peace?

15:07.566 --> 15:08.765
We must bring an end
to these years of war

15:08.799 --> 15:10.433
with the Holy Roman Empire.

15:10.466 --> 15:11.599
With the Catholics?!

15:11.632 --> 15:15.632
Nothing is more
difficult than peace.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.099
Thirty years of war...

15:17.132 --> 15:18.832
Thousands and thousands
of deaths

15:18.866 --> 15:20.299
to ensure that Luther's faith,

15:20.333 --> 15:22.832
prevails over the North
of this continent.

15:22.866 --> 15:25.399
And you would like us
to abandon these goals?!

15:25.433 --> 15:27.799
We got drunk
on the blood of Catholics.

15:27.832 --> 15:30.132
And now we are supposed
to dilute everything

15:30.166 --> 15:31.299
with poetry and song!

15:31.333 --> 15:32.565
Sit down...

15:32.599 --> 15:34.366
When pretty phrases
and sweet melodies

15:34.399 --> 15:36.099
have lulled us to sleep,

15:36.132 --> 15:38.433
Catholic Germany will
rise and, brandishing Rome,

15:38.466 --> 15:40.366
they will return
to stab us in the back!

15:40.399 --> 15:42.099
- The way they did your father!
- Sit down!

15:42.132 --> 15:45.199
This is her majesty,
Queen Kristina of Sweden!

15:45.233 --> 15:48.233
And when the queen speaks,
she commands!

16:13.132 --> 16:13.732
Wait!

16:13.765 --> 16:15.199
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

16:18.166 --> 16:20.066
I shall protect you.

16:20.099 --> 16:22.333
I shall love you,
day and night.

16:22.366 --> 16:24.066
Marry me!

16:24.099 --> 16:25.266
What?

16:25.299 --> 16:25.966
Make me your king!

16:25.999 --> 16:28.199
I have just introduced myself

16:28.233 --> 16:29.599
and presented
my plans to the world

16:29.632 --> 16:31.665
and you are talking to me
about marriage.

16:31.699 --> 16:36.233
The moon has barely risen
on the first day of my reign,

16:36.266 --> 16:40.199
and I've already received
countless proposals.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.299
The Great Elector
of Brandenburg,

16:43.333 --> 16:45.199
the King of Hungary.

16:45.233 --> 16:47.732
Even Philip of Spain!

16:47.765 --> 16:51.099
An incurable syphilitic!

16:51.132 --> 16:54.132
Am I just a pawn for the taking?

16:54.166 --> 16:57.433
You don't need those kings,
you have me!

16:57.466 --> 16:59.066
- Marry me!
- No!

16:59.099 --> 17:01.166
I'll support
all your revolutions,

17:01.199 --> 17:03.166
we've talked about
this Kristina!

17:03.199 --> 17:05.565
I brought you the china
and the crystal...

17:05.598 --> 17:06.665
NO!!!

17:09.233 --> 17:10.699
No...

17:13.333 --> 17:15.498
You need not
to unpack your trunks.

17:16.732 --> 17:18.665
I'm sending you back to Paris.

17:18.699 --> 17:19.799
But Kristina...

17:19.832 --> 17:22.132
You heard her...

17:22.165 --> 17:24.165
You're going back to Paris.

17:26.398 --> 17:30.266
And I'm sending you
to the German front.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.632
Do you dare object?

17:35.565 --> 17:36.599
No...

17:36.632 --> 17:40.432
We need to demonstrate
our strength on all fronts

17:40.465 --> 17:43.199
during these peace negotiations.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.066
Of course.

17:45.099 --> 17:46.399
But...

17:46.432 --> 17:49.132
I'll keep all of my promises.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.565
I swear I will!

17:56.299 --> 17:57.565
Let her go.

18:49.266 --> 18:54.266
Custodiat animam
tuam in vitam aeternam.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.532
Amen.

19:00.333 --> 19:04.433
Matar a un católico es casi un
deber patriótico en Suecia.

19:05.434 --> 19:06.234
¿La Reina?

19:08.035 --> 19:12.235
Su Canciller quiere volverla
una máquina de gobernar.

19:12.636 --> 19:16.536
Mientras ella sólo está interesada
en citar a filósofos y poetas.

19:17.337 --> 19:18.837
Dicen que es curiosa.

19:19.138 --> 19:21.738
Sí y nosotros sacaremos
provecho de esa curiosidad.

19:22.039 --> 19:24.939
El Papa promete enviar todo
el apoyo que se necesite.

19:36.398 --> 19:39.266
You gave a courageous
speech, your Majesty.

19:39.299 --> 19:41.166
Some called it suicidal.

19:41.199 --> 19:43.099
You were guided
by your free will.

19:43.132 --> 19:44.498
My what?

19:44.532 --> 19:47.298
René Descartes is
currently living in Holland.

19:47.332 --> 19:49.799
He's studying
the passions of the soul.

19:49.832 --> 19:51.465
The passions of the soul?

19:51.498 --> 19:54.132
How to recognize them
in order to master them.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.199
There is no need
to study our passions,

19:56.233 --> 19:57.699
they're all bad for the soul.

19:57.732 --> 20:00.066
Our lives are
determined in advance.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.799
Life is God's gift to us,

20:01.832 --> 20:04.166
and He alone
is in charge of our fate.

20:04.199 --> 20:06.132
Beware of Catholics,
your Majesty...

20:06.166 --> 20:08.332
They practice loose theology.

20:09.199 --> 20:11.565
Shall we talk about
these peace negotiations?

20:11.599 --> 20:13.632
I expect they will be difficult.

20:15.132 --> 20:18.132
Johan, you would make
a fine negotiator for us.

20:18.166 --> 20:18.799
What?

20:18.832 --> 20:20.166
In Osnabruck.

20:20.199 --> 20:21.799
You're sending me to Germany?

20:21.832 --> 20:24.132
Who could better
represent me than you?

20:24.166 --> 20:28.732
Johan is grateful,
your majesty, for this honour.

20:28.765 --> 20:31.199
Yes, of course, thank you.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.565
It's about time!

20:43.832 --> 20:46.532
What is she doing here?

20:46.565 --> 20:51.066
From now on, I'll be choosing
my ladies-in-waiting myself.

20:52.832 --> 20:54.799
The "lady's seat"
restricts us to trotting,

20:54.832 --> 20:56.432
and it makes us look ridiculous.

20:56.465 --> 20:57.699
Get down.

20:58.832 --> 21:00.565
Give her your saddle.

21:00.599 --> 21:04.265
How do you expect me to feel,
she's sending me away...

21:04.298 --> 21:06.599
She has to learn
to appreciate your worth...

21:06.632 --> 21:07.765
Oh, really?
From a distance?

21:07.799 --> 21:10.599
No, make sure you're
the best negotiator possible,

21:10.632 --> 21:12.832
impress her.

21:12.866 --> 21:15.565
She wants to keep
all the power for herself.

21:17.398 --> 21:20.665
I'll make sure
she doesn't forget you.

21:20.866 --> 21:22.432
Follow me!

22:06.866 --> 22:09.599
By the rusty nails
of Christ's cross,

22:09.632 --> 22:11.066
this is delicious!

22:12.232 --> 22:14.198
I've been eating and hunting
bear since I was a child,

22:14.232 --> 22:15.632
but this...

22:15.665 --> 22:17.599
This is something else.

22:17.632 --> 22:23.066
Shallots, garlic,
and, important...

22:23.099 --> 22:27.332
One or two measures
of french white wine.

22:27.365 --> 22:30.132
- Santé, your Majesty!
- Santé...

22:31.465 --> 22:32.465
Look!

22:32.498 --> 22:35.099
This is a tomato...

22:35.131 --> 22:38.665
It comes from Spain's New World.

22:38.699 --> 22:43.198
They're also called
"love apples".

22:49.398 --> 22:50.365
Come...

22:50.398 --> 22:52.131
Come sit here...

22:52.165 --> 22:53.498
At your table?

22:53.532 --> 22:54.599
Come!

23:02.298 --> 23:05.499
Life is meant to be gray until
we earn the final darkness.

23:07.931 --> 23:10.499
Don't you think we
can add a bit of colour?

23:11.832 --> 23:14.332
I find all this very exciting...

23:15.165 --> 23:16.665
and disturbing.

23:17.399 --> 23:20.232
By whose authority are you
dining with our sovereign?

23:21.532 --> 23:24.731
I thank you, madame,
for this delicious dinner.

23:24.731 --> 23:28.498
And ladies-in-waiting should not
be dining, at the queen's table.

23:28.798 --> 23:29.465
Chancellor...

23:30.098 --> 23:32.232
I invited the ambassador myself.

23:32.232 --> 23:33.731
A Jesuit scoundrel!

23:33.965 --> 23:35.132
A Catholic recruiter.

23:35.365 --> 23:37.265
How can you be so careless!

23:37.776 --> 23:40.609
Can you image if people
were aware of your

23:40.642 --> 23:43.642
private meetings
with that man?

23:43.676 --> 23:47.709
And there was no need to be so
rough with my lady-in-waiting.

23:47.742 --> 23:49.309
I want to make Kristina,

23:49.342 --> 23:51.609
the greatest Lutheran
sovereign in the world.

23:51.642 --> 23:55.509
And I work night and day
to have your reforms approved

23:55.542 --> 23:58.475
but there's
opposition from all sides.

23:58.509 --> 24:01.475
Your ideas are expensive,

24:01.509 --> 24:03.676
and peace doesn't
fill our coffers.

24:03.709 --> 24:07.642
I believe in your ideas,
but you must help me.

24:07.676 --> 24:11.676
Don't allow your
curiosity to distract you.

24:28.178 --> 24:29.878
They're love apples...

24:29.911 --> 24:31.778
Delicious!

24:31.811 --> 24:35.711
Descartes believes in
the proper use of our passions.

24:35.745 --> 24:36.711
Because he thinks,

24:36.745 --> 24:40.078
it is the source
of all felicity in our lives.

24:41.312 --> 24:43.811
Does that mean he rejects
the philosophy of the Stoics?

24:43.845 --> 24:46.312
Human passions
are bad for your soul?

24:46.345 --> 24:47.379
Absolutely...

24:47.412 --> 24:49.745
Then why should we learn
to recognize our feelings?

24:49.778 --> 24:55.578
Then we can decide what is right
and what is wrong for ourselves.

25:09.611 --> 25:11.778
But our lives are
determined in advance.

25:00.749 --> 25:06.382
When one does as one wishes,
one rarely does as one should.

25:19.483 --> 25:21.483
Should'd be studying the
catechism

25:21.483 --> 25:23.016
not the nature of the
feelings.

25:23.735 --> 25:27.535
I don't understand her
obsseion with that Descartes.

25:27.836 --> 25:30.016
Rome is worried about that.

25:30.337 --> 25:33.337
That Descartes will shake
her faith in Luther.

25:34.138 --> 25:36.338
¿Who will guide her to the Pope?

25:36.339 --> 25:37.329
Rene Descartes.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.430
I think it's a great risk.

26:10.678 --> 26:12.609
Monsieur Descartes,

26:12.651 --> 26:16.679
I've heard about your
research on human emotions...

26:18.555 --> 26:21.355
I would like you to
explain two things to me...

26:21.386 --> 26:22.307
Bonjour, oui?

26:22.348 --> 26:23.756
This is for Descartes.

26:23.854 --> 26:25.156
First...

26:27.013 --> 26:28.815
I would like you to tell me...

26:30.115 --> 26:31.716
What is love?

26:33.449 --> 26:36.282
I cannot grasp
the secret impulse,

26:36.315 --> 26:39.582
that draws us to one person
rather than another,

26:39.616 --> 26:43.716
Before we truly know
that person's worth.

26:46.849 --> 26:51.716
Does this hidden alliance
have its roots in the body...

26:53.182 --> 26:54.782
or the mind?

26:57.482 --> 26:59.415
And secondly,

27:00.649 --> 27:04.082
how does one
get rid of this feeling?

27:06.683 --> 27:07.783
Your Majesty...

27:08.284 --> 27:11.684
I'm very please for your interest
in my work.

27:11.749 --> 27:16.716
There are two kinds of love.

27:16.749 --> 27:18.716
Compassionate love...

27:18.749 --> 27:22.649
which makes us desire
the best for those we love.

27:24.349 --> 27:27.282
And lustful love.

27:27.315 --> 27:31.282
The love that makes us
desire those we love.

27:32.882 --> 27:36.549
Every passion
changes us physically,

27:36.582 --> 27:39.582
and each one
has its own symptoms.

27:40.449 --> 27:45.148
We can identify them
by the changes in our pulse,

27:45.682 --> 27:46.749
our breathing...

27:47.749 --> 27:50.215
or by the flush of our skin.

27:50.382 --> 27:54.182
But beware
of facial expressions.

27:55.382 --> 27:59.249
They do not always
reveal the truth since,

27:59.282 --> 28:03.716
we can willfully control
our facial expressions.

28:05.115 --> 28:09.749
To hide one passion,
we can imagine another,

28:09.782 --> 28:11.848
quite the opposite.

28:11.882 --> 28:17.082
But, for the time being,
you should love.

28:17.848 --> 28:21.148
You can reason afterwards.

28:27.449 --> 28:28.782
These are for me?

28:30.249 --> 28:31.415
Are you serious?

28:31.515 --> 28:33.349
It's a present from Johan.

28:33.382 --> 28:36.048
Is he serious?

28:37.716 --> 28:40.515
Perhaps you...

28:40.549 --> 28:43.449
neglected these things
for too long...

28:45.415 --> 28:48.415
The fff... feminine things
that please...

28:48.449 --> 28:50.549
Please who?

28:59.482 --> 29:01.482
This one is luminous.

29:01.515 --> 29:03.582
Yes, it's luminous.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.182
Yes.

29:11.349 --> 29:13.249
How luminous!

29:13.482 --> 29:14.815
Try it on.

29:16.215 --> 29:17.549
Me?

29:17.582 --> 29:19.649
I'm sure it will suit you.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.282
No!

29:30.449 --> 29:32.215
Here in front of me.

29:33.482 --> 29:35.716
In front of you?

29:35.748 --> 29:37.148
Yes.

29:53.616 --> 29:55.649
You're suddenly so quiet.

29:57.848 --> 30:01.148
I'm trying to change
my facial expression

30:01.182 --> 30:04.115
by thinking of something
totally different.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.215
Your fiancé?

30:10.882 --> 30:11.848
Jakob?

30:11.882 --> 30:14.048
How does he look at you?

30:15.649 --> 30:19.115
Sometimes he touches
his chest like you...

30:19.148 --> 30:20.649
right now.

30:23.681 --> 30:27.515
Then he places his hands
on his chin, like you.

30:31.282 --> 30:32.781
The gown.

30:37.848 --> 30:40.082
Is he proud
to have you on his arm?

30:43.182 --> 30:44.415
I think so.

30:44.449 --> 30:49.249
Does he know how many men envy
him in the jungle of suitors?

30:51.882 --> 30:55.515
Jakob looks at me the way
we look at white swans.

30:56.648 --> 31:01.582
We praise the beauty
of their wings, but...

31:04.681 --> 31:07.282
We forbid them to fly.

31:32.882 --> 31:35.082
How does he touch you?

31:43.182 --> 31:45.681
I love to make you blush.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.282
Did you have this
gown made for me?

31:54.182 --> 31:57.781
I knew you would like it.

32:06.882 --> 32:09.048
Tell me that you like them.

32:09.681 --> 32:10.748
They're lovely...

32:10.781 --> 32:12.482
I know more about...

32:12.515 --> 32:15.315
artillery
and cavalry strategies...

32:59.781 --> 33:03.082
Time for prayers, Your Majesty.

33:12.648 --> 33:17.581
Nature is devious,
when it comes to desire.

33:20.215 --> 33:23.249
We must not
let her have her way.

33:26.548 --> 33:33.615
Dear God, let discernment
and doubt be my guides.

33:37.514 --> 33:39.781
- Amen.
- Amen.

33:40.382 --> 33:43.182
By the way,
that gown was for you.

33:43.215 --> 33:45.215
I meant to tell you,
from now on,

33:45.249 --> 33:48.249
I will have a private audience
with whomever I please...

33:48.282 --> 33:51.382
- I don't think...
- And, whenever I please.

33:51.415 --> 33:53.615
Good night, Chancellor.

33:59.382 --> 34:00.648
I delivered your instructions

34:00.681 --> 34:03.148
for the expansion
of the Fallon mines.

34:03.182 --> 34:04.415
Thank you.

34:05.182 --> 34:07.148
Anything else?

34:08.648 --> 34:10.614
Johan is afraid that
an army that doesn't share

34:10.648 --> 34:14.447
our peaceful aspirations
is about to invade Prague.

34:14.481 --> 34:15.614
Prague?

34:15.648 --> 34:16.715
Yes.

34:16.748 --> 34:20.681
Isn't that where Emperor
Rudolph keeps his treasures?

34:20.715 --> 34:22.349
Yes.

34:23.181 --> 34:27.614
They say the treasures
include priceless rare books.

34:28.282 --> 34:33.581
The most beautiful
paintings of all time and...

34:33.614 --> 34:35.114
A collection of animals,

34:35.148 --> 34:38.748
never seen in this
part of the world before.

34:38.781 --> 34:41.148
- Yes.
- They also say...

34:42.748 --> 34:46.748
He has an unholy Bible.

34:46.781 --> 34:50.282
A Bible written
by the devil himself.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.681
Prague...

35:05.681 --> 35:08.249
Concentrate...

35:11.815 --> 35:13.815
Count Oxenstierna.

35:14.382 --> 35:15.581
Johan!

35:15.615 --> 35:17.349
Hey...

35:23.115 --> 35:25.115
I'm so happy to see you again.

35:25.148 --> 35:27.315
I'm glad to hear that.

35:32.581 --> 35:35.715
An official portrait, Countess.

35:35.748 --> 35:37.781
You're spoiled.

35:39.315 --> 35:41.082
Et voilà!

35:41.481 --> 35:44.115
The humanists
are here by the door.

35:44.349 --> 35:45.349
The stoics...

35:45.381 --> 35:46.748
by the windows.

35:47.514 --> 35:49.182
And...

35:49.215 --> 35:51.514
The library
of the humanist Grotius

35:51.548 --> 35:53.548
will arrive soon.

35:54.249 --> 35:54.915
Can you imagine!

35:54.948 --> 35:57.215
Forty-eight cartloads of books!

35:57.249 --> 36:00.481
150,000 manuscripts...

36:00.514 --> 36:05.381
This new library could hold
500,000 books and treatises.

36:05.414 --> 36:08.448
Nourishment for
our beloved Sweden.

36:08.481 --> 36:11.082
The most
beautiful garden of all.

36:12.282 --> 36:13.548
Did you really miss me...

36:13.581 --> 36:15.282
while I was away?

36:15.315 --> 36:19.348
I told Countess Sparre you are
the man who is dearest to me.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.414
Let me read to you...

36:25.748 --> 36:28.548
Not this one,
this one is in Greek.

36:32.448 --> 36:35.148
- And this one in...
- Arabic.

36:35.182 --> 36:36.781
Of course...

36:39.514 --> 36:41.514
And this one in Spanish.

36:44.048 --> 36:45.815
At last, here's one
in our language.

36:46.448 --> 36:48.182
I'm listening.

36:49.815 --> 36:54.648
The Elliptical Trajectory of the Planets
, by Kepler.

37:03.848 --> 37:04.748
Good Lord...

37:04.781 --> 37:07.348
An official portrait
for Countess Sparre

37:07.381 --> 37:09.082
in a whore's gown?

37:10.281 --> 37:12.414
It's the gown you sent
to Kristina as a present

37:12.448 --> 37:14.249
while you were away.

37:14.281 --> 37:17.215
I sent a gown?
To Kristina?

37:17.249 --> 37:18.548
Several gowns.

37:19.815 --> 37:21.082
For Kristina?

37:21.115 --> 37:22.548
18, to be honest.

37:23.715 --> 37:25.715
Why is the countess wearing it?

37:25.748 --> 37:27.748
I don't know ask her!

37:27.781 --> 37:29.681
Women...

37:32.781 --> 37:35.148
We have to maintain
total domination,

37:35.182 --> 37:37.681
over the Baltic Sea
at all costs.

37:37.715 --> 37:40.314
But I promised the Germans
we would leave them

37:40.348 --> 37:42.715
three provinces
with access to the shore!

37:42.748 --> 37:45.581
Emperor Marcus Aurelius said:

37:45.615 --> 37:48.681
"The world is in
perpetual transformation

37:48.715 --> 37:51.182
and life is a mere opinion."

37:51.215 --> 37:52.481
Translation, please?

37:52.514 --> 37:54.481
Nothing is unalterable.

37:54.514 --> 37:56.815
You intend to break the
promise I made to the Germans...

37:56.848 --> 37:59.281
The negotiations
are taking too long.

37:59.314 --> 38:03.514
We worked day and night to grant
them this access to the sea.

38:03.548 --> 38:06.648
I have ordered Karl Gustav
to enter Prague.

38:08.148 --> 38:09.481
We will conquer Prague?

38:10.414 --> 38:12.781
Before the peace negotiations
are over?

38:12.815 --> 38:15.082
The terror inspired
by the conquest of Prague

38:15.115 --> 38:18.414
will hasten the negotiations
to our advantage.

38:18.448 --> 38:24.248
"Ô, dieu qu'il est doux de
plaindre le sort d'un ennemi

38:24.281 --> 38:27.715
quand il n'est plus à craindre!"

38:29.481 --> 38:33.115
And that means:
An enemy on his knees

38:33.148 --> 38:35.648
has no choice but to negotiate.

38:35.681 --> 38:40.281
You intend to send
me back to Osnabruck,

38:40.314 --> 38:41.715
to break our promises?

38:41.748 --> 38:45.448
No, Johan, I intend
to keep you here with me.

38:47.115 --> 38:48.414
We will march on Prague!

38:48.448 --> 38:50.481
We will march on Prague!

38:51.381 --> 38:52.414
Axel?

38:55.214 --> 38:58.148
We will march on Prague!

39:03.514 --> 39:05.815
Why can't she talk
like the rest of us?

39:20.115 --> 39:22.648
Descartes is afraid he'll
be forced to flee Holland soon.

39:22.681 --> 39:24.248
He will always be welcome here.

39:24.281 --> 39:26.781
- Has he written to you recently?
- Well actually...

39:28.348 --> 39:29.648
He wrote...

39:30.348 --> 39:31.681
A treatise.

39:33.248 --> 39:35.214
And it is for you.

39:38.281 --> 39:40.448
Descartes hopes for
your Majesty's opinion.

39:40.481 --> 39:43.082
For me?
Les passions de l'âme.

39:43.115 --> 39:44.348
His latest work.

39:44.381 --> 39:47.681
He must come to Sweden
and teach me all this.

39:47.715 --> 39:51.281
I'll invite him,
on your behalf, your Majesty.

39:51.882 --> 39:53.414
You must.

39:53.448 --> 39:54.581
I will.

39:55.348 --> 39:56.114
Look...

39:57.114 --> 40:01.015
"To attain the truth in life,
we must discard all the ideas..."

40:04.848 --> 40:06.815
What a nice surprise.

40:07.615 --> 40:09.815
They're looking for you.

40:10.381 --> 40:11.548
Kristina?

40:11.581 --> 40:12.748
Oh...
Au revoir your majesty...

40:12.781 --> 40:14.147
Where are you?

40:14.181 --> 40:15.214
Come...

40:22.882 --> 40:24.381
He wrote to me...

40:26.214 --> 40:27.448
All this...

40:27.481 --> 40:30.348
"To attain the truth in life,
we must discard

40:30.381 --> 40:32.348
all the ideas
we've been taught..."

40:39.581 --> 40:42.514
"And reconstruct the entire
system of our knowledge."

40:49.348 --> 40:51.281
The queen is here!!!

40:51.314 --> 40:52.381
The Queen!

40:52.414 --> 40:54.481
The Queen!!

40:59.781 --> 41:02.815
What were you and
her majesty talking about?

41:02.848 --> 41:05.715
Chancellor, you cannot
deny my access to the Queen.

41:05.748 --> 41:09.481
You know France
is your greatest ally.

41:09.514 --> 41:11.414
We need your mines.

41:12.448 --> 41:13.748
You need our money.

41:13.915 --> 41:15.815
¡I won't allow that you
manipulate her.

41:15.815 --> 41:18.916
¡Even if I must declare the
war to the Pope!

41:35.548 --> 41:37.715
My valiant subjects!

41:37.748 --> 41:41.815
You work to ensure the glory
of Sweden and your queen.

41:41.850 --> 41:43.350
Offer them some beer.

41:44.480 --> 41:47.683
Thanks to your
fathers' rebellion,

41:47.710 --> 41:52.115
My ancestor rose to the throne
and overthrew tyranny...

41:52.147 --> 41:54.211
Offer them beer!

41:54.655 --> 41:56.556
As the great
Marcus Aurelius said...

41:56.584 --> 41:57.780
Beer for everyone!

42:02.315 --> 42:04.110
"Long live Kristina!"

42:04.153 --> 42:05.778
"Long live Kristina!"

42:05.815 --> 42:07.615
"Long live Kristina!"

42:07.648 --> 42:09.748
"Long live Kristina!..."

42:20.448 --> 42:24.581
"Desire is an agitation
caused by the spirits"

42:24.615 --> 42:29.248
which disposes the soul
to will for the future

42:29.281 --> 42:34.815
"things it represents
to itself as desirable."

42:34.848 --> 42:36.648
Are you feeling ill?

42:36.681 --> 42:37.615
No...

42:37.648 --> 42:39.314
Just a bit tired.

42:39.348 --> 42:40.648
Go get some rest.

42:40.681 --> 42:43.214
- No... I.
- Immediately.

43:01.248 --> 43:02.781
In the winter...

43:02.815 --> 43:05.581
during the military campaigns,

43:05.615 --> 43:09.514
my father asked a nobleman
to warm his bed for him.

43:09.548 --> 43:12.581
He lay in the bed
before my father,

43:12.615 --> 43:17.081
and the sheets were warm
when the king came to join him.

43:17.114 --> 43:20.147
They called him
the king's bed companion.

43:21.781 --> 43:25.081
From now on,
you will have this title.

43:28.414 --> 43:30.214
At the court?

43:30.248 --> 43:33.615
And you will
assume these duties.

44:13.147 --> 44:14.481
Belle?

44:16.481 --> 44:18.581
You may call
me that if you wish.

44:22.715 --> 44:25.581
I don't need your permission.

44:48.214 --> 44:49.814
I know how to set a bear trap,

44:49.847 --> 44:53.248
how.. how to cl..
Clean a musket, but...

44:53.281 --> 44:57.581
I don't know how
to place my lips on yours.

44:57.615 --> 45:00.615
What to do with my hands.

45:32.514 --> 45:34.514
That was better.

45:42.881 --> 45:46.381
What does your philosopher say?

45:46.414 --> 45:50.514
To attain the truth in life
we must discard

45:50.548 --> 45:54.047
all the ideas we've been taught.

46:39.881 --> 46:41.681
The queen says that...

46:41.714 --> 46:43.814
pregnant women
are nothing but sows.

46:45.281 --> 46:49.081
Our monarch is fluent
in many languages.

46:49.114 --> 46:52.581
I want to remain in her service.

46:52.615 --> 46:56.081
There is no better position
than that of a lady-in-waiting.

46:56.114 --> 46:58.514
None sire, none.

47:01.714 --> 47:04.615
There is only one way for
you to remain in her service.

47:04.648 --> 47:07.248
That is against God's will!

47:13.181 --> 47:16.780
Is fornicating
outside of wedlock,

47:16.814 --> 47:18.581
a Christian act?

47:20.648 --> 47:22.680
But I love him...

47:22.714 --> 47:24.248
Of course...

47:24.281 --> 47:28.248
Of course you do...

47:32.414 --> 47:36.281
I will see that they deal
with this thing in your belly.

47:44.348 --> 47:48.414
And you can be helpful to me,
Countess Erksein.

47:52.281 --> 47:53.780
So? What is it?

47:53.814 --> 47:56.747
Countess Sparre has
broken off her engagement

47:56.780 --> 47:58.814
with Jakob de la Gardie.

48:00.514 --> 48:01.814
Nobody told me.

48:01.847 --> 48:03.414
When Her Majesty is one's rival,

48:03.448 --> 48:06.114
one doesn't shout it
from the rooftops.

48:06.147 --> 48:08.248
What are you insinuating?

48:08.281 --> 48:11.680
The countess,
has just been promoted

48:11.714 --> 48:14.281
to the title of the
queen's bed companion.

48:14.314 --> 48:16.647
Johan, Johan, Johan!

48:17.714 --> 48:20.814
Friendship between
women is much closer

48:20.847 --> 48:22.314
than the friendship of men,

48:22.348 --> 48:24.314
and it can be
easily misinterpreted.

48:24.348 --> 48:25.748
When will you
stop kidding yourself,

48:25.780 --> 48:27.647
- my pathetic papa?
- Wait, stop!

48:27.680 --> 48:29.847
You raised her as a man

48:29.881 --> 48:32.680
and now you're surprised
that she whistles at women!

48:32.714 --> 48:35.747
Her determination to change
the natural order of things

48:35.780 --> 48:37.747
is from her deviance, father.

48:37.780 --> 48:40.780
Deviants they need to question
the natural order of things.

48:40.814 --> 48:42.614
They need to
make the world fit

48:42.647 --> 48:46.214
their peculiar vision
of the order of things.

48:46.248 --> 48:48.181
We must not exaggerate.

48:48.214 --> 48:52.481
How long will we stand by
while ladies adopt breeches

48:52.514 --> 48:54.814
and gentlemen become
eunuchs?

48:54.847 --> 48:58.814
We must not exaggerate
and stop drinking! Stop.

48:58.847 --> 49:00.514
The more scandalous
her behavior,

49:00.548 --> 49:02.281
the more people will blame you.

49:04.680 --> 49:09.248
I... I know someone who
will remind her of her duty.

49:21.414 --> 49:25.314
What is the purpose
of this rare visit, Mother?

49:25.348 --> 49:28.547
I want to travel to Germany
to see my family.

49:31.414 --> 49:32.481
Majesty...

49:32.514 --> 49:35.047
The purpose of your visit!

49:39.680 --> 49:40.680
You...

49:40.714 --> 49:44.747
You have to get married...
as soon as possible.

49:44.780 --> 49:46.780
For the stability of the throne.

49:47.680 --> 49:50.114
Think of the chaos
if you were to die tomorrow.

49:50.147 --> 49:52.348
I am aware of my duty
in this matter.

49:53.580 --> 49:58.114
But I have yet to accept...
that a man could exploit me

49:58.147 --> 50:00.780
like a peasant plows his fields.

50:01.780 --> 50:05.281
For the time being,
I have other concerns.

50:07.448 --> 50:09.147
I am working for peace.

50:09.181 --> 50:10.214
Peace?

50:11.381 --> 50:13.248
Peace yes...

50:14.580 --> 50:17.214
I've heard about this madness.

50:17.248 --> 50:19.348
Your father fought
for the conquests

50:19.381 --> 50:23.281
that you are pawning
for your silly whims!

50:25.947 --> 50:26.847
You were speaking
about marriage.

50:26.881 --> 50:30.181
There is no glory
in hypocritical treaties

50:30.214 --> 50:33.747
that do nothing but grant
the enemy time to rearm.

50:33.780 --> 50:38.248
- Peace is a gift to a nation.
- Words, words, words!

50:38.281 --> 50:40.214
Listen to the
Minerva of the North.

50:40.248 --> 50:43.480
She invades Prague in the middle
of the peace negotiations,

50:43.513 --> 50:46.214
and then she extends
the olive branch.

50:48.314 --> 50:51.214
Give your nation
an heir to the throne.

50:51.248 --> 50:53.780
That's the gift
you should be working for.

50:54.513 --> 50:56.847
We need strong arms!

50:56.881 --> 50:59.414
Not brains!

50:59.447 --> 51:03.714
Fill your subjects' bellies,
not their minds!

51:03.747 --> 51:09.181
You are the Queen of a nation
of filthy, primitive bears,

51:09.214 --> 51:12.181
and they must
recognize themselves in you.

51:13.881 --> 51:14.748
I had hoped

51:16.547 --> 51:20.747
to see something like purity,
something different!

51:19.881 --> 51:25.547
My father,
left you behind in his camp,

51:25.580 --> 51:29.547
and he went out
to visit his whores.

51:37.264 --> 51:39.430
Who would want you?

51:42.063 --> 51:44.497
If your father saw
what has become of you.

51:44.497 --> 51:47.200
I forbid you
to speak of my father.

51:47.200 --> 51:48.996
You forbid me?

51:49.730 --> 51:54.263
You made my father an object
of your grotesque grieving.

51:54.563 --> 51:57.030
An embalmed cadaver
that you forced me to kiss

51:57.030 --> 52:01.263
at sunrise and sunset,
every day, day after day,

52:01.263 --> 52:02.930
when I was six years old!

52:03.463 --> 52:07.497
You will never know
the power of such love!

52:07.830 --> 52:09.496
May God spare me!

52:16.330 --> 52:17.764
From my own belly...

52:18.397 --> 52:20.531
Instead of another
stillborn son,

52:21.664 --> 52:24.797
they handed me a dark daughter.

52:25.430 --> 52:26.096
Alive.

52:29.664 --> 52:31.231
After so many years apart...

52:34.697 --> 52:37.997
I will always,
love your father.

52:38.530 --> 52:42.397
You were a bottomless
pit of longing.

52:42.830 --> 52:48.230
He was only faithful to you during his
two years of putrefaction.

52:50.630 --> 52:52.363
This audience is over!

52:57.697 --> 52:59.864
All these years,
I had my regrets.

53:01.197 --> 53:02.697
I should have left you there...

53:03.830 --> 53:05.496
at the foot of the staircase!

53:17.496 --> 53:19.196
It was you!

53:56.580 --> 53:58.747
I forbid you to cry!

53:59.280 --> 54:01.814
This is my sorrow, not yours!

54:05.214 --> 54:07.081
How dare you!

54:08.181 --> 54:10.081
Don't think, Countess,

54:10.114 --> 54:11.780
that the moments
of distraction we shared

54:11.814 --> 54:14.280
give you the right
to behave like this.

54:15.881 --> 54:19.280
- I thought...
- What did you think?

54:19.313 --> 54:22.647
The company of women
is distracting me from my duty.

54:28.214 --> 54:29.847
Monsieur Descartes...

54:29.881 --> 54:32.380
I would like you to tell me,

54:32.413 --> 54:35.214
between love, and hatred,

54:36.580 --> 54:40.413
which of those two
creates the worst disorders?

54:43.181 --> 54:47.647
Like love,
there are two kinds of hatred.

54:47.680 --> 54:50.647
The feeling we simply call...

54:50.680 --> 54:51.847
hatred...

54:51.881 --> 54:56.047
which is related to things
that are bad for the soul.

54:56.714 --> 55:00.847
The other is the feeling
called, horreur!

55:00.881 --> 55:05.181
Which is related to things
that are ugly for the soul.

55:11.114 --> 55:13.347
Then I hate my mother...

55:16.313 --> 55:18.647
who has a horror of me.

55:39.780 --> 55:43.147
I've waited too long for you.

55:43.347 --> 55:45.680
And by Christ's balls!

55:45.714 --> 55:48.580
I don't like to be kept waiting!

55:48.614 --> 55:50.447
By who's...?

55:53.881 --> 55:56.347
Welcome Monsieur Descartes.

56:09.680 --> 56:11.213
It's about time!

56:11.247 --> 56:12.347
Down with Rome!

56:12.380 --> 56:13.213
Down with Rome!

56:13.247 --> 56:15.081
- Death to the Catholics.
- Down with Rome!

56:15.114 --> 56:16.714
Burn the Pope at the stake!

56:17.313 --> 56:18.714
Monsieur Descartes,

56:20.213 --> 56:23.647
show us the discovery
that is the talk of Europe.

56:23.680 --> 56:25.347
Your majesty...

56:25.380 --> 56:28.180
I was not expecting this.

56:28.213 --> 56:30.413
At the dawn of an era of peace,

56:30.447 --> 56:33.213
cadavers will become
a rare commodity.

56:33.247 --> 56:37.313
You must put this
to good use monsieur.

57:05.146 --> 57:06.647
The saw, please.

57:12.380 --> 57:17.280
In the course of my,
anatomical investigations...

57:17.480 --> 57:20.547
I recently discovered...

57:21.480 --> 57:23.547
a tiny gland,

57:23.580 --> 57:26.180
no bigger than a pine nut,

57:26.213 --> 57:31.280
that is the meeting place,
of body and mind.

57:33.380 --> 57:36.113
I am convinced,

57:36.146 --> 57:41.714
this, is where
our emotions are born.

57:41.747 --> 57:43.580
Hammer please.

57:55.213 --> 58:00.513
This gland is situated just
below the Sylvian fissure.

58:01.847 --> 58:07.380
Which channels
the animal spirits.

58:10.380 --> 58:13.447
The blood that
flows from this fissure...

58:14.814 --> 58:21.347
touches this gland,
triggering the passions we feel.

58:22.447 --> 58:24.280
Tweezers, please.

58:30.247 --> 58:37.213
Your Majesty,
allow me to introduce,

58:37.247 --> 58:42.580
the pineal gland,
"the seat of the soul!"

58:45.447 --> 58:50.480
To understand, the workings,
we may one day,

58:50.513 --> 58:57.247
be able,
to control our passions...

58:57.280 --> 58:59.814
- physically!
- Then what?

58:59.847 --> 59:01.814
Remove a piece of hatred?

59:01.847 --> 59:03.480
A slice of desire?

59:06.380 --> 59:08.180
Who knows?

59:08.213 --> 59:09.580
Who's to say?

59:09.614 --> 59:11.680
Remove the longing?

59:11.714 --> 59:14.447
The endless waiting?

59:14.480 --> 59:16.714
Remove the voice that haunt us.

59:16.747 --> 59:20.347
The soul is in God's hands!
Not in a pine nut!

59:20.380 --> 59:21.714
Heresy!

59:35.547 --> 59:38.280
I hope, Monsieur Descartes,
that you will forgive

59:38.313 --> 59:40.146
the lack of manners in my court.

59:40.180 --> 59:41.413
Kristina...

59:41.447 --> 59:42.680
Kristina!

59:44.247 --> 59:45.380
You have gone too far.

59:45.413 --> 59:49.180
Didn't you teach me, that
curiosity is a great virtue?

59:49.213 --> 59:50.714
In Luther's teachings!

59:50.747 --> 59:53.247
By God's ass!

59:53.280 --> 59:55.814
Luther has no
curiosity whatsoever!

59:55.847 --> 59:57.680
That's blasphemy against Luther.

01:00:01.213 --> 01:00:03.714
We cannot accept this heresy...

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.213
Your Majesty!

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.347
I curse you, I curse you.
May you burn in Hell!

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.347
My little girl...

01:00:52.413 --> 01:00:53.513
Johan...

01:00:53.547 --> 01:00:55.747
He has saved your life.

01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:00.347
I better leave you alone.

01:01:11.146 --> 01:01:15.280
The man is a fanatic
from the theology school.

01:01:15.313 --> 01:01:17.846
I pushed you out of the way.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.513
You hit your head.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.614
Belle?

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.714
Come to me...

01:01:37.747 --> 01:01:39.747
Come close to me...

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.647
Come to me..

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.213
I thought I lost you...

01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:46.146
I'm so sorry...

01:01:48.846 --> 01:01:51.046
Will you forgive me?

01:01:56.347 --> 01:01:57.813
She must marry.

01:01:57.846 --> 01:01:59.247
She must fornicate.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.747
If she dies in childbirth,
at least

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.813
she will have tried
to embrace her destiny.

01:02:03.846 --> 01:02:08.380
How dare you speak about
our sovereign like that?

01:02:08.413 --> 01:02:10.846
The Council can
remove her from office,

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.447
on the grounds of
extraordinary circumstances.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.779
Can you imagine the
turmoil that would ensue?

01:02:18.813 --> 01:02:20.547
Turmoil?

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.480
And what about the songs

01:02:21.513 --> 01:02:23.813
that are becoming
more and more popular?

01:02:23.846 --> 01:02:26.547
- Are there songs...
- I've heard reports,

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.347
of the ribald songs

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.213
they're singing in taverns
around the countryside

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:32.580
and even in Stockholm.

01:02:32.614 --> 01:02:34.146
So sing it!

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.380
? While the lads are studying
the art of seduction, ?

01:02:41.413 --> 01:02:44.846
? The ladies need
no introduction! ?

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.746
? Lads hoping
to win a lady's heart, ?

01:02:49.779 --> 01:02:54.280
? Turn to Kristina,
grand master of this art! ?

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:56.180
? Turn to Kristina!

01:02:56.213 --> 01:03:00.614
? Grand Master of this art!

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.280
You are not meant

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:07.547
to live within the
confines of Luther's faith.

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.614
Look around you!

01:03:08.647 --> 01:03:11.680
Eveybody at the court
wants you to be pregnant,

01:03:11.713 --> 01:03:14.746
under the thumb
of male authority.

01:03:15.813 --> 01:03:17.247
Rome has become today

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.280
a center where
everything is possible.

01:03:20.313 --> 01:03:23.113
St. Peter's Basilica has
created a effervescence.

01:03:23.146 --> 01:03:26.113
It's a gathering place
for the finest minds and,

01:03:26.146 --> 01:03:30.447
- the most, daring artists.
- Get to the point.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.113
Rome...

01:03:32.146 --> 01:03:34.380
needs a queen.

01:03:34.413 --> 01:03:36.779
Rome has a pope.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.713
Rome needs a virgin queen.

01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:50.146
Your faith is based on
indulgences and relics.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.813
Buy a piece of Christ's cross

01:03:51.846 --> 01:03:55.213
and one is assured of
a hundred years in heaven.

01:03:56.813 --> 01:03:58.746
There are so many pieces

01:03:58.779 --> 01:04:01.813
of the Christ child's foreskin
in circulation,

01:04:01.846 --> 01:04:05.113
I can't imagine the size
of the Holy member.

01:04:06.347 --> 01:04:09.779
Faith can be purchased
in your church.

01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:13.413
That church is preparing
to offer you freedom.

01:04:13.447 --> 01:04:16.846
The Pope wants
to tend all your needs,

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.413
the most reasonable
and the most unreasonable.

01:04:24.513 --> 01:04:27.113
Please leave, monsieur.

01:04:27.146 --> 01:04:30.614
You will be free
to do whatever you want.

01:04:30.646 --> 01:04:32.614
In public and...

01:04:34.113 --> 01:04:34.846
in private.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.447
Please leave.

01:04:38.413 --> 01:04:40.247
Your Majesty.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.746
Descartes, you stay.

01:04:54.713 --> 01:04:58.480
I had to flee France
because I questioned,

01:04:58.513 --> 01:05:02.779
the real presence of Christ
in the communion host.

01:05:03.313 --> 01:05:05.613
I had to flee Holland,
because I glimpsed;

01:05:05.646 --> 01:05:10.313
It is the earth,
that gravitates around the sun.

01:05:12.247 --> 01:05:16.779
I'm convinced we can
determine our destiny.

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:20.113
But I am free, Your Majesty.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:25.280
I do not have
a kingdom to govern.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.513
Twenty-five states
and principalities...

01:05:53.546 --> 01:05:56.679
have signed,
the Westphalia treaty!

01:05:56.713 --> 01:05:58.779
Glory to you, your Majesty!

01:06:00.113 --> 01:06:01.646
From now on, every monarch

01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:04.380
can choose
the religion in his state.

01:06:06.447 --> 01:06:09.313
May you use this
disposition wisely.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.347
Long live Kristina!

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.512
Long live Kristina!

01:06:51.546 --> 01:06:53.713
Long live Kristina!

01:06:53.746 --> 01:06:56.146
Long live Kristina!

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.380
Long live Kristina!

01:06:57.413 --> 01:07:00.080
Long live Kristina!

01:07:01.913 --> 01:07:03.479
Hurray!

01:07:19.846 --> 01:07:21.380
Soldiers!

01:07:22.713 --> 01:07:24.213
Hey!

01:07:24.646 --> 01:07:26.779
- Friends!
- Hey!

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:31.080
My brothers-in-arms!

01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:36.646
As promised...

01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:40.347
we've brought
our beloved queen...

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.313
some presents!

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.213
The symbol,
of her almighty power...

01:07:55.846 --> 01:07:56.813
A lioness!

01:08:00.846 --> 01:08:02.380
For our Queen...

01:08:04.846 --> 01:08:06.512
But...

01:08:07.479 --> 01:08:11.213
What is this
majestic female missing?

01:08:11.247 --> 01:08:12.412
Lion!

01:08:12.446 --> 01:08:14.180
Lion!

01:08:14.213 --> 01:08:15.113
Lion!

01:08:15.146 --> 01:08:15.679
Yes!

01:08:15.713 --> 01:08:17.346
A king!

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:18.412
Karl Gustav!

01:08:18.446 --> 01:08:20.180
Karl Gustav!

01:08:20.212 --> 01:08:21.746
Karl Gustav!

01:08:23.645 --> 01:08:25.479
Where is our Queen?

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.578
Only God knows where she is.

01:08:54.113 --> 01:08:55.712
The Happy Life.

01:08:56.412 --> 01:08:57.645
Seneca.

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:02.746
Treatise on Pleasure.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:13.412
The Emperor of Prague

01:09:13.446 --> 01:09:16.645
was fascinated
by the occult sciences.

01:09:18.746 --> 01:09:22.511
This book was written
in a single night,

01:09:22.546 --> 01:09:26.279
by a monk who was walled in
for a grievous crime.

01:09:28.679 --> 01:09:33.479
And although he was in chains,
he managed to write this book...

01:09:33.511 --> 01:09:35.180
How?

01:09:38.412 --> 01:09:41.145
He recruited
the help of the devil.

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:45.313
Once the book was finished,
out of gratitude...

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:49.312
The monk surreptitiously
slipped his assistant's portrait

01:09:49.345 --> 01:09:50.479
into the volume.

01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:52.779
It's the Codex Gigas!

01:09:56.247 --> 01:09:58.746
They call it the Devil's Bible.

01:10:02.312 --> 01:10:03.446
Strange...

01:10:06.646 --> 01:10:09.280
He doesn't have
the wings of a fly.

01:10:09.312 --> 01:10:10.646
Close that book!

01:10:45.546 --> 01:10:47.080
Kristina?

01:10:48.512 --> 01:10:50.512
- Kristina!
- It's the Devil!

01:10:58.613 --> 01:11:00.180
Every blow...

01:11:00.279 --> 01:11:02.213
every blade that wounded...

01:11:02.246 --> 01:11:04.146
every charge on horseback...

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.146
Every move I made
bore your name!

01:11:06.613 --> 01:11:08.379
I brought you the treasure.

01:11:08.412 --> 01:11:09.346
I brought you the devil!

01:11:09.379 --> 01:11:11.080
Let go of her!

01:11:11.113 --> 01:11:12.346
You're going to marry me!

01:11:12.379 --> 01:11:13.713
- You're going to marry me!
- Let go of her!

01:11:13.746 --> 01:11:15.080
Let go of her!

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:23.579
STOP!!!

01:11:27.779 --> 01:11:29.512
Forget her!

01:11:32.312 --> 01:11:33.646
Every blow!

01:11:33.679 --> 01:11:35.279
Every blade!

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.180
Let the Queen to get her
passion.

01:11:40.181 --> 01:11:42.681
Her weakness helps us.

01:11:44.182 --> 01:11:47.782
There is nothing catholic
in that weakness.

01:11:47.782 --> 01:11:49.583
It's just a bare matter
of scruple.

01:11:49.984 --> 01:11:53.384
¿But what are they with what
we offer her?

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:55.985
She must get rid by herself
of that passion,

01:11:56.886 --> 01:11:59.486
which, in spite of its
appearances,

01:11:59.486 --> 01:12:02.187
can be harmful.

01:12:04.188 --> 01:12:06.988
The work of a monarch can
be complex.

01:12:07.989 --> 01:12:11.289
A complex mechanism based on
inexcapable divine rules.

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:20.290
Y the first one is that must
serve its people.

01:12:21.991 --> 01:12:26.991
Its the wheel that actives all
the mechanism,

01:12:27.592 --> 01:12:29.302
even all its wheels.

01:12:30.703 --> 01:12:32.903
If for personal reasons,

01:12:34.404 --> 01:12:38.304
it does not go in the right
direction...

01:12:40.405 --> 01:12:42.005
all the mechanism

01:12:43.806 --> 01:12:45.006
come down.

01:12:45.607 --> 01:12:46.907
Dime, amigo mío,

01:12:47.518 --> 01:12:49.408
¿what do we have to understand
here?

01:12:50.919 --> 01:12:54.609
The duty of the Queen is her
country, your Excellence.

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:03.410
The rest, father, is just
conspiration.

01:13:21.446 --> 01:13:22.646
Belle?

01:13:38.379 --> 01:13:40.112
Belle!

01:13:40.145 --> 01:13:41.479
Is that you?

01:13:42.179 --> 01:13:42.713
No.

01:13:42.746 --> 01:13:45.379
It's me, your majesty.

01:13:45.412 --> 01:13:47.679
The countess was
called away suddenly.

01:13:47.713 --> 01:13:50.312
Someone in her family is dying.

01:13:50.346 --> 01:13:52.346
- Who?
- I don't know.

01:13:52.379 --> 01:13:54.579
They just told me
someone in her family.

01:14:03.579 --> 01:14:07.746
She left without my permission.

01:14:40.546 --> 01:14:42.512
In vitam eternam.

01:15:21.779 --> 01:15:24.779
She has been gone for days.

01:15:41.713 --> 01:15:44.045
You need to eat something...

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.646
Kristina...

01:15:52.346 --> 01:15:53.579
I want her...

01:16:21.379 --> 01:16:24.045
I know it was you.

01:16:50.179 --> 01:16:51.412
Oh my God...

01:16:51.446 --> 01:16:53.613
My clothes were burning.

01:16:53.646 --> 01:16:55.479
Everything was on fire.

01:16:57.579 --> 01:16:58.813
She was looking at me

01:16:58.846 --> 01:17:01.446
with the eyes of someone
who knows everything.

01:17:05.613 --> 01:17:07.479
Aye...

01:17:07.512 --> 01:17:09.212
Son...

01:17:55.746 --> 01:17:57.746
Your majesty!

01:18:06.646 --> 01:18:08.479
Your Majesty...

01:18:09.579 --> 01:18:11.579
Your Majesty, wake up!

01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:16.179
Your Majesty!

01:18:16.212 --> 01:18:17.679
Belle?

01:18:21.412 --> 01:18:23.312
Are you alright?

01:18:25.746 --> 01:18:28.246
I've never felt better.

01:18:39.179 --> 01:18:40.779
Ever since my father died,

01:18:40.812 --> 01:18:43.279
I've never missed
anyone so badly.

01:18:45.112 --> 01:18:46.778
Someone is coming.

01:18:47.412 --> 01:18:49.346
Someone is coming!

01:19:04.145 --> 01:19:05.479
Madam...

01:19:07.746 --> 01:19:11.112
Your must remember
Jakob, Count de la Gardie.

01:19:11.145 --> 01:19:12.279
Of course.

01:19:13.446 --> 01:19:15.679
Your Majesty,

01:19:15.713 --> 01:19:19.246
I know how dear
Countess Sparre is to you,

01:19:19.279 --> 01:19:21.745
and that is why I am
asking you to bless our union.

01:19:25.446 --> 01:19:27.812
I want to marry
Count de la Gardie.

01:19:37.579 --> 01:19:39.579
That is your deepest wish?

01:19:41.312 --> 01:19:42.446
Yes.

01:19:44.812 --> 01:19:46.346
You love each other?

01:19:48.312 --> 01:19:49.679
Yes.

01:19:58.279 --> 01:20:01.212
It would be inappropriate
for the goddess of peace

01:20:01.246 --> 01:20:03.212
not to bless their union.

01:20:11.579 --> 01:20:14.112
I wish you all
the happiness in the world.

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:21.246
Will your generosity extend
to attend our wedding?

01:20:24.312 --> 01:20:28.546
This excursion
has exhausted me!

01:20:33.145 --> 01:20:35.246
The queen blessed our union!

01:21:01.212 --> 01:21:03.446
Open the door!

01:21:03.479 --> 01:21:05.645
Please open the door!

01:21:06.145 --> 01:21:07.212
Let me explain!

01:21:07.246 --> 01:21:09.479
They made me understand.

01:21:10.246 --> 01:21:13.079
You are the shepherd
of our nation!

01:21:14.645 --> 01:21:16.778
It wasn't right.

01:21:17.246 --> 01:21:20.279
It was all wrong, very wrong.

01:21:20.546 --> 01:21:23.546
You are my sovereign,
I had to love you...

01:21:32.112 --> 01:21:34.312
She doesn't want to see you.

01:22:32.678 --> 01:22:34.512
His blood is yellow...

01:22:35.678 --> 01:22:39.179
This is not a case
of pneumonia, it's arsenic.

01:22:40.678 --> 01:22:41.612
Any other diagnosis

01:22:41.645 --> 01:22:45.112
would be harmful
to both my church and yours.

01:23:00.112 --> 01:23:02.812
Petite, petite...

01:23:05.812 --> 01:23:07.479
Oh my friend...

01:24:42.212 --> 01:24:43.379
Madam...

01:24:58.612 --> 01:25:00.145
Madam...

01:25:07.246 --> 01:25:12.445
Count Jakob Kazimir
de la Gardie, do you take,

01:25:12.478 --> 01:25:17.079
Countess Ebba Sparre,
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:18.112
Of course he does!

01:25:19.312 --> 01:25:20.378
I do.

01:25:20.845 --> 01:25:25.045
Countess Ebba Sparre,
do you take...

01:25:26.478 --> 01:25:30.312
do you take Count
Jakob Kazimir de la Gardie

01:25:30.346 --> 01:25:32.612
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

01:25:43.378 --> 01:25:45.845
Our Queen has found
a new tailor I see...

01:25:45.879 --> 01:25:47.511
Shut your mouth.

01:25:47.545 --> 01:25:50.346
Am I not the
shepherd of the nation?

01:25:52.845 --> 01:25:54.179
Carry on!

01:25:54.712 --> 01:25:56.411
Pretend I'm not here.

01:25:57.645 --> 01:26:02.545
If anyone for any reason,
objects to this marriage,

01:26:02.578 --> 01:26:05.411
let him or her
step forward now,

01:26:05.445 --> 01:26:07.345
or forever hold their peace.

01:26:08.879 --> 01:26:10.246
Look at them...

01:26:12.145 --> 01:26:14.312
Look at their beauty!

01:26:14.345 --> 01:26:15.445
Look!

01:26:20.312 --> 01:26:24.778
Who would dare
object to the obvious?

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:58.645
No!!

01:27:10.578 --> 01:27:12.378
Madam...

01:27:12.411 --> 01:27:13.511
Madam...

01:27:14.645 --> 01:27:16.212
Come with me...

01:27:16.478 --> 01:27:20.745
Please, let me take
you at your bed...

01:27:25.678 --> 01:27:27.145
Ejusdem farinae.

01:27:27.179 --> 01:27:28.478
Made of the same flour.

01:27:28.511 --> 01:27:30.612
Cut from the same cloth.

01:27:50.311 --> 01:27:51.745
Kristina! Stop!

01:28:11.346 --> 01:28:15.006
You will renounce the faith of
your father in Brussels.

01:28:15.807 --> 01:28:18.707
You will denounce Luther as
an heretic.

01:28:19.608 --> 01:28:23.008
You will be christened as
catholic in Innsbruck.

01:28:23.509 --> 01:28:26.909
The Pope will receive you at the Vatican,
in Saint Peter Plaza,

01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:29.600
before all the nobles in Rome.

01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:34.001
The Pope will confirm you in
the catholic faith.

01:28:33.999 --> 01:28:36.902
Your entrance in the Catholic
Church,

01:28:36.902 --> 01:28:40.503
will be the greatest victory in
this century for the catholics,

01:28:41.104 --> 01:28:44.117
obtained without any drop
of blood.

01:28:44.117 --> 01:28:46.505
You will be proclaim the
Virgin Queen.

01:28:46.606 --> 01:28:49.806
For the greatest glory of
God.

01:28:52.745 --> 01:28:55.045
Must I renounce my...

01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:57.578
country?

01:28:59.545 --> 01:29:01.578
Renounce my faith?

01:29:03.511 --> 01:29:05.311
My father?

01:29:07.411 --> 01:29:08.778
My people?

01:29:18.545 --> 01:29:23.178
Renounce everything I am
to be what I want to be?

01:29:30.445 --> 01:29:34.812
If the rumor of your intentions,
to convert to another religion

01:29:34.845 --> 01:29:37.712
is true,
I cannot support this.

01:29:37.745 --> 01:29:41.278
Luther never
fulfilled my aspirations.

01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:46.712
Luther doesn't exist to
fulfill anyone's, aspirations.

01:29:54.378 --> 01:29:57.045
If you choose, to convert...

01:29:59.545 --> 01:30:02.612
Some subjects will follow you,
but you must realize,

01:30:02.645 --> 01:30:08.511
that the majority will remain,
loyal to your father's faith.

01:30:08.845 --> 01:30:13.411
And inevitably some will
take advantage of these...

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:20.345
troubled times to promote
their own interests.

01:30:21.578 --> 01:30:24.645
And that is what
we call a civil war.

01:30:26.144 --> 01:30:27.378
But history will call it

01:30:27.411 --> 01:30:31.678
the downfall,
of the Swedish empire.

01:30:33.411 --> 01:30:35.345
And your enemies...

01:30:36.445 --> 01:30:40.411
will wipe their feet
on your peace treaty.

01:30:41.612 --> 01:30:44.144
And when that day comes,

01:30:44.879 --> 01:30:49.411
I'll curse the day
I called you my daughter!

01:30:55.812 --> 01:30:57.311
Kristina...

01:30:59.345 --> 01:31:02.378
My Kristina of Sweden...

01:31:03.812 --> 01:31:09.578
I implore you
to call upon your cleverness,

01:31:10.311 --> 01:31:14.812
I beseech you,
in the name of our Lord,

01:31:15.545 --> 01:31:17.712
save your empire!

01:31:39.645 --> 01:31:40.678
What?

01:31:40.778 --> 01:31:42.612
In God's name!

01:31:51.745 --> 01:31:53.578
You should
take off a few layers.

01:31:53.612 --> 01:31:55.745
Given your accoutrement...

01:31:56.578 --> 01:31:59.245
I prefer to wear my armor.

01:32:03.378 --> 01:32:04.845
If you've...

01:32:04.879 --> 01:32:09.378
If you've come to ask me
if I still love you, I do.

01:32:09.411 --> 01:32:10.712
I know.

01:32:12.178 --> 01:32:14.745
And I know that you
are the finest of men, Karl.

01:32:17.278 --> 01:32:19.645
You brought me
the greatest of treasures.

01:32:19.678 --> 01:32:21.345
You brought me the devil.

01:32:22.378 --> 01:32:23.778
You kept all your promises.

01:32:27.278 --> 01:32:30.278
I have come
to make you my king.

01:32:34.345 --> 01:32:35.712
Your king?

01:32:39.144 --> 01:32:40.445
Karl Gustav...

01:32:41.712 --> 01:32:44.378
The time has come
for you to give me

01:32:44.411 --> 01:32:46.545
the ultimate proof of your love.

01:32:48.645 --> 01:32:49.778
Gentlemen...

01:32:49.812 --> 01:32:53.812
Ever since I inherited
my father's crown,

01:32:53.845 --> 01:32:57.845
before I was old enough to
understand matters of state,

01:32:57.879 --> 01:33:01.511
You have constantly demanded
that I choose a king

01:33:01.545 --> 01:33:04.144
to share the throne
of our kingdom.

01:33:04.411 --> 01:33:08.311
I cannot blame your patriotic
sentiment to prevent the turmoil

01:33:08.345 --> 01:33:13.278
which would inevitably arise if,
by an act of his divine will,

01:33:13.311 --> 01:33:17.311
God were to take my life
before I had a designated heir.

01:33:17.879 --> 01:33:22.278
I have therefore decided, for
the security of our empire,

01:33:22.311 --> 01:33:26.511
to name my first cousin,
Karl Gustav...

01:33:27.478 --> 01:33:29.078
my son.

01:33:30.178 --> 01:33:31.612
Her what?

01:33:31.645 --> 01:33:32.712
Her son.

01:33:32.745 --> 01:33:35.612
And in so doing
I become his mother,

01:33:35.645 --> 01:33:38.178
and so I designate him

01:33:38.211 --> 01:33:43.411
the prince heir,
to the throne, of Sweden.

01:33:50.378 --> 01:33:53.645
She made him... her son...

01:33:56.411 --> 01:33:59.445
She made him her son.

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:46.311
I have come to bid you farewell.

01:34:46.812 --> 01:34:49.211
My faithful Erika.

01:34:49.511 --> 01:34:51.378
Your servant, Madam.

01:34:51.478 --> 01:34:53.378
Simply your servant.

01:34:58.111 --> 01:35:00.612
Do you think my father
would forgive me?

01:35:04.811 --> 01:35:07.712
I don't know
if forgiveness exists.

01:35:07.745 --> 01:35:09.445
I don't know, Madam.

01:35:35.211 --> 01:35:37.612
A great success, father!

01:35:37.645 --> 01:35:41.345
She's leaving with
a quarter of Sweden's wealth.

01:35:41.445 --> 01:35:43.511
Ten years on the throne,

01:35:43.545 --> 01:35:47.511
Ten years of... whims.

01:35:48.178 --> 01:35:51.245
She said she never wanted
to submit herself to a man

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:52.612
now she's off to kiss the ring

01:35:52.645 --> 01:35:54.744
of the most
powerful man of all.

01:35:56.178 --> 01:35:57.511
The Pope!

01:36:00.678 --> 01:36:04.078
A great success, father!

01:36:05.811 --> 01:36:08.311
I hope the Pope
enjoys her company.

01:36:09.378 --> 01:36:10.811
She's only 28 years old.

01:36:10.844 --> 01:36:12.811
She has her whole life
ahead of her,

01:36:12.844 --> 01:36:15.744
enough time to put the rest
of Christianity through hell.

01:36:18.578 --> 01:36:20.178
I saved Sweden.

01:36:21.545 --> 01:36:23.744
I saved Sweden?

01:36:38.245 --> 01:36:39.645
Madam!

01:38:30.711 --> 01:38:33.378
To attain the truth in life...

01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:39.445
We must discard
all the ideas we were taught

01:38:39.478 --> 01:38:46.545
and reconstruct the entire
system of our knowledge.
