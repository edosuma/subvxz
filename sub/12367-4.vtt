-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.836 --> 00:05.714
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.797 --> 00:07.549
- WHERE DO I BEGIN?

00:07.632 --> 00:09.426
MY BUSINESS IS IN SHAMBLES.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.594
I'M ABOUT TO BE DEPORTED.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.138
MY FAKE FIANCE DUMPED ME,

00:13.221 --> 00:15.598
SO I CAN'T EVEN KEEP A PHONY
RELATIONSHIP GOING.

00:15.682 --> 00:20.061
OH, AND YESTERDAY,
I LOST A TOOTH.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.896
NO WARNING.
JUST SNEEZED.

00:21.980 --> 00:22.772
MY UPPER-RIGHT MOLAR
FLEW OUT,

00:22.856 --> 00:25.817
LANDED IN MY PURSE.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.445
SO...BE HONEST.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.613
DO YOU THINK I'M PROJECTING
FEELINGS OF INSECURITY

00:30.697 --> 00:32.782
BECAUSE I'M CLINICALLY
CODEPENDENT?

00:32.866 --> 00:35.493
- I THINK THIS WORKS BETTER
IF YOU COME CLOSER

00:35.577 --> 00:39.456
TO THE CRYSTAL BALL.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.750
- NO OFFENSE,
BUT I CAN'T STARE

00:41.833 --> 00:43.835
AT THAT RIDICULOUS BALL.

00:43.918 --> 00:47.005
- NO PROBLEM.
WE GO OFF THE BALL.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.799
NOW, I GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO HELP,

00:49.883 --> 00:53.094
BUT YOU HAVE
TO KEEP OPEN MIND.

00:53.178 --> 00:56.639
THEY ARE SPANX.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.058
- SPANX?

00:59.142 --> 01:02.061
I'M CONFUSED,
NOT TO MENTION OFFENDED.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.147
- THESE NOT ORDINARY SPANX.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.025
MAGIC SPANX.

01:07.108 --> 01:11.029
THEY SHAPE AND CONTROL
THE FUTURE.

01:11.112 --> 01:14.449
- RIGHT.
MAGIC SPANX.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.992
DO YOU VALIDATE PARKING?

01:16.075 --> 01:18.620
BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO GET
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.455
[cell phone rings]

01:24.834 --> 01:26.503
"CUTE OLIVER."

01:26.586 --> 01:27.879
"CUTE OLIVER"?

01:27.962 --> 01:29.506
OH, MY GOD.
CUTE OLIVER.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.508
THE GUY I MET AT THE MARKET
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.969
- SPANX IS WORKING.

01:35.053 --> 01:38.139
- HELLO.
YES, THIS IS JOY.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.033
- $300 FOR A PAIR OF SPANX?

01:57.116 --> 01:59.911
- I'LL SAVE THEM
FOR THE NEXT CUSTOMER.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.871
- DO PSYCHICS TAKE CREDIT CARDS?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.249
- ANYTHING BUT DISCOVER.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.173
- THESE THINGS HAVE BROUGHT US
NOTHING BUT MISERY.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.550
I SAY WE BURN THEM.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.884
- OOH, I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU THINK IT'S LEGAL?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.386
YOU CAN'T BURN LEAVES ANYMORE.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.929
- OH, PLEASE.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.347
YOU CAN BURN ANYTHING.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.892
I ONCE SET FIRE
TO RYAN O'NEAL'S PORSCHE.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.395

WERE PRETTY BUMMED
ON THE BUS RIDE HOME, HUH?

- THERE WERE MORE BALLED-UP
TISSUES ON THAT FLOOR

BEDROOM.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.091
- ELKA!

02:55.174 --> 02:56.467

'CAUSE THEY WANT IT SO BAD AND
THEY'RE JUST NOT GETTING ANY.

TO BE A FAN,

HOW TO USE GOOGLE IMAGES.

03:20.742 --> 03:24.120
SO WHAT ARE YOU
THREE BATS DOING

03:24.203 --> 03:27.457
FLAPPING AROUND THE FIREPLACE?

03:27.540 --> 03:29.626
- WE WERE ABOUT
TO SET THESE ABLAZE.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.420
- YOU'RE BURNING A GIRDLE?

03:32.503 --> 03:34.088
- IT'S NOT A GIRDLE.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.299
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE A GIRDLE.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.343
- NO, IT'S SPANX.
IT'S A SHAPER.

03:38.426 --> 03:41.512
- SO IT'S A GIRDLE.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.973
- IT'S A COMPRESSION GARMENT
THAT MAKES A SMOOTH LINE

03:44.057 --> 03:44.974
UNDER YOUR CLOTHES.

- OH.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.562
OH, I HAVE A COMPRESSION GARMENT
LIKE THAT.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.564
IT'S CALLED A GIRDLE.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.787
{\an8}- SO WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BURN THE SPANX?

04:05.870 --> 04:07.497
{\an8}- I WAS SO DESPERATE
FOR ADVICE,

04:07.580 --> 04:09.666
{\an8}I WENT TO A PSYCHIC,
AND SHE SWORE

04:09.749 --> 04:11.793
{\an8}THESE WOULD BRING ME LUCK,
BUT THEY DIDN'T.

04:11.876 --> 04:15.964
{\an8}- WELL, OBVIOUSLY, THE ONLY
AUTHENTIC PSYCHICS ARE IN L.A.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.800
{\an8}- I KNOW IT'S SILLY,
BUT THE MOMENT I TOUCHED THESE,

04:18.882 --> 04:21.719
{\an8}THIS GUY I'D BEEN DYING
TO HEAR FROM SUDDENLY CALLED.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.472
{\an8}WE MADE A DATE,
I SLIPPED ON THE MAGIC SPANX,

04:24.555 --> 04:26.224
{\an8}AND I TRULY BELIEVED THINGS
WERE FINALLY

04:26.307 --> 04:28.184
{\an8}GOING TO TURN AROUND FOR ME.

04:28.267 --> 04:33.564
{\an8}- I LIKE WHERE THIS IS HEADING.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.441
{\an8}[doorbell rings]

04:38.444 --> 04:39.821
{\an8}- JOY?

04:39.904 --> 04:41.990
{\an8}- OLIVER.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.866
{\an8}WOW. A TUX.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.201
{\an8}AND I WAS WORRIED
I WAS OVERDRESSED.

04:45.284 --> 04:46.744
{\an8}- NO, YOU LOOK GREAT.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.205
{\an8}UM, PLEASE COME IN.

04:49.288 --> 04:53.084
{\an8}- I'M SO GLAD
THIS FINALLY HAPPENED.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.044
{\an8}- JOY, THIS IS AWKWARD.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.213
{\an8}I THINK ON THE DAY WE MET
AT THE MARKET,

04:57.296 --> 04:58.840
{\an8}I MET ANOTHER LADY,
A YOUNG LADY.

04:58.923 --> 05:02.218
{\an8}NOT THAT YOU'RE NOT YOUNG.

FOR A BABY-SITTER

05:03.594 --> 05:05.346
{\an8}FOR MY THREE-YEAR-OLD SON,
AND I THINK

05:05.430 --> 05:07.348
{\an8}I WROTE DOWN HER NUMBER
NEXT TO YOURS.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.058
{\an8}SO WHEN I CALLED YOU--

05:09.142 --> 05:10.268
{\an8}- YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR A BABY-SITTER.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.061
{\an8}- I AM SO SORRY.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.938
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T REMEMBER
THE BABY-SITTER

05:14.022 --> 05:16.399
{\an8}HAVING AN ENGLISH ACCENT,
BUT THEN I THOUGHT, "GREAT.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.901
{\an8}SHE SOUNDS JUST
LIKE MARY POPPINS."

05:18.985 --> 05:20.903
{\an8}- YES, WELL,
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE

05:20.987 --> 05:24.407
{\an8}THAN A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR
TO MAKE THIS ONE GO DOWN.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.701
{\an8}- I AM SO SORRY AND I--

05:26.784 --> 05:28.119
{\an8}I KNOW THIS
IS OUT OF LINE,

05:28.202 --> 05:30.079
{\an8}BUT WOULD YOU CONSIDER
STAYING ANYWAY?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.248
{\an8}I WOULDN'T ASK,
BUT I'M IN A BIND.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.751
{\an8}TONIGHT'S A REALLY
BIG NIGHT FOR ME.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.586

{\an8}- [chuckles]

05:38.004 --> 05:39.255
{\an8}COULD THIS POSSIBLY
GET ANY WORSE?

05:39.338 --> 05:40.590
{\an8}- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.924
{\an8}THIS ISN'T FAIR.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.092
{\an8}I SHOULDN'T ASK YOU TO STAY.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.927
{\an8}I'M JUST GONNA CALL
THE RESTAURANT.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.638
{\an8}PROBABLY CAN'T STOP
THE FIREWORKS, BUT, UH--

IF I RUN IT BY YOU?

EYES ON YOU,

CONFIDENT NOW.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.201
JACOB'S PULL-UPS ARE
IN THE BATHROOM CABINET.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.661
HE'S PRETTY MUCH
POTTY TRAINED NOW,

06:51.744 --> 06:53.496
BUT HE STILL LIKE
TO WEAR ONE ON HIS HEAD.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.498
- HA.
WHO DOESN'T?

06:55.581 --> 06:58.334
- HEY, JACOB, COME ON OUT
AND MEET YOUR BABY-SITTER.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.713
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO PRETTY CINDY?

07:02.797 --> 07:05.133
- OH, SORRY, KID.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.509
- YES, TONIGHT,

TELL IT AGAIN.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.523
OH, OKAY, FINE.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.483
SO WHAT DID THE SPANX
DO TO YOU?

07:22.567 --> 07:25.361
- WELL, NOT TO BELITTLE
YOUR EXPERIENCE, JOY,

07:25.444 --> 07:28.823
BUT YOUR EXPERIENCE IS SO MUCH
SMALLER THAN MINE WAS.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.534
SO IT WAS STILL A FEW DAYS
BEFORE JOY NEEDED THE SPANX,

07:31.617 --> 07:34.245
SO I THOUGHT, "WELL,
I'M POOR AND OUT OF WORK.

07:34.328 --> 07:38.749
THAT'S HE PERFECT TIME
TO BELIEVE IN MAGIC."

- HELLO?

07:54.932 --> 07:56.267
- OH, HI.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.229
VICTORIA, YOU MUST KNOW
MELANIE GRIFFITH.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.772
- OF COURSE.
MELANIE, WE'VE NEVER MET,

08:01.856 --> 08:02.815
BUT I LOVE YOUR WORK.

08:02.899 --> 08:03.900

08:03.983 --> 08:05.735
- AND I LOVE YOUR SHOES.
- AND I LOVE YOUR SHOES.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.278
- AND I LOVE MY SHOES.

WHY DON'T I START
TO TAPE ROLLING,

08:08.613 --> 08:10.072
SO YOU TWO CAN READ
TOGETHER?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.741
- OKAY.
- READ TOGETHER?

08:11.824 --> 08:13.075
- YEAH, I'M AMANDA.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.412

IN THE MOVIE.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.625
YOU'RE PLAYING MY DAUGHTER?

08:20.708 --> 08:23.419
OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAS BEEN
SOME SORT OF MISTAKE.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.588
- WHAT KIND OF MISTAKE?

08:25.671 --> 08:26.714
- I MEAN, MELANIE,

08:26.797 --> 08:28.549
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL,
TALENTED WOMAN,

08:28.633 --> 08:29.926
BUT I AM NOT SURE
THAT AN AUDIENCE

08:30.009 --> 08:31.093
WOULD BUY YOU AS MY DAUGHTER.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.803
I MEAN, COME ON.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.054
LOOK AT US.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.140

OKAY, GOOD.
FINE. WONDERFUL.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.488
OF COURSE I'LL FORGIVE YOU.

08:50.571 --> 08:54.617
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY LITTLE--

08:54.700 --> 08:57.912
MY LITTLE GI--

08:57.995 --> 08:59.747
YOU CAUGHT ME.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.084
YOU SEE, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY
READ THE SCRIPT.

09:03.167 --> 09:07.088
UM, IS THIS SOME SORT
OF <i> AVATAR,</i> CGI THING?

09:07.171 --> 09:09.966
PERHAPS WE'RE BOTH GREEN
WITH TAILS.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.592
- NO.
- I SEE.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.595
THEN AM I GETTING PUNKED?
SHOULD I ACT SURPRISED?

09:14.679 --> 09:15.805
- NO.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.141
-<i> C'EST UNE COMEDIE GROTESQUE?</i>

09:19.225 --> 09:21.602
- YOU MEAN THE FRENCH CONCEIT
WHERE THE ROLES OF THE PLAY

09:21.686 --> 09:24.438
ARE CAST WITH THE MOST
UNSUITABLE ACTORS POSSIBLE?

09:24.522 --> 09:27.775
NO.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.485
- LET'S JUST RUN THE SCENE
AND TRY

09:29.568 --> 09:30.861
TO HAVE FUN WITH IT, OKAY?

09:30.945 --> 09:32.280
MELANIE, WHY DON'T YOU START?

09:32.363 --> 09:35.491
- ALL RIGHT.

09:35.574 --> 09:38.661
MOTHER, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
FOR ME IN GATORSBURG,

09:38.744 --> 09:39.870
BUT IF I LEAVE,
WILL YOU EVER

09:39.954 --> 09:41.622
BE ABLE TO FORGIVE ME?

09:41.706 --> 09:45.001
- OH, AMANDA...

09:45.084 --> 09:47.128
OF COURSE I'LL FORGIVE YOU.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.337
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO HERE--

09:48.421 --> 09:50.798
- VICTORIA,
JUST READ IT NORMALLY.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.174
- NORMALLY?

09:52.258 --> 09:55.511
WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

09:55.594 --> 09:58.139
- HE MEANS JUST USE
YOUR REGULAR VOICE.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.850
YOU KNOW, MY OWN MOTHER IS ONLY
A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN YOU.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.186
- YOU TAKE THAT BACK.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.855
NOBODY KNOWS HOW OLD I AM.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.691
I AM AN EVERGREEN.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.651
- WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
CUT YOU IN HALF

10:10.735 --> 10:14.030
AND COUNT THE RINGS.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.865
- YOU KNOW, IT IS JUST
SO CRAZY TO THINK

10:15.948 --> 10:19.201
THAT ANYONE WITH EYES COULD
BELIEVE THAT I BORE YOU.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.871
- ACTUALLY, YOU DO BORE ME.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.372
- HOW DARE YOU?

10:23.456 --> 10:27.335
YOU BUSTY, BLEACHED-BLONDE
BOMBSHELL.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.253
- HEY, I AM A NATURAL BLONDE.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.047
BUT WHILE WE'RE
ON THE SUBJECT,

10:31.130 --> 10:33.924
YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK
THOSE GRAY HAIRS

10:34.008 --> 10:36.385
THAT YOU'RE PASSING OFF
AS HIGHLIGHTS.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.014
- I BET THE ONLY MAGAZINE
YOU EVER READ IS <i> HIGHLIGHTS.</i>

10:40.097 --> 10:41.349
- OOH.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.601
NICE COMEBACK...MOMMY.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.227
- [gasps]
DON'T YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.147
- AH-YA!

10:48.230 --> 10:50.524
YOU FORGET THAT I DID
ALL MY OWN STUNTS

10:50.608 --> 10:52.360
IN <i> CRAZY IN ALABAMA.</i>

10:52.443 --> 10:55.446
- AND YOU FORGET A LITTLE
LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIE

10:55.529 --> 10:58.032
CALLED <i> SOCCER MOM NINJA.</i>

10:58.115 --> 11:00.117
- AH!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.709
- SO CLEARLY,
I HAVE BEEN CURSED

11:08.793 --> 11:10.044
BY THESE STUPID SPANX.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.837
NOW ALL OVER SHOW BUSINESS,
VICTORIA CHASE

11:11.921 --> 11:14.090
IS KNOWN AS
A "DIFFICULT ACTRESS."

11:14.173 --> 11:16.759
- TO WATCH?

11:21.263 --> 11:23.724
- OH, ELKA.

11:23.808 --> 11:28.270
DEAR, SWEET,
SHAR-PEI IN A SWEATSHIRT ELKA.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.731
- SO WHAT DO YOU BLAME
THE GIRDLE FOR?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.983
- OH, WELL, IN MY CASE,
I JUST WANTED

11:33.067 --> 11:34.693
TO LOOK BETTER IN THE DRESS
I WAS WEARING.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.987
SEE, I'VE HAD MY EYE
ON THIS CUTE GUY

11:37.071 --> 11:39.240
FOR A FEW WEEKS AND HE GOES
INTO STORMI'S

11:39.323 --> 11:40.950
EVERY SATURDAY,
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD

11:41.033 --> 11:42.785
TAKE THE SPANX OUT
FOR A STROLL.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.581
- HI.
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

11:47.665 --> 11:50.292
- UH, NO.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.502
ALTHOUGH I KEEP
PUTTING MY COAT ON IT

11:51.585 --> 11:54.505
AND TAKING MY COAT BACK OFF
AND PUTTING IT BACK ON AGAIN.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.924
I'M SORT OF SAVING IT
FOR THIS CUTE GUY OVER THERE

11:57.007 --> 11:57.967
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW I EXIST.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.260
AND WHY AM I STILL TALKING?

11:59.343 --> 12:00.302
YOU JUST WANT TO SIT.
I'M SORRY.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.303
SIT, PLEASE.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.848
- THANKS.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.599
YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF HERE
FOR THE SAME REASON.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.768
THERE'S THIS REALLY CUTE GUY
I'VE BEEN WATCHING.

12:07.852 --> 12:08.853
- OH, NO.

12:08.936 --> 12:09.770
DOES HE LOOK LIKE ROB LOWE,

12:09.854 --> 12:12.273
ONLY BLONDER AND,
IRONICALLY, SMARTER?

12:12.356 --> 12:13.941
IS HE PLAYING DARTS OVER THERE?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.234
PLEASE TELL ME HE'S NOT
PLAYING DARTS.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.861
- NO, IT'S THE BARTENDER.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.362
- BEN!

12:18.446 --> 12:19.697
OH, WE ALWAYS THOUGHT
HE WAS GAY.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.241
BUT YOU JUST GO FOR IT.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.617
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO INTRODUCE YOU,

12:23.701 --> 12:24.785
BECAUSE WE'RE SORT OF FRIENDS.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.163
- OH, NO.
I'M WAY TOO SHY.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.831
WHICH IS WHY
I WROTE HIM THIS NOTE.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.792
MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE IT
TO HIM FOR ME.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.127
I MEAN, KIND OF ROMANTIC,
RIGHT?

12:33.210 --> 12:34.795
- OH, YEAH.
SURE.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.131
IN A THIRD GRADE
SORT OF WAY.

12:37.214 --> 12:41.719
BEN, IF I HAD A NOTE
FROM SOMEBODY WHO LIKED YOU,

12:41.802 --> 12:45.347
WOULD YOU BE HOPING IT WAS
FROM A GIRL OR A GUY?

12:45.431 --> 12:49.143
- THAT DEPENDS
ON WHAT IT SAYS.

12:49.226 --> 12:53.731
- HERE.

12:53.814 --> 12:54.732
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:54.815 --> 12:56.192
BEN?

12:56.275 --> 12:57.693
"EMPTY THE CASH REGISTER.
I HAVE A GUN"?

12:57.776 --> 13:00.112
THAT'S NOT VERY ROMANTIC.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.865
OH!
OOH.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.200
- THANKS.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.493
AND GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR GUY.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.578
- OH, THANK--

13:10.039 --> 13:11.332
- LET ME THROUGH!
I'M A DOCTOR!

13:11.415 --> 13:12.708
- A DOCTOR?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.168
I MEAN, HELP HER!

13:14.251 --> 13:16.003
SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE!

13:16.086 --> 13:17.213
STAT!

13:17.296 --> 13:20.508
- THANKS.

13:20.591 --> 13:21.926
- I NEED MORE
THAN THESE NAPKINS

13:22.009 --> 13:23.427
TO MAKE A TOURNIQUET.

13:23.511 --> 13:27.765
I NEED SOMETHING
WITH COMPRESSION.

13:27.848 --> 13:31.435
DOES ANYBODY HERE HAVE ANYTHING
THAT'S STRONG AND STRETCHY?

13:34.563 --> 13:37.191
IT'S A MATTER
OF LIFE OR DEATH!

13:37.274 --> 13:38.901
- I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT CAN HELP.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.570
BUT YOU HAVE TO TURN AWAY.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.072
I SAID TURN AWAY.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.879
- YOU KNOW, THESE SPANX
REALLY LOOK GREAT

13:58.963 --> 13:59.922
WHILE YOU'RE WEARING 'EM,
BUT THEY

14:00.005 --> 14:02.258
ARE NOT PRETTY TO TAKE OFF.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.593
I MEAN, AS SOON AS YOU
ROLL DOWN THE WAISTBAND,

14:04.677 --> 14:08.597
THIS CREATES THIS TOTALLY
UNNATURAL SPILLAGE, RIGHT?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.766
IT'S LIKE YOUR STOMACH
IS A VOLCANO

14:10.849 --> 14:13.936
AND LAYERS OF MOLTEN LAVA

14:14.019 --> 14:17.565
AND IT'S JUST, LIKE,
LAPPING OVER THE TOP.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.025
- OKAY, I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.445
STOP BLAMING
AN INNOCENT GIRDLE.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.030
YOU'RE DESPERATE.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.282
YOU'RE VAIN.

14:26.365 --> 14:30.578
AND YOU'RE GULLIBLE.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.455
- I SAY WE BURN HER TOO.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.129
[cell phone rings]

14:40.212 --> 14:42.506
OH, RIGHT AFTER I SPEAK
TO MY AGENT.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.174
HERE.
[doorbell rings]

14:44.258 --> 14:49.763
- OH, I'LL GET IT.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.640
OH, HI.
IT'S YOU.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.643
DR. "I'M A DOCTOR."

14:54.727 --> 14:56.312
[chuckles]

14:56.395 --> 14:57.646
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.814
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW
YOUR NAME.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.482
- I'M AARON.
- I'M--

15:00.566 --> 15:03.652
- MELANIE HOPE MORETTI.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.279
I HAVE YOUR WALLET.
- OH.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.488
- YOU MUST HAVE
DROPPED IT WHEN YOU

15:06.572 --> 15:09.491
WERE TRYING TO GIVE ME
YOUR GIRDLE.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.959
- SPANX.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.586
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.799
ANYWAY, YOUR LICENSE
HAD YOUR ADDRESS--

15:25.883 --> 15:26.759
- OH!
YOU SAW MY LICENSE?

15:26.842 --> 15:29.136
I MEAN, YEAH, SURE,
THE ADDRESS IS CORRECT,

15:29.219 --> 15:31.972
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE WEIGHT AND THE AGE,

15:32.056 --> 15:33.557
IT'S TOTALLY TYPOS.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.351
AND THAT PICTURE.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.894
- THAT PICTURE'S ADORABLE.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.520
- OH, STOP IT.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.522
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.067
SAY IT AGAIN.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.527
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT
OVER DINNER THIS WEEK?

15:45.611 --> 15:48.030
- WELL, THAT WOULD
BE PERFECT,

15:48.113 --> 15:51.075
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
BE HUNGRY THIS WEEK.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.497
- I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.624
- I'LL ANSWER TOMORROW.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.710
AND I'LL STOP DOING THAT.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.878
[laughs]

16:02.961 --> 16:04.088
DON'T BURN THE SPANX.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.714
I JUST GOT A DATE
WITH THE DREAMY DOCTOR.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.258
- AND I JUST GOT A JOB.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.219
THE VIDEOTAPE OF MY TUSSLE
WITH MELANIE GRIFFITH

16:10.302 --> 16:12.888
MADE THE ROUNDS OF A FEW
PROMINENT CASTING DIRECTORS

16:12.971 --> 16:14.890
AND I HAVE BEEN OFFERED
A STAR TURN

16:14.973 --> 16:17.351
ON <i> ALL MY CHILDREN</i> OPPOSITE...

16:17.434 --> 16:23.065
SUSAN LUCCI.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.901
- WILL YOU BE PLAYING
HER MOTHER TOO?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.199
- NO.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.076
I AM GOING TO CHEW HER UP
AND SPIT HER OUT

16:34.159 --> 16:35.619
AND HOPE THERE'S A MOUTHWASH
STRONG ENOUGH

16:35.703 --> 16:37.871
TO GET THE TASTE OF BITCH
OUT OF MY MOUTH.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.748
I'M BACK!

16:39.832 --> 16:41.250
- CONGRATS.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.043
LET'S CELEBRATE THIS
WITH A GLASS OF WINE

16:43.127 --> 16:45.421
IN FRONT OF A ROARING FIRE
OF SPANX.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.256
- NO!
I NEED THOSE FOR MY DATE.

16:47.339 --> 16:51.677
- I'LL BUY YOU A NEW PAIR
WITH MY BABY-SITTING MONEY.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.472
WHERE ARE MY MATCHES?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.307
AWW.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.308
JACOB.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.518
- WHAT IS IT?

16:59.601 --> 17:02.646
- THE LITTLE BOY I BABY-SAT
FOR DREW THIS PICTURE OF ME.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.982
- OH, IT'S A SMILEY FACE.

17:05.065 --> 17:10.612
- HE GOT THE STICK FIGURE
PART RIGHT.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.156
- THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.074
- HE'S JUST THREE.

17:14.157 --> 17:15.784
- SO HOW COME YOU'RE SMILING
IN THAT PICTURE

17:15.867 --> 17:18.078
IF YOU HAD SUCH
A TERRIBLE TIME?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.414
- IT WASN'T TERRIBLE.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.625
TO BE HONEST, JACOB AND I HAD
A WONDERFUL EVENING TOGETHER.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.295
"SWEET DREAMS, MR. MOON.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.672
"SWEET DREAMS, MR. STAR.

17:28.756 --> 17:32.301
"SWEET DREAMS, MR. COMET,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.678
"SWEET DREAMS, LITTLE TRUCK.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.306
SWEET DREAMS, LITTLE DUCK."

17:37.389 --> 17:40.058
GOOD GOD,
THIS BOOK IS TEDIOUS.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.812
DON'T YOU THINK, JACOB?

17:43.896 --> 17:47.316
AND PERHAPS THAT'S THE POINT.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.817
THIS IS SILLY.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.444
I TOOK CARE OF A LITTLE BOY.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.820
IT WAS FINE.
NOW IT'S OVER.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.155
- ARE YOU SURE?

17:53.238 --> 17:55.157
- NO.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.533
I'M NOT.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.494
- YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THE URGE
TO MOTHER

17:58.577 --> 18:00.120
IS PURELY CHEMICAL.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.830
YOUR BODY TELLS YOU
IT'S READY,

18:01.914 --> 18:06.335
SO YOU GET KNOCKED UP
AND THEN YOU SPIT ONE OUT.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.171
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED
BOTH TIMES FOR ME.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.507
- VICTORIA, YOU HAVE
THREE CHILDREN.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.638
- LOOK, I KNOW I HAVE A GROWN
SON OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,

18:17.721 --> 18:19.848
BUT I DIDN'T RAISE HIM.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.683
AND BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,
I'D LIKE TO RAISE A CHILD

18:21.767 --> 18:23.185
OF MY OWN.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.312
I THINK I MIGHT BE GOOD AT IT.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.982
- I BET YOU WOULD
BE GOOD AT IT.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.400
- AND?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.694
- NO "AND."

18:32.778 --> 18:36.532
JUST TAKE THE COMPLIMENT.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.699
- ELKA'S RIGHT.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.701
YOU WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOM.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.578
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.
YOU'RE FUN.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.996
YOU'RE CARING.

18:43.080 --> 18:47.584
- SO HOW LONG WE GONNA
YANK HER CHAIN?

18:47.668 --> 18:51.880
YOU'RE TOO OLD.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.216
- WELL, IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.051
THE SCROGGS WOMEN ARE FAMOUS
FOR HAVING BABIES

18:56.134 --> 18:58.512
LATER IN LIFE AND THERE'S
ALWAYS ADOPTION.

18:58.595 --> 19:02.015
- YEAH, YOU GAVE ONE AWAY.
YOU DESERVE ONE BACK.

19:02.099 --> 19:02.891
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
THE GIVE-A-PENNY,

19:02.975 --> 19:05.727
TAKE-A-PENNY TRAY
AT THE GAS STATION.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.855
- I KNOW THE TIMING
COULDN'T BE WORSE

19:07.938 --> 19:09.273
FOR ME TO COME
TO THIS EPIPHANY,

19:09.356 --> 19:12.401
BUT THE THOUGHT
OF IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

19:12.484 --> 19:16.071
MAYBE THESE TURNED OUT
TO BE LUCKY FOR ME TOO.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.948
- MY TURN.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.908
- WAIT A MINUTE.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.578
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE
IN MAGIC.

19:22.661 --> 19:26.164
- DESPERATE TIMES CALL
FOR DESPERATE MEASURES.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.920
- IT SAYS HERE THAT IT TAKES

19:32.004 --> 19:35.257
AN AVERAGE OF 22 MONTHS FOR
A WOMAN OVER 40 TO GET PREGNANT.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.218
- IS THAT COUNTING
THE 18 MONTHS

19:38.302 --> 19:42.598
IT'LL TAKE YOU TO FIND SOMEBODY
WILLING TO GO THERE?

19:42.681 --> 19:43.932
OH, LOOK.
HERE WE GO.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.101
GRADY'S UP TO BAT.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.394
[baseball bat cracks]

19:47.477 --> 19:48.812
- BAM! WOW!

19:48.896 --> 19:50.772
GRADY SIZEMORE'S HAVING
SOME KIND OF GAME.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.441
THAT'S THREE HOME RUNS TODAY.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.068
AND IS IT JUST ME
OR DOES GRADY'S UNIFORM

19:55.152 --> 19:56.987
LOOK A LITTLE SMOOTHER
THAN USUAL?

19:57.070 --> 20:00.282
I MEAN, I CANNOT SEE A LINE.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.246
- THAT'S RIGHT.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.248
I SPANX'D HIM.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.084
