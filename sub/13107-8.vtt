BUT DON'T YOU DARE
TRY TO PRETEND

40:14.910 --> 40:18.334
THAT WHAT I DO IS ANYTHING LESS

40:18.380 --> 40:19.347
* WHY AM I AFRAID TO BE FREE?

40:19.380 --> 40:20.642
AND AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,

40:20.680 --> 40:22.375
I THINK IT TAKES
A LOT MORE INTEGRITY

40:22.420 --> 40:23.318
TO GO AI-TER
CORRUPT COPS

40:23.350 --> 40:25.443

YEAH, WELL, IT'S TOO EARLY
TO TELL WHAT IT MEANS YET --

40:58.150 --> 40:59.788
EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES
TO YOU.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.344
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'VE BEEN CLEARED

41:01.390 --> 41:02.982
OF ANY CONNECTION
TO THE BOMBING.

41:04.730 --> 41:07.949
WHICH MEANS --
WHICH MEANS WHAT?

41:07.990 --> 41:13.428
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN COME BACK
TO WORK, FREE AND CLEAR.

41:13.470 --> 41:18.032

AN OFFICIAL APOLOGY,

41:18.070 --> 41:24.100

41:35.420 --> 41:38.116

41:38.160 --> 41:40.048
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

41:40.090 --> 41:43.821
I FEEL LIKE I JUST RUINED
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE'S LIVES.

41:43.860 --> 41:45.828
THEIR LIVES
WERE RUINED ALREADY.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.929
THEY JUST
DIDN'T KNOW IT YET.

41:47.970 --> 41:49.835
IT'S UPSETTING.

41:49.870 --> 41:51.838
YOU KNOW, TRACI DIDN'T KNOW
THAT STEVE WAS BAD.

41:51.870 --> 41:53.963
WELL, IN MY OPINION,
STEVE WASN'T BAD.

41:54.010 --> 41:57.036
HE JUST DID A BAD THING
AND THEN ANOTHER BAD THING

41:57.080 --> 41:59.708
AND THEN ANOTHER,
AND THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.913
[ SIGHS ]
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

42:02.950 --> 42:05.418
I WANT TO GET INTO P.J.s
AND SIT ON THE COUCH

42:05.450 --> 42:07.384
AND BE COMPLETELY
BORING WITH YOU.
