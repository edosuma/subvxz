WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:02.836
YOUNG MEN:
Stewart! Stewart! Stewart!

00:02.870 --> 00:05.639
Stewart! Stewart!

00:05.673 --> 00:08.042
(grunting)
(gasping, groaning)

00:08.076 --> 00:09.310
Didn't feel it.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.313
(gasping, whooping)

00:12.346 --> 00:13.814
Stewart's such a
freakin' beast!

00:13.847 --> 00:15.816
Lax season, baby.
It's finally here.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.818
Dude, I'm
laser-focused.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.420
If I can show Coach
what I'm capable of,

00:19.453 --> 00:21.822
I got a shot at
varsity next year.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.325
Oh, for sure. You're, like,
the fastest kid in eighth grade.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.095
I'm the fastest kid
in the whole school.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.596
YOUNG MAN: All right,
boys, listen up.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.697
Great training camp.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.332
Squad's looking
real strong this year.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.201
Stewart, your chest is bleeding.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.702
No, it's not.

00:34.735 --> 00:35.703
Yeah, it is.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.838
No.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.241
Okay, that's what
I'm talking about!

00:40.274 --> 00:41.209
Yeah.
(chuckling)

00:41.242 --> 00:43.211
As long as we keep
raising banners,

00:43.244 --> 00:45.045
we're untouchable!

00:45.079 --> 00:47.047
Lockwood Owls, baby!

00:47.081 --> 00:49.250
(cheering, whooping)

00:49.283 --> 00:50.351
You're the freakin'
man, Pierce!

00:50.384 --> 00:53.254
(screeching)

00:53.287 --> 00:54.855
Okay. All right.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.091
Now, as a thank you
for a kickass training camp,

00:57.125 --> 00:59.860
us seniors have
a little present

00:59.893 --> 01:02.696
to keep all of you guys,
uh, motivated.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.098
Gentlemen...

01:04.132 --> 01:05.366
(outgoing message chime)

01:05.399 --> 01:06.700
...check your phones.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.001
(phones chiming, buzzing)

01:09.103 --> 01:12.072
Damn. She's unbelievable.

01:12.106 --> 01:16.710
That picture comes to us
from the legendary Robby Ragosa,

01:16.744 --> 01:18.146
who's playing D1

01:18.179 --> 01:20.148
at Virginia, smokin' goals

01:20.181 --> 01:22.150
and smokin' girls.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.284
(whooping, chuckling)

01:23.317 --> 01:24.885
Wait, why is there
no face on mine?

01:24.918 --> 01:27.155
There's no face on
any of 'em, doof.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.089
It's a
freakin' sext.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.724
Oh.

01:30.758 --> 01:34.094
Look at that body.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.896
And, oh, that tattoo.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.731
It's like a... it's
like a freakin'...

01:37.765 --> 01:38.732
Unicorn.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.202
Mr. Pemberton.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.674
Where-where am I...?

01:46.707 --> 01:48.276
Damn, Alba, how many cars

01:48.309 --> 01:50.110
can one person crash?
It was

01:50.144 --> 01:51.612
not my fault this time.
You hit

01:51.645 --> 01:53.914
a parked car.
How is it not your fault?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.317
That guy parked like a maniac.
Alba,

01:56.350 --> 01:58.819
other people worked very hard
to be able to buy those cars,

01:58.852 --> 02:00.621
and now they're mine. Okay?
They're not yours.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.156
They're kind of...
They're, like, half-mine.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.292
They're ours. They're our cars.
No. They're ours.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.759
MICKEY: They're ours,
and I want you to be

02:05.793 --> 02:07.361
more careful with our cars.
Alba, just be careful.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.629
Well, I cannot
help it. When I am

02:08.662 --> 02:10.198
behind the wheel, I am a slave

02:10.231 --> 02:12.300
to the power of the machine.
Listen,

02:12.333 --> 02:13.434
just clean up
your act or else

02:13.467 --> 02:14.968
it's back
to the minivan, okay?
Well,

02:15.002 --> 02:16.437
I mean, don't.
Oh, why you got to put me
in a cage?

02:16.470 --> 02:19.173
I have no choice
at this point.
Don't go crazy, don't go crazy.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.941
I need you to sign this.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.343
No. What is it?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.777
It's freakin' bullcrap.
That's what it is.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.513
The lacrosse team
was passing around some pic

02:25.546 --> 02:27.147
of some naked chick
after practice.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.782
Off to a creepy start.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.185
Then Principal Gibbons
just pops out of nowhere

02:31.219 --> 02:33.321
and busts me.
Now I have to go in front

02:33.354 --> 02:36.023
of the honor board and tell 'em
who else was involved.

02:36.056 --> 02:37.225
What's an honor board?

02:37.258 --> 02:38.792
Why don't you ask her?
She's on it.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.463
(sighs) It's a committee
of students and teachers

02:42.496 --> 02:44.198
that handle
disciplinary matters.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.866
Sounds like a committee
of narcs and rats

02:45.899 --> 02:47.468
that handle snitching matters.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.203
I'm not a rat, okay?
It just looks really good

02:49.237 --> 02:50.971
on your college applications.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.806
Uh-oh. Nerd alert, Ben.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.042
(giggles)
Yeah. Nerd.
Nerd.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.377
Shut up. You don't know
what you're talking about.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.045
Well, I know I got to go in
front of the stupid honor board

02:58.078 --> 02:59.179
with Larry Flynt here.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.214
This is not a joke.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.383
I am not joking.
I don't want to do this.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.485
All right, if I rat out my
teammates, they'll destroy me.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.987
And if I don't,
Principal Gibbons will just crap

03:07.020 --> 03:08.589
all over my future.
Guys,

03:08.622 --> 03:11.392
we don't snitch.
That's it. End of story.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.561
He's not gonna snitch.
He's just gonna tell the truth.

03:13.594 --> 03:14.695
Will you listen

03:14.728 --> 03:17.398
to yourself? "Just
tell the truth."

03:17.431 --> 03:18.599
Let me tell you a
little story about a guy

03:18.632 --> 03:21.001
I grew up with who
just told the truth.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.572
Brendan Carthas. (growls)
Was very good-looking,

03:24.605 --> 03:26.407
but he got pinched
with a whole backseat

03:26.440 --> 03:28.008
filled with
bootleg Poison tapes.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.411
Cops offered him a
deal. He took it.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.246
Then he wound up a few
days later in the back

03:32.280 --> 03:34.014
of a garbage truck,
getting crushed

03:34.047 --> 03:36.517
until his guts shot out of his
butt like a tube of toothpaste.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.451
ALBA: Oh, no, no, no.
Come on, Benito.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.719
We go now. Come on.
No,

03:38.752 --> 03:39.853
he should hear this.
(grunts)

03:39.887 --> 03:41.289
No, no, no.
Ben, you snitch, you die!

03:41.322 --> 03:42.222
No!
SABRINA:
Oh, God.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.024
Chip, listen to me,

03:44.057 --> 03:46.860
don't make this
a thing, okay?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.028
No, actually,
don't listen to her.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.430
I'll handle this, all right?

03:49.463 --> 03:51.231
And what if
you don't?

03:51.265 --> 03:53.534
Then you shut your mouth and you
do your time like a man, bitch.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.602
(groans)

03:54.635 --> 03:56.236
(groans)

03:56.270 --> 03:58.339
Wrong with these people?

04:01.275 --> 04:04.044
(tires screech)

04:04.077 --> 04:06.314
ALBA: Okay,
Benito, let's go.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.317
(sighs)
Oh, be careful. Crazy drivers.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.419
Excuse me!

04:11.452 --> 04:13.287
Did you not see me waiting?
Well,

04:13.321 --> 04:14.888
you waited too long, my friend.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.557
Come on, Benito.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.893
Mmm.
(chuckling)

04:19.927 --> 04:21.261
That is very nice. Mmm.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.563
(car alarm wailing)
You tried to trick me,

04:22.596 --> 04:24.432
but that is blueberry.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.634
That is blueberry.
That's good, that's good.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.502
Mmm.

04:28.536 --> 04:29.637
(alarm continues)

04:29.670 --> 04:32.640
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

04:32.673 --> 04:34.107
Not the Rolls.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.476
Benito, did you see
who did this?

04:35.509 --> 04:36.644
Yep.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.278
Tell me. Who did it, Benito?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.314
No way. I'm never
gonna snitch.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.950
I don't want to be
butt toothpaste.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.853
Um...

04:45.886 --> 04:47.455
Hello. Can I help you?

04:47.488 --> 04:48.322
Principal Gibbons?

04:48.356 --> 04:49.289
Yes.
Hi there.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.658
I am Mickey. I'm, uh,

04:50.691 --> 04:52.493
Chip Pemberton's aunt.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.595
Oh. Well,
please don't sit on my car.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.796
Oh.
Yeah.

04:55.829 --> 04:59.667
Oh, and thank you
for denting my hood.

04:59.700 --> 05:04.505
Oh. Pretty sure that was
already there when I walked up.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.474
It wasn't. No, that
wasn't there, that...
Yeah, it was. No, it was there.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.675
What do you want?
Well,

05:07.708 --> 05:09.343
I came to talk
to you about Chip.
Yes,

05:09.377 --> 05:10.478
well, there was
an incident...

05:10.511 --> 05:11.479
He sucks. I get it.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.813
And I'm pretty sure
you get it, too.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.616
But is this really a fair
position to be putting him in?

05:15.649 --> 05:18.519
How can I explain this
to you? The success

05:18.552 --> 05:21.522
of our institution is
ensconced in our values.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.123
And when these values
swing askew,

05:23.156 --> 05:25.826
there are protocols in place
to right the ship.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.895
Okay. Well, where I'm from,

05:27.928 --> 05:30.964
we don't have protocols,
'cause we aren't nerds.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.366
But we do have values,

05:32.400 --> 05:33.701
and one of them
is you don't snitch.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.369
Look, it's
not up to me.

05:35.403 --> 05:38.038
We have an honor board
for this very reason.
Yeah,

05:38.071 --> 05:39.707
I heard all about
your little honor board.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.142
And let me tell you
about a guy I knew growing up

05:42.175 --> 05:44.044
who was also very honorable.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.647
Brendan Carthas.
My God, he was

05:46.680 --> 05:49.216
so attractive. This guy was...
Okay. I do not have
time for this.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.385
No... Well, I'm coming back
around to the snitching thing.
I have a lunch meeting

05:51.419 --> 05:53.020
that I'm late for.
I'm saying he was a hot
senior. It took me

05:53.053 --> 05:54.588
many years to get him
in the sack.
I will see you
at Chip's hearing.

05:54.622 --> 05:57.157
Hey, Chip, do you
believe in God?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.158
What?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.427
Hey, Chip.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.428
Hey, Sabrina.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.865
(sighs)

06:06.033 --> 06:07.501
Got good news.
What?

06:07.535 --> 06:08.869
Fixed your Gibbons problem.
Really?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.871
Mm-hmm. All you have to do
is tell him who sent you

06:10.904 --> 06:12.773
that picture, he's gonna
cancel the honor board

06:12.806 --> 06:14.875
and save you
the public humiliation.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.577
How is this good news?

06:16.610 --> 06:18.412
Then everyone's gonna call
me a traitor like you.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.213
Chip, take the deal.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.682
PIERCE:
Hey, Chip!

06:21.715 --> 06:23.751
Come over here, man.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.586
(whispers):
Don't do it.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.789
Later, traitor.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.226
Hey, guys. What's up?

06:33.260 --> 06:34.327
Take a seat, man.

06:36.664 --> 06:39.099
So I heard Gibbons
nabbed you yesterday.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.035
Oh, yeah. Uh, don't worry
about it. It was worth it.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.705
Uh, the picture
was... insane.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.040
Who's that girl?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.609
(chuckles)

06:48.642 --> 06:51.111
Who knows, man?
Ragosa's the king, huh?

06:51.144 --> 06:54.615
Yeah, he is. Uh, I was up
all night. Was really worked up.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.450
(laughs)

06:56.484 --> 06:59.419
I like this kid, you
know? He's insatiable.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.888
We got to get him
a nickname, quick.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.823
Beaver Dog.
Yes! Yes.

07:02.856 --> 07:06.259
That is 100% it. What do you
think, Beaver Dog? You like it?

07:06.293 --> 07:09.062
Um, yeah. I-I mean,
if... if you guys do.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.831
I love it.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.466
Hey, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.434
Want to come by The Pit?

07:14.468 --> 07:16.470
The Pit? Really?

07:16.504 --> 07:18.639
Are eighth graders
even allowed there?

07:18.672 --> 07:19.607
You'll be with us.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.642
PIERCE: Yeah, man.
We'll hook you up.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.610
We'll see you there, Beaver Dog.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.144
You da man, B-Diddy.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.248
I am the man.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.317
PIERCE:
Yo, grab our trays!

07:30.350 --> 07:32.119
Yeah, yeah. On it.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.291
Mmm, would you like some
delicious cake, Benito?

07:38.325 --> 07:39.827
Yes, please.
Whoa!

07:39.860 --> 07:41.662
Not so fast.
First,

07:41.695 --> 07:43.497
tell me who
scratched the car.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.699
*

07:45.733 --> 07:48.836
Okay.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.837
Mmm.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.272
Delicious.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.707
You must try this. Mmm.

07:53.741 --> 07:57.511
So good. Just say the words,
and it can be yours.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.979
Mmm.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.047
But Mickey said...

08:00.080 --> 08:01.181
(slams fork)

08:01.214 --> 08:02.783
Mickey isn't here.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.151
I am!

08:04.184 --> 08:05.786
Me.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.688
Your best friend.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.056
So,

08:09.089 --> 08:10.891
what's it gonna be?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.127
Oh, it's like that, huh?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.128
Okay.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.197
That is fine.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.867
I didn't want it to
come down like this,

08:19.900 --> 08:22.069
but you leave me
no other choice.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.872
(both laugh)

08:24.905 --> 08:26.674
Now tell me!
Who did it, Benito?

08:26.707 --> 08:28.508
Who did it?
Who did it?
(coughing)

08:28.542 --> 08:29.877
(gasping):
Wait! Stop!

08:29.910 --> 08:31.712
Benito?
Benito, Benito?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.747
I need...
my... inhaler.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.883
Oh, no, no, no, okay, okay,
okay, Benito, hold on.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.818
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.152
(continues gasping)
Shh.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.221
Oh. Here.
Here, here, here.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.891
No, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.793
Is this what you want?

08:47.595 --> 08:49.096
I can't... breathe.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.731
What was that?
I-I couldn't hear you.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.900
You-you can't breathe?

08:52.933 --> 08:57.671
Oh, you help me,
and I help you.

08:57.705 --> 08:58.706
Talk!

08:58.739 --> 09:00.608
Okay... I'll talk.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.776
Good boy, Benito.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.579
(inhales deeply)
That's right, breathe.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.180
Nice, nice.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.849
Okay.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.251
Tell me everything.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.755
It was a man.
Mm-hmm.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.357
(catching breath):
He had hair... and a face...

09:17.390 --> 09:20.127
and he drove away...
in a car.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.629
(breathing heavily)

09:21.662 --> 09:23.063
That's it?

09:23.096 --> 09:25.365
Can I have cake now?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.700
Yes.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.468
Enjoy your cake.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.605
(heart beating)

09:31.639 --> 09:32.973
CHIP:
Hey, guys?

09:33.006 --> 09:34.842
Pierce?

09:36.644 --> 09:38.078
Anyone here?

09:38.111 --> 09:41.281
GIRL:
Over here.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.083
Hi, Chip.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.952
I've been waiting for you.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.955
I knew you'd come.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.290
(gasps)

10:02.670 --> 10:03.971
It's juice.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.873
Gross.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.643
Okay.

10:09.677 --> 10:13.847
That... should... do it.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.650
Okay... no.

10:16.684 --> 10:17.818
Cool.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.453
You gave it stripes.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.995
What...

10:28.028 --> 10:29.863
Welcome home.
What the hell did you
do to my room?

10:29.897 --> 10:31.464
Oh, I destroyed it.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.835
Why?
Had a little chat with
your friend Principal Gibbons.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.636
He says that
it's not up to him

10:36.670 --> 10:37.705
what happens to Chip.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.806
He says it's up to you.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.440
It is not up to me.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.342
There's an entire
honor board that decides.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.711
Well, you better
figure something out,

10:43.744 --> 10:45.145
because if you don't,

10:45.178 --> 10:47.781
I'm gonna have to
go public with this.
What the hell is that?

10:47.815 --> 10:51.118
It's a little machine, and
you stick it into your computer.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.886
Yeah, I know what it is.
What's on it?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.888
Oh, it's your
entire hard drive.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.489
And I've got a feeling

10:56.523 --> 10:58.358
it's not
all that honorable.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.359
(gasps)
Oh.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.493
Oh, I was right.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.295
I want you to listen
to me right now.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.698
I own you.
A...

11:04.732 --> 11:06.166
*

11:08.702 --> 11:09.803
Yeah...

11:09.837 --> 11:11.371
You were just gonna
snitch on me.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.506
What?!
Like hell.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.876
That's called
extortion, stupid.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.377
CHIP:
Hey, guys.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.079
Hi.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.380
Hey, looking good.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.882
Hey, man.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.088
Beaver Dog has arrived.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.189
(groaning)

11:29.222 --> 11:30.257
(laughter)

11:30.290 --> 11:31.691
What's the matter, Chippy?

11:31.725 --> 11:32.893
Pine cone got your nuts?

11:32.926 --> 11:34.394
Ooh, freakin' Geno Pinero!
(groans)

11:34.427 --> 11:35.695
SABRINA:
Hey,

11:35.729 --> 11:36.730
what the hell
are you doing here?

11:36.764 --> 11:38.866
Lax guys invited me.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.200
Chip, those guys are just
covering their own asses.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.501
They don't even like you.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.772
I don't think they'd
call me Beaver Dog

11:44.805 --> 11:46.273
if they didn't like me.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.607
What?

11:47.640 --> 11:49.076
Beaver Dog.
It's my nickname.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.944
No, it's not.
Uh, yeah it is.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.279
The guys gave it to me.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.948
Chip, as easily as I can
save you in this world,

11:54.982 --> 11:55.949
I can destroy you.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.117
And that is exactly
what I will do

11:57.150 --> 11:58.418
if you don't go home
right now.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.419
Beaver Dog!

11:59.452 --> 12:00.854
You've got to be
kidding me.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.522
'Sup, Sabrina.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.824
You coming to
the Brunswick game?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.126
Tool.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.528
Your sister needs
a hug, man.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.763
Yeah.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.299
You guys sure
it's okay I'm here?

12:12.332 --> 12:15.102
Absolutely. Dude,
you're one of us now, okay?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.771
So if anybody messes with you,
just, like, let us know, okay?

12:17.805 --> 12:18.872
Okay.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.941
I mean, Geno Pinero

12:20.974 --> 12:23.743
just kind of smoked me
in the nuts with a pine cone.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.979
Oh, with a dong like that,
you'd think he'd be happier.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.380
Yeah.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.316
Don't worry,
we'll take care of it, okay?

12:29.349 --> 12:30.951
I'm thinking monkey business?

12:30.984 --> 12:32.385
Done.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.787
What's "monkey business?"

12:33.821 --> 12:34.822
Just step back.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.259
He's got to find it.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.193
Yeah.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.966
Ooh.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.267
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh...

12:50.437 --> 12:52.973
(rap music playing)

12:54.875 --> 12:56.409
Get off me!
PIERCE:
Hey, hey, hey!

12:56.443 --> 12:57.978
What the hell, man?

12:58.011 --> 13:00.147
Don't hit that monkey.
What's the matter with you?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.249
(stammering)
I-I didn't hit a monkey.
What is the matter with you?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.017
You didn't hit
that monkey just now?
I-I didn't...

13:04.051 --> 13:06.153
Chip, you see Geno
hit that monkey just now?
That's not...

13:06.186 --> 13:08.956
Uh, yeah?
Yeah! He saw you
hit the monkey, Geno.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.925
And you messed up, because
that's Chip's monkey, okay?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.626
Monkey? Are you serious?
Now apologize.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.028
Does it look like
I'm playing, Pinero?!

13:15.062 --> 13:16.796
Okay, okay, fine.
I'm sorry.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.598
For what?
For hitting the monkey.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.000
Hey, really, it's okay.
PIERCE:
Whose mo...

13:20.033 --> 13:21.201
No, it's not okay, Chip.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.004
Whose monkey are you sorry
for hitting, Pinero?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.705
GENO: Chip's monkey.
PIERCE:
Say it again!

13:25.738 --> 13:27.007
I'm sorry for
hitting Chip's monkey.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.976
I'm sorry for hitting Chip's
monkey, just get off of me.

13:29.009 --> 13:29.977
You good, bro?

13:30.010 --> 13:32.245
Yeah, I'm good.
Just stop.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.116
You're lucky my boy's
got a good heart.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.852
Don't let me catch you beating
up on monkeys ever again.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.687
Now get out of here.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.892
Lax for life?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.526
Lax for life.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.996
Come on, we have to
feed him after this.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.031
He gets very hungry.
Come on.
Okay.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.032
Nice work today.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.700
It's been a big day
for you, huh?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.139
SABRINA:
Hey.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.874
Buckle up, bitch.
I hate you.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.842
Same.
Hey, hey! Shoo!

14:02.876 --> 14:05.012
Get away from my client.
Is that Mom's suit?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.214
Used to be Mom's suit,
now it's my suit.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.016
Oh, your breath
reeks of booze.
Oh, does it?

14:09.049 --> 14:11.018
Yeah.
You gonna go
tell on me, Donnie Brasco?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.019
Get the hell
out of here.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.853
(snickers)
Ugh.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.022
Hope you have a plan.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.856
Yeah, I'll pop 'em in
or something.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.726
For the hearing!
Oh, yeah. Oh, are you kidding
me? Of course I do!

14:19.759 --> 14:20.760
No, I was up all night

14:20.793 --> 14:23.063
watching prep school
movies in preparation.

14:23.096 --> 14:26.066
I got Scent of a Woman,
Dead Poets Society,

14:26.099 --> 14:27.167
uh, Deep Blue Sea,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.069
School Ties.
By the way,

14:29.102 --> 14:30.870
It's a good thing
you're not a Jew,

14:30.904 --> 14:34.007
because that seems to be quite
the deal-breaker in this world.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.043
Did you say Deep Blue Sea?
The shark movie?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.911
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You seen it recently?
Ugh.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.079
No, no.
Totally holds up.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.880
Hey, you ready?
Yeah.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.182
You ready?
You ready for this.
All right. Yeah.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.084
Yeah? You ready?
Huh? You ready for this?
Please. Stop.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.385
Huh? Huh?
Okay. Yeah!

14:45.418 --> 14:46.920
You ready for this?
All right.
Yeah, just-- please?

14:46.954 --> 14:49.722
Let's go stomp on those
Jew-hating bastards.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.258
(softly):
Okay.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.926
It's this way.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.927
Huh?

14:53.961 --> 14:56.096
Oh, yeah.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.098
(sighs)

14:58.131 --> 14:59.399
Ugh.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.101
This is even
sicker than I thought.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.036
There is some real evil

15:03.070 --> 15:05.272
Illuminati-type vibes
in here, right?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.074
The hell are those?

15:07.107 --> 15:08.908
My notes.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.110
Oh, God.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.313
We gather,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.048
as so many
before us have,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.084
in the quest for truth.
Yes, thank you.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.052
No, that's... that's not...

15:19.086 --> 15:21.054
how it works, just...
sit down, please.

15:21.088 --> 15:24.291
As I was saying, we are here
in search of the truth.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.126
Now, is there a board member
who feels compelled to begin...

15:26.159 --> 15:28.161
Yes, there is. Thank you
so much, Principal Gibbons.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.229
Chip,

15:29.262 --> 15:32.299
would you categorize
yourself as popular?

15:32.332 --> 15:35.969
I'm on the lacrosse team,
so, I'm popular.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.137
(team cheering)

15:37.170 --> 15:38.738
I like that.
A lot to like.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.639
Nope, nope, nope.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.142
Yes.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.843
The lacrosse team,
and proud we are

15:43.876 --> 15:46.346
of all they do for our school.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.148
Typically, there isn't
much interaction

15:48.181 --> 15:50.317
between middle school
and varsity players,

15:50.350 --> 15:52.119
though that isn't true
in your case, is it?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.154
I-I guess not.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.589
Hmm. Why do you
think that is?

15:56.623 --> 16:00.027
I don't know. Probably
something to do with...

16:00.060 --> 16:01.161
my speed.
Mm-hmm.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.262
SABRINA:
Your speed.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.430
Yes, I'm sure they're

16:03.463 --> 16:05.332
all enamored with your speed.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.333
He is very fast.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.367
Oh, please don't.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.801
I know because
I raced him once.

16:08.835 --> 16:09.802
All right.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.038
I-I did win, but that's...

16:11.071 --> 16:12.872
because I'm also very fast.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.007
SABRINA:
Chip...

16:14.041 --> 16:15.775
who sent you the photo?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.044
CHIP:
Uh...

16:17.077 --> 16:18.178
I don't know.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.614
Nobody.
So, it was yours then?

16:21.648 --> 16:22.882
Well, no, it wasn't mine.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.984
Huh. So, it must've appeared
out of thin air.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.053
Obviously, it didn't appear...

16:26.086 --> 16:27.220
SABRINA: Chip,
it's come to my attention

16:27.254 --> 16:28.788
that you were recently
given a nickname.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.691
Would you please share said
nickname with the board?

16:33.260 --> 16:34.494
(whispering):
Beaver Dog.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.364
Couldn't quite catch that, Chip.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.566
Beaver Dog.
What?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.568
STEWART:
Yeah! Beaver Dog!
Okay, this is ridiculous.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.571
Oh, sit down.
No, I'm done sitting down!

16:44.604 --> 16:47.240
I've been around, you know.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.508
There was a time

16:48.541 --> 16:51.578
I could see and I have seen.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.712
Brendan Carthas.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.314
You want to ask him

16:54.347 --> 16:55.815
about snitching?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.585
Oopsie, too bad. You can't.
Do you want to know why?

16:58.618 --> 16:59.819
'Cause he's dead.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.688
Okay, can we please
get to the point?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.090
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.391
Now, I don't know

17:04.424 --> 17:07.227
if Chip's silence
is right or wrong,

17:07.260 --> 17:08.128
but this is bigger than us.

17:09.629 --> 17:13.833
This is about two words...
Mon-ey. Wall Street.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.436
That Indian guy
outside the bodega,

17:16.469 --> 17:20.273
pocketing ten bucks to get you
a porno mag, he's gone.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.275
He's long gone,
and he's left us

17:22.309 --> 17:25.612
to spin inside this
sticky web of technology

17:25.645 --> 17:27.046
and swiping.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.548
Hey, don't swipe me, man.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.217
What in God's name
are you talking...

17:30.250 --> 17:32.619
You think they wanted
the sharks to get smarter?

17:32.652 --> 17:35.222
It just happened...

17:35.255 --> 17:37.324
and they all got eaten
because of it.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.260
Are we gonna eat this boy?

17:40.293 --> 17:41.628
Do you all want

17:41.661 --> 17:45.232
to eat this boy because
someone gave him something?

17:45.265 --> 17:49.369
I can do the math.
One, two, three, not it.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.438
Uh... and Chip didn't ask
to be it.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.440
Did you ask to be it?
Nah.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.974
You hear that?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.876
"Nah."

17:56.909 --> 17:58.578
And now you want him

17:58.611 --> 18:01.148
to sell out his unquenchable
sexual appetite

18:01.181 --> 18:02.649
and his integrity?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.651
I got news
for you, friends.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.120
Neither one are for sale.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.588
This young man

18:08.621 --> 18:10.089
chooses honor.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.161
He chooses life.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.998
He chooses lust.

18:22.202 --> 18:26.273
We are but food for worms,
gentlemen.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.608
Worms.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.677
GIBBONS:
I think it's best

18:30.710 --> 18:32.512
we take a short recess,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.947
so we can all process what
has been said here today.

18:34.981 --> 18:39.118
It's a lot. I, myself,
am confused.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.053
(whispering):
You're welcome.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.140
Ugh, get away from me!

19:01.174 --> 19:03.376
What's wrong with you?
It's you!

19:03.410 --> 19:05.345
What-What's me?
You're the girl.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.547
The picture from Robby Ragosa.
I-It's you.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.349
No, but you were...
(vomiting)

19:09.382 --> 19:11.318
You...
(groans)

19:11.351 --> 19:15.154
(gags)
No, no, no!

19:15.188 --> 19:17.324
GIBBONS:
As soon as everyone is seated

19:17.357 --> 19:19.392
we can begin
the hearings again.
No, we can't!

19:19.426 --> 19:21.528
Hey! It was
Pierce and Stewart!

19:21.561 --> 19:22.729
SABRINA: Expel them both!
CHIP: They did it!

19:22.762 --> 19:24.063
Not me!
Gone!

19:24.096 --> 19:25.732
It was Stewart.
No, no, it was Pierce.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.733
SABRINA:
I want them out of here!

19:26.766 --> 19:28.167
Screw you, dude.
SABRINA:
Get them!

19:28.201 --> 19:29.168
I didn't do it!

19:29.202 --> 19:30.870
(all shouting, arguing)

19:30.903 --> 19:32.239
Leave!
(people shouting)

19:37.043 --> 19:38.845
Now, you remember what
I told you, Benito?

19:38.878 --> 19:41.748
That minivans are for
soccer moms and pedophiles.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.749
No, the other thing.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.883
That I can never

19:43.916 --> 19:45.017
tell anyone about this.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.018
That's right.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.587
I'm not a snitch.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.188
I know...

19:49.222 --> 19:50.990
but I'm gonna need you
to prove it.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.393
Torch that son of a bitch.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.862
Okay.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.370
Okay.
(speaks Spanish)

20:03.403 --> 20:05.705
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.375
Good.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.709
Good boy.

20:12.245 --> 20:15.047
Whoa. Okay.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.916
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.218
You know, Benito,

20:19.252 --> 20:24.023
if anyone ever messes with you,
like a teacher or a coach,

20:24.056 --> 20:25.124
then you can snitch, okay?

20:25.157 --> 20:26.393
Okay.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.461
Good boy.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.597
(sighs)
I like fire.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.799
I know you do, Benito.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.934
I know you do.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.947
What'd everybody do today?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.385
Nothing.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.454
Yeah. Very boring day.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.256
Yeah.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.427
Hey.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.495
How'd your first game
on varsity go?

21:02.529 --> 21:03.896
How do you think it went?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.666
Thanks to me, we had all
our best players expelled.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.781
Real weird energy
in here today, huh?

Beaver Dog!

21:43.370 --> 21:45.037
Now that you've gotten
to know The Mick,
