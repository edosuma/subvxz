WEBVTT

00:00.553 --> 00:01.778
He-Man.

00:01.819 --> 00:06.078
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.978
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.020 --> 00:09.139
Defender of the

00:09.164 --> 00:11.378
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.420 --> 00:15.544
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.586 --> 00:17.444
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.469 --> 00:19.578
to me the day I held aloft

00:19.620 --> 00:21.754
my magic sword and said,

00:21.779 --> 00:24.268
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.020 --> 00:31.178
I have the power!

00:38.386 --> 00:39.513
Cringer became the

00:39.538 --> 00:41.578
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:41.620 --> 00:43.476
He-Man, the most

00:43.501 --> 00:46.002
powerful man in the universe.

00:48.886 --> 00:51.378
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.220 --> 00:54.451
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.476 --> 00:56.511
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.535 --> 00:59.188
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.213 --> 01:01.717
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:33.862 --> 01:35.664
Thank you for coming so
quickly, Your Majesty.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.098
You said it was, urgent?

01:42.448 --> 01:44.750
Where are we going, Duncan?
The energizer chamber.

01:51.031 --> 01:54.637
Ah! I haven't been down
here since I was a boy.

01:54.662 --> 01:57.048
There's been no need for
anyone to come down here.

01:57.626 --> 01:59.212
But there is now.

01:59.637 --> 02:01.961
Eternium, the most powerful
substance on the planet.

02:01.986 --> 02:05.391
This one piece has supplied all our
power, for centuries.

02:08.934 --> 02:10.448
Duncan, what happened?

02:10.473 --> 02:12.674
It's energy is almost used up.

02:12.888 --> 02:14.859
If that rock goes,

02:14.884 --> 02:16.916
everything on the planet
will come to a stop.

02:17.517 --> 02:18.974
Everything but Skeletor,

02:18.999 --> 02:20.578
he'd just walk in and take over.

02:21.110 --> 02:22.709
We need a new piece of Eternium.

02:22.734 --> 02:23.908
It won't be that easy.

02:23.933 --> 02:26.070
Eternium is nearly impossible to find.

02:30.472 --> 02:31.792
Hey, what happened? The light...

02:36.626 --> 02:37.845
It's getting worse.

02:37.870 --> 02:39.330
We need a replacement

02:39.355 --> 02:40.466
And very soon!

02:53.037 --> 02:54.682
That's it Burbie,
just a little higher.

02:55.607 --> 02:56.897
Okay, right there!

02:56.922 --> 02:57.995
Now get out of the way.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.728
Let's see if I my aim is any better today.

03:06.366 --> 03:07.756
Ah! Missed again.

03:08.781 --> 03:11.209
Hey there child, why the long face?

03:12.198 --> 03:14.163
It's the Scatter Ray.

03:14.188 --> 03:15.773
How am I ever gonna join the Royal

03:15.798 --> 03:17.202
Guard if I can't aim straight?

03:17.901 --> 03:20.278
Maybe you aren't cut out to be a soldier.

03:20.303 --> 03:22.056
Why is it so important to you?

03:23.089 --> 03:25.853
C'mon Grandpa,
you've seen He-Man and Teela.

03:25.878 --> 03:28.090
Why, I want to fight evil like they do!

03:30.399 --> 03:32.726
Just think,
I mean zoomin' around in a

03:32.751 --> 03:35.411
Sky-Sled.
Havin' all those powerful weapons,

03:35.436 --> 03:37.540
Goin' up against Skeletor's warriors.

03:37.765 --> 03:39.809
Ah, that's what I call fun!

03:43.962 --> 03:45.374
Don't be so sure, child.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.077
Fighting is something horrible.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.509
It's not the fun and games,
you make it out to be.

03:49.921 --> 03:51.655
When people fight,

03:51.680 --> 03:52.781
people get hurt.

03:53.706 --> 03:56.262
Don't you think you'd feel
differently if... well I...

03:56.287 --> 03:58.274
I mean, if you could... walk?

03:59.067 --> 04:01.386
You know, you've never asked me
why I can't walk.

04:01.411 --> 04:02.945
I was afraid to ask.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.056
And I didn't tell you
because you were too young.

04:05.764 --> 04:07.018
But now that you're old enough,

04:07.043 --> 04:08.377
maybe you should hear about it.

04:09.923 --> 04:10.923
What is it, Burbie?

04:12.566 --> 04:14.475
By the Sands of Time!

04:14.900 --> 04:18.007
I'd never dreamed I would actually see it.
What is it?

04:18.279 --> 04:20.264
You just found a piece of Eternium.

04:24.838 --> 04:27.517
Good news Duncan.
I've just received a Telebeam

04:27.542 --> 04:28.926
from an old friend of mine,

04:28.951 --> 04:30.147
in the Sands of Time.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.535
His grandson found some Eternium.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.391
Thank heavens!
We can tell

04:34.416 --> 04:35.836
the energy patrol to stop looking.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.671
First, we better send
Teela, to guard that rock.

04:38.696 --> 04:39.828
Right away, Your Majesty!

04:45.297 --> 04:47.717
This is all your fault, Trap Jaw.

04:48.042 --> 04:49.985
Skeletor wouldn't have made us stay

04:50.010 --> 04:51.660
here watching his screen,

04:51.685 --> 04:54.324
if you hadn't crashed his Doom Buster.

04:55.055 --> 04:56.952
Ah, stop gurgling in my ear.

04:56.977 --> 04:58.218
It was your seaweed that

04:58.243 --> 04:59.720
gummed up the controls.

05:00.917 --> 05:03.272
What's that?
Eternium,

05:03.297 --> 05:05.406
the pieces were being
lost in the Sands of Time.

05:06.918 --> 05:10.907
Let's take it for ourselves.
Panthor, bring us the key.

05:13.932 --> 05:14.932
We don't need a key.

05:19.826 --> 05:21.975
Oh, why didn't you do that before?

05:23.776 --> 05:26.132
I like eating between meals.

05:26.157 --> 05:28.062
C'mon, let's get that Eternium!

05:36.302 --> 05:38.605
Teela ought to be here pretty soon.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.421
Teela? She's coming here?!

05:41.085 --> 05:43.780
Didn't I tell you,
King Randor is sending her to escort us.

05:44.755 --> 05:46.275
You mean I get to meet her?

05:46.300 --> 05:48.269
Well,
I suppose if you wanted to.

05:48.709 --> 05:51.119
Grandpa...
Of course you can meet her, Chad.

05:51.144 --> 05:52.697
Did ya hear that, Burbie?

05:52.722 --> 05:54.150
We get to meet Teela!

06:00.462 --> 06:03.854
Look, the Eternium is right down there.

06:04.279 --> 06:06.560
Yeah, and no one to stop us but a

06:06.585 --> 06:08.252
boy and an old man in a jet chair.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.199
This'll be easier than I thought.

06:12.856 --> 06:15.143
Hey look, is that Teela?
Chad, quick...

06:15.168 --> 06:16.933
hand me the Scatter Ray
and the Force Shield.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.678
But you don't know
how to use them ?!

06:18.703 --> 06:20.774
Not now, Chad,
just give them to me.

06:25.809 --> 06:27.063
We'll take that rock.

06:29.438 --> 06:31.665
It is ours,
now leave us in peace.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.052
Let's freeze them Mer-Man!

06:38.433 --> 06:39.433
Grandpa!

06:39.491 --> 06:41.967
Wow, I didn't know you
could handle a shield

06:41.992 --> 06:43.535
like that. Let's just

06:43.560 --> 06:45.472
see how strong their weapons are.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.691
Yikes! He's too good with that thing.

06:50.165 --> 06:51.165
I don't believe it.

06:51.199 --> 06:53.108
Why, you're the best shot I've ever seen!

06:53.509 --> 06:55.176
There's a leak over there, get one

06:55.201 --> 06:56.963
o' them water creatures you control.

06:57.192 --> 06:58.192
Yes.

07:00.666 --> 07:04.128
Arise from the depths to obey your master.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.081
Blast him grandpa!

07:14.106 --> 07:15.908
No, I will not use this

07:15.933 --> 07:17.241
on any living thing.

07:17.266 --> 07:19.030
We've gotta do something!

07:19.438 --> 07:20.638
Let's try and get out of here.

07:20.663 --> 07:21.903
That's your department, Chad!

07:24.914 --> 07:25.993
After them!

07:27.666 --> 07:28.673
What's wrong?

07:28.698 --> 07:31.117
You're seaweed gummed
up the controls again.

07:35.234 --> 07:36.969
Honestly, Adam, I don't know

07:36.994 --> 07:38.085
why my father wanted all

07:38.110 --> 07:39.141
of you to come with me.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.651
Me neither.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.299
Hey, what's that up there? I'll look.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
Uh-oh.

07:48.559 --> 07:50.606
It's a man and a boy,
they're in trouble.

07:51.831 --> 07:54.614
Trouble for them
means trouble for me.

07:55.153 --> 07:56.153
Hang on.

08:03.032 --> 08:04.036
This will be dangerous,

08:04.061 --> 08:05.588
so I want you three to wait here.

08:07.889 --> 08:09.498
With pleasure!

08:12.185 --> 08:14.399
By the power of Grayskull!

08:21.424 --> 08:24.495
I have the power!

08:38.028 --> 08:39.028
Wait for me!

08:47.752 --> 08:49.751
Grandpa please, use the Ray.

08:50.076 --> 08:52.239
I-I can't do it.

08:52.264 --> 08:53.982
Maybe I can scare the monster off.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.480
Hang on.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.147
It's Teela and He-Man too!

09:07.171 --> 09:09.552
Need a hand?
Wow, I don't believe it.

09:11.821 --> 09:14.180
I think it's my turn to stop this creature,

09:14.205 --> 09:15.595
and your turn to help the people.

09:15.930 --> 09:16.930
You got it!

09:22.084 --> 09:23.929
Keep your legs to yourself,

09:23.954 --> 09:25.183
all six of them.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.914
Come on, you'll be safer over there.

09:33.499 --> 09:35.736
Teela, could you put your
finger here for a second?

09:38.306 --> 09:40.847
That should hold you long
enough for us to be on our way.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.106
Where's that monster?
Lemme at 'em.

09:44.131 --> 09:45.565
You're a little late, Orko.

09:46.531 --> 09:48.420
Not to mention you were
supposed to wait in the

09:48.445 --> 09:49.511
Wind Raider.

09:49.536 --> 09:51.045
Now where's Adam?

09:54.203 --> 09:56.678
He wasn't himself.
In other words,

09:56.703 --> 09:57.732
he panicked and went back

09:57.757 --> 09:58.990
for help in the Wind Raider.

09:59.259 --> 10:01.556
Oh I wouldn't say that.
But I think we better

10:01.581 --> 10:03.569
get out of here before
our "friend" gets loose.

10:04.211 --> 10:06.439
And before Mer-Man
and Trap Jaw catch up.

10:06.464 --> 10:07.736
So they're behind this?

10:10.476 --> 10:12.434
We'll be ready if they show up again.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.711
Uh oh .. Now what?

10:16.136 --> 10:17.489
I'm getting a distress

10:17.514 --> 10:19.265
call from my Spidasaur.

10:19.516 --> 10:22.040
That old man and boy
couldn't beat that thing.

10:22.365 --> 10:23.785
Turn around, turn around!

10:23.810 --> 10:25.342
It was He-Man who did it.

10:28.581 --> 10:30.677
Now we'll never
get the Eternium.

10:31.302 --> 10:32.640
We were so close...

10:32.665 --> 10:34.496
I could almost taste it.

10:34.905 --> 10:36.946
Taste it? Hmm.. I wonder.

10:36.971 --> 10:39.029
Eternium is the most powerful

10:39.054 --> 10:41.315
substance on the planet.
So?

10:41.340 --> 10:43.053
Suppose I ate some of it.

10:43.903 --> 10:45.561
Why would you do that?

10:45.586 --> 10:48.576
Well, if I ate it,
it might make me...

10:48.601 --> 10:50.377
It would make you, as

10:50.402 --> 10:52.176
powerful as, He-Man!

10:52.803 --> 10:55.813
Right! Then I'll show
He-Man a thing or two.

10:57.009 --> 10:58.718
And the rest of Eternia, too.

10:59.043 --> 11:00.516
Come on, Mer-Man,

11:00.541 --> 11:03.833
it's time for my lunch: of Eternium.

11:10.667 --> 11:11.944
I guess we won't have any more

11:11.969 --> 11:13.380
trouble from Trap Jaw and Mer-Man.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.349
Don't be so sure, Chad.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.249
We still got a long way to go.

11:17.483 --> 11:18.971
And it's not like Skeletor's

11:18.996 --> 11:20.696
warriors to give up so easily.

11:20.997 --> 11:22.785
Nice Fuzz Bee, how 'bout a bone?

11:27.403 --> 11:29.518
What's your Fuzz Bee's name?
Burbie.

11:29.743 --> 11:31.569
Grandpa and I
found him as a pup.

11:31.594 --> 11:33.644
He's my best friend in the whole world.

11:34.538 --> 11:35.853
How about a little sip of water?

11:37.580 --> 11:38.580
Uh, whoops!

11:38.656 --> 11:39.842
I think I overdid it.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.672
Just a little slip of the hat.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.164
You're a funny magician.

11:45.589 --> 11:48.409
Hmm... let's just say, he's funny.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.054
I wish they'd hurry.

12:05.279 --> 12:07.312
It's too dry for me here.

12:07.945 --> 12:10.105
Quit whining,
you seafaring sissy.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.033
Here they come.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.008
I'll lower you with my Dropper.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.695
Then you grab the Eternium.

12:14.751 --> 12:16.284
And I'll grab you back up.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.319
You better make
this worth my while.

12:20.344 --> 12:22.317
I told you,
when I eat that rock,

12:22.518 --> 12:25.338
I'll make 1/3rd of the
planet into an ocean.

12:28.365 --> 12:31.734
Wait a minute,
you said 2/3rd's before.

12:31.759 --> 12:33.460
Is that right? Ha Ha...

12:34.301 --> 12:36.202
Why, you double crossin...

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
Whoa!

12:50.920 --> 12:51.920
Woaow!

12:56.603 --> 12:58.630
No wonder it's called, the Dropper.

12:58.655 --> 12:59.747
Did you hear something?

13:00.262 --> 13:02.132
Yes, and something tells me

13:02.157 --> 13:03.485
it's Trap Jaw and Mer-Man.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.722
Now my only hope is.. is this Grabber.

13:10.460 --> 13:11.493
Hey!

13:11.517 --> 13:13.992
He-Man, Teela, look,
it's Trap Jaw!

13:14.840 --> 13:15.932
I'll take care of him.

13:26.158 --> 13:28.390
At last,
one of my devices worked.

13:28.915 --> 13:30.081
Now to become,

13:30.106 --> 13:32.104
as powerful as He-Man!

13:35.160 --> 13:36.160
Uh oh.

13:37.953 --> 13:40.573
I can feel it, it...
It's working!

13:41.798 --> 13:43.555
It's a long way down.

13:43.780 --> 13:46.194
Will it be the easy way
or the hard way?

13:46.502 --> 13:47.828
Not so fast He-Man,

13:48.253 --> 13:50.834
this time,
I'm as strong as you are.

13:53.880 --> 13:54.880
Oh no.

13:59.140 --> 14:01.079
I guess this means the hard way!

14:24.283 --> 14:26.893
He-Man, are you alright?
Yes, but Trap Jaw..

14:26.918 --> 14:29.527
ate some Eternium.
It's given him incredible power.

14:32.785 --> 14:33.822
Catch, He-Man!

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
Yeaow-ow-w!

14:39.460 --> 14:41.811
It's Mer-Man! I'll handle him.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.280
Oh.

14:48.049 --> 14:50.516
I should have stayed in Snake Mountain.

14:52.814 --> 14:54.199
Let me help you, He-Man.

14:54.224 --> 14:56.011
I'll use my Ray if I have to.

14:56.805 --> 14:58.819
No,
I know how you feel about it.

14:58.844 --> 14:59.876
Out of my way!

15:04.954 --> 15:06.549
That will teach you
to be so "grabby"!

15:07.245 --> 15:08.617
I'm through playing, He-Man.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.899
I used to make the same mistake myself.

15:17.024 --> 15:18.660
That's showing him, He-Man.

15:20.037 --> 15:21.959
What's that? Sounds like our

15:21.984 --> 15:23.431
"friend", is eating his way out.

15:27.164 --> 15:29.088
Even you can't stop me, He-Man.

15:33.962 --> 15:35.145
It's wearing off!

15:35.170 --> 15:36.296
I'm losing my power...

15:39.474 --> 15:40.815
I need more Eternium.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.160
No!

15:53.378 --> 15:54.465
Burbie, don't eat it!

16:01.354 --> 16:02.994
Burbie, you're sick.

16:03.019 --> 16:04.458
Oh Burbie.

16:04.483 --> 16:05.879
Only magical creatures like

16:05.904 --> 16:07.196
Trap Jaw can eat rocks.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.571
You can eat all the rocks
you want in the prison mines.

16:14.363 --> 16:16.455
Teela, take care of him.

16:16.780 --> 16:18.406
A Porta-Prison should hold him.

16:21.270 --> 16:24.319
He-Man, it's Burbie.
He's real sick.

16:24.544 --> 16:26.622
I think he might be dying.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.572
I may know someone who can help him.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.294
By the power of Grayskull,

16:41.519 --> 16:44.052
I command the Jawbridge,

16:44.077 --> 16:45.187
Open!

16:49.480 --> 16:50.480
You wait here.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.273
It's too late for my magic to help him.

17:00.531 --> 17:01.930
What about the chamber of life?

17:02.155 --> 17:04.500
A mortal will have to take
him inside the chamber.

17:05.286 --> 17:06.637
It's magic is too dangerous,

17:06.663 --> 17:07.869
and I can't control it.

17:08.705 --> 17:11.318
Open the Chamber, Sorceress.
Very well, He-Man.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.107
Hang on, Burbie.

17:29.926 --> 17:32.710
I'd give anything if
this had never happened.

17:32.735 --> 17:34.610
You and Burbie were very brave,

17:34.635 --> 17:35.905
like real soldiers.

17:36.646 --> 17:38.719
I never thought
Burbie could get hurt.

17:38.744 --> 17:40.178
I know how you feel, Chad.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.870
I used to be a soldier.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.897
You?

17:43.922 --> 17:45.729
So you weren't always in a Jet Chair?

17:46.094 --> 17:49.014
No, many years ago I could walk,

17:49.039 --> 17:51.866
run, play ball just like you.

17:51.951 --> 17:53.023
What happened then?

17:53.148 --> 17:55.346
Well, it was near the
end of the Ork war.

17:57.518 --> 17:59.419
I was a young soldier,
stationed in a mining

17:59.444 --> 18:00.825
camp, in the Sands Of Time.

18:01.437 --> 18:03.325
A group of Orks was
attacking the camp.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.997
I was on patrol nearby and
came to defend the miners.

18:06.881 --> 18:08.228
I was good with the Scatter Ray

18:08.253 --> 18:10.078
and this was the moment
I've been waiting for.

18:10.516 --> 18:11.553
I fired at the Orks,

18:14.821 --> 18:15.827
My rays missed,

18:15.852 --> 18:17.299
but the Orks were frightened off.

18:17.774 --> 18:19.998
I was rather pleased with
myself, until...

18:20.023 --> 18:21.160
I heard the rumbling.

18:26.413 --> 18:28.833
My fancy shooting had loosened the cliff.

18:32.435 --> 18:33.696
The mountain fell on top of us.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.195
Later, I pulled myself
out of the rubble, my legs...

18:38.220 --> 18:40.207
were paralyzed,
I would never walk again.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.730
But I was one of the lucky ones.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.028
Many didn't come out at all.

18:44.866 --> 18:46.000
Anyway, I swore...

18:46.025 --> 18:47.563
never to use the Scatter Ray again.

18:48.219 --> 18:49.715
Grandpa, I had no idea...

18:49.740 --> 18:51.474
But that's all in the past.

18:52.142 --> 18:53.963
Right now,
it's Burbie that I'm worried about.

18:54.588 --> 18:56.235
He-Man's been gone a long time.

18:56.850 --> 18:57.869
Here he comes.

19:08.697 --> 19:11.583
Burbie, you're okay.
Alright!

19:11.903 --> 19:12.903
Good as new.

19:13.371 --> 19:14.371
Oh, Burbie.

19:14.782 --> 19:16.361
He-Man, you saved him!

19:16.386 --> 19:17.797
Thank you, He-Man!

19:17.822 --> 19:19.430
How can we ever repay you?

19:20.101 --> 19:21.204
Wouldn't happen to have any

19:21.229 --> 19:22.396
Eternium on you, would you?

19:22.621 --> 19:25.130
As a matter of fact,
I did pick up a few pieces.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.921
You did?  That's terrific.

19:29.030 --> 19:31.327
What good will little pieces do you?
Watch!

19:35.696 --> 19:37.899
You're sqeezing them into one big rock!

19:39.176 --> 19:42.427
Here it is, enough to power
Eternia for a long, long time.

19:42.989 --> 19:44.158
Let's get it to the palace.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.473
Good idea. Your grandpa tells
me you want to be a soldier.

19:49.186 --> 19:50.186
I did.

19:50.187 --> 19:52.410
I mean, I thought it
was all fun and games,

19:52.435 --> 19:53.933
but now I'm not so sure.

19:54.771 --> 19:56.809
People get hurt when they fight.

19:56.834 --> 19:57.980
You bet they do.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.759
It could be you,

19:59.784 --> 20:01.605
or even someone you love.

20:01.630 --> 20:02.791
Like Burbie?
Yes

20:03.690 --> 20:04.754
or your grandpa.

20:04.779 --> 20:07.171
Fighting... didn't turn
out to be much fun for him.

20:07.738 --> 20:08.738
Yeah.

20:09.244 --> 20:11.002
It's something to thinking
about, Chad.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.412
But if you still decide
you want to join the Guard,

20:13.770 --> 20:15.052
I'll put in a good word for you.

20:15.577 --> 20:18.530
Wow,
a recommendation from He-Man!

20:18.702 --> 20:19.769
Let's get going.

20:29.316 --> 20:31.303
Sometimes movies and television adventure

20:31.328 --> 20:33.384
series like this one make it seem as though

20:33.409 --> 20:35.137
shooting a gun, fighting, and taking

20:35.162 --> 20:37.169
chances are fun and exciting things to do.

20:38.110 --> 20:39.378
And what's more, the good guys

20:39.403 --> 20:41.291
never get hurt.
But in real life,

20:41.316 --> 20:43.156
people do get hurt, even killed,

20:43.181 --> 20:44.324
when they fight or use guns.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.896
Make believe can be fun,
and there's nothing

20:46.921 --> 20:48.462
wrong with imagining great adventures.

20:48.634 --> 20:49.672
But never forget,

20:49.697 --> 20:51.084
that when it's the real thing,

20:51.185 --> 20:52.779
someone can get hurt.

20:52.804 --> 20:54.095
Even the good guys.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.182
Even you.
