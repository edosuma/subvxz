WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:05.222
We do have solid evidence.

00:05.266 --> 00:07.181
We have Ms. Johnson's DNA

00:07.224 --> 00:09.444
at the scene
and on Oscar Brown's body.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.204
The foster mother's DNA
on the foster child's body.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.013
That's solid?

00:13.056 --> 00:15.015
She's with him every day.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.929
Anthony, why are you
trying to unravel this?

00:16.973 --> 00:19.628
I'm not, but why would
one of the other foster kids

00:19.671 --> 00:21.804
give Ms. Johnson an alibi?

00:21.847 --> 00:24.241
Why say he was with
her if he wasn't?

00:24.285 --> 00:26.896
I'm sorry, but the word of
a 16-year-old does not hold up

00:26.939 --> 00:28.637
against solid forensic evidence.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.073
It just doesn't add up.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.075
She's been fostering kids
for decades.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.382
Why kill one now? You know why.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.906
Because Oscar Brown had
severe disabilities.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.386
She was way in over her head.

00:38.429 --> 00:41.737
She cracked. That's why.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.086
A.D.A. Reagan.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.044
Sir.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.219
Thank you for the good work

00:45.262 --> 00:47.264
you've been doing
on the Brown case.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.483
Thank you.

00:48.526 --> 00:49.919
We're all good?

00:49.962 --> 00:51.094
90% there.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.095
Poor child, left alone

00:52.139 --> 00:53.357
to die in a dumpster.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.358
There's only one way
this is gonna go, right?

00:54.402 --> 00:55.751
I don't take any case lightly,

00:55.794 --> 00:58.232
let alone one involving a child.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.320
Which is why

00:59.363 --> 01:00.843
I was hesitant
to give this to you,

01:00.886 --> 01:03.106
because you do have a habit
of fixing things

01:03.150 --> 01:04.325
that aren't broken.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.109
Well, no one said
it's broke, but I think...

01:06.153 --> 01:08.720
We will be proceeding
to the grand jury as planned.

01:08.764 --> 01:09.939
Good.

01:09.982 --> 01:12.159
Bring it on home.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.554
I'm gonna go talk to this kid.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.034
Why would you do that?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.209
To make sure it ain'tbroke.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.776
You just heard him. Look,

01:20.819 --> 01:23.909
if Judith Johnson really did
this, then the kid is lying.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.869
It's only right
that we find out why.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.357
Hold up.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.638
Man, I told you
I didn't do nothing.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.099
Take your hands
out of your pockets

01:39.142 --> 01:41.275
and keep 'em
where we can see 'em.

01:41.318 --> 01:44.452
Got anything on you?
Turn around.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.499
I'm on him! I got your six.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.854
Police! Stop right there!

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.363 --> 02:27.756
Police!

02:27.799 --> 02:29.279
Don't move.

02:29.323 --> 02:30.604
Take your hands
out of your pockets,

02:30.628 --> 02:31.779
keep them where I can see them.

02:31.803 --> 02:32.761
Where's your partner?

02:32.804 --> 02:34.980
Right behind me.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.112
Doesn't look like it.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.896
Drop the knife.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.463
Drop the knife.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.991
Drop the knife now.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.908
Down on the ground now.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.433
Face down, arms out. Let's go.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.308
Sorry.

03:06.664 --> 03:11.103
What? I'm here, and you're fine.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.586
Officer Witten was fine.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.109
No thanks to her partner.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.416
Who's not fine is about
half the rank and file.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.897
There's a pretty loud call for
a yearly physical fitness exam

03:21.940 --> 03:23.725
so they don't end up
in a similar situation.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.727
Or else.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.424
Or else? Not-so-veiled threats to leak

03:27.468 --> 03:31.123
the body cam footage straight
to the press if nothing changes.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.276
But can you blame them? It's not
exactly safe to have a cop

03:33.300 --> 03:35.215
who can't climb
a few flights of stairs.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.086
That was, like, a dozen flights.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.130
It was four.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.393
Let's not start fat-shaming.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.656
Fat-shaming? Yeah, it's a thing.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.527
I know that,
but I didn't know you knew that.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.268
I've been a big guy
my whole life,

03:45.312 --> 03:47.227
and it's never made me
any less of a cop.

03:47.270 --> 03:51.013
All right? Physical fitness does
not make a guy do a good job.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.232
What are you talking about?

03:52.275 --> 03:53.818
Being a police officer
is a physical job.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.539
Yeah, and physical
comes in all sizes!

03:55.583 --> 03:58.194
And they're not equal. I lost
50 pounds since September,

03:58.238 --> 03:59.282
and it's changed my life.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.936
And, yes, for the better.

04:00.979 --> 04:03.243
Wow, I had no idea you lost
that much. Good for you.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.332
I get it, you see me every day,
it's hard to tell.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.029
Sorry, did we hurt
your feelings?

04:07.072 --> 04:09.031
Okay.

04:09.074 --> 04:12.034
Thank you.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.516
So, Slim, what's your point?

04:17.168 --> 04:19.519
I'm off my cholesterol meds,
blood pressure's down,

04:19.563 --> 04:22.174
and I have more energy
than I've had in years.

04:22.218 --> 04:25.439
And if I'm a cop,
I'm a more effective cop.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.789
At what?
Investigating the salad bar?

04:27.832 --> 04:30.661
At backing up an Officer Witten.

04:33.708 --> 04:34.752
Boss, would you tell him?

04:34.796 --> 04:36.232
Tell him what?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.061
Good cops come
in all shapes and sizes.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.672
Good cops come in all shapes
and sizes.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.414
Except grossly out of shape.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.852
Talk to the unions, take their
temperature on where they stand

04:47.896 --> 04:50.333
on a physical standard for cops.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.770
But a lot of guys would
not pass a tough physical.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.772
I know that. I know that, Sid.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.993
And it's a big consideration.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.822
But I can't unsee
what I watched.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.914
Caller said to look
into a William Sloan.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.700
Who calls about a murder
from over a decade ago?

05:09.744 --> 05:10.851
Apparently,
the victim's sister's

05:10.875 --> 05:12.268
been calling in for years.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.270
It's a slow day,
I figured let's have some fun.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.924
That's your idea of fun?

05:15.967 --> 05:18.709
Sloan's listed here
as the only suspect.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.450
So why wasn't he collared
for it back then?

05:20.494 --> 05:22.844
I don't know. I mean,
there's not much of a case here.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.020
It seems the investigation
just fell off.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.283
Well, who was the lucky idiot
that caught the case?

05:27.327 --> 05:30.025
"Detect..."

05:30.068 --> 05:31.940
What?

05:31.983 --> 05:33.463
Who is it?

05:33.507 --> 05:35.509
Actually, you know what?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.815
I just lost my appetite
for cold cases.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.034
No... wait...

05:41.428 --> 05:44.735
"Detective Sid Gormley."

06:11.806 --> 06:14.417
Hey, Sarge. What's up?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.593
I heard Leary transferred
out of our house.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.615
Yeah, requested to be
transferred to Fleet Services

06:18.639 --> 06:20.118
after the incident with Witten.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.077
Officer Witten's
without a partner now?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.295
That's right.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.514
Coincidentally, so am I.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.733
Whoa, you want me

06:25.776 --> 06:27.778
to partner you
with Officer Witten?

06:27.822 --> 06:30.128
Why not? She's a rookie.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.715
I was gonna partner you
with Rodriguez or Tupper.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.131
Somebody more on your level.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.177
Were you aware that Maya and I
were one of, like,

06:35.220 --> 06:38.093
a hundred female partners
in the NYPD?

06:38.136 --> 06:40.225
I didn't know that
very specific statistic, no.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.663
You know how many male
partnerships there are?

06:43.490 --> 06:44.534
Over 8,000.

06:44.578 --> 06:45.970
What else don't I know?

06:46.014 --> 06:47.885
That maybe I could teach
Witten a thing or two.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.887
All due respect
to my father's judgment,

06:49.931 --> 06:52.107
Witten seems to have a knack
for attracting problems.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.326
Okay, so let me respect
your father's judgment.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.764
He clearly sees
potential in her.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.418
And I'd like another shot

06:58.461 --> 07:00.637
at teaming
with a female partner.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.424
Just think about it.

07:07.165 --> 07:11.082
So how long you been under
Ms. Johnson's foster care?

07:11.126 --> 07:14.172
Since I was 14,
so almost two years.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.000
And where you staying now?

07:16.044 --> 07:18.525
I don't know.
They're taking me tonight.

07:18.568 --> 07:21.005
You like living
in Ms. Johnson's home? Yeah.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.572
She was cool.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.768
Some boys liked to call her Mom.
She was warm like that,

07:24.792 --> 07:26.097
but I already got a mom.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.012
But she's in jail.Yeah.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.361
For 16 years.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.538
And she went in
right after you were born?

07:31.581 --> 07:34.932
No, I was,
I was born in that prison.

07:37.587 --> 07:40.111
You said that you
and Ms. Johnson,

07:40.155 --> 07:43.027
were at the movies between
800 and 1000 the night of.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.028
Yeah.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.943
What movie? Avengers.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.554
The latest one. Where at?

07:47.597 --> 07:49.556
AMC, 124th Street.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.471
What time? 755.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.081
You got proof?

07:53.124 --> 07:54.517
I mean, anyone else with you?

07:54.561 --> 07:56.606
You take a selfie there
with Ms. Johnson?

07:56.650 --> 07:58.695
Just me and her.
No, why would I do that?

07:58.739 --> 08:00.131
It was just a movie.

08:00.175 --> 08:04.919
And when you got home,
Oscar was missing.

08:04.962 --> 08:08.879
Yeah. She called 911 right away,
and that's that.

08:11.534 --> 08:16.104
Sam, Ms. Johnson's gonna
be charged with murder.

08:16.147 --> 08:19.107
So if you got any proof that
she couldn't have done this,

08:19.150 --> 08:21.936
I suggest you tell me now.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.329
She didn't do it.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.549
And I got to do my homework.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.554
Okay, well,

08:31.598 --> 08:35.297
if you remember anything,
you let me know.

08:45.612 --> 08:46.743
Hey.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.353
Thanks for coming, boss.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.746
Good man.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.531
What are we drinking to?

08:51.574 --> 08:53.924
I never knew you
to need an excuse.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.970
Fair enough.

08:58.015 --> 09:01.671
You sure you're not loosening me
up so I share all my secrets?

09:01.715 --> 09:03.325
Well, I did have a question.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.326
Of course you did.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.328
Cold case came across my desk.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.504
The name William Sloan
ring a bell?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.245
Yeah, sure, why do you ask?

09:10.288 --> 09:12.290
Do you remember
why you didn't like him

09:12.334 --> 09:13.901
for the Caroline Russo murder?

09:13.944 --> 09:17.426
Boy, wow, you're asking
a lot of an old man's memory.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.428
I know.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.822
I think he had an alibi,
for starters.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.040
He did, yeah.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.825
So what's the problem?

09:24.868 --> 09:29.264
There's no problem,
I just was clearing things up.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.310
You looking into my cases?

09:32.354 --> 09:33.790
You know me
better than that, boss.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.532
A cold case comes across
my desk, I got to take a look.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.231
Then do me a favor,
leave it alone.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.519
You can't just
retroactively change

09:47.543 --> 09:49.545
the collective
bargaining agreement.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.026
And, no, not even him.

09:53.375 --> 09:56.073
Johnny, we're just talking.
No one's making threats.

09:56.117 --> 09:59.294
I know him. He walks softly
and carries a big stick.

09:59.337 --> 10:03.167
I'm sure you realize that if we
require better physical health

10:03.211 --> 10:05.909
from our officers,
your union benefits.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.737
And why is that? Health care costs go down,

10:07.781 --> 10:09.304
your kitty goes up.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.915
List of illnesses
can be prevented

10:11.959 --> 10:13.134
by better physical fitness.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.657
So?

10:14.701 --> 10:16.572
So that's fewer prescriptions

10:16.616 --> 10:18.356
your health plan
wouldn't have to cover.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.880
I don't need your statistics.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.509
You don't need to save money
for the union?

10:21.533 --> 10:23.666
What I need to save is
my officers' jobs.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.234
Johnny, we're not looking
to put anyone out of work.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.670
That would be the result.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.387
Look, I'll put up posters
of the food pyramid.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.282
I'll organize 5k runs,

10:31.326 --> 10:32.588
whatever you like.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.808
I will not do anything
that affects

10:34.851 --> 10:36.244
the livelihood of our officers.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.289
No one cares about the
livelihood of our officers

10:38.333 --> 10:39.682
more than me.

10:39.726 --> 10:40.901
So prove it.

10:42.337 --> 10:45.122
I don't need
to prove anything to you. To them.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.168
To the cops.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.649
Back off.
The-the NYPD is some kind of.

10:49.692 --> 10:50.843
Miss America contest
all of a sudden.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.323
That's a load of crap
and you know it.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.784
Come on, Johnny, you know
we need you on board here.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.265
Nobody has their trust,
has their ears the way you do.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.354
And I am not gonna
betray that trust

10:59.397 --> 11:02.183
for some New Age-y wellness BS.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.924
Sorry.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.890
That went well.

11:16.588 --> 11:17.894
Great. I'll see you there.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.593
What was that about? Thanks.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.379
She's in a fraternal
organization I joined

11:24.422 --> 11:26.424
called "A Squad of Our
Own." What's that?

11:26.468 --> 11:27.774
Putting together teams

11:27.817 --> 11:29.297
and schedules for
female officers.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.647
So far, we have softball,
basketball, soccer.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.929
Thought only the guys had that.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.302
Which is why it got started.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.304
It's like
a female empowerment thing?

11:36.347 --> 11:37.348
God, I hope not.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.916
Then what? More like a...

11:39.960 --> 11:41.831
"why should the guys be
the only ones

11:41.875 --> 11:44.225
"that get to get sweaty,
then have beers

11:44.268 --> 11:46.444
"and hit on cute bartenders
after the game" thing.

11:46.488 --> 11:47.271
That's a good thing.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.708
You play anything?

11:48.751 --> 11:51.101
I played softball all the way
through high school.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.060
Softball practice
is Tuesdays and Thursdays.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.322
I'm a pitcher.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.498
I play a mean shortstop.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.935
The one we have lacks
a certain killer's instinct.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.415
You interested?

12:01.459 --> 12:02.373
Yeah.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.027
Okay.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.725
You want to drive?

12:05.768 --> 12:07.901
I'll ride shotgun
and take the next tour.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.337
Sounds like a plan.

12:09.380 --> 12:12.122
What the hell happened?
It's on me, I can explain.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.950
I see. You're delayed
because of this guy.

12:13.994 --> 12:16.668
I gave him 24 hours to check all the
boxes... I think there's another

12:16.692 --> 12:18.365
foster kid who has more to tell.
And time's up.

12:18.389 --> 12:19.826
So we're ready to move on.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.871
Good. Is that all right
with you, Detective?

12:21.915 --> 12:23.960
I'm just crossing T's
and dotting I's.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.527
Consider it done. But it's not done.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.398
Hey, I just said it was.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.681
Are you running a railroad
here? 'Cause that's what I see.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.272
You want to talk your way
out of a job?

12:31.315 --> 12:33.230
Can we just step back, please?

12:36.799 --> 12:38.409
You need to sit your man down

12:38.453 --> 12:40.237
and explain to him...

12:40.281 --> 12:41.475
Anthony is
a very committed detective,

12:41.499 --> 12:43.414
which makes him
one of the best we've got.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.374
Please.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.248
You are racking up the IOUs,
A.D.A. Reagan.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.556
There will be no more surprises
on this one, I promise.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.340
Bring me charges.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.476
Do the job
that you are paid for.

13:04.392 --> 13:05.959
Are you kidding me?

13:06.002 --> 13:08.352
I should be asking you
that question.

13:21.496 --> 13:24.064
So how'd it go
with Officer Witten?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.674
I like her.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.850
Like her how? What do you mean?

13:27.894 --> 13:29.852
As a cop, as a person? Both.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.768
She gets involved,
she puts herself out there.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.726
Out there how?

13:34.770 --> 13:36.424
What's with the third degree?

13:36.467 --> 13:37.860
Wow.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
Make his a double.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.472
Whatever IPA you have
on tap, please.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.517
Same.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.735
You're right, sorry.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.086
I got handed her
by my dad like a hot potato

13:46.129 --> 13:48.001
after he canned her

13:48.044 --> 13:50.873
for obvious profiling
and then changed his mind.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.068
Next thing I know, she's getting.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.528
Leary off the beat, so...

13:53.571 --> 13:55.791
She didn't get Leary anything.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.185
She seems like a trouble magnet.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.882
She's not.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.364
Out there and involved how? Well, she helps

14:03.407 --> 14:06.802
put together these female
officer sports teams.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.238
Like a female empowerment thing?

14:09.718 --> 14:12.852
No, like an after-work
sports thing.

14:12.895 --> 14:16.507
And I'm trying out
for shortstop.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.554
Bad idea.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.818
I'm a really great shortstop,
thank you very much.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.603
No, I mean, that's not
what those clubs are about.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.779
They're all about networking

14:27.823 --> 14:29.781
and back-scratching
and trying to find

14:29.825 --> 14:31.194
hooks with higher-ups. Well, this one's

14:31.218 --> 14:33.350
about getting sweaty
and going out

14:33.394 --> 14:35.396
for beers together afterwards. No, Eddie,

14:35.439 --> 14:37.528
they're all fronts for agendas.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.444
You're about to become
a Reagan, it's a no-go.

14:41.489 --> 14:42.925
Seriously?

14:42.969 --> 14:44.057
Yeah.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.015
I mean, don't take it
the wrong way.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.906
People like you for you,
but you're about to become

14:47.930 --> 14:51.107
the daughter-in-law of the PC.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.327
And the former PC.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.957
You're gonna have to accept
that some people

14:54.981 --> 14:56.286
are gonna try to use you.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.722
To do what?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.899
Win a women's softball game?

14:59.942 --> 15:01.944
Now you're just being stubborn.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.772
No, you know what I'm being?

15:03.815 --> 15:06.601
I'm being, like,

15:06.644 --> 15:08.908
astonished that my fiancé
is trying to tell me

15:08.951 --> 15:10.735
what I can and I cannot do.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.141
Let me guess.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.187
Lieutenant Gormley
told you to stay out of it.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.840
Something like that.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.949
And you were just like,
"Okay, we'll stay out of it"?

15:30.973 --> 15:32.496
No, there is definitely

15:32.540 --> 15:34.281
something shady going on.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.978
You know, our former boss
has a new boss

15:36.022 --> 15:38.372
who happens to be my old man,
in case you didn't know.

15:38.415 --> 15:39.808
Yeah, I'm well aware of that.

15:39.851 --> 15:40.983
Okay, so what are you doing?

15:41.027 --> 15:42.767
Looking for the truth.

15:42.811 --> 15:45.596
What if we don't like
the truth that we discover?

15:45.640 --> 15:47.859
Sloan was living a double life.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.775
One as the lover to the victim
Caroline Russo

15:50.819 --> 15:53.387
and one as a married ATF agent.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.999
Sloan was working for ATF?

15:57.043 --> 15:58.696
Still is.

15:58.740 --> 16:02.744
Gormley spent years
working in Narcotics.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.006
Yeah, I know.

16:04.050 --> 16:07.749
And Narcotics
works closely with ATF.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.230
So you're suggesting
that Gormley may have been

16:10.273 --> 16:12.014
covering up
for this Sloan character?

16:12.058 --> 16:14.103
There's only one way
to find out.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.285
Well, you're the one that said
you wanted to have some fun.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.941
It's not my idea of fun anymore.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.335
Have a seat.

16:32.339 --> 16:35.298
Great job out there.
Thanks. You, too.

16:35.342 --> 16:38.084
So, we'll see you at practice?

16:38.127 --> 16:39.868
I'm sorry, I-I can't.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.522
What do you mean? I thought...

16:41.565 --> 16:43.524
I'm just, I'm not
much of a joiner.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.093
Sounded like you liked
playing softball.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.572
I do, I did.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.010
I haven't played in a long
time, actually, though.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.359
So...

16:52.402 --> 16:54.056
Right, okay.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.015
Thanks for the invite.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.973
Sure. Eddie.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.630
Is it 'cause of me?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.022
Is what?

17:04.066 --> 17:06.068
I'm not deaf or blind.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.028
I know there's people blaming me
for Leary getting bounced out.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.049
Not me... Leary has got no one
to blame but himself.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.683
That and beer and pizza
and doughnuts.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.468
Yeah, well...

17:14.511 --> 17:16.383
i-if you want me to put in

17:16.425 --> 17:18.079
for a new partner, I'm happy to.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.820
Well, I don't.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.084
You change your mind, I'm cool.

17:22.127 --> 17:25.827
Rachel, I'm not gonna
change my mind.

17:25.869 --> 17:28.047
I'm just not much of a joiner.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.789
See you tomorrow.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.932
Sam, what are you doing?

17:43.975 --> 17:45.499
It's freezing out here.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.979
Got locked out. So call 'em up.

17:48.023 --> 17:50.721
Your, your foster parents.
I did.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.375
I keep getting voice mail.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.555
You want to go get a cup
of coffee or something?

17:58.599 --> 18:00.316
No, I don't want to miss
when she comes back.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.516
I got homework.

18:05.693 --> 18:06.955
Here.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.913
What's this?

18:08.957 --> 18:11.133
It's a ticket stub
from the movie that night.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.743
Just the one?

18:12.787 --> 18:14.484
Yeah.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.747
Look, I wasn't lying.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.532
I... I did go.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.751
But I went by myself.

18:23.754 --> 18:28.237
Look, she was,
she was really good to me.

18:28.281 --> 18:31.153
And I really don't want her
to go to prison.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.589
But...

18:32.633 --> 18:35.288
Even more than that,

18:35.331 --> 18:36.811
I-I want to be the first person

18:36.854 --> 18:39.161
in my family not
to go to prison.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.381
What would you go
to prison for, Sam?

18:41.424 --> 18:44.340
Lying to law enforcement,
false witnessing, I don't know.

18:44.384 --> 18:47.038
So you're saying
you have no idea

18:47.082 --> 18:49.563
what Ms. Johnson
was doing that night?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.391
No, sir. I don't.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.699
I only said I did 'cause
I didn't want to move again.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.614
It was a good home.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.185
Sam?

19:03.229 --> 19:05.796
Sam, get over here.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.624
There she is.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.715
Grab some of these.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.674
I got to go. Make yourself useful.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.726
William Sloan?

19:22.770 --> 19:25.425
I'm Detective Baez, this is
my partner Detective Reagan.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.600
And what can I do for you?

19:26.643 --> 19:27.881
Just want to ask you
a few questions.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.777
Yeah, su...
A-anything, Detectives.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.735
Have a, have a seat.

19:33.781 --> 19:34.999
You've been working with

19:35.043 --> 19:37.045
the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms

19:37.088 --> 19:39.700
for almost 20 years? Yeah, that's correct.

19:39.743 --> 19:42.485
Back in 2009,
almost ten years ago,

19:42.529 --> 19:44.183
what was your position
with the agency?

19:45.488 --> 19:47.142
2009.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.622
This about Caroline?

19:48.665 --> 19:50.841
You know something about that?
Let me guess.

19:50.885 --> 19:53.005
Her sister Lorraine's been
banging on your door again.

19:53.844 --> 19:56.107
Look, I've tried for years

19:56.151 --> 19:57.108
to move on.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.719
It was not a good time for me.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.155
Not a good time how?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.201
Well, I lost the love
of my life.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.724
But you were

20:03.767 --> 20:04.875
married at the time, correct?

20:04.899 --> 20:07.510
No, I was separated.
Since divorced.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.818
And Caroline was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.689
Her death was the worst.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.038
So how come you're not spending

20:14.082 --> 20:16.171
every waking moment
trying to find her killer?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.869
I guess I gave up hope. Why do you suppose

20:18.913 --> 20:21.350
her sister's so convinced
it was you?

20:21.394 --> 20:23.396
I don't know.
You know, people mourn

20:23.439 --> 20:24.982
in all kinds
of different ways, I guess.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.529
I'm-I'm an open book,
Detectives.

20:27.617 --> 20:28.836
Um...

20:28.879 --> 20:31.273
what exactly do you do here?

20:31.317 --> 20:32.753
Exactly what it looks like I do.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.668
I sit behind this desk, I...

20:34.711 --> 20:36.278
check and recheck forms all day.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.367
And you've always sat
behind the desk? Yeah.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.369
I know it's not flashy
and impressive

20:40.413 --> 20:41.868
like what you guys do,
but I actually enjoy

20:41.892 --> 20:44.721
the administrative work. You
work closely with the NYPD?

20:44.765 --> 20:46.767
No.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.690
No, that doesn't really come
with the territory.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.772
Do you have any
friends in the NYPD?

20:52.816 --> 20:53.948
No.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.778
Sorry, I'm at a loss here,
Detectives.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.432
What's that got to do
with Caroline?

20:59.475 --> 21:00.824
Nothing, honestly.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.870
Hope we didn't waste your time.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.703
A PD in Colorado has had a test

21:09.746 --> 21:11.942
like the one we're talking about
for the last two years,

21:11.966 --> 21:14.490
and they've seen marked
reductions in sick days

21:14.534 --> 21:15.752
and medical claims.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.364
And by their metrics,
even a lower crime rate

21:18.407 --> 21:21.236
due to a more proactive police
presence across the board.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.324
Win-win.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.717
How many failed the test?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.501
Almost 40%.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.069
An obstacle, I know.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.810
More like an iceberg.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.769
That ratio holds,
we're out 15,000 cops.

21:33.030 --> 21:33.988
You're late.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.032
But prepared.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.512
Read 'em and weep.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.951
That's every cop,
detective, sergeant,

21:40.995 --> 21:42.997
and lieutenant who wouldn't pass

21:43.040 --> 21:44.433
the proposed fitness exam.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.957
How can you know when
they haven't taken the exam?

21:47.001 --> 21:49.873
Eyeballing. Every single one
of these guys

21:49.917 --> 21:52.441
very likely would
end up out of a job.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.313
You know how many
lives they saved,

21:54.356 --> 21:55.792
murders they solved?

21:55.836 --> 21:57.074
I'm guessing
you're gonna tell us.

21:57.098 --> 21:58.969
It's right there, all listed.

21:59.013 --> 22:03.147
Wow, I think this is the hardest
you've ever worked.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.951
You think you're better at your
job 'cause you lost 50 pounds?

22:04.975 --> 22:07.195
'Cause I ain't seeing it. Cut it out.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.719
Both of you.

22:11.199 --> 22:11.939
He started it.

22:11.982 --> 22:13.593
Sit down, Sid.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.553
We have not made a decision.

22:17.597 --> 22:21.165
That's why we're here,
to look at all sides.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.602
And you brought us one of them.

22:22.645 --> 22:26.170
My side has the unions on it.
That's one big fat side.

22:26.214 --> 22:28.999
No pun intended.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.698
You know what, go down to one
of those fancy-ass gyms,

22:31.741 --> 22:33.700
grab every meathead
in the joint,

22:33.743 --> 22:36.006
put 'em in a uniform
and out in the street,

22:36.050 --> 22:38.182
and see what happens. That's
not what this is about.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.184
This is a bad idea, boss.

22:40.228 --> 22:44.101
It's not a bad idea...
or a good idea.

22:44.145 --> 22:47.540
It's just an idea
whose time has come.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.586
And it arrived on that
rooftop the other day

22:50.630 --> 22:52.980
gasping for air,
sweating bullets,

22:53.023 --> 22:55.548
50 pounds overweight.

22:55.591 --> 22:58.028
And wearing our uniform.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.437
The kid was fibbing.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.700
You mean the kid lied
to investigators?

23:17.744 --> 23:19.746
He wasn't with her the night of.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.182
And?

23:21.225 --> 23:24.707
My gut said he knew something.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.187
I was wrong.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.799
So that's it?
I'm free to move on?

23:29.843 --> 23:31.148
You always were.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.628
Thanks for giving me the leeway.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.152
I'll apologize to the D.A.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.633
You know, it's
a good day, Anthony.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.592
We're doing what
we advertise we do.

23:39.635 --> 23:40.786
We're putting the killer away.

23:40.810 --> 23:43.465
Yeah. Yay.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.511
What?

23:47.948 --> 23:51.691
You should see what we
do to these kids, Erin.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.475
You know, they sent
Sam to a home

23:53.519 --> 23:57.392
where they kept him
locked out for hours?

23:57.436 --> 23:59.786
But apparently there's
no other place for him

23:59.829 --> 24:00.961
in the foster system.

24:01.004 --> 24:04.791
We didn't do that.
You didn't lock him out.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.271
Yeah, I know.

24:09.273 --> 24:12.755
I think it might be time that
you step down from this case.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.322
That's not necessary.

24:16.498 --> 24:17.934
I wasn't asking.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.085
I hear you two are still
digging into my case.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.695
What, you don't
trust me, Reagan?

24:39.739 --> 24:42.742
Come on, boss, I never thought
for a second you was crooked.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.744
And now we know it.
It all checked out.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.267
You checked up on me?

24:46.310 --> 24:48.574
I did.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.663
And what if I was
covering up for the guy?

24:50.706 --> 24:53.970
Then you know
how the story goes.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.276
Sorry, boss.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.802
I'm the one who owes you
an apology.

24:59.846 --> 25:02.413
Why is that?

25:02.457 --> 25:07.549
That case happened during one
of the worst years of my life.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.377
My marriage was breaking up,

25:09.420 --> 25:11.945
I was knee-deep in debt.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.861
I know a couple of cases must
have fell through the cracks.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.926
Why didn't you just tell me
that in the first place?

25:16.950 --> 25:19.474
Because I was embarrassed
that you would solve it

25:19.518 --> 25:21.171
so easily when I couldn't.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.999
Not that easily;
We still don't have

25:23.043 --> 25:24.435
anything solid on Sloan.

25:24.479 --> 25:26.089
No, we don't.What I should have done

25:26.133 --> 25:27.787
was just help you guys out,

25:27.830 --> 25:29.702
which is what I want to do now.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.661
Great. Be our guest.

25:45.892 --> 25:49.896
I bagged on the softball team,
like you told me to.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.289
I didn't tell you to, I asked.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.856
Rachel Witten thought
it was about her,

25:53.900 --> 25:56.206
thought that cops were
lining up against her

25:56.250 --> 25:59.166
'cause Leary got fired
for being fat.

25:59.209 --> 26:02.430
I'm gonna clear that up
with the whole squad.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.084
You know,
the last partner I had,

26:04.127 --> 26:06.323
she kept secrets from me, and
that didn't turn out so great.

26:06.347 --> 26:07.914
I wasn't asking you
to keep secrets,

26:07.957 --> 26:09.568
just not to go joining
any organizations

26:09.611 --> 26:11.633
on account of the fact that...
I'm gonna be a Reagan?

26:11.657 --> 26:13.180
Yeah, like I said,
it comes with...

26:13.223 --> 26:15.356
You know, I need to know
what else I need to know.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.706
Family dinner.
What gets you excused?

26:17.750 --> 26:20.013
Gunshot wound?

26:20.056 --> 26:22.885
Fever of 104?
Is there a list somewhere?

26:22.929 --> 26:24.844
Are we talking, or are
we just talking smack?

26:24.887 --> 26:26.561
You guys all belong
to fraternal organizations

26:26.585 --> 26:28.021
in the department,
so what gives?

26:28.064 --> 26:29.718
Is it 'cause I'm female?

26:29.762 --> 26:31.827
We belong to the ancient ones,
Eddie, it's not the same thing.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.959
What about when we get married?
Am I expected to retire?

26:33.983 --> 26:35.352
You're expected to do
what you want to do.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.030
On what? Which things?

26:37.073 --> 26:39.162
Is there a list? Cut it out.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.774
Rachel Witten was hurt.
I could see it.

26:41.817 --> 26:42.925
And the only way
that you can make amends

26:42.949 --> 26:45.342
is by playing shortstop
on her club?

26:45.386 --> 26:46.387
Eddie, come on.

26:59.052 --> 27:02.316
I'm off the case, Sam.

27:02.359 --> 27:03.902
So, if you got anything
you want to say,

27:03.926 --> 27:04.884
I got to refer you to...

27:04.927 --> 27:08.061
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.932
I feel bad about lying to you.

27:09.976 --> 27:13.109
You came all this way
just to say you're sorry?

27:13.153 --> 27:16.504
I got locked out again.

27:16.547 --> 27:19.725
All right, come on in.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.128
Why won't she let
you have a key?

27:32.172 --> 27:34.435
Because I'm 16.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.263
She says she don't want
no 16-year-old

27:36.306 --> 27:37.586
coming and going like he please.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.920
What's in this?

27:40.963 --> 27:42.922
Bucatini with Sunday sauce.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.880
What's Sunday sauce?

27:44.924 --> 27:48.579
Garlic, oil, good tomatoes,
some chopped up onions.

27:48.623 --> 27:51.060
This is delicious,
and I hate onions.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.409
They cook down.

27:52.453 --> 27:53.560
You don't even know
they're in there.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.631
Meatballs.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.504
Sweet sausage, but the kind
without the fennel seeds.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.897
What's fennel seeds?

28:01.941 --> 28:05.292
Tastes kind of like licorice.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.728
Overwhelms the other flavors.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.861
Who wants licorice
on their noodles?

28:08.904 --> 28:10.079
On their pasta.

28:10.123 --> 28:12.691
And my point exactly.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.835
I'm just seeing this now.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.489
It's a mock-up.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.752
It's also bound to happen. Not bound.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.034
Well, more than likely at best.

28:32.058 --> 28:35.235
Look, I get it, slim.
It's important to you.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.106
It's important to you, too.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.152
You're as vain about the
department as he ever was.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.544
Not vain.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.468
Proud. Protective.
Whatever you want to call it.

28:42.503 --> 28:45.419
We can't do it if
Johnny Lyons is against it.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.421
Sure we can.
You're the police commissioner.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.597
Yeah, then I'd be
the police commissioner

28:49.640 --> 28:50.816
of a fractured rank and file.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.166
I will not do that. Then what?

28:54.820 --> 28:57.474
Maybe it's not
a "what" question.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.041
Maybe it's a "who" question.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.390
Yeah, I got it.

29:00.434 --> 29:03.045
You believe this guy Sloan?

29:03.089 --> 29:04.588
He's still got three people
claiming they were with him

29:04.612 --> 29:05.918
the night of the murder.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.721
And another 12 listed
as character witnesses,

29:07.746 --> 29:09.399
all sticking to their
side of the story.

29:09.443 --> 29:12.881
Who the hell lists a dozen
character witnesses anyway?

29:12.925 --> 29:14.274
Someone trying
to cover their ass.

29:14.317 --> 29:16.058
Wait a second.

29:16.102 --> 29:18.017
What do you got, boss?

29:18.060 --> 29:21.020
We have 15 people here with
one big thing in common.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.848
Crappy taste in friends?

29:22.891 --> 29:27.069
And they all hold
federal firearms licenses.

29:27.113 --> 29:30.290
You think this somehow
connects back to Sloan?

29:30.333 --> 29:32.814
Sloan's been working at
the ATF for decades, right?

29:32.858 --> 29:33.815
Doing what?

29:33.859 --> 29:35.382
Paperwork. Nothing fancy.

29:35.425 --> 29:39.603
All 15 of these people need
their FFLs to conduct business.

29:39.647 --> 29:43.825
And what better place to get
those than from an ATF agent?

29:43.869 --> 29:45.958
Sloan bribed them for his alibi.

29:48.525 --> 29:49.875
Once a detective.

29:49.918 --> 29:53.008
Let's bring him in.

29:53.052 --> 29:55.706
Danny. Yeah?

29:55.750 --> 29:58.448
You planted that for him
in plain sight, didn't you?

29:58.492 --> 30:00.842
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.149
You're telling me that
Lieutenant Gormley

30:03.192 --> 30:05.978
just happened to stumble upon
this groundbreaking connection,

30:06.021 --> 30:07.021
and you didn't?

30:18.991 --> 30:21.776
No, I've been single
since I lost Caroline.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.171
Women, you can't live
with 'em...

30:25.214 --> 30:26.975
You know, I think the phrase
should end right there.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.696
No.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.220
You know, it wasn't like that
with Caroline, though.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.787
She never gave me any issues.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.397
Never? No.

30:34.441 --> 30:37.923
Come on. Really.
She was a saint.

30:37.966 --> 30:40.664
You must have fought sometimes.Never.

30:40.708 --> 30:43.145
Wow.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.626
My wife and I at the time, boy,

30:45.669 --> 30:46.908
we were going through
some rough stuff.

30:46.932 --> 30:49.848
I'm sorry to hear that.
Don't be.

30:49.891 --> 30:52.546
You didn't forget her birthday
three years in a row.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.028
But then we went
to this great therapist.

30:56.071 --> 30:59.466
Yeah, he really
helped us through it.

30:59.509 --> 31:00.684
That's great.

31:00.728 --> 31:02.904
Yeah, he was great.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.993
He was recommended to us
by another cop,

31:05.037 --> 31:07.778
Officer Lou Simon.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.780
Real sensitive guy, you know.

31:09.824 --> 31:10.999
Always talked things out.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.132
He's retired now.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.742
I reached out to him recently,

31:14.785 --> 31:17.876
you know, with
all this happening.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.312
You know him?

31:19.355 --> 31:22.445
No, don't know him. That's funny

31:22.489 --> 31:25.274
'cause he says he knows you.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.581
Says he recommended
the very same couples shrink.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.675
All right, so Caroline and I
had some issues.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.720
I thought you never fought?

31:36.764 --> 31:40.072
Well, I prefer to think of them
as disagreements.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.726
And was it a disagreement
that led you

31:42.770 --> 31:45.120
to take a 2x4 to her skull?

31:54.129 --> 31:57.263
She wanted you
to leave your wife.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.919
And I was going to.

32:03.269 --> 32:04.879
She wouldn't listen.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.273
Women.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.057
They never listen.

32:15.237 --> 32:17.979
Help me help you.

32:30.731 --> 32:33.255
Nice work. Yeah, little rusty.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.910
You still got it.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.651
And, Danny. Yeah?

32:37.694 --> 32:40.001
Thanks for teeing up
that evidence for me.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.484
What...

32:49.750 --> 32:52.753
Judith Johnson was indicted
for murder this morning.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.363
Congratulations.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.802
How's Sam doing?

32:58.846 --> 33:00.804
How should I know?

33:00.848 --> 33:02.981
Just a feeling.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.722
You threw me off the case,

33:05.766 --> 33:08.073
and he wasn't part of the case
after he fessed up.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.510
Again, how's Sam doing?

33:12.555 --> 33:14.079
He's gonna be okay.

33:14.122 --> 33:15.384
With your help?

33:15.428 --> 33:18.866
We're gonna sign papers
later today.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.563
Gonna foster Sam myself.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.044
Anthony, what're you doing?

33:23.088 --> 33:26.656
I'm helping a kid out.
Show me the law against it.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.355
There isn't one. He's almost 17.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.052
So throw him a party.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.620
At 17 and a half,
he can take the NYPD exam.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.230
It doesn't make it a smart move.

33:35.274 --> 33:38.059
At 18, he could join
the armed services

33:38.103 --> 33:41.802
and gain credit towards
the Academy's requirements.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.456
That's the deal we made.

33:45.501 --> 33:49.984
It's not like I always
wanted a son, but...

33:50.028 --> 33:53.379
one came knocking
and I answered the door.

34:07.697 --> 34:11.875
Friend and I had the same
conversation hundreds of times,

34:11.918 --> 34:14.313
except with us, it was about
her going back to work.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.924
You didn't want her to?

34:16.967 --> 34:20.449
I thought that's what I wanted.

34:20.493 --> 34:24.888
But if we were gonna be happy,
she had to be happy,

34:24.931 --> 34:26.585
and that's what I really wanted.

34:26.629 --> 34:30.458
Well, Jamie and me,
it's not about me working.

34:30.503 --> 34:35.029
No, but it is about
the same stubbornness

34:35.072 --> 34:37.248
that is inherent
in the Reagan DNA.

34:40.947 --> 34:43.994
Do you know how
our brother Joe died?

34:46.040 --> 34:47.998
I've heard stories.

34:48.042 --> 34:51.437
He joined an NYPD
fraternal organization

34:51.480 --> 34:53.178
called the Blue Templar.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.834
Jamie never talks
about that part.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.141
With good reason.

35:00.185 --> 35:03.797
The Blue Templar was supposed
to police the police.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.453
Things changed,
they got rotten, and...

35:07.496 --> 35:10.195
when Joe got close to naming
names, they killed him.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.633
They tried to kill Jamie, too.

35:13.676 --> 35:15.809
Yeah, they did.

35:18.855 --> 35:22.685
So when my kid brother gets
to believing something,

35:22.729 --> 35:26.602
even a superstition,
which this is,

35:26.646 --> 35:29.823
his pylons get sunk deep.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.132
How do I talk to him?

35:36.177 --> 35:39.093
I listened to him,

35:39.137 --> 35:42.183
maybe he'll listen to me.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.403
With your permission, of course.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.929
Dinner's ready.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.149
Let me know.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.023
No bacon?

35:56.066 --> 35:58.504
That's just a green salad, Pop.

35:58.547 --> 36:00.114
Yeah, but bacon
livens up a salad.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.551
Bacon makes everything better.

36:02.595 --> 36:03.944
We've got fried chicken

36:03.987 --> 36:05.772
and cheddar biscuits
and mac and cheese

36:05.815 --> 36:06.966
and you're missing the bacon?

36:06.990 --> 36:10.211
So? So, rule number nine to live by,

36:10.255 --> 36:12.387
you can eat whatever
you want as long as it has

36:12.431 --> 36:13.997
a green salad
next to it... Yeah.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.173
Not french fries.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.132
You should put that
in the Patrol Guide.

36:18.176 --> 36:22.441
Really? It's reached
the D.A.'s office?

36:23.703 --> 36:25.139
What's reached where?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.837
Anthony got wind of it,
so you can imagine his reaction.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.361
I can.

36:29.404 --> 36:31.426
There's talk of a physical
standard for cops' fitness,

36:31.450 --> 36:32.973
like a test.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.670
Also known as discrimination.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.194
Come on, Pop.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.370
Jack Axelrod, my chief of D's...

36:38.413 --> 36:39.545
Yeah.

36:39.588 --> 36:41.982
He closed his weight
in major cases.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.898
And bought the farm before
he reached retirement age.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.073
Okay, I'll give you that.

36:46.116 --> 36:48.206
But he would've been
a great loss

36:48.249 --> 36:50.599
if I'd had to fire him
because he was husky.

36:50.643 --> 36:51.644
Husky.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.428
Exactly how fat is husky?

36:53.472 --> 36:58.041
I'm not talking about
Navy SEAL shape, Pop,

36:58.085 --> 37:00.696
but being able to run up
a few flights of stairs,

37:00.740 --> 37:01.958
you bet.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.047
You're trapped in a fire
on the third floor,

37:04.091 --> 37:05.895
you're praying that the
firefighters can run up there.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.182
It's the same thing.Exactly.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.464
Well, you're preaching
to the choir here,

37:09.488 --> 37:10.924
but how do you legislate that?

37:10.967 --> 37:13.492
It's just setting
a minimum standard.

37:13.535 --> 37:16.669
I know, but what if you got
one cop who's quick on his feet,

37:16.712 --> 37:18.366
but then there's
another cop who,

37:18.410 --> 37:20.368
when she pulls up
to a crime in progress,

37:20.412 --> 37:22.732
she's got, like, X-ray vision,
but then you got another cop

37:22.762 --> 37:24.677
who can disarm
and defuse a standoff

37:24.720 --> 37:27.506
like he's singing a lullaby.
I mean, which one of those cops

37:27.549 --> 37:30.291
would we want to lose
because they're out of shape?

37:30.335 --> 37:34.164
I hate to admit it,
but he has a point.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.298
It becomes a slippery slope.

37:37.342 --> 37:40.127
No, no, no. Danny hit it
right on the nose.

37:41.389 --> 37:43.391
In a perfect world,
all three of those cops

37:43.435 --> 37:46.002
could run up a flight of stairs
and climb over a fence.

37:46.046 --> 37:47.371
And when you find
the perfect world,

37:47.395 --> 37:50.180
please send me the address.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.626
Union President Lyons.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.455
If this is about
the beauty contest,

38:03.498 --> 38:05.674
you're wasting
your time and mine.

38:05.718 --> 38:08.547
Well, it is and it isn't.

38:08.590 --> 38:09.939
You can't have it both ways.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.681
Neither can you. You lost me.

38:12.725 --> 38:15.641
If you think I want to fire
one single cop,

38:15.684 --> 38:17.469
the answer is no, never.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.688
I've done enough of that
to last me ten lifetimes.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.342
So what do you want?

38:21.386 --> 38:23.257
For my cops to succeed.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.911
Sounds like we want
the same thing.

38:24.954 --> 38:27.696
Good.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.624
What the hell?

38:42.668 --> 38:44.931
You knew you couldn't
climb the career ladder

38:44.974 --> 38:47.455
carrying all that lard.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.544
Some might call that
hypocritical.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.851
I sure do. Where'd you get this?

38:51.894 --> 38:53.635
You did a pretty good job
of scrubbing,

38:53.679 --> 38:55.289
but you missed a few
from the '90s

38:55.333 --> 38:56.788
during your time
with the Baltimore PD.

38:56.812 --> 38:58.684
Doesn't matter what I did.

38:58.727 --> 39:02.775
And what did you do, Johnny?
What do you call it?

39:02.818 --> 39:05.647
Gastric bypass? Cosmetic surgery?

39:05.691 --> 39:07.954
More than just a tummy tuck.

39:07.997 --> 39:11.392
I mean, imagine if that got out.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.699
I mean, it's not like

39:13.742 --> 39:15.527
you even sweated off
the extra weight,

39:15.570 --> 39:17.529
disciplined yourself,
set an example.

39:17.572 --> 39:18.878
You took the shortcut.

39:18.921 --> 39:21.837
The rank and file
is gonna eat you for lunch.

39:21.881 --> 39:25.667
Not if this exam puts those
same officers out of the job.

39:29.628 --> 39:32.500
For every officer
currently on the job,

39:32.544 --> 39:33.893
the exam will be optional.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.721
So why would anyone take it?

39:35.764 --> 39:37.002
Because you're gonna
offer them cuts

39:37.026 --> 39:38.854
on their insurance co-pays
if they do.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.117
Come on. And from now on,

39:41.161 --> 39:45.818
new NYPD contracts will contain
a mandatory evaluation.

39:47.167 --> 39:50.692
I scheduled a joint press
conference in half an hour.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.872
What am I supposed
to tell recruits?

39:56.916 --> 40:00.354
That, together,

40:00.398 --> 40:02.400
we just raised the bar.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.190
So when's the first game?

40:10.233 --> 40:13.149
Saturday versus Women's
Correction Officers.

40:13.193 --> 40:15.151
I bet they're good with a bat.

40:15.195 --> 40:17.676
We'll find out.

40:17.719 --> 40:20.679
Officer Janko?

40:20.722 --> 40:22.942
I'll meet up with you.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.686
So my brother talked to you.

40:27.729 --> 40:30.253
Yeah. And he said
he'd talk to me.

40:30.297 --> 40:32.865
He asked permission, actually.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.475
Well, he did.

40:36.912 --> 40:39.828
Sometimes I'm gonna
have things to say to you

40:39.872 --> 40:42.396
that I need to preface
with, "If I were you..."

40:42.440 --> 40:44.703
Okay.

40:44.746 --> 40:47.532
Things like, "If I
were you, I'd slow down."

40:47.575 --> 40:49.229
If I were you, I'd think twice."

40:49.272 --> 40:53.102
Like that, instead of just,
"Slow down, think twice."

40:56.410 --> 40:59.631
So maybe if I forget sometimes,

40:59.674 --> 41:01.284
you can remind me.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.551
What I should've said is,

41:06.594 --> 41:09.336
"If I were you,
I wouldn't go joining

41:09.379 --> 41:11.338
any fraternal organizations."

41:11.381 --> 41:14.907
But I know that I'm not you,

41:14.950 --> 41:17.431
only you're you.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.612
Okay.

41:26.658 --> 41:29.443
So, Janko...

41:31.880 --> 41:34.274
be careful out there.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.235
Thanks, Sarge.
