um, but due to, like,
scheduling and stuff,

08:27.606 --> 08:29.775
uh, it didn't work out
until this season,

08:29.775 --> 08:32.111
<i> but I still think
everything happens
for a reason,</i>

08:32.111 --> 08:34.613

this season--</i>

08:34.613 --> 08:37.550

that we didn't have,</i>

08:37.550 --> 08:39.318

Colleen Ballinger
was our disco dancer,

08:42.755 --> 08:44.790
<i> and she's such
a beautiful woman,</i>

08:44.790 --> 08:47.092
<i> and putting her
in this disco outfit</i>

08:47.092 --> 08:49.295
<i> felt like the right place
for her to live,</i>

08:49.295 --> 08:50.629
<i> and also the right energy,</i>

08:50.629 --> 08:52.965
<i> this sort of carefree energy</i>

08:52.965 --> 08:55.200
that can turn on a moment
and snap.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.670
I didn't know that she
was so competitive,

08:57.670 --> 09:01.106
but it was so funny
to slowly see her, like,

09:01.106 --> 09:03.976
<i> unravel how competitive
she was.</i>

09:03.976 --> 09:06.145
<i> Um, you could definitely
see that
in the Jenga challenge.</i>

09:06.145 --> 09:08.981
<i> She was just getting
so frustrated with us.</i>

09:08.981 --> 09:10.749
I was like,
"I will just kill myself

09:10.749 --> 09:12.318
just for this game
to be over."

09:12.318 --> 09:14.186
Like, I was so annoyed
at Jenga.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.322
I was like, "Why are we playing
Jenga for seven hours?"

09:16.322 --> 09:18.791
When she felt like somebody
wasn't standing up
for themselves,

09:18.791 --> 09:21.760
or wasn't doing enough,
boy, she got on them about it.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.163
<i> When she was upset with Joey,
she drove it into the ground.</i>

09:24.163 --> 09:26.198

09:26.198 --> 09:28.033

09:28.033 --> 09:29.668

09:29.668 --> 09:31.070
Colleen and I kind of, like,

09:31.070 --> 09:33.372
built up this, like, drama
between the two of us,

09:33.372 --> 09:36.308
<i> but obviously, like,
we're still good friends.</i>

09:36.308 --> 09:38.344
<i> Like, it was all
just for show</i>

09:38.344 --> 09:40.145
<i> and, like, behind the scenes,
we were totally like,</i>

09:40.145 --> 09:41.780
<i> "How can we, like, spice up</i>

09:41.780 --> 09:43.248

09:43.248 --> 09:46.318
Um, so it was all just, like,
fun and games.

09:46.318 --> 09:49.054
I'm, like, the least
confrontational person
on the planet,

09:49.054 --> 09:50.289
so to play that
was really fun,

09:50.289 --> 09:52.157
- 'cause I would,
in real life...
- Yeah.

09:52.157 --> 09:53.158
- You'd be shaking.
- That would give me

09:53.158 --> 09:55.060

- You'd be over--

- I would--I'd be a mess.

would never do."
