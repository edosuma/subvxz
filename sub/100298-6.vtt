00:00.584 --> 00:02.169
<i>Previously on</i>
Party of Five...

00:02.169 --> 00:03.962
Valentina:
Emilio, Lucia,
something's happening!

00:03.962 --> 00:05.380
‐I think he's having a seizure.
‐He's shaking.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.632
Valentina:
Emilio, help him!

00:06.632 --> 00:08.050
Rafa has lead poisoning.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.384
Well, what are
my options?

00:09.801 --> 00:11.220
‐And don't say‐‐
‐DACA.

00:11.220 --> 00:11.970
No, Lucia.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.848
That's dangerous for me
in a totally different way.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.683
I just want everyone
to be safe!

00:19.186 --> 00:20.604
Valentina:
<i>That girl has two mothers,</i>

00:20.604 --> 00:22.439
two, and I don't
even have one.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.817
<i>I'd like to maybe try dancing.</i>

00:25.817 --> 00:27.402
Do you think I'll be
any good at it?

00:27.402 --> 00:29.029
I think you'll be great.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.989
The welfare of these children
is your responsibility,

00:30.989 --> 00:32.032
but now it's mine too.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.242
I don't understand.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.117
A file's been opened.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.202
I'm your case manager now.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.870
I don't have time

00:37.538 --> 00:38.914
to get good
at parenting, Val.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.000
I need to be good
at it now.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.299
Well, I don't understand,
they're just getting rid of it?

00:49.299 --> 00:51.510
My stepmom's
on a cleaning kick.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.720
She's tossing any items
that brought my dad joy

00:53.720 --> 00:54.930
before she came
into the picture.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.391
So... yes? You want it?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.059
Are you kidding?
Of course. Yes!

00:59.059 --> 01:00.644
Beto. Where would we
even put it?

01:00.644 --> 01:02.187
We'll make room, okay?

01:02.521 --> 01:03.563
Don't listen to her.

01:04.273 --> 01:05.023
You're amazing,
you know that?

01:09.778 --> 01:11.238
Matthew:
What are you doing
over here by yourself?

01:11.989 --> 01:14.908
Trying not to ruin my appetite
by watching those two make out.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.245
Who's Amanda Davis?

01:21.164 --> 01:22.082
Is she a friend?

01:23.250 --> 01:25.085
‐You got a crush?
‐No.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.046
I just like that name.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.761
Amanda Davis is a girl
with a pool.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.264
Someone who rides horses.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.266
Amanda... travels a lot?

01:39.850 --> 01:40.892
Definitely.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.395
I kinda think I'm more
of an Amanda.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.441
Is that terrible?

01:49.067 --> 01:51.778
It's weird that
parents get to decide

01:51.778 --> 01:53.697
something so important
about you

01:53.697 --> 01:55.615
without asking, you know?

01:56.575 --> 01:57.909
Without knowing
who you really are.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.787
One hundred percent.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.831
Waiter:
Have you folks decided?

02:02.831 --> 02:03.915
Um...

02:04.666 --> 02:06.168
I'll have
the shrimp diablo.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.462
May I recommended
the chicken mole?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.464
Uh, what's wrong
with the shrimp?

02:10.881 --> 02:12.299
We're out. Of all fish.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.426
The order never got placed
with the supplier.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.469
That's crazy.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.095
Hey, Oscar.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.182
What's the deal?
No fish?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.392
A few things have fallen
through the cracks

02:22.392 --> 02:23.560
since your brother's
been out.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.313
I just wanna make sure
Rafa was all right

02:26.313 --> 02:28.523
before I put the pressure
back on him.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.317
Well, Rafa's
fully recovered.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.152
It's Emilio who isn't.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.737
This whole thing
really spooked him.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.406
I don't think he's ready to let
the baby out of his sight.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.616
(cell phone chimes)

02:37.616 --> 02:39.159
Oh, wait, he's texting me
right now.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.079
Says he wants us to bring him
back an order of...

02:44.122 --> 02:45.374
the shrimp diablo.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.002
Let him know there's stuff here
he really needs to take care of.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.130
Oscar:
Including filling
Vanessa's position.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.423
It's a shame she quit.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.466
Do you blame her?

02:54.466 --> 02:56.259
He set up a few
hostess interviews

02:56.259 --> 02:57.678
but never followed up.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.305
As a matter of fact, we got
a young lady here right now.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.766
Hmm, better to send
her home, Oscar.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.267
Emilio will have
to reschedule.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.103
‐This is her?
‐Yeah.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.187
Beto: Natalia?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.232
She doesn't have
any restaurant experience.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.653
Says here she's
an... A‐U pair?

03:14.653 --> 03:16.279
(both chuckle)

03:16.279 --> 03:17.781
What? Is that like
a sous chef?

03:17.781 --> 03:19.116
No. More like a nanny.

03:19.658 --> 03:20.951
What does it say
under special skills?

03:20.951 --> 03:22.994
People write
the craziest stuff
under special skills.

03:23.662 --> 03:24.746
It says she's...

03:24.746 --> 03:26.832
All:
Certified in infant CPR.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.585
‐I'll go see if
I can catch her.
‐Run.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.295
Uh, but don't seem desperate!

03:32.295 --> 03:34.297
♪♪

03:50.147 --> 03:52.149
Emilio: Okay, this is
everything you need to know
about lead poisoning,

03:52.149 --> 03:54.651
uh, the chelation treatment,
and the symptoms
to watch out for.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.195
Headline is looking out
for iron deficiency,

03:57.195 --> 03:58.822
so I've prepped
some sweet potatoes and‐‐

03:58.822 --> 04:00.073
Spinach.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.116
You told me, remember?

04:01.116 --> 04:02.159
In the fridge.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.536
Did he give you
the number for 911?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.038
(chuckling)

04:07.664 --> 04:09.249
Time to go to work
like a big boy.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.126
Ooh, <i>gordito.</i>

04:11.668 --> 04:13.170
I'm just gonna do
a half day today, okay?

04:13.170 --> 04:15.088
Lucia:
Uh‐huh. You'll be back
before you know it.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.132
Emilio: I can be home
anytime if you need me.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.258
Anytime.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.010
I've got it
under control.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.012
Uh...

04:23.054 --> 04:24.139
Bye, Rafita.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.140
Mwah.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.978
Ready to have
some fun?

04:29.978 --> 04:32.022
(party chatter)

04:33.064 --> 04:35.317
(all cheering)

04:41.281 --> 04:42.824
How'd you learn
to do that?

04:43.366 --> 04:44.618
My dad.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.496
Though we don't play
as often as we used to.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.166
Sorry, Matt.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.835
I'm going to miss
at some point. I promise.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.339
Girl: There you go.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.050
So, you're friends
with Matt, huh?

05:00.550 --> 05:01.468
Did you meet at school?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.513
Church. We bonded
over our atheism.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.473
What's he like?

05:06.473 --> 05:07.599
Does he have
a girlfriend?

05:08.391 --> 05:10.101
He's not much
of a talker.

05:10.852 --> 05:11.978
Sasha: Oh yeah,
you're definitely my favorite.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.146
Tess:
Way better than Drew.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.649
Drew! Mr. Over‐Promise
and Under‐Deliver.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.067
Then there was Graham.
She broke up with him

05:17.067 --> 05:18.777
on their one‐month
anniversary.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.028
Uh, no, girl.
She dumped him

05:20.028 --> 05:22.197
because he forgot their
one‐month anniversary.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.075
Right. He was oblivious
and planned nothing.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.159
When's yours?

05:27.160 --> 05:27.994
It's tomorrow.

05:28.745 --> 05:29.788
Should I have
planned something?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.876
Matthew:
Seven, corner pocket.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.631
Cardigan
and Sex Pistols t‐shirt.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.007
Look‐but‐don't‐look.

05:42.551 --> 05:43.552
Hmm?

05:45.136 --> 05:46.012
Do you think
she's cute?

05:47.138 --> 05:48.181
I don't know, Luce.

05:49.432 --> 05:52.060
You'd rather play pool
than talk to a cute girl
who's vibing you?

05:53.436 --> 05:54.646
This, I know
how to do.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.231
But that...

05:56.731 --> 05:57.899
Oh, come on!

05:58.650 --> 05:59.901
At least go say hi.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.361
And then what?

06:01.987 --> 06:04.197
She says, tell me
a little about yourself,

06:04.197 --> 06:05.699
and where do I start?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.033
Undocumented?
Or homeless?

06:07.534 --> 06:09.828
Yes, but putting all that
aside for a second‐‐

06:09.828 --> 06:11.246
I can't put
that aside!

06:12.831 --> 06:14.749
Right,
but putting aside

06:14.749 --> 06:16.126
that you can't
put it aside...

06:17.294 --> 06:18.712
Ella: Come on, Matt!
You're up!

06:25.635 --> 06:27.304
(door opens, closes)

06:31.725 --> 06:33.101
Acostas in the kitchen.

06:33.852 --> 06:34.853
Now.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.241
What the hell is that thing
doing in our home?

06:49.951 --> 06:50.785
Hmm?

06:51.286 --> 06:52.454
Anybody gonna answer me?

06:52.454 --> 06:53.788
It came from Ella.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.124
(sighs)

06:56.583 --> 06:57.959
Where is the
dining room table?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.504
Beto made everyone lug it
down into the basement.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.006
Really, Bey?

07:04.132 --> 07:06.343
That social worker could
literally walk in here
any minute

07:06.343 --> 07:07.761
and deem me
an unfit parent

07:07.761 --> 07:09.721
‐because I'm running
a pool hall!
‐Beto: What's the prob?

07:09.721 --> 07:11.723
The second anyone
rings that doorbell,

07:11.723 --> 07:13.600
I toss a tablecloth
over it and boom:

07:13.600 --> 07:14.559
dining room table.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.312
Emilio: And you?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.482
‐Didn't think to call me?
‐Natalia: I'm sorry.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.692
I thought I was just
supposed to babysit Rafa.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.029
Since when do we need
your permission to have
our friends over?

07:26.404 --> 07:27.864
Since your brother
was in the hospital.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.159
Who knows what kind of germs
those kids are exposing him to,

07:31.159 --> 07:32.786
right here
in his own home?

07:32.786 --> 07:33.662
Beto: Look, man...

07:35.121 --> 07:36.122
I get it.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.832
You're afraid...

07:39.209 --> 07:40.335
that something bad
could happen

07:40.335 --> 07:42.379
because something bad
already has happened.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.464
The way I see it...

07:46.174 --> 07:47.342
we can either
sit in a room

07:47.342 --> 07:49.302
and worry about what
the next bad thing is.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.137
Or...

07:52.389 --> 07:54.557
we can sit in a room,
play pool, and worry.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.061
I vote B.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.190
I mean, haven't we all
earned the right to have
a little fun?

08:04.359 --> 08:06.069
But if Beto gets
to keep the pool table,

08:06.069 --> 08:08.363
it's only fair that I get
to get something I want, too.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.031
What kind of logic
is that?

08:10.782 --> 08:11.825
Huh?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.119
Beto's pool table
isn't costing me a penny.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.080
Those dance classes you want
are super expensive.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.123
And the ones
at the Y are‐‐

08:18.123 --> 08:19.833
I want to krump.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.334
They don't offer classes
in krumping.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.586
(sighs) Well, then learn
a different style.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.463
Tap! Tap sounds fun, right?

08:25.463 --> 08:27.006
It's not tap.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.758
The brochure said
"tap‐ercise."

08:28.758 --> 08:31.052
It's also open
to ages 10 to 100.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.095
I'd rather be dead.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.263
Emilio: Look,

08:33.263 --> 08:34.597
if you're gonna have a tantrum,
just please do it

08:34.597 --> 08:35.682
somewhere Rafa
can't hear you.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.393
(frustrated sigh)

08:39.144 --> 08:40.270
Man.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.229
She's good.

08:41.730 --> 08:45.150
She's got that telenovela
head‐turn and everything.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.653
It's okay.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.530
I'll just let her
stay up late tonight,

08:50.530 --> 08:51.740
and she'll love me again
in the morning.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.744
So I got the whole story
from the kids.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.455
Three days in the hospital
is no walk in the park.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.541
Yeah.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.045
Yeah, but Rafa's okay now,
and that's all that matters.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.213
Your parents must've
really trusted you

09:07.213 --> 09:09.466
to leave you with
so much responsibility.

09:10.759 --> 09:11.760
Yeah.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.220
They sure did.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.682
Lucia: Milo!

09:17.682 --> 09:18.892
Beto: Quick, dude!

09:18.892 --> 09:20.060
What now?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.478
‐Beto: Jesus!
‐Lucia: Ooh!

09:22.812 --> 09:25.148
There was a pop and then
water just started spraying out!

09:25.148 --> 09:26.149
Uh...

09:27.275 --> 09:28.151
I have a cousin
who's a plumber.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.402
‐I could give him a call?
‐It's fine.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.987
‐I can handle it.
‐Natalia: Are you sure?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.113
I said I got it!

09:36.868 --> 09:38.703
I'm just gonna need
a few things from
the hardware store.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.083
It's a good thing
I was here, huh?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.881
Ma'am, getting in my face
isn't helping the situation.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.967
There's an outstanding warrant
for his arrest.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.302
Mr. Ramirez
is coming with us.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.720
So that you
can deport him?

09:56.346 --> 09:58.264
Not happening. May I see
the warrant, please?

09:58.264 --> 09:59.140
Can you identify yourself?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.101
Teresa Sullivan.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.602
I'm with Dream
for Justice.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.896
We're an immigrant
rights organization.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.525
(speaking Spanish)

10:11.694 --> 10:12.987
You got a phone?

10:13.530 --> 10:14.531
Turn it on.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.869
Officer:
Mr. Ramirez failed
to appear in court.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.705
Teresa:
For a speeding ticket that
he got five years ago.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.541
This is an
administrative warrant,

10:24.541 --> 10:26.167
not a judicial warrant.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.460
Hasn't been signed
by a judge.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.504
You're obstructing
a legal proceeding.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.964
Teresa: No way.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.675
Technically, we're standing
on private property.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.135
That means you need
a search warrant

10:35.135 --> 10:38.096
to apprehend him
or a judicial warrant,

10:38.096 --> 10:39.973
and you have neither.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.516
Are you getting this?

10:50.233 --> 10:52.277
Man on screen:
<i>Nudge it this way</i>
<i>and you'll feel it loosen up‐‐</i>

10:52.277 --> 10:54.696
Hey, are plumbers' tape
and Teflon tape the same thing?

10:56.239 --> 10:57.615
I should've asked Lucia
to get both.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.786
Hey, since you're
gonna be staying home
to deal with this,

11:01.786 --> 11:04.205
I should probably
head to the restaurant
to cover for you, huh?

11:04.205 --> 11:05.623
Yeah, would you?
That would be great.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.793
Do you think I could maybe
get paid for the hours?

11:09.252 --> 11:11.921
You want me to pay you
for filling in for me
while I fix our plumbing?

11:12.463 --> 11:13.840
I just need
to make money.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.133
Fast.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.176
Yeah, well,
when you figure out

11:16.176 --> 11:17.635
a way to do so,
let me know.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.556
Man on screen:
<i>Likely the leak is</i>
<i>coming from up above‐‐</i>

11:22.015 --> 11:23.099
Ella's not...

11:25.059 --> 11:26.060
No.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.604
No. God, no.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.065
Swear on Rafa's life.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.775
Really?

11:33.109 --> 11:33.985
Don't you think
that's a little...

11:36.196 --> 11:37.488
I swear on Rafa's life.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.657
I just want to take Ella out
to a nice dinner.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.659
Take her to the restaurant.
Won't cost you a thing.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.453
I want to take her
someplace fancy.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.829
(snickers)

11:44.829 --> 11:46.456
You can't afford
anyplace fancy.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.124
Yeah, but it's
our anniversary.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.628
Our one‐month anniversary,
but still.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.631
I need to show her
how much I care.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.007
(volume increases)

11:56.007 --> 11:57.842
By spending money
that I don't have.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.802
Man on screen:
<i>...slight crack in the PVC,</i>

11:59.802 --> 12:01.638
<i>which will need</i>
<i>to be replaced.</i>

12:01.638 --> 12:04.515
Teresa over phone speakers:
<i>Technically, we're standing</i>
<i>on private property.</i>

12:04.515 --> 12:06.935
<i>That means you need</i>
<i>a search warrant</i>
<i>to apprehend him</i>

12:06.935 --> 12:08.311
<i>or a judicial‐‐</i>

12:08.311 --> 12:09.854
How amazing is she?

12:09.854 --> 12:12.106
Just the fact that people
like her even exist

12:12.106 --> 12:13.066
blows my mind.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.903
You know, she's probably
an expert on DACA renewals.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.279
Not going down
that road, Luce.

12:18.947 --> 12:22.116
You got me a pristine
social security number
off that guy.

12:22.784 --> 12:23.952
I'm all set.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.245
Grateful and set.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.871
I got you a job.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.124
If someone finds out
you have a fake number,

12:30.124 --> 12:31.334
you could still
get deported.

12:31.709 --> 12:32.919
DACA's a sure thing.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.128
I mean, you could get
a driver's license,

12:34.128 --> 12:36.214
open a bank account,
finish school‐‐

12:36.214 --> 12:37.131
Drop it, Lucia.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.883
You could make
new friends,

12:38.883 --> 12:40.510
meet girls, and not feel
like you have to lie

12:40.510 --> 12:41.344
about your status.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.637
So what?

12:42.637 --> 12:44.472
I told you,
I don't care about that.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.183
(water running)

12:48.601 --> 12:50.812
You don't have anything
to be afraid of.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.065
You think I'm afraid?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.150
That's what you think
this is about?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.319
Why else wouldn't
you want to renew?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.865
It would make everything
so much easier.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.035
Well, I like
my life hard, okay.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.454
Makes me feel like
I'm actually living it.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.462
(hip‐hop music playing
over cell phone speakers)

13:16.462 --> 13:17.714
<i>♪ Girl you like me ♪</i>

13:18.464 --> 13:19.549

13:19.549 --> 13:20.842
<i>♪ Girl</i>

13:23.386 --> 13:25.263
Beto and I are
gonna watch some TV.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.139
You wanna join?

13:26.431 --> 13:27.557
Nah.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.641
If it's something
you don't like,

13:28.641 --> 13:30.351
you two'll probably
just end up making out.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.520
You didn't like any
of the stuff I scavenged

13:32.520 --> 13:34.188
from my stepmom's
Goodwill donation?

13:34.689 --> 13:36.024
Everything's too big.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.193
You'll grow into it.
I can tell.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.195
In a couple of months,
you're gonna have
a growth spurt.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.531
In all directions.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.741
(chuckles)

13:45.199 --> 13:47.910
I think this might look
really good on you.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.787
It's cashmere.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.206
Where does all this stuff
come from anyways?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.876
Whenever Wendy
reinvents herself,

13:54.876 --> 13:56.419
she cleans out her closet.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.963
Then I collect the stuff,
and I sell it.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.841
In January, I paid for me
and five friends

14:01.841 --> 14:03.176
to go on a ski trip.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.343
‐Seriously?
‐Hmm.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.596
From a bunch
of old stuff?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.181
You'd be shocked
how much people would pay

14:08.181 --> 14:09.557
for a designer handbag.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.851
It could be
a few thousand dollars.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.146
And... you use the money

14:15.146 --> 14:17.315
to pay for stuff that
your parents won't let you have?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.400
That's the best part.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.028
I never have to ask
my dad for cash anymore.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.698
Why?

14:26.324 --> 14:27.700
What did Emilio
say "no" to?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.040
Natalia:
Your brother's
down for the count.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.044
So I'm just gonna head out,
if you don't mind.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.295
I have a reading, so...

14:39.295 --> 14:40.421
(grunts)

14:41.172 --> 14:41.964
You're into that stuff?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.050
Yeah, pretty deep into it.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.551
You?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.011
Can I be honest?

14:47.678 --> 14:50.139
Nuh‐uh. No, I think it's all
pretty much bullshit.

14:50.765 --> 14:51.766
No offense.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.768
Okay. Well...

14:54.811 --> 14:56.938
It's something that's
really important to me,

14:56.938 --> 14:58.314
but obviously
it's not for everyone.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.024
I had it done once
at a party.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.361
This woman said I had
an especially long life line,
and...

15:04.570 --> 15:05.404
this?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.866
The scar I got opening
a can of baked beans

15:08.866 --> 15:10.493
on a camping trip
in third grade.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.036
(chuckles)

15:12.620 --> 15:14.205
‐Hmm.
‐(laughs)

15:14.205 --> 15:15.206
What?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.959
A poetry reading.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.169
‐I write poetry.
‐Oh, I thought like...

15:20.795 --> 15:22.130
crystal balls‐‐

15:22.130 --> 15:25.049
No. That is
total bullshit.

15:25.049 --> 15:25.967
I agree.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.847
Mmm.
Poems didn't do anything
for me in school.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.100
But, I mean,
I love music.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.269
That's kind of
a poetry, right?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.105
Yeah, it is.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.068
‐Um... mm‐hmm.
‐I'm gonna...

15:44.068 --> 15:45.153
‐Yeah, um...
‐I'm gonna go.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.529
Hey, you mind, uh,
giving me a hand?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.072
Run the sink
when I tell you.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.368
Okay, turn it on.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.121
It works.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.206
‐Ooh!
‐Ah! Damn it!

15:57.206 --> 15:58.499
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.004
I could still call
my cousin, you know.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.047
No, no, no.
Just, uh, grab the wrench.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.091
Are you sure you got it
if I let go?

16:07.091 --> 16:09.218
Um... yeah.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.720
Okay.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.972
(Rafa crying)

16:12.972 --> 16:14.098
(sighs)

16:15.433 --> 16:16.475
Could you go
check on him?

16:16.475 --> 16:18.603
I'm sure he'll go
back to sleep.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.146
Look, for my own peace
of mind, could you please‐‐

16:20.146 --> 16:22.190
He was putting himself back
to sleep before the hospital,

16:22.190 --> 16:23.191
wasn't he?

16:23.191 --> 16:24.817
Don't you want him
to go back to that?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.194
Look, if you won't go
check on him, then I will.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.320
Just come and hold it
and I'll go.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.864
Just wait one minute.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.200
(Rafa fussing)

16:35.578 --> 16:36.913
(Rafa stops fussing)

16:38.748 --> 16:39.999
See you
in the morning.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.382
Oh.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.261
♪♪

17:02.230 --> 17:03.189
Shouldn't you be
at work?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.316
I'm waiting for Natalia
to get here.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.859
I'm gonna have her watch
Rafa at the restaurant.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.527
‐What did you order?
‐Nothing.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.906
Yeah. Well, you
must've wanted nothing
to get here pretty fast, huh?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.700
Overnight!
That costs extra.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.370
If you must know,
it's, um...

17:18.204 --> 17:19.247
lady stuff.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.498
Mm‐hmm.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.791
Okay. Open it.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.752
Personal lady stuff.
For my lady regions.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.004
Mm‐hmm.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.216
Hey, you can't
just do that!

17:33.970 --> 17:35.054
The Glow Ups?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.640
Isn't that the name
of the dance troupe
you're not joining?

17:37.640 --> 17:39.892
I found a way
to pay for it.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.435
Did you take
the credit card?

17:42.311 --> 17:43.479
That is not okay, Val.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.147
Ella paid for it, okay.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.190
For the outfit,
for the lessons.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.817
So, you don't have
to worry about it.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.944
I said no to this.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.195
You can't just go
behind my back

17:51.195 --> 17:52.530
and beg other people
to buy you stuff.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.198
I didn't beg.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.992
It was a present.
What's the big deal?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.910
I found something
I'm excited about,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.453
it's not costing you
a penny,

17:59.453 --> 18:01.080
and there's absolutely
no reason

18:01.080 --> 18:02.498
I shouldn't be allowed
to have it!

18:06.127 --> 18:08.045
We're not done
talking about this!

18:08.045 --> 18:09.338
Valentina: Yes, we are!

18:12.592 --> 18:14.010
I know you probably
have an opinion.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.012
It would be great
if you kept it to yourself.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.600
So your friend just refuses
to look into renewal?

18:21.392 --> 18:22.768
His plan is
to keep working off

18:22.768 --> 18:24.729
a fake social security number
I got him.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.939
I don't really
want to say how.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.192
Well, however you got it,
you can both be charged

18:30.192 --> 18:31.277
with identity theft.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.154
That's a felony for you

18:33.154 --> 18:35.239
and a removable offense
for your friend.

18:36.324 --> 18:39.201
Uh, it was just supposed
to be a temporary fix.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.287
But if he renewed
his DACA status‐‐

18:41.287 --> 18:43.581
Yeah, but it seems like
he's been pretty clear that
he doesn't wanna do that.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.000
But if he heard
from you what's involved,

18:46.000 --> 18:46.959
maybe he's more likely to‐‐

18:46.959 --> 18:47.918
You think
a total stranger

18:47.918 --> 18:49.086
can make a more
compelling case

18:49.086 --> 18:50.296
than someone
who really knows him?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.049
Matthew and I met
pretty recently.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.134
I don't know much
about him.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.261
You seem pretty invested
in what happens to him.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.307
I saw you in the parking lot
with that man.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.019
Aren't you invested
in what happens to people
you don't even know?

19:05.519 --> 19:07.647
Yes, but that's
the work that I do.

19:08.189 --> 19:11.150
Look, maybe you're
the world's greatest
good Samaritan,

19:11.692 --> 19:14.111
who's happy to jack
a social security number

19:14.111 --> 19:16.197
for some kid
she's just met.

19:17.365 --> 19:21.077
I'm just wondering if maybe
there's something in it
for you, too.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.291
Seriously, how'd you even know
about this place?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.793
You kidding me?
I love fondue.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.961
I actually even made it
a couple times.

19:31.837 --> 19:35.174
By accidentally leaving
a bag of grated cheddar
in a very, very hot car.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.594
I actually never heard
of the stuff.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.013
But Avery says
it's your favorite.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.807
Waiter:
Have you two decided?

19:42.807 --> 19:43.849
Beto: Uh, yes.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.059
I think we're going to do

19:45.059 --> 19:47.061
the "pricks" fix menu.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.232
Ella: Oh, wait...

19:52.149 --> 19:54.485
I kinda hate
Caesar salad, anchovies.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.113
Uh, can she
swap salads?

19:57.113 --> 19:59.949
The <i>prix</i> fix menu
can be limiting.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.492
Perhaps you'd prefer
to order a la carte?

20:01.492 --> 20:03.619
Ooh... then I can get
the lobster.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.080
Hmm. People do love
the lobster.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.041
People are also
very allergic to lobster.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.292
Deathly allergic.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.087
Ooh, that does open us up
for the soufflé for dessert.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.005
If you'd like
the soufflé trio,

20:15.715 --> 20:17.591
well, I'd need to put
the order in right now.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.427
Soufflé‐‐

20:19.427 --> 20:22.096
I say we go for it.
What do you say, Beto?

20:23.848 --> 20:24.890
Yay.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.729

He's fine.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.169
Well, I'm taking care
of him.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.923
I am... taking care
of everyone.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.092
Everything.

22:23.092 --> 22:26.178
(in Spanish)

22:43.445 --> 22:46.615
God, I should not have
eaten all that bread.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.950
I'm already full.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.410
Well, we can
cancel dessert?

22:49.410 --> 22:50.619
I'm sure
they'd let us‐‐

22:50.619 --> 22:51.996
Another bottle
of sparkling?

22:52.997 --> 22:54.373
‐Uh, I think we're good‐‐
‐Thanks a lot, Greg.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.168
Do you think
he's an actor?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.587
Most waiters
in LA are actors.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.380
Not the ones
at our restaurant.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.757
For a while there,
I thought

23:03.757 --> 23:05.509
maybe I wanted to act.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.094
You're definitely
pretty enough.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.140
But it passed.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.142
Like every idea I have.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.270
Nothing... sticks,
you know?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.023
Shouldn't I have some clue
of what I want?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.110
All I know is, "A,"

23:24.278 --> 23:25.362
I want to be with you.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.490
And, "B,"
I want to travel.

23:29.033 --> 23:29.950
Don't you?

23:30.576 --> 23:32.286
Maybe this summer
we can go someplace?

23:32.286 --> 23:34.455
Oh, maybe we can
drive across country?

23:34.455 --> 23:36.373
I have summer school,
remember? I can't.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.168
But even if I didn't,

23:40.044 --> 23:41.712
I can't really
afford that, Ella.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.297
No, I know. Of course not.
It'd be my treat.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.550
I don't want you to pay
for stuff for me.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.218
Why?

23:48.218 --> 23:50.262
If it's something
we both want to do,

23:50.262 --> 23:52.765
only you can't afford it,
what's the big deal if I pay?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.099
Because I can't
reciprocate it.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.102
There's nothing that
I'll be able to do for you.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.271
Yeah, but there is.
Look at this.

23:59.772 --> 24:03.025
That lobster
you ordered was $38.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.069
I didn't expect you
to pay for that.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.236
I figured I'd
at least pay half.

24:06.862 --> 24:07.863
Why? Because I'm broke?

24:07.863 --> 24:08.989
No!

24:08.989 --> 24:10.199
Because it's 2020,

24:10.199 --> 24:11.784
and women don't need men
to pay for them!

24:11.784 --> 24:13.410
But I wanted to.
And I could've.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.995
If we'd stuck to the set menu,
I could've done it.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.665
You didn't tell me that!
How was I supposed to know that?

24:17.665 --> 24:19.458
Ella, you know
our situation.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.377
You see how we live.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.420
I didn't ask you to take me
to a fancy restaurant.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.588
That was your idea!

24:25.381 --> 24:26.382
I...

24:27.341 --> 24:28.968
What are you mad
at me for, Beto?

24:30.260 --> 24:32.596
Being a girl who likes things
that you can't afford
to give me?

24:33.847 --> 24:36.141
Or being a girl who likes
to give you things
you can't afford?

24:37.393 --> 24:38.394
I don't know.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.145
Well, figure it out.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.151
Waiter: Your entree, sir.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.158
Emilio: I wish
you hadn't done that.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.536
You mean the call just now?
With your dad?

24:56.036 --> 24:58.247
You didn't want Rafa
talking to his father?

24:58.247 --> 24:59.999
Excuse me,
you're Emilio?

25:00.582 --> 25:02.042
‐The manager said I should‐‐
‐One second.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.461
Rafa shouldn't be looking
at a screen all day.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.506
He wasn't.
We've been here
eight hours.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.050
There's only so long
he was happy banging a pot.

25:10.050 --> 25:13.012
I'm here to interview
for the position?

25:13.971 --> 25:14.972
By any chance,

25:15.556 --> 25:17.391
do you have any experience
taking care of children?

25:17.933 --> 25:19.810
Do you have
a flawless driving record?

25:19.810 --> 25:21.311
Do you know
infant CPR?

25:21.311 --> 25:23.647
I thought this was
a hostess job.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.648
Yeah.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.025
So did I.

25:27.401 --> 25:28.736
The real question is:

25:28.736 --> 25:30.404
are you okay
having a boss

25:30.404 --> 25:32.031
who thinks he wants you
to watch the baby,

25:32.031 --> 25:34.033
but really, he wants you
to watch the baby

25:34.033 --> 25:35.492
‐while he watches you?
‐Emilio: No, no, no.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.244
You see, the real question is:
can you follow instructions?

25:37.244 --> 25:38.871
Like when I ask you
to watch the baby,

25:38.871 --> 25:40.247
will you, in fact,
check on the baby?

25:41.331 --> 25:43.625
Now seems like a bad time.
I can come back la‐‐

25:43.625 --> 25:45.669
Rafa put himself
back to sleep.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.587
That's irrelevant.

25:46.587 --> 25:47.921
I'm your employer.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.049
I asked you to perform
a simple task that‐‐

25:50.049 --> 25:51.175
(cell phone ringing)

25:52.259 --> 25:53.177
What is it, Bey?

25:53.177 --> 25:54.678
You're just looking
to find fault, Emilio.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.180
Look, I'm in the middle
of something, okay.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.973
There is no one
who can do the job the way
you want them to do it...

25:57.973 --> 25:58.932
Yes, just get
to the point.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.100
...because you want
to do it yourself.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.019
So why don't you?

26:02.770 --> 26:03.729
I quit.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.231
‐You wha‐‐ You what?
‐You are an angel.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.817
Your brother?
Not so much.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.235
(chuckles) No.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.237
Just, just...
Look, wait.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.199
Just stay put.
I'll be right there.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.040
Is there any chance
you can quit tomorrow?

26:26.919 --> 26:27.961
Greg:
Still working, are we?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.673
Yes, Greg, we are.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.509
And will your companion be...

26:33.509 --> 26:35.260
No, she won't.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.012
And may I...

26:37.721 --> 26:38.972
Just one more minute.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.142
Can I, uh, get
some more coffee, please?

26:43.060 --> 26:44.061
Sure thing.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.938
Thank you. Really.

26:45.938 --> 26:46.980
Thank you.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.493
Are you out
of your mind?

27:00.119 --> 27:01.286
Taking her to
a place like this?

27:01.286 --> 27:03.163
I didn't expect her
to order the lobster.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.457
And where'd you get
the money to pay for any of it?

27:11.213 --> 27:14.007
‐Please don't tell me
you sold your blood.
‐I didn't.

27:14.967 --> 27:15.968
I sold my plasma.

27:21.807 --> 27:22.933
What is wrong
with you, Beto?

27:23.684 --> 27:25.727
Hmm? Why do you have
to impress this girl?

27:26.520 --> 27:28.230
Either she's into you
or she's not.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.316
But why do you have
to spend money that
you don't have on her?

27:31.900 --> 27:32.943
Money I don't have.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.995
Holy shit.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.999
Well, I guess
now we're even.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.376
‐You and me?
‐No. Me and Ella.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.461
Oh, you don't know?

27:52.462 --> 27:54.798
Ella paid
for Val's dance classes.

27:55.716 --> 27:56.717
Yeah.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.137
Six months of lessons cost
exactly the same as this meal.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.474
You let her pay
for Val's classes?

28:04.474 --> 28:06.727
She didn't ask?
She just did it.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.188
I've gotta, uh...

28:12.107 --> 28:13.108
I'll see you at home.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.157
(sighs)

28:26.747 --> 28:27.831
Natalia!

28:32.878 --> 28:34.963
(footsteps thumping)

28:36.089 --> 28:37.424
‐I've been calling you!
‐Where's Rafa?

28:37.424 --> 28:39.676
He's been down for an hour.
I triple checked.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.596
We came home,
and there was water everywhere.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.222
And I called my cousin
to turn off the main valve‐‐

28:44.222 --> 28:45.933
I told you not to.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.226
It was an emergency,
and I'm helping you out.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.227
You should be
thanking me.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.022
Anyway, he says that
all the plumbing's
in terrible shape,

28:52.022 --> 28:53.273
not just the pipe
that burst.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.233
And also if you
open up the walls,

28:55.233 --> 28:57.069
you're gonna find
a lot of corrosion.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.822
Also, who patched
everywhere with duct tape?
Was that your dad?

29:00.822 --> 29:03.241
Because Cesar said that
this is gonna keep happening

29:03.241 --> 29:04.701
over and over again

29:04.701 --> 29:07.621
unless you address
the larger problem.

29:07.621 --> 29:08.872
You think
I don't know that?

29:09.873 --> 29:12.125
You think I think I have
any idea what I'm doing?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.211
Well, you seem to want
to do everything yourself.

29:14.211 --> 29:16.380
Because the second
anyone takes a closer look,

29:16.380 --> 29:18.215
a babysitter,
a social worker,

29:19.257 --> 29:20.008
a plumber...

29:22.678 --> 29:24.638
they'll see that I'm just
a shitty patch job, too.

29:29.142 --> 29:32.688
It's not that my parents
trusted me to take care
of this family.

29:35.565 --> 29:37.442
It's that there was
no one else to do the job.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.950
And there are leaks
everywhere I turn‐‐

29:45.659 --> 29:46.994
in the restaurant,
the house...

29:48.745 --> 29:50.789
Val this morning,
Beto this evening, the baby...

29:52.374 --> 29:53.542
always.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.255
Whichever one is worse
at the moment,

29:58.255 --> 29:59.756
that's the one
I grab onto...

30:01.758 --> 30:03.260
until something else leaks.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.012
(Rafa crying)

30:07.848 --> 30:09.099
I‐I should go
check on him?

30:10.517 --> 30:11.560
I'll go.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.103
(Rafa continues crying)

30:23.280 --> 30:25.657
I was hoping
you'd bring me my lobster,

30:25.657 --> 30:28.201
you know,
like Prince Charming
returning my slipper.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.621
I mean,
I have an evil stepmom
and everything.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.622
And I am Ella.

30:33.331 --> 30:35.959
You know, like,
Cinder... ella.

30:37.127 --> 30:38.253
Not even a smile?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.338
I'm confused.

30:40.839 --> 30:41.965
Aren't you mad at me?

30:43.258 --> 30:45.177
I made a good
dramatic exit,

30:45.177 --> 30:47.095
and now I'm over it.

30:48.472 --> 30:49.514
Well, I'm not.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.267
When Emilio came
to bail me out,

30:52.267 --> 30:54.394
he told me that you're paying
for Val's classes?

30:57.189 --> 30:58.273
Why would you do that?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.944
Be‐‐ Because I‐‐

31:04.279 --> 31:05.822
I don't‐‐
Because she wanted them.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.033
And after everything
she'd been through,

31:08.033 --> 31:10.202
I thought she deserved
to get something she wanted.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.746
And maybe she'd like you
a little more?

31:14.289 --> 31:15.665
You thought
I'd like you more

31:15.665 --> 31:16.958
if you bought me
a fancy dinner.

31:16.958 --> 31:17.959
‐What's the difference?
‐No.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.128
Mine wasn't a bribe.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.215
It was a mistake...

31:25.050 --> 31:25.967
but it wasn't a bribe.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.013
Are you breaking up
with me?

31:31.056 --> 31:32.432
I don't...
I don't know.

31:32.432 --> 31:35.018
I've had, like, seven cups
of coffee in the last hour,

31:35.018 --> 31:36.311
and my mind's racing, and...

31:37.187 --> 31:38.605
I keep thinking
how you said that

31:38.605 --> 31:40.607
in your family
money equals love and...

31:42.692 --> 31:44.361
I think on some level
you believe it.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.613
(chuckles)

31:47.405 --> 31:50.283
Yeah, well, my dad
offered me diamond studs

31:50.283 --> 31:52.035
and a trip to Fiji
to break up with you.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.622
And for the record,
I told him
he could go to hell.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.875
Maybe that's why
you like me.

32:00.752 --> 32:01.920
Because your dad doesn't.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.381
Wow!

32:05.799 --> 32:07.551
You really think
I'm that shallow?

32:07.551 --> 32:08.593
Or, no, wait,

32:09.010 --> 32:12.055
maybe you think
I couldn't possibly
like you just for you?

32:12.055 --> 32:13.890
Are you really
that insecure?

32:14.516 --> 32:16.184
You know, maybe that's,
that's one way

32:16.184 --> 32:18.103
losing your parents
really screwed you up.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.313
It made you think that
being a good person

32:20.981 --> 32:22.107
just isn't enough.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.028
But you are, Beto.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.698
And that's enough for me.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.497
Uh, let's just not
break up, okay?

32:37.497 --> 32:39.166
Okay? I just, I...

32:40.417 --> 32:41.918
I really don't want
to break up.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.925
I can't tell
what you're thinking.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.138
I, I just...
I really need to pee.

32:55.265 --> 32:56.057
(chuckles)

32:59.311 --> 33:00.520
Emilio: He's asleep.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.027
Look, I'm sorry about
unloading all that on you.

33:09.279 --> 33:12.115
If you want, I can add up
your hours and, uh,
write you a check.

33:15.368 --> 33:16.995
He's going to fall down,
you know.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.289
Hit his head.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.209
He's gonna have colds

33:22.709 --> 33:23.710
and fevers

33:24.085 --> 33:25.045
and throw up...

33:26.463 --> 33:27.505
and it's normal.

33:28.590 --> 33:29.591
I know.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.054
I just...
(clears throat)

33:36.139 --> 33:38.183
I can't let anything bad
happen to him.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.018
Ever.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.145
To any of them.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.397
You know?

33:44.397 --> 33:45.607
I've got this
social worker

33:45.607 --> 33:47.025
breathing down
my neck.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.069
We have no running water
in the house.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.738
I'm telling you.
My cousin...

33:51.738 --> 33:52.948
But I get it.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.408
You want to do it
all yourself.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.578
My dad did.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.539
You know, he came
to this country

34:01.539 --> 34:03.291
with fifty dollars
in his pocket.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.919
He had himself
to rely on.

34:06.670 --> 34:07.963
Solved his own problems.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.342
Is that what
he told you?

34:14.511 --> 34:16.179
He was a self‐made man?

34:18.932 --> 34:19.975
Emilio...

34:21.017 --> 34:23.061
no one comes
to this country with nothing

34:23.561 --> 34:27.440
and single‐handedly builds
the life he made here.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.653
It just doesn't happen.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.781
I mean, fifty dollars?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.534
How long
did that last him?

34:38.034 --> 34:39.202
A few days maybe?

34:41.246 --> 34:41.997
No.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.249
What happened is...

34:45.458 --> 34:46.960
they met a man

34:46.960 --> 34:48.253
who knew a man

34:49.004 --> 34:50.880
who loaned them
some cash...

34:52.465 --> 34:54.259
and his cousin

34:54.259 --> 34:56.678
let them sleep
on her pullout sofa

34:58.013 --> 35:01.433
and her husband
was a house painter

35:02.142 --> 35:04.811
who needed an extra guy
on his crew

35:05.562 --> 35:07.188
and gave your father
the job.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.109
That's what
immigrants do.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.486
That's what
my parents did.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.824
They take the hand
that's offered to them

35:18.491 --> 35:20.869
and then they reach back
and extend their own.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.873
And they know
there's no shame in it.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.137
I took off 25 percent.

35:39.721 --> 35:40.597
Friends and family discount.

35:41.973 --> 35:42.974
But I'm neither.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.267
Not yet.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.936
♪♪

35:49.189 --> 35:50.148
Whoa.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.691
Cesar and I worked out
an installment plan.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.777
But still,
the first payment's rough.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.279
Natalia:
It's gonna get loud,

35:56.279 --> 35:57.656
so I'm gonna take him
down to the park.

35:58.031 --> 35:58.865
Have fun.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.621
What?

36:05.246 --> 36:05.997
(chuckles)

36:08.667 --> 36:10.794
Hey. You packed his hat
and sunscreen, right?

36:12.337 --> 36:14.172
Sunscreen. Hat.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.636
(chuckles)

36:20.428 --> 36:22.138
Uh, I could sell
some more of my plasma

36:22.138 --> 36:23.098
in the next few days.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.267
Wha‐‐ What do you mean more?

36:26.267 --> 36:27.560
Maybe we
should ask Ella.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.728
Oh.
(thumps table)

36:28.728 --> 36:30.522
Both:
We're not asking Ella.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.917
I would've done anything
to keep my parents here.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.294
Anything.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.133
I don't want any more people
disappearing on me.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.804
Your DACA renewal?

37:04.180 --> 37:04.973
That's for me.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.144
It's what
I need you to do

37:09.144 --> 37:10.562
to make me feel secure.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.231
And that's not fair.

37:15.984 --> 37:16.985
So...

37:17.819 --> 37:19.070
whatever you want
to do.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.114
Even if it's nothing.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.950
Whatever your reasons are...

37:25.243 --> 37:26.327
even if I don't
understand them.

37:31.458 --> 37:32.792
When I was little,

37:32.792 --> 37:34.169
my mom used
to get mad at me

37:34.169 --> 37:35.295
because of
the clothes I wore.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.965
They were too baggy,
she said.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.968
My nails were too dirty.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.179
I wanted my hair cut
too short.

37:47.557 --> 37:48.933
No matter what I did...

37:51.895 --> 37:53.062
I could never be

37:53.062 --> 37:54.564
the little girl
she wanted.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.075
And I wanted to make
my mother happy.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.412
I tried.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.418
But I couldn't
pretend because...

38:17.170 --> 38:18.129
the thing is...

38:21.674 --> 38:23.259
she didn't give birth
to a daughter.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.189
Lucia, for me
to renew DACA,

38:36.189 --> 38:38.149
I would have to present
my birth certificate.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.944
That's the only way.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.031
But that name...

38:46.825 --> 38:48.076
that's someone
I never was.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.122
And I won't go back
and say that's me...

38:54.249 --> 38:55.083
not for any reason.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.630
Do you see now?

39:01.464 --> 39:02.549
I do.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.844
I see you.

39:07.804 --> 39:08.763
I see you.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.234
Man:
Okay, okay, girls,
let's go around

39:21.234 --> 39:23.027
and everyone
introduce yourselves.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.779
Jocelyn:
Hi, I'm Jocelyn,

39:24.779 --> 39:26.239
this is my second year
with the troupe,

39:26.239 --> 39:28.700
and I love dancing
more than anything.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.451
Kelly‐Anne:
Hi, I'm Kelly‐Anne Penner.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.036
I've been dancing
since I was five,

39:32.036 --> 39:33.955
and I'm really excited
to be here.

39:34.998 --> 39:37.083
Um... hi.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.836
I'm Amanda Davis.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.171
My mom used
to be a ballerina,

39:42.171 --> 39:44.257
and there's nothing
that makes her happier

39:44.257 --> 39:45.425
than watching me dance.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.053
I'm really excited
to be here too.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.223
Emilio: I could see
getting used to this though.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.683
(billiards balls clack)

39:53.683 --> 39:55.852
Enjoying a nice,
relaxing game of billiards

39:55.852 --> 39:57.687
after a long day
of oppressing the masses.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.022
(chuckles)

39:59.022 --> 40:01.107
We'd have to start
smoking cigars

40:01.107 --> 40:02.191
and drinking brandy.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.361
Hey, how much you think
a butler costs?

40:05.695 --> 40:07.155
‐Like, a good one?
‐Hmm.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.239
Probably a lot.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.826
(doorbell rings)

40:11.826 --> 40:12.911
Last shot's yours.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.165
This way, guys,
come on in.

40:17.165 --> 40:20.418
(indistinct chatter)

40:22.545 --> 40:24.505
This is perfect
for the house,

40:24.505 --> 40:25.548
am I right, guys?

40:26.132 --> 40:26.966
Is that new felt?

40:26.966 --> 40:28.718
‐Just had her redone.
‐Man: Yo!

40:29.135 --> 40:30.637
Look, we've had a lot
of calls off the listing,

40:30.637 --> 40:31.763
so the price
is the price.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.264
Hey. Not looking
to haggle.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.185
All right.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.522
‐Take care of her.
‐Man: Ready?

40:41.522 --> 40:42.899
She's been good to us.

40:45.318 --> 40:46.778
Man:
Yup. Yup, yup.
I got it.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.196
Hey, you boys
need help?

40:48.196 --> 40:49.238
‐Man 1: No, we got it.
‐Man 2: We got it.

40:49.906 --> 40:50.782
‐We got it.
‐Keep going.

40:50.782 --> 40:51.991
‐Turn it, turn it.
‐Keep going.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.117
Careful, careful.

40:55.745 --> 40:56.913
Man: Watch the corners.
