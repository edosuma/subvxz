00:01.208 --> 00:06.208
(soft music)
(drink gurgling)

00:09.125 --> 00:11.875
(glass clanking)

00:14.792 --> 00:17.958
(soft dramatic music)

01:14.000 --> 01:17.583
(dramatic music continues)

02:14.417 --> 02:17.000
(bell ringing)

02:22.208 --> 02:23.292
- Miss Aster.

02:25.625 --> 02:26.667
Miss Aster.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.375
- Oh, sorry.

02:40.250 --> 02:43.333
The organism I chose to
do my presentation on

02:43.333 --> 02:45.458
is Apis mellifera, the honeybee.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.083
- Here we go.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.083
- The honeybee is part

02:51.083 --> 02:53.750
of the family Apidae, order
Hymenoptera.

02:54.792 --> 02:58.125
Honey bees are born into
a social caste system,

02:58.125 --> 03:01.250
which determines one of
three roles in the hive.

03:01.250 --> 03:04.125
Drones, workers, and queens.

03:04.125 --> 03:07.083
Drones are male honeybees.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.833
They never leave the hive.

03:08.833 --> 03:10.417
Their only purpose in the hive

03:10.417 --> 03:12.708
is to mate with the virgin
queen.

03:12.708 --> 03:13.667
- You would know.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.375
- After the mating process,

03:19.375 --> 03:24.375
the drone's genitals are
ripped out and he dies.

03:25.958 --> 03:28.625
Worker bees, as their name
implies,

03:28.625 --> 03:31.875
are responsible for the
labor tasks in the hive.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.417
This includes feeding,
nursing and defense.

03:35.292 --> 03:40.292
Queen bees produce the
offspring of the hive.

03:40.292 --> 03:44.000
When a new queen hatches,
she kills the other queens.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Over the years, a queen may
run out of genetic material

03:47.000 --> 03:48.667
and need to be replaced.

03:49.667 --> 03:53.375
Worker bees and queen bees
start off as the same larvae.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.292
The only difference is that the
queen bee

03:57.292 --> 04:00.125
is fed a special food called
royal jelly,

04:00.125 --> 04:03.292
which triggers a different
set of genes to act.

04:03.292 --> 04:05.792
So the next time you see a queen
bee,

04:05.792 --> 04:08.500
you may just be looking at
the Cinderella of her hive.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.583
(students laughing)

04:22.457 --> 04:24.292
- Class, close your eyes, class.

04:24.292 --> 04:27.417
Class, okay, all right enough.

04:30.082 --> 04:31.417
Avert your eyes.

05:51.542 --> 05:56.542
- So, are we just gonna ignore
the elephant in the room?

05:58.707 --> 06:00.542
- Not at dinner, Drew.

06:00.542 --> 06:03.208
- Dad, a dick pic in front

06:03.208 --> 06:05.625
of the entire classroom for
Christ's sake.

06:06.917 --> 06:08.500
- I didn't put it there.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.958
- Oh yeah?

06:09.958 --> 06:11.458
Then who did?

06:11.458 --> 06:14.000
Your fairy godmother?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
- You did.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.207
- You lying little cunt.

06:19.207 --> 06:21.832
- I heard you in the school
bathroom.

06:24.167 --> 06:26.582
- Lurking in the school
bathrooms now.

06:26.582 --> 06:28.125
This is ridiculous.

06:29.582 --> 06:32.042
- I just hope this doesn't
reflect badly on Drew.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.582
- I'm sure Drew's stellar
reputation is still intact.

06:36.582 --> 06:39.207
- Don't be sarcastic, Jody.

06:39.207 --> 06:40.042
It's rude.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.082
- I mean, have you even
considered

06:45.082 --> 06:46.750
getting her professional help?

06:46.750 --> 06:50.375
I mean, all she does is play
with her stupid little bees.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
- You know, actually a
psychiatrist
might not be a bad idea.

06:57.332 --> 06:58.250
- If anyone needs therapy it's
me

06:58.250 --> 07:00.542
with all this estrogen in this
house.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.958
- One night at home for what she
did.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.917
That is so unfair.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.500
- It won't be a vacation.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.667
I'll make sure of that.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.167
She can do an extra share of the
chores.

07:18.625 --> 07:21.292
(ominous music)

07:35.707 --> 07:36.542
- Hey, princess.

07:36.542 --> 07:38.207
Can I come in?

07:38.207 --> 07:39.375
- It's your house.

07:50.457 --> 07:52.417
- You remind me so much of your
mother.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.542
Both of you and those damn bees.

08:00.583 --> 08:01.833
Miss the hell out of her.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.208
- Tell me about it.

08:08.125 --> 08:09.208
- Sorry about dinner.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.833
- I just wish you'd take my side
for once.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.542
- Second marriages are
complicated.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.457
Doesn't mean I'm not a fan of
yours.

08:29.082 --> 08:29.917
- Be careful.

08:29.917 --> 08:31.707
Don't let Drew hear you say
that.

08:35.332 --> 08:36.832
- You wanna know what I think?

08:36.832 --> 08:39.292
I think Drew is a little jealous
of you.

08:39.292 --> 08:40.332
- Jealous?

08:42.292 --> 08:43.125
Right.

08:43.125 --> 08:44.125
- I'm serious.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.292
You're smart, well read.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.458
You got a heart of gold.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.625
- Just what every boy wants.

08:59.458 --> 09:00.875
- Learn to take a compliment.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.917
Try to enjoy your day off at
least.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.667
I'll handle Tremaine.

09:19.708 --> 09:21.750
- I was not eavesdropping.

09:23.917 --> 09:26.208
- I have to be at work early
tomorrow.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.958
Don't leave a mess for your
sister.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.000
- Of course not.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.792
(ominous music)

09:57.083 --> 09:58.333
I'm off to school.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.000
Oh, would you look at that?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.292
I guess I must have
started early this month.

10:04.292 --> 10:05.417
You have a good day.

10:06.292 --> 10:08.958
(ominous music)

10:13.875 --> 10:16.542
(pensive music)

10:43.625 --> 10:46.875
(soft classical music)

11:17.167 --> 11:20.333
(soft dramatic music)

11:30.500 --> 11:31.333
- Richard.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.542
Think it's a game?
- Richard.

11:33.542 --> 11:34.708
What's his last name?

11:34.708 --> 11:36.000
- I don't know.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.667
- Hey, man, what's your mama
name?

11:40.083 --> 11:41.833
- Just lackadaisical walking
through.

11:41.833 --> 11:42.667
- Phone.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.208
Oh, so you wanna keep walking?

11:45.208 --> 11:46.042
- Just keep right on.

11:46.042 --> 11:47.042
He didn't hear you.

11:47.042 --> 11:48.042
- Okay.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.542
- Yup.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.250
- Take that book bag off.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.292
- Hey, if that was my kid,

11:53.292 --> 11:55.458
I'd wake him up at two o'clock
in the morning every morning

11:55.458 --> 11:58.125
to tell him that no one's
ever gonna love him.

11:58.125 --> 12:01.292
(students chattering)

12:07.458 --> 12:09.875
(soft music)

12:49.458 --> 12:51.708
- Good morning, class.

12:51.708 --> 12:54.042
Your regular teacher couldn't be
here.

12:54.042 --> 12:55.542
I'll be your substitute today.

12:56.917 --> 12:59.333
(soft music)

13:11.000 --> 13:11.833
- Hey.

13:17.000 --> 13:17.833
Heads up.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.000
- Is there a problem?

13:38.333 --> 13:42.125
- I just, I don't think it's
fair that she gets to draw

13:42.125 --> 13:43.667
while we're all doing our work.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.208
- [Tresa] Well, why don't you
mind your own damn business?

13:57.208 --> 13:58.375
- Excuse me.

14:01.792 --> 14:02.667
- You heard me.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.917
(ominous music)

14:22.875 --> 14:27.875
(soft music)
(students chattering)

15:14.375 --> 15:17.667
It is gonna be a two Quaalude
kind of day.

15:19.208 --> 15:22.375
(students chattering)

15:27.208 --> 15:29.375
Hey, what you got there?

15:37.875 --> 15:39.458
Too forward?

15:39.458 --> 15:40.500
Sorry.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.667
(students chattering)

16:14.625 --> 16:15.458
Hey.

16:17.000 --> 16:17.917
Where you heading?

16:22.292 --> 16:23.917
Where you heading?

16:23.917 --> 16:24.792
You want a lift?

16:26.792 --> 16:27.625
Hey, watch this.

16:31.167 --> 16:34.250
(horn beeping)

16:34.250 --> 16:35.792
- [Drew] What the hell?

16:38.667 --> 16:39.500
- Boo.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.583
- Crazy bitch.

16:42.583 --> 16:45.167
- What is wrong with that lady?

16:47.958 --> 16:48.792
- Hop in.

16:48.792 --> 16:49.750
I'll give you a lift home.

17:03.125 --> 17:03.958
- Thanks.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.791
- Hey.

17:07.708 --> 17:09.791
You got plans for dinner?

17:29.375 --> 17:32.125
(women laughing)

17:38.625 --> 17:40.083
- The teacher was like,

17:41.792 --> 17:44.417
well try using the word
in a sentence (laughs).

17:50.792 --> 17:53.333
He goes, okay.

17:56.333 --> 18:00.875
When the light turns
green, you must forgo.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.625
(women laughing)

18:06.292 --> 18:11.125
- [Tresa] Oh shit, that's funny
(laughs).

18:12.250 --> 18:15.000
Oh god (laughs).

18:25.375 --> 18:26.583
Oh goodness.

18:29.667 --> 18:32.167
God, we are such kindred
spirits.

18:33.042 --> 18:35.375
- Oh, that's the diet Coke
talking.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.333
- No, I'm serious.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.125
You're the coolest person I
know.

18:41.625 --> 18:44.125
- Try telling the kids at my
school that.

18:44.125 --> 18:44.958
- Oh.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.750
Some people just don't have any
vision.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.792
- Yeah, that's them all right.

18:52.792 --> 18:53.625
Blind AF.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.542
- Hey.

19:04.167 --> 19:07.000
(keys clanking)

19:07.000 --> 19:08.375
- What?

19:08.375 --> 19:10.250
(keys clanking)

19:10.250 --> 19:11.333
Me drive?

19:13.292 --> 19:14.417
- What are you scared?

19:19.667 --> 19:20.583
- Anxiety.

19:22.125 --> 19:22.958
- Sorry.

19:32.417 --> 19:35.250
Hey, I just got an idea.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.083
- [Aster] Yeah?

19:39.000 --> 19:39.833
- Nevermind.

19:40.958 --> 19:42.083
It wouldn't be nice.

19:44.000 --> 19:44.833
- What?

19:48.125 --> 19:49.458
- [Tresa] Come on.

19:49.458 --> 19:52.625
(soft dramatic music)

20:02.667 --> 20:06.000
(engine whirring)

20:06.000 --> 20:09.167
(soft dramatic music)

20:30.750 --> 20:33.167
- Are you sure about this?

20:33.167 --> 20:36.333
(soft dramatic music)

21:13.667 --> 21:14.958
- Your turn.

21:14.958 --> 21:18.125
(soft dramatic music)

21:36.833 --> 21:39.750
(glass shattering)

21:41.917 --> 21:45.083
(soft dramatic music)

22:32.583 --> 22:37.208
God, I can't remember when
I've had this much fun in ages.

22:38.333 --> 22:39.542
- You're telling me.

22:40.833 --> 22:41.667
Oh my gosh.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.458
I wish it didn't have to end.

22:48.042 --> 22:49.333
- You mean that?

22:49.333 --> 22:50.917
- Mean what?

22:50.917 --> 22:52.667
- What you just said.

22:53.833 --> 22:58.833
- I wish, but I'm sure my
stepmom

22:58.833 --> 23:01.583
and half sister are just waiting
inside

23:01.583 --> 23:03.125
to crucify me for something.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.500
- Maybe another night then?

23:09.625 --> 23:10.458
- Maybe.

23:19.042 --> 23:19.875
See you tomorrow.

23:20.958 --> 23:21.792
- You never know.

23:33.375 --> 23:34.833
- [Drew] Where have you been?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.750
- [Aster] Nowhere.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.375
- Yeah, we'll see what
dad has to say about that.

23:42.542 --> 23:43.375
Bitch.

23:47.458 --> 23:51.250
- I cannot believe the
guts on that little bitch.

23:52.542 --> 23:53.833
- Guts.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.667
Right.

23:55.625 --> 23:59.000
- Even you have to admit
that she got you pretty good.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.417
- Whose friend are you again?

24:02.792 --> 24:03.625
- Just saying.

24:05.250 --> 24:08.583
- So I guess you guys are even
now, huh?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.083
- Not even close.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.542
- [Stasia] What are you up to?

24:14.875 --> 24:16.333
- I don't know.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.667
Drew, what are we up to?

24:20.167 --> 24:21.833
- Look, I'll get her to
pay you back the money

24:21.833 --> 24:24.458
to replace the window if that's
what you're worried about.

24:24.458 --> 24:26.667
- I don't give a shit about the
window.

24:26.667 --> 24:28.958
I want to make her hurt.

24:28.958 --> 24:30.250
- [Colton] We could invite her
to a party

24:30.250 --> 24:33.500
and douse her with beer kind
of like in that movie "Carrie".

24:34.875 --> 24:36.917
- Pig blood, genius.

24:39.292 --> 24:41.292
- Invite her skinny dipping.

24:41.292 --> 24:44.208
Then run off with all her
clothes.

24:51.917 --> 24:54.208
- I'm interested to hear
what Drew has to say.

24:55.375 --> 24:56.208
Drew.

24:58.875 --> 25:00.000
- I don't know.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.958
The skinny dipping thing sounds
good.

25:04.208 --> 25:05.583
Or maybe the "Carrie" thing.

25:06.667 --> 25:09.333
(ominous music)

25:10.958 --> 25:12.875
- I think you can do better than
that.

25:14.375 --> 25:17.042
(ominous music)

25:27.417 --> 25:30.583
(soft dramatic music)

26:04.708 --> 26:08.042
(soft orchestral music)

27:30.667 --> 27:33.833
(soft dramatic music)

28:14.708 --> 28:17.292
(somber music)

28:40.625 --> 28:43.792
(soft dramatic music)

29:19.250 --> 29:21.917
(pensive music)

29:56.125 --> 29:57.417
- Don't bother.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.458
You won't get reception out
here.

30:04.917 --> 30:06.292
- How long have I been out?

30:07.375 --> 30:09.500
- Long enough to get a good
night's sleep.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.125
How are you feeling?

30:15.875 --> 30:17.792
- Ask me again in a few hours.

30:18.708 --> 30:19.583
- That good, huh?

30:26.292 --> 30:27.833
- Where are we?

30:27.833 --> 30:29.792
- Saint Gobnait.

30:29.792 --> 30:30.792
- Saint who?

30:31.667 --> 30:32.500
- Away.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.750
- So is this like your house or
something?

30:38.750 --> 30:39.542
- Family home.

30:40.708 --> 30:45.042
My great, great grandfather
used to run an apiary out here.

30:45.042 --> 30:45.917
- Apiary?

30:48.375 --> 30:49.458
- [Henry] Buenos dias.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.458
- Oh look, another early riser.

31:04.750 --> 31:05.542
- Yup.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.917
Well it's like you say.

31:09.875 --> 31:12.167
Late to bed, late to
rise makes a man healthy,

31:14.458 --> 31:16.500
wealthy and wise, right?

31:16.500 --> 31:18.583
- Yeah, that's not quite how it
goes.

31:19.875 --> 31:24.583
- Well, it should 'cause I
feel like a million bucks.

31:28.292 --> 31:30.125
- Why don't you go and
get yourself presentable

31:30.125 --> 31:32.167
for our guest while I make us
some lunch?

31:33.625 --> 31:34.625
- Aye, aye, Mother.

31:37.750 --> 31:38.583
- Mother?

31:40.833 --> 31:42.958

don't know about me.

34:10.750 --> 34:11.667
Look what I found.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.292
- What is it?

34:14.292 --> 34:15.417
- The hope diamond.

34:15.417 --> 34:16.708
What do you think?

34:16.708 --> 34:19.583
Parts for your new hive.

34:19.583 --> 34:20.875
- No way.

34:22.458 --> 34:25.958
- Thought we'd get your new one
on account of well you know.

34:25.958 --> 34:28.917
Anyway, you have to show me
how to put this thing together.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.417
- This is so great.

34:32.417 --> 34:33.250
- Right?

34:36.458 --> 34:39.125
(pensive music)

35:08.542 --> 35:09.375
- Hey.

35:10.333 --> 35:11.167
- Hey.

35:19.750 --> 35:20.917
It's peaceful out here.

35:24.917 --> 35:25.750
- Yeah.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.042
Guess it is.

35:30.458 --> 35:32.042
How you holding up?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.625
- Okay considering.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.708
- Bet your parents are
worried sick about you, huh?

35:44.708 --> 35:45.542
- [Aster] Good.

35:46.875 --> 35:47.708
- Good?

35:48.917 --> 35:50.125
- Yeah.

35:50.125 --> 35:53.750
It's about time they started
learning how to appreciate me.

35:53.750 --> 35:54.542
- Come on.

35:54.542 --> 35:58.083
I'm sure somebody appreciates
you.

36:00.083 --> 36:02.500
- I know it's so hard to
believe, right?

36:06.333 --> 36:07.458
- What about your mom?

36:09.542 --> 36:10.583
- She's.

36:17.417 --> 36:18.250
- I'm sorry.

36:21.167 --> 36:25.125
- My dad is pretty cool even
if he is married to my stepmom

36:26.250 --> 36:29.458
who I'm sure would be just
fine if I never returned.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.250
- Sounds shitty.

36:36.083 --> 36:38.792
- No shitty is my half sister
Drew.

36:44.958 --> 36:45.792
- Well.

36:47.333 --> 36:50.458
I think it's pretty cool that
you're here.

36:52.917 --> 36:54.042
- Thanks.

36:54.042 --> 36:56.458
(soft music)

37:11.042 --> 37:16.042
(footsteps thudding)
(ominous music)

37:28.042 --> 37:31.208
(soft dramatic music)

37:37.750 --> 37:39.208
- [Tresa] Barn is off limits.

37:40.625 --> 37:41.458
- What?

37:42.375 --> 37:43.208
- The barn.

37:46.250 --> 37:47.917
- Oh, sorry.

37:47.917 --> 37:48.750
I didn't know.

37:50.375 --> 37:53.583
- Everything else is fair
game except the barn.

37:54.667 --> 37:55.500
That's the rule.

37:59.958 --> 38:00.833
- Okay, got it.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.125
- Let's go check out our new
hive.

38:12.500 --> 38:15.167
(ominous music)

38:22.208 --> 38:24.792
(bees buzzing)

38:55.292 --> 38:56.625
- That's amazing.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.875
The swarm must've already found
the box.

38:59.833 --> 39:01.208
- Pretty amazing, all right.

39:02.125 --> 39:04.250
- So many bees.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.083
It's like they've been here for
ages.

39:10.292 --> 39:11.417
- Here, hydrate.

39:13.125 --> 39:15.250
These suits will cook you from
the inside.

39:16.917 --> 39:18.625
So what do you think of Henry?

39:21.500 --> 39:23.417
- Where did that come from?

39:23.417 --> 39:24.625
- Come on.

39:24.625 --> 39:25.625
I see you two.

39:27.625 --> 39:29.458
He's fond of you, you know.

39:29.458 --> 39:30.875
- Calling bullshit on that.

39:32.000 --> 39:32.875
- True story.

39:34.542 --> 39:35.625
I know my son.

39:39.917 --> 39:40.750
- Why would he?

39:40.750 --> 39:42.833
- Are you kidding?

39:42.833 --> 39:43.792
Why wouldn't he?

39:44.667 --> 39:49.292
- Duh because he's
interesting and cool and I'm.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.500
- [Tresa] Your what?

39:53.125 --> 39:54.792
- I'm me.

39:56.583 --> 39:57.958
- Okay, a little advice.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.042
High school isn't the real
world.

40:01.958 --> 40:03.875
Don't make it a bigger deal than
it is.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.333
- I guess it's just hard.

40:07.583 --> 40:09.917
Had a lot of practice downing
myself.

40:18.625 --> 40:19.625
So what do I do?

40:21.333 --> 40:22.917
- About the bees?

40:22.917 --> 40:24.000
- About Henry.

40:26.333 --> 40:30.292
- Are we really discussing
the birds and the bees

40:30.292 --> 40:32.250
while we're tending to
the birds and the bees?

40:32.250 --> 40:33.417
- Just forget it.

40:34.250 --> 40:35.958
- All right, all right, I'm
sorry.

40:37.125 --> 40:41.000
The truth is you don't
have to do anything.

40:42.583 --> 40:44.583
Just let nature take its course.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.375
- You make it sound so easy.

40:49.375 --> 40:50.208
- Because it is.

40:51.917 --> 40:52.750
You'll see.

40:59.042 --> 41:01.458
(soft music)

41:04.458 --> 41:05.292
- Tresa.

41:06.417 --> 41:07.250
Tresa.

41:09.375 --> 41:11.000
- What?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.667
(ominous music)

41:16.542 --> 41:17.458
- [Henry] Oh shit.

41:18.583 --> 41:19.500
She's still here.

41:20.458 --> 41:23.500
(ominous music)

41:23.500 --> 41:26.500
- Is someone going to
tell me what's going on?

41:26.500 --> 41:28.208
(ominous music)

41:28.208 --> 41:29.792
- Nothing I can't take care of.

41:30.833 --> 41:32.917
(ominous music)

41:32.917 --> 41:35.333
(gun firing)

41:46.250 --> 41:51.250
(soft music)
(gun firing)

41:51.667 --> 41:54.083
(soft music)

42:03.542 --> 42:04.542
- Sorry.

42:04.542 --> 42:06.958
(soft music)

42:13.542 --> 42:15.958
(gun firing)

42:22.375 --> 42:25.042
(ominous music)

43:07.833 --> 43:10.417
(bees buzzing)

43:17.708 --> 43:18.875
- Hey, we need to talk.

43:20.042 --> 43:21.042
- Hold that thought.

43:23.667 --> 43:25.833
The queen's laying eggs.

43:25.833 --> 43:27.375
- What?

43:27.375 --> 43:28.750
Hold on, I'll get my suit.

43:30.125 --> 43:32.708
(bees buzzing)

43:51.583 --> 43:53.458
You'll never guess.

43:53.458 --> 43:55.583
- Go away.

43:57.667 --> 43:58.958
- What's wrong with you?

44:00.625 --> 44:01.958
- Just go away.

44:04.750 --> 44:07.458
Don't want you to see me like
this.

44:10.333 --> 44:11.167
- Oh my God.

44:13.667 --> 44:14.500
You're sick.

44:15.458 --> 44:16.750
We need to get you to a doctor.

44:16.750 --> 44:17.667
I'll get Tresa.

44:18.542 --> 44:20.083
Ah.

44:20.083 --> 44:20.917
- No.

44:25.792 --> 44:27.375
Don't tell Tresa.

44:27.375 --> 44:28.958
Please.

44:28.958 --> 44:29.792
- Why?

44:29.792 --> 44:31.042
- Just don't.

44:33.292 --> 44:34.625
For me.

44:34.625 --> 44:37.292
(ominous music)

44:39.042 --> 44:41.875
- If it gets any worse, I'll tie
you up

44:41.875 --> 44:43.542
and drive you to the hospital
myself.

44:44.667 --> 44:45.667
- Deal.

44:45.667 --> 44:48.333
(ominous music)

44:54.500 --> 44:56.917
(soft music)

45:26.375 --> 45:28.000
- [Tresa] Kind of quiet tonight.

45:29.917 --> 45:30.750
- Yeah.

45:34.292 --> 45:35.125
- Yeah.

45:38.917 --> 45:42.000
- Kind of like dining alone
together.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.333
- I know, right?

45:49.625 --> 45:50.458
- Right.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.708
- Aster tell you about the hive?

46:05.750 --> 46:06.583
- Hive?

46:07.625 --> 46:08.750
- You don't know?

46:11.708 --> 46:13.875
I thought surely Aster
would have told you.

46:16.250 --> 46:20.042
- I would have, but we were
interrupted.

46:21.333 --> 46:22.167
- Interrupted?

46:23.417 --> 46:24.750
- Nature and all.

46:26.167 --> 46:28.167
- Oh, I see.

46:35.458 --> 46:36.292
- So.

46:38.333 --> 46:40.667
Tell me about this hive.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.667
(soft dramatic music)

46:50.667 --> 46:52.083
- What's that?

46:52.083 --> 46:53.917
- [Henry] What's what?

46:54.917 --> 46:57.250
- You think I'm stupid.

46:57.250 --> 46:58.750
- No, I swear.

46:58.750 --> 47:01.792
(soft dramatic music)

47:01.792 --> 47:04.917
- How dare you try to deceive me
again?

47:04.917 --> 47:06.500
You don't belong here anymore.

47:06.500 --> 47:07.458
Get out.

47:07.458 --> 47:10.625
(soft dramatic music)

47:11.833 --> 47:12.667
Just go.

47:14.583 --> 47:17.250
(ominous music)

47:21.458 --> 47:23.667
You'll have to excuse me.

47:23.667 --> 47:28.792
(ominous music)
(door thudding)

47:28.792 --> 47:31.958
(soft dramatic music)

48:48.625 --> 48:51.292
(pensive music)

49:43.333 --> 49:45.292
(ominous music)

49:45.292 --> 49:46.125
- Oh.

49:51.542 --> 49:52.375
Oh my god.

49:55.667 --> 49:58.167
You scared the shit out of me.

50:14.458 --> 50:16.458
- Nice to see you again.

50:19.208 --> 50:21.750
- Where have you been?

50:21.750 --> 50:23.167
- Nevermind that.

50:25.833 --> 50:26.958
- God, you're shaking.

50:32.250 --> 50:33.542
I was afraid you left.

50:40.875 --> 50:41.708
- What if I had?

50:45.417 --> 50:46.250
- Left?

50:51.250 --> 50:52.708
- What if I had left

50:56.292 --> 50:59.542
and you never saw me again?

51:01.958 --> 51:04.125
- Little dramatic don't you
think?

51:07.167 --> 51:08.125
- Not really.

51:15.708 --> 51:18.917
- Look, whatever's going
on between you and Tresa,

51:18.917 --> 51:20.333
I'm sure it'll blow over.

51:21.292 --> 51:23.458
My stepmom and I fight all the
time.

51:24.875 --> 51:27.208
- I need you to make me a
promise.

51:29.458 --> 51:31.875
- Do I get to know what
I'm promising first?

51:36.500 --> 51:37.292
- Okay.

51:40.208 --> 51:43.833
Promise me that you

51:45.500 --> 51:49.167
will leave this place tonight.

51:50.417 --> 51:52.833
- [Aster] Wait, I thought
you were begging me to stay.

51:54.458 --> 51:56.250
- You have to trust me.

51:57.708 --> 51:59.125
- Trust you?

51:59.125 --> 52:00.500
- [Henry] Yes, Aster.

52:06.500 --> 52:08.333
- Look, I'll make a deal with
you.

52:09.833 --> 52:11.125
I'll go if you go with me.

52:11.125 --> 52:12.417
- [Henry] I'm being serious.

52:12.417 --> 52:13.583
- So am I.

52:18.792 --> 52:20.250
- What does it even matter?

52:21.250 --> 52:26.083
You're just gonna forget about
me anyway.

52:26.083 --> 52:27.208
- Why do you say that?

52:29.750 --> 52:30.583
- Because.

52:33.167 --> 52:34.000
You.

52:35.375 --> 52:36.208
Will.

52:41.458 --> 52:43.750
- Why are you being so weird
tonight?

52:52.375 --> 52:53.208
- Tresa.

52:58.083 --> 53:03.083
She doesn't think I'm good
enough for you.

53:07.833 --> 53:10.750
- Well, I'm starting to
think Tresa is a crazy bitch.

53:11.750 --> 53:12.667
No offense.

53:15.083 --> 53:15.917
- Yeah.

53:26.625 --> 53:28.958
You ever wish you could live

53:31.458 --> 53:33.375
a lifetime in one night?

53:45.542 --> 53:46.875
- I'd be up to try that.

57:33.208 --> 57:34.042
- No kidding.

57:35.375 --> 57:38.125
- [Tresa] There's something
wrong with the hive.

57:38.125 --> 57:39.042
- The hive?

57:42.292 --> 57:44.958
(ominous music)

57:59.333 --> 58:01.000

yodeling?

58:04.500 --> 58:05.833
I mean, who doesn't?

58:06.792 --> 58:08.958
- [David] What about cuddling?

58:08.958 --> 58:10.958
Is she an expert cuddler?

58:10.958 --> 58:12.292
- I don't know, David.

58:12.292 --> 58:14.458
I didn't think to ask her that
one.

58:24.792 --> 58:25.625
Aster.

58:28.375 --> 58:29.958
Please have a seat.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.292
We're just about to have dinner.

58:53.250 --> 58:54.333
- She's pretty.

58:54.333 --> 58:55.917
- [Tresa] Told you.

59:07.208 --> 59:08.167
- Where's Henry?

59:10.208 --> 59:11.875
- Where are my manners?

59:11.875 --> 59:14.125
David, this is Aster.

59:14.125 --> 59:16.042
Aster, this is David.

59:16.042 --> 59:18.208
He's gonna be staying
with us for a few days.

59:18.208 --> 59:19.042
- [David] Howdy.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.792
- David, did you know
that Aster's into bees?

59:30.792 --> 59:32.125
Pretty much a professional.

59:33.417 --> 59:35.750
- No ma'am, I did not.

59:35.750 --> 59:37.292
Sounds awful smart.

59:39.833 --> 59:44.250
- Aster, did you know that David

59:44.250 --> 59:46.083
is a really talented singer?

59:46.958 --> 59:50.250
- I wouldn't call myself much of
a singer.

59:51.125 --> 59:52.542
A warbler at best.

59:54.208 --> 59:55.583
- Don't be so modest.

59:56.583 --> 59:57.542
Sing her a song.

1:00:00.417 --> 1:00:01.250
- Oh, well.

1:00:33.083 --> 1:00:35.792
- Well, you were the one who
put me on the spot, Mama.

1:00:36.708 --> 1:00:39.667
You can't expect Hank Williams
without so much as a warmup.

1:00:42.833 --> 1:00:44.750
- You'll just have to take my
word for it.

1:00:44.750 --> 1:00:46.083
He really is amazing.

1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:50.292
- I think I'm gonna excuse
myself.

1:00:50.292 --> 1:00:51.583
- Oh honey, don't go.

1:00:54.708 --> 1:00:55.958
- What is all this about?

1:00:57.375 --> 1:00:59.125
- What is what about?

1:01:00.167 --> 1:01:01.250
- This.

1:01:02.917 --> 1:01:06.958
- Look Aster, you just have
to have an open mind, okay.

1:01:08.708 --> 1:01:10.750
- Henry just disappears

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:13.625
and this pervert suddenly
moves into his place.

1:01:13.625 --> 1:01:17.167
No, I'm not gonna keep an open
mind.

1:01:17.167 --> 1:01:19.167
I'm so out of here come morning.

1:01:21.875 --> 1:01:22.708
- Aster.

1:01:31.125 --> 1:01:32.458
That went great.

1:01:34.750 --> 1:01:36.583
- I ain't a pervert.

1:01:37.708 --> 1:01:38.542
Am I, Mama?

1:01:44.250 --> 1:01:47.417
(soft dramatic music)

1:02:06.792 --> 1:02:08.583
- Fucking freak.

1:02:08.583 --> 1:02:11.750
(soft dramatic music)

1:02:55.458 --> 1:03:00.458

1:03:02.417 --> 1:03:05.417
(suspenseful music)

1:03:13.417 --> 1:03:14.417
- Shoot her.

1:03:15.333 --> 1:03:17.000
Shoot her, Mama.

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.250
(suspenseful music)

1:03:20.250 --> 1:03:21.208
What you waiting for?

1:03:21.208 --> 1:03:22.042
Shoot.

1:03:23.458 --> 1:03:24.792
No, your other left.

1:03:24.792 --> 1:03:26.083
Shoot.

1:03:26.083 --> 1:03:27.583
Mama, shoot.

1:03:27.583 --> 1:03:30.583
(suspenseful music)

1:03:57.125 --> 1:04:02.125
(ominous music)
(woman hissing)

1:04:06.417 --> 1:04:07.542
Fuck you, too.

1:04:09.208 --> 1:04:10.042
- Who is she?

1:04:12.417 --> 1:04:13.542
- A mistake.

1:04:16.542 --> 1:04:17.708
- Her stomach.

1:04:19.250 --> 1:04:20.292
Is she pregnant?

1:04:22.042 --> 1:04:23.125
- How should I know?

1:04:24.042 --> 1:04:25.125
I'm no doctor.

1:04:27.250 --> 1:04:30.167
- Seems like a couple of late
term abortions are in order.

1:04:30.167 --> 1:04:31.833
- No, one's aborting anything.

1:04:32.875 --> 1:04:35.792
- She sure didn't seem to
have a qualm with doing it.

1:04:35.792 --> 1:04:37.500
- Be that as it may.

1:04:39.958 --> 1:04:41.208
- I'm with David.

1:04:42.208 --> 1:04:44.208
This one's past due.

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:45.042
- You too?

1:04:47.583 --> 1:04:48.417
Wait.

1:04:48.417 --> 1:04:49.958
Hold on.

1:04:49.958 --> 1:04:51.625
- [Tresa] Get out of the way,
Aster.

1:04:51.625 --> 1:04:55.208
- No, wait, we talk about
this like human beings.

1:04:55.208 --> 1:05:00.208
(soft dramatic music)
(woman hissing)

1:05:18.167 --> 1:05:19.542
- So what do you make of it?

1:05:21.833 --> 1:05:22.667
- [Aster] Her?

1:05:24.625 --> 1:05:25.750
- No, the hive.

1:05:29.875 --> 1:05:31.583
- [Aster] I don't know.

1:05:31.583 --> 1:05:33.625
Maybe Nosema, maybe something
else.

1:05:34.958 --> 1:05:36.583
- So what's the treatment, doc?

1:05:41.583 --> 1:05:42.542
Aster.

1:05:44.167 --> 1:05:45.000
Treatment?

1:05:47.583 --> 1:05:48.542
- Burn it down.

1:05:49.542 --> 1:05:50.500
Start over.

1:05:52.167 --> 1:05:53.875
- Burn it down.

1:05:53.875 --> 1:05:57.042
(soft dramatic music)

1:05:58.542 --> 1:05:59.708
- I need to find Henry.

1:06:01.458 --> 1:06:02.583
- Hate to crash the party,

1:06:02.583 --> 1:06:05.917
but what about Miss
Congeniality in the other room?

1:06:05.917 --> 1:06:08.208
(soft dramatic music)

1:06:08.208 --> 1:06:09.333
- Burn it down.

1:06:10.625 --> 1:06:11.625
Start over.

1:06:12.583 --> 1:06:14.125
- I was talking about the hive.

1:06:17.125 --> 1:06:18.125
- I know you were.

1:06:19.417 --> 1:06:22.583
(soft dramatic music)

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:54.833
(water splattering)

1:07:04.167 --> 1:07:05.250
- It's okay.

1:07:06.625 --> 1:07:07.625
It's just a rag.

1:07:08.958 --> 1:07:09.792
See?

1:07:30.750 --> 1:07:35.750
(soft dramatic music)
(woman screaming)

1:08:01.625 --> 1:08:02.708
Are you okay?

1:08:05.167 --> 1:08:06.583
Oh my god.

1:08:06.583 --> 1:08:09.750
(soft dramatic music)

1:08:15.125 --> 1:08:15.958
Hey.

1:08:18.166 --> 1:08:19.333
Hey, you okay?

1:08:20.416 --> 1:08:21.250
Hey.

1:08:23.416 --> 1:08:28.416
(soft dramatic music)
(water splattering)

1:08:41.333 --> 1:08:43.333
- What's all the racket?

1:08:43.333 --> 1:08:45.333
- Holy shit.

1:08:45.333 --> 1:08:46.791
It looks like you won first
place

1:08:46.791 --> 1:08:48.500
at a pig slaughter contest.

1:08:48.500 --> 1:08:50.875
- She needs medical attention.

1:08:52.291 --> 1:08:53.291
- You think?

1:08:55.125 --> 1:08:56.500
- You guys, give me a hand.

1:08:57.500 --> 1:09:00.666
(soft dramatic music)

1:09:03.083 --> 1:09:04.083
She's dying.

1:09:06.333 --> 1:09:08.333
- Nature can be a cruel
mistress.

1:09:10.083 --> 1:09:13.250
(soft dramatic music)

1:09:18.875 --> 1:09:20.750
- It really is for the best.

1:09:20.750 --> 1:09:21.541
- David.

1:09:22.625 --> 1:09:24.000
Please help me.

1:09:26.458 --> 1:09:28.458
- It's in God's hands now,
darling.

1:09:29.625 --> 1:09:32.791
(soft dramatic music)

1:09:56.958 --> 1:09:58.833
- She's not going to last much
longer.

1:10:00.833 --> 1:10:02.000
She needs help.

1:10:03.083 --> 1:10:04.875
- We are helping.

1:10:04.875 --> 1:10:06.208
- [Aster] How?

1:10:06.208 --> 1:10:08.208
By standing around watching her
die?

1:10:09.583 --> 1:10:11.041
- By burning down the hive.

1:10:13.333 --> 1:10:15.000
- What aren't you getting?

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.875
There's a person dying in there.

1:10:16.875 --> 1:10:18.208
Literally dying.

1:10:19.875 --> 1:10:21.250
- Burn it down.

1:10:21.250 --> 1:10:22.958
Start over.

1:10:22.958 --> 1:10:24.041
That's what you said.

1:10:26.333 --> 1:10:27.291
- You're one sick bitch.

1:10:27.291 --> 1:10:28.125
You know that?

1:10:29.750 --> 1:10:32.416
(ominous music)

1:10:35.625 --> 1:10:37.791
- Now you're getting it.

1:10:37.791 --> 1:10:40.458
(ominous music)

1:10:52.583 --> 1:10:55.333
(fire crackling)

1:11:10.458 --> 1:11:15.458
- I want to help you,
but I need to trust you.

1:11:25.291 --> 1:11:28.291
(suspenseful music)

1:11:46.791 --> 1:11:48.208
Shit.

1:11:48.208 --> 1:11:51.208
(suspenseful music)

1:12:16.041 --> 1:12:18.041
Jesus, you're heavy.

1:12:18.041 --> 1:12:21.041
(suspenseful music)

1:12:43.208 --> 1:12:44.458
What was that?

1:12:44.458 --> 1:12:47.041
(ominous music)

1:12:47.041 --> 1:12:48.208
Shit.

1:12:48.208 --> 1:12:51.208
(suspenseful music)

1:13:45.708 --> 1:13:46.541
- Sh.

1:13:51.791 --> 1:13:54.458
(ominous music)

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:41.000
(girl screaming)
(suspenseful music)

1:15:08.291 --> 1:15:10.958
(ominous music)

1:15:38.125 --> 1:15:39.791
- What's the matter?

1:15:40.666 --> 1:15:42.458
Is my pretty girl sick?

1:15:43.875 --> 1:15:46.541
(ominous music)

1:16:12.041 --> 1:16:13.375
What's the matter?

1:16:14.833 --> 1:16:17.916
I ain't good enough for you,
princess?

1:16:20.875 --> 1:16:21.916
We'll see about that.

1:16:23.416 --> 1:16:26.083
(ominous music)

1:16:37.333 --> 1:16:39.166
Ma, Mama.

1:16:41.125 --> 1:16:42.500
- [Tresa] You done already?

1:16:43.333 --> 1:16:44.541
- Mama, look.

1:16:44.541 --> 1:16:47.208
(ominous music)

1:16:59.166 --> 1:17:00.000
- Whore.

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.250
Stupid little whore (screams).

1:17:11.458 --> 1:17:14.208
I'm gonna breed you and breed
you

1:17:16.416 --> 1:17:18.833
'til you can't breed anymore.

1:17:20.208 --> 1:17:22.791
Then I'm gonna kill you myself.

1:17:25.583 --> 1:17:28.750
(soft dramatic music)

1:18:19.583 --> 1:18:24.583
(ominous music)
(girl groaning)

1:18:47.541 --> 1:18:52.541
(girl screaming)
(ominous music)

1:19:38.916 --> 1:19:41.500
(somber music)

1:20:34.500 --> 1:20:37.166
(ominous music)

1:21:09.875 --> 1:21:14.875
(woman humming)
(ominous music)

1:21:56.875 --> 1:21:58.291
- Do you like it?

1:22:05.291 --> 1:22:06.833
It's all for you.

1:22:22.833 --> 1:22:26.000
(soft dramatic music)

1:22:29.708 --> 1:22:31.916
I've loved you from the moment I
saw you.

1:22:33.750 --> 1:22:36.916
(soft dramatic music)

1:23:14.583 --> 1:23:17.125
(belt clanking)

1:23:17.125 --> 1:23:20.291
(soft dramatic music)

1:23:22.916 --> 1:23:24.416
Don't worry.

1:23:24.416 --> 1:23:26.083
I got real good DNA.

1:23:27.541 --> 1:23:28.791
Not like Henry.

1:23:30.791 --> 1:23:33.791
(suspenseful music)

1:24:31.791 --> 1:24:33.916
- I moved heaven and earth to
find you.

1:24:35.333 --> 1:24:38.333
(suspenseful music)

1:24:40.750 --> 1:24:43.000
I killed for you.

1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:46.000
(suspenseful music)

1:24:49.416 --> 1:24:52.166
Gave my offspring for you.

1:24:52.166 --> 1:24:55.166
(suspenseful music)

1:24:57.833 --> 1:24:59.666
You were a loser.

1:24:59.666 --> 1:25:03.166
(suspenseful music)

1:25:03.166 --> 1:25:06.333
I offered you everything.

1:25:06.333 --> 1:25:09.791
(suspenseful music)

1:25:09.791 --> 1:25:11.375
You could have been a queen.

1:25:14.125 --> 1:25:16.791
(ominous music)

1:25:26.958 --> 1:25:29.958
(suspenseful music)

1:25:59.750 --> 1:26:02.500
(dramatic music)

1:27:06.458 --> 1:27:09.458
(suspenseful music)

1:27:27.041 --> 1:27:29.791
(dramatic music)

1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:36.500
(suspenseful music)

1:28:05.583 --> 1:28:08.250
(pensive music)

1:28:16.541 --> 1:28:19.541
(suspenseful music)

1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:43.166
(ominous music)

1:29:01.958 --> 1:29:05.125
(soft dramatic music)

1:29:09.958 --> 1:29:12.958
(suspenseful music)

1:29:29.750 --> 1:29:32.916
(soft dramatic music)

1:30:29.083 --> 1:30:32.666
(dramatic music continues)

1:31:01.166 --> 1:31:04.000
(energetic music)

1:32:01.041 --> 1:32:04.708
(energetic music continues)

1:33:01.166 --> 1:33:04.833
(energetic music continues)

1:33:33.291 --> 1:33:34.208
- Okay.

1:33:34.208 --> 1:33:35.750
So like bees are important,
right?

1:33:35.750 --> 1:33:40.208
That's cool, but I'm so
over talking about them.

1:33:40.208 --> 1:33:42.458
It's like, let them live their
lives.

1:33:42.458 --> 1:33:44.083
Let me live mine.

1:33:44.083 --> 1:33:46.375
But apparently we need bees to
live.

1:33:46.375 --> 1:33:49.166
Like they're part of the life
cycle

1:33:49.166 --> 1:33:51.750
and I guess we're not letting
them live their lives.

1:33:51.750 --> 1:33:54.833
So, now we have to do something
about it.

1:33:54.833 --> 1:33:58.208
When we don't take care of bees,
they can't take care of us,

1:33:58.208 --> 1:34:00.125
which means they can't take care
of me.

1:34:00.125 --> 1:34:01.750
And that's a problem.

1:34:01.750 --> 1:34:06.041
So get your cells out, scan this
QR code,

1:34:06.041 --> 1:34:09.333
and send an email with
the subject bee better

1:34:09.333 --> 1:34:10.625
and we'll send you all the buzz

1:34:10.625 --> 1:34:12.458
on how to support the bees.

1:34:12.458 --> 1:34:15.208
BT dubs, we're doing our part.

1:34:15.208 --> 1:34:17.208
Remember that time we hurt Aster

1:34:17.208 --> 1:34:19.375
and looked flawless doing it?

1:34:19.375 --> 1:34:21.916
Well, our iconic hoodies are on
sale

1:34:21.916 --> 1:34:25.583
and a portion of the
proceeds will be pro bees.

1:34:25.583 --> 1:34:28.375
Do your part and save the bees.

1:34:28.375 --> 1:34:30.958
(bright music)
