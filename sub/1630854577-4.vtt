WEBVTT

00:40.749 --> 00:41.666
Look...

00:46.713 --> 00:50.383
Let's go! Food, water, supplies,
whatever you can find.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.469
Quiet and quick!

01:09.903 --> 01:11.571
Run!

01:36.387 --> 01:39.766
Oh, I really gotta start
landing on my feet.

01:39.849 --> 01:40.809
What?

01:43.728 --> 01:45.688
Where am I? Nine?

01:46.397 --> 01:48.983
Nine? Are you out there, buddy?

01:49.442 --> 01:50.485
Rebel?

01:50.985 --> 01:53.613
Heck, I'd even take Knucks at this point.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.406
Is this a city park?

01:55.490 --> 01:57.826
Huh, I wonder
if the Rebels know about this?

02:00.411 --> 02:01.871
Whoa.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.957
My kicks and gloves have a new look.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.583
But why?

02:07.335 --> 02:08.753
Okay, Sonic, think.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.297
It's not like answers
are just gonna fall from the sky--

02:11.381 --> 02:13.800
-Run!

02:17.053 --> 02:18.555
There you are!

02:27.355 --> 02:30.191
I told you it was too dangerous.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.277
We should make due with what we have.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.405
We got nothing! I'm starving!

02:35.488 --> 02:37.615
We're wasting away up here!

02:37.699 --> 02:39.159
Not anytime soon.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.539
-Ah! Gimme, gimme, gimme!
-Back off!

02:44.622 --> 02:47.417
Unless you got something to trade.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.544
Guys! Can you hear me?

02:49.627 --> 02:51.671
Wait-- do you hear something?

02:51.754 --> 02:55.967
It's the trees! They're talkin' to us!

02:56.050 --> 02:58.469
We've already been over this.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.388
Trees don't speak.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.765
Yeah, that's what they want you to think.

03:05.143 --> 03:09.272
Guys! Guys! Where are you?

03:09.355 --> 03:10.732
Huh?

03:13.484 --> 03:15.403
My berry!

03:24.704 --> 03:27.165
No!

03:30.752 --> 03:33.922
Yep, we're wasting away.

03:38.968 --> 03:43.181
Rebel, Knucks, and... Big?
What are you doing here?

03:43.264 --> 03:46.684
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.
And where are we?

03:46.768 --> 03:48.937
And any sign of Nine?

03:49.020 --> 03:52.440
And why are you dressed
like cave people exactly?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.069
Now that's new.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.196
He's here for our supplies.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.031
Oh, no!

04:05.620 --> 04:08.248
Huh?

04:08.331 --> 04:11.292
Oh, so that's what you do. Huh!

04:13.002 --> 04:15.088
What's gotten into you?

04:15.171 --> 04:17.799
Do you have you any idea
what I've just been through?

04:27.141 --> 04:31.062
And then I ran into you guys,
which pretty much brings you up to speed.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.605
No one asked you.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.528
Everyone, just calm down
so I can stop my brain from exploding.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.364
Whoa!

04:41.447 --> 04:43.283
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

04:48.705 --> 04:53.376
Now a minute ago we were battling robots
in New Yoke city, right?

04:55.837 --> 04:57.797
Huh? What's a ro-butt?

05:18.401 --> 05:20.945
Hey, hey, hey, wait!
I'm not the bad guy here.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.655
We're friends!

05:22.739 --> 05:25.825
They don't know who I am. Again!

05:26.617 --> 05:30.163
Which means I'm not in New Yoke,
I'm in a whole new place

05:30.246 --> 05:32.248
and you're all-new you's and...

05:32.332 --> 05:34.584
Oh, not again!

05:36.336 --> 05:39.380
So this is another altered green hill.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.758
At least this one has plants.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.927
Yeah... the Boscage maze
has super-sized plants

05:45.011 --> 05:47.263
that are suffocating
the life out of this place.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.639
Thanks to the monster.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.850
Monster? Hmm.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.979
Yeah, it does look extra healthy,
doesn't it?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.856
Extra healthy isn't how I'd put it.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.983
The trees are so big,
they're squeezing us out

05:59.067 --> 06:01.861
and the monster won't let us
touch whatever food is left.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.947
Monsters, overgrown trees, lost shards...

06:05.031 --> 06:06.115
Tricky situation.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.160
There's only one person
who could help me figure this out.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.621
-I gotta find--

06:13.790 --> 06:15.958
Tails? Tails!

06:18.336 --> 06:20.254
-Gotcha!

06:20.338 --> 06:22.507
He's fast.

06:22.590 --> 06:26.385
Fast enough to occupy the monster
while we grab what we need.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.723
Am I glad to see you!
The world is all...

06:30.807 --> 06:32.016
You gotta figure out what's going--

06:35.603 --> 06:38.439
-Ow! You mangey little--

06:39.774 --> 06:43.236
Hey, give it a rest. He just saved you.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.823
Thanks for your help, stranger.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.909
It's Sonic and you're welcome.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.703
But why didn't he just fly
with all his tails?

06:52.787 --> 06:55.706
Fly? Mangey doesn't fly.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.667
Wait, "Mangey"? Really?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.127
And I'm Prim.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.461
Hangry.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.839
Gnarly. But you already knew that.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.048
Didn't ya? Who sent you?

07:04.132 --> 07:06.092
Look, you all seem like a lovely group,

07:06.175 --> 07:09.137
but I'm trying to find my way back home
and I'm looking for some answers.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.514
Do any of you know
about the paradox prism?

07:13.224 --> 07:16.185
Okay... how about a shiny crystal shard

07:16.269 --> 07:18.521
that may or may not have
some really weird powers.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.731
It's the only clue I have
to getting back home.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.276
A shard? We don't know--

07:23.359 --> 07:26.696
Why you waited so long to ask us about it.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.448
So you know where it is.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.450
-Can you take me to it?
-Of course.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.202
But first come to our village.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.246
I'm sure we can help each other.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.127
We didn't always live in the Canopy.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.212
For years, we lived on the ground,

07:43.296 --> 07:46.132
took everything we needed
from the jungle to survive.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.469
And then, the monster drove us
up into the trees.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.763
Every day in the Boscage maze
is a struggle to survive.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.891
-It's miserable!
-Whoa! Easy!

07:54.974 --> 07:56.476
No need to get angry.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.895
I'm not angry! I'm hungry.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.522
You ever tried filling up on bark?

08:01.606 --> 08:05.818
"Bark"? Don't any of the trees
have fruit or nuts or something?

08:05.902 --> 08:07.987
They used to, but they're tapped out.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.365
That's why we have to forage below,
despite the monster.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.367
We're here.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.995
This is your village?

08:16.078 --> 08:18.331
Hey! Get away from my house.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.959
Your-- I mean, it's very rustic.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.551
Ah-ah-ah! Hold that thought.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.057
Sonic, we'll take you to the-the-- uh--

08:36.140 --> 08:38.059
-Shard.
-Exactly!

08:38.142 --> 08:41.687
But... first you'll help us
by taking care of the monster

08:41.771 --> 08:43.147
so we can gather supplies.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.906
Deal?

08:51.989 --> 08:55.034
Oof! These guys really need some help.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.994
Good news, everyone!

08:57.078 --> 09:00.039
Guess which special guest can
handle a so-called monster

09:00.122 --> 09:02.041
without even breaking a sweat?

09:04.961 --> 09:07.588
It's me. It's obviously me.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.552
I'll help you. Berries for all,
as many as you want!

09:12.635 --> 09:15.846
You mean we could have two berries?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.951
That's the loop-de-loop.

09:37.034 --> 09:41.163
You were not kidding about the plants.
They look even bigger from down here.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.333
-Shh!
-Right! Stealth mission.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.856
We need to be very quiet.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.649
The monster could be anywhere.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.203
Hey! I found one!

10:21.287 --> 10:24.040
-I guess it's our lucky day.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.506
Whoa! You know, you might wanna
take it easy on the plants.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.925
Why are you on the plants' side?

10:35.009 --> 10:36.719
They've gotten to you.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.271
So much for being quiet.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.815
Shh! Do you wanna get us all killed?

10:49.899 --> 10:51.901
-Wait, wha-- but, uh, he--
-Shh!

11:12.380 --> 11:13.297
Run!

11:16.133 --> 11:19.261
Not you! Go deal with the monster!

11:19.345 --> 11:20.971
Right! I'll deal with the monster.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.598
You go find those berries.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.518
All right, monster, show yourself!

11:35.194 --> 11:36.987
I'm right here. Come and get me!

11:47.998 --> 11:49.166
Run!

12:04.849 --> 12:06.642
The berry patch! I found it!

12:07.893 --> 12:09.019
Hey, guys!

12:09.103 --> 12:11.647
-[screams[

12:14.984 --> 12:18.070
Whoa! Okay, so you're pretty quick.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.613
But how quick?

12:21.740 --> 12:22.783
Whoa!

12:26.328 --> 12:28.080
What's back there?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.166
Show yourself, monster!

12:30.249 --> 12:31.500
-Yikes!

12:31.584 --> 12:33.627
On second thought,
you're scary enough as is.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.884
Whoa!

12:40.759 --> 12:43.304
This place needs
a monster-sized weed whacker!

12:43.387 --> 12:45.097
I can't hit the gas.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.354
That's it! Enough running.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.775
Can't fight what I can't see.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.487
But... I've got other senses.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.450
There you go.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.046
You're no monster.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.923
You're just a giant flicky!

13:21.467 --> 13:23.469
You're gonna regret saying that.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.223
Gotcha!

13:27.306 --> 13:30.559
-You wanna dance? Let's party!

13:51.330 --> 13:53.832
Ha! And stay down!

13:53.916 --> 13:56.627
You can come down now,
I defeated the monster.

13:56.710 --> 14:00.297
That's not the monster.
That's the monster's pet!

14:00.381 --> 14:01.382
Say what now?

14:07.221 --> 14:08.180
Whaaa!

14:09.306 --> 14:11.392
Ow!

14:11.475 --> 14:14.353
Spikes? I hate spikes!

14:42.256 --> 14:44.008
Whoa!

14:52.766 --> 14:56.854
Amy? You're the monster?

14:56.937 --> 15:00.941
Ugh, oh, those guys up above
have really got it--

15:01.025 --> 15:02.610
--wrong.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.864
You hurt my jungle! I hurt you!

15:06.947 --> 15:11.785
Amy, stop! We're friends!
You liked me, to some extent.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.082
Get out!

15:17.166 --> 15:19.793
Maybe not so powerful after all.
Am I right?

15:30.346 --> 15:32.681
And stay out!

15:40.940 --> 15:42.900
First rusty, now this?

16:01.377 --> 16:03.337
Oh, Amy...

16:03.420 --> 16:05.255
I can't smash you.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.842
Ow! Quick recap.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.471
I'm not from around here.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.267
Violence never solves anything.

16:17.351 --> 16:21.188
And where I'm from, you and I are buds.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.694
So how about you put down your big hammer
and just talk, Amy?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.781
My name is Thorn Rose,

16:30.864 --> 16:33.951
and you are finished!

16:41.959 --> 16:44.086
-Ugh!

16:49.008 --> 16:52.678
There you go.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.681
You're free now, little flickies.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.270
What happened here?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.401
You're what happened here.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.654
You and your kind above,
hacked and slashed,

17:10.738 --> 17:12.322
and nearly destroyed it all!

17:12.406 --> 17:14.199
My kind?

17:14.283 --> 17:17.036
You scavengers took everything
the jungle had to offer

17:17.119 --> 17:18.370
and left this.

17:22.666 --> 17:26.128
I'm bringing back nature.
By force, if I have to!

17:30.424 --> 17:34.053
That's right! Mine now!

17:36.346 --> 17:37.556
That glow.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.809
Huh? Yes!

17:40.893 --> 17:43.103
That means there's
gotta be a shard nearby.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.857
Shard? No! I've seen that before.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.901
It looks like the great green.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.320
It's pretty powerful stuff.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.281
Can you help me find this "great green"?

17:54.364 --> 17:57.910
This jungle's been giving me,
uh, a little bit of trouble.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.582
Look, I believe it can
help me get back home

18:03.665 --> 18:05.459
and then I'll be outta your hair.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.886
Fine. I'll help you.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.430
As long as it means
you're out of my jungle.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.183
-For good.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.898
You say
the scavengers did all this?

18:27.981 --> 18:32.903
Yes. We all used to live together
in harmony with nature.

18:32.986 --> 18:36.073
But then they got greedy, always taking,

18:36.156 --> 18:39.785
never considering the harm
they were doing to the world around them.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.788
So that's why you
chased them off and went all...

18:42.871 --> 18:44.331
whatever this is.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.418
Hey! I meant it as a compliment.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.630
I mean, this is way less creepy
than the last you I met.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.967
-Last me?
-It's a long story.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.636
If you used to live in harmony
with the others,

18:57.719 --> 18:59.304
why don't you just bring
everybody together

18:59.388 --> 19:01.306
and, you know, work it out?

19:01.390 --> 19:03.267
They deserve to survive too, yeah?

19:03.350 --> 19:05.602
Do you ever stop talking?

19:05.686 --> 19:07.521
Eh, not really.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.404
Don't like this one bit.

19:15.487 --> 19:20.200
-Where is he going with the monster?
-He's betrayed us.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.164
Ow!

19:31.378 --> 19:35.424
Listen, I get that you and the tree peeps
don't see eye-to-eye on stuff.

19:38.802 --> 19:42.264
But isn't calling them scavengers
a little... dark?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.853
What else would I call them?

19:47.936 --> 19:49.730
I don't know, how about

19:49.813 --> 19:52.858
happy, happy, fun upstairs
people just tryin' to live?

19:53.692 --> 19:57.237
There's nothing fun about destruction.
It's all they know.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.711
How do you make your way
through all these thorns?

20:14.087 --> 20:15.255
This way!

20:19.426 --> 20:22.429
Behold... the great green!

20:25.766 --> 20:27.851
The palm... It's--

20:27.935 --> 20:30.520
Magnificent? Yes.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.023
Now do your thing
and get out of my jungle!

20:38.445 --> 20:41.740
If my kicks are right,
and they always are,

20:41.823 --> 20:44.284
the shard is buried down here.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.623
I found it!

20:50.666 --> 20:54.044
But I can't touch it or I...
you know, poof!

21:00.592 --> 21:02.219
Magnificent!

21:04.012 --> 21:06.807
Yeah, it's pretty,
but trust me, this thing is--

21:06.890 --> 21:07.808
Mine!

21:12.604 --> 21:15.190
Ohh!

21:22.072 --> 21:24.283
I really should have seen that coming.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.294
No! What are you doing? I need that!

21:35.377 --> 21:38.964
As if I would give the heart
of my jungle to a stranger.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.843
You're just another scavenger
like the rest of them.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.303
Hi-yah!
