WEBVTT

00:37.912 --> 00:38.913
I got it.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.415
Open it!

00:41.458 --> 00:43.293
Mr. Dudley says this is a master key,

00:43.376 --> 00:46.046
so it's supposed to open
any door in the house.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.839
What do you think is in there?

00:48.715 --> 00:51.009
What if it's a cotton candy machine?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.469
That'd be something.

00:52.635 --> 00:53.803
Or a pony?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.055
Not a pony.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.187
This isn't working.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.148
It could be a pony.
Something was moving.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.442
I saw the shadow under the door.

01:10.987 --> 01:11.863
Hello?

01:13.114 --> 01:15.492
If there's a pony in there, it's dead.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.919
Where's the friggin' key?

01:26.002 --> 01:27.962
-Don't say that word.
-You say it.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.180
I want to see what's in there, too.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.561
Daddy, we need more keys!

01:43.686 --> 01:45.438
It's an emergency!

01:51.402 --> 01:52.695
You're not funny, Luke.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.061
I am home.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.110
I am home, I thought,

03:14.819 --> 03:16.779
and stopped in wonder at the thought.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.740
I am home.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.658
I am home.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.122
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.041
How was it?

03:28.124 --> 03:30.293
It was great. Kelly says hi.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.794
Her boys are huge.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.504
You were missed.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.589
I was going to cook.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.342
I know, but she wants fries.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.427
All the fries. Nothing but fries.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.264
How's the writing?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.559
Slow, it's really slow.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.311
How much since I left?

03:48.937 --> 03:49.771
Two...

03:50.396 --> 03:51.272
pages.

03:51.522 --> 03:52.398
Ouch.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.693
I always said, I'm never gonna do
a follow-up to Hill House

03:55.777 --> 03:58.071
and I think this is why. It's just--

03:58.238 --> 03:59.155
Eat.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.157
It's the best cure for writer's block.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.867
Don't use those words.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.786
Fries, nothing but fries.

04:06.704 --> 04:07.664
Read me something.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.841
"Certainly there are places
which attach to themselves

04:18.925 --> 04:22.053
an atmosphere of holiness and goodness.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.473
It might also be said that some houses

04:26.099 --> 04:27.225
are born bad."

04:28.309 --> 04:29.185
"Born bad"?

04:29.519 --> 04:30.353
Too much?

04:30.770 --> 04:32.730
Hmm. It depends. Where are you?

04:34.941 --> 04:36.693
Dad and I just got to the house,

04:36.776 --> 04:37.610
and, um,

04:37.986 --> 04:40.697
we know Luke bought the gasoline,
and...

04:40.780 --> 04:41.781
Oh, honey.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.283
We're about to go inside.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.202
You don't have to do this, you know?

04:46.577 --> 04:48.871
You said yourself,
you were never gonna publish it.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.206
I do, though.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.209
To see it, to really see it.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.129
Here.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.718
You feel that?

05:03.344 --> 05:05.054
-Mmm.
-That little girl in there,

05:06.055 --> 05:08.099
who's getting ready to join this family,

05:08.349 --> 05:10.852
one day she's going to ask
about her grandfather

05:10.935 --> 05:12.353
and about her Uncle Luke,

05:13.313 --> 05:14.981
and what happened in that house.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.985
She's going to hear
all sorts of stories and speculation

05:19.068 --> 05:21.154
like you did when you were little, but...

05:22.113 --> 05:23.489
whose voice did you need?

05:25.241 --> 05:28.202
Whose story did you need to hear the most?

05:29.495 --> 05:31.414
She needs to hear this from you.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.585
This is for little Eleanor.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.061
This house, which seemed somehow
to have formed itself,

05:53.311 --> 05:55.730
flying together in its own
powerful pattern

05:55.813 --> 05:57.607
under the hands of its builders...

05:59.442 --> 06:04.364
reared its great head back against the sky
without concession to humanity.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.992
It was a house without kindness,

06:09.327 --> 06:10.870
never meant to be lived in,

06:12.330 --> 06:15.291
not a fit place for people, or for love,

06:15.583 --> 06:16.626
or for hope.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.479
-You smell that?
-Yeah.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.189
Gasoline.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.191
Yeah.

06:40.942 --> 06:41.859
All right.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.444
If he's here,

06:44.529 --> 06:46.197
I think I know where to find him.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.367
Dad.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.452
It's okay.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.079
Come on.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.657
Look at me.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.000
Fear.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.128
Look at me.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.673
Fear is the relinquishment of logic,

07:46.799 --> 07:49.760
the willing relinquishing
of reasonable patterns.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.181
We yield to it or we fight it.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.933
But we cannot meet it halfway.

08:14.911 --> 08:15.745
Okay.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.499
I am home.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.627
"I am home," I thought,

08:23.377 --> 08:25.338
and stopped in wonder at the thought.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.298
I am home.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.342
I am home.

08:30.843 --> 08:31.886
Now to climb.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.472
Luke! Luke!

08:34.847 --> 08:35.806
Dad.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.309
-That door has always been locked.
-Yeah.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.977
Only when it wants to be.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.063
Take off the hinges.
How hard can it be?

08:42.146 --> 08:43.439
But I tried everything.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.401
Maybe with the two of us...

08:48.319 --> 08:49.195
Dad!

08:50.029 --> 08:51.322
Steve, wait!

08:56.452 --> 08:57.370
You okay?

08:57.954 --> 08:59.664
Yeah, I just need a break.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.999
Why don't you come to bed?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.294
Get some sleep.
Hill House will be there in the morning.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.340
I know it's hard.
It's too much right now.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.342
Why don't you put this down

09:12.051 --> 09:15.012
come to bed,
and leave the ghosts where they belong.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.013
That's--

09:16.264 --> 09:17.431
That's not the problem.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.435
Where are you now?

09:22.937 --> 09:25.481
Well, we... we went into the house.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.901
And then we went to the Red Room.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.362
And then the...

09:31.445 --> 09:33.698
the door opened and I saw Luke,
and then--

09:33.864 --> 09:34.824
Luke died.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.496
No.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.498
He-- He was alive on the floor.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.126
And then the door closed,

09:45.543 --> 09:46.544
and...

09:49.422 --> 09:50.464
And then he died.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.260
You have to say it.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.887
You gotta finally say it, Steve.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.348
-That's the problem.
-I know.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.934
The door closed and then I...

10:03.227 --> 10:04.228
I-- I, uh--

10:04.312 --> 10:05.771
I can't say what happened.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.941
It's still too soon.
Why don't you come to bed?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.235
No, Leigh, I mean, I--

10:11.527 --> 10:15.197
I can't say what happened
after the door closed.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.952
I don't remember.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.081
I mean, how I got out of the house.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.795
I-- I don't remember coming back
to California.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.465
I don't remember us...

10:34.258 --> 10:35.343
reconciling.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.722
Or finding out you were pregnant.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.728
Well, of course you don't.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.648
Because you haven't written it yet.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.194
I mean, is anything real
before you write it, Steve?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.988
The things you write about are real,
those people are real,

10:56.072 --> 10:58.074
their feelings are real,
their pain is real,

10:58.157 --> 10:59.992
but not to you, is it?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.329
Not until you chew it up
and you digest it

11:03.412 --> 11:05.665
and you shit it out on a piece of paper.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.918
And even then,
it's a pale imitation at best.

11:09.001 --> 11:13.005
You take other people's lives
and love and loss and pain,

11:13.506 --> 11:14.882
and you eat it, Steve.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.259
You are an eater.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.679
You eat it and you shit it out,

11:19.845 --> 11:22.098
and then, and only then,
is it real for you.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.477
Normal people's lives are flesh and blood
and muscle and bone,

11:26.560 --> 11:28.646
but not yours, darling. Oh, no.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.648
Your life is plastic.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.567
You are a plastic parasite.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.404
A plastic hack, aren't you, honey?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.407
So of course you don't remember
how you healed our marriage

11:39.490 --> 11:42.326
or made our baby,
because you haven't really seen it.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.371
Have you?
You haven't shat it out in prose.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.667
I was always a supporting player
in your story, if we're honest.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.169
I would feed you and fuck you
and pay the bills

11:52.253 --> 11:56.006
while you squinted over some novel
that nobody was going to read or publish,

11:56.090 --> 11:58.801
but I paid you to write them, didn't I?

11:59.218 --> 12:01.137
I picked up the check for your dreams

12:01.220 --> 12:03.931
and I said goodbye to mine,
and not even that was enough.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.100
Don't lie to me, honey. I wasn't real.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.854
If I was real, you never would have
walked out that door,

12:09.937 --> 12:13.190
but I wasn't, and you did,
and now this one...

12:14.900 --> 12:15.735
this...

12:16.777 --> 12:17.945
little one...

12:20.030 --> 12:21.699
she won't be real either.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.326
Oh.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.661
She's kicking.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.079
Oh, she's hungry.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.623
She must be an eater like her dad.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.461
If she is, my love,

12:33.544 --> 12:36.172
if she eats me from the inside

12:36.505 --> 12:38.674
and I burst like a blister,

12:39.967 --> 12:41.218
will you lose your mind?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.389
Like your mother?

12:46.932 --> 12:47.850
Steve.

13:00.821 --> 13:01.697
Luke.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.909
Luke. Oh, God.

13:04.992 --> 13:05.993
Oh, my God.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.204
No, no, no.

13:08.871 --> 13:09.789
Luke.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.088
Come on.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.082
Mom.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.778
I couldn't help her.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.824
Look, listen, I know I fucked up. Okay?

14:27.616 --> 14:30.202
But I-- I didn't use, I didn't,

14:30.286 --> 14:32.371
and I'm so fucking cold,

14:32.454 --> 14:36.208
and my... my arms and legs are so stiff,
I just...

14:37.835 --> 14:39.545
I need-- I need a bed.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.964
Like a couch.
I'll sleep on the goddamn floor.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.924
Just... please.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.679
Please, please, please
let me come back, please.

14:59.064 --> 14:59.982
Hey.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.156
What do you think?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.951
It's the perfect place to get clean
for a few days.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.289
We're already paid up
and they even have room service, Luke.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.046
You know, everybody's always
given up on me my whole life.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.007
But not you, Luke. Not you.

15:25.883 --> 15:26.926
You saved me.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.261
But I, um, I didn't.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.765
I mean, you...

15:34.141 --> 15:36.518
You took the money and you ran away.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.021
-I never found you.
-No.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.856
No, I came here.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.025
I got us this hotel room.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.486
And I found you at the payphone,
remember?

15:47.154 --> 15:47.988
Right.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.373
Why did you follow me?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.334
You never did tell me the real truth.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.881
I think it's 'cause you're sweet on me.

16:05.965 --> 16:06.924
A little bit.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.095
I have something for us.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.437
One last time, just to get well
before we get clean.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.815
No, I'm 90-days clean.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.274
Ninety-two, actually.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.818
Yeah, but that's not clean.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.656
You can 12-step it
and collect your chips,

16:30.739 --> 16:32.116
but you're never clean,

16:32.199 --> 16:33.450
never really clean,

16:33.867 --> 16:36.495
because one day that needle's
going back in your arm.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.872
You have an appointment with that needle.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.624
You're expected.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.961
No, that's-- No, that's not true.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.504
I know what you're thinking.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.008
You're thinking this is what I did
with your money.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.802
I mean, Steve's money. Let's be real.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.472
You're thinking that I put it in my arm
in some alley

16:55.556 --> 16:56.890
and maybe I died there.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.852
In the puke and the piss.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.770
And the alley rats are

17:02.354 --> 17:03.939
chewing on me right now.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.983
Little yellow teeth...

17:07.276 --> 17:08.861
punching through the jelly...

17:10.988 --> 17:12.865
of my pretty eyes, right?

17:16.702 --> 17:17.786
God, that's good.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.333
Come with me, Luke.

17:25.085 --> 17:25.919
No.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.257
No, I won't.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.010
Baby, you already did.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.604
Oh, Gordon was right.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.234
If you look long enough at the wallpaper,

17:50.402 --> 17:51.945
you can see that little girl.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.116
It's the little girl with the runny-egg

17:56.825 --> 17:57.659
eyes.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.628
Luke! Luke!

18:09.379 --> 18:11.006
But I've tried everything.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.593
-Maybe with the two of us...
-Dad!

18:16.637 --> 18:17.930
-Steve, wait!

18:44.581 --> 18:45.415
Luke.

18:48.919 --> 18:49.753
Dad?

18:55.175 --> 18:56.051
Up here!

19:01.098 --> 19:01.932
Dad.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.517
Up here! Hurry!

19:06.895 --> 19:07.729
Dad!

19:23.453 --> 19:24.329
Dad.

19:25.080 --> 19:25.914
Dad!

19:26.832 --> 19:28.667
Oh, my God. Shirley!

19:42.764 --> 19:43.932
This is for you.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.730
I didn't order that.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.320
Oh, um...

19:59.031 --> 20:01.074
Tell him thanks, but I'm...

20:06.330 --> 20:07.748
Do you want me to pour it out?

20:09.833 --> 20:10.667
Tell you what,

20:10.751 --> 20:14.588
what's the weirdest thing
you guys have on the happy hour menu?

20:14.671 --> 20:16.590
Like, the thing no one ever orders.

20:42.866 --> 20:46.662
So I'm minding my own business over there
and all of a sudden...

20:46.745 --> 20:48.664
I had to repay you for the drink.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.416
So you sent me a plate of, uh...

20:51.500 --> 20:54.294
Boneless Caribbean jerk wings.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.923
Serves me right for not being able
to spot a ring at ten yards.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.133
No way that's ten yards.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.510
I never really thought about it,

21:01.593 --> 21:03.595
but you send someone a drink--

21:03.679 --> 21:06.306
-Without their consent.
-And it's socially acceptable.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.309
-But you send someone an appetizer--
-Without their consent.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.728
And yeah, it's really, really weird.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.315
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to be funny.

21:15.732 --> 21:17.442
It's been a minute, I guess.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.987
Can I sit here while I eat these?

21:20.737 --> 21:22.614
-You don't have to eat them.
-Oh, sure I do.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.825
I will keep it professional. Hand to God.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.369
We can chat, um, embalming technique.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.454
That's what these things are for, right?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.998
No funny stuff.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.709
-Embalming only.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.422
I guess that's the thing about
starting your own home,

21:38.505 --> 21:39.756
they just never tell you.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.801
It's not like buying a house,
not even a little.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.761
I didn't sleep for two years.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.847
And mine was pre-owned, too.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.181
For real?

21:48.390 --> 21:50.142
I didn't hear last call.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.101
Me either.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.814
Well, I guess that's it.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.150
You were true to your word.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.860
I always am.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.778
Very well behaved.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.780
I seldom am.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.408
-Um, on that note--
-Oh, no.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.410
-Don't do it.
-I'm not. I'm just saying,

22:08.493 --> 22:10.412
-since we missed last call--
-You're gonna do it.

22:10.495 --> 22:14.666
I've got all the makings of a mean martini
in my room if you want a nightcap.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.885
I did really good
right up until the end there.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.095
You did. The one-yard line.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.681
-Such a guy.
-I can't help it.

22:29.765 --> 22:33.769
It's taken 60 million years to develop
the carnivorous biped you see before you.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.438
Thank you, anyway.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.816
It was nice to meet you,
and I enjoyed the conversation,

22:39.900 --> 22:41.401
but I'm going to say goodnight.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.172
That's not what you said, though.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.049
You looked at my ring,

23:04.132 --> 23:06.676
and then I said the thing
about the carnivorous biped,

23:06.760 --> 23:07.719
and you said...

23:08.428 --> 23:10.597
Let's see what kind of martini it makes.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.767
We walked out of the bar,
crossed the lobby, into the elevator,

23:13.850 --> 23:15.727
and you had that martini, didn't you?

23:17.145 --> 23:19.272
How old was Jayden then

23:20.232 --> 23:21.775
And Allie was...

23:21.858 --> 23:22.692
Two.

23:22.776 --> 23:23.610
Two.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.988
It had been diapers and bills for years

23:27.072 --> 23:29.699
and you had just bought the business
and it was in the red

23:29.783 --> 23:30.992
and life was...

23:31.076 --> 23:32.828
-Loud.
-It was hungry, too.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.123
The bills were screaming
and the children were screaming

23:36.206 --> 23:39.292
and your husband just...
drifted out of focus, didn't he?

23:39.376 --> 23:42.754
And you were so far away from home
for the first time in so long.

23:42.838 --> 23:43.797
Stop it.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.259
You looked at my wedding ring
right before you answered.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.886
It was gross. You were married
and you were pushy--

23:49.970 --> 23:51.096
Don't lie.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.432
That ring closed the deal.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.392
You went upstairs with me
because of the ring,

23:55.475 --> 23:56.852
because the ring meant...

23:57.519 --> 23:59.688
You had as much to lose as I did.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.648
And that was a calculation,

24:01.857 --> 24:02.983
Mrs. Harris.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.818
You don't know me.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.112
Well, that was the whole point.
Just a fling.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.364
People have them all the time,
but not you.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.992
I mean, the whole thing was so not you.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.871
But God, who would have guessed
how good at it you were.

24:15.954 --> 24:19.291
You got dressed and you flew home
and it was like nothing happened.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.459
You got away with it.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.793
I'm a good wife.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.130
I'm a good... mother.

24:25.964 --> 24:26.965
I'm a good person.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.092
Well, you never did it again.

24:29.634 --> 24:30.469
Never.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.721
But you never told him, did you?

24:33.221 --> 24:34.097
Fuck you.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.933
And even then,
your anger at Theo and Kevin--

24:37.017 --> 24:38.059
Fuck you.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.936
So righteous.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.397
You don't want to look at it, do you?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.233
You did this thing.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.820
You did it and you liked it,
and you just decided not to look at it.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.739
Now, that's you all over.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.659
Shirley never wants to look.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.704
But Shirley has to look.

25:09.549 --> 25:10.800
Is everything all right?

25:12.636 --> 25:15.096
I think she's just a little overwhelmed.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.100
She knows something most people don't.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.521
The instant someone dies,

25:22.854 --> 25:24.356
they learn everything.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.485
Every secret thing.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.571
And when I die,

25:32.364 --> 25:34.366
I'm going to wake up in that hotel room

25:34.449 --> 25:37.285
and have to watch
every single thing she did.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.205
And that scares her so bad,

25:40.830 --> 25:42.499
she hopes she'll die first.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.212
Oh, that's all right.

25:48.755 --> 25:49.589
Here.

25:50.757 --> 25:51.758
Come with me.

25:53.843 --> 25:54.719
It's okay.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.013
I fixed her.

25:58.765 --> 26:01.184
I ripped out her organs and eyeballs,

26:01.268 --> 26:04.229
and I sucked out the blood and the shit,

26:04.312 --> 26:06.439
and plugged her holes
so she wouldn't leak.

26:07.315 --> 26:09.734
And wired her jaw so she couldn't scream.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.863
And I painted her face and her hands,
and...

26:15.323 --> 26:17.784
set her eyelids on spikes
so they wouldn't stare.

26:18.535 --> 26:22.205
And I hung flowers full of smell
and posed her like a dreamer,

26:22.289 --> 26:23.164
and now,

26:23.748 --> 26:26.167
she is fixed and pretty.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.088
But underneath,

26:30.422 --> 26:32.841
she is a horror.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.511
We pickle it and paint it,
but it's still death.

26:37.345 --> 26:38.221
And rot.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.764
And ruin.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.143
But she is pretty.

26:45.478 --> 26:46.396
Isn't she?

27:14.049 --> 27:14.883
Shirley.

27:21.848 --> 27:22.891
What the hell?

27:23.475 --> 27:24.434
We need help.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.019
This isn't real.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.063
-It's a dream.
-It's real.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.106
He's dying.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.151
Come on, Luke!

27:35.987 --> 27:36.821
Come on.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.998
Tell me something
only I will ever know.

27:47.415 --> 27:48.249
uke!

27:48.333 --> 27:49.668
When I was a child...

27:51.544 --> 27:53.505
When I was a child,
my mother spanked me

27:53.588 --> 27:55.965
for throwing a rock
through a greenhouse roof.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.053
It was the only time she ever.

28:01.596 --> 28:04.849
She had designed it, you see, and she was
getting ready to show it to a client,

28:04.933 --> 28:06.810
and because I threw the rock...

28:09.312 --> 28:11.398
for the only time in my life, she hit me.

28:13.149 --> 28:13.983
Just once.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.528
That was all she could take,
and then never again.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.532
But a simple rock through some glass

28:20.615 --> 28:22.659
taught me so much about my mother.

28:24.619 --> 28:25.662
Taught her, too.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.041
I thought about it for a long time,
remembering the spanking.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.837
But remembering also the lovely crash.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.385
And after thinking about it
very seriously,

28:41.761 --> 28:43.179
I went out and did it again.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.150
What's that about?

28:59.779 --> 29:00.613
I...

29:01.197 --> 29:02.073
can't...

29:02.907 --> 29:03.742
recall.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.702
There was a reason for this, and...

29:07.620 --> 29:08.621
I don't remember.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.051
I don't feel anything.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.346
-That's okay, none taken.
-No, I don't...

29:26.473 --> 29:28.558
I don't feel anything else.

29:29.225 --> 29:30.602
Because you're normal.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.355
What were you feeling before?

29:35.273 --> 29:36.524
I was feeling...

29:37.192 --> 29:38.026
fear.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.445
And...

29:41.321 --> 29:42.238
And guilt.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.118
Fear and guilt are sisters.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.707
I knew a man once

29:53.124 --> 29:54.626
who knew those sisters well.

29:55.835 --> 29:58.046
They kissed his eyelids as he slept,

29:58.129 --> 30:01.174
and every morning he went
just a little more mad.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.094
So he built a wall to keep it all outside,

30:05.845 --> 30:07.680
but those two sisters,

30:08.306 --> 30:09.724
they were in there with him.

30:10.767 --> 30:11.726
Even there.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.896
That silly man thought his wall
would keep them out,

30:14.979 --> 30:17.899
but there was just enough room
for him...

30:19.859 --> 30:20.819
and them.

30:24.572 --> 30:26.699
So he was trapped behind that wall.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.577
Afraid and guilty.

30:30.411 --> 30:31.830
And his voice left him

30:31.913 --> 30:34.332
and he scratched and whimpered,

30:34.874 --> 30:37.544
and his fingers were shredded
on his own bricks

30:37.627 --> 30:40.296
until his scratches just sounded like...

30:41.214 --> 30:42.632
rats in a wall.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.846
He felt small.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.224
So small.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.103
But that was his dream.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.565
And when he woke up, he was tall.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.651
So tall.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.655
For always.

31:09.909 --> 31:10.743
Wait.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.080
Fear and guilt are sisters, Theodora.

31:14.914 --> 31:17.166
But when you wake up,
they'll leave you be.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.168
For always.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.088
Wait.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.006
Shh.

31:25.592 --> 31:26.551
Just enjoy me.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.137
I'm loving you.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.601
No.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.227
No, no--

31:36.936 --> 31:37.770
No.

31:37.854 --> 31:38.688
Theo.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.079
He's not breathing.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.000
Oh, my God.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.376
Stop, stop, stop.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.212
Come on.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.092
-Go, go.
-Check his pulse.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.136
No, no. No, no, no.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.555
I-- I can't feel it.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.307
Don't you fucking dare, Luke!

32:14.390 --> 32:16.184
-Don't you fucking dare!
-Oh, shit.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.239
Sweetheart.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.242
You're awake.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.453
Oh, I've missed you so, so much.

33:24.544 --> 33:25.670
Where are we?

33:26.337 --> 33:28.089
We're home, my love.

33:29.882 --> 33:30.883
You know,

33:31.217 --> 33:33.386
when I was a little girl about your age,

33:34.137 --> 33:36.472
I was driving in the car
with your grandmother,

33:37.640 --> 33:43.187
and we passed a house adorned
with a forest of red roses.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.190
And I fell in love with that house,

33:46.858 --> 33:49.485
and with houses, all at once.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.280
I can live there forever, I thought.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.116
No one will ever find me there, either.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.952
I will light a fire in the cool evenings

33:58.036 --> 34:01.039
and toast apples in my own hearth.

34:02.123 --> 34:05.084
People will come to me to have
their fortunes told,

34:05.710 --> 34:08.713
and I will brew love potions
for sad maidens.

34:09.672 --> 34:10.631
I will have a...

34:11.966 --> 34:12.884
a robin.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.303
I will have a robin.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.515
I almost named you Robin.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.935
Your dad even agreed.

34:23.436 --> 34:24.854
Robin Crain.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.317
But when I looked at you
for the first time...

34:30.985 --> 34:32.445
you were Luke.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.238
You just were.

34:35.907 --> 34:36.741
Oh.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.327
I almost forgot.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.503
Your big boy hat.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.381
No, I, um...

34:53.174 --> 34:54.092
No, no.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.636
We were going to have a tea party,

34:56.719 --> 35:00.139
with big boy hats
and cups of stars and we're...

35:01.140 --> 35:03.601
we're so glad you're finally here.

35:03.893 --> 35:04.727
Go.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.232
Why would you want your brother to go?

35:09.315 --> 35:10.691
He just got here.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.027
Have a seat.

35:13.486 --> 35:14.403
Don't.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.405
Am I dead?

35:19.659 --> 35:20.785
You're awake.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.787
And I'm so sorry, honey.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.331
You were having such a nightmare.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.709
I'm-- I'm sorry, Mom.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.420
No, don't you apologize to me.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.966
It wasn't your fault, never once.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.426
You were perfect.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.303
But I-- I wasn't.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.639
-I'm-- I'm not.
-You were.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.057
And you are.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.725
It's the world, my love.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.727
It isn't and it wasn't and you never

35:46.811 --> 35:48.813
should have been fed to it
like you were.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.026
Yes, have a seat.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.153
Don't.

35:56.654 --> 35:57.488
Go.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.407
Why-- Why does she keep saying that?

35:59.490 --> 36:00.992
Honey. Honey...

36:01.576 --> 36:03.744
Just look at me. Look at me.

36:05.037 --> 36:06.205
This is a gift.

36:06.747 --> 36:07.790
For us all.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.709
Not if I'm dead. I--

36:10.126 --> 36:11.294
I don't want to be dead.

36:11.377 --> 36:12.879
But you want to be in here.

36:12.962 --> 36:15.006
-No, I-- I don't.
-Yeah, you do.

36:16.048 --> 36:18.593
You've been knocking on that door

36:19.302 --> 36:21.387
for years and years and years.

36:21.470 --> 36:22.680
We could hear you.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.099
Knocking louder all the time.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.809
And finally, here you are.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.020
-Please.
-Don't.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.147
No, I have to get-- I have to get...

36:31.689 --> 36:32.607
Please!

36:38.779 --> 36:39.739
Oh, God.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.117
Luke! Hey, can you hear me?

36:43.201 --> 36:45.828
-His pulse is pretty weak.
-We got to get him to a hospital.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.206
I thought you were gone, man.
I thought you were gone.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.332
She saved me.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.752
You-- You just woke up.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.295
-No.
-You were gone.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.547
She saved me.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.095
I feel a little clearer just now.

37:06.015 --> 37:06.891
We have.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.560
-Nell?
-All of us have.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.189
Wouldn't have changed anything.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.191
I need you to know that.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.277
-Nell--
-The rest is confetti.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.237
Hey.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.155
So many times and we didn't know it.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.532
All of us.

37:23.824 --> 37:24.700
Nellie?

37:24.992 --> 37:27.453
No, not a heart.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.247
-Nell?
-A stomach.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.123
Nell?

37:31.540 --> 37:32.375
We have.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.293
All of us have.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.087
I don't think she can hear us.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.173
So many times and we didn't know it.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.219
All right, we need to get
Luke out of here,

37:43.302 --> 37:45.012
we need to get him to a hospital--

37:46.305 --> 37:47.682
I don't get it.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.059
All this time we tried to get
into this room

37:50.142 --> 37:51.936
and now we can't get the fuck out.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.355
I feel like I've been here before.

37:54.814 --> 37:55.731
We have.

37:57.984 --> 37:58.943
All of us have.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.697
So many times and we didn't know it.

38:04.573 --> 38:05.449
All of us.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.122
I feel a bit clearer now.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.709
Everything's been out of order.

38:15.334 --> 38:16.168
Time, I mean.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.339
I thought for so long that time

38:20.923 --> 38:22.800
was like a line, that...

38:24.260 --> 38:26.470
that our moments were laid out
like dominoes,

38:26.554 --> 38:27.596
and that they...

38:28.723 --> 38:31.350
fell, one into another

38:31.434 --> 38:32.810
and on it went,

38:32.893 --> 38:36.439
just days tipping, one into the next,
into the next,

38:36.981 --> 38:39.275
in a long line between the beginning...

38:41.610 --> 38:42.486
and the end.

38:44.739 --> 38:45.573
But I was wrong.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.493
It's not like that at all.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.914
Our moments fall around us like rain.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.626
Or... snow.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.505
Or confetti.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.302
You were right.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.846
We have been in this room.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.640
So many times and we didn't know.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.018
All of us.

39:16.729 --> 39:17.813
Mom says...

39:20.649 --> 39:23.069
that a house is like a body...

39:24.403 --> 39:25.654
and that every house...

39:27.448 --> 39:28.574
has eyes.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.494
And bones.

39:32.953 --> 39:33.996
And skin.

39:37.291 --> 39:38.417
And a face.

39:44.423 --> 39:46.634
This room is like the heart of the house.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.055
No, not a heart, a stomach.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.145
It was your dance studio, Theo.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.149
It was my toy room.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.569
It was a reading room for Mom.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.739
A game room for Steve.

40:09.156 --> 40:10.991
A family room for Shirley.

40:11.617 --> 40:12.493
A treehouse.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.787
How do you spell "No Girls Allowed"?

40:15.538 --> 40:17.706
But it was always the Red Room.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.375
How do you take your tea?

40:19.458 --> 40:23.462
It put on different faces
so that we'd be still and quiet.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.924
While it digested.

40:29.718 --> 40:33.097
I'm like a small creature
swallowed whole by a monster.

40:34.223 --> 40:37.643
And the monster feels my tiny little
movements inside.

40:46.902 --> 40:48.237
You have to live.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.827
I don't-- I don't know how to do this
without you.

40:54.994 --> 40:56.412
I learned a secret.

40:58.205 --> 40:59.498
There's no without.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.126
I am not gone.

41:04.336 --> 41:07.339
I'm scattered into so many pieces,

41:08.257 --> 41:10.259
sprinkled on your life like

41:11.135 --> 41:12.303
new snow.

41:15.931 --> 41:18.184
There's so much
I want to say to you all.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.729
I'm so sorry our last words were in anger.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.481
They weren't our last.

41:25.357 --> 41:26.484
I'm sorry.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.611
I'm sorry that I didn't...

41:29.778 --> 41:30.779
answer the phone.

41:31.822 --> 41:32.740
But you did.

41:34.116 --> 41:35.451
So many times.

41:36.952 --> 41:39.747
I'm sorry if I didn't listen,
and I'm sorry--

41:39.830 --> 41:41.624
It wouldn't have changed anything.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.584
I need you to know that.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.671
Forgiveness is warm.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.341
Like a tear on a cheek.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.053
Think of that and of me

41:54.929 --> 41:56.472
when you stand in the rain.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.893
I loved you completely.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.563
And you loved me the same.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.273
That's all.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.069
The rest is confetti.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.584
The first was young Miss Grattan

43:07.042 --> 43:08.711
She tried not to let him in

43:09.336 --> 43:11.213
He stabbed her with a corn knife

43:11.755 --> 43:13.340
That's how his crimes begin

43:13.882 --> 43:15.634
The next was Grandma Grattan

43:15.926 --> 43:17.970
So old and tired and gray

43:18.554 --> 43:20.180
She f'it off her attacker

43:21.140 --> 43:22.850
Until his strength gave way

43:23.517 --> 43:25.477
The next was Grandpa Grattan

43:26.061 --> 43:27.730
A-settin' by the fire

43:28.230 --> 43:30.399
He came up close behind him

43:31.233 --> 43:33.485
And strangled him with wire

43:34.903 --> 43:36.864
The last was Baby Grattan

43:37.239 --> 43:38.866
All in his trundle bed

43:39.450 --> 43:41.785
He stove him in the short ribs

43:41.952 --> 43:43.912
Until that child was dead

43:44.455 --> 43:46.457
And then he spit tobacco juice

43:47.082 --> 43:49.668
All on his golden head

43:49.918 --> 43:51.003
Stay away.

44:02.056 --> 44:04.183
He's just too cute, Liv.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.018
Away.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.896
Forgive a girl for being lonely.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.400
Nothing sadder than a cold bed.

44:14.234 --> 44:16.987
But all those wedding beds go cold.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.076
Don't they, loves?

44:36.924 --> 44:40.761
Journeys end in lovers' meeting.

44:45.599 --> 44:48.519
I have spent an all but sleepless night.

44:50.020 --> 44:53.190
I have told lies
and made a fool of myself.

44:54.191 --> 44:57.111
And the very air tastes like wine.

44:58.987 --> 45:00.614
Everyone is home.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.992
You've changed so much.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.252
For my heart.

45:14.128 --> 45:16.213
How long has it been since you were here?

45:16.296 --> 45:18.090
Longer than I intended.

45:18.674 --> 45:21.719
It was too hard to see you here,
this way.

45:22.052 --> 45:24.054
But I still...

45:25.848 --> 45:27.850
-had you with me.
-Oh, love.

45:28.434 --> 45:29.435
That wasn't me,

45:29.518 --> 45:30.894
that was just you.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.564
What were you doing...

45:34.398 --> 45:35.649
all this time away?

45:40.320 --> 45:41.155
I was...

45:42.281 --> 45:43.574
holding a door.

45:47.828 --> 45:50.539
Holding a door closed.

45:52.332 --> 45:55.169
I had my back against it

45:55.544 --> 45:58.005
and my arms out wide,

45:58.088 --> 46:00.340
because I knew there were monsters
in the other side

46:00.424 --> 46:02.259
and they wanted what was left
of our family.

46:02.342 --> 46:04.803
And I held it so hard,

46:04.887 --> 46:08.265
I didn't have arms left for the kids.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.434
The monsters got through anyway.

46:10.517 --> 46:12.102
That's what monsters do.

46:13.228 --> 46:14.730
-But not here.
-No.

46:14.813 --> 46:16.190
Especially here.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.901
They're-- They're out there,

46:18.984 --> 46:20.319
in the woods.

46:20.402 --> 46:24.156
They're out there and we're in here
and the children are finally safe.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.074
But, no. No.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.577
They're-- They're not.

46:29.536 --> 46:30.579
They're dying.

46:30.704 --> 46:31.705
They're waking.

46:33.332 --> 46:34.917
You kept them from me.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.127
To keep them safe.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.588
You kept them from the truth.

46:40.631 --> 46:41.840
To keep you safe.

46:42.424 --> 46:44.176
Their-- Their image of you.

46:47.179 --> 46:48.180
I woke up...

46:49.515 --> 46:51.058
at the foot of these stairs,

46:52.226 --> 46:53.727
and I started walking.

46:55.521 --> 46:56.688
No more headaches.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.316
No pain, no day, no night,

46:59.399 --> 47:00.734
no now, no then.

47:02.277 --> 47:04.488
And I would dream while I walked.

47:06.365 --> 47:07.491
I dreamed of you.

47:07.908 --> 47:10.369
I dreamed of you
and the children's laughter.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.246
And then I'd remember...

47:13.455 --> 47:15.249
that you took them from me.

47:15.749 --> 47:16.834
You took them

47:17.334 --> 47:19.294
and you hurt them, Hugh.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.797
-And they suffered.
-They did.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.257
They all do.

47:24.591 --> 47:27.094
And even if they're broken or addicted

47:27.177 --> 47:29.805
or joyless or, yes, even if they die,

47:30.180 --> 47:32.474
we have to watch it all
because we're parents.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.811
And that's the deal we make.

47:36.186 --> 47:38.772
Whatever that life is,
we bear witness.

47:38.897 --> 47:40.941
-It's a horror.
-It doesn't have to be.

47:41.441 --> 47:44.194
I saw our daughter dance at her wedding.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.446
Her smile was like a light

47:46.530 --> 47:48.615
and it was reflected in everyone's faces,

47:48.699 --> 47:50.492
and I recognized that light.

47:51.535 --> 47:53.871
Because it was ours. We did that.

47:53.996 --> 47:56.123
We loved each other so well

47:56.206 --> 47:58.625
that it spread out into the universe

47:58.709 --> 48:01.503
and it created a new star.

48:04.172 --> 48:05.674
Stars die.

48:06.842 --> 48:09.177
The night sky is full of dead stars.

48:09.803 --> 48:11.680
They explode to death.

48:11.930 --> 48:14.641
And if you could reach up
with some great hand

48:14.725 --> 48:15.934
and pull them down

48:16.018 --> 48:17.769
just before they burst,

48:18.061 --> 48:18.937
you would.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.022
Yes, I would.

48:20.105 --> 48:21.231
We're all safe now.

48:22.316 --> 48:25.444
This is our forever house.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.029
It always was.

48:27.321 --> 48:30.407
Nothing bad will ever touch them
ever again.

48:30.490 --> 48:32.075
Nothing good will, either.

48:34.161 --> 48:35.329
Open that door.

48:35.746 --> 48:37.581
I know you can open that door.

48:38.582 --> 48:40.709
I know you love the people in that room

48:41.126 --> 48:42.252
more than anything.

48:42.336 --> 48:44.296
I won't let you take them away again.

48:45.255 --> 48:46.214
They'll die.

48:46.298 --> 48:48.508
Liv, they will die if they stay.
They're dying now.

48:48.592 --> 48:49.885
Our babies are dying.

48:51.511 --> 48:52.387
Let them go.

48:52.846 --> 48:55.515
You have always said that our job
was to send them sailing.

48:55.599 --> 48:57.142
-That was a dream.
-Out into the world.

48:57.225 --> 48:58.810
-A dream.
-Into the world.

48:59.436 --> 49:00.312
Let them go.

49:00.395 --> 49:01.772
I'll be alone again!

49:07.527 --> 49:09.780
If it wasn't for the kids in that room,

49:09.863 --> 49:10.864
I would've

49:11.490 --> 49:12.449
laid down with you.

49:12.866 --> 49:14.284
I would have followed you...

49:16.411 --> 49:18.038
right into the darkness.

49:19.498 --> 49:20.832
But those kids, Liv...

49:24.336 --> 49:26.713
but those kids in that room,

49:28.131 --> 49:30.717
if you open that door right now...

49:32.678 --> 49:36.306
I will make a promise to you
that I will keep forever.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.059
Open the door.

49:40.644 --> 49:41.478
Please.

49:41.853 --> 49:43.105
Let me fix this.

49:48.318 --> 49:49.277
Journeys end...

49:50.237 --> 49:51.571
In lovers' meeting.

49:55.200 --> 49:58.412
You had that engraved on my watch,

49:58.495 --> 49:59.496
do you remember?

49:59.788 --> 50:00.998
But I was wrong.

50:02.165 --> 50:03.625
That's the secret, isn't it?

50:05.127 --> 50:06.461
Journeys don't end.

50:07.796 --> 50:09.089
Not if you love someone.

50:09.673 --> 50:10.799
They don't end at all.

50:12.509 --> 50:13.969
Isn't that wonderful?

50:16.930 --> 50:18.265
Once upon a time,

50:19.141 --> 50:21.727
the world was just play.

50:23.603 --> 50:24.646
And all...

50:25.605 --> 50:27.065
All we had...

50:28.191 --> 50:30.402
-The five of us--
-No, no, no, stay with me.

50:30.485 --> 50:33.155
All we had was... play.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.365
Luke. Luke. Luke.

50:35.449 --> 50:37.576
Stay with me. Stay awake! Stay--

50:45.500 --> 50:46.626
I'll start the car.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.462
-Is he breathing?
-Yeah.

50:49.129 --> 50:50.005
Come on.

51:04.686 --> 51:06.897
-Sacred Heart's closest.
-I can navigate.

51:06.980 --> 51:08.523
Are you guys coming with us or--?

51:08.607 --> 51:09.566
Go ahead.

51:10.108 --> 51:12.360
There's one more thing
your brother and I have to do.

51:12.444 --> 51:13.862
-We'll see you there.
-What?

51:13.945 --> 51:15.322
We'll meet you at the hospital.

51:36.927 --> 51:39.221
Probably best you didn't
say anything to them.

51:43.350 --> 51:44.184
Dad.

51:45.644 --> 51:46.603
What did I see?

52:25.392 --> 52:26.351
Olivia?

52:30.814 --> 52:31.648
Liv?

53:16.234 --> 53:17.444
What happened?

53:20.655 --> 53:21.615
Why are you here?

53:21.740 --> 53:22.824
Did you see?

53:24.534 --> 53:25.619
What happened?

53:26.161 --> 53:26.995
I-- I--

53:28.747 --> 53:29.873
I don't know.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.001
We were looking for...

53:43.220 --> 53:44.429
Oh, my God.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.348
I can fix this.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.143
I can fix it.

53:58.151 --> 53:58.985
Hugh.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.195
I can fix it.

54:01.112 --> 54:02.030
Put her down.

54:02.656 --> 54:04.449
No, I can fix this.

54:05.533 --> 54:06.701
You-- You can't.

54:15.418 --> 54:16.753
Why is this happening?

54:19.089 --> 54:20.715
Why are you even here?

54:20.799 --> 54:23.843
We need to get you help.
We need to get the police.

54:23.927 --> 54:25.178
Why are you here?

54:26.221 --> 54:30.392
Our daughter snuck out of a vent tonight
and we thought maybe...

54:38.108 --> 54:39.109
No.

54:39.192 --> 54:40.151
No.

54:40.360 --> 54:41.987
No, no, no...

54:42.070 --> 54:45.532
No. No. Oh, no.

54:46.992 --> 54:48.159
No...

54:48.952 --> 54:50.287
Both of their children.

54:51.288 --> 54:52.539
All of their children.

54:56.626 --> 54:58.169
She wasn't in her bed.

55:00.171 --> 55:01.214
I didn't know.

55:02.590 --> 55:03.633
I didn't know.

55:04.009 --> 55:04.926
Mommy?

55:12.976 --> 55:13.893
Abby?

55:15.520 --> 55:16.354
Abby?

55:21.026 --> 55:22.694
Abby. Abby.

55:23.361 --> 55:24.362
What happened?

55:24.946 --> 55:26.239
Who hurt you, baby girl?

55:44.382 --> 55:45.258
Honey?

55:48.136 --> 55:50.388
I'm having the strangest dream.

56:07.947 --> 56:09.407
I'm gonna burn it.

56:13.411 --> 56:15.455
I'm gonna burn this house to the ground.

56:19.793 --> 56:20.877
Stand over it.

56:22.337 --> 56:26.174
Make sure that every room, every wall,
every splinter is immolated.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.969
Burn this house and its hills to the dirt.

56:32.138 --> 56:33.431
Then I'll salt the earth.

56:35.141 --> 56:36.059
You won't.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.521
Horace, he can't.

56:41.689 --> 56:42.982
She's still here.

56:48.154 --> 56:50.907
I'll... carry her body back to the woods.

56:50.990 --> 56:51.825
I'll...

56:53.034 --> 56:55.745
bury her by the cottage in the garden
that she loved.

56:59.416 --> 57:00.458
And when she's buried

57:01.543 --> 57:03.962
and it's done, we'll say nothing.

57:05.672 --> 57:06.840
You understand, Hugh?

57:07.674 --> 57:08.508
We'll say nothing.

57:09.843 --> 57:12.262
She barely left our house her whole life.

57:13.138 --> 57:15.515
We kept her out of the world
to keep her safe.

57:17.517 --> 57:20.186
And we're the only ones
who would even know to...

57:21.688 --> 57:22.772
to mourn her.

57:26.317 --> 57:28.361
We won't say anything about Olivia.

57:30.655 --> 57:31.698
We won't.

57:34.701 --> 57:35.785
That wasn't her.

57:36.369 --> 57:37.203
We know that.

57:37.454 --> 57:38.705
No, we know

57:39.414 --> 57:41.291
what really happened here tonight.

57:42.459 --> 57:43.585
And your kids,

57:44.544 --> 57:47.046
they don't need to hear anything else.

57:47.630 --> 57:50.633
Or remember their mother in any way

57:50.717 --> 57:52.510
but the way that you truly was.

57:54.721 --> 57:56.473
And we can protect that for you.

57:58.892 --> 57:59.726
If...

58:02.020 --> 58:02.896
If what?

58:04.606 --> 58:06.274
If you keep this house.

58:06.858 --> 58:07.817
Keep us on.

58:09.444 --> 58:10.904
Keep everyone else away.

58:11.821 --> 58:14.699
Don't let it take anyone else,
never again.

58:15.366 --> 58:16.409
Let it starve.

58:18.786 --> 58:19.996
But leave it here.

58:22.040 --> 58:23.249
So I can see her.

58:25.668 --> 58:26.544
This house,

58:27.295 --> 58:30.882
it's full of precious, precious things,

58:31.549 --> 58:33.426
and they don't all belong to you.

58:34.886 --> 58:36.137
It's dangerous.

58:38.431 --> 58:39.349
For both of you.

58:39.432 --> 58:41.684
I don't care.
This is where she is now.

58:42.727 --> 58:43.853
I'm her mother.

58:44.145 --> 58:45.772
I won't leave her here alone.

58:48.149 --> 58:49.442
I will not.

58:52.737 --> 58:53.655
Please, Hugh.

59:00.453 --> 59:01.329
Please.

59:52.130 --> 59:53.798
I wish you would have told me.

59:57.844 --> 1:00:00.013
You didn't tell your sisters what you saw.

1:00:00.847 --> 1:00:01.681
Why not?

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:05.101
Some things

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:06.686
can't be told.

1:00:07.812 --> 1:00:08.896
You live them...

1:00:09.814 --> 1:00:10.773
or you don't.

1:00:11.441 --> 1:00:12.900
But they can't be told.

1:00:15.945 --> 1:00:16.863
I'm sorry.

1:00:17.864 --> 1:00:18.781
No.

1:00:20.825 --> 1:00:21.909
I'm sorry, Dad.

1:00:23.911 --> 1:00:25.246
This is all yours now.

1:00:28.374 --> 1:00:29.334
The house.

1:00:31.419 --> 1:00:32.378
And the promise.

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:37.634
I want you to know.

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:39.469
You...

1:00:40.219 --> 1:00:41.512
and your sisters...

1:00:42.347 --> 1:00:43.348
and your brother...

1:00:44.932 --> 1:00:46.559
were the best part of my...

1:00:47.644 --> 1:00:48.478
my...

1:00:52.815 --> 1:00:54.442
Never been prouder of anything.

1:00:56.694 --> 1:00:58.279
Anything, ever.

1:01:03.826 --> 1:01:05.036
Take care of each other.

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:08.873
-Dad?
-And be kind to each other.

1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:12.293
If nothing else...

1:01:13.670 --> 1:01:14.545
be kind.

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:18.966
I was so lucky...

1:01:19.842 --> 1:01:20.927
to be your dad.

1:02:50.057 --> 1:02:51.058
Home.

1:02:54.228 --> 1:02:55.688
"I am home," I thought...

1:02:57.356 --> 1:02:59.317
and stopped in wonder at the thought.

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:02.236
I am home.

1:03:03.488 --> 1:03:04.697
I am home.

1:03:06.616 --> 1:03:07.575
Now to climb.

1:03:11.746 --> 1:03:13.289
I've been so wrong

1:03:13.831 --> 1:03:15.124
about so much.

1:03:18.377 --> 1:03:20.922
I've lived with ghosts since I was a kid.

1:03:22.673 --> 1:03:24.967
Since before I knew they were even there.

1:03:25.927 --> 1:03:28.638
Ghosts are guilt, ghosts are secrets,

1:03:28.721 --> 1:03:30.890
ghosts are regrets and failings.

1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:35.102
But most times...

1:03:36.938 --> 1:03:39.023
most times a ghost is a wish.

1:03:43.110 --> 1:03:45.279
Like a marriage is a wish.

1:03:49.659 --> 1:03:53.371
A marriage can be like a house
and a marriage can be haunted,

1:03:53.454 --> 1:03:54.997
and I let that happen to us.

1:03:55.122 --> 1:03:57.291
And I'm so sorry, Leigh.

1:03:57.834 --> 1:03:58.793
You're scaring me.

1:04:00.795 --> 1:04:02.713
I have something
that I have to tell you.

1:04:05.216 --> 1:04:06.425
And I'm going to.

1:04:07.635 --> 1:04:11.138
But I need you to remember while I do,
that I love you,

1:04:12.139 --> 1:04:12.974
my sweet...

1:04:13.766 --> 1:04:14.600
friend.

1:04:15.935 --> 1:04:16.978
My best friend.

1:04:18.354 --> 1:04:20.898
I'm asking you to love me

1:04:22.275 --> 1:04:24.569
hard for the next few minutes,

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:26.404
and it might be the hardest

1:04:27.196 --> 1:04:28.656
that you've ever had to love me,

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:30.616
but I know it'll be okay,

1:04:30.950 --> 1:04:32.034
because it's us.

1:04:33.411 --> 1:04:34.245
So...

1:04:35.746 --> 1:04:39.125
I'm going to jump
and I'm asking you to hold my hand...

1:04:40.626 --> 1:04:41.711
while I'm falling.

1:04:45.756 --> 1:04:46.716
Okay?

1:04:51.012 --> 1:04:51.846
Okay.

1:04:58.811 --> 1:04:59.729
Years ago...

1:05:01.147 --> 1:05:03.107
six years ago...

1:05:04.275 --> 1:05:06.527
I went to that conference in Chicago.

1:05:08.237 --> 1:05:09.280
I wish...

1:05:10.364 --> 1:05:11.741
I'd loved you better.

1:05:13.367 --> 1:05:15.995
And let you see me clearly
without disguise.

1:05:17.121 --> 1:05:18.873
I wish I'd been a better husband.

1:05:20.833 --> 1:05:22.543
I wish I'd been a better son.

1:05:23.961 --> 1:05:25.755
I wish I'd been a better brother.

1:05:27.256 --> 1:05:28.674
What are you saying, Steve?

1:05:30.343 --> 1:05:32.929
I'm saying I built a wall
around a big part of my life

1:05:33.012 --> 1:05:34.680
and I hid behind that wall

1:05:34.764 --> 1:05:38.851
and I thought that wall kept us both safe,
but walls don't work that way.

1:05:39.518 --> 1:05:41.854
Walls never work that way.

1:05:41.938 --> 1:05:43.064
What about these?

1:05:43.856 --> 1:05:44.815
Oh, trash.

1:06:06.337 --> 1:06:08.547
I think the truck's full.
Is that everything?

1:06:08.923 --> 1:06:10.007
Yeah, I'm ready.

1:06:19.308 --> 1:06:20.518
And all of that,

1:06:20.810 --> 1:06:22.478
the guilt and the grief

1:06:22.561 --> 1:06:25.147
and the secrets and the walls
and the ghosts,

1:06:25.231 --> 1:06:26.148
right now

1:06:26.941 --> 1:06:28.317
my only wish...

1:06:31.529 --> 1:06:33.906
my only wish is to come home.

1:06:37.410 --> 1:06:38.369
Please.

1:06:44.959 --> 1:06:46.544
I just want to fix this.

1:06:59.265 --> 1:07:00.099
Fear.

1:07:02.727 --> 1:07:05.479
Fear is the relinquishment of logic,

1:07:05.563 --> 1:07:08.607
the willing relinquishing
of reasonable patterns.

1:07:14.363 --> 1:07:15.406
We're here.

1:07:17.033 --> 1:07:18.159
We're here,

1:07:18.784 --> 1:07:19.910
Clara.

1:07:21.537 --> 1:07:22.538
We made it.

1:07:29.336 --> 1:07:31.881
But so, it seems, is love.

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:51.942
Love is the relinquishment
of logic...

1:07:54.695 --> 1:07:57.573
...the willing relinquishing
of reasonable patterns.

1:08:00.534 --> 1:08:02.912
We yield to it or we fight it.

1:08:03.996 --> 1:08:05.623
But we cannot meet it halfway.

1:08:09.168 --> 1:08:10.127
Without it,

1:08:10.628 --> 1:08:13.172
we cannot continue for long
to exist sanely

1:08:13.255 --> 1:08:16.008
under conditions of absolute reality.

1:08:18.302 --> 1:08:19.303
Hill House,

1:08:19.804 --> 1:08:20.763
not sane,

1:08:21.388 --> 1:08:24.183
stands against its hills
holding darkness within.

1:08:26.227 --> 1:08:28.229
It has stood so for a hundred years

1:08:28.312 --> 1:08:30.064
and might stand a hundred more.

1:08:36.153 --> 1:08:36.987
Within...

1:08:37.863 --> 1:08:39.573
walls continue upright...

1:08:40.783 --> 1:08:42.076
bricks meet neatly...

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:44.370
floors are firm...

1:08:46.372 --> 1:08:48.124
and doors are sensibly shut.

1:08:51.877 --> 1:08:53.295
Silence lay steadily

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:56.423
against the wood and stone of Hill House.

1:09:01.887 --> 1:09:03.430
And those who walk there...

1:09:06.100 --> 1:09:07.059
walk together.
