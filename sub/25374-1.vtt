01:42.185 --> 01:43.596
Thanks. Have a good class.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.726
Okay, someone has to address
this towel situation.

01:46.815 --> 01:50.434
'Cause, like, I labeled the bins
specifically for certain towels.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.859
Hi. Renee Bennett.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.696
- Oh.
- Uh, Renee Bennett.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.738
Is this not where I go?

01:56.825 --> 01:58.361
No, this is where you go.
Just sign in here.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.442
- Okay.
- Do you need shoes?

01:59.745 --> 02:01.281
- Yes.
- Okay, what size?

02:01.371 --> 02:02.282
Eight.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.613
- Eight?
- Seven.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.284
- Seven. Okay.
- Nine. And a half.

02:08.002 --> 02:08.959
Nine and a half?

02:09.045 --> 02:10.162
- Nine...
- Okay. Yeah.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.586
Double-wide?

02:12.007 --> 02:13.123
Double what?

02:14.635 --> 02:15.625
Double-wide.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.009
Like the trailer?

02:17.095 --> 02:19.462
- Um...
- Double-wide. Just...

02:20.432 --> 02:22.094
Do we have a double-wide shoe?

02:22.476 --> 02:25.014
It's just like a regular shoe,
but it's wider,

02:25.103 --> 02:26.560
and then it's wider for that.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.388
I guess for just wider feet.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.144
You know what?
I think we have a male instructor

02:30.233 --> 02:31.565
who used to be, like, a fireman.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.518
- Maybe he matches your big foot?
- It's... It's not...

02:34.321 --> 02:35.528
I'm just going to take these.
These are perfect.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.480
Okay. Have a good class.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.157
So, your first time?

02:47.626 --> 02:48.742
Mmm-hmm.

02:48.835 --> 02:49.996
Me too.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.462
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.587
We all got to start somewhere, right?

02:58.595 --> 02:59.585
Yeah.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.018
- All right, well, good luck.
- Yeah.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.686
- See you in there.
- See you.

03:16.780 --> 03:17.611
Sorry.

03:17.948 --> 03:18.779
What's up?

03:19.950 --> 03:20.781
Sorry.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.925
Oh, shit, are you okay?

03:44.015 --> 03:45.722
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.383
Yeah.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.720
No, seriously, are... are you okay?
'Cause that looks bad.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.022
Yeah, no, I'm just going
to get some smaller shoes.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.896
- Are you okay?
- Um... yeah.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.983
<i>Hey, guys, this is Jen,
and today I wanted to share</i>

04:41.072 --> 04:43.109
<i>another really cool
hair tutorial with you.</i>

04:43.200 --> 04:47.194
<i>This look is a very punk rock
faux hawk using ponytails.</i>

04:47.287 --> 04:48.573
<i>I'm going to start at the top</i>

04:48.663 --> 04:50.575
<i>and add a bump to the top of my head.</i>

04:50.665 --> 04:52.406
<i>Back comb with some hair spray</i>

04:52.501 --> 04:54.163
<i>until you have a lot of volume there.</i>

04:54.252 --> 04:57.086
<i>Now I'm taking another little section
a little bit wider.</i>

04:57.506 --> 04:59.463
<i>Now tie this part back.</i>

04:59.758 --> 05:01.841
<i>Now the very end of your ponytail</i>

05:01.927 --> 05:04.294
<i>you might have this little bit
of hair at the end.</i>

05:04.387 --> 05:06.470
<i>So I'm just going to give it
a lot of volume.</i>

05:06.807 --> 05:08.093
<i>So, this is the final look.</i>

05:08.183 --> 05:10.971
<i>I hope you guys enjoyed this rock star,</i>

05:11.061 --> 05:14.554
<i>kind of punk rock mohawk faux hawk.</i>

05:14.648 --> 05:17.015
<i>If you did, don't forget
to give this video a thumbs up</i>

05:17.108 --> 05:19.976
<i>and subscribe to this channel
if you need more hair tutorials.</i>

05:20.070 --> 05:22.232
<i>This is Jen, and I will
talk to you guys next time.</i>

05:29.162 --> 05:30.243
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.787
Are you shopping for a gift?

05:31.873 --> 05:34.581
Oh, no, just kind of browsing for me.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.254
Okay. Um, so sizing
is a little limited here in the store,

05:39.339 --> 05:41.752
but you could probably
find your size online.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.524
A guy ran by. It was weird.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.027
- I'm trying.
- Just, like, ask.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.279
Get in there.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.311
Mason?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.806
Should we have more, like, banter?

08:06.820 --> 08:07.776
Nah, I'm good.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.146
We should have fun in here.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.280
We should come in
and be, like, excited to interact.

08:17.706 --> 08:18.947
I had sex last night.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.281
Uh... Oh, cool.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.662
I was alone.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.289
Forget it.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.542
Did you get that email from Corporate?

08:28.258 --> 08:30.090
Complaints about the Clafoutis lipstick?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.417
The Clafoutis?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.424
Customers are saying it's way more orange
than it looks online.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.506
No. Okay, then tell me
this isn't the exact same color.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.174
Look at this.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.186
Look.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.808
I just write code.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.560
Come on, Mason.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.188
This is exactly why they should just
let us run the website

08:48.278 --> 08:50.235
from the 5th Avenue headquarters.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.520
Right?

08:51.906 --> 08:52.942
God!

08:53.033 --> 08:56.947
Why does Lily LeClaire, like, hide us
in this weird Chinatown basement?

08:57.203 --> 08:59.741
I'm so sick of it.
Aren't you sick of this?

09:00.665 --> 09:01.576
No.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.532
I'm getting out of here.
I'm getting a coffee.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.289
A real coffee. Not that crap.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.369
Do... Do you want anything?

09:07.464 --> 09:09.626
- Baguetti.
- You mean a baguette?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.708
- Yeah.
- You want a whole baguette?

09:11.801 --> 09:12.712
Half.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.051
Half a baguette. That's not weird.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.975
- Yeah?
- Yeah, the highlighter does it.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.766
- Viv, you look gorgeous.
- Really?

09:24.856 --> 09:26.688
- Right?
- You look really beautiful.

09:26.775 --> 09:27.765
Ooh.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.480
Wow. I mean, I do look pretty.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.812
Just... I don't know if I look like me.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.192
No, you don't look like yourself.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.319
But you do look like Selena Gomez

09:36.409 --> 09:38.617
in that video
where she says, "It ain't me."

09:38.995 --> 09:40.987
It is you. Like, I recreated it.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.916
Are you sure I don't look like
sort of, like, a lady of the night?

09:45.001 --> 09:45.991
Like a prostitute?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.497
"Come over here, boys."

09:47.587 --> 09:49.670
No, and they don't talk like that anymore.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.666
It's, like, kind of rad that your work
lets you take all this stuff.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.671
- I know.
- Well, it's more like implied...

09:54.761 --> 09:56.502
You know, they're not like,
"Here's a gift bag."

09:56.596 --> 09:58.883
But I steal it.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.306
No, but a lot of it's recalled.
They wouldn't care.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.008
Like, this one they said
looks like contraception.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.594
Oh, hey, it really does.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.394
That's exactly
what my pill pack looks like.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.565
Yeah, but a lot of people like having sex
and not having a baby,

10:09.651 --> 10:11.187
so I don't know what the problem is.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.609
I met this baby the other day

10:12.695 --> 10:15.403
that was, like, wack as hell. Honestly.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.606
- Really?
- Okay.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.361
This is the Groupies site?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.568
It's not "Groupies." It's Grouper Date.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.449
And you're not bailing
because we need three people

10:22.539 --> 10:23.700
in order to get matched on a date.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.201
- Yes.
- Yeah, but look at them.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.624
Come look at these pictures.
These are the people we're competing with?

10:29.003 --> 10:31.586
Three Eurasian cocktail waitresses.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.791
- Yeah?
- Three Australian wakeboarders.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.300
And the Hadids!

10:37.303 --> 10:38.214
Is that the mom?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.465
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.639
I'm not competing with this.
I'm not doing it.

10:41.724 --> 10:45.058
Well, Renee, the thing is,
like, different kinds of men

10:45.145 --> 10:46.556
are looking for different things.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.060
Like, I mean, I know
that my guy is going to be interested

10:50.150 --> 10:53.109
in the fact that I like true crime

10:53.194 --> 10:55.652
and inter-species animal friendships.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.900
- Please...
- And I've added them all on dares...

10:57.991 --> 10:59.198
No, don't put that on the profile.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.367
Oh, my God, Viv,
nobody cares about the profile.

11:01.452 --> 11:02.988
No one even looks at the profile.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.163
The picture is all that matters,
and you get a picture of yourself

11:06.249 --> 11:08.036
and you feel, like, really good about it

11:08.126 --> 11:10.618
and you hide your double chin,
you hide your acne,

11:11.004 --> 11:12.085
and you hide your cellulite.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.336
And then when the guy meets you
in person, he's, like, so disappointed.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.416
Or you take a picture of yourself

11:17.510 --> 11:19.547
where you feel like
it really looks like you.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.424
And then you check your profile

11:21.514 --> 11:24.257
and no one is liking it
or clicking it or twitting it

11:24.350 --> 11:26.012
or... poking you.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.810
And you didn't even want to go out
with this guy in the first place.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.182
But he's rejecting you,
and... and it's not fair,

11:32.275 --> 11:33.311
and I'm sick of it.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.564
Well...

11:38.406 --> 11:41.820
You raise a lot
of interesting points, Renee.

11:41.910 --> 11:45.028
- And thank you for that pep talk.
- Yes, thank you.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.738
I feel like this is exactly
what we needed.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.948
You guys are jerks.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.908
Let's just take a fun picture.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.459
- Yeah.
- Let's just do it.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.707
- I'm a photo queen!
- Look at this face!

11:55.465 --> 11:56.626
- Whoo!
- Okay.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.629
That's not good.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.169
We look like we're being attacked, Viv.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.380
- That's bad.
- I look mid-poop.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.137
It looks like you're, like,
having sex with me.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.056
Viv!

12:12.065 --> 12:13.055
Okay...

12:13.149 --> 12:14.640
Okay... And three.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.108
And that's the one.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.985
What the hell, Mason?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.159
I spilled salad dressing on myself.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.114
God, look, I know this office
isn't the epicenter of anything,

12:29.207 --> 12:32.450
but once we stop feeling compelled
to participate in things like pants,

12:32.877 --> 12:34.869
we've gone too far outside
the social contract.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.829
We're in a crisis, Renee.
The server's down.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.380
It's happened before,
it always comes back online,

12:38.466 --> 12:40.628
- but not this time.
- Oh, no... Wait, wait.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.797
How are we going to get
the web traffic reports

12:42.887 --> 12:44.003
to Corporate for their 11:00 a.m.?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.588
It's our only job in this stupid office!

12:45.682 --> 12:47.890
I'm already printing out the reports,
and it's not stupid.

12:48.810 --> 12:49.721
Maybe a little.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.686
Either way, you can leave
our stupid office in about ten seconds.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.222
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:54.315 --> 12:56.147
You think I'm going
to Lily LeClaire today?

12:56.651 --> 12:59.268
Oh, no,
I am not going to Lily LeClaire.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.523
I promise you that, okay?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.229
- I did not shower.
- You never shower.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.193
I never shower for work.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.866
Okay, I shower at night.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.365
When I shower is my business.
I'm not going there.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.913
No. I'm wearing bathing suit bottoms
'cause I have no clean undies.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.538
I have a Bed Bath & Beyond bag
for my purse. No!

13:14.627 --> 13:15.834
Repeat after me.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.296
- I am brave.
- I am brave.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.214
- I am blonde.
- I am blonde.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.883
- And I got this.
- And I got this.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.052
- I am brave!
- I am brave!

13:25.138 --> 13:26.504
- I am blonde!
- I am blonde!

13:26.597 --> 13:27.883
- And I got this!
- And I got this!

13:27.974 --> 13:29.010
I am brave!

14:26.449 --> 14:27.530
For Steve in Marketing.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.859
Okay, great. I'll make sure she gets them.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.658
Is that Avery LeClaire?

14:38.753 --> 14:40.710
- Yeah.
- There she is again. Oh!

14:46.636 --> 14:49.128
Oh, my God. She's right there.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.554
Is that so cool?

14:50.640 --> 14:51.801
What's that?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.974
You know, being the receptionist here?
Just...

14:54.560 --> 14:55.767
being around it all?

14:55.853 --> 14:57.890
Well, I'm just an intern filling in.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.522
They're trying to find
a new receptionist, actually.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.148
Shut up.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.400
Oh, come on. It's like a dream job.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.320
Um, I'll make sure
Marketing gets these papers.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.397
Okay.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.732
I'm gonna head out.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.658
Can we all say hello
to my grandmother, Lily,

15:11.744 --> 15:12.860
who will be joining us today?

15:12.954 --> 15:14.070
Hello, Lily.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.405
We are in our third quarter
of our fiscal year,

15:16.499 --> 15:18.536
and as you are all aware,
the research results

15:18.626 --> 15:21.460
have come in on our diffusion line.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.334
Do you have to say "diffusion" like that?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.507
- Like what?
- Like it means "low end"?

15:27.593 --> 15:28.754
It does mean "low end."

15:29.554 --> 15:31.261
It also means "accessible."

15:32.265 --> 15:34.097
Or "thoughtfully priced."

15:34.183 --> 15:35.264
Say it like that.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.101
Okay.

15:39.772 --> 15:44.187
It seems that we have some work to do
on our diffusion line

15:44.277 --> 15:47.896
because we are new
to the diffusion landscape.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.072
We need to get people used
to seeing our products

15:50.158 --> 15:54.118
not just at Saks and Bendel's,
but also at Target and Kohl's.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.244
Jenn, go.

15:56.831 --> 16:00.871
Well, it says here that 74%
of core diffusion demo respondents

16:00.960 --> 16:02.952
strongly believe that we are...

16:03.796 --> 16:04.957
elitist pricks.

16:05.923 --> 16:10.964
Okay, so what I am hearing
is that we need to pivot in order...

16:12.138 --> 16:14.221
This is not rocket science, Avery.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.094
We're just trying to start...

16:17.101 --> 16:20.890
a line of accessible cosmetics at Target.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.438
Who here has gone
makeup shopping at Target?

16:23.900 --> 16:24.890
- You?
- No!

16:24.984 --> 16:26.270
- Either of you?
- Mmm.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.650
No.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.146
Unbelievable.

16:32.158 --> 16:37.119
People think that we are elitists
who do not belong at Target,

16:37.205 --> 16:38.662
and they may be right.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.115
But when people walk into this office,

16:41.375 --> 16:46.587
I want them to see that Lily LeClaire
includes everyone.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.835
Even bargain shoppers.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.177
"Must be passionate about beauty..."

16:58.684 --> 16:59.640
Me.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.594
"...and dream of sitting in our lobby..."

17:03.689 --> 17:04.554
Me.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.856
"...at the center of it all."

17:08.861 --> 17:11.523
"Must be stylish and full of confidence."

17:14.032 --> 17:15.022
I mean...

17:16.077 --> 17:18.034
Maybe not full of confidence.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.498
"The first face people see
when they come to our office,

17:22.583 --> 17:25.290
in some ways,
the real face of our beauty line."

17:27.547 --> 17:29.004
Whatever.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.256
Yes, it is the perfect job.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.054
Of course, I know that. I'm just...

17:38.516 --> 17:40.382
I don't even see a point in applying.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.683
I have no shot.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.431
Yeah.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.263
I'm not exactly the face
they're looking for.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.233
Oh. Hey, Jane, can I call you back?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.025
Hi.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.612
Um, Renee. We kind of met at SoulCycle...

18:01.706 --> 18:03.823
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.282
How's your vagina?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.496
- Oh.
- Like, the whole region?

18:07.587 --> 18:08.703
Thanks for asking.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.504
The region is kind of
as good as can be expected.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.502
Was there blood?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.083
There was not not-blood.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.257
Hey, hi.

18:15.886 --> 18:16.876
Wow.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.087
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, I'm so lost.

18:19.181 --> 18:22.265
Could you tell me where to find
that squeezy dish soap?

18:22.351 --> 18:23.432
- Uh...
- Yeah, you're probably wondering

18:23.519 --> 18:26.353
why I'm not asking, you know,
the person that obviously works here.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.304
But...

18:27.815 --> 18:28.851
I don't work here.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.775
But I've gotten really good at dishes.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.691
And so, I was just wondering
if you might have some dishes...

18:34.780 --> 18:37.614
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry, I forgot.
It's in aisle 10.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.657
- Hey, we're good, sir.
- Oh.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.699
I was thinking,
you can give me your number...

18:42.788 --> 18:45.280
Um, I'm so sorry,
I don't give out my number.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.956
It's nice to meet you.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.034
- So...
- It's nice to meet you.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.289
Good luck with the dishes
and everything else.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.369
Thank you.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.041
Does that kind of stuff
happen all the time?

18:56.636 --> 18:57.797
What, him?

18:57.887 --> 19:02.678
Yeah, like a guy, like, trying to hook up
with you in a totally normal place?

19:03.100 --> 19:05.308
Yeah, I'm sure that happens
to you all the time, too.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.764
Uh, no.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.720
That has literally never
happened to me in my life.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.022
- Okay, well, I don't believe you.
- Wait, can I ask you a question?

19:11.108 --> 19:12.064
Yeah.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.188
Did you ever go on a trip
to, like, Italy or something,

19:14.278 --> 19:16.611
and you land at the airport
and then, like...

19:17.573 --> 19:19.109
you meet these two guys,

19:19.200 --> 19:21.317
and they're like,
"Hey, come on this yacht with us,"

19:21.410 --> 19:24.574
and then you wind up going on
a yacht trip in, like, Capri.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.828
And it's like this whole other part
of your trip you didn't even foresee.

19:28.584 --> 19:29.791
- But, like...
- Yeah.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.538
I had one like that last summer.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.746
- In Greece, though, not Italy.
- I knew it.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.831
- I knew it! I knew it!
- Yeah.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.461
God, I knew that stuff happened.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.006
Oh, man, I've just...

19:40.096 --> 19:42.634
I've always wondered
what it feels like to be just...

19:44.141 --> 19:45.507
undeniably pretty.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.762
And just have all those parts in life
open up to you

19:49.855 --> 19:54.190
that... you only get to experience
when you look like you.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.279
Just once...

20:00.866 --> 20:03.529
- I mean...
- I don't think that this mascara

20:03.619 --> 20:07.454
or Wet n Wild bronzer can do
that kind of heavy lifting. So...

20:10.000 --> 20:11.536
I'll just pray for a miracle.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.868
Hey. It's not in 10.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.464
Nine. It was aisle nine.
Do you want me to show you?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.792
Can we get you back to register two?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.751
I don't work here.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.062
<i>Make my wish. Right.</i>

20:34.483 --> 20:36.190
<i>I wish I were big.</i>

20:58.591 --> 21:00.207
This is crazy! This is crazy!

21:01.677 --> 21:02.758
I wish...

21:03.262 --> 21:05.094
I wish I was beautiful!

21:22.114 --> 21:23.104
Please.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.364
Please, please, please. Please.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.226
What's up, SoHo? I'm Luna!

21:57.316 --> 21:59.148
Hey!

22:01.320 --> 22:02.777
Are you ready?

22:04.824 --> 22:07.532
All right, y'all, I don't know
what you came in here for today,

22:07.618 --> 22:10.986
but what I do know is that
the miracle is already here.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.951
You just have to open your heart
and receive it.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.577
I want you to look in the mirror

22:15.668 --> 22:18.035
and visualize the change
you came in here for.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.791
Is it spiritual? Is it physical?

22:21.048 --> 22:22.334
Is it emotional?

22:22.925 --> 22:25.759
Today I want you to look in the mirror.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.087
You're not going to see
what you normally see.

22:28.180 --> 22:33.175
Today you're going to see
what you've always wanted to be.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.264
So, you ready to get your life?

22:35.354 --> 22:39.098
SoHo, are you ready to get your life?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.602
Change your mind!

22:40.693 --> 22:43.231
Change your body! Change your life!

22:43.320 --> 22:44.606
Yeah!

22:44.697 --> 22:45.938
Coming out of the saddle

22:46.031 --> 22:48.023
in three, two, one! Up!

22:52.705 --> 22:53.946
Oh, my God, are you okay?

22:58.544 --> 22:59.705
We got a white girl down.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.051
Hey.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.053
You hit your head really hard
on the way down.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.436
Oh. Sorry. Oh, God.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.810
Here's an ice pack.

23:21.901 --> 23:25.065
Oh, God, thank you.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.778
And some water.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.241
And we have a complimentary bandana.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.197
- So...
- Aww.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.495
You didn't have to do that.
This is too much.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.417
This is huge.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.336
Did something happen to your arm?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.970
Should I call a doctor?

23:57.770 --> 24:00.262
Yeah...

24:11.367 --> 24:12.448
Are your legs okay?

24:12.534 --> 24:15.948
No! They're not okay.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.946
They're...

24:19.124 --> 24:22.117
amazing. Oh, my God.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.540
Do I look super toned to you?

24:24.797 --> 24:25.787
Uh...

24:25.881 --> 24:27.918
I don't know how to answer that.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.883
- Oh, my God, feel my abs!
- Uh...

24:30.970 --> 24:33.053
- Rock hard, right?
- Feels full.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.595
- It's a rock.
- Uh-huh.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.381
Wait...

24:47.820 --> 24:48.776
Wait.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.862
Wait, no.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.153
Wait.

24:55.035 --> 24:55.946
Wait.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.492
- That's me?
- Yeah.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.073
No.

25:08.215 --> 25:12.175
What? Oh, my God, do you see this?

25:12.511 --> 25:13.422
Yes?

25:13.512 --> 25:17.677
I mean... look at me! Look at my jawline!

25:18.350 --> 25:20.433
No, no, I always...
I always wanted this to happen.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.930
You dream this will happen,

25:22.021 --> 25:23.478
but I never thought
it would really happen!

25:23.564 --> 25:24.850
I mean... look at me!

25:24.940 --> 25:27.478
Look at my boobs! Look at my ass!

25:29.194 --> 25:30.150
I'm...

25:32.031 --> 25:33.272
beautiful!

25:36.577 --> 25:39.194
All right, if you're good,

25:39.997 --> 25:41.863
I'm going to take this back
and go to the front.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.956
As long as you don't sue.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.319
Hey, great dress.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.570
Thanks. It's from Target.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.617
Of course it is.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.286
Aren't girls like us so lucky,

26:22.372 --> 26:25.991
that we can shop, like, anywhere
and still look fly as hell?

26:26.085 --> 26:27.576
- I guess.
- Yeah!

26:30.881 --> 26:33.248
Oh, gosh! Thank you.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.875
Chivalry, alive and well.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.384
Jimmy, come here!

26:46.605 --> 26:47.436
Mwah!

26:55.364 --> 26:56.775
For Lisa in HR.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.572
My name's Renee Bennett,

26:58.659 --> 27:00.742
and I'm applying for the receptionist job.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.295
Don't scream.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.209
Slowly turn around.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.635
Okay, I know you don't recognize me.

27:22.724 --> 27:23.805
- I know that.
- Mmm.

27:23.892 --> 27:27.181
But I'm going to prove to you
that I am your friend.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.058
- Your good friend...
- Hey, sluts.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.982
Oh, my God. Okay. Don't scream.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.559
No, no one...
no one is screaming.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.652
Don't even make the noise you just made.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.907
Okay. Okay, now I know
you don't recognize me.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.035
You're thinking, "Who is this girl?
And why is she here?

27:44.121 --> 27:47.410
What was she doing covering
our screaming-ass mouths?"

27:47.666 --> 27:49.578
You guys, it's me.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.660
Renee.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.123
What's happening?

27:57.759 --> 27:58.840
Full spin.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.755
Oh, my God, you don't believe me.

28:03.849 --> 28:04.839
Why would you? Okay.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.095
I'm going to prove to you that I'm Renee.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.768
All right, I'm just going
to tell you something

28:08.854 --> 28:11.062
that there's no way I would know
unless I was Renee.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.514
Okay. Um...

28:12.816 --> 28:15.809
Oh, remember the summer
we all were gonna get those tattoos

28:15.903 --> 28:18.441
of the <i>90210</i> characters
on our ankle. Right?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.487
But we decided not to
because we were like,

28:20.574 --> 28:23.112
"What if we don't always feel
this strongly about the actors?"

28:23.202 --> 28:25.194
Thank God. How would anyone know that?

28:25.287 --> 28:27.654
Everyone would know that, right?

28:27.748 --> 28:30.456
Because I actually got Andrea Zuckerman

28:30.542 --> 28:33.876
tattooed on my ankle
before you guys bailed on the idea.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.294
I forgot that, I'm sorry.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.121
- I still feel so bad.
- No.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.048
What's something only
I would know? Help me.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.713
You have HPV.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.795
- Everybody has HPV.
- I have it, too.

28:43.889 --> 28:47.098
The point is, it's me! Renee!

28:47.684 --> 28:50.176
And I don't know how this happened,
and I can't explain it.

28:50.270 --> 28:54.105
All I know is that Luna
reached into my SoulCycled soul

28:54.191 --> 28:56.478
and just gave me what I've always wanted.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.563
The chance to be beautiful!

29:00.030 --> 29:00.895
Oh.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.732
- Yeah, well, that's great.
- Yeah.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.492
- I'm so happy for you...
- Are you?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.444
...that you are working out

29:08.538 --> 29:11.952
and that that clearly is making,
like, a big change for you.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.624
I mean, like, I hear really good things

29:13.710 --> 29:16.578
about SoulCycle and, like, you look great.

29:16.672 --> 29:20.666
Great? Guys, I'm a Kardashian.
One of the Jenner ones.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.797
Maybe now that your contacts are in...

29:23.887 --> 29:26.004
I don't wear contacts.
I don't wear glasses.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.589
I was just taking a swing,

29:27.683 --> 29:29.515
- and it was a miss.
- Yeah.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.469
You're trying to make sense
of this, and you can't.

29:32.562 --> 29:34.975
That's true. We cannot make sense of this.

29:35.065 --> 29:37.182
But I want you guys to know
that even though I look like

29:37.276 --> 29:40.269
this very different, very hot person,

29:40.862 --> 29:42.273
it's still me in here.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.729
It's Renee.

29:44.074 --> 29:46.191
I'm not going anywhere.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.072
- Okay.
- Okay?

29:48.161 --> 29:49.322
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.949
But I am going to go to the bar
and get us drinks.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.200
I could use one.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.782
- Tequila?
- Sure.

29:54.334 --> 29:57.372
How would I know that, unless I was Renee?

29:58.005 --> 29:59.121
Okay.

30:06.763 --> 30:11.303
Hey, Mason.
I'm sorry I can't make it again.

30:12.102 --> 30:13.968
I'll have to work remotely,
I have pink eye.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.182
Yeah, it's really bad.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.932
It's like, it looks like
my eyes are bleeding.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.812
Um...

30:21.445 --> 30:24.062
Yeah, no, I... I know
it doesn't affect your voice,

30:24.156 --> 30:25.897
but it's like the really bad kind

30:25.991 --> 30:28.404
that, like, causes flare-ups
in prison populations.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.825
Look, I gotta go, I'm going to the doctor.

30:29.911 --> 30:34.451
Hopefully, I'll be in tomorrow,
but I'm going in the subway, so I'm...

30:34.666 --> 30:36.453
Um... Hello? Hello?

30:36.543 --> 30:37.750
116.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.375
Uh...

30:42.507 --> 30:44.419
You probably haven't been here before,

30:44.509 --> 30:46.250
but you have to wait in line
and take a number.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.964
- Oh, right.
- I can grab it for you.

30:48.055 --> 30:49.262
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.431
- I just... Here.
- Thank you.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.259
And this guy just calls out a number
completely out of sequence.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.345
- Okay.
- It's like a weird game of bingo.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.019
- All right.
- But no one wins. So, yeah.

31:01.777 --> 31:02.767
What's your number?

31:08.200 --> 31:09.441
So this is how it happens?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.782
Just like that? Wow.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.788
Just like what? What happens, like what?

31:15.874 --> 31:16.864
That is very clever.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.204
I don't know why that's... What is clever?

31:19.294 --> 31:21.160
- "What's your number?"
- I'm just asking what the number is.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.622
And then I go, "Oh, 118..."

31:23.715 --> 31:25.832
And then you're like,
"No, your phone number."

31:26.510 --> 31:28.092
- Oh.
- Yeah. You are good.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.090
How long have you been hanging
on to that little nugget?

31:30.180 --> 31:32.422
I haven't. I haven't been holding
on to that. That's not a nugget.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.930
You hang out in a lot of dry cleaners
and hit on perfect girls?

31:36.019 --> 31:38.136
Wow.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.562
All right, give me your phone.

31:40.065 --> 31:40.896
My phone?

31:40.982 --> 31:42.063
Give me your phone,
I'm going to give you my number.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.142
- Are you still talking to me?
- Don't chicken out now, son.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.522
- I'm not chickening out.
- Here, come on.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.399
Give me, we'll exchange phones.
That's what'll happen.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.355
Here, give me your phone,
you take my phone,

31:49.449 --> 31:51.406
put your number in.
Level the playing field.

31:51.493 --> 31:52.404
Do people do this?

31:52.494 --> 31:54.076
And this way you don't have
to feel intimidated.

31:54.621 --> 31:55.737
I know what it's like.

31:55.831 --> 31:59.324
Okay. Yeah. That's me.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.454
Okay.

32:00.544 --> 32:02.752
And you know,
I'm pretty slammed right now.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.830
But I will do my best to pencil you in.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.085
Right after the jailhouse
pink eye clears up?

32:09.052 --> 32:10.042
Who are you?

32:10.387 --> 32:11.594
Number 118!

32:13.974 --> 32:14.964
That's me.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.260
Hi.

32:20.689 --> 32:24.023
Oh, I couldn't get
the red vomit stain out of it.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.816
What was it, like, sangria?

32:26.111 --> 32:28.228
Some wine, like a red?
Something like that?

32:28.321 --> 32:30.187
It had chunks in it, did you know that?

32:30.282 --> 32:33.150
And, uh, then you let it sit for a while,
and I couldn't really...

32:33.243 --> 32:34.279
That's fine.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.827
I could take another whack at it,
if you want.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.371
I'm not a magician. 119!

32:41.209 --> 32:43.917
So, look, I have not
logged into our account

32:44.004 --> 32:45.370
since our profile went live

32:45.464 --> 32:46.671
'cause I thought we could
all do it together.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.622
Yeah, I think that's the best idea.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.549
Um, excuse me, bartender.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.048
Can I please get
a couple shots of tequila?

32:53.346 --> 32:55.383
- Uh...
- Can you stop it? It's a coffee shop.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.887
No, listen. This is going to be awesome.
Trust me.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.138
I'm about to make it rain responses.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.066
Hit refresh.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.985
- Yeah, refresh.
- Always refresh.

33:13.283 --> 33:14.148
Okay...

33:14.242 --> 33:16.404
- Are we on the Wi-Fi or...
- Yeah, we are.

33:16.495 --> 33:20.330
So, it's true. Guys really
only care about photos.

33:20.624 --> 33:24.163
Oh, my God, stop. This is...
This is clearly my fault.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.166
- What? Why?
- No, I take full responsibility for this.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.589
Guys, this is because the old me
was clearly dragging our stock down.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.419
I, like, feel bad for her.
I wanna, like, hug this girl.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.220
You look like you.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.673
All we have to do
are get new photos of me.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.767
You know, like, a photo shoot
for the new Renee.

33:41.853 --> 33:46.598
Like maybe a hip-hop vibe.
Like Saint-Tropez, or...

33:47.234 --> 33:49.066
You know, let's get this in a bikini,

33:49.402 --> 33:53.112
on a jet ski with, like, Lil Wayne,

33:53.198 --> 33:56.111
or Lil' Bow Wow, or one of the Lil's.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.113
- I don't think that's a thing.
- Which thing?

33:58.203 --> 33:59.694
The whole... Like, all those things.

33:59.788 --> 34:03.702
One of the... a big one...
Big... Medium George?

34:03.792 --> 34:05.454
I don't know who it is,
but it's gonna be hip-hop

34:05.544 --> 34:06.785
and it's gonna be hot.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.542
No, we're going to do it.
Hot bikini action.

34:10.757 --> 34:11.964
You know, I don't have a yacht, but...

34:12.467 --> 34:13.878
Does your brother still have a kayak?

34:14.219 --> 34:16.335
<i>Hi, this message is for Renee Bennett.</i>

34:16.429 --> 34:19.137
<i>Please call Helen Grey's office
at Lily LeClaire</i>

34:19.224 --> 34:22.092
<i>to set up your interview
for the receptionist position.</i>

34:45.083 --> 34:46.164
Renee Bennett?

34:46.251 --> 34:48.664
Yeah. I'm Renee. Hi.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.295
No, I'm looking for Renee Bennett
for the receptionist job.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.339
That's me. Here.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.050
Okay.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.346
You must be Renee. I'm Helen Grey, CFO.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.392
We spoke on the phone.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.304
And this is our CEO, Avery LeClaire.

35:08.398 --> 35:09.309
Hello, Renee.

35:09.399 --> 35:10.264
Hello.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.065
Take a seat, make yourself comfortable.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.393
Thank you so much.

35:14.946 --> 35:18.110
Uh, it's nice to finally meet you
face to face, Ms. Grey.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.693
And I of course know
who you are, Ms. LeClaire.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.866
Renee currently works
in the online division.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.037
Oh, wow, super.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.959
Yeah, but I figure
I can be real with you guys,

35:30.045 --> 35:34.039
like Gayle King real,
and say that it would be a shame

35:34.132 --> 35:37.967
to waste all this
in a tiny Chinatown office.

35:38.803 --> 35:42.592
I think we've got more of
a front-of-house situation on our hands.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.056
Am I right or wrong? Yeah.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.100
Renee, we appreciate
you taking the initiative,

35:47.187 --> 35:49.645
but you're not exactly
the obvious choice for this job.

35:51.066 --> 35:52.022
Helen.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.726
No, I totally get it.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.644
'Cause I already work for the company,

35:56.738 --> 36:00.448
and this job would actually be
a pay cut to my current salary.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.320
It doesn't make much sense why I'm here.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.197
So what are your goals, exactly?

36:07.040 --> 36:09.498
To work here...

36:12.212 --> 36:13.578
as a receptionist.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.162
Wow.

36:17.008 --> 36:21.127
Okay, because most girls, they view this
as a stepping stone to modeling

36:21.221 --> 36:24.259
or to opening
their own e-commerce boutique.

36:24.349 --> 36:28.184
I hear you. And yes,
modeling is an option for me.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.094
You are taking a risk.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.475
Is this girl going to walk out
of this office

36:32.565 --> 36:35.057
and right onto the runway
and never look back?

36:35.568 --> 36:36.854
Is that realistic for me?

36:37.529 --> 36:41.318
One thousand percent.
But it's not who I am.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.368
My only real goal is to come here

36:45.453 --> 36:47.911
to this office every day

36:48.665 --> 36:50.531
and help people feel the same way I feel

36:51.084 --> 36:53.497
when I step off that elevator:

36:53.586 --> 36:57.830
that this is the only place to be.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.596
Yes, yes, yes, yes! I got it!

37:23.283 --> 37:24.740
I work here now!

37:28.204 --> 37:29.411
Mason, you in here?

37:30.540 --> 37:31.701
It's me, Renee.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.123
Can we talk in the office?

37:33.209 --> 37:35.166
Oh, we can just talk here, it's fine.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.336
Things have changed for me, Mason.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.002
They're moving me to HQ.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.251
It's headquarters.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.844
- Everything I've ever wanted...
- I really need you to leave.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.013
I really would rather you
not hear the splash.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.385
Don't worry, I...

37:49.976 --> 37:53.720
I talked to them, and HR is already
interviewing for my replacement.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.971
HR is just human resources.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.352
Go, please. Go.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.526
And I know you're happy here.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.319
But anyway, I gotta go.

38:02.405 --> 38:06.149
If you just finally got the courage
to ask me out, it's too late, buddy.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.279
Go, please. Go.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.696
I'll miss you.
You want me to leave it open?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.372
- Uh... No.
- No?

38:17.587 --> 38:18.452
Shit!

38:43.446 --> 38:44.482
Whoo!

38:47.492 --> 38:48.949
You're gonna wanna head to marketing,

38:49.035 --> 38:50.242
and you're gonna want
to have a great time.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.658
She's headed to you, she's adorable.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.580
Good morning.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.668
Hi, you know what?
I think I pressed the wrong floor.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.420
I'm looking for Lily LeClaire,
and this is not...

39:05.510 --> 39:07.092
Nope, that's us.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.464
Welcome to Lily LeClaire.

39:08.805 --> 39:11.593
You're probably used
to seeing Angie sit here,

39:11.683 --> 39:13.424
but I promise to win you over, too.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.097
She served her bottled water room temp.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.474
Now, I prefer to serve it chilled.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.814
I also serve it with a straw,

39:20.900 --> 39:23.438
so you don't have to mess
with your fierce lipstick.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.110
God, I love that shade.

39:25.196 --> 39:28.940
What is it, Rogue Red? Fall 2015?

39:30.368 --> 39:32.030
I don't know any Angie.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.112
What confused me
when I walked into this place,

39:34.205 --> 39:37.949
honestly, is you and...

39:39.294 --> 39:40.876
I know, right?

39:41.212 --> 39:43.795
You're not the only one. Okay.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.295
People don't expect a girl
sitting back here

39:46.384 --> 39:48.125
to just be so on the ball.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.426
Oh, see, that's not what I was...

39:49.512 --> 39:51.174
But I know what it means to work hard.

39:51.264 --> 39:54.803
And I don't plan on coasting off
the bennies of this face or this body.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.885
I'm going to bring it every day.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.971
I can see by your portfolio
that you're here from <i>The Rose Sheet,</i>

40:00.064 --> 40:02.727
which happens to be
my absolute favorite trade publication.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.601
So I'll let them know
that you're here for your 10:30,

40:05.695 --> 40:06.776
and you can have a seat.

40:06.863 --> 40:10.152
Or if you prefer, get steps in
to meet your Fitbit goal for the day.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.573
This hallway loops around,

40:11.659 --> 40:13.116
and I'll let you know when they're ready.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.245
Welcome to Lily LeClaire.

40:16.497 --> 40:17.613
Thanks.

40:17.707 --> 40:18.697
And my name is Renee,

40:18.791 --> 40:21.374
if you need absolutely anything at all.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.160
Ever, ever.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.664
Hi, Lily LeClaire, you've got Renee.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.919
Oh, I'll put you through.

40:28.009 --> 40:28.920
Hello, Renee.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.676
Sorry. I overheard your name.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.928
Uh, I'm here to meet Avery,

40:38.019 --> 40:40.602
but could you not make me wait
next to that lady?

40:41.439 --> 40:43.146
I don't think I'll be as nice to her
as you were.

40:44.734 --> 40:47.943
Oh, thank God. Okay, okay.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.022
- You're Grant LeClaire.
- Yes.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.826
Holy shit. Holy shit.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.528
Relax, you're good.

40:58.247 --> 41:00.239
Okay, okay.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.540
Right. Um...

41:02.001 --> 41:04.709
Well, Grant, I noticed on <i>Page Six,</i>

41:04.796 --> 41:10.884
that you are often photographed drinking
these Pressed Juicery Greens 1.5.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.301
Correct? I saw that,

41:12.387 --> 41:14.549
and I brought it here,
in case you were ever to come in.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.381
- Thank you.
- You're welcome,

41:17.475 --> 41:18.511
Grant LeClaire.

41:19.102 --> 41:20.934
Sorry, what, you've seen me holding these?

41:21.729 --> 41:23.345
So you got them in just for me?

41:23.439 --> 41:25.476
I've also seen you holding
a lot of Brazilian models,

41:25.566 --> 41:27.148
but I didn't think
they'd fit in the mini-fridge.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.902
Okay, cool, I thought
you were gonna be mad

41:33.992 --> 41:35.574
'cause I called you out so hard.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.821
Who hired you, Renee?

41:37.078 --> 41:39.821
Avery. Your sister.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.325
Yes, I know who she is.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.954
Good. 'Cause Thanksgiving
would be really weird.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.911
I don't know if you guys do things
like Thanksgiving.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.371
Yeah, we do.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.000
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

41:50.383 --> 41:51.624
So, Avery, huh?

41:53.886 --> 41:54.842
Good for her.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.004
Yes.

42:00.476 --> 42:01.762
Oh, my God.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.266
This is our first diffusion line,

42:08.359 --> 42:11.523
and I really owe it to my grandma
to get it right.

42:11.612 --> 42:14.776
We are at a critical stage
for both the product itself

42:14.866 --> 42:16.607
and the packaging and the copy.

42:16.701 --> 42:19.284
So, now for the exciting part,
let's look at our samples.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.077
This is our...

42:21.164 --> 42:23.451
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.328
I am so sorry!

42:25.418 --> 42:27.410
Okay, going to put it
all right back where it was.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.539
Here is the blush.

42:28.838 --> 42:31.581
All right, and here is the packaging,

42:31.674 --> 42:33.631
and I just need to find
the application brush,

42:33.718 --> 42:35.050
and then we can move on with our lives.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.549
There is no application brush.

42:39.474 --> 42:40.430
Oh.

42:44.479 --> 42:45.560
Really?

42:46.189 --> 42:47.396
Okay. Got it.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.390
Does that come as a surprise to you?

42:49.484 --> 42:50.474
Because if you knew our products,

42:50.568 --> 42:52.935
you'd know that our blush never comes
with an application blush brush.

42:53.029 --> 42:53.985
Of course I know that.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.313
Same with the Shimmering Face Powders.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.739
I just figured
for this particular product,

42:57.825 --> 42:59.612
that, you know, that there might be one.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.944
But never mind, you guys,
you know how this works,

43:02.038 --> 43:05.327
and I'm just the beautiful face
keeping this place running. So...

43:06.417 --> 43:08.784
I think we'd all like to hear
what you'd have to say, Renee.

43:12.757 --> 43:13.668
Well...

43:15.551 --> 43:18.009
Well, with high-end products,

43:18.096 --> 43:21.260
we expect our customers
to have high-end makeup brushes.

43:22.266 --> 43:27.227
But regular girls put their blush on
in the rearview,

43:27.313 --> 43:28.929
on the way to their crappy jobs.

43:29.023 --> 43:32.858
And they're going to be pissed
when they open up an $8.50 blush,

43:32.944 --> 43:34.685
and they have no way they can use it.

43:35.113 --> 43:37.025
Then you just wind up using your finger.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.777
You know, it never goes on right.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.654
Then you hit a bump, or you have an itch

43:41.744 --> 43:44.612
and you wind up looking like <i>Braveheart.</i>

43:45.748 --> 43:49.287
Or some more up-to-date reference.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.327
That was very helpful, Renee.

43:52.421 --> 43:53.377
Really?

43:54.757 --> 43:55.964
Okay, great.

43:56.759 --> 43:58.876
If anybody needs anything,
any water or anything,

43:58.970 --> 44:00.051
just give me a signal.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.095
The signal will just be something like,

44:02.181 --> 44:04.798
"Renee, we could use some more water."

44:05.476 --> 44:06.887
Or something, you know...

44:06.978 --> 44:10.221
"Thirsty, more water."

44:11.274 --> 44:12.310
Thank you.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.083
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, Ethan.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.163
Um...

44:36.591 --> 44:40.835
I know calling a new love interest
can be stressful,

44:41.179 --> 44:44.297
so I just wanted
to take that pressure off you.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.349
You know, you wonder, like,
"How long should I wait to call?"

44:47.435 --> 44:50.769
Or, "Is she too good for me?"
Blah, blah, blah.

44:50.855 --> 44:55.896
But, uh, I'm just gonna
take all the heavy lifting off of you

44:55.985 --> 44:58.693
and... and let you know
that you are taking me out.

44:58.988 --> 45:00.445
<i>Who is this again?</i>

45:01.199 --> 45:03.907
Oh, yeah, Renee from the dry cleaner.

45:06.204 --> 45:07.615
Aren't you glad we're doing this?

45:07.705 --> 45:09.822
I'm pretty scared of you,

45:09.916 --> 45:12.454
so I was a little afraid to not do this.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.533
Right.

45:13.794 --> 45:14.705
So what do you do?

45:14.795 --> 45:17.663
Uh... I'm at CNN, working in operations.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.543
It's not what I want to do.
I'm trying to segue

45:19.634 --> 45:20.715
- into being a cameraman.
- Oh.

45:20.801 --> 45:23.965
But, uh, it's sort of
a boys' club over there.

45:24.055 --> 45:26.047
So I can't just...

45:27.016 --> 45:28.006
What?

45:28.893 --> 45:32.557
Well, only girls complain about things
being a boys' club.

45:33.731 --> 45:37.645
Yes, good point, but I mean it's like
a different breed of, like, boys' club.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.648
Like tattoos, C-class driver's licenses.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.695
I'm sure you're just
in your head about it.

45:42.782 --> 45:43.772
They call me "Wheat Thin."

45:44.200 --> 45:47.068
Oh, 'cause of "Ethan." That's clever.

45:49.205 --> 45:51.071
"Wheat Thin Ethan." That is it!

45:51.165 --> 45:52.155
Hot dogs.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.582
Wheat Thin Ethan.

45:54.043 --> 45:55.955
That's not even as bad
as what I thought they meant.

45:56.045 --> 45:59.413
No, I mean, I used to be
where you are right now.

45:59.924 --> 46:03.383
I was working
in this tiny office, like tiny.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.921
And I never thought
I'd make it to 5th Avenue.

46:08.432 --> 46:11.971
But, I mean, look at me now.
I'm a receptionist.

46:13.187 --> 46:15.520
I haven't said that
out loud yet.

46:15.606 --> 46:19.441
I, Renee, am a receptionist.

46:20.861 --> 46:23.774
Oh, that was my hot dog.
You ate both of them.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.865
Ooh, a bikini contest! We're going!

46:29.912 --> 46:31.619
You sure this is where you want to be?

46:31.706 --> 46:34.824
There's a bar just down the thing,
they're doing Latin rhythms night.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.249
Oh, we should hit that next.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.418
Yeah. Or sooner.

46:38.504 --> 46:41.622
Right here. Hi. Anybody sitting here? No?

46:41.716 --> 46:43.048
You sure no one's sitting here?

46:43.134 --> 46:44.215
Oh, my God, it's, like, starting.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.589
You know, uh, I'm cool with this.

46:46.679 --> 46:50.263
As long as you're comfortable sitting here

46:50.349 --> 46:52.636
while these women are kind of naked.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.806
Kind of? They look great.

46:55.813 --> 46:56.894
What are you doing?

46:56.981 --> 46:59.143
Well, I don't have a bathing suit,
so I have to improvise.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.150
Kind of hotter than a bathing suit,

47:02.236 --> 47:03.647
because it's, like, unexpected,

47:03.738 --> 47:05.070
and you can, like, see most of my butt.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.818
Wait, are you entering the bikini contest?

47:06.907 --> 47:07.988
- Yeah!
- No!

47:08.075 --> 47:09.907
It's 500 bucks to the winner.
Did you see the sign?

47:09.994 --> 47:13.237
Yeah, but I think that you probably
had to pre-register online,

47:13.331 --> 47:16.369
and then there's also the issue
of the non-regulation bikini.

47:16.459 --> 47:18.746
- Honestly, that Latin rhythms night...
- It'll be so fun.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.327
Oh, wait, I see what's going on.

47:21.047 --> 47:24.040
You're worried that the guys
are going to be drooling all over me.

47:24.133 --> 47:27.171
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, my God, that's so sweet.

47:27.261 --> 47:30.675
But don't worry, okay? I'm here with you.

47:31.766 --> 47:34.429
I came with you and I'm leaving with you.

47:35.269 --> 47:37.807
But I do need your help with something.

47:38.564 --> 47:41.307
Now, what do you think?
Shoe on or shoe off?

47:41.400 --> 47:43.062
- This is off.
- Right.

47:43.152 --> 47:44.108
This is me with it on.

47:44.195 --> 47:46.357
Does it say, like, "Barefoot hippie,
she doesn't care"?

47:46.447 --> 47:48.154
- Or is it like...
- Honestly, at the end of the day,

47:48.240 --> 47:50.527
I don't know if it's gonna have
a dramatic effect either way,

47:50.618 --> 47:53.577
so I would go shoes on
because the carpet is disgusting.

47:53.662 --> 47:55.244
Okay, cool. Wish me luck.

47:55.331 --> 47:56.447
Good luck.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.826
- I got this.
- Yeah.

47:59.668 --> 48:01.079
So scared.

48:01.170 --> 48:06.382
Welcome to the semi-annual
Ruby's Bangin' Bikini Contest.

48:06.467 --> 48:08.379
We're going to start it out
and do it proud.

48:08.469 --> 48:10.836
Here she comes, everybody.
Let's bring out our girl.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.466
Lacey J.

48:12.556 --> 48:16.015
She's pursuing her certificate
in heating and cooling maintenance.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.389
Fire and ice, she sure is!

48:18.979 --> 48:21.392
Is there a doctor in the house? No!

48:21.482 --> 48:25.192
But there is a dental assistant,
and her name's Tiffany from Ronkonkoma.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.147
Look at that!

48:27.238 --> 48:28.649
Oh! Whoa!

48:28.739 --> 48:30.446
Twerk it up, honey!

48:31.158 --> 48:33.115
Watch out, guys, it's about to heat up,

48:33.202 --> 48:35.114
'cause here comes Vanessa!

48:35.579 --> 48:38.538
Our Vanessa here has been
to 11 of our United States.

48:38.624 --> 48:40.991
So give it up for Vanessa!

48:41.085 --> 48:43.168
Oh, we've got a late entry here.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.917
Uh, I hope her buns
are tighter than this penmanship

48:46.006 --> 48:48.419
'cause, uh, this is really hard to read.
But, um...

48:48.717 --> 48:52.301
"Keep it going for Renee Bennett"?

48:52.388 --> 48:53.424
Renee Bennett.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.767
Whoa, are you here
for the barback job or...

48:59.937 --> 49:01.018
You're in the contest? Okay.

49:01.105 --> 49:03.017
- I got it. I got it.
- You got it? Okay.

49:03.107 --> 49:07.397
Hello, everyone, I am Renee!
As advertised!

49:07.820 --> 49:11.313
Renee hails from the Long Island,

49:11.407 --> 49:13.649
and she is a receptionist.

49:13.993 --> 49:14.983
Holler!

49:15.453 --> 49:17.570
Um, Renee enjoys watching people

49:17.663 --> 49:21.202
trying to cover up their disappointment
from their dreams being shattered

49:21.292 --> 49:25.411
on shows such as
<i>Antiques Roadshow</i> and <i>Shark Tank.</i>

49:25.880 --> 49:31.797
And Renee is not afraid
of returning things for store credit!

49:34.138 --> 49:37.051
Renee was kicked out not once, but twice

49:37.141 --> 49:41.055
from a New Kids on the Block concert
for crying too hard.

49:42.938 --> 49:46.022
Joey! Am I right? Joey!

49:46.108 --> 49:47.098
Marry me!

49:47.193 --> 49:49.560
And although you ladies
all seem super chill,

49:49.653 --> 49:50.814
I did not come here

49:50.905 --> 49:52.862
to make friends, okay?

49:53.657 --> 49:55.364
DJ, hit it!

51:30.212 --> 51:32.955
And now it's time to tally the votes.

51:33.048 --> 51:34.334
Are you guys ready?

51:36.885 --> 51:40.378
The winner of this year's
Ruby's Bangin' Bikini Contest...

51:41.015 --> 51:44.258
Lacey J. from New Brunswick,
New Jersey! Lacey!

51:47.855 --> 51:51.098
Take a lap! Come on, Lacey! Beautiful!

51:52.484 --> 51:54.350
Don't worry, Romeo, she'll be right out.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.607
Yeah, I didn't know if they go backstage.

51:56.697 --> 51:57.813
Is there a backstage here?

51:57.906 --> 51:59.363
Yeah, it usually leads to rehab.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.191
But that Renee? That's your girl, right?

52:01.285 --> 52:03.368
- Uh, friend for now.
- Friend?

52:03.454 --> 52:05.616
Just friend, this is our first
kind of night out.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.197
All right, I didn't ask for a podcast.

52:07.291 --> 52:10.204
Either way, your lady killed it tonight.

52:10.294 --> 52:11.205
She is awesome.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.786
She is the complete package.

52:13.172 --> 52:14.708
Yeah, I'm getting to know that.

52:14.798 --> 52:17.165
Um, I've never seen anything like that.

52:17.259 --> 52:20.502
Now the girl who won,
who happens to be my god-niece,

52:20.596 --> 52:22.553
of course, she was hotter.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.302
But let's say this,

52:24.391 --> 52:26.508
it's a lonely dark night, you got a flat.

52:26.602 --> 52:27.809
Who do you want next to you?

52:27.978 --> 52:29.389
Your girl. Yeah.

52:29.480 --> 52:32.644
Your girl can handle herself
in a knife fight, and I like that.

52:32.733 --> 52:33.723
Dude, up here.

52:33.817 --> 52:35.809
- Uh, thank you.
- Tonight's your night, good luck.

52:39.990 --> 52:42.073
- Hey, that was so great.
- Hi.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.741
Sorry, I got you all wet.

52:43.827 --> 52:46.160
Oh, yeah, that's water, right?

52:46.413 --> 52:48.075
Yeah, I think it's water.

52:48.457 --> 52:51.200
I'm sorry it didn't go
the way you wanted it to.

52:51.293 --> 52:52.704
I mean, it was awesome.

52:52.795 --> 52:56.084
Yeah. No, it didn't. It went way better.

52:56.465 --> 52:57.251
What?

52:57.341 --> 52:59.833
We each get two free drinks
and an appetizer!

52:59.927 --> 53:01.088
That's what I was hoping.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.589
- On the house.
- What are the parting gifts?

53:02.680 --> 53:05.218
I was looking at the coconut shrimp,
'cause I didn't get any hot dog.

53:05.307 --> 53:06.843
You snooze, you lose your hot dog.

53:06.934 --> 53:07.924
You're really not upset?

53:08.018 --> 53:09.350
No, not really.

53:09.812 --> 53:12.725
I mean, these things
are so, like, political.

53:13.649 --> 53:15.265
- Yeah.
- I won't get into all of it.

53:15.359 --> 53:17.476
Mostly 'cause I have
no information, but...

53:17.861 --> 53:20.274
No, I can see a place like this
running kind of a shady...

53:20.364 --> 53:22.026
Yeah. I feel like I did win.

53:22.116 --> 53:23.652
The crowd was going crazy.

53:23.992 --> 53:26.951
And you know what? I know I look good.

53:27.037 --> 53:30.280
I don't need some, like, room
of drunk guys to confirm that.

53:30.958 --> 53:33.371
Can I be you when I grow up?

53:34.712 --> 53:36.544
You should've won, you were ripped off.

53:37.589 --> 53:38.579
Thanks.

53:38.674 --> 53:40.040
I think I've earned this, right?

53:40.718 --> 53:43.051
That was just sitting there.
That's not even mine.

53:43.137 --> 53:44.969
Mmm.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.221
Renee.

53:52.020 --> 53:53.306
I thought I smelled animal products.

53:53.647 --> 53:55.604
- Mmm.
- Can I ask you something?

53:55.691 --> 53:56.522
Mmm-hmm.

53:56.608 --> 53:58.520
Just because you seemed to have
such great insight

53:58.610 --> 54:00.567
about our diffusion line earlier.

54:00.654 --> 54:03.897
Yeah, of course. I'm... I'm here to help.

54:04.616 --> 54:07.484
My grandma is coming to review everything

54:07.578 --> 54:09.661
for the big pitch
to the Target people in Boston,

54:09.747 --> 54:11.955
and I just really want to make sure
that I get everything right.

54:13.584 --> 54:14.825
Super, yeah.

54:15.919 --> 54:17.876
- Oh!
- So, I had this great idea.

54:18.422 --> 54:20.163
You know how at our traditional outlets,

54:20.257 --> 54:21.338
like Bergdorf's or Bloomingdale's,

54:21.425 --> 54:23.257
we have a dedicated makeup counter
with a specialist

54:23.343 --> 54:25.426
to help teach you about the products
and how to apply them.

54:25.512 --> 54:28.550
I thought what if, even at Target,
during our peak hours,

54:28.640 --> 54:31.178
we offer the same thing
to our diffusion line customers.

54:33.103 --> 54:34.093
Yeah.

54:34.605 --> 54:35.766
Oh, shit, you hate it.

54:36.565 --> 54:37.646
No, I don't hate it.

54:37.733 --> 54:39.565
No, if you think it's a shitty idea,
please tell me,

54:39.651 --> 54:41.608
'cause I am really freaking out
about this whole thing.

54:41.904 --> 54:44.237
From what I can gather,
just, you know, from my friends...

54:45.240 --> 54:48.608
those professionals at the makeup counters
are actually a deterrent.

54:49.244 --> 54:53.705
There's these, like, beautiful,
statuesque women just staring at you,

54:54.291 --> 54:57.250
with your pimples
and your asymmetrical face,

54:57.336 --> 54:59.077
and they just make you
feel bad about yourself.

55:00.088 --> 55:01.795
I mean, it makes them
feel bad about themselves.

55:01.882 --> 55:03.748
That's why these regular girls

55:03.842 --> 55:07.711
flock to the anonymous aisles
of a big superstore.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.671
So they can just go in
and buy their makeup

55:09.765 --> 55:12.007
without somebody standing there,

55:12.100 --> 55:14.683
making them just feel like
they aren't good enough.

55:14.770 --> 55:17.387
And... like it's a waste of time
to even try.

55:18.774 --> 55:20.265
I'm just a stupid idiot, dumb bitch.

55:20.526 --> 55:22.438
Oh, my God. You? No, you're not.

55:22.528 --> 55:23.894
You're, like, amazing.

55:24.530 --> 55:26.396
You're everything I could ever want to be.

55:27.658 --> 55:28.899
It's this voice.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.867
Your voice? You...

55:32.663 --> 55:34.746
Something wrong with your... your voice?

55:34.832 --> 55:36.198
I haven't noticed anything...

55:36.291 --> 55:37.577
It's a little high-pitched.

55:37.668 --> 55:39.250
I sound like a freaking moron.

55:39.336 --> 55:40.452
- No.
- But I'm not...

55:40.546 --> 55:42.412
I've got a JD/MBA from Wharton.

55:42.506 --> 55:44.418
I clerked for a Supreme Court Justice.

55:44.508 --> 55:45.715
But it's this voice, I can't kick it.

55:45.801 --> 55:47.508
I've tried everything. Vocal coaches...

55:49.555 --> 55:51.046
That's it, actually, just vocal coaches...

55:51.139 --> 55:53.472
- Coaches, okay.
- ...but still nothing.

55:53.892 --> 55:56.760
That's why I feel really lucky to have
someone like you here, Renee.

55:56.854 --> 55:58.311
Someone like me?

55:58.397 --> 56:00.559
Someone who knows
the clientele that we're going after,

56:00.649 --> 56:02.561
someone who can speak to that world.

56:03.068 --> 56:03.899
Yeah.

56:03.986 --> 56:06.273
There's a dinner coming up.
I'd love for you to come.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.150
A dinner? Oh, my gosh.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.106
You can bring your boyfriend or your...

56:11.368 --> 56:15.658
girlfriend, or however they identify,

56:15.747 --> 56:17.534
just... if you have one.

56:17.875 --> 56:19.411
No, I... uh...

56:19.501 --> 56:21.868
I guess I actually... I do have somebody

56:21.962 --> 56:24.329
that I could invite right now. Yeah.

56:24.423 --> 56:26.506
And he identifies as a guy.

56:27.092 --> 56:30.301
I mean, he's... there are some
very feminine aspects to him,

56:30.387 --> 56:33.221
but it's part of his charm. You'll see.

56:33.307 --> 56:34.639
Okay, good.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.444
- Hey.
- Hi.

56:48.530 --> 56:50.396
- Ready to get some dinner?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

56:50.490 --> 56:51.651
- All right, let's do it.
- Yeah.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.483
- Okay.
- Pretty hungry myself.

56:53.577 --> 56:54.818
Where you coming from?

56:54.912 --> 56:56.995
Oh, I was just, uh, down the street.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.742
Nowhere, hanging out.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.072
You're sweaty.

57:00.834 --> 57:02.700
Oh, I was working out, but I showered.

57:02.794 --> 57:03.784
- Okay.
- Yeah.

57:05.005 --> 57:06.212
Were you at Zumba?

57:07.466 --> 57:08.832
Zumba? Is that what it's called?

57:08.926 --> 57:10.883
I don't... I never pay attention.

57:10.969 --> 57:13.177
Yeah. Yeah, it's called Zumba.

57:13.263 --> 57:16.631
It's pretty... It's like a female workout.

57:16.725 --> 57:17.886
That's, like, a girl's...

57:19.227 --> 57:20.513
- Is it?
- Yes!

57:20.771 --> 57:22.854
I don't... It's a workout.

57:23.106 --> 57:24.267
- I don't go to gyms...
- Oh, my God.

57:24.358 --> 57:27.271
...'cause I don't like all the machismo,
so I go where the ladies go.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.394
- Oh, I get it.
- Not a big deal. Get what?

57:29.613 --> 57:30.694
You're that guy.

57:30.781 --> 57:32.693
"Go to the gym to pick up chicks" guy.

57:32.783 --> 57:36.367
I am 100% not the "go to the gym
to meet chicks" guy.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.867
- Really? Zumba?
- No, I am the guy who sits next to you

57:39.957 --> 57:42.540
for, like, four years in high school
and wants to ask you out,

57:42.626 --> 57:44.788
but I chicken out like I always do,

57:44.878 --> 57:47.996
and then I get online
and monitor your status for ten years,

57:48.090 --> 57:50.002
hoping that you'll be single
at the reunion,

57:50.092 --> 57:53.130
but if you're not, you're married,
that's... that's great, don't care.

57:53.220 --> 57:55.052
- You're happy for her?
- I'm happy for her.

57:55.722 --> 57:57.304
That's not real, by the way.
By the way, that's not real.

57:57.391 --> 57:58.381
That's me painting a picture.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.307
- That sounded pretty real.
- I mean...

58:01.269 --> 58:02.305
Let's go to dinner.

58:02.396 --> 58:04.103
When I started to say it, I regretted it.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.805
What was the...
What was the picture's name?

58:06.525 --> 58:07.481
Rachel.

58:13.573 --> 58:15.815
Yeah. You can have one grape.

58:17.411 --> 58:20.995
Where have you met the girls
you've mostly dated? You know?

58:21.748 --> 58:27.494
Uh, well, honestly,
I don't date that much.

58:28.088 --> 58:30.125
Well, that's really weird.

58:30.799 --> 58:31.755
- Is it?
- 'Cause neither do I.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.424
- What?
- No, I really don't.

58:33.510 --> 58:35.251
- I know it seems like...
- You're saying it 'cause I said it.

58:35.345 --> 58:37.211
No, it seems like I have
all this experience, I know,

58:37.305 --> 58:38.921
and that's kind of like
what I put out there,

58:39.016 --> 58:41.303
but I... I've dated...

58:42.477 --> 58:44.264
I've been in three relationships.

58:44.354 --> 58:45.310
- Really?
- Yeah,

58:45.397 --> 58:47.605
and one of them had a girlfriend.
I didn't know.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.353
I did not know. We were dating
for a couple months,

58:49.443 --> 58:51.309
and then I get
a phone call from this girl,

58:51.403 --> 58:53.190
like, "This is his girlfriend,"
I was like...

58:53.864 --> 58:55.321
- Oh, God.
- ..."This is his girlfriend."

58:55.407 --> 58:58.616
- Yeah.
- I would cry so hard.

58:58.702 --> 58:59.533
Did you cry?

59:00.245 --> 59:01.281
Don't answer that.

59:01.371 --> 59:02.862
- Don't answer that.
- Yes, I cried.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.697
- Why did I ask if you cried?
- No, you're a sensitive...

59:04.791 --> 59:06.783
Ah! That's not what a dude would ask.

59:06.877 --> 59:09.665
What about... Is that...
Is that your class over there?

59:09.755 --> 59:11.291
- Do you want to... No...
- Okay.

59:11.548 --> 59:13.585
I'm strictly indoor Zumba.

59:13.675 --> 59:15.086
I would never do outdoor Zumba.

59:15.177 --> 59:16.839
What's the move
they're doing right now called?

59:16.928 --> 59:18.464
That's called the star hop.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.717
It's not a full jump.

59:21.850 --> 59:22.931
You are...

59:23.393 --> 59:25.180
You are quite a man, Ethan.

59:27.439 --> 59:28.975
I got to read more <i>Maxim</i> or something.

59:29.066 --> 59:31.649
Ew, please don't read <i>Maxim.</i>
You're perfect.

59:31.735 --> 59:33.192
I'm not perfect,

59:33.278 --> 59:36.897
but I... do think that you are.

59:38.575 --> 59:39.656
Whatever, Wheat Thin.

59:39.743 --> 59:40.824
I'm being serious.

59:42.079 --> 59:43.615
You're, like, so yourself...

59:44.956 --> 59:46.743
or something, I don't know, it's cool.

59:46.833 --> 59:49.200
No, keep talking.

59:50.170 --> 59:53.754
Uh, I think a lot of people
are confused about themselves.

59:54.341 --> 59:58.676
They, like, obsess over
whatever negative quality

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.175
they perceive in themselves
and they completely miss

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:04.302
the thing that really makes them awesome.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:08.348
You, like, know who you are

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:11.272
and you don't really care
how the world sees you.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.939
You're... so yourself, too.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:19.022
I mean, you have no idea
who you are.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.073
No, but you're honest about it.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.825
And it just makes me feel really...

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.784
I don't know, like, close to you.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.115
Are you going to kiss me?

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.243
I was just gonna

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.454
- get as close as I could...
- Uh-huh.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.794
- ...to tell you...
- Yeah?

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:38.378
...that I...

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:39.504
You have a girlfriend?

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.460
...would love to kiss you.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.475
Just give me one minute.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.808
Yeah, no worries, take your time.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.654
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey...

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:04.608
Wow.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:08.412
I thought you might want
a sneak peek of what's to come.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.912
I don't know if you know
what "sneak peek" means.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.834
You're completely naked.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:16.663
Oh, how embarrassing.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.335
Do you want me to go cover up?

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.631
No.

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:21.668
No?

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:23.093
No.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.011
Cool.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.095
Okay.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.846
- Ethan, are you coming?
- Yup.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.650
Hi.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:48.570
Thanks for coming over.

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:13.390
- Um...
- What?

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:19.063
Yeah, I... I want you to see me. You know?

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:20.484
Oh, yeah, no, 100%.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.062
I'm definitely loving seeing you.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:28.990
I just didn't know if you...
wanted to see me.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.404
No, I want to see you.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:32.826
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.580
Oh, my God.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:37.911
Oh...

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.085
Oh, my God!

01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:45.710
Are you looking in the mirror?

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.087
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:52.516
Oh, that is so hot.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.016
It felt good the whole time.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.518
- The whole time?
- The whole time.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.770
- That was my favorite part.
- This is perfect.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:02.852
I liked the whole time.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:05.654
Yeah, and you were such a great leader.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.072
You really took over.

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:11.535
Thank you, and you follow the leader well.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.987
I was willing to do...

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.288
Wait, shh... Do you hear that?

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.495
- What is it?
- Is that the ice cream man?

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.121
I think that's the ice cream man.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:22.875
Oh, no, it's just an ambulance.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.800
Renee, you're just naked at the window.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.468
Everybody down there can see you.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:30.464
Well, they're welcome.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:34.804
- It's a good neighborhood.
- Uh... How...

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.560
How do you do that?

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.063
Do what?

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:41.892
I don't know, have all of the confidence?

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:43.817
I wasn't always like that.

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:45.269
And what changed?

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:49.277
I started to really believe that...

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:53.570
if I wanted it bad enough,
all my dreams could come true.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.121
And they are. You know?

01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:57.906
Yeah.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.085
- Okay, that...
- That is the ice cream man.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.583
That might be the ice cream man. Yeah.

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:15.516
All right, follow me right this way.

01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:17.343
Your guests are
in the private dining room.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.433
Private dining room?

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:21.730
Mmm.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.401
It must be a company-wide thing,
or I wouldn't have been invited.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.939
O-kay.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.274
- What the...
- Sorry.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:38.122
That's a very small company.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.324
So, how did you two meet?

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:44.207
Uh, we actually met at the dry cleaners.

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.965
Yeah. I had vomited sangria,
like, all over a sweater.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:48.962
It was pretty romantic.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.964
- Sounds magical.
- Yeah.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:54.297
So, Renee, I was just
telling Gram here about

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.553
all of our great ideas
for the diffusion line.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.059
- Hmm.
- Cool. Yeah.

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:00.518
Great ideas.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.939
Yeah, oh, they're so great.

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:05.648
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.317
Wow, you're really nailing this, Avery.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:08.986
Avery, relax, dear.

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.866
Renee, Avery obviously wants you here

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:16.660
in order to legitimize
her whole plan for the line.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:17.577
Gram.

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:19.872
I mean, Avery has been incredible.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.450
I still can't believe
I even get to work with her.

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:24.417
Oh, my God. Is that Hidden Valley?

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:25.874
Only the best, my dear.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:28.047
Oh, my God, that is my absolute favorite.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:30.170
In high school,
I would just eat it by the spoonful.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:32.293
And by spoonful,
I mean I would just chug it.

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:35.630
You know, KFC actually uses HV.

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:38.932
But nobody knows, because
they put it in their KFC packaging.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:40.850
Do you want me to grab you some,
next time I'm in there?

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.053
A couple of the small packets?

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:45.431
That's the nicest offer
I've had in a long time.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.016
Surely.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.942
Well, you know,
collecting travel-sized condiments

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:51.771
is, like, a very big part of my life.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:52.901
The tiny little ketchup bottles?

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:55.483
Or the little Tabascos? They slay me!

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:58.194
- So, as I was saying, Renee...
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:02.373
...has been instrumental
in helping refine our message.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:03.620
Uh-huh.

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:06.376
And just what is that message?

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:07.624
Well...

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:11.708
Just that I think that most
luxury brands get it so wrong

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.417
when they try to make a diffusion line.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:17.004
They treat it more aspirational,
when it really needs to be...

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:19.886
- Functional.
- And practical and real.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:20.966
I mean, these women,

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.642
they know who they are, and they just...

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:24.557
They're proud to be bargain hunters.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:27.731
Avery's life experience may not allow her

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.977
to connect with that customer.

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.317
Please tell me you're going
to be in Boston with us.

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:36.232
Yes, of course. She is.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:37.816
Of course I am?

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:39.743
Yes, of course. Remember?

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:40.910
You never mentioned that to me.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.614
Yeah, we definitely had
this conversation about you...

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:44.994
Avery, we definitely didn't.
I would remember...

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:46.245
- ...Boston...
- That would be, like,

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.918
- a very big deal to me.
- Don't you remember?

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.246
I would have called you.
I would have called, like, everybody.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.672
I... Is your eye okay?

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:54.668
Oh, my God, would you
please just agree to go?

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.841
Before her fake eyelashes
come flying off her bulging eyes.

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:00.343
Stop that.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:05.933
Would you come with us to Boston
for the Target pitch?

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.730
Oh, hell, yeah, Gram. I will be in Boston!

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:09.852
Of course I'll go!

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.185
Does the Pope shit in Boston? I'm going.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.399
This is definitely where
my work friends said they'd be.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:19.946
Why are we running?

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:23.746
It's like a super exclusive speakeasy,
with, like, a hot crowd.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:32.121
Hi. Um, we're here for the speakeasy.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.380
What speakeasy?

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:36.501
Uh...

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:39.178
Three girls for the speakeasy.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:42.218
- No.
- Am I saying that right?

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:43.344
- Speakeasy...
- It's cool. We'll find it.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:44.675
- Thanks, dude.
- Speak...

01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:47.803
He was supposed to just show us
where the doorway was. Right?

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.308
- That's clear.
- Right.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.473
I don't understand. And now,

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.309
look, he's leading these girls to it.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.233
Ew! Those posers don't know
what they're missing out here.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.029
Didn't I ask you guys to wear heels?

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.441
Yeah, well, I can't walk in heels. So...

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:02.572
I'm just saying that if we want
to get into places like this...

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:05.075
We don't really care about
getting into places like that.

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:06.621
But I guess now you do?

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.916
Jenn! Hi! Oh, my God!

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:13.791
- Oh! Hello.
- Hello, sir.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:17.420
Um,
can I get one of all of those?

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:18.758
Thank you.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.260
Okay, good news, bad news.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:23.010
Um, good news is that I can get in.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.715
Bad news is you guys can't.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.676
So, you know, obviously
I'm going to stay with you guys.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.433
I want to be here and not in there,

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.140
in some dumb club
with these girls I barely know.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:34.314
Yeah...

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:36.189
Unless that's what you guys
think I should do 'cause...

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.111
- Yeah...
- Yeah? Are you sure?

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:40.609
Okay. Okay, thank you so much,
you guys. Okay.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.692
I will tell you guys
absolutely everything tomorrow.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:43.901
Enjoy the food.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.694
Okay, is there where it is?

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:49.448
- In here?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:56.872
And then what I realized
is that I could eat whatever I want

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.707
and still look like this.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.792
Shout out to my genetic makeup.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.094
So blessed.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:11.470
We'll be with you momentarily.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:14.393
Hello, Lily LeClaire, you've got Renee.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:16.691
- Hi.
- Hi. One second.

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.395
- Yeah. I love hearing your voice, too.
- I have an appointment...

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.197
East Coast Escrow is on the second floor.
You're gonna wanna head down there.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.366
I'm sorry, can you just...
if you could scoot just a little bit.

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:27.819
Welcome to Lily LeClaire.
I am living for your bag.

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:28.904
Thanks!

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.251
Oh, my God, you're waiting for me. Hi.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:43.586
Hi.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.671
Thank you so much for still doing this.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.176
Oh, my God, stop it.

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:48.928
I wouldn't miss our first Grouper date.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.055
I know, but you know, Ethan and...

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.727
Hey, I want to do this.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:53.933
- Okay. Yes.
- All right.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.855
I'm going to be, like,
the ultimate wing woman.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:58.400
And when they pay attention to me,
I'll just redirect them to you.

01:09:58.486 --> 01:09:59.317
- Oh.
- That's my whole plan.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:00.611
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.187
Okay.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:04.193
There's... Okay.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.615
- Hey, y'all. I am Renee.
- Hey.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.788
- Hey.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.739
- Nice to meet you.
- You guys,

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:13.870
what are we talking about?

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.326
Renee, where are you from?

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:16.744
Oh.

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.787
No, I see what's happening here.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:22.420
No, redirect that energy all over here.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:24.422
Not all over her face,

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:26.424
but you and I are not going to happen.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.592
Lyle, I like your scarf.

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:31.471
Oh, really, this little thing.
You don't think it's too much?

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:35.646
Is it hand-knit?
'Cause I actually do some loom weaving.

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:37.309
I don't know how to make a scarf,

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.642
but once I made
a Native American medicine bag.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.820
Actually, my sister studies
18th-century textiles online.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:46.239
Actually, a little bit about Viv
that's unexpected.

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:50.660
She was thrown out of eighth grade
for showing everybody her boobies.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:51.703
We all have a past.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.246
And look, don't sleep on Jane.

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:56.871
Yes, she's dressed like an old man
watering his lawn, it doesn't matter.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:58.577
Because once she gets
out of these clothes,

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.003
she has a sick body.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.081
I can tell you guys
have a lot of sexual energy.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:04.007
You know what, I feel like we could use
some more drinks.

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.254
- The ladies will be right back.
- Yeah.

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:07.051
Okay. You guys get a drink,
and I'll hang with the boys.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:08.128
No, no. You're coming with. Come on. No.

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:09.212
Okay.

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:12.262
- Hey.
- What are you doing to us?

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.764
I'm trying to help you guys, you serious?

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:16.971
- What?
- I'm setting you up for success.

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:18.271
Just be hotter.

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:20.440
You got to lead with your hotness.

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:23.110
And then let them find out
how boring you are later.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:24.945
You think we're boring?

01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:28.524
Let's start over, okay?
You guys are going to be fun.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:29.779
Let's have a blast.

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:31.986
I'm feeling like shots.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.782
You guys want shots?

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:35.705
You guys are crazy.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.200
Oh, hi. Hi, how are you?

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:39.876
Can we have six shots of Fireball?

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.624
All right.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:44.339
Oh, my God. Obsessed with me.

01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:46.000
Is he staring?

01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:46.958
- No.
- Yeah.

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:49.761
We always dance together like crazy.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:51.259
Back it up!

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.136
- Not to me.
- Please, don't do that to her.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.154
Renee.

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:17.739
Can I sit here?

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:22.294
I'm a slightly nervous flier,
so I took a few things.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:23.837
Oh, cool.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:26.006
Okay, yeah.

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:27.632
This is absolutely nuts.

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:30.085
I am bugging,
I am bugging right out, right now.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.387
Well, if things go
like I expect they will,

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:34.931
we have a lot more trips
like this in our future.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.927
What are you talking about?
Like vacays to the Maldives?

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.770
No, I was thinking more like Akron

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:43.600
or Milwaukee, where we have our factories.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:47.312
Okay. Okay. I thought we were going
a different way with it, but cool.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:49.689
Oh, I also want to give you a title.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.148
Something like...

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.700
VP of diffusion line, if you like that?

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:57.787
Okay. I have a title?
VP of the diffusion line!

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:01.120
Wait, should I get, like, a standing desk
or something? Is that too fancy?

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.668
No, those people always look like
they work at Verizon, but I don't know.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.749
Are you sure you don't want
to sit near the snacks?

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.956
I don't want to hog them.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.506
There's just, like, so many.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.792
So, let's talk about the keynote speech.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.628
So I put the whole thing on my tablet.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:15.305
I can hook up to a Bluetooth,
or I can just be on a remote.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.381
I can go to a flat screen...

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:17.890
Shh...

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.811
- Okay.
- You'll be great...

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.184
I'm just going to be quiet.

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.067
Come up there? Okay.

01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:37.277
Hi.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:39.154
She see me?

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.073
- Avery?
- Yeah.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.333
No. It's an hour flight.

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:45.001
Word will probably get out.

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.875
Yeah, but once we're
up in the air, it's too late.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:49.919
I didn't know you were coming.

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:52.001
Oh, yeah, I'm just hitching a ride
to the Yankees-Red Sox game.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.131
So cool.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.054
Are you pleasantly surprised?

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:57.631
- That you're coming?
- Yeah.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:13:59.428
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:00.850
Good. Me, too.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:03.224
<i>Good morning, welcome aboard.
This is Dan, your captain speaking.</i>

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.931
<i>About 35 minutes up to Boston,
skies are clear.</i>

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:08.017
<i>Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.</i>

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:13.610
"What we really wanna say
to our customer is that, yes,

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:18.277
we have made these items
cheaper for her and easier to use.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.446
But really...

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.951
But really what
we've made them is better...

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:29.755
...is better for her.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:35.086
Because we love her."

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:36.928
No, thank you.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.219
"Because we love her..."

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:44.557
Oh.

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.225
Hey.

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:47.727
Hi.

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:50.024
So, I'm... I'm right next door.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:52.854
That's crazy.

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:54.563
Do you mind if I come in
and make a quick phone call?

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.366
Is that okay? Great, thanks.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.783
- Yeah, the phone is...
- Right here?

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.493
The phone... Yeah.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.539
Hey, yeah, can I get the steelhead salmon?

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.336
And you can leave off the gremolata,

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:17.761
and the tartlet of leek and chanterelles.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:20.134
- You want anything?
- Oh, no. I'm fine.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:21.506
Mozzarella sticks?

01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:25.469
- Mozzarella sticks.
- Mozzarella sticks, okay.

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:27.099
If you want them, I don't even like them.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.101
- But if you like them...
- No, I want them.

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:31.683
And a couple of orders
of, uh, mozzarella sticks.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.401
Right. Thanks.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:37.986
- Why can't you order?
- Yeah. So, um,

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:41.034
Avery had all the room charges
blocked from my room.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.241
Hey, it's not funny.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.369
See, if I'd known
she was going to do that,

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:50.453
I would have just, uh, asked
to room with you from the beginning.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:52.628
Huh.

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:54.422
Right.

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:58.715
This is cute. These pigtails.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:00.299
Yeah.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:01.880
Don't see them so much these days.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.557
Yeah, two of them.

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:06.384
Yeah, saw the other one around there.

01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:07.469
Yeah.

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.221
It's nice.

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:11.644
Thanks.

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.901
So, they got you the big suite, huh?

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.111
Yeah.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:18.814
This is, like, twice the size of my room.

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:21.066
It's bigger than my apartment.

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:22.859
God, look at the size of this bed.

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:25.991
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's...

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.244
- I'll just put this there.
- ...a bandage for my leg.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:30.496
Um...

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:34.371
I'm supposed to go
meet your sister at the bar

01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:36.252
to go over the presentation.

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.545
I'll just leave as soon
as the food comes, then.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:40.877
Wow.

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:44.009
Looks like you're totally prepared
for this meeting tomorrow.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.056
Yeah.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:47.759
I mean, I'm sure you'll just
dazzle them, as per usual.

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:50.603
I dazzle?

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.181
Please, like you don't know.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.519
Come on, you dazzle my sister,
my grandma... me.

01:16:58.823 --> 01:16:59.779
What?

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:01.110
Come here, sit down.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:07.822
I don't know how you do it, Renee, but...

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:13.619
you've gotten a whole lot of women
who always think they know best

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:17.046
to sit up and take notice of you.

01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:22.465
And what you think, and who you are.

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:26.097
Me?

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.760
Yeah, I can't even get
my room charges covered.

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:35.478
Yeah, but a lot of women notice you, too.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:40.028
Maybe, but that's just 'cause
of my family's money.

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:41.692
Uh...

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:42.818
I think.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.232
Yeah, no.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.282
Maybe not?

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:46.359
No.

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:51.080
Problem is, I never really know, you know?

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:52.908
No, I don't.

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.535
Except, you know, with you...

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.339
I feel like I actually do know.

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:02.917
That I'm gunning for your money?

01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:05.345
Every last cent of it.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.853
Oh...

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:22.775
Uh...

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:24.731
I am wet...

01:18:24.825 --> 01:18:25.986
Excuse me?

01:18:26.076 --> 01:18:28.443
...with diarrhea.

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:31.120
- Oh.
- Yeah, I...

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:35.121
I need you to go, 'cause I just feel
how much I'm getting diarrhea.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.247
Okay.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:39.205
And I don't want you to see the diarrhea.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:00.316
Who are you?

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:03.604
Who are you?

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:06.110
Hey, Renee, the food's here.
I guess I'll head off.

01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:53.115
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.378
Renee, whoa, are you okay?

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:04.039
Yeah, never better.

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:05.669
I'm looking for Avery LeClaire.

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:07.842
I'm supposed to meet her down here,
but I'm really late.

01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:08.964
Have you seen her?

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:11.258
You've got blood spurting out
of your head.

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.012
Oh, yeah, it really hurts.
What are you doing here?

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.638
I'm just getting ready
for the Target pitch tomorrow.

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:17.936
They want me to do some AV stuff.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:20.139
Wait a minute. You recognize me?

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:21.222
Yeah.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.149
You recognize me right now, no problem?

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:25.318
Yeah, I mean, the blood
threw me a little, but...

01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:26.895
Oh, my God, I knew I felt different.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:30.316
Oh, my God. Please let it not be gone.

01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:34.577
Please, God. Please, please, please.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:44.830
No, no, no.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:46.752
No!

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.799
It's gone! It's gone!

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:54.180
I said... I said, "Who are you?"
into the foggy mirror,

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.723
and I hit my head.

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:58.218
I must've broken the spell,

01:20:58.312 --> 01:20:59.598
and it's gone!

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.607
I knew it. I knew it couldn't last!

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:08.437
Why would this last?
You're so stupid, Renee!

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:10.025
What's wrong with you?

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.736
I'm back to being me!

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:25.249
Okay.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:28.377
I need you to give this to Avery LeClaire.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.922
It has everything she needs
for the presentation.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:34.133
She's going to think
she can't do it, but she can.

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.384
Why? Aren't you going to do it?

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:37.807
I wish I could be there, but I can't.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:39.054
Will you tell her?

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:40.726
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:21:58.247 --> 01:22:03.288
<i>Flight 1116 to New York
is now boarding at gate C-17.</i>

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.950
Oh, no.

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.791
<i>Renee, I did the pitch.</i>

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:50.213
<i>I did it just like you said,</i>

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:53.087
<i>but coming from me,
it just didn't sound right.</i>

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.384
<i>Now we're doing this giant launch event</i>

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:57.053
<i>to show everyone how great the line is,</i>

01:22:57.139 --> 01:23:00.303
<i>and we need you. Call me!</i>

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:06.304
<i>Hey, you're home!</i>

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.139
<i>Oh, shit, hello?</i>

01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:11.438
- Um...
<i>- Are you okay? What just happened?</i>

01:23:11.528 --> 01:23:12.735
Uh... I...

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:13.811
Oh, God.

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:17.073
My back. I broke it.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:18.240
<i>Just now?</i>

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:19.693
No, no, no. Um...

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:22.870
At the airplane.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:24.664
<i>Well, that sucks.</i>

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.286
<i>What if I come over and take care of you?</i>

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:27.913
No, no, no, no.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:31.337
<i>- Okay...</i>
- They're spraying for ants.

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:33.585
<i>Oh, well, then, Renee,
you shouldn't be there anyway.</i>

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:36.088
<i>That's horrible. That's, like,
poison stuff. I'll come get you.</i>

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:40.513
No, I really want to be here
for the ant removal.

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:43.091
I don't want them
to remove the ones I like.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:46.344
And I don't really look
my best right now. So I...

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.849
<i>Obviously, I don't believe that.</i>

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.647
<i>I think you look great all the time.</i>

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:52.271
<i>How about this?
Saturday night, I'll take you out.</i>

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.190
<i>You're probably gonna be
recovered by then, right?</i>

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:55.854
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.112
<i>Okay. I miss you.</i>

01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:58.690
I miss you, too.

01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:07.328
<i>Oh, it seems like
you're standing right there.</i>

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:09.500
<i>- Is your back all right now?</i>
- No.

01:24:09.586 --> 01:24:11.168
<i>It looked like you had gotten...</i>

01:24:11.255 --> 01:24:12.871
Yeah, no, that's a coincidence
'cause I'm not up.

01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:14.297
<i>Don't rush this, if you...</i>

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:25.140
Darling, if all you have
is a pack of gum, please.

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:31.978
Wait! Why her? What about me?
I'm standing right here.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.059
All I have is this cookie.

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.314
Is it because she's so beautiful?

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:39.276
- I didn't even see you in line.
- Yeah, right.

01:24:39.366 --> 01:24:41.449
You probably have all these
cookies at your house

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:43.948
from all the 20-year-olds that you bang!

01:24:44.037 --> 01:24:45.619
And you don't even deserve it!

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:49.074
They just want your money,
so now you know that.

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:50.745
- Hi, darling.
- Hi, honey.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:53.040
I found the ginkgo biloba.

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:54.583
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:56.505
I would like to apologize.

01:24:57.175 --> 01:25:00.919
I did not know your situation,
and it's very beautiful.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:04.847
You are two beautiful aging white men.

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:06.094
Thank you.

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:27.244
I know, it's all gone.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.747
I brought you these cookies.

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:31.620
They're covered in chocolate.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:33.622
Okay, you're so drunk.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.796
And there's a picture of a cat on safari.

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:40.546
I know you just assume you can just
drop by whenever you want

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:43.344
because your loser friends have no plans.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:46.173
But we're about to go to Escape the Room.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.718
It's the Grouper guys.
Hey, Groupers!

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:52.269
- Don't call them that.
- Where's your scarf at?

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:56.141
I want to go to the room
you pay to be locked in.

01:25:56.610 --> 01:26:01.150
I don't really feel like being embarrassed
or insulted tonight, so no.

01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:04.023
You don't want to go with me
because I'm not pretty anymore.

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:06.655
Look, why do you think
everyone cares what you look like?

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:13.496
Like, we're your friends
because you were fun and funny and kind.

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:15.501
And then I don't know what happened.

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:17.544
I could tell you what happened.

01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:21.757
All my wildest dreams came true,
and then it was gone.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.709
Renee, will you just listen to yourself?

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:26.296
Your wildest dream
is that you were beautiful?

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.847
That is so sad!

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:31.017
Yeah, like, we never gave a shit
what you looked like.

01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:34.767
Guys, I just want us to go back
to how we were before.

01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:37.812
Can't we just do that?
Can't we just go back?

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:40.689
No. And we have to go, so...

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:43.192
All of us? We all can go?

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:44.192
No.

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:45.773
Just us and not the guys?

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:47.608
Absolutely not.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:50.744
Okay. Okay, I understand.

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:55.534
Well, I have my cell phone on
if anybody changes their mind.

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.059
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.207
Whoa!

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:45.667
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:47.961
- You okay?
- Sorry.

01:27:56.897 --> 01:27:58.229
Sorry, sorry.

01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:00.060
What am I even worried about?

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.732
There's no way he's going to recognize me.

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.449
Are you here alone?

01:28:58.416 --> 01:28:59.748
No. Y...

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:01.663
Uh, yes.

01:29:02.045 --> 01:29:06.585
Technically, but, um,
I'm meeting my boyfriend.

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.257
Oh, right. Okay.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:09.671
Of course.

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:16.099
Well, how about I buy you
a drink while you wait?

01:29:16.852 --> 01:29:18.343
No, I really shouldn't.

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.599
Well, why not?

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:24.766
Just killin' time,
you're waitin' for your boyfriend.

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.522
I'm waitin' for my girlfriend.

01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:28.895
Your girlfriend?

01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:33.441
Did you say that she's your girlfriend?

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.736
I did say that.

01:29:37.289 --> 01:29:40.282
And I hope that's okay.

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:42.537
No, I'm sure she, like, loves it.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:44.952
But what, um...

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.662
What's she like? Like...

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.875
Your girlfriend... That's your girlfriend?

01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:55.172
She is pretty amazing.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:59.058
Funny and smart.

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:02.596
And the most beautiful girl in the world.

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:05.231
And here I am, "How did I get this lady?"

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:07.517
And I did.

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:12.988
I can't...

01:30:14.284 --> 01:30:16.742
I can't... Excuse me.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:25.496
- Hey.
- Hey, um...

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:28.705
I'm sorry. I am not going
to be able to make it tonight.

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.206
<i>Um...</i>

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:33.425
I can't do this.

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:35.173
I don't know what we're doing.

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:39.177
You, me, any of it.
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:41.346
Okay, wait. Hold on.

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:44.144
I didn't mean to freak you out, I'm sorry.

01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:46.096
I really thought we were just having fun.

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:49.730
No, we were having fun.
That's not it. Um...

01:30:51.071 --> 01:30:52.778
Um... I, uh...

01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:56.274
I don't know what to say to you.

01:30:58.453 --> 01:30:59.534
It's over.

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:01.988
Well, look, you don't have to... Don't.
Let's not do it over the phone.

01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:03.869
Wherever you are, I'll come and meet you,

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:05.871
<i>- and let's talk.</i>
- No, no, no.

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:08.078
<i>- You can't come where I am.</i>
- Why?

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:09.958
You can't see me anymore.

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:13.044
<i>I'm not who you think I am.</i>

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:14.591
And that's it? I think I...

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:17.382
I think I deserve better than that.

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:19.471
You deserve much better than this.

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:21.389
You deserve much better than me.

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:24.014
I'm sorry.

01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:22.659
- Hey...
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:24.908
Hi. Hi, it's me.

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:27.081
- I know, yeah.
- I really need bike 34.

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:28.374
Oh, um...

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.624
I need to recreate the magic
of that last class.

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:34.251
Oh. We would like it
if you don't recreate that.

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:37.424
I'll be fine. I just...
I really, really need it.

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:39.126
Okay. There.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.133
What's up, SoHo, you ready?

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:44.590
This is your ride! This is your time!

01:32:44.684 --> 01:32:47.142
Knees inside your pelvis, core engaged!

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:49.811
I want you to set an intention
for this ride!

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:50.763
I got one!

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:54.692
If your intention was for change,
the change is already here,

01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:57.395
- and the miracle is already here.
- Yes, it is!

01:32:57.489 --> 01:33:01.278
Today you're going to see that person
that you've always wanted to be!

01:33:01.367 --> 01:33:04.360
Change your mind! Change your body!

01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:05.945
Change your life!

01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:07.913
Are you ready?

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:09.323
Yeah!

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.955
Here we go! In three, two, one! Up!

01:33:37.904 --> 01:33:39.270
Oh, God.

01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:47.953
- Hey.
- Oh.

01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:49.155
You okay?

01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:52.166
Yeah. I just, um... Sorry.

01:33:52.919 --> 01:33:55.161
I'm just going through
a rough breakup, so...

01:33:55.255 --> 01:33:58.714
Well, I bet guys can be pretty mean

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.041
when you break up with them, right?

01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:03.754
Or when they break up with you
for being a real freaking person.

01:34:04.055 --> 01:34:06.138
Wait, hang on.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.223
The acoustics in here are weird.

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:10.426
It sounds like you are saying
you got dumped.

01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:15.727
Someone said to you,
"I don't want to see you anymore.

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:18.442
Ever again. I don't want
to have sex with you again."

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.903
Somebody has told you... You got dumped?

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:23.197
- Can you stop saying "dumped"?
- Of course, I'm sorry.

01:34:23.283 --> 01:34:25.149
I... I just assumed that...

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:28.073
you wouldn't have
to deal with stuff like that.

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:31.122
What? 'Cause of my body.
Or something like...

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.164
Your body, your whole head.

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:37.245
Do you have every rib that I have?

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:40.001
Everything really worked out for you.

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.420
Where even are your organs?

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:46.550
I've always dealt with being
really insecure, so it's nice to hear.

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:49.928
Shut up, forever. What?

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:51.475
No, I'm serious. Like, it's an issue.

01:34:51.561 --> 01:34:53.268
I, like, struggle with self-esteem. So...

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:56.597
I want to punch you right
in your dumb face right now.

01:34:56.691 --> 01:35:00.025
Okay, that's the kind of comment
that, like... I just...

01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:01.727
That's what causes my insecurity.

01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:03.278
"Dumb." It's like...
It's like a trigger word.

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:04.775
I'm sorry I said that, it's just...

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:08.610
You getting dumped is making me feel
like I might be okay.

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:10.444
Randomly, it's making me feel better, too.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.872
- Okay, that's good.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:15.745
But, um, I have to actually go.

01:35:15.835 --> 01:35:17.918
I have a go-see at Lily LeClaire.

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:19.871
Lily LeClaire?

01:35:19.964 --> 01:35:21.125
- Yeah.
- For what?

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:23.583
Um, like, modeling a new line, I guess.

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:25.216
The diffusion line?

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.756
- Um...
- Wait, you're going for that?

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:28.587
- It's...
- Yeah.

01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:31.298
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye. Feel better.

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:33.008
- Thanks.
- That guy's a dick.

01:35:33.102 --> 01:35:34.263
Yeah.

01:35:44.113 --> 01:35:45.979
- Morning.
- Hi.

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:47.861
It's 3:00 p.m.

01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:49.574
What you got for me?

01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:52.028
- In terms of what?
- Packages.

01:35:52.914 --> 01:35:55.497
- Some of those for me?
- Uh, no, those are empty.

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:57.745
Can I have an ionic water? Bottom right.

01:35:59.963 --> 01:36:03.081
Thanks. Uh, you should really serve these
with a straw and a napkin.

01:36:03.174 --> 01:36:04.881
But I won't hold it against you.

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:07.335
Hey, do you know if this is something
to do with the diffusion line?

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:10.762
Yeah, they're casting
the face of the line.

01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:12.760
God!

01:36:12.850 --> 01:36:15.058
They're planning a huge party
to launch the whole thing.

01:36:15.144 --> 01:36:16.180
Yeah.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:18.103
You think it ever occurred
to them to cast someone

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:20.681
who looks like they would
actually buy the products?

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:22.107
Someone like you?

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:26.774
Yeah.

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.276
Yes.

01:36:28.825 --> 01:36:30.532
Someone exactly like me.

01:36:31.577 --> 01:36:33.443
Hey, Viv. Um...

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:35.992
I've been looking everywhere
for you guys. I...

01:36:36.916 --> 01:36:39.909
I just want to apologize
for how I behaved. I'm so sorry.

01:36:40.003 --> 01:36:42.541
I... I'm so embarrassed.

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.963
Please tell Jane, I...

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:47.750
Anyway, um...

01:36:48.594 --> 01:36:51.382
I really want you to
meet up with me on Friday.

01:36:52.557 --> 01:36:54.674
I... I need you.

01:36:56.311 --> 01:36:58.018
Okay. This is Renee.

01:36:58.604 --> 01:36:59.594
Okay.

01:37:10.992 --> 01:37:12.278
Come on! We're going to miss it.

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:14.200
- This is uphill!
- This is it.

01:37:14.287 --> 01:37:15.403
This is the door.

01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:21.162
- Close it. Close it.
- I am.

01:37:21.252 --> 01:37:22.709
Don't yell at me. I'm closing it.

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:26.167
Act like you've been here before.
Act like you work here.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:28.420
I can't lose my job, all right?

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:31.047
I'll have to move back with my aunt.
She calls me Meat Patty.

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:32.344
- She drinks too much.
- I know.

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:34.092
Why didn't I hear about this
when we worked together?

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:35.718
This would be fun banter.

01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:37.720
- Yeah.
- Okay. Just keep it cool.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:56.284
Good evening.

01:37:58.831 --> 01:38:00.868
And thank you all for coming tonight.

01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:03.333
<i>We're so pleased to have you here.</i>

01:38:05.046 --> 01:38:10.041
This is an exciting evening
for Lily LeClaire, for you, and for me.

01:38:10.676 --> 01:38:13.544
When my grandmother
first started this company...

01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:16.714
in the year 1200 AD...

01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:18.928
It's a long, long time ago.

01:38:21.771 --> 01:38:25.606
She had only $1,000.

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:27.979
Again, that was a long time ago...

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:32.608
Inflation, so...

01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:36.362
So that would be different now. And...

01:38:39.539 --> 01:38:41.326
That wasn't supposed to happen. Uh...

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:42.865
What... What?

01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:45.538
Could somebody... Is there anybody here...

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:46.709
Technical support?

01:38:46.796 --> 01:38:50.756
Anybody who's technical or support?

01:38:51.217 --> 01:38:53.425
Stupid bitch, you're such a failure.

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:25.999
I thought that was going to bust easier.

01:39:27.336 --> 01:39:28.292
Um...

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.211
Hello.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.127
My name is Renee.

01:39:32.467 --> 01:39:33.457
And, uh...

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:37.131
Some of you know me as this woman.

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.130
Glamorous.

01:39:41.184 --> 01:39:42.140
Flawless.

01:39:42.852 --> 01:39:43.683
Perfection.

01:39:44.562 --> 01:39:45.928
But that's not the real me.

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:50.148
This is the real me.

01:39:50.485 --> 01:39:51.601
I don't get it.

01:39:52.153 --> 01:39:55.521
I know, these women look nothing alike.

01:39:56.616 --> 01:39:57.697
But they're both me.

01:39:58.242 --> 01:40:00.029
Take a second to process it.

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:04.113
But in this industry,
I only felt wanted...

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:06.957
when I looked like this.

01:40:09.337 --> 01:40:11.499
- I think she's crazy.
- Not when I looked...

01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:29.225
There was no magic.

01:40:31.192 --> 01:40:32.353
That's me.

01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:34.897
That's me, they're both me. That's me.

01:40:47.083 --> 01:40:48.665
I did all this as me.

01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:58.876
When we're little girls,

01:41:00.263 --> 01:41:02.596
we have all the confidence in the world.

01:41:04.767 --> 01:41:07.134
We let our bellies hang out, and...

01:41:08.104 --> 01:41:10.721
And we just dance and play

01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:12.272
and pick our wedgies.

01:41:13.818 --> 01:41:15.650
And then these things happen that just...

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:17.318
They make us question ourselves.

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:20.238
Somebody says something mean
to you on the playground,

01:41:20.992 --> 01:41:22.153
and then we grow up,

01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:25.281
and you doubt yourself
over and over again until...

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:27.996
you lose all that confidence.

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:31.541
All that self-esteem, all that faith
you started with is gone.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.082
But what if we didn't
let those moments get to us?

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.456
What if we were stronger than that?

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:40.463
Right?

01:41:41.012 --> 01:41:43.004
What if we didn't care
about how we looked?

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:45.597
Or how we sounded?

01:41:48.394 --> 01:41:51.387
What if we never lost
that little-girl confidence?

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:53.305
What if when someone tells us

01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:56.813
that we aren't good
or thin or pretty enough,

01:41:57.612 --> 01:41:59.729
we have strength and the wisdom...

01:42:01.324 --> 01:42:03.941
to say what I am is better
than all of that?

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:08.741
Because what I am is me!

01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:12.658
I'm me!

01:42:13.169 --> 01:42:14.705
And I'm proud to be me!

01:42:15.254 --> 01:42:18.793
And if you ever get the chance
to hang out with me or my friends,

01:42:19.216 --> 01:42:22.380
my amazing, perfect friends...

01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:24.962
Well, all I have to say to you
is you're welcome.

01:42:28.225 --> 01:42:30.137
Mason, hit it.

01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:34.270
We are real women.

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:38.524
We are. What a great thing to be.

01:42:40.237 --> 01:42:45.323
A real, healthy, just strong,
funny, kick-ass chick!

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:48.360
This new line of products
won't change your life.

01:42:48.454 --> 01:42:50.070
Only you can do that.

01:42:50.915 --> 01:42:52.656
And you can do that.

01:42:53.167 --> 01:42:54.157
Believe me.

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:59.087
But this line is for every girl
who is ready to believe in herself!

01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:03.166
You are beautiful!

01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:04.546
You are everything!

01:43:04.637 --> 01:43:06.924
And you are the real face of this line!

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:10.007
And we are all the face of Lily LeClaire!

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:16.726
Whoo!

01:43:16.816 --> 01:43:18.352
You go, Renee!

01:43:18.693 --> 01:43:20.059
You picked a good one, you know.

01:43:22.238 --> 01:43:23.445
Oh, my God!

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:31.653
Well, that was super weird.

01:43:32.707 --> 01:43:34.539
And also very effective.

01:43:35.918 --> 01:43:36.954
Thanks.

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:39.502
Do you know we offer
a mental health program at work?

01:43:39.797 --> 01:43:41.038
I still have a job?

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:43.460
Oh, my God.

01:43:45.302 --> 01:43:47.885
Thank you. Okay,
I'm gonna go say hi to some people.

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:53.641
Avery? They're going crazy for all this.

01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:55.765
Let's be honest. We both know.

01:43:56.188 --> 01:43:57.554
That's for Renee.

01:43:58.858 --> 01:44:00.019
Oh!

01:44:00.401 --> 01:44:03.985
Sweetheart,
Renee wouldn't be here without you.

01:44:05.114 --> 01:44:06.400
None of us would.

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.315
Oh, Gram.

01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:26.841
<i>This is Ethan.</i>

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:28.213
Hi, it's me.

01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:30.007
Renee.

01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:33.928
Um, I know you probably don't want
to see me right now, but I just...

01:44:34.393 --> 01:44:35.679
Just, please hear me out.

01:44:36.228 --> 01:44:37.935
Okay? I... I...

01:44:38.022 --> 01:44:40.765
I am so sorry for how I acted
the other night.

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:43.392
<i>I know this...</i>

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:45.685
<i>is hard to believe,
but it has nothing to do</i>

01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:47.112
<i>with how I feel about you.</i>

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:51.112
And everything to do
with my feelings about me.

01:44:52.286 --> 01:44:53.276
<i>And...</i>

01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:55.820
<i>I, uh...</i>

01:44:56.791 --> 01:44:58.874
<i>This is gonna sound so crazy, but I...</i>

01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:00.791
I thought that you thought

01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:02.870
that I was the most beautiful
woman in the world.

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:04.829
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:45:05.925 --> 01:45:08.793
I do think that you're the most
beautiful woman in the world.

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.213
Just let me real quick,

01:45:13.307 --> 01:45:14.764
- 'cause it was killing me...
- What?

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:16.341
You were, like, struggling with it.

01:45:16.435 --> 01:45:17.801
- You could see?
- Yeah, well, I saw...

01:45:17.895 --> 01:45:19.352
- That's a camera?
- Yeah.

01:45:19.438 --> 01:45:20.895
You could see me that whole time?

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:21.971
Renee...

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.516
I've always seen you.

01:45:43.546 --> 01:45:45.412
What's up, SoHo?

01:45:45.506 --> 01:45:47.498
You guys ready to change your life?

01:45:48.717 --> 01:45:49.628
Yes!

01:45:49.718 --> 01:45:51.710
I don't know what you
came in here for today,

01:45:51.804 --> 01:45:54.171
but the miracle is already here!

01:45:54.557 --> 01:45:57.345
You just have to open up
your heart and receive it!

01:45:58.060 --> 01:45:59.676
I want you to look into the mirror

01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:02.433
and visualize the change
you came in here for.

01:46:02.523 --> 01:46:05.391
Is it spiritual? Is it physical?

01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:06.770
Is it emotional?
