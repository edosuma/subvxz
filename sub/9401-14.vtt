00:00.010 --> 00:01.300
Previously on One Tree Hill...

00:01.310 --> 00:04.100
You are heading down a dangerous pass.

00:04.310 --> 00:05.500
You don't have a job.

00:05.568 --> 00:06.468
Your honor...

00:06.536 --> 00:07.936
She does have a job.

00:08.003 --> 00:09.671
She works for me.

00:09.739 --> 00:11.372
How did we get the
funding for the movie?

00:11.508 --> 00:14.739
My father and I put up the
money, because I believe in you.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.998
All day long I've been
trying to figure out

00:17.066 --> 00:19.974
how to get past the
you-and-Alex thing.

00:20.042 --> 00:21.816
Maybe right now, you
need to work on you,

00:21.883 --> 00:23.547
and I need to work on me.

00:24.114 --> 00:25.525
Goodbye, Brooke.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.789
Hey, Tay.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.290
You remember...

00:29.360 --> 00:31.018
I prefer to call him my new boyfriend.

Haley, stop!

00:57.010 --> 00:57.748
Sorry.

00:57.815 --> 00:59.090
Just trying to wake Taylor and David.

00:59.157 --> 01:00.194
I'm sure you did,

01:00.262 --> 01:01.931
Along with the rest of the neighborhood.

01:01.932 --> 01:03.272
How long have you been up?

01:03.340 --> 01:04.744
Since I dreamt that my sister

01:04.811 --> 01:06.486
was screwing my other sister's husband.

01:06.553 --> 01:07.890
Ex-husband.

01:07.958 --> 01:09.733
Did you dream that too that's so weird.

01:09.801 --> 01:10.972
Did I kill them in yours?

01:11.039 --> 01:12.647
No, actually, you played it cool.

01:12.715 --> 01:13.952
Well, then you really were dreaming,

01:14.020 --> 01:15.528
because there's no
way to play this cool.

01:15.596 --> 01:17.170
This is the most uncool
thing Taylor's ever done.

01:17.238 --> 01:19.478
Morning, kids.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.116
Good morning, slut.

01:21.183 --> 01:22.850
You can get your things and go now.

01:22.918 --> 01:24.118
What's wrong?

01:24.186 --> 01:25.686
Are you still mad about me and David?

01:25.787 --> 01:27.189
That's so last night.

01:27.257 --> 01:29.363
You like that outfit
enough to get buried in,

01:29.431 --> 01:31.337
or you want to go put something on?

01:31.404 --> 01:34.413
Why? It's nothing he hasn't seen before.

01:37.190 --> 01:39.261
But if you insist.

01:43.241 --> 01:45.278
Come... are you gonna say something?

01:45.346 --> 01:46.314
"I love you"?

01:47.518 --> 01:49.390
Good morning!

01:49.458 --> 01:50.527
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

01:50.595 --> 01:51.530
We're late for the video-game shoot.

01:51.598 --> 01:52.866
Better get going.

01:52.934 --> 01:54.136
Have a good day, Hales. Love you.

01:54.206 --> 01:55.039
Bye, mom.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.985
This house is perfect for the movie.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.326
How were you able to get it for free?

02:02.394 --> 02:04.398
What can I say? I'm a great producer.

02:05.868 --> 02:08.374
No, it's Lucas' house.
He said we could use it.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.851
How's rehearsal going with Alex DuprÃ©?

02:12.919 --> 02:16.860
I see she and Peter are...

02:18.432 --> 02:20.134
I think it's important
for a director and actor

02:20.203 --> 02:22.507
to establish boundaries early on.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.748
I know he's a little high-maintenance,

02:25.816 --> 02:27.352
but the guy's talented.

02:27.420 --> 02:29.021
Besides, the clock was ticking,

02:29.089 --> 02:30.191
and we didn't have much of a budget.

02:30.260 --> 02:31.628
Alex.

02:31.696 --> 02:34.100
Alex DuprÃ©, this is
my father, Paul Norris.

02:34.168 --> 02:36.205
It's nice to finally meet you, Paul.

02:36.273 --> 02:37.508
Nice to meet you, too, Alex.

02:37.576 --> 02:38.977
I've seen you in the trades.

02:39.045 --> 02:40.848
I've seen you in the tabloids.

02:40.916 --> 02:43.221
That was the old me.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.957
Good... I shouldn't have to tell you

02:45.024 --> 02:47.362
how important this film is
to both Julian and myself.

02:47.430 --> 02:50.067
You don't have to worry about
her, dad. She's here to work.

02:50.135 --> 02:51.804
Yep. I'm a professional.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.642
You're certainly dressed like one.

02:53.709 --> 02:55.144
Oh, thank you.

02:55.212 --> 02:57.483
I picked it out myself since
we don't have a wardrobe person.

02:57.551 --> 03:00.087
- Could we get to work, please?
- Bye.

03:02.226 --> 03:04.765
I haven't hired a costume designer yet.

03:04.832 --> 03:06.100
Why not?

03:06.168 --> 03:08.973
The person I wanted didn't work out.

03:12.115 --> 03:14.386
Dare I ask what's in the box?

03:14.454 --> 03:17.359
You're staring at it like
someone sent you a severed head.

03:19.096 --> 03:21.367
It's Julian's stuff.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.440
He broke up with me last night.

03:24.508 --> 03:28.047
Oh, honey, I'm sorry, dear.

03:34.329 --> 03:36.264
A head would have been an improvement.

03:38.002 --> 03:39.905
I want to take it to him,

03:39.972 --> 03:42.677
but I just don't think
I can see him right now.

03:42.745 --> 03:45.916
And I really don't want to see Alex.

03:45.984 --> 03:47.653
Even if her head were severed?

03:47.721 --> 03:50.525
Stop talking about severed heads!

03:50.593 --> 03:53.030
Okay, how about I take care of the box?

03:53.098 --> 03:54.400
Okay?

03:54.467 --> 03:56.102
I mean, we run a
multimillion-dollar company.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.705
I'm sure we can afford a courier.

03:57.773 --> 04:00.311
There's no need for unnecessary drama.

04:07.156 --> 04:08.522
Before I forget,

04:08.590 --> 04:10.191
Millicent is working with us again.

04:10.259 --> 04:12.629
Shall be in this morning.

04:23.928 --> 04:25.995
So much for our security deposit.

04:26.063 --> 04:27.695
Sorry about the mess.

04:27.763 --> 04:30.766
I'll clean it when I get back from work.

04:30.833 --> 04:35.268
I'm not worried about the
place. I'm worried about you.

04:35.334 --> 04:36.400
Are you okay?

04:38.035 --> 04:40.801
Not really, but I'm trying.

04:42.870 --> 04:45.370
Have you thought about
going back to rehab?

04:46.939 --> 04:49.606
Yeah, I've thought about it.

04:49.674 --> 04:52.508
Well, lemme know if there's
anything I can do to help.

04:58.547 --> 05:00.915
How long are you staying?

05:00.983 --> 05:04.852
I'm not sure. Maybe... a day or two?

05:04.920 --> 05:07.421
But you'll be here when I get home?

05:07.489 --> 05:09.322
Yeah.

05:09.390 --> 05:10.690
That helps.

05:23.705 --> 05:24.972
Come on.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.808
You cannot expect me to honestly believe

05:26.876 --> 05:28.976
that this... thing
between the two of you

05:29.044 --> 05:30.944
is anything more than some sick joke.

05:31.012 --> 05:32.112
What's so sick about it?

05:32.180 --> 05:33.280
David's a great guy.

05:33.347 --> 05:35.214
Quinn couldn't see it. I can.

05:35.282 --> 05:37.083
Can't you just be happy for us?

05:37.150 --> 05:38.617
You know what would make me happy,

05:38.685 --> 05:40.085
is throwing you out a window.

05:40.153 --> 05:42.287
But I'm gonna settle for
you using the front door.

05:42.355 --> 05:44.055
That's no way to treat your sister

05:44.123 --> 05:46.491
and possible two-time
brother-in-law.

05:48.227 --> 05:49.928
Good morning, Haley.

05:49.995 --> 05:52.530
"Good morning." Yeah,
don't "morning" me, David.

05:52.598 --> 05:54.999
You will have to forgive my sister.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.567
She's cranky this morning.

05:56.635 --> 05:58.503
Hopefully, she'll be in
a better mood tonight.

06:00.306 --> 06:03.007
David and I are cooking
dinner for everyone tonight.

06:03.075 --> 06:05.176
No, that's not happening! You can't...

06:05.244 --> 06:07.745
That's not happening...
not tonight, not ever.

06:07.812 --> 06:09.679
Why not? Quinn already agreed to it.

06:09.746 --> 06:11.879
I'll see you tonight.

06:14.313 --> 06:15.346
David!

06:18.083 --> 06:20.517
How can you do this to Quinn?

06:20.585 --> 06:22.753
It's no worse than what she did to me.

06:25.189 --> 06:27.056
I told them we slept together.

06:27.124 --> 06:29.258
What?

06:31.160 --> 06:33.995
So, now you want me to
go to dinner with your ex,

06:34.062 --> 06:35.929
who probably wants to kill me,

06:35.997 --> 06:38.265
and your sister, who's obviously insane?

06:38.332 --> 06:39.466
Yeah, it's okay.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.101
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.202
I just... I don't get it.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.904
I know why David wants to hurt you,

06:44.971 --> 06:47.172
but why would your own
sister go along with it?

06:48.608 --> 06:50.275
You have to know Taylor.

06:50.342 --> 06:52.677
When we were kids, she
tried stealing my boyfriends.

06:52.744 --> 06:55.145
And now she's after my ex-husband.

06:55.213 --> 06:57.614
So, I guess she never grew up.

06:57.682 --> 06:59.282
And that doesn't bother you?

07:01.952 --> 07:05.052
A little, but not nearly
as much as that does.

07:22.648 --> 07:24.882
See, how cool is your dad?

07:26.952 --> 07:28.386
I mean, not now, of course,

07:28.453 --> 07:30.621
but he is gonna look great
in this new video game.

07:30.689 --> 07:32.023
When do I get to play?

07:32.790 --> 07:34.592
Well, the game won't
be ready for a month,

07:34.659 --> 07:37.558
but we shod be able to get you
a prototype to play tonight.

07:40.128 --> 07:41.628
You look good covered in balls.

07:41.696 --> 07:43.730
Now I know how Taylor feels.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.464
Hey, speaking of, I, uh...

07:45.532 --> 07:47.232
Take it you heard about
this dinner tonight?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.867
Yes.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.435
I got a very angry text
message from my wife.

07:50.503 --> 07:51.837
You coming?

07:51.904 --> 07:54.972
No, i, uh, think I have
some work to catch up on.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.340
Quinn's okay with that?

07:56.408 --> 07:57.775
I mean, if Haley's this pissed,

07:57.843 --> 07:59.643
I can't imagine how upset Quinn must be.

07:59.711 --> 08:01.611
It's strange, but she seems okay.

08:01.679 --> 08:03.847
She was more upset by Kylie showing up

08:03.914 --> 08:05.815
for a swim in my pool this morning.

08:05.883 --> 08:07.283
Who is Kylie?!

08:07.351 --> 08:10.919
Some chick who took a whore
bath in Clay's pool this morning.

08:10.987 --> 08:12.653
My God, Quinn, that's awful.

08:12.721 --> 08:15.388
Must just make you want
to rip David's head off

08:15.456 --> 08:17.657
and punch Taylor right in her fat face.

08:17.724 --> 08:19.191
You shouldn't let them get to you.

08:19.259 --> 08:20.827
How are they not getting to you?

08:20.895 --> 08:22.529
David has a right to be upset with me,

08:22.597 --> 08:24.197
and Taylor's always been a bitch.

08:24.264 --> 08:25.798
So what do you want me to do?

08:25.865 --> 08:28.934
Uh, I don't know, say no when
they invite you to dinner.

08:29.002 --> 08:30.669
Clay makes me happy, Haley!

08:30.737 --> 08:32.437
Why shouldn't David be happy?

08:32.505 --> 08:35.472
I mean, I can't imagine that
Taylor is the one for him,

08:35.539 --> 08:37.307
but if she is, I'll deal with it.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.142
Just like that?

08:39.210 --> 08:40.977
If they want to throw their
relationship in my face,

08:41.044 --> 08:42.945
I have to let them know it
doesn't bother me, right?

08:43.013 --> 08:44.881
No! Not right! And let
me tell you something.

08:44.949 --> 08:46.350
If Nathan and I got divorced

08:46.418 --> 08:48.286
and he and Taylor showed
up playing kissy-face,

08:48.354 --> 08:50.089
not only would I never see them again,

08:50.157 --> 08:51.624
nobody else would, either.

08:51.692 --> 08:54.826
So you're saying I should kill them.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.829
I mean, it's a little
extreme, don't you think?

08:57.896 --> 08:58.996
No, you're right.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.599
Having dinner with them
is so much more sane.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.867
See you tonight.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.243
How you holding up today?

09:16.248 --> 09:17.548
Still upset, I see.

09:17.616 --> 09:19.150
"Clothes Over Psychos"

09:19.217 --> 09:21.452
coming this fall to prisons everywhere.

09:22.819 --> 09:24.222
Hey, Brooke.

09:27.090 --> 09:28.890
Alexander Coyne.

09:28.958 --> 09:30.858
Millicent Huxtable. Nice to meet you.

09:32.294 --> 09:34.395
Do you need help with anything?

09:34.463 --> 09:36.563
Just ask Victoria...

09:36.631 --> 09:39.099
'cause you work for her.

09:44.237 --> 09:46.237
Wow. You're a mean boss.

09:46.305 --> 09:47.672
You're like an evil Disney character

09:47.740 --> 09:50.607
who feeds her servants porridge
and pays them in buttons.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.655
Lauren. Hi. What are you doing here?

10:06.723 --> 10:07.723
Hey, I just talked to Antwon.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.292
He said you were back in town.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.928
Oh, looks like you had
one hell of a party.

10:11.996 --> 10:12.996
I'm sorry I missed it.

10:13.063 --> 10:14.297
Yeah, I missed it, too.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.231
But, uh, at least I get to clean it.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.533
Do you want some help?

10:18.601 --> 10:21.068
Come on, we can pretend we're CSI

10:21.136 --> 10:22.736
and re-create what happened.

10:22.803 --> 10:24.437
I don't think I want to know.

10:24.505 --> 10:26.139
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

10:26.206 --> 10:28.173
First one who finds the couch wins?

10:28.241 --> 10:28.974
All right.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.082
Can Chuck come over and
play the new game tonight?

10:36.149 --> 10:38.486
Yeah, of course. You
two are friends again?

10:38.553 --> 10:40.454
- Yeah. We homies.
- See?

10:40.522 --> 10:41.889
Sometimes friends, they fight,

10:41.957 --> 10:44.259
they get mad at each other,
but then they make up.

10:44.326 --> 10:47.228
Like mom, aunt Quinn, and aunt Taylor?

10:47.296 --> 10:48.962
Exactly. They're mad at each other now,

10:49.030 --> 10:50.597
but eventually it'll blow over.

10:55.001 --> 10:57.602
Hey, what's going on?

10:57.670 --> 10:59.204
Well, let's see Taylor
try and cook dinner

10:59.271 --> 11:00.338
with no pots and pans.

11:04.443 --> 11:06.544
You and Chuck play upstairs tonight.

11:13.283 --> 11:15.717
I can't find Alex. Have you seen her?

11:15.785 --> 11:18.186
Have you checked your hand?
It's usually on her ass.

11:19.621 --> 11:21.154
What do you need her for, anyway?

11:21.222 --> 11:23.089
I want to put my hand on her ass.

11:23.157 --> 11:25.792
Why don't you just leave
her alone and let her act?

11:25.860 --> 11:27.693
What's the point of being
in a movie with Alex DuprÃ©

11:27.760 --> 11:28.994
if I don't get to sleep with her?

11:29.061 --> 11:30.928
The point is that she's a great actress

11:30.996 --> 11:32.763
who wrote an amazing script.

11:32.830 --> 11:35.500
Oh, sure, but it doesn't hurt that
she's gone down more times than the sun.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.270
If you see her, tell
her I'm in my trailer.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.209
Brooke thought you might
want your stuff back.

11:46.878 --> 11:49.179
Sorry, man.

11:57.505 --> 11:59.840
I don't appreciate you
sending your boy toy

11:59.907 --> 12:01.207
to deliver my stuff.

12:01.275 --> 12:03.342
W... well, I don't appreciate

12:03.409 --> 12:05.443
the dumping you delivered
to me last night,

12:05.511 --> 12:06.611
so I guess we're even.

12:06.679 --> 12:07.479
Oh, come on, Brooke.

12:07.547 --> 12:08.781
You broke up with me when you left.

12:08.849 --> 12:10.948
I just had the nerve
to call it what it was.

12:11.016 --> 12:13.216
And I didn't need to send
an Alex to do it for me.

12:13.284 --> 12:15.318
I just needed some space!

12:17.422 --> 12:20.191
Well, you got it.

12:36.671 --> 12:38.404
Hey, there.

12:38.472 --> 12:41.640
Oh. It's me, by the way... Quinn.

12:41.708 --> 12:43.041
Just in case you were wondering.

12:43.109 --> 12:44.342
I mean, you never know
who's gonna stop by

12:44.411 --> 12:45.512
for a swim, right?

12:45.580 --> 12:47.814
I'm sorry about this morning, Quinn.

12:47.882 --> 12:49.948
I didn't know she was coming over,

12:50.016 --> 12:51.650
and it won't happen again.

12:51.717 --> 12:54.319
Just her or all the others, too?

12:56.122 --> 12:57.889
I don't know who you think I am.

12:57.957 --> 13:00.424
I know exactly who you are.

13:00.492 --> 13:02.192
Maybe who I used to be.

13:02.260 --> 13:04.228
It's okay.

13:04.295 --> 13:06.129
It's only been a couple of months.

13:06.197 --> 13:08.297
I can't expect y to
be a different person.

13:08.365 --> 13:10.165
No. But you can expect me

13:10.233 --> 13:13.634
to be the type of guy
that you can count on.

13:13.702 --> 13:15.736
I'm coming with you tonight.

13:15.803 --> 13:17.304
Really?

13:17.372 --> 13:18.504
Yeah.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.841
Wow, I didn't see that one coming.

13:22.909 --> 13:25.910
You know what else
you didn't see coming?

13:37.285 --> 13:38.884
What are you doing?

13:38.952 --> 13:41.220
I'm spoiling my appetite.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.156
Haley, if you're so against this dinner,

13:43.224 --> 13:45.158
then why did you agree to it?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.792
It's a bad idea.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.625
Of course it's a bad
idea. It's a terrible idea.

13:48.693 --> 13:50.829
But if Quinn and Taylor
say I should be fine,

13:50.897 --> 13:52.164
I'm gonna be fine.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.564
- You seem fine.
- Oh, I am.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.499
I'm gonna sit at dinner
like a perfect little angel.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.500
And I'm gonna say, "oh,
that's so nice, Taylor."

13:57.568 --> 13:59.902
"Um, Taylor, that's
a really funny story."

13:59.970 --> 14:01.837
"Would you please pass
the potatoes, Taylor?"

14:01.905 --> 14:04.173
Only there won't be any potatoes.

14:08.179 --> 14:10.681
Hey, Brooke! S'up?

14:10.748 --> 14:11.815
Hi.

14:13.517 --> 14:15.384
I was just feeling a little lost,

14:15.452 --> 14:19.220
so I thought I'd come see
the most stable couple I know.

14:24.825 --> 14:26.792
The suspect started here,

14:26.860 --> 14:28.360
but he couldn't hold his liquor,

14:28.427 --> 14:30.327
so he stashed the wounded soldier

14:30.395 --> 14:32.095
and made a mad dash for the bathroom.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.462
How would you know that?

14:33.530 --> 14:34.963
Splatter pattern.

14:35.898 --> 14:38.699
Looks like he projectiled
from over here.

14:38.766 --> 14:39.933
That is really gross.

14:40.001 --> 14:41.801
Yeah. You can clean that up.

14:47.372 --> 14:49.739
So, are you here for good,
or is this just a visit?

14:49.807 --> 14:50.874
Uh, I'm not sure.

14:50.941 --> 14:52.108
I really only left

14:52.175 --> 14:53.476
'cause Millie and I
were having problems.

14:53.543 --> 14:54.811
I thought it would do me some good.

14:54.879 --> 14:56.279
You know, out of sight, out of mind.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.648
Did it work?

14:57.716 --> 14:59.218
No.

14:59.286 --> 15:00.589
She was just out of sight.

15:03.425 --> 15:05.026
I'll clean the vomit.

15:08.163 --> 15:10.330
That makes me sick! Taylor is awful!

15:10.397 --> 15:11.964
I thought Alex was a bitch.

15:12.032 --> 15:13.532
Ye, I know, right?

15:13.599 --> 15:14.866
And don't worry about Alex.

15:14.934 --> 15:16.400
Julian obviously still loves you.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.068
Brooke, he stayed in Tree
Hill to make his movie.

15:18.069 --> 15:19.903
Yeah, well, he made it very clear today

15:19.971 --> 15:21.305
that he does not want to see me anymore.

15:21.372 --> 15:22.775
He is probably just upset.

15:22.843 --> 15:25.411
You guys are way too good
together not to make it.

15:25.479 --> 15:26.679
Just give it some time.

15:26.747 --> 15:28.548
Okay.

15:28.616 --> 15:30.383
Fine.

15:31.685 --> 15:33.252
Don't worry about this dinner tonight.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.288
You know, it's gonna be
over before you know it.

15:35.356 --> 15:37.457
Actually, Nathan's betting we
don't make it through dinner.

15:37.525 --> 15:39.058
He said he thinks I'm
gonna attack Taylor

15:39.126 --> 15:40.059
before the salad is served.

15:40.127 --> 15:41.760
Well, can you blame him?

15:41.828 --> 15:44.963
You've been arrested more times
than anyone I know, "Jailey."

15:45.031 --> 15:46.431
I hate my name.

15:50.202 --> 15:53.671
Let the wild rumpus start.

15:53.738 --> 15:55.072
Thanks, Hales.

15:55.140 --> 15:57.007
You'll be okay.

15:58.442 --> 16:01.110
Enjoy your last supper, Judas.

16:03.679 --> 16:05.813
If you're going to act like a porn star,

16:05.880 --> 16:07.747
the least you could do is
take your bloody clothes off!

16:07.815 --> 16:11.218
Oh, oh, hold on. Okay, Alex, come here.

16:11.286 --> 16:14.321
We're in the middle of rehearsal here.

16:14.388 --> 16:15.688
- Are you okay?
- No.

16:15.756 --> 16:17.056
He keeps hitting on me.

16:17.124 --> 16:18.557
And when I wouldn't say
hello to his "little friend,"

16:18.625 --> 16:21.093
he got mad and said I
wasn't right for the part.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.728
I think he's trying to make me quit.

16:23.796 --> 16:25.630
Okay, I'll take care of
it. Just do your best.

16:27.433 --> 16:28.967
Could you do me a favor, Peter?

16:29.034 --> 16:30.868
I'm not big on favors.

16:30.936 --> 16:32.336
Okay, then, I'll make it an order.

16:32.403 --> 16:33.535
Take it easy on Alex.

16:33.603 --> 16:35.603
Maybe you could give her some direction

16:35.671 --> 16:36.971
instead of just yelling at her.

16:38.173 --> 16:40.174
Whatever you say, boss.

16:41.943 --> 16:43.310
Let's take it from the top.

16:49.249 --> 16:50.582
Chuck's here, buddy.

16:50.650 --> 16:53.618
So, where's this brand-new
game that's not even out yet?

16:53.685 --> 16:56.520
Right here. It's really cool.

16:56.588 --> 16:58.822
We'll see. I get to be your dad.

17:00.558 --> 17:02.626
Nice to have you back, Chuck.

17:02.693 --> 17:04.194
Whatever.

17:06.063 --> 17:07.829
You're not using the good silverware?

17:07.897 --> 17:09.464
Good silverware is for good people.

17:09.531 --> 17:11.967
They're lucky I'm not making
them eat off the floor.

17:12.035 --> 17:13.435
Are you gonna be civil tonight?

17:15.237 --> 17:17.805
Just try, Haley, please.
It's only one night.

17:17.873 --> 17:20.040
Look, we've weathered
Dan's crap for years.

17:20.108 --> 17:21.474
This should be easy.

17:22.609 --> 17:23.843
Got it!

17:32.285 --> 17:34.786
You must be Quinn's boyfriend.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.355
And you must be her crazy sister.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.127
I'm not crazy.

17:43.194 --> 17:45.662
I love him.

17:45.730 --> 17:47.398
He's all I ever dream about,

17:47.466 --> 17:50.968
and I dot care if
anybody else gets that.

17:51.035 --> 17:52.936
So I'm going back to him.

17:53.004 --> 17:55.538
That's awful! Just awful!

17:55.606 --> 17:57.674
Can't you do anything right?

17:58.909 --> 18:00.442
Obviously not.

18:00.510 --> 18:01.543
Cut deeper next time.

18:05.181 --> 18:06.581
How's that for direction?

18:08.683 --> 18:11.885
When he comes to, tell him he's fired.

18:18.011 --> 18:20.611
Okay, let's get this over with.

18:20.979 --> 18:22.512
Can we say grace first?

18:22.779 --> 18:24.013
You're religious now?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.447
Well, I have been calling out

18:25.515 --> 18:26.816
God's name a lot lately.

18:29.952 --> 18:33.683
Thank you, God, for my wonderful family,

18:33.751 --> 18:36.218
for the food that we're
about to receive...

18:36.286 --> 18:38.153
And for David.

18:38.221 --> 18:39.955
His chest...

18:40.023 --> 18:42.090
strong arms...

18:43.259 --> 18:44.859
home theater...

18:44.927 --> 18:47.595
Oh, she does love the home theater.

18:50.598 --> 18:51.464
Amen.

18:51.532 --> 18:52.232
Amen.

18:53.200 --> 18:53.933
Amen!

18:55.502 --> 18:57.103
Amen.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.641
How's your hand?

19:03.709 --> 19:06.344
Better than his head.

19:07.612 --> 19:09.446
Thanks for sticking up for me.

19:09.513 --> 19:12.014
You've had to do that a lot lately.

19:12.082 --> 19:14.717
I'm pretty sure nobody
thinks I can do this movie.

19:16.319 --> 19:19.421
Since when do you give a crap
about what anybody else thinks?

19:19.488 --> 19:21.055
It's just...

19:22.457 --> 19:24.225
what if I screw up?

19:30.365 --> 19:32.065
You won't.

19:32.133 --> 19:34.534
Have some faith in yourself.

19:34.601 --> 19:36.002
I do.

19:36.069 --> 19:38.003
I won't let you down.

19:38.071 --> 19:39.871
I know.

19:51.282 --> 19:52.649
What was I saying?

19:52.716 --> 19:55.485
You said, "watch this."

19:55.553 --> 19:58.154
So, uh, I think we're all curious.

19:58.222 --> 20:00.222
How exactly did you two get together?

20:00.290 --> 20:01.925
Glad you asked.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.093
It was just another boring d at the gym

20:04.161 --> 20:05.728
when who should accidentally

20:05.796 --> 20:07.730
walk into my stripper aerobics class?

20:10.199 --> 20:11.332
David.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.467
Ooh!

20:12.534 --> 20:14.068
Quinny's got herself a smart one.

20:14.136 --> 20:16.503
Yes. David.

20:16.571 --> 20:18.372
He was so embarrassed to leave,

20:18.439 --> 20:20.207
he stayed the entire class.

20:20.275 --> 20:22.509
And it was quite a workout.

20:22.576 --> 20:25.678
I gave him a private
session later that night.

20:27.047 --> 20:29.548
And the rest, as they say, is sex.

20:31.383 --> 20:34.852
I'm really happy you
two found each other.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.754
Okay, if nobody else is
gonna say it, then I will.

20:37.822 --> 20:39.156
Please don't, Haley.

20:39.223 --> 20:41.024
Taylor, at any point,
did it occur to you,

20:41.092 --> 20:43.059
"hooking up with my
sister's ex-husband...

20:43.127 --> 20:45.294
That might be kind of
insensitive...and whorish"?!

20:45.362 --> 20:46.829
Funny, no.

20:46.896 --> 20:48.530
David, you and Quinn just got divorced.

20:48.598 --> 20:50.065
How can you sleep with
someone else so soon?

20:50.133 --> 20:51.432
Especially our sister!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.701
Oh, you want to talk about
insensitive and horish?

20:53.769 --> 20:57.104
Quinn had sex with this bozo
when we were still married.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.538
What?

21:01.208 --> 21:04.176
Actually, uh...

21:04.244 --> 21:06.445
we've never had sex.

21:06.512 --> 21:08.680
I just told you that we did.

21:24.526 --> 21:26.662
Yes, Nate, I would love another beer.

21:26.729 --> 21:27.630
Good idea.

21:30.366 --> 21:32.234
Boy, can you clear a room.

21:40.108 --> 21:41.341
David.

21:41.408 --> 21:43.142
How could you lie to me
about something like that?

21:43.210 --> 21:44.710
Because you weren't letting go!

21:44.777 --> 21:46.978
Okay, I needed you to move on,

21:47.046 --> 21:49.180
and I thought the only way
you'd do it is if you hated me.

21:49.248 --> 21:53.250
Well, mission
accomplished. I do hate you.

21:53.317 --> 21:54.884
David, listen to me.

21:54.952 --> 21:57.520
You know what? And say
what you want about Taylor.

21:57.588 --> 21:59.489
At least she's been honest with me.

22:06.062 --> 22:07.930
I thought contract
negotiations were tense?

22:07.998 --> 22:09.597
It is insane in that room.

22:11.499 --> 22:12.900
And David's bigger than I remember.

22:16.205 --> 22:18.338
So you really haven't slept with her?

22:18.406 --> 22:21.208
Shut up, man. I like her.

22:21.275 --> 22:22.442
I can tell.

22:22.510 --> 22:24.877
You came here instead
of hiding out somewhere.

22:24.945 --> 22:26.812
Yeah, I thought I owed her that much,

22:26.880 --> 22:28.847
especially after the whole Kylie thing.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.854
Hey, I don't suppose that we could just

22:31.922 --> 22:34.857
hide in here for a
while and not go back?

22:34.925 --> 22:36.592
Probably not.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.760
Anyway, you're the one that added

22:38.827 --> 22:41.295
"falling insanely in love
with Quinn" to my contract.

22:41.363 --> 22:44.798
Probably should have added
sex to that, too, huh?

22:51.104 --> 22:55.040
Why did you send Alexander
to drop off Julian's stuff?

22:55.108 --> 22:56.407
He's really upset!

22:56.475 --> 23:00.144
What happened "no need
for unnecessary drama"?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.146
Yeah, well, that drama
was very necessary, dear.

23:02.213 --> 23:04.381
I needed to show you that he
still had feelings for you.

23:04.448 --> 23:06.483
Whatever you do with that
information is up to you.

23:06.550 --> 23:07.317
Mother!

23:07.384 --> 23:08.985
All right, enough said.

23:09.053 --> 23:10.520
I'll keep out of it.

23:10.587 --> 23:13.523
Now, onto other business.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.558
Millicent... you're shutting her out.

23:15.626 --> 23:17.093
What do you care?

23:17.161 --> 23:19.261
Well, I've never been
a fan of Millicent's,

23:19.329 --> 23:21.030
but she was always there for you.

23:21.098 --> 23:23.865
She believed in you when
your own mother didn't.

23:23.933 --> 23:26.367
And now she needs
someone to believe in her.

23:26.435 --> 23:28.636
More important, she needs a friend.

23:28.704 --> 23:31.239
No, she doesn't. She has you.

23:31.307 --> 23:33.875
I am not the friend type.

23:35.711 --> 23:38.480
Now I know who Clay reminds me of.

23:38.548 --> 23:41.583
Who was that guy that
you dated freshman year?

23:41.651 --> 23:43.785
Dan Thomson?

23:43.853 --> 23:46.221
Whatever happened to him?

23:46.289 --> 23:49.391
You told him you'd sleep with
him if he broke up with me

23:49.458 --> 23:51.693
so he did... and then you did.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.462
That's right. I'm the sister
who actually sleeps with guys.

23:56.365 --> 23:59.467
Do they give you a medal
for that or just a shot?

23:59.534 --> 24:01.902
We have cupcakes for dessert,

24:01.970 --> 24:04.304
in case anybody wants them.

24:04.372 --> 24:06.439
I bought them for Jamie, but Taylor
doesn't seem to have a problem

24:06.507 --> 24:08.341
taking other people's stuff.

24:08.409 --> 24:09.742
I wish I could be like you, Haley.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.044
Just eat whatever I want and get fat.

24:12.111 --> 24:13.810
Your lip is about to get fat!

24:13.878 --> 24:15.245
All right, that's enough.
I can't take this anymore.

24:15.312 --> 24:16.445
If anybody needs me,

24:16.513 --> 24:17.579
I'll be upstairs with the kids,

24:17.647 --> 24:19.214
having a more mature conversation.

24:21.951 --> 24:24.619
Your dad sucks!

24:24.687 --> 24:26.154
Excuse me?

24:26.222 --> 24:27.821
Chuck says your
character isn't that good.

24:27.889 --> 24:29.154
I said he sucks.

24:29.222 --> 24:31.486
And he hasn't even made one basket yet.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.021
Well, I'm sure my character is fine.

24:35.657 --> 24:37.325
Why am I crying?

24:37.392 --> 24:39.060
Because you got dunked on three times,

24:39.127 --> 24:40.728
and then a fan threw a soda at you.

24:44.366 --> 24:46.666
I thought you were supposed to be good.

24:46.734 --> 24:48.234
I was.

24:48.301 --> 24:49.534
I am.

24:49.602 --> 24:50.869
Give me this.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.382
I heard you fired Peter.

25:10.450 --> 25:14.117
Yeah, I haven't had a great day.

25:14.185 --> 25:15.985
I also heard you knocked him out.

25:16.053 --> 25:17.753
His day was worse.

25:17.821 --> 25:22.390
You seem to be moving
backwards as a producer.

25:22.458 --> 25:24.025
We start filming in a week.

25:24.093 --> 25:25.693
You have no costume designer.

25:25.761 --> 25:27.061
You knocked out my director.

25:27.128 --> 25:28.295
In fact, all you do have

25:28.363 --> 25:31.264
is an unreliable, uninsurable actress.

25:31.332 --> 25:34.067
We've both invested a lot
of money in this movie.

25:34.134 --> 25:35.368
Find a way to fix it.

25:49.538 --> 25:51.172
Hey, why couldn't I do that?

25:51.273 --> 25:53.340
I guess only a Scott can play a Scott.

25:55.310 --> 25:57.244
Come on come on, come on!

25:57.311 --> 25:59.612
Boom! Game!

25:59.780 --> 26:02.014
Eat that, Chuck! Who sucks now, huh?

26:02.081 --> 26:03.014
You do.

26:08.686 --> 26:12.288
When you're, um, done with
your "mature conversation,"

26:12.355 --> 26:13.555
can I talk to you for a second?

26:19.359 --> 26:20.692
Will you talk to David?

26:20.760 --> 26:22.794
Will you help him realize
that what he's doing is wrong?

26:22.862 --> 26:24.898
Please, please.

26:24.966 --> 26:26.802
Okay, yes. I'll be right down.

26:26.870 --> 26:28.971
Okay. I'll be down in a sec.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.808
All right, guys. I
got to head back down.

26:32.876 --> 26:34.508
Everyone still fighting?

26:34.576 --> 26:36.942
Afraid so.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.682
Dude, your family's lame.

26:48.087 --> 26:50.387
Hey, you.

26:54.386 --> 26:57.521
I shouldn't have lied to David.

26:57.589 --> 27:00.624
Quinn, don't beat yourself up.

27:00.691 --> 27:03.659
Look, I think everyone has
done things in their past

27:03.727 --> 27:04.893
that they regret.

27:04.961 --> 27:07.195
I know I have...

27:07.297 --> 27:09.299
He said about Kylie.

27:11.235 --> 27:12.702
Yeah, it just makes it hard

27:12.770 --> 27:14.737
when our pasts are swimming in our pools

27:14.805 --> 27:15.905
and cooking us dinner.

27:15.972 --> 27:18.407
I know.

27:24.813 --> 27:26.914
What's up?

27:28.717 --> 27:31.652
What? What's so funny?

27:31.719 --> 27:34.821
Just tell me you know
how messed up this is.

27:34.889 --> 27:37.924
I was just trying to show Quinn...

27:40.460 --> 27:43.261
Yes, it's messed up.

27:43.328 --> 27:47.866
Okay. That's all I wanted to hear.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.103
So you're not mad?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.438
Well, I can't say I totally
support what you're doing,

27:53.506 --> 27:55.307
but, um, I also didn't like

27:55.374 --> 27:57.709
the way Quinn handled things, so...

27:57.777 --> 27:59.911
Thanks.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.947
But I got to say that
you are handling this

28:03.014 --> 28:05.015
way better than I would have.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.352
It helps that you're here with me.

28:08.419 --> 28:10.087
Thank you.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.822
I'm happy to be here.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.358
But I'm also happy to leave.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.427
I'm just saying...

28:17.495 --> 28:18.628
Yeah.

28:18.729 --> 28:20.563
Anytime.

28:26.237 --> 28:29.337
So, are you really into Taylor,

28:29.405 --> 28:31.672
or was this all just
to get back at Quinn?

28:31.740 --> 28:34.508
We're actually having fun together.

28:34.576 --> 28:37.477
She's the first person
that's made me smile in...

28:37.545 --> 28:39.479
Longer than I can remember.

28:39.547 --> 28:42.848
Well...that's good.

28:42.916 --> 28:45.383
Just make sure you like
her for the right reasons

28:45.451 --> 28:47.719
and not because she
reminds you of her sister.

28:53.491 --> 28:54.458
So we're cool?

28:54.526 --> 28:55.826
Yeah.

28:55.894 --> 28:58.797
But if Haley asks, I yelled
at you, and you're sorry.

28:58.865 --> 29:01.234
I am.

29:01.302 --> 29:03.771
Okay.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.418
The place looks great. Thank you.

29:14.485 --> 29:16.587
Yeah, just don't ever

29:16.654 --> 29:18.021
look under the third cushion.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.790
There are bad things under there!

29:21.292 --> 29:23.326
How lame is it that I
actually had fun cleaning?

29:23.394 --> 29:25.562
Can you tell how starved
for company I've been?

29:25.629 --> 29:27.230
I know how you feel.

29:27.298 --> 29:29.199
I don't know anyone
in L.A. besides Skills,

29:29.267 --> 29:31.801
and I barely see him
'cause he's so busy.

29:31.869 --> 29:33.302
Yeah.

29:33.370 --> 29:35.637
Being alone sucks.

29:35.705 --> 29:39.042
Skills misses you. You know that, right?

29:39.109 --> 29:42.013
I know.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.315
It's just...

29:44.383 --> 29:45.951
being alone sucks.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.187
Yeah.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.699
Sorry about this morning.

30:00.767 --> 30:02.434
I'm sorry, too.

30:02.502 --> 30:06.105
I should have brought
the box to you myself.

30:06.172 --> 30:09.708
But I just thought it would
be too hard to see you.

30:09.776 --> 30:12.211
That makes what I want to ask difficult.

30:14.848 --> 30:16.048
The movie shoots in a week,

30:16.116 --> 30:17.850
and we don't have a costume designer.

30:17.918 --> 30:19.585
And the reason we don't

30:19.653 --> 30:23.288
is because I was planning on
asking you when you got back...

30:23.356 --> 30:25.624
Which is why I'm asking you now.

30:25.692 --> 30:27.925
We just broke up.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.960
I know.

30:30.027 --> 30:31.962
Good timing, huh?

30:34.200 --> 30:36.602
But you're the only one I trust,

30:36.670 --> 30:39.104
and I need the best for this movie.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.272
I would love to help you,

30:41.340 --> 30:43.841
but I don't know if I can do that.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.809
Just think about it. Okay?

30:45.877 --> 30:47.544
You... you don't even have to look at me

30:47.612 --> 30:49.047
if you don't want to.

30:54.891 --> 30:57.927
Okay, I'll... think about it.

30:57.994 --> 30:59.929
Thanks.

31:15.410 --> 31:16.710
Haley.

31:18.477 --> 31:19.642
I'm sorry.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.077
We were wrong to come here.

31:21.145 --> 31:23.712
Thank you. That means a lot, David.

31:23.780 --> 31:26.346
Don't apologize. We
haven't done anything wrong.

31:26.413 --> 31:28.012
You know, maybe David hasn't,

31:28.079 --> 31:31.378
but you have been a problem
your whole life, Taylor.

31:31.446 --> 31:33.313
When Haley got her first period,

31:33.380 --> 31:35.947
you tried to convince
her that she was dying!

31:36.015 --> 31:38.549
You told crazy uncle Frank that i...

31:38.616 --> 31:40.283
That I had a crush on him?

31:40.351 --> 31:42.817
Oh, in high school,
you had sex in mom's car

31:42.885 --> 31:44.551
and then told her it was me.

31:44.618 --> 31:46.918
Well, to be fair, it was
with your ex-boyfriend.

31:46.986 --> 31:49.052
And now you're sleeping with David!

31:49.119 --> 31:50.419
Why are you getting so mad at me

31:50.487 --> 31:51.719
about going after Quinn's leftovers?

31:51.787 --> 31:52.653
You went after mine.

31:52.721 --> 31:54.153
I want you to admit

31:54.221 --> 31:55.854
that what you're doing is wrong!

31:55.922 --> 31:57.522
No! Say you're happy for me!

31:57.589 --> 32:00.224
Taylor, I'm so sick of

32:00.292 --> 32:02.260
you're such a bitch to
everyone your whole life!

32:02.327 --> 32:04.528
Haley! Taylor!

32:04.596 --> 32:05.462
Give us your blessing, Haley!

32:26.678 --> 32:29.641
Dude, I take it back.
Your family's cool!

32:29.708 --> 32:31.639
I got five bucks on my mom.

32:31.707 --> 32:33.972
Oh, yeah!

32:44.920 --> 32:46.553
You lucky, if Nathan
hadn't stopped the fight,

32:46.620 --> 32:48.821
I'd have one less
Christmas card to send.

32:48.888 --> 32:51.190
Oh, no. You mean I wouldn't
get another Christmas card

32:51.326 --> 32:53.494
if Jamie dressed hasn't
out whatever would I do?

32:53.561 --> 32:55.765
Enough already! Just stop!

32:56.333 --> 32:59.268
Just stop, please!

33:01.438 --> 33:03.674
Did you get what you wanted?

33:03.742 --> 33:05.444
Are you satisfied now?

33:05.512 --> 33:07.314
Nightly.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.789
Just promise me you won't hurt David.

33:13.857 --> 33:15.558
Like you did?

33:15.626 --> 33:17.160
Yeah.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.464
He's been through enough.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.500
He doesn't need you
pretending to like him

33:22.568 --> 33:24.201
just to get back at me.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.405
Who's pretending? I do like him.

33:26.472 --> 33:28.707
Fine.

33:28.775 --> 33:30.243
Fine.

33:30.311 --> 33:33.613
"Fine." "Fine." No.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.081
No! It's not fine! It's not fine!

33:36.149 --> 33:37.849
What is wrong with you two?!

33:37.917 --> 33:40.184
I'm happy. Quinn's happy.
What do you want, Haley?

33:40.252 --> 33:42.419
I want you to admit that you're a bitch!

33:44.723 --> 33:46.523
That's fair.

33:49.794 --> 33:51.861
Fine. I'm a bitch.

33:54.864 --> 33:56.831
Fine.

33:59.067 --> 34:00.234
What's going on?

34:00.301 --> 34:02.002
I don't know, but they're not trying

34:02.070 --> 34:03.738
to kill each other anymore, so...

34:03.806 --> 34:05.110
That's good, right?

34:05.177 --> 34:07.348
If those three can work
through their differences,

34:07.416 --> 34:08.817
then maybe...

34:08.885 --> 34:11.655
Not a chance.

34:26.306 --> 34:27.541
Millie.

34:29.078 --> 34:31.547
You holding up okay?

34:33.248 --> 34:35.315
I'm getting there.

34:35.384 --> 34:37.217
Marvin came back last night.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.319
That's great.

34:39.386 --> 34:41.289
It must be hard to see him

34:41.356 --> 34:43.924
after everything that's happened.

34:43.992 --> 34:47.031
It is.

34:49.001 --> 34:51.105
But it was harder not seeing him.

34:52.777 --> 34:53.676
Millie?

34:58.147 --> 35:00.214
Can you help me with this?

35:02.084 --> 35:03.450
Sure.

35:10.459 --> 35:12.094
Thanks.

35:27.241 --> 35:28.574
You leaving?

35:28.642 --> 35:31.343
I never should have come.

35:31.410 --> 35:34.579
I'm sorry I lied to you.

35:34.646 --> 35:37.147
I did it 'cause I
wanted you to be happy.

35:41.352 --> 35:43.753
Are you happy?

35:43.820 --> 35:45.554
I'm getting there.

35:47.824 --> 35:49.591
You happy?

35:49.659 --> 35:51.927
I am.

35:57.165 --> 35:58.064
David.

35:59.633 --> 36:01.000
This is yours.

36:04.937 --> 36:08.439
Just maybe don't give it to Taylor.

36:17.081 --> 36:19.147
I'm sorry.

36:19.215 --> 36:20.448
It's okay.

36:22.084 --> 36:24.651
I'll be okay.

36:45.836 --> 36:48.737
You didn't have to do all this.

36:48.805 --> 36:51.539
You shouldn't be living this way.

36:54.576 --> 36:57.010
So, are you leaving soon?

36:57.078 --> 37:00.146
No, I think I'm gonna st for a while.

37:00.214 --> 37:02.582
Really?

37:02.649 --> 37:04.616
Why?

37:04.684 --> 37:08.086
Because you shouldn't be alone.

37:14.759 --> 37:18.228
You really think I'm the best.

37:18.295 --> 37:20.062
Of course you are.

37:20.130 --> 37:22.565
So, let me get this straight.

37:22.632 --> 37:26.202
I'm better than everybody
else on the planet

37:26.269 --> 37:28.771
who could possibly do this job?

37:28.839 --> 37:29.872
That's right.

37:34.077 --> 37:37.379
Well, I guess if I am the best

37:37.446 --> 37:39.312
and you need the best...

37:39.380 --> 37:41.113
Then I have to do it.

37:41.181 --> 37:43.716
It wouldn't be fair otherwise.

37:45.452 --> 37:46.618
When do I start?

37:46.686 --> 37:49.420
As soon as I find a director.

37:49.488 --> 37:51.789
You don't have a director?

37:51.857 --> 37:55.759
Did you hire anyone for this movie?

37:55.827 --> 37:58.195
The last guy didn't work out.

37:59.864 --> 38:01.831
What a shame.

38:01.899 --> 38:04.700
Too bad you don't know anyone who's...

38:04.768 --> 38:06.802
always wanted to direct...

38:06.869 --> 38:10.204
who knows the movie really well.

38:10.272 --> 38:14.908
I'm thinking someone whose
name rhymes with "Shmulian"?

38:16.577 --> 38:17.844
You know anyone like that?

38:20.514 --> 38:22.781
I don't think my dad would go for that.

38:22.849 --> 38:25.018
You know, I've never directed before.

38:25.086 --> 38:26.552
Make him go for it.

38:26.620 --> 38:30.189
Tell him you hired the best
costume designer on the planet,

38:30.256 --> 38:33.091
and she'll only work
with you if you direct.

38:34.426 --> 38:37.194
Because, ps., that's now the deal.

38:38.397 --> 38:41.064
Have your people call my people.

38:55.678 --> 38:57.445
Another blast from your past?

38:57.513 --> 39:01.282
Ah, I had the locks changed today.

39:01.349 --> 39:03.317
Thanks for sticking
with me through dinner.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.452
I know it was a pretty miserable time.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.754
I kind of actually enjoyed it.

39:07.821 --> 39:09.021
Keys to your house, sir.

39:09.089 --> 39:10.923
Thank you very much.

39:10.990 --> 39:15.927
Now you will be the only
person with a key to my house.

39:15.994 --> 39:17.862
You and the maid, that is.

39:17.929 --> 39:20.230
You didn't have to do this.

39:20.298 --> 39:21.965
Yeah, I know, but I
wanted to do something

39:22.033 --> 39:23.466
to show you how important you are to me.

39:23.534 --> 39:24.968
I know I've said it,

39:25.035 --> 39:27.670
but this way, you have proof
in case you ever forget.

39:27.738 --> 39:29.772
I was just lucky I was
able to find a locksmith

39:29.840 --> 39:31.574
on such short notice.

39:31.642 --> 39:34.143
You're about to get even luckier.

39:37.014 --> 39:38.348
Finally.

39:38.415 --> 39:40.083
Can we tell everyone at the next dinner?

39:41.485 --> 39:44.420
Come on.

39:47.557 --> 39:49.790
Thank you, Jessica.

39:52.591 --> 39:53.957
I made a list of directors

39:54.025 --> 39:56.724
who won't mind working
with a suicidal actress

39:56.792 --> 39:59.794
and a psychotic
producer for minimal pay.

39:59.862 --> 40:01.862
I want to direct.

40:03.231 --> 40:05.398
I know this movie, I know
how to deal with Alex,

40:05.466 --> 40:07.033
and I got you to keep me on track.

40:08.568 --> 40:09.835
What do you think?

40:14.473 --> 40:16.574
You were at the top of t list.

40:16.641 --> 40:18.842
We have less than a week before we roll.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.844
Better get to work.

40:20.912 --> 40:23.713
Yes, sir.

40:29.752 --> 40:32.888
I cannot wait to get into bed

40:32.955 --> 40:36.758
and forget about this awful, awful day.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.393
Why? It was a good day.

40:39.461 --> 40:41.862
What was good about it?

40:41.930 --> 40:44.163
Well, of all the crazy drama today,

40:44.231 --> 40:45.631
none of it was ours.

40:45.699 --> 40:48.934
There were no psycho women
stalking me or my family.

40:49.002 --> 40:51.903
There were no contract
problems. There was no Dan.

40:51.971 --> 40:54.472
I'd take a million days like today.

40:54.539 --> 40:57.341
Yeah, I guess you're right.

40:57.408 --> 40:59.109
It was a good day.

41:17.258 --> 41:19.159
Your...

41:19.226 --> 41:21.594
Your family's crazy.

41:21.661 --> 41:23.195
Whatever.

41:23.262 --> 41:25.029
What time does "Scott free" come on?

41:25.097 --> 41:26.463
Oh, nice!

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
