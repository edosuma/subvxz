WEBVTT

00:02.855 --> 00:04.590
Where is it?

00:04.591 --> 00:07.260
Where is it? Eye of Ra.

00:07.261 --> 00:08.993
Ra.

00:12.832 --> 00:16.502
Eye of Newt, Eye of
Wotan, "Eye of the Tiger,"

00:16.503 --> 00:18.671
Come on, Flynn. Think,
think, think, think, think.

00:18.672 --> 00:20.705
Where is it? Where is it? Where?

00:28.168 --> 00:35.093
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

00:39.358 --> 00:40.926
- Eve?
- Flynn.

00:40.927 --> 00:42.361
What is this?

00:42.362 --> 00:44.196
This is an intervention.

00:44.197 --> 00:45.519
What does that even mean?

00:45.520 --> 00:47.667
It means that we think you're in crisis

00:47.668 --> 00:49.402
and that you need immediate care

00:49.403 --> 00:51.971
to restore equilibrium to the
biopsychosocial functioning.

00:51.972 --> 00:54.206
It means you've been a winging sook.

00:54.207 --> 00:55.875
And it's startin' to piss us off.

00:55.876 --> 00:58.010
Actually, no,

00:58.011 --> 01:01.180
it means we care about
you and we're concerned.

01:01.181 --> 01:03.004
Well, I appreciate your
concern for me, but...

01:03.005 --> 01:05.551
We're concerned for the
team, Flynn, for the Library,

01:05.552 --> 01:07.687
which is greater than just you.

01:07.688 --> 01:09.021
Since Charlene's disappearance,

01:09.022 --> 01:10.923
you've changed. You've been...

01:10.924 --> 01:12.758
- Bloody bonkers.
- A little moody.

01:12.759 --> 01:15.227
I was gonna say "reckless."

01:15.228 --> 01:16.429
Reckless.

01:16.430 --> 01:18.071
We never know where
you are half the time,

01:18.072 --> 01:19.272
you blow back in here, you bark orders,

01:19.273 --> 01:20.766
you leave without saying a word.

01:20.767 --> 01:22.568
It looks like you
haven't slept in weeks.

01:22.569 --> 01:26.472
As Guardian, I can't allow an
asset to become a liability.

01:26.473 --> 01:29.575
That's rich. How exactly
have I become a liability?

01:29.576 --> 01:31.310
Glad you asked.

01:31.311 --> 01:34.447
We've compiled what's
called a List of Hurts.

01:34.448 --> 01:38.016
- Who'd like to go first?
- Oh, yeah.

01:45.124 --> 01:49.729
- Hello, my name is Ezekiel.
- Hello, Ezekiel.

01:49.730 --> 01:51.397
Oh, my God.

01:51.398 --> 01:55.334
Flynn, you're always like,
"Ezekiel, do it like this,"

01:55.335 --> 01:57.570
or, "Ezekiel, don't do it like that,"

01:57.571 --> 02:02.208
but what I think you mean
is, "Ezekiel, do it like me."

02:02.209 --> 02:05.778
Yet, ever since I've got here,
things have gone from bad to worse.

02:05.779 --> 02:08.481
What's your point, that you're
bad luck? I would agree with that.

02:08.482 --> 02:12.184
Flynn. It's okay, Ezekiel.
You're doing great.

02:12.185 --> 02:16.822
Ahem, the Library invited
Ezekiel Jones to the Library

02:16.823 --> 02:19.558
because the Library
needed Ezekiel Jones.

02:19.559 --> 02:24.096
I've got my own style. I mean, you
call it juvenile, I call it original.

02:24.097 --> 02:26.098
You say my ideas are half-baked.

02:26.099 --> 02:28.467
I say they're fully baked,
frosted, and ready to serve.

02:28.468 --> 02:31.103
- You say...
- Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto.

02:31.104 --> 02:33.167
Got it. You want to be you?
Let your freak flag fly.

02:33.168 --> 02:36.303
I will not stop you. Next!

02:41.814 --> 02:44.049
I want to start out by saying that
I have a tremendous deal of respect

02:44.050 --> 02:45.891
for you and everything
that you've accomplished

02:45.892 --> 02:47.760
- as a librarian all these years.
- Thank you.

02:47.761 --> 02:50.623
I also think that maybe
you've been so good for so long

02:50.624 --> 02:54.026
that you haven't really noticed that
we're actually pretty good at it, too.

02:54.027 --> 02:56.395
I think that is true, thank you.

02:56.396 --> 02:58.431
- Next.
- Nope.

02:58.432 --> 03:02.368
It's just important to you to be
right and first all of the time

03:02.369 --> 03:05.404
and that makes you
competitive and intimidating,

03:05.405 --> 03:08.274
and sometimes when I have a
solution, I'm afraid to speak up

03:08.275 --> 03:10.376
because you can be dismissive,

03:10.377 --> 03:12.745
and then we all have
to sit around and wait

03:12.746 --> 03:16.248
for you to come up with an
idea, and that can be... awkward.

03:16.249 --> 03:18.751
So I'm an insensitive bully
who's slowing you down.

03:18.752 --> 03:22.453
No, you are a gifted leader, Flynn,
but you're not the only one with a gift.

03:24.356 --> 03:26.358
We're not the enemy.

03:26.359 --> 03:28.459
We're teammates.

03:30.930 --> 03:33.031
Okay, that's all I wanted to say.

03:37.603 --> 03:39.004
I feel a little silly doing this.

03:39.005 --> 03:41.073
Good. You should.

03:41.074 --> 03:44.610
You know what? I thought I
was tough to get to know, okay?

03:44.611 --> 03:46.479
My walls up, always on my guard.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.381
But, man, you're like
Fort Knox compared to me.

03:49.382 --> 03:51.250
Well, Fort Knocks isn't
all that impenetrable.

03:51.251 --> 03:52.684
I mean, twice, I...

03:54.053 --> 03:56.187
right, sorry. Carry on.

03:58.958 --> 04:01.126
I never know where I stand with you.

04:01.127 --> 04:03.128
I mean, one day, we got a lot in common,

04:03.129 --> 04:05.598
the next day, it's like
we gotta start over.

04:05.599 --> 04:07.933
I like you as a person.

04:07.934 --> 04:11.337
I think you're a hell of a Librarian.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.906
You don't know much about friendship.

04:13.907 --> 04:18.043
C.S. Lewis said,
"Friendship is unnecessary,

04:18.043 --> 04:22.548
like philosophy, like art.
It has no survival value.

04:22.549 --> 04:25.551
Rather, it is one of the things

04:25.552 --> 04:28.754
which give value to survival."

04:28.755 --> 04:30.923
What we're facing, man,

04:30.924 --> 04:35.526
it's like friendship may be
our only shot at survival.

04:43.335 --> 04:44.669
Ahem.

04:50.342 --> 04:54.113
I think what hurts most
is knowing what a wonderful

04:54.114 --> 04:58.284
leader, teacher, friend,
and partner you can be,

04:58.285 --> 05:01.587
but also knowing how insanely
self-destructive you are.

05:01.588 --> 05:05.858
Your moods, your impulsiveness,
your secrecy, your pride

05:05.859 --> 05:08.460
may have served you in the past,

05:08.461 --> 05:13.632
but now they're only impeding
your progress as a Librarian,

05:13.633 --> 05:17.236
as a partner, as a friend,

05:17.237 --> 05:19.971
as a man.

05:22.374 --> 05:24.777
Wow.

05:24.778 --> 05:27.313
What a bunch of crap.

05:27.314 --> 05:31.116
You've all obviously forgotten
two significant things.

05:31.117 --> 05:34.753
One... no handcuffs can hold me.

05:34.754 --> 05:38.057
Number two... whoa!

05:38.058 --> 05:39.691
Yeah, we didn't forget.

05:41.327 --> 05:44.630
And, two, nothing is more important

05:44.631 --> 05:46.298
than the containment of pure evil

05:46.299 --> 05:48.434
and the preservation of this Library.

05:48.435 --> 05:52.171
Not family, not friends,

05:52.172 --> 05:54.406
and certainly not feelings.

05:54.407 --> 05:57.676
We are at war, people,
the proverbial end of days,

05:57.677 --> 05:59.237
and if I hadn't made that clear to you,

05:59.238 --> 06:00.838
it's because I thought we had more time.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.114
But with Apep on the loose,

06:02.115 --> 06:04.049
what should be taking
centuries is taking weeks.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.185
The world is literally leaking evil

06:06.186 --> 06:08.053
like water through a sieve.

06:08.054 --> 06:10.155
And in my search for Charlene,

06:10.156 --> 06:12.024
I may have identified the one artifact

06:12.025 --> 06:14.259
which may stem the tide.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.762
And while you've all
been tucked away here

06:16.763 --> 06:19.798
fist bumping each other,
inventorying your hurts.

06:19.799 --> 06:21.934
I've actually been out
there looking for it!

06:21.935 --> 06:24.003
Well, if you'd told us
that's what you were doing

06:24.004 --> 06:27.339
- or what you were looking for...
- The Eye of Ra!

06:27.340 --> 06:29.731
- The Eye of Ra?
- Where was it last seen?

06:29.732 --> 06:31.715
- What does it look like?
- Do you have any clues?

06:31.716 --> 06:33.779
It was last seen in the
library of Alexandria.

06:33.780 --> 06:36.115
It looks like a piece
of 1970s disco bling

06:36.116 --> 06:38.283
and at the moment, I haven't a clue.

06:38.284 --> 06:40.853
All right, well, most of the
excavations done in Alexandria

06:40.854 --> 06:44.356
were done by a Sir Flinders
Petrie, 19th Century.

06:44.357 --> 06:46.740
Maybe we should check the
British Museum of Natural History.

06:46.741 --> 06:50.295
I tried it. Most of the Petrie
collection disappeared in March of 1886.

06:50.296 --> 06:52.297
- How?
- Stolen.

06:52.298 --> 06:54.081
Besides a Librarian,
who'd want a bunch of...

06:54.082 --> 06:56.235
Hey, who was the Librarian in 1886?

06:56.236 --> 06:59.071
Teddy Chislington, one
of my heroes, actually.

06:59.072 --> 07:02.241
Mathematician, scholar,
poet, adventurer, bon vivant.

07:02.242 --> 07:04.443
From Louis Pasteur to Lewis Carroll,

07:04.444 --> 07:06.679
from Dickens to Darwin,
he knew them all.

07:06.680 --> 07:11.016
Now, he was a Librarian. Jenkins,
missed you at the intervention.

07:11.017 --> 07:15.220
Yes, wow, did I just hear you
guys mention Teddy Chislington?

07:15.221 --> 07:18.691
- Yeah, did you know him?
- Oh, yes, yes, just a brilliant chap.

07:18.692 --> 07:20.659
Devoted to the Library.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.562
Lived a little high, burning his
candle at both ends, as it were.

07:23.563 --> 07:26.198
- But what a lovely light.
- What happened to him?

07:26.199 --> 07:28.801
Well, he along with 88 other poor souls

07:28.802 --> 07:31.437
went down aboard the doomed ship Tibbar,

07:31.438 --> 07:36.241
bound for New York, lost off the
Atlantic Coast June 4th, 1886.

07:36.242 --> 07:37.233
1886?

07:37.234 --> 07:39.645
That's when the Petrie
collection disappeared.

07:39.646 --> 07:42.481
June 4th, 1886. Why do I know that date?

07:42.482 --> 07:46.151
Ooh, it was the perfect storm, a
combination of three major hurricanes,

07:46.152 --> 07:47.886
one of the worst storms ever recorded.

07:47.887 --> 07:49.822
Wind speeds of up to 155 miles an hour.

07:49.823 --> 07:54.193
Here it is. The Tibbar, last set
sail from Southampton, England,

07:54.194 --> 07:57.496
bound for New York on May 20th, 1886.

07:57.497 --> 07:59.398
Unknown.

07:59.399 --> 08:00.766
Sounds like Teddy Chislington

08:00.767 --> 08:02.201
was bringing the Petrie collection

08:02.202 --> 08:04.236
and the Eye of Ra home to the Library.

08:04.237 --> 08:07.039
Well, it takes 15 days to make
the western voyage under mast.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.841
You said they left the 20th of May,

08:08.842 --> 08:10.909
you said they disappeared
the 4th of June.

08:10.910 --> 08:13.746
That's 15 days. They almost made it.

08:13.747 --> 08:17.216
Yes, indeed, but certainly the storm
would've blown them far south of New York.

08:17.217 --> 08:22.154
Right, so we take the tonnage
of the ship, its average speed

08:22.155 --> 08:25.257
under normal conditions,
and then we factor in

08:25.258 --> 08:29.061
currents and wind speeds of
the three converging storms.

08:29.062 --> 08:31.130
Coordinates would've been
dramatically different.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.798
It looks like it would've gone down

08:32.799 --> 08:36.934
at a latitude of 26.38 north

08:36.936 --> 08:40.205
and a longitude of 69.395 west.

08:40.206 --> 08:41.273
Where is that?

08:41.274 --> 08:45.444
The exact center of
the Bermuda Triangle.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.012
Just as I almost suspected.

08:47.013 --> 08:48.213
The Bermuda Triangle?

08:48.214 --> 08:50.015
Like, the Bermuda Triangle?

08:50.016 --> 08:51.850
- That's real?
- 'Course it is.

08:51.851 --> 08:55.754
- Electric fog? The Hutchinson Effect.
- No, it's sea serpents.

08:55.755 --> 08:58.056
Guys, it's actually underwater
methane gas explosions.

08:58.057 --> 08:59.566
- Researchers recently discovered...
- Don't be stupid.

08:59.567 --> 09:00.558
It's none of those things.

09:00.559 --> 09:01.815
Remember when I said
that you were dismissive?

09:01.816 --> 09:04.464
The Bermuda Triangle, for all of
your information, is a worm hole

09:04.465 --> 09:06.265
with two significant major differences:

09:06.266 --> 09:08.634
number one... things go
in but they don't come out,

09:08.635 --> 09:10.602
and number two... it is
totally unpredictable.

09:10.603 --> 09:12.504
You never know when it is going to open.

09:16.308 --> 09:19.411
"Bermuda Triangle claims
Venezuelan Airliner."

09:19.412 --> 09:22.047
- This is dated tomorrow.
- Make that one major difference.

09:22.048 --> 09:23.549
We need to be on that plane.

09:23.550 --> 09:25.651
Five beautifully forged
identities coming right up.

09:25.652 --> 09:29.488
I will find a way to ride a
crashing airliner into a worm hole.

09:29.489 --> 09:32.024
I'll turn my attention on
finding you a way back, sir.

09:32.025 --> 09:33.770
I'm gonna check the
archive on the triangle,

09:33.771 --> 09:35.371
see if I can find any patterns or clues.

09:35.395 --> 09:37.062
Anything on the Eye of Ra.

09:37.063 --> 09:39.565
That's what teamwork looks like, Flynn.

09:39.566 --> 09:41.066
In case you've forgotten.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.935
Traversing a non-traversable worm hole

09:42.936 --> 09:45.037
is physically impossible, Eve.

09:45.038 --> 09:47.139
And even if it weren't impossible,

09:47.140 --> 09:48.874
there's a good reason
why, for centuries,

09:48.875 --> 09:51.976
it's been called the Devil's Triangle!

09:58.486 --> 10:00.021
Status report?

10:00.022 --> 10:01.789
Ah, uh, nearly finished.

10:01.790 --> 10:05.126
Miniature version of the apparatus
that powers our back door.

10:05.127 --> 10:08.429
Light enough to travel, unfortunately
storage capacity is very limited.

10:08.430 --> 10:11.299
- Meaning?
- It will only work once.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.435
So, please use extreme caution.
You won't get a second chance.

10:14.436 --> 10:16.804
Noted. Cassandra, what you got?

10:16.805 --> 10:18.673
I got an idea, but you're gonna hate it.

10:18.674 --> 10:21.509
Here you go, Colonel. Cassandra.

10:21.510 --> 10:23.211
Who's Olga Medvidev?

10:23.212 --> 10:26.347
You are. I've given us all
aliases to keep DOSA off our tales.

10:26.348 --> 10:28.883
Good job, Jones. Give Jenkins a hand.

10:28.884 --> 10:30.159
Go on.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.888
So, worm holes, by design,
are structurally unstable.

10:33.889 --> 10:37.291
To travel in both directions,
creating a transversable worm hole,

10:37.292 --> 10:40.294
we need stabilization from exotic
matter with a negative density.

10:40.295 --> 10:44.499
Now, theoretical physics offers
up exotic baryons, quark-gluon,

10:44.500 --> 10:46.300
even dark matter as a possible solution,

10:46.301 --> 10:48.970
but, like I said, those
are all still theoretical.

10:48.971 --> 10:50.171
So...

10:50.172 --> 10:52.740
So thanks to Jenkins,
we can get out alive,

10:52.741 --> 10:55.176
but thanks to physics,
we can't get in alive.

10:55.177 --> 10:56.911
Exactly.

10:56.912 --> 10:59.112
Why don't we just make
ourselves the exotic matter?

11:01.249 --> 11:05.286
Well, you know, sprinkle a
little pixie dust on a Tic Tac,

11:05.287 --> 11:07.822
pop it down the gullet, and voila.

11:07.823 --> 11:10.925
Magic. We use bloody magic to
make ourselves transversable.

11:10.926 --> 11:13.995
No, absolutely not. No magic Tic Tacs.

11:13.996 --> 11:16.931
We have other options. What
was the idea you said I'd hate?

11:16.932 --> 11:18.566
Magic Tic Tacs.

11:18.567 --> 11:20.902
Oh, come on, guys.

11:20.903 --> 11:22.670
I have to agree with the colonel.

11:22.671 --> 11:25.706
And what powers this, Jenkins?
Baking soda and dreams?

11:25.707 --> 11:27.809
- It's different.
- How?

11:27.810 --> 11:30.278
Known quantities, known
formulas, known outcome.

11:30.279 --> 11:32.513
You're suggesting something
unproven and untried.

11:32.514 --> 11:34.849
Well, so has anyone who
has tried anything new

11:34.850 --> 11:36.484
in the history of doing things.

11:36.485 --> 11:38.886
Eve, the limitations of known science

11:38.887 --> 11:40.721
do put us at a disadvantage.

11:40.722 --> 11:42.690
I mean, if this really
is the end of days,

11:42.691 --> 11:45.193
then we need every option on the table.

11:45.194 --> 11:49.397
Every arrow in our quiver, every
tool in our chest, every ace up our...

11:49.398 --> 11:51.332
Okay, we get the point.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.000
Magic Tic Tacs it is.

11:53.001 --> 11:55.670
There you are, guys. Stop what
you're doing and come with me.

11:55.671 --> 11:58.138
I gotta show you something really weird.

12:00.641 --> 12:04.512
Once I was able to weed out all the
crank cases and debunk a few of the myths,

12:04.513 --> 12:06.414
I was able to tabulate a list

12:06.415 --> 12:08.816
of all the known disappearing ships

12:08.817 --> 12:11.052
within the borders of the triangle.

12:11.053 --> 12:12.386
How many?

12:12.387 --> 12:16.891
With Venezuelan Airline, it's 108.

12:16.892 --> 12:18.960
What's so weird about that?

12:18.961 --> 12:21.062
This.

12:21.063 --> 12:23.865
When you write down all of
the names of the missing ships

12:23.866 --> 12:26.400
and the dates when they
disappeared in chronological order

12:26.401 --> 12:29.604
starting with Teddy
Chislington's ship, the Tibbar,

12:29.605 --> 12:33.508
listen. Listen to this.

12:33.509 --> 12:37.745
1886, the Tibbar. 1894, the Loon,

12:37.746 --> 12:42.416
1899, The Black Rose,
1910, The Queen's Moon,

12:42.417 --> 12:46.988
1918, Cyclops, 1920, Monsoon.

12:46.989 --> 12:48.422
So, they rhyme.

12:48.423 --> 12:49.724
But that's not all, all right?

12:49.725 --> 12:53.461
The rhyme scheme of A-B-C-B-D-B

12:53.462 --> 12:56.497
and the syllable structure of 8-6-8-6

12:56.498 --> 12:58.499
stays constant throughout.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.701
So you're saying it's not random.

13:00.702 --> 13:03.604
The Bermuda Triangle
chooses specific ships

13:03.605 --> 13:07.074
with dates that fit
the pattern of a poem?

13:07.075 --> 13:09.610
- Exactly.
- A poem?

13:09.611 --> 13:12.513
About what, a bunch of
innocent people lost at sea?

13:12.514 --> 13:14.348
Loss of innocence.

13:14.349 --> 13:16.350
Hold that thought.

13:16.351 --> 13:20.521
108 lines. One for every ship.

13:20.522 --> 13:24.892
18 stanzas, one for every
decade a ship went missing.

13:24.893 --> 13:26.928
There is only one poem
in the English language

13:26.929 --> 13:29.564
that fits that exact structure,

13:29.565 --> 13:33.901
and it is unquestionably
about loss of innocence.

13:33.902 --> 13:38.105
"The time has come, the walrus
said, to talk of many things,

13:38.106 --> 13:42.743
of shoes and ships and sealing
wax, of cabbages and kings."

13:42.744 --> 13:45.346
"And why the sea is boiling hot

13:45.347 --> 13:48.015
and whether pigs have wings."

13:48.016 --> 13:50.484
Lewis Carroll's "The
Walrus and the Carpenter."

13:50.485 --> 13:56.157
But what does this have to do
with the worm hole hourglass thing?

13:56.158 --> 13:58.392
I do not know.

13:58.393 --> 14:00.861
And isn't that fantastic?

14:00.862 --> 14:04.465
It's a riddle. Let's
fire up the back door.

14:04.466 --> 14:06.867
We're late. We're late
for a very important date.

14:06.868 --> 14:09.070
In Venezuela.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:19.513 --> 14:21.415
- Argh. La maldicion!
- What is it?

14:21.416 --> 14:23.250
It means, "Argh! Damn it!" in Spanish.

14:23.251 --> 14:24.619
No, I mean, what's the problem?

14:24.620 --> 14:26.120
Well, Jenkins' calibrations were off.

14:26.121 --> 14:27.788
We're on the wrong side of security.

14:27.789 --> 14:29.457
I have a brand-new
nail clipper in my bag

14:29.458 --> 14:31.659
that they are gonna confiscate for sure.

14:31.660 --> 14:34.428
I think we're gonna have
a bigger problem with this.

14:34.429 --> 14:36.697
Good point.

14:36.698 --> 14:39.105
Ezekiel, can you jam
the x-ray long enough to

14:39.106 --> 14:41.569
get the duffel through
the conveyer undetected?

14:41.570 --> 14:44.372
Does a wombat's grumpy come out cubed?

14:44.373 --> 14:46.340
- I have no idea.
- It does.

14:46.341 --> 14:47.942
Good.

14:47.943 --> 14:50.344
Cassandra, you and Stone take
the duffel and the mission bags

14:50.345 --> 14:52.928
and start passing them through
when Ezekiel gives you the signal.

14:52.929 --> 14:55.182
- What about the guards?
- Distraction. My specialty.

14:55.183 --> 14:58.319
Eve, you're with me. The three of
you hang back until things heat up,

14:58.320 --> 15:00.488
then pass the stuff.
We'll meet at the gate.

15:00.489 --> 15:02.923
Heat... what do you mean by heat up?

15:02.924 --> 15:04.925
I'm not... I don't...

15:09.830 --> 15:12.867
Ay.

15:12.868 --> 15:16.470
You speaking to me? Afraid I don't
understand. I don't speak Spanish.

15:16.471 --> 15:18.272
Honey, what is he saying?

15:18.273 --> 15:20.241
He wants to know if this is your bag.

15:20.242 --> 15:23.544
Ah, yes. Is there a problem?

15:23.545 --> 15:25.713
What is the problem?

15:25.714 --> 15:29.583
He's saying you can't bring
your nail clippers onboard.

15:29.584 --> 15:33.888
What? What?! Are you
joking?! This is insane!

15:33.889 --> 15:35.356
Señor, cálmese, por favor.

15:35.357 --> 15:37.358
Yeah, honey, calm down.

15:37.359 --> 15:40.382
Don't tell me to calm down. You've been
like a wet blanket this entire trip!

15:40.383 --> 15:42.229
Uh, well...

15:42.230 --> 15:46.400
you said this trip was gonna be fun!

15:46.401 --> 15:49.036
You said it was gonna
be dinner and dancing,

15:49.037 --> 15:51.739
and it's been just run,
run, run, run, museum,

15:51.740 --> 15:53.507
gallery, run, run, run, run...

15:53.508 --> 15:55.843
Here we go with the
run, run, run, run, run.

15:55.844 --> 15:59.447
Yes, I know you would love it if I
stayed home with you and the kids,

15:59.448 --> 16:01.949
but I have actual responsibilities.

16:01.950 --> 16:05.086
You think it's easy taking
care of three kids with no help?

16:05.087 --> 16:08.022
You get to come and go as you
please, show up whenever you want,

16:08.023 --> 16:10.526
and expect us to stop everything
and follow your every command?

16:10.527 --> 16:12.893
Yes, okay, I have a few
faults, and thank God that I do,

16:12.894 --> 16:15.796
otherwise you wouldn't have anything
to act morally superior about.

16:15.797 --> 16:19.800
At least I'm consistent! Someone
has to be the pillar, the anchor!

16:19.801 --> 16:21.869
The ball and chain?!

16:21.870 --> 16:23.971
When have I ever slowed you down?

16:23.972 --> 16:26.574
When have I ever stopped you?

16:26.575 --> 16:29.678
I never pretended to be anything other
than what I am and you used to love it!

16:29.679 --> 16:33.080
Remember, Eve? Sunbathing on
the red desert sands of Tunisia?

16:33.081 --> 16:34.348
I got third degree burns.

16:34.349 --> 16:36.183
Skin diving in the canals of Venice?

16:36.184 --> 16:38.085
Amoebic dysentery.

16:38.086 --> 16:40.254
It was worth it.

16:40.255 --> 16:42.123
Or maybe it wasn't.

16:42.124 --> 16:44.347
Maybe it was a mistake for
us to get personally involved

16:44.348 --> 16:47.194
in the beginning. I don't know.

16:47.195 --> 16:48.896
Is that really how you feel?

16:48.897 --> 16:51.699
This isn't about my feelings.
This is about your feelings.

16:51.700 --> 16:55.935
How do you want me, Eve? I'm
either a screw-up or I'm a hero.

16:55.936 --> 16:58.105
So, choose. How do you want me?

16:58.106 --> 16:59.707
I want you to be a hero.

16:59.708 --> 17:01.708
Then start looking at me that way again.

17:07.414 --> 17:10.483
And how exactly do you feel about me?

17:10.484 --> 17:13.487
You don't know?

17:13.488 --> 17:16.891
Eve, from the moment I laid eyes on you

17:16.892 --> 17:20.694
in that German steam
tunnel I've loved you.

17:20.694 --> 17:23.864
I love you more than
anyone I've ever known.

17:23.865 --> 17:27.468
More than anything I've ever learned.

17:27.469 --> 17:29.335
I love you more than learning itself.

17:44.752 --> 17:47.421
Tell him he can keep the nail clippers.

17:47.422 --> 17:50.156
_

17:56.897 --> 17:58.365
We made it.

17:58.366 --> 17:59.733
With time to spare.

17:59.734 --> 18:01.202
Everyone have their magic Tic Tacs?

18:01.203 --> 18:03.304
Or negative matter
catalytic conversion tablets?

18:03.305 --> 18:04.705
Yes.

18:04.706 --> 18:07.707
- Have we forgotten anything?
- Not a thing.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.215
Bienvenidos.

18:14.216 --> 18:17.184
I think we forgot about 140 things.

18:17.185 --> 18:19.654
We definitely don't have
enough Tic Tacs for everybody.

18:19.655 --> 18:20.439
How did we do that?

18:20.440 --> 18:22.624
The Clipping Book didn't say
anything about passengers.

18:22.625 --> 18:26.360
- What's our next move?
- Take our seats.

18:26.361 --> 18:28.328
Con permiso. Con permiso.

18:32.558 --> 18:35.494
We have to reassess.
You have a plan, right?

18:35.495 --> 18:37.329
Um, sort of.

18:37.330 --> 18:39.258
This changes everything.
We've got to get the passengers

18:39.259 --> 18:40.922
off this plane before
we hit the triangle.

18:40.923 --> 18:42.501
The Eye of Ra will have to wait.

18:42.502 --> 18:44.062
The triangle's window is unpredictable.

18:44.086 --> 18:45.571
We may never get another chance.

18:45.572 --> 18:47.005
Stone, what do you think?

18:47.006 --> 18:50.476
I can't believe that
sneaky son of a bitch.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.544
- What?
- Ezekiel.

18:52.545 --> 18:55.581
He forged himself a first-class
ticket and stuck us back here in coach.

18:55.582 --> 18:57.149
Focus! We don't have time for this.

18:57.150 --> 18:58.717
I agree with Baird.

18:58.718 --> 19:00.158
We've got to turn this thing around.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.121
- Yes!
- You agree?

19:02.122 --> 19:03.989
No. No, but look.

19:03.990 --> 19:07.392
They have the exact same nail
clippers in the in-flight magazine.

19:07.393 --> 19:09.328
How lucky is that?

19:09.329 --> 19:14.099
I mean, obviously, I can't order
them now, but if we survive.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.668
You're serious? That's what
you're thinking about right now?

19:16.669 --> 19:21.039
Yeah, and I was going
to order myself a Fanta,

19:21.040 --> 19:23.575
which is by far my
favorite orange beverage.

19:23.576 --> 19:25.310
Very popular in South America.

19:25.311 --> 19:28.014
And I was gonna ask the stewardess
to bring me some before we crash.

19:28.015 --> 19:30.649
- Okay, that's it. You're coming with me.
- Ah! Ah!

19:35.187 --> 19:37.890
Explain yourself. There
are innocent people

19:37.891 --> 19:39.791
on this plane who could get hurt.

19:39.792 --> 19:42.594
Don't be naive, Eve. Innocent
people are already getting hurt.

19:42.595 --> 19:44.663
And more will, too,
if we don't stop Apep.

19:44.664 --> 19:46.565
Logic clearly dictates

19:46.566 --> 19:48.629
the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

19:48.630 --> 19:49.768
Okay, who said that, Plato?

19:49.769 --> 19:52.037
No, Spock in "Star Trek
II: The Wrath of Khan,"

19:52.038 --> 19:54.181
but I think it's still true.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

19:54.182 --> 19:55.774
You are not walking away again.

19:55.775 --> 19:58.710
Oh, really? Well, bring it.
I'd like to see you... ah!

19:58.711 --> 20:01.413
Ah! Ow! Uncle! Uncle!

20:01.414 --> 20:05.817
Uncle Uncle!

20:05.818 --> 20:09.287
The pain clear your head? Are you ready
to tell me what's going on with you?

20:11.156 --> 20:12.957
Ah.

20:14.459 --> 20:17.194
I've been a fool.

20:19.064 --> 20:22.167
First Dulaque released
magic back into the world,

20:22.168 --> 20:24.369
and then Prospero
supercharged the ley lines,

20:24.370 --> 20:26.738
and now Apep is using those
ley lines like the Autobahn

20:26.739 --> 20:30.509
to drive pure evil back into the
world and it's all been on my watch.

20:30.510 --> 20:31.910
Our watch.

20:31.911 --> 20:34.012
It's too big for one Librarian to stop,

20:34.013 --> 20:36.515
so stop trying to fix it alone.

20:36.516 --> 20:38.150
You're pushing us away. Why?

20:38.151 --> 20:40.385
Because this is different.

20:40.386 --> 20:43.222
I've been out there looking for Charlene
and I've seen what pure evil can do.

20:43.223 --> 20:45.023
It comes on like a wave
as seductive as love

20:45.024 --> 20:47.226
and leaves a wake of broken
bodies, broken spirits,

20:47.227 --> 20:48.827
broken hearts, and pain.

20:48.828 --> 20:51.630
The kind of pain that makes
death look like a blessing.

20:57.769 --> 21:01.339
- What was that?
- Uh, nothing good.

21:03.242 --> 21:04.843
Oh, decide to come
back here and join us?

21:04.844 --> 21:06.324
Felt it all the way up there, did ya?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.981
Uh, sure did. Spilled
champagne all over myself.

21:08.982 --> 21:11.049
And that's not even the half of it.

21:11.050 --> 21:12.751
Where's Flynn and Eve?

21:12.752 --> 21:15.187
Really?

21:15.188 --> 21:19.890
In the middle of a mission? Are they...
anyway, you two need to come see this.

21:22.928 --> 21:25.564
Let's go. We should be
approaching the triangle.

21:25.565 --> 21:27.228
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, I'm serious.

21:27.229 --> 21:30.002
From now on, happy endings
are not on the table.

21:30.003 --> 21:33.672
The choices are gonna be between
horrible and the unthinkable.

21:33.673 --> 21:36.808
I know, but I also know you.

21:36.809 --> 21:41.045
And I know you wouldn't let an innocent
person suffer if there's an alternative.

21:42.514 --> 21:44.682
So you always find one.

21:51.923 --> 21:53.659
There were people and seats in here.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.360
That's definitely not good.

21:55.361 --> 21:58.796
The pilots. Go.

22:09.809 --> 22:11.843
- Crikey.
- Oh, man.

22:11.844 --> 22:13.078
Oh.

22:13.079 --> 22:15.413
Either one of you know
how to fly a plane?

22:22.309 --> 22:25.946
Ah! Ah!

22:28.950 --> 22:32.318
If you two are done having fun, we
could really use your help up front.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.864
- Where are the pilots?
- Gone, poof.

22:43.865 --> 22:46.099
Trying to find the autopilot.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.961
You're not really willing to let
all these people die, are you, Flynn?

22:49.803 --> 22:52.706
- No.
- I didn't think so.

22:52.707 --> 22:54.307
Stone, Cassandra, take the magical door,

22:54.308 --> 22:55.926
set it up in the back,
evacuate everyone.

22:55.927 --> 22:57.943
Ezekiel and I will take over up here.

23:05.018 --> 23:07.020
- Flynn?
- I know, I know, calm the passengers.

23:07.021 --> 23:11.157
No, I was going to say do you or do
you not know how to speak Spanish?

23:11.158 --> 23:14.861
Eve, two of my PhDs are in 15th
and 17th century Spanish literature.

23:14.862 --> 23:17.597
I translated "Don Quixote"
myself when I was 12...

23:17.598 --> 23:19.232
I get it. Calm everyone down.

23:19.233 --> 23:21.067
Right.

23:21.068 --> 23:22.769
Careful.

23:22.770 --> 23:24.271
Calling Air Traffic Control.

23:24.272 --> 23:27.641
Mayday, Mayday, this is
Air Marahuaca, Flight 77.

23:27.642 --> 23:29.643
We are going down! I
repeat, we are going...

23:29.644 --> 23:32.945
Ezekiel! That's the plane's intercom!

24:06.413 --> 24:10.483
I know... well, I know some Spanish, and
that definitely ain't from this century.

24:10.484 --> 24:13.954
Whatever it is, it seems to be working.

24:13.955 --> 24:16.656
Okay, I think I've almost
got it ready to crank up.

24:16.657 --> 24:18.124
Remember, we can only use this once.

24:21.696 --> 24:23.596
Put your hands in the air!

24:23.597 --> 24:26.833
- Step away from the door.
- Put the gun down, man.

24:26.834 --> 24:29.502
Special Agent Sam Linsky,
Department of Statistical Anomalies.

24:29.503 --> 24:34.040
I have orders to shoot if you attempt
to harm these passengers in any way.

24:34.041 --> 24:37.377
Sir, this isn't what it looks like.

24:37.378 --> 24:39.646
I will not warn you again.

24:39.647 --> 24:41.715
Hold onto something.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.595
Warning.

24:55.596 --> 24:57.731
Strong warning. Strong warning.

24:57.732 --> 25:00.800
- Strong warning.
- Time to go.

25:00.801 --> 25:04.270
We need everyone off this plane now!

25:04.271 --> 25:07.206
Cassandra, show 'em it's safe!

25:09.009 --> 25:10.543
Watch me!

25:13.180 --> 25:15.482
Ezekiel, you, too!

25:15.483 --> 25:18.051
You don't have to tell me twice! Whoo!

25:19.987 --> 25:22.334
_

25:22.484 --> 25:23.869
_

25:24.993 --> 25:27.096
_

25:32.032 --> 25:34.434
Miss Cillian, what are you doing here?

25:34.435 --> 25:37.404
Um...

25:37.405 --> 25:39.271
Hey.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.276
Go! Go! Andale! Andale!

25:43.277 --> 25:44.844
Go, people! Go back there!

25:44.845 --> 25:48.882
Do something, Flynn! Help me
get these people out of here!

25:48.883 --> 25:52.651
Be the hero I know you are.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.622
There's the look.

25:55.623 --> 25:57.323
Okay, I may know
something that might work.

25:57.324 --> 25:59.918
Uh... _,

26:00.294 --> 26:01.345
_

26:02.069 --> 26:04.443
_

26:05.254 --> 26:06.229
_

26:06.699 --> 26:08.639
_

26:08.640 --> 26:11.631
_

26:12.075 --> 26:13.802
_

26:14.455 --> 26:16.395
_

26:17.383 --> 26:18.470
_

26:18.876 --> 26:20.003
_

26:26.553 --> 26:28.154
That's some magic trick.

26:28.155 --> 26:30.056
It's actually an old
stage hypnosis technique

26:30.057 --> 26:31.925
developed by Houdini.

26:31.926 --> 26:34.027
I think they'll be a lot
easier to round up now.

26:34.028 --> 26:36.129
Stone, let's go to it!

26:36.130 --> 26:38.031
Uh, hep! Hep! Hep!

26:38.032 --> 26:40.366
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

26:47.141 --> 26:48.441
Oh. Oh, boy.

26:48.442 --> 26:50.176
Oh, boy. Okay, uh...

26:50.177 --> 26:52.412
I don't... yes, come this way.

26:52.413 --> 26:53.880
Right this way. Uh, okay.

26:53.881 --> 26:55.682
No, no, no, there you go, there you go.

26:55.683 --> 26:58.650
Nice piggies. Um...

27:00.320 --> 27:02.655
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

27:13.066 --> 27:14.567
I'll be right behind you.

27:14.568 --> 27:16.402
I promise, Flynn, we're
dong the right thing.

27:16.403 --> 27:18.204
We will find the Eye of Ra.

27:18.205 --> 27:19.938
I know we will.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.941
Go!

27:36.189 --> 27:38.158
Colonel Baird.

27:38.159 --> 27:39.625
Where's Mr. Carsen?

28:31.817 --> 28:33.486
Ha! Rabbit.

28:33.487 --> 28:37.456
Bermuda Triangle's not
an hourglass worm hole,

28:37.457 --> 28:39.692
it's a looking glass rabbit hole.

28:39.693 --> 28:43.329
Some sort of Lewis Carroll inspired,
extra-dimensional magical safe

28:43.330 --> 28:47.266
designed to keep the Eye of Ra
from falling into the wrong hands.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.835
And I'm talking to myself.

28:58.245 --> 29:00.412
"If seven maids with seven mops

29:00.413 --> 29:01.914
swept it for half a year,

29:01.915 --> 29:06.418
do you suppose it's possible
they could make it clear?"

29:06.419 --> 29:09.221
"I doubt it," said the
carpenter, and shed a bitter tear.

29:09.222 --> 29:10.422
Jenkins.

29:10.423 --> 29:15.194
No, not Jenkins. Who are you?

29:15.195 --> 29:17.763
We have not met. And yet we have.

29:17.764 --> 29:23.469
For All who seek the Eye have a certain
air about them as telling as a lie.

29:23.470 --> 29:27.273
They swear that they're never
wrong right up until they die.

29:27.274 --> 29:30.442
So the Eye of Ra's here? Fantastic!

29:30.443 --> 29:32.411
Okay, what do I have to do?

29:32.412 --> 29:34.914
There is a game designed to
tell the learned from the fool.

29:34.915 --> 29:39.218
Whether you crave golden glory
or live by the Golden Rule.

29:39.219 --> 29:42.721
To see if you possess the knowledge
that can't be learned in school.

29:42.722 --> 29:44.924
This sounds like fun. How do we start?

29:44.925 --> 29:48.527
The Chessboard in the Rose Garden
is where the game is played.

29:48.528 --> 29:50.262
- But watch out...
- Okay, got it.

29:50.263 --> 29:52.697
Which way is the chess board?

29:57.236 --> 29:58.528
What...?

29:58.529 --> 30:02.308
This is a place of opposites,
where night looks like day.

30:02.309 --> 30:04.443
To travel to the place you wish,

30:04.444 --> 30:08.112
you must start the other way.

30:13.652 --> 30:18.956
But missteps come with penalties
you can't afford to pay.

30:21.193 --> 30:23.796
- Cassandra.
- Silence, Knight.

30:23.797 --> 30:25.830
Take your position.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.336
The rules of the game are simple,

30:30.337 --> 30:32.471
four chances to advance.

30:32.472 --> 30:36.275
Each question answered honestly
wins you another chance.

30:36.276 --> 30:39.478
Attempt a lie, a con, or cheat...

30:39.479 --> 30:42.014
and you will get the lance.

30:42.015 --> 30:43.548
I'm sorry, the what?

30:44.383 --> 30:46.885
Ah, the lance.

30:46.886 --> 30:50.422
Okay, so I'm guessing
this won't be movie trivia.

30:50.423 --> 30:55.194
Teaching is to tend a garden,
sowing seeds into a tree,

30:55.195 --> 30:57.396
throwing all the cage doors open,

30:57.397 --> 31:00.766
letting people's minds fly free.

31:00.767 --> 31:05.971
Would you say that this describes
you? Would your pupils all agree?

31:05.972 --> 31:09.041
Definitely. They absolutely would.

31:09.042 --> 31:11.644
I mean, most of them.

31:11.645 --> 31:14.513
Many of them. I think there's
maybe one or two that wouldn't.

31:14.514 --> 31:16.548
Maybe one who would say
to him that I constantly

31:16.549 --> 31:18.484
deny him his individuality
and awesomeness

31:18.485 --> 31:20.468
for no other reason that
I find it really annoying

31:20.469 --> 31:22.321
and I wish he was more like me.

31:31.964 --> 31:35.734
It seems you are no stranger
to competing games of sport.

31:35.735 --> 31:38.570
The question is, when passions flair,

31:38.571 --> 31:40.939
does your fuse burn long or short?

31:40.940 --> 31:45.411
Are you fine to share the credit
or are you the jealous sort?

31:45.412 --> 31:48.847
I think that I'm a
pretty even-tempered guy.

31:48.848 --> 31:53.319
I mean, I try to be. Okay, I'm
not. Okay, I'm a sore loser.

31:53.320 --> 31:57.156
I'm a bad sport. I like to win and
I like to be first and if I'm not,

31:57.157 --> 31:59.558
I throw a tantrum like a little baby!

32:03.195 --> 32:04.929
Ah, okay.

32:07.266 --> 32:12.271
Relationships define our
lives from birth until the end.

32:12.272 --> 32:14.840
We're careful not to lend bonds break.

32:14.841 --> 32:16.542
They're difficult to mend.

32:16.543 --> 32:20.912
And so I ask you plainly,
are you a caring friend?

32:22.848 --> 32:28.654
Well, how... you know, friendship,
it's kind of a subjective concept, uh...

32:28.655 --> 32:32.091
Let me finish! Let me finish, let me
finish. I was going to say I'm not.

32:32.092 --> 32:33.762
I'm a terrible friend. I don't
know how to be a caring friend.

32:33.763 --> 32:35.761
Or maybe I do and I'm
just afraid to try...

32:35.762 --> 32:39.130
I'm afraid to get close to people
'cause I'm terrified of being hurt.

32:55.314 --> 32:57.549
Three questions down and one to go.

32:57.550 --> 33:01.353
I see you've hit your stride.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.723
But do not get too confident.
You've not yet reached this side.

33:04.724 --> 33:10.596
Do you think you are a humble
man or a victim of your pride?

33:10.597 --> 33:13.332
Well, I wouldn't say I
was a victim of my pride.

33:13.333 --> 33:15.768
I mean... wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:15.769 --> 33:19.238
No, I'm not a humble man. I used to be.

33:19.239 --> 33:24.777
I used to be a lot of things. I used
to be insecure, scared, and I hated it,

33:24.778 --> 33:27.913
and I think I built up an armor
of confidence to hide the fact

33:27.914 --> 33:30.749
that I'm never more than two steps
away from a full-on panic attack.

33:30.750 --> 33:35.754
And I can see... I can see how
that would alienate the people

33:35.755 --> 33:40.157
who care about me the most,
and I'm very sorry about that.

33:52.704 --> 33:57.276
Congratulations, Knight.
You have the inner vision.

33:57.277 --> 34:02.580
The Eye of Ra is yours.
Collect your prize.

34:21.793 --> 34:26.231
I underestimated you. I
didn't think you'd last.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.867
But you found your strength in candor,

34:28.868 --> 34:31.870
and so to you the Eye is passed.

34:31.871 --> 34:36.641
And may I introduce to
you all the remaining cast?

35:02.234 --> 35:05.037
We who have pledged to guard the Eye

35:05.038 --> 35:07.571
now entrust the Eye to you.

35:09.975 --> 35:13.779
In it resides hope eternal,

35:13.780 --> 35:15.981
but it has a secret, too.

35:15.982 --> 35:18.150
Would you like me to tell him?

35:18.151 --> 35:21.253
No, I believe I should tell him.

35:21.254 --> 35:23.755
I also think we can
dispense with the rhyme

35:23.756 --> 35:27.826
and the literary theatrics.

35:27.827 --> 35:31.595
Don't you agree, Flynn?
May I call you Flynn?

35:34.399 --> 35:36.068
Teddy Chislington, I presume.

35:36.069 --> 35:38.470
You're quite a Librarian, Flynn.

35:38.471 --> 35:40.205
Up there with Enoch the Elder.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.541
Well, that is very high
praise, coming from you.

35:42.542 --> 35:46.478
And may I also say that you've done
a masterful job keeping the Eye safe.

35:46.479 --> 35:48.447
What choice did I have?

35:48.448 --> 35:51.683
To possess a weapon designed to be
wielded last in the ultimate battle

35:51.684 --> 35:55.520
is an awesome sense of
responsibility, to say the least.

35:55.521 --> 35:59.124
I knew even the Library was
not secure enough to protect it.

35:59.125 --> 36:02.928
No, I needed to hide it
where others feared to tread,

36:02.929 --> 36:07.766
design a test only a Librarian
with a pure heart could pass.

36:07.767 --> 36:10.902
Why Lewis Carroll?

36:10.903 --> 36:14.372
His characters always
seemed the most fun,

36:14.373 --> 36:18.110
but it's who they represent
to you that's important.

36:18.111 --> 36:22.714
They serve as a mirror, the
test being one of reflection.

36:22.715 --> 36:24.850
Of course. It forces
the challenger to face

36:24.851 --> 36:26.318
whatever it is he fears the most.

36:26.319 --> 36:28.720
Well, every person who
has come through this test

36:28.721 --> 36:31.556
has brought their own
challenges with them.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.658
You're the first to conquer yours.

36:33.659 --> 36:37.996
And now that you have, my work is done.

36:37.997 --> 36:41.399
So, you gave up everything to stay here?

36:41.400 --> 36:44.402
I am at peace.

36:44.403 --> 36:49.107
I assume you know the
history of the Eye of Ra?

36:49.108 --> 36:52.410
Yes, yes, yes. It has to do
with the Egyptian sun god, Ra,

36:52.411 --> 36:56.214
who symbolizes bringing of
the dawn, peace, rebirth.

36:56.215 --> 37:00.886
Partly, but there is a component of
violence inherent in any creation.

37:00.887 --> 37:02.754
A death in every birth.

37:02.755 --> 37:05.090
And for the eye to pursue its gift,

37:05.091 --> 37:08.693
a sacrifice must be made.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.529
What kind of sacrifice?

37:10.530 --> 37:13.665
A life of your choosing.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.034
To knowingly take a life, any life,

37:16.035 --> 37:18.336
is anathema to being a Librarian,

37:18.337 --> 37:22.974
and by far the hardest duty
we're ever asked to perform.

37:22.975 --> 37:26.511
I... I can't do that. I can't do it.

37:26.512 --> 37:30.649
I'm afraid, when push comes to shove,

37:30.650 --> 37:32.217
I wouldn't be able to do that.

37:32.218 --> 37:33.952
I...

37:33.953 --> 37:36.555
can't think of any life that
I'd be willing to lay down

37:36.556 --> 37:39.356
in the service of fighting
evil, other than...

37:45.130 --> 37:46.731
Yes, Flynn.

37:46.732 --> 37:51.303
I know what I have to do.

37:51.304 --> 37:53.971
Maybe I've always known.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.742
Good-bye, Teddy.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.977
Safe travels.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.548
Farewell, Flynn.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.549
You, too.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.811
It's got to be something. Okay, shh.

38:32.812 --> 38:36.147
I can't...

38:36.148 --> 38:37.415
Flynn!

38:37.416 --> 38:38.450
How did you get here?

38:38.451 --> 38:39.951
How did you get off the plane?

38:39.952 --> 38:41.486
Did you find the Eye of Ra?

38:41.487 --> 38:43.588
First things first.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.290
_

38:45.291 --> 38:49.594
Soo-eee!

38:52.999 --> 38:55.079
_

38:55.398 --> 38:56.530
_

38:56.906 --> 38:59.574
_

39:00.605 --> 39:02.607
Bad news concerns your luggage.

39:04.277 --> 39:06.860
Let's fire up the back door, send
these good people on their way.

39:06.861 --> 39:09.361
Gladly. Sir, good to have you back.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.616
I see you were successful.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.118
Indeed, I was.

39:13.119 --> 39:15.587
Then I feel I must tell
you that while the Eye

39:15.588 --> 39:16.955
is our court of last resort,

39:16.956 --> 39:18.590
it does not come without a price.

39:18.591 --> 39:20.926
So I've been made aware.

39:20.927 --> 39:24.562
And when the time
comes, I will be ready.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.698
No, sir, you're not suggesting...

39:26.699 --> 39:29.234
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

39:29.235 --> 39:33.338
And, in the meantime, let's
keep that price tag between us.

39:33.339 --> 39:35.774
Yes, sir. I understand.

39:35.775 --> 39:38.376
I thought you said you
were right behind me.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.345
I know, and I'm sorry.

39:40.346 --> 39:42.747
Didn't want to risk
losing the Eye of Ra.

39:42.748 --> 39:45.116
I didn't want to risk losing you.

39:45.117 --> 39:47.319
Librarians are a dime
a dozen these days,

39:47.320 --> 39:48.787
but a Guardian,

39:48.788 --> 39:50.522
they're a little harder to come by.

39:50.523 --> 39:52.257
What happened to you down there?

39:52.258 --> 39:55.794
Things are gonna be different
from now on, Eve, I promise.

39:55.795 --> 39:58.262
No more running away.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.467
What do we do with him?

40:02.468 --> 40:04.803
I don't know.

40:04.804 --> 40:07.238
Cassandra, what do you
think we should do with him?

40:07.239 --> 40:12.010
Me? Oh, I hadn't thought of anything.

40:12.011 --> 40:15.413
Why don't you and Ezekiel
come up with something?

40:15.414 --> 40:16.982
Be creative. I trust you.

40:16.983 --> 40:19.818
- What are you gonna do?
- Me, I could use a drink.

40:19.819 --> 40:23.082
How about it, Stone? You got a couple of
cold ones stashed around here somewheres?

40:23.083 --> 40:25.457
I might have a couple chillin'
in the Fountain of Youth.

40:25.458 --> 40:28.827
All righty, then. Now that our
Venezuelans are on their way,

40:28.828 --> 40:30.795
I say after we take
care of our DOSA friend,

40:30.796 --> 40:33.619
we all reconvene at the Fountain of
Youth for a little mission debrief.

40:33.620 --> 40:35.266
You sure you're okay?

40:35.267 --> 40:39.404
Let's just say I traveled
through the looking glass

40:39.405 --> 40:42.007
and it was quite a ride.

40:42.008 --> 40:45.910
And I learned that the
best defense to have

40:45.911 --> 40:48.713
is not a suit of pride,

40:48.714 --> 40:52.584
but rather to go into war

40:52.585 --> 40:54.619
with good friends by your side.

40:54.620 --> 40:58.990
So, what do you say, friends?

40:58.991 --> 41:01.125
Shall we see it through?

41:22.013 --> 41:24.349
All right, Librarians,

41:24.350 --> 41:26.583
that's the way you wanna play it, huh?
