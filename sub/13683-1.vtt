Mr. Kingston. Dozens.

06:38.524 --> 06:43.779
The latest one is the nephew
of a Mexican general, Ernesto Calderon.

06:43.862 --> 06:47.366
He went missing
along with his sister some time ago.

07:25.028 --> 07:29.533
I saw him once in Kansas
just before the war.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.746
The ranchers near Wichita
were offering 50Â¢

07:33.829 --> 07:35.873
for every red scalp that was turned in,

07:35.956 --> 07:39.042
and Brant showed up with 1,000 of them.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.337
Red, Mexican, negro, it didn't matter,

07:41.420 --> 07:45.349
as long as they had
dark hair and dark skin.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.760
And later, I saw him
preaching to half the town

07:47.843 --> 07:52.389
with a spirit that I have
neither seen before nor since.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.808
And as God as my witness,

07:54.892 --> 07:58.396
I saw him lay his huge hand

07:58.478 --> 08:01.231
on this gimpy teenage girl.

08:01.315 --> 08:07.196
And he cured her with a touch,
like Christ himself.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.619
Pardon me, Your Honor, but...

08:13.702 --> 08:17.414
but you'll have me believe he simply
touched the girl and she walked?

08:18.040 --> 08:22.002
All the way to the church.
Married her the next day.

If he raised you, you would
not be the man you've become.

01:39:15.706 --> 01:39:21.629
Our entire lives
spent denying death its dominion.

01:39:21.712 --> 01:39:24.089
Seems its answer for us will be...

01:39:24.173 --> 01:39:26.759
painful and slow.

01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:30.429
We deserve it for all we've done.

01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:36.060
Futile to toil over such things.

01:39:39.479 --> 01:39:43.942

Don't go exempting yourself.

01:39:49.031 --> 01:39:52.117
You'll answer the same as everyone else.

David, I was never born
nor will I ever truly die.

Aw, you'll die, all right.

01:40:02.419 --> 01:40:04.755
You'll die right here.

01:40:06.215 --> 01:40:08.634
Your leg will swell.

01:40:08.717 --> 01:40:12.221
You'll scream and try to
kill yourself to save the pain.

01:40:12.429 --> 01:40:14.681
The stench will lead them
to our bodies in a week

01:40:14.765 --> 01:40:16.809
and this scene will show
what I have made of you.

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.563
Word will spread of your death.

01:40:21.647 --> 01:40:26.152
They'll hiss your name, call you
a murderous son of a bitch and a fraud.

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:37.621
The only thing
they'll remember of you will be me.

[GUNSHOT]

01:43:50.814 --> 01:43:53.400
You did send your Rangers out to the town

01:43:53.483 --> 01:43:57.321
to corroborate the stories that my niece
gave you along with the prisoners?

01:43:57.404 --> 01:44:00.032
The... the town was abandoned.

01:44:00.115 --> 01:44:01.992
And the prison?

01:44:02.075 --> 01:44:04.828
It doesn't appear to exist.

01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:13.587
Did your niece say anything else
regarding David Kingston or his wife?

01:44:15.672 --> 01:44:18.475
CALDERON: She said he was badly wounded
when he freed the prisoners

01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:23.096
and he rode out into the brush alone,

01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:25.724
never to be seen again.

01:44:25.807 --> 01:44:27.976
But she made no mention of a woman.

01:44:29.811 --> 01:44:33.565
Perhaps you will allow me a small detail
to go out and search for him.

01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:38.654
I don't think so, General.
He rode off into the brush for a reason.

01:44:40.531 --> 01:44:44.118
If he wants to, he'll ride back out again.
