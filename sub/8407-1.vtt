01:47.720 --> 01:51.290
They just moved out of the O.K. Corral
down by Fly’s.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.630
Looks like Ike and Billy Clanton...

01:53.790 --> 01:58.740
... the McLaurys, Billy Claiborne.
Maybe more.

02:07.340 --> 02:08.820
Let's go.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.610
Morgan, take care of Mama for me.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.670
Keep your little brother out of trouble.

03:15.910 --> 03:19.720
Warren, I won't be seeing you for a while.

05:13.990 --> 05:15.270
Where you headed, Wyatt?

05:17.430 --> 05:18.930
Nowheres.

05:19.700 --> 05:23.240
-I thought you went to Logan.
-I changed my mind.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.610
Where you going, son?

05:28.670 --> 05:32.380
To town. I’m going to enlist, Pa.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.960
I wanna fight the Rebs
with James and Virg.

05:35.510 --> 05:38.220
-I’m ready.
-Are you?

05:41.090 --> 05:43.360
You think your ma's ready?

05:43.960 --> 05:46.060
I don't think she is.

05:47.490 --> 05:53.240
Why'd you wait till I left to take off, Wyatt,
if you think it's the right thing?

06:00.440 --> 06:04.320
Virgil and James should be coming on home
any day soon now.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.950
they do, you know your job.

06:09.550 --> 06:15.260
-What was that? I didn't hear you.
-Eighty acres of corn.

06:15.820 --> 06:17.990
You take on a job, you finish it.

06:18.160 --> 06:23.330
Any man who can't be depended on steady
isn't worth the trouble of having around.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.370
What makes you think
they're coming home soon, Pa?

06:26.530 --> 06:29.030
This war can't last forever.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.770
Besides, it's what I want to happen.

06:34.610 --> 06:37.180
You know I gotta whup you a bit.

07:45.610 --> 07:47.550
Come on, Johnny Reb.

08:09.570 --> 08:11.100
Virgil?

08:14.740 --> 08:16.510
Virgil!

08:26.580 --> 08:29.030
Look who got long and tall.

08:33.460 --> 08:36.490
We didn't know you was coming.
Why didn't you send word?

08:36.659 --> 08:39.870
We didn't know ourselves,
so then we thought we'd just come on.

08:40.030 --> 08:42.010
Well, is James coming too?

08:44.070 --> 08:46.510
James is right here with me, Wyatt.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.650
Hey, Wyatt.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.920
Don't shoot me now, you hear?

09:05.690 --> 09:07.220
James.

09:09.060 --> 09:13.130
-James, welcome home.
-Give us a hand here.

09:31.550 --> 09:34.090
Oh, thank you, Lord.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.950
Your mother thinks there's something
wrong with me.

09:56.110 --> 09:59.420
She says there's something in my blood
that won't allow me to stay put.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.490
Well, she may be right.

10:01.650 --> 10:04.790
If she's lucky,
I haven't passed it on to you.

10:04.950 --> 10:06.590
We'll see.

10:06.820 --> 10:10.490
But for this family, the time has come
to move on again.

10:10.650 --> 10:14.360
To the west of here is a vast expanse
of untamed territory...

10:14.530 --> 10:17.530
...full of wild Indians and countless dangers.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.340
But beyond that wilderness
lies a land with great promise...

10:21.500 --> 10:25.170
...where civilization has flourished
for hundreds of years.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.110
We'll go to California.

10:27.270 --> 10:30.480
-And see what we can make of that place.
-But why, Pa?

10:30.710 --> 10:32.710
There are opportunities for lawyers...

10:32.880 --> 10:35.980
... and rich land available for people
who know how to work.

10:36.150 --> 10:40.250
In California, Wyatt will study the law
and perhaps come to work with me.

10:40.420 --> 10:43.360
Maybe Morgan and Warren
will join our firm.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.030
I’ve already told Pa that I’m not going.
I wanna see what's available to me here.

10:48.530 --> 10:53.470
-I don't wanna go, either.
-Martha's in love with Jimmy Jorgenson.

10:54.470 --> 10:57.100
Good for you, Martha. He's a standup boy.

10:57.270 --> 11:00.940
His family knows what it means
to put down roots.

11:01.370 --> 11:05.080
Martha, if you don't wanna go,
that's your decision.

11:05.780 --> 11:08.880
Well, James has said he will join us,
which suits me fine.

11:09.050 --> 11:11.860
The closer you keep your family,
the better.

11:12.020 --> 11:16.620
They're the only ones you can rely on.
Remember this, all of you.

11:18.390 --> 11:21.430
Nothing counts so much as blood.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.970
The rest are just strangers.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.210
Nicholas, I think
you've already told them that.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
A hundred times.

11:37.810 --> 11:41.880
-Well, you can't hear it enough.
-I heard it a thousand times.

11:42.050 --> 11:45.190
I heard you, Pa. Blood counts the most.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.630
I want you to get these things
and get back.

13:01.790 --> 13:04.430
Don't talk to anyone
you don't have business with.

13:04.600 --> 13:10.010
-Don't worry. I’ll keep an eye on him.
-That doesn't comfort me, Tom Chapman.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.850
Both of you use your heads.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.810
-Don't linger.
-Don't worry, Ma. We won't shame you.

13:24.380 --> 13:25.830
Giddap.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.690
See you guys later. Nice pitchfork.

14:00.150 --> 14:02.430
I like this town, Wyatt.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.570
Why don't you give up?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.430
Excuse me.

14:07.620 --> 14:10.930
I’m not going in there.
I’ll take a look though.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.110
Go ahead!

14:15.000 --> 14:18.140
Walk away. It ain't worth the trouble.

14:19.040 --> 14:23.080
Stand back,
or I’ll settle this right now.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.210
How you doing, Wyatt?

15:30.170 --> 15:32.120
I’m okay, Pa.

15:37.010 --> 15:41.220
You know this land is full of people
doing wicked things to each other.

15:42.020 --> 15:45.590
I ain't afraid. I like it out here.

15:46.290 --> 15:49.000
I like how nothing much has been touched.

15:57.370 --> 15:59.240
I gotta tell you something, Wyatt.

16:00.600 --> 16:05.520
I told your brothers when they went off
to fight. I suppose the time's come for you.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.590
You know I’m a man
that believes in the law.

16:08.750 --> 16:12.250
After your family, it's about the only thing
you got to believe in.

16:13.980 --> 16:17.690
But there are plenty of men
who don't care about the law.

16:18.560 --> 16:24.130
Men who'll take part in all kinds of
viciousness and don't care who gets hurt.

16:24.290 --> 16:27.140
In fact, the more that get hurt, the better.

16:28.400 --> 16:33.850
When you find yourself in a fight
with such viciousness...

16:34.000 --> 16:36.480
... hit first if you can.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.880
And when you do hit...

16:39.040 --> 16:41.220
... hit to kill.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.960
You'll know. Don't worry.

16:47.990 --> 16:50.490
You'll know when it comes to that.

16:55.860 --> 16:58.130
The Earps always know.

17:15.550 --> 17:18.319
Damn it, Wyatt, move this wagon!
They're catching up!

17:18.480 --> 17:21.430
-This is all we got, Dutch!
-Well, whip those nags!

17:41.440 --> 17:43.980
Giddap! Giddap!

17:49.510 --> 17:52.050
Hold on, Dutch!

18:03.190 --> 18:04.500
They're on us!

18:05.460 --> 18:07.600
-Shoot the horse.
-What?

18:07.760 --> 18:09.610
Shoot the lead horse!

18:09.800 --> 18:12.210
You can hit a horse, can't you?

18:35.390 --> 18:37.200
Come on, boys.

18:45.770 --> 18:48.340
That horse never done nothing to me.

18:52.640 --> 18:56.890
You should be riding shotgun.
I’ve seen you shoot.

18:58.050 --> 19:00.360
Of course, I can't handle a team like you.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.430
Hell, we made it. That's the thing.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.670
You ever shoot a man, Dutch?

19:16.830 --> 19:21.680
Sure, I shot a few.
How do you think I got this job?

19:22.440 --> 19:24.480
How about yourself?

19:27.610 --> 19:29.180
No.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.860
Hope I never do either.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.450
Good luck.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.340
Here, girl.

20:41.650 --> 20:44.260
It’s the sore-ass boys
back for a Fourth of July.

20:44.420 --> 20:47.090
-Hey, Red.
-I hope you brought sugar in this load.

20:47.260 --> 20:49.830
I ain't had no real sugar for a month.

20:50.030 --> 20:54.410
What's happening in this hellhole, Red?
You got any new ladies up to my standards?

20:54.560 --> 20:57.240
I believe there is a new one
just right for you.

20:57.400 --> 21:01.850
She can stay awake two minutes at a time,
and she favors them teeny little wangers.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.350
Look who's talking.

21:05.710 --> 21:08.880
Prize fight Sunday morning, Wyatt.
You gonna referee?

21:09.050 --> 21:12.720
I don't know. Last time some of the boys
didn't like the decision.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.460
Sore losers. Hell with them. See you later.

21:38.140 --> 21:39.590
Fight.

21:40.180 --> 21:43.710
-Get him, Shanssey!
-Keep your guard up, Shanssey.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.260
That's it. Take him down!

21:46.750 --> 21:49.360
Hands! Keep your hands off!

21:51.960 --> 21:56.490
One. Two. Three.

21:56.990 --> 22:01.270
-You're hurt, Mr. Shanssey.
-No, I’m just getting started.

22:01.630 --> 22:04.270
-It’s not worth it.
-Let me fight him.

22:04.430 --> 22:06.000
-Are you sure?
-Aye.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.940
Fight.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.230
Enough. Enough.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.500
It’s over.

22:34.760 --> 22:38.470
God bless you, boy.
God bless you.

22:46.710 --> 22:49.550
Hey. Hey, kid.

22:49.980 --> 22:53.260
You don't know a boxing ring
from a mule's asshole.

22:53.420 --> 22:56.020
And you twice cost me money.

22:56.590 --> 22:59.090
Sorry you didn't like the decision.

23:02.830 --> 23:06.070
-Hey.
-Stay out. It’s not your fight.

23:25.420 --> 23:27.720
Come on, Wyatt.

23:30.150 --> 23:34.620
-This is the damnedest game I ever saw.
-You can't get a spot now anyway.

23:34.790 --> 23:37.290
So why don't you come on up with me
for a while?

23:37.830 --> 23:40.240
I don't know if that's
the right thing to do, Sally.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.770
See, I promised my heart to another.

23:42.930 --> 23:45.440
Which girl? I’ll fight her for you.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.240
It’s no one here.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.210
She's back in Lamar, Missouri,
where my grandparents live.

23:50.510 --> 23:54.150
Missouri? Wyatt, she ain't gonna
help you tonight.

23:55.350 --> 23:59.020
I saw her three times back in '63.

23:59.220 --> 24:02.360
The third time she smiled at me just right.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.590
Wyatt.

24:04.750 --> 24:08.330
I guarantee you, she don't know
what I know.

24:10.730 --> 24:14.830
I’ll bet you're right about that,
unless things have changed in Lamar.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.200
Hey, Wyatt.

24:18.370 --> 24:22.750
Your boy, Dutch, is drunk and he's telling
everybody how you're gonna take Ed Ross.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.910
Damn.

24:26.540 --> 24:28.550
Who's Ed Ross?

24:28.710 --> 24:31.720
He's the guy who decked you
at the fight this morning.

24:31.880 --> 24:36.450
Look, I’d get a hold of Dutch before
he starts some real trouble for you, all right?

24:37.490 --> 24:39.690
-Thanks, Red.
-Sure.

24:41.290 --> 24:45.740
I know Ed Ross. He's bad business.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.380
I’d better find Dutch.

24:49.570 --> 24:53.540
-Gentlemen, that's it for me.
-You don't have to leave yet.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.240
-You done?
-All yours.

25:02.950 --> 25:05.220
-How do you play this game?
-Simple, friend.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.330
Place your bet on a number to win.

25:07.480 --> 25:11.230
If you're betting for it to lose,
tap her with a penny on top.

25:11.720 --> 25:16.030
All bets on the spread, comes the turn.
The loser, jack.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.770
The winner is ace.

25:19.460 --> 25:23.770
-I had a feeling this was a game for me.
-You're a winner, sir.

25:24.030 --> 25:26.910
Now can we have a better time
than this upstairs?

25:27.070 --> 25:29.880
At least upstairs
I’d be making some money.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.980
Wyatt Earp!

25:47.360 --> 25:48.770
That's my name.

25:49.230 --> 25:52.760
Well, that don't mean shit to me
or anybody else in this world.

25:52.930 --> 25:54.810
And it never will after this night.

25:55.130 --> 25:59.010
-Ed, this boy ain't worth your trouble.
-Shut up, Sally.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.280
Earp.

26:01.770 --> 26:04.580
I hear you was looking for me
to make a fight.

26:04.940 --> 26:07.320
So I thought I’d be easy to find.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.790
You heard wrong, mister.

26:09.950 --> 26:13.520
Only thing that's happened between us
is I got popped good.

26:13.680 --> 26:16.100
-I don't wanna make a fight.
-Stop talking.

26:25.030 --> 26:26.700
Okay.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.120
This man wanted to shoot me down...

27:10.940 --> 27:12.940
... over nothing!

27:15.950 --> 27:17.820
He lost.

27:20.950 --> 27:23.190
I’m taking his gun.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.880
Boom.

29:35.820 --> 29:38.320
-Yes?
-Hello, Mrs. Sutherland.

29:38.490 --> 29:42.900
-I don't expect you'll remember me--
-I know perfectly well who you are.

29:43.060 --> 29:45.800
Your grandmother said
you were coming back to Lamar.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.200
Yes, ma’am. I’m reading the law
with Judge Earp.

29:51.070 --> 29:53.340
Are those flowers for me?

29:54.940 --> 29:57.350
Well, if you'd like them,
then, yes, they are.

29:57.710 --> 30:02.520
No, thanks. Let me see
if Urilla is around.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.020
She might take them.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.500
Hello, Wyatt.

30:24.870 --> 30:26.780
Hello, Urilla.

30:29.910 --> 30:31.250
I brought you these.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.450
Thank you.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.090
I was glad to hear
you were coming back to town.

30:40.080 --> 30:43.690
-You were?
-Yes, I was.

30:46.460 --> 30:48.400
What's wrong?

30:49.130 --> 30:50.700
Wrong?

30:51.090 --> 30:53.160
Nothing. It’s....

30:54.600 --> 30:56.130
What is it, Wyatt?

30:58.470 --> 31:01.070
Well, I wasn't prepared
for how beautiful you are.

31:03.110 --> 31:05.680
Did you learn to talk that way out west?

31:20.960 --> 31:23.840
So you've come to Lamar
to study with your grandfather?

31:23.990 --> 31:25.600
Yes.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.870
And to marry you.

31:35.070 --> 31:37.740
-Do you think it's as simple as that?
-No.

31:37.910 --> 31:40.910
I know it will take a great effort
to win you.

31:42.710 --> 31:45.220
I know many men have tried.

31:45.550 --> 31:48.530
They failed because
you were meant for me.

31:49.290 --> 31:53.460
But I’ll succeed.
I’ll begin today.

32:01.430 --> 32:03.640
Is that your hat?

32:44.470 --> 32:46.780
When do you expect
to begin your practice, Wyatt?

32:47.580 --> 32:49.990
It may be a while yet, sir.

32:50.150 --> 32:54.290
The judge says he's never seen anybody
make slower progress.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.630
That's because the law
is so damn boring.

33:00.790 --> 33:03.860
Erwin, not everyone has the aptitude
to be a blacksmith.

33:04.030 --> 33:05.560
Oh, I don't know.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.500
I think I could teach Wyatt here
a thing or two...

33:08.660 --> 33:13.170
-... if he was willing to work at it.
-I appreciate that, but I found a job.

33:13.770 --> 33:17.080
I thought I ought to make a living
while I continue my studies.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.550
What is it, Wyatt? What's the job?

33:19.940 --> 33:21.850
With the city police.

33:22.010 --> 33:23.890
I’m to be a constable.

33:24.710 --> 33:28.750
I figure a man who's about to propose
marriage better have a livelihood.

33:36.790 --> 33:39.200
When do you expect this proposal
to happen, Wyatt...

33:39.360 --> 33:41.270
... so we can all join in the crying?

33:41.900 --> 33:45.740
Daddy, Wyatt's proposed to me every day
since he's been back in town.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.580
--be faithful to him as long
as you both shall live?

36:14.850 --> 36:16.090
I do.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.430
May we have the ring, please?

36:22.690 --> 36:26.400
Place the ring on the ring finger
of her left hand...

36:26.700 --> 36:28.470
... and repeat after me.

36:29.060 --> 36:30.980
-Urilla.
-Urilla.

36:31.130 --> 36:33.340
With this ring, I thee wed.

36:33.670 --> 36:35.550
With this ring, I thee wed.

36:35.840 --> 36:40.750
By the virtue of the authority vested in me
as a judge of the State of Missouri Court...

36:41.310 --> 36:44.050
... I now pronounce you husband and wife.

36:54.520 --> 36:57.700
Urilla, if it doesn't work out,
you know where to find me.

36:57.860 --> 37:00.860
Wyatt, you give it your best shot.
You can do it.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.840
Make us proud, Wyatt.

37:26.860 --> 37:29.600
You've never seen such open space, Urilla.

37:31.060 --> 37:33.400
You can ride all day towards some
mountain...

37:33.560 --> 37:35.630
... and never even get close.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.040
There's practically nobody there.

37:39.770 --> 37:41.770
The few people that are...

37:42.510 --> 37:45.350
...they just make up whatever
kind of life they want.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.820
What if you don't ever go back?

37:49.710 --> 37:51.590
That's all right. I seen it.

37:53.250 --> 37:56.490
I don't wanna be the reason
that you're not happy, Wyatt.

37:57.820 --> 38:00.320
I could be happy anywhere with you,
Urilla.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.900
I don't care what job I have
or where I live.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.710
What I care about is being with you.

39:32.980 --> 39:35.660
I thought this was only supposed
to happen in the morning.

39:35.820 --> 39:38.460
Please, Wyatt, let's not talk about it.

39:41.760 --> 39:43.330
Urilla....

39:43.490 --> 39:45.630
Can't you let me be?

40:34.880 --> 40:36.150
You can't go in.

40:36.310 --> 40:38.760
-I wanna see my girl.
-I can't allow it.

40:38.910 --> 40:41.190
Has something gone wrong
with the pregnancy?

40:41.350 --> 40:43.730
This has nothing to do with that.

40:44.090 --> 40:45.360
It’s typhoid.

40:45.620 --> 40:48.120
I’m going to have to quarantine the house.

40:48.820 --> 40:52.700
I can't let you go in, Esther.
It wouldn't be fair to the town.

41:31.100 --> 41:33.100
Wyatt....

42:25.190 --> 42:29.260
--our blessed Savior, who is himself
the resurrection and the life...

42:29.420 --> 42:33.600
... has assured us that this body,
which we now commit to the ground...

42:33.760 --> 42:38.440
... dust to dust and ashes to ashes,
shall be raised in a perfect form...

42:38.700 --> 42:41.770
... and united to the spirit
which has gone to God.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.480
The grace of Jesus Christ...

42:47.640 --> 42:50.990
... and the love of God,
and the communion of the Holy Ghost....

44:24.770 --> 44:26.750
Come on.
What's the matter with you?

44:26.910 --> 44:28.890
What's the matter with you?

44:29.510 --> 44:31.320
What the hell?

44:31.480 --> 44:32.860
Come on. Back off.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.960
This ain't no hotel, you stinking bum.

44:42.860 --> 44:45.170
I can't tell you from the horse crap.

44:57.940 --> 44:59.710
Keep walking.

45:18.830 --> 45:20.360
Pardon me, sir.

45:21.560 --> 45:24.630
I wonder if you could spare a fellow
the price of a meal.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.240
You're drunk.

45:28.340 --> 45:31.880
-No, sir, not at present.
-You reek of it and worse.

45:32.110 --> 45:34.640
I’m not in the business of helping drunks.

45:36.110 --> 45:37.990
You're correct, mister.

45:38.150 --> 45:42.290
I have done my share of drinking lately,
and I intend to correct my behavior.

45:42.450 --> 45:44.360
And it would be a good....

45:45.450 --> 45:49.030
It would be a good start if you could
lend me the price of a meal.

45:49.190 --> 45:51.640
There's no excuse for drunkenness.

45:52.030 --> 45:55.200
Or for the self-pity
which so often occasions it.

45:58.770 --> 46:00.080
Yes, sir.

46:01.370 --> 46:04.580
If you really want a meal, come with me,
and I’ll arrange it.

46:04.740 --> 46:06.690
But I won't give you money.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.080
Thank you, sir. I accept.

46:16.690 --> 46:21.000
I don't know if they'll serve you here.
Maybe they'll give you a meal in the back.

46:22.290 --> 46:23.560
Wait!

46:47.380 --> 46:50.230
You don't know what you're talking about!

47:26.720 --> 47:28.630
-You want a snort?
-No.

47:31.690 --> 47:34.260
-Bob?
-Coming.

47:44.240 --> 47:47.380
-Here. You can have the hat, too!
-Son of a bitch!

48:08.660 --> 48:10.200
That's a little better.

48:10.370 --> 48:13.780
Leastwise, I can take you in my bed
without you fouling it.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.670
I’m sure you have your standards.

48:16.840 --> 48:18.150
Don't think I don't.

48:21.140 --> 48:24.020
-Pretty new at this, ain't you?
-What?

48:25.850 --> 48:27.950
Making a wreck of yourself.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.330
Won't last much longer.

48:36.160 --> 48:38.260
Gonna reform, are you, ace?

48:40.560 --> 48:43.510
Reckon I’ll get myself
shot dead pretty soon.

48:55.940 --> 48:58.620
Let's find out what's left of you.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.120
All right.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.900
Wyatt....

50:38.880 --> 50:40.480
Pa?

50:51.890 --> 50:53.500
Horse thief.

51:02.670 --> 51:06.880
-How did you find--?
-Shut up! Do you wanna die?

51:08.140 --> 51:11.920
That's what they do to horse thieves.
They hang them.

51:12.480 --> 51:14.120
I don't care....

51:16.420 --> 51:19.660
Do you think you're the first man
to lose someone?

51:20.760 --> 51:23.860
That's what life is all about, loss.

51:25.790 --> 51:29.430
But we don't use it as an excuse
to destroy ourselves.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.610
We go on. All of us.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.250
Even you, Wyatt.

51:43.650 --> 51:46.020
You're getting out of here.

51:55.820 --> 51:58.000
I gave them $500 bail.

51:58.830 --> 52:01.600
And I told them I’d defend you at your trial.

52:05.270 --> 52:07.750
There's not gonna be any trial.

52:10.710 --> 52:13.550
Because if they try you, they'll hang you.

52:13.710 --> 52:16.450
And if they catch you, they'll hang you.

52:19.550 --> 52:23.430
So you get on that horse, Wyatt,
and you ride.

52:24.050 --> 52:27.800
You keep riding
till you get out of Arkansas.

52:29.490 --> 52:31.970
And you don't come back here, ever.

54:32.450 --> 54:34.690
Get them two, right there.

54:47.630 --> 54:49.200
Ed.

54:58.270 --> 55:00.380
This could be the one.

55:02.680 --> 55:05.160
I got it. I got it.

55:07.280 --> 55:11.420
-How about some hot coffee?
-We serve warm whiskey, not hot coffee.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.970
Why don't you find me some coffee?

55:18.930 --> 55:20.740
Coffee she is.

55:20.900 --> 55:22.140
Excuse me, mister.

55:22.500 --> 55:26.500
We saw you come in with your wagon,
but we didn't see any skinners with you.

55:26.670 --> 55:28.410
That's because there wasn't any.

55:28.840 --> 55:30.180
Quit?

55:30.340 --> 55:31.780
Dead.

55:32.670 --> 55:35.450
That's as good as quit in my book.

55:38.550 --> 55:41.250
My brother and me are looking
for work as skinners.

55:41.850 --> 55:43.330
Bartender!

55:43.480 --> 55:46.520
My luck finally turned
with those big stinking bastards.

55:46.690 --> 55:48.290
Whiskey all around!

55:54.560 --> 55:57.300
-No, thanks.
-Wait a second, mister.

55:57.770 --> 56:00.910
Link Borland's buying, so drink up.

56:01.800 --> 56:03.780
Thanks, but I got some coffee coming.

56:04.470 --> 56:06.080
I don't do well on whiskey.

56:06.340 --> 56:09.380
If you'd pay for my coffee,
I’d be much obliged.

56:10.880 --> 56:12.190
Drink!

56:14.050 --> 56:16.860
Mister, I’ve been in a real bad mood
for a couple of years...

56:17.020 --> 56:19.330
... so why don't you leave me alone?

56:24.230 --> 56:26.230
Drop your gun belt...

56:26.390 --> 56:28.460
... and go away.

56:48.320 --> 56:50.350
Got any experience?

56:50.650 --> 56:52.260
A little.

56:54.890 --> 56:57.870
It ain't too hard shooting a bunch
of dumb animals.

56:58.330 --> 57:00.360
Skinning's the ugly part.

57:00.530 --> 57:02.800
Our mother didn't raise no shirkers.

57:07.940 --> 57:12.010
-Twenty-five dollars apiece.
-Mister, that's a deal.

57:12.170 --> 57:13.910
My name is Ed Masterson.

57:14.210 --> 57:15.690
-This is my brother--
-Bat.

57:15.840 --> 57:18.350
-What?
-Bat. Bat Masterson.

57:19.310 --> 57:20.850
Bat?

57:22.550 --> 57:24.290
Okay, Bat.

57:24.450 --> 57:25.830
Wyatt Earp.

58:08.960 --> 58:11.440
We got a brother named Jim too.

58:11.700 --> 58:13.410
One brother?

58:14.300 --> 58:18.720
That's all you boys got?
One measly brother?

58:21.980 --> 58:25.690
Well.... Better than nothing, I guess.

58:27.580 --> 58:30.590
There's nothing counts so much as blood.

58:32.390 --> 58:34.700
Everybody else is just strangers.

58:35.120 --> 58:38.830
Well, I guess we know where we stand
with old Wyatt here, don't we, Ed?

58:40.160 --> 58:45.440
You boys keep up that good skinning,
you just might get to be family yet.

58:45.730 --> 58:48.370
Of course, before you can be family...

58:49.270 --> 58:52.270
... I’d have to know where
you got that name, Bat.

58:52.770 --> 58:54.080
It’s just my name.

58:54.240 --> 58:57.780
I already told you 1 0 times, Wyatt.
They always called me that.

58:57.980 --> 58:59.250
Shut up, Ed.

58:59.410 --> 59:03.790
I tell you what, Ed. Tell me his real name,
I’ll let you do some shooting tomorrow.

59:03.950 --> 59:06.490
It’s Bartholomew. Bartholomew Masterson.

59:06.950 --> 59:08.460
Bartholomew?

59:13.330 --> 59:17.500
Why, Bat, that's a beautiful name.

59:18.070 --> 59:21.980
There's no reason to be ashamed
of a $25 handle like that.

59:23.200 --> 59:26.120
Maybe I’ll just call you that all the time.

59:26.840 --> 59:28.250
Bartholomew.

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:31.150
Sure you won't change your mind
and take another run at them?

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:34.450
No, I’m gonna visit my brother James
over in Wichita.

01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:36.090
Meet his wife.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.820
See if I can’t figure out a better way
to make a living--

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.090
Than shooting a bunch of dumb animals.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.920
Don't hold much future, that's for sure.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:49.300
Not with every asshole in the territory
plugging away dawn till dusk.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.600
That's us, ain't it?

01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:58.900
Are all bets in?

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:01.670
Next card, loser is six, winner is eight.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.050
-Just in time, sir.
-Thank you.

01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:17.350
That's good, Wyatt.

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:22.470
Gentlemen, hold your bets
for the new dealer.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.630
James.

01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:33.210
-How's it going?
-I’m getting the hang of it.

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:38.940
I like that game. I wouldn’t mind
owning a place, I’ll tell you that.

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:43.110
Last week you wanted to start a stage line.
Or was that the silver mine?

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.220
Now we're gonna have our own saloon.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.990
All I know is there's not much future
in working for other people.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:53.760
Who knows, Wyatt?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.960
With what Bessie makes,
maybe we could get a bit together.

01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.730
Hi there.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.930
She's my wife, Wyatt.

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:05.910
You know I don't like counting on women.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.480
Hell, I’d count on Bessie
ahead of any man I know.

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:14.080
What you got against her, anyhow?

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:19.050
-Well, she's a whore, James.
-Yes, she is, Wyatt.

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:21.120
And a hard-working one at that.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.360
What are you doing with her?

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.860
Same thing everyone else
is doing with her.

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.190
Only difference is she doesn't charge me.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.600
It doesn't bother you?

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:33.600
That she doesn't charge me?
No, I’m rather fond of the arrangement.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.970
On a good day, I can even get her
to cook and clean a little.

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:42.510
-What was that? I didn’t hear you.
-Nothing.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.310
Your arrangement doesn't bother you,
I guess it doesn't bother me.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:50.010
That's a big load off my mind, Wyatt.

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.180
I’ve been losing sleep worrying about...

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:54.880
...whether or not my arrangement
bothered you.

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:15.740
I got something for you!

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:22.220
-Where are you, big man?
-Look out!

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.750
What in tarnation?

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.820
What the hell's going on here?

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.490
Rowdy Dubbs is in the Iron Spike,
drunk and mad.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:36.760
He's already shot one man.
Ford here's gotta go in and get him.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.770
Oh, no.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.300
It’s your job, isn't it?

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:46.940
Not anymore.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.070
They don't pay me enough
to commit suicide.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.020
Give me it.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.670
I see you out there!

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.940
My leg!

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.180
Oh, shut up.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.730
I don't see anybody else in there,
but maybe you'd better check around.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:47.060
-Young man, how'd you like a job?
-I got a job over at Pryor's dealing faro.

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:48.970
Seventy-five dollars a month.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.300
-I don't know. Being a deputy isn't--
-I’ll make it 1 00...

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:55.280
-... but don't hold me up for more.
-A hundred dollars?

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.520
What's the marshal gonna say?

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:01.880
Marshal Meagher's gonna like you
just fine, deputy.

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:17.350
This could be trouble.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:21.860
Hold on, Mike. Don't shoot him.

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.570
-How are you, Wyatt?
-This is my no-good brother, Morgan.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.170
As opposed to your
no-good brother, James.

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:33.570
-That's right.
-Morgan, meet Marshal Meagher.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.810
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.220
Now, take off those guns.

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:42.150
-Do what?
-Take off your guns.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.720
Take them off.

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:49.560
-When'd you get to town?
-About an hour ago.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.960
-This boy would make one hell of a deputy.
-Might have an opening some time.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.570
If we do, he can put them back on.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:01.100
-It’s really good to see you, Morgan.
-You, too, Wyatt.

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.240
Come on. I wanna
show you something.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.210
-Go ahead.
-Come on!

01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:13.010
You're not gonna believe this, Wyatt.
Hold on to your hat.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.020
Or maybe just take it off.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.680
You decent, hon?

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.790
Here he is.

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:32.270
Lou, this is him.

01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:34.460
This is my big brother.

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:37.900
-How do you do, ma’am?
-It’s a pleasure to meet you, James.

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:42.440
This is Wyatt, not James.
We'll find James later.

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.720
Lou and I met out in California
when I was out to see the folks.

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:49.250
Isn't she the sweetest thing
you ever seen?

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.390
I believe she is.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:29.020
Ma’am.

01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:42.470
Wyatt Earp!

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:44.810
Don't shoot.

01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:48.069
If you miss me,
it'd destroy your reputation.

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:50.939
Mister, I ain't in the mood.

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:54.810
Larry Deger from Dodge City.

01:08:54.979 --> 01:08:58.080
People tell me you the man
I’m looking for.

01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:05.430
We used to see 30, 000 head of cattle
come through in a season.

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:08.359
Hell, this year looks closer to 300, 000.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.000
Think about it.

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:14.000
-How much?
-Seventy-five a month.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.600
-I’m making more than that here.
-Plus $2. 50 for every arrest.

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:25.710
I need help and lots of it.
Things are already out of hand.

01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:29.080
-So you're looking for more than one?
-Hell, yes.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.450
You know anyone you can trust?

01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:35.520
I might know a few.

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:29.770
I’m Wyatt Earp.

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.750
Who?

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.150
Wyatt Earp!

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.810
Who the fuck is Wyatt Earp?

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.190
It appears to be just some asshole.

01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:50.460
He's the asshole who enforces the law.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.330
-There ain't no law in Dodge City.
-That's right.

01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.410
Not for the Clements crew.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.800
Stand down.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.770
We got some new laws
since you boys were here.

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.430
Tell them, Morgan.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.950
All visitors will check their guns
immediately upon arrival.

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:07.520
That'll be the day.

01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:11.620
No discharge of firearms
within the city limits...

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:15.120
... except on the Fourth of July
and Christmas Day.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.520
No riding into the stores...

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.000
... saloons, the dance halls,
or the gambling houses.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.730
And no public intoxication.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.800
Mannen, what's that supposed to mean,
public intoxication?

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.370
I think what it means
is we done enough talking.

01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:33.810
Nope.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.280
It means if you do anything
we don't much approve of...

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.540
...we got a legal right to shoot you down.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.080
You the one that's gonna try it?

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.160
Mr. Clements, your men respect you.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.360
And I don't wanna do anything
to take away from that.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.260
I’m sure you've earned it.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.900
You and your boys are welcome
in Dodge City...

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.170
... as long as you obey the law.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.600
But if you don't wanna cooperate...

01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:10.840
... I’ll open you up right now
with this shotgun so wide...

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.420
... your whole crew's gonna see
what you had for breakfast.

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:25.490
After that it won't matter much
what happens next, will it?

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.540
Give up your guns, boys.

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:45.770
Only ones you need now are sitting
right between your legs.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:13.140
-The job don't pay a salary to start.
-No salary?

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.870
Pays $2. 50 for every arrest.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.740
Wyatt cleared, what, $1000 last month?

01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:23.010
-Hell, how many is that?
-A lot.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:29.180
You've got yourself a bit
of a reputation, Wyatt.

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:33.160
It’s a tricky thing,
the reputation business, Bat.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.060
I gotta tell you,
not all a man hears is good.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.700
We heard about you
all the way over in Abilene.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.700
What're they saying?

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.540
That people in Dodge are complaining
you're too quick to bash a man...

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:47.440
...just because you don't
like the way he looks.

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:52.640
You just tell me what son of a bitch
is complaining, and I’ll go bash him.

01:13:55.980 --> 01:14:00.320
Look, there are plenty of people
around here who like Wyatt.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.590
Let's see, there's me, there's Virgil...

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:05.990
...there's me....

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:16.800
You might as well get broke in sometime.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.500
Why don't you boys handle this one?

01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:22.940
-Evening.
-I understand, let me tell you--

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.410
Evening!

01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:29.010
Looks like you boys
have been doing some drinking.

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.420
-Yeah? What makes you say that?
-Intuition, I guess.

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.620
We're glad you're having
a good time...

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:40.490
... but you know there is a city ordinance
against wearing firearms in town.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.360
-Says who?
-Says the law, that's who.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.630
Bat, you're being about as sociable
as an ulcerated molar.

01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:49.600
These boys, they don't--

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.810
Shit, Wyatt!

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:00.010
You talk too much, Ed.

01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:03.550
You didn't have to do that, Wyatt.

01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:21.040
Holy.... I’ll be a son of a bitch.
How--?

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:36.490
That fella could've gone for his gun
after he saw you buffalo his friend.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.380
Maybe.

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:45.990
He was so drunk he couldn't have hit
the ground with his hat in three tries.

01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:50.530
I’m just saying, I believe I could've talked
those guns off him, Wyatt.

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:53.470
Ed, if I were you, I’d look
for another line of work.

01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:55.160
Politics, maybe.

01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:59.240
Ed's got a different style is all,
Wyatt. People like it.

01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:02.200
You could get killed
in this line of work, Ed.

01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:04.440
You could get people around you killed.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.950
-Wyatt, we're just getting started.
-I know.

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:09.450
When I hit that fella, Bat,
your first instinct...

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:12.020
...was to pull your weapon
and cover me.

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.780
This is a harsh land, Ed.

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:17.450
It doesn't suffer fools.

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:21.020
I’m not a fool, Wyatt.

01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.030
No, you're not.

01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:25.930
But you're not a deliberate man, Ed.

01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:28.440
I don't sense that about you.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.400
You're too affable.

01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:57.130
Don't do that, Wyatt. Please.

01:16:57.290 --> 01:17:01.200
-You know how I feel.
-I want to, Mattie.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.400
I could make you happy, Wyatt.
I know I could.

01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:08.940
You just give me a chance.
I could be a wife to you.

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:15.410
I care for you, but I’m not gonna tell you
things that aren't true.

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:23.560
I don't wanna hurt you, Mattie,
but if seeing me causes you pain--

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.820
No. No.

01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:29.390
We have time.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.400
I have to give you time, that's all.
You'll see.

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.800
Only, don't leave money
on my dresser, please.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.240
Unless....

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.620
Unless it's because you wanna
take care of me.

01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:48.450
Is that how you mean it, Wyatt?

01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:09.030
Bat. Ed.

01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:12.430
Wyatt, the mayor's asked us
to come get you.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.870
The mayor? Is something going on?

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.980
Some people are concerned about the way
you've been handling things, Wyatt.

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.110
What do you think, Ed?

01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:29.120
There's been some complaints.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.100
From some in jail, maybe, not from citizens.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:33.730
Some of them too.

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:37.990
I’m just saying this out of friendship,
Wyatt, so you know.

01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:40.460
All I know is the mayor wants to see you.

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:43.070
He asked us to find you.
That's what we did.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.550
You know, Donovan went all the way
to a title shot after that bout.

01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:31.050
Don't know what shape I’d be in today
if you hadn't have stopped that fight.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:32.960
Drink?

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.090
What are you doing in these parts, Wyatt?

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:42.360
I thought you was the deputy marshal
in Dodge.

01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:45.030
I was...

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:49.340
...till the city fathers forgot
to renew my contract.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.240
Too much of a hard-ass, I guess.

01:19:51.730 --> 01:19:54.800
Well, you are, Wyatt.
Everybody knows that.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.350
-Who replaced you?
-A fella named Masterson.

01:19:58.510 --> 01:20:01.320
-Bat Masterson?
-No.

01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:03.210
It was his brother Ed.

01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:05.320
What's he like?

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.150
He's affable.

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:09.190
Very affable.

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:11.090
What are you up to?

01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:18.190
I’m doing a job for the railroad. Looking
for a fellow named Dave Rudabaugh.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.670
-Know him?
-Yeah.

01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:21.770
I heard he might be headed this way.

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:26.810
Well, he come through here all right,
but where he went I couldn't tell you.

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.810
What'd he do?

01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:32.350
He robbed the Santa Fe train three times,
looks like.

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:36.780
There is somebody
who might know something.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.720
If he does, he'll probably tell you.
He hates Rudabaugh.

01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:44.390
-His name's Doc Holliday.
-He's a killer, isn't he?

01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:46.430
He's killed some.

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:51.930
He owes me a couple of favors,
and he's as good as his word.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.800
He's dying of tuberculosis.

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:58.970
He travels with a whore
named Big Nose Kate...

01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:00.540
... but he's not her pimp.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.240
You take me to him?

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.240
-Doc.
-John.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.240
I’d like you to meet a friend of mine,
Wyatt Earp.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.840
Wyatt Earp.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.210
I’ve heard that name somewhere.
Don't know where, but it wasn't good.

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.950
Mind if we sit down?

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.060
I’m looking for Dave Rudabaugh.

01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:01.330
There's a reward for information
about him.

01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:04.000
Are you a lawman, Wyatt Earp?

01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:08.980
You are not wearing a badge.
Are you ashamed of your profession?

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:11.840
I myself was a dentist.
I was proud to be a dentist.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:15.180
I did not hide the fact that I was a dentist.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:18.190
How are your teeth, Wyatt Earp?

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.750
They're working all right.

01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:23.660
Well, take good care of them.
They cannot be replaced.

01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:30.390
I am no longer a dentist.
I’m a sporting man. That is my work now.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:34.800
In Georgia, we were taught that a man
should take pride in his work.

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:38.740
Have you ever been to Georgia, Wyatt Earp?

01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:42.840
Beautiful state, Georgia.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:46.980
Very green.
I was forced to leave Georgia.

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:50.450
I fear that I will never see it again.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.850
I’m sorry.

01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:22.610
Do you believe in friendship, Wyatt Earp?

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.360
So do I.

01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:30.520
Do you have many friends?

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:38.070
John here has been a friend to me
when most men were not.

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:44.570
Dave Rudabaugh is an ignorant scoundrel.
I disapprove of his very existence.

01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:48.800
I considered ending it myself
on several occasions...

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.570
... but self-control got the better of me.

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:57.250
Besides, I’m a sporting man...

01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:59.390
... not a killer.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.640
So...

01:24:13.530 --> 01:24:16.770
...tell me about the reward, Wyatt Earp.

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:23.010
You'd be doing me a favor if you would
call me either Wyatt or Earp.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.210
Not both.

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.180
All right.

01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:31.620
Wyatt.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.990
Call me Doc.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.410
Hey, bartender.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.190
Howdy, friend.

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:13.860
You ain't my friend.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.000
True enough, but I am the law here...

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:19.830
... and the law says that you can't wear
the gun in town. Hand it over.

01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:22.800
What if I don't?

01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:28.240
I’ll have to take it away from you.
You'll go to jail. You'll miss the party.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.470
You don't want that, now, do you?

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.180
Give it to me!

01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:46.090
Don't give it back till they leave town.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:49.590
Thank you.

01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:05.210
-I sure will do that.
-Okay, good. You have a good night.

01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:40.180
-That one laying over there....
-I didn't see who it was.

01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.790
Bat....

01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:01.170
Bat, I’m shot.

01:27:12.610 --> 01:27:14.180
Ed!

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:17.410
Oh, God.

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:23.180
Oh, God!

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.790
Let's go.

01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.390
My name is Wyatt Earp.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.240
It all ends now!

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.680
-Hello, Doc.
-Wyatt...

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.050
... I’d like you to meet a friend of mine,
Kate Elder.

01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:36.920
-Nice to meet you, Miss Elder.
-Charmed, I’m sure.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.290
You can call me Big Nose Kate.
Everybody else does.

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:47.400
No, it's not that big.
All kinds of reasons a person gets a name.

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.560
I couldn't agree more, ma’am.

01:29:49.730 --> 01:29:53.970
This is my brother Virgil, Bat Masterson.
Doc Holliday.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:59.540
Bat Masterson. You're the man
that killed Sergeant King in Sweetwater.

01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:02.550
Got you in the leg, I understand.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:08.580
My congratulations to you, sir.
King was a skunk of the first order.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.290
I wish you'd got him
before he shot poor Molly Brennan.

01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:17.530
-She was a sweet girl.
-Yes, she was, ma’am.

01:30:17.690 --> 01:30:21.930
-So, what brings you to Dodge City, Doc?
-I guess I missed you, Wyatt.

01:30:22.090 --> 01:30:24.130
This is where the money is.

01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:26.340
Anything else?

01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:31.780
Well, perhaps you've heard, we had
an unfortunate incident in Fort Griffin...

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:35.540
... entirely beyond our control.

01:30:35.710 --> 01:30:38.590
It seemed a good time to move on.

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.930
Hope we won't have anything
unfortunate happen in Dodge.

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.320
Oh, likewise, I’m sure.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.630
I’ll be checking my gun
as soon as we find a suitable hotel.

01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:52.790
I look forward
to more civilized surroundings.

01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:54.690
Gentlemen.

01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:03.340
Wyatt...

01:31:03.670 --> 01:31:06.620
... maybe he ought to check his knife too.

01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:10.850
I heard he cut that man in Texas
from his belly to his dick.

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.360
Bob.

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:42.680
Don't know what you want, Wyatt.
This setup seems pretty sweet to me.

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:47.220
We're making good money. Looks like
we'll get a piece of the Alhambra Faro Bank.

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:51.290
There's never been a man that got rich
working on a salary, that much I’ve learned.

01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:55.490
If you wanted to get rich,
you went into the wrong line of work.

01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:57.790
That's what I’m saying.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.730
Think it's gonna be any different
in Tombstone?

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:04.970
Can't say, but there's silver there.
And opportunity.

01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:06.840
The town's booming, Virgil.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.670
They're gonna need saloons, stage lines,
hotels, you name it.

01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:13.570
Wyatt...

01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:19.120
... did it ever occur to you that maybe we're
doing the only thing we're any good at?

01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:46.740
-Goodbye, Allie.
-Bye.

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.880
I’ll see you a little later.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.070
-What's this all about?
-I don't know.

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:58.150
-Where you going?
-Allie says they wanna talk to you alone.

01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:07.330
-Wyatt.
-Allie.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.060
Wyatt.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.040
Thanks for coming, Wyatt.

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:27.610
You're probably wondering
what this is about.

01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:30.050
You're damn right.

01:34:30.610 --> 01:34:33.250
We've been talking.
We like it here in Dodge.

01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:36.650
We want you to stop talking to our
husbands about going to Tombstone.

01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:41.060
All that nonsense about mining claims
and starting your own businesses.

01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:44.330
They all listen to you, Wyatt.
They'll do what you say.

01:34:44.490 --> 01:34:45.930
I know Morgan will.

01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:52.170
We'd like you to just leave
well enough alone.

01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:55.110
Just for once,
let the Earps settle down somewhere.

01:34:57.370 --> 01:34:58.710
Is that right?

01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:04.720
You brought me here to tell me that
without my brothers?

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:18.270
-Stop talking and start shooting.
-They're upstairs.

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:22.870
-It’s that goddamn Holliday and his whore!
-Where is it? Where'd you put it?

01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:31.040
Never again, you bastard! You've raised
your hand to me for the last time!

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.740
Kate! It’s Wyatt!
I’m coming in!

01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:37.940
Don't shoot me!

01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:43.050
Where'd you hide it?

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.260
Come on, little dove.

01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:50.330
Let's finally get it over with.

01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:54.240
Don't think I won't,
you skinny heap of pus.

01:35:58.030 --> 01:36:00.940
I won't have you hit me ever again.

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.050
Put that gun down, Kate.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.740
I don't want you shooting me by mistake.

01:36:06.370 --> 01:36:09.720
Year after year, sleeping in his bed...

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:12.720
... breathing the diseased air
he coughs up all night!

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.190
No one else would come near him!
This is what I get!

01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:18.590
This is his idea of a fair hand!

01:36:19.650 --> 01:36:23.760
-You won't be shooting him tonight, Kate.
-Let her do it.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.870
They can hang the bitch.
We'll both be happy.

01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:56.360
-What's wrong with you?
-What's wrong with me?

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.590
What have you got?

01:36:59.530 --> 01:37:02.800
I am dying of tuberculosis.

01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:07.570
Everyone who knows me hates me.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.010
I sleep with the nastiest whore
in Kansas...

01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:15.170
... and every morning I wake up surprised.

01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:21.050
Surprised I have to spend another day
in this piss-hole world.

01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:24.050
Not everybody that knows you hates you.

01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:29.690
What were you fighting about this time?

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.900
I don't recall.

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:39.600
But like most times, when Kate and l
disagree, we set to killing each other.

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:50.180
All of you can kiss my rebel dick.

01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:02.030
I know sometimes it isn't easy
being my friend...

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.430
... but I’ll be there when you need me.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.240
They say it was the biggest funeral
in the history of Dodge.

01:38:15.570 --> 01:38:17.840
Of course, the town ain't that old.

01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:21.920
People liked Ed.

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.110
We've covered some ground, haven't we?

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:32.430
What is it, Wyatt?

01:38:33.490 --> 01:38:36.300
I’ve had it with being a lawman, Bat.

01:38:37.090 --> 01:38:39.660
Had enough of being famous.

01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:42.900
I’m sick of Dodge.

01:38:43.130 --> 01:38:48.040
What are you two doing?
Can't you wait to get in here?

01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:50.770
We're saying goodbye.

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:54.480
I’m leaving Dodge, Doc.

01:38:55.070 --> 01:39:00.150
-Hallelujah. I’ll drink to that.
-I’m gonna settle down...

01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:04.230
... start some kind of business
where nobody wants to shoot me anymore.

01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:07.130
My brothers and I are going.

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.630
You're both welcome to come along.

01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:13.900
-Where is that?
-Tombstone, Arizona.

01:39:14.090 --> 01:39:15.590
Tombstone.

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:21.170
It does sound quiet, I’ll give you that.

01:39:33.010 --> 01:39:35.220
The man we've been waiting for.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.490
-Come on in.
-Here you go.

01:39:38.650 --> 01:39:41.100
-Set it right down on that bench, son.
-Okay.

01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:43.790
Our savior has arrived.

01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:47.200
Oh, yeah. Here you go.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:50.310
-Thank you, Mr. Earp.
-You're welcome.

01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:57.610
Morg, honey, food's ready.

01:39:57.770 --> 01:40:00.910
-Come on, sweetie.
-I’ll be right there, little darling.

01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:03.080
I’m gonna be sick.

01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:07.120
Wyatt, the food's on the table.

01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:13.390
Good, Mattie. That way we'll know
where to find it when we're finished.

01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:15.430
Morg.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.500
In mining claims, we got the Mountain Maid
Mine, the Mattie Blaylock, the Grasshopper.

01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.660
Why haven't you named a mine after me?

01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:28.000
They will, Lou.
They're gonna call the next one the Idiot.

01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:34.410
-Damn it, Bessie, you know something--
-Bessie, shut up and have yourself a drink.

01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:37.450
Go ahead, Wyatt.

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:42.520
We're about 50-50
between the mines that are producing...

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:44.590
-... and the mines that are--
-Worthless.

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.220
That are not producing.

01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:50.800
In other words, we ain't seen
a dime's profit from the lot.

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.630
Not "in other words,” James.
Those are the words.

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:58.130
Incomes, we got our salaries...

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.950
... plus James' Sampling Room, and
a half interest in the Oriental Faro Bank...

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.640
... and a quarter interest in one
at the Crystal Palace.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.650
From the sound of it, you'd think
we'd have some money by now.

01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:11.750
I’m afraid we're about as rich
as lawmen are ever gonna be.

01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:14.690
When you get through with the talk,
that's what we are.

01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:18.050
That's good enough for me, sweetheart.
I married you for your looks.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:21.090
I guess you lost out all around.

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.300
We have close to $14,000 cash
between us.

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:30.570
Why don't we just split it up,
and everybody do what they like?

01:41:31.130 --> 01:41:33.970
What we've gotta decide
is how to invest it.

01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:36.410
Don't you ignore me, Wyatt.

01:41:36.570 --> 01:41:40.040
If somebody voted you king of this family,
I didn't hear about it.

01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:44.710
You dragged us down here with a lot of talk
about owning businesses and getting rich.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:49.920
Now here you are a year later, a bunch of
lawmen and bartenders, just like before.

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.960
Some things haven't worked out
like we'd like. That's nobody's fault.

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:58.000
-We didn't come here to split up stakes.
-We're trying to build something.

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:01.570
Why does it always have to be
the brothers together?

01:42:01.730 --> 01:42:04.760
Why can't it just be you and me, James?

01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:12.910
They're afraid to say anything,
but they're thinking the same as me.

01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:17.490
We are your wives. Don't we ever count
more than the damn brothers?

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.590
No, Bessie, you don't.

01:42:20.250 --> 01:42:22.750
Wives come and go,
that's the plain truth of it.

01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:24.790
They run off.

01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:27.790
They die.

01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:35.530
You're a cold man, Wyatt Earp.

01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:38.370
God forgive you, you are cold.

01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:47.210
Morgan.

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:07.040
I’m sorry if I hurt you today.

01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:11.200
That was not my intention.

01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:17.880
Let's have children, Wyatt.

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:21.680
-Mattie.
-You're always talking about family.

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:28.150
Well, let's have children. A family
of our own. Our children, yours and mine.

01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:30.850
Before I’m too old for it.

01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:35.360
Before I dry up inside.
I can feel it, Wyatt.

01:43:35.890 --> 01:43:38.660
A part of me is starting to die.

01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:41.060
It’s not too late.

01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:46.130
Children aren't a part
of the bargain, Mattie.

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.480
They never were.

01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:19.670
They're no good.

01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:03.710
--that you, Frank Stillwell,
and you, Pete Spence...

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.880
... did, on the evening of September 8,
1881, rob the Sandy Bob stagecoach...

01:45:08.050 --> 01:45:11.080
... on the road from Tombstone to Bisbee.
How do you plead?

01:45:11.250 --> 01:45:15.060
-Not guilty. And that's not all I gotta say!
-You'll get your chance.

01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:17.890
-Spence?
-I didn't do nothing, judge.

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:21.400
It’s all a setup job by those damn Earps
and Marshal White.

01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:24.510
Look at me, judge.
This is the way they treat you...

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:27.870
...when you come nice and easy-like
to defend your good name.

01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:31.740
-Nice and easy, my ass.
-Quiet, everyone.

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:35.910
Now, there's enough evidence
and eyewitnesses to warrant an indictment.

01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:40.220
I’ll set your bail at $7000 each.

01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.650
-Have you the means?
-They got it!

01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:46.820
We'll stand that money, judge.

01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:50.160
Get them away from these bastards.
before they're lynched!

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.560
There ain't an honest cowboy
can get a fair shake in this town.

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:56.330
First, why don't you show me
an honest cowboy?

01:45:56.490 --> 01:46:00.840
Enough! The next man that speaks out
will be fined $25 contempt of court.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.470
Your Honor, $25 wouldn't pay for half
the contempt I got for this court.

01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:11.480
Bailiff, collect $50 from Curly Bill Brocius.

01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:20.450
Well...

01:46:20.850 --> 01:46:23.390
... didn't take them long
to get back on the road.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.760
The Clantons and the McLaurys
paid their bail. It’s the law.

01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:31.840
-The same for them as it is for you or me.
-Then I guess it don't work too well, John.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.760
Ike, what happened?

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.400
You're a little late, Johnny.

01:47:04.130 --> 01:47:07.110
What is wrong with you, Fred?
Why didn't you send word...

01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:10.710
-...when you caught up with them?
-Didn't know where you were.

01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:14.750
I’m the county sheriff!
Those men were caught in my jurisdiction.

01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:18.910
-I should've been at that hearing.
-They had enough friends there as it was.

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:21.850
We've been all over hell
looking for those two.

01:47:22.210 --> 01:47:24.750
Maybe you weren't looking
hard enough, Johnny.

01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:28.660
All over hell, huh?

01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:32.130
Sounds like your jurisdiction, all right.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.550
The outlaw's best friend
would like a word with you.

01:47:58.250 --> 01:48:02.250
-Hold your bets for the new dealer.
-All right, place your bets.

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.380
-Just tonight, Wyatt. To peace.
-No exceptions.

01:48:16.530 --> 01:48:18.510
No exceptions.

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.380
-That about sums you up, doesn't it?
-What's on your mind?

01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:29.820
You're headed for war with Ike Clanton
and the men he rides with.

01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:31.890
And it's all over nothing.

01:48:32.050 --> 01:48:35.400
You and Ike want the same things.
The same things we all want.

01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:38.190
-Really?
-That's right. To prosper.

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.560
To have some security for our family.

01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:45.140
You did not come to Tombstone
to be a lawman again, Wyatt.

01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:48.110
You are an entrepreneur.

01:48:48.270 --> 01:48:50.770
You're full of ideas
for making the Earps rich.

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.010
Nothing good
can come from you interfering...

01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:57.020
...with the business of the Clantons
and the McLaurys.

01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:58.980
Only blood.

01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:05.560
But with a little cooperation,
a little "live and let live"...

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:08.030
... everyone can make out.

01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:10.960
-How's that?
-Money, lots of money...

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:13.260
...to be shared with everyone
who helped.

01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:16.100
I know you.

01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:20.330
-That's what you've always been after.
-You've forgotten something.

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:25.070
-The Clantons and their friends are rustlers.
-What do you care what they do?

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:30.240
-They don't tell you how to run your games.
-They're murderers and thieves.

01:49:30.410 --> 01:49:33.750
They rob the stagecoaches
my brothers and I are paid to protect.

01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:37.860
One of those bastards shot Bud Philpot,
who never did a thing to anybody--

01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:42.230
Your best friend Doc Holliday
is one of the worst killers in this territory.

01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:45.630
Some people say he was in on that robbery
that got Bud killed.

01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:49.240
-Hell, even Big Nose Kate said it.
-That was your work, Johnny.

01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:54.110
You got her drunk and mad to say that.
And I’m sick of hearing your lies!

01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:57.840
Go to your friends. Tell them, if they
wanna make a fight with the Earps...

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
...they know where to find us!

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.760
Good morning, Maria.

01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:31.400
-Morning, George.
-Good morning, Virgil.

01:50:31.570 --> 01:50:33.380
How are you, George?

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:35.310
Look at Behan.

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:39.890
He'd lick himself all over if he could,
he's so whipped up.

01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:44.020
-What's with him?
-His woman's coming back...

01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:48.720
...from San Francisco on the Prescott stage.
A Jewish girl.

01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:52.030
I never knew him to have one woman.

01:50:52.190 --> 01:50:56.760
-Guess you haven't seen her yet, Wyatt.
-Oh, he's been busy while she was gone...

01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:00.080
... but I reckon he stay home tonight.

01:52:04.830 --> 01:52:07.210
-Evening, miss.
-Good evening.

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.570
Are you taking a walk?

01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:13.080
I am.

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:14.650
Is that a problem?

01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.380
Could be in this town.

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.890
A young woman walking alone
in the evening...

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:22.180
... people could get
the wrong impression.

01:52:22.810 --> 01:52:26.560
What impression would that be?
Far as I know, the red light district...

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:30.060
-... is the other end of town.
-I didn't mean to imply that.

01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:32.600
It’s just that you should have an escort.

01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:37.660
Well, Mr. Earp, I can either be a shut-in
or walk alone on the streets of Tombstone.

01:52:39.730 --> 01:52:42.340
I appreciate your concern.

01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:47.750
I saw you once before.

01:52:48.670 --> 01:52:51.380
Before you came to Tombstone,
in Dodge City.

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:54.120
You were in a show.

01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:58.530
I know. I saw you too.

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:02.000
I saw you, and then you killed a man.

01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:17.640
So I said:

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:20.010
"What are you afraid of, darling?

01:53:20.170 --> 01:53:24.310
You're not some Red Injun that thinks
the camera's gonna steal your soul. "

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:27.080
And she said, "No, Johnny.

01:53:27.250 --> 01:53:30.780
I’m afraid that someone besides you
might see it. "

01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:34.100
But I assured her
that would never happen.

01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:40.240
-Bob, you seen James around?
-Not lately, I haven't.

01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:42.460
Wyatt, you gotta take a look at this.

01:53:42.630 --> 01:53:48.480
Danny, I am sure Marshal Earp
is too upstanding, righteous...

01:53:48.630 --> 01:53:51.200
... and married...

01:53:51.370 --> 01:53:55.720
...to be interested in a naked picture
of a young Jewish woman.

01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:03.420
-You're a damn fool, Behan.
-Maybe.

01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:06.960
But I’m the fool that climbs into bed
with that every night.

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:12.530
-What's she doing with you, Johnny?
-Just about anything I can think of.

01:54:14.290 --> 01:54:16.830
How much detail do you want?

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:22.570
It ain't right, shooting a man
when he don't know it's coming.

01:54:22.730 --> 01:54:27.110
-I’ll give him one in the face just for you.
-You ain't doing any shooting tonight.

01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:30.510
That's Curly Bill's job. Frank?

01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:43.130
-Where's the commotion, Frank?
-Don't worry about that. Got a spot?

01:54:43.290 --> 01:54:45.990
-Yeah, I got one.
-We're close.

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:55.710
I don't know if I like that one or not.
It’s not quite my style.

01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:58.870
-I like that hat.
-The black one?

01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:04.350
All right, boys, let her rip.

01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:12.120
Wait for me at home.

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:25.500
Clanton, move!

01:55:41.150 --> 01:55:44.720
All right, boys, that's enough.
Put down the guns.

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.620
Drop them.

01:55:51.890 --> 01:55:55.860
That'll be enough fun for now, Bill.
Hand it over.

01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:08.270
Damn, you can't have a little fun
in this town.

01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:29.630
Whether it was just some drunken fun
that got out of control...

01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:34.500
... a mistake, as you say, you were
just trying to hand over your firearm...

01:56:34.670 --> 01:56:37.240
...when it accidentally discharged...

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:40.870
... or whether it was another heinous crime,
carefully planned...

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.950
... and maliciously premeditated, we'll have
to wait for a jury of your peers to decide.

01:56:47.110 --> 01:56:49.520
But what we know already is this...

01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:53.730
... you have robbed the people of Tombstone
of a precious resource.

01:56:54.450 --> 01:56:58.900
Fred White was a brave lawman,
a loving father and husband...

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:05.100
... a loyal friend and a good man,
which you, William Brocius, are not.

01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:10.840
Your bail is set at $ 1 5, 000.
Virgil, you're the acting marshal now.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.140
Take him out of my sight.

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:38.230
-Behan's not here.
-I’m not looking for Johnny.

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.610
He's horseshit.

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:45.100
We found something to agree on.

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.280
Maybe you've heard about
the private photograph...

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.680
... my former fiancé was showing around?

01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:54.980
Or maybe you've seen it.

01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.190
It seems every man in town has.

01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:04.890
-You shouldn't be in here.
-I’ve been in worse places than this.

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:11.270
You mean you want me
to go somewhere with you?

01:58:21.710 --> 01:58:23.850
I heard a story about you.

01:58:24.010 --> 01:58:26.510
About you and a prisoner
named Tommy O'Rourke.

01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:29.350
Tommy Behind-the-Deuce,
they called him.

01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:33.790
Is it true what they say?
How you saved him?

01:58:37.150 --> 01:58:39.690
People make up a lot of things.

01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:42.890
Sometimes even I don't know
what really happened.

01:58:43.590 --> 01:58:45.540
I know this though...

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:48.040
...the stories are always better.

01:58:50.970 --> 01:58:53.210
Is Mattie Earp your wife?

01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:59.080
We've been together a while.

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.420
She uses my name.

01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:03.790
I owe her that at the least.

01:59:06.250 --> 01:59:09.200
I’m not gonna marry Johnny Behan.

01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:11.660
I never thought you would.

01:59:13.490 --> 01:59:17.130
-What would you know about it, Mr. Earp?
-Wyatt.

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.640
You don't know anything about me.

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:23.300
I knew a lot about you
the minute you got off that stagecoach.

01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:25.310
Like what?

01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:27.780
That you're a brave young woman.

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:31.910
That you came out to a place like this
on your own...

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:34.520
...to a man you knew
wasn't right for you...

01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:37.390
... because you liked the adventure
of it all.

01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:40.460
I’ve never been afraid of much.

01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:43.520
You're afraid to say my name.

01:59:43.890 --> 01:59:46.330
Why would I be afraid of that?

01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:51.260
Because you know once you do,
that'll be it.

01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:56.770
You've got a lot of confidence, Mr. Earp.

02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:04.710
I believe you're trying to seduce me.

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.220
What do people call you?

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:11.090
Josie.

02:00:12.150 --> 02:00:13.460
Josie.

02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:19.630
What makes you different from all the men
who've tried what you're trying?

02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:23.030
-I guess you know, Josie.
-No, I don't.

02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:26.440
Then say it.

02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:29.030
All right.

02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:31.910
I don't know what you're talking about...

02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:34.840
... Wyatt.

02:01:01.630 --> 02:01:03.670
Come on, Brocius, let's go.

02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.840
Come on!

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.810
Get on your horse, Bill,
before they shoot you down in cold blood.

02:01:13.610 --> 02:01:18.180
You had your last chance, and you let it go.
There ain't gonna be no more talking.

02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:21.460
-You talk too much for a fighting man, Ike.
-Wyatt.

02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:25.430
I’ve seen your kind my whole life.
There's never been but one way...

02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:29.970
-...to deal with any of you.
-Your day is coming. Get ready.

02:01:30.130 --> 02:01:32.500
Why not make it today?

02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:37.500
I cannot speak for everyone,
but personally...

02:01:37.670 --> 02:01:43.380
... I am getting sick to my stomach
of all your empty yellow talk.

02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:49.450
If you wanna make a fight
with these boys, why not get it over with...

02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:53.790
-... right now?
-You're the first on my list, Holliday.

02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:56.400
Spend the rest of your time
waiting to see me.

02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:58.830
McLaury, seeing you
would be a nice change.

02:01:58.990 --> 02:02:02.730
I understand most of your enemies
got it in the back.

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:06.500
We ain't through.

02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:22.220
I think we ought to just kill them all.

02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:29.690
You know, Morg, Wyatt's my friend,
but I believe I’m beginning to love you.

02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:36.720
Wyatt, tell me about Missouri.

02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:41.700
I loved a girl, Josie.

02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:47.340
I loved her more than I’ll ever love
anyone else as long as I live.

02:03:49.630 --> 02:03:53.670
I married her, and we were
going to have a child, and she died.

02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:57.680
And our child with her.

02:03:59.110 --> 02:04:01.820
I wanted to die too.

02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:05.930
I burned everything we owned.

02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:08.730
The pictures...

02:04:08.890 --> 02:04:12.130
...the baby clothes she'd made...

02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:14.890
... ribbons from her hair.

02:04:16.630 --> 02:04:20.770
I tried to burn out everything
I’d felt back there.

02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:29.120
Wyatt...

02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:35.590
... I’m not asking for any more
than you can give me.

02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:40.190
I just wanna be close to you.

02:04:51.530 --> 02:04:55.670
I wanna be lying here
next to you when we're 80.

02:04:57.870 --> 02:05:01.010
I never thought about living that long.

02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:09.220
But if I do, you can bet
all I’ll be doing is lying here.

02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:14.190
Then we better not waste any time.

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:34.310
Wyatt, I think you better come with me.

02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:42.680
Doc Goodfellow says she's gonna be okay.

02:05:42.850 --> 02:05:45.690
She took a dose of laudanum
with her whiskey.

02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:50.020
It looks like she was trying to kill herself.

02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:54.760
Lucky we found her in time.
Lucky somebody came around.

02:05:57.690 --> 02:06:00.640
Where would she get this?

02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:05.710
Probably over in Chinatown.
It’s not hard to find in Tombstone.

02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:14.590
Mattie.

02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:18.320
Mattie.

02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:25.100
Go back to your Jew whore.

02:06:42.070 --> 02:06:45.080
If I was married to him,
I'd drink a gallon of the stuff.

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:48.090
Allie, shut up.

02:06:58.290 --> 02:07:00.430
It's all right, dear.

02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.770
Wyatt.

02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:15.680
-Give me a bottle and a glass, Clem.
-What?

02:07:16.610 --> 02:07:18.680
Don't make me ask you twice.

02:07:29.590 --> 02:07:32.530
Gentlemen, this game is losing its allure.

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.630
I'm out.

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:44.670
Don't mind if I do.

02:07:48.270 --> 02:07:52.150
If you're gonna break the fast,
the least you can do is invite a friend.

02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:56.280
-I’m not in the mood for talking, Doc.
-You know how it is with me.

02:07:57.380 --> 02:08:01.420
You don't have to do much talking
when I’m around.

02:08:04.590 --> 02:08:08.470
Wyatt, you ever wonder
why we've been a part...

02:08:08.630 --> 02:08:13.730
... of so many unfortunate incidents,
yet we're still walking around?

02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:16.600
I have figured it out.

02:08:16.770 --> 02:08:20.080
It’s nothing much, just luck.

02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:24.080
And you know why
it's nothing much, Wyatt?

02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:30.720
Because it doesn't matter much
whether we're here today or not.

02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:35.420
I wake up every morning looking
in the face of death, and you know what?

02:08:35.590 --> 02:08:37.500
He ain't half bad.

02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:45.410
I think the secret
old Mr. Death is holding...

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:50.410
... is that it's better for some of us
over on the other side.

02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:54.110
I know it can't be any worse for me.

02:08:55.670 --> 02:08:58.910
Maybe that's the place for your Mattie.

02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:08.950
For some people
this world ain't ever gonna be right.

02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.080
Is that supposed to let me off the hook?

02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:43.660
There is no hook, my friend.

02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:47.700
There's only what we do.

02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:07.190
Well, it won't be for long.

02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:11.520
After tomorrow, this town's
gonna smell a whole lot better.

02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:16.190
-Ike, why don't you slow down on that?
-Don't tell me to slow down.

02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:18.490
I’ve waited long enough as it is.

02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:21.000
Those Earps and their skinny
diseased friend...

02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:24.040
... are gonna find out
what a real fight is all about.

02:10:24.190 --> 02:10:25.900
I’m moving on.

02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:29.130
If you're smart, you'll go back
to the hotel to get some sleep.

02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:33.210
You're gonna need some help
if you're gonna take on the Earps.

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:39.950
I got friends. They're coming
tomorrow. You'll see.

02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:48.150
And then this town is gonna
thank us for what we done.

02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:53.230
Ike, if you're gonna talk like that,
you'd best take it somewheres else.

02:10:56.490 --> 02:10:58.100
Good evening.

02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:02.570
-How you fellas doing?
-Not bad. Good to see you.

02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:25.100
Shut up, I’m tired of hearing your noise.

02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:28.930
Ike.

02:11:31.330 --> 02:11:33.240
I hear you're gonna kill me.

02:11:34.030 --> 02:11:37.770
-Get out your gun and commence.
-I ain't heeled, Doc.

02:11:37.930 --> 02:11:41.240
You scum-sucking bastard,
if you ain't heeled, go and arm yourself.

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.440
I shall meet you in the street.

02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:49.450
-Who'll give this yellow-bellied prick a gun?
-Doc. Doc, that's enough.

02:11:49.610 --> 02:11:53.620
I ain't gonna fight you tonight, Doc,
but your fight's coming soon enough.

02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:57.990
My mama always told me never put off
till tomorrow people you can kill today.

02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:02.470
-Doc, he ain't armed, and he's drunk.
-There ain't no law against killing drunks.

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:08.030
If you intend to open your lying mouth
about me or my friends again...

02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:10.770
...then go heeled and ready to fight!

02:13:08.090 --> 02:13:11.300
-Josie, what are you doing here?
-Ike Clanton's been going around...

02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:14.840
... saying they're gonna shoot
the first Earp who shows his face.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.410
Just Ike?

02:13:19.570 --> 02:13:25.350
Wyatt, come away with me now.
We'll leave the trouble behind and go.

02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:28.680
-Leave? I’m not gonna leave.
-Please, Wyatt.

02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:32.050
I don't wanna see you shot down
in a street fight I don't understand.

02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.290
This is where we live.

02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:38.330
My brothers and me,
we've staked it all on this place.

02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:42.090
It’s nothing, Wyatt. It’s a mining camp,
dirty and small-minded.

02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:44.360
It’s our home...

02:13:44.530 --> 02:13:46.670
... and I’m not leaving, Josie.

02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:50.510
Not for the Clantons
or the McLaurys or anybody.

02:13:51.130 --> 02:13:53.240
Not even you.

02:13:55.470 --> 02:13:57.750
Then give me a gun.

02:13:58.510 --> 02:14:01.550
Give me a gun, I’ll kill anyone
who tries to hurt you.

02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:06.960
Go home, Josie.

02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:11.930
Thinking about you could get me killed.

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:15.430
Wyatt.

02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:18.740
I love you, Wyatt.

02:14:33.110 --> 02:14:36.850
If you leave me, I’ll kill myself.

02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:41.990
I’ll do it this time, I swear.

02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:47.470
I swear before God Almighty
I will kill myself. It'll be on your head.

02:14:48.530 --> 02:14:50.400
Do you hear me?

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:55.630
If you don't break off with that whore,
you will come back and find me dead.

02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:03.480
Talk to me,
you cold-hearted son of a bitch.

02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:07.640
There are men out there
I may have to kill, Mattie.

02:15:07.810 --> 02:15:10.790
I don't have time for this today.

02:15:29.770 --> 02:15:31.970
Virg.

02:15:50.450 --> 02:15:53.490
Marshal, they're around there, sir.

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:10.340
You heard?

02:16:11.710 --> 02:16:13.950
You know how many?

02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:20.550
I wonder if Curly Bill
and them boys come in.

02:16:31.730 --> 02:16:35.299
-What did you hear?
-Ike's been up all night drinking...

02:16:35.469 --> 02:16:38.670
...trying to screw up
the courage to kill us.

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:42.580
Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury,
and Billy Claiborne came in this morning.

02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:47.150
-Curly Bill? Indian Charlie?
-I don't know, Morg.

02:16:47.309 --> 02:16:48.910
Could be anybody's here.

02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:53.250
-Where's Holliday?
-He hasn't been around.

02:16:54.650 --> 02:16:57.530
All right, let him sleep.

02:16:57.690 --> 02:17:00.190
How do you wanna handle this, Wyatt?

02:17:01.090 --> 02:17:03.590
I’m gonna have some coffee.

02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:16.040
-Give me one of those cigars.
-Sure.

02:17:28.889 --> 02:17:31.730
Is there gonna be a fight, Wyatt?

02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:37.959
I think there must be.

02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:56.420
Do you want some help?

02:17:58.410 --> 02:18:00.420
Thanks, Clem.

02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:26.650
They just moved out
of the O. K. Corral down by Fly's.

02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:30.250
It looks like Ike and Billy Clanton...

02:18:30.410 --> 02:18:35.360
...the McLaurys, Billy Claiborne.
Maybe more.

02:18:46.830 --> 02:18:48.040
Let's go.

02:19:08.889 --> 02:19:11.889
Where the hell are you going?

02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:18.000
-We're going down the street.
-I think I’ll join you.

02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:31.480
We intend to disarm them
and take them in, Doc. You understand?

02:19:31.639 --> 02:19:36.750
Oh, I understand, Virgil,
but do you think they will?

02:19:41.650 --> 02:19:44.100
Put that under your coat.

02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:48.600
No use provoking them
until we get a chance to talk.

02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:52.930
Hell, I’ve heard enough talk already.

02:20:56.860 --> 02:20:59.170
There is likely to be some trouble.

02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:10.910
Now hold on here.

02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:15.950
-Don't go down there. There'll be trouble.
-We're just gonna take their guns.

02:21:16.110 --> 02:21:18.650
No. No, there's no need for that,
I disarmed them.

02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:21.630
Then there won't be any trouble, Johnny.

02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:28.090
Let them have it.

02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:30.030
All right.

02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:49.010
You sons of bitches have been
looking for a fight. Now you can have it.

02:21:55.350 --> 02:21:57.520
Throw up your hands.

02:21:57.690 --> 02:21:59.430
I want your guns.

02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:21.110
No, Frank, don't shoot!

02:22:24.850 --> 02:22:26.880
Wyatt! Wyatt, no, I didn’t want this!

02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:31.720
I ain't armed! I ain't-- Billy!

02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:34.660
Billy, no! Billy!

02:23:00.420 --> 02:23:03.260
F rank! F rank!

02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:05.660
Frank.

02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:28.990
Look out. Get out of my way.

02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:35.560
Take them down to the house, Jack.

02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:39.160
Allie, don't let him move too much.

02:23:40.590 --> 02:23:43.400
Wyatt, I’m taking you in.

02:23:47.330 --> 02:23:50.310
No, he didn't. No, he didn't.

02:23:50.470 --> 02:23:52.810
Easy, Morg. Easy, Morg.

02:23:52.970 --> 02:23:55.210
-Where's Virg and Doc?
-Don't try and talk.

02:23:55.370 --> 02:23:56.850
-Where's the doctor?
-Yonder.

02:23:57.010 --> 02:23:59.540
Wyatt, I’m gonna have
to arrest you. Wyatt!

02:23:59.710 --> 02:24:03.420
Get him down to the house.
I’m not gonna be arrested today, Johnny.

02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:05.790
Not by you and not by anybody else.

02:24:05.950 --> 02:24:09.920
In the name of God, Wyatt,
there has been enough blood today.

02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:17.640
I reckon that's the Earp family business.

02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:21.530
Wyatt.

02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:28.010
-Oh, God, are you all right?
-I’m okay, Josie.

02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:30.170
-You go home now.
-No, I wanna stay--

02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:34.750
Josie, go home. It might not be over.

02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:37.790
-John, would you see her home?
-Miss, Wyatt's right.

02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:40.860
They murdered them!
Them Earps shot them in cold blood!

02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:45.330
Ike's been in here all morning threatening
to kill them. It was a fair fight!

02:24:45.490 --> 02:24:48.060
Break it up. Break it up.

02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:09.550
Everybody who's not family, get out.
Allie, clear this chair for her.

02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:13.890
-Don't tell me what to do in my own home.
-Allie.

02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:17.430
Men may be coming into town
to kill us all today.

02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:21.030
It’s not important what you think of me.
We have to cooperate.

02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:23.100
So clear the goddamn chair!

02:25:31.570 --> 02:25:33.010
What happened to her?

02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:36.380
This, a lot of it.

02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:39.150
Oh, Lord.

02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:42.290
Mattie. Come on, Mattie.

02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:46.120
Nobody by the house, Jack.

02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:49.420
It’s your fault this happened.

02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:54.770
I wanted to get away from here,
but he wouldn't leave you.

02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:59.810
You and your precious brothers.
Well, damn you to hell, Wyatt Earp.

02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:31.840
Well, here we are...

02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:35.630
... one big happy family.

02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:04.730
-Wyatt.
-John.

02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:09.660
-What are you doing here with him?
-Wyatt, I’m here as your friend.

02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:14.570
We have warrants for you, Doc, Morgan,
and Virgil for the crime of murder.

02:28:15.700 --> 02:28:18.870
Your brothers can stay here
until they recover...

02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:21.640
... but he's here to bring you in.

02:28:22.570 --> 02:28:25.980
Behan was afraid if he came
with his deputies, there'd be blood shed.

02:28:26.410 --> 02:28:32.090
-Johnny's not as dumb as I thought.
-Wyatt, the warrants are legal.

02:28:33.550 --> 02:28:37.330
I won't let them use the law
to kill me and my family, John.

02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:41.230
-I won't allow that.
-What'll it take, Wyatt?

02:28:43.730 --> 02:28:46.900
I need to know my family is safe.

02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:52.480
You boys are finally treating me
the way I deserve to be treated.

02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:54.740
-Let's drop him, Jack.
-You got it.

02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:58.580
-And that one's Wyatt's.
-I’ll come back for the rest of them.

02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:00.350
-Easy, now.
-Virg.

02:29:00.510 --> 02:29:02.720
Ain't no fire.

02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:06.550
-I don't wanna go to no hotel.
-We're all going.

02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:09.960
I don't wanna.
Where's my medicine?

02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:15.030
Did you take my medicine?
I want--I want my medicine.

02:29:20.930 --> 02:29:24.240
Allie, help her.

02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:25.710
-Calm down, dear.
-What?

02:29:25.870 --> 02:29:27.640
Tell me, what is it?

02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:30.410
-We got somebody on the roof?
-No.

02:29:30.570 --> 02:29:33.180
All right, put somebody up there, Sherm.

02:29:34.580 --> 02:29:38.120
No. No.

02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:42.060
You son of a bitch,
you've brought your whore.

02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:45.060
-Mattie.
-You think I haven't heard?

02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:48.260
You think I haven’t heard them
laughing behind my back.

02:29:48.420 --> 02:29:51.100
-Wyatt and his Heeb whore.
-Mattie!

02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:54.800
-I won't stay under the same roof with that.
-Don't you talk about me.

02:29:54.960 --> 02:30:00.210
-Who is she? I’m your wife.
-Goddamn it, that's enough!

02:30:00.370 --> 02:30:02.870
-Wyatt, I told you this would happen.
-Both of you!

02:30:04.110 --> 02:30:07.610
I’m your wife. I am.

02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:10.950
I’m your wife, Wyatt.

02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:15.290
Quiet, everyone.

02:30:15.450 --> 02:30:18.260
Quiet, please.

02:30:18.420 --> 02:30:22.870
In view of the controversies between
the Earps, Clantons and the McLaurys...

02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:26.840
... and the quarrel the night before
between Isaac Clanton and John Holliday...

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:31.040
... I am of the opinion that the defendant,
Virgil Earp, as chief of police...

02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:34.770
... subsequently calling upon his brothers
and Holliday to assist him...

02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:37.820
... in arresting and disarming
the Clantons and the McLaurys...

02:30:37.970 --> 02:30:40.950
... committed an injudicious
and censurable act.

02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:44.610
-No.
-Ridiculous. They were keeping the peace.

02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:50.160
Yet when you consider the existence
of a law-defying element in our midst...

02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:53.360
... and consider the many threats
made against the Earps...

02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:56.940
... I can attach no criminality
to his unwise act.

02:30:57.090 --> 02:31:01.060
Moreover, the evidence taken before me
in this case would not, in my judgment...

02:31:01.230 --> 02:31:05.840
...warrant a conviction of the defendants
by trial jury of any offense whatever.

02:31:06.270 --> 02:31:09.440
I order the defendants to be released.

02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:28.360
Lou.

02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:48.450
A blind man could have made that shot.

02:31:48.610 --> 02:31:51.590
Now you're gonna
have to show me something.

02:31:52.510 --> 02:31:55.150
Look who don't know
if he's coming or going.

02:31:55.320 --> 02:32:01.600
You're just in time to watch me
whip Bob's ass for, what, 50th time?

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:03.790
"Fiftieth time?"

02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:07.770
Wyatt, maybe you can answer a question
that's been dogging me for years.

02:32:07.930 --> 02:32:09.310
What's that?

02:32:09.470 --> 02:32:13.880
How come Morgan here is the only Earp
who's completely full of shit?

02:32:14.770 --> 02:32:18.380
Bob, the whole family wants to know
the answer to that one.

02:32:33.490 --> 02:32:36.730
-Get down. Hide yourself. Find a gun.
-Take that gun!

02:32:59.050 --> 02:33:03.860
-We sent for the doctor and Lou, Wyatt.
-It’s gonna be all right, Morg.

02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:11.030
Go find James and Virgil Earp. Go.

02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:22.480
Marshal Earp, you gotta come quick.

02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:24.310
It’s your brother, Morgan.

02:33:24.810 --> 02:33:29.380
-What's wrong?
-He's at Hatch's. Hurry.

02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:57.280
They got me, Wyatt.

02:33:59.070 --> 02:34:01.250
Don't let them get you.

02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:05.260
You're not gonna die on me, Morg.

02:34:05.410 --> 02:34:07.150
I won't let you.

02:34:10.990 --> 02:34:13.490
Set my legs out straight.

02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:20.840
They are, Morg.

02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:30.810
It won't be long now.

02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:35.510
-Where's Lou?
-She's coming.

02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:37.920
She's coming.

02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.220
Wyatt.

02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:08.080
I heard gunfire.
I came to see what's going on.

02:35:38.470 --> 02:35:40.480
No.

02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:46.220
No. No! No!

02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:23.630
How is he?

02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:27.270
You can see for yourself.

02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:32.570
Wyatt, he wants to take my arm.

02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:35.840
Don't let him cut it off.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
You heard him, doc.

02:36:38.670 --> 02:36:42.910
Either way he's gonna be a cripple,
if he doesn't bleed to death.

02:36:43.610 --> 02:36:46.020
At least I’ll be a two-armed corpse.

02:36:46.170 --> 02:36:49.120
Virg, please.

02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:54.420
You never mind. I still got
one good arm to hug you with.

02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:00.660
Where's Morgan?

02:37:06.190 --> 02:37:08.260
Where's Morgan?

02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:57.450
Careful.

02:37:58.810 --> 02:38:01.820
I don't want them taking a shot at you.

02:38:07.290 --> 02:38:09.000
I’m...

02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:14.270
... so sorry, Wyatt.

02:38:17.730 --> 02:38:20.110
I loved that boy...

02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:24.410
... like he was my own little brother.

02:38:40.390 --> 02:38:42.660
What do you wanna do?

02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:47.500
Kill them all.

02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:25.510
-Hold it right there.
-I was just going in.

02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:29.140
-Nobody's going in there.
-Well, I’m here to see Wyatt Earp.

02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:31.680
Who's here to see Wyatt Earp?

02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:34.650
It’s all right.

02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:47.090
I’ve come to help bring Morgan home
to Ma and Pa in California.

02:39:48.190 --> 02:39:50.570
I’m glad you're here, Warren.

02:40:03.070 --> 02:40:07.020
-It’s time to go now, Mattie.
-Sure, sugar.

02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:12.860
Off to California with the Earps.

02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:19.360
You're the only brother
that hasn't been shot.

02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:21.900
That's not fair.

02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:24.930
Wyatt!

02:40:25.090 --> 02:40:27.770
-Wyatt!
-It’s all right.

02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:31.300
It was an accident.

02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:39.610
Mattie.

02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:45.320
Mattie, if you wanna go on the train
with the others, you'll have to go now.

02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:48.680
I don't know when I’ll be back here.

02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:52.350
Go to hell.

02:40:54.090 --> 02:40:58.200
When you do come back, I’ll be gone.

02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:06.940
If you keep up with that stuff,
it'll kill you.

02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:10.780
What do you care?

02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:17.450
I don't anymore.

02:41:40.370 --> 02:41:42.210
John Holliday?

02:41:49.140 --> 02:41:50.780
Wyatt.

02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:53.820
It’s from Bob Paul in Tucson.

02:41:54.220 --> 02:41:57.990
He says Ike Clanton, Frank Stillwell,
and their friends are in Tucson.

02:41:58.150 --> 02:42:00.220
They've been watching the trains.

02:42:00.390 --> 02:42:03.890
Somebody in Tombstone
told them we were coming.

02:42:04.660 --> 02:42:06.300
Good.

02:42:17.010 --> 02:42:20.480
We'll go as far as Tucson,
get you out of the territory.

02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:23.590
You'll stay on the train
and help James and the women...

02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:26.280
... get Virgil and Morg
back to California.

02:42:26.450 --> 02:42:28.930
James and them can get Morgan back.

02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:32.860
Wyatt, if you're going after the men
that did this, I’m going with you.

02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:36.170
All aboard!

02:43:14.900 --> 02:43:16.340
Warren.

02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:18.570
James will watch the back door.

02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:20.740
You watch that one.

02:43:21.470 --> 02:43:25.010
Anybody tries to come on, shoot them.

02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:03.170
You murdered my brother.

02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:09.850
No!

02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:16.180
Yes.

02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:44.510
Wyatt!

02:46:45.010 --> 02:46:46.880
It’s me, Sherm.

02:46:51.210 --> 02:46:52.880
Wyatt.

02:46:55.450 --> 02:46:57.190
Wyatt!

02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:03.300
Okay, Wyatt.

02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:05.930
Let's go.

02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:32.490
It’s all right, Virgil.

02:47:33.090 --> 02:47:35.460
That's one for Morgan.

02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:37.590
Wyatt.

02:47:38.330 --> 02:47:40.170
Finish it.

02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:30.150
Marshal Earp.

02:48:30.610 --> 02:48:32.990
Thought you better take a look at this.

02:48:33.780 --> 02:48:36.190
I haven't shown it to Sheriff Behan yet.

02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:43.500
-Your brother was a good man.
-I’m grateful, Albert.

02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:48.770
They got a warrant out for us
on Stillwell already.

02:48:50.670 --> 02:48:54.480
-I guess everybody in Tucson saw us there.
-Oh, really?

02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:58.050
Even with you being so quiet and all?

02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:03.090
Better collect our things and go.

02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:07.560
Sherm, see if the two Jacks
will take a ride with us.

02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:14.830
Wyatt.

02:49:14.990 --> 02:49:18.030
-You're still a marshal here, ain't you?
-Sure.

02:49:18.590 --> 02:49:22.470
But now he's gonna be
a marshal and an outlaw.

02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:25.580
The best of both worlds, son.

02:49:39.250 --> 02:49:41.390
I missed you.

02:49:46.750 --> 02:49:50.060
I want you to go home to your folks
in San Francisco.

02:49:51.230 --> 02:49:53.970
When I can, I’ll come and get you.

02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:56.700
When will that be?

02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:01.780
I have some men I have to see.

02:50:01.940 --> 02:50:04.810
I don't know where that'll take me.

02:50:08.810 --> 02:50:11.760
I’ll be expecting you every day.

02:50:20.490 --> 02:50:23.260
-I’m broke. You know that.
-It doesn't matter.

02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:26.300
There's nothing left to hold you here.

02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:28.770
There's....

02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:33.270
I was gonna say my family.

02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:40.840
I’ll be your family, Wyatt.

02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:44.620
I’ll give you children.

02:50:45.010 --> 02:50:48.690
We'll make our own place
where no one will find us.

02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:51.600
And I won't die on you.

02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:55.190
I swear it.

02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:07.310
You were right, Josie.

02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:10.440
We stayed too long.

02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:21.560
You couldn't have been trying to
arrest him. Not with 20 bullets in him.

02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:24.660
No, I wasn’t trying to arrest him.

02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:27.290
I don't know what to say to that.

02:51:27.460 --> 02:51:29.630
This is my will, John.

02:51:30.090 --> 02:51:33.370
I’ve named you as executor.
Not that there's much left.

02:51:33.530 --> 02:51:36.010
This is not a jungle, Wyatt.
We have laws.

02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:38.110
Yes, we do.

02:51:38.500 --> 02:51:42.910
If those men think they can hide behind
those laws, then they've missed their guess.

02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:48.490
Goodbye, John.

02:51:59.090 --> 02:52:01.590
Wyatt. Wyatt.

02:52:01.890 --> 02:52:03.370
I wanna see you.

02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:07.200
Johnny, you're not careful,
you'll see me once too often.

02:52:46.700 --> 02:52:48.700
Looking for Pete Spence.

02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:51.910
He no here.

02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:54.550
Go to Tombstone.

02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:57.820
How about the one
they call Indian Charlie?

02:54:53.690 --> 02:54:56.000
Something bothering you?

02:54:56.560 --> 02:54:59.440
What makes you so sure
Ringo, Spence, and Curly Bill...

02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:02.210
... are with this pack
we're trailing now?

02:55:02.370 --> 02:55:05.980
-They're up here, all right.
-How do you know?

02:55:06.470 --> 02:55:10.680
-That's what Texas Jack's friend told me.
-Maybe he's wrong.

02:55:10.850 --> 02:55:13.920
Maybe it's just ordinary rustlers
out about their business.

02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:15.790
You gonna shoot all of them too?

02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:20.020
-You can take off whenever you want.
-Go to hell.

02:55:22.820 --> 02:55:26.100
You can't get what you want, Wyatt.

02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:28.740
You can't kill them all.

02:55:32.170 --> 02:55:33.440
Look...

02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:36.340
... I’m dead anyway.

02:55:36.500 --> 02:55:40.210
So if you wanna go out
in a blaze of glory...

02:55:40.370 --> 02:55:42.320
... I’m with you.

02:55:42.940 --> 02:55:44.390
But if you wanna live....

02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:47.750
What do you want me to do,
forget about it?

02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:51.530
Just wait.

02:55:52.090 --> 02:55:55.120
Get out of Arizona for a while.

02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:58.000
Make them think it's over.

02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:01.330
Then we'll come back later.
We'll pick them off...

02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:03.870
... one at a time.

02:56:20.410 --> 02:56:23.160
You need to go to Colorado.

02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:27.760
One of those sanitariums
in the mountains.

02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:32.200
I’ll go...

02:56:32.890 --> 02:56:35.100
... if you'll take me.

02:56:39.930 --> 02:56:42.380
You've been a good friend to me, Doc.

02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:45.840
Shut up.

02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:37.130
Johnny Ringo!

02:58:48.200 --> 02:58:51.570
Wyatt, let's get out of here!

03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:34.140
Show me where our gold is, Wyatt.

03:00:34.500 --> 03:00:36.410
Point it out.

03:00:44.140 --> 03:00:46.060
Right there.

03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:50.400
Well, that doesn't look so tough.

03:00:51.790 --> 03:00:56.760
No, I imagine we can pick most of it up
in just a day's excursion out of Nome.

03:00:57.460 --> 03:01:00.730
The problem will be
lugging it back to town.

03:01:08.140 --> 03:01:11.120
What are we gonna do with all our money?

03:01:14.740 --> 03:01:16.810
We'll buy you a new suit.

03:01:16.980 --> 03:01:18.920
You could use one.

03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:22.120
Excuse me. I’m sorry to bother...

03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:25.390
... but are you by any chance Wyatt Earp?

03:01:28.220 --> 03:01:32.170
My name's Francis O'Rourke. I believe
you saved my uncle's life one time...

03:01:32.330 --> 03:01:33.960
... in Tombstone, Arizona.

03:01:34.430 --> 03:01:38.640
That's the story my father told us,
anyway, many times. Believe me.

03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:43.870
-This is my wife, Josie.
-It’s an honor, ma’am.

03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:46.780
I’m afraid my husband
has saved so many lives...

03:01:46.940 --> 03:01:49.420
... it's hard for him
to keep track of them all.

03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:52.560
Well, you'd remember this,
if the story's true.

03:01:52.710 --> 03:01:54.850
My uncle's name was Tommy O'Rourke.

03:01:55.120 --> 03:01:58.190
They called him Tommy Behind-the-Deuce.

03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:06.130
I thought so.
Guess my father's story's true.

03:02:06.290 --> 03:02:09.870
He said my uncle killed a mining man
named Schneider in a card game.

03:02:10.030 --> 03:02:14.540
This Schneider fellow was very popular,
and pretty soon a lynch mob had formed.

03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:19.040
They were coming down to jail
to take Tommy out and string him up.

03:02:24.210 --> 03:02:25.750
Marshal!

03:02:25.910 --> 03:02:28.260
Marshal Earp, give me a gun!

03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:31.690
For God's sake, let me protect myself!

03:02:33.450 --> 03:02:37.490
Tommy, if I hear one more sound
out of you, I’m gonna help them do it.

03:02:37.930 --> 03:02:42.170
It seems your brothers were off collecting
renegade Indians in another town.

03:02:42.330 --> 03:02:43.930
You were all alone.

03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:48.200
They were shouting that they ought to
just shoot you, take Tommy with them.

03:02:48.370 --> 03:02:51.280
Finally, when they quieted down,
you said:

03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:53.210
Nice mob you got here.

03:02:53.370 --> 03:02:57.010
-I said, we want Tommy O'Rourke!
-Yeah!

03:02:57.740 --> 03:03:01.090
Get set for disappointment,
because you're not gonna get him.

03:03:01.250 --> 03:03:03.820
-He killed one of my men.
-He killed a man!

03:03:03.980 --> 03:03:06.050
He'll stand trial for that.

03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:10.030
You arrogant son of a bitch.
You think you can stop all of us?

03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:19.910
You boys can get me.

03:03:20.430 --> 03:03:24.070
That won't be any problem
with all the guns you got here.

03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:27.920
But I’m taking 1 0 or 1 2 of you with me.

03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:29.680
Starting with you, Dick Gird.

03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:32.420
And you, McGee.

03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:35.720
Maybe you too, Harvey.

03:03:38.190 --> 03:03:41.190
So if any of you want Tommy...

03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:43.360
... and you want me...

03:03:44.590 --> 03:03:47.440
... come up front with these brave men.

03:03:47.590 --> 03:03:49.940
We'll all go together.

03:04:25.270 --> 03:04:27.510
Anyway, that's what my father told us.

03:04:29.700 --> 03:04:31.740
What happened to your Uncle Tommy?

03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:35.610
He was shot dead up at Omaha in '87.

03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:40.560
Guess he wasn't worth saving.

03:04:42.220 --> 03:04:44.750
Anyway, it's an honor...

03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:47.230
... Mr. Earp, sir.

03:04:47.620 --> 03:04:49.330
Ma'am.

03:05:02.470 --> 03:05:05.470
Some people say
it didn't happen that way.

03:05:06.910 --> 03:05:09.150
Never mind them, Wyatt.

03:05:09.310 --> 03:05:11.810
It happened that way.
