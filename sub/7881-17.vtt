00:34.125 --> 00:35.417
Oh, Stan...

00:35.417 --> 00:37.959
I love having date night
on a Tuesday.

00:37.959 --> 00:39.458
And it's Taco Tuesday,

00:39.458 --> 00:41.458
where all the tacos
are two for one.

00:42.583 --> 00:45.000
Your frugality
is so sexy.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.542
I brought a garbage bag

00:46.542 --> 00:48.125
that we can fill with chips.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.709
You know, maybe with
all the money we're saving

00:50.709 --> 00:51.875
on Mexican food,

00:51.875 --> 00:54.041
we can finally
buy a new couch.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.625
Too many animals have
given birth on the old one.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.333
Stan...?

00:58.333 --> 00:59.583
Are you listening?

01:01.500 --> 01:02.667
Yeah, uh...

01:02.667 --> 01:04.834
I was, I was just
looking at, uh...

01:04.834 --> 01:06.333
the-the alcohol.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.709
H-H-Have they always
served hard alcohol here?

01:08.709 --> 01:11.875
Stan, you have two Jack
and Cokes in front of you.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.583
You get them every time
we come here.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.000
Jack is alcohol?!

01:16.000 --> 01:17.792
Why, I always
thought it was slang.

01:17.792 --> 01:21.000
Like, "That soda be so cheap
you Jack and Coke, son."

01:27.041 --> 01:28.875
You just couldn't
keep your eyes off

01:28.875 --> 01:30.583
that slutty bartender,
could you?

01:30.583 --> 01:31.917
Wait, what?!

01:31.917 --> 01:33.333
Are you just guessing
that she's slutty,

01:33.333 --> 01:34.458
or have you
heard something?

01:38.333 --> 01:39.667
Well, we're in the driveway

01:39.667 --> 01:41.500
and that's where all
conversations end.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.166
I'm gonna go deal with
the B-side of Taco Tuesday.

01:44.166 --> 01:45.375
See you at sex later?

01:49.333 --> 01:50.792
Wednesday morning,

01:50.792 --> 01:52.667
that means Stan's
fresh off date night.

01:52.667 --> 01:53.917
Come on, spill it!

01:53.917 --> 01:55.125
All right. Highlight:

01:55.125 --> 01:57.542
Successfully passed
an expired coupon.

01:57.542 --> 01:58.750
Nice!
The master!

01:58.750 --> 02:00.500
Keeping it cheap!

02:00.500 --> 02:02.625
Lowlight: Francine
almost busted me

02:02.625 --> 02:04.333
checking out this
hot girl's boobs.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.417
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
You can't get caught looking.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.125
Yeah, man.
Women talk.

02:08.125 --> 02:10.417
If my girlfriend hears
you're checking out other women,

02:10.417 --> 02:12.333
she'll realize
I do it too.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.709
Guys, guys, relax.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.291
I covered it with an excuse

02:15.291 --> 02:17.125
and even agreed to go
couch shopping at the mall.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.417
The mall?!

02:18.417 --> 02:20.250
That place is crawling
with hot chicks.

02:20.250 --> 02:23.041
So, I'll just play it safe
and not look at any women.

02:23.041 --> 02:24.583
No, you can still look.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.417
You just gotta
learn to rubberneck.

02:26.417 --> 02:27.959
"Rubberneck?"
What's that?

02:27.959 --> 02:30.875
We'll tell you, but you
gotta keep it a secret.

02:30.875 --> 02:33.875
Women can never find out
about rubbernecking.

02:33.875 --> 02:36.166
New black intern:
Kick it.

02:40.333 --> 02:43.917
Rubbernecking is the art of
checking out women on the sly.

02:43.917 --> 02:45.542
And if you do it right,

02:45.542 --> 02:47.500
you'll never get caught.

This better be important.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.208
I'm crank calling my aunt
in Düsseldorf.

04:20.208 --> 04:21.542
She's on.

04:21.542 --> 04:23.542
I'm going to kill you.

04:24.417 --> 04:25.542
Okay, what now?

04:26.875 --> 04:28.583
A new couch!

04:28.583 --> 04:30.583
It feels like I'm floating.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.583
Well, I took a long enough
lunch; better go back to work.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.000
Listen, Stan...

04:35.000 --> 04:37.709
I'm sorry I got
so paranoid last night.

04:37.709 --> 04:40.417
There were beautiful women
all over the mall today

04:40.417 --> 04:41.792
and you didn't even notice.

04:41.792 --> 04:43.458
You're talking about
that redhead, right?

04:43.458 --> 04:47.000
Either way, you should know
I only have eyes for you.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.667
You know, Klaus,

04:51.667 --> 04:54.041
I've been saving something
for an occasion just like this.

04:54.041 --> 04:57.250
This bottle of wine was
a gift from Julia Child...

04:57.250 --> 04:58.667
to Liz Taylor.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.542
I stole it when I worked
at the post office.

05:01.959 --> 05:05.458
Yes, red wine, the deepest
staining of all the wines.

05:05.458 --> 05:06.959
To our new couch.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.125
Ah, that was
a terrible toast.

05:11.125 --> 05:12.291
Could've been
about any couch.

05:12.291 --> 05:13.417
Let's try again.

05:13.417 --> 05:16.041
To our new, pristine,
white couch.

05:20.208 --> 05:22.208
Blech! Ooh! It's turned.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.834
That is bad wine.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.375
That is real bad wine.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.041
Never keep wine
in the car.

05:27.041 --> 05:28.959
I knew it and
I did it anyway.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.417
Oh, no, the couch.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.792
The cushions are sewn in.

05:33.792 --> 05:34.875
We can't flip them.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.834
Stan will kill us!

05:36.834 --> 05:38.709
What are we gonna do?!

05:38.709 --> 05:40.667
We'll just have to
sit here forever.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.625
That's brilliant!

05:42.625 --> 05:46.375
Oh, isn't it crazy how worried
we were a moment ago?

05:53.500 --> 05:55.875
Well, hello, hot jogger.

05:55.875 --> 05:57.792
♪ Rubbernecking... ♪

05:57.792 --> 05:59.959
Might as well get some
photo proof for the boys

05:59.959 --> 06:01.083
while I'm here.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.333
Not doing anything wrong.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.792
Just looking for a signal.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.417
Definitely not
zooming in to see

06:05.417 --> 06:07.041
if you're wearing underpants.

06:10.625 --> 06:13.250
Some from the back
and don't forget the rack.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.709
Damn it, if Francine
finds out I crashed

06:23.709 --> 06:25.458
because I was rubbernecking,
I'm a dead man.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.834
Ah...! My back hurts

06:27.834 --> 06:29.333
and I used to have a great back!

06:29.333 --> 06:30.709
What the hell
were you looking at?

06:32.458 --> 06:35.041
Uh, uh, nothing.
I must've lingered on a blink.

06:35.041 --> 06:37.208
Are you okay?

06:37.208 --> 06:38.417
Do you need help?

06:38.417 --> 06:40.375
Get out of here!
You've done enough!

06:47.291 --> 06:48.917
Nice.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.959
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?!

07:01.959 --> 07:04.750
Oh, I got in a car accident,
Francine, but don't worry,

07:04.750 --> 07:06.333
luckily I've had
enough time to remember

07:06.333 --> 07:07.917
the exact truth
of what happened.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.500
Oh, you poor thing.
Come rest your bloody head

07:10.500 --> 07:12.041
right here underneath
where I'm sitting.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.250
You see, I was
driving responsibly

07:14.250 --> 07:17.417
with my eyes on the road,
when a dog jumped out.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.291
I saved his life by swerving.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.125
He made eye contact
as he ran away.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.750
No words exchanged,
he wasn't a talking dog,

07:23.750 --> 07:27.000
but in that moment,
I knew he thought me a hero.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.750
Well, come on.
With a head trauma like this,

07:29.750 --> 07:31.417
you should get right into bed.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.625
It's like they say,

07:32.625 --> 07:35.709
"Starve a fever,
sleep a concussion."

07:40.166 --> 07:41.375
How'd you sleep?

07:41.375 --> 07:43.041
Ugh, lousy.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.417
Do I have tank head?

07:44.417 --> 07:46.291
Did you guys spend
the night on the couch?

07:46.291 --> 07:47.417
Uh... yes.

07:47.417 --> 07:48.959
We are, um...

07:48.959 --> 07:52.041
trying to set the world record
for longest continuous

07:52.041 --> 07:54.250
couch-sitting
in Smith household history.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.333
Good one, Klaus.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.667
Mr. Smith,
my name is Heinrich Brown.

07:59.667 --> 08:00.750
Okay!

08:00.750 --> 08:02.458
I'm from your
insurance company

08:02.458 --> 08:04.333
and I'm here to review
the details of your accident.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.166
Anyway, I was hoping
to talk to you

08:08.166 --> 08:10.875
about exactly how
your accident went down.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.250
Of course!
Of cour-- of course.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.333
Come in. Come in.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.458
Hope you like nothin',

08:14.458 --> 08:16.125
'cause that's what
I got to hide.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.875
Hey, do you mind
if we meet in the kitchen?

08:17.875 --> 08:20.500
My-my fish,
and this, uh...

08:20.500 --> 08:23.709
little girl are trying to set
a couch-sitting record.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.250
You don't remember me?

08:25.250 --> 08:26.959
I'm Jean-Louise Finch.

08:26.959 --> 08:30.291
You brought us some molasses
one foggy morning, remember?

08:31.875 --> 08:35.000
So... yeah, let's-let's
go to the kitchen.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.834
Thank you once more
for this delicious...

08:39.834 --> 08:41.583
glass of milk.

08:41.583 --> 08:44.333
Now, Mr. Smith, before I start,
I want to remind you

08:44.333 --> 08:46.583
that insurance fraud
is a felony,

08:46.583 --> 08:48.709
punishable by serious jail time.

08:49.959 --> 08:52.000
Your sworn statement
says you swerved

08:52.000 --> 08:54.166
because a dog jumped
in front of your car?

08:54.166 --> 08:56.083
Are you sure that's
what caused the accident?

08:56.083 --> 08:57.750
Why wouldn't he be sure?

08:57.750 --> 08:59.250
I don't know, Mrs. Smith.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.083
It's not my job to know
what caused the accident.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.250
It's my job to find out.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.709
And then, after that... to know.

09:11.458 --> 09:15.208
He keeps drinking, but there's
always the same amount of milk!

09:19.291 --> 09:21.625
Thank you again,
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

09:21.625 --> 09:24.792
I will return this glass
when I am done with my milk.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.000
Oh, don't return it,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.750
just put it down
when you're done.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.542
If I was meant to have it,
it'll find its way back to me.

09:29.542 --> 09:33.917
And Mr. Smith, please know that
if you are hiding anything,

09:33.917 --> 09:36.875
anything at all,
I will sniff it out.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.875
It's an ability of mine.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.125
For instance...

09:41.125 --> 09:43.583
your fish and that
Southern tomboy

09:43.583 --> 09:46.542

it's a separate vehicle

11:08.792 --> 11:10.709
and it's not covered.

11:10.709 --> 11:12.000
Heinrich!

11:12.000 --> 11:13.625
Wh-What, wh-what
are you doing here?

11:13.625 --> 11:15.458
Ah, Mr. Smith.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.083
I was about to close your case,

11:17.083 --> 11:21.500
but one small, easily-answered
question arose.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.917
It-it... it did?

11:22.917 --> 11:25.875
Yes, you said a dog ran in front
of your car.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.750
But in this
traffic camera photo,

11:27.750 --> 11:29.375
the only thing I see

11:29.375 --> 11:31.041
is a fox.

11:32.709 --> 11:34.667
She's quite beautiful.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.875
Did she happen
to catch your eye?

11:36.875 --> 11:38.542
Oh, I don't... I don't pay
attention to joggers

11:38.542 --> 11:41.333
when I'm driving. No, th-they're
like pedestrians to me.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.083
I'm just gonna come out
and say it:

11:43.083 --> 11:44.542
I think you were rubbernecking.

11:44.542 --> 11:45.875
With the best.

11:45.875 --> 11:48.125
But I unfortunately
have no evidence.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.250
So I'm gonna have
to close your case.

11:52.959 --> 11:55.500
As long as I don't find anything
at the routine inspection

11:55.500 --> 11:58.125
of your vehicle
at the body shop.

12:02.083 --> 12:04.083
Well, looks like
we're in the clear.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.166
He's not gonna find anything.
The only evidence

12:06.166 --> 12:08.041
is some pictures of that jogger
in my phone.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.959
Which I haven't even looked at
since the accident

12:09.959 --> 12:12.125
because my phone's in my car.

12:12.125 --> 12:15.000
You brought him in
here, you bastard!

12:15.000 --> 12:18.750
Rubbernecking is all I have!

12:21.166 --> 12:24.542
Get down there
and clean up your mess!

12:27.041 --> 12:30.208
'Twas beauty killed the beast.

12:31.625 --> 12:35.083
Mr. Smith, how odd
to see you here.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.125
Uh, have you
inspected the car?

12:37.125 --> 12:39.125
Everywhere but under
the driver's seat.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.208
I always save that...
for dessert.

12:51.792 --> 12:54.083
Nothing.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.208
Mr. Smith,
I'm a proud man

12:56.208 --> 12:59.250
but not too proud
to admit when I'm beaten.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.792
I'm very proud of that.

13:01.792 --> 13:04.083
Good-bye forever,
Mr. Smith.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.208
My glass!

13:14.083 --> 13:17.000
Aw...

13:17.000 --> 13:19.625
Stan? I lied, Stan.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.625
Klaus didn't spill
the wine-- we both did.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.875
I had to tell you
'cause it's the truth.

13:24.875 --> 13:28.750
And if we ain't got no truth
in this world, what do we have?

13:28.750 --> 13:30.375
Damn lies.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.625
You're not Stan.
How'd you get Stan's phone?

13:32.625 --> 13:34.083
What else of Stan's
do you have?

13:34.083 --> 13:35.709
Let's sell it all
and split the dough.

13:35.709 --> 13:38.625
We're in this together.
Don't you dare double-cross me!

13:40.458 --> 13:44.375
Just as I suspected.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.709
Your crash was caused
by rubbernecking.

13:46.709 --> 13:50.667
Mr. Smith, you're under arrest
for insurance fraud.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.625
Oh, my God, what happened?

13:55.625 --> 13:57.041
I was checking out

13:57.041 --> 13:59.667
a hot chick in
a news copter.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.500
See? He told the truth.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.417
And everyone's
the better for it.

14:04.417 --> 14:06.417
I'd like to purchase...

14:06.417 --> 14:08.750
some life insurance.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.375
Are you a smoker?

14:10.375 --> 14:12.375
Only when I drink.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.750
Steve, why isn't
your mother here?

14:22.750 --> 14:24.083
She's hurt, Dad.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.959
She's so upset
about your rubbernecking

14:25.959 --> 14:28.125
she's not even coming
to your trial.

14:28.125 --> 14:31.125
And I got to say,
I don't blame her.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.041
All right.

16:25.041 --> 16:28.625
Mr. Smith, you will be judged
by a jury of your peers,

16:28.625 --> 16:30.542
who just happen to all be

16:30.542 --> 16:32.542
married women
around your wife's age.

16:34.333 --> 16:38.041
Mr. Smith, this is a photo not
of the dog you claimed to avoid

16:38.041 --> 16:40.041
but of an admittedly
attractive jogger

16:40.041 --> 16:42.542
that you took at the time
of your accident.

16:42.542 --> 16:45.458
And here is a photo
of your wife.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.834
With a wife this attractive,

16:46.834 --> 16:48.917
why were you looking
at another woman?

16:48.917 --> 16:51.458
Are you some kind of deviant?

16:51.458 --> 16:52.834
What? No.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.583
Looking at other women
is normal. It's...

16:56.458 --> 16:57.583
Mr. Smith?

16:57.583 --> 16:58.792
You were saying?

16:58.792 --> 17:00.542
No, I-I-I don't,
I don't think I was.

17:00.542 --> 17:03.333
Come on, Mr. Smith.
Admit it.

17:03.333 --> 17:08.041
You're a sex-crazed maniac,
no better than a U.S. senator.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.417
How dare you!

17:09.417 --> 17:11.667
I am a lot of things,
but not a senator!

17:11.667 --> 17:14.500
Then why were you taking
these photos?!

17:14.500 --> 17:16.375
Because I was rubbernecking!

17:16.375 --> 17:17.542
All men do it!

17:19.709 --> 17:21.583
Uh... I don't.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.083

17:37.583 --> 17:40.542
and I'm supposed to make sure
you get a fair trial,

17:40.542 --> 17:43.583
but everyone in here
should be disgusted with you.

17:43.583 --> 17:46.792

I'd never take my eyes off her.

17:46.792 --> 17:48.625

the court for a quick recess?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.500

for my answer...

17:55.500 --> 17:57.208
Steve, take this
to your mother.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.792
She doesn't want
to hear it, Dad.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.917
She won't have to hear it.
She'll have to read it.

18:00.917 --> 18:03.625

But unfortunately, Mr. Smith,

20:48.709 --> 20:50.417
you're on trial
for insurance fraud,

20:50.417 --> 20:52.792
which you definitely did.

20:52.792 --> 20:55.792
I hereby sentence you
to six years in prison.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.625
Lucky!
