01:56.200 --> 01:59.287
This is a true story.

01:59.454 --> 02:05.543
It began in August 1980 at Mt Isa
in the Australian state of Queensland.

02:17.764 --> 02:21.517
Our pastor Michael and his wife
Lindy stand before you today

02:21.684 --> 02:24.520
with their two boys, Aidan and Reagan,

02:24.687 --> 02:28.024
with their new little daughter
and baby sister

02:28.191 --> 02:34.030
Azaria Chantel Loren Chamberlain,

02:34.238 --> 02:39.243
who you have lent us, Lord, and we're
here to dedicate her life back to you.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.121
We would ask the family
and friends and congregation

02:42.330 --> 02:46.918
to stand and promise to set a proper
example for this child as she grows up.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.469
All clear to the church, mate.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.431
Jesus! Have a look
at those fucking Adventists!

03:00.640 --> 03:02.058
Talk about up yourself.

03:02.225 --> 03:05.728
Money, mate. More than you
can poke a fuckin' stick at!

03:20.493 --> 03:25.832
I think this'll fit you in about
two months' time. Yes, it will.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.668
- Hello?
- In here, Jenny.

03:30.795 --> 03:33.506
- I've finished it.
- Oh, it's pretty.

03:33.673 --> 03:35.842
- Thank you.
- Thought I'd help you pack.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.928
Oh. Well, I'm pretty much ready.

03:39.095 --> 03:41.931
Black? Oh, yuck!

03:42.098 --> 03:45.309
- That was my baby dress.
- Was it, darling?

03:45.476 --> 03:48.104
Yes. I like black.

03:48.855 --> 03:52.692
You may not believe
that your body is a temple of God.

03:52.900 --> 03:57.195
But tonight we face not
a belief, but a fact.

03:57.196 --> 04:01.450
The fact is that your body
is the only body that you will ever own.

04:01.659 --> 04:04.662
I want you to throw
away your cigarettes,

04:04.829 --> 04:07.623
your pipes, your tobacco, your cigars,

04:07.832 --> 04:10.251
before they throw you away.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.095
Hi, honey.

04:21.262 --> 04:24.390
- How are you?
- I got everything done.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.228
I recorded six weeks of programmes,
saw everyone I had to see.

04:29.395 --> 04:32.148
I finished my counselling. Just.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.234
Did you post my study leave application?

04:35.401 --> 04:37.778
- Yes, I did.
- Good.

04:42.116 --> 04:46.203
I think it's time
we started our holidays, don't you?

04:47.496 --> 04:49.832
This is where we are, here.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.251
Where do Gran and Grandad live?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.337
They live down here.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.964
This is where we lived
last year, near Cairns.

04:57.131 --> 05:01.302
Right up in the north is where you catch
the biggest barramundi in the world,

05:01.469 --> 05:03.470
which is where Daddy
wanted to go on

05:03.471 --> 05:05.765
holiday, but your
mother had other plans.

05:05.932 --> 05:08.142
What's a barramundi?

05:08.309 --> 05:10.353
A fish dinner for 12.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.563
Not the ones your father catches!

05:12.730 --> 05:16.734
Now, now! And this is where
we're going, down here.

05:16.943 --> 05:20.738
Devils Marbles, the
Olgas and Ayers Rock.

05:20.905 --> 05:24.200
- The biggest rock in the world.
- Wow!

05:44.553 --> 05:46.514
Come on, boys.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.558
Come on!

05:54.981 --> 05:57.108
Tell me what's in that cave up there.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.360
Be careful.

06:00.653 --> 06:03.197
Ooh! Look at that!

06:03.364 --> 06:05.241
Yeah, a dingo.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.535
Kids, come and have a look.

06:07.702 --> 06:09.912
Michael, look.

06:10.830 --> 06:13.290
So he climbed up on his camel.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.127
- Hello!
- Hello!

06:16.293 --> 06:19.964
We all went riding round the ring,
and my camel went...

06:20.131 --> 06:23.342
And his camel went...

06:30.433 --> 06:32.893
You wouldn't get me up there.

06:33.602 --> 06:37.231
- Have you been up?
- Are you mad?! Look at that bloke!

06:37.398 --> 06:40.442
He's keen! Do you
reckon he'll make it?

06:40.443 --> 06:42.986
Not if he drinks that six-pack.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.989
Oh, look at this idiot!

06:47.616 --> 06:49.535
Talk about stupid!

06:49.702 --> 06:52.204
What a nut!

06:52.371 --> 06:54.165
That's my husband.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.712
He wouldn't be doing that
unless it was safe.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.341
Over here, hubby. That's beautiful.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.094
Smile, darling. Smile for Daddy.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.056
That's it. Good girl. Good girl!

07:11.640 --> 07:14.435
Just wind it on, darling.

07:14.602 --> 07:18.230
- I'll race you to the top.
- Smile for Mummy.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.024
Come on, darling.

07:20.191 --> 07:22.193
Michael, the boys.

07:22.902 --> 07:24.361
Boys!

07:32.578 --> 07:36.082
Get that little body in there.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.417
Bit better. That's it.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.753
Oh, you like your bath!

07:41.796 --> 07:44.256
Can you see Daddy?
Where is he, sweetheart?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.892
Hello, sweetie. Where's your Daddy?

07:57.144 --> 08:02.274
- Are you right there, darling?
- Well, don't wanna miss the sunset.

08:04.068 --> 08:07.404
You might wanna see
if the boys are in their pyjamas.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.616
You might even try to
get them in the car.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.913
Boys!

08:25.214 --> 08:27.091
Brrrrrm!

08:27.383 --> 08:29.300
Brrrrrm!

08:29.301 --> 08:31.303
Honk! Honk!

08:40.354 --> 08:43.149
Is it an automatic camera?

08:43.357 --> 08:45.568
No. Well, it's semiautomatic...

08:50.281 --> 08:53.033
I'll get it in a second.

08:53.242 --> 08:57.079
- A teacher. You gotta be a teacher!
- Oh, come on!

08:57.246 --> 08:59.331
Look, I'll give you three more guesses.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.459
If you don't get it by then,
maybe I'll tell you tomorrow.

09:02.626 --> 09:06.338
A bank clerk! I'll be buggered
if you're not a bank clerk.

09:06.505 --> 09:09.717
Reagan went right out.
I can't get bubby to settle, though.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.511
I don't know your names,
but this is my wife Lindy.

09:12.678 --> 09:16.223
- Hi. Is he playing games with you?
- And I'm Michael.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.977
- He's a terror when he's on holiday.
- He can't be as bad as this one.

09:20.144 --> 09:22.730
- Hi, I'm Sully Lawn.
- Grog.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.109
Hey, there's a dingo. Here, fella!

09:27.276 --> 09:30.905
Don't encourage him, Michael.
The signs say you shouldn't.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.448
I saw you today, going
up the Rock with a

09:33.449 --> 09:35.659
baby in a backpack.
Carrying a six-pack.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.871
- I thought you were cracked.
- It's thirsty work climbing.

09:39.038 --> 09:40.623
- Can I have a look-see?
- Yeah.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.042
Greg, the worst thing
for a thirst is alcohol.

09:43.209 --> 09:45.711
You're joking!
The worst thing for a thirst is sand.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.172
Hello! Hello!

09:48.797 --> 09:50.715
Can't keep its blankets on it.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.260
She's so tiny! I
thought she was bigger.

09:54.136 --> 09:56.680
- What's your name?
- That's Chantel.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.932
No!

09:58.933 --> 10:00.517
Chantel, Michael.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.895
- That's this one's second name!
- Yeah?

10:03.062 --> 10:05.231
Yeah.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.608
You don't happen to know what it means?

10:07.816 --> 10:10.903
It's French for Gypsy
lead singer, I think.

10:18.494 --> 10:21.080
I belt into town ten times
a day if I have to.

10:21.247 --> 10:26.126
- I'm not gonna believe you're a farmer.
- It was a beautiful bike.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.796
- What are you looking for, Aidan?
- A mouse.

10:28.963 --> 10:33.133
The hardest thing I ever did
in my life was to sell it.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.302
It's down here, sweetheart.

10:40.391 --> 10:42.768
The cheeky buggers.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.854
I had one follow me
back from the rubbish bin before.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.731
These are ready, honey.

10:47.940 --> 10:51.735
I think this little one's
finally conked out.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.280
I'm gonna go and put her down.
Bedtime!

10:54.446 --> 10:57.074
Be right back.

10:57.241 --> 11:02.538
- Wanna try one of these, Greg?
- Mm, yeah. I've got some room left.

11:05.124 --> 11:06.500
Yeah.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.502
Shit!

11:08.711 --> 11:11.338
What kind of bloody sausage is that?

11:11.505 --> 11:14.133
- Vegetarian.
- Christ!

11:14.300 --> 11:18.053
Now I know what you are.
You're Bugs bloody Bunny, aren't you?

11:18.220 --> 11:20.848
Jesus, feed the man meat, mate!

11:27.438 --> 11:28.772
Oh, ace!

11:28.939 --> 11:30.941
Dad, Dad! Give it this.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.361
This is tops.

11:40.451 --> 11:46.415
But if I had the dough, I'd buy
a BMW RT 1000. There's a beautiful bike.

11:46.623 --> 11:50.085
It'll do in excess of 255mph.

11:50.252 --> 11:52.920
- Bullshit!
- Yeah.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.007
In free fall.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.176
Get out!

12:08.228 --> 12:10.272
Crikey! How's your kidneys?

12:10.439 --> 12:14.276
Fair go. I haven't even started yet!
Never trust a man who doesn't drink.

12:14.485 --> 12:16.653
Can I tempt you, Michael?

12:16.820 --> 12:20.407
Have you any idea what that stuff
has done to your brain, Greg?

12:20.574 --> 12:23.160
- Did she settle?
- That's Azaria crying, honey.

12:23.327 --> 12:27.414
- That's bubby, Mummy.
- Are you sure? She was fast asleep.

12:30.334 --> 12:35.672
Are you trying to tell me there's
something wrong with drinking beer?

12:39.593 --> 12:42.638
Go on! Get out!
There's a dingo in the tent.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.893
Dingo's got the baby!

12:51.939 --> 12:53.982
God. No, please, God.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.694
The dingo's got my baby!

12:57.861 --> 12:59.613
What?

13:04.410 --> 13:06.412
We're coming!

13:11.834 --> 13:14.044
I can't see.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.256
- Aidan, wait here.
- I can't see.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.928
Michael!

13:23.137 --> 13:25.639
You can't see. It's too dark.
You need a torch.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.183
Michael, that way! You can't see!

13:28.976 --> 13:32.312
You need a torch!
Has anybody got a torch?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.648
The dingo's got my baby!

13:35.107 --> 13:37.359
What's going on?

13:38.777 --> 13:40.904
Please help me!

13:49.204 --> 13:51.206
Get the police.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.627
Have you got a torch?
The dingo's taken my baby.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.505
All right. It's better if I go.

14:00.549 --> 14:01.340
Are you right?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.594
Get the police. I
can't get this started.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.512
Don't you worry about it.

14:05.679 --> 14:09.391
- Where's the baby?
- The dingo's taken the baby. Up there!

14:09.558 --> 14:12.311
- Has the dingo got your baby?
- Yes.

14:14.313 --> 14:17.900
The dingo can't have our bubby
in its tummy, Mummy.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.531
Jesus'll look after her.
You stay by the tent.

14:24.698 --> 14:28.577
I have to keep looking and you have to
be there in case your brother wakes up.

14:28.744 --> 14:32.498
I've gotta keep looking, darling.
You stay here.

14:40.631 --> 14:43.133
- I need a torch!
- Here, take mine.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.306
- It's no good. There's no beam.
- Here, Daddy.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.153
What are you doin', mate?
What are you? Lost?

15:03.362 --> 15:06.740
- I've lost my baby.
- Had a bit to drink, mate!

15:08.325 --> 15:11.453
Come on, boy. Come on.
There's a good... Come on.

15:12.538 --> 15:16.542
Come on. You can show me
where your sleeping bag is, darling.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.211
- Reagan's dead.
- No, he's all right.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.673
He's dead. He's dead. He's dead.

15:23.966 --> 15:27.928
No, look, see?
He's just tuckered out. He's fine.

15:28.095 --> 15:33.016
I'll just be sitting outside on this
rail here, all right? Just outside, OK?

15:33.392 --> 15:36.436
Careful not to step on
any tracks, you blokes.

15:39.731 --> 15:43.902
Whatever we find, there's no joy
for you. You know that, don't you?

15:45.279 --> 15:47.906
I've seen what dogs do to lambs, mate.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.172
That one there!

16:04.339 --> 16:06.466
You're the parents?
How big was the child?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.885
Nine weeks. Nine to ten pounds.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.680
- Did you double-check inside the tent?
- Of course.

16:11.847 --> 16:15.601
- What was it wearing?
- White jump suit. Everything white.

16:15.767 --> 16:19.855
- It was wearing white.
- White jump suit. White matinee jacket.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.524
Stay close to the camp
in case I need you, please.

16:22.691 --> 16:24.318
Constable!

16:24.484 --> 16:28.363
We want our daughter returned to us,
no matter what. We want her back.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.575
Has anyone seen the head ranger?

16:43.879 --> 16:46.548
Jesus Christ.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.426
Torches on!

16:49.635 --> 16:52.012
Group C, move down that way.

16:52.179 --> 16:56.183
Group A, down that way.
The rest of you follow me.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.605
Spread out, please.
Keep a straight line, arm's length.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.569
The Bible says at the Second Coming,

17:08.569 --> 17:12.074
babies will be restored
to their mothers' arms.

17:12.240 --> 17:17.371
Mrs Chamberlain? I'm Bobby Downs.
I'm the district nurse here.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.957
- How long's the baby...
- A little over an hour.

17:41.603 --> 17:45.023
No, no, no. I'm gonna throw up.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.321
Why aren't they searching just there?

17:51.488 --> 17:53.782
It might have dropped it this close.

17:53.949 --> 17:56.284
I... I couldn't bear that.

17:56.451 --> 18:00.706
If she died because
we didn't look in the right place.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.470
There.

18:18.181 --> 18:22.269
The baby's finished. Finished, you know?

18:39.828 --> 18:42.414
They've been out there for ages.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.957
We should get you to a motel.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.170
No, we have to stay here for the police.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.423
Besides, we don't have the money.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.675
Oh, look!

19:04.269 --> 19:05.562
Uh...

19:05.729 --> 19:07.689
People!

19:07.856 --> 19:09.399
Folks!

19:09.566 --> 19:11.860
It's my daughter you're looking for.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.946
And, uh...

19:15.155 --> 19:18.408
I want to thank you all
for what you're doing.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.164
- I'm a minister of religion.
- A bloody parson! Jesus.

19:24.372 --> 19:29.961
I know that nothing happens
in the world unless God allows it.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.090
And...

19:34.257 --> 19:37.969
I know that there's
little hope any longer of...

19:39.679 --> 19:42.182
finding our little daughter alive.

19:43.099 --> 19:47.103
But I am thankful that...

19:48.230 --> 19:50.273
we will see her again at the R...

19:50.440 --> 19:52.442
at the Resurrection.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.280
Let us pray.

19:57.447 --> 20:01.993
Lord be with these willing
and kindly people

20:02.160 --> 20:05.622
as they help look for
our little one tonight.

20:05.789 --> 20:08.250
Help them look...

20:15.715 --> 20:18.760
Mummy! Do I have to stay in here?

20:18.927 --> 20:21.096
It's all right now, Aidan.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.852
It's like a morgue in that tent.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.849
There's room for that over here.

21:06.057 --> 21:10.061
Oh, that'll be all right.
I always keep it down there.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.441
Is this an expensive motel?

21:14.608 --> 21:17.735
You don't have to worry.
I've spoken to them.

21:17.736 --> 21:21.656
You can stay as long as you need.
There'll be no charge.

21:31.958 --> 21:35.545
G'day. I've put you in room 34
at the end of the path.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.759
There's your key.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.681
We prayed for a daughter.
He gave us a daughter.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.892
Why would he take her away?

21:49.100 --> 21:52.312
They should have warned us.
The signs never said.

21:52.479 --> 21:57.609
I'd have slept them all in the car
if only I'd known. If only we'd known.

21:57.776 --> 22:00.820
There has to be a reason.
There's got to be a reason.

22:01.029 --> 22:05.116
We slept her in the tent.
I zipped it up when I put Reagan down.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.327
I should have zipped
it up when I put her

22:08.328 --> 22:10.997
in, even if it was
only for a minute.

22:12.958 --> 22:15.961
What are we gonna tell
our parents, Michael?

22:17.087 --> 22:19.506
They never even saw Azaria.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.261
I'm freezing.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.974
You can't be freezing.
The heater's on.

22:31.643 --> 22:34.062
- What are you doing?
- Getting my sleeping bag.

22:34.229 --> 22:37.189
You can't do that.
It's got blood on it.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.900
Yours has. Mine hasn't.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.820
I'm sorry, but I'm freezing.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.781
Heating or not.

22:47.909 --> 22:50.120
I'm so cold.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.082
She was so little.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.846
Mummy!

23:09.431 --> 23:10.640
Mummy!

23:10.807 --> 23:14.936
I'm just praying that Jesus
will keep the dingo's mouth shut,

23:15.103 --> 23:20.734
like he did for Daniel in the lions'
den, and he won't let him eat our bubby.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.612
Oh, darling. She's so little.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.490
Jesus wouldn't let her have any pain.

23:28.241 --> 23:31.201
But our bubby had a
little cold, you know.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.455
It's so freezing out there.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.500
Daddy and I believe
that bubby's dead, sweetheart.

23:38.918 --> 23:42.589
And Jesus is going to
look after her now, wherever she is.

23:42.756 --> 23:45.967
Till he comes to take us all
home to heaven.

23:46.134 --> 23:49.971
And she'll be better
because Jesus will make her better.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.599
She won't have the hiccups any more.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.809
No, that's right.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.563
You try to sleep now.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.081
My God!

24:27.926 --> 24:30.386
Michael, the police are here.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.143
Sorry, Mrs Chamberlain.
No news yet, I'm afraid.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.728
Will you be in later
for me to bring round

24:39.729 --> 24:41.898
a notification of death
for the coroner?

24:42.107 --> 24:45.902
Oh, yes. Yes.
Or in the office phoning our parents.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.529
Thank you.

24:47.695 --> 24:51.282
Michael, you'd better
ring your president too.

24:51.449 --> 24:54.327
Mummy, where's bubby?

25:07.048 --> 25:09.342
Just put in the name of the child.

25:10.218 --> 25:14.681
Hi, Mrs Chamberlain. Thought you might
like some help with the boys.

25:14.848 --> 25:16.182
Oh, thanks.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.893
I got some Lasix from the clinic.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.521
- Beg your pardon?
- Tablets. Help dry up your milk.

25:21.688 --> 25:22.939
Oh, yes.

25:23.106 --> 25:27.443
And, um... you'll be needing
this breast pump most likely.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.488
Mr Chamberlain.

25:31.156 --> 25:34.075
There are press calling.
I had the ABC radio on the line.

25:34.242 --> 25:36.703
They insist on talking to you.

25:38.496 --> 25:42.959
I don't know. What would you advise?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.919
We were just about to eat.

25:45.920 --> 25:49.591
We heard a cry out.
My wife hurried back to the tent.

25:49.799 --> 25:53.553
She saw a big yellow dog
coming out of the tent. Over.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.890
It was a dingo, Michael.
Not a big yellow dog. A dingo.

25:57.098 --> 26:00.143
Azaria Chantel Loren. Over.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.980
- What difference does it make?
- It's not right.

26:04.147 --> 26:08.902
It had probably stalked the baby
as we'd been there the second night.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.235
Listen to this.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.614
To many
this is called Ayers Rock,

26:12.780 --> 26:16.034
but to us it will always
be Azaria's Rock.

26:18.912 --> 26:22.498
- Is that you, Mr Chamberlain? Over.
- Speaking. Over.

26:22.665 --> 26:25.417
I was wondering whether
you could take a

26:25.418 --> 26:28.087
few photographs to
run with this story.

26:28.254 --> 26:32.300
We can't get up there to cover this,
unfortunately. There's just no way.

26:32.508 --> 26:35.887
You do want people to be warned
about the dangers up there? Over.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.768
He wants me to take some photographs
for his newspaper.

26:41.935 --> 26:44.771
You don't have to if you don't want to.

26:45.855 --> 26:50.652
She'll never have a grave.
Nothing to remember her by.

26:57.325 --> 27:01.788
Boys. Just stand in front of
the tent for me, will you?

27:05.959 --> 27:08.753
Keep going, if you would. Thank you.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.756
Mr Chamberlain, when you're ready.

27:11.923 --> 27:16.427
We were very shocked, of course, but at
that stage we still had some hope...

27:19.430 --> 27:21.557
Can we just do that again?

27:21.724 --> 27:26.187
That's OK. I've done some journalism
myself. I think I know what you mean.

27:26.354 --> 27:30.149
OK, right. Rolling. And... go.

27:31.192 --> 27:36.072
Well, it was shocking,
but we just held out some little hope.

27:36.239 --> 27:39.492
But when we saw
the spots of blood on the tent,

27:39.701 --> 27:43.579
we knew as we looked
that this was a very quick event.

27:44.622 --> 27:49.168
And this morning, when we saw
the sharp, ripped, jagged marks

27:49.377 --> 27:52.213
on that very thickly-woven blanket,

27:53.006 --> 27:56.801
that this was a powerful beast
with very sharp teeth.

27:57.051 --> 28:00.096
It was more than a domestic dog
that did this.

28:00.263 --> 28:02.682
OK, stop it there. It
gets boring after this.

28:02.849 --> 28:05.393
Now run this. I want to cut to her.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.768
That won't cut.

28:06.769 --> 28:10.189
Yes, it will if you
wait till after the pan,

28:10.356 --> 28:14.319
and put his last line over
to disguise the question.

28:14.485 --> 28:19.657
I want some good sci-fi music to go
over this to give it some atmosphere.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.451
News is art, huh?

28:21.617 --> 28:24.704
We knew that
this was a powerful beast

28:24.871 --> 28:26.747
with very sharp teeth.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.084
There's more to this
than meets the eye.

28:30.251 --> 28:33.004
- ...domestic dog that did this...
- Did you hear that?

28:33.171 --> 28:36.966
I just yelled.
There wasn't time to go and tell people.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.677
"Has anybody got a torch?
The dingo's got my baby."

28:39.844 --> 28:43.306
A dingo! They must think
we come down in the last shower!

28:43.473 --> 28:47.393
The parents, Michael and Lindy
Chamberlain, Seventh Day Adventists,

28:47.560 --> 28:51.356
say they've accepted the baby's death
as the will of God.

28:51.522 --> 28:54.984
They will leave Ayers Rock
tomorrow for their Mount Isa home.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.361
Christ.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.529
They could have picked somewhere else.

28:58.696 --> 29:01.407
They blame a dumb animal
who can't defend itself.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.076
I can't believe how
the dingo can have

29:04.077 --> 29:06.662
taken the baby and
it's never been found.

29:08.373 --> 29:12.210
Mrs Chamberlain?
Inspector Gilroy and Sergeant Lincoln.

29:12.377 --> 29:15.797
- I'm sorry, we have to interview you.
- Yes, all right. Come in.

29:16.464 --> 29:19.342
It might help me to talk about it.

29:19.509 --> 29:24.430
I believe you've already given Constable
Morris some items for identification?

29:24.597 --> 29:28.810
- What is it, darling?
- That's the dingo that took bubby.

29:30.895 --> 29:35.400
- Where did the dingo take bubby?
- The dingo took bubby shopping.

29:36.359 --> 29:38.444
He loves shopping.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.198
- It's never happened before.
- Kids have been bitten.

29:46.077 --> 29:48.913
Thinks he's bloody Lassie.

29:49.080 --> 29:52.208
That's ten pounds.
That's what the baby weighed.

29:52.375 --> 29:56.712
Have a go. A dingo couldn't get halfway
up the hill without taking a breather.

29:56.879 --> 30:00.883
- How long could you hold that for?
- That's right. Feel the weight of it.

30:21.112 --> 30:23.823
We've come to shoot the dogs, Nipper.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.201
I'm sorry.

30:29.078 --> 30:32.206
- OK?
- Let'em get used to the idea.

30:35.084 --> 30:38.129
Huh! Look who's here.

30:38.296 --> 30:39.881
Morning, Mrs Chamberlain.

30:40.548 --> 30:44.469
We don't wanna shoot any dogs
that we don't have to.

30:46.429 --> 30:49.682
No, they're all bitzers.
Nothing like it.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.692
I'm not taking another photograph.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.153
We found more blood on Aidan's parka.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.198
No, we have enough blood
with the blanket.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.576
Good. It's the only warm coat he has.

31:08.743 --> 31:11.329
Well, you have a list
of the places we'll be.

31:11.496 --> 31:15.583
Fine. You'll be advised
of the date of the coroner's inquest.

31:22.215 --> 31:25.593
- We should search that car.
- They've had it bad enough.

31:44.111 --> 31:47.240
After the mysterious disappearance
of their daughter,

31:47.406 --> 31:51.494
Mount Isa's Seventh Day Adventist pastor
Michael Chamberlain and his wife Lindy

31:51.661 --> 31:54.705
are expected to arrive home late today.

31:54.872 --> 31:58.834
The Chamberlains were on
a camping trip at Ayers Rock...

32:12.515 --> 32:14.517
Oh, Michael.

32:46.007 --> 32:52.054
"Consider yourselves fortunate
when all kinds of trials come your way,

32:52.221 --> 32:57.560
for you know that when your faith
succeeds in facing such trials,

32:57.727 --> 33:00.771
the result is the ability to endure."

33:02.189 --> 33:06.735
"Make sure that your endurance
carries you all the way without failing

33:06.736 --> 33:10.905
so that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking nothing."

33:10.906 --> 33:14.577
"But if any of you lacks wisdom,
he should pray to God,

33:14.744 --> 33:19.999
who will give it to him, because God
gives generously and graciously to all."

33:20.166 --> 33:22.126
"But when you pray..."

33:44.106 --> 33:46.108
Lindy, is this blood?

33:48.569 --> 33:50.237
Mm.

33:50.404 --> 33:54.575
Don't let Michael see it, it'll
upset him. Just put it over there.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.248
They're not locals.

34:07.129 --> 34:10.174
- Yes, can I help you?
- Mrs Chamberlain?

34:10.341 --> 34:12.592
I'm from the Women's Day. We rang you?

34:12.760 --> 34:14.969
Oh, yes.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.806
Can I just say how sorry I am?

34:17.973 --> 34:20.184
I'm a mother myself.

34:20.351 --> 34:23.396
Please accept the condolences
of everyone at the Women's Day.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.398
Thank you.

34:25.606 --> 34:30.110
Look, we'd like to tell Azaria's story,
Mrs Chamberlain.

34:30.277 --> 34:34.239
To make sure that this never
happens again, to warn everyone.

34:34.407 --> 34:37.324
We'd put her on the
front page and show

34:37.326 --> 34:40.286
the world what a
beautiful baby she was.

34:40.454 --> 34:42.581
May we come in?

35:08.816 --> 35:11.360
I'll take these back.
No sense in wasting money.

35:11.527 --> 35:14.572
No, I'll give it to Wendy for her bubby.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.284
Where's my hubby?

35:18.492 --> 35:21.245
Where's my bubby in the big, black dark?

35:21.412 --> 35:23.789
Where's my bubby? Where's my bubby?

35:23.956 --> 35:27.293
Where's my bubby in the big, black dark?

35:48.814 --> 35:51.275
Don't worry.
I'll put it back the way I found it.

35:51.442 --> 35:53.652
Bloodstained clothes
found at Ayers Rock

35:53.819 --> 35:56.363
are believed to be
those of Azaria Chamberlain,

35:56.572 --> 36:00.034
allegedly dragged from
her family tent by a dingo last week.

36:00.242 --> 36:04.330
A tourist found the white jump suit,
singlet, nappy and booties folded...

36:04.497 --> 36:07.958
Folded?
...in a cave, near a dingo lair.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.795
Where's her matinee jacket?

36:10.961 --> 36:13.422
Why weren't we told about this?

36:13.589 --> 36:16.425
However, the baby's father,
Mr Michael Chamberlain,

36:16.592 --> 36:19.887
seems convinced that his daughter
was taken by a dingo.

36:20.054 --> 36:24.558
When we saw the spots of blood in
the tent, we realised that this...

36:24.725 --> 36:26.727
Michael, did you talk to them?

36:26.894 --> 36:30.231
No, they used...
That's when we were at the Rock.

36:38.864 --> 36:42.243
I'm in charge of the
Chamberlain investigation now.

36:42.451 --> 36:44.870
Oh. Darwin. Politics?

36:45.037 --> 36:47.373
Been reading through your reports.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.751
This doctor's rumours from Mount Isa.
Did you check it out?

36:50.918 --> 36:54.171
Yes, I have. They seem groundless.

36:54.338 --> 36:58.133
What about this stuff about
"sacrifice in the wilderness", the name?

36:58.300 --> 37:01.344
- Azaria?
- It's a pretty weird name, isn't it?

37:01.345 --> 37:04.390
I heard it means
sacrifice in the bloody wilderness.

37:04.557 --> 37:07.893
What, do you reckon they took
the kid up there to sacrifice it?

37:08.060 --> 37:10.145
Yeah, they probably did.

37:10.354 --> 37:13.649
- The kid was always dressed in black.
- So was the mother.

37:13.816 --> 37:14.984
She dressed it in black.

37:15.150 --> 37:19.488
I heard a rumour that the kid was really
cracked and she couldn't handle it.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.365
He'd already fallen out
of the trolley jeep.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.951
Now, if something was
wrong with him...

37:24.952 --> 37:29.164
- And they're Seventh Day Adventists.
- They don't like abnormal children.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.626
Tell me what really
happened to your little

37:33.627 --> 37:36.088
sister. I won't tell
anybody else...

37:37.131 --> 37:41.635
Sergeant Charlwood, could you identify
the doctor that made those allegations?

37:42.428 --> 37:44.430
No comment.

37:45.681 --> 37:49.476
These are the slides I forgot to pick up
before we went to the... away.

37:49.643 --> 37:53.314
Mum and Dad! Come and have a look.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.692
Oh, yes. It's a new bike.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.821
That's Reagan.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.788
I didn't realise. I thought...

38:09.997 --> 38:12.875
It must have been at the end of a roll.

38:19.632 --> 38:22.051
I quite like that one.

38:22.217 --> 38:25.054
It's when she still had her hair.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.848
She was so beautiful. I wish you'd...

38:28.015 --> 38:30.184
I wish I'd seen her.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.690
The last time I stood
before you was also at

38:37.691 --> 38:40.653
the invitation of the
Chamberlain family.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.863
That was a happier day.

38:43.030 --> 38:46.617
We celebrated the birth
of their little daughter.

38:46.784 --> 38:49.828
We welcomed her
into the heart of our church,

38:50.371 --> 38:53.581
dedicating her life
to God and asking for

38:53.582 --> 38:56.502
his blessing and
guidance in her life,

38:56.669 --> 39:00.631
a life that has suddenly, sadly, ended.

39:00.798 --> 39:04.843
A lot of people watching would ask
why you're prepared to be interviewed.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.096
Hey, darl, come and have a look at this.

39:07.304 --> 39:09.598
Why are you making your grief so public?

39:09.765 --> 39:11.308
Jesus, what a wanker.

39:11.517 --> 39:18.148
We believe that this experience
has been needful for a lot of people,

39:18.315 --> 39:21.568
if they can realise too that...

39:21.735 --> 39:25.990
that there is a chance,
that there is an opportunity

39:26.156 --> 39:30.536
to be at peace, to be at rest,
with the help of the Lord.

39:31.745 --> 39:34.456
Michael's not in jail!

39:34.623 --> 39:37.042
No! He's not!

39:38.252 --> 39:41.296
He's at a church
convention in Townsville.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.174
The police?!

39:44.341 --> 39:46.635
They never!

39:46.802 --> 39:51.098
Oh, that's a load of Aussie bulldust.
They're playing games with you.

39:51.265 --> 39:54.560
I don't blame you being worried.

39:54.727 --> 39:57.980
Yeah, righto, Peter. Thanks for calling.

39:58.188 --> 39:59.606
Bye-

40:02.109 --> 40:03.860
Was that Michael's brother?

40:03.861 --> 40:06.447
The rumours are in
New Zealand already.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.282
A lie goes round the
world while truth's

40:09.283 --> 40:11.910
still putting its
boots on, sweetheart.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.163
I'm gonna do something about it.

40:16.165 --> 40:18.751
Chamberlain interview, take one.

40:19.585 --> 40:22.254
Tell us about some of
the rumours going around.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.423
Yes. One story is that...

40:24.631 --> 40:28.135
Yes. One story is that
we're part of a bizarre cult,

40:28.302 --> 40:34.016
that's part of the Jones massacre,
South America, that we're part of that.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.393
Another one that's
come back is because

40:37.394 --> 40:39.897
we're placing the cairn
at Ayers Rock...

40:40.064 --> 40:42.191
Thanks, Mum.

40:42.357 --> 40:45.444
...that this the other half
of a bizarre murder ritual,

40:45.611 --> 40:49.907
taking away the sins of the entire
Seventh Day Adventist church.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.534
This is a photo of Azaria's clothing.

40:52.743 --> 40:56.955
It shows bad blood stains
and a bad tear on the left arm.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.335
It would seem difficult for a dog
to get the baby out of there.

41:01.502 --> 41:06.006
Yes, well, if you've ever seen a dingo
eat, there's no difficulty at all.

41:06.590 --> 41:09.968
If you've seen them eat the carcass
of a cow, something like that,

41:10.135 --> 41:12.137
they never eat the skin.

41:12.304 --> 41:16.892
They use their feet like hands
and pull back the skin as they go.

41:17.059 --> 41:19.436
They just peel it like an orange.

41:20.938 --> 41:24.483
If you'll notice here,
on the hands, for instance,

41:24.691 --> 41:26.860
there is blood as well.

41:27.111 --> 41:30.072
- Tough little nut.
- You could crack walnuts on her face.

41:31.949 --> 41:34.367
Don't you understand
they're using you to

41:34.368 --> 41:36.912
sell their papers? People
love this rubbish!

41:37.121 --> 41:39.413
But they put us on the front page.
We're

41:39.414 --> 41:41.667
all over the television.
I won't have it!

41:41.834 --> 41:45.462
- This has got to stop.
- What they'd already written was worse.

41:45.629 --> 41:48.006
I tried to correct them
and give them the facts.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.425
Will you listen to me?

41:50.592 --> 41:53.512
These people aren't interested in facts.

42:06.525 --> 42:10.404
I'm told there's no trace of saliva
on the clothes. None whatsoever.

42:10.571 --> 42:11.696
What, none?

42:11.697 --> 42:14.073
Our experiments tell
us the cuts on the

42:14.074 --> 42:16.577
jump suit weren't made
by dingoes' teeth.

42:16.743 --> 42:18.162
Fine.

42:18.328 --> 42:19.872
Jesus Christ!

42:20.038 --> 42:24.418
The forensic blokes reckon there's no
way a dingo could have killed that kid.

42:24.585 --> 42:27.254
Not by the state the clothes were in.

42:27.421 --> 42:30.007
I tell you, these bloody Chamberlains!

42:30.174 --> 42:33.343
They wouldn't know the truth
if it hit 'em on the arse.

42:40.017 --> 42:41.142
Hello!

42:41.143 --> 42:43.061
- Hi. Mrs Chamberlain?
- Yes. Lindy.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.355
Graham Charlwood.
We spoke on the phone.

42:45.522 --> 42:48.567
Now I can put a face
to the voice. Come in.

42:50.986 --> 42:55.490
- I see you're packing up.
- We're moving back to Avondale College.

42:55.657 --> 42:58.869
- My husband's study leave came through.
- I'm glad I dropped by.

42:59.036 --> 43:03.916
- Gathering information for the inquest.
- It's about time something was done.

43:04.082 --> 43:07.544
The Northern Territory police
have been hopeless.

43:07.711 --> 43:09.796
I'm from the Northern Territory police.

43:09.963 --> 43:11.548
Oops.

43:11.715 --> 43:15.260
- This is my husband Michael.
- Graham Charlwood.

43:17.054 --> 43:19.139
Feeling is high in Alice Springs

43:19.306 --> 43:22.851
as the first sessions
of the Azaria Chamberlain inquest start.

43:23.018 --> 43:27.105
Alice Springs is
the focus of the nation's media.

43:28.148 --> 43:30.566
Do you still have
faith in your religion?

43:30.567 --> 43:32.903
Our faith has been
strengthened by this.

43:33.111 --> 43:35.906
Pastor, you believe Azaria's death
was an act of God?

43:36.114 --> 43:41.286
Mrs Chamberlain, is it true you felt
depressed after the birth of Azaria?

43:41.453 --> 43:44.873
Was Azaria's death a punishment
for travelling on your Sabbath?

43:45.082 --> 43:49.878
Is it not the case that you wrote some
sort of thesis on dingoes at college?

43:50.045 --> 43:52.965
It is not the case.
That's a press invention.

43:53.173 --> 43:55.926
That arose from the Woman's Day article.

43:56.093 --> 43:58.553
I thought it came from a newspaper.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.139
Was the Woman's Day article accurate?

44:01.348 --> 44:04.309
No. It was the most
inaccurate article of all,

44:04.476 --> 44:07.187
or at least of the ones
that I've read so far.

44:08.605 --> 44:10.273
In fact there are
only about five

44:10.274 --> 44:12.359
reporters who write
exactly what you say.

44:12.567 --> 44:15.529
The rest of them use a
little bit of license.

44:19.533 --> 44:24.246
Perhaps I could read you
something from Dr Brown's report.

44:24.413 --> 44:27.498
"There were several small cuts
in the baby blankets,

44:27.499 --> 44:30.168
but there was no evidence
of tooth marks."

44:31.837 --> 44:34.548
Well? Teeth cut, don't they?

44:34.715 --> 44:38.218
A forensic dentist finds
no evidence of tooth marks.

44:38.385 --> 44:41.555
- Does that concern you?
- Of course it concerns me.

44:41.722 --> 44:46.351
But if he can't say what happened,
how can he say what didn't happen?

44:46.893 --> 44:49.688
So you're not prepared
to accept his expertise in...

44:49.855 --> 44:52.690
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying what I'd

44:52.691 --> 44:55.735
like is a full answer,
not a half answer.

44:55.736 --> 44:59.323
I'd like to know more
than anyone else...

44:59.489 --> 45:01.742
what happened to my...

45:01.908 --> 45:04.161
my baby daughter.

45:07.331 --> 45:10.542
They're a native creature of
this country, not a scapegoat!

45:10.709 --> 45:13.837
Yeah? What about 'em?
They're still a wild animal.

45:14.004 --> 45:16.590
They're native to Australia!
They're beautiful.

45:16.757 --> 45:20.177
If you tell me that that bitch is
innocent and a dingo is guilty,

45:20.344 --> 45:22.346
I'll punch your fuckin' head in.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.514
Choice! That's really lovely, Reg.

45:24.723 --> 45:27.517
Hands up all those that
think she's guilty.

45:29.102 --> 45:31.104
Come on!

45:32.481 --> 45:34.608
Now, Mr Chamberlain.

45:34.775 --> 45:37.235
Pastor!

45:37.402 --> 45:38.570
Pastor.

45:38.737 --> 45:41.490
If I could ask about
the hair colouring of the baby

45:41.656 --> 45:45.911
in the photograph you took of
Mrs Chamberlain at Ayers Rock.

45:47.788 --> 45:49.873
I'm sorry.
Would you repeat that, please?

45:50.040 --> 45:54.711
If I could ask about the hair colouring
of the baby in the photograph you took.

45:54.878 --> 45:57.089
We seek a short adjournment,
Your Worship.

45:57.297 --> 46:00.550
We support the
application, Your Worship.

46:01.385 --> 46:04.429
Court is adjourned for five minutes.

46:06.765 --> 46:10.394
Someone's threatened to kill you.
We think they're in the courthouse.

46:10.602 --> 46:13.104
In Alice Springs a death
threat interrupted

46:13.105 --> 46:14.898
the Azaria Chamberlain inquiry.

46:15.065 --> 46:17.483
Justice Barritt ordered
twentyfour-hour protection

46:17.484 --> 46:19.653
for the Chamberlains
after a threat...

46:19.820 --> 46:23.990
Justice Barritt will move the Azaria
Chamberlain inquest to Ayers Rock,

46:24.157 --> 46:29.329
to make an inspection of the Chamberlain
campsite and the barbecue area.

46:29.913 --> 46:33.291
Justice Barritt,
how accurate a re-creation is this?

46:33.458 --> 46:35.460
Mr Chamberlain, what were you cooking?

46:35.627 --> 46:39.423
Michael! Where were you
when you heard the baby cry?

46:45.470 --> 46:47.722
I don't believe it.

46:49.266 --> 46:51.268
Well, that's it.

46:51.435 --> 46:53.687
Why should I let them know how I feel?

46:53.854 --> 46:57.524
From now on, I'm gonna
keep myself to myself.

46:57.691 --> 47:00.569
Not gonna show them anything.

47:01.987 --> 47:04.948
People can turn on you like
a pack of hungry animals.

47:07.284 --> 47:10.579
What a racket! Probably be a bomb.

47:10.745 --> 47:13.331
Don't be ridiculous.

47:19.296 --> 47:22.424
- There's a bomb, is there?
- You've been informed, have you?

47:22.632 --> 47:23.842
No.

47:24.009 --> 47:26.219
Well, yeah. There's a bomb.

47:26.386 --> 47:30.682
We'll have to go out by the pool. When
we open the door, the media goes nuts.

47:30.891 --> 47:33.059
Waiting for a pyjama shot.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.438
I told you, Michael!

47:37.022 --> 47:42.736
To you, Pastor and Mrs Chamberlain,
and through you, to Aidan and Reagan,

47:42.903 --> 47:45.197
may I extend my deepest sympathy.

47:45.906 --> 47:48.699
You've not only suffered
the loss of your

47:48.700 --> 47:51.244
beloved child in
tragic circumstances,

47:51.411 --> 47:57.124
but you've all been subjected
to months of innuendoes, suspicion

47:57.125 --> 48:02.506
and some of the most malicious gossip
ever witnessed in this country.

48:02.672 --> 48:05.299
I've taken the unusual
step of permitting

48:05.300 --> 48:07.802
these proceedings to
be televised today

48:07.969 --> 48:10.972
in the hope that,
by direct and accurate communication,

48:11.139 --> 48:15.602
such innuendoes, suspicion
and gossip may cease.

48:16.061 --> 48:19.189
This case clearly emphasises
that a choice has to be made

48:19.356 --> 48:23.652
between dingoes on one hand,
and tourism on the other.

48:23.860 --> 48:27.947
Cheeky bastard. On national television!

48:27.948 --> 48:29.949
I've had the occasion
to criticise the

48:29.950 --> 48:32.077
work of the Northern
Territory police...

48:32.244 --> 48:34.620
He doesn't know shit
from clay, this fella!

48:34.621 --> 48:35.747
What's his religion?

48:35.914 --> 48:39.709
...reporting of the sprayed blood stain
on the exterior of the tent,

48:39.876 --> 48:44.214
resulted in this investigation being
diverted in the wrong direction.

48:44.381 --> 48:46.925
I'm satisfied that Dr Brown,

48:47.133 --> 48:49.970
an acknowledged expert
on bite marks of humans,

48:50.136 --> 48:52.639
used his best endeavours
to learn what he could

48:52.806 --> 48:56.518
of what had been, until this case,
an unknown field.

48:57.519 --> 48:59.938
In the light of
his straightforward admission,

49:00.105 --> 49:04.025
that he had no experience
in examining bite marks in clothing,

49:04.192 --> 49:08.488
it'd be dangerous to rely on
his evidence in that regard.

49:08.655 --> 49:10.782
I doth find

49:11.283 --> 49:14.911
Azaria Chantel Loren Chamberlain,
a child of nine weeks of age...

49:15.078 --> 49:19.415
- I think they're both bloody guilty.
- Shut up. Listen and learn something.

49:19.416 --> 49:22.543
...met her death when attacked
by a wild dingo,

49:22.544 --> 49:26.840
whilst asleep in the family's tent
at the top camping area, Ayers Rock.

49:27.465 --> 49:30.885
I further find that neither
the parents of the child,

49:31.094 --> 49:33.638
nor either of their remaining children,

49:33.805 --> 49:36.975
were in any degree
responsible for this death.

49:39.144 --> 49:42.105
I find that the name "Azaria"
does not mean and never has meant

49:42.272 --> 49:44.274
"sacrifice in the wilderness".

49:45.275 --> 49:47.944
I find that after her death,
the body of Azaria

49:48.111 --> 49:50.739
was taken from
the possession of the dingo

49:50.905 --> 49:53.742
and disposed of by an unknown method,

49:53.908 --> 49:57.078
by a person or persons, name unknown.

49:57.245 --> 49:59.873
Court is adjourned.

50:00.040 --> 50:04.586
Sergeant Charlwood, are you upset
by the coroner's decision?

50:11.259 --> 50:14.304
Why do you think people
wouldn't accept the dingo story?

50:14.471 --> 50:17.223
Perhaps because
this is the first in Australia.

50:17.390 --> 50:20.560
Michael, what's accounted
for your strength?

50:20.769 --> 50:25.231
The Lord Jesus Christ is
a very dear friend of ours, our saviour.

50:25.398 --> 50:29.361
The peace of God has kept us from
being very foolish in our own lives.

50:30.528 --> 50:36.201
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
something here that you may like to see.

50:38.787 --> 50:41.831
This is a picture of Azaria
as she really was,

50:42.415 --> 50:46.795
to prove to the world that she,
as you see, was the most beautiful baby.

50:46.961 --> 50:51.716
Look what these poor prawns are doing
now. Anything to get their heads on TV.

50:51.883 --> 50:54.511
Oh, yes. He's the top in his field.

50:55.428 --> 50:57.138
Professor Cameron.

50:57.305 --> 50:59.516
Yes. London.

51:00.475 --> 51:03.937
And he's very keen to examine
the jump suit in particular.

51:04.104 --> 51:08.650
Apparently I need permission from the
minister to take it out of the country.

51:08.817 --> 51:11.486
Oh, no. I'm going anyway,
so there's no cost involved.

51:12.028 --> 51:14.906
I'd like to welcome,
as the new semester begins,

51:15.115 --> 51:17.117
all the new students and their families

51:17.283 --> 51:20.453
who've come to live
and study with us at Avondale.

51:21.329 --> 51:24.039
I mention one family in particular.

51:24.040 --> 51:26.208
That of Pastor Michael and Lindy

51:26.209 --> 51:29.170
Chamberlain, for the
fine example they set

51:29.337 --> 51:32.465
when the world harshly
judged them and their church.

51:32.632 --> 51:36.344
Lindy, Michael, you've become
household names in the past six months.

51:36.511 --> 51:39.139
- How's that affected your lives?
- We're managing.

51:39.305 --> 51:43.143
Things are starting to settle down.
The boys are in their new school.

51:43.309 --> 51:46.478
Michael's started his MA course.
That'll take about a year.

51:46.479 --> 51:49.691
Then we're off to America
for his doctorate.

51:49.858 --> 51:52.652
That would be a doctorate in theology?

51:52.819 --> 51:55.488
- Give us a break!
- A doctorate in health science.

51:55.655 --> 51:58.575
So we'll have to call you
Dr Chamberlain, Michael.

51:58.742 --> 52:00.910
I don't know about that, but...

52:01.077 --> 52:05.039
I suppose so, but we're just
a couple of ordinary Australians.

52:05.248 --> 52:10.754
- What are your plans, Lindy?
- I've got a new house to get organised.

52:10.920 --> 52:14.174
And I'm also starting
my Bachelor of Education.

52:15.258 --> 52:19.928
Rumours still persist
about that tragic night at Ayers Rock.

52:19.929 --> 52:23.683
We ignore them.
The court put that straight.

52:23.933 --> 52:26.227
These are the product of sick minds.

52:26.394 --> 52:29.355
We seem to have our fair share of those,

52:29.522 --> 52:33.985
in places that you wouldn't
really expect to find them, too.

52:34.152 --> 52:36.613
So, it's full steam
ahead for the future?

52:36.780 --> 52:38.782
- We hope so.
- You bet.

52:40.492 --> 52:46.289
I'll ask the questions. I'll do the
noddies in-between. Is the tie straight?

52:47.373 --> 52:51.127
Lindy, Michael, you've become
household names in the last six months.

52:51.336 --> 52:54.130
How's this affected your lives?

53:01.346 --> 53:03.348
Righto, let's run through it again.

53:03.556 --> 53:07.268
Team two is going to Melbourne, to the
Whittackers, team three to the Habys.

53:07.435 --> 53:10.772
Team four flies to Western Australia,
Esperance, to the Wests.

53:10.939 --> 53:13.149
Team five to Hobart to the Lowes.

53:13.316 --> 53:16.109
It's essential that
everybody be ready to

53:16.110 --> 53:18.655
make contact with our
targets at 0800.

53:18.863 --> 53:22.158
No slip-ups.
I want these witnesses hit cold.

53:22.367 --> 53:25.912
I don't want one lot ringing another lot
before we can question them.

53:26.496 --> 53:29.666
- Michael?
- Hi, Helen. Lindy!

53:33.878 --> 53:37.423
I've gotta go shopping.
Can I dump this brute on you?

53:37.590 --> 53:40.218
Anything to get out of mowing.

53:41.344 --> 53:43.638
- Hello, Murray.
- You be a good boy.

53:43.805 --> 53:46.266
Let's go goo at the chooks, shall we?

53:52.480 --> 53:54.899
What are you looking for, sweetheart?

53:55.066 --> 53:57.402
Nothing.

53:57.569 --> 53:59.654
Are you sure?

53:59.821 --> 54:02.323
Can I help you look for it?

54:02.532 --> 54:04.742
What is it? Hey.

54:07.245 --> 54:10.874
Did the dingo take
our new bubby too, Mummy?

54:11.833 --> 54:13.501
What? Murray?

54:15.211 --> 54:16.546
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:16.713 --> 54:19.007
We need to see Murray, Auntie Helen.

54:19.173 --> 54:21.467
I've just put him down for the night.

54:21.634 --> 54:24.679
We need to see if he's OK.

54:24.888 --> 54:25.889
Oh!

54:29.767 --> 54:32.729
See, darling? There he is.

54:32.896 --> 54:36.316
Back safe and sound
with his own mummy and daddy.

54:41.279 --> 54:42.739
Lindy!

54:42.906 --> 54:44.908
I'm in here.

54:51.247 --> 54:53.458
These are for you, love.

54:58.212 --> 55:00.882
Well, it's the 17th...

55:01.049 --> 55:03.217
and I thought a gesture was in order

55:03.384 --> 55:08.222
to mark the anniversary
of our unfortunate...

55:13.394 --> 55:15.855
It took hours to find them.

55:18.441 --> 55:20.443
She was so beautiful...

55:22.028 --> 55:25.573
and I wanted something
beautiful for you...

55:25.740 --> 55:27.742
in her memory.

55:32.580 --> 55:36.042
I get so angry and frustrated, you know?

55:36.209 --> 55:38.211
Because...

55:40.046 --> 55:42.048
I hardly even knew her.

55:43.091 --> 55:46.135
I hardly even took any notice of her.

55:48.763 --> 55:50.765
I hardly knew Azaria.

56:00.149 --> 56:02.694
Did you hear the one
about the Irish dingo?

56:02.860 --> 56:04.862
It ate the tent!

56:06.739 --> 56:10.493
OK. We got about 90 seconds,
so just make it right.

56:10.702 --> 56:12.495
Let's go.

56:12.662 --> 56:16.207
OK, control, this is units one and two.
We're on the move. Out.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.471
- Can I help you?
- Mrs West?

56:32.390 --> 56:33.390
Mrs Lowe?

56:33.391 --> 56:35.435
Is this the Whittackers'?

56:42.900 --> 56:45.445
G'day, Aidan. Your mum and dad home?

56:45.611 --> 56:48.614
Uh, yeah. Come in and I'll get them.

56:48.781 --> 56:50.783
Right, thanks.

56:57.206 --> 57:01.294
G'day. How are you?
Get you out of the bath, did we?

57:01.461 --> 57:04.672
- What can we do for you?
- A warrant was issued yesterday

57:04.839 --> 57:07.633
to search your premises
for certain property.

57:07.800 --> 57:10.428
- Can I see that?
- What's this in connection with?

57:10.595 --> 57:13.264
There's fresh information.
Forensic evidence.

57:13.431 --> 57:15.892
What sort of evidence?

57:16.059 --> 57:20.396
All I can tell you is the chief
minister's ordered a new investigation.

57:20.563 --> 57:23.900
- Feel free to get dressed.
- Do you realise today's our Sabbath?

57:30.448 --> 57:34.160
Excuse me. I expect the cupboards
to be put back the way they were.

57:34.327 --> 57:37.205
How long will you have
our things this time?

57:38.247 --> 57:42.168
- Rest assured compensation's available.
- What about the damage last time?

57:42.335 --> 57:46.547
- Boys, don't ruin Mummy's oven.
- We received no compensation last time.

57:46.714 --> 57:51.677
Can you tell me why things that weren't
even at Ayers Rock are going?

57:52.261 --> 57:54.555
I don't give a fuck
about a freeway accident.

57:54.722 --> 57:56.890
I've got a tip that
the Chamberlain case

57:56.891 --> 57:58.935
has been reopened. I
want that chopper.

57:59.102 --> 58:02.355
- I dunno. There's some new evidence.
- What new evidence?

58:02.563 --> 58:05.316
The coppers won't tell you everything.

58:08.319 --> 58:10.863
Hey, Jim. Have a look at this.

58:14.200 --> 58:18.663
"Heber's wife took a nail of the tent
and took a hammer in her hand,

58:18.871 --> 58:22.542
and went softly unto him
and smote the nail into his temples."

58:30.508 --> 58:32.385
Is this the green tent?

58:32.552 --> 58:37.181
No, that's a brown and orange tent.
The green tent's under here.

58:37.348 --> 58:39.559
- Sarge, got this?
- Yeah, we'll take that.

58:39.725 --> 58:42.186
There's another one up there.

58:45.148 --> 58:47.817
Do you want this?

58:51.904 --> 58:55.574
- Is the car available, Mr Chamberlain?
- It's being fixed at the lake.

58:55.575 --> 58:58.119
I'll take you there myself.
You'd never find it.

58:58.286 --> 59:00.413
Jesus Christ!

59:00.580 --> 59:02.540
What's this?

59:03.624 --> 59:08.212
Oh, yes. That's for public-health
lectures. To scare smokers, you know?

59:08.379 --> 59:09.881
Why have you still got it?

59:10.047 --> 59:13.551
Christ knows how
they fitted all this in one car.

59:14.135 --> 59:16.137
Is this your camera bag?

59:16.304 --> 59:19.765
Yeah, but it's not the one
I had at the Rock.

59:19.932 --> 59:22.018
I'll get it for you.

59:29.942 --> 59:34.906
Michael. The switchboard's jammed with
calls from the press. What's happening?

59:35.072 --> 59:39.619
It seems they've reopened
the inquiries...

59:44.665 --> 59:47.793
How come the press know so soon?

59:47.960 --> 59:51.214
- I don't talk to the press.
- This is shocking for all of us.

59:51.422 --> 59:56.135
New evidence has come to hand on
the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain.

59:56.302 --> 01:00:00.890
Police will review all evidence
and investigations will begin anew.

01:00:01.057 --> 01:00:04.685
Sir, does this mean
you're anticipating a second inquest?

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:06.520
No comment.

01:00:06.729 --> 01:00:09.064
My mate in Darwin knows
the sister of the

01:00:09.065 --> 01:00:11.442
brother-in-law of the
copper on this case.

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:16.906
They reckon she's covering up for her
kid. That's why they can't break her.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.367
Would you like to trot
that past me again?

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:22.869
I understand they found
a white baby coffin

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.665
in the house, with
a Bible passage...

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:28.250
For goodness' sake,
give it a bloody rest.

01:00:28.251 --> 01:00:30.169
Let me tell you
what it was about.

01:00:30.962 --> 01:00:35.466
I've never asked you this before,
but did you kill your baby?

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.969
If I answered,
I'd be giving you an interview,

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.721
and my lawyer has advised me
not speak to you alone.

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:44.141
I'd deny the conversation
ever took place.

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.770
Come on, it's just between you and me.

01:00:47.937 --> 01:00:51.023
- Did you kill your baby?
- Oh, come on!

01:00:52.024 --> 01:00:56.404
If I'd done it, why invent such
an unbelievable story about a dingo?

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.157
Don't sell yourself short.

01:01:01.367 --> 01:01:04.662
You're crediting me
with the perfect murder.

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.831
Don't sell yourself short!

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:12.420
The baby's clothes are being examined
by Professor Cameron in London.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:16.424
Oh, I didn't know
there were any dingo experts in London.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:21.971
He's a world-class forensic scientist.
He found a hand print on the jump suit.

01:01:22.138 --> 01:01:24.765
It was made when it was wet with blood.

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:27.685
It's a small, female hand.

01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:30.271
Then I'm back in the hot seat, aren't I?

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:37.778
What else was in this report?

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:40.156
The baby was decapitated.

01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:45.661
Professor Cameron,
the leading forensic pathologist,

01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:48.873
tended ultraviolet photographs,
revealing baby Azaria

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.460
was held by a human hand
while she was still bleeding.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:56.630
This evidence appears to be supported
by the discovery of an arterial spray

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:59.300
on the under-dash
of the Chamberlains' car,

01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:03.637
consistent with the spray
from an artery of a cutthroat.

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:07.767
The second inquest into
the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.394
reached a sensational conclusion today.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.272
Lindy Chamberlain
was committed for trial today,

01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:17.109
charged with the murder
of her ten-week-old daughter Azaria.

01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:20.905
Her husband Michael was charged
as an accessory after the fact.

01:02:29.497 --> 01:02:31.457
How can they?

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.086
How can they, the bastards?!

01:02:35.294 --> 01:02:38.547
I'm sorry. That's the only
word for them - bastards!

01:02:38.714 --> 01:02:41.759
Don't they know
how much we loved her?!

01:02:45.054 --> 01:02:48.391
I don't know what God wants any more.

01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:50.101
You know?

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:54.605
How could he take her?
I thought I knew the answer but I don't.

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:56.774
I don't!

01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:06.617
We're frightened, Lord, and we're tired.

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:11.372
We know we're on show

01:03:11.539 --> 01:03:14.041
and we ask you for help...

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:18.963
to let us find the strength
to swallow the anger and the hurt...

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:21.132
and to find the courage...

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.718
to face the future.

01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:28.764
Amen.

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:40.317
Michael, are we gonna do
like we planned?

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:44.613
Try and have another baby?

01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:49.577
I worked it out...

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.412
and it's now or never.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:56.584
Because if I go to jail,
I'll never have another chance.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.503
And if I don't,
why should they run our lives?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.842
It's time, darling.

01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:10.848
If we start now,
I won't be showing at the trial.

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:14.351
And when it's all over,
no one need ever have known.

01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:21.609
The boys are praying for
a little baby sister.

01:04:23.319 --> 01:04:25.905
- So am I.
- Prayer.

01:04:26.113 --> 01:04:31.035
What good is prayer?
The only thing God's good for right now

01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:36.749
is stopping me from cutting my throat,
because that's what I feel like doing.

01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:39.084
Hell can't be worse than this.

01:04:42.171 --> 01:04:44.840
My life is finished!

01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:47.676
How can I be a pastor any more?

01:04:47.843 --> 01:04:52.973
Who'd listen to someone who was
supposed to have helped kill a child?

01:04:54.475 --> 01:04:56.727
I don't know what to do.

01:04:58.604 --> 01:05:00.981
I don't know where to start.

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:06.278
Is there any reason why there'd be
a quantity of blood in your car?

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:09.448
Well, the kids have had
cuts and bumps in the car.

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:11.534
And nosebleeds.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.538
Azaria vomited once or twice,
if that means anything.

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:19.500
And we're trained first-aiders.
We've attended some bad road accidents.

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:24.046
Michael, what was the name
of that bloke we picked up in Cairns?

01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:26.465
- Michael?
- What difference does it make?

01:05:26.632 --> 01:05:31.762
- Well, he bled like a stuck pig.
- Is there any hope of finding him?

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:35.140
I don't know his name.
I don't know where he lives.

01:05:35.391 --> 01:05:38.644
Cairns is a big town,
and it was 18 months ago.

01:05:38.811 --> 01:05:42.147
Besides, it doesn't explain
the blood under the dashboard.

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:44.525
I'll be back in a minute.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:53.117
Cockatoos are white, red, and...
They can be all kinds of colours.

01:05:53.284 --> 01:05:56.036
Why won't Daddy walk with us?

01:05:56.245 --> 01:05:58.455
- Cos he's cracked.
- He's what?

01:05:58.664 --> 01:06:03.127
He's concerned for our safety. He's
walking ahead in case someone's there.

01:06:03.294 --> 01:06:05.296
I think he's cracked.

01:06:13.262 --> 01:06:15.556
You're right. It's the
same model as mine.

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:19.184
Have a look at what
Webber found under the dash.

01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:24.773
I don't believe this. This is identical.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.652
I reckon there's a
real possibility here.

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:32.489
- Can I photograph this?
- You can cut it out if you want to.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:35.283
It's incredible. They
must be cracked!

01:06:35.284 --> 01:06:38.037
Nobody's gonna believe
that line of bull.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:40.456
Let me get this straight.
In ten minutes,

01:06:40.623 --> 01:06:44.918
I'm supposed to have taken the baby
back to the tent, put her down,

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:47.338
put on my tracksuit pants, right?

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:49.632
Carted her off to the car,

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:53.010
cut her throat, cut her head off
with the nail scissors,

01:06:53.177 --> 01:06:56.639
stuffed her body in the camera bag -
have you seen the size of that?

01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:59.223
And I hurry up and
clean up the blood out

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:01.685
the car, then pick up
a can of baked beans

01:07:01.852 --> 01:07:05.480
because Aidan, who's
been here all the time,

01:07:05.481 --> 01:07:08.525
watching, I suppose,
is still hungry.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:12.446
So I take him back to the tent
and take off my tracksuit pants

01:07:12.613 --> 01:07:17.409
and sprinkle blood - my own baby's
blood - round the tent, and on Reagan.

01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:19.536
And then...

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:24.541
When do I make the little dingo tracks
round the tent? Round then, I suppose.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:30.255
Then we have a happy race back to the
barbecue, as if nothing had happened.

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:33.174
It sounds preposterous
but that is the Crown's case.

01:07:33.175 --> 01:07:35.636
Look what I found.

01:07:35.803 --> 01:07:39.264
It's exactly the same as
the spray under our dashboard.

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:40.974
Good on you, mate.

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:43.769
- That's the good news today.
- What's the matter?

01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:46.480
- They reset the trial for September.
- September?

01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:51.694
I'll be seven months pregnant.
I'll look like Humpty Dumpty.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.697
They can't do that.
The press'll slaughter us!

01:08:03.497 --> 01:08:06.458
They should go back to Glenis,
bless her soul.

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:08.377
Oh, wait a minute.

01:08:08.544 --> 01:08:11.672
I might be able to let
this out just enough.

01:08:13.048 --> 01:08:15.300
Let's see this. Mm, yes.

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:19.805
Michael! Any last-minute requests?

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:22.975
This is your last chance.

01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:27.187
Boys.

01:08:27.813 --> 01:08:31.608
Come on in, then!
Help me close up these suitcases.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.694
Come on. Hop up here. Come on.

01:08:35.904 --> 01:08:39.366
Just bung you on here. Squash it down.

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:41.535
That's it.

01:08:45.581 --> 01:08:48.124
Speculation here in
Darwin is whether the

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:50.669
most publicised pregnancy
this decade...

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:55.048
Lindy and I are most grateful
for your offering to put us up, Pastor.

01:08:55.215 --> 01:09:00.179
We thought you'd be better off here,
away from the craziness,

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:03.390
where we can keep
an eye on you, as it were.

01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:14.651
Here we are. It's not the Hilton,
but under the circumstances...

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:19.363
He can't mean us to
live in a garden shed.

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:23.452
The shower and toilet's
down the path, under the house.

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:26.871
The media'll love this.
They'll know every

01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:29.957
time I go to the loo.
This is impossible.

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:32.877
I think we may be more comfortable
where we booked.

01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:35.921
I took the liberty of
cancelling that. It'll

01:09:35.923 --> 01:09:38.634
be gone by now. There's
not a bed in town.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:40.676
Thanks to us.

01:09:49.353 --> 01:09:51.854
Look at that face! It'd turn milk sour.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:55.400
Burn the bitch!

01:09:57.736 --> 01:10:02.157
The Chamberlains arrived at Darwin court
today for the first day of their trial

01:10:02.324 --> 01:10:05.035
for the murder
of their baby daughter Azaria.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:08.538
Lindy was wearing a pink and white frock
with white accessories.

01:10:08.539 --> 01:10:13.085
Women are trying to work out when
the baby is due, and also the zodiac.

01:10:13.252 --> 01:10:15.671
My guess is Scorpio.

01:10:20.676 --> 01:10:25.180
Your job in this case is
to administer justice according to law.

01:10:25.347 --> 01:10:30.686
Not according to rumour, not according
to preconceived notions of.

01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:33.646
You will hear much of this,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:37.693
for the simple reason that possibly
the publicity concerning this matter

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.779
has been without precedent
in our lifetime.

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:44.700
You see in this court
a couple of cameras.

01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:48.996
I don't want you to feel that you're
being directly telecast to Australia.

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:53.375
That is not so. They were put in
for the convenience of the press.

01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:59.965
OK, who wants to be in it?
Tickets are a dollar apiece.

01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:02.092
The one who gets
the birthday gets the lot.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:06.680
Was there anything in Mrs Chamberlain's
demeanour on her return to the barbecue

01:11:06.889 --> 01:11:10.100
that indicated
anything abnormal had happened?

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:13.645
No. She seemed solely concerned
with feeding Aidan more food.

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:15.814
Was she covered in blood?

01:11:16.023 --> 01:11:17.774
No.

01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:24.364
As to the baby's cry, did that
cry appear to you to be cut off?

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:28.994
Going from experience
with other babies, yes.

01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:31.580
It was a relatively uneventful day

01:11:31.747 --> 01:11:35.876
as eyewitnesses to that tragic night
at Ayers Rock gave evidence.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:38.378
The witnesses from across Australia

01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:40.671
shed little light on
the events that led

01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:42.716
up to the disappearance
of baby Azaria.

01:11:42.883 --> 01:11:45.928
Everyone that was there
were her friends, her witnesses.

01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:49.723
- They were all Adventists.
- They didn't know each other!

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:53.143
- It was a ritual killing!
- They planned it all, did they?

01:11:53.602 --> 01:11:57.481
The buckle gave me very strongly
positive reactions for blood.

01:11:57.648 --> 01:11:59.650
What about the spray pattern?

01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:02.319
The pattern under the dash

01:12:02.486 --> 01:12:05.656
gave me a very positive reaction
for foetal haemoglobin.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:10.243
Correct me if I'm wrong, Mrs Kuhl,
but you've got 22 positive reactions

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:15.791
for the presence of foetal blood...
um, haemoglobin, from these tests.

01:12:15.958 --> 01:12:17.584
That is correct.

01:12:17.793 --> 01:12:19.836
Did the tests lead you to an opinion

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:23.173
of the person whose blood
you found and the age of that person?

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.675
They did.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:30.013
It was consistent with the blood having
come from a baby under three months.

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:34.017
You bitch!

01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:39.898
What about when you took
the jury to view the car?

01:12:40.065 --> 01:12:44.319
She was behind me, staring. I could
feel her burning holes through my back.

01:12:44.528 --> 01:12:48.073
She just stares! She's
a witch, you know.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.950
I can't stand the way
she flutters her

01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:53.912
eyes at the jury. Makes
me want to vomit.

01:12:54.955 --> 01:12:59.042
I reckon she's got something
going with that copper, too.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:02.879
Mm-hm! Active little monkey tonight!

01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:06.883
- Come have a feel.
- Not just now, my dear.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.761
And what about the outfit? Polka dot.

01:13:09.928 --> 01:13:14.391
Practically the same as mine.
Not to mention the hairdo.

01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:20.147
It's easy enough to dislike the woman
without her adding insult to injury.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:27.779
That is a demonstration photograph
of an Ouchterlony plate.

01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:30.866
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Buggered if I know.

01:13:31.033 --> 01:13:32.158
It's the what?

01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:36.747
You can get a positive reaction to milk.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:42.377
It's not the same type of reaction
as blood, but you do get one. Can.

01:13:42.586 --> 01:13:45.547
- Vomit?
- Due to the traces of blood in it, yes.

01:13:45.714 --> 01:13:47.506
- Saliva?
- No.

01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:49.885
- Never?
- Not that I have seen.

01:13:50.052 --> 01:13:51.802
Nasal secretions?

01:13:51.803 --> 01:13:55.849
There is often blood
in those secretions.

01:13:56.016 --> 01:13:58.477
- The answer is yes?
- Yes.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:01.104
If blood was in saliva,
the answer would be yes?

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:03.231
Yes.

01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:06.068
- Rust?
- Sometimes. Sometimes not.

01:14:06.276 --> 01:14:09.029
You can get a positive reaction to rust?

01:14:09.196 --> 01:14:11.990
Sometimes, with some rusts. Yes.

01:14:12.157 --> 01:14:14.326
Is it a fact that after
four days' screening,

01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:17.537
you cannot prove the presence
of blood in the compartments

01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:21.208
or the base
of the Chamberlain camera bag?

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.877
No. My report states that.

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:28.632
What about the real thing? The actual
Ouchterlony plates at end of your tests?

01:14:28.799 --> 01:14:31.051
- Do you produce those?
- No.

01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:33.678
- They're in Sydney, are they?
- No.

01:14:33.845 --> 01:14:36.890
- Where are they?
- They have been destroyed.

01:14:38.058 --> 01:14:40.060
- All of them?
- Yes.

01:14:40.227 --> 01:14:42.019
Whose decision was that?

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:45.107
It's standard procedure
in our laboratory.

01:14:46.191 --> 01:14:49.778
Professor Chaikin, you examined
the tufts from the camera bag

01:14:49.945 --> 01:14:52.572
to see whether they could have
come from the jump suit.

01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:54.949
I did, yes.

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:59.329
I would, if you don't mind, Your Honour,
demonstrate it by cutting it.

01:15:00.622 --> 01:15:03.250
The mighty Chaikin!

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:06.628
- Get off!
- And now, for my next trick...

01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:10.382
And you cut it. Some tufts fall off.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.426
And you can shake some off.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:18.264
Are you able to express
an opinion as to

01:15:18.265 --> 01:15:21.059
whether a dingo's teeth
made those cuts?

01:15:21.643 --> 01:15:23.645
I would say no.

01:15:23.812 --> 01:15:26.898
These are Lindy Chamberlain's scissors.

01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:30.902
Are these the scissors
you first used in your cutting tests?

01:15:31.069 --> 01:15:32.195
Yes.

01:15:32.404 --> 01:15:34.781
- And?
- They came apart.

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:39.911
The scissors you used for the tests,
are they larger than the Chamberlains'?

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.246
Yes.

01:15:41.413 --> 01:15:44.290
So far more efficient
for your purposes?

01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:45.292
Yes.

01:15:45.876 --> 01:15:50.422
I concede that the Chamberlain
scissors, as I received them,

01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:53.383
could not cut jump suit material.

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:58.680
- They're trying to blame a dingo?
- Have you seen a dingo using scissors?

01:15:58.889 --> 01:16:00.891
Not really.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:04.728
- Lindy Chamberlain showed no emotion.
- There's Mum and Dad!

01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:07.355
Can we ring 'em?

01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:09.107
Maybe tomorrow, eh?

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:18.700
We have to turn the
air conditioning off. I'm cold.

01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:22.245
- You can't possibly be cold.
- I'm freezing.

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.623
Then put a blanket on yourself.

01:16:24.831 --> 01:16:27.917
I'd rather have the
air conditioning off.

01:16:27.918 --> 01:16:29.753
Leave it. I'm roasting!

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.256
You seem to forget I've got
a little furnace blazing away in here.

01:16:33.465 --> 01:16:36.051
If you want my company,
then put a blanket on.

01:16:36.218 --> 01:16:38.845
The last thing I want now
is to put a blanket over me.

01:16:39.012 --> 01:16:42.515
- Go in the other room then.
- All right, I will.

01:16:48.396 --> 01:16:52.359
We should have got that zip fixed
so it was safe.

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:55.904
Love, it wouldn't have
made any difference.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:17:00.367
We should have got it fixed
and seen to it that it was zipped up.

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.743
What about the dingo
they told us about

01:17:02.744 --> 01:17:05.121
that clawed its way
into the tent for food?

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:08.333
We should have zipped up the tent!

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:13.921
You mean I should have zipped it up.
Isn't that what you mean? Say it!

01:17:13.922 --> 01:17:17.425
Say it! Have the guts
for once to say it!

01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:41.283
- Girls, did you make your T-shirts?
- Yes, we did.

01:17:41.449 --> 01:17:46.079
Can you imagine a situation where
the dingo was able to attack the child,

01:17:46.246 --> 01:17:48.748
pick it up and carry it by the face?

01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:52.210
No. Dogs usually go for
the back of the neck or the shoulder.

01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:57.882
Now, in this case, having regard
for the condition of the jump suit,

01:17:58.049 --> 01:18:03.013
can you see the child being grabbed
by a dog by the back of her neck?

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:07.309
Not from examination
of the collar of the jump suit, no.

01:18:07.475 --> 01:18:12.397
Would you have a look at
this photograph, please, Mr Simms?

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:19.070
Do you concede,
having seen the photograph,

01:18:19.279 --> 01:18:21.698
that a dog could easily
encompass the head

01:18:21.865 --> 01:18:25.327
of a child of Azaria's size in its jaws?

01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:31.458
Well, if that doll's head
is not being forced into the dog's jaws,

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:34.794
I would accept that.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:46.348
Mr Harris, what is the purpose of a
dingo gripping the head of the prey?

01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:50.060
The purpose is to immobilise
the prey immediately,

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:52.520
and preferably kill it at the same time.

01:18:52.687 --> 01:18:56.608
There'd be very little blood
because the heart would stop pumping.

01:18:56.775 --> 01:19:01.404
I have documented a dingo running
with a 20lb baby kangaroo in its mouth

01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:03.656
over a distance of some 200 yards.

01:19:03.823 --> 01:19:07.911
We've heard evidence a dingo in the
family tent was seen to shake its head.

01:19:08.119 --> 01:19:12.707
That's quite consistent.
The shake's obviously intended...

01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:15.168
to break the neck.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.671
You are now to be
shown videotape of an

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:22.467
experiment performed
at an Adelaide zoo.

01:19:22.634 --> 01:19:26.805
While you're looking at this tape,
recall the evidence of Mr Simms

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:30.057
where he concurred,
because of this experiment,

01:19:30.058 --> 01:19:33.311
a dingo could take out
a baby goat from a suit

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:35.980
while undoing only the two top buttons.

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:39.192
And is therefore reasonable to assume

01:19:39.359 --> 01:19:44.864
that a dingo eating
a baby human being out of its suit...

01:19:45.407 --> 01:19:48.701
is quite within the
bounds of probability.

01:19:52.122 --> 01:19:54.165
How's our side doing?

01:19:54.332 --> 01:19:58.752
Well, we figure we're up against about
four not-guiltys and four don't-knows.

01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:02.132
- The women are the big problem.
- Remind them where they live.

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:10.097
Professor Cameron, in
your view is there

01:20:10.098 --> 01:20:12.559
any evidence on those
articles of clothing

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:16.438
which suggests the child
was killed by a dingo?

01:20:19.107 --> 01:20:21.651
I saw no evidence
on these garments to suggest

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:24.654
a member of the canine family
was involved.

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:28.992
In your opinion, is there any evidence
suggesting the child was not killed

01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:31.453
by a member of the canine family?

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:35.540
There is evidence to suggest there was
an incised wound around the neck.

01:20:35.707 --> 01:20:37.584
In other words, a cut throat.

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:45.049
This photograph was taken
using ultraviolet light.

01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:49.345
You can see the pattern
of bloodied fingers.

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:55.268
And here, what may be a thumb. It's the
impression of a hand of a small adult.

01:20:56.478 --> 01:21:00.190
- That's a thumb?
- If that's a hand, I'm a virgin.

01:21:01.232 --> 01:21:06.613
Would you align your finger along the
mark that impressed Professor Cameron?

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:11.659
I object to that. The hand is flat.

01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:14.120
Noted.

01:21:14.287 --> 01:21:16.789
How many smudges do you see?

01:21:17.415 --> 01:21:19.542
One, two, three, four.

01:21:20.335 --> 01:21:23.296
Would you hold your finger up, please?

01:21:23.463 --> 01:21:25.673
One, two, three.

01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:39.854
We're gonna take some of the wind out
of Professor Cameron's sails tomorrow.

01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:43.316
- We're gonna bring up the Confait case.
- What's that?

01:21:43.483 --> 01:21:45.860
This bloke Confait
was murdered in England.

01:21:46.069 --> 01:21:52.033
Three boys were sent to prison for life,
based on Professor Cameron's evidence.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.035
Three years later, the
evidence was totally

01:21:55.036 --> 01:21:57.330
discredited and the
boys were freed.

01:21:57.497 --> 01:22:02.627
Turns out they'd been nowhere
near the place at the time of death.

01:22:05.213 --> 01:22:08.466
The media are gonna be pleased.
I gotta go to the loo again.

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.635
Decoy time.

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:17.267
- Here she comes!
- It's not her.

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:23.022
Professor Cameron, when you gave
evidence in the Confait case,

01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:27.151
you weren't armed with the correct
knowledge of the circumstances.

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:29.571
I agree entirely.

01:22:29.737 --> 01:22:33.491
I want to suggest you have done
the same thing in this case.

01:22:33.658 --> 01:22:37.704
I should like to show
the professor photograph 10B.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.373
Would you call that a neat bundle?

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.667
No.

01:22:42.834 --> 01:22:46.462
Did you swear
"I rely entirely on Dr Scott's evidence

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:49.882
that there was no saliva present
on the jump suit?"

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:51.384
Correct.

01:22:51.551 --> 01:22:57.181
Yet Dr Scott states "There is no
guarantee there is no saliva elsewhere."

01:22:57.348 --> 01:22:59.684
There was no saliva
present on the samples.

01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:05.481
He said "There is no guarantee
there is no saliva elsewhere."

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:08.693
I would accept that.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:13.906
In court, John Phillips QC
told how evidence

01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:18.119
presented by Professor Cameron in a
London murder trial was discredited.

01:23:18.328 --> 01:23:20.996
That's silly, sweetheart.
Gran loves you.

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:26.252
- She won't let me play outside.
- She's just doing what Mummy told her.

01:23:26.461 --> 01:23:30.298
It's too dangerous
for you to play outside now.

01:23:31.341 --> 01:23:35.094
Because we're in the papers
so much and on the telly.

01:23:35.261 --> 01:23:38.930
Silly people get silly
ideas in their head.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:42.852
We wouldn't want one of them
to come and get you, would we?

01:23:44.854 --> 01:23:48.024
Yeah, won't be much longer now,
sweetheart.

01:23:55.782 --> 01:23:59.494
I've been looking at reactions
given by the different antisera

01:23:59.661 --> 01:24:03.831
against the blood samples
taken from the car.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.793
I think the court is
familiar from the past

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:10.254
that the antiserum
known as antihaemoglobin

01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:15.677
has in it antibodies that react with
both the alpha and beta molecular chains

01:24:15.843 --> 01:24:17.804
which are found in haemoglobins.

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:22.642
For example, a sample could have been
obtained from the baby's clothing.

01:24:22.809 --> 01:24:24.976
Such a model would
have made a perfect

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:27.230
control to see if your
serum was working.

01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:31.234
Jesus, how many more days of this?

01:24:32.694 --> 01:24:35.320
The trial faces five
days of forensic

01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:38.282
evidence that even
experts can't agree on.

01:24:38.449 --> 01:24:42.412
How is a jury supposed to make
conclusions from this evidence?

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.497
We could dispense with the jury.

01:24:44.706 --> 01:24:49.669
Orthotoluidine tests,
Ouchterlony plates and electrophoresis?

01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:53.005
Give you ten bucks if you can get
haptoglobin into a headline.

01:24:53.673 --> 01:24:56.718
We should be asking
why none of the Aboriginal trackers

01:24:56.884 --> 01:24:59.137
used in the search for baby Azaria

01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:02.390
have been called
to give evidence at this trial.

01:25:02.557 --> 01:25:05.601
You can't believe those bludgers.
They're always drunk.

01:25:16.195 --> 01:25:18.197
Michael.

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:22.243
Michael. You must get up.

01:25:24.537 --> 01:25:27.415
I don't know what I'm going to say.

01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:32.754
Just tell them the truth, sweetheart.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.882
Keep calm. Don't let them rattle you.

01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:38.384
And listen carefully.

01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:42.304
Is that the truth? That
your wife told you

01:25:42.305 --> 01:25:44.849
she saw a dingo coming
out of the tent,

01:25:45.016 --> 01:25:50.188
she thought it had Azeria...
sorry, Azaria.

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:54.817
And you didn't ever ask her
why she thought it had Azaria?

01:25:55.818 --> 01:25:58.738
The tent was empty.

01:25:58.905 --> 01:26:02.074
I'm sorry. Could you speak up?

01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:04.619
The tent was empty, Mr Barker.

01:26:04.786 --> 01:26:08.915
She'd seen the dingo
and the baby was gone.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:14.253
Did you not ask her did she see
the baby being carried by the dingo?

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.299
I don't recall asking her that.
I could have asked her.

01:26:18.466 --> 01:26:21.260
You tell us you don't remember?

01:26:21.469 --> 01:26:24.013
I don't remember asking that question.

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:29.769
Do you remember if she told you
if she saw the dingo carrying the baby?

01:26:29.936 --> 01:26:33.939
She never told me she saw the dingo
carrying the baby in its mouth.

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.106
Pardon?

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:39.153
She never told me she saw the dingo
carrying the baby in its mouth.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.322
In her mouth.

01:26:42.949 --> 01:26:44.700
In its mouth.

01:26:44.909 --> 01:26:49.997
Did she ever tell you she didn't see
the baby in the dingo's mouth?

01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:55.962
- You'll have to repeat that question.
- Did she ever tell you

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:59.882
she didn't see the baby
in the dingo's mouth?

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:05.012
Perhaps Mr Barker means
not what you've heard her say...

01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:08.599
She did... She did... She did...

01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:12.394
I'm sorry.

01:27:12.395 --> 01:27:15.147
That's all right if
you don't understand.

01:27:15.356 --> 01:27:17.483
I'm not...

01:27:18.401 --> 01:27:20.611
I'm aware of...

01:27:20.778 --> 01:27:23.656
I think what you're trying to ask me...

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:28.327
I'll ask Mr Barker
to put the question again?

01:27:28.494 --> 01:27:30.288
Yes, please.

01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:34.125
Would you put it again,
please, Mr Barker?

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:39.380
Did she ever tell you she did not see
the baby in the dingo's mouth?

01:27:41.632 --> 01:27:44.427
I can't answer that
question specifically.

01:27:44.594 --> 01:27:48.347
Did she ever tell you she saw nothing
in the dingo's mouth?

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:51.350
She told me the baby...

01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:56.480
She told me the dingo
appeared to have nothing in its mouth.

01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.233
I think.

01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:02.361
When did she tell you that?

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.741
I can't say.

01:28:06.908 --> 01:28:08.910
I don't know.

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:16.459
Get your face straight
before Michael comes in.

01:28:16.626 --> 01:28:18.628
He needs all the help he can get.

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:21.088
Well?

01:28:22.423 --> 01:28:25.176
- How did I go? I want the truth.
- You're doing fine.

01:28:25.343 --> 01:28:28.137
You had Barker working hard, sweetheart.

01:28:28.304 --> 01:28:31.349
Jesus, mate, you're a
bloody bad witness.

01:28:44.195 --> 01:28:47.113
If you'd been under
the hammer for hours

01:28:47.114 --> 01:28:50.159
and hours, you wouldn't
be in a fit state.

01:28:50.326 --> 01:28:53.037
He couldn't answer the question
because he was a mess.

01:28:53.204 --> 01:28:56.624
If he makes Chamberlain
look so emotionally incompetent,

01:28:56.791 --> 01:29:02.046
there's no way anyone will believe
he could keep up such a fantastic story.

01:29:02.672 --> 01:29:05.549
The clothing your child Azaria
was wearing,

01:29:05.716 --> 01:29:08.761
could we have the exhibits, please?
The jump suit?

01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:12.139
- How are you feeling? All right?
- Yes, thank you, Your Honour.

01:29:12.348 --> 01:29:14.266
Let me know if you're not.

01:29:14.433 --> 01:29:18.896
Perhaps I can approach this
in a different way, Your Honour?

01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:23.442
Without opening any of those articles,

01:29:23.609 --> 01:29:28.155
can you confirm they were
the clothing your child was wearing?

01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:31.575
Yes.

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:34.328
Right, put the clothing back.

01:29:34.495 --> 01:29:38.541
Please state what other article
Azaria was wearing.

01:29:41.002 --> 01:29:44.505
She had a white knitted
marquee matinee jacket

01:29:47.133 --> 01:29:50.761
with a pale lemon edging.

01:29:52.179 --> 01:29:57.059
What approximate age was this
matinee jacket Azaria was wearing?

01:29:57.226 --> 01:30:03.399
It had been given to me by a friend
who'd used it on two children before me.

01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:08.237
Some of the jury are upset now.

01:30:08.404 --> 01:30:11.907
We'll take a short break.
The court will rise for ten minutes.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.498
- The jury were upset. That's good.
- If it was for Lindy.

01:30:19.665 --> 01:30:21.917
If it was for the baby,
it's not so good.

01:30:22.084 --> 01:30:24.003
Could be bad.

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:29.133
I can't let that out any more.

01:30:31.218 --> 01:30:34.263
Blowed if I know
what I can wear tomorrow.

01:30:37.808 --> 01:30:40.268
I've never seen you quite so large.
Maybe if

01:30:40.269 --> 01:30:42.646
you cut down on the
eating just a little...

01:30:42.855 --> 01:30:45.691
You mean "quite so fat",
don't you, Michael?

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:50.029
You hate fat, right?
I've never been quite this fat, have I?

01:30:51.405 --> 01:30:54.158
I'm twice my normal pregnancy weight.
I wonder why.

01:30:54.325 --> 01:30:56.327
You can't stand to look at me.

01:30:56.494 --> 01:30:59.789
You're so afraid I'll never get
thin again, the way you like it.

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:03.000
You threatened once
to leave me if I got fat.

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:06.962
Well, darling, if Mr Barker has his way,

01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:10.633
the decision may be
right out of your hands.

01:31:18.891 --> 01:31:21.310
How are you bearing up, Lindy?

01:31:21.519 --> 01:31:24.480
How are you bearing up, Michael?

01:31:36.075 --> 01:31:39.120
Did you tell Constable Morris
about the matinee jacket?

01:31:39.286 --> 01:31:41.163
I did mention it.

01:31:41.372 --> 01:31:43.624
He was on the move.

01:31:43.833 --> 01:31:48.045
You heard him say that you said nothing
about a matinee jacket.

01:31:48.212 --> 01:31:50.756
It's quite possible he was...

01:31:50.923 --> 01:31:53.175
too far away to hear.

01:31:53.342 --> 01:31:55.803
What's so important
about this matinee jacket?

01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:58.764
It explains the lack of saliva
on the jump suit, Mary.

01:31:58.931 --> 01:32:01.474
You're missing the point.
If he can prove

01:32:01.475 --> 01:32:03.686
she's lying about
the matinee jacket,

01:32:03.853 --> 01:32:07.481
she could be lying about the rest.
If she's lying, she's guilty.

01:32:07.648 --> 01:32:09.775
There's none on the jump suit,

01:32:09.942 --> 01:32:15.614
so she's saying that the jacket
is missing cos it had the saliva on it.

01:32:16.615 --> 01:32:19.535
You told us yesterday, Mrs Chamberlain,

01:32:19.702 --> 01:32:21.996
that when you saw
the dingo shaking its head,

01:32:22.163 --> 01:32:25.124
it was halfway through the fly screen.

01:32:25.291 --> 01:32:28.335
It was on the move,
through the fly screen.

01:32:28.502 --> 01:32:31.630
Do you know there was no blood
found on the fly screen?

01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:35.509
I presume there hasn't been
cos it hasn't been mentioned.

01:32:35.718 --> 01:32:40.097
Do you say this dog had its head
half through the fly screen,

01:32:40.264 --> 01:32:42.975
shaking a bleeding baby?

01:32:43.142 --> 01:32:46.687
As I said again and again yesterday,

01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:50.441
it was emerging through the fly screen.

01:32:51.358 --> 01:32:54.153
Shaking its head vigorously?

01:32:55.196 --> 01:32:58.282
I couldn't tell you now
whether it was shaking its head

01:32:58.449 --> 01:33:01.660
as it was going through
or before it was through.

01:33:01.827 --> 01:33:06.874
Its obvious movement was shaking
the fly screen at some stage.

01:33:07.041 --> 01:33:09.375
It was a matter of from
the time I first saw

01:33:09.376 --> 01:33:11.503
it to when it was in
the back of the tent.

01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:15.716
It was a matter of a few seconds.
Very, very fast.

01:33:16.759 --> 01:33:17.968
And moving.

01:33:18.135 --> 01:33:23.682
What it had in its mouth, we now know,
according to you, was a bleeding baby?

01:33:25.768 --> 01:33:27.728
Well, that's my opinion.

01:33:27.895 --> 01:33:30.064
Pardon?

01:33:33.234 --> 01:33:35.027
That is my opinion.

01:33:35.194 --> 01:33:38.405
- Is there any doubt about it?
- Not in my mind.

01:33:39.448 --> 01:33:43.535
Is it merely your opinion
or something you know is a fact?

01:33:44.536 --> 01:33:47.164
Something my heart tells me is a fact.

01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:51.252
Other people don't think so.

01:33:53.045 --> 01:33:57.174
- Did the clean fly screen surprise you?
- No. There was some on the pole.

01:33:57.341 --> 01:34:00.386
It doesn't really surprise me
that there was none there.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:07.101
It would depend on the angle of the
animal or which angle the wounds were.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.024
Mrs Chamberlain, you say this child
was in the mouth of a dingo

01:34:14.191 --> 01:34:18.654
which was vigorously shaking its head
at the entrance to the tent.

01:34:18.862 --> 01:34:21.991
That is what you firmly believe.
Is that right?

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:23.450
That's right.

01:34:23.659 --> 01:34:26.370
The dog having taken Azeria
from the bassinet.

01:34:26.537 --> 01:34:31.125
- Azaria.
- Take it steady, Mrs Chamberlain.

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:33.502
You saw blood on the parka?

01:34:34.461 --> 01:34:35.920
Yes.

01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:37.714
Would you like a spell?

01:34:37.715 --> 01:34:40.884
I'd prefer to go on
with it, Your Honour.

01:34:41.051 --> 01:34:45.723
I don't want you to answer when you feel
distressed. Would you like a break?

01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:48.516
I'd prefer to go on.
It's been going on for

01:34:48.517 --> 01:34:51.103
two years and I'd like
to get it over with.

01:34:52.396 --> 01:34:56.900
You say the blood on the parka
must have come from the baby.

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:00.988
Yes.

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:03.824
When it was in the dog's mouth?

01:35:03.991 --> 01:35:05.951
Somewhere around that time.

01:35:06.118 --> 01:35:11.832
- What other time could it have come...
- Look, Mr Barker, I wasn't there.

01:35:11.999 --> 01:35:15.461
I can only go on
the evidence of my own eyes.

01:35:18.088 --> 01:35:21.300
We're talking about my baby daughter.

01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:24.970
Not some object!

01:35:30.351 --> 01:35:33.187
I know it's difficult,
but you must hold your temper.

01:35:33.354 --> 01:35:35.856
- You sound too harsh, too angry.
- I am angry.

01:35:36.023 --> 01:35:40.486
It's not going over well with the jury.
Try and be more demure.

01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:43.489
I am the way I am and the jury
will have to get used to it.

01:35:43.655 --> 01:35:48.035
Mrs Chamberlain, when this case is over,
I will get the hell out of here.

01:35:48.202 --> 01:35:51.080
You could stay here for
a fucking long time.

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:53.456
Don't talk to my wife like that.

01:35:53.457 --> 01:35:56.377
I'm told "Don't talk
like you usually talk".

01:35:56.543 --> 01:35:59.421
"Watch how you hold your mouth,
you look too sour."

01:35:59.588 --> 01:36:02.883
"Don't get angry.
Don't ask too many questions."

01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:05.552
"And never laugh
or you're an uncaring bitch."

01:36:05.719 --> 01:36:11.683
I can't cry to order and I won't be
squashed into a dumb act for the public.

01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:13.644
Or for you.

01:36:14.144 --> 01:36:20.067
Is it not the case that your husband
declined to search on that Sunday night

01:36:20.234 --> 01:36:22.403
because he knew the baby was dead?

01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:26.615
- And he knew you had killed her.
- Definitely not.

01:36:26.782 --> 01:36:31.703
You invented the story of the dingo
removing the baby from the tent.

01:36:35.499 --> 01:36:38.419
I did not invent that story, Mr Barker.

01:36:41.547 --> 01:36:43.549
It's the truth.

01:36:47.428 --> 01:36:53.600
The prosecutor put many questions to Mrs
Chamberlain when she was in the stand.

01:36:53.767 --> 01:36:57.395
But there was one
allegation, a most

01:36:57.396 --> 01:37:01.483
important allegation,
that was never put.

01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:04.778
It was the allegation
that would have started with the words:

01:37:04.945 --> 01:37:10.159
"Mrs Chamberlain, the reason
you cut your child's throat was..."

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:13.954
The most important allegation.

01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:16.957
And it was never put.

01:37:17.124 --> 01:37:20.085
It was never put because Mr Barker,

01:37:20.252 --> 01:37:22.671
one of the best men in the business,

01:37:22.838 --> 01:37:27.134
just cannot think of any reason
why she would do it.

01:37:29.136 --> 01:37:31.262
No doubt the ordinary
crocodile would have

01:37:31.263 --> 01:37:33.098
gone out of its way
to eat this baby.

01:37:33.265 --> 01:37:36.058
But our experience as
Australians tells us

01:37:36.059 --> 01:37:38.936
the dingo does not bear
such a reputation.

01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:42.316
Now, what is this dingo
supposed to have done?

01:37:42.483 --> 01:37:47.863
It managed, if her story is true,
to kill the baby in the bassinet,

01:37:48.071 --> 01:37:52.784
drag it from the basket, shake her head
vigorously at the entrance to the tent,

01:37:52.951 --> 01:37:56.705
then carry her off in such a way
that left virtually no clues in the tent

01:37:56.872 --> 01:37:59.666
in the way of blood or hairs
or anything else.

01:37:59.833 --> 01:38:03.545
It left no blood or drag marks
at the entrance to the tent.

01:38:03.712 --> 01:38:07.007
It was able to pass by
the child's mother, in full view,

01:38:07.174 --> 01:38:10.802
without disclosing or revealing
it was carrying a baby.

01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:14.264
It managed to kill the child,
with the jump suit all buttoned up.

01:38:14.515 --> 01:38:17.016
If you accept Professor
Cameron, it buried

01:38:17.017 --> 01:38:19.353
the body, having
undone one top button.

01:38:21.271 --> 01:38:23.398
So, all in all, ladies and gentlemen,

01:38:23.565 --> 01:38:28.111
it was not only a dextrous dingo,
it was a very tidy dingo.

01:38:32.199 --> 01:38:36.703
There is some common ground between
Mr Phillips and the prosecution.

01:38:36.912 --> 01:38:41.208
That is that this is
a case of simple alternatives.

01:38:41.375 --> 01:38:43.794
Either a dingo killed that child

01:38:44.002 --> 01:38:46.046
or she was murdered.

01:38:46.213 --> 01:38:49.049
A dingo or murder.

01:38:50.175 --> 01:38:55.347
Mr Barker shifted the onus of proof
from the prosecution to the defence

01:38:55.514 --> 01:39:00.102
by shifting the emphasis from the almost
incomprehensible forensic evidence,

01:39:00.352 --> 01:39:02.729
claiming it was a case
of simple alternatives.

01:39:02.896 --> 01:39:07.067
He also claimed the matinee jacket
was a fabrication by Lindy Chamberlain.

01:39:07.693 --> 01:39:12.906
Mate, that Barker bloke's
as cunning as a shithouse rat.

01:39:13.073 --> 01:39:14.408
Beauty, eh?

01:39:15.534 --> 01:39:17.703
Two: One against for a hung jury.

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:20.956
Shh!

01:39:23.792 --> 01:39:28.755
If ever there was a time when dingoes
were a problem at Ayers Rock,

01:39:28.922 --> 01:39:31.341
it was in August 1980.

01:39:31.508 --> 01:39:34.553
I ask you, and you'll bear this in mind,

01:39:34.761 --> 01:39:38.473
if your wife had murdered
your child in that car,

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.518
what would you have done
over the ensuing months?

01:39:41.685 --> 01:39:46.440
Would you still have the car?
Would it have been thoroughly scrubbed?

01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:51.945
Would the scissors still be left
in the car? Matters such as that.

01:39:52.404 --> 01:39:55.407
If Mrs Lowe heard that cry,

01:39:56.116 --> 01:40:01.538
you may think the only inference you can
draw is that it was Azaria's last cry.

01:40:01.705 --> 01:40:04.374
That Azaria was still living.

01:40:04.541 --> 01:40:10.005
She was not and could not
have been lying dead in the car.

01:40:12.799 --> 01:40:17.679
I don't like the way the jury went out.
They wouldn't look at me.

01:40:17.846 --> 01:40:21.892
- The judge summed up in our favour.
- He almost instructed for an acquittal.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.934
We're home and hosed, mate.

01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:27.356
Do you believe a dingo
would take a baby? Yes or no?

01:40:27.522 --> 01:40:29.691
- No.
- What did Mr Harris say about it?

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:32.903
Anyone for a cup of tea?

01:40:34.613 --> 01:40:37.365
Can we sort out the
blood thing first?

01:40:37.366 --> 01:40:39.993
Forget it. None of
us understands it.

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:44.581
The best thing for us is
if she's found guilty!

01:40:44.748 --> 01:40:46.541
You're a bastard, Mark!

01:40:54.716 --> 01:40:57.219
Why are they taking so long?

01:41:02.224 --> 01:41:04.226
Michael.

01:41:05.268 --> 01:41:07.270
If I go in...

01:41:08.897 --> 01:41:11.650
..I think
we should get a divorce.

01:41:13.985 --> 01:41:16.613
Nonsense.
I won't dignify that by discussing it.

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:19.532
You couldn't handle
things on your own.

01:41:19.533 --> 01:41:20.534
Rubbish.

01:41:38.427 --> 01:41:42.431
Mr Foreman,
if you'll be good enough to stand.

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:46.059
Mr Foreman,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:41:46.226 --> 01:41:49.855
are you unanimously agreed
upon your verdict?

01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:51.481
We are.

01:41:51.648 --> 01:41:54.525
Do you find the accused,
Alice Lynne Chamberlain,

01:41:54.526 --> 01:41:57.571
guilty or not guilty of murder?

01:41:58.822 --> 01:42:00.031
Guilty.

01:42:03.201 --> 01:42:05.120
- Is that the verdict of you all?
- Yes.

01:42:05.287 --> 01:42:07.539
Bastards!

01:42:09.249 --> 01:42:12.252
Thank you, Mr Foreman.
You may sit down.

01:42:17.382 --> 01:42:23.096
Alice Lynne Chamberlain,
you have been found guilty of murder.

01:42:23.263 --> 01:42:26.016
There is only one sentence
I can pass on you,

01:42:26.183 --> 01:42:29.978
that you be imprisoned,
with hard labour, for life.

01:42:37.736 --> 01:42:40.197
Guilty!

01:42:41.698 --> 01:42:44.910
- What's life in this town?
- For ever.

01:42:48.747 --> 01:42:51.208
Watch him, he's going to fall.

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:10.560
- Do you believe I'm innocent? Do you?
- Yes, Michael. I do.

01:43:10.727 --> 01:43:14.689
- Then how can they do this to us?
- They don't know you.

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:34.209
The prison car has arrived.

01:43:34.376 --> 01:43:36.378
Mrs Chamberlain.

01:43:42.259 --> 01:43:44.678
This is ridiculous.

01:43:44.886 --> 01:43:46.888
It's ridiculous.

01:43:49.641 --> 01:43:51.643
I love you.

01:43:52.936 --> 01:43:54.938
I can't be without you.

01:43:55.105 --> 01:43:59.192
You're gonna have to now, love.
And the boys need you.

01:44:22.424 --> 01:44:24.426
The dingo was innocent!

01:44:35.061 --> 01:44:38.230
In a sensational conclusion
to the most talked-about case

01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:40.233
in Australian legal history,

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.028
Alice Lynne Chamberlain
was today found guilty

01:44:43.194 --> 01:44:45.155
of the murder of her daughter Azaria,

01:44:45.322 --> 01:44:48.450
and sentenced to life imprisonment
with hard labour.

01:44:48.617 --> 01:44:52.579
Her husband Michael was found guilty
of being an accessory to the murder.

01:44:52.746 --> 01:44:55.582
Sentencing for Mr Chamberlain
was postponed

01:44:55.749 --> 01:44:58.293
until court resumes tomorrow am.

01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:00.670
Gran, what's going on?

01:45:26.446 --> 01:45:32.077
Chief Justice Muirhead sentenced Michael
Chamberlain to 18 months in prison

01:45:32.243 --> 01:45:35.705
after he'd been found guilty
of being an accessory to murder.

01:45:36.331 --> 01:45:39.334
The judge suspended
Michael's 18-month sentence

01:45:39.501 --> 01:45:42.796
in, he said, the interests
of the motherless boys.

01:45:42.963 --> 01:45:46.549
Placing Mr Chamberlain
on a three-year bond...

01:45:46.716 --> 01:45:50.804
What about the fuckin' mother?
Kids need their mothers.

01:45:51.972 --> 01:45:54.140
Daddy! Daddy!

01:45:57.143 --> 01:46:00.939
The government has again refused
Lindy Chamberlain's appeal

01:46:01.106 --> 01:46:04.776
to keep her baby with her
after the birth in Berrimah prison

01:46:04.943 --> 01:46:10.240
where she is serving a life sentence
for the murder of her daughter Azaria.

01:46:10.949 --> 01:46:14.119
That's it. One more push.

01:46:14.285 --> 01:46:17.080
One more. Good. Good.

01:46:19.165 --> 01:46:21.167
Good girl.

01:46:25.296 --> 01:46:27.882
- It's a girl.
- Good girl.

01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:31.052
It's a girl.

01:46:36.599 --> 01:46:38.727
- It's a girl.
- Can we get a picture?

01:46:38.893 --> 01:46:42.313
Here we go, Mrs Chamberlain.
She's yours to hold for one hour.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.482
That's all, I'm afraid.

01:46:56.036 --> 01:46:59.080
You have to put your hand
under her neck, like this.

01:46:59.247 --> 01:47:01.249
All right, mate. I know.

01:47:04.627 --> 01:47:07.839
Reagan. Bring us a towel, there's a boy.

01:47:09.924 --> 01:47:12.761
Come on, mate. I'm not
very good at this.

01:47:29.944 --> 01:47:33.740
Lindy and Michael Chamberlain
lost their high court appeal today

01:47:33.907 --> 01:47:35.825
on a vote of three to two,

01:47:36.034 --> 01:47:39.204
ending over two years
of legal and political battles.

01:47:39.370 --> 01:47:45.168
I am bitterly disappointed
at the decision that's been made today.

01:47:45.835 --> 01:47:49.297
I'd like to affirm that
Lindy and I are innocent people,

01:47:49.464 --> 01:47:54.427
and that we will not stop fighting
until our names are clear.

01:47:55.678 --> 01:47:58.807
I'd like to thank
those members of the public...

01:47:58.973 --> 01:48:01.601
Jeez, talk about flogging a dead horse.

01:48:02.769 --> 01:48:07.440
Finally, this case isn't over...

01:48:14.072 --> 01:48:16.074
Mummy! Mummy!

01:48:16.616 --> 01:48:18.993
- There she is!
- Mummy!

01:48:19.202 --> 01:48:21.286
- There's your mummy.
- There's Mummy.

01:48:21.287 --> 01:48:23.957
Wave to Mummy.
Let Mummy have a look at you.

01:48:25.708 --> 01:48:27.710
Kahlia, there's Mummy!

01:48:27.919 --> 01:48:30.380
- There's Mummy.
- Mamma.

01:48:32.382 --> 01:48:33.424
That's your mummy.

01:48:33.591 --> 01:48:37.512
Why do you believe there is such
a surge of support for the Chamberlains,

01:48:37.679 --> 01:48:41.182
despite the constant
legal affirmation of their guilt?

01:48:41.349 --> 01:48:44.394
Legal processes have prevented
the previous submission

01:48:44.561 --> 01:48:46.813
of much of the evidence we now present.

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.983
For example, it proves
that the reagent used

01:48:50.150 --> 01:48:53.653
to detect the presence of foetal
blood, in the car and on the bag,

01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.864
was not suitable for the purpose.

01:48:56.030 --> 01:49:00.034
That's supported in writing by the West
German manufacturers of the reagent.

01:49:00.201 --> 01:49:04.330
As for the spray pattern found under
the dashboard, the "arterial spray",

01:49:04.539 --> 01:49:08.543
we've discovered the same pattern
in 11 other similar model Toranas.

01:49:08.710 --> 01:49:10.295
The substance isn't blood.

01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:13.715
It's believed to be sound-deadeners
applied in manufacture.

01:49:13.882 --> 01:49:16.968
As regards the dingoes,
further examination has shown...

01:49:17.135 --> 01:49:20.929
The arterial spray was the same spray
they had on 11 other models!

01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:25.310
Stop! We're not having another
dinner party ruined by those people.

01:49:25.476 --> 01:49:29.314
I don't care what new evidence
you've got. She's guilty.

01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:44.579
He must have fallen from up there.

01:49:44.746 --> 01:49:46.956
Stupid bastard, trying
to climb that side.

01:49:47.123 --> 01:49:49.792
Jeez, the dingoes have had a go.

01:49:54.005 --> 01:49:56.007
Hey, look!

01:50:04.265 --> 01:50:09.270
Five and a half years after the
disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain,

01:50:09.437 --> 01:50:14.484
- police have found what is believed...
- Lindy, come and look.

01:50:15.193 --> 01:50:17.904
The jacket was found
during a search of the area

01:50:18.112 --> 01:50:21.282
where the body of a fallen climber
was discovered by a tourist.

01:50:21.449 --> 01:50:24.409
The body was found
hundred-fifty metres from the spot

01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:27.664
where Azaria's jump suit
was found in 1980.

01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:32.043
From Ayers Rock,
police have found an article of clothing

01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:35.213
which may be connected with
the Azaria Chamberlain case.

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:37.757
There is a possibility
it is the matinee jacket

01:50:37.966 --> 01:50:44.180
Lindy claimed Azaria was wearing on the
night of her death over five years ago.

01:50:44.347 --> 01:50:46.014
The find is considered by the

01:50:46.015 --> 01:50:48.601
Chamberlains' attorney
to be significant.

01:50:48.768 --> 01:50:52.730
The absence of the matinee jacket
was crucial in Lindy's conviction.

01:50:52.939 --> 01:50:57.192
The situation with the jacket is that
tests will be carried out in Melbourne,

01:50:57.193 --> 01:50:59.487
to determine if it is the same jacket

01:50:59.654 --> 01:51:03.324
Mrs Chamberlain claimed
her daughter was wearing.

01:51:04.242 --> 01:51:08.579
Why has Mrs Chamberlain been released
before any tests have been conducted?

01:51:08.746 --> 01:51:11.498
The jacket's discovery
has no bearing on

01:51:11.499 --> 01:51:14.210
my decision to release
Mrs Chamberlain.

01:51:15.712 --> 01:51:20.591
- What is your decision based on?
- It has been on compassionate grounds.

01:51:24.595 --> 01:51:27.265
Here she comes! Here she comes!

01:51:34.856 --> 01:51:37.066
Oh, look. We're here.

01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.696
Oh, Michael, look at the ribbons!

01:51:44.115 --> 01:51:46.117
Mum!

01:51:52.123 --> 01:51:54.584
Mum! Welcome home, Mum.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:01.507
Are you really here for good, Mum?

01:52:03.259 --> 01:52:05.261
For good and ever, love.

01:52:07.513 --> 01:52:09.474
For good and ever.

01:52:14.729 --> 01:52:15.730
Thank you.

01:52:20.943 --> 01:52:23.321
Oh, look at this!

01:52:23.488 --> 01:52:25.490
Oh, how beautiful!

01:52:26.407 --> 01:52:28.409
Look at the flowers.

01:52:29.869 --> 01:52:31.621
Where's Reagan and Kahlia?

01:52:31.788 --> 01:52:34.832
They're supposed to be here.
Jan was looking after them.

01:52:34.999 --> 01:52:37.710
Take me a while to get this organised.

01:52:37.877 --> 01:52:39.879
I'll never find anything.

01:52:40.046 --> 01:52:43.466
Not too soon.
You might get culture shock.

01:52:43.633 --> 01:52:45.802
Mummy! Mummy!

01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.055
Oh, Reagan. Oh, darling.

01:52:52.392 --> 01:52:54.727
Hello, Kahlia.

01:52:54.894 --> 01:52:58.648
Hello, darling. Don't you look lovely?

01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:04.695
- Such a pretty dress.
- Mummy made it in jail.

01:53:08.783 --> 01:53:10.910
This is Mummy, darling. She's back.

01:53:11.119 --> 01:53:13.079
Real mummy?

01:53:13.996 --> 01:53:16.374
Real mummy.

01:53:16.541 --> 01:53:19.210
Why don't you give her
a big hug and a kiss?

01:53:24.507 --> 01:53:27.176
That's all right.

01:53:27.343 --> 01:53:31.848
We've got plenty of time for that.
Plenty of time for that.

01:53:34.517 --> 01:53:39.021
Today we can rejoice with the family
as we welcome Lindy home.

01:54:01.419 --> 01:54:07.091
Words are totally inadequate
to say how we feel,

01:54:07.258 --> 01:54:12.555
to express our gratitude for your love
and your care and your prayers.

01:54:15.224 --> 01:54:19.604
It reaches out to us like a blanket.
It surrounds us.

01:54:19.770 --> 01:54:22.190
It's totally tangible.

01:54:24.275 --> 01:54:27.695
The fight for justice
has only just started.

01:54:27.862 --> 01:54:32.033
You may think it's over, but,
believe me, it's only just beginning.

01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:37.788
It's not only for us,
for our freedom and to clear our name.

01:54:37.955 --> 01:54:40.832
But it's for all Australians.

01:54:40.833 --> 01:54:44.670
We never wanna see
this happen in Australia again.

01:54:45.379 --> 01:54:47.882
God bless you all and be with you.

01:55:09.904 --> 01:55:15.576
Praise God from whom
all blessings flow

01:55:15.868 --> 01:55:22.124
Praise him all creatures here below

01:55:22.291 --> 01:55:28.506
Praise him above in heavenly host

01:55:28.714 --> 01:55:35.680
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost

01:55:35.846 --> 01:55:36.846
Amen

01:55:48.985 --> 01:55:54.824
Michael, now that Lindy's out of jail,
why are you still fighting?

01:55:54.991 --> 01:55:57.660
I don't think
a lot of people realise

01:55:57.827 --> 01:56:02.456
how important innocence
is to innocent people.

01:56:13.926 --> 01:56:16.220
September 15 1988

01:56:16.387 --> 01:56:22.643
Eight years after
the disappearance of baby Azaria,

01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:29.810
Lindy and Michael Chamberlain finally
won the fight to prove their innocence.

01:56:32.278 --> 01:56:39.278
All three judges of
the Northern Territory Court of Appeals

01:56:39.452 --> 01:56:44.707
exonerated the Chamberlains
of all charges.

01:56:44.874 --> 01:56:50.129
The fight to restore
their lives continues.
