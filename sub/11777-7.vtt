08:41.145 --> 08:42.104
You used a lot
of different techniques

08:42.188 --> 08:43.188
with masking and spray paint.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.440
Even though I like it a lot,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.525
there's not strong color theory
in this.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.611
There's not a whole lot
of real thought process

08:48.694 --> 08:49.695
on the contrast of it.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.156
Sebastian.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.368
You didn't really use
a huge color palette here.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.286
It's a bit dark.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.287
Got the little bit of yellow
in there popping out,

08:58.371 --> 09:00.331
but from a distance, this thing,

09:00.414 --> 09:02.291
just really hard to read
what it is.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.794
Tatu Baby.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.879
It's got a lot
of your personality in it.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.297
You made this
like a <i> Chola</i> from space.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.716
That's just
kind of a cool approach.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.760
The green, the purple,
the yellow on the top,

09:12.843 --> 09:13.719
the contrast
is all in the colors.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.472
From a distance,
this thing looks intense.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.641
And it just makes it
overall interesting.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.185
What's up, Mark?

09:21.269 --> 09:22.144
Tell us about your approach
to this.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.813
A real aggressive,
battle-worn helmet.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.607
It does have a graphic look
to it from a distance.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.317
A little bit sloppy in areas.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.487
I don't feel like you
really created much contrast.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.322
{\an8}Mark's been talking
a really big game,

09:33.406 --> 09:34.240
{\an8}but I don't see him
back that talk up.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.826
He really needs to bring it.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.287
Mr. Kutta.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.830
It's another one
of those helmets

09:40.913 --> 09:42.957
that looks like
just another cool helmet.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.792
You have yellow and orange
going through the red,

09:44.875 --> 09:46.502
which are all the same part
of the color wheel.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.586
You did not hit
much contrast there.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.589
Clint.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.632
I decided to take
two epic scenes.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.551
I went from kind of a dark
to a lighter side

09:53.634 --> 09:56.387
and then worked certain colors
warm to cool.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.432
The ultimate definition
of contrast.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.058
The way the green transitions
into the explosions

10:01.142 --> 10:02.935
on the purple.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.603
You did it
not only artistically,

10:04.687 --> 10:06.272
but you did it
from scene to scene.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.356
Very cool, man.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.358
You definitely did
a great job out here today.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.570
All right, boys,
use of contrast.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.738
Start out with Clint.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.865
He not only showed contrast
in his artwork,

10:15.948 --> 10:17.867
but he showed contrast
from the movie,

10:17.950 --> 10:18.951
from the environments.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.578
{\an5}-Clint really shined.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.578
-What about Sarah?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.621
The colors bounce.
She showed contrast.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.414
The two lightsaber things
are pretty weak

10:23.497 --> 10:25.374
for that side of the helmet.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.917
{\an5}-That kind of bummed me out.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.917
-Jesse.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.044
He did do his usual stuff,

10:28.127 --> 10:28.878
but Jesse knows
how to paint, man.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.047
He layered multi-colors
to create

10:31.130 --> 10:32.048
nice depth and contrast.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.799
Technique-wise,
he did a really good job.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.385
Jamie, putting that
light green against a yellow.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.721
{\an5}-That thing was just flat.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.721
-We also have Sebastian.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.765
Limited palette,
reds and blacks.

10:40.848 --> 10:41.724
A wide, varying range of colors

10:41.807 --> 10:44.143
is how you're gonna build
that contrast,

10:44.226 --> 10:46.062
not all a bunch
of dark, muted tones.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.313
Not much to debate here.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.939
Cool, man.
Well, let's let 'em know.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.318
For this Flash Challenge,
we were testing contrast.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.363
Some of you did amazing work.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.407
Sarah, your use
of the imagery from the film

10:58.491 --> 11:01.577
and your choice of colors
was really spot-on.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.955
Clint, you showed contrast
by linking not only the stories,

11:05.039 --> 11:06.749
but you actually did it
with the way you used

11:06.832 --> 11:07.750
your color palette.

11:07.833 --> 11:08.834
Your helmet really pops.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.419
Thanks.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.630
Jesse, great use
of the technique,

11:12.713 --> 11:14.757
building some contrast
out of the dark and light,

11:14.840 --> 11:16.384
and bringing your design
to life.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.301
Thank you.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.387
The judges have decided.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.013
The winner
of the Flash Challenge...

11:21.097 --> 11:24.141
[suspenseful music]

11:25.976 --> 11:26.602
Is Clint.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.854
{\an5}-[laughs]

11:26.685 --> 11:28.854
-[applause]

11:30.856 --> 11:32.358
{\an8}Clint!

11:32.441 --> 11:34.652
{\an8}You ass[bleep]!

11:34.735 --> 11:36.946
{\an8}W-What?
Oh, that's a heart breaking.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.406
{\an8}[laughs] Ohh.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.490
{\an8}Ain't that a bitch?

11:39.573 --> 11:41.117
Congratulations, Clint.

11:41.200 --> 11:41.951
You now have the power to assign

11:42.034 --> 11:44.578
all the human canvases
once again

11:44.662 --> 11:46.122
for the elimination tattoo.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.415
I'm still in this bitch.

11:47.498 --> 11:48.290
And all the little pawns,
they're gonna go home soon.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.292
Head back to the shop

11:50.376 --> 11:51.794
and get ready
to meet your canvases

11:51.877 --> 11:53.921
for the next elimination tattoo.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.301
{\an8}Your style was just a
few levels above street level.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.719
{\an8}You can say
whatever the [bleep] you want,

12:00.803 --> 12:01.470
{\an8}because your opinion
means [bleep] to me.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.807
{\an5}-Sarah?

12:01.554 --> 12:04.807
-Just take her down.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.600
I'm gunning for everybody.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.726
{\an5}-Jamie.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.726
-Clint.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.644
{\an5}-[bleep] Me.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.644
-[laughs]

12:10.729 --> 12:13.274
[music]

12:15.609 --> 12:17.361
I'm--I'm a little
disappointed, you know.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.781
It's just another thing where,
like, I've given, like, 150%.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.450
I did it really, really well.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.909
I executed it
to the best of my abilities,

12:23.993 --> 12:26.787
but yet again,
they don't pick my stuff.

12:28.706 --> 12:32.626
Sarah does a lot of barking.
[barking]

12:32.710 --> 12:35.004
Just barking for no reason,
instead of just shutting up

12:35.087 --> 12:36.672
and focusing
on what she needs to do.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.008
How bad do you think
we're supposed to feel for you?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.509
You got a nod
for doing a good job,

12:40.593 --> 12:41.677
and everybody else
didn't get [bleep].

12:41.760 --> 12:44.513
{\an5}-We didn't win either, okay?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.513
-[laughs]

12:44.597 --> 12:44.847
Go complain to Clint.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.018
If I've done myself
any favors right now,

12:49.101 --> 12:50.394
it's winning this one.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.688
The main thing, though,
is not [bleep] it up for myself,

12:52.771 --> 12:54.148
'cause that's what I did
the first time.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.858
So I need to decide
on which piece

12:55.941 --> 12:57.234
is gonna make me look the best.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.028
And the second thing
is just tying the noose

12:59.111 --> 13:00.362
on some of these necks
around here.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.490
I mean, obviously Mark and Kay
are gonna be on my list.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.741
Don't you think that they're

13:03.824 --> 13:05.534
just gonna take care
of themselves?

13:05.618 --> 13:06.452
We've been thinking that.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.204
You know what strategy
I would go with?

13:08.287 --> 13:10.664
Find somebody who you think's
within your place,

13:10.748 --> 13:12.166
and try to get them down.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.376
Well, yeah, that's--
that's Sarah.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.794
{\an5}-Sarah?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.794
-Without a doubt.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.088
{\an5}-Just take her down.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.088
-That's what I'm saying.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.965
If you're running
from [bleep] sharks,

13:20.049 --> 13:23.260
I'd be throwing as many people
behind me as possible.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.554
{\an8}I know for a fact
that I'm up there with Sarah.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.847
So I hope she goes home.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.727
[ominous music]

13:33.979 --> 13:35.231

{\an8}[tattoo gun buzzing]

13:40.152 --> 13:42.029
[tense music]

13:44.990 --> 13:46.700
Welcome to
the elimination tattoo.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.161
This week,
we're testing contrast.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.206
You'll be judged by Oliver peck,
Chris Nunez, and myself.

13:52.289 --> 13:55.834
And don't forget, you'll also be
judged by America.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.378
Each week,
viewers at home will vote

13:57.461 --> 13:58.879
for the tattoo
that they think is the best,

13:58.963 --> 14:00.714
using the same criteria
that the judges use.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.425
This week's
elimination tattoo...

14:03.509 --> 14:04.510
<i>Star Wars</i>

14:04.593 --> 14:07.513
[groan] Oh, [bleep].

14:07.596 --> 14:08.806
That is amazing.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.599
{\an5}-Oh, [bleep].

14:08.889 --> 14:10.599
-I told you.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.809
{\an5}-[bleep] Yeah.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.809
-[Laughing]

14:11.892 --> 14:14.687
{\an8}This is gonna be literally
the first <i> Star Wars</i> tattoo

14:14.770 --> 14:16.105
{\an8}I've ever done in my life.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.857
It's estimated
that over 1 billion people

14:18.941 --> 14:21.944
have seen <i> Star Wars</i>
in theaters since 1977.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.405
<i>Star Wars</i> fans are known
for their devotion.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.447
Today these fans
want to express it

14:25.531 --> 14:28.200
on their skin forever.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.702
So let's meet your canvases.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.663
[music]

14:33.998 --> 14:36.000
Clint, because you won
the Flash Challenge,

14:36.083 --> 14:40.212
you now have the power to assign
all human canvases.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.047
Choose wisely.

14:42.131 --> 14:42.840
<i>The one thing</i>
<i>about these canvas selections</i>

14:42.923 --> 14:45.009
<i>is that it screws up strategy.</i>

14:45.092 --> 14:46.802
{\an8}They're getting talked
out of that [bleep],

14:46.885 --> 14:47.970
{\an8}and that shouldn't happen.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.722
We have had
a couple problems with

14:49.805 --> 14:51.390
the last time
that we did these canvases.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.641
So let me start off
by telling you

14:52.725 --> 14:54.351
that my name is Clint Cummings,

14:54.435 --> 14:56.186
and I'm pretty damn good
at what I do.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.229
And I can prove this to you,

14:57.313 --> 14:59.148
because I am standing up here
talking to you

14:59.231 --> 15:00.399
while these chumps
are sitting down.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.986
{\an8}Clint must think
he's on his way out.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.362
<i>He's trying to get</i>
<i>as much attention as possible</i>

15:05.446 --> 15:07.406
by acting a fool.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.532
You're gonna tell me
what you want,

15:08.616 --> 15:09.491
where you want it,
how you want it,

15:09.575 --> 15:11.243
and you're not gonna change
your mind.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.120
These guys over here,
they'll tell you how they think

15:13.203 --> 15:14.455
it'll be better somewhere else.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.248
Don't do that. They're good.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.666
They can do the tattoo
that you want,

15:17.750 --> 15:19.293
where you want it,
how you want it.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.128
All right, chief.
What are you looking to get?

15:21.211 --> 15:22.963
A Clone Trooper
on my right thigh.

15:23.047 --> 15:23.922
Yeah? How 'bout you, my friend?

15:24.006 --> 15:25.591
I want to get Chewbacca
on my right calf.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.344
Ooh. What about you, sweetheart?

15:28.427 --> 15:31.013
I want to get Yoda
up my left thigh.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.598
I want R2-D2 and C-3PO
on my thigh.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.891
She's only getting one of 'em.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.851
{\an5}-[bleep] Right.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.851
-What about you, chief?

15:35.934 --> 15:38.937
I want a royal guard
on my left thigh.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.439
{\an5}-Longest you've sat for?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.439
-Only two hours.

15:40.522 --> 15:41.690
I've only had
one other piece done.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.442
[chuckles wickedly]

15:43.525 --> 15:44.860
I like you.

15:44.943 --> 15:46.570
{\an8}I'm gunning for everybody.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.864
<i>Mark and Kay</i>
<i>are hanging on by a thread,</i>

15:48.947 --> 15:51.325
so I'm not gonna help
them out any.

15:51.408 --> 15:52.826
Sarah's always had a problem
with contrast.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.329
I can give her something
that's gonna require

15:55.412 --> 15:57.539
so much damn contrast,
if she drops the ball,

15:57.623 --> 15:59.500
that's gonna put her here,
and that's gonna put me here.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.876
<i>You have to be very careful.</i>

16:00.959 --> 16:03.045
<i>If you give a heavy hitter</i>

16:03.128 --> 16:04.463
{\an8}something that will
challenge them,

16:04.546 --> 16:07.091
it can force them into being
a lot harsher an opponent.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.092
<i>Sebastian's problem is</i>

16:08.175 --> 16:10.552
{\an8}he's a guy that sees
stuff and replicates.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.554
<i>I need to give him something</i>
<i>that's gonna require</i>

16:12.638 --> 16:13.055
<i>a little bit</i>
<i>of artistic ability.</i>

16:14.348 --> 16:15.182
Got him.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.060
Canvases, one by one,
please reveal

16:18.143 --> 16:20.062
the name on the bottom
of your skull.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.271
Sarah.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.399
{\an8}I got a very difficult tattoo.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.900
<i>The hardest ones</i>
<i>were the Stormtroopers.</i>

16:24.983 --> 16:28.320
There's only so much
you can do with white.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.655
Clint.

16:29.738 --> 16:30.531
Jesse.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.573
Jamie.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.158
{\an5}-Clint

16:31.657 --> 16:33.158
-[bleep] Me.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.326
{\an8}Gives me the [bleep] Chewbacca.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.080
He's completely covered in fur,
and it's black and gray.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.915
Odds are stacked against me
on this one.

16:39.998 --> 16:40.874
Mark.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.418
Kay Kutta.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.961
Sebastian.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.337
Steve.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.839
Tatu Baby.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.175
{\an8}The character that I do know
is the little green guy.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.260
Thank you, Clint.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.428
You have the rest of the evening

16:52.511 --> 16:54.054
to consult
with your human canvas.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.098
Tomorrow you'll have five hours

16:56.181 --> 16:58.100
to complete
your <i> Star Wars</i> tattoo.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.977
Use your Jedi powers wisely,

17:00.060 --> 17:02.271
and you'll be closer
to 100 grand,

17:02.354 --> 17:03.689
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

17:03.772 --> 17:05.941
and the title of Ink Master.

17:06.023 --> 17:06.942
However, cross to the dark side,

17:07.025 --> 17:09.903
and you'll be packing
your machines

17:09.987 --> 17:10.612
and heading home.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.656
May the force be with you.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.742
<i>We're looking</i>
<i>for the artist to use</i>

17:15.826 --> 17:16.577
{\an8}a high amount of contrast

17:16.660 --> 17:19.204
<i>to really create depth</i>

17:19.288 --> 17:21.373
<i>and color palettes</i>
<i>that bounce off of each other</i>

17:21.457 --> 17:23.291
to make these characters
come to life.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.792
Give me an idea.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.128
Um, I want to have
the Imperial Cog...

17:27.212 --> 17:28.088
{\an5}-Yes.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.088
-In the background,

17:28.172 --> 17:29.256
just as kind of a silhouette,

17:29.339 --> 17:30.799
and then just a Clone Trooper.

17:30.883 --> 17:31.967
That background
is really simplistic,

17:32.050 --> 17:34.261
and this whole challenge
is about contrast.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.679
{\an8}In order to show contrast,

17:35.763 --> 17:37.514
{\an8}like, I'm really gonna
have to play with this.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.226
Would you be open to me changing
up the background a little bit?

17:41.310 --> 17:42.478
What kind of background
are you looking for?

17:42.561 --> 17:43.896
I'm thinking, like, a galaxy...

17:43.979 --> 17:46.023
{\an5}-Mm...

17:43.979 --> 17:46.023
-With the other half being--

17:46.106 --> 17:47.983
Nah, I'd rather just keep
the focus

17:48.067 --> 17:49.693
on just the Clone Trooper.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.028
I don't think that's going
to fulfill this challenge.

17:51.111 --> 17:51.862
I don't want to go home for it.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.697
<i>We're totally butting heads.</i>

17:53.781 --> 17:55.949
<i>I need to convince him</i>

17:56.033 --> 17:58.327
to go in the direction
that I really wanna go.

17:59.119 --> 18:03.373
So C-3PO and R2-D2.
Have a seat.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.502
<i>Doing two full-body</i>
<i>characters in five hours</i>

18:06.585 --> 18:07.920
{\an8}is gonna be really difficult.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.671
{\an5}-Which one do you want more?

18:08.003 --> 18:09.671
-I kind of want both.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.840
{\an5}-Both?

18:09.755 --> 18:11.840
-Yeah.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.342
The only thing is,
we only got five hours, so...

18:13.425 --> 18:14.301
{\an5}-Okay.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.301
-Realistically, what we need

18:14.384 --> 18:16.678
to do is we need to focus
on one of them.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.514
I would say
either a head of C-3PO,

18:18.597 --> 18:21.558
or we could probably try to do
the whole R2-D2.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.519
I'm really trying to push her
towards C-3PO

18:23.602 --> 18:25.354
because I feel like that
that one's the one

18:25.437 --> 18:27.356
where I can really show
the most contrast.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.360
I don't know if I want, like,
a floating head on my leg.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.569
{\an5}-I hear ya.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.569
-[laughs]

18:32.653 --> 18:35.239
Unfortunately, would you
prefer a floating head,

18:35.322 --> 18:37.449
or would you prefer a tattoo
that's not finished?

18:37.533 --> 18:38.909
And don't listen to anything
Clint says.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.202
Clint's just trying to throw us
under the bus.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.078
<i>It looks like Clint's strategy</i>

18:41.161 --> 18:44.039
is definitely working
against me.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.502
Was there a particular
battle scene

18:48.585 --> 18:49.169
that you were thinking?

18:49.253 --> 18:52.089
{\an5}-Not particular.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.089
-What?

18:52.172 --> 18:55.217
{\an8}My canvas wants a battle
with a Star Destroyer.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.718
Holy [bleep].

18:56.802 --> 18:57.886
There's no contrast in that.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.264
The mother[bleep] looks flat.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.474
I need something
to contrast that.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.351
<i>We need to bump up</i>
<i>the dynamics in this</i>

19:04.434 --> 19:05.936
to get a really good effect
out of it.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.605
<i>Otherwise, I might be</i>
<i>in trouble.</i>

19:08.689 --> 19:10.357
Imperial guard.
Click on that one.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.569
That's the most realistic
picture that they have online.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.736
The rest are like--

19:14.820 --> 19:16.238
Okay, so everything
is red on him.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.657
{\an8}Let me tell you the [bleep]
things about my character.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.741
It's all red.
No contrast there.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.910
What I'm gonna do is

19:21.994 --> 19:23.787
I'm gonna get the top part
of him, probably a sword,

19:23.871 --> 19:26.415
uh, make a light source
so I can have a, uh,

19:26.498 --> 19:28.917
like, a contrasting color
bouncing off the red,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.378
and a space backdrop.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.963
<i>I have to do things</i>
<i>in the background.</i>

19:33.046 --> 19:34.423
<i>I have to do</i>
<i>all this color [bleep].</i>

19:34.506 --> 19:37.426
And this dude only sat for
two hours before in his past.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.927
Sure you gonna be able
to handle this pain

19:39.011 --> 19:40.053
on your thigh, man?

19:40.137 --> 19:43.098
This is something that you give
one of the top dogs.

19:43.182 --> 19:43.348
I'm [bleep].

19:45.601 --> 19:48.270
[music]

19:49.354 --> 19:52.357
I think I have been doing
really good pieces,

19:52.441 --> 19:55.277
but it doesn't matter what I do.
It's never gonna get picked.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.737
They don't recognize [bleep].

19:56.820 --> 19:58.614
Well, I don't understand why
she's whining all the time.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.698
It's time to go home.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.617
My style is more different
than anybody here.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.578
Like with my clown girls
and my low-riders,

20:04.661 --> 20:06.872
it is street style,
just more professional.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.457
I feel like I'm giving them
these really good tattoos

20:08.540 --> 20:12.252
that were just as good as
Steve's, Jamie's, and Sarah's.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.755
But their [bleep] is,
like, professional,

20:14.838 --> 20:18.050
and your style is just a few
levels above street level.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.012
You--Am I making any sense?

20:22.095 --> 20:23.013
Just whatever.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.473
{\an8}You can say
whatever the [bleep] you want,

20:24.556 --> 20:25.974
{\an8}because your opinion
means [bleep] to me.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.560
<i>You don't even know what it</i>
<i>takes to do a good tattoo,</i>

20:28.644 --> 20:30.395
so how can you even judge?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.439
Kay Kutta needs
to leave already.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.778
Today you must create
a <i> Star Wars</i> tattoo.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.321
Remember, we're testing
for contrast.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.907
Your design better pop,
or you'll be headed home.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.660
You have five hours to tattoo,

20:44.743 --> 20:47.037
and your time starts now.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.830
[music]

20:48.914 --> 20:50.165
Let's do this.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.167
{\an8}In this challenge,
we're looking for contrast.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.835
Star Wars imagery is gonna be
really good for that.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.213
A lot of these strong images can
be darkly lit or brightly lit.

20:56.296 --> 20:59.049
Now's your time
to make the emperor proud.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.676
And I just want to see
these artists make

21:00.759 --> 21:02.177
these recognizable images
really come to life.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.512
{\an5}-Oh, that's great.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.512
-Cool, right?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.347
Yeah.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.642
Love it. I love it.
Absolutely love it.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.978
<i>Clint tried to trip me up</i>
<i>a little bit on this one.</i>

21:11.061 --> 21:12.562
{\an8}My subject matter
is pretty limited.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.731
<i>I'm doing white Clone Trooper</i>

21:14.815 --> 21:16.441
with the Imperial Cog
as the background.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.693
That is the coolest thing
in the world.

21:17.776 --> 21:18.860
I came up with the idea
to make the Cog

21:18.944 --> 21:21.905
a view port into space.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.741
I'm using that as a window to
kind of showcase that contrast.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.867
All right, you ready?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.202
{\an5}-Yep.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.202
-All right, here we go.

21:27.285 --> 21:29.329
The judges want a masterpiece,
and I'm going to deliver.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.789
"These aren't the Droids
you're looking for."

21:30.872 --> 21:32.040
[laughs] Yeah.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.209
[tattoo gun buzzing]

21:34.292 --> 21:37.713
I got one of the canvases
that I actually recognized.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.922
Doesn't look like a frog.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.382
I'm very critical of Yoda.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.717
Your sketch was dead on,
which was awesome.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.719
[laughs]

21:43.802 --> 21:45.595
So let's see what
the Tatu Baby's doing.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.764
{\an5}-Oh, cool.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.764
-Yoda.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.809
I think that she actually got
one of the easiest tattoos.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.060
<i>But I don't know if she has</i>
<i>what it takes</i>

21:52.144 --> 21:54.229
to win the <i> Star Wars</i> challenge.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.982
This challenge is awesome.
I love <i> Star Wars</i>

21:57.065 --> 22:00.152

22:01.611 --> 22:02.988
You're sitting great.

22:03.071 --> 22:07.617
<i>My canvas has agreed</i>
<i>to let me do the C-3PO.</i>

22:07.701 --> 22:10.579
{\an8}But C-3PO has a lot
of little tiny details.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.539
{\an5}-How you looking on time?

22:10.662 --> 22:12.539
-I mean, you know,

22:12.622 --> 22:13.874
would love to have
a little bit more,

22:13.957 --> 22:15.751
but gotta do what you gotta do.

22:15.834 --> 22:16.793
Knowing how much is involved,

22:16.877 --> 22:17.794
I'm kind of concerned
that I'll be able

22:17.878 --> 22:19.254
to get the contrast as thick

22:19.337 --> 22:21.214
as I would want in five hours.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.843
Wow.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.303
Dude, I'm sure the [bleep] glad

22:26.386 --> 22:28.555
that I didn't do
the full-sized Chewbacca,

22:28.638 --> 22:31.099
'cause there's no way my
client would make it through it.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.477
He's not handling
the pain very well.

22:36.855 --> 22:37.939
So far, it doesn't hurt at all.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.192
{\an5}-Oh, for him?

22:38.023 --> 22:40.192
-Yeah.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.152
<i>I just need to get</i>
<i>this thing on there solid,</i>

22:42.235 --> 22:43.653

pretty quick.

<i>'Cause I think he's gonna be</i>
<i>done before I am.</i>

<i>in the right amount of time.</i>

{\an5}-No, I didn't. I--

23:08.804 --> 23:10.722
-Yeah, you did.

<i>about what I'm doing,</i>

business

the tattoos

that these people are doing,

23:28.073 --> 23:30.700
not judge me
on the tattoos I gave 'em.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.453
You know, what--
what's gonna look cool

23:33.537 --> 23:35.080
is the fact that you got all,
like, these dark colors up here?

23:35.163 --> 23:36.248
When you do the red,

23:36.331 --> 23:37.374
that's gonna stick out
like neon.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.085
{\an5}-That is the plan, my friend.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.085
-[laughs]

23:40.168 --> 23:41.628
{\an8}Okay, this guy's all red,

23:41.711 --> 23:42.879
so I'm not gonna do
his whole body.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.172
I'm gonna do, like,
the upper part

23:44.256 --> 23:46.216
and have the death star ship
in the background

23:46.299 --> 23:48.301
with the lights
and the atmosphere

23:48.385 --> 23:50.137
to create that contrast.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.222
Without it, I'm [bleep].

23:54.683 --> 23:56.268
Now I think I know
why Clint gave it to you.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.435
What, did you piss him off?

23:57.519 --> 23:58.812
<i>Kay is gonna screw himself over.</i>

23:58.895 --> 24:00.188
I don't need to help him out
on that.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.190
What's going here, Kay Kutta?

24:02.274 --> 24:04.401
I mean, it--he gave me
a big red guy, man.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.402
There's not a tattoo up there
that he would've been like,

24:05.485 --> 24:08.238
"Oh, thank you so much
for giving me that."

24:08.321 --> 24:09.197
He goes for it.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.241
The kid tries
his [bleep] hardest.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.243
{\an5}-It looks rough, though.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.243
-It looks terrible.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.830
<i>Think I might be biting off</i>
<i>more than I can chew,</i>

24:16.913 --> 24:19.499
but if I don't do one of my best
tattoos I've done,

24:19.583 --> 24:21.209
it's gonna be a battle
for the bottom

24:21.293 --> 24:22.878
between me and Mark.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.505
Two more hours.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.383
Hey, Jamie,

24:28.466 --> 24:30.468
if I were to fill in
those gaps with a color,

24:30.552 --> 24:32.387
what color would you recommend?

24:32.471 --> 24:32.554
Would that work?

24:34.014 --> 24:35.348
Purple?

24:35.432 --> 24:37.225
I wouldn't get too dark
against that black and that red.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.894
It's gonna have to be something
that's gonna pop,

24:38.977 --> 24:40.312
like a light blue,
light green, light yellow.

24:40.395 --> 24:41.688
I wouldn't go dark purple.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.899
Mark needs to work
on his color theory for sure.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.650
<i>Everything's turning out</i>
<i>really, really dark.</i>

24:45.734 --> 24:47.736
Yeah, that's what's gonna
make 'em pop.

24:47.819 --> 24:48.945
{\an8}I end up not listening to him

24:49.029 --> 24:50.447
because I think the purple
creates enough contrast

24:50.530 --> 24:53.241
to get the helmet
to pop a little bit.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.285
This is what the [bleep] is up.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.247
What up, sir?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.084
That's bad-ass, bro.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.503
{\an8}I thought of a cool way
to bump up the contrast.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.255
{\an8}<i>I'm gonna add</i>
<i>the background of space</i>

25:07.339 --> 25:08.590
{\an8}<i>blending out a little bit.</i>

25:08.673 --> 25:10.926
What do you think about my level
of contrast in this joint?

25:11.009 --> 25:12.510
I'd pump up the yellows.

25:12.594 --> 25:14.304
Like, yellow yellow.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.097
<i>Sebastian's main problem</i>

25:16.181 --> 25:18.558
is he doesn't have a lot
of imagination

25:18.642 --> 25:19.643
when it comes to doing tattoos.

25:19.726 --> 25:20.769
He can tattoo a picture,

25:20.852 --> 25:23.438
but when it comes
to composing a tattoo,

25:23.521 --> 25:24.856
like, he's lost.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.234
Two-minute warning.

25:27.317 --> 25:31.404
[suspenseful music]

25:31.488 --> 25:33.615
{\an5}-We'll make it, right?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.615
-Oh, yeah.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.618
{\an8}Super contrasting,
so I think I'm hitting the mark.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.621
It's just not a tattoo
with any of my style.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.623
Ten, nine,

25:41.706 --> 25:43.458
eight, seven,

25:43.541 --> 25:45.168
six, five,

25:45.252 --> 25:49.130
four, three, two, one.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.801
That's it. Time's up.
Machines down. No more ink.

[whistles]

25:54.010 --> 25:55.136
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

25:55.220 --> 25:56.513
So come on.
Let's take a look at it.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.597
Okay.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.391
<i>I just think</i>
<i>I really took the word contrast</i>

25:59.474 --> 26:02.435
to the umpth degree,
and it's just too much.

26:02.519 --> 26:02.978
Hope you like it.
It's gonna be there a while.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.854
Yeah, I love it.

26:04.938 --> 26:05.981
I'm a little concerned.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.274
Ha, ha. Wow.

26:07.357 --> 26:11.569
That is phenomenal.
Holy cow.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.029
It's your <i> Star</i> <i>Wars</i> tattoo,
man.

26:13.113 --> 26:16.283
Aw, damn, that is sweet.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.450
<i>I can see where</i>
<i>I over-thought my design.</i>

26:17.534 --> 26:20.287
If it doesn't have contrast,
I'm dead.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.249
{\an8}I'm shooting at you!

26:24.332 --> 26:25.166
{\an8}I'm shooting at you!

26:25.250 --> 26:26.835
{\an8}I'm shooting at everybody
at the top!

26:26.918 --> 26:27.794
{\an8}I'm just keepin' it gangsta!

26:27.877 --> 26:29.379
Not the best tattoo
you've done for us.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.506
Looks like
he's wearing lunchmeat.

26:31.589 --> 26:32.841
Well, I gotta say,
[bleep] that [bleep].

26:34.092 --> 26:36.636
[music]

26:37.804 --> 26:39.055
Clint, I gotta say it, man.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.182
I looked out for you
when you was down, man.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.851
Pulled you off the ledge, man.

26:42.934 --> 26:46.104
Are you just that much
of a disloyal mother[bleep]?

26:46.938 --> 26:48.356
What are you getting at?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.483
You gave me an all-red
mother[bleep]

26:50.567 --> 26:52.193
In a contrast challenge.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.695
So I got to damn near throw
the emperor

26:53.778 --> 26:55.322
with his [bleep] in his hand
in the background

26:55.405 --> 26:57.449
so mother[bleep] know this
is some <i> Star Wars</i> [bleep].

26:57.532 --> 26:59.117
I find it funny that Kay's upset

26:59.200 --> 27:00.785
that someone tried
to screw him over,

27:00.869 --> 27:02.871
'cause he's been trying
to screw over everybody else.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.540
I threw you a bone by giving you
one that had color within.

27:05.623 --> 27:07.375
I threw this mother[bleep]
under the bus.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.376
Gave me
a black and gray wookiee.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.129
I threw this mother[bleep]
a hard one.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.340
Are you stupid?

27:13.423 --> 27:16.551
When you have an opportunity
to really [bleep] the best,

27:16.634 --> 27:18.428
pull your [bleep] out
and [bleep] the best.

27:18.511 --> 27:19.554
But, Kay, he's in the middle.

27:19.637 --> 27:21.765
So he needs to shoot
for the middle.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.266
Who you gonna shoot for?
You gonna shoot for Steve and I?

27:23.350 --> 27:26.644
Man, if I'm here tomorrow,

27:26.728 --> 27:27.562
and I won a Flash Challenge,

27:27.645 --> 27:30.732
put on your vest,
put on your helmet.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.525
I'm shooting at you!
I'm shooting at you!

27:32.609 --> 27:34.861
I'm shooting at everybody
at the top,

27:34.944 --> 27:36.363
'cause I'm gonna die anyway!

27:36.446 --> 27:37.781
{\an5}-[laughter]

27:36.446 --> 27:37.781
-I'm just keepin' it gangsta!

27:37.864 --> 27:39.157
That's just me, though.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.450
That's just me.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.371
[heavy metal music]

27:46.998 --> 27:49.793
[dramatic music]

27:57.342 --> 28:00.261
This week, we had you create
a <i> Star Wars</i> tattoo.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.971
We were testing contrast.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.558
Clint, you are up first.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.144
Tell me a little bit
about this design.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.063
The natural color
of the character's red,

28:10.146 --> 28:13.566
so I had to use every possible
means to create contrast.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.902
This is a very smooth tattoo.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.445
You added a couple extra tones
in your darkness

28:17.529 --> 28:20.073
of the red,
which I think is nice.

28:20.156 --> 28:22.117
What I think would've been
a little nicer--

28:22.200 --> 28:23.451
from the purple to the red,

28:23.535 --> 28:24.577
you kind of lose
a little bit there.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.204
You don't really add
much contrast to that.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.456
Just kind of gets so dark
on that one side of the face.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.916
Going across the middle
of the face,

28:29.999 --> 28:32.168
you didn't use that contrast
to make that nose

28:32.252 --> 28:34.671
and that bridge and those
wrinkles all stand out.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.464
There's not any highlights
or real hot spots

28:36.548 --> 28:37.132
to make it not as flat.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.134
It's contrast day.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.468
That's what I'm taking
out of it.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.386
Realize that at this point
in the competition,

28:41.469 --> 28:43.680
if you do 90% of a good tattoo,

28:43.763 --> 28:46.975
but that 10% of the tattoo
that you lacked on

28:47.058 --> 28:47.809
doesn't hit hard,

28:47.892 --> 28:49.352
that can get you gone that day.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.606
Kay.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.442
How do you feel about the canvas
that Clint assigned you?

28:55.525 --> 28:57.986
For what it is, my guy loved it.

28:58.069 --> 28:59.404
He's spent more time
than I've been alive

28:59.487 --> 29:01.531
dressing up as these guys.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.700
What I mostly didn't like is
he's all red.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.785
So you gotta put something
behind him.

29:05.869 --> 29:06.911
You didn't detail
this thing out.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.956
You could've showed
these wrinkles and this cloth

29:10.039 --> 29:12.250
to look like fabric,
to give that contrast

29:12.333 --> 29:13.960
to make this thing look real.

29:14.043 --> 29:14.794
It doesn't have drapery feel.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.087
Looks like
he's wearing lunchmeat.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.507
That's one way to look at it,
but one thing I do want to add

29:19.591 --> 29:21.217
is that these guys,
they do one thing:

29:21.301 --> 29:23.261
They stand there.
That's pretty much it.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.680
They have a little more detail
than your tattoo does.

29:27.724 --> 29:27.932
Sebastian.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.353
What did the client
ask for, specifically?

29:32.437 --> 29:34.189
He was like,
"I want the star destroyer,

29:34.272 --> 29:34.898
and I want the Tie Fighters."

29:34.981 --> 29:35.732
I'm like, "Man, there is no way

29:35.815 --> 29:36.816
I'm gonna be able
to finish this."

29:36.900 --> 29:40.153
Overall, as a tattoo,
it's an awkward shape.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.529
It doesn't flow anywhere.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.656
To me, this is just
a lack of really understanding

29:43.740 --> 29:44.866
how to nail
a good, clean background.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.202
I was like, "Okay, let me try
to get some

29:47.285 --> 29:48.536
space flowing
in here somewhere."

29:48.620 --> 29:50.246
I was like,
"I can't color his whole back."

29:50.330 --> 29:51.623
I just think
you muddied it a bit.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.334
It got a little too dark towards
the back of the destroyer.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.461
In my opinion,
that's where this went wrong.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.382
Jamie.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.843
Tell us about the design process
for this.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.720
Originally, he wanted Chewbacca
where he had his crossbow.

30:05.803 --> 30:08.014
I thought back
to my Wolf Challenge,

30:08.097 --> 30:09.641
what I wished I would've done
with that.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.809
So I switched gears,
and we did the portrait.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.062
This is what I wish you
would've done with the Wolf Man,

30:14.145 --> 30:15.480
really showing the hair,

30:15.563 --> 30:18.525
bringing in that whole side
of the head with all that black,

30:18.608 --> 30:20.360
and bringing it into the light
in the center.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.362
You know, I wanted it to be
really readable from a distance,

30:22.445 --> 30:24.030
so I kept going back with black

30:24.113 --> 30:26.491
and really trying
to over-accentuate the one side.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.409
This is the way
to show the contrast.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.411
This is a good one.
It's a good outing for you.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.289
Mark.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.460
So last week, you had
a little bit of a rough go.

30:37.544 --> 30:38.586
How do you think
you did this week?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.755
Feel like I did okay
with the foreground.

30:40.838 --> 30:41.839
The background probably could've
done a little bit better.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.509
Those colors, man,
those are no-nos.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.719
Side by side, especially
in a graphic way like this,

30:46.803 --> 30:48.263
it's not gonna work out.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.098
Purple is a mean, nasty color,

30:50.181 --> 30:52.600
and this is one of those times
where it is hurting you.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.227
I've known
all this [bleep] before,

30:54.310 --> 30:56.104
but I've been
so far removed from it

30:56.187 --> 30:57.855
and just thinking
I could auto-pilot on this

30:57.939 --> 30:59.649
because I'd been doing it
for so long.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.026
This is a good wakeup
reality slap, man.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.778
Hard head gotta feel it
to believe it.

31:03.861 --> 31:04.821
I feel it right now.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.864
Auto-pilot's not where
you want to be, man.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.116
You want to be in control.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.993
You want to be the master
of your own destiny, man.

31:14.289 --> 31:17.000
Sarah.

31:17.083 --> 31:17.709
What did the client ask for?

31:17.792 --> 31:19.961
He wanted the Imperial Cog,

31:20.044 --> 31:21.129
with, like,
the trooper in front,

31:21.212 --> 31:22.005
and he didn't even want
all this detail.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.048
What I did was
I showed him my stuff

31:24.132 --> 31:24.924
and said, "This is the direction
I want to go."

31:25.008 --> 31:27.260
So from that point on,
I was like,

31:27.343 --> 31:28.303
"Yes!"

31:28.386 --> 31:29.554
We hounded on you for putting

31:29.637 --> 31:31.681
too much white in things
and using too many light colors,

31:31.764 --> 31:33.474
and this is what
we're talking about.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.019
The colors you used
in the armor to shadow it,

31:36.102 --> 31:37.645
it looks dimensional.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.439
I took what you guys said
to heart,

31:39.522 --> 31:40.773
and I used a lot of skin breaks.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.985
And what I did to show the white
on that trooper

31:44.068 --> 31:45.320
was just from the contrast
of the darker colors.

31:45.403 --> 31:49.324
That use of contrast in a very
insignificant part of the tattoo

31:49.407 --> 31:50.491
is very impressive.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.452
You've really made
an improvement.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.748
Jesse.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.916
I know your client
initially wanted

31:59.000 --> 32:00.585
C-3PO and R2-D2.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.795
She didn't want a floating head,
which is what she got.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.547
In order to convince her
to get a floating head,

32:04.631 --> 32:06.507
I told her that, uh,
it would be difficult

32:06.591 --> 32:08.051
to make both of those happen
in five hours.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.011
You definitely needed
to up the contrast.

32:10.094 --> 32:13.306
From a distance, it just looks
like a light bulb.

32:13.389 --> 32:14.766
There's very little black
in this design.

32:14.849 --> 32:17.101
In the black
that is in the tattoo,

32:17.185 --> 32:18.978
it doesn't give
this thing shape.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.147
At the end, I was kicking
more blacks in there,

32:21.230 --> 32:22.690
trying to bump that contrast.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.276
Not at all
what I expected from you.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.361
How do you think you did?

32:26.444 --> 32:27.445
I was working too far
off the reference.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.405
I hate to use this as an excuse,
but I haven't done

32:29.489 --> 32:30.740
anything like this
for a long time.

32:30.823 --> 32:32.825
This is probably
the closest thing

32:32.909 --> 32:33.826
to you that's left.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.536
Nothing on the way
is gonna be you.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.996
Good luck.

32:38.956 --> 32:40.249
Steve.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.044
Tell me about this design.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.504
It's a female Jedi

32:44.587 --> 32:46.589
with tentacles on her head
and a lightsaber.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.050
Not the best tattoo
you've done for us.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.678
It bugs me that the hand
that's holding the lightsaber,

32:51.761 --> 32:54.097
the top two fingers
are completely orange,

32:54.180 --> 32:55.890
and the bottom two
are completely blue.

32:55.973 --> 32:56.557
It's not like the light
is just hitting

32:56.641 --> 32:58.768
the tops of the fingers,

32:58.851 --> 33:00.687
but it's just the whole fingers,
all the way around.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.730
You just took that contrast
to the limit,

33:02.814 --> 33:05.149
and I just don't feel
like there's any blending

33:05.233 --> 33:06.234
from dark to light.

33:06.317 --> 33:06.943
You know, I knew
with a hot light source,

33:07.026 --> 33:09.028
there was gonna be harsh lines.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.114
It's a little more graphic than
I'd like to go,

33:11.197 --> 33:12.240
but it's so small,

33:12.323 --> 33:13.491
it ended up being comic-booky.

33:13.574 --> 33:15.034
This is not a tattoo
that I would expect from you.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.954
In this competition,
this may come down

33:18.037 --> 33:20.081
to who did nicer stuff
all the way along.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.499
This tattoo right here

33:21.582 --> 33:23.751
could be the one
that cost you the 100 grand.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.591
Tatu Baby.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.761
Are you happy that you got
this particular canvas?

33:33.845 --> 33:34.846
{\an8}I haven't seen the movie,

33:34.929 --> 33:37.265
{\an8}but one of the characters
that I was most familiar

33:37.348 --> 33:38.516
{\an8}was this one.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.518
I was like, "I hope I get
the little green guy."

33:40.601 --> 33:42.019
You really knocked it
out of the park,

33:42.103 --> 33:44.105
{\an8}capturing the depth in his eyes

33:44.188 --> 33:46.482
{\an8}and the underside of his chin,
where it's real dark,

33:46.566 --> 33:48.651
{\an8}and the light side of his face,
where it's real light.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.778
Exactly what this challenge
was asking.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.613
I felt like I had
a lot of pressure.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.782
{\an8}I'm doing something
that I know nothing about,

33:54.866 --> 33:56.951
{\an8}dealing with somebody
who's an expert in it,

33:57.034 --> 34:00.037
and I just have to make sure
that I give her a great tattoo.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.706
{\an8}The contrast you put
in this thing

34:01.789 --> 34:02.957
{\an8}with the green and the purple,

34:03.040 --> 34:05.251
just that tiny little accent
of purple under the collar,

34:05.334 --> 34:06.753
great way to bounce
the color palette

34:06.836 --> 34:07.879
off of each other.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.255
I feel like you knocked off
a lot of the big guys

34:09.338 --> 34:13.467
that underestimated you,
and this is a big move for you.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.052
So keep the momentum.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.681
Okay, artists,
head back to the loft.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.685
For one of you,
it'll be your last visit.

34:22.768 --> 34:25.646
When you return, someone will be
packing their machines

34:25.730 --> 34:27.607
and closing shop.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.484
We'll call you back
when we've made our decision.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.277
[dramatic music]

34:37.116 --> 34:38.784
{\an5}-Beautiful tattoo, sweetie.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.784
-Thank you.

34:38.868 --> 34:39.827
Beautiful.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.661
{\an8}I did a rocking-ass tattoo.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.663
I'm just super excited.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.166
I feel like I'm going
down a good road,

34:45.248 --> 34:47.460
and I just want
to keep excelling.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.085
Nailed it. Seriously.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.214
That's--those are impressive,

34:51.297 --> 34:52.507
super impressive tattoos.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.717
I wouldn't know
how to judge these two apart.

34:55.802 --> 34:58.096
They were both awesome pieces,
but I think that, uh,

34:58.179 --> 35:00.973
Tatu Baby's had more contrast.

35:01.057 --> 35:04.435
{\an8}I think baby actually
got a really easy tattoo.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.186
Mine was really technical.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.187
I literally went in and, like,

35:06.270 --> 35:08.689
I was like this close
away from the skin,

35:08.773 --> 35:09.816
making sure
that every single line

35:09.899 --> 35:11.984
was, like, nitpickingly perfect.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.611
<i>Sarah's so defensive.</i>

35:13.694 --> 35:14.654
But I think that Sarah
at this point

35:14.737 --> 35:17.114
feels threatened by me.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.533
Mine was a very strong tattoo.

35:18.616 --> 35:19.826
I really like the way
it turned out.

35:19.909 --> 35:23.329
Regardless, though,
you were top three today.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.997
{\an5}-Like--

35:23.412 --> 35:24.997
-I think she was number one.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.334
{\an5}-Aw.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.334
-I think one,

35:28.417 --> 35:29.210
Jamie two, and you three.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.921
I mean,
just based off of contrast.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.257
I actually looked up
the definition of contrast

35:34.340 --> 35:37.009
to remind myself,
like, what contrast is about.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.262
I think--
I think, as an art student,

35:39.345 --> 35:42.682
I-I have a little bit
more understanding

35:42.765 --> 35:45.226
of line, color, texture,

35:45.309 --> 35:47.061
and everything.

35:47.144 --> 35:49.730
{\an8}I think Sarah might have
a mental breakdown

35:49.814 --> 35:51.357
if she doesn't win
this challenge.

35:52.441 --> 35:55.361
[music]

35:56.404 --> 35:58.489
I told him not to put
that purple in there.

35:58.573 --> 35:59.907
I said use a light green.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.242
That hurt you for sure.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.910
Doesn't matter.
The rest of the tattoo

36:02.994 --> 36:05.288
looked like [bleep] once it was
that big anyways, man.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.748
And if that's what the [bleep]
I'm producing,

36:07.832 --> 36:09.250
and I gotta go downstairs
against a mother[bleep]

36:09.333 --> 36:11.919
That's only been tattooing
three years, bro,

36:12.003 --> 36:15.464
I really need to question
my status.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.925
<i>I'm definitely disappointed</i>
<i>in my performance,</i>

36:18.009 --> 36:19.802
especially with the adjustments
I made

36:19.886 --> 36:22.346
to take away every excuse
up until this point.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.764
I feel like I'm straight
embarrassing myself

36:23.848 --> 36:25.850
on this [bleep], man.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.771
All right, guys,
<i>Star Wars</i> tattoos.

36:30.855 --> 36:31.981
Testing contrast.

36:32.064 --> 36:33.774
This is my favorite
of the day, Sarah.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.110
{\an5}-Everything looks bad-ass.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.110
-Unbelievable.

36:36.193 --> 36:37.695
The Stormtrooper looks white

36:37.778 --> 36:40.239
just by using the contrast
of the other colors.

36:40.323 --> 36:41.407
It's a really good effect.

36:41.490 --> 36:42.909
Now, I love this from Jamie,

36:42.992 --> 36:44.577
this black and gray Chewbacca.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.830
You can tell how deep the eyes
in Chewbacca are

36:47.914 --> 36:50.166
because of Jamie's use
of contrast.

36:50.249 --> 36:50.917
He didn't pound
a bunch of gray in

36:51.000 --> 36:53.210
for a senseless purpose.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.588
He brought that black
to that gray

36:55.671 --> 36:56.672
to that skin tone.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.341
I know we're gonna have
major disagreements

36:58.424 --> 37:01.135
{\an3}on who's gonna win this thing,
but this is definitely up there.

37:01.219 --> 37:01.969
Moving along. Tatu Baby.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.597
For this particular challenge,

37:04.680 --> 37:05.431
{\an8}the Yoda is my fav.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.099
{\an8}The nice, gradual building
of tones

37:07.183 --> 37:08.559
that give this thing
the texture.

37:08.643 --> 37:12.313
The indentions in his head
and the creases and everything,

37:12.396 --> 37:13.564
that is contrast right there.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.733
I can't lie to you.
I know Sarah's talented.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.777
But I didn't know this girl
was this talented.

37:17.860 --> 37:18.861
Well, I think we know
who our bottoms are.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.237
Sucks, but we got three.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.823
{\an5}-Kay Kutta.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.823
-It's just a mess, man.

37:22.907 --> 37:23.908
{\an5}-Yeah.

37:22.907 --> 37:23.908
-What's missing in this,

37:23.991 --> 37:24.825
and it's very noticeable,

37:24.909 --> 37:26.661
is the highlights
and the lowlights.

37:26.744 --> 37:29.497
{\an5}-Doesn't have a lot dimension.

37:26.744 --> 37:29.497
-He's outclassed.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.999
And Mark is teeter-tottering
on his level, man.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.669
This is a prime example
of bad background.

37:34.752 --> 37:35.378
It doesn't look smooth.

37:35.461 --> 37:37.463
It doesn't look like it belongs.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.173
It doesn't really go
with the tattoo.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.676
He didn't use the contrast
to create the illusion

37:41.759 --> 37:42.510
that this is not flat.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.971
Let's move along
to Steve's tattoo.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.514
I hate this thing from Steve.

37:46.597 --> 37:47.974
This was a big letdown.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.183
He left it comic-booky
instead of...

37:49.266 --> 37:51.769
Giving us some contrast
and dimension,

37:51.852 --> 37:53.145
like other contestants did.

37:53.229 --> 37:56.273
I wasn't joking when I said
this could cost him 100 grand.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.150
I think we're all set, man.
You wanna go get 'em?

38:01.862 --> 38:03.781
You miss me, Ollie? I'm coming.

38:03.864 --> 38:05.908
All right, guys,
we need to see Tatu Baby,

38:05.992 --> 38:09.078
Kay Kutta, Mark, and Sarah.

38:09.161 --> 38:09.495
All right, guys,
we'll see you in the shop.

38:13.916 --> 38:16.919
[suspenseful music]

38:23.926 --> 38:25.678
Two of you impressed us,

38:25.761 --> 38:27.054
and two of you did not.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.264
Sarah and Tatu Baby,

38:28.347 --> 38:31.726
you guys have
the top two tattoos.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.394
The judges have come
to a decision.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.313
The best tattoo of the day...

38:37.940 --> 38:38.357
Goes to Tatu Baby.

38:39.900 --> 38:40.526
For real?

38:40.609 --> 38:42.236
{\an5}-For real.

38:40.609 --> 38:42.236
-Thank you.

38:42.319 --> 38:45.448
Tatu Baby, the tattoo you did
was outstanding.

38:45.531 --> 38:46.198
You bounced
the right color palette.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.409
You made the tattoo really pop.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.161
Overall, it really
all came together

38:50.244 --> 38:51.370
for you well today.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.416
Mark and Kay,

38:55.499 --> 38:57.418
neither of you
impressed us today.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.627
Mark, the tattoo you did today,

38:58.711 --> 39:02.089
I honestly feel from seeing
the other tattoos you've done

39:02.173 --> 39:03.716
that you could do better
than this.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.468
The shading is not as smooth
as it could've been.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.635
As far as the composition
and the colors,

39:06.719 --> 39:08.888
bad choices.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.222
I'm like rocky right here.
Keep getting my ass whooped.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.224
But until the fight's over,
I'm in the game.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.769
I mean, sometimes
I over-think things,

39:14.852 --> 39:16.479
and today,
I really thought I wasn't.

39:16.562 --> 39:19.273
All I can do is take the lesson
learned and move forward.

39:19.356 --> 39:21.609
I just want to assure you guys
that's exactly what I'm doing.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.528
This competition doesn't get
easier as time goes on.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.655
Chances are, next week's
gonna be the same story.

39:28.991 --> 39:30.493
Kay, you're struggling.

39:30.576 --> 39:33.454
You're not able to show
the contrast you need to show

39:33.537 --> 39:34.497
because the images
that you're picking

39:34.580 --> 39:36.457
you're not being able
to convey to the skin.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.293
I respect y'all opinion.
Don't get me wrong.

39:39.376 --> 39:41.212
But I been counted out
for dead before,

39:41.295 --> 39:43.130
so I gotta say
[bleep] that [bleep].

39:43.214 --> 39:44.465
Let me say something
to you, man.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.133
You've got three years.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.511
All you're lacking
is simple technique.

39:48.594 --> 39:49.553
You need that guidance.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.139
My ambition is what got me
standing here.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.808
I know my skill level
don't really match

39:53.891 --> 39:54.391
my ambition at times.

39:54.475 --> 39:56.227
I know I can adjust.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.104
I'm not done fighting.
I'm 100% here.

39:58.187 --> 40:01.649
And I can put out
better tattoos.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.192
The competition's
getting stiffer.

40:03.275 --> 40:04.402
These areas for leniency
are gone.

40:06.445 --> 40:07.488
Either one of you

40:07.571 --> 40:08.739
could justifiably be
sent home tonight.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.867

40:13.953 --> 40:16.122
The judges have decided.

[suspenseful music]

40:22.336 --> 40:26.382
Kay, you do not have what it
takes to be Ink Master.

40:26.465 --> 40:28.008
Plain and simple, man,
there are some people

40:28.092 --> 40:30.928
in this competition that I
really respect their struggle

40:31.011 --> 40:32.513
and their fight,
and you're one of them.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.098
And I think
you're leaving here today

40:34.181 --> 40:35.766
a much better tattooer.

40:35.850 --> 40:36.725
I appreciate you guys, man.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.436
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.980
<i>Even when I'm at the bottom,</i>
<i>I'm looking up.</i>

40:41.063 --> 40:43.190
<i>I'm not looking down.</i>

40:43.274 --> 40:46.193
I'm damn near a born loser,
but I keep winning.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.154
<i>Luckily for me,</i>
<i>that's what I'm used to.</i>

40:48.237 --> 40:50.865
It's not gonna hinder me
from fighting harder.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.366
<i>Y'all ain't seen the last of me.</i>

40:52.449 --> 40:53.617
I'm Kay Kutta, damn it.

{\an8}[narrator] <i> On the next</i>
<i>episode of Ink Master...</i>

40:59.456 --> 41:02.376
{\an8}Today, you'll work
in teams of two.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.711
{\an8}Holy [bleep].

41:03.794 --> 41:04.461
{\an8}-Whew!

41:03.794 --> 41:04.461
{\an8}-Oh!

41:04.545 --> 41:05.838
{\an8}-Mm!

41:04.545 --> 41:05.838
{\an8}-That's impressive.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.840
{\an8}Seriously.

41:07.923 --> 41:09.592
{\an8}I'm pulling more
than my own weight.

41:09.675 --> 41:10.426
{\an8}We are so [bleep].

41:10.509 --> 41:13.679
{\an8}We had a tattoo
at the same time.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.389
{\an8}Sorry I didn't do
a [bleep] moonwalk

41:15.472 --> 41:16.932
{\an8}through the God damn
minefield more.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.602
{\an8}[bleep]! [bleep]!

41:19.685 --> 41:20.269
{\an8}You didn't knock it out
of the park.

41:20.352 --> 41:21.145
{\an8}I'm a really good artist.

41:21.228 --> 41:22.396
{\an8}We can make this a bloodbath

41:22.480 --> 41:24.607
{\an8}or you can understand
what I'm saying.

41:24.690 --> 41:25.691
{\an8}I'm not done.
Don't count me out.
