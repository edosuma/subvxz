From television city

00:04.904 --> 00:08.473
¶ Boy, the way
Glenn Miller played ¶

00:08.540 --> 00:12.210
¶ songs that made
the hit parade ¶

00:12.277 --> 00:15.981
¶ guys like us
we had it made ¶

00:16.047 --> 00:19.084

00:20.419 --> 00:24.255

[ Archie, Edith ]
¶ mister, we could use a man ¶

[ Mike, Gloria arguing ]
All right, all right,
all of youse.

00:59.992 --> 01:02.193
Dummy up, huh ?

01:02.261 --> 01:04.929
'Cause here it is.
Quote--

01:04.997 --> 01:08.900
"and the lord God
caused a deep sleep
to fall upon Adam,

01:08.968 --> 01:10.902
"and he slept.

01:10.970 --> 01:14.939
"And he took one of his ribs
and closed up the flesh
instead thereof.

01:15.007 --> 01:18.009
"And the rib,
which the lord God
had taken from man,

01:18.077 --> 01:21.112
made he a woman
and brought her
unto the man."

01:21.180 --> 01:23.114
[ Barking ]
Mmm !

01:23.182 --> 01:26.885
<i>Ah, cut that out, eh !</i>

01:26.952 --> 01:30.388
That ain't all
he brought her
unto the man for.

01:32.792 --> 01:37.295
"And Adam said, 'this
is now bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh.

01:37.362 --> 01:41.232
She shall be called woman
because she was taken
out of man.'"

01:41.300 --> 01:44.402
now, there it is
in black and white.

01:44.469 --> 01:47.072
We didn't crawl out
from under no rocks.

01:47.139 --> 01:50.241
We didn't have no tails,
and we didn't come from monkeys,

01:50.309 --> 01:53.244
you atheistic,
pinko meathead.

01:56.816 --> 01:58.917
Archie,
that's a fairy tale.

01:58.984 --> 02:02.253
The whole idea
of taking a rib out of Adam
and making a woman,

02:02.321 --> 02:05.023
it's mandrake
the magician time.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.092
Do you hear that ?

02:07.159 --> 02:10.095
He's comparing the lord God
to mandrake the magician.

02:10.162 --> 02:12.097
Can you believe it ?

02:12.164 --> 02:15.433
No. God is
much better known.

02:18.170 --> 02:21.272
Well, youse two may
have come from monkeys
and "bamboons,"

02:21.340 --> 02:23.274
but not me.

02:23.342 --> 02:26.144
The lord God created me
in his image.

02:31.516 --> 02:34.619
You mean God
looks like you ?

02:36.355 --> 02:39.791
I ain't saying
you couldn't tell
the two of us apart.

02:41.593 --> 02:43.527
Just saying he
made us like him.

02:43.595 --> 02:46.998
Like, for instance,
with four fingers and
a thumb on each hand.

02:47.066 --> 02:51.469
He saw that one hand
wasn't gonna be enough,
so he give us two of them.

02:51.536 --> 02:54.305
And then he put
the hands here...

02:54.373 --> 02:56.307
On the end
of the arms...

02:56.375 --> 02:59.144
Because he knew that's
where they'd be handy.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.815
That's why
they're called hands,
I suppose.

03:05.851 --> 03:07.786
Will you stifle
yourself !

03:07.853 --> 03:10.822
God don't want to be
defended by no dingbat.

03:12.224 --> 03:14.659
Look, Archie, you're
misunderstanding us.

03:14.726 --> 03:17.829
We don't have anything
against God
or the notion of God.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.832
I-it's what people do
in his name
that we don't like.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.068
People hate in his name,
people kill in his name.

03:24.136 --> 03:26.737
That's right, daddy.
Look at Vietnam.

03:26.806 --> 03:30.608
We're there
with his blessings,
because God is on our side.

03:30.676 --> 03:33.678
Well ?
[ Chuckling ]

03:33.745 --> 03:38.416
You ain't gonna tell me
he's on the side
of them godless gooks.

03:38.483 --> 03:42.620
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>
<i>Why not ? God created</i>
<i>them gooks, too, didn't he ?</i>

03:42.688 --> 03:44.989
I don't wanna talk
to you no more.

03:45.057 --> 03:47.292
Hi.
Hi, Mrs. bunker.
Hi, everybody.

03:47.359 --> 03:50.295
[ Mike ] Hi, Lionel.
We're just finishing
Saturday brunch.

03:50.362 --> 03:52.297
Would you like
to have something ?

03:52.364 --> 03:55.834
Yeah, go on over there,
and you can take my chair,
Lionel.

03:55.901 --> 03:59.204
Just sit down next to
the gook lovers, huh ?

03:59.271 --> 04:02.540
I gotta go up
and take a shave.
Come on, Lionel.

04:02.607 --> 04:04.976
No, thanks.
I've already eaten,
Mrs. bunker.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.545
I just stopped by
to find out if tonight
is still on.

04:07.612 --> 04:09.580
Tonight ?
What's happening
tonight, mom ?

04:09.648 --> 04:11.582
Uh...

04:11.650 --> 04:16.221
I met Lionel's mother
in the supermarket
yesterday.

04:16.288 --> 04:18.589
Well, you tell 'em,
Lionel.

04:18.656 --> 04:22.327
My mom invited
your mother and father
over for dinner tonight.

04:22.394 --> 04:24.462
Really ?
That's wonderful !

04:24.529 --> 04:26.464
You're kidding.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.568
- And you accepted, ma ?
- Yeah.

04:30.635 --> 04:33.071
Oh, that's great !

04:33.138 --> 04:37.075
<i>So they'll expect you</i>
<i>about 7:00 ?</i>
<i>Uh-- uh-huh.</i>

04:40.712 --> 04:43.381
Okay. They're really
looking forward to it.
I'll see you.

04:43.448 --> 04:47.085
Lionel, I think it's
really super our folks are
getting together for dinner.

04:47.152 --> 04:49.787
I couldn't believe it myself
till I heard it
with my own ears.

04:49.855 --> 04:51.789
Are you gonna
be there ?
No.

04:51.857 --> 04:55.826
But I'd sure like to tape
the whole thing for my class
in interracial communications.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.763
I'll see you.
Yeah, Lionel.
Bye-bye.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.765
Hey, ma,
that's wonderful.

05:00.832 --> 05:04.769
Daddy actually accepted
to have dinner
with the jeffersons ?

05:04.836 --> 05:08.106
It's amazing.
I never thought that
would ever happen.

05:08.173 --> 05:10.108
[ Gloria ]
That's really great !

05:11.710 --> 05:14.645
You have discussed this
with daddy, haven't you ?

05:15.847 --> 05:18.049
How does this sound ?

05:18.117 --> 05:20.184
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson.

05:20.252 --> 05:23.854
About dinner tonight,
my husband's Uncle
just died.

05:23.923 --> 05:26.925
Mother !
His aunt just died ?

05:26.992 --> 05:29.193
You can't say that.
His aunt's in a coma.

05:29.261 --> 05:33.231
<i>Mother, stop.</i>
<i>You didn't tell daddy</i>
<i>about this, did you ?</i>

05:33.299 --> 05:35.533
I was too scared to.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.969
Then I started to,
and then he started
telling me...

05:38.037 --> 05:41.372
About having tickets
for the mets game tonight.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.475
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Then I got scared
again.

05:44.543 --> 05:46.811
Gloria, what am I
gonna do ?

05:46.878 --> 05:49.480
Go to dinner, ma,
and make daddy go with you.

05:49.548 --> 05:52.283
But how ?
You know your father.

05:52.351 --> 05:56.487
He ain't unclenched his teeth
since the day they moved in.

05:59.191 --> 06:02.994
Ma, I mean, knowing Archie,
how'd you happen to accept
in the first place ?

06:03.062 --> 06:04.996
Oh, I don't know.

06:05.064 --> 06:08.232
Mrs. Jefferson and me
was havin' a nice talk...

06:08.300 --> 06:10.234
In the supermarket.

06:10.302 --> 06:13.171
And she asked me.
You know me.

06:13.238 --> 06:15.473
I can't say no to nobody.

06:15.540 --> 06:19.477
<i>You can no to me all right.</i>
<i>See ? The nicest woman</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

06:19.544 --> 06:21.679
She can't refuse nothin'
to nobody.

06:21.746 --> 06:24.415
But when her husband
asks her, begs her
not to use his razor,

06:24.483 --> 06:26.417
does she listen to him ?

06:26.485 --> 06:30.754
No. Why don't you just
go out and buy a gun, huh ?
I'll shoot myself.

06:30.822 --> 06:32.923
It'd be a lot less messy.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.926
I cut myself four times
in the last three seconds
up there.

06:35.995 --> 06:40.264
There's pieces of my face
down the drain
on the way to the ocean.

06:40.332 --> 06:43.134
One of these days
I'm gonna "de-head" myself.

06:43.202 --> 06:48.039
Edith, for the last time,
will you please
not use my razor ?

06:48.107 --> 06:51.175
<i>Daddy, I'm glad</i>
<i>you're shaving close...</i>

06:51.243 --> 06:54.512
Because you and ma
have been invited
to dinner tonight.

06:54.579 --> 06:58.182
Dinner ? I'm going
to the mets game tonight.
Mike's going with me.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.584
- I was.
- Huh ?

07:00.652 --> 07:02.887
If you're not going,
I can't go with you.

07:02.954 --> 07:06.357
On the other hand,
I can still go,
so I'll go with Gloria.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.726
What are you talking about ?

07:09.828 --> 07:13.731
These people asked us
to dinner, Archie.

07:14.866 --> 07:16.800
And I said yes.

07:16.868 --> 07:20.371
That was before I knew
you had tickets for the mets.

07:20.439 --> 07:25.843
Now that you know
I got tickets, you can call
"these people" and cancel.

07:25.911 --> 07:29.914
She can't do that, daddy.
These people,
they wouldn't understand.

07:29.981 --> 07:34.085
"These people" ?
Who are these people ?
Tell him, ma.

07:34.153 --> 07:37.922
Oh, that's all right.
You tell him, dear.

07:37.989 --> 07:40.258
I don't mind.
<i>[ Archie ]</i>
<i>Come on !</i>

07:40.325 --> 07:42.927
Somebody better tell me.
Who the hell are they ?

07:42.994 --> 07:45.763
It's the jeffersons,
Archie.

07:45.830 --> 07:50.168
Who are the jeffersons ?
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold it.

07:52.003 --> 07:55.706
You don't mean
them new people that
moved in down the block.

07:55.774 --> 07:59.444
Yeah, Lionel's family.
They're really
very nice people.

07:59.511 --> 08:02.947
Oh, yeah, very nice.
They're wonderful people.
They're lovely people.

08:03.014 --> 08:06.050
But they are also
colored people.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.953
- Better hold it there, daddy.
- Now, listen, little girl.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.422
Been around a lot of places,
done a lot of things,

08:11.490 --> 08:15.960
but there's one thing Archie
bunker ain't never gonna do--
break bread with jungle bunnies.

08:17.429 --> 08:21.099
What did you--
daddy, you stop that.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.801
You're talking
about Lionel's family.

08:23.868 --> 08:26.304
That's right, Archie.
They invited you to dinner.

08:26.371 --> 08:31.109
- They didn't throw a brick
through your window.
- I'd sooner have the brick.

08:31.176 --> 08:34.212
These colored people
are always trying to use
the social situation...

08:34.279 --> 08:36.214
To raise their station.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.216
That's right.

08:38.283 --> 08:42.885
And using you
is gonna launch them
right into cafe society.

08:50.061 --> 08:51.996
Listen, wise guy.

08:52.063 --> 08:56.300
If you wasn't so prejudiced,
you'd know very well
what everybody else knows,

08:56.368 --> 08:58.969
that them people
is inferior to us people.

08:59.037 --> 09:02.640
Daddy, how can a man
who believes in God
talk like that ?

09:02.707 --> 09:05.643
Because I'm using
the common sense
that God gave me.

09:05.710 --> 09:09.013
Common sense ?
Archie, that's
out-and-out hate.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.015
Hate ?

09:11.082 --> 09:15.586
What has any of this
got to do with hate,
you dumb polack ?

09:19.090 --> 09:23.027
I am simply defending
my God-given right
as a free American...

09:23.094 --> 09:26.230
Not to sit down to eat
with my unequals.

09:26.298 --> 09:28.232
Aah !
What's the use ?

09:28.300 --> 09:31.835
Edith, get on that telephone
and cancel this thing
with the jeffersons.

09:31.903 --> 09:35.373
Archie, I can't.
That would hurt
their feelings.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.042
Their feelings ?
What about my feelings ?

09:38.109 --> 09:42.046
Edith, Jim mcnab and me
are circulating a petition
through this neighborhood...

09:42.113 --> 09:44.882
Not to sell no more houses
to no more coloreds.

09:44.949 --> 09:47.218
And here you have me
sitting down to eat...

09:47.286 --> 09:51.055
With the first
colored family that
"infilterated" the block.

09:51.122 --> 09:54.024
I mean, Edith,
I'm "mortifried."

09:54.092 --> 09:59.863
Well, maybe if we just
don't stay too long
after dinner.

09:59.931 --> 10:02.066
No, Edith,
get on that telephone !

10:02.133 --> 10:04.202
Now, wait a second.

10:04.269 --> 10:07.004
Why don't you do
your own dirty work ?

10:07.072 --> 10:10.208
All right, big mouth.
I will. You know the number.
Get them on the wire.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.210
Archie, no.
No, please don't.

10:12.277 --> 10:17.415
I ain't gonna hurt
nobody's feelings.
Sit down, sit down.

10:17.482 --> 10:20.951
Yep, there it is.
It's ringing.

10:21.019 --> 10:23.688
Hello.
Is that Mrs. Jefferson ?

10:23.755 --> 10:27.157
Uh, yeah, well,
this is Mr. bunker here.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.927
Yeah, yeah,
I know about that, but, uh,

10:29.994 --> 10:34.432
we ain't gonna be able
to make it because my wife
twisted her ankle very bad.

10:35.867 --> 10:38.102
<i>Say nothin'.</i>
<i>Now, don't say nothin'.</i>

10:38.169 --> 10:41.539
- Oh, boy.
- Shh, you !

10:42.907 --> 10:44.908
Hello ?
Yes. Yes.

10:44.976 --> 10:47.445
Well, uh,
she twisted it real bad,

10:47.512 --> 10:50.114
and the doctor says
that she can't leave
the house.

10:50.181 --> 10:53.784
Hold on.
The doctor's leaving now.
Uh, so long there, doc.

10:53.852 --> 10:56.954
Yeah, I promise
I won't let her
leave the house.

10:57.021 --> 10:59.957
Don't forget
to send a bill.

11:00.024 --> 11:02.593
Bye-bye. Yeah.

11:02.661 --> 11:05.963
Yeah, well, uh,
it's just one of them
last-minute sprains...

11:06.030 --> 11:07.965
That's goin' around.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.302
All right. I will.
Yeah, I will.

11:11.370 --> 11:16.073
I will. Yep. Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Bye.

11:16.141 --> 11:18.643
Well, there it is.
No fuss, no muss.

11:18.710 --> 11:21.812
Oh, Archie,
that was terrible !

11:21.880 --> 11:24.615
Telling her
a story like that.

11:24.683 --> 11:27.285
Boy, you are some liar.

11:27.352 --> 11:32.055
You know, you oughta be
in the defense department.

11:32.123 --> 11:36.894
Daddy, you're so prejudiced.
You haven't even met
Mr. Jefferson yet.

11:36.961 --> 11:40.898
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>
<i>Fine. And that's just</i>
<i>the way I want to keep it.</i>

11:42.267 --> 11:44.201
Oh, Lionel.
Yeah, Mr. bunker.

11:44.269 --> 11:47.171
When I heard about
Mrs. bunker's ankle,
I rushed right over.

11:47.238 --> 11:49.840
Well, she's in here
resting. Edith.

11:57.416 --> 12:01.185
The doctor said you're
supposed to stay off
your feet, dear.

12:01.252 --> 12:03.187
Sit down.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.195
See what I mean,
Lionel ?

12:11.262 --> 12:13.931
Yeah, I see.
That's a shame.

12:13.998 --> 12:17.802
It's too bad this had
to happen the first time
you were coming to dinner.

12:17.869 --> 12:21.772
Lionel, as they say,
<i>"que</i> 'seray seray,'"
you know.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.509
And we was both lookin'
forward towards it too,
wasn't we, Edith ?

12:25.577 --> 12:27.678
I certainly was.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.113
But, say, Mr. bunker,

12:30.181 --> 12:33.116
are you sure there isn't
somethin' else that's causing
you to cancel tonight ?

12:33.184 --> 12:35.219
No.
You can be straight
with me.

12:35.286 --> 12:38.055
Because, frankly,
we're having problems
with my old man.

12:38.122 --> 12:41.058
What's the matter with him ?
Well, he's kind of
old-fashioned, you know.

12:41.125 --> 12:44.061
Says he just doesn't wanna
sit down with whitey.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.513
Oh, he'll get over it.

13:02.581 --> 13:05.516
I just wanna make sure
you didn't cancel
because my folks are black.

13:05.584 --> 13:08.085
No, Lionel,
we're perfectly willing
to come over...

13:08.152 --> 13:11.489
And pick a few ribs
with your family any time.

13:11.556 --> 13:14.725
It's just that Edith's ankle
the way it is,
we can't make it.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.495
I sure am happy
to hear that, Mr. bunker.

13:17.562 --> 13:20.097
But, say, you won't
be able to cook tonight,
will you ?

13:20.164 --> 13:21.965
No, no, she's gotta
stay off her feet.

13:22.033 --> 13:25.603
Since mom's already fixed
dinner anyway, and you do
wanna meet my folks ?

13:25.670 --> 13:30.107
- Sorry to miss that.
- Then mom will be happy to
bring the dinner over here.

13:52.497 --> 13:55.466
That ain't gonna be
enough light, Edith.

14:03.207 --> 14:07.311
You ain't gonna be able
to see your guests
unless they smile at you.

14:11.883 --> 14:14.819
Well, we're going now.
Wait a minute !
What's this ?

14:14.886 --> 14:18.155

have you got on here ?

14:18.222 --> 14:20.658
Hot pants, daddy.
Don't you like 'em ?

14:20.725 --> 14:22.960
I like 'em.
I think they're sexy.

14:23.027 --> 14:27.731
Nobody's talking to you.
You got a case of
the permanent hots anyhow.

14:32.904 --> 14:36.039
You remind me
of Fanny tuhane
in them things.

14:36.107 --> 14:38.609
Fanny tuhane ?
Who's that ?

14:38.677 --> 14:40.845
She's a girl I used to know
when we was kids.

She'd show you her bloomers

to the ball game.

Get your ankle
in here, will ya ?
What do you got there ?

15:03.902 --> 15:06.971
Well, I figured out
it should be a hot compress.

15:07.038 --> 15:09.540
Cold is for headaches,
so hot is for sprains.

for that now.

Can't we talk about it
tomorrow, huh ?

15:47.412 --> 15:50.748
Would you just read this,
so I'm sure I got it down
the way you told me to ?

Oh, not bad...

what it seems to be here.
It ain't, huh ?

How come all the astronauts
are white ?
