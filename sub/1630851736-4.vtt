10:03.020 --> 10:06.815
I want to ask while America sort of adopts

10:06.815 --> 10:08.358
what's delicious around the world,

10:08.358 --> 10:11.195
breakfast has just been‐‐
‐ It's a laggard!

10:11.195 --> 10:13.989
It's slow to catch up! Why?
Slow, very slow.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.866
I actually don't think
Americans are even like...

10:15.866 --> 10:18.285
"Americans." We're all Americans. I ac‐‐
Are you though?

10:19.745 --> 10:22.456
‐ Show me your long‐form
birth certificate! Uh...

10:22.456 --> 10:24.541
Breakfast is about ritual.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.293
I gotta do this, this, and this.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.670
I take a shower in the morning.
I'm a morning showerer.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.547
I do this in the morning,
I do this in the morning

10:30.547 --> 10:34.760
because it's a fucking struggle
to get up and get going. So like

10:34.760 --> 10:38.138
morning is not the time for me
to introduce some new shit.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.974
‐ I will say this about
Taiwanese breakfast.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.560
It's the carb‐heaviest meal possible.
Oh my god.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.939
My problem is you eat
too much of it in your day's worth.

10:46.939 --> 10:50.651
‐ Well, let's be honest here. This is
majestic because it is a double starch.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.153
It is a fried cruller, a <i>youtiao</i>,

10:53.153 --> 10:54.696
wrapped in rice.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.074
‐ It's like a bread sandwich.
If you went to McDonald's,

10:57.074 --> 11:00.369
and they put a third bun and no other
things in the sandwich. That's it.

11:00.369 --> 11:03.705
<i>It's a good time
for the great taste of McDonald's!</i>

11:03.705 --> 11:06.416
People aren't making
this in the morning.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.919
‐ We're not.
‐ This is insane. What's in there?

11:08.919 --> 11:11.964
‐ I got the bún.
You got the bún,

11:11.964 --> 11:14.633
and I got a pork knuckle!
‐ Wow.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.803
‐ Bún, in general,
is one of the great bowls

11:17.803 --> 11:19.513
in the world.
So good.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.808
Noodle soups are so good in the morning.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.643
Yeah.
Why don't we have that...

11:24.643 --> 11:26.520
I don't understand.
‐ Think about how good that'd be

11:26.520 --> 11:29.481
on a New England morning.
You wake up in Maine,

11:29.481 --> 11:32.609
make yourself a bowl
of hot soba or hot pho.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.903
‐ Soba, to me, is

11:34.903 --> 11:36.572
the perfect breakfast food.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.157
Got some healthy carbs

11:39.157 --> 11:41.702
with the buckwheat stuff, light dashi.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.580
‐ It's got electrolytes. It's got protein.
Yeah. I mean...

11:46.248 --> 11:48.625
That just tastes like
you're gonna have a good day.

11:49.334 --> 11:52.004
<i>In the future, I want diversity,</i>

11:52.004 --> 11:54.214
<i>and I don't want my son
to grow up looking like</i>

11:54.214 --> 11:57.259
a weirdo when he's like,
"I want my noodle soup in the morning."

11:58.135 --> 11:59.511
<i>That, to me, is more sensible,</i>

11:59.511 --> 12:01.597
and it's so good!

13:10.123 --> 13:11.542
Hey!

13:11.542 --> 13:14.211
How you doing?
Good, thanks for coming.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.088
No problem. Thanks for having me.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.673
Have you been here before?

13:17.673 --> 13:20.467
‐ I have. I have one actually
in the Valley by my house.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.468
‐ Ah!

13:21.468 --> 13:23.428
‐ My daughter loves this place.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.973
‐ So, you know what to order?
‐ Little bit, you know.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.226
I mean, it's Snoop Dogg certified,
so you know it's good.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.526
<i>Sometimes, she can just glide to the rim.</i>

13:40.070 --> 13:42.406
<i>What a shot by Parker!</i>

13:42.406 --> 13:44.157
Part of me is just wondering

13:44.157 --> 13:46.785
is breakfast just sort
of an arbitrary thing?

13:46.785 --> 13:50.038
What would you say if I ordered
the bacon ranch cheese fries

13:50.038 --> 13:52.332
for breakfast, right?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.585
‐ I mean, it's a little heavy

13:54.585 --> 13:56.503
in the morning, but...

13:56.503 --> 13:59.256
My daughter and I one day, because I used
to be like, "You can't have grilled cheese

13:59.256 --> 14:01.216
for breakfast," and I looked at
myself and was like, why?

14:01.216 --> 14:03.760
You eat bread,

14:03.760 --> 14:05.387
and you eat cheese.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.472
Why can't you have
a grilled cheese for breakfast?

14:07.472 --> 14:09.975
‐ I'm feeling you here.
‐ It's like...

14:09.975 --> 14:11.268
‐ It's good!

14:11.268 --> 14:14.229
‐ Yeah, the D and C Grilled Cheese.
Done.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.608
What can I get you guys for breakfast?

14:17.608 --> 14:19.693
‐ I'm gonna go simple. I'm gonna go

14:19.693 --> 14:21.945
turkey sausage.
Turkey sausage.

14:21.945 --> 14:25.073
‐ And I'll just do like
a scrambled egg or... Yeah.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.867
‐ You know, I'm in season right now.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.495
So, I gotta sorta watch what I eat.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.664
I'm gonna go with

14:32.664 --> 14:34.458
a Denver omelet

14:34.458 --> 14:36.960
because I've never eaten
a Denver omelet in my life.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.003
Really?

14:40.130 --> 14:43.300
‐ And I think we might
split a grilled cheese.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.053
‐ Oh my gosh, you read my mind.
‐ Double the cheese, please.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.931
I really wanna order more,
but I'm in season. I'm in season.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.182
Yeah, yeah.

14:50.182 --> 14:52.768
<i>You've played ball in China,</i>

14:52.768 --> 14:55.771
<i>played ball in Turkey, and in Russia.</i>

14:55.771 --> 14:57.856
<i>Yes. The WNBA,</i>

14:57.856 --> 14:59.358
that's the summer job.

14:59.358 --> 15:02.903
How you feed your family and how you
take care of yourself is overseas.

15:02.903 --> 15:06.657
‐ I know when I travel,
sometimes I miss comforts of home.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.409
Almost no country has the same breakfast.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.037
‐ I didn't understand.
The first time I went overseas,

15:12.037 --> 15:13.997
I'll never forget,
I went and played a tournament in France.

15:13.997 --> 15:14.915
I was there for two weeks.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.042
We had a host family. We woke up,

15:17.042 --> 15:20.295
and they put a loaf of bread,

15:20.295 --> 15:22.673
which was bomb, on the table,

15:22.673 --> 15:25.259
and some jelly. And they were like,
"This is your breakfast."

15:25.259 --> 15:28.220
My friend and I, she was 6'2".

15:28.220 --> 15:31.515
I'm 6'4". We looked
at each other like, this?

15:31.515 --> 15:33.392
‐ But having spent time in France,

15:33.392 --> 15:35.310
breakfast is more like a cigarette,

15:35.310 --> 15:37.104
an espresso, and a croissant.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.106
And then a really heavy dinner.
‐ Yes.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.525
‐ 'Cause everyone seems
to be in shape in France.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.986
‐ It's so weird. I never see
French people work out,

15:43.986 --> 15:45.571
but I'm like, how
are you all in shape?

15:49.825 --> 15:50.951
‐ What's a Turkish breakfast?

15:50.951 --> 15:53.120
‐ Turkish breakfast isn't
too different. Like,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.205
<i>they'll do some eggs,</i>

15:55.205 --> 15:56.790
<i>but a lot of cold meats.</i>

15:56.790 --> 15:58.917
Russian breakfast is like

15:58.917 --> 16:00.961
cottage cheese. It's like...
Oh no.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.796
that type of... Mm.

16:03.589 --> 16:04.882
<i>Chinese breakfast</i>

16:04.882 --> 16:07.759
<i>is kind of the night before's dinner,</i>

16:07.759 --> 16:09.303
just like heated up.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.306
The thing I struggled with in China

16:12.306 --> 16:14.641
was there's not coffee.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.851
Like, they don't drink coffee.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.644
‐ Are you a coffee drinker?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.563
‐ Oh my gosh, yes. Like I said,

16:20.355 --> 16:22.191
post‐30, yes.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.985
I can't live without coffee now!

16:24.985 --> 16:26.987
I swear, my kid did it to me.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.698
‐ Me, too! I never drank
coffee before my son,

16:29.698 --> 16:32.159
and now, I drink four or five cups a day.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.581
<i>It is fuel.
At the end of the day, food is fuel.</i>

16:37.581 --> 16:39.875
I need that little edge.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.210
That edge is called coffee.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.630
<i>Coffee, to me, is masked</i>

16:44.630 --> 16:46.298
<i>in this whole breakfast equation.</i>

16:46.298 --> 16:48.342
<i>All coffee is</i>

16:48.342 --> 16:49.510
is low‐dose cocaine.

16:50.844 --> 16:51.845
‐ This is perfect!

16:55.057 --> 16:57.643
‐ Isn't it wild that people
drink coffee in America?

16:57.643 --> 17:00.103
It's antithetical to
everything we know, right?

17:00.103 --> 17:03.023
It's hot brown bitter bean water.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.317
But there's speed in it.
But there's speed in it.

17:06.318 --> 17:08.487
Do you like a single origin pour‐over...

17:08.487 --> 17:11.365
‐ I like it when someone
gives it to me. Instantly.

17:11.365 --> 17:14.952
But, I like coffee when it's delicious.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.995
I'm not saying I don't appreciate it.

17:16.995 --> 17:19.122
I just don't have the patience to make it.

17:19.122 --> 17:22.668
So, I have bought a lot of instant
coffee since Hugo was born.

17:22.668 --> 17:24.670
I'm gonna drink this like it's medicine.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.421
‐ Oh, come on.
You're not sitting by the windowsill

17:26.421 --> 17:28.006
just looking outside, logging the...

17:29.967 --> 17:32.302
Let me make you a cup of coffee.
Make me a cup of coffee.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.347
I'm gonna use the fancy stuff.
Vanilla caramel latte.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.641
A little candy bar there.
But that's not coffee,

17:37.641 --> 17:39.393
that's the powdered creamer stuff, right?

17:39.393 --> 17:41.645
‐ No, this is actually coffee.
You've never had this.

17:41.645 --> 17:44.398
I have never had this.
‐ You San Francisco elitist...

17:44.398 --> 17:45.941
‐ That's coffee?
‐ Yeah, dude!

17:45.941 --> 17:48.443
Right after maltodextrin,
it's instant coffee.

17:48.443 --> 17:51.196
There's actually instant coffee
in the instant coffee.

17:56.285 --> 17:59.663
Oh my god! That's so good!

17:59.663 --> 18:01.331
I'm gonna go with another scoop.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.417
Tell me this doesn't taste good!
‐ That's what I was gonna say.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.712
‐ It's like, do you hate chocolate milk?
This is just like chocolate milk!

18:06.712 --> 18:09.673
He's about to do a depth charge!

18:09.673 --> 18:12.009
I don't see coffee. I see...

18:12.009 --> 18:13.135
power.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.723
‐ The extra little bump makes it
'cause now it tastes‐‐

18:17.723 --> 18:20.350
‐ Now, it tastes like something
a child <i>wouldn't</i> wanna drink.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.146
You know what the best
part about this is, Dave?

18:24.146 --> 18:25.397
‐ Ah!

18:25.397 --> 18:28.650
‐ Occasionally, you get an undissolved
grain that gives a little crunch.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.117
‐ When you think about coffee,
it's about being more productive.

18:38.035 --> 18:41.079
<i>I would love to know when
coffee became a thing in history</i>

18:41.079 --> 18:43.665
<i>because I guarantee you it
probably coincides with,</i>

18:43.665 --> 18:46.502
like, the Industrial Revolution
and all these things

18:46.502 --> 18:49.796
'cause, listen, gives you fucking energy.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.757
<i>Let me pause there for a minute, Dave.</i>

18:51.757 --> 18:54.218
<i>So, coffee doesn't
exactly give you energy.</i>

18:54.218 --> 18:56.178
<i>It's a stimulant,</i>

18:56.178 --> 18:59.097
<i>meaning it increases the activity
in your central nervous system,</i>

18:59.097 --> 19:01.308
<i>giving you the sensation
of being energized.</i>

19:01.308 --> 19:03.185
<i>Heightening alertness, responsiveness,</i>

19:03.185 --> 19:05.354
<i>and firing you up to take on
the whole goddamn world.</i>

19:05.354 --> 19:06.563
‐ Duke it out! Hit him!

19:06.563 --> 19:08.232
‐ Get the fuck off of me!

19:08.815 --> 19:10.484
<i>That, and making you have to pee.</i>

19:10.484 --> 19:12.486
<i>So, while my computer systems
don't allow me</i>

19:12.486 --> 19:15.072
<i>to enjoy the beverage,
I'm gonna run a simulation</i>

19:15.072 --> 19:16.823
<i>where I have six shots of espresso,</i>

19:16.823 --> 19:19.451
<i>and then explain the entire
history of coffee in 25 seconds.</i>

19:23.872 --> 19:26.291
<i>Where's coffee actually from?
Ethiopia. Soon after its discovery,</i>

19:26.291 --> 19:28.085
<i>coffee spread throughout
the Arab world through trade.</i>

19:28.085 --> 19:30.337
<i>Eventually, it made its way to Europe,
where people like Bach would drink</i>

19:30.337 --> 19:31.547
<i>over 30 cups a day
and write music like this.</i>

19:31.547 --> 19:33.048
‐ <i>I do love coffee so!</i>

19:33.048 --> 19:34.967
<i>Coffee made its way to
a little place called America,</i>

19:34.967 --> 19:37.094
<i>where if you recall your textbooks,
the Boston Tea Party happened</i>

19:37.094 --> 19:39.221
<i>because tea is for English dandies,
and what happened after that?</i>

19:39.221 --> 19:40.973
<i>Coffee took over.
To drink coffee was to be American.</i>

19:40.973 --> 19:42.808
<i>Thomas Jefferson drank coffee.
Paul Revere drank coffee.</i>

19:42.808 --> 19:44.476
<i>Why do you think he rode
so fast through the night?</i>

19:44.476 --> 19:46.353
<i>Teddy Roosevelt, David Lynch,
Jerry Seinfeld, Ariana Grande, Tay Tay...</i>

19:46.353 --> 19:47.771
<i>Ow.</i>

19:47.771 --> 19:51.108
<i>Maybe I'll run my smoothie simulation.
Little quick pick‐me‐up.</i>

19:53.569 --> 19:56.697
<i>Wow, that was delicious.
And I feel fantastic!</i>

19:56.697 --> 20:00.117
<i>Like most drugs,
coffee is better when used in moderation.</i>

20:00.117 --> 20:02.578
<i>And don't let Dave push
that speed water on you.</i>

20:02.578 --> 20:06.123
<i>There are other ways to get energy in
the morning without low‐dose cocaine.</i>

20:06.123 --> 20:07.291
‐ Let's start with breakfast.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.750
‐ I eat a smoothie most of the time

20:08.750 --> 20:10.752
<i>with some seeds and some nuts,</i>

20:10.752 --> 20:12.921
some electrolytes, some protein powder.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.840
‐ Can you get bacon into a smoothie?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.925
‐ You probably could.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.890
<i>The idea of health, that's, I guess,</i>

20:22.890 --> 20:25.434
<i>the biggest problem is breakfast
is also synonymous with health.</i>

20:27.477 --> 20:29.730
It's pretty good.
‐ I know.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.442
It's just another...

20:33.442 --> 20:36.862
unnecessary marketing structure

20:36.862 --> 20:38.697
just to sell new things.

20:38.697 --> 20:41.700
<i>It's not about optimizing
how delicious it can be.</i>

20:42.492 --> 20:45.454
Even now, people eating
hard‐boiled eggs, why?

20:45.454 --> 20:47.372
Hard boiled egg's the worst fucking egg!

20:47.372 --> 20:50.375
I mean, honestly, I just wanna know
what you're supposed to do.

20:51.335 --> 20:54.379
<i>Nice try, Dave, but I'm not
gonna do your homework for you.</i>

20:54.379 --> 20:57.841
<i>But I do sense you're overwhelmed
by what's being sold as healthy.</i>

20:57.841 --> 21:01.470
<i>If you're gonna customize your breakfast,
you might as well eat what's good for you.</i>

21:01.470 --> 21:03.472
<i>But given the breakfast
industry's track record,</i>

21:03.472 --> 21:06.433
<i>how can you know for sure that
what you're eating is actually healthy?</i>

21:07.601 --> 21:10.604
<i>Luckily, there are scientists
working on this exact dilemma.</i>

21:11.855 --> 21:14.566
‐ We anticipate that at some point,

21:14.566 --> 21:17.861
there will be a home device
that will be as small

21:17.861 --> 21:20.405
<i>as a flash drive that reads DNA code.</i>

21:20.405 --> 21:23.450
<i>And somebody would be able to read out</i>

21:23.450 --> 21:26.537
<i>not only our tags,
but also every ingredient</i>

21:26.537 --> 21:29.748
<i>and know the quality and nutrition</i>

21:29.748 --> 21:32.459
<i>or has it been contaminated
with something.</i>

21:32.459 --> 21:35.587
<i>What Dr. Jorgensen is implying
is that within your lifetime,</i>

21:35.587 --> 21:37.256
<i>you'll be able to go down
to the grocery store,</i>

21:37.256 --> 21:38.882
<i>scan a piece of produce,</i>

21:38.882 --> 21:40.759
<i>and know exactly where
and how it was grown,</i>

21:40.759 --> 21:42.511
<i>what chemicals were used,</i>

21:42.511 --> 21:44.513
<i>and what its exact nutritional value is.</i>

21:44.513 --> 21:46.348
<i>Think of it as empowerment,</i>

21:46.348 --> 21:49.852
and I just wanna know. I wanna know
everything about what I'm eating.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.397
<i>That's interesting,
though there are exceptions.</i>

21:53.397 --> 21:55.190
<i>Like, you definitely
don't wanna know what's in</i>

21:55.190 --> 21:57.943
<i>the scattered smothered covered
chunk top dice hash browns</i>

21:57.943 --> 21:59.278
<i>at Waffle House.</i>

21:59.278 --> 22:01.572
<i>But with new technology,
you can apply that level</i>

22:01.572 --> 22:03.907
<i>of customization to healthier foods.</i>

22:03.907 --> 22:06.243
‐ DNA helped family trees bloom,

22:06.243 --> 22:10.038
but could it also maybe give you a genetic
blueprint to help you lose weight

22:10.038 --> 22:12.666
<i>based on your own biology?</i>

22:12.666 --> 22:14.209
<i>Enter nutrigenomics,</i>

22:14.209 --> 22:16.420
<i>the study of nutrition in genes.</i>

22:16.420 --> 22:17.629
<i>In nutrigenomics,</i>

22:17.629 --> 22:19.923
looking at different variants

22:19.923 --> 22:22.509
in our genes, in our DNA,

22:22.509 --> 22:25.596
to see how we metabolize

22:25.596 --> 22:28.182
and absorb and utilize

22:28.182 --> 22:30.225
different nutrients in different ways.

22:30.225 --> 22:32.144
This is a way to personalize

22:32.144 --> 22:34.479
your breakfast foods.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.356
‐ Well, we've both taken the test.

22:36.356 --> 22:39.359
‐ Yep, we have.
‐ I'm now super nervous.

22:39.359 --> 22:42.654
‐ Listen,
when I saw the big pamphlet,

22:42.654 --> 22:44.948
what did I say? I said, "Oh lord."

22:44.948 --> 22:46.575
‐ This is like getting into
college or something.

22:46.575 --> 22:49.077
This is the one time
you want the thin letter.

22:49.077 --> 22:52.331
‐ But it's full of super
valuable information

22:52.331 --> 22:54.708
about your unique

22:54.708 --> 22:56.585
health markers.

22:56.585 --> 22:59.171
‐ Is this something that every athlete
is going to do moving forward?

22:59.171 --> 23:00.547
I think so.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.050
When you're trying to
get someone to change

23:03.050 --> 23:05.511
their eating habits, and they have

23:05.511 --> 23:08.263
become multimillionaires

23:08.263 --> 23:10.390
off of what they had been eating,

23:10.390 --> 23:12.351
which is probably some Froot Loops

23:12.351 --> 23:14.686
or some type of sugary cereal,

23:14.686 --> 23:16.480
and here it is,
you're coming in and saying,

23:16.480 --> 23:18.607
"You need to have this
for breakfast in the morning."

23:18.607 --> 23:20.234
They tend not to listen.

23:20.234 --> 23:23.362
But, unfortunately, because of injuries,

23:23.362 --> 23:24.905
they say, "Hey,

23:24.905 --> 23:26.990
what can I have for breakfast
to help me out?"

23:26.990 --> 23:29.535
‐ If it's good for athletes,
probably good for...

23:30.410 --> 23:31.495
average person.

23:31.495 --> 23:34.498
‐ Now, I'm getting all different
kinds of people that

23:34.498 --> 23:37.709
want to do nutrigenomics, DNA tests,

23:37.709 --> 23:40.587
even someone who's working
from home right now

23:40.587 --> 23:43.465
who just wants to optimize their health.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.218
This is much greater personalization.

23:46.218 --> 23:48.720
Alright, should we take
a look at your results?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.180
Okay.
‐ Okay.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.474
That one's for you.
Alright.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.017
You know, one of the things

23:54.017 --> 23:56.979
that I thought was really interesting
about both of your results,

23:56.979 --> 23:59.273
and this is actually
a similarity that you have,

23:59.273 --> 24:00.858
so I think this could be‐‐

24:00.858 --> 24:02.734
‐ Too much salt.

24:02.734 --> 24:03.735
‐ How did you know?

24:03.735 --> 24:07.114
‐ Because he knows how to cook,
and he cooks very well.

24:07.114 --> 24:09.074
Exactly.

24:09.074 --> 24:12.411
Mine's like 18,000!
And it should be

24:12.411 --> 24:14.329
less than 1,500.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.415
So, Dave,

24:16.415 --> 24:19.251
I do wanna say this is
the highest sodium intake

24:19.251 --> 24:22.504
I've ever seen in my entire career.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.591
That's a lot.
‐ That's a lot.

24:25.591 --> 24:27.050
That is a lot.
‐ Yeah.

24:27.050 --> 24:29.303
‐ Some of these fresh foods,

24:29.303 --> 24:31.763
like the whole fruits,
the whole vegetables,

24:31.763 --> 24:33.807
some of the nuts and seeds, can actually

24:33.807 --> 24:36.894
counteract the effects
of eating a lot of salt.

24:36.894 --> 24:40.314
So, things like potassium
and magnesium and calcium

24:40.314 --> 24:43.650
were some of the things that I actually
put in both of your smoothies.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.110
‐ I'm gonna go ahead and taste it.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.321
‐ That is custom‐made for your genes.

24:47.321 --> 24:50.324
You have an enhanced ability

24:50.324 --> 24:52.409
to sense fats.

24:52.409 --> 24:55.204
‐ Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
‐ Where is mine? What does mine say?

24:55.204 --> 24:58.207
Yours is... Yours is...

24:58.207 --> 25:00.250
also enhanced.
‐ There you go!

25:00.250 --> 25:02.794
I need fat! Trying to tell you now!
Yeah!

25:02.794 --> 25:06.131
I'm sure this is the first time you
met two individuals like, "Yeah!"

25:06.131 --> 25:07.508
‐ Yes, for the fat!

25:07.508 --> 25:10.260
Cheers! To the fat!
That's great.

25:16.308 --> 25:18.936
I think if you step back and you
look at how we eat breakfast,

25:18.936 --> 25:20.521
it'll show you that the gatekeepers,

25:20.521 --> 25:22.689
<i>they don't want change to happen,</i>

25:22.689 --> 25:25.943
<i>and it's a slow adoption
of anything that's new.</i>

25:27.236 --> 25:30.697
If you try to stack together
the best foods

25:30.697 --> 25:33.075
for breakfast around the world,

25:33.075 --> 25:35.369
what does America have?

25:35.369 --> 25:36.411
Seriously.

25:37.162 --> 25:40.165
<i>Who the hell is telling me that breakfast
has to be this kind of food</i>

25:40.165 --> 25:42.334
<i>and lunch has to be this kind of food?</i>

25:42.334 --> 25:43.752
<i>In the future,</i>

25:43.752 --> 25:45.712
it should be it's a free‐for‐all.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.339
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.633
‐ Melted butter's here.
We have melted butter?

25:50.634 --> 25:53.595
Here's the flour!
Dan bing is the classic

25:53.595 --> 25:56.348
Chinese breakfast street food.
It's an inverse crepe.

25:56.348 --> 25:58.934
When I first saw it, I ordered one.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.853
They cracked the egg
on this giant griddle,

26:00.853 --> 26:04.147
and then you put the crepe
over the egg, which is also

26:04.147 --> 26:06.525
completely contrary to everything we know.
When I first saw that,

26:06.525 --> 26:08.443
I was like, what is happening?

26:11.238 --> 26:14.700
For how many different ways
we like to express our individuality,

26:14.700 --> 26:18.036
none of that is truly expressed
in American breakfast.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.788
<i>I don't want people to feel vilified</i>

26:19.788 --> 26:21.415
<i>for having the things that they like.</i>

26:21.415 --> 26:23.208
<i>I think it is useful</i>

26:23.208 --> 26:24.710
to begin to interrogate

26:24.710 --> 26:28.380
what customs are we protecting
that we may not even realize,

26:28.380 --> 26:30.382
and what does that mean about us

26:30.382 --> 26:33.260
and do we still want to be
that when we figure it out?

26:33.260 --> 26:35.095
I didn't tell my friends about this

26:35.095 --> 26:37.014
for years because I was
embarrassed about pork floss.

26:37.014 --> 26:39.474
I don't even know how to
explain pork floss to people.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.144
If you desiccate pork jerky,
that's what you get.

26:42.144 --> 26:44.396
‐ The texture's a little crunchy,
but it's like...

26:44.396 --> 26:46.273
‐ White people aren't gonna eat it.
Let's just be honest.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.904
<i>This is what we think
is delicious breakfast.</i>

26:51.904 --> 26:54.239
Is there any hope to break the wheel?

26:54.239 --> 26:56.325
‐ I do think the way in is this

26:56.325 --> 26:58.702
Saturday Sunday, weekend brunch.

26:58.702 --> 27:01.663
<i>We got dim sum. Our foot's in the door.
Maybe it breaks through</i>

27:01.663 --> 27:02.789
to the rest of the week somehow.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.666
My favorite kind of ham.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.461
Perfect rectangle,
just how the pig makes it.

27:08.462 --> 27:10.756
‐ My daughter's been
around for the ride with me.

27:10.756 --> 27:14.468
We've lived all around the world,
and my main thing with her is try it.

27:15.469 --> 27:17.304
And there are so many times

27:17.304 --> 27:20.057
where she tries it
and absolutely falls in love with it.

27:21.517 --> 27:23.602
<i>My priority on this, for both your kids</i>

27:23.602 --> 27:25.896
<i>and mine,</i>

27:25.896 --> 27:28.106
<i>is that when they go to
Paris for the first time,</i>

27:28.106 --> 27:30.442
and they see the crepe being made,

27:30.442 --> 27:33.153
and there's Nutella or whatever
fucking shit they put in it,

27:33.153 --> 27:35.948
and they're like,
"Dude, this dan bing is so weird.

27:35.948 --> 27:37.866
They put chocolate in it."

27:37.866 --> 27:39.618
‐ "Where's the pork floss?"
Yeah.

27:39.618 --> 27:42.788
It shows the power of how
we can be stuck in our ways.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.375
<i>You can always get acclimated</i>

27:46.375 --> 27:48.669
<i>and not realize that
you're sort of in a bubble.</i>

27:49.962 --> 27:52.798
Breakfast seems to be this
perfect opportunity to change it up.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.553
‐ How is it?
‐ It's really good.

27:58.303 --> 28:00.639
<i>I think we have to start there, right?</i>

28:00.639 --> 28:02.474
<i>You're not gonna see</i>

28:02.474 --> 28:05.853
glamorized in a commercial,

28:05.853 --> 28:08.063
some beautiful kid

28:08.063 --> 28:10.023
eating pho for breakfast!

28:10.023 --> 28:11.817
You're just not gonna get there!

28:14.027 --> 28:16.405
‐ Tommy, it's time for breakfast.

28:16.405 --> 28:19.157
How about some cereal?
‐ Bo‐wing.

28:19.157 --> 28:21.285
‐ How about your favorite pancake?
‐ Again?

28:21.285 --> 28:23.203
How about pho?

28:23.203 --> 28:24.663
‐ Holy smokes! It's...

28:24.663 --> 28:26.164
Wait, who are you?

28:26.164 --> 28:30.085
PHO‐I'm Pho‐Man, here to provide
a breakfast that doesn't suck!

28:30.085 --> 28:31.587
‐ How'd you fit through that door?

28:31.587 --> 28:35.257
‐ Wow!
PHO‐Pho‐get about it!

28:36.508 --> 28:38.302
‐ Now that's umami!

28:38.302 --> 28:41.054
‐ Umami... Isn't that David Chang's thing?

28:42.931 --> 28:46.059
Wow! Thanks, Pho‐Man!
Breakfast is forever changed.

28:46.059 --> 28:49.062
♪ dance music ♪

28:49.813 --> 28:51.148
‐
<i>This is so cool.</i>

28:51.148 --> 28:53.233
<i>Pho Power. An important
part of this balanced breakfast.</i>

28:57.279 --> 28:58.739
Have you been here before?

28:58.739 --> 29:00.949
‐ You know what,
this used to be a dentist's office.

29:00.949 --> 29:03.911
‐ What do you like to order? What's your
breakfast? I mean, you love breakfast.

29:03.911 --> 29:05.871
That's the best meal of the day.

29:05.871 --> 29:07.581
And I always get a half order of nachos.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.043
<i>You got tortillas,</i>

29:11.043 --> 29:12.586
<i>you got cheese,</i>

29:12.586 --> 29:14.171
<i>you got pork,</i>

29:14.171 --> 29:15.964
<i>two eggs over easy on top.</i>

29:16.757 --> 29:18.258
The two eggs make it breakfast.

29:18.258 --> 29:20.844
‐ I like that. It's a very simple law.
You add two eggs, it's breakfast.

29:20.844 --> 29:21.470
‐ Oh yeah.

29:21.470 --> 29:24.139
‐ It was staring me right in the face,
and I never saw that.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.225
‐ Whatever it is! Spaghetti,
put two eggs. Don't matter.

29:27.684 --> 29:29.269
It's an Italian breakfast.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.854
Nachos...
‐ Great!

29:31.647 --> 29:33.357
This is breakfast now.

29:33.357 --> 29:35.359
‐ Hell yeah! Got egg!

29:38.237 --> 29:40.864
Mm, that's good.
