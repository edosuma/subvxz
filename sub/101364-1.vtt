WEBVTT

02:16.619 --> 02:18.222
Is it done?

02:18.255 --> 02:19.123
Yeah, just in time.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.591
Well done.

02:21.624 --> 02:23.560
And we've tested?

02:23.593 --> 02:25.795
I mean, it works in theory,

02:25.829 --> 02:27.865
but I'm not sure
if it's gonna work

02:27.898 --> 02:30.134
in the real world with this.

02:31.135 --> 02:34.872
I mean the design may may
seem a little sketchy,

02:34.905 --> 02:37.141
but it has to work fine.

02:37.174 --> 02:39.010
Not to look fine after.

02:39.043 --> 02:40.177
Good point, I suppose.

02:49.153 --> 02:52.056
The frequency
acquitted universe.

02:54.691 --> 02:56.593
Just a random sentence.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.596
Let me just get out of the way.

03:00.697 --> 03:03.234
Hey, nice graphics by the way.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.937
Thanks, it's a template
for a video game design.

03:10.074 --> 03:10.908
Do it.

03:14.311 --> 03:15.545
Can you hear that?

03:17.847 --> 03:18.782
It's working!

03:22.219 --> 03:24.121
Five seconds to stabilization.

03:26.190 --> 03:27.590
Three, two, one

03:31.128 --> 03:32.129
Oh, come on.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.866
What happened?

03:35.900 --> 03:36.699
It's restarting.

03:36.733 --> 03:37.634
Restarting?

03:37.667 --> 03:39.636
Yeah, the fields still growing.

03:39.669 --> 03:41.138
It doesn't make any sense.

03:41.172 --> 03:42.073
Stop it.

03:44.375 --> 03:45.209
It's not responding dad.

03:45.242 --> 03:46.343
I think we've got a
mechanical problem.

03:46.377 --> 03:47.811
Mechanical.

03:47.844 --> 03:49.813
You mean, something is
wrong with a machine

03:49.846 --> 03:51.315
and now we're here
for more hours.

03:51.348 --> 03:53.817
Yeah, I mean, I've been
checking the maths all day.

03:53.851 --> 03:54.985
Alright.

03:55.019 --> 03:56.053
It's always my fault.

03:57.254 --> 04:00.091
I guess something is
wrong with the engine.

04:00.124 --> 04:01.992
Lets just unplug it,
we'll start again.

04:02.026 --> 04:03.894
Yeah, we can try it.

04:03.928 --> 04:06.397
But first we have
a toast with me.

04:06.430 --> 04:07.398
A toast to what dad,

04:07.431 --> 04:09.133
I mean the test failed.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.102
It doesn't matter

04:11.135 --> 04:14.737
We got the firmware but it
doesn't demonstrate anything yet,

04:14.771 --> 04:19.142
but it proves that I wasn't
crazy trying after all.

04:20.444 --> 04:23.347
I'm not sure how its
to not being crazy.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.647
Raise your glass.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.254
This is for us.

04:34.391 --> 04:36.193
We make a great team son.

04:38.996 --> 04:40.297
Dad, is that a pig?

04:40.331 --> 04:42.199
Mamamia, get hold of it, quick.

04:43.134 --> 04:46.303
Well, this is inappropriate
for a research lab.

04:46.337 --> 04:47.104
And he wonders why
he doesn't get any

04:47.138 --> 04:49.273
extra funding from
the university

04:50.407 --> 04:52.176
or another assistant
for that matter.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.379
I swear I have nothing
to do with this.

04:55.412 --> 04:57.847
Why did he follow you then?

04:57.882 --> 04:59.816
Cheecha, how did
you get in here?

04:59.849 --> 05:01.385
Oh, he has a name now?

05:01.418 --> 05:04.687
Of course, he's a
fancy new

05:04.721 --> 05:05.722
He's cute.

05:08.459 --> 05:11.896
Would you take it back
to the padric a minute,

05:11.929 --> 05:13.063
please.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.965
That's the last
thing we need around.

05:14.999 --> 05:15.900
No problem boss.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.310
Oh, you don't
belong here, do you?

06:34.878 --> 06:36.413
That makes two of us.

06:37.581 --> 06:39.149
This isn't your pig, is it dad?

06:47.824 --> 06:51.428
♪ And in our lap we had a pig ♪

06:51.462 --> 06:54.265
♪ Nobody knew why ♪

06:54.298 --> 06:57.434
♪ With a here
and a there ♪

06:57.468 --> 06:58.302
God.

07:01.905 --> 07:02.873
That scare you too?

07:08.512 --> 07:11.181
What were you doing
out there dad?

07:11.215 --> 07:12.483
Never mind.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.151
Why is he still here?

07:15.919 --> 07:17.855
I don't think its Cheecha so.

07:17.888 --> 07:20.457
Looks like Cheecha to me.

07:20.491 --> 07:22.960
Maybe he has a brother who
doesn't wear a collar then.

07:22.993 --> 07:23.927
A collar.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.167
Put him in here.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.036
I'm going to take
care of him later.

07:32.069 --> 07:32.870
Come on.

07:38.976 --> 07:40.077
Are you worried?

07:40.110 --> 07:42.413
What if it can be fixed?

07:42.446 --> 07:44.948
If the test was wrong,
it's simply wrong,

07:44.982 --> 07:47.985
And I waste my life on this.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.488
Why would you say that now?

07:51.522 --> 07:53.857
We're close, you've never
questioned the theory before.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.426
Let's just switch off

07:55.459 --> 07:56.860
and we'll fix it.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.096
No actually it's better
if we leave it on.

07:59.997 --> 08:02.633
Could help expose the flaw.

08:02.666 --> 08:05.869
Makes sense, what
can I do to help?

08:05.903 --> 08:07.037
If you don't mind,

08:07.071 --> 08:09.006
I'd like to double
check everything alone.

08:11.375 --> 08:12.176
Alone?

08:12.209 --> 08:14.912
Yeah, what's the harm?

08:14.945 --> 08:17.648
You could go to Marius
and play the lotto for me,

08:17.681 --> 08:19.383
while I deal with this.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.984
Are you serious?

08:21.018 --> 08:22.986
I feel like we've got
some lucky numbers.

08:24.154 --> 08:25.956
No dad, you're up to something

08:25.989 --> 08:27.558
All of a sudden you
just want to check alone

08:27.591 --> 08:29.326
like you don't trust my work.

08:31.195 --> 08:34.164
Everything has always
to be about you.

08:34.198 --> 08:36.500
But now you're just
thinking about gambling.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.035
I don't understand you.

08:39.068 --> 08:42.339
You should be thrilled
to take a break.

08:42.373 --> 08:45.476
Hang some time out over here.

08:45.509 --> 08:46.643
Catch your girlfriend.

08:46.677 --> 08:48.011
I don't have a girlfriend.

08:48.045 --> 08:50.147
Whatever you call that girl.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.916
The lotto is a not gambling,

08:52.950 --> 08:57.054
the lotto is a tradition,
an Italian tradition.

08:57.087 --> 08:59.056
Okay, now take it, go.

09:00.257 --> 09:01.892
Fine, I'll take it.

09:05.596 --> 09:07.364
Actually dad, if
you do trust me,

09:08.966 --> 09:11.268
then surely you won't
mind me taking the Vespa.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.469
Vespa,

09:12.503 --> 09:14.138
since when do you care?

09:14.171 --> 09:17.207
If you don't trust me
to ride it, then fine.

09:17.241 --> 09:21.378
Of course I do, but
Vespa is a collectible,

09:21.412 --> 09:24.348
a relic from the time
I met your mother.

09:24.381 --> 09:27.351
and you know what I think about
letting it out of the farm.

09:30.154 --> 09:32.556
Oh, well, she looks brand new.

09:32.589 --> 09:34.024
Go ahead,

09:34.057 --> 09:36.093
before I have a second thoughts.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.329
Don't drive it in the dirt.

09:40.297 --> 09:42.499
Don't leave it unattended.

09:42.533 --> 09:43.367
All right dad.

09:45.002 --> 09:49.206
Try not scratching it, go
go, get out of here, go!

09:53.110 --> 09:55.179
Remember to keep to the right!

10:27.144 --> 10:28.011
Ciao boy.

10:35.686 --> 10:36.720
Oops, sorry!

12:02.272 --> 12:03.373
Ricky?

12:03.407 --> 12:04.408
Ciao.

12:04.441 --> 12:06.310
Where did you get it?

12:06.343 --> 12:07.511
Its my dad's actually.

12:07.544 --> 12:08.880
He restored it with
his own two hands.

12:08.913 --> 12:10.747
I didn't know the
professor had such service.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.250
Is very cute to to
let you ride it.

12:13.283 --> 12:16.353
Oh, this is the first time
he's ever let me touch it.

12:16.386 --> 12:18.488
He's quite precious
with his possessions.

12:21.191 --> 12:22.259
That'll be him now.

12:22.292 --> 12:25.095
He's probably check to see
if I crashed it or not.

12:26.563 --> 12:28.165
Dad what is it?

12:28.198 --> 12:28.832
Oh, okay.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.402
This is the lab mascot Cheecha.

12:32.436 --> 12:33.303
Oh, so cute.

12:34.939 --> 12:36.306
Dad, I'm not on my own.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.608
Sorry guys,

12:37.641 --> 12:39.343
I didn't mean to interrupt.

12:39.376 --> 12:40.344
Ciao Olivia

12:41.445 --> 12:42.914
I was just kidding around.

12:42.947 --> 12:43.915
Take care of my Vespa.

12:43.948 --> 12:46.516
Yeah, okay bye.

12:47.952 --> 12:49.486
Was it the?

12:49.519 --> 12:52.356
I don't know, even for my
dad, that was quite weird.

12:52.389 --> 12:56.727
So, Olivia, do you
want to maybe get some

12:56.760 --> 12:59.262
gelato later or something?

12:59.296 --> 12:59.897
Olivia.

13:01.498 --> 13:03.400
I can't leave right now.

13:03.433 --> 13:04.601
Roco needs me here.

13:05.937 --> 13:07.304
Always seem to catch
you at the wrong time.

13:07.337 --> 13:08.338
Maybe later?

13:08.372 --> 13:10.474
Yeah, yeah, well I can swing by

13:10.507 --> 13:12.142
on the way home or something.

13:14.912 --> 13:15.746
Ciao.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.389
What's that?

14:34.892 --> 14:36.660
Wow, that is a coffee.

14:38.595 --> 14:40.597
Anything else I can
do for you Nicki?

14:40.630 --> 14:43.000
I've always
enjoyed the show.

14:43.034 --> 14:45.702
Five lucky numbers for you.

14:45.736 --> 14:47.972
I saw very funny
things last night,

14:48.005 --> 14:49.639
Excuse me,

14:49.673 --> 14:51.842
I suppose picking the
number out of dysmorphia.

14:51.876 --> 14:53.911
I don't know what that is.

14:53.945 --> 14:58.782
Dysmorphia, the
numbers, Nicola, gracia.

15:01.518 --> 15:04.021
So, I have a drink one night,

15:04.055 --> 15:06.556
for something unusual

15:06.590 --> 15:09.726
You looked up here and
find the winning numbers.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.728
If it's fate.

15:11.762 --> 15:14.364
That seems a little
superstitious to my dad, no,

15:15.766 --> 15:18.769
He personally believes
he wants to make the four

15:18.802 --> 15:20.771
Which stands for, the pig.

15:24.674 --> 15:25.509
That makes sense.

15:25.542 --> 15:26.643
A pig turned up at
the lab yesterday.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.713
See, you must think its a sign,

15:29.746 --> 15:31.348
Then 23, the idiot.

15:35.719 --> 15:37.788
The idiot, he means me.

15:40.925 --> 15:42.292
Its the Vespa.

15:46.463 --> 15:47.297
Hey, hey!

15:48.532 --> 15:49.366
Shit.

15:52.870 --> 15:53.703
Come on.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.540
Come on.

15:59.810 --> 16:01.778
You're right

16:01.812 --> 16:03.881
Yeah, sorry, if we met before,

16:03.915 --> 16:04.982
you know my dad,

16:05.016 --> 16:06.984
I know everything about him.

16:07.018 --> 16:08.552
His story, his work,

16:08.585 --> 16:10.821
and most importantly,
I know he's not crazy.

16:10.855 --> 16:11.755
Well, that's good.

16:11.788 --> 16:12.823
He's built quite a
reputation around here

16:12.857 --> 16:14.025
for the opposite so.

16:16.861 --> 16:19.362
I understood your
bike has been stolen.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.666
Yeah, yeah, it's a
it's an old bike.

16:22.699 --> 16:24.401
It's got high sentimental value.

16:24.434 --> 16:25.802
Let me give you a ride home.

16:25.836 --> 16:27.571
I'd love learning more
about your research,

16:27.604 --> 16:28.505
if you don't mind.

16:30.007 --> 16:31.408
You're not journalist are you?

16:31.441 --> 16:32.910
No I'm not a journalist.

16:32.944 --> 16:34.845
I'm Dr. Celestin Dissue.

16:34.879 --> 16:36.813
I work with the university.

16:37.915 --> 16:38.715
Ricky.

16:55.066 --> 16:56.499
I actually owe you an apology,

16:56.533 --> 16:58.069
I nearly caused you
a crush earlier.

16:58.102 --> 16:59.436
The bike?

16:59.469 --> 17:00.503
That was you?

17:00.537 --> 17:01.939
Yeah.

17:01.973 --> 17:04.075
Caused me nothing but trouble
since I brought it out.

17:04.108 --> 17:06.944
You're afraid your father
is going to be upset,

17:06.978 --> 17:09.579
Upset, no, no, I'm
afraid he's gonna be mad.

17:11.983 --> 17:14.919
I have a straightforward
question, if you don't mind.

17:14.952 --> 17:17.922
Yeah, sure, I'm sorry,
here its on the left

17:19.924 --> 17:21.893
Well, how can you be so sure

17:21.925 --> 17:25.795
that's such a disputed thing
as the ether actually exists?

17:26.998 --> 17:28.698
If even Tesla himself couldn't

17:28.732 --> 17:31.035
suggest any possible
demonstrations?

17:33.004 --> 17:34.671
I don't know.

17:34.704 --> 17:36.740
I can't speak to my father, I
mean, his methods with them.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.443
I never really understood
them, I wish.

17:43.713 --> 17:46.918
I don't know, maybe he's
just too idealistic for me.

17:46.951 --> 17:49.153
You are saying you don't
think he can make it?

17:49.186 --> 17:51.755
No, no, of course I
do, I just I think,

17:52.924 --> 17:53.891
Well, I mean,

17:54.758 --> 17:55.927
it doesn't matter anyway.

17:55.960 --> 17:56.928
I'm pursuing a
university career.

17:56.961 --> 17:59.864
So I'm going to have 25
years of published works

17:59.897 --> 18:02.632
and methods and projects
and probably failures,

18:02.666 --> 18:04.701
but I mean, it won't matter.

18:04.734 --> 18:07.671
I'm gonna have electric chair
back in London either way.

18:07.704 --> 18:09.506
I see you have it
all figured out.

18:10.607 --> 18:13.110
Yeah, I've understood
forward thinker.

18:13.144 --> 18:14.577
Thanks for the ride.

18:14.611 --> 18:16.780
Well, I wish you all the
best luck in the world.

18:18.149 --> 18:19.116
Thanks.

18:19.150 --> 18:21.152
It was nice to meet you.

18:57.587 --> 19:00.091
Dad, you haven't fixed it yet?

19:02.927 --> 19:06.097
One should never give
his time for granted.

19:07.932 --> 19:11.801
I was your age when I
started this project.

19:11.835 --> 19:14.171
I was just like you,

19:14.205 --> 19:17.540
a young ambitious
career scientist.

19:21.045 --> 19:23.247
I was also a
dreamer, an ambition.

19:25.282 --> 19:27.684
Dad I've got
something to tell you,

19:27.717 --> 19:30.187
you're probably
not going to like,

19:30.221 --> 19:33.623
People admire me for my
commitment, my patience...

19:35.592 --> 19:37.694
Its about the Vespa.

19:39.763 --> 19:43.833
Some years went by, and I
want to publish any paper

19:45.136 --> 19:46.137
my reputation.

19:48.339 --> 19:53.543
You know, they began to
wonder if I was delusional,

19:54.311 --> 19:56.280
rather than a genius.

19:59.216 --> 20:00.583
The scientific community,

20:01.718 --> 20:04.321
pushed me away, moved on,

20:04.355 --> 20:07.624
and you know where I'd be then..

20:07.657 --> 20:10.294
Yeah left us in London
and retired here.

20:10.327 --> 20:11.962
I didn't get my project done.

20:11.996 --> 20:13.596
That's what I did.

20:15.933 --> 20:18.335
never never stepped off track.

20:20.204 --> 20:24.707
Never let anybody
get into major.

20:25.910 --> 20:27.978
Not even your mother.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.347
I know dad I was there.

20:31.781 --> 20:33.050
But what happened today

20:34.085 --> 20:35.186
give me a lesson.

20:37.821 --> 20:38.621
I was never

20:39.890 --> 20:40.690
in control

20:42.826 --> 20:43.626
of my future.

20:46.363 --> 20:50.000
My utopia was an easy pretext.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.003
A loop, an excuse.

20:55.372 --> 20:56.639
You get this.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.178
You lost me dad why
don't we sit down.

21:01.212 --> 21:02.779
I lost you a long time ago.

21:04.448 --> 21:07.051
That's why I'm gonna do this.

21:10.855 --> 21:13.656
I hope you'll understand.

21:15.926 --> 21:19.196
You understand my my
decision, my sacrifice

21:21.465 --> 21:22.967
in the future.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.835
Dad lets just calm
down have a seat.

21:59.503 --> 22:00.703
Dad?

22:01.939 --> 22:02.739
Don't
leave it unattended.

22:03.773 --> 22:06.143
Try not crashing it.

22:06.177 --> 22:07.178
Go Go.

22:07.211 --> 22:08.811
Get out of here, go.

22:13.350 --> 22:15.252
Remember to keep to the right!

22:15.286 --> 22:16.120
Dad?

22:18.522 --> 22:19.356
Dad.

22:21.926 --> 22:24.094
Calm down, calm down.

22:24.128 --> 22:24.995
Take a breath.

22:26.497 --> 22:27.431
You just arrived.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.834
Come here.

22:31.869 --> 22:32.970
I need to talk to you.

22:34.438 --> 22:36.207
Easy, easy.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.247
See the thing is back.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.782
You feel better, yeah.

22:45.815 --> 22:47.717
So why did you
push me last night?

22:48.818 --> 22:50.321
I pushed you.

22:50.354 --> 22:55.092
Yes, you pushed me into the
magnetic field and then we

22:55.792 --> 22:57.194
actually I think I blacked out

22:57.228 --> 23:00.931
but feels like it was
a few minutes ago.

23:00.965 --> 23:02.399
It was few minutes ago.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.202
Dad, it was it was nighttime.

23:06.570 --> 23:08.272
Son, you

23:10.574 --> 23:13.377
there is not an easy
way to say this.

23:13.410 --> 23:15.812
Please don't freak out, okay?

23:17.314 --> 23:19.749
You traveled through time.

23:21.418 --> 23:22.253
Sorry,

23:24.888 --> 23:25.522
through time

23:27.591 --> 23:29.093
What year is it dad?

23:29.126 --> 23:31.262
Its weird, everything
looks like yesterday.

23:35.132 --> 23:37.268
This is not one of your pranks.

23:37.301 --> 23:38.936
It is no prank.

23:45.609 --> 23:49.346
No, I refuse to believe that
this sent me into my future.

23:49.380 --> 23:51.115
In fact you didn't.

23:52.182 --> 23:54.485
This is not your future.

23:54.518 --> 23:57.221
Actually this is your past.

24:01.625 --> 24:02.426
My past.

24:09.867 --> 24:10.934
No, bullshit.

24:22.946 --> 24:24.281
What are you doing with that?

24:26.650 --> 24:28.519
Stop it you can't.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.022
This is the lab mascot Cheecha.

24:32.056 --> 24:32.890
So cute.

24:34.458 --> 24:35.893
Dad, I'm not on my own.

24:36.627 --> 24:37.528
So sorry.

24:37.561 --> 24:38.929
I didn't mean to interrupt.

24:38.962 --> 24:40.331
Ciao Olivia.

24:41.298 --> 24:43.000
I was just kidding around

24:43.033 --> 24:44.368
Take care of my Vespa okay.

24:47.004 --> 24:47.905
Holy shit.

24:47.938 --> 24:50.040
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

24:53.911 --> 24:54.844
How, how's that possible?

24:54.878 --> 24:56.980
Do you remember receiving
that video call?

24:58.082 --> 24:59.149
Yes, yes.

25:00.351 --> 25:01.352
Good.

25:01.385 --> 25:02.252
That's good.

25:03.220 --> 25:07.991
In the end, you did go
see your girlfriend.

25:08.025 --> 25:10.060
Wow, five minutes ago.

25:10.094 --> 25:11.895
She's not my girlfriend.

25:13.697 --> 25:15.999
65 minutes ago.

25:17.968 --> 25:20.070
Please tell me there's
a hidden camera show

25:20.104 --> 25:21.171
I'm actually doubled.

25:25.075 --> 25:27.544
Don't be silly and don't worry,

25:27.578 --> 25:30.080
you won't be doubled for long

25:30.114 --> 25:33.484
Please, follow me here a minute.

25:33.517 --> 25:35.285
When we started the machine,

25:36.120 --> 25:38.889
it created a time loop.

25:43.093 --> 25:46.430
Then you took the Vespa
out a few minutes later,

25:46.463 --> 25:50.634
which is also approximately
the moment of your arrival.

25:53.303 --> 25:57.474
Did you did you see yourself
riding the Vespa away

25:57.508 --> 25:59.042
when you arrived?

26:00.477 --> 26:01.712
A time machine.

26:01.745 --> 26:05.682
Yeah, now, I don't know
what Dr. Rick is doing.

26:05.716 --> 26:10.187
But when he comes back seems
I'll push him into the field.

26:10.220 --> 26:14.525
And he will travel 65
minutes back in time,

26:14.558 --> 26:15.392
you see,

26:16.560 --> 26:19.363
and he will become
you, Ricky two.

26:19.396 --> 26:20.597
Oh, I'm Ricky two now.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.601
Only until Ricky one
travels back in time

26:24.635 --> 26:27.070
and closes the loop.

26:27.104 --> 26:30.307
Then we should turn
the machine off.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.976
And how do you suppose to
know he's gonna do that?

26:33.010 --> 26:34.244
He will.

26:34.278 --> 26:35.679
He's not even a he,

26:36.713 --> 26:39.316
he's you one hour ago.

26:39.349 --> 26:42.252
From your perspective,
this is your past.

26:42.286 --> 26:45.722
So whatever happens next to him,

26:45.756 --> 26:47.491
has already happened to you.

26:48.158 --> 26:50.027
How could you do this to me?

26:50.961 --> 26:54.097
Technically speaking,
I haven't done it yet.

26:54.131 --> 26:58.335
And honestly, I'm as
the clueless as you are,

26:58.368 --> 27:01.305
Not that, this all of this is?

27:01.338 --> 27:04.274
I joined your research,
against everyone's advice.

27:04.308 --> 27:06.577
All of my mentors, even mom's.

27:06.610 --> 27:08.712
I was the only one
who believed in you.

27:08.745 --> 27:10.113
I know that.

27:10.147 --> 27:12.115
Oh, you know that,
you know that,

27:12.149 --> 27:15.052
yet behind my back, you're
making a time machine

27:15.085 --> 27:16.453
and you're using
test as crap as what,

27:16.487 --> 27:19.189
a cover up for me
as a guinea pig.

27:19.223 --> 27:22.392
No, no, you are going
too far let me explain.

27:22.426 --> 27:24.761
I don't want your
explanation dad.

27:25.696 --> 27:28.131
I don't want anything from you.

27:28.165 --> 27:31.134
Come back, you can't interfere!

27:38.742 --> 27:40.711
You are not the guinea
pig, Cheecha is.

27:44.147 --> 27:46.483
And you brought the
message from the future.

27:54.825 --> 27:56.226
I don't know what it means.

27:56.260 --> 27:59.563
It's French I presume
it's a proverb it means,

28:01.298 --> 28:04.101
time is unfaithful,

28:04.134 --> 28:06.069
for those who abuse it.

28:06.837 --> 28:09.306
You think it's like a threat?

28:09.339 --> 28:10.173
A threat?

28:11.542 --> 28:14.745
No, I don't think so.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.280
I thought you wrote it.

28:18.315 --> 28:19.349
No, me?

28:19.383 --> 28:21.418
But the calligraphy
seems feminine.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.454
Must have been Dr. Dissue.

28:24.488 --> 28:25.322
Doctor Who?

28:27.457 --> 28:29.693
Your colleague from the
university, the French woman.

28:31.295 --> 28:33.363
Dad how many French people
do you know out here?

28:33.397 --> 28:34.565
None that I can think of.

28:35.532 --> 28:37.869
That's weird, she said
you knew each other.

28:37.902 --> 28:40.103
You got to consider
the trauma leg.

28:42.306 --> 28:45.609
Cheecha appeared immediately
after the machine started,

28:45.642 --> 28:47.444
even before you did.

28:49.379 --> 28:52.149
So it will also travel
before

28:52.182 --> 28:54.685
Because the machine
only has one speed.

28:54.718 --> 28:59.723
Whatever enters in there,
only jumps 65 minutes back,

29:00.858 --> 29:02.292
Well it can't have
been her then.

29:02.326 --> 29:03.560
She was driving me
here at the time.

29:03.594 --> 29:04.494
Well, actually not me.

29:04.528 --> 29:06.630
She was driving, Ricky one here.

29:06.663 --> 29:08.465
Shit you know what I mean,

29:08.498 --> 29:09.399
but I can't be a coincidence.

29:09.433 --> 29:11.335
This is in French though.

29:11.368 --> 29:13.637
What do you mean driving here?

29:13.670 --> 29:16.373
Why would you need a ride?

29:16.406 --> 29:18.342
You had the Vespa!

29:18.375 --> 29:20.377
Yeah, that reminds me actually.

29:21.612 --> 29:23.447
Something happened
with the Vespa.

29:24.381 --> 29:27.150
Actually, no, don't
worry, now I can fix it.

29:29.252 --> 29:32.356
No, whatever happened,
it doesn't matter.

29:32.389 --> 29:35.292
If you break the time loop,

29:35.325 --> 29:37.127
you'll create a paradox.

29:38.328 --> 29:41.632
And I don't know, there
are several scenarios.

29:43.634 --> 29:45.569
But they're just a speculation.

29:45.602 --> 29:47.638
Yes, dad its fine.

29:47.671 --> 29:50.407
I know, I'm a scientist
too, as well remember.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.176
Besides I've seen every
time travel movie ever made.

29:53.210 --> 29:54.745
I'm not going to stop
myself going back in time.

29:54.778 --> 29:56.546
I'm just gonna, you know,

29:56.580 --> 29:58.615
get the Vespa before
it gets stolen.

29:59.449 --> 30:00.283
Stolen?

30:06.356 --> 30:07.925
Don't talk to anyone!

31:50.360 --> 31:50.962
Damn it!

31:52.829 --> 31:53.630
Hey, hey!

31:58.002 --> 32:00.704
I'm literally looking
at myself in the moment.

32:00.737 --> 32:02.039
I mean to be fair it's
pretty interesting

32:05.877 --> 32:08.311
Dad you're talking
pre-destination fate.

32:08.345 --> 32:10.680
How can you of all people
believe in such things?

32:12.917 --> 32:13.750
Okay.

32:16.787 --> 32:18.789
What about things that
haven't happened yet?

32:21.458 --> 32:23.861
Well, we wish people
really gonna send the heat,

32:23.895 --> 32:24.694
don't you?

32:26.931 --> 32:28.765
But how much would I win

32:28.799 --> 32:31.102
if I guessed all
five numbers correct?

32:31.135 --> 32:32.036
All five numbers?

32:32.069 --> 32:33.770
It's 6 million times the bet.

32:33.804 --> 32:35.572
Six million...

32:35.605 --> 32:38.341
Yeah, but never
happen around here.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.444
Usually people the
just two numbers.

32:41.478 --> 32:42.546
Yeah, I mean, I suppose
the chances of getting five

32:42.579 --> 32:45.715
numbers out of ninety are
what, 44 million to one,

32:45.749 --> 32:47.852
It must be fate.

32:47.885 --> 32:50.654
Yeah, that and
probably causality.

32:51.889 --> 32:52.890
When I was a little boy,

32:52.924 --> 32:54.959
my father used to run this place

32:54.992 --> 32:56.928
I used to a farmer

32:58.829 --> 33:01.398
Old man was smoking a pipe.

33:03.968 --> 33:05.368
Sitting on a sheep, baa.

33:07.171 --> 33:09.941
The old man recomended
one number to bet.

33:09.974 --> 33:10.841
Just one,

33:10.875 --> 33:12.843
Yeah, just one single number.

33:12.877 --> 33:15.712
But then,

33:15.745 --> 33:19.649
His grandpa, smoking
a pipe and sheep,

33:19.683 --> 33:21.685
he had four numbers to bet.

33:21.718 --> 33:23.054
You're not going to tell me.

33:23.087 --> 33:24.754
What I mean, he won

33:24.788 --> 33:26.590
He threw a party here
invite all the folks,

33:26.623 --> 33:29.026
the priest, the
mayor, it was 1993.

33:30.928 --> 33:33.865
Oh my God, this
was the last time,

33:33.898 --> 33:37.734
that someone score more than
three numbers in this place.

33:38.735 --> 33:40.637
Over 25 years ago?

33:40.670 --> 33:41.504
Yeah.

33:42.974 --> 33:45.842
So don't believe in fate.

33:45.877 --> 33:49.679
You should talk your father
into making a time machine.

33:49.713 --> 33:52.149
Yeah, might not be a bad idea?

33:52.183 --> 33:53.617
Listen, thanks, Mario.

33:53.650 --> 33:55.452
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

33:55.485 --> 33:56.954
The draw is being released

33:56.988 --> 33:59.190
You don't want to
know if you won?

33:59.223 --> 34:01.758
I don't think I've won

34:01.791 --> 34:02.960
One,

34:02.994 --> 34:04.862
two, three,

34:04.896 --> 34:05.729
four,

34:07.932 --> 34:11.135
Hey, hey!

34:11.168 --> 34:15.739
Mario, Mario,
Mario, are you okay?

34:17.841 --> 34:20.077
Oh dad, what have you done?

34:41.697 --> 34:42.900
30 million.

34:46.070 --> 34:49.472
30?

34:49.505 --> 34:50.141
30!

34:53.610 --> 34:54.444
30.

34:56.612 --> 34:57.447
Woo, 30 million.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.092
Closed, come on.

35:33.184 --> 35:34.018
Ciao.

35:41.993 --> 35:45.229
Que?

37:49.386 --> 37:51.288
I lost you a long time ago

37:53.190 --> 37:55.825
that's why I'm gonna do this.

38:03.968 --> 38:06.203
I hope you will understand.

38:08.405 --> 38:13.277
You understand my
decision, my sacrifice

38:14.345 --> 38:15.212
in the future,

38:15.246 --> 38:19.316
Dad let's just calm
down and have a sit.

38:24.855 --> 38:26.056
I'm sorry,

38:26.090 --> 38:27.458
What are you doing here?

38:27.491 --> 38:28.292
Sorry.

38:28.325 --> 38:30.127
I had to see it
with my own eyes.

38:30.161 --> 38:32.396
Your invention is
out of control.

38:32.429 --> 38:33.830
You might not see it yet,

38:33.864 --> 38:36.699
but there will be consequences.

38:36.733 --> 38:38.068
Yeah I figured.

38:38.102 --> 38:39.303
Why don't you come inside,

38:39.336 --> 38:40.703
you've also got some
explaining to do.

38:40.737 --> 38:41.838
Dad I'm here.

38:41.872 --> 38:45.442
I mean, yours is quite a
singular time perspective.

38:47.244 --> 38:49.146
Isn't it like living
your past, present

38:49.180 --> 38:51.448
and future at the same time?

38:51.482 --> 38:52.715
What, my future?

38:54.485 --> 38:57.720
A forward thinker like you
hasn't considered the future?

39:02.259 --> 39:03.760
Dad she was spying.

39:03.793 --> 39:06.463
You're out of time and
you can't stay here.

39:06.497 --> 39:08.065
It's dangerous.

39:08.098 --> 39:10.800
Dangerous, what are
you talking about dad?

39:10.833 --> 39:11.734
Dad is that who I think?

39:11.768 --> 39:13.803
Yes, he's the man.

39:13.836 --> 39:14.905
I don't understand.

39:15.838 --> 39:17.341
He's with her.

39:17.374 --> 39:18.375
She set us up.

39:18.409 --> 39:19.809
No, no, I didn't.

39:19.842 --> 39:22.513
Are you doing all of
this for the money?

39:22.546 --> 39:24.048
What money?

39:24.081 --> 39:25.916
The money of course,

39:27.151 --> 39:29.353
Lock yourself inside.

39:29.386 --> 39:30.254
I'll handle it.

39:46.337 --> 39:48.339
Ricky, shut the doors.

39:52.109 --> 39:54.445
Why am I the only one who
seems to be left in the dark?

39:54.478 --> 39:55.613
That's quite the opposite.

39:55.646 --> 39:59.116
You are probably the only person
who knows the whole story.

40:03.420 --> 40:05.422
Just trust me with this.

40:05.456 --> 40:08.325
Turn the machine off before
the loops get concluded.

40:08.359 --> 40:10.793
No one should have a such
interaction with time.

40:12.429 --> 40:14.365
Is that what you meant
when you wrote this note?

40:14.398 --> 40:16.200
I know you're gonna
send it with the pig.

40:16.233 --> 40:17.334
The pig.

40:18.302 --> 40:19.136
Yeah.

40:22.506 --> 40:23.340
But you didn't?

40:24.208 --> 40:26.076
What are you talking about?

40:26.110 --> 40:27.478
We were here when we
received the message,

40:27.511 --> 40:30.581
which means, when I
found this in your car,

40:30.614 --> 40:32.983
I must have changed time.

40:33.017 --> 40:34.018
Of course you did.

40:36.186 --> 40:39.456
Wait a second, you
searched my bag?

40:39.490 --> 40:40.924
Yeah.

40:40.958 --> 40:42.359
And I found your
university notes.

40:42.393 --> 40:45.195
You knew about the time
machine before we did.

40:45.229 --> 40:48.932
So Excuse My French, why
don't we just cut the shit,

40:48.966 --> 40:50.901
and you can tell me
why we're really here.

40:50.934 --> 40:52.269
We want the same thing.

40:52.303 --> 40:53.971
I'm here to help

40:54.004 --> 40:56.940
I promise I would bet
you've got to co-operate.

40:56.974 --> 40:58.876
No no, no, I don't care.

40:58.909 --> 41:00.511
What kind of deal
you have my father

41:00.544 --> 41:02.479
or what he promised you.

41:02.513 --> 41:04.948
Okay, you have you're
trying to frame him

41:04.982 --> 41:07.885
I read the notes
delusional disorder, yeah.

41:07.918 --> 41:11.522
You're trying to discredit
him just like everyone else.

41:11.555 --> 41:12.990
That's how you picture it.

41:13.023 --> 41:16.527
Yeah, that is and who's
that outside anyway.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.827
Can be anyone,

41:20.397 --> 41:22.132
could even be you
from what I know.

41:30.307 --> 41:33.110
Dad, is everything all right?

41:37.948 --> 41:40.084
It's cool, you
brought the bike back.

41:40.117 --> 41:40.951
We forgive you.

41:45.055 --> 41:46.056
Who's there?

42:00.037 --> 42:04.942
Have you seen...

42:36.473 --> 42:37.307
Roco

43:10.307 --> 43:13.644
You need to stop doing that.

43:15.245 --> 43:16.079
Dad.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.115
Dad?

43:22.052 --> 43:23.253
Oh, no, Dad, Dad!

43:25.589 --> 43:27.191
I thought you said this is...

43:27.224 --> 43:28.659
Why did you do this?

43:28.692 --> 43:30.694
Why did you do, it, why?

43:32.496 --> 43:33.764
- Dad!
- Stay back.

43:33.797 --> 43:35.165
Dad, please.

43:37.201 --> 43:39.203
He can't hear you Ricky.

43:40.170 --> 43:41.205
He can't.

43:49.379 --> 43:51.548
No that is not gonna help!

43:53.183 --> 43:55.752
You can change things
if you don't go!

44:18.342 --> 44:20.244
Don't talk to anyone!

46:55.599 --> 46:57.167
So that's how you did it.

46:58.402 --> 47:00.504
You sent the numbers
back with Cheecha.

47:00.537 --> 47:03.507
You need to stop
being like that.

47:03.540 --> 47:04.608
You want to kill me.

47:04.641 --> 47:06.343
Quite the opposite actually.

47:07.979 --> 47:10.514
Is it gonna work?

47:12.649 --> 47:13.483
We become a rich.

47:15.652 --> 47:17.654
Well, yes,

47:17.688 --> 47:18.923
Yes.

47:18.956 --> 47:22.693
We made it, cheers!

47:24.896 --> 47:25.897
That's it.

47:27.531 --> 47:30.667
Everything is gonna
work out for the best.

47:32.602 --> 47:35.605
Just answer your damn
phone, Dad, it's me.

47:40.978 --> 47:42.646
Ricky?

47:42.679 --> 47:46.750
I'm literally looking
at myself at the moment

47:46.783 --> 47:47.617
What?

47:55.559 --> 47:56.861
Alright Cheecha.

48:09.941 --> 48:10.774
I knew it.

48:21.052 --> 48:22.285
What a stupid prank.

48:22.319 --> 48:24.421
Why didn't you just send a note?

48:24.454 --> 48:27.758
Get changed, you
stink like a Cheecha.

48:27.791 --> 48:29.693
You spoke to Mario then.

48:29.726 --> 48:31.595
Yeah, he passed out dad,

48:31.628 --> 48:34.631
I had to sneak out like a thief.

48:34.664 --> 48:37.467
I mean, what's he gonna
say when he wakes up?

48:37.501 --> 48:39.302
Did you ever consider that?

48:39.336 --> 48:40.938
I asked you not
to talk to anyone.

48:42.572 --> 48:44.508
Why did you travel back again?

48:44.541 --> 48:45.809
What happened to you?

48:45.842 --> 48:47.677
What happened to me,
what happened to you?

48:47.711 --> 48:48.845
What happened to me?

48:49.881 --> 48:53.017
What could possibly happen
to me in an hour or so?

48:53.050 --> 48:55.452
I mean, if I'm not
gonna die then...

48:57.621 --> 48:59.656
Mamamia I'm gonna die.

48:59.689 --> 49:01.625
No, no, no, dad,
just calm down.

49:01.658 --> 49:03.560
Okay, you're not gonna.

49:03.593 --> 49:04.795
Well you're not
supposed to die yet,

49:04.828 --> 49:06.730
I mean you've got,
you've got an hour.

49:19.810 --> 49:21.645
See there, you notice?

49:26.616 --> 49:29.519
See the way she's looking?

49:29.553 --> 49:31.822
She's staring like she already
knows I'm gonna be there.

49:31.856 --> 49:33.557
How would she
possibly know that?

49:35.893 --> 49:39.830
Pushing down the cliff,
by the hand of a stranger.

49:39.864 --> 49:40.932
French.

49:40.965 --> 49:43.533
She's no stranger dad she
works at the university

49:43.567 --> 49:44.768
she knows everything about you,

49:44.801 --> 49:46.837
she knows everything
about the time machine.

49:46.871 --> 49:47.972
Everything?

49:49.639 --> 49:51.876
She said this guy has some
sort of deal worked out.

49:53.044 --> 49:55.913
How many times,
I don't know her.

49:57.447 --> 50:01.551
What about the guy from
the grocery store then?

50:02.619 --> 50:03.820
Who?

50:03.855 --> 50:05.923
Walker, he's about
to get out here.

50:05.957 --> 50:08.926
He's gonna knock me out.

50:08.960 --> 50:10.527
You don't think Olivia as well?

50:11.461 --> 50:16.566
Come on a conspiracy
between some scientists,

50:17.101 --> 50:19.070
in that

50:20.770 --> 50:22.874
It's ridiculous.

50:22.907 --> 50:25.609
What do you suggest that
it's gonna happen in an hour

50:25.642 --> 50:27.011
if we lock her up.

50:27.044 --> 50:29.947
We are obviously
missing something here.

50:29.981 --> 50:34.986
Something that connects the
dots and explain everything.

50:36.686 --> 50:39.991
Okay, dad, I think its time
you told me the whole story,

50:40.024 --> 50:41.758
don't you?

50:41.791 --> 50:42.592
Okay,

50:44.095 --> 50:44.896
alright.

50:46.496 --> 50:50.968
Well, first of all, there
is not a university.

50:52.937 --> 50:55.039
I'm not working for them.

50:55.072 --> 50:56.040
How could I?

50:57.474 --> 51:00.878
I mean, they think I'm crazy.

51:00.912 --> 51:01.913
Sorry, what?

51:03.948 --> 51:05.082
I made it up.

51:09.921 --> 51:12.089
Well, who's paying
for all of this?

51:12.123 --> 51:13.891
The the equipment,
the lab everything.

51:13.925 --> 51:18.062
All from my savings
in and a few loans.

51:20.998 --> 51:22.900
What was I supposed to do?

51:24.035 --> 51:28.772
I was so close to
complete the research.

51:28.805 --> 51:31.675
And you were involved.

51:32.977 --> 51:34.844
I couldn't turn it down.

51:38.115 --> 51:40.017
After I lost you
and your mother,

51:41.152 --> 51:44.088
my research was all I got left,

51:44.121 --> 51:46.157
I think you will find
it was your research

51:46.190 --> 51:48.525
that lost us in the
first place dad.

51:50.027 --> 51:50.827
You're right.

51:52.863 --> 51:54.131
I'm right.

51:54.165 --> 51:55.166
Yeah.

51:56.100 --> 51:59.870
I was in a sort of loop,

51:59.904 --> 52:03.207
similar to what
you were in today.

52:07.711 --> 52:09.612
I was stuck in the past.

52:10.714 --> 52:13.250
I was using it as...

52:15.552 --> 52:16.854
As an excuse.

52:19.656 --> 52:20.690
Yeah, as an excuse.

52:22.093 --> 52:26.130
Well, until one day you
agreed to join the project.

52:28.199 --> 52:29.833
It was a breakthrough.

52:31.202 --> 52:35.805
You know, you
following my steps.

52:35.839 --> 52:37.274
I wouldn't put it that way dad.

52:38.641 --> 52:40.744
I'm just saying
it seemed perfect.

52:42.213 --> 52:46.583
My project was gonna lead
you to a brilliant career

52:47.784 --> 52:50.221
and maybe fix the
things between us.

52:51.654 --> 52:55.558
If the tests or didn't
the truth is,

52:57.128 --> 53:00.898
I didn't know we were
making a time machine,

53:00.931 --> 53:02.699
until one hour ago.

53:04.135 --> 53:06.703
Sorry, are you saying that,

53:08.605 --> 53:10.875
that is an accident.

53:10.908 --> 53:14.311
Clearly, there is
no field of force,

53:14.345 --> 53:17.314
that accounts for the
motion of the batteries.

53:18.748 --> 53:20.117
Tesla was wrong.

53:21.118 --> 53:23.586
Would you make any of it public?

53:24.855 --> 53:26.290
I mean, two hours after
we switch this thing on,

53:26.323 --> 53:27.158
it kills you.

53:27.191 --> 53:28.292
It's too dangerous.

53:30.161 --> 53:31.661
What if this fell
into the wrong hands?

53:31.694 --> 53:32.329
You can't make this public.

53:32.363 --> 53:33.931
Exactly.

53:33.964 --> 53:36.333
But no publication means also...

53:36.367 --> 53:37.801
Means no career for me.

53:41.038 --> 53:42.907
I go back to London
empty handed.

53:44.141 --> 53:45.309
Not empty handed.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.314
Oh, I see.

53:50.347 --> 53:52.283
So you'll be planned to
make some money out of this

53:52.316 --> 53:54.118
before you switched
it off, did you?

53:55.019 --> 53:57.321
I had no time for plans?

53:57.354 --> 53:59.622
You were there too
when Cheecha appeared.

54:01.691 --> 54:04.828
I only read the numbers
and played along.

54:06.263 --> 54:09.266
Sorry, so you're gonna send
these numbers back in time

54:09.300 --> 54:12.269
just because you received
them from the future?

54:12.303 --> 54:14.105
That doesn't make any
sense dad in fact,

54:14.138 --> 54:15.272
that's the paradox.

54:17.141 --> 54:18.641
Nothing is ever written.

54:18.675 --> 54:20.377
It has to start somewhere or,

54:20.411 --> 54:23.047
or some when in
his case, enough,

54:23.080 --> 54:25.382
Whose idea was it to play
the lotto in the first place?

54:25.416 --> 54:28.285
You shouldn't ask
yourself who has decided

54:29.353 --> 54:33.057
but whose intention was it?

54:34.425 --> 54:35.993
Intention?

54:36.026 --> 54:37.128
Did you playing?

54:37.161 --> 54:41.866
Or did you just think about
winning the lotto somehow?

54:45.369 --> 54:46.937
I spoke to Mario about it,

54:46.971 --> 54:50.107
but we we'd already won.

54:50.141 --> 54:52.943
We'd always we always
had we'd already won.

54:55.045 --> 54:56.313
I don't know what do you think?

54:56.347 --> 54:58.781
Don't wrap your head around it.

54:58.815 --> 55:00.717
This is beyond us.

55:00.750 --> 55:03.220
There is so much we
don't know about time.

55:04.754 --> 55:07.757
Now, let's send Cheecha back

55:09.160 --> 55:11.028
Dad, you really need to
forget about this money.

55:11.061 --> 55:12.963
Okay, we need to switch this
off before it kills you.

55:12.997 --> 55:17.201
Ricky, you surprise
me, we can't.

55:20.271 --> 55:23.374
You are here only because
we are not going to.

55:28.078 --> 55:29.746
At what time do I die?

55:29.779 --> 55:31.714
Seventeen past seven.

55:38.022 --> 55:40.224
If we turn it off now,

55:40.257 --> 55:42.293
instead of sending Cheecha back,

55:42.326 --> 55:44.995
there would be no Ricky
one going back in time,

55:45.029 --> 55:46.463
no Ricky two.

55:46.497 --> 55:47.498
And no Ricky three.

55:47.531 --> 55:49.133
You would probably disappear

55:49.166 --> 55:51.001
or who knows?

55:51.035 --> 55:53.736
I'd rather disappear
and watch you die again.

55:53.770 --> 55:55.139
Well, I appreciate your bravery

55:55.172 --> 55:57.875
but you wouldn't
be here to warn me,

55:58.876 --> 56:02.745
this this conversation
would never take place

56:02.779 --> 56:06.483
and we still
wouldn't turn it off.

56:08.852 --> 56:10.854
The machine is meant to stay on.

56:11.622 --> 56:13.457
So what dad 'cause
I don't understand.

56:13.490 --> 56:15.259
Do we just sit here and then

56:15.292 --> 56:16.126
we wait for you to be killed?

56:16.160 --> 56:18.529
Is that a plan?

56:18.562 --> 56:23.334
I just want to make sure
I secure you a future.

56:26.337 --> 56:29.839
In case I don't make it

56:29.873 --> 56:30.874
after tonight.

56:32.009 --> 56:34.878
A future where are
you out reign me.

56:34.912 --> 56:39.917
With a ridiculous load of
money instead of

56:43.320 --> 56:44.521
I'll leave it up to you.

56:53.397 --> 56:54.797
Dad is that a pig?

56:54.831 --> 56:56.066
Grab the pig!

56:58.402 --> 57:01.838
If you don't mind, I'd like
to double check everything.

57:01.872 --> 57:04.375
I feel I will get
some lucky number.

57:19.290 --> 57:20.391
30 million.

57:23.327 --> 57:24.228
30 million.

57:28.932 --> 57:31.168
So that's how you did it.

57:37.541 --> 57:39.910
I'll leave it up to you.

58:08.505 --> 58:10.341
You're wrong about time dad,

58:10.374 --> 58:12.443
you can change the past.

58:12.476 --> 58:13.510
Just look at this message.

58:13.544 --> 58:15.879
I was meant to send it
back with Cheecha numbers,

58:15.913 --> 58:16.947
but I never did.

58:16.980 --> 58:18.949
And now you can't remember.

58:18.982 --> 58:20.050
We just changed time.

58:20.084 --> 58:21.085
Oh really?

58:22.319 --> 58:24.088
What do you remember?

58:28.025 --> 58:31.061
I don't know maybe 'cause
this time it was bullshit?

58:31.095 --> 58:32.596
With my timeline
and your timeline,

58:32.629 --> 58:34.898
are two completely
different things.

58:34.932 --> 58:37.201
I know where you are heading.

58:37.234 --> 58:41.004
Please, don't even mention
parallel universes.

58:41.038 --> 58:43.273
It only makes things
even more complicated

58:43.307 --> 58:45.109
than they currently are.

58:45.142 --> 58:47.411
If there's a chance
that we have to try it,

58:48.445 --> 58:49.680
But...

58:49.713 --> 58:51.382
No dad just listened
to me for once.

58:51.415 --> 58:54.184
Okay, so I can go back in
time I can appear in the lab

58:54.218 --> 58:56.320
after Cheecha right
where it all began.

58:56.353 --> 58:57.354
No, Ricky.

58:57.388 --> 58:58.989
It doesn't matter.

58:59.022 --> 59:00.290
But I know where the
French woman is gonna be;

59:00.324 --> 59:02.593
I can follow her,
I can talk to her,

59:02.626 --> 59:04.027
I can probably stop her.

59:04.061 --> 59:05.262
I mean, I really
don't see what we

59:05.295 --> 59:06.497
have to lose with this dad,

59:06.530 --> 59:09.166
Ricky, if you calm
down a second.

59:09.199 --> 59:12.002
There is one more thing that
I should talk to you about.

59:13.337 --> 59:14.138
Is that you?

59:14.171 --> 59:15.506
Yeah.

59:15.539 --> 59:17.007
He can't see me.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.242
I know.

59:18.275 --> 59:22.146
You gotta go, don't take
anything for granted.

59:34.091 --> 59:35.592
Dad.

59:43.567 --> 59:45.636
Good job.

59:45.669 --> 59:48.205
Would you take it back to
the a minute,

59:48.238 --> 59:51.442
please, that's the last
thing we need around.

59:51.475 --> 59:53.177
No problem boss.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.655
How did you do that?

01:00:12.196 --> 01:00:13.597
This isn't your pig is it dad?

01:00:28.078 --> 01:00:30.714
You made it, what have you done?

01:00:34.384 --> 01:00:36.220
You look sick.

01:00:36.253 --> 01:00:37.721
I'll be fine in a minute.

01:00:37.754 --> 01:00:39.156
This is my third time travel.

01:00:39.189 --> 01:00:40.691
Time travel?

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.693
Yeah, we really screwed up.

01:00:48.332 --> 01:00:50.234
Dad, I'm sorry,

01:00:50.267 --> 01:00:51.201
we don't have time.

01:00:52.402 --> 01:00:53.470
Do not tell him about me.

01:00:53.504 --> 01:00:55.205
He's not ready.

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:56.740
He wont understand,

01:00:56.773 --> 01:00:58.375
he'll probably try and do
something stupid, okay?

01:00:58.408 --> 01:01:00.777
You discovered time travel.

01:01:00.811 --> 01:01:02.613
Don't get excited
it's a bad thing.

01:01:04.214 --> 01:01:06.116
This is a reminder,
to not abuse time,

01:01:06.149 --> 01:01:08.051
whatever you think you
might be able to do.

01:01:08.085 --> 01:01:09.286
It won't work.

01:01:10.387 --> 01:01:12.122
Is this French?

01:01:12.155 --> 01:01:16.560
Oh, don't go play the lotto.

01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:20.497
Lotto?

01:01:20.531 --> 01:01:21.365
Lotto?

01:01:28.605 --> 01:01:29.573
That scare you too?

01:01:44.154 --> 01:01:44.821
Hey boy.

01:01:44.856 --> 01:01:45.890
Ciao.

01:01:45.924 --> 01:01:48.258
Should be more careful
where you tie that horse,

01:01:48.292 --> 01:01:49.293
it could be dangerous.

01:01:57.467 --> 01:01:58.268
Ciao boy.

01:02:41.345 --> 01:02:42.245
Get off me.

01:02:42.279 --> 01:02:43.714
I hit you with my car I'm sorry.

01:02:43.747 --> 01:02:45.816
I mean a bike cut me off.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.919
You killed him.

01:02:47.952 --> 01:02:49.519
You killed my dad.

01:02:49.553 --> 01:02:50.220
Sir you hit your head,

01:02:50.253 --> 01:02:51.688
you need some time to recover.

01:02:51.722 --> 01:02:52.556
I'm fine.

01:02:53.757 --> 01:02:56.460
Sir your mind must
be playing tricks.

01:02:59.196 --> 01:03:00.364
Trust me, I'm a psychologist.

01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:01.732
My name is Celestin.

01:03:01.765 --> 01:03:02.867
I know who you are,

01:03:04.301 --> 01:03:05.602
you're just after
the time machine.

01:03:05.636 --> 01:03:06.904
Time machine?

01:03:06.938 --> 01:03:08.605
Yeah you work at
a university now?

01:03:08.639 --> 01:03:09.806
How do you know that?

01:03:12.209 --> 01:03:13.343
Wait a second.

01:03:13.377 --> 01:03:16.847
Are you by any chance related
to a certain Doctor Vinner?

01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:18.382
Come on I'm his son.

01:03:18.415 --> 01:03:19.416
What a coincidence,

01:03:19.449 --> 01:03:23.320
I'm here for an evaluation
to assess his sanity

01:03:23.353 --> 01:03:24.388
with the best intention.

01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:26.657
You know they are willing
to support his project

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:28.759
if he comes to a reason.

01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:31.762
Time machine,

01:03:32.897 --> 01:03:35.632
this is turning a little
different than I was expecting.

01:03:37.834 --> 01:03:39.436
I don't understand this.

01:03:39.469 --> 01:03:41.371
You came to the lab.

01:03:41.405 --> 01:03:42.806
You saw everything.

01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:45.308
May I suggest we
go to the hospital?

01:03:45.342 --> 01:03:48.645
It's not uncommon after a
shock to confuse suggestions

01:03:48.679 --> 01:03:50.847
and reality, please.

01:03:50.882 --> 01:03:51.715
No.

01:03:54.986 --> 01:03:58.522
Sir, please take
a seat in the car.

01:04:02.826 --> 01:04:05.963
Is there any place where I can
get you something to drink?

01:04:21.578 --> 01:04:23.413
This is happening
in about an hour,

01:04:23.447 --> 01:04:24.748
whether you like it or not.

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:27.317
Yeah, I mean, I thought
I could change something.

01:04:28.285 --> 01:04:29.720
I'm not sure.

01:04:29.753 --> 01:04:31.521
My father seems to think that
you can't change anything

01:04:31.555 --> 01:04:32.556
that's already happened.

01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:33.590
Can't argue with that.

01:04:34.558 --> 01:04:37.394
Although you said it is
yet to happen, right?

01:04:37.427 --> 01:04:40.564
Like if we'd go checking
we'd find him alive.

01:04:40.597 --> 01:04:42.733
I mean, it's
happening to me now.

01:04:42.766 --> 01:04:44.367
Not me, that the third me,

01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:47.571
the one who traveled through
time, the second time.

01:04:47.604 --> 01:04:50.407
Clear has the so
he's going to die?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.309
Is that what you're saying?

01:04:52.342 --> 01:04:52.977
Yeah.

01:04:54.344 --> 01:04:55.846
And to top it all
off, it's my fault.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.949
It's my intention
to bag the lotto.

01:04:57.982 --> 01:04:59.549
Intentions?

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:01.284
Yeah, so we figure down the lab,

01:05:02.753 --> 01:05:04.454
intentions is
essentially what...

01:05:04.488 --> 01:05:08.960
I'm sorry but no one's future
is driven by intentions.

01:05:08.993 --> 01:05:10.895
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

01:05:10.928 --> 01:05:13.931
The world is full of good
intentions and still.

01:05:16.633 --> 01:05:19.469
Besides, doesn't it
seem strange to you

01:05:19.503 --> 01:05:23.573
that all your fears and
insecurities came to life out of the

01:05:23.607 --> 01:05:25.943
blue in a couple
of hours window.

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:29.579
What do you mean?

01:05:29.613 --> 01:05:31.548
Well, your father betrays
you, your girlfriend.

01:05:31.581 --> 01:05:32.682
Not my girlfriend.

01:05:32.716 --> 01:05:36.553
The girl you like, he sees
the guy you actually saw.

01:05:36.586 --> 01:05:41.558
Who also takes part involving
the theft of your motorbike,

01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:42.659
in order to let me,

01:05:42.692 --> 01:05:45.829
a foreign doctor who has
never been to this village

01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:49.399
lure you with the purpose
to get to your lab,

01:05:49.432 --> 01:05:51.701
which I already
know the address.

01:05:51.735 --> 01:05:53.537
This is obviously a fantasy.

01:05:54.471 --> 01:05:56.807
You should have come
to your senses guy now.

01:05:57.841 --> 01:06:00.811
I'm very concerned about
your head trauma unless...

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.849
Ricky, have you
ever been diagnosed?

01:06:06.616 --> 01:06:09.854
Okay, look, can we just
pretend for a moment,

01:06:09.887 --> 01:06:11.488
that what I'm
telling you is true

01:06:11.521 --> 01:06:13.858
and that time machines exist.

01:06:13.891 --> 01:06:15.860
I'm not willing to indulge
in those illusions.

01:06:15.893 --> 01:06:17.494
Perhaps just this once.

01:06:20.965 --> 01:06:23.100
What other than my intentions
could possibly lead me

01:06:23.134 --> 01:06:24.835
to some happy ending other than

01:06:24.869 --> 01:06:29.006
the materialization of all of
my worst nightmares at once.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.875
And partly your expectations.

01:06:30.908 --> 01:06:33.410
I wasn't expecting this.

01:06:33.443 --> 01:06:34.477
Any of it?

01:06:34.511 --> 01:06:35.412
Of course you're not.

01:06:35.445 --> 01:06:36.981
At least not consciously.

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:41.919
Have you ever heard about
self fulfilling prophecies?

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.622
Look, a self
fulfilling prophecy,

01:06:45.655 --> 01:06:47.824
is when a person
unknowingly causes

01:06:47.859 --> 01:06:49.793
a prediction to come true,

01:06:49.826 --> 01:06:53.931
due to the simple fact that
he expects it to come true.

01:06:53.965 --> 01:06:57.567
Like you expect your
new roommate to be shy,

01:06:57.601 --> 01:06:59.569
so you don't speak much to him,

01:06:59.603 --> 01:07:01.705
and therefore he does seem shy.

01:07:02.372 --> 01:07:04.608
Okay, doctor I really don't see

01:07:04.641 --> 01:07:05.977
what this has to do with me.

01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:09.412
Ricky, have you
ever truly believe

01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:12.116
that your father's
project could succeed?

01:07:12.149 --> 01:07:13.885
Or that girl would
like you back?

01:07:15.987 --> 01:07:19.023
Of course those
pessimistic expectations

01:07:19.056 --> 01:07:21.825
condition the nightmare you
had when you passed out.

01:07:22.692 --> 01:07:23.928
This wasn't a dream,

01:07:23.961 --> 01:07:25.930
and I really don't
see how expectations

01:07:25.963 --> 01:07:27.899
could have changed anything
that's already happened.

01:07:27.932 --> 01:07:30.101
Ricky, I can help you
to go through this.

01:07:30.134 --> 01:07:32.069
If you just allow me.

01:07:33.737 --> 01:07:37.540
Okay, okay, you see that guy
over there with a guitar.

01:07:37.574 --> 01:07:39.977
In a moment, he's going to
start playing something,

01:07:40.011 --> 01:07:41.112
and when he does,

01:07:41.145 --> 01:07:43.847
I'm going to pull up over
there on my bike by the tree,

01:07:43.881 --> 01:07:46.017
okay, and then
another version of me,

01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:47.784
is gonna run out from
behind that wall.

01:07:47.817 --> 01:07:50.487
He's gonna run straight
back because he sees you.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.690
Now, if, if what I'm
saying isn't true,

01:07:53.723 --> 01:07:56.127
if I'm wrong, then fine I
will follow you to hospital.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:56.994
I like that.

01:07:58.195 --> 01:08:00.197
If what I'm telling
you is right,

01:08:00.231 --> 01:08:01.564
if all this happens,

01:08:01.598 --> 01:08:04.101
then you have to
promise that you will

01:08:04.135 --> 01:08:08.239
you help us stay out of the
way of any version of me.

01:08:08.272 --> 01:08:10.107
Do not talk to them and also,

01:08:10.141 --> 01:08:11.841
please do not go
near the latter.

01:08:11.876 --> 01:08:12.977
Where are you going?

01:08:14.577 --> 01:08:16.113
I have to go and
deal with a man.

01:08:16.147 --> 01:08:18.115
Do we have a deal or not.

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:19.549
I promise, I'll help you.

01:10:21.638 --> 01:10:22.339
Hey, hey!

01:10:26.643 --> 01:10:28.711
I'm literally looking
at myself unless.

01:10:29.914 --> 01:10:32.149
You alright

01:10:32.183 --> 01:10:33.683
Yeah, sorry,

01:10:33.716 --> 01:10:35.319
have we met before,
you know my dad?

01:11:06.183 --> 01:11:08.685
Ricky, you made it, come in.

01:11:13.023 --> 01:11:14.191
Where's he going?

01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:16.726
Who, my brother?

01:11:16.759 --> 01:11:17.995
Your brother?

01:11:18.028 --> 01:11:19.330
Just a few things
left to sort out.

01:11:19.363 --> 01:11:21.298
And then we can go
for that gelato.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.701
Is this his hat?

01:11:26.337 --> 01:11:27.171
You like it?

01:11:30.407 --> 01:11:31.741
You look cute.

01:11:35.745 --> 01:11:36.380
Olivia.

01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:39.950
You all right?

01:11:39.984 --> 01:11:41.452
Yeah.

01:11:41.485 --> 01:11:45.389
Do you ever think You
know something like you

01:11:45.422 --> 01:11:47.958
You really believe is true

01:11:47.992 --> 01:11:50.693
and then you see it from
someone else's point of view

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:54.198
and it changes everything.

01:11:54.231 --> 01:11:58.402
Ricky, if there is something
you are trying to say.

01:12:06.776 --> 01:12:07.978
Wow.

01:12:08.012 --> 01:12:10.780
Sorry if it came at a bad time.

01:12:14.385 --> 01:12:17.687
Que?

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:21.425
Que? Que?

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.841
I guess I just have to
change my perspective.

01:12:58.162 --> 01:13:01.465
We are out of time you can
stay here, it's dangerous.

01:13:02.832 --> 01:13:04.535
Dad is that who I think it is?

01:13:04.568 --> 01:13:05.802
It's the Vespa.

01:13:06.803 --> 01:13:08.439
I don't understand.

01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:11.041
He's with her, she set us up.

01:13:11.075 --> 01:13:12.476
No I'm not sure how he did it.

01:13:12.509 --> 01:13:15.479
Are you doing all
this for the money?

01:13:15.512 --> 01:13:17.281
What? Money?

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:21.118
Lock yourself inside.

01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:22.386
I'll handle it.

01:13:31.895 --> 01:13:33.897
What are you doing here?

01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:37.468
Don't tell me, always you.

01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:38.469
I figured it out,

01:13:40.604 --> 01:13:42.072
you have to die.

01:13:43.073 --> 01:13:45.109
Ricky, shut the damn door.

01:13:56.887 --> 01:13:59.189
Are you sure its gonna work?

01:14:04.094 --> 01:14:06.130
What if we make a mistake.

01:14:06.163 --> 01:14:07.931
There are countless variables.

01:14:10.968 --> 01:14:12.369
This has already happened.

01:14:13.437 --> 01:14:17.007
He's gonna see us, just snap

01:14:24.014 --> 01:14:27.551
Have you seen...

01:14:31.188 --> 01:14:32.056
I'm sorry.

01:14:45.135 --> 01:14:45.969
Roco.

01:14:53.644 --> 01:14:56.246
It's all right, he
knows what he's doing

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.614
What's going on here?

01:14:57.648 --> 01:14:59.183
How many copies are there?

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:04.555
We we haven't been
introduced properly.

01:15:05.356 --> 01:15:07.091
Thanks for your help.

01:15:08.025 --> 01:15:09.059
My help?

01:15:10.661 --> 01:15:12.129
Didn't think you were coming.

01:15:12.162 --> 01:15:14.098
Well, I promised
I was gonna help.

01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:19.002
Your place to be quite
important actually.

01:15:19.036 --> 01:15:20.070
My place?

01:15:20.738 --> 01:15:21.939
Oh, you haven't
explained anything yet?

01:15:21.972 --> 01:15:23.006
No.

01:15:24.274 --> 01:15:27.044
Go grab this thing,
follow me I'll explain.

01:15:39.156 --> 01:15:40.157
I am not doing it.

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:44.161
You have to, we need to to
move forward, Dad, just...

01:15:45.095 --> 01:15:46.196
Dr. Celestine, please

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.035
remember to scream, good luck.

01:16:07.418 --> 01:16:08.252
Dad, Dad!

01:16:09.987 --> 01:16:11.955
It's you, you set
this in motion!

01:16:11.989 --> 01:16:15.726
- Dad!
- Why did you do this, why?

01:16:15.759 --> 01:16:19.329
Okay, last time I save your life

01:16:19.363 --> 01:16:21.999
How can you not see that?

01:16:22.032 --> 01:16:23.333
It's quite dark.

01:16:24.201 --> 01:16:25.502
You do look a bit similar.

01:16:28.205 --> 01:16:29.673
- She's good.
- Yeah.

01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:37.181
No, that is not gonna help!

01:16:37.214 --> 01:16:41.118
You can change things
if you don't go!

01:16:44.221 --> 01:16:47.191
Can someone please
explain what's going on?

01:16:47.224 --> 01:16:50.027
Is this insanity
ever going to stop?

01:16:51.094 --> 01:16:52.996
Just come in, doctor, it's over.

01:17:13.784 --> 01:17:17.020
Actions, reactions,
consequences,

01:17:18.155 --> 01:17:19.456
all mixed up.

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:24.728
We still can't account
for the paradox though.

01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:31.068
Ricky has his own theory
about it, but I don't know.

01:17:31.735 --> 01:17:35.305
I presume we just demonstrated

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.276
the existence of a fate.

01:17:41.078 --> 01:17:42.713
Fate was a nice idea,

01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:45.816
but it has nothing
to do with physics.

01:17:45.849 --> 01:17:49.353
It is determined by your
actions, by who you are.

01:17:49.386 --> 01:17:53.257
And you don't need a time
machine to determine yours.

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.558
I'm afraid these
are all consequences

01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:56.493
of my actions actually.

01:17:56.527 --> 01:17:59.563
I mean, I came up
with a formula,

01:17:59.596 --> 01:18:00.797
I turn the machine on,

01:18:00.831 --> 01:18:03.500
I convince you to
play the lotto.

01:18:03.534 --> 01:18:07.271
I drag you into this,
stole the Vespa for myself,

01:18:07.304 --> 01:18:08.605
I kissed Olivia.

01:18:08.639 --> 01:18:09.473
You what?

01:18:11.475 --> 01:18:15.312
My whole life I thought I
was just reacting to things.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.249
And never I realized I
actually made things happen.

01:18:20.717 --> 01:18:23.520
I was wrong, you two were
right, I should have stopped.

01:18:24.488 --> 01:18:26.056
Larking around in the past,

01:18:27.324 --> 01:18:29.426
should have concentrate
on my future.

01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:31.361
But in the end, you
achieve something

01:18:31.395 --> 01:18:33.263
even harder than that.

01:18:33.297 --> 01:18:35.198
You change your mind about it

01:18:35.232 --> 01:18:38.635
and focus on your future
rather than your past.

01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:41.672
I'm sorry.

01:18:41.705 --> 01:18:43.240
I'm proud with you, son.

01:18:45.542 --> 01:18:48.545
You have nothing
to apologize for.

01:18:48.579 --> 01:18:51.648
The machine is such a big deal.

01:18:51.682 --> 01:18:55.085
I wouldn't trust
anybody else to use it.

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:59.556
Imagine how things
could have turned out,

01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:01.191
if you weren't here.

01:19:02.225 --> 01:19:05.362
I guess one crazy scientist
is enough for this family, eh?

01:19:08.231 --> 01:19:11.568
I'm sorry to interrupt
the family moment but.

01:19:11.602 --> 01:19:14.204
We need to turn it off!

01:19:14.237 --> 01:19:17.107
I'm glad to see you two
finally agree on something.

01:19:19.944 --> 01:19:20.777
You got it?

01:19:22.179 --> 01:19:23.180
Yeah, can you check
the display for us?

01:19:23.213 --> 01:19:25.449
Okay, what am I looking at?

01:19:25.482 --> 01:19:27.852
Just wait for the
bar to hit stable.

01:19:27.885 --> 01:19:31.822
Okay, device progressing.

01:19:35.692 --> 01:19:40.430
Now!

01:19:40.464 --> 01:19:41.498
Dad?

01:19:42.299 --> 01:19:45.836
Professor Reid,
where is the switch?

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:47.404
Everybody stay still.

01:19:47.437 --> 01:19:48.672
We forgot Mario.

01:19:48.705 --> 01:19:50.807
It's here, give me a second.

01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:51.675
Wait.

01:19:52.576 --> 01:19:54.578
Who is that talking?

01:20:05.555 --> 01:20:06.556
Oh, f...
