talkative this morning.

And I don't like to use
the word "whack" a lot...

00:13.733 --> 00:17.333
but the fact that I don't have
an office is truly whack.

whack.

into a whack-off with you, Gene.

way worse, babe!

I need you to have some
russ-prect!

20:46.000 --> 20:47.067
Okay, well, you just said...

20:47.067 --> 20:48.500
"russ-prect".
For the dead!

20:48.500 --> 20:49.533
I think we should leave.
For the dead!

20:49.533 --> 20:51.067
Okay.
I'm sorry.

20:51.067 --> 20:52.467
I have a thing with funerals.
Okay, I'm getting her out.

20:52.467 --> 20:54.533
It just always happens.
Problem is leaving.

20:54.533 --> 20:56.167
I'm normal. I can be normal!

20:56.167 --> 20:57.700
No one says, "I'm normal,"
who's normal.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.733
Someone get my Yamaha.

20:59.733 --> 21:05.733
♪ I saw Ned get hit
by a train ♪

21:05.733 --> 21:07.633
[BILLIE] Take a... train!
[GENE] Train!

21:12.933 --> 21:14.533
You're under a lot of stress.
It's a little noisy in here...

21:14.533 --> 21:15.867
Let me have Timothy see
about it.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.100
...so I'm just gonna go.
I am just booked up...

21:17.100 --> 21:18.133
to the gills with--
He doesn't have to.

21:18.133 --> 21:19.667
Timothy! Timothy!
Hold on, Mom.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.167
Make sure she gets out of the--
PTSD, and what-not, thank you.

21:22.167 --> 21:24.167
Underneath the cord, just duck
underneath.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.800
All right, have a good--
Yeah, I j-- I have to open the..

21:25.800 --> 21:27.133
door, 'cause it's very tricky.
Have a great day!

21:27.133 --> 21:27.633
Okay, thank you.
