01:15.308 --> 01:17.151
<i>When I was young</i>

01:17.210 --> 01:19.019
<i>I played for fun</i>

01:19.079 --> 01:20.990
<i>Made up the words</i>

01:21.047 --> 01:22.754
<i>Nobody heard</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:24.386
<i>But now I see</i>

01:24.784 --> 01:26.457
<i>All eyes on me</i>

01:26.653 --> 01:28.496
<i>And suddenly</i>

01:28.555 --> 01:30.364
<i>I'm in a dream</i>

01:31.257 --> 01:33.965
<i>I got a feeling now</i>

01:35.095 --> 01:38.668
<i>Everything's right somehow</i>

01:39.833 --> 01:41.471
<i>Here I am</i>

01:41.568 --> 01:43.172
<i>Being who I want</i>

01:43.403 --> 01:45.041
<i>Giving what I got</i>

01:45.338 --> 01:47.079
<i>Never a doubt now</i>

01:47.407 --> 01:48.852
<i>Here I go</i>

01:49.075 --> 01:50.645
<i>Burnin' like a spark</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:54.414
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

01:58.751 --> 02:00.822
Isn't she great,
Vanessa?

02:01.221 --> 02:03.394
Victoria! What are
you doing out here?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.697
Aunt Amelia!

02:05.758 --> 02:09.399
Oh, please, can't I go down to the
concert, just for a little bit?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.404
Absolutely not!

02:11.464 --> 02:13.535
We have guests.
Now come.

02:15.535 --> 02:18.243
And please do something
with your hair!

02:20.340 --> 02:22.752
Royal reception
number nine.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.647
<i>I wake up in the morning</i>

02:25.712 --> 02:27.783
<i>Like the duchess says</i>

02:27.847 --> 02:30.828
<i>When you're gonna
live your life right</i>

02:30.917 --> 02:32.624
<i>I know she thinks</i>

02:32.685 --> 02:34.358
<i>That I'm the fortunate one</i>

02:34.420 --> 02:37.458
<i>But princesses
wanna have fun</i>

02:37.524 --> 02:40.403
<i>Oh princesses wanna have</i>

02:40.593 --> 02:44.268
<i>That's all we really want</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:47.539
<i>Is some fun</i>

02:47.734 --> 02:51.409
<i>When the royal day is done</i>

02:51.471 --> 02:53.610
<i>Oh princesses wanna have fun</i>

02:53.940 --> 02:55.442
<i>I'm steppin' up</i>

02:55.742 --> 02:57.346
<i>Right to the top</i>

02:57.610 --> 02:59.146
<i>That's how I'm wired</i>

02:59.279 --> 03:00.986
<i>I take it higher</i>

03:01.381 --> 03:02.917
<i>I'm in control</i>

03:02.982 --> 03:05.189
<i>I broke the mold</i>

03:05.251 --> 03:06.821
<i>The girl you see</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:08.658
<i>Is up to me</i>

03:09.589 --> 03:11.694
<i>I'm lifting off the ground</i>

03:13.426 --> 03:17.806
<i>Finding the perfect sound</i>

03:19.065 --> 03:20.601
<i>Here I am</i>

03:20.733 --> 03:22.440
<i>Being who I want</i>

03:22.502 --> 03:23.947
<i>Giving what I got</i>

03:24.671 --> 03:26.378
<i>Never a doubt now</i>

03:26.472 --> 03:27.576
<i>Here I go</i>

03:28.041 --> 03:29.918
<i>Burnin' like a spark</i>

03:30.210 --> 03:32.520
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

03:33.746 --> 03:35.555
<i>Again</i>

03:35.615 --> 03:37.356
<i>Again</i>

03:37.483 --> 03:40.054
<i>Again and again and again</i>

03:46.559 --> 03:48.129
<i>Hey, Meribellal</i>

03:50.763 --> 03:52.333
<i>lam pumped
to be here</i>

03:52.432 --> 03:55.606
<i>performing at your kingdom's
500th anniversary!</i>

03:58.771 --> 04:01.513
<i>Princesses wanna have fun</i>

04:01.841 --> 04:04.321
<i>Oh princesses wanna have fun</i>

04:05.612 --> 04:08.559
<i>There's a star
that's right inside you</i>

04:09.182 --> 04:12.026
<i>So come on and let it out</i>

04:13.453 --> 04:16.399
<i>Find out what you're about
andjust shout</i>

04:16.723 --> 04:18.202
<i>Here I am</i>

04:19.358 --> 04:21.202
<i>Being who I want</i>

04:21.261 --> 04:23.036
<i>Giving what I got</i>

04:23.096 --> 04:25.076
<i>Never a doubt now</i>

04:25.198 --> 04:26.643
<i>Here I go</i>

04:26.733 --> 04:28.542
<i>Burnin' like a spark</i>

04:28.768 --> 04:30.679
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

04:31.237 --> 04:33.717
<i>We just wanna
We just wanna</i>

04:34.974 --> 04:38.183
<i>We just wanna
We just wanna</i>

04:38.444 --> 04:41.653
<i>We just wanna
We just wanna</i>

04:42.248 --> 04:44.250
<i>Princesses wanna have fun</i>

04:44.550 --> 04:45.756
<i>Here I am</i>

04:45.818 --> 04:47.229
<i>Being who I want</i>

04:47.720 --> 04:49.324
<i>Giving what I got</i>

04:49.555 --> 04:51.159
<i>Never a doubt now</i>

04:51.658 --> 04:53.365
<i>Here I go</i>

04:53.426 --> 04:54.928
<i>Burnin' like a spark</i>

04:55.261 --> 04:56.797
<i>Light up the dark</i>

04:56.929 --> 04:58.408
<i>Again</i>

04:59.032 --> 05:00.909
<i>We just wanna</i>

05:01.134 --> 05:03.671
<i>We just wanna
We just wanna</i>

05:03.736 --> 05:04.976
<i>Again and again</i>

05:05.138 --> 05:07.140
<i>And again and again</i>

05:18.951 --> 05:20.624
That was hilarious!

05:21.387 --> 05:23.196
That was the
awesomest thing ever!

05:24.590 --> 05:26.467
Did you see
her face?

05:29.228 --> 05:31.299
I hope we didn't
hurt her feelings.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.742
Oh, she doesn't get hurt
feelings, Meredith.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.144
The main thing is...
Wasn't that great?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.281
Meredith.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.681
Trevi.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.853
Now, you'd both better
scoot to your rooms.

05:49.916 --> 05:53.625
Auntie A will be stomping her
way up Anger Avenue any minute.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.165
See you later!
Bye, Tori!

06:08.768 --> 06:10.714
Keira! Keira! Keira!

06:10.770 --> 06:11.874
Nora!

06:11.938 --> 06:14.441
Tell Phil to kill the snow
on the Fiery Ice intro.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.544
<i>And the drums came in late
again on Rock And Rule...</i>

06:16.642 --> 06:19.122
Remind Kevin that naptime's
after the show, okay?

06:19.178 --> 06:21.124
And what's up with the sets
for the live broadcast?

06:21.180 --> 06:22.386
Here are the designs.
You want the trees

06:22.448 --> 06:23.688
royal purple
or Tokyo violet?

06:23.750 --> 06:24.854
Royal Purple.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.329
And move my Billboard interview to
Saturday, right after the broadcast.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.957
Wonderful show tonight,
Keira, dear!

06:29.021 --> 06:30.432
Your best ever!

06:30.490 --> 06:31.730
I had chills!

06:31.824 --> 06:33.861
Hey, Crider, have you
lined up the cameras?

06:33.993 --> 06:35.301
Um...
The record company

06:35.361 --> 06:38.740
was just a tad concerned
about the budget.

06:38.798 --> 06:39.902
Budget?

06:39.966 --> 06:41.707
Crider, I've been
working my tail off

06:41.768 --> 06:44.112
for the last two years
to get this broadcast.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.877
It'll take my career
to the next level,

06:45.938 --> 06:48.976
which makes it massively
important that it be perfect!

06:49.041 --> 06:51.681
Perfect! Absolutely!
You're so right!

06:52.412 --> 06:54.153
Keira, there's a tea
tomorrow at the castle

06:54.213 --> 06:55.817
for everyone involved
in the festival.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.158
The princess has
requested your presence.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.026
I smell
a photo op!

07:00.420 --> 07:02.593
The princess?
At the castle?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.395
Let's do it.

07:05.691 --> 07:06.863
Daniel!

07:08.361 --> 07:10.841
I need some new choreography
for Saturday's special.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.036
Make it something
like this.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.043
You got it.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.511
Did you forget
where you're going,

07:19.572 --> 07:20.642
or is there
something else?

07:20.740 --> 07:22.151
Well...Yes.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.347
The record company
called again.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.414
And while they loved, loved,
loved your new album photos,

07:27.480 --> 07:28.686
they're, um.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.319
Still wondering when they
can hear some of the, uh...

07:31.384 --> 07:32.522
Songs.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.189
Naturally, as your
manager, I told them...

07:34.253 --> 07:35.789
As my manager,

07:35.855 --> 07:38.233
you told them that the songs
aren't ready to be heard yet.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.037
And that I'll let them
know when they are.

07:41.093 --> 07:42.800
That's exactly
what I told them.

07:42.862 --> 07:45.069
You know,
you work so hard.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.974
Perhaps, you should take a
break, let me run things.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.247
Now, back when my name
was up in lights...

07:50.303 --> 07:51.577
Gotta go, Seymour.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.449
Please don't
call me Seymour.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.625
Guess, I better actually
write those songs.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.760
I don't get it, Riff.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.994
Writing songs
used to be easy.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.661
Fun, even.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.133
If only
I didn't have

08:14.193 --> 08:16.264
all this other garbage.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.569
Lights, sound,

08:17.663 --> 08:19.142
scheduling, payroll, check,

08:19.432 --> 08:20.706
double-check,
make it work!

08:22.735 --> 08:24.043
Don't get me
wrong, Riff.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.777
I mean, I'm a star, I'm
livin' the dream, right?

08:27.006 --> 08:28.076
It's just...

08:28.841 --> 08:31.549
I don't know, sometimes I
wonder what it would be like

08:31.611 --> 08:33.284
to just let go.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.998
Princess Victoria.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.393
Now there's a sweet gig.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.236
Lives in a castle,
everything done for her.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.436
She's probably never
worked a day in her life.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.609
Tori? Tori, open the
door this instant!

09:00.106 --> 09:02.677
Auntie A. Do come in.

09:03.409 --> 09:04.615
Enough is enough!

09:05.211 --> 09:08.658
I promised your dear mother I would
raise you to be a proper princess.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.020
But now you and your
gang of tiny thugs

09:11.083 --> 09:13.085
have turned a royal occasion
into a laughing-stock!

09:14.587 --> 09:15.725
Oh?

09:16.022 --> 09:18.502
Has some misfortune
befallen you?

09:18.691 --> 09:20.693
Don't play the
innocent with me!

09:20.826 --> 09:22.430
This has your mark
all over it.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.734
I was willing to overlook the
exploding cupcakes at tea

09:25.831 --> 09:27.435
and the skunk
at the embassy ball!

09:27.500 --> 09:28.945
I even made excuses

09:29.001 --> 09:31.174
when you hid the
Prime Minister's teeth.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.772
Just his uppers!

09:32.838 --> 09:36.115
Princess Victoria Bethany
Evangeline Renee,

09:36.208 --> 09:38.051
you are almost 18!

09:38.110 --> 09:41.683
It's time you started acting
like a princess of the realm,

09:41.747 --> 09:43.852
not some silly schoolgirl!

09:44.684 --> 09:46.425
Forgive me,
Aunt Amelia.

09:48.621 --> 09:51.033
I'm just having
a bit of fun, that's all.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.506
Fun? You're a Royal.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.873
Duty and responsibility
come before fun.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.271
Have you even begun your
commemoration speech for next week?

10:05.237 --> 10:07.547
Um... Sort of.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.349
Except for the part after
"Ladies and gentlemen."

10:12.078 --> 10:13.421
As I thought!

10:15.081 --> 10:16.719
I'm returning
to our guests.

10:16.816 --> 10:20.093
And since you refuse to
take your duties seriously,

10:20.152 --> 10:21.631
you can just stay
in your room all night

10:21.687 --> 10:23.758
and write that speech.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.769
But, Aunt Amelia...
Not another word!

10:27.727 --> 10:29.263
I am sorry.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.574
Good night, Auntie.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.085
"Ladies and Gentlemen,
distinguished guests,

10:47.179 --> 10:51.423
"500 years ago, our kingdom
began its rule, and..."

10:53.786 --> 10:55.561
Insert speech here.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.730
"You're a Royal,

10:57.790 --> 11:00.703
"duty and responsibility
come before fun."

11:01.394 --> 11:02.429
Ugh.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.942
<i>Look at her</i>

11:11.003 --> 11:13.483
<i>In the spotlight</i>

11:13.539 --> 11:15.712
<i>I love her purple hair</i>

11:15.941 --> 11:17.511
<i>She can do</i>

11:17.777 --> 11:19.654
<i>What she wants to</i>

11:19.712 --> 11:22.215
<i>As crazy as she dares</i>

11:22.281 --> 11:26.195
<i>She doesn't
need to be polite</i>

11:27.553 --> 11:29.829
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

11:30.790 --> 11:33.430
<i>Then I would be so free</i>

11:33.993 --> 11:35.768
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

11:37.263 --> 11:39.243
<i>I'd be another me</i>

11:44.904 --> 11:46.474
<i>Look at her</i>

11:46.539 --> 11:48.678
<i>In the throne room</i>

11:48.774 --> 11:50.845
<i>Every hair just right</i>

11:51.177 --> 11:52.850
<i>She has tea</i>

11:52.912 --> 11:54.687
<i>In the morning</i>

11:55.147 --> 11:57.650
<i>And bon bons every night</i>

11:58.350 --> 12:02.059
<i>Wouldn't that be nice?</i>

12:02.988 --> 12:05.366
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

12:06.192 --> 12:08.331
<i>Then I would be so free</i>

12:09.361 --> 12:11.967
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

12:12.565 --> 12:14.977
<i>I'd be another me</i>

12:20.506 --> 12:22.611
<i>They'd do my nails</i>

12:23.676 --> 12:25.815
<i>I'd stroll the grounds</i>

12:27.346 --> 12:29.485
<i>I would wear</i>

12:30.116 --> 12:32.858
<i>Whatever</i>

12:33.452 --> 12:34.954
<i>And then I'd rock</i>

12:36.322 --> 12:38.962
<i>Have time for me</i>

12:39.825 --> 12:43.534
<i>It just might happen</i>

12:44.230 --> 12:46.039
<i>Never</i>

12:48.134 --> 12:50.842
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

12:51.704 --> 12:54.116
<i>Then I would be so free</i>

12:55.007 --> 12:58.079
<i>And everything
would suddenly be</i>

12:58.144 --> 13:00.647
<i>Just the way that
I dreamed it could be</i>

13:00.846 --> 13:03.884
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

13:04.383 --> 13:07.125
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

13:08.220 --> 13:10.632
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

13:11.056 --> 13:13.434
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

13:14.293 --> 13:16.034
<i>Oh</i>

13:17.496 --> 13:19.908
<i>Oh</i>

13:20.399 --> 13:23.608
<i>So beautiful and bright</i>

13:23.803 --> 13:26.613
<i>I wish I had her life</i>

13:40.653 --> 13:42.530
Trust me, sir,
Keira's new songs

13:42.588 --> 13:45.091
are fabulous,
best she's ever written!

13:45.157 --> 13:47.763
Shejust, er,
needs a little more time.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.431
I've been helping her
as best I can,

13:49.495 --> 13:51.668
but you know
how these stars are.

13:53.098 --> 13:54.736
As a former star myself,

13:54.800 --> 13:56.074
I can tell you...

13:56.135 --> 13:59.878
<i>Crider, your job is to keep
that little diva in line!</i>

14:00.306 --> 14:04.083
<i>You tell her if I don't hear some new
hit tunes on the broadcast Saturday,</i>

14:04.143 --> 14:06.987
<i>she can start looking
for another record company!</i>

14:07.213 --> 14:08.715
But, but, Mr. Limburger...

14:08.781 --> 14:09.987
<i>And you can go back</i>

14:10.082 --> 14:13.291
<i>to managing Uncle Herman
and His Talking Pig!</i>

14:16.522 --> 14:19.264
Thai vappy Pig
still owes me 40 bucks.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.463
What in the...
Argh!

14:28.267 --> 14:29.439
Rupert!

14:29.702 --> 14:32.080
Something you wanted,
Mr. Crider?

14:32.571 --> 14:34.141
Oh, you found it!

14:35.307 --> 14:38.186
Still got a good few
chews left, looks like.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.048
Get it off.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.991
Oh, right.
Quick as a bunny.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.794
"Keep that little diva
in line," he says.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.491
How am I supposed to make that
whiny warbler do anything?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.556
She runs the show
like a drill sergeant!

14:50.623 --> 14:51.761
"Crider, curl my wigs!

14:51.824 --> 14:53.303
"Crider, take my breath mint!

14:53.359 --> 14:54.929
"Crider, stop stealing
my jewelry!"

14:54.994 --> 14:56.769
Things were different
when I was a star...

14:57.963 --> 15:00.273
I mean, back then, people
respected real talent.

15:01.033 --> 15:02.034
Ah!

15:05.271 --> 15:06.272
Ow!

15:07.006 --> 15:08.007
Oh.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.514
Rupert, do you know
I was beloved?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.715
Yeah, yeah.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.552
A beloved idol of millions.

15:14.613 --> 15:17.389
I was the beloved
idol of millions.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.155
The finest boy singer on the
Chipper Chipmunk Show.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.665
Until...

15:22.721 --> 15:24.530
That tragic day.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.898
<i>I'm a chipper chipmunk</i>

15:36.235 --> 15:37.771
And that was that.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.282
My singing career was over.
Kaput. Finished.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.612
A has been at 14.

15:42.841 --> 15:45.048
To this day I have
nightmares of chipmunks,

15:45.110 --> 15:47.147
their toothy smiles
taunting me.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.586
A tragic tale,
Mr. Crider.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.185
I get a lump in me throat
every time you tell it.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.026
Which is quite a bit.

15:54.086 --> 15:56.965
It's all so...
So very unfair, Rupert.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.802
If only somehow I had the
means to restart my career.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.973
All I need is
one lucky break.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.107
Or a rich widow.

16:12.671 --> 16:14.742
Oh, Mr. Crider,
how you go on!

16:16.141 --> 16:19.054
But surely you must
have been a ballerina!

16:19.345 --> 16:20.881
That form, that grace!

16:22.147 --> 16:24.423
Oh, you are
such a ï¬‚atterer!

16:25.084 --> 16:27.462
And you say you were
a singer on this...

16:27.553 --> 16:29.624
"Squeaky Squirrel" show?

16:30.255 --> 16:31.563
Chipmunk.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.193
"Chipper Chipmunk."

16:33.258 --> 16:35.260
But I don't like
to talk about myself.

16:39.064 --> 16:43.035
And this drought has been
hard on the entire region.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.775
Our reservoirs are
only 30% of normal,

16:46.972 --> 16:49.748
and our vineyards
are withering.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.152
Your Royal Highness,
may I present

16:53.212 --> 16:54.714
Miss Keira.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.686
This is so cool!

16:58.017 --> 17:00.327
So you're a real
live princess.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.292
Awesome.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.458
You're Keira!

17:03.622 --> 17:07.035
I am absolutely your
very biggest fan ever!

17:07.326 --> 17:08.771
Thanks.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.234
Would you like a tour?

17:10.295 --> 17:11.365
Love to!

17:11.763 --> 17:15.007
But aren't you supposed to
be hostessing or something?

17:15.467 --> 17:16.945
Oh. Right.

17:17.002 --> 17:18.276
Um...

17:18.569 --> 17:20.208
Look, everyone!

17:20.406 --> 17:22.646
An all you can eat
caviar buffet!

17:26.878 --> 17:27.880
Hello!

17:29.148 --> 17:31.059
I'm Prince Li... Hmm.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.170
This way,
we'll start with my room.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.535
Ta-da!

17:47.032 --> 17:48.136
Whoa.

17:50.869 --> 17:52.815
There's more me in here
than in my house.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.851
Mmm-hmm.
Your guitar,

17:54.907 --> 17:57.148
your albums,
most of your fashion line.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.087
I wore this in my
first music video.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.318
It's still
my very favorite!

18:02.881 --> 18:04.519
<i>Here I am</i>

18:04.583 --> 18:06.085
<i>Being who I want</i>

18:06.151 --> 18:07.926
<i>Giving what I got</i>

18:08.120 --> 18:09.929
<i>Never a doubt now</i>

18:11.790 --> 18:13.428
<i>Here I go</i>

18:13.525 --> 18:15.198
<i>Burnin' like a spark</i>

18:15.294 --> 18:17.706
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

18:20.199 --> 18:21.872
Not too shabby
for a princess.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.605
Hey, want to join me
on stage for a number?

18:25.671 --> 18:27.173
The tabloids will go nuts.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.119
Thanks,
but I'm no performer.

18:30.242 --> 18:32.552
I'd be freaked
to face a real audience.

18:32.678 --> 18:33.850
But you...

18:34.113 --> 18:35.558
You must love it.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.560
Sure, it's all
I ever wanted.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.194
But, I dunno, it used
to be more about music.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.864
Now, it's different.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.963
But, Keira,
you're a star!

18:48.494 --> 18:50.337
And you're a princess!

18:50.729 --> 18:53.733
When I was little, I always
dreamed of being a princess!

18:53.832 --> 18:56.073
I'd be wearing
a ball gown and a tiara.

18:56.535 --> 18:58.208
Want to try mine?

19:02.908 --> 19:04.114
Riff!

19:04.209 --> 19:05.620
Use your inside bark!

19:11.016 --> 19:12.324
Sorry.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.590
He's my baby.
I bring him everywhere.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.131
Riff, Sit!

19:17.990 --> 19:19.799
He's cute.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.771
Look, Vanessa, Keira
brought a friend for you!

19:28.567 --> 19:31.207
I read you've been performing
since you were six.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.839
When I was six, my biggest
job was keeping my tiara...

19:34.139 --> 19:35.846
Hi! Nice digs.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.251
I'm Riff! Who are you?

19:38.110 --> 19:40.522
I am Vanessa Victoria
Fluffy-pie.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.750
Are you always like this?

19:43.081 --> 19:45.425
Like what?
Got any squeaky toys?

19:45.484 --> 19:46.656
Soggy tennis balls?

19:46.718 --> 19:48.254
Mmm, you smell nice!

19:49.955 --> 19:51.025
There.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.432
Oh, yeah.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.404
And I've got just
the outfit to go with it.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.770
Formal gown number nine!

20:01.166 --> 20:03.840
Oh. So that's how you
make those quick changes!

20:04.069 --> 20:05.946
A magic microphone!

20:06.338 --> 20:08.511
I have something
like that.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.346
Keira pop hair
number five!

20:14.446 --> 20:16.187
A magic hairbrush!

20:16.448 --> 20:17.756
Very cool.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.386
New hairdo's for every

20:19.451 --> 20:21.055
royal occasion.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.156
And a few non-royal ones!

20:26.625 --> 20:29.538
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:45.344 --> 20:47.722
You look just like me!

20:47.779 --> 20:49.258
Whoa!

20:49.348 --> 20:50.691
There you are!

20:50.749 --> 20:51.921
Huh?
Huh?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.554
The guests are all
asking about you!

20:53.619 --> 20:55.599
You need to
return at once!

20:55.954 --> 20:57.729
Oh, no, no, I'm...

20:57.789 --> 21:00.201
Princess Tori,
of Meribella!

21:00.259 --> 21:01.897
Your Highness!

21:04.730 --> 21:05.731
Whoa...

21:11.403 --> 21:12.882
This can't be good.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.616
Are you kidding?
It's delicious!

21:19.678 --> 21:21.419
Now. Mingle.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.419
Yoo-hoo!

21:24.483 --> 21:26.588
Oh, Mister Crider!

21:27.286 --> 21:29.391
Ready for an
awesome entrance...

21:29.488 --> 21:30.831
Princess?

21:34.559 --> 21:37.233
Oh, man, it's just
like I dreamed.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.667
Her Royal Highness,

21:39.898 --> 21:43.607
Princess Victoria Bethany
Evangeline Renee

21:43.669 --> 21:46.013
has returned!

22:06.191 --> 22:07.295
Whoa!

22:07.559 --> 22:08.765
Whoa!

22:17.369 --> 22:18.677
Are you all right,
Your Highness?

22:18.737 --> 22:19.977
Did you break anything?

22:20.038 --> 22:22.314
I mean,
besides my spleen.

22:22.874 --> 22:24.353
I'm good.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.118
Nobody saw that, right?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.681
Pff, you kidding?
It's our secret.

22:29.314 --> 22:30.588
Tori! Tori!

22:30.649 --> 22:31.650
Who?

22:32.050 --> 22:33.552
Are you hurt?

22:34.052 --> 22:35.759
Oh, I'm fine. Really.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.823
I'm great, Mister, uh...

22:37.889 --> 22:39.027
Father.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.627
Mister Father.

22:41.326 --> 22:44.000
Thank goodness!
You had me worried.

22:48.567 --> 22:49.773
Keira?

22:49.835 --> 22:51.246
Yes?

22:51.603 --> 22:53.139
I'm a huge fan!

22:53.338 --> 22:54.681
Me too!

22:54.740 --> 22:56.117
Not as big as Tori,
mind you.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.846
Oh, thank you.
What lovely stationery?

23:02.114 --> 23:03.286
Autograph.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.294
Oh! Of course!
An autograph.

23:07.786 --> 23:10.562
Here you go.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.562
"Love Tori"?

23:20.232 --> 23:22.337
We never did
finish our tour!

23:22.401 --> 23:24.472
Oh, but actually,
you're the princess today,

23:24.536 --> 23:26.516
so you should
give the tour.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.812
As you wish,
Your Highness.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.452
And this priceless
silver-handle fan

23:32.511 --> 23:36.118
was a gift from the King of
Spain to my great grandmama.

23:36.815 --> 23:39.261
You know, they were
quite the item.

23:39.317 --> 23:40.387
Hmm,

23:40.452 --> 23:41.829
delicate yet saucy.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.922
Not unlike you,
my dear Duchess.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.265
Or, may I call you,
Amelia?

23:46.591 --> 23:50.061
Oh, Mr. Crider,
please do!

23:51.229 --> 23:54.972
And to our left is the future
site of the Royal Taco Hut.

23:55.467 --> 23:58.380
Actually, it is
something pretty cool.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.007
Can you keep a secret?

24:00.071 --> 24:01.880
A mondo big one?

24:02.507 --> 24:04.009
Uh, sure.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.420
If you can't trust a fake
princess, who can you trust?

24:25.597 --> 24:26.974
Follow me.

24:56.428 --> 24:57.873
Wow.

24:57.929 --> 25:00.239
This is definitely
no Taco Hut.

25:01.199 --> 25:02.837
It's a Diamond Gardenia.

25:02.901 --> 25:05.939
It's 500 years old
and it grows real diamonds!

25:06.004 --> 25:08.075
Most of our people
think it's just a legend.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.244
Except for the Royal Family

25:10.308 --> 25:12.083
and now you.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.324
And the tiny
flying people?

25:15.981 --> 25:19.224
They're garden fairies. They
take care of all the plants.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.161
Oh, they're adorable.

25:25.223 --> 25:29.296
Yes, but they get rather cranky
if you mess with the gardenia.

25:30.562 --> 25:32.599
It blooms just once
every five years.

25:32.664 --> 25:36.976
It's diamonds help pay for
schools and you know, stuff.

25:38.169 --> 25:41.912
Now, over here is a rare,
black pearl letter opener.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.246
Hmm. Curious.

25:47.779 --> 25:50.988
Mr. Crider, excuse me
for just a moment.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.663
Now, don't move a muscle.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.823
Not a pinky, Amelia.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.329
Keira, look!

26:23.214 --> 26:25.717
Hey, thanks,
tiny dancers!

26:26.284 --> 26:27.627
These rock.

26:27.819 --> 26:30.265
These will be our
friendship necklaces.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.392
Tori?

26:33.391 --> 26:36.270
Are you mad, bringing
an outsider in here?

26:36.828 --> 26:38.273
You know the rules.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.571
No one but the Royal Family
is allowed in this garden!

26:40.632 --> 26:43.579
And you reveal it
to a perfect stranger?

26:44.169 --> 26:45.671
CRIDERI Oh...

26:47.672 --> 26:48.946
Now hold on!

26:49.007 --> 26:51.487
You can't talk that way
to Keira's friend,

26:51.543 --> 26:52.681
the princess,

26:53.311 --> 26:54.949
and if the princess
could speak,

26:55.013 --> 26:58.426
which she can't because
she's, er, speechless,

26:58.650 --> 27:00.630
she would say
that you are being

27:00.719 --> 27:03.461
a royal party pooper!

27:05.123 --> 27:06.761
I rest my case.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.435
Oh.

27:11.029 --> 27:14.340
Sometimes I don't know
who that girl is!

27:24.743 --> 27:26.381
Problem, my dear?

27:27.345 --> 27:29.325
You wouldn't believe it.

27:29.414 --> 27:33.362
Now, where were we
with our tour?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.098
I believe I was
telling you

27:36.154 --> 27:39.465
how radiant you look
in every room of the castle.

27:48.099 --> 27:50.773
That was close!

27:51.136 --> 27:52.979
I thought she'd
ground us both!

27:53.138 --> 27:56.210
That may be the scariest
woman I've ever met.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.780
And today was a good day!

27:59.044 --> 28:00.352
Look, this was awesome,

28:00.412 --> 28:02.358
but I've got a tour
to obsess over,

28:02.414 --> 28:05.827
so let's change back before
your Aunt gets any more...

28:21.533 --> 28:23.911
Well, thank goodness
that silliness is over!

28:24.269 --> 28:25.339
Silliness?

28:25.403 --> 28:26.780
Silliness?
What silliness?

28:26.871 --> 28:28.214
Do you like bacon?

28:29.407 --> 28:31.444
Why does it have to end?

28:32.143 --> 28:33.554
Well, for one thing,

28:33.611 --> 28:35.352
I've got a concert
to do tonight.

28:35.413 --> 28:37.723
Not to mention contracts
to sign, an interview...

28:37.782 --> 28:39.352
But what about tomorrow?

28:39.451 --> 28:41.089
We could change
places in the morning,

28:41.152 --> 28:43.928
and spend the whole day
being each other!

28:44.222 --> 28:47.669
Oh, this is a bad idea
on so many levels.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.366
I know just what you mean.

28:49.427 --> 28:51.668
Wait, no I don't.
Ah! There's that tail.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.335
Look, I really don't think...

28:54.432 --> 28:56.139
Keira, wouldn't
it be amazing

28:56.234 --> 28:59.408
just for one day to take
a break from being you?

29:00.004 --> 29:01.415
Tori...

29:01.573 --> 29:03.052
It'd be magical!

29:03.274 --> 29:06.118
I'd get to be a pop star
for a whole day!

29:06.177 --> 29:09.021
And you'd get
to be a princess!

29:11.549 --> 29:13.085
Let's do it!

29:23.161 --> 29:24.970
This is gonna be great!

29:25.663 --> 29:28.200
But I don't know the first
thing about being a princess.

29:28.666 --> 29:29.804
It's easy!

29:29.868 --> 29:32.610
All you have to do
is follow a few simple rules.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.711
<i>To be a princess</i>

29:36.775 --> 29:39.153
<i>Is to know which spoon to use</i>

29:39.744 --> 29:40.950
<i>To be a princess</i>

29:41.012 --> 29:42.719
<i>Is a thousand pairs of shoes!</i>

29:43.181 --> 29:45.183
<i>Have your breakfast
served in bed</i>

29:45.250 --> 29:47.252
<i>Wear some diamonds
on your head</i>

29:47.318 --> 29:48.524
<i>Get a foot massage</i>

29:48.586 --> 29:50.361
<i>And mani-pedi too</i>

29:51.890 --> 29:55.929
<i>To be a princess
is to live a dream come true</i>

29:59.597 --> 30:01.599
<i>Curtsey when princes
come to call</i>

30:01.666 --> 30:03.612
<i>Wear a new gown
to every ball</i>

30:03.668 --> 30:05.409
<i>AH through the day
there's just one way</i>

30:05.503 --> 30:07.608
<i>You must behave</i>

30:07.705 --> 30:09.514
<i>Pose with a feather
in your hat</i>

30:09.574 --> 30:11.520
<i>Stretch on a golden yoga mat</i>

30:11.776 --> 30:13.915
<i>Bend from above
and always wear your gloves</i>

30:14.479 --> 30:16.459
<i>And wave!</i>

30:16.848 --> 30:18.828
<i>Shoulders back
And tummy in and</i>

30:19.083 --> 30:20.790
<i>Pinky out and
Lift the chin and</i>

30:21.085 --> 30:23.964
<i>Slowly turn your head
from side to side</i>

30:24.889 --> 30:26.869
<i>Breathing gently
Stepping lightly</i>

30:26.925 --> 30:29.098
<i>Smile brightly
Nod politely</i>

30:29.160 --> 30:31.970
<i>Do everything
you do with pride</i>

30:32.697 --> 30:33.971
<i>Glide!</i>

30:34.966 --> 30:36.445
<i>To be a princess</i>

30:36.501 --> 30:38.606
<i>Is to wear your family crest</i>

30:39.204 --> 30:40.547
<i>To be a princess</i>

30:40.605 --> 30:42.983
<i>Is to always do your best.</i>

30:51.282 --> 30:52.818
<i>To be a popstar</i>

30:52.917 --> 30:54.760
<i>Is to know which mic to use</i>

30:55.119 --> 30:56.359
<i>To be a popstar</i>

30:56.421 --> 30:58.628
<i>Is to not fall off your shoes</i>

30:58.790 --> 31:00.895
<i>To rehearse until it's right</i>

31:00.959 --> 31:02.870
<i>Give a great show every night</i>

31:02.927 --> 31:06.238
<i>And have room service
with anything you choose</i>

31:07.232 --> 31:08.973
<i>To be a popstar</i>

31:09.033 --> 31:11.309
<i>Is to love your great reviews</i>

31:15.173 --> 31:17.210
<i>Take in the latest
fashion show</i>

31:17.308 --> 31:19.185
<i>Fly for a lunch to Mexico</i>

31:19.310 --> 31:21.221
<i>No time for friends
except your dog</i>

31:21.279 --> 31:23.020
<i>And your guitar</i>

31:23.147 --> 31:25.252
<i>Tweet everyone
your latest news</i>

31:25.316 --> 31:27.262
<i>Sit for a thousand interviews</i>

31:27.385 --> 31:28.659
<i>Love every fan</i>

31:28.720 --> 31:31.462
<i>No matter how bizarre they are</i>

31:31.990 --> 31:33.526
<i>Here's a camera</i>

31:33.591 --> 31:34.934
<i>There's a camera</i>

31:34.993 --> 31:36.666
<i>And a camera and a camera</i>

31:36.728 --> 31:38.503
<i>And another autograph to sign</i>

31:38.596 --> 31:40.200
<i>Love Keira</i>

31:40.531 --> 31:42.511
<i>Change your clothes
and strike a pose and</i>

31:42.567 --> 31:44.672
<i>Work the crowd and
take a bow and</i>

31:44.736 --> 31:47.512
<i>Don't forget to
post it all online</i>

31:48.273 --> 31:49.684
<i>Shine!</i>

31:50.808 --> 31:52.287
<i>To be a popstar</i>

31:52.343 --> 31:54.584
<i>Is to never act your age</i>

31:54.646 --> 31:56.387
<i>To be a popstar</i>

31:56.447 --> 31:59.985
<i>Is to make the world
your stage</i>

32:06.391 --> 32:07.529
<i>Shoulders back and</i>

32:07.692 --> 32:08.727
<i>Strike a pose and</i>

32:08.927 --> 32:09.928
<i>Pinky out and</i>

32:10.028 --> 32:11.234
<i>Change your clothes and</i>

32:11.296 --> 32:13.037
<i>Slowly turn your head
from side to side</i>

32:13.164 --> 32:14.643
<i>{see now</i>

32:14.799 --> 32:15.903
<i>Here's a camera</i>

32:16.000 --> 32:17.035
<i>Stepping lightly</i>

32:17.135 --> 32:18.136
<i>There's a camera</i>

32:18.202 --> 32:19.408
<i>Nod politely</i>

32:19.470 --> 32:22.576
<i>Do everything
you do with pride</i>

32:22.640 --> 32:24.142
<i>Glide!</i>

32:25.109 --> 32:26.315
<i>To be a princess</i>

32:26.377 --> 32:28.857
<i>Is to always do your best</i>

32:28.913 --> 32:30.324
<i>To be a popstar</i>

32:30.381 --> 32:33.590
<i>Is to leave them all</i>

32:33.952 --> 32:37.297
<i>Impressed</i>

32:42.393 --> 32:43.667
Ready?

32:44.062 --> 32:45.473
Ready.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.670
You should have seen
those diamonds, Rupert!

32:50.735 --> 32:53.181
Hundreds of them, just
sitting there, glittering!

32:53.338 --> 32:55.545
Me, I don't hold
with littering.

32:55.606 --> 32:58.382
Back in the day, Mick and
Keith would always tell me

32:58.509 --> 33:00.955
"Litter free, that's for me."

33:01.546 --> 33:02.786
Ow.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.620
Glittering, not
littering, you baboon!

33:05.683 --> 33:07.253
Would you please listen?

33:07.318 --> 33:08.661
Ah...

33:09.120 --> 33:10.463
I can hear the ocean.

33:10.521 --> 33:11.966
It's like they were
calling my name.

33:12.023 --> 33:14.594
"Crider! Handsome,
talented superstar!

33:14.659 --> 33:15.899
"Take us away!"

33:16.094 --> 33:18.199
With those diamonds, I could
afford to mount a stage show

33:18.262 --> 33:19.707
that would put me back
in the spotlight,

33:19.764 --> 33:23.007
and finally chase that cheesy
chipmunk out of my dreams.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.277
There must be a way.

33:26.704 --> 33:28.342
<i>Sun's up</i>

33:28.439 --> 33:30.817
<i>A little after 12:00</i>

33:31.509 --> 33:34.490
<i>Make breakfast for myself</i>

33:34.645 --> 33:37.387
Leave the work
for someone else

33:38.483 --> 33:39.928
<i>People say</i>

33:41.085 --> 33:43.656
<i>They say that
it's just a phase</i>

33:43.955 --> 33:46.868
<i>They tell me to act my age</i>

33:47.358 --> 33:49.031
<i>Well I am!</i>

33:50.828 --> 33:53.672
<i>On this perfect day</i>

33:54.332 --> 33:56.903
<i>Nothing's standing in my way</i>

33:57.035 --> 33:59.242
<i>On this perfect day</i>

34:00.471 --> 34:03.042
<i>When nothing can go wrong</i>

34:03.274 --> 34:05.777
<i>It's the perfect day</i>

34:06.644 --> 34:09.487
<i>Tomorrow's gonna come too soon</i>

34:10.047 --> 34:12.255
<i>I could stay</i>

34:13.016 --> 34:15.121
<i>Forever as I am</i>

34:15.585 --> 34:19.591
<i>On this perfect day</i>

34:22.592 --> 34:24.197
<i> Sun's down</i>

34:24.661 --> 34:26.835
<i>A little after 10:00</i>

34:27.831 --> 34:29.572
<i>I pick up all my friends</i>

34:30.534 --> 34:33.447
<i>In my Mercedes Benz</i>

34:34.906 --> 34:36.010
<i>Wake up</i>

34:37.141 --> 34:39.052
<i>Don't tell me
it's just a dream</i>

34:40.110 --> 34:42.091
<i>'Cause when I've had enough</i>

34:42.179 --> 34:44.091
<i>You'll hear me say</i>

34:44.148 --> 34:46.492
<i>Now don't you try
to rain on my</i>

34:47.485 --> 34:49.123
<i> Perfect day</i>

34:50.455 --> 34:52.900
<i>Nothing's standing
in my way</i>

34:52.956 --> 34:55.027
<i>On this perfect day</i>

34:56.594 --> 34:59.165
<i>When nothing can go wrong</i>

34:59.597 --> 35:02.100
<i>It's the perfect day</i>

35:02.934 --> 35:05.505
<i>Tomorrow's gonna
come too soon</i>

35:06.170 --> 35:09.014
<i>I could stay</i>

35:09.107 --> 35:11.451
<i>Forever as I am</i>

35:11.843 --> 35:13.914
<i>On this perfect day</i>

35:28.192 --> 35:30.934
<i>I'm in the race
but I've already won</i>

35:31.129 --> 35:33.939
<i>And getting there
can be half the fun</i>

35:34.265 --> 35:37.144
<i>So don't stop me
till I'm good and done</i>

35:37.201 --> 35:40.375
<i>Don't you try to rain on my</i>

35:40.438 --> 35:44.113
<i>Perfect day</i>

35:44.175 --> 35:46.121
<i>Perfect day</i>

35:46.177 --> 35:51.286
<i>On this perfect day</i>

35:51.349 --> 35:52.589
<i>Yeah!</i>

35:52.650 --> 35:56.393
<i>On this perfect day</i>

36:03.261 --> 36:04.638
Keira! Keira!

36:04.695 --> 36:07.869
You never said which headpiece for
the Smoke And Mirrors number.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.138
Oh, I don't know.
You choose.

36:10.201 --> 36:11.612
Surprise me!

36:11.802 --> 36:14.282
Uh... I choose?

36:16.240 --> 36:18.186
Come on, Riff.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.482
I can't remember
the last time

36:22.547 --> 36:25.050
I just strolled
through Meribella.

36:31.088 --> 36:32.260
You're "it"!

36:36.160 --> 36:37.605
Tori! Come play!

36:37.728 --> 36:40.299
Oh, no, no,
that's okay.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.076
You guys are
having fun.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.409
C'mon! You're "it"!
You're "it"!

36:45.336 --> 36:46.474
Confession.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.143
I'm not 100% sure
how to play this.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.150
You've played it
a billion times!

36:51.209 --> 36:52.779
More than that!
A zillion!

36:53.077 --> 36:54.852
Just try to find us!

36:55.546 --> 36:56.889
Okay, go!

37:09.126 --> 37:12.403
Huh. I don't remember ever being
around here before, Riff.

37:17.501 --> 37:18.844
Excuse me!

37:18.903 --> 37:21.247
Can you tell me the way
back to the marina?

37:21.305 --> 37:22.978
Hey, you're Keira!

37:23.040 --> 37:24.417
Look, Charlotte!
Keira!

37:25.109 --> 37:26.247
Awesome!

37:26.310 --> 37:28.051
Hey, can you
sign my T-shirt?

37:28.145 --> 37:31.456
I really, really wanted
to go see your concert!

37:31.515 --> 37:33.654
Well, there's one more
show tomorrow night,

37:33.718 --> 37:36.324
maybe you can still
see her, er, me.

37:36.721 --> 37:37.893
I wish!

37:37.989 --> 37:39.832
But my dad says
we can't afford it.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.002
Mine, too.
Bummer, huh?

37:42.660 --> 37:44.901
Lots of folks can't
afford stuff right now.

37:45.463 --> 37:47.943
You know,
since the big drought.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.542
Drought? Is that
still going on?

37:50.668 --> 37:53.706
Oh, yeah. It wiped out
all the vineyards this year.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.547
Dad says everyone's
struggling to get by.

37:56.974 --> 37:58.647
I... Didn't know.

37:59.343 --> 38:02.790
Well, I guess you'd have to live
in Meribella to know about it.

38:03.514 --> 38:04.788
Yes.

38:04.849 --> 38:06.556
I guess you would.

38:11.422 --> 38:12.560
Gotcha!

38:20.031 --> 38:22.033
That was awesome!

38:22.333 --> 38:24.745
But we'd better all
get ready for tonight.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.212
Okay.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.409
Are you gonna keep
pretending to be Tori?

38:28.472 --> 38:29.644
What?

38:29.874 --> 38:31.911
On earth? Are you...

38:33.177 --> 38:34.315
You know?

38:34.679 --> 38:35.817
Of course.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.554
If you were Tori, you would
have cheated by now.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.618
It's okay.
We won't tell.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.459
Pillow fight!

38:57.702 --> 39:00.808
And then I sneezed every last
petal off that lady's flower!

39:01.305 --> 39:03.376
Who knew I was
allergic to dahlias?

39:03.674 --> 39:06.018
<i>And I
must have tried on</i>

39:06.077 --> 39:08.148
<i>every single one
of your costumes!</i>

39:08.512 --> 39:11.356
Poor Nora is convinced
you've gone loco!

39:11.782 --> 39:13.352
<i>Oh, speaking of loco,</i>

39:13.417 --> 39:17.194
<i>your aunt is all up in my face
about practicing some speech.</i>

39:17.254 --> 39:20.064
Oh, that. The dreaded
commemoration speech.

39:20.758 --> 39:22.669
I don't suppose
you'd like to give it?

39:22.827 --> 39:25.706
And by give it,
I also mean write it.

39:26.163 --> 39:27.767
Only if I can sing it.

39:28.399 --> 39:29.844
You know,
I've gotta tell you...

39:30.034 --> 39:32.640
<i>This has been the
coolest day I've had in...</i>

39:33.003 --> 39:34.004
<i>Forever.</i>

39:34.071 --> 39:36.517
Oh, me, too!
It's been amazing.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.053
I learned more about
my kingdom today

39:38.109 --> 39:40.419
than I have in the
last 17 years!

39:40.945 --> 39:43.050
Yeah. Too bad
this day is over.

39:44.415 --> 39:45.587
Unless...

39:45.816 --> 39:48.660
You'd want to keep it
going one more day?

39:49.854 --> 39:51.060
You're on.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.326
Perfect!

39:52.390 --> 39:53.664
The live broadcast
is tomorrow,

39:53.724 --> 39:55.101
<i>so we'll need to
change back early.</i>

39:55.326 --> 39:56.634
Of course.

39:56.694 --> 39:59.402
I only wish more people could
afford to go to your show.

39:59.463 --> 40:01.704
Seems like they're a lot
worse off than I knew.

40:02.099 --> 40:05.342
Well, how about we make
the last concert a free one?

40:05.669 --> 40:06.807
<i>I'll work out
the details.</i>

40:06.904 --> 40:10.408
For reals?
Oh, thank you so much!

40:10.808 --> 40:14.221
<i>Hey, it's the least a princess
can do for you common folk.</i>

40:14.345 --> 40:15.619
<i>See you tomorrow, Tori!</i>

40:26.223 --> 40:28.829
And that goes
for Mrs. Limburger, too!

40:29.360 --> 40:31.567
<i>What? Why, you...</i>

40:31.695 --> 40:33.902
<i>Crider, you're through!</i>

40:34.832 --> 40:37.369
Through with you
and on to stardom!

40:37.468 --> 40:38.879
I'm taking off, baby.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.644
Like a super nova
on top of a shooting star!

40:41.705 --> 40:43.514
You can't handle this.

40:43.741 --> 40:46.915
But you can handle the
broadcast all by yourself!

40:48.512 --> 40:51.356
I love show business!

40:51.816 --> 40:54.194
You mean you're not gonna
stay for the show tonight?

40:54.251 --> 40:57.323
Ugh, I've had it with playing
nursemaid to that prima donna.

40:57.388 --> 40:58.492
I've got a new career
to launch!

40:59.323 --> 41:00.996
Once I get those
diamonds tonight,

41:01.058 --> 41:02.833
it's gonna be
"See ya later!"

41:02.993 --> 41:04.939
Picture it, Rupert.
Up there in lights.

41:04.995 --> 41:07.271
"Crider!
The Legend Returns!"

41:07.531 --> 41:11.206
With Rupert, his bestest
buddy and life-long pal.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.313
Now, let's see...
Expenses.

41:13.370 --> 41:15.509
I'll need new songs, backup
singers, a swagger coach,

41:15.573 --> 41:18.247
gold fillings... No, no,
no, diamond fillings!

41:20.678 --> 41:23.625
Tonight we go back
and grab that plant!

41:23.681 --> 41:24.955
Everyone will be
at the concert,

41:25.015 --> 41:27.188
so the castle will be
practically empty.

41:32.189 --> 41:34.328
Look how high we can fly!

41:35.993 --> 41:38.564
"Look how high we can fly."

41:43.000 --> 41:45.913
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

41:59.984 --> 42:02.430
<i>I lost myself today</i>

42:02.520 --> 42:04.693
<i>All work no time to play</i>

42:04.989 --> 42:08.095
<i>I'm holding on to what I know</i>

42:09.894 --> 42:12.067
<i>Then this discovery</i>

42:12.363 --> 42:14.809
<i>Blindfolded, I could see</i>

42:14.865 --> 42:17.846
<i>I'm catching on
by letting go</i>

42:18.569 --> 42:21.015
<i>And now I'm rising up</i>

42:21.438 --> 42:23.645
<i>No coming down</i>

42:23.941 --> 42:27.150
<i>So hang on for the ride</i>

42:27.511 --> 42:29.752
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

42:29.813 --> 42:32.259
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

42:32.316 --> 42:34.421
<i>We can see everything</i>

42:34.785 --> 42:36.822
<i>From up here in the sky</i>

42:37.087 --> 42:39.431
We've got the perfect view

42:39.490 --> 42:41.766
<i>Together me and you</i>

42:42.192 --> 42:45.002
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

42:49.433 --> 42:51.504
<i>Words come so easily</i>

42:51.902 --> 42:54.348
<i>Hard to believe it's me</i>

42:54.405 --> 42:57.045
<i>With every breath
the feeling grows</i>

42:59.276 --> 43:01.483
<i>Take time to make time stop</i>

43:01.812 --> 43:04.088
<i>Unplug, turn off the clock</i>

43:04.315 --> 43:07.228
<i>The less you try
the more it flows</i>

43:09.386 --> 43:13.425
<i>I don't need to live
in a fancy castle</i>

43:13.924 --> 43:17.167
<i>That isn't where I should be</i>

43:19.129 --> 43:23.202
<i>Open up my heart and where
it leads I'll follow</i>

43:23.767 --> 43:26.748
<i>Up high where I can be free</i>

43:26.804 --> 43:29.182
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

43:29.239 --> 43:31.515
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

43:31.609 --> 43:33.953
<i>We can see everything</i>

43:34.011 --> 43:35.922
<i>From up here in the sky</i>

43:36.780 --> 43:38.987
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

43:39.049 --> 43:41.495
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

43:41.585 --> 43:43.758
<i>We can surf on the wind</i>

43:44.021 --> 43:45.762
<i>So completely alive</i>

43:46.023 --> 43:48.401
<i>There's nothing we can't do</i>

43:48.792 --> 43:51.170
<i>Together me and you</i>

43:51.462 --> 43:53.499
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

43:53.931 --> 43:56.207
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

43:56.433 --> 43:58.811
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

43:58.902 --> 44:01.178
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

44:01.338 --> 44:03.716
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

44:15.986 --> 44:18.091
One hour!
One hour to show time!

44:29.066 --> 44:30.374
Ugh.

44:30.434 --> 44:33.677
I presume you have finished
writing your speech?

44:34.038 --> 44:35.984
Ah, my dog ate it?

44:36.306 --> 44:37.683
Ugh.

44:37.941 --> 44:41.354
You can just stay in your room
all night and write that speech!

44:42.246 --> 44:43.350
Huh?

44:44.648 --> 44:45.991
Hey!

44:47.751 --> 44:48.923
Let me out!

44:49.319 --> 44:51.925
Not until you've learned
some manners, young lady!

44:52.156 --> 44:53.999
No, no,
you don't understand!

44:54.091 --> 44:56.264
I've got to get
to the concert!

44:56.326 --> 44:58.203
Look, I'm not the princess!

44:58.262 --> 44:59.332
I'm Keira!

44:59.463 --> 45:01.943
It's too late for
more of your pranks.

45:10.908 --> 45:12.683
Come on, Tori!

45:13.243 --> 45:17.055
<i>Hey, it's Tori! I'm out princessing
right now, so just leave a message!</i>

45:18.215 --> 45:22.322
Tori, it's Keira. There's kind of
a situation and we need to talk.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.491
Call me when
you get this!

45:33.130 --> 45:34.700
Ten minutes to curtain!

45:35.899 --> 45:38.345
And Limburger is here to supervise
the broadcast personally.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.403
You have been warned.

45:39.470 --> 45:40.471
Who?

45:40.537 --> 45:42.608
Hilarious. Nine minutes.

45:43.373 --> 45:45.046
Oh, uh, thanks!

45:46.844 --> 45:49.188
Where is she, Riff?
Something's wrong.

45:50.681 --> 45:51.682
And where's my phone?

45:53.550 --> 45:55.393
I can't do this.

46:00.624 --> 46:03.161
Come on, Tori.

46:13.170 --> 46:14.774
Keira.

46:14.838 --> 46:18.376
Tough tacos. She's not
my problem anymore.

46:20.577 --> 46:21.954
Let's sit
right in front!

46:22.012 --> 46:23.923
Maybe Keira
will see us!

46:41.799 --> 46:45.872
<i>Hey, it's Tori! I'm out princessing
right now, so just leave a message!</i>

46:48.138 --> 46:49.674
My limo?

46:53.710 --> 46:55.348
Not now, Vanessa.

46:56.647 --> 46:58.684
What are they doing here?

47:00.017 --> 47:01.621
Crider!

47:02.553 --> 47:04.794
Crider! Crider!

47:09.560 --> 47:10.561
Oh!

47:10.761 --> 47:13.674
Quiet, Vanessa, please
I'm trying to think.

47:14.398 --> 47:17.106
There's just gotta be
a way out of here.

47:20.771 --> 47:22.580
Yeah, yeah,
I know, that's me.

47:22.639 --> 47:24.778
And not even
my best picture.

47:27.744 --> 47:30.020
We won't be
a minute, Captain.

47:30.080 --> 47:33.152
The Duchess sent me back
to fetch her spectacles.

47:33.217 --> 47:34.719
You know how she is.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.059
I thought we were here
for the diam...

47:36.653 --> 47:37.688
Ow!

47:39.756 --> 47:41.429
Yes, Mr. Crider.

47:43.827 --> 47:44.897
Ooh!

47:47.130 --> 47:49.633
Keira! Keira, where are you?

47:49.700 --> 47:51.304
Keira, you're on
in 30 seconds!

47:52.369 --> 47:53.712
Oh, no!

47:57.374 --> 48:00.719
That's funny. This
always works in movies.

48:05.682 --> 48:07.423
We're getting close, Rupert.

48:07.985 --> 48:10.431
Look for a panel
with a gardenia.

48:10.787 --> 48:11.959
Ha!

48:12.022 --> 48:15.196
Now that's a gardenia
if ever I saw one.

48:15.759 --> 48:18.137
Now we just have to figure
out how to open it.

48:18.195 --> 48:20.436
Go do it Rupert.
Be snappy!

48:20.497 --> 48:21.874
Right-o, Mr. Crider.

48:28.672 --> 48:30.583
Put some muscle
into it!

48:32.075 --> 48:33.748
Doh! Pity that.

48:35.212 --> 48:37.818
Go find something
we can open it with!

48:38.215 --> 48:39.592
All right.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.134
Keira! You're on!

48:56.199 --> 48:57.576
No, no,
you don't understand!

48:57.634 --> 49:01.377
I can't! Not today,
maybe tomorrow.

49:01.438 --> 49:04.976
What? These people have been
waiting hours to see you!

49:05.042 --> 49:07.852
It's your responsibility
to give them a show!

49:09.112 --> 49:12.150
Where is she? Tell her to get
her behind on stage. Now!

49:40.444 --> 49:44.722
Ah! Rupert! There's got to be
a way to get this door open.

49:45.882 --> 49:47.259
Oh!

49:54.291 --> 49:55.929
Good job, Rupert!

50:09.473 --> 50:13.444
Keira, please stop being such
a princess and get out there!

50:13.510 --> 50:15.217
Limburger's having a fit.

50:15.278 --> 50:17.758
That guy can
destroy your career!

50:19.049 --> 50:20.722
Keira's career.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.460
Vanessa, shh!

50:30.360 --> 50:32.567
Keira! Keira!

50:34.231 --> 50:35.335
Okay.

50:40.237 --> 50:41.648
Come on!

50:52.082 --> 50:53.459
Whoa!

50:53.683 --> 50:55.356
Ka-ching!

52:21.571 --> 52:22.811
Ah...

52:40.223 --> 52:41.964
What are you doing?

52:51.768 --> 52:52.940
<i>Sorry.</i>

52:56.006 --> 52:57.007
Ahem.

53:02.579 --> 53:05.185
<i>When I was young</i>

53:10.086 --> 53:12.532
<i>I played for fun</i>

53:14.491 --> 53:16.801
<i>Made up the words</i>

53:19.296 --> 53:21.276
<i>Nobody heard</i>

53:24.000 --> 53:26.310
<i>But now I see</i>

53:29.973 --> 53:32.249
<i>All eyes on me</i>

53:33.243 --> 53:35.519
<i>And suddenly</i>

53:36.580 --> 53:39.060
<i>I'm in a dream</i>

53:39.683 --> 53:42.721
<i>I've got a feeling now</i>

53:44.154 --> 53:49.263
<i>Everything's right somehow</i>

53:49.459 --> 53:52.668
<i>Here I am
Being who I want</i>

53:53.163 --> 53:57.543
<i>Giving what I've got
Never a doubt now</i>

53:57.601 --> 54:01.208
<i>Here I go
Burning like a spark</i>

54:01.271 --> 54:05.083
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

54:07.677 --> 54:11.056
<i>I'm stepping up
Right to the top</i>

54:11.414 --> 54:14.952
<i>That's how I'm wired
I take it higher</i>

54:15.018 --> 54:18.932
<i>I'm in control
I broke the mold</i>

54:18.989 --> 54:22.596
<i>The girl you see
is up to me</i>

54:23.526 --> 54:26.302
<i>I'm lifting off the ground</i>

54:27.230 --> 54:31.679
<i>Finding the perfect sound</i>

54:31.968 --> 54:35.472
<i>Here I am
Being who I want</i>

54:35.538 --> 54:39.486
<i>Giving what I've got
Never a doubt now</i>

54:39.542 --> 54:43.046
<i>Here I go
Burning like a spark</i>

54:43.113 --> 54:46.583
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

54:46.650 --> 54:48.459
<i>Again</i>

54:48.518 --> 54:50.555
<i>Again</i>

54:50.620 --> 54:54.033
<i>Again and again and again</i>

54:54.624 --> 54:56.467
That's right.
Do it your way.

54:57.994 --> 55:00.634
Vanessa! What has
gotten into you?

55:04.134 --> 55:07.980
All right! Vanessa,
why didn't you tell me?

55:09.406 --> 55:12.216
<i>There's a star
that's right inside you</i>

55:12.776 --> 55:15.450
<i>So come on and let it out</i>

55:16.846 --> 55:20.055
<i>Find out what you're about
and just shout</i>

55:20.116 --> 55:22.426
<i>Here I am!</i>

55:22.752 --> 55:26.461
<i>Being who I want
Giving what I've got</i>

55:26.523 --> 55:28.560
<i>Never a doubt now</i>

55:28.625 --> 55:32.163
<i>Here I go
Burning like a spark</i>

55:32.228 --> 55:34.435
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

55:34.497 --> 55:37.535
<i>Here I am
Being who I want</i>

55:37.600 --> 55:41.844
<i>Giving what I've got
Never a doubt now</i>

55:41.905 --> 55:45.375
<i>Here I go
Burning like a spark</i>

55:45.442 --> 55:48.321
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

55:48.378 --> 55:52.986
What did I tell you?
Now that's why she's a star!

55:53.049 --> 55:55.029
<i>Never a doubt now</i>

55:55.085 --> 55:58.726
<i>Here I go
Burning like a spark</i>

55:58.788 --> 56:02.361
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

56:02.425 --> 56:03.768
<i>Again</i>

56:04.027 --> 56:05.973
<i>Again</i>

56:06.029 --> 56:11.911
<i>Again and again and again
and again and again</i>

56:19.509 --> 56:21.580
<i>Hello, Meribellal</i>

56:26.516 --> 56:27.961
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

56:31.187 --> 56:34.430
<i>I never dreamed
I'd be up here...</i>

56:35.959 --> 56:39.406
<i>Be up here in such
a fantastic kingdom!</i>

56:42.332 --> 56:46.474
<i>You have the coolest
princesses in the universe!</i>

56:49.305 --> 56:53.720
<i>In fact, Princess Tori in
particular is really awesome.</i>

56:53.777 --> 56:56.155
<i>And often misunderstood.</i>

56:56.212 --> 56:57.589
<i>Mostly by her Aunt.</i>

56:59.215 --> 57:01.661
<i>But Tori still loves her.</i>

57:02.619 --> 57:04.565
One, two, three, four!

57:04.621 --> 57:09.229
<i>Sun's up
a little after 12:00</i>

57:09.292 --> 57:12.501
<i>Make breakfast for myself</i>

57:12.562 --> 57:15.236
Leave the work
for someone else

57:15.298 --> 57:16.777
Where is she?

57:21.004 --> 57:23.450
Come to Papa!

57:30.480 --> 57:33.723
Shoo! Rupert!
Do something!

57:35.418 --> 57:38.831
Got it covered! Brought some
bug spray just in case!

57:42.091 --> 57:44.469
That's not bug spray!
It's hair spray!

57:45.495 --> 57:49.102
And strawberry-scented.
I hate strawberries!

58:03.146 --> 58:04.921
Oh, anyway,
it did the job.

58:04.981 --> 58:08.360
And I might add, your hair
does look touchably soft.

58:10.220 --> 58:12.393
Never mind!
Grab the plant!

58:18.461 --> 58:19.997
How deep does this thing go?

58:21.631 --> 58:22.803
Time to cut the roots.

58:38.314 --> 58:42.126
<i>Oh, princesses wanna have fun</i>

58:56.866 --> 58:58.971
The gardenia!

58:59.636 --> 59:02.139
<i>And now,
a brief intermission!</i>

59:03.540 --> 59:05.520
<i>Sing amongst yourselves!</i>

59:12.882 --> 59:14.657
What?
What's she doing?

59:14.717 --> 59:17.095
Go to commercial!

59:22.825 --> 59:24.463
Now, to the boat!

59:34.771 --> 59:35.909
That'll work.

59:37.607 --> 59:39.951
Sergeant! To the castle!
Right away!

59:40.009 --> 59:43.422
I'm sorry, miss, but this carriage
is for the Royal Family only.

59:43.479 --> 59:45.390
Oh. Of course. Hang on.

59:49.886 --> 59:52.366
There. Now, to the castle,
double time!

59:52.422 --> 59:54.493
I'd better check
with His Majesty.

59:54.557 --> 59:57.504
I'm His Majesty!
Her Majesty!

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.564
Your... Ugh! Never mind,
I'll drive it myself!

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:11.074
Wait!

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.915
I was hoping
to run into you.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.583
Yesterday was so much fun.

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:19.953
Uh-huh, that's nice. Hyah!

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.355
Whoa!

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.996
Are... Are we rushing
anywhere in particular?

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:30.367
Or just trying to make me...

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:31.632
lose my lunch?

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:34.470
I've got to rescue
a magical diamond plant!

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:38.239
Okay, fine,
forget I asked.

01:00:57.553 --> 01:00:58.725
Hyah!

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:08.938
Excuse me, but I think
that belongs to my kingdom!

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:12.841
Going somewhere?

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.573
Hey! Now she's over there!

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:20.179
There's princesses
everywhere! Hold me!

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.915
Um, which one
of you do I like?

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.465
Uh...

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:41.666
Her.

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:45.277
Now why don't you hand
over that plant, Seymour?

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:46.907
Keira?

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.648
Seymour?

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.514
Don't call me that!

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.758
Oh!

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.297
Hyah!

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.269
Smart thinkin',
Mr. Crider!

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.871
You'll be comin' back
for me, right?

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:34.517
Handsome Prince Liam saves
the damsels in distress.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.190
Hey! Where'd the damsels go?

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:08.124
So long, suckers!
Gotta fly!

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:23.433
You see, ladies, the trick is to
always come prepared for anything!

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:28.747
And it helps to have
just the right outfit!

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.680
The man's right.

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:35.052
What always cheers me up
is a new dress!

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:38.888
Oh! How about a chic hairdo
to complete the ensemble?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.024
What?

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:52.929
No!

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:57.801
Oh, no!

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:04.982
I hate my life.

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.251
It's dead.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.081
Can't you plant
another one?

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:13.787
How? Where do you get seeds
for a magical plant?

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.161
Unless...

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:19.728
I wonder if its diamonds
could be its seeds!

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.200
Hey, yeah!

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:23.259
The friendship necklaces!

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:50.597
It's no use!

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.103
The concert!

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:22.486
Hey, look!

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.520
Whoa!

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.058
Oh!

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:41.705
Excuse me!
Pardon me! Coming through!

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.471
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:54.912
<i>Hey, Meribella!</i>

01:06:58.647 --> 01:07:01.787
<i>I'd like to dedicate this next
song to my two new sisters,</i>

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:04.764
<i>Princesses Trevi
and Meredith.</i>

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:09.734
<i>They taught me
that the secret</i>

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.534
<i>to writing new songs
is a good pillow fight.</i>

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:20.678
<i>And to my new best friend, Her
Royal Highness, Princess Tori!</i>

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:33.488
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:55.278
<i>Hey, Meribella!</i>

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.954
<i>I found myself today</i>

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:09.257
<i>And now I'm glad to say</i>

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:12.162
<i>I'm living life
straight from the heart</i>

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:16.099
<i>Oh, what a gift to see</i>

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.365
<i>I'm lucky to be me</i>

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:21.670
<i>And now I just
can't wait to start</i>

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:24.573
<i>I keep on rising up</i>

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.805
<i>No coming down</i>

01:08:26.868 --> 01:08:30.214
<i>So hang on for the ride</i>

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.274
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.651
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.951
<i>It's a beautiful view</i>

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:39.049
<i>From up here in the sky</i>

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.185
<i>There's nothing we can't do</i>

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.662
<i>Together me and you</i>

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:46.962
<i>Look how high we can fly</i>

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:50.731
<i>Oh, oh
Look how high we can fly</i>

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:01.475
<i>On this perfect day</i>

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.538
<i>Nothing standing in my way</i>

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:05.916
<i>On this perfect day</i>

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.046
<i>When nothing can go wrong</i>

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:10.488
<i>It's the perfect day</i>

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:12.890
<i>Tomorrow's gonna come too soon</i>

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:17.055
<i>I could stay
Forever as I am</i>

01:09:17.118 --> 01:09:22.796
<i>On this perfect day</i>

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:24.394
<i>It's the perfect day</i>

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.670
And besides updating Meribella's irrigation
systems against future droughts,

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:33.544
we are also establishing a social
services program for our kingdom's needy.

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:36.674
From now on, I,
Princess Victoria,

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:41.210
intend to use my voice to help those
who feel they don't have a voice,

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:44.189
to make Meribella
a better place to live.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.885
Thank you.

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:52.261
<i> Meribella!</i>

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.261
<i>Put your hands up for me!</i>

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.502
<i>Come on!</i>

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.642
<i>Here we are</i>

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:04.335
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.380
<i>Here we are</i>

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.346
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:09.974
<i>Here we are</i>

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.212
<i>Being who we want
Be who we want</i>

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.981
<i>Giving what we got
Give what we got</i>

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.284
<i>Never a doubt now
Never a doubt now</i>

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:17.847
<i>Here we go</i>

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:19.893
<i>Burning like a spark
Burn like a spark</i>

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.826
<i>Light up the dark
Here we go</i>

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.488
<i>Here we are</i>

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.532
<i>Being who we want
Be who we want</i>

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:27.465
<i>Giving what we got
Give what we got</i>

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:29.799
<i>Never a doubt now
Never a doubt now</i>

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.337
<i>Here we go</i>

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:33.134
<i>Burning like a spark
Burn like a spark</i>

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:36.540
<i>Light up the dark again</i>

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.545
<i>Again</i>

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.706
<i>Again</i>

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:43.340
<i>Again and again and again</i>

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:46.249
<i>Again and again
Again</i>

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.310
<i>Again</i>

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:51.824
<i>Again and again
and again and again</i>

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.757
<i>Here we go!</i>
