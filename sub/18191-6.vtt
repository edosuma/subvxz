00:03.104 --> 00:05.139
I JUST TOLD A ROOM
FULL OF REPORTERS

00:05.171 --> 00:07.641
THAT I HAD A BRAIN TUMOR
AND YOU'RE MAKING THIS
ABOUT YOU.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.577
WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME
I COULD BREAK THAT STORY

00:09.609 --> 00:11.044
IF YOU WERE NEVER
PLANNING TO GIVE IT TO ME?

00:11.077 --> 00:13.314
- HEY, I'M GREER.
- SHE'S GAY.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.314
Beth: IT SEEMS LIKE
SHE'S IN TO YOU.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.648
Brenna: WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.650
- I HAVE LEUKEMIA, MOM.
- WHAT?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.553
- I NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT!
- WAIT A SECOND! I'M SORRY,

00:19.586 --> 00:21.021
BUT AS YOUR MOTHER,
I CAN'T--

00:21.054 --> 00:22.422
I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

00:22.455 --> 00:23.623
WHO IS NATALIE ORTIZ?

00:23.657 --> 00:25.725
- SHE'S MY SISTER, ISN'T SHE?
- YES.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.129

NO, IT'S OKAY.
THERE'S NO RIGHT WAY

PANICKING

03:05.652 --> 03:06.787
DIDN'T HELP ANYTHING.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.290
I KNOW I HAVE
TO START TREATMENT.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.459
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
TO SEE GEORGE LATER TODAY

03:12.492 --> 03:13.727
TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.562
YOU DID. OH, APRIL--

03:15.596 --> 03:17.264
OH, THAT'S SUCH GOOD NEWS.

03:17.298 --> 03:20.433
SEE? THIS IS GONNA
BE OKAY.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.781

I DON'T KNOW.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.788

03:41.822 --> 03:44.692

OH HONEY.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.770

03:56.804 --> 03:58.739
THAT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.509
WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE THIS OUT TOGETHER.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.616
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I WENT TO SEE

04:09.650 --> 04:11.718
GEORGE WITH YOU TODAY?

04:11.752 --> 04:12.853
YEAH, SURE.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.826

04:23.663 --> 04:25.966
WELL, IT HAS TO BE EASIER
NOW THAT THE CAT'S
OUT OF THE BAG.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.701
KEEPING THAT SECRET
WAS REALLY STRESSFUL.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.737
NO, I KNOW, BUT...

04:29.769 --> 04:31.338
WATCHING THEIR REACTIONS
LAST NIGHT

04:31.372 --> 04:32.439
WAS REALLY STRESSFUL, TOO.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.673
I MEAN, IT'S ALMOST WORSE

04:33.706 --> 04:35.709
THAN FINDING OUT
I HAD CANCER.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.011
NOW I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH MY ANXIETY

04:37.043 --> 04:38.678
AND EVERYONE
ELSE'S FEELINGS.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.713
WELL, AT LEAST YOU
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT MY FEELINGS.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.783
I DON'T HAVE ANY.

04:42.816 --> 04:43.917
WHAT WOULD I DO
WITHOUT YOU?

04:45.019 --> 04:46.754
YOU'D BE AN EMPTY SHELL.

THE JOB SEARCH GOING?

04:54.360 --> 04:55.596
OH, ACTUALLY,
I HAVE NEWS.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.764
AS YOU KNOW,
IT'S MY GOAL TO FIND

04:57.798 --> 04:59.733
SOMETHING THAT I LOVE
THAT COULD BECOME A CAREER.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.735
BETH, I'M NOT LETTING YOU
BECOME A SEX WORKER.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.536
OH.
( snorts )

05:03.569 --> 05:05.372
SHUT UP.
SERIOUSLY,

05:05.406 --> 05:06.706
SEEING "PRETTY IN PINK"
WITH BRENNA

05:06.740 --> 05:08.608
TOTALLY INSPIRED ME.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.310
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
YOU KNOW, HOW SHE MADE
HER OWN CLOTHES,

05:10.343 --> 05:11.644
AND THEN IN THE END
SHE MADE HER...

05:11.678 --> 05:13.547
- THE PINK PROM DRESS.
- ...THE PINK PROM DRESS, YEAH.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.750
I MADE YOU SOMETHING.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.018
REALLY?

05:20.454 --> 05:21.689
OH!

05:21.721 --> 05:23.524

05:23.557 --> 05:24.591
JUST OPEN IT.

05:27.627 --> 05:31.064
WHA--
THIS IS... SO...

05:32.066 --> 05:34.334
- UNIQUE.
- JUST TRY IT ON.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.502
TRUST ME,
JUST TRY IT ON.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.903
- YEAH?
- YEAH!

05:45.446 --> 05:46.713
IT'S, UH...

05:46.747 --> 05:47.781
IT'S AWFUL.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.615
( laughing )
IT'S A START.

05:49.649 --> 05:52.685
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE USED
SOME KIND OF MEASURING DEVICE.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.887
( both laughing )

05:54.922 --> 05:57.557
IT WAS THE BEST BAR MITZVAH
I HAVE EVER CRASHED.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.593
LIKE, HANDS DOWN.

05:59.625 --> 06:00.894
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME
WITH ME NEXT TIME.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.529
ARE YOU GRINDING
ON THAT RABBI?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.699
HI, GUYS.
HOW'S APRIL DOING?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.802
OKAY.

06:08.836 --> 06:13.540
- WAIT, WHAT'S WRONG WITH APRIL?
- I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.007
WELL, IF YOU WANNA
TAKE YOUR MIND OFF
ALL THAT HEAVY STUFF,

06:15.041 --> 06:16.442
I'M HAVING
A PARTY TOMORROW.

06:16.476 --> 06:17.543
MY PARENTS
ARE OUT OF TOWN.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.879
LET ME GUESS--
NANTUCKET?

06:18.911 --> 06:21.749
( chuckles )
ACTUALLY, YEAH.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

06:21.781 --> 06:23.449
I HAVE SPECIAL POWERS.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.119
REALLY?
SO DO I.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.687
I CAN TELL WHEN SOMEONE'S
MAKING FUN OF ME

06:26.720 --> 06:27.987
AND THEY DON'T THINK
I REALIZE IT.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.593
ANYWAYS, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO COME TO MY PARTY, TOO.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.595
WEAR BLUE.
IT'S A THEME.

06:34.627 --> 06:35.896

FOR SAVE THE BAY.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.699
YEAH, MAYBE.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.533
- WE'LL BE THERE.
- GREAT.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.536
GOTTA GET TO CLASS.
SEE YOU.

06:45.505 --> 06:46.606
REALLY?
YOU WANNA GO?

06:46.639 --> 06:48.475
YEAH, WHO TURNS DOWN
A PARTY

06:48.509 --> 06:50.177
IN A FREAKING CASTLE?

06:50.409 --> 06:51.677
UNLESS YOU HAVE PLANS
WITH YOUR LOVER.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.947
NO, I THINK KIERAN'S
WORKING TOMORROW.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.783
THEN IT'S ON.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.584
YOU THINK SHE HAS
A MOAT AROUND HER HOUSE?

06:57.617 --> 06:58.718

06:59.620 --> 07:01.822

07:04.824 --> 07:06.726

07:07.795 --> 07:09.696
Woman:
YESTERDAY HE TOLD ME

07:09.730 --> 07:11.831
THAT HE COULDN'T
HANDLE IT.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.033
HE SAID THAT
HE LOVED ME TOO MUCH

07:13.065 --> 07:14.535
TO WATCH ME DIE.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.036
HE ACTUALLY USED
THOSE WORDS.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.605
I KNOW THAT HE'S BEEN
SEEING THAT GIRL AGAIN.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.540
I CAN SMELL HER TACKY PERFUME

07:20.574 --> 07:22.175
ON HIS CLOTHES, SO...

07:22.209 --> 07:24.610
I PUNCHED HIM
IN THE FACE.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.012
( laughter )

07:26.045 --> 07:27.613
I THINK
I BROKE HIS NOSE.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.115
( laughter )

07:29.149 --> 07:32.151
MEG, I DON'T NORMALLY
CONDONE VIOLENCE,

07:32.185 --> 07:34.153
BUT THAT GUY'S A DOUCHE BAG
AND YOU'RE AWESOME.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.191
( light applause )

07:42.228 --> 07:43.663
WELL...

07:43.697 --> 07:46.567
UM, I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT I HAVE A.M.L.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.571
I HAVE TO START
TREATMENT SOON.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.906
AND I KNOW THIS IS
SUCH A TRIVIAL THING
TO WORRY ABOUT,

07:52.939 --> 07:57.677
BUT I'M TERRIFIED
OF LOSING MY HAIR.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.781
AND JUST FEELING... UGLY...

08:01.814 --> 08:04.685
AND WEAK. I CAN'T EVEN
CLIMB THE STAIRS ANYMORE

08:04.718 --> 08:06.687
WITHOUT GETTING WINDED.
IT'S--

08:06.720 --> 08:10.557
IT'S LIKE EVERY DAY
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH LOSING

08:10.591 --> 08:12.658
SOMETHING ELSE.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.494
THE LATEST IS MY APPETITE.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.264
I TAKE A COUPLE OF BITES
AND THAT'S IT.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.499
BUT, I MEAN,
I LOVE FOOD THOUGH.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.600
I REALLY ALWAYS HAVE.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.872
AND NOW NOT BEING ABLE
TO FIND PLEASURE

08:25.906 --> 08:28.108
IN SOMETHING THAT I'VE
ALWAYS LOVED SO MUCH

08:28.141 --> 08:31.612
IS JUST REALLY... SAD.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.216
IT'S LIKE...

08:36.250 --> 08:40.586
EVERYTHING THAT MAKES
MY LIFE FULL...

08:40.620 --> 08:42.288
IS STARTING
TO SLIP AWAY.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.259
Meg:
SO YOU'RE STARTING
TO CATCH ON

08:45.292 --> 08:47.059
TO HOW MUCH FUN THIS IS.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.528
( laughter )

08:57.270 --> 08:59.038
George: OKAY,
SO AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE,

08:59.072 --> 09:01.107
I'M NOT GONNA BE
HANDLING YOUR TREATMENT.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.243
I'M REFERRING YOU
TO DR. SUSAN HAMBURG,

09:03.277 --> 09:05.745
WHO IS A FRIEND.
SHE'S ALSO ONE OF THE TOP

09:05.778 --> 09:07.280
A.M.L. SPECIALISTS IN BOSTON.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.585
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE BEST CARE AVAILABLE.

09:11.618 --> 09:14.321
SO THIS IS WHAT WILL
MOST LIKELY HAPPEN FIRST:

09:14.553 --> 09:16.289
DR. HAMBURG WILL REVIEW

09:16.322 --> 09:18.292
ALL YOUR TEST RESULTS,
AND THEN SHE'LL PREP YOU

09:18.325 --> 09:20.826
FOR CHEMO, WHICH WILL BE
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.029
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GO OVER

09:23.062 --> 09:24.764
THE SPECIFICS
ON THAT RIGHT NOW?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.633
- YES.
- NO.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.134
WELL, HONEY,
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE BLINDSIDED.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.870
YOU NEED TIME
TO PROCESS EVERYTHING.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.105
I HAVEN'T DONE
EXTENSIVE RESEARCH
ON PURPOSE.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.740
I'D RATHER LEARN DETAILS
AS THEY COME UP,

09:34.774 --> 09:36.275
OTHERWISE I'M GONNA
DRIVE MYSELF CRAZY,

09:36.309 --> 09:38.879
OBSESSING ABOUT
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
DOWN THE LINE.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.746
- THAT'S REASONABLE.
- Sara: GEORGE...

09:40.780 --> 09:42.282
AND SHE IS THE PATIENT.

09:42.316 --> 09:43.817
GEORGE, PLEASE.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.351
MOM, DON'T YOU CARE
WHAT I WANT?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.753
OF COURSE,
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

09:46.787 --> 09:48.721
HAVING THE INFORMATION
UP FRONT JUST MAKES SENSE?

09:48.754 --> 09:51.258
- ( sighs )
- George: APRIL.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.061
- FINE.
- George: OKAY.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.761
YOU'LL BE GETTING
YOUR FIRST ROUND

09:55.796 --> 09:58.164
OF CHEMOTHERAPY,
WHICH IS CALLED
INDUCTION THERAPY.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.267
AND DR. HAMBURG
WILL THEN DETERMINE

10:00.299 --> 10:01.835
WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS,

10:01.868 --> 10:04.870
DEPENDING ON HOW
THE CANCER RESPONDS
TO THE CHEMO.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.273
AND WHAT ABOUT
CONSOLIDATION?

10:06.306 --> 10:08.642
I READ THAT THAT INVOLVES
A STEM CELL TRANSPLANT?

10:08.674 --> 10:09.842
HERE, WAIT A SECOND,
I HAVE--

10:09.875 --> 10:11.244
BUT THAT'S DOWN THE LINE.
BUT-- NO, NO.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.046
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED
THE INTERNET NOW.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.214
I'M RIGHT HERE, SARA.

10:14.246 --> 10:15.716
I KNOW, IT'S JUST--
HERE, HANG ON.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.250
I'VE GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.019
OH, AND THERE WERE SOME
EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS

10:19.052 --> 10:20.953
- THAT I THINK ARE--
- MOM, PLEASE.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.188
I JUST HAVE
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

10:22.221 --> 10:23.255
BUT I DON'T.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.658
AND I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SICK.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.259
I'M DOING THIS
FOR YOU.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.061
I JUST-- I HAVE
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.665
ARE YOU COMING?

10:32.698 --> 10:34.201
I'M NOT DONE
TALKING TO GEORGE.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.668
FINE, I'LL SEE
YOU AT HOME.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.303
- THANKS, GEORGE.
- SURE.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.072
( sighs )

10:40.106 --> 10:42.375
ALL RIGHT.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.144
WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS
OF CHEMO?

10:44.177 --> 10:45.812
I MEAN, I KNOW APRIL
DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR THIS,

10:45.846 --> 10:46.947
BUT I DO.
I'M GONNA BE THE ONE

10:46.980 --> 10:48.148
TAKING CARE OF HER.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.282
WELL, UH...

10:49.316 --> 10:52.284
NAUSEA,
MOUTH SORES, RASHES,

10:52.318 --> 10:54.421
INCREASED RISK
OF INFECTION AND FEVER.

10:54.653 --> 10:57.090
AND THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
OF CHANGES TO HER FERTILITY.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.258
WAIT, WHAT?

10:58.290 --> 11:00.027
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

11:00.059 --> 11:01.961
WELL, SHE MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE
AFTER CHEMO.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.163
I'LL LET HER KNOW.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.664
NO, PLEASE DON'T.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.234
THE LAST THING SHE NEEDS
IS ANOTHER EXCUSE

11:07.267 --> 11:08.268
TO POSTPONE TREATMENT.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.769
SARA, PLEASE.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.004
IT'S UNETHICAL
OF ME TO WITHHOLD

11:11.038 --> 11:12.239
MEDICAL INFORMATION
WHICH COULD IMPACT

11:12.272 --> 11:13.240
HER FUTURE.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.307
I'M WELL AWARE
OF THE ETHICS, GEORGE,

11:15.341 --> 11:17.110
BUT I NEED HER
TO HAVE A FUTURE.

11:18.711 --> 11:19.812
RIGHT, YOU CAN'T
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND,

11:19.846 --> 11:21.114
BECAUSE YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN A PARENT.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.750
YOU MADE OTHER CHOICES,
AS WE BOTH KNOW.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.120
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
MY POSITION HERE.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.288
THEN LET ME TALK
TO HER ABOUT IT.

11:35.761 --> 11:39.932
♪ SUNLIGHT,
WAKE ME UP... ♪

11:39.966 --> 11:41.301
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA CALL ME

11:41.334 --> 11:42.769
AFTER BETH DROPPED YOU OFF.

11:42.802 --> 11:43.803
YEAH, SORRY.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.304
WHEN I GOT HOME,
THINGS WERE

11:45.337 --> 11:46.972
KIND OF GOING DOWN.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.241
MY MOM FOUND OUT
ABOUT APRIL.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.376
GOD, I'M SORRY.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.080
YOU SHOULD HAVE
CALLED ME.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.148
I CAN'T FIND
MY PUNCH CARD.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.216
OH NO,
THAT'S OKAY.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.817
YOU'RE IN HERE A LOT.
I RECOGNIZE YOU.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.388
HERE, NOW YOU'RE
ONLY THREE COFFEES

12:01.421 --> 12:03.289
AWAY FROM A FREE ONE.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.759
SWEET.
THANK YOU.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.730
GOD, THAT GUY
WAS SO CREEPY.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.033
REALLY? HE WAS
JUST BEING NICE.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.033
YEAH, I GUESS...

12:14.067 --> 12:15.469
IN A CREEPY WAY.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.138
WAIT, ARE YOU JEALOUS?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.841
YOU ARE!

12:21.875 --> 12:23.243
FINE, MAYBE JUST
A LITTLE.

12:23.275 --> 12:25.278
I'M USUALLY ABOVE
ALL THAT, BUT--

12:25.312 --> 12:26.346
I DON'T KNOW--
YOU BRING IT OUT IN ME.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.315
JUST DON'T MAKE ME
GET YOUR NAME

12:28.347 --> 12:30.116
TATTOOED ON MY BODY.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.451
HOW ABOUT REALLY SMALL,
ON YOUR LOWER BACK
OR SOMETHING?

12:32.485 --> 12:34.086
- NO.
- NOT EVEN IN LATIN?

12:35.121 --> 12:36.322
WHAT IS KIERAN IN LATIN?

12:36.355 --> 12:38.191
KIERAN.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.427
( snorts )

12:41.461 --> 12:45.966
♪ AND LEAD ME INTO--
LEAD ME INTO LOVE. ♪

12:45.999 --> 12:47.868
3:00, LATEST.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.135
HEY, PAUL.
I WAS JUST WONDERING

12:49.168 --> 12:50.169
IF YOU HAD ANY
OPEN ASSIGNMENTS

12:50.202 --> 12:51.270
FOR YOUR "WHAT THE HECK"
COLUMN?

12:51.303 --> 12:53.273
I'M SURE I DO.
THAT'D BE VERY HELPFUL.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.875
LET ME THINK...

12:54.908 --> 12:57.244
I GOT A GUY WHO'S SUING
THE DONUT PLACE
IN SOUTH STATION.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.812
WANTS THE COMPANY
TO ADMIT YOU CAN, IN FACT,

12:59.846 --> 13:01.447
BECOME ADDICTED
TO DONUT HOLES.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.216
I GOT A CALL
FROM A MAN IN CONCORD,

13:03.250 --> 13:06.385
WHO CLAIMS HE GOT RABIES
FROM HIS PET TURTLE.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.554
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S
A PRACTICAL JOKE.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.158
OH! SPEAKING OF RABIES,
A RABID SOX FAN

13:11.191 --> 13:14.094
SUPER GLUED HIS BUTT
TO HIS SEAT AT FENWAY.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.461
FIRE DEPARTMENT'S
THERE NOW.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.365
AT LEAST THAT'S
BREAKING NEWS, I'M IN.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.866
THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT
ANGLES YOU COULD TAKE
WITH THE STORY,

13:20.900 --> 13:23.802
BUT MAKE SURE TO APPROACH
IT FROM BEHIND.
( laughs )

13:23.836 --> 13:25.304
APRIL, NOT SURE WHO
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH...

13:25.337 --> 13:27.374
- EXCUSE ME?
- ...BUT APPARENTLY,
YOU HAVE BEEN

13:27.407 --> 13:29.375
PERSONALLY REQUESTED
BY THE HENDRIE CAMPAIGN

13:29.408 --> 13:30.442
FOR A ONE-ON-ONE.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.279
"PERSONALLY REQUESTED"?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.980
I JUST GOT A CALL.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.317
BRUCE AND HIS FAMILY
ARE SHOOTING A CAMPAIGN AD

13:37.350 --> 13:38.918
AND YOU WILL BE
SHADOWING THEM ON SET.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.053
WELL, I'LL BE THERE.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.088
AND I WILL BE
AT A LUNCHEON AT THE RITZ.

13:43.123 --> 13:46.192
AMERICAN BUSINESSWOMAN'S
ASSOCIATION ELIZABETH WARREN

13:46.225 --> 13:48.195
IS SPEAKING, SO IT'S NOT
LIKE I COULD HAVE GONE

13:48.227 --> 13:49.296
TO THIS HENDRIE THING ANYWAY.

13:50.897 --> 13:51.565
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU WEREN'T THE ONE

13:51.597 --> 13:53.165
THEY PERSONALLY REQUESTED.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.269
April:
YOU STILL WON'T TELL ME?

13:57.303 --> 13:58.370
Dominic:
YOU'LL SEE WHEN
WE GET THERE.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.873
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED
A SURPRISE.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.908
BUT IT'S THE PERFECT
WAY TO CELEBRATE.

14:02.942 --> 14:03.909
NOT TOO SHABBY--

14:03.943 --> 14:06.312
ONE-ON-ONE
WITH BRUCE HENDRIE.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.014
I KNOW, CAN YOU
BELIEVE IT?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.316
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.217
I DON'T KNOW,
RAQUEL JUST TOLD ME

14:11.250 --> 14:12.619
THEY PERSONALLY
REQUESTED ME.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.054
THAT MUST HAVE
KILLED HER.

14:15.087 --> 14:16.322
WHO DO YOU THINK
REQUESTED YOU?

14:16.355 --> 14:17.856
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE PERSON

14:17.890 --> 14:19.525
IN THE HENDRIE CAMP
WHO OWES ME.

14:19.558 --> 14:20.860
LEO?

14:20.894 --> 14:22.128
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
HE HAD A CONSCIENCE.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.563
WOW, MAYBE HE'S NOT
AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.566
- THIS IS IT?
- MM-HMM.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.500
AMAZING RIGHT?
IT'S A FOOD CRAWL.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.638
A LOT OF THE RESTAURANTS
FROM THAT "BEST OF BOSTON"
LIST ARE PARTICIPATING.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.907

14:40.879 --> 14:43.917
WOW, THIS IS--
THIS IS GREAT.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.086
THANK YOU.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.659
( vomiting )

14:57.330 --> 14:59.432
( flushes )

15:26.692 --> 15:28.495
HEY, GRAHAM.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.431
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR SECRET'S OUT.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.133
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:33.165 --> 15:34.933
I'M A LIGHT SLEEPER,

15:34.967 --> 15:36.568
AND I'M VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THOSE SOUNDS.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.938
MY SISTER HAD ALL KINDS
OF BODY IMAGE STUFF
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

15:39.972 --> 15:44.043
I WASN'T PURGING.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.513
SO, ARE YOU JUST--

15:48.514 --> 15:50.115
OH.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.719
( whispers )
IS DOMINIC THE FATHER?

15:52.951 --> 15:56.255
WHAT? NO. GRAHAM,
I AM NOT PREGNANT.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.457
WELL, IF YOU ARE,
JUST LET ME KNOW ASAP, OKAY?

15:58.490 --> 16:00.592
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE
GONNA TURN MY BEDROOM
INTO A NURSERY

16:00.626 --> 16:01.695
- THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND...
- GOOD NIGHT.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.462
...A NEW PLACE,
WHICH TAKES FOREVER.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.398
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
WANT TO END UP ON SOME
RANDOM DUDE'S COUCH.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.732
THIS IS ALSO
ABOUT ME, YOU KNOW!

16:22.682 --> 16:24.049
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:24.083 --> 16:26.019
JUST THE WOMAN
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.187
I KNOW WHAT
THIS LOOKS LIKE--

16:27.220 --> 16:28.455
A SEANCE?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.591
NO, IT'S A MEDITATION CIRCLE.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.625
GEORGE SAID YOU SHOULD
TRY TO REDUCE YOUR STRESS

16:33.659 --> 16:35.028
BEFORE YOU START CHEMO.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.363
- SO I--
- WHEN DID GEORGE SAY THAT?

16:36.395 --> 16:38.597
AFTER YOU LEFT
THE APPOINTMENT.

16:38.630 --> 16:40.600
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW
ANY MORE DETAILS, BUT--

16:40.633 --> 16:43.602
WELL, I MEAN, IF YOU ALREADY
KNOW THEM, JUST TELL ME.

16:43.635 --> 16:45.471
MAYBE I DON'T WANT
TO BE BLINDSIDED.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.107
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.709
ANYTHING MAJOR?

16:49.743 --> 16:52.544
NO. JUST THAT YOU
NEED TO LEARN

16:52.578 --> 16:55.414
HOW TO CALM
YOUR ANXIETY, SO...

16:55.447 --> 16:56.415
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I NEED--

16:56.448 --> 16:57.750
COME ON, APE.
IT'LL BE FUN.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.652
WE'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH
OUR FUNDAMENTAL SELVES.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.554
IF I'M DOING IT,
SO ARE YOU.

17:02.589 --> 17:03.623
SIT UP.

17:07.460 --> 17:11.029
Woman on CD:
Welcome to the beginning
of a life-changing journey.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.532
First, find
a comfortable position.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.434
Ideally, sitting up.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.403
Rest your hands
gently in your lap

17:17.436 --> 17:18.771
or on your legs,

17:18.805 --> 17:21.473
then close your eyes.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.243
We're going to begin
by focusing on the breath.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.613
Take deep breaths,
in through your nose,

17:26.645 --> 17:28.681
out through your mouth.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.682
Do this five times.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.354
Your breath should sound
like a soft, gentle wind.

17:34.386 --> 17:37.457
Now, try to clear
your mind completely.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.063
I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.566
APRIL, NO.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.233
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S HARD.
A LOT OF MY PATIENTS MEDITATE.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.802
AND IT DOES
TAKE PRACTICE,

17:49.836 --> 17:51.270
BUT IT REALLY WORKS
FOR THEM.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.272
PLEASE, JUST--
HOW ABOUT YOU TRY FIVE MINUTES?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.375
I WISH I COULD, MOM.
BUT I HAVE A JOB.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.143
AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS JUST FIVE MINUTES

17:57.176 --> 17:58.711
FOR ME ANYMORE.
EVERY MINUTE COUNTS.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.616
THAT DID NOT SOUND
LIKE A SOFT, GENTLE WIND.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.796
( panting )

18:30.742 --> 18:32.412
I'M BRUCE HENDRIE,

18:32.444 --> 18:34.413
AND I WANT TO BE
YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR.

18:34.447 --> 18:38.351
I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE
HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE,

18:38.384 --> 18:41.788
AND MORE ACCESSIBLE
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE
OF MASSACHUSETTS.

18:41.820 --> 18:46.792
AFTER ALL, I HAVE
A VERY PERSONAL INVESTMENT
IN THIS ISSUE.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.728
- I WANT YOU--
- HEY, GUYS.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.896
I'M THE SICK KID
WITH THE BRAIN TUMOR.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.266
I'M AVAILABLE
FOR WEDDINGS
AND PARTIES.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.603
WHEN I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED,
MY FATHER HERE

18:56.635 --> 18:58.403
WAS ON A GOLFING TRIP.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.905
AND HE STAYED AND PLAYED
GOLF ANOTHER THREE DAYS

19:00.138 --> 19:02.509
- BEFORE COMING HOME.
- CUT, LET'S TAKE LUNCH.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.444
- ( bell rings )
- WHAT IS THIS, LEON?

19:05.478 --> 19:06.846
WHAT? YOU TOLD ME
TO BE MYSELF.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.580
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS STAND THERE.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.450
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A LINE.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.720
I WANT PEOPLE
TO KNOW THAT I HAVE

19:13.752 --> 19:16.556
A VERY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE HEALTH CARE ISSUES.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.825
YOU PAID FOR
MY TREATMENTS
IN CASH.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.226
NO NO NO.
HANG ON, SORRY.

19:20.259 --> 19:21.728
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE REFORM

19:21.760 --> 19:23.695
BEFORE YOUR STAFF
PREPPED YOU THIS MORNING?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.664
BECAUSE I THINK
I OVERHEARD YOU
ASKING SOMEONE

19:25.698 --> 19:28.701
WHAT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MEDICARE
AND MEDICAID WAS--

19:28.734 --> 19:30.470
- AND IT'S NOT JUST
THE LETTERS, BY THE WAY.
- ( sighs )

FROM THE "POST."

19:51.290 --> 19:52.724
IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.693
LIKEWISE.
HOW ABOUT I GIVE
YOU AN INTERVIEW

19:54.727 --> 19:55.961
AFTER YOU EAT?

19:56.194 --> 19:58.565
I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY,
SO WE COULD START NOW.

- NOTHING.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.855
IS IT 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T
DEFINED THIS?

20:22.888 --> 20:24.390
I'M NOT USUALLY
INTO LABELS,

20:24.423 --> 20:25.557
BUT I'D GO THERE FOR YOU.

20:27.759 --> 20:30.395
BOYFRIEND, GIRLFRIEND--

20:30.430 --> 20:32.932
SHOULD WE MAKE IT OFFICIAL?

20:35.768 --> 20:37.436
OR-- OR NOT?

20:37.470 --> 20:39.972
I DON'T THINK THAT
I'M READY FOR THAT YET.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.875
I'M JUST ALL OVER
THE PLACE RIGHT NOW,

20:42.909 --> 20:44.943
AND THERE'S SO MUCH
GOING ON WITH APRIL.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.883
I KNOW-- I KNOW THAT
YOU MUST BE SCARED
TO LOSE HER,

20:50.916 --> 20:54.252
BUT THERE'S THIS SOCRATES
QUOTE THAT I ALWAYS REMEMBER

20:54.287 --> 20:55.822
WHEN I THINK ABOUT LOSS.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.690
"TO FEAR DEATH

20:57.723 --> 21:00.425
IS NOTHING OTHER THAN
TO THINK ONESELF WISE

21:02.662 --> 21:04.463
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT HELPS,

21:04.497 --> 21:06.398
BUT IT MADE ME
SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

21:09.701 --> 21:10.970
SO YOU DON'T SEE YOUR
INVESTMENT IN ANZA ENERGY

21:11.003 --> 21:12.704
- AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST?
- NOT AT ALL.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.641
I WAS NEVER EMPLOYED THERE.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.776
I DO HAVE A FINANCIAL
INTEREST IN IT, SO--

21:16.808 --> 21:18.711
THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION.
IS THERE A REASON

21:18.744 --> 21:20.747
YOU HAVEN'T REVEALED EXACTLY
HOW MUCH THAT STAKE IS?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.949

IS PRIVATE.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.417

21:26.952 --> 21:30.355
IF YOU'RE ELECTED,
SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED

21:30.390 --> 21:32.791
ABOUT YOUR POTENTIAL ROLE IN
THE STATE UTILITIES COMMISSION.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.926
MR. HENDRIE HAS
TO GET BACK TO THE SHOOT.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.763

21:38.798 --> 21:41.768
AND AS A PROFESSIONAL,
CAN WE ASSUME

21:41.800 --> 21:44.737
YOU'LL USE ONLY THE MATERIAL
YOU RECEIVED ON THE RECORD?

21:44.770 --> 21:47.573
I'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS
THAT WITH MY EDITOR.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.817
I SAY USE ALL OF IT.

TO KEEP IT DOWN.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.762
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT REQUESTED ME,
WEREN'T YOU?

22:10.797 --> 22:14.333

22:16.001 --> 22:17.502

22:17.537 --> 22:18.538

22:18.570 --> 22:19.739
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:19.771 --> 22:20.839
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.974
IF YOU REALLY NEED
LEO HENDRIE IN YOUR AD,

22:23.009 --> 22:25.912
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO CREATE HIM WITH C.G.I.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.414

22:40.759 --> 22:42.595
WHY'D YOU EVEN SHOW UP,
ANYWAY?

22:42.627 --> 22:44.864
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
IN A TV COMMERCIAL.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.133
NOW I CAN CROSS IT OFF
MY BUCKET LIST.

22:47.365 --> 22:50.103
OKAY, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE
A REAL CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

22:50.135 --> 22:53.705
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE AN ADULT

22:53.740 --> 22:55.607
AND HAVE YOUR PARENTS
TREAT YOU LIKE A CHILD?

22:55.641 --> 22:57.743
PLEASE, YOU ARE A CHILD,

22:57.777 --> 22:59.412

22:59.444 --> 23:00.712

23:00.747 --> 23:02.682
WHEN I LIVED IN PARIS,

23:02.714 --> 23:04.650
I DIDN'T TAKE A DIME
FROM MY PARENTS.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.451
I PAID MY OWN BILLS,

23:06.486 --> 23:07.920
I LIVED IN
A CRAPPY APARTMENT,

23:07.953 --> 23:10.990
I WORKED AT A CRAPPY JOB
AT A BAKERY AND I LOVED IT.

23:11.022 --> 23:13.692
I WENT ON THE ROOF OF
MY BUILDING EVERY NIGHT,

23:13.726 --> 23:14.926
AND I WOULD LOOK OUT
AT THE CITY

23:14.961 --> 23:16.762
AND THINK ABOUT
ALL THE THINGS

23:16.796 --> 23:18.765
I WAS GONNA DO
WITH MY LIFE.

23:18.798 --> 23:22.000
AND THEN I GOT SICK,
I HAD TO MOVE BACK HOME

23:22.034 --> 23:25.137
AND... IT'S ALL GONE NOW.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.673
MY PARENTS DON'T EVEN HAVE
A ROOF YOU CAN STAND ON.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.778
I GET IT.

23:32.811 --> 23:34.614
I LIVE AT HOME, TOO,

23:34.646 --> 23:37.549
AND MY MOM HAS STARTED
MICROMANAGING MY LIFE.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.720
I FEEL LIKE I'M SUFFOCATING.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.555
WELL, AT LEAST SHE'S TRYING.

23:42.587 --> 23:47.527
MY PARENTS JUST
USE ME AS A PROP
IN THEIR LIVES.

23:47.559 --> 23:50.028
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT
TO MY KIDS.

23:50.061 --> 23:53.633
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I WON'T BE HAVING ANY,

23:53.665 --> 23:55.701

WON'T EITHER.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.538

I DO NOT.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.494
- Dispatcher: 11-41, copy.
- DO WE HAVE A NAME ON THIS ONE?

31:03.528 --> 31:06.097
- Cop: ATTLEBORO
E.M.T.'S TWO MINUTES OUT.
- WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

31:06.131 --> 31:07.232
APRIL CARVER.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.375
- ( phones ring )
- ( chattering )

31:26.285 --> 31:28.186
DID YOU GET IN TROUBLE?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.922
HOW ARE YOU?

31:29.954 --> 31:33.259
I REPEAT:
DID YOU GET IN TROUBLE?

31:33.291 --> 31:35.560
NO, YOUR SEIZURE
WAS PRETTY CONVENIENT.

31:35.594 --> 31:39.230
SEE?
SILVER LINING.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.299
CANCER CAN GET YOU OUT
OF ALL SORTS OF SITUATIONS.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.068
BEING THE SON OF BRUCE HENDRIE
DIDN'T HURT EITHER.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.372
NAH, I THINK IT
WAS THE SEIZURE.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.909
- COME HERE.
- WHAT?

31:50.942 --> 31:52.211
COME HERE. I WANT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.945
COME HERE.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.251
YOU'LL COME AROUND
EVENTUALLY.

32:02.186 --> 32:05.223
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.160
CAN YOU LEAVE US
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

32:08.192 --> 32:09.327
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO THE PATIENT.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.195
OH, NO NO NO.
SHE CAN STAY.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.698
FINE.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.434
THE SEIZURE WAS
DEFINITELY CAUSED BY...

32:16.468 --> 32:18.671
THE TUMOR PRESSING AGAINST
MY BRAIN STEM, GOT IT.

32:18.703 --> 32:21.205
THE M.R.I. RESULTS SHOW

32:21.240 --> 32:24.209
THAT THE PRIMARY TUMOR
UNFORTUNATELY HAS GROWN,

32:24.242 --> 32:25.376
- WHICH MEANS--
- MAYBE I'VE GOT

32:25.411 --> 32:27.346
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS
TO LIVE IF I'M LUCKY.

32:29.580 --> 32:32.084
OLD NEWS.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.288
I'M SO SORRY.

32:43.194 --> 32:46.097
- S-- SO YOU'RE...
- TERMINAL.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.467
YUP.

32:53.471 --> 32:56.407
- ( music plays )
- ( people chatter )

33:07.219 --> 33:08.686
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.356
SAME HERE. HEY.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.994
SO HOW'S APRIL DOING?

33:17.028 --> 33:18.130
NOT GREAT.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.766
IT'S SCARY.

33:23.634 --> 33:27.573
EVERYONE'S ALWAYS
ASKING ME IF I'M OKAY,

33:27.605 --> 33:29.240
AND I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE TO SAY "YES"

33:29.273 --> 33:31.309
OR ELSE THEY'RE GONNA MAKE
ME KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT...

33:31.343 --> 33:34.512
AND I DON'T WANT TO.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.615
OH, I'M SORRY
I BROUGHT IT UP.

33:36.647 --> 33:38.549
NO, IT'S OKAY.

33:38.584 --> 33:39.751
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.589
I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA
THINK THIS SOUNDS STUPID,

33:44.623 --> 33:47.492
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE
LIFE ENDS WHEN YOU DIE.

33:47.526 --> 33:51.163
LAST YEAR I WAS WITH
MY GRANDMOTHER WHEN SHE DIED.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.163
REALLY?

33:52.197 --> 33:53.598
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

33:53.632 --> 33:56.667
I THOUGHT IT WAS
GONNA BE AWFUL--

33:56.701 --> 33:59.605
AND SOMETIMES IT WAS--

33:59.637 --> 34:03.442
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY
REALLY INSPIRING.

34:03.474 --> 34:06.377
SHE WAS COMPLETELY LUCID

34:06.412 --> 34:09.347
AND SAID SHE FELT THIS
WARMTH SURROUNDING HER,

34:09.380 --> 34:12.784
LIKE SHE KNEW SHE WAS
GONNA BE TAKEN SOMEWHERE
BEAUTIFUL.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.219
WOW.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.623
AND THEN SHE TOLD ME
SHE LOVED ME

34:17.655 --> 34:21.059
AND CLOSED HER EYES.

34:21.092 --> 34:23.695
ANYWAY, AFTER THAT,
I DID A LOT OF READING,

34:23.728 --> 34:26.664
AND THE STORIES ARE
LIKE MIND-BLOWING.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.168
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
STUFF WASN'T TRUE,

34:29.201 --> 34:31.402
LIKE THE WHITE LIGHT
PEOPLE SEE

34:31.436 --> 34:33.304
IS REALLY ELECTRICITY
FROM THE BRAIN.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.606
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF THERE'S A HEAVEN...

34:37.342 --> 34:39.510
BUT I KNOW APRIL'S
GOING TO BE OKAY,

34:39.545 --> 34:41.480
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

34:41.512 --> 34:43.748
THANK YOU.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.684
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
ANYONE'S SAID

34:46.717 --> 34:48.586
THAT'S ACTUALLY
MADE ME FEEL BETTER.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.597
SO I KNOW THIS IS
KIND OF COMING OUT
OF NOWHERE,

34:58.630 --> 35:01.800
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT--

35:01.833 --> 35:04.202
WAIT.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.103
IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND?

35:08.340 --> 35:10.608
I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS COMING.

35:10.641 --> 35:12.543
I'M SORRY.

35:12.577 --> 35:14.278
I'LL FIND YOU LATER.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.567
( phone beeps )

35:41.572 --> 35:42.641
( sighs )

35:46.445 --> 35:48.679
- MS. CARVER.
- UH, APRIL, PLEASE.

35:48.713 --> 35:51.382
APRIL, I WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME

35:51.416 --> 35:53.184
AND FOR HELPING MY SON.

35:53.217 --> 35:54.552
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL.

35:54.585 --> 35:56.487
I DIDN'T REALLY
DO ANYTHING.

35:56.521 --> 35:57.688
WE DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT THE DETAILS.

35:57.722 --> 35:59.557
WE'RE JUST GLAD
THAT HE'S HERE NOW

35:59.590 --> 36:03.228
- AND HE'S ALL RIGHT.
- DESPITE WHAT IT MAY
LOOK LIKE,

36:03.262 --> 36:06.465
I DO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
POLITICS AND FAMILY.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.467
I LOVE LEO,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.835
AND WE ONLY JUST LEARNED
THAT HE WAS TERMINAL.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.672
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING
MY SON,

36:13.704 --> 36:16.541
MY ONLY CHILD...
( chokes up )

36:18.876 --> 36:21.512
IS UNBEARABLE.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.300
WHERE'S LEO?

36:41.333 --> 36:43.335
I'LL CALL SECURITY.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.882
LEO.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.253
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:04.356 --> 37:05.891
YOU HEARD THE NEWS.

37:05.923 --> 37:08.693
I'VE GOT MAYBE THREE
OR FOUR MONTHS LEFT,

37:08.726 --> 37:10.628
SO I FIGURE WHY NOT
SPEED UP THE PROCESS?

37:10.661 --> 37:14.967
I MEAN, TODAY IS
AS GOOD A DAY AS ANY.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.336
WHAT HAPPENED TO LIVING
EACH DAY TO THE FULLEST?

37:18.369 --> 37:20.438
SCREW THAT.

37:22.239 --> 37:24.443
THIS'LL MAKE A BETTER
HEADLINE FOR THE "POST."

37:24.476 --> 37:26.811
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- NO!

37:30.882 --> 37:32.451
OH! YOU ARE SUCH AN ASS!

37:32.483 --> 37:34.952
DID YOU REALLY THINK
I WAS GONNA KILL MYSELF?

37:34.987 --> 37:37.722
ESPECIALLY BY
JUMPING OFF A BUILDING?

37:37.755 --> 37:38.923
I MEAN, HOW CLICHE
WOULD THAT BE?

37:38.956 --> 37:40.958
GOD! DO YOU TAKE
ANYTHING SERIOUSLY?!

37:40.992 --> 37:42.693
WHY SHOULD I?
I'M GONNA DIE.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.664
WHAT'S THE POINT IN
WORRYING ABOUT ANYTHING?

37:45.697 --> 37:47.666
IT'S LIBERATING, REALLY.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.867
I DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT

37:48.900 --> 37:50.869
WHAT MY LIFE IS GONNA
BE LIKE DOWN THE LINE.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.038
THERE IS NO
"DOWN THE LINE" FOR ME.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.905
THERE ISN'T GONNA
BE A STATION WAGON.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.907
THERE AREN'T GONNA
BE ANY KIDS.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.045
WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE
IS NOT LIVING.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.516
TODAY... WE LIVED.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.952
THIS-- THIS RIGHT HERE.

38:06.985 --> 38:07.985
THIS IS LIVING.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.655
PRETENDING
TO DIE IS LIVING?

38:09.688 --> 38:10.989
ABSOLUTELY, YES. WHAT?

38:11.023 --> 38:12.824
DO YOU REALLY THINK

38:12.858 --> 38:14.559
YOU'RE LIVING YOUR LIFE
TO THE FULLEST

38:14.592 --> 38:16.994
BY SITTING BEHIND
A DESK EVERY DAY?

38:17.028 --> 38:18.429
DON'T YOU WANT
TO HAVE ADVENTURES

38:18.463 --> 38:20.831
LIKE WE HAD TODAY
ALL THE TIME?

38:20.865 --> 38:23.068
OR DO YOU--

38:23.300 --> 38:25.536
DO YOU WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF THE TIME

38:25.570 --> 38:28.507
YOU HAVE LEFT
ANSWERING TO OTHER PEOPLE?

38:32.610 --> 38:34.679
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:34.713 --> 38:36.748
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU TEXTED ME.

38:36.782 --> 38:39.016
THIS GIRL IS INTO FISH.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.018
I DON'T THINK THAT
WE SHOULD BE IN GREER'S ROOM.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.688
IT'S A PARTY
AND THE DOOR'S OPEN.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.956
- COME HERE.
- I DON'T KNOW.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.927
I DON'T BITE,
UNLESS YOU LIKE THAT.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.472
( footsteps approach )

39:00.505 --> 39:01.840
GREER.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.545
SORRY, WE WERE
JUST TAKING A NAP.

39:06.577 --> 39:08.447
JUST LEAVE...

39:08.480 --> 39:09.547
BOTH OF YOU.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.048
Ford:
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

39:11.449 --> 39:12.650
Greer:
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?!

39:12.684 --> 39:13.684
TAKE THAT OFF!

39:13.719 --> 39:15.786
OH, YOU WOULD LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU--

39:15.820 --> 39:16.887
OH GOD.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.657
WHERE'S THE BIDET?

39:24.628 --> 39:26.630
( rock music playing )

39:35.474 --> 39:37.541
( keys jingle )

39:37.576 --> 39:40.644
HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

39:40.679 --> 39:41.713
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU.

39:41.746 --> 39:43.581
WORKING.
LONG DAY.

39:43.614 --> 39:45.382
AND STARVING.

39:45.416 --> 39:48.085
MOM, WHERE ARE
THE FROZEN WAFFLES?

39:48.119 --> 39:49.554
THEY'RE IN THE TRASH.

39:49.588 --> 39:52.389
THEY'RE FULL OF
HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP

39:52.423 --> 39:53.724
AND THINGS
I CAN'T EVEN PRONOUNCE.

39:53.759 --> 39:56.695
THIS IS NOW AN ORGANIC,
WHOLE FOOD HOUSEHOLD.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.396
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

39:58.429 --> 39:59.898
I'M HUNGRY FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN DAYS,

39:59.931 --> 40:01.967
AND ALL I WANT RIGHT NOW
IS A WAFFLE.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.534
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:03.568 --> 40:05.637
WHY ARE YOU-- HAVE YOU
NOT BEEN EATING, APRIL?

40:05.670 --> 40:09.574
SERIOUSLY,
MOM, I'M FINE.

40:09.608 --> 40:12.077
- APRIL.
- STOP IT.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.981
WHAT IS THIS?!

40:17.014 --> 40:20.485
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY CURTAINS?

40:20.518 --> 40:21.719
WHERE'S MY RUG?

40:21.753 --> 40:23.454
THEY WERE FULL
OF DUST MITES.

40:23.487 --> 40:24.889
YOU NEED
A STERILE ENVIRONMENT

40:24.922 --> 40:26.791
SO YOU DON'T CATCH
ANYTHING BEFORE CHEMO.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.193
AND WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MY MATTRESS?

40:28.425 --> 40:30.561
IT'S TEMPORARY, UNTIL I
CAN BUY AN ORGANIC ONE.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.463
AND GET THE RIGHT
ANTI-BACTERIAL--

40:32.496 --> 40:33.898
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?

40:33.931 --> 40:36.168
THIS IS MY ONLY
PERSONAL SPACE

40:36.201 --> 40:37.469
IN THIS ENTIRE HOUSE.

40:37.501 --> 40:38.936
IT'S LIKE NOTHING
IS MINE ANYMORE

40:38.969 --> 40:41.005
EVER SINCE YOU FOUND OUT
I WAS SICK.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.041
YOU HIJACKED
MY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT,

40:43.074 --> 40:44.909
YOU INVADE MY PRIVACY

40:44.943 --> 40:47.112
AND COVER EVERYTHING
IN PLASTIC.

40:47.144 --> 40:48.746
YOU JUST DECIDE
WHAT I GET TO EAT?

40:48.780 --> 40:50.949
HONEY, IT'S A MOTHER'S JOB
TO PROTECT HER CHILD,

40:50.981 --> 40:52.016
WHETHER YOU
LIKE IT OR NOT.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.619
WELL, SPEAKING
OF BEING A PARENT,

40:54.652 --> 40:57.956
I'M MAKING AN APPOINTMENT
TO SEE A FERTILITY DOCTOR.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.791
- WHAT?
- I FOUND OUT

40:59.824 --> 41:01.126
THAT THE CHEMO COULD
MAKE ME INFERTILE

41:01.159 --> 41:02.126
AND I DON'T WANT THAT.

41:02.159 --> 41:04.461
I CANNOT BELIEVE GEORGE.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.463
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:05.496 --> 41:07.231
I--

41:08.199 --> 41:09.800
HE TOLD YOU THAT?!

41:09.835 --> 41:11.536
WHY WOULDN'T HE TELL ME?

41:15.773 --> 41:16.974
I TOLD HIM NOT TO.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.677
WHA-- HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

41:19.710 --> 41:21.112
YOUR LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT

41:21.146 --> 41:22.646
THAN YOU HAVING
BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.548
THAT IS NOT
YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE!

41:24.583 --> 41:26.050
IT'S MY BODY!

41:26.083 --> 41:27.885
AND IF I WANT
TO HAVE A BABY--

41:27.918 --> 41:29.887
APRIL, YOU ARE MY BABY!

41:29.920 --> 41:32.190
- DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND--
- OH GOD! MOM!

41:32.224 --> 41:34.492
I AM SORRY,
BUT I AM AN ADULT!

41:34.525 --> 41:38.762
THE ONLY WAY I AM
GONNA GET THROUGH THIS

41:38.797 --> 41:41.699
IS I HAVE SOME HOPE

41:41.733 --> 41:44.268
OF HAVING
A NORMAL LIFE ONE DAY.

41:46.271 --> 41:50.275
I'M GOING TO SEE
A FERTILITY DOCTOR.

41:50.507 --> 41:52.143
YOU'RE SCHEDULED
TO START CHEMO--

41:52.177 --> 41:53.744
WELL, WE'LL RESCHEDULE IT,

41:53.777 --> 41:56.248
BECAUSE I AM
DOING THIS FIRST!
