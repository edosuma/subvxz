00:16.099 --> 00:17.892
[narrator] <i>The battle for Anaxes!</i>

00:17.976 --> 00:20.729
<i>One of the Republic's largest shipyards</i>
<i>is under attack</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:23.231
<i>from Admiral Trench's Separatist Forces.</i>

00:23.314 --> 00:26.234
<i>Jedi Generals Mace Windu</i>
<i>and Anakin Skywalker</i>

00:26.317 --> 00:29.612
<i>lead a two-pronged assault</i>
<i>on the ground and in the air.</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:32.574
<i>But after weeks of heated battle</i>
<i>and mounting losses,</i>

00:32.657 --> 00:36.494
<i>the Republic's grip on Anaxes</i>
<i>begins to slip away.</i>

00:46.755 --> 00:49.341
The droids have overrun
our main production facility.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.760
It won't be long before
the Separatists take Anaxes,

00:51.843 --> 00:54.137
compromising our entire reserve fleet.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.931
Pardon the interruption, General,

00:57.015 --> 01:01.061
but Rex here has a good theory
on why we keep, uh... losing.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.146
Please, Captain.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.608
The droid army uses analytics
to predict our strategy.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.402
The first time we use a tactic,
it's very effective.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.321
The next, less so.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.448
In fact, the more we use a certain tactic,

01:13.865 --> 01:15.825
the less effective it becomes.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.496
They learn our tendencies
and use that data against us.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.955
To counter them,

01:21.039 --> 01:24.542
we're constantly working out ways
to vary our attack.

01:25.001 --> 01:29.255
But the losses we are experiencing
on Anaxes are not commonplace.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.465
Exactly.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.926
The counterattacks are so specific,

01:33.009 --> 01:36.513
it's my strategy the droids know,
my playbook.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.724
My concern is that Rex is one of our best.

01:39.808 --> 01:43.937
If the droids can learn to defeat him,
we may all be vulnerable.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.480
What do you propose?

01:46.272 --> 01:49.401
Let Rex and me take a small squad
behind enemy lines.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.361
There's a Separatist Cyber Center

01:51.444 --> 01:54.948
which relays all battlefield intel
to their command ship.

01:55.031 --> 01:57.867
If we're going to find anything,
it will be there.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.955
If you think it will help
turn this fight around, get going.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.623
Thank you, General.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.627
Rex, is there anything else?

02:09.546 --> 02:10.672
No, General.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.160
[door closes]

02:40.243 --> 02:42.287
Come on, Rex. Time to move out.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.291
[Rex] Fives, Echo,

02:46.374 --> 02:47.792
and before that, Hevy.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.587
There's so many troopers gone.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.591
Yeah, regular folk don't understand.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.053
Sometimes in war,
it's hard to be the one that survives.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.638
That's what I'm worried about.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.182
Well, what do you mean?

03:03.558 --> 03:04.934
I didn't tell the Generals.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.437
They might think I'm crazy.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.065
In fact, you might think I'm crazy.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.816
What is it?

03:12.317 --> 03:14.027
I think Echo's alive.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.989
That's not possible.
He died at the Citadel.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.450
The way the droids are countering us here,

03:20.533 --> 03:21.910
the strategies I'm using,

03:21.993 --> 03:25.580
they're all old battle plans
Echo and I drew up together.

03:25.914 --> 03:30.001
Look, Rex, I hear what you're saying.
But it's just not possible.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.128
I hope you're right.

03:32.545 --> 03:36.925
But the fact is, Echo's fingerprints
are all over these Separatist strategies.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.093
Rex.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.721
You have to admit what you're saying
is a long shot at best,

03:41.805 --> 03:44.391
and most likely, misplaced hope.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.601
I need you to be focused on this.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.478
I-I know, I know.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.562
Don't worry.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.610
So, what squad are we taking in?

03:57.696 --> 03:59.406
Clone Force 99.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.831
[Jesse]
I've heard mixed things about these guys.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.833
[Kix] They have a 100% success rate.

04:11.251 --> 04:15.380
[Jesse] It's not that they win,
it's how they win that worries me.

04:15.463 --> 04:19.676
[clone on PA] <i>Repeat, coming in hot</i>
<i>on platform TT-3-9-7.</i>

04:23.013 --> 04:24.305
-<i>Clear the airfield!</i>
-[clones shouting]

04:24.806 --> 04:26.016
<i>Clear the airfield!</i>

04:34.399 --> 04:36.192
So why haven't I heard of this squad?

04:36.860 --> 04:39.654
Experimental unit Clone Force 99,

04:39.738 --> 04:43.616
they're defective clones with,
uh... desirable mutations.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.911
99, hey? Nice touch.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.123
They call themselves "The Bad Batch."

04:57.255 --> 04:58.798
[knuckles cracking]

05:08.975 --> 05:11.311
The cavalry has arrived!

05:21.946 --> 05:25.158
These guys are clones?
They don't look like clones to me.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.954
Sergeant, good to see you again.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.165
-You too, sir.
-This is Hunter.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.709
Sorry we're late, Commander.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.003
We were putting down an insurrection
on Yalbec Prime

05:37.087 --> 05:38.421
when your comm came in.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.050
Had a few unforeseen... complications.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.136
[chuckles] Ever fought a male Yalbec?

05:45.512 --> 05:48.723
Um, no. Can't say I have.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.225
You're lucky.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.143
Only way to kill 'em is with one of these.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.271
[Hunter] That's right.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.942
Wrecker here cut off the Queen's stinger
while she was still alive.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.529
That's why all those Yalbec males
tried to eat us.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.948
Uh, technically,
they were trying to mate with us.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.866
And, for your information,

06:06.950 --> 06:10.787
the stinger of a Yalbec Queen
is a delicacy on some planets.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.664
They call him Tech.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.876
Yeah, he can fill your head
with useless info for hours.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.839
Crosshair, on the other hand,
he's not much of a conversationalist,

06:20.922 --> 06:24.092
but when you have to hit
a precise target from ten klicks,

06:24.175 --> 06:25.719
Crosshair's your man.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.387
So, Commander,

06:27.846 --> 06:30.849
what kind of "suicide mission"
do you have for us this time?

06:30.932 --> 06:33.226
Let's get going.
We'll brief you on the way.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.539
What are you looking at?

06:55.206 --> 06:58.209
We don't usually work with "regs."

06:58.752 --> 06:59.836
"Regs?"

07:00.337 --> 07:03.214
He's talking about regular clones.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.050
But don't take it personal.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.178
We're all on the same team,
so cut the attitude and listen up.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.765
Here's the mission.
Our target is this Cyber Center.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.018
It's the "brains" of the entire
Separatist campaign here on Anaxes.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.813
I could demolish that with one hand! Yeah!

07:19.147 --> 07:20.774
This isn't a demo job, Wrecker.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.234
It's strictly a retrieval operation.

07:28.907 --> 07:32.660
Sector One, alert.
Enemy gunship approaching your location.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.245
Come in, Sector One.

07:34.913 --> 07:35.955
Roger, roger.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.585
Fire!

07:44.589 --> 07:45.674
Incoming fire!

07:57.936 --> 08:01.815
We're going down! [laughing]

08:16.955 --> 08:19.165
[Tech coughs, groans]

08:19.249 --> 08:20.667
[Wrecker groans]

08:20.750 --> 08:22.335
[coughs]

08:22.419 --> 08:25.505
We always get shot down
when we travel with regs.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.048
[Kix] Cody! Help!

08:29.092 --> 08:31.302
He's trapped! We have to do something.

08:31.803 --> 08:32.804
I'll get him.

08:32.887 --> 08:37.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, Captain. Wrecker, get him out.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.269
Get back!

08:41.730 --> 08:43.064
This is ridiculous!

08:43.148 --> 08:45.066
He's gonna need help
to get Cody out of there.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.401
[chuckles]

08:46.484 --> 08:49.904
He's gonna get the gunship out of there.
Not Cody.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.827
[grunting]

09:06.004 --> 09:07.005
Boom.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.137
[Cody groans]

09:15.263 --> 09:16.473
[groans]

09:16.556 --> 09:18.266
-[laser hums]
-[groans]

09:18.350 --> 09:19.893
He has internal damage.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.520
I can cut the pain.
But he needs help fast.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.981
We all need help.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.654
That blast gave away our position.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.450
I thought getting shot down
gave away our position.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.910
Everyone, find cover.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.454
We'll hold this position
and let them come to us.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.832
I don't think so, Captain.
That's not our style.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.459
We prefer going to them.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.545
Bad Batch! Plan 82, "Shockwave!"

09:55.845 --> 09:57.722
Let's get to work.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.435
Blast them!

10:19.119 --> 10:21.246
45. Mark 151.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.164
45. Mark 151.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.426
75. Mark 357.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.011
75. Mark 357.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.763
What the--

10:43.893 --> 10:45.562
Spider droids. Fan out!

11:06.166 --> 11:08.668
Any more? Come on!

11:19.763 --> 11:22.640
That was some show you put on just now.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.727
-Just doing our job, Captain.
-[Wrecker laughs]

11:25.810 --> 11:28.980
Hey, look, Crosshair,
this little clanker likes you.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.690
-[laughs]
-[scoffs]

11:30.774 --> 11:32.108
Grow up, Wrecker.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.903
We should move out
before reinforcements arrive.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.780
Our position has been compromised.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.470
We wanted to speak to you directly, sir.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.723
This infiltration is irregular.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.308
[clicks]

12:05.392 --> 12:08.853
<i>Were there Jedi with this squad?</i>

12:09.521 --> 12:10.814
Just clones.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.275
But using tactics
like we have never seen before.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.904
<i>Interesting.</i> [clicks]

12:18.988 --> 12:21.866
<i>They're on foot now,</i>
<i>in the middle of nowhere.</i>

12:22.325 --> 12:25.495
<i>Sweep the area, locate these clones,</i>

12:25.578 --> 12:29.749
<i>and notify me if the incursion escalates.</i>

12:29.833 --> 12:31.710
[clicks]

12:44.347 --> 12:47.100
[distant growling]

12:48.810 --> 12:50.228
[sniffs]

12:51.354 --> 12:53.189
[sighs]

12:53.732 --> 12:56.943
So, I get what makes
the other Batchers unique,

12:57.277 --> 12:58.945
but what's so special about Hunter?

12:59.696 --> 13:01.448
He can put up with the other three.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.867
He was engineered with heightened senses.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.618
A place like the Cyber Center,

13:05.702 --> 13:08.329
Hunter can feel
the electromagnetic frequencies

13:08.413 --> 13:09.956
from anywhere on the planet.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.668
And here I thought we were smart
just using a holomap.

13:13.752 --> 13:17.422
Well, maps can be wrong. Hunter never is.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.803
[Cody grunting]

13:27.807 --> 13:29.934
-Hang in there, Cody.
-[groans]

13:32.020 --> 13:34.272
Listen up. We have to move out.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.068
Commander Cody's in no position to move.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.694
Already called in Evac.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.821
Kix will stay with Cody until it arrives.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.198
I'm in charge now.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.242
And I've got a plan
to get into that Cyber Center.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.662
If your plans are so good,

13:49.746 --> 13:52.749
why did Commander Cody have to call us in?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.793
You can't talk to Captain Rex like that!

13:54.876 --> 13:56.002
Says who?

13:56.586 --> 13:57.587
Whoa!

13:58.463 --> 13:59.673
Put him down!

14:00.131 --> 14:00.965
[chuckles]

14:01.049 --> 14:02.592
-Stay out of it.
-Hey! Watch it!

14:03.301 --> 14:04.761
Uh, guys, come on.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.098
Wrecker, drop him. Now.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.016
Aw.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.727
Fellas, come on!

14:13.144 --> 14:15.730
We're all fighting
for the same thing, right?

14:16.940 --> 14:17.941
[grunts]

14:18.692 --> 14:19.693
[sighs]

14:19.776 --> 14:20.777
All right then.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.155
Let's cut the chatter
and finish what we started.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.909
We'll do it your way, Captain.
For Commander Cody.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.246
Okay. Let's gear up and move out.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.626
[birds chirping]

14:46.302 --> 14:47.929
Not our primary target.

14:48.471 --> 14:51.057
It's an outpost. Should we take it?

14:51.474 --> 14:54.144
Probably easier than going around.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.854
All right, what are your orders?

14:56.312 --> 14:58.481
We pick them off from the tree line
one-by-one?

14:58.565 --> 15:02.652
Actually, I was thinking
we'd take a page from your book.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.237
Rush them head-on.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.782
[chuckles] I like your style.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.870
Clones! Get them!

15:32.474 --> 15:34.351
Hey! You're not authorized--

15:49.574 --> 15:50.992
Is it over already?

15:51.368 --> 15:52.911
Aw, man!

15:53.453 --> 15:55.914
Not bad. For a reg.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.462
All right, there it is. The Cyber Center.

16:03.004 --> 16:07.300
It looks like the Cyber Center itself
has minimal guards, about 30 droids.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.427
Wait. Wait!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.638
I got a massive signal coming in.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.683
A whole platoon of droids
is headed this way.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.602
Someone's noticed our handiwork
back at the crash site.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.145
Yeah.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.023
Make sure you keep an eye
on those incoming Separatist forces.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.359
I want to know
when they reach this outpost.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.736
-You got it, Cap.
-We've gotta move swiftly.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.614
We'll grab some speeder bikes
and flank them from the back.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.885
Do you know what's going on?

16:51.386 --> 16:53.221
Maybe it's another drill.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.685
Is everyone in position?

17:01.229 --> 17:02.230
Affirmative.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.691
Affirmative.

17:06.776 --> 17:10.196
Cap, you wanted to know when those
Separatist forces breached the outpost.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.116
Well, they're getting there
just about now.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.296
Sir, we tracked
the Clone Strike team here,

17:26.379 --> 17:29.466
they seem to have captured
this location and deserted it.

17:29.758 --> 17:32.469
I cannot calculate the logic
of this assault.

17:32.927 --> 17:37.974
[clicks] <i>There is no tactical advantage</i>
<i>to taking the outpost.</i>

17:38.058 --> 17:41.603
<i>Their target will be</i>
<i>the nearby Cyber Center.</i>

17:42.145 --> 17:44.689
<i>They must know about the algorithm.</i>

17:45.315 --> 17:49.194
<i>Get me in contact</i>
<i>with the Cyber Center at once!</i>

17:51.196 --> 17:53.531
<i>Put all droids on alert.</i>

17:53.865 --> 17:55.408
<i>An attack is coming.</i>

17:55.992 --> 17:57.744
An attack is coming? When--

18:13.885 --> 18:15.929
[battle droid]
<i>All units to the front door!</i>

18:22.143 --> 18:25.605
Hmm. This is a delicate operation.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.608
Boom! [chuckles]

18:28.692 --> 18:29.734
You take too long.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.129
-[beeps]
-We're in.

19:02.851 --> 19:04.978
Tech, get to work on these computers.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.271
We'll go get the regs.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.071
What the-- [screams]

19:19.826 --> 19:22.245
Hey, where did you come from--

19:28.084 --> 19:29.919
What took you so long, Wrecker?

19:30.003 --> 19:33.798
Hey, this is a "delicate operation."

19:38.136 --> 19:39.220
Better get in there, Cap.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.155
Okay, I'm in.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.449
-What am I looking for?
-Here's the algorithm.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.285
You're looking for a program
using this sequence.

20:02.952 --> 20:03.953
[beeps]

20:04.037 --> 20:06.039
[beeping]

20:06.122 --> 20:07.123
Found it.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.461
This is strange. It's not a program.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.881
It's a live signal from another planet--

20:15.256 --> 20:16.424
Skako Minor.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.052
A live signal?

20:25.642 --> 20:27.727
Crosshair, we're gonna need a lift.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.817
Not gonna be a problem.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.195
Here it is. This is audible.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.114
Patch me in. I want to hear it.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.703
What is that?

20:44.786 --> 20:47.872
[indistinct computerized voices]

20:47.956 --> 20:50.291
That sounds almost... almost human.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.254
It can't be.

21:02.721 --> 21:04.723
Uh-oh. [screams]

21:13.231 --> 21:14.607
We gotta go! Now!

21:27.912 --> 21:30.331
Tech, find out who's sending that signal.

21:30.749 --> 21:31.791
Ask who that is.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.838
<i>CT-1409.</i>

21:37.714 --> 21:41.509
-<i>CT-1409.</i>
-I... I don't believe it.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.386
<i>CT-1409.</i>

21:44.596 --> 21:46.806
We're gone. Rex, let's go.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.476
-<i>CT-1409.</i>
-Rex, now!

21:50.393 --> 21:53.188
<i>CT-1409.</i>

22:21.049 --> 22:23.677
We have chased the clones
out of the center, sir.

22:24.135 --> 22:27.180
They are retreating back
toward Republic lines.

22:27.263 --> 22:31.726
[clicks] <i>Did they download anything</i>
<i>from the central computer?</i>

22:32.227 --> 22:34.479
There seems to be no intel missing.

22:34.562 --> 22:38.024
But there appears to have been
a connection made with Skako Minor.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.526
<i>What?</i>

22:50.203 --> 22:52.580
That number, Cap, what did it mean?

22:53.581 --> 22:55.542
CT-1409...

22:56.084 --> 22:57.669
that was Echo's number.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.505
He's alive.
