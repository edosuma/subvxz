WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.936
- Oh. Hi, everybody.
- Morning.

00:03.938 --> 00:08.474
Morning, ALF. How are you
this fine Saturday morning?

00:08.476 --> 00:09.641
Alright.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.411
I'll be better
once I have some coffee

00:12.413 --> 00:14.580
and we talk about death.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.183
Death?

00:18.185 --> 00:21.220
I believe it was Nietzsche
who put it best

00:21.222 --> 00:24.056
"Life is short. And when it ends

00:24.058 --> 00:28.394
we crumble and stink
like an overripe blue cheese."

00:30.097 --> 00:31.730
What's he talking about?

00:31.732 --> 00:36.402
I found some pictures of you
guys taken before my arrival.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.470
Notice anything obvious?

00:39.306 --> 00:41.707
Besides being incredibly happy?

00:42.943 --> 00:46.879
Actually, what struck me
is how much you've aged.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.514
Especially you, Kate.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.585
I still have 400 years
ahead of me.

00:53.587 --> 00:57.322
What am I gonna do when you guys
move in with the dirt people?

00:58.692 --> 01:00.459
Well, we hadn't
really thought about it.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.695
Uh, I suppose
you'll move in with Lynn.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.198
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.934
This is the first
I've heard of this.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.169
B?

01:10.171 --> 01:13.472
I'm sorry, ALF,
but I just can't commit.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.475
I see.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.277
And so it starts.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.383
[theme music]

02:27.047 --> 02:30.382
I should have crashed on a
planet where people live longer.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.117
I never plan ahead.

02:32.119 --> 02:36.155
ALF, you're driving us crazy
with this death obsession.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.423
You and Woody Allen.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.592
At least it's funny
when he does it.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.795
Oh, he's just bitter
because he can't sell a sitcom.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.599
Well, whatever.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.434
Come on, everybody.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.070
We're not gonna
be home too late.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.406
Wait! Do you have to go?

02:54.408 --> 02:56.708
Well, what if something
happens to you?

02:56.710 --> 02:58.210
What will I do?

02:58.212 --> 03:01.246
ALF, for the last time,
nothing is going to happen.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.348
We're only going
to a bar mitzvah.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.484
Still, I want you
to take two cars

03:05.486 --> 03:08.420
and drive fast through
the bad neighborhoods.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.055
Kate, you take the lead car

03:10.057 --> 03:13.859
and wear something bright
to draw their fire.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.461
ALF, has anyone ever told you
when you dwell on something

03:16.463 --> 03:18.764
you become annoyingly obsessed?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.934
No, but thank you.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.703
Come on, we're
running late, hon.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.271
- Bye, ALF.
- Bye, ALF.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.873
- Bye.
- 'Bye.'

03:27.875 --> 03:31.210
Hey, whatever you do don't get
trapped between fat people

03:31.212 --> 03:32.945
and the buffet table.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.182
Oh, who am I kidding?

03:37.184 --> 03:38.984
I've gotta face facts.

03:38.986 --> 03:42.754
One day, Willie and Kate are
gonna take that six-foot dive.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.591
And then what?

03:47.194 --> 03:49.328
Oh, Lynn.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.964
Sweet, unfocused Lynn.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.634
Maybe you're my hope.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.770
[instrumental music]

04:02.076 --> 04:03.709
[mosquito buzzing]

04:07.514 --> 04:11.750
ALF, you weren't eating bugs
again, were you?

04:11.752 --> 04:15.187
I can't help it, Lynn.
I'm hungry.

04:15.189 --> 04:17.389
They were practically daring me.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.092
Oh, but I made us
some nice chicken broth.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.295
Chicken broth?

04:23.297 --> 04:25.097
What's the occasion?

04:25.099 --> 04:29.935
Well, Robert's been working
so hard lately.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.336
He looks so drawn.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.671
I thought a nice, hot meal

04:32.673 --> 04:35.641
might be just the thing
to pick his spirits up.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.576
When is your yutz
of a husband gonna

04:37.578 --> 04:39.511
shape up and do something
with his life?

04:39.513 --> 04:40.779
[Lynn sighs]

04:40.781 --> 04:43.048
You're starting to sound
like my mother.

04:43.050 --> 04:46.184
You mother, may she burn
for eternity was right.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.522
Honey, I'm home.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.029
Oh, darling.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.331
Did you get a good spot
on the boardwalk today?

04:59.333 --> 05:02.200
Yep. Right next
to the public restrooms.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.436
Well, it's about time.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.539
- How much did you make?
- Seventeen dollars.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.142
Oh, honey!

05:10.144 --> 05:11.843
Oh, I have something for you.

05:17.685 --> 05:21.119
Nice to see you haven't wasted
the last 30 years.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.655
Thank you, ALF.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.124
You know I need to hear
that from time to time.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.526
Oy.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.561
Oh, I came up
with something new today.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.897
I hope it's edible.

05:31.899 --> 05:35.334
You know the old
man-trapped-in-a-box routine?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.235
It's one of my very favorites.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.970
Well, I found a new twist on it.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.573
Something that makes it
totally unique.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.509
Man trapped in a pyramid.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.211
[laughing]

05:46.213 --> 05:47.679
Watch this.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.252
Now, here's where
it gets really difficult, see.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.488
You have to define the space
as a point.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.756
And all you have are your hands.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.759
That's what makes
this really hard.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.662
It's amazing nobody's beaten
you senseless.

06:05.199 --> 06:08.266
You still don't believe
in our dream, do you?

06:08.268 --> 06:12.137
Robert's going to be recognized
as a genius someday.

06:12.139 --> 06:15.507
And then we'll have
everything we ever wanted.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.109
Oh, of course.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.911
All you have to do is take
a drive through Beverly Hills

06:19.913 --> 06:23.181
and see the mansions
built by famous mimes.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.819
Face it. There's no payoff.

06:27.821 --> 06:28.954
Oh, yeah?

06:28.956 --> 06:33.258
Well, I have 17 big ones
that says you're wrong.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.659
[laughing]

06:34.661 --> 06:37.896
Oh, wake up and smell
the invisible flowers.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.297
Get a job.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.400
[telephone rings]

06:41.402 --> 06:42.834
You two.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.972
Hello. Yes.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.243
Well, just a moment, please.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.945
Honey, it's the circus.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.647
Oh, boy.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.048
[laughing]

06:58.519 --> 07:00.986
This is it.

07:00.988 --> 07:01.953
Hello.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.790
Yes, this is Robert Sherwood.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.926
A job?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.929
No, I'm not tied
to the mime thing.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.598
Thank you.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.567
You won't be sorry.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.235
See you Monday.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.906
What was that all about?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.274
Oh, for heaven's sake.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.842
Somebody shoot me.

07:25.746 --> 07:29.915
¶ Honey I got a job
with the circus ¶

07:29.917 --> 07:31.550
[screaming with excitement]

07:31.552 --> 07:34.619
Will you be making more
than $17 a day?

07:34.621 --> 07:37.255
Well, not at first.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.357
Good career move.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.959
And the best part is

07:40.961 --> 07:44.062
there's a place for both
of you in the act.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.164
But won't that mean
my giving up school

07:46.166 --> 07:48.767
and throwing away 30 years
of college.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.570
I was so close
to declaring a major.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.673
I hadn't thought of that,
but yes, I guess it would.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.808
Is that okay?

07:56.810 --> 07:59.144
Can I wear a funny hat?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.546
If I have anything
to say about it, pumpkin.

08:01.548 --> 08:02.681
Then let's go for it.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.715
[laughing]

08:03.717 --> 08:06.518
No! You're both insane!

08:06.520 --> 08:08.353
What about your dream?

08:08.355 --> 08:11.089
What about your space
by the men's room?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.725
Are you gonna throw
that all away?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.627
It just feels right.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.829
[both chuckle]

08:17.831 --> 08:19.164
[crowd applauding]

08:19.166 --> 08:22.667
Ladies and gentlemen!

08:22.669 --> 08:26.905
Introducing
the amazing Robertino

08:26.907 --> 08:30.141
and his incredible
target, Bobo

08:30.143 --> 08:33.245
the complaining
freak of nature.

08:33.247 --> 08:34.479
[groaning]

08:34.481 --> 08:37.482
Lynn, can't we reconsider this?

08:37.484 --> 08:41.686
I mean, shouldn't he have
at least rehearsed this thing?

08:41.688 --> 08:45.156
Well, he figured he may
only get one chance at it.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.293
[screaming]

08:50.664 --> 08:54.065
Hey! Hey, watch it.
That was too close.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.333
[screams]

08:55.335 --> 08:58.203
Hey! Couldn't I
have at least worn a cup?

09:05.846 --> 09:09.147
Well, so much for Lynn.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.284
I guess I'm gonna have to rely
on my worst-case scenario.

09:13.787 --> 09:17.856
I'm relatively sure
Brian won't marry a mime.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.191
He'd only run out
of things to say.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.332
[instrumental music]

09:28.201 --> 09:29.367
Here you go, ALF.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.403
I gave you some extra meat fat.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.405
Brian, is this
eating-on-the-floor thing

09:33.407 --> 09:35.407
gonna be permanent?

09:35.409 --> 09:36.708
I'm sorry.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.009
Roxanne doesn't want anything

09:38.011 --> 09:41.146
with fur at the table
unless she's wearing it.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.815
The cat gets to eat
at the table.

09:43.817 --> 09:47.752
I know it seems inconsistent,
but she says it's not.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.521
And I believe her.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.656
Your wife hates me.

09:51.658 --> 09:52.991
There you go again.

09:52.993 --> 09:56.027
You've got a persecution
complex a mile long.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.264
Brakes fail.
Elevator cables snap.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.732
Beds go aflame.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.735
All before lunch?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.203
Come on, B, what do you say

10:05.205 --> 10:07.806
we grab a few pillow cases
of this cash

10:07.808 --> 10:11.343
get some plastic surgery
and start over?

10:11.345 --> 10:15.480
ALF, Roxanne is my wife,
and I love her.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.148
Besides, her family's olive-oil

10:17.150 --> 10:20.018
business has been very good
for all of us.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.188
Oh, Brian, Brian.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.357
Stupid Brian.

10:25.359 --> 10:29.995
Have you seen one olive
in the last 20 years?

10:29.997 --> 10:34.933
Your wife runs the most powerful
mob family in North Hollywood.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.068
That's not true.
You take that back.

10:37.070 --> 10:41.806
Oh, come on. Why is there always
so much cash around here?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.743
Okay. Alright.
I asked her about that.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.044
She said a lot
of their olive oil

10:46.046 --> 10:47.946
is sold on freeway off-ramps.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.048
It's a cash business.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.520
- 'Hello, sweetheart.'
- I've missed you.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.061
Hey, Vinnie. Hey, Buck.

11:04.498 --> 11:08.066
Boys, why don't you wait outside
until the big concert tonight?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.202
I think it is so nice

11:11.204 --> 11:14.606
that you give them time off
to pursue their musical career.

11:14.608 --> 11:15.940
God.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.678
ALF, I brought you something.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.713
[gasps]

11:21.715 --> 11:23.815
Do you know what that means?

11:23.817 --> 11:26.351
Didn't Uncle Louie
get one of these

11:26.353 --> 11:30.155
just before
that freak welding accident?

11:32.659 --> 11:34.092
Hi, Mom and Dad.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.728
- Angel.
- Hello, Son.

11:36.730 --> 11:41.099
Brian, Jr. My favorite,
favorite child.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.302
It's bothering me again.

11:45.072 --> 11:48.139
Oh, don't worry, Brian.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.108
I gave it a black rose.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.078
Ciao.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.246
Honey, I'm gonna go into town.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.882
I'm gonna get a manicure
and a facial.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.051
Good idea. I'll go with you.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.586
I could use a mudpack.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.157
I don't want you leaving
the compound right now.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.726
I know, why don't you go

12:07.728 --> 12:10.762
upstairs and try on that nice,
little present I got you

12:10.764 --> 12:14.833
when I was in Washington at
those pesky committee hearings?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.101
Cool!

12:16.103 --> 12:19.104
- A guy could get used to this.
- Oh, you.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.174
Mom, yesterday I saw ALF
on the couch.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.543
And this time,

12:25.545 --> 12:27.412
I've got a fur ball to prove it.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.580
[gasps]

12:28.582 --> 12:29.748
[laughs]

12:29.750 --> 12:31.750
Oh, what a nice boy you are.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.318
Uh, but might I suggest

12:33.320 --> 12:36.421
that perhaps the fur ball
belongs to the cat?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.856
[Roxanne chuckles]

12:37.858 --> 12:40.859
You have never liked Fifi,
have you?

12:40.861 --> 12:41.893
Hmm?

12:41.895 --> 12:44.696
Me? I love that cat.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.364
What you may not know is

12:46.366 --> 12:49.134
we share the same
rare blood type.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.735
Which could come in handy

12:50.737 --> 12:55.573
if Fifi were ever caught in,
oh, say, musical crossfire.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.515
Boys, take Mr. Shumway

13:03.517 --> 13:07.852
to the amphitheater
and play for him.

13:07.854 --> 13:09.754
The amphitheater?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.756
It's not even finished yet.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.892
They're just now pouring
the ceme--

13:13.894 --> 13:16.394
[shouts]

13:16.396 --> 13:17.562
Brian!

13:21.234 --> 13:22.367
Wow.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.969
Imagine Brian being a kept man.

13:26.239 --> 13:29.240
Well, at least he found
something he's good at.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.043
[groans]

13:32.045 --> 13:35.980
Life stinks, and then 400 years
later, you die.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.684
Kind of a bummer, isn't it?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.060
[groans]

13:49.062 --> 13:52.564
Looks like I'm down
to my last Tanner.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.999
Little Eric.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.235
An amorphous pink blob.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.604
What can he do?

13:59.606 --> 14:03.174
He drools, he laughs
at stupid things

14:03.176 --> 14:06.778
he whines and cries
to get attention.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.514
Well, at least we have those
things in common.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.353
[squeeze box music]

14:20.026 --> 14:22.694
Shall we play another one,
Sparky?

14:22.696 --> 14:26.097
You go ahead.
I'll be by the water cooler.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.399
Oh, you're such a poop.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.134
Ow, ow!

14:30.136 --> 14:32.103
Not so hard, Eric.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.839
[laughing]

14:34.841 --> 14:37.242
You know what time
it is now, Sparky?

14:37.844 --> 14:38.877
Uh-oh.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.779
Yes! It's Mr. Mailbag time.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.250
Let's see.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.586
Here's a letter
from Billy Redseed

14:48.588 --> 14:50.221
of Portland, Oregon.

14:50.223 --> 14:55.693
And it seems Billy
has a fascination with fire.

14:57.163 --> 15:01.366
You know, these letters
should really be screened first.

15:01.368 --> 15:06.537
Billy would like to see Sparky
jump through hoops of flames.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.306
Fire, Sparky.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.677
I don't like where
television's going.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.446
Ta-da!

15:17.217 --> 15:18.850
You've gotta be kidding.

15:18.852 --> 15:21.419
I'll never get through those.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.222
Well, anybody can get through
the big ones.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.058
Now stop being Mr. Negative

15:27.060 --> 15:29.227
and show the boys
and girls at home

15:29.229 --> 15:33.765
that the body can achieve
what the mind can conceive.

15:33.767 --> 15:39.337
Oh, Mr. Eric, Mr. Sparky
Mr. Big Hand's on the 12.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.540
Oh, thank you, Mr. Big Hand.

15:42.542 --> 15:46.644
I'll take you out
for a Mr. Cocktail later.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.414
Well, that's all the time
we have for today, kids.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.716
But be sure to tune in next week

15:51.718 --> 15:56.387
for everybody's favorite
"Fun With Sharp Objects."

15:56.389 --> 15:57.722
Ow!

15:57.724 --> 15:59.791
See you next week.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.592
Right, Sparky?

16:01.594 --> 16:03.328
God willing.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.400
(male #1)
And we're out.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.670
Eric, are you crazy?

16:12.672 --> 16:15.974
I'm not jumping through
hoops of fire.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.443
First, you won't swim
through mud.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.911
Then you have a hissy fit

16:19.913 --> 16:21.713
about being thrown
through a window.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.515
And now you get upset
over a little fire.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.785
Where is it going to end?

16:27.787 --> 16:30.154
I don't need this, Eric.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.923
You're right.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.958
You don't need this.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.628
I'm gonna do something I should
have done a long time ago.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.263
Clean my box?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.867
I want you to meet someone.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.369
[whistles]

16:47.774 --> 16:50.274
Sparky, this is Bootsy.

16:50.276 --> 16:51.909
Bootsy, this is Sparky.

16:51.911 --> 16:55.880
Always a pleasure
to meet one of your dates.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.549
I have some bad news, Sparky.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.119
I don't want you
to take this personally

17:01.121 --> 17:03.721
but you're out of the act.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.922
What?

17:04.924 --> 17:08.826
How could you do this to me
after 30 years?

17:08.828 --> 17:10.661
I practically raised you.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.997
If it's the fire thing,
I'll do it.

17:12.999 --> 17:17.802
I'll jump through the stinking
hoops and land on sharp objects.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.872
Let's see Bootsy do that.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.274
ALF, don't humiliate yourself.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.676
- Goodbye.
- Hey, wait!

17:25.678 --> 17:29.680
Aw, Bootsy's giving you
a big Bootsy bye-bye.

17:29.682 --> 17:33.518
(ALF)
'Yeah, well, I'm giving Bootsy
a gesture of my own.'

17:33.520 --> 17:35.553
'Gee, it's dirty in here.'

17:40.026 --> 17:42.360
Well, the kids are a wash.

17:43.797 --> 17:47.298
I guess I'm gonna have to take
my chances with Willie and Kate.

17:49.002 --> 17:51.402
But Willie's my goombah.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.905
He'll hang on.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.606
And Kate?

17:55.608 --> 17:59.410
I'll just have to keep Willie
functional as long as possible.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.484
Beautiful day.

18:06.486 --> 18:11.355
Another beautiful, boring,
lonely, horrible day.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.927
I should drop dead.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.528
It could only help.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.998
ALF, go and open the curtain

18:21.000 --> 18:23.768
let me watch the sun
setting over the ocean.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.803
The curtains are open.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.742
Well, how come I
can't see the ocean?

18:31.744 --> 18:34.512
There is no ocean out there,
Willie.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.047
We live in the valley.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.850
It's landlocked. Like your mind.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.720
After all I've done for you

18:42.722 --> 18:46.157
you won't even let
me watch the sunset.

18:46.159 --> 18:49.260
I could've own that ocean
for what I've spent on you.

18:50.663 --> 18:51.963
Kate was right.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.066
"Let's drop him off
in the snow," she used to say.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.535
Did I listen?

18:57.537 --> 19:00.138
Oh, keep it down.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.906
Oh, there it is. I see it now.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.107
Thank you.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.510
Was that so difficult?

19:05.512 --> 19:09.480
ALF, can you forgive
a doddering, senile old man?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.748
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.351
Now I've got work to do, huh?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.986
Okay. Thank you.

19:17.056 --> 19:20.725
Hello, is this the
Taylor Ball Bearings Company?

19:22.195 --> 19:25.229
Um, do you have a Xerox copier.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.932
Well, you're in luck
because our company

19:27.934 --> 19:31.369
recently overstocked
on some name-brand toner--

19:31.371 --> 19:33.804
He's lying! It's a scam!
Don't fall for it!

19:33.806 --> 19:36.574
Did I mention that there's
a free gift involved?

19:36.576 --> 19:39.243
No, no, no! Scam! Scam! Scam!

19:39.245 --> 19:41.379
May I call you back?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.514
Yes, thank you.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.952
What are you doing?

19:50.056 --> 19:52.223
Nothing.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.725
You just lost me another client.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.261
I'm sorry. Go on,
make another phone call.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.430
I won't interrupt again.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.233
I promise. Really.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.569
[Kate laughing]

20:06.439 --> 20:08.839
Now what?

20:08.841 --> 20:10.441
Grease fire.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.277
Curtains, whoosh!

20:13.279 --> 20:15.646
Old, batty, over-medicated.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.282
Look at those seagulls.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.750
They carry diseases, you know?

20:19.752 --> 20:22.386
I can't prove it,
but I know they do.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.724
I hope the kids
like these afghans.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.326
I'm making them big enough

20:28.328 --> 20:31.862
so they can tent
their homes in winter.

20:31.864 --> 20:35.433
Better not come in here, the
filthy, germ-infested vermin.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.934
Oh, don't worry.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.136
I think they're living
in Seattle now.

20:40.707 --> 20:44.675
What did I tell you about using
the stove without supervision?

20:44.677 --> 20:45.910
Huh?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.412
- You know it's off-limits.
- Okay, okay.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.049
Hey, I've got a secret.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.654
I've got my bra on backwards.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.725
Big deal.
So does Willie.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.596
Tattletale.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.065
No good. No damn good!

21:08.067 --> 21:09.433
You were right.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.203
We should have dropped
him off in the snow.

21:12.205 --> 21:15.406
Why don't you read us that nice
letter we just got from Lynnie?

21:16.209 --> 21:20.344
Because it came three years ago.

21:20.346 --> 21:23.281
And I've read it
to you 500 times.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.616
And it was a postcard.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.485
I worked my whole life
to support him.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.820
And now he won't even read us
our mail.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.455
Then at least describe
the stamp.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.691
Is that too much to ask?

21:36.296 --> 21:39.030
Hello, Alien Task Force?

21:39.032 --> 21:42.700
Yes, I'm an alien
and I'd like to turn myself in.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.468
I know it involves dissection.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.503
That's fine.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.104
In fact, I welcome it.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.206
Just get me out of here!

21:57.750 --> 21:59.483
ALF, I hope you realize

21:59.485 --> 22:01.686
we'd never do
any of those things.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.789
And thanks for having
such a high opinion of us.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.224
ALF, I know you're
really worried

22:07.226 --> 22:09.493
and you have every right to be

22:09.495 --> 22:13.564
but just tell me one thing
did I have all my hair?

22:13.566 --> 22:18.169
Your hair was the least
of your problems.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.503
ALF, no matter what happens

22:19.505 --> 22:20.971
as long as you have
to stay hidden

22:20.973 --> 22:23.708
we'll always
make provisions for you.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.544
Prove it.
Put the house in my name.

22:33.052 --> 22:36.053
[theme music]
