00:03.870 --> 00:06.171
<i>[narrator] Last season
on 1000-lb Sisters...</i>

00:06.206 --> 00:09.475
Amy, you're making some
men's fantasy... or maybe woman.

00:09.542 --> 00:10.976
Oh, yeah.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.211
[retches]

00:12.278 --> 00:13.545
I'm pregnant.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.616
[chuckles]

00:17.618 --> 00:20.019
<i>[Amy] It's only been a couple
months since I had the surgery.</i>

00:20.086 --> 00:25.224
And Dr. Proctor told me not
to get pregnant for two years.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.026
Oops.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.101
COVID [bleep] sucks.

00:36.169 --> 00:37.002
[chuckles]

00:37.037 --> 00:39.071
[grunting]

00:44.077 --> 00:46.879
How about I join you
on the weight loss journey?

00:46.913 --> 00:50.249
It's not going to hurt me
a bit to start dieting too.

00:50.316 --> 00:53.152
All right? Let's get it, girl.

01:03.963 --> 01:05.998
Yes.

01:06.065 --> 01:08.400
- Do you want her to get the surgery?
- Yeah.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.003
Hmm.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.945
<i>[Chris] I did get approved
for surgery.</i>

01:20.012 --> 01:21.914
379 and a half.

01:21.948 --> 01:24.983
Great job, man. Nice job.

01:26.953 --> 01:31.223
After all this hard work,
all the weight loss, I made it.

01:31.290 --> 01:34.560
I can just breathe
knowing he's fine.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.495
He's perfect.

01:42.535 --> 01:46.772
I know you love him, but Jerry
does not need to be your enabler.

01:46.806 --> 01:47.873
He's not.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.341
Tell me you got
a food addiction.

01:49.408 --> 01:51.477
Don't sit there and play
no [bleep] games with me.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.440
Yeah.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.418
[laughs]

02:36.656 --> 02:38.690
And I'm finally living the dream

02:38.725 --> 02:42.161
that I wanted my whole life
that was to become a mother.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.997
When you going
to grow some hair?

02:49.869 --> 02:52.771
Look how big mommy was
in these pictures.

02:52.805 --> 02:56.542
Mommy was 406 pounds.

02:56.643 --> 03:01.046
I went from 5XL to an XL.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.716
<i>I've lost 40 pounds
after I had Gage.</i>

03:04.751 --> 03:07.252
<i>And now I'm down to 260.</i>

03:11.057 --> 03:13.458
I was gonna film
a YouTube video.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.628
I was in the end
of my rope with Tammy.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.530
I didn't know
what to do with her.

03:18.765 --> 03:22.267
But I got some big news
to tell my subscribers.

03:28.074 --> 03:30.008
Hey, y'all. It's Amy.

03:30.043 --> 03:34.179
And today, I need to talk to y'all
about some serious stuff that's going on.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.315
Y'all know,
I tell y'all everything,

03:36.382 --> 03:38.417
the good, the bad, the ugly.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.085
But...

03:40.119 --> 03:46.124
I just need to let y'all know something
that kind of came up unexpectedly.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.560
Do y'all want to know
what it is?

03:49.128 --> 03:50.195
Y'all...

03:50.197 --> 03:53.699
Tammy finally got into rehab
for food addiction.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.034
That's a big deal.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.305
She actually came to me and said,
"Hey, I need help. I need a rehab."

04:09.916 --> 04:11.516
Okay.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.020
So y'all just keep hearing
your thoughts and prayers.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.557
Bye, YouTube, subscribe.

04:23.363 --> 04:28.000
[panting]

05:53.252 --> 05:56.555
[laughing]

06:06.866 --> 06:08.400
Yes.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.709
<i>[Amy] I'm gonna miss Tammy
but I know it's for the best.</i>

06:17.744 --> 06:19.644
<i>I'm ready to get her out.</i>

06:19.679 --> 06:25.016
<i>So she can take the steps
she needs to do stuff for herself.</i>

06:25.050 --> 06:27.786
I could focus on my son
and focus on his stuff.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.222
<i>Because right now,
I have to do everything,</i>

06:30.289 --> 06:33.291
<i>do her dishes, her laundry,
gonna go get her food.</i>

06:33.359 --> 06:35.026
<i>I'm having to do it all.</i>

06:35.094 --> 06:36.161
Your footies.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.068
Yeah.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.175
Gage.

06:54.013 --> 06:55.013
[chuckles]

06:55.281 --> 06:57.082
[laughs]

06:58.351 --> 07:00.018
What?

07:00.353 --> 07:01.453
Get it off.

07:01.988 --> 07:02.821
[screams]

07:02.855 --> 07:06.958
[laughing]

07:28.581 --> 07:30.849
Right now,
the most important thing

07:30.883 --> 07:37.122
is to get Tammy to the rehab
facility for her food addiction.

07:37.156 --> 07:42.093
<i>What's kind of crazy is, I first
started my diet just to help push her.</i>

07:42.161 --> 07:44.129
I got down to 380 pounds.

07:44.163 --> 07:47.499
<i>And I got approved
for bariatric surgery.</i>

07:53.072 --> 07:55.440
- Hey, Tammy.
- [Tammy] Hey.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.148
[Tammy] Yeah.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.954
[groans]

08:09.489 --> 08:11.423
<i>[Chris] It's really hard
on my heart</i>

08:11.491 --> 08:17.329
to see her not being able to walk
the 30 straight steps to the van.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.148
I thought it changed.

09:03.776 --> 09:08.246
Tammy, you was happy or I
thought you was happy with him.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.016
But it was a toxic relationship

09:11.050 --> 09:13.318
because how are you
gonna love fat people

09:13.385 --> 09:15.153
and try to help them
lose weight?

09:15.187 --> 09:16.254
You can't do it.

09:22.361 --> 09:23.962
Yeah.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.117
[laughs]

09:46.152 --> 09:49.821
<i>[Amy] I'm kind of pissed off
that Tammy saw Jerry</i>

09:49.855 --> 09:52.657
a couple days
before going to rehab.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.226
Because he is a feeder
at the end of the day.

10:32.331 --> 10:35.400
Tammy, it ain't gonna hurt you
to make a friend.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.071
Yeah.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.485
[laughs]

11:36.295 --> 11:40.932
<i>♪ I'm coming forward tonight ♪</i>

11:44.770 --> 11:50.375
<i>♪ I'm coming forward tonight ♪</i>

11:55.581 --> 11:59.951
<i>[Chris] Taking Tammy to this facility
is one of the last options we have.</i>

12:00.018 --> 12:04.055
Because she just needs help
that we're not able to give.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.558
Oh. Ow, ow, ow!

12:06.625 --> 12:07.825
[grunts]

12:16.001 --> 12:19.003
Hopefully, we don't have
problems with that this round.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.940
Don't be too much of an
[bleep] for these people.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.676
[bleep] you can be rough.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.479
[laughs]

12:28.047 --> 12:29.714
Just remember,
they're here to help you.

12:29.782 --> 12:33.785
No matter how much they are
pushing you and you get mad at them.

12:33.852 --> 12:37.322
You know, I pray Tammy stays at
the facility and gets the help she needs.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.068
<i>[Amy] Now that Tammy's away,</i>

12:50.135 --> 12:52.470
I have a goal
of 150 pounds to get to.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.507
-Are we slow?
-You can go slow. No, you're fine.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.541
<i>[Amy] Lunges...</i>

12:58.144 --> 12:59.811
I thought they were
saying lunch.

12:59.878 --> 13:01.045
[laughs]

13:02.515 --> 13:04.916
I've been in rehab
for two weeks.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.018
<i>I'm trying to get me walk more.</i>

13:39.819 --> 13:44.789
Potatoes, green beans,
sugar free juice.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.324
The food here sucks.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.127
It's bland. No flavor.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.733
Here, they would only
give me one sandwich.

13:55.768 --> 13:59.237
And back home,
I'd eat like three or four.

14:00.806 --> 14:04.008
<i>My knees are grinding
the bones grind.</i>

14:04.043 --> 14:07.078
<i>So the whole therapy
where you stand up,</i>

14:07.112 --> 14:10.181
sit down, kills my knees.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.084
[sighs]

15:02.167 --> 15:04.569
Oh, you're getting heavy.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.142
- Hey.
- Oh. Love you.

15:11.176 --> 15:14.979
But I haven't really been eating
the healthiest since Gage was born.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.283
<i>So I need this exercise.</i>

15:28.394 --> 15:29.861
Great job, ladies.

15:29.928 --> 15:31.296
So good.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.510
They look like
they go drink rose.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.079
[Kara] Hi, welcome.

15:48.146 --> 15:49.981
-Hi.
-[Amy] How are you? Nice to meet you.

15:50.015 --> 15:51.215
I'm Kara. Who's this?

15:51.283 --> 15:52.951
- Gage.
- This is Gage.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.752
Oh, my Gosh, Gage.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.988
Oh, my God.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.823
My first impression of them is,

15:58.890 --> 16:02.961
"Oh, my God, they are kind
of cool even for uptight people."

16:03.028 --> 16:04.529
- Are you ready for class?
- [Amy] Yes.

16:04.730 --> 16:05.997
[Kara] It's gonna be great.

16:06.031 --> 16:06.764
Yeah, it's gonna be awesome.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.433
[woman] Excited to have you.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.541
So everyone makes
a little circle.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.843
Then you're just gonna do
a little side shuffle.

16:18.910 --> 16:22.246
Three, two, one. Here we go.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.249
[Kara]
Let's go to the next one.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.086
Oh, okay.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.121
One more time.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.542
We're gonna go
into that slow lunge walk.

16:52.211 --> 16:55.079
You can go slow. No,
you're fine. You're good.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.255
[Kara]
Take that right arm across.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.025
[Amy] I'm glad
I do put deodorant on.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.127
[laughter]

17:09.161 --> 17:09.861
[Kara] And switch.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.162
And a shave.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.298
[Kara] Carefully release,
interlace those fingers together.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.700
Thanks, everybody.
Great job today.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.168
Amazing.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.439
I'm sore as [bleep]
but I'm happy.

17:28.313 --> 17:32.016
<i>So it's nice to get
a little taste of freedom.</i>

17:33.619 --> 17:35.086
[laughs]

17:35.120 --> 17:38.056
Are you ready to get
in the car, big boy?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.520
[chuckles]

18:21.667 --> 18:23.501
They have me doing
a lot of exercises

18:23.568 --> 18:26.204
and trying to get me
to walk more.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.513
[panting]

18:43.789 --> 18:45.823
<i>I'm missing so much.
I miss my bed.</i>

18:45.858 --> 18:49.827
I miss my house.
I miss my own things.

18:49.861 --> 18:51.696
<i>[Chris] Tammy says she's got
something to tell us,</i>

18:51.730 --> 18:54.232
kind of worried about
what she's got to say.

19:25.697 --> 19:31.002
Chris pulls up and I'm like,
he gained some weight.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.240
[bleep] 40 pounds
ain't no water weight.

19:46.818 --> 19:49.220
The last six weeks
has been pretty crazy.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.189
<i>I had an emergency surgery
on my leg,</i>

19:51.223 --> 19:55.893
<i>which pretty much kept me
kind of bedridden for 45 days.</i>

19:55.961 --> 19:58.896
During that time,
I gained 40 pounds.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.999
<i>And now, I'm back up to 420.</i>

20:02.034 --> 20:05.536
And it's just been hell
on wheels.

20:20.085 --> 20:22.486
<i>Being overweight,
you have a lot of trouble</i>

20:22.521 --> 20:25.489
<i>with yeast infections
in your fat rolls.</i>

20:25.524 --> 20:28.526
And that's part
of what happened on my leg.

20:39.104 --> 20:40.238
[laughs]

20:42.341 --> 20:43.441
Yeah, yeah.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.010
[laughs]

20:47.946 --> 20:49.480
[laughs]

20:55.854 --> 20:59.090
[laughing]

21:00.859 --> 21:02.493
Okay.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.841
<i>You know, the big thing
about bariatric surgery</i>

21:16.908 --> 21:20.511
<i>is it's going to lengthen
my lifespan by 20 years.</i>

21:20.578 --> 21:24.448
So, if I don't get it, I'm not
going to be around much longer.

21:24.516 --> 21:27.551
<i>And that's just...
it's really heartbreaking</i>

21:27.753 --> 21:32.089
because basically, all this
work I've did is not for [bleep]

21:32.124 --> 21:34.025
if I don't get the surgery.

21:45.170 --> 21:46.304
Oh, oh.

22:08.193 --> 22:09.627
- Okay. You ready?
- Yeah.

22:09.694 --> 22:10.761
Here we go.

22:13.198 --> 22:16.334
When you get on it and stand,
just drop your arms.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.103
[woman] Let's do it.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.090
[woman] 631.3.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.025
How do you feel about that?

22:44.129 --> 22:46.530
It is a lot. It is.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.673
That's progress.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.109
Well, I'm proud of you.

22:58.143 --> 23:00.478
[woman] How do you feel
about it? You feel pretty good?

23:19.531 --> 23:21.031
[Kelly] Okay, Tammy.

23:21.033 --> 23:24.368
We're eight weeks in and I wanted
to see what were you thinking about.

23:37.716 --> 23:42.386
Tammy, are you sure that you're ready
to go home on your own without support

23:42.454 --> 23:46.123
and face all the temptations
when you get there by yourself?

23:46.191 --> 23:47.358
Yes.

23:57.669 --> 23:59.103
You have to get that meal prep

23:59.137 --> 24:05.009
and not order out and stay
in your calorie count diet.

24:11.583 --> 24:12.950
You feel like when you go home,

24:13.017 --> 24:15.386
you're gonna... you take
your start to order out again?

24:17.289 --> 24:18.389
So you're not gonna...

24:21.927 --> 24:22.726
Mm-hm.

24:22.761 --> 24:24.728
See, I worry about that part.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.931
You know, ordering out is
gonna be the biggest obstacle

24:26.965 --> 24:29.099
that I think
that you're gonna have.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.069
<i>I feel that if Tammy would stay,</i>

24:32.103 --> 24:33.838
we could continue
giving her the tools

24:33.905 --> 24:35.305
<i>to not order out</i>

24:35.941 --> 24:38.943
<i>to continue just to stick
to her diet a little bit longer.</i>

24:40.045 --> 24:41.946
I worry about Tammy when
there's not somebody there

24:41.980 --> 24:44.315
<i>to help her make
those good decisions.</i>

24:58.029 --> 25:01.999
I'm heading over to Amy's
house to talk to Amy and Misty.

25:02.066 --> 25:05.903
Because Tammy says she's got
something to tell us.

25:05.937 --> 25:08.439
I'm kind of worried
about what she's got to say.

25:09.941 --> 25:12.510
- What's up bitch?
- Bitch.

25:12.544 --> 25:14.011
- [Misty] You want a sandwich, boobie?
- [Chris] No, I'm good.

25:14.078 --> 25:16.914
I try to stay away from it all.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.849
<i>The past weeks
has been pretty crazy.</i>

25:18.884 --> 25:21.018
<i>I have been eating right</i>

25:21.085 --> 25:24.121
<i>and following a diet to lose
the 40 pounds I gained.</i>

25:24.155 --> 25:26.223
<i>But, you know,
it's a whole lot easier</i>

25:26.291 --> 25:29.126
to put weight on
than it is to take it off.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.995
And that's just the way it is.

25:36.968 --> 25:38.068
Okay.

25:39.971 --> 25:41.338
[line ringing]

25:42.140 --> 25:43.407
Hi, bitch.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.144
<i>[Tammy] Yeah, it's going.</i>

25:50.248 --> 25:53.517
I miss my own things.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.967
I... I mean...

26:14.239 --> 26:15.406
Yeah.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.342
That is total [bleep].

26:18.409 --> 26:21.545
So how much weight
have you lost totally?

26:23.081 --> 26:26.951
[Misty] I thought you were supposed to
stay up there until you lost 100 pounds.

26:47.038 --> 26:50.007
I'm not giving up,
just because I'm homesick

26:50.041 --> 26:54.078
and want to come home
does not mean I'm giving up.

26:57.916 --> 26:59.717
[Misty] I'm not mad at you
about anything.

26:59.784 --> 27:00.951
I'm not mad at you.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.520
But I'm disappointed
that you're coming home early.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.526
All right.
We'll talk to you later.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.028
[Misty] Love you.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.464
Bye.

27:14.599 --> 27:16.066
[Misty] I think
if she comes back here,

27:16.134 --> 27:20.604
I'd probably give her like a 20%,
30% of actually accomplishing it.

27:20.672 --> 27:23.874
Whatever temptation
is in front of her,

27:23.908 --> 27:25.743
she'll be like, "Oh,
this one time won't matter."

27:25.810 --> 27:27.511
She's like,
"Oh, this is a cheat day."

27:30.115 --> 27:32.082
I think she's where
she needs to be

27:32.116 --> 27:37.121
in a place that can control,
you know, be structured.

28:02.047 --> 28:05.716
Tammy's an addict and there's no
difference between a food addiction

28:05.783 --> 28:07.351
than a heroin addiction.

28:07.385 --> 28:10.087
She was talking
about ordering out burgers.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.270
[Brittany] Yeah.

28:45.523 --> 28:47.057
[Brittany] Yeah.

28:57.335 --> 28:58.935
[Chris]
<i>When I dropped Tammy off,</i>

28:58.937 --> 29:03.140
I had high hopes that she was actually
going to taking the right step forward.

29:03.908 --> 29:07.010
But she hasn't made her hundred
pound weight goal yet.

29:07.078 --> 29:11.515
<i>So doubts are really setting in</i>

29:11.549 --> 29:14.485
if she's going to stick to
the diet after she gets home.

29:18.323 --> 29:20.724
[Chris] Hey, Tammy.
How's it going?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.026
[Tammy] Good, good.

29:51.489 --> 29:54.625
Kelly, do you have any advice
on the situation?

29:54.659 --> 29:58.796
I just think that she's gonna need
people there that can back her up

29:58.863 --> 30:02.232
and to help her say, no,
she's done really good here.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.433
The only thing that I was
a little worried about,

30:03.468 --> 30:05.169
she was talking
about ordering out burgers.

30:06.704 --> 30:10.507
A couple times Tammy cheated, but
she feels like she's been given the tools

30:10.542 --> 30:12.709
that she can say no
to the cheating.

30:12.744 --> 30:16.747
I just hope that she continues on
the path that she's on here right now.

30:16.814 --> 30:18.849
I just want her to do good.
She's done so well.

30:18.883 --> 30:20.884
I just want her to continue

30:20.952 --> 30:25.289
and on the path that she's on
going in the right direction.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.892
I think she's gonna need
a lot of support.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.729
Tammy's an addict and there's no
difference between a food addiction

30:32.764 --> 30:34.164
than a heroin addiction.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.067
<i>They got to want to get better.</i>

30:37.535 --> 30:39.336
<i>Forcing Tammy to stay there,</i>

30:39.370 --> 30:42.105
<i>she's not going to do
anything the doctors want</i>

30:42.173 --> 30:45.175
and she's liable to get
kicked out of the facility

30:45.243 --> 30:47.411
if we put her in that situation.

30:50.648 --> 30:52.516
Ow.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.185
Remember what I told you.
Just keep saying no.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.887
- Yes.
- Okay?

30:56.921 --> 30:59.990
If you need us
for anything, call us.

31:00.057 --> 31:01.158
- Bye, good luck.
- Thank you.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.926
[Kelly] All right.

31:02.994 --> 31:05.062
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.999
[Tammy] Yes.

31:29.420 --> 31:32.055
[Chris] Tammy, we home, by God.

31:48.973 --> 31:50.140
For what?

31:53.077 --> 31:54.511
<i>Even though,
I'm happy to see Tammy.</i>

31:54.578 --> 31:57.247
<i>We don't really show emotions
in this family.</i>

31:57.315 --> 32:01.518
But I didn't expect her to bite my
head off when she came in the door.

32:03.221 --> 32:07.124
[Gage mumbling]

32:07.191 --> 32:11.962
[inaudible]
What are you doing?

32:11.996 --> 32:16.233
Huh? [inaudible]

32:43.828 --> 32:45.495
[Amy] Yeah.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.833
<i>Even though I don't agree
with Tammy coming home.</i>

32:49.900 --> 32:51.001
<i>I still wanted to make
the place right</i>

32:51.035 --> 32:53.837
<i>and make her feel
like she was missed.</i>

32:53.904 --> 32:56.173
Because that's what sisters do.

32:59.043 --> 33:01.979
Hey, what are you doing?

33:02.046 --> 33:05.148
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

33:18.096 --> 33:19.496
[laughs]

33:28.806 --> 33:30.107
Open it.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.545
Tammy can't use
the kitchen stove

33:35.613 --> 33:38.515
because the knobs
are so far away

33:38.850 --> 33:41.184
and her belly gets
in between her and the stove.

33:41.986 --> 33:44.121
Oh, crap.

33:45.056 --> 33:48.191
<i>[Amy] So I gave Tammy
this cook top and this table.</i>

33:48.226 --> 33:49.793
<i>So she can be independent.</i>

33:49.827 --> 33:52.229
And I ain't got to do it
for her.

34:00.805 --> 34:04.441
So we got it to help you
be more independent.

34:24.529 --> 34:29.232
We cannot let you continue
the way you were.

34:31.936 --> 34:34.004
I understand that and I'm glad.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.506
But at the same time,

34:38.209 --> 34:40.544
there's gonna have
to be rules, you know,

34:40.912 --> 34:42.512
some... some rules set.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.530
[Chris] We're gonna hold you
accountable

35:00.631 --> 35:03.400
because we ain't taking
no [bleep].

35:07.038 --> 35:11.108
Yes, I need to call in some
medicine for Tammy Slaton.

35:11.175 --> 35:14.044
She's out there doing
a YouTube video with Emily.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.014
Okay, but you see
what I'm doing.

35:18.049 --> 35:19.950
I can't stop and do it.

35:20.985 --> 35:23.253
[growls]

36:18.009 --> 36:23.146
Yes, I need to call in some
medicine for Tammy Slaton.

36:33.391 --> 36:35.792
You're just walking with your
butt in front of the camera.

36:35.826 --> 36:39.162
Nobody wants to see
your holy ass.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.303
- What's up?
- [Tammy] What's up?

36:56.080 --> 36:58.248
[laughs]

37:13.831 --> 37:15.298
Hey, y'all. It's Tammy.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.733
This is my niece Emily.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.668
Today, we are...

37:18.736 --> 37:23.540
Doing a how-to tutorial
on how to burn your ex,

37:23.874 --> 37:26.910
burn your ex [bleep] way
better than burning calories.

37:26.944 --> 37:29.012
[laughs]

37:32.683 --> 37:34.951
<i>[Emily] I'm glad she's home
from rehab.</i>

37:34.985 --> 37:37.520
I think she is happier
since her ex is out of her life.

37:37.555 --> 37:40.323
We put in my extra shirts
he left it at my house

37:40.358 --> 37:41.925
after he tried
to stay the night,

37:41.959 --> 37:43.927
a hoodie that he left because he
told me I have to wear it in my sleep,

37:43.961 --> 37:45.762
Jerry's shirt,
his crusty old socks,

37:45.829 --> 37:51.234
a toothbrush that he left here
and his wacky ass hairbrush.

38:17.995 --> 38:21.765
Pour some kerosene in
there, lightly. That's enough.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.867
You're trying to kill us.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.502
Strike it. Drop it. Run.

38:28.339 --> 38:29.906
Boom.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.442
Bye, bitches!

38:39.083 --> 38:41.084
- Good.
- Actually I really do.

38:41.151 --> 38:44.020
- This fire represents...
- [bleep]

38:44.088 --> 38:45.188
[laugh]

38:45.222 --> 38:46.556
Everybody's got one.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.360
[Tammy] What?

38:53.931 --> 38:56.099
I can't do it, Amy.

39:00.204 --> 39:02.806
Tell them
that I'm [bleep] filming.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.274
I'm just...

39:05.409 --> 39:07.577
[Tammy] Okay, but you see
what I'm doing.

39:07.644 --> 39:12.916
<i>[Amy] I'm trying to get her medicine but
her doctor needs to know this information.</i>

39:12.983 --> 39:15.785
Tammy's the only one that
knows her medical history.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.254
I can't stop and do it.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.126
[Tammy] Shut the [bleep] up.
Get [bleep] house.

39:25.896 --> 39:28.031
Why I'm being over here being
a grown up cleaning my house,

39:28.065 --> 39:29.999
taking care of Tammy's drama.

39:30.067 --> 39:33.870
<i>She's out there doing
a YouTube video with Emily.</i>

39:33.937 --> 39:36.673
I don't know why my
stupid sister couldn't do this.

39:36.740 --> 39:39.409
[Amy] This got nothing
to do with me!

39:41.946 --> 39:44.914
She needs to grow up and
take care of her own stuff.

39:44.949 --> 39:48.351
This is the final straw.
I can't take no more.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.756
She's gone too far
this time and I'm done.

39:52.823 --> 39:56.659
Having Tammy staying at
rehab those last eight weeks,

39:56.694 --> 39:58.928
I got to spend with my son
and my husband

39:58.963 --> 40:01.564
and not have to worry
about outside drama.

40:01.832 --> 40:05.001
<i>And I can't and I won't go
back the way things were.</i>

40:05.035 --> 40:06.269
[bleep] bitch.

40:07.605 --> 40:09.372
[growls]

40:18.816 --> 40:22.886
I was just trying to help her
get her medicine and stuff.

40:22.920 --> 40:27.457
But yet, she's yelling at me for
doing what she won't-- asked me to do.

40:28.959 --> 40:31.094
You need to quit calling
people [bleep] stupid.

40:31.128 --> 40:33.062
I'm not the stupid one.

40:33.130 --> 40:36.466
[Tammy] My thing is though,
you had my medicine list,

40:36.533 --> 40:38.968
you could have done
what I asked.

40:39.003 --> 40:41.104
But you didn't have to talk
to me like I was a dog.

40:41.138 --> 40:43.907
Okay, but you knew
I was doing something.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.876
Don't [bleep] scold me
like a child, stupid.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.646
Stop calling damn stupid.
I'm tired of your...

40:49.680 --> 40:51.247
Shut up.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.715
I'm gonna leave
if you keep calling.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.083
Okay, leave, bitch.

40:54.151 --> 40:56.920
I was trying to have fun
with you, stupid.

40:56.954 --> 40:59.823
- That's it. I'm done.
- Okay.

40:59.890 --> 41:02.358
[Amy] I told her
three [bleep] times.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.961
[Tammy] I don't care.

41:06.897 --> 41:09.165
I told her [bleep] three times.

41:09.233 --> 41:12.168
-I'm done.
-You don't [bleep] tell me nothing.

41:24.548 --> 41:28.117
- Here's to being 35!
- [all cheering]

41:28.185 --> 41:31.020
[Amy] This season
on "1000-lb Sisters"...

41:31.055 --> 41:33.056
I am from the planet Mars.

41:33.123 --> 41:34.491
Whee!

41:34.525 --> 41:36.025
Ah!
[laughing]

41:36.927 --> 41:39.229
It said I weighed F.
[laughs]

41:39.263 --> 41:43.399
F for what?
[bleep] fat ass?

41:47.771 --> 41:51.140
"If you get down to 299..."

41:51.909 --> 41:54.978
He don't like Tammy.
He's got a fetish.

41:59.116 --> 42:01.184
Why can't I [bleep]
just be happy

42:01.218 --> 42:02.485
for once?

42:02.553 --> 42:05.021
Answer me this --
Are you engaged?

42:05.823 --> 42:08.057
I hope to God
it's really not true.

42:09.126 --> 42:10.894
Everybody day "whiskey."

42:10.961 --> 42:12.228
[all] Whiskey.

42:12.296 --> 42:14.998
We're going on
a family vacation, y'all.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.900
[Amy] Ah, hell yeah!

42:16.967 --> 42:19.035
It's got a sprayer for your
booty crack.

42:19.102 --> 42:20.937
Girl, we can roll with this.

42:20.971 --> 42:23.740
[Amy] My sister Amanda
has no filter.

42:23.774 --> 42:26.543
Why you diggin' in your [bleep]?

42:26.744 --> 42:29.012
Because I have stuff
in my pocket, okay?

42:29.046 --> 42:31.147
It's my pocket, excuse me.

42:31.181 --> 42:33.950
But sometimes she gets
a little bit rough.

42:33.984 --> 42:35.051
It's rude.

42:35.118 --> 42:37.120
No, what's rude is you keep
running your [bleep]...

42:37.187 --> 42:38.855
Bitch, don't try me like that.

42:38.922 --> 42:41.491
She wants to talk to me like
she's lost her mind -- no.

42:41.525 --> 42:42.692
This girl don't play that.

42:42.726 --> 42:43.927
How about you just
shut up for once?

42:43.994 --> 42:46.095
How about you get out that
[bleep] chair and make me?

42:46.130 --> 42:47.463
- I [bleep] will, bitch.
- Get the [bleep] up then.

42:47.531 --> 42:49.566
You won't shut up!

42:49.833 --> 42:53.269
How am I supposed to [bleep] say
anything if you keep talking?!

42:54.104 --> 42:55.271
I'm scared.

42:55.339 --> 42:57.407
You know, there's always a fear
that you don't wake up.

42:58.976 --> 43:01.878
Immediately I see that Chris's
liver is pretty big.

43:01.945 --> 43:02.946
This can be very, very serious.

43:03.013 --> 43:04.681
[machine beeping]

43:04.748 --> 43:06.849
- I think this could be a winner.
- Yep.

43:06.884 --> 43:09.519
[Amy] I'm done.
We're moving out.

43:09.820 --> 43:12.555
I told her that when I had my
son, everything's gonna be

43:12.756 --> 43:13.890
about him,

43:13.957 --> 43:16.059
but Tammy's gone backwards.

43:19.029 --> 43:19.962
[Amy] What do we do now?

43:19.964 --> 43:23.066
<i>It's like the Titanic
slowly sinking,</i>

43:23.133 --> 43:26.002
and there's only so much
people can take from her.

43:27.905 --> 43:30.006
Okay, but you see
what I'm doing!

43:30.040 --> 43:31.841
<i>[Amy] I'm trying
to get her medicine,</i>

43:31.908 --> 43:34.010
and she's out there doing
a YouTube video.

43:34.044 --> 43:36.479
I can't stop and do it!

43:36.513 --> 43:37.513
[growls]

43:38.949 --> 43:41.784
Stop calling damn stupid.
I'm tired of [bleep].

43:41.852 --> 43:43.419
[Tammy] Stupid.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.954
That's it.
I'm done.

43:44.989 --> 43:46.189
[Tammy] I don't care.

43:46.256 --> 43:48.558
I told her [bleep] three times!

43:48.959 --> 43:50.259
I'm done!
