WEBVTT

00:17.350 --> 00:20.270
- Glad you brought
your swim trunks.

00:20.353 --> 00:24.441
- Yeah.
It's very refreshing.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.694
Water really takes
it out of you, though.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.372
You sure, uh...

00:39.456 --> 00:41.624
Byron's not hiding
around a corner somewhere?

00:41.708 --> 00:43.126
- I told you,
you don't need to worry

00:43.209 --> 00:44.919
about Byron anymore.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.046
- I've heard that before.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.551
- Well, that time I lied.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.428
I used to feel
very comfortable lying.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.055
- Yeah, yeah.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.642
I've, uh, noticed that
on occasion.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.688
What do you, uh,
attribute that to?

01:03.772 --> 01:06.149
- I guess I didn't want
to feel the truth.

01:09.068 --> 01:12.322
Maybe I didn't think
I could stand feeling it.

01:12.405 --> 01:16.201
But now I know I can stand it.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.994
- You okay?

01:21.289 --> 01:23.416
- Yeah.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.045
- Don't take this the--
the wrong way.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.672
I--I'm not happy
Byron shoved you

01:29.756 --> 01:32.509
into a computer or whatever,

01:32.592 --> 01:34.552
but, uh,
since you've been back,

01:34.636 --> 01:37.847
you seem...better.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.018
At peace or something.

01:42.101 --> 01:44.854
It's not 'cause
you killed him, is it?

01:44.938 --> 01:48.107
Actually, don't--don't answer.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.193
If I don't know,
it protects us both.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.361
The hell is this?

02:33.444 --> 02:36.614
Well, you really can't
buy taste, can you?

02:36.698 --> 02:38.449
- Dad?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.454
I'm sorry for tricking you

02:43.538 --> 02:45.790
and taking you back here
to the Hub.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.002
Can you forgive me?

02:49.085 --> 02:53.464
- Are you kidding me?
I--of course.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.593
I already did.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.678
- I love you, Dad.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.222
- Yeah. Me too.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.190
- Dad!

03:12.817 --> 03:15.653
That's not me!

03:15.737 --> 03:17.780
Dad!

03:30.793 --> 03:32.754
- What's all this?
- Hi.

03:32.837 --> 03:36.299
You must have been tired.
You were out for a while.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.009
- What, uh--

03:38.092 --> 03:41.137
what, are we having company
or something?

03:41.220 --> 03:44.265
- No.
Just us.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.685
I thought I would make it nice.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.562
Here.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.565
See if you recognize this.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.323
Is that, uh...
- Mom's recipe.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.908
Yup.

04:01.991 --> 04:05.453
- I thought she never
wrote it down though.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.038
I remember we--we looked.

04:07.121 --> 04:10.833
We looked all through
the note cards and cookbooks.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.002
- I used the Mom phone
that Byron made for me

04:13.086 --> 04:16.172
to call her up
and ask her about it.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.508
- I didn't think
I'd ever taste that again.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.310
- That is so good.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.816
What?
- What'd you do to the hair?

04:34.899 --> 04:37.568
I never saw you wear
your hair like that.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.697
- I don't know.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.323
Just trying something new,
I guess.

04:46.452 --> 04:50.039
- Um, okay.
I'm gonna wash up.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.170
So good.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.463
- Mm-hmm.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.967
- To Mom's sauce.
Hmm?

05:01.050 --> 05:03.261
- To Mom's sauce.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.638
- What?

05:05.722 --> 05:07.181
- Come on.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.350
- Are you letting me win?
- I wish.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.352
Maybe you're cheating.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.563
All right, one more.
One more.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.856
Double or nothing.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.742
- Although,
it's your sauce now.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.160
- That's right.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.597
Good morning.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.059
Thank you.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.446
I can't believe how good
this all feels.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.406
- Yeah.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.328
It was a good idea
to come out here.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.205
It is so much better.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.623
- Thank you for being
understanding

06:13.706 --> 06:17.293
about me spending
so much time with Dad.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.836
- Yes.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.297
- Soon we'll figure out
how to reintroduce you two.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.341
We can say you underwent
some kind of

06:23.424 --> 06:26.886
psychological rehabilitation.

06:26.969 --> 06:30.056
Don't worry.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.392
He's gonna like you.

06:33.476 --> 06:38.314
- He doesn't suspect anything,
does he?

06:38.397 --> 06:39.816
- No.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.609
- No.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.238
- I think he's happy.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.159
I've been going through
Hazel's memories

06:50.243 --> 06:53.162
from before her chip
got uploaded.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.165
She and Herbert
were always fighting.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.002
We're not anymore.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.508
Oh, I was thinking.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.094
We should do some face time
with the employees today--

07:08.177 --> 07:10.263
make an appearance,
keep it up.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.890
- That's a great idea.
- Yes.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.351
Hello.
Hello.

07:15.434 --> 07:16.894
Sidney.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.022
- Mr. Gogol,
do you have a moment?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.440
I'd like to discuss
the results

07:21.524 --> 07:23.943
from our latest trials.
- Yes, I do.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.615
- Jay.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.492
- Huh.
Hello, Mrs. Gogol.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.452
How was--how was D.C.?

07:33.536 --> 07:35.037
- Great.
Thank you for asking.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.206
Byron and I had
a wonderful time.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.588
- What's going on?
Does he know?

07:43.671 --> 07:46.007
- What are you talking about?

07:46.090 --> 07:47.633
- Yes, what are you
talking about?

07:47.717 --> 07:50.011
Hi, how are you today?
- Um--

07:50.094 --> 07:52.680
I--I--I'm well, Mr. Gogol.
How are you?

07:52.763 --> 07:54.682
- Good.
- Good.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.476
- Mm-hmm, good work.
- Thank you.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.312
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.569
- Yeah, I--
I need to go back in there.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.238
Something doesn't feel right,
especially with Hazel.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.407
- We can't.
They're back from D.C.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.867
It's too dangerous.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.619
- Yeah, but I go alone.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.871
And you remember the tunnels
we didn't get to the ends of?

08:16.954 --> 08:19.415
Well, I have to see
where they lead to.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.459
- I'll echolocate
every ten minutes

08:21.542 --> 08:23.294
to keep tabs on you.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.004
Make sure you don't get lost.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.839
- Okay, all right.
Wish me luck.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.595
- I'm back.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.685
- Dad?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.315
Hey, you look really sharp.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.942
- Dad, what's going on?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.318
- Oh, I think the--

08:47.401 --> 08:49.737
stopping the treatments, it's--

08:49.820 --> 08:50.988
it's catching up with me.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.032
- Oh, I'll--

08:53.115 --> 08:54.325
- Haven't been feeling
so good.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.119
- I'll call
one of the doctors.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.288
- No. No, no, no. no.
Stay, stay.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.250
Yeah, I want to talk to you.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.795
Sit.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.137
All right.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.891
This might be very difficult
for you to understand,

09:18.975 --> 09:22.853
but, um, I never intended

09:22.937 --> 09:27.483
to get to this part of life.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.652
But then--then, you know,
you showed up

09:29.735 --> 09:34.782
at my doorstep
just out of the blue.

09:34.865 --> 09:38.452
And y--you really needed me.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.956
Yeah.
Then you brought me here.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.417
So I told myself,

09:44.500 --> 09:48.087
"Okay, change of plans.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.507
I've gotta hang on."

09:51.591 --> 09:55.011
Yeah, but then--then--
then these last few days...

09:56.762 --> 09:59.265
I mean, look at you.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.143
Hmm?
You seem good.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.437
So now, I--

10:04.520 --> 10:06.897
I think I can...

10:09.567 --> 10:15.197
I can finally
stop hanging on.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.533
- But you're not taking
your medications though.

10:17.616 --> 10:18.868
- Oh.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.286
- And you're not receiving
your treatment.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.746
- Yeah, but Byron--
- So that will--

10:21.829 --> 10:23.497
- Come on.
Who knows what Byron's up to?

10:23.581 --> 10:26.876
Huh?
Look what he did to you.

10:26.959 --> 10:30.212
- But our time together
is just getting started.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.548
- Yeah, I know.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.387
I know.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.556
I mean,

10:40.639 --> 10:42.933
it's supposed
to be bittersweet.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.853
I'm sorry, Hazel.
I just...

10:47.396 --> 10:51.359
I want to go out
when I'm on top,

10:51.442 --> 10:54.195
not when I hit bottom.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.739
Like Mom.

11:01.327 --> 11:05.414
- I can't imagine anything
worse than losing you.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.541
Except...

11:09.627 --> 11:12.421
Forcing you to stay for me.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.422
- Thank you.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.133
I want to do it

11:16.217 --> 11:19.595
just out under the open sky.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.597
Yeah.
The real sky.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.309
No--no fake Hub ceiling.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.896
Do you know how
to get out of here?

11:28.979 --> 11:32.525
- How about one more
camping trip together?

11:32.608 --> 11:34.527
- Yeah.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.321
- Where are you going?
- Water.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.489
- No!
Me first.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.741
- Herringbone.
- Yep.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.710
- Herringbone, are there, um,

11:51.794 --> 11:53.796
predators in this water
like crocodiles?

11:53.879 --> 11:56.340
- Crocodiles?

11:57.758 --> 11:59.802
- Who the fuck are you?

11:59.885 --> 12:01.387
- Can you get us out of here?

12:01.470 --> 12:02.680
- You up for a swim?

12:10.104 --> 12:12.148
- Truck's all packed.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.399
Ready, Diane?

12:13.482 --> 12:16.819
- Yeah, no.
Uh, she's gonna stay.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.487
- Really?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.281
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

12:20.364 --> 12:23.534
She doesn't need
to see me, um...

12:23.617 --> 12:27.329
Okay, I--I--
I'll meet you out there.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.789
- Okay.

12:57.443 --> 13:01.363
- You remember
the first day I got you?

13:01.447 --> 13:02.698
Huh?

13:02.781 --> 13:06.118
I mean, I didn't know
what to do with you.

13:08.412 --> 13:12.041
You were looking at me
like, uh...

13:12.124 --> 13:13.709
"Now what?"

13:15.711 --> 13:19.548
But, uh, we--

13:19.632 --> 13:22.801
we figured out
what to do, right?

13:26.764 --> 13:28.724
Yeah.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.937
But I, uh...

13:35.314 --> 13:39.610
I never anticipated

13:39.693 --> 13:42.738
what you would mean
to me, Diane.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.743
I never...

13:47.826 --> 13:51.038
felt alone 'cause of you.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.334
Never.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.838
So thank you.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.550
Thanks for, uh...

14:02.633 --> 14:05.094
for putting up with me.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.152
Yeah.

14:32.663 --> 14:36.083
You're still as beautiful
as the--the day I met you.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.427
- You're back!
Where have you been?

14:46.510 --> 14:48.887
Gosh.
Were you scuba diving?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.723
- I just need
a little privacy, okay?

14:50.806 --> 14:52.891
- Ja--Jasper,
what are you doing?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.393
Uncover me!

15:02.443 --> 15:04.361
- Before we go,
I have to stop by home first.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.654
- What?
No.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.156
- No, I'm not leaving
this place

15:07.239 --> 15:09.325
without the Nama-sake.
It's a one of a kind.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.993
It's the only thing
I have left from my wife.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.120
Please!
- Okay, okay.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.496
I need to get
my research too.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.040
And I've got
to check in on Zelda.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.250
- Okay, we'll meet at her tank
in 20 minutes?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.502
- Okay, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.672
- Oh, shit.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.341
Give me that.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.717
Quiet.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.347
- Why were Herringbone
and Fiffany in here?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.729
You can't just cover me up.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.148
My eyes and ears don't work
that way, Jasper.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.859
- Okay.
Sorry.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.402
I'm sorry.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.030
You said you're my plus one
in here though, right?

15:48.113 --> 15:51.367
You got me?
Anything I need?

15:51.450 --> 15:54.286
I need you to just trust me.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.288
Okay?
- I--I--

15:56.372 --> 15:59.041
I don't know what to do.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.960
My algorithm
isn't equipped for this.

16:02.044 --> 16:06.215
- I don't need you to do...
anything.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.883
Okay?

16:07.966 --> 16:11.845
Please?
Just--please?

16:15.849 --> 16:17.935
- Hello.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.354
- I'm going for a drive.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.231
- Sure thing, Mrs. Gogol.

16:22.314 --> 16:26.235
- Actually, you can start
calling me Ms. Green.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.075
- Stop!

16:35.160 --> 16:37.162
Stop!

16:37.246 --> 16:39.331
Stop!

16:45.629 --> 16:47.673
- Sir, you have your meeting
with the bioengineers

16:47.756 --> 16:50.050
in a few minutes.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.052
- We hire smart people.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.095
The best in the world, right?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.596
- Well, of course.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.057
- Yeah, they can handle it.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.435
You want to look
at the clouds?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.813
- In the hammock with you?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.857
- Yeah.
Plenty of room.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.029
- Good?

17:21.373 --> 17:22.833
- Truly relaxing.
- Very serene.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.293
- Yeah.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.759
Where'd you grow up, Bennett?

17:31.842 --> 17:34.636
- Well, when we step
inside the Hub,

17:34.720 --> 17:37.973
our pasts are considered
irrelevant data.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.311
- I did say that before.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.230
But I don't really
believe it anymore.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.736
- I'm from Lancaster,
Pennsylvania.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.822
- Ah.
- It's an Amish settlement.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.616
- You're Amish?

17:55.699 --> 17:58.911
- Yeah.
I mean, not anymore.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.998
- I bet growing up
without technology

18:03.081 --> 18:06.710
really gives you
a unique perspective

18:06.794 --> 18:08.212
on the Hub.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.218
Hmm.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.594
I'm ready for you
to get up now.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.138
- Oh, of course.
Sorry.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.224
- Thank you.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.354
I really appreciate you.
We're lucky to have you.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.386
- What do you think?

18:57.469 --> 19:00.347
- Wow.
Look at that view.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.893
Not a bad place to die.

19:04.977 --> 19:09.189
- Are you still sure
about this?

19:09.273 --> 19:13.277
- Yeah.
I'm sure.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.115
- So how do you want
to do this?

19:18.198 --> 19:19.575
Do you want me to push you
over the edge?

19:19.658 --> 19:22.828
Very funny.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.331
Nah, just go get the chairs.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.137
- Jasper.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.139
What are you still
doing here?

19:42.222 --> 19:43.473
Oh, no.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.766
Did Byron get to Fiffany?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.768
- No, no.
It's--it's all good.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.605
We're actually, uh,
getting ready to leave.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.273
Just wanted to say
goodbye again.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.441
For now.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.026
- Promise me
you'll make sure

19:54.109 --> 19:55.193
that Fiffany's okay
when she gets out

19:55.277 --> 19:56.612
into the real world.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.447
She's been in the Hub
for so long.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.450
It'll be a lot to acclimate
to normal life.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.660
She acts all tough,
but she's not.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.079
- I will.
I will.

20:07.497 --> 20:10.125
And, um, by the way, I'm--

20:10.208 --> 20:13.295
I'm gonna get you--
gonna get you out too--

20:13.378 --> 20:17.132
let you experience
that real ocean life.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.301
- I used to want that.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.262
But honestly,
what I want most now

20:22.346 --> 20:24.514
can't be found in the ocean.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.849
- Wh--what you mean?

20:25.933 --> 20:27.684
- I wasn't going
to say anything.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.062
But since
I'll never see you again,

20:30.145 --> 20:32.314
why the fuck not?

20:32.397 --> 20:35.984
I'm in love with you, Jasper.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.402
- I was--Zelda--

20:37.486 --> 20:39.655
- Please, don't say anything.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.950
It will hurt too much.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.952
Just go.

20:52.167 --> 20:56.171
- Um, I'ma...

20:56.254 --> 20:58.131
I'ma--
I'ma give you two a moment.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.008
And if, uh,
Herringbone's not here,

21:00.092 --> 21:02.260
we should go find him.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.604
Zelda.

21:18.276 --> 21:19.861
- Oh.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.141
What the hell?

21:52.060 --> 21:54.396
Frickin' Bennett.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.399
- Dr. Hau?
Doc?

21:59.401 --> 22:00.694
Dr. Hau!

22:00.777 --> 22:02.904
- Uh, she's not here.
- Can you get her for me?

22:02.988 --> 22:04.656
- No, I said she's not here.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.408
- Where is she?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.245
- Look, I--

22:10.328 --> 22:11.455
I'm not supposed
to know this,

22:11.538 --> 22:14.166
but I heard she lost it.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.584
She was saying weird stuff

22:15.667 --> 22:18.962
about Byron and Hazel's bodies?

22:19.046 --> 22:21.298
I don't know.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.509
She got put
in one of the solitary rooms.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.220
- Can you take me there?
- Yes.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.351
- Wow, Dr. Hau.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.437
- Bennett.
Oh, thank God.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.272
They took their bodies.
- Who?

22:37.355 --> 22:39.066
- Their consciousnesses.

22:39.149 --> 22:42.069
They used me
to get into their bodies.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.653
That's not Hazel or Byron.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.864
- I was thinking
the same thing.

22:45.947 --> 22:49.201
- We need to stop them.
We need to stop them--

22:49.284 --> 22:51.828
from whatever
they're about to do!

22:51.912 --> 22:53.955
- Can you fix what happened?

22:54.039 --> 22:57.125
- Yes. Yes, I can.
Just get me out of here.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.960
- No.
No!

23:01.129 --> 23:03.632
- Are you okay?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.258
- What have you done?

23:07.719 --> 23:10.472
- Does that feel okay?

23:10.555 --> 23:12.766
- Yeah.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.112
- What should I do
with Diane?

23:25.195 --> 23:27.322
- Oh, yeah.
I talked about it with her.

23:27.405 --> 23:31.618
And, um, we decided
that she should go to Bennett.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.789
Yeah.
I think he'll be good to her.

23:35.872 --> 23:39.501
Plus, I can tell
he's a virgin, so...

23:39.584 --> 23:42.963
she can teach him
a couple things.

23:50.428 --> 23:53.390
- What?

23:53.473 --> 23:55.517
- You know,
I look at you and I--

23:55.600 --> 23:58.061
I still see the little kid.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.565
Yeah.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.775
You were really annoying.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.945
I was annoying?

24:07.028 --> 24:09.114
- Yeah.
Always...

24:09.781 --> 24:13.034
Always with the,
"Dad, I'm bored."

24:13.118 --> 24:16.204
"Eh, Dad,
what should I do?"

24:16.955 --> 24:18.874
- I was bored.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.251
I had nothing to do.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.756
- I loved you so much
that it hurt.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.469
Still does.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.741
Ugh.
Ugh, disgusting.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.327
Ugh!

24:55.410 --> 24:56.953
- Herringbone,
we've been waiting for you.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.580
What are you doing?
- I couldn't find my book.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.582
Bennett moved all my shit.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.417
- Well, we can
help you find it.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.127
- No, no, I got it.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.254
But I got distracted by this.
Here.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.381
- Huh?
Oh.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.092
Wow.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.804
- Can we go?
- We can now.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.014
- Wait, "Namesake."

25:16.097 --> 25:17.390
- It's pronounced
"Name-sake."

25:17.474 --> 25:20.143
- It's "The Namesake"
by Jhumpa Lahiri.

25:20.227 --> 25:23.438
This is what you came back for?

25:23.521 --> 25:26.816
That's not an ancient text.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.610
That's a very popular book.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.654
- The--"The Namesake."
- Huh.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.280
- They made a movie of it.
It was pretty good.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.907
- Yeah, "The Namesake."
- Now that you're both

25:33.990 --> 25:37.535
just saying "namesake,"
that's all I can see.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.955
Why did Priya
leave this for me?

25:40.038 --> 25:42.290
- Lyle, it's
an Indian immigrant story

25:42.374 --> 25:44.042
about the struggles
of assimilation.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.294
She probably gave it to you
so that you could understand

25:46.378 --> 25:47.921
what she was feeling.

25:48.004 --> 25:50.131
You did say that
all her friends and family

25:50.215 --> 25:52.467
were in India.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.803
- Main character's name
is Gogol.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.764
I thought she was telling me
to work here.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.474
- Hey!

25:59.557 --> 26:01.017
- There he is,
the little rat.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.811
- I'll smother you
with a pillow.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.980
- No, jeez.
I'm--I'm happy you're here.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.481
Who do you think's
been keeping you alive

26:06.564 --> 26:08.775
in the pasture cube?

26:08.858 --> 26:10.277
- Okay, okay.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.699
- I really need your help.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.617
Jasper?
- Help for what?

26:17.701 --> 26:19.786
- It's Byron and Hazel.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.455
They're not themselves.
And I mean literally.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.751
- I see here
Byron's uploaded copies

26:26.835 --> 26:28.753
of his and Hazel's
consciousnesses

26:28.837 --> 26:30.714
to the Hub server
when they took the chips out.

26:30.797 --> 26:33.049
- Who cares?

26:33.133 --> 26:34.718
- Yeah, you said
Dr. Hau told you

26:34.801 --> 26:36.636
their consciousness
took over their bodies.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.805
So where are
Hazel and Byron right now?

26:38.888 --> 26:40.557
- Suppressed in their bodies.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.891
Eventually they'll disappear.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.351
- Okay.
All right, well, where are

26:43.435 --> 26:45.478
the fake Hazel and Byron
at this very moment?

26:45.562 --> 26:48.440
- He's been there.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.483
He's been watching
the clouds for hours.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.653
And then he hugged me.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.197
That's how I knew for sure
that it wasn't him.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.367
But I can't seem to find Hazel.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.161
- Okay,
this is a great story,

27:01.244 --> 27:02.912
but let's file it under
not my problem.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.664
Can we get out of here?
- Lyle.

27:04.748 --> 27:05.832
- What?

27:05.915 --> 27:07.542
After all that guy did to us?

27:07.625 --> 27:10.378
And after Hazel
had the chance to leave,

27:10.462 --> 27:11.755
and she just came back?

27:11.838 --> 27:13.214
Look, they deserve this.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.966
- She did it for her father.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.509
I know what it's like
to have your identity

27:16.593 --> 27:19.429
taken from you.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.639
Did Hazel know we were
in the pasture cube?

27:21.723 --> 27:24.059
- She doesn't even know
there is a pasture cube.

27:31.024 --> 27:35.445
- I can't leave
until we fix this.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.079
- I think I'm ready.

28:10.271 --> 28:13.024
My life, um...

28:13.108 --> 28:15.235
it's been--it's been
far from perfect.

28:15.318 --> 28:19.739
But this moment?

28:19.823 --> 28:21.991
Pretty close.

28:25.912 --> 28:29.457
Thank you for doing this
with me.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.586
Don't cry.

28:33.670 --> 28:37.257
I'm gonna see you
again someday.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.300
Mom and I.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.637
We're both gonna be
waiting for you.

28:42.720 --> 28:46.015
Don't come anytime soon,
though, okay?

28:46.099 --> 28:48.017
- Okay.

28:49.644 --> 28:51.479
- Just...

28:53.189 --> 28:55.650
Just trust your instincts.

28:55.733 --> 28:59.737
'Cause you got a good head
on your shoulders.

28:59.821 --> 29:02.532
You got a good future
ahead of you.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.828
- Okay.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.749
- I love you, Hazel.

29:17.505 --> 29:19.591
- I love you too, Dad.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.517
- Gonna close my eyes
for a little bit.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.580
- You can come get him now.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.720
- Dad!
