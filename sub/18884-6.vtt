WEBVTT

00:08.140 --> 00:11.800
Dude, that environmental film
we watched was a mind blower.

00:11.800 --> 00:12.500
I'm serious.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.900
When I say I feel bad for
people who haven't seen it.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.720
Oh, I feel so sorry for
the fools that aren't even

00:17.720 --> 00:19.640
intelligent enough
to follow along

00:19.640 --> 00:21.000
with an environmental film.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.790
I mean-- and I don't
want to get into it,

00:22.790 --> 00:24.530
but you know what it is--

00:24.530 --> 00:25.430
the educational system.

00:25.430 --> 00:27.200
And I don't want to get into it.
- I know.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.570
Yo, dudes, the food
truck outside, the guy

00:29.570 --> 00:30.780
dropped a corn
dog on the ground,

00:30.780 --> 00:32.640
and then he gave
it to me for free.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.400
And then he only charged
me $2 for the mustard.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.040
BLAKE: Come on, Adam, get
your head in the game.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.530
We are stocking up for
an imminent earthquake

00:39.530 --> 00:40.790
tsunami hear.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.320
Except earthquakes and
tsunamis aren't real.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.340
What is real is an
earthquake punani.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.440
It's a sex move that I made
up when you guys were watching

00:47.440 --> 00:49.180
dumb environmental films.
It goes like this.

00:49.180 --> 00:50.840
It comes.
Rolls in.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.560
Rolls in.
- Is that your penis?

00:52.560 --> 00:53.490
ADAM: Yeah, that's my penis.

00:53.490 --> 00:54.190
OK.

00:54.190 --> 00:56.400
ADAM: Now the whole
house is shaking.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.930
I'll chill for a second.

00:57.930 --> 00:58.970
After shock.
After shock.

00:58.970 --> 00:59.670
After shock.

00:59.670 --> 01:01.010
There's a private
moment for your life.

01:01.010 --> 01:02.090
Stop it.
- Aftershock.

01:02.090 --> 01:04.060
Educational system at work.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.970
- What education system, right?
- Exactly.

01:05.970 --> 01:06.830
My goodness.

01:06.830 --> 01:08.740
Hey, Adam, maybe, whoa--

01:08.740 --> 01:10.400
I'd be so good at sucking.
What's up?

01:10.400 --> 01:13.220
Adam, next time we're watching
an environmental film,

01:13.220 --> 01:14.850
you may want to come
into the room and--

01:14.850 --> 01:16.580
I don't know-- try
to follow along.

01:16.580 --> 01:19.810
That is, if you even
have the attention span.

01:19.810 --> 01:21.290
Watch this.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.220
Focus of a laser.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.090
Nothing will break this focus.

01:28.090 --> 01:29.050
Absolutely nothing.

01:29.050 --> 01:30.180
Who wants to
play hide and seek?

01:30.180 --> 01:31.070
OK.
I'll hide first.

01:31.070 --> 01:34.290
Close your eyes.
Do not look.

01:34.290 --> 01:35.830
- OK.
- Come on.

01:35.830 --> 01:36.700
All right.

01:36.700 --> 01:37.920
I saved the corn dog.

01:41.110 --> 01:44.260
THEME SONG: I'm fresh.

01:44.260 --> 01:45.130
You gotta.

01:45.130 --> 01:45.970
You gotta.

01:45.970 --> 01:47.570
You gotta be fresh.

01:50.930 --> 01:52.720
What do you need a new vest for?

01:52.720 --> 01:54.430
What, they're on sale.

01:54.430 --> 01:55.910
They mark it up
just to mark it down.

01:55.910 --> 01:56.840
You're still getting robbed.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.390
I'll try on anyway.

01:59.390 --> 02:00.820
Sh.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.180
I'm hiding.

02:02.180 --> 02:05.500
Of course, you are, buddy.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.490
My friend is coming.

02:07.490 --> 02:08.890
Just--
- OK.

02:08.890 --> 02:09.970
Take it easy.

02:09.970 --> 02:11.170
Jeez.

02:11.170 --> 02:14.980
Hey, owe, they outsmarted me.
ANDERS: Right.

02:14.980 --> 02:16.610
Yeah, we were definitely
still looking for you.

02:16.610 --> 02:17.650
Let's get out of here, man.
- Oh, yeah.

02:17.650 --> 02:18.880
Come on.
- I'm not going to go yet.

02:18.880 --> 02:19.820
OK?

02:19.820 --> 02:22.560
They freaking blew my cover,
so I'm going to hide again.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.530
Start counting.
Start counting.

02:24.530 --> 02:26.160
Adam, let's go, dude.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.090
Turn around.

02:27.090 --> 02:28.100
Do not look where I'm hiding.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.360
Sorry.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.960
Bless his heart.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.720
You guys look after him?

02:33.720 --> 02:34.900
I guess.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.510
I mean, he is a little
cuckoo, but you know.

02:37.510 --> 02:38.740
Yeah, cuckoos is
the way to put it.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.280
He's insane.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.460
He's like almost split
opened his head 100 times.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.790
His brain is like
scramby eggs up they're.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.490
It's bad.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.060
Not like we got to wipe
his butt or anything.

02:47.060 --> 02:49.180
Ah, actually, there were
the last three Super Bowls.

02:49.180 --> 02:49.880
Right.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.880
And every St. Patrick's
Day, a lot of green--

02:51.880 --> 02:53.520
well, anyway.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.170
LUKE: My name is Luke Fox,
and my associate, Mr. Barnes

02:56.170 --> 02:59.170
and I happen to be members
of a progressive think tank

02:59.170 --> 03:00.670
where we come up
with creative ways

03:00.670 --> 03:02.230
to help the less fortunate.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.630
Yeah, we do that
in our spare time.

03:03.630 --> 03:06.760
We're both CEOs of Fortune
500 companies by trade.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.200
Oh.

03:08.200 --> 03:08.940
Really?

03:08.940 --> 03:12.380
Every month, we select a
brain-damaged teen or adult

03:12.380 --> 03:14.510
to experience an
all-expenses-paid

03:14.510 --> 03:17.240
wilderness adventure at
our lodge in Big Bear.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.560
We'd like to invite you guys
and Adam to be our guests.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.260
LUKE: Yeah.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.790
And you better bring
your appetites because we

03:22.790 --> 03:24.160
eat breakfast for every meal.

03:24.160 --> 03:24.880
Yeah.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.740
We're in.

03:25.740 --> 03:26.540
We'd love to do that.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.030
That's really cool.
- Great.

03:28.030 --> 03:30.200
And I think it will be a
terrific experience for Adam

03:30.200 --> 03:31.610
to be exposed to nature.

03:31.610 --> 03:32.730
And that's--

03:32.730 --> 03:34.690
ADAM: [YELLING]

03:34.690 --> 03:35.480
Hey, Adam.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.430
Hey.

03:36.430 --> 03:38.420
How was the car ride?

03:38.420 --> 03:40.010
You see any animals?

03:40.010 --> 03:40.970
It's awesome.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.240
I thought I saw a raccoon,
but it was just a plastic bag.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.210
ANDERS: Sorry.

03:45.210 --> 03:46.910
We're late because we didn't
have any cell service,

03:46.910 --> 03:47.980
so we lost direction on the way.

03:47.980 --> 03:49.500
Oh, yes.
Sorry.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.480
No cell service.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.590
But you get used to it, and it
helps you unplug and unwind.

03:53.590 --> 03:54.290
Yeah.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.930
Let me have your car keys
in case I need to get out

03:56.930 --> 03:58.390
the driveway, go to the store.
- That's OK.

03:58.390 --> 03:59.680
Just let me know.
I'll move it.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.630
It's a little tricky.

04:00.630 --> 04:02.850
Easier if I have your keys.

04:02.850 --> 04:06.250
I might have to
take multiple trips.

04:06.250 --> 04:09.740
Hate to run out of pancake mix.

04:09.740 --> 04:10.620
Yeah.

04:10.620 --> 04:11.320
Yeah.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.290
You don't want to see him
when he runs out of mix.

04:13.290 --> 04:14.110
Don't want to see it.

04:14.110 --> 04:15.200
I don't want to see that.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.610
Give the man
your keys, Anders.

04:16.610 --> 04:17.060
OK.
All right.

04:17.060 --> 04:17.730
There you go.
Sorry.

04:17.730 --> 04:19.180
LUKE: Yeah.
Come on in.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.420
We're making breakfast.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.700
Cool.

04:21.700 --> 04:25.010
Hey, guys, just remember,
we're about to rub elbows

04:25.010 --> 04:27.950
with some fortune 500 brothers.
Behave.

04:27.950 --> 04:29.480
Give us some [INAUDIBLE].

04:29.480 --> 04:30.800
- Rubbing elbows.
- Give me the bow.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.760
- Rubbing elbows.
- Give me the bow.

04:31.760 --> 04:32.500
- Rubbing elbows.
- Give me the bow.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.900
Rubbing elbows.
Give me.

04:33.900 --> 04:34.850
Can we stop doing that?

04:34.850 --> 04:36.820
Unless you ask me to
do that, in which case,

04:36.820 --> 04:38.000
can I do that with you guys?

04:38.000 --> 04:38.990
Whoa.

04:38.990 --> 04:39.810
This is cool.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.610
ANDERS: Oh, my god,
look at those stairs.

04:41.610 --> 04:44.130
ADAM: Look at this stuff.

04:44.130 --> 04:49.460
And who is this gigantic
man taking pictures of me?

04:49.460 --> 04:53.960
Ah, I see you've met the
final guest for the weekend.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.640
Gentlemen, this is Jim Raines.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.390
Fresh meat.

04:57.390 --> 04:58.690
Huh.

04:58.690 --> 05:01.190
Fresh meat.

05:01.190 --> 05:02.270
He's fun.

05:02.270 --> 05:03.460
Is that your bathroom?

05:03.460 --> 05:04.300
I've got to tinkle.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.340
I've had like four sugar-free--

05:06.340 --> 05:07.230
Don't open that door!

05:07.230 --> 05:08.840
There's just a little
something in there

05:08.840 --> 05:11.150
that we're going to give you
at the end of the weekend,

05:11.150 --> 05:14.070
and we don't want to
spoil the surprise.

05:14.070 --> 05:15.410
I love surprises.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.610
Nearest bathroom
is right upstairs.

05:17.610 --> 05:18.570
OK.

05:18.570 --> 05:19.780
Time me.
Time me.

05:19.780 --> 05:21.250
Time me.
- All right.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.810
- Are you timing?
- I'm timing.

05:22.810 --> 05:23.990
Gentlemen, please.

05:23.990 --> 05:24.710
Absolutely.

05:24.710 --> 05:25.870
Please.

05:25.870 --> 05:26.630
Thank you.

05:26.630 --> 05:27.430
Very nice.

05:27.430 --> 05:29.950
This place looks like it
costs a billion dollars.

05:29.950 --> 05:31.490
How rich are you?
- OK.

05:31.490 --> 05:33.570
Anders, eat, baby.

05:33.570 --> 05:35.860
Don't be gouache.

05:35.860 --> 05:39.140
What he means is if there's
any secrets to success

05:39.140 --> 05:39.980
you can fill us in with.

05:39.980 --> 05:42.250
You know, business
or women wise.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.050
It is a guy's trip, after all.

05:44.050 --> 05:45.130
Sure.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.510
I have one.

05:46.510 --> 05:50.010
If opportunity doesn't
knock, build a door.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.010
ANDERS: Build a door.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.040
So you're saying
we should open

05:53.040 --> 05:54.700
like a doorstop or something?

05:54.700 --> 05:57.170
[LAUGHING]

06:00.130 --> 06:03.580
What?

06:03.580 --> 06:06.180
[INAUDIBLE] no.
Psych.

06:06.180 --> 06:08.190
[PHONE RINGS]

06:12.090 --> 06:13.460
Yeah.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.310
Yo.

06:15.310 --> 06:17.030
There are three of them.

06:17.030 --> 06:19.450
Listen, I can't talk right
now, but we might need

06:19.450 --> 06:21.080
more bullets in case they run.

06:24.530 --> 06:27.000
Everything OK?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.840
Everything is great.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.870
What was that
about the bullets?

06:30.870 --> 06:34.530
Sometimes Mr. Barnes
organizes hunting expeditions

06:34.530 --> 06:36.120
up here during the week.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.010
I'm sure the call was
about that, right?

06:39.010 --> 06:41.060
That's exactly what it was.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.830
ANDERS: Ah. yeah.
Makes sense.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.580
BARNES: Why don't you
go put your gear down

06:44.580 --> 06:45.960
while we prepare lunch.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.410
Don't you mean breakfast?

06:47.410 --> 06:48.240
You remembered.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.260
Of course, I did.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.060
I'm telling you guys
something's not right.

07:00.060 --> 07:00.980
Yeah, dude.

07:00.980 --> 07:01.820
I totally agree.

07:01.820 --> 07:03.200
You heard that guy
Barnes on the phone.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.270
He said something about
bullets, and then he

07:05.270 --> 07:07.430
mentioned three of them.

07:07.430 --> 07:09.390
ADAM: You're being ridiculous.

07:09.390 --> 07:11.540
That weird one probably just
huffed too much paint as a kid.

07:11.540 --> 07:12.710
It happens to the best of us.

07:12.710 --> 07:14.330
Something is
definitely up, and I

07:14.330 --> 07:15.830
think it has something
to do with that room

07:15.830 --> 07:17.140
they wouldn't let Adam into.
- Right.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.920
What was that?
- Dude, don't.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.820
No.

07:19.820 --> 07:20.520
I'm going downstairs.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.040
I'm going to snoop around.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.930
Adam, when are you
going to learn how to piss

07:24.930 --> 07:26.170
and talk at the same time?

07:26.170 --> 07:29.030
You know, honestly,
I don't know.

07:29.030 --> 07:31.600
It's been something that
I've been doing with like--

07:31.600 --> 07:33.740
oh, my god.
Dude, I'm doing it.

07:33.740 --> 07:34.700
Ders, do you hear it?

07:34.700 --> 07:36.380
I do hear it.
That's awesome, man.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.780
Good for you.

07:37.780 --> 07:39.890
LUKE: Should have
taken the call outside.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.200
You almost ruined
the whole weekend.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.140
Relax.

07:42.140 --> 07:45.360
They didn't know what
I was talking about.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.680
We got to water these
plants more often.

07:47.680 --> 07:48.550
They look dead.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.700
These new guns we got,
serious firepower.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.220
Probably blow their
heads clean off.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.510
Yeah?
Well, that won't be necessary.

07:59.510 --> 08:00.890
We kill the small one.

08:00.890 --> 08:01.600
That's it.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.570
RAINES: What about
the other two?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.040
Might as well.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.300
BARNES: If we have to.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.470
I'm going to get more
bullets in the garage.

08:08.470 --> 08:10.430
Oh, my god.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.170
Oh, my god.

08:22.170 --> 08:22.870
Oh.

08:35.220 --> 08:36.570
We have to get out of here.

08:36.570 --> 08:39.070
They're hunting us for sport.
- What?

08:39.070 --> 08:39.770
What?

08:39.770 --> 08:43.380
They've got guns,
and Adam is the target.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.600
And they'll kill us
too if they have to.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.680
That's why they invited us here.

08:46.680 --> 08:47.460
No, dude.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.750
They invited us to rub our
elbows and to groom us.

08:50.750 --> 08:51.960
Yeah, exactly.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.210
Their fortune 500 business
dudes, so why would

08:54.210 --> 08:57.000
they ever want to help some
non-fortune 500 business dudes?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.010
No.
No.

08:58.010 --> 08:59.140
Dude, they hunt the weak.

08:59.140 --> 09:00.040
They drink our blood.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.220
They live forever.

09:01.220 --> 09:02.180
It's pretty cool.

09:02.180 --> 09:03.990
500.

09:03.990 --> 09:06.160
Fortune 500.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.690
Oh, my god.

09:07.690 --> 09:09.660
It's years.

09:09.660 --> 09:11.310
They're vampires.

09:11.310 --> 09:13.530
Life is the greatest fortune.

09:13.530 --> 09:15.420
It's 500 years.

09:15.420 --> 09:18.370
You're right.

09:18.370 --> 09:19.350
OK.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.750
Well, I'm going to say
it's a misunderstanding

09:21.750 --> 09:23.420
and go get breakfast right now.
So--

09:23.420 --> 09:23.920
- OK.
- Adam.

09:23.920 --> 09:24.620
Adam.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.850
You go out there,
you're the breakfast.

09:26.850 --> 09:30.150
There were corpses, cadavers,
animals hanging everywhere

09:30.150 --> 09:31.980
and a little plaque
with your name on it

09:31.980 --> 09:33.980
where his head was
supposed to go.

09:33.980 --> 09:34.680
Oh, yeah.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.560
One other thing.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.010
A jar with a human
ding-dong in it, dude.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.570
So please stop being
stupid and listen to us.

09:41.570 --> 09:44.290
ADAM: Wait a second.

09:44.290 --> 09:46.460
How big was the ding-dong?

09:46.460 --> 09:47.990
Massive.

09:47.990 --> 09:49.630
Like five inches.
- My god.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.440
That is why they
chose me, right?

09:51.440 --> 09:53.570
Because mine is
almost that size.

09:53.570 --> 09:55.160
And then they took
your car keys, right?

09:55.160 --> 09:55.610
Oh, god.
Yes, they did.

09:55.610 --> 09:57.140
And I know my phone
doesn't have service.

09:57.140 --> 09:57.940
Does your phone service?

09:57.940 --> 09:58.730
None of our phones--

09:58.730 --> 09:59.780
My cell phone
doesn't have service.

09:59.780 --> 10:00.740
Does your cell
phone have service?

10:00.740 --> 10:01.460
Nope.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.230
ADAM: And you said your phone
doesn't have service, right?

10:03.230 --> 10:03.900
Phone doesn't work.

10:03.900 --> 10:04.910
Anders, is your cell
phone out of service?

10:04.910 --> 10:05.610
Out of batteries.

10:05.610 --> 10:07.130
And I said my phone
doesn't have service,

10:07.130 --> 10:07.850
so what should we do?

10:07.850 --> 10:08.880
We're going to get
the hell out of here.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.740
ANDERS: Yep.

10:09.740 --> 10:12.020
Out this window, man.
Come on.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.220
Let's get out of here.

10:13.220 --> 10:13.940
Come on!

10:13.940 --> 10:15.900
Great call, Ders.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.780
Just lift.
OK.

10:17.780 --> 10:18.610
Here we go.

10:18.610 --> 10:19.310
You, come here.

10:19.310 --> 10:20.650
Excellent.
OK.

10:20.650 --> 10:22.320
- That's the back of my nuts.
- OK.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.770
That's the front of my nuts.

10:23.770 --> 10:24.890
Remember that tree.

10:24.890 --> 10:25.700
That's our landmark.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.990
I definitely want a penis,
but I think I would want,

10:27.990 --> 10:29.780
like, both parts, you know?
- Dude.

10:29.780 --> 10:30.500
- Perfect.
- Yes.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.040
Yes.
- A body of water.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.730
- Yes.
- That's sick.

10:33.730 --> 10:34.920
Yes.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.460
That is perfect.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.930
Why is it perfect, though?

10:37.930 --> 10:38.730
What do you mean, dud?

10:38.730 --> 10:40.520
This is like survivalist 101.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.750
You get into the water.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.000
They can't track you, OK?

10:43.000 --> 10:43.700
You disappear.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.910
OK, but that water, it
looks disgusting, so I'm

10:46.910 --> 10:47.780
going to do my own thing.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.150
Adam, you've eaten
donuts out of a toilet.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.080
This water is fine.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.210
M-m, yeah.

10:53.210 --> 10:54.620
OK.

10:54.620 --> 10:55.840
Yeah, very soothing.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.140
It's like a spa day.

10:57.140 --> 10:59.180
We just take ourselves a trip
to Bed, Bath, and Body Works.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.680
M-hm.
For sample.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.570
Well, I'm going
to loop around,

11:02.570 --> 11:03.740
and I'll see you
on the other side.

11:03.740 --> 11:06.440
Enjoy getting water critters
climbing up your bean whole,

11:06.440 --> 11:07.280
OK?

11:07.280 --> 11:08.210
OK.

11:08.210 --> 11:08.910
All right.

11:08.910 --> 11:09.710
Whatever, Adumb.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.850
Good one.

11:11.850 --> 11:12.740
It's actually really cold.

11:16.890 --> 11:19.460
You sure there aren't
any three wolves out there?

11:19.460 --> 11:21.450
That's what the ranger
said on the phone.

11:21.450 --> 11:23.290
So the small one
might be rabbit.

11:23.290 --> 11:25.160
Jeesh.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.650
Oh, better keep that
to ourselves, guys, OK?

11:27.650 --> 11:28.530
Ah!

11:28.530 --> 11:30.740
There's something on my tongue.
- Stop.

11:30.740 --> 11:31.970
I told you not to
go under the water.

11:31.970 --> 11:33.240
What are you talking about?

11:33.240 --> 11:34.310
You've got leeches on your eyes.

11:34.310 --> 11:36.860
Ah!

11:36.860 --> 11:37.940
What did you do to me?

11:37.940 --> 11:41.640
ADAM: It was a beautiful walk.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.070
What happened to you too?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.650
Well, we just took a couple
of laps, just went swimming.

11:45.650 --> 11:46.530
Not a big deal.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.600
Why are you talking like that?

11:48.600 --> 11:51.470
Because Ders ripped
a leech off my tongue,

11:51.470 --> 11:52.560
and I think I'm catching a cold.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.160
And that's from the pond?
The leech?

11:54.160 --> 11:55.460
No.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.240
That had nothing to do with it.
Let's go.

11:57.240 --> 11:57.980
Guys?

11:57.980 --> 12:02.260
We've got pancakes.

12:02.260 --> 12:03.500
Guys?

12:03.500 --> 12:05.710
Oh, shit.

12:05.710 --> 12:06.720
ADAM: Whoa.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.420
Cool.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.340
Random house in the woods.

12:08.340 --> 12:09.440
Hey, Adam, no.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.690
Don't you get it?

12:10.690 --> 12:11.770
Nothing is random.

12:11.770 --> 12:13.000
This is all part of their plan.

12:13.000 --> 12:13.960
Yeah, man.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.380
You go into that cabin,
it is like suicide, dude.

12:17.380 --> 12:18.820
The floor, it opens up.

12:18.820 --> 12:21.200
You fall into a bed of spikes.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.720
You're dead fatality style.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.550
So just stay out
here and start a fire

12:24.550 --> 12:26.080
so we can get warm
while we think

12:26.080 --> 12:27.740
of a plan to get to safety.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.060
You got matches?

12:29.060 --> 12:29.860
You got matches on you?

12:29.860 --> 12:30.630
Check your wet pockets.

12:30.630 --> 12:31.650
BLAKE: Check the barrel.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.780
There's not going to be any
matches in the barrel of the--

12:34.780 --> 12:36.450
there are matches right here.

12:36.450 --> 12:40.460
Always check the
barrel of the firepit

12:40.460 --> 12:42.080
for matches to build a fire.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.470
That's like the first
place you should look.

12:44.470 --> 12:47.390
ADAM: Well, how come I
had to build the fire,

12:47.390 --> 12:49.080
and I can't come up with a plan?

12:49.080 --> 12:49.820
I can make plans.

12:49.820 --> 12:52.130
ANDERS: Because we just
watched an environmental

12:52.130 --> 12:55.360
film about surviving an
emergency, and you didn't.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.930
Did ya?
I don't think so.

12:56.930 --> 12:59.660
So just gather some kindling
and make a fire, if you

12:59.660 --> 13:00.970
even know what kindling is.

13:00.970 --> 13:02.100
Do you even know
what kindling is?

13:02.100 --> 13:03.530
Do you?

13:03.530 --> 13:07.100
Where I grew up,
it was little sticks.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.700
You're such an
idiot, Anders, Blake.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.600
You bitch asses.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.660
Fricking stupid--

13:14.660 --> 13:16.240
Oh, dude.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.090
What did the guy do in
the environmental flick?

13:18.090 --> 13:19.780
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

13:19.780 --> 13:21.670
He got to higher
ground so he could be

13:21.670 --> 13:22.980
spotted by the rescue copter.

13:22.980 --> 13:24.660
ANDERS: OK.
We'll do that.

13:29.800 --> 13:30.580
What are you doing?

13:30.580 --> 13:33.660
I found an ATV on
the side of the house.

13:33.660 --> 13:35.120
What?
Are you kidding me?

13:35.120 --> 13:35.880
That's great, man.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.160
Where did you find it.
Let's get on it.

13:37.160 --> 13:37.930
Let's get out of here.
- Hold on.

13:37.930 --> 13:38.830
I wasn't finished.

13:38.830 --> 13:41.070
And then I siphon all
the gas so I could

13:41.070 --> 13:42.550
start the fire more quickly.

13:42.550 --> 13:43.440
That was all the gas?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.440
ADAM: Yeah, it was most of it.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.440
I swallowed a lot of it.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.240
You buffoon.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.310
I think those guys were right.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.950
I think you do have
something medically wrong

13:49.950 --> 13:50.650
with your brain.

13:53.550 --> 13:55.740
- What are you talking about?
- Shall we tell him?

13:55.740 --> 13:59.310
Look, the reason
we're even on this trip

13:59.310 --> 14:03.880
is because those hunter guys
think you have brain damage.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.610
We didn't want to tell
you about it because we

14:05.610 --> 14:06.730
didn't want to ruin this trip.

14:06.730 --> 14:07.620
It's a nice, free weekend.

14:07.620 --> 14:08.510
You're dumb, dude.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.930
It's just what it is.

14:09.930 --> 14:13.150
You guys think that I've
been the dumb one of our group

14:13.150 --> 14:14.640
since the start and
end of our friendship?

14:14.640 --> 14:17.240
Yeah.
Since then.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.570
I guess this is goodbye.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.830
Hey, Adam, wait.

14:23.830 --> 14:27.560
I just wanted to say, psych.
Oh, my god.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.260
Keep walking, please.

14:28.260 --> 14:31.410
BLAKE: You're the bully, he's
the dummy, and I'm just cool,

14:31.410 --> 14:32.860
I guess.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.360
Oh, man.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.690
Speaking of cool, I have
a leech still on my dick.

14:38.690 --> 14:39.860
That's not cool.

14:39.860 --> 14:40.860
What do you mean?

14:40.860 --> 14:42.460
I'm getting my dick sucked.
- OK.

14:42.460 --> 14:43.930
All right.

14:43.930 --> 14:45.200
Maybe I'm the dumb one.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.770
Goodbye, former friends.

14:46.770 --> 14:48.540
Enjoy your environmental films.

14:48.540 --> 14:50.100
ANDERS: Adam, come on.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.350
There isn't any gas.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.730
I know that.

14:52.730 --> 14:56.850
I know there's no gas,
and I don't need any.

14:56.850 --> 14:58.320
He's crazy.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.500
[WOLF HOWLING]

15:17.960 --> 15:20.830
Do you hear that?

15:20.830 --> 15:23.920
We've got to find these
guys before the wolves do.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.620
Let's go.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.420
Listen.

15:30.420 --> 15:31.470
ATVs.

15:31.470 --> 15:32.960
It's just a joke to these guys.
Come on.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.090
We've got to get
to higher ground.

15:34.090 --> 15:35.700
No.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.070
Adam is our friend.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.660
If we don't fight
back, there's no way

15:38.660 --> 15:40.460
he's surviving this game.

15:40.460 --> 15:42.560
So are you with me?

15:42.560 --> 15:43.500
Fine.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.010
OK.
Predator shake?

15:45.010 --> 15:46.300
Yeah.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.000
That.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.570
Hey, what is that?

15:48.570 --> 15:50.000
I don't even know.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.300
Gave me the Beastmaster.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.860
- That's where I got that.
- Yeah.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.260
Credit off top.
- Yeah.

16:08.380 --> 16:09.380
OK.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.280
Here they come.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.320
Just hold on pants really tight.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.240
Pull.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.910
When we drive through, we
knock them off the ATVs.

16:14.910 --> 16:16.340
All right?
- Yeah.

16:16.340 --> 16:17.930
This is a really smart plan.

16:25.220 --> 16:27.160
What the heck was that?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.430
Ha, ha, ha.

16:34.430 --> 16:37.640
Yeah, looks Like
the script is flipped.

16:37.640 --> 16:38.340
That's right.

16:38.340 --> 16:40.590
Good luck hunting people
without any bullets, boys.

16:40.590 --> 16:42.830
How does this work?
Oh!

16:45.770 --> 16:48.220
Owe!

16:48.220 --> 16:49.900
It's OK.
Keep firing.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.310
- Owe!
- That really--

16:52.310 --> 16:53.690
Owe!

16:53.690 --> 16:55.690
I think that's it.

16:55.690 --> 16:56.620
That's not it.
All right.

16:56.620 --> 16:57.590
Yep.
I'm out.

16:57.590 --> 16:58.520
I'm all out.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.290
Back.
Back.

16:59.290 --> 16:59.990
Back.

16:59.990 --> 17:01.340
What the hell is
the matter with you?

17:01.340 --> 17:02.990
Oh, come on, man.
We're on to you.

17:02.990 --> 17:05.660
We know all about your
sick plan, hunting humans

17:05.660 --> 17:07.100
just because they're
not as smart as you.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.740
What are you talking
about, hunting people?

17:08.740 --> 17:09.440
Oh, come on.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.370
The gig is up.

17:10.370 --> 17:13.520
I heard you on the phone saying,
the little one is the target.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.230
And then I saw that plaque
with Adam's name on it

17:15.230 --> 17:17.690
where his severed head
was supposed to go.

17:17.690 --> 17:22.040
We were hunting
wolves to protect you.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.930
There were three sighted
around here, and one of them

17:23.930 --> 17:24.740
might be rabid.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.170
The plaque is for his picture.

17:27.170 --> 17:28.740
We make one for
every guest of honor.

17:28.740 --> 17:29.720
OK.
OK.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.420
OK.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.650
So even if this way more
plausible explanation is true,

17:33.650 --> 17:35.000
what's with this guy here?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.230
He has a brain injury
from concussions.

17:38.230 --> 17:39.980
He was the first
guest of honor here.

17:39.980 --> 17:44.560
Ever since I was in the XFL,
I've been in constant pain.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.260
I'm sorry.

17:45.260 --> 17:47.540
Did you just say
you were in the XFL?

17:47.540 --> 17:48.740
Oh, my god.

17:48.740 --> 17:51.020
The XFL is legendary, man.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.760
Oh, did you know He Hate Me?

17:52.760 --> 17:53.870
Did he like you?

17:53.870 --> 17:54.950
Will he like me?

17:54.950 --> 18:00.500
he Hate Me, love me,
but the point is my life

18:00.500 --> 18:02.300
has been a constant torment.

18:02.300 --> 18:03.320
What team were you on?

18:03.320 --> 18:05.120
Where you with the
Outlaws or were you--

18:05.120 --> 18:05.930
Maniacs.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.430
You were on the Maniacs.
I recognize you.

18:07.430 --> 18:08.160
You are a Maniac.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.200
Wolves.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.080
You were on the Wolves.
OK.

18:11.080 --> 18:11.980
A man respects.

18:11.980 --> 18:13.560
Not necessarily the Maniacs.
They were cool.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.360
Where was that?
Duluth?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.070
BLAKE: No, I think that
they were from Washington.

18:16.070 --> 18:17.600
No.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.680
Actual wolves.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.040
Look behind you, you morons.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.540
Oh.

18:21.540 --> 18:23.600
ANDERS: No, I don't
want to die, man.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.300
I never got to be Dead
Pool for Halloween.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.480
I was never in a threesome,
at least one that I

18:28.480 --> 18:29.480
was allowed to participate in.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.180
Yah!

18:30.180 --> 18:33.990
Ders, you can still have
your threesome, my man.

18:33.990 --> 18:36.620
And Blake, you'll get to do
the thing that you want to do,

18:36.620 --> 18:38.900
even though I was too far away
to hear exactly what that was.

18:38.900 --> 18:39.740
Here kitty.

18:39.740 --> 18:40.580
Here kitty, kitty, kitty.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.390
Adam, where did you
get the flair, man?

18:42.390 --> 18:43.670
I got it from the cabin.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.710
I took a shower, and I
also ate some peaches,

18:45.710 --> 18:47.810
but while I was eating
those peaches, I thought,

18:47.810 --> 18:50.800
there's no way that
I can let my friends

18:50.800 --> 18:54.820
be killed by these freaking
murderous, villainous business

18:54.820 --> 18:56.090
men.

18:56.090 --> 18:59.460
Because not saving your
friends, that really is stupid.

18:59.460 --> 19:00.400
ANDERS: Right.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.590
So not actually killer
business, dudes.

19:02.590 --> 19:03.740
We didn't know.
He didn't know.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.340
Come on, man.
Throw the flair at the wolves.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.960
Make them go away.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.370
Adam.

19:09.370 --> 19:10.720
Adam, what are you doing?

19:10.720 --> 19:12.200
Do not be stupid, OK?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.390
Just listen to the
intelligent people for once.

19:14.390 --> 19:17.660
There are different kinds
of intelligence, Anders.

19:17.660 --> 19:19.560
There's
environmental-film-watching

19:19.560 --> 19:24.850
intelligence, there's
artificial intelligence,

19:24.850 --> 19:26.290
and there's the
kind of intelligence

19:26.290 --> 19:28.300
that I have that
knowing that when

19:28.300 --> 19:34.750
you swallow a bunch of gasoline,
it'll turn poop into fireballs.

19:34.750 --> 19:35.740
Intelligence.

19:40.490 --> 19:41.770
Oh, it's worse coming back up.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.240
It's OK, little kitty.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.550
ANDERS: Awesome!

19:56.550 --> 19:57.950
It worked!

19:57.950 --> 19:59.220
The wolves started running away!

20:07.080 --> 20:08.450
We lied about Adam.

20:08.450 --> 20:11.980
He Doesn't actually have
any kind of brain problems,

20:11.980 --> 20:14.410
but we wanted a free trip.

20:14.410 --> 20:17.240
So he's obviously not even
the dumbest guy in our group.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.070
There is no dumb
one in your group,

20:19.070 --> 20:21.440
because you're all
equal fucking idiots.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.010
If we don't contain this fire,
the whole forest could burn.

20:24.010 --> 20:25.070
Wait.

20:25.070 --> 20:27.740
What about that human
penis I found in the jar.

20:27.740 --> 20:30.990
Oh, sh.

20:30.990 --> 20:33.570
Guys, I have too much money, OK?

20:33.570 --> 20:35.150
And with the internet,
forget about it.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.170
So save drive, OK?

20:37.170 --> 20:39.320
And that's a weird place, man.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.980
I guess if I had like a billion
dollars, I might want a dick.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.800
Hey, I think I know what we
could watch on the way home.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.330
I still have it on my phone.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.170
- The environmental film?
- M-hm.

20:49.170 --> 20:50.700
That would be awesome, dude.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.370
Dude, if you like
"Central Intelligence,"

20:52.370 --> 20:53.270
you'll love this movie.

20:53.270 --> 20:54.440
It's got Dwayne
"The Rock" Johnson.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.840
He's a mogul.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.590
What's it called?

20:57.590 --> 21:01.360
"Sand and Rayeth."

21:01.360 --> 21:02.450
I didn't understand.

21:02.450 --> 21:03.700
What did he say?
- "San Andreas."

21:03.700 --> 21:04.520
Oh.
OK.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.610
Cool.
- Yeah.

21:06.610 --> 21:08.270
- Night.
- Nice.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.430
Footprints, Adam.

21:14.430 --> 21:15.290
OK.

21:15.290 --> 21:17.750
Ah, don't we think that this
is just wasting precious time,

21:17.750 --> 21:20.300
that we should keep going?

21:20.300 --> 21:22.120
OK.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.280
Do you want to live,
or do you want to die?

21:24.280 --> 21:25.240
Quick test.

21:25.240 --> 21:25.970
I want to live.

21:25.970 --> 21:26.670
All right.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.730
Let's start acting like it, OK?
