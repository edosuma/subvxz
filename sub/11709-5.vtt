HOW TO EXPLAIN IT.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.765
{\an8}I JUST SAW ROGER DOING HIS LIKE,
"COME ON" TO SOMEONE.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.684
{\an8}- WOOF.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.395
{\an8}- SO I TELL HIM TO STOP.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.897
{\an8}THROWS ME ACROSS THE CLUB.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.190
{\an8}- NO.
- I GET UP.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.818
{\an8}ONE OF THEM HELP, I GET UP,

07:23.901 --> 07:25.486
{\an8}I THROW A DRINK IN HIS FACE,
BAMBOO BOUNCERS TAKE HIM OUT.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.030
{\an8}LIKE, "ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?
ALMO--

07:28.114 --> 07:29.073
{\an8}YOU ALMOST HIT ME."

07:29.157 --> 07:30.241
{\an8}- SHUT UP.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.034
{\an8}- I CHASE HIM
DOWN THE FUCKING STREET,

07:32.118 --> 07:33.035
{\an8}HE GOES, "FUCK YOU.
YOU TRYING TO ACT

07:33.119 --> 07:34.704
{\an8}LIKE YOU FIGHT
LIKE A FUCKING DUDE."

07:34.787 --> 07:36.247
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, "NO, I WAS
JUST TRYING TO STOP YOU."

07:36.330 --> 07:37.707
{\an8}HE WAS LIKE,
"GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE."

07:37.790 --> 07:39.834
{\an8}HE BOUNCED.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.212
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
- MM-HMM. I'M PISSED.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.506
{\an8}I CAN'T GO OUT TONIGHT
IF MY FOOT'S LIKE THIS.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.468
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO GO CHECK THAT OUT?
- YES.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.387
{\an8}- SO LET'S GO
TO THE DOCTOR.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.973
{\an8}- LAST NIGHT, I FEEL LIKE
I TOOK A HARD FALL

07:54.056 --> 07:56.601
{\an8}AND MY ANKLE
STILL FUCKING HURTS.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.061
{\an8}LIKE, THIS HURTS, SO I NEED
TO GO GET IT CHECKED OUT.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.147
{\an8}- YOU GONNA CALL HIM?
OR...

08:01.230 --> 08:02.732
{\an8}HE'S NOT GONNA CALL YOU,
PROBABLY.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.234
{\an8}- SO MEAN. LIKE, I FEEL LIKE
HE SHOULD, ON SOME LEVEL,

08:05.318 --> 08:06.360
{\an8}APOLOGIZE.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.987
{\an8}I TRIED TO APOLOGIZE--
- MAYBE 'CAUSE

08:08.070 --> 08:09.530
{\an8}THE ADRENALINE,
IT JUST WASN'T HAPPENING.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.700
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT TODAY.
- WELL, YEAH, TODAY.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.243
{\an8}- HE DIDN'T CALL,
HE DIDN'T ANYTHING.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.412
{\an8}- BUT STILL--

08:16.495 --> 08:17.705
{\an8}- I'M PRETTY ANGRY
AT ROGER RIGHT NOW.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.415
{\an8}I'M NOT ANGRY
WITH THE ACTUAL FIGHT.

08:19.498 --> 08:22.668
{\an8}I'M ANGRY, LIKE, HE PUSHED ME
AWAY AFTER THE FIGHT.

08:22.752 --> 08:27.006
{\an8}LIKE, THAT'S WHAT HURTS ME
THE MOST RIGHT NOW.

08:27.089 --> 08:27.924
{\an8}- YOU WANNA GO TO THE BEACH
OR DO YOU WANNA GO TO THE GYM?

08:28.007 --> 08:29.300
{\an8}- GYM.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.385
{\an8}- LET'S--LET'S GO.
I'M READY TO GO.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.097
{\an8}TODAY, I FEEL LIKE
COMPLETE SHIT FROM LAST NIGHT,

08:35.181 --> 08:36.432
{\an8}SO I'M LIKE,
"LET'S GO TO THE GYM

08:36.515 --> 08:37.140
{\an8}SO I CAN WORK THIS OFF."

08:37.225 --> 08:39.852
{\an8}IS ROGER MAD AT JENNI?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.229
{\an8}- YEAH.
- WHY?

08:41.312 --> 08:42.270
{\an8}- 'CAUSE SHE
SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.732
{\an8}- ROGER'S A 37-YEAR-OLD MAN.

08:44.815 --> 08:45.942
{\an8}LIKE, SHE DOESN'T
WANT HIM FIGHTING,

08:46.025 --> 08:46.984
{\an8}SO SHE FELT LIKE
SHE WOULD PROTECT HIM.

08:47.068 --> 08:47.944
{\an8}THAT'S HOW IT--

08:48.027 --> 08:49.320
{\an8}THAT'S HOW
OUR MENTALITY IS.

08:49.403 --> 08:50.947
{\an8}- YOU GUYS THINK 'CAUSE YOU GUYS
CAN SCRAP WITH EACH OTHER,

08:51.030 --> 08:53.991
{\an8}AND YOU GIR--LIKE, YOU GET
PUNCHED IN THE FACE BY A DUDE,

08:54.075 --> 08:57.745
{\an8}YOU--YOU'RE DONE.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.414
{\an8}VERY RARE, IN THIS WORLD,
CAN ANY GIRL

09:00.498 --> 09:02.708
{\an8}PROTECT A GUY IN A FIGHT.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.962
{\an8}SO I'M TAKING ROGER'S SIDE
BECAUSE WHEN A FIGHT BREAKS OUT,

09:06.045 --> 09:07.588
{\an8}I BELIEVE A GIRL SHOULD BE
NOWHERE NEAR THE FIGHT.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.132
{\an8}- I GET IT,
WE SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING

09:10.216 --> 09:11.133
{\an8}IN ANY GUY FIGHT
WHATSOEVER.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.260
{\an8}IT'S NOT RIGHT.
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.803
{\an8}BUT IT'S AN INSTINCT.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.888
{\an8}I DON'T THINK, LIKE,
ROGER AND RON UNDERSTAND.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.348
{\an8}LIKE, WOMEN HAVE

09:17.431 --> 09:19.684
{\an8}THAT SAME URGE TO PROTECT
SOMEONE THEY CARE ABOUT.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.811
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT BE,
LIKE, THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES

09:21.894 --> 09:25.564
{\an8}OR ANY RIGHT SITUATION DEALING
WITH A MEN'S FIGHT,

09:25.648 --> 09:26.607
{\an8}IT'S JUST WE HAVE
THE SAME INSTINCT.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.484
{\an8}- I KNOW YOU GUYS
JUST WANT TO PROTECT US.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.653
{\an8}YOU DON'T WANT NOTHING
TO HAPPEN TO US,

09:30.736 --> 09:31.946
{\an8}BUT THAT WE DON'T WANT NOTHING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.531
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHY WE GET MAD
WHEN YOU GET INVOLVED.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.950
{\an8}- I'M LIKE,
"WHAT ARE WE DOING?"

09:36.033 --> 09:37.326
{\an8}WE'RE, LIKE, FIGHTING
OVER SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEMS.

09:37.410 --> 09:41.330
{\an8}THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S,
LIKE, SHIT'S MESSED UP.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.541
{\an8}STOP FIGHTING WITH ME.
I'M TELLING YOU I LOVE YOU.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.210
{\an8}- [laughs] YOU'RE
THE ONE THAT--I DON'T KNOW.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.174
{\an8}- UGH, I CAN'T GET OUT.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.592
{\an8}[groans]

09:53.676 --> 09:55.511
{\an8}YOU LOOK LIKE ME.

{\an8}IN SLIPPERS,
HUNG OVER, BEAT UP.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.184
{\an8}- YEAH.
- GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.477
{\an8}I'M WORRIED ABOUT JENNI

10:03.561 --> 10:04.103
{\an8}BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S SAYING HER ANKLE HURTS.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.188
{\an8}AND I KNOW JENNI.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.232
{\an8}SHE CAN BE
A LITTLE DRAMATIC SOMETIMES.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.109
{\an8}BUT, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S BEEN TAKING CARE OF ME

10:10.192 --> 10:11.527
{\an8}FOR, LIKE, FOUR YEARS NOW,

10:11.610 --> 10:13.863
{\an8}AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY TIME
TO TAKE CARE OF JENNI.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.073
{\an8}- ANY DISCOMFORT WHEN I PULL?
- OH, YEAH.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.199
{\an8}- THAT HURTS, OKAY.
HOW ABOUT WHEN I PULL BACK?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.367
{\an8}- YUP.
- GOOD.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.037
{\an8}ANY PAIN WHEN I EVERT?

10:21.120 --> 10:23.331
{\an8}- UH-HUH!
- I'M SORRY.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.582
{\an8}SO, JENNI, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE A LOT OF TENDERNESS

10:24.665 --> 10:29.670
{\an8}IN THE MIDDLE PART
OF YOUR ANKLE AREA.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.881
{\an8}AND WITH THAT, YOU KNOW,
INFLAMMATION THERE,

10:31.964 --> 10:33.674
{\an8}I WANT TO GET AN X-RAY TO MAKE
SURE YOU DON'T HAVE A FRACTURE.

10:33.758 --> 10:34.800
{\an8}OKAY?
- OKAY.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.385
{\an8}- THE NURSE IS GONNA COME IN
AND GET YOU

10:36.469 --> 10:38.220
{\an8}AND DO AN X-RAY, AND THEN
I'LL DO A WET READ RIGHT NOW.

10:38.304 --> 10:38.846
{\an8}ALL RIGHT.
- THANK YOU.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.473
{\an8}- SURE, NO PROBLEM.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.307
{\an8}I'LL BE BACK TO TELL YOU
WHAT THE X-RAY SHOWS

10:41.390 --> 10:42.892
{\an8}IN A COUPLE MINUTES,
OKAY?

10:42.975 --> 10:45.394
{\an8}- JENNI HAS TO GET AN X-RAY,

10:45.478 --> 10:47.772
{\an8}UM, YOU KNOW, TO SEE
IF SHE BROKE HER ANKLE.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.899
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY,
I WANT HER TO BE FINE,

10:49.982 --> 10:52.610

THREE PICTURES OF YOUR ANKLE.

FROM THIS RADIATION ROOM.

{\an8}THERE'S EVIDENCE OF WHAT'S
CALLED A NAVICULAR FRACTURE.

{\an8}- CAN YOU WRITE DOWN
WHAT BONE I FRACTURED?

14:06.512 --> 14:07.555
{\an8}- [laughs]

14:07.638 --> 14:08.764
{\an8}- COOL.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.599
{\an8}MY SUMMER IN SEASIDE
IN CRUTCHES.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.519
{\an8}- WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
IN THEM THE WHOLE TIME.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.105
{\an8}- I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE
TO NEED SURGERY.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.066
{\an8}- I DOUBT IT.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.569
{\an8}I WONDER
HOW LONG THIS WILL--

14:21.652 --> 14:22.570
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO HAVE IT ON.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.364
{\an8}- NOW I'M DEFINITELY
NOT CALLING HIM.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.949
{\an8}I'M PISSED.
[laughs]

14:27.032 --> 14:28.200
{\an8}I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE
THE FACT

14:28.284 --> 14:29.285
{\an8}THAT IT'S ROGER'S FAULT
THIS HAPPENED,

14:29.368 --> 14:31.537
{\an8}AND I'M THE ONE
THAT'S IN CRUTCHES.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.789
{\an8}- MAKE SURE
YOU ELEVATE IT AND ICE IT.

14:33.872 --> 14:36.292
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
- NO HIGH-HEELED SHOES,

14:36.375 --> 14:37.501
{\an8}AND REALLY TRY TO LIMIT
WEIGHT-BEARING.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.502
{\an8}DON'T WALK ON IT, OKAY?

14:38.586 --> 14:39.753
{\an8}TRY TO USE YOUR CRUTCHES

14:39.837 --> 14:41.297
{\an8}AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
UNTIL YOU SEE THE ORTHOPEDIST.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.090
{\an8}- HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL BE HANDICAPPED FOR?

14:43.173 --> 14:46.260
{\an8}- YEAH, SO MOST FRACTURES
TAKE BETWEEN FOUR AND SIX WEEKS.

14:46.343 --> 14:49.305
{\an8}- OOH! YOUR SUMMER'S OVER.
WHOO-HOO!

14:49.388 --> 14:51.223
{\an8}- YEAH, I'M SORRY.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.563
{\an8}- MY ARMPITS ALREADY HURT.
- [laughs]

14:57.646 --> 14:59.690
{\an8}- FUCK MY LIFE.
- THIS IS AWESOME!

14:59.773 --> 15:03.444
{\an8}- I HATE YOU.
- [chuckles]

15:07.740 --> 15:09.491
{\an8}- HE SAID JENNI BLEW UP
THE BATHROOM THIS MORNING.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.284
{\an8}- OH, BRO.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.286
{\an8}VIN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA, BRO.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.121
{\an8}I THOUGHT I SHIT IN THERE.
- THAT'S SO GROSS.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.831
{\an8}- I WILL SAY THAT I FELT BAD
FOR ROGER LAST NIGHT.

15:15.914 --> 15:17.625
{\an8}I DON'T THINK JENNI
WAS TOO NICE.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.751
{\an8}- I HAD
THIS CONVERSATION WITH SAMMI.

15:18.834 --> 15:19.918
{\an8}ME AND SAM ALMOST
GOT INTO A FIGHT OVER IT.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.129
{\an8}- FROM A GUY'S
POINT OF VIEW, LIKE,

15:22.212 --> 15:23.672
{\an8}SHE THREW A DRINK ON HER MAN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.424
{\an8}- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT, BRO?
WHEN THE TWO GUYS ARE FIGHTING,

15:25.507 --> 15:27.760
{\an8}YOU DON'T GET INVOLVED.
- I CAN'T AGREE MORE.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.971
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE IF IT'S INSTINCT,
YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR MAN...

15:31.055 --> 15:32.640
{\an8}- YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.
- YOU'RE--

15:32.723 --> 15:33.974
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA GET FUCKING HURT.
- JENNI WENT TO THE HOSPITAL.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.809
{\an8}- JENNI THINKS
THAT ROGER PUSHED HER

15:35.893 --> 15:36.935
{\an8}AND TRIED TO SWING AT HER

15:37.019 --> 15:39.188
{\an8}WHEN THAT--
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.564
{\an8}- YO, NOT FOR NOTHING.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.857
{\an8}SHE'S BEEN GONE ALL DAY.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.817
{\an8}- YOU KNOW
SHE'S GONNA MILK IT.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.069
{\an8}- WATCH HER COME BACK
WITH A CAST, YO.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.487
{\an8}SHE GETS AN INJURY
EVERY YEAR.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.863
{\an8}- YEAH.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.948
{\an8}[laughs]

15:50.032 --> 15:51.408
{\an8}- JENNI DEFINITELY
IS THE GIRL THAT CRIES WOLF.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.536
{\an8}SHE OVERPLAYS EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW?

15:54.620 --> 15:57.998
{\an8}A BURNT HAND,
HURT ANKLE.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.166
{\an8}LIKE, ALL SHE DOES
IS REALLY BITCH.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.251
{\an8}SHE SHOULD'VE WENT
TO BITCHING UNIVERSITY

16:01.335 --> 16:04.380
{\an8}AND GRADUATED
WITH A BITCH-ACHELOR'S DEGREE.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.507
{\an8}[chuckles]

16:06.590 --> 16:08.258
{\an8}- GOING OUT?
- LET'S GO.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.720
{\an8}- ARE WE TAKING
THE BOARDWALK OR THE STREET?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.597
{\an8}- THIS SUCKS.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.350
{\an8}- EW, IT SMELLS
LIKE VAGINA.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.559
{\an8}HELLO?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.561
{\an8}- WHERE THE HELL
WERE YOU GUYS ALL DAY?

16:19.645 --> 16:20.646
{\an8}- DOCTOR.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.147
{\an8}THIS IS REALLY A BUMMER
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

16:22.231 --> 16:25.192
{\an8}I CAN'T GO TO THE CLUB
AND WEAR HEELS.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.902
{\an8}I CAN'T GO TO THE GYM.
I'M GONNA GET FAT.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.780
{\an8}I CAN'T WALK
DOWN THE BOARDWALK.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.156
{\an8}I CAN'T WORK
AT THE T-SHIRT SHOP.

16:31.240 --> 16:36.120
{\an8}LIKE, EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW
AS A HUMAN BEING WITH TWO FEET

16:36.203 --> 16:37.329
{\an8}HAS COME TO AN END.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.248
{\an8}- ARE YOU GONNA BRING
THE CRUTCH TO KARMA?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.582
{\an8}- I HAVE TO BE IN A CAST
FOR FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.418
{\an8}- SHE HAS TO.
- I FEEL TERRIBLE. THAT SUCKS.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.877
{\an8}I WOULD HATE--UGH.
- YEAH.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.587
{\an8}- HEY, GIRL.
- HI.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.005
{\an8}JENNI, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.216
{\an8}- UGH.
- LOOK.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.342
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.760
{\an8}- JUST GUESS
WHAT HAPPENED, LIKE...

16:51.844 --> 16:53.512
{\an8}- DID YOU BREAK IT?
BROKE "LIMB-AMENTS"?

16:53.595 --> 16:56.140
{\an8}- CHIPPED A BONE.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.683
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

16:57.766 --> 16:58.809
{\an8}- SO SHE'S ON IT--

16:58.892 --> 17:00.853
{\an8}SHE'S ON CRUTCHES
FOR FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.688
{\an8}- SHE HAS TO WEAR,
LIKE, A CAST.

17:02.771 --> 17:03.939
{\an8}NOW IT'S TO ANOTHER LEVEL.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.398
{\an8}I'M LIKE, NOW, LIKE, YOU--

17:05.482 --> 17:07.776
{\an8}LIKE, IF--IF ROGER DID ANYTHING,
AND HE HURT YOU TO A POINT

17:07.859 --> 17:10.279
{\an8}WHERE YOU FRACTURED YOUR FOOT,
LIKE, THAT'S KIND OF MESSED UP.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.696
{\an8}I WOULD, LIKE,
BE FREAKING OUT.

17:11.780 --> 17:12.740
{\an8}- I AM.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.157
{\an8}- SO YOU'RE FUCKED.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.325
{\an8}- SHE CAN'T WORK OUT
OR ANYTHING.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.952
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD,
WHAT A FUCKING MESS, J.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.912
{\an8}I'M ACTUALLY SHOCKED
THAT, YOU KNOW,

17:18.996 --> 17:21.290
{\an8}JENNI ACTUALLY
FRACTURED HER ANKLE

17:21.373 --> 17:25.877
{\an8}'CAUSE I WASN'T SURE IF SHE
WAS JUST BEING DRAMATIC.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.220
{\an8}- HEY, GIRLS.
- HEY, GUYS.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.430
{\an8}- JENNI'S COMING OUT

17:38.891 --> 17:40.809
{\an8}- HER LEG'S BROKE.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.977
{\an8}- RON, YOU LOOK

17:42.060 --> 17:43.103

{\an8}- WOW.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.017

{\an8}- SHE'S BY HERSELF.
SHE'S GOTTA COME BACK.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.204
