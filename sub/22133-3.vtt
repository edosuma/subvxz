19:29.900 --> 19:32.730
brought it up

19:32.730 --> 19:35.720
all right Kari

19:35.720 --> 19:38.720
Carrie this is basic I know

19:39.279 --> 19:43.660
love this book now back to get off my
boat

19:51.759 --> 19:52.490
that

19:52.490 --> 19:55.490
yeah

20:11.480 --> 20:14.900
but he eventually came back to us

20:14.900 --> 20:18.590
the boy was under water that long and
you still brought him back

20:19.400 --> 20:24.620
you know you never give up I love war
stories but let's get down to why we're

20:24.619 --> 20:25.279
here

20:25.279 --> 20:28.849
Erica I was thinking that we'd give you
sign it outside the center

20:28.849 --> 20:32.929
maybe even pass out samples of the
towers fast blocks on screen will eat

20:32.930 --> 20:36.860
that up for a fee up front and fifty
percent of the return that yields and

20:36.859 --> 20:39.919
fifty percent is Steve and how do we
measure the source of the return

20:39.920 --> 20:45.590
hey you like what we do I'm not looking
to make a killing Erica I just want to

20:45.589 --> 20:48.589
keep my Center going

20:50.690 --> 20:54.140
a year deal with the monthly payment
schedule I perfect quarterly

20:54.769 --> 20:58.099
ok kamiya cut through the numbers bowl
here

20:58.099 --> 21:02.539
my Center trains lifeguards to be the
best that's what I do I'm not a money

21:02.539 --> 21:04.490
guy I'm not looking to get rich

21:04.490 --> 21:08.900
I just want to keep the water safe for
you friends your friends kids

21:08.900 --> 21:11.900
so you tell me how much you want to pay
for it

21:12.579 --> 21:19.178
your passion is admirable and so rare
these days but there are details to

21:19.179 --> 21:19.960
consider

21:19.960 --> 21:24.429
well like I said this is not my thing oh
I'd say you're doing fine

21:25.089 --> 21:32.109
wouldn't you greatly anyway I say
goodbye to him and my old life and I've

21:32.109 --> 21:34.089
just run my fifth marathon

21:34.089 --> 21:40.178
yeah what was your best time I don't
remember but I've never been in better

21:40.179 --> 21:41.080
shape

21:41.079 --> 21:44.619
really and you still manage to gobble
down that creme brulee

21:47.710 --> 21:50.710
I think I'll go fresh

21:55.160 --> 22:00.950
ok what is with the attitude you're
screwing this deep screwing this deal

22:00.950 --> 22:04.640
no I'm making this deal look I'm
explaining to what the center does and

22:04.640 --> 22:05.480
what I do

22:05.480 --> 22:10.160
if you let me do what I do I could have
secured 35% I don't give a damn about a

22:10.160 --> 22:11.450
few extra bucks

22:11.450 --> 22:15.769
I don't want to be here all i care about
is my Center and my team

22:15.769 --> 22:18.650
I'm gonna sit around and argue for an
extra buck should give us what she can

22:18.650 --> 22:22.820
and wants to give wake up Sean ok she's
breaking down the payment to nothing

22:22.819 --> 22:26.720
you got your mind off her body you'd
realize it oh is that what this is all

22:26.720 --> 22:27.650
