You said you wanted to live
in a world without zinc, Jimmy.

Well, now your car
has no battery.

00:31.930 --> 00:33.730
But I promised Betty I'd pick
her up by six.

I better give her a call.

Dear God.

Think again, Jimmy.

You see, the firing pin
in your gun was made of...

00:56.920 --> 00:58.760

Come back, zinc.

Come back.

Zinc, zinc!

01:09.100 --> 01:10.240
What?

01:10.300 --> 01:13.470
Oh, it was all a dream.

Thank goodness I still live

One more day at least.

Why not?

02:20.440 --> 02:21.410
It might be fun.

02:21.470 --> 02:22.410
Kind of a lark.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.280
Kids, this is a yo-yo.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.980
Kind of dull, huh?

03:06.050 --> 03:08.550
Not much competition

These guys must be millionaires.

I'll bet they get
all kinds of girls.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.990
I question the educational
value of this assembly.

Hey, it will be one of
their few pleasant memories

- No.

- Oh.

This isn't you.

That's the old Sparkle.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.340
All right, get your

Marge, come here.

05:06.270 --> 05:07.670
Can you believe it?

05:07.740 --> 05:09.610
Pretty soon, I'll be able
to quit my job

05:09.670 --> 05:10.980
and live off the boy.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.380
What? Name me one person

That's it!
I am sick and tired

05:41.940 --> 05:43.570

A little something I call
"Plucking the Pickle."

and...

06:08.700 --> 06:10.440
I didn't do it.

Don't worry
about your wee fish, lass.

of Stinky and Wrinkles

Bart, if I were you,
and you were me

10:09.640 --> 10:11.610
Hello, Ned.

10:11.670 --> 10:14.800
Sorry to bother you,
Reverend Lovejoy, but I'm
kind of in a tizzy...

10:14.880 --> 10:16.810
Our son Todd just told us

10:16.880 --> 10:19.450
he didn't want to eat
his damn vegetables.

10:19.510 --> 10:20.910
You know kids and vegetables.

10:20.980 --> 10:22.010
What was it, asparagus?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.040
No, no, Reverend.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.220
The point is he said a bad word.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.690
Oh. Oh, right.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.830
Well, kids usually pick
these things up from someplace.

10:29.890 --> 10:33.200
Find out who's doing it
and uh, direct them
to the Bible.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.600
Where in the Bible?

10:34.660 --> 10:37.320
- Uh... page 900.
- <i>But, Rev--</i>

10:38.700 --> 10:40.170
Damn Flanders.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.240
Hey, Lise,
a moment of your time.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.510
Yeah?

10:44.570 --> 10:46.670
Suppose I was writing
a second letter to a girl

10:46.740 --> 10:48.650
and I already used up
my "A" material.

10:48.710 --> 10:50.310
What should I say?

10:50.380 --> 10:51.950
Ooh, could it be
there's a special someone

10:52.010 --> 10:52.970
you're not
telling me about?

10:53.050 --> 10:54.150
- Oh please!
- Is it Teri?

10:54.220 --> 10:54.790
No.

10:54.850 --> 10:55.450
Is it Sheri?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.120
No!

10:56.180 --> 10:56.910
Is it that girl

10:56.990 --> 10:57.820
with the lazy eye patch?

10:57.890 --> 10:58.890
No!

10:58.950 --> 11:00.780
Is it that exchange student
Mix-pa?

11:00.860 --> 11:02.730
No! It's not for me.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.360
It's... homework.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.400
Sure it is.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.700
Hey, Bart,
let's do some homework.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.730
( <i>kissing )</i>

11:10.800 --> 11:12.240
( <i>groans )</i>

11:12.300 --> 11:15.410
Golly, Sergeant Carter,
I can't fix your Jeep

11:15.470 --> 11:18.110
but maybe this
will make it up to you.

11:18.170 --> 11:21.870
( <i>deep baritone: )
♪ Galveston, oh, Galveston... ♪</i>

11:21.940 --> 11:23.840
Is this all he watches?

11:23.910 --> 11:26.150
He used to watch
<i>Davy and Goliath</i>

11:26.210 --> 11:28.710
but he thought the idea
of a talking dog

11:28.780 --> 11:30.780
was blasphemous.

11:30.850 --> 11:32.950
Hey Mom, did you save
the love letters
Dad sent you?

11:33.020 --> 11:34.930
Of course I saved them.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.830
Well, actually,
there's only one

11:36.890 --> 11:38.100
and it's more

11:38.160 --> 11:39.960
of a love postcard
from some brewery he visited.

11:42.130 --> 11:44.370
Homer:
<i>"Maybe it's the beer talking</i>

11:44.430 --> 11:46.890
<i>"but you've got a butt
that won't quit.</i>

11:46.970 --> 11:49.640
<i>They got these big,
chewy pretzels here..."</i>

11:49.700 --> 11:51.330
( <i>slurring speech )</i>

11:51.410 --> 11:53.680
<i>"...five dollars?!
Get outta here."</i>

11:53.740 --> 11:56.510
Wow, a side of Dad
I've never seen!

11:56.580 --> 11:57.680
( <i>sighs )</i>

11:57.750 --> 11:59.550
Penny for your thoughts,
Miss K.

11:59.610 --> 12:00.940
I was just thinking...

12:01.020 --> 12:02.790
You wouldn't
be interested.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.620
Try me.
Sometimes it helps to talk.

12:04.690 --> 12:05.920
( <i>hawks and spits )</i>

12:05.990 --> 12:08.630
Well, I was just wishing
I could meet a man

12:08.690 --> 12:11.800
who likes the way I look
first thing in the morning

12:11.860 --> 12:13.800
Laughs at my jokes...
Uh-huh.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.730
Can fix my car.
Oh, yeah.

12:15.800 --> 12:20.440
Bart:
<i>"Dear Edna, your photo
took my breath away.</i>

12:20.500 --> 12:24.480
Woodrow:
<i>"Truly, yours is a butt
that won't quit.</i>

12:24.540 --> 12:26.040
<i>"Yesterday morning</i>

12:26.110 --> 12:28.550
<i>"I put your picture up

12:28.610 --> 12:31.780
<i>to inspire me while I

12:31.850 --> 12:33.850
( <i>moans and glugs )</i>

12:33.920 --> 12:35.050
At last,
we've built the mission.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.820
Finally, the villagers
have a place to pray.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.960

12:46.360 --> 12:48.000
Well, he's not getting it

12:48.060 --> 12:49.990
that's for darn sure.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.840
Homer:
<i>Damn crappy nails!</i>

12:51.900 --> 12:53.870
<i>Super Glue, my butt!</i>

12:53.940 --> 12:54.810

12:56.340 --> 12:57.940
Hit it..! Shot..! D-ohh!

12:58.010 --> 12:58.940
Homer?

12:59.010 --> 13:00.480
What is it, Flanders?

13:00.540 --> 13:03.410
I'm afraid I have a bone
to pick with you.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.320
Look, if it's about
your camcorder,
I lost it, okay?

13:06.380 --> 13:11.260
No, I came to talk to you
about your... potty mouth.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.760
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:12.820 --> 13:15.490
Look Homer, all of us pull a
few boners now and then--

13:15.560 --> 13:18.830
go off half-cocked,
make asses of ourselves.

13:18.890 --> 13:21.160
So, I don't want
to be hard on you but

13:21.230 --> 13:23.400
I just wish you
wouldn't curse
in front of my boys.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.570
Oh, come on now, Flanders.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.930
I don't complain about your...

13:29.000 --> 13:30.600
moustache.

13:30.670 --> 13:32.910
What's wrong with my moustache?

13:32.970 --> 13:36.000
Uh, it makes you look like
you got something to hide.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.010
What?

13:37.080 --> 13:38.350
People are talking.

13:38.410 --> 13:39.710
Lots of people.

13:39.780 --> 13:41.050
Okay, Mister

13:41.120 --> 13:42.420
you've got a deal.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.480
I'll shave off
the soup-strainer

13:44.550 --> 13:46.510
if you give the sailor talk
the old heave-ho, okay?

13:46.590 --> 13:49.560
Aye, aye... Admiral Butthead.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.450
Announcer:
<i>We now return to</i>

13:51.530 --> 13:54.000
<i>Two for Tunisia

13:54.060 --> 13:55.770
Ah, my love.

13:55.830 --> 13:59.100
A million poets could try
for a million years

13:59.170 --> 14:03.040
and still describe but
three-eighths of your beauty.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.200
Whoa, slow down, Frenchy.

14:05.270 --> 14:06.830
This stuff is <i>gold.</i>

14:06.910 --> 14:09.950
Wow! "A million poets working
for a million years..."

14:10.010 --> 14:11.520
You're so lucky.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.720
When are you
going to meet him?

14:13.780 --> 14:16.020
First, I ask him
to send a photo.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.110
If he's got everything
where it should be

14:17.190 --> 14:18.220
I'm reeling him in.

14:18.290 --> 14:21.560
( <i>laughing )</i>

14:23.860 --> 14:25.600
Strap on your skates, Gordie.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.730
You're going in.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.500
<i>Hey, Marge, do you want to hear</i>

14:29.560 --> 14:30.520
something funny?

14:30.600 --> 14:33.170
Flanders thinks
I swear too much.

14:33.230 --> 14:35.160
( <i>giggling )</i>

14:35.240 --> 14:36.640
Marge, you're not laughing.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.330
Well, maybe he's right.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.080
Well, what a surprise.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.950
Marge sticks up
for Flanders.

14:42.010 --> 14:44.010
Can we have
one conversation

14:44.080 --> 14:46.680
where you <i>don't bring up
your hero Ned Flanders?</i>

14:46.750 --> 14:48.490
Actually Homer,
<i>you brought up
Ned Flanders.</i>

14:48.550 --> 14:49.350
Look, we're past that..Marge.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.260
Maybe I do curse a little

14:51.320 --> 14:55.030
but that's the way God made me,
and I'm too old to stop now.

14:55.090 --> 14:56.730
<i>No, you're not.</i>

14:56.790 --> 14:59.760
When my father got
out of the Navy, he used to
curse a blue streak.

14:59.830 --> 15:02.870
It almost cost him his job
as a baby photographer.

15:02.930 --> 15:05.900
So my Mom put a swear jar
in the kitchen.

15:05.970 --> 15:08.270
Every time he said
a bad word

15:08.340 --> 15:10.940
he put in a quarter.
What do you think?

15:11.010 --> 15:12.840
Well, Marge

15:12.910 --> 15:16.150
self-improvement has always
been a passion of mine.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.020
Bring on the swear jar.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.580
Do I have to pay if I
hit my hand with a hammer?

15:20.650 --> 15:21.590
Yes, Homer.

15:21.650 --> 15:22.590
What if I catch on fire?

15:22.650 --> 15:23.850
No, Homer.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.420
What if I see something
really weird in the sky?

15:25.490 --> 15:26.420
Yes, Homer.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.160
What about when we snuggle?

15:28.220 --> 15:30.220
Hmm...
that's okay.

15:30.290 --> 15:33.360
Miss Krabappel:
<i>"Dear Woodrow,
it's time for us to meet.</i>

15:33.430 --> 15:35.770
<i>"Why don't we go out to dinner?</i>

15:35.830 --> 15:39.200
<i>And afterward, we can go
to my apartment for some
home cookin'."</i>

15:39.270 --> 15:40.070
Huh?

15:40.130 --> 15:41.660
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

15:41.740 --> 15:43.740
<i>"Hungrily yours, Edna."</i>

15:43.810 --> 15:45.110
Well, she's dangled

15:45.170 --> 15:46.500
on the line long enough.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.500
It's time to boat this bass.

15:48.580 --> 15:53.480
"When I read your letters,
I feel as if you are right
here watching me."

15:53.550 --> 15:54.690
Bart! Eyes down.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.390
Yes, Ma'am.

15:56.450 --> 15:57.820
Bart:
<i>"Edna, every second
until we meet</i>

15:57.890 --> 15:59.820
<i>"stabs me like
a thousand needles.</i>

15:59.890 --> 16:02.560
Woodrow:
<i>"Join me at the Gilded Truffle
this Saturday at 8:00.</i>

16:02.620 --> 16:05.690
<i>"Perhaps later
we will smooch up a storm.</i>

16:05.760 --> 16:08.430
<i>Sexily yours, Woody."</i>

16:14.000 --> 16:15.010

( <i>laughing )</i>

16:25.180 --> 16:26.180

16:26.250 --> 16:27.120
Huh?

16:28.980 --> 16:31.880
( <i>crying )</i>

16:34.190 --> 16:38.630
Oh, I can't help but feel
partly responsible.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.890
Homer,
that was a 20.

16:44.970 --> 16:45.840
Da..!

16:50.510 --> 16:52.080
Oh, you son of a..!

16:54.510 --> 16:56.250
Homer, I owe you one, buddy.

16:56.310 --> 16:59.580
No sooner had I shaved off
the old cookie duster

16:59.650 --> 17:02.220
than a lady cast me
in a commercial.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.680
I tell ya' the way these
checks keep coming in--
it's almost criminal.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.310
You dirty bast..!

17:08.260 --> 17:09.930
What do you think,
Lisa?

17:09.990 --> 17:12.200
How's the dog
supposed to get in?

17:12.260 --> 17:13.700
Well, he just goes...

17:13.760 --> 17:14.930
Ohh!

17:16.430 --> 17:18.040
( <i>snoring )</i>

17:18.099 --> 17:19.500
( <i>screams )</i>

17:23.440 --> 17:24.710
( <i>sighing )</i>

17:24.770 --> 17:26.930
Oh, Woodrow,
how could you stand me up?

17:27.010 --> 17:29.110
Mrs. K., whoever this guy is,
you don't need him.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.550
There are plenty
of good men around.

17:31.610 --> 17:32.710
Name one.

17:32.780 --> 17:33.880
What's wrong
with Principal Skinner?

17:33.950 --> 17:35.990
Seymour? Hmph.

17:36.050 --> 17:39.090
Let's just say his mommy
won't let him out to play.

17:39.150 --> 17:40.750
What about Coach Fortner?

17:40.820 --> 17:42.330
Glug, glug, glug, glug...

17:42.390 --> 17:44.090
Wow.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.200
What about Groundskeeper Willy?

17:46.260 --> 17:49.200
Ugh! I'm not even gonna tell you
what that guy's into.

17:49.260 --> 17:53.130
Bart, you are the closest
thing to a man in my life

17:53.200 --> 17:56.970
and that's so depressing
I think I'm going to cry.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.640
( <i>sobbing )</i>

18:00.710 --> 18:02.880
( <i>groaning )</i>

18:04.010 --> 18:04.950
Aah..!

18:05.010 --> 18:07.910
Oh, fudge... that's broken.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.640
Fiddle-dee-dee.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.090
That will require
a tetanus shot.

18:12.150 --> 18:14.580
I'm not going to swear

18:14.660 --> 18:15.990
but I am going

18:16.060 --> 18:18.430
to kick this doghouse down!

18:18.490 --> 18:19.950
( <i>ranting )</i>

18:20.030 --> 18:23.400
Dad, this is not
a commentary on your skills

18:23.460 --> 18:25.490
but we bought you
a new doghouse.

18:25.570 --> 18:27.000
Where'd you get the money?

18:27.070 --> 18:29.240
There was more than enough
in the swear jar

18:29.300 --> 18:33.030
and if you look
inside the doghouse
there's a little surprise.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.250
Maggie.

18:35.310 --> 18:36.310
Oh, cute.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.780
No, behind her.

18:37.850 --> 18:38.820
( <i>gasps )</i>

18:38.880 --> 18:39.880
Beer!

18:39.950 --> 18:41.850
How did you know?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.720
Where's Maggie?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.560
Where's Maggie?

18:45.620 --> 18:47.560
There's Maggie!

18:47.620 --> 18:49.780
( <i>makes raspberries
on her belly )</i>

18:49.840 --> 18:52.450
Mom, this is a little
ahead  sofchedule

18:52.510 --> 18:55.020
but I need help
with my love life.

18:55.080 --> 18:58.620
Oh, my special little guy
has a sweetheart.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.880
( <i>snickering )</i>

18:59.950 --> 19:01.190
I knew it!

19:01.250 --> 19:02.850
Alright Bart,
who's your girlfriend?

19:02.920 --> 19:04.260
Mrs. Krabappel.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.890
Hmm.
Hmm.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.230
( <i>whistles )</i>

19:07.290 --> 19:09.460
Bart, this is your teacher?

19:09.530 --> 19:11.630
I should start going
to parent's night.

19:11.700 --> 19:12.570
( <i>growls )</i>

19:12.630 --> 19:13.670
Homer!

19:13.730 --> 19:15.100
Bart, you did a
very cruel thing.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.910
Boy, you've got to go
to your teacher

19:17.970 --> 19:19.540
and tell her
the truth.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.930
No, Homer. The truth
would humiliate her.

19:22.010 --> 19:25.080
Oh Marge, I only said it
because I thought that's what
<i>you wanted to hear.</i>

19:25.140 --> 19:27.340
Lisa:
Maybe we should
write her another letter

19:27.410 --> 19:30.120
One that says good-bye,
but let's her feel loved.

19:30.180 --> 19:31.750
Step aside, everyone.

19:31.820 --> 19:34.660
Sensitive love letters
are my specialty.

19:34.720 --> 19:38.260
"Dear Baby,
Welcome to Dumpville.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.250
Population: you."

19:40.320 --> 19:42.150
We'll all help.

19:42.230 --> 19:45.570
"Though I'll be inoculating
babies in Kampuchea

19:45.630 --> 19:46.930
my heart will
always be with you."

19:47.000 --> 19:48.340
That sucks.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.000
How about "crocodiles
bit off my face"?

19:51.070 --> 19:53.840
That's disgusting,
and besides

19:53.910 --> 19:57.180
when a woman loves a man,
it doesn't matter that a
crocodile bit off his face.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.710
I may hold you
to that, Marge.

19:59.780 --> 20:03.620
Okay, okay..
"I cannot see you
for the next five years

20:03.680 --> 20:05.720
for I will be farming
the ocean floor."

20:05.780 --> 20:06.740
( <i>buzzes )</i>

20:06.820 --> 20:08.620
"I must finish
this letter quickly

20:08.690 --> 20:11.360
for I have only
four minutes to live."

20:11.420 --> 20:14.450
Three simple words:
"I am gay."

20:14.530 --> 20:17.800
Homer, for the last time,
I am not putting that in.

20:17.860 --> 20:20.330
"And anytime I hear
the wind blow

20:20.400 --> 20:23.300
it will whisper
the name... <i>Edna."</i>

20:23.370 --> 20:25.210
Oh, that's
very good, Lisa.

20:25.270 --> 20:27.040
"P.S.: I am gay."

20:27.110 --> 20:28.440
( <i>both groaning )</i>

20:28.510 --> 20:30.080
How shall we end it?

20:30.140 --> 20:33.250
How about, "with a love that
will echo through the ages."

20:33.310 --> 20:34.620
Aww.
Ooh!

20:34.680 --> 20:35.920
That's sweet.

20:35.980 --> 20:38.020
Homer, you old
honey dripper.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.340
Why, you little...
hee, hee.

20:50.060 --> 20:51.670
Huh?

20:51.730 --> 20:52.730
( <i>gasps )</i>

20:52.800 --> 20:53.770
Wait!

20:53.830 --> 20:54.740
Wait!

20:57.870 --> 21:01.170
Woodrow:
<i>"Dearest Edna,
I must leave you.</i>

21:01.240 --> 21:03.310
<i>"Why? I cannot say.</i>

21:03.370 --> 21:05.800
<i>"Where? You cannot know.</i>

21:05.880 --> 21:07.680
<i>"How I will get there</i>

21:07.750 --> 21:10.180
<i>"I haven't decided yet.</i>

21:10.250 --> 21:12.150
<i>"But one thing I can tell you</i>

21:12.220 --> 21:14.420
<i>"any time I hear the wind blow</i>

21:14.490 --> 21:17.060
<i>it will whisper
the name... Edna."</i>

21:17.120 --> 21:18.760
Ohh..!

21:18.820 --> 21:21.490
( <i>humming )</i>

21:21.560 --> 21:23.800
Bart, it's such
a nice day today

21:23.860 --> 21:26.070
let's have detention
outside.

21:26.130 --> 21:27.500
It's a date.
