00:03.240 --> 00:04.400
TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.440 --> 00:07.080
You have a genetic obligation
to talk to me.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.599
-Oh, well, can we do that
while I'm writing job

00:08.640 --> 00:10.080
applications?

00:10.119 --> 00:11.679
The company decided today that
it's time I spread my wings.

00:15.679 --> 00:18.399
-Just wondering if this was
strictly a professional

00:18.440 --> 00:19.760
relationship between us.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.480
-You're never going
to make it.

00:21.519 --> 00:24.160
You're not good enough,
and you never will be.

00:24.199 --> 00:26.199
-So why didn't you fight
getting expelled.

00:26.239 --> 00:27.160
-I broke the rules.

00:27.199 --> 00:29.079
I, I went to an outside
doctor.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.679
-I think I need an estimate of
how long you're going to hate

00:32.719 --> 00:34.159
me.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.079
-If the doctors say that my
fracture has healed, will you

00:36.119 --> 00:38.039
help me plead my case
at the academy?

00:38.079 --> 00:40.640
-Webster, I thought
you'd never ask.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.159
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.600
Close your eyes.

01:01.640 --> 01:06.079
Take a leap of faith, and
lead the way to life.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.480
This is my chance.

01:11.519 --> 01:15.640
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:28.599 --> 01:30.079
TARA NARRATING: Last summer,
when I came home for the

01:30.120 --> 01:32.280
holidays, I discovered
that mom had given

01:32.319 --> 01:35.280
most of my toys away.

01:35.319 --> 01:38.640
She didn't understand why
I was so traumatized.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.120
From her point of view,
they weren't a

01:40.159 --> 01:42.799
part of my life anymore.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.040
It was time to move on.

01:45.079 --> 01:47.239
-And you finish up at the
company this week?

01:47.280 --> 01:48.560
-Yeah.

01:48.599 --> 01:51.359
Uh, look, loved being there,
but really excited about

01:51.400 --> 01:54.120
taking the next step,
you know?

01:54.159 --> 01:55.680
TARA NARRATING: But when you're
an only child, and you

01:55.719 --> 01:58.680
live 40 minutes out of town,
your toys end up

01:58.719 --> 01:59.799
becoming your friends.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.760
-I'm going to miss you.

02:01.799 --> 02:04.159
-If we're going, we
should leave now.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.120
TARA NARRATING: And I wasn't
ready to say goodbye.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.758
-Look, the thing is, I'm
not a clone of my dad.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.199
I have my own voice.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.560
And I'm really excited about
getting to start to express

02:11.599 --> 02:12.080
that.

02:12.120 --> 02:12.599
-Right.

02:12.639 --> 02:13.479
Latte, please.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.080
TARA NARRATING: I've always been
so impatient to grow up.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.360
It's just lately that I want to
stop time, and live in toy

02:23.400 --> 02:24.560
world a bit longer.

02:27.199 --> 02:28.560
I guess that's the thing
you don't realize

02:28.599 --> 02:31.080
about the adult world.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.719
It's actually kind of tough.

02:32.759 --> 02:35.759
-If there's any opportunity to
observe, I'm willing to do

02:35.800 --> 02:37.159
unpaid work.

02:40.439 --> 02:43.080
-The doctors have all said the
fractures were caused by

02:43.120 --> 02:45.159
force, and that they
were recent.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.599
-Ben was there.

02:46.639 --> 02:49.719
He saw Saskia stretch me, and
then refuse to stop when I

02:49.759 --> 02:52.439
asked her to.

02:52.479 --> 02:54.400
-This is a very serious
accusation.

02:54.439 --> 02:55.080
TARA'S DAD (OFFSCREEN):
Yes, it is.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.159
And we want her gone.

02:56.199 --> 02:57.400
-Dad, no.

02:57.439 --> 02:59.080
I just want to come back
to the academy.

02:59.120 --> 02:59.840
TARA'S DAD (OFFSCREEN): It's
not an option while she's

02:59.879 --> 03:01.680
still teaching here.

03:01.719 --> 03:03.759
I'm hoping that the academy
will do what's right.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.319
But I do have an appointment
with a solicitor later today.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.639
-Hola, Barcelona.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.240
Impression totes drooled
on your showreel.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.680
-Yeah.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.439
They said to call in for a
coffee next time I'm in town.

03:19.479 --> 03:20.800
-That's polite for no thanks.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.400
Local indie musical seeking
dance captain.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.479
-OK, remember "Pirates of
Penzance," you walked out

03:32.520 --> 03:35.840
saying it was cheesy and
insulting to your dance

03:35.879 --> 03:36.800
sensibilities.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.080
-It was cheesy.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.400
-You were five.

03:39.439 --> 03:41.800
Ethan, you have always
hated musicals.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.759
-Well, maybe I'm the right
person to reinvent them.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.800
-If we sue the academy, how
long will that take?

03:49.840 --> 03:52.560
-I don't know, princess.
a while.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.599
-And it will be expensive,
won't it.

03:54.639 --> 03:56.800
I just want this to be over.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.120
-You're here.

03:58.159 --> 03:59.319
-Hey, Kat.

04:04.439 --> 04:06.800
OK, I'll, uh, leave you
girls to catch up.

04:11.639 --> 04:13.240
-How's your back?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.199
-It's still sore.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.680
The bone knits, so
it's healing.

04:15.719 --> 04:17.040
-Does that mean that--

04:17.079 --> 04:22.560
-Tara, I have been wilting in
this place without you.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.040
Ew, awkwardness.

04:25.079 --> 04:26.439
You don't need that.

04:32.720 --> 04:43.800
[vocal exercises]

04:43.839 --> 04:46.800
You got me out of dance
history for this?

04:46.839 --> 04:47.560
Ew.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.040
I'm allergic to musicals.

04:49.079 --> 04:50.319
-Come on.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.360
After all the work that I
did on your Prix solo?

04:51.399 --> 04:52.360
Please.

04:52.399 --> 04:53.639
-Ballet dude.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.639
-Ethan.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.279
-Ben.

04:55.319 --> 04:56.560
Love ballet--

04:56.600 --> 04:58.800
the modern stuff, not that
ye olde world classics.

04:58.839 --> 05:02.480
Who gets into that?

05:02.519 --> 05:04.240
-Um, this is Abigail.

05:04.279 --> 05:05.800
She's my human show reel.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.800
-Oh, well can you be
ready to go next?

05:07.839 --> 05:09.240
-Sure.

05:09.279 --> 05:12.199
Um, so I will chore as many
dances as you want, be your

05:12.240 --> 05:15.199
own personal handmaiden.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.160
-If you get this job, I'm
taking a percentage.

05:20.680 --> 05:25.720
-Uh, so I'm feeling you would
call for us to just--

05:25.759 --> 05:27.560
-Do it.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.120
-OK.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.319
Do it.

05:41.439 --> 05:42.600
You all right?

05:45.399 --> 05:47.079
[playing piano]

05:58.199 --> 05:58.720
-Yeah, yeah.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.319
That'll do.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.199
-Um, did you mean that
in a good way?

06:04.240 --> 06:05.360
-Are you serious?

06:05.399 --> 06:09.800
That was, ugh, I'm in
love with you both.

06:09.839 --> 06:11.800
Could you stick around and check
out the other auditions?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.000
-Yeah.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.800
-You're like the most
experienced person here.

06:16.839 --> 06:19.319
-Hey, are you sure you're not
missing out on any classics?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.839
I'll pay for a cab.

06:20.879 --> 06:22.600
-It's lunch time.

06:22.639 --> 06:24.800
I've always wanted to be the
mean judge on a panel.

06:24.839 --> 06:31.839
-[singing operatically]

06:31.879 --> 06:33.519
[music playing]

06:40.519 --> 06:44.399
-You know, this guy actually
has something.

06:44.439 --> 06:45.639
Yeah.

06:47.839 --> 06:51.199
-Well, Tara said stop,
like pretty loudly.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.680
And then Saskia gave
another push.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.480
And then Tara's back
just went snap.

06:55.519 --> 06:58.199
It was like knuckles
crunching.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.720
-And you were so concerned, you
didn't tell anyone about

06:59.759 --> 07:00.560
it.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.319
-Well, Tara said she was fine.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.759
And we're dancers.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.360
Things make noises
all the time.

07:06.399 --> 07:10.279
But this was different, now
that I think about it.

07:10.319 --> 07:12.600
-When was the first time Tara
told you her injury was

07:12.639 --> 07:13.600
Saskia's fault?

07:13.639 --> 07:17.279
Before or after she
was expelled?

07:17.319 --> 07:18.199
-After.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.399
No, but--

07:25.480 --> 07:27.399
-I couldn't talk to anyone.

07:27.439 --> 07:28.759
I went into shut down.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.319
-I was there when you
had the scan.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.360
You said you were fine.

07:31.399 --> 07:33.720
-I guess we all have
our secrets.

07:33.759 --> 07:36.639
-And the awkward moments
keep coming.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.560
I think the real tragedy here
is that we could have been

07:38.600 --> 07:41.079
torturing Saskia
all this time.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.800
-Hey Tara, I met your dad.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.199
TARA'S DAD (OFFSCREEN): Ms.
Raine wants to see us.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.040
That teacher's going
to be there, too.

07:48.079 --> 07:49.439
BEN (OFFSCREEN): I
was rock solid.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.680
She pretended not believe me.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.680
But she's almost definitely
on your side now.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.199
-[sighing]

07:59.839 --> 08:03.040
-I have good news.

08:03.079 --> 08:06.040
The board has agreed to allow
Tara back into the academy,

08:06.079 --> 08:08.360
conditional on good
behavior period.

08:08.399 --> 08:10.680
-What about her?

08:10.720 --> 08:12.639
-Saskia has denied that she
did anything wrong.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.600
And I don't have any evidence
that she did.

08:14.639 --> 08:15.839
-She broke my daughter's back.

08:15.879 --> 08:17.160
How much evidence--

08:17.199 --> 08:18.000
-Mr. Webster, I know this is
a difficult situation.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.360
I'm trying to find a solution.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.600
TARA'S DAD (OFFSCREEN): You're
trying to protect the

08:20.639 --> 08:23.079
academy's backside,
and a negligent,

08:23.120 --> 08:24.199
inexperienced teacher.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.399
-Dad.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.360
I would love to come back to
the academy, provided that

08:30.399 --> 08:32.399
Saskia apologizes for
what she did to me.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.080
-I'm--

08:41.639 --> 08:43.639
I did nothing to you, Tara.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.000
MS. RAINE (OFFSCREEN): Saskia.

08:45.039 --> 08:46.600
SASKIA (OFFSCREEN): No, I can't
just sit here and-- it's

08:46.639 --> 08:48.080
ridiculous.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.799
This is just the next chapter in
her personal grudge against

08:49.840 --> 08:50.639
me.

08:50.679 --> 08:52.159
-I'm the one with the grudge?

08:52.200 --> 08:55.399
-There is nothing I did in any
class that I didn't experience

08:55.440 --> 08:56.799
when I was a student.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.200
Tara was just too weak to--

08:58.240 --> 08:59.440
-That's enough, Saskia.

09:03.399 --> 09:06.399
-Then I can't accept.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.759
If Saskia gets away with this,
then it obviously means that

09:09.799 --> 09:13.080
the academy thinks that
what she did was OK.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.320
And it wasn't.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.320
-This is everything you've
worked for, Tara.

09:21.639 --> 09:23.480
-It could happen to
someone else.

09:32.159 --> 09:34.480
I'd like to say goodbye,
properly this time.

09:34.519 --> 09:36.440
-Just give me a call when you
want me to pick you up.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.039
You were brave in there,
sweetheart.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.519
-Neal.

10:02.559 --> 10:05.279
-City kid, how you doing?

10:05.320 --> 10:08.360
-Look, I just wanted
to say, I'm sorry.

10:08.399 --> 10:11.600
After everything you guys have
done for me, I should have

10:11.639 --> 10:15.480
looked after her better.

10:15.519 --> 10:17.080
-Wasn't your job.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.279
-Yeah, it was.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.639
-(SINGING) You may--

10:35.679 --> 10:41.360
You may believe that it's
safe where it's warm.

10:41.399 --> 10:46.720
I've seen what lies in
the eye of the storm.

10:46.759 --> 10:48.080
[humming].

10:49.720 --> 10:51.080
-Busted.

10:54.679 --> 10:57.440
-Let the walls tear down.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.159
Let the floors all drown.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.759
Wow.

11:01.799 --> 11:03.559
It's poetry.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
-Be nice.

11:04.639 --> 11:05.799
This is Finn's dream project.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.279
I'm just trying to make
it good for him.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.159
-So noble of you, making other
people dream's a reality.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.399
-Well, you can help me.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.159
Because I need to hear
this so I can start

11:15.200 --> 11:16.399
visualizing the chore.

11:19.399 --> 11:22.159
One, two, three, four.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.120
-(SINGING BADLY) You may
believe that it's

11:25.159 --> 11:27.279
safe where it's warm.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.159
[giggling]

11:28.200 --> 11:32.000
-So inspired right now.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.200
For real.

[piano playing]

11:37.360 --> 11:39.159

believe that it's

Any imbecile can sing.

You open your mouth, and
sound comes out.

-Not like that.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.360
-Tara-related baking?

-Uh, no, the musical.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.080
But I think it will
be interesting.

-Oh, look at you being
all non-judgy.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.559
You know, we're going to
have to celebrate this

13:19.600 --> 13:20.919
biographical moment.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.200
-We really don't need to make
a big deal out of it.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.559
-At the very least, it will
stop me from baking.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.759
-Fair enough.

-Come on, guys.

healing, Saskia?

13:41.080 --> 13:43.000
-Slowly, Grace.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.759
Good, Abigail.

14:16.799 --> 14:19.240
I think you can make that
extension even better, though.

14:19.279 --> 14:20.600
-Really?

14:20.639 --> 14:22.159
Maybe you could stretch
it out for me.

14:31.759 --> 14:36.519

clover hunting again?

14:36.559 --> 14:38.759
-I wanted to take one with me.

14:38.799 --> 14:42.120
I found five.

about the job.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.600
I'm really happy for you.

14:47.639 --> 14:49.200
-It's just fringe theater.

But Kat demands that it be
celebrated like I conquered

14:51.799 --> 14:54.159

14:54.200 --> 14:55.559
Uh, right.

14:55.600 --> 15:01.279
Um, you know she would never
deliberately hurt you.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.600
-How did you forgive me?

15:03.639 --> 15:05.159
I mean, I, I knew I hurt you.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.759
But I didn't get it,
not properly.

15:08.799 --> 15:11.279
-It took a while.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.200
But if I didn't forgive you,
then I wouldn't be getting to

15:15.240 --> 15:17.120

15:17.159 --> 15:20.639
It kind of makes it worth it.

-You used to be Ethan Karamakov,
star of third year.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.400
You turned down a contact with
the company so you could

17:59.440 --> 18:01.200
choreograph.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.559
And then you stayed
here because--

18:03.599 --> 18:05.519
-I wanted to learn?

18:05.559 --> 18:09.359
And I wasn't ready to
go out on my own.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.480
-That's OK.

we dance the same way.

it before.

exactly like you.

your hero, Tara.

How could you want to take
that away from me?

19:51.640 --> 19:53.480
-Your injury wasn't my fault.

19:53.519 --> 19:57.160
And before that you picked
on me, and belittled me.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.519
You made me wake up every
day feeling sick

20:00.559 --> 20:01.440

bought a ticket to Barcelona.

spectrum of growing up,
