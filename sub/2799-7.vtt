Who are they?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.073
Tell Control these guys

01:04.105 --> 01:06.108

keep your head down.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.911
They're out of rifle ammo!

01:58.952 --> 02:00.662
No! Get down!
They got more!

02:08.169 --> 02:08.669
Let's go,ese!

02:13.175 --> 02:14.176

02:14.176 --> 02:15.677
I'm going left.
You go right.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.678
Going to take these guys.

I'll stay with him.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.697
I'll take care of him.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.705
Que paso?

02:43.747 --> 02:44.706
Nada.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.207
Adentro! Adentro!

02:48.710 --> 02:49.211
Cuff him.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.968
Dame una ambulancia, guey.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.219
I don't speak Spanish.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.729
Get back inside.
Get back inside.

03:22.244 --> 03:22.744
You okay?

03:23.245 --> 03:24.246
Yeah. You?

03:24.288 --> 03:24.746
Yeah.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.252
What are you doing?
Put it down.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.753
Yeah. Sorry.
I was just trying

03:32.254 --> 03:33.255
to secure his gun.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.256
He's not going
to be using it anymore.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.259
Stop! Police!

03:37.259 --> 03:38.760
Stop! Police!
Don't move!

03:40.262 --> 03:41.763
Don't move!

03:56.778 --> 03:58.280
Brass, suspect's in custody.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.281
Copy.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.033
Control, this is Brass.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.784
Situation here is Code 4.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.286
We have three suspects
in custody.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.287
One is on the run.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.292
You know it's go
ing to be a long shift

04:10.292 --> 04:12.294
when you get the call
to respond to a command post.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.296
Yeah. Warrick...

04:14.296 --> 04:15.797
we need everybody
from Grave.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.298
But park
on Wall Street.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.302
Jefferson's taped off
all the way back to Lincoln.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.803
The suspect was last seen
running south.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.805
These buildings have been
searched and cleared.

04:23.847 --> 04:24.806
Okay, move south one block.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.308
Check each apartment.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.310
This guy's armed and dangerous.
You got a lot of witnesses

04:28.352 --> 04:29.311
claiming to have seen
what happened.

04:29.811 --> 04:30.312
Okay, good. Let's get some vans
down here,

04:30.812 --> 04:31.813
bring them all to the station.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.315
What happened out here

04:33.815 --> 04:34.816
I was one of the shooters.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.319
So was Sofia, so you know the deal.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.321
That's really
all I'm allowed to say.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.822
I see Detective Ortega,

04:41.323 --> 04:42.824
that hardhead from IA,

04:42.866 --> 04:43.867
is handling the case.

04:43.909 --> 04:44.826
Just our luck, hmm?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.330
Caprice full of shooters

04:48.330 --> 04:49.832
opened up on two of
our guys. One's down.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.333
Is Bell
going to make it?

04:51.375 --> 04:52.835
He's DOA.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.336
Three suspects
are dead.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.838
Fourth outstanding.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.090
Excuse me. Guys, hang tight.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.842
I'm going to get
some rides.

04:59.842 --> 05:00.843
Take you down to the station, okay?

05:00.884 --> 05:01.844
I want to get
your statements.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.345
Yeah..

05:03.345 --> 05:04.346
Yeah.
Good, good

05:07.850 --> 05:08.851
I'll stay with them.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.352
I'll collect their
firearms and ammo.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.854
All right. Good luck.

05:12.354 --> 05:12.855
Thank you.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.108
Hell of a day, man

05:16.149 --> 05:17.860
It's just beginning.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.870
? Who... are you??

05:27.870 --> 05:30.372
? Who, who, who, who??

05:30.873 --> 05:33.876
? Who... are you??

05:34.376 --> 05:36.378
? Who, who, who, who??

05:36.378 --> 05:37.880
? I really want to know?

05:38.380 --> 05:40.632
? Who... are you??

05:40.632 --> 05:42.384
?Oh-oh-oh?
?Who...?

05:42.384 --> 05:45.387
? Come on and tell me,
who are you, you, you?

05:45.429 --> 05:48.390
? Oh, you!?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.902
GSW victim

05:59.902 --> 06:01.403
Matches the suspect.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.907
You shoot him?

06:04.907 --> 06:05.908
No, sir.
Found him this way.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.410
He's got a bike strap.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.411
This isn't our suspect.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.913
This is a kid on his way
to school.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.414
Where's his bike?
There was no bike.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.916
Put out a broadcast.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.919
Suspect may be on a bicycle.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.921
We need medical transport.
Code Three.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.924
Okay, everybody around here
has got a video camera

06:21.965 --> 06:23.425
or a cell phone camera

06:23.926 --> 06:24.927
They'll all be
taking pictures.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.429
I think we all know how to
operate in front of a camera.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.931
Don't be caugh t picking your nos e.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.183
Catherine's back
at the station

06:31.225 --> 06:32.935
collecting all
the officers' guns.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.937
This is the main crime scene.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.939
So, Nick, you
and Sara take this

06:36.939 --> 06:37.940
There's two additional
crime scenes

06:38.440 --> 06:39.441
down the alleys behind Third.

06:39.942 --> 06:40.943
Warrick, you take
the west alley.

06:40.984 --> 06:41.985
I'll take the east.

06:42.027 --> 06:42.945
And what do I get to do?

06:42.945 --> 06:45.447
Go back to the lab
and wait for a phone call?

06:45.447 --> 06:48.951
This is a running gun battle
that started 20 blocks back.

06:48.992 --> 06:49.952
You get that.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.954
That's got to be, like, a mile

06:51.995 --> 06:53.455
Who's with me?

06:53.455 --> 06:54.957
A bunch of pissed-off locals

06:54.998 --> 06:55.958
with shot-up cars.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.459
Awesome.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.460
You'll be all right.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.972
Grissom?

07:09.972 --> 07:11.974
Heard anything about Bell?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.976
He died, David.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.486
Is this gun
in it's original position?

07:24.987 --> 07:26.989
The arresting officers kicked it
clear of the suspect.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.496
Nobody's touched it
since I've been here.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.501
Well, there's no bullet holes

07:39.543 --> 07:40.502
in the back.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.503
That's always good.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.505
How many times was he hit?

07:43.547 --> 07:44.506
I don't know.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.508
Officer, can you remove
these handcuffs?

07:46.550 --> 07:47.509
Sure.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.518
You have anything
I can wipe these off with?

07:57.019 --> 07:58.020
Yeah.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.521
Thanks.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.531
Looks like three went in.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.532
All right, leave him here,
David.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.035
Warrick's DB is in
the other alley just over there.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.056
You did a good job
out there.

08:34.097 --> 08:37.558
Yeah. Not good enough.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.061
Has Bell's wife
been notified?

08:39.561 --> 08:41.063
The sheriff's on his way
to the house now.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.565
You know, she's pregnant

08:43.607 --> 08:45.859
with their third kid.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.070
We all know the risks.

08:52.074 --> 08:52.574
Hey...

09:02.084 --> 09:04.086
I remember
my first shooting...

09:04.127 --> 09:07.589
I appreciate the sentiment.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.341
We're not supposed
to talk to each other

09:09.383 --> 09:10.592
until after we've
given our statements.

09:10.634 --> 09:11.593
You're right.
You're right.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.594
You're up.

09:12.594 --> 09:13.595
Curtis, make yourself
comfortable.

09:13.637 --> 09:14.596
Okay.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.105
This is Detective
Nestor Ortega.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.107
I am in PD Interrogation

09:25.107 --> 09:29.111
taking a statement
from Captain James Brass

09:29.611 --> 09:31.613
regarding the officer-involved
shooting

09:31.613 --> 09:34.616
that occurred around
0643 hours this morning.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.118
CSI Willows

09:36.118 --> 09:40.122
is present to document
and collect

09:40.164 --> 09:41.623
Captain Brass's firearm

09:41.665 --> 09:45.127
as evidence.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.885
Ready?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.136
Yeah.

09:57.139 --> 09:58.891
You're not a patrol unit

09:58.932 --> 10:00.642
Why did you get involved

10:00.642 --> 10:02.144
is in the pursuit? Detective Curtis

10:02.144 --> 10:04.396
and I were just closing
a robbery case

10:04.438 --> 10:06.315
and, uh, we stopped
for a bite to eat.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.150
All units in the vicinity,

10:08.650 --> 10:09.651
Three-David-34 is in pursuit

10:09.693 --> 10:11.653
of a dark Chevy Caprice

10:11.653 --> 10:12.654
southbound on Paradise
toward Desert Springs.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.656
That's right near here.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.663
We joined the pursuit
on Desert Springs.

10:21.705 --> 10:25.167
So you elected to back up
the officers.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.668
Yes.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.670
Were the suspects
shooting at the time?

10:28.712 --> 10:30.172
Yes.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.673
Could you tell the types
of firearms they were using?

10:37.679 --> 10:40.182
Well, the two guys in the back
had rifles,

10:40.224 --> 10:42.184
maybe AK's.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.435
The other two had handguns.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.686
I'm not sure what type.

10:47.189 --> 10:48.690
We're flying over Third Street,

10:48.732 --> 10:50.192
where, just this morning,

10:50.692 --> 10:51.693
police were involved
in a deadly shoot-out.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.702
Looks like a porcupine

11:00.744 --> 11:01.703
There's not enough room

11:01.703 --> 11:03.705
between rods
for a human being to fit.

11:03.747 --> 11:04.706
No. Bell and Adams

11:04.706 --> 11:07.709
must have really been
swerving and weaving.

11:10.212 --> 11:13.715
78 bullet holes.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.718
And Bell wasn't hit
until he was outside the car.

11:17.219 --> 11:21.223
I heard Bell was a rookie,
barely off training.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.225
It was just his time,
I guess, huh?

11:27.229 --> 11:28.230
Suspect will be
getting a ride with the coroner.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.731
A little
street justice

11:29.773 --> 11:30.732
Civilians okay

11:30.732 --> 11:32.734
Some old lady's
going to need stitches.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.736
Kid on the bike's
critical. In surgery.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.739
You guys okay here?

11:37.739 --> 11:40.492
I'll call and have the suspect's
vehicle towed to CSI.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.245
I'm going to start digging
bullets out of people's houses

11:45.247 --> 11:48.750
I was just reloading
and continuing firing.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.252
I don't know what hit him.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.760
Bullets were flying.
There were multiple rounds.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.262
It was chaos.

12:00.262 --> 12:03.765
At what point did Carolyn Davis
go in foot pursuit

12:03.807 --> 12:05.267
after the two
suspects?

12:05.767 --> 12:07.769
After the driver went down,

12:07.769 --> 12:09.771
the other suspect,
I guess he felt

12:10.272 --> 12:10.772
it was getting
too hot back there

12:13.275 --> 12:15.277
And they were shooting
the entire time?

12:15.277 --> 12:20.782
Oh, yeah. I mean, it was like,
you know, those movie guns;

12:20.824 --> 12:22.576
they never run out of bullets.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.286
I don't go to the movies.

12:24.328 --> 12:25.287
Oh.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.291
What happened next?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.795
The next thing I remember...

12:38.300 --> 12:40.802
the next thing
I remember is Bell

12:46.308 --> 12:48.060
Bell went down

12:59.321 --> 13:03.325
He was... he was just a kid.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.335
Todo lo que vi fue la policia
disparando!

13:13.377 --> 13:14.837
Yo ohi que uno de ellos

13:14.837 --> 13:16.839
ya se habia calmado cuando
le metieron un balazo!

13:16.880 --> 13:20.133
Are they saying what
I think they're saying?

13:20.175 --> 13:23.345
"Policia hirieron
esos muchachos en la espalda"?

13:23.345 --> 13:26.348
Yeah. They claim they saw
the cops shoot the suspects

13:26.390 --> 13:27.349
in the back.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.350
Hey, not to mention

13:28.350 --> 13:29.852
there's an innocent kid
in the hospital.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.104
See? Another one they
killed! Where's his gun!

13:32.145 --> 13:34.022
Hey, let us do
our job here, okay?

13:34.064 --> 13:35.858
Mi hija vio a sus policias

13:35.858 --> 13:37.359
disparle a un nino
en la espalda.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.362
Senora, donde esta
su hija, huh?

13:40.404 --> 13:42.155
Queremos hablar con ella.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.866
La policia se la llevo.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.869
Usted vio algo de lo que paso?

13:46.910 --> 13:48.871
No?

13:48.871 --> 13:51.373
Nobody saw anything.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.875
I don't think this is police issue.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.377
Look, these folks were
suspicious of the cops

13:55.419 --> 13:56.879
long before this happened.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.380
Now, this is how your circle
stories get started.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.884
The story keeps changing till
you don't know what the truth is

14:01.925 --> 14:03.886
or whose story it was to begin with.

14:05.387 --> 14:11.393
So, uh... so the suspects saw
that we were kind of distracted

14:11.894 --> 14:15.898
helping Bell, and they
took the opportunity

14:15.939 --> 14:17.399
I went on foot pursuit,
you know.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.402
They, uh... I can't run
as fast as I used to,

14:20.444 --> 14:23.405
I mean,
so I lost them

14:23.405 --> 14:28.660
But that's when I heard
the... the two shots, I think.

14:28.702 --> 14:33.916
No. I don't know. I heard shots
coming from... the east.

14:33.957 --> 14:34.917
How many?

14:35.417 --> 14:37.419
Three.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.929
Four.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.430
And they sound

14:48.430 --> 14:50.933
a lot louder
than a nine-millimeter.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.438
The suspect had a gun
in his hand.

14:56.939 --> 14:57.940
Oh, yeah, definitely.

14:57.940 --> 14:58.941
I kicked it away
when I cuffed him.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.945
Did you fire any shots
in the alley?

15:02.986 --> 15:04.446
I didn't have to.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.949
Captain, hand over your firearm
to CSI Willows.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.455
Any magazines?

15:13.497 --> 15:14.456
Uh

15:18.961 --> 15:20.963
I must have used them.

15:27.970 --> 15:31.473
Captain Brass's service pistol

15:31.515 --> 15:34.518
was received
with an empty magazine

15:34.560 --> 15:37.479
and one live round
in the chamber.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.982
Well...

15:39.982 --> 15:40.983
It'd be smart to have ammo

15:41.483 --> 15:42.484
before you go running
into a gunfight.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.494
I didn't find any cartridge casings

15:52.536 --> 15:54.997
in this alley from
the dead guy's gun.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.499
Just these three
nine-millimeters from our cop.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.004
So he must have
been out of ammo.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.506
Yeah, but he had to know that
he'd get shot holding a gun

16:04.548 --> 16:06.049
whether it was loaded or not.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.509
Why didn't
he just toss it?

16:07.509 --> 16:09.511
Maybe he didn't know he was ou
Heat of the battle.

16:09.553 --> 16:10.512
I mean, we're not talking
rocket scientists.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.516
That doesn't make him suicidal,
though, does it?

16:26.528 --> 16:29.531
Sergeant Adams, I'm
sorry for your loss.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.534
If you'd like a few minu
tes to say good-bye...

16:57.059 --> 16:58.560
Okay, partner...

17:02.064 --> 17:04.566
I guess I was pretty
rough on you.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.069
Maybe not rough enough.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.575
You're the best rookie
I ever trained.

17:16.078 --> 17:20.082
I have to leave you now.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.585
I'll, uh, I'll talk to Tracy.

17:23.627 --> 17:27.589
Try to make her understand.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.091
Drop in on the kids.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.097
You were a good cop.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.106
Geraldo Zamesca.
High school football star.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.107
Full scholarship to USC.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.608
Got a bullet
lodged in his spine.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.610
Condition's critical.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.112
Can we get the bullet?

17:50.112 --> 17:53.615
Not unless his condition
improves or he dies.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.118
SWAT guys going house to
house breaking down doors.

17:56.618 --> 17:57.619
They're the ones
who found him.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.621
They're going to
blame us for this, too

17:59.663 --> 18:01.123
CSI's processed the scene?

18:01.623 --> 18:03.125
Yeah. Not
much to process.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.127
Some bloodstains
off the ground.

18:05.169 --> 18:07.129
Nine-millimeter
cartridge case

18:07.171 --> 18:10.132
Cops are shooting nines.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.633
Guilty until
proven innocent.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.636
This is my wife-
Geraldo's mother.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.138
We want nothing

18:16.138 --> 18:17.139
but the best for our son.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.390
That means we will
decide if you go in

18:18.432 --> 18:19.641
and get the bullet,
not the police.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.143
You got that?

18:24.646 --> 18:26.648
Kid's family?

18:26.690 --> 18:28.650
Yeah.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.653
Danilo Zamesca, a local businessman

18:31.653 --> 18:34.656
who lives in the 'hood,
but dines uptown.

18:37.659 --> 18:40.662
Perro porque la policia
le disparo aqui nuestra casa?

18:40.704 --> 18:42.164
Nosotros no hicimos nada.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.166
Porque la policia
nos disparo?

18:44.666 --> 18:47.169
I
- I'm sorry. I don't speak Spanish.

18:47.211 --> 18:49.171
Que... no entiende, que...

18:49.213 --> 18:50.172
Nos hubiera matado.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.674
Die algo para que ella
entienda.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.676
She wants to know why
our house got shot at.

18:59.681 --> 19:02.684
I don't have the answer to that.
I'm sorry.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.187
Es que usted no me puede
decir nada?

19:05.229 --> 19:06.188
No vio lo que hicieron?

19:06.688 --> 19:07.689
Que si fueran mis hijos?

19:07.689 --> 19:10.192
Que voy hacer
sin mis hijos?

19:33.215 --> 19:35.217
So, what do
you think that is?

19:35.259 --> 19:36.718
Well, it's not blood.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.220
It's not rust.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.222
Where did Grissom
find that?

19:40.722 --> 19:41.723
In an alley off Third.

19:42.224 --> 19:47.229
'Cause, see, those scrapes
and gauges look like road rash.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.231
Like when you toss a gun
out of a moving car.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
You'd be the one
to know about rashes.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.269
That's my brother, man!

20:27.311 --> 20:28.812
What'd hedo?!

20:28.854 --> 20:30.564
My baby! My baby!

20:30.606 --> 20:32.274
You killed my son!

20:32.316 --> 20:34.276
My baby!

20:34.276 --> 20:37.279
You cops murdered my son!

20:37.321 --> 20:38.280
Miss...

20:38.280 --> 20:40.282
You murdered my son!
Calm down, okay?

20:40.782 --> 20:43.785
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm with the Crime Lab.

20:43.827 --> 20:45.287
Talk to one of the
detectives. Miss..

20:45.329 --> 20:46.288
I don't need to!

20:46.288 --> 20:48.790
Look! Police brutality!
He's hitting me!

20:48.832 --> 20:49.791
Can I get some bac
kup here, please?

20:58.300 --> 20:59.801
Now you want my other son, huh?

20:59.843 --> 21:00.802
Is that what you want?

21:00.802 --> 21:02.804
I just want to do my job here.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.307
What? Lie for
the police department?

21:05.349 --> 21:06.808
Can we lock this place up

21:06.808 --> 21:08.810
and move that crime tape
down another block?

21:08.810 --> 21:10.812
Officer Mitchell,
come into the west alley.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.814
Bring two uniforms
with you.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.317
These people think, if they
catch us doing something wrong,

21:15.359 --> 21:16.818
they sue and win the lottery.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.320
Yeah. We don't do anything wrong,

21:18.362 --> 21:19.821
we got nothing
to worry about

21:27.871 --> 21:28.872
My son should
be in school today.

21:29.373 --> 21:30.833
He should be playing football.

21:30.874 --> 21:33.877
Instead, he's lying
in a hospital bed.

21:34.378 --> 21:36.338
Why?

21:36.380 --> 21:38.382
Because the cops decided
to shoot first

21:38.423 --> 21:39.341
and ask questions later.

21:39.383 --> 21:41.844
Anybody remember the last time

21:41.885 --> 21:44.888
the police had a running
gun battle down the Strip?

21:44.930 --> 21:47.391
No? That's 'cause
it's never happened.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.892
Summerlin? Never.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.894
Seven Hills?

21:50.936 --> 21:52.855
No way.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.898
But down here, hey...

21:56.400 --> 22:01.405
My son, Geraldo, was a good boy.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.408
He was a great football player.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.869
Fearless out there.

22:06.910 --> 22:11.415
He had a chance
to do something with his life.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.417
To be better than his father.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.377
Now...

22:15.419 --> 22:19.381
I may outlive my son

22:19.423 --> 22:22.384
because the police shot him

22:22.426 --> 22:26.430
before he could tell them
who he was.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.724
Before he could tell them

22:28.765 --> 22:30.893
he was an honor student.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.937
I want to invite everybody here
who cares about

22:33.979 --> 22:36.398
what happens in the community

22:36.440 --> 22:39.943
to come to Queen of Angels
tonight, 6:00 p. m.,

22:39.985 --> 22:42.946
to pray for Geraldo's life

22:43.447 --> 22:44.948
And I want to say

22:45.449 --> 22:48.452
out loud, right now,
to Sheriff Burdick,

22:48.952 --> 22:50.412
this will not stand.

22:50.454 --> 22:53.457
You, sir,
will be held to answer.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.920
I mean it.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.922
I'm not going away.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.466
A police spokesman confirms
that department officials

23:02.508 --> 23:04.259
are looking into all allegations

23:04.301 --> 23:05.928
of brutality and misconduct.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.971
Sheriff Burdick could not
be reached for comment.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.932
Here is what we know so far.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.976
er. Nobody gives a cra
p about a dead offic

23:13.018 --> 23:15.979
I don't see them
lighting candles for Bell.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.523
...this morning
with a car chase.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.024
The pursuit ended
in a shoot-out

23:19.066 --> 23:20.442
at Jefferson and Third Street

23:20.484 --> 23:23.946
between heavily-armed suspects
and police.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.989
Detective Curtis'
service pistol was received

23:26.490 --> 23:28.492
with one magazine containing
three live rounds

23:28.534 --> 23:30.285
and one live round

23:30.285 --> 23:31.954
in the chamber.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.497
During the gun battle,
were you aware

23:33.997 --> 23:37.251
of the other officers positions
relative to you?

23:37.292 --> 23:40.504
They were in front of me
and... and to my right.

23:40.546 --> 23:42.464
No, my left.

23:42.506 --> 23:44.508
Did you continue to be aware
of their positions

23:44.550 --> 23:46.510
after the susp ect took off running?

24:02.526 --> 24:03.986
Uh...

24:04.027 --> 24:07.531
Bell was in front of me...

24:08.031 --> 24:09.491
but he was down
behind his car.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.535
Do you remember Officer Bell
being shot?

24:30.554 --> 24:32.055
Um...

24:34.558 --> 24:37.519
Sorry. What was the question?

24:37.561 --> 24:40.564
I asked if you remember
Officer Bell being shot.

24:42.566 --> 24:44.067
Do you need a moment here?
No, no. That 's all right.

24:44.568 --> 24:45.569
She's going to do just fine.

24:45.611 --> 24:48.071
Uh...

24:52.576 --> 24:54.828
Make sure you check Bell's vest.

24:54.870 --> 24:57.080
I think he took one
in the chest.

24:59.583 --> 25:02.085
Detective Ortega, Catherine,
can you step out

25:02.127 --> 25:04.087
for a moment?

25:09.092 --> 25:10.594
We're not done.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.100
So how are we doing
on the suspect

25:17.142 --> 25:18.101
that got away?

25:18.602 --> 25:19.561
Jose Fausto.

25:19.603 --> 25:21.104
Identified through
prints in their car.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.105
He's got a long rap sheet.

25:22.147 --> 25:23.106
Dogs lost his scent.

25:23.607 --> 25:25.609
SWAT guys checked
the building- nothing.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.569
Gang unit's beating the bushes

25:27.611 --> 25:30.113
Word on the street is
we shot two unarmed men

25:30.155 --> 25:31.615
and a high school kid.

25:31.657 --> 25:32.574
We got I
Ds

25:32.616 --> 25:34.076
of all three dead suspects.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.119
Multiple felonies,
drugs, immigration violations.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.121
They're all members
of the 18th Street Chucos.

25:38.163 --> 25:39.665
Also driving
a stolen car,

25:39.706 --> 25:41.124
shooting automatic
weapons

25:41.166 --> 25:42.626
at a police car.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.586
These guys aren't
exactly altar boys.

25:44.628 --> 25:47.631
West alley, I got eyewitnesses
saw po-po plant the gun.

25:47.673 --> 25:49.591
East alley, I got an old lady
who swears

25:49.633 --> 25:51.134
she saw Ricardo Estevez
with his hands raised

25:51.635 --> 25:52.886
before he was killed.

25:52.928 --> 25:54.137
These witnesses credible?

25:54.179 --> 25:55.597
I don't know.

25:55.639 --> 25:57.099
Listen,
if the suspects

25:57.140 --> 25:58.642
don't have guns
in their hands,

25:58.684 --> 25:59.643
we can't shoot them.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.645
Well, let's not get ahead
of the evidence.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.105
Okay, one more thing.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.648
The family of Leandro Chavez

26:05.148 --> 26:06.650
is suing the department
for wrongful death.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.652
Claims we dela
yed treatment.

26:22.666 --> 26:25.127
Medium caliber bullet.

26:25.169 --> 26:27.171
Transected the
femoral artery

26:27.212 --> 26:29.173
Major artery. Fatal wound.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.678
Take a look. What's missing?

26:36.680 --> 26:40.184
All the organs seem
to be in the right place.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.186
Look closer.

26:42.227 --> 26:43.687
Okay.

26:44.688 --> 26:46.440
Kidneys are...

26:46.481 --> 26:48.150
a bit pale.

26:48.192 --> 26:49.193
Liver is light tan.

26:49.234 --> 26:50.652
Right.

26:50.694 --> 26:52.196
Not a lot of blood.

26:54.198 --> 26:55.699
Dead at the scene.

26:55.741 --> 26:56.700
He bled out.

26:56.742 --> 26:58.160
Bingo.

26:58.202 --> 27:00.204
The wound was not
immediately fatal.

27:00.245 --> 27:01.663
It took awhile.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.457
This is going to look bad.

27:03.499 --> 27:05.209
David, it is what it is.

27:12.216 --> 27:14.218
Why did you le ave a downed officer?

27:17.221 --> 27:21.725
Sergeant Adams told me he had
the situation under control.

27:21.767 --> 27:24.228
So I went

27:24.728 --> 27:27.231
to back up Officer Davis,
who ran off in...

27:27.731 --> 27:29.233
this direction.

27:29.733 --> 27:31.235
I caught up with him here.

27:35.239 --> 27:37.741
Davis' slide was locked back

27:37.783 --> 27:39.201
He was out of ammo.

27:39.243 --> 27:42.746
So the suspect had a gun
pointed at Officer Davis.

27:48.252 --> 27:50.254
Of course.

27:53.257 --> 27:54.758
That was why I fired.

28:00.264 --> 28:01.765
100% sure?

28:03.267 --> 28:05.769
Yes.

28:06.270 --> 28:07.271
What did you do next?

28:10.274 --> 28:11.275
What are you doing?
Put it down.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.777
Yeah. Sorry. I was just trying
to secure his gun.

28:13.819 --> 28:15.279
He's not going
to be using it anymore.

28:15.779 --> 28:18.282
Officer Davis was acting
on survival instinct,

28:18.323 --> 28:20.742
not training.

28:20.784 --> 28:25.789
It was understandable
under these circumstances.

28:26.290 --> 28:28.292
I don't think so.

28:50.814 --> 28:53.275
Want a ride?

28:53.317 --> 28:57.321
No. I'm just going
to go home.

28:57.362 --> 28:59.615
You sure?

28:59.615 --> 29:01.825
Yeah.

30:05.389 --> 30:07.391
Okay, the first
communication I received

30:07.432 --> 30:13.397
from Three-David-3
4 was at 0643:37.

30:13.897 --> 30:16.400
This is Three-David-34
requesting immediate backup.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.360
New suspect vehicle:

30:18.402 --> 30:21.155
Adam-Robert-Charlie-208, Nevada.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.907
Dark Chevy Caprice.
Four suspects.

30:23.949 --> 30:24.908
Suspects are armed.

30:25.409 --> 30:26.869
Copy, Three-David-34.

30:26.910 --> 30:29.413
What did Bell mean
by "new suspect vehicle"?

30:29.454 --> 30:31.915
Can you take it back
to the last communication

30:31.957 --> 30:33.876
before that call?

30:33.917 --> 30:36.920
Control, this is Three-David-34.

30:37.421 --> 30:40.674
We'll be 487,
12000 block of Roosevelt

30:40.716 --> 30:43.927
on David-Nora-Charlie-130.
Buick Regal.

30:46.430 --> 30:48.390
A 487

30:48.432 --> 30:49.391
is a traffic stop.

30:49.433 --> 30:50.434
You were pulling over
a Buick?

30:50.475 --> 30:51.894
That's correct.

30:51.935 --> 30:53.437
Why did you leave the Buick
and start following the Caprice?

30:53.478 --> 30:54.938
Didn't leave the Buick.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.939
The Caprice cut in.

31:00.444 --> 31:01.945
ow. Why'd he do that? Don't kn

31:02.446 --> 31:04.448
Next thing I know,
we were taking fire.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.450
Forgot all about the Buick.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.452
Did you see
where it went?

31:08.494 --> 31:09.953
I was kind of busy.

31:19.463 --> 31:24.426
Hey, you done yet?

31:24.468 --> 31:27.471
Grissom, am I on overtime?

31:27.513 --> 31:29.431
Of course.

31:29.473 --> 31:30.974
Did everyone else go home?

31:31.016 --> 31:31.934
No.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.435
Good to know.

31:33.477 --> 31:36.980
Well, I finished
about ten blocks so far.

31:37.022 --> 31:40.943
That's 98
cartridge cases.

31:40.984 --> 31:43.487
Let's see- double L,
A to Z's 26,

31:43.529 --> 31:45.989
That's 38 bullet impacts

31:46.031 --> 31:46.949
Good.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.992
Pursuit started ten blocks
farther down.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.452
You're halfway done.

31:50.494 --> 31:52.996
I've got, like, three or four
hours' more work left.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.790
Can I have some help?

31:54.790 --> 31:56.166
Everybody's busy.

31:56.208 --> 31:57.501
I think you missed one.

32:09.513 --> 32:10.514
Grissom.

32:10.556 --> 32:11.473
Hey.

32:11.515 --> 32:12.975
I just interviewed
Sergeant Adams.

32:13.016 --> 32:15.018
He and Bell were making
a routine traffic stop

32:15.060 --> 32:16.311
when the Caprice cut in.

32:16.311 --> 32:17.521
The initial vehicle was a...

32:17.563 --> 32:18.522
A Buick?

32:19.022 --> 32:20.524
I hate it when you do that.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.526
Lucky guess.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.528
I'll call you back.

32:26.530 --> 32:29.032
How'd you know that
hubcap was connected to the case?

32:29.074 --> 32:31.034
I'm a trained
observer, Greg.

32:31.076 --> 32:32.494
No, really.

32:32.536 --> 32:36.039
How long do you think a
perfectly good hubcap like this

32:36.081 --> 32:37.583
would sit around out here?

32:37.583 --> 32:39.042
There's a freeway
on-ramp

32:39.543 --> 32:40.502
about two blocks away.

32:40.544 --> 32:42.045
Check and see if there's
any traffic cams

32:42.087 --> 32:43.005
between here and there.

32:43.046 --> 32:45.048
You know,
you scare me sometimes.

32:45.549 --> 32:47.301
It's kind of freaky.

32:47.342 --> 32:49.052
You ever bet on the ponies?

32:49.094 --> 32:50.053
I prefer poker.

32:50.554 --> 32:51.555
Horses are hard to control.

32:54.558 --> 32:57.561
Make sure you document
these skid marks.

32:57.603 --> 32:59.062
He said "skid marks. "

33:04.568 --> 33:06.528
Oh-ho-ho! Yeah!

33:06.570 --> 33:08.071
out.
That's what I'm talking ab

33:08.572 --> 33:10.574
I got over firing AK's
a long time ago.

33:16.079 --> 33:18.582
Hey... Mustache Boy,
come over here

33:18.624 --> 33:21.084
and check this out

33:23.086 --> 33:24.087
Get a load of that

33:27.591 --> 33:30.594
Whoa.

33:31.094 --> 33:33.597
What are the chances of that
happening? Like one in a million.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.561
The bullet jam
med this cylinder.

33:39.603 --> 33:42.606
You know, I couldn't clear
this gun at the scene.

33:42.648 --> 33:44.107
I should've noticed
these bullet fragments.

33:44.149 --> 33:45.609
I guess I got distracted.

33:46.109 --> 33:49.613
Well, the bullet had to come
from Officer Davis' pistol.

33:49.655 --> 33:51.573
But, if you're the suspect,

33:51.615 --> 33:54.076
don't you know
your gun's getting hit?

33:54.117 --> 33:57.120
I think it would have fe
It like a normal recoil.

33:57.162 --> 33:58.622
Besides, it was like

33:59.122 --> 34:00.123
the Wild West
out there.

34:00.624 --> 34:03.126
You don't have to tell me.
I know it was crazy out there.

34:03.168 --> 34:06.129
You know, I pulled 78 bullets
out of one car.

34:06.171 --> 34:09.132
Davis just got lucky.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.635
This suspect had
one live round left.

34:11.677 --> 34:13.428
It saved Davis' life.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.097
Well, there you go.

34:15.138 --> 34:17.891
Proves he was pointing the gun
at the officer.

34:17.933 --> 34:20.561
See you in court.
Stroke one up for the good guys.

34:20.561 --> 34:23.146
We still have to place it
in Rosario's hand.

34:29.152 --> 34:32.156
This is Gil Grissom
from the Crime Lab.

34:32.197 --> 34:34.616
This is
Officer Bell's wife.

34:34.658 --> 34:36.659
Mrs. Bell, I'm so
sorry about the loss

34:37.161 --> 34:38.661
of your husband.
He was a fine ma

34:41.165 --> 34:43.625
Why are they crying?

34:43.667 --> 34:46.128
Um, why don't
I drive you home

34:46.170 --> 34:49.172
They're crying for the
man that killed my husband.

34:49.214 --> 34:50.632
What did you say? You heardme.

34:50.674 --> 34:53.677
If you did a better jo b of raising
your son, I wouldn't be here.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.679
Don't you tell me how to raise
my children! You should be ashamed!

34:58.682 --> 34:59.183
How dare you!

35:42.226 --> 35:43.727
You run the gauntlet?

35:43.769 --> 35:46.188
Yeah.

35:46.230 --> 35:48.232
Ferro-tracing his hands?

35:48.273 --> 35:49.191
Yeah.

35:49.233 --> 35:50.734
I'm trying to prove Rosario here

35:51.235 --> 35:52.194
held the gun.

35:52.236 --> 35:55.197
Good old
pyridyldiphenyl triazine.

35:55.239 --> 35:57.741
I'm hoping this stuff reac
ts to the traces of iron

35:57.783 --> 35:59.284
that may have been
left on his skin

35:59.284 --> 36:00.744
It'll further refute any argument

36:00.786 --> 36:02.246
that the gun
was a plant.

36:07.251 --> 36:08.752
That could be the back strap

36:08.794 --> 36:10.212
of a gun.

36:10.254 --> 36:13.757
Yeah. That would do it

36:19.263 --> 36:21.723
Detective,
do you have a moment?

36:21.765 --> 36:24.268
Uh, yeah. I'm kind
of busy. What is it?

36:24.309 --> 36:26.061
I picked up a junkie
for possession

36:26.061 --> 36:27.771
outside a fleabag motel
off Fremont.

36:27.813 --> 36:29.231
And what?

36:29.273 --> 36:31.775
And... last night,
he spotted your shooter.

36:37.281 --> 36:39.783
him.
Let's talk to

36:43.287 --> 36:44.788
You know this guy?

36:44.830 --> 36:45.747
What if I do?

36:45.789 --> 36:48.750
What'll it get me?

36:48.792 --> 36:50.794
He's a cop killer.
Gets you nothing.

36:51.295 --> 36:53.255
Hey, no need to get hostile.

36:53.297 --> 36:55.299
Hey, man, you don't
know what hostile is.

36:57.801 --> 37:00.053
Will it at least
get me a ride home?

37:00.095 --> 37:02.264
Come on...
Okay, okay.

37:02.306 --> 37:05.309
I- I do a lot of business
at the Lucky Seven Motel.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.811
And that guy checked in
last night.

37:08.312 --> 37:11.815
He scored a little something
to help get him some sleep.

37:12.316 --> 37:14.276
But he didn't pay.

37:14.318 --> 37:16.320
He just flashed his piece.

37:16.361 --> 37:17.321
Nine-millimeter?

37:17.362 --> 37:18.780
Yeah.

37:18.822 --> 37:22.075
He wanted a... a girl,

37:22.117 --> 37:24.745
and I gave him a number.

37:24.745 --> 37:27.331
That dude's bad news.

37:29.333 --> 37:30.834
I want to give him to you.

37:32.836 --> 37:34.296
Glad you're here.

37:34.338 --> 37:36.840
I'd like to get th
is one off my table.

37:36.882 --> 37:38.800
Found a rather large

37:38.842 --> 37:40.844
contusion on the left chest

37:40.886 --> 37:41.845
just below the nipple.

37:42.346 --> 37:43.597
Well, that location
is consistent

37:43.639 --> 37:44.806
with the bullet Catherine found

37:44.848 --> 37:47.351
embedded in his vest. It's
like ge tting kicked by a mule.

37:47.392 --> 37:48.852
You'll want to see this.

37:48.894 --> 37:51.355
Through-and-through.

37:51.855 --> 37:54.358
Entrance wound just
below his left ear,

37:54.399 --> 37:56.360
exited below
and to the front

37:56.860 --> 37:58.862
of his right ear, severing
the right common carotid

38:02.366 --> 38:03.867
That's your C.O.D.

38:03.909 --> 38:05.327
Fortunately,

38:05.369 --> 38:07.371
he never felt a thing.

38:09.873 --> 38:13.377
Left to right, back to front.

38:13.418 --> 38:14.378
Mm-hmm.

38:14.878 --> 38:17.381
Only cops were shooting
in that direction.

38:17.422 --> 38:19.883
Are you saying Bell was hit
by friendly fire?

38:19.925 --> 38:21.885
Maybe not so friendly.

38:41.905 --> 38:42.865
Who's in the room?

38:42.906 --> 38:44.408
Some john. I don't know.
Shh!

38:44.449 --> 38:46.869
Is that him?
Mm-hmm.

38:46.910 --> 38:48.912
I couldn't wait
to get out of there.

38:48.954 --> 38:50.914
He was acting real nervous.

38:51.415 --> 38:52.875
Now I know why.

38:52.916 --> 38:54.918
I took care of him.
He's asleep.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.920
So you're not gonna
bustme,right?

38:56.962 --> 38:58.422
Get her out of here.

39:03.427 --> 39:04.928
Police! Let me see your hands!

39:04.970 --> 39:05.888
Do it now!

39:05.929 --> 39:07.431
Get on the floor!

39:07.472 --> 39:08.432
Down!

39:14.438 --> 39:16.940
That's our guy.

39:24.948 --> 39:26.950
He's carrying a nine.

39:26.992 --> 39:27.951
Clear.

39:30.454 --> 39:32.956
We'll run this gun
against the cartridge case

39:32.998 --> 39:34.458
from that poor kid on the bike.

39:34.958 --> 39:37.461
I'm guessing you didn't
save up for that one, huh?

39:41.965 --> 39:44.968
You shoot an innocent kid in
the back just to take his bike?

39:45.010 --> 39:46.929
You piece of crap!
Get up!

39:46.970 --> 39:48.972
Hey, you're gonna
wish you kept running.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.432
They hate cop killers

39:50.474 --> 39:51.934
uh? in Vegas, you hear me? H

39:51.975 --> 39:54.436
Come on, let me get
dressed up first, huh?

39:54.478 --> 39:56.980
We got a jumpsuit
just your size. Don't worry.

40:06.990 --> 40:07.991
Suspect coming through.
