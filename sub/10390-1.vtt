- [Jimbo] Come on,
dude, take it easy.

08:48.631 --> 08:50.012
- [Mike] He's a fuckin' asshole.

08:50.012 --> 08:51.254
- [Jimbo] What the Hell, Mike.

08:51.254 --> 08:52.532
- [TC] You're
fucking crazy, man.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.809
- All right, you
know what, fuck it.

08:53.809 --> 08:55.051
Fuck it, go ahead.

08:55.051 --> 08:56.397
Go ahead, that's what
you want, Mikey, fight.

08:56.397 --> 08:57.571
Kick his ass, TC.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.400
- [TC] What do you mean?

08:59.400 --> 09:00.540
- [Jimbo] Fuck him up, TC.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.818
Hit him in the mouth.

09:02.818 --> 09:04.198
- All right, fuck it,
all right, come on.

09:04.198 --> 09:06.028
I don't give a shit, fuck it.

09:06.028 --> 09:08.720
This is how you wanna be,
man, fuck it, come on.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.273
I'm not afraid of
your ass, come on.

09:10.273 --> 09:12.034
- I forgive ya, fuck it.

09:15.037 --> 09:16.107
You fuckin' believe this guy?

09:16.107 --> 09:17.315
He was gonna hit me.

09:17.315 --> 09:18.385
- You should fuckin'
hit him anyway.

09:18.385 --> 09:19.317
- You forgive me?

09:19.317 --> 09:20.560
- You know, you got problems.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.975
- [Jimbo] He should
have fuckin' hit you.

09:21.975 --> 09:22.907
- [Dez] You had it comin'
to you, you jackass.

09:22.907 --> 09:24.322
- You got problems with rage.

09:24.322 --> 09:25.772
Startin' that much trouble
your first day back.

09:25.772 --> 09:27.739
- Dez, what do you say you
get TC a beer right away, huh?

09:27.739 --> 09:29.258
- [Dez] I'm on it.

09:29.258 --> 09:31.053
- It's good to see some
things don't change, huh?

09:31.053 --> 09:32.330
- Welcome home, brother.

09:32.330 --> 09:41.028
Come on, shoot a little pool.

09:44.791 --> 09:47.448
- [Mike] I don't understand
the New York Jets.

09:47.448 --> 09:50.693
They always play
in Giants Stadium.

09:50.693 --> 09:52.246
- All right, here we go boys.

09:52.246 --> 09:53.385
- But don't they have
their own stadium.

09:53.385 --> 09:54.732
- My bar, listen up.

09:54.732 --> 09:56.423
We finish this
bottle, we go home.

09:56.423 --> 09:57.976
But first,
[vocalizations of agreement]

09:57.976 --> 09:59.529
real quick,
[Mike babbles obnoxiously]

09:59.529 --> 10:02.084
to TC, hey, shut it,
to TC coming home.

10:02.084 --> 10:03.326
- [Paulie] Yeah, what am I?

10:03.326 --> 10:04.569
- [Dez] And the band
gettin' back together.

10:04.569 --> 10:06.053
- [Paulie] Hey,
Dez, Dez, come on.

10:06.053 --> 10:07.537
- [Jimbo and Dez] And Paulie.

10:07.537 --> 10:09.263
- [TC] And all you guys.

10:09.263 --> 10:14.268
[group chatter]

10:14.337 --> 10:16.408
- [Jimbo] Mike, Mike.
- [Dez] Drink up, cuz.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.307
- [Jimbo] Come
on, it's bad luck.

10:20.758 --> 10:22.898
[all sigh in contentment]

10:22.898 --> 10:25.176
- Is there more,
yeah, there you go.

10:25.176 --> 10:29.249
[drunken exclamations
and laughter]

10:29.249 --> 10:31.113
[someone shushes]

10:32.977 --> 10:35.427
- [Jimbo] Whoa, where's my car?

10:35.427 --> 10:37.119
[drunken exclamations]

10:37.119 --> 10:38.845
- [Paulie] Jimbo, Jimbo,
you're not driving anywhere.

10:38.845 --> 10:40.640
- [TC] You don't need a car
now, you got a ride already.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.917
Look at that.

10:41.917 --> 10:43.608
- [Mike] Just get on my back.

10:43.608 --> 10:45.092
- [Jimbo] No,
seriously, I'll drive.

10:45.092 --> 10:46.266
- [Mike] You're not
drivin' anywhere.

10:46.266 --> 10:47.577
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

10:47.577 --> 10:49.027
- [TC] No, come on, man,
we'll walk, we'll walk.

10:49.027 --> 10:50.719
It's just a couple of
blocks, what's the big deal?

10:50.719 --> 10:51.996
- [Mike] I'm not walking
with you anywhere.

10:51.996 --> 10:53.549
- [TC] Whatever,
Seaver. Whatever.

10:53.549 --> 10:54.550
- [Paulie] I thought you guys
made up, didn't you make up?

10:54.550 --> 10:56.069
You made up right?

10:57.346 --> 10:58.623
You made up.

10:58.623 --> 11:00.487
- [Dez] Hey, hey, hey,
hey, that's my trash.

11:00.487 --> 11:01.902
[giggling]
Hey, hey, hey come on.

11:01.902 --> 11:03.179
- [Jimbo] Just like
The Highlander.

11:03.179 --> 11:04.318
- Put it back.

11:04.318 --> 11:05.768
[Jimbo makes obnoxious
vocalization]

11:05.768 --> 11:07.736
[bottles clank and crash]
That's my trash, dude.

11:07.736 --> 11:09.013
What's your problem?

11:09.013 --> 11:10.048
- [Mike] There he is,
in the Olympic sport--

11:10.048 --> 11:11.325
- [Dez] Get out of here.

11:11.325 --> 11:12.775
- [Paulie] What the
fuck are you doing?

11:12.775 --> 11:13.845
- [Dez] That's great.

11:13.845 --> 11:15.364
- [Paulie] Hey, hey, hey.

11:15.364 --> 11:16.917
All right, all right, maybe
we got to settle down, Jimbo.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.608
- [Mike] Letting derelicts
drink after hours.

11:18.608 --> 11:20.680
They should shut you down, Dez.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.511
[guys all chatter]
- [Dez] Fuck you, bitch.

11:24.511 --> 11:27.687
- [Paulie] Dez, Dez,
Dez, seriously, what
are we going to do

11:27.687 --> 11:30.172
for the rehearsal dinner?

11:30.172 --> 11:31.760
[boisterous yelling]
- [Dez] We have one song.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.141
All right, I think
if we get that tight,

11:34.141 --> 11:36.005
if we work at it long and hard

11:36.005 --> 11:40.492
[loud boisterous yelling]
[guys chatter]

11:40.492 --> 11:43.185
- Why don't you wanna go
fishing, it'll be fun.

11:43.185 --> 11:44.807
- [Jimbo] You're not comin', TC?

11:44.807 --> 11:46.395
- There's a fine
line between fishing

11:46.395 --> 11:48.708
and standing in the boat looking
like an idiot, all right?

11:48.708 --> 11:51.227
- Come on, don't leave me
hangin', man, I feel like shit.

11:52.297 --> 11:54.714
- Jimmy, he just wants
to spend time with you.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.406
It's the least you
could do as his brother.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.067
Just be nice to him, okay?

12:03.067 --> 12:06.035
And remember, don't say anything
about Sue, you promised.

12:06.035 --> 12:12.973
- Come on, baby, have a
little faith in me, all right?

12:16.943 --> 12:18.530
- You know, I purposely
didn't go fishin',

12:18.530 --> 12:20.498
'cause I know you need to talk.

12:20.498 --> 12:22.914
- So talk, what's goin' on?

12:22.914 --> 12:26.055
- Come on, you've got some
sense of what's going on.

12:26.055 --> 12:28.989
- I'm tellin' you, he's got
this edge, this ridiculous edge.

12:28.989 --> 12:31.681
I mean, how long's
he been in this funk?

12:31.681 --> 12:32.682
- It's been this way

12:32.682 --> 12:34.167
about a year.
- [TC] A year?

12:34.167 --> 12:35.444
- I mean, did he tell you he
got fired again last week?

12:35.444 --> 12:36.514
- [TC] What do you mean, again?

12:36.514 --> 12:39.137
- Second job in ten months.

12:39.137 --> 12:40.449
You knew him years ago,

12:40.449 --> 12:41.968
is he the type of
guy that gets fired?

12:41.968 --> 12:43.590
- All right, look, have
you tried just being direct

12:43.590 --> 12:45.903
and saying, "Jimbo, what
the fuck is goin' on?"

12:45.903 --> 12:47.352
- Come on, I've
tried everything.

12:47.352 --> 12:49.907
I've tried couples counseling,
I've tired his father.

12:49.907 --> 12:52.288
Nothing, he won't
talk to anyone.

12:52.288 --> 12:53.773
And he's getting fat too.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.222
- Oh, yeah, that I noticed.

12:55.222 --> 12:58.156
- I mean, he thinks it's funny
that he's let himself go.

12:58.156 --> 13:00.745
He says now that he's
married, why bother.

13:00.745 --> 13:02.747
- Well, you know, that's what
happens when you get to 35.

13:02.747 --> 13:04.024
You think you got
your head together,

13:04.024 --> 13:05.923
and then all the sudden
your body falls apart.

13:05.923 --> 13:08.511
- Yeah, well his head
is hardly together.

13:08.511 --> 13:13.171
[soft guitar music]

13:17.037 --> 13:20.316
- [Jimbo] I gotta hand
it to you, bro. [laughs]

13:20.316 --> 13:22.663
You figured it
out, man, you know.

13:22.663 --> 13:25.908
You got a nice
house, great boat.

13:25.908 --> 13:27.358
all the time to enjoy it.

13:27.358 --> 13:30.430
- Hey, look, I only fish before
or after work, all right.

13:30.430 --> 13:31.949
Today's an exception,

13:31.949 --> 13:34.054
because I wanted to spend
time with my big brother.

13:34.054 --> 13:37.644
- [laughs] Wait a minute,
you call what you do work?

13:37.644 --> 13:39.784
Shit, if I had to type for
a couple of hours every day,

13:39.784 --> 13:42.373
yeah, I'd have plenty
of energy to fish.

13:42.373 --> 13:44.685
- Wait, you're gonna try
and tell me that the reason

13:44.685 --> 13:46.377
you just go home and
watch TV every night

13:46.377 --> 13:48.724
is because you're too tired
from sellin' office supplies?

13:48.724 --> 13:52.210
- I'm not a salesman,
I'm the general manager.

13:52.210 --> 13:53.625
Okay, there's big difference.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.144
I've got 15 people
underneath me.

13:55.144 --> 13:56.594
- Yeah, Jimbo.

13:56.594 --> 13:58.182
I've seen that pack of
misfits that work under you.

13:58.182 --> 13:59.873
- Jesus Christ, come
on, Paulie, seriously.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.530
Do not try and compare
what you do for a living

14:01.530 --> 14:03.497
with what I do for a living,
'cause there's no comparison.

14:03.497 --> 14:04.740
I do a man's work, okay.

14:04.740 --> 14:07.191
I have to oversee
multiple locations.

14:07.191 --> 14:10.850
I've got shipping,
inventory, I've got trucks.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.060
So when I come home,
I'm tired, all right?

14:14.060 --> 14:16.096
I'm not doin' what you
do, what do you do?

14:16.096 --> 14:17.684
You sit in front of the
computer for a half an hour?

14:17.684 --> 14:19.203
An hour?

14:19.203 --> 14:20.860
So you have the free time
to jog and to lift weights

14:20.860 --> 14:22.206
and to fish and do
all that fun shit

14:22.206 --> 14:24.139
that you seem to
have all day to do.

14:24.139 --> 14:25.934
- All right, I see
what you're sayin'.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.901
So, you think the reason

14:27.901 --> 14:30.593
that you've packed on a
couple of pounds lately

14:30.593 --> 14:33.942
is because you don't have
the time to work out anymore.

14:33.942 --> 14:35.840
- What other reason
would there be?

14:35.840 --> 14:37.255
- I don't know.

14:37.255 --> 14:39.464
Maybe it's the 12 pack of
Budweiser a night, I don't know.

14:39.464 --> 14:41.432
- Jesus Christ, l
work a long day.

14:41.432 --> 14:42.916
I don't have time to exercise,

14:42.916 --> 14:45.574
but I enjoy a few
cocktails, okay?

14:45.574 --> 14:46.886
If you knew what I went through,

14:46.886 --> 14:49.371
the pressures I was
under, the deadlines,

14:49.371 --> 14:53.375
you wouldn't begrudge
me a fuckin' drink.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.032
All right, I didn't
get lucky, man, okay.

14:55.032 --> 14:58.794
I did not marry a rich girl.

15:02.660 --> 15:05.559
Fuckin', I'll hand it
to you, you got lucky.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.528
You know, I didn't want
to get into it with you,

15:08.528 --> 15:09.770
you know what I'm
sayin', Paulie?

15:09.770 --> 15:12.463
I just, I'm worried
about you, that's all.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.051
- What the hell are
you worried about?

15:14.051 --> 15:16.432
- You're gettin' married.

15:16.432 --> 15:18.158
- Jimbo, we've been living
together for a couple of years.

15:18.158 --> 15:19.711
You know, I think it's
gonna be all right.

15:19.711 --> 15:22.128
- It's different when you
get married, trust me.

15:22.128 --> 15:24.924
You know, I just don't wanna
see you makin' a mistake.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.996
- We got a baby comin' in a
couple of months, all right.

15:27.996 --> 15:30.239
It's a little too late to
worry about that, all right?

15:30.239 --> 15:31.723
- Hey look, I know, I know.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.173
You don't have to get
married to someone

15:33.173 --> 15:34.795
just 'cause you
got them pregnant.

15:34.795 --> 15:36.038
I mean, it's not the '50s.

15:36.038 --> 15:37.315
No one's puttin' a
gun to your head.

15:37.315 --> 15:39.076
- I'm marrying her,
because I love her.

15:39.076 --> 15:40.422
Is that so hard to believe?

15:40.422 --> 15:41.492
- No, of course, l
know you love her.

15:41.492 --> 15:43.011
And you're a good guy, I mean,

15:43.011 --> 15:44.426
you're the kind of guy who's
always done the right thing.

15:44.426 --> 15:46.048
It's just, it's not
necessarily the right thing

15:46.048 --> 15:47.291
to get married to someone

15:47.291 --> 15:49.086
just 'cause you got them
pregnant, that's all.

15:49.086 --> 15:55.678
I just don't wanna see you
makin' some huge mistake.

16:00.131 --> 16:01.374
- Hey, Dez.

16:01.374 --> 16:05.757
Rehearsal, one
hour, in my garage.

16:05.757 --> 16:14.801
- That is the commitment
I like to see, cuz.

16:18.736 --> 16:19.806
- [Voiceover] What
are you talking about?

16:19.806 --> 16:21.739
It's Nirvana all the way, dude.

16:21.739 --> 16:22.878
- Yo.

16:24.638 --> 16:26.192
Do you see me
unloading the minivan?

16:26.192 --> 16:27.779
- Aw, come on, dad,
we're going to Murph's.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.264
We're gonna be late.

16:29.264 --> 16:30.541
- You're gonna be more late
if you don't get your butt

16:30.541 --> 16:32.508
off the bike and help
me unload the minivan.

16:32.508 --> 16:34.959
- We have to be there
in five minutes, dad.

16:34.959 --> 16:37.824
- [feigns shock] You gotta be
there in five minutes, huh?

16:37.824 --> 16:40.482
Well, let me ask you
a real quick question.

16:41.759 --> 16:43.933
Who likes the
delicious Fruit Loops?

16:43.933 --> 16:45.142
Oh, you do?

16:45.142 --> 16:46.384
That's good.

16:46.384 --> 16:48.041
How about the little
fudgie-fudgies?

16:48.041 --> 16:49.663
You like these?

16:51.044 --> 16:52.701

That's fine with me,
Jen, I don't give a shit.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.049

26:08.049 --> 26:09.188
Fine.

Hey, Jimbo.

27:28.060 --> 27:30.683
Jimbo, what was that
song you wrote for Jules

27:30.683 --> 27:32.098
when you were trying to
woo her in High School.

27:32.098 --> 27:33.341
What was it?

27:33.341 --> 27:35.032
- [Jules] Woo me, is
that what you call it?

27:35.032 --> 27:37.552
He had ulterior motives
if I remember correctly.

27:37.552 --> 27:39.278
- Remember that song
you wrote for her.

27:39.278 --> 27:41.452
Back when you were trying to,

you know what I mean.

play all the time.

28:01.196 --> 28:03.647

all heavy, I can't drive.

28:48.899 --> 28:50.176
'Cause every song
I hear on the radio

28:50.176 --> 28:51.695

And then, I know I shouldn't
go over there and see her,

28:54.008 --> 28:56.493
but I can't help myself, I
gotta see her with my own eyes.

28:56.493 --> 28:59.565

you gotta calm down, man.

28:59.565 --> 29:01.049
I mean, there are
other women out there.

29:01.049 --> 29:02.879
Just give yourself time, and
you'll meet somebody new.

Paulie, she's so hot.

29:09.609 --> 29:11.577
That's a combo in

when I met Sue,

29:17.479 --> 29:21.138
she was kinda going through
what you're going through now.

29:21.138 --> 29:24.003

clown from Staten Island.

29:24.003 --> 29:25.246
When I was workin' over there,

29:25.246 --> 29:27.144
I'd see her on the
ferry occasionally.

29:27.144 --> 29:31.493
And one night, I'm comin' back.

29:31.493 --> 29:34.600
And I see her, and she's crying.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.810
You know, so, I go over to her.

29:37.810 --> 29:40.399
You know, and being the
nice cordial guy that I am.

29:40.399 --> 29:42.366
I ask how she's doin',
and she tells me the story

29:42.366 --> 29:43.747
about how she just found out

29:43.747 --> 29:45.991
that her boyfriend
was cheatin' on her.

29:46.854 --> 29:51.168
So I walked her home
and asked her, you know,

29:51.168 --> 29:52.445
maybe when she's feeling better,

29:52.445 --> 29:54.689
maybe she let's me take her out.

29:54.689 --> 29:56.691
Maybe, you know,

29:56.691 --> 29:59.142
maybe let me make
somethin' in her life.

29:59.142 --> 30:01.592

30:01.592 --> 30:03.974

how you guys met,

30:08.185 --> 30:10.394

30:10.394 --> 30:11.913
That's romantic, Paulie.

30:11.913 --> 30:12.914
- Yeah, yeah.

30:12.914 --> 30:14.882
- Like, that's really romantic.

30:14.882 --> 30:17.022

told me that before?

30:18.506 --> 30:20.025

doesn't come up, does it?

30:24.892 --> 30:27.687
- [Sue] What about
Violet, I like that.

30:27.687 --> 30:28.896
That could be a good name.

30:28.896 --> 30:30.690
- No, no flowers.

30:30.690 --> 30:33.486
And no virtuous names either,
like Hope, Faith or Chastity.

30:33.486 --> 30:36.386
She should have a regular
name like Liz or Betty.

30:36.386 --> 30:38.629
- Liz or Betty?

30:38.629 --> 30:42.357

are the same name, right?

30:42.357 --> 30:45.015
They're both nicknames
for Elizabeth.

know that. [chuckles softly]

to check out her personality

painting her room?

sickness or something.

me, with real disgust,

36:43.304 --> 36:44.892
"Be safe."

36:48.240 --> 36:50.484
Yeah, and that was
it, man, that was it.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.728
That was it.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.593
- Hey, Dez.

36:56.593 --> 36:58.906
Can we talk for a second
about what a stupid idea it is

36:58.906 --> 37:01.598
to have a softball game
for a bachelor party?

37:01.598 --> 37:03.290
I mean, come on.

37:03.290 --> 37:05.223
What the hell is that all about?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.431
You know what we
should be doin'?

37:06.431 --> 37:07.673
- [Dez] Yeah,
playin' basketball.

37:07.673 --> 37:09.123
- No, man, we should
be gettin' a limo

37:09.123 --> 37:10.504
and we should be packin'
it full of strippers

37:10.504 --> 37:13.472
and we should all be
gettin', you know,

37:13.472 --> 37:14.922
on our way down
to Atlantic City.

37:14.922 --> 37:16.303
- Yeah, our wives
would love that.

37:16.303 --> 37:17.545
Look, he wants to play softball,
we're playin' softball.

37:17.545 --> 37:19.444
- Oh, my God, softball,
that's a lot of fun.

37:19.444 --> 37:20.893
- You all right?

37:20.893 --> 37:22.067
He said,

37:22.067 --> 37:24.069
he says you were
judgmental yesterday.

37:24.069 --> 37:25.450
- Who did, he did?

37:26.313 --> 37:28.556
Paulie said I was
being judgmental?

37:28.556 --> 37:30.248
- [Dez] Yeah.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.146
- He said that to you?

37:32.146 --> 37:33.251
When?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.769
- The other day.

37:34.769 --> 37:36.323
- He said I was being
judgmental the other day?

37:36.323 --> 37:37.565
To you?
- [Dez] Yeah.

37:37.565 --> 37:39.498
- He didn't say shit to
me, look, I was just,

37:39.498 --> 37:40.775
what, the other day, we talked.

37:40.775 --> 37:42.018
I was just telling him
what my feelings were,

37:42.018 --> 37:43.157
you know what I mean?

37:43.157 --> 37:44.296
I mean, he's my brother.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.539
I can't give him advice?

37:45.539 --> 37:47.437
- Don't give him advice
unless he asks for it.

37:47.437 --> 37:48.990
- No, that's what an older
brother's supposed to do.

37:48.990 --> 37:50.992
You know Paulie, he's
not gonna ask for advice.

37:50.992 --> 37:53.098
- Just do everyone
a favor, all right.

37:53.098 --> 37:54.272
Just for the next couple days,

37:54.272 --> 37:56.584
keep your opinions
about Sue to yourself.

37:58.379 --> 38:00.726
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's that mean?

38:00.726 --> 38:03.039
Did he say I said
somethin' about Sue?

38:04.109 --> 38:06.456
Jesus Christ, look, I'm just
lookin' out for him, man.

38:06.456 --> 38:08.216
I mean, seriously, do you
think he's doing this thing

38:08.216 --> 38:09.770
because he loves this girl?

38:09.770 --> 38:12.911
Or do you think he's doing
it because he knocked her up?

38:12.911 --> 38:15.223
- No, I think he's doing it
for all the right reasons.

38:15.223 --> 38:16.673
He loves her.

38:17.709 --> 38:19.297
- I still don't
understand why you would

38:19.297 --> 38:21.471
let his asinine
comments bother you.

38:21.471 --> 38:23.266
- [Paulie] Sue, how
could they not bother me?

38:23.266 --> 38:24.371
- Well, because they
would only bother you

38:24.371 --> 38:25.717
if they were true.

38:25.717 --> 38:28.340
- Look, he's my brother
and my best man.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.687
He's supposed to be
supportive, all right.

38:30.687 --> 38:32.827
Just think about what his
speech is gonna be like.

38:32.827 --> 38:35.485
To Paulie and Sue, I think
you're makin' a huge mistake.

38:35.485 --> 38:37.901
But good luck,
you're gonna need it.

38:37.901 --> 38:39.455
- What do you think, Paulie?

38:39.455 --> 38:41.353
You think we're
making a mistake?

38:41.353 --> 38:42.561
- [Paulie] What, what
are you talking about?

38:42.561 --> 38:43.700
No.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.288
- Well, are you
excited to get married?

38:45.288 --> 38:47.463
- Sue, of course I'm
excited to get married.

38:47.463 --> 38:49.396
I mean, look, all I'm saying

38:49.396 --> 38:51.570
is maybe Jimbo shouldn't
be the best man,

38:51.570 --> 38:53.814
if he feels the way he does.

38:53.814 --> 38:55.643
I mean, think about it, it
just doesn't feel right.

38:55.643 --> 38:57.680
- How do you feel, Paulie?

38:57.680 --> 38:59.026
- I mean, would you
still have proposed to me

38:59.026 --> 39:00.061
if I weren't pregnant?

39:00.061 --> 39:02.616
Of course, but, look.

39:02.616 --> 39:05.032
It's an unfair question,
because you are pregnant.

39:05.032 --> 39:06.413
And, you know,

39:06.413 --> 39:10.348
I'm not going to put
myself into a hypothetical.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.488
- If you're doing this out
of some kind of obligation,

39:12.488 --> 39:14.352
Paulie, then you
can forget about it.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.078
I want to get married to you.

39:17.078 --> 39:18.563
'Cause I love you.

39:18.563 --> 39:20.496
But if you don't feel
the same way about me,

39:20.496 --> 39:22.118
then you can just
forget about it.

39:22.118 --> 39:23.361
Forget about it.
- [Paulie] Sue, Sue.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.259
Of course I feel the same way.

39:25.259 --> 39:27.365
You know, you're
being irrational.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.229
Yes, I love you, but can
I say that positively,

39:30.229 --> 39:34.199
you know, I'm ready to
get married and have kids?

39:34.199 --> 39:35.959
I don't know.
[Sue gasps]

39:35.959 --> 39:37.547
- Excuse me?

39:37.547 --> 39:40.550
Then what are we
doing here, Paulie?

39:40.550 --> 39:41.793
What?

39:41.793 --> 39:43.967
- Look, look, this
is real life, okay.

39:43.967 --> 39:46.418
You know, these are the
cards we were dealt.

39:46.418 --> 39:47.937
- The cards we were dealt?

39:47.937 --> 39:49.525
This is not a God
damn hand of poker

39:49.525 --> 39:51.975
that's poppin' out
of my belly, Paulie.

39:53.494 --> 39:56.773
- Sue, this is crazy, we're
getting married in three days.

39:56.773 --> 39:58.085
I just told you
what my brother said

39:58.085 --> 40:00.570
'cause it pissed me off.

40:00.570 --> 40:01.537
[door slams]

40:02.607 --> 40:05.679
[sighs] Jesus.

40:05.679 --> 40:08.026
- [Dez] You know,
l was thinkin'.

40:08.026 --> 40:10.200
You should get into
upper management.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.409
- I was in upper management.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.686
- No, no, I'm not
talkin' about work,

40:12.686 --> 40:14.273
I'm talkin' about your
family, your new wife.

40:14.273 --> 40:15.585
You guys should start a family.

40:15.585 --> 40:17.311
It'd settle you down, man.

40:17.311 --> 40:19.762
Get rid of all that
noise in your head.

40:19.762 --> 40:21.591
- Where's this comin' from?

40:22.799 --> 40:24.352
- It's just,

40:24.352 --> 40:26.320
you know, you have a kid,
you walk in the light.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.080
You, I don't know,

40:28.080 --> 40:30.117
it gives you a reason to
wake up in the morning.

40:30.117 --> 40:31.049
[phone rings]

40:31.049 --> 40:32.153
Walk in the light?

40:32.153 --> 40:33.879
- Yeah.
[phone rings]

40:34.846 --> 40:36.226
What, it's too much?
[phones rings]

40:37.331 --> 40:38.505
- [Jimbo] Hold on.
- [Dez] Too heavy?

40:38.505 --> 40:39.471
- Yo.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.990
- [Voiceover] What the fuck?

40:40.990 --> 40:41.956
- What?

40:41.956 --> 40:43.993
- [Voiceover] Where are you?

40:43.993 --> 40:46.236
- What, I'm gettin'
lunch with Dez, why?

40:46.236 --> 40:47.893
- You asked me if you could
work a couple days this week.

40:47.893 --> 40:49.757
Don't you remember askin'
me if you could work today?

40:49.757 --> 40:50.862
- [Jimbo] Did we say today?

40:50.862 --> 40:52.450
- Yeah, we said today.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.348
- [Jimbo] I fuckin' forgot, I
was gettin' tuxedo's with Dez.

40:54.348 --> 40:56.384
- Yeah, I got mine
this morning, nice.

40:56.384 --> 40:58.594
Cummerbund, forget
about it, it's all over.

40:58.594 --> 41:00.941
- [Jimbo] Damn, I got busy,
man, we can't do this tomorrow?

41:00.941 --> 41:02.080
- No, we can't do it tomorrow.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.530
Tomorrow's Paulie's
softball game.

41:03.530 --> 41:04.910
You know, Jimbo, you're really
kind of screwin' me here.

41:04.910 --> 41:06.153
I'm short a man,
I got a job to do.

41:06.153 --> 41:08.051
- Fuck, come on,
Mike, God damn it.

41:08.051 --> 41:10.329
I'm goin' through some shit in
my life, real shit right now.

41:10.329 --> 41:11.434
And you're givin' me a hard time

41:11.434 --> 41:13.471
about edging some fuckin' lawn?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.576
I'll talk to you later.

41:17.544 --> 41:19.753
[vocalizes exasperation]

41:19.753 --> 41:21.340
[group chatter]

41:21.340 --> 41:22.583
- [Mike] You're wrong.

41:22.583 --> 41:23.550
Wally Schirra never
walked on the moon.

41:23.550 --> 41:25.103
[laughter]

41:25.103 --> 41:28.002
- So, my little guy's jumping
up and down on the bed, right.

41:28.002 --> 41:31.385
And he says to me, he says,
"Hey, pull my finger," right.

41:31.385 --> 41:34.492
So I pull his finger,
but instead of farting,

41:34.492 --> 41:37.495
the little guy, he's in
shorts, and he shits himself.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.703
[laughter]

41:38.703 --> 41:40.498
He's jumping up and
down on his bed.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.947
- [Jimbo] Poor kid.
- [Dez] And the little guy

41:41.947 --> 41:43.639
- [Jimbo] He followed through.
- [Dez] shits himself

41:43.639 --> 41:44.916
right then and there.

41:44.916 --> 41:46.469
- [Mike] What did you do?

41:46.469 --> 41:48.885
- I said, "Son, you're an
idiot, clean your shit up."

41:48.885 --> 41:50.853
- [TC] Oh, that's really
understanding of you, man.

41:50.853 --> 41:52.544
[group chatter]

41:52.544 --> 41:54.166
- No, no, listen,
you gotta learn.

41:54.166 --> 41:57.066
If you shit yourself,
you gotta pick it up.

41:57.066 --> 41:59.068
- I don't like that story
at all, it's kind of sad.

41:59.068 --> 42:00.276
- You know what, cousin Mike,
you gotta tell the story

42:00.276 --> 42:01.726
about the time you
pissed in your pants.

42:01.726 --> 42:02.934
- Which time was that?

42:02.934 --> 42:04.349
- Which time was
that, what was it?

42:04.349 --> 42:05.557
In Sisters Dorothy's
class, you were,

42:05.557 --> 42:06.800
I think, in 11th grade.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.043
- Sister Dorothy's
class was 4th grade.

42:09.043 --> 42:10.528
But you know what,
let Jimbo tell it.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.184
'Cause he was in the class,
he sat right behind me.

42:12.184 --> 42:13.531
- [Jimbo] No, it was 6th grade.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.877
- 6th grade, what difference,
I pissed my pants.

42:14.877 --> 42:16.395
Who cares what grade it was?

42:16.395 --> 42:17.845
- [Voiceover] Jimbo.

42:17.845 --> 42:19.744
- Yeah, okay, so we're
in Sister Dorothy's class

42:19.744 --> 42:22.332
and Mikey's sittin' two seats
up in front of me, right.

42:22.332 --> 42:23.851
[soft laughter]

42:23.851 --> 42:25.163
He says, he raises his hand,
"Can I go to the bathroom?"

42:25.163 --> 42:26.682
And she says, "No."

42:26.682 --> 42:30.202
All right, so 10 minutes pass
and he raises his hand again,

42:30.202 --> 42:31.479
and he says, "Can I
go to the bathroom?"

42:31.479 --> 42:32.550
And she says, "No," again.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.758
- And she knows I'm suffering,

42:33.758 --> 42:35.242
'cause she can see
the pain in my eyes.

42:35.242 --> 42:37.831
And you know what, she doesn't
care, because she's a nun.

42:37.831 --> 42:40.109
And she likes to
see kids suffer.

42:40.109 --> 42:41.628
- Yeah, and this was a big day.

42:41.628 --> 42:43.388
We had, like, these special
reports due, this book report.

42:43.388 --> 42:44.354
And he had just,

42:44.354 --> 42:46.149
you had done this thing on,

42:46.149 --> 42:48.255
you had drawn this
picture of Tom Seaver.

42:48.255 --> 42:49.946
Remember, you spent
days doing it?

42:49.946 --> 42:52.052
This really
passionate, intense--

42:52.052 --> 42:52.949
- [Mike] It was awesome.

42:52.949 --> 42:54.226
It had to be passionate.

42:54.226 --> 42:55.676
'Cause it was about
the '69 Mets, right.

42:55.676 --> 42:57.195
Tom Seaver, your favorite.

42:57.195 --> 42:58.748
So I drew the picture of
Tom Terrific on the mound.

42:58.748 --> 43:01.648
Wham with that fast ball,
inside out cuttin' action.

43:01.648 --> 43:02.856
Go ahead.

43:02.856 --> 43:04.582
- So, some other kid's
readin' this report.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.859
And I hear whimperin'.

43:05.859 --> 43:08.620
And I look up, and it's
Mikey and he's shakin'.

43:08.620 --> 43:10.001
Okay, and I'm wonderin'
what the hell's is goin' on.

43:10.001 --> 43:11.934
And I look down and I
notice there's a big,

43:11.934 --> 43:14.730
there's a pool of
piss in his seat.

43:14.730 --> 43:18.078
And it's drippin' down,
right on top of Tom Seaver.

43:18.078 --> 43:20.390
Right on top of his
report, this poor kid.

43:20.390 --> 43:23.255
And then the other kids are
noticing, and he starts to cry.

43:23.255 --> 43:24.705
Okay.

43:24.705 --> 43:27.432
And then Sister Dorothy notices,
and you know what she says?

43:27.432 --> 43:30.469
- She says, "Stop
being such a baby."

43:30.469 --> 43:31.643
- That's fucked up.

43:31.643 --> 43:33.818
- Yeah, but what does
my big brother do?

43:33.818 --> 43:35.613
I mean, the protector
of all of us.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.718
- Jimbo, check this out,
comes over to my desk,

43:37.718 --> 43:39.893
grabs me by my hand, and he
says, "Come on, we're leavin'."

43:39.893 --> 43:41.964
And he just walks me
through the class.

43:41.964 --> 43:43.586
And he walks me
right up to the door.

43:43.586 --> 43:44.829
And Sister Dorothy goes,

43:44.829 --> 43:47.072
"Where do you two
think you're going?"

43:47.072 --> 43:49.143
- How the fuck have l
never heard this story?

43:49.143 --> 43:50.455
- You've heard
this story before.

43:50.455 --> 43:52.043
- I have never heard
this story, before.

43:52.043 --> 43:53.527
- You know, you were
probably too busy worrying

43:53.527 --> 43:54.666
about how to get
the band together

43:54.666 --> 43:56.392
or something like that [mutters]

43:56.392 --> 43:58.187
[laughter]
- You guys don't wanna rock?

43:58.187 --> 43:59.395
- I do wanna rock.

43:59.395 --> 44:00.914
I just don't want
you to keep asking me

44:00.914 --> 44:02.847
what fuckin' dot we're on,
you know what I'm sayin'?

44:02.847 --> 44:04.676
[laughter]
[group chatter]

44:04.676 --> 44:05.953
- You're a bunch of dicks.

44:05.953 --> 44:07.472
I don't know why I
call you friends.

44:07.472 --> 44:08.404
- [TC] Come on, guys, let
Jimbo finish the story.

44:08.404 --> 44:09.647
- [Paulie] Finish the story.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.165
- And I said, "Get
out of our way."

44:11.165 --> 44:12.304
- No, that's not what he said,

44:12.304 --> 44:13.754
That's not what he said.

44:13.754 --> 44:15.756
Jimbo looks at Sister
Dorothy and says, I quote,

44:15.756 --> 44:17.655
"Get the fuck out of our way."

44:17.655 --> 44:19.242
- All right, but
here's the best part.

44:19.242 --> 44:20.209
- What's better than that?

44:20.209 --> 44:21.348
- So, here's the best part.

44:21.348 --> 44:22.590
[group chatter]
She does.

44:22.590 --> 44:24.006
She clears outta the way.

44:24.006 --> 44:26.456
They walk right outta the front
door of the school and go.

44:27.354 --> 44:29.667
That's the kind of
big brother I got.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.047
To big Jim, huh.

44:31.047 --> 44:32.635
My best man.

44:32.635 --> 44:33.705
- I'll toast to that.

44:33.705 --> 44:35.465
- [All] Jimbo.

44:35.465 --> 44:37.157
- Jimbo, that was
beautiful, man.

44:37.157 --> 44:38.814
- [Paulie] To
Jimbo, come on, bro.

44:38.814 --> 44:40.850
- [Mike] What about me, I'm
the one that pissed my pants.

44:40.850 --> 44:42.472
- Hey, Paulie, would
you be pissed at me

44:42.472 --> 44:43.922
if I didn't come
to your wedding?

44:43.922 --> 44:46.166
'Cause I'm startin' to
feel kinda weird about it.

44:46.166 --> 44:47.650
- Look, I know you're drunk,

44:47.650 --> 44:49.169
so I'm not going to pay
too much attention to this,

44:49.169 --> 44:50.860
but what the hell are
you feelin' weird about?

44:50.860 --> 44:52.241
- I don't even
have a girlfriend.

44:52.241 --> 44:53.552
I don't have a girlfriend,

44:53.552 --> 44:54.761
I live in the same
house I grew up in,

44:54.761 --> 44:56.694
l got the same job I
had since High School.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.212
That'd be great if
I was 23 years old,

44:58.212 --> 44:59.558
but I'm not 23 years old.

44:59.558 --> 45:01.837
I'm 33 years old.

45:01.837 --> 45:03.597
When am I gonna have a
family, he's got a family.

45:03.597 --> 45:06.117
He's got two beautiful boys,
you're starting a family.

45:06.117 --> 45:08.533
When's my family, what,
when I'm an old man?

45:08.533 --> 45:10.397
- What's that gotta do with
you not going to his wedding?

45:10.397 --> 45:11.639
- A lot.

45:11.639 --> 45:13.055
I don't want everyone
asking me about Jen

45:13.055 --> 45:14.953
and be answering questions
about Jen all night.

45:14.953 --> 45:17.024
- Who's gonna be asking?

45:17.024 --> 45:18.301
Who?

45:18.301 --> 45:20.062
- Listen to me, Michael,
you're my cousin, right?

45:20.062 --> 45:21.822
You're coming to my wedding.

45:21.822 --> 45:23.030
- All right, Paulie, okay.

45:23.030 --> 45:24.135
- [Paulie] Go to bed.

45:24.135 --> 45:25.619
- All right, all right.

45:26.654 --> 45:27.966
- [Paulie] Get some sleep.

45:27.966 --> 45:29.347
- [Dez] Get out.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.039
- I'm gonna call her.

45:32.039 --> 45:33.282
- [Paulie] No, no, you're not
gonna call anybody, all right?

45:33.282 --> 45:34.559
You're gonna go to bed.

45:34.559 --> 45:35.698
We got softball first
thing in the morning.

45:35.698 --> 45:36.941
- You're right, you're right.

45:36.941 --> 45:38.494
- [Jimbo] Hey, see you tomorrow.

45:38.494 --> 45:40.910
- Hey, why don't you wake
up the whole neighborhood?

45:42.187 --> 45:44.465
[makes obnoxious
vocalization] Smarten up.

45:44.465 --> 45:47.814
- Enough already, my
kids are sleeping.

45:47.814 --> 45:49.229
- I'm sorry, Dez.

45:53.060 --> 45:56.236
Hey, Pop, let's go fish.

45:56.236 --> 45:59.273
- [Dez] Isn't gettin'
married so much fun?

45:59.273 --> 46:01.137
- [Paulie] Oh yeah,
yeah, a lot of fun.

46:01.137 --> 46:02.414
A lot of fun.

46:02.414 --> 46:07.350
- Paulie, every time
a guy gets married,

46:07.592 --> 46:09.214
he gets divorced
from his friends.

46:09.214 --> 46:10.802
And his buddies are
never going to be

46:10.802 --> 46:12.873
100% supportive of that.

46:12.873 --> 46:14.737
- This has been a weird
week, you know, I mean,

46:14.737 --> 46:18.776
like Jimbo all of a
sudden seemed like
his old-self tonight.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.467
Right?
- [Dez] Yeah.

46:20.467 --> 46:23.332
- I'm thinkin' I should just
keep him as the best man.

46:23.332 --> 46:25.127
But then I got cousin Mike

46:25.127 --> 46:26.680
telling me he doesn't wanna
go to the fuckin' wedding.

46:26.680 --> 46:28.095
I mean, what the
hell is that about?

46:28.095 --> 46:29.338
- It's training you for kids.

46:29.338 --> 46:31.374
It's God's way of
training you for kids.

46:31.374 --> 46:32.651
I mean, every day you wake up,

46:32.651 --> 46:34.377
they can completely have
a different personality.

46:34.377 --> 46:35.585
Trust me.

46:35.585 --> 46:36.794
- [sighs] Man, I
gotta tell you, Dez,

46:36.794 --> 46:39.348
I'm freakin' out about that man.

46:39.348 --> 46:43.283
I mean, how do you
the whole kids thing?

46:44.249 --> 46:45.837
- I mean, honestly?

46:45.837 --> 46:48.253
If you have one kid,

46:48.253 --> 46:50.635
right, you loose a
little bit of your life,

46:50.635 --> 46:54.259
a little free time, a
Iittle bit of your freedom.

46:56.227 --> 46:59.955
You have two kids, your
life is over, Jojo.

46:59.955 --> 47:02.543
- So why do it, I mean...

47:03.510 --> 47:06.064
Why did you and Tina
have another kid?

47:06.064 --> 47:07.997
- What do you do
with your free time?

47:07.997 --> 47:09.619
Honestly, what do you do?

47:09.619 --> 47:11.000
You watch TV.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.933
You go and hang out with
these knuckle heads.

47:12.933 --> 47:14.486
You jerk off, right.

47:14.486 --> 47:18.697
Listen to me, free time, it's
not all it's cracked up to be.

47:19.802 --> 47:23.219
But at the end of the
night, if I couldn't,

47:23.219 --> 47:24.358
you know...

47:25.843 --> 47:27.810
If I couldn't go upstairs

47:28.846 --> 47:30.123
and check in on my little boys,

47:30.123 --> 47:31.572
you know, if I
couldn't look at 'em

47:31.572 --> 47:33.436
and make sure they're okay,

47:34.541 --> 47:36.681
you know, my life,

47:36.681 --> 47:39.408
[vocalizes disapproval]

47:39.408 --> 47:43.688
my life would be empty,
is what it would be.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.243
Look, there are
people that know,

47:47.243 --> 47:48.762
and there are people
that don't know.

47:48.762 --> 47:53.491
And you, my man, are about
to be a man that knows.

47:53.871 --> 47:55.320
[Paulie mutters]

47:55.320 --> 47:56.321
All right?

47:56.321 --> 47:58.806
- All right, thank you.

47:58.806 --> 48:00.532
- [Dez] No fear.

48:00.532 --> 48:01.740
- [Paulie] You sleep tight.

48:01.740 --> 48:03.501
- Hey, psst, Paulie.

48:05.123 --> 48:08.747
You know, I'm doin' this
whole band thing for you.

48:08.747 --> 48:11.164
So, you know, if you
don't wanna do it,

48:11.164 --> 48:12.544
just let me know, all right?

48:12.544 --> 48:15.754
- Dez, I'm into it, all right.

48:15.754 --> 48:17.549
- Nice.

48:17.549 --> 48:19.827
That's good, hey, if you
could just get the other guys

48:19.827 --> 48:22.106
a little excited about
it, that would great.

48:22.106 --> 48:23.555
Because it's important.

48:23.555 --> 48:25.730
I mean, it's really
important that we do this.

48:25.730 --> 48:27.007
All right?

48:27.007 --> 48:28.664
Hey, hey, Paulie.

48:29.527 --> 48:32.530
And just remember,
when we rock out,

48:32.530 --> 48:35.567
shirts are optional, baby.

48:35.567 --> 48:37.224
- Go to bed, Desmond.

48:37.224 --> 49:11.017
[Dez shushes]

49:15.366 --> 49:16.436
[guitar string twangs]

49:19.680 --> 49:20.750
[guitar string twangs]

49:22.373 --> 49:34.419
[meandering guitar playing]

49:38.768 --> 49:47.985
[soft guitar strumming]

49:52.334 --> 50:31.925
[bright guitar playing]

50:35.308 --> 50:37.137
- [Mike] These guys
have uniforms, we're
gonna get crushed.

50:37.137 --> 50:38.863
- All right, let's
go, bring it in here.

50:38.863 --> 50:40.934
Come on now, take a knee.

50:40.934 --> 50:43.488
[soft group chatter]

50:43.488 --> 50:45.766
- Get your hat off,
Jimbo, let's go, hats off.

50:45.766 --> 50:47.320
- I'm good, I'm good.

50:48.321 --> 50:51.565
- [All] Our father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

50:51.565 --> 50:53.843
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

50:53.843 --> 50:55.707
on Earth as it is in heaven.

50:55.707 --> 50:57.813
Give us this day,
our daily bread.

50:57.813 --> 50:59.642
Forgive us for our trespasses,

50:59.642 --> 51:02.162
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

51:02.162 --> 51:06.063
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.271
Amen.

51:07.271 --> 51:08.824
- All right, bring it
in here real quick,

51:08.824 --> 51:10.550
we do buttered tongue on three.

51:10.550 --> 51:11.585
One, two, three.

51:11.585 --> 51:13.346
Buttered tongue.
[groups cheers]

51:13.346 --> 51:15.037
- It's goin' right out there.

51:15.037 --> 51:16.866
[scattered cheering]

51:19.041 --> 51:23.494
[excited crowd chatter]

51:24.943 --> 51:27.187
- All right, Jimbo,
get ready to move.

51:28.154 --> 51:29.914
- Come on, Paulie,
do your thing.

51:29.914 --> 51:31.881
- Come on, Paulie.

51:31.881 --> 51:32.813
Paulie.

51:32.813 --> 51:33.987
Paulie, let's go, Paulie.

51:33.987 --> 51:38.578
[crowd cheers]

51:38.578 --> 51:39.648
Coney lsland, huh?

51:39.648 --> 51:41.581
What do you say to that, hotdog?

51:41.581 --> 51:43.410
- Come on, big mouth.

51:43.410 --> 51:44.722
Come on, big mouth.

51:49.244 --> 51:50.969

52:19.343 --> 52:20.861
You're out, I got it.

52:20.861 --> 52:22.656
What the fuck is
your fuckin' problem?

52:22.656 --> 52:24.106
- What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

52:24.106 --> 52:25.211
It was my ball, you
shouldn't have even tried

52:25.211 --> 52:26.143
to fuckin' get it.

52:26.143 --> 52:27.316
- They why didn't you get it?

52:27.316 --> 52:28.869
- Because you fuckin'
called for it.

52:28.869 --> 52:30.216
I didn't wanna get
barreled over by you,

52:30.216 --> 52:31.700
- Fuck you.

52:31.700 --> 52:33.288
Listen, next time I call
for it, clear the fuck out.

52:33.288 --> 52:34.565
I'm the center fielder.

52:34.565 --> 52:36.394
- Hey, you know what,
Jimbo, fuck you, man.

52:36.394 --> 52:37.809

I'm fuckin' done, all right.

53:02.731 --> 53:03.663
I'm goin' home.

53:03.663 --> 53:04.974
- Good, you big pussy, go home.

53:04.974 --> 53:06.183
Boohoo.

53:06.183 --> 53:07.667
- Hey, and you know,

53:07.667 --> 53:08.944
how about this, you're

53:08.944 --> 53:10.532
How about that,

53:10.532 --> 53:12.085
- [Jimbo] Bullshit,

53:12.085 --> 53:13.500
- Yeah, because of this.

53:13.500 --> 53:15.606
- It's a fuckin' softball
game, I'm your fuckin' brother.

53:15.606 --> 53:16.848
- Yeah, well, then why don't you

53:16.848 --> 53:19.023

01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:07.059
- [laughs] What are you giving
Jimbo a hard time about?

01:03:07.059 --> 01:03:08.992
- I'm actually not, I'm just
trying to make sure he's okay.

01:03:08.992 --> 01:03:10.131
That's all
- [Jimbo] Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:10.131 --> 01:03:11.373
[Mr. B chuckles]

01:03:11.373 --> 01:03:14.307
- I can tell you,
he is not okay.

01:03:14.307 --> 01:03:15.550
Look at him.

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:16.793
It's the middle
of the afternoon,

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.242
he's a married man and
he's in a titty bar.

01:03:18.242 --> 01:03:20.175
If that's doin' okay,
this world's upside down.

01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:21.763
- [Jimbo] Don't you start
in on me, all right.

01:03:21.763 --> 01:03:24.283
- Wanna hear what I tell this
bum every time I see him?

01:03:24.283 --> 01:03:25.594
He's lucky.

01:03:25.594 --> 01:03:27.148
He's lucky, he don't
know real hardship.

01:03:27.148 --> 01:03:28.839
He's like all the kids your age.

01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:31.669
Big fuckin' babies,
cryin' all the time.

01:03:31.669 --> 01:03:35.087
Cryin' all the time instead
of knowin' you's are lucky.

01:03:35.087 --> 01:03:36.088
Let me ask you a question.

01:03:36.088 --> 01:03:36.951
TC?
- [TC] Yeah.

01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:38.331
- Are you married?

01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:39.816
- [Jimbo] Oh, Jesus Christ.
- [TC] No, I'm not.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.058
- [Jimbo] You know, I've
heard this speech before.

01:03:41.058 --> 01:03:41.852
Excuse me, I'm going
to be at the bar.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.129
No, no, no, sit down.

01:03:43.129 --> 01:03:44.372
- [TC] That's all
right, I'm going--

01:03:44.372 --> 01:03:45.166
- [Mr. B] Where
are you gonna go?

01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:46.167
Stay here two seconds.

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:47.444
Learn something for a change.

01:03:47.444 --> 01:03:49.170
[TC clears his throat]

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:51.172
Are you married?

01:03:51.172 --> 01:03:52.311
- No, sir, no, I'm not.

01:03:52.311 --> 01:03:53.968
- [Mr. B] Any kids?
- [TC] No.

01:03:53.968 --> 01:03:56.142
- You ever been in the service?

01:03:56.142 --> 01:03:57.074
- Nope.

01:03:57.074 --> 01:03:58.558
- See, now, that figures,

01:03:58.558 --> 01:04:00.526
Because if you had
gone into the service,

01:04:00.526 --> 01:04:02.252
they would teach
you how to be a man.

01:04:02.252 --> 01:04:03.494
- Oh, really?

01:04:03.494 --> 01:04:04.979
- Instead, you stay
home with your mother,

01:04:04.979 --> 01:04:06.704
Iivin' in the same house you
were born in for 25 years.

01:04:06.704 --> 01:04:07.982
And what happens?

01:04:07.982 --> 01:04:10.777
She teaches you how
to be a cheerleader.

Definition of an adult is
a person that has a job,

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:18.164
is married, has kids
and owns a home.

01:04:19.131 --> 01:04:20.408
Okay?

01:04:20.408 --> 01:04:22.168
When I was growin' up,

01:04:22.168 --> 01:04:25.551
the average age of an
adult, by that definition,

01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:27.518
was 24 years old.

01:04:27.518 --> 01:04:28.968
Now, how old are you?

01:04:28.968 --> 01:04:30.556
- I'm 35, sir.

01:04:32.592 --> 01:04:34.974
- Christ had already
died on the cross

01:04:34.974 --> 01:04:37.874
for your sins by that age.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.979
Why don't you have
a wife and kids?

[Frozen Heart by

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:45.951
- 'Cause I'm gay,
sir, that's why.

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:50.196
Hey, Jimbo, come on,
what are you doin'?

01:04:50.196 --> 01:04:51.715
I think we should get
out of here, come on.

01:04:51.715 --> 01:04:55.029
- I'm just having a drink
with my friend Crystal.

01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:56.375
- I think we should
go, come on, let's go.

01:04:56.375 --> 01:04:57.894
- Dude, if you wanna go, go.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.275
I just got here, man.

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:01.932
- Come on, I wanna
talk to you over here.

01:05:01.932 --> 01:05:04.797
- If you wanna fuckin'
go, TC, just fuckin' go.

01:05:04.797 --> 01:05:06.316
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, is
everything all right here?

01:05:06.316 --> 01:05:07.662
- Yeah.

01:05:07.662 --> 01:05:08.594
- [TC] It's fine.
- [Bouncer] Everything's okay?

01:05:08.594 --> 01:05:10.596
- Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

01:05:12.287 --> 01:05:13.840
- Excuse me, ma'am,
can I talk to him

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.014
for a minute, please?
- [Jimbo] TC, stop.

01:05:15.014 --> 01:05:16.015
Fuck.
- [TC] Come on.

01:05:16.015 --> 01:05:17.430
Think of Julianna, come on.

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:19.398
- God damn it, don't you
fuckin' dare bring that shit up.

01:05:19.398 --> 01:05:21.434
- Exactly, think about it.

01:05:21.434 --> 01:05:22.919
This is not going to fix it.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.748
- TC, you are so fuckin'
close to gettin' slapped.

01:05:24.748 --> 01:05:26.750
Just get the fuck outta my face.

01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:29.546

ask you one last time.

01:05:29.546 --> 01:05:31.237
Please come with me right now.

01:05:34.654 --> 01:05:37.657
Okay, I tried man, I tried.

01:05:37.657 --> 01:05:41.420
- Shut the fuck up.

[soft thuds and rattling]
- Uh-oh, I hear thunder.

01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:52.224
Look at the old
man, he's an animal.

01:05:52.224 --> 01:05:53.777
Who's an animal?

01:05:53.777 --> 01:05:56.607
- Look if you want her, don't
be a wuss, go and get her.

01:05:56.607 --> 01:05:58.126
- I'm not a wuss, Pop, come on.

Just, she don't wanna
be bothered, that's all.

back together again, okay.

and get on with your life.

- It's over.

01:06:53.526 --> 01:06:54.769
- What happened, Jen, why?

01:06:54.769 --> 01:06:56.219
- [Voiceover] What did
you do to her, Michael.

01:06:56.219 --> 01:06:57.496
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
he didn't do anything.

01:06:57.496 --> 01:06:58.428
- No, what are you
doing here, Mike?

01:06:58.428 --> 01:06:59.912
Why are you upsetting my sister?

01:06:59.912 --> 01:07:01.362
- I'm not tryin' to upset
your sister, Top Cat.

01:07:01.362 --> 01:07:02.639
I'm just trying to get back
in my life, that's all.

01:07:02.639 --> 01:07:04.710
- She doesn't want to be
back together with you.

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.194
And she told you that already.

01:07:06.194 --> 01:07:09.197
Now, listen to me, I don't
wanna see you around here again.

01:07:09.197 --> 01:07:10.888
Or I'm gonna have to do
somethin' you won't like.

- [Mike] What are you
gonna do, Top Cat?

01:07:12.235 --> 01:07:13.512
You're 19 years old.
[Top cat groans in irritation]

01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:15.031
You're 19.

- [Top Cat] Don't be stupid.
- [Mike] He's 19 years old.

01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:18.034
- Listen to me, don't you be
stupid and make Top Cat angry.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.311
- Watch your hands.

01:07:19.311 --> 01:07:20.795
Angry, what about
my level of anger?

01:07:20.795 --> 01:07:22.728
Is anybody here concerned
about how angry I am?

01:07:22.728 --> 01:07:25.110
- All right, I'm gonna
give you 3 seconds.

01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:27.181
Get in your truck and go.

01:07:27.181 --> 01:07:28.251
One.

01:07:29.217 --> 01:07:30.356
Two.

01:07:30.356 --> 01:07:31.495
- Dick.

[loud thud]
[Mike yells in pain]

01:07:33.877 --> 01:07:35.672
Oh, you asshole, you hit me.

01:07:35.672 --> 01:07:37.260
- Yeah, I told you to
get out of here, man.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.400
- So you hit me when l
wasn't paying attention?

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.264
- Yes, and I'm going
to hit you again

01:07:41.264 --> 01:07:44.129
unless you get in
the truck and go.

01:07:44.129 --> 01:07:49.996
- You've changed, Top Cat.

01:07:54.173 --> 01:07:56.658
Hey, Jen, I got news for ya.

01:07:56.658 --> 01:08:00.110
You'll never find a guy like
me again as long as you live.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.594
I'm a good guy, Jen.

01:08:01.594 --> 01:08:03.493
And you blew it.

- How'd it go, son?

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.818
- Not so good, Pop.

01:08:18.818 --> 01:08:21.062
- All right, why don't
you go in the living room,

01:08:21.062 --> 01:08:23.375
lie down, put on the Met game.

01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:25.238
I'll make us a
meatloaf, how's that?

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.033
- That sounds really good, Pop.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:34.558
[soft guitar music]

01:08:34.558 --> 01:08:36.215
- Hey, babe.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.287
The crib is done.

01:08:39.287 --> 01:08:40.667
And it looks terrific.

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.152
- Good.

01:08:43.256 --> 01:08:46.225
Do you think you'll finish
painting her room tomorrow?

01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:47.709
- Can't the painting
wait a week?

01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:50.540
I mean, we're getting
married this weekend, babe.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.127
- I don't want it to wait.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.682
- But why does it
need to be tomorrow?

01:08:54.682 --> 01:08:57.823
- Because her room being done
makes things feel real to me.

01:08:57.823 --> 01:08:59.238
It's important.

01:08:59.238 --> 01:09:00.481
- So waiting until
after the weekend

01:09:00.481 --> 01:09:01.999
is going to make
it feel less real?

01:09:01.999 --> 01:09:03.484
- Yes.

01:09:03.863 --> 01:09:07.591
We said we'd have it done
by the wedding. [sighs]

01:09:10.076 --> 01:09:17.497
- I'm gonna get a beer.

01:09:21.984 --> 01:09:23.193
- [Jimbo] TC.

01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:24.608
- [TC] Jimbo, this
isn't good, man.

01:09:24.608 --> 01:09:26.300
- What's up, man, I
thought you left hours ago.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.197
- [TC] This isn't good.

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:28.404
- No, this is good.

01:09:28.404 --> 01:09:29.889
And it's none of your
fuckin' business.

01:09:29.889 --> 01:09:32.167
- [TC] Miss, look, I think
you should just go back, okay.

- [Jimbo] We're
going for a drink.

We're just going
for a fuckin' drink.

- [TC] Look, you don't want--

01:09:39.658 --> 01:09:41.142
- [Jimbo] Just shut
the fuck up, TC.

01:09:41.142 --> 01:09:42.626
- [Crystal] Listen, you
know what, Jimbo, I'll just

01:09:42.626 --> 01:09:43.938
- [Jimbo] Crystal, come on.
- [Crystal] Catch up with you

01:09:43.938 --> 01:09:45.319
some other time.
- [Jimbo] Don't listen to him.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:46.560
- [TC] Hey, Jimbo.
- [Jimbo] We're just goin'

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.942
for a fuckin' drink.
- [TC] Let her go.

01:09:47.942 --> 01:09:49.426
Let her get inside.
- [Jimbo] It's not a fuckin'--

01:09:49.426 --> 01:09:50.496
- [TC] Let her get inside,
just let her go inside.

01:09:50.496 --> 01:09:51.738
She's fine.
- [Jimbo] What the fuck.

01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:52.981
God damn it, what the
fuck are you doing, man.

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:54.189
- [TC] Just let her
go, okay, come on.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.743
- [Jimbo] What the
fuck are you doin'?

01:09:55.743 --> 01:09:56.985
- [TC] Think about this, all
right, just think about it.

01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:58.194
Think about your
wife and about it.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.367
You're gonna ruin your
whole fuckin' marriage.

01:09:59.367 --> 01:10:00.299
- My fuckin' marriage
is shit anyway.

01:10:01.058 --> 01:10:03.095
My marriage is fucked, man.

01:10:03.095 --> 01:10:04.683
You wanna know what's
fuckin' wrong with me?

01:10:04.683 --> 01:10:06.892
You wanna know what's fuckin'
wrong, is that what it is?

01:10:06.892 --> 01:10:08.100
Huh?

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:08.894
Is that what my
wife wants to know?

01:10:08.894 --> 01:10:10.654
Did she send you?

01:10:10.654 --> 01:10:12.104
- [TC] She didn't send me.

01:10:12.104 --> 01:10:13.278
- [mumbles] what my fuckin'
brother wants to know

01:10:13.278 --> 01:10:14.865
and his perfect
little fuckin' wife?

01:10:14.865 --> 01:10:16.626
What's wrong with
Jimbo, is that it?

01:10:16.626 --> 01:10:19.353
- [TC] Come on, Jimbo, just
relax, sit down here, all right,

01:10:19.353 --> 01:10:20.699
[mumbles] I'm gonna
get some coffee.

01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:22.425
- I don't want fuckin'
coffee, all right.

01:10:22.425 --> 01:10:23.874
- [TC] Look, it's
all gonna work out.

01:10:23.874 --> 01:10:25.876
- It's not gonna work
out, man it's fucked.

01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:27.223
And you know why?

01:10:28.431 --> 01:10:30.364
- [TC] Why?

01:10:30.364 --> 01:10:31.882
- You know why
Julianna hates me?

01:10:31.882 --> 01:10:33.298
- She doesn't hate you.

01:10:33.298 --> 01:10:35.231
- She fuckin', she
should, and you know why?

01:10:39.545 --> 01:10:41.444
I can't have kids, man.

01:10:43.825 --> 01:10:45.793
- What do you mean
you can't have kids?

01:10:48.658 --> 01:10:50.487
- She wants babies,
she wants babies.

01:10:50.487 --> 01:10:52.731
And for a year we were
fucking trying and then...

01:10:54.422 --> 01:10:56.666
[sighs] It wasn't
happenin', man.

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:58.357
So a couple of months
ago, I went to the doctor

01:10:58.357 --> 01:11:02.396
and he told me I had
some hypothalamic,

01:11:02.396 --> 01:11:04.777
pituitary, oh shit...

01:11:06.192 --> 01:11:07.987
so, spermyish, it's this thing,

01:11:07.987 --> 01:11:10.266
I'm totally and
completely infertile, man.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.267
- Man, I'm sorry.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:12.992
- No chance of having a kid.

01:11:12.992 --> 01:11:14.270
- [TC] I didn't know.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.478
- I can't have a kid,
you think she's going

01:11:15.478 --> 01:11:16.651
to fuckin' stay with me
if I can't have a kid.

01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:17.928
- [TC] She's gonna understand--

01:11:17.928 --> 01:11:19.275
- [Jimbo] [yells] to
fuckin' understand.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.760
Paulie's gonna have a kid, huh.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.968
Paulie's gonna have a kid.

01:11:22.968 --> 01:11:25.315
My little brother,
he's gonna have a kid.

01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:27.248
That's what a fuckin' man is.

01:11:27.248 --> 01:11:29.112
Someone who can have a kid.

01:11:31.942 --> 01:11:34.151
My little brother's gonna have
a fuckin' kid and I can't.

01:11:34.151 --> 01:11:37.120
I can't even be his
best man, what the fuck?

01:11:38.052 --> 01:11:47.372
He was my best man,
he was my best man.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:55.172
- Hey, Sue, I'm thinkin'
about going to Dez's

01:11:55.172 --> 01:11:57.830
for a couple of beers
tonight, if that's all right.

01:11:58.728 --> 01:12:01.075
- [Sue] It's almost midnight.

01:12:01.075 --> 01:12:04.043
- Actually, it's only 11:15.

01:12:04.043 --> 01:12:07.253
- Actually, that's
not the point, Paulie.

01:12:07.253 --> 01:12:09.394
The point is, is that I'm
pregnant and I'm gettin' scared,

01:12:09.394 --> 01:12:12.500
because you're so
off in your own shit.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.432
In your own feelings.

01:12:13.432 --> 01:12:15.054
And here I am, just sittin' here

01:12:15.054 --> 01:12:18.023
waitin' for you to
take care of me.

01:12:18.023 --> 01:12:21.992
- Sue, look, I mean, I think
you're kind of overreacting.

01:12:21.992 --> 01:12:23.615
I mean, I did take care
of the crib today, right?

01:12:23.615 --> 01:12:24.788
I mean, I finished the crib.

01:12:24.788 --> 01:12:26.100
- Overreacting?

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.241
It's been months since
you've given me flowers.

01:12:29.241 --> 01:12:31.692
How about a little
romance, Paulie?

01:12:31.692 --> 01:12:34.211
You know what would
be nice, occasionally?

01:12:34.211 --> 01:12:35.765
Breakfast in bed.

01:12:36.904 --> 01:12:41.460
Or better yet, how
about a foot massage?

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.602
Do you know what it's like
to be on your feet all day,

01:12:45.602 --> 01:12:47.190
five and a half months pregnant,

01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:48.916
planning a wedding
that your fiance

01:12:48.916 --> 01:12:50.849
has absolutely no interest in,

01:12:50.849 --> 01:12:52.713
and working your ass off?

01:12:52.713 --> 01:12:54.370
- Hey, you know what,
Sue, I mean, look.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:57.131
I don't see you makin'
me breakfast in bed.

01:12:57.131 --> 01:13:00.237
- You are not fucking
pregnant, Paulie.

01:13:00.237 --> 01:13:02.861
And I have to do everything.

01:13:02.861 --> 01:13:04.380
And when you actually
do contribute,

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.622
it's like pulling teeth.

01:13:05.622 --> 01:13:07.624
Like the God damn
crib for example.

01:13:07.624 --> 01:13:09.626
- Yeah, 'cause I'm not
under any pressure, right?

01:13:09.626 --> 01:13:11.697
I'm runnin' around all week
tryin' to keep everybody happy.

01:13:11.697 --> 01:13:12.629
But that's nothin'.

01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:13.699
- [Sue] What about my happiness?

01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:15.218
- Oh, please, Sue, I mean, look.

01:13:15.218 --> 01:13:18.394
I don't mean to sound
unsympathetic, all right.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.257
But why does it always
have to come back to you?

01:13:20.257 --> 01:13:21.293
You know, why?

01:13:21.293 --> 01:13:22.501
- Paulie, I'm so sorry.

01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:26.367
I mean, you have so
many outings to plan.

01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:28.749
The softball games,
and the fishing trips,

01:13:28.749 --> 01:13:30.336
and the golf outings.

01:13:30.336 --> 01:13:31.268
Your stupid fuckin' band.

01:13:31.268 --> 01:13:32.753
You know what, that's a lot.

01:13:32.753 --> 01:13:33.995
- [Paulie] You know what, fine.

01:13:33.995 --> 01:13:35.100
You know what, I'll
just stay home, okay?

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.379
- No, it's not about that.

01:13:39.863 --> 01:13:41.417
I miss my friend.

01:13:43.177 --> 01:13:45.869
I just want my friend back.

01:13:45.869 --> 01:13:48.872
And I don't even know
if you want this.

01:13:48.872 --> 01:13:50.115
If you want me.

01:13:50.115 --> 01:13:54.430
If you want this
baby or any of this.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.017
This whole life.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:10.515
[drum playing]

01:14:14.864 --> 01:14:16.210
[yells in frustration]

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:19.109
[phone rings]

01:14:19.109 --> 01:14:20.041
- What?

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:21.111
- [Voiceover] Hey, it's me, TC.

01:14:21.111 --> 01:14:22.319
Look, I need a favor.

01:14:22.319 --> 01:14:24.218
- Well, then you called
the wrong guy, TC.

01:14:24.218 --> 01:14:25.875
- Oh, come on, I don't
need this right now.

01:14:25.875 --> 01:14:27.324
I got Jimbo right
here passed out.

01:14:27.324 --> 01:14:29.430
He's in a bad way, and
he's been drinkin' all day.

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:31.467
I just don't want
to bring him home.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.951
- [Mike] Did you call Paulie?

01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:34.849
- Paulie doesn't need to deal
with this shit right now.

01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:35.885
- [Jimbo] Is that Paulie?

01:14:35.885 --> 01:14:37.369
Paulie.
- [TC] Come on, relax.

01:14:37.369 --> 01:14:40.165
- All right, bring him
over here, but listen, TC.

01:14:40.165 --> 01:14:42.063
Listen real close, okay?

01:14:42.063 --> 01:14:45.826
[pounding of drums]

01:14:45.826 --> 01:14:47.137
[laughs obnoxiously]

01:14:48.932 --> 01:14:50.831
- Such an ass, man.

01:14:50.831 --> 01:14:54.317
- Uno, dos, tres. [yells]

01:14:54.317 --> 01:15:01.289
[drum playing]

01:15:04.983 --> 01:15:07.123
- [Voiceover] Shut the
Hell up, that sounds awful.

01:15:07.123 --> 01:15:10.367
- [Mike] I know it sounds awful,
that's why I'm practicin'.

01:15:10.367 --> 01:15:13.370
[muffled voices]

01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:14.579
- [Pop] What the Hell is this?

01:15:14.579 --> 01:15:16.097
- It's Jimbo, dad,
he's all drunk.

01:15:16.097 --> 01:15:17.996
[chattering]

01:15:17.996 --> 01:15:19.860
- [Pop] You're still
a pack of idiots.

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:22.794
- [Mike] What did we do,
we're helpin' him out.

01:15:22.794 --> 01:15:24.347
- [TC] We gotta get
him some coffee.

01:15:24.347 --> 01:15:25.590
- [Mike] Dude, what is this,
Little House on the Prairie?

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:26.556
- [TC] Get him on the couch.

01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:27.799
- [Pop] How'd this happen?

01:15:27.799 --> 01:15:28.972
- [Mike] How'd this
happen, practice.

01:15:28.972 --> 01:15:30.249
How else does it
happen, he's a drunk.

01:15:30.249 --> 01:15:31.492
- [Pop] I'll talk
to him in morning.

01:15:31.492 --> 01:15:32.700
You son of a bitches.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.908
You wake me up the
middle of the night.

01:15:33.908 --> 01:15:35.116
- [Mike] You were up
anyway, watchin' porno.

01:15:35.116 --> 01:15:36.670
What are you arguin' about?

01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:37.878
Jimbo.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.432
Cover yourself up.

01:15:40.432 --> 01:15:41.537
[groaning]

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.814
Jimbo, look at this,

01:15:42.814 --> 01:15:44.919
hey, daddy.

01:15:46.093 --> 01:15:47.715
I was jokin'.

01:15:50.097 --> 01:15:51.339
[door slams]

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:52.962
- You've gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

01:15:52.962 --> 01:15:54.204
You said to her,

01:15:54.204 --> 01:15:55.689
"I don't see you making
me breakfast in bed."

01:15:55.689 --> 01:15:57.794
- Well, she was screamin'
her head off at me.

01:15:57.794 --> 01:15:59.278
You know, I mean,
like a crazy woman.

01:15:59.278 --> 01:16:01.418
- Yeah, she's pregnant, she's
allowed to scream at you.

01:16:01.418 --> 01:16:02.350
- All the time?

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.490
- Yeah, It's called hormones.

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:05.975
[Paulie sighs]

01:16:05.975 --> 01:16:08.046
- Look, I know I'm supposed
to be excited for the wedding,

01:16:08.046 --> 01:16:10.635
and for the most part I am.

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:13.154
The thing that scares
me are those moments

01:16:13.154 --> 01:16:17.227
when I'm not excited, like
tonight for example, you know?

01:16:18.228 --> 01:16:20.196
- Can I just say, I
think you're blowin' it.

01:16:20.196 --> 01:16:21.784
I mean, that's just her,
she's lookin' for something.

01:16:21.784 --> 01:16:23.061
She's askin' for help.

01:16:23.061 --> 01:16:24.856
And you're sittin'
here at this bar.

01:16:24.856 --> 01:16:26.271
What are you doing?

01:16:26.271 --> 01:16:27.479
- Yeah, you know
what it is, Dez?

01:16:27.479 --> 01:16:30.344
It's like, a wedding
is one thing.

01:16:30.344 --> 01:16:32.622
You know, there's all the
insanity that goes around that,

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:35.142
and preparing for that.

01:16:35.142 --> 01:16:37.731
And everyone gets nervous
before they get married.

01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:41.597
But, you know, we got a kid
comin' in a couple of months.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:45.601
A kid that we didn't plan for.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.430
And I guess I'm just, you know,

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:49.743
I don't know if I can
be a good dad, you know.

01:16:49.743 --> 01:16:52.228
I don't know if I can do it.

01:16:52.228 --> 01:16:53.988
- Let me paint you this
little scenario, okay?

01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:56.025
Sue gets done with
your indecision.

01:16:56.025 --> 01:16:57.060
All right, she can't
deal with it anymore.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.579
And you guys break up.

01:16:58.579 --> 01:17:00.857
And say, down the road, like
three years down the road,

01:17:00.857 --> 01:17:02.997
she meets this guy and
he's a great guy, right.

01:17:02.997 --> 01:17:04.516
And he's not a coward.

that's kinda weird, right?

- Mikey, what are
you getting at?

01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:43.511
- Okay, it's gotta be easier
to date if you're gay, right,

01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:46.031
because with girls it's like,
you gotta know what she likes,

01:18:46.031 --> 01:18:47.239

tough too, man.
