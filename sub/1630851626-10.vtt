WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.743
Previously onB Positive...How is she?

00:04.787 --> 00:06.832
She's gone.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.098
Hmm.

00:11.141 --> 00:13.056
So, this van girl?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.840
Hannah.Hannah.

00:14.884 --> 00:15.928
Yeah.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.105
What's the deal with Hannah?

00:18.148 --> 00:19.541
I told you.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.672
You know, we spent
the night together,

00:20.716 --> 00:22.326
and then she ripped me off.

00:22.370 --> 00:23.893
Wow, that's crazy.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.199
[chuckles forcefully]

00:25.242 --> 00:26.461
She cute?

00:26.504 --> 00:28.332
Why do you care?

00:29.377 --> 00:31.944
Well, why wouldn't I, you know?

00:31.988 --> 00:32.945
You're my friend.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.034
Interesting.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.078
What's interesting?

00:35.122 --> 00:36.340
Nothing's interesting.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.081
You don't like
the way I look?

00:38.125 --> 00:40.083
No. Yeah.

00:40.127 --> 00:43.086
Maybe it's too festive
for the Red Lobster.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.088
Great,
then you can go alone.

00:45.132 --> 00:48.439
As you lie alone in bed tonight,
consider this,

00:48.483 --> 00:51.225
I'm not wearing any panties.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.097
[yawns softly]

00:54.141 --> 00:55.751
Morning.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.231
What are you doing?

00:57.274 --> 00:59.537
Going on the road with you.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.409
Get out of my bed.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.197
Look at you.
You're doing real good.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.546
Yeah.

01:09.591 --> 01:10.983
We're just gonna go out
to the pickleball court

01:11.027 --> 01:13.073
and then loop back
around to your room.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.552
I don't think so.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.598
Wait, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

01:16.641 --> 01:21.298
I'm going to sit
on my titanium ass.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.475
Norma, the only way
your hip is gonna heal

01:24.519 --> 01:26.347
is if you do a lot of walking.

01:26.390 --> 01:27.913
I don't care if it heals.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.438
Let me just sit here
and die a slow death.

01:30.481 --> 01:31.526
Okay.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.096
Hey,
I am not gonna let you quit.

01:36.139 --> 01:37.358
We are gonna get through this.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.969
You always have such
a positive attitude.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.797
I'm doing my best.Yeah.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.799
Well, it's starting
to piss me off.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.280
Hey, what are you doing?

01:46.323 --> 01:47.803
Oh, just cutting
the umbilical cord,

01:47.846 --> 01:49.239
if you will.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.849
Thanks for letting me
mooch your juice.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.156
That's van life talk
for "electricity."Hmm.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.723
Where are you going?

01:54.766 --> 01:56.899
The Florida Keys.

01:56.942 --> 01:59.162
Oh, and FYI,
Harry's coming with me.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.250
What?

02:00.294 --> 02:01.425
Yeah, he says he needs a break.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.557
Too many memories here.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.341
Ugh. Poor guy.

02:04.385 --> 02:06.082
Well,
at least he has memories.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.693
Most of the jokers around here
can't remember yesterday.

02:08.737 --> 02:11.087
I think the road will be
a nice distraction.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.611
Plus, I wouldn't mind
getting to know the man.

02:13.655 --> 02:14.960
We have a lot in common.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.919
Name one thing.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.616
We're both men of few words.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.662
Laconic, one might say.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.143
Taciturn. Introspective.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.756
Hey, maybe Harry can be
your wingman.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.193
Help you pick you
another van chick.

02:30.237 --> 02:34.545
I'm referring to the deceitful
seductress Hannah.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.506
It's interesting you keep
bringing her up.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.421
It's not interesting.Oh, it's interesting.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.032
Hey, take care of Harry.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.816
I will.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.166
I'll text you
from the road.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.211
Pics, GIFs,
the occasional emoji.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.778
Just let me know
if it gets annoying.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.214
I can tell you now.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.433
Bye.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.782
Bye, Norma.

02:53.825 --> 02:54.870
Yeah.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.177
Be safe.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.006
So, what's the deal
with you two?

03:02.007 --> 03:03.095
There's no deal.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.836
[chuckles] Interesting.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.229
It's not interesting!

03:54.843 --> 03:56.061
Seeing the beautiful sights

03:56.105 --> 03:57.628
of this great land of ours.Yeah.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.369
That's a lovely Costco.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.068
All right, you need to
take I-90.
Uh, no.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.157
Actually, we're gonna take
the I-95 south

04:05.201 --> 04:06.768
to the Florida Keys.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.770
You know, I've always wanted
to see Hemingway's house

04:08.813 --> 04:10.424
and eat an authentic Cubano.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.208
BT dubs,
that's a ham sandwich...

04:12.252 --> 04:13.253
I know what it is.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.124
...with cheese and pickles.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.996
[chuckles] Then we'll
head up the Gulf Coast

04:18.040 --> 04:21.565
and make our way west
to the Grand Tetons.

04:21.609 --> 04:24.829
I need to make a small detour.Sure. Where?

04:24.873 --> 04:26.396
Wisconsin.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.138
Wisconsin? That's, like,
a thousand miles that way.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.096
I want to go that way.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.185
I want to spread
Meredith's ashes

04:33.229 --> 04:35.144
at the spot we got engaged,

04:35.187 --> 04:37.364
which is that way.

04:37.407 --> 04:41.237
Okay. Right. Sorry,
I-I didn't know.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.979
Do you think we could head
that way after we hit the Keys?

04:44.022 --> 04:46.198
No.[chuckles softly]

04:46.242 --> 04:49.332
Come on, we're not
on any schedule.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.378
You know,
we're footloose and fancy-free.

04:51.421 --> 04:55.207
I'm footloose, you're
fancy-free. [chuckles]

04:55.251 --> 04:58.167
"They're cops,
but they're also best friends."

04:59.386 --> 05:00.909
[chuckles]

05:00.952 --> 05:02.563
Okay, Wisconsin, here we come.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.652
That way.

05:06.088 --> 05:08.351
Oysh.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.266
What's the matter?Let's just say

05:10.310 --> 05:11.963
that everything I've eaten
for the last five days

05:12.007 --> 05:13.965
is still in me.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.750
That's the painkillers
you're on.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.360
So that's the choice I have?

05:17.404 --> 05:21.146
To be in agony
or to be backed up like Elvis?

05:21.190 --> 05:22.800
[phone vibrates]

05:22.844 --> 05:24.759
[gasps softly]
Oh, boy.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.413
What?[groans]

05:26.456 --> 05:29.111
It's my big sister. She's
in town and wants to see me.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.417
And that's bad?Yes,

05:30.460 --> 05:32.680
it is.
She's kind of a scam artist.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.595
She only shows up
when she wants my money,

05:34.638 --> 05:36.161
my drugs or my boyfriend.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.946
Oh, we have the same sister.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.600
[sighs]
Couple of years ago,

05:39.643 --> 05:41.210
I was dating a
rich drug dealer,

05:41.253 --> 05:43.560
so she hit the trifecta.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.910
Does she know
you're a wealthy woman now?

05:45.954 --> 05:48.957
You know, I may have forgotten
to mention that

05:49.000 --> 05:51.960
to every member of my family.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.658
So, how are you
gonna handle this one?

05:54.702 --> 05:56.443
I'll show you.
[clears throat]

05:56.486 --> 05:59.446
"New phone. Who dis?"

05:59.489 --> 06:01.491
Here's your laxative,
Norma.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.319
Oh, could you say it
a little louder?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.974
I don't think
everybody heard you.Sorry.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.237
It's very powerful.
Drink it in your room.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.673
Okay, I get it.I'm serious.

06:09.717 --> 06:10.761
In the bathroom.

06:12.241 --> 06:16.767
So, I'm thinking our
next book club selection

06:16.811 --> 06:19.727
will be Madame Bovary.
There's sex.

06:19.770 --> 06:20.728
There's suicide.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.120
And good news for you:

06:22.164 --> 06:24.079
it's very short.

06:24.122 --> 06:27.256
Sounds like you got to be
a madame with bovaries

06:27.299 --> 06:29.084
to enjoy it.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.912
Here's your turkey
bacon, Professor.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.479
Ah, thank you, Bert.

06:32.522 --> 06:33.871
It's not as good as pork,

06:33.915 --> 06:35.307
but at least
no animals were killed.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.876
Actually, it...Let it go.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.748
Hey, while I got you here,

06:40.791 --> 06:42.967
my dad's birthday's
coming up.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.012
Any suggestions?

06:44.055 --> 06:45.709
Why are you asking us?

06:45.753 --> 06:47.232
BERT:
Not to be disrespectful,

06:47.276 --> 06:50.148
but he's on the homestretch
like you guys.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.848
How about
one of them weighted blankets?

06:53.891 --> 06:55.763
Nah. My mom's on the heavy side,

06:55.806 --> 06:57.852
so he kind of already has one.

06:58.983 --> 07:00.332
What about a nice robe?

07:00.376 --> 07:02.204
He's got a robe.
What he needs is a belt

07:02.247 --> 07:04.032
so we don't see his nuts
at dinner.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.730
Well, bon appétit.

07:07.688 --> 07:11.082
Something really bad
happened to him as a kid.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.737
May I join you?Please.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.479
You look very pretty
this morning.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.959
Thank you.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.136
S-Since I got you here,

07:21.179 --> 07:22.485
uh...

07:22.529 --> 07:25.314
I was thinking
maybe you and I could...

07:25.357 --> 07:28.883
try going out
to dinner sometime?

07:28.926 --> 07:31.320
Again? To dinner?

07:32.277 --> 07:34.497
Is he seriously
asking me out again?

07:34.541 --> 07:35.977
It would appear so.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.500
How should I handle it?

07:37.544 --> 07:38.675
PETER:Depends.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.111
Are you a merciful woman?

07:40.155 --> 07:41.199
Not generally.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.549
You guys know I can hear you.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.941
BETTE:
Excuse me,

07:43.985 --> 07:46.291
I am talking to Peter.Give him a chance.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.815
His brains
are nowhere to be found,

07:47.858 --> 07:49.860
but his heart
is in the right place.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.908
Thank you. I would like
to go for dinner with you.

07:53.951 --> 07:57.215
Great.
I was thinking Papa John's.

07:57.259 --> 08:00.044
They put the cheese
right in the crust.

08:00.088 --> 08:03.004
It'll blow your freakin' mind.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.311
This is
where the mercy comes in.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.229
Okay, remember the
plan. I just work here.

08:11.273 --> 08:12.840
I am not the boss.
Right.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.494
I'm the boss.No, the boss is
someone else.

08:14.537 --> 08:15.973
Who?It doesn't matter.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.584
It matters to me.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.542
[gasps]Natalie!

08:19.586 --> 08:21.109
Gina!
[screams]

08:21.152 --> 08:23.241
[laughs]Oh, my God!

08:23.285 --> 08:25.330
Oh, you look great!

08:25.374 --> 08:26.593
You, too.[laughs]

08:26.636 --> 08:28.943
Welcome to Valley Hills.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.597
This is my coworker Gabby.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.034
[chuckles]:
Coworker? Please, I'm your boss.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.818
Nice to meet you.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.168
You, too.Mm. So, what brings you to town?

08:37.212 --> 08:38.953
I am singing at
a little club.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.563
You should come and see me.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.826
Uh, I'd love to.Uh-uh.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.654
You're working the night shift.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.656
Can't you cover for me, Gabby?

08:46.700 --> 08:49.050
[chuckles]: You want your boss
to cover for you?

08:49.093 --> 08:50.747
I do. I really do.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.532
Come on, I'll show you around.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.795
If you need me,
I'll be in my office

08:54.838 --> 08:56.710
smoking a bowl.

08:58.668 --> 09:01.366
Ah.
[chuckles]

09:01.410 --> 09:03.238
If you're thinking you
didn't hear a flush,

09:03.281 --> 09:04.848
you would be correct.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.068
You see, that's the number
one rule around here.

09:07.111 --> 09:10.462
Get it? Number
one? No flushing?

09:10.506 --> 09:13.640
[grunts][grunts mockingly, chuckles]
Pardon me.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.164
Oh, forgot my book.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.905
[both grunt]

09:17.948 --> 09:20.603
Guess I should've bought you
dinner first, huh? [chuckles]

09:20.647 --> 09:22.126
Uh, tomorrow...

09:22.170 --> 09:23.911
[grunts]there is

09:23.954 --> 09:26.957
an authentic frontier fort
just off the highway.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.916
We could stop,

09:28.959 --> 09:31.092
maybe take a photo
dressed up as fur trappers.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.225
Now, why would we
do that, hmm?

09:34.269 --> 09:37.054
Rhetorical question.
'Cause it's awesome.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.621
I don't think so.Come on.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.536
We got to have some
fun along the way.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.539
And this is educational fun,
the best kind.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.802
I need to get to Wisconsin.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.891
Fine.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.939
I need my phone.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.160
Oh, how about that?
I can feel yours.

09:56.204 --> 09:59.076
[phone vibrates]Ooh, someone's texting you.
[chuckles]

10:00.512 --> 10:01.949
And this is our day room,

10:01.992 --> 10:04.691
where our residents hang out
and socialize.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.649
Everyone seems so happy.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.782
What do you got
'em on, lithium?

10:08.825 --> 10:10.435
Just love.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.959
And edibles.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.003

10:13.047 --> 10:14.614
Hi, Jerry.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.660
Hi, um... Jennifer? Jenny.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.444
Gina.[chuckles]:
Oh, Gina.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.708
Right. Sorry, I'm new here,

10:21.751 --> 10:25.059
and I don't know the names
of all the orderlies.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.365
Disorderlies.
[laughing][laughing]

10:27.409 --> 10:28.628
Oh, Jenny.

10:32.806 --> 10:36.070
[Jerry exhales]Oh, hey, Norma.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.767
This is my sister Natalie.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.813
Nice to meet you.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.250
Gina,
I don't want to embarrass you,

10:42.293 --> 10:46.123
but you have to pay me back
that $300.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.734
I get paid
a week from Friday.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.736
You'll get your money.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.651
I better.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.134
All right,
can I show you the game room?

10:58.440 --> 10:59.484
[mouths]

11:02.226 --> 11:04.751
So, how long you gonna
keep up this act?

11:04.794 --> 11:06.840
Act? What do you mean?

11:06.883 --> 11:08.319
Where you pretend

11:08.363 --> 11:10.191
you didn't just inherit
millions of dollars.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.933
[chuckles]
Oh.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.456
Oh, can I explain?

11:14.499 --> 11:16.153
Go ahead.Uh...

11:16.197 --> 11:18.678
I was trying to trick you.

11:23.900 --> 11:27.512
All right, look,
it was a tough day.

11:27.556 --> 11:28.992
We bickered.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.299
Some feelings were hurt.
Mostly mine.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.517
But I know

11:32.561 --> 11:34.041
what'll make it all better.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.696
It's time to break out
the s'mores kit, baby.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.786
[chuckles]
Thank you, Williams Sonoma.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.831
Pass.What?

11:41.875 --> 11:43.441
How can you turn down s'mores?

11:43.485 --> 11:45.705
Because I'm not eight years old.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.359
Oh, come on.
Everybody loves s'mores.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.884
They're so good,
you always want s'more. Huh?

11:50.927 --> 11:54.148
No one ever says, "No, thanks,
I've had s'nough." [chuckles]

11:54.191 --> 11:56.933
I'm sorry.
Did I hurt your feelings again?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.152
Yeah.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.023
Look, I know
we're on a mission,

12:00.067 --> 12:02.460
but can't we have
a little fun along the way?

12:02.504 --> 12:04.027
Wh-What does that mean?
We're gonna stop

12:04.071 --> 12:06.203
at every lamebrain tourist trap?

12:06.247 --> 12:09.729
Not all of 'em.
Just some. Or one.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.426
[sighs]

12:11.469 --> 12:13.036
Why'd you even want
to come with me?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.603
I've asked myself
the same question.

12:14.646 --> 12:17.519
[sighs]
Okay. I get it.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.521
You're having a tough time.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.479
But I honestly thought

12:21.523 --> 12:23.394
this trip would help
take your mind off things.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.831
If all you wanted to do

12:24.874 --> 12:26.267
was get to Wisconsin
as fast as possible,

12:26.310 --> 12:27.616
you should've flown.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.663
I'm going to bed.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.275
And there's
nothing lamebrained

12:34.318 --> 12:36.364
about
the Orville Redenbacher Museum.

12:37.539 --> 12:40.585
Guy was basically
the Steve Jobs of popcorn.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.117
Hey.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.119
What do you want?

12:52.162 --> 12:54.077
I came to hear you sing.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.644
Really?Yeah.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.254
Did you pay
the five-dollar cover charge,

12:57.298 --> 13:00.388
or is that too much
for a minimum-wage orderly?

13:00.431 --> 13:01.781
Natalie, come on.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.740
I'm a hot girl.
I don't pay covers.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.394
Just so you know,
I didn't come to town

13:06.437 --> 13:08.700
to ask you for a handout.
I came because I have some news.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.180
That you couldn't tell me
over the phone?

13:10.224 --> 13:11.181
No.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.270
Okay, go ahead.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.321
I have to have surgery
on my vocal cords.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.366
Why?I have polyps.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.760
Oh, Nat.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.718
I'm so sorry.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.459
When is the surgery?

13:28.503 --> 13:30.679
As soon
as I can save up the money.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.378
And there it is.

13:34.422 --> 13:37.642
There's what?
I didn't ask you for a penny.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.166
You are telling me
that your singing career

13:39.209 --> 13:41.037
is dependent on my money.No.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.605
My singing career is dependent
on this very expensive surgery

13:43.648 --> 13:45.694
that my insurance won't cover.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.174
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:47.217 --> 13:48.610
I have to get back to work.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.439
You are so full of it.
There is no surgery.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.354
There are no polyps.
This is just another scam

13:53.397 --> 13:54.616
trying to get in my pocket.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.661
Do you hear yourself?

13:56.705 --> 13:58.925
Money has made you
an awful person.

last night,

14:43.099 --> 14:44.753
and now I'm getting
the silent treatment,

14:51.020 --> 14:52.848
Hang on.What?

14:52.892 --> 14:56.591
He, uh, he left me a note.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.202
"Drew, you were right.
This was a bad idea.

to the airport,

15:00.856 --> 15:04.381

He dumped me.

Did he rob you

15:10.257 --> 15:11.867
Very funny.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.956
You know, it's interesting
you keep bringing her up.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.001
It's not interesting.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.090
Oh, it's very interesting.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.137
And then when she sang,

15:21.181 --> 15:23.661
I started thinking that
she was telling the truth.

15:23.705 --> 15:24.967
[chuckles]

15:25.011 --> 15:26.664
So, what's the plan?

15:26.708 --> 15:30.059
[sighs] I guess I give her
the money for the operation.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.975
Well, that would be
the Christian thing to do.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.022
You think?I don't know.
It's what I've heard.

15:38.546 --> 15:41.201

is that money gonna be?

15:41.244 --> 15:43.507
Not at all.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.989
I just don't want to feel like
I'm being taken advantage of.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.470
Oh, sweetie,
that's what families are for.

15:50.732 --> 15:53.300

should cover the surgery.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.086
All right.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.740
I'm ready to go.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.832
I'm also ready for you to take
your hand off my shoulder.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.921
Right. Sorry.
[chuckles]

19:44.879 --> 19:47.621
You know, we're not far
from a Bavarian village

19:47.664 --> 19:49.623
with a giant
glockenspiel clock.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.538
Maybe we can go tomorrow.

19:51.581 --> 19:54.628
Don't toy with me.No, I-I'm-I'm serious.

19:54.671 --> 19:55.890
[Bavarian accent]:
Oh, Papa,

19:55.933 --> 19:57.413
that would be wunderbar.
