My name is Oliver Queen.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.609
To save my city.

I told a guy the truth
and he got struck by lightning.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.244
To be fair,
probably won't happen again, statistically.

03:07.600 --> 03:12.527
Telling Thea the truth won't make
her safer, just the opposite.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.650
What we're doing, Roy, it's dangerous.

Once he gets the boat working,
Slade will have no more need for him.

04:38.680 --> 04:43.527
So let's not kid ourselves. Doing this is
effectively sentencing Hendrick to death.

He would do the same thing to any of us
