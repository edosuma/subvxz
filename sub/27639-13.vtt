06:47.115 --> 06:49.993
Gives you toned arms,

06:47.115 --> 06:49.993
firm butt... kind eyes.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.786
If you're lying down,

06:50.035 --> 06:51.786
it ain't a workout.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.538
Just 'cause you can't do it...

06:53.580 --> 06:56.124
-Oh, I could do it.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.124
-I know he could do it.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.458
I don't think she could do it.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.459
Me neither.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.627
The yoga instructor's

06:58.501 --> 06:59.627
a friend of mine

06:59.669 --> 07:01.796
and he invited me,

06:59.669 --> 07:01.796
so I can totally do it.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.465
Ooh. Janet's in love.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.842
[Jung] Now I'm definitely going.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.094
-Janet's boyfriends

07:05.884 --> 07:07.094
are always hilarious.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.094
-[laughs]

07:07.135 --> 07:08.262
He's not my boyfriend.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.138
Hey, remember

07:08.303 --> 07:10.138
Shorty McWeird-Walk?

07:10.180 --> 07:11.598
Or that guy

07:10.180 --> 07:11.598
I pushed in the pool?

07:11.639 --> 07:13.267
-He couldn't swim!

07:11.639 --> 07:13.267
-Yeah, he could.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.602
You put that one guy in

07:13.308 --> 07:15.602
a headlock for a whole party.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.478
-He couldn't breathe.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.478
-Yeah, he could.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.439
-Argh!

07:17.520 --> 07:19.439
-Fine, I won't go.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.774
Wouldn't want

07:19.480 --> 07:20.774
to scare off your boyfriend.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.192
He's not my boyfriend.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.485
And he wouldn't be

07:22.234 --> 07:24.485
scared by you anyway.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.862
So, what's the problem?

07:25.904 --> 07:28.073
-There isn't one.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.073
-Good. Let's go.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.033
-Mmm-hmm.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.033
-Should I bring a pillow?

07:30.075 --> 07:31.451
Ha-ha.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.494
Should he? Should I?

07:33.536 --> 07:35.289
I don't know.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.289
I didn't even open the mat.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.507
[clears throat]

07:46.549 --> 07:48.009
Oh, Yobo.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.511
How was your day?

07:48.051 --> 07:50.511
Busy at the store? Hello.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.514
Hi. Yeah. Very busy.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.514
Cleaning, stocking,

07:53.556 --> 07:55.892
help people find

07:53.556 --> 07:55.892
what they looking for.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.685
You work so hard.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.147
Maybe I bring you

07:57.727 --> 08:00.147
cookie and tea in bed.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.690
Like in fancy hotel or hospital.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.945
Yeah. That sound nice.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.945
But first, relax time.

08:09.906 --> 08:10.949
[clears throat]

08:13.576 --> 08:14.535
Yobo...

08:14.577 --> 08:16.121
Something bother you?

08:16.163 --> 08:19.374
Yeah. When you watching TV,

08:19.416 --> 08:20.667
keep pants on.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.544
And take stinky

08:20.708 --> 08:23.544
feet off the table.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.465
Oh, my mistake. Bad husband.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.968
Oh, you take ring off?

08:30.010 --> 08:33.554
-Oh?

08:30.010 --> 08:33.554
-Hmm. Finger look

08:30.010 --> 08:33.554
so funny without ring.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.765
Oh, yeah. I just take off.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.558
Have to, for all kind of reason.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.686
Make sandwich,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.686
wash face, play piano.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.562
All women do like that.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.731
Oh. I always keep ring on.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.693
Most important symbol

08:43.773 --> 08:46.693
of love and commitment.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.613
Okay, yeah, if you need me

08:46.734 --> 08:50.613
I'm gonna be in bedroom,

08:50.655 --> 08:52.699
bathroom, and then Janet room.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.618
I just stay here

08:52.740 --> 08:55.618
and watch my sport highlight.

08:57.954 --> 09:01.041
Oh. Maybe before

08:57.954 --> 09:01.041
you put ring back on

09:01.082 --> 09:03.418
you can make me

09:01.082 --> 09:03.418
cookie from scratch?

09:11.426 --> 09:14.971
Hey, Janet,

09:11.426 --> 09:14.971
these guys are going so hard.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.139
Shh-shh.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.433
Hey, Nathan. Waddup?

09:18.475 --> 09:20.352
Janet, I'm glad you came.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.769
Yeah, wouldn't miss it.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.398
It's going to be amaze-zen.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.233
Amazing and zen together...

09:26.274 --> 09:27.608
-at last.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.608
-Ugh.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.152
"Hatha" lot of pressure.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.029
Better make sure

09:29.194 --> 09:31.029
I make "Na-mis-takes."

09:31.071 --> 09:32.613
Dear god, there's two of them.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.574
Don't worry.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.574
I'm sure you'll be great.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.616
As long as you don't suck!

09:36.951 --> 09:38.161
I was kidding.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.414
She's harmless.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.414
I'm Jung, by the way.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.790
Hey. Nathan. Welcome.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.252
-Jung's my brother.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.252
-Oh!

09:45.293 --> 09:50.257
Great. Great.

09:45.293 --> 09:50.257
Well, let's get started.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.633
[exhales] Welcome everyone.

09:52.675 --> 09:56.430
Let's begin in Child's Pose.

09:56.471 --> 10:00.183
A deep inhale and exhale...

10:00.225 --> 10:02.352
-Janet, so you gonna

10:00.225 --> 10:02.352
ask him out?

10:00.225 --> 10:02.352
-Shut up.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.645
Let's get into our

10:02.394 --> 10:04.645
first downward dog,

10:04.687 --> 10:05.939
pedaling the feet

10:05.980 --> 10:08.233
-Hey. Ask him out now.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.233
-[whispers] Shut up.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.111
Deep breath in and release.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.530
[farts]

10:15.198 --> 10:16.657
Whoa, Janet! I don't think

10:16.699 --> 10:18.076
that's what

10:16.699 --> 10:18.076
he meant by release.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.411
What?

10:19.453 --> 10:20.870
No, I didn't.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.873
It's okay, Janet.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.873
Letting go makes us free.

10:23.915 --> 10:27.794
Now, let's step to the top of

10:23.915 --> 10:27.794
our mats for sun salutations.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.798
See you.

10:33.716 --> 10:34.759
[door bell dings]

10:35.552 --> 10:36.677
[chuckles nervously]

10:36.719 --> 10:39.139
Okay, I'm going

10:36.719 --> 10:39.139
to keep going out now.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.681
Everything okay?

10:40.723 --> 10:43.435
Yeah, yeah. Everything okay.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.435
Very okay. You very okay?

10:43.477 --> 10:46.354
Yobo, I think this

10:43.477 --> 10:46.354
has gone on long enough.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.274
-What you talking?

10:46.396 --> 10:49.274
-It's so normal

10:46.396 --> 10:49.274
to make a mistake.

10:49.316 --> 10:53.361
Like, ah, one time

10:49.316 --> 10:53.361
I lose $300 playing poker.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.696
That is so much!

10:53.403 --> 10:55.696
Why you doing like that?

10:55.738 --> 10:58.699
And I break you

10:55.738 --> 10:58.699
high heel shoe

10:55.738 --> 10:58.699
killing centipede.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.327
I loved those shoes.

11:00.368 --> 11:04.705
I know. But, if you can

11:00.368 --> 11:04.705
forgive me for all that,

11:04.747 --> 11:07.292
then I can forgive you for...

11:08.751 --> 11:09.710
this one thing.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.546
Which is...

11:11.879 --> 11:13.256
something.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.510
-What something?

11:13.298 --> 11:16.510
-You know. Just, uh, something.

11:16.551 --> 11:20.514
But, uh, you is busy leaving

11:16.551 --> 11:20.514
and I is busy working,

11:16.551 --> 11:20.514
so we finish talk later.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.516
Yeah. Okay.

11:22.557 --> 11:26.019
Yeah. Remember,

11:22.557 --> 11:26.019
make mistake

11:22.557 --> 11:26.019
is so normal, okay?

11:26.060 --> 11:27.562
-See you.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.562
-Okay, bye.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.945
[Shannon] Terence?

11:34.777 --> 11:35.945
What the eff?

11:35.987 --> 11:38.615
What? I looked it up online.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.615
It's worth 500.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.741
We were being nice

11:38.657 --> 11:40.741
by not charging you

11:38.657 --> 11:40.741
the full amount.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.827
Which we knew.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.827
But didn't charge you.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.745
Because we're nice,

11:42.869 --> 11:44.745
not ignorant.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.080
Guys, I'm taking all the risk.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.748
My name and number's

11:46.122 --> 11:47.748
on that flyer.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.708
If I go missing, that's on me.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.751
[Shannon]

11:49.750 --> 11:50.751
What's it gonna take, Terence?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.753
You think I won't play hardball,

11:50.793 --> 11:52.753
'cause I will.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.964
Don't make me

11:52.795 --> 11:54.964
call your flute coach.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.383
If this is an official offer,

11:56.424 --> 11:57.800
I really prefer

11:56.424 --> 11:57.800
you use the number.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.722
That's a pretty good price.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.142
Get out of my office, Omar!

12:06.184 --> 12:07.561
I thought we had a meeting.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.604
Oh. Right.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.572
[Jung] So I felt open.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.572
I felt like I could

12:15.610 --> 12:18.572
concentrate better.

12:18.613 --> 12:19.906
[Nathan] Mindfulness.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.908
And you're totally right.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.370
Last night after class,

12:21.949 --> 12:25.370
I just kept my phone off

12:21.949 --> 12:25.370
and I didn't miss anything.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.787
Gotta live in the moment.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
Today's a gift, that's why

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
they call it the present.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.749
Whoa.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.711
I'm gonna write

12:30.791 --> 12:32.711
that on my phone.

12:32.751 --> 12:33.878
Hey.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.589
-Hey.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.589
-[Nathan] Janet.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.006
Good to see you.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.634
Well, gotta work on these

12:37.048 --> 12:39.634
spaghetti arms. [chuckles]

12:39.676 --> 12:41.428
Uh, we don't body shame here.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.304
Okay, everyone. Before we begin,

12:43.346 --> 12:46.099
let's just take

12:43.346 --> 12:46.099
a few minutes to breathe

12:46.140 --> 12:49.143
and release

12:46.140 --> 12:49.143
the stress of our day.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.813
To be here,

12:49.185 --> 12:52.813
in the present moment.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.816
[sighs]

12:55.858 --> 12:57.736
-So, you gonna ask him out?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.736
-No.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.279
'Cause a fart ventriloquist

12:59.320 --> 13:00.821
came along

12:59.320 --> 13:00.821
and ruined everything.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.323
You have got to stop blaming me.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.824
Nathan was all flirty,

13:03.866 --> 13:06.453
but now he's Johnny bromance,

13:03.866 --> 13:06.453
"No body shaming here, Janet."

13:06.494 --> 13:07.954
He's actually really into you.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.706
-Right.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.706
-Yeah. It surprised me, too.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.666
I came in early

13:09.748 --> 13:11.666
to talk about my core

13:11.708 --> 13:13.710
and he was all

13:11.708 --> 13:13.710
"Janet this" and "Janet that."

13:13.752 --> 13:15.878
I mean,

13:13.752 --> 13:15.878
barely even talked

13:13.752 --> 13:15.878
about my obliques.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.255
I mean, we still did,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.255
which was great.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.839
Are you serious?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.425
Ah, yeah.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.425
They're a little uneven,

13:18.881 --> 13:20.425
but there's poses for that.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.009
-No, Nathan!

13:20.467 --> 13:22.009
-Oh, yeah. He's a great guy.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.844
Works out, watches what he eats.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.556
Bit into himself, but hey,

13:23.886 --> 13:26.556
if you got it, flaunt it.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.848
No, don't do this.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.226
What? He's cool, fit,

13:27.890 --> 13:30.226
solid head of hair.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.061
I mean,

13:30.268 --> 13:32.061
if anything, he's like me

13:30.268 --> 13:32.061
and I'm way out of your league.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.522
Okay. I do not want

13:32.103 --> 13:34.522
to date my brother!

13:36.899 --> 13:39.193
Which is what I heard

13:36.899 --> 13:39.193
someone say once.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.488
Okay. Um...

13:41.529 --> 13:43.114
maybe we can

13:41.529 --> 13:43.114
talk about it more later?

13:43.156 --> 13:45.575
Yeah, I'd like that.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.827
Talking to you, later,

13:45.617 --> 13:48.827
not dating my brother.

13:48.869 --> 13:52.248
Okay, everyone,

13:48.869 --> 13:52.248
today we're going to start...

13:52.290 --> 13:53.500
You are such a nerd.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.751
...as we come to lay on our...

13:54.793 --> 13:56.043
[Pastor Nina] Are you sure

13:54.793 --> 13:56.043
you left it here?

13:56.085 --> 13:59.880
Yeah, yeah. I remember

13:56.085 --> 13:59.880
I take off to prepare food.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.717
Pastor Nina!

13:59.922 --> 14:02.717
Ready for our coffee date?

14:02.759 --> 14:05.804
-You dating Jimmy Young?

14:02.759 --> 14:05.804
-He means our therapy sessions.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.890
Mrs. Kim, what's wrong?

14:07.054 --> 14:09.890
You lose your ring again?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.100
What?

14:12.477 --> 14:13.894
What do you know about ring?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.397
Oh, I find by kitchen sink

14:13.936 --> 14:16.397
last time and give to Mr. Kim.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.899
Did he say anything

14:16.439 --> 14:18.899
about a finder fee?

14:19.651 --> 14:20.901
Jimmy, shall we?

14:20.943 --> 14:23.070
I brought you these.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.615
Well, I know

14:23.112 --> 14:25.615
what we're talking

14:23.112 --> 14:25.615
about this session.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.117
[chuckles softly]

14:29.035 --> 14:30.620
[Kimchee] Bad news, Terence.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.912
Shannon and I submitted

14:31.954 --> 14:33.914
our coffee receipts

14:31.954 --> 14:33.914
to the petty cash.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.043
So, technically the prizes,

14:33.956 --> 14:37.043
including the barbecue,

14:33.956 --> 14:37.043
belong to Handy.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.545
Boom.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.088
And, as such, weren't ours

14:38.586 --> 14:41.088
to sell in the first place.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.215
Double boom.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.008
So, you're saying

14:42.256 --> 14:44.008
as Back Manager

14:44.050 --> 14:46.386
I can invoice

14:44.050 --> 14:46.386
all of my past snacks

14:46.427 --> 14:48.471
for which

14:46.427 --> 14:48.471
I have kept the receipts,

14:48.513 --> 14:50.473
a.k.a all of them.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.808
Dammit, Terence.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.934
Stop eating like that!

14:53.976 --> 14:55.895
Hey, guys! We should

14:53.976 --> 14:55.895
totally get this barbecue.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.732
Set it up outside and,

14:55.936 --> 14:58.732
you know, have barbecues.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.942
It's still available.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.738
-Yeah! But it's 400 bucks.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.738
-Terence won't budge.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.155
It's too bad.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.155
A staff barbecue

15:06.197 --> 15:08.366
would have been

15:06.197 --> 15:08.366
great for morale.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.826
But I made an investment.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.118
We could throw in a hundred.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.079
-I'm in.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.079
-Hell, yeah.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.831
But it costs $400.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.165
[Jung] We got three so far.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.958
You throw in a hundred,

15:16.207 --> 15:17.958
we're all equal partners, T-Dog.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.547
I'm in!

15:22.589 --> 15:24.924
-This is gonna be fun.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.924
-[Kimchee] Yeah, it is!

15:26.426 --> 15:27.927
Do we get our hands up?

15:29.011 --> 15:30.555
Well I'm doing it.

15:33.015 --> 15:33.974
Yobo!

15:34.016 --> 15:35.309
Oh!

15:35.351 --> 15:37.687
Uh, just, uh, tidy up, huh?

15:35.351 --> 15:37.687
[chuckles nervously]

15:37.729 --> 15:39.397
I know you like

15:37.729 --> 15:39.397
clean house, Yobo.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.816
You had ring all this time

15:39.439 --> 15:41.816
and you make me think I lose?

15:41.858 --> 15:43.025
You did lose!

15:43.067 --> 15:45.027
Yeah. Then you find and keep.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.027
Give to me my ring.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.113
I don't have.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.989
Jimmy Young tell me

15:47.154 --> 15:48.989
he give to you.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.199
He did.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.785
And it's here.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.202
Somewhere.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.579
You lose my wedding ring?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.749
Yeah. But, uh,

15:57.791 --> 16:00.000
I couldn't lose ring

15:57.791 --> 16:00.000
if I don't have ring

16:00.042 --> 16:03.212
and only reason I have ring

16:00.042 --> 16:03.212
is because you lost first.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.924
So whose is fault? You fault.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.008
So... even-steven.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.552
Not even-steven.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.639
Maybe we both lose ring,

16:09.594 --> 16:12.639
but you is worse

16:12.680 --> 16:14.849
because you lie about ring.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.352
And Umoneem give

16:14.891 --> 16:18.352
to me that beautiful ring

16:14.891 --> 16:18.352
and now it's gone.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.604
[exhales]

16:27.361 --> 16:30.030
Maybe my umma

16:27.361 --> 16:30.030
come back down from heaven

16:30.072 --> 16:32.074
and take ring back

16:30.072 --> 16:32.074
because she miss so much?

16:32.116 --> 16:34.452
[chuckles softly] Yeah. Maybe.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.665
Maybe she wants you

16:36.245 --> 16:38.665
to buy me new ring?

16:38.706 --> 16:39.707
[chuckles softly]

16:40.166 --> 16:42.042
Maybe.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.587
With gold flower in middle

16:42.084 --> 16:44.587
of diamond circle.

16:44.629 --> 16:45.755
But maybe not.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.548
But maybe.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.269
Stop eating all the chips.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.269
We're going out.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.772
Or we could stay in,

17:00.311 --> 17:02.772
cancel the reservation.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.065
Do you know how hard

17:02.814 --> 17:05.065
this place is to get into?

17:05.107 --> 17:07.067
Hmm. You must really like me.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.277
[chuckles]

17:08.319 --> 17:09.988
I like the restaurant.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.125
[knock on door]

17:25.461 --> 17:28.088
Raj! Or Doctor Mehta, sir?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.632
Hey, Gerald. Is Janet here?

17:29.674 --> 17:31.091
I don't know. Um...

17:31.133 --> 17:34.094
Janet? Ra... Raj is here!

17:34.136 --> 17:35.722
-[Janet] Oh, my God!

17:34.136 --> 17:35.722
-[thump]

17:37.348 --> 17:40.685
So, would you like

17:37.348 --> 17:40.685
some pineapple juice?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.102
Raj. What are you doing here?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
I did it, Janet. I did it.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.105
I broke up with Divya!

17:46.106 --> 17:47.316
Right. For how long?

17:47.358 --> 17:49.109
I know it took a while

17:47.358 --> 17:49.109
and it's messy

17:49.151 --> 17:50.236
and everyone's

17:49.151 --> 17:50.236
going to freak out,

17:50.277 --> 17:52.112
but I don't care

17:50.277 --> 17:52.112
because I want to be with you.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.614
[Nathan] Hi.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.950
Hey.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.117
Oh.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.411
This is Nathan.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.079
This is Raj.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.833
Gerald.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.669
So, should I go?

18:03.875 --> 18:06.669
I feel like you guys

18:03.875 --> 18:06.669
need some space.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.880
-Thank you.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.880
-No.

18:08.922 --> 18:13.133
We are going to dinner.

18:08.922 --> 18:13.133
Because we made a reservation

18:08.922 --> 18:13.133
and so they are expecting us.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.095
And you can't just show up

18:13.175 --> 18:16.095
whenever you want.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.347
To the restaurant.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.347
Where we are going.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.266
-Let... let's go.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.266
-Okay.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.397
And you can't just

18:24.144 --> 18:26.397
spring this on someone.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.942
I have my own life.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.942
I wasn't just waiting

18:26.439 --> 18:28.942
around for you.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.401
That's what this is about.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.696
I mean, I understand

18:32.236 --> 18:33.696
what you did

18:33.738 --> 18:35.698
was probably hard,

18:33.738 --> 18:35.698
if you did it.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.784
-I did.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.784
-And I'll bet Divya was...

18:37.825 --> 18:39.660
How was Divya?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.660
No, actually no.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.746
Now is not the time

18:39.702 --> 18:41.746
because I am going--

18:41.788 --> 18:43.122
Because you have a date.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.165
Exactly.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.132
Just forgot my purse.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.930
[door closes]

18:58.972 --> 19:01.140
So, how much does it cost

18:58.972 --> 19:01.140
to cancel a wedding?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.143
-So beautiful.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.143
-Mmm.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.062
No dent, no scratch.

19:06.104 --> 19:09.440
Still, not same

19:06.104 --> 19:09.440
as Umoneem's ring,

19:06.104 --> 19:09.440
but very beautiful.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.110
And a good deal.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.946
-Thanks to your bargaining.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.946
-And you crying.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.072
[both chuckle]

19:18.324 --> 19:20.118
I never going to take off.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.536
Even when I wash dish.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.955
[both chuckle]

19:25.915 --> 19:28.334
-Oh, look like it's--

19:25.915 --> 19:28.334
-Laundry day.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.004
-Can I get some--

19:28.375 --> 19:31.004
-Change? Yeah,

19:28.375 --> 19:31.004
toonies or loonies or--

19:31.045 --> 19:32.338
Quarters, please.

19:32.379 --> 19:35.174
Hmm. Fun game we play, uh?

19:32.379 --> 19:35.174
Finish each other...

19:37.259 --> 19:39.595
Yeah, okay.

19:39.637 --> 19:43.099
Oh! Also, I found this

19:39.637 --> 19:43.099
behind a box of crackers.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.309
Oh! Thank you.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.561
My wife always

19:45.351 --> 19:47.561
losing this, huh?

19:47.603 --> 19:49.063
Well, it's found now.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.190
-Yobo!

19:49.105 --> 19:51.190
-Yeah.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.442
[chuckles softly]

19:53.484 --> 19:55.862
Nothing. Just, uh, say hello.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.072
Hi.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.575
I give to her later.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.618
[clicks tongue]

20:07.414 --> 20:09.208
Still just waiting

20:07.414 --> 20:09.208
for my change.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.543
Oh, yeah.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.585
-Quarters.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.585
-Yeah.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.258
But I gave you

20:15.131 --> 20:18.258
and Shannon a hundred each.

20:18.300 --> 20:22.763
Then you doubled the price

20:18.300 --> 20:22.763
and we both threw

20:18.300 --> 20:22.763
the hundred back in, so...

20:22.805 --> 20:25.058
Right. But, wait, wasn't

20:22.805 --> 20:25.058
that my money I gave you?

20:25.099 --> 20:27.185
Face it, Terence.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.185
Math isn't your strong suit.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.855
So, do we need

20:28.268 --> 20:30.855
to be here or...

20:30.897 --> 20:33.107
-What do you mean?

20:30.897 --> 20:33.107
-She means are you paying us?

20:33.149 --> 20:34.274
Not technically--

20:34.316 --> 20:35.776
Bye.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.070
See you Monday.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.281
[Jung] What is going on there?

20:41.323 --> 20:42.282
The Shannon Special.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
How is just ketchup special?

20:44.326 --> 20:46.286
Ah! Don't yuck my yum.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.081
You have terrible burger game.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.290
It's... it's relish

20:48.122 --> 20:50.290
and onions all the way.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.043
Sometimes banana peppers,

20:50.332 --> 20:52.043
sometimes.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.627
-That's a swamp burger.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.627
-Fine.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.089
Maybe one day
