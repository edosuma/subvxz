He was too much

Well, <i>I'll</i> do it, then.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.070
Why is it any different?

39:09.105 --> 39:11.573
This is not who I am.
It's not who <i>you</i> are.

39:17.713 --> 39:18.913
Well, give it to me,

39:18.948 --> 39:21.416
And -- and I'll take it
to the crime lab.

39:21.450 --> 39:23.418
Maybe they can
track something.

39:31.527 --> 39:33.595
[ sighs ]

39:37.233 --> 39:38.700
[ siren wails ]

39:38.734 --> 39:41.336
[ police radio chatter ]

39:52.181 --> 39:55.817
Korsak:
It's tommy o'rourke.

39:55.851 --> 39:59.421
Some would say it's
a fitting end for a killer.

40:16.672 --> 40:18.239
That's me.

40:18.274 --> 40:19.374
As a baby.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.410
With doyle.

40:22.445 --> 40:24.379
Who tipped him off?

40:24.413 --> 40:26.648
Not me.
You said not to.

40:29.752 --> 40:31.853
I think the message
is pretty clear, though.

40:31.887 --> 40:34.589
"don't mess
with my family."

40:34.623 --> 40:36.825
You do what you need
to do to protect family.

40:44.767 --> 40:46.768
[ grunts ]

40:46.802 --> 40:47.836
[ exhales sharply ]

40:47.870 --> 40:49.237
Well...

40:49.271 --> 40:50.872
That's it, I guess.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.274
[ sighs ]

40:53.309 --> 40:57.045
Now I will turn on
the main water valve.

40:58.547 --> 41:00.115
[ rattling ]

41:00.149 --> 41:01.282
Jane:
You got this, pop.

41:01.317 --> 41:02.884
I hope so, sweetie.

41:06.922 --> 41:09.591
Well, here goes nothing.

41:15.331 --> 41:18.032
[ squeak, light whooshing ]

41:20.269 --> 41:21.402
Oh!                          Oh!

41:21.437 --> 41:22.403
Yeah!

41:22.438 --> 41:23.438
[ applause ]

41:23.472 --> 41:25.473
Very nice!

41:25.508 --> 41:26.808
Very nice, pop.
Very nice.

41:26.842 --> 41:28.276
And you --
you're a genius.

41:28.310 --> 41:30.311
[ laughs ]
yes. I am.

41:30.346 --> 41:32.213
And a humble one, too.

41:32.248 --> 41:33.281
[ both laugh ]

41:33.315 --> 41:34.649
What?

41:34.683 --> 41:37.218
It only takes 150 I.Q. Points
to be a genius.

41:37.253 --> 41:38.453
What, so you're
a <i>dumb</i> genius?

41:39.421 --> 41:40.421
Ah-cha!

41:40.456 --> 41:41.389
Ah.
[ squawks ]

41:41.423 --> 41:42.590
Hey!

41:42.625 --> 41:44.092
Come here.
We just got it fixed.

41:44.126 --> 41:45.860
Are you still sorry you didn't
grow up with a sibling?

41:45.895 --> 41:47.028
That's enough.
That's enough. All right?

41:47.062 --> 41:49.164
Yeah, I am.
[ laughs ]

41:49.198 --> 41:51.866
Here, well,
we'll cure you of that.

41:52.835 --> 41:54.435
Okay.
Yeah, aim at the head.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.770
Face, preferably.
Oh!

41:55.805 --> 41:56.738
Yes. Nice.
Very nice.

41:56.772 --> 41:57.739
Wait a minute.
Okay.

41:57.773 --> 41:59.407
[ laughs ]
I got him.

41:59.441 --> 42:01.576
Get him.
Get him right in the face!
