WEBVTT

00:26.041 --> 00:27.000
Thank you.

00:27.541 --> 00:29.375
Why does booze always make me smile?

00:58.375 --> 00:59.208
GANGNEUNG

01:11.250 --> 01:12.958
Look at this.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.000
He's over there.

01:35.958 --> 01:37.333
KIM HEE-AE

01:37.416 --> 01:38.416
Hello.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.166
-It's chilly today.
-Yes.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.791
-This way.
-It's just right.

01:41.875 --> 01:44.875
-It snowed a lot.
-Yeah.

01:44.958 --> 01:46.625
Shall we greet like this?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.875
PEERS OF THE SAME AGE

01:49.958 --> 01:52.208
-Take a seat.
-It's nice.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.375
Wow, great.

01:54.458 --> 01:57.083
Many people come to drink during daytime.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.041
I guess this isn't heavy drinking.

01:59.125 --> 02:00.375
-Take a seat.
-Yes.

02:00.458 --> 02:01.708
Was the drive here rough?

02:01.791 --> 02:03.333
No, it was rather quick.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.541
-We haven't met since the wedding.
-Right.

02:07.708 --> 02:09.916
Do you come to Gangneung
every now and then?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
When I was shooting
The World of the Married.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.041
The drama.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.666
-We shot at Gangneung Station.
-Oh, I see.

02:16.750 --> 02:21.708
In that scene, a guy that bothers me
dies from an accident.

02:21.791 --> 02:24.291
The shooting lasted all night
at Gangneung Station.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.916
Actually, Gangneung

02:29.458 --> 02:32.000
has the most breweries per capita.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.125
GANGWON-DO

02:33.208 --> 02:36.791
Gangneung has
the most breweries per capita.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.958
-Brewery?
-A brewery.

02:39.541 --> 02:42.208
It's where you make beer.

02:42.708 --> 02:43.833
It's English. Cool, right?

02:43.916 --> 02:46.666
Breweries have machines like that.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.708
I see.

02:47.791 --> 02:50.541
Have you been to one?

02:50.625 --> 02:53.750
When I traveled to Great Britain.

02:54.416 --> 02:57.375
What's that famous beer called? Ireland.

02:58.416 --> 03:00.416
-I get confused. Dark beer.
-Ireland?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.541
-Famous for their dark beer.
-I forget.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.083
What's that other dark beer, not porter?

03:06.375 --> 03:08.000
-Irish beer. Dark.
-Dark beer.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.083
That famous beer brand.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.250
-Guinness.
-Stout?

03:11.333 --> 03:12.916
-No, Guinness.
-Guinness.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.625
-Guinness is the company.
-Right?

03:15.708 --> 03:17.166
Right.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.833
I don't know the specifics.

03:18.916 --> 03:19.875
I see.

03:19.958 --> 03:23.791
I don't know the different types of beer.
I just visited on a tour.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.041
You went to a nice place.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.750
You already emptied a glass?

03:27.250 --> 03:29.708
I was trying to mimic the movies.

03:32.416 --> 03:33.875
It seemed to look kinda cool.

03:33.958 --> 03:37.125
-That's what matters.
-Gotta look the part at a place like this.

03:37.208 --> 03:38.041
It's important.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.958
I already put in a request.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.458
-Yeah.
-You're new here,

03:41.541 --> 03:43.458
so I asked for an introduction.

03:43.541 --> 03:45.708
-Okay.
-When you get here,

03:45.791 --> 03:49.416
you get to learn how beer is made.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.458
That way it tastes better

03:51.541 --> 03:53.541
because you know what you're drinking.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.833
-Hi.
-Hello.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.625
-I'm Park Byeong-Ryun, your guide today.
-Yes.

06:59.708 --> 07:01.291
-I asked for a tour.
-I see.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.333
I'm the head brewer at Budnamu Brewery.

07:03.416 --> 07:05.666
-The what? Head brewer?
-Yes.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.000
It's like how we have
a head chef in a restaurant.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.416
Yes, kinda like that.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.166
You're the top guy. And the boss?

07:11.250 --> 07:12.625
I'm not the boss.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.666
I'm curious. How did you become a brewer?

07:15.750 --> 07:17.208
How long have you been at it?

07:17.291 --> 07:20.500
I've been here for six years now.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.958
-I see.
-Yes.

07:22.041 --> 07:23.375
Shall we get started?

07:23.458 --> 07:27.208
As you can see, this is an old space.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.291
I'll tell you about the space first.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.000
You didn't build it this way?

07:31.083 --> 07:34.750
No, this used to be a takju factory.

07:34.833 --> 07:36.541
Hence the structure.

07:36.625 --> 07:38.291
-Would you come this way?
-Really?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.125
-It's great.
-Do know what a takyu factory is?

07:40.208 --> 07:41.666
He means a makgeolli factory.

07:42.833 --> 07:45.333
-So, it used to be a makgeolli factory.
-The space here

07:45.416 --> 07:47.958
used to be for a makgeolli brewery
back in the day.

07:48.041 --> 07:51.375
That brewery closed
after being in operation for a long time.

07:51.458 --> 07:55.166
Then we moved here
and established this brewery.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.416
Interesting history.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.375
-Yes.
-Making beer at a makgeolli brewery.

07:59.916 --> 08:01.500
-That's cool.
-If you look here,

08:01.583 --> 08:04.083
we planted trees in this space…

08:04.166 --> 08:06.000
-Yes.
-…but in the makgeolli brewery

08:06.083 --> 08:09.625
this is where they made
godubap, cooking and cooling the rice.

08:10.250 --> 08:13.375
They had a frame here
where they'd cool the rice

08:13.458 --> 08:15.833
and the steam would rise.

08:15.916 --> 08:19.541
Then to take that steam outside,
they made an open space there.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.250
Would you like to see
what it looks like outside?

08:22.333 --> 08:23.333
Yes.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.125
Wow, that's amazing.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.416
-Come this way.
-Yeah.

08:32.250 --> 08:36.250
So that steam rising area
is protruded on the roof.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.583
-I've been making a lot of makgeolli.
-I see.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.833
Talking about makgeolli
is like music to my ear.

08:41.916 --> 08:42.916
Like music?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.875
This is our "craft house."

08:44.958 --> 08:47.291
We make barbecue and what not here.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.291
-You make barbecue in-house?
-Yes, we do.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.458
We'll try some later.

08:51.541 --> 08:52.791
-Bar snacks?
-Yup.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.750
Do you like bar snacks?

08:55.833 --> 08:58.708
-That's the reason I drink.
-Same here.

08:59.458 --> 09:00.375
Back in this way.

09:00.458 --> 09:02.833
I also drink so I can eat.

09:04.250 --> 09:05.875
If you come this way,

09:07.625 --> 09:11.791
I'll tell you about the brewing process
and the ingredients

09:11.875 --> 09:14.333
used at our brewery.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.666
We have a space for aging.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.375
-And fermentation.
-We know this.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.250
Yes, it's the oak barrel for wine.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.541
-Yes.
-Here.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.333
Come this way.

09:27.041 --> 09:29.250
I've prepared the beer ingredients.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.791
What are some beer ingredients?

09:33.375 --> 09:35.875
Are you asking me? I know.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.375
I know it all.
If you ask me, I'll get it all.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.791
Try guessing.

09:40.958 --> 09:41.958
This is hop.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.125
Correct.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.916
This is pellet hop.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.083
Yes.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.291
-This is compacted from this?
-Yes.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.791
You'll get the beer smell from this.

09:54.125 --> 09:56.458
That's raw dried hop.

09:56.541 --> 09:58.458
-This was processed.
-I don't smell it.

09:58.541 --> 10:00.333
-Try smelling this one.
-Here.

10:00.416 --> 10:01.333
You'll smell it.

10:01.416 --> 10:04.583
-This I smell.
-If you take one of these

10:05.333 --> 10:07.125
and split in half,

10:07.208 --> 10:10.625
then you see the yellow grains.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.125
Take a look.

10:12.666 --> 10:13.541
Sure.

10:13.625 --> 10:19.500
Those grains bring out the hoppy aroma
and the bitter flavors.

10:20.708 --> 10:23.583
I heard that the more hop in the beer,

10:23.666 --> 10:26.083
the better the foam
is formed and maintained.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.041
Yes, because of the protein.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.541
Guess what this is.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.916
-This looks like barley.
-You got it all.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.708
-It's barley.
-I wasn't sure.

10:33.791 --> 10:37.791
This is the most basic ingredient
called base malt.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.250
This caramel malt has a caramel-like feel.

10:40.333 --> 10:43.083
And this is called roasted malt.

10:43.166 --> 10:44.041
Wanna try some?

10:44.833 --> 10:46.166
This should be more tasty.

10:46.250 --> 10:49.166
Guinness uses this primarily.

10:49.250 --> 10:52.875
-Yeah?
-Dark beer uses slightly roasted barley.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.416
It tastes good.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.041
-Yes.
-This will taste like coffee.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.166
Like cereal.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.750
Some people test the flavor
by baking bread with this

11:01.833 --> 11:03.208
before brewing the beer

11:03.291 --> 11:05.750
to determine the type of beer to make.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.000
-Can you eat this too?
-Sure.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.250
This tastes better.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.708
-I can already tell your beer type.
-What's this one?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.500
Right in the middle.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.500
It has the mildest flavor.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.916
I found out later too

11:21.000 --> 11:24.916
that the color of the beer
is determined by the degree of roasting.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.250
More of dark barley
makes darker colored beer

11:28.333 --> 11:30.416
and the lighter barley for lighter color.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.333
You must be hungry.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.375
I came hungry for this trip.

11:35.458 --> 11:37.083
For dinner.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.750
We then mash this,

11:38.833 --> 11:41.083
mix it with hot water

11:41.166 --> 11:43.708
and begin saccharification.

11:43.791 --> 11:46.291
This has already been saccharified.

11:46.375 --> 11:47.375
-This?
-Yes.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.166
Would you like to try some?

11:50.250 --> 11:52.458
This is what
the elderly calls "malt water."

11:52.541 --> 11:54.166
-Yes.
-Sikhye water.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.958
Stay here for a second.

11:57.041 --> 11:57.875
We stay here.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.333
-Are we already trying some?
-It's not beer yet.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.125
Oh right.

12:07.708 --> 12:08.541
Here.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.875
I haven't had anything to drink
in anticipation for the beer.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.625
So I can really enjoy the beer.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.958
The rumors were right.
You're obsessed with food.

12:20.041 --> 12:22.166
I'm also very curious about food.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.416
-I wish I wasn't.
-Wanna try some?

12:24.500 --> 12:26.666
Why take away such happiness?

12:26.750 --> 12:30.083
This here is the extract from barley
without the sugar

12:30.166 --> 12:32.125
before it turns into alcohol.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.416
It's like sikhye, right?

12:33.916 --> 12:35.083
It's totally sikhye.

12:35.166 --> 12:36.916
Let me give you a hint.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.375
Here.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.166
Smell this first and drink that.
It'll taste like beer.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.958
-Yeah?
-Yup.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.875
Take a sniff and drink this.

12:49.916 --> 12:50.750
Beer, right?

12:51.583 --> 12:52.625
It's still sikhye.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.083
Yeah?

12:55.333 --> 12:57.916
You put this in here
and boil it again, right?

12:58.000 --> 12:58.916
-Correct.
-Boil it?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.708
-If you're done…
-Sure.

13:00.791 --> 13:02.750
It's time for real alcohol.

13:02.833 --> 13:05.416
When the fermentation finishes here,

13:05.500 --> 13:07.125
we age in two different ways.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.916
FERMENTATION TANK

13:09.000 --> 13:10.041
AGING TANK

13:10.125 --> 13:13.458
One in the oak barrels
or directly in the aging tank

13:13.541 --> 13:15.458
to make it cold.

13:15.541 --> 13:17.958
There are
two different types of oak barrels.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.916
Red and white wine oak barrels.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.750
Wanna try some?

13:21.833 --> 13:24.375
-That's why we're here.
-Yes, time for real beer.

13:24.458 --> 13:27.083
Right. Please hold the glass.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.708
Do you drink wine often?

13:29.791 --> 13:31.625
-She's a wine connoisseur.
-Really?

13:33.541 --> 13:34.875
We can't lose.

13:35.541 --> 13:37.666
She's a wine expert and I don't know wine.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.708
-I will open this here.
-Should we get our glasses ready?

13:42.791 --> 13:46.375
When I pull out the nail,
the alcohol will pour out.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.041
-We need to receive it ourselves.
-Yes.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.375
Hold on.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.083
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.541
-Very cool.
-Now we're talking.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.708
-I need a picture.
-Get ready for the pour. One, two, three.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.291
That's right.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.541
We actually…

14:03.625 --> 14:06.000
-Should I pull out?
-Yes.

14:09.375 --> 14:10.750
Then we plug it back in.

14:10.833 --> 14:11.666
What a loss.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.041
This is what we call

14:14.125 --> 14:16.541
-sour beer.
-Sour beer.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.458
It smells sour, like vinegar.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.041
We put it in white wine oak barrel

14:21.125 --> 14:24.375
and work with the bacteria
to make it sour.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.458
This is the trend.

14:25.541 --> 14:27.166
This is a finished beer product?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.625
This is still in the aging process.

14:29.708 --> 14:30.875
So, it's not for sale.

14:30.958 --> 14:34.250
I was disappointed
the first time I tried sour beer.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.083
But apparently this costs more
than regular beer.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.333
I'm glad I don't love it.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.208
-Do we try anything else?
-Right.

14:42.291 --> 14:43.375
That's all for today.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.833
Now we go to the dining room.

14:45.916 --> 14:47.958
Yes, I'll tell you a bit more outside.

14:48.041 --> 14:48.875
Sure.

14:48.958 --> 14:50.791
And that'll wrap up the tour.

14:53.583 --> 14:57.375
On this wall,
you see the posters for our beers.

14:57.458 --> 15:00.416
On the very right is the ojuk bamboo.

15:00.916 --> 15:02.916
-We are…
-Is that ojuk of Ojukheon?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.166
Correct.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.333
-As we mentioned…
-Because it's Gangneung.

15:07.416 --> 15:11.375
…we wanted to make a Korean-style beer
and showcase the local color of Gangneung.

15:11.458 --> 15:12.291
"Zeumeu"?

15:12.375 --> 15:14.750
"Zeumeu" is named after a town

15:14.833 --> 15:16.375
called Zeumeu in Gangneung.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.458
It means the town where the sun sets.

15:18.541 --> 15:19.708
-Sounds foreign.
-Right.

15:19.791 --> 15:23.041
With "blanc" in the name,
it sounds French.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.375
"Blanc" is also the fruity beer.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.375
-Correct.
-I'll try that one too.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.958
So Blanc would normally

15:30.041 --> 15:32.791
use orange zest and coriander seeds,

15:32.875 --> 15:36.750
but we put a new spin on it
and used prickly ash and chrysanthemum.

15:36.833 --> 15:38.500
Prickly ash? Must smell unique.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.416
-Let's try them now.
-Yes.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.833
Now you can go inside.

15:42.916 --> 15:44.333
-Yes.
-Sure.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.000
Enjoy your time in there.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
I'm excited.

15:49.791 --> 15:50.625
Please.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.166
More customers showed up.

16:02.208 --> 16:04.041
For beer,

16:04.666 --> 16:06.541
should we drink what we tried?

16:06.625 --> 16:08.708
What he explained just now
was the fruity one.

16:08.791 --> 16:09.625
Zeumeu Blanc?

16:09.708 --> 16:12.583
Zeumeu Blanc? With the prickly ash.

16:12.666 --> 16:13.625
As for food…

16:15.000 --> 16:16.541
I'll let the expert choose.

16:16.625 --> 16:17.541
Oh, me.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.958
-Pizza sounds good too.
-It does.

16:20.041 --> 16:21.291
One pizza.

16:21.375 --> 16:22.500
Can we order?

16:23.250 --> 16:26.166
-First, we'll take two Zeumeu Blanc.
-Yes.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.666
Pizza for munchies.

16:28.750 --> 16:29.916
Which pizza?

16:30.000 --> 16:30.833
Hong-jae pizza.

16:30.916 --> 16:33.291
The one on the top
is the most popular one.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.416
And barbecue.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.125
One barbecue plate?

16:36.208 --> 16:37.041
Yes.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.125
-Thank you.
-Sure.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.375
Did you fly in from Jeju?

16:40.458 --> 16:41.875
Not today.

16:41.958 --> 16:44.750
-I had a shoot this morning elsewhere.
-Oh, I see.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.041
You're in Jeju often, right?

16:48.375 --> 16:51.416
Not as much as you'd think
but definitely more than before.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.458
I have some businesses to tend to in Jeju.

16:53.541 --> 16:54.458
Of course.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.916
-Here's your beer.
-Nice glass.

17:33.166 --> 17:34.250
-Pretty, right?
-Yes.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.416
A goblet, right?

17:35.500 --> 17:36.708
-A goblet.
-See?

17:37.916 --> 17:40.333
-How many milliliters?
-Gotta memorize a few.

17:40.416 --> 17:42.416
-Shape of a goblet.
-About 400ml.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.583
This is 400ml?

17:43.666 --> 17:45.833
-Do you sell the glass?
-We do.

17:45.916 --> 17:46.750
What's this?

17:47.750 --> 17:48.791
-Sticker.
-Sticker.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.416
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.458
Let's drink it now.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.833
It's best when it's freshly served.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.375
It's good.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.416
Is it extra special for us?

18:09.500 --> 18:10.750
Wow, this is tasty.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.375
Right?

18:12.458 --> 18:13.625
Yum.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.875
I think beer is all about the first sip.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.291
I smell fruit.

18:25.708 --> 18:26.875
Like Hoegaarden.

18:26.958 --> 18:30.541
Hoegaarden or that French beer.
Something blanc.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.625
This is also called Blanc
so there's a similar note of fruit.

18:52.291 --> 18:55.500
Do you like beer when it snows

18:55.583 --> 18:57.541
or when it's hot outside?

18:57.625 --> 18:59.791
For our generation,
it's better in the heat.

18:59.875 --> 19:03.708
But this kind of flavor
works well with the snow, doesn't it?

19:05.500 --> 19:07.125
It matches with the snow.

19:07.708 --> 19:09.583
-Even though it's cold.
-Yes.

19:35.916 --> 19:37.541
Pretty glasses. I should buy it.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.416
Can't you use a wine glass?

19:39.500 --> 19:42.000
Use a small white wine glass.

19:43.541 --> 19:46.750
-I'm a bit of a minimalist.
-No need for formalities.

19:47.333 --> 19:50.750
Not at all. I like to keep it simple.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.541
I like beer glasses.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.666
The shaker glass comes up like this.

19:54.750 --> 19:55.916
I like those.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.416
This is called a goblet.

19:58.958 --> 20:02.625
I prefer the ones that go straight up.

20:04.541 --> 20:06.875
GOBLET

20:11.041 --> 20:12.875
SHAKER PINT

20:15.583 --> 20:17.375
TULIP

20:20.000 --> 20:22.083
PILSNER

20:24.541 --> 20:26.250
MUG

20:28.833 --> 20:30.625
WEIZEN

20:34.000 --> 20:36.583
Do you drink a lot of beer at home?

20:36.666 --> 20:39.583
After I work out, sometimes.

20:40.583 --> 20:41.708
Working out.

20:41.791 --> 20:43.125
You exercise a lot, right?

20:43.208 --> 20:44.916
More than two hours a day?

20:45.000 --> 20:48.125
The line between exercise and house chores

20:48.208 --> 20:50.208
is blurry for me.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.375
I just put on a workout outfit
and stay in it all day.

20:53.958 --> 20:55.541
That's my exercise.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.625
Spinning in the morning.

20:58.125 --> 21:02.666
-I haven't exercised in… almost 20 days.
-Yeah?

21:02.750 --> 21:04.083
Twenty days.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.000
Washing rice is an exercise.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.625
That's what I tell myself

21:09.125 --> 21:10.708
to keep me comforted.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.208
"I am exercising now."

21:13.041 --> 21:13.958
Frankly, it's not.

22:18.541 --> 22:21.375
BARBECUE

24:17.125 --> 24:17.958
Enjoy.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.375
You can wrap it in the tortilla.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.666
-Thank you.
-Looks good.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.666
This deserves a picture.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.375
I know it's corny, but I need a picture.

24:30.875 --> 24:31.916
Nice.

24:35.083 --> 24:36.791
-Can we take one together?
-What?

24:36.875 --> 24:38.750
I guess that's the trend.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.083
-You'll appreciate it later.
-True.

24:44.791 --> 24:46.750
Nice to meet you, once again.

24:46.833 --> 24:47.666
Of course.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.750
Is that cabbage at the bottom?

24:50.833 --> 24:52.416
No, this is called pulled pork.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.041
It's pork ripped apart.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.791
-Oh, this?
-Yes.

24:56.291 --> 24:57.375
Where do we start?

24:57.875 --> 25:00.125
-I'm gonna follow you.
-Probably the ribs.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.833
I'll do the same. Like that? Okay.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.500
We should use our hands for this.

25:05.583 --> 25:06.916
-Right?
-Yes.

25:08.750 --> 25:09.583
Amazing.

25:10.583 --> 25:12.333
-It looks delicious.
-Eat up.

25:19.916 --> 25:20.750
Is it good?

25:22.625 --> 25:23.458
Yummy?

25:23.958 --> 25:24.833
So delicious.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.875
I tend to drink the beer first

25:32.333 --> 25:34.208
and eat before the flavor dissipates.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.166
I've been doing the opposite.

25:38.916 --> 25:40.000
It's just my style.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.416
Let me try.

25:45.041 --> 25:47.958
I definitely drink beer for the food.

25:48.541 --> 25:49.458
Both, for me.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.916
-Isn't it so good?
-It is.

25:57.958 --> 26:00.583
And they bring out
chonggak-baek-kimchi instead of pickles.

26:15.291 --> 26:17.250
-Back in the day…
-Yeah.

26:17.333 --> 26:18.666
…in the '80s.

26:19.250 --> 26:21.125
Early or mid '80s?

26:21.208 --> 26:22.708
-Entering class of '85?
-Yes.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.500
-Same here.
-I see.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.583
It's gone now.

26:25.666 --> 26:27.708
Remember Danseongsa
and Piccadilly Theaters?

26:27.791 --> 26:28.625
Yes.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.583
Next to Piccadilly was a big restaurant.

26:30.666 --> 26:32.625
There was a big restaurant there?

26:32.708 --> 26:34.958
I saw you there, from afar.

26:35.625 --> 26:36.583
Really?

26:36.666 --> 26:39.250
I was a fan then
because you were a famous actor.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.416
Was I eating there?

26:41.500 --> 26:42.500
Probably eating.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.000
Why was I there?

26:44.791 --> 26:46.541
There was a loud crowd

26:48.000 --> 26:51.250
so I was like, "Who's here?"
It was a sensation.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.250
Everyone in our age group

26:53.750 --> 26:56.083
had a picture of you.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.583
-You went to Chung-Ang University?
-Yes.

26:58.666 --> 27:00.666
-The Anseong campus.
-Yes.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.750
My friend was a photography major there.

27:05.208 --> 27:08.458
I used to go visit him

27:08.958 --> 27:11.875
in hopes of seeing someone famous
in the theater and film major.

27:12.583 --> 27:15.041
-Particularly you and Jeon In-hwa.
-Right.

27:16.250 --> 27:17.541
Let's see.

27:18.125 --> 27:20.291
-What month were you born?
-September.

27:22.541 --> 27:24.500
-What about you?
-April.

27:24.583 --> 27:26.125
I entered the class a year early.

27:26.208 --> 27:27.541
-Year of the sheep?
-Sheep.

27:31.041 --> 27:33.208
I always ask when I meet a peer.

27:34.375 --> 27:36.083
Where in Chungcheong are you from?

27:36.166 --> 27:37.000
Yesan.

27:38.458 --> 27:39.416
And you?

27:40.875 --> 27:41.833
Seoul.

27:41.916 --> 27:43.208
-Originally from Seoul?
-Yes.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.500
My father's from Jeju.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.708
-You have kids, right?
-What?

27:47.791 --> 27:48.958
-Children.
-Yes.

27:49.041 --> 27:51.833
-How old are they?
-My kids are in college.

27:52.666 --> 27:54.583
You've been married for a while then.

27:55.166 --> 27:59.000
My eldest
just started elementary school today.

27:59.625 --> 28:00.958
-Your oldest kid?
-Yes.

28:03.708 --> 28:05.708
As he was getting dressed this morning

28:06.291 --> 28:07.291
and left for school,

28:07.875 --> 28:09.291
I choked up a bit.

28:10.250 --> 28:11.083
Thank you.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.250
How old is your youngest?

28:13.333 --> 28:14.791
She's four.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.083
The middle one is seven.

28:16.166 --> 28:17.250
How many kids?

28:17.333 --> 28:18.916
-Two.
-They aren't kids anymore.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.583
They're still like babies to me.

28:21.666 --> 28:23.583
If they're in college,
they can drink with you.

28:23.666 --> 28:25.916
They won't, even though I want to.

28:26.416 --> 28:27.625
That's a parent's dream.

28:27.708 --> 28:29.750
-It is.
-I wish

28:29.833 --> 28:32.583
I could drink with my kids one day.

28:33.833 --> 28:36.458
But it must not taste good
to drink with mom and dad.

28:37.333 --> 28:40.208
For me, it's not about "when do they
grow up to go to college."

28:40.291 --> 28:41.958
I want to have a drink with them.

28:42.458 --> 28:44.458
I think I was like that too.

28:45.208 --> 28:48.125
But they grow up so fast.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.541
I gotta take the sticker with me.

29:05.583 --> 29:07.875
They'll like it
if you bring them the sticker.

29:08.375 --> 29:10.000
The younger crowd collects this.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.333
I collect them.

29:14.125 --> 29:15.750
This is the trend.

29:15.833 --> 29:18.583
You visit the local breweries,

29:18.666 --> 29:20.708
collect the stickers

29:20.791 --> 29:22.666
and put it on your laptop.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.750
-Young people trend.
-Like wineries.

29:24.833 --> 29:27.041
They sell these at some wineries.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.208
You buy it at each brewery

29:29.291 --> 29:31.375
and put it on your laptop or luggage.

30:47.625 --> 30:48.750
Do you cook at home?

30:49.458 --> 30:51.166
I do all the cooking.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.541
You must be good.

30:53.208 --> 30:54.541
I'm not good.

30:55.666 --> 30:57.750
I just rough something out.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.791
It's embarrassing to say this

31:00.291 --> 31:03.666
-in front of you.
-What?

31:03.750 --> 31:07.083
I just add heat to fresh ingredients.

31:07.583 --> 31:09.875
-But my palate…
-Yeah.

31:10.875 --> 31:12.500
…is not too sophisticated.

31:15.583 --> 31:18.041
-Did you just laugh at me?
-Nah.

31:19.958 --> 31:21.500
Excuse me. Here's your pizza.

31:21.583 --> 31:22.666
Oh my God.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.666
What kind of a pizza is this?

31:26.750 --> 31:28.875
-This is called Hong-jae pizza.
-What's in it?

31:28.958 --> 31:32.250
Bacon smoked in-house.

31:32.333 --> 31:35.666
It's named Hong-jae pizza
because we are in Hongjae-dong.

31:36.166 --> 31:38.875
It's the kimchi
made at a factory in Hongjae-dong.

31:38.958 --> 31:40.833
-This is kimchi pizza?
-Yes, it is.

31:40.916 --> 31:42.125
It's Korean-style pizza.

31:42.208 --> 31:45.875
Korean pizza garners attention overseas.

31:45.958 --> 31:47.833
People find it fascinating.

31:47.916 --> 31:48.750
Why?

31:49.250 --> 31:50.958
The toppings are unique.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.666
You know the Korean style pizza.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.291
There's cheese in the crust.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.333
-Right.
-Sweet potato mousse.

31:56.416 --> 31:57.666
-Korean style.
-Only here.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.750
They categorize it as K-pizza.

31:59.833 --> 32:00.666
Enjoy.

32:01.958 --> 32:04.875
Only Koreans would think of putting
kimchi on top of pizza.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.333
Italians would be shocked to see this.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.416
MR. ITALY

32:30.958 --> 32:35.708
MR. KOREA

33:36.166 --> 33:39.375
PIZZA

34:08.541 --> 34:09.583
Try this.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.666
I should give it to you.

34:13.750 --> 34:16.166
Don't mention it.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.750
I see you haven't been to New York.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.833
-Oh?
-This is how New Yorkers eat pizza.

34:30.625 --> 34:33.083
I was reaching for the fork and knife.

34:33.166 --> 34:35.375
-How's this?
-It's unique.

34:37.458 --> 34:40.958
-Tastes like kimchi-bokkeumbap.
-It's got some Korean flavor.

34:42.083 --> 34:44.875
-I'm gonna eat like you.
-Interesting interpretation of pizza.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.000
-It's unique. I like it.
-Yeah?

34:58.958 --> 35:02.166
I learned pizza the way you did,
at the Pizza Hut in Itaewon.

35:02.666 --> 35:04.125
Pizza Hut.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.916
That was in the mid '80s

35:06.750 --> 35:08.166
when you needed reservation.

35:08.250 --> 35:10.833
When Pizza Hut first came out,
it was so good.

35:12.041 --> 35:13.875
It was completely new to me.

35:14.458 --> 35:16.708
I had never had food like it before.

35:29.250 --> 35:31.416
-You seem to like it.
-Yes, it's good.

35:33.750 --> 35:34.833
This…

35:34.916 --> 35:37.500
Craft brewery culture is a recent trend.

35:37.583 --> 35:38.875
Only in the 2000s

35:40.291 --> 35:43.541
did craft beer gain popularity
with FIFA World Cup.

35:43.625 --> 35:44.958
So recently,

35:45.041 --> 35:48.416
I tried an ale and it was bitter
and wondered why it was popular.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.625
As a food expert,

35:51.125 --> 35:53.083
I need to be able to answer when asked.

35:53.166 --> 35:54.625
So, I started studying.

35:54.708 --> 35:56.458
I actually hate studying.

35:56.541 --> 36:00.625
I just like eating.
But I study wine and beer regardless,

36:00.708 --> 36:02.833
even though I don't like studying.

36:02.916 --> 36:05.083
-It helps me drink less.
-How come?

36:05.166 --> 36:06.791
Otherwise, I'd get drunk.

36:06.875 --> 36:09.833
I'd get wasted
if I chugged 500cc like I used to.

36:09.916 --> 36:12.250
This is important.
There are steps for wine.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.791
-Yes.
-Same for beer.

36:13.875 --> 36:16.500
You gotta listen to this.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.541
At first,
you need to look at the appearance.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.625
Look at the color.

36:22.958 --> 36:25.166
The foam, which is called the "head."

36:25.250 --> 36:26.291
See how the foam is.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.291
It's similar to wine.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.250
So, first, you look at the appearance.

36:36.333 --> 36:39.208
For example, "This is dark beer."

36:39.291 --> 36:43.083
Then, "This has a thick foam."

36:43.166 --> 36:45.708
"This is slightly creamy."
So that's appearance.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
THE ELEMENTS OF BEER

36:49.041 --> 36:50.833
Then you smell the aroma.

36:52.791 --> 36:55.250
It's got a grainy smell, right?

37:02.416 --> 37:03.250
Next is flavor.

37:03.333 --> 37:06.250
Along with the scent
that reaches your nose as you take a sip.

37:06.333 --> 37:07.291
You enjoy the flavor.

37:07.375 --> 37:12.500
I DESERVE TO DIE TODAY
BUT I DO WANT BEER

37:12.583 --> 37:14.458
You enjoy the scent through your nose

37:14.958 --> 37:17.416
and then there's the mouthfeel.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.041
The way it feels in your mouth.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.250
It's delicious.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.083
And finally, there's the overall review.

37:35.583 --> 37:36.666
What's interesting is

37:37.333 --> 37:41.250
if you try to drink it in that order,
it's hard to keep up.

37:41.333 --> 37:44.166
Who thinks of mouthfeel
as they drink beer?

37:44.250 --> 37:46.458
But when you try to feel it,

37:48.208 --> 37:50.208
it's a different experience.

37:50.875 --> 37:53.083
-Shall we try another one?
-A different one.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.333
What should we order?

37:54.833 --> 37:56.166
-Dark beer?
-Yes.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.375
Let's try a bitter one.

37:58.458 --> 38:01.458
6.5 ABV. Slightly higher than this one.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.708
Sir.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.166
How may I help you?

38:08.708 --> 38:10.208
-Do you have the porter?
-Yup.

38:10.291 --> 38:11.666
-Two glasses, please.
-Sure.

39:11.708 --> 39:13.708
-Will you hold up the glass first?
-Yeah.

39:14.208 --> 39:15.166
It's black.

39:16.083 --> 39:18.083
-I'll clear the finished--
-Is this 6.5%?

39:19.041 --> 39:20.041
6.5% ABV.

39:21.375 --> 39:22.250
Enjoy.

39:32.541 --> 39:33.375
It's good.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.125
I don't know beer very well

39:39.208 --> 39:40.333
but this is special.

39:40.916 --> 39:42.125
Don't you agree?

39:42.208 --> 39:43.333
Yes, it's good.

39:44.041 --> 39:45.208
This is special.

39:47.541 --> 39:49.416
Do you prefer this or the one before?

39:50.875 --> 39:52.541
They're so different.

39:53.916 --> 39:56.333
The one earlier was easier to drink.

39:57.666 --> 40:00.916
This I would pair with a steak dinner

40:01.666 --> 40:02.750
or something fancier.

40:03.708 --> 40:05.916
If I have to put it in words.

40:06.625 --> 40:07.500
Yummy.

40:07.583 --> 40:11.250
But this isn't something
I can just drink casually.

40:11.791 --> 40:12.666
It's a bit heavy.

40:12.750 --> 40:14.916
-Like for specific occasions.
-Right.

40:27.750 --> 40:30.958
It's good. Not as strong as whiskey

40:31.916 --> 40:32.958
or wine,

40:33.041 --> 40:37.041
but it's almost like an iced Americano.

40:38.208 --> 40:39.291
It's refreshing.

40:45.291 --> 40:48.791
It tastes like strong coffee in beer.

40:48.875 --> 40:50.333
-A hint of chocolate.
-Chocolate.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.666
This is called "porter."

41:03.166 --> 41:05.166
As for the origin of its name,

41:05.875 --> 41:07.791
there are two theories.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.583
A person who carries your luggage
is a porter.

41:10.666 --> 41:13.041
This used to be beer favored by porters.

41:13.125 --> 41:14.500
That's one theory.

41:15.208 --> 41:16.250
The other theory

41:16.333 --> 41:20.166
is that they'd deliver this to a bar
and say, "Porter."

41:21.125 --> 41:23.875
As he carried it in,
he'd announce himself.

41:23.958 --> 41:26.500
He's put it down saying, "Porter!"
and the name stuck.

41:26.583 --> 41:28.458
THEORY

41:28.541 --> 41:31.250
It doesn't change the taste
but it's nice to know the story.

41:31.875 --> 41:34.750
From the flavor,
you'd think the calorie count is high.

41:34.833 --> 41:36.041
But it's actually not.

41:36.125 --> 41:38.583
Dark beer gets a misnomer from the flavor.

41:38.666 --> 41:41.458
It smells like chocolate
so, people think it's high calorie.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.125
But as you saw earlier,

41:43.958 --> 41:47.125
the color just depends
on how you roast the hop.

41:47.958 --> 41:50.958
At first,
they would just roast over open fire.

41:51.041 --> 41:53.041
But it was hard
to control the fire that way

41:53.125 --> 41:56.125
and hard to get even colors
with lots of burnt hops.

41:56.208 --> 41:59.458
The earlier beer
all had dark colors like this.

41:59.541 --> 42:01.666
Then, after the industrial revolution,

42:01.750 --> 42:03.916
coal made it easy to control the fire.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.916
People started roasting the hop
according to their preferences.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.041
A theory is that that's when the colors
became lighter.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.166
THEORY

42:11.250 --> 42:13.791
This is so good,
but I'm getting drunk on this.

42:15.333 --> 42:16.666
-Recently…
-Yeah.

42:16.750 --> 42:17.958
In the seafood market…

42:18.458 --> 42:21.208
What's that called? In-shell oysters?

42:21.291 --> 42:23.083
I steamed those and it was so good.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.583
-Steamed?
-Yes.

42:24.666 --> 42:26.625
Those are hard to shuck.

42:26.708 --> 42:28.416
But once you steam it, it opens up

42:28.500 --> 42:30.208
and is easy to eat.

42:32.125 --> 42:34.791
I can't believe I'm having
this conversation with you.

42:34.875 --> 42:36.375
-Not at all.
-Who am I to talk?

42:36.458 --> 42:38.000
I'm trying to keep reference.

42:40.583 --> 42:42.625
It's the alcohol talking.

42:42.708 --> 42:43.833
I'm sorry.

42:44.583 --> 42:46.208
To be honest,

42:46.291 --> 42:49.250
it's not like
only cooking experts cook and eat.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.666
Even if you suck at cooking,
you can still cook and eat.

42:51.750 --> 42:55.541
Single handicap or 100, anyone can golf.

42:55.625 --> 42:56.791
Did I say anything?

42:59.458 --> 43:00.500
Do you golf?

43:00.583 --> 43:02.208
-I like it.
-I quit.

43:02.875 --> 43:04.291
But you used to?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.666
I was a single-digit handicapper.

43:08.041 --> 43:09.541
How many years ago?

43:11.041 --> 43:14.166
I've been married ten years
so, it's about seven or eight years ago.

43:14.250 --> 43:17.000
-Before you married?
-Before I got married, then I quit.

43:17.583 --> 43:18.416
The thing is,

43:19.375 --> 43:21.583
golf takes up too much time.

43:21.666 --> 43:22.958
I quit smoking too.

43:24.166 --> 43:26.041
For the same reason.

43:26.125 --> 43:29.500
I was really into recipe making then.

43:30.458 --> 43:31.625
What's interesting

43:32.458 --> 43:35.583
is that 20 days after I quit smoking,

43:35.666 --> 43:37.291
when I ate at a restaurant,

43:37.375 --> 43:40.333
and I kid you not,
I could picture a genome map of the food.

43:40.416 --> 43:42.291
Things I couldn't taste before,

43:42.375 --> 43:43.958
I could taste now.

43:44.625 --> 43:47.875
So I would try to mimic the food
at home or at the restaurant

43:47.958 --> 43:49.333
and I can recreate the flavor.

43:49.416 --> 43:50.666
That was really amazing.

43:51.250 --> 43:54.625
The year after I quit smoking
I came up with a huge list of menu.

43:54.708 --> 43:56.416
I operate several brands now.

43:56.500 --> 43:57.583
Franchises.

43:57.666 --> 43:59.833
All the franchise brands were made then.

43:59.916 --> 44:01.958
I was told not to tell this story.

44:02.041 --> 44:05.125
Quitting smoking means
you are one hell of a dogged person.

44:05.208 --> 44:07.958
-Someone not to deal with.
-Nah.

44:08.041 --> 44:09.500
There's that famous story.

44:09.583 --> 44:13.708
Someone quit smoking
and was told, "You are a tough one."

44:13.791 --> 44:16.250
-So I shouldn't talk about it.
-Then the guy said,

44:16.333 --> 44:19.166
"You are worse for not quitting."

44:19.250 --> 44:20.500
That makes sense too.

44:20.583 --> 44:21.666
Sure.

44:21.750 --> 44:24.708
It's like they used to say
the milk delivery man is more fit

44:24.791 --> 44:27.083
than the one drinking the milk.

44:28.500 --> 44:29.375
That makes sense.

44:29.458 --> 44:32.166
People call me dogged
for working out all the time,

44:32.250 --> 44:34.125
but not exercising makes you worse.

44:34.916 --> 44:35.833
Is that so?

44:40.708 --> 44:42.500
How about another round?

44:42.583 --> 44:44.000
What? Beer?

44:45.750 --> 44:47.375
"Gyeongpo Double IPA."

44:47.458 --> 44:49.291
It's twice the ABV at 8.4%.

44:49.375 --> 44:50.666
Let's try that.

45:19.666 --> 45:21.875
Excuse me, here's your beer.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.958
I'll put it on the side.

45:25.875 --> 45:27.375
New glasses.

45:40.708 --> 45:42.041
I know it's stronger,

45:42.125 --> 45:43.416
but it's so good.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.083
You like rich flavors.

45:45.166 --> 45:47.541
-It's delicious.
-Very rich flavor.

45:55.166 --> 45:56.875
There's a floral aroma.

45:57.958 --> 46:00.791
Different people smell different things.

46:02.833 --> 46:04.083
You smell flowers?

46:04.166 --> 46:06.666
-Now that you say it, I do.
-Totally like flowers.

46:06.750 --> 46:09.125
I'm not good at these things
but this is flower.

46:11.541 --> 46:12.666
I smell flowers, yes.

46:13.500 --> 46:15.583
It's like the stem of a flower.

46:15.666 --> 46:17.083
A bouquet of flowers.

46:36.208 --> 46:37.750
This beer is something.

46:38.333 --> 46:40.833
The scent and everything

46:41.875 --> 46:43.958
is so fresh

46:44.041 --> 46:45.916
that you feel it right away.

46:50.833 --> 46:52.208
There's a German saying.

46:53.083 --> 46:56.541
"Beer is best when drunk
under the shades of brewery chimney."

46:56.625 --> 46:58.291
That's where we are.

46:59.708 --> 47:02.208
-Brewery.
-Just like food, fresh.

47:02.875 --> 47:04.208
Like makgeolli.

47:04.291 --> 47:06.583
Compared to the usual canned beer,

47:06.666 --> 47:08.666
this is completely different.

47:09.458 --> 47:12.125
Categorically different.

47:13.958 --> 47:16.291
After this, the regular beer would…

47:16.375 --> 47:17.666
-Now…
-Different, right?

47:17.750 --> 47:19.333
Beer won't be the same anymore.

47:19.875 --> 47:20.875
But these days

47:21.625 --> 47:27.083
there are many microbreweries
that produce and sell their own beer.

47:27.833 --> 47:28.708
It's fun.

47:29.208 --> 47:33.000
It's about finding your style.

47:33.083 --> 47:34.708
I came here and asked,

47:34.791 --> 47:36.333
"What's the most popular?"

47:36.416 --> 47:38.541
That's old style. To drink what's popular.

47:39.041 --> 47:40.125
These days,

47:41.083 --> 47:43.791
people seek what tastes good to them.

47:43.875 --> 47:45.625
Consumption by preference.

47:45.708 --> 47:48.125
I don't have a preference.

47:48.208 --> 47:50.708
What did you like the best
from today's selections?

47:50.791 --> 47:52.291
Which is your style?

47:52.916 --> 47:55.083
I think this is your type.

47:56.375 --> 47:57.750
-No, because…
-No?

47:57.833 --> 48:00.666
It's like, there's time, place,
and occasion for fashion.

48:01.375 --> 48:03.166
Likewise, this depends.

48:03.250 --> 48:06.500
What we had at first
is for a casual occasion.

48:07.250 --> 48:08.125
For any occasion.

48:08.208 --> 48:10.083
After a workout or anything.

48:11.375 --> 48:14.500
The second one, porter.

48:15.791 --> 48:17.875
When it's too early for dinner

48:17.958 --> 48:19.875
-but I'm a bit hungry.
-Right.

48:19.958 --> 48:22.833
Then, I'd go for the porter.

48:23.333 --> 48:25.333
Then one day, I might be feeling down.

48:26.083 --> 48:28.625
But it's a hassle to go out

48:28.708 --> 48:31.041
and I want a drink at home.

48:31.125 --> 48:32.833
Then I would choose this.

48:33.333 --> 48:36.041
You're right. It depends.

48:36.916 --> 48:38.375
What a great way to put it.

48:38.916 --> 48:39.833
Thank you.

48:41.416 --> 48:44.458
When it's pouring outside,
raining cats and dogs.

48:44.541 --> 48:45.458
Yes.

48:46.083 --> 48:49.958
Don't you love those moments?
You turn on some music, grab a glass

48:51.000 --> 48:53.250
and watch the rain or the snow fall.

48:54.041 --> 48:55.458
-Drinking…
-Wait.

48:56.375 --> 48:58.208
-Do you like daytime drinking?
-Me?

48:58.291 --> 48:59.166
-Yes.
-Sure, I do.

49:00.750 --> 49:01.666
I see.

49:01.750 --> 49:04.083
We call it daytime drinking,

49:04.166 --> 49:06.375
but kids call it natmaek or "day beer."

49:07.250 --> 49:09.083
It's a made-up word. "Natmaek."

49:09.166 --> 49:12.666
-As you enter here, there's a bookstore.
-Yes.

49:12.750 --> 49:16.125
The highlight of this space
is chaekmaek or "book and beer."

49:16.625 --> 49:17.541
Do you get it?

49:18.041 --> 49:19.333
First time I heard it today.

49:19.416 --> 49:21.625
-Reading a book while drinking beer?
-I know.

49:21.708 --> 49:24.250
-You get tipsy.
-Reading alone makes you sleepy.

49:24.333 --> 49:25.916
-Right.
-You add beer to that.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.041
There's also conmaek,
enjoying media contents with beer.

49:29.125 --> 49:30.000
Anything goes.

49:30.083 --> 49:31.916
-For us, we watch TV…
-What contents?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.333
-TV contents.
-Oh, "contents and beer."

49:34.416 --> 49:36.708
For us, it's just drinking
while watching TV.

49:36.791 --> 49:38.458
But kids call it conmaek.

49:38.541 --> 49:40.333
Beer with media contents.

49:40.416 --> 49:42.500
I've never heard of "book and beer."

49:42.583 --> 49:44.166
It's a real thing.

49:46.833 --> 49:49.416
NATMAEK, DAY BEER

49:54.541 --> 49:56.541
CONMAEK, CONTENTS AND BEER

50:08.708 --> 50:11.083
GOLMAEK, GOLF AND BEER

50:21.708 --> 50:24.458
YAMAEK, BASEBALL AND BEER

50:42.041 --> 50:44.458
Beer is more fun when drunk together.

50:45.583 --> 50:47.125
-While cheering.
-Yes.

50:47.208 --> 50:49.083
Time for more beer.

50:57.916 --> 51:00.750
-How do you choose your clothes?
-My wife does it for me.

51:00.833 --> 51:01.750
-Always?
-Yes.

51:02.250 --> 51:05.041
My nickname used to be
"best worst dresser."

51:05.791 --> 51:07.833
-What's that?
-Best worst dresser.

51:07.916 --> 51:10.083
What's that?

51:10.166 --> 51:11.208
For example,

51:11.291 --> 51:14.208
I'd buy from a single brand
before I got married.

51:14.291 --> 51:17.333
If something was famous,
I'd buy all of their clothes.

51:18.250 --> 51:21.208
When Dolce & Gabbana was popular,
all I wore was Dolce.

51:21.291 --> 51:23.833
When Armani suits were popular,

51:23.916 --> 51:25.583
I owned maybe 50-60 Armani suits.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.500
You had some interest, though.

51:27.583 --> 51:29.208
To shop that way.

51:29.291 --> 51:30.625
I'm from the countryside,

51:31.583 --> 51:33.791
so I didn't want to look tacky.

51:35.125 --> 51:38.541
You can laugh. That's how I was.
Thankfully, I don't have pictures.

51:39.250 --> 51:42.875
Anyway, since I dressed that way,

51:42.958 --> 51:45.083
my wife had a blast.

51:45.791 --> 51:47.208
I was like that.

51:47.791 --> 51:48.708
For me…

51:50.500 --> 51:52.041
I started working

51:52.125 --> 51:54.041
when I was young, since high school.

51:55.041 --> 51:59.166
I was always receiving attention
and it became a disease.

51:59.250 --> 52:00.083
Right.

52:02.041 --> 52:03.875
Victimized? Paranoia?

52:03.958 --> 52:06.416
Really?
Don't you usually enjoy the attention?

52:06.500 --> 52:08.958
-I was too young.
-I see.

52:09.458 --> 52:11.041
I thought it'd be the opposite.

52:11.125 --> 52:12.916
That's good to feel that way.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.291
You had a thorough understanding
of who you were…

52:16.375 --> 52:17.208
Yes.

52:18.250 --> 52:21.083
…and had plenty of social experience

52:21.166 --> 52:24.208
and a chance to grow into a person
before you were known.

52:24.291 --> 52:26.541
For me, that wasn't true.

52:26.625 --> 52:28.291
-Ego was yet to mature.
-I was 15.

52:28.375 --> 52:29.833
-Yes.
-You debuted at 15?

52:29.916 --> 52:31.083
Was it 16?

52:31.166 --> 52:33.375
So I always had this paranoia

52:33.458 --> 52:35.125
and avoided people.

52:35.208 --> 52:37.958
I dressed in dark clothes

52:39.250 --> 52:42.583
so I wouldn't be noticeable,
always worrying about not being noticed.

52:42.666 --> 52:46.250
So I would always wear
gray and black clothes.

52:46.333 --> 52:47.166
Right.

52:47.708 --> 52:52.250
Then a person that I respect
once told me I looked like a prosecutor.

52:52.333 --> 52:53.958
That I always wore dark clothes.

52:54.041 --> 52:55.625
I would think, "It's my style."

52:55.708 --> 52:58.000
"Why should they tell me
to dress more colorfully?"

52:58.083 --> 53:00.916
I would think that.

53:01.625 --> 53:04.000
Then about three years ago,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.625
I met a friend who's a nun that I admire

53:11.000 --> 53:12.083
in Busan.

53:12.166 --> 53:15.416
She told me to visit

53:15.500 --> 53:17.208
when I'm in Busan.

53:18.958 --> 53:20.458
I was having a hard time then.

53:20.541 --> 53:22.541
So I decided to visit the cathedral

53:22.625 --> 53:24.166
and pay her a visit.

53:24.250 --> 53:27.583
I thought it'd help me find peace.

53:28.333 --> 53:31.166
I wanted to look nice
so I dressed in black and white.

53:31.250 --> 53:33.250
Again? Black and white?

53:35.125 --> 53:35.958
Yes.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.666
So I went.

53:39.750 --> 53:43.041
As soon as she sees me, she says…

53:43.125 --> 53:44.208
"Are you a nun?"

53:46.333 --> 53:48.041
-How'd you know?
-I mean…

53:48.125 --> 53:49.166
Black and white.

53:49.666 --> 53:53.916
"I thought I'd get to see a fancy actor
and you come dressed like a nun."

53:54.000 --> 53:55.458
That's what she said.

53:55.541 --> 53:57.125
I was devastated.

53:57.208 --> 54:00.000
I just wanted some peace of mind.

54:00.083 --> 54:01.416
And here was a sister

54:01.500 --> 54:05.166
who was talking
like people of the secular world.

54:05.250 --> 54:06.750
I was disappointed.

54:06.833 --> 54:08.791
-Right.
-I was hurt.

54:09.666 --> 54:10.750
Very disappointed.

54:12.625 --> 54:14.125
-I thought about it.
-Right.

54:14.750 --> 54:17.833
And after some time,

54:18.791 --> 54:19.791
I realized

54:21.958 --> 54:24.875
that I was not accepting me for who I was.

54:27.625 --> 54:30.583
I didn't acknowledge me for who I was.

54:31.416 --> 54:34.375
I am an actor
and people expect to see me a certain way.

54:34.458 --> 54:36.375
I'm an actor.

54:40.208 --> 54:42.041
They say in English, "Be yourself."

54:42.125 --> 54:43.291
Yes.

54:43.375 --> 54:45.583
I wasn't being myself.

54:45.666 --> 54:46.875
For who I was.

54:48.208 --> 54:50.875
What does that make
of my 30 years as an actor?

54:50.958 --> 54:53.750
As an actor…

54:53.833 --> 54:54.666
Right.

54:54.750 --> 54:57.750
I should shine
and accept myself for who I am.

54:57.833 --> 54:59.708
I didn't do anything wrong.

54:59.791 --> 55:03.875
I shouldn't have to hide
or be worried about getting noticed.

55:03.958 --> 55:05.791
That made me feel so much better.

55:05.875 --> 55:07.791
Since then,

55:07.875 --> 55:10.458
-I wear more colorful clothes.
-I see.

55:10.541 --> 55:11.625
Even today…

55:13.958 --> 55:17.625
I'm wearing pink.
Still not too much of it, though.

55:41.125 --> 55:43.125
Hi, I'm 24 years old.

55:43.208 --> 55:44.250
Hi, I'm--

55:44.333 --> 55:45.958
Hi, I'm Han Hyeon-jun, an actor.

55:46.041 --> 55:48.000
I'm 49, Kim Hak-jin.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.750
I'm Park Jeong-eun, a drummer.

55:49.833 --> 55:51.833
I'm 21, Ryu Jung-won.

55:51.916 --> 55:54.416
The way I express myself…

55:54.500 --> 55:56.083
…is through a camera or a bass?

55:56.166 --> 55:58.291
-My bed.
-Confidence.

55:58.375 --> 55:59.708
Pictures in my phone.

55:59.791 --> 56:00.625
My cat.

56:01.750 --> 56:04.208
I live with six cats. Here, too.

56:04.291 --> 56:05.708
"My today

56:05.791 --> 56:08.791
is the tomorrow
so desired by the yesterday's dead."

56:08.875 --> 56:12.375
I want to be an inspiration to others.

56:12.458 --> 56:14.500
I want to continue doing music.

56:14.583 --> 56:16.500
I want to be able to listen to everyone.

56:16.583 --> 56:18.250
Someone smart and kind.

56:18.333 --> 56:19.875
I want to be someone confident.

56:19.958 --> 56:22.458
"She's got a kind heart."

56:22.541 --> 56:24.500
I want to be a great father.

57:01.333 --> 57:02.791
So, that felt nice.

57:02.875 --> 57:04.416
-Recently.
-I see.

57:04.500 --> 57:06.208
-Right.
-A few months ago.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.625
-Actually…
-If you think about it

57:08.708 --> 57:11.416
I'd think you are elegant,

57:11.500 --> 57:14.000
and always elegant even at home.

57:14.083 --> 57:15.000
Nah.

57:15.958 --> 57:17.541
What's it to be elegant?

57:18.791 --> 57:20.666
True. Put it that way, I don't know.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.708
I'm pretty easy-going.

57:23.791 --> 57:26.125
Even when it comes to food.

57:26.208 --> 57:28.458
I would cook for hours
and eat in five minutes

57:28.541 --> 57:31.500
and wondered
why I had to spend the time cooking.

57:32.208 --> 57:35.041
But what's more important
than eating, really?

57:35.833 --> 57:39.458
-Yes.
-That's why I focus on food now.

57:39.541 --> 57:41.833
I think about lunch
as I'm eating breakfast.

57:41.916 --> 57:44.875
-That's happiness.
-It makes me happy.

57:44.958 --> 57:47.500
We should get together in Jeju.

57:47.583 --> 57:49.083
-Yes.
-We should.

58:07.083 --> 58:11.250
When's your favorite time of the day?

58:12.750 --> 58:14.083
I…

58:14.166 --> 58:16.208
Perhaps because my kids are still young.

58:16.291 --> 58:17.750
When I get back from work

58:18.541 --> 58:20.083
and see the kids.

58:20.708 --> 58:21.583
For me,

58:23.375 --> 58:25.458
the happiest time of the day…

58:25.958 --> 58:28.166
I move constantly starting in the morning.

58:28.250 --> 58:29.083
Sure.

58:29.166 --> 58:31.875
I have a daily routine.

58:31.958 --> 58:35.416
It's fun to check off my to-do list.

58:35.500 --> 58:37.916
When I'm done, and it gets dark…

58:38.000 --> 58:38.833
Yes.

58:38.916 --> 58:41.375
In the evening, I grab a drink

58:41.458 --> 58:43.625
and watch Netflix.

58:44.541 --> 58:47.583
-That's cool.
-That's my happiest moment.

58:47.666 --> 58:49.583
I get excited by myself.

58:49.666 --> 58:50.916
When that time comes?

58:51.000 --> 58:52.708
It's like a party.

58:52.791 --> 58:55.208
-My own festival.
-Alone?

58:55.291 --> 58:56.291
Alone.
