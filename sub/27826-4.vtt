WEBVTT

00:12.083 --> 00:15.709
Okay. So, before we get
to the questions,

00:15.792 --> 00:19.834
would you and the governor
like to answer
what I was saying about...

00:20.458 --> 00:22.667
I was quoting Norm Ornstein
and Thomas Mann.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.667
They're very, very esteemed
journalists.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.583
They were bipartisan.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.041
And they said it's
the Republicans' fault.

00:31.333 --> 00:35.417
I think that when
President Trump has
a good proposal,

00:35.792 --> 00:38.500
the country would be better off
if Democrats got behind it.

00:38.583 --> 00:40.208
-BILL: Like which one?
-Case in point--

00:40.291 --> 00:43.750
-(LAUGHTER)
-Case in point, how long do you
want to stay in Afghanistan?

00:43.834 --> 00:45.875
BILL: You're right.
That's the one I'm hoping for.

00:45.959 --> 00:50.542
And that-- And I know one
of the issues also is that
there is a deficit,

00:50.625 --> 00:55.375
and if you bring the troops back
from these regime-change wars,

00:55.667 --> 00:58.583
that you would save billions
of dollars and lives.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.166
-BILL: Yeah.
-And I think that's something

01:00.250 --> 01:01.458
that should have
bipartisan support.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.125
But the Republicans voted
against him on that!

01:03.208 --> 01:05.291
They finally found something
to stand up to him about,

01:05.375 --> 01:07.583
and it was, "You're not
for war enough."

01:07.667 --> 01:10.709
But, Bill, there is
an opportunity

01:10.792 --> 01:13.208
for a core of Democrats
and a core of Republicans

01:13.291 --> 01:16.792
to say, "You know what?
The president's got a good point
here, let's get behind him."

01:17.458 --> 01:20.125
Okay. Well, I'm for that.
I mean, you're right.

01:20.208 --> 01:23.417
The liberals have been
hypocritical about that.

01:23.625 --> 01:27.000
They were for ending
forever war, and now
they're for it.

01:27.083 --> 01:30.792
And when he talked about
family medical leave,
Chuck Schumer stood up,

01:30.875 --> 01:33.417
I think he was the only one
on the Democrat side who did it,
but then--

01:33.500 --> 01:35.667
You know, there, again,
reward good behavior.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.709
The first step at--

01:37.792 --> 01:42.458
To his credit, Cory Booker
brought somebody who had been
released from jail,

01:42.542 --> 01:47.333
who had been sentenced for
a long period of time,
and that...

01:47.583 --> 01:51.083
Criminal justice reform
and the FIRST STEP Act
passed in December.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.917
-BILL: Right.
-Great bipartisanship,
and it should be done again.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.667
Attacking opioids again,

01:57.333 --> 02:01.583
great national problem,
60,000 people a year
die from it,

02:01.667 --> 02:05.500
Democrats and Republicans have
a good opportunity to get behind
something like that when--

02:05.583 --> 02:08.834
And then, when he talks about
wiping out childhood leukemia,

02:08.917 --> 02:15.083
why not erupt with claps
and applause, saying,
"Hell yeah, let's do this"?

02:15.166 --> 02:16.542
Because this is
a horrible tragedy.

02:16.625 --> 02:19.000
Yeah, I don't think that
the Democrats are for
childhood leukemia.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.667
-(LAUGHTER)
-If that's what
you're implying.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.166
-I'm saying that--
-BILL: Okay. All right.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.583
-Building on the opportunity.
-So-- All right, you got
your rebuttal in.

02:24.667 --> 02:27.250
Governor Christie, do you think
there are any Democrats

02:27.333 --> 02:31.125
that have your signature
in-your-face approach
to dealing with the opposition?

02:31.208 --> 02:33.834
Is there a Democrat
Chris Christie?
I guess they're asking.

02:33.917 --> 02:35.959
-Well, thank God, no.
-(BILL LAUGHS)

02:36.041 --> 02:39.083
I-- No, listen, I think
Bernie has a bit of that.

02:39.375 --> 02:41.792
-BILL: Yeah. No, you're right.
-You know, Bernie doesn't
back down to anybody,

02:41.875 --> 02:44.250
and when Bernie's got a point
of view, he's gonna say it,

02:44.333 --> 02:46.625
and he doesn't really
sugarcoat anything,

02:46.709 --> 02:48.500
so I think Sanders is one
of those people.

02:48.583 --> 02:51.166
Who do you think is
the Democrats' best choice
to run in 2020?

02:51.250 --> 02:53.625
I think the one that
the president would be
most afraid of,

02:53.709 --> 02:56.709
if he can stay in his lane,
is Biden,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.125
and the reason why is because
Biden can go to Ohio,
and Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,

03:01.208 --> 03:04.166
and Michigan, and appeal
to white working class voters.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.750
-And if he does that...
-(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

03:06.834 --> 03:10.375
...he only has to peel off
seven to ten thousand votes

03:10.458 --> 03:12.166
in each one of those states
to be able--

03:12.250 --> 03:13.792
And he's just gotta win
two of them.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.834
But there's many states,
and he's not going to
excite the base anywhere.

03:16.917 --> 03:19.333
Yeah, but Biden-- I see, but--
Well, he's not gonna excite
the base, and--

03:19.417 --> 03:22.125
But you know what? That base
gets a little bit too excited,

03:22.375 --> 03:25.083
it's gonna drive away the rest
of the middle of the country,

03:25.166 --> 03:27.834
because some of the stuff
that the base is talking about

03:27.917 --> 03:31.208
is not gonna be appealing to
the middle of the country,

03:31.291 --> 03:33.709
and this is the same mistake
I think Democrats have made

03:33.792 --> 03:35.000
in a number
of different elections,

03:35.083 --> 03:36.792
where they say, "This is great,
we love it,"

03:36.875 --> 03:39.166
but they don't care
about what the middle
of the country thinks,

03:39.250 --> 03:40.542
they care about the two coasts.

03:40.625 --> 03:43.792
I'd also put in Tulsi Gabbard
and I'd put in John Delaney.

03:43.875 --> 03:48.041
If they get traction--
John Delaney has an incredible
business record,

03:48.125 --> 03:51.291
and Tulsi Gabbard, I think
she has a refreshing voice

03:51.375 --> 03:54.208
when it comes to these wars
that are endless
and regime change.

03:54.291 --> 03:56.834
-BILL: She's the one
the Russians like.
-CHRIS: What? (CHUCKLES)

03:56.917 --> 03:59.875
-But that investiga--
-BILL: I'm just saying,
the Russians like her.

03:59.959 --> 04:03.041
The New York Times
looked at that story
that NBC ran...

04:03.125 --> 04:05.542
-BILL: Right.
-...and discredited the guy
who claims it,

04:05.625 --> 04:08.125
this guy named Jonathan Morgan
and a group called--

04:08.208 --> 04:12.250
Okay. Eric Idle, as president
of the Footlights Club
at Cambridge,

04:12.333 --> 04:15.834
you were the first to allow
women to join. You, personally?

04:16.542 --> 04:17.917
-I did that, yes.
-BILL: You did!

04:18.000 --> 04:19.750
-Yes, I did do that.
-BILL: What motivated
your decision?

04:19.834 --> 04:20.917
-It was...
-(APPLAUSE)

04:21.000 --> 04:24.250
-BILL: What year was that?
-It was 1965.

04:24.333 --> 04:27.625
-BILL: Wow.
-And it was before the Cambridge
colleges admitted women,

04:27.709 --> 04:29.250
and it was just nuts, you know.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.875
"There's funny women!
Hell, we need them in the club,"
you know. So--

04:31.959 --> 04:34.583
-BILL: Right.
-And Germaine Greer was
the first one to join,

04:34.667 --> 04:35.750
-who wrote--
-(WOMAN CHEERS)

04:35.834 --> 04:37.166
-She wrote The Female Eunuch.
-(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

04:37.250 --> 04:38.166
-And...
-And yet--

04:38.750 --> 04:41.375
-She had more balls than any man
I ever met, actually.
-(LAUGHTER)

04:41.583 --> 04:43.917
BILL: But the Pythons mostly
dressed as women.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.542
Well, that was personal reasons.

04:45.625 --> 04:49.291
(LAUGHTER)

04:50.875 --> 04:54.417
Is it possible, someday,
we will look back on dressing
as a woman

04:54.500 --> 04:57.166
-and think that that
is not appropriate?
-NATASHA: What--

04:57.250 --> 05:01.750
I mean, we're only at
the beginning of really having
transgender awareness.

05:01.834 --> 05:02.709
Um...

05:03.458 --> 05:06.625
I wonder if someday, we'll look
back and go, "Wow, Tootsie,
not funny."

05:06.709 --> 05:08.417
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

05:08.500 --> 05:10.000
CHRIS: No, I think it'll
always be funny.

05:10.083 --> 05:11.208
(LAUGHTER)

05:11.291 --> 05:12.625
We'd have to shoot
all the comedians.

05:12.709 --> 05:15.291
Maybe if you wear a thong,
and you don't quite fit,

05:15.375 --> 05:17.000
I don't know.
That could be an angle.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.583
(INDISTINCT CHATTER
AND LAUGHTER)

05:18.667 --> 05:20.000
BILL: All right. Yeah, this--
This is--

05:20.083 --> 05:21.333
JACK: I'm trying to break
you in, Malcolm.

05:21.417 --> 05:22.792
(LAUGHTER)

05:23.208 --> 05:25.417
-BILL: Mrs. Robinson,
this is getting a little weird.
-...but I don't go that far.

05:26.208 --> 05:28.834
-Natasha, excluding Trump,
which family member...
-I've never done it.

05:28.917 --> 05:31.792
...is more likely to be
in jeopardy with
the special counsel,

05:31.875 --> 05:35.792
-Don Jr. or Jared? Oh, that's
a good question.
-Ooh. Um...

05:35.875 --> 05:41.125
I think that Don Jr. is probably
in more immediate jeopardy,
just because of his...

05:41.208 --> 05:43.291
-BILL: Really?
-...congressional testimony.
Yeah.

05:43.375 --> 05:49.083
I mean, he has been telling
his friends and associates
that he expects to be indicted,

05:49.750 --> 05:52.333
and he's been saying that
for the last couple months,

05:52.417 --> 05:59.250
so yeah, I think that
his accounts about, you know,
the Trump Tower meeting in 2016,

05:59.792 --> 06:03.417
his accounts about Trump Tower
Moscow, and how involved
he was in that,

06:03.500 --> 06:07.750
could put him in some legal
jeopardy there, and as we know,
Mueller has shown no shyness

06:07.834 --> 06:09.709
about going after people
for lying to Congress, so...

06:09.792 --> 06:13.917
Mm-hm. Okay, should any
serious discussion
of the national debt...

06:14.291 --> 06:17.959
By the way, in the State
of the Union speech,
no mention of that.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.458
Usually, presidents at least
do lip service.

06:20.667 --> 06:24.667
Trump is like, "Fuck it,
I'm just gonna write a check
the whole time I'm here.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.959
You know what? Doesn't matter.
Printing money," he said it.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.875
-I seem to have no opposition
to that.
-JACK: I don't--

06:31.959 --> 06:34.542
-(LAUGHTER)
-Should any serious discussion
of the national debt

06:34.625 --> 06:37.333
include cuts
to the military budget? Yes.

06:37.792 --> 06:39.458
-Yes.
-JACK: I think they should.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.041
Well, there you go. There's
no need to respond to that.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.792
-BILL: Well, what do you think?
-JACK: Bill, you know--

06:42.875 --> 06:44.959
The thing is, if you're gonna
really cut it, you gotta
talk about everything.

06:45.041 --> 06:46.375
-BILL: Yes.
-And the military's part of it.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.041
You gotta talk about
entitlements, though, too,

06:48.125 --> 06:50.333
which Democrats seem to be
completely allergic to.

06:50.417 --> 06:51.875
You know, they don't want
to talk about that stuff.

06:51.959 --> 06:53.208
-BILL: Well--
-They don't wanna talk about...

06:53.291 --> 06:55.333
-BILL: I agree.
-...the fact that
Medicare and Medicaid...

06:55.417 --> 06:58.750
I was a governor. I asked to do
managed care and Medicaid.

06:58.834 --> 07:00.625
Now, this is not like
splitting the atom.

07:00.709 --> 07:02.208
-There's managed care
everywhere.
-Right.

07:02.291 --> 07:06.917
It took the Obama administration
two-and-a-half years
to give me permission

07:07.000 --> 07:10.375
to spend the 50 percent
that I spend on managed care.

07:10.625 --> 07:14.291
Like, Democratic administrations
have been allergic to ever
saying to anybody,

07:14.375 --> 07:16.709
"No, you can't do that
in entitlements."

07:16.792 --> 07:20.250
So, I agree with you. I'll put
military on the table,

07:20.333 --> 07:22.458
you put entitlements
on the table, and we'll
fix the problem.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.000
-Well, that's called
a grand bargain.
-Right.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.792
And Obama tried for a grand
bargain with John Boehner,

07:26.875 --> 07:29.417
and to the point of
the editorial I just did,

07:29.500 --> 07:31.125
the Republicans wouldn't
let him.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.917
There was a-- Remember that
grand bargain?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.208
And a grand bargain is what
we need,

07:35.291 --> 07:37.542
but it has to be giving up
on both sides.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.625
Trump completely does not
understand this.

07:39.709 --> 07:44.625
His way of negotiating is,
"I want my wall. Now, how about
you give me my wall?"

07:44.959 --> 07:48.208
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

07:48.417 --> 07:50.750
-BILL: That's not a negotiation,
all right?
-CHRIS: No, and listen,

07:50.834 --> 07:53.458
I spent eight years with
Democrats in the legislature
in New Jersey,

07:53.542 --> 07:55.959
and what you learn is,
everybody has to win.

07:56.625 --> 07:59.625
-BILL: Right.
-If you're gonna negotiate,
everybody has to win something.

07:59.709 --> 08:02.792
-(APPLAUSE)
-And guys down in Washington
have forgotten about that.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.959
It's because they don't have to
work with each other,

08:05.041 --> 08:06.917
because they're in these
gerrymandered districts

08:07.000 --> 08:08.625
where they never have to worry
about a general election.

08:08.709 --> 08:10.166
All they have to worry about
is primaries.

08:10.250 --> 08:13.250
In New Jersey, I'm a Republican,
I had to worry about my back
every day.

08:13.333 --> 08:16.041
-BILL: Right.
-So make deals, and give them
some of what they want

08:16.125 --> 08:17.375
so you get some
of what you want.

08:17.750 --> 08:22.208
Just remember, he did--
In February 2018, Schumer
shut down the government.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.333
It was a three-day shutdown
over that.

08:24.417 --> 08:27.166
-(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)
-Making a deal. And now,
all he's saying is,

08:27.250 --> 08:30.083
"Why don't you vote
the way you did in February,

08:30.166 --> 08:32.458
and we don't have any glitches
in the government?"

08:32.667 --> 08:35.333
He's only talking about
5.7 billion dollars,

08:35.417 --> 08:38.166
and talking about the military?
We all know that's lunch money.

08:38.250 --> 08:42.166
-That's nothing. 5.7 billion
dollars in a...
-The military is lunch money?

08:42.250 --> 08:45.000
-...3.7-trillion-dollar
budget...
-BILL: It's a trillion dollars.

08:45.083 --> 08:48.542
-We-- When you add up--
-No, what I'm saying,
5.7 billion in comparison

08:48.625 --> 08:50.750
-to the other things
we spend on, it's nothing.
-BILL: Yes, that's right.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.583
That doesn't mean we should
waste it on something stupid.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.166
-JACK: Well--
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:54.250 --> 08:58.166
-Like border protection, Bill.
-BILL: Protection is not
necessarily a wall.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.500
-JACK: Well, no,
I have a compromise.
-BILL: Yes.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.500
-Give the Democrats 100 miles,
give the wall 100 miles.
-BILL: Jack.

09:03.583 --> 09:06.250
-Come back in two years,
see which one's more effective.
-BILL: How about--

09:06.333 --> 09:09.125
-And then build more of that
or less of it.
-How about a stealth wall?

09:09.208 --> 09:11.542
-(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)
-Because Trump thinks stealth
airplanes

09:11.625 --> 09:14.083
-are literally invisible.
-(LAUGHTER)

09:14.166 --> 09:16.500
-Thank you very much.
Sleep tight.
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

09:16.583 --> 09:18.125
All right. You're a great crowd.
