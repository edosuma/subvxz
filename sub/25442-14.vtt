♪♪

00:07.620 --> 00:09.080
This is so cool!

00:09.080 --> 00:11.830
I can't wait to finally get
my visions back from you, Nia.

00:14.250 --> 00:16.750
Uh...Nia! Hello?

00:16.750 --> 00:17.880
My visions?

00:17.880 --> 00:20.080
Oh, right, right.
Sorry.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.460
Good luck
with the procedure, Nia.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.790
Thanks, Miles.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.170
All right Nia, that's enough
smiles for Miles. Let's go.

00:26.710 --> 00:28.960
It's gonna be nice
to get you back
to being you, Booker.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.880
But I am gonna miss
your bread-making skills.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.040
Yes, and all of your new found
talents like whittling.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.040
I love my necklace.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.080
And I love my new bracelet.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.460
Don't forget
these babies.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.290
The ladies love
the man in clogs.

00:41.290 --> 00:42.460
Yeah, in Holland.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.750
Looks like I'm going
Dutch tonight.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.540
Yes, all of Booker's gifts
to us are very nice.

00:51.540 --> 00:53.830
but I think the clear winner
is my canoe.

00:56.580 --> 00:58.500
Sorry I didn't have enough time
to make the oars.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.790
Yeah, well...It's okay.

01:01.540 --> 01:03.500
So, where's Dr. Jasmine?

01:03.500 --> 01:05.040
Isn't she supposed
to do the procedure?

01:05.040 --> 01:06.120
I'm not sure where she is.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.420
She hasn't returned
my calls or texts.

01:07.420 --> 01:08.500
Well I hope she hurries up.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.040
I can't wait to get
to my Scut shift.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.880
Wow, Raven, you really seem
to love your work.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.330
Am I pulling that off? Good!
Because I hate it.

01:16.290 --> 01:17.830
But somebody's gotta
pay the bills.

01:17.830 --> 01:19.170
So can you get back
to this vision thingy?

01:19.170 --> 01:21.420
Yeah. Any way we can do this
without Jasmine?

01:21.420 --> 01:24.120
Of course. I'll just need
you both to put on your goggles.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.040
Dr. Sleevemore:
Perfect.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.540
Now, I just have to activate

01:28.540 --> 01:31.080
the Ocular Extraction
function and...

01:31.080 --> 01:33.000
(machines whirs then dies)

01:33.000 --> 01:34.750
-That's funny.
-What's funny?

01:34.750 --> 01:37.330
Well, it appears there are
no visions in Nia to extract.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.500
That's not funny.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.380
(laughs awkwardly)

01:41.120 --> 01:42.750
It's not funny at all!

01:43.460 --> 01:46.710
I mean, I know I'm laughing
but I don't know why.

01:47.670 --> 01:48.710
I don't get it.

01:48.710 --> 01:50.380
I just had my visions
last night.

01:50.380 --> 01:52.710
(laughing) Yeah,
they have to be in there.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.080
But where could they have gone?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.080
I took them!

01:55.620 --> 01:57.120
What?

01:57.120 --> 01:59.290
Jasmine, something terrible
could have happened to them.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.040
Something did. I--

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
I lost them.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.830
All:
Lost them?

02:04.830 --> 02:05.960
(Booker laughing)

02:05.960 --> 02:08.170
She lost them!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.290
Gone! Poof!

02:12.330 --> 02:13.420
(laughter turns to crying)

02:13.420 --> 02:17.080

(laughing)

03:08.460 --> 03:10.620
Jasmine, how could you?
I'm shocked.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.120
I'm not. I'm not shocked.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.540
You know why?

03:13.540 --> 03:15.040
'Cause I knew she was gonna
steal my baby's visions.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.330
-For that, I'm taking the canoe.
-Now let's not be so hasty.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.670
Thanks a lot, Jasmine.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.380
I'm sorry everyone.

03:23.380 --> 03:24.960
I didn't take the visions
for myself.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.330
I only took them to prove
my theory about VNA.

03:27.330 --> 03:28.920
-VN--what?
-What's that?

03:28.920 --> 03:31.620
Much like how DNA is the genetic
makeup for normal humans,

03:31.620 --> 03:33.330
I believe VNA is
the genetic makeup

03:33.330 --> 03:35.120
for psychics
who get visions.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.330
And while Booker
may get visions and Nia doesn't,

03:37.330 --> 03:39.540
my theory is that
they still share the same VNA.

03:40.380 --> 03:41.500
Does anyone here speak nerd?

03:43.670 --> 03:44.790
I speak a little.

03:46.330 --> 03:49.000
She's saying the only reason
Booker's visions

03:49.000 --> 03:52.170
transferred into Nia
is because they're family.

03:52.170 --> 03:53.380
Precisely.

03:53.380 --> 03:54.380
And to prove this,

03:54.380 --> 03:56.040
I was gonna put Booker's visions
into myself.

03:56.460 --> 03:58.960
If my brain rejected them,
my theory would be proven.

03:59.580 --> 04:00.380
Brilliant.

04:01.380 --> 04:02.500
Isn't she brilliant?

04:03.920 --> 04:05.120
That's one word for her.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.330
How did you lose them?

04:08.330 --> 04:09.210
It happened last night.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.420
After I extracted
the visions from Nia.

04:13.790 --> 04:15.420
The visions are finally mine...

04:16.420 --> 04:19.460
to experiment with before
I put them back into Booker.

04:27.420 --> 04:28.290
It's so cold.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.790
Boy:
Who are you?

04:43.460 --> 04:44.580
When I realized
I lost the goggles,

04:44.580 --> 04:46.120
I retraced my steps
this morning.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.540
But I think that kid in the
hallway must have found them.

04:48.540 --> 04:49.580
Who is this kid?

04:49.580 --> 04:50.750
I don't know.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.000
But when he asked
what I was doing in there,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.210
I told him I was having
a sleepover with Nia

04:54.210 --> 04:55.080
but got homesick.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.080
And then he said,

04:56.080 --> 04:58.830
"Homesick? Loser!"

04:59.790 --> 05:00.580
All:
Mitch!

05:01.460 --> 05:02.830
Oh no.

05:02.830 --> 05:06.040
If Mitch has the goggles,
that means he has my visions.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.170
Not if he hasn't put them on.

05:07.170 --> 05:10.080
And even if he has,
if Mitch doesn't have VNA,

05:10.080 --> 05:11.750
Booker's visions won't stick
anyway, right?

05:11.750 --> 05:13.710
VNA is just my theory.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.420
If Mitch puts on the goggles,

05:15.420 --> 05:16.580
there's no telling
what will happen.

05:16.580 --> 05:19.420
Well, I gotta leave right now
and get those goggles back!

05:20.330 --> 05:21.620
Without my visions,
I'm nothing.

05:21.620 --> 05:22.790
(sighs)

05:22.790 --> 05:24.040
I feel like this is my fault.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.250
That's because it is.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.500
It's not all her fault.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.880
If I had told Booker that I had
his visions right away,

05:30.880 --> 05:32.290
none of this
would have happened.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.710
Well, I really
want to help fix it.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.620
-Me too.
-Fine. Let's just go.

05:37.620 --> 05:38.920
Wait, I can take you guys.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.420
Don't worry about it, Mom,
you have to work.

05:41.420 --> 05:43.420
Yeah, we got this.
And we're better
at dealing with Mitch.

05:43.420 --> 05:44.710
Okay, but it's gonna rain.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.170
Uh, we'll take the canoe.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.420
The canoe?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.330
Doesn't even have oars.

05:56.210 --> 05:57.080
Raven?

05:57.620 --> 05:58.540
What's wrong?

06:00.040 --> 06:03.000
Just hearing Booker say that
he's nothing without his visions

06:03.000 --> 06:04.120
kind of hearts my heart.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.120
And what are the chances
that he's actually gonna

06:06.120 --> 06:07.460
get them back from Mitch?

06:07.880 --> 06:09.540
I just wish there was something

06:09.540 --> 06:11.580
that I can do
to make this better.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.460
I feel like I let him down.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.330
Raven, you can't
blame yourself for this.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.580
At this point, we've done
everything we can.

06:18.580 --> 06:19.790
Maybe not.

06:21.580 --> 06:23.500
Maybe there's another way
I can help him.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.330
What do you suggest?

06:27.670 --> 06:29.120
Dr. Sleevemore, I--

06:30.120 --> 06:32.040
I want you to take
my visions out of me

06:33.540 --> 06:34.670
and I want you
to put them in Booker.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.620
These clogs are not good
for running!

06:48.170 --> 06:49.620
What do you want?

06:49.620 --> 06:51.250
Ha ha! What up Mitch?

06:51.670 --> 06:52.880
So um...

06:52.880 --> 06:54.670
I was just wondering
if you happen to see

06:54.670 --> 06:56.080
a pair of cool sunglasses?

06:56.080 --> 06:58.880
I didn't find
any cool sunglasses.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.040
But...

07:00.040 --> 07:02.170
I did find these.

07:02.170 --> 07:04.250
I was gonna put them
in the Lost and Found.

07:04.710 --> 07:07.380
And by Lost and Found
I mean the garbage.

07:07.380 --> 07:08.540
Ha ha!

07:10.000 --> 07:12.290
Well, you haven't put
them on yet, have you?

07:12.290 --> 07:14.580
Why would I put
these lame things on?

07:14.580 --> 07:15.580
Okay--

07:15.580 --> 07:19.460
Der! Look at me
in my new glasses.

07:19.460 --> 07:22.670
Der! They help me see
things really clearly.

07:22.670 --> 07:25.460
Like...Losers!

07:25.750 --> 07:26.580
Ha!

07:26.920 --> 07:28.250
Here, take them.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.750
Save me a trip
to the garbage. Ha!

07:31.620 --> 07:33.710
Nice clogs, losers!

07:43.750 --> 07:45.750
You just saw the uh--?
In his--

07:45.750 --> 07:46.920
I--I saw.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.290
He had my--
(cries).

07:53.290 --> 07:55.000
That sounded like a yes.

08:02.330 --> 08:06.420
Mitch. My visions!
They're in him.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.580
They're gone!

08:08.880 --> 08:10.790
Don't worry, Booker.
If my theory is correct,

08:10.790 --> 08:12.460
Mitch's body will
reject the visions.

08:12.460 --> 08:14.120
And if your theory is wrong?

08:14.670 --> 08:16.710
Then Booker's visions
stay in Mitch forever.

08:16.710 --> 08:18.000
(body collapses)

08:19.710 --> 08:20.540
He's down again.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.290
If you could extract them
from me,

08:24.290 --> 08:25.790
we can extract them from Mitch.

08:25.790 --> 08:28.120
So we just need to find a way
to get the goggles back on him.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.250
Yeah, I'm sure we can do that.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.880
Good. 'Cause I need
my visions back.

08:32.620 --> 08:34.750
I can't just be plain, old,
ordinary Booker

08:34.750 --> 08:35.880
for the rest of my life.

08:41.830 --> 08:44.120
Wooh! Let's go.

08:46.210 --> 08:48.210
Yeah, that's ordinary.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.500
Come on, Doc. Hook me up.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.710
Being a good mom
is everything to me.

08:57.710 --> 09:00.250
And if I can give Booker
my visions to make him happy,

09:00.250 --> 09:01.290
then I'm gonna do it.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.790
Raven, I'm not even sure
that we can successfully

09:04.790 --> 09:06.460
transfer your visions to Booker.

09:06.460 --> 09:09.750
I mean, Jasmine's theory, it's--
It's just a theory!

09:09.750 --> 09:11.670
I have to do something, Doc.

09:11.670 --> 09:14.460
Look, it's clear you want to be
a good mom.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.670
What if I told you
there might be a different way

09:16.670 --> 09:18.000
for you to help Booker?

09:19.670 --> 09:21.330
Are you gonna clone me?

09:22.750 --> 09:25.710
Because cloned Raven
can take care of the kids

09:25.710 --> 09:27.000
and drive the Scut.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.960
While the real Raven
goes to Jamaica.

09:30.460 --> 09:32.790
No, I had a slightly different
plan in mind.

09:32.790 --> 09:35.000
-Oh, and then Jamaica?
-No, no Jamaica!

09:36.880 --> 09:39.880
Look, you might not be able
to give Booker your visions

09:39.880 --> 09:43.290
but you can help him
with his vision.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.790
Yeah, I know you're trying
to make the distinction

09:46.790 --> 09:48.750
between like,
visions and vision

09:48.750 --> 09:49.830
but I'm not getting it.

09:51.170 --> 09:53.170
Perhaps it'll be easier
for me to show you.

09:53.170 --> 09:54.040
Okay.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.420
Here.

09:58.750 --> 09:59.750
(goggles whir)

10:04.670 --> 10:06.540
This Scut car looks familiar.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.790
It should, mama.
It's yours.

10:08.790 --> 10:10.670
(gasps) Booker?

10:10.670 --> 10:12.040
You're a Scut driver now?

10:12.040 --> 10:13.750
Yep, have been for years.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.920
Oh! And you like it?

10:15.920 --> 10:19.210
Like it? I hate it.

10:20.710 --> 10:22.750
But, it's like you always said,

10:22.750 --> 10:24.500
"Someone's gotta pay the bills."

10:24.500 --> 10:26.040
But you know all this.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.670
I do?
How?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.330
-Because I still
live with you.
-Huh?

10:32.540 --> 10:34.750
Ah! My thirty-year-old son
still lives with me?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.540
-What?
-It's all right!

10:36.540 --> 10:37.540
It's all right.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.420
No, no it is not all right, Doc.

10:40.420 --> 10:42.500
That was the worst vision
I've ever had.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.040
No, no, no. That's because
it wasn't a vision.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.540
Yes, it was, Doc. I was old.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.710
I was old, Doc.
It was the future!

10:47.710 --> 10:49.170
No, no, no.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.380
This function simply taps
into your deepest emotions.

10:51.380 --> 10:56.080
Your desires, your fears,
what you saw wasn't the future.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.210
You simply saw the thing
that you're most afraid of.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.880
Oh, you're right. You're right.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.420
Seeing either of my kids
unhappy is my worst fear.

11:05.380 --> 11:06.330
I mean, that and--

11:07.830 --> 11:09.170
You know, a spider crawling up
your nose while you sleep.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.420
Ew...

11:10.420 --> 11:12.790
Oh, it happens. It's called
arach-nose-phobia.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.960
Listen, I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.040
Honestly, Booker
has such big dreams

11:19.040 --> 11:21.000
and I would never want him
to give up on any of them.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.420
But, isn't that what you did?

11:25.750 --> 11:28.540
I seem to recall you had some
pretty big dreams of your own.

11:30.620 --> 11:31.830
I did, didn't I?

11:34.080 --> 11:37.960
Look, maybe your biggest fear

11:37.960 --> 11:40.040
isn't that Booker's still living
with you when he's 30.

11:40.620 --> 11:44.210
Maybe your biggest fear
is that he follows your example

11:44.210 --> 11:46.620
and doesn't pursue his dreams.

11:48.830 --> 11:50.880
The still living with me
when he's thirty

11:50.880 --> 11:52.290
is pretty big though, Doc.

11:52.290 --> 11:54.960
It's pretty big.
No, I get it. I get it.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.380
Yeah, you right. You right.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.000
All right, remember:

12:04.000 --> 12:05.960
We're just gonna invite Mitch
to play laser tag with us

12:05.960 --> 12:07.790
so we can get the goggles
back on him.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.290
Well, let's do this.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.580
Get ready for a welcoming,
(mocking) "What do you want?"

12:15.790 --> 12:17.580
Good day, neighbors.

12:18.830 --> 12:20.710
To what do I owe this pleasure?

12:21.580 --> 12:22.580
Mitch?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.120
That's you?

12:25.250 --> 12:28.120
Of course it's me,
you silly billy.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.290
(chuckles)

12:29.290 --> 12:30.920
I'm not lucky enough
to have a twin like you.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.420
Lucky!

12:32.420 --> 12:33.790
Lucky her!

12:35.380 --> 12:37.540
What is happening?

12:37.540 --> 12:39.960
Anyway, we were
just gonna go to the roof

12:39.960 --> 12:41.750
to play some laser tag.
Do you want to come with us?

12:41.750 --> 12:44.540
Yeah, we even brought an extra
pair of goggles for you.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.830
Laser tag, huh?

12:46.830 --> 12:48.040
And we know
you're gonna call it

12:48.040 --> 12:49.080
(mocking)
"Loser tag."

12:49.080 --> 12:50.830
But we promise, it'll be fun.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.170
Sorry, I can't.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.250
I've given up games
that have winners and losers.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.580
(gasps)
I'm not even comfortable
saying the "L" word anymore.

13:01.830 --> 13:04.040
In my book,
we're all winners.

13:05.460 --> 13:08.500
Have fun!
TTFN, winners!

13:11.620 --> 13:13.710
Seriously, what just happened?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.920
Since Mitch doesn't have VNA,

13:15.920 --> 13:18.040
Booker's vision power must be
distorting his perception

13:18.040 --> 13:19.250
of how he sees himself.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.540
Distortion?

13:20.540 --> 13:22.540
More like warped beyond belief.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.620
I've got an idea.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.750
Now that you've seen
the future you fear the most,

13:33.120 --> 13:36.000
it's time for you to see
the future you desire the most.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.540
Now we're talking, Doc!

13:39.380 --> 13:41.420
(goggles whir)

13:41.420 --> 13:43.750
(upbeat dance music playing)

13:46.040 --> 13:47.540
(clapping)

14:07.040 --> 14:11.620
(clapping and cheering)

14:11.620 --> 14:13.290
Thank you for coming out
to help me launch

14:13.290 --> 14:15.460
my new fashion line,
Raven-ous.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.120
Because when fashion
is this tasty,

14:17.120 --> 14:18.290
people get ravenous.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.460
We are so proud of you
for following your dreams, mom.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.330
You're really an inspiration.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.290
How was that?

14:35.540 --> 14:36.880
That was fantastic.

14:37.580 --> 14:38.960
I was a fashion designer,

14:38.960 --> 14:41.040
my kids were proud of me.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.420
So, Doc, which outcome
do you think's gonna come true?

14:45.420 --> 14:46.960
My desires or my fears?

14:46.960 --> 14:48.120
I'm sorry, Raven.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.330
There's no machine that
can give you that answer.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.040
I got it.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.290
But you can, right?

14:55.670 --> 14:57.290
I think you know the answer.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.830
Yeah, right, right.

14:58.830 --> 14:59.830
(clears throat)

15:01.380 --> 15:02.380
Can I get a hint?

15:08.210 --> 15:10.620
Okay, let's go over
the script again.

15:10.620 --> 15:11.960
-Booker.
-(clears throat)

15:13.580 --> 15:18.080
"Hey, Mitch. You're a nice guy.
And nice guys love picnics."

15:20.210 --> 15:24.210
"How about joining us for a
no-conflict picnic on the roof?"

15:26.040 --> 15:27.380
"Now that the rain has cleared,

15:27.380 --> 15:29.170
you'll be sure to need
these sunglasses."

15:30.580 --> 15:31.830
Okay, let's hope
you all do better

15:31.830 --> 15:32.880
when he opens the door.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.250
Maybe it's the script you wrote.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.250
It's never the script.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.250
What?

15:40.250 --> 15:42.250
(scoffs) (in British accent)
More fans!

15:42.250 --> 15:43.790
You bore me.

15:43.790 --> 15:47.040
(laughs)
Do finger sandwiches
sound boring?

15:47.040 --> 15:50.000
I will spit on your
finger sandwiches right now!

15:51.250 --> 15:53.460
Rockers don't picnic.

15:53.460 --> 15:54.880
They rock!

15:58.120 --> 15:59.380
(rock music blaring)

16:00.040 --> 16:01.420
The vision energy
must have changed

16:01.420 --> 16:03.080
the way he sees himself again.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.080
Thanks, Dr. Obvious.

16:07.670 --> 16:09.750
Okay, let's go through
the new script again.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.170
I say, "What an awesome day
to rock out."

16:12.170 --> 16:14.380
-And then Booker you say--
-I'm just doing this.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.580
That's not what you say.

16:20.540 --> 16:23.120
I don't have time for whatever
it is you're peddling.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.880
I need to find a way
to cross the Delaware.

16:28.580 --> 16:31.040
What the founding father
is he doing?

16:31.670 --> 16:35.580
First he was nice, now he's
the father of our country?

16:35.580 --> 16:37.170
He clearly thinks
very highly of himself.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.080
I got an idea.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.420
General Washington,

16:42.290 --> 16:44.330
we may be able
to help you cross the Delaware.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.750
General's listening.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.420
This boat is perfect
to cross the Delaware.

16:55.380 --> 16:56.290
Go, go.

16:56.290 --> 17:00.250
"No, it's not.
It doesn't have oars."

17:00.250 --> 17:03.750
"Then how will we ever
row without oars?"

17:05.120 --> 17:07.580
"Good thing I have
my trusty whittling kit."

17:08.250 --> 17:10.710
"Trusty"?
Who said he could ad-lib?

17:11.500 --> 17:14.170
"I'll just whittle you
some oars."

17:18.540 --> 17:20.500
But before he does,

17:20.500 --> 17:22.120
you might want to wear
these goggles

17:22.120 --> 17:23.750
to protect your eyes
from wood chips.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.380
Fie on your goggles.

17:25.380 --> 17:27.830
A little wood
can't take me down.

17:31.330 --> 17:33.210
Hey guys, what's happening
to his eyes?

17:33.210 --> 17:35.210
I think his body's about
to reject the visions.

17:35.210 --> 17:36.620
Hurry, Nia! Put the goggles
on him before--

17:40.960 --> 17:42.830
My theory was right!

17:42.830 --> 17:45.330
And now the visions
are gonna go look for someone
with the right VNA.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.540
Oh! Me! Me!
I have the right VNA!

17:50.380 --> 17:52.330
Oh no! My visions!

17:55.380 --> 17:57.620
I probably should've told them
to take their goggles off.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.380
Where did my visions go?

18:06.790 --> 18:09.250
Hey, why am I in a canoe?

18:12.380 --> 18:15.080
And why am I in
my George Washington outfit?

18:16.210 --> 18:19.290
Dude, the real question is,

18:19.290 --> 18:21.960
why do you have
a George Washington outfit?

18:23.290 --> 18:24.790
You don't know my life!

18:24.790 --> 18:26.920
Unpatriotic losers!

18:29.620 --> 18:33.420
Well, the good news is
he doesn't remember a thing.

18:33.420 --> 18:36.790
Bad news is, he's back
to being his old self.

18:36.790 --> 18:38.080
I wish I were.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.960
Booker! Good news!

18:45.420 --> 18:46.960
Did you find my visions?

18:46.960 --> 18:50.080
No, but the yogurt shop
is having a BOGO on fro-yo.

18:53.580 --> 18:56.210
Uh, kids.
What are you looking for?

18:56.210 --> 18:57.790
We're looking for my visions.

18:57.790 --> 19:01.040
They flew off the roof
and now they're gone forever.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.460
I'm nothing without them.

19:04.380 --> 19:05.540
Booker, that's the second time

19:05.540 --> 19:07.290
I've heard you say that
you're nothing today.

19:07.290 --> 19:08.500
And I don't like it.
Sit down.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.420
-Do I have to stay for this?
-Yes! You do, Nia.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.290
Sit down.
I'm talking to you too.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.960
Get your little tushie
in the seat.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.330
Okay, while you kids
were on a vision quest,

19:22.330 --> 19:24.960
I was kinda on one of my own.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.420
And, I realized that
somewhere along the way,

19:28.420 --> 19:29.620
I lost my vision.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.540
You lost your visions?

19:32.040 --> 19:35.120
No, I lost my vision
of what I want my life to be.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.170
I want to be a fashion designer.

19:37.170 --> 19:38.620
And Dr. Sleevemore
helped me realize

19:38.620 --> 19:40.460
that if I don't go
after my dreams,

19:40.460 --> 19:42.420
then I'm not setting
a good example for you kids.

19:42.420 --> 19:43.540
And he was right.

19:44.290 --> 19:46.170
That--That's great and all, mom.

19:46.170 --> 19:49.290
But, what does it have to do
with me losing my visions?

19:49.960 --> 19:51.420
Booker...

19:51.960 --> 19:53.420
you might not be
the Booker you were

19:53.420 --> 19:54.750
when you had visions.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.250
But that doesn't mean you can't
be the best Booker you can be.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.040
Visions don't define
who you are.

20:02.290 --> 20:03.580
You're right, Mom.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.040
Thank you.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.380
And I'm gonna lead by example.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.170
-Yes? Right?
-Yeah.

20:09.170 --> 20:11.040
I am gonna be the best me
that I can be.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.460
And I'm gonna put my money
where my dream is.

20:13.460 --> 20:14.830
You remember that $10,000?

20:14.830 --> 20:16.670
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I know exactly
how I'm gonna spend it.

20:16.670 --> 20:18.670
-Oh, Jamaica?
-Ohh!

20:20.330 --> 20:23.790
No, I just-- I just--
My dream!

20:23.790 --> 20:25.000
Oh, oh, oh.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.790
-And then we going--
-Both: To Jamaica!

20:28.790 --> 20:30.500
Well, not "we." Just me.

20:37.620 --> 20:38.710
Poor baby.

20:39.330 --> 20:40.750
Still looking for his visions?

20:40.750 --> 20:43.040
No, he has
his spyglass backwards.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.540
It's been really nice
reconnecting with you, Raven.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.920
Yeah, it really has,
Dr. Sleevemore.
And you know what?

20:50.920 --> 20:52.880
Thank you for treating us all
to deep dish.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.580
Oh, it's the least I can do

20:54.580 --> 20:56.580
for my granddaughter
losing your son's visions.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.540
Plus, you told me on the phone
it was the least I could do

20:59.540 --> 21:01.920
for my granddaughter
losing your son's visions.

21:04.290 --> 21:06.330
Do you think my visions
are out there looking for me

21:06.330 --> 21:07.460
the way I'm looking for them?

21:07.460 --> 21:08.580
Sure!

21:13.380 --> 21:15.460
Who would have thought we'd meet
over my frozen brother?

21:15.460 --> 21:17.670
Yeah. But I'm
really glad we did.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.460
Too close.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.330
You can get close
to that pizza over there,

21:22.330 --> 21:23.710
that's what you can
get close to.

21:26.460 --> 21:29.120
Come on, Nia. Let's go be
with your bother, he needs us.

21:30.380 --> 21:32.460
Booker, I know you feel alone.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.000
But you don't have to,
all right?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.080
We're in this together.
We're family.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.500
Thanks, Mom.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.880
(electricity whirs)

21:42.170 --> 21:43.460
Does anybody else
feel something?

21:47.170 --> 21:48.000
Look!

21:48.000 --> 21:49.170
(thunder roars)

21:51.460 --> 21:53.920
Our combined VNA
is attracting the vision power.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.330
My theory is proven!

21:56.710 --> 21:58.330
Hold tighter,
hold tighter!

21:58.330 --> 21:59.500
-Hold tighter!
-Okay!

22:07.620 --> 22:10.460
I'm back.
I'm back!

22:10.460 --> 22:11.790
(laughing happily)

22:11.790 --> 22:13.080
Not that I needed it though.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.620
-But I'm back!
-Whoo!

22:15.620 --> 22:17.420
He's back! My baby's back!

22:17.420 --> 22:19.920
(all cheering happily)
