WEBVTT

01:03.805 --> 01:05.807
I don't know where we are.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.743
Yeah. Me neither.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.545
There's no turning back.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.348
We're lost forever!

01:12.747 --> 01:14.283
Just the two of us.

01:14.383 --> 01:15.383
Yeah...

01:15.684 --> 01:18.187
Everybody else in the world
can go fuck themselves.

01:23.558 --> 01:25.627
I love your skin, Amber.

01:26.195 --> 01:27.430
That's sweet.

01:27.562 --> 01:30.665
I love your hair,
your neck, your...

01:30.865 --> 01:32.134
Clavicle.

01:33.135 --> 01:37.173
What about something
about my personality?

01:37.806 --> 01:38.806
Oh...

01:38.873 --> 01:41.710
I really love your imagination.

01:42.610 --> 01:44.813
Really? Aw.

02:39.135 --> 02:40.269
Wow...

02:40.403 --> 02:41.669
Cool.

02:50.980 --> 02:53.449
I hope this won't
give me a rash.

02:53.581 --> 02:54.816
Nah, I'm sure it's fine, babe.

02:54.950 --> 02:57.219
Nothing natural
can hurt us too bad.

02:57.652 --> 02:58.820
That's bullshit.

02:58.954 --> 03:00.822
Natural stuff fucking kills you.

03:00.956 --> 03:02.690
What about poison plants,
and wolves?

03:02.892 --> 03:06.328
Oh, babe, I had
the coolest dream last night!

03:10.066 --> 03:14.470
<i>We were in Washington D.C.,
like thousands of people.</i>

03:15.004 --> 03:17.373
<i>We were storming the capitol.</i>

03:17.705 --> 03:19.641
<i>The pigs were there guarding it,</i>

03:19.741 --> 03:21.743
<i>but we broke through.</i>

03:22.211 --> 03:27.283
<i>And then we started
a whole new perfect society,</i>

03:27.450 --> 03:29.751
<i>where everyone was equal.</i>

03:31.686 --> 03:33.889
It was a sweet trip.

03:35.291 --> 03:38.994
I'm less worried about the pigs
than I am about the wolves.

03:39.228 --> 03:43.199
Any animals out here are
gonna be way more scared of us

03:43.299 --> 03:44.433
than we are of them...

03:44.533 --> 03:46.102
Animals should be
afraid of humans.

03:46.235 --> 03:47.635
We hunt for sport.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.905
And we're burning down
their forests in Vietnam.

03:50.139 --> 03:52.208
The bambis
can't defend themselves.

03:52.374 --> 03:53.509
But wolves...

03:53.641 --> 03:55.377
Wolves know the deal.

03:56.011 --> 03:59.248
They know they're faster
and fiercer than us.

03:59.381 --> 04:00.381
No...

04:00.715 --> 04:04.587
They think we're like
confusing weird other things.

04:04.819 --> 04:07.523
We're blobs of meat to them.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.092
They just stay away from us.

04:10.593 --> 04:11.961
Or chomp on us...

04:14.662 --> 04:16.999
Jesus, Amber, whoa, whoa...

04:17.133 --> 04:17.967
Whoa.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.036
You turned into a demon there
in my mind.

04:24.739 --> 04:26.175
I think...

04:26.674 --> 04:28.511
We should get a dog.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.080
Really?

04:31.413 --> 04:32.814
Aw...

04:33.549 --> 04:35.351
Oh, shit. Shit.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.484
Shit.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.293
We need twigs.

04:47.897 --> 04:49.365
I'll get some.

04:51.567 --> 04:54.403
I always dug
the name great Dane.

04:54.970 --> 04:58.107
I want a white one,
with big black spots.

05:00.109 --> 05:02.077
That's cool.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.185
Whoa!

05:09.351 --> 05:10.685
Look!

05:11.153 --> 05:12.388
What's up?

05:14.590 --> 05:15.790
Oh...

05:16.358 --> 05:17.560
Far out.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.963
It's probably some kind
of military base.

05:23.132 --> 05:24.366
Could be...

05:27.869 --> 05:29.305
It keeps going.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.741
Kill it.

05:34.276 --> 05:35.444
Ugh!

05:35.578 --> 05:37.580
Uh, what are you doing?

05:39.081 --> 05:40.081
Matt!

05:42.051 --> 05:45.187
I can see your balls
dangling as you climb.

05:45.588 --> 05:46.721
That's nice.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.626
Fuck, this thing is high!

05:50.758 --> 05:52.860
Oh, Jesus, Matt.

05:53.529 --> 05:55.064
Amber, there's a castle!

05:55.197 --> 05:56.999
It's like the home
of Walt Disney.

05:58.667 --> 06:01.237
He's gonna shoot you
for trespassing!

06:01.370 --> 06:03.939
I'm clearly unarmed.

06:05.674 --> 06:07.176
I'm coming!

06:10.179 --> 06:12.847
What if it's a secret
weapons lab or test site?

06:12.982 --> 06:15.050
There could be chemicals
all over these trees!

06:15.217 --> 06:17.486
C'mon, babe, have some faith.

06:17.686 --> 06:20.889
There could be magic here.
Or a utopia...

06:21.056 --> 06:23.192
Use your imagination.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.566
Utopias never work out.

06:40.808 --> 06:42.478
Holy shit...

06:43.012 --> 06:45.581
What?

06:45.914 --> 06:47.249
- What is it?
- Shh.

06:47.383 --> 06:48.383
Quiet.

07:04.266 --> 07:05.800
No way.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.004
There is magic here.

07:11.173 --> 07:12.308
Whoa.

07:14.443 --> 07:15.477
Wow!

07:16.045 --> 07:17.913
You're pretty.

07:19.715 --> 07:20.716
Hey, there.

07:20.848 --> 07:22.351
Hey, girl...

07:23.018 --> 07:25.287
Matt, don't mess with it.

07:26.322 --> 07:27.956
It's gentle.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.795
Leave it alone, Matt.

07:32.928 --> 07:34.663
You're wigging it out.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.864
I just want to pet her.

07:40.235 --> 07:41.337
C'mon...

07:43.939 --> 07:46.608
Okay, beautiful, we'll leave.

07:47.309 --> 07:50.579
Bye-bye, pretty girl.

07:54.817 --> 07:56.485
Whoa, oh!

07:56.618 --> 07:58.387
Argh!

08:02.958 --> 08:04.827
No!

08:12.901 --> 08:14.937
Oh! Matt!

08:16.672 --> 08:19.475
Please be okay, Matt!

08:19.575 --> 08:21.043
No! No!

08:21.176 --> 08:23.112
Matt!

08:23.278 --> 08:25.914
Matt... you're gonna be okay.

08:26.115 --> 08:28.384
You're gonna be okay, Matt.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.353
I love you.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.893
Matt, please come back!

08:38.026 --> 08:40.062
Please come back, Matt...

08:41.930 --> 08:44.166
No!

08:48.670 --> 08:50.939
I love you too.

09:39.822 --> 09:41.891
Argh! Ah!

09:52.902 --> 09:54.636
You...

10:03.011 --> 10:04.680
I'm sorry.

10:49.091 --> 10:50.592
Oh, fuck...

10:52.761 --> 10:54.229
Hello!

10:58.267 --> 10:59.434
Fuck!

11:16.852 --> 11:18.453
Helicopters!

11:19.755 --> 11:21.423
Is anyone there?

11:24.526 --> 11:26.261
I need help!

11:29.565 --> 11:31.166
Hello!

11:41.777 --> 11:43.612
Anybody here?

11:54.690 --> 11:56.224
"Cryptids?"

11:59.261 --> 12:00.662
What is this place?

13:50.940 --> 13:53.375
<i>I grew up an army brat...</i>

13:55.111 --> 14:00.348
<i>Mostly at a base in okinawa,
just after world war ii ended.</i>

14:09.558 --> 14:15.263
<i>When I was a little girl, I had
the most horrible nightmares.</i>

14:46.996 --> 14:48.396
<i>Until...</i>

14:49.065 --> 14:50.599
<i>The Baku came.</i>

15:02.044 --> 15:05.347
<i>The Baku ate my nightmares,</i>

15:06.381 --> 15:08.617
<i>allowing me to sleep.</i>

15:20.930 --> 15:22.531
<i>Nobody at the camp believed me</i>

15:22.597 --> 15:24.967
<i>when I told them about the Baku.</i>

15:25.834 --> 15:27.536
<i>I never forgot her.</i>

15:31.873 --> 15:34.243
<i>When I grew up,
I dedicated my life</i>

15:35.044 --> 15:38.380
<i>to keeping cryptids like her
safe from harm.</i>

15:41.884 --> 15:43.485
Huh!

15:43.785 --> 15:44.820
Ah!

15:57.033 --> 15:58.333
Good boy!

16:13.082 --> 16:16.484
<i>Across the globe, cryptids
are captured and traded</i>

16:16.585 --> 16:17.954
<i>on black markets.</i>

16:18.854 --> 16:23.758
<i>It's my duty to be their
human rescuer and protector.</i>

17:26.188 --> 17:30.092
Ah, my old friend, Lauren grey.

17:30.927 --> 17:32.427
Come to join the party?

17:32.527 --> 17:33.527
You wish.

17:33.795 --> 17:36.265
- Do you recognize this?
- Ooh...

17:36.498 --> 17:37.499
For tickling?

17:37.766 --> 17:39.734
Oh, you're so kinky, Lauren.

17:39.936 --> 17:42.071
Look, don't play
dumb with me, Gustav.

17:42.338 --> 17:45.408
I found this alkonost feather
at an auction in Morocco.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.841
You're trading these?

17:46.976 --> 17:50.012
Well, I'm a cryptid myself.

17:50.179 --> 17:54.016
Now why would I get involved
in the black market?

17:54.183 --> 17:54.984
For the money.

17:55.151 --> 17:57.485
How else do you pay
for all your whoring?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.022
You owe me, Gustav.

18:01.690 --> 18:05.094
Well, I... I'll make
a call, okay? Um.

18:05.394 --> 18:07.529
I can get you the bird lady.

18:10.933 --> 18:12.834
I didn't free you
from a cryptid prison,

18:12.969 --> 18:15.137
so you could traffic
cryptids yourself.

18:15.770 --> 18:16.538
You...

18:16.671 --> 18:18.207
You should be ashamed.

18:18.441 --> 18:22.178
Oh, come on, Lauren.
Can you take a lesson from me?

18:22.311 --> 18:24.713
Loosen the fuck up, please!

18:24.880 --> 18:27.816
Besides, I'm just the middleman.

18:30.652 --> 18:31.820
Who are they?

18:32.021 --> 18:33.788
The babushkas.

18:34.290 --> 18:36.325
They sold me the feathers.

18:36.858 --> 18:39.328
They are the keepers
of the bird.

18:39.594 --> 18:42.064
But not for long.

18:47.236 --> 18:48.236
Hey!

18:48.270 --> 18:49.270
What's he doing?

18:49.372 --> 18:50.373
Don't worry.

18:50.605 --> 18:53.142
He and I,
we have an arrangement.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.879
Thanks for the muscle, droog.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.615
Very classy, Gustav.

19:21.770 --> 19:25.740
The babushkas are
quite protective of the bird.

19:26.275 --> 19:27.642
As they should be.

19:27.776 --> 19:29.512
According to Russian folklore,

19:29.677 --> 19:33.215
when her eggs hatch,
it causes terrible storms.

19:37.386 --> 19:38.620
Oh...

19:39.388 --> 19:40.990
Look what they've done!

19:42.624 --> 19:45.327
I had no idea, I swear.

19:46.062 --> 19:48.364
Here you go, my dear.

19:48.497 --> 19:50.032
Here you go.

19:52.535 --> 19:53.868
There you are.

19:54.003 --> 19:56.238
Let's get you out of here.

20:01.377 --> 20:02.811
Oh, man!

20:03.245 --> 20:04.679
Poor girl.

20:06.315 --> 20:07.216
Hey...

20:07.316 --> 20:08.384
Hey, girl.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.885
What's your name?

20:10.019 --> 20:12.421
You look like a Sasha to me.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.924
Do you like that? Sasha?

20:15.057 --> 20:16.892
Okay, good. Sasha.

20:17.026 --> 20:18.461
I'm gonna get you
some place safe.

20:20.496 --> 20:22.264
God damn it!

20:23.665 --> 20:24.900
Ahh!

20:25.101 --> 20:26.102
Ah!

20:26.202 --> 20:27.436
<i>Stupid babushka.</i>

20:47.923 --> 20:51.060
Hey, grey, come on, let's split!

20:52.194 --> 20:53.661
Come on!

21:09.311 --> 21:10.379
Hey!

21:11.080 --> 21:12.882
Wait! Ah...

21:18.420 --> 21:19.420
Ahh...

21:19.889 --> 21:21.090
No!

21:22.124 --> 21:23.893
You're hurting her!

21:24.193 --> 21:25.261
No!

21:29.365 --> 21:30.865
Hey, hey!

21:31.200 --> 21:32.902
Look who it is!

21:35.770 --> 21:37.907
The alkonost is mine, Nick!

21:38.174 --> 21:39.441
I was here first!

21:39.575 --> 21:42.411
And yet it only matters
who's last.

21:42.844 --> 21:44.880
Thanks for leading us here.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.282
Fuck you, Nick.

21:47.183 --> 21:48.584
She's not yours...

21:48.918 --> 21:50.519
You're falling apart.

21:51.220 --> 21:53.522
Maybe you should go back
to Joan and your little

21:53.688 --> 21:55.991
animal shelter
until you feel better.

22:27.423 --> 22:29.191
Ah!

22:34.029 --> 22:35.231
Joan.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.936
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

22:41.136 --> 22:44.473
I led Nicholas right to her.
He captured her and he...

22:47.042 --> 22:49.445
I saw an alkonost fetus
die right in front of me.

22:49.578 --> 22:50.578
Shh...

22:50.879 --> 22:53.882
It's okay now, grey.

22:54.116 --> 22:56.118
I need you back on your feet.

22:56.252 --> 22:57.252
There's been news...

22:57.519 --> 22:58.887
About the Baku.

22:59.521 --> 23:00.521
What?

23:00.556 --> 23:01.957
- The Baku?
- Yes.

23:02.157 --> 23:04.593
She's somewhere
in North America now.

23:04.826 --> 23:07.630
The U.S. military got a hold
of her, but of course,

23:07.762 --> 23:10.232
she managed
to escape her captors.

23:10.532 --> 23:11.532
Where?

23:11.600 --> 23:13.302
We've got a lead.

23:13.669 --> 23:16.071
We fly out tonight but...

23:16.538 --> 23:18.741
Grey, I'm worried about you.

23:18.873 --> 23:20.276
No, I'm fine.

23:20.609 --> 23:23.279
I can't lose you,

23:23.746 --> 23:26.515
so I'm giving you some help.

23:26.649 --> 23:29.018
What? I don't need...

23:29.851 --> 23:30.953
He'll just slow me down.

23:31.086 --> 23:32.988
<i>Her</i> name is Phoebe.

23:33.455 --> 23:36.759
She really understands
the cryptid experience.

23:36.892 --> 23:39.161
We need someone
like her on our team.

23:39.295 --> 23:41.530
It looks good for us.
And you'll like her.

23:41.764 --> 23:43.365
I like her.

23:43.565 --> 23:45.434
You know I'm best working alone.

23:45.567 --> 23:46.567
Yes...

23:46.735 --> 23:49.104
But you also work for me.

23:49.238 --> 23:53.242
And I say you're in no condition
to do this by yourself.

23:55.311 --> 23:56.844
Come in, Phoebe.

23:59.581 --> 24:00.949
Hi, miss grey.

24:01.150 --> 24:03.152
I've read your file and I know

24:03.252 --> 24:05.120
how important
the Baku is to you,

24:05.254 --> 24:07.323
and she's important
to me too because I'm...

24:07.589 --> 24:08.991
Are you ready to risk dying,

24:09.124 --> 24:11.894
to get a Japanese
dream-eating cryptid?

24:12.161 --> 24:13.161
Yes.

24:13.228 --> 24:14.229
Why?

24:14.530 --> 24:16.031
It's important to me.

24:16.465 --> 24:17.566
Why?

24:25.474 --> 24:26.542
This is who I am.

24:26.675 --> 24:28.444
And I should not
have to hide it.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.246
Phoebe is a gorgon.

24:31.380 --> 24:34.450
She wears contacts and
tranquilizes her snakes

24:34.583 --> 24:35.884
to fit in with the public.

24:36.418 --> 24:39.854
She knows firsthand how
the wider world treats cryptids,

24:39.988 --> 24:44.426
and how important it is for them
to have a safe home,

24:44.560 --> 24:46.395
where outcasts are welcome.

24:47.763 --> 24:50.566
So let's welcome her.

25:00.476 --> 25:04.179
The Baku may be the most
powerful cryptid on the planet.

25:06.882 --> 25:09.184
<i>She feeds on dreams.</i>

25:09.985 --> 25:12.187
<i>She can be a force for good.</i>

25:12.321 --> 25:15.190
<i>But she could also do
irreparable harm.</i>

25:15.524 --> 25:18.327
Babe, I had the coolest dream
last night...

25:18.794 --> 25:22.030
<i>The U.S. government wants
to harness the Baku,</i>

25:22.564 --> 25:25.834
<i>to wipe out the dreams
of the counterculture.</i>

25:26.201 --> 25:28.437
<i>Suck them away into nothing.</i>

25:29.505 --> 25:33.242
<i>Without dreams,
there can be no future.</i>

25:35.411 --> 25:36.645
Who's our lead?

25:37.446 --> 25:40.816
We know that the Baku
was captured in okinawa,

25:41.016 --> 25:42.684
stolen from Japanese collectors,

25:42.818 --> 25:46.622
and flown to a secret military
base somewhere in the midwest.

25:47.823 --> 25:51.360
<i>She was being transferred
to a cryptid holding facility</i>

25:51.493 --> 25:53.495
<i>when she managed
to free herself.</i>

25:53.762 --> 25:56.165
<i>We don't know
where the Baku went,</i>

25:56.331 --> 26:00.469
<i>but there was a second cryptid
who escaped at the same time.</i>

26:00.669 --> 26:02.471
<i>He's in Florida right now.</i>

26:02.604 --> 26:04.206
<i>So we need to go to him,</i>

26:04.406 --> 26:07.309
<i>and find out what he knows
about the Baku.</i>

26:24.026 --> 26:26.528
I'm so glad you're with us.

26:28.797 --> 26:30.699
That's lovely!

26:31.533 --> 26:32.968
<i>Thanks.</i>

26:34.069 --> 26:36.906
I started having dreams of
Jay and me being married,

26:37.039 --> 26:39.274
and I always listen
to my dreams.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.743
Where's the wedding going to be?

26:42.578 --> 26:45.514
<i>An island called belle isle...</i>

26:46.582 --> 26:48.250
<i>When the water is shallow,</i>

26:48.383 --> 26:50.719
<i>you can catch fish
with your hands.</i>

26:51.553 --> 26:53.655
<i>Sounds magical.</i>

26:54.256 --> 26:58.460
Just think...
Little half-cryptid babies!

26:58.594 --> 27:00.262
How interesting...

27:00.395 --> 27:02.331
How beautiful!

27:02.464 --> 27:04.266
Oh, I guess so.

27:28.524 --> 27:29.959
How's your leg?

27:30.092 --> 27:31.527
It's fine.

27:32.127 --> 27:33.362
Fine enough, anyway.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.733
What is that cane?

27:38.166 --> 27:39.668
It's a catch pole.

27:41.036 --> 27:43.539
I made my first rescue
with this.

27:44.072 --> 27:45.607
The last Pegasus...

27:46.275 --> 27:48.143
I named her Gloria.

27:48.644 --> 27:50.512
You caught her with that?

27:52.080 --> 27:54.216
She's okay now. You'll see.

27:54.951 --> 27:56.285
Oh, okay.

27:57.185 --> 28:00.622
This cryptid is
a humanoid, like you, Phoebe.

28:01.189 --> 28:03.792
So let's be mindful
not to refer to him

28:03.927 --> 28:05.962
as a creature or animal.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.197
His mother offered
to let us talk to him,

28:09.331 --> 28:11.466
so long as we
take him back with us and

28:11.600 --> 28:14.570
give him a home and
employment at the cryptozoo.

28:21.878 --> 28:23.445
Come inside.

28:27.050 --> 28:30.452
Oh, what a cutie-pie.

28:31.720 --> 28:32.956
Hi, pliny.

28:33.088 --> 28:34.790
My name is Lauren.

28:35.691 --> 28:37.459
I'm a doctor.

28:37.659 --> 28:40.462
I'm just going to look
at you, okay?

28:44.499 --> 28:45.667
Okay.

28:47.502 --> 28:49.605
You're doing really well, pliny.

28:52.942 --> 28:54.643
He has bruises on his back.

28:55.344 --> 28:58.014
It was those army men
who captured him.

28:58.246 --> 28:59.882
He's only a child.

29:00.049 --> 29:02.517
They took him all over,
in cages.

29:02.885 --> 29:04.586
They beat him.

29:04.820 --> 29:06.154
I'm so sorry.

29:11.727 --> 29:13.930
Pliny's gonna love his new life.

29:14.063 --> 29:16.231
He'll be with his own kind.

29:16.565 --> 29:17.599
I'm his kind.

29:17.733 --> 29:18.867
I'm his mother.

29:19.068 --> 29:20.168
Yes...

29:20.402 --> 29:21.470
I know.

29:21.637 --> 29:23.305
He'll make friends.

29:23.438 --> 29:26.042
As soon as he tells us
about the Baku,

29:26.174 --> 29:27.376
we'll go straight there.

29:27.509 --> 29:28.210
No.

29:28.310 --> 29:30.579
First, you get us to California,

29:30.712 --> 29:33.315
then pliny tells to you
what he knows.

29:33.482 --> 29:34.482
But...

29:34.783 --> 29:38.186
We need to get to
the Baku right away.

29:38.353 --> 29:39.821
You can trust us.

29:40.056 --> 29:41.390
I don't trust you.

29:41.523 --> 29:45.560
And I'm not just handing my son
over to strange people.

29:45.727 --> 29:47.063
I'm coming with you.

29:47.596 --> 29:49.264
Pliny will give you
the information

29:49.464 --> 29:51.166
after we have seen the home.

29:51.299 --> 29:53.802
Also, I want 400 dollars.

29:54.369 --> 29:58.206
- That was not the agreement.
- 400 u.S.A. Dollars...

29:58.340 --> 30:00.676
To show you are serious.
Or no deal.

30:01.010 --> 30:04.047
You are not the only ones
who want to talk to my boy.

30:04.179 --> 30:05.280
You know?

30:05.882 --> 30:07.649
- Alright.
- Joan!

30:10.185 --> 30:11.954
Four hundred it is.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.189
Okay, c'mon, pliny.

30:14.589 --> 30:16.926
It's time to see your new home.

30:22.464 --> 30:24.332
<i>I met Joan years ago</i>

30:24.466 --> 30:26.635
<i>and was moved
by her vision of a place for</i>

30:26.735 --> 30:29.504
<i>all the unloved animals
in the world.</i>

30:32.507 --> 30:34.443
<i>After I got
my veterinary degree,</i>

30:34.576 --> 30:38.213
<i>I traveled half-way across
the globe to work here.</i>

30:44.319 --> 30:47.522
<i>"Cryptozoo" is just
a catchy title for marketing.</i>

30:47.656 --> 30:50.893
<i>We think of it as more
of a sanctuary than a zoo.</i>

30:51.027 --> 30:53.862
<i>Soon the whole world
will see what we've done.</i>

30:55.230 --> 30:58.101
It doesn't look much like
a sanctuary.

30:58.233 --> 30:59.936
More like a shopping mall.

31:00.002 --> 31:01.002
Yeah...

31:01.303 --> 31:04.372
The initial funding came
from Joan's inheritance but

31:04.606 --> 31:06.909
if this place is going to be
able to sustain itself

31:06.976 --> 31:07.676
over a long term,

31:07.876 --> 31:09.979
it's gotta generate
a lot of revenue.

31:10.245 --> 31:11.948
We need to be tourist-friendly.

31:12.581 --> 31:14.951
It doesn't change anything
about our mission.

31:16.185 --> 31:18.653
It's just not
what I was expecting.

31:19.287 --> 31:21.857
Well, it's very progressive,
I think.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.227
I mean the shops are staffed
with both cryptids

31:24.359 --> 31:26.129
and non-cryptids,
working together.

31:26.495 --> 31:28.830
Maybe you'll work
at one of these stores, pliny.

31:28.965 --> 31:29.966
Wow!

31:30.732 --> 31:32.034
Oh, my god!

31:33.635 --> 31:36.505
We have dolls of
every confirmed cryptid.

31:37.839 --> 31:39.909
Pliny, it's you!

31:40.442 --> 31:42.677
You don't think
it's a little tacky?

31:42.979 --> 31:43.845
Think of it this way,

31:43.980 --> 31:46.916
a hundred dolls sold
is one saved cryptid.

31:47.582 --> 31:49.484
- Ah.
- Besides, look,

31:49.684 --> 31:50.752
he loves it.

31:51.787 --> 31:52.821
C'mon.

31:53.655 --> 31:57.260
The cryptozoo is organized
by continent of origin.

31:57.392 --> 32:00.695
Walking clockwise
around the center lake,

32:00.829 --> 32:02.198
home to our kraken,

32:02.364 --> 32:05.567
you go from North America
to South America,

32:05.700 --> 32:09.805
to Africa to Australia to Europe
to Antarctica to Asia!

32:09.972 --> 32:12.307
<i>We'll have guided tours
every half hour,</i>

32:12.407 --> 32:13.775
<i>and culturally-appropriate food</i>

32:13.875 --> 32:15.577
<i>served in the cafes
in each zone.</i>

32:15.677 --> 32:17.412
<i>So visitors who come
to see something</i>

32:17.546 --> 32:18.613
<i>totally out of this world</i>

32:18.680 --> 32:20.849
<i>will be learning
about our world.</i>

32:21.017 --> 32:22.151
<i>Our world.</i>

32:22.350 --> 32:24.220
That's the thing for me, pliny.

32:24.352 --> 32:27.290
This place is
absolute proof we exist.

32:27.422 --> 32:30.692
Out there, people think of us
as imaginary beasts.

32:30.826 --> 32:33.829
But most mythological beings
are simply

32:34.030 --> 32:36.032
extremely rare beings.

32:36.232 --> 32:37.499
We're real, too.

32:37.866 --> 32:40.002
Let's help the public
get hip to the fact

32:40.136 --> 32:41.270
that we're normal.

32:41.403 --> 32:42.571
And then maybe one day,

32:42.704 --> 32:44.840
we can feel safe
anywhere in the world,

32:44.974 --> 32:46.741
not just in a protected zoo.

32:47.676 --> 32:50.445
<i>Welcome to the karzelek cave!</i>

32:51.113 --> 32:55.650
<i>In Polish mythology,
karzeleks are elf-like beings</i>

32:55.784 --> 33:00.122
<i>that punish unwary travelers
by pummeling them with rocks.</i>

33:00.622 --> 33:05.094
<i>But these tricksters also
love to dance and entertain.</i>

33:08.730 --> 33:09.798
Wow...

33:11.633 --> 33:14.003
Oh.

33:17.139 --> 33:18.773
C'mon, there's even more.

33:22.311 --> 33:25.680
So the value is
a European mountain cryptid.

33:26.182 --> 33:27.716
We found him in a hidden valley

33:27.816 --> 33:29.919
in a remote corner
of the pyrenees.

33:30.052 --> 33:31.753
He was utterly savage but,

33:31.988 --> 33:35.490
as he's spent time here,
Joan domesticated him.

33:35.624 --> 33:37.559
She named him Vaughn.

33:40.762 --> 33:42.031
Hm...

33:44.166 --> 33:48.004
Of course, we do have
some untamable creatures...

33:48.137 --> 33:50.139
There's the kraken. A hydra.

33:50.273 --> 33:52.507
A flying roc. A tarasque.

33:52.741 --> 33:55.610
And the camoodi,
the longest snake in the world.

33:58.347 --> 34:01.816
This way are the Luz mala
of South America.

34:02.484 --> 34:04.954
You know will o' the wisp?
They're like that.

34:06.454 --> 34:08.958
They mesmerize people
into following them.

34:10.026 --> 34:12.727
That's how they got the name
"the evil lights."

34:14.529 --> 34:16.631
But they're not really
evil at all.

34:16.933 --> 34:20.136
People always fear what
they don't understand, you know?

34:27.642 --> 34:29.078
They are alive?

34:29.211 --> 34:30.279
Mm-hm.

34:31.113 --> 34:34.216
They're made up of gas,
but they are sentient.

34:36.419 --> 34:39.322
Here they perform behind glass
as a light show.

34:40.122 --> 34:43.993
Intelligence has nothing to do
with appearance.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.662
Some of the more
beastly cryptids are

34:47.796 --> 34:50.099
much more intelligent
than the humanoids.

34:50.366 --> 34:52.034
Like the Baku...

34:52.168 --> 34:54.569
Well, these lights are smart.

34:54.836 --> 34:56.838
Pretty far out, right, pliny?

35:00.809 --> 35:03.012
- Are there dragons?
- Yes.

35:03.245 --> 35:05.714
Oh, I want one as a pet.

35:06.082 --> 35:09.484
Joan has a baby Chinese dragon.
She keeps her in the tower.

35:10.286 --> 35:12.989
Joan's office and
living quarters are up there.

35:15.424 --> 35:18.094
The cryptozoo
is her whole life...

35:18.227 --> 35:20.162
Her great utopian dream.

35:37.079 --> 35:40.615
Vaughn, oh!

35:52.428 --> 35:53.628
<i>We can only greet</i>

35:53.762 --> 35:56.798
<i>the strange
and unusual with love.</i>

35:57.333 --> 35:59.201
<i>And if we show them love,</i>

35:59.834 --> 36:02.837
<i>they will return love.</i>

36:03.072 --> 36:07.709
<i>And love will spread
and envelop all of the beings</i>

36:07.842 --> 36:11.813
<i>on our diverse, wondrous world.</i>

36:18.254 --> 36:20.189
Welcome to your new home.

36:20.555 --> 36:22.624
You have a bath and a TV.

36:24.626 --> 36:26.795
<i>Every year, adds new lusters of</i>

36:26.929 --> 36:29.131
<i>thunderbirds' reputation...</i>

36:30.799 --> 36:32.634
Okay, so you're here.

36:33.069 --> 36:34.070
Pliny?

36:34.370 --> 36:36.305
Listen. Okay?

36:38.174 --> 36:41.043
It's hard to believe that
such a gentle little thing

36:41.210 --> 36:44.980
could destroy the future if
she fell into the wrong hands,

36:45.147 --> 36:46.648
but it's true.

36:47.249 --> 36:50.519
We need to get to her
before the army does, okay?

36:50.986 --> 36:54.290
She saved me,
when I was about your age.

36:55.191 --> 36:56.892
And I owe it to her.

36:57.659 --> 36:59.161
What do you remember?

37:02.164 --> 37:03.865
It's okay, pliny.

37:04.166 --> 37:05.800
You tell them now.

37:07.236 --> 37:08.603
Maysville.

37:08.938 --> 37:10.772
- What?
- What did he say?

37:11.340 --> 37:13.309
Maysville, Kentucky.

37:14.410 --> 37:16.378
Thank you. Thank you, pliny.

37:17.413 --> 37:20.516
Okay, was the Baku with anyone?

37:21.317 --> 37:25.020
What's the last thing you saw?

37:26.555 --> 37:27.890
Kitty.

37:29.191 --> 37:30.292
A kitty?

37:31.427 --> 37:32.561
Kitty cat.

37:32.694 --> 37:33.929
Black kitty cat.

37:34.296 --> 37:37.600
Did the black kitty cat
take the Baku, pliny?

37:37.832 --> 37:40.035
Yes...

37:40.702 --> 37:43.939
Who? Who is the black cat?

37:44.540 --> 37:45.540
Pliny?

37:45.707 --> 37:47.343
That's enough questions.

37:47.476 --> 37:49.644
He said all he knows.

37:50.146 --> 37:51.413
He rest now.

38:06.228 --> 38:07.263
Mm...

38:11.666 --> 38:13.536
- You're leaving again.
- Yeah...

38:13.668 --> 38:16.405
We need to go find something.
Someone.

38:16.605 --> 38:18.340
Well, when will you be back?

38:18.941 --> 38:21.110
I don't know. Soon. Hopefully.

38:21.310 --> 38:24.613
C'mon, phoebes, we moved here
to start a new life.

38:24.812 --> 38:26.982
Find an apartment.
Plan our wedding.

38:27.183 --> 38:29.919
I've been stuck alone in
this hotel room for a week now

38:30.052 --> 38:31.620
while you're flying
all over the world.

38:31.753 --> 38:32.820
I'm sorry, Jay.

38:33.355 --> 38:36.225
I want to just be with you too,
but this is the job.

38:36.392 --> 38:39.261
What we're doing is
really important, I think.

38:39.461 --> 38:41.564
A wedding isn't important?

38:42.064 --> 38:44.934
I have to make the seating
arrangement for my family.

38:45.467 --> 38:47.369
At least you have a family.

38:48.003 --> 38:50.406
I don't because I'm a cryptid.

38:51.073 --> 38:53.509
The cryptozoo is maybe
the only place

38:53.642 --> 38:54.809
in the entire world

38:54.910 --> 38:57.513
where cryptids can have a home.

38:58.013 --> 39:01.116
It might look like a fucking
amusement park, but...

39:01.483 --> 39:02.483
I'm sorry.

39:02.585 --> 39:04.320
I get it, sweetie.

39:04.486 --> 39:06.222
I just miss you is all.

39:07.223 --> 39:08.856
I know.

39:09.625 --> 39:11.260
We're gonna be married.

39:12.661 --> 39:14.363
I'm gonna be your husband.

39:16.498 --> 39:17.499
I know.

39:17.633 --> 39:19.101
It's out of sight.

39:42.124 --> 39:43.858
I hate towns like this.

39:45.894 --> 39:47.463
Lots of police.

39:47.930 --> 39:49.698
Fuck.

39:49.864 --> 39:51.367
That's Nicholas.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.500
It has to be.

39:52.635 --> 39:54.169
He's ex-military.
Extremely smart.

39:54.303 --> 39:56.605
- Obsessed with cryptids.
- Why?

39:56.739 --> 39:58.641
What does he want with them?

39:58.773 --> 40:00.009
He wants to sell them,

40:00.142 --> 40:02.878
as bio weapons,
to the U.S. armed forces.

40:03.112 --> 40:05.447
The military know they lost
the Baku around here,

40:05.581 --> 40:06.882
so they brought him in.

40:07.049 --> 40:09.184
He's the best
at finding cryptids.

40:09.652 --> 40:11.987
The best except for me,
of course.

40:12.388 --> 40:13.455
Look.

40:13.756 --> 40:15.291
Black kitty cat.

41:16.118 --> 41:18.020
You dance anywhere before?

41:18.987 --> 41:21.023
No. Not really.

41:21.490 --> 41:23.192
You've got a cute face.

41:23.392 --> 41:24.927
Can I see your tits?

41:25.828 --> 41:27.896
Oh, yeah.

41:31.667 --> 41:32.701
That's alright.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.403
Some guys dig that.

41:35.504 --> 41:36.905
How about your ass?

41:37.806 --> 41:39.108
Uh...

41:42.611 --> 41:44.880
Ah, now we're in business.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.348
Mm...

41:47.049 --> 41:48.417
What's back there?

41:48.550 --> 41:49.351
Hold on...

41:49.418 --> 41:51.387
I've seen a lot of wigs
in my day.

41:51.687 --> 41:53.122
That one's top notch.

41:53.255 --> 41:55.090
- What've you got under there?
- I...

42:22.985 --> 42:25.454
Lauren grey!

42:25.889 --> 42:26.989
Gustav.

42:27.055 --> 42:29.758
Funny seeing you here.

42:29.992 --> 42:31.393
I could say the same.

42:32.161 --> 42:35.764
And of all the places a low-life
pervert could hide out,

42:35.899 --> 42:38.500
you choose a club
in the same shithole town

42:38.634 --> 42:39.802
that the Baku went missing?

42:39.935 --> 42:44.506
I'm just enjoying
some southern belles.

42:46.175 --> 42:48.544
If you know where the Baku is,
you better tell me right now.

42:48.677 --> 42:51.547
I'm outta that game, honest.

42:52.448 --> 42:55.017
If you're lying,
you'll regret it.

42:56.452 --> 43:00.155
You won't find
your Baku here, Lauren.

43:05.861 --> 43:07.362
Don't. You'll mess it up.

43:07.529 --> 43:09.998
Oh... but I like seeing girls
all fucked up.

43:10.132 --> 43:11.266
Hey, back off.

43:12.701 --> 43:14.303
What the fuck is that?

43:15.103 --> 43:17.806
Where is mariko?
We know you have her.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.675
I got no girls by that name.

43:20.108 --> 43:21.577
Are you pigs?

43:23.913 --> 43:25.614
He doesn't have shit.

43:26.048 --> 43:27.683
Let's shag ass.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.755
Sorry you had to deal
with that creep.

43:33.890 --> 43:36.658
It's okay.
Just sucks it's a dead end.

43:36.792 --> 43:37.894
We'll keep looking.

43:38.026 --> 43:39.328
I have an idea.

43:56.778 --> 44:01.918
We heard there was a wild animal
in the neighborhood last week.

44:02.050 --> 44:03.987
Did you happen
to see anything or...

44:04.319 --> 44:06.522
Like a bear or something?

44:07.456 --> 44:11.260
Yeah, it looks
partly like a bear.

44:11.426 --> 44:13.295
You obviously love animals.

44:13.428 --> 44:15.731
We were thinking you might
have taken it in

44:15.864 --> 44:17.132
if you came across it?

44:17.432 --> 44:20.302
No, no, I haven't seen anything.

44:20.970 --> 44:22.538
Oh, okay.

44:22.704 --> 44:24.273
Well, thanks anyway.

44:29.578 --> 44:31.346
Well, that was a waste of time.

44:32.982 --> 44:35.952
If the Baku is out here,
she's starving to death.

44:36.485 --> 44:38.687
Nobody has any big dreams here.

44:38.820 --> 44:40.489
Hmm, I don't get it.

44:40.689 --> 44:42.992
If I lived out here,
or in the country,

44:43.125 --> 44:44.660
we'd have all this space.

44:44.793 --> 44:46.728
I could let my hair down...

44:46.896 --> 44:48.363
Have a yard, kids.

44:48.497 --> 44:51.533
Don't you find the city people
to be more open-minded?

44:51.667 --> 44:54.003
Not to having a gorgon
for a neighbor.

44:54.836 --> 44:58.540
I just worry the outside world
is never going to accept us.

44:58.674 --> 44:59.708
Not really.

44:59.841 --> 45:01.543
Even with the cryptozoo.

45:01.677 --> 45:05.614
The best we can hope for is to
be treated like circus freaks.

45:05.747 --> 45:06.782
Think about pliny.

45:06.950 --> 45:10.285
Serving popcorn to tourists
who tease and stare at him?

45:10.452 --> 45:14.756
No, the cryptozoo is going
to change things gradually.

45:14.991 --> 45:17.060
Things will be different
for pliny's kids.

45:17.259 --> 45:18.760
Your kids even.

45:19.127 --> 45:21.163
People will learn
to be more accepting.

45:21.330 --> 45:24.232
The cryptozoo is a necessary
stepping stone.

45:25.801 --> 45:27.003
C'mon. Let's ride.

45:27.135 --> 45:29.871
The Baku will turn up,
I'm sure of it.

45:58.834 --> 45:59.834
Look.

46:01.703 --> 46:02.905
Worth a try?

46:12.414 --> 46:15.450
I collect rare and
unusual tarot decks.

46:16.218 --> 46:18.620
Each has its own story.

46:19.388 --> 46:21.090
Get a reading, Lauren.

46:21.490 --> 46:23.893
Do you have a question
for the cards?

46:24.159 --> 46:25.427
Yes...

46:25.727 --> 46:26.728
I'm...

46:27.329 --> 46:29.264
I'm looking for someone.

46:36.204 --> 46:38.740
This is the waite-Smith deck,

46:39.075 --> 46:41.209
drawn by Pamela colman Smith.

46:41.343 --> 46:42.644
It's my favorite.

46:43.245 --> 46:45.280
I think it suits you.

46:45.447 --> 46:46.447
Oh...

46:46.983 --> 46:48.183
Okay.

46:49.451 --> 46:51.453
While you're shuffling
the cards,

46:51.586 --> 46:54.690
you must think back to
the last time you saw her.

46:59.128 --> 47:00.762
We won't do reverse cards,

47:00.897 --> 47:03.699
as there are enough complexities
and contradictions

47:03.832 --> 47:05.434
in the deck itself.

47:13.375 --> 47:16.311
I haven't seen her
since I was a little girl.

47:21.184 --> 47:22.651
Yes...

47:24.921 --> 47:26.421
Now put it down,

47:27.156 --> 47:28.690
and cut the deck.

47:33.261 --> 47:35.363
Now take those stacks
and cut them.

47:36.999 --> 47:38.266
Like this?

47:41.070 --> 47:43.940
Each position relates to
a different suit of the tarot.

47:44.439 --> 47:45.807
One for the wands,

47:45.942 --> 47:48.111
then the swords, then the cups,

47:48.343 --> 47:50.545
and finally, the pentacles.

47:51.147 --> 47:53.381
The reading proceeds
through the suits,

47:53.548 --> 47:55.417
from beginning to end.

47:55.584 --> 47:56.618
Got it?

47:56.818 --> 47:57.887
I think so.

47:58.955 --> 48:00.622
Turn over the first card.

48:03.025 --> 48:04.093
Hmm...

48:04.227 --> 48:05.761
The hanged man.

48:07.262 --> 48:09.664
Look, he's upside down.

48:10.565 --> 48:13.236
He has a different perspective
than the rest of us.

48:13.435 --> 48:14.904
He is enlightened.

48:15.537 --> 48:19.008
You see things in the world
that others do not see.

48:20.609 --> 48:23.278
You see the hidden world.

48:25.480 --> 48:26.748
Yes.

48:27.616 --> 48:32.088
Now, let's see how this is then
channeled through the swords,

48:32.221 --> 48:33.789
intelligence.

48:36.092 --> 48:37.359
Oh...

48:37.960 --> 48:39.394
Three of pentacles.

48:39.561 --> 48:41.630
This quest is your job.

48:42.064 --> 48:45.634
You work with two others.
You are the pentacle, the body.

48:45.767 --> 48:48.004
The others are the heart
and the brain.

48:48.137 --> 48:51.174
It is important for all three
to be in alignment, right?

48:51.339 --> 48:52.909
Yeah... yes.

48:53.742 --> 48:55.912
Now we must move
into the future.

48:56.645 --> 48:59.081
First, let's see
what your quest will cost you.

49:01.850 --> 49:03.019
Oh...

49:05.021 --> 49:06.521
The tower.

49:07.455 --> 49:08.958
I'm so sorry.

49:09.791 --> 49:12.360
This will come
at a great cost to you.

49:12.828 --> 49:15.363
- Your work will...
- But will I find her?

49:16.933 --> 49:19.969
Wands, swords, cups.

49:20.102 --> 49:22.704
Now, finally, pentacles.

49:23.572 --> 49:26.675
The material world.
The end of your reading.

49:34.917 --> 49:36.585
So what is it?

49:37.652 --> 49:39.956
You're here for the dream-eater.

49:52.101 --> 49:53.768
She's gorgeous.

49:54.769 --> 49:56.939
Does anyone else
know she's here?

49:57.073 --> 49:58.073
No.

49:58.140 --> 49:59.909
She came straight to me.

50:00.809 --> 50:02.078
I'm like you.

50:02.211 --> 50:04.247
I see the hidden world, too.

50:04.947 --> 50:07.616
She knew this was
the safest place for her.

50:09.952 --> 50:11.553
Hi there, mariko.

50:13.521 --> 50:15.157
Do you remember me?

50:17.459 --> 50:19.461
I've had so many nightmares.

50:19.728 --> 50:20.728
But she...

50:20.829 --> 50:23.865
Mariko has eaten
nearly all of them now.

50:24.866 --> 50:26.202
How does it work?

50:26.701 --> 50:30.006
You can suggest things
you want to disappear...

50:30.139 --> 50:33.441
By dwelling on them
just before you fall asleep.

50:33.642 --> 50:36.678
Or she'll just latch onto
your head

50:36.811 --> 50:39.348
and suck out
whatever dreams she wants.

50:39.514 --> 50:42.784
- Does it hurt?
- No. Not at all.

50:43.986 --> 50:45.687
It just disappears.

50:45.988 --> 50:46.988
Yeah.

50:49.125 --> 50:50.759
Go get the carrier.

50:50.960 --> 50:51.960
Right.

50:59.168 --> 51:00.635
That's her.

51:06.775 --> 51:08.843
- You can't just...
- Hey, hey.

51:08.978 --> 51:09.978
Who's this now?

51:10.046 --> 51:12.747
- You're with grey?
- We won't hurt you.

51:12.915 --> 51:14.283
I don't have to...

51:14.417 --> 51:15.417
Answer!

51:15.583 --> 51:17.219
You two have the Baku?

51:17.353 --> 51:19.521
That thing's not for kids, girl.

51:20.256 --> 51:21.823
Fuck you, meatheads!

51:24.859 --> 51:25.962
Ahh!

51:28.197 --> 51:30.132
- A medusa!
- I'm a gorgon!

51:33.735 --> 51:34.469
Ahh!

51:34.736 --> 51:37.672
I knew she was
a cryptid. I could tell.

51:38.174 --> 51:39.942
Humanoids are tough to tame.

51:40.409 --> 51:41.576
You can't...

51:41.710 --> 51:44.013
You can't do this!

51:44.479 --> 51:45.647
I think we can, actually,

51:45.780 --> 51:48.084
considering you just
killed a man.

51:52.821 --> 51:55.657
Don't you think some things
are meant to stay hidden?

51:56.892 --> 51:59.494
But that's how they get lost.

52:00.062 --> 52:01.830
I can't lose her again.

52:05.334 --> 52:06.335
<i>Miss grey!</i>

52:06.768 --> 52:09.105
<i>We have
your gorgon servant girl!</i>

52:09.604 --> 52:11.340
<i>The animal in there
is the property</i>

52:11.440 --> 52:12.707
<i>of the U.S. military.</i>

52:12.841 --> 52:14.110
- Fuck!
- <i>We're coming in!</i>

52:15.077 --> 52:16.145
We gotta hide her.

52:23.319 --> 52:24.387
- Hey!
- Argh!

52:29.925 --> 52:31.760
Get him!

52:32.128 --> 52:34.330
Ah!

52:35.697 --> 52:37.266
Okay, okay, okay.

52:39.734 --> 52:41.536
Jesus Christ, lady.

52:42.637 --> 52:44.173
- Go on.
- Damn it.

53:00.489 --> 53:01.891
Let's go.

53:04.592 --> 53:07.762
Remember, listen to your heart.

53:12.268 --> 53:14.103
Get your hands off of me!

53:16.105 --> 53:17.105
Gustav!

53:17.306 --> 53:20.076
I should've known you were
working with this asshole.

53:20.242 --> 53:23.079
Hey, a job is a job.

53:23.212 --> 53:26.348
What? I should go and dance
at your park?

53:26.482 --> 53:27.950
That shit's demeaning.

53:28.384 --> 53:31.487
I risked my life to get you
out of that prison cell.

53:31.686 --> 53:33.422
And now you work for a zoo.

53:33.721 --> 53:35.657
You've always been
so righteous, grey.

53:35.790 --> 53:37.659
But you know
we're not so different.

53:37.792 --> 53:41.464
We were both raised military.
You hunt exotic game, too.

53:41.629 --> 53:43.798
You like to tell a pretty story
about yourself.

53:43.933 --> 53:45.401
But this isn't a fairytale.

53:46.068 --> 53:48.803
Look, these animals
are strong weapons.

53:48.938 --> 53:50.973
We could end the war
with these things.

53:51.340 --> 53:53.109
That's what weapons are for.

53:53.275 --> 53:55.311
I'd think your parents
would've taught you that.

53:55.478 --> 53:57.079
You are a monster.

53:57.779 --> 53:59.515
Takes one to know one.

54:00.282 --> 54:03.751
Put the Baku in the tomahawk
and load the skirts in with me.

54:05.154 --> 54:07.056
Nice work once again.

54:07.189 --> 54:11.293
There's no reason to be
too rough with them, is there?

54:11.427 --> 54:13.661
Hah, you play the good cop.

54:13.795 --> 54:14.897
I'm sorry, Lauren.

54:15.030 --> 54:17.566
No, I should've gone with you.

54:17.765 --> 54:19.401
- No.
- It's my fault.

54:19.535 --> 54:21.170
I'm supposed to protect you.

54:21.303 --> 54:23.405
No, we protect each other.

54:23.539 --> 54:25.307
Oh, this is so sweet.

54:25.541 --> 54:27.809
You're through, you know?
It's over.

54:27.943 --> 54:30.012
Now my client gets the Baku,
as promised.

54:30.212 --> 54:32.052
And thanks to your little
murderer friend here,

54:32.148 --> 54:33.883
they have all
the legal excuses they need

54:34.016 --> 54:36.185
to shut down your monster zoo.

54:38.621 --> 54:41.390
- It's a sanctuary.
- A stepping stone.

54:41.557 --> 54:43.359
It's a carnival.

54:43.526 --> 54:45.594
What it is
is a giant holding pen.

54:45.727 --> 54:47.729
All those cryptids,
in one place.

54:47.897 --> 54:50.798
Do you really think the public
would be ready for that?

54:51.167 --> 54:54.736
I'm sure that with a real
purpose, they'll be happier.

55:11.554 --> 55:13.289
I should thank you, grey.

55:13.422 --> 55:14.689
You did a great job.

55:15.291 --> 55:16.926
Mission accomplished.

55:17.159 --> 55:20.062
We have to be there
to see them confiscated.

55:20.695 --> 55:21.964
Let's go, Joe.

55:22.097 --> 55:25.634
Cryptozoo, California.

55:25.733 --> 55:27.036
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

56:28.631 --> 56:30.165
What'll you do, Lauren?

56:30.299 --> 56:33.902
I mean if you're not in jail
for resisting arrest.

56:34.270 --> 56:37.573
You gonna sit around getting
stoned like everybody else?

56:37.706 --> 56:38.706
No.

56:39.008 --> 56:41.010
Once we have
all your little pets,

56:41.143 --> 56:43.312
you'll be handing in
your resume to me.

56:43.811 --> 56:47.416
If you love to collect cryptids,
it's hard to kick.

56:47.716 --> 56:49.251
I know how it is.

56:49.385 --> 56:52.154
What makes it fun is that
they don't want to be held.

56:52.521 --> 56:54.822
She'll never work for you.

56:54.957 --> 56:56.458
It's not so bad.

56:56.959 --> 56:59.827
Isn't that right,
my faun friend?

57:01.930 --> 57:04.033
<i>Uh, Nick... sir.</i>

57:04.166 --> 57:06.602
<i>The monsters, they're loose!</i>

57:07.002 --> 57:08.904
- What?
- What's wrong?

57:11.373 --> 57:14.209
Is this some kind of airshow
rehearsal bullshit?

57:14.376 --> 57:15.376
No!

57:15.444 --> 57:17.012
Something's wrong.

57:20.616 --> 57:21.816
Jesus!

57:25.020 --> 57:27.122
- No!
- What's happening?

57:28.424 --> 57:30.292
Mariko!

57:38.300 --> 57:40.835
- I'll take care of the devil.
- No, no, don't!

57:40.969 --> 57:42.604
Don't hurt him!

57:42.705 --> 57:44.073
He's the last tengu!

57:45.140 --> 57:47.009
Uncuff us! We can parachute out!

57:47.076 --> 57:48.177
Carefully!

57:48.477 --> 57:49.477
No!

57:49.511 --> 57:51.580
- I said carefully!
- Stop!

57:55.918 --> 57:57.052
Mariko!

57:59.521 --> 58:00.723
You don't love cryptids.

58:00.855 --> 58:01.990
You hate them!

58:02.124 --> 58:04.193
Holy shit!

58:05.194 --> 58:06.995
You don't have to hurt her!

58:07.129 --> 58:09.365
They're attacking on instinct.

58:09.598 --> 58:11.567
We're in their air space!

58:16.739 --> 58:17.806
Ugh!

58:17.940 --> 58:19.441
What the hell?

58:27.950 --> 58:29.485
You're gonna be alright.

58:32.755 --> 58:34.022
I'm sorry.

58:36.792 --> 58:37.893
Okay.

58:38.026 --> 58:39.628
Hah!

58:42.264 --> 58:45.367
Land the chopper
and she won't attack!

58:45.901 --> 58:47.836
Tell your bird to back off!

58:50.539 --> 58:52.307
You're making her angry!

58:53.475 --> 58:55.043
Holy shit!

58:55.811 --> 58:57.212
No, no!

59:11.760 --> 59:13.262
Where'd he go?

59:14.062 --> 59:15.497
I'm gonna do it.

59:21.804 --> 59:22.971
Ahh!

1:00:07.015 --> 1:00:08.417
Gustav!

1:00:10.152 --> 1:00:12.054
- Lauren!
- C'mon.

1:00:12.354 --> 1:00:14.590
You can swim
in the surface, Gustav.

1:00:14.723 --> 1:00:15.991
Let's go!

1:00:16.124 --> 1:00:17.626
- Okay, c'mon.
- I... I...

1:00:17.759 --> 1:00:19.094
I got you.

1:01:09.311 --> 1:01:11.413
Is the kraken
going to be alright?

1:01:11.580 --> 1:01:12.748
Yes...

1:01:12.916 --> 1:01:14.918
It will just have a sore throat.

1:01:15.050 --> 1:01:16.351
Okay, good.

1:01:26.395 --> 1:01:28.263
You didn't have to do that.

1:01:28.463 --> 1:01:30.666
Uncuff Phoebe!

1:01:30.766 --> 1:01:32.001
- Uncuff her!
- Fuck you!

1:01:32.401 --> 1:01:34.938
I ought to shoot the both of you
right now, I mean, really.

1:01:35.070 --> 1:01:36.238
Don't.

1:01:37.006 --> 1:01:38.006
We need...

1:01:38.106 --> 1:01:40.208
We need them
to guide us out of here.

1:01:40.442 --> 1:01:42.177
A helicopter will pick us up.

1:01:42.344 --> 1:01:45.247
It could take hours for
a copter, you know, to come...

1:01:45.347 --> 1:01:47.951
So we might need our ladies.

1:01:48.317 --> 1:01:52.287
Doesn't it make more sense
to keep our options open?

1:01:53.388 --> 1:01:55.757
The gorg
covers her eyes right now,

1:01:55.892 --> 1:01:58.160
or I blast her brains out.

1:01:59.094 --> 1:02:01.064
- Tighter!
- Alright.

1:02:02.564 --> 1:02:04.533
Mariko.

1:02:04.700 --> 1:02:06.301
Oh, she's hurt.

1:02:06.970 --> 1:02:09.005
- No, uh-uh...
- I'm a vet.

1:02:09.237 --> 1:02:12.574
Yeah, let her see the magic pig.

1:02:12.874 --> 1:02:15.577
Mariko, you're gonna be fine.

1:02:15.945 --> 1:02:17.746
I need a stick and some cloth.

1:02:18.081 --> 1:02:21.583
- It's got a name?
- Oh, that's cute.

1:02:22.150 --> 1:02:23.619
Mariko.

1:02:24.653 --> 1:02:27.422
How long have the cryptids
been loose?

1:02:27.823 --> 1:02:29.291
I don't know.

1:02:29.959 --> 1:02:31.693
There you go, honey.

1:02:31.894 --> 1:02:32.929
There you go.

1:02:35.430 --> 1:02:37.766
- What's going on?
- Oh, man!

1:02:39.167 --> 1:02:42.105
- It's the camoodi.
- The what?

1:02:42.304 --> 1:02:44.573
A south American megaworm.

1:03:02.125 --> 1:03:04.093
Phoebe! Follow my voice!

1:03:04.192 --> 1:03:05.627
Where?

1:03:05.928 --> 1:03:07.863
- Where?
- Here!

1:03:08.764 --> 1:03:11.199
- Lauren!
- This way!

1:03:18.941 --> 1:03:20.242
Where are you?

1:03:27.182 --> 1:03:28.583
Phoebe!

1:03:30.019 --> 1:03:31.453
This way!

1:03:53.176 --> 1:03:54.843
Where are we now?

1:03:55.210 --> 1:03:56.845
The karzelek's cave.

1:03:58.647 --> 1:04:00.415
We'll be safe here, I think.

1:04:00.515 --> 1:04:01.515
<i>Welcome to...</i>

1:04:01.783 --> 1:04:03.294
- <i>the karzelek's cave.</i>
- Is there an opening?

1:04:03.318 --> 1:04:04.419
I gotta make a signal.

1:04:04.519 --> 1:04:07.389
In the center,
there's a cave heart.

1:04:07.556 --> 1:04:10.859
<i>Elf-like beings
that punish unwary travelers</i>

1:04:10.993 --> 1:04:12.962
<i>by pummeling them with rocks...</i>

1:04:15.464 --> 1:04:17.866
Lauren saved me before.

1:04:17.967 --> 1:04:19.168
And she can do it again.

1:04:19.301 --> 1:04:20.769
Ah, shut up!

1:04:20.903 --> 1:04:22.105
I'm in charge here.

1:04:22.205 --> 1:04:23.305
Hey!

1:04:24.539 --> 1:04:25.707
Look...

1:04:39.889 --> 1:04:41.289
Kill me.

1:04:43.658 --> 1:04:44.994
Are you human?

1:04:46.795 --> 1:04:48.363
Yes.

1:04:58.306 --> 1:04:59.674
What happened?

1:05:01.343 --> 1:05:02.912
It's all my fault...

1:05:04.180 --> 1:05:05.580
I was angry.

1:05:15.191 --> 1:05:18.627
<i>My boyfriend and I came
across a tall fence last night.</i>

1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:21.264
<i>C'mon, babe, have some faith!</i>

1:05:21.429 --> 1:05:25.268
<i>We climbed it into
this side of the cryptozoo.</i>

1:05:25.567 --> 1:05:27.702
<i>There could be magic here!</i>

1:05:28.403 --> 1:05:31.773
<i>Matthew was killed
this morning and I...</i>

1:05:39.714 --> 1:05:41.850
<i>I murdered the unicorn!</i>

1:05:44.887 --> 1:05:46.755
<i>I carried Matthew's body,</i>

1:05:46.923 --> 1:05:49.258
<i>but I couldn't get him
back across the fence,</i>

1:05:49.391 --> 1:05:50.960
<i>so I went looking for help.</i>

1:05:51.093 --> 1:05:52.195
<i>Hello!</i>

1:05:52.327 --> 1:05:54.563
<i>I called out,
but no one answered.</i>

1:05:56.531 --> 1:05:59.302
<i>Then I found these beasts,
howling in their cages,</i>

1:05:59.434 --> 1:06:01.336
<i>and I knew how they felt.</i>

1:06:03.438 --> 1:06:04.941
<i>I freed them.</i>

1:06:07.043 --> 1:06:08.743
<i>They came after me...</i>

1:06:09.778 --> 1:06:13.049
<i>But a winged horse
appeared from nowhere...</i>

1:06:13.582 --> 1:06:15.084
<i>And held them off.</i>

1:06:16.451 --> 1:06:18.054
<i>She saved me.</i>

1:06:19.155 --> 1:06:21.090
<i>And then she guided us here...</i>

1:06:24.492 --> 1:06:26.494
So I could Bury his body.

1:06:29.798 --> 1:06:31.067
Oh, geez.

1:06:34.337 --> 1:06:35.972
So you killed...

1:06:38.740 --> 1:06:39.909
I'm...

1:06:40.408 --> 1:06:41.978
I'm so sorry.

1:06:44.313 --> 1:06:46.715
We should've left
the unicorn alone.

1:06:48.351 --> 1:06:50.152
Oh!

1:07:02.164 --> 1:07:03.465
Woah...

1:07:06.735 --> 1:07:07.937
Joan...

1:07:09.272 --> 1:07:10.373
What is it?

1:07:10.505 --> 1:07:12.141
It's Joan's tower. It's falling.

1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:14.176
You've got to get to her!

1:07:14.343 --> 1:07:15.343
Go!

1:07:15.510 --> 1:07:17.013
- Gloria!
- Nah-uh.

1:07:17.146 --> 1:07:18.713
Stay right here!

1:07:18.780 --> 1:07:20.415
If anyone's taking
that gay horse,

1:07:20.482 --> 1:07:22.084
it's me with the Baku!

1:07:24.153 --> 1:07:25.854
No! Let her go!

1:07:27.522 --> 1:07:29.225
Lay off!

1:07:29.424 --> 1:07:30.960
No! Don't shoot!

1:07:31.093 --> 1:07:32.161
Please. Don't.

1:07:32.361 --> 1:07:33.361
Ouf!

1:07:35.497 --> 1:07:37.233
- Ahh!
- C'mon, girl.

1:07:37.532 --> 1:07:40.568
Fucking freaks
always stick together.

1:07:42.405 --> 1:07:44.006
No!

1:07:44.307 --> 1:07:46.142
Ahh!

1:07:46.275 --> 1:07:47.609
Gustav!

1:07:55.117 --> 1:07:58.054
Please forgive me.

1:08:00.289 --> 1:08:02.224
Go, Lauren, go!

1:08:02.358 --> 1:08:03.993
Come back here!

1:08:04.260 --> 1:08:05.794
Land it, you bitch!

1:08:23.511 --> 1:08:25.181
Oh, my god!

1:08:56.312 --> 1:08:58.513
Oh, my god!

1:09:04.987 --> 1:09:05.988
Jo...

1:09:08.324 --> 1:09:10.859
Steady, steady...

1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:14.562
Stay by the window, Gloria.

1:09:16.399 --> 1:09:17.766
Ahh!

1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:20.136
Ooh! Ugh!

1:09:24.140 --> 1:09:25.274
Joan!

1:09:25.774 --> 1:09:28.210
Joan! Where are you?

1:09:28.411 --> 1:09:29.778
I have her.

1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:39.955
I'm okay...

1:09:40.489 --> 1:09:43.125
She's hurt. But I have her.

1:09:44.659 --> 1:09:46.694
I've got you, Joan.

1:09:56.472 --> 1:09:57.907
He's dead.

1:09:59.874 --> 1:10:03.512
Well, now they can stuff him
and put him on display.

1:10:03.845 --> 1:10:05.680
You caused all this.

1:10:05.915 --> 1:10:08.250
Now you're gonna
get us out of here.

1:10:08.384 --> 1:10:09.584
Where's this fence?

1:10:09.717 --> 1:10:11.053
We'll climb it.

1:10:11.187 --> 1:10:12.587
Her head!

1:10:12.854 --> 1:10:13.923
Ahh...

1:10:14.656 --> 1:10:17.026
No!

1:10:19.761 --> 1:10:23.332
It won't kill you, but you
should get to a hospital soon.

1:10:26.035 --> 1:10:27.903
- Calm them down!
- I can't.

1:10:28.070 --> 1:10:30.406
I lost my tranquilizers
in the crash.

1:10:30.573 --> 1:10:31.773
Then cut them off!

1:10:33.409 --> 1:10:35.511
Aah!

1:10:35.578 --> 1:10:36.744
Go on!

1:10:37.980 --> 1:10:40.615
Jesus fucking mother of god!

1:10:40.748 --> 1:10:43.018
Fuck it, time to
shoot the bitch.

1:10:43.152 --> 1:10:44.353
No!

1:10:45.588 --> 1:10:47.890
Ow!

1:10:51.626 --> 1:10:53.795
Bad trip! Bad trip!

1:10:54.696 --> 1:10:56.098
Hah!

1:10:59.502 --> 1:11:00.802
C'mon.

1:11:17.286 --> 1:11:18.354
Wait!

1:11:18.888 --> 1:11:21.157
- Where is mariko?
- Who's that?

1:11:21.290 --> 1:11:22.410
The weird-looking pig thing.

1:11:22.491 --> 1:11:24.726
- It crawled into the cave.
- We gotta go back for her!

1:11:24.894 --> 1:11:27.329
- Those guys are there.
- But it's hiding in the rocks.

1:11:27.695 --> 1:11:29.331
C'mon! We gotta get out
of the zoo!

1:11:29.398 --> 1:11:30.398
No.

1:11:30.665 --> 1:11:32.134
I know what we'll do.

1:11:32.368 --> 1:11:34.069
We can ask the Luz mala.

1:11:34.170 --> 1:11:35.170
What?

1:11:35.271 --> 1:11:38.040
The lights. They can
mesmerize people. Cryptids, too.

1:11:38.174 --> 1:11:41.110
We can ask them to guide all
of the cryptids away from here,

1:11:41.243 --> 1:11:44.079
far away
from San Francisco to safety.

1:11:44.213 --> 1:11:46.382
The Luz mala are kept
in an auditorium.

1:11:46.515 --> 1:11:47.715
I know where it is.

1:11:47.849 --> 1:11:49.318
Take us there.

1:11:49.485 --> 1:11:50.852
Let me get that belt off.

1:11:50.986 --> 1:11:52.655
It's okay, I won't look at you.

1:11:52.754 --> 1:11:54.089
No! That never works.

1:11:54.223 --> 1:11:57.593
You'll glance at me and
you'll die. It always happens.

1:11:57.725 --> 1:11:58.826
Oh...

1:11:59.028 --> 1:11:59.761
Okay.

1:11:59.895 --> 1:12:02.164
Take my arm and I'll guide us.

1:12:02.298 --> 1:12:06.168
I know where we are.
I know how to get there, really.

1:12:06.302 --> 1:12:07.336
Trust me.

1:12:08.736 --> 1:12:10.172
<i>I love you.</i>

1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:19.548
Take a right at the next path.

1:12:19.682 --> 1:12:20.916
Right.

1:12:25.588 --> 1:12:27.423
You can't get up that way!

1:12:28.790 --> 1:12:31.026
You gotta come up to the top!

1:12:31.327 --> 1:12:33.262
Gloria's at the window!

1:12:34.363 --> 1:12:36.831
The camoodi's choking the tower!

1:12:37.266 --> 1:12:38.601
You'll be alright.

1:12:38.733 --> 1:12:40.269
We're almost there.

1:12:44.006 --> 1:12:45.007
Hurry!

1:12:45.307 --> 1:12:47.042
Vaughn! Joan!

1:12:47.209 --> 1:12:48.377
Argh!

1:12:48.577 --> 1:12:49.811
Ahh!

1:12:56.151 --> 1:12:57.151
Ahh!

1:13:11.667 --> 1:13:13.602
Buggers!

1:13:14.937 --> 1:13:16.138
Fucking gnomes are...

1:13:16.272 --> 1:13:19.575
Boss, help me here.

1:13:19.708 --> 1:13:20.743
Please!

1:13:20.875 --> 1:13:22.311
Where's the Baku?

1:13:22.678 --> 1:13:25.347
It went into the cave.

1:13:29.652 --> 1:13:31.420
Where are we now?

1:13:31.553 --> 1:13:33.455
The mermaid cove!

1:13:33.589 --> 1:13:35.391
We're almost there!

1:13:35.958 --> 1:13:38.894
Careful! Careful!

1:13:40.763 --> 1:13:43.365
- Luz mala?
- Yeah!

1:13:44.099 --> 1:13:45.934
The gate's closed.

1:13:46.235 --> 1:13:48.337
There's a switch in the booth.

1:13:54.276 --> 1:13:55.810
What the fuck!

1:13:56.278 --> 1:13:58.247
Oh... hi!

1:13:58.347 --> 1:13:59.348
Do you work here?

1:13:59.782 --> 1:14:01.216
<i>Who is it?</i>

1:14:01.383 --> 1:14:02.484
Stab her.

1:14:02.885 --> 1:14:05.087
Wait! We just wanna
open the gate!

1:14:05.287 --> 1:14:06.287
Who is it?

1:14:06.355 --> 1:14:09.024
There's a boy with a face
in his gut and

1:14:09.158 --> 1:14:10.858
a woman with a caged bird.

1:14:12.194 --> 1:14:15.964
Pliny? Pliny! It's me, Phoebe!

1:14:16.198 --> 1:14:17.198
It's okay.

1:14:17.299 --> 1:14:20.202
Whatever you're doing,
it doesn't matter right now.

1:14:20.336 --> 1:14:22.638
We're trying to get
to the lights.

1:14:22.771 --> 1:14:24.740
Don't listen
to that monster, baby.

1:14:24.872 --> 1:14:27.609
She's lying. They bought
and captured you.

1:14:27.710 --> 1:14:28.944
They want you in a cage.

1:14:29.244 --> 1:14:30.779
She doesn't care about you.

1:14:30.913 --> 1:14:31.947
None of them do.

1:14:32.247 --> 1:14:34.516
Please, pliny.
Remember the beautiful lights?

1:14:34.650 --> 1:14:37.453
- We just need to free them.
- Don't come any closer.

1:14:37.619 --> 1:14:40.456
You can leave if you want to.
We won't tell anyone.

1:14:40.556 --> 1:14:41.556
Stop her!

1:14:41.690 --> 1:14:44.093
If you are too chicken,
I'll do it.

1:14:44.460 --> 1:14:45.928
Give me the knife!

1:14:46.061 --> 1:14:47.529
Give me the knife!

1:14:47.796 --> 1:14:49.031
Pliny...

1:14:49.164 --> 1:14:49.965
Bad boy!

1:14:50.099 --> 1:14:52.267
You listen to your mother!
Bastard boy!

1:14:52.401 --> 1:14:53.635
Thanks, pliny!

1:14:54.269 --> 1:14:58.073
Yes!

1:15:17.893 --> 1:15:19.261
Joan!

1:15:24.366 --> 1:15:25.366
Joan?

1:15:26.735 --> 1:15:28.537
Are you here?

1:15:32.975 --> 1:15:34.309
Joan?

1:15:35.377 --> 1:15:37.079
Her lungs are weak.

1:15:37.579 --> 1:15:38.947
She's weak.

1:15:45.421 --> 1:15:46.622
Joan.

1:15:47.322 --> 1:15:48.590
Oh, Joan.

1:15:50.859 --> 1:15:52.661
You're gonna be okay...

1:15:53.061 --> 1:15:55.597
I failed Lauren.

1:15:56.532 --> 1:15:58.133
We failed them.

1:15:58.333 --> 1:16:01.570
We should've had
better security.

1:16:01.737 --> 1:16:03.605
- I shouldn't have...
- No, no.

1:16:03.939 --> 1:16:05.174
So trusting...

1:16:05.307 --> 1:16:07.843
You had a beautiful dream.

1:16:07.976 --> 1:16:10.412
And I believed in it.

1:16:10.546 --> 1:16:13.215
But it wasn't gonna last.

1:16:14.884 --> 1:16:18.454
Maybe now the cryptids
can go back into hiding.

1:16:18.587 --> 1:16:21.457
Maybe it's better this way.

1:16:22.257 --> 1:16:23.258
But...

1:16:23.859 --> 1:16:26.395
Who will take care of them?

1:16:26.930 --> 1:16:30.065
They can take care
of themselves, Joan.

1:16:31.567 --> 1:16:33.168
They always have.

1:16:34.236 --> 1:16:36.338
They want to be free.

1:16:36.906 --> 1:16:38.073
No...

1:16:38.207 --> 1:16:39.241
No!

1:16:40.609 --> 1:16:43.812
Maybe we needed them
more than they needed us.

1:16:43.979 --> 1:16:48.116
But I love them.

1:16:50.486 --> 1:16:52.254
I do too.

1:17:26.923 --> 1:17:29.057
Baku?

1:17:31.260 --> 1:17:33.262
Baku, where are you?

1:17:37.633 --> 1:17:38.800
Ah...

1:17:40.769 --> 1:17:42.471
Mariko, right?

1:17:45.173 --> 1:17:47.476
That's such a pretty name.

1:17:48.912 --> 1:17:51.446
But why do they think
you're a girl?

1:17:53.582 --> 1:17:55.484
Come home, little piggy.

1:17:56.351 --> 1:17:58.820
Ah! Fuck!

1:18:00.957 --> 1:18:02.824
Ah, ah!

1:18:03.859 --> 1:18:05.527
Jesus Christ!

1:18:06.061 --> 1:18:08.397
Fuck! Ah!

1:18:12.969 --> 1:18:14.670
Argh!

1:18:53.910 --> 1:18:55.410
Oh...

1:19:01.249 --> 1:19:02.551
Luz mala!

1:19:02.684 --> 1:19:03.685
Listen!

1:19:03.819 --> 1:19:05.687
The cryptozoo has fallen!

1:19:05.821 --> 1:19:09.092
Soldiers have come to capture
all the free cryptids!

1:19:09.157 --> 1:19:10.292
Or worse!

1:19:10.659 --> 1:19:12.127
Please, help us.

1:19:12.294 --> 1:19:15.597
Guide the cryptids out of here.
Away from the city.

1:19:15.731 --> 1:19:17.299
Back into hiding!

1:19:17.466 --> 1:19:19.568
They're so scared and confused!

1:19:19.701 --> 1:19:23.639
But you can Shepherd them
to safety!

1:19:32.882 --> 1:19:34.549
Do they get it?

1:19:35.952 --> 1:19:37.653
I think they get you.

1:19:46.261 --> 1:19:49.364
Glow blue if you understand!

1:19:55.804 --> 1:19:56.939
Far out.

1:19:58.941 --> 1:20:02.111
They can dig it. But they're
still trapped behind the glass.

1:20:02.244 --> 1:20:03.745
Can you break it?

1:20:03.879 --> 1:20:05.647
Yeah, let's fucking break it!

1:20:11.420 --> 1:20:13.221
If I turn pliny's mother
to stone,

1:20:13.355 --> 1:20:15.457
we can throw her at the glass!

1:20:16.324 --> 1:20:18.226
- Not even...
- Goddamnit!

1:20:18.427 --> 1:20:20.462
The glass is too thick.

1:20:20.997 --> 1:20:22.330
Wait.

1:20:23.032 --> 1:20:24.399
What?

1:20:30.039 --> 1:20:31.974
The horn of the unicorn.

1:20:34.743 --> 1:20:36.946
Okay, okay, okay.

1:20:38.780 --> 1:20:39.780
Ah!

1:21:03.705 --> 1:21:05.507
Yes!

1:21:09.078 --> 1:21:10.345
Ah yes!

1:21:13.883 --> 1:21:15.617
Where are you going?

1:21:15.817 --> 1:21:17.753
Ah! What's happening?

1:21:19.088 --> 1:21:20.522
Pliny!

1:21:21.623 --> 1:21:24.526
Bye-bye, mean lady!

1:22:32.094 --> 1:22:33.562
Joan...

1:23:11.234 --> 1:23:12.801
Mariko.

1:23:37.159 --> 1:23:38.693
Ugh!

1:23:51.274 --> 1:23:52.741
Huh?

1:24:23.772 --> 1:24:26.608
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust...

1:24:57.772 --> 1:25:01.077
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

1:26:34.370 --> 1:26:36.205
Don't worry,
she's gonna be fine.

1:26:39.408 --> 1:26:40.943
She's beautiful.

1:26:42.411 --> 1:26:43.745
Come here.

1:26:45.081 --> 1:26:46.348
Good girl.

1:26:49.885 --> 1:26:50.953
Thank you.

1:26:51.586 --> 1:26:52.586
Yeah.

1:26:53.122 --> 1:26:55.657
You take care
of yourself, Amber.

1:26:57.826 --> 1:26:59.328
C'mon, Mattie. Let's go.
