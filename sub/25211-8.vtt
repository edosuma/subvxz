01:41.300 --> 01:43.140
What are you doing?

01:47.373 --> 01:48.843
You must be freezing.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.224
Here.

02:00.252 --> 02:01.692
You should really
cover yourself up.

02:09.228 --> 02:10.948
Wouldn't want anyone
getting the wrong idea.

02:15.734 --> 02:16.904
Yeah, you're right.

02:20.272 --> 02:21.412
Let me help you.

02:33.852 --> 02:34.892
Come on.

02:35.854 --> 02:36.854
Come on.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.610
Come on, get in.

02:59.578 --> 03:00.548
I don't... I don't think
I should...

03:00.579 --> 03:02.479
Get in the fucking truck.

03:19.898 --> 03:23.808
Um... I should probably go.

03:23.836 --> 03:24.836
Go where?

03:26.405 --> 03:27.745
Um.

03:27.773 --> 03:29.813
No, I'm being serious.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.512
Zach, get off of me.

03:31.543 --> 03:33.243
Please, no.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.849
- Stop!
- Get off of me.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.620
Just relax, okay?

03:36.649 --> 03:38.289
Stop! Get off of her! Stop!

03:38.317 --> 03:39.987
No, no, no.

03:40.019 --> 03:42.459
- Please stop, please.
- Come on!

03:42.488 --> 03:44.288
- Jenna, Jenna, Jenna!
- No, no!

03:44.323 --> 03:45.893
Jenna!

03:45.924 --> 03:48.264
Clay, please help me.
He's hurting her! Please.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.434
Jenna, I just want
to make you feel good.

03:50.462 --> 03:51.832
Clay, unlock the truck!

03:51.864 --> 03:52.934
Calm down.

03:52.965 --> 03:55.805
Unlock the fucking truck!

03:55.834 --> 03:58.274
Jenna! Jenna, I'm here!

03:59.938 --> 04:03.038
Run.

04:03.075 --> 04:05.045
Run! Henry, go!

04:05.077 --> 04:06.717
Henry.

04:09.615 --> 04:11.355
Henry!

04:13.485 --> 04:15.485
Henry! Henry!

04:15.521 --> 04:16.551
Henry!

04:16.588 --> 04:17.558
Still in status.

04:17.589 --> 04:18.629
Known history.

04:18.656 --> 04:19.767
Seizing for over ten minutes.

04:19.791 --> 04:20.922
Push two CCs of Ativan.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.499
BP is dropping.

04:22.528 --> 04:23.558
99 over 52.

04:23.595 --> 04:24.695
Okay, sweetheart, I'm here.

04:24.730 --> 04:25.930
Come on, come on!

04:26.899 --> 04:28.369
Please, you have to wait here.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.640
Wait, but I...

04:29.668 --> 04:30.808
But I...

04:59.131 --> 05:01.531
What a fucking night?

05:01.567 --> 05:04.707
Help your brother
get to bed, would you?

05:13.579 --> 05:15.449
Lucas.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.621
No.

05:18.817 --> 05:21.617
Look, we'll call Cleo and
Thomas in the morning, okay?

05:21.653 --> 05:23.653
There's nothing we can do
about it right now.

05:23.689 --> 05:24.733
Just help your brother,
all right?

05:24.757 --> 05:26.027
Why don't you help him?

05:26.058 --> 05:27.798
Why don't you stop
fucking around?

05:27.826 --> 05:29.826
Okay? We got a big day tomorrow.

05:29.862 --> 05:31.802
No, we need to call it off.

05:31.830 --> 05:34.570
The meeting.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.800
Amos Miller didn't hurt Clay.

05:36.835 --> 05:37.805
Henry lied about
the whole thing.

05:37.836 --> 05:39.506
This shit again?

05:39.538 --> 05:41.049
She told me tonight
when we were upstairs.

05:41.073 --> 05:42.813
What do you mean?
Why would she say that?

05:42.841 --> 05:44.519
- Why would she lie?
- Why don't you ask him?

05:44.543 --> 05:46.613
Ask him what happened
the night of the accident.

05:46.645 --> 05:48.415
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

05:48.447 --> 05:49.791
- Hell, you don't know.
- Don't. Stop it, man.

05:49.815 --> 05:51.126
Henry came here
and she told Clay...

05:51.150 --> 05:52.590
- Lucas, don't!
- Why do you think...

05:52.618 --> 05:54.458
Why do you think
we have a broken window?

05:54.486 --> 05:55.697
- Hey, shut the fuck up!
- Because you fucking hurt her!

05:55.721 --> 05:56.765
You tried to fucking rape her!

05:56.789 --> 05:58.759
Hey, fuck you, Lucas!

05:58.791 --> 06:00.131
- What?
- I would never

06:00.159 --> 06:01.629
do that!
Dad, I would never do that.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.130
I tried to tell Lucas.
Henry's lying.

06:03.162 --> 06:04.439
- Yeah, I believe her.
- Hold on.

06:04.463 --> 06:05.863
You're my fucking brother!

06:05.898 --> 06:07.442
How could you believe
that bitch over me?

06:07.466 --> 06:08.943
Look, there is no reason
for us to get...

06:08.967 --> 06:10.545
God, stop acting like
a fucking victim, Clay.

06:10.569 --> 06:11.669
I'm so sick of it.

06:11.703 --> 06:13.403
You act like you
are untouchable!

06:13.439 --> 06:14.779
- Lucas...
- I am tired of

06:14.807 --> 06:15.777
cleaning up after your shit!

06:15.808 --> 06:16.808
I'm tired of cleaning up

06:16.842 --> 06:17.812
after everybody's shit!

06:17.843 --> 06:18.983
Stop it.

06:19.011 --> 06:20.581
You're tired. We all are.

06:20.612 --> 06:21.923
No, you told me... you told me
what I needed to do.

06:21.947 --> 06:23.191
You said, "Lucas, take care
of this family."

06:23.215 --> 06:24.793
Do what's right.
Do it for your brother."

06:24.817 --> 06:26.417
- Dad, what's he talking about?
- Stop.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.762
- But you were wrong.
- Stop it. Not here.

06:27.786 --> 06:29.431
You were wrong.
I shouldn't have done that.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.065
I shouldn't have listened
to a single fucking thing

06:31.089 --> 06:32.059
- that you ever fucking said to me!
- Stop it!

06:32.090 --> 06:33.590
None of it happened!

06:33.625 --> 06:35.385
What you said...
None of it fucking happened!

06:37.496 --> 06:39.636
Calm down. Now listen to me.

06:39.665 --> 06:40.865
Okay? Listen to me.

06:40.899 --> 06:42.939
Pop, I shouldn't have
ever done that.

06:44.203 --> 06:45.673
Go to your room.

06:45.704 --> 06:46.774
- Dad...
- Now!

06:58.550 --> 07:00.720
What you did was right.

07:00.752 --> 07:03.022
Yes, it was. Yes, it was.

07:03.055 --> 07:06.095
All right? Now you need
to cut this shit out.

07:06.124 --> 07:08.194
You're letting this girl
get inside your head.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.697
You don't need this right now.

07:09.728 --> 07:12.728
We don't need this right now.

07:12.764 --> 07:14.634
Now, let's get some rest

07:14.666 --> 07:16.566
and we can talk about it
in the morning, okay?

07:34.653 --> 07:36.097
Henrietta is
experiencing some kind of

07:36.121 --> 07:38.191
extended non-convulsive seizure.

07:38.223 --> 07:41.093
It's different than the
ones that she's had, and...

07:41.126 --> 07:43.866
Well, frankly, it's different than
anything I've ever seen before.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.139
Well, what does...
What does that mean?

07:45.163 --> 07:46.174
Most patients who experience

07:46.198 --> 07:47.268
non-convulsive seizures

07:47.299 --> 07:49.139
do so when they're awake,

07:49.167 --> 07:51.279
and some people don't even
realize that they're happening,

07:51.303 --> 07:54.173
but obviously,
Henrietta has been unconscious

07:54.206 --> 07:56.746
for several hours now,

07:56.775 --> 08:00.985
and that, in and of itself,
is a medical anomaly.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.813
But the good news is that
she's in stable condition,

08:03.849 --> 08:05.549
and there's no signs
of brain damage.

08:05.584 --> 08:07.584
Yeah, that... that is good news.

08:07.619 --> 08:09.119
Okay, well, what do we do now?

08:09.154 --> 08:10.932
I mean, what are you...
What are you gonna do?

08:10.956 --> 08:12.596
We're going to continue
to monitor her.

08:12.624 --> 08:14.594
Is she gonna wake up?

08:14.626 --> 08:16.966
She's gonna wake up, right?

08:18.096 --> 08:20.136
It's our sincere hope, yes.

08:20.165 --> 08:22.635
Well, how long
can she stay like this before...

08:22.668 --> 08:25.038
Right now, we want to just,
take things one step at a time.

08:25.070 --> 08:27.240
We're gonna continue
to run some tests

08:27.272 --> 08:29.317
and make sure that she
has everything that she needs,

08:29.341 --> 08:32.541
but the longer that she is in the
seizure, the higher the risk.

08:45.023 --> 08:46.063
Mom...

08:46.091 --> 08:47.191
Hi, honey. You hungry?

08:47.225 --> 08:48.825
No. Mom, listen.

08:48.860 --> 08:50.660
I need you to come with me,
okay?

08:50.696 --> 08:52.206
Jenna needs us.
She's been attacked, okay?

08:52.230 --> 08:53.975
- She needs our help.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart,

08:53.999 --> 08:55.899
but I'm stuck here.

08:55.934 --> 08:58.134
Besides, we're gonna have
dinner together as a family.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.210
Mom, Jenna needs us.

09:00.238 --> 09:02.278
Steve's making us lasagna.

09:02.307 --> 09:05.147
Crispy edges,
just the way you like it.

09:05.177 --> 09:08.247
Isn't he the greatest?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.280
- What the fuck?
- Hey, hey, hey.

09:10.315 --> 09:12.115
Not in front of the big guy.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.270
Don't you just love it here?

09:16.321 --> 09:19.191
Phil?

09:19.224 --> 09:21.294
Mom, I... I don't...
I don't understand.

09:21.326 --> 09:22.696
- What's going on?
- Hey, Henry?

09:22.728 --> 09:25.168
Hello?

09:25.197 --> 09:26.207
While you're up, fetch me
another beer, would you?

09:26.231 --> 09:28.131
I'll get you one.

09:28.166 --> 09:30.636
Mom...

09:30.669 --> 09:32.009
You promised me

09:32.037 --> 09:33.214
that you were done with
this asshole.

09:33.238 --> 09:34.708
I know,

09:34.740 --> 09:35.917
but give him another shot,
for me.

09:35.941 --> 09:37.611
No.

09:37.643 --> 09:40.013
I need you to snap the fuck
out of this shit.

09:40.045 --> 09:43.185
This is not fair to me.
I need you.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.255
Don't be so mean to your mother.

09:45.283 --> 09:46.853
She's doing the best she can.

09:49.254 --> 09:50.694
Thomas...

09:50.722 --> 09:51.992
Thomas! Thomas!

09:52.024 --> 09:53.664
Can you listen to me?
Jenna is in trouble.

09:53.692 --> 09:54.832
She needs our help.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.230
Okay? Zach is trying to...

09:57.262 --> 09:58.640
I think... I think
he's gonna rape her,

09:58.664 --> 10:00.004
so I...

10:00.032 --> 10:02.702
- I can't.
- She's your daughter!

10:02.734 --> 10:04.245
Yeah, but I have to stay here
with your mom now.

10:04.269 --> 10:05.309
She's gonna leave me soon.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.273
Hey, gang.

10:09.307 --> 10:11.047
I brought wine.

10:16.081 --> 10:17.281
That's so sweet of you, Bill.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.324
I'm... I-I don't...

10:21.353 --> 10:22.997
Henrietta, why don't
you go up to your room

10:23.021 --> 10:25.091
so your mom and I
can have some privacy?

10:25.123 --> 10:27.293
Yes, sweetheart, listen to Bill.

10:27.325 --> 10:29.895
Don't you always
end up there anyway?

10:41.973 --> 10:44.173
Hi.

10:44.209 --> 10:45.249
You're...

10:45.277 --> 10:46.877
You.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.080
What are you...

10:51.116 --> 10:52.186
Get off my bed.

10:52.217 --> 10:53.917
It's my bed, too.

10:59.357 --> 11:00.957
Do you hear that?

11:00.992 --> 11:02.932
It's close.

11:02.961 --> 11:04.001
What is?

11:04.029 --> 11:05.029
Monster.

11:05.063 --> 11:07.103
I have to hide.

11:09.968 --> 11:11.308
Wait!

11:21.246 --> 11:23.046
What the fuck?

12:02.487 --> 12:03.957
Hello?

12:05.123 --> 12:06.293
Hello?

12:37.522 --> 12:38.822
Hey.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.996
You get any rest?

12:47.032 --> 12:49.232
A little.

12:51.136 --> 12:54.306
You know, family shouldn't
talk to family that way.

12:54.339 --> 12:56.409
- Tell that to Lucas.
- Well, I'm telling it

12:56.441 --> 13:00.181
to you right now.

13:00.212 --> 13:02.482
Look...

13:09.487 --> 13:12.187
You know, you boys
are all that I've got.

13:15.126 --> 13:18.426
This is not the life
that I wanted for you.

13:18.463 --> 13:22.573
I know it's not the life
that you wanted for yourself,

13:22.601 --> 13:24.541
and that's on me.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.312
That's on me, you understand?

13:30.408 --> 13:33.308
I'm sorry, son.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.045
I am so sorry.

13:41.486 --> 13:43.386
Why are you saying that?

13:45.991 --> 13:48.291
Because a man
oughta own up to his mistakes.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.299
If for nothing else,
then because it'll

13:52.330 --> 13:55.230
eat you up from the inside
if you don't.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.111
It's just one of those things
you start to understand

13:57.135 --> 13:59.975
when you get older.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.905
My father used to tell it to me
all the time,

14:01.940 --> 14:03.840
but I was too stubborn
to listen.

14:06.645 --> 14:10.145
I'm hoping it's not gonna be
the same way for you.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.990
I need to know
what happened that night.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.096
Between you and Henrietta.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.497
Dad, I already told you.

14:24.529 --> 14:27.169
Clay, this is just you and me
right now.

14:27.198 --> 14:29.338
Okay?

14:29.367 --> 14:30.637
I don't remember.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.009
I don't remember a lot.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.519
We were making out,

14:43.548 --> 14:45.518
and...

14:45.550 --> 14:47.890
I guess...

14:49.988 --> 14:52.688
I mean, she wanted it.

14:52.724 --> 14:54.694
I know she did.

14:54.726 --> 14:57.266
I know when a girl...

14:57.295 --> 14:58.465
You know?

15:02.267 --> 15:03.567
I mean, I thought she wanted it.

15:03.601 --> 15:05.201
You thought she wanted it?

15:05.236 --> 15:08.406
Yeah, she seemed into it.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.440
Is there a chance
that she wasn't?

15:12.477 --> 15:14.147
How am I supposed to know
what's going on

15:14.179 --> 15:15.519
in someone else's head?

15:15.547 --> 15:17.587
Did she put up a fight?
Did she say no?

15:30.295 --> 15:32.095
I don't know.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.140
I don't know anymore.

15:39.704 --> 15:42.044
Maybe she tried to say no.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.500
Okay.

16:11.736 --> 16:12.736
Hey...

16:14.672 --> 16:17.242
You made a mistake.
That's all it was.

16:22.781 --> 16:24.251
Look...

16:25.617 --> 16:27.417
This stays here.

16:27.452 --> 16:29.192
You understand?

16:29.220 --> 16:30.790
What you just told me,

16:30.822 --> 16:35.432
you can never say
to anyone else.

16:35.460 --> 16:36.560
What about Lucas?

16:36.594 --> 16:38.994
I'll talk to him.

16:41.266 --> 16:42.706
That was...

16:42.734 --> 16:44.704
It was just a mistake
that you made.

16:44.736 --> 16:47.236
Son, it doesn't have
to define you.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.712
I'm gonna take care of it.

16:52.744 --> 16:54.184
I'm gonna do everything I can

16:54.212 --> 16:55.782
to protect you, okay?

17:00.351 --> 17:01.491
I told you...

17:04.455 --> 17:06.425
You boys are everything to me.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.555
Ma'am.

17:35.587 --> 17:36.757
Sorry.

17:52.504 --> 17:53.544
Sorry.

18:01.813 --> 18:04.553
I can get you a bottle of water,

18:04.582 --> 18:07.552
if you want. There's a
machine down the hall.

18:07.585 --> 18:10.825
A cigarette would be better,

18:10.855 --> 18:12.155
but thank you.

18:17.228 --> 18:19.398
You know, when I was
pregnant with her,

18:19.430 --> 18:21.670
I thought,

18:21.699 --> 18:23.339
"This kid's
gonna change my life,"

18:23.368 --> 18:27.538
but I had no idea how.

18:27.572 --> 18:30.272
And she was always
a little pistol,

18:30.308 --> 18:33.208
right out of the gate. I mean...

18:33.244 --> 18:37.514
She never made anything easy.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.449
But I love her for it, I do.

18:40.485 --> 18:44.355
I can never tell her that,
of course.

18:44.389 --> 18:46.289
But...

18:46.324 --> 18:48.394
I'm so proud of her.

18:48.426 --> 18:51.326
For being...

18:51.362 --> 18:52.732
She's so stubborn.

18:52.764 --> 18:54.241
I mean, stubborn
as all get out, right?

18:54.265 --> 18:55.509
But that's what's gonna make her

18:55.533 --> 18:57.703
this interesting,
powerful woman.

19:00.705 --> 19:02.305
I just...

19:02.340 --> 19:04.280
I had no idea, I mean no idea,

19:04.309 --> 19:05.879
how much I was missing.

19:08.813 --> 19:10.783
I know her,

19:10.815 --> 19:12.685
and I knew something
wasn't right.

19:15.553 --> 19:19.453
I pushed so much shit on her.

19:19.490 --> 19:22.430
But I just...

19:22.460 --> 19:25.230
I wanted her to be
happy for me, you know?

19:25.263 --> 19:27.463
And so everything
that she did or she said

19:27.498 --> 19:29.238
that I should've questioned,

19:29.267 --> 19:32.807
I just let it go,

19:32.837 --> 19:34.907
but I should've pushed.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.247
She was trying to tell me,
you know?

19:39.811 --> 19:41.381
And I didn't listen.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.222
Does she talk to you about Clay?

19:51.556 --> 19:52.656
I don't...

19:52.690 --> 19:54.660
I don't know what...

19:54.692 --> 19:57.362
She told me
right before all this.

19:57.395 --> 20:00.265
She told me he hurt her.

20:00.298 --> 20:02.438
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

20:04.035 --> 20:07.675
Jenna, if you know something,
please...

20:07.705 --> 20:09.605
I need you to talk to me.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.382
I don't... I don't know a lot.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.250
I...

20:14.279 --> 20:15.849
I was just home, you know,

20:15.880 --> 20:17.920
when she got back.

20:17.949 --> 20:19.860
She never would've
said anything to me otherwise.

20:19.884 --> 20:22.324
When she got back from where?

20:22.353 --> 20:24.553
It was the night
of Clay's accident.

20:24.589 --> 20:26.559
She was... upset.

20:26.591 --> 20:31.261
Like, it's hard to tell
when Henry is upset, but...

20:31.296 --> 20:33.936
Did she tell you what happened?

20:33.965 --> 20:35.635
No, not completely.

20:38.069 --> 20:40.339
Did he...

20:40.371 --> 20:41.841
Did he rape her?

20:46.844 --> 20:48.344
I think he tried.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.383
My God.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.288
- My God.
- I'm sorry.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.920
I tried to convince her
to talk to you,

20:56.954 --> 21:01.524
but you know Henry's... Henry.

21:03.828 --> 21:07.028
But I... I think something happened
with Clay's dad after that.

21:08.866 --> 21:11.066
With Bill? What do you mean?

21:11.102 --> 21:13.602
I know that she's scared of him.

21:13.638 --> 21:14.608
Why?

21:14.639 --> 21:16.539
She didn't say, but...

21:16.574 --> 21:19.744
it's... it's all of them.

21:19.777 --> 21:21.717
Henry's afraid of
all of the Boones.

21:32.023 --> 21:33.363
Hello?

21:43.601 --> 21:45.841
Why'd you do this?

21:45.870 --> 21:47.440
He didn't do anything wrong.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.572
I di... I didn't. I...

21:48.606 --> 21:51.946
You killed him.

21:51.976 --> 21:54.416
You killed him.

21:54.445 --> 21:56.445
It's your fault!

22:01.652 --> 22:03.122
Shit. Fuck!

22:11.596 --> 22:13.666
Okay.

22:13.698 --> 22:14.798
Hold on.

22:14.832 --> 22:16.372
Hold on, just... just one second.

22:16.401 --> 22:20.041
Out of breath.

22:20.071 --> 22:21.941
- Townes?
- Hello.

22:21.973 --> 22:23.843
Jesus, you scared the shit
out of me.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.515
My glasses

22:25.543 --> 22:26.913
are too big to fit under this,

22:26.944 --> 22:29.944
so... It's really heavy.

22:29.981 --> 22:31.851
Yeah, why are you wearing that?

22:31.883 --> 22:33.483
This is my costume.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.028
You should really think about
getting one.

22:35.052 --> 22:36.492
All superheroes need them

22:36.521 --> 22:37.921
to keep their identity a secret.

22:37.955 --> 22:41.525
I'm not a s...

22:41.559 --> 22:44.459
I'm not a superhero.

22:45.696 --> 22:47.866
Look, I need your help
with something.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.139
Like... like...

22:49.167 --> 22:51.837
Like, as a... as a friend?

22:51.869 --> 22:54.169
Yeah, sure.

22:54.205 --> 22:57.175
Have you seen a little girl
anywhere?

22:57.208 --> 22:59.808
What do you mean?

22:59.844 --> 23:01.514
I don't know.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.786
She was in my bedroom, and...

23:02.814 --> 23:04.684
And then she was just gone,
and...

23:04.715 --> 23:06.855
She said there's a monster,

23:06.884 --> 23:08.684
and I think it's trying to
hurt her.

23:10.955 --> 23:12.955
And I'm pretty sure
that she's me.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.430
Like, when I was a kid.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.630
I think I'm supposed to
protect her.

23:18.663 --> 23:19.833
Why are you smiling?

23:21.098 --> 23:23.668
Because this is
your hero's journey,

23:23.701 --> 23:25.001
to rescue the little girl.

23:25.036 --> 23:26.606
Don't you see?

23:26.637 --> 23:28.877
That's why you're here.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.748
You'll need this.

23:36.013 --> 23:37.753
Come on, take it.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.600
Let's go.

24:09.547 --> 24:10.817
Come on.

24:29.233 --> 24:31.873
I thought we were clear, Deputy.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.103
Got a lot of shit on my plate.

24:34.138 --> 24:36.838
Jeremiah Miller and the Boones

24:36.874 --> 24:39.144
are gonna be
at the dealership today.

24:39.176 --> 24:40.876
Could be an exchange.

24:44.015 --> 24:46.115
How do you know this?

24:48.252 --> 24:49.852
I have a source.

24:51.255 --> 24:53.125
Okay.

24:54.592 --> 24:57.292
Really? That's all
you're gonna give me?

24:57.328 --> 24:58.898
It's a chance to arrest
the Mennonites

24:58.930 --> 25:01.930
and the Boones on U.S. soil.

25:01.966 --> 25:03.636
It seems like enough.

25:03.668 --> 25:07.168
I don't trust
perfectly wrapped gifts.

25:07.204 --> 25:10.104
There's always a catch.

25:10.141 --> 25:11.841
Look, I have reason to believe

25:11.876 --> 25:13.746
that Lucas Boone
killed Amos Miller.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.718
I want to make sure
he's held accountable.

25:20.651 --> 25:23.851
You regret it, don't you?

25:23.888 --> 25:25.599
Defending your partner
for shooting that kid?

25:25.623 --> 25:27.063
Where do you get off?

25:27.091 --> 25:29.891
Just a question.

25:29.927 --> 25:31.127
I didn't see what happened.

25:31.162 --> 25:33.162
Yeah, but you knew.

25:33.197 --> 25:35.267
White cop, black kid, unarmed.

25:35.299 --> 25:36.599
Three bullets in the back.

25:36.634 --> 25:37.834
Look, it ain't rocket science.

25:37.868 --> 25:38.968
Okay, this does not have

25:39.003 --> 25:40.143
anything to do with that.

25:40.171 --> 25:41.211
I ain't judging.

25:48.346 --> 25:51.016
Look, if we get ours,

25:51.048 --> 25:52.648
you'll be a step closer
to getting yours,

25:52.683 --> 25:54.353
but you know how it works.

25:54.385 --> 25:56.325
You want Lucas Boone,

25:56.354 --> 25:58.254
you build a case.

26:01.158 --> 26:02.328
We'll be in touch.

26:10.901 --> 26:12.141
Asshole.

26:25.116 --> 26:28.156
Lord, we reach out
to you in our time of crisis.

26:29.387 --> 26:31.357
We ask that you protect us,

26:31.389 --> 26:34.389
and wash away our sins.

26:34.425 --> 26:36.325
Grant us the strength

26:36.360 --> 26:37.960
to face our enemies

26:37.995 --> 26:40.695
with compassion
and understanding.

26:40.731 --> 26:42.371
Be our shield

26:42.400 --> 26:44.840
against evil.

26:44.869 --> 26:48.409
For your divine justice,
we pray.

26:48.439 --> 26:49.809
Amen.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.040
Amen.

27:10.695 --> 27:15.135
If you wish peace,
prepare for war.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.666
We would be foolish
to travel blindly.

27:26.010 --> 27:27.350
Come home.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.320
You as well.

28:11.455 --> 28:13.025
- Townes...
- I just saw your dad

28:13.057 --> 28:15.927
walking around outside
in the cold.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.200
Yeah, he's...

28:17.228 --> 28:18.998
He's not really
a big fan of hospitals

28:19.029 --> 28:20.769
with my mom and everything.

28:22.399 --> 28:24.139
Should I have brought marijuana?

28:24.168 --> 28:25.508
- What?
- It's polite

28:25.536 --> 28:27.247
to bring a sympathy gift
when someone's sick,

28:27.271 --> 28:28.871
and the only thing
I know Henry likes

28:28.906 --> 28:29.946
is marijuana.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.344
I... I'm sure it'll be okay.

28:31.375 --> 28:32.815
- Look...
- I was thinking.

28:32.843 --> 28:35.783
What if she's in
some kind of power coma?

28:41.085 --> 28:43.185
Like, a coma resulting from
a malfunction

28:43.220 --> 28:45.360
of Henry's teleportation powers?

28:45.389 --> 28:47.059
Yeah, I don't know,

28:47.091 --> 28:48.368
but I think that we should
tell them the truth.

28:48.392 --> 28:49.432
Who?

28:50.895 --> 28:53.165
Cleo, my dad, the doctors...

28:53.197 --> 28:55.137
And reveal Henry's powers?

28:55.166 --> 28:56.766
No, definitely not.

28:56.801 --> 28:58.301
- But...
- No, that's rule number one.

28:58.335 --> 28:59.805
We never do that.

28:59.837 --> 29:01.377
She's sick. I hate more than...

29:01.405 --> 29:02.875
Jenna, you're not used to people

29:02.907 --> 29:04.077
looking at you strangely,

29:04.108 --> 29:06.208
but they will.

29:06.243 --> 29:07.883
No one will believe us,
and if they do,

29:07.912 --> 29:09.282
they'll probably call
the military

29:09.313 --> 29:10.913
and lock Henry up
in some compound

29:10.948 --> 29:12.359
and do tests on her
like she's a lab rat,

29:12.383 --> 29:15.253
like... like in
"Flight of the Navigator."

29:15.286 --> 29:16.956
No.

29:16.987 --> 29:20.797
The last thing Henry needs
is a betrayal of friendship.

29:20.825 --> 29:23.525
We can figure this out
on our own.

29:25.262 --> 29:26.362
Okay.

29:31.335 --> 29:33.805
What about her dad?

29:33.838 --> 29:36.583
We could try to find him. I mean,
she... she teleported to that house.

29:36.607 --> 29:38.807
And for all we know,
teleportation...

29:38.843 --> 29:41.413
Could be genetic.

29:41.445 --> 29:43.885
Okay, I can go through
Cleo's things at the house,

29:43.914 --> 29:46.084
see what I can find.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.271
Your hands are so dry.

30:09.273 --> 30:13.013
Put some lotion on them.

30:34.331 --> 30:36.209
Um, excuse me? Can someone
come in here, please?

30:36.233 --> 30:37.433
I think something's happening.

30:42.273 --> 30:43.943
Heart rate's increasing.

30:43.974 --> 30:45.344
Sweetheart, fight!

30:45.376 --> 30:47.346
Come on,

30:47.378 --> 30:48.448
fight.

30:59.623 --> 31:01.163
All right.

31:01.191 --> 31:03.131
- Let's go.
- I can't.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.160
This is the threshold.

31:05.195 --> 31:06.535
You need to cross it yourself.

31:06.563 --> 31:08.633
Townes, I told you
I needed your help.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.536
Why can't you just... -
'Cause you're the hero, Henry.

31:11.568 --> 31:14.408
Only you can save the little
girl from the monster.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.578
But what if I can't?

31:35.259 --> 31:38.629
It's you.

31:38.662 --> 31:42.502
Don't touch her.

31:42.533 --> 31:44.473
She didn't do anything wrong.

31:46.704 --> 31:48.704
You sure about that?

31:48.739 --> 31:50.639
Stop!

31:53.210 --> 31:56.110
Please, please, just leave her alone.
Please.

31:57.614 --> 31:59.614
You're not the only one
who's special, Henry Coles.

32:09.326 --> 32:10.966
It's okay, it's okay.

32:10.995 --> 32:12.295
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

32:23.607 --> 32:25.251
- Shit, what's happening?
- Get the doctor.

32:25.275 --> 32:27.345
Henry, I'm here. I'm right here.

32:27.378 --> 32:28.678
My God!

32:28.712 --> 32:30.412
- Shit!
- Airway's tightened.

32:30.447 --> 32:31.524
Okay, five milligrams
of midazolam.

32:31.548 --> 32:32.518
Step back, ma'am.

32:32.549 --> 32:34.389
Please, step back.

32:34.418 --> 32:37.718
- My God!
- Get her some oxygen.

32:37.755 --> 32:39.532
- I've lost the lead!
- I'm trying to reach it.

32:39.556 --> 32:41.556
Henry, Henry, wake up!
Please wake up!

32:58.075 --> 33:01.515
Henry...

33:04.181 --> 33:06.121
Henry! Henry!

33:06.150 --> 33:08.720
Henrietta! Ho, ho, ho!

33:08.752 --> 33:10.792
- I've got ya. Argh!
- Dad?

33:10.821 --> 33:12.621
I'm gonna get you, bucko!

33:12.656 --> 33:15.026
You can't. You're too slow.

33:15.059 --> 33:16.329
- Too slow?
- Why, I'm

33:16.360 --> 33:20.060
the fastest pirate
in all the land!

33:22.566 --> 33:27.076
What's your move, lassie?

33:27.104 --> 33:28.744
You got me.

33:28.772 --> 33:30.672
I've been struck down

33:30.707 --> 33:32.147
by young pirate Hank,

33:32.176 --> 33:33.346
the strongest pirate

33:33.377 --> 33:35.717
I ever did see.

33:35.746 --> 33:37.186
Wake up! Wake up!

33:37.214 --> 33:39.514
Okay, I'm awake, I'm awake.

33:39.550 --> 33:42.820
Matey. I'm awake, Hank.
Awake, Hank.

33:47.157 --> 33:49.427
The monster's back.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.660
Remember?

33:51.695 --> 33:52.835
What do you mean?

33:57.301 --> 33:59.841
Henry...

33:59.870 --> 34:01.170
Come on, come on!

34:01.205 --> 34:02.335
- Dad, stop...
- Come on!

34:02.372 --> 34:03.642
Come on!

34:03.674 --> 34:04.851
- Come on, it's okay.
- Please...

34:04.875 --> 34:06.445
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

34:06.477 --> 34:08.077
Shh.

34:08.112 --> 34:10.612
Be quiet and stay here.

34:18.789 --> 34:20.089
Please, don't do this.

34:20.123 --> 34:21.594
I can help you. Just...

34:21.625 --> 34:23.665
Give me a chance.

34:32.268 --> 34:33.839
Please! Please!

34:41.712 --> 34:44.812
It's not good enough. There's got
to be something more you can do.

34:44.848 --> 34:46.547
Just because the medication
didn't take

34:46.583 --> 34:48.453
doesn't mean I've given up.

34:48.485 --> 34:49.725
She's stable, for now,

34:49.753 --> 34:50.723
and I've got calls in

34:50.754 --> 34:52.524
to a number of specialists.

34:52.556 --> 34:53.766
In the meantime, we are gonna
monitor her condition...

34:53.790 --> 34:55.630
You're gonna monitor
her condition?

34:55.659 --> 34:57.270
- We're going to keep her comfortable.
- Yeah, okay.

34:57.294 --> 34:58.564
I'm sorry.

34:58.595 --> 34:59.695
Yeah.

34:59.730 --> 35:00.773
I wish I had better news
for you.

35:00.797 --> 35:03.167
Me too.

35:08.872 --> 35:10.342
You know, darling, she's strong.

35:10.374 --> 35:11.718
She's a fighter.
She'll pull through this.

35:11.742 --> 35:12.886
- Please don't. Just...
- Hey...

35:12.910 --> 35:15.150
Please don't. Just don't.

35:20.317 --> 35:23.257
I just can't stand here anymore!

35:23.287 --> 35:24.831
What are you... what are you...
Whoa, where are you going?

35:24.855 --> 35:26.299
- What do you... what is wrong?
- She needed me,

35:26.323 --> 35:28.593
and I did nothing.
I did nothing.

35:28.625 --> 35:29.725
I have to go.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.790
- Cleo...
- I have to go.

35:30.827 --> 35:33.667
Just call me if she wakes up.

35:35.632 --> 35:37.802
I-I'm telling you, Pop,
I just... I have this feeling

35:37.834 --> 35:38.904
like they know.

35:38.936 --> 35:40.806
Okay, they... they...

35:40.837 --> 35:42.949
- Look, they know it was me!
- The Millers don't know shit.

35:42.973 --> 35:44.943
I told you they think
it was an overdose.

35:44.975 --> 35:46.945
Yeah, of course
they're gonna tell you that!

35:46.977 --> 35:48.354
Do you really think
that I would ever

35:48.378 --> 35:50.218
put you in harm's way?

35:58.689 --> 36:01.259
- Of course not.
- No, no.

36:01.291 --> 36:03.391
No.

36:03.427 --> 36:04.671
I told you,
I got this thing handled.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.595
I just need you to trust me.

36:06.630 --> 36:08.730
You do trust me, don't you?

36:11.735 --> 36:12.875
- Good.
- Yeah.

36:12.903 --> 36:14.943
Good.

36:14.972 --> 36:17.612
Look, I spoke to Clay.

36:17.641 --> 36:18.881
They way I see it,

36:18.909 --> 36:20.349
Henrietta told Clay she hurt him

36:20.377 --> 36:22.377
because she wishes she had.

36:22.412 --> 36:26.422
Just a broken girl's way
of causing chaos.

36:26.450 --> 36:27.750
Makes a hell of a lot more sense

36:27.784 --> 36:28.895
than some girl
crushing your brother

36:28.919 --> 36:31.519
with her super strength, right?

36:31.555 --> 36:32.932
- Yeah.
- I mean, you saw her at dinner.

36:32.956 --> 36:34.596
Jesus Christ.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.365
She's as handicapped as Clay is.

36:36.393 --> 36:38.533
Yeah, right. Yeah.

36:38.562 --> 36:41.662
Heh. All right, now look.

36:41.698 --> 36:42.938
Pull yourself together

36:42.966 --> 36:44.666
and meet me and the guys
at the shop.

36:44.701 --> 36:45.878
The Millers will be here soon.

36:45.902 --> 36:48.802
- Okay?
- Okay.

36:48.839 --> 36:50.539
And do me a favor.

36:50.574 --> 36:51.944
Stop treating Clay like shit.

36:51.975 --> 36:53.575
He's been punished enough.

37:48.699 --> 37:50.669
This is Cleo. Leave a message.

37:50.701 --> 37:53.941
Cleo, it's Anna.

37:53.970 --> 37:56.910
Look, I... I shouldn't have
lied to you the other night,

37:56.940 --> 37:59.940
but there's something
you should know.

37:59.976 --> 38:03.846
It's not safe for you
to go to work today.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.750
Stay away from Boone Motors.

38:06.783 --> 38:08.923
Look, I wish I... I could
tell you more, but I can't.

38:08.952 --> 38:10.952
Just...

38:10.987 --> 38:12.527
Can you just call me back?

38:12.556 --> 38:14.396
Okay.

38:42.419 --> 38:43.389
Bill?

38:43.420 --> 38:44.760
Cleo.

38:44.788 --> 38:46.528
- Hey, is Henry okay?
- Where is he?

38:46.556 --> 38:47.734
Where's your father?
I need to talk to him.

38:47.758 --> 38:48.835
Okay, he's...
He's busy right now.

38:48.859 --> 38:51.629
Look, you... you cannot be here.

38:51.661 --> 38:53.931
Listen, this is really
not a good time right now.

38:53.964 --> 38:56.004
I know what Clay did
to my daughter.

38:58.168 --> 39:00.838
Did you know, Lucas?

39:00.871 --> 39:02.511
- Did you all know?
- No.

39:02.539 --> 39:03.983
Is that why he hired me?
To make nice?

39:04.007 --> 39:05.547
No, no... I mean, I don't know.

39:05.575 --> 39:07.675
I... I don't know.

39:07.711 --> 39:09.756
- He said something to her. I know he did.
- Okay, listen to me.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.057
I get it, I do,
but we just can't

39:11.081 --> 39:12.158
talk about this
right here, okay?

39:12.182 --> 39:13.682
You need to get home.

39:13.717 --> 39:15.817
Listen, it is not safe here.

39:15.852 --> 39:16.992
Cleo! Cleo!

39:17.020 --> 39:18.990
Get your fucking hands off me.

39:19.022 --> 39:20.762
D... just wait.

39:52.456 --> 39:53.996
Henry.

40:04.468 --> 40:05.938
Hi.

40:14.010 --> 40:15.150
Put the knife down.

40:15.178 --> 40:16.778
Get the fuck out of my house.

40:16.813 --> 40:17.883
Okay, whoa.

40:17.914 --> 40:20.554
Hold on, I get it.

40:20.584 --> 40:21.654
I get how this looks.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.155
Of course you're scared,

40:23.186 --> 40:25.226
but I think

40:25.255 --> 40:26.625
we can help each other.

40:26.656 --> 40:29.956
See, I'm not here for you.

40:29.993 --> 40:32.533
I'm looking for Henrietta Coles.

41:03.093 --> 41:05.893
Thought you'd end up back here.

41:05.929 --> 41:08.599
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

41:10.734 --> 41:13.574
Where'd that come from?

41:13.603 --> 41:16.003
Get out of my room.

41:17.274 --> 41:18.774
I'm not gonna do that.

41:18.808 --> 41:21.578
Get out!
Get out of my fucking head!

41:21.611 --> 41:22.911
Get out!

41:22.946 --> 41:24.516
Get out!

41:24.548 --> 41:25.578
Say you're sorry!

41:25.615 --> 41:26.985
Nope.

41:27.017 --> 41:27.987
Say it!

41:28.018 --> 41:29.918
Say you're fucking sorry!

41:29.953 --> 41:32.153
- Say it!
- Nope.

41:32.188 --> 41:33.788
No, you heard...

41:33.823 --> 41:34.893
You have to say it!

41:34.925 --> 41:36.565
You have to say you're sorry!

41:36.593 --> 41:38.033
Just admit what you did.

41:38.061 --> 41:40.201
Just admit what you did to me,
please.

41:40.230 --> 41:41.600
Just tell the fucking truth.

41:41.631 --> 41:42.971
Just say it.

41:42.999 --> 41:44.169
No.

41:58.248 --> 42:01.188
Please. Please.

42:02.786 --> 42:04.226
No.

42:13.096 --> 42:16.596
Please.

42:19.035 --> 42:21.805
Please.

42:21.838 --> 42:23.778
Stop.

42:30.213 --> 42:33.153
I c-can't.

42:33.183 --> 42:35.153
I can't.

42:35.185 --> 42:37.755
Yes, you can.

42:37.787 --> 42:41.357
If I do that, then
he'll get away with everything.

42:41.391 --> 42:45.801
With everything
that he did to us.

42:45.829 --> 42:47.169
You told me to kill the monster.

42:47.197 --> 42:49.297
I'm killing the monster.
I'm doing it.

42:49.332 --> 42:52.702
But he's not the monster.

43:04.414 --> 43:05.884
I didn't...

43:08.385 --> 43:11.155
I d... I didn't...

43:11.187 --> 43:14.757
I mean, I thought that
I was protecting us.

43:20.263 --> 43:22.663
Please.

43:52.862 --> 43:53.932
Shit.

44:01.805 --> 44:04.145
Stay calm, all right?

44:04.174 --> 44:06.214
You just give me the knife

44:06.242 --> 44:08.412
and everything's gonna be okay.

44:08.445 --> 44:12.185
Just give me the knife.

44:12.215 --> 44:13.755
Leave her alone!

44:13.783 --> 44:15.453
Leave her the fuck alone!

44:18.822 --> 44:21.062
Henrietta Coles.

44:22.158 --> 44:24.328
You.

44:24.360 --> 44:27.300
Listen...

44:27.330 --> 44:29.700
I know

44:29.733 --> 44:31.233
a lot about you.

44:33.737 --> 44:36.277
I know what you can do.

44:36.306 --> 44:39.076
Probably more than
you know yourself.

44:42.912 --> 44:45.412
It always starts with seizures.

44:49.018 --> 44:51.718
You took my dad.
