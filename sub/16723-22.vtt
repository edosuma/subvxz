WEBVTT

00:03.783 --> 00:06.920
I am in the midst of negotiations

00:06.921 --> 00:10.490
to sell Wonder Wharf
and build... high-end condos.

00:10.525 --> 00:12.192
What does Mr. Fischoeder say
about that?

00:14.262 --> 00:16.096
You work on him, convince him to sell.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.367
"Carousel no longer in service"?

00:20.368 --> 00:22.369
"Newer, better, less boring
ride coming soon"?

00:22.403 --> 00:26.039
♪ I know you're already
a wealthy-ish guy ♪

00:26.040 --> 00:30.277
♪ But think of what
that condo money could buy ♪

00:30.278 --> 00:34.347
♪ And I'd open up Bob's
Beach Burgers and Fries... ♪

00:34.382 --> 00:37.017
That's how you lock your sister to
a wooden horse. Yeah.

00:37.051 --> 00:40.620
I'm not ever selling this wharf!

00:40.655 --> 00:41.922
What?!

00:41.956 --> 00:43.557
Hey, have you ever pooped out a key?

00:43.558 --> 00:45.926
No. Um... dice.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.328
Glad you like this rotten
old wharf so much,

00:48.329 --> 00:51.465
'cause it's where they're going
to find your rotten old bodies!

00:59.974 --> 01:01.541
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:01.576 --> 01:03.009
This is bad. Ow!

01:03.010 --> 01:05.178
These ropes are tight.
This is really bad.

01:05.179 --> 01:07.013
There's no point
in making us uncomfortable

01:07.014 --> 01:08.415
before you kill us, Felix.

01:08.416 --> 01:09.816
What happened to common courtesy?

01:09.817 --> 01:11.451
Stop talking!
Keep being scared.

01:11.486 --> 01:14.187
Oh, just shoot us already,
for God's sake.

01:14.188 --> 01:15.822
The suspense is boring me.

01:15.857 --> 01:17.991
What?! No! Don't.
What are you doing?

01:17.992 --> 01:19.659
I'm calling his bluff, Bob.

01:19.660 --> 01:22.329
Come on, pull the trigger,
you big baby.

01:22.363 --> 01:24.498
I'm not a baby!
I'm a big boy!

01:24.499 --> 01:26.366
A big, dangerous boy!
Baby.

01:26.367 --> 01:27.434
Stop it!
Baby.

01:27.468 --> 01:29.603
Stop it!
Come on, baby!

01:29.604 --> 01:31.304
Stop teasing him!
I can't help it.

01:31.305 --> 01:33.673
He's incapable of doing
anything right on his own.

01:33.708 --> 01:35.709
Stop saying that!
I'm sick of it! Calvin...

01:37.178 --> 01:38.712
Calvin, I've lived too long

01:38.713 --> 01:41.648
in your stupid, weird shadow
to just shoot you.

01:41.649 --> 01:44.317
You're going to die slowly, tied
to the pier you love so much.

01:44.318 --> 01:45.719
I-I don't love it.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.087
You see that way up there
above your head?

01:47.121 --> 01:48.588
That's the high-tide line.

01:48.623 --> 01:50.023
That's where the water's gonna be

01:50.024 --> 01:52.125
in just a little while.
I see.

01:52.126 --> 01:54.161
You'll watch the tide come in
before you drown,

01:54.162 --> 01:55.562
which will give you time to think

01:55.563 --> 01:56.997
about how all this
could have been avoided

01:56.998 --> 01:59.833
if you'd just stayed on track and
sold the friggin' wharf with me!

01:59.867 --> 02:00.667
Oh, God.

02:00.668 --> 02:03.470
Now I have to kill you and
inherit your stupid voting share

02:03.471 --> 02:05.138
and do what you <i> wouldn't</i> do.

02:05.139 --> 02:07.707
You'll just be some dead guy
getting eaten by crabs,

02:07.742 --> 02:09.142
and <i> I'll</i> be Mr. Fischoeder!

02:09.143 --> 02:10.544
Me, not you!

02:10.578 --> 02:14.314
You'll be Calvin... Crabs, the
stupidest dead person in the world.

02:14.348 --> 02:15.882
Well said! Well, I-I just want to say,

02:15.883 --> 02:18.819
you are already the important
Fischoeder to me, Felix.

02:18.853 --> 02:20.420
I've always felt... Bob. Bob,
Bob, Bob, I see what you're doing.

02:20.421 --> 02:23.223
I see what you're going for
here, but I'm mad at you, too.

02:23.224 --> 02:24.658
Plus, you got to kill the witness.

02:24.659 --> 02:26.059
Everyone knows that.
That is true.

02:26.060 --> 02:27.327
Don't agree with him!

02:27.361 --> 02:29.062
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:29.063 --> 02:31.164
I have to get up there and start
living my new amazing life

02:31.165 --> 02:32.666
as Felix Fischoeder, the condo king

02:32.667 --> 02:34.368
with a dark secret and a girlfriend!

02:34.402 --> 02:36.436
Okay. Oh, God.
Please, Mr. Fischoeder, do something.

02:36.437 --> 02:38.205
I have kids!
Oh, come on, Bob.

02:38.206 --> 02:41.141
Those kids aren't that great.
Felix, come back!

02:41.175 --> 02:43.677
I will... later. I'll see you
when you're dead! Buh-bye!

02:43.711 --> 02:45.345
Help!

02:45.380 --> 02:47.681
Well, thanks to your father,

02:47.682 --> 02:50.417
we aren't getting any new
condos in this dumb town.

02:50.451 --> 02:53.019
No new money and no
Bob's Burgers on the Beach.

02:53.054 --> 02:55.889
Nope. Just back to our
boring, crappy lives

02:55.890 --> 02:59.059
in this stinky, poopy, rundown,
shanty town by the sea.

02:59.060 --> 03:00.527
Where is Dad anyway?

03:00.561 --> 03:03.030
I haven't seen him
for, like, 45 minutes.

03:03.031 --> 03:05.032
Do you think
he has a separate Dad pad?

03:05.033 --> 03:06.600
Maybe he's back at the restaurant.

03:06.601 --> 03:08.101
That's where I always picture him.

03:10.438 --> 03:12.205
Hmm, no Bob.

03:12.206 --> 03:14.541
Well, I guess we'll open up
for dinner without him.

03:14.575 --> 03:16.943
Maybe he's out partying with
Mr. Fischoeder, his new buddy.

03:16.944 --> 03:18.412
Big boys night out, I guess.

03:18.413 --> 03:20.247
We can have a girls night in.

03:20.248 --> 03:22.582
I have a great new nail polish
I've been dying to try.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.051
It's called "clear."

03:24.052 --> 03:26.219
Sure, if you want
to look like a prostitute.

03:26.254 --> 03:28.955
Fanny, there's my silly skunk!

03:28.956 --> 03:31.258
No! Get away from me!
Get off!

03:31.259 --> 03:33.393
Sweetie, I know you're
upset, but listen.

03:33.394 --> 03:34.795
I took care of everything.

03:34.796 --> 03:36.463
The condos are back on, all right?

03:36.497 --> 03:39.633
So, I will just put my arm
around you thusly. Uh-uh!

03:39.667 --> 03:41.101
Fanny!

03:41.102 --> 03:42.235
I just said...

03:42.236 --> 03:43.837
I took care of everything.

03:43.838 --> 03:45.739
So, I'm getting my recording
studio and my nightclub?

03:45.740 --> 03:47.274
Yes! Damn it!

03:47.275 --> 03:48.675
I took care of it!

03:48.676 --> 03:50.077
Don't yell at me.

03:50.111 --> 03:51.478
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

03:51.479 --> 03:52.913
I'm... Oh, God.

03:52.914 --> 03:54.748
You know, I'm having a stressful day.

03:54.749 --> 03:57.050
Don't care.
Hey, let's, uh, walk around

03:57.085 --> 03:58.452
and see where that nightclub will be.

03:58.453 --> 04:00.153
Okay. How about over there?

04:00.154 --> 04:01.822
No! Okay. How about...
uh, you like that location?

04:01.823 --> 04:04.491
Mm... mm-mm. Right. Let's...
look to our left now.

04:04.492 --> 04:05.792
I don't like any of 'em.

04:08.262 --> 04:09.796
Quit squirming around, Bob.

04:09.797 --> 04:11.431
Do you have worms?

04:11.432 --> 04:13.100
'Cause I do, and you're
making them crazy.

04:13.101 --> 04:15.469
I'm trying to get my phone
out of my back pocket.

04:15.470 --> 04:16.870
I can't reach it.

04:16.870 --> 04:18.872
Mr. Fischoeder,
you need to get it for me.

04:18.873 --> 04:20.339
Oh. All right.

04:20.341 --> 04:22.676
Ooh. Ooh! That's unfortunate. What is?

04:22.710 --> 04:24.611
Your butt.
Oh. Sorry?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.980
Up here, you're okay, but
down here, it gets bad.

04:26.981 --> 04:29.283
Okay, just pull the phone out. Okay.

04:29.284 --> 04:31.652
Flip it open! Really?
You have a flip phone?

04:31.653 --> 04:35.022
Yes. It works fine to make calls,
and that's what phones are for.

04:35.023 --> 04:36.623
Nonsense, Bob.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.792
Phones are for playing
tiny games about fruit on.

04:38.793 --> 04:40.494
Just hit the call button,
Mr. Fischoeder.

04:40.495 --> 04:43.797
It'll dial Linda since
I called her last. Ah!

04:45.567 --> 04:47.034
Hello?

04:47.068 --> 04:48.502
She answered!
Linda! Linda!

04:48.503 --> 04:50.304
Hello, Linda!

04:50.338 --> 04:52.039
Bob? I can't hear you, hon.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.307
Linda! It's loud.

04:53.341 --> 04:55.042
I think he's at a bar.

04:55.043 --> 04:56.643
I'm gonna kill him.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.212
Oh, what's that laughing?
What is...? Bob?!

04:59.213 --> 05:02.182
Linda, listen!
Felix tied us up under the pier!

05:02.183 --> 05:03.617
Call the police!

05:03.651 --> 05:05.085
I think he butt-dialed you.

05:05.086 --> 05:07.187
Yup, that's his butt's voice.

05:07.188 --> 05:10.157
Dad, it's Tina. Are you at
a party? Are there boys there?

05:10.158 --> 05:11.992
Bob, you're wasting all our minutes,

05:11.993 --> 05:14.595
so you better be out
buying more minutes! Bye!

05:16.731 --> 05:18.732
I still can't hear you!

05:18.733 --> 05:20.300
He's pocket-dialing me again.

05:20.335 --> 05:21.768
Lin, don't hang up!
No, no, no, no.

05:21.769 --> 05:23.503
Ugh! Try her again.

05:23.504 --> 05:25.239
Bob, I think we're coming
off a little desperate.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.007
We <i> are</i> desperate!

05:28.209 --> 05:31.915
Bob, I'm putting your butt
on "silent," for once.

05:31.946 --> 05:33.313
Who wants ice cream?

05:33.348 --> 05:36.550
No! No, no!
Ooh, that's chilly.

05:40.033 --> 05:42.201
That 911 operator
did not like us, Bob.

05:42.202 --> 05:44.570
No one can hear us.
They thought we were prank calling.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.272
Maybe we could text 911.

05:46.273 --> 05:48.241
Can that sad little thing text?

05:48.242 --> 05:50.476
Sort of.
Oh, we could text Linda!

05:50.477 --> 05:52.778
It'll be hard, but let's try it.

05:52.779 --> 05:54.380
Yeah, it's hard.

05:54.381 --> 05:56.382
I can't really see what I'm typing.

05:56.383 --> 05:58.251
I'm just pressing on the phone.

05:58.285 --> 06:00.786
Wow, the tide is coming in fast.

06:00.787 --> 06:02.788
It's the same speed
it always comes in.

06:02.789 --> 06:04.457
Don't blame this on the ocean, Bob.

06:06.894 --> 06:08.294
Hey, what are you looking at?

06:08.295 --> 06:09.729
My boobs are up here.

06:09.730 --> 06:11.230
Oh, sorry, babe. I...

06:11.231 --> 06:13.132
There they are...
Milo and Otis.

06:13.133 --> 06:16.102
No, that one's Milo, that one's Otis.

06:16.103 --> 06:18.538
♪ Ding-dong, diddly,
ding-dong, dong! ♪

06:20.174 --> 06:22.575
Mom, you got a text!
You're blowing up!

06:22.609 --> 06:23.509
What's your secret?

06:23.510 --> 06:24.977
Maybe it's Jimmy Jr.

06:24.978 --> 06:28.114
texting you to ask you what I'm
doing for the rest of my life.

06:28.115 --> 06:29.582
He's gonna be pretty
disappointed when he finds out.

06:29.616 --> 06:31.150
It's from your dad.

06:31.185 --> 06:33.186
"Help. I'm tired yo." What?!

06:33.187 --> 06:35.888
Of course he's tired.
He's <i> so</i> old.

06:35.923 --> 06:37.423
Your father doesn't say "yo."

06:37.424 --> 06:39.125
The only time he ever said "yo" was

06:39.126 --> 06:41.060
when he went to Tina's
class for career day.

06:41.094 --> 06:42.495
Maybe that's not
what he meant to type.

06:42.496 --> 06:43.830
Maybe it's autocorrected.

06:43.864 --> 06:45.798
Oh, yeah.
Like that time I texted mom

06:45.799 --> 06:48.935
that I was super horny
when I was really super hungry.

06:48.969 --> 06:51.237
Why would I be horny?
I'm not an antelope.

06:51.271 --> 06:53.206
I wonder what his text
was supposed to be.

06:53.207 --> 06:55.074
What if it was something
that would make us all LOL?

06:55.108 --> 06:56.976
Well, let's figure it out.
Should be easy.

06:56.977 --> 06:58.611
Dad doesn't know that many words.

07:01.181 --> 07:02.839
We got to get that phone.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.650
I'll try to get it with my foot.

07:04.685 --> 07:07.987
Oh, look at those nimble,
hairy little toe-men go.

07:08.021 --> 07:09.655
What the hell was that?

07:09.656 --> 07:11.991
I think I took a picture,
and I think I sent it.

07:11.992 --> 07:13.659
I hope you got my best side.

07:13.660 --> 07:15.628
I'm talking about
my wiener bulge. Stop.

07:15.629 --> 07:18.164
Tina, are you wearing my
bike lock as a necklace?

07:18.165 --> 07:19.966
Kind of? Well, it's very flattering.

07:19.967 --> 07:21.634
It makes your head look... safe.

07:21.635 --> 07:23.469
Now he sent me a weird picture.

07:23.470 --> 07:25.805
Okay, you know, I'm starting to
get a little worried about him.

07:25.806 --> 07:27.373
Let me see that.

07:27.407 --> 07:28.975
Just looks like a white blob to me.

07:29.009 --> 07:30.910
Look who's talking.

07:30.911 --> 07:32.678
Oh... that's Mr. Fischoeder's butt.

07:32.679 --> 07:35.047
How do you know what Mr.
Fischoeder's butt looks like?

07:35.082 --> 07:37.483
I have a photographic butt memory.
Oh, yeah.

07:37.484 --> 07:38.818
Wait a minute.
What's that thing?

07:38.852 --> 07:40.386
Could be a rope or maybe a breadstick?

07:40.387 --> 07:43.790
Ah, they stole my idea
for breadstick ropes.

07:43.824 --> 07:45.024
I think I got it.

07:45.058 --> 07:46.859
I'm getting it up your leg.
Grab it.

07:46.894 --> 07:49.095
Grab it.
Oh, but it's all footy.

07:49.096 --> 07:52.331
Grab it! If it drops in the water,
it's over! Fine.

07:52.332 --> 07:55.034
Okay, the autocorrect
suggestions for "tired"

07:55.068 --> 07:56.702
and "yo" are up there.

07:56.703 --> 07:58.404
Now we match 'em up
and see what makes sense.

07:58.439 --> 08:00.073
Maybe he meant, "I cried, y'all."

08:00.074 --> 08:01.774
Why is he now Southern?!

08:01.775 --> 08:03.176
Could it be...

08:03.210 --> 08:04.844
"I tried blow"?

08:04.878 --> 08:07.413
We were gonna do that
together. Just once.

08:07.448 --> 08:09.549
Oh, my God! Teddy was right!

08:09.583 --> 08:11.217
I knew it!
Wait... about what?

08:11.251 --> 08:13.052
About the picture, the rope.

08:13.053 --> 08:16.456
"Tired yo" is... "Tied up"!

08:16.457 --> 08:18.157
Dad's tied up somewhere!

08:19.560 --> 08:20.960
He's in a meeting!

08:20.961 --> 08:23.362
And he's going
to be there for a while.

08:23.363 --> 08:24.764
I hope this is working.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.399
I tried to write,
"Felix has us under the pier."

08:26.400 --> 08:29.302
I'm not sure if I got it all, but
it should be close. Hit "send."

08:29.303 --> 08:30.803
Are you sure, Bob? Are you
going to yell at me again?

08:30.804 --> 08:32.739
Just hit "send." Okay.

08:32.740 --> 08:33.905
Oh, no! Oh, no!

08:33.907 --> 08:35.073
Aha!

08:35.109 --> 08:37.909
Well, who gets to yell at whom now?

08:37.910 --> 08:39.946
Oh, my God.
Did you hit "send"?

08:39.947 --> 08:42.248
Well, I hit something.
Let's talk about something else.

08:42.249 --> 08:47.320
I spy with my little eye one
large cloud shaped like a camel.

08:47.321 --> 08:48.755
Right there.
Where?

08:48.756 --> 08:50.089
That one.
That one, yes.

08:50.124 --> 08:51.624
Aah! Aah! Aah!

08:51.625 --> 08:53.793
Oh, my God,
who's got my Bobby tied up?

08:53.794 --> 08:56.062
Let's think. Who are Dad's enemies?

08:56.063 --> 08:59.465
Time, gravity, toothpaste...
Jimmy Pesto.

08:59.466 --> 09:02.068
Eh, Jimmy's got
an alibi, which is,

09:02.102 --> 09:04.404
he is dumb.

09:04.405 --> 09:09.509
It's from Dad! It says, "Fix
got under seven seven,"

09:09.510 --> 09:12.979
then a shrimp emoji,
and the word "Pierre."

09:12.980 --> 09:14.781
Oh, God! Someone named Pierre's
got him tied up,

09:14.782 --> 09:16.416
and he's force-feeding him shrimp.

09:17.918 --> 09:20.119
Okay, everyone, stand back!
Help! Help!

09:20.154 --> 09:22.755
You have to pull yourself together!

09:22.756 --> 09:25.491
You have two children and
a Louise to take care of!

09:25.492 --> 09:27.293
Okay, okay.
Stop slapping me.

09:27.294 --> 09:28.294
Oh, no, wait...
one more.

09:29.296 --> 09:30.330
Wait a second.

09:30.331 --> 09:32.965
Guys, there's a restaurant a few
blocks away, called Pierre's,

09:32.966 --> 09:34.834
and they serve shrimp and breadsticks.

09:34.868 --> 09:36.602
Breadsticks! They're all right.
They're not great.

09:36.603 --> 09:39.939
Quick, Mom. Let's close the
restaurant forever and go find Dad!

09:39.940 --> 09:41.474
Hang on, Dad.
Here we come.

09:41.475 --> 09:44.077
And hang on, shrimp.
Here comes Gene.

09:44.111 --> 09:45.812
Well, look at the bright side.

09:45.813 --> 09:48.214
With the water this high, we
can finally go to the bathroom

09:48.215 --> 09:49.215
without being embarrassed.

09:49.216 --> 09:50.516
Oh, that's warm.
Yeah.

09:50.517 --> 09:52.852
You doing that?
I'm doing it.

09:56.810 --> 09:58.310
Okay, so, I'll do the talking.

09:58.311 --> 09:59.678
No, I'll do the talking,
you do the roughing up.

09:59.679 --> 10:01.080
And I'll eat the shrimp.

10:01.081 --> 10:02.514
And I'll watch Gene eat the shrimp.

10:02.515 --> 10:04.183
And I'll look around for clues.

10:04.184 --> 10:07.219
But if any of those clues are
shrimp, bag 'em and give 'em to me.

10:07.253 --> 10:08.520
Hello. Welcome to Pierre's.

10:08.521 --> 10:10.022
Table for...
what do we have, five?

10:10.023 --> 10:11.023
Yeah.

10:11.024 --> 10:12.091
We're not here to eat.

10:12.092 --> 10:14.059
We're looking for this guy.

10:14.094 --> 10:15.728
His name's Bob, and you kidnapped him!

10:15.762 --> 10:17.696
Let me at him!
Give me back my son!

10:17.697 --> 10:19.865
I don't have your...
What are you...? Please!

10:19.866 --> 10:21.700
All right, let me look
at the toilet picture again.

10:21.701 --> 10:23.268
You got a lot of nerve, buddy.

10:23.269 --> 10:24.903
Ow! Ah, can't breathe.

10:24.938 --> 10:26.672
Seeing... spots.

10:28.575 --> 10:30.809
Don't want to... die.

10:30.844 --> 10:32.411
Wow, that guy really fainted.

10:32.445 --> 10:33.545
And barfed.
I feel bad.

10:33.546 --> 10:35.114
He got really upset there.

10:35.115 --> 10:36.882
All we're trying to do
is just talk to him.

10:36.916 --> 10:38.250
But he still gave me shrimp.

10:38.251 --> 10:39.685
And he said come back anytime.

10:39.686 --> 10:41.053
What a class act.

10:41.054 --> 10:43.022
Uh, well, what do we do now?

10:43.023 --> 10:44.890
<i>Yep. Uh-huh.</i>

10:44.891 --> 10:46.091
What is it? What is it?

10:46.126 --> 10:47.860
I think I know where Bob is.

10:47.861 --> 10:50.863
Where?! He took the chug
boat out to Alcohol Island.

10:50.864 --> 10:52.231
These are drunk texts.

10:52.232 --> 10:55.734
I know 'em when I see 'em. Oh...
Look, here are 87 texts I sent

10:55.735 --> 10:57.703
to my ex-wife last night.

10:57.704 --> 11:00.939
"I'm sorry I'm not sorry"?

11:00.940 --> 11:02.708
Well, Bosco was no help.

11:02.709 --> 11:04.076
We got to face facts.

11:04.077 --> 11:05.544
No one cares about Dad except us.

11:05.545 --> 11:07.112
And, really, it's just Mom.

11:07.147 --> 11:09.381
And me. And Tina.
Time to split up and search.

11:09.382 --> 11:12.484
If we want to find him, we're gonna
have to track him down ourselves.

11:12.485 --> 11:14.853
Does anyone have anything
of his we can smell?

11:14.888 --> 11:15.954
I have his jeans.

11:15.989 --> 11:17.423
We all have his genes.

11:17.424 --> 11:18.424
No, I have his jeans.

11:18.425 --> 11:19.959
I cut them into shorts.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.161
Oh, come on, like you're not
all wearing a pair

11:22.162 --> 11:24.797
of Dad's cutoff jeans
under your clothes!

11:24.831 --> 11:27.600
Wow, wow, wow.

11:27.601 --> 11:30.169
I didn't think he'd go through
with it. Where's your family, Bob?

11:30.170 --> 11:32.004
Why aren't they looking for us?
I don't know.

11:32.005 --> 11:33.672
Maybe they didn't get our texts.

11:33.673 --> 11:35.174
Well, things are bad, Bob.

11:35.175 --> 11:37.109

13:31.458 --> 13:33.259
but now I don't like it.

13:33.293 --> 13:34.793
We could end up with just Mom.

13:34.794 --> 13:37.229
No offense, Mom.
No, no, we need your dad.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.799
You kids are a two-adult,
two-bottle-of-wine-a-night job.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.567
Ugh! Where the hell is he?

13:41.568 --> 13:42.802
He didn't just disappear.

13:42.803 --> 13:44.703
Oh, hey, look.
There's Felix.

13:44.704 --> 13:48.641
We got to warn him his brother's
in danger! Felix! Felix!

13:48.642 --> 13:51.644
Linda! What are you doing here?
We got these weird texts from Bob.

13:51.645 --> 13:53.913
We think he's with your brother.
You see?

13:53.914 --> 13:56.415
My-my daughter says that's
probably his butt. Definitely.

13:56.416 --> 13:58.250
Definitely his butt.
Look, okay?!

13:58.251 --> 13:59.852
What?
I mean, look,

13:59.886 --> 14:01.720
I'm trying to be super
friendly here, Linda, but...

14:01.721 --> 14:04.590
I don't know where he is, okay?

14:04.591 --> 14:05.925
Linda, Linda, Linda.

14:05.926 --> 14:07.927
Bob and my brother are probably just,

14:07.928 --> 14:11.297
right at this moment, terrified...
What? gasping for...

14:11.331 --> 14:12.565
What?
Gasping for what?

14:12.566 --> 14:13.599
Cheese?

14:13.600 --> 14:16.268
You are sweating a lot, Felix.

14:16.269 --> 14:18.971
You are moist.
You don't know how moist I usually am.

14:19.005 --> 14:20.106
You feeling okay?

14:20.107 --> 14:21.841
Uh... ooh...

14:21.842 --> 14:23.309
ah... oh...

14:23.310 --> 14:25.111
oh...
Well, Felix seems fine.

14:25.145 --> 14:26.412
oh... uh...

14:26.413 --> 14:28.414
Calvin!
What have I done?

14:28.415 --> 14:30.816
I recognize that sound.

14:32.819 --> 14:34.920
From the phone call.
He's here!

14:34.921 --> 14:37.656
Bob's right here somewhere.
Hey, where'd Felix go?

14:37.657 --> 14:39.992
Why is Felix going
down under the pier?

14:39.993 --> 14:41.927
I need him to pay for this hot dog.

14:41.928 --> 14:44.096
Do you have any money?
How about you? Little one.

14:44.097 --> 14:46.332
How 'bout you, glasses? No?

14:46.366 --> 14:47.700
The pier?

14:47.701 --> 14:49.468
Pierre is pier.

14:49.503 --> 14:52.271
Bob's under the pier!
Oh, my God!

14:58.111 --> 14:59.979
Uh, we need three
pedal boats... and hurry!

14:59.980 --> 15:02.681
Well, if you want a fast boat,
you really want the turtle.

15:02.682 --> 15:04.316
I know it's counterintuitive...

15:04.351 --> 15:06.952
Just get in!
Now, you need to wear a life vest...

15:06.953 --> 15:08.487
Move it, chump!

15:08.488 --> 15:10.456
Enjoy your time on the water.
It's beautiful.

15:10.457 --> 15:12.692
Dad, if you're dying, don't!

15:12.693 --> 15:14.455
It's not your time, Dad!

15:14.461 --> 15:17.296
I want to put you in a
nursing home next year!

15:17.297 --> 15:19.131
You've got to teach me to shave!

15:19.132 --> 15:20.499
Everywhere!

15:25.835 --> 15:26.935
Hey!

15:26.969 --> 15:28.703
someone's coming!
Over here!

15:28.704 --> 15:30.572
Over here...

15:30.606 --> 15:31.506
It's Felix!

15:31.507 --> 15:32.507
I knew it!

15:32.508 --> 15:33.808
Oh, no. No, no, no.

15:33.843 --> 15:36.845
No. I knew he didn't have the ball...

15:36.879 --> 15:38.880
What do you want now, Felix?

15:38.881 --> 15:40.482
I'm here to save you!
Oh.

15:40.483 --> 15:42.317
Hurry up then!
Untie us!

15:42.351 --> 15:45.620
Right, so, just going to, uh...

15:45.621 --> 15:47.922
shoot into the water
to undo the ropes.

15:47.957 --> 15:49.224
No! No, no, no.

15:49.225 --> 15:50.959
That's a bad plan, Felix!
Bad plan!

15:50.960 --> 15:52.961
Mm...
He's too chicken to jump in.

15:55.798 --> 15:58.566
Oh, my God, could you stop
taunting your brother?

15:58.567 --> 16:00.135
Yeah, and I'm not chicken!

16:00.136 --> 16:01.303
I'm... It's just
the water's, uh, choppy.

16:01.337 --> 16:02.470
Bobby!

16:02.505 --> 16:03.872
Linda!
Dad!

16:03.906 --> 16:05.707
Everyone quiet!
I'm preparing to jump in

16:05.708 --> 16:10.478
and save them... just, uh, need
to mentally get ready here.

16:10.513 --> 16:11.446
Oh, come on!

16:11.480 --> 16:13.214
Someone, please hurry!

16:13.249 --> 16:15.550
Felix, what the hell is going on?

16:15.584 --> 16:17.352
I was gonna kill my brother
so I could sell the wharf

16:17.353 --> 16:19.587
and get you your nightclub,
but I-I can't do it.

16:19.588 --> 16:20.989
What?!
I'm going in.

16:20.990 --> 16:22.390
Uh-uh, Felix.

16:22.425 --> 16:24.459
Nobody move!

16:24.493 --> 16:26.962
What?  Fanny,
what are you doing?

16:26.996 --> 16:28.229
I won't let you ruin my dream.

16:28.230 --> 16:30.165
This is my time!

16:30.166 --> 16:32.834
All of my life, people have been
telling me what I can't do.

16:32.835 --> 16:34.336
"Fanny, you can't show your butt."

16:34.337 --> 16:36.171
"Fanny, you can't shoot people."

16:36.172 --> 16:38.673
Oh, God.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.643
Shut up! I can't think.

16:41.677 --> 16:42.844
What else is new?

16:42.845 --> 16:44.512
Okay, Linda, you and the kids

16:44.513 --> 16:47.082
get off your boats, get in
the water and then drown.

16:47.116 --> 16:49.851
Can't we just do the first part
and splash around and have fun?

16:49.885 --> 16:51.886
Oh, come on, Fanny, I'm your gal pal.

16:51.887 --> 16:54.189
Shopping? Right?

16:54.223 --> 16:55.357
No! Out!

16:57.026 --> 16:58.393
Kids, grab onto me.

16:58.394 --> 16:59.728
Use me to float.

16:59.762 --> 17:02.197
Fanny, don't do this.
Shut up, Felix!

17:02.198 --> 17:04.598
Just sit there and inherit his money.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.402
Okay, everyone start drowning...

17:07.403 --> 17:08.637
now!

17:09.903 --> 17:13.008
Glug, glug!

17:13.041 --> 17:15.042
Ach!
You guys are so bad at drowning.

17:15.044 --> 17:17.012
I guess I'm gonna have to shoot you!

17:17.046 --> 17:18.313
Oh, God.

17:18.314 --> 17:19.881
I'm sorry I got us into this.

17:19.882 --> 17:20.882
Kids, I love you.

17:20.883 --> 17:22.250
And, Linda, I love you, too.

17:22.251 --> 17:24.085
Almost as much as the kids, but not...

17:24.119 --> 17:26.454
Oh, Bobby... I love you, too.

17:26.454 --> 17:29.057
I'm sorry I was mad at you
about the stupid condos.

17:29.058 --> 17:31.893
I love you, Mom!
And you, Dad!

17:31.894 --> 17:34.229
I love you all.
But that's just between us.

17:34.230 --> 17:36.231
I love everyone!
I love you, Mom.

17:36.232 --> 17:38.533
Oh, I love you too, honey.

17:38.568 --> 17:40.268
What-what are they all doing?
I have no idea.

17:40.269 --> 17:41.970
- I love you guys!
- I love you, Dad!

17:41.971 --> 17:43.572
- Oh, God, they're starting again.
- I love you, Mom.

17:43.606 --> 17:46.208
Okay, listen up!
I'm gonna shoot you first.

17:46.242 --> 17:47.609
One...
Bobby, no!

17:47.643 --> 17:49.578
two...

17:49.612 --> 17:50.486
Fanny, wait!
What?!

17:50.513 --> 17:52.347
Uh, uh, before I die,

17:52.348 --> 17:55.383
um, could you... I would really
like to hear one of your songs.

17:55.418 --> 17:56.151
Really?

17:56.152 --> 17:57.252
Oh, my God.

17:57.253 --> 17:58.453
So sweet. Which one?

17:58.454 --> 17:59.988
Uh, the one about the dancing?

17:59.989 --> 18:01.623
And it's really loud?

18:01.657 --> 18:03.358
"Dancing So Loud"?
Yes!

18:03.359 --> 18:05.360
Well, that one's
not really finished yet.

18:05.361 --> 18:07.829
I'll sing "Mr. Dance Floor." It's hot.
Oh, good, good.

18:07.864 --> 18:09.631
♪ Who's that knocking on my door? ♪

18:09.632 --> 18:11.666
♪ Ooh, it's Mr. Dance Floor... ♪

18:11.701 --> 18:13.535
Linda, the piling. What?

18:13.536 --> 18:14.936
The piling near Fanny, Lin.

18:14.971 --> 18:17.372
Ram that boat shaped
like a turtle into it.

18:17.373 --> 18:18.807
Oh. Got it.

18:18.841 --> 18:20.075
Got it.

18:20.109 --> 18:21.843

18:21.844 --> 18:24.246

18:25.515 --> 18:26.281
Hmm?

18:31.888 --> 18:33.688
Quick! Someone untie us!

18:33.723 --> 18:35.524
I'm coming for you, Bobby!

18:35.525 --> 18:37.726
I'm not that great at knots,
but I'll try.

18:38.794 --> 18:39.528
Uh...

18:39.529 --> 18:40.202
Uh...

18:40.229 --> 18:41.029
Uh...

18:41.030 --> 18:43.131
Oh, thank God.

18:43.166 --> 18:44.733
Yay, Mom. Hmm?

18:47.970 --> 18:51.606
Oh, God, swim away! Swim away!

18:51.641 --> 18:54.643
Everyone dive! Dive!

18:58.381 --> 19:00.048
Tina!

19:00.049 --> 19:02.884
Thank God, you beautiful
four-eyed son of a bitch.

19:02.885 --> 19:04.319
Mom!

19:04.320 --> 19:06.288
There's my girls.
Where's Gene?

19:06.322 --> 19:08.523
I'm over here.
Just doin' my own thing.

19:08.558 --> 19:10.859
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Who cares?

19:10.860 --> 19:12.527
Where's my Bobby?
Ah!

19:12.562 --> 19:15.664
You saved us, Linda.
Thank God we live in a time

19:15.698 --> 19:17.866
where women can learn to swim.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.335
A burial at sea... it's what
the carousel would've wanted.

19:20.336 --> 19:22.370
We talked about it
a lot toward the end.

19:22.405 --> 19:23.772
My little Fanny-apple!

19:23.773 --> 19:25.740
Uh-uh, my hair's wet!

19:25.775 --> 19:26.875
Where are they going?

19:26.909 --> 19:28.410
They're swim-running away!

19:28.411 --> 19:30.278
They're escaping to Mexico!

19:30.279 --> 19:32.881
Or whatever's across the water.
What's over there?

19:37.420 --> 19:39.554
So I guess
they'll arrest Felix, too.

19:39.589 --> 19:42.290
No. I told them Fanny was
responsible for everything.

19:42.291 --> 19:44.059
What?!
Look at him, Bob.

19:44.060 --> 19:45.627
We can't send him to jail.

19:45.628 --> 19:46.895
He'd hate it there.

19:46.896 --> 19:49.131
He tried to kill us.
Not really.

19:49.132 --> 19:50.799
We were just, uh, wrestling.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.434
Like brothers.
Wrestling?

19:52.435 --> 19:54.269
Tussling? Bonding.
I don't know.

19:54.270 --> 19:56.538
Oh, my God.
Besides, he came back for us.

19:56.539 --> 19:58.206
I told you he'd never
go through with it.

19:58.207 --> 20:00.442
I'm gonna tell them.
Hey, how 'bout $4,000?

20:00.443 --> 20:02.210
Would that make you
feel better? What?!

20:02.211 --> 20:04.112
You can't put a price on my family.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.547
Two.

20:05.548 --> 20:07.182
One. Blastoff!

20:07.216 --> 20:08.984
Guys, will you give me
a minute here? Great!

20:08.985 --> 20:10.252
We'll just forget the whole thing.
I didn't say...

20:10.286 --> 20:11.753
What a crazy day!

20:11.788 --> 20:13.989
God, I had cereal in the morning,

20:13.990 --> 20:16.224
and by nighttime I'm getting murdered.
Lin, I'm trying

20:16.225 --> 20:18.427
to work out some money thing
here with Mr. Fischoeder, so...

20:18.461 --> 20:22.097
Uh-uh. You need a warm shower
and a hot meal, mister.

20:22.098 --> 20:23.932
Felix, I get one free punch.

20:23.933 --> 20:26.268
Come here.
You know the rules.

20:26.269 --> 20:28.270
Bob, I'm glad we found you.

20:28.271 --> 20:29.671
I'm glad, too, Lin.

20:29.672 --> 20:31.339
The Belchers are a land family.

20:31.340 --> 20:34.076
We should be together in a restaurant,
not under some dumb wharf.

20:34.077 --> 20:35.277
Let's go home.

20:35.278 --> 20:36.812
It's not dumb.

20:36.813 --> 20:38.480
That's the wharf we saved;
That Dad saved.

20:38.481 --> 20:40.349
And look how it thanks us.

20:40.350 --> 20:42.017
Well, it sort of saved us.

20:42.018 --> 20:43.852
We get it, Dad...
you love the wharf.

20:43.853 --> 20:45.287
I don't even
want to look at it.

20:45.288 --> 20:49.024
Ooh, I'm gonna have a bottle of
wine and eat some croutons in bed.

20:49.025 --> 20:50.926
Yay, crouton party
in Mom and Dad's bed.

20:50.927 --> 20:52.327
- No.
- Yes!

20:52.328 --> 20:53.895
Oh, my God.
