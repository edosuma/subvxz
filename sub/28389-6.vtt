WEBVTT

00:06.680 --> 00:09.650
- He's back everyone.
- How I've missed this.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.010
Larry, wait for me!

00:13.580 --> 00:15.810
Mind your head,
or I'll jump on it!

00:17.350 --> 00:19.520
- I'm coming in!
- No!

00:21.600 --> 00:25.500
- Still gruesomely pea brained.
- Still with your bullshit.

00:27.020 --> 00:30.530
Spiros's wife had an affair
with Basil?! Silly Baz?

00:30.560 --> 00:33.650
Oh don't.
I feel so guilty about it.

00:34.330 --> 00:37.510
Leslie was only trying
to help Spiros and I be together.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.410
He's been cycling around
desperately trying to find Spi...

00:40.510 --> 00:42.060
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

00:42.990 --> 00:45.800
Well, my travels were eye-opening,
thanks for asking.

00:45.950 --> 00:47.500
Ah Gerry!

00:47.650 --> 00:50.730
I was approached in Athens
to work for British Intelligence.

00:51.550 --> 00:53.610
- I said no, of course.
- Or did you?

00:53.740 --> 00:55.680
- Yes, I did.
- I'd love to be a spy.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.360
Can you put my name forward,
please?

00:57.390 --> 00:58.560
- You'd start a war.
- No, don't.

00:58.590 --> 01:01.660
I don't need to be a spy,
I combat idiocy through my art.

01:02.170 --> 01:04.750
I thought we could put on a play,
to celebrate me being back.

01:04.780 --> 01:07.720
- Let's do Porgy &amp; Bess!
- No, we're too white.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.280
I've written a play.

01:09.310 --> 01:13.170
It's 'The Odyssey' adapted to tell
our story since we came to Corfu.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.270
Well, I'm not doing it.
The theatre's daft.

01:16.170 --> 01:19.220
That's a shame, I had you down
for Odysseus, the hero.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.350
I need a distraction, I'll play him.

01:24.140 --> 01:27.170
Well, I did bring you all here
on an epic Greek journey,

01:27.200 --> 01:28.290
which we are still on.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.300
- Very good.
- Thank you.

01:31.340 --> 01:35.080
Oh, just to update you:
Europe's on the brink of war.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.340
Another reason to do
a rip-roaring theatrical satire

01:37.380 --> 01:39.150
on the folly of battle.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.280
Yes, but this is the safe end
of Europe.

01:42.190 --> 01:46.300
- Hardly. Italy's invaded Albania.
- That's only two miles over the water.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.300
Well we're all ignoring it.

01:48.330 --> 01:51.340
We're all back together
and we're not going anywhere.

02:35.380 --> 02:39.300
THE DURRELLS

02:43.220 --> 02:45.370
Aren't you interested
in the world, mother?

02:46.210 --> 02:48.300
There's been too much
going on around here.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.360
The world's come a poor second.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.280
You can't live your life in denial.

02:58.290 --> 02:59.890
If you had lived through the Great War,

02:59.920 --> 03:02.170
you'd be less keen to discuss
a new one.

03:02.430 --> 03:07.320
And more keen on innocent pleasures,
like spoon making.

03:08.450 --> 03:11.300
The returning belle-lettrist!

03:11.330 --> 03:13.360
The dapper bewhiskered polymath!

03:14.420 --> 03:17.370
- The curse of over-education.
- Theo, we'll talk later.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.390
I must finish my play.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.450
You're God by the way.

03:24.380 --> 03:25.390
Praise be.

03:26.310 --> 03:27.330
How are you?

03:28.370 --> 03:31.480
A little wistful, since finding this.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.310
Four years, and twice the size.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.260
Do me a favour, Supreme Being,
stop the years rushing by...

03:50.400 --> 03:54.380
This is a python. I was given her
by a retiring pet shop owner.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.270
Asian geese. They're another pair
that breeds for life.

03:59.420 --> 04:01.270
Unlike a lot of humans.

04:05.410 --> 04:06.420
Galini!

04:06.450 --> 04:09.450
My Greek friend will explain
that in her beautiful way.

04:10.230 --> 04:11.250
Yes.

04:12.260 --> 04:17.329
Asian geese they mate
and stay together for life.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.270
Sit down please.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.430
I have an announcement.

04:35.220 --> 04:38.220
I've learnt a lot about myself
over the last few months.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.260
I'm more mature and less
stupid than I suspected.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.300
Did you not notice?

04:46.250 --> 04:49.290
Yes. I'll shout out if I disagree
about anything.

04:49.450 --> 04:54.230
But in one way I'm not yet a woman,
and I want to correct that.

04:54.310 --> 04:56.270
By giving myself to Nikos.

05:01.390 --> 05:05.270
You're brilliant as a fish,
any thoughts as a mother?

05:05.510 --> 05:09.460
Well, do you, do you love Nikos?

05:09.500 --> 05:14.490
I find him enormously attractive, and
making love is supposed to be huge fun.

05:15.550 --> 05:16.640
I can't really remember.

05:17.490 --> 05:21.520
I said no to Zoltan even though he was
very keen, to put it mildly.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.360
There were times I thought
he'd explode.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.910
I don't really need
to know the ins and outs...

05:24.940 --> 05:27.460
Now I'm wondering,
what am I waiting for?

05:58.510 --> 06:00.670
I forgot the corkscrew, sorry.

06:01.500 --> 06:05.470
Another idea that seemed good
when you started, Leslie Durrells.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.540
That's really not fair, Spiros.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.710
I only did it so that you could be
with my mother.

06:11.740 --> 06:14.640
Oh, you might swallow
bits of glass and die.

06:15.630 --> 06:16.670
I don't care.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.600
Well, my mother cares about you.

06:24.770 --> 06:26.540
Thanks.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.540
It's easier here, living on the beach.

06:31.700 --> 06:32.720
Just me and the seagulls.

06:32.750 --> 06:36.680
There's nothing stopping you
and my mother being together, surely.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.540
Apart from pride.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.740
Pride has a poor reputation,
but I like it.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.680
Without it, I am
just a homeless taxi-driver.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.720
No, that's rubbish.

06:51.550 --> 06:52.590
I know your problem.

06:53.750 --> 06:56.560
You've loved my mother
ever since you met her,

06:56.590 --> 07:00.590
and you feel guilty because
that's what broke your marriage.

07:01.650 --> 07:05.650
The only cure for that is to stop
feeling guilty and feel happy.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.230
By coming back to the house,
and being with her.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.210
Please.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.240
Look at that poster.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.150
They are all useless.

07:44.150 --> 07:48.100
So we open our play on Odysseus,

07:48.150 --> 07:51.150
the foremost fighting hero
of Greek Mythology, with your crew...

07:51.180 --> 07:54.040
Your ship lands among
the magical Lotus-eaters,

07:54.070 --> 07:57.110
where travellers eat fruits,
and lose thoughts of home.

07:59.090 --> 08:00.580
- We get it.
- It's like Corfu, yes.

08:00.610 --> 08:04.030
Where's Leslie? He's supposed
to be doing the stage management.

08:04.070 --> 08:07.190
- Er, Luga. Where did you get these?
- I borrow them.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.800
- We have actors in my family.
- Well, that's fabulous.

08:10.830 --> 08:11.850
No.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.750
- Nikos must be in the play.
- Must?

08:35.780 --> 08:38.900
- Yes, I will do the music.
- He's really musical.

08:48.950 --> 08:51.900
Well, we can... we can work on that.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.930
Oh by the way congratulations
on your forthcoming union.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.950
Ah, The Durrells Players, back,
despite popular demand.

09:01.770 --> 09:02.820
And you're in it, too.

09:02.850 --> 09:04.870
Sven has agreed and your husband.

09:04.910 --> 09:07.790
Oh he'll love that. What parts?

09:07.990 --> 09:10.070
- You, a Siren.
- Obviously.

09:10.140 --> 09:14.070
- And the Wind God your husband.
- Oh you've heard about him then.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.140
Spiros, we've missed you.

09:35.030 --> 09:38.020
I really wasn't pushing
you away from your wife.

09:39.010 --> 09:43.150
Marriage is, well as we know,
it's precious.

09:44.180 --> 09:48.980
Well, I'm realising
that even precious things end.

09:50.100 --> 09:55.970
We all love a sunset, but only a fool
tries to chase it around the world.

09:57.020 --> 09:59.170
Hark at you with your nature metaphors.

10:00.180 --> 10:07.020
Mrs Durrells, you deserve the finest
everything, including language.

10:09.030 --> 10:13.970
I'm going to ask you formally
and for ever

10:15.060 --> 10:17.040
to call me by my first name.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.080
Louisa.

10:23.170 --> 10:25.010
Louisa...

10:27.000 --> 10:28.030
Louisa...

10:30.130 --> 10:35.060
- What does it mean?
- I believe it means famous warrior.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.100
Worrier?

10:38.010 --> 10:39.020
Warrior.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.180
I am Spiridon.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.980
Meaning a basket for carrying seeds.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.020
Mr Hakiaopulos is "needed on stage".

10:57.050 --> 10:58.090
I'm in your play?

10:59.030 --> 11:00.980
All are. There is no escape.

11:01.130 --> 11:02.160
Let's go, let's go!

11:02.190 --> 11:04.180
Whose idea was it
to put me now to perform?

11:04.210 --> 11:08.010
Mrs Durrell, while you're alone,
might I have a word?

11:08.360 --> 11:14.130
Theo, try as you may with your grave
face, you cannot dent my sunny mood.

11:14.280 --> 11:19.190
My friends in Athens say the political
situation in Greece is, is dire.

11:19.270 --> 11:20.850
Pressures in Europe are mounting.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.570
Well we're not leaving
until we absolutely have to, if ever.

11:23.670 --> 11:26.230
Well, I'm glad, but I had to say it.

11:27.340 --> 11:31.250
I don't want to break Gerry's heart
but he should dismantle his zoo.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.300
No...

11:33.230 --> 11:37.290
Otherwise if the worst happens he may
have to just abandon his animals.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.330
Look at me: I'm sorry, but you must be
ready to go if things change.

11:53.470 --> 11:58.520
Signore Mussolini and Herr Hitler
have pledged not to invade Greece

11:59.480 --> 12:04.420
which remains officially neutral under
its Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas.

12:05.410 --> 12:10.390
But the Italian invasion of Albania
has cast doubt on these assurances...

12:16.430 --> 12:17.440
Gerry.

12:17.540 --> 12:18.570
Theo.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.350
- I don't want to have to say this.
- That's just what I said to Larry.

12:22.380 --> 12:25.390
"Woe and thrice woe!"?
Nobody says that.

12:25.550 --> 12:29.360
I suggested "Bloody hell, nightmare!"

12:30.500 --> 12:34.590
But I was thinking...
you might thin out your zoo a little.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.390
What? Why?

12:39.580 --> 12:41.360
Because...

12:44.400 --> 12:47.400
I suddenly thought
it was looking rather crowded.

12:48.380 --> 12:50.430
Well that's just because
you live alone.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.430
You could move a dozen wildebeests
into your place

12:52.460 --> 12:55.520
and you'd hardly notice,
apart from the broken furniture.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.510
Well, good one!

12:58.510 --> 13:01.460
Some might need to spread their wings,
while they can,

13:01.490 --> 13:03.550
however much
we'd like to keep them here.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.590
LUNAR AND SEX WORSHIP

13:15.550 --> 13:18.500
- What's your problem?
- I have to make a mask for a Cyclops.

13:18.530 --> 13:22.450
He's only got one eye, apparently.
Ridiculous. You should be doing this.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.530
I'm busy,

13:23.560 --> 13:27.530
I'm researching how girls around
the world celebrate becoming a woman.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.580
There's a lot about being watched by
the village, which we won't be doing.

13:31.380 --> 13:36.380
I think I'll keep it simple: incense,
white robes before, red robes after.

13:36.430 --> 13:38.390
Yeah, do what you feel's best.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.630
Good luck you two.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.480
Hang onto your hats!

13:45.560 --> 13:48.440
Shall I bring you some prophylactics
from the surgery?

13:48.470 --> 13:51.390
No, I borrowed some.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.550
You borrowed some?

13:58.380 --> 13:59.430
Right!

14:06.410 --> 14:08.520
Right Spiros, let's see how this looks.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.380
Larry?

14:14.670 --> 14:16.440
How do I look?

14:19.460 --> 14:22.580
I've done the best I can with
my limited knowledge and interest!

14:25.490 --> 14:29.520
A visit from the Corfu police,
always a pleasure. I hope.

14:29.570 --> 14:30.620
Hello, everyone.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.640
- Leslie.
- Lambros.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.500
- I see you've been promoted.
- Yes.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.650
Time to be a serious policeman
at these serious times.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.600
In the name of the Greek government I
order you to surrender your wirelesses.

14:44.630 --> 14:47.540
- Why should we give you our...
- We don't have a wireless.

14:47.570 --> 14:49.570
Aren't you a bit tiny to be a copper?

14:50.610 --> 14:51.630
I know you do.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.490
And I will come back tomorrow for it.

14:56.470 --> 14:57.520
Or you risk prison.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.540
Yes, do they not have a minimum height
requirement in the Corfu Police?

15:06.580 --> 15:08.600
No, nor maximum stupidity.

15:08.630 --> 15:10.460
Oh, alright.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.620
He's just doing his job.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.680
I will take this.
It is also for propaganda.

15:20.450 --> 15:23.570
Oh Larry, how will you survive
without your typewriter?

15:23.600 --> 15:26.500
Some things are more important
even than writing.

15:26.530 --> 15:28.490
But, this is all worse than I thought.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.470
The Greek regime has maintained

15:30.500 --> 15:34.410
a vigorous anti-Communist stance
in recent years,

15:34.460 --> 15:37.600
but accusations of fascist sympathies
have been denied.

15:39.470 --> 15:43.400
In Germany, members of the Hitler youth
have been instructed

15:43.440 --> 15:45.550
they may not eat
ice creams in public.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.520
Ah Nikos.

15:55.500 --> 16:00.410
I think tomorrow might be our night,
don't you think, after the play?

16:00.620 --> 16:03.610
A breathtaking encore.
Cast of two.

16:04.610 --> 16:07.590
You told everyone you are
giving me your maidenhead.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.540
No, maidenhood.

16:11.410 --> 16:13.480
Maidenhead is in Berkshire, I think.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.420
I only told my mother.

16:17.550 --> 16:18.640
And Leslie.

16:19.560 --> 16:20.580
And Florence.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.650
And the egg-woman at the market.

16:25.490 --> 16:27.570
You're right I did tell
a lot of people.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.520
- Break a leg!
- Theo, don't.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.680
I'm regretting going public
about the whole virginity thing.

16:34.710 --> 16:37.560
It is quite rare that it's
publicised in advance.

16:37.590 --> 16:38.600
Is it?

16:40.690 --> 16:45.630
Margo, I've hidden the wireless.
So if the police arrive at the house,

16:45.660 --> 16:48.540
stick to the idea
that we've never had one.

16:48.620 --> 16:51.710
- We've never had a house?
- Never had a wireless.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.690
I thought you said
you'd become more mature.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.710
Yes, I'm wondering about that now.

16:56.490 --> 16:58.610
More theatre things.
From my family.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.710
Woeful timing but I have to go, so
I'm leaving you in charge of the play.

17:05.579 --> 17:06.579
Me?

17:06.609 --> 17:10.560
Yes, don't do
the I'm just a dim bloke routine.

17:10.619 --> 17:13.630
You're as bright as anyone here.
I'll be back soon.

17:15.710 --> 17:18.660
This is silly
but he's normally such a bastard.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.410
It's a lovely day.

17:34.350 --> 17:36.340
That is not relevant.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.200
What are my orders?

17:43.440 --> 17:47.250
You want me to do this because
it's looking bad out there, isn't it?

17:49.330 --> 17:50.330
Yes.

17:54.250 --> 17:56.360
You've been so good to me, Theo.

17:59.330 --> 18:02.320
But who knows, I'm a member
of the Optimists Club.

18:02.370 --> 18:03.400
They're all in it.

18:06.270 --> 18:09.200
I'm trying to see it
as setting them all free,

18:09.240 --> 18:11.430
but it feels more like
losing a lot of friends.

18:12.220 --> 18:13.230
I know.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.300
Galini will be so upset
when she finds out.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.340
And all our visitors.

18:19.420 --> 18:23.270
You've passed your enthusiasm
on to so many people.

18:23.390 --> 18:27.220
It's been a huge celebration
of animal life.

18:32.340 --> 18:35.380
So, some are ready
to go back into the wild.

18:35.410 --> 18:38.240
And others need human homes.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.250
Don't worry, Roger.
You're family.

19:39.270 --> 19:40.360
Plays are brilliant.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.300
Oh we should get a good audience,

19:43.330 --> 19:46.240
I asked Argos the Gobby Postman
to tell everyone.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.440
They know the play's in English?

19:48.220 --> 19:51.330
Yes, I said we'd do big
self-explanatory gestures.

19:55.290 --> 20:00.360
You go back to England or not?

20:02.310 --> 20:04.200
Not, Lugaretzia.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.250
Nikos.

20:19.270 --> 20:20.270
I'm sorry.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.200
I made you look like
a performing monkey

20:23.230 --> 20:28.310
and turned a private moment
into, well, a minor local event.

20:29.400 --> 20:35.270
You're right, making love for the first
time should be natural and spontaneous.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.280
Thank you.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.240
So let's not go ahead with it.

20:53.270 --> 20:56.340
First off, I wanna
get this attached to that wall.

20:57.260 --> 20:59.320
Come on, I could do with some help.

21:00.290 --> 21:01.310
Mother...

21:01.340 --> 21:05.270
I've decided to call off the, you
know, shenanigans, with Nikos.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.280
You were right,
maybe we should be really in love.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.370
Like you and Spiros.

21:09.430 --> 21:11.350
Oh, is it that obvious?

21:12.230 --> 21:13.250
Yes, it is.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.330
Well good, so you'll save yourself
for your wedding night.

21:17.390 --> 21:18.440
I will if you will...

21:21.340 --> 21:24.380
Can i have all actors
for rehearsal, please!

21:25.410 --> 21:28.210
Now God is missing so we'll be starting
with scene six,

21:28.240 --> 21:29.430
in which the sorceress Circe...

21:30.210 --> 21:31.290
I prefer Wise Woman.

21:31.320 --> 21:35.260
Er, not interested, when she turns
Odysseus's crew into pigs.

21:36.260 --> 21:37.390
Oh, Galini, perfect timing.

21:37.420 --> 21:40.330
You could be Gerry,
get ready to be turned into a pig.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.320
Now the meaning of this scene

21:42.370 --> 21:47.250
is that health provision on Corfu
is decidedly patchy

21:47.280 --> 21:51.330
but Florence at the surgery
has been a godsend in that she...

21:51.360 --> 21:53.340
No time for meaning.
From the top.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.220
Good morning.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.380
I have come to confiscate
your wireless.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.380
We told you, we haven't got one.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.440
But we could all sing you a song
if you're after a little light music.

22:08.290 --> 22:11.300
The time for joking is over.

22:20.230 --> 22:24.290
Perhaps I should stop your play,
as it is also propaganda.

22:24.430 --> 22:29.220
You stop this right now. I know
your family, they are good people.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.330
Do you want everyone to know
about your medical records?

22:31.360 --> 22:34.440
Do you want me to arrest you
for threatening a police officer?

22:35.390 --> 22:38.320
You'd be superb if you fancied a part.

22:39.350 --> 22:42.330
No, my part is: police officer.

22:43.350 --> 22:47.410
Well I'm sure you are
due an afternoon off.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.220
- Oh, divine.
- That's it! That is spot on!

22:55.270 --> 22:56.340
That's special.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.260
- Thank you.
- What a handsome man!

22:59.440 --> 23:03.230
- Maybe just a little higher there!
- Yes, do you want me to take it up?

23:03.260 --> 23:04.260
Would you do that?

23:09.280 --> 23:10.300
Louisa.

23:13.430 --> 23:15.240
Let's go for a drive.

23:15.420 --> 23:18.360
And when I say drive,
I don't mean drive.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.270
We can't, I'm in a play.
And so are you.

23:22.370 --> 23:23.410
Oh yes.

23:27.290 --> 23:28.290
But afterwards.

23:29.340 --> 23:30.440
Where do you want to go?

23:32.400 --> 23:33.400
To heaven.

23:34.420 --> 23:35.420
I know the way.

23:38.420 --> 23:41.250
- Good afternoon.
- The same to you.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.210
A telegram.

23:53.330 --> 23:54.370
What has happened?

23:56.250 --> 23:57.260
What's wrong?

23:58.440 --> 24:01.440
Go, go inside darling,
I'll be in in a moment.

24:02.350 --> 24:03.410
Go on!

24:11.340 --> 24:15.210
Basil's been killed, in Albania.

24:17.310 --> 24:19.260
Just for being English.

24:20.550 --> 24:21.590
Oh goodness.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.500
"Always take the scenic route,"
he said.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.620
"What's the hurry?"

24:28.590 --> 24:30.490
Now I think there is a hurry.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.640
You must take your family
back to England.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.840
Basil didn't understand the risks.

24:54.930 --> 24:56.690
So now we do.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.840
I'm afraid we have to leave Corfu.

25:00.870 --> 25:04.840
I've been told there's a special
chartered ship that leaves tomorrow.

25:06.850 --> 25:07.880
The safe way back.

25:09.910 --> 25:12.880
I don't think the play's really
the thing now, do you?

25:13.780 --> 25:15.800
We've got lots of decisions
to make quickly,

25:15.830 --> 25:18.880
and well a lot of goodbyes
to get through.

25:22.780 --> 25:25.550
No, we should do the play.

25:25.760 --> 25:31.290
It was always a celebration of our
time here, now it means even more.

25:46.870 --> 25:47.890
Come with us.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.830
You loved America, you'll love England.

25:51.740 --> 25:52.880
We still have a future.

25:53.890 --> 25:55.730
You don't have much time.

25:55.930 --> 26:00.780
Go in, make everyone happy,
the way you made me happy.

26:25.660 --> 26:28.650
Ok, so this is the 'Land Of The Dead'
scene in which...

26:28.690 --> 26:33.760
Odysseus is visited by his deceased
loved ones and heroes from the past.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.870
Come on dear, self-immersion
is never attractive.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.800
You have a family to whip into shape.

26:53.710 --> 26:59.720
I know it's sad to be leaving but we
all roll on, don't we, alive or dead.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.880
Who am I playing?

27:04.690 --> 27:07.880
I do a very good wild boar impression,
if that can be squeezed in.

27:11.750 --> 27:12.770
Mother?

27:24.780 --> 27:26.750
Leslie, you should be the hero.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.120
It was always your part.

27:32.290 --> 27:34.140
You'll be fabulous.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.170
It looks like it could be the last
evening in Corfu for some of us here,

27:49.200 --> 27:50.220
so...

27:52.140 --> 27:53.320
Well, let's enjoy it, shall we?

28:27.080 --> 28:29.200
Why does the play make you
so nervous?

28:30.120 --> 28:31.280
You're all so artistic.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.190
I see a...

28:33.300 --> 28:35.320
tree and you lot see...

28:36.110 --> 28:37.120
Broccoli.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.150
What?

28:38.180 --> 28:40.270
Trees look like upside-down broccoli.

28:44.210 --> 28:47.100
Think of all you've done
since we came here.

28:47.140 --> 28:49.210
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.270
I can't.

28:51.140 --> 28:54.170
I can't even have Daphne,
I still miss her.

28:57.090 --> 28:58.170
I'm quite nostalgic.

28:59.090 --> 29:01.150
Even for Aunt Hermione.
And your Zoltan.

29:02.170 --> 29:03.220
Me too actually.

29:05.110 --> 29:08.260
I wrote to him saying I have
a boyfriend and it's becoming serious,

29:09.120 --> 29:13.220
and hoping he had a nice girlfriend
but not meaning it.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.220
Mother and Spiros seemed very upset.

29:21.140 --> 29:22.150
Yeah.

29:23.110 --> 29:25.310
Adults can be very ploddy
at getting what they want.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.100
I know.

29:27.260 --> 29:30.280
I told mother to go and find Spiros
on the beach.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.350
What's that noise?

29:35.320 --> 29:37.240
The house... breathing.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.340
We know it so well.

29:42.350 --> 29:44.360
It feels like a living thing.

30:26.270 --> 30:28.250
I, I am Odysseus...

30:28.590 --> 30:31.640
- This is a dream come true for me.
- He loves the amateur theatre.

30:31.670 --> 30:36.540
At medical school my Hippolytus
made the audience weep openly.

30:36.590 --> 30:39.590
- Anyone surprised by that?
- Where have you been, Larry?

30:39.670 --> 30:41.590
Shall we do warm-up vocals?

30:41.690 --> 30:43.720
Extremely white stone.
Come on darling, join in.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.620
Extremely white stone.

30:45.650 --> 30:47.740
Extremely white stone.

30:49.630 --> 30:50.690
How are you feeling?

30:50.730 --> 30:52.550
I don't want to leave.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.590
I keep thinking about Zoltan.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.710
Where does Turkey stand in the war?

30:58.590 --> 31:00.710
I...
I don't know anything about the war.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.570
What is it?

31:53.570 --> 31:54.590
I am Odysseus...

31:54.650 --> 31:57.540
I am Odysseus.

31:59.590 --> 32:01.750
Come from across the sea.

32:02.630 --> 32:05.550
- Fearing nobody...
- And ready for all...

32:05.580 --> 32:06.690
And ready...

32:07.690 --> 32:08.710
...for all.

32:09.570 --> 32:10.630
And we the crew.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.720
Willing and devoted.

32:14.520 --> 32:17.600
This island is lush and fine.

32:17.630 --> 32:18.640
Better.

32:19.610 --> 32:22.560
Luga, mask down.
Here.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.740
- No, no, no, no, Luga...
- Here is a native...

32:29.430 --> 32:30.450
Go on!

32:30.480 --> 32:33.570
How strange and exotic she is, to us.

32:34.550 --> 32:41.500
Welcome to the land
of the Lotus-eaters.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.570
- What the heck is she saying?
- I don't know.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.620
We must learn this beautiful language.

32:53.490 --> 32:56.610
Be circumspect in this new land.

34:22.429 --> 34:23.429
I love you.

34:24.420 --> 34:25.440
I love you.

34:29.429 --> 34:32.620
I wish it could just be us together
on this desert island.

34:33.590 --> 34:35.489
I'll need a log cabin.

34:36.460 --> 34:41.449
And a bed, for us, not too big,
so that we're always touching.

34:45.540 --> 34:47.449
I can't go with you to England.

34:48.449 --> 34:50.489
No, you must. You can.

34:50.590 --> 34:54.400
I cannot abandon my children
and my country, now of all times.

34:54.590 --> 34:55.600
No.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.470
What will I do without you?

35:10.590 --> 35:12.440
What you did before.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.450
You'll be beautiful and complicated.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.640
And a mother to your wonderful
peculiar children.

35:28.580 --> 35:30.540
What will I do without you?

35:33.200 --> 35:38.090
You'll go on spreading your magic,
and I won't be here.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.080
You will be here.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.090
Has it all been for nothing,

35:56.180 --> 36:00.070
the waiting,
the crying and the longing?

36:04.190 --> 36:07.150
Would you change it
for us never having met?

36:48.610 --> 36:50.750
- Sven!
- Sven?

36:59.360 --> 37:02.250
Are you having a good time?

37:04.280 --> 37:05.350
Not as good as me!

37:11.310 --> 37:13.440
It's a comic interlude
by a priapic satyr!

37:14.360 --> 37:16.420
Representing sexy Corfu.

37:18.380 --> 37:20.450
It's allowed, it's in Sophocles!

37:21.430 --> 37:22.470
Margo!

37:24.390 --> 37:25.430
Margo!

37:27.290 --> 37:28.320
Margo!

37:29.320 --> 37:30.390
Wait for me!

37:31.310 --> 37:33.410
Oh my God, it's Zoltan.

37:34.940 --> 37:35.970
Behold!

37:36.080 --> 37:37.120
Zoltan!

37:37.150 --> 37:38.920
Poseidon!

37:39.070 --> 37:40.150
Margo!

37:40.960 --> 37:41.990
Zoltan!

37:42.020 --> 37:44.080
Come timely from the sea...

37:44.110 --> 37:46.080
- Good work.
- Thank you.

37:47.130 --> 37:49.100
You stopped the boat too soon.

37:49.130 --> 37:52.140
I am not a fish.
I want to make a dignified entrance.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.110
Sorry!
Problem with the engine.

37:57.050 --> 38:00.920
Margo, I hope I'm not too late.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.020
Come on, in God's name.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.020
Zoltan!

38:30.090 --> 38:32.160
Don't give yourself to another man.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.020
I am here now.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.440
And that's the interval.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.440
Slowly introduce them into the wild.

39:03.330 --> 39:04.400
Please take him home with you.

39:04.430 --> 39:06.560
They love strawberries
more than life itself.

39:07.420 --> 39:10.430
Please don't eat them, use their
eggs, or just take them for walks?

39:10.460 --> 39:12.450
Gerry, find a nice home for Martha.

39:13.420 --> 39:14.440
That's for you, sir.

39:19.430 --> 39:20.530
Years passed.

39:21.420 --> 39:23.430
Youths became men.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.430
- Sorry.
- In your own time.

39:25.520 --> 39:30.320
And men became warriors.

39:36.460 --> 39:37.540
Have you two been...?

39:38.550 --> 39:41.490
- That was quick.
- I'm saying nothing.

39:42.410 --> 39:43.510
I'll never be the same.

39:48.350 --> 39:50.340
Adventures blossomed.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.540
Wild creatures were tamed.

40:01.320 --> 40:05.350
And lost affections
were borne bravely...

40:06.520 --> 40:09.490
How many great loves are we allowed
in this lifetime?

40:11.340 --> 40:12.370
Three?

40:12.480 --> 40:13.540
Five?

40:15.440 --> 40:16.490
Or just one?

40:23.440 --> 40:25.410
Or maybe it's more like a dozen.

40:28.520 --> 40:29.550
Bloody actors.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.410
Mum!

40:36.910 --> 40:38.680
Come on.

40:39.730 --> 40:40.740
Mum!

40:48.710 --> 40:49.790
As you're all here...

40:51.850 --> 40:55.730
Tomorrow we leave this enchanted isle.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.870
You know it's been good
when the idea of leaving

40:59.920 --> 41:01.860
makes your heart seem to stop.

41:02.710 --> 41:03.710
Hear-hear.

41:07.920 --> 41:11.990
You have put up with us Durrells
like a mother with an awkward baby.

41:12.930 --> 41:16.780
You've lost your temper with us
at times, and we with you,

41:16.890 --> 41:18.910
and now we're ready to leave home.

41:20.910 --> 41:24.940
We British are reluctant to Europeans.

41:26.830 --> 41:28.780
But if there has to be a war,

41:29.880 --> 41:31.800
my one wish is,

41:32.900 --> 41:35.780
is that we realise, when it's all over,

41:36.700 --> 41:40.690
that we need to love each other
just a little bit more.

41:42.810 --> 41:46.850
I'm afraid I haven't been following
the play, owing to a personal matter.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.880
But I hear it's very good,
so thank you, Larry.

41:50.750 --> 41:51.880
Oh, and do read my novels.

41:59.710 --> 42:05.680
And it's a perfect reminder that
for us this has been quite a journey.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.820
Bit like the Odyssey.
But nicer people.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.910
Speaking of the Odyssey.
Come on...

42:19.730 --> 42:25.730
And so the crew set sail, but soon
heard eerie and seductive singing...

42:38.690 --> 42:40.820
I can't believe it's our last day here.

42:40.850 --> 42:43.810
Can we now, of all times,
enjoy the present?

42:46.940 --> 42:49.830
Well that's killed the conversation.

42:49.860 --> 42:53.760
- How is Nikos bearing up?
- Zoltan's taken him out for a drink.

42:53.910 --> 42:55.880
I think I handled it quite badly.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.860
There's been a lot of messy
love since we got here.

43:08.810 --> 43:09.830
Noisy.

43:10.840 --> 43:13.860
Thank you for being so grown-up
about your animals, Gerry.

43:13.890 --> 43:17.760
He tell me he will get them back
in the morning and put on boat.

43:17.790 --> 43:18.940
- Gerry.
- Not all of them.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.770
Alright, conquering hero?

43:22.730 --> 43:25.760
Could be worse, as we're about
to swap Paradise for Bournemouth.

43:25.790 --> 43:26.840
Oh shush.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.870
Leslie, you were magnificent.

43:30.760 --> 43:32.740
- Very well done.
- You were brilliant, Les.

43:32.780 --> 43:33.790
Thank you.

43:35.910 --> 43:40.760
I can't find a good way
of saying this, but...

43:41.800 --> 43:44.930
I'm not coming with you.
I'm staying here on Corfu.

43:45.840 --> 43:46.850
Well why?

43:47.750 --> 43:53.860
I spent some time today with
an associate who has a business...

43:54.870 --> 43:57.930
Oh sod it, with a spy,
my intelligence contact.

43:59.810 --> 44:01.860
Is that why we're sitting
in the sea, so nobody else can hear?

44:01.890 --> 44:05.720
No, because it's too bloody hot.
It's always too hot in Greece.

44:05.750 --> 44:07.830
I'm looking forward
to frost and a big coat.

44:07.860 --> 44:09.850
Please come home with us, Larry.

44:10.840 --> 44:11.860
I can't.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.740
When they start trying to take away
your freedom of speech,

44:15.770 --> 44:20.940
we have to stop talking,
you know what I mean, and help.

44:22.790 --> 44:23.860
Let's raise a glass.

44:25.740 --> 44:26.890
Not that Gerry, water,

44:30.020 --> 44:34.100
To us all, and these sacred years.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.350
And the future.

44:42.310 --> 44:44.650
- To the future!
- To the sacred years!

44:44.680 --> 44:47.290
Cheers!
