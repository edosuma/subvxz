WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:03.250
I gotta get goin'

00:03.250 --> 00:06.708
a friend of mine

00:08.416 --> 00:11.416
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.000 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.958
I know he's out there

00:24.708 --> 00:28.125
we're so adventurous

00:28.125 --> 00:31.458
and again

00:31.458 --> 00:35.000
and there's nobody home

00:35.000 --> 00:38.416
to count on a friend

00:38.416 --> 00:41.958
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.875 --> 00:45.458
take me, please?

00:45.458 --> 00:48.875
I gotta be there

00:50.750 --> 00:55.166
Winnie the Pooh

01:15.000 --> 01:16.833
Christopher Robin:
Through the
peaceful countryside

01:16.833 --> 01:19.333
raced the
highness' carriage.

01:19.333 --> 01:22.333
Faster and faster
the coachman drove,

01:22.333 --> 01:24.958
for he knew
somewhere out there

01:24.958 --> 01:28.458
waited the most dreaded
bandit of them all,

01:28.458 --> 01:30.583
El Canejo.

01:30.583 --> 01:31.625
Halt!

01:31.625 --> 01:33.333
Yelled the bandit.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.833
Sunday drivers.

01:43.833 --> 01:47.000
This is a hold up.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.083
Snarled El Canejo.

01:49.083 --> 01:52.583
Oh, d-d-d-dear.
Who can save us now?

01:52.583 --> 01:55.416
Have no fear, citizens.

01:55.416 --> 01:59.333
It is I,
the Masked Avenger.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.250
Oh, no. Oh, no!
Not the--

02:01.250 --> 02:02.708
The Masked Avenger!
Oh-oh.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.500
Thank you,
Mr. Avenger.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.500
No need for thanks,
citizens.

02:10.500 --> 02:14.333
Masked Avenger,
away!

02:18.083 --> 02:21.500
Uh, read me another
Masked Offender story,
Christopher Robin.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.083
Please?
Oh, please?

02:24.083 --> 02:25.750
Uh, tomorrow, Tigger.

02:25.750 --> 02:29.208
I'd love to be just like
that Masked Offender.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.458
What a guy.
What a hero.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.083
Just like a Tigger,

02:32.083 --> 02:34.458
on account a
he's the only one.

02:42.208 --> 02:43.583
Very odd.

02:43.583 --> 02:46.500
My own door
won't let me in.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.750
Tigger:
Who is it?

02:50.125 --> 02:51.583
It's me, Piglet.

02:51.583 --> 02:53.708
Tigger: Yeah?
What do you want?

02:55.708 --> 02:57.083
Uh, I live here.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.708
Oh, yeah.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.958
Then you're just the Piglet
I was lookin' for.

03:01.958 --> 03:02.958
Yow!

03:04.583 --> 03:07.000
Say, got any thread?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.875
Um, uh, yes,
over there.

03:09.875 --> 03:12.166
- Scissors?
- Yes, Tigger.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.333
But if you don't mind
my asking--

03:16.875 --> 03:18.458
Hey, can I borrow this?

03:18.458 --> 03:20.125
Oh, no!

03:21.833 --> 03:24.875
Thought they were all
gonna crash, didn't ya?

03:24.875 --> 03:27.250
-

03:30.083 --> 03:32.416
Um, who is it?

03:32.416 --> 03:35.083
Ta-da!

03:35.083 --> 03:36.458
Who are you?

03:36.458 --> 03:38.583
Why, I'm the protector
of the forest.

03:38.583 --> 03:42.125
Champeen of the underdog,
and other household pets.

03:43.458 --> 03:46.458
I wrestle woozles.
I hogtie heffalumps.

03:46.458 --> 03:50.000
I am the
Masked Offender.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.625
And you, citizen,
have the honor of being

03:52.625 --> 03:54.375
my faithful sidekick.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.375
Ooh, really?

03:56.375 --> 03:58.958
You do the really important
side kickey stuff.

03:58.958 --> 04:01.750
Like, uh, uh,
carrying my hero suit.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.625
Oh, thank you.

04:03.625 --> 04:08.583
But you must promise
never to reveal
my true identity.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.833
But I don't know
your true identity.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.333
Why--

04:14.333 --> 04:16.000
It's me, Tigger.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.208
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:18.208 --> 04:20.125
Ohh.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.375
Masked Offender,
away!

04:26.333 --> 04:29.583
I forgot my hat.

04:31.875 --> 04:34.833
No, you never know
where evil lurches.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.708
You gotta keep
your eyes peeled.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.083
Look, faithful sidekick.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.500
An evildoer
sneakin' up on bunny boy.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.166
Quick.
The hero suit.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.000
Yai!

04:47.000 --> 04:49.458
Have no fear,
citizen.

04:49.458 --> 04:52.166
Masked Offender
to the rescue.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.208
What are you doing?

04:57.208 --> 05:00.250
No! No!
My scarecrow!

05:00.250 --> 05:02.875
No need for thanks,
citizen.

05:02.875 --> 05:06.000
Masked Offender,
away!

05:06.000 --> 05:08.250
But-- But--
The crows!

05:08.250 --> 05:11.416
They'll eat everything
in my-- in my--

05:11.416 --> 05:13.500
My garden.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.333
Look,
faithful sidekick.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.416
Gopher's roof is
full of holes.

05:18.416 --> 05:20.375
Do you know
what this means?

05:20.375 --> 05:22.000
Well, um, Masked Offender,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.458
I-I'm not sure
it means anything.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.416
Why, when it rains,
he'll be flooded.

05:26.416 --> 05:28.625
He'll be mudded.
We gotta save him.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.958
Quick.
The hero suit.

05:30.958 --> 05:34.000
Masked Offender
to the rescue.

05:38.958 --> 05:43.208
Say, what's goin' on here,
sonny?

05:43.208 --> 05:46.375
No need for thanks,
citizen.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.708
Masked Offender,
away!

05:48.708 --> 05:54.583
Huh. Who's thankin' you,
you big-- Ahhh!

05:56.166 --> 05:57.875
But, um, Masked Offender,

05:57.875 --> 06:00.625
uh, there's nothing here to--

06:00.625 --> 06:02.375
Nothing to rescue.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.000
Nothin' to rescue?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.625
Then what's that?

06:05.625 --> 06:06.833
Owl's house?

06:06.833 --> 06:08.208
Exacticly.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.500
Obviously, this tree
grew up under it

06:10.500 --> 06:11.875
when Owl
wasn't lookin'.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.583
He's in terrible danger.

06:13.583 --> 06:16.125
Why, if he sleepwalks,
he might fall and bend a beak.

06:16.125 --> 06:19.333
Wh-- Excuse me, Owl,

06:19.333 --> 06:22.166
but were you
planning on moving?

06:22.166 --> 06:24.750
No, Pooh.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.416
Then why are we?

06:30.875 --> 06:34.583
Tigger:
Masked Offender, away!

06:34.583 --> 06:37.000
Rabbit: And then
on top of that,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.166
he fed my garden
to the crows.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.375
Owl:
He destroyed my home.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.000
Gopher:
Yeah, mine, too.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.458
We've got to stop
this Masked Offender.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.375
Uh, uh,
what do you think, Pooh?

06:48.375 --> 06:51.291
- W-- Well--
- I have it.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.958
We'll give him a taste
of his own medicine.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.000
I second the motion.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.458
Yeah. I third
and fourth it.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.500
Oh, d-d-dear.
I must find Tigger.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.375
Rabbit: Oh, a little more
on his head.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.833
Owl: More glue?

07:07.833 --> 07:09.500
And molasses, too.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.166
Wait 'til the
Masked Offender sees this.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.875
Rabbit: Oh, help me,
Masked Offender.

07:15.875 --> 07:18.166
A citizen needs me.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.875
Masked Offender
to the rescue!

07:20.875 --> 07:24.833
Masked Offender,
don't go-o-o-o!

07:24.833 --> 07:27.875
Ta-da!

07:27.875 --> 07:30.000
Ah! Woohoo!
It was horrible.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.583
It's a-- It's a--

07:31.583 --> 07:33.333
Hmm, you don't say.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.625
Hmm, yeah.

07:34.625 --> 07:37.166
It's as big as
a h-h-house!

07:37.166 --> 07:39.708
Really. Hmm,
that is terribibble.

07:39.708 --> 07:44.000
Hoo, it's a-- it's a
whatchamadingle.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.208
A watchamadingle,
huh?

07:46.208 --> 07:48.708
It's back there.

07:48.708 --> 07:51.583
Uh, we're supposed to be
running from it, you see.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.375
He's, uh, so scared,
he's speechless.

07:57.416 --> 07:59.500
Have no fear,
citizens.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.208
The Masked Offender
to the rescue!

08:05.708 --> 08:07.583
Yuck. He's got a face

08:07.583 --> 08:09.875
only a mother watchamadingle
could love.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.708
So you're the bully
that's been bullying
my friends, eh?

08:12.708 --> 08:14.333
All right,
put up your dukes.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.583
Put up your dukes.

08:17.958 --> 08:20.291
Okay, I warned ya.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.583
Masked Offender...

08:22.583 --> 08:23.708
away!

08:25.875 --> 08:27.708
Wait a minute.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.875
Hey! Let me go!
Let me go!

08:33.583 --> 08:37.458
Oh, Masked Offender.
You saved us.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.250
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.583
I'm too late.
Are you all right?

08:54.166 --> 08:56.583
Oh. Tigger!

08:56.583 --> 08:58.875
You're the
Masked Offender?

08:59.708 --> 09:01.250
Not anymore.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.000
I guess you were right,
Piglet.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Nobody wants
a Masked Offender.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.083
Poor Tigger.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.125
Rabbit: Poor Tigger?

09:13.125 --> 09:16.000
Well, even if we
didn't know it was him,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.125
he still ruined
my garden.

09:19.125 --> 09:25.208
This glue
seems to be getting...

09:25.208 --> 09:26.750
gluier.

09:37.375 --> 09:40.833
All: Whoa!

09:40.833 --> 09:43.833
Help, somebody!
Help!

09:43.833 --> 09:45.291
Piglet!

09:45.291 --> 09:47.291
We're stuck!

09:47.291 --> 09:49.625
Tigger!
Tigger, come quickly!

09:49.625 --> 09:51.708
The others are in danger.

09:51.708 --> 09:54.625
It's a job for
the Masked Offender.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.833
Tigger: Sorry, pal.
Nothin' doin'.

09:56.833 --> 09:59.500
B-b-but they need you.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.875
Tigger:
If anybody needs me,
which I doubt,

10:02.875 --> 10:05.583
I'll be in here
for the rest of my life,

10:05.583 --> 10:08.166
if not longer.

10:08.166 --> 10:11.875
Well, they're our friends
and I'm going to help.

10:11.875 --> 10:15.708
Uh, P-P-Piglet away!

10:16.583 --> 10:18.416
Piglet away?

10:18.416 --> 10:19.958
Uh-oh.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.250
Oh, help!

10:21.250 --> 10:23.875
Ohhh!

10:25.833 --> 10:30.458
Masked Offender,
away!

10:30.458 --> 10:33.208
Missed.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.000
All: Whoa!

10:41.458 --> 10:44.083
Well, whaddaya know?

10:44.083 --> 10:48.000
Watchamadingles bounce.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

10:57.458 --> 10:58.583
There ya go, Owl.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.500
Good as new.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.875
Rabbit: You still have to
fix my garden.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.500
Tigger: Oh, yeah.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.000
You know,
it was a lot less work

11:06.000 --> 11:08.583
when I was
the Masked Offender.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.250
Maybe I should
stop bein' a Tigger,

11:10.250 --> 11:11.708
and go full time
bein' a hero.

11:13.083 --> 11:15.708
Uh, Tigger,
remember what happened
last time.

11:15.708 --> 11:18.500
Yeah, you're right,
Piglet.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.875
I guess I'll
keep the hero suit

11:19.875 --> 11:22.291
in mothballs for a while.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.458
But then again,
you never know

11:24.458 --> 11:26.583
when there'll be
a call for...

11:26.583 --> 11:28.458
the Masked Offender!

11:49.458 --> 11:51.583
Yeeow!

11:51.583 --> 11:54.416
- Oh, d-d-dear.
- Hang on tight, Piglet.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.625
- Isn't this fun?
- Hooray!

11:57.625 --> 11:59.958
- Wheee!
- Yahoo!

11:59.958 --> 12:01.833
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Higher. Higher.

12:01.833 --> 12:05.833
Hoo, hoo.
Tallyho!

12:05.833 --> 12:08.333
Sure looks like fun.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.458
Not that I'll
ever have any.

12:11.458 --> 12:14.250
Hey, what's all this racket?

12:16.166 --> 12:20.125
Hey,
watch where you're goin',
you Sunday driver.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.500
Hiya, Gopher.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.458
Uh, don't hiya me,
sonny.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.291
How do you expect a fella
to get any sleep

12:27.291 --> 12:30.000
with all this noise?
Huh!

12:30.000 --> 12:33.750
Don't you people know
it's past your bedtime?

12:33.750 --> 12:35.875
Bedtime?

12:35.875 --> 12:39.291
Whoa!

12:40.458 --> 12:43.291
- Oh, bother!
-

12:43.291 --> 12:45.625
Tiggers need their
beauty sleep too, you know.

12:45.625 --> 12:47.375
Ah-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:47.375 --> 12:49.875
Rabbit: I'm coming back
first thing in the morning

12:49.875 --> 12:52.333
- for my turn.
- Tigger: Me, too.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.708
It's the early bird
that sits on a worm.

12:54.708 --> 12:58.750
Bet even the worm
gets a turn before me.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.166
Tigger: Hey, Piglet.
Better get home, too.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.583
Don't want to be out here
when the light's out.

13:03.583 --> 13:07.000
Woods are full of
bumpeties and spookables.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.708
Spookables?
Oh, dear.

13:09.708 --> 13:11.500
Oh, d-d-d-deary dear.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.708
-

13:20.708 --> 13:24.458
Eerie Voice: Ohhhh!

13:24.458 --> 13:26.458
What was that?

13:35.208 --> 13:38.250
Eerie Voice: Ohhhh!

13:38.250 --> 13:39.583
What was that?

13:39.583 --> 13:41.750
Either the moon's
got termites,

13:41.750 --> 13:44.416
or it's them spookables.

13:44.416 --> 13:47.291
I'd better
investigrate.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.708
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.583
I don't like it
when the night...

13:55.583 --> 13:57.125
squeaks.

13:57.125 --> 14:00.500
Eerie Voice: Ohhhh!

14:00.500 --> 14:02.125
Yike!

14:03.750 --> 14:05.083
What I can't hear
can't hurt me.

14:06.291 --> 14:09.375
Eerie Voice:
Yo-oh-oh-oh!

14:10.250 --> 14:13.291
Oh, n-n-n-no!

14:13.291 --> 14:14.875
Oh, much better.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.875
Now I can't see
or hear it.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.958
B-b-but what if it can
see and hear me?

14:22.208 --> 14:23.833
Help!

14:23.833 --> 14:25.333
Pooooh!

14:26.833 --> 14:29.333
Oh, dear. I have to
get to Pooh's house.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.250
He'll know what to do.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.583
Whoa!

14:36.083 --> 14:38.583
Pooooh!

14:38.583 --> 14:43.125
Hmm.
Somethin' mighty strange
goin' on around here.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.333
Whoa!

14:51.333 --> 14:53.000
Oh, d-d-d--

14:53.000 --> 14:54.833
d-d-d-dear.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.875
A ghost!

15:07.875 --> 15:10.500
- Where? Where?
-

15:16.166 --> 15:19.458
Eerie Voice: Ohhh!

15:19.458 --> 15:21.833
Gasp! A spookable.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.333
No bumpity's gonna get
the drop on me.

15:26.833 --> 15:29.166
Hey, Eeyore,
whatcha doin' out here

15:29.166 --> 15:31.500
actin' all scary like?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.708
Learnin' to swing.

15:33.708 --> 15:36.708
Don't get a chance
during the day.

15:36.708 --> 15:38.625
Oh, the poor guy.

15:38.625 --> 15:41.166
Well, don't worry.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.500
I'll learn you to swing
like a nightingale.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.166
I can hardly wait.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.208
Gopher: Eh, what I
want to know is

15:49.208 --> 15:52.000
how we're supposed to
catch a ghost.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.875
Surprise!

15:53.875 --> 15:57.375
Why, thank you,
Rabbit.

15:57.375 --> 16:00.708
Is it my birthday again
so soon?

16:00.708 --> 16:02.583
No, no, no.

16:02.583 --> 16:05.833
We have to
catch the ghost
by surprise.

16:05.833 --> 16:09.875
I'll surprise him--

16:09.875 --> 16:11.375
With this.

16:12.875 --> 16:17.000
Hoo-hoo. I say,
I do hate to bring this up,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.583
but before we confront
the apparition,

16:19.583 --> 16:22.875
we do have to find him,
don't we?

16:22.875 --> 16:24.083
That's right.

16:24.083 --> 16:28.000
Unless he finds us first.

16:35.708 --> 16:37.875
Since you're havin' trouble
holding onto the swing,

16:37.875 --> 16:40.083
this glue will hold
the swing onto you.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.708
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

16:50.083 --> 16:53.125
I got a sticky feelin'
about this.

16:53.125 --> 16:58.125
One. Two. Three.
Shove!

16:58.125 --> 17:01.958
Ohhhh!

17:01.958 --> 17:05.166
Worked on this end.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.875
Ah-ha! Hey, Eeyore.
I know what the problem is.

17:08.875 --> 17:12.375
Glad somebody does.

17:12.375 --> 17:15.000
It's not your swinging.
It's you landings.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.083
Ha! Them I can fix.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.083
I should be brave.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.458
At least brave enough
to peek out,

17:25.458 --> 17:27.875
and see something
besides my feet.

17:27.875 --> 17:31.125
But suppose I peeked out
and did see something

17:31.125 --> 17:33.291
besides my feet?

17:33.291 --> 17:35.833
Pooooh!

17:36.750 --> 17:38.583
Did you hear that?

17:38.583 --> 17:42.000
It-- it's
the g-g-ghost.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.291
Now is your chance
to surprise it, Rabbit.

17:46.583 --> 17:49.750
Uh, maybe we should just
write it a letter?

17:51.125 --> 17:55.083
I got somethin'
special delivery for it.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.500
Follow me!

18:00.333 --> 18:04.458
Pooh: My, the dark
certainly is...

18:04.458 --> 18:06.458
dark in here.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.458
Piglet: Oh, excuse me.

18:16.458 --> 18:17.833
Owl: Quite all right.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.125
Piglet: Thank you.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.500
All: The ghost!

18:22.625 --> 18:25.708
Pooooh!

18:29.208 --> 18:32.083
- All: The ghost!
- Piglet: Where? Where?

18:35.583 --> 18:38.000
Piglet: Oh, d-d-d-dear!

18:43.500 --> 18:44.875
Pooh Bear?

18:44.875 --> 18:47.458
Why, hello, Piglet.

18:47.458 --> 18:51.833
What were you doing
hiding inside of that ghost?

18:53.583 --> 18:56.208
Piglet: Well, you see,
uh, there was, uh--

18:56.208 --> 18:58.416
- And then--
- Rabbit: Ha! I knew
there were

18:58.416 --> 19:01.333
no such things as ghosts
all the time.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.083
Piglet: Ooh, but there is
a ghost, Rabbit.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.500
I-- I heard it.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.750
Pooh: Yes, Piglet.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.500
And we heard you, too.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.833
Rabbit: Ha! Ghosts.

19:11.833 --> 19:14.166
Ooh, there it is!

19:14.166 --> 19:18.708
Well, looks like we're gonna
investigate after all.

19:18.708 --> 19:21.208
Hmm, you know what
you ought to have?

19:21.208 --> 19:24.375
My stuffing examined.

19:24.375 --> 19:27.708
A head protectorizer.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.291
Wonderful.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.583
There. Now you can know
which way front.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.875
Hold onto your hooves.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.208
Tigger: Ready?

19:37.208 --> 19:40.875
Eeyore: No,
but go ahead anyway.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.750
Tigger: Chaaaaarge!

19:51.083 --> 19:53.708
Come on,
ya scaredy cats.

19:53.708 --> 19:57.583
- Nothin' here but--
-

19:58.416 --> 20:02.375
The g-g-g-g-ghost.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.750
Tigger:
A-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

20:05.875 --> 20:08.708
Hiya, Pooh boy.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.958
What are you guys doin'
out in the darkedy dark?

20:12.291 --> 20:15.250
That's no ghost.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.833
That's Tigger.

20:16.833 --> 20:17.875
Then wh-what's that?

20:19.291 --> 20:22.083
That's what
I'd like to know.

20:23.708 --> 20:26.250
Heeeelp!

20:30.125 --> 20:32.875
Must have been
the wrong cord.

20:35.583 --> 20:36.833
Oh, dear.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.166
Ghost!

20:47.583 --> 20:50.458
Say, what's the matter
with you guys?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.291
All: Look!

20:52.291 --> 20:56.750
Tigger: What, that?
Ha! It's only Eeyore.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.291
Surprise, surprise.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.583
Oh, my. It is Eeyore.

21:01.583 --> 21:04.000
Why, it's Eeyore.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.125
Hoo. I say,
incredible.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.750
So it is.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.500
Gopher: Swell.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.000
Hmph. But what about
my ghost?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.875
No ghost.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.833
Just a donkey swingin' from
the end of his parachute.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.000
Swingin' from the end
of his parachute?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.708
Hey, Eeyore.
You're swingin'!

21:25.708 --> 21:27.875
Hooray for me.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.875
Ha, ha. Yeah.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.875
He came out at night
to practice.

21:31.875 --> 21:35.375
And I was his coach.

21:35.375 --> 21:36.708
Rawrrr.

21:36.708 --> 21:40.000
So there was no ghost
all the time?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.708
Only Eeyore.

21:42.708 --> 21:44.250
And he's a
friendly ghost.

21:46.375 --> 21:49.250
Rabbit: Oh, my, look.

21:49.250 --> 21:52.875
Hoo, I say,
that seems like fun.

21:52.875 --> 21:55.500
Tigger: Yeah. Hey,
wait a minute, donkey boy.

21:55.500 --> 21:58.000
I want a turn.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

21:58.000 --> 22:02.125
Me next. Me next.

22:02.125 --> 22:05.208
Gopher: Say, how about me.

22:05.208 --> 22:08.708
Piglet: Oh, d-d-d-dear.

22:10.416 --> 22:13.708
Pooh: I do hope we're not
going to have to do this

22:13.708 --> 22:16.291
every time
he wants to swing.
