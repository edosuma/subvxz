13:26.306 --> 13:27.762
Ugh! (SPITS)

13:27.849 --> 13:28.884
Sugar free.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.848
(WATER RUNNING)

13:33.188 --> 13:34.428
Disgusting.

13:35.065 --> 13:38.683
I'll check the bathroom.
You keep checking the snacks.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.401
(SIGHS)

13:56.294 --> 13:57.875
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

14:01.925 --> 14:03.131
Greg?

14:03.260 --> 14:07.424
Sorry I didn't call first.
| just flew
back from my conference.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.345
This really isn't...

14:09.433 --> 14:11.424
I need your
medical records,

14:11.560 --> 14:14.097
and the name of your
primary physician.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.264
You remember Mr. Bell?

14:19.943 --> 14:21.934
If I didn't,
lwill now.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.903
You're not dying.

14:27.242 --> 14:30.734
I may have
misled James

14:30.829 --> 14:32.660
by letting him see
a book on cancer.

14:32.789 --> 14:36.247
We did however have
some expectations that
you might call first.

14:36.626 --> 14:37.661
Yeah.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.665
This isn't how
I envisioned you
finding out.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.175
Mr. Bell and l, we're...

14:48.305 --> 14:49.636
Having sex? Got it.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.218
Getting married. Also.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.300
We wanted you to be
the first to know.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.605
(MONITOR BEEPING)

14:59.191 --> 15:01.352
I need 10 milligrams
of benzodiazepine.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.317
Help me hold him down.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.160
I'm putting epilepsy
back on the table.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.659
And I'm taking it off
because it doesn't
explain losing his teeth.

15:20.796 --> 15:23.833
The kid's diabetic.
The periodontitis could be
real but completely unrelated.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.794
A coincidence?
You buying that, House?

15:27.511 --> 15:29.797
Until I hear something
that takes my mind off

15:30.013 --> 15:33.380
the Jurassic schlong that
l was traumatized
by this afternoon.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.507
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.184
Illegal drugs.
Some kind of acid.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.262
His tox screens
were clean.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.472
His apartment wasn't.

15:42.859 --> 15:43.848
We didn't find
any drugs.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.897
Then why am I completely
tripping balls right now?

15:49.825 --> 15:52.692
I am seriously
freaking out here, guys.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.371
Can't you tell?

15:55.705 --> 15:57.161
You pretty much look
the same you always do.

15:57.249 --> 15:59.240
Take your glasses off.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.496
Pupils dilated.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.208
Pulse elevated.

16:10.929 --> 16:11.918
Hallucinating?

16:12.013 --> 16:13.298
lthink so.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.723
Because he's a rabbit.

16:29.489 --> 16:33.277
Oh! I get it.
Because she's his wife.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.027
(SOFTLY)
They flirt a lot.
I've seen things.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.795
And Taub.
Taub is either

16:48.758 --> 16:52.592
a tooth fairy
or Rainbow Brite.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.431
And you?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.556
You're just House.

17:03.607 --> 17:07.316
She ate ice cream
and gummy bears at
the patient's apartment.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.230
One of them
must have been
closed with it.

17:09.321 --> 17:10.436
Go back and
find the drugs.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.108
You two find out
where he bought them

17:12.282 --> 17:16.150
and then MRI his brain,
check for infections,
masses and plaques.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.785
Am I gonna die?

17:18.955 --> 17:21.287
We'll get back
to you on that.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.828
I've been blind since birth.

17:27.964 --> 17:31.627
I thought maybe
if I tried LSD,
I might, you know...

17:32.469 --> 17:34.630
Colors, a shape.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.551
I just wanted
to see something.

17:38.642 --> 17:39.757
How many times?

17:39.976 --> 17:40.965
Maybe five or six.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.601
We need to know where
you bought it so we can
find out what was in it.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.022
I'll find her.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.140
No.Dont

17:50.278 --> 17:51.859
It wasn't Melissa.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.774
I met someone else.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.075
When were you planning
on telling her that?

17:59.162 --> 18:01.153
Before or after you
ask her to marry you?

18:01.706 --> 18:03.788
The ring
isn't for her.

18:04.459 --> 18:05.665
We were on a break.

18:06.127 --> 18:09.335
She wanted me to see
what else was
out there and I did.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.792
I was gonna tell her
the other night,

18:12.342 --> 18:13.548
but I ended up
here instead.

18:13.677 --> 18:15.884
We just need to talk
to the one who
supplied the drugs.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.549
She's on vacation
with her parents.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.471
This is her cell.

18:20.725 --> 18:24.217
I don't want her to
know I'm in the hospital.
She'll only freak out.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.685
That's very
considerate of you.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.181
You think this
is easy for me?

18:29.317 --> 18:31.023
I know I have
to tell Melissa.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.434
Then what's stopping you?

18:32.529 --> 18:33.814
She's still one
of my best friends.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.314
And I don't want
to be alone in here.

18:48.545 --> 18:49.660
You seen your
mother yet?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.039
HOUSE: She's not dying.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.580
She was having
sex with my father.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.210
(SNICKERING)

18:55.844 --> 18:57.584
Ignore her.
She's on acid.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.049
Your father's dead,
House.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.094
Not the dead dad,
the biological dad.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.718
The one I pointed out to you
at the fake father's funeral.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.023
Huh!

19:10.567 --> 19:11.556
Are you sure?

19:12.027 --> 19:15.736
Your only evidence
is that birthmark you
saw when you were 12.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.231
Well, now I've seen two.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.197
We're gonna be one
big crappy family.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.955
Well, that's
great news.

19:32.589 --> 19:36.252
Your mother won't be alone
anymore and you can finally
get to know the guy.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.921
Yes.
That is one option.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.594
Are you saying
you're not even
cunous?

19:42.891 --> 19:43.926
You want to know
what I think?

19:44.309 --> 19:45.970
I think you know the
answer to that question.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.137
You avoid your mother

19:47.270 --> 19:50.103
because she's the one
person whose opinion
you actually care about.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.685
If that was true,
you'd have every
reason to shut up.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.607
I avoid my mother
because she's boring.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.523
That's why you've
been so open and
honest about prison

19:57.614 --> 19:59.229
and marrying
a complete stranger.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.070
why would I care what
some sperm donor does?

20:03.161 --> 20:05.322
You read the guy's book
about three times.

20:05.455 --> 20:09.664
Years ago and it took
three times because
it was so badly written.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.075
(LAUGHS) Oh! I get it.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.508
The kid's a dick.

20:20.762 --> 20:21.842
You've been working
for House for months

20:22.097 --> 20:25.339
and just now
realized that disabled
people can also be dicks?

20:25.642 --> 20:27.849
What he's doing now
to that girl isn't fair.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.592
The break was her idea.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.771
And now she thinks
they're back together.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.934
He's a scared, sick blind kid
who doesn't want to be alone.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.525
You really
don't get that?

20:38.822 --> 20:40.278
ldo.But”

20:43.159 --> 20:45.150
What is it?

20:45.328 --> 20:47.865
Not good news for him.
Or Park.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.624
Where's Park?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.384
(SIGHING) Wilson's
babysitting her.

21:03.513 --> 21:06.300
Talking about the fact
that she could have
permanent brain damage

21:06.391 --> 21:08.302
might bum her trip
out a little bit.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.225
Dark spot doesn't
necessarily equal
brain damage.

21:11.354 --> 21:16.064
It could be a congenital
malformation connected with
his blindness or a tumor.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.352
A clot.

21:17.485 --> 21:20.397
Exactly. We need
to do another scan,
then inject dye...

21:20.530 --> 21:21.861
I said a clot,

21:22.198 --> 21:23.358
not or a clot.

21:24.534 --> 21:28.618
It's a clot.
Cerebral venous
sinus thrombosis.

21:28.705 --> 21:29.740
That'd be
good news for Park,

21:29.873 --> 21:31.659
but I've never seen one
present this large before.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.364
It fits.
When it was smaller,

21:33.501 --> 21:36.038
it caused his
initial disorientation
and hallucinations.

21:36.171 --> 21:38.002
As it grew larger,
the seizures.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.126
If left untreated,
it leads to cerebral
edema and death,

21:41.217 --> 21:42.878
but what causes
that and tooth loss?

21:43.052 --> 21:46.510
Any hyper-coagulable state.
Lupus?

21:48.099 --> 21:51.512
I counter your lupus
with Behcet's syndrome.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.639
No. He doesn't have
any of the earlier
symptoms,

21:53.730 --> 21:56.893
color blindness,
abnormal visual
fields or...

21:58.526 --> 21:59.857
(CHUCKLES)

22:00.570 --> 22:04.028
We've been ignoring his
eyes because he's blind.

22:05.909 --> 22:08.867
If he wasn't before,
he would be by now.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.654
Confirm with an eye exam
and start treatment with
heparin for the clot.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.866
Interferon and steroids
for the Behcet's.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.126
Give me back my teeth!

22:21.090 --> 22:22.250
You're a tooth thief!

22:22.592 --> 22:24.253
No, no, no, stop it!
Stop it!

22:24.552 --> 22:25.962
(EXCLAIMING)

22:26.888 --> 22:27.843
Back on the couch!

22:27.931 --> 22:29.421
What are you doing
to this poor girl?

22:29.599 --> 22:30.634
It's not what it
looks like. She's...

22:31.059 --> 22:32.595
(WILSON GRUNTS)

22:33.603 --> 22:36.094
She's tripping on acid.

22:36.231 --> 22:40.440
Good Lord, man.
That's no way to
treat a bad trip.

22:40.610 --> 22:43.602
Put the chair down.
You'll end up hurting
the poor wee thing.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.658
Hello, darling.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.109
I'm Thomas and this beautiful
creature here is Blythe.

22:51.246 --> 22:53.077
Is there anything
we can do to help you?

22:53.164 --> 22:55.621
That rabbit
stole my teeth.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.953
Of course, he did.
But I'll tell you what
he's done.

22:58.086 --> 23:01.249
He's put them back again
and they're twice as
nice as they used to be.

23:01.339 --> 23:02.795
You can feel them
if you like.

23:07.595 --> 23:08.755
See?

23:08.930 --> 23:11.262
Now why don't we
sit on this nice,
comfy couch,

23:11.349 --> 23:15.342
have a nice cool drink
and talk all about it?
Would you like that?

23:19.357 --> 23:23.646
He's had some
experience with things
like this back in the day.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.940
As I recall,
both of us.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.521
Ah! Not the time
or the place, dear.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.616
See? There you go.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.867
There's no way that
guy's related to you.

23:46.884 --> 23:50.468
There's fresh scarring
and swelling in both fundi
and a bleed on the left.

23:50.555 --> 23:51.670
House was right.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.221
It's Behcet's syndrome.

23:53.474 --> 23:56.136
Give it to me
straight, Doc.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.558
Am I ever gonna
see again?

23:59.022 --> 24:01.729
That's a little out
of our jurisdiction.

24:01.899 --> 24:04.390
We need to wrap
a dressing over your eyes
to keep the light out.

24:04.569 --> 24:06.184
Not really a
problem for me.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.739
You might not see it
but your tissue does.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.856
It'll also help
with the swelling.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.032
I'll leave you
in Dr. Adams'
capable hands.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.914
You think I'm an ass,
don't you?

24:25.715 --> 24:27.831
I can tell
by your breathing.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.257
Either you're
angry or fat.

24:30.637 --> 24:31.877
(SCOFFS)

24:32.096 --> 24:34.087
I think it's unfair
that you're leading
on a woman

24:34.223 --> 24:36.600
who obviously loves
and cares about you.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.466
I love and care
about her, too,

24:38.770 --> 24:41.933
but we just don't work
together as a couple.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.431
You need to
tell her that.

24:44.567 --> 24:45.898
I'm going to,

24:46.235 --> 24:49.568
but I just want to
do it the right way.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.404
I don't want her
to hate me.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.190
When she finds out you
bought an engagement ring
for another woman,

24:54.285 --> 24:57.072
that option is
out the window.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.573
It was going
to be for her.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.822
What changed?

25:00.958 --> 25:02.914
She told me we were
going on a break.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.243
I didn't even get
a say in the matter.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.750
She wanted you to be sure
about your relationship.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.582
I can see how that
would be annoying.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.960
I think I liked it better
when you were just
breathing angrily.

25:18.518 --> 25:23.262
She still sees me as the same
sheltered blind geek
she met in college.

25:23.356 --> 25:27.440
Most of the time she acts
more like my mother
than my girlfriend.

25:27.527 --> 25:32.362
I asked her to marry me.
She tells me I need to date
somebody else first?

25:32.782 --> 25:34.192
I'd rather she
just dumped me.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.282
At least that
I can understand.

25:36.452 --> 25:40.661
So you were hurt so much
you had to marry
the next woman you met?

25:40.832 --> 25:42.868
Julie doesn't
see me as I was,

25:43.126 --> 25:45.333
but for who I am now.

25:45.461 --> 25:49.295
She trusts me
to make my own decisions
and to help her with hers.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.126
For the first time
in my life,

25:52.510 --> 25:56.628
I have somebody
who needs me instead of
the other way around.

26:06.482 --> 26:10.066
She finally fell asleep.
I think she'll be fine
in a couple of hours.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.861
How do you know
abouthandHng
a bad acid trip?

26:13.990 --> 26:16.652
Friends in your
gardening club been
experimenting again?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.816
I was young once.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.746
(LAUGHTER)

26:24.208 --> 26:28.042
A little scrapbook that
Thomas threw together.

26:28.171 --> 26:31.413
He even has
a couple of pictures
of you as a child.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.500
THOMAS: I've known Greg
almost since he was born.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.334
His father and I
were like brothers.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.764
I was a Navy chaplain
in those days.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.013
I left the service
in the late '60s.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.638
I don't think
his dad ever forgave me
for protesting the war.

26:44.729 --> 26:47.015
Of course, if he knew
I got Blythe involved...

26:47.190 --> 26:48.851
You protested
the war? When?

26:49.025 --> 26:52.188
You were a child.
I didn't share my
entire schedule with you.

26:52.361 --> 26:55.444
We knew if we told you,
you'd tell him and
he'd kill us both.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.863
He was a Marine.
That was the
ultimate betrayal.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.694
Penultimate.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.944
Sweetheart, I think
we need to get back
to the hotel.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.704
Wilson, it's been
a real pleasure.

27:10.797 --> 27:11.877
You're right.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.630
Much too formal.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.002
Come here, lad.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.720
We're practically
family now.

27:21.516 --> 27:23.632
We'll see you
boys tonight.

27:24.018 --> 27:26.225
8:00 sharp.
Good.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.517
I invited them
out to dinner.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.689
Told them it
was your idea.

27:35.404 --> 27:36.610
Straw.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.704
I know we agreed
that whatever happened on
break would stay on break

27:47.792 --> 27:50.158
and I don't expect you
to talk about yours.

27:50.628 --> 27:53.836
ljust want you to know
that there was no one else.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.163
(COUGHS)

27:56.843 --> 28:00.461
I missed you so much
I barely even
saw my own friends.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.635
I'm just so glad
it's finally over.
(COUGHING)

28:05.142 --> 28:06.177
Are you okay?

28:08.771 --> 28:10.181
(RETCHING)

28:10.273 --> 28:11.729
What's happening to him?

28:27.206 --> 28:28.321
Is he gonna be okay?

28:28.499 --> 28:31.115
I'm gonna need to discuss
that with my colleagues.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.043
We have to talk.
No,

28:35.256 --> 28:36.792
you need to rest.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.706
I have to tell you

28:39.427 --> 28:40.462
about what happened
on the break.

28:40.553 --> 28:41.713
Later, you just
lie back and relax.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.886
Stop it, Melissa.

28:44.682 --> 28:46.718
Just stop telling me
what I need

28:47.184 --> 28:49.800
and listen
for once, okay?

28:59.280 --> 29:00.315
How are you feeling?

29:00.406 --> 29:01.771
Embarrassed.

29:01.866 --> 29:05.984
I'm still
not sure what was real
or what I hallucinated.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.323
Did you try to kiss me?

29:10.374 --> 29:11.409
What about you?

29:13.294 --> 29:14.909
He's stabilized
for the moment.

29:15.129 --> 29:17.586
JESSICA: Coughing up blood?
That doesn't really change
anything.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.504
Hemoptysis is a
symptom of Behcet's.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.799
TAUB: Except our treatment
should make him
better not worse.

29:21.886 --> 29:23.467
CHI: It could be
doing both.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.755
Our treatment breaks down
his clot in his head like
it's supposed to,

29:26.849 --> 29:30.717
except a piece broke off
and traveled to one of
his arteries in his lungs.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.767
If anything, we need
to increase the heparin

29:32.855 --> 29:35.141
to prevent further
clots from forming.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.483
We do that and he
starts hemorrhaging,

29:36.567 --> 29:37.977
we won't be able
to stop the bleeding.

29:38.069 --> 29:42.278
We don't do that,
the next clot causes a
heart attack or a stroke.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.522
Park's way, he at least
has a shot at living.

29:45.076 --> 29:47.943
CT his lungs to confirm
and up the dose.

29:53.668 --> 29:55.124
She's young
and hot.

29:55.211 --> 29:56.747
She'll bounce back.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.623
82 pounds.

30:02.051 --> 30:04.713
How much weight
I put on when my break
ended the same way.

30:05.846 --> 30:09.464
People were
calling me
Park-ing-Iot.

30:12.853 --> 30:13.933
Mmm.

30:15.106 --> 30:18.143
Almost 9:00.
I think your boy's
gonna stand us up.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.561
No, no.
He'll be here.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.227
THOMAS: He practically
walked in on us having sex.

30:23.614 --> 30:27.357
God, if I saw my mother
doing that, I'd claw
my own eyes out.

30:27.451 --> 30:31.911
Of course, she was nowhere
near as attractive as you.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.489
Horribly fat,
as a matter of fact.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.199
HOUSE: Mother.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.743
Guy sleeping
with my mother.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.746
This is Dominika.
My wife.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.340
DOMINIKA: It's so nice
to be meeting you.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.595
Gregory tells me
that you were born
in Richmond, Virginia,

30:49.724 --> 30:53.182
and your father was a tailor
who stole from his clients.

30:54.520 --> 30:59.139
James has persuaded me
of the value of openness
and honesty in relationships.

31:03.904 --> 31:07.317
We see people with
disabilities all the time.

31:07.408 --> 31:11.697
But seeing and understanding
aren't always the same thing.

31:17.001 --> 31:18.832
Are you talking to me or
writing a Facebook post?

31:18.919 --> 31:22.707
I'm saying we should have
picked up on the degeneration
in his eyes sooner.

31:22.882 --> 31:26.374
We ignored them because
we assumed they weren't
even part of the equation.

31:26.677 --> 31:29.510
I also realized,
intellectually,

31:29.638 --> 31:33.472
I may understand what
it means to be disabled,
but emotionally?

31:33.559 --> 31:34.594
I didn't have a clue.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.643
Apparently,
his girlfriend
didn't either.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.186
So you're back
on his side?

31:39.315 --> 31:41.476
It's not a side,
it's a perspective.

31:41.609 --> 31:45.272
He just wants to be
treated like an adult.
Make his own decisions.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.521
I may not agree
with all of them,

31:48.616 --> 31:51.107
but how the hell
can Ijudge him?

31:51.410 --> 31:54.117
I'm sure that's exactly
what disabled people want.

31:54.205 --> 31:56.116
To be treated like
completely foreign
entities,

31:56.248 --> 31:59.581
incapable of being
judged and understood.

32:03.172 --> 32:04.753
Park was right
about the clot.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.212
Hopefully,
the anticoagulants
keep it from killing him.

32:09.678 --> 32:13.011
So, she gets the couch
on the odd nights,

32:13.099 --> 32:14.760
and I get the
bed on evens.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.182
In exchange for
a federal felony,

32:17.269 --> 32:20.386
she gets a green card
and I get a live-in maid.

32:22.483 --> 32:23.768
Good for you.

32:24.819 --> 32:27.936
The immigration policy in
this country is a travesty.

32:28.072 --> 32:30.779
It forces people
to lie just so nice
people can stay here.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.197
Thank you.

32:32.701 --> 32:33.986
Dad. (CHUCKLES)

32:36.914 --> 32:38.996
I'm grateful
you approve.

32:40.668 --> 32:44.581
You should also know
that I was not in
Africa last year.

32:44.672 --> 32:45.707
You were in jail.

32:46.966 --> 32:50.629
I've been reading the
Princeton Police blotter
ever since you moved here.

32:53.681 --> 32:57.594
And I'm afraid I haven't been
truthful with you either.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.888
And I've wanted
to tell you this
for a very long time.

33:05.901 --> 33:06.936
Thomas and I...

33:08.404 --> 33:11.646
We got married
two months after your
father passed away.

33:11.740 --> 33:12.729
Uh-huh.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.690
You understand,
we didn't want you
to think

33:14.785 --> 33:17.276
we were disrespecting
the memory of your father.

33:20.624 --> 33:24.708
And is there another
secret that you want
to share with me?

33:30.050 --> 33:33.918
There's nothing you
think might be
relevant to my life?

33:34.096 --> 33:36.087
Like what?

33:36.390 --> 33:38.346
I don't know.
Just off the
top of my head,

33:38.434 --> 33:41.176
something like
I DNA-tested my dad

33:41.395 --> 33:43.351
and found
that he was not my
biological father.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.057
You are.
(LAUGHS)

33:46.192 --> 33:47.602
That's impossible.

33:47.776 --> 33:48.811
People lie.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.445
Birthmarks don't.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.110
(U NZIPS)

33:56.702 --> 33:58.818
Oh, my God!

34:00.831 --> 34:02.742
You told me
he was a preemie.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.412
This bloody lunatic
is my son?

34:05.586 --> 34:06.951
He's not a lunatic.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.207
THOMAS: All those years,
you could've told me,
I could've done things.

34:09.298 --> 34:11.710
I could've made
a difference in
the boy's life.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.468
I think we should all
just calm down and...

34:13.636 --> 34:16.969
Look at him sitting there!
A pill-popping sociopath.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.712
If you wanted to
screw up his life,

34:18.807 --> 34:20.388
you couldn't
have done it better.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.556
He's got you there, Mom.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.764
He's one of the most
well-respected
doctors in the world.

34:24.939 --> 34:27.806
He's saved more lives
than you can count.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.808
Now you
apologize to him,

34:30.945 --> 34:34.153
or I swear
you will never see
me again, Thomas.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.481
I can't deal
with this anymore.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.236
He's my son?

34:38.327 --> 34:41.569
I'm gonna have
a bloody breath of fresh air.
That's what I'm doing.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.586
So, who's for dessert?

34:56.387 --> 34:58.673
(GRUNTING)
Somebody help me!

35:00.849 --> 35:04.512
Will,
it's Dr. Adams and Dr. Chase.
We just need to know where...

35:04.603 --> 35:05.979
My eyes! My eyes!

35:06.146 --> 35:08.182
Feels like
it's on fire!

35:10.359 --> 35:11.690
(GRUNTING)

35:19.618 --> 35:22.325
It's not Behcet's. It doesn't
necrotize tissue like this.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.445
I think it's
streptococcus
pyogenes.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.786
Except we've
already treated him with
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.037
It shouldn't be spreading,
it should be dying.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.211
It just means
it's drug resistant.

35:32.339 --> 35:35.297
We need to remove
what's left of his eyes
before gangrene sets in.

35:35.384 --> 35:39.047
It's something that looks
and acts like a bacteria,
but isn't one.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.885
Could be viral.
No, it couldn't.

35:40.973 --> 35:44.340
No evidence of viral markers
in the necrotized tissue.

35:46.061 --> 35:49.394
Let me see that image
you took last night of
the clot in his lung.

35:59.033 --> 36:01.991
That's not a piece of
the clot from his brain.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.697
Thatsthe
point of infection.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.996
Mucormycosis.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.744
He breathed
in the spores.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.909
Must be growing and
spreading ever since.

36:12.046 --> 36:13.752
A fungal infection
spreading this fast?

36:13.839 --> 36:16.501
Kid's a diabetic.
He already has a
compromised immune system.

36:16.592 --> 36:19.584
He's right. This sample from
his eyes is crawling with it.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.054
Treat him with
amphotericin B.

36:22.890 --> 36:25.597
We treated him with
gentamicin when we
thought it was bacterial.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.601
Which means
the dose of amphotericin B
we'll need to cure him

36:28.896 --> 36:30.852
will probably
leave him deaf.

36:31.065 --> 36:35.775
Sorry, stopped listening
after you said, "The dose
we'll need to cure him."

36:45.371 --> 36:47.737
Blind and deaf?

36:49.249 --> 36:51.114
I'd rather be dead.

36:52.586 --> 36:53.871
You will be.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.914
I can live with that.

37:02.805 --> 37:05.091
You never did
get my humor.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.976
There's a chance
your hearing won't
be completely gone.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.482
How much of a chance?

37:18.779 --> 37:21.896
A small one,
but a chance.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.828
(CRYING)

37:30.999 --> 37:32.990
I'm refusing treatment.

37:35.671 --> 37:39.163
You don't know
how hard things are
already for me.

37:41.844 --> 37:43.960
I can't handle any more.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.510
I can't.

37:55.357 --> 37:56.938
Oh! Hi.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.149
I'm here to apologize.

38:00.696 --> 38:05.360
I could have handled
the news with more aplomb.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.454
I have a son.

38:09.663 --> 38:11.028
That's great news!

38:13.041 --> 38:14.656
What else did she
tell you to say?

38:14.835 --> 38:17.827
You're not a lunatic,
you're not a mistake.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.384
I never liked your
friend, my father.

38:25.721 --> 38:28.884
He could be a bit
intense at times.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.046
But unlike you,

38:30.684 --> 38:32.390
I did respect him.

38:35.397 --> 38:36.898
Do you respect
your mother?

38:40.903 --> 38:44.395
Well, we do
have that in common.
And we all love her.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.573
So we don't have
much choice, do we?

38:52.247 --> 38:54.909
Son, see you at dinner.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.095
WiII, it's me.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.936
Let me guess.

39:19.107 --> 39:23.396
The doctor who thinks
I'm an ass wants you
to convince me to live?

39:24.613 --> 39:25.773
Yes.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.575
It won't work.

39:33.747 --> 39:34.782
I know.

39:36.792 --> 39:37.827
So I won't.

39:41.505 --> 39:43.962
Wow. You're that angry.

39:44.967 --> 39:47.629
I've made enough
decisions for you.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.466
This is your life.

39:54.476 --> 39:56.637
Why did you come back?

39:59.481 --> 40:01.472
Because I love you.

40:04.486 --> 40:07.649
And I want to be with you
for as long as I can.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.191
Melissa, I'm so scared.

40:15.497 --> 40:16.828
(CRYING) Me, too.

40:22.963 --> 40:24.624
I'll always love you.

40:29.011 --> 40:30.342
Even if I was deaf?

40:32.681 --> 40:33.670
Even if anything.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.650
MELISSA:
Is it working?

40:55.203 --> 40:57.285
He's still very ill,

40:57.372 --> 41:00.739
but if he keeps responding
the way he has been,
he should be fine.

41:03.045 --> 41:04.706
And his hearing?

41:05.172 --> 41:06.332
It's gone.

41:06.423 --> 41:09.335
We don't know yet
if it'll be permanent.

41:17.559 --> 41:20.096
Melissa,
is that you?

41:20.729 --> 41:23.937
We've been squeezing his hand
once for yes, twice for no.

41:30.364 --> 41:31.774
Can I ask you something?

41:33.533 --> 41:36.070
I'll completely understand
if you squeeze no.

41:43.752 --> 41:44.912
Will you marry me?

41:55.389 --> 41:56.595
Don't leave me
hanging now.

41:56.765 --> 41:57.925
Yes.

41:59.059 --> 42:00.970
Yes! Of course, yes!

42:01.395 --> 42:02.885
I heard that.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.561
You said yes, right?

42:05.649 --> 42:07.105
You said yes.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.446
How long are you gonna
wait until you tell me?

42:19.621 --> 42:22.613
I thought we already
had the Santa Claus talk.

42:23.959 --> 42:27.122
You don't think I saw
you steal Thomas' fork
from the restaurant?

42:27.254 --> 42:28.209
Why would I do that?

42:28.296 --> 42:29.752
For his DNA.

42:30.799 --> 42:32.414
Thats”.

42:32.509 --> 42:33.749
Thats”.

42:36.138 --> 42:37.469
Very observant of you.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.633
See, you are more me
than you pretend.

42:39.975 --> 42:43.513
You had to know for sure.
So you needed proof.

42:45.522 --> 42:49.140
And the fact that
you haven't told me
can only mean...

42:51.361 --> 42:53.477
He isn't your
father either.

43:01.496 --> 43:02.702
I'm sorry.

43:06.376 --> 43:07.661
You know what
that means?

43:07.836 --> 43:09.542
Your mom's a slut?

43:09.963 --> 43:11.123
That.

43:14.718 --> 43:17.835
And she's not as boring
as I thought she was.
