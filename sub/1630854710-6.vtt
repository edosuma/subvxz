00:01.400 --> 00:05.840
In the world today, protecting
a country's borders is vital.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.920
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.480
These are the men
and women in uniform,

00:11.520 --> 00:14.560
responsible for safeguarding
Ireland's borders.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.640
Stopping.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.920
Look at me, behind the
yellow line. Searching.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.576
Have you ever been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.496
Will you just listen to me,
will you just listen to me?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.000
And seizing - drugs
arms and illegal goods.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.920
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.720
Saving lives.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.840
I would say about
200 km per hour.

00:31.880 --> 00:36.040
And protecting Ireland's inhabitants
and millions of visiting tourists.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.256
You could have been here
100 times, it doesn't mean that

00:38.280 --> 00:40.600
you're guaranteed to
get in the 101st time.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.960
They police the ports.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.440
You have to make sure
there's definitely nobody

00:45.480 --> 00:48.440
underneath the
vehicle. The airports.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.120
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

00:50.160 --> 00:51.360
And the roads.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.320
These are very
badly damaged straps.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.120
If you can't drive the truck,

00:55.160 --> 00:56.400
shouldn't be on the road.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.160
These are the
border interceptors.

01:04.720 --> 01:09.640
Coming up... at Shannon airport,
it looks like no visa, no entry.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.200
Will this traveller
be sent packing?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.720
Just get you to
take a seat there.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.896
He could be from the
likes of the Philippines

01:16.920 --> 01:18.760
or far flung
corners of the world.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.960
A driver refuses to
give her true identity.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.680
But what has she got to hide?

01:23.720 --> 01:25.680
Either you're giving
me a false name or...?

01:25.720 --> 01:28.680
I'm not giving you a false
name. Well, I've no match for that.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.400
And Disney arrive in town.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.160
And with it comes a security
lock-down for Dublin port.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.080
Situated off the Atlantic
coastline on the Shannon estuary,

01:44.120 --> 01:47.920
Shannon airport is the gateway
to the south west of Ireland,

01:47.960 --> 01:51.680
giving travellers easy access
to limerick, galway and beyond.

01:53.320 --> 01:56.080
It's the third largest
of Ireland's airports,

01:57.160 --> 02:01.760
with over 1.7 million passengers
travelling through it in 2017.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.480
Maybe next time.
You take care sir.

02:06.520 --> 02:10.520
The airport's busiest routes are
between London, New York and Boston.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.240
So, you're a fiddle player sir?

02:12.280 --> 02:14.400
No, I'm a Piper. Oh,
you're a Piper, are you?

02:14.440 --> 02:18.040
From a security perspective,
the airport has a unique

02:18.080 --> 02:21.280
and vital relationship
with transatlantic flights.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.360
We're the first port of
call here in Shannon for

02:24.400 --> 02:27.680
transatlantic traffic if
they get into difficulty.

02:27.720 --> 02:32.360
They pass that point of no return,
where they can't turn back from

02:32.400 --> 02:36.480
america and they must keep going
to the western seaboard, so we're it.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.920
So, border control
here remains tight.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.000
People attempting
to enter illegally

02:43.040 --> 02:46.320
may find themselves
in a very bad position.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.880
Shannon doesn't have daily
return flights to some of the airports

02:51.920 --> 02:53.760
preferred by would-be
illegal immigrants,

02:53.800 --> 02:56.720
with the result that anyone
that might arrive here illegally

02:56.760 --> 02:58.440
could be looking at up to

02:58.480 --> 03:01.080
a week inside a limerick
prison pending a return flight.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.880
You're with that gang, yeah?

03:07.920 --> 03:09.040
Yeah?

03:11.840 --> 03:13.280
It's estimated that there are

03:13.320 --> 03:17.040
upwards of 26,000
undocumented workers in Ireland.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.600
Ah you're ok girl, you're
ok, there's no panic.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.656
Many are foreign nationals
illegally working in the country.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.400
How ya doing?
Having arrived on tourist

03:26.440 --> 03:29.280
or limited work visas,
and then disappearing.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.880
Thank you.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.840
A non-eu resident has just
flown into Shannon airport,

03:35.880 --> 03:39.880
has arrived at immigration
officer niall kampff's desk.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.280
This is no simple case of stamping
and letting him through, though.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.160
He's carrying an unusual
amount of paperwork,

03:48.200 --> 03:51.520
and of much greater
significance, he doesn't have a visa.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.560
No visa usually means no entry.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.000
I'll tell you I'll just get
you to take a seat there.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.840
I'll call you back
in five minutes.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.160
He's told to take a seat
and can only wait to find out

04:02.200 --> 04:04.720
if he'll be allowed
into the country.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.520
Talk to you in five
minutes. Thank you.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.760
That man behind me now,
that gentleman behind me,

04:11.800 --> 04:13.456
he could be from the
likes of the Philippines

04:13.480 --> 04:16.200
or far flung corners of the world,
we're not too concerned what

04:16.240 --> 04:19.280
country he comes from, as
long as he is who he says he is.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.056
But there's a small bit of
paperwork involved with him,

04:21.080 --> 04:23.216
so I've just put him aside not
to delay the queue too much,

04:23.240 --> 04:24.800
and I'll deal with
him in two minutes.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.280
The entire flight has been processed
and the passenger is still waiting.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.160
He'll have to stay put until
officer kampff is ready to see him.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.360
The passenger is
called back to the desk.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.520
He's got to hope that the
paperwork he's carrying

04:41.560 --> 04:43.960
will be enough to
allow him into Ireland.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.200
How long will
you be staying for?

04:49.200 --> 04:51.680
Welcome back. Thank you.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.040
Now how are you doing?

04:57.640 --> 05:00.560
Officer kampff is aware that
he has arrived in the country

05:00.600 --> 05:01.880
without a visa.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.240
And with no visa,
there's a very real chance

05:08.280 --> 05:09.840
he'll be sending him packing

05:09.880 --> 05:11.360
on the next flight home.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.640
Have you been here before? Yeah.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.840
However, having gone
through his paperwork,

05:16.880 --> 05:20.120
he's identified as a working
international fisherman,

05:20.160 --> 05:22.880
and he's carrying
a seaman's book.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.320
It's a record of his
service working at sea,

05:26.360 --> 05:29.280
and allows him entry into
a country without a visa,

05:29.320 --> 05:31.840
if he's immediately
joining a ship's crew.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.800
Do you know the name of
the ship you're boarding?

05:34.840 --> 05:37.960
Valiant. Oh, the
arklow Valiant? Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.960
Working on ships all his life.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.696
For him to correctly enter
a country with the amount

05:41.720 --> 05:44.200
of visas he'd require, it
would be an impossibility,

05:44.240 --> 05:47.800
or very difficult at least, so
what he has is a seaman's book.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.600
It's a type of a passport
for the high seas.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.760
Seaman's book, passport.
Thank you very much, best of luck.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.960
With all the paperwork done, he
now has 24 hours to join his ship.

06:02.320 --> 06:07.040
Garda traffic officers mcmann and
fay are on patrol around Dublin port,

06:07.080 --> 06:10.120
one of the busiest entry
points to the republic of Ireland.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.520
Attention.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.280
Here it is, what
are we looking at?

06:15.320 --> 06:18.080
Their automatic number
plate recognition system

06:18.120 --> 06:19.560
has raised a flag,

06:19.600 --> 06:21.440
and they head to
intercept the car.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.880
Yeah, it's driving off
from a fuel station.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.920
When was the
warning put on there?

06:28.840 --> 06:32.320
The car has driven off from a
filling station the night before

06:32.360 --> 06:33.560
without paying for goods.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.400
They track it down,
and pull it over.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.240
What we need to find, driver.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.600
Hello. Is this your
own car madam?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.600
It is, yes. What's your name?

06:53.640 --> 06:56.000
Nicola Thompson.
Nicola Thompson? Yeah.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.120
What's your date
of birth Nicola?

06:59.160 --> 07:02.200
28, fifth, 1974.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.680
Nicola, can you tell me who
was driving the car last night?

07:04.720 --> 07:06.120
Around 9:00?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.840
I was. You were?

07:07.880 --> 07:11.520
And the car was up last
night at 9:00 at a filling station.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.520
It left without paying
for wine and for oil.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.480
Do you know anything about that?

07:18.520 --> 07:20.336
Tango bravo two-zero-eight,
control, could you oblige with

07:20.360 --> 07:22.280
a driver look up please.

07:23.480 --> 07:28.400
Surname is Thompson, the date
of birth is the 28 of the fifth, 1974.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.320
Nicola? Yeah?

07:33.360 --> 07:37.080
I'm not getting any match for
any driving licence assigned

07:37.120 --> 07:40.280
to a Nicola Thompson,
the 28th of the fifth 1974.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.360
So, either you're giving
me a false name or...

07:43.400 --> 07:45.040
I'm not giving you
a false name, sir.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.880
Well, I've no match for that.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.376
Anyone who has a
licence in the country,

07:48.400 --> 07:49.440
their details are stored,

07:49.480 --> 07:51.296
and I've looked here and there's
no match for Nicola Thompson

07:51.320 --> 07:54.000
may 28, '74.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.640
May 28, no it's the
ninth of August 1988.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.160
You said the may 28, '74.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.040
You're telling me '88?

08:04.080 --> 08:07.040
It's not 1988, so give me
your correct name and address,

08:07.080 --> 08:08.976
or I'll arrest you and take
you to the garda station

08:09.000 --> 08:10.640
and we'll verify
your details there.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.440
So, give me... pardon me?

08:12.480 --> 08:13.760
Noreen byrns.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.200
Noreen. N-o-r-e-e-n. Yes.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.760
B-y-r-n-s. Yes.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.720
What's your date
of birth Noreen?

08:20.760 --> 08:22.440
28th of the fifth.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.720
28th of the fifth? '71.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.280
'71. One moment please.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.616
Would you mind trying
a different name please,

08:32.640 --> 08:33.920
for the driver look up?

08:36.320 --> 08:37.840
Byrnes. B-y-r-n-e-s.

08:37.880 --> 08:41.520
Date of birth, 28th
of the fifth, 1971.

08:42.680 --> 08:44.640
No, it is supposed
to be a Noreen but...

08:46.520 --> 08:48.480
No match? No match.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.160
Having now been
given two false names,

08:52.200 --> 08:55.800
will the garda ever find
out who the driver really is?

08:59.040 --> 09:02.880
While patrolling the major routes
outside Dublin, linking the city

09:02.920 --> 09:07.120
with the port, airport and the
rest of Ireland, police pulled over

09:07.160 --> 09:10.280
a truck that was driving erratically
and exceeding the speed limit.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.440
The vehicle was
immediately seized,

09:15.480 --> 09:18.080
and the driver charged
with dangerous driving.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.520
But suspecting there is
more going on with this truck

09:20.560 --> 09:21.720
than meets the eye,

09:21.760 --> 09:25.320
the police have now called in
senior transport officer Seamus lynch

09:25.360 --> 09:28.080
from the road safety
authority to investigate.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.640
The driver has to
comply with certain rules,

09:32.680 --> 09:34.376
they're called the
drivers' hours regulations,

09:34.400 --> 09:37.360
so the driver has to
take prescribed breaks,

09:37.400 --> 09:40.640
he's got to take prescribed
daily rest and weekly rest periods,

09:40.680 --> 09:44.800
and he's also restricted to a
certain number of driving hours.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.680
So, the purpose of the
tachograph then basically is to keep

09:47.720 --> 09:50.280
a record of all them breaks,
rest periods and driving times.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.880
By manipulating the tachograph,
they're disguising all of that,

09:53.920 --> 09:55.120
you know.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.760
Office lynch begins his
investigation by printing out

09:59.800 --> 10:02.240
the distance travelled
data from the tachograph,

10:02.280 --> 10:07.200
as well as the recorded engine
speed, but the data doesn't add up.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.840
Now when I look at the
vehicle speed here right?

10:09.880 --> 10:12.640
It's telling me that the
vehicle never moved.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.480
That's fine. The guy could
have been at rest that day.

10:15.520 --> 10:19.800
However, the engine speed
between 600 and 800 revs,

10:19.840 --> 10:21.680
there's a 36-minute
period there,

10:21.720 --> 10:25.000
from 800 to 1000 revs,
we've got 53 minutes.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.680
So, if I add all these up,
compare these two print outs,

10:28.720 --> 10:33.880
the vehicle speed,
zero, for 24 hours,

10:33.920 --> 10:36.120
but this is telling me the
truck was actually moving

10:36.160 --> 10:38.240
for seven hours and 23 minutes.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.680
You know, there's no doubt
there's a device here somewhere.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.240
Officer lynch, suspecting
the vehicle's tachograph

10:44.280 --> 10:48.200
has been illegally tampered
with, decides to take the truck back

10:48.240 --> 10:50.000
on the road to test it.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.216
Our tachograph
is recording the fact

10:51.240 --> 10:53.696
that we're actually driving,
that's what it's supposed to do,

10:53.720 --> 10:57.400
the speedometer is working,
and it's based on the information

10:57.440 --> 11:00.096
we've got from the calibrated
speed gun used by the sergeant here,

11:00.120 --> 11:02.480
it's working correctly.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.960
The two speeds are matching,
and the odometer is recording

11:05.000 --> 11:07.120
the actual distance travelled.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.720
So, I'm happy that
there's no device

11:08.760 --> 11:11.280
being used at the moment
as we're driving this vehicle.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.280
Everything may have
worked correctly in the test,

11:14.320 --> 11:15.880
but officer lynch suspects there

11:15.920 --> 11:18.120
is an illegal and highly
dangerous device

11:18.160 --> 11:19.800
fitted to the vehicle.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.920
Now he needs to find
the device to prove it.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.320
The garda traffic corps
have pulled over a car.

11:32.640 --> 11:36.600
It's suspected of being involved
in a recent shoplifting incident.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.520
With a child in the back seat,

11:39.560 --> 11:42.440
the driver has been in no
hurry to tell the officers the truth,

11:42.480 --> 11:45.880
and they're still trying
to find out her identity.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.560
Have you any ID with you at all?

11:48.600 --> 11:51.880
No, no ID sir. Have
you a bank card or...?

11:51.920 --> 11:55.280
No? Is that medication you have?

11:55.320 --> 11:56.760
In that bag there?

11:57.600 --> 12:00.360
She finally provides
a social security card.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.280
That's the real
thing now is it? Yeah.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.080
Ok, so, third go, yeah.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.440
Been given a social
services card now control,

12:08.480 --> 12:10.680
if you wouldn't mind
trying that for me please.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.960
And there's more to
this woman's story.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.400
She's got previous.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.120
You're just released out of
prison back in November?

12:23.320 --> 12:24.960
What was that for?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.760
What was that for?

12:26.800 --> 12:30.000
Shoplifting...
and 9:00 last night

12:30.040 --> 12:35.120
the car was up shoplifting
wine and... pardon?

12:35.160 --> 12:38.160
Not only has she been inside,
but she shouldn't be driving

12:38.200 --> 12:40.200
the car at all.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.920
There's no licence,
she was disqualified

12:42.960 --> 12:45.200
for ten years back in 2003,

12:45.240 --> 12:47.320
and didn't get a licence since.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.560
We're gonna have to get
someone to come down,

12:49.600 --> 12:52.520
the car's gonna be seized
under section 41, ok?

12:52.560 --> 12:53.896
You've no licence
and no insurance,

12:53.920 --> 12:55.760
you can't have
insurance with no licence.

12:55.800 --> 13:00.720
The woman's desperate, she
tries to bargain with the garda,

13:00.760 --> 13:03.720
tipping them off about a drug
shipment heading for Dublin.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.360
When I say to you I made a deal

13:05.400 --> 13:07.696
and you get with the biggest lot
of heroin the ever came into Dublin.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.840
It's not who you know,
it's what you know.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.560
You don't want a load of
imaginary heroin do you? You sure?

13:19.480 --> 13:22.760
But they're not biting.
The car is being seized.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.016
The woman retrieves her child
and belongings from the vehicle

13:26.040 --> 13:27.520
and leaves on foot.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.920
The cars on its
way to the pound,

13:32.960 --> 13:34.920
another illegal
driver is off the roads,

13:34.960 --> 13:37.960
and the officers can
move on to the next call.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.720
Dublin port is a key entry
point in Ireland's border,

13:46.760 --> 13:49.440
handling almost
50% of all trade.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.800
But, as well as
cargo and ferries,

13:53.840 --> 13:56.280
it's also popular
with cruise liners.

13:57.160 --> 14:02.120
A record 151 cruises were
confirmed for the 2018 season.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.400
Bringing just over
270,000 visitors to Dublin,

14:06.440 --> 14:09.800
and contributing 50 million
Euros to the local economy.

14:13.760 --> 14:18.240
Today, the port is welcoming
the 300m-long Disney magic,

14:18.280 --> 14:21.680
with its 2700 passengers
for the first time.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.520
With the huge ship comes
a massive security operation.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.440
Head of port security, Tom
kavanagh, is overseeing proceedings.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.560
This cruise ship is the Disney
magic and it's the first time

14:57.600 --> 15:01.960
she's been here, and it's a
real, real good thing for us

15:02.000 --> 15:04.520
and for the passengers to
come to Ireland for the first time.

15:04.560 --> 15:08.040
Disney is a global brand and we're
really enjoying having them here.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.176
There's a great atmosphere, it's
an entertainment package for all here

15:10.200 --> 15:11.440
at Dublin port.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.336
There's always a high
level of security on them all,

15:13.360 --> 15:15.760
but this particular one has
come straight from the us,

15:15.800 --> 15:19.080
so the level of security
afforded to this one is incredible.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.840
We're really on the top of our
game for this particular one.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.480
At the entrance to the port,
security officer dermot weldon

15:27.520 --> 15:29.080
is overseeing
checkpoint security.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.560
Every single vehicle coming in

15:32.600 --> 15:35.360
and out of this part of the
port has to be authorised,

15:35.400 --> 15:37.000
either because they work there,

15:37.040 --> 15:39.840
or because of the
cruise ship's arrival.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.840
I've the manifest
here, the visitors' list

15:41.880 --> 15:44.360
so that everybody who's
going visiting that ship,

15:44.400 --> 15:46.720
or going onto that ship
has to be checked with ID

15:46.760 --> 15:48.320
and their name on this list.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.440
If it's not on it, they don't
get in. Simple as that.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.840
No excuses, no exceptions.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.640
For the buses and coaches
which have arrived to pick up

15:58.680 --> 16:01.680
disembarking passengers,
there's extra security checks.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.760
As Dublin port is a
potential high-profile target

16:09.800 --> 16:13.560
for a terrorist attack, the
security team have to be vigilant,

16:13.600 --> 16:16.600
looking out for anything
that might raise suspicion.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.520
Security, whether
you like it or not,

16:21.560 --> 16:22.840
and not everybody likes it,

16:22.880 --> 16:24.760
even if you have an
alarm in your house,

16:24.800 --> 16:26.616
you have to make sure
no-one robs your house,

16:26.640 --> 16:27.856
it's the same with
the cruise liner,

16:27.880 --> 16:29.616
you have to make sure
no-one robs the cruise liner,

16:29.640 --> 16:30.816
no-one blows up
the cruise liner,

16:30.840 --> 16:32.496
no-one's trying to
blow up the cruise liner.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.000
It's all about security.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.160
All the vehicles pass
their security checks,

16:36.200 --> 16:38.560
and on the dock side,
the cruise passengers

16:38.600 --> 16:41.800
can board their buses to go
on excursions around Dublin.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.200
The passengers may have left,

16:46.240 --> 16:48.440
but with the cruise
ship still in port,

16:48.480 --> 16:50.480
security remains
at the highest level.

16:52.640 --> 16:56.920
Disney could be considered a
target for terrorists or subversives,

16:56.960 --> 17:01.680
we will not allow anybody to
cause a problem here in Dublin.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.760
That's what they want
and that's what they get.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.400
So far, everything has gone to
plan, but until the ship leaves,

17:08.440 --> 17:10.800
the security team must
remain on high alert.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.120
Once the passengers
return from their excursions,

17:15.160 --> 17:17.960
the ships sets sail for
the next leg of its journey.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.480
Finally, the security
team can relax,

17:22.520 --> 17:25.760
until the next cruise
liner of the season arrives.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.880
A speeding truck has been seized
by the garda and its driver arrested

17:32.920 --> 17:36.200
for dangerous driving,
but there's also a suspicion

17:36.240 --> 17:40.000
that the truck has been tampered
with to avoid safety regulations.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.600
Road safety authority
officer, Seamus lynch,

17:43.640 --> 17:46.960
has checked the truck's data
and is certain it's fitted with

17:47.000 --> 17:50.720
an illegal device that stops the
tachograph working correctly.

17:50.760 --> 17:55.480
When I compare these two print
outs, the vehicle speed - zero -

17:55.520 --> 17:58.200
but this is telling me that
the truck was actually moving

17:58.240 --> 18:00.520
for seven hours and 23 minutes.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.000
Now, he needs to prove it.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.440
What's probably fitted
to this particular vehicle

18:06.480 --> 18:08.600
is a can bus
manipulation device.

18:08.640 --> 18:11.560
Having come across
these devices before,

18:11.600 --> 18:14.120
officer lynch has an
idea of how it works.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.000
To trigger the device, we've
got to turn the ignition on,

18:17.040 --> 18:18.840
without actually
engaging the engine.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.280
Now Darren if you want to
put your foot on the accelerator,

18:22.320 --> 18:24.880
count to six - one, two, three,

18:24.920 --> 18:28.840
four, five, six - start her.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.960
The device will be activated,
and we will then proceed to drive,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.720
and we'll actually see what effect
does this device have on the truck.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.240
Pulling out there now.

18:40.840 --> 18:45.680
You can clearly see the
tachograph is not recording driving.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.616
We're actually not travelling at
all according to the speedometer,

18:47.640 --> 18:49.320
it's at zero.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.560
Using a quiet stretch of road,

18:55.600 --> 18:57.560
the officer driving
puts his foot down.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.880
We've upped the speed so let's
see what the calibrator gun tells us.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.920
We're now doing 122,
the speed limit is 90.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.800
The driver has no idea
what speed he's driving at.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.040
The speedometer's not
working, so he hasn't a clue.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.600
You've got to bear
in mind this is a truck.

19:17.640 --> 19:22.680
A truck like this can't stop in a
hurry... and usually the people

19:22.720 --> 19:23.720
who use these devices,

19:23.760 --> 19:25.376
they're used for the
purpose of disguising the fact

19:25.400 --> 19:27.736
that they're driven longer
hours than they're supposed to,

19:27.760 --> 19:29.920
they haven't got the required
breaks or rest periods,

19:29.960 --> 19:31.696
so they're more than
likely fatigued drivers,

19:31.720 --> 19:33.880
and the statistics show that

19:33.920 --> 19:36.840
one in five accidents
are caused by fatigue.

19:36.880 --> 19:40.560
It's extremely dangerous and,
you know, I would imagine that

19:40.600 --> 19:43.760
the people who fit these devices
give absolutely no consideration

19:43.800 --> 19:45.240
whatsoever to road safety.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.120
Armed with the evidence that the
tachograph has been tampered with,

19:50.160 --> 19:52.840
officer lynch now
needs to find the device.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.680
His team starts looking
for anything unusual.

19:58.360 --> 20:01.680
And it's not long before they
find what they're looking for.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.880
Is that a black box I see here?

20:05.560 --> 20:09.160
We've seen these before,
auto can bus data log.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.200
Just gonna have
a look inside, ok?

20:12.600 --> 20:15.640
Right, there we have
a printed circuit board.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.360
I'm just going to
try and do a little bit

20:17.400 --> 20:19.360
of a test to turn the
engine on now, ok?

20:19.400 --> 20:21.400
Now if my
suspicions are correct,

20:21.440 --> 20:23.536
I would expect to see a
green light or something else.

20:23.560 --> 20:27.040
Four, five, six...

20:29.960 --> 20:32.640
..There's your green
light, she's now activated.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.240
With his suspicions confirmed,

20:35.280 --> 20:37.560
the evidence officer
lynch has uncovered

20:37.600 --> 20:41.120
will be used to prosecute
the truck's operator and driver.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.080
The haulage industry
is highly competitive,

20:45.120 --> 20:48.920
leading to companies taking
risks to complete the work on time,

20:48.960 --> 20:52.320
but on this occasion, they
haven't got away with it.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.920
They now face a fine
of up to 5000 Euros

20:55.960 --> 20:57.920
and even six months in jail.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.520
It's all down to being motivated
by money at the end of the day,

21:01.560 --> 21:04.680
the more work they carry
out, the more they get paid.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.320
So, you know, I
presume they look

21:06.360 --> 21:07.936
at the tachograph and
drivers' hours regulations

21:07.960 --> 21:09.560
as being too restrictive,

21:09.600 --> 21:11.280
but the problem
with that is obviously

21:11.320 --> 21:15.800
you're compromising road safety
and the conditions for drivers.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.080
These drivers are
often, you know,

21:18.120 --> 21:20.920
made to use these devices
and they're ending up driving

21:20.960 --> 21:22.840
16, 17, 18 hours a
day and not getting

21:22.880 --> 21:24.400
adequate rest periods.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.600
Quite a small
looking device isn't it?

21:26.640 --> 21:29.680
But what it can do can have
pretty serious consequences.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.680
If one wants to consciously
think of road safety,

21:32.720 --> 21:33.976
you wouldn't put
in one of these.
