05:15.639 --> 05:17.482
The swamp excavator is good,
certainly out in the middle,

05:17.641 --> 05:20.402
but if we're doing the edges,
a-a long-reach is better.

05:20.561 --> 05:22.571
What is "long-reach" that
you're thinking? What is that?

05:22.730 --> 05:25.073
It would be 80-foot long-reach.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.067
Hmm. That's pretty good.

05:27.151 --> 05:28.902

- How's it looking?

09:23.312 --> 09:27.223
Well, as you see,
from 82 feet to 89 feet,

09:27.308 --> 09:30.560
quite a substantial section
of stacked timbers here.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.988
- Seems to me it's a shaft wall.
- Yeah.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.491
So, we already know there is
a tunneling system around C-1.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.244
Or, it's the original Money Pit.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.488
We keep getting evidence
of tunnels and shafts that

09:42.573 --> 09:45.575
are totally undocumented
in the C-1 cluster.

09:45.659 --> 09:48.328
<i>So, we're trying to define
what these shafts are</i>

09:48.421 --> 09:50.922

- Yes.

19:25.655 --> 19:27.573

No. Nothing.

- RICK: That's a big stump.
- BILLY: Yeah.

20:01.775 --> 20:04.785
- RICK: How deep was that?
- Four to six.

20:05.946 --> 20:07.538
I think that's the root
at the bottom, right?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.540
- Over here?
- I think so. Yeah.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.465
RICK:
It's pretty big, whatever it is.

20:17.624 --> 20:19.175
BILLY:
The color is like oak.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.798
- Did you do this, Gary?
- Yeah, I did it. Yeah.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.133
No metal hits in that.

20:29.219 --> 20:31.804
RICK: Well, it was
four to six feet down.

20:31.888 --> 20:34.640
I mean, that says
something about dry--

20:34.733 --> 20:35.983
It being dry land.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.559
- Yeah.
- And then, somehow,

20:37.644 --> 20:40.404
four feet of organics went over

20:40.563 --> 20:42.490
the top of it
and then it became a wetland.

Yeah.

RICK: At one time,

21:06.589 --> 21:08.841
- forestland, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:08.925 --> 21:11.102
A tree of this size
would not be rooted,

21:11.261 --> 21:12.270
unless it were dry.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.022

a certain date as to</i>

21:15.181 --> 21:17.766
<i>when the swamp became a swamp.</i>

21:17.859 --> 21:20.111

to tell a story.

Are there any houses

24:02.682 --> 24:03.682
There's no-- I don't think
there's ever been

24:03.775 --> 24:05.526
anything constructed on Lot 4.

24:05.685 --> 24:09.947
If you had an expedition
to sink a shaft,

24:10.106 --> 24:12.274
for whatever reason,
you would need timbers.

24:12.358 --> 24:15.369
- Yes.
- And you'd want them to fit together well.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.529
- Yes.
- So, you might need such a tool.

24:17.614 --> 24:19.698
You send your crew over there,
"I need...

24:19.782 --> 24:22.201
I need 400 six-by-sixes."

24:22.285 --> 24:23.878
Whatever.
"And they better fit."

24:24.037 --> 24:25.129
Then you'd need that, right?

24:25.213 --> 24:26.955
- You would use a tool like this.
- MARTY: Yeah.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.208
- For the cribbing?
- MARTY: Exactly.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.386
I'm actually glad that we're
looking closer at Lot 4.

24:32.545 --> 24:34.129
Man, that's a bit of a mystery.

24:34.214 --> 24:35.797

That's clearly pre-searcher.

24:47.894 --> 24:50.070
Okay. Well, that's interesting.

24:50.230 --> 24:51.572
It's very old, potentially,

24:51.656 --> 24:52.823
but it's kind of
a mystery, still.

24:52.908 --> 24:53.899
- Very old.
- So that's good.

24:53.992 --> 24:54.909
Bit of a mystery.

24:54.993 --> 24:55.817
You know, out of place

24:55.911 --> 24:57.912

What a shock.

24:58.071 --> 24:58.987
All right.
Well, thank you very much.

24:59.072 --> 24:59.914

<i>of the mysterious adze
that was found on Lot 4.</i>

25:24.773 --> 25:28.192
There it is: a beautiful adze.

25:28.351 --> 25:30.361
- Oh, goodness. - Really?
- ALEX: Mm-hmm.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.445
- RICK: We thought it might be.
- GARY: Yeah.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.197
ALEX:
Yeah, so he confirmed that.

25:33.356 --> 25:35.366
He knew exactly what that was.
He said this

25:35.450 --> 25:37.109
is an adze,
but he said English style.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.536
Excellent.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.870
ALEX:
Because of the square hole,

25:39.955 --> 25:42.623
which you can see,
and as well as

25:42.707 --> 25:44.208
the notch right there.

25:44.292 --> 25:48.796
Also potentially makes it
as old as 1620 to 1740.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.881
- Wow.
- Wow.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.125
- That is fantastic.
- MARTY: Yeah.

25:53.209 --> 25:55.803
The idea is that you could use

25:55.887 --> 25:58.556
an axe to make
a hand-hewn timber.

25:58.715 --> 26:01.225
But if that timber needed
to be smooth,

26:01.384 --> 26:03.218
more like this tabletop,
you'd work this thing.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.229
This would have been very sharp.

26:05.388 --> 26:07.055
It's where you need
a fine finish.

26:07.140 --> 26:09.567
- ALEX: Right.
- Finer than just axe-cut.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.735
JACK: So what's it doing
over on Lot 4?

26:11.820 --> 26:14.396
Unless, possibly,
it has to do with the hatch?

26:14.489 --> 26:15.906
Yeah, that's what
I was going to say.

26:16.065 --> 26:17.491
The only thing I can think
on Lot 4 that

26:17.576 --> 26:20.494
we have any information for
is the hatch from Zena's map.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.831
I mean, Zena's map goes
back to 13, 1400s,

26:23.915 --> 26:25.749
but still,
we're having a lot of finds

26:25.908 --> 26:28.827
on Lot 4, so on the western
side of the island.

26:28.911 --> 26:30.421
What were they doing over here?

26:30.580 --> 26:32.748
Yeah, and I bloody love
that date range.

26:32.832 --> 26:35.342
That is well before
the story of the Money Pit.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.670
<i>RICK: The date
is very interesting:</i>

26:38.763 --> 26:41.089
1620 to 1740.

26:41.174 --> 26:44.268
It seems that we keep
pushing the dates,

26:44.352 --> 26:47.512
uh, of the finds
further and further back.

26:47.597 --> 26:50.524
<i>I find that quite compelling.</i>

26:50.609 --> 26:53.027
If you're making significant
finds on the lot line between

26:53.111 --> 26:56.363
4 and 5, then we should
continue to clear out Lot 4.

26:56.522 --> 27:00.117
<i>I think that the work done
on Oak Island was incremental.</i>

27:00.201 --> 27:02.277
<i>In other words,
there seems to be</i>

27:02.362 --> 27:05.614
a master plan
and it was implemented

27:05.698 --> 27:08.208
over a period of years,
if not decades.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.119
MARTY: Okay.
Well, that's our story.

27:11.204 --> 27:15.215
Uh, could be very significant
'cause it's quite old.

27:15.300 --> 27:19.044
It could be even older after
you find out about this, Rick.

27:19.128 --> 27:21.380
And then, then we're just left
with the problem of, well,

27:21.473 --> 27:24.475
- how long was it used before it was discarded?
- Yeah.

27:24.634 --> 27:26.477
RICK:
As far as Lot 4 is concerned,

27:26.561 --> 27:28.062
these are not just
one-off things.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.723
Everything we talk about here
in the war room should lead us

27:31.808 --> 27:33.809
to advancing the search agenda
and that's...

27:33.893 --> 27:35.319
And I think we've done that.

27:35.478 --> 27:36.737
This proves there's
more things to find,

27:36.896 --> 27:38.230
but we won't find them in here.

so big anymore, does it?

28:21.858 --> 28:22.700
No.

It looks like a chop mark
from something like an adze.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.855
<i>RICK:
I think it's very early.</i>

29:43.940 --> 29:46.274
<i>I think there's a lot
more work to be done.</i>

29:46.359 --> 29:49.444
But, in the moment,
it's surprising.

29:49.529 --> 29:52.197
It's, it's, uh...
exciting.

29:52.281 --> 29:54.708
Um...

29:54.793 --> 29:56.418
I-It's remarkable.

29:57.870 --> 29:59.463
Kind of looks hewn, doesn't it?

29:59.547 --> 30:01.632
I don't know.
And then you have that.

30:01.716 --> 30:02.958
LAIRD:
See this, here?

30:03.042 --> 30:05.469
It's kind of a possible cut.

30:05.628 --> 30:07.971
That, I think is--
Could be of interest.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.381
We're not too far away
from where

30:09.465 --> 30:10.891
we found that piece of wood.

30:11.050 --> 30:13.060
I mean, that dated back to 700.

30:13.144 --> 30:16.396
- RICK: Let me throw some water on this.
- LAIRD: Okay.

30:16.556 --> 30:18.890
<i>RICK: I think everything
that we pull from the swamp</i>

30:18.975 --> 30:20.567
needs to be looked at carefully.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.310
The most innocuous piece of wood

30:22.395 --> 30:25.113
<i>might have some
very relevant information.</i>

30:27.400 --> 30:29.568
Whatcha got, big brother?

30:29.652 --> 30:32.404
I don't know if it's anything.

30:32.488 --> 30:33.330
Right there.

30:34.740 --> 30:36.625
- Okay.
- Right there.

30:37.994 --> 30:39.411
MARTY: Pretty rotten.
Look at this, though.

30:39.495 --> 30:41.997
- Right here.
- Yeah, I don't know.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.249
<i>MARTY:
It passes the first test.</i>

30:44.333 --> 30:45.509
<i>It's shaped wood.</i>

30:45.593 --> 30:48.762
<i>So, if somebody analyzes it,
some expert...</i>

30:48.847 --> 30:51.673
<i>if something comes through
that it's very ancient,</i>

30:51.757 --> 30:53.675
then they become significant.
But...

30:53.759 --> 30:56.353
But they are already
somewhat significant

30:56.437 --> 30:58.856
because we're only digging
in a small area of the swamp.

30:59.015 --> 31:02.442
And why, really, at depth
are shaped pieces

31:02.527 --> 31:04.194
of wood in there at all?

31:07.532 --> 31:10.200
Is that another piece?

31:12.704 --> 31:15.864
Yeah, I'm gonna put a board
and go fish that out.

31:15.948 --> 31:17.782
- Hang on, Billy.
- LAIRD: I'll do it.

31:17.876 --> 31:18.700
GARY:
All right, mate.

31:18.793 --> 31:21.128

Not now.

31:21.287 --> 31:22.713
All right, mate.
Thanks.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.718

- All right, mate.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.050
He's going in.

31:35.134 --> 31:36.560
GARY:

31:36.719 --> 31:38.896
It is. Look!

31:41.900 --> 31:43.859
This is the same log!

31:50.658 --> 31:52.150
It's another flat piece...

31:52.243 --> 31:54.494
- Yeah.
- and it's got that same notch in.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.580
<i>NARRATOR: Near the southernmost
region of the swamp...</i>

31:56.664 --> 31:58.916

- Got it.

31:59.075 --> 32:01.159
<i>the Oak Island team

32:01.243 --> 32:03.921
<i>another potentially important

Look at that. And then
it goes down at a slope.

32:07.833 --> 32:08.833
Oh, that looks like a cut.

32:08.918 --> 32:10.344
- It does, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.929
GARY: That's the piece I saw.

32:14.515 --> 32:15.840
- LAIRD: Yeah.
- MARTY: What do you got?

32:15.925 --> 32:17.851
Interesting piece of wood, mate.

32:18.010 --> 32:19.519
Just like this other piece

32:19.604 --> 32:20.762
of wood that we found,

32:20.846 --> 32:22.856
it's got like two indents here.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.016
Well, I have a man
down on the beach,

32:25.109 --> 32:26.935
- so I'll get it washed.
- Okay, mate. - All right.

32:27.019 --> 32:29.521
Very similar to that other one.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.783
<i>MARTY: Billy and Gary find
a few pieces of wood.</i>

32:32.942 --> 32:34.785
They clearly appear
to be man-made.

32:34.944 --> 32:37.195
Here you go,
have a go at that one.

32:37.279 --> 32:38.697
It's heavy.

32:38.781 --> 32:40.791
I can't tell what they are,
they just look like planks,

32:40.875 --> 32:44.461
<i>but maybe when
we clean them up, maybe they'll</i>

32:44.545 --> 32:47.297
<i>reveal what they might
have been used for.</i>

32:47.382 --> 32:50.884
Is that one
a little more interesting?

32:50.969 --> 32:53.303
A little bit more suspicious.

32:57.216 --> 32:58.967
All I'm thinking is,

32:59.060 --> 33:01.302
is it a candidate
for C-14 or not?

33:01.387 --> 33:03.313
MARTY: Right. In other words,
is it man-made?

33:03.472 --> 33:05.148
- RICK: I think this is...
- It's angled.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.143
RICK:
Yeah, it's like, chopped, right?

33:08.227 --> 33:10.070
- Yeah, to what end, though?
- I don't know. (scoffs)

33:10.154 --> 33:14.816
Yeah, that swamp
is really, really weird.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.743
Would you expect something else?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.663
- What's the definition of madness?
- (both chuckle)

33:19.822 --> 33:22.332
- We're not there yet.
- We're close.

33:22.491 --> 33:26.503
<i>RICK: Every time we dig anywhere
on Oak Island, we find something.</i>

33:26.587 --> 33:29.506
Uh, and that is certainly true
in the swamp proper.

33:31.751 --> 33:33.835
- These are the finds?
- MARTY: Yeah.

33:33.919 --> 33:37.347
<i>RICK: Retrieve everything,
look at it carefully,</i>

33:37.432 --> 33:40.684
<i>document it, and then try
to reconstruct something.</i>

33:40.843 --> 33:42.594
There might be two pieces
of wood retrieved

33:42.687 --> 33:45.772
at different times that have
some sort of connection.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.983
It does feel like
there's a cut there.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.197
Thick and worn.

33:54.356 --> 33:56.274
Rounded.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.610
RICK: And we're close
by where Terry Deveau

33:58.694 --> 34:00.111
projected the wharf.

34:00.196 --> 34:01.121
Are we?

34:01.205 --> 34:02.781
Yeah.

34:02.865 --> 34:04.616
<i>NARRATOR:

34:04.700 --> 34:07.619

34:07.703 --> 34:11.956
<i>are actually connected to the
nearby stone wharf be correct?</i>

34:12.041 --> 34:14.885
BILLY: If it's an open harbor,
it's deeper on this side, right?

34:14.969 --> 34:16.461
And it gets shallower
up in the-- b-by the eye, right?

34:16.554 --> 34:18.963
Yeah, and the most interesting
stuff would be on the bottom,

34:19.048 --> 34:20.390
- right here, then.
- Yeah.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.392
- Which, you're not there yet.
- No.

34:22.551 --> 34:24.144
MARTY: If something
is hiding out there,

34:24.303 --> 34:26.063
it's got a lot of places
to hide.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.814
BILLY:
Lots of places.

34:27.899 --> 34:28.982
GARY:
All right, Billy, how about

34:29.141 --> 34:30.391
some treasure tomorrow?

34:30.485 --> 34:32.152
I'm with you, Gary, on that.

34:32.236 --> 34:34.229
GARY:
God, I love this place.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.324
<i>NARRATOR:

34:37.408 --> 34:40.410
<i>MARTY: Dr. Brosseau,
welcome back to the war room.</i>

34:40.495 --> 34:41.995
Appreciate you
being willing to travel.

34:42.154 --> 34:43.905
It really helps us a lot.

34:43.989 --> 34:46.491
<i>NARRATOR: Rick, Marty

34:46.584 --> 34:49.244
<i>Professor of Chemistry
Dr. Christa Brosseau</i>

34:49.328 --> 34:52.330
<i>to meet with members of the team
in the war room</i>

34:52.414 --> 34:54.341
<i>to present her analysis
of several items</i>

34:54.425 --> 34:57.502
<i>discovered one week ago
on Lot 4.</i>

34:57.595 --> 35:01.681
<i>These items include
a mysterious metal object</i>

35:01.766 --> 35:03.183
<i>as well as a button</i>

35:03.342 --> 35:06.261
<i>which preliminary X-ray
fluorescence scanning revealed</i>

35:06.345 --> 35:09.606
<i>to contain
a significant amount of gold.</i>

35:09.765 --> 35:12.275
CHRISTA:
So, I'll start with the button.

35:12.434 --> 35:15.529
So, this is sort of
a classic tombac button.

35:15.688 --> 35:16.863
What does that word mean?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.198
Yeah, "tombac" is, uh,

35:18.282 --> 35:20.525
one of, sort of, a common term

35:20.609 --> 35:23.870
- given to a high zinc-copper alloy.
- Oh, okay.

35:24.029 --> 35:28.208
CHRISTA: This is the breakdown
of the main body of the button.

35:28.292 --> 35:32.453
It's, uh, copper-tin with
a fairly high zinc content.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.539
Arsenic and lead
are also present.

35:34.623 --> 35:37.125
Likely they were original
to the copper itself,

35:37.209 --> 35:40.545
predating the modern refinement
of copper alloys.

35:40.629 --> 35:45.216
The copper loop
has a very high bismuth content,

35:45.309 --> 35:49.563
which is indicative that the
copper originated in Britain.

35:49.722 --> 35:53.984
And so, this is most likely
a-a British-origin button.

35:54.143 --> 36:00.481
You will see the circles
around the-the eye.

36:00.566 --> 36:03.326
And that's a very characteristic
feature for buttons

36:03.485 --> 36:07.080
that were made
between 1726 and 1776.

36:07.239 --> 36:08.915
<i>NARRATOR:
A British button,</i>

36:09.000 --> 36:11.918
<i>potentially dating back
70 years prior</i>

36:12.003 --> 36:14.838
<i>to the discovery
of the Money Pit?</i>

36:14.997 --> 36:17.340
<i>Since the team
has found a number</i>

36:17.425 --> 36:20.251
<i>of British military artifacts
from the same period</i>

36:20.344 --> 36:23.597
<i>across the island
over the past several years,</i>

36:23.756 --> 36:26.674
<i>could that answer the question
of who may have buried something</i>

36:26.759 --> 36:29.436
<i>of great value on Oak Island?</i>

36:29.520 --> 36:33.431
<i>Or could it mean that
the British were here searching</i>

36:33.515 --> 36:37.194
<i>for something left much earlier
by someone else?</i>

36:37.353 --> 36:41.156
So, the next object
is the piece of metal.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.276
It is definitely a copper alloy.

36:45.361 --> 36:47.612
It has a pretty high
tin content,

36:47.696 --> 36:50.123
so it's kind of consistent
with what's called

36:50.208 --> 36:52.617
a tin bronze or a bell metal.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.211
Specialty metal.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.713
- Yeah.
- When was this alloy identified?

36:56.872 --> 36:58.623
In other words,
when did it come into use?

36:58.707 --> 37:00.550
I would say it's older, yeah.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.877
Because the copper
contains arsenic,

37:02.962 --> 37:06.881
and usually that's been removed
by more modern refining methods.

37:06.966 --> 37:09.392
Would the presence
of arsenic in both

37:09.477 --> 37:11.719
suggest that the bell metal
would come from the same suspect

37:11.812 --> 37:14.481
- as the button?
- No, I don't think so.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.641
RICK:
When you go back to the screen,

37:16.725 --> 37:18.643
you'll see, at the-the last
sentence there,

37:18.727 --> 37:21.479
it says, "Bell metal was used
to construct early cannons

37:21.563 --> 37:23.823
by the Spanish and Portuguese."

37:23.908 --> 37:25.075
Yeah.

37:31.323 --> 37:32.490
<i>NARRATOR:
In the Oak Island war room</i>

37:32.583 --> 37:34.409
<i>chemist Dr. Christa Brosseau
has just shared</i>

37:34.493 --> 37:38.421
<i>an incredible report
that the metal object found</i>

37:38.580 --> 37:40.924
<i>one week ago on Lot 4
by Gary Drayton</i>

37:41.008 --> 37:44.669
<i>may be of either Spanish
or Portuguese origin.</i>

37:44.762 --> 37:49.432
So, the tin gives the-the metal
strength and rigidity.

37:49.517 --> 37:54.771
So, it's been used historically
for bells, obviously,

37:54.930 --> 37:56.773
but also for the production
of cannons.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.768
MARTY: Would you find it likely
to find this

38:00.861 --> 38:04.030
on other places
in the Maritimes?

38:04.189 --> 38:05.949
That's a good question.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.702
Um, I'd have to do
some more digging into that,

38:08.861 --> 38:11.029
but, um, it's possible.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.365
- We can do some research on that.
- Yeah, for sure.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.533
What is Lot 4?

38:15.626 --> 38:17.210
- What's your interest there?
- Uh, it's...

38:17.295 --> 38:19.129
RICK:
There was this map,

38:19.288 --> 38:22.373
which we, in truth,
are still trying to vet.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.884
You know, as part
of Zena Halpern's research,

38:24.969 --> 38:27.637
there is a reference
to "the hatch."

38:27.796 --> 38:30.882
And, uh, so, we continue
to search for that.

38:30.966 --> 38:33.301
We were chasing, uh, the hatch,

38:33.385 --> 38:35.812
and we were using
the magnetometer hits from CSR,

38:35.971 --> 38:37.397
and that was the first piece
we pulled up

38:37.481 --> 38:39.482
in one of the anomalies.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.651
Actually, I'm-I'm very intrigued
by the possibility

38:41.810 --> 38:43.478
that piece of bell metal
might be associated

38:43.562 --> 38:46.230
- with Portuguese on the island.
- Mm-hmm.

38:46.315 --> 38:51.411
They were among the first
to use cannon on board ships.

38:51.570 --> 38:55.239
<i>NARRATOR: It is well-documented
that Portuguese explorers</i>

<i>between the 16th and 18th

<i>as well as the stone wharf
in the swamp</i>

39:51.713 --> 39:56.810
<i>all be corroborative evidence
that this theory is true?</i>

39:56.894 --> 39:58.895
And this is why Dr. Brousseau

39:59.054 --> 40:01.564
is such a, you know,
such a great resource.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.567
<i>This metal was used by
the Spanish and the Portuguese</i>

40:04.652 --> 40:06.060
<i>for quite some time.</i>

40:06.153 --> 40:09.397
<i>It's an interesting thing
to think that such a metal</i>

40:09.481 --> 40:13.067
used in bells and cannons
would be on Lot 4.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.995
- Another mystery.
- Another mystery.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.414
- RICK: Yeah.
- DOUG: Gary's work with the metal detector

40:17.498 --> 40:19.323
just seems to indicate

40:19.417 --> 40:22.585
there's-- was a lot of activity
in that general area.

40:22.744 --> 40:24.421
The finds say that
there was activity

40:24.580 --> 40:27.090
over a seemingly
long period of time.

40:27.174 --> 40:28.425
TOM:
Something...

40:28.509 --> 40:30.260
happened in that area.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.012
Something about this island
a-attracted a lot

40:33.172 --> 40:35.348
- of effort.
- Mm-hmm.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.675
We got to go down that road
and see where that might lead.

40:37.759 --> 40:39.936
Okay. Well, again,
thank you for coming down.

40:40.095 --> 40:42.013
I always enjoy
these-these sessions very much.

40:42.097 --> 40:43.690
My pleasure. Good luck.

40:43.849 --> 40:46.017
<i>RICK:
Thank you.</i>

40:46.101 --> 40:48.695
<i>NARRATOR:
After another successful week</i>

40:48.854 --> 40:53.032
<i>that resulted in new discoveries
made all across Oak Island,</i>

40:53.192 --> 40:56.536
<i>the Laginas and their team
may be closer than ever</i>

40:56.695 --> 40:59.030
<i>to finally revealing the secrets</i>

40:59.123 --> 41:02.033
<i>that have endured
for more than two centuries.</i>

41:02.126 --> 41:06.370
<i>But as they continue
to narrow down the possibilities</i>

41:06.455 --> 41:08.965
<i>of who may have been
behind this mystery,</i>

41:09.049 --> 41:13.461
<i>are they also zeroing in
on a vast cache of treasure?</i>

41:13.545 --> 41:17.223
<i>Or will they find
that the deeper they dig,</i>

41:17.382 --> 41:20.810
<i>the darker the secrets become?</i>

41:24.473 --> 41:27.150
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:27.309 --> 41:28.893
Oh.

41:28.977 --> 41:30.728
Could be more pieces of a ship.

41:30.812 --> 41:32.563
MARTY: Holy smokes. What
do you think of that, Rick?

41:32.648 --> 41:34.324
The swamp is yielding things.

41:34.483 --> 41:36.409
- (beeping)
- Wow, it sounds fantastic.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.652
What the bloody hell is this?

41:37.736 --> 41:39.487
CARMEN:
It's a typical strap

41:39.571 --> 41:40.655
- for a heavy chest.
- Really?

41:40.748 --> 41:42.490
- That's a nice surprise.
- (laughs)

41:42.574 --> 41:44.000
RICK:
I have always thought the way

41:44.159 --> 41:46.753
to figure out the Money Pit
was finding Shaft 6.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.746
TERRY:
Okay! Look at that.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.915
If it's Shaft 6, how far
are we from the Money Pit?

41:50.999 --> 41:52.675
18 feet.

41:52.834 --> 41:54.511
