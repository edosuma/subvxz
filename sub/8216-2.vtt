WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:04.319
I'm Jamie Hyneman, and
you're watching "Mythbusters."

00:06.344 --> 00:07.491
coming up...

00:07.559 --> 00:10.056
Can you get stuck
to an airline toilet?

00:10.124 --> 00:12.149
Exposed butt cheeks.

00:12.217 --> 00:14.106
There we go.

00:14.242 --> 00:16.402
building a biscuit bazooka.

00:16.604 --> 00:18.629
ho-ho, no!

00:19.372 --> 00:22.950
wow! that just went everywhere.

00:22.950 --> 00:26.662
The leaping lawyer...
fact or fantasy?

00:28.755 --> 00:31.254
You want more?

00:36.519 --> 00:38.408
here on "Mythbusters"

00:38.544 --> 00:40.570
we're not just going
to retell the legends.

00:40.704 --> 00:42.999
we're gonna put 'em to the test.

00:43.202 --> 00:45.835
we're prepared
to put our bodies on the line.

00:45.970 --> 00:49.615
why should you trust these guys?

00:49.750 --> 00:51.303
well, Jamie and Adam

00:51.370 --> 00:54.002
have over 30 years
in model building,

00:54.205 --> 00:57.108
animatronics,
and toy prototyping.

00:57.311 --> 00:59.335
they can build
just about anything

00:59.403 --> 01:01.361
and probably have.

01:01.496 --> 01:04.263
This is M5,
my special-effects shop.

01:05.749 --> 01:07.842
come on in
and have a look around.

01:07.976 --> 01:11.353
if we can't find
what we need here

01:11.487 --> 01:14.457
there's always
Adam's junk collection.

01:14.659 --> 01:17.630
my cigarette dispenser.

01:17.833 --> 01:18.575
ow!

01:18.777 --> 01:21.613
and they'll need
every trick in the book.

01:21.613 --> 01:24.922
So, where do we begin?
What do we got?

01:29.954 --> 01:33.194
This story involves a large
woman, an obese woman.

01:33.329 --> 01:36.705
flying on an S.A.S. flight
um.. from Europe

01:36.839 --> 01:39.337
and as she was going along,
she had to use the restroom.

01:39.539 --> 01:42.307
she flushed it while she was
still sitting on the toilet.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.670
and it suctioned her down
a little bit.

01:44.873 --> 01:46.763
and she was stuck.

01:46.965 --> 01:48.990
and they had to land the plane
with her on the toilet.

01:49.058 --> 01:51.016
where the air-flight crews

01:51.084 --> 01:53.716
had to come
and assist her to get off.

01:55.876 --> 01:58.037
what exactly
are we gonna need to test this?

02:01.480 --> 02:05.935
we have to create
a large female posterior..

02:06.070 --> 02:07.690
posterior... is that how we...

02:07.758 --> 02:09.646
posterior, yes.

02:13.428 --> 02:15.926
did you go to art school, Jamie?

02:15.994 --> 02:17.141
[chuckles]

02:17.208 --> 02:20.246
I build real stuff.
I don't know how to draw it.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.339
I get the I..
you know what's what here, huh?

02:22.406 --> 02:25.376
I do. it could also be
like a big leg of lamb

02:25.512 --> 02:27.739
cooking over a barbecue, though,
with a gas feed.

02:27.874 --> 02:28.886
that sounds kind of good.

02:29.089 --> 02:31.722
we got to rig
a means of measuring

02:31.858 --> 02:33.612
how much pull-down there is.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.706
to me,
that means a big fish scale.

02:35.773 --> 02:37.392
- mm-hmm.
- we'll use a forklift.

02:37.595 --> 02:39.283
we'll hoist this big ass
over the toilet.

02:39.350 --> 02:41.916
hanging off the fish scale.

02:42.051 --> 02:44.413
we lower it on there,
and then we turn the pump on.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.047
and then we raise the forklift

02:47.181 --> 02:49.948
and see how much suck
the thing has

02:50.151 --> 02:54.134
before it lets go,
via the fish scale

02:54.134 --> 02:55.619
and we're gonna have to
custom...

02:55.822 --> 02:56.970
we're gonna have to invent one

02:57.037 --> 02:59.535
because that's
a pretty big fish.

02:59.669 --> 03:00.885
this woman was, like...

03:01.021 --> 03:03.653
I guess
could have been a 300-rounder.

03:03.788 --> 03:05.812
in the aircraft market,

03:05.881 --> 03:09.323
we have approximately
13,000 vacuum toilets

03:09.323 --> 03:11.957
in operation on a daily basis.

03:13.509 --> 03:17.491
the toilet story
broken in early 2001.

03:17.559 --> 03:20.121
we were quite surprised
how much press it did get.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074

03:29.507 --> 03:33.793
We're at Interface Aviation
in Hollister, California

03:35.718 --> 03:37.743
oh, my god!

03:38.014 --> 03:42.401
Interface Aviation is
a aircraft recycling company

03:42.729 --> 03:44.367
that acquires aircraft parts

03:44.901 --> 03:47.152
and they end up here.

03:46.654 --> 03:49.084
I like this. this must be
the stairway from a...

03:50.367 --> 03:51.651
yeah.

03:51.717 --> 03:55.835
they've got 3 1/2 acres
of used aircraft interiors.

03:55.903 --> 03:59.413
all the panelling, the bathrooms,
all the food preparation

03:59.548 --> 04:01.574
good lord!

04:01.641 --> 04:03.666
- and the toilets.
- and the toilets

04:03.733 --> 04:06.366
they've got every kind of toilet
that's ever been made

04:06.569 --> 04:08.392
for any kind of aircraft,
or so it would seem.

04:08.594 --> 04:11.632
do you remember what airline
you heard it happened on?

04:11.700 --> 04:14.079
no. no.

04:14.283 --> 04:16.731
you guys...

04:16.866 --> 04:20.536
um, I know my toilets,
but I don't know my legends.

04:20.741 --> 04:21.353
okay.

04:21.557 --> 04:22.918
fair enough.

04:23.122 --> 04:26.793
interface carries
two completely different

04:26.929 --> 04:28.833
human waste disposal units.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.600
- here's the old style.
- look at that.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.211
all right.

04:31.415 --> 04:32.979
that's filled up
with blue water.

04:33.116 --> 04:34.611
you can use
your own imagination

04:34.815 --> 04:36.718
what that water's made of
after a while.

04:41.206 --> 04:43.993
the average pressure here
is exactly zero.

04:44.130 --> 04:45.013
right.

04:45.150 --> 04:48.141
because you're just recycling
out of the common tank.

04:48.277 --> 04:50.249
the pressure should be zero,

04:50.453 --> 04:54.395
but if something...
say, a hairbrush...

04:54.395 --> 04:56.707
gets caught in the outlet valves

04:56.775 --> 04:58.679
while the aircraft
is at altitude...

04:58.747 --> 05:00.651
now we're talking.

05:00.855 --> 05:02.011
okay, do you see
where I'm going here?

05:02.215 --> 05:03.031
- yeah.
- mm-hmm. mm-hmm.

05:03.234 --> 05:06.089
she could generate
a differential in pressure

05:06.158 --> 05:08.334
the greater pressure
inside would actually

05:08.538 --> 05:10.508
be trying to push her
through the hole.

05:10.712 --> 05:12.685
has one problem...

05:12.753 --> 05:15.200
that theory of toilet terror
has one problem...

05:15.268 --> 05:18.328
it could only happen
at altitude.

05:18.396 --> 05:22.339
according to the legend
and the information we have,

05:22.543 --> 05:24.447
they said that the woman

05:24.582 --> 05:27.029
actually stayed on the toilet
until they were on the ground.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.410
well, that would rule out the
pressure differential theory,

05:29.546 --> 05:31.381
- wouldn't it?
- exactly, exactly

05:31.449 --> 05:33.421
that leaves this vacuum unit.

05:33.490 --> 05:37.569
it has pressure at altitude
and on the ground.

05:37.636 --> 05:39.812
the vacuum toilet operates
at two different pressures.

05:40.016 --> 05:41.511
on the ground, it operates

05:41.579 --> 05:44.435
at approximately
three PSI negative pressure.

05:44.503 --> 05:47.290
and at altitude,
we operate at eight psi

05:47.358 --> 05:49.262
negative pressure.

05:49.466 --> 05:51.505
that pressure is produced
b y the differential

05:51.709 --> 05:54.022
between the inside cabin air

05:54.226 --> 05:55.721
and the outside of the aircraft.

05:55.789 --> 06:00.344
this is the one, but at 9 grand,
it doesn't come cheap

06:04.084 --> 06:05.987
one of the biggest problems
that I see

06:06.123 --> 06:10.678
is that we've got to mimic
a woman's butt really well.

06:10.815 --> 06:12.174
it has to be nice
and fleshy and soft,

06:12.378 --> 06:14.554
so we've got to decide
on what kind of...

06:14.758 --> 06:16.797
it's gonna be
a rubber of some sort.

06:16.865 --> 06:18.429
I thought of using this rubber

06:18.497 --> 06:20.333
That's used
in a lot of sex toys,

06:20.468 --> 06:22.236
because it's very fleshy...
it's called hot-melt vinyl.

06:30.939 --> 06:33.659
I'd like to see a sample
of the hot-melt vinyl you have.

06:33.795 --> 06:35.698
is this hod melt?

06:35.766 --> 06:37.805
yeah, that's the one
that's really sticky.

06:37.942 --> 06:40.865
that's the one that i like.
this is the one that i want.

06:40.933 --> 06:44.877
we are casting up
a really large bottom,

06:44.877 --> 06:46.032
and we're going to stick it

06:46.236 --> 06:48.003
to an airline toilet seat
that we have,

06:48.072 --> 06:51.063
so this is actually perfect.
this is definitely the stuff.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.919
[smack] yeah.
that sounds right.

06:53.987 --> 06:56.503
i might want to buy
as much as 10 gallons.

06:56.638 --> 06:59.290
so that comes in flesh or clear.

06:59.359 --> 07:01.194
flesh, of course.

07:01.398 --> 07:03.505
you'd like to try
the butt head?

07:05.749 --> 07:07.448
there you are, sir.

07:07.652 --> 07:10.169
do i have to pull out the, uh...

07:14.656 --> 07:17.919
and now the transformation
is complete.

07:17.986 --> 07:20.350
i come from
the planet butt head.

07:26.586 --> 07:28.556
so, how did you have this done?

07:28.621 --> 07:30.590
That's actually Kari's butt.

07:30.656 --> 07:32.888
No. Really?

07:32.953 --> 07:36.564
except that we let her
modify herself.

07:36.761 --> 07:38.008
okay, I'm gonna take a shot.

07:38.139 --> 07:39.978
Try to hold as still
as possible from now on.

07:40.175 --> 07:41.947
we scanned her butt.

07:42.144 --> 07:44.245
and that's probably
the best shot

07:44.442 --> 07:47.001
that you'll ever see
of your own butt.

07:47.132 --> 07:50.219
[laughs]

07:50.350 --> 07:52.056
oh, yeah, right.

07:52.122 --> 07:55.142
and then we took it

07:55.142 --> 07:58.029
and used the free-form tool
to enlarge it

07:58.160 --> 08:01.378
and put a lot of cottage-cheese
thighs in there,

08:01.378 --> 08:02.559
the whole thing.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.332
it really looks great.

08:04.529 --> 08:05.841
it's a really, really nice...

08:06.038 --> 08:08.270
it really looks great?
you like that?

08:08.401 --> 08:10.043
I'm looking forward
to spanking it.

08:10.174 --> 08:12.865
a 300-pound butt

08:12.996 --> 08:15.491
some significant reinforcing.

08:15.688 --> 08:19.102
there's a science
to making butts.

08:19.168 --> 08:22.121
think of all the twinkies

08:22.186 --> 08:23.893
that go into the actual

08:26.519 --> 08:27.467
what most people spend
a lifetime avoiding.

08:33.450 --> 08:35.302
this is what I had in mind.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.551
if we have our forklift here,

08:37.683 --> 08:39.799
and we hook a line onto it.

08:39.998 --> 08:41.850
we go down to a pivot point,

08:41.982 --> 08:46.084
and we have a bar
that is on the pivot point.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.201
[clattering]

08:52.764 --> 08:55.939
and the bar is longer
on this side than the other

08:56.137 --> 08:57.659
we put barbell weights
over here.

08:57.791 --> 08:59.908
we have
another pivot point here

08:59.974 --> 09:03.678
that goes down to the butt.

09:03.877 --> 09:07.448
and there is our strain gauge.

09:07.448 --> 09:11.417
we've made an agreement
not to damage this toilet,

09:11.549 --> 09:14.262
so we want to mount it
in a way that it doesn't...

09:14.328 --> 09:16.907
yeah, it's got mount points...
good, strong ones.

09:17.105 --> 09:19.884
we might want to also... I don 't
know... come up on the sides,

09:20.017 --> 09:21.736
or somehow do
some other stuff to it

09:21.803 --> 09:23.654
to make sure
that it doesn't strain hurt

09:23.853 --> 09:25.440
I mean, this is
definitely welded stainless

09:25.639 --> 09:27.558
that's why these things cost
so much,

09:27.755 --> 09:29.740
is that it's all done
to high specifications

09:29.805 --> 09:31.261
I mean, look at the welds
on these things.

09:31.328 --> 09:32.650
it's a perfect little...

09:32.782 --> 09:34.436
oh, my god, that's beautiful.

09:34.503 --> 09:36.421
when we've finished admiring it,

09:36.553 --> 09:39.794
we better get on with finding
something to make it suck.

09:39.926 --> 09:42.440
I've got one of those things

09:42.571 --> 09:46.607
that I believe pushes pneumatics
around in the stores

09:46.805 --> 09:50.377
when you want to get change
in a big department store...

09:50.443 --> 09:55.007
oh, you got one op those?
the vacuum... oh, that's cool.

09:55.140 --> 09:58.579
our pump generates
just three psi...

09:58.777 --> 10:04.069
that's three pounds per square
inch of exposed butt.

10:04.069 --> 10:06.119
what is this?

10:06.186 --> 10:09.691
this is about 13 inches
by 15 inches,

10:09.824 --> 10:14.124
so... 150 times...

10:14.190 --> 10:16.174
what did we say? three psi.

10:16.239 --> 10:18.952
three psi. 450.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.466
- that's 450 pounds.
- pounds of pull.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.318
so if we had
a perfect seal on this

10:23.450 --> 10:25.104
with a rubber gasket

10:25.303 --> 10:27.022
it would take 450 pounds
to remove it

10:27.088 --> 10:28.146
just from a three psi.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.462
and you could see how a woman
wouldn't be able to get off...

10:30.594 --> 10:32.380
absolutely, yeah.

10:32.512 --> 10:35.025
she'd have one big Hickey

10:35.157 --> 10:36.348
big butt Hickey

10:36.547 --> 10:38.201
that's gonna be hard to explain.

10:38.266 --> 10:42.499
things are
coming together at last.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.402
that's ugly

10:46.535 --> 10:49.445
I think it actually
came out pretty nice.

10:49.644 --> 10:51.099
yeah, I'm not displeased.

10:54.869 --> 10:59.498
before the experiment can begin,
we have to balance the butt.

10:59.565 --> 11:02.344
Jamie's using
a four-to-one ratio...

11:02.476 --> 11:04.526
300 pounds of butt

11:04.724 --> 11:07.436
balanced against 75
on the pivot arm.

11:07.635 --> 11:10.744
okay, guys, we got some
serious weight going on here,

11:10.876 --> 11:13.588
so never stand
under anything at all.

11:13.786 --> 11:15.639
keep your eye
on what's going on.

11:15.771 --> 11:18.218
we don't know how much weight
it's gonna take before it rips.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.731
so we're gonna turn on the pump.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.452
we're gonna lower
the butt into place.

11:22.584 --> 11:24.370
we'll see if we get
any pressure on this.

11:24.502 --> 11:26.883
- uh-huh.
- we'll let it take weight,

11:27.015 --> 11:29.462
and then we'll slowly
start to raise

11:29.529 --> 11:31.778
and see how much poundage
it takes

11:31.977 --> 11:34.225
to remove Bertha
from the toilet.

11:34.358 --> 11:36.407
sounds like a plan.

11:36.474 --> 11:38.590
contact.

11:44.345 --> 11:46.727
if the butt creates a seal,

11:46.793 --> 11:49.307
we should see a jump
in vacuum pressure.

11:58.964 --> 12:01.477
okay, should I bring it up?

12:01.609 --> 12:03.594
around three psi.

12:03.660 --> 12:05.181
we're still measuring
around three psi.

12:05.314 --> 12:08.621
the toilet seat is preventing us
from making a seal

12:13.648 --> 12:15.632
I think it's much more plausible

12:15.831 --> 12:19.007
that she sat down
without putting that seat down.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.247
okay, that's easy to test.

12:31.441 --> 12:32.499
that's better.

12:32.698 --> 12:36.468
that's a seal, but it's
not taking that much pressure.

12:36.600 --> 12:41.891
we'll, uh, pull the plug
and see if we can rethink this.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.705
well, we're getting
a significant amount of suction

12:48.705 --> 12:50.623
out of the toilet,

12:50.822 --> 12:55.452
and the needle was bouncing more
without the toilet seat on.

12:55.584 --> 12:57.965
and checking all the way around,
we had a reasonable seal.

12:58.032 --> 13:00.743
but that air gap
between the shroud and the bowl

13:00.876 --> 13:03.720
just prevented
any real suction from occurring.

13:03.787 --> 13:07.358
this myth's starting
to look decidedly shaky.

13:07.425 --> 13:10.069
these two lugs under the shroud

13:10.136 --> 13:12.915
have been preventing
an air lock from forming.

13:12.981 --> 13:14.435
I believe, myself,

13:14.502 --> 13:17.809
that the toilets are designed
to not seal

13:17.875 --> 13:18.736
right.

13:18.868 --> 13:22.175
Adam can sniff a conspiracy.

13:22.241 --> 13:24.887
do you think they put
that in after the myth,

13:25.019 --> 13:26.738
- like, as a response?
- no, no.

13:26.937 --> 13:29.253
personally, I think
we might want to try it

13:29.318 --> 13:30.310
without the shroud

13:30.443 --> 13:32.096
just to see if there's
actually enough suction

13:32.162 --> 13:33.619
if there was a seal.

13:33.751 --> 13:35.734
okay, contact.

13:37.322 --> 13:39.636
down we come.

13:39.835 --> 13:41.621
all right, bring it on down.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.738
however unlikely,
we want to cover the possibility

13:43.804 --> 13:45.259
we want to cover the possibility

13:45.326 --> 13:47.310
that the victim's butt
was so large

13:47.376 --> 13:51.543
it reached down
and made contact with the bowl.

13:51.609 --> 13:53.924
[laughing]

13:57.298 --> 13:59.614
that's as good a seal as we get.

13:59.679 --> 14:01.532
okay, Kari, lower the weight.

14:01.730 --> 14:03.384
time to measure the suction.

14:03.516 --> 14:04.508
all right, here we go.

14:04.574 --> 14:07.947
go! keep going, all the way up.

14:11.982 --> 14:15.290
there was a... this whole
butt cheek right here...

14:15.422 --> 14:17.473
this whole butt cheek
was distended

14:17.605 --> 14:19.655
about another three inches down.

14:19.721 --> 14:21.904
the whole butt was deformed.

14:22.037 --> 14:23.955
she's got a hell of a Hickey

14:24.087 --> 14:27.460
we got a really good seal on
the butt crack in that last one.

14:27.527 --> 14:29.511
there was a little bit of...

14:29.643 --> 14:32.024
it didn't want to give
at first when you lifted,

14:32.157 --> 14:35.001
but it didn't take very much
I mean...

14:35.199 --> 14:36.655
yeah, I saw what the...

14:38.838 --> 14:43.666
the toilet was generating
400 pounds of suction,

14:43.732 --> 14:45.651
but the scale shows
it would take

14:45.716 --> 14:47.700
a fraction of that
to break the seal.

14:48.164 --> 14:49.619
I'd say a woman this large...

14:49.751 --> 14:51.934
I man,
she'd be able to pull a cheek

14:52.001 --> 14:54.051
or move herself around
a little bit

14:54.116 --> 14:55.440
and release the gap.

14:55.506 --> 14:57.756
I mean, we're talking... if
someone really couldn't do that,

14:57.821 --> 14:59.805
we're talking someone
maybe even twice this large.

14:59.938 --> 15:01.922
and then I'm not even sure they
could fit in an airplane toilet.

15:02.054 --> 15:04.105
yeah, I would agree.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.288
what's more,

15:06.354 --> 15:08.471
a properly functioning toilet

15:08.536 --> 15:11.447
creates suction
for just two seconds.

15:11.646 --> 15:14.159
if something were to go
inside the bowl

15:14.226 --> 15:16.276
and get stuck inside of there,
the pressure is probably

15:16.474 --> 15:18.458
about twice as much
as a normal shop VAC

15:18.524 --> 15:18.988
as a normal shop VAC

15:19.186 --> 15:20.509
at your home.

15:20.707 --> 15:23.155
as you can see, there's
no damage to a person's hand

15:23.287 --> 15:25.140
if they do put it
inside the bowl.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.761
and really
all you do is get wet.

15:30.828 --> 15:32.812
myth busted,

15:33.605 --> 15:37.706
and we're prepared to stake,
uh, Adam's butt on it.

15:37.839 --> 15:41.079
are you ready to try it,
you know, the real deal?

15:41.213 --> 15:42.800
- sure.
- alright.

15:48.223 --> 15:51.200
now, what if you, like...
if you're hurt?

15:51.267 --> 15:54.508
like, what if this
starts to feel uncomfortable...

15:54.573 --> 15:56.492
I'll take it gradually.

15:56.558 --> 15:58.741
if I feel things moving around
that shouldn't be moving,

15:58.874 --> 16:01.189
I'll disconnect.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.966
'cause I can't hear you
when I turn this on...

16:04.165 --> 16:05.487
you'll hear
high-pitched squealing.

16:05.686 --> 16:06.812
[laughs]

16:10.779 --> 16:12.962
all right, contact.

16:13.094 --> 16:14.880
all right.

16:14.947 --> 16:17.857
expose butt cheeks. here we go.

16:17.924 --> 16:20.568
[machinery whirs]

16:20.635 --> 16:24.075
whoa!

16:24.075 --> 16:27.117
[farting sounds]

16:29.696 --> 16:32.939
whoa! [laughs]

16:33.004 --> 16:36.113
all right!

16:38.296 --> 16:39.487
all right, that's significant.

16:39.685 --> 16:42.067
I.. [laughs]

16:44.778 --> 16:46.961
oh, my gosh.

16:49.739 --> 16:52.451
oh, wow,
that was really significant.

16:52.650 --> 16:55.626
that was... that was...

16:57.345 --> 16:59.263
all right.

17:01.314 --> 17:02.638
that was impressively

17:02.835 --> 17:05.415
significant amount
of [bleep] suction.

17:08.392 --> 17:12.228
the whole thing
was vibrating with the pressure.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.213
we got up to five psi.

17:14.411 --> 17:16.329
yeah, it was...
that was significant.

17:16.395 --> 17:18.777
um...

17:18.844 --> 17:20.165
I mean, I had my... [laughs]

17:20.364 --> 17:22.150
I'm trying
to talk scientifically.

17:22.217 --> 17:25.258
I was able to use my arms,
but if I didn't have arms,

17:25.391 --> 17:28.699
I would not probably
have been able to free myself.

17:28.898 --> 17:30.815
I'm not sure
what was proved here,

17:31.013 --> 17:33.461
but at least
it's good television.

17:33.593 --> 17:35.844
another one bites the dust.
good work.

17:44.579 --> 17:46.548
this next legend involves...

17:46.751 --> 17:49.334
it's called the biscuit bullet,
and it's actually pretty funny.

17:49.537 --> 17:52.322
the way I heard it... the sister
of a friend of a friend

17:52.389 --> 17:53.816
went to the supermarket

17:53.951 --> 17:55.853
and it was on a very hot day,

17:56.058 --> 17:58.095
and she hears
this loud explosion behind her.

17:58.162 --> 18:00.200
and when she heard the pop
and felt this sticky mass

18:00.268 --> 18:01.762
and felt this sticky mass

18:01.898 --> 18:04.140
in the back of her head...
she thought she'd been shot.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.585
and so she better
just kind of hold still

18:06.788 --> 18:09.165
and try and hold her brains
from falling out of her head,

18:09.369 --> 18:11.475
until the paramedics get there.

18:11.543 --> 18:13.581
and when the paramedics pry
the woman's fingers

18:13.648 --> 18:16.501
off the back of her head,
they find that she's hanging

18:16.569 --> 18:18.742
of raw biscuit dough.

18:20.916 --> 18:23.836
so, what do you think we're
gonna need for this experiment?

18:23.973 --> 18:26.077
well, we're gonna need
some biscuit dough

18:26.281 --> 18:27.572
of a bunch of different...

18:27.640 --> 18:29.882
a bunch of these canisters
of different sizes

18:30.085 --> 18:31.443
or different types and brands.

18:31.647 --> 18:34.703
so we've got to get a car.

18:34.703 --> 18:36.401
we can use my oar to do this.

18:36.605 --> 18:38.371
I would think
that we'd want to duplicate

18:38.439 --> 18:40.477
the car's interior temperature

18:40.544 --> 18:42.582
by, say, pointing heaters
into the windows.

18:42.785 --> 18:46.657
can we build a fire
under your car? do you mind?

18:46.657 --> 18:48.490
yeah, absolutely.
that's no problem at all.

18:48.694 --> 18:52.770
we would want to get the
temperature stable in the car,

18:52.906 --> 18:54.944
and then move
the biscuits right in

18:55.215 --> 18:58.135
and start the timer and see how
long it takes them to go off.

18:59.766 --> 19:04.860
step one in our recipe...
getting the dough.

19:04.928 --> 19:07.848
I'm guessing
that the different mixes,

19:07.916 --> 19:09.682
like, you've got
your flaky biscuits,

19:09.818 --> 19:14.776
and you got your superduper
buttermilk whatevers

19:14.912 --> 19:18.376
you know, there's gonna be some
differences in those things.

19:18.512 --> 19:20.414
it may be that there's

19:20.447 --> 19:21.670
in one as opposed to another

19:21.738 --> 19:24.047
a certain amount of baking soda
in one as opposed to another

19:24.081 --> 19:28.157
that would make it more prone
to building that high pressure.

19:28.224 --> 19:31.145
the tins are meant
to be refrigerated,

19:31.213 --> 19:35.356
so we'll keep 'em in a cooler
until the experiment begins

19:35.423 --> 19:38.480
I had an idea that it's not only
the car's temperature,

19:38.684 --> 19:41.809
but potentially
the freshness of the biscuits

19:41.875 --> 19:44.593
that might've contributed
to their exploding

19:44.661 --> 19:46.970
um, to that end,
we've had this one out

19:47.174 --> 19:49.144
for 10 days.

19:49.212 --> 19:51.317
and we'll put that in

19:51.385 --> 19:54.509
to see if it explodes faster

19:54.712 --> 19:59.264
step two...
mounting the tins in the car.

20:01.233 --> 20:02.592
I was thinking,
just in terms of being able

20:02.728 --> 20:05.648
to get a reasonable spread,
maybe a rack of six?

20:09.790 --> 20:10.878
maybe for fun,

20:11.013 --> 20:13.866
we should make a thing
like a holster,

20:14.002 --> 20:16.040
like, shotgun shells,
like you're in a...

20:16.108 --> 20:17.059
like you're in a...

20:17.194 --> 20:19.097
nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!

20:21.066 --> 20:22.899
right, wearing it
under your vest

20:23.103 --> 20:25.072
for going through
airport security

20:29.012 --> 20:30.982
step three...

20:31.186 --> 20:33.427
determining
the right baking temperature.

20:33.631 --> 20:37.570
so, it's a rare sunny day
in San Francisco

20:37.639 --> 20:40.831
the skies look really clear,
and it's 9:00 on the nose.

20:40.966 --> 20:42.868
we're gonna place
a thermometer in my car.

20:43.072 --> 20:44.974
We're gonna check back
in a couple of hours

20:45.109 --> 20:47.078
and see where we can get
the temperature to.

20:50.476 --> 20:52.921
it's no coincidence
that the biscuit bullet story

20:52.987 --> 20:56.316
first started making the rounds
in the summer of '95,

20:56.520 --> 20:58.761
one of the hottest summers
on record.

21:01.342 --> 21:02.972
so it's about 3:00.

21:03.108 --> 21:04.942
the car's been sitting
out here all day

21:05.010 --> 21:07.048
with the thermometer in it.

21:07.184 --> 21:10.044
the temperature's hovering
right around 140 degrees.

21:10.249 --> 21:13.857
to ensure a consistent
baking temperature,

21:14.061 --> 21:18.215
we're gonna bring the car inside
and heat it artificially.

21:24.957 --> 21:27.067
so, Adam, let's load this thing.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.770
okay.

21:28.975 --> 21:31.970
I'm hoping we see a pretty
significant change in the heat

21:32.039 --> 21:34.082
kind of fast.

21:34.150 --> 21:36.125
well, it ought to.

21:36.193 --> 21:40.279
these are radiant heaters,
so, you know, it's...

21:40.346 --> 21:42.389
this is like the pure form
of what the sun gives

21:42.458 --> 21:45.931
as far as just
what actually heats it up.

21:45.931 --> 21:49.472
we're up to 105.8.
it's looking good.

21:49.677 --> 21:51.992
maybe another 15 or 20 minutes.

21:52.128 --> 21:54.648
it's gonna be hot in there.

21:54.716 --> 21:56.623
I don't know
if you want to sit in the car,

21:56.691 --> 21:58.393
you know,
wait for the biscuit dough,

21:58.666 --> 22:00.504
or if I sit in the car,
maybe we take turns.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.731
all right.

22:01.866 --> 22:05.612
I think prom about a foot away,
it's totally safe for us

22:05.679 --> 22:08.540
to be able to be
the subjects in the car.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.536
I wouldn't load my shorts full
of these things in a hot car.

22:11.603 --> 22:14.805
that's a scary thought.

22:16.303 --> 22:18.483
it's starting to smell
really strong of, like,

22:18.687 --> 22:20.526
almost burning plastic in there,

22:20.729 --> 22:22.636
so I don't think either of us
should sit in there.

22:22.772 --> 22:24.815
I just made up a rack
we'll just put the head in.

22:24.951 --> 22:26.586
all right?

22:26.655 --> 22:28.493
you mean, you don't want to
get hot, is what you're saying?

22:28.697 --> 22:30.945
you can go climb in there,

22:31.080 --> 22:33.600
but it's... you could suffocate.

22:35.031 --> 22:38.162
120 degrees.
time to get baking.

22:38.299 --> 22:39.116
are you ready?

22:39.252 --> 22:40.409
- yeah.
- okay.

22:40.614 --> 22:43.338
leading brand, flaky.

22:43.338 --> 22:45.517
leading brand, buttermilk.

22:45.721 --> 22:48.173
competitor, flaky.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.284
competitor, buttermilk.

22:50.489 --> 22:52.940
unrefrigerated.

22:53.076 --> 22:55.527
small tin.

22:55.595 --> 22:56.890
all right.

22:57.094 --> 22:59.954
and the clock is ticking.

23:03.563 --> 23:06.900
I'll say within eight minutes.

23:06.968 --> 23:10.236
two hours, maybe three.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.416
- really?
- yeah.

23:13.709 --> 23:15.957
so...

23:16.094 --> 23:19.634
to eight minutes than two hours?

23:19.838 --> 23:22.222
so we're saying
8 minutes or 120 minutes.

23:24.197 --> 23:26.580
all right, I'll put
a dollar down on that.

23:28.623 --> 23:30.870
- put it on the car.
- all right.

23:32.641 --> 23:35.569
now we wait?

23:35.569 --> 23:38.293
do we see
any physical change in them?

23:38.362 --> 23:40.813
no, I don't see
any change in them.

23:40.949 --> 23:42.992
your dashboard's
starting to melt, though.

23:44.422 --> 23:47.009
I've been working
in this area for about 30 years

23:47.078 --> 23:51.504
I've never heard of
this type of thing happening

23:51.573 --> 23:55.863
but as you think about it,
you've got the potential there

23:55.998 --> 23:58.587
because if you have enough heat,

23:58.722 --> 24:02.195
the pressure
that's created by the gas inside

24:02.331 --> 24:05.329
can cause that container to pop.

24:10.503 --> 24:12.547
do you think the Flaky's
are gonna go first

24:12.683 --> 24:13.976
or the buttermilk's?

24:14.113 --> 24:16.496
the small one's gonna go first
because it has less mass.

24:16.632 --> 24:20.855
it's gonna take at least
probably a half an hour

24:20.923 --> 24:22.898
for the interior of those things

24:22.966 --> 24:24.736
to show hardly
any change in temperature..

24:24.941 --> 24:27.324
Mmm, you're right,
they need to work through.

24:27.528 --> 24:29.844
yeah, I mean,
it's too much mass.

24:30.048 --> 24:32.567
it's still gonna be
way less than 120 minutes.

24:32.704 --> 24:34.338
we'll find out.

24:34.406 --> 24:37.608
the leavening agent
is sodium bicarbonate,

24:37.674 --> 24:42.714
and it is reacting
with an acid to product

24:42.850 --> 24:45.779
carbon dioxide... co2.

24:45.983 --> 24:48.502
if it is not released,

24:48.639 --> 24:51.158
you're going to create
pressure in that container,

24:51.226 --> 24:54.359
to the point where...
as the reaction continues..

24:54.563 --> 24:55.720
that container can burst.

24:57.150 --> 24:57.832
whoa!

24:57.899 --> 24:59.329
whoa!

25:00.488 --> 25:02.531
Jamie

25:02.667 --> 25:03.757
do you know what happened?

25:03.893 --> 25:04.574
what?

25:04.710 --> 25:06.753
it jumped out of the rack.

25:06.957 --> 25:08.931
that's the small can
that was in the rack.

25:09.204 --> 25:12.200
it jumped out of the rack
and into my cup holder.

25:12.338 --> 25:15.264
I'll be darned.
and so, where was our clock?

25:15.401 --> 25:17.307
Where were we at?

25:17.512 --> 25:19.079
We were at, like,
58 minutes on the nose.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.258
So you won the bet then.

25:21.461 --> 25:23.369
Ah, yeah, in fact I did.

25:23.437 --> 25:25.412
I'd like to remove that one

25:25.480 --> 25:27.387
before it bakes dough
into my cup holder.

25:27.591 --> 25:30.860
Although I was right about
which one was gonna go first.

25:30.928 --> 25:32.971
You were absolutely right.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.895
whoa!

25:40.053 --> 25:42.096
that was kind of spectacular.

25:42.164 --> 25:45.637
we're missing a whole tin...
I don't even see it in there.

25:45.773 --> 25:47.748
Adam, which tin was it?

25:47.885 --> 25:51.221
that was the unrefrigerated.

25:51.358 --> 25:55.307
that was
the unrefrigerated flaky dough.

25:57.009 --> 25:58.984
well, now, there you go...

25:59.188 --> 26:01.231
it blew the top
right off of that thing.

26:01.435 --> 26:04.500
that was the unrefrigerated
leading brand.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.020
this is stupefyingly boring,

26:07.088 --> 26:09.539
but, you know, things are
blowing up in my car.

26:09.607 --> 26:11.582
what could be better?

26:14.034 --> 26:16.009
whoa!

26:16.077 --> 26:18.187
it's 137 degrees right now.

26:18.392 --> 26:20.299
well, that seems
to be the butter zone..

26:20.435 --> 26:22.478
everything's happened
above 133 degrees

26:22.615 --> 26:24.658
we should do this in Vegas,
and then we can say,

26:24.725 --> 26:27.722
"I went to Vegas
and I blew some dough."

26:36.915 --> 26:39.911
whoa, ugh.

26:39.911 --> 26:41.545
oh, man.

26:41.681 --> 26:43.588
I definitely could understand

26:43.793 --> 26:45.699
how you'd mistake this
for brains... here.

26:45.767 --> 26:47.742
no, come on, come on.

26:47.810 --> 26:50.943
no, feel it, feel it.
agree with me.

26:51.148 --> 26:53.326
yeah, it's definitely brains.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.437
whoa!

26:55.506 --> 26:56.528
what, did another one go?

26:58.162 --> 26:59.659
no. did it look cool?

26:59.863 --> 27:02.043
- yeah, that one spewed.
- oh, man.

27:02.248 --> 27:03.474
that one spewed pretty good.

27:03.678 --> 27:05.721
that tin is just,
like, decimated.

27:05.789 --> 27:06.197
like, decimated.

27:06.401 --> 27:08.785
no, that one... that one
was pretty energetic.

27:08.989 --> 27:10.895
I saw what... it, like,

27:11.032 --> 27:13.090
ricocheted off
the back of your seat

27:13.158 --> 27:14.804
really?

27:15.010 --> 27:17.067
and you can see bits of it...
see that little speck...

27:17.137 --> 27:19.125
yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

27:19.263 --> 27:22.211
that might be our smoking gun.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.543
the guys thought
there might be a difference

27:24.680 --> 27:27.082
between flaky and buttermilk.

27:27.219 --> 27:29.688
seems they're wrong again.

27:29.688 --> 27:32.500
ho-ho, no!

27:32.569 --> 27:35.586
wow! that just went everywhere.

27:35.724 --> 27:38.605
I mean, I just saw it vaporize.
look, it's in the front seat.

27:38.672 --> 27:40.525
yeah, the whole can
landed in the front seat

27:40.730 --> 27:42.651
the whole can landed
in the front seat,

27:42.788 --> 27:44.709
which means it had
to come across this way,

27:44.778 --> 27:46.972
easily hitting the head.

27:48.413 --> 27:50.264
yes, there can be accidents,

27:50.401 --> 27:52.459
but I've never heard
of an accident like this.

27:52.528 --> 27:55.614
um, I wouldn't worry
about being hurt.

27:55.751 --> 27:59.112
I may have a premature
bursting of my container,

27:59.249 --> 28:02.130
but I wouldn't worry
about wounds from shrapnel

28:02.268 --> 28:03.364
from my dough.

28:03.570 --> 28:05.766
Course. I don't leave
my groceries in a car

28:05.971 --> 28:08.989
at 140 degrees Fahrenheit
or higher anyway,

28:09.126 --> 28:11.115
'cause there are
other problems we can run into

28:11.252 --> 28:13.790
with food products
and micro-organisms

28:13.997 --> 28:15.848
there you go.

28:16.122 --> 28:18.112
I mean, I think
we've definitively proved

28:18.317 --> 28:19.483
that this is entirely...

28:19.552 --> 28:21.678
not one plausible

28:21.816 --> 28:23.873
I think, without a doubt,
a can of biscuit dough

28:23.941 --> 28:26.068
has exploded in somebody's car.

28:26.136 --> 28:28.194
of biscuit dough will go off

28:28.262 --> 28:28.742
in a hot car, a can
of biscuit dough will go off

28:28.948 --> 28:30.594
within three hours,
three and a half hours.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.024
this is something
of a first for "Mythbusters"...

28:34.229 --> 28:36.767
we can show the myth
is physically possible,

28:36.973 --> 28:41.569
but there's no hard evidence
that it ever happened.

28:41.637 --> 28:42.949
I tried to track it down.

28:42.993 --> 28:44.260
I tried to find
the friend of the friend.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.842
I couldn't do it.
I tried to find the location

28:45.978 --> 28:47.380
where it actually happened...
I couldn't.

28:47.471 --> 28:49.280
I looked for police reports.
there were none.

28:49.325 --> 28:50.998
and truth is,
this didn't happen.

28:51.044 --> 28:52.536
there was no woman so stupid

28:52.627 --> 28:54.707
that she thought she was
holding raw dough on her head,

28:54.843 --> 28:55.838
and that's kind of nice to know.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.876
so, the falling lawyer.
what's the story?

29:12.013 --> 29:14.479
well, the story goes that,

29:14.615 --> 29:18.314
there was a lawyer on the 24th
floor of a high-rise.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.506
he was showing off,

29:20.643 --> 29:23.725
showing off his masculinity
and his bravery

29:23.862 --> 29:25.574
in front of some kind of class.

29:25.644 --> 29:28.588
he'd bounced up against
this plate-glass window,

29:28.656 --> 29:30.986
maybe trying to have some fun.

29:31.054 --> 29:33.589
and he did it repeatedly
and had no problem

29:33.794 --> 29:35.163
and then he did it again,

29:35.368 --> 29:37.423
and this time,
he simply went through.

29:37.492 --> 29:39.684
and down this guy goes,

29:39.821 --> 29:42.766
falling 24 floors
from his office to the ground,

29:42.834 --> 29:44.068
' and he promptly dies.

29:46.533 --> 29:50.575
our task is to prove whether
this is possibly or not.

29:50.712 --> 29:53.314
so what are the elements we're
gonna need to replicate this?

29:53.383 --> 29:56.191
we'll,'we're gonna need
a pane of glass,

29:56.327 --> 29:57.492
we've got to build
a mock-up body

29:59.410 --> 30:01.534
we have to create
some sort of a track.

30:01.739 --> 30:06.602
and a means of loading
this dummy body.

30:06.739 --> 30:08.656
we'll probably use some, um...

30:08.794 --> 30:10.644
I've got a bunch
of surgical rubber tubing

30:10.711 --> 30:11.739
that we can make
a big slingshot.

30:11.945 --> 30:12.835
okay.

30:12.972 --> 30:16.670
and we'll have to also rig
various ways of measuring

30:16.808 --> 30:18.314
so we're consistent about it...

30:18.520 --> 30:20.575
how much force

30:22.834 --> 30:24.753
whether or not it's possible

30:24.959 --> 30:26.877
for a person running
at a reasonable clip

30:27.013 --> 30:29.959
into the window has enough
pounds of force behind him

30:30.026 --> 30:31.123
to actually break the window.

30:33.658 --> 30:35.233
the first reaction
is complete disbelief.

30:35.438 --> 30:37.013
and then the second reaction is,

30:37.218 --> 30:39.821
"well, I heard that happened
in New York or Moscow

30:40.027 --> 30:42.082
or Hong Kong,
or something like that.

30:42.150 --> 30:44.068
it's just one of those stories

30:44.137 --> 30:47.287
that seems to have
kind of gone around the world.

30:52.013 --> 30:54.958
first we need to decide
what kind of track it is,

30:55.164 --> 30:57.083
whether we want... I'm thinking
that we should roll it

30:57.219 --> 30:59.137
along the ground
kind of track...

30:59.342 --> 31:01.397
you've got that...
you've got the great...

31:01.603 --> 31:02.904
the dolly truck
with the skateboard wheels.

31:02.972 --> 31:03.520
okay.

31:03.658 --> 31:05.986
that's got
a really low friction.

31:12.561 --> 31:15.164
I've only broken
one bone in my body.

31:15.233 --> 31:17.287
my neck.

31:17.356 --> 31:20.507
so, how to build a lawyer.

31:20.644 --> 31:24.479
we're going to assume
that this guy wasn't a fat cat.

31:24.617 --> 31:27.904
we'll make him, say. 160 rounds.

31:28.041 --> 31:30.507
they're gonna be about...
call 'em 20 pounds apiece.

31:30.644 --> 31:34.822
20 pounds each,
so it's gonna be 8.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.521
now I'm about
to weld a steel frame

31:38.657 --> 31:42.835
that'll hold up the sand bags,

31:43.041 --> 31:46.808
to distribute their mass
roughly like a person's bod y.

31:51.465 --> 31:54.273
these wooden blocks
will stop our lawyer

31:54.343 --> 31:56.398
from falling backwards
when he accelerates

31:59.069 --> 32:01.124
when the cart stops
' '

32:02.151 --> 32:07.904
on to the next task...
finding the right pane of glass.

32:08.041 --> 32:09.959
something that would be suitable

32:10.095 --> 32:12.561
for the 24th floor
of a skyscraper.

32:12.767 --> 32:15.918
it's normally a thickness,
which is greater

32:15.987 --> 32:19.342
than the thickness
that you see in house glass.

32:19.411 --> 32:23.179
you're talking about
6 millimetre or 10 millimetre

32:23.247 --> 32:27.288
at three-quarters of an inch,
this 4-foot by 8-foot pane

32:27.288 --> 32:30.371
seems to be the standard size.

32:30.371 --> 32:31.945
we successfully have
a piece of glass

32:32.151 --> 32:34.137
for the falling lawyer...
thanks.

32:36.740 --> 32:39.411
I think I'll build the frame
out of just plywood,

32:39.548 --> 32:42.083
and we'll seal it up
with some caulk,

32:42.289 --> 32:43.727
just like you would an aquarium.

32:43.932 --> 32:45.987
and we may want to...

32:46.193 --> 32:49.686
we'll put the tempered glass
on the front

32:49.754 --> 32:52.219
look at that.

32:54.753 --> 32:57.288
yeah, okay.

32:57.357 --> 32:59.275
could have counted "three."

32:59.411 --> 33:01.466
glass comes in sealed units,

33:01.535 --> 33:04.823
and they're set into...
into recesses in frames.

33:04.891 --> 33:08.726
so that they're supported around
the total perimeter usually.

33:10.096 --> 33:13.042
our frame won't
just support the glass...

33:13.179 --> 33:15.712
it'll also allow us to reproduce

33:15.782 --> 33:20.234
some of the forces at work
inside tall buildings.

33:20.370 --> 33:22.289
and then we also have
to think of things

33:22.425 --> 33:24.274
like, if there's
pressure in the building,

33:26.467 --> 33:30.439
or that would either tend to,
you know, make things different.

33:30.507 --> 33:32.562
inside of a building, there's
a lot of things happening.

33:33.521 --> 33:35.850
there's mechanical equipment
which is exhausting,

33:35.918 --> 33:38.726
exhausting air,
and there's mechanical equipment

33:38.863 --> 33:40.781
which is pushing air
into the building.

33:40.987 --> 33:44.344
and if you don't get
the same amount of air going out

33:44.480 --> 33:46.398
as you're pushing in,

33:46.604 --> 33:48.932
then you start to build up

33:49.070 --> 33:51.330
this stack effect

33:51.466 --> 33:55.028
is just 1.47 pounds
per square inch,

33:55.028 --> 33:57.426
but we think
that's going to be crucial.

33:57.562 --> 34:02.357
because the glass has...
it's, like, 4,600 square inches.

34:02.426 --> 34:05.303
the amount of force...
there's not much of a...

34:05.439 --> 34:07.357
yeah, well,
you wouldn't think so,

34:07.425 --> 34:09.891
but it's a funny thing
about pressures like that.

34:10.166 --> 34:12.905
when you're thinking
in terms of PSIs

34:13.042 --> 34:15.097
and so on, it adds up.

34:15.166 --> 34:19.411
even a very small fraction

34:19.411 --> 34:21.261
starts to get into
1,000 pounds...

34:21.398 --> 34:23.315
oh, right across
the whole face of the glass,

34:23.522 --> 34:25.438
so it could've played
a significant factor

34:25.577 --> 34:27.083
in the window's breaking
on the pressure pump up.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.054
4,600 pounds of pressure

34:31.193 --> 34:34.138
is definitely something
we want to factor in.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.152
so that means that our frame

34:37.219 --> 34:39.891
that the window's going in
actually has to...

34:39.960 --> 34:41.603
pressure chamber. oh, okay.

34:42.768 --> 34:43.659
right, we'll seal it off
in the back,

34:43.864 --> 34:47.014
and we'll hook a vacuum
or a rressure rumr ur to it.

34:48.590 --> 34:51.125
Jamie doesn't have
a pump large though

34:51.330 --> 34:53.385
to increase
the air pressure in the shop.

34:53.453 --> 34:57.426
instead, he'll reproduce
the stack effect

34:57.632 --> 35:00.440
b y sucking air
out of the chamber.

35:00.577 --> 35:03.454
[pump whirs]

35:03.522 --> 35:06.330
I can see the plex bowing.

35:06.330 --> 35:09.275
this pump is too powerful.

35:09.275 --> 35:13.179
it's threatening to rip the
plexiglass out of the chamber.

35:14.960 --> 35:19.070
and our vacuum gauge
isn't sensitive though

35:19.138 --> 35:21.193
you know,
what I think we should do

35:21.467 --> 35:23.522
is that we should just rig
our own gauge

35:23.591 --> 35:24.275
our own gauge

35:24.343 --> 35:25.713
in terms of inches of water.

35:25.919 --> 35:28.453
I believe inches of water
is gonna be a lot more sensitive

35:28.659 --> 35:30.714
than inches of mercury
because it's a lot lighter

35:30.782 --> 35:33.659
than what mercury is.

35:33.659 --> 35:36.193
I mean, it's literally...
we can put a tube in there,

35:36.331 --> 35:38.248
like, a U-shaped tube.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.618
it's just like a barometer.

35:39.755 --> 35:40.508
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:40.714 --> 35:42.632
and that's the kind of scale
that we're dealing with

35:42.769 --> 35:45.028
- is like barometric pressure.
- right.

35:45.166 --> 35:47.221
it'll be an interesting thing
for us to know.

35:47.494 --> 35:50.714
with a tube of water, we'll get
all the sensitivity we want.

35:50.714 --> 35:52.494
all right.

35:52.631 --> 35:56.673
so, it should be
about four inches of water

35:59.206 --> 36:01.467
no, no, no, oh, point...
oh, yeah, you're right.

36:01.536 --> 36:02.494
you're right.

36:02.700 --> 36:04.687
that's magnificent.

36:04.893 --> 36:06.742
we've rigged
this leaf blower to suck.

36:06.948 --> 36:09.139
hooked up to a variable switch,

36:09.207 --> 36:13.112
it should also be easier
on the plexiglass.

36:13.317 --> 36:15.851
there we go.

36:15.988 --> 36:17.632
all right, you want... okay.

36:17.769 --> 36:20.509
I'll tell you
when we're.. let's see here.

36:22.632 --> 36:24.687
we've got sensitivity, baby.

36:24.755 --> 36:26.810
keep going.

36:26.879 --> 36:27.974
keep going.

36:28.043 --> 36:30.714
little more,
little more, little more.

36:30.850 --> 36:34.344
Scotty, I need power!

36:36.537 --> 36:37.358
- you want more?
- more!

36:37.427 --> 36:39.481
- more?
- more!

36:39.686 --> 36:41.674
three inches of water.

36:41.879 --> 36:44.756
yes! little more!

36:44.893 --> 36:46.672
- oh, that's it!
- is that it?

36:46.811 --> 36:50.440
that's it... 145 negative psi.

36:53.523 --> 36:55.782
we've proved the principle.

36:55.919 --> 36:58.660
now, with the addition
of some glass tube,

36:58.728 --> 37:01.125
a scale, and food d ye,

37:01.194 --> 37:02.700
we have a working gauge.

37:02.769 --> 37:04.755
Mr savage, if I could suggest

37:04.824 --> 37:07.837
that you put a drop
of the colouring in there first.

37:07.907 --> 37:09.756
no, I was thinking
I'd put it in after,

37:09.960 --> 37:12.358
and then I'd go...
and, like, mix it up.

37:12.427 --> 37:13.933
I thought
that would be kind of cool.

37:14.002 --> 37:14.893
ah, okay.

37:14.961 --> 37:17.769
with the stack-effect
problem solved,

37:17.975 --> 37:21.125
it's time to rig the slingshot.

37:21.331 --> 37:23.043
Blech!

37:23.523 --> 37:26.331
we'll rig our slingshot
somehow on...

37:26.468 --> 37:29.071
we can tie
to the side of the shop

37:29.207 --> 37:31.057
or something like that.

37:33.386 --> 37:35.920
so I was thinking for...
to figure out his velocity,

37:36.126 --> 37:37.975
to figure out
how fast he's travelling..

37:38.181 --> 37:40.098
we don't have a radar gun
or anything like that...

37:40.303 --> 37:42.290
I was thinking
we could take some flats

37:42.358 --> 37:44.345
and actually grid them,

37:44.412 --> 37:47.358
and then shoot from the side
with one of the cameras.

37:47.427 --> 37:52.154
which give us
25 frames per second.

37:52.359 --> 37:54.687
and then we can

37:54.756 --> 37:57.085
we can frame-by-frame
through the tape

37:57.222 --> 37:59.276
and see exactly how fast
that he's travelling

37:59.345 --> 38:03.727
finally, everything's in place.

38:05.921 --> 38:09.825
there we go.
three yards, that's my bet.

38:09.961 --> 38:12.153
I'll guess that
it's gonna go at five yards.

38:12.222 --> 38:13.660
five yards?

38:13.797 --> 38:16.947
this would be cool
if I could see.

38:17.153 --> 38:18.934
[leaf blower whirs]

38:22.564 --> 38:24.550
- there we go.
- look at that.

38:24.619 --> 38:27.906
all right.
first run from one yard.

38:30.784 --> 38:34.139
nothing. three yards.

38:34.208 --> 38:36.262
there's my five bucks
going to hell.

38:39.756 --> 38:41.948
penalty, five yards.

38:46.468 --> 38:50.715
160 pounds
at 3 miles per hour...

38:51.263 --> 38:54.071
our lawyer just
isn't cutting the mustard.

38:54.139 --> 39:00.167
I think we're gonna
end up going to two bands...

39:07.017 --> 39:09.070
we're ready?

39:17.359 --> 39:18.915
two yards.

39:19.039 --> 39:21.652
go.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.145
three yards.

39:23.331 --> 39:24.762
go.

39:25.945 --> 39:27.874
even with two elastic bands,

39:28.061 --> 39:30.052
our lawyer is still
coming off second best.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.842
and all of this is...
is bowing backwards...

39:34.904 --> 39:35.714
right.

39:35.900 --> 39:40.441
...as this comes in for
a second, so it really isn't...

39:40.441 --> 39:42.246
all these things
aren't really making contact.

39:42.433 --> 39:44.797
five yards.

39:44.860 --> 39:45.730
there we go.

39:45.793 --> 39:47.099
oh!

39:47.223 --> 39:48.032
all right.

39:48.156 --> 39:50.085
there. are you read y?

39:50.272 --> 39:52.263
two, three, go.

39:54.503 --> 39:56.369
it is possible
that it's not possible

39:56.432 --> 39:57.302
that it's not possible

39:57.426 --> 39:59.293
for a person to throw
himself through the window.

39:59.418 --> 40:00.725
entirely plausible, but...

40:00.849 --> 40:02.592
through this window.

40:04.582 --> 40:06.449
but it may not be possible for

40:06.511 --> 40:06.840
a human to do that by himself.

40:08.930 --> 40:10.397
So far, we haven't had

40:10.665 --> 40:12.622
much lawyer friend

40:12.686 --> 40:15.295
to smash the glass,

40:15.425 --> 40:18.034
but Jamie's working on a hunch.

40:18.099 --> 40:20.055
I'd be inclined
to put all the steel bags...

40:20.251 --> 40:22.075
all the sand bags up high.

40:22.272 --> 40:24.097
yeah, exactly.
I mean, starting here.

40:24.227 --> 40:26.183
two, four, six, eight.

40:26.248 --> 40:28.661
redistributing
the weight up high

40:28.791 --> 40:29.900
will concentrate the impact.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.922
Meanwhile,
our structural engineer

40:32.052 --> 40:35.051
is working
on a different theory.

40:35.116 --> 40:37.919
Glass is
an unpredictable material.

40:37.985 --> 40:40.527
and although we use it,

40:40.658 --> 40:44.179
and we see it
performing very well

40:44.244 --> 40:46.853
in thousands of cases,

40:46.917 --> 40:49.134
there are certain things
which will cause it

40:49.330 --> 40:50.765
to act in a way we don't expect.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.590
all right, so this is one yard.

40:52.656 --> 40:54.481
two, three, go.

40:56.372 --> 40:58.849
if there's nicks in glass,

40:58.914 --> 41:01.132
it tends to cause
what art called stress raisers,

41:01.327 --> 41:04.522
and so you can break
the glass with less force

41:04.653 --> 41:07.260
than you would a piece of glass
that isn't nicked.

41:07.326 --> 41:09.478
two yards.

41:12.932 --> 41:14.889
one, two, three, go.

41:17.823 --> 41:19.453
that seems better.

41:19.583 --> 41:21.409
- it's feeling pretty sturdy.
- yeah

41:21.605 --> 41:24.604
probably a thousand times,
nothing will happen,

41:24.735 --> 41:28.190
but you're dealing
with a very brittle material.

41:28.256 --> 41:30.082
and it doesn't
give you any warning.

41:30.212 --> 41:33.276
it doesn't bend like steel,
it doesn't bow like wood.

41:33.341 --> 41:36.341
it just goes kapump, and then
you're out on the street.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.689
three yards.

41:41.100 --> 41:42.469
- read y?
- ready.

41:42.535 --> 41:43.579
two, three, go.

41:46.251 --> 41:47.164
yeah!

41:55.640 --> 41:57.467
it worked.

41:57.597 --> 41:59.553
it did... from three yards.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.638
I won myself five bucks,

42:01.900 --> 42:04.377
wow.

42:04.573 --> 42:06.529
yeah, the distribution of mass
made a huge difference.

42:12.006 --> 42:12.528
listen to it...
it's like rice krispies.

42:12.658 --> 42:14.288
that didn't look
too fast to run at all.

42:15.005 --> 42:16.896
yeah, that wasn't excessive.

42:16.961 --> 42:18.852
very reasonable.
160 pounds, up on the torso,

42:19.047 --> 42:21.265
into a window
with negative pressure.

42:21.395 --> 42:23.221
nice.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.243
yep. that's not that far at all.

42:26.741 --> 42:30.915
Our lawyer covered 10 feet
in 1.8 seconds,

42:31.045 --> 42:35.805
which works out
at 5.7 miles per hour.

42:38.935 --> 42:42.390
You jumped like the bat
landed in your hairdo.

42:42.455 --> 42:45.389
even if it's double
the seven miles per hour,

42:45.585 --> 42:47.801
it's well within
the human's ability to run.

42:47.932 --> 42:50.148
And it seems totally possible

42:50.344 --> 42:52.170
with that pressure that
he could've broken the window.

42:52.365 --> 42:54.256
I'd agree.
it looked like what...

42:54.387 --> 42:56.017
probably the kind
of speed I'd get up to

42:56.082 --> 42:57.843
if I was launching
"at the wall, you know.

42:57.973 --> 43:00.711
Yeah, especially with only
three yards of start, you know.

43:00.777 --> 43:03.190
It's only nine feet, and you
can't really get up that fast.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.862
This is absolutely a true story.

43:05.992 --> 43:10.036
It happened at this location,
at this office tower behind us.

43:10.166 --> 43:12.057
The coroner
who investigated the incident

43:12.188 --> 43:14.208
decided not to hold an inquest

43:14.404 --> 43:16.164
because it was
such a freak accident

43:16.230 --> 43:19.489
and it would be extremely rare

43:19.620 --> 43:22.032
to imagine someone else doing
the same thing purposefully.

43:22.098 --> 43:23.206
That was fun.

43:23.402 --> 43:24.836
Yeah. that was fun.

43:24.966 --> 43:26.727
I like breaking things.

43:26.858 --> 43:29.205
Yeah, breaking things is cool.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.661
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
