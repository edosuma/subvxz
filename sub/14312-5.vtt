WEBVTT

00:03.008 --> 00:05.344
Sure, we've known each other
since we were kids.

00:05.511 --> 00:07.930
We were like best friends
or something.

00:08.096 --> 00:09.806
I guess people change.

00:14.019 --> 00:15.979
<i>First day back at school.</i>

00:16.146 --> 00:18.232
<i>I never knew so much could change
in just a couple...</i>

00:19.358 --> 00:21.235
<i>Was that...?</i>

00:23.529 --> 00:24.780
<i>Nothing.</i>

00:24.947 --> 00:26.240
<i>It was nothing.</i>

00:59.231 --> 01:02.150
Now, this is what I call
a big score.

01:02.317 --> 01:03.694
Funny, thought you had to know...

01:03.860 --> 01:06.113
...how to count
before you could keep score.

01:21.503 --> 01:23.380
Gotta love a villain
who can accessorize.

01:26.466 --> 01:31.430
What do you know?
Guess I really am a hardened criminal.

01:31.930 --> 01:35.684
Now how about a little trim?

02:40.916 --> 02:42.751
Are you sure
I look good in this light?

02:42.918 --> 02:45.212
You look good.

02:45.796 --> 02:50.884
First, a big thank you for
introducing me to my man Rand.

02:51.051 --> 02:53.387
Yeah. Thanks.

03:14.616 --> 03:17.661
My big score.

03:23.041 --> 03:24.376
Okay, What's that about?

03:24.543 --> 03:26.920
Oh, haven't you heard?
They're a couple.

03:27.087 --> 03:29.923
Oh, no, they're not!

03:30.549 --> 03:33.593
Lizzie, I can't, I won't let you do this.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.595
Breaking up with Flash was one thing,
but this is--

03:35.762 --> 03:39.099
Sal, stop.
Let me be happy, okay?

03:39.266 --> 03:41.017
It's not just me and Petey.

03:41.184 --> 03:45.564
- My big brother's back--
- Mark's back? Tight.

03:46.732 --> 03:48.692
I hear he was five months in juvie.

03:48.859 --> 03:50.694
It was six, actually.

03:50.861 --> 03:55.115
Hey, Mark. Long time no--
I mean, not that it's been that long.

03:55.282 --> 03:57.159
Easy Seymour, chill.

03:57.325 --> 03:58.702
It's sludge under the bridge, bro.

03:58.869 --> 04:01.955
Listen, Mark,
got 6-to-1 on a sure thing.

04:02.122 --> 04:04.374
- You in?
- I don't do that anymore.

04:04.541 --> 04:06.001
Well, do you have to hold his hand?

04:06.168 --> 04:08.712
You're turning off our
entire demographic!

04:08.879 --> 04:11.798
- You used to hold my hand.
- Still do, babe.

04:11.965 --> 04:15.177
- Oh, Kenny.
- What?

04:17.678 --> 04:19.139
Who needs her?

04:23.101 --> 04:27.355
- Hey, man. Name that cutie.
- Sha Shan Nguyen. Sophomore.

04:28.064 --> 04:33.612
- She's in your Bio class, man.
- Oh, she's in my bio-class, all right.

04:33.779 --> 04:37.908
So, Sha Shan, word is you don't have
an invite to the hottest party in town.

04:38.074 --> 04:41.828
Birthday bash
for Midtown's football hero, moi.

04:42.037 --> 04:45.081
And lucky you
gets to go as moi date.

04:45.248 --> 04:48.376
You can thank me at the party.

04:50.212 --> 04:52.047
<i>I can't get Eddie out of my head.</i>

04:52.214 --> 04:56.343
<i>But I swung past so quickly,
it could have been anyone. Or no one.</i>

04:59.304 --> 05:01.473
- Harry!
- Hey, Pete.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.142
Not exactly the greeting
I was expecting...

05:04.309 --> 05:07.145
...but who'd have guessed you'd
take up Kung Fu while I was gone.

05:07.312 --> 05:09.022
Sorry, man, sorry.

05:09.189 --> 05:11.191
- When did you get back?
- Last night.

05:11.358 --> 05:13.693
- Harry!
- Hey, Gwen.

05:13.860 --> 05:16.947
Man, I've missed you.
I mean, both of you.

05:17.489 --> 05:19.991
Harry, you remember Liz. We're...

05:20.158 --> 05:23.954
So I gather. Congrats!

05:29.209 --> 05:30.460
You coming, Pete?

05:32.003 --> 05:33.713
Don't want to miss Principal Davis'...

05:33.880 --> 05:36.466
...always-riveting
start-of-semester speech.

05:38.885 --> 05:40.011
Great memories.

05:40.178 --> 05:42.430
You and me
always giving 100 percent...

05:42.597 --> 05:45.934
...then giving a little more
to get the win.

05:53.775 --> 05:55.902
Surprised you'd show your face...

05:56.069 --> 05:58.780
...without anything sparkly
to make it palatable.

05:58.947 --> 06:02.742
Come on, Hammerhead,
just give me another shot.

06:02.909 --> 06:08.540
Well, maybe I got a couple ideas.

06:12.544 --> 06:14.921
And no tater-toddlers
will be served in the cafeteria...

06:15.088 --> 06:18.091
...until we go
one month without a food fight.

06:19.175 --> 06:22.429
Now, I'd like to introduce
this semester's two guest instructors.

06:22.596 --> 06:24.264
Directing this year's school play...

06:24.431 --> 06:29.102
...we're honoured to have Broadway star
St. John Devereaux.

06:31.062 --> 06:33.815
And conducting a special weekly
criminology seminar...

06:34.024 --> 06:36.902
...Captain George Stacy
of the New York Police Department.

06:37.068 --> 06:38.236
Give it up for the man.

06:38.778 --> 06:40.864
You must be proud.

06:42.073 --> 06:44.034
I'd be a little prouder
if I wasn't convinced...

06:44.200 --> 06:46.077
...he took the job
to keep a closer eye on me.

06:46.703 --> 06:49.581
- Can't blame him for that.
- Stop it.

06:49.956 --> 06:53.627
No, really.
When I was taking the Green...

06:53.793 --> 06:56.963
...you were the only one who noticed
I was in trouble and tried to help.

06:58.256 --> 07:02.802
All right, that wraps it up.
No running! No shoving!

07:02.969 --> 07:05.722
So I got an invite to Flash's
birthday party...

07:07.182 --> 07:10.268
...and I don't suppose
you'd be my date?

07:10.435 --> 07:11.853
Date?

07:12.020 --> 07:14.648
- Like a "date" date?
- Yeah, "date" date.

07:14.814 --> 07:16.816
"Date-date" date. Your call.

07:20.236 --> 07:23.490
- Sure. Why not?
- So, you guys wanna double?

07:23.657 --> 07:28.954
Sorry, Flash's ex, remember?
I wasn't invited.

07:29.496 --> 07:32.457
I was.
Not that I'm planning on going.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.169
He knows we're a couple
and he still invited you.

07:36.336 --> 07:38.672
- I guess he's cool with it.
- Yeah, right.

07:38.838 --> 07:40.507
Flash Thompson
is growing as a person.

07:40.674 --> 07:43.051
Well, what's your explanation?

07:43.218 --> 07:46.388
Then it's settled.
This Saturday, we're a foursome.

07:46.554 --> 07:48.598
- Great.
- Great.

07:54.437 --> 07:56.523
Wow, that was feeble.

07:56.690 --> 07:59.401
<i>What's your problem, Pete?
I mean, life's good.</i>

07:59.901 --> 08:03.279
<i>Aunt May's getting stronger every day.
You finally got a girlfriend.</i>

08:03.446 --> 08:07.534
<i>Maybe not the one you figured on,
but still. And, hey, Harry's back.</i>

08:07.701 --> 08:10.286
<i>I just hope he can stay off
the Globulin Green.</i>

08:10.453 --> 08:13.540
<i>Last thing I need is
the return of the Green Goblin.</i>

08:13.707 --> 08:17.794
<i>Only thing more horrifying is
double-date at Flash Thompson's.</i>

08:18.003 --> 08:21.381
<i>Or... Eddie Brock?</i>

08:22.007 --> 08:23.258
<i>Alarm.</i>

08:23.717 --> 08:27.554
<i>It's coming from the museum.
But Eddie... Gone.</i>

08:28.388 --> 08:33.268
<i>Man, I'm losing it. Goblin. Venom.
Who's next?</i>

08:33.518 --> 08:35.520
<i>Sandman.</i>

08:48.491 --> 08:52.412
How? How are you
always wherever I'm doing a job?

08:52.579 --> 08:56.166
What have you got, some kind
of spider-sense or something?

08:56.374 --> 08:57.542
Funny you should say--

09:03.131 --> 09:06.301
<i>Great. Needle in a haystack.</i>

09:06.468 --> 09:08.178
<i>I suppose it would be
a tad irresponsible...</i>

09:08.344 --> 09:11.681
...to <i>smash them all
just to find Sandman.</i>

09:21.024 --> 09:25.070
Hi. Thanks for allowing me
to share your special day.

09:25.236 --> 09:27.197
You will always mean
so much to me.

09:27.363 --> 09:29.157
Has anyone seen Petey?

09:43.171 --> 09:45.131
You keep getting in my way.

09:45.298 --> 09:48.051
Now, I got a buyer willing to pay
top-black-market-dollar...

09:48.218 --> 09:49.469
...for the Urn of Morpheus, here.

09:49.636 --> 09:52.847
And there's no way
I'm missing out on my big score.

09:59.062 --> 10:00.772
Are you taller?

10:05.860 --> 10:09.906
A little trick I picked up in prison.
I kept losing bits of sand...

10:10.073 --> 10:12.784
...so my lawyers made them
feed me raw silicates.

10:12.951 --> 10:15.203
I can absorb
as much of the stuff as I want.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.122
But that's not my only trick.

10:26.923 --> 10:28.925
Sandy, you're pathetic.

10:29.092 --> 10:31.719
- I'm pathetic?
- Totally.

10:31.886 --> 10:34.806
With your powers, you could do
some real good. Help people.

10:34.973 --> 10:39.310
But you waste it all on the same stupid
crimes Flint Marko committed.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.150
Gee, do you really think
I could be a hero like you?

10:45.316 --> 10:46.943
Well, yeah.

10:47.110 --> 10:50.446
- I mean, with great power comes--
- Gullibility!

10:53.616 --> 10:54.909
So long, chump.

11:13.595 --> 11:15.096
Nice car, Har.

11:15.263 --> 11:17.265
Welcome-home present from Mom.

11:17.432 --> 11:19.726
Hurry up, Petey. It's freezing.

11:19.893 --> 11:22.312
Then why put the top down?

11:22.478 --> 11:26.774
If we're showing up in a convertible,
we should show up in a convertible.

11:28.776 --> 11:30.862
0K8)'-

11:31.571 --> 11:33.364
Turn left at the corner.

11:34.365 --> 11:35.617
Now, stop.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.913
When you said
Flash lived just around the corner...

11:40.079 --> 11:42.624
...I didn't know you
meant just around the corner.

11:43.499 --> 11:47.587
Hey, big guy,
ready for your birthday kiss?

11:48.379 --> 11:50.715
Who invited the geek squad?

11:51.841 --> 11:54.302
Why's Puny Parker
crashing my party?

11:54.969 --> 11:57.263
You sent me an invitation?

11:57.430 --> 12:00.141
Sending invites wasn't my job,
it was...

12:00.308 --> 12:01.768
MQfn!

12:01.935 --> 12:05.355
Well, of course I invited Peter.
After all, he's your best friend.

12:09.442 --> 12:14.530
- That was in nursery school!
- Flash was part of the nerd herd?

12:14.697 --> 12:17.158
Who do you think
gave Eugene his nickname?

12:17.325 --> 12:19.244
And, hey,
it wasn't because he ran fast.

12:19.410 --> 12:22.413
I was 4, okay?

12:22.580 --> 12:23.748
MQfn!

12:28.461 --> 12:30.755
- You call that a castle?
- Yeah.

12:43.559 --> 12:45.853
- Kid's a witch!
- Yeah.

12:53.152 --> 12:55.446
- Mr. Sandman?
- Yes?

12:55.613 --> 12:57.949
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it, kid.

12:58.116 --> 13:01.369
Now, run along, it's getting cold out.

13:04.998 --> 13:10.295
Now you're nice to little girls?
I knew you was going soft.

13:11.337 --> 13:15.216
Had nothing to do with the girl.
I wanted to torment the teens.

13:17.719 --> 13:19.679
Just give me my payoff.

13:19.846 --> 13:21.723
- That's it?
- What'd you expect?

13:21.889 --> 13:24.475
That's what's left after
the big man took his cut...

13:24.642 --> 13:27.854
...and the Master Planner
collected his loan-out fee...

13:28.021 --> 13:29.981
...for your super-villain services.

13:30.148 --> 13:32.275
This was supposed to be
my big score.

13:32.442 --> 13:35.069
Then you're not thinking
big enough.

13:35.862 --> 13:38.948
That oil tanker?
Find a way to stop it.

13:39.115 --> 13:41.951
I got frogmen ready to drain it dry.

13:42.118 --> 13:48.416
All that crude, now that would make
for a big score.

13:51.711 --> 13:54.505
Captain, aren't we getting
a little close to the beach?

13:54.672 --> 13:57.842
Looks like the beach
is getting closer to us.

14:12.357 --> 14:16.778
You'll wanna abandon ship now!

14:18.446 --> 14:21.741
Your hair's gotten longer. It's nice.

14:23.242 --> 14:26.996
Other than that, doesn't seem like
much changed while I was gone.

14:28.581 --> 14:29.832
Just a few things.

14:29.999 --> 14:33.419
<i>How come those two
are suddenly so cosy?</i>

14:33.711 --> 14:36.964
<i>Pete, chill. You don't get
to be jealous. You're with Li--</i>

14:37.924 --> 14:39.008
Go ahead, Hobie.

14:39.175 --> 14:41.427
Sorry, Hobes.
Invoking best-friend privilege!

14:41.594 --> 14:45.056
See, Flash is my main man. Never
would have won state without him.

14:45.223 --> 14:47.225
And, dude, did he take a hit.

14:47.392 --> 14:49.227
Probably destroyed
his football career...

14:49.394 --> 14:51.104
...his chance
at a college scholarship...

14:51.270 --> 14:53.981
-...well, everything.
- Kenny.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.985
Hey, wanna see how many chips
I can fit in my mouth?

14:58.152 --> 15:00.321
You mean in addition to your foot?

15:00.488 --> 15:04.534
- Did either of you see Eddie Brock?
- No. Why?

15:07.745 --> 15:10.456
<i>He's gone.
Assuming he was ever here.</i>

15:10.623 --> 15:11.666
<i>Breaking news.</i>

15:11.833 --> 15:14.043
<i>The notorious Sandman
has been spotted attacking...</i>

15:14.210 --> 15:16.170
<i>...an oil tanker at Rockaway Beach.</i>

15:16.337 --> 15:17.755
<i>We'll have more on the hour.</i>

15:17.922 --> 15:22.427
<i>In the meantime, here's an oldie
but a goodie from the Chordettes.</i>

15:26.973 --> 15:30.393
Okay, Sandman, I know you're here.
And you're going down!

15:30.560 --> 15:33.062
I don't care how big you get.

15:34.981 --> 15:37.275
Oh, really?

15:45.408 --> 15:48.119
Yeah, Morn, of course I'm having fun.

15:48.286 --> 15:52.457
The party rocks.
Everyone's here. Almost.

15:52.623 --> 15:57.128
- Hey, Rand, you seen Sha Shan?
- Sorry, Romeo.

15:57.587 --> 16:02.091
I don't get it.
I'm Flash Thompson, hero, legend.

16:02.258 --> 16:06.929
Girls don't stand the Flash up.
They jump at a chance to...

16:07.388 --> 16:09.640
Mom! Turn that off!

16:19.984 --> 16:24.030
Wow, Sandy, I know a basketball team
that could really use a guy your size.

16:24.197 --> 16:25.990
Can you dribble
or do you just drool?

16:26.157 --> 16:29.243
Mostly, I slam dunk.

17:22.213 --> 17:25.508
That love-tap's just the beginning,
web-head.

17:32.223 --> 17:35.685
<i>Oh, great, how am I supposed
to beat up a beach?</i>

17:57.415 --> 18:02.295
Yeah, I can see. Call it off. Marko.

18:02.461 --> 18:04.672
Once a mook, always a mook.

18:04.839 --> 18:05.965
Get me out of here.

18:15.808 --> 18:18.019
- That all you got?
- Hey, it worked on Goliath.

18:23.774 --> 18:26.569
Don't suppose you'd consider
picking on someone your own size?

18:27.194 --> 18:31.365
Nope. Been wanting to
bug-squash you since the day we met.

19:00.645 --> 19:01.979
<i>Okay, how tough can this be?</i>

19:02.146 --> 19:04.357
<i>All Jack needed
was a beanstalk and an axe.</i>

19:24.418 --> 19:26.087
<i>No.</i>

19:26.629 --> 19:28.214
<i>Venom.</i>

19:29.048 --> 19:31.133
<i>He's got the Symbiote--</i>

19:31.967 --> 19:35.429
- Sandy, behind you--
- Yeah, like I'd fall for that.

19:35.846 --> 19:38.015
- Abandon ship!
- I'm trying.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.019
The tanker.

19:56.659 --> 19:58.953
<i>Fire on an oil tanker.</i>

19:59.120 --> 20:00.705
<i>Man, this just keeps getting better.</i>

20:01.372 --> 20:02.873
Get back!

20:03.040 --> 20:05.167
- Gotta get you off this tub.
- It's too late.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.794
She's gonna blow before she sinks.

20:10.172 --> 20:11.298
Sandman, stop! You--

20:17.012 --> 20:18.764
Saved them?

20:21.142 --> 20:22.643
I was just in it for the bucks.

20:22.810 --> 20:24.520
I never meant for this to happen.

20:25.980 --> 20:28.733
Wait! Sandy! Let go!

20:40.494 --> 20:45.291
<i>The heat from the explosion...
It must have glazed him.</i>

20:51.964 --> 20:53.299
You wanted a big score, Marko.

20:53.466 --> 20:57.678
Far as I'm concerned, you just scored
about as big as a man can.

21:06.771 --> 21:08.272
<i>I gotta be sure.</i>

21:08.439 --> 21:12.735
<i>This is where I buried the Symbiote.
Under a ton of cement.</i>

21:12.902 --> 21:16.447
<i>And it's undisturbed.
So I didn't see Venom.</i>

21:16.614 --> 21:19.867
<i>Maybe, Eddie's back,
maybe it's all in my head.</i>

21:20.034 --> 21:23.287
<i>Either way, without the Symbiote,
Venom's gone for good.</i>

21:24.371 --> 21:28.125
<i>Now my biggest problem will be
explaining where I went to Liz.</i>

21:34.423 --> 21:39.011
Knew if I made you paranoid enough,
you'd lead me right to the one I love.

21:40.846 --> 21:43.474
Thanks, bro.

21:47.478 --> 21:51.524
Hey, Flash, hope you don't mind me
crashing your party.

21:52.900 --> 21:57.071
Truth is, I plan on crashing
a lot of parties this year.

21:57.238 --> 22:03.619
So if you run into my bro, Pete,
tell him we will see him soon.
