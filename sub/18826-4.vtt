00:12.917 --> 00:16.250
- Today, let us remember

00:16.291 --> 00:20.375
that the tragic fire

00:16.291 --> 00:20.375
that destroyed our beloved café

00:20.417 --> 00:23.667
is an awesome opportunity

00:20.417 --> 00:23.667
to turn it into something cool

00:23.709 --> 00:25.583
and upgrade our social lives.

00:25.625 --> 00:28.417
- I know we all have ideas

00:25.625 --> 00:28.417
about how to rebuild,

00:28.458 --> 00:30.208
so let's fight

00:28.458 --> 00:30.208
over whose idea is best

00:30.250 --> 00:32.792
and then decide to do mine.

00:32.834 --> 00:35.208
May I present--

00:32.834 --> 00:35.208
- Why do you get to go first?

00:35.250 --> 00:37.083
- Simple.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.083
I own an easel.

00:37.125 --> 00:38.208
May I present--

00:38.250 --> 00:40.000
- So you brought

00:38.250 --> 00:40.000
that one from home?

00:40.041 --> 00:43.000
- This is my store easel.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.000
May I--

00:43.041 --> 00:44.333
- Don't you have one

00:43.041 --> 00:44.333
at school?

00:44.375 --> 00:46.333
- Okay, fine!

00:44.375 --> 00:46.333
I'm an easel guy.

00:46.375 --> 00:48.500
So what?

00:48.542 --> 00:51.417
I'm also an idea guy.

00:51.458 --> 00:56.083
Presenting--

00:51.458 --> 00:56.083
Ricky's Science of Sports Café.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.417
- Wow.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.959
That was a waste

00:57.458 --> 01:00.959
of all your easels.

01:01.000 --> 01:01.959
Now,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.792
envision a café

01:04.834 --> 01:07.625
where the tabletops look

01:04.834 --> 01:07.625
like soccer fields

01:07.667 --> 01:11.583
and the waiters only serve food

01:11.625 --> 01:12.750
with their feet.

01:12.792 --> 01:13.500
- Ew!

01:12.792 --> 01:13.500
- Feet?

01:13.542 --> 01:16.125
- Nasty.

01:16.166 --> 01:19.000
- I'm proposing

01:16.166 --> 01:19.000
a sports nutrition café

01:19.041 --> 01:21.750
that features

01:19.041 --> 01:21.750
a carbo-loading buffet,

01:21.792 --> 01:24.583
a protein shake bar,

01:21.792 --> 01:24.583
and...

01:24.625 --> 01:26.083
a cold-pressed juicery.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.625
Please clap.

01:30.667 --> 01:33.542
- They're holding their applause

01:30.667 --> 01:33.542
for my idea.

01:33.583 --> 01:36.709
What we need

01:33.583 --> 01:36.709
is an extreme sports café

01:36.750 --> 01:39.333
with an extreme mini-ramp,

01:36.750 --> 01:39.333
extreme cheerleaders--

01:39.375 --> 01:42.667
- Couldn't you at least have

01:39.375 --> 01:42.667
taken the pizza out of the box?

01:42.709 --> 01:45.375
- That's not just a pizza.

01:45.417 --> 01:47.959
That's the floor.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.417
This is gonna be the first café

01:49.458 --> 01:52.834
where you can not only eat

01:49.458 --> 01:52.834
off the floor--

01:52.875 --> 01:57.000
you can eat the floor.

01:57.041 --> 02:00.875
Mmm.

01:57.041 --> 02:00.875
Delicious floor.

02:00.917 --> 02:02.291
So when do we start building?

02:02.333 --> 02:04.333
- We're not building

02:02.333 --> 02:04.333
a pizza floor.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.208
- Well, we're

02:04.375 --> 02:06.208
definitely not doing science.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.333
- Soccer is the world's

02:06.250 --> 02:08.333
most popular sport.

02:08.375 --> 02:10.125
- You can't do sports

02:08.375 --> 02:10.125
without nutrition.

02:10.166 --> 02:11.500
- Why do I even come

02:10.166 --> 02:11.500

02:11.542 --> 02:12.625
They always end the same way.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.166
- Okay, really?

02:12.667 --> 02:14.166
- You know what?

02:14.208 --> 02:15.542
Stay out of this meeting.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.542
- Come on, seriously?

02:15.583 --> 02:17.875
Okay, do you not think

02:15.583 --> 02:17.875
that this is a dumb idea?

You can stop arguing.

02:23.083 --> 02:24.625
Your dad and I

02:23.083 --> 02:24.625

02:24.667 --> 02:25.959
what we're doing with the cafe.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.834
- Picture this.

The menacing feathers

02:28.875 --> 02:31.166

02:39.667 --> 02:45.291

02:58.625 --> 03:02.709
are you joking?

03:02.750 --> 03:05.166
Are you not joking?

03:05.208 --> 03:07.834
