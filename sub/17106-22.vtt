WEBVTT

00:02.399 --> 00:05.200
TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:05.240 --> 00:06.400
-You're not going to
get there today.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.639
That's what we're aiming for.

00:07.679 --> 00:09.320
-I don't need you telling
me to win nationals.

00:09.359 --> 00:10.640
Because that's just
not me, all right.

00:10.679 --> 00:13.240
-Except you came all the way
over here to say that.

00:13.279 --> 00:15.519
-Was that whole ignoring
me thing just an act?

00:15.560 --> 00:17.440
Is that teacher psychology
101?

00:17.480 --> 00:20.640
-I give my attention where
it's deserved.

00:20.679 --> 00:22.640
-Tell me you didn't just do that
to mess with Christian.

00:22.679 --> 00:23.160
-What?

00:23.199 --> 00:24.120
No.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.600
-This crush is officially
over.

00:40.479 --> 00:43.799
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.399
Close your eyes.

00:47.439 --> 00:51.799
Take a leap of faith, and
lead the way to life.

00:55.799 --> 00:57.320
This is my chance.

00:57.359 --> 01:01.280
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.359
-We all know that every four
years, the world's top

01:15.400 --> 01:18.319
athletes compete in
the Olympic games.

01:18.359 --> 01:21.319
But you may not know that the
ballet world equivalent is

01:21.359 --> 01:23.120
called the Prix de Fonteyn.

01:23.159 --> 01:26.120
-This year, the final is
to be hosted in Sydney.

01:26.159 --> 01:28.680
And in just a few moments,
we'll be hanging out with

01:28.719 --> 01:31.400
those talented youngsters who
have just been chosen to

01:31.439 --> 01:33.359
represent Australia.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.680
But first--

01:34.719 --> 01:37.040
TARA NARRATING: I have to admit,
being a winner feels

01:37.079 --> 01:38.599
pretty amazing.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.680
I know to be good one, you're
not allowed to be too pleased

01:40.719 --> 01:42.200
with yourself.

01:42.239 --> 01:43.799
Somehow, that's considered
bad form.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.719
And to be a good loser, you
have to pretend you're not

01:49.760 --> 01:51.079
disappointed.

01:56.239 --> 01:58.599
-You've had 48 hours grieving
time since the nationals.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.640
I'm assuming you've bounced
back by now.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.640
TARA NARRATING: But when the
competition is over, and we're

02:03.680 --> 02:06.480
separated into winners and
losers, are we all just

02:06.519 --> 02:09.318
pretending nothing's changed
when it actually has?

02:09.360 --> 02:10.639
-When does your dad get here?

02:10.680 --> 02:12.759
-Oh, a week before
internationals--

02:12.800 --> 02:15.719
no trophy wife, no step-brats.

02:15.759 --> 02:18.240
I can't remember the last
time that happened.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.800
-OK, tell them he's ready.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.159
It's time to go to record.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.400
-You OK mate?

02:34.439 --> 02:35.599
You're looking a bit pale.

02:46.479 --> 02:47.479
-Yes.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.280
It's that time again,
where dreams are

02:49.319 --> 02:51.680
shattered or fulfilled.

02:51.719 --> 02:53.520
Auditions start tomorrow
for the end of year

02:53.560 --> 02:56.360
concert of Peter Pan.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.800
Abigail, why the disinterest?

02:58.840 --> 03:00.800
-Well, the lead's going
to go to third years.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.240
-Not necessarily.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.400
The ones that get contracts with
the company will be going

03:04.439 --> 03:08.719
on tour, leaving you to pick up
the remaining roles, like

03:08.759 --> 03:10.159
the seagulls you are.

03:10.199 --> 03:12.199
BEN (OFFSCREEN): I
bagged Peter Pan.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.039
-Who has the most solo?

03:14.080 --> 03:15.039
-Captain Hook's probably
the most

03:15.080 --> 03:16.520
demanding in this version.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.080
People, this is your chance to
end the year on a high note,

03:19.120 --> 03:23.199
especially while or nationals
champs are away showboating.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.439
I want you to give it
your best shot.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.319
-So, let's just dish
the dirt, girls.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.680
What's it like being
friends and rivals?

03:32.719 --> 03:35.120
Any thumbtack in the
point shoes?

03:35.159 --> 03:35.960
-Oh no.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.319
Grace is an incredible dancer.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.400
She inspires me to be
better every day.

03:40.439 --> 03:41.800
-Aw, Tara says that.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.759
But she won the girls'
category.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.400
-You two are just
beyond adorable.

03:47.439 --> 03:49.159
-What about the boys?

03:49.199 --> 03:51.199
-Ah, well, Sammy and I don't
know each other well yet.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.800
But I have a lot of respect
for his ability.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.240
GAV (OFFSCREEN): That
true, Sammy?

03:55.280 --> 03:56.599
You've been pretty
quiet up there.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.599
-Sammy?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.520
-Sammy had an on camera
meltdown.

04:05.560 --> 04:10.319
But apart from that, we were
perfect ambassadors.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.639
You'll see when it airs
tomorrow night.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.599
I'm going to get dad
to stream it.

04:13.639 --> 04:16.199
-Well, I'm glad you're being
so mature about that.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.399
I did tell him how
unfair it was.

04:18.439 --> 04:21.240
-What's unfair?

04:21.279 --> 04:23.360
-He hasn't called you?

04:23.399 --> 04:26.279
He promised he was going
to ring you today.

04:26.319 --> 04:29.839
-I probably had my phone off.

04:29.879 --> 04:31.199
-A conference came
up in Dubai.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.800
He had to cancel his visit.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.319
I'm sorry, Grace.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.319
-Grace, will I see you at
the auditions tomorrow?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.839
-I thought us pre-champs were
meant to be focusing.

04:44.879 --> 04:46.199
-Well, I'll talk to Ms. Raine.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.720
But I think you can handle
a solo as well.

04:47.759 --> 04:50.240
I don't want you getting
bored again.

04:50.279 --> 04:52.160
-Um, what should
I audition for?

04:52.199 --> 04:55.040
-Mischievous and ill-tempered
on the outside, surprisingly

04:55.079 --> 04:56.160
loyal on the inside.

04:56.199 --> 04:57.279
I reckon you'd make a
great Tinkerbell.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.160
-Seriously, you were funny.

05:03.199 --> 05:04.759
It was funny!

05:04.800 --> 05:07.319
-I don't even remember
what I said.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.399
It's like a black
haze of shame.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.800
-So what I'm hearing is that
you want a party when your

05:11.839 --> 05:13.639
episode screens tomorrow.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.319
-It's your 15 minutes of fame.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.279
I'd laugh it up.

05:17.319 --> 05:17.720
BEN (OFFSCREEN): Excellent..

05:17.759 --> 05:18.800
Reed-o.

05:18.839 --> 05:21.120
I'll need your help
honoring our hero.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.800
-I've got audition prep.

05:23.839 --> 05:25.519
BEN (OFFSCREEN): OK.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.720
How about you, Tara?

05:29.439 --> 05:30.360
Tara?

05:30.399 --> 05:31.480
-Can you hear that, Sammy?

05:31.519 --> 05:36.079
It's like, it's like
a dull roar.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.279
[phone dinging]

05:45.360 --> 05:48.560
-Christian, look, no
guilt, obviously.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.399
But I've been a dutiful
pre-girlfriend for weeks now.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.639
You don't really want to spend
tonight in the studio, do you?

05:55.680 --> 05:57.120
-Why?

05:57.160 --> 05:58.439
Because I screwed up in the
nationals I should just throw

05:58.480 --> 06:00.519
the rest of the year
away as well?

06:00.560 --> 06:02.279
-Uh, didn't say that.

06:02.319 --> 06:03.639
Wasn't thinking it.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.800
Look, Christian, my only
conversation agenda was that I

06:06.839 --> 06:08.839
thought maybe we
could hang out.

06:08.879 --> 06:10.759
-Kat, you might be happy
hanging in the corps.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.600
But I'm going for Hook.

06:13.639 --> 06:14.800
You can try and be supportive.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.480
-The company's always meant to
take three guys, three girls.

06:21.519 --> 06:24.279
Now all of a sudden it's
one guy, one girl.

06:24.319 --> 06:25.800
-Yeah, but this is a rumor.

06:25.839 --> 06:27.399
-With substance.

06:27.439 --> 06:28.639
I mean, no one's left the
company this year.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.040
No one's injured.

06:30.079 --> 06:32.319
-Well, if the company's only
taking one guy, how do you

06:32.360 --> 06:33.600
know it won't be you?

06:33.639 --> 06:34.800
OLIVER (OFFSCREEN): It will
be Gareth or Duncan.

06:34.839 --> 06:37.360
I dance better than both
of them, combined.

06:37.399 --> 06:40.639
But they're the favorites, so.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.759
-So tomorrow the company's
sitting in

06:42.800 --> 06:44.240
on Peter Pan auditions.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.800
And your interview's in the
afternoon, which is when they

06:45.839 --> 06:47.079
hand out contracts.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.279
-One audition isn't going
to change anyone's mind.

06:49.319 --> 06:52.800
-Sensei, do you remember when
I was failing my exams?

06:52.839 --> 06:54.480
Now I'm in the internationals.

06:54.519 --> 06:55.519
-Wait.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.759
I thought for once this
was about me.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.360
-It is.

06:59.399 --> 07:03.240
You did that, the impossible.

07:03.279 --> 07:06.519
You are the best dancer
here at the academy.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.240
You can convince the company
they can't live without you.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.240
-I must have been desperate.

07:13.279 --> 07:15.199
He's so Ben.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.800
-You know, I'm, I'm thrilled
Christian's

07:17.839 --> 07:18.480
committed to ballet.

07:18.519 --> 07:20.439
I'm committed to ballet.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.439
I could be Tink.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.040
-You would be perfect
for Tinkerbell.

07:24.079 --> 07:24.839
-I know.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.279
-Um, it's kind of earmarked.

07:27.319 --> 07:29.399
Zach basically offered
it to me.

07:29.439 --> 07:32.040
-And how does that work?

07:32.079 --> 07:34.800
-I think he might be having
a Lolita moment.

07:34.839 --> 07:36.199
-Don't even joke about that.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.319
Zach's old and married.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.160
And it would be totally
wrong and gross.

07:39.199 --> 07:42.120
-And fictional.

07:42.160 --> 07:42.720
-We're going play cards.

07:42.759 --> 07:44.319
Can I deal you in?

07:44.360 --> 07:45.600
-What?

07:45.639 --> 07:49.120
For another round of Tara
and Kat versus Grace?

07:49.160 --> 07:50.480
Sounds super fun.

07:50.519 --> 07:52.439
[music playing]

08:10.279 --> 08:12.199
-Might be a little dark
for Tinkerbell.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.079
-Shouldn't you be rushing
home to wifey?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.199
-Well, Peter Pan's not going
to choreograph itself.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.839
And, uh, I actually booked
this studio.

08:20.879 --> 08:22.800
-Do you need any help
workshopping?

08:22.839 --> 08:24.240
I could be your dance monkey.

08:24.279 --> 08:26.160
[music playing]

08:31.839 --> 08:35.240
-So my dad's not flying over.

08:35.279 --> 08:35.759
-I'm sorry.

08:35.799 --> 08:36.799
That's rough.

08:38.639 --> 08:39.759
-He never was.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.519
He just occasionally
gets guilty, so he

08:41.558 --> 08:44.399
books a plane ticket.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.639
Not guilty enough to
get on the plane.

08:46.679 --> 08:48.559
But--

08:48.600 --> 08:51.600
-He must be very proud of you
for making the internationals.

08:51.639 --> 08:52.799
You should be proud
of yourself.

08:57.240 --> 09:01.159
-At leas you're here.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.320
-Whoa.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.759
Grace.

09:03.799 --> 09:04.480
-What?

09:04.519 --> 09:05.240
I won't tell anyone.

09:05.279 --> 09:06.039
-There's nothing to tell.

09:06.080 --> 09:06.639
I'm your teacher.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.159
You're my student.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.679
-Then why have you been giving
me all this special attention?

09:10.720 --> 09:12.840
-Grace, I want to
be very clear.

09:12.879 --> 09:15.200
Whatever you think is
going on is only

09:15.240 --> 09:16.440
happening in your head.

09:25.559 --> 09:26.440
-Zach.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.879
Hey.

09:27.919 --> 09:30.480
Listen, I'm working on a new
addition piece for tomorrow.

09:30.519 --> 09:31.840
Can you take a look?

09:31.879 --> 09:33.639
-Look, I've got a stack of
notes to go over at home.

09:33.679 --> 09:36.279
Why don't you, uh, why don't
you do your nationals solo?

09:36.320 --> 09:37.320
-Because--

09:37.360 --> 09:39.200
look, I'm going for Hook.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.159
I really want to nail it.

09:42.200 --> 09:42.840
-Don't worry about it.

09:42.879 --> 09:43.519
You're going to be fine.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.159
-Hey, uh, do you mind if I stay
in Kat's room tonight?

09:51.200 --> 09:54.120
Abigail's at her musical,
and, um--

09:54.159 --> 09:55.279
Grace?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.840
You OK?

09:57.879 --> 10:01.679
-You were right about the
whole thing with Zach.

10:01.720 --> 10:08.720
I just, I didn't realize how
wrong it was, um, until--

10:08.759 --> 10:10.120
what?

10:12.440 --> 10:13.600
-He tried to kiss me.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.600
-Come here.

10:18.639 --> 10:20.559
[music playing]

11:07.480 --> 11:09.799
-Ollie's auditioning for Hook?

11:09.840 --> 11:10.320
-What?

11:10.360 --> 11:11.600
Oh, um, yeah.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.240
Gar, I know I'm usually
your cheer person.

11:16.279 --> 11:18.519
But today's kind of
a big day for him.

11:32.639 --> 11:33.840
-Thank you so much for coming.

11:33.879 --> 11:35.240
I really appreciate
this opportunity.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.519
-See, I told you.

11:38.559 --> 11:39.799
Nerves had no place
here today.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.360
-I wasn't nervous.

11:42.399 --> 11:45.039
They're ready for
you in there.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.120
It's nice, their letting the
second years have a crack.

11:52.679 --> 11:53.840
-Good luck.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.320
-If you're sure what happened
really happened--

12:05.360 --> 12:06.320
-Trust me.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.399
It was pretty blatant.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.840
-Then you have to talk
to someone about it.

12:10.879 --> 12:13.320
-Zach made a mistake.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.600
I'm not going to ruin
his career over it.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.639
Will you come with me
to my audition?

12:21.679 --> 12:24.799
It'll be so much easier knowing
you're outside.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.240
-You're still auditioning
today?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.799
-Well, what do you
expect me to do?

12:28.840 --> 12:30.200
Hide under my bed?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.399
-Hey.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.120
So you were right.

12:38.159 --> 12:38.919
I've been--

12:38.960 --> 12:40.799
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Neglectful?

12:40.840 --> 12:43.720
Yes, yes, you have.

12:43.759 --> 12:45.399
-Can I make it up to you?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.159
-I have an audition in
a couple of hours.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.159
Although I'll probably just end
up in corps, anyways, so.

12:58.519 --> 13:01.240
So how was Captain Hook?

13:01.279 --> 13:03.639
And don't ever tell me
I'm not supportive.

13:03.679 --> 13:06.039
I dream of dating a pirate.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.440
-[laughing]

13:13.840 --> 13:16.799
-It's OK.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.799
You did the best you could.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.799
-Gareth didn't get a contract
either, also

13:22.840 --> 13:25.720
cried like a baby.

13:25.759 --> 13:29.240
-Ben wants to know if we're in
on the screen this afternoon.

13:29.279 --> 13:31.639
-I thought you made a
tool of yourself.

13:31.679 --> 13:32.799
-Yeah, I did.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.159
But, um, I thought I'd
still check it out.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.600
Because it's televised
nationally.

13:37.639 --> 13:39.639
-You realize that if I get
into the company, we're

13:39.679 --> 13:41.279
celebrating.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.240
And if I don't, then I'm not
going to feel like watching

13:43.279 --> 13:44.480
some lame TV show.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.200
-RSVP no.

13:50.240 --> 13:50.799
-Wow.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.639
Hot date.

13:52.679 --> 13:55.799
I sure am one lucky girl.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.080
-I was putting it off
because of the Prix.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.120
You should get your
license, too.

14:00.159 --> 14:02.279
-[laughing facetiously]

14:02.320 --> 14:03.200
-All right.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.240
Christian, are you ready?

14:04.279 --> 14:06.159
-I was born ready.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.679
-Now you follow me to start.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.200
Then I follow you.

14:15.559 --> 14:17.480
[music playing]

14:34.360 --> 14:34.840
-Good work, Grace.

14:34.879 --> 14:37.519
Thanks.

14:37.559 --> 14:38.799
-That's all you've got for me?

14:38.840 --> 14:40.600
Thanks?

14:40.639 --> 14:42.639
-That's been my standard
closing line today.

14:42.679 --> 14:47.039
-Well, I think I deserve
more than that.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.279
-Excuse me.

14:51.639 --> 14:53.799
-Why are you being
so cold to me?

14:53.840 --> 14:56.639
I get that you're scared,
and you need

14:56.679 --> 14:58.039
more time, or whatever.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.360
But don't ignore me.

15:01.399 --> 15:03.200
-Grace, I didn't tell
Ms. Raine about what

15:03.240 --> 15:04.519
happened last night.

15:04.559 --> 15:06.600
Because besides from not wanting
to embarrass you, I

15:06.639 --> 15:09.440
thought you may have realized
that you made a huge mistake.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.279
But you haven't.

15:11.320 --> 15:12.840
So as soon as I'm done
here I will be

15:12.879 --> 15:14.720
talking to your godmother.

15:14.759 --> 15:23.279
-[crying]

15:23.320 --> 15:24.480
-Grace?

15:28.200 --> 15:30.159
-He begged me not
to tell anyone.

15:30.200 --> 15:30.799
But you're right.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.279
I have to.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.440
-You going to go to Ms. Raine?

15:34.480 --> 15:35.559
-What if she doesn't
believe me?

15:35.600 --> 15:36.759
It's my word against his.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.360
And yours.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.799
She trusts you.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.039
If, if you could go to her, and
just say that I can't face

15:45.080 --> 15:47.399
her, it'll be so much
more convincing.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.080
-Uh, I wasn't there.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.159
I didn't see anything.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.480
-You saw how upset I was.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.480
And you know how much time I've
been spending with him.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.799
Unless you don't believe me.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.480
-It's just, Zach's always been
such a great teacher.

16:02.519 --> 16:03.279
-I know.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.480
I trusted him, too.

16:04.519 --> 16:06.480
But he doesn't care about us.

16:06.519 --> 16:07.840
It's all an act.

16:18.799 --> 16:20.320
-Go wheels!

16:20.360 --> 16:21.519
Big cinnamon rolls!

16:26.320 --> 16:28.480
-Can we do the advanced
circuit now?

16:28.519 --> 16:29.320
-Next lesson, mate.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.559
You did well.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.320
Give me one more minute.

16:37.639 --> 16:38.639
-Christian!

16:38.679 --> 16:40.159
INSTRUCTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, Christian!

16:40.200 --> 16:41.519
What are you doing?

16:41.559 --> 16:44.039
Stop the bike.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.440
Slow down!

16:45.480 --> 16:47.399
Watch it!

16:47.440 --> 16:48.399
Oy!

16:48.440 --> 16:49.600
Wait!

16:51.799 --> 16:53.600
KAT (OFFSCREEN): (SHOUTING)
Christian!

16:53.639 --> 16:54.799
Christian!

16:57.879 --> 16:59.639
-It's just dislocated.

16:59.679 --> 17:02.480
I've done it before, skating.

17:02.519 --> 17:04.160
Oh, look at you, all
cute and worried.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.358
-Yes, of course I'm worried.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.559
I just saw you face plant the
road for no apparent reason.

17:09.598 --> 17:13.799
I thought you were desperate
to play hook.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.319
Christian, what if it doesn't
heal in time?

17:16.358 --> 17:19.160
-Then it doesn't heal in time.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.799
Look, I didn't feel like
auditioning, anyway.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.680
So--

17:22.720 --> 17:24.118
-So hang on.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.640
You, you blew off the end of
year production, because you

17:26.680 --> 17:28.480
felt like deliberately crashing
a bike at 50ks an

17:28.519 --> 17:29.160
hour.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.720
-No, I didn't say that.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.640
Nurse Katrina, where
are you going?

17:32.680 --> 17:35.680
-You might need excuses and
gravel rash to protect your

17:35.720 --> 17:38.480
fragile male ego from
failing again.

17:38.519 --> 17:40.519
But I have an audition
to get to.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.480
[music playing]

17:54.839 --> 17:59.400
-You have a bright future
in the dance world.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.640
This was a very tough
decision.

18:04.839 --> 18:06.599
-Hey, there are other
dance companies.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.440
-No, there's the company.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.599
Then there's everywhere else.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.160
-OK, well, look, we'll just--

18:12.880 --> 18:14.240
don't take no for
an answer, then.

18:14.279 --> 18:16.599
Resit the audition.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.799
We can ask Ms. Raine if you
can repeat third year.

18:19.839 --> 18:23.160
And then we'd be in
the same class.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.200
-You and I don't belong
in the same class.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.359
It took me weeks to get
you to mediocre.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.640
You think you're a star now
because of the Prix.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.559
But you're not a 9.8.

18:31.599 --> 18:33.400
You're a seven.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.480
Everyone knows you're
a sympathy vote.

18:36.519 --> 18:38.359
-Is that everybody knows, or--

18:38.400 --> 18:40.759
or just you?

18:40.799 --> 18:42.119
Because you said before
it was all about me.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.480
But you liked it when
I was a loser.

18:44.519 --> 18:46.559
You liked it when I needed
you to train me.

18:49.279 --> 18:50.400
I don't want to be with
someone who can't

18:50.440 --> 18:52.640
handle being equal.

18:52.680 --> 18:53.559
-We're not equal.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.480
-Yeah, and there it is.

18:55.519 --> 18:56.799
-You're breaking up with
me the day I don't

18:56.839 --> 18:58.000
get into the company?

18:58.039 --> 19:00.599
I guess I deserve that for
dating a confused.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.839
ZACH (OFFSCREEN): What
happened to you?

19:11.880 --> 19:13.599
-Suddenly teacher of the year
gives a crap again.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.039
You know, I get it.

19:18.079 --> 19:20.559
You lost interest.

19:20.599 --> 19:22.400
Your personal project didn't
make it through the

19:22.440 --> 19:23.599
international, so moving on.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.799
-Days like this, I want
to be a gardener.

19:28.839 --> 19:30.440
Look, I know you were
disappointed.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.480
-I was fine the way I
was before, Zach.

19:33.519 --> 19:35.400
You didn't need to make me
think I could win when I

19:35.440 --> 19:36.440
didn't stand a chance.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.440
ZACH (OFFSCREEN): I said
you could win.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.599
And on the day of
the nationals,

19:39.640 --> 19:42.640
did you do your best?

19:42.680 --> 19:44.519
-I wanted it.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.799
I worked at it.

19:45.839 --> 19:47.279
-So you failed.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.640
Learn something, and
get over it.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.160
Because if you want this career,
it is knock back after

19:51.200 --> 19:52.400
knock back.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.480
And I care.

19:53.519 --> 19:54.839
I really do.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.559
But I can't be around every
time to hold your hand.

20:00.440 --> 20:05.200
[knocking]

20:05.240 --> 20:05.799
-I'm busy, Tara.

20:05.839 --> 20:08.799
Is it important?

20:08.839 --> 20:11.640
-It's about Grace and Zach.

20:18.519 --> 20:19.640
-I knew she'd believe you.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.799
Lucy sounded like she
was having a stroke.

20:21.839 --> 20:24.079
-Uh, she wants us
both to go in.

20:24.119 --> 20:26.359
-You are the best friend
that I've ever had.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.559
Thank you for this.

20:32.519 --> 20:33.640
What is he doing here?

20:36.440 --> 20:39.720
Lucy, can I talk to
you, just us?

20:39.759 --> 20:41.720
-Grace, Tara came to me because
she was worried about

20:41.759 --> 20:44.599
you, about what you said
happened with Zach.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.440
-What I said?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.440
I told you it's what happened.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.079
-Zach and I have spoken.

20:52.119 --> 20:54.640
And he said how you got
confused, and tried to--

20:54.680 --> 20:56.480
-I'm the victim here.

20:56.519 --> 20:58.200
-Grace, it's OK.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.799
We're all here because
we want to help you.

20:59.839 --> 21:01.799
-How could you take his side?

21:01.839 --> 21:03.799
I trusted you.

21:03.839 --> 21:04.759
-Tara, you can go now.

21:04.799 --> 21:07.119
And this does not
leave my office.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.759
-Lucy, OK, I admit
it's a joke.

21:13.799 --> 21:15.640
You're blowing this
out of proportion.

21:21.079 --> 21:24.240
-So Zach's letting me
audition next week.

21:24.279 --> 21:25.640
Depending on my shoulder
there.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.119
It was good lesson.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.319
Don't ride angry.

21:29.359 --> 21:30.319
That surprised you

21:30.359 --> 21:34.319
the price for -Nope.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.640
-I guess you're going to be
mad at me for a while now.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.119
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Oh yeah.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.160
SLADE (ON TV): Well, uh, Sammy
and I don't really know each

21:40.200 --> 21:41.279
other that well yet.

21:41.319 --> 21:43.359
But I have lot of respect
for his ability.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.480
GAV (ON TV): That true, Sammy?

21:45.519 --> 21:47.160
You've been pretty
quiet down there.

21:50.319 --> 21:52.480
LENA (ON TV): Sammy?

21:52.519 --> 21:57.559
SAM (ON TV): Um, actually, Lena,
Slade and I can't stand

21:57.599 --> 21:58.480
each other.

21:58.519 --> 21:59.480
LENA (ON TV): Really?

21:59.519 --> 22:00.920
Intriguing.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.319
SAM (ON TV): Yeah, he has a
signature head band, and he

22:02.359 --> 22:03.799
tried to sabotage
my performance.

22:03.839 --> 22:05.640
SLADE (ON TV): No I didn't.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.640
It was a misunderstanding.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.039
GAV (ON TV): The underbelly
of the ballet.

22:09.079 --> 22:09.799
And here's the guest of honor.

22:09.839 --> 22:10.640
Welcome

22:10.680 --> 22:11.319
LENA (ON TV): You won, Sammy.

22:11.359 --> 22:12.319
-Oh, no, guys.

22:12.359 --> 22:14.079
Can we please watch
something else?

22:14.119 --> 22:15.200
SAM (ON TV): Yeah,
I was having--

22:15.240 --> 22:16.200
-There's going to be some
celebs in rehab

22:16.240 --> 22:17.240
that need our attention.

22:17.279 --> 22:18.480
SAM (ON TV): My dad was
in the audience.

22:18.519 --> 22:19.680
And he hasn't watched
me dance.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.640
-Are you OK?

22:25.680 --> 22:27.599
-I've just talked to dad.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.039
In 38 hours, he'll be picking
me up from Heathrow.

22:31.079 --> 22:33.400
Then I'll be reinstalled in
the north wing with the

22:33.440 --> 22:35.240
step-brats.

22:35.279 --> 22:37.839
-You must have felt like we
ambushed you, though.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.640
-You totally did the
right thing.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.440
Zach's an awesome guy.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.559
-Then why did you
lie about him?

22:45.599 --> 22:49.480
-Partly boredom, and partly an
experiment to see if you'd

22:49.519 --> 22:51.200
stand up for me.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.799
Friend fail.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.799
-I couldn't do that when
I wasn't sure.

22:54.839 --> 22:56.640
-See, that's the difference.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.279
I would have lied for you.

22:59.319 --> 23:03.559
Oh, and, um, at the nationals,
I'll let you win.

23:06.680 --> 23:07.759
SAM (ON TV): Track two.

23:07.799 --> 23:09.279
I just want to reenact
a critical moment.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.599
KAT (OFFSCREEN): This
is priceless.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.319
SAM (ON TV): See,
I'm up on stage.

23:17.359 --> 23:19.160
And then the music
just cuts out.

23:19.200 --> 23:22.359
Hey, Slade, do the part where
you pull the cord.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.720
So then the music stops.

23:24.759 --> 23:27.400
Dead silence.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.400
And I'm freaking out
at this point.

23:29.440 --> 23:33.440
I am, just, I don't
know what to do.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.720
So I just, I started
dancing again.

23:34.759 --> 23:36.680
-Grace just left for London.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.440
-Oh, why?

23:38.480 --> 23:41.160
-I don't think she's
coming back.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.559
SAM (ON TV): I just
kept going.

23:42.599 --> 23:43.799
TARA NARRATING: I don't know
why we have to pretend we

23:43.839 --> 23:46.799
don't care about winning.

23:46.839 --> 23:49.480
You should get to celebrate
the victories, and be

23:49.519 --> 23:53.319
disappointed when you lose
something that matters.

23:53.359 --> 23:54.480
Because it's honest.

23:54.519 --> 23:58.359
And then you can move on.

23:58.400 --> 24:02.440
Realizing that no win can fill
a void, and no loss can hurt

24:02.480 --> 24:05.799
you, unless you let it.

24:05.839 --> 24:05.960
