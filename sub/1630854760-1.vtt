00:05.731 --> 00:08.565
(eerie music)

00:08.584 --> 00:10.158
(muffled shouting)

00:10.236 --> 00:11.418
(hubbub)

00:11.587 --> 00:13.661
- What would you tell your son
if he was still alive?

00:13.739 --> 00:16.306
- What would you tell
your son if he was still alive?

00:17.760 --> 00:19.018
(indistinct chatter)

00:19.094 --> 00:20.561
(camera shutter clicking)

00:26.861 --> 00:28.694
- Murderer!
(gunshots)

00:28.804 --> 00:30.320
(screaming)

00:31.866 --> 00:33.090
- It's just a paintball.

00:33.092 --> 00:34.516
It's just a paintball.

00:34.593 --> 00:35.868
(breathing heavily)

00:36.019 --> 00:38.762
Tell the judge my client needs
15 minutes to clean up.

00:38.781 --> 00:40.097
- Murderer!

00:40.115 --> 00:41.665
(sobbing)

00:48.123 --> 00:50.215
- Now, I was concerned
that the tumour

00:50.367 --> 00:53.260
crossed over to the left side
of your brain.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.222
The good news
is it's an edema:

00:57.299 --> 01:01.301
a swelling of the tissue.
It's not cancer cells.

01:01.378 --> 01:05.397
So we should be able to remove
the tumour with clear margins.

01:05.549 --> 01:06.973
- All of it?

01:07.126 --> 01:09.309
- All of it.
- Thank God.

01:09.461 --> 01:11.812
- You're gonna do great,
Myranda.

01:12.464 --> 01:14.406
You have an amazing daughter.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.283
(phone vibrating)

01:17.727 --> 01:19.995
That's my wife.
Excuse me.

01:20.730 --> 01:21.988
- Thank you, doctor.

01:22.141 --> 01:24.399
- Hey, Lynn,
I'm with a patient, so--

01:24.418 --> 01:26.810
<i> - I'm on my way to see</i>
<i>the principal at Devin's school.</i>

01:26.829 --> 01:29.004
<i> Could you meet me there</i>
<i> as soon as possible?</i>

01:30.240 --> 01:33.241
- Okay. I'll be there
in about 15 minutes.

01:33.577 --> 01:35.969
(soft music)

01:55.783 --> 01:57.116
Where's your mother?

01:57.192 --> 01:58.992
(door closing)

02:05.626 --> 02:07.417
- Thank God you're here.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.279
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.965
I'm the opposite of okay.

02:15.210 --> 02:18.712
It's Sabrina Kavanaugh, the girl
who's been bullying Devin.

02:18.788 --> 02:21.047
- Mrs. Harmon, this isn't
about assigning blame.

02:21.124 --> 02:22.641
- Well, maybe it should be.

02:22.792 --> 02:24.551
I called you about this
two weeks ago.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.480
Have you even asked Devin
about how she and her friends
have been provoking him?

02:28.632 --> 02:30.965
Did you see what they did
to his locker?

02:31.043 --> 02:33.210
- Whatever may have
triggered Devin,

02:33.212 --> 02:35.654
he threatened
another student's life.

02:36.139 --> 02:39.616
This was posted on
three social media platforms.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.002
Sabrina's family hired
a private security firm

02:50.078 --> 02:52.229
that traced it
to Devin's IP address.

02:52.247 --> 02:55.465
- This is...
This is a lot to take in.

02:57.178 --> 03:00.737
I'm not quite sure
how to react to this.

03:01.331 --> 03:03.907
- It would help our assessment
if you can tell us

03:03.926 --> 03:06.501
about any disturbing
behaviour you may--

03:06.578 --> 03:07.761
- Assessment?

03:07.837 --> 03:09.855
I'm sorry,
what kind of assessment?

03:10.599 --> 03:13.934
- This isn't the first time
Devin's behaviour has
raised a flag.

03:13.936 --> 03:17.254
- So you're... expelling him.

03:17.272 --> 03:19.756
Right? I mean, that's
where this is going, isn't it?

03:20.743 --> 03:23.260
- Mrs. Harmon--
- We'll save you the trouble.

03:23.612 --> 03:25.687
- Lynn.
- No. We're gonna pull Devin

03:25.764 --> 03:26.872
out of school.
- Lynn...

03:26.949 --> 03:28.373
We can at least hear them out.

03:28.525 --> 03:30.000
- Are you coming?

03:35.123 --> 03:36.957
That is such great news,
Meghan.

03:37.109 --> 03:38.884
<i> - I'm glad.</i>
- Yeah. No, that school just

03:38.961 --> 03:40.719
wasn't the right fit for him.
<i> - Right.</i>

03:40.796 --> 03:43.055
- And I can't tell you
how much we all appreciate this.

03:43.131 --> 03:44.464
<i> - Well, we're looking forward</i>
<i> to it.</i>

03:44.558 --> 03:46.207
- Okay, great.
We'll see you Wednesday.

03:46.285 --> 03:48.118
<i> - Alright then.</i>
- Thank you.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.620
Well, Bellevista Academy
can take Devin

03:50.714 --> 03:52.105
as a mid-semester transfer.

03:53.717 --> 03:56.193
Hey, Devin, how does that sound?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.739
Dev, did you hear me?

04:01.133 --> 04:02.724
- Yeah. We're in the same car.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.451
It's sort of impossible not to.

04:05.562 --> 04:07.579
- You have an interview
on Wednesday,

04:07.731 --> 04:08.972
but it's just a formality.

04:08.974 --> 04:10.249
- Am I the only one who thinks

04:10.400 --> 04:12.309
we need to talk
about what happened?

04:13.403 --> 04:15.328
What you were thinking
when you threatened that girl?

04:15.481 --> 04:18.298
- What was I thinking?
- Yes!

04:19.960 --> 04:22.094
- I guess I was thinking
she's a stuck-up bitch

04:22.212 --> 04:24.596
who deserves whatever
happens to her.

04:26.249 --> 04:27.340
(banging)
(gasps)

04:27.417 --> 04:28.976
(barking)

04:29.995 --> 04:32.437
- Oh! Oh! I am so sorry,
so sorry.

04:32.514 --> 04:35.515
Okay! Okay! Come on, let's go.
(barking continues)

04:35.667 --> 04:36.775
Bandit, Bandit!

04:36.944 --> 04:41.321
The gate was opened. Oh...
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

04:42.766 --> 04:43.840
- Devin!

04:43.842 --> 04:45.534
Devin!
(car door closing)

04:47.179 --> 04:49.955
- Just give him some space.
Okay?

04:50.833 --> 04:52.624
(car door opening and closing)

04:53.276 --> 04:55.335
<i> Devin, roll the ball</i>
<i> back to Mommy.</i>

04:57.039 --> 04:58.355
<i> Roll the ball to me</i>

04:58.373 --> 05:00.281
<i> and I promise I'll roll it</i>
<i> right back to you.</i>

05:00.301 --> 05:04.544
<i> Roll the ball.</i>
<i>- How come Devin never listens?</i>

05:04.788 --> 05:08.640
<i>- Well, he just, you know, likes</i>
<i> to take his time. That's all.</i>

05:08.792 --> 05:10.958
<i> - Or maybe he's broken.</i>

05:11.036 --> 05:12.960
<i> - Alex, don't say that.</i>

05:13.038 --> 05:15.055
<i> Don't you ever say that again.</i>

05:15.207 --> 05:17.149
<i>Come on, just roll it to Mommy.</i>

05:17.376 --> 05:21.194
<i> Scott, are you filming?</i>
<i> Shut the thing off! Okay?</i>

05:22.898 --> 05:24.489
<i> Is this your pirate ship?</i>

05:24.641 --> 05:25.657
<i> - You can't come in.</i>

05:25.809 --> 05:27.975
- Oh! Is this where
you hide your booty?

05:28.053 --> 05:29.828
- It's where I keep
my prisoners.

05:29.905 --> 05:31.555
- Can I see?

05:31.999 --> 05:34.649
Just one peek. Hey, ow!

05:34.726 --> 05:36.226
<i> Devin, that hurts.</i>

05:36.244 --> 05:37.819
- It's my prisoner.
- Hey!

05:37.896 --> 05:39.153
Let me see. Oh!

05:39.173 --> 05:41.489
Oh, honey, you can't keep
animals like this.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.658
<i> - It can't leave,</i>
<i> it's my prisoner.</i>

05:43.735 --> 05:45.344
- But...

05:46.088 --> 05:47.829
<i> Devin...</i>
(children screaming)

05:47.906 --> 05:50.073
<i> Stop!</i>
(screaming)

05:50.075 --> 05:52.351
<i> Stop! Devin...</i>
(indistinct chatter)

05:55.597 --> 05:57.764
<i> - It can't leave.</i>
<i> It's my prisoner.</i>

05:57.916 --> 05:59.399
<i> - Maybe he's broken.</i>

06:02.863 --> 06:05.271
- Oh. I'm just reading up
on Bellevista.

06:06.108 --> 06:09.534
Student faculty ratio, course
selection... It's incredible.

06:09.686 --> 06:11.595
We should have moved Devin
a year ago.

06:11.613 --> 06:14.748
- Switching schools
isn't gonna fix this, Lynn.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.752
He's getting worse, not better.

06:21.289 --> 06:23.790
- Maybe we could send him back
to Dr. Liu.

06:23.867 --> 06:26.593
You know, he's older now,
he might be more responsive.

06:27.279 --> 06:28.278
- No.

06:28.614 --> 06:30.614
He's already burned
through three psychiatrists

06:30.616 --> 06:33.725
in two years. He's made it
very clear he's not going back.

06:33.877 --> 06:35.285
But it's more than that.

06:35.378 --> 06:38.563
What happened today has been
happening since he was born.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.792
You know how Alex would
always be so upset

06:42.811 --> 06:45.737
if someone was hurt or sad?

06:47.223 --> 06:50.242
Devin's never had
that kind of empathy.

06:50.318 --> 06:51.726
But it's more than that.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.987
- Maybe the problem
is you keep comparing them.

06:54.139 --> 06:56.081
- No.
- No, no. Devin senses that.

06:56.232 --> 06:57.899
You know, the way
you're always measuring him up

06:57.976 --> 06:59.584
against his older brother.
It's not fair.

06:59.736 --> 07:01.962
- I think he's dangerous, Lynn.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.151
- You need to get some sleep.

07:08.153 --> 07:10.411
You've got surgery
in the morning.

07:10.489 --> 07:11.471
- Lynn.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.934
Lynn, I'm worried.
I'm really worried.

07:16.011 --> 07:18.495
- What, you think I'm not?
I'm his mother.

07:18.497 --> 07:20.680
- He spends every day and
every night in that room of his

07:20.757 --> 07:23.275
doing God knows what.
He's got no friends.

07:23.426 --> 07:25.444
I never know what's on his mind.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.261
I don't know what
he's thinking or feeling.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.189
- Maybe you should talk to him.

07:29.341 --> 07:31.766
Okay? Maybe if you spent
a little more time with him

07:31.785 --> 07:33.935
and less with your patients...

07:33.954 --> 07:35.195
- Oh, please, don't make this
about me.

07:35.438 --> 07:37.438
- But every time you decide
to pay attention to him,

07:37.516 --> 07:40.292
you start to catastrophize.
- Every time you make excuses

07:40.443 --> 07:42.109
and point fingers
at everyone else.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.354
- Because I'm the one he comes
to when he's crying

07:44.356 --> 07:47.591
when he's terrified
of these cruel kids!

07:49.636 --> 07:52.304
(muffled arguing)

07:55.383 --> 07:56.558
(sighing)

08:06.895 --> 08:10.071
(panting)
- Judge is ready.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.975
- You okay?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.411
(breathing heavily)

08:17.480 --> 08:20.540
- All rise.
Court is now in session.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.483
- Please.

08:23.245 --> 08:26.079
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.008
This preliminary hearing
is being convened

08:30.159 --> 08:33.086
at the request of the District
Attorney's Office.

08:33.162 --> 08:35.238
From the evidence
presented here today,

08:35.257 --> 08:37.757
I will determine whether or not
to compel the defendant,

08:37.834 --> 08:41.928
Dr. Scott Harmon, to stand trial
in criminal court.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.188
Are both sides ready?

08:43.339 --> 08:44.523
- Ready for the People,
Your Honour.

08:44.599 --> 08:45.915
- Ready for the defense,
Your Honour.

08:46.251 --> 08:48.985
- Prosecution may call
its first witness.

08:50.364 --> 08:54.157
- Just ignore them. Don't give
them the satisfaction.

08:58.947 --> 09:02.332
(dramatic music)

09:16.131 --> 09:18.098
(birds chirping)

09:28.794 --> 09:29.642
(clears throat)

09:29.795 --> 09:31.111
- Oh, hey.

09:32.464 --> 09:33.738
You're up early.

09:36.559 --> 09:39.327
- Technically,
I haven't gone to bed.

09:43.066 --> 09:45.399
Sounded like you and Mom
had a rough night.

09:46.161 --> 09:48.978
- Well, we were just working
through some stuff.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.589
- How'd that go for you?

09:50.665 --> 09:52.966
(coffee machine whirring)

09:54.502 --> 09:56.511
- Your brother's coming home
on Friday.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.750
Maybe the two of you
can get together,

10:02.828 --> 10:04.418
talk about what's been
going on.

10:04.496 --> 10:08.064
- So we can...
work things through?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.443
Like you and Mom.

10:11.519 --> 10:13.320
(barking)

10:18.452 --> 10:19.509
- Bandit!

10:19.527 --> 10:21.936
Come!
- Geez.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.122
Someone should put
that dog down.

10:24.199 --> 10:27.250
(barking continues)
(woman): Bandit, let's go.

10:36.619 --> 10:39.137
- I need a better view, Nadine.
Thank you.

10:39.364 --> 10:41.455
- We're lucky we caught
this thing when we did.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.625
If we had waited for symptoms,
it would've crossed the midline.

10:44.961 --> 10:46.478
- We're getting bleeding
in the field.

10:46.554 --> 10:47.896
Isolate the source.

10:49.057 --> 10:52.299
I think Nadine tore a branch
of the ACA.

10:52.377 --> 10:53.485
- I'll take a look.

10:53.636 --> 10:55.728
- I'm sorry, you asked me
to widen the field--

10:55.805 --> 10:58.490
- Step out of the way
and let Dr. Becker step in

10:58.608 --> 11:00.367
so I can see what I'm doing,
please.

11:03.054 --> 11:04.996
- We're good.

11:07.150 --> 11:08.908
It's all good, it's good.

11:08.985 --> 11:12.078
It's not the ACA,
it's the tumour.

11:12.747 --> 11:15.322
Ah, we're all good, Nadine.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.591
(sighing)

11:20.088 --> 11:22.588
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?

11:22.924 --> 11:24.331
It's the first time in 27 years

11:24.409 --> 11:27.334
I've seen you snap at someone
in the OR.

11:27.913 --> 11:29.688
- I'll speak to her.

11:29.764 --> 11:31.338
- You sure there's nothing else?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.082
Because that didn't
come out of the blue.

11:33.084 --> 11:35.318
- I had a rough night.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.570
- Devin?

11:40.091 --> 11:41.774
What happened this time?

11:41.927 --> 11:44.610
- Honestly,
I'm a little talked out.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.279
I'll speak to Nadine.

11:46.355 --> 11:48.498
- Scott...
- I'm okay.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.937
<i> - Tell me, Dr. Becker...</i>

11:54.697 --> 11:57.257
Do you consider Dr. Harmon
a close friend?

11:58.126 --> 12:00.126
- Yes, he's one of my closest.

12:00.203 --> 12:02.369
- Describe your professional
relationship.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.281
- Dr. Harmon is one of the most
gifted neurosurgeons

12:05.300 --> 12:08.059
I've had the privilege
to work with.

12:08.803 --> 12:11.396
- Did Dr. Harmon

12:11.547 --> 12:14.190
ever mention the prospect
of Devin's death?

12:15.885 --> 12:20.146
- What Dr. Harmon and I shared
was private and speculative.

12:20.298 --> 12:21.965
- It's a simple question.

12:21.983 --> 12:26.152
Did Dr. Harmon ever discuss
the prospect of his son's death?

12:26.896 --> 12:30.373
Let me remind you,
you're under oath.

12:35.497 --> 12:38.256
(music playing)

12:40.761 --> 12:42.969
(phone ringing)

12:46.007 --> 12:48.266
- Hey! Great timing, Al.

12:48.343 --> 12:53.062
<i> - Hey, Dad! I just heard back</i>
<i> from the Fulbright people.</i>

12:53.531 --> 12:54.497
- And?

12:54.941 --> 12:57.091
<i> - I got it.</i>
- The scholarship?

12:57.168 --> 13:00.278
<i> - Don't sound so surprised.</i>
- I'm not, I'm just...

13:00.429 --> 13:02.338
I'm just so proud of you, Alex.

13:02.357 --> 13:05.191
Except I hate the idea of you
living for a year

13:05.343 --> 13:07.360
in a country I can't point out
on a map.

13:07.436 --> 13:09.120
(clanking)
<i> - I'll give you a clue.</i>

13:09.272 --> 13:13.124
<i> It's in Africa, between</i>
<i> Burkina Faso and Mauritania.</i>

13:14.519 --> 13:15.627
<i> Dad?</i>

13:16.112 --> 13:16.777
<i> Dad?</i>

13:16.855 --> 13:18.538
- Oh, say that again?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.857
<i> - How about I just show you</i>
<i> this weekend when I'm home.</i>
<i> Alright?</i>

13:20.859 --> 13:24.043
<i> I'll get in at 3:15, but</i>
<i> you don't have to pick me up.</i>

13:24.137 --> 13:25.695
- Of course I'm gonna
pick you up.

13:25.697 --> 13:27.639
I've gotta run,
a patient wants to speak to me.

13:27.715 --> 13:30.391
I'll see you on Friday.
<i> - Okay. Bye, Dad.</i>

13:42.322 --> 13:44.280
(gunfire)

13:46.234 --> 13:48.551
<i> - So how close</i>
<i> are we on the money?</i>

13:48.570 --> 13:50.161
- I got 3000.

13:51.314 --> 13:52.997
<i> - We're short seven.</i>
(sighing)

13:53.149 --> 13:55.500
- I can do the math, moron,
I'll get the money.

13:55.651 --> 13:57.743
(knocking)

13:58.413 --> 14:01.005
(sighing)
- I gotta go.

14:01.566 --> 14:05.492
- I knocked.
Who were you talking to?

14:05.570 --> 14:06.736
- A friend.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.238
- Your friend have a name?
- Jax.

14:09.498 --> 14:13.167
- Where's Jax from?
- The internet.

14:14.003 --> 14:16.688
- Oh. I heard you two
talking about money.

14:16.764 --> 14:18.598
- Yeah. It's an investment.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.099
- Crypto or...

14:20.585 --> 14:22.509
- Since when do you care
who my friends are

14:22.529 --> 14:23.920
or what I do with them?

14:23.922 --> 14:25.029
- I'm your father,
of course I care.

14:25.106 --> 14:26.422
(scoffs)

14:26.515 --> 14:29.775
Look, if you don't want
to talk to me, that's fine,

14:29.852 --> 14:32.537
but we have to find you
someone you can speak to.

14:32.688 --> 14:33.779
- About what?

14:33.856 --> 14:35.957
- Well, this, for starters.

14:38.527 --> 14:40.044
Was this you?

14:40.529 --> 14:41.954
(laughing)

14:42.031 --> 14:43.873
It's a simple question, Dev.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.609
- What are you
asking me exactly?

14:47.053 --> 14:49.554
If I fed that dog
a wad of ground beef

14:49.705 --> 14:52.307
laced with rat poison
before I bashed its skull in
with a hammer?

14:52.726 --> 14:54.117
- Did you?

14:54.469 --> 14:57.604
- If I did, you should be
thanking me for the peace
and quiet.

14:58.306 --> 14:59.789
No more yap, yap, yap.

14:59.807 --> 15:02.567
- We're not done here. Hey!

15:36.678 --> 15:38.353
(sighing)

16:18.886 --> 16:21.145
(door opening)
- Devin just ran out
of the house.

16:21.297 --> 16:24.390
He said you accused him
of killing the neighbour's dog.

16:24.467 --> 16:28.802
My God, Scott, he's not the one
who needs help here. You are!

16:28.822 --> 16:30.613
- Read this.

16:39.891 --> 16:41.315
- This is uh...

16:41.392 --> 16:44.560
the girl from Devin's school,
Sabrina Kavanaugh.

16:44.579 --> 16:46.129
- Yeah.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.829
<i> (Devin): No one listens</i>
<i> to anyone.</i>

16:56.999 --> 17:01.077
<i>They just want to hear their own</i>
<i> stupid copycat voices</i>

17:01.079 --> 17:06.065
<i> copying each other</i>
<i> on an endless loop, 24-7.</i>

17:07.676 --> 17:10.194
<i> I'm special because I know</i>
<i> who I am</i>

17:10.697 --> 17:12.513
<i> and I know what I want.</i>

17:12.532 --> 17:15.424
<i> Not like all the Stacys</i>
<i> and the Chads</i>

17:15.443 --> 17:17.518
<i> who walk around like insects,</i>

17:18.429 --> 17:21.539
<i> clueless that my boot</i>
<i> is right over their heads</i>

17:22.100 --> 17:24.825
<i> ready to come down whenever</i>
<i> I choose.</i>

17:26.195 --> 17:30.256
<i> I remember everyone</i>
<i> who's ever tried to hurt me.</i>

17:31.109 --> 17:32.800
<i> Especially you, Sabrina.</i>

17:34.112 --> 17:37.113
<i> You think I didn't see you</i>
<i> laughing at me?</i>

17:38.207 --> 17:40.558
<i> Well, let's see if</i>
<i>you're laughing when I wipe you</i>

17:40.709 --> 17:44.270
<i> and your bitches' coven</i>
<i> off the face of planet Earth.</i>

17:45.548 --> 17:47.214
<i> Because Zero Hour</i>
<i> is almost here.</i>

17:47.233 --> 17:49.975
<i> And I will take the respect</i>
<i> I deserve.</i>

17:50.052 --> 17:51.460
(honking)

17:51.479 --> 17:52.487
(tires screeching)

17:54.132 --> 17:55.815
(stuttering)

17:55.967 --> 17:58.159
- I can't stop shaking
right now.

17:58.727 --> 18:00.453
- It's okay.

18:00.530 --> 18:01.971
It's okay. I'm here.

18:02.323 --> 18:05.232
It's okay.
- Oh God.

18:05.977 --> 18:08.811
Scott, I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.296
- I'm so sorry.
- Shh.

18:10.832 --> 18:13.508
(crying)

18:26.088 --> 18:29.089
(chuckling)
Well, that's a new one.

18:30.001 --> 18:32.335
Drinking while dialyzing.
(laughing)

18:32.337 --> 18:34.337
Or is it dialyzing
while drinking?

18:34.430 --> 18:37.506
Either way, I doubt
your nephrologist would approve.

18:37.508 --> 18:42.511
- I've got stage four renal
failure, so I ask myself:

18:42.513 --> 18:44.363
What the hell do I have
to lose?

18:44.440 --> 18:45.772
(chuckling)

18:45.792 --> 18:47.183
If I'd known you were coming,

18:47.201 --> 18:49.276
I'd have brought another glass.

18:49.537 --> 18:53.464
- I just wanted to let you know
that Nadine accepted my apology,

18:53.616 --> 18:54.690
so we're all good.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.634
- Oh. I have a funny feeling

18:56.785 --> 18:59.695
you didn't come here
just to talk about Nadine.

18:59.714 --> 19:01.197
- I don't want to burden you.

19:01.199 --> 19:04.291
- I assume we're talking
about Devin.

19:04.627 --> 19:06.519
(sighing)

19:12.134 --> 19:13.609
(sighing)

19:15.062 --> 19:18.823
- He's getting ready, Mitch.
To do something bad.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.159
- What do you mean,
"something bad"?

19:21.310 --> 19:26.722
- I found a journal that
he keeps hidden in his room.

19:27.167 --> 19:31.752
Before I put it back,
I took these.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.024
I don't know what to do.

19:37.026 --> 19:39.084
I can't tell him
that I searched his room,

19:39.237 --> 19:42.087
it'll destroy what little trust
we have between us.

19:42.164 --> 19:43.923
And he refuses to see
a therapist.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
- Where's Lynn in all this?

19:46.019 --> 19:48.244
- We're on the same page.
Finally.

19:48.262 --> 19:51.689
Not that either of us
have a clue how to handle this.

19:51.766 --> 19:53.265
- What about the police?

19:53.418 --> 19:56.176
This is enough to get
an involuntary hold.

19:56.270 --> 19:57.528
- 72 hours max.

19:57.922 --> 20:01.774
And that's only if Devin submits
to a psychological evaluation,

20:01.926 --> 20:03.701
which he will not do.

20:04.186 --> 20:06.037
- Look, there's gotta be
something they can do.

20:06.113 --> 20:07.205
- Like what?

20:07.598 --> 20:11.167
They can't arrest him
for a crime he hasn't committed.

20:13.746 --> 20:17.273
The idea of Devin hurting
himself is horrifying enough.

20:17.275 --> 20:20.384
But what if he hurts
someone else?

20:20.536 --> 20:22.511
What if he does
what I'm afraid of?

20:23.872 --> 20:25.130
What...

20:25.283 --> 20:29.060
My gut tells me that
he will do.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.103
Sometimes...

20:31.973 --> 20:34.623
And this is gonna sound awful...

20:34.642 --> 20:36.359
Sometimes...

20:39.630 --> 20:42.815
I imagine that I get this
phone call

20:43.559 --> 20:46.327
that Devin's been killed
in a car accident.

20:47.747 --> 20:53.042
And I keep waiting for
this primal grief to hit me.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.996
But instead,

20:57.072 --> 21:00.967
I just have this
overwhelming relief.

21:04.489 --> 21:06.155
- Dr. Becker,
as neurosurgeons,

21:06.157 --> 21:08.432
you're used to making
hard decisions.

21:08.584 --> 21:11.677
Choosing the lesser
of two bad choices.

21:11.829 --> 21:13.679
- This is true.

21:13.831 --> 21:15.498
- Can you give me an example?

21:15.500 --> 21:19.018
- To remove a tumour, we have
to take into consideration

21:19.170 --> 21:22.521
the patient's life being
compromised

21:22.673 --> 21:26.099
by paralysis or some other
cognitive deficit.

21:26.677 --> 21:28.694
- Over the years
you've known each other,

21:28.771 --> 21:32.014
has Dr. Harmon shared
Devin's problems with you?

21:32.016 --> 21:33.516
- He's my friend.

21:33.534 --> 21:37.536
- Did Dr. Harmon share his fear
that Devin was planning

21:37.688 --> 21:39.130
to commit mass murder?

21:39.206 --> 21:42.967
- No. Not explicitly.
- But essentially.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.696
- Yes.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.032
- Did he also share
what happened when

21:50.034 --> 21:52.143
he took his concerns
to the police?

21:52.979 --> 21:56.147
- He was frustrated that they
wouldn't do anything about it.

21:56.298 --> 21:59.375
- So Dr. Harmon was...

21:59.393 --> 22:01.968
convinced that he needed
to do something himself.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.530
Before Devin
could execute his plan.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.160
Earlier, you described
the "cold calculus"

22:09.311 --> 22:12.754
of your profession,
of having to make the lesser
of two bad choices,

22:12.756 --> 22:14.056
so let me ask you...

22:14.058 --> 22:15.833
Did Dr. Harmon ever
share the cold calculus

22:15.984 --> 22:19.003
of killing his own son before
his son could kill anyone else?

22:20.748 --> 22:23.090
(suspenseful music)

22:25.236 --> 22:26.402
Specifically,

22:26.420 --> 22:29.663
did Dr. Harmon share his plan
to take his son

22:29.682 --> 22:32.016
to Deep Gorge to murder him?

22:32.593 --> 22:35.269
(dramatic music)

22:43.754 --> 22:45.488
(door opening)

22:46.607 --> 22:48.324
(door closing)

22:50.428 --> 22:51.518
- Hey, Dev.

22:51.596 --> 22:52.928
Been waiting for you.

22:52.930 --> 22:54.205
Where have you been?

22:54.356 --> 22:55.873
- Looking for stray dogs.

22:55.950 --> 22:57.099
- I'm sorry, Devin.

22:57.435 --> 23:00.211
That was an awful thing
for me to say and I'm sorry.

23:00.863 --> 23:02.955
- Whatever.
- Listen...

23:03.365 --> 23:06.199
I've been waiting here
to talk to you for an hour

23:06.219 --> 23:08.469
before your mother comes home,
just us.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.890
- What, do you wanna talk
heart to heart?

23:12.967 --> 23:15.300
Man to man?
Father to son?

23:15.453 --> 23:18.729
- Just give me a minute
of your attention. That's all.

23:18.806 --> 23:20.398
Just one minute.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.025
Look...

23:24.462 --> 23:27.813
Whatever trouble you've had over
the years...

23:28.299 --> 23:30.466
I haven't helped.

23:31.135 --> 23:33.577
We can't start over,
I get that.

23:34.247 --> 23:39.208
But maybe we can try to deal
with each other differently.

23:40.311 --> 23:42.995
I was hoping that maybe
we could start

23:43.071 --> 23:45.664
by spending more time
alone together.

23:46.317 --> 23:51.912
You know, not with a therapist
in a therapist's office, or...

23:52.414 --> 23:55.141
Somewhere away from here.

23:56.010 --> 23:57.584
Do you remember the State Park

23:57.603 --> 24:00.771
that I once took you and Alex
camping in?

24:00.923 --> 24:04.483
We went hiking up to Deep Gorge.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.353
Do you remember that?

24:08.506 --> 24:09.613
- No.

24:10.098 --> 24:12.616
- Well, it's a beautiful place.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.161
I think you'd really like it.

24:19.850 --> 24:21.125
- That's pretty challenging,

24:21.202 --> 24:23.519
especially considering
the weather this time of year.

24:23.537 --> 24:26.297
- We have all this winter gear
that we've barely used.

24:27.115 --> 24:30.042
- I still can't believe Devin
actually agreed to go with you.

24:30.194 --> 24:32.953
- Well, he didn't exactly
jump up and down.

24:33.030 --> 24:35.121
- Yeah, but he said yes.

24:35.141 --> 24:39.201
- Well, I gave him an incentive.

24:39.220 --> 24:42.054
Before we had our blowout,
I overheard him

24:42.148 --> 24:45.131
talking to one of his friends
about this investment

24:45.151 --> 24:48.043
that they need some money for.
- So you bribed him.

24:48.045 --> 24:49.728
Not that that matters.

24:49.822 --> 24:53.199
The fact that you got through
to him at all, Scott...

24:56.662 --> 24:58.162
Thank you.

24:58.647 --> 25:01.081
For not giving up on him.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.297
Be careful out there.

25:11.344 --> 25:14.094
(soft music)

25:21.912 --> 25:24.188
(eerie music)

25:30.696 --> 25:33.489
(birdsong)

25:34.200 --> 25:36.091
- It's getting cold.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.202
I'm freezing.

25:40.447 --> 25:41.521
How much longer?

25:42.266 --> 25:44.875
- We're still a couple of hours
away from the Gorge.

25:45.861 --> 25:48.879
I remember the last time
we were here, I promised you

25:48.956 --> 25:51.957
if you got tired I'd carry you
the rest of the way.

25:52.443 --> 25:55.627
I guess the expiration date
on that promise has passed, eh?

25:55.704 --> 26:00.266
- Can't we just camp here
and hike the rest of the way
in the morning?

26:05.122 --> 26:08.023
- Yeah, there's a spot
we can camp up ahead.

26:20.487 --> 26:22.329
(grunts)

26:25.643 --> 26:27.459
(bird squawking)

26:34.594 --> 26:38.053
(suspenseful music)

26:41.767 --> 26:43.726
(grunting)

26:44.770 --> 26:47.313
(breathing heavily)

26:48.757 --> 26:50.482
- Try this.

26:54.429 --> 26:56.071
- Thanks.

26:57.341 --> 27:01.160
(clanking)
(grunting)

27:09.462 --> 27:11.462
(crickets chirping)

27:12.948 --> 27:14.781
We should get some sleep.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.358
- What about the money?

27:16.377 --> 27:20.362
The investment with my friend?
You said we could go over it.

27:20.381 --> 27:23.548
- It's getting late,
we can talk about it tomorrow.

27:23.701 --> 27:25.717
- It's like, not even nine.

27:25.870 --> 27:28.095
- We've had a long day.

27:28.555 --> 27:30.439
(fire crackling)

27:32.559 --> 27:35.402
- Why are you trying
to force me to sleep?

27:38.549 --> 27:40.074
You go to sleep.

27:44.646 --> 27:46.246
Whatever.

27:49.743 --> 27:51.460
(zipper opening)

27:57.902 --> 28:00.260
(birds chirping)

28:12.599 --> 28:14.024
(moaning)

28:14.585 --> 28:16.193
Is it time?

28:17.512 --> 28:20.355
- Yeah. It's time.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.491
(groaning)

28:24.094 --> 28:27.496
- I... I just
realized something.

28:28.708 --> 28:29.932
- What?

28:29.934 --> 28:32.292
- Alex was supposed
to come home today.

28:33.771 --> 28:36.104
- I told him to come
next week.

28:36.549 --> 28:39.591
Right now,
you're the priority.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.482
(birds squawking)

29:00.831 --> 29:02.489
(phone vibrating)

29:06.579 --> 29:07.970
- Emergency?

29:07.972 --> 29:10.164
- Nothing that can't wait.

29:20.167 --> 29:22.259
(eerie music)

29:26.991 --> 29:29.308
- Now I remember this place.

29:34.756 --> 29:39.359
I remember wondering
what it would be like to push
Alex over the side.

29:47.177 --> 29:51.288
(eerie music)

29:52.683 --> 29:54.500
(wind blowing)

30:05.696 --> 30:07.471
(suspenseful music)

30:30.770 --> 30:32.387
- What are you doing?

30:32.981 --> 30:35.082
- Shouldn't I be
the one asking you?

30:36.727 --> 30:38.293
- Devin...

30:40.731 --> 30:43.131
- I know you found my book.

30:44.659 --> 30:46.051
You read what I wrote.

30:48.422 --> 30:51.223
Did you ever think that maybe
I wanted you to read it?

30:51.684 --> 30:52.850
- Why?

30:52.926 --> 30:55.302
- So you'd know how angry I was.

30:55.337 --> 30:56.478
(gasps)

30:57.431 --> 30:59.339
How angry I am.

31:00.508 --> 31:02.267
And don't say I should have
talked to you about it,

31:02.419 --> 31:05.070
because that's never worked
for either of us, has it?

31:07.774 --> 31:10.075
- What should we do?

31:17.434 --> 31:21.420
- All I know is that I don't
want to feel like this anymore.

31:28.629 --> 31:30.053
(sighing)

31:32.633 --> 31:35.183
(soft music)

31:45.629 --> 31:47.070
(sighing)

31:56.231 --> 31:58.990
Look, there is no investment.
I just...

31:59.067 --> 32:01.234
made that up because I...

32:01.253 --> 32:04.129
knew you wouldn't understand
the real reason.

32:04.739 --> 32:06.572
- Try me.

32:07.167 --> 32:09.760
- That stupid school
that Mom wants me to go to,

32:09.911 --> 32:13.321
I can't go there. I can't.

32:14.174 --> 32:17.917
- I was talking to my friend Jax
about the situation and he...

32:18.771 --> 32:22.255
He said I could go with him on
this trip that he's got planned.

32:22.666 --> 32:25.484
- What trip?
- Iceland.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.927
For two months.

32:28.263 --> 32:31.114
He's got the whole thing
figured out.

32:31.266 --> 32:34.242
Where we'll go,
how much it'll cost.

32:34.936 --> 32:36.695
It's all right here.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.348
That's why I wanted to talk
to you about it yesterday.

32:40.367 --> 32:44.544
I was thinking that
maybe if I go with him,

32:45.631 --> 32:47.355
when I come back,

32:47.357 --> 32:51.710
I could see somebody.
That's what the money's for.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.597
A way to maybe stop feeling
so mad all the time.

33:18.813 --> 33:21.415
- Hey! Welcome home!

33:24.728 --> 33:26.486
Uh... So, how was it?

33:26.505 --> 33:29.080
- It was good.
It was really good.

33:29.233 --> 33:31.675
- Oh.
- Should I help you unpack?

33:31.826 --> 33:33.418
- No, you go inside.

33:34.013 --> 33:36.755
You're tired.
- I'm okay.

33:37.591 --> 33:39.924
- The ground was hard,
it was cold,

33:40.077 --> 33:42.227
you need some real sleep.
Go on.

33:42.929 --> 33:45.063
- You sure?
- Yeah.

33:45.932 --> 33:47.983
- Thanks, Dad.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.440
Goodnight, Mom.
- Oh yeah.

33:55.592 --> 33:57.159
Goodnight.

34:01.189 --> 34:03.431
Is that our son?

34:03.433 --> 34:04.949
- I know, right?

34:05.026 --> 34:06.626
(chuckling)
- Oh...

34:07.529 --> 34:08.712
- What? What's wrong?

34:08.863 --> 34:11.048
- I tried calling to tell you.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.384
(sighing)
Our neighbour found her dog.

34:16.704 --> 34:18.446
Devin didn't do anything.

34:18.465 --> 34:22.542
And it kills me to think
that we let ourselves believe
that he did.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.561
You know?

34:29.793 --> 34:32.027
(soft music)

34:32.738 --> 34:34.529
Okay, tell me everything.

34:35.799 --> 34:38.742
- Well, we got to talking.

34:39.152 --> 34:43.246
He's... he's open
to getting help.

34:43.731 --> 34:46.249
- Oh, that's incredible.

34:46.326 --> 34:47.992
Go back, I need details.

34:48.829 --> 34:52.756
- Let me unpack first and
I'll tell you everything inside.

35:07.831 --> 35:10.232
(crying)

35:21.695 --> 35:24.621
- No reasonable person
can deny that Dr. Harmon's

35:24.698 --> 35:26.348
was a difficult situation.

35:26.850 --> 35:28.533
An impossible situation.

35:29.202 --> 35:33.279
But we're not here today to
second-guess what he didn't do,
or should have done.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.966
We're here because
of what he actually did.

35:37.302 --> 35:40.095
So I'd like to call
my next witness to the stand.

35:47.204 --> 35:49.396
Please state your name
for the court.

35:51.041 --> 35:53.041
<i> - Jasper Sind.</i>

35:53.043 --> 35:54.985
- Is that what Devin called you?

35:55.061 --> 35:58.563
- No. He knew me
by my gaming handle.

35:58.715 --> 35:59.281
Jax.

36:03.053 --> 36:04.977
- Sir?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.555
- Hey. I've been
looking for you.

36:07.574 --> 36:10.575
Myranda Chang is coming in
at noon for a follow-up CT,

36:10.652 --> 36:12.335
I figured you'd want
to debrief the parents.

36:12.487 --> 36:16.122
- Sure. When it's good news,
it's good to be the messenger.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.825
- You know,
I barely saw you this week.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.328
You're not avoiding me, are you?

36:23.015 --> 36:26.424
- Actually,
everything's good.

36:26.576 --> 36:27.909
- Really?

36:27.928 --> 36:29.577
- Things are okay.

36:29.596 --> 36:30.729
- Hey, I'm glad.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.355
- Come on,
I'll tell you about...

36:32.432 --> 36:35.025
- Let me grab a coffee,
I'll be right over.

36:37.754 --> 36:39.196
(sighing)

36:40.424 --> 36:42.774
- We just want him
to care about something,

36:42.926 --> 36:45.202
do something productive.

36:45.929 --> 36:47.704
- Who's this friend?

36:48.281 --> 36:51.541
- He met him through
his online video gaming.

36:51.693 --> 36:52.876
- Oh...

36:53.027 --> 36:54.544
- Baby steps, right?

36:54.771 --> 36:57.047
Before last week,
I didn't know he had a friend.

36:57.941 --> 37:01.200
It's not like I just wrote him
a blank cheque and that's that.

37:01.220 --> 37:04.221
I mean, he promised to see
a therapist when he gets back.

37:04.556 --> 37:10.452
He's interviewing a bunch
of them before he... leaves.

37:10.878 --> 37:13.045
<i>(television): We do have reports</i>
<i> that the shooter</i>

37:13.065 --> 37:15.957
<i> has barricaded himself inside</i>
<i> one of the classrooms.</i>

37:15.959 --> 37:18.126
<i> This is a live situation.</i>

37:18.144 --> 37:20.962
<i> We will keep bringing you</i>
<i> updates as they come in.</i>

37:20.964 --> 37:23.156
(breathing heavily)

37:23.909 --> 37:25.742
(sirens wailing)

37:26.394 --> 37:29.137
- Parent or guardian,
park over there and check in.

37:29.155 --> 37:31.063
Otherwise,
you need to turn around.
- I'm Scott Harmon.

37:31.141 --> 37:33.333
- Park here and come with me.

37:35.812 --> 37:38.129
(suspenseful music)

37:40.150 --> 37:42.408
(helicopter whirring)

37:42.761 --> 37:44.135
(siren wailing)

37:56.883 --> 37:58.775
(muffled screaming)

37:58.926 --> 38:00.527
This way, sir.

38:03.097 --> 38:05.507
- Dr. Harmon,
this is Captain Kramer,

38:05.509 --> 38:07.951
the chief hostage negotiator.

38:08.102 --> 38:09.769
- Your son's barricaded
himself in a classroom

38:09.846 --> 38:11.454
with eight hostages.

38:11.531 --> 38:12.847
He wants to talk to you.

38:12.849 --> 38:16.167
Just listen
and let him talk.

38:19.447 --> 38:20.588
<i> - Devin.</i>

38:21.708 --> 38:23.449
(crying)

38:23.468 --> 38:24.509
- Hey, Dad.

38:25.953 --> 38:27.453
- Devin, let them go.

38:28.048 --> 38:30.381
(sighing)
- You're not my father anymore.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.393
<i> Not that you ever were.</i>

38:35.463 --> 38:38.481
You really believed that
I bought into all that crap

38:38.558 --> 38:39.983
up at Deep Gorge?

38:40.760 --> 38:43.528
<i> About wanting to help me</i>
<i> through my anger?</i>

38:46.825 --> 38:48.550
(whimpering)

38:48.568 --> 38:50.994
You brought me up there
to kill me.

38:52.072 --> 38:53.813
<i> And don't deny it,</i>

38:53.832 --> 38:56.157
<i> we both know that it's true.</i>

38:57.243 --> 39:00.503
The one thing that I don't
understand is...

39:01.155 --> 39:03.506
why you didn't go
through with it.

39:05.660 --> 39:07.218
- You're my son.

39:09.664 --> 39:13.141
- I guess you should've
done it when you had
the chance because...

39:14.244 --> 39:16.394
I couldn't have done it
without you.

39:18.673 --> 39:20.398
(gunshots)

39:24.363 --> 39:28.698
- If Dr. Harmon hadn't given
Devin $10,000,

39:28.925 --> 39:31.534
would you and he have been able
to carry out the shooting?

39:31.686 --> 39:33.203
- Not a chance.

39:33.354 --> 39:36.114
- Tell us what you bought with
the money Dr. Harmon sent you.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.266
- Two AR-15s.

39:38.284 --> 39:40.768
Three M&P 9 mm 2.0.

39:40.862 --> 39:42.620
Two Kevlar vests.

39:42.697 --> 39:45.273
Smoke bombs, 5-inch fixed
blade hunting knife.

39:45.291 --> 39:49.552
Ten boxes of the 5.56 mil
spec cartridges.

39:50.872 --> 39:55.207
- Did Dr. Harmon ever contact
you before he sent the money?

39:55.227 --> 39:56.393
- Never.

39:56.711 --> 39:58.953
- Why do you suppose he'd let
his son go to Iceland

39:58.955 --> 40:00.546
with someone he'd never
even spoken to?

40:01.307 --> 40:04.125
(chuckling)
- Yeah, see, that's...

40:04.127 --> 40:06.144
that's the thing. Devin...

40:07.464 --> 40:11.891
Devin never thought
that his father actually
believed his story.

40:11.985 --> 40:14.560
He told me that
his father hated him

40:14.638 --> 40:18.473
and that he'd pay pretty much
anything to make him disappear.

40:18.475 --> 40:20.500
(gasps)

40:22.829 --> 40:25.422
- That's all, Mr. Sind.
Thank you.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.653
Your Honour,

40:31.655 --> 40:35.247
Scott Harmon knew his son
was planning to commit
mass murder.

40:35.341 --> 40:37.434
He had read all about it.

40:38.011 --> 40:41.420
Did Dr. Harmon stop his son?
Get him help?

40:41.498 --> 40:42.830
Intervene? No.

40:42.832 --> 40:44.274
He wrote a cheque.

40:44.834 --> 40:49.779
Essentially arming his
son with the weapons he used
to murder seven students,

40:49.931 --> 40:51.597
grievously wound a dozen others

40:51.616 --> 40:54.617
and permanently traumatize
an entire community.

40:54.769 --> 40:56.769
Other peoples' children
are dead

40:56.863 --> 40:59.197
because of Scott Harmon's
complicity.

41:00.107 --> 41:02.792
Now, Dr. Harmon may claim
wishful thinking.

41:02.944 --> 41:04.109
He may claim denial.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.445
But he knew what
his son was planning.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.948
He was certain enough to plan
killing Devin himself.

41:09.542 --> 41:12.860
But when he lost his nerve
and couldn't go through with it,

41:13.363 --> 41:15.379
Dr. Harmon paid off his son,

41:15.532 --> 41:18.457
knowing full well what
he would do with that money.

41:19.703 --> 41:23.062
If that isn't complicity,
I don't know what is.

41:26.559 --> 41:29.569
(crying)

41:32.732 --> 41:35.733
- The District Attorney has made
a compelling argument.

41:35.810 --> 41:37.309
In the end, however,

41:37.329 --> 41:40.071
her interpretation
of the law is an overreach.

41:40.223 --> 41:43.482
Rather than simply having some
speculative knowledge,

41:43.560 --> 41:46.169
the defendant needs to have
taken a more direct role,

41:46.320 --> 41:48.821
either by encouraging
or planning

41:48.898 --> 41:52.400
or in some way assisting
the crime with specific intent.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.920
Dr. Harmon's behaviour
may have been negligent,

41:55.997 --> 41:57.755
but it wasn't criminal.

41:57.907 --> 42:00.758
Prosecution's argument
doesn't rise to legal standard

42:00.910 --> 42:03.928
of his having been accessory
to a felony before the fact.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.006
The defendant, therefore, is
remanded into his own custody.

42:07.083 --> 42:08.399
(gavel banging)

42:09.528 --> 42:11.435
- Congratulations, Scott.

42:12.088 --> 42:14.531
(indistinct chatter)
