WEBVTT

00:24.198 --> 00:25.503
Where's it coming from?

00:25.634 --> 00:27.157
Over there.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.562
Blocked.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.216
Uh, h-hello?

00:43.260 --> 00:44.827
That's a Balenciaga.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.046
It's, like, five grand.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.308
What do you know about purses?

00:47.438 --> 00:49.919
It's a satchel.
And don't be sexist.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.052
Who would leave
a designer bag out here?

00:57.144 --> 00:58.971
I'm guessing her.

01:34.790 --> 01:38.054
Oh, come on, man.
Laser tag's supposed to be fun.

01:38.185 --> 01:41.101
When your gun doesn't
shoot, it's not fun.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.886
Well, I had fun watching you
get your tail handed to you

01:44.016 --> 01:45.322
by a bunch of tiny children.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.716
- Oh, okay.
- You got your tail
handed to you

01:47.846 --> 01:49.109
by a bunch of tiny children?

01:49.239 --> 01:50.980
No.
Yeah.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.895
I so want to hear this story.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.636
Jimmy's daughter Victoria

01:54.766 --> 01:57.465
had a big laser tag
birthday party this weekend.

01:57.595 --> 02:00.772
She invited Uncle Nick to, uh,
teach the girls how to shoot.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.122
That's sweet.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.340
Well, there was
nothing sweet about them.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.950
They were like
miniature warriors.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.518
They lit up Uncle Nick's vest
like a Christmas tree.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.129
Oh, wow, that's...

02:09.259 --> 02:10.434
that's unfortunate.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.480
They didn't have a mercy rule?

02:12.610 --> 02:14.656
No, there was no mercy
in these little girls' hearts.

02:14.786 --> 02:17.006
What's the deal, guys? I've been
waiting in the parking lot.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.138
Why?

02:18.268 --> 02:19.922
Check your Bandium app.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.663
I sent a group alert.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.710
I did not get an alert.

02:25.841 --> 02:26.885
Yeah, me neither.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.148
You sent this today?

02:28.278 --> 02:30.411
Yeah. Yeah, just
a few minutes ago...

02:31.368 --> 02:32.152
Oops.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.545
Forgot to press send.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.765
That's, uh,
that's a rookie move.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.031
It's not coming through.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.033
There's, like,
a 15-second delay.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.861
Or you could just tell us.

02:47.384 --> 02:50.561
Dead body,
Naval Station Norfolk.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.128
Okay, grabbing our gear.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.047
Got a dead body,
Naval Station Norfolk.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.702
Man, this
app is awesome.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.446
Gunshot wound to the head,
small caliber,

03:05.576 --> 03:06.925
no exit wound.

03:07.056 --> 03:09.363
Got a time of death?

03:09.493 --> 03:11.365
Well, based on body temperature
and lividity,

03:11.495 --> 03:14.542
I would say, uh, 12 hours ago.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.543
I.D.?

03:15.673 --> 03:16.848
Sandra Holdren, 64,

03:16.979 --> 03:18.850
civilian from Bethesda.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.200
According to the trusty Google,

03:20.330 --> 03:22.680
she used to be
a hotshot financial advisor.

03:22.811 --> 03:23.855
Which explains

03:23.986 --> 03:25.161
that big rock on her finger.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.119
And the Balenciaga bag.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.731
Jimmy, I'm impressed.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.211
Fashion is art.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.386
Expensive art.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.778
And whoever killed Ms. Holdren

03:33.909 --> 03:35.432
wasn't interested in taking it.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.000
So, the Tesla's registered
to our victim.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.567
McGee's dusting it for prints.

03:39.697 --> 03:42.004
And, uh, I found
these binoculars

03:42.134 --> 03:43.223
in the bushes.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.181
Those are opera glasses.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.227
I don't think she was
watching an opera.

03:47.357 --> 03:50.578
No, but she must have been
watching something.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.972
Mm, seems like an odd
place to throw down a lawn chair

03:54.103 --> 03:56.236
and take in the sights.

03:56.366 --> 03:57.672
Excuse me. Petty Officer?

03:57.802 --> 04:00.240
- Yes, sir?
- Who plays on that soccer field?

04:00.370 --> 04:02.807
It's a shared field.
Different leagues every day.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.419
- You know who played last night?
- Uh, Sundays

04:05.549 --> 04:07.290
are always reserved
for the youth league teams.

04:07.421 --> 04:09.423
Why would she be watching
from out here?

04:09.553 --> 04:11.555
It's not exactly, uh,
front-row seats.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.645
Maybe she didn't have
authorization to enter the base?

04:14.776 --> 04:16.560
One of the M.A.s noticed that,
um, someone

04:16.691 --> 04:19.128
was sitting here, watching
the game a few weeks ago.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.043
He thinks
it might have been her.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.653
So, a hotshot financial advisor

04:22.784 --> 04:24.612
with a-- what's the name
of that bag, Jimmy?

04:24.742 --> 04:25.787
Balenciaga.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.179
Thank you-- bag on her arm

04:27.310 --> 04:29.921
is peeking through a fence,

04:30.052 --> 04:31.662
watching a kids' soccer game. Why?

04:31.793 --> 04:35.275
And how did nobody
hear the gunshot?

04:35.405 --> 04:37.929
Because the killer
used a silencer.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.192
See the burn marks around
the entry wound there?

04:40.323 --> 04:41.890
A telltale sign.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.849
This was an execution.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.331
My buddy at the phone company
was able to trace

04:48.462 --> 04:50.159
the blocked calls to her cell.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.465
Who?

04:52.466 --> 04:55.207
The calls were coming
from her own house.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.081
This place is incredible.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.126
If by "incredible,"
you mean creepy,

05:01.257 --> 05:04.826
then, yeah, this
place is incredible.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.828
Don't touch the gargoyle.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.308
Why?

05:08.438 --> 05:10.310
Gargoyles weird me out.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.921
I know it's
irrational, just...

05:13.051 --> 05:15.271
just bear with me here.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.842
For me, it's grasshoppers.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.760
NCIS.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.676
It's Sandra, isn't it?

05:33.550 --> 05:35.422
So, you're Sandra's valet?

05:35.552 --> 05:38.338
Yeah, valet, personal assistant,
house manager.

05:38.468 --> 05:41.210
I knew something was wrong when
I couldn't get a hold of her.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.255
I was calling hospitals,

05:43.386 --> 05:45.736
worried she was
in an accident, but...

05:46.781 --> 05:48.348
...murdered?

05:49.174 --> 05:52.352
We really need to notify
her next of kin.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.658
Did Sandra have any family?

05:54.789 --> 05:57.313
Her husband died
a long time ago.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.490
She has an adult daughter Ruby,

06:00.621 --> 06:04.364
but they haven't
spoken in years.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.235
They had a big falling out.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.629
- About?
- I honestly
don't know.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.892
Sandra doesn't talk about it.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.373
I understand.

06:14.461 --> 06:17.072
We think that Sandra was
watching a youth soccer game

06:17.202 --> 06:18.378
when she was killed.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.727
Ruby have any kids?

06:19.857 --> 06:21.816
She has a son
who's about nine or ten,

06:21.946 --> 06:24.688
but I don't think Sandra's been
to any of his games.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.474
She knew Ruby
didn't want her there.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.476
Do you think Ruby
could have anything to do

06:29.606 --> 06:30.999
with Sandra's murder?

06:31.129 --> 06:33.349
Despite everything,
I don't think she's capable

06:33.480 --> 06:35.525
of hurting her own mom.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.746
Sandra have any enemies
we should know about?

06:38.876 --> 06:41.052
Not that I know of.

06:41.183 --> 06:44.316
Sandra was an amazing woman.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.929
Kind, funny.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.671
Would you like to meet her?

06:51.672 --> 06:52.673
Um...

06:53.848 --> 06:55.589
you mean,
meet the woman who just died?

06:56.633 --> 06:58.635
Um...

06:59.767 --> 07:01.290
Yes.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.118
Yeah, so I'm allergic

07:03.248 --> 07:04.162
to home movies.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.426
We're not watching home movies.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.949
Then what are we doing?

07:08.079 --> 07:11.779
I could tell you, but
it's easier if I show you.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.874
Hi, Sandra.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.093
Hi.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.965
I'm so glad
you're here.

07:24.095 --> 07:27.795
Take a seat and let's talk.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.502
It's good to see you, Sandra.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.461
It's nice to be seen.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.463
Okay, hold on.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.465
Time-out. What
the hell is this?

07:45.595 --> 07:46.988
It's an interactive hologram.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.685
I'm gonna need you
to use more words.

07:48.816 --> 07:51.688
I don't know how it works.
I just know it works.

07:51.819 --> 07:52.994
Hey, don't touch it.
You're gonna break it,

07:53.124 --> 07:54.648
and I don't even know
what it is.

07:59.522 --> 08:00.958
She looks so real.

08:01.089 --> 08:03.308
Last month, a tech company
came in and interviewed her

08:03.439 --> 08:04.571
for, like, two weeks straight.

08:04.701 --> 08:07.051
Asking her
about her life

08:07.182 --> 08:09.010
and then they created, uh,

08:09.140 --> 08:11.273
- this whole thing.
- Why?

08:11.403 --> 08:13.188
Sandra wanted to leave
something for her daughter

08:13.318 --> 08:15.538
and grandson in case she...

08:15.669 --> 08:18.715
couldn't make things right
before...

08:20.064 --> 08:20.978
Can I talk to her?

08:21.109 --> 08:22.066
Sure.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.198
She'll answer your questions.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.069
Well, most of them.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.204
Sandra, hi.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.206
My name is Jessica.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.425
How are you today?

08:33.556 --> 08:36.472
I'm good, hon. How are you?

08:36.603 --> 08:38.692
Great.

08:38.822 --> 08:41.390
We are here
to solve your murder.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.044
Okay, that's it. I'm out.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.698
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, anywhere but here.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.439
By the way, gargoyles
are better than this.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.398
Better than
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

08:49.529 --> 08:51.313
to interview the murder victim?

08:51.443 --> 08:53.489
- Knight, what are you gonna ask
her? It's not like she knows

08:53.620 --> 08:55.404
who killed...

08:56.753 --> 08:58.886
Hey, Sandra, who shot you?

08:59.016 --> 09:02.063
I'm sorry,
can you rephrase the question?

09:02.193 --> 09:03.804
- Mm.
Well, she's not
gonna know directly,

09:03.934 --> 09:06.894
but maybe there's a story
about her past

09:07.024 --> 09:08.983
that can help us
with our investigation.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.550
Hmm, yeah, okay, well,
that's all you.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.029
I'm going back
to the land of the living

09:12.160 --> 09:13.683
and investigate this
the good old-fashioned way.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.251
You enjoy your a-séance.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.558
- I'll walk you out.
- Okay.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.566
Okay, Sandra.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.263
Let's talk about your life.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.482
Sure, hon.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.703
I love talking about myself.

09:35.270 --> 09:39.230
It's called synthetic reality,
and it's totally awesome.

09:39.361 --> 09:42.625
The person being hologrammed
sits surrounded

09:42.756 --> 09:45.585
by hundreds of lights
and special cameras.

09:45.715 --> 09:46.847
They're then interviewed
for days,

09:46.977 --> 09:48.675
answering countless questions.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.765
Yeah, the dead lady had
a full conversation with us.

09:51.895 --> 09:54.332
Exactly. Once the recording
is complete,

09:54.463 --> 09:56.204
the system registers
trigger words,

09:56.334 --> 09:59.773
which allows the hologram
to communicate with the user.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.123
- Oh, so cool.
- Right?

10:02.253 --> 10:04.604
Not cool. Creepy.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.301
I am totally doing this
before I die.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.607
Oh, it's gonna cost you.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.913
A-A quarter of a million dollars
to be exact.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.524
- Hmm.
- That is, unless you have
the right connections.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.135
Do you guys remember

10:14.265 --> 10:15.876
the hologram of Tupac
that performed

10:16.006 --> 10:17.617
at Coachella a few years back?

10:17.747 --> 10:19.314
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.490
Oh, I was there to see it live.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.013
It changed my life.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.493
I've actually, uh,

10:24.624 --> 10:26.277
dabbled in the art form
ever since.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.628
I just try to keep it on
the DL because there's only

10:28.758 --> 10:31.326
so much nerd I'm willing
to show in public, you know?

10:31.456 --> 10:32.806
There we go.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.243
I don't know, Kasie, you know,
nerds are cool nowadays.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.636
Agree to disagree.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.899
Do you guys want
to see my hologram rig or not?

10:39.029 --> 10:41.031
I've been hiding it in the back
office for the past six months,

10:41.162 --> 10:42.990
waiting for the right moment
to break it out.

10:43.120 --> 10:47.037
And there's never gonna be
a better moment than this one.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.300
Kasie, lead the way.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.824
And voilà.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.347
You hologrammed a rat?

10:52.477 --> 10:53.783
That, Nick,

10:53.914 --> 10:57.134
is my pet hamster
Mr. Belvedere.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.527
Why?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.834
why not?

11:00.964 --> 11:02.357
I-I needed
a test subject,

11:02.487 --> 11:03.663
and Mr. Belvedere brings me

11:03.793 --> 11:05.012
so much joy at home.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.667
So, voilà, I brought
him to the office.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.017
Does it talk?

11:10.147 --> 11:11.496
He's a hamster.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.194
Kasie, this is incredible.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.891
I've got a thousand more
questions about this,

11:15.022 --> 11:16.676
but I got to go check
with Jimmy,

11:16.806 --> 11:18.199
see if he has anything.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.417
I'm coming back, though.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.202
- I'm worried about you.
- I hologram

11:21.332 --> 11:23.900
one hamster, and all of a sudden
you get all judgy.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.685
Hmm.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.296
Hey, Jimmy.

11:30.037 --> 11:33.736
Hey, let me ask you something,
one, uh, one parent to another.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.651
Yeah, of course. What's up?

11:36.913 --> 11:39.699
Why would a mom who's estranged
from their daughter

11:39.829 --> 11:42.702
spend weeks making a hologram
for her?

11:42.832 --> 11:44.878
You know, not try
and reconcile with her?

11:45.008 --> 11:46.053
Yeah, I was wondering
the same thing.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.620
Then I discovered
that Sandra here

11:48.751 --> 11:52.015
had a rare melanoma that was
spreading throughout her body.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.017
She was dying.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.453
Did she know?

11:57.020 --> 11:57.717
Yeah, according to her medical
records, she was diagnosed

11:57.847 --> 11:59.414
a few months ago.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.286
So, she knew she didn't
have enough time

12:02.417 --> 12:03.897
to make things right
with her daughter,

12:04.027 --> 12:06.029
created a hologram
to leave behind.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.249
In the hopes that one day
her daughter

12:08.379 --> 12:11.208
might interact with it, yeah.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.645
I tell you what, man,
if I couldn't see my kids

12:13.776 --> 12:16.170
before I died,
I would move heaven and earth

12:16.300 --> 12:18.259
to make sure they knew
how much I loved them.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.175
Whatever drastic measure
it took.

12:23.090 --> 12:26.267
Oh, speaking of kids,
Sandra's daughter just got here.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.967
Ruby, there's no easy way
to say this.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.624
Your mother was
murdered last night.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.283
Okay.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.763
Thanks for letting me know.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.200
If that's all, uh,
I'm late for work.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.117
You must think I'm heartless.

12:50.247 --> 12:53.947
But I've been mad at my mom for
so long that I don't know how

12:54.077 --> 12:56.297
to feel
anything else.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.342
Even right now.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.954
Ruby, I understand, I really do.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.304
But I can
assure you,

13:03.434 --> 13:06.873
that your mother loved you
very much.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.136
Wait, don't tell me you watched

13:09.266 --> 13:10.790
that stupid hologram
thing she made.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.139
So you know about it?

13:12.269 --> 13:13.836
She told me about it
in a letter.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.534
I won't talk to her,
so she's been writing letters,

13:16.665 --> 13:18.145
trying to reconcile.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.799
Well, that hologram

13:19.929 --> 13:22.105
might actually help us
solve her murder.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.020
How is that?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.848
Sandra told me
that she received

13:25.979 --> 13:27.807
a threatening note
in the mail last week.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.158
I found this in her nightstand,

13:31.288 --> 13:32.507
took it into evidence.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.162
"You will pay for what you did."

13:35.292 --> 13:36.990
What did your mother do?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.992
Why didn't you ask her yourself?

13:39.122 --> 13:40.558
I did.

13:40.689 --> 13:45.520
She seemed very apologetic
but wouldn't give many details.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.782
Of course
she wouldn't.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.828
And you can't find
out any details

13:48.958 --> 13:50.525
because the records
are sealed.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.353
What records?

13:52.483 --> 13:54.355
The court records.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.358
You heard of Bernie Madoff?

13:57.488 --> 14:00.187
My mother was like
the female version.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.320
She embezzled money
from her clients?

14:03.451 --> 14:04.974
Millions of dollars.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.020
Why didn't she go to prison?

14:07.150 --> 14:09.239
Ask her high-powered lawyer.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.024
He got her off scot-free.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.765
I can see why that'd be
a tough pill to swallow

14:13.896 --> 14:15.550
- for her victims.
- It was.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.207
And I'll bet one of them
finally got their revenge.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.566
Sandra built
her investment advisory firm

14:31.696 --> 14:32.828
from the ground up.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.569
And then about four years ago,

14:34.699 --> 14:36.701
she was accused of embezzling
millions of dollars

14:36.832 --> 14:39.008
- from her own clients.
- But she never went
to prison for it.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.618
She walked away with probation.

14:40.749 --> 14:41.663
A slap on the wrist considering

14:41.793 --> 14:42.882
how much damage she caused.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.319
Yeah, I'd say that must have

14:45.449 --> 14:46.842
pissed off her victims.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.452
Maybe enough to kill.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.584
You got a list?

14:49.714 --> 14:50.846
Working on it.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.587
Official court records
are sealed.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.111
Every plaintiff signed
an ironclad NDA.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.243
That's how they were able
to keep

14:56.373 --> 14:57.722
this whole thing
out of the media.

14:57.853 --> 14:58.767
Her lawyer made sure
that lawsuit

14:58.898 --> 15:00.377
never saw the light of day.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.552
What's her lawyer's name?

15:01.683 --> 15:03.206
Albert Beck.

15:03.337 --> 15:05.295
I'll bet he's got a list of
the people Sandra stole from.

15:05.426 --> 15:08.342
Let's go sweet-talk him
out of it.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.783
What?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.785
We have new info on Sandra.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.091
Yeah?

15:18.221 --> 15:20.702
So let's go see what she has
to say about it.

15:20.832 --> 15:24.662
What she has to say?
She's laying dead in autopsy.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.274
I know. Isn't it cool?

15:28.275 --> 15:29.537
Nah, not really.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.109
Ruby, when you were little,
you had the cutest lisp.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.763
And when you got mad,
it was even worse.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.203
You outgrew the lisp,

15:43.333 --> 15:46.902
but unfortunately your anger
toward me never went away.

15:47.033 --> 15:50.340
Ben was always easier
for me to talk to.

15:50.471 --> 15:53.822
But I could never get
on the same page with you, Ruby.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.477
I wanted to, believe me.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.827
I just didn't know how.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.003
Uh, Geoffrey?

16:01.830 --> 16:02.962
Oh, hi.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.964
Sorry, I just...

16:05.094 --> 16:06.966
I was starting it up for
you, and I guess I...

16:07.096 --> 16:09.272
just got sucked in.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.579
To tell you
the truth,

16:11.709 --> 16:13.320
I've been missing her a lot.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.149
I'm sure you meant
a lot to her, too.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.456
I'll leave you two alone.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.940
Thanks.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.992
What are you waiting for?
Ask her why she stole millions.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.255
I am choosing my words
carefully.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.517
Why?

16:37.822 --> 16:38.998
Well, it's not just a thing
that you blurt out.

16:40.477 --> 16:41.565
It's a hologram. It's not
like you're gonna offend it.

16:42.958 --> 16:43.828
Rude is rude. It doesn't matter
who you offend.

16:45.395 --> 16:46.266
Okay, well, why don't you ask
her what happened nicely?

16:46.396 --> 16:47.528
Okay.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.314
Sandra, how did you get
your business started?

16:51.445 --> 16:53.012
Well, back in my day,

16:53.142 --> 16:54.883
there weren't that many women
on Wall Street,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.538
let alone with their own
investment firms.

16:57.668 --> 17:03.239
My mom wanted me to be
a secretary or a teacher.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.154
But I wanted to own
my own business.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.852
I wanted to be in control
of my own life.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.203
Was your mother upset
with your decision?

17:10.333 --> 17:11.552
She was.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.381
But I knew I was doing
the right thing for myself.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.557
Was stealing from your clients
the right thing?

17:16.687 --> 17:17.906
Nick.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.040
That was the single worst choice
of my life.

17:21.170 --> 17:24.217
My heart breaks
for every family that was hurt

17:24.347 --> 17:26.915
because of what I did.

17:27.046 --> 17:31.050
And no family was hurt worse
than ours, Ruby.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.226
We both know that Ben
took his own life

17:33.356 --> 17:36.577
because of the horrible choice
that I made.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.970
Who's Ben?
Her son.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.624
He was humiliated.

17:40.755 --> 17:45.412
And I have to live
with that fact every single day.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.761
Well, that's odd.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.067
What is odd?

17:48.197 --> 17:49.938
The police report said he died

17:50.069 --> 17:52.071
in a car accident.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.073
A single-car accident
off a bridge.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.987
The same day Sandra
was arrested.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.729
It's my fault that Ben is gone,

17:58.860 --> 18:01.950
and I understand why
you can't forgive me.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.518
I can't forgive me either.

18:04.648 --> 18:09.653
But I am so thankful
that you took Austin in.

18:09.784 --> 18:13.440
You stepped up and you raised
your nephew as your own.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.443
You always made
such good choices, Ruby.

18:16.573 --> 18:20.099
I'm so sorry
that I couldn't do the same.

18:20.229 --> 18:25.234
Ruby, you and Austin
mean everything to me.

18:25.365 --> 18:28.629
I love you, sweetie.

18:32.850 --> 18:35.636
I've known Sandy for years,
and believe me,

18:35.766 --> 18:37.290
she was all heart.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.684
She spent the last few years
giving back to charities.

18:40.815 --> 18:43.122
She was selfless.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.124
Yeah, a selfless thief?

18:45.254 --> 18:46.995
She never intended to steal.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.606
Her cash flow
got tight,

18:49.737 --> 18:54.002
and she borrowed from certain
clients to pay off others.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.265
Which is illegal.

18:56.396 --> 18:59.964
She'd be the first to admit
it was a terrible choice.

19:00.139 --> 19:04.012
And a choice
that maybe got her killed.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.624
Sandra received
a threatening note

19:07.755 --> 19:09.278
shortly before her murder.

19:09.409 --> 19:12.586
And we think it might have been
from one of those clients

19:12.716 --> 19:14.109
she borrowed from.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.677
Mm. And since the court records
are sealed,

19:16.807 --> 19:19.332
uh, you came to ask me
for the list of names.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.117
If you want to solve
your friend's murder.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.641
Happy to share
the list, but...

19:24.772 --> 19:27.862
I think you might be
barking up the wrong tree.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.864
And why is that?

19:29.994 --> 19:30.908
Part of Sandra's deal

19:31.039 --> 19:32.693
was to pay restitution

19:32.823 --> 19:35.086
to all of her victims,
which she did.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.045
There are certainly other people
out there

19:37.176 --> 19:39.265
that I would be more
suspicious of

19:39.395 --> 19:41.354
than her
former victims.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.747
Why do I get the sense
that you're thinking

19:43.878 --> 19:46.097
of someone specific?

19:46.228 --> 19:49.057
It's probably nothing,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.538
but the last time
I met with Sandra,

19:51.668 --> 19:55.063
her valet Geoffrey
was acting very strange.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
He seemed agitated.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.459
And when I asked
Sandra about it,

19:59.589 --> 20:02.462
she said that she had
just told Geoffrey

20:02.592 --> 20:05.378
that she decided
to take him out of her will.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.554
Did he do something
to upset her?

20:07.684 --> 20:08.511
No.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.905
Not at all. After court costs

20:11.035 --> 20:12.689
and paying back her victims,

20:12.820 --> 20:15.431
her fortune
was dwindling.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.651
And she wanted to leave
what she had left

20:17.781 --> 20:19.305
to her grandson Austin.

20:19.435 --> 20:24.440
Needless to say, that was
a very uncomfortable meeting.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.013
You okay?

20:32.143 --> 20:33.971
Yeah.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.495
Ever since you met
that hologram,

20:35.625 --> 20:37.758
you've been, uh, a little off.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.934
That's a sentence you
don't hear every day.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.416
No, seriously, what's up?

20:45.113 --> 20:47.463
I just think it's
this case, you know?

20:47.594 --> 20:50.727
The disconnect between
Sandra and Ruby just...

20:50.858 --> 20:52.512
hits a little close
to home for me.

20:52.642 --> 20:57.125
Hmm. You and your mom,
uh, fight a lot?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.170
Not anymore.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.216
We haven't spoken
to each other in months.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.131
Why is that?

21:04.306 --> 21:06.395
Hey, fair enough.

21:06.526 --> 21:09.224
I appreciate you asking,
though.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.400
But my mom and I...

21:12.488 --> 21:14.011
...it's complicated.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.275
Does she love you?

21:17.145 --> 21:18.102
Yeah.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.017
And you love her?

21:20.148 --> 21:21.628
Yeah.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.718
Then maybe it's not
as complicated as you think.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.379
I was able to lift
two sets of prints

21:33.509 --> 21:34.858
off the note Sandra received.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.295
Sandra's, of course,

21:36.425 --> 21:37.644
and also Geoffrey's.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.298
Well, no surprise,

21:39.428 --> 21:40.560
since he received the mail.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.301
Which is why I asked
Sandra's lawyer

21:42.431 --> 21:46.609
to send over a few samples
of Geoffrey's handwriting.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.177
They look like a match.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.354
There's only seven words.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.443
Is that really enough
to make a match?

21:54.574 --> 21:57.490
Seriously, Nick, you think
that's all I got? Ooh.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.669
- What are we looking at?
- The postmark.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.454
According to it, the letter
originated from a post office

22:05.585 --> 22:08.022
in Boise, Idaho
a few weeks ago.

22:08.152 --> 22:12.331
The problem is, that post
office closed two years ago.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.507
- So it's a fake?
- Yep, someone stamped

22:14.637 --> 22:17.771
the envelope to make it look
as though it had been mailed,

22:17.901 --> 22:20.339
but it was actually just
placed inside the mailbox.

22:20.469 --> 22:24.212
And the only person that
had access to the mailbox

22:24.343 --> 22:26.606
other than Sandra was...

22:26.736 --> 22:27.563
Geoffrey.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.609
Mm-hmm.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.439
It's always the butler.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.360
Clear.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.275
Clear.

22:49.585 --> 22:50.934
In here!

22:53.894 --> 22:54.851
You got him?

22:54.982 --> 22:56.157
No.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.854
I think Geoffrey's gone.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.380
And he took Sandra with him.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.260
So Geoffrey bolts and takes

23:12.391 --> 23:15.568
his little
hologram friend with him.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.266
Is that considered kidnapping?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.268
My vote is on grave-robbing.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.400
Why not piracy?

23:21.530 --> 23:23.924
Okay, all of the above.

23:24.054 --> 23:25.491
We're thinking that Geoffrey
killed Sandra

23:25.621 --> 23:28.537
because she cut him out
of her will.

23:28.668 --> 23:30.409
And since he knew
that we're using her hologram

23:30.539 --> 23:33.150
to help us find the killer,
he took it with him.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.501
Still no hits on the BOLO.

23:35.631 --> 23:38.068
And no cell signal
or credit card purchases

23:38.199 --> 23:39.418
in the last six hours.

23:39.548 --> 23:40.854
He's definitely on the run.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.595
Question is, where to?

23:44.510 --> 23:44.814
As far as we can tell, he has
no family, no friends nearby.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.817
His entire life was
dedicated to Sandra.

23:47.948 --> 23:51.212
If anyone could give us an idea
as to where Geoffrey went,

23:51.342 --> 23:52.692
it'd be her.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.171
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing, so I called

23:54.302 --> 23:56.217
the company that created
Sandra's hologram

23:56.347 --> 23:57.827
to request their backup file.

23:57.958 --> 24:00.134
- Ah. Smart.
- They didn't
give it up easily.

24:00.264 --> 24:02.658
But once they heard the words
"murder" and "subpoena,"

24:02.789 --> 24:05.052
the file magically appeared
in my inbox.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.097
Problem is,
the company tech

24:07.228 --> 24:10.318
warned me that the system
is incredibly hard to set up.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.146
And they're located
in Switzerland,

24:12.276 --> 24:15.062
so they can't send someone
out here to help us for a week.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.498
We don't have a week.

24:16.629 --> 24:21.460
No, but we do have
an in-house hologram expert.

24:22.983 --> 24:27.030
Okay, I think
we just about got it.

24:27.161 --> 24:28.989
Okay, and...

24:29.119 --> 24:30.381
voilà.

24:31.426 --> 24:32.471
Ooh.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.647
No, don't got it.

24:34.777 --> 24:37.171
Uh, Director,
you're a man of details.

24:37.301 --> 24:40.479
I see this is at
about 33 degrees.

24:40.609 --> 24:45.005
I need it to be at 33.3 degrees.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.007
Oh, forgive me, Ms. Hines.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.487
Oh, no, forgiven.

24:48.617 --> 24:49.966
Like I said before,

24:50.097 --> 24:52.186
crafting holograms
is a matter of precision.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.970
Understood.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.146
Okay.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.626
Ooh, much better.

24:58.932 --> 24:59.889
Pretty cool, huh?

25:00.020 --> 25:02.022
It's incredible.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.373
How'd you learn to do this?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.331
Oh, by practicing
on Mr. Belvedere.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.376
On who?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.595
Her pet rat.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.206
You hologrammed
your pet rat?

25:12.336 --> 25:13.816
No, that's ridiculous.

25:13.947 --> 25:16.515
Mr. Belvedere is a hamster.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.039
Come on, Director,
who would hologram a rat?

25:19.169 --> 25:22.390
I'm embarrassed I didn't see
the distinction.

25:24.392 --> 25:25.654
Wow, Kase.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.526
She looks just like she did
in her house.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.876
Ugh, should work the same, too.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.533
Sandra, hi again.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.970
We were hoping we could
ask you a few more questions.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.885
That's why I'm here, hon.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.887
What would you like
to talk about today?

25:41.017 --> 25:42.584
Your assistant Geoffrey.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.107
Oh.

25:44.238 --> 25:49.069
Well, for starters,
Geoffrey's a big sweetheart.

25:49.199 --> 25:52.855
An enormous help to me.
A blessing from above.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.378
What else would you
like to know about him?

25:54.509 --> 25:55.815
Where is he?

25:56.903 --> 25:58.687
I can't tell you where Geoffrey
is in the moment

25:58.818 --> 26:00.341
because I'm a hologram.

26:00.515 --> 26:01.560
Yeah, yeah, we know.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.083
What we don't know is,

26:03.213 --> 26:04.824
did he like going places?

26:04.954 --> 26:07.087
With me? Sure.

26:07.217 --> 26:08.610
We would hit

26:08.741 --> 26:12.440
at least three farmers markets
every Sunday.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.920
What about without you?

26:14.050 --> 26:17.924
Eh, Geoffrey's no social
butterfly, that's for sure.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.579
But he did like to get away
every once in a while.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.581
Where would he like to go?

26:22.711 --> 26:25.409
Camping. Like you, Ruby.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.803
I'd let him go out
onto our land

26:27.934 --> 26:30.719
to recharge whenever he felt
the need to clear his head.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.113
To the same spot I took you
when you were a kid.

26:33.243 --> 26:38.118
There was something magical
about that place.

26:38.248 --> 26:42.688
I just wish I'd taken
you and Ben there more often.

26:42.818 --> 26:44.951
I'm sure you feel the same.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.213
Ms. Hines...

26:47.388 --> 26:48.476
...pull up all the land records

26:48.607 --> 26:50.434
registered to Sandra Holdren.

26:50.565 --> 26:51.610
Yeah, on it.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.834
Okay, she purchased
over 1,200 acres

26:58.965 --> 27:02.316
in the backwoods
of Elk Creek, Virginia in 1986.

27:02.446 --> 27:05.101
And still had the deed in her
name at the time of her death.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.974
The camping spot must be
somewhere on that land.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.802
But that is way too big
of a search radius.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.978
We need some kind of direction.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.589
What we need is a guide.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.680
Good seeing you again, Ruby.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.639
Yeah, I appreciate you,
uh, talking to us.

27:20.769 --> 27:23.250
Let's get this over with.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.078
Okay, so I guess we're walking?

27:25.208 --> 27:27.123
For now.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.517
Your mom really lit up when
she talked about this place.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.866
She called it a sanctuary.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.521
Yeah, it was, for me and Ben.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.349
Mom's sanctuary was her office.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.003
Damn.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.614
I thought this bridge
was way bigger.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.530
Guess I was just smaller.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.099
I used to climb the railings
as a kid.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.710
And one day,
when I was, like, 11...

27:48.841 --> 27:50.886
You fell off and broke your arm?

27:51.931 --> 27:53.672
Your mother told me that, too.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.674
You two, uh, old friends now?

27:55.804 --> 27:58.154
Swapping stories over
a glass of Chardonnay?

27:58.285 --> 28:01.549
I drink beer, like you.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.248
Wow, Agent Knight,
you just know it all.

28:05.379 --> 28:08.295
I don't know why your mom
called your injury

28:08.425 --> 28:10.950
one of the most memorable times
of her life.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.561
She said that?

28:16.433 --> 28:18.871
The break was so bad, I
couldn't even go to school.

28:19.001 --> 28:22.570
My mom stayed home from work
to take care of me.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.920
We ate all 52 flavors

28:25.051 --> 28:27.270
of Ben & Jerry's
in less than two weeks.

28:27.401 --> 28:31.666
That was the last time
she put me before her career.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.103
She did a great job
growing her business.

28:34.234 --> 28:37.890
Problem was, she forgot
to raise her kids.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.240
Did she mention that, too?

28:41.241 --> 28:42.721
She did.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.723
And that she regretted it.

28:44.853 --> 28:47.290
But she was thankful
that your brother Ben

28:47.421 --> 28:48.596
was able to help out at home.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.077
Help out? More like take over.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.949
Ben was my brother,
protector and teacher

28:54.080 --> 28:56.909
and dad all rolled into one.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.737
Sounds like a hell of a guy.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.521
He was the best.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.611
Yet my mom
still screwed him over.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.875
What she did was unforgivable.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.616
Ben deserved better.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.879
You're right.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.925
Ben should still be here.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.754
But so should
your mom.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.759
You two really think
Geoffrey killed her?

29:20.889 --> 29:22.456
I highly doubt it.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.458
He may be cringey
and an ass-kisser,

29:24.588 --> 29:25.807
but he loved my mom.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.244
And he doesn't have the balls
to kill her.

29:33.684 --> 29:36.078
It's a rugged ride.
Try to keep up.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.692
Um...

29:41.823 --> 29:43.956
yeah, so you're in my seat.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.307
You coming?

30:02.888 --> 30:05.325
Oh, come on.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.156
I forgot how fun
these ATVs are.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.027
Yeah, that was a rush.
Right, Nick?

30:12.158 --> 30:12.985
Mm-hmm.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.901
There it is. The old camp.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.685
You really think
Geoffrey's there?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.687
I don't think
that fire lit itself.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.341
We should walk
the rest of the way

30:21.471 --> 30:23.343
so he doesn't hear us coming.

30:25.606 --> 30:26.825
It's too late.

30:26.955 --> 30:30.045
Geoffrey, freeze!

30:33.440 --> 30:34.745
Federal agents!

30:42.536 --> 30:45.408
You're right. ATVs are awesome.

30:49.891 --> 30:53.025
My face is killing me.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.940
Shouldn't have run.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.680
I didn't know
who was chasing me.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.421
That was a federal agent.

30:58.552 --> 31:02.077
Your first hint was
when he yelled, "Federal agent!"

31:07.387 --> 31:08.344
Here.

31:08.475 --> 31:09.998
Use that for the swelling.

31:10.781 --> 31:11.913
Seriously?

31:12.044 --> 31:13.393
Oh, yeah, ice
machine was broken.

31:13.523 --> 31:14.481
Found those in the, uh,

31:14.611 --> 31:16.875
breakroom freezer. Wontons.

31:17.005 --> 31:19.399
Those are my wontons.

31:19.529 --> 31:21.401
That's my bad.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.143
Why am I here?

31:24.273 --> 31:27.015
"You will pay for what you did."

31:27.146 --> 31:29.061
It's not exactly
a love note.

31:29.191 --> 31:30.584
But it does have
your handwriting

31:30.714 --> 31:31.890
and fingerprints on it.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.500
Sandra's hologram told
us where to find it.

31:33.630 --> 31:37.721
Which is why you stole
the hologram system and ran.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.767
You were afraid
of what else

31:39.898 --> 31:42.204
Holo-Sandra might say.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.685
Okay.

31:44.815 --> 31:47.862
I left the note,
but I didn't steal her.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.560
And I did <i>not</i> kill her.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.519
Then why threaten her?

31:52.649 --> 31:56.784
Because I was angry when
she took me out of her will.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.786
And...

31:59.526 --> 32:01.397
"And"? What?

32:01.528 --> 32:03.269
And...

32:04.009 --> 32:07.838
someone paid me $50,000
to write it.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.277
Who?

32:11.407 --> 32:12.713
I don't know.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.019
One day, out of nowhere,

32:14.149 --> 32:15.542
I got an encrypted email
from somebody

32:15.672 --> 32:18.719
who said that they were a victim
of one of her scams.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.547
How were you paid?

32:20.677 --> 32:24.159
- Bitcoin.
- You don't get 50 grand
to just write a note,

32:24.290 --> 32:26.988
but you do get
that kind of money to do a hit.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.251
I keep telling you,
I did not kill her.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.906
I swear on my
- mother's grave.
- We don't accept

32:32.037 --> 32:34.474
mothers' graves as alibis here.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.910
You got another one?

32:36.041 --> 32:37.912
I was at my cousin's wedding
in North Carolina

32:38.043 --> 32:38.957
the night Sandra died.

32:39.087 --> 32:41.133
A hundred people
saw me there.

32:41.263 --> 32:44.179
Do you want to see pictures?

32:54.059 --> 32:57.149
All right, so, so much
for Kasie's, uh, theory

32:57.279 --> 32:58.846
that it's always
the butler.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.543
Yeah. Her new theory should
be, "It's always the butler

33:00.674 --> 33:02.154
except when the
butler has an alibi."

33:02.284 --> 33:04.243
Wait,
he's telling the truth?

33:04.373 --> 33:07.072
When Sandra was killed,
he was on a time-stamped video

33:07.202 --> 33:08.682
at a wedding reception

33:08.812 --> 33:09.900
dancing his
little heart out.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.598
Chicken dance?

33:11.728 --> 33:13.034
How'd you guess?

33:13.165 --> 33:14.993
I got a sixth sense
about these things.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.951
Well, can your sixth sense
tell us

33:17.082 --> 33:18.866
who paid Geoffrey
to threaten Sandra?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.215
Because whoever's
behind this note

33:20.346 --> 33:22.174
is the only suspect
we have left.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.698
And unfortunately
they used a special Bitcoin

33:24.828 --> 33:26.004
that is untraceable.

33:26.134 --> 33:27.831
Well, never say
"untraceable."

33:27.962 --> 33:29.790
Parker and I came in early

33:29.920 --> 33:31.661
to help Kasie follow
the digital money trail.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.141
The payment and the message

33:33.272 --> 33:36.144
to Geoffrey were both sent
using a Triple D.E.S.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.667
to ensure the output

33:37.798 --> 33:40.322
was all translated
- to ciphertext.
- Mm-hmm.

33:40.453 --> 33:43.195
Okay, so obviously we couldn't
isolate an encryption key.

33:44.022 --> 33:47.547
- Obviously.
- Yeah, but we were able
to find a backdoor

33:47.677 --> 33:50.767
that led us to a digital
wallet belonging to

33:50.898 --> 33:52.856
- a Jamie2
- Shoes147.

33:52.987 --> 33:55.511
Whoever sent Geoffrey the money
- used the name Jamie2
- Shoes

33:55.642 --> 33:58.036
on two of their online accounts
in the past.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.734
Which means it's probably
also their nickname.

34:00.864 --> 34:04.390
And worth running by our, uh,
translucent friend upstairs.

34:09.699 --> 34:12.050
Hey, Sandra,

34:12.180 --> 34:14.835
you know anyone
- by the name Jamie2
- Shoes?

34:14.965 --> 34:17.794
Well, yes, of course I do.

34:17.925 --> 34:18.926
And?

34:19.057 --> 34:20.754
And what?

34:20.884 --> 34:22.060
Tell us about 'em.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.062
Tell you about who?

34:24.192 --> 34:26.064
- Jamie2
- Shoes.

34:27.195 --> 34:30.416
Look at this. With you,
she's Chatty Cathy.

34:30.546 --> 34:33.375
I think it's the way
- you're asking.
- What?

34:35.160 --> 34:38.728
Sandra, what is
- Jamie2
- Shoes' real name?

34:38.859 --> 34:40.078
Government name?

34:40.208 --> 34:43.037
I'm sorry,
I don't understand the question.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.908
Okay, she's got to be tired.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.085
Right,
the first tired hologram. Okay.

34:50.349 --> 34:51.611
Sandra,

34:51.741 --> 34:53.613
- how did Jamie2
- Shoes

34:53.743 --> 34:55.528
get such a cool nickname?

34:55.658 --> 34:59.140
Oh, boy,
that was a really long time ago.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.577
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

35:01.708 --> 35:04.580
Jamie was running
for class president,

35:04.711 --> 35:07.105
and I was helping him prep
for his big debate.

35:07.235 --> 35:08.758
He was so nervous

35:08.889 --> 35:12.110
that he accidentally wore
two different kinds of shoes.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.155
So she went to school with him.

35:14.286 --> 35:17.941
Ask if it was, uh,
college or high school.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.378
College.

35:19.508 --> 35:20.988
Hmm.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.818
Sandra, what is
Jamie's last name?

35:24.948 --> 35:26.863
I'm sorry, can you rephrase?

35:26.994 --> 35:28.909
Okay, that's it. I'm out.

35:29.039 --> 35:33.522
Sandra, what did you
and Jamie do for fun?

35:33.653 --> 35:34.697
- Ruby,

35:34.828 --> 35:36.612
let's just say we made the most

35:36.743 --> 35:37.918
of our college experience.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.486
I always joke with
him that if people

35:40.616 --> 35:44.359
knew half of the stuff we did,
he'd be disbarred.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.971
Is Jamie your lawyer?

35:48.102 --> 35:51.192
The best in the business.

35:52.976 --> 35:57.372
Albert James Beck,
- aka Jamie2
- Shoes.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.157
He's been one
of Sandra's closest friends

35:59.287 --> 36:00.332
for 40 years.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.855
So why would he pay Geoffrey

36:01.985 --> 36:03.161
to threaten her life?

36:03.291 --> 36:04.597
You think
Beck was trying to frame him

36:04.727 --> 36:05.598
for Sandra's murder?

36:06.642 --> 36:07.165
But why would Beck
want Sandra dead

36:08.383 --> 36:09.079
in the first place?
What was his motive?

36:09.210 --> 36:10.690
Let's ask him.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.170
Not that easy.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.346
Beck's one of the top
defense attorneys in the state,

36:14.476 --> 36:16.870
and we have no hard evidence,
so he'll just stonewall us.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.306
Yeah, Nick's right.

36:18.437 --> 36:19.699
We better have the goods
on this guy

36:19.829 --> 36:21.440
before we haul him in
and accuse him of murder.

36:21.570 --> 36:22.919
Or we could just bring him in

36:23.050 --> 36:24.356
and hope
he gives up the goods himself.

36:24.486 --> 36:27.054
You think we can break him
in interrogation?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.056
Not us.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.232
Then who?

36:31.363 --> 36:33.321
When Sandra first told me

36:33.452 --> 36:35.323
she was gonna do
this hologram thing,

36:35.454 --> 36:38.718
I thought it's a waste of money.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.241
I was wrong.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.112
This is a beautiful gift

36:42.243 --> 36:44.332
she left behind for Ruby.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.465
Just hope she sees it one day.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.685
We hope so, too. But
for now, we, uh...

36:49.816 --> 36:53.385
we appreciate that you're here.
We could really use your help.

36:53.515 --> 36:56.126
As you know, we've been speaking
to Sandra for a few days,

36:56.257 --> 36:57.302
trying to solve her murder.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.478
But as helpful
as she's been,

36:59.608 --> 37:01.610
we still have a lot
of unanswered questions.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.743
So we decided to bring
in some of her friends

37:03.873 --> 37:08.095
to help elaborate on some
of what she's been saying.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.314
And since she told us

37:09.444 --> 37:11.229
that you are
her best friend...

37:11.359 --> 37:14.536
[chuckles]...we just thought that you
would be the perfect guinea pig

37:14.667 --> 37:16.103
- to start with.
- She said that?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.496
She did.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.368
She really loved you.

37:21.761 --> 37:22.936
Think he's acting?

37:23.066 --> 37:24.764
I think we're
about to find out.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.635
So, what can I do for you?

37:26.766 --> 37:28.071
Do you have a suspect?

37:28.202 --> 37:29.943
Yeah. Here. Uh,
have a seat.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.902
Actually, uh, now that
you mention it, we do.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.252
We're, uh,

37:34.382 --> 37:38.256
we're looking
- for somebody called Jamie2
- Shoes.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.953
Does that nickname
sound familiar?

37:40.083 --> 37:41.824
No, no.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.609
I don't think so.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.916
Are you sure?
Because it does for Sandra.

37:47.047 --> 37:50.964
Sandra, what is your friend
Albert Beck's nickname?

37:51.747 --> 37:54.228
I gave Albert
- the nickname Jamie2
- Shoes

37:54.359 --> 37:56.186
back in college.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.797
I don't think he
liked it much,

37:57.927 --> 38:01.627
but I did. I made damn sure
that sucker stuck.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.717
I honestly forgot
she called me that.

38:04.847 --> 38:05.979
Uh,

38:06.109 --> 38:09.243
we're talking decades ago.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.593
Sandra,
what was the most fun

38:11.724 --> 38:13.378
that you and Jamie
ever had together?

38:13.508 --> 38:16.294
What's the point?
Oh, that's easy.

38:16.424 --> 38:17.860
The night we graduated,

38:17.991 --> 38:20.863
we both stripped down naked
and we jumped

38:20.994 --> 38:22.387
into the campus fountain.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.519
Thank the Lord it was

38:24.650 --> 38:26.652
before the social media era.

38:26.782 --> 38:29.959
He was so drunk, I'm not sure
he'd even remember that night.

38:30.090 --> 38:31.657
I think he does.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.876
So do I.

38:34.007 --> 38:36.401
Sandra, what was

38:36.531 --> 38:39.795
the darkest time of your life?

38:40.579 --> 38:44.234
My arrest
and then the loss of my son,

38:44.365 --> 38:45.888
without question.

38:46.019 --> 38:49.327
Some days, I don't know
how I made it through.

38:50.197 --> 38:54.027
Sandra, where was Jamie
during this time?

38:54.157 --> 38:56.638
Right by my side.

38:56.769 --> 38:59.337
I couldn't have done it
without him.

38:59.467 --> 39:01.339
He coached me
through the settlement.

39:01.469 --> 39:03.558
He kept me out of prison.

39:04.429 --> 39:07.562
He was much more
than just my lawyer.

39:08.389 --> 39:11.261
He was my best friend.

39:11.392 --> 39:14.656
I love Jamie like a brother.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.879
I love you, too, Sandy.

39:20.706 --> 39:23.752
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.452
I needed money.

39:27.582 --> 39:31.020
And Ben was an easy target.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.414
Sandra's son?

39:34.546 --> 39:38.245
Sandra never embezzled
any money.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.510
I convinced Ben

39:42.641 --> 39:45.992
to help me steal the money,

39:46.122 --> 39:50.562
and then, then I pinned
the whole thing on him.

39:50.692 --> 39:53.260
She was just covering
for her son.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.654
So, why kill her now?

39:55.784 --> 40:00.746
She never stopped investigating.

40:00.876 --> 40:03.444
Never let up.

40:03.575 --> 40:07.796
And she was coming too close
to finding out the truth.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.325
I'm so sorry, Sandy.

40:16.109 --> 40:18.590
I'm so sorry,

40:18.720 --> 40:20.679
Sandy.

40:25.553 --> 40:29.078
So, my mom never actually stole
from anyone?

40:29.209 --> 40:32.038
She just pled guilty?

40:32.168 --> 40:34.040
Beck framed your brother.

40:34.170 --> 40:36.303
I can't believe this.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.523
Your mom thought
Ben stole the money,

40:38.653 --> 40:41.439
so she covered for him.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.441
She sacrificed herself

40:43.571 --> 40:46.139
so your brother
wouldn't have to go to jail.

40:46.922 --> 40:50.404
I wish I would have known
what really happened.

40:50.535 --> 40:53.538
Why do you think
she never told you the truth?

40:53.668 --> 40:56.976
Even after your brother died?

41:00.762 --> 41:03.461
Because my big brother
was my hero

41:03.591 --> 41:05.593
and my best friend.

41:05.724 --> 41:09.467
My mom wasn't going
to take that away from me.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.904
Were you guys able to find

41:12.034 --> 41:13.122
her stolen hologram?

41:13.253 --> 41:15.081
Yes. It was hidden
in Beck's office.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.778
Stealing it
was part of the plan

41:16.909 --> 41:20.347
to pin the murder
onto Geoffrey.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.697
Where is it now?

41:22.828 --> 41:24.525
Here.

41:26.222 --> 41:29.095
Would you like to go see her?

41:32.838 --> 41:34.535
Come on.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.802
I'll be right behind you guys.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.508
Have a seat.

41:53.293 --> 41:54.860
Mom?

41:56.296 --> 41:57.732
Hi.

41:58.559 --> 42:00.692
You ready, Ruby?

42:02.171 --> 42:05.523
Yeah. I think so.

42:14.401 --> 42:18.274
Mom. Hi.

42:18.405 --> 42:20.886
Hi, Ruby.
