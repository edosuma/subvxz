WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:04.000
shing my underwear? 

00:04.059 --> 00:05.760
like i do everything else
around here--

00:05.830 --> 00:08.900
with a song on my lips
and love in my heart.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.260
i'm serious.

00:11.330 --> 00:14.660
i got a rash in my, you know,
private area.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.130
private? you get any more
traffic down there,

00:18.200 --> 00:19.400
you're gonna have to open
a starbucks.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.500
well, i thought maybe you'd
changed laundry soap,

00:24.560 --> 00:27.100
'cause it's all red and itchy
especially right around my...

00:27.160 --> 00:28.400
excuse me.

00:29.860 --> 00:33.130
i'm sitting here eating
a breakfast sausage.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.330
it's not a sausage problem.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.430
it's more in the meatball area.

00:43.060 --> 00:46.860
kind of meatball adjacent.

00:46.930 --> 00:48.330
||
bet it's swamp ass.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.260
what's swamp ass?

00:51.330 --> 00:54.330
don't worry.
you'd know if you had swamp ass.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.900
i hate swamp ass.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.230
you sure it's just a rash?
what else could it be?

01:00.300 --> 01:02.230
<i>well, since we're talking
about your private area,</i>

01:02.300 --> 01:05.300
it could anything from ebola
to mad cow disease.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.360
you get ebola
from monkeys, right?

01:07.430 --> 01:08.860
right.

01:08.930 --> 01:10.900
it's just a rash.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.130
a kid at school got swamp ass.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.230
cats followed him around
for a year.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.030
you know what?
let's just forget about it.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.560
oh, if only we could.

01:21.630 --> 01:24.260
speaking of school,
we've got a big day ahead of us.

01:24.330 --> 01:26.030
we've got to go shopping
for supplies, clothes.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.400
nice segue, dad.

01:28.460 --> 01:31.530
well, the subject was crying out
for change.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.460
anyway, you're starting
a new school.

01:33.530 --> 01:34.630
||
you're gonna need new stuff.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.230
wait a sec.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.260
melonhead made it
into junior high?

01:38.330 --> 01:39.260
||
yes.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.530
so you passed summer school?

01:41.600 --> 01:42.960
sort of.

01:43.030 --> 01:44.630
what do you mean, "sort of"?

01:44.700 --> 01:47.460
they said it was in everyone's
best interest if i moved on.

01:47.530 --> 01:49.300
||

01:49.360 --> 01:50.530
what's that supposed to mean?

01:50.600 --> 01:52.360
it means they promoted him.

01:52.430 --> 01:53.730
he's starting junior ||gh,
and there's absolutely nothing

01:53.800 --> 01:56.000
to be gained in asking
how or why.

01:56.060 --> 01:58.030
okay, well, whatever.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.730
i'm proud of you, man.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.700
||    for what?

02:00.760 --> 02:02.030
i don't know.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.000
hanging in there
until they were sick of you.

02:04.060 --> 02:05.760
thanks.

02:05.830 --> 02:08.930
so... junior high, huh?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.360
boy, that brings back
some memories, doesn't it, alan?

02:12.430 --> 02:14.600
can we please not go down
that road?||

02:14.660 --> 02:16.100
what happened?

02:16.160 --> 02:17.960
it's just that...

02:18.030 --> 02:19.960
kids in junior high
can be a little judgmental.

02:21.130 --> 02:23.330
especially if you're knocked up.

02:25.530 --> 02:28.600
thank you, berta.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.460
of course, on the up side,

02:30.530 --> 02:33.560
pregnant chicks didn't have
to go to gym.

02:33.630 --> 02:36.460
did the guys who got 'em
pregnant got any considerations?

02:36.530 --> 02:38.860
||
no, not even a hall pass.

02:38.930 --> 02:41.400
are we quite done?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.530
you'll see.
things will go great for you.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.960
you just have to remember
a few things.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.130
like what?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.760
well... always keep your
lunch money in your shoe

02:49.830 --> 02:51.900
but have some spare change
in your pocket.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.730
how come?
decoy money.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.060
they won't stop hitting you
till||hey get something.

02:56.130 --> 02:58.100
who are "they"?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.900
the big kids holding you
by your ankles

02:59.960 --> 03:01.900
||
and plunging your head
in the toilet.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.730
plunging my head
in the toilet?!

03:04.800 --> 03:07.330
don't, don't, don't, don't freak
||e kid out, alan.||

03:07.400 --> 03:10.860
it's not so much plunging
as dipping.

03:10.930 --> 03:12.930
berta:
here's what you do.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.330
make friends with
the janitor.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.560
||
they usually have
their own bathroom.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.660
okay.

03:18.730 --> 03:21.030
just never drink
out of his thermos.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.100
all right.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.200
and don't believe him
if he tells you he loves you.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.500
damn it, i miss that
one-eyed son of a bitch.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.830
oh, oh, and if you have
to shower after gym class,

03:37.900 --> 03:40.430
||
remember, there is no shame in
keeping your jockey shorts on.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.030
really?

03:42.060 --> 03:43.460
okay, there's a little sha||.||

03:45.330 --> 03:46.560
||
but the important thing is

03:46.630 --> 03:48.530
the fellows won't be calling you
"shrinky dink."

03:50.100 --> 03:51.600
shrinky dink?

03:51.660 --> 03:53.860
i'm a grower, not a shower.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.400
oh, i almost forgot.

03:58.460 --> 04:01.600
i got you a little present.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.930
||
your very own cell phone.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.230
oh, cool.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.300
the important thing to remember
is this is not a toy.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.830
it's to use
in emergencies only.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.800
emergencies? what emergencies?

04:11.860 --> 04:13.000
charlie (softly):
dad, come get me!

04:13.060 --> 04:16.660
i'm stuffed in my locker
and my underwear is wet!

04:25.630 --> 04:28.100
||
that only happened once.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.360
if that drug-sniffing dog
hadn't found you,

04:30.430 --> 04:31.830
you'd have missed thanksgiving.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.760
drug-sniffing dog?

04:34.830 --> 04:36.630
||
there were no,
there were no drugs.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.160
that's true.

04:38.230 --> 04:40.400
turns out those dogs
are also sensitive to urine.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.300
||

04:42.360 --> 04:44.630
i was in there for five hours.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.930
five hours?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.530
but you don't have
to worry about that.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.800
you have a cell phone.

04:50.860 --> 04:51.660
||

04:51.730 --> 04:53.160
which you should hide

04:53.230 --> 04:55.260
where prisoners of war
hid their watches.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.300
where was that?

04:57.360 --> 04:59.260
moving on.

04:59.330 --> 05:00.700
i've pre-programmed the phone.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.400
speed dial one is me,

05:02.460 --> 05:03.600
speed dial two is
the nurse's office,

05:03.660 --> 05:05.300
and speed dial three
is the police.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.330
||
||    the police? what for?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.500
you'll know it when it happens.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.160
now, about race riots.

05:11.230 --> 05:12.830
try not to take sides.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.330
if anybody asks, you're mulatto.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.000

alan:
how do they feel?

05:46.200 --> 05:47.700
okay, but they're ugly.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.460
they look like
old people shoes.

05:49.530 --> 05:51.200
they're not old people shoes.

05:51.260 --> 05:52.630
they're walking shoes.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.360
right, for people
who've been walking

05:54.430 --> 05:56.300
||   over 85 years.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.730
i'd rather get these.
these are cool.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.500
listen, jake,
junior high is not about

06:00.560 --> 06:02.530
being cool or popular.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.130
it's about not getting mugged
for your sneakers.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.700
i can get mugged
for my sneakers?

06:06.760 --> 06:09.000
<i>||   not those sneakers.</i>

06:10.000 --> 06:11.700
no, not unless you go walking by

06:11.760 --> 06:14.230
an assisted living facility
in a rough neighborhood.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.930
what are you doing?

06:17.000 --> 06:21.360
huh? oh.

06:21.430 --> 06:24.700
sorry, this rash
is driving me crazy.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.900
||||i feel stupid in these.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.330
better to feel stupid
than to be

06:28.400 --> 06:29.700
tied to flagpole barefoot

06:29.760 --> 06:31.930
while upperclassmen use you
as a spittoon.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.130
i don't want to be tied
to a flagpole.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.860
you won't be.
just wear the ugly shoes

06:35.930 --> 06:37.630
and don't sit
at the wrong lunch table.

06:37.700 --> 06:38.860
wrong table?

06:38.930 --> 06:40.900
how will i know
if it's the wrong table?

06:40.960 --> 06:44.600
you'll be tied to a
flagpole, right, alan?

06:44.660 --> 06:47.900
that also only happened once.

06:48.860 --> 06:51.830
let's just check the fit.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.460
ooh, good.

06:53.530 --> 06:55.360
plenty of room
for lunch money.

06:59.930 --> 07:02.260
||     * men... *

07:02.330 --> 07:04.500
how come all my school clothes
have to beige?

07:04.560 --> 07:08.000
because beige is not the
color of any known gang.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.230
right, so instead of being
mistaken for a crip or a blood,

07:11.300 --> 07:12.660
||   you'll be mistaken
for a very large band-aid.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.660
hey, band-aidsre ouchls.

07:19.660 --> 07:21.030
||     oh, oh, excuse me,
excuse me. there's a line.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.860
yeah, i just got
a couple things.

07:22.930 --> 07:24.630
well, i can see that,

07:24.700 --> 07:26.560
but it's not really based
on quantity of items.

07:26.630 --> 07:29.460
it's more of a we-were-here-
before-you kind of deal.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.800
(sighs)

07:31.860 --> 07:33.930
you gonna make
a thing out of this?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.730
there's no thing.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.130
i'm just, uh,
just playing by the rules

07:39.200 --> 07:41.360
and wouldn't it be nice
if everybody did the same?

07:41.430 --> 07:43.160
hang onto this, slick.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.830
now, you want to explain
those rules again, jughead?

07:49.100 --> 07:50.800
you know what?

07:50.860 --> 07:52.660
if you're in such a big hurry,
why don't you just go ahead?

07:52.730 --> 07:54.430
thank you.

07:56.730 --> 07:58.530
what the hell are you doing?

08:00.630 --> 08:02.160
nothing. here.

08:05.930 --> 08:07.500
(clucking)

08:07.560 --> 08:09.530
no, no, not chicken,
just good common sense.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.500
fighting accomplishes nothing.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.400
oh, i didn't know
you were so french.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.100
hey.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.100
oh, hey, julie.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.930
uh...

08:19.000 --> 08:20.960
how do you know my wife?

08:21.030 --> 08:22.960
what? oh, no, no, no.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.300
<i>i-i-i don't know her.</i>

08:24.360 --> 08:26.300
you said, "hey, julie."

08:26.360 --> 08:29.560
n-no, no. i-i-i sneezed.

08:29.630 --> 08:32.230
ay... chooie!

08:34.159 --> 08:35.460
<i>gesundheit.</i>

08:35.530 --> 08:36.530
thank you.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.000
oh, look, another
cashier opened up.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.830
(softly):
let's go, let's go, let's go.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.929
(clucking to tune
of "la marseilles")

08:46.800 --> 08:49.260
but mom said i could wait
for the bus by myself.

08:49.330 --> 08:50.800
i know.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.030
i would really rather wait
for the bus by myself.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.230
i just want to make sure
you get off okay.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.900
yeah, but being walked
to the bus stop

08:56.960 --> 08:58.230
by my dad and my uncle?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.500
i'm gonna look so lame.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.860
jake, buddy, that
ship has sailed.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.430
(indistinct chatter)

09:09.500 --> 09:11.760
please don't leave me.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.660
you're okay.

09:13.730 --> 09:15.800
just don't make
eye contact.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.160
okay, when the bus comes,

09:19.230 --> 09:20.700
don't take
a window seat.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.930
you don't want to be trapped
by one of these mouth-breathers

09:23.000 --> 09:24.300
and get pummeled.
pummeled?

09:24.360 --> 09:25.760
and be polite
to the bus driver.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.260
they tend to be damaged
people with short fuses.

09:28.330 --> 09:29.500
fuses?

09:29.560 --> 09:30.930
don't distract him.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.530
there's no seatbelts
on these old buses.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.400
one sharp turn,
and all you kids

09:34.460 --> 09:35.430
will be flying around
like lotto balls.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.230
balls?
(bus approaches)

09:38.400 --> 09:41.130
(kids cheering)

09:41.230 --> 09:44.500
oh, uh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wa.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.630

09:47.830 --> 09:50.430
i ne a curre picture
in case you go missing.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.960
an, you're
being ridiculous.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.560
they never find
those kids.

09:53.630 --> 09:57.100
gi me a profile.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.800
okay, now go
and make it a great day.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.430
ve fun.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.200
(kids shouting, laughing)

10:18.400 --> 10:21.860
i justope everhing
rns out l right.

10:21.930 --> 10:23.830
well, we've done
all we could.

10:23.900 --> 10:26.300
now it's up to him.
mm-hmm.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.500
* men... *

10:34.860 --> 10:36.300
* men... *

10:36.360 --> 10:39.330
okay, okay, tell the doctor
that if i was a tree,

10:39.400 --> 10:43.130
the rash is predominantly around
the mossy trunk area.

10:49.430 --> 10:51.500
but i'm starting
to see some redness

10:51.560 --> 10:54.430
on the adjacent boulders.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.300
oh, come on.
"tree? two boulders"?

10:57.360 --> 10:59.260
what part don't you understand?

10:59.330 --> 11:01.030
hey.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.300
hey. okay, just have him
call me.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.960
heard from jake?
nope.

11:06.030 --> 11:07.200
i'll call him at his mom's.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.000
see how school went.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.660
alan, does this look
infected to you?

11:10.730 --> 11:12.300
what? oh!

11:12.360 --> 11:14.560
get that away from me!

11:14.630 --> 11:16.900
i'm not asking you to tickle
it, just take a look.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.360
no, thank you.

11:18.430 --> 11:20.030
but you're a doctor.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.260
i'm a chiropractor.

11:22.330 --> 11:23.860
i work with vertebrae.

11:23.930 --> 11:25.460
and contrary to popular belief,

11:25.530 --> 11:27.330
there's not a single bone
in the penis.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.830
oh, hi, judith.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.660
uh, n-nothing.

11:32.730 --> 11:34.130
i was just talking
to charlie.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.400
hey, hey, is jake home
from school yet?

11:36.460 --> 11:37.830
no?

11:37.900 --> 11:39.000
oh, okay.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.600
well, i was just wondering
how his first day went.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.330
have him call me, okay?

11:42.400 --> 11:44.530
thanks. bye-bye.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.030
huh.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.460
i hope he didn't wander under
the bleachers during lunch hour.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.000
nah, he's smarter than that.

11:50.060 --> 11:51.860
smart?

11:51.930 --> 11:53.360
charlie, he only got
out of sixth grade

11:53.430 --> 11:55.330
because he couldn't fit
in the desks anymore.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.000
well, if you're that concerned,
just call him on his cell.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.160
good idea.

12:09.060 --> 12:14.000
(phone rings nearby)

12:16.030 --> 12:17.700
uh, jake?

12:17.760 --> 12:20.160
jake, where are you?

12:20.230 --> 12:24.400
oh, you're still on the bus.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.830
funny. i don't hear
the other kids.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.700
oh, yeah, it was a tough day.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.760
everybody's tired.

12:33.830 --> 12:35.860
no kidding.

12:36.930 --> 12:40.330
dad, this phone
is for emergencies only.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.900
why aren't you
at your mother's?

12:43.960 --> 12:47.430
i got off the bus at school, got
on another bus and came here.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.800
so you've never been
to school today?

12:49.860 --> 12:51.530
of course not!

12:51.600 --> 12:53.760
i don't want to be stuffed
in a locker, tied to a flagpole

12:53.830 --> 12:55.400
or dunked in a toilet!

12:55.460 --> 12:58.730
not dunked. dipped.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.760
and where are
your new sneakers?

13:00.830 --> 13:03.530
i sold them to the bus driver.

13:07.230 --> 13:09.960
a-ha.

13:10.030 --> 13:12.700
charlie, can i talk
to you for a minute?

13:13.800 --> 13:15.360
are those my comics?

13:15.430 --> 13:16.830
alan:
charlie!

13:18.600 --> 13:20.930
they're near mint, and he wipes
his boogers all over them.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.560
he was here all day,
and you didn't know?

13:23.630 --> 13:26.400
hey, i've got a rash.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.860
i can't believe he cut
school on his first day.

13:30.930 --> 13:33.160
well, when you think about it,
it's pretty smart.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.730
as far as the school
is concerned,

13:34.800 --> 13:36.560
he might just be a typo.

13:36.630 --> 13:39.730
charlie, the question is,
why did he cut school?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.160
oh, that's easy.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.100
he cut 'cause you scared the
crap out of him

13:43.160 --> 13:44.730
and dressed him
like an ace bandage.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.960
i was just trying
to prepare him.

13:47.030 --> 13:49.200
for what?
a life of running and hiding?

13:49.260 --> 13:51.560
no, no.
a life of blending in,

13:51.630 --> 13:53.130
and only if they see you,
running and hiding.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.230
face it, alan,
when the good lord

13:56.300 --> 13:58.560
was handing out courage,
you were crouched in a locker

13:58.630 --> 14:00.130
peeing on your gym socks.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.200
okay, first of all,

14:03.260 --> 14:06.960
i had had three
mr. pibbs at lunch.

14:07.030 --> 14:09.100
and secondly, i
am not a coward.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.930
come on,
i've seen steelier nerves

14:11.000 --> 14:13.230
from a cat
on the freeway.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.400
that's ridiculous.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.430
(yells)
(screams)

14:18.500 --> 14:20.260
okay, i was not ready,
and that was not fair.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.030
and-and what about you?

14:22.100 --> 14:23.830
what about me?

14:23.900 --> 14:25.160
you're afraid of everything.

14:25.230 --> 14:25.900
like what?

14:25.960 --> 14:28.030
well, let's see.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.060
germs, change, commitment,
opening your eyes under water,

14:30.130 --> 14:31.600
angry husbands,
angry ex-girlfriends,

14:31.660 --> 14:33.530
large birds, spiders and mom.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.630
hold on.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.500
hold on a sec.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.100
i am not afraid to open
my eyes under water.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.830
i'm just sensitive
to chlorine.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.130
right.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.730
and for the record, it's just
when birds get indoors.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.800
in the sky,
i got no problem.

14:47.860 --> 14:50.460
fine, fine.
live in denial.

14:50.530 --> 14:52.760
i'm gonna try
and straighten my kid out.

14:52.830 --> 14:57.260
and what sane person
is not afraid of spiders?

14:57.330 --> 15:00.360
* men... *

15:00.430 --> 15:02.330
what i'm trying
to say is

15:02.400 --> 15:03.860
that it was wrong
to fill your head

15:03.930 --> 15:06.060
with a lot of horrible
things to avoid at school.

15:06.130 --> 15:08.500
'cause the truth is,
you can't avoid any of them.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.060
charlie...

15:10.130 --> 15:11.560
you don't want him living
his life in fear, right?

15:11.630 --> 15:12.460
well, yeah, but...

15:12.530 --> 15:14.130
well, scary things
happen in life.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.560
and he can either hide
from them like you...

15:16.630 --> 15:17.600
like us.
don't nitpick.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.200
or you can
stand up to them.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.530
i mean, look, getting hit
in the face hurts,

15:23.600 --> 15:24.900
but you know
what hurts more?

15:24.960 --> 15:26.860
a kick in the crotch?

15:29.800 --> 15:31.930
well, yeah, sure.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.800
i took a soccer ball
to the nads once.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.400
thought my eyes
were gonna pop out.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.530
yeah, but that pain
passes.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.260
what hurts more and lasts
longer than anything

15:47.330 --> 15:49.360
is the humiliation
of running away.

15:49.430 --> 15:52.830
couldn't ride my bike
for a week.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.200
jake, jake, i think
you're missing the point.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.700
makes you wonder
what they're doing

15:56.760 --> 15:59.360
hanging down there
in the first place.

15:59.430 --> 16:02.660
now, what i think uncle
charlie is trying to say

16:02.730 --> 16:05.130
is that, yeah,
you might get hit,

16:05.200 --> 16:06.660
you might get
stuffed in a locker,

16:06.730 --> 16:07.630
but you know what?

16:07.700 --> 16:08.960
you'll survive.

16:09.030 --> 16:11.100
you may get bruised,
you may bleed,

16:11.160 --> 16:12.500
you may lose a few teeth,

16:12.560 --> 16:15.560
but... you'll have
your self-respect.

16:15.630 --> 16:17.300
exactly.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.830
how do you stop being afraid?

16:20.830 --> 16:23.030
well, i drink.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.730
but i didn't start
till ninth grade.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.600
* men... *

16:40.660 --> 16:44.230
yeah, judith, he
was at charlie's
the whe time.

16:44.300 --> 16:48.160
wellhe said  was too scared
to go to school.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.560
how should i know
why he's so scared?

16:53.630 --> 16:57.160
maybe you're overprotective.

16:57.230 --> 16:57.930
(softly):
good one.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.130
i-i know you mean well.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.599
all right, we'll be
there in a few minutes.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.460
okay. e-bye.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.660
did you hear that?

17:07.730 --> 17:09.099
ah, it's mom's fault.

17:09.130 --> 17:12.060
taboy.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.460
come on. it's green.

17:16.530 --> 17:17.599
let's go.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.700
(chuckles)

17:20.800 --> 17:22.460
what's the matter
with thiguy?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.960
(honks horn longer)

17:24.030 --> 17:25.700
(mouthing)

17:25.760 --> 17:27.300
(car door closes)

17:27.359 --> 17:29.630
looks like he's coming
to tell you.

17:31.860 --> 17:33.530
lock your doors!
lock your doors!

17:35.330 --> 17:36.730
wait, wait,
no, no, wait.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.600
i am tired of running
and hiding.

17:38.660 --> 17:40.330
are you tired of running
and hiding?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.060
yes, i am.

17:41.130 --> 17:42.800
remember, jake,

17:42.860 --> 17:45.230
courage is not the
absence of fear.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.000
it's taking action
despite fear.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.760
that's very true.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.430
let's do this.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.700
right behind you.

18:02.930 --> 18:05.200
two against one
wouldn't be fair.

18:05.260 --> 18:06.660
(alan screaming)

18:06.730 --> 18:08.530
(thud)

18:08.600 --> 18:10.200
<i>now, that's courage.</i>

18:10.260 --> 18:11.730
aren't you proud of him?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.360
(alan screaming)

18:13.430 --> 18:15.560
you got your cell phone?

18:15.630 --> 18:17.160
it's only for
emergencies.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.230
(shouting)

18:19.200 --> 18:20.600
help me.

18:20.660 --> 18:22.460
(fingers squeaking across glass)

18:22.530 --> 18:25.030
i think this qualifies.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.330
(alan screaming)

18:26.400 --> 18:29.330
charlie, charlie, charlie
charlie, charlie!

18:29.400 --> 18:32.130
(cell phone ringing nearby)

18:33.500 --> 18:35.300
hello?

18:35.360 --> 18:36.900
uh...

18:36.960 --> 18:39.130
(alan screaming)

18:39.230 --> 18:41.300
help me, chaie!

18:41.360 --> 18:43.230
* men... *

18:49.960 --> 18:53.000
you are a bad brother.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.160
i really thought
you had him.

18:55.230 --> 18:58.300
okay, mr. harper,
try not to sneeze.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.660
you'll blow those
stitches right out.

18:59.730 --> 19:01.100
thank you, doctor.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.430
hey, doc?

19:02.500 --> 19:05.000
while i got you here,
let me show you something.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.760
oh my goodness, your little
jimmy is all crimson.

19:09.830 --> 19:12.560
yeah. what do you think?

19:12.630 --> 19:15.560
well, it, uh, looks like
an allergic reaction.

19:15.630 --> 19:18.330
have you been applying
anything to your
genital region?

19:18.400 --> 19:20.560
just the usual--
waitresses and actresses.

19:20.630 --> 19:22.100
oh wait, wait.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.730
does grecian formula count?

19:23.800 --> 19:25.500
grecian formula?

19:25.560 --> 19:27.460
you tried to get the gray
out of your pubic hair?

19:27.530 --> 19:30.660
well, i wanted to leave a little
silver around the sides.

19:30.730 --> 19:32.100
you know, look
distinguished.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.900
doctor:
distinguished? hmm.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.830
that's interesting.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.830
we have a saying
in my country.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.560
"you can put a
tuxedo on a goat,

19:40.630 --> 19:43.760
but it is still a goat."

19:43.830 --> 19:46.030
yeah, well, we have a saying
in my country, too.

19:46.100 --> 19:49.030
"help me, my balls are on fire."

19:49.100 --> 19:52.130
okay, i'll get
you some salve.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.300
how about that?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.700
allergic reaction,
nothing to be scared of.

20:00.830 --> 20:03.300
all's well that
ends well, right?

20:04.960 --> 20:06.660
what'd they give
you for the pain?

20:06.730 --> 20:07.800
ah, you lucky bastard.
