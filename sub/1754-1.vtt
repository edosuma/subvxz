<i>People will say I am a
monster for what I've done.</i>

01:57.575 --> 01:59.443
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

02:01.579 --> 02:03.788
<i>I always thought
that I'd have more...</i>

02:03.789 --> 02:06.207
<i>- time.
- Dad?</i>

02:06.208 --> 02:07.834
Dad!

02:07.835 --> 02:09.235
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

02:10.588 --> 02:12.114
Peter?

02:26.354 --> 02:29.230
<i>He likes to sleep with
the light on at night.</i>

02:29.231 --> 02:31.133
Mary, we have to go.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.059
Dad.

02:38.991 --> 02:40.517
Be good.

02:49.877 --> 02:52.905
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

02:54.131 --> 02:56.966
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

02:56.967 --> 02:58.994
Just in case we...

03:00.763 --> 03:02.347
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.016
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

03:05.017 --> 03:07.044
Mary, we've been through this.

03:07.728 --> 03:10.096
Our life as we know it is over.

03:10.272 --> 03:13.892
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

03:14.318 --> 03:17.062
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.905
He's just a little boy.

03:18.906 --> 03:21.149
I know, I know.
But it's gonna be okay.

03:23.285 --> 03:24.686
It's gonna be all right.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.261
No rest for the weary, huh?

03:41.262 --> 03:43.630
No, I'm afraid not.

03:44.014 --> 03:45.724
Occupational hazard, I guess.

03:47.351 --> 03:48.923
What is it you're working on?

03:52.356 --> 03:55.726
Uh, just planning ahead. Do you
think I could speak with the pilot?

03:56.402 --> 03:57.849
Something you need?

03:59.029 --> 04:00.146
Perhaps I can help.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.866
I'd just like to radio ahead
and make sure everything's in order

04:02.867 --> 04:04.439
for when we land.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.496
I think we both know

04:08.497 --> 04:10.194
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.848
Richard.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.251
- They say you're a genius.
- Richard!

04:30.728 --> 04:31.770
Not if you thought
you could escape.

04:31.771 --> 04:32.562
Richard!

04:34.023 --> 04:35.049
Mary!

04:49.288 --> 04:50.814
Mary!

05:01.759 --> 05:02.801
Mare.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.546
It's okay. It's okay.
That's okay. It's okay.

05:06.138 --> 05:08.848
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

05:08.849 --> 05:10.433
Just gonna make you safe.

05:10.434 --> 05:13.303
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

05:14.522 --> 05:16.022
- Roosevelt.
- What?

05:16.023 --> 05:17.515
Roosevelt.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.827
- It's back up. It's back up.
- Oh...

05:28.828 --> 05:31.697
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.957
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

07:26.862 --> 07:28.730
Whoo!

07:31.450 --> 07:33.352
Ow!

07:36.413 --> 07:38.781
Yee-hee! Hoo-hoo!

07:44.421 --> 07:46.506
What do you got for me today,
New York?

07:46.507 --> 07:48.675
<i>Reporting live from
New York 1 chopper.</i>

07:48.676 --> 07:52.136
<i>An Oscorp truck carrying
plutonium has been hijacked.</i>

07:52.137 --> 07:54.180
<i>A police chase is in progress.</i>

07:54.181 --> 07:55.958
All right. Let's get to work.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.981
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

08:32.510 --> 08:34.511
Spider-Man!

08:34.513 --> 08:36.381
Hello, pedestrians.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.227
Knock, knock.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.232
Mr. Criminal?

08:58.287 --> 09:01.706
Hey, my name is Spider-Man. You can call
me Web-Head, you can call me Amazing,

09:01.707 --> 09:05.361
just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it? Whoa!

09:05.502 --> 09:07.962
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

09:07.963 --> 09:10.631
- I am killer!
- Whoa, okay.

09:10.632 --> 09:13.760
<i>Warning. Plutonium-238 is
a radioactive material</i>

09:13.761 --> 09:15.754
<i>and is highly explosive.</i>

09:15.971 --> 09:19.724
Excuse me. There's more room on
the sidewalk, folks, please.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.768
- Watch it, man.
- I got blueprints here.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.216
A little help?

09:23.562 --> 09:25.589
A little help, please.

09:27.649 --> 09:30.928
You having a problem with your gun?
Let me help you out with that.

09:30.986 --> 09:32.603
Whoa. Coming through.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.940
Too much work...

09:37.201 --> 09:38.493
Oh, this is bad.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.111
- I'm gonna be right back.
- Aah!

09:43.499 --> 09:45.651
Heads up. Watch out.

09:46.794 --> 09:50.046
Whoo... Okay. Okay. There you go.

09:50.047 --> 09:53.049
- You okay? You all right?
- You're Spider-Man.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.718
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

09:55.719 --> 09:57.678
“Max"? How do you know my name?

09:57.679 --> 09:59.097
It's written on your badge.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.348
I'm a nobody.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.809
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

10:02.810 --> 10:03.726
Lick that.

10:03.727 --> 10:05.311
All right. Listen to me.

10:05.312 --> 10:06.604
- Now I need you.
- Really?

10:06.605 --> 10:08.314
- You're my eyes and ears out here.
- Okay.

10:08.315 --> 10:09.482
- All right?
- All right.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.817
I'll see you out there.

10:12.152 --> 10:15.271
<i>Warning. Violation of protocol.</i>

10:45.352 --> 10:47.049
Hands up!

10:51.608 --> 10:53.305
Get him, Spidey!

10:56.280 --> 10:58.523
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.870
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.773
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.209
Get the hell out of the way!

11:10.210 --> 11:13.963
Okay. Stop it! Stop it! Whew.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.832
Oh, come on.

11:17.384 --> 11:19.001
Hey, wait. Come back here.

11:20.512 --> 11:21.538
Heel!

11:21.889 --> 11:23.131
I got you.

11:34.193 --> 11:38.070
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit
late. I got stuck in some traffic.

11:38.071 --> 11:40.114
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

11:40.115 --> 11:41.699
<i>- I know, I'm sorry.</i>
- Where are you?

11:41.700 --> 11:43.659
<i>1st and Broadway, 2nd and
Broadway, 3rd and Broadway.</i>

11:43.660 --> 11:45.536
Five minutes. Ten tops.

11:45.537 --> 11:48.456
- Are those sirens?
<i>- No.</i>

11:48.457 --> 11:49.749
- Peter?
<i>- No.</i>

11:49.750 --> 11:51.584
- Peter?
<i>- No sirens.</i>

11:51.585 --> 11:53.328
No...

11:53.712 --> 11:55.113
<i>Peter.</i>

11:55.172 --> 11:56.756
<i>What is happening?</i>

11:56.757 --> 11:58.283
<i>Peter.</i>

11:58.383 --> 11:59.830
<i>Peter.</i>

12:04.681 --> 12:06.173
<i>Hello?</i>

12:06.808 --> 12:10.478
- Peter? Pe...
<i>- I'll be right there. Promise.</i>

12:10.479 --> 12:15.107
This year's Valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.332
Good morning, esteemed faculty,

12:31.333 --> 12:33.584
and families of my
fellow graduates.

12:33.585 --> 12:36.079
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

12:42.844 --> 12:44.095
Hello.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.763
- Hey! Get off!
- I told you.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.807
I am running a bit late.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.642
It's over, Spider.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.893
Really?!

12:50.894 --> 12:53.104
I know we all think
that we're immortal.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.981
We're supposed to feel that way.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.474
We're graduating.

12:56.858 --> 13:00.236
<i>But, like our brief four
years in high school,</i>

13:00.237 --> 13:02.738
what makes life valuable

13:02.739 --> 13:05.241
<i>is that it doesn't last forever.</i>

13:05.242 --> 13:07.940
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

13:09.204 --> 13:10.981
<i>And I know that now more than ever.</i>

13:12.291 --> 13:14.034
<i>And I say it,</i>

13:14.584 --> 13:16.782
<i>today of all days,</i>

13:16.795 --> 13:19.664
to remind us that time is luck.

13:23.885 --> 13:26.959
<i>So don't waste it
living someone else's life.</i>

13:27.556 --> 13:29.879
Make yours count for something.

13:29.891 --> 13:32.101
Fight for what matters to you.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.754
No matter what.

13:33.770 --> 13:36.389
Because even if we fall short,

13:37.024 --> 13:39.191
what better way is there to live?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.789
I'll take that. That's not yours.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.612
Huh?

14:01.590 --> 14:03.958
This is not end, Spider!

14:07.262 --> 14:09.305
Michael Oates.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.844
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

14:16.271 --> 14:18.469
Alexis Ortiz.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.430
Bo Parisi.

14:26.948 --> 14:28.520
Peter Parker.

14:28.658 --> 14:30.743
Hey, I think I know that guy.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.161
Peter Park...

14:35.582 --> 14:37.108
I'm sorry.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.304
Ha, ha. Wait, do that again.
Do that again. Oh.

14:50.305 --> 14:55.351
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.771
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.773
- I am so proud of you.
- You earned it.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.552
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

15:03.693 --> 15:06.237
I know the first thing
your Uncle Ben would say.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.488
Yeah, I know too.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.866
“You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

15:10.867 --> 15:15.204
The second thing he would say, "Don't
just follow the path, make your own trail."

15:15.205 --> 15:16.705
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

15:16.706 --> 15:18.499
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.278
- Ben told me he made it up.
- Ha-ha-ha!

15:21.461 --> 15:24.705
You really did
learn something here.

15:26.633 --> 15:30.253
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

15:31.763 --> 15:33.665
Yeah, me too.

15:34.057 --> 15:35.834
And my folks.

15:36.351 --> 15:38.799
Yeah. Yeah.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.599
- Would've been good.
- Perfect d...

15:44.025 --> 15:46.193
- All right, you can go. Go on.
- Huh?

15:46.194 --> 15:47.445
I'll be right back.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.281
- Is that your program?
- Okay, guys. Get together right now.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.159
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.994
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.164
- Okay. I'll just be over here.
- Yeah, just give me two seconds.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.999
- Don't go too far.
- It's good to see you.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.868
- All right.
- All right.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.627
Hey.

16:03.628 --> 16:06.797
Did your traffic jam
have anything to do with

16:06.798 --> 16:08.924
the Russian Mob

16:08.925 --> 16:12.052
and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

16:12.053 --> 16:14.305
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.265
- Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

16:16.266 --> 16:17.349
Okay.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.673
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

16:19.811 --> 16:21.645
Can't keep me away.

16:21.646 --> 16:23.105
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

16:23.106 --> 16:24.723
- I won't be.
- Okay.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.304
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

16:29.529 --> 16:31.614
All night? I wanna hear
it all night long.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.063
- Over and over again, all night long.
- Okay.

16:34.075 --> 16:35.826
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was pretty good.

16:35.827 --> 16:39.197
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

16:39.664 --> 16:44.991
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

16:45.086 --> 16:47.079
Hi.

16:49.549 --> 16:51.667
<i>You're gonna make enemies.</i>

16:51.801 --> 16:53.703
<i>People will get hurt.</i>

16:54.638 --> 16:57.632
<i>So I want you to promise me
something, okay?</i>

16:57.682 --> 17:01.757
Leave Gwen out of it.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.515
<i>Promise me that.</i>

17:05.690 --> 17:08.468
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

17:20.955 --> 17:23.654
Peter's outside. I'm gonna
go see if he's okay.

17:23.875 --> 17:27.619
What are you doing?
What are you?

17:29.589 --> 17:31.081
Peter.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.249
What is it?

17:36.846 --> 17:38.681
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

17:38.682 --> 17:39.974
Are you all right?

17:39.975 --> 17:41.752
I don't know what I'm doing.

17:43.728 --> 17:45.926
It's my father, isn't it?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.439
Yeah.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.733
I see him everywhere I go.

17:49.734 --> 17:54.530
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.575
- Yeah, but we've talked about this.
- I know, but, Gwen...

17:57.576 --> 17:59.853
- It's not his choice.
- Gwen.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.998
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.278
And now I'm gonna come and
eat dinner with your family.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.663
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

18:10.755 --> 18:13.007
I don't know,
what does that make you?

18:13.008 --> 18:15.786
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

18:19.889 --> 18:22.667
- I thought that it meant you loved me.
- I do love you.

18:24.477 --> 18:26.049
I love you.

18:27.105 --> 18:29.507
Then why isn't that enough?

18:29.608 --> 18:30.983
Huh?

18:30.984 --> 18:33.193
Because what if
something happens to you

18:33.194 --> 18:35.946
just like it happened to him
because of me?

18:35.947 --> 18:39.366
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- Listen. No, n...

18:39.367 --> 18:41.440
I cannot let that happen.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.162
Listen to me.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.236
You're Spider-Man...

18:46.333 --> 18:48.030
and I love that.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.379
But I love Peter Parker more.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.209
That's worth it to me.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.137
I can't lose you too.

19:00.138 --> 19:05.214
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together,

19:07.145 --> 19:09.798
who does that work out for, Peter?

19:11.483 --> 19:14.227
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

19:16.946 --> 19:18.723
Wow.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.492
You have done this to me

19:21.493 --> 19:26.080
again and again, Peter.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.734
I can't live like this.

19:30.835 --> 19:32.828
I break up with you.

19:34.839 --> 19:37.333
I break up with you.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.674
<i>Good morning, New Yorkers.</i>

20:18.675 --> 20:21.260
<i>Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.</i>

20:21.261 --> 20:22.803
<i>A few clouds to start us off...</i>

20:22.804 --> 20:26.306
<i>The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate</i>

20:26.307 --> 20:28.934
<i>over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.</i>

20:28.935 --> 20:30.185
<i>How about that Spider-Man?</i>

20:30.186 --> 20:32.813
<i>Last night on the Manhattan
Bridge, he saved a dozen lives.</i>

20:32.814 --> 20:34.807
<i>We wanna hear your calls.</i>

20:34.899 --> 20:38.235
<i>I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.</i>

20:38.236 --> 20:41.613
<i>Who do you think pays the bills for
all the damages he causes, huh?</i>

20:41.614 --> 20:42.948
<i>It's you and me, taxpayers.</i>

20:42.949 --> 20:44.896
- You make this?
- Yeah.

20:45.076 --> 20:46.869
This is a wind turbine.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.693
You made this? No way.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.365
This is amazing.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.072
It's good as new, right?

20:54.461 --> 20:56.128
I'll walk you home.

20:56.129 --> 20:58.088
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

20:58.089 --> 21:00.549
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.719
<i>I don't feel like my kids are
safe with him out there.</i>

21:03.720 --> 21:06.964
<i>Get out of the way and let
the police do their job.</i>

21:07.432 --> 21:10.851
<i>Some folks think that there might
be more than one Spider-Man.</i>

21:12.353 --> 21:13.645
<i>What do you think?</i>

21:13.646 --> 21:15.564
<i>One guy or many?</i>

21:15.565 --> 21:18.650
<i>I'd love to know who's
behind that mask.</i>

21:18.651 --> 21:19.902
Hey.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.612
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.812
<i>We have a caller on the line named Max.
He says he knows Spider-Man.</i>

21:24.949 --> 21:28.076
<i>Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.</i>

21:28.077 --> 21:30.662
<i>He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.</i>

21:30.663 --> 21:33.123
<i>He saved my life one time.</i>

21:33.124 --> 21:34.616
<i>We sort of became best friends.</i>

21:36.336 --> 21:37.711
How much?

21:37.712 --> 21:39.171
Hey, you're that spider guy.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.698
I'm Spider-Man.

21:40.715 --> 21:41.715
Huh?

21:45.178 --> 21:47.387
I'm Spider-Man.

21:47.388 --> 21:50.516
<i>This Spider-Man... He's not the
police, he's not a fireman.</i>

21:50.517 --> 21:53.716
<i>What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?</i>

22:25.385 --> 22:26.832
Peter, honey?

22:27.387 --> 22:28.846
Can I come in?

22:30.598 --> 22:31.849
No!

22:31.850 --> 22:34.298
Peter, the final
starts at 9, honey.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.478
You said you would
take my car into the shop

22:36.479 --> 22:38.188
because it keeps dying, remember?

22:38.189 --> 22:41.358
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.402
Peter, please just let me in.
All right?

22:43.403 --> 22:44.653
I'm trying to get my...

22:44.654 --> 22:48.073
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

22:48.074 --> 22:50.993
- No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
- What are you do...?

22:50.994 --> 22:52.620
Peter! For goodness sakes.

22:52.646 --> 22:56.874
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee...!

22:56.875 --> 23:00.085
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

23:00.086 --> 23:01.503
I'm just...

23:01.504 --> 23:03.406
I'm very naked right now.

23:03.631 --> 23:05.874
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.051
- It is?
- Yes.

23:08.052 --> 23:11.251
Oh, yeah, yeah, I was
cleaning the chimney.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.223
We have no chimney.

23:13.224 --> 23:14.725
What?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.435
- You're late.
- I know, I'm late.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.312
Downstairs, now.

23:18.313 --> 23:21.466
- Can you leave? Because I'm naked here.
- All right, I'm leaving.

23:22.275 --> 23:25.098
- Morning, I love you.
- I love you too. Hurry up.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.278
Whoa. Well, look who's here.

24:08.279 --> 24:09.851
Spidey.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.657
How was your morning?

24:11.658 --> 24:13.867
Aces, Max, aces.

24:13.868 --> 24:16.161
I've been out saving the world.

24:16.162 --> 24:17.704
Protecting everybody.

24:17.705 --> 24:20.858
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

24:22.543 --> 24:24.411
That's why you're here.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.421
You remembered my birthday.

24:28.549 --> 24:31.343
All the crime-fighting you've
been doing, and all of a sudden,

24:31.344 --> 24:35.248
you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to...

24:36.057 --> 24:38.300
But of course you would.

24:38.309 --> 24:40.052
Why wouldn't you visit me?

24:40.687 --> 24:42.134
We're best friends.

24:44.691 --> 24:48.318
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

24:48.319 --> 24:51.738
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

24:51.739 --> 24:53.782
I know what they say
about you in the press

24:53.783 --> 24:56.159
but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.995
Because you're amazing.

24:57.996 --> 25:01.289
Wow. That's what the press needs.

25:01.290 --> 25:04.534
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

25:04.877 --> 25:06.620
You like that, Spidey?

25:06.838 --> 25:08.714
I like it a lot, Max.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.550
Good. Because today

25:11.551 --> 25:13.343
is going to be

25:13.344 --> 25:14.745
amazing.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.507
Yeah. Circuit 39.

25:21.602 --> 25:25.230
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

25:25.231 --> 25:28.442
I just wanna know if you
can find another waitress

25:28.443 --> 25:31.028
to replace me because I start
my training rounds

25:31.029 --> 25:32.362
at the hospital.

25:32.363 --> 25:35.157
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

25:35.158 --> 25:36.700
Because he'll worry.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.327
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

25:39.328 --> 25:41.275
Uh, double shift on Thursday.

25:41.330 --> 25:43.027
Okay, bye.

25:45.084 --> 25:47.532
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

25:48.421 --> 25:51.673
- Doing a double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.

25:51.674 --> 25:54.176
Got nothing else to do.
I like the girls.

25:54.177 --> 25:57.956
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar. Heh.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.639
Mm.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.226
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the <i>Bugle</i>, so that ought to help.

26:03.227 --> 26:06.563
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

26:06.564 --> 26:08.273
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

26:08.274 --> 26:10.859
If it was 1961, he
pays me a fair wage.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.529
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

26:14.530 --> 26:16.782
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.

26:16.783 --> 26:20.535
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

26:20.536 --> 26:22.412
I understand that.
I'm in college now.

26:22.413 --> 26:25.373
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

26:25.374 --> 26:28.126
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red

26:28.127 --> 26:29.377
- so no.
- That was a mistake.

26:29.378 --> 26:32.631
Because I was washing
the American flag.

26:32.632 --> 26:35.926
- My... Can I please just...?
- No one washes a flag.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.177
I do, and I won't anymore.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.429
- This is my machine.
- Fine. It's just underwear.

26:39.430 --> 26:42.099
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.797
Back off, eat your breakfast.

26:45.561 --> 26:48.522
All right, laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.107
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.150
- Give it to me.
- I'll do it some other time.

26:53.569 --> 26:54.778
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.271
Jerk.

26:57.990 --> 26:59.391
Not gonna make it.

27:02.036 --> 27:05.064
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

27:05.623 --> 27:08.196
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.172
<i>Oscorp Industries</i>

27:14.173 --> 27:18.927
<i>is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.</i>

27:18.928 --> 27:23.431
<i>By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers,</i>

27:23.432 --> 27:27.185
<i>we are generating clean, green,

<i>to power Manhattan,

27:29.897 --> 27:32.440
<i>and eventually the world

27:32.441 --> 27:35.694
- Dillon. You're late.
- Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.779
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible

27:37.780 --> 27:39.573
for the entire city's
energy supply?

27:39.574 --> 27:41.783
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid

27:41.784 --> 27:44.161
and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that,

27:44.162 --> 27:47.065
and those power grids
were designed by me.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.487
You designed them?

27:49.250 --> 27:50.792
Sure you did.

27:50.793 --> 27:52.615
And I'm Spider-Man.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.755
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

27:55.756 --> 27:59.285
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna
rip your well-groomed head off!

28:00.011 --> 28:01.503
Now, get to work.

28:03.389 --> 28:04.890
<i>What floor, please?</i>

28:04.891 --> 28:07.510
- Seventy-four.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

28:07.643 --> 28:09.044
Oh, hold that!

28:09.187 --> 28:11.354
- Can you hold that, please?
- I got it.

28:11.355 --> 28:13.565
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.609
Most people would have
just let those close.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.485
Most people
don't notice other people.

28:17.486 --> 28:20.113
<i>- What floor, please?</i>
- Um, ahem... Sixty-three...

28:20.114 --> 28:21.948
I got it. I got it. What is it?

28:21.949 --> 28:23.396
Uh, sixty-three.

28:23.534 --> 28:25.368
<i>Sixty-three, please.</i>

28:25.369 --> 28:26.661
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- In a hurry.

28:26.662 --> 28:29.206
Thank you very much.

28:32.501 --> 28:35.170
Um... I'm Max. Max Dillon.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.755
I'm Gwen.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.954
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.411
Is it your birthday?

28:42.803 --> 28:46.473
Oh, yeah. Well, I... They... Friends
of mine made this flyer up.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.558
I'm having a birthday
party at a big club.

28:48.559 --> 28:50.268
- A lot of celebrities.
- Wow.

28:50.269 --> 28:53.563
Would love to invite you, it's
just that the guest list is closed.

28:53.564 --> 28:56.983
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

28:56.984 --> 28:58.902
- That's exciting.
<i>- ...dressed as Spider-Man</i>

28:58.903 --> 29:00.445
<i>hanging out near the blaze.</i>

29:00.446 --> 29:04.271
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

29:05.368 --> 29:07.736
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

29:07.828 --> 29:10.664
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved

29:10.665 --> 29:12.066
me.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.950
He said he needed me.

29:14.961 --> 29:17.204
That must be a good feeling.

29:17.421 --> 29:19.744
<i>Sixty-third floor.</i>

29:19.966 --> 29:22.243
Oh. It was nice to meet you, Max.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.956
Wait. She remembered my name.

29:43.781 --> 29:45.649
Welcome home.

29:56.502 --> 29:59.075
It's dark in there.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.407
Your eyes will adjust.

30:02.675 --> 30:04.577
It's better this way.

30:33.372 --> 30:34.944
Dad.

30:40.671 --> 30:44.621
This is not how I
imagined I would die.

30:45.217 --> 30:47.711
Looking at my son

30:47.720 --> 30:50.043
and seeing a stranger.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.964
You have such potential, Harry.

30:55.394 --> 30:58.730
Such fierce intelligence,

30:58.731 --> 31:00.815
and you're throwing it all away.

31:00.816 --> 31:03.218
No, you threw me away.

31:05.112 --> 31:08.641
You kicked me off to
boarding school when I was 11.

31:10.076 --> 31:12.285
On my 16th birthday,

31:12.286 --> 31:14.245
you sent me Scotch.

31:14.246 --> 31:16.623
Or one of your assistants did.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.823
I'm pretty sure
because the card read:

31:19.877 --> 31:24.422
“With compliments, Norman Osborn."

31:24.423 --> 31:27.300
I don't expect forgiveness from you

31:27.301 --> 31:29.169
anymore.

31:29.887 --> 31:32.847
I don't believe in miracles.

31:32.848 --> 31:35.809
How could you possibly understand

31:35.810 --> 31:39.854
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed

31:39.855 --> 31:42.007
for something greater?

31:42.483 --> 31:44.681
And not just for me.

31:44.735 --> 31:46.352
For you!

31:48.406 --> 31:51.559
Has your hand
started to twitch yet?

31:54.078 --> 31:57.106
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming,

31:57.665 --> 32:00.159
hiding under your skin,

32:00.292 --> 32:03.491
waiting to show itself.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.922
To show you

32:05.923 --> 32:09.092
who you really are.

32:12.596 --> 32:15.920
Retroviral hyperplasia.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.216
I never told you...

32:21.105 --> 32:23.473
that it's genetic.

32:25.067 --> 32:27.140
Our disease,

32:27.570 --> 32:30.473
the Osborn curse.

32:30.865 --> 32:33.859
And it began at your age.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.645
Let me see it.

32:38.038 --> 32:40.736
Your hand. Give it to me.

32:47.465 --> 32:52.211
The greatest inheritance
I can give you

32:52.428 --> 32:54.179
isn't merely money.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.581
It's this.

32:56.307 --> 32:59.601
The sum total of all my work.

32:59.602 --> 33:03.973
Everything I did to stay alive.

33:03.981 --> 33:06.649
Maybe you can succeed

33:06.650 --> 33:08.927
where I failed.

33:31.800 --> 33:36.971
<i>Norman Osborn, the legendary founder
and CEO of Oscorp Industries, has died,</i>

33:36.972 --> 33:38.890
<i>the Osborn estate has confirmed.</i>

33:38.891 --> 33:41.434
<i>He is survived by his
only son, Harry Osborn</i>

33:41.435 --> 33:44.521
<i>who is the sole heir of the
Oscorp corporate empire.</i>

33:44.522 --> 33:45.980
Harry.

33:45.981 --> 33:49.601
<i>Osborn changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing</i>

33:49.735 --> 33:52.153
<i>and affected
the lives of millions.</i>

33:52.154 --> 33:56.783
<i>I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:</i>

33:56.784 --> 33:59.619
<i>"We can do better.
And we should do better."</i>

33:59.620 --> 34:05.124
<i>Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."</i>

34:05.125 --> 34:08.027
<i>But change isn't just a slogan.</i>

34:08.295 --> 34:10.004
<i>It begins with hard work.</i>

34:10.005 --> 34:13.830
<i>Change begins with
persistence and commitment.</i>

34:14.009 --> 34:17.428
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

34:17.429 --> 34:22.083
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

34:22.141 --> 34:23.393
But not today.

34:24.603 --> 34:25.978
Today is for mourning.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.356
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Gwen Stacy?</i>

34:28.357 --> 34:29.732
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

34:29.733 --> 34:33.777
<i>I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.</i>

34:38.284 --> 34:41.159
- Whoa. Dillon. You stay here.
- What?

34:41.161 --> 34:44.121
There's a current flow problem in
the lab. Why don't you take a look?

34:44.123 --> 34:47.150
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

34:47.585 --> 34:49.543
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.322
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.047
Happy birthday.

34:59.096 --> 35:03.296
<i>The generation of electricity by
living organisms to fend off...</i>

35:03.392 --> 35:05.435
Let's see what's going
on with you. Hey, guys.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.644
<i>The genetically manipulated...</i>

35:06.645 --> 35:08.922
At least somebody's partying.

35:09.106 --> 35:11.759
All right. Just a little sick.

35:12.318 --> 35:15.346
Mm-hm. I got your medicine, though.

35:15.904 --> 35:19.866
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.159
Designed the grid...

35:22.369 --> 35:23.953
<i>- Warning:</i>
- I should've stretched.

35:23.954 --> 35:26.873
<i>- Malfunction in Sector 5A.</i>
- I know. Just a little indigestion.

35:26.874 --> 35:29.626
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, huh, did you, Kari?

35:29.627 --> 35:31.836
Think you can sing
“Happy Birthday" for me?

35:31.837 --> 35:34.205
I'll just have to sing it
for myself.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.548
- Gilbert?
<i>- What?</i>

35:35.549 --> 35:39.302
It's Max. Can we shut down
power on Sector 32, please?

35:39.303 --> 35:40.678
<i>Forget it. I'm out the door.</i>

35:40.679 --> 35:42.722
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.466
<i>- Sorry, Max.</i>
- Hello?

35:46.268 --> 35:50.298
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

35:50.522 --> 35:52.231
This is crazy.

<i>Have a nice day.</i>

36:54.128 --> 36:55.837
<i>Harry,</i>

36:55.838 --> 36:57.922
Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny

36:57.923 --> 37:00.341
in the wake of
Dr. Connors' recent, uh,

37:00.342 --> 37:01.676
breach of trust.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.261
You mean people are pissed off

37:03.262 --> 37:06.586
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

37:08.058 --> 37:09.934
Given that,

37:09.935 --> 37:13.604
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed

37:13.605 --> 37:16.107
to restore investor confidence.

37:16.108 --> 37:19.944
Ah. That is the Osborn way.

37:19.945 --> 37:23.865
Whatever's inconvenient around
here, just get rid of it, right?

37:23.866 --> 37:27.691
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.913
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

37:30.914 --> 37:33.066
Sure, sure. I get it.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.501
Twenty-year-old kid.

37:35.502 --> 37:37.336
Two hundred billion dollar company.

37:37.337 --> 37:39.330
What was Dad thinking?

37:39.965 --> 37:42.083
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

37:43.802 --> 37:47.597
Surely, someone must've
questioned his sanity in the end.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.975
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

37:50.976 --> 37:53.436
It would've made this
conversation a lot easier.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.135
- Harry...
- It's Mr. Osborn.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.514
We're not friends.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.229
Hi.

38:10.496 --> 38:12.990
You were his assistant, right?

38:14.958 --> 38:16.450
Mm-hm.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.952
What's your name?

38:18.212 --> 38:19.712
Felicia.

38:19.713 --> 38:21.285
Felicia.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.965
From now on,

38:22.966 --> 38:27.166
everybody at this table
works for Felicia

38:27.262 --> 38:30.962
because Felicia works for me.

38:32.226 --> 38:34.299
Would anybody like to speak up?

38:36.396 --> 38:39.925
Well, good. Then you can all
keep yourjobs a little longer.

38:40.567 --> 38:44.562
Sir, there's a Peter
Parker here to see you.

38:53.121 --> 38:55.990
Felicia, I wanna see
every file on this list.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.244
Every single one.

39:06.426 --> 39:08.294
Peter Parker.

39:09.137 --> 39:11.665
It's like seeing a ghost.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.168
Hey, Harry.

39:14.601 --> 39:16.218
Random.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.048
- What, 10 years.
- It's eight.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.641
But you're close.

39:22.401 --> 39:23.973
What's up?

39:24.319 --> 39:26.312
I saw the news, man.

39:26.572 --> 39:29.615
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...

39:29.616 --> 39:34.021
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

39:34.621 --> 39:36.773
I'm with some people.

39:39.626 --> 39:41.528
I'm in a...

39:41.670 --> 39:43.170
I'm in a meeting.

39:43.171 --> 39:45.006
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

39:45.007 --> 39:46.883
I know it's been a long time.

39:46.884 --> 39:50.052
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

39:50.053 --> 39:53.047
And you were so there for me
when my parents...

39:53.390 --> 39:56.384
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

39:56.685 --> 39:58.211
Thank you.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.303
Ah, it's good to see you, man.

40:04.109 --> 40:06.011
It's good to see you.

40:06.653 --> 40:08.805
I'm sorry about your dad.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.936
You got your braces off.

40:17.623 --> 40:21.125
Now there's nothing to
distract from your unibrow.

40:24.379 --> 40:26.201
There he is.

40:26.506 --> 40:28.925
- There he is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.052
You still blow-dry your
hair every morning?

40:31.053 --> 40:36.015
Um... You know, one of my
manservants holds the hair dryer

40:36.016 --> 40:38.059
- but I work the comb, okay?
- Ha-ha-ha.

40:38.060 --> 40:42.313
So at least I'm not
completely helpless.

40:42.314 --> 40:44.716
You're stupid.

40:50.072 --> 40:53.449
After graduation, I went
to Brazil, then Singapore.

40:53.450 --> 40:54.700
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

40:54.701 --> 40:56.744
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

40:56.745 --> 40:58.271
I saw you.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.289
What do you mean, you saw me?

41:00.290 --> 41:02.667
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

41:02.668 --> 41:04.669
You know what I'm talking about?

41:04.670 --> 41:06.587
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

41:06.588 --> 41:09.590
Dude, that whole model
thing is so exhausting.

41:09.591 --> 41:11.133
I know.

41:13.720 --> 41:16.964
What? You got a lady?

41:18.225 --> 41:20.593
Uh...

41:21.186 --> 41:23.304
That's a question.

41:23.855 --> 41:25.690
That's a question.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.343
- Unh.
- Whoa, buddy.

41:28.193 --> 41:29.936
No, I don't.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.101
Yeah.

41:32.322 --> 41:34.565
I don't know. It's, uh...

41:37.452 --> 41:39.787
I don't know. It's complicated.

41:39.788 --> 41:42.031
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

41:43.750 --> 41:46.836
Uh, what's her name? Who is she?

41:46.837 --> 41:48.337
Her name's Gwen.

41:48.338 --> 41:50.285
Gwen Stacy.

41:50.590 --> 41:53.634
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.

41:53.635 --> 41:55.344
Really? She works for me?

41:55.345 --> 41:58.931
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

42:01.309 --> 42:03.102
You know, when my
father sent me away

42:03.103 --> 42:06.382
I tried to forget
everything about this place.

42:08.150 --> 42:10.803
I guess that kind of included you.

42:13.530 --> 42:16.433
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.

42:17.951 --> 42:19.728
We both got dumped.

42:22.956 --> 42:25.734
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

42:28.920 --> 42:31.493
My dad left a briefcase.

42:31.548 --> 42:34.341
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.

42:34.342 --> 42:36.927
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

42:36.928 --> 42:39.080
How's that working out for you?

42:39.347 --> 42:41.124
Perfectly.

42:46.980 --> 42:49.508
Dude. Nice arm.

42:49.775 --> 42:52.359
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.737
<i>You could do it too if you
just strengthened up that.</i>

42:54.738 --> 42:56.355
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

42:56.490 --> 43:00.110
<i>You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.</i>

43:00.327 --> 43:02.445
<i>Giant lizards</i>

43:02.621 --> 43:04.944
and spider guys.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.710
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

43:09.711 --> 43:13.411
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

43:13.465 --> 43:17.745
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

43:18.220 --> 43:19.929
I'm so impressed.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.424
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

43:22.641 --> 43:24.141
For what?

43:24.142 --> 43:27.103
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

43:27.104 --> 43:29.730
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

43:33.652 --> 43:35.069
Who was he?

43:35.070 --> 43:38.223
Maxwell Dillon.
Electrical engineer.

43:38.657 --> 43:41.117
No associates or friends
to speak of.

43:41.118 --> 43:44.662
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.189
The guy was

43:46.456 --> 43:48.153
invisible.

43:48.416 --> 43:52.992
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

43:53.088 --> 43:55.240
We've gotta find a way
to get him out.

43:55.382 --> 43:58.509
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,

43:58.510 --> 43:59.969
our stock will crater.

43:59.970 --> 44:04.216
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

44:05.725 --> 44:08.844
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

Yeah.

46:36.084 --> 46:38.657
I was just saying that
to someone. I hate complicated.

46:47.262 --> 46:52.933
Ha, ha. If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

46:52.934 --> 46:55.102
- Some ground rules?
- Yeah, some ground rules.

46:55.103 --> 46:57.062
- Heh, heh. Heh.
- Like that.

46:57.063 --> 46:58.680
Like what?

46:59.691 --> 47:02.026
- That laugh. That laugh.
- What?

47:02.027 --> 47:03.819
That's off the table.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.863
- My laugh is off the table?
- Off the table.

47:05.864 --> 47:08.157
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

47:10.327 --> 47:12.650
That's still adorable.

47:12.996 --> 47:15.247
- That was not adorable.
- It's adorable.

47:15.248 --> 47:16.707
No, it's not adorable.

47:16.708 --> 47:19.626
- Okay. I have a ground rule. Um...
- Oh, good.

47:19.627 --> 47:21.420
- What is it?
- Uh...

47:21.421 --> 47:24.165
Don't tell me that I look amazing

47:25.008 --> 47:28.457
with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

47:28.887 --> 47:31.506
I'm really serious about that one.

47:32.432 --> 47:34.558
- Oh, no.
- What?

47:34.559 --> 47:36.643
I just figured out
the next ground rule.

47:36.644 --> 47:38.020
What?

47:38.021 --> 47:39.772
No more of this.

47:39.773 --> 47:42.024
No more of this little
nose rub that you do.

47:42.025 --> 47:43.817
- This?
- Don't think I haven't... Hey.

47:43.818 --> 47:46.779
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

47:46.780 --> 47:48.447
This is killing me.

47:48.448 --> 47:51.200
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

47:51.201 --> 47:52.853
Come on. Heh.

47:54.037 --> 47:56.860
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

48:35.370 --> 48:36.787
Um, yeah. So I did that.

48:36.788 --> 48:41.917
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

48:41.918 --> 48:44.837
- Yeah. No, I know.
- Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

48:44.838 --> 48:47.464
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

48:50.218 --> 48:52.086
How do you know that?

48:53.638 --> 48:56.962
- Hm?
- How do you know I love it there?

48:57.434 --> 48:58.926
Because, um...

49:00.979 --> 49:02.801
Because you told me.

49:05.733 --> 49:08.101
It just opened last month.

49:11.531 --> 49:13.683
Have you been following me?

49:18.872 --> 49:20.524
I knew it.

49:20.748 --> 49:22.400
How often?

49:25.712 --> 49:27.337
Just once a day.

49:27.338 --> 49:29.081
Sometimes.

49:30.967 --> 49:33.165
Sometimes more.

49:37.265 --> 49:39.266
Oh, boy.

49:39.267 --> 49:40.793
Why?

49:44.939 --> 49:46.886
Make sure I'm safe?

49:47.358 --> 49:49.443
- And...
- And what?

49:49.444 --> 49:53.269
And because it's the closest
I can get to still being with you.

50:05.418 --> 50:07.616
I'm moving to England.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.246
What?

50:17.555 --> 50:19.207
Yeah. Um...

50:19.224 --> 50:23.254
I have a... I'm up for a
scholarship to Oxford.

50:24.062 --> 50:27.356
In molecular medicine. And it's
between me and this other kid.

50:27.357 --> 50:29.483
There's this oral exam
that we have to do

50:29.484 --> 50:32.486
and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

50:32.487 --> 50:34.613
And... And it's... it could be him.

50:34.614 --> 50:36.657
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

50:36.658 --> 50:40.358
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

50:41.204 --> 50:43.572
- Wow.
- Yeah.

50:43.706 --> 50:45.574
And I'm really excited.

50:46.626 --> 50:48.323
That's, uh...

50:51.214 --> 50:52.911
England.

50:55.426 --> 50:57.078
What?

51:52.900 --> 51:55.360
Station, I need a 10-85.

51:55.361 --> 51:58.780

south-end corner of Duffy Square.

51:58.781 --> 52:00.741

52:00.742 --> 52:03.270

53:18.194 --> 53:21.071
- Don't do that. Please!
- It's over, freak!

53:21.072 --> 53:23.657
Wait! It's not my fault.

53:23.658 --> 53:24.825

53:35.878 --> 53:38.119

54:03.865 --> 54:06.408

- Yeah, I know it's me.

54:06.409 --> 54:07.685

54:09.203 --> 54:10.729
You don't remember me?

54:11.289 --> 54:13.111
No. Should I?

54:13.458 --> 54:17.002
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

54:17.003 --> 54:18.670
You saved me.

54:18.671 --> 54:20.589
You said you needed me.

- Yes.

Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

54:30.099 --> 54:33.143
- Uh, what's your name again?
- How could you forget me?

54:33.144 --> 54:35.812
- I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
- It's Max.

54:35.813 --> 54:37.856
- Is it "Max"?
- Yes.

54:37.857 --> 54:40.180

I feel. I got so much...

54:54.248 --> 54:55.749
I got so much anger.

54:55.750 --> 54:58.752
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

54:58.753 --> 55:00.754
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

55:00.755 --> 55:02.907
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

55:03.132 --> 55:05.592
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

55:05.593 --> 55:07.761
- I don't want them shooting me anymore.
- They won't.

55:07.762 --> 55:10.514
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

55:10.515 --> 55:14.100

No one shoots at Max!

<i>Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.</i>

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:55.621
<i>Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.</i>

01:03:55.622 --> 01:03:59.042
<i>The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.</i>

01:03:59.043 --> 01:04:03.046
<i>But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge</i>

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:05.965
<i>- the battery might explode!</i>
- Ouch!

01:04:05.966 --> 01:04:07.618
<i>Explode!</i>

01:04:07.968 --> 01:04:09.164
<i>Boom!</i>

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:13.139
<i>When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.</i>

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.515
<i>You're not invincible.</i>

01:04:14.516 --> 01:04:16.642
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

01:04:57.851 --> 01:04:59.719
- Hello.
<i>- Pete.</i>

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:01.562
<i>It's me.</i>

01:05:01.563 --> 01:05:03.556
Hey, Harry. What...?

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.347
What time is it?

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.390
<i>Uh, late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.</i>

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:11.948
<i>I need to see you.</i>

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:13.408
You all right?

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.186
<i>Not really, Pete.</i>

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:16.744
<i>I'm dying.</i>

01:05:16.745 --> 01:05:19.898
<i>But I think you can help
save my life.</i>

01:05:20.999 --> 01:05:25.336
<i>You're looking at the world's
first human-spider hybrids.</i>

01:05:25.337 --> 01:05:28.464
<i>The hope is to extract the
venom from their glands</i>

01:05:28.465 --> 01:05:31.134
<i>and turn that into a cure.</i>

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:33.970
<i>An agent that heals diseased cells.</i>

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:39.350
<i>And if I can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases</i>

01:05:39.351 --> 01:05:41.845
<i>like Alzheimer's, even cancer.</i>

01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:48.359
They never made it to human trials.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.390
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

01:05:55.242 --> 01:05:56.859
Except maybe this.

01:06:04.585 --> 01:06:06.487
Spider-Man.

01:06:07.087 --> 01:06:08.739
What about him?

01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:12.410
He was bitten by one of
those things, and it worked.

01:06:12.634 --> 01:06:16.664
I don't know how
and I don't know why,

01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:20.391
but he can do everything
else a spider can,

01:06:20.392 --> 01:06:22.894
including self-heal.

01:06:22.895 --> 01:06:24.888
I need to find him.

01:06:25.272 --> 01:06:27.265
I need his blood.

01:06:42.372 --> 01:06:44.149
You need...

01:06:44.791 --> 01:06:47.410
Spider-Man's blood?

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:53.037
It'll save my life.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.377
It may not, Har.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.803
It may not be that simple.

01:06:57.804 --> 01:06:59.805
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

01:06:59.806 --> 01:07:01.207
Connors was weak.

01:07:01.475 --> 01:07:03.559
This is me, Peter.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.054
I don't think you can
just set up a van

01:07:06.688 --> 01:07:08.064
and have him donate.

01:07:08.065 --> 01:07:13.528
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive
about people shoving needles and...

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.055
Ah, he's sensitive, okay.

01:07:15.155 --> 01:07:20.159
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is,

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.858
and I will go ask him myself.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.356
What?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.368
- You took his picture.
- So?

01:07:29.586 --> 01:07:31.462
- You know him.
- Harry.

01:07:31.463 --> 01:07:35.007
I took a picture from a long
way away. I used a long lens.

01:07:35.008 --> 01:07:36.625
I don't know him.

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:41.423
I put together what
you said at the river.

01:07:42.307 --> 01:07:45.711
- What I...
- About how he gives people hope.

01:07:47.437 --> 01:07:49.134
Come on.

01:08:02.494 --> 01:08:03.941
What in the...?

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.447
Just say yes.

01:08:16.758 --> 01:08:19.286
Don't turn your back on me!

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:23.085
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:26.212
Please.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:29.270
Peter, please.

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.048
I can't.

01:08:34.651 --> 01:08:36.098
Please.

01:08:40.532 --> 01:08:42.604
I'm gonna try

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:45.111
and find Spider-Man.

01:08:55.005 --> 01:08:56.756
Hey, what's security
doing over here?

01:08:56.756 --> 01:08:58.006
That's so weird.

01:08:58.008 --> 01:08:59.283
She's right over there.

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.176
Hey! Miss Stacy!

01:09:24.033 --> 01:09:25.283
Hi.

01:09:25.285 --> 01:09:26.868
Hi.

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:28.567
What are you doing here?

01:09:28.705 --> 01:09:30.732
- What are you doing here?
- Oh...

01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:33.697
Come here.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:42.176
She's not here.
Check another floor.

01:09:42.176 --> 01:09:43.969
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.261
You're in trouble.

01:09:45.263 --> 01:09:46.680
- Yeah.
- Who's that guy?

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:49.684
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:53.187
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:56.607
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

01:09:56.608 --> 01:09:59.819
And he loved Spider-Man, by
the way. He was, like, a fanatic.

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:03.698
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:06.147
That's actually kind of
what it's like to love you.

01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:10.287
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

01:10:10.288 --> 01:10:11.789
- My God.
- He's completely erased.

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:13.207
That's Oscorp.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.418
And what about you?
Why are you here?

01:10:15.419 --> 01:10:16.669
Harry.

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:18.538
- Osborn?
- He's dying.

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.172
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

01:10:20.173 --> 01:10:22.967
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:25.761
is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

01:10:25.762 --> 01:10:28.472
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

01:10:28.473 --> 01:10:30.671
Or something worse.

01:10:30.934 --> 01:10:32.309
I know.

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:35.179
This is the maintenance
closet, Gwen.

01:10:35.313 --> 01:10:38.441
This is the most clichéd
hiding place you could've chosen.

01:10:38.442 --> 01:10:40.651
- This is the stupidest hiding place.
- I'm sorry,

01:10:40.652 --> 01:10:44.864
I didn't take us to the
Bahamas of hiding places.

01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:49.020
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't...

01:10:58.336 --> 01:11:01.831
- You just kissed me.
- I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

01:11:02.382 --> 01:11:03.874
How'd you like it?

01:11:03.967 --> 01:11:05.551
It felt a little bit rushed.

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:08.080
I know. I know, I know.

01:11:08.263 --> 01:11:11.932
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

01:11:11.933 --> 01:11:13.058
Okay.

01:11:27.699 --> 01:11:29.742
- Ooh! God! Damn it!
- I'm so...

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:33.204
I just spilled a hot latte all over your...
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

01:11:33.205 --> 01:11:35.289
And you too? I'm sorry.

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.041
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:39.543
- Just stay right...
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:39.544 --> 01:11:40.945
Hey! Stop!

01:11:43.006 --> 01:11:44.256
- All right. On your way.
- Aah.

01:11:44.257 --> 01:11:46.910
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

01:11:51.348 --> 01:11:53.876
- Gwen Stacy. Ha, ha.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:54.434 --> 01:11:55.976
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

01:11:55.977 --> 01:11:57.720
No, it's okay.

01:11:58.146 --> 01:12:00.890
Uh, I'm... I'm Harry.

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:02.592
Yeah.

01:12:02.901 --> 01:12:06.821
- I'm an old friend of Peter's.
- Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.697
I was kind of rushing.

01:12:08.698 --> 01:12:11.367
No, I'm sorry he
never introduced us.

01:12:11.368 --> 01:12:13.862
I thought you two had broken up.

01:12:14.204 --> 01:12:15.730
Oh.

01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:18.916
Yeah. Yes, we had.

01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:20.709
And it's...

01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:22.837
- It's complicated.
- Complicated. Yeah.

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:26.298
I mean, it's Peter. Heh. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

01:12:26.299 --> 01:12:27.700
Yeah.

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:29.495
Yeah.

01:12:29.803 --> 01:12:31.671
Yeah, you're right.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.806
But that's why he needs you.

01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:36.839
Right?

01:12:38.603 --> 01:12:41.506
To help him make his choices clear.

01:12:44.943 --> 01:12:46.193
Nice to meet you, Harry.

01:12:46.194 --> 01:12:49.598
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:48.540
You've been in a terrible accident.

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:51.792
I'm Dr. Kafka.

01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:54.345
I'm here to help you.

01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:56.339
Course you are, doc.

01:13:56.973 --> 01:14:01.469
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.047
High-intensity capacitors.

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:06.508
The kind they make at Oscorp.

01:14:06.691 --> 01:14:09.526
All of this because you're
trying to help me.

01:14:09.527 --> 01:14:11.070
You are correct.

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:13.280
I'm here to study you.

01:14:13.281 --> 01:14:18.202
To understand what you are,
why you are.

01:14:18.203 --> 01:14:20.480
<i>Und</i> I will get results.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.919
I always do.

01:14:29.756 --> 01:14:31.874
You do realize

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:34.290
you locked me in a prison

01:14:34.427 --> 01:14:36.124
that runs

01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:38.138
on electricity?

01:14:40.141 --> 01:14:43.227
Mm. I can feel it in the walls.

01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:45.505
I can feel it in my veins.

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:49.055
No matter what you do,
doc, you can't contain it.

01:14:50.151 --> 01:14:51.643
It's a force of nature.

01:14:52.904 --> 01:14:54.305
Like me.

01:15:01.371 --> 01:15:03.247
You wanna know how powerful I am?

01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:05.624
Well, so do I.

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:06.917
Ooh!

01:15:10.797 --> 01:15:13.575
I'm dying to know,

01:15:13.883 --> 01:15:15.409
doc.

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:19.013
But you better make damn
sure you kill me this time.

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:20.916
Because if you don't,

01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:23.559
I'm gonna kill the light.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.306
<i>So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.</i>

01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:30.858
<i>A world without power.</i>

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:33.637
A world without mercy.

01:15:33.653 --> 01:15:35.279
A world

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.307
without Spider-Man.

01:15:37.407 --> 01:15:42.108
And everyone will be able to
see me for who I truly am.

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:44.772
And who are you?

01:15:44.914 --> 01:15:46.782
Don't you know?

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.659
I'm Electro.

01:15:53.631 --> 01:15:57.051
<i>Warning: Electrical
restraint capacity reached.</i>

01:15:57.052 --> 01:16:00.054
<i>Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.</i>

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:02.082
Very impressive,

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:04.713
Electro.

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.337
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:19.948
Aunt May?

01:16:19.949 --> 01:16:21.566
Aunt May?

01:16:26.623 --> 01:16:28.320
What are you doing?

01:16:28.374 --> 01:16:30.196
When did you do this?

01:16:39.302 --> 01:16:42.179
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.584
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

01:16:45.809 --> 01:16:48.977
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

01:16:48.978 --> 01:16:51.063
- I don't lie.
- I know you love me, but you do.

01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:52.841
Aunt May, Aunt May.

01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:55.639
You have to tell me, May.

01:16:56.236 --> 01:16:57.694
That's my father.

01:16:57.695 --> 01:16:59.363
Yes, he was your father.

01:16:59.364 --> 01:17:02.392
But that didn't seem to
stop him from leaving you...

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.272
here.

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:07.405
I need the truth.

01:17:09.457 --> 01:17:12.042
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

01:17:12.043 --> 01:17:14.044
You were this little boy
whose whole world

01:17:14.045 --> 01:17:17.005
was turned upside down
with no explanation.

01:17:17.006 --> 01:17:22.162
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

01:17:22.303 --> 01:17:25.848
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

01:17:25.849 --> 01:17:27.432
Your father?

01:17:27.433 --> 01:17:28.767
No.

01:17:28.768 --> 01:17:33.147
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth,

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:36.191
and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

01:17:36.192 --> 01:17:41.029
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet,

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:42.906
who has to take nursing classes

01:17:42.907 --> 01:17:46.034
with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

01:17:46.035 --> 01:17:48.370
And I don't know how
to do this without Ben.

01:17:48.371 --> 01:17:49.897
I don't know how. And...

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.709
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father,

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:56.784
who was never here. No.

01:17:57.547 --> 01:17:59.381
No, I won't tell you.

01:17:59.382 --> 01:18:00.716
You're my boy.

01:18:00.717 --> 01:18:03.302
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

01:18:03.303 --> 01:18:04.795
And I won't hurt you.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:16.140
I'm your boy.

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.138
You're my everything.

01:18:19.068 --> 01:18:22.696
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

01:18:22.697 --> 01:18:25.520
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

01:18:26.242 --> 01:18:29.395
- I love you so much.
- I know.

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.618
It's okay.

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:38.078
It's okay.

01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:42.204
May.

01:18:44.928 --> 01:18:47.501
I need to know.

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.343
All right.

01:18:56.564 --> 01:18:58.807
I'll tell you everything I know.

01:19:01.402 --> 01:19:03.270
But it will hurt you.

01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:05.473
Okay.

01:19:07.784 --> 01:19:10.452
A few days after the funeral,

01:19:10.453 --> 01:19:14.608
two government men came to see us.

01:19:16.292 --> 01:19:19.419
<i>They said the genetics research</i>

01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:23.131
<i>that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable,</i>

01:19:23.132 --> 01:19:26.009
<i>and that people
would pay a lot for it.</i>

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:28.262
<i>And that's why he ran off with it.</i>

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:30.222
<i>They said he was a traitor.</i>

01:19:30.223 --> 01:19:32.307
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

01:19:32.308 --> 01:19:35.519
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us,

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.263
for the money.

01:19:38.147 --> 01:19:39.639
I don't...

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:44.319
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:48.198
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

01:19:48.199 --> 01:19:49.700
It doesn't make any sense.

01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:51.318
Peter, I don't know.

01:19:51.327 --> 01:19:54.621
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

01:19:54.622 --> 01:19:57.124
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.876
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

01:19:59.877 --> 01:20:03.213
He wore the same ratty
lab coat for 20 years.

01:20:03.214 --> 01:20:06.133
He took the D train to
work at 7 every morning.

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:08.707
Came home at 6 every night.

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:11.289
I don't know.

01:20:11.431 --> 01:20:15.085
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.630
Even from the people they love.

01:20:24.527 --> 01:20:26.019
Peter.

01:20:28.906 --> 01:20:30.558
Peter.

01:20:34.203 --> 01:20:36.105
Mr. Osborn.

01:20:40.668 --> 01:20:42.285
Look up.

01:20:43.087 --> 01:20:45.034
Think you're looking for me.

01:20:47.383 --> 01:20:49.956
I cannot believe my eyes.

01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:53.001
Spider-Man.

01:20:59.896 --> 01:21:02.298
Just the man I wanted to see.

01:21:04.692 --> 01:21:06.435
You, um...

01:21:07.528 --> 01:21:09.350
talked to Peter?

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:11.311
Yeah.

01:21:16.287 --> 01:21:20.612
I wanna help you, Mr.
Osborn. I really, really do.

01:21:21.292 --> 01:21:25.170
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:26.697
Excuse me?

01:21:27.256 --> 01:21:29.408
It's too dangerous.

01:21:29.759 --> 01:21:32.662
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:35.919
I'm already dying.

01:21:36.849 --> 01:21:39.518
Your blood can't make me die more.

01:21:39.519 --> 01:21:41.520
But it could do something worse.

01:21:44.023 --> 01:21:45.595
Okay.

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.819
All right, how much?

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.363
- How much what?
- How much do you want? Name it.

01:21:51.364 --> 01:21:55.575
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

01:21:55.576 --> 01:21:59.230
- I don't want your money.
- Come on. Everybody wants my money!

01:21:59.664 --> 01:22:01.065
I don't.

01:22:03.209 --> 01:22:04.781
I thought you...

01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:07.955
I thought you were
supposed to save people.

01:22:08.589 --> 01:22:12.509
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:15.053
You're... You're just gonna
let me die.

01:22:15.054 --> 01:22:18.515
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.

01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:21.339
You're trying to protect yourself.

01:22:21.477 --> 01:22:25.981
Look, we just need a bit more time

01:22:25.982 --> 01:22:28.062
- to figure out something else.
- I do not have time!

01:22:35.491 --> 01:22:36.983
I'm sorry.

01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:49.489
You're a fraud, Spider-Man! Unh!

01:23:02.685 --> 01:23:04.686
- Unh! Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:04.687 --> 01:23:07.856
- Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
- I'm running late right now.

01:23:07.857 --> 01:23:10.692
- It's just gonna take a second.
- I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

01:23:10.693 --> 01:23:14.237
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

01:23:14.238 --> 01:23:16.448
- Everything's a mess. Everything's insane.
- Shh. Shh.

01:23:16.449 --> 01:23:18.909
My dad, my mom. Everything
I thought about them? Lies.

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:22.078
Ha! Lies. Lies, lies, lies. Nothing
makes any sense anymore.

01:23:22.079 --> 01:23:24.164
I gotta figure out what
I'm gonna do with Harry.

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:25.874
Of course I wanna
save him. You know?

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:27.751
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:30.837
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

01:23:30.838 --> 01:23:32.547
I don't know. I got no idea.

01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:37.093
- Oh, God.
- I got nothing. I got nothing.

01:23:37.094 --> 01:23:40.055
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

01:23:41.474 --> 01:23:43.046
Ms. Stacy?

01:23:43.267 --> 01:23:44.684
Shall I take you upstairs?

01:23:44.685 --> 01:23:47.312
Yes. I'm so sorry.

01:23:47.313 --> 01:23:51.733
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

01:23:51.734 --> 01:23:53.932
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

01:23:54.987 --> 01:23:57.197
- I'm... Ahem. Okay. I have to be...
- Where are we?

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.975
I'm at my...

01:23:59.325 --> 01:24:02.399
last interview for
Oxford right now.

01:24:03.454 --> 01:24:05.580
- Oxford. I didn't know.
- Yeah.

01:24:05.581 --> 01:24:08.041
Oh. Okay, well...

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:10.794
I'm sorry to bother you, uh,

01:24:10.795 --> 01:24:12.629
my fair lady... Madam.

01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:14.631
But who am I?

01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:16.424
I mean, who am I?
I'm John Hopkins.

01:24:16.425 --> 01:24:18.718
I'm one of the young
professors at Harvard,

01:24:18.719 --> 01:24:22.089
and I've been trying to
get her to be in my...

01:24:22.348 --> 01:24:24.891
Be a part of my team
for a while now.

01:24:24.892 --> 01:24:28.061
And she's just the best person
I know and a scientific genius.

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:29.312
And...

01:24:29.313 --> 01:24:30.981
Anyway, God save the queen.

01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:33.024
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Can you wait?

01:24:33.025 --> 01:24:34.776
Peter. Peter.

01:24:34.777 --> 01:24:36.770
What do you want to say to me?

01:24:37.196 --> 01:24:39.064
What's the "one thing"?

01:24:42.743 --> 01:24:44.986
I have to go to England, Peter.

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.358
It's important to me.

01:24:52.336 --> 01:24:56.366
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

01:24:56.632 --> 01:24:58.967
You know? I don't know.

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:00.711
Maybe we're just

01:25:00.845 --> 01:25:02.596
going different ways. I don't...

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:05.091
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:09.219
Gwen.

01:25:11.939 --> 01:25:13.511
Good luck.

01:25:16.652 --> 01:25:19.154
Hi. Sorry.

01:26:22.968 --> 01:26:25.917

01:26:58.337 --> 01:27:00.034
Mr. Osborn?

01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:02.757
You all right?

01:27:02.758 --> 01:27:05.510
Is there anything I can get you?

01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:08.915
No, not unless you can bring
those spiders back to life.

01:27:09.181 --> 01:27:10.473
Spiders?

01:27:10.474 --> 01:27:12.842
The ones that they destroyed...

01:27:13.602 --> 01:27:17.176
"to restore investor confidence."

01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:20.233
Go home, Felicia.

01:27:20.234 --> 01:27:21.931
Take the day off.

01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:25.313
Harry.

01:27:27.032 --> 01:27:31.232
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

01:27:33.122 --> 01:27:37.868
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

01:27:38.544 --> 01:27:40.742
Before they destroyed the spiders,

01:27:41.297 --> 01:27:43.324
they had the venom extracted.

01:27:43.924 --> 01:27:47.123
Uh, what?

01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:50.680
What are you saying?

01:27:50.681 --> 01:27:52.766
That way, they could
comply with the lawsuits,

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:56.011
but still keep the data in
case it ever became useful.

01:27:56.979 --> 01:27:58.354
Where is it?

01:27:58.355 --> 01:28:00.553
It's somewhere in the building.

01:28:01.650 --> 01:28:05.487
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

What did you do?

01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:00.458
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

01:29:00.459 --> 01:29:04.754
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

01:29:04.755 --> 01:29:09.384
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

01:29:09.385 --> 01:29:13.429
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:15.598
You are experimenting
on people in there.

01:29:15.599 --> 01:29:18.017
Progress has its stepping stones.

01:29:18.018 --> 01:29:21.062
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

01:29:21.063 --> 01:29:22.897
How do I put this gently?

01:29:22.898 --> 01:29:24.299
fired.

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:27.527
You are not going to bury me too.

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:30.602
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:33.017
It's only a matter of time.

01:29:33.284 --> 01:29:35.869
You're going to die
a horrible death.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.943
Like your father.

01:29:38.205 --> 01:29:40.152
The difference is,

01:29:40.207 --> 01:29:42.484
no one is going to miss you.

01:29:45.129 --> 01:29:46.379
Get him out.

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.781
Wait. Wait.

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.795
I know my way out.

01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:08.902
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.321
Tell you why, you should put
the lid on that but quick.

01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:12.906
I tried. Good luck.

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:16.106
You should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators.

01:32:39.928 --> 01:32:41.545
<i>Test.</i>

01:32:41.764 --> 01:32:43.882
<i>My name is Richard Parker.</i>

01:32:44.308 --> 01:32:46.059
<i>Whatever lies will
be told about me,</i>

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.337
<i>I would like the world
to know the truth.</i>

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:52.398
<i>Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research</i>

01:32:52.399 --> 01:32:57.487
<i>when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization</i>

01:32:57.488 --> 01:33:00.239
<i>to continue funding my research.</i>

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:02.950
<i>And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.</i>

01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:05.661
<i>Weapons. Biological
weapons, of course.</i>

01:33:05.662 --> 01:33:07.246
<i>So I refused.</i>

01:33:07.247 --> 01:33:10.625
<i>And now, to eliminate
me from the picture,</i>

01:33:10.626 --> 01:33:14.754
<i>Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me</i>

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:18.659
<i>in order to take
control of my work.</i>

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:23.387
Can I help you?

01:33:23.388 --> 01:33:25.807
Uh, yeah, you can open the gate.

01:33:25.808 --> 01:33:27.350
I'm Harry Osborn.

01:33:27.351 --> 01:33:31.604
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:34.732
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

01:33:34.733 --> 01:33:37.727
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

01:33:41.031 --> 01:33:43.854
<i>But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...</i>

01:33:44.493 --> 01:33:46.691
<i>that Norman doesn't know.</i>

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:49.906
<i>The human DNA</i>

01:33:50.082 --> 01:33:53.031
<i>that I implanted in the spiders...</i>

01:33:54.503 --> 01:33:56.029
<i>was my own.</i>

01:33:58.132 --> 01:34:00.675
<i>Which means that without me,</i>

01:34:00.676 --> 01:34:02.749
<i>without my bloodline,</i>

01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:07.632
<i>Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.</i>

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:10.268
Keep Electro incubated

01:34:10.269 --> 01:34:14.845
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental <i>und</i> phenobarbital.

01:34:15.399 --> 01:34:19.318
<i>I have destroyed as much as
possible from the archives.</i>

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:22.864
<i>But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.</i>

01:34:22.865 --> 01:34:26.325
<i>So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.</i>

01:34:26.326 --> 01:34:30.371
<i>I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.</i>

01:34:30.372 --> 01:34:32.540
<i>But as a father,</i>

01:34:32.541 --> 01:34:35.918
<i>it means I may not
see my boy again.</i>

01:34:35.919 --> 01:34:40.415
<i>And nothing is as important to me</i>

01:34:40.757 --> 01:34:43.134
<i>as my son, Peter.</i>

01:34:43.135 --> 01:34:45.287
<i>Nothing in this world.</i>

01:34:45.512 --> 01:34:47.722
<i>But I have a responsibility</i>

01:34:47.723 --> 01:34:50.016
<i>to protect the world
from what I've created,</i>

01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:53.387
<i>and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.</i>

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:56.632
<i>People will say I am a monster</i>

01:34:57.232 --> 01:34:59.225
<i>for what I've done.</i>

01:35:00.527 --> 01:35:02.429
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

01:35:04.781 --> 01:35:07.158
<i>I always thought that I'd have more</i>

01:35:07.159 --> 01:35:08.492
<i>time.</i>

01:35:08.493 --> 01:35:10.620
<i>Dad? Dad!</i>

01:35:10.621 --> 01:35:12.318
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:35:30.849 --> 01:35:32.842
<i>Sedation off.</i>

01:35:33.977 --> 01:35:35.424
<i>Psst.</i>

01:35:39.358 --> 01:35:41.760
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:35:41.777 --> 01:35:44.179
All right? But we
don't have much time.

01:35:44.696 --> 01:35:45.947
Who are you?

01:35:45.948 --> 01:35:49.477
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

01:35:50.869 --> 01:35:52.370
I should kill you.

01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:54.489
Oh, come on.

01:35:54.581 --> 01:35:56.749
Think bigger, Max.

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:59.001
I'm not the one you want.

01:35:59.002 --> 01:36:00.544
You want Spider-Man.

01:36:01.797 --> 01:36:03.881
And I can give him to you.

01:36:03.882 --> 01:36:08.958
But I need something first.

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:12.549
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

01:36:12.599 --> 01:36:14.421
Get you in?

01:36:14.476 --> 01:36:15.810
You own it.

01:36:15.811 --> 01:36:18.437
Heh. Uh, not anymore.

01:36:18.438 --> 01:36:19.939
Oscorp betrayed us both,

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:24.186
so I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.

01:36:24.736 --> 01:36:25.653
What's happening?

01:36:25.654 --> 01:36:27.571
Someone pulled an
alarm in the lso Unit.

01:36:27.572 --> 01:36:30.521
Get a containment
team up there now.

01:36:30.784 --> 01:36:32.743
You couldn't possibly
know what I want.

01:36:32.744 --> 01:36:34.704
You submitted the
design for the grid,

01:36:34.705 --> 01:36:36.831
and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

01:36:36.832 --> 01:36:38.874
You just wanna take
back what's yours.

01:36:38.875 --> 01:36:41.836
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max,

01:36:41.837 --> 01:36:44.005
and it's right at your fingertips.

01:36:44.006 --> 01:36:46.048
And then once you
shut down the grid,

01:36:46.049 --> 01:36:50.219
Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

01:36:51.930 --> 01:36:53.377
Break it! Break it!

01:36:56.059 --> 01:36:57.893
Max, we don't have much time!

01:36:57.894 --> 01:37:00.479
Go! Go, go! Go!

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:02.773
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

01:37:02.774 --> 01:37:04.221
Because I need you!

01:37:05.736 --> 01:37:06.986
You need me?

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:10.239
Yes. I need you.

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.535
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

01:37:14.536 --> 01:37:15.703
You need me?

01:37:15.704 --> 01:37:18.027
Yes. I need you.

01:37:18.707 --> 01:37:20.279
I need you. Please! Please!

01:37:21.752 --> 01:37:23.127
Please!

01:37:23.128 --> 01:37:25.254
I know what it's like
to be thrown away!

01:37:25.255 --> 01:37:26.505
Please, Max!

01:37:26.506 --> 01:37:28.829
I need you! I need you!

01:38:18.850 --> 01:38:20.251
No!

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:25.924
You wanna be my friend?

01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:28.609
I thought we were already friends.

01:38:29.986 --> 01:38:31.808
I had a friend once.

01:38:32.489 --> 01:38:34.641
It didn't work out.

01:38:35.158 --> 01:38:36.855
Yeah. Me too.

01:38:37.953 --> 01:38:40.447
Then let's go catch a spider.

01:38:43.458 --> 01:38:46.361
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:50.453
<i>Hi, Peter, it's me.</i>

01:38:50.966 --> 01:38:54.844
<i>Uh, I got in to Oxford.</i>

01:38:54.845 --> 01:38:59.466
<i>Woo-hoo. It's very exciting.</i>

01:38:59.558 --> 01:39:03.303
<i>I came by your house
a little bit ago and I, um...</i>

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.812
<i>You weren't there,</i>

01:39:04.813 --> 01:39:08.441
<i>and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now,</i>

01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:11.360
<i>because there's this early
summer class that I found out about,</i>

01:39:11.361 --> 01:39:14.822
<i>and I thought that
it would somehow</i>

01:39:14.823 --> 01:39:19.228
<i>be easier, I guess, this way.</i>

01:39:19.411 --> 01:39:23.080
<i>I think that maybe it's time</i>

01:39:23.081 --> 01:39:25.654
<i>to let this go.</i>

01:39:25.917 --> 01:39:28.461
<i>And that's not because
I don't love you.</i>

01:39:28.462 --> 01:39:32.162
<i>It's actually because
I do, so, um...</i>

01:39:32.382 --> 01:39:34.159
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

01:39:48.273 --> 01:39:51.096
- We have to move, now.
- Why? What's happened?

01:40:03.622 --> 01:40:05.649
Remember me?

01:40:09.628 --> 01:40:11.212
Oh, my, Oh, my.

01:40:11.213 --> 01:40:13.581
How the tables have turned.

01:40:13.757 --> 01:40:16.383
I know it's hard to admit,

01:40:16.384 --> 01:40:21.130
but how spectacular a move is this?

01:40:21.973 --> 01:40:24.967
- Am I right?
- Right as rain.

01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:29.063
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother,

01:40:29.064 --> 01:40:32.107
it is time to grant me a wish.

01:40:32.108 --> 01:40:36.729
- I want in to Special...
- How dare you come back in here?

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:41.242
You recalcitrant,
unworthy, defective,

01:40:41.243 --> 01:40:43.611
urchin freaks.

01:40:45.789 --> 01:40:51.366
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

01:41:04.599 --> 01:41:06.046
Clear.

01:41:07.477 --> 01:41:10.426
Welcome back to the bonus round.

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:15.344
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

01:41:19.281 --> 01:41:22.324
The grid is all yours.

01:41:54.357 --> 01:41:57.226
The spider venom.
Give it to me.

01:42:02.824 --> 01:42:04.491
What is all this stuff?

01:42:04.492 --> 01:42:06.394
The future.

01:42:19.758 --> 01:42:21.375
Load one up.

01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:27.056
It won't work.

01:42:27.057 --> 01:42:30.976
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

01:42:30.977 --> 01:42:35.348
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

01:42:38.985 --> 01:42:41.433
Do it. Now.

01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:02.758
You had it all this time.

01:44:32.348 --> 01:44:33.974
It's Spider-Man.

01:44:39.689 --> 01:44:41.106
Stop the cab.

01:44:41.107 --> 01:44:43.555
Lady, I ain't even moving.

01:45:08.134 --> 01:45:09.330
Whoa!

01:45:13.765 --> 01:45:15.712
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:45:16.017 --> 01:45:18.018
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

01:45:18.019 --> 01:45:20.938
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

01:45:20.939 --> 01:45:22.981
- Don't do that.
- I couldn't make it out.

01:45:22.982 --> 01:45:25.510
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

01:45:26.778 --> 01:45:28.896
Because I love you.

01:45:29.531 --> 01:45:32.199
- And no offense, but you're wrong.
- I'm wrong about what?

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.284
You're wrong about us
being on different paths.

01:45:34.285 --> 01:45:37.029
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

01:45:37.705 --> 01:45:40.278
And you're always gonna be my path.

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:44.711
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

01:45:44.712 --> 01:45:46.785
But I'm tired of them.

01:45:49.008 --> 01:45:51.706
I'm tired of every
single one of them.

01:45:51.803 --> 01:45:54.126
We've all gotta make a choice.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.508
Right? Well, I choose you.

01:45:59.727 --> 01:46:01.228
So

01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:03.176
here's my thought.

01:46:04.399 --> 01:46:06.142
England.

01:46:07.068 --> 01:46:08.811
Both of us.

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.273
I'm following you now.

01:46:12.407 --> 01:46:14.650
I'm just gonna follow
you everywhere.

01:46:14.826 --> 01:46:17.194
I'm just gonna follow
you the rest of my life.

01:46:17.954 --> 01:46:21.415
I mean, they got crime
there in England.

01:46:21.416 --> 01:46:23.333
- Yeah.
- They got tons of crime, it seems.

01:46:23.334 --> 01:46:25.657
- Tons.
- They got, uh,

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.297
- Jack the Ripper.
- Heh, heh.

01:46:28.298 --> 01:46:29.548
What?

01:46:29.549 --> 01:46:32.301
They haven't caught Jack the
Ripper yet. You didn't know that?

01:46:52.155 --> 01:46:53.727
What the hell is that?

01:47:03.958 --> 01:47:05.905
Is that Max?

01:47:06.085 --> 01:47:08.738
He must have cut the
power to the whole city.

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:19.014
PNA 322, you are...

01:47:19.015 --> 01:47:21.308
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

01:47:21.309 --> 01:47:23.894
Hey, I need Tech Ops
up here right now.

01:47:23.895 --> 01:47:26.772
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:28.815
Hey, write down what
you remember, people.

01:47:28.816 --> 01:47:32.819
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:35.906
There's an emergency
reset at the power plant.

01:47:35.907 --> 01:47:38.992
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

01:47:38.993 --> 01:47:41.912
How will I stop him? Every time I get
close, he fries my web shooters.

01:47:41.913 --> 01:47:44.122
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.

01:47:44.123 --> 01:47:46.416
- Rubber, plastic...
- Did you try magnetizing them?

01:47:46.417 --> 01:47:49.127
I didn't try magnetizing them.

01:47:49.128 --> 01:47:51.701
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:54.993
If you magnetize a nail
with a battery...

01:47:55.009 --> 01:47:57.286
- It holds an electric charge.
- Yes.

01:47:59.263 --> 01:48:02.724
New York Approach. This is
Pan National 273 on approach.

01:48:02.725 --> 01:48:04.422
How do you hear?

01:48:05.019 --> 01:48:06.603
Approach, do you copy?

01:48:06.604 --> 01:48:08.972
Radio's working. It's not us.

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:20.409
Do not panic. Everyone, please
return to your vehicles.

01:48:20.410 --> 01:48:22.687
Go back to your cars.

01:48:22.745 --> 01:48:24.362
Remain calm.

01:48:25.415 --> 01:48:28.250
Do not panic. Everyone
return to your vehicles.

01:48:28.251 --> 01:48:30.119
- Go into your homes.
- Officer!

01:48:30.128 --> 01:48:31.503
- Spider-Man!
- Oh!

01:48:31.504 --> 01:48:34.006
My father was Captain George
Stacy of the 19th Precinct.

01:48:34.007 --> 01:48:37.009
- I knew who he was. What can we do?
- Jumper cables.

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:39.386
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

01:48:39.387 --> 01:48:42.210
Am I talking louder than I
usually talk right now?!

01:48:42.557 --> 01:48:44.391
- Yes.
- Ho.

01:48:44.392 --> 01:48:46.912
- Your suit'll ground you.
- All right, do it.

01:48:49.814 --> 01:48:52.941
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:48:52.942 --> 01:48:54.192
Okay, it works, good.

01:48:54.193 --> 01:48:56.111
That is why you were
number two at Midtown.

01:48:56.112 --> 01:48:57.308
- Rub it in. Okay.
- Heh.

01:48:59.365 --> 01:49:01.199
- I gotta go.
- I'm coming with you.

01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:03.285
- You're not coming with me.
- Yes, I am.

01:49:03.286 --> 01:49:04.786
- It's too dangerous.
- I'm coming.

01:49:04.787 --> 01:49:07.456
I've seen the grid specs and I
know how to reset the system.

01:49:07.457 --> 01:49:11.668
- I'm coming with you! You need me!
- Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:13.295
Shut the thing.

01:49:13.296 --> 01:49:15.380
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

01:49:16.841 --> 01:49:18.425
Peter!

01:49:18.426 --> 01:49:20.510
We still don't have
backup generators.

01:49:20.511 --> 01:49:22.262
Get me Engineering!

01:49:22.263 --> 01:49:23.680
I need a respirator right now.

01:49:23.681 --> 01:49:25.766
They're battery-operated.
I'll get it.

01:49:25.767 --> 01:49:27.339
Hang on.

01:49:27.685 --> 01:49:29.132
Okay.

01:49:51.542 --> 01:49:54.086
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

01:49:54.087 --> 01:49:57.741
<i>It's time to meet our destiny.</i>

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.148
Tower, we're experiencing some
kind of electrical disturbance.

01:50:15.149 --> 01:50:18.052
Instruments are going
haywire. Radar is down.

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:20.730
We're flying blind out
here. Do you copy?

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:27.619
Tower, repeat: We are standby
only. What is happening?

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:31.123
Sir? There are two inbound
flights on intersecting paths.

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:33.083
- Time to impact?
- Four and a half minutes.

01:50:33.084 --> 01:50:34.610
Clock it right now.

01:50:48.182 --> 01:50:50.684
You're too late, Spider-Man.

01:50:50.685 --> 01:50:52.602
I designed this power grid.

01:50:52.603 --> 01:50:54.437
Now I'm gonna take back

01:50:54.438 --> 01:50:56.523
what is rightfully mine.

01:50:56.524 --> 01:50:58.942
I will control everything.

01:50:58.943 --> 01:51:02.821
And I will be like a god to them.

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.519
A god named Sparkles?

01:51:14.458 --> 01:51:16.126
Not this time.

01:51:16.127 --> 01:51:18.245
Is that all you got?
Come on!

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:39.262
Come on!

01:51:43.112 --> 01:51:44.529
You ready to give up?

01:51:54.957 --> 01:51:57.860
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

01:52:08.179 --> 01:52:10.055
Just shake it off.
It's just your bones,

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:13.335
and your muscles
and your organs. Hunh!

01:52:15.853 --> 01:52:17.721
Oh, boy.

01:52:24.695 --> 01:52:26.096
I hate this song!

01:52:46.676 --> 01:52:48.077
Spider-Man,

01:52:48.094 --> 01:52:49.837
bet you never saw this coming.

01:52:57.103 --> 01:52:59.229
Really? You web me to a car?

01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:00.772
What are you, a caveman?

01:53:00.773 --> 01:53:02.232
You shouldn't be here.

01:53:02.233 --> 01:53:05.068
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:07.445
- What are you doing here?!
- I know the grid specs.

01:53:07.446 --> 01:53:08.989
I can reset the system!

01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:11.449
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:13.410
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

01:53:13.411 --> 01:53:16.621
Nobody makes my decisions
for me. All right? Nobody.

01:53:16.622 --> 01:53:19.070
This is my choice, okay?

01:53:19.375 --> 01:53:22.085
- My choice. This is mine.
- Oh!

01:53:22.086 --> 01:53:24.504
- Now, how do we stop him?
- Okay, so he's electric,

01:53:24.505 --> 01:53:26.214
he's like a battery.

01:53:26.215 --> 01:53:28.133
What happens if you
overcharge a battery?

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:29.384
- It explodes.
- Right.

01:53:29.385 --> 01:53:31.219
So we use his power
against him. Perfect.

01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:33.305
- Okay.
- I think I can reconnect the power lines.

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.056
But I need you to reset the system.

01:53:35.057 --> 01:53:38.143
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:40.687
- No matter what. No matter what.
- Peter.

01:53:45.484 --> 01:53:47.227
Go, go!

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:41.319
Sixty seconds to impact.

01:55:06.273 --> 01:55:07.674
Aah!

01:55:15.533 --> 01:55:16.783
Now, Gwen, now!

01:55:16.784 --> 01:55:18.310
Do it now!

01:55:43.519 --> 01:55:45.091
Uni 687...

01:55:55.823 --> 01:55:59.022
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

01:55:59.326 --> 01:56:02.579
You have incoming traffic.
I repeat: 280.

01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:04.277
<i>Defend immediately.</i>

01:56:14.592 --> 01:56:16.335
Whoo!

01:56:19.388 --> 01:56:20.789
Yes!

01:56:21.015 --> 01:56:23.475
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

01:56:23.476 --> 01:56:25.253
I'll be back in a minute.

01:56:25.394 --> 01:56:27.896
Oh, thank God. All right!

01:56:27.897 --> 01:56:30.148
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

01:57:05.935 --> 01:57:07.977
I think we can still
make your flight.

01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:18.096
Gwen, stay there.

01:57:43.764 --> 01:57:45.586
Peter.

01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:49.674
When you said Spider-Man said no,

01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:54.065
you meant you said no.

01:57:54.066 --> 01:57:56.734
Harry, what did you do?

01:57:56.735 --> 01:57:59.137
What you made me do.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:01.030
You were my friend

01:58:01.031 --> 01:58:03.866
and you betrayed me!

01:58:03.867 --> 01:58:05.393
No.

01:58:05.452 --> 01:58:07.775
- I was trying to protect you.
- Oh.

01:58:08.122 --> 01:58:09.622
Look at me.

01:58:09.623 --> 01:58:12.117
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

01:58:12.126 --> 01:58:13.778
You don't give people hope.

01:58:14.086 --> 01:58:15.878
You take it away.

01:58:15.879 --> 01:58:17.326
No, Harry.

01:58:17.506 --> 01:58:19.716
I'm gonna take away yours.

01:58:19.717 --> 01:58:21.509
- No. Gwen, run!
- Aah!

01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:23.082
Harry!

01:58:23.304 --> 01:58:24.846
Harry, put her down!

01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:43.615
Harry, stop this right now!

01:58:43.616 --> 01:58:46.735
This isn't you, Harry. This is
not you. Harry, put her down.

01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:49.078
- Harry.
- Harry is dead!

01:58:49.079 --> 01:58:52.290
Harry, this is between you
and me. You wanna fight?

01:58:52.291 --> 01:58:54.739
Fight me! Let her go!

01:58:54.877 --> 01:58:56.403
Okay.

01:58:57.212 --> 01:58:58.238
No!

01:59:06.138 --> 01:59:08.791
- You okay?
- Mm-mm.

01:59:12.853 --> 01:59:15.381
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

02:00:35.227 --> 02:00:36.549
Peter?

02:01:39.875 --> 02:01:42.494
Hey. Hey.

02:01:45.339 --> 02:01:46.786
Gwen?

02:01:49.051 --> 02:01:50.426
Hey.

02:01:50.427 --> 02:01:51.953
Hey!

02:01:56.391 --> 02:01:57.883
Gwen?

02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:00.921
Hey.

02:02:04.066 --> 02:02:05.513
Breathe.

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.975
Hey, Gwen.

02:02:09.571 --> 02:02:10.972
Hey.

02:02:14.326 --> 02:02:15.773
Hey.

02:02:17.788 --> 02:02:19.485
You're okay.

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:24.327
Gwen?

02:02:29.842 --> 02:02:31.592
Stay with me, stay with me.

02:02:31.593 --> 02:02:34.371
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

02:02:39.726 --> 02:02:41.218
Gwen.

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:44.969
Gwen!

02:02:47.568 --> 02:02:50.517
No, please, please.

02:02:52.656 --> 02:02:54.433
Please.

02:03:00.914 --> 02:03:03.567
I can't do this without you.

02:05:05.831 --> 02:05:07.653
Leave us.

02:05:11.545 --> 02:05:13.379
You've made progress.

02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:16.841
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:19.176
Now that Spider-Man's gone,

02:05:19.177 --> 02:05:22.471
this city will never be the same.

02:05:22.472 --> 02:05:25.266
Oh, I'm counting on that.

02:05:25.267 --> 02:05:27.101
Speaking of progress,

02:05:27.102 --> 02:05:28.549
you're looking better.

02:05:29.104 --> 02:05:31.347
It comes and goes.

02:05:32.649 --> 02:05:34.517
Tell me more.

02:05:34.693 --> 02:05:36.485
How many men did you have in mind?

02:05:36.486 --> 02:05:38.738
I wanna keep it small.

02:05:38.739 --> 02:05:42.366
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

02:05:44.077 --> 02:05:45.828
<i>Access granted.</i>

02:05:45.829 --> 02:05:48.039
<i>Welcome, Mr. Fiers.</i>

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:49.999
<i>Who's our first volunteer?</i>

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.043
<i>Aleksei Sytsevich.</i>

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:54.462
<i>Currently serving a life sentence.</i>

02:05:54.463 --> 02:05:55.921
<i>He is</i>

02:05:55.922 --> 02:05:58.575
<i>most eager to join us.</i>

02:05:59.009 --> 02:06:00.706
<i>Good.</i>

02:06:00.969 --> 02:06:03.371
<i>Start with him.</i>

02:06:03.472 --> 02:06:05.264
<i>Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich</i>

02:06:05.265 --> 02:06:07.433
<i>was broken out of
a classified penitentiary</i>

02:06:07.434 --> 02:06:10.853
<i>known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.</i>

02:06:10.854 --> 02:06:13.522
<i>It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity</i>

02:06:13.523 --> 02:06:16.942
<i>since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.</i>

02:06:16.943 --> 02:06:20.446
<i>The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.</i>

02:06:20.447 --> 02:06:23.282
<i>Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department</i>

02:06:23.283 --> 02:06:25.534
<i>has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping</i>

02:06:25.535 --> 02:06:27.870
<i>for the return
of the web-slinger.</i>

02:06:27.871 --> 02:06:30.444
<i>The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:</i>

02:06:30.707 --> 02:06:32.333
<i>Where is Spider-Man?</i>

02:06:34.086 --> 02:06:36.909
Oh. Too bad about that spider guy.

02:06:38.048 --> 02:06:41.327
Too bad he's disappeared. Seems
like everybody really needs him.

02:06:42.928 --> 02:06:44.625
Where you going?

02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:48.504
- Eat my cereal.
- Peter.

02:06:48.517 --> 02:06:50.590
Where you going?

02:07:00.153 --> 02:07:01.600
I don't know.

02:07:03.490 --> 02:07:05.563
You know, it's so funny.
I've been...

02:07:05.909 --> 02:07:09.153
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized,

02:07:09.162 --> 02:07:13.783
and been putting some
of Ben's stuff in boxes.

02:07:14.167 --> 02:07:18.288
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:20.923
- You're throwing his stuff away?
- No.

02:07:20.924 --> 02:07:22.508
No. God, no.

02:07:22.509 --> 02:07:26.038
I couldn't do that.
It's part of me.

02:07:26.513 --> 02:07:29.883
I'm just finding

02:07:30.433 --> 02:07:32.301
a better place for it.

02:07:35.647 --> 02:07:37.970
I'm gonna take one last look,

02:07:39.025 --> 02:07:41.052
and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

02:08:05.927 --> 02:08:10.548
<i>It's easy to feel hopeful on
a beautiful day like today.</i>

02:08:11.349 --> 02:08:14.628
<i>But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.</i>

02:08:15.061 --> 02:08:18.010
<i>There will be days
where you feel all alone.</i>

02:08:20.150 --> 02:08:22.973
<i>And that's when hope
is needed most.</i>

02:08:24.029 --> 02:08:26.477
