magic touch, dude!

09:14.453 --> 09:17.089
- Coby versus Garrett,
long bomb throw.

09:17.156 --> 09:20.559
First one to put it in the net
is the winner and has the honor

slimiest slime there is.

Here's what we know for sure.
I'm getting slimed.

The other thing that
I think we figured out

10:10.776 --> 10:12.845
is that I'm our
best candidate for the NFL.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.680

with that one.

Let's go get slimed, huh?

slimed, not us.

- Thanks for joining
us, DeMarcus.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.933
I gotta tell you, we got
inspired by you because

12:13.999 --> 12:15.734
we heard you were a four-sport
athlete in high school.

12:15.801 --> 12:16.735
Is that true?

12:16.802 --> 12:18.137
- All four sports.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.739
Football was my main deal.
Baseball, I could smash it.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.308
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

12:22.374 --> 12:25.911
- Okay, well, got inspired by
your four-sport prowess

12:25.978 --> 12:28.047
and decided we should come up
with our own little game

12:28.114 --> 12:30.816
that involves four different
sports,combining them into one.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.119
We don't know exactly
what that looks like yet,

12:33.185 --> 12:34.820
but we're gonna come
up with something.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.890
- I'm a little afraid.
I don't know about that, guys.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.258
- I think you got
that backwards.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.427

are supposed to be afraid.

Well, we'll figure out what the
sport, we'll get back together,

play golf with DeMarcus?

13:00.012 --> 13:02.548
- I mean, dude, any
athlete is a golfer.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.716
- If we're gonna do golf,

13:03.782 --> 13:05.284
I think we gotta mix it up
a litle.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.119
- I agree.
What abotu some ping pong balls?

13:07.186 --> 13:08.521

with ping pongs?

- Code, why don't you
get up there, give it a go?

- BOTH: Oh!
- That's a stinger!

13:32.044 --> 13:33.779

dodgeball or golf?

I'm hitting it!

13:49.461 --> 13:50.329
I'm still in!

13:51.597 --> 13:53.532

going that way?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.735
- I don't know if that
sport's gonna work out.

13:56.802 --> 13:59.338

Let's try something on the turf.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.673
Hoverboard football.

14:00.739 --> 14:02.308

14:03.209 --> 14:04.877
- Oh, are you all right?
- Close.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.146
- All right, teams are Gary and
Coby versus Cory and Ty.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.747
I'll play all-time
Q on the tricycle.

14:08.814 --> 14:10.516

14:10.583 --> 14:12.551
Put myself in motion.

Fourth down!

14:33.639 --> 14:35.307

hard of a game.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.609
- Fourth down!

14:36.675 --> 14:38.043
- This is a great game.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.812
I'm just worried about
DeMarcus riding on this sucker.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.481
- I agree.
But until then, hut!

14:42.548 --> 14:43.816
- Scramble quarterback.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.251
Buy some time!

14:45.317 --> 14:47.052
I'm horrible at this!

gotta go all the way.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.823

14:59.465 --> 15:01.133
- Was that a scrunchie?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.302
- Was a devastating nose blow.
- If you're good,

15:03.369 --> 15:05.170
that's one of the funniest
things I've ever seen.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.839
- No, I'm good.
What down is it?

15:06.905 --> 15:08.407
- I think that actually
was a turnover.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.309
Coby made the interception.
Let's go huddle up.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.111
- TYLER: That hurts.
- COBY: Yup, I agree.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.213
- We're all in agreement
this is not the sport,

15:14.280 --> 15:15.781
while fun, we wanna do
with DeMarcus?

15:15.848 --> 15:16.949
- I agree.
- Agreed, yeah.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.150
- Here's the other problem.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.719
He's still,
while being a big man--

15:20.786 --> 15:22.554
I would argue he's
faster than any of us.

15:22.621 --> 15:23.956
- Significantly.
- Definitely.

15:24.023 --> 15:25.357
- Actually, Coby's pretty quick.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.092
- Here's the playing
field levels, okay?

15:27.159 --> 15:28.861
Maybe DeMarcus is up here.

15:28.927 --> 15:33.632
Maybe I'm just a--
right in there.

15:33.699 --> 15:34.833
- That's you.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.368
- And then maybe you guys fall,

15:36.435 --> 15:38.704
I don't know,
somewhere in there.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.372
- Sure.
- Can we please add something

15:40.439 --> 15:42.107
that'll keep me from dying
if he hits me?

15:42.174 --> 15:43.309
- Yeah, it's a good point.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.010
Here's the things we
gotta be careful of.

15:45.077 --> 15:47.413
If it's physical,
DeMarcus will kill us.

15:47.479 --> 15:48.781
- Correct.

15:48.847 --> 15:51.150
- TYLER: So we need something
to even the playing field,

our bubble wrap video?

15:54.219 --> 15:56.088
We're all bubble wrapped up?

15:56.155 --> 15:58.657
That's a pretty even the
playing field type of thing.

15:58.724 --> 16:01.260

in the bubble wrap video?

16:01.327 --> 16:02.861

are trapped to our sides?

16:14.406 --> 16:16.375
- That seems reasonable.
- Sounds like our only option.

16:16.442 --> 16:19.645
- Yeah, first of three goals.
Ty and Garrett versus the twins.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.380
Remember, full contact is

use of our arms.

I did like the football, and
soccer, and golf parts so far.

I like the way
you run into each other

17:25.210 --> 17:26.478
a little bit better.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.679

we need an upgrade from
the bubble packaging.
