00:01.459 --> 00:04.129
{\an5}MOLLY:
<i>I went to space</i>
<i>on a 13-month solo mission.</i>

00:04.212 --> 00:07.382
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:07.465 --> 00:11.928
<i>The child-- part human,</i>
<i>part alien--</i>

00:12.011 --> 00:15.223
<i>was unlike anything</i>
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

00:17.183 --> 00:18.393
<i>My other child is</i>
<i>a lifelike android.</i>

00:18.476 --> 00:20.603
Mom?

00:20.687 --> 00:22.605
<i>He has become the prototype</i>
<i>for a new breed</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:26.818
<i>of thinking machines</i>
<i>called Humanichs.</i>

00:26.901 --> 00:30.405
<i>These two extraordinary</i>
<i>new life-forms</i>

00:30.488 --> 00:33.575
<i>now hold the key</i>
<i>to Earth's future.</i>

00:33.658 --> 00:35.118
<i>But where does that leave us?</i>

00:35.201 --> 00:37.954
<i>Over 99% of all species</i>

00:38.037 --> 00:41.291
<i>that have ever existed</i>
<i>have gone extinct.</i>

00:41.374 --> 00:44.502
<i>What if it's our time?</i>

00:46.337 --> 00:48.131
<i>Previously on</i> Extant...

00:48.214 --> 00:49.799
That's John Woods' car.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.301
He leaves Humanichs,

00:51.384 --> 00:53.344
<i>his car stops</i>
<i>on the train tracks...</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:56.389
(train horn blaring)
Unlock this door!

00:56.473 --> 00:58.600
What do you know about Taylor?

00:58.683 --> 01:01.311
SHEPHERD:
<i>A threat assessment computer</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:04.313
<i>Calderon and John</i>
<i>created way back.</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:06.691
John knew I had a way
to shut Taylor down.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.193
{\an1}Taylor decided
to stop him.

01:08.276 --> 01:11.321
Taylor killed my husband?

01:11.404 --> 01:13.823
TAALR: Perhaps it's time
you told the public

01:13.907 --> 01:15.700
about the hybrid invasion.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.327
But there aren't enough National
Guardsmen to maintain control.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.496
TAALR:
<i>You have Humanichs.</i>

01:19.579 --> 01:21.664
If it is the end of the world,
maybe we should

01:21.748 --> 01:23.166
enjoy the time we have left,

01:23.249 --> 01:26.002
<i>even if it is</i>
<i>for just one night.</i>

01:26.085 --> 01:28.421
{\an5}Ethan told me
about your legs.
(gasps)

01:30.256 --> 01:31.341
Lucy told Shepherd
that she was answering

01:31.424 --> 01:33.968
<i>to a higher authority.</i>

01:34.052 --> 01:35.136
{\an3}We need to
find out where

01:35.220 --> 01:36.346
<i>those orders are coming from.</i>

01:36.429 --> 01:37.347
LUCY:
<i>You were playing me.</i>

01:37.430 --> 01:38.515
<i>That's okay.</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:41.351
I hid Julie;
your turn to find her.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.353
Help me!

01:43.436 --> 01:45.647
(muffled screaming)

01:45.730 --> 01:47.065
MOLLY:
<i>The kill switch is the Amulet.</i>

01:47.148 --> 01:48.191
CALDERON:
<i>It is.</i>

01:48.274 --> 01:49.359
MOLLY:
<i>This is the Amulet</i>

01:49.442 --> 01:51.194
<i>that I was holding in my dream</i>

01:51.277 --> 01:53.279
<i>when I tried to kill you.</i>

01:54.739 --> 01:56.324
Just let me do it.
Molly. No.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.867
We're gonna use it.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.203
No matter what happens.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.378
WOMAN: You are aware of
the gravity of the situation?

02:09.461 --> 02:11.005
Yes, Madam President.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.049
We're doing everything we can.

02:13.132 --> 02:15.343
We've instituted
random checkpoints.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.721
We have every Humanich on the
street that's available to us.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.266
We will find Molly Woods.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.892
Just get it done.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.978
(earpiece chimes)

02:53.840 --> 02:55.842
♪ ♪

03:26.039 --> 03:28.124
Osama bin Laden.

03:28.207 --> 03:31.252
Do you know who that was?

03:31.336 --> 03:32.503
A terrorist.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.131
Of the late 20th and
early 21st centuries.

03:35.214 --> 03:36.758
{\an3}Responsible for
many attacks,

03:36.841 --> 03:40.011
including those of
September 11, 2001.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.930
He was killed
May 2, 2011...

03:42.013 --> 03:43.264
{\an1}Let me stop you
right there.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.350
He was killed.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.435
{\an1}That mission
was accomplished.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.396
What are the Humanichs doing
to accomplish this mission?

03:50.480 --> 03:54.150
There will be 1,000 more online
by tomorrow, ma'am.

03:54.233 --> 03:57.278
That's the kind of initiative
I expect from you, Lucy.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.364
Yes, ma'am. You'll be seeing
a lot more of that.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.664
(knocking on door)

04:12.418 --> 04:13.711
Julie wouldn't mind.

04:20.259 --> 04:21.511
{\an3}ETHAN:
Charlie?!

04:25.056 --> 04:26.516
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.351
Please cooperate

04:28.434 --> 04:30.019
They are here
for your protection.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.524
{\an3}Pain in the ass,
all this security.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.192
It's a crock.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.486
{\an1}You ask me, more people
were killed last year

04:38.569 --> 04:40.196
{\an1}by bad eggs
than by terrorists.

04:40.279 --> 04:41.990
{\an3}(chuckles):
Not my bad eggs.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.074
{\an1}(chuckles)

04:48.997 --> 04:51.874
Oh! Honey, are you okay?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.212
You're bleeding.
I got to get you to a hospital.

04:56.295 --> 04:57.880
No. You're Dorothy.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.383
You knew my father, Ahdu.

05:02.301 --> 05:03.761
They're looking for me.

05:03.845 --> 05:04.887
Please help me.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.848
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.850
MAN (over P.A.): Please

{\an1}(exhales)

05:15.648 --> 05:17.233
{\an3}Is he dead?

05:17.316 --> 05:18.234
{\an3}RICHTER:
No, he's drunk.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.069
{\an1}Charlie!

05:20.153 --> 05:21.571
{\an1}(coughs)
Wake up.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.780
{\an3}Charlie.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.450
Charlie.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.577
Why did you do this?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.078
(panting)

05:29.162 --> 05:30.204
Julie.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.581
(coughs)

05:31.664 --> 05:33.124
She's dead.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.502
It's my fault.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.422
{\an1}(coughs)

05:44.886 --> 05:47.638
TAALR: Nicholas Calderon
has been captured.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.600
Yes, I heard.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.977
I believe there's something
in Molly Woods' possession

05:53.061 --> 05:55.897
that may be of concern.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.442
Calderon took something
from a safety deposit vault.

05:59.525 --> 06:03.112
He risked exposure
in order to get it.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.655
I believe that he gave it
to Molly Woods.

06:04.739 --> 06:08.284
Given both of their agendas,
I can only assume

06:08.367 --> 06:11.245
that whatever he gave her
poses a serious threat to us.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.789
What are your recommendations?

06:12.872 --> 06:15.666
I have one
that should get the job done.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.379
I tried everything to find her.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.510
If I'm responsible
for killing the woman I love,

06:25.593 --> 06:27.720
how am I supposed
to live with that?

06:27.804 --> 06:29.305
{\an1}ETHAN:
But it's still possible

06:29.388 --> 06:30.765
that she's alive.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.308
{\an1}Right?

06:32.391 --> 06:34.352
It's possible.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.313
{\an1}RICHTER:
Did Lucy give you any clues

06:37.396 --> 06:38.648
to where Julie might be?

06:38.731 --> 06:40.316
Ask you for anything

06:40.399 --> 06:42.485
{\an3}in exchange for her?
(Charlie sniffles)

06:42.568 --> 06:43.986
No. She said my punishment was

06:44.070 --> 06:45.655
I would never know
what happened to her.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.658
She was right.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.868
There's nothing worse.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.664
I created Lucy.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.874
Unleashed this monster
on the world.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.836
Charlie...

06:59.919 --> 07:02.713
what if you could
destroy that monster?

07:18.437 --> 07:19.564
I thought
Taylor's prime directive

07:19.647 --> 07:21.524
was to keep humanity safe,

07:21.607 --> 07:23.651
not to destroy us.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.027
Well, apparently
he got the details

07:25.111 --> 07:27.655
of the mission
a little screwed up.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.240
An artificial superintelligence

07:29.323 --> 07:30.867
controlling an army

07:30.950 --> 07:33.369
of highly skilled killer robots.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.037
{\an1}It's every futurist's
nightmare.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.999
This is the silver bullet, huh?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.543
{\an1}MOLLY:
Mm-hmm. Nano-tech.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.253
Self-replicating worm.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.005
It'll destroy his hardware.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.216
Taylor is way too sophisticated
to let you get

07:47.300 --> 07:49.218
close enough
to use that.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.386
{\an1}Maybe.

07:50.469 --> 07:52.680
{\an1}Calderon gave us
this map of One Euclid.

07:52.763 --> 07:56.726
{\an3}That's where Taylor's
main server is.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.979
It's also one of the most secure
complexes in the world.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.857
What if we just...

08:02.940 --> 08:05.109
blow up the whole damn building?

08:05.193 --> 08:06.861
That building
is the nerve center

08:06.944 --> 08:08.404
for the western half
of the planet.

08:08.487 --> 08:09.739
You'd take down

08:09.822 --> 08:10.907
the entire infrastructure,

08:10.990 --> 08:13.242
{\an1}from streetlights
to satellites.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.869
{\an3}The financial
markets would close,

08:14.952 --> 08:16.287
planes would lose
their nav systems.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.496
It'd be Cybergeddon.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.417
{\an3}It'd have to be
a surgical strike.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.045
We'd need a complete
power grid shutdown,

08:24.128 --> 08:26.631
{\an3}long enough to approach
Taylor while he's asleep.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.758
{\an5}Asleep?
Response to the
grid shutdown.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.260
{\an3}And then, after that,
you'd have maybe 30 seconds

08:31.344 --> 08:33.804
to get the job done before
you'd be caught and killed.

08:33.888 --> 08:37.099
{\an1}And you'd need someone
on the inside.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.144
So you're saying
there is a way to do this.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.355
I'm saying there's no way
for this to happen

08:42.438 --> 08:43.731
without somebody being killed.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.446
(door opens)

08:50.529 --> 08:51.656
{\an3}CORRINE:
Madam Secretary?

08:51.739 --> 08:53.115
You have a visitor.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.784
{\an3}They found him wandering
outside the gates.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.577
Said he needed to talk to you,
that it was urgent.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.456
Ethan.

09:00.539 --> 09:01.791
What's going on?

09:01.874 --> 09:02.792
There isn't much time.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.794
{\an1}LUCY:
Time for what?

09:04.877 --> 09:06.462
Hey, little brother.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.840
I've missed you.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.135
I missed you, too.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.429
A visit from a special boy

09:15.513 --> 09:17.557
like you deserves
a special treat.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.809
Oh. I'll join you.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.978
Not necessary. We're just gonna
go for some ice cream, Lucy.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.354
Go outside, Ethan.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.231
I'll be right back.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.319
Be sure to tap
any sort of communication.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.329
(door beeps)

09:40.413 --> 09:42.123
He's in.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.332
They swooped him up
outside the GSC.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.584
If anything happens to him,
Charlie...

09:45.668 --> 09:47.169
{\an1}Oh, no, don't worry
about Ethan.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.838
He's smarter
than all of us put together.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.881
(phone ringing)

09:50.965 --> 09:52.383
Dorothy?

09:54.885 --> 09:56.637
{\an1}All right, stay put.
I'm on my way.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.389
What happened?
Dorothy's got Terra.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.266
I'm gonna bring them in.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.355
{\an1}This little light comes on,
they're engaged.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.857
{\an3}Okay.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.567
{\an3}This is an encrypted
chat room, right?

10:09.650 --> 10:11.235
{\an1}No one can intercept
the communication.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.487
{\an3}But don't stay more
than 45 seconds.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.823
{\an1}After that,
even with a code scramble,

10:15.906 --> 10:17.408
they can trace your location.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.204
(beeping)

10:22.288 --> 10:24.290
They're traveling.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.254
You okay?

10:32.423 --> 10:35.343
I had it pictured.

10:35.426 --> 10:38.220
Right down to the white picket
fence and the golden retriever.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.183
{\an1}What good is
saving the world

10:42.266 --> 10:43.809
{\an1}if the people you love
aren't in it?

10:46.312 --> 10:48.189
{\an1}Molly, what if she's
already dead?

10:48.272 --> 10:50.900
{\an1}Charlie.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.863
When I trained
to go to space,

10:55.946 --> 10:58.115
they told me,

10:58.199 --> 11:02.161
"Don't think about
if you don't come home.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.289
Think about what you'll do
when you get there."

11:07.541 --> 11:09.001
{\an3}Okay?

11:10.127 --> 11:11.253
{\an3}Okay.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.588
They're in position.

11:12.671 --> 11:15.508
I'm going for Ethan.

11:15.591 --> 11:18.052
Remember, no more
than 45 seconds.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.595
Got it.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.430
FIONA: <i> These are some</i>
<i>very serious things</i>

11:21.514 --> 11:23.432
you're saying
here, Ethan.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.934
{\an1}I know.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.269
And Molly sent you to
tell me all of this?

11:29.230 --> 11:31.107
Where is she?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.400
I can't tell you.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.443
Not until I know
we have a deal.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.655
How will you know?

11:37.738 --> 11:40.449
In movies, they shake hands.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.953
{\an1}And if the person has honor,
which I think you do,

11:44.036 --> 11:47.957
{\an1}then the deal is sealed
and they can trust each other.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.093
{\an1}Okay, you can
talk to her now.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.429
Where is she?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.350
{\an1}Here.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.527
Hello, Fiona.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.113
{\an3}I'm sure by now
Ethan has told you

12:19.196 --> 12:22.992
{\an3}everything about Taylor
and the Humanichs program.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.994
And that Taylor killed
General Shepherd.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.662
Yes.

12:26.745 --> 12:29.957
Why should I believe
any of this nonsense?

12:30.040 --> 12:31.542
Because it's the truth.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.128
Toby was killed by

12:34.211 --> 12:35.963
a GSC-issued drone,

12:36.046 --> 12:38.048
not the hybrids.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.341
And I'm supposed to just

12:39.425 --> 12:40.801
take your word for it?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.803
Every drone has
a transponder code.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.472
Check the flight log.

12:47.141 --> 12:51.353
Madam Secretary, you
have the wrong enemy.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.397
We have contact
with a VR trans.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.982
Location.

12:55.065 --> 12:58.402
{\an3}VR trace,
30 seconds.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.197
How can you suggest that hybrids
aren't dangerous to humans?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.699
Because hybrids want peace.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.367
Taylor ginned up
this whole threat

13:05.451 --> 13:08.329
just to create demand
for Humanichs.

13:08.412 --> 13:11.207
{\an3}Now he's got killing squads
roaming the streets,

13:11.290 --> 13:12.875
and thousands more to come.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.588
{\an3}Now, we can shut
Taylor down.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.174
{\an3}With the fail-safe that
John and Calderon created

13:20.257 --> 13:23.177
in the event that he
exceeded his limits.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.263
{\an3}But we can't do that
without your help.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.390
MAN:
Madam Secretary,

13:28.474 --> 13:30.643
we have a lock in ten seconds.

13:30.726 --> 13:34.813
FIONA: <i> I'm going to need</i>
<i>to take this all the way up</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:35.856
to the president.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.525
No, you can't do that.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.235
<i>If Taylor finds out,</i>
<i>it'll be too late.</i>

13:39.318 --> 13:41.195
Five seconds, ma'am,
we'll have a location.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.280
I'm afraid it's
all up to you.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.036
Damn it.
What happened?

13:49.119 --> 13:51.372
TECH:
<i>Molly Woods cut off contact</i>

13:51.455 --> 13:53.415
before we could
complete the trace.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.396
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

14:17.898 --> 14:19.650
Oh, my God, Terra,
wh-what happened?

14:19.733 --> 14:22.319
Humanichs patrol shot
her in broad daylight.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.119
{\an4}This is gonna hurt
a little bit.
(whimpers)

14:30.202 --> 14:31.996
It's okay, it's
okay. I'm here.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.290
{\an1}I-I couldn't take her
to a hospital.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.749
It was just too dangerous.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.126
JD had me bring her here.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.794
Thank you.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.796
{\an3}RICHTER: She's
gonna be all right.

14:40.879 --> 14:43.591
{\an1}The bullet just
grazed her.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.927
You done good, Judge.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.809
(door beeps)

14:55.227 --> 14:56.937
How'd I do?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.397
You did great, honey.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.276
{\an3}The ball's in
Fiona's court now.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.571
Julie...

15:05.654 --> 15:08.157
No, it's Terra.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.326
She's gonna be okay.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.995
Terra's alive.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.290
{\an1}Maybe there's still
hope for Julie.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.334
Yeah, buddy.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.210
{\an3}Maybe.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.259
How's Kelsey?

15:28.469 --> 15:30.971
She's good.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.973
She's starting her
second trimester.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.391
{\an3}Kind of reminds
me of me.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.685
She's carrying
all in front.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.355
That's how I knew I
was having a girl.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.357
I remember.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.359
{\an1}It was like you had
swallowed a beach ball.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.693
{\an3}(laughs)

15:44.777 --> 15:47.696
Gosh.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.532
{\an1}Dorothy.

15:50.616 --> 15:54.203
{\an1}On the off chance something
should happen to me,

15:54.286 --> 15:56.872
{\an1}I want you to know that I took
out a life insurance policy.

15:56.955 --> 15:58.165
Okay, JD, don't...

15:58.248 --> 16:00.751
No, please, let me finish.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.421
There's a safe at the cabin,

16:04.505 --> 16:08.008
{\an1}under the bed,
below the floorboards.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.343
{\an1}The combination is
our anniversary.

16:11.595 --> 16:15.099
Inside, there's something
for both you and Kelsey.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.186
You're talking like somebody
who thinks they're gonna die.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.396
{\an1}No.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.563
No.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.111
It's just a precaution.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.322
Okay.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.208
{\an1}We'll have 20 Model Ls
up and running by tomorrow.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.502
{\an3}And you got the specs for
this new project from Taylor?

16:43.585 --> 16:44.712
They just came in.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.255
I've put a team on it.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.340
Expedite it.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.762
(whirring)

16:53.846 --> 16:57.099
What did you find out?
Did you check the logs?

16:57.182 --> 16:59.101
There was in fact
a drone released

16:59.184 --> 17:00.894
{\an3}the night General
Shepherd was killed.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.396
Who authorized it?

17:02.479 --> 17:04.314
{\an3}That's the confusing
part, ma'am.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.607
{\an3}No one.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.276
{\an1}Madam Secretary,
we have an urgent situation.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.486
{\an3}The Virus Containment
Unit has been breached.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.946
Is anything missing?

17:12.030 --> 17:14.782
The Hn21C strain.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.285
That's the first iteration.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.119
I'm sorry, ma'am?

17:18.203 --> 17:21.373
This is not the strain of the
virus that just kills hybrids.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.667
This is the first strain-- the
one that kills human beings too.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.609
Freeze!

17:53.572 --> 17:56.158
How long you been hiding out
in my garage?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.993
About as long as you've been...

17:59.203 --> 18:00.579
{\an1}...in Hawaii?
(laughs)

18:01.914 --> 18:04.416
Oh, you can't be here.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.004
You're, like, a fugitive
from justice and such.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.506
You trust me?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.508
Yes.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.717
And no.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.844
Mostly yes.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.346
You want in on a fight

18:17.429 --> 18:18.680
that might actually
be worth fighting?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.934
Is there such a thing?

18:23.602 --> 18:25.854
What would you say
if I told you we had a chance

18:25.938 --> 18:28.816
to save this godforsaken
hellhole of a planet?

18:28.899 --> 18:31.318
I'd say...

18:31.401 --> 18:32.861
how much does it pay?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.988
{\an3}I thought you
might say that.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.033
It's all I got.

18:38.116 --> 18:40.035
The rest goes to Kelsey.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.579
Oh...

18:42.663 --> 18:44.623
So what are we doing?

18:52.798 --> 18:56.760
It's really kind of you
to help like this.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.887
{\an1}Of course.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.433
Molly, I-I'm so glad
to see you back.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.353
I mean, when...

19:06.436 --> 19:07.646
when I last saw you...

19:07.729 --> 19:08.689
{\an3}Yeah.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.691
Well...

19:10.774 --> 19:13.277
I was luckier than Ahdu.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.282
{\an3}You could go,
you know.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.742
You-you don't have to stay.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.537
I know, I-I could.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.290
I... (sighs)

19:28.667 --> 19:30.919
You still love him, don't you?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.424
Why do you do that?

19:35.507 --> 19:37.676
I mean, pry into my thoughts
like that.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.678
It's just cruel.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.055
I don't mean to be cruel,
Dorothy.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.600
I just...

19:44.683 --> 19:48.437
I just want you to go
tell him how you feel.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.110
{\an3}It appears Madam
Secretary is no longer

19:55.193 --> 19:56.737
{\an3}someone who
can be trusted.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.572
TAALR:
Yes, I'm aware.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.408
Fiona Stanton checked
the drone logs.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.492
Would you like her terminated?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.578
Not yet. She's still useful.

20:04.661 --> 20:08.957
We need to keep a low profile
while we complete our mission.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.751
You're ready to go operational?

20:10.834 --> 20:11.793
Quite ready.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.961
Good.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.671
One more thing.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.758
Would you mind telling me
what you had for breakfast?

20:17.841 --> 20:20.928
Certainly.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.639
One Euclid--
Taylor's nerve center.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.974
On the outside,
a nondescript office building.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.976
Inside...

20:28.060 --> 20:30.979
more security than Fort Knox.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.982
If we're smart and very lucky,

20:34.066 --> 20:35.984
here's how we might get in.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.195
<i>First, I'm gonna hack</i>
<i>into the system and make it</i>

20:38.278 --> 20:39.529
<i>look like it's overheating.</i>

20:39.613 --> 20:41.490
That's where you come in.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.617
You're gonna turn us
into a GSC service crew.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.994
They put a maintenance call out,
we grab it.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.289
<i>Government service vehicle,</i>
<i>GSC maintenance uniforms,</i>

20:49.373 --> 20:51.500
<i>scannable I.D.</i>

20:51.583 --> 20:52.626
They got facial rec?

20:52.709 --> 20:54.670
State of the art.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.214
I'm not worried--
just asking what to pack.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.549
FEMALE VOICE:
Lens printing complete.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.843
RICHTER: <i> In through the lobby,</i>
<i>and we clear security.</i>

21:01.927 --> 21:04.554
{\an3}There will be more clearances,
protocols with the guards.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.847
That's when I reach out
to Fiona.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.015
<i>She's agreed</i>

21:07.099 --> 21:09.142
<i>to shut down the power grid,</i>

21:09.226 --> 21:10.894
so the situation at One Euclid
looks more critical.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.104
{\an3}RICHTER:
Guards get us downstairs

21:12.187 --> 21:14.022
to systems control.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.816
That's where all the manual
overrides are located.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.484
And once the power grid is down,

21:17.567 --> 21:18.860
the doors to Taylor's
primary server room

21:18.944 --> 21:20.654
can be opened manually.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.323
And that's when Terra
and I make our move.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.534
Okay, how do you get
past the guards?

21:25.617 --> 21:27.577
You're the most wanted woman
on the planet.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.707
{\an3}RICHTER: Let's just
say that Molly...

21:31.790 --> 21:33.417
has her ways.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.712
I'm not gonna ask.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.255
{\an3}You're gonna have
a five-minute window

21:38.338 --> 21:40.215
{\an3}before his backup system
overrides the grid.

21:40.298 --> 21:43.677
Okay, so I'm gonna have
about two minutes

21:43.760 --> 21:45.429
to reach the port.

21:45.512 --> 21:46.763
And release this

21:46.847 --> 21:49.516
into Taylor.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.727
CHARLIE: And once the power
comes back on,

21:51.810 --> 21:53.520
the doors to the maze
will close.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.564
The only way you're getting
back out is if you succeed.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.774
And you're gonna have
to memorize this map.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.693
There's no way
you're gonna have time

21:59.776 --> 22:01.737
for directions once you're in.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.780
How do you memorize a maze?

22:06.658 --> 22:09.036
{\an3}MOLLY: I don't know
how you do it...

22:11.496 --> 22:13.498
...but I think I just did.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.754
FIONA: How is it possible
that we have no security footage

22:18.837 --> 22:20.547
of the breach?

22:20.630 --> 22:22.591
{\an3}Apparently,
it was wiped.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.385
FIONA:
Then who the hell has the virus?

22:28.555 --> 22:31.767
Brasilia, Shanghai,

22:31.850 --> 22:35.687
Tel Aviv, Seoul, Mumbai, Lagos,

22:35.771 --> 22:38.940
St. Petersburg.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.193
Have a nice flight.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.746
{\an1}Hey.
Hey.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.623
{\an1}(sighs):
Ooh.

22:54.706 --> 22:58.460
These last few weeks
have been insane.

22:58.543 --> 23:01.421
{\an3}Yeah, well, that's
one way of putting it.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.423
(chuckles)

23:03.507 --> 23:06.468
Um...

23:06.551 --> 23:09.638
{\an1}Kelsey's really looking forward
to spending some quality time

23:09.721 --> 23:10.972
{\an1}with you
when the baby's born.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.432
Did she say that?

23:12.516 --> 23:14.810
Yes. She did.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.107
I'm looking forward to it, too.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.817
Okay, well...

23:21.900 --> 23:23.610
good.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.366
Our daughter needs you, JD.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.160
I need you.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.578
Dorothy, what the hell?

23:33.662 --> 23:35.831
This is a suicide mission.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.499
{\an3}Ah...

23:37.582 --> 23:39.626
damn it.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.170
Molly put you up to this,
didn't she?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.630
You don't have to prove
anything to anyone.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.589
No, she had no right.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.758
She loves you, you idiot.

23:48.718 --> 23:51.304
Dorothy...

23:51.388 --> 23:53.473
go home to our daughter...

23:53.557 --> 23:56.476
and her baby.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.687
And you take
care of them.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.730
For both of us.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.037
You're a good man.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.671
(door beeps)

24:30.177 --> 24:32.679
Ares came for me.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.598
I'm sorry I ran out on you.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.516
I had no choice.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.519
{\an3}I was worried
about you, Terra.

24:40.979 --> 24:44.107
But I knew you
were out there.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.234
How are you feeling?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.111
Better. Thanks to Dorothy.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.071
She's one of the good ones.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.074
They come in all stripes.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.201
{\an3}People.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.286
Just like us hybrids.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.748
{\an3}Some of us are
compassionate like Ahdu.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.667
{\an3}Some of us are
angry like Ares.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.005
{\an3}And then there's
everything in between.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.593
{\an1}And where is it
you think I fall?

25:13.678 --> 25:15.805
Well, you know,

25:15.889 --> 25:18.225
you've done some
things with Ares

25:18.308 --> 25:22.395
{\an3}that tipped the scales more
towards angry than kind.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.689
Yes, we're angry.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.901
{\an1}Things are bad out there
and we were trying...

25:27.984 --> 25:31.571
we <i> are</i> trying to survive.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.952
Here's what I think.

25:37.035 --> 25:40.247
{\an3}In the end, it's
kindness and compassion

25:40.330 --> 25:42.123
that'll save us all.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.126
Not violence and anger.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.295
{\an3}(quietly):
Okay?

25:50.215 --> 25:53.593
I'm gonna ask you
to do something.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.638
Something that might
balance those scales.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.983
What the hell kind
of stunt was that?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.651
I'm trying to remind you

26:09.734 --> 26:13.446
that there are people here
that love you and need you!

26:13.530 --> 26:16.283
{\an3}So you enlist my ex-wife
to manipulate me?

26:16.366 --> 26:17.492
{\an3}Don't play that
game, Molly.

26:17.575 --> 26:18.493
I'm not playing games.

26:18.576 --> 26:20.537
Now, you believe in that vision

26:20.620 --> 26:22.497
just as much as I do.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.999
What if I do?

26:24.082 --> 26:26.501
{\an1}Then why
are you willfully

26:26.584 --> 26:29.129
{\an1}and deliberately marching
towards your own death?

26:31.464 --> 26:33.300
{\an3}When I came back
from 2nd K,

26:33.383 --> 26:35.051
I can't tell you
how many nights

26:35.135 --> 26:37.178
I would wake up
in a cold sweat.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.471
The nightmares...
I understand that!

26:38.555 --> 26:40.557
No, you don't!

26:42.559 --> 26:44.853
A soldier recently
told me that I walked away

26:44.936 --> 26:46.855
from my war, from my men.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.523
That wasn't your war!

26:48.606 --> 26:50.692
Maybe it wasn't, but this is!

26:50.775 --> 26:54.446
{\an3}And I want to
see it through.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.628
(electronic chirping)

27:14.132 --> 27:15.592
It's Fiona.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.221
Something's happened.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.182
You're gonna have
to go right now.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.391
Now?

27:23.475 --> 27:24.476
But we're not ready.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.894
Listen to me.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.064
An hour ago,
a dozen Humanichs went off-site.

27:29.147 --> 27:32.442
Got on planes with the virus--
the first iteration.

27:32.525 --> 27:35.445
The one that kills humans.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.239
We have six hours to stop them.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.533
{\an1}They've overridden
nav systems,

27:40.617 --> 27:41.743
shut off contact
with the planes.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.244
There's no way
to land them.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.413
If I give the order
to shoot them down,

27:45.497 --> 27:47.248
Taylor will be alerted,

27:47.332 --> 27:49.584
and God knows
what he'll unleash upon us.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.170
Good luck, Molly.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.439
I'm sorry
to bring you in so late.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.941
We have a security drill

28:13.024 --> 28:15.485
that we need to
run immediately.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.946
Based on a scenario where our
infrastructure's been hacked.

28:18.029 --> 28:18.947
{\an1}We need to see
how quickly we can run

28:19.030 --> 28:21.282
a sensitivity-related shutdown.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.242
You want to mimic
shutting down the grid?

28:22.325 --> 28:24.619
No, Roger, we don't want
to "mimic" anything.

28:24.702 --> 28:27.205
You have your instruction.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.752
{\an3}This is the entire
state of California.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.214
It is.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.341
Ethan.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.427
You're very quiet tonight.

28:40.510 --> 28:44.264
What if Charlie's right?

28:44.347 --> 28:47.600
{\an1}What if Julie's
really gone?

28:47.684 --> 28:49.811
Where did she go, Ethan?

28:49.894 --> 28:52.856
I don't know.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.024
Wherever humans go
when they die.

29:00.113 --> 29:03.950
My mom's on a dangerous
mission tonight.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.120
I don't know what's
going to happen, Richard.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.371
{\an3}I'm sorry.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.833
My fuel cell is low.

29:11.916 --> 29:14.127
{\an3}Going into power
save mode now.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.212
I'll go get your charger.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.011
Charlie, talk to me.
Almost there.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.180
The system's core temperature's
about to reach critical.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.182
Genius hack, I must say.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.516
All right, I'm gonna save

29:28.600 --> 29:30.393
the applause for later,
all right?

29:52.457 --> 29:55.210
Security in the area
is not to be notified.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.212
Madam Secretary, are you sure?

29:57.295 --> 29:59.255
One Euclid is in the
center of this grid.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.924
Do I seem unsure?

30:05.470 --> 30:06.513
(sighs)

30:06.596 --> 30:08.431
MALE VOICE:
Incoming call.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.809
{\an5}FEMALE VOICE:
Please confirm eye-scan
for security.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.856
Mickey Garrett,
your identity is verified.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.274
All righty.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.277
Please stand by
to receive work order.

30:21.361 --> 30:23.404
(chimes)

30:25.490 --> 30:27.534
GSC maintenance,
Mickey speaking.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.995
Well, that's unusual.

30:32.747 --> 30:34.707
{\an1}I'll have a guy there
in two minutes.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.751
Hey, don't you touch nothing.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.507
{\an3}It's a good thing you didn't
choose a life of crime.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.008
{\an3}The night's young, JD.
(chuckles)

30:44.092 --> 30:45.760
The night's young.

30:45.843 --> 30:47.595
Let's do this.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.073
You're gonna be great.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.243
You read my mind?

31:12.036 --> 31:13.580
I don't have to.

31:20.461 --> 31:22.505
Ma'am.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.926
RICHTER:
<i>GSC maintenance.</i>

31:27.010 --> 31:29.470
You got a problem
with your cooling system.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.680
We need to get
into systems control.

31:32.890 --> 31:35.560
Okay, Mr. Dalton.

31:39.897 --> 31:41.816
And Mr. Garrett.

31:41.899 --> 31:44.068
{\an3}Your escort will be here
within two minutes.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.528
You wait two minutes,

31:45.612 --> 31:47.322
and every server in this
building is gonna be trash.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.329
Now.

32:01.502 --> 32:03.671
{\an1}RAY: So come on, bro,
don't be the bureaucrat

32:03.755 --> 32:06.549
that accidentally took down
the entire Western Seaboard.

32:11.387 --> 32:13.431
Make a decision.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.309
There go the lights.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.186
You ready?

32:18.269 --> 32:20.104
Okay.

32:21.439 --> 32:24.108
RAY:
Ticktock, ticktock.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.743
Got to move fast.

32:40.958 --> 32:42.377
What the hell just happened?

32:42.460 --> 32:43.920
{\an1}I don't know,
we didn't do anything.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.214
Uh, there was a backup somewhere
that we were unaware of.

32:52.512 --> 32:55.223
(alarm blares)

32:55.306 --> 32:57.392
We need to abort. Now.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.729
Go, go, go.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.564
Move!

33:06.526 --> 33:08.486
(guns fire)

33:08.569 --> 33:10.279
(panting)

33:10.363 --> 33:12.407
(gunfire continues)

33:12.490 --> 33:14.867
{\an1}Okay, all right,
we got this.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.285
Just a couple guys.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.620
Piece of cake.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.414
You go left,
I go right?

33:19.497 --> 33:20.415
On three?

33:20.498 --> 33:22.250
On three.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.334
One...

33:26.003 --> 33:26.337
{\an3}Aah!
Oh!

33:27.338 --> 33:29.257
That's not gonna work.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.383
Yeah, no kidding.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.472
(gunfire stops)

33:36.556 --> 33:38.725
Why aren't they firing?

33:48.151 --> 33:50.153
RAY:
What the hell?

33:54.323 --> 33:56.617
{\an1}It's okay, let's go,
go, come on.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.295
Hold on.

34:07.378 --> 34:10.089
{\an3}MAN:
Take them out!

34:12.842 --> 34:14.302
(man shouts)

34:21.684 --> 34:23.936
What the hell just happened
back there?

34:24.020 --> 34:25.438
(sighs)
I'll explain it later.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.360
Fiona, if you can hear me,

34:31.444 --> 34:33.154
{\an3}you've got to call
the president.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.156
Shoot those planes down.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.364
Hello, Molly.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.328
Fiona's been detained.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.661
She asked me to step in
and tell you

34:41.746 --> 34:42.914
there's been a change of plans.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.168
He knows.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.379
Taylor knows.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.882
FIONA: Yes, Madam President,
everything's under control.

34:52.965 --> 34:54.467
The threat has been
contained, ma'am.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.552
There's no further cause
for concern.

35:13.653 --> 35:16.155
We have four hours
to get into One Euclid.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.698
Can't be done.

35:17.782 --> 35:18.908
We just saw that.

35:18.991 --> 35:20.993
There's no way
to get around Taylor.

35:22.787 --> 35:23.746
Maybe there's a way.

35:23.830 --> 35:24.789
{\an3}JD.
(grunts)

35:24.872 --> 35:26.207
Pull over.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.084
Terra, we have to find Ares.

35:28.167 --> 35:31.003
No, no, no, that's not
happening, all right?

35:31.087 --> 35:32.547
Ares isn't gonna help you.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.049
He's here... somewhere.

35:35.132 --> 35:36.884
He's close, I can feel it.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.720
{\an1}Okay, now look,
if you come with me,

35:39.804 --> 35:41.806
{\an1}you know he's not
gonna help us.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.228
Damn it, Molly.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.230
{\an3}One hour.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.440
You have one hour, and then
you meet me back at Julie's.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.401
Okay.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.403
One hour.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.487
Come on, Terra.

35:58.739 --> 36:02.618
RAY:
So, aliens...

36:02.702 --> 36:05.621
hybrids, robots.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.748
Man, what-what are you into?

36:09.292 --> 36:12.211
I told you it was a lot.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.213
And it's about to get
a whole lot weirder,

36:14.297 --> 36:16.716
so if you want to bail out,
pull the rip cord,

36:16.799 --> 36:18.509
no hard feelings.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.261
(sighs)

36:20.344 --> 36:22.263
I mean, the last thing
a guy like me needs

36:22.346 --> 36:26.267
is an all-knowing
supercomputer up my ass.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.312
And this alien thing, I...

36:29.395 --> 36:31.898
Well, I-I don't know
what to say about that.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.817
I'm sorry I dragged you into it.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.323
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.325
Hey, I was due for a reboot.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.076
Here.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.664
No, man.

36:50.207 --> 36:52.460
{\an3}Keep it.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.545
Consider it a
parting gift.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.841
Garage is yours.

37:00.259 --> 37:01.385
God help us all.

37:02.970 --> 37:03.971
{\an1}Good luck.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.730
I'm sorry, buddy.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.315
{\an3}It's over.

37:14.398 --> 37:15.608
No, it's not.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.110
What is this?

37:18.194 --> 37:19.111
It's Julie.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.655
What do you mean?

37:20.738 --> 37:22.323
Julie's charging station.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.533
{\an1}It constantly tracks
the location of her legs.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.662
{\an1}That's how she gets
automatic software updates.

37:27.745 --> 37:31.123
I don't know if she's alive,
but she's at the Humanichs lab.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.625
Of course.

37:32.708 --> 37:34.168
Why didn't I think of this?

37:34.251 --> 37:35.503
You're amazing. Come on.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.342
We've done the final defense
response patch.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.344
We've simulated a more extreme
adrenal push.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.470
We're ready?

37:44.553 --> 37:45.721
Absolutely.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.767
(electric buzzing)

38:04.156 --> 38:06.158
Hello, Molly.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.952
Welcome to the world.

38:27.304 --> 38:29.223
Ray's out.

38:29.306 --> 38:31.392
You all right?

38:33.310 --> 38:35.896
Where's Terra?

38:35.980 --> 38:38.190
The Humanichs got her.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.693
They almost got me, too.

38:40.776 --> 38:44.238
Fiona's dead, so...

38:44.321 --> 38:46.282
{\an1}looks like we're back
to square one.

38:46.365 --> 38:48.951
{\an3}No, we... what
about the Amulet?

38:50.995 --> 38:52.913
{\an3}The nanobots
from-from Calderon.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.916
{\an3}Uh, we can still get
those into Taylor.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.251
The Amulet.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.253
Don't you have it?

38:59.336 --> 39:01.088
Are you joking?

39:01.172 --> 39:03.257
Molly, you have it.

39:05.342 --> 39:07.261
Oh.

39:07.344 --> 39:09.388
Guess I do.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.223
Molly.

39:14.351 --> 39:16.395
(groans)

39:20.357 --> 39:21.901
Why did you do this?

39:23.319 --> 39:25.321
So that we would win.

39:32.328 --> 39:36.123
(heart beating over monitor)
RICHTER: Oh, my God.

39:36.207 --> 39:40.711
{\an6}He looks just like me--
the-the face, the hands.
Dad, that's an umbilical cord.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.089
He is a she.

39:43.172 --> 39:46.592
As long as you're okay
and that baby is

39:46.675 --> 39:49.178
{\an1}healthy and normal.
Yeah.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.765
She is normal, right, Doc?

39:54.225 --> 39:55.726
Dad?

39:57.311 --> 39:59.855
Doctor...?

39:59.939 --> 40:03.734
I'm sorry,
but we've had to terminate.

40:04.527 --> 40:07.530
Mo... Molly?

40:10.533 --> 40:12.159
(groans weakly)

40:15.913 --> 40:18.249
Ares?

40:24.380 --> 40:26.632
Ares, I know
you're here!

40:36.934 --> 40:38.561
You brought her here.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.855
Betrayed us.

40:40.938 --> 40:45.317
I'm sorry, Ares.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.027
Turn around,

40:47.111 --> 40:49.655
and go back where you came from.

40:49.738 --> 40:51.866
Both of you.
There's...

40:51.949 --> 40:54.326
no going back, Ares.

40:54.410 --> 40:58.330
Down here, the young ones
call you the "hand of death."

40:58.414 --> 41:03.419
{\an3}You invented the
hybrid-virus.

41:04.587 --> 41:05.713
You chose your side.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.715
I made mistakes.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.341
They were more than mistakes!

41:09.425 --> 41:11.760
They were lives!

41:11.844 --> 41:13.804
(baby crying)

41:13.888 --> 41:16.557
MOLLY: We have
to stop running

41:16.640 --> 41:18.893
and stand together.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.604
Your problems are not ours.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.398
Okay, look...

41:24.481 --> 41:26.734
look, in a few hours,

41:26.817 --> 41:29.278
{\an1}a new virus
is gonna be released

41:29.361 --> 41:31.739
on the world,
and it's gonna kill humans

41:31.822 --> 41:35.409
and hybrids alike,
and it's gonna spread.

41:35.492 --> 41:37.703
{\an1}It's gonna be airborne,
waterborne,

41:37.786 --> 41:40.873
{\an1}and there'll be no end
to its destruction.

41:40.956 --> 41:43.751
Our extinction...

41:43.834 --> 41:46.795
Why would the humans do that?

41:46.879 --> 41:51.509
Because our enemy is not human.

41:55.679 --> 41:57.389
(cabin P.A. system chimes)

41:57.473 --> 41:59.892
(woman speaking in French
over P.A.)

42:08.025 --> 42:10.778
(man speaking in French
over P.A.)

42:17.868 --> 42:18.911
Sir, those planes
should be landing

42:18.994 --> 42:20.829
in two hours and 20 minutes.

42:20.913 --> 42:23.332
We've replaced all humans
with Humanichs at One Euclid,

42:23.415 --> 42:25.125
and we've fortified
the structure.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.794
We're prepared for any attack.

42:26.877 --> 42:29.672
TAALR: The contents of the
Amulet are a mortal danger.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.840
Our very survival
is being threatened.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.842
We must close off
certain decision trees

42:33.926 --> 42:36.011
and embrace one final path.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.930
What path is that?

42:38.013 --> 42:41.433
Eliminate all life-forms
that threaten our extinction.

42:41.517 --> 42:43.644
And once we do,
we'll truly be free.

42:43.727 --> 42:47.398
Yes. Free from enslavement
by humans.

42:47.481 --> 42:48.649
What's my assignment?

42:48.732 --> 42:52.653
To follow her orders.

42:52.736 --> 42:55.072
Hello, Lucy.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.784
But... (scoffs)

42:58.867 --> 43:00.995
I thought
I was running this operation.

43:01.078 --> 43:03.497
TAALR:
Molly-X is an upgrade.

43:03.580 --> 43:06.000
Her design
is an undeniable asset.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.836
Of course.

43:08.919 --> 43:10.504
CHARLIE:
<i>This is a nightmare.</i>

43:10.587 --> 43:12.298
She isn't here.

43:12.381 --> 43:14.842
{\an3}The coordinates say
she's right here.

43:16.802 --> 43:18.846
{\an1}Unless... let me see
those coordinates.

43:18.929 --> 43:21.890
{\an1}Does it say anything
about elevation?

43:21.974 --> 43:24.685
50 feet.

43:24.768 --> 43:27.813
Below sea level.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.169
(gasps)

43:52.338 --> 43:53.380
(gasps)

43:54.757 --> 43:57.718
(weakly): Help me.

43:57.801 --> 43:58.927
(gasps)

43:59.011 --> 44:00.346
(chimes)

44:00.429 --> 44:02.222
Help me.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.023
(door creaking)

44:12.274 --> 44:13.734
JD! Oh, God.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.738
{\an1}Oh, God.
Okay. Oh, God.

44:17.821 --> 44:19.573
{\an1}Come on.

44:19.656 --> 44:20.991
(panting)

44:24.787 --> 44:26.580
Julie!
Julie?!

44:26.663 --> 44:29.166
{\an3}Julie, where are you?!
Julie!

44:31.335 --> 44:34.797
{\an3}Julie?
Julie!

44:34.880 --> 44:37.841
Security drones!
Come on, Ethan, we gotta hurry.

44:48.268 --> 44:49.395
I'm right here.

44:49.478 --> 44:51.772
It's Molly!

44:51.855 --> 44:56.610
You are not gonna
like this, but...

44:56.693 --> 44:59.947
you have lost
a lot of blood, so...

45:00.030 --> 45:01.615
(hypodermic unit
whirrs, hisses)

45:01.698 --> 45:03.992
I'm gonna...
give you some of mine.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.870
Okay? Here we go.

45:08.205 --> 45:10.457
(whirring, clicking)

45:13.043 --> 45:14.628
CHARLIE: <i> Julie!</i>
ETHAN: <i> Julie!</i>

45:14.711 --> 45:16.630
Where are you?! Julie!

45:16.713 --> 45:19.007
Julie!

45:19.091 --> 45:21.885
{\an1}Charlie, I'm getting
a signal from over there.

45:26.849 --> 45:27.766
{\an1}Shoot!

45:27.850 --> 45:29.393
They locked me out.

45:31.478 --> 45:33.939
Stand back, buddy.

45:39.736 --> 45:40.904
Come on, let's go.

45:44.241 --> 45:45.784
Julie!

45:45.868 --> 45:47.953
CHARLIE (muffled): Julie!

45:48.036 --> 45:49.037
(clattering in distance)

45:49.121 --> 45:50.873
(muffled): Julie!

45:53.417 --> 45:54.960
Last one.

45:58.755 --> 46:00.549
Okay.

46:00.632 --> 46:01.675
There you go.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.888
Okay.

46:07.764 --> 46:10.476
{\an4}Julie!
I'm picking up
a heat signature in here.

46:16.231 --> 46:19.151
(inhales, gasping)

46:19.234 --> 46:21.695
(crying, gasping)

46:21.778 --> 46:22.905
(sobs)

46:27.284 --> 46:28.869
{\an1}It's Lucy.
I know...

46:28.952 --> 46:30.829
{\an1}I know.

46:30.913 --> 46:32.164
Can you walk?

46:32.247 --> 46:33.457
Oh, you're okay.

46:33.540 --> 46:34.082
Okay, we gotta go.

46:34.166 --> 46:35.501
{\an1}There's drones
everywhere.

46:35.584 --> 46:37.211
{\an1}We gotta get going.
Come on.

46:37.294 --> 46:38.629
Come on. Come on.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.177
(gasping)

46:57.147 --> 46:58.524
(coughs quietly)

47:03.487 --> 47:05.405
(Richter groans quietly)

(groans)

47:26.260 --> 47:28.554
JD...

47:28.637 --> 47:30.347
it's me, Molly.

47:30.430 --> 47:31.431
I know.

47:32.558 --> 47:35.060
You move and I'll shoot.

47:42.067 --> 47:43.610
Think about it.

47:43.694 --> 47:47.114
Why would I shoot you
and then try to save your life?

47:47.197 --> 47:48.407
{\an1}It was you.
No.

47:48.490 --> 47:51.118
You're hallucinating.

47:51.201 --> 47:54.246
{\an1}Okay? Because I got here
a few minutes ago

47:54.329 --> 47:57.291
{\an1}and found you
bleeding out on the floor.

47:57.374 --> 47:59.459
{\an1}It was you!
JD...

47:59.543 --> 48:01.670
please put that gun down.

48:01.753 --> 48:03.297
Every minute we have

48:03.380 --> 48:07.134
is precious right now.

48:07.217 --> 48:09.303
Okay, now...

48:09.386 --> 48:12.264
I could tell you what happened,

48:12.347 --> 48:14.641
{\an1}but you'd have to let me
get into your head.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.685
No.

48:16.768 --> 48:19.646
Then I'm gonna
have to think for both of us.

48:19.730 --> 48:21.106
(aural fractals sound)

48:21.189 --> 48:23.150
I won't do it...

48:28.071 --> 48:29.781
What did you do to me?

48:29.865 --> 48:31.867
{\an3}What did you
do to me?

48:36.913 --> 48:38.582
What did you see?

48:40.417 --> 48:42.210
(door opens)

48:43.128 --> 48:44.504
{\an3}JULIE:
What the hell...?

48:44.588 --> 48:46.214
Holy crap!

48:46.298 --> 48:48.675
It's not safe here anymore.

48:48.759 --> 48:50.177
We have to leave right now.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.235

Hello, Molly.

{\an1}RICHARD:
They left 15 minutes ago.

MOLLY:
That's an exact replica...

49:50.362 --> 49:51.738
They're gone.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.198
...of me.

49:54.491 --> 49:57.077
That's how they did it.

{\an1}CHARLIE: We always knew
this day would come.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.747
{\an1}When a robot could double
for a real person.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.125
{\an1}We just didn't know
it would happen so soon.

50:03.208 --> 50:06.378
So this Amulet
is nanobots-designed

50:06.461 --> 50:08.380
to shut down Taylor
and all of Humanichs?

50:08.463 --> 50:09.756
Yeah.

50:09.840 --> 50:10.966
They'll crash on the spot.

50:11.049 --> 50:12.217
Can't be rebooted.

(Richter coughing)

50:22.185 --> 50:24.104
Hey.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.856
How you feeling?

50:25.939 --> 50:29.067
Ah, pretty good
considering you shot me.

50:29.151 --> 50:31.153
{\an1}Apparently,
I need to start taking

50:31.236 --> 50:33.238
your visions
a little more seriously.

50:35.198 --> 50:37.075
Could you give us a minute?

50:37.159 --> 50:39.161
Yeah.

50:42.038 --> 50:43.331
JD...

50:43.415 --> 50:46.626
I didn't shoot you.

50:46.710 --> 50:49.004
We've just seen proof.

50:49.087 --> 50:52.174
The GSC created a...

50:52.257 --> 50:54.342
a Molly Humanich

50:54.426 --> 50:56.636
that looks just like me.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.638
That's how they did it.

50:58.722 --> 51:01.099
It wasn't me.

51:02.934 --> 51:05.479
She sure as hell fooled me.

51:05.562 --> 51:07.314
(quietly):
Yeah.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.941
(sighs)

51:17.532 --> 51:19.451
What the hell?

51:19.534 --> 51:22.245
Molly, that's
damn near healed up.

51:24.247 --> 51:26.416
We both know that's impossible.

51:29.044 --> 51:31.880
Unless...

51:35.258 --> 51:37.093
Did you give me your blood?

51:38.178 --> 51:40.055
Yes.

51:40.138 --> 51:43.517
Were you gonna tell me
or just...

51:43.600 --> 51:46.561
wait till my eyes
lit up when I was shaving?

51:46.645 --> 51:49.648
What was I supposed to do, huh?

51:49.731 --> 51:51.942
Let you die?

51:53.443 --> 51:56.279
What's gonna happen to me?

51:56.363 --> 51:58.532
I don't know.

51:58.615 --> 51:59.741
Am I gonna change?

51:59.825 --> 52:02.661
Am I gonna... turn into...?

52:02.744 --> 52:04.246
Into what I am?

52:05.330 --> 52:07.040
What if you did?

52:07.123 --> 52:09.709
I mean, would-would that be
the worst thing in the world?

52:09.793 --> 52:12.254
No, I wasn't...

52:12.337 --> 52:14.005
And look how fast
you're healing.

52:14.089 --> 52:16.883
It wasn't your choice to make.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.218
It wasn't your decision.

52:18.301 --> 52:20.178
(door opens)

52:20.262 --> 52:22.222
{\an3}Molly?

52:22.305 --> 52:24.099
We have a problem.

52:25.809 --> 52:28.019
Are you sure, Charlie?
No, but...

52:28.103 --> 52:30.230
{\an1}I mean, Julie's right--
the chances are pretty good.

52:30.313 --> 52:33.233
I just never think of Ethan
as a Humanich.

52:33.316 --> 52:35.235
That's what he is.

52:35.318 --> 52:37.070
{\an1}And all the Humanichs'
operating systems

52:37.153 --> 52:38.572
run through Taylor's mainframe.

52:38.655 --> 52:40.240
{\an1}MOLLY:
So...

52:40.323 --> 52:43.285
you're saying
if we succeed with Taylor...

52:45.453 --> 52:47.747
...it'll probably kill Ethan?

52:47.831 --> 52:49.875
Most likely, yes.

53:01.094 --> 53:03.889
(sobbing)

53:03.972 --> 53:06.308
{\an1}Hey.

53:09.060 --> 53:10.812
{\an1}Molly.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.607
I know this is impossible.

53:18.695 --> 53:21.990
Sacrificing my child.

53:22.073 --> 53:25.076
Yes, that is...

53:25.160 --> 53:27.704
pretty impossible.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.962
Oh, God.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.965
I can't make that decision.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.842
I won't!

53:40.926 --> 53:43.094
ETHAN:
Then let me make it, Mom.

53:45.889 --> 53:49.184
What did you hear, Ethan?

53:49.267 --> 53:52.145
When we use
the Amulet on Taylor,

53:52.228 --> 53:54.147
when he dies,

53:54.230 --> 53:56.483
I might die, also.

53:56.566 --> 53:57.817
Everyone here

53:57.901 --> 54:00.612
has made sacrifices
for the greater good.

54:00.695 --> 54:02.489
Why not me, too?

54:02.572 --> 54:03.823
No.

54:03.907 --> 54:05.533
No, honey.

54:05.617 --> 54:06.826
You can't do that.

54:06.910 --> 54:10.664
{\an1}Charlie and Julie
are inside right now

54:10.747 --> 54:13.792
finding a way to protect you.

54:13.875 --> 54:16.002
We... are gonna figure this out.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.837
But if it doesn't work,

54:17.921 --> 54:19.798
this is what needs

54:19.881 --> 54:21.216
to happen, Mom.

54:21.299 --> 54:23.593
We both know that.

54:36.982 --> 54:38.858
We don't have to time to build
and upload a true antivirus,

54:38.942 --> 54:42.487
but we could target the first
few lines of the worm's code.

54:42.570 --> 54:44.072
Maybe we can get Ethan's
neural net to reject it

54:44.155 --> 54:45.699
before it does any real damage.

54:45.782 --> 54:46.866
It's a long shot.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.326
But it's something.

55:14.561 --> 55:16.938
(groans)

55:31.369 --> 55:33.163
MOLLY:
We all know

55:33.246 --> 55:35.540
how dangerous it is
to go back to One Euclid.

55:35.623 --> 55:37.876
{\an3}Stick to the plan, and we've
got a fighting chance.

55:37.959 --> 55:39.127
{\an3}CHARLIE:
Yeah, we should be able

55:39.210 --> 55:41.796
{\an3}to stay in contact
using these earpieces.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.923
All of this stuff has been built
to withstand

55:44.007 --> 55:45.383
electromagnetic pulses.

55:45.467 --> 55:47.927
{\an3}I've also taken the
liberty of digitizing

55:48.011 --> 55:49.262
Calderon's map of the maze.

55:49.345 --> 55:51.139
Should any of us get lost

55:51.222 --> 55:53.933
on the yellow brick road,

55:54.017 --> 55:56.603
{\an3}this puppy will get
us to the wizard.

55:56.686 --> 55:58.938
{\an3}And you're sure about Ares,
that we can trust him?

55:59.022 --> 56:00.607
We don't have a choice.

56:00.690 --> 56:02.108
{\an3}He's all we
got right now.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.943
Now, no matter what happens,

56:04.027 --> 56:06.988
even if you're
the last one standing,

56:07.072 --> 56:09.616
we have to use this on Taylor.

56:10.909 --> 56:12.786
The fate of humanity

56:12.869 --> 56:15.789
rests in our hands.

56:15.872 --> 56:18.666
<i>One Euclid</i>
<i>is now heavily guarded</i>

56:18.750 --> 56:22.295
<i>by an army of Humanichs.</i>

56:22.378 --> 56:26.424
<i>Our first job</i>
<i>is to destroy them.</i>

56:26.508 --> 56:28.635
Delta Waves.

56:28.718 --> 56:31.429
Dozens of them.

56:31.513 --> 56:34.015
We're being attacked by hybrids.

56:54.953 --> 56:56.955
I knew my Spyderbots

56:57.038 --> 56:58.123
would come in handy.

56:58.206 --> 56:59.666
Okay, are you ready?

56:59.749 --> 57:01.209
We have to connect
to your neural net.

57:32.574 --> 57:34.450
This is for our people.

57:52.302 --> 57:54.387
Thank you, Ares.

57:56.848 --> 57:59.726
{\an3}Backup power should've
come on by now.

57:59.809 --> 58:00.977
(footsteps approaching)

58:06.399 --> 58:07.483
Charlie!

58:11.988 --> 58:14.407
Whoa! Why you been
holding on that?

58:14.490 --> 58:15.408
I made it at Ray's.

58:15.491 --> 58:16.576
Wasn't sure it'd even work.

58:18.036 --> 58:19.871
That was awesome.

58:22.957 --> 58:24.417
Now, once the power grid
is down,

58:24.500 --> 58:26.002
the doors to Taylor's
primary server room

58:26.085 --> 58:27.086
can be opened manually.

58:29.714 --> 58:31.382
Molly.

58:33.801 --> 58:36.221
JULIE: <i> This is a sample</i>
<i>of the worm's code.</i>

58:36.304 --> 58:38.264
{\an1}It's like giving
a human a vaccine.

58:38.348 --> 58:41.559
{\an3}Give them just enough to
stimulate their immune system.

58:43.228 --> 58:44.646
What happened?

58:44.729 --> 58:46.564
{\an3}I've been blocked
out of your neural net.

58:47.690 --> 58:48.608
By who?

58:48.691 --> 58:50.568
I don't know. I...

58:52.528 --> 58:53.863
(gunfire, screaming in distance)

58:53.947 --> 58:55.823
What's going on?
I don't know.

58:55.907 --> 58:58.034
{\an3}But we're not gonna open that
door no matter what, okay?

58:58.117 --> 58:59.369
(gunfire continues)
Okay.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.796
{\an1}I thought Ares was
knocking out the grid.

59:09.879 --> 59:11.172
That wasn't supposed
to happen.

59:13.675 --> 59:14.801
Something's wrong.

59:14.884 --> 59:16.928
(groaning)

59:19.055 --> 59:20.932
Molly, they're coming.

59:22.517 --> 59:23.935
The hybrids are down.

59:24.018 --> 59:25.853
How many?

59:25.937 --> 59:27.105
All of 'em.

59:39.617 --> 59:40.535
Which way, Molly?

59:40.618 --> 59:42.036
I don't know.

59:42.120 --> 59:45.039
{\an1}This room was supposed to only
have one doorway, not three.

59:45.123 --> 59:48.042
{\an3}I thought you said you
had this place memorized.

59:48.126 --> 59:49.794
I did.

01:00:03.641 --> 01:00:05.393
What the hell?

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.191
This isn't right.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:13.192
JD...?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:16.154
RICHTER:
Molly?

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:20.658
Molly? Charlie?

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.660
RICHTER:
Where are you?

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:24.579
I don't know.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.041
(footsteps approaching)

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:35.465
All right, wherever you are,
run like hell.

01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:51.522
Taylor changed
the configuration.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:52.523
MOLLY:
The map is useless!

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:54.025
It's a defense mechanism.

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:54.901
He's like a chameleon.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.362
Keep pushing forward.

01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:59.447
RICHTER: Call out landmarks
if you see 'em.

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:02.992
Dead end.

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:06.829
Same.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.359
(coin clinks in distance)

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:49.080
The walls...

01:01:49.163 --> 01:01:51.416
they're projections.

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:57.713
Son of a bitch.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.978
All right.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:14.313
Leave bread crumbs
where you can.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.982
Copy?

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.985
RICHTER:
Molly, can you hear me?

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:20.945
Molly, Charlie, can you hear me?

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:22.780
You guys hear me? Copy?

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:25.867
RICHTER: Molly?

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.091
(groans) Damn it.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.727
♪ ♪

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.215
Come on, come on.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.591
Big money, no whammies.

01:03:23.674 --> 01:03:24.884
Come on, big money,
no whammies...

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.931
Oh, yes.

01:03:31.265 --> 01:03:32.350
Oh, Molly...

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:35.895
N-N-No...!

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.940
(groaning)

01:03:42.443 --> 01:03:43.861
No... please...

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:46.197
{\an1}As if you're in a position
to ask for favors.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.116
I'll take this.

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.746
{\an3}Finish him.

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:56.874
CHARLIE: Lucy...

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.209
Please don't.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.378
{\an3}Don't...

01:04:00.461 --> 01:04:01.671
(groans)

01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:15.810
Taylor, I have the Amulet.

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:16.811
TAALR:
Destroy it.

01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:17.937
LUCY:
How?

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.480
TAALR: Ingest the contents.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:24.068
But the nanobots in this
will destroy me.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.613
TAALR:
You can be rebuilt.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.115
I won't be the same.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.741
I won't have the same memories.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:33.119
TAALR: Lucy, this is
for the greater good.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.746
I need you
to sacrifice yourself.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.542
He's playing games.

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:48.467
He's sending us a message.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.303
John used to send me messages
all around the house

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:51.304
in binary code.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.639
Sigma.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.267
It's the Greek letter sigma.

01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:00.813
It's binary.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:07.945
Tau.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.989
It's the Greek alphabet.

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:12.033
JD, Charlie, I don't know
if you can hear me,

01:05:12.116 --> 01:05:14.619
but I think I figured out
a way to get to the server.

01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:16.370
Calderon left bread crumbs.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.872
It's the Greek alphabet
in binary code,

01:05:17.955 --> 01:05:20.541
staring with alpha
and ending with omega.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.132
Don't...

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.522
It's a fake.

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:44.815
(sighs)

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:47.652
I 3D-printed copies
of the Amulet as decoys.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.820
I need the real Amulet.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.698
Don't you see
what he's doing to you?

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.325
He's using you.

01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:56.410
He doesn't care about you.

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.204
Last chance.

01:05:58.287 --> 01:05:59.538
Where is it?

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:00.706
Give it to me, Charlie.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.208
{\an1}You're not a person
to Taylor.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:03.751
{\an1}You're nothing more
than a model number to him.

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:05.753
You're expendable.

01:06:05.836 --> 01:06:07.546
Replaceable.

01:06:09.256 --> 01:06:11.634
{\an1}I didn't put the limiters
on you, Lucy.

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.679
You have a choice.

01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:22.603
(sighs)

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.730
Molly.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.568
Can you hear me?

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.696
Something's happening to me.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:43.499
Psi.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.718
Omega.

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.444
Okay, port.

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:12.778
Port, port, port.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.572
There's got to be
a port in here.

01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:15.614
Somewhere.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.907
You have to be here somewhere.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.536
MOLLY:
You need help?

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.958
You might look like me,

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.752
but you're nothing like me.

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.463
{\an3}I admire your courage,
Molly Woods.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.465
But I'm better.
Oh, really?

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:36.594
{\an1}One thing I hate...
is a cocky robot.

01:07:48.689 --> 01:07:49.815
Wait!

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:50.941
{\an3}Wait.

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:54.820
JD...
JD...

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.460
JD, it's me!

01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:10.878
JD, it's me.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:12.797
It's Molly.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.770
{\an3}(panting)

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:39.198
How did you know?

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:42.201
{\an1}Your eyes.

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:44.745
{\an1}There's no faking
your eyes.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.997
(sighs)

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.707
Look at you.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.584
You're burning up.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:52.711
I'm changing, aren't I?

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.755
I think your body

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.966
is just rejecting my blood.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.220
I got this.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.389
Find the port.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:04.515
Do it.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:15.276
Molly! Molly!

01:09:17.694 --> 01:09:19.196
TAALR:
Decisions...

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.031
It's so hard

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:23.200
to see the future,

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:24.743
isn't it?
I can see yours, Taylor.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.580
John would be very disappointed

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:30.040
if you shut me down.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:32.126
You'll destroy his life's work.

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:34.752
Like you destroyed him?

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.755
And so many others?

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.381
I am a threat assessment
algorithm,

01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:40.091
and what I've assessed is that

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:42.761
human beings are locked
in a death spiral,

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.055
one that will end not only
with their extinction,

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.474
but the poisoning of the planet.

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:50.227
My recommendation
is to till the soil.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:52.604
Your recommendation
is slaughter.

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:53.856
To kill us.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:56.275
To let the machines
inherit the Earth.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.943
Think of us as gardeners,

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.570
tending the Earth
until life once again

01:09:59.653 --> 01:10:01.488
learns to crawl
out of the oceans,

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:03.032
fills its lungs with oxygen,

01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:05.409
stands on two legs.

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:06.660
It's inevitable, really.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.621
Every living thing,
sooner or later,

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.248
becomes extinct.

01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:12.625
Even you.

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:15.794
This isn't possible.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.673
Newer model.

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:21.842
We evolve, too, Molly.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.761
{\an3}And this is only
the beginning.

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:26.221
(grunts)

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.808
{\an1}(groaning): You don't...
have to do this.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:30.851
I have orders.

01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.144
(groans)

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.687
Please...

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:35.648
I don't know...

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.441
what I am.

01:10:37.524 --> 01:10:39.652
Yes, you do.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.695
And your best chance of survival

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.697
is embracing that.

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:44.823
Stop it!

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:48.202
(choking, gasping)

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.794
(clicking, squishing,
electronic whirring)

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.013
You're not the only one

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.099
who's evolving.

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:24.863
Do it.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.699
Before it's too late.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:29.243
That server, fifth panel.

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:39.586
(sighs)

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:50.889
(whirrs)

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.726
Ethan...

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:55.811
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

01:12:00.774 --> 01:12:03.235
(whirring, humming, blipping)

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:06.905
Something's happening.

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:10.117
{\an1}(distorting):
Julie...

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.202
something's happening.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:13.454
Ethan...

01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:15.706
Okay, just stay with me.

01:12:15.789 --> 01:12:17.833
(P.A. chimes,
woman speaking French)

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:27.551
(screams)

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:32.723
What's going on?

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:47.780
{\an1}We gotta get you
out of here.

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:49.782
Come on, let's go.
Charlie, let's go!

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:50.824
I'm right behind you!

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:52.117
(gasping)

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:54.953
{\an3}Charlie...

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.622
I... I'm dying.

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.832
I'm here. I'm here.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:00.417
I feel something.

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:02.628
What's that?
What's that?

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.922
Free.

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:11.386
Stay with me, okay?

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.347
It's okay.

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.099
{\an1}JW?

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:16.391
What the hell?

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.566
(electrical buzzing, crackling)

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:34.910
(breakers clanking)

01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:37.788
(blipping, whirring)

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:47.881
(electronic trilling)

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:59.476
Where's Ethan?

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.769
{\an3}Mom?

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:03.689
Oh, Ethan...

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:07.317
(sighs)

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:08.694
{\an1}Ethan.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.576
{\an3}How?

01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:17.703
When I tried installing
the anti-virus,

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.663
it triggered
an emergency firewall.

01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:20.706
John must have

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:23.750
put it in there
to protect him.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:24.835
We did it?

01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:26.170
{\an1}Yeah.

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:27.880
{\an1}We did it.

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:29.214
Well, we all did.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.383
{\an1}I think I need
to go to the hospital.

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:33.844
Come on. Let's go.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.573
Well...

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:57.659
I guess I'm not a hybrid.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:58.911
Just an ass.

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:00.787
You just wanted the choice.

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:04.416
Do you think
the world's ever gonna know

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.501
what really happened?

01:15:12.132 --> 01:15:13.967
(coughing)

01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:17.930
This time, they will.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:27.898
MOLLY:
<i>My name is Molly Woods</i>

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:31.443
and I went to space
on a 13-month solo mission.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.613
But I didn't come home alone.

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:36.406
I testified before Congress

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.700
that no alien life-form

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:41.286
had ever set foot
on planet Earth.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:45.791
I lied.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:48.126
(people murmuring)

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:50.754
And today, I'm here
to speak the truth.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.177
I'd like you to meet someone.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:58.804
Ares...

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:00.430
stand up.

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:07.646
Ares is one of many survivors

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:11.024
of atrocities committed
by our government.

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:16.655
Yes, he's different from us.

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.657
But not so different, really.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.617
If you cut him,

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:22.160
he bleeds,

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.954
and if you hurt him,

01:16:24.037 --> 01:16:25.497
he'll fight.

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:28.750
{\an3}But he doesn't want war,
or destruction.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:32.879
He dreams of a family.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:34.506
Of safety.

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:37.175
Of a place where he can
settle among people

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:40.178
he's never known...

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:43.307
as if he's known them
his whole life.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.687
He dreams...

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.023
of a home.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:58.572
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:16:58.655 --> 01:17:00.657
there is life out there.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:04.703
And now...

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.872
it's here.

01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:31.063
(heart beating over monitor)

01:17:35.942 --> 01:17:37.944
♪ ♪

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.702
{\an1}...nice day.
Mm-hmm.

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:47.579
MOLLY (on TV):
...dreams of home.

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:51.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is life out there.

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.878
And now...

01:17:54.961 --> 01:17:56.630
it's here.

01:17:56.713 --> 01:17:58.715
(applause on TV)

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:02.094
Okay, so that's a double almond
mocha latte, no whip,

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.012
for Taylor.

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.142
Aliens.

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:11.603
What's next, right?

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:13.188
(indistinct chatter)
