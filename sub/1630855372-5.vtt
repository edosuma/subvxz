00:11.929 --> 00:14.306
Hi, my name is Armond Collins,

00:14.306 --> 00:19.144
and I'm committed
to the University of Southern California.

00:41.542 --> 00:46.380
I'm Tyriq Williams, and I'm taking
my talents to the University of Virginia.

01:07.484 --> 01:12.948
My name is Ramel Evans,

01:12.948 --> 01:18.495
and I'm going to be playing for the CBA...

01:20.622 --> 01:23.417
in China.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.531
Hey, what's up? My name is Deandre Wright.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.952
I may go to the University of Texas
or Georgetown.

01:59.703 --> 02:00.746
Or Indiana State.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.539
I'll let y'all know.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.584
Do you all know who I am?

02:06.335 --> 02:07.461
Do you all know who I am?

02:07.461 --> 02:10.214
Get off of me, man, please!

02:10.214 --> 02:11.507
This ain't right.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.134
Get off of me!

02:14.134 --> 02:15.385
Let me go!

02:17.971 --> 02:21.475
Let me go. Let me go, man.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.141
Crys, you good?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.479
I don't even know what that means anymore.

04:33.649 --> 04:34.691
I feel you.

04:39.154 --> 04:44.451
Last night, Phil, Drew and Musa
made an announcement.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.663
I heard.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.414
They're my henchmen.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.210
You know, y'all are so stupid, right?

04:54.211 --> 04:56.588
I wouldn't say that,
but we definitely not smart.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.637
Your post on IG made you famous.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.265
A million views for calling people out.

05:06.265 --> 05:11.144
Everyone acts
like what happened to me is a joke.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.815
It isn't.

05:15.858 --> 05:16.942
Never was.

05:22.948 --> 05:25.367
We got this community service game today.

05:25.951 --> 05:30.205
Something set up through Coach Ike
and Meg's Swagger DMV program.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.710
School doesn't have their hands on it,
so I can play.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.672
If we all don't end up suspended
from Cedar Cove basketball,

05:38.672 --> 05:41.049
today could be
our last time hooping together.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.177
What about the legal stuff?

05:44.428 --> 05:47.222
My mother's spearheading
a letter campaign to the DA.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.517
Gladiator Sneakers got us
a really dope lawyer.

05:51.435 --> 05:54.479
And I'm trying not to be tight
about all of it.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.023
That's good, Jace.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.528
I gotta go.

06:06.491 --> 06:10.329
Speaking of being famous,
saw your sex tape online.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.706
Kissing video?

06:13.916 --> 06:16.084
Anyway, that's old news.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.337
What? She broke your heart or something?

06:19.338 --> 06:23.258
Believe me, if I want my heart broken,
I know exactly where to go.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.761
What's that supposed to mean?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.098
Excuse me?

06:30.766 --> 06:34.019
After sophomore year, you were the one
who said you needed space.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.355
I said that because you said
you needed time

06:36.355 --> 06:38.524
to focus on taking your game
to the next level.

06:44.571 --> 06:49.576
But I'm glad things
are going so amazingly well with--

06:49.576 --> 06:51.286
- Roderick.
- Right.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.164
Yeah. It's been a little hectic.

06:54.164 --> 06:58.043
So him and I decided to take a break.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.804
There has been a lot of heat on us.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.598
Not everyone can handle it.

07:15.853 --> 07:16.854
Ball out, okay?

07:18.188 --> 07:19.189
Always.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.756
- Morning, Coach Meg.
- Morning.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.758
- Coach Ike.
- Morning, Mus.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.303
Hop on the bus. First come, first serve.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.310
Thank you.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.528
<i>Your dad and I talked about it.</i>

08:06.528 --> 08:08.822
We don't feel good about you going.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.450
It doesn't matter
if the school sanctioned it.

08:12.743 --> 08:13.744
This is my team.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.747
And if there's any time
to stand with them, it's now.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.749
They're playing
an exhibition game at a prison.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.835
And by the end of the week,
some of them might end up there.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.922
- It's a detention center.
- It is a sinking ship.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.181
The answer is no.

08:35.599 --> 08:36.808
Bus is leaving in ten.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.477
We've talked about this.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.686
And it doesn't make sense.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.438
I'm not comfortable
with that group of individuals.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.734
- That group of individuals are my friends.
- I'm not comfortable with that either.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.110
And that's your problem.

08:48.612 --> 08:49.988
I'm going to play.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.908
I did not sign that consent form,

08:53.492 --> 08:54.326
and I don't intend to.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.246
This is bullshit.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.292
How are we even able
to afford an attorney, Ma?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.418
We can't.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.589
But Alonzo from Gladiator Sneakers,
he's taking care of it.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.801
He just asked us to keep it quiet.

09:17.766 --> 09:18.725
Hey, Ma.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.228
It's all gonna be okay.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.650
Yeah, it is.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.748
I agree with your decision to stay home.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.586
Nicholas, sometimes you have to do
what's best for the team.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.423
But sometimes you have to do
what's best for you.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.316
What's up, homey?

10:20.329 --> 10:23.081
The other players either canceled
or didn't respond to my text.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.297
Our starting five is on the bus.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.470
I know we said we'd be there.

10:37.262 --> 10:41.308
I'm just triple-checking
that we feel all right about this timing.

10:41.892 --> 10:42.809
I think it's necessary.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.729
I don't know what to think.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.819
Maybe it's something the kids need.

10:54.279 --> 10:57.866
With all due respect,
I know what my kid needs.

11:00.869 --> 11:01.787
Let's do this.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.288
Okay.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.216
Hey, hold on.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.689
What's up, Coach?

11:33.610 --> 11:34.736
What's up, Royale?

11:41.159 --> 11:42.035
Okay.

11:49.710 --> 11:53.005
Our athletic director is not exactly
my biggest fan.

11:53.005 --> 11:54.047
Need a tissue?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.843
Not shedding tears, but he may fire me.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.803
Can't say I'd miss working with him,

11:59.803 --> 12:02.681
but I would miss that big-ass house
he got me and Tonya.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.018
Me too.

13:04.368 --> 13:05.786
We appreciate y'all visiting.

13:06.495 --> 13:09.456
Just got to let Betty do her job here. Search.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.668
Let's go. Search.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.006
Go on.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.945
- Wait a second, I know you.
- Hey.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.448
- I'm Phil Marksby, Mr. Carlos.
- Nice to know you, Mr. Phil.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.658
- Pleasure to meet you.
- All right.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.286
- Hello, Mr. Carlos. I'm Jace Carson.
- How you doing, brother?

13:47.286 --> 13:48.787
- Good.
- What's up, man?

13:48.787 --> 13:49.913
What's going on there, Ikey?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.624
Man, I ain't seen you since
you was knee-high to a grasshopper.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.127
Man, how's the family doing?

13:55.127 --> 13:57.087
- Everybody's good, sir. Everybody's good.
- Fantastic.

13:57.087 --> 14:00.465
Everybody, this is John Carlos, okay?

14:00.465 --> 14:02.968
- Yeah.
- He was in the 1968 Olympics.

14:03.552 --> 14:07.514
Now, I want y'all to go ahead,
take a look at this.

14:10.434 --> 14:14.313
This man is a hero to many of us.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.108
Left fist in the air
during the national anthem.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.194
He loved his country enough
to challenge it.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.572
Okay,
so go ahead and introduce yourselves.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.867
- Dr. Carlos, Naim Rahaim.
- All right, brother? All right.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.702
- Musa Rahaim. It's an honor, sir.
- Yeah.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.579
- Drew Murphy, sir.
- All right, brother.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.581
- Royale Hughes.
- Nice to know you, brother.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.625
- Nick Mendez. Thank you for everything.
- All right, Nick.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.335
- Megan Bailey.
- Thank you, Coach.

14:36.919 --> 14:40.088
All right. Now,
I'd like to pose a question to you guys.

14:40.088 --> 14:44.218
What is the largest mental health
provider in the United States?

14:47.304 --> 14:48.222
Yes, sir, Phil.

14:48.222 --> 14:50.265
- Prisons.
- Absolutely correct.

14:50.265 --> 14:54.394
There's prisons. There's jails.
And there's detention centers.

14:54.394 --> 14:59.191
In this country, the majority of people
with mental illness are behind bars.

14:59.191 --> 15:04.446
We also incarcerate more people per capita
than any other country in the world.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.864
And at this day and time,

15:06.365 --> 15:10.577
there are more Black people
in the penitentiaries across this nation

15:10.577 --> 15:14.915
than there were Black people enslaved
before the Civil War.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.837
The prison system
has become the new plantation.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.547
Does that sound like a problem?

15:21.547 --> 15:22.881
- Yeah.
- Absolutely, sir.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.550
Now, these young men out there

15:24.550 --> 15:26.552
that you guys
are going to play against today,

15:26.552 --> 15:30.264
it's been buzzing around about--
They out here to kick y'all ass.

15:32.808 --> 15:34.893
So in turn, I want you guys to think

15:34.893 --> 15:38.981
about the same premise
of kicking their asses.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.524
All right?

15:40.524 --> 15:43.777
All right, guys, I want you to remember
this when you go into the game today:

15:43.777 --> 15:45.362
Winners are made on the court.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.740
Champions are made off the court.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.034
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.621
Now we're going to turn the program
over to Sergeant Hampton.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.206
- Hello.
- Hello. Hi.

15:56.707 --> 16:00.294
The Maryland Youth Facility
houses male incarcerated people

16:00.294 --> 16:02.379
from the ages of 13 to 17.

16:02.379 --> 16:06.049
None of the people you'll interact with
today will have weapons of any kind,

16:06.049 --> 16:08.135
and you will only be interacting
with the young men

16:08.135 --> 16:09.928
who have exhibited good behavior.

16:09.928 --> 16:13.515
I'm gonna split you off into groups
and let you visit various classrooms.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.017
As Mr. Carlos mentioned,

16:15.017 --> 16:17.603
we want our young men
to have college in their future,

16:17.603 --> 16:20.981
so you are encouraged to engage.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.525
- All right?
- All right.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.402
- Thank you.
- Let's get you all processed.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.948
Thank you.

16:29.948 --> 16:33.118
Phil Marksby, Musa Rahaim,
Drew Murphy, and not to mention,

16:33.118 --> 16:35.329
Jace Carson, got on the biggest stage
they could find

16:35.329 --> 16:38.081
and in one swoop embarrassed Cedar Cove.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.419
Four of our starters
could end up in jail or on probation.

16:42.419 --> 16:45.839
And you, my friend,
bear much of the responsibility.

16:46.548 --> 16:47.758
How am I involved?

16:48.884 --> 16:51.303
You convinced the board
for me to hire Ike as head coach.

16:51.303 --> 16:52.679
Were he a better role model,

16:53.180 --> 16:55.724
this whole thing
could have been contained.

16:55.724 --> 16:56.892
So it's safe to assume

16:56.892 --> 16:59.603
that you're considering
the pros and cons of expulsion.

17:00.646 --> 17:02.439
This institution is bigger than the kids.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.107
Nothing is bigger than the kids.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.486
This institution is bigger
than those four kids.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.656
I assume, like us,
you have others to save.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.415
The governing board of
the Maryland Unified Athletic Council

17:21.415 --> 17:23.126
should take the lead on this.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.753
Look, you and me both know
how restrictive they are.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.590
How buttoned up
they want their athletes to be.

17:29.174 --> 17:33.679
If Cedar Cove expels the Cedar Cove Four,
as they're being called,

17:33.679 --> 17:36.348
or if Gladiator pulls their sponsorship,

17:37.432 --> 17:39.977
that's bad PR for the both of us. But--

17:39.977 --> 17:42.855
You're proposing
we let the MUA be the bad guys.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.110
They analyze the series of events,
make a ruling concerning their future play

17:49.736 --> 17:50.696
and we follow suit?

17:50.696 --> 17:54.032
I think following their
conservative recommendations

17:54.032 --> 17:55.200
may be a better way to lead.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.539
I thought your sympathies lay
with the Swagger players.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.667
They do, 100%.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.423
But as you said,
there are others to save, right?

18:57.930 --> 19:00.390
"What happens to a dream deferred?

19:01.141 --> 19:04.603
Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?

19:05.604 --> 19:08.815
Or fester like a sore-- And then run?

19:10.275 --> 19:12.402
Does it stink like rotten meat?

19:13.320 --> 19:17.449
Or crust and sugar over--
like a syrupy sweet?

19:19.076 --> 19:21.662
Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.748
Or does it explode?"

19:26.667 --> 19:29.211
What do you think Langston Hughes
is trying to say with that poem?

19:29.837 --> 19:34.216
If people don't get opportunities
or figure their lives out,

19:34.216 --> 19:35.342
their dreams can go away.

19:35.926 --> 19:39.888
And when your dreams go away,
shit can get crazy for you.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.056
You're already crazy.

19:41.557 --> 19:42.724
Settle down.

19:45.686 --> 19:46.728
Thank you.

19:47.646 --> 19:50.774
I noticed one of our visitors
is pretty adept with Langston Hughes.

19:50.774 --> 19:51.859
Am I right?

19:54.736 --> 19:56.655
Sorry. Yes.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.367
My mother used to read his poems to me

20:01.368 --> 20:05.914
when she was locked up.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.667
If you don't mind me asking,
how long was she incarcerated?

20:09.793 --> 20:10.627
Two years.

20:12.713 --> 20:15.799
Do you remember any lines
from one of the poems?

20:15.799 --> 20:18.010
- I think I might.
- We'd love to hear it.

20:18.552 --> 20:19.803
Come join us.

20:35.611 --> 20:39.281
"Well, son, I'll tell you:

20:41.742 --> 20:44.870
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.

20:47.623 --> 20:48.707
It's had tacks in it...

20:51.835 --> 20:52.961
and splinters,

20:54.129 --> 20:55.339
and boards torn up,

20:56.173 --> 20:58.050
places with no carpet on the floor.

20:58.926 --> 20:59.927
But all the time

21:01.428 --> 21:02.679
I'se been a-climbin' on

21:04.348 --> 21:05.682
and reachin' landin's...

21:07.851 --> 21:09.394
and turnin' corners,

21:10.187 --> 21:13.857
and sometimes goin' in the dark

21:15.317 --> 21:16.985
where there ain't been no light."

21:27.621 --> 21:31.542
"So boy, don't you turn back.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.795
Don't you set down on those steps

21:34.795 --> 21:35.963
'cause it's kinda hard.

21:35.963 --> 21:37.339
Don't you fall now...

21:40.384 --> 21:41.885
for I'se still goin', honey.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.263
I'se still climbin',

21:44.263 --> 21:49.142
and for me,
life ain't been no crystal stair."

22:01.113 --> 22:03.198
Well done. Thank you.

22:24.094 --> 22:25.679
Our students are future scientists.

22:25.679 --> 22:29.141
They'll be gardening,
working with solar power,

22:29.141 --> 22:31.143
and this semester, they're working
with bee colonies

22:31.143 --> 22:32.853
and understanding how bees help the earth.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.313
That's amazing.

22:34.313 --> 22:36.815
The biggest de-escalator to violence
in this detention center

22:36.815 --> 22:38.483
has been the classes we've offered.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.831
Is it all right? He played for me.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.090
- How you doing, Coach?
- It's good to see you, Vince.

23:02.674 --> 23:05.761
- What up, Drew? Boy.
- Real good to see you, Vince.

23:08.222 --> 23:09.223
Hey.

23:11.767 --> 23:12.851
I tried reaching you.

23:15.395 --> 23:19.483
Look, I'm sorry. I know.

23:21.985 --> 23:25.364
That is why you must challenge
each claim and not each person.

23:28.158 --> 23:31.286
Class, we have some visitors today
from Cedar Cove Prep.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.412
Let's welcome them.

23:34.289 --> 23:35.457
Hey.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.962
So, which one of you is the star
on the debate team?

23:40.546 --> 23:43.173
- Star?
- That would be Royale.

23:44.550 --> 23:48.011
This is a rare treat for us.
You see, this is our debate class,

23:48.011 --> 23:50.848
and we never get the opportunity
to debate with someone of your stature.

23:51.515 --> 23:54.059
Hold on.
I think there is some kind of confusion.

23:54.059 --> 23:56.812
I just joined the debate team
this semester and I'm an alternate,

23:56.812 --> 23:58.564
but somebody quit.
So now I'm first speaker.

23:58.564 --> 24:01.108
- But I don't think it's--
- Even an alternate at Cedar Cove is elite.

24:02.025 --> 24:05.028
It really would be a rare treat for you
to debate one of our students.

24:05.529 --> 24:06.613
What do you say, Cedar Cove?

24:07.614 --> 24:10.909
- Ce--
- I don't think he's exactly asking.

24:13.871 --> 24:14.705
Yeah.

24:40.397 --> 24:43.567
All right.
You've been given your prep notes.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.319
The debate topic is:

24:45.819 --> 24:50.699
America's Independence Day
should be January 1st, 1863,

24:50.699 --> 24:53.577
the date that
the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.

24:53.577 --> 24:56.246
Royale Hughes has opted
for the affirmative.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.124
Royale, the floor is yours.

25:04.171 --> 25:10.010
Resolved. America's Independence Day
should be January 1st, 1863,

25:10.010 --> 25:12.221
when the Emancipation Proclamation
was signed.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.014
According to the Library of Congress,

25:14.014 --> 25:18.018
on July 4th, 1776,
the Declaration of Independence announced

25:18.018 --> 25:19.811
the colonies' separation
from Great Britain.

25:19.811 --> 25:23.190
The decree was,
"All men are created equal."

25:24.274 --> 25:29.279
However, all men and women did not have
the legal right to be treated equally.

25:31.114 --> 25:34.493
According to the National Archives,
on January 1st, 1863,

25:35.452 --> 25:37.788
the Emancipation Proclamation
was announced.

25:38.455 --> 25:42.459
Thousands of enslaved people attained
their freedom in an unjust society

25:42.459 --> 25:44.127
where we were told we were barely human.

25:44.127 --> 25:46.380
African Americans
walked off the plantations

25:46.380 --> 25:49.550
and walked away from their "slave owners."

25:49.550 --> 25:53.053
The Pittsburgh Courier reports
that we were legally emancipated.

25:54.304 --> 25:57.808
But we were still mistreated,
denied our rights.

25:58.559 --> 26:01.395
In fact, we were denied
the information of our own freedom.

26:04.189 --> 26:10.279
However, we do not mark this date
because emancipation was finally realized.

26:11.029 --> 26:14.324
We mark this date because emancipation
was finally proclaimed.

26:16.368 --> 26:17.202
Thank you.

26:21.164 --> 26:22.165
Marcus Johnson.

26:33.051 --> 26:36.138
When I get released next month,
it'll be bittersweet.

26:37.431 --> 26:41.935
I mean, let's face it, I won't have to sit
next to Gary and deal with his bad breath.

26:49.443 --> 26:53.197
But my brother is in this institution.

26:55.199 --> 26:58.994
Like, literally, my biological brother
is sitting right there.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.582
See, I'm being released
due to good behavior.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.375
He isn't.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.881
And when I go home, my mother will hug me.

27:12.090 --> 27:13.842
But there will still be a hole
in her heart

27:14.343 --> 27:16.220
because her other son
never walked through that door.

27:17.262 --> 27:21.058
When our so-called emancipation
was proclaimed,

27:21.058 --> 27:23.602
thousands of African Americans
were never told.

27:23.602 --> 27:27.356
News never reached them.
And it was deliberate.

27:27.356 --> 27:32.861
On June 19th, 1865, two and a half years
after the Emancipation was proclaimed,

27:33.403 --> 27:37.407
enslaved Africans in Texas learned
of their freedom for the very first time.

27:39.159 --> 27:43.872
Now, my opponent is correct that while
America was free of British rule in 1776,

27:44.581 --> 27:46.083
all of America was not.

27:47.251 --> 27:51.588
He contradicts himself by suggesting that
we celebrate the Emancipation Proclamation

27:51.588 --> 27:53.006
as part of our independence,

27:53.006 --> 27:56.176
knowing that many of us
were denied that very same proclamation.

27:58.846 --> 28:01.348
Now, is this not in fact,
just like my brother and I?

28:06.061 --> 28:08.772
You see, as long as my little brother
is in this place...

28:10.774 --> 28:12.025
I won't truly be free.

28:14.903 --> 28:19.032
And until Black Americans learned word
on June 19th, they weren't either.

28:20.951 --> 28:23.912
That is the date of our true independence.

28:25.706 --> 28:31.503
Because we can't proclaim freedom
until we all proclaim freedom.

28:33.338 --> 28:35.424
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

28:42.139 --> 28:46.185
All right. Quiet down, please. Quiet down.

28:48.729 --> 28:50.731
I see that some of you feel
that Marcus has won.

28:50.731 --> 28:52.024
Hell yeah.

28:54.193 --> 28:57.446
Like everything in life,
it is not just about the passion.

28:57.988 --> 28:59.865
You must also be disciplined.

28:59.865 --> 29:04.494
You must be prepared,
and you must know the rules.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.747
Marcus, did you cite any research?

29:07.247 --> 29:08.957
I was citing myself.

29:10.417 --> 29:13.378
So you didn't cite any of the research
provided in the prep notes?

29:14.546 --> 29:18.592
Your closing line, "We can't proclaim
freedom until we all proclaim freedom."

29:18.592 --> 29:19.968
Who were you citing?

29:19.968 --> 29:21.595
Marcus Johnson.

29:22.846 --> 29:26.850
Excuse me, Mr. Miller.
I thought Marcus was brilliant.

29:26.850 --> 29:29.853
He is.

29:32.731 --> 29:38.403
And yet the victory goes to you,
Mr. Royale Hughes.

29:50.749 --> 29:53.252
I wanna thank Camden and Margarite
for having us all over.

29:54.253 --> 29:58.131
We have made great progress at Cedar Cove.

29:58.131 --> 30:00.092
We have two African American teachers,

30:00.092 --> 30:02.886
one Latinx teacher,
and an Asian American teacher.

30:02.886 --> 30:05.138
We have a African American
athletics director,

30:05.138 --> 30:07.599
a African American basketball coach,

30:07.599 --> 30:10.644
and a African American
diversity and inclusion counselor.

30:10.644 --> 30:14.940
When my daughter started as a freshman, we
didn't have one African American teacher.

30:15.482 --> 30:18.652
In fact, we didn't have a Spanish teacher
teaching Spanish.

30:22.364 --> 30:26.910
But now, we must continue to be leaders
for our children in the community.

30:27.536 --> 30:31.456
And unfortunately, that means we must talk
about our four basketball players

30:31.456 --> 30:33.375
who have confessed to criminal activity.

30:33.375 --> 30:34.793
The Cedar Cove Four.

30:35.586 --> 30:38.297
Well, hold on, Nina.
They weren't selling drugs.

30:39.089 --> 30:40.883
They were, as I understand it,

30:41.383 --> 30:45.179
14 years old, defending a young lady
who was being abused.

30:45.179 --> 30:47.389
But, they attacked him in an alley.

30:47.389 --> 30:49.349
They nearly beat the man to death,

30:49.349 --> 30:52.895
and Jenna Carson wants us
to write letters on their behalf.

30:52.895 --> 30:57.191
I mean, have you seen the video?
It's quite disturbing. What--

31:03.155 --> 31:06.283
Now I know why I'm always too busy
to come to your meetings.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.912
You don't know anything about my son.

31:09.912 --> 31:14.833
No one was looking to offend you, Jenna.
People were just talking freely.

31:15.918 --> 31:20.047
I'd love to talk freely
to you bougie-ass Jack and Jill wannabes.

31:20.714 --> 31:24.510
Jace Carson is a B-plus student.

31:25.677 --> 31:30.557
He goes to practice after school
and he practices after practice,

31:30.557 --> 31:31.975
and he still has to study.

31:32.559 --> 31:36.480
And it's not just his work ethic
that makes him a damn good human being,

31:36.480 --> 31:37.564
it's his heart.

31:38.899 --> 31:41.318
And his love for his friends.

31:42.486 --> 31:47.699
You have no damn idea what he's been
through in his life to be where he's at.

31:48.867 --> 31:51.954
You can talk about his teammate
all you want.

31:51.954 --> 31:56.083
You can talk about him all you want.
You can talk about me all you want.

31:57.334 --> 32:00.921
And while you at it,
you highfalutin brothers and sisters,

32:00.921 --> 32:03.507
don't forget to kiss my Black ass.

32:03.507 --> 32:05.717
Jenna, hold on. Hold up. Hold-- Jenna.

32:05.717 --> 32:07.845
- Jenna, hold on. Come on. Hold up.
- She didn't have to go there.

32:08.804 --> 32:09.638
Hold on.

32:09.638 --> 32:10.722
You ain't no better than the rest of them.

32:10.722 --> 32:14.017
Wait. Hold on, sister. There's no need
for you to get so riled up.

32:14.017 --> 32:14.977
Excuse me?

32:15.686 --> 32:18.772
We're all here because we wanna
do right by our kids.

32:19.439 --> 32:22.818
Okay? Believe it or not,
I care about everyone's kids.

32:23.819 --> 32:25.028
I care about your kid.

32:26.530 --> 32:31.118
He's been good to my son.
He's looked out for CJ.

32:32.786 --> 32:34.371
Thank you. I appreciate that.

32:34.872 --> 32:35.873
Yeah.

32:36.915 --> 32:40.252
Now, unfortunately,
because of everything that's transpired,

32:42.045 --> 32:46.091
I don't think it'll be likely that things
will work out for him at Cedar Cove.

32:46.091 --> 32:49.428
But just let me make a couple calls,

32:50.053 --> 32:54.057
see if I can help him to land
somewhere that's gonna be a good fit.

34:05.087 --> 34:06.255
Hey, Grandma.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.091
Did you send the highlight reel
to the coach?

34:09.757 --> 34:11.176
And Shaun put a track to it?

34:11.969 --> 34:15.013
No cussing, right? I don't want
no cussing and shit on my highlight reel.

34:15.931 --> 34:16.931
Yes, ma'am.

34:18.641 --> 34:19.685
I'll watch my mouth.

34:22.396 --> 34:23.688
After today's game,

34:24.982 --> 34:27.943
we're gonna be able to tell him
I lit up Swagger.

34:28.569 --> 34:31.237
I will. Love you too.

34:41.123 --> 34:44.126
Y'all ready to run me that?

34:44.126 --> 34:46.210
Man, y'all going to get y'all asses beat.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.629
Put some money on it then.

34:47.629 --> 34:51.842
I bet you a bag of Flaming Hots
and a case of Oreos, y'all lose.

34:52.801 --> 34:53.802
Nah, man.

34:53.802 --> 34:57.222
See, how about we bet
a week's worth of phone time?

34:57.890 --> 35:02.102
If we win, y'all transfer
that money into my account.

35:02.769 --> 35:06.231
If y'all win, I'll do the same.

35:06.899 --> 35:08.358
Aight, bet.

35:08.942 --> 35:10.861
It's done.

35:20.871 --> 35:21.872
What do you think?

35:26.376 --> 35:27.377
It's beautiful.

35:28.003 --> 35:29.171
It's gonna rain.

35:32.049 --> 35:33.133
It looks sunny, man.

35:34.218 --> 35:38.889
I love the rain. Rain washes it away,
and we get to start all over again.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.230
It was nice to meet you, Nico.

35:56.073 --> 35:58.992
You know, the last couple of schools
we had come over,

35:58.992 --> 36:01.161
their coaches and Mr. Carlos
actually swapped.

36:01.745 --> 36:02.871
What you saying?

36:02.871 --> 36:05.040
Well, their coaches would take on MYF,

36:05.040 --> 36:06.959
and Mr. Carlos would take on the visitors.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.461
It gives my guys an opportunity
to hear another voice.

36:09.962 --> 36:11.755
And also, it gives Swagger an opportunity

36:11.755 --> 36:13.215
to be coached by a living legend.

36:15.050 --> 36:15.884
Let's do it.

36:15.884 --> 36:17.719
- Right on, bro.
- All right. Let's go then.

36:17.719 --> 36:18.971
All right, Ikey. Let's go.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.890
- You ready?
- It's going down right now.

36:22.933 --> 36:24.226
Okay.

36:24.226 --> 36:25.310
Get back.

36:29.523 --> 36:30.774
- What up, bro?
- Good to see you, dog.

36:30.774 --> 36:31.900
- Yeah.
- Hey, Vince. What's up?

36:31.900 --> 36:32.818
Bros.

36:34.027 --> 36:36.697
- What's up, bruh? Good to see you, bruh.
- It's great to see you, bro.

36:36.697 --> 36:38.073
Good. What's up, man?

36:39.199 --> 36:41.368
- Hey. What's good, Vince?
- Coming for you, bro.

36:41.869 --> 36:42.870
We'll see.

37:05.225 --> 37:06.602
Hey, yo, Mus.

37:06.602 --> 37:08.061
I got you. Let's get it.

37:15.819 --> 37:16.862
Way too easy.

37:21.116 --> 37:24.077
Man, I've been waiting for this all week.

37:24.077 --> 37:25.162
Oh, yeah?

37:25.662 --> 37:26.788
Jace Carson.

37:26.788 --> 37:27.873
Deandre Wright.

37:28.916 --> 37:29.917
It's been, like, what,

37:30.709 --> 37:32.961
three years since we last played
on the ABO circuit together?

37:32.961 --> 37:35.881
Yeah, something like that.
You were the second best dude out there.

37:37.966 --> 37:38.800
Crazy.

37:40.552 --> 37:41.887
I'm coming for you today.

37:43.180 --> 37:44.515
I'm right here.

37:44.515 --> 37:45.599
Aight.

37:55.150 --> 37:56.777
- You ready?
- I was born for this.

37:56.777 --> 37:58.153
- Black going this way.
- Let's go!

37:58.153 --> 37:59.404
White go this way.

38:01.698 --> 38:02.699
Hope you ready.

38:03.325 --> 38:04.826
- Hope you ready.
- Hey, come on.

38:07.412 --> 38:08.413
Lock that up!

38:11.792 --> 38:12.876
I'm different, Jace.

38:12.876 --> 38:14.461
You know that.

38:14.461 --> 38:15.796
Let's go. We up.

38:19.424 --> 38:21.844
- Come here, little bro.
- Communicate, communicate!

38:21.844 --> 38:22.761
Excuse me.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.972
- Swing! Watch the swing.
- Cook him, Jace!

38:24.972 --> 38:26.056
Cook him.

38:27.850 --> 38:29.518
Jace, let's go. Let's move.

38:29.518 --> 38:32.104
Listen. You don't weigh enough.

38:33.188 --> 38:34.147
Ball.

38:35.107 --> 38:36.775
Talk to each other.

38:36.775 --> 38:39.278
- Yeah, Vince!
- Let's go!

38:41.363 --> 38:42.573
Let's go, baby.

39:00.716 --> 39:02.467
Come on, y'all.

39:02.467 --> 39:03.594
My bad.

39:04.344 --> 39:05.596
Yeah, boy.

39:13.896 --> 39:15.522
Take your shot right here.

39:46.428 --> 39:48.347
Hey, hey, hey. Talk to each other.

39:48.347 --> 39:50.265
You know, one good thing about
being in this place?

39:52.142 --> 39:53.810
- What?
- I get my old number back.

39:53.810 --> 39:54.895
You got to show me.

39:59.566 --> 40:01.235
Come on! Let's go!

40:25.467 --> 40:27.636
Hey, you about to collect on that bet.

41:00.669 --> 41:03.505
Let's go. Feed the big man.
Feed the big man down low!

41:03.505 --> 41:05.215
- Feed him.
- Come on, Pop.

41:07.176 --> 41:08.510
Let's go, guys!

41:13.974 --> 41:17.477
Let's go!

41:17.978 --> 41:20.689
Move!

41:26.778 --> 41:29.531
Gotta work that defense down below.
Better defense.

41:29.531 --> 41:31.325
Hey, yo! Slide up.

41:31.325 --> 41:33.160
- Hop to it.
- I'm right here.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.495
- Watch 21!
- Come on! Energy!

41:35.495 --> 41:36.914
Eyes on 21!

41:43.837 --> 41:46.215
Will the real "My bad" please stand up?

41:46.215 --> 41:48.550
Don't lose focus.

41:49.384 --> 41:50.802
Hey, lock up, y'all!

42:11.865 --> 42:14.159
Five seconds!

42:14.743 --> 42:15.953
Drew, wait.

42:17.621 --> 42:19.540
- Hey, look here. Look here.
- Lock down D.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.708
Go right here! Lock down D!

42:21.708 --> 42:23.585
- Get back, get back.
- Get it!

42:27.548 --> 42:28.841
- Let's go!
- We do this.

42:28.841 --> 42:30.509
Swagger win.

42:31.718 --> 42:32.886
We promised you a showdown.

42:32.886 --> 42:35.556
You did great, baby. You did great.
All right.

42:38.934 --> 42:39.935
Let's go.

42:40.727 --> 42:42.354
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:49.653 --> 42:50.821
Great job.

42:51.905 --> 42:53.574
Yes, sir, 21.

42:54.199 --> 42:56.034
What are we doing?

42:56.994 --> 42:58.787
We supposed to make a statement!

42:58.787 --> 43:00.455
This is bullshit!

43:00.455 --> 43:02.958
- Hey. Chill.
- This was our chance!

43:02.958 --> 43:04.418
- This was our chance.
- Damn.

43:04.418 --> 43:05.878
Relax. I got him.

43:05.878 --> 43:08.672
- Why y'all walking up on me, man? Back up.
- Bruh, chill. Yo, these my brothers, man.

43:08.672 --> 43:10.507
- These my brothers.
- Hey, tighten up, bruh. You good.

43:10.507 --> 43:13.260
Me and you just went toe-to-toe.
You that guy.

43:14.928 --> 43:16.138
- Good, bro.
- Aight.

43:18.932 --> 43:20.684
Y'all good. I got y'all. Come on.

43:20.684 --> 43:22.394
Stay in it.

43:23.061 --> 43:25.647
Well, guys, I want you to know
it's been a fantastic weekend.

43:25.647 --> 43:27.566
You guys played a hell of a game.

43:27.566 --> 43:31.612
And what I got out of it, no matter
was you incarcerated or not,

43:32.279 --> 43:33.280
we are one.

43:33.906 --> 43:35.616
We are free in our minds and our hearts.

43:35.616 --> 43:38.285
They asked me how come I don't
take a picture putting my fist up,

43:38.285 --> 43:40.370
and I tell them because I am the fist.

43:41.163 --> 43:42.998
I'm bestowing that upon you,

43:42.998 --> 43:45.417
each and every one of you players
here today.

43:45.417 --> 43:49.880
You are now the fist. Carry it strong.
Be proud of it.

43:49.880 --> 43:54.635
Remember, fist means unification.
Togetherness. Thank you.

44:00.891 --> 44:01.934
Let's raise 'em up.

45:10.085 --> 45:11.545
Right. This what we doing?

45:11.545 --> 45:13.422
- Go ahead, boy. Go ahead.
- Come on, Mus.

45:13.422 --> 45:15.632
All right, I got y'all. Listen.

45:16.383 --> 45:17.759
<i>Got bars just like the pen</i>

45:17.759 --> 45:20.012
<i>The spot where they're holding us down
The Black and the brown</i>

45:20.012 --> 45:22.306
<i>They profiting off our young men
Bodies in chains</i>

45:22.306 --> 45:23.640
<i>But brain, I let it run free</i>

45:23.640 --> 45:24.975
<i>Time's ticking
I'm watching Big Ben</i>

45:24.975 --> 45:27.436
<i>'Cause when I get out about
Ain't worry about clout</i>

45:27.436 --> 45:29.563
<i>Gon' make me a million and ten
Raising the bar</i>

45:29.563 --> 45:32.149
<i>We setting the trend
Said make me a million and ten</i>

45:32.149 --> 45:34.735
<i>In the meantime
Between time I do rhyme</i>

45:34.735 --> 45:35.819
<i>I'm with my brothers and them</i>

45:35.819 --> 45:38.155
<i>Allah got us, don dadas
Young ballers</i>

45:38.155 --> 45:39.531
<i>We practicing teachings of Zen</i>

45:39.531 --> 45:41.867
<i>Meditate, never hate
No debate</i>

45:41.867 --> 45:43.410
<i>Our swagger gon' ring out again</i>

45:43.410 --> 45:46.288
<i>Our swagger gon' ring out again
Our swagger gon' ring out again</i>

45:46.288 --> 45:48.540
- Our swagger gon' ring out again
- Hold on. Yo.

45:48.540 --> 45:50.167
Start a beat for me real quick.

45:51.335 --> 45:54.463
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

45:54.463 --> 45:56.798
<i>Today I read a note
It filled my heart with warm pleasure</i>

45:56.798 --> 45:58.759
<i>Seven pounds, six ounces
Measures my born treasure</i>

45:58.759 --> 46:01.470
<i>I thought I knew happiness
But I'm informed better</i>

46:01.470 --> 46:04.223
<i>God gifted me a son
Now I'm blessed forever</i>

46:04.223 --> 46:06.391
<i>I'm on the straight and narrow now, man
This is it</i>

46:06.391 --> 46:08.810
<i>MJ lifestyle, smooth criminal bullshit</i>

46:08.810 --> 46:10.771
<i>I'll shoot my shot
A new life with a full clip</i>

46:10.771 --> 46:13.190
<i>That's the target, me
This bull's-eye is on it</i>

46:19.363 --> 46:21.281
Tiffany, talk to me. What's the word?

46:21.281 --> 46:24.368
<i>Hey, I said I'd call you when
we're done. We're on a break right now.</i>

46:24.368 --> 46:27.162
Okay, but what is
the governing board saying?

46:27.162 --> 46:30.791
I mean, you guys do realize that
when Crystal Jarrett went on her IG Live,

46:30.791 --> 46:33.752
she got one million viewers, right?
One million.

46:33.752 --> 46:36.797
Not to mention the turnout that they had
at the Hilltop Central game.

46:36.797 --> 46:40.676
A whole network of Black students
from all across the DMV showed up.

46:40.676 --> 46:43.887
The DA's office has been flooded
with letters

46:43.887 --> 46:45.931
in support of Jace Carson
and his teammates.

46:45.931 --> 46:49.268
Now, you guys don't wanna be
on the wrong side of this, do you?

46:50.060 --> 46:53.272
<i>Dr. Emory Lawson
seems to think you and him are aligned.</i>

46:53.814 --> 46:56.400
Well, it's safer for him to think that.

46:58.318 --> 47:01.196
Look, Tiff, you know me, aight?

47:01.196 --> 47:03.657
You know I'm not trying to cross
any lines here, but--

47:03.657 --> 47:07.703
<i>Then don't. Like I said, when
we have a ruling, I will let you know.</i>

47:08.328 --> 47:09.329
Tiff--

47:16.712 --> 47:18.088
It's pretty good, man.

47:18.088 --> 47:20.174
Yeah, that's because you don't
got to eat it every day.

47:20.674 --> 47:23.927
Right. That's why we got this.

47:23.927 --> 47:26.555
- Is that Mumbo sauce?
- You know it.

47:26.555 --> 47:30.267
You mix a little bit of ketchup,
barbecue sauce, hot sauce and applesauce.

47:30.976 --> 47:33.228
- Then boom, Mumbo on deck.
- Nah.

47:33.854 --> 47:35.355
- Bruh, you lunching.
- Nah.

47:35.355 --> 47:37.357
- Ain't no way. Hold on.
- I'm trying to tell you.

47:37.357 --> 47:39.276
- That boy lunching.
- Crazy.

47:39.943 --> 47:41.278
Little bit of that.

47:41.278 --> 47:42.696
Can't forget the applesauce.

47:43.947 --> 47:45.199
Yo.

47:47.910 --> 47:49.244
Aight, let me see.

47:55.167 --> 47:56.960
- Yeah.
- Nah.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.463
Yo, yo, no cap.
This tastes just like the carryout.

47:59.463 --> 48:01.173
- Yo! Yeah!
- Let me see.

48:01.173 --> 48:03.050
Yo. Get some of this.

48:03.050 --> 48:04.343
Yo, he ain't lying!

48:09.431 --> 48:10.432
Vince Charles.

48:19.024 --> 48:20.150
You holding up?

48:21.235 --> 48:24.738
Yeah. Listen, I know I let you down, man.

48:24.738 --> 48:26.949
I mean, I know I let everybody down.

48:28.450 --> 48:30.369
I didn't even want you guys
to find me here, to be honest.

48:30.369 --> 48:34.414
Vince, I feel like I let you down.

48:34.414 --> 48:36.416
I was on some dumb shit, Coach.

48:36.959 --> 48:39.461
We were broke. Look, it was me and my f--

48:39.461 --> 48:44.883
Listen, you don't
have to explain none of that to me.

48:45.717 --> 48:48.804
- Okay?
- Aight.

48:52.266 --> 48:53.642
How much longer are you in here?

48:55.018 --> 48:56.311
Three more months.

48:56.311 --> 48:59.857
When I turn 18,
they transfer me to Patuxent.

49:00.899 --> 49:02.401
Then I gotta do another year there.

49:04.653 --> 49:07.739
I mean, well, look, don't freeze
your coach out,

49:07.739 --> 49:09.157
you know.

49:09.157 --> 49:11.618
I'ma write you,
and your ass better write me back.

49:12.202 --> 49:13.161
Yeah.

49:13.161 --> 49:14.454
Listen, Vince,

49:16.164 --> 49:17.165
I know you.

49:18.876 --> 49:21.962
And you are not your biggest mistake.

49:23.422 --> 49:28.969
Damn, Coach. That really means something.

49:28.969 --> 49:30.095
I'm glad.

49:36.518 --> 49:37.561
All right.

49:37.561 --> 49:40.147
- I got about six more months.
- Aight, bet.

49:40.147 --> 49:41.607
I mean, you already got it,

49:41.607 --> 49:45.485
but you can use this last bit of time
to just train, train, train.

49:45.485 --> 49:47.863
- By the time you out of here...
- Nah.

49:48.488 --> 49:50.157
My basketball days, man.

49:51.825 --> 49:54.494
Look, I don't do well with stress.

49:55.037 --> 49:57.789
Looks like you handled all the stress
out there today pretty well.

49:57.789 --> 50:00.167
Man, that? Man, that was light work.

50:00.876 --> 50:02.044
You shouldn't play with me.

50:02.711 --> 50:03.795
He called us light work.

50:04.796 --> 50:06.715
Y'all ever heard of South Plains College?

50:07.883 --> 50:11.345
That's a juco in Texas.
Got some good things going on over there.

50:11.845 --> 50:13.972
They wanna take a look at me
after I get out.

50:14.556 --> 50:16.058
That's what's up. And congrats on that.

50:16.058 --> 50:19.520
Thank you.
You think y'all can put in a word?

50:19.520 --> 50:23.524
With your hops and your nasty defense?
You got my word.

50:24.858 --> 50:29.988
Hey, team. Y'all gonna put
a dollar in my phone account?

50:30.614 --> 50:31.448
Here you go.

50:31.448 --> 50:32.741
Always begging for some shit.

50:32.741 --> 50:34.159
I'm for real.

50:34.159 --> 50:36.828
I bet a week's worth
of calls on this game.

50:37.329 --> 50:38.872
I can't not call my family for a week.

50:39.831 --> 50:41.333
And what does that have to do with us?

50:41.333 --> 50:44.378
Everything. What you mean?
I got into this by losing.

50:44.378 --> 50:46.588
Hey, man,
I'll put three dollars on there, bro.

50:47.214 --> 50:48.632
Thanks, D.

50:49.299 --> 50:51.969
Hey, Vince, what about you?

50:53.971 --> 50:57.599
I gotta check my account,
make sure my mom's wire came through.

50:57.599 --> 50:58.684
Sergeant Hampton?

50:59.726 --> 51:03.355
Hypothetically, if a visitor wanted
to put some money on someone's account

51:03.355 --> 51:06.149
so they could use the phone,
is that possible?

51:06.900 --> 51:09.194
Hypothetically, yes.

51:09.194 --> 51:12.155
On the way out,
visitors can stop by account services.

51:14.074 --> 51:15.450
It's a bug in my food.

51:16.201 --> 51:19.037
Who put that shit in there, huh?
Who did it?

51:19.037 --> 51:20.205
- Yo, D, chill.
- Relax, man.

51:20.205 --> 51:22.833
- We can get you another tray.
- Man, I'm not even hungry anymore.

51:22.833 --> 51:25.294
You know,
that's probably what they wanted too.

51:25.294 --> 51:27.796
- Have me starve after the game.
- Hey.

51:28.839 --> 51:31.466
Man, that's some straight up bullshit.

51:31.466 --> 51:33.177
- Hey!
- Yo, relax.

51:33.177 --> 51:34.094
- Come on.
- What?

51:34.094 --> 51:36.305
- Deandre, sit down.
- They always messing with me in here!

51:37.055 --> 51:40.058
- Why is that?
- Deandre, calm down.

51:40.058 --> 51:42.978
What-- Man, let me go. Let-- Get off me.

51:42.978 --> 51:45.397
- No. What are you doing?
- Yo! What are you doing?

51:45.397 --> 51:48.025
- That's not necessary. Let him go.
- Back up. This is for his own protection.

51:48.025 --> 51:50.277
- This some bullshit.
- Jace, that's enough!

51:52.112 --> 51:52.988
Man.

51:56.241 --> 51:57.659
Don't let them do this to you.

51:59.286 --> 52:01.663
Don't let them take your heart from you,
Jace Carson.

52:03.123 --> 52:06.793
If they think they can... they will!

52:09.338 --> 52:11.965
They've been putting me
on medication since I was 12.

52:13.759 --> 52:15.135
But I keep fighting.

52:16.303 --> 52:18.263
I keep fighting!

52:26.188 --> 52:27.189
Jace.

52:47.626 --> 52:49.920
This is not the way
I hoped the day would end.

52:51.088 --> 52:54.174
I wanna thank you guys.
Appreciate what you did.

52:55.342 --> 52:57.719
More than you'll ever know. Thank you.

53:36.466 --> 53:38.427
In this room right here
to your right, son.

53:57.196 --> 53:58.197
Pop.

54:01.783 --> 54:02.784
Hey.

54:06.997 --> 54:07.998
I...

54:10.834 --> 54:14.129
I haven't been
wearing my kufi like I used to do.

54:14.129 --> 54:19.051
I noticed. But you don't
gotta rock a kufi to be a good Muslim.

54:22.095 --> 54:23.180
I know. It's just...

54:25.807 --> 54:27.935
after everything that happened...

54:30.646 --> 54:32.189
I didn't know what I believed.

54:33.482 --> 54:34.483
I get it.

54:39.112 --> 54:44.409
You know, you told me
that I was here for a reason.

54:45.160 --> 54:46.161
Yes.

54:46.912 --> 54:49.081
You told me I can make a difference.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.294
And if I lose faith in that?

54:54.920 --> 54:56.338
We lose everything.

54:59.216 --> 55:00.968
I really wanna make dua right now.

55:04.137 --> 55:05.138
Me too, Son.

55:10.269 --> 55:11.645
<i>Bismillah.</i>

55:13.272 --> 55:14.273
<i>Bismillah.</i>

55:20.696 --> 55:23.532
We praise you, Allah.
We beseech you, Allah.

56:00.527 --> 56:01.528
You okay?

56:05.782 --> 56:06.783
I just felt rain.

56:15.709 --> 56:16.710
Let's hit the road.

56:29.556 --> 56:30.557
Hello.

56:34.728 --> 56:35.729
You sure?

56:37.564 --> 56:38.857
Hold on.

56:43.570 --> 56:46.365
Okay, can you text that to me?

56:47.866 --> 56:49.201
All right.

56:52.955 --> 56:54.915
I just got off the phone
with Alonzo Powers.

56:54.915 --> 56:59.127
He connected with some of your parents,
and the DA decided not to charge you.

57:01.338 --> 57:04.216
They're gonna want community service

57:04.216 --> 57:06.009
but there's no jail time.

57:07.302 --> 57:11.723
And "the Maryland Unified Athletic Council

57:11.723 --> 57:14.059
has suspended you
from all basketball endeavors."

57:15.894 --> 57:19.690
"However,
if you apologize for your actions...

57:21.942 --> 57:23.527
you'll be immediately reinstated."

57:28.532 --> 57:29.533
You're free.

57:41.628 --> 57:42.629
Let's go home.

58:04.943 --> 58:07.863
Let's go!

58:10.824 --> 58:13.493
Yeah, it's raining! Wash it all away!

58:13.493 --> 58:18.373
Wash it all away! It's raining! Let's go!

58:18.373 --> 58:20.459
- Okay, Nico. Let's go.
- Let's go!

58:22.544 --> 58:26.548
Let's go! Yeah!
