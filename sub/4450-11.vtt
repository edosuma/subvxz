to watch him work.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.153

04:46.186 --> 04:47.487

There was no divine

20:47.767 --> 20:51.037
- Agent DeMarco,
you going somewhere?

20:51.071 --> 20:52.772
- There she is.
Perfect timing.

20:52.806 --> 20:54.040
My good friend.

20:54.074 --> 20:56.643
You really are a glutton
for punishment, aren't you?

21:03.550 --> 21:03.981
[horses neighing]

21:05.418 --> 21:07.821
[bell rings]

21:07.821 --> 21:10.790
[man speaking indistinctly
over PA]

21:16.396 --> 21:17.797
- Beautiful creatures,
aren't they?

21:17.797 --> 21:19.799
- We talking
about the horses?

21:21.668 --> 21:24.537
- When Germaine hired a gangster
to manage his business,

21:24.537 --> 21:25.538
I was skeptical.

21:25.538 --> 21:28.541
I feared you'd be base,
ignorant.

21:28.541 --> 21:32.545
It seems my fears
are not without merit.

21:32.579 --> 21:34.814
- Well, you want to talk about
the Appaloosa spotting patterns

21:34.848 --> 21:36.983
on the Red Aurora?
'Cause we could talk about that.

21:36.983 --> 21:38.685
Or the fact
that Kramer in the First

21:38.718 --> 21:39.719
has an ambler's gait?

21:39.719 --> 21:41.087
We could definitely talk
about that,

21:41.321 --> 21:43.423
but please don't confuse
my passion for females

21:43.423 --> 21:45.825
as baseness.

21:45.825 --> 21:48.695
And, Paulo...

21:48.695 --> 21:50.530
don't ever confuse me
for a gangster.

21:50.563 --> 21:51.698
- Germaine expressed to me--

21:51.731 --> 21:52.966
- Germaine doesn't know
one thing about me.

21:52.966 --> 21:54.434
I spent a lot
of time and energy

21:54.434 --> 21:55.702
trying to get here
next to you...

21:55.735 --> 21:56.903
- Where's Germaine?

21:56.936 --> 21:58.304
- Because I think
there's something

21:58.304 --> 21:59.639
you and I need to talk about.

21:59.672 --> 22:02.041
- What is it that
you and I need to talk about?

22:05.612 --> 22:07.046
- My bank.

22:08.848 --> 22:10.416
- What part
of "ATF jurisdiction"

22:10.450 --> 22:11.818
was beyond
your comprehension?

22:11.851 --> 22:13.553
- I don't know. Why don't you
draw me another diagram?

22:13.586 --> 22:15.455
- You know, if you do want
to rough her up a bit,

22:15.455 --> 22:17.423
she can take it.
- Shut up, Marsden.

22:17.457 --> 22:19.859
You want me to detain you for
interfering with my operation?

22:19.893 --> 22:21.861
- This piece of shit
tied me to a chair

22:21.895 --> 22:23.463
and beat me near to death,
pregnant,

22:23.463 --> 22:25.965
and all you care about
is numbers.

22:25.999 --> 22:27.734
- DeMarco, I'm gonna tell you
one more time.

22:27.734 --> 22:29.736
Whatever you're feeling
is unimportant.

22:29.736 --> 22:31.738
My operation
will not take a backseat

22:31.738 --> 22:32.872
to your personal vendetta.

22:32.906 --> 22:34.607
- It's not a matter--

22:34.607 --> 22:37.477
- Period! Period!

22:37.510 --> 22:38.978
- You know...

22:39.012 --> 22:42.582
I know you Yanks aren't ones
for manners, but...

22:42.615 --> 22:43.983
where I'm from,
it's considered uncouth

22:44.017 --> 22:45.351
for a host to be gone
this long.

22:45.385 --> 22:47.420
- Come on, let's go.
I better not see you again.

22:51.691 --> 22:54.327
- Always a thrill,
Charlie.

23:01.734 --> 23:03.770
- Each cash house
has 35 workers.

23:03.803 --> 23:05.371
That's 35 mouths to feed

23:05.405 --> 23:07.574
and twice as many hands
touching your cash,

23:07.607 --> 23:10.510
and we're stashing millions
in these South Florida homes.

23:10.510 --> 23:12.045
I mean,
it's just ill-conceived.

23:12.078 --> 23:13.646
- We've had no mishaps
in the past.

23:13.646 --> 23:14.747
- That's not the point.

23:14.781 --> 23:16.015
The point is you want
a numbered account.

23:16.049 --> 23:17.784
The bank cuts out
the middleman.

23:17.784 --> 23:21.454
This is 100% legitimate,
federally insured.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.356
The money passes
through a concentration account,

23:23.356 --> 23:24.891
so it never registers
as a deposit.

23:24.924 --> 23:27.026
And if you like, you know,
we can keep it local,

23:27.060 --> 23:29.862
or we can ship it overseas.

23:29.896 --> 23:32.899
- And for this service
your cut is?

23:32.899 --> 23:34.601
- I don't have a cut.

23:34.634 --> 23:36.069
I operate
like every other bank--

23:36.302 --> 23:38.071
Chase, Bank of America.

23:38.071 --> 23:40.940
I simply invest your capital
until you come to collect.

23:40.940 --> 23:45.044
- Germaine brings you in,
and this is his requital?

23:45.078 --> 23:46.779
You're not one
for loyalty, I see.

23:46.813 --> 23:48.815
- No disrespect,
but if you cared about loyalty,

23:48.815 --> 23:50.950
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

23:50.950 --> 23:53.419
I'm putting 30%
back in your pocket.

23:54.454 --> 23:55.989
- It's a reassuring name--

23:56.022 --> 23:57.323
DLJ Trust.

23:57.357 --> 23:58.791
- Well, if you're looking
for reassurance,

23:58.791 --> 24:00.893
find it
in the business model.

24:00.927 --> 24:03.396
I can show you around tomorrow
if you want.

24:03.396 --> 24:05.064
- You slithering snake.

24:05.064 --> 24:07.634
I leave for ten minutes,
and you nick my seat?

24:07.667 --> 24:09.602
- Just keeping the throne
warm for you, boss.

24:09.636 --> 24:12.872
- You're a proxy.
Don't get comfortable.

24:15.308 --> 24:16.776
Enjoying the race?

24:16.809 --> 24:18.578
Everything
to your satisfaction?

24:18.611 --> 24:20.446
- Yes.

24:20.446 --> 24:22.048
I'd say
I'm quite satisfied.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.657
- So for Tev's funeral,
what do you think, guy--

24:30.690 --> 24:32.058
three guards is enough?

24:32.292 --> 24:34.560
- Jesus Christ, Ari.
Three guards?

24:34.594 --> 24:36.696
What are three guards
gonna do if Soto comes hard?

24:36.696 --> 24:38.965
- "Comes hard"?

24:38.965 --> 24:41.367
You don't know
the meaning of hard.

24:41.401 --> 24:43.303
[gun cocks]

24:43.303 --> 24:46.306
- Okay, why don't we go with
an even dozen just to be safe?

24:46.339 --> 24:47.907
- [chuckles]

24:47.940 --> 24:48.908
[gun cocks]

24:48.941 --> 24:50.576
[cell phone vibrating]

24:50.576 --> 24:53.313
- [sighs] Sorry, man.
I got to take this.

24:53.313 --> 24:54.314
[gun cocks]

24:54.314 --> 24:57.050
[cell phone beeps]

24:57.083 --> 24:58.418
Yeah, what's up?

24:58.451 --> 24:59.686
- Hey, man,
so you know that girl

24:59.719 --> 25:01.688
you decided to sleep with?
- Yeah.

25:01.721 --> 25:03.923
- Javi's on his way
to kill her right now.

25:03.956 --> 25:05.291
- What?

25:05.325 --> 25:06.859
- This whole damn family's
crazy, man.

25:06.893 --> 25:09.662
Mama's made peace with Martun,
but now she's saying

25:09.696 --> 25:11.464
she wants Javi to go cut
her head off or something.

25:11.464 --> 25:13.800
I don't know.

25:13.833 --> 25:15.735
- [sighs]
Okay, thanks for the heads-up.

25:15.735 --> 25:17.337
I'll handle it.
- You need backup?

25:17.337 --> 25:19.472
- No, no, nobody's gonna die
on my watch, bro.

25:19.472 --> 25:20.540
I owe you.

25:20.573 --> 25:21.908
- Okay, man,
let me know.

25:23.776 --> 25:24.744
- So?

25:24.777 --> 25:26.312
- Okay,
how about a compromise?

25:26.346 --> 25:27.880
We do ten guys.
- Ten's good.

25:27.914 --> 25:30.416
- Couple of you guys
in car out front.

25:30.450 --> 25:32.352
The rest of you guys inside.

25:32.352 --> 25:35.655
Now go home,
get some nice sleep.

25:40.893 --> 25:43.896
- Hey, Ari, listen,
uh, that phone call back there--

25:43.896 --> 25:47.033
that, uh--
that was Eva, Javi's girl.

25:47.066 --> 25:48.901
- Jesus Christ.
Are you a carpenter?

25:48.901 --> 25:50.903
- What do you mean?
- You're still nailing that?

25:50.903 --> 25:52.839
- No, I'm not still
nailing that.

25:52.872 --> 25:54.440
Ari, listen to me.

25:54.474 --> 25:56.909
She says that Javi's
on his way to her house,

25:56.943 --> 25:58.311
that he means
to kill her.

25:58.344 --> 26:00.513
Now, I think maybe
we should roll by

26:00.513 --> 26:01.914
and say a little hello
to him,

26:01.914 --> 26:03.916
hit him when he's separated
from his Soto enforcers.

26:03.950 --> 26:05.485
- No, no, no, no.
You heard Martun.

26:05.518 --> 26:07.653
Nobody make a move.
We're in a holding pattern.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.021
- A holding pattern, huh?

26:09.055 --> 26:10.490
Okay, Ari,
So what's your plan, then?

26:10.490 --> 26:13.393
We just, uh, wait here
for them to hit us?

26:14.794 --> 26:17.897
- You know, I don't care if you
would have banged his mother.

26:17.897 --> 26:19.766
If I was Tevan,

26:19.766 --> 26:21.934
that guy never would have come
into my place

26:21.934 --> 26:23.536
and pulled a gun on me.

26:23.536 --> 26:25.805
If Martun would have seen
that disrespect,

26:25.805 --> 26:27.940
he would have buried
them right there.

26:27.940 --> 26:29.675
- That's my point.

26:29.709 --> 26:31.677
They don't respect you, Ari.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.946
Now, did they put an eagle
and a lion on your arms

26:33.946 --> 26:35.481
for fashion
or for function?

26:35.515 --> 26:38.418
It's time for you to show them
who you are.

26:40.553 --> 26:42.522
- [inhales deeply]

26:42.522 --> 26:44.390
Let's go save
your girlfriend.

26:44.390 --> 26:45.792
- That's what
I'm talking about.

26:48.394 --> 26:51.431
[tires squealing]

27:01.407 --> 27:02.809
- You didn't have
to do shit, Eva.

27:02.809 --> 27:04.710
All you had to do
was not screw up,

27:04.710 --> 27:06.579
but you couldn't even
do that, huh?

27:06.612 --> 27:08.514
- Javi, please.

27:08.548 --> 27:09.816
I was stupid.

27:09.849 --> 27:12.452
- Damn straight
you were stupid.

27:12.452 --> 27:15.388
You got that pretty-ass face,
huh, Eva?

27:15.421 --> 27:17.523
And that's what gets your ass
in trouble.

27:17.557 --> 27:19.792
- [whimpering]
I'm sorry, Javi!

27:19.826 --> 27:21.561
Please!

27:21.561 --> 27:23.296
- This is what happens
to putas.

27:23.296 --> 27:25.765
- [screaming]

27:29.302 --> 27:30.837
- Uh-huh.
That felt good.

27:30.837 --> 27:32.839
That felt really good.

27:32.839 --> 27:34.841
- [screaming]

27:34.874 --> 27:37.710
- Okay, stop screaming.
I just saved you, dumb-dumb.

27:37.710 --> 27:40.580
Hey, stop screaming.
You sound like a car alarm.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.381
- Ari, I'll--
I'll handle her.

27:42.415 --> 27:43.449
Eva, Eva.
- No.

27:43.449 --> 27:45.718
- Hey, look at me.
Let's go, okay?

27:45.751 --> 27:46.953
Come with me.

27:46.986 --> 27:49.989
- Yeah, buddy.
- Get your shoes on.

27:50.022 --> 27:52.859
- Buddy, you're leaking.

27:52.892 --> 27:54.994
You're soaking wet.

27:54.994 --> 27:56.662
You got something
right here.

27:56.696 --> 27:59.665
- Let's go. Come on.

28:02.034 --> 28:04.871
Hey, look at me.

28:04.871 --> 28:07.340
You've got to get
out of town, okay?

28:07.373 --> 28:09.008
Your boyfriend, Javi,
he is dead.

28:09.041 --> 28:11.010
But his people
will come after you.

28:11.043 --> 28:12.578
You can never come
back here.

28:12.612 --> 28:14.013
You can never call anyone
that you know,

28:14.046 --> 28:15.882
and you can never talk
about what you saw.

28:15.915 --> 28:17.950
Take this.

28:17.984 --> 28:19.952
- This is your fault,
shithead.

28:19.986 --> 28:23.322
You no-dick asshole.
I wish I'd never met you.

28:23.356 --> 28:25.958
What is this--$1,000?

28:25.992 --> 28:27.960
- Eva, I'm sorry.

28:27.994 --> 28:29.629
- Yeah.

28:29.662 --> 28:31.697
I'm sure you are.

28:46.679 --> 28:47.747
- Got a mess here, huh?

28:47.780 --> 28:49.715
- This is nothing.

28:58.391 --> 29:00.726
- Ari, what are you doing?

29:00.760 --> 29:03.896
- Gonna send them a message
they gonna understand.

29:15.808 --> 29:16.776
I told you, Gusti is lying.
Briggs is involved.

29:18.544 --> 29:21.514
- No, it's not possible.
LA to Seattle is three hours.

29:21.547 --> 29:23.416
- 2 hours, 40.
- It's barely a difference.

29:23.416 --> 29:24.951
- Well, we live and die
by "barelys," okay?

29:24.951 --> 29:27.653
In that 20 minutes, Briggs could
have rented a car, hailed a cab.

29:27.687 --> 29:29.789
He could have hired a goddamn
airlift to the Puget Sound.

29:29.822 --> 29:31.791
- No. There's no way Briggs
could have gotten to the ship

29:31.791 --> 29:33.659
and back in time
for his return flight.

29:33.693 --> 29:35.494
- It's got
to be San Francisco, okay?

29:35.528 --> 29:38.364
- Yo, Briggs wasn't
in Frisco, man.

29:38.397 --> 29:39.665
He was in Mexico that day,

29:39.665 --> 29:41.334
having his first meeting
with Caza.

29:41.367 --> 29:42.735
I asked him to help me out
with Carlito, man.

29:42.768 --> 29:43.803
Before he met up with you,

29:43.836 --> 29:48.608
he was in TJ eating goat
with Alfredo Armas.

29:50.443 --> 29:51.444
- [sighs]

29:51.477 --> 29:54.413
- Okay, well,
if Briggs was in Mexico,

29:54.447 --> 29:56.916
then none of our routes
work out anymore.

30:11.998 --> 30:14.300
- Wait.

30:17.336 --> 30:18.838
The ship refuels
for the last leg

30:18.871 --> 30:20.439
of its journey
in Santa Barbara.

30:20.473 --> 30:23.442
Briggs could have left
Tijuana,

30:23.442 --> 30:25.578
driven past LA
to Santa Barbara,

30:25.578 --> 30:26.712
and still got back

30:26.746 --> 30:29.582
in time to meet me at the docks
and see Gusti.

30:29.582 --> 30:31.450
- Yeah, that's over ten hours
of driving.

30:31.484 --> 30:32.585
- It's a stretch,
but it's possible.

30:32.618 --> 30:33.853
- Barely.
- Exactly.

30:33.886 --> 30:36.989
And Briggs
was late that day.

30:38.591 --> 30:39.992
We got to go.
- Go where?

30:40.026 --> 30:41.594
- Santa Barbara.

30:41.627 --> 30:43.396
All right, a fueling station
means Coast Guard.

30:43.429 --> 30:44.864
Coast Guard means cameras.

30:44.897 --> 30:46.732
This whole thing
could be on tape.

30:46.732 --> 30:49.001
- What if we get there
and there's nothing?

30:49.001 --> 30:51.704
- [sighs]

30:51.737 --> 30:53.472
Then I'll drop it, okay?

30:53.506 --> 30:55.074
I'll shut up about all this.

30:55.307 --> 30:57.476
- Mike, I don't know
about your sarin, man,

30:57.476 --> 31:00.446
but I do know Briggs
didn't come home last night,

31:00.479 --> 31:03.349
and now Soto Street's calling
everybody in and--

31:03.349 --> 31:05.818
[sighs]

31:05.851 --> 31:07.853
Look, I don't know.
Maybe you could be right, man.

31:07.887 --> 31:08.988
Maybe something's up.

31:12.458 --> 31:14.026
- They know how to keep
their eyes closed

31:14.026 --> 31:15.494
and their mouths shut.

31:15.494 --> 31:16.896
- So your employees
won't be handling the money.

31:16.896 --> 31:18.330
- No.

31:18.364 --> 31:19.699
I mean, they could.
They'd probably do a fine job.

31:19.732 --> 31:23.369
But only I handle the cash
and manage the accounts.

31:23.369 --> 31:24.904
- How long until the funds
are accessible?

31:24.937 --> 31:27.506
- Like any other bank--
24 hours.

31:27.540 --> 31:28.908
I mean, you're handing me
millions, right?

31:28.941 --> 31:30.609
It's not gonna count itself.

31:30.643 --> 31:33.646
Listen,
it's my understanding--

31:33.646 --> 31:35.514
- This numbskull's gonna
make it easy for us.

31:35.514 --> 31:37.349
I mean, he literally
brings the money to us.

31:37.383 --> 31:40.019
We count it, catalog it, send it
to the Federal freakin' Reserve.

31:40.052 --> 31:41.854
In the meantime,
we see where he wires funds,

31:41.887 --> 31:45.424
who he's writing checks to, even
what pornos he's jerking off to,

31:45.458 --> 31:47.359
all without Germaine.

31:47.359 --> 31:48.728
- I'm not letting
you have him.

31:48.761 --> 31:50.429
- You want
to be punitive, fine.

31:50.463 --> 31:53.599
You're not gonna get Paulo,
'cause now he belongs to Jakes,

31:53.632 --> 31:54.767
not Germaine.

31:54.767 --> 31:55.935
- You're backing me
into a corner.

31:55.935 --> 31:58.003
- Oh, come off it.
You backed me in a corner.

31:58.037 --> 31:59.472
I'm just backing us out.

32:01.507 --> 32:03.676
- It's my understanding that you
have a lot of influence

32:03.676 --> 32:05.544
over Germaine's
other clients.

32:05.544 --> 32:07.413
You think this is something
they might be interested in?

32:07.446 --> 32:11.617
- I think if what you're telling
me bears out,

32:11.650 --> 32:13.419
they would be fools not to.

32:23.796 --> 32:26.632
- So your network
stays intact.

32:26.665 --> 32:28.801
- And you're prepared
to hand this over to ATF?

32:28.801 --> 32:30.669
- It's all yours,

32:30.669 --> 32:32.404
as long as you keep
your end of the deal.

32:32.438 --> 32:35.374
- And what end is that?

32:36.642 --> 32:38.077
- You know what we got here,
Charlie?

32:38.310 --> 32:40.312
We got ourselves
a proper little farce.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.049
You grab me,
they make you let me go.

32:44.083 --> 32:47.453
You grab me,
they make you let me go.

32:47.453 --> 32:49.288
It's all running
through doors

32:49.288 --> 32:50.689
and never quite meeting
in the hallway.

32:50.689 --> 32:51.957
- This is the hallway,
Germaine.

32:51.957 --> 32:53.626
There are no more doors
to run through.

32:53.659 --> 32:56.495
- Ah, see, I don't think
you quite fathom the nature

32:56.529 --> 32:58.330
of my arrangement.

32:59.698 --> 33:01.033
You can't touch me.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.068
- Dale Jenkins, your friend--

33:03.302 --> 33:05.938
his real name is Dale Jakes,
and he's a federal agent.

33:05.971 --> 33:08.707
And just this morning
he stole your top client--

33:08.707 --> 33:11.310
Paulo Cavalcanti.

33:11.343 --> 33:14.413
- That's bollocks.
- I don't know what that means.

33:14.446 --> 33:17.716
- That means
you're full of shit.

33:17.716 --> 33:19.084
- Am I?

33:24.323 --> 33:27.293
[laughing]

33:28.894 --> 33:30.696
- You little bitch.

33:30.729 --> 33:33.032
I should have dropped you from
a ledge when I had the chance.

33:36.001 --> 33:38.971
I'll give it to you, though.

33:39.004 --> 33:40.873
You can take the punishment,
can't you?

33:40.873 --> 33:42.575
You should be proud of that.

33:42.608 --> 33:43.976
I don't know.
Maybe you even like it.

33:44.009 --> 33:44.977
But I did notice...

33:46.745 --> 33:48.881
You don't have
a big old belly.

33:48.914 --> 33:51.951
Things didn't work out
in the baby department, huh?

33:53.752 --> 33:56.355
Oh, was that my fault?

33:57.857 --> 34:00.626
Good.

34:00.626 --> 34:02.027
Come on, Charlie.

34:02.061 --> 34:03.762
Come on.

34:03.796 --> 34:05.965
Give me one...

34:05.998 --> 34:08.467
for your little dead baby.

34:11.036 --> 34:12.905
- You think I'm stupid?

34:12.905 --> 34:14.974
You're angling
for a brutality charge.

34:15.007 --> 34:17.343
That shit ain't
happening today, scumbag.

34:19.545 --> 34:22.915
I'll see you at trial.

34:22.915 --> 34:26.518
[door opens]

34:36.528 --> 34:38.364
- Hey.
How you doing?

34:38.364 --> 34:41.400
- [breathing heavily]

34:43.402 --> 34:47.072
I beat the shit out of him
a thousand times in my head.

34:47.072 --> 34:50.009
- We're gonna talk
about it, okay?

34:54.380 --> 34:55.814
- Damn it.

34:55.848 --> 34:57.383
[groans]

34:58.550 --> 34:59.785
- Hey, José.
- Hola.

34:59.818 --> 35:02.421
- Javi didn't come home
last night.

35:02.454 --> 35:03.923
- You think he's still
dealing with that girl?

35:03.923 --> 35:05.057
- We sent people there.

35:05.057 --> 35:07.593
No one was there--
just blood.

35:09.929 --> 35:13.399
- Look, I used
to stay out late too, you know?

35:13.399 --> 35:14.667
Just out being stupid.

35:14.667 --> 35:16.535
My moms would worry,
but I was always okay.

35:16.535 --> 35:18.771
- It's a mother's job
to worry.

35:18.804 --> 35:20.940
- Honestly, señora,
I don't think anything

35:20.940 --> 35:22.808
could keep him
away from your carnitas.

35:22.808 --> 35:24.810
He'll be fine, all right?
- Okay.

35:24.843 --> 35:26.512
- Señora?

35:26.545 --> 35:27.646
You got a package.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.316
- Package from who?

35:36.388 --> 35:38.557
- Aah!

35:38.557 --> 35:42.928
- [crying]
Javi!

35:42.962 --> 35:46.699
No, Javi, no!

35:46.699 --> 35:48.968
¿Cómo puede ser?

35:59.445 --> 36:00.079
- So I have been thinking
about you a lot,

36:02.982 --> 36:04.583
which is weird,

36:04.583 --> 36:06.618
because we don't even
know each other,

36:06.618 --> 36:08.487
so I have to fill in
the blanks,

36:08.487 --> 36:09.788
like a game of "Mad Libs."

36:09.822 --> 36:11.323
- And what did
you come up with?

36:11.323 --> 36:15.861
- Well, my first story
was mostly dirty words.

36:15.861 --> 36:18.697
- [laughs] Yeah.
Sounds about right.

36:18.731 --> 36:20.399
- But then I figured

36:20.432 --> 36:23.402
professional athlete/
volunteer firefighter.

36:23.435 --> 36:25.070
- You nailed it.
And I cook.

36:25.304 --> 36:28.307
- Ask for directions?
- Where are we?

36:28.340 --> 36:30.476
- So are you gonna tell me?

36:30.476 --> 36:31.610
- About me?

36:31.610 --> 36:32.745
Uh, yeah, yeah.

36:32.745 --> 36:35.681
I...I bank.
I'm a banker.

36:37.616 --> 36:40.452
Guess that makes us
both villains, huh?

36:40.486 --> 36:42.354
- You don't really think
I'm a villain, do you?

36:42.388 --> 36:44.456
- Nah, nah. I met a lot
of villains in my time.

36:44.490 --> 36:46.725
Trust me.
You don't really fit the bill.

36:46.759 --> 36:48.827
- You know,
there's a line we give

36:48.861 --> 36:53.298
to someone we first meet,
because inevitably they ask,

36:53.332 --> 36:54.900
"What's it like
to represent monsters?

36:54.933 --> 36:56.368
How do you sleep at night?"

36:56.402 --> 36:58.504
- And what do you say?

36:58.504 --> 37:02.875
- Every American, good or evil,
guilty or not guilty,

37:02.908 --> 37:04.043
deserves their chance

37:04.043 --> 37:05.844
at a fair trial
and legal counsel.

37:05.878 --> 37:07.479
Anything short of that--

37:07.513 --> 37:08.914
you may as well
tear up the Constitution.

37:08.947 --> 37:11.383
- But we both know
that's bullshit.

37:11.417 --> 37:12.518
- Yes.

37:12.518 --> 37:15.654
- So how do you?
How do you sleep at night?

37:15.654 --> 37:17.489
In a bed full of money?

37:17.489 --> 37:19.591
- Not quite, no.

37:19.625 --> 37:21.894
I mean, the pay is great.
Don't get me wrong.

37:21.894 --> 37:25.964
And the perks--who can say no
to a free day at the races?

37:25.998 --> 37:28.000
- Or free prawns.

37:28.033 --> 37:29.935
- The truth is...
- Mm.

37:29.935 --> 37:32.805
I am good at what I do,
the best.

37:32.805 --> 37:35.674
Not many people
can say that.

37:35.707 --> 37:37.543
- Let me ask you a question,
and if you don't want to answer,

37:37.543 --> 37:39.945
you don't have to.
- Go for it.

37:39.945 --> 37:43.582
- What were the dirty words
in your first story?

37:46.852 --> 37:50.556
- I never loved somebody the way
I loved him.

37:53.025 --> 37:55.928
When we were young...

37:55.928 --> 37:59.498
the older boys
used to pick on Tevan...

37:59.531 --> 38:02.634
because he was nothing
but skin and bones.

38:02.668 --> 38:04.670
Yeah, they were cruel
to you.

38:04.703 --> 38:08.774
The first time
I thought I would die

38:08.807 --> 38:13.545
was when I was protecting Tevan
from some boys twice my size...

38:13.579 --> 38:15.681
[scoffs]

38:15.714 --> 38:17.983
But I punched, right?

38:17.983 --> 38:19.952
And I kicked, and I bit...

38:19.985 --> 38:21.453
[laughs]

38:21.453 --> 38:25.057
[cries softly]

38:25.290 --> 38:28.727
And now
I can't protect him anymore.

38:30.295 --> 38:32.698
- We should make sure
we're set up.

38:32.731 --> 38:35.968
- Man, you're
one paranoid lady.

38:35.968 --> 38:39.671
Boss...

38:39.705 --> 38:42.441
a lot of people whispering
about those Mexicans.

38:42.441 --> 38:45.544
- Even on the worst
of battlefields,

38:45.577 --> 38:48.714
the enemy has the right
to say good-bye to their fallen.

38:48.714 --> 38:50.649
That's always been
the code.

38:50.682 --> 38:54.987
- Not everybody
respects that code, boss.

38:55.020 --> 38:57.589
- You...

38:57.623 --> 38:59.558
get your men in place.

38:59.591 --> 39:03.595
If anything is off, I want
to hear about it right away.

39:03.629 --> 39:05.631
- Okay.

39:09.768 --> 39:11.470
[distant ship horn blows]

39:11.503 --> 39:13.338
- Okay, I know exactly
what we're looking for,

39:13.372 --> 39:14.339
and I know when it was.

39:14.373 --> 39:15.807
I just need you
to pull the footage.

39:15.841 --> 39:17.409
- Aye, aye, Captain.

39:17.442 --> 39:20.412
The lot and pier feed
from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.881
- There.

39:22.881 --> 39:25.884
Edge of the frame.

39:25.918 --> 39:28.820
- Now what are we looking at?
- Bronco. That's his bumper.

39:28.854 --> 39:30.589
- Can you punch in?
- "Punch in"?

39:30.622 --> 39:31.657
This ain't NASA.

39:34.493 --> 39:37.596
- Mike, you might want
to take a look at this.

39:43.368 --> 39:45.904
- [sighs]
Son of a bitch.

39:45.904 --> 39:47.506
- Yeah.

39:47.539 --> 39:50.642
And there's our magician.
- Mm-hmm.

39:50.642 --> 39:51.777
- I just don't understand

39:51.777 --> 39:53.612
what Briggs
would be doing with sarin gas.

39:53.645 --> 39:57.516
[cell phone vibrating]

39:57.516 --> 39:58.650
- What, Johnny?

39:58.650 --> 40:00.352
- Shit's going down.

40:00.385 --> 40:01.653
- What are you
talking about?

40:01.653 --> 40:03.622
- Javi's head
just showed up in a box.

40:03.622 --> 40:04.856
Man, Teresa's losing her shit,

40:04.890 --> 40:07.025
talking about she wants
to wipe out the Sarkissians.

40:07.025 --> 40:08.627
- Oh, my God.

40:09.895 --> 40:11.630
- Look, she's sending us
over to the funeral.

40:11.663 --> 40:13.765
What do you want me to do?

40:13.799 --> 40:14.766
Mike?

40:14.800 --> 40:16.668
- Johnny, do they have
the sarin?

40:16.702 --> 40:17.903
- What?

40:17.936 --> 40:19.671
- Briggs set this up--
everything.

40:19.671 --> 40:20.806
Do you see a canister?

40:20.806 --> 40:22.074
- I-I don't know.

40:22.074 --> 40:25.477
I-I see a couple vans
and a bunch of Mexicans, but--

40:27.412 --> 40:28.547
Oh, shit.

40:28.547 --> 40:29.948
- What, Johnny?

40:29.948 --> 40:32.384
- They got something, man.
- Is it the gas?

40:32.417 --> 40:33.685
- I don't know. I don't--

40:33.719 --> 40:35.554
- What are
you waiting for?

40:35.554 --> 40:36.888
- Look, they're waiting on me.
I got to go.

40:36.922 --> 40:39.391
[line clicks, dial tone]
- Johnny? Shit.

40:39.391 --> 40:41.526
- What is it?
What's happening?

40:41.560 --> 40:43.662
- We got to get
to Los Angeles.

41:15.594 --> 41:18.030
[dog barking]
