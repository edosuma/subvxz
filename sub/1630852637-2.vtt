WEBVTT

01:00.519 --> 01:02.646
-Oh, my God, you're still here?
-Sorry.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.815
Mikey forgot the anchors.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.900
We had to send somebody
back to Conshohocken for 'em.

01:06.984 --> 01:11.154
Just please wrap this up soon.
I'm having guests.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.698
-Sure thing.
-Okay.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.715
What's going on?

01:32.134 --> 01:34.720
Sean was supposed to talk with you.
He didn't?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.437
How many people are you cooking for?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.564
Oh, shit. I was supposed to tell you.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.482
Yes, you were.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.904
Well, we'll just have to
talk it through now.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.739
That's what we'll do.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.870
Leanne, we're having
a group of people over--

01:59.953 --> 02:02.664
I told you that we can't trust strangers.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.583
Let me finish, dear.

02:06.043 --> 02:09.963
We have been
on this wait list for eight weeks,

02:10.047 --> 02:11.757
and a spot just opened up.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.218
Now, I wouldn't say yes usually,

02:14.301 --> 02:20.182
but this might be our only chance
to build a worthy community for Jericho.

02:20.265 --> 02:23.060
And what kind of mother would I be
if I didn't take that opportunity?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.436
We're a family.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.022
We're supposed to be making
these decisions together.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.233
Yes, you're right about that.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.237
I should have talked to you
about this first.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.906
And I'm sorry.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.661
We won't go through with it
if you don't feel comfortable.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.374
But if it helps,
we have all been chatting online,

02:45.457 --> 02:48.293
and I promise you,
you have nothing to worry about.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.379
These are our kind of people.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.465
They're mothers, after all. Just like me.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.467
Mothers?

02:55.551 --> 02:58.804
Yes, darling. Mommies and babies.
That's it.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.891
Jericho really needs this?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.061
Oh, he's up.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.604
I'll go. Don't worry.

03:10.983 --> 03:13.402
Do you want me to dress him
in something special?

03:13.485 --> 03:14.778
For the occasion?

03:48.270 --> 03:50.105
I finished upstairs.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.275
With the monitors.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.362
I could walk you through the setup
if you like?

03:57.446 --> 03:58.697
No, thank you.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.007
You must be Mr. Gallagher.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.093
Riley, or Mr. Smiley, for the kids.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.555
Well, hello, Mr. Smiley.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.974
-Hi.
-Welcome to our home.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.601
Leanne?

04:27.684 --> 04:29.728
Meet Mr. Smiley.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.190
He's the nice man that'll be helping out
with our mommy and me get-together.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.402
Do you wanna come over
and introduce yourself?

04:38.612 --> 04:41.657
Hello, Mr. Smiley. My name is Leanne.

04:47.538 --> 04:51.208
Yes, come. I was thinking in here.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.545
-We have a lot of room.
-Okay.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.005
Yeah!

04:59.383 --> 05:02.261
Caribbean chefs use blood
to thicken the sauce.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.221
Apparently, it's a game changer.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.098
I'm making Dominican food.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.018
How do I look?

05:10.102 --> 05:11.645
-Perfection.
-Okay.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.899
You're so good to do this for Jericho.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.237
Shall we go greet our first guest?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.072
Yes?

05:25.868 --> 05:27.411
Get rid of the goat head, Sean.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.458
Hi! Dorothy?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.586
-Yes!
-Who's your little guy?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.337
This is Jericho…

05:37.421 --> 05:40.757
-She's doing this for herself, isn't she?
-Motherhood can get lonely.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.636
She has us.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.223
Sometimes people need
a little more than that.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.270
Why don't you stay here in the kitchen
with me, until all of this is over?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.064
I could do with the extra help.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.775
Yeah.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.370
Here we go.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.457
Hello, Noah
Little bumblebee

06:13.540 --> 06:16.502
We're so glad to see you

06:16.585 --> 06:17.628
Matthew.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.881
Hello, Matthew
Little bumblebee

06:20.964 --> 06:24.051
We're so glad to see you

06:24.134 --> 06:25.344
What about Ella?

06:25.427 --> 06:28.555
Hello, Ella, little bumblebee

06:28.639 --> 06:31.183
We're so glad to see you

06:31.266 --> 06:32.434
Oh, it's okay.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.144
Oh, wait! April's sleeping. Ready?

06:34.228 --> 06:37.648
Hello, April
Little bumblebee

06:37.731 --> 06:42.486
We're so glad to see you

06:42.569 --> 06:44.071
Everybody buzz like a bee.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.286
Again!

06:59.378 --> 07:01.255
Very good!

07:01.338 --> 07:03.298
-Yay!
-Very good.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.722
What are you doing here?

07:10.806 --> 07:13.642
Dottie summoned me over
to man the surveillance.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.936
Make sure you felt safe
while the guests were here.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.272
Yeah, we got your back, girl.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.899
See? We're not gonna let
anything happen to you.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.318
Claps all around!

07:27.239 --> 07:28.699
And these are my eyes

07:28.782 --> 07:31.243
-Where?
-Upstairs, my office closet.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.536
My nose, nose, nose, nose

07:32.619 --> 07:35.122
This is my head
My shoulders, knees and toes

07:35.205 --> 07:40.544
And this is the way my body
Grows, grows, grows, grows, grows

07:40.627 --> 07:42.713
-Very good.
-Yay.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.174
-Let's do it again.
-Five, six, seven…

07:47.509 --> 07:49.845
Whoa.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.933
This shit is intense.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.573
Done. I can take it if you want.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.700
It's okay.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.256
You still feed him naturally?

08:26.340 --> 08:28.008
Oh, yes.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.553
I thought I wanted to stop,
but I miss the connection,

08:31.637 --> 08:34.556
and I want to keep him as close
as I can for as long as possible.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.852
The first course is
guinea fowl empanadas

08:39.937 --> 08:42.272
in homage to the cuisine of the Caribbean.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.901
Leanne.
Come, let me introduce you to everyone.

08:45.984 --> 08:50.614
Everyone, this is our wonderful nanny,
Leanne.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.116
She's been with us for half a year,

08:53.200 --> 08:55.202
and she is family.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.745
-Hello, everyone.
-Hi.

08:56.828 --> 08:57.746
Oh, my God.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.830
-Hey.
-Hi, Leanne.

08:58.914 --> 09:01.208
Do you wanna come join us?
We're making bird feeders.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.252
Not now. I should get back to Sean.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.754
Just for a little bit.
Here, come sit next to me.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.548
You'll be okay.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.759
-You know…
-Come.

09:11.677 --> 09:15.264
Where are you from, Leanne?
You don't sound like a Philly girl.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.474
I'm from Wisconsin.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.143
You're far from home.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.312
This is my home.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.273
Leanne is very loyal to us.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.526
It's one of the reasons
we love her so much.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.071
So, Dorothy,

09:31.154 --> 09:33.782
you must tell us what it's like
to be a local celebrity.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.077
Brian and I watch you all the time.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.453
Do you?

09:38.537 --> 09:39.788
That's so sweet.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.415
Could you pass the birdseed?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.083
-Thank you.
-Your baby.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.252
Oh! Thank you.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.297
He's quite the little escape artist.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.634
I love that piece you did

09:52.718 --> 09:55.470
on the South Philly Addiction
Recovery Center.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.183
Do you always cover
more personal material like that?

10:02.853 --> 10:03.979
What?

10:05.564 --> 10:08.442
I'd heard your brother was struggling
with substance abuse.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.362
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--

10:12.446 --> 10:14.990
I shouldn't have assumed
you'd be comfortable talking about it.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.367
No. Of course I'm comfortable
talking about it.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.788
Yes, that was something we dealt with
in the past, and…

10:24.082 --> 10:26.210
It was a really difficult time
for our family.

10:27.711 --> 10:28.837
But it's over now.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.007
Is that why there was an ambulance
outside your place?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.426
And all those police?

10:34.510 --> 10:35.928
An ambulance?

10:36.011 --> 10:37.012
No, I don't--

10:39.348 --> 10:41.725
Well, we did have that little incident
around Christmastime,

10:41.808 --> 10:44.645
but, well, that was nothing
to write home about.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.939
Christmastime? No.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.566
That wasn't it. This was in the summer.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.985
It was hot out.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.031
No, I think you must be mistaken.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.991
I don't think I am.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.576
Carrie, you remember?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.620
Yes, it was definitely summer.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.042
I can assure you it wasn't this house.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.171
I have to go help Sean in the kitchen.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.423
I wish we could hear them.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.343
Did you see that?

11:16.426 --> 11:17.553
See what?

11:17.636 --> 11:19.888
There was tension.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.933
No. You're hallucinating drama
to entertain yourself.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.478
Everyone's having a nice time.
Dorothy's happy.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.063
If you say so, maestro.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.111
Those people cannot be trusted.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.280
They're not here for her.

11:36.864 --> 11:37.906
Leanne.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.159
I don't know what to tell you.
You're safe.

11:42.119 --> 11:45.163
Julian and Veera have an eye
on the whole place.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.499
None of you can protect me from them.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.960
You wouldn't even know what to look for.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.215
Leanne, we wanna help you.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.510
But we need you tell us how.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.515
Okay, there are signs.

12:04.308 --> 12:08.520
They'll dress strangely, like how they
think normal people should dress.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.524
And they won't eat
the type of food that you make.

12:13.984 --> 12:17.070
And they'll have scars
all over their backs.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.991
Take a few deep breaths here, mother.

12:22.242 --> 12:26.079
Give thanks for this time
you've carved out for yourself

12:26.163 --> 12:27.873
and your baby.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.336
Second course is
goat-filled chocolate bonbons.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.338
A popular Dominican fare with a twist.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.925
I'm just going to set them down
by the window.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.010
And we'll start a cat cow.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.304
Inhale. Drop the belly down.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.805
And exhale.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.683
Pull the belly button towards the sky.

12:46.767 --> 12:51.230
Plant down through your fingertips
and the tops of your feet.

12:53.065 --> 12:56.443
One more cycle of
these cat cow stretches here.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.570
Inhale as you drop the belly down.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.823
Lift the heart up and exhale.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.868
Pull the belly button up towards the sky.

13:09.081 --> 13:12.835
A few deep breaths…

13:18.215 --> 13:19.883
Oh. Shit.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.678
I am so sorry, Leanne.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.879
What are you doing?

13:58.463 --> 13:59.756
Leanne.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.008
They sent you.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.219
-Nobody sent me.
-Stay back.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.015
This is my home. This is my family,

14:08.098 --> 14:11.351
and I will not let you take me away
from them.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.855
-What the hell's going on in here?
-I don't know. She just freaked out on me.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.565
No, she was looking under my bed.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.942
Ask her why she was looking under my bed.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.027
Were you?

14:20.110 --> 14:23.030
I stepped away. I just
needed some privacy to nurse Noah.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.865
I didn't know this was your room.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.450
Then why were you looking under my bed?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.493
I dropped Noah's pacifier.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.078
You're lying.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.372
No-- Listen, I'll show you.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.379
You had that in your pocket.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.381
No, it was under the bed.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.092
Fine. This is all just fine.

14:44.176 --> 14:46.428
Ma'am, I am so sorry
for the misunderstanding.

14:46.512 --> 14:49.181
I think it would be best if you
rejoined the group downstairs.

14:49.806 --> 14:50.849
Excuse me.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.684
Yeah.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.522
Babe, will you excuse us for a second?

14:56.605 --> 14:57.606
Yeah.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.489
Are you trying to
fuck this whole thing up?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.200
They're trying to kill me, Julian.
You have to help me.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.826
Enough of the dramatics, Leanne.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.663
These are rich
fucking Society Hill ladies.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.414
Do they look like they're
from some kind of cult?

15:14.498 --> 15:17.417
-No.
-Then enough, Leanne.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.004
Just let Dorothy have this day.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.507
Mommy

15:24.007 --> 15:26.552
-My mom, mom, mommy and me
-Good.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.125
This is what you wanted, wasn't it?

15:59.877 --> 16:01.795
For me to be afraid my whole life.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.843
Well, I'm not gonna run,
if that's what you think.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.680
I'm gonna wait right here for them.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.558
And I will protect my family.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.563
I'm not leaving this house.

16:38.874 --> 16:39.958
Sean.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.966
Hey there, little lady.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.220
Where is everybody?

16:51.303 --> 16:52.930
Must have stepped outside.

16:54.515 --> 16:55.557
All of them?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.853
I guess so. I was in there for a bit.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.148
Don't come any closer.
You just stay right there.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.736
There's nothing to worry about here.
I don't bite.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.864
I said stay away.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.531
There's no problem here.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.451
You okay?

17:14.535 --> 17:16.493
You're one of them, aren't you?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.749
Show me your back!

17:20.832 --> 17:22.251
Let me see your scars.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.961
Calm down, Leanne.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.170
I'll kill you.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.422
Do you understand me? I will kill you!

17:27.506 --> 17:29.424
Leanne.

17:30.676 --> 17:31.802
Put those down.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.388
What's happening?

17:34.471 --> 17:37.516
Leanne's threatening Mr. Smiley
with the kitchen shears.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.268
You left me alone.

17:40.269 --> 17:43.897
There was an ice cream truck.
We went outside for one second.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.233
Leanne, this man is not going to hurt you.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.068
Ask him to show you his back.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.403
I'm not gonna do that.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.780
If it'll help. I don't mind.

17:52.823 --> 17:55.659
Show them your back.
He'll be covered in scars.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.744
This is ridiculous.

17:59.621 --> 18:00.622
Look.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.339
Okay, put your shirt back on, Mr. Smiley.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.425
This has gotten way out of control.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.344
Everyone, why don't you head
into the living room, please.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.972
Leanne, a word.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.060
I told you, you were safe.

18:22.144 --> 18:25.981
We installed a $6,000 security system
for you.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.276
I got Julian and Veera here
to support you.

18:30.068 --> 18:33.822
I don't know what else I can possibly do
to make you feel comfortable.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.826
My God, these women
are never going to forget this.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.329
Nobody's listening to me.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.918
That is all we have been doing, Leanne.

18:50.672 --> 18:54.551
Just stay up here until they leave,
please.

18:58.222 --> 19:02.684
Everyone, I am so sorry.

19:02.768 --> 19:05.395
Leanne is going through a difficult time.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.857
You know how teenagers can be.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.486
But shall we forget all this mess
and have a toast?

19:13.153 --> 19:15.405
-Maybe? Toast?
-Maybe. Or two.

19:15.489 --> 19:20.035
Sean, you want to bring in the glasses?
Here. There we go. There we go.

19:20.118 --> 19:23.205
Thank you. And then make sure
everyone gets one, please.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.874
-Thank you.
-All right.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.753
Everyone have one?

19:29.837 --> 19:32.756
Everyone, please raise a glass.

19:34.883 --> 19:37.636
A toast to motherhood.

19:39.805 --> 19:42.683
Our journey is a tumultuous one,

19:42.766 --> 19:45.686
full of so many difficult moments.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.356
Moments of fear. Of self-doubt.

19:51.066 --> 19:56.572
But today we should celebrate ourselves.

19:57.823 --> 20:01.368
So, to all the super mommies.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.829
And daddies.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.706
-And daddies. And daddies.
-Don't forget daddies.

20:05.789 --> 20:08.417
Daddies.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.793
Cheers.

20:09.877 --> 20:12.754
Cheers!

20:14.506 --> 20:15.883
Oh, my God.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.184
I don't know where they're coming from!
Get some spray!

20:25.267 --> 20:27.728
Call a fucking exterminator!

20:28.604 --> 20:30.397
Sean's getting them!

20:38.572 --> 20:40.324
We have tres leches!

20:53.921 --> 20:55.339
How did that happen?

21:03.764 --> 21:06.725
Geez. Pretty hefty one.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.685
Looks like it got dislodged from the roof,

21:08.769 --> 21:11.647
fell all the way through the chimney,
got caught on the flue.

21:11.730 --> 21:12.814
Does that happen?

21:12.898 --> 21:15.901
It could. You had work up there?

21:16.902 --> 21:18.779
We had security cameras
installed this morning.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.405
There you go.

21:20.489 --> 21:22.866
One of those guys probably
knocked the thing down.

21:24.952 --> 21:28.539
They all came in at once.
In one second. Is that normal?

21:29.998 --> 21:32.459
Sure. When it dropped,
it probably agitated the hive

21:32.543 --> 21:34.169
and the impact made 'em go wild.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.591
My hand was right there.
I was by far the closest one.

21:39.675 --> 21:40.884
I didn't get stung once.

21:40.968 --> 21:43.929
Look, man,
if you wanna know about animal behavior,

21:44.012 --> 21:45.430
I'm not your guy.

21:45.514 --> 21:49.434
But the situation is dealt with,
and you don't have to worry anymore.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.647
-I'll bill you at the end of the week.
-Okay, thanks.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.695
Leanne must've climbed up
on the roof and knocked the hive down.

21:59.778 --> 22:01.655
And if she did, it's somewhere
on these tapes.

22:02.531 --> 22:05.409
Listen to what you're saying.
She climbed up to the roof?

22:05.492 --> 22:07.369
Is that really that insane?

22:08.704 --> 22:13.709
Okay, that girl came into this house
with a child that was probably hers.

22:13.792 --> 22:14.835
Hers?

22:16.295 --> 22:17.629
You never told me that.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.924
I always thought there was a chance.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.760
And if I'm right,

22:23.844 --> 22:28.140
there's no way that she's just content
with watching someone else play mommy.

22:31.226 --> 22:32.561
There's a price to pay.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.772
A price? Like what?

22:36.982 --> 22:38.233
Our loyalty.

22:39.610 --> 22:40.861
Dorothy.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.034
Here, let me.

23:01.215 --> 23:03.300
I just wanted Jericho to have friends.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.138
I couldn't even do that.

23:11.141 --> 23:13.977
Jericho has everything he needs
right here.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.313
So do you.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.573
Can I tell you something?

23:28.742 --> 23:30.035
It's kind of silly.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.414
You can say anything to me, Dorothy.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.086
Sometimes I feel like I'm cursed.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.258
'Cause things just keep slipping,

23:45.592 --> 23:46.677
you know?

23:49.388 --> 23:50.597
Oh, my God.

23:51.723 --> 23:54.017
Sounds so stupid coming out of my mouth.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.437
Who am I to complain?

24:01.817 --> 24:03.652
I'll put Jericho down tonight.

24:04.236 --> 24:05.821
-Yeah.
-You should get some rest.

24:12.786 --> 24:15.873
I think that everything's happening
the way that it's supposed to.

24:17.875 --> 24:18.959
Don't worry.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.504
Good night.
