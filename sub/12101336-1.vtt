WEBVTT

01:03.897 --> 01:05.148
Good evening.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.108
Good evening.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.986
I'll take your coat.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.404
Thank you.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.355
Good evening. What would you like to have?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.901
I'll have tequila. A Don Julio Añejo.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.903
Double. Two shots of it.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.197
Two shots? Sure thing.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.233
Thank you for waiting.

03:53.733 --> 03:54.651
Send one over there.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.446
Of course.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.535
Mr. Shinoda.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.498
It's from that lady over there.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.441
-One more.
-Certainly.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.075
Do you always invite guys like this?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.958
This method is easier.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.382
And you looked lonely.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.510
I did?

05:04.762 --> 05:06.472
More than anyone else here.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.144
Interesting.

05:19.861 --> 05:20.862
You don't like that?

05:33.082 --> 05:34.459
I don't dislike

05:35.376 --> 05:36.627
girls like you.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.125
Anywhere you want to go?

06:17.752 --> 06:19.128
Let's see…

06:19.879 --> 06:21.464
Your house.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.467
The Hyatt.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.762
Maybe I should go home.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.182
Why my house?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.103
It gets me excited

06:36.270 --> 06:38.856
when I have sex in a house
tidied up by someone's wife.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.611
I guess I have no choice.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.181
How much do you earn per month?

07:14.725 --> 07:16.018
I don't do this for money.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.511
What do you want me to do?

08:50.112 --> 08:51.864
Give me your wife.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.080
Your wife is the one in that photo, right?

09:01.582 --> 09:03.209
She's really cute.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.549
You're a pervert.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.301
I like that.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.332
What the fuck did you just do?

10:45.728 --> 10:47.271
THE DAY BEFORE

10:47.355 --> 10:48.481
TOKYO COSMETIC SURGERY

10:55.196 --> 10:56.864
Are you feeling okay?

10:57.365 --> 10:58.240
I'm fine.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.743
I'm going to cut the other side, then.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.703
It won't hurt, so relax.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.466
It might hurt for about three days,

11:15.549 --> 11:17.510
but try not to touch it.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.221
Keep the incision area clean,

11:20.304 --> 11:22.640
eat well, and rest well.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.854
Do I look cuter?

11:30.856 --> 11:33.317
You're one step closer
to your ideal double eyelids.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.571
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Take care.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.659
Are you done praying?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.953
-Let's go now.
-All right.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.040
-Okay.
-Let's switch. It's Grandpa's turn.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.584
-Here, Dad.
-Be careful of the steps.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.548
-Over here.
-Here you go, Kazuto and Sora.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.218
Hold this. It's hot, so be careful.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.977
-Thanks.
-Come over here.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.189
Stick it in here.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.653
Thanks. One moment.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.450
-Put your hands together.
-Here we go.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.079
Is it a boy again?

12:27.163 --> 12:31.167
Yes. It's already noisy enough,
but now we'll have six people!

12:31.250 --> 12:32.168
Shut up.

12:33.085 --> 12:37.923
Rei. You should get married soon
and show Grandpa his grandchild!

12:39.633 --> 12:41.051
Is there anyone you like?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.011
Well, I guess.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.682
-Are you Ms. Nagasawa?
-Yes.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.142
HAPPY 34TH BIRTHDAY, MIKA

12:48.225 --> 12:49.393
Is this to your liking?

12:51.061 --> 12:51.979
Yes.

12:52.062 --> 12:55.399
Oh, I'd like to have this too.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.942
-I'll put it in.
-Thanks.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.635
I'm home!

13:33.521 --> 13:35.147
Drinking again.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.987
It's dangerous, though.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.674
Welcome home!

14:01.757 --> 14:05.302
Jeez, you're drinking in the bath again.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.847
It'll be dangerous
if your blood pressure drops.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.641
With all due respect, my dear doctor,

14:11.225 --> 14:15.062
coming home to this
is what motivates me at work.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.648
Then…

14:18.315 --> 14:21.318
as an exception,

14:21.402 --> 14:24.446
-I'll pour a glass for you.
-All right!

14:26.073 --> 14:27.700
Oh, no. Sorry.

14:27.783 --> 14:31.954
It will be perfect once the princess
enters the bath with me.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.706
What?

14:37.167 --> 14:38.752
Happy birthday.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.630
One more time.

14:48.679 --> 14:52.099
Hey, you drunkard! That was dangerous!

14:52.182 --> 14:53.934
Don't do that.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.114
I'll go answer that.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.493
My blouse is wet now.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.704
This sucks.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.668
Here we go.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.049
Hello?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.426
This is Shinoda.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.638
What? Hello?

15:32.514 --> 15:33.641
This is Tsujimura.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.684
Tsujimura?

15:37.478 --> 15:38.646
Tsujimura…

15:41.357 --> 15:42.566
It's been a while.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.571
It's been some time.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.532
How have you been?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.037
I'm good.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.123
You know…

15:59.249 --> 16:01.293
You can say no if you want, but…

16:03.504 --> 16:04.588
can we meet now?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.218
Come back soon.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.097
Sorry. I guess not.

16:16.892 --> 16:17.851
I'll come.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.465
-Long time no see.
-It's been a while.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.514
What's with this room? It looks amazing.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.351
Well…

18:27.314 --> 18:29.108
You haven't changed at all.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.485
-Really?
-Yes.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.407
I mean…

18:37.491 --> 18:39.493
It's been ten years since we last met.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.454
Oh, right.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.842
How's your husband? Is he doing well?

18:56.176 --> 18:57.136
Yes.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.720
He's doing great.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.902
This is the three million yen I borrowed.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.447
Took less than five years.

19:19.741 --> 19:23.620
10 YEARS AGO

19:27.833 --> 19:29.710
What did your husband say about this?

19:31.044 --> 19:33.547
He said, "I'm sorry for
all the trouble my wife caused."

19:33.630 --> 19:34.965
He sends his best regards.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.635
He's a decent guy.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.072
I'm glad. Be happy.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.206
Let's pay separately.

20:23.263 --> 20:26.642
If you get into any trouble in the future

20:27.559 --> 20:31.021
and your husband can't help you with it,

20:31.104 --> 20:32.522
let me know anytime.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.653
We won't meet again.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.392
I love you.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.480
You're lying.

21:49.683 --> 21:50.934
What about you?

21:53.937 --> 21:55.981
Do you still love me?

23:24.820 --> 23:26.696
You think I could live a happy life…

23:29.116 --> 23:30.784
with that meager amount of money?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.207
Your husband did this?

23:46.174 --> 23:47.884
Sorry. Are you all right?

23:49.511 --> 23:50.846
I love you.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.267
What's the matter? It'll be fine.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.269
Look at me. Over here.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.366
-That hurts!
-I'm sorry!

24:22.878 --> 24:26.047
Sorry. Just go home.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.133
What?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.135
No way!

24:31.094 --> 24:32.429
I'm not going home!

24:35.724 --> 24:37.559
I can't do this anymore…

24:39.519 --> 24:41.104
Why did this happen?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.371
Where did you go?

24:58.455 --> 25:01.249
-I've been waiting for you.
-Sorry.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.835
-Who were you with? Tell me!
-Sorry.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.796
Who did you go out with? Spill it!

25:06.880 --> 25:09.341
Who was it? Tell me!

25:09.424 --> 25:11.885
Tell me! Who were you with?

25:19.059 --> 25:22.145
Either my husband dies, or I die.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.486
If you're going to die,
your husband deserves to die!

25:40.247 --> 25:41.164
If that's the case…

25:45.460 --> 25:46.920
will you kill him for me?

26:10.443 --> 26:11.319
Hello?

26:13.572 --> 26:14.906
It's over.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.451
It's all over.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.749
I left fingerprints
and was caught on camera, too.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.960
What are you talking about?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.967
By the time you're home,
the police will be looking for me.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.720
Wait a minute.

26:40.807 --> 26:44.811
The police won't investigate further
so long as they know who the murderer is.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.815
They won't know you instigated the murder.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.114
Where are you?

26:59.576 --> 27:00.452
Hey!

29:01.698 --> 29:02.741
Get in.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.411
Hurry up.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.544
Where are we going?

29:58.171 --> 29:59.756
Anywhere.

30:11.100 --> 30:14.145
No one is going to hit you
or kick you anymore!

30:50.306 --> 30:51.516
Hey!

31:53.828 --> 31:56.205
Sorry, can I use the toilet?

32:00.335 --> 32:02.545
Sorry. I didn't want you to see this.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.389
So he's dead?

32:21.731 --> 32:23.483
He's dead, and I killed him.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.783
And I lost my virginity at 29 years old.

33:03.982 --> 33:04.857
Hey.

33:05.441 --> 33:06.359
Can I join you?

34:01.330 --> 34:02.498
What's wrong?

34:07.879 --> 34:09.964
I was almost killed.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.935
If you two stabbed each other,

34:23.519 --> 34:25.271
it would have all ended right there.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.216
You're right.

34:56.761 --> 34:57.887
I'm sorry.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.643
Get mad at me.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.743
What will they call me?

35:23.412 --> 35:25.790
A home-wrecker
who was jealous of his wife…

35:30.169 --> 35:33.714
…or the lesbian fool
who was jealous of her crush's husband?

35:59.073 --> 36:01.659
You smile when you lie.

36:08.749 --> 36:11.127
And you look really cute when you do it.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.601
My entire life crumbles…

36:28.936 --> 36:32.398
with just a single smile of yours!

36:55.546 --> 36:58.049
-Good work.
-Good work.

37:03.596 --> 37:04.764
Over there.

37:04.847 --> 37:07.016
After questioning the neighbor,

37:07.099 --> 37:09.143
we were informed that
at 10:40 p.m. yesterday,

37:09.227 --> 37:11.687
they heard sounds of objects crashing

37:11.771 --> 37:14.565
and someone falling down,
so they alerted the security guard.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.483
I see.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.400
Okay.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.861
-May I have a moment, Chief?
-Go ahead.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.574
He slumped down here and died.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.285
Nasty business.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.578
It really is.

39:09.221 --> 39:12.475
At first, I thought it would be easier
to use gasoline.

39:12.558 --> 39:14.101
Burn the place down.

39:15.561 --> 39:16.812
Why didn't you do that?

39:18.439 --> 39:21.192
I thought you'd get lonely without a home.

39:23.235 --> 39:25.654
I never had a home in the first place.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.368
I'd get beat up for just existing

39:30.451 --> 39:32.411
by my dad and my husband.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.366
His alcoholism triggered a stroke.

40:10.449 --> 40:12.368
He's been in a vegetative state for years.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.790
I wanted to let the bastard die,

40:17.873 --> 40:20.126
but he was kept alive
for my husband's good image.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.301
But that ends today.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.473
I'm hungry.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.183
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

40:46.485 --> 40:47.945
Goodbye, Dad.

41:06.213 --> 41:07.840
I don't have much money on me.

41:10.509 --> 41:13.429
Welcome. Please place your order
through the microphone.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.599
I was going to turn myself in afterward.

41:17.558 --> 41:20.519
Let's see. A teriyaki burger and cola.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.313
I don't have much with me, either.

41:22.396 --> 41:23.647
Okay, teriyaki and a cola.

41:23.731 --> 41:24.982
A cheeseburger, please.

41:25.065 --> 41:26.442
Of course.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.360
I was supposed to come home from a trip

41:28.444 --> 41:30.946
to discover that a burglar
killed my husband.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.658
Thank you for your order.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.577
If that will be all,

41:36.660 --> 41:38.579
-please drive around.
-Got it.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.376
Welcome.

41:44.460 --> 41:47.546
I'll be receiving your payment first.
It's 1,080 yen in total.

41:48.839 --> 41:49.965
Thanks.

41:51.091 --> 41:52.968
-Here you go.
-2,000 yen.

41:53.594 --> 41:54.720
Oh, excuse me.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.263
-Yes?
-Can I have fries, too?

41:56.347 --> 41:57.848
Yes, certainly.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.327
I don't want it to stand out.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.830
Should we just drown ourselves somewhere?

42:21.914 --> 42:25.000
-No, I don't like that!
-Why?

42:25.084 --> 42:26.710
Your corpse will swell up,

42:26.794 --> 42:28.796
you'll get sticky,
and insects will eat you.

42:28.879 --> 42:31.006
-Really?
-There's no way I'm doing that.

42:38.013 --> 42:41.308
-Blow ourselves up using kerosene?
-Kerosene doesn't explode.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.851
-Really?
-Yes!

42:42.935 --> 42:44.144
Really?

42:45.062 --> 42:46.564
-Actually…
-Yes?

42:46.647 --> 42:50.109
I killed someone to save you,
so why are you trying to die now?

42:51.277 --> 42:52.444
I mean…

42:53.571 --> 42:56.282
is there any future for me if I'm alive?

43:04.248 --> 43:05.374
What are you doing?

43:11.046 --> 43:11.964
Pick one.

43:14.049 --> 43:14.967
I'll go with B.

43:15.050 --> 43:16.260
-B?
-Yes.

43:24.727 --> 43:25.894
-You landed here.
-Okay.

43:27.521 --> 43:28.355
Ta-da!

43:28.439 --> 43:29.273
DEAD END

43:33.360 --> 43:34.778
What's with that?

43:37.906 --> 43:38.991
-Hey.
-What?

43:39.074 --> 43:40.367
What should we do next?

43:42.828 --> 43:43.912
-Hey.
-Yes?

43:43.996 --> 43:45.748
I want to go to your parents' home.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.249
Why?

43:47.333 --> 43:50.586
I met your husband and saw where you live.

43:51.086 --> 43:52.296
I met your father too.

43:53.213 --> 43:55.382
I want to know more about you.

44:40.969 --> 44:42.513
I'm coming in.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.001
Satisfied now?

45:24.263 --> 45:26.181
I lived here until I was 18.

45:28.058 --> 45:31.770
My mom left after she got another man,
and I haven't seen her since then.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.399
After my mom left,

45:35.482 --> 45:37.860
my dad beat me,
as if I were her replacement.

45:41.739 --> 45:45.325
It's as you said.
I had to sell my body to live.

45:47.661 --> 45:51.665
That's why I chose the person
willing to buy me at the highest price

45:51.749 --> 45:54.209
when I was worth the most.

46:01.091 --> 46:03.594
I realized how much my life was worth.

46:04.887 --> 46:09.850
I've used up my 29 years' worth
of luck, self-esteem, and rights.

46:10.976 --> 46:12.853
And now I only have you.

46:15.522 --> 46:16.774
What a cruel world.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.276
You're right.

46:21.987 --> 46:23.614
Why aren't you mad?

46:25.282 --> 46:28.994
It makes me want to
give you a pat on the back.

46:30.537 --> 46:32.498
It's so tiring to be with you.

46:41.006 --> 46:42.424
I'm going for a smoke.

47:04.279 --> 47:06.698
FIRST PLACE 100M HURDLES
NANAE TSUJIMURA

47:22.840 --> 47:23.757
Set!

47:41.066 --> 47:42.192
That's 14.5 seconds!

47:42.276 --> 47:44.736
-All right!
-You broke your record, Tsujimura!

47:44.820 --> 47:46.822
-Yes!
-All right!

47:46.905 --> 47:48.907
-Is this the first time you broke 14?
-Yes!

47:48.991 --> 47:51.952
You're doing so well today.
I couldn't catch up to you!

47:52.035 --> 47:55.163
-Think I can do it?
-Of course!

47:55.247 --> 47:57.749
-You can do it!
-Thanks!

47:58.667 --> 48:00.002
That's amazing!

48:16.727 --> 48:18.395
She was watching today, too.

48:18.478 --> 48:22.482
I heard she's actually a lesbian,
so be careful.

48:22.566 --> 48:25.736
But she seems nice.
Being gay isn't harmful or anything.

48:25.819 --> 48:29.364
Wow, she just called her harmful.

48:30.365 --> 48:33.577
-Let's go eat some ice cream.
-Let's go.

48:56.516 --> 48:57.476
What's wrong?

49:07.653 --> 49:09.821
These chocolates are so expensive!

49:09.905 --> 49:13.575
Can you afford this with your
high-schooler's allowance?

49:18.246 --> 49:19.206
I want tea.

49:21.416 --> 49:22.334
Okay, then.

49:23.251 --> 49:24.211
All right.

49:31.259 --> 49:32.886
I bet your allowance

49:33.720 --> 49:36.390
is more than my salary.

49:54.825 --> 49:56.535
-Here.
-Thanks.

50:05.002 --> 50:07.087
I wish I was your true love.

50:08.296 --> 50:09.256
What?

50:28.525 --> 50:29.443
Hey.

50:31.570 --> 50:32.654
Let's kiss.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.157
No, it's my first kiss.

50:37.534 --> 50:38.493
Hey!

50:39.244 --> 50:40.328
Geez.

50:42.581 --> 50:43.999
Come here.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.001
Where are you going?

50:46.501 --> 50:47.377
The restroom.

51:06.438 --> 51:09.232
I told you, forget about
that straight girl.

51:12.444 --> 51:14.112
Sooner or later

51:15.030 --> 51:17.157
she'll be sucking some guy's… you know.

51:23.705 --> 51:24.790
That's true.

51:33.757 --> 51:37.594
-What time do we start tomorrow?
-I think it's 8:00 a.m.

51:37.677 --> 51:38.929
All right.

51:41.723 --> 51:42.599
Hey.

51:47.938 --> 51:50.398
-I'll go ahead.
-Got it.

51:53.819 --> 51:54.986
You're still here?

51:55.529 --> 51:58.156
I had supplementary lessons today.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.699
Shall we walk home together?

52:00.575 --> 52:01.409
Yes.

52:10.877 --> 52:13.046
You're always working hard at practice.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.924
I'm aiming for the top three
in the Inter-High.

52:16.007 --> 52:18.802
That's incredible!
Didn't you only start at high school?

52:19.344 --> 52:21.388
Right. There's a lot of pressure!

52:22.264 --> 52:23.557
I'm sure you can do it.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.017
Thanks.

52:36.403 --> 52:39.447
-I'll go look at some track spikes.
-Oh, bye then.

53:36.129 --> 53:37.631
Wait a minute!

53:37.714 --> 53:39.424
Hold on!

53:43.345 --> 53:44.512
Wait!

53:45.013 --> 53:46.389
Hey, wait!

53:46.473 --> 53:47.849
Stop!

53:49.809 --> 53:51.853
I'm telling you to stop!

53:52.479 --> 53:54.439
Come back!

53:54.522 --> 53:55.899
-Stop!
-Stop running!

53:56.483 --> 53:57.776
-Hey!
-Wait!

53:58.318 --> 54:01.321
-Hey…
-Wait, damn it!

54:01.404 --> 54:02.989
Stop!

54:03.073 --> 54:05.242
Stop running!

54:07.160 --> 54:09.621
-That hurt.
-Move aside.

54:09.704 --> 54:11.831
-I'm going to check your bag.
-Wait a minute!

54:11.915 --> 54:13.583
She took a pair of shoes, right?

54:13.667 --> 54:15.710
-We got you!
-I'll buy it!

54:15.794 --> 54:18.546
No, we'll hand her over to the police.

54:18.630 --> 54:19.798
This covers it, right?

54:20.340 --> 54:21.258
What?

54:21.967 --> 54:23.468
-Let's go.
-Wait…

54:25.679 --> 54:28.640
Money is not the issue here.

54:30.767 --> 54:31.685
Hey!

55:14.185 --> 55:15.603
I heard you're quitting school.

55:17.230 --> 55:20.650
I only got into such a good place
through my sports scholarship.

55:22.694 --> 55:24.904
Can't you come back
after your leg recovers?

55:26.448 --> 55:28.825
I can't buy spikes because I'm poor,

55:28.908 --> 55:31.703
and I can't get proper rehab
for my injured leg.

55:31.786 --> 55:33.121
Thus, this is the result.

55:38.668 --> 55:40.253
This is embarrassing.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.589
A rich girl like you
had to see me like that.

55:49.262 --> 55:52.640
And I was so sure of my running
and shoplifting abilities.

55:58.229 --> 56:00.398
What are you going to do from now on?

56:01.149 --> 56:04.611
No idea. Probably live
somewhere that you'll never go.

56:07.864 --> 56:08.990
That's enough talk.

56:25.882 --> 56:26.925
If that's the case,

56:27.467 --> 56:30.011
I'll pay for the rest
of your time in high school!

56:32.847 --> 56:34.808
How much were our school fees again?

56:34.891 --> 56:37.102
Two million yen? Or three million yen?

56:38.686 --> 56:41.022
If you're just going to sell
your body to men,

56:41.106 --> 56:43.024
what's the difference in me buying you?

56:48.363 --> 56:50.240
Let's change these lame glasses, too.

56:53.118 --> 56:54.411
Who do you think you are?

56:56.621 --> 56:57.789
I'm a rich girl.

57:00.625 --> 57:01.668
What do you want?

57:04.254 --> 57:05.213
Five years.

57:07.674 --> 57:08.883
I'll wait five years.

57:10.343 --> 57:12.053
If you can't pay me back by then,

57:13.388 --> 57:14.597
let me have sex with you.

57:33.116 --> 57:34.367
You'd hate that, right?

57:34.451 --> 57:36.077
Sounds harmful, doesn't it?

57:38.997 --> 57:41.791
If you don't want a girl's fingers
inside you,

57:41.875 --> 57:45.503
go work in a proper company
and get married to some rich guy.

58:16.826 --> 58:18.036
Damn!

58:18.119 --> 58:21.539
"Caught speeding.
Pay three thousand dollars."

58:22.165 --> 58:24.876
My first fine ever in life.

58:31.049 --> 58:32.425
I called the police.

58:35.094 --> 58:36.721
I want to start over from scratch.

58:37.889 --> 58:39.849
You said you'll take the blame, right?

58:41.684 --> 58:44.187
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

58:45.313 --> 58:46.272
Save me.

59:20.682 --> 59:23.059
You could've at least
let me fuck you first!

59:27.397 --> 59:29.274
There's no time to do it now!

1:00:31.919 --> 1:00:34.172
Thanks for waiting. Kamegame Sushi.

1:00:37.342 --> 1:00:38.801
That will be 6,000 yen, please.

1:00:47.352 --> 1:00:48.227
Well,

1:00:49.604 --> 1:00:52.649
I wondered what you'd say
if I told you I called the police.

1:00:55.693 --> 1:00:56.903
I was worried.

1:00:57.862 --> 1:00:59.947
Since you don't get mad
no matter what I say.

1:01:26.307 --> 1:01:27.225
I'm sorry.

1:01:31.896 --> 1:01:33.189
It must have hurt.

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:47.995
I was going to tell the police
I forced you to come with me.

1:01:48.955 --> 1:01:50.331
That's what I would tell them.

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:54.377
They shouldn't see us happily drinking,

1:01:55.086 --> 1:01:57.046
so I wanted you to be afraid of me.

1:01:59.549 --> 1:02:00.967
Even so…

1:02:03.052 --> 1:02:04.846
After I hit you,

1:02:04.929 --> 1:02:06.806
I saw how scared you really were.

1:02:13.563 --> 1:02:16.274
That was the worst thing I could've done.

1:02:24.490 --> 1:02:25.700
I'm sorry.

1:02:39.630 --> 1:02:41.215
This is the end.

1:02:51.225 --> 1:02:52.769
We can't run anymore.

1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:11.287
Why are we having sushi anyway?

1:03:13.539 --> 1:03:14.957
It's our last meal.

1:03:16.793 --> 1:03:19.003
I can't eat raw fish.

1:03:19.921 --> 1:03:22.673
-Really?
-Actually…

1:03:22.757 --> 1:03:26.135
it's pretty cliché to have
sushi as a last meal.

1:03:28.346 --> 1:03:30.431
Well, I'm sorry.

1:03:30.515 --> 1:03:33.309
It's a cliché luxury that
poor people like me want.

1:03:43.194 --> 1:03:44.445
I'm sorry.

1:03:50.701 --> 1:03:52.411
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

1:04:28.573 --> 1:04:31.284
We still haven't had our last meal!

1:04:31.367 --> 1:04:33.369
You two! Stop!

1:04:33.452 --> 1:04:34.495
Stop!

1:04:45.089 --> 1:04:46.090
Hold up!

1:04:52.388 --> 1:04:54.140
-What?
-Get on!

1:04:54.223 --> 1:04:55.892
Hey!

1:04:55.975 --> 1:04:58.853
-I'm sorry!
-Wait a minute!

1:04:59.395 --> 1:05:00.855
Stop right there!

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:07.904
This is PC107.

1:05:08.487 --> 1:05:11.699
I'm in pursuit of two
suspicious individuals!

1:05:11.782 --> 1:05:13.117
This is PC107.

1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:15.554
Mom?

1:06:16.180 --> 1:06:17.598
What's going on?

1:06:17.682 --> 1:06:20.309
You're sleeping in this late?

1:06:20.393 --> 1:06:21.978
Playing hooky?

1:06:22.061 --> 1:06:23.604
Why are you here?

1:06:24.397 --> 1:06:26.649
I had something to do in the neighborhood.

1:06:26.732 --> 1:06:29.110
I texted you, didn't I?

1:06:34.991 --> 1:06:36.367
Also,

1:06:36.450 --> 1:06:39.328
your dad went for an arrhythmia checkup.

1:06:40.413 --> 1:06:42.999
It cost around 80,000 yen,

1:06:43.082 --> 1:06:47.086
but turns out he's fit as a fiddle.

1:06:48.004 --> 1:06:50.131
Oh well, as long as he's healthy.

1:06:50.881 --> 1:06:53.092
But we don't know if the doctor's a quack.

1:07:00.433 --> 1:07:02.101
How's your girlfriend?

1:07:03.561 --> 1:07:04.812
She's not home today?

1:07:08.524 --> 1:07:09.734
Sorry.

1:07:09.817 --> 1:07:11.485
Oh, well…

1:07:13.446 --> 1:07:14.530
She…

1:07:15.906 --> 1:07:17.575
I think she left.

1:07:20.161 --> 1:07:21.620
You're not sure?

1:07:24.915 --> 1:07:26.042
You know,

1:07:26.625 --> 1:07:29.837
that's what I don't like about her.

1:07:32.048 --> 1:07:36.135
She didn't introduce you
to her parents, either.

1:07:39.221 --> 1:07:41.307
She said her parents would be hurt

1:07:41.390 --> 1:07:43.225
if they knew their daughter was gay.

1:07:44.518 --> 1:07:45.519
So…

1:07:46.771 --> 1:07:49.231
she said filial piety dictates
she shouldn't tell them.

1:07:53.194 --> 1:07:57.656
What? She's taking you for a fool.
She's just afraid to tell them.

1:08:08.375 --> 1:08:09.335
You know,

1:08:10.127 --> 1:08:12.213
when you brought her to me and your dad,

1:08:13.547 --> 1:08:16.092
you mustered all your courage

1:08:16.175 --> 1:08:17.551
and introduced her to us.

1:08:19.428 --> 1:08:22.848
I was happy.

1:08:24.558 --> 1:08:28.729
But that girl acted as if
none of this was any of her concern.

1:08:48.541 --> 1:08:50.126
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

1:08:53.629 --> 1:08:54.505
Mom.

1:08:56.966 --> 1:08:58.050
I'm sorry.

1:09:00.553 --> 1:09:01.762
What for?

1:09:06.475 --> 1:09:08.644
I'm 34 years old,

1:09:10.604 --> 1:09:11.897
and I'm still like this.

1:09:17.194 --> 1:09:19.363
I couldn't give you a grandchild.

1:09:23.409 --> 1:09:25.119
What are you saying?

1:09:25.202 --> 1:09:27.538
You're still the same, even at this age.

1:09:28.789 --> 1:09:30.457
Such a crybaby

1:09:30.541 --> 1:09:32.209
and always acting so spoiled.

1:09:47.099 --> 1:09:49.393
Anyway, you look older now.

1:09:51.937 --> 1:09:54.481
I can see those laugh lines on your face.

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:24.011
-Hey!
-What's wrong?

1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:26.555
-Oh, no!
-Wait…

1:10:26.639 --> 1:10:28.098
What?

1:10:28.182 --> 1:10:29.558
One minute.

1:10:43.113 --> 1:10:44.114
No good.

1:10:45.282 --> 1:10:47.326
-We're out of gas.
-No way.

1:10:47.409 --> 1:10:51.747
CAFETERIA HIROSATO

1:10:52.706 --> 1:10:53.582
After you.

1:10:55.459 --> 1:10:56.877
Welcome.

1:10:56.961 --> 1:10:58.045
Table for two, please.

1:10:58.963 --> 1:11:00.339
-This way.
-Okay.

1:11:16.647 --> 1:11:19.608
Beer has never tasted so good!

1:11:45.342 --> 1:11:46.969
-That's good!
-I know, right?

1:11:57.521 --> 1:11:59.106
It is good, isn't it?

1:12:07.364 --> 1:12:10.367
I think it's the first time
I've seen you make that face.

1:12:28.761 --> 1:12:30.054
I'm heading to the washroom.

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:39.188
BUSINESSMAN SLAUGHTERED

1:12:39.271 --> 1:12:41.732
SOCIALITE COUPLE'S DARKNESS
PROSTITUTE'S TWISTED LOVE

1:12:59.124 --> 1:13:01.502
You guys look like you're having fun.

1:13:03.087 --> 1:13:04.838
Sorry we were so noisy.

1:13:05.881 --> 1:13:09.718
Did you lose your shoes?

1:13:10.844 --> 1:13:11.887
Yes.

1:13:13.097 --> 1:13:14.348
Are you all right?

1:13:15.891 --> 1:13:16.892
Please don't mind me.

1:13:29.488 --> 1:13:32.199
How can we repay you?

1:13:32.282 --> 1:13:36.036
I can't just leave you two alone.
You stick out like a sore thumb.

1:13:39.206 --> 1:13:41.458
Where did you girls come from? Tokyo?

1:13:42.167 --> 1:13:44.128
You don't look like locals.

1:13:44.211 --> 1:13:46.380
Or vacationers, for that matter.

1:13:46.463 --> 1:13:47.965
Are you two here for work?

1:13:49.383 --> 1:13:51.427
We're on the run after killing someone.

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:56.473
Since you saw our faces,
we'll have to kill you too.

1:14:06.608 --> 1:14:08.861
I was in Tokyo until last year.

1:14:09.862 --> 1:14:11.947
My company went under
and I came back here.

1:14:12.030 --> 1:14:14.116
It's really boring here.

1:14:14.700 --> 1:14:16.869
I'm just waiting for time to pass.

1:14:18.662 --> 1:14:22.458
My company failed, I was in debt…

1:14:23.292 --> 1:14:25.419
I even raised a hand to my wife and kid.

1:14:26.295 --> 1:14:29.715
I received a restraining order,
so I can't see them anymore.

1:14:35.345 --> 1:14:39.641
My wife looks like you. Just a little.

1:14:42.144 --> 1:14:43.770
That's why I helped you.

1:15:01.038 --> 1:15:03.165
Thank you for your help.

1:15:15.219 --> 1:15:18.430
Maybe we should've asked him
to drive us a bit further.

1:15:18.514 --> 1:15:21.391
It's fine as long as
we're sleeping under a roof.

1:15:28.941 --> 1:15:30.275
I'll take a nap.

1:16:58.697 --> 1:17:00.824
I knew it. You two are still here.

1:17:05.704 --> 1:17:08.707
Is it really true that you killed someone?

1:17:13.337 --> 1:17:15.005
That's a scary face.

1:17:17.799 --> 1:17:19.676
I wanted to have a drink with you.

1:17:29.227 --> 1:17:31.063
Where will you run away to?

1:17:32.105 --> 1:17:33.231
No idea.

1:17:34.399 --> 1:17:36.109
I wonder what's next.

1:17:37.486 --> 1:17:39.571
Trying to escape from reality?

1:17:39.655 --> 1:17:40.947
How old are you, young lady?

1:17:43.283 --> 1:17:44.368
I'm 23 years old.

1:17:46.244 --> 1:17:47.996
No way!

1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:50.040
You look way more mature for your age.

1:17:51.166 --> 1:17:52.751
You got me!

1:17:53.460 --> 1:17:54.795
I'm 29.

1:17:59.633 --> 1:18:00.967
Your hair is beautiful.

1:18:13.355 --> 1:18:14.898
You like this, right?

1:19:11.246 --> 1:19:12.748
Can we really do it raw?

1:19:15.167 --> 1:19:17.669
I knew that you would understand me.

1:20:34.871 --> 1:20:35.914
Hey.

1:20:43.046 --> 1:20:44.256
Here.

1:20:49.219 --> 1:20:51.429
I don't know what happened to you,

1:20:52.347 --> 1:20:53.348
but take this.

1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:35.283
Hello?

1:22:43.416 --> 1:22:44.250
Rei?

1:22:52.550 --> 1:22:53.677
It's you, isn't it?

1:22:59.432 --> 1:23:00.725
Are you…

1:23:03.436 --> 1:23:05.188
Are you all right?

1:23:09.150 --> 1:23:10.527
I'm sorry.

1:23:14.864 --> 1:23:16.032
You're…

1:23:18.034 --> 1:23:20.203
not coming back, are you?

1:23:24.582 --> 1:23:25.667
Sorry.

1:23:27.669 --> 1:23:30.338
Don't apologize like it's nothing.

1:23:35.010 --> 1:23:36.511
I…

1:23:39.639 --> 1:23:41.975
I don't have a clue…

1:23:43.518 --> 1:23:44.894
what you've been doing.

1:23:49.274 --> 1:23:51.026
You didn't call.

1:23:54.988 --> 1:23:56.364
And I don't even know…

1:23:58.616 --> 1:24:00.368
where you're at.

1:24:08.752 --> 1:24:09.919
I know…

1:24:15.717 --> 1:24:19.888
I'm talking to myself, but…

1:24:24.017 --> 1:24:25.101
the fact that…

1:24:30.482 --> 1:24:32.150
I could only

1:24:33.318 --> 1:24:34.903
like girls…

1:24:38.073 --> 1:24:41.242
Ever since I was a child…

1:24:44.287 --> 1:24:46.915
I was worried about it,
just like anyone else would.

1:24:57.801 --> 1:24:59.594
But after I went out with you…

1:25:06.101 --> 1:25:07.811
For the first time in my life…

1:25:13.900 --> 1:25:15.610
I was glad that…

1:25:17.612 --> 1:25:19.030
I was born

1:25:20.448 --> 1:25:21.825
a gay woman.

1:25:37.132 --> 1:25:38.258
Now…

1:25:47.350 --> 1:25:51.062
…you're with the person you love, right?

1:26:14.836 --> 1:26:16.254
I'm glad.

1:26:27.265 --> 1:26:28.641
Goodbye.

1:27:48.221 --> 1:27:49.180
Hey.

1:27:51.391 --> 1:27:52.642
What do you want to do?

1:28:00.817 --> 1:28:02.485
We could die together.

1:28:04.070 --> 1:28:05.780
Or we could go to the police, too.

1:28:34.142 --> 1:28:35.560
I want to take a shower.

1:28:38.896 --> 1:28:40.481
And I want to sleep on a futon.

1:29:08.468 --> 1:29:09.635
Us two…

1:29:10.345 --> 1:29:12.764
we're not friends, nor are we lovers.

1:29:16.225 --> 1:29:21.397
But I'm not against having a good talk
with you during our remaining time.

1:30:55.074 --> 1:30:56.492
That was you, Ms. Nagasawa?

1:30:57.285 --> 1:31:00.079
It's been dangerous around here recently,

1:31:00.163 --> 1:31:01.664
so please don't do that again.

1:31:01.747 --> 1:31:05.460
Sorry to trouble you. I lost my key.

1:31:15.178 --> 1:31:17.555
So you really are rich, huh?

1:31:18.681 --> 1:31:20.266
This place belongs to my dad.

1:31:25.897 --> 1:31:28.483
-It's tasty!
-Yes.

1:31:30.234 --> 1:31:31.569
You can't cook at all?

1:31:31.652 --> 1:31:34.739
You can have all the good food
you want if you can pay for it.

1:31:36.908 --> 1:31:38.868
You had someone to cook for you, right?

1:31:42.038 --> 1:31:43.080
I did.

1:31:56.886 --> 1:31:58.346
My mother

1:31:59.222 --> 1:32:02.016
refused to accept that I was gay
until the very end.

1:32:03.518 --> 1:32:06.812
So I asked my male friend
to pretend to be my boyfriend.

1:32:08.356 --> 1:32:12.443
Then my mom told me, "I'm glad
you're cured of your homosexuality."

1:32:17.031 --> 1:32:19.033
And then she died a while after that.

1:32:24.288 --> 1:32:26.958
I don't want to be rejected
by anyone again.

1:32:27.041 --> 1:32:29.210
I don't care if they don't understand me.

1:32:32.338 --> 1:32:35.466
As long as I come to terms with it,
I can have a decent life.

1:32:39.345 --> 1:32:40.888
But when I saw you,

1:32:41.389 --> 1:32:44.350
the love I felt for you in high school
came rushing back.

1:32:47.979 --> 1:32:52.316
I always wished I could be
the person you had by your side.

1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:54.110
It all came back to me.

1:33:30.354 --> 1:33:33.274
I WONDER IF THE WIFE WAS KILLED TOO

1:33:33.357 --> 1:33:35.318
HURRY AND IDENTIFY HER

1:33:35.401 --> 1:33:36.819
REIWA GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNA

1:33:46.787 --> 1:33:48.164
I'll get the offal rice bowl.

1:33:48.247 --> 1:33:50.833
-I'll have the beef rice bowl.
-Thanks.

1:33:57.590 --> 1:34:00.176
Excuse me.
May we have a moment of your time?

1:34:03.012 --> 1:34:04.930
We'd like to speak with you.

1:34:48.265 --> 1:34:49.975
Why are you here, Masato?

1:34:51.394 --> 1:34:53.813
The security guard called us.

1:34:53.896 --> 1:34:56.899
He thought it was a burglar,
but it was you.

1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:02.822
The person on the news.

1:35:03.864 --> 1:35:05.366
That wasn't you, right?

1:35:09.995 --> 1:35:10.830
What?

1:35:11.497 --> 1:35:13.708
No way. Wait…

1:35:15.209 --> 1:35:16.127
Seriously?

1:35:23.259 --> 1:35:24.510
That woman…

1:35:26.095 --> 1:35:27.805
Is she that man's wife?

1:35:30.891 --> 1:35:32.351
I'm sorry.

1:35:33.978 --> 1:35:36.856
Seriously, what are you doing?

1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:01.672
I'm sorry for the precautions.

1:36:02.506 --> 1:36:06.093
Things would get messy
if you were to escape.

1:36:06.886 --> 1:36:07.762
I understand.

1:36:10.264 --> 1:36:13.768
I'm… Rei's sister-in-law.

1:36:15.394 --> 1:36:19.023
Are you two together?

1:36:20.858 --> 1:36:23.819
No. It's not like that.

1:36:26.322 --> 1:36:29.992
Then why are you two
running away together?

1:38:07.923 --> 1:38:10.050
Why would you do this?

1:38:13.470 --> 1:38:16.056
What is that woman in the glasses to you?

1:38:23.898 --> 1:38:26.150
She's not the girl
you've been with for ages.

1:38:28.944 --> 1:38:29.945
You knew?

1:38:31.447 --> 1:38:34.033
I've wondered about it many times before.

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:42.791
Do you have feelings for her?

1:38:48.464 --> 1:38:51.717
Say something. I won't understand
if you don't explain it.

1:39:02.645 --> 1:39:04.730
There's only one thing you can do.

1:39:06.315 --> 1:39:09.234
Turn yourself in
and atone for what you've done.

1:39:10.611 --> 1:39:12.237
Don't commit any more crimes.

1:39:26.126 --> 1:39:27.211
All right.

1:39:29.588 --> 1:39:31.298
I'll go tomorrow morning.

1:39:32.383 --> 1:39:33.384
Go now.

1:39:37.262 --> 1:39:39.348
The sooner the better,
even if only a little.

1:39:39.932 --> 1:39:41.475
Do it now and show you're sincere.

1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:45.521
Then…

1:39:47.731 --> 1:39:49.817
come back sooner, even if only a little.

1:39:53.821 --> 1:39:56.240
There'll be a home waiting for you.

1:40:23.100 --> 1:40:24.601
What are you doing?

1:40:29.606 --> 1:40:31.692
I was thinking about
jumping out and dying.

1:40:41.285 --> 1:40:42.286
Sorry.

1:40:43.954 --> 1:40:45.372
We've been found.

1:41:03.015 --> 1:41:06.018
My brother is going to drive me
to the police station now.

1:41:10.439 --> 1:41:14.526
I'll say that I kidnapped
and imprisoned you.

1:41:18.739 --> 1:41:20.908
Did your brother agree to it?

1:41:22.326 --> 1:41:23.327
Yes.

1:41:27.706 --> 1:41:30.209
I got him to understand.

1:41:33.253 --> 1:41:34.963
We ran when it was just us,

1:41:35.047 --> 1:41:36.924
but now your family is here, you do this.

1:41:38.300 --> 1:41:39.176
What?

1:41:40.969 --> 1:41:42.513
Just do whatever you want.

1:41:43.013 --> 1:41:44.932
I'm just a stranger.

1:41:45.015 --> 1:41:47.559
-Why are you mad?
-I'm not.

1:41:47.643 --> 1:41:49.186
I just don't want to talk to you.

1:41:50.771 --> 1:41:53.524
Just go to the police with your brother
for all I care!

1:42:02.699 --> 1:42:03.659
Sorry.

1:42:07.246 --> 1:42:08.247
I see.

1:42:10.457 --> 1:42:11.625
You feel lonely?

1:42:17.256 --> 1:42:18.590
Hey! Careful!

1:42:18.674 --> 1:42:21.510
I hate it when you're so insensitive!

1:42:21.593 --> 1:42:22.719
You're not a kid!

1:42:22.803 --> 1:42:24.388
-Stop sulking!
-Shut up!

1:42:24.471 --> 1:42:26.765
Hey, what are you two doing?

1:42:26.849 --> 1:42:28.058
Calm down!

1:42:28.142 --> 1:42:29.768
You're so pathetic!

1:42:29.852 --> 1:42:31.770
Are you pitying me?

1:42:31.854 --> 1:42:34.439
My brother asked me just now.

1:42:34.523 --> 1:42:38.569
He said, "What do you think of her?"
And that's when I realized.

1:42:38.652 --> 1:42:40.696
You're a pathetic person!

1:42:41.446 --> 1:42:45.576
You can't think of any ideas to escape
from your husband, and here you are…

1:42:45.659 --> 1:42:49.997
This only happened because
you actually killed him for real!

1:42:51.206 --> 1:42:52.749
You bitch!

1:42:52.833 --> 1:42:54.710
That's right!

1:42:54.793 --> 1:42:56.628
I mean…

1:42:56.712 --> 1:42:59.298
You're just so damn pathetic!

1:42:59.381 --> 1:43:00.507
Shut up!

1:43:00.591 --> 1:43:02.551
Just shut up already!

1:43:17.524 --> 1:43:18.609
You know…

1:43:19.902 --> 1:43:21.945
once you've atoned for what you've done,

1:43:22.029 --> 1:43:23.572
go find a good guy

1:43:23.655 --> 1:43:26.033
and try making a good family
and have a kid.

1:43:26.116 --> 1:43:27.409
Stop it, Masato!

1:43:27.492 --> 1:43:30.037
You start to understand some things
once you're a parent.

1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:30.996
Masato!

1:43:31.079 --> 1:43:32.080
And then

1:43:32.706 --> 1:43:34.666
you'll be able to realize

1:43:35.500 --> 1:43:38.503
the small joy of simply having a family.

1:43:39.838 --> 1:43:40.923
You hear me?

1:44:04.696 --> 1:44:05.781
All right.

1:44:17.167 --> 1:44:19.503
I'll turn myself in with her.

1:44:26.760 --> 1:44:29.930
I'm going to the bathroom
to wash off the blood.

1:44:30.847 --> 1:44:31.848
Hey!

1:44:39.189 --> 1:44:40.482
I knew it.

1:44:41.275 --> 1:44:43.652
We live in different worlds.

1:44:45.779 --> 1:44:48.282
I should never have picked you up.

1:44:52.244 --> 1:44:53.787
Why did you?

1:44:55.789 --> 1:44:56.873
Pity.

1:44:58.500 --> 1:45:00.460
I thought I was all that you had left…

1:45:02.129 --> 1:45:04.172
since you're a murdering lesbian fool.

1:45:10.262 --> 1:45:11.263
I see.

1:45:14.641 --> 1:45:17.394
I thought you were going to elope with me.

1:45:17.477 --> 1:45:18.729
I was so happy.

1:45:22.983 --> 1:45:24.609
I planned on dying,

1:45:26.987 --> 1:45:28.947
but I'll do what little I can to atone…

1:45:30.866 --> 1:45:32.993
by living and testifying in court.

1:45:36.204 --> 1:45:37.289
And then what?

1:45:39.916 --> 1:45:42.169
I'll live somewhere you'll never go.

1:46:07.319 --> 1:46:09.029
We'll leave in half an hour.

1:46:10.072 --> 1:46:11.406
Stay here.

1:47:10.006 --> 1:47:11.508
Let's pay separately.

1:47:26.022 --> 1:47:27.441
Isn't this…

1:47:28.191 --> 1:47:29.067
You saw it?

1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:34.906
-You kept it all this time?
-It just happened.

1:47:37.159 --> 1:47:39.453
-For ten years?
-That's right.

1:47:43.165 --> 1:47:45.542
Hey, let's go somewhere.

1:47:46.084 --> 1:47:46.960
What?

1:47:48.587 --> 1:47:49.629
Let's run away.

1:47:50.714 --> 1:47:51.715
It's impossible.

1:47:52.340 --> 1:47:54.176
We can't run away forever.

1:47:54.259 --> 1:47:55.719
What are you thinking…

1:48:02.809 --> 1:48:04.811
I was thinking that you're so cute.

1:48:22.287 --> 1:48:23.246
Are you dumb?

1:48:25.665 --> 1:48:26.791
I am.

1:48:28.168 --> 1:48:31.338
I've locked everything up,
so I'll get the car started now.

1:48:31.421 --> 1:48:33.465
-Okay. Be there in a minute.
-Okay.

1:48:46.311 --> 1:48:47.312
Let's go.

1:48:47.938 --> 1:48:48.772
Okay.

1:48:54.778 --> 1:48:56.530
Ready, go!

1:49:00.867 --> 1:49:01.993
-Come on.
-Okay!

1:49:11.962 --> 1:49:13.588
Please do me a favor.

1:49:13.672 --> 1:49:16.049
Don't say anything,
and just give us the car.

1:49:16.716 --> 1:49:17.801
Give up.

1:49:18.677 --> 1:49:21.388
There will be no end to this
if you keep dragging it on.

1:49:21.972 --> 1:49:23.098
Please!

1:49:35.652 --> 1:49:38.196
Why do you think I killed someone?

1:49:44.411 --> 1:49:46.246
I'll never bother you again.

1:49:55.171 --> 1:49:56.131
Are you

1:49:57.507 --> 1:49:58.717
prepared for the worst?

1:50:10.729 --> 1:50:12.856
This is in place of your funeral offering.

1:50:13.982 --> 1:50:14.983
Go, hurry up.

1:50:26.536 --> 1:50:27.871
Hey!

1:50:27.954 --> 1:50:30.332
-I loved you, Masato!
-Hey!

1:50:31.416 --> 1:50:33.043
Let me go!

1:50:36.838 --> 1:50:38.089
Rei!

1:50:47.891 --> 1:50:49.476
Why did you let them go?

1:50:50.810 --> 1:50:52.729
They could end up dead at this rate!

1:50:54.439 --> 1:50:55.690
Rei looked

1:50:56.441 --> 1:51:00.236
-like she was prepared for that.
-Then why did you let her go?

1:51:03.615 --> 1:51:06.326
Being alive doesn't mean
everything will be all right.

1:51:07.410 --> 1:51:08.286
Yes it does.

1:51:09.079 --> 1:51:10.538
They can start from scratch.

1:51:12.207 --> 1:51:13.208
You…

1:51:14.501 --> 1:51:17.504
you don't know why
she killed that man, do you?

1:51:18.213 --> 1:51:19.047
No.

1:51:19.964 --> 1:51:21.633
Me neither.

1:51:23.885 --> 1:51:26.888
Well, thinking about it,

1:51:28.598 --> 1:51:31.726
as long as they both know
what they're doing, so be it.

1:51:33.561 --> 1:51:34.938
What are you talking about?

1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:38.358
You…

1:51:39.275 --> 1:51:42.362
Who would you kill for?

1:51:43.405 --> 1:51:45.198
I would never kill anyone.

1:51:45.281 --> 1:51:48.451
-What if you had no choice?
-Why do you have to talk about this?

1:51:49.577 --> 1:51:51.579
If I could just talk to her…

1:51:53.164 --> 1:51:56.334
She's made up her mind.

1:51:57.168 --> 1:51:58.628
She's considered everything.

1:52:02.716 --> 1:52:03.550
Why?

1:52:07.137 --> 1:52:09.514
Listen up.

1:52:11.141 --> 1:52:14.185
I… could kill someone…

1:52:15.228 --> 1:52:16.813
no matter who tried to stop me,

1:52:17.772 --> 1:52:20.191
if it were for you or the kids.

1:52:25.405 --> 1:52:27.490
Aren't you going to ask me why?

1:53:03.818 --> 1:53:07.322
I thought you were dumb,
but so am I, it turns out.

1:53:08.782 --> 1:53:09.741
Right.

1:53:11.910 --> 1:53:14.621
We're really dumb.

1:53:14.704 --> 1:53:17.081
-Yes!
-You moron!

1:53:17.165 --> 1:53:18.249
Yes!

1:53:43.900 --> 1:53:47.070
Splitting the bill made me feel
equal to you for the first time.

1:53:50.865 --> 1:53:52.200
And that ends today.

1:54:15.306 --> 1:54:16.349
Let's go.

1:54:17.684 --> 1:54:18.935
Where?

1:54:20.645 --> 1:54:22.146
Somewhere we can be alone.

1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:29.404
That gets the heart racing, doesn't it?

1:54:31.614 --> 1:54:35.368
Now this next song was requested…

1:54:35.451 --> 1:54:37.120
This takes me back!

1:54:37.203 --> 1:54:38.580
It's "CHE.R.RY" by YUI!

1:54:45.169 --> 1:54:46.921
Courage

1:54:49.966 --> 1:54:52.093
I'm bad at emoticons

1:54:52.176 --> 1:54:56.472
But my heart starts racing
When I receive one from you

1:54:57.056 --> 1:55:01.477
I shouldn't reply
To your messages immediately

1:55:01.561 --> 1:55:05.815
That's what I heard from someone else

1:55:05.899 --> 1:55:10.820
But I can't play mind games

1:55:10.904 --> 1:55:13.740
Because I like you

1:55:16.075 --> 1:55:20.455
I fell in love

1:55:20.538 --> 1:55:23.333
You probably didn't realize it

1:55:23.416 --> 1:55:29.005
Wishing "CHE.R.RY" upon the starry night

1:55:29.088 --> 1:55:32.842
As I type my message to you

1:55:42.518 --> 1:55:45.021
The cherry blossoms bloom

1:55:45.104 --> 1:55:49.108
As I watch the scenery from my room

1:56:29.857 --> 1:56:31.067
Hey.

1:56:32.694 --> 1:56:34.988
If I had turned myself in,

1:56:35.071 --> 1:56:37.073
you were going to kill
yourself, weren't you?

1:56:40.743 --> 1:56:42.996
I thought I should return you.

1:56:43.538 --> 1:56:45.665
To your family.

1:56:52.964 --> 1:56:54.716
That's why I abandoned them.

1:57:04.058 --> 1:57:06.978
For a dumb, lesbian murderer like me,

1:57:07.895 --> 1:57:09.564
there's no place to go back to.

1:57:13.276 --> 1:57:14.861
You're all I have.

1:58:47.870 --> 1:58:50.957
It must be nice for men.

1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:53.000
They can put something inside women.

1:58:53.668 --> 1:58:55.253
My fingers can't fill you up.

1:59:13.020 --> 1:59:15.022
Just once is fine.

1:59:15.523 --> 1:59:17.650
I want to hold the woman I love in my arms

1:59:17.733 --> 1:59:19.152
and have sex with her.

2:01:09.136 --> 2:01:11.847
Could you kill me?

2:01:26.612 --> 2:01:27.780
Yes.

2:01:37.039 --> 2:01:38.791
But if I killed you,

2:01:40.418 --> 2:01:43.337
what would I do when I'm all alone?

2:02:17.413 --> 2:02:20.833
I couldn't bear you not being in my life!

2:02:24.837 --> 2:02:26.464
It would kill me!

2:02:46.525 --> 2:02:50.237
Now I've killed once,
killing twice would make no difference.

2:02:53.032 --> 2:02:54.700
I can kill you if you want, but…

2:03:46.961 --> 2:03:48.254
No way.

2:04:00.474 --> 2:04:02.017
This is embarrassing.

2:04:06.230 --> 2:04:07.231
Should I stop?

2:04:08.899 --> 2:04:09.942
Don't stop.

2:04:37.011 --> 2:04:38.304
You're the girl I love.

2:05:04.663 --> 2:05:07.833
I'm going to die!

2:06:02.346 --> 2:06:03.556
Listen.

2:06:06.183 --> 2:06:08.519
I don't want to live anymore, anyway.

2:06:09.979 --> 2:06:11.480
I want to end my life myself.

2:06:17.903 --> 2:06:18.862
If…

2:06:20.322 --> 2:06:24.410
if it would kill you to lose me…

2:06:27.955 --> 2:06:29.707
I can kill you.

2:06:45.097 --> 2:06:47.975
Want to say anything before the end?

2:06:56.900 --> 2:06:57.901
I…

2:07:01.697 --> 2:07:06.035
I didn't commit murder so I could
have sex with the person I love.

2:07:13.876 --> 2:07:15.336
I had sex

2:07:16.879 --> 2:07:18.797
with someone I love so much

2:07:20.716 --> 2:07:22.885
that I'd commit murder for them.

2:07:27.556 --> 2:07:29.475
Make sure you don't get that wrong.

2:08:06.011 --> 2:08:07.429
Is this seat empty?

2:08:07.513 --> 2:08:09.682
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

2:08:14.561 --> 2:08:16.313
Everyone's here, right?

2:08:16.397 --> 2:08:18.982
Observation is fundamental
for rough sketching.

2:08:19.066 --> 2:08:20.484
Please begin.

2:08:36.834 --> 2:08:37.751
Your name.

2:08:38.544 --> 2:08:39.378
What?

2:08:40.379 --> 2:08:42.005
What's your name?

2:08:42.089 --> 2:08:43.757
We've never spoken before.

2:08:44.925 --> 2:08:46.051
Tsujimura.

2:08:46.969 --> 2:08:48.220
Nanae Tsujimura.

2:08:52.808 --> 2:08:54.351
I'm Rei Nagasawa.

2:09:14.955 --> 2:09:16.123
Excuse me.

2:09:17.541 --> 2:09:18.500
Yes?

2:09:18.584 --> 2:09:20.627
Did something bad happen to you?

2:09:21.462 --> 2:09:22.838
Why would you say that?

2:09:23.839 --> 2:09:25.466
You seem down.

2:09:27.468 --> 2:09:28.802
Nothing happened.

2:09:28.886 --> 2:09:31.805
Then can you smile?

2:09:33.390 --> 2:09:36.977
I don't like it when
I have to draw someone looking sad.

2:09:38.812 --> 2:09:39.980
Got it.

2:10:24.900 --> 2:10:26.652
-Hey.
-Yes?

2:10:26.735 --> 2:10:29.321
You remember the time we first met?

2:10:29.404 --> 2:10:31.114
It was in art class.

2:10:31.198 --> 2:10:33.450
I do.

2:10:34.868 --> 2:10:37.704
You suddenly asked me to smile,

2:10:37.788 --> 2:10:40.541
and it was creepy.

2:10:46.463 --> 2:10:49.842
I couldn't forget that sour look you had.

2:10:51.969 --> 2:10:55.597
You looked so pitiful
as you forced a smile,

2:10:57.266 --> 2:10:58.642
but also so cute.

2:10:59.768 --> 2:11:02.229
You're the one who told me to smile!

2:11:05.858 --> 2:11:07.609
Why were you in a bad mood?

2:11:16.368 --> 2:11:18.370
My mom left that day.

2:11:20.372 --> 2:11:22.249
It was the day my family fell apart.

2:11:28.797 --> 2:11:31.300
That sketch of me you drew…

2:11:33.385 --> 2:11:36.513
I thought it would be great
if I had a family

2:11:36.597 --> 2:11:38.599
that could make me smile like that.

2:12:39.284 --> 2:12:40.702
Here.

2:12:40.786 --> 2:12:42.037
Get up.

2:12:46.500 --> 2:12:48.001
Here you go.

2:13:07.646 --> 2:13:08.772
Move a little.

2:13:11.984 --> 2:13:13.402
Where are you going?

2:13:14.194 --> 2:13:15.278
To pee.

2:13:45.183 --> 2:13:51.690
Wishing "CHE.R.RY" upon the starry night

2:13:51.773 --> 2:13:56.028
As I type my message to you

2:13:58.572 --> 2:14:05.495
I prefer fruit that ripens slowly

2:14:08.832 --> 2:14:14.296
I want to start our relationship
With small talk

2:14:14.379 --> 2:14:19.968
I shouldn't reply
To your messages immediately

2:14:20.052 --> 2:14:25.307
That's what I heard from someone else

2:14:25.390 --> 2:14:30.854
But I can't play mind games

2:14:30.937 --> 2:14:34.316
Because I like you

2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:40.113
I fell in love

2:14:40.197 --> 2:14:45.410
You probably didn't realize it

2:14:45.494 --> 2:14:52.459
Wishing "CHE.R.RY" upon the starry night

2:14:53.418 --> 2:14:57.089
As I type my message to you

2:15:45.095 --> 2:15:46.346
Hello.

From now on…

2:16:28.722 --> 2:16:30.140
Friends…

2:16:31.641 --> 2:16:32.851
lovers…

2:16:35.312 --> 2:16:37.147
that's all too complicated.

2:16:40.650 --> 2:16:42.527
How about becoming a family instead?

2:16:44.362 --> 2:16:45.405
What?

2:16:50.327 --> 2:16:53.038
Why? What's wrong?

2:16:54.581 --> 2:16:55.498
Nothing.

2:16:57.209 --> 2:16:58.668
I'll go get something to eat.

2:17:09.638 --> 2:17:10.513
Okay.

2:17:45.715 --> 2:17:47.676

2:17:51.721 --> 2:17:52.889

2:18:04.901 --> 2:18:06.152

2:18:20.125 --> 2:18:21.084

2:18:25.630 --> 2:18:27.549
