00:35.369 --> 00:36.704
Aqualad, come in.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.373
-Robin, I'm here.
-Get to the surface, ASAP!

00:39.473 --> 00:42.076
-And bring lots of shrimp.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.377
Just shrimp!

00:43.477 --> 00:45.045
I'll bring an army.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.491
Titans, where's the threat?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.393
Threat?
What are you taking about?

00:59.493 --> 01:00.494
You said you needed me.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.197
Yeah. To bring shrimp, thanks.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.199
CYBORG: Shrimp fry is a go.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.567
Oh, yeah!

01:06.667 --> 01:08.336
Oh, no!

01:11.605 --> 01:12.673
You gotta have some, bro.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.408
These little guys
are so tasty.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.610
That little guy
was my partner.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.715
Sure, he was a loose cannon
but he always
got the job done.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.357
Your partner is delicious!

01:29.457 --> 01:31.192
Mmm.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.195
So, your teammates,
they always eat
other people's friends?

01:34.295 --> 01:35.329
Only when they're hungry.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.231
Otherwise,
they're pretty cool.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.799
Especially Raven.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.735
Mmm. Mmm.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.471
Mmm.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.374
-You mean the little dude
with the hoodie?
-That's no dude, dude!

01:46.707 --> 01:47.541
Hey!

01:47.641 --> 01:49.643
Check it.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.887
She's pretty dark,
which is cool.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.756
But she's also got this
light inside her, you know.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.359
Too bad she's always
playing hard to get.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.760
I'm gonna talk to her.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.796
Would you?
I could totally use
a wing man.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.631
-Hey, there.
What?

02:10.731 --> 02:13.467
Do it wingman,
make me look good.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.504
Your cloak
is absolutely stunning.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.908
It really highlights
those gorgeous eyes.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.576
Please, stop talking.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.212
Yeah, stop talking, dude!

02:24.312 --> 02:26.280
I can tell, you're not
like everybody else.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.216
What you're doing here,
it's not gonna work.

02:28.316 --> 02:31.485
And even if it did,
you couldn't handle this.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.188
I can be pretty intense.

02:34.288 --> 02:38.492
Tonight, you, me and the sea.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.429
Whatever.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.464
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:43.564 --> 02:44.832
What just happened?

02:44.932 --> 02:47.535
Aqualad just asked
Raven out in front of you.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.203
That was cold.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.239
But it's your fault
for trusting a pirate.

02:51.339 --> 02:54.208
Yeah, what, what?
Why would you think
he's a pirate, Cyborg?

02:54.308 --> 02:55.743
Dude, comes from the ocean.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.847
-And he's a pirate!

02:59.947 --> 03:00.881
Tell him, Star!

03:01.715 --> 03:03.384
I do not know
what the pie rat is.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.754
Girl, you are crazy!

03:06.854 --> 03:08.856
A pirate is a swashbucklin',
eye patch wearin',

03:08.956 --> 03:11.259
peg leg havin',
nasty beard,
parrot on the shoulder,

03:11.359 --> 03:14.828
walk the plank, sand,
treasure huntin',
fancy talking buccaneer.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.797
Oh!

03:16.897 --> 03:19.199
And you just saw one
steal Beastie's girl.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.201
Pirate stole my girl!

03:21.302 --> 03:22.803
No!

03:24.872 --> 03:26.206
Mmm. Mmm.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.223
Hey, guys. Where's Raven?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.492
She's probably in...

03:44.592 --> 03:45.859
He has no idea
what you're sayin'.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.729
You have to speak
his language.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.637
Argh!
She be three doors down

03:56.737 --> 03:59.573
on ye starwort side, matey.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.643
So, down the hall?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.946
Aye, matey.

04:06.046 --> 04:10.984
Ooh, only the true pirate
would understand
such strange words.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.602
-We had a date.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.270
I never said yes.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.540
Yet, here you are.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.976
Uh, you're standing
right on that
turtle's eyeball.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.548
He'll be fine.
They're very resilient.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.951
-Seriously, you're always
standing on sea creatures.
-Shh!

04:44.051 --> 04:45.619
You don't need to be nervous.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.321
I'm not nervous.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.423
You just don't know
what you're getting
into with me.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.792
I have a dark side.

04:51.892 --> 04:52.926
I heard.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.295
-Ew! Back it up.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.397
Relax.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.834
Oh, thanks.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.844
RAVEN: So, what did you
want to show me?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.045
This.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.657
So, what?

05:25.092 --> 05:25.859
I'm supposed to fall for you
because you show
me some dancing fish?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.095
Oh, look, they're so adorable!

05:28.195 --> 05:29.930
It's like a musical
is about to break out!

05:30.030 --> 05:32.500
So romantic, I've to kiss
your face. Ugh!

05:32.600 --> 05:33.767
Just wait.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.725
-Oh, that was...

05:57.825 --> 06:00.694
Circle of life, baby.
I thought you'd like it.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.063
I can't believe this.

06:03.163 --> 06:07.100
That for the first time,
I feel like someone gets me.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.703
You should wear
your hood down more often.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.406
Thanks.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.444
Well, I better, uh...

06:17.478 --> 06:18.479
Yeah.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.556
What?

06:28.656 --> 06:30.558
Lay off my girl is what!

06:30.658 --> 06:33.527
Raven wants someone
who can match her intensity.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.529
I can be intense.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.800
Intensity!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.735
I need a nap!

06:41.835 --> 06:43.704
Just...

06:43.804 --> 06:46.106
Just lay off my girl, okay?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.816
I have never seen you
look so adorable, Raven.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.785
Do you have the date?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.419
Just hangin' out with Aqualad.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.688
Quick question.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.023
Has he shown you
his pirate booty yet?

07:04.825 --> 07:05.859
No.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.861
See, he's not a pirate.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.197
That remains to be seen.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.971
What are you doing?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.843
I'm just trying
to be intense, Raven.
For you.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.578
Okay, that's not intense.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.114
In fact Beast Boy,
you are the opposite
of intense.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.586
-Ah!

07:33.587 --> 07:35.689
Hey, Aqualad.
I got something
you might like.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.596
He looks so natural
upon your shoulder.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.866
See! See!

07:47.535 --> 07:49.570
Ye, old pirate detector.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.543
Now, thar be a pirate.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.812
-Anyway, I thought we could
drop by the piranha grounds,

07:58.912 --> 08:00.013
check out all the skeletons?

08:00.113 --> 08:02.182
-That sounds nice.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.717
Raven, don't go!

08:03.817 --> 08:06.219
Step aside you little goblin.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.487
Goblin!

08:09.056 --> 08:10.490
Well, you smell like fish!

08:10.591 --> 08:11.859
Listen, little green face,

08:13.160 --> 08:14.161
you're adorable
and the opposite of who
Raven wants to be with.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.697
I don't understand
why any girl would
ever look at you!

08:16.797 --> 08:18.098
Have you seen me, goblin?

08:18.198 --> 08:20.267
You think you're big?
Well, I can turn
into a dinosaur.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.636
Yes, turn into a dinosaur,
all the girls love dinosaurs.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.904
Stop! Stop!

08:24.004 --> 08:25.906
I don't want you
fighting over me.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.608
I'm sorry, of course not.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.777
Unless it's to the death!

08:29.877 --> 08:31.011
What?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.184
To the death!

08:37.284 --> 08:39.653
I'll check out
those skeletons
with whoever wins.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.221
-Now, fight!

08:41.321 --> 08:42.956
Look, I really like you,

08:43.056 --> 08:45.125
but I am not going
to fight him to the...

09:00.708 --> 09:02.009
You're not gonna fight back?

09:03.644 --> 09:06.814
AQUALAD: Come on!
Why are you eating my eye?

09:06.914 --> 09:08.982
No! Not my hand!

09:09.082 --> 09:10.217
Get him off of me!

09:10.317 --> 09:11.985
All right, all right
enough Beast Boy.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.593
You are dark, woman!

09:22.696 --> 09:23.864
Yeah.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.036
Why did he not use
his pie rat sword?

09:29.136 --> 09:30.771
I was wonderin'
the same thing.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.205
Perhaps I was wrong.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.144
-This is no pirate.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.347
I told you he wasn't a pirate.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.852
We should get him
to a hospital.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.823
So, mama, wanna check out
those skeletons now?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.992
-I said, to the death!
-Uh.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.361
No! I knew I should have
gone for the throat.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.204
Still, that was
pretty intense,
you little goblin.
