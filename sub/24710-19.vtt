the courage to change the things I can,

What'd they do
at Cullinan's arraignment?

Uh, criminal possession.
150,000 dollar bond.

-Judge would only go 150, huh?
-Yeah.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.386
That'll definitely deter flight.

Why would Cullinan want to flee?
If I were him, I'd be dying to go to bat.

What the hell's that supposed to mean?

04:30.228 --> 04:32.063

04:32.480 --> 04:34.065
No record and roots in the community.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.026
Cullinan represents zero flight risk.
I'm lucky I got the 150.

like my school principal,

04:49.664 --> 04:51.374
he's getting punched in his large nose.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.711
If you plan on this lasting more than
five or ten seconds,

04:55.003 --> 04:56.337
you want to do a little attitude check.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.047
My problem is,
I've been looking at the tapes

04:58.131 --> 05:00.758
-from that apartment.
-Why are the tapes a problem?

05:01.092 --> 05:03.177
Well, you telling Cullinan
he's the victim in the operation

05:03.303 --> 05:06.681
after he accuses you of a police vendetta
kind of gives me a problem.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.391
She was being sarcastic.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.102
Good. We'll do voir dire on prospective
jurors' understanding of irony.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.480
Anyone watching that tape
knows Jill was breaking balls.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.857
She's breaking balls.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.900
Just after Sipowicz threatens
to fracture Cullinan's skull.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.279
Come on, Cohen, apprehend a suspect,
you intimidate so as not to use force.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.449
Grateful as I am being edified
by minds of your caliber

05:24.532 --> 05:26.409
about the legal strengths and weaknesses
of my case,

05:27.243 --> 05:29.954
I'm actually here to suggest an area
of investigative focus.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.458
And what would that be,
oh big-syllable-douchebag?

05:34.459 --> 05:36.502
If you want anything more than criminal
possession to stand,

05:36.627 --> 05:38.796
you're gonna have to link the dope
that killed Dolores Mayo

05:39.005 --> 05:40.506
with what Cullinan tried to make her take.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.884
That would be me, Detective Kirkendall.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.804
It's not attempted murder
unless Cullinan knows the dose is lethal.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.641
You only establish that by showing
he had reasonable expectation

05:50.767 --> 05:53.269
based on the first girl dying
that she might die,

05:53.478 --> 05:55.355
which requires predicate knowledge
on Cullinan's part

05:55.938 --> 05:56.981
that the drugs were the same.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.984
You're talking about the purity,
not that it was just heroin.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.903
Yes, in one syllable.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.989
This'll be the first case in history
prosecuted by an eight-year-old.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.658
Castrate an adult,
he tends to sound like a child.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.161
No one castrated you, asshole.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.545
I can't win putting my toxicologist on
against Sinclair's.

You need to find your flopped cop's
heroin source.

-Roberts.
-Roberts being the flopped cop,

06:24.884 --> 06:25.927
now dead. Correct.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.263
Roberts acknowledged providing the smack
Cullinan gave Dolores Mayo.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.307
I need Roberts's source on the stand

06:31.432 --> 06:34.227
saying that smack and what Cullinan
used two nights ago,

06:34.352 --> 06:35.812
came from the same glassine bag.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.690
Alternatively, make the case
it was Cullinan bought Roberts's homicide.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.859
Thanks for the high level of discourse.

06:45.655 --> 06:49.325
-Did he just insult us?
-This overeducated snot-rag.

if I want Cohen off the case?

about something else.

to crucify the squad.

at an A.A. meeting

07:33.494 --> 07:35.913

the Empire State Building than talk to me.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.039
You gotta reach out.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.333
How does Dornan being drunk
get to be my problem?

07:39.417 --> 07:42.670
He's in bad shape. I'm not sure
if he might not be off the job.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.256
And I'm saying why don't you get him help
from someone else in A.A.?

I don't converse with a lot of people
at them meetings.

or you wanna help with one of your own?

07:56.184 --> 07:58.227

are none of my business.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.052

I feel you're ahead of the game

I never told Mr. Mayo anything

10:17.992 --> 10:20.620
I did say Malcolm Cullinan's
arrest for narcotics possession

10:20.745 --> 10:22.455

10:22.538 --> 10:24.165
with trying
to murder Detective Kirkendall,

Mr. Mayo, we don't
give relatives partial information

during an active investigation.
It's painful for them,

10:34.550 --> 10:36.552
and often unnecessary.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.763
Finding out she was killed by this guy,

10:39.305 --> 10:41.265
that's like hearing
she died all over again.

We can't be sure yet
your daughter's death was a murder.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.936

Giving Dolores's father
that information about Cullinan

I don't feel it's necessary to tell you
doing something like this again

-Anyways, see ya, boss.
-Yep. See you tomorrow.

Breezy Point's a good place

with other people's laundry.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.738
And I listened to an asshole pick at her
better than you ever thought about.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.781
Till finally she come back at him,

17:13.365 --> 17:16.785
and he'd have excuse enough
to grab money for his load from her purse.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.123
Wanted drinking money bad enough,
he'd give up even the pride

17:21.206 --> 17:22.958
that would've moved his Black ass
out of the kitchen.

stranger's dirty underwear

17:25.377 --> 17:26.545

17:27.880 --> 17:29.506
So he could pick a fight
and steal her money.

Eye on the ball, Tammy.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.863
-I mean, remind me who he is.
-Mike went out his office window,

18:34.947 --> 18:37.616
smashed his head through a car windshield,
near your work area.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.576
He's who went out his eighth-story window?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.411
Good thing you weren't
trickin' in that car, huh?

18:41.995 --> 18:43.080
Would've ruined the mood.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.249
You saying you didn't
know Roberts personally?

-TAMMY: No.
-ANDY: You're lying.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.962
-Maybe I knew him by face.
-You knew him better than that.

Your pal, Dee Dee,
you took two collars with for pross,

18:54.675 --> 18:57.052
was banging Roberts
silly a couple of years.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.555
-I mean, what's it about?
-DANNY: Just now, Tammy,

18:59.638 --> 19:01.640
it's about you taking
an opportunity to earn

19:02.057 --> 19:04.476
and turning it
into an occasion for pissing us off.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.312
I mean, if I'd run a few errands for him,
that's all I did.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.064
You were running dope for Roberts?

19:09.606 --> 19:11.650
-I wouldn't know what I was picking up.
-Tammy.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.070
I mean, when you say
earning opportunity...

19:15.612 --> 19:17.156
Two hundred for Roberts's source.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.325
Then I gotta get a new place
to cop and everything else.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.828
What about the concept of,
"no wait at a detox"?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.164
Yeah, that should tip the scales.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.542
What I'm worried about, being honest...

19:29.626 --> 19:31.545
is that something's going on.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.964
That's my whole reason
for not being cooperative,

19:34.214 --> 19:36.884
-is that something's going on.
-We think you're right.

19:36.967 --> 19:40.304
Guy's coming up with 7,500
to bail you out on possession.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.599
Something does seem like it's goin' on.
What could it be, Tammy?

19:43.891 --> 19:46.935
I mean, Roberts did not wanna be doing
what he was doing,

19:47.352 --> 19:50.272
and he wound up with his head,
through that car windshield.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.608
I'm afraid of getting caught
in the switches.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.945
I'm you, Tammy, my main worry that regard
is my dealer knowing I can jam him

19:57.029 --> 19:59.907
in a murder investigation
and taking preventative measures.

20:00.073 --> 20:03.702
Yeah, maybe the next somethin' going on
is you keeling over from a hot shot.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.370
DANNY: I worked narcotics.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.623
I can show you some other
good corners to score.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.833
I know some.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.211
I'm just no good with change.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.510
You're not gonna believe,
the guy I'm about to give you is a dealer.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.490
She give us a dealer to look at,
that whore.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.492
Runs a Wall Street messenger service.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.078
She knew we'd be shocked, Tammy,
a guy like that moving smack.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.705
-You got a place to look?
-Yeah. She give us where to look.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.707
How thorough do you want
Tammy to make her list?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.084
Other girls she saw Roberts with?

20:52.167 --> 20:55.295
If you think, when you go back in there,
she's gonna have anything on that pad

20:55.379 --> 20:58.215
but her head asleep,
you better learn to curb your optimism.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.175
So I'll get, like, three names
and cut her loose.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.594

a grade promotion.

I got some special in

21:21.154 --> 21:22.197
to do anything for Dornan?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.116
Yeah. Okay.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.868
Does both of you being alcoholics
give you some special in?

21:27.244 --> 21:29.705

I wouldn't be asking a favor.

-Neither does our both being Black.
-I got the picture. No problem.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.626

falling off the wagon.

My old man did not lose
his eye unprovoked. All right?

21:51.935 --> 21:54.938
I didn't know he lost his eye.
What's that got to do with Dornan?

21:56.523 --> 21:59.860
I remembered in a dream
how he really lost his eye, my Pop.

22:00.485 --> 22:04.531
And it wasn't one of you drunk
attacking him on his meter route.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.744

by his boss already.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.579

22:12.205 --> 22:13.206
That dream come to me,

22:13.290 --> 22:16.251

doin' a favor for Sylvia

22:16.376 --> 22:17.961
and showing me you couldn't generalize.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.922
And for reaching out,
he winds up flopped, Dornan,

22:21.089 --> 22:22.215

owing a Black man a solid.

why the booze isn't workin',

and lying in his own puke.

Plants drugs in your gym bag,
some son of a bitch.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.008
-Oh, my God.
-What is it?

27:16.426 --> 27:17.761
All right. All right.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.264
The bike? It has something
to do with the green bike.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.016
Maybe it'll come to him as we drive.

27:23.183 --> 27:26.019
I get it. I see what's going on.
It's a former operator.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.313
That bike right there is involved in this.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.732
Do you need to spill now,
or can you hold the thought?

27:31.691 --> 27:32.901
I'm good. I can hold it.

27:34.944 --> 27:37.447
Good. Here we go. Slide over.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.501
No second chances.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.961
Messenger behaves inappropriately,
he's gone.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.881
-That's hard and fast with you?
-He's gone. Doesn't work for me anymore.

27:55.674 --> 27:59.052
So it's your feeling some disgruntled
former employee jacked you up.

27:59.594 --> 28:00.845
-Kenny.
-Kenny.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.514
I can give you the guy's name.

28:03.139 --> 28:05.225
-N'tundi.
-N'tundi?

28:05.809 --> 28:06.893
Last name?

28:07.811 --> 28:09.437
-That is his last name.
-First name.

28:09.646 --> 28:12.607
-Obed.
-Obed N'tundi.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.192
ANDY: What is that, Swiss?

28:15.443 --> 28:17.362
He's a Nigerian I fired
for smoking heroin.

28:17.445 --> 28:18.530
I don't know where he is now.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.532
And he swore vengeance, Obed?

28:20.615 --> 28:22.742
Plants a half a key
of smack in your gym bag.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.245
Depending on purity,
and given Obed's extraction,

28:25.412 --> 28:27.163
I'm betting it could be very pure

28:27.455 --> 28:29.249
that could be worth upwards
of a hundred grand.

28:30.291 --> 28:31.543
Well, I don't know what it's worth.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.461
So that must have been
some resentment Obed harbored,

28:33.712 --> 28:35.004
blowin' that kind of dough.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.549
The two of you have harsh words?
Did that up the ante?

28:37.924 --> 28:42.137
Did he feel you gave him faulty directions
to a delivery destination?

28:43.596 --> 28:46.850
You guys want me, right?
No matter what the truth is.

28:47.016 --> 28:49.644
Yeah. If a guy like that existed,
we wouldn't want to collar up,

28:49.978 --> 28:53.189
maybe flip him into giving us
some international import group.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.818
Yeah. Then you're looking at promotion,
every other damn thing.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.778
Well, I'm telling you,
he planted that heroin.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.948
Obed's where now, Kenny?
Guessing Manitoba?

29:02.657 --> 29:04.868
-Hey, screw this.
-Mike Roberts.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.870
The whole story, and you walk.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.789
Track down Obed
and confront him with his betrayal.

(CLEARS THROAT)

29:12.459 --> 29:13.835

29:14.419 --> 29:16.713

for my delivery service

29:16.880 --> 29:17.964

29:19.424 --> 29:20.467
I mean, that's, uh...

29:22.051 --> 29:23.052
That's all I know.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.138
DANNY: Kenny, you're a guppy.

29:25.805 --> 29:28.558
You realize the luck of that?
You're a guppy.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.226

Embrace your guppyness.

-DANNY: Who have you got, Kenny?

29:40.820 --> 29:42.655
Everyone Roberts ran with.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.202
The truth is, he was the guppy.

29:47.952 --> 29:51.873
He worked security. He had a client,
who was a very powerful freak.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.917
-Junkie?
-Freak.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.544
-For junkies.
-DANNY: Any type?

29:57.337 --> 30:00.423
-Junkie hookers.
-Dead junkie hookers, Kenny?

30:04.928 --> 30:06.805
So you guys knew where the cab was goin'
all the time.

Until you testify, you two lucky ducks

together in a motel.

-Epsom salts and coffee grounds?
-I think probably either/or, and...

-Hi, Andy.
-Hi.

He gardens also.
We were sharing our secrets.

-DANNY: How do you do?

Anyways, come on. We can talk in here.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.850
Andy, motel money from the D.A.'s office?

30:52.308 --> 30:54.686
Save us a ball-breaking.
get it from the Chief of Detectives.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.188
Lieutenant Fancy's upstairs in robbery.
Then he's leaving for the day.

30:57.814 --> 30:58.982
Thanks, John.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.870
I heard something in your voice,
Andy, when you called.

31:11.953 --> 31:12.996
I guess what you heard

31:13.121 --> 31:14.622
didn't include the words
coming out of my mouth.

31:14.706 --> 31:18.293
I heard something, and I checked
my intuition afterwards by prayer.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.961
Katie, this has gotta stop.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.798
After God tells you what to do,

31:24.007 --> 31:26.551
if I'm involved in the message,
you check back with me.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.095
So many people,
when they're seeking counsel,

31:29.178 --> 31:32.348
-say it's not for themselves.
-I brought you to that program.

31:32.932 --> 31:36.019
-Where do you get off working on me?
-I'm not working on you.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.314
By your own account,
you don't participate very much,

31:39.522 --> 31:42.901
and I thought maybe you were reaching out
to be helped in this area.

31:43.026 --> 31:45.361
Katie, that someone else
that's a real person

31:45.612 --> 31:47.989
that I was really looking
for someone to talk to him.

31:49.198 --> 31:51.534
-That man from the meeting?
-The Black cop, Dornan.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.245
If you weren't so busy
flappin' your angel's wings,

31:54.412 --> 31:58.374
you'd have realized that he's the subject
instead of runnin' to bother me.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.713
I don't mean "bothering" me.

32:06.549 --> 32:09.260
-(SIGHS)
-I don't think I'm an angel.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.806

32:15.475 --> 32:16.517
Katie, I'm glad.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.566
I brought a phone list from the meeting.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.070
Thinking that I wanted people
to call myself.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.529
I've learned so many times

32:28.655 --> 32:32.283
what we think and what God
intends through us is so different.

32:34.327 --> 32:38.081
-He made sure I got this for your friend.
-He's not my friend.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.541
Even though I misunderstood.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.259
-Do you want me to take you tonight?
-It's okay, Andy.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.845
Only if you'll be going yourself.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.073
-Boss?
-What is it?

33:13.491 --> 33:16.828
Um, I was... I was, uh, looking for you
in the robbery squad.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.663
What do you need?

33:20.373 --> 33:21.958
Andy and me were wondering
whether or not

33:22.083 --> 33:24.127
you'd reach out
to the Chief of Ds for motel money.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.838
-You turn that dealer?
-On his ass, boss.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.298
Puts his dope in Cullinan's pocket.

33:37.598 --> 33:40.643
Andy and I were talking about somebody
with a drinking problem.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.815
And it reminded me
of somebody in my family.

33:46.149 --> 33:49.360
(PANTS) And that's why I'm in here.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.988
No rush calling the Chief of Detectives.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.491
I couldn't help him.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.204
He died on the street and so forth.

34:02.248 --> 34:05.001
-Yeah, huh?
-(SOBS) He died.

34:06.377 --> 34:09.213
You know, he died helpless.

34:11.841 --> 34:12.925

34:14.469 --> 34:16.095
You can't help somebody like that.

-It don't make the pain less.
-ARTHUR: No.

34:23.436 --> 34:24.604

you have to learn from life.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.619

he has a friend who gets tickets.

if I could come, too.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.993
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.538
I heard those very words
come from this mouth.

35:23.788 --> 35:28.626
-And, um, what words came from his?
-Oh, he said, uh, "sure."

35:28.793 --> 35:31.045
-Something like that.
-So good.

Huh. Did you tell him to stay hostile
and keep belittling my job performance?

35:58.781 --> 36:01.409
Yeah. I told him that was the shortcut
to your heart.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.459
So here's your opportunity showing me.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.005
Would you excuse us?

go belligerent on her again,
