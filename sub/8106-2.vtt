00:01.251 --> 00:02.752
Mom!

00:06.507 --> 00:07.840
I'm thirsty.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.676
I just gave you water.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.052
I want juice.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.470
It's bedtime.

00:12.596 --> 00:15.056
Close your eyes
and go to sleep.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.036
Mom!

00:39.164 --> 00:40.081
What do you want, Clance?

00:40.207 --> 00:42.333
Oh. Hi, Dad.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.960
Go to bed.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.586
Can I turn the TV on?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.922
TV's only for the daytime.
That was the deal.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.883
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.343
Go to bed.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.886
Dad, what if...

00:55.973 --> 00:57.974
What if they come
to get me again?

00:59.893 --> 01:04.105
Nobody is coming to get you,
okay? Go to bed now.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.741
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.

02:38.867 --> 02:39.909
If you plan to
be out at the shore today,

02:40.035 --> 02:41.702
you are in for a treat.

02:41.829 --> 02:46.415
We're looking at mostly sunny skies up
and down the Jersey coast...

02:46.875 --> 02:48.251
I guess he's already up.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.044
That's a first.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.840
Well, I'll see
if he needs breakfast.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.594
Hey, Clance, you hungry?

03:02.599 --> 03:04.976
Hon, he's not down here.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.894
You sure?

03:07.646 --> 03:19.949
Clancy?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.538
Clancy? Where are you?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.084
- Sweetie, are you hiding?
- Clancy?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.919
Where is he?

03:32.462 --> 03:35.798
Clancy!

03:37.467 --> 03:39.719
You're gonna be in big trouble
when I find you.

03:39.845 --> 03:44.098
Honey, come out right now,
wherever you are. This is not funny.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.560
Clance?

03:47.686 --> 03:48.936
Clancy?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.433
Where's the sweat and the BO?

05:50.559 --> 05:53.269
You've taken such pride
in bathing us all in your musk.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.228
I showered at home.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.897
And yet you're
earlier than usual.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.983
Is this an intervention?

05:59.109 --> 06:01.027
It's a little late,
since I'm not using drugs anymore.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.237
I am, however,
still hooked on phonics.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.322
If you did your morning run
and showered at home,

06:05.449 --> 06:06.615
you'd be later than usual.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.367
Thought of you in the shower.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.620
How's your leg?
You seem to be favoring your left side.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.539
I was hanging down
my right pant leg yesterday,

06:13.665 --> 06:14.957
makes all the difference
in the world.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.584
You've taken the stairs
every day.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.044
Do I need a restraining order?

06:18.170 --> 06:20.004
You slack on your rehab,

06:20.130 --> 06:23.507
the muscle will weaken,
and your leg will hurt again.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.262
Looks like the ketamine
treatment might not stick.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.557
Or maybe we've made him depressed
because we're lying to him,

06:31.683 --> 06:33.017
telling him
he got that case wrong.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.311
We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...

06:35.437 --> 06:37.229
He gets depressed,
he stops exercising.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.398
He stops exercising,
the muscle atrophies.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.317
The muscle atrophies,
the pain returns.

06:41.443 --> 06:45.488
Maybe he stopped exercising because the
giant hole in his leg actually hurts.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.823
The ketamine
could work perfectly,

06:47.949 --> 06:51.243
and he would still be back on his cane,
popping Vicodin again.

06:51.369 --> 06:55.498
You can't tell him.
He got lucky. There was no medical...

06:55.624 --> 06:57.041
He was right.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.252
We tell him he was right,
and we're feeding his addiction.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.546
Without Vicodin,
he's only got one to focus on.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.590
Well, he's not gonna
OD on puzzles.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.009
No, it's not gonna hurt him,

07:07.177 --> 07:10.679
but he could just as easily
have killed that patient.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.559
We have a tiny window of time here where
House may be healthy enough to change,

07:15.685 --> 07:18.979
and based on that limp,
the window's closing fast.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.946
Kid is a product
of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy,

07:27.072 --> 07:30.449
had all his vaccinations,
fractured his right ulna at age three,

07:30.575 --> 07:32.076
chicken pox at age five...

07:32.202 --> 07:34.078
He ever get his feelings hurt?

07:35.914 --> 07:37.832
I'll need to know that, too.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.085
You are "0" for one since you came back.
We just wanna make sure that...

07:41.211 --> 07:43.254
Rectal bleeding plus
alien-abduction fantasies.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.713
Most likely sexual abuse.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.133
Penetration causes the bleed.
Trauma causes the fantasy.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.719
ER ran a rape kit, found no evidence
of tearing, semen or pubic hairs.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.013
I think we should
talk to the kid.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.058
Why? In case
he's telling the truth?

07:57.769 --> 07:58.936
You're a believer, aren't you?

07:59.062 --> 08:01.188
Well, I'm just not
arrogant enough to think

08:01.314 --> 08:05.359
that of the 50 billion galaxies,
100 billion stars per galaxy

08:05.485 --> 08:07.361
and 10 million billion planets
in the universe,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.155
that we're the only ones
with life.

08:09.281 --> 08:12.283
No, but I'm guessing we're the only ones
who like shoving things

08:12.409 --> 08:13.325
through our back doors.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.161
There is new research indicating a link

08:15.287 --> 08:16.996
between neurological problems
and bleeding disorders.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.915
Perfect, especially
if there were neurological problems.

08:20.083 --> 08:24.044
What part of hallucinating
an alien abduction isn't neurological?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.588
It wasn't a hallucination.

08:25.714 --> 08:28.048
What? You think the kid...

08:28.175 --> 08:30.009
He's having nightmares.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.762
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything
other than wanting to sleep with Mommy,

08:33.889 --> 08:36.348
which just leaves us
with one symptom, the bloody tuchus,

08:36.474 --> 08:39.685
which can easily explained
by a GI problem or bleeding disorder.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.898
Check his coags with a PT,
PTT and bleeding time,

08:44.024 --> 08:46.734
and prep him for endoscopies
from above and below.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.284
I'm gonna make
a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?

08:56.620 --> 08:58.954
Then I'm gonna time how long
it takes for you to stop bleeding.

08:59.748 --> 09:03.792
Now, this is gonna sting a little,
so you might wanna look the other way.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.635
Are those windows locked?

09:12.761 --> 09:15.846
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.182
Good, 'cause they know
I'm here.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.352
Clancy, don't bother
the doctor with this stuff.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.771
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?

09:23.897 --> 09:27.399
They put a chip in my neck
so they can keep track of me.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.984
I can feel it back there.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.695
Clancy, you know
there is nothing back there.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.780
There is.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.115
Let me see. Lean forwards.

09:35.825 --> 09:40.120
And they have this other thing, and they
put it in between these two ribs,

09:40.247 --> 09:44.750
always on this side,
and then they move it around my insides.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.001
It hurts.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.170
You know what, Clancy?

09:48.296 --> 09:50.297
I think I might have
found the chip back there,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.091
and I think I might be able
to get it out.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.968
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:56.054 --> 09:59.181
Okay, lean forwards.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.560
Now hold very still, okay?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.230
Got it.

10:09.276 --> 10:13.487
I'm seven, not three.
All you did was pinch my neck.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.159
Sorry.

10:19.661 --> 10:23.414
His alien-abduction story,
the level of detail is...

10:23.540 --> 10:25.332
Well, I don't know
where he gets it from.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.626
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi.
He doesn't read comic books...

10:27.752 --> 10:30.296
Great. You do any
of that medical stuff we talked about?

10:30.422 --> 10:32.256
Upper and lower endoscopies
were clean.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.258
So it's a simple
bleeding disorder.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.011
No, blood tests are all normal,
and he clotted in six minutes.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.848
So it's a simple bleeding disorder,
and you screwed up the test.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.891
I didn't screw up the test.

10:43.018 --> 10:47.521
So it's a UFO.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.650
Either you screwed up the test, or
I screwed up my analysis of this case.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.403
If you screwed up,
I don't have to cry myself to sleep.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.364
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.076
How could I screw up
a simple bleeding-time test?

11:01.202 --> 11:04.163
Maybe you were abducted,
lost time.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.298
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.

11:14.841 --> 11:15.674
Sure?

11:15.800 --> 11:19.303
I had to stop the bleeding
myself after 25 minutes.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.307
So you're saying
Chase did screw up.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.061
Or Foreman screwed up.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.563
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.025
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playing the dozens.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.319
You're at a huge cultural
disadvantage here, Chase.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.321
Take a couple of minutes
to think of a witty retort.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.198
So we have contradicting
bleeding-time tests.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.158
If we run labs
to check his clotting factors,

11:41.284 --> 11:42.618
we can confirm which one's right.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.994
Yeah, testing. Nice idea.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.705
Way better than trying
to guess which doctor's incompetent.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.749
Looks better
in the paperwork, too.

11:48.875 --> 11:52.795
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat,
when her beeper goes off,

11:52.921 --> 11:54.338
people think she's backing up.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.976
Where's Clancy?

12:08.103 --> 12:10.562
He's asleep. He's...

12:14.192 --> 12:17.361
House, Clancy's gone missing.

12:18.321 --> 12:23.450
Oh, no! You take Alpha Centauri,
Foreman can look on Tatooine,

12:23.576 --> 12:26.912
and Cameron can set up
an intergalactic checkpoint.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.208
Let's pray he hasn't gone
into hyperdrive. We'll never catch him.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.633
Clancy?

12:39.801 --> 12:43.512
I had to go where there are no windows
so I could get the chip out.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.972
God.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.641
I can feel it.
I just can't grab it.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.060
Clancy, stop.
There is no chip.

12:52.689 --> 12:56.817
We're gonna clean you up,
and we're gonna go back to your room.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.446
You can't do things like this.
Your parents...

13:19.632 --> 13:25.053
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify the metal.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.764
Said it might not
even be terrestrial.

13:27.891 --> 13:28.724
Really?

13:28.850 --> 13:33.228
No, you idiot, it's titanium,
like from a surgical pin,

13:33.354 --> 13:36.607
like the kind the kid had inserted
into his broken arm four years ago.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.816
Nice medical history.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.359
That pin was removed
six months...

13:39.486 --> 13:42.112
So a little piece broke off
during removal.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.782
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.659
Tell that to the guys
on the Kursk.

13:47.785 --> 13:51.038
And how exactly did it get from his arm
to the back of his neck?

13:51.164 --> 13:52.915
Body attacks
any foreign object.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.793
Inflammatory reaction could erode it
into a vein. Fragment gets a free ride.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.338
To his lungs maybe,
not his neck.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.341
Yeah, an alien chip
makes more sense.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.428
The real mystery is
that you didn't actually screw up.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.805
You okay?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.016
Fine. Tripped.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.852
Kid carved a hole
in the back of his neck.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.855
Apparently didn't bleed
to death. Now that's weird.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.565
He clotted on his own?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.067
Sure did.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.904
So first there was no bleeding disorder.
Then there was. Now there's not again.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.239
Which is impossible.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.658
Or Foreman screwed up.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.077
Two out of three tests
agree with my findings.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.038
Lucky for us,
the fourth test will be the charm.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.545
So you're just gonna
keep cutting him? Until what?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.214
This test is different.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.926
We'll draw some blood, and see if
any clotting factors are low or missing.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.845
- But why haven't the other tests...
- We've got three results.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.139
They haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.016
Or two of them.

14:53.434 --> 14:58.272
Is it possible the problem isn't
his blood? It's just psychological?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.441
I mean,
he almost killed himself.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.527
He wasn't trying
to hurt himself.

15:03.653 --> 15:07.906
No, he was just looking
for an alien tracking device.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.578
I have time for one more.

15:12.704 --> 15:15.414
Can't blame you
for spending extra time down here.

15:15.540 --> 15:19.001
I heard the Artist
Formerly Known as Gimp is back upstairs.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.711
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.796
She's busy. I'll take it.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.844
Oh, my God! You're...

15:30.013 --> 15:32.347
You're okay!

15:32.473 --> 15:33.807
Have we met?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.642
I was one of your doctors.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.936
You were in a vegetative state
when you left here last week.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.980
Addison's disease.

15:40.106 --> 15:45.235
All I needed was cortisol,
and my brain turned on like a switch.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.862
This is amazing!

15:46.988 --> 15:49.072
Surprised you didn't know.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.407
How would I know?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.826
Not quite my old self yet.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.870
Baby steps,
the doctors tell me. Now...

15:54.996 --> 15:58.332
With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.627
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife,

16:02.128 --> 16:05.339
and I was hoping that
maybe you could...

16:05.465 --> 16:07.966
Viagra?
You're here for Viagra?

16:08.092 --> 16:10.677
A bucketful would be nice.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.932
Dr. Cuddy.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.060
Hi.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.067
It's completely unethical.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.234
He was reckless
with a patient.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.278
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.280
He needs at least
some glimmer of humility.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.615
Why does he need that?

16:31.741 --> 16:35.619
Because other people have that? Why does
he need to be like other people?

16:35.745 --> 16:37.412
He needs to be less reckless.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.914
Well, you did it.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.043
He's dismissing symptoms, looking
for easy solutions. He's in pain.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.128
- How much pain?
- Why?

16:47.674 --> 16:50.258
You know this is
affecting him, don't you?

16:52.470 --> 16:55.305
Telling him that he got his last case
right won't do anything to help him.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.808
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.851
But you don't know.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.229
Just let me run a PET scan

17:02.355 --> 17:05.315
on his parietal thalamic area
to see if it's sensing pain.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.609
If it is, the ketamine
isn't working anymore,

17:07.735 --> 17:09.361
and he's headed for a huge crash.

17:09.487 --> 17:14.616
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault,
and I will tell him the truth.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.708
Too tight?

17:23.501 --> 17:25.168
My parents think I'm crazy.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.670
No, they don't.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.255
They're just worried
about you. That's all.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.048
I'm not weird.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.884
It's just that weird things
keep happening to me.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.344
Slight pinch.

17:37.140 --> 17:41.143
If you make me better, do you think
the aliens will leave me alone?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.770
I don't think they're gonna be
bothering you for much longer.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.147
Are you lying again?

17:45.273 --> 17:46.356
No.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.235
We figure this out,
everything's gonna be okay.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.288
Still with us?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.252
Let's go.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.924
Pulmonary edema,
stage-two hypertensive crisis.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.760
What is happening?
Wait outside.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.846
Get him oxygen, and start him
on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.264
Get them outside!

18:19.932 --> 18:23.059
He's in ICU, systolic is
hovering around 170.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.811
I left instructions to lower it slowly

18:24.937 --> 18:26.855
so we don't risk
hypoperfusing his organs.

18:26.981 --> 18:29.900
Trade-off being that leaving his
blood pressure that high risks stroke,

18:30.026 --> 18:31.359
MI and blindness.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.069
I'm open to suggestions.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.864
Solve the case. Kidneys could explain...

18:35.990 --> 18:37.407
Kidneys are clean.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.619
Tell me
he's a mutant-human hybrid.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.162
It is a bleeding disorder.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.373
Clancy tested positive
for Von Willebrand's.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.417
I didn't screw up.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.129
How could he clot on his own
two out of three times?

18:53.925 --> 18:55.008
Maybe he cheated.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.011
Right. Kids always cheat
on their bleeding-time tests.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.723
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.976
I have no idea what you meant, but
I could smell what The Rock was cooking.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.688
I meant, he's clotting right now,
and he's in hypertensive crisis.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.232
Maybe the two are related.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.776
What if he was hypertensive
the other two times that he clotted?

19:12.902 --> 19:15.946
Hypertensive crisis
can activate clotting factors.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.241
Even someone low on Von Willebrand's
could theoretically clot.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.785
And the first time Clancy clotted,
he was all worked up

19:21.911 --> 19:24.830
recounting his alien abduction.
He could've easily been hypertensive.

19:24.956 --> 19:28.208
I get worked up when I cut microchip
tracking implants out of my neck.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.584
Sounds like a cheat to me.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.586
Yeah, we get it.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.922
Okay, what's the differential
for a seven-year-old boy

19:34.048 --> 19:37.133
suffering multiple
hypertensive crises?

19:39.554 --> 19:42.389
We think the problem is
in your son's heart.

19:42.557 --> 19:46.309
We need to do a procedure
called a transesophageal echo.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.728
Okay, and that will
fix his heart?

19:48.855 --> 19:53.024
That will tell us where the problem
is, hopefully. Then we can fix him.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.579
Listen, this isn't
really part of my job,

20:05.705 --> 20:09.583
but he's worried that
you think he's crazy.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.918
Well, isn't he?

20:12.628 --> 20:15.839
There are still plenty of other
explanations for what's going on.

20:16.757 --> 20:22.095
It's important he knows
you believe in him, even if you don't.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.728
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.

20:30.605 --> 20:34.316
Why don't I have a high-def
in my office? I'm a department head.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.068
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.

20:37.194 --> 20:42.073
Tissue characterization is impossible
when the pixels are the size of Legos.

20:43.701 --> 20:46.161
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.330
Foreman, you gotta
steal this thing for me.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.873
Let me ring up
one of the homies.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.833
The clearer the image, the clearer it is

20:51.959 --> 20:54.044
that there are no masses,
no clots, no tears.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.296
The problem's gotta be
somewhere else.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.050
We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.017
You're wrong, House.

21:09.143 --> 21:12.312
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX
before he admits it?

21:12.438 --> 21:13.688
- There.
- Where?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.650
Right there.
Left side, no movement.

21:18.361 --> 21:21.196
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.

21:21.322 --> 21:24.074
How do you see something not move
if nothing's moving?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.909
I need a laser pointer.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.286
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?

21:28.412 --> 21:31.915
Who's gonna take us seriously
if we don't have a laser pointer?

21:32.083 --> 21:34.834
Right here.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.880
A few thousand myocytes
not beating with the rest.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.091
So you've found an arrhythmia?

21:41.217 --> 21:43.760
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.429
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.

21:46.555 --> 21:50.600
Go get me those myocytes.
I wanna talk to them in my office.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.022
How's the kid doing?

21:57.024 --> 22:00.193
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.029
Most of it, anyway.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.700
Why do they bother
putting age restrictions on these things

22:06.826 --> 22:09.661
when all you have to do
is click, "Yes, I am 18?"

22:09.787 --> 22:11.955
Even a 17-year-old
can figure that out.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.040
What's going on with the leg?

22:15.543 --> 22:17.627
First, tell me
what's going on with the boobs.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.422
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.590
It's called an underwire.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.467
I wanna get a PET scan
of your brain.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.885
I think it's hormones.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.263
As long as there's
no increased activity in the thalamus...

22:28.389 --> 22:31.224
Looks to me like those puppies
are going into the dairy business.

22:31.350 --> 22:36.104
...then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.149
After you workout, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.610
Guess I should be saying, "Mazel tov."
Who gets to pass out the cigars?

22:42.737 --> 22:46.031
I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.116
- Boy or girl? You got a name?
- I'm not pregnant.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.951
- My leg doesn't hurt.
- You're in denial.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.619
No, I'm not!

22:51.871 --> 22:53.371
Oh, you got me.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.131
If I thought that my leg
was deteriorating,

23:03.257 --> 23:06.384
don't you think
I'd want to take steps to prevent that?

23:08.637 --> 23:09.637
Okay.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.726
Gotta go.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.156
Here's Clancy's DNA.

23:29.533 --> 23:33.953
And here's the DNA from that piece
of his heart we just biopsied.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.794
That is impossible.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.588
Run it again.

23:43.714 --> 23:47.050
We already did
and once more after that.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.761
The genes from Clancy's
myocytes don't match the genes

23:49.887 --> 23:52.222
from the rest of his body.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.475
Alien DNA.

24:02.858 --> 24:07.070
Anybody watch any X-Files
that inspired an explanation?

24:07.238 --> 24:11.199
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.

24:11.325 --> 24:14.577
That much sun, he'd be dying with
a healthy bronze glow.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.955
Nitrous acid
or ethidium-bromide exposure.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.040
First, Daddy was a rapist.
Now he's a chemist.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.543
Various species of fungus
have been proven mutagenic.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.837
Not unless the kid's
been eating barrels of celery

24:23.963 --> 24:26.131
or living in Indonesia or both.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.966
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?

24:28.092 --> 24:29.050
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.761
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.

24:32.721 --> 24:36.391
Please, someone, give me a plausible,
terrestrial explanation

24:36.517 --> 24:38.101
for this kid's alien DNA.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.521
We could search his home for toxins,
fungals and radiation.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.524
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with strep,

24:44.650 --> 24:48.111
we don't conduct a search to see which
classmate he got it from. We cure it.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.947
We know he's got the stuff inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.949
Where do we cut?
Chances are, it's not just in his heart.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.243
Well, we got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.162
We could see that
these weren't working.

24:57.288 --> 25:00.623
I don't know how the hell
we're gonna find it anywhere else.

25:03.085 --> 25:07.005
What if we take the heart cells
with the bad DNA, and we tag them?

25:08.132 --> 25:10.592
Can you phrase that
in the form of a metaphor?

25:10.718 --> 25:12.635
It's the same way
we search for cancer.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.972
The bad DNA creates a unique protein
on the surface of the affected cells.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.683
We create an antibody
that recognizes only that protein,

25:18.809 --> 25:21.728
we flush it throughout his system,
and the similar cells light up

25:21.854 --> 25:24.189
like light bulbs.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.568
Okay, let's do that.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.496
You have to tell him.

25:40.623 --> 25:41.956
He said he wasn't in any pain.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.125
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.585
We need another plan.

25:45.711 --> 25:46.961
Don't talk about it that way.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.213
What way?

25:48.714 --> 25:49.714
"Plan."

25:49.840 --> 25:51.466
It sounds like we're conspiring
against him.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.426
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.638
Then come up with a cunning plan
and fast.

26:00.684 --> 26:04.646
She's not nearly as delightful
as she thinks she is.

26:05.356 --> 26:07.440
What's this machine do?

26:08.275 --> 26:10.068
Makes a lot of noise,

26:10.611 --> 26:12.528
and it's gonna help us figure out
what's wrong with you.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.114
You think House
has lost a step?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.533
He's fine.

26:18.869 --> 26:22.622
There. Clump of affected cells
in the bone marrow of the femur.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.207
Explains the
intermittent-bleeding disorder.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.961
'Cause I don't need to subject myself
to House's torture if there's no upside.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.004
I'm telling you, he's fine.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.842
We missed some
affected cells in his heart.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.303
Explains the continuing
hypertensive issues.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.181
You said the last case
really threw him, and now suddenly...

26:40.307 --> 26:41.641
I was wrong.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.769
So you changed your mind. Why?

26:45.938 --> 26:49.190
His brilliant ideas
on this case have all been yours.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.277
There's the reason for him
needing glasses.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.238
Apparently, it's a symptom.
It means the condition predates...

26:55.364 --> 26:59.450
You don't change your mind
without a reason. Now, what do you know?

27:01.996 --> 27:06.291
House didn't blow
the last case.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.461
Cuddy cured the guy
using House's idea.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.798
Cuddy and Wilson
are trying to teach him some humility.

27:17.219 --> 27:20.680
Scan is complete. Three hot spots,
but nothing in his brain.

27:20.806 --> 27:25.226
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.895
Is he going to be
able to walk?

27:28.022 --> 27:30.940
His leg should be
functional after some rehab.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.943
"Functional"?
What does that mean?

27:34.069 --> 27:37.113
He'll be able to walk,
but not run? He'll have a limp?

27:37.239 --> 27:39.824
If everything goes well,
he'll walk. He'll run.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.368
He'll probably be
even stronger than he is now.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.956
When we close him up,
we'll move over to his other leg,

27:47.082 --> 27:50.543
snake a catheter up through
the femoral artery and into his heart.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.296
Once the affected areas are removed,

27:53.422 --> 27:56.132
is normal tissue
ill step back in, do its job.

27:56.258 --> 27:59.052
He should have no more problems
with his blood pressure.

27:59.178 --> 28:03.264
After confirming those areas are clear,
we'll start the final procedure.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.350
We're gonna insert
a needle through the pupil

28:05.476 --> 28:07.727
and get rid of the
abnormal cells in the retina.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.865
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?

28:21.325 --> 28:22.950
Yeah, it's clear.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.953
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.415
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.709
Thank you.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.432
Do you wanna go for a run?

28:47.184 --> 28:48.476
What do you want?

28:48.602 --> 28:49.977
I want you to run.

28:55.818 --> 28:58.069
When did you become an enabler?

28:58.195 --> 29:00.154
I'm enabling you to exercise.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.615
Vicodin blocks the pain,
you get through your rehab,

29:02.741 --> 29:04.700
muscle strength increases,
and pain decreases.

29:04.827 --> 29:08.996
I'd rather not become dependent
on pain pills to get through my day.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.584
You're just like
any other patient,

29:13.710 --> 29:16.921
running away from knowledge
that won't make you happy.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.756
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.467
You're scared
the ketamine treatment's wearing off,

29:21.593 --> 29:25.054
that it was just
a torturous window to the good life.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.432
What part of "poop"
didn't you understand?

29:27.558 --> 29:30.393
How can you be so sure
it isn't just a sore muscle?

29:30.519 --> 29:33.521
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.

29:37.985 --> 29:41.696
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.295
What's happening to him?

31:21.421 --> 31:23.839
- He's seizing. I need clonazepam.
- I thought you got it all.

31:23.966 --> 31:26.842
Yeah, yell at me. That'll fix your kid.

31:31.014 --> 31:34.267
Obviously, we missed some foreign
tissue. There's something still in him.

31:34.393 --> 31:38.479
The hallucinations and seizures
indicate problems in the temporal lobe.

31:38.605 --> 31:42.525
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you're wrong again.

31:42.651 --> 31:46.070
We didn't miss anything.
Brain scan was completely clean.

31:50.784 --> 31:54.662
Our tag must not have penetrated
the blood-brain barrier.

31:55.122 --> 31:58.791
Don't use an IV this time.
Get it right into the brain.

32:07.884 --> 32:13.681
No cells are lighting up. His brain
is clean. It is not neurological.

32:14.975 --> 32:18.811
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.648
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.279
What if it is there,
but didn't show up on the scan?

32:28.405 --> 32:30.656
What if the tag
just doesn't work in his brain?

32:30.782 --> 32:34.535
Brain cells are structurally different,
express a different protein.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.704
So how do we find it?

32:40.751 --> 32:42.543
Where are we going?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.670
I am going to think.

33:21.375 --> 33:22.833
Send the kid home.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.002
What do you mean?

33:25.128 --> 33:28.798
Make sure his blood pressure's
stabilized, and send him home.

33:29.299 --> 33:30.508
What, like nothing ever happened?

33:30.634 --> 33:32.843
We cured his bleeding disorder,

33:33.887 --> 33:35.971
removed all the damaged cells
we could find.

33:36.098 --> 33:38.808
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.352
Maybe these symptoms come and go
like the blood disorder.

33:41.478 --> 33:43.813
It's more probable that his
remaining symptoms are

33:45.399 --> 33:46.774
just a nightmare.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.109
He had a convulsion.

33:48.235 --> 33:51.862
May be epilepsy.
May be psychological. May be nothing.

33:51.988 --> 33:55.157
If the kid gets sick again,
it'll give us another clue.

33:55.283 --> 33:59.161
We can start searching again.
If he doesn't, doesn't matter.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.914
Send him home.

34:09.339 --> 34:10.673
House.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.053
You're just giving up
on this kid?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.515
You gotta know when to stop.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.184
You don't stop.
You never stop.

34:22.310 --> 34:26.063
You just keep on going until you
come up with something so insane

34:26.189 --> 34:27.523
that it's usually right.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.942
Except on my last case.

34:30.861 --> 34:34.905
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.

34:35.115 --> 34:37.700
This kid obviously
has something wrong with him.

34:39.494 --> 34:43.122
When did you develop
such strong opinions about my patients?

34:43.248 --> 34:45.374
Last week, you were convinced
my patient wasn't sick.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.959
Now you're convinced
this one is.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.463
This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.

34:50.589 --> 34:54.884
Just get together with your team,
spend a few extra hours...

34:55.010 --> 34:58.471
Well, I guess we could amputate his left
leg. That's where we found most of it.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.973
Maybe we should just
remove his affected eye completely.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.476
If you have reason
to believe that that might help...

35:03.602 --> 35:06.645
I'm not gonna start
lopping off body parts,

35:07.522 --> 35:09.899
but it's interesting
that you give me the green light.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.651
I just want you
to do something.

35:12.986 --> 35:16.071
You've been overly supportive
this entire week.

35:16.281 --> 35:19.950
Either you're hormonal,
or you're guilt-ridden,

35:20.076 --> 35:22.244
and it's too early in the pregnancy
for this to be hormonal.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.664
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?

35:33.465 --> 35:38.177
He had Addison's.
Your last patient. You were right.

35:40.138 --> 35:44.475
I gave him one shot of cortisol
and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.

35:48.688 --> 35:53.025
Oh, your mommy is in such trouble.
She's such a liar.

35:53.485 --> 35:57.446
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...

36:05.038 --> 36:10.042
How does one person
end up with two different sets of DNA?

36:10.377 --> 36:11.377
We've been through this.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.379
Our assumptions are faulty.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.507
We've confirmed two different sets
of DNA. We re-ran the sequence.

36:16.633 --> 36:20.177
I didn't say the lab work was faulty.
I said our assumptions were faulty.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.221
We assumed he's a person.

36:22.347 --> 36:26.433
Of course. The aliens didn't
just visit him. They replaced him.

36:26.560 --> 36:30.855
You're being silly. What if he's
not a person? What if he's two persons?

36:30.981 --> 36:33.232
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.

36:33.358 --> 36:36.694
Chase, you said the mom
used in vitro fertilization, right?

36:36.820 --> 36:38.028
Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.738
Kid was right all along.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.950
He was implanted with something,
back when he was young.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.703
I mean really young,
like 12-cells young.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.205
In vitro increases
the likelihood of twinning.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.540
But he doesn't have a twin.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.542
Not walking around.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.461
But in vitro fertilization
costs around 25 grand a pop,

36:54.588 --> 36:57.756
so doctors implant two to six embryos
to make sure you get your money's worth.

36:57.883 --> 37:01.719
Problem is, there's not always
enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.929
Two brothers get stuck sharing.
There's no bunk beds,

37:04.055 --> 37:07.600
so they cuddle up to keep warm,
and they never untangle.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.519
He's two people in one.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.023
It's called chimerism.

37:14.524 --> 37:20.237
Unfortunately, his brother's
like a bad doubles partner.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.032
The guy just takes up space,
gets in the way.

37:23.158 --> 37:26.535
Clancy's body thinks that
he's gonna put away the easy winners.

37:26.661 --> 37:29.747
His brother just keeps
swatting balls into the net.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.833
We gotta get him off the court.

37:33.376 --> 37:37.588
So does that mean that you can find
the bad cells in his brain or not?

37:39.132 --> 37:42.134
Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine.

37:43.094 --> 37:47.056
Clancy thinks differently
than his brother because he thinks.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.766
If we induce an alien abduction...

37:48.892 --> 37:50.684
Wait. What the hell
are you talking about?

37:50.810 --> 37:53.687
The foreign DNA has got to
be in a portion of your son's brain

37:53.813 --> 37:55.773
that makes him believe
that he's being abducted.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.442
If we stimulate those neurons
with an electric probe,

37:58.568 --> 38:01.153
we can trick your son's brain
into hallucinating.

38:01.279 --> 38:05.950
Your son's neurons will light up,
and his brother's cells will stay dark.

38:06.326 --> 38:07.910
Those are the ones we cut out.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.371
You're talking about
brain surgery.

38:10.497 --> 38:15.417
I'm talking about really cool brain
surgery. One of your sons will die,

38:15.543 --> 38:19.254
but the taller one
won't be so annoying anymore.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.674
So I have a twin?

38:21.800 --> 38:24.134
Not really.
What's on the card?

38:24.260 --> 38:25.427
A light bulb.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.888
Start us out at 10.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.311
I'm not doing that.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.021
That was all me, kid. Sorry.

38:36.147 --> 38:39.942
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.

38:40.527 --> 38:41.735
He lives inside me?

38:41.861 --> 38:43.153
Sort of.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.783
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.952
You're in sensory.
You're getting closer.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.036
What do you see on this one?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.539
Moon and stars.

38:54.749 --> 38:58.252
So I am kind of weird?

38:58.753 --> 39:01.380
We're all kind of weird.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.551
No!

39:06.386 --> 39:07.845
- Clancy?
- We got something.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.847
- What do you see?
- The light.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.599
Here they come, I think.

39:12.726 --> 39:15.978
Brain waves indicate a mild
hallucination. Neurons are lighting up.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.188
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.815
Hallucination isn't strong enough.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.400
Turn up the juice.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.155
His blood pressure's already
160 over 110. Any higher...

39:26.281 --> 39:31.243
Riding the short bus is better
than not breathing. Take us to 100.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.167
Area's still too fuzzy
to make any kind of distinction.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.419
- Crank it up higher.
- You've already exceeded

39:40.545 --> 39:43.672
the preset maximum.
Next step's brain damage.

39:52.098 --> 39:55.476
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.

39:55.602 --> 40:00.105
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.

40:22.295 --> 40:25.964
Clancy? Can you hear me?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.383
Clancy?

40:33.723 --> 40:35.933
You got them.

40:38.228 --> 40:39.603
Yep.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.856
We got them all.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.483
Close him up.

40:44.609 --> 40:47.236
Everything's gonna be normal again.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.209
You believe what
Cuddy tried to pull?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.545
What now?

41:04.671 --> 41:06.338
She lied to me.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.842
She cured my patient with my diagnosis,
then lied to me about it.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.593
That doesn't sound like her.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.470
You're right.

41:14.514 --> 41:17.474
Does sound like you, though.

41:20.854 --> 41:23.105
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?

41:23.231 --> 41:26.817
Nothing that your body language
isn't telling me right now.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.321
So what was the plan?

41:32.157 --> 41:38.537
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case
that I'd reevaluate my entire life,

41:38.663 --> 41:41.999
question the nature of truth
and goodness and become Cameron?

41:42.125 --> 41:46.253
Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth,

41:46.379 --> 41:51.341
that you solved a case
based on absolutely no medical proof,

41:51.467 --> 41:53.427
you'd think you were God.

41:53.803 --> 41:57.806
And I was worried
your wings would melt.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.145
God doesn't limp.
