00:21.187 --> 00:24.179
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear!

00:24.991 --> 00:28.757
Now... Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:28.828 --> 00:32.491
Now in the current climate, I think
it's very important to reassure you all

00:32.564 --> 00:36.558
that everything you see
on this show is for real.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.696
- (Laughter)
- Yes, nothing on this show is faked.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.798
- In any way.
- (Chuckling)

00:41.875 --> 00:43.570
Which makes it all the more amazing

00:43.643 --> 00:47.044
when you see what we've got lined up
for you over the next ten weeks.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.751
Hold onto your spleen, everyone!

00:54.821 --> 00:56.311
Whoa!

00:56.389 --> 00:59.119
No, no, no! Mayday!

01:02.095 --> 01:03.926
It's unbelievable!

01:03.997 --> 01:07.558
You look like a gay cowboy
and you look like a gay terrorist.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.427
Ah! My eyes!

01:13.440 --> 01:15.567
Oh, dear!

01:21.114 --> 01:23.548
Ooh!

01:23.616 --> 01:26.050
He is The Stig's African cousin.

01:29.122 --> 01:32.717
Uh! Ah! That's not gone well.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.493
Come on!

01:46.906 --> 01:48.203
I am a road warrior.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.037
Whoo!

01:56.382 --> 01:57.679
It's gonna be good.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.582
Right.

02:00.653 --> 02:04.054
- On... On with tonight.
- Yes, indeed.

02:04.124 --> 02:10.893
Now, every year the world's Golf GTI
enthusiasts congregate in a field in Austria,

02:10.964 --> 02:13.899
talk about fuel injection
and wear jumpers with GTI on them,

02:13.967 --> 02:16.629
and, frankly,
I'd rather blowtorch my nipples off.

02:16.703 --> 02:20.036
But Volkswagen every year
sends them a little present,

02:20.106 --> 02:23.439
a concept car of some kind,
to say thank you for your loyalty.

02:23.510 --> 02:27.037
This year, though, disaster.
Volkswagen forgot.

02:27.113 --> 02:31.948
Eight weeks to go. They had to build
something, anything, to keep the fans happy.

02:34.721 --> 02:37.952
Luckily, Volkswagen owns
lots of other car companies:

02:38.024 --> 02:40.720
Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini,

02:40.793 --> 02:43.387
Skoda, Audi and SEAT.

02:43.463 --> 02:47.297
So they had a big bin
to rummage around in for parts.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.295
What they did then, with the clock ticking,

02:50.370 --> 02:53.965
was take the rear axle and brakes
from a Lamborghini Gallardo,

02:54.040 --> 02:58.534
the twin-turbocharged W12 engine
from a Bentley Continental

02:58.611 --> 03:02.240
and the rear subframe
and sort of floor from an Audi R8.

03:02.315 --> 03:07.150
And then they put all these bits and pieces
in the body of a Golf.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.357
And here it is.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.287
It's called the GTI W12,

03:15.361 --> 03:19.991
and, unlike most concept cars,
it actually works.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.296
Sort of.

03:25.705 --> 03:30.199
As you'd expect with a car made so quickly,
there are one or two issues.

03:30.276 --> 03:33.803
The paddles here on the steering wheel
for the gearbox, they don't work.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.906
These switches here, they don't work.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.111
Satnav does work
but thinks it's in Germany.

03:40.186 --> 03:44.452
And these heating and ventilation knobs here,
they're not connected to anything.

03:44.524 --> 03:47.118
So I'm very hot.

03:47.193 --> 03:52.290
The 6-liter, 640 horsepower,
12-cylinder engine, though,

03:52.365 --> 03:54.697
that works just fine.

03:58.071 --> 04:03.509
As a result, this car will get from 0 to 60
in three and a half seconds.

04:05.778 --> 04:09.270
And it will keep on accelerating
all the way to 202.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.115
To contain all the power and the fury,

04:14.187 --> 04:20.456
the W12 is six inches wider
and three inches lower than a normal Golf.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.129
The roof is made from carbon fiber.

04:26.132 --> 04:29.124
The tires sit like smears of paint
on the wheels,

04:29.202 --> 04:33.536
and the engine is where
you'd expect to find the back seats.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.598
To cool it there are
massive intake vents in the sills.

04:36.676 --> 04:40.908
That's why the bottom of the car
is swollen like your granny's ankles.

04:40.980 --> 04:44.973
And they made all these changes
in just eight weeks.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.985
However did they lose?

04:48.354 --> 04:50.015
The funny thing is that you sit here

04:50.089 --> 04:53.217
looking at a Golf dashboard and
a Golf bonnet through a Golf windscreen,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.285
and you think, "Well, it's a Golf."

04:56.362 --> 04:58.853
But it so isn't!

05:01.801 --> 05:04.167
It's not a particularly savage car.

05:04.237 --> 05:09.038
It doesn't explode
when you stamp on the accelerator.

05:09.108 --> 05:12.009
It's just this surge of power

05:12.078 --> 05:15.411
that takes you
up to five and a half thousand rpm

05:15.481 --> 05:19.247
and then the surge becomes a flood!

05:20.253 --> 05:21.948
I can't get away from it!

05:32.432 --> 05:35.458
It is an insane car, this.

05:35.535 --> 05:38.629
0pening up a Golf
to find it has 640 horsepower

05:38.705 --> 05:41.230
is like opening up Gordon Brown's trousers

05:41.307 --> 05:45.869
and finding he's wearing
stockings and suspenders, mad.

05:46.546 --> 05:50.778
Unfortunately, there is a small problem.

05:52.552 --> 05:55.817
This car will not go round corners.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.083
(Tires screech)

06:05.264 --> 06:08.700
The wheel base is short
and it's rear-wheel drive

06:08.768 --> 06:12.204
so you have to be extremely gentle.

06:12.271 --> 06:16.298
You have to treat all the controls
like they're made of glass.

06:18.544 --> 06:22.446
Even if you're really gentle, you'll still...

06:22.515 --> 06:24.983
Yes. Yes.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.851
You'll still end up coming out of the corner
backwards like that. I meant that.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.361
Tame the understeer.
There's a lot of it. I've got it.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.365
No, I haven't.

06:42.602 --> 06:45.332
An hour later,
I reckoned I was getting somewhere.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.431
Calm! Calm! Calm!

06:48.508 --> 06:50.635
Calm! Yes.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.506
Sh... (Bleep).

07:01.854 --> 07:03.515
That doesn't work either.

07:03.589 --> 07:09.425
I think the kindest thing I can say about...
about the brakes and the suspension

07:09.495 --> 07:12.362
is they're, um... they're not finished yet.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.729
Yes, classic stuff.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.637
(Applause drowns out speech)

07:21.908 --> 07:23.705
Smoke everywhere!

07:23.776 --> 07:25.835
- You were.
- I wasn't.

07:25.912 --> 07:29.541
Let me get one thing absolutely clear.
This isn't actually gonna go on sale, is it?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.378
No, Volkswagen sent it to us

07:31.451 --> 07:34.909
cos they said, "If people like it
then we put it into production."

07:34.987 --> 07:38.889
They're not gonna get any encouragement
from me, to be honest. That is ghastly.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.222
My biggest problem with it is,

07:41.294 --> 07:45.390
that I can't see the point of saying,
"I've got a supercar and it looks like a Golf!"

07:45.465 --> 07:49.595
That's like "I'm married to a supermodel
and she looks like a traffic warden!"

07:49.669 --> 07:51.432
It doesn't make any sense.

07:51.504 --> 07:55.964
Even so, we must now see
how quickly it can crash on our track.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.840
And for that we need our tame racing driver.

07:58.911 --> 08:03.905
Yes. Some say that his scrotum
has its own small gravity field.

08:04.951 --> 08:08.717
And that because our producer
rigged a phone vote,

08:08.788 --> 08:11.279
he now has a new name.

08:11.357 --> 08:14.121
- All we know is he's called Cuddles.
- (Laughter)

08:15.928 --> 08:21.958
And he's off. Now, we know this car is frisky
but if anyone can tame it, this is the man.

08:22.034 --> 08:26.266
First corner. Twitchy on the braking.
Tires howling in pain.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.671
Back on the power. That is nicely done.

08:29.742 --> 08:33.508
No CD today because, predictably,
the stereo doesn't work.

08:33.578 --> 08:37.140
0K, through Chicago.
Nursing it round there carefully.

08:37.216 --> 08:40.150
Another huge surge of power
coming up to Hammerhead.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.743
Wriggling its hips under the brakes.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.482
He's chucked it in.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.116
It's biting backl

08:46.192 --> 08:48.922
0oh, he's having to fight it
every inch of the way.

08:50.229 --> 08:54.222
Listen to that. In a Bentley that engine
is as quiet as a startled deer.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.394
Here it's like being chased
by an imploding star,

08:57.470 --> 08:59.404
and about as scary.

09:00.106 --> 09:03.405
Winding it up,
here he comes now through the tires.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.343
0h, yeah. Looking good... ish.

09:06.412 --> 09:08.312
Just two accidents waiting to happen now.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.440
Turns in. Look at the oversteer.

09:10.516 --> 09:13.041
Cuddles is really having
to wrestle it through there.

09:13.119 --> 09:17.055
Up to Gambon. He's taking it very gingerly,
and I'm not surprised.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.388
And here we are, and across the line.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.019
Yeah. Got the time here.

09:26.265 --> 09:27.857
The time is...

09:27.934 --> 09:31.062
129.6.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.662
So, Top Gear top tip.

09:33.739 --> 09:38.574
If you want a slow car that looks like a Golf,
get a Golf.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.472
Right, it's time for a question,

09:42.548 --> 09:46.746
and the question is "Where is
the best driving road in the world?"

09:46.819 --> 09:51.222
Something that has everything, the challenging
bends, no traffic, the great views,

09:51.290 --> 09:53.758
the long fast straights, the lot.

09:53.826 --> 09:57.626
Yep. Now, it's unlikely to be here,
because everyone just flies.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.757
It's not gonna be here
because everyone's on drugs.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.357
That's all just full of ox.

10:02.435 --> 10:06.371
Al Gore says that's gone, so it's not gonna
be down there. That's full of spiders.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.033
- Signposts are gibberish. They're communists.
- Jeremy!

10:09.108 --> 10:11.269
Can't go there, the Americans'll shoot you.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.005
- No! Thank you!
- What?

10:13.079 --> 10:16.344
All right.
Obviously we did discuss this at length.

10:16.415 --> 10:19.282
We eventually decided that
the best driving road in the world

10:19.352 --> 10:22.219
was probably somewhere in continental Europe,

10:22.288 --> 10:25.985
specifically around here, the Alps.

10:26.058 --> 10:29.084
Then we decided that the best thing
for us to do was to go there

10:29.161 --> 10:30.719
and see if we could find it.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.105
This is where our quest began

10:40.172 --> 10:43.801
in the mountains above Monte Carlo
in the South of France.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.941
Obviously, you can't go looking
for the best driving road in the world

10:51.017 --> 10:53.542
in a Japanese hatchback or a people carrier.

10:53.619 --> 10:56.053
So what we thought we'd do
is bring along a selection

10:56.122 --> 10:58.955
of the new generation of lightened supercars.

11:02.361 --> 11:06.991
I've chosen this, the new Porsche 911 GT3 RS.

11:09.635 --> 11:15.471
In essence, the GT3 is a lighter,
tauter version of the normal 911.

11:15.541 --> 11:20.205
And this, the RS, is a lighter,
tauter version of the GT3.

11:24.984 --> 11:30.513
So this is, in fact, the ultimate version
of the ultimate version

11:30.589 --> 11:34.184
of the ultimate version
of the world's ultimate supercar.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.625
No, it isn't.

11:35.695 --> 11:39.153
The ultimate F-plan supercar
is what I've brought along.

11:40.666 --> 11:44.295
It's a Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera,

11:44.370 --> 11:48.602
and it's like a normal Gallardo
but it's 100 kilograms lighter

11:48.674 --> 11:52.041
and the V10 engine is a bit more powerful.

11:52.111 --> 11:54.636
That is quite a recipe.

11:56.982 --> 11:59.075
Yeah, it is if you're a fat, middle-aged bloke

11:59.151 --> 12:01.915
who wants to bore everybody
about the track days you've been on.

12:01.987 --> 12:07.152
As you'd expect, I've done it properly
and got myself a proper gentleman's racer,

12:07.226 --> 12:10.684
the Aston Martin V8 Vantage N24.

12:17.470 --> 12:21.133
James, that is just a racing car.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.641
It hasn't got anything in it,
even a passenger seat.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.837
This isn't just some road car
with a bit of scaffolding in the back.

12:26.912 --> 12:30.507
It's 250 kilograms lighter
than the standard car.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.642
That's the weight of a big motorcycle.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.209
- So you've got no radio.
- No.

12:35.287 --> 12:38.256
- You've got no carpets.
- No air conditioning.

12:38.324 --> 12:43.261
You have got a car with no air conditioning in
the South of France in the middle of summer.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.763
It's better than that. His windows don't open.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.197
- Yes, they do, actually.
- That's a cat flap.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.666
You've done the same thing.

12:49.735 --> 12:54.570
You have got standard road cars dressed
with the tinsel of fake high performance.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.665
- Has it got air conditioning?
- Yes.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.767
- Have you?
- Oh, yeah.

12:58.844 --> 13:02.177
- Shall we go?
- Yes, shall we go? It's getting a bit muggy.

13:06.752 --> 13:09.949
Right. Master switch on.

13:10.022 --> 13:12.752
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:12.825 --> 13:15.350
Er... ignition switch on.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.895
- Er...
- Faffing around.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.760
Fuel reset.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.564
Pumps are reset.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.470
Fan is off.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.939
Neutral.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.942
- Engine start.
- (Engine sputters)

13:31.010 --> 13:32.739
- (Starts)
- Yes.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.439
Excellent. Strapping in.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.846
Er... that one must go in there.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.548
Er...

13:43.389 --> 13:44.822
Oh, God.

13:51.864 --> 13:56.699
I've done three minutes
and I already adore this car.

13:58.871 --> 14:00.862
So much fun!

14:03.342 --> 14:05.810
(Jeremy) Eventually James caught us up

14:05.878 --> 14:11.316
so we turned off the motorway
and began our search for driving heaven.

14:11.383 --> 14:13.317
It didn't take long.

14:17.122 --> 14:20.091
We found something called the Col de Turini,

14:20.159 --> 14:23.617
a ribbon of tarmac
that doesn't really go anywhere,

14:23.696 --> 14:26.358
so it was quiet.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.263
Till we arrived.

14:36.041 --> 14:40.774
This looked like the ideal place
to unleash our cars a little bit.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.912
Lamborghini have used their nous
with this car.

14:48.988 --> 14:53.118
They haven't just lobbed away
all the things that you might need.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.855
It's got a thinner prop shaft,
more delicate drive shafts.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.921
The engine cover's made
of plastic rather than glass.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.268
Even the wheel nuts are made from titanium.

15:09.608 --> 15:14.204
All of those little things
add up to 100 kilograms.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.740
They were gonna ditch the four-wheel drive
system to save another 50 kilograms

15:18.817 --> 15:22.412
but today, here now, on this road...

15:23.422 --> 15:26.186
I'm glad they didn't.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.056
I was loving the Lamborghini

15:29.128 --> 15:33.224
but, if anything, Richard was
loving his Beetle even more.

15:38.737 --> 15:42.173
There is something fantastically
purposeful about this car.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.836
They haven't been flash and messed about
with trying to make it look pretty.

15:45.911 --> 15:51.076
They've just taken off what they can take off,
made lighter what they can make lighter,

15:51.150 --> 15:53.209
and away you go.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.851
This thing revs higher than the standard car

15:59.925 --> 16:03.156
so you can just keep on going.

16:13.806 --> 16:19.403
They're so smug about their fancy-boy
versions of lightweight cars.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.910
When you drive
a really, really stripped out car like this,

16:23.983 --> 16:27.043
you're put back in touch
with what driving is about.

16:27.119 --> 16:31.579
You can hear all the machinery working,
and you can feel what it does.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.149
And I was glad
I didn't have air conditioning.

16:35.227 --> 16:39.391
I don't know if you've ever picked up an air
conditioning pipe, but it is very, very heavy.

16:39.465 --> 16:42.366
And it saps some of the power of the engine.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.995
I suppose it would be
a good idea at this juncture

16:47.072 --> 16:49.597
to explain why
a lightweight car is a good idea.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.143
You see, the problem is
modern cars are very heavy.

16:52.211 --> 16:55.339
They've got all sorts of safety equipment on
and airbags.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.609
We demand luxuries like satellite navigation.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.447
And all this weight,
it spoils the acceleration,

17:00.519 --> 17:02.544
it ruins the fuel consumption,

17:02.621 --> 17:04.281
upsets the handling.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.848
And getting rid of it makes everything better.

17:18.503 --> 17:21.064
Oh, wow. Look at this. Now, look at this bit.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.406
This road is used as a special stage
on the Monte Carlo Rally.

17:32.351 --> 17:36.014
It's busy, it's twisty,

17:36.088 --> 17:37.885
it's got low walls that you can go over,

17:37.956 --> 17:40.925
huge drops that can kill you with ease.

17:43.328 --> 17:45.523
Meanwhile in the Aston...

17:53.038 --> 17:58.032
I didn't care about James, though.
I just cared about this amazing road.

17:59.311 --> 18:03.839
There's something about
stringing together a load of hairpins.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.987
What a road. I mean, what a road.
Honestly, it's...

18:12.491 --> 18:14.584
Ha-ha!

18:14.660 --> 18:19.222
Metallic rattle. I keep belting my elbow
on something really, really hard.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.993
(High-pitched whine)

18:21.066 --> 18:22.761
Oh, shut up.

18:33.679 --> 18:38.412
(Jeremy) Richard and I were now so far ahead
of Captain Slow, we decided to pull over.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.714
How's your Beetle?

18:40.786 --> 18:43.050
Fine, thank you. How's your Audi?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.454
Very funny. Very funny in there. Yeah.

18:45.524 --> 18:50.962
(James) The harder I drove to catch up,
the more unbearable the noise became.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.636
- Your Porsche, OK...
- Yeah.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.110
...is L15,000 more...

19:07.179 --> 19:08.874
- Than a GT3.
...than a normal GT3.

19:08.947 --> 19:11.142
- Cos it's got fewer parts.
- It's lighter.

19:11.216 --> 19:14.947
So the fewer parts you have on your Porsche,
the more expensive it becomes.

19:15.020 --> 19:19.582
Until you get to the point where somebody
with no Porsche gets charged a million pounds.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.287
Oh, no. Look, hang on.
On price, how much is yours?

19:23.362 --> 19:24.727
150,000.

19:24.796 --> 19:28.163
- How much more is it than an ordinary one?
- That's a pretty flower.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.896
No, how much more is it? Come on,
how much more is it than an ordinary one?

19:31.970 --> 19:35.098
- 26,000.
- Twenty-six grand. There you go. For what?

19:51.156 --> 19:53.750
- (Car whistling)
- Here he comes.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.588
Finally.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.754
Ooh, my testicles.

20:03.969 --> 20:07.427
- That is unbelievably good.
- Oh, yeah?

20:07.506 --> 20:09.303
What do we think about that road?

20:09.374 --> 20:11.638
You don't want to talk about your car,
then, James?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.575
No, we're here to find a good road.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.636
- You don't like your car.
- The car's excellent.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.239
- You know you've made a mistake.
- No, it's fantastic.

20:18.317 --> 20:23.619
Well, I think that road's a benchmark.
It's a good starting point.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.021
- Now we should go and find a better one.
- OK.

20:26.091 --> 20:28.582
- Italy.
- What? No, Switzerland.

20:28.660 --> 20:31.788
- What about Austria?
- He just wants to talk about the war.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.728
You'll get all maudlin and unbearable.

20:33.799 --> 20:37.462
- No, I think Austria is...
- Not smooth roads?

20:37.536 --> 20:40.334
- It's the smooth roads.
- It is the smooth roads.

20:40.405 --> 20:44.569
It's because his suspension's so hard.
Italy's got really bumpy roads.

20:44.643 --> 20:48.443
Italy would be quite entertaining.
We should probably look at Italy.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.589
- (Beep)
- A little beep there.

21:04.663 --> 21:09.100
Telling me I've used a tank of fuel already.
That's not good.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.063
I've got to get the seat higher up.

21:13.138 --> 21:16.699
This is ridiculous. I've got...
I'm like an 85-year-old man.

21:22.481 --> 21:24.381
(Jeremy) I was out of juice.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.747
Pardon.

21:26.818 --> 21:33.417
And although the camera crew had more,
I couldn't get it from their cans into the car.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.020
Whoa! Do you know what's happened here?

21:38.096 --> 21:41.190
Audi, who own Lamborghini,
they've built all of the car

21:41.266 --> 21:45.225
and then, just let the Italians,
to keep them happy, do one thing.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.309
- Hi!
- Oh, dear.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.677
Nice view here.

21:56.748 --> 22:00.809
- Just thought you'd stop and admire it?
- Yeah, I might need your help.

22:00.886 --> 22:04.549
- Why?
- There might be a problem.

22:04.623 --> 22:07.558
- What?
- Fuel filler cap won't open.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.526
Never mind. See you in Italy.

22:09.594 --> 22:10.959
No...

22:11.029 --> 22:12.621
(Laughing)

22:12.698 --> 22:16.725
(Jeremy) I broke out the instruction manual,
which was all in Italian.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.327
Console centrale con...

22:19.404 --> 22:21.304
intellitori,

22:21.373 --> 22:25.867
apurturri, sportello refornimento.

22:25.944 --> 22:30.040
"We are useless Italians
and we haven't built this properly."

22:34.353 --> 22:36.787
Ah!

22:36.855 --> 22:38.152
Yes!

22:40.792 --> 22:45.456
(Jeremy) 0nce we'd regrouped, we joined
the motorway along the Italian Riviera.

22:45.530 --> 22:50.695
By no means was this a great driving road
but there were some consolations.

23:05.751 --> 23:08.652
It's a symphony is what it is.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.654
The big V10 in this.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.054
The flat 6 of Hammond's Porsche.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.719
Then that brutal V8 in the racing car.

23:17.295 --> 23:21.732
The trouble with tunnel blasting in a car
with atomic power like the Lambo

23:21.800 --> 23:24.462
is that the fuel economy does drop a bit.

23:24.536 --> 23:27.596
I was doing nine miles to the gallon.

23:27.672 --> 23:28.934
Oh, dear.

23:29.007 --> 23:31.339
- Is this your second fill-up?
- Yes.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.504
See, mine's got
a 110-liter endurance fuel tank.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.878
If you need to get in my slipstream
cos you don't have much power...

23:37.949 --> 23:40.611
At no point have I lacked in power
to keep up with this thing.

23:40.685 --> 23:42.277
How many horsepower?

23:42.354 --> 23:44.345
- 415.
- 522.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.085
It's how it uses them.
It's how it deploys them.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.923
- Top speed?
- 175.

23:49.995 --> 23:52.020
- Top speed?
- 185ish.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.395
195. You're just not in the same league.

23:54.466 --> 23:58.266
This is probably quite a good car,
but it's half-hearted and limp-wristed.

23:58.336 --> 24:00.167
It's not a real luxury supercar...

24:00.238 --> 24:02.206
- This should be good.
...or a proper lightweight.

24:02.274 --> 24:06.176
James, a little compromise
might be useful in your car. Be honest.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.212
No. I love it.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.841
In fact he loved it so much,
he bought it a present.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.646
- What's that?
- I've bought a cushion.

24:13.718 --> 24:16.778
- Are you admitting that it's uncomfortable?
- Yeah. No, no, no.

24:16.855 --> 24:18.322
- Hammond.
- Hold on.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.382
- He's admitting his car is uncomfortable.
- No.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.827
That's interior design.
It's a scatter cushion to look pretty.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.798
So much nicer.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.701
My poor buttocks.

24:34.706 --> 24:37.573
Yeah, but would the weight
of that cushion be a problem

24:37.642 --> 24:40.975
if Hammond and I suddenly decided
that we were eight years old?

24:41.046 --> 24:42.877
Paddle on the right!

24:51.957 --> 24:55.449
The Lambo and the Porsche
are very, very close.

24:55.527 --> 24:59.486
The Aston Martin seems to be very, very slow.

24:59.564 --> 25:01.828
Didn't expect that in the racing car.

25:03.034 --> 25:07.300
(Jeremy) We were heading for the Italian lakes
but it was time to stop for the night.

25:07.372 --> 25:12.332
And since I'd insisted on coming to Italy,
I'd booked the hotel.

25:14.312 --> 25:16.405
This doesn't look like a very good town.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.381
They're going to shout at me.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.985
(Dog barking)

25:25.056 --> 25:27.786
(Alarm whirring)

25:28.727 --> 25:30.524
(Richard) Tell me we've stopped here...

25:30.595 --> 25:33.462
- Well, it could be worse.
...to steal some wheels or something.

25:33.532 --> 25:37.628
How could it be... how could this be worse?
That's the motorway!

25:37.702 --> 25:40.398
Jeremy, I always wanted to stay
in the Italian lakes.

25:40.472 --> 25:43.464
- Are we staying here tonight?
- Well, yes.

25:43.542 --> 25:47.000
So we're carrying on by bicycle tomorrow?
These will have been stolen.

25:47.078 --> 25:51.515
They did stay that they'd got a secure car park
that nobody could break into.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.483
And I can see what they mean.

25:53.552 --> 25:57.955
There's absolutely no way that anybody
could possibly get into this car park

25:58.023 --> 25:59.513
in any way, shape or form.

25:59.591 --> 26:02.151
- It's actually very simple.
- What were you thinking?

26:02.227 --> 26:04.991
(James) D'you know my car
doesn't have a key or a lock?

26:05.063 --> 26:07.088
Do they save weight by not fitting locks?

26:07.165 --> 26:09.633
- (Dog barking)
- (Alarms whirring)

26:10.702 --> 26:13.102
I'm really sorry.

26:16.207 --> 26:18.801
I know. I'm sorry.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.504
Sorry.

26:20.579 --> 26:26.211
That hotel had no bar, no restaurant,
no air conditioning in the rooms.

26:26.284 --> 26:28.149
No, it was like being in his car.

26:28.219 --> 26:30.881
Which is why we left the crew behind

26:30.956 --> 26:34.824
and us three all went nearer to the lakes,
found another hotel.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.793
- And the lakes are to the north.
- Yes.

26:36.861 --> 26:39.557
- And which way did you take us?
- North... east.

26:39.631 --> 26:43.226
You made us drive 200 kilometers
in the wrong direction.

26:43.301 --> 26:45.030
I did that. I did do that.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.571
But we found a hotel in the end
and all was well.

26:47.639 --> 26:51.131
- You ruined our holiday.
- I did, and I'm very sorry about that.

26:51.209 --> 26:53.769
But we must now move on
because it's time to meet our guest.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.843
Now, the star in
the reasonably priced car tonight

26:56.915 --> 27:00.681
once said that she and her husband set
their alarm clock an hour early every morning

27:00.752 --> 27:04.449
so they had a chance to make love
before going to work,

27:04.522 --> 27:07.423
much like James May,
although, of course, he lives alone.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.687
(Laughter)

27:10.729 --> 27:15.029
Ladies and gentlemen, star of everything
that matters, Dame Helen Mirren!

27:15.100 --> 27:17.000
(Cheering)

27:18.036 --> 27:20.800
You're looking so lovely.

27:20.872 --> 27:23.170
(Cheering)

27:23.241 --> 27:25.004
Oh!

27:26.244 --> 27:29.645
- I can rest now. Have a seat.
- (Laughs)

27:29.714 --> 27:31.841
I'll have a seat. Oh.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.043
I can't tell you how excited I am...

27:34.119 --> 27:35.848
- Oh, yes, you can.
...to have you here.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.581
No, I really, genuinely mean it.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.147
I know everybody talks to you
about The Queen.

27:40.225 --> 27:42.125
- Prime Suspect as well.
- Mm-hm.

27:42.193 --> 27:44.491
- But you were in The Long Good Friday.
- Yeah, I was.

27:44.562 --> 27:48.191
Now, this to me
is just the greatest film of all time.

27:48.266 --> 27:51.133
Three quarters of them
have never heard of The Long Good Friday.

27:51.202 --> 27:53.796
- They're far too young.
- Have you heard of it? Yes.

27:53.872 --> 27:55.567
- This audience, you see...
- Yeah.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.437
Well-educated.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.034
- Yeah.
- They have heard of it.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.545
Do you live in LA?
I've been trying to clear this up.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.082
- No, I live in Wapping.
- You live in Wapping.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.345
- But you've got a house in LA.
- My husband's American.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.114
So we spend a lot of time there...

28:09.187 --> 28:12.281
- Is it normal over there?
...in that car culture, you know.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.451
- Um... is it what?
- Normal in Los Angeles.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.755
No, it's weird.

28:16.828 --> 28:19.592
You'd love it because people live
in their cars

28:19.664 --> 28:21.825
and they do everything in their cars.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.596
- Um...
- (Laughter)

28:25.670 --> 28:28.798
Now, your autobiography.
I've actually read it, unlike...

28:28.873 --> 28:30.238
- No, really?
- I have.

28:30.308 --> 28:34.108
I got to one chapter where I went a bit white,
where you were living in Parsons Green.

28:34.179 --> 28:37.478
- This is in Fulham in southwest London.
- Yes, I used to hear it going over.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.076
You... What was it?
You became disillusioned with British society.

28:41.152 --> 28:45.145
Because of all the young Hoorays
living round there throwing bread rolls.

28:45.223 --> 28:48.886
- Yes.
- That was me. I did live in Parsons Green.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.985
- You didn't!
- I did.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.031
- And did you throw food?
- Yes.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.329
I used to order it
for its aerodynamic efficiency.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.199
You were one of those
ghastly, ghastly guys!

28:59.270 --> 29:01.602
Oh, my God! That drove me out of England.

29:03.341 --> 29:06.902
Now, didn't you also say somewhere this
the other day, that I was reading,

29:06.978 --> 29:08.843
that I remind you of Paris Hilton?

29:08.913 --> 29:11.643
Yes, I said you were like Paris Hilton.
Yes, I did.

29:11.716 --> 29:15.049
I look in the mirror every morning
and go, "I'm Paris? Oh, no, I'm not."

29:15.120 --> 29:19.056
No, but the thing is, Jeremy,
you are uber-male, you know,

29:19.124 --> 29:20.751
and Paris is uber-female,

29:20.825 --> 29:24.591
and I think that you're both... you're
the two sides of the same coin, actually.

29:24.662 --> 29:29.326
Well, I don't put pictures of myself naked
on the internet. That's one thing I don't do.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.801
- Maybe I'll give it a whirl.
- Actually, neither did she, to her credit.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.202
Someone else did it.

29:34.272 --> 29:38.641
Here's a tip, Paris, if you're watching.
Have sex without a camera.

29:40.245 --> 29:43.009
Now, let's move on to motoring if we may.

29:43.081 --> 29:45.072
I don't think we're gonna agree
on much here.

29:45.150 --> 29:48.017
Cos you're not really a big car fan.

29:48.086 --> 29:50.111
No, my first car was a disaster.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.452
- MG Midget. Those little white things.
- Yeah.

29:52.524 --> 29:55.618
My brother... my brother sold it to me.

29:55.693 --> 29:58.093
The engine blew up within two days.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.494
(Laughter)

29:59.564 --> 30:03.330
- But didn't you have a Golf GTI?
- Yes, I did, I did.

30:03.401 --> 30:06.097
That came to a sticky end,
my poor old Golf GTI.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.570
Why? What happened to it?

30:07.639 --> 30:10.836
Well, I was doing theater in, um...

30:10.909 --> 30:13.935
at the Old... no, the Young Vic,
excuse me, in Waterloo,

30:14.012 --> 30:16.310
and I'd just cleared out my closet

30:16.381 --> 30:19.976
and I had all this stuff
to take to the charity shop.

30:20.051 --> 30:24.317
And then I thought, "Well, you know..." There
were no charity shops. I didn't have the time.

30:24.389 --> 30:28.382
And I knew that everyone said,
"Keep your car locked around here,"

30:28.459 --> 30:30.222
because things get nicked out of the car.

30:30.295 --> 30:32.889
So I thought, "Perfect,
I'll leave my stuff in the car,

30:32.964 --> 30:35.694
"I'll leave the car open,
and it'll all get nicked."

30:35.767 --> 30:38.759
But instead of the stuff getting nicked,
my car got torched.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.031
(Laughter)

30:40.104 --> 30:43.665
- No!
- Yeah. I came out, it was like this hulk.

30:43.741 --> 30:47.006
- So what have you got now?
- I don't have a car now, actually.

30:47.078 --> 30:51.208
- Haven't you got an Oyster card?
- Yes, I do. Yeah.

30:51.282 --> 30:53.682
- What is one?
- It's a brilliant thing.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.412
It's this little thing,

30:55.486 --> 31:02.289
and when you go on public transport,
which are like buses and tubes and trains,

31:02.360 --> 31:05.193
you have this little card
and you swipe it and you're on.

31:05.263 --> 31:09.222
- Why wouldn't you go in a car, though?
- You sit on the bus, and there's a chauffeur.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.597
In a uniform.

31:10.668 --> 31:14.695
- A tramp sitting next to you, vomiting on you.
- And there are nice people... No.

31:14.772 --> 31:16.740
Can we talk about supercars briefly?

31:16.808 --> 31:19.868
- What's a supercar?
- Ferraris, Lamborghinis.

31:19.944 --> 31:22.276
Where are you on... on those?

31:22.347 --> 31:24.178
- What do you think of a...
- Well...

31:24.249 --> 31:26.410
...a middle-aged chap in a Lambo?

31:26.484 --> 31:28.213
Well, I think...

31:28.286 --> 31:31.915
Well, I just think most guys who drive those...

31:31.990 --> 31:34.322
I always thought, "(Bleep!)" you know.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.326
(Laughter)

31:36.394 --> 31:38.191
I mean...

31:38.263 --> 31:40.288
Oh.

31:40.365 --> 31:42.390
Sorry.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.162
I was gonna say...

31:44.235 --> 31:47.398
That's sad cos Richard Hammond's got one.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.940
- Oh, he hasn't, has he? Oh, no.
- He has.

31:50.008 --> 31:53.444
He's not a pillock. He's... he's a nice guy.
So I'm sorry, Richard.

31:53.511 --> 31:54.910
- Is he?
- Yeah.

31:54.979 --> 31:58.005
- I thought he was a pillock.
- (Laughter)

31:58.082 --> 32:00.676
So, OK. The lap, obviously. Was it fun?

32:00.752 --> 32:03.744
It... Well, I don't know
if fun is the right word.

32:03.821 --> 32:06.289
It was terrifying. It was nerve-racking.

32:06.357 --> 32:09.019
It was adrenaline-pumping.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.493
My hands were shaking like this at the end.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.462
It was sweat-making.

32:13.531 --> 32:16.159
It was... it was fabulous.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.065
- You did like it?
- It was fabulous.

32:18.136 --> 32:22.038
- Oh, that's all right.
- (Laughter)

32:22.106 --> 32:24.472
- Shall we have a look at it?
- (Audience) Yes!

32:24.542 --> 32:29.275
Right. Sorry about the television
but here we go. It's like being in the '60s.

32:29.347 --> 32:32.339
- (Tires screech)
- (Jeremy) That's an aggressive start.

32:32.417 --> 32:35.511
Later, harder, longer.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.884
Later, harder...

32:37.956 --> 32:41.050
Are you doing the shipping forecast
in there?

32:41.125 --> 32:43.389
Douglas, Dogger...

32:43.461 --> 32:45.691
- Hard.
- Slow.

32:45.763 --> 32:48.323
Later. Harder.

32:48.399 --> 32:52.233
- Faroe. Is that what The Stig told you to do?
- He did.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.931
- Did he tell you to do that?
- Slower. Harder.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.100
Slow into the corners and then fast out.

32:58.176 --> 33:01.907
- So it's slow. Now go. Go!
- Go, go!

33:01.980 --> 33:04.676
You idiot!

33:04.749 --> 33:08.446
(Helen) My language is bluer than that.
(Jeremy) 0h, yes.

33:08.519 --> 33:12.512
(Jeremy) Here we go.
(Helen) It's such a silly-looking little car.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.814
- Did you like it?
- No.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.860
No, it's awful, isn't it?

33:16.928 --> 33:18.452
Ooh, yes.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.758
(Helen) I liked that bit best.
(Jeremy) Cutting the corner there.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.734
Now we're really picking up speed.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.633
(Whirring)

33:26.704 --> 33:29.537
(Jeremy) That's the wrong gear.
(Helen) Is that fourth? Can you tell?

33:29.607 --> 33:33.475
(Jeremy) It was third. It was going...
(Helen) 0h, yeah.

33:33.544 --> 33:35.239
(Jeremy) She's picking up speed.

33:35.313 --> 33:38.544
This is Michael Gambon's corner,
where we nearly lost him.

33:38.616 --> 33:42.450
And round there. And there we are,
ladies and gentlemen, across the line.

33:43.554 --> 33:45.545
Whoo-hoo!

33:49.160 --> 33:51.924
So.

33:54.999 --> 33:58.059
- Miraculously undamaged in the fire...
- (Laughs)

33:58.136 --> 33:59.797
...is our board.

33:59.871 --> 34:03.204
- You had a fire?
- Channel 5 set fire to everything we own.

34:03.274 --> 34:04.901
- No!
- Honestly, they did.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.309
That's why we're in rubbish furniture.
I apologize. But this survived.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.313
And where do you think you've come now?

34:11.382 --> 34:15.341
- If this is the thespian zone...
- Yes, well, am I in the thespian zone?

34:15.420 --> 34:17.320
Yes.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.719
(Jeremy) Ray Winstone. Kristin Scott Thomas.
(Helen) Yes.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.554
(Jeremy) Rick Wakeman is not a thesp.
Well, he is, actually.

34:22.627 --> 34:25.960
- Brian Cox. And Jimmy Carr, a comedian.
- I have no idea.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.464
- Ready? One...
- Yes.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.023
...fifty...
- Oh.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.159
No. What do you mean, "Oh"?

34:32.235 --> 34:34.261
...two point eight.

34:34.338 --> 34:37.466
- Not bad.
- Which puts you right...

34:38.409 --> 34:40.900
Thank you.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.313
- Not very high up.
- So how many Oscars have you won? One.

34:48.386 --> 34:49.944
- Emmies?
- Four.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.716
- Golden Globes?
- Three, I think.

34:51.789 --> 34:56.158
Three. And now it turns out you're faster
round our track than Rick Wakeman.

34:56.226 --> 35:00.095
- Ladies and gentlemen, Dame Helen Mirren.
- What a triumph! Thank you.

35:00.164 --> 35:02.428
(Cheering)

35:04.902 --> 35:07.598
So, let's get back to tonight's big film

35:07.672 --> 35:11.768
in which the three of us are attempting
to find the best driving road in the world

35:11.843 --> 35:14.403
in these three lightweight supercars.

35:14.479 --> 35:17.778
Yes, now, we can't agree
which one is the best,

35:17.849 --> 35:20.784
only that his Aston is just awful.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.082
We couldn't agree on
where we wanted to go.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.952
I wanted to go to Austria.
He wanted to go to Switzerland.

35:26.023 --> 35:27.320
But when we left the action,

35:27.391 --> 35:32.351
we were driving hundreds
and hundreds of boring motorway miles

35:32.430 --> 35:36.457
because Jeremy said that
the Italian lakes would be brilliant.

35:40.805 --> 35:45.037
(Jeremy) Look at it.
Lake Maggiore is just fantastic.

35:45.109 --> 35:47.202
And as for the roads...

35:50.114 --> 35:52.674
(Vehicle sounding horn)

35:54.085 --> 35:58.488
(James) Us out for a day on a motorway
in an oven, essentially, for this.

35:58.556 --> 36:01.457
(Richard) This road is rubbish.

36:01.526 --> 36:05.326
(Jeremy) The traffic,
coupled with the hotel fiasco the night before,

36:05.396 --> 36:08.160
had put the chaps in quite a bad mood.

36:08.232 --> 36:10.359
We come all the way here in these cars

36:10.434 --> 36:14.734
and you (Bleep) it up because
you're a (Bleep)... ing feeble-minded (Bleep).

36:14.805 --> 36:17.467
- Are you... I think...
- Utter, utter (Bleep).

36:17.542 --> 36:19.100
(Bleep)... ing useless.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.078
Look at the color of that water.
That's beautiful.

36:22.146 --> 36:25.513
Why did you think this would be good,
you big daft (Bleep)?

36:25.583 --> 36:27.778
Trust me, Italy is the place.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.582
- It's the home of the fast car. It's...
- Shut up!

36:30.655 --> 36:35.456
I mean, why did we bother? We should
have just come here on a (Bleep) bus.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.756
There is a speed bump on the road.

36:37.828 --> 36:40.854
Oh, that's the final straw.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.400
Whoa! I'm exploring the limits of grip here.

36:45.903 --> 36:48.736
Essentially, he's brought us
up somebody's driveway.

36:50.508 --> 36:53.807
(Jeremy) Realizing
that I'd mucked things up a bit

36:53.878 --> 36:56.403
I suggested we try the other side of the lake,

36:56.480 --> 36:59.210
which meant catching a ferry.

37:06.424 --> 37:09.518
What are we experiencing next?
The world's greatest driving forest.

37:09.594 --> 37:12.757
- Well, where do you want to go?
- Switzerland!

37:12.830 --> 37:14.730
- Switzerland is rubbish.
- Laws, laws, laws.

37:14.799 --> 37:18.530
Do you want to wash your car when you get
to Switzerland? Because you can't by law.

37:18.603 --> 37:21.436
- If they're...
- Want to lower your suspension?

37:21.505 --> 37:24.269
- Not allowed.
- No.

37:24.342 --> 37:26.276
A tiny bit of speeding. Prison.

37:26.344 --> 37:28.778
Trust me, Switzerland is the wrong country.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.905
I'm not going to Austria.

37:37.855 --> 37:40.653
(Jeremy) Eventually
we arrived at the other side.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.995
So they can get the air conditioning on.

37:47.064 --> 37:50.261
- Seventeen degrees?
- I can have it about that, yes.

37:50.334 --> 37:54.202
Yeah, I think I'm gonna have 17.
It's half twelve now. It's really getting hot.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.536
Oh, no.

37:58.376 --> 37:59.866
Oh.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.839
(Jeremy) In order for the ferry to unload,
James had to disembark first.

38:04.915 --> 38:06.712
(Engine sputters)

38:09.220 --> 38:11.245
(Engine sputters)

38:12.423 --> 38:13.913
(Horn sounds)

38:13.991 --> 38:16.323
Hang on a minute.
Something's not quite right.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.021
(Horn sounds)

38:19.630 --> 38:20.961
(Horn sounds)

38:21.032 --> 38:22.932
- What's the matter?
- It's broken.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.230
- Has it got fuel in it?
- Yeah, it's got loads of fuel.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.965
(Horns sound)

38:28.873 --> 38:33.674
(Jeremy) Despite the horns,
James wouldn't rush his pre-flight checks.

38:33.744 --> 38:36.770
- Master switch. Ignition. Pump. Pump.
- (Horn)

38:36.847 --> 38:40.408
- That's off.
- (Horn sounds)

38:41.352 --> 38:43.411
- (Chatter)
- Very fast.

38:43.487 --> 38:44.852
At least it's light.

38:44.922 --> 38:46.685
(Horn)

38:46.757 --> 38:49.487
Jeremy, we're keeping
everybody on the boat now.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.994
- (Horn)
- That lady's shouting.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.554
(Horn)

38:54.632 --> 38:57.624
- Sorry.
- Scusi.

39:02.907 --> 39:05.569
(Jeremy) I can't get through there. Back up.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.634
(Horns sound)

39:07.712 --> 39:11.705
Your country makes supercars. You can't honk
when somebody goes out and buys one.

39:11.782 --> 39:15.081
That is the correct position
because that's on and the panel is on.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.813
The ignition is down. Everything else is off.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.378
Do you want get the... Let's get this.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.516
Ah-ha-ha!

39:21.592 --> 39:23.958
Ah! Ah!

39:24.028 --> 39:26.758
- Ha-ha! Bugger!
- That's the hottest thing in the world!

39:29.200 --> 39:31.168
The fuel...

39:34.972 --> 39:36.837
(Richard) With the idiot's car now working,

39:36.907 --> 39:41.867
we found the road on the other side
of the lake was a boring dual carriageway.

39:43.914 --> 39:45.939
Still, there was one good thing.

39:46.016 --> 39:50.510
We were heading north to where I'd wanted
to go in the first place. Switzerland.

39:52.456 --> 39:56.085
Oh, please let's find something good.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.321
(Richard) We did.

40:03.033 --> 40:05.968
This is the San Bernardino Pass.

40:10.274 --> 40:11.935
Wow.

40:13.444 --> 40:15.969
I think a bootful would be appropriate.

40:16.046 --> 40:18.071
Yeah.

40:19.116 --> 40:21.346
The Swiss will look on these three cars

40:21.419 --> 40:25.685
as though the Antichrist
has come to their little world.

40:25.756 --> 40:27.656
(Jeremy) But I didn't care.

40:29.126 --> 40:32.653
The hills are alive to the sound of horsepower.

40:35.866 --> 40:37.891
Meanwhile in the Aston...

40:54.518 --> 40:58.284
The San Bernardino Pass was something else.

40:58.355 --> 41:01.290
The views,
the smoothness of the road surface,

41:01.358 --> 41:04.259
the elegance of the road itself.

41:04.328 --> 41:06.091
But Richard wasn't finished

41:06.163 --> 41:08.996
and insisted we kept heading north.

41:10.601 --> 41:13.001
I wonder where he's taking us.

41:21.879 --> 41:24.211
Wow. Lichtenstein.

41:24.281 --> 41:26.181
The only thing I know about Lichtenstein is,

41:26.250 --> 41:29.879
they make more false teeth here
than anywhere else in the world.

41:30.721 --> 41:32.780
Probably why Hammond has brought us here.

41:32.857 --> 41:37.954
I do hope it contains a brilliant road,
and I've a good feeling about this place.

41:38.028 --> 41:44.729
(Richard) And so outside the, um... museum,
I pulled over to consult our map.

41:44.802 --> 41:47.669
You see, we want bends. That stretch looks...

41:47.738 --> 41:51.572
Lichtenstein was the last country in Europe
to give women the vote. It was in 1984.

41:51.642 --> 41:52.836
That is in Lichtenstein.

41:52.910 --> 41:56.402
If the population of Lichtenstein went
to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff,

41:56.480 --> 41:59.210
there'd be 39,500 empty seats.

41:59.283 --> 42:03.549
Yeah, but back to the road. If we carry on
up here, this bit wiggles. Look at those turns.

42:03.621 --> 42:08.183
Do you know this is a tax haven?
It's got more companies here than people.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.955
That is a killer stretch of road.
That's a beauty.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.394
- Shall we try each other's cars for this bit?
- What?

42:13.464 --> 42:16.365
- Why don't we try each other's cars?
- No, I like this one, mate.

42:16.433 --> 42:18.993
- Do you want to go in this?
- No.

42:22.806 --> 42:28.005
Right, so this, theoretically, is the start
of the greatest driving road in the world.

42:32.616 --> 42:35.847
I fear I may have made a slight mistake here.

42:37.421 --> 42:38.911
(Jeremy) He had.

42:38.989 --> 42:43.949
There was a cycle race on
and his brilliant road was closed.

42:45.262 --> 42:47.162
- What?
- Are we allowed to drive on it?

42:47.231 --> 42:48.630
- No.
- No.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.792
- It's shut!
- It is a bit.

42:50.868 --> 42:55.271
You've dragged me all the way to Lichtenstein
to go on a road that's shut!

42:55.339 --> 42:58.035
A bit. Completely.

42:58.108 --> 43:00.201
- Where do you want to go now?
- Austria.

43:00.277 --> 43:04.304
You go to Austria. We can't smell your pits
from there. I'm going back to Italy.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.581
(Jeremy) Reluctantly the others
agreed to come with me.

43:10.654 --> 43:12.315
So we headed back through Switzerland

43:12.389 --> 43:16.120
stopping off for the night
in the ski resort of Davos.

43:16.193 --> 43:17.751
It had been a bad day.

43:17.828 --> 43:21.491
We'd been through three countries
and only found one good bit of road.

43:21.565 --> 43:25.160
So Richard and I decided
to vandalize James's Aston.

43:25.235 --> 43:28.636
Half of me wants him
to just drive all day with it on.

43:28.706 --> 43:32.073
He'll never notice. You know what
James is like. He doesn't notice anything.

43:32.142 --> 43:34.406
He's not coming, is he?

43:35.646 --> 43:37.841
K. That's Kevin.

43:37.915 --> 43:41.078
Sounds like a racing driver's name.

43:42.186 --> 43:45.451
- And he's bought us a drink.
- (Laughs)

43:57.067 --> 43:59.126
You're all right, you're all right.

43:59.203 --> 44:02.536
(Richard) The next morning,
we headed south out of Davos...

44:04.475 --> 44:08.309
and couldn't quite believe
what we'd stumbled on.

44:15.819 --> 44:19.255
Mile after mile of deserted perfection.

44:29.566 --> 44:34.003
Even Jeremy had to concede
I was right about Switzerland.

44:36.073 --> 44:38.837
This is absolute heaven.

44:38.909 --> 44:40.774
Oh-ho-ho!

44:42.513 --> 44:45.641
Oh, this is much more like it.

44:49.820 --> 44:53.312
What was God thinking of
when He gave the Swiss this place?

44:53.390 --> 44:55.415
Plainly, it should be ours.

44:58.829 --> 45:03.664
(Richard) This road was a test of brakes,
steering, grip, power and handling.

45:03.734 --> 45:09.195
An ideal place, then, to reflect on the cars
we'd brought on our motoring holiday.

45:14.912 --> 45:18.871
Everything about this car now has come alive.
It's suddenly in its element.

45:27.124 --> 45:30.116
God, this thing just tracks so perfectly.

45:31.395 --> 45:33.886
Meanwhile in the Aston...

45:35.232 --> 45:37.097
I wonder how much more I have to endure

45:37.167 --> 45:41.103
before I can admit that this is a terrible car
and that I hate it and I want to go home.

45:45.109 --> 45:48.567
There's actually
a physically pleasurable sensation

45:48.645 --> 45:51.170
that runs up your arm
when you turn the wheel.

45:51.248 --> 45:53.648
It... It's uncanny.

45:56.954 --> 46:01.323
"Jeremy Clarkson today married a Lamborghini
and moved to Switzerland."

46:05.662 --> 46:10.725
And then it hit me.
I was in a Lamborghini in the Alps.

46:10.801 --> 46:13.770
All I need is a pair of sunglasses

46:15.506 --> 46:17.497
and some Matt Munro.

46:27.484 --> 46:30.044
0oh, no, hang on a minute.

46:35.726 --> 46:39.321
We'd all pretty much decided
that we'd found driving heaven.

46:39.396 --> 46:41.887
Well, two of us had.

46:41.965 --> 46:45.230
But then after we popped over the border
and back into Italy

46:45.302 --> 46:48.601
we found a cherry for the top of our cake.

46:55.512 --> 46:57.673
The Stelvio Pass.

46:57.748 --> 47:03.482
Fifteen miles of asphalt spaghetti
draped on an Alp.

47:04.755 --> 47:06.848
It was stunning.

47:19.970 --> 47:21.267
Shall we do it?

47:36.820 --> 47:39.152
Here we go.

47:48.432 --> 47:51.060
The drops! It's impossible!

47:53.470 --> 47:56.564
You go over the edge here,
you'd have time to phone the insurers.

47:58.742 --> 48:03.736
(James) There's no other way of saying it.
This is a magnificent piece of road-building.

48:13.023 --> 48:17.517
It's not like PlayStation, this. You can't just
press the reset button when you get it wrong.

48:17.594 --> 48:20.620
You just go through the pearly gates on fire.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.428
I hate to admit this,

48:24.501 --> 48:28.335
but this Aston is starting to make
a certain amount of good sense.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.839
Even the brakes have stopped squeaking.

48:30.908 --> 48:33.536
Climbing up now past 8,000 feet.

48:33.610 --> 48:38.309
I think at this altitude
the Lambo has got the advantage.

48:38.382 --> 48:41.510
I shall solve that, though, with some bravery.

48:46.990 --> 48:51.324
This is hard work. If I had
no air conditioning, I'd look ridiculous now.

48:57.935 --> 49:01.268
What an extraordinary road!

49:02.306 --> 49:05.935
Thank you, Italy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

49:09.813 --> 49:11.440
(Jeremy) We finished our run,

49:11.515 --> 49:16.919
and as the cars ticked themselves cool,
we knew their work was done.

49:17.521 --> 49:20.149
0ur quest was at an end.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.252
Davos to Stelvio,

49:23.327 --> 49:27.127
the greatest driving road in the world.

49:57.694 --> 49:59.662
Yeah.

50:00.564 --> 50:02.794
Well, lads, that was a good holiday.

50:02.866 --> 50:05.835
- Yeah.
- A great holiday.

50:05.902 --> 50:09.702
There you are. If you're thinking of going
on holiday next year, forget Center Parcs.

50:09.773 --> 50:11.070
Just go there.

50:11.141 --> 50:12.699
Yes, now, the cars.

50:12.776 --> 50:16.212
- So, James.
- No.

50:16.279 --> 50:20.079
- That's no on every level. Richard?
- The Porsche was fantastic. I loved it.

50:20.150 --> 50:22.311
But the main problem about that car is,

50:22.386 --> 50:27.949
I don't see why it's 15 grand more
for the RS version than the ordinary GT3.

50:28.025 --> 50:32.428
Same on the Lambo. I can't believe that I
wouldn't have as much fun in a normal Gallardo.

50:32.496 --> 50:36.262
And if you're gonna do
a special edition Lamborghini,

50:36.333 --> 50:39.427
put stuff on like space thrusters
and machine guns

50:39.503 --> 50:42.028
cos that's what Lamborghinis are all about.

50:42.105 --> 50:46.041
So hang on, we took three cars on holiday
and they were all wrong.

50:46.109 --> 50:48.168
- Mm.
- Yes, we're back in business.

50:48.245 --> 50:51.043
Yeah. Top Gear, ambitious but rubbish.

50:51.114 --> 50:53.344
- That's us.
- There'll be more of that next week.

50:53.417 --> 50:55.214
Good night!
