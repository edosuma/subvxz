WEBVTT

00:06.214 --> 00:08.007
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:08.090 --> 00:09.259
The interview can wait,
Mr. Ortega.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.261
Sergeant.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.722
I was an FBI special agent.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.765
I know how
these things should go.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.643
Sir, we'll interview you as soon
as the medic checks you out.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.326
But I don't need
medical attention. I'm fine.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.121
Sergeant.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.664
Wilson...

00:39.748 --> 00:41.833
I'm so sorry.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.085
Thank you, Frank.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.628
But you didn't need
to come down here.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.256
Yes, I did.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.008
Look, anything you need.
JAMIE:
We'd like to get

00:50.091 --> 00:51.468
Special Agent Ortega checked out
so we can interview him.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.303
I'm fine.
JAMIE:
Let's just get

00:53.386 --> 00:55.388
confirmation of that.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.140
Uh, go with her.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.851
(Frank sighs)

01:01.686 --> 01:04.355
I'll find you, Wilson.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.484
I've known him
for a long time.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.153
And her.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.947
Self-inflicted gunshot wound
to the head.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.532
Glock 17 found on the bed
next to her.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.868
Room set up
like a hospital's.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.828
She was real sick.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.122
OFFICER:
Excuse me, Commissioner.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.999
Sergeant, CSU wants you
to take a look at something

01:23.082 --> 01:24.793
they found out back
before they bag it.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.092
Excuse me.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.185
(sighs)

01:42.268 --> 01:43.812
Hey.
Hey.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.980
Hey.
BAEZ:
Hey.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.357
Don't get too comfortable.
We're on the move.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.942
We're on the move already?
Great.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.904
St. Benjamin's Hospital.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.157
Give me one second.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.158
You got to be kidding me.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.369
Mike Gee.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.163
Danny boy.
What's happening?

02:02.247 --> 02:03.289
Shouldn't you be at the
retirement home down the street?

02:03.373 --> 02:04.582
Ah.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.543
Still bustin' balls, huh?

02:06.626 --> 02:09.002
But seriously,
I thought you retired.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.380
I retired from retirement.
I'm back, baby.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.882
You're back on the job?
Yeah.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.384
I might put another 20 in
and be a lifer like you.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.302
Not for nothin',
but I could see myself

02:16.386 --> 02:18.012
putting in my papers
sometime soon.
Who you kidding?

02:18.096 --> 02:20.265
Civilian life ain't us.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.559
And vanilla definitely
ain't our flavor.
You're probably right.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.060
Danny...
Hey, uh, my partner,

02:24.143 --> 02:24.936
Detective
Maria Baez.
Hey.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.313
Detective Sergeant

02:27.397 --> 02:28.231
Michael Gee.
Just Detective.
You know,

02:28.314 --> 02:30.024
the man took his stripes back.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.359
What, they busted you down?
That sucks.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.569
Nah, man. I'm a cop again.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.736
Nothing sucks about that.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.071
DANNY:
Well...

02:35.155 --> 02:36.990
working midnight sucks.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.911
But I'll see you around.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.413
Why are you
bringing this to me?

02:43.496 --> 02:45.748
'Cause it's a ground ball.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.417
Yeah, exactly.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.877
(chuckles)
I don't get it.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.211
You don't like Ws?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.463
Not the easy ones.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.799
Let a junior ADA
handle it.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.260
Are you for real?

02:57.343 --> 02:59.596
Let me ask you a question.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.598
Why did you take this job?

03:01.681 --> 03:03.141
'Cause I was done
with the cops.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.143
Now I can collect
my pension

03:05.226 --> 03:06.394
and get a paycheck
from the DA's office.

03:06.477 --> 03:07.604
Instant raise.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.230
Wow. Inspiring.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.231
A real General Patton.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.525
Hey, it's the truth.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.779
It's the truth,
but it's not the whole truth.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.115
You took the job because
you want to make a difference,

03:19.198 --> 03:21.618
because you want to help people.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.661
Maybe. A little.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.496
A lot. Believe me,
I've seen your paycheck.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.789
You're not in it
for the Benjamins.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.291
Okay. So what?

03:28.374 --> 03:29.292
So I give a crap.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.960
Yeah, so do I.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.173
I give a big crap.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.927
Point being...

03:39.010 --> 03:40.178
let's start making a difference
around here again.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.055
And how do we do that?

03:42.138 --> 03:45.350
Bring me a case

03:45.433 --> 03:48.728
that's truly gonna change
someone's life for the better.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.397
Bring me a case that no one
thinks we're gonna win.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.860
You got it.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.654
We were having drinks.

03:57.737 --> 03:58.863
Everything was fun.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.531
And then what?

04:00.615 --> 04:02.283
He asked me up to his room.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.118
Did you go?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.454
I said no, like,
a hundred times,

04:06.537 --> 04:07.997
and then he said
that I had to see the view.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.000
And he wouldn't take no
for an answer.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.336
Okay. What happened next?

04:13.419 --> 04:15.171
He started touching me.

04:15.254 --> 04:17.214
You know, putting
his hands on me,

04:17.298 --> 04:18.257
leaning in, trying to kiss me.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.300
But you said no.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.718
He kept getting more and more

04:20.802 --> 04:22.470
frustrated each time.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.138
Finally, I told him
that I had to go.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.598
He blocked the door.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.144
And then what?

04:30.228 --> 04:32.355
This.

04:32.438 --> 04:36.025
I don't remember anything
after that.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.653
When I woke up, I...
was naked next to him in bed.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.071
And he was
passed out, so...

04:40.154 --> 04:41.823
I ran out of there
as fast as I could,

04:41.906 --> 04:43.491
and I came straight here.

04:43.574 --> 04:44.742
How long ago was that?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.911
A few hours ago.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.621
He could still
be there.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.039
Yeah, he could.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.374
Sit tight.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.334
We're gonna go see.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.171
There's an officer
outside your door, okay?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.382
Police. Anybody in here?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.635
Hello?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.435
Police!

05:11.811 --> 05:12.895
Baez.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.106
We need the name of the person

05:15.189 --> 05:17.108
this room was
registered to, ASAP.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.197
Let's lock it down.
It's a crime scene.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.677
♪ ♪

05:47.430 --> 05:50.016
(knock on door)

05:50.099 --> 05:51.434
May I help you?
I'm Detective Reagan.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.935
My partner, Detective Baez.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.228
We're looking for Mark Forman.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.313
My husband?

05:55.396 --> 05:57.065
May we come in?

05:59.317 --> 06:01.819
Yes, of course. Please.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.571
Is your husband home,
Mrs. Forman?

06:03.654 --> 06:05.073
What is this about?

06:05.156 --> 06:06.491
His name came up
in a police matter.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.242
What police matter?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.786
We really just need
a few minutes.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.162
To talk about...

06:11.245 --> 06:12.455
We're not at liberty to say.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.915
We really need to speak
to your husband.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.125
Is he home?

06:16.209 --> 06:19.462
Yes, he just got home, but...

06:19.545 --> 06:21.506
Mom, is everything okay?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.761
Uh, yes.
Go get your father, please.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.471
Is he in some kind
of trouble?

06:28.554 --> 06:29.931
I'm sure he'll fill you in
on all the details

06:30.014 --> 06:31.140
after we've spoken
to him.

06:33.017 --> 06:33.935
MAN:
Hello?

06:34.018 --> 06:35.478
Mark Forman?

06:35.561 --> 06:37.146
Yes.
Detective Reagan.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.481
My partner,
Detective Baez.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.607
We need to have
a word with you.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.113
Mark...

06:45.196 --> 06:48.324
You should probably say yes.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.992
Mark, what is going on here?
I don't know.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.953
Maybe we should step outside.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.665
Uh, I think I have a right
to know what's going on here.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.959
Let's go to my office.
I'll call you from there.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.545
Our office would be better.

07:05.591 --> 07:09.470
Be good for Mom.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.515
It's a bloodstained shirt, boss.
A man's dress shirt.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.808
I understand.
Well, Mr. Ortega...

07:13.891 --> 07:16.686
Special Agent Ortega.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.188
Right. What Special Agent
Ortega told our cops

07:19.272 --> 07:20.481
was that he heard a shot,

07:20.565 --> 07:22.483
then he went up
to their bedroom.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.568
Okay.
Found her,

07:23.651 --> 07:25.570
and then called it in.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.821
Okay.
Didn't say anything

07:26.904 --> 07:28.823
about changing his shirt

07:28.906 --> 07:32.076
and tossing the bloody one
out back.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.496
Was he asked if
he changed his shirt?

07:35.580 --> 07:39.208
Boss?
The woman whose side

07:39.292 --> 07:41.377
he never left for 40-plus years

07:41.460 --> 07:45.173
takes her own life
in their bedroom.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.549
Might he have held her
in his arms to say goodbye?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.719
And might he have
taken off the shirt,

07:49.802 --> 07:52.388
wet with her blood,
and thrown it out

07:52.471 --> 07:54.223
instead of putting it
in the hamper?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.225
And then called 911.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.896
Well, I...
Clearly, she was gone.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.690
911 wasn't gonna save her.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.234
And he was in shock,
as anyone would be.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.402
Nobody's saying that your
friend's done anything.

08:06.485 --> 08:07.570
This isn't about friendship.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.363
You don't generally
show up

08:09.447 --> 08:11.908
to suicide calls.

08:11.991 --> 08:16.495
Well, they generally don't
involve special agents or,

08:16.579 --> 08:19.081
in the case of the deceased,
a decorated DEA agent.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.709
And nobody's saying
Special Agent Ortega

08:21.792 --> 08:24.712
did anything other than
exactly what he said he did.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.928
We're all sure
that will bear out.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.765
But?

08:35.847 --> 08:38.808
We gotta clear this up, boss.

08:38.893 --> 08:42.897
By the book.
One of our detectives.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.109
NYPD needs to talk to him.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.737
(sighs)

08:49.820 --> 08:52.615
Okay.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.952
You know, if anything was off
at the scene,

08:56.035 --> 08:59.622
say the placement
or the condition of the shirt,

08:59.705 --> 09:03.334
surely Wilson Ortega knows that.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.419
A lifelong FBI agent.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.422
But it's been less
than 24 hours.

09:08.506 --> 09:12.301
I mean, he has certainly
earned the courtesy

09:12.385 --> 09:15.638
of choosing the time
he comes to us.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.475
So we are not going by the book?

09:26.524 --> 09:29.151
We are, just a different book.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.153
Okay, El Exigente,
I'm ready for you.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.906
Alexa Hente?

09:33.990 --> 09:36.659
El Exigente
The demanding one.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.120
I think he was played by
Ricardo Montalbán's brother.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.122
What the hell are you
talking about?

09:41.205 --> 09:43.332
Come on, you don't
remember the guy

09:43.416 --> 09:47.169
from the instant coffee
commercials back in the '70s?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.507
For the love of God,
please get to the point.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.633
Here's the point.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.720
And the other point.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.681
The other, the other,

09:58.764 --> 10:01.142
and the final point.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.352
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

10:03.436 --> 10:07.148
You said you wanted a case
that you couldn't win.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.482
A case. One. Singular.
Not a half dozen.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.776
Sorry, it's a package deal.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.820
You take one, and
you get the others.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.364
And may I ask why?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.700
'Cause it's a pattern
robbery case.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.036
Clearly all done
by the same guy.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.829
A pattern?

10:21.912 --> 10:23.039
Now I'm interested.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.832
Yeah, well, don't
get too excited,

10:24.915 --> 10:25.833
'cause you ain't gonna
close any of these.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.585
Says who?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.879
The Manhattan Robbery Squad said

10:29.962 --> 10:33.382
the six merchants
who got robbed at gunpoint

10:33.466 --> 10:35.593
refused to give a statement,
description, or testify.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.553
Illegals?

10:37.636 --> 10:39.847
These guys wouldn't touch a
courtroom with a ten-foot pole.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.057
And you know what,
they're right to stay

10:41.140 --> 10:43.726
far, far away.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.604
This is good, Anthony.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.190
This is a worthy fight.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.776
Yeah, well, no fight is
worth it if you can't win it.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.823
Watch me.

11:06.665 --> 11:10.086
(indistinct chatter)

11:10.169 --> 11:12.254
Hi, I'm Investigator Abetemarco.
Can we talk for a sec?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.590
No. Sorry. Very busy.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.092
You don't look busy.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.927
Very busy!

11:18.010 --> 11:19.553
Look, I'm not here
to cause any problems,

11:19.637 --> 11:22.390
I'm here to help.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.392
Everything good here.
No help. Please, leave.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.643
No, no, I can't do that.
We gotta talk.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.104
About what?

11:28.187 --> 11:29.855
Look, on August 21 of this year,
you were robbed.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.400
No. No robbery.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.945
Look, I got the police
report right here.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.738
A guy robbed you at gunpoint
around 2:00 in the afternoon.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.907
He took nearly $800 off of you.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.283
I told police, no charges.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.785
Yeah, well, it doesn't
work that way.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.745
No charges!

11:44.829 --> 11:47.832
Look, we've got to fully
investigate this case,

11:47.915 --> 11:49.959
find whoever did this to you
so we can get him behind bars

11:50.042 --> 11:52.128
and he doesn't do it
to nobody else, you see?

11:52.211 --> 11:54.630
So go, do that.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.841
I need your help.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.634
You say you help me,
not other way around.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.136
Look, I help you by
catching your bad guy,

12:00.219 --> 12:01.595
but you've got to
help me help you.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.847
Like what?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.473
Give me a description.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.641
You've got to make a statement.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.810
Maybe come down,
take a look at some photos.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.688
No, no, no, no, no,
I do none of that.

12:10.771 --> 12:14.066
None of that.
Please, leave now.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.902
Look, come down to
my office with me.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.405
I promise, nothing bad
is gonna happen to you.

12:23.451 --> 12:27.037
No. No conversation!

12:27.121 --> 12:31.333
One way or another,
we're gonna have this talk.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.670
Now, please, do it this way.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.839
I don't want the hard way
any more than you do.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.635
What hard way?

12:41.719 --> 12:45.806
You see that "A" in your window?
I got a magic trick.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.519
I can turn it instantly
into a "C."

12:50.603 --> 12:53.022
Am I under arrest
or something?

12:53.105 --> 12:55.357
No, no. I mean,
should you be?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.317
No. Of course not.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.027
But I'm in here.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.862
Yeah, well, you're in here,
and we're in here,

12:59.945 --> 13:02.198
and we're just talking.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.866
Your wife mentioned
you just got home.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.744
Where were you?

13:06.827 --> 13:09.830
Look, maybe I should
call my lawyer.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.415
Why do you want to
call your lawyer?
I just...

13:11.499 --> 13:14.001
No, you can feel free
to call your lawyer.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.212
It's fine with us, but
you didn't do anything wrong,

13:16.295 --> 13:18.547
and we're just asking you
simple questions.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.425
Up to you.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.761
I think something happened
to me last night.

13:23.844 --> 13:24.803
But I don't remember anything.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.013
Where were you last night?

13:26.096 --> 13:28.390
At a bar?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.559
Yeah.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.395
My wife and I are
getting a divorce,

13:33.479 --> 13:34.772
the kids don't know,
and it's a mess.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.067
What bar were you at?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.736
The Leonard Street Hotel.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.238
Did you sleep at the hotel?

13:42.321 --> 13:43.155
Is that where you were
coming from

13:43.239 --> 13:45.950
when your wife said
you just got home?

13:46.033 --> 13:48.744
Yeah, my wife likes
to twist that knife.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.372
Yeah. So you did sleep
at the hotel.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.457
I think so.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.126
Do you remember meeting
a young woman at the hotel?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.254
No. Nothing like that.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.381
Maybe we should check
with the bartender, see if...

14:01.715 --> 14:05.469
Listen, I-I don't want to--

14:05.553 --> 14:08.597
I-I think there was one girl

14:08.681 --> 14:09.807
I-I talked to a little.

14:09.890 --> 14:10.808
Do you remember her name?

14:10.891 --> 14:13.102
What she looked like?

14:13.185 --> 14:16.313
Brunette, I think...

14:16.397 --> 14:18.065
We went to your
hotel room, Mr. Forman.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.900
We found a woman's panties
on the floor,

14:22.486 --> 14:23.654
and blood on your bed.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.909
Oh, God.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.288
Is this the woman you were
talking with last night?

14:32.371 --> 14:35.833
Her name is Natalie.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.142
And she's accusing you of rape.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.643
Okay.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.937
Do I have to be here?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.189
Well, no, you don't have to.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.816
But we can't lock him up
unless we get

15:00.899 --> 15:02.985
a positive ID from you first.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.486
I don't want him
to see me.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.488
BAEZ: No, he won't
be able to see you.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.573
It's a two-way mirror.
You can only see him.

15:07.656 --> 15:11.118
If he's in the lineup.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.786
You-you do want him to pay
for what he did, don't you?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.955
Yes. Of course.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.665
This won't take long.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.459
Okay.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.127
Well, couldn't you just
show me a picture or something?

15:20.210 --> 15:21.170
BAEZ:
ID from a lineup

15:21.253 --> 15:23.172
holds up much better in court.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.175
If I identify him, how long
will he be in jail?

15:26.258 --> 15:28.177
If convicted,
a very long time.

15:28.260 --> 15:32.389
I don't know,
I'm not comfortable.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.142
Look, I-I know this is hard,
but you've come this far.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.853
That tells me you're willing
to see this through. Am I right?

15:41.732 --> 15:43.150
Okay.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.614
Take a good look.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.494
Do you see him anywhere?
Number two.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.495
I'll have her sign
the positive ID form

15:54.578 --> 15:56.580
and get her home.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.417
Great.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.217
Number two stays,
everyone else can get out.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.177
Turn around, sir.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.179
FORMAN:
Wait. Wait, wait...

16:12.262 --> 16:13.097
I said turn around.
No. No!

16:13.180 --> 16:16.266
(grunts)

16:16.350 --> 16:19.103
Wait. Listen to me.
Something is wrong.

16:19.186 --> 16:22.356
I would never-- I know
I would never do this.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.149
Just listen. Listen...

16:24.233 --> 16:26.735
I didn't touch anybody.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.238
I just want to thank you all

16:29.321 --> 16:32.199
for volunteering to
come down here today.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.242
Who said anybody
volunteer?

16:33.325 --> 16:35.369
He twist arms.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.205
That's exactly right.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.707
I had to make
certain encouragements.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.126
There's nothing to worry about.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.210
I had to have my nephew
mind my bodega to be here.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.586
He's an idiot.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.255
My wife is covering for me.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.756
Which means someone has
to cover for my wife.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.299
Do you know how much
babysitting costs?

16:49.383 --> 16:52.344
ABETEMARCO:
All right, all right.

16:52.428 --> 16:56.098
The more time we waste,
the more money we lose, right?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.766
So let's let her talk, and then
we'll get you out of here.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.228
Fine.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.355
I understand you've all made
tremendous sacrifices

17:03.439 --> 17:06.275
to be here today.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.651
I promise it will be
well worth the effort.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.069
You're going to reimburse us?

17:09.153 --> 17:10.279
Ah.
Good.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.363
We can discuss that,
but first I want to discuss

17:11.446 --> 17:14.450
the big picture here.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.785
Everyone in this room
has had their store robbed

17:16.868 --> 17:18.829
multiple times
in the past six months.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.664
Tell me something
I don't know.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.417
Exactly.
Okay, I will.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.252
I can tell you that
we can catch this guy.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.921
And when we do,
we will put him away

17:28.005 --> 17:30.132
for a very long time.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.925
Can you get our money back?
We need the money.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.260
That-that I cannot do.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.262
Then what's in it for us?

17:35.345 --> 17:39.850
Yeah, what's the point
of this? There's no point.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.269
Gentlemen... the person
who robbed you robbed him.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.229
And him, and him.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.981
If he's behind bars,

17:47.399 --> 17:50.444
he can't do that anymore.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.695
Think about all that money
in the future

17:53.447 --> 17:56.158
that you'll be saving.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.160
And all we need is
a little cooperation.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.037
I no testify.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.664
Yeah, that is out
of the question.
Same here.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.417
I-I understand.
I understand.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.460
But if you could
give a description,

18:06.543 --> 18:08.962
look at a few photos,

18:09.046 --> 18:10.255
this case would be a slam dunk.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.799
Easy for you to say.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.343
Hey, calm down.

18:14.426 --> 18:18.430
It's okay.
What do you mean, sir?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.515
You guarantee no deportation?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.767
MAN:
Yeah.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.352
Technically,
I cannot promise...

18:23.435 --> 18:25.479
Well, then no testify.
No, no.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.064
I'd rather be robbed
by animal with gun

18:27.147 --> 18:29.441
than put on boat to China.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.152
Look, I got to go.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.487
Idiot nephew lose
bathroom key. Sorry.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.696
No, no, no, no.
Guys, no.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.323
(all talking at once)
Give us two minutes.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.200
Just hear us out.
Just two minutes.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.368
Don't leave.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.411
Guys, come on.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.874
Come on.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.668
I guess you were right.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.380
Maybe.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.223
Maybe not.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.016
Mike...

19:03.100 --> 19:05.018
I wanted to thank you
for your help before

19:05.102 --> 19:06.395
with the lineup.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.397
No worries.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.275
Yeah. Perp didn't want
to go, did he?

19:11.358 --> 19:14.111
(chuckles)
He wasn't happy.
No, he wasn't.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.405
You really did miss
all this, didn't you?

19:16.488 --> 19:17.739
Man, every day.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.533
Every day.

19:19.616 --> 19:23.078
And it's that bad
on the other side?

19:23.161 --> 19:24.454
I'm telling you what
you already know.
Right.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.747
Vanilla's not our flavor.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.374
Mm-hmm.
Got it.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.584
Hold on.
Hold on a second.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.419
Let me ask you a question.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.921
I saw your partner taking
the victim out the other day.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.090
She was what,
about 20-something?

19:35.173 --> 19:37.217
Yeah. Brunette.
Yoga instructor. Why?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.386
So, how does a guy like that

19:39.469 --> 19:41.471
take a girl like that
up to his room?

19:43.473 --> 19:47.185
He got money.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.857
Are you saying she filed
a false report?

20:00.198 --> 20:03.952
I'm saying this book is
missing a chapter.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.997
The service is
day after tomorrow.

20:07.080 --> 20:11.418
At St. Ignatius.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.129
Maria gets in from Virginia
this afternoon and...

20:16.590 --> 20:21.470
Lucas lands tonight.

20:21.553 --> 20:25.140
It is, uh, important that
you understand this, Wilson.

20:25.223 --> 20:28.477
There are no hidden cameras
or audio recordings.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.520
If that was meant
to calm my nerves,

20:37.527 --> 20:38.612
it had the opposite effect.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.498
Yours?

20:49.581 --> 20:52.250
Simple question.

20:54.753 --> 20:58.840
Yes.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.384
So... you heard the shot...

21:00.467 --> 21:03.553
you ran upstairs.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.182
The deed...

21:07.265 --> 21:09.393
The deed was done.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.520
So you took her in your arms,

21:11.603 --> 21:16.149
and you held her...
No.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.527
You know when
your kids are babies,

21:18.610 --> 21:19.903
every time they cried,
you'd go into their room

21:19.987 --> 21:23.031
to take care of them?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.409
These weren't
newborn tears.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.955
This was real pain.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.376
And there was nothing
I could do about it.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.587
How long?

21:39.631 --> 21:43.427
22 months since diagnosis.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.433
Each month worse
than the last.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.728
I made her a nice dinner.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.815
Dressed her in her
favorite dress.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.901
Held her and kissed her.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.697
She was the brave one.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.408
She made me leave the room.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.917
She said it was time.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.545
Have you made a confession?

22:18.628 --> 22:22.674
I told the police officers...

22:24.676 --> 22:25.677
I'm talking about
your priest at St. Ignatius.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.682
Oh.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.268
Being a cop and Catholic,
we get a double whammy.

22:33.351 --> 22:34.519
We answer to two higher powers.

22:34.603 --> 22:38.231
I'm not a cop anymore.

22:40.734 --> 22:45.655
Oh, come on, Wilson. You just
don't carry a shield anymore.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.075
Yes, I made confession.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.327
If she's to be given

22:50.410 --> 22:52.954
the final sacraments...

22:57.084 --> 23:00.128
Stop.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.718
That's between you
and your priest.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.640
So...

23:11.723 --> 23:14.643
...you made your confession,
and now

23:14.726 --> 23:17.187
the priest is going to celebrate
her life with a funeral Mass

23:21.441 --> 23:24.277
and a blessing at her grave.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.368
Yes.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.496
Sorry to take up your time

23:39.292 --> 23:43.922
on a day like this.

24:00.605 --> 24:01.690
Go to your children,
prepare for the funeral.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.659
(sighs)

24:15.662 --> 24:17.038
(door opens)

24:17.122 --> 24:18.874
How you holding up?

24:18.957 --> 24:20.917
I'm scared for my life.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.961
I've never done
anything like that.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.089
I'm not a violent person.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.508
How is she?

24:28.592 --> 24:29.718
She'll get through.
She seems tough.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.720
Will you tell her

24:31.803 --> 24:35.724
that I'm sorry?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.851
That whatever I did,
whatever h-happened in there,

24:37.934 --> 24:40.270
I-I'm sorry.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.735
I will.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.737
Has any of it come back to you?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.572
I only remember the bar.

24:50.655 --> 24:51.823
Do you remember
talking to her?

24:51.907 --> 24:53.116
A little.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.075
How you met?

24:54.159 --> 24:57.245
How you struck up
a conversation?

24:57.329 --> 24:59.247
Uh, she-she complimented
my watch. We just

24:59.331 --> 25:01.166
started talking.

25:02.334 --> 25:06.922
Talked for an hour.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.717
My wife speaks to me
with venom in her voice.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.928
It was nice talking
to someone who-who didn't.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.471
I get it.

25:14.554 --> 25:17.390
How'd you get her upstairs?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.392
I'm sorry.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.144
My lawyer said
I shouldn't talk to you.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.980
You agreed to see me.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.359
So that I could ask you
to pass that along to her...

25:29.444 --> 25:31.279
...that I'm terribly sorry.

25:31.363 --> 25:35.700
Can I go, please?

25:35.784 --> 25:37.494
I'll have an officer
take you back to your cell.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.579
(door opens)

25:39.663 --> 25:42.499
(quietly):
Go ahead.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.668
Hey. Thought you weren't
coming in till later.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.461
I wanted to get a jump-start
on some work.

25:46.544 --> 25:48.755
Cool.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.132
W-What was that about?
What was what about?

25:51.216 --> 25:54.678
You just interviewed
Mark Forman again.

25:54.761 --> 25:57.305
Oh. Oh, I just had a question,
figured I'd give it a shot.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.099
Without me?

25:59.182 --> 26:00.976
What? You're getting
bent out of shape?

26:01.059 --> 26:02.978
What? You're getting defensive
for no reason?

26:03.061 --> 26:07.065
No-- okay, look.

26:07.148 --> 26:09.442
Uh, my buddy Mike Gee, he
planted something in my head

26:09.526 --> 26:11.111
and I couldn't shake it.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.238
Which was what?

26:13.321 --> 26:14.781
Just something that lined up

26:14.864 --> 26:16.658
with what I was feeling
during our lineup.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.451
(sighs) Danny, will you just
come out and say it?

26:18.535 --> 26:21.037
You're not gonna
like it-- okay, fine.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.499
Fine. Uh...

26:24.582 --> 26:25.959
I asked him how he started
chatting up Natalie.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.336
He said he didn't.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.840
She initiated the conversation.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.302
Yes. She asked him
about his fancy watch.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.178
So now you think maybe
she set this whole thing up.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.513
See, this is why
I didn't tell you about it,

26:38.596 --> 26:42.392
'cause I knew
you wouldn't like it.

26:42.475 --> 26:45.312
Actually, look at this.

26:45.395 --> 26:48.356
Her social media page.
Look at these guys she's with.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.359
They're all her age,
or younger.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.570
Mark Forman isn't her type.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.199
No, he isn't.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.243
You need to talk to him.
We can't stall this any further.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.995
Ortega needs to be
placed under arrest.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.997
Then do what you got to do.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.333
This happened in your precinct.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.251
Plus, he will listen to you.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.377
He'll listen to you.
You're the prosecutor.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.213
If you think you have
enough evidence

27:12.297 --> 27:13.548
that he was involved
in his wife's death, indict him.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.925
It's more complicated than that.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.386
It doesn't have to be.
The PC

27:18.470 --> 27:19.429
has taken
a strong personal interest

27:19.512 --> 27:20.555
in the proceedings.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.390
This office

27:22.474 --> 27:23.892
has to respect that,
to a point.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.061
And we've reached that point.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.021
And for my part, I'm just
a sergeant in the precinct

27:28.104 --> 27:31.024
within whose confines
the death occurred.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.526
But you speak his language
more fluently.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.527
Plus, you inherited
his moral compass.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.862
And you didn't?

27:35.945 --> 27:38.073
No, not like you.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.783
My true north is slightly
to the left of his

27:39.866 --> 27:42.660
and Danny's is slightly
to the right,

27:46.164 --> 27:47.457
but yours lines up perfectly.

27:47.540 --> 27:50.085
I'll try.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.920
Don't try. Succeed.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.173
At least don't quote him at me?

27:58.635 --> 28:00.929
Be careful out there?

28:01.012 --> 28:02.180
How you doing, sweetheart?
I'm good, how are you?

28:02.263 --> 28:04.349
I'm good. I'm good.

28:06.684 --> 28:07.894
(cash register beeping)

28:07.977 --> 28:09.938
$21.62.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.189
I'll-I'll put this back.
I only have a 20.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.065
Know what? Y-You're good.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.401
You're good.
Don't worry about it.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.443
Oh, come on.
No, no, really. You're good.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.112
You're good. Just go.
No, no. I insist...

28:17.195 --> 28:18.571
Look: just go.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.447
Okay.
(chuckles)

28:19.531 --> 28:20.657
Thank you.
Go, go.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.617
I appreciate it.
We'll see you tomorrow.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.577
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.578
Hey, uh, heads up.
It's on, baby.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.663
(door bells jingle)

28:26.746 --> 28:28.248
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.583
Empty the register now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.669
What's going on, huh?
Empty the register, now.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.130
All right, take it easy, man.
W-What's going on here?

28:35.213 --> 28:36.631
Come on. Get the cash.
It's all good.
Everything's all right.

28:36.714 --> 28:38.591
Everything's fine.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.593
Here you go.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.804
Quit stalling.
All right. All good.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.514
Everything's fine.
Now the safe, fat boy.

28:44.597 --> 28:45.974
All right, take it easy.
Get it out of there.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.435
Open the safe now
or I open your skull.
There you go. I-I...

28:48.518 --> 28:50.520
Listen, I just work here.
I don't have the c...

28:54.899 --> 28:56.985
Quit stalling!
U-Uh...

28:57.068 --> 29:00.155
(door bells jingle)

29:00.238 --> 29:01.489
Yeah, now you two
bananas show up.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.616
Get him out of here.

29:17.714 --> 29:21.885
(handcuffs clicking)

29:21.968 --> 29:24.471
I got two detectives
sitting on his house now.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.014
Not out front.

29:26.097 --> 29:29.684
Nearby.

29:29.767 --> 29:31.686
All I need is the word.

29:31.769 --> 29:34.147
Your word.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.400
To bring him in.

29:40.111 --> 29:44.449
You don't need
my word for that.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.499
I know it's within my purview.
I m... I meant your blessing.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.543
Did you know she was DEA?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.170
And one of the very few
recipients of the Purple Heart

29:57.253 --> 29:59.088
who returned to the job?

29:59.172 --> 30:02.717
I do now.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.178
Like you and Eddie. Two cops.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.679
Can't say as that enters into it
for me.

30:06.763 --> 30:10.225
Didn't say it should.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.602
But you said it,

30:12.685 --> 30:14.854
which is your right,

30:14.938 --> 30:17.899
but doesn't change
the point of this visit.

30:17.982 --> 30:22.028
The law is the law
and no one's above it.

30:22.111 --> 30:26.407
Do you think Wilson Ortega
murdered his wife?

30:26.491 --> 30:29.035
I don't. And he wouldn't be
charged with murder.

30:29.118 --> 30:31.037
Manslaughter. Six of one,
half dozen the other.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.206
We don't have a choice here.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.457
The coroner's report
shows that the bullet

30:34.541 --> 30:36.084
entered through
her right temple.

30:36.167 --> 30:40.922
Doris Ortega was left-handed.

30:41.005 --> 30:44.717
If I thought for one second that
the man had one iota of malice

30:44.801 --> 30:50.265
toward his wife,
I'd haul him in myself.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.101
Dad, you cannot do this.

30:54.852 --> 30:56.604
You're looking for a way
to let him walk, and you can't.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.941
Maybe you and Eddie

31:00.024 --> 31:01.818
will log 30 years apiece
in law enforcement.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.778
Again, that doesn't
enter into...

31:03.861 --> 31:06.906
And earn a whole boatload

31:21.796 --> 31:23.631
of benefits of the doubt.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.800
ALL:
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts

31:25.883 --> 31:28.177
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

31:28.261 --> 31:29.721
through Christ Our Lord. Amen.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.598
HENRY:
How long was
Detective Gee

31:31.681 --> 31:33.474
on the job before he retired?

31:33.558 --> 31:35.643
23, 24 years.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.604
Then he goes civilian
and then he comes back?

31:37.687 --> 31:39.022
You know. You miss the rush.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.148
Oh, I so don't get that.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.858
Why?

31:41.941 --> 31:43.526
JANKO:
You're a pro athlete, sure.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.820
Or you're a geezer rock band

31:45.903 --> 31:47.780
going on a farewell tour.
Matadors?

31:47.864 --> 31:49.991
A lot of them start their
so-called final appearances

31:50.074 --> 31:52.160
in their 30s,
keep going till they're 50.
But that's

31:52.243 --> 31:54.162
the same thing!
The rush of the crowd.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.331
Cops, we don't get
a rush of the crowd.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.333
We get a crowd screaming
"Get the hell outta here!"

31:58.416 --> 32:00.501
Maybe it's the satisfaction
of service.

32:00.585 --> 32:01.878
Some of us find
a nugget most days.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.963
Well, I guess there's that.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.549
Yeah. You don't think
that's possible?

32:06.633 --> 32:08.176
No, I'm sure it's possible.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.219
NICKY:
What's the thing you say to me
all the time?

32:10.303 --> 32:12.639
Something, something,

32:12.722 --> 32:14.807
a day in your life...
Find something
you love to do...

32:14.891 --> 32:15.808
And you'll never work
a day in your life.
There you go.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.852
Uh-huh.
SEAN:
I think I'm with Eddie

32:17.935 --> 32:20.980
on this one. I mean,
there are a lot of things

32:21.064 --> 32:22.023
that I really love to do,
and they don't really pay.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.776
DANNY: Not true.
They're paying

32:24.859 --> 32:26.235
knuckleheads on ESPN
right now for skateboarding

32:26.319 --> 32:27.654
and playing
video games.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.197
So there's hope
for you yet.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.824
Ha, ha.

32:31.908 --> 32:35.828
I just mean it feels like
a very long time

32:35.912 --> 32:38.247
since I had an outcome
that felt like... voilà.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.209
What, like, rescuing a cat
from a tree type thing?

32:41.292 --> 32:43.378
Or reuniting a scared little kid
with his family?

32:43.461 --> 32:44.879
Well... yeah.

32:44.962 --> 32:47.590
Well, see?
There's the nugget.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.885
Yeah, forget voilà.

32:50.968 --> 32:54.013
We're both in a business where
no one walks away all, "Yes!"

32:54.097 --> 32:57.266
The only victories
are in making it

32:59.310 --> 33:01.729
a little less terrible
for somebody.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.024
Taking a rock out
of their backpack.

33:05.108 --> 33:09.529
DANNY:
And when you can
truly say things

33:18.996 --> 33:20.832
could've been worse...
well, sometimes that's the rush.

33:27.672 --> 33:28.798
(upbeat music playing)

33:28.881 --> 33:31.467
Hi. May I help you?

33:31.551 --> 33:33.720
I'm Detective Baez. This is my
partner, Detective Reagan.

33:33.803 --> 33:35.221
Looking for one
of your instructors.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.975
CLERK:
Sure thing. Which one?

33:39.058 --> 33:40.518
Natalie?
We got to get
out of here.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.274
What? Why?

33:50.319 --> 33:52.572
That's Mrs. Forman...
Let's go.

33:52.655 --> 33:53.489
BAEZ: Thank you for taking
the time to meet with us.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.783
DANNY: Yeah.
We know you've been

33:55.867 --> 33:57.243
anxious to figure out
exactly what it is

33:57.326 --> 33:59.454
that's going on
with your husband.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.497
Yes, and I've been kept
mostly in the dark.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.498
And we apologize
for that.

34:02.582 --> 34:05.293
Yeah. Please

34:05.376 --> 34:06.586
understand that until we
actually arrest someone,

34:06.669 --> 34:07.754
we're not at liberty
to disclose why it is

34:07.837 --> 34:10.547
we're interested in them.

34:10.630 --> 34:13.301
He's being arraigned today,
and this is the first time

34:13.384 --> 34:16.304
I'm hearing from you,
despite numerous calls.
Again,

34:16.387 --> 34:17.847
we apologize. It's been
a little complicated,

34:17.929 --> 34:20.016
and we've been really busy.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.643
So what happens now?
We understand

34:22.726 --> 34:24.978
from the DA's office
and from his personal attorney

34:25.062 --> 34:28.649
that he will place
some amount of bail down,

34:28.733 --> 34:30.777
which will allow him
to be released until his trial.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.320
I can't believe he would
do something like this,

34:32.402 --> 34:35.447
put our family
in this predicament.

34:35.531 --> 34:38.784
It is an incredibly selfish
thing to do.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.161
Selfish... (chuckles)
How about embarrassing?

34:40.244 --> 34:41.746
Do you have any idea
the ridicule

34:41.829 --> 34:44.623
my children are going
to have to endure,

34:44.706 --> 34:48.127
seeing his face plastered
all over the newspapers?

34:48.210 --> 34:51.047
Actually... we thought you'd
be happy about that part.

34:51.130 --> 34:54.342
Happy? Why in the world
would that make me happy?

34:54.425 --> 34:57.553
Well, because the more
public shame he receives,

34:57.637 --> 34:59.680
the more likely it is that
you'll receive full custody

34:59.764 --> 35:00.848
of the children in your divorce.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.642
Excuse me?

35:02.725 --> 35:04.101
He said, the more public...
I heard

35:05.853 --> 35:07.855
what he said, thank
you very much.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.358
You want to tell me exactly
what's going on here?

35:10.441 --> 35:11.818
We were hoping you'd tell us
exactly what's going on here.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.528
Tell you what?
Why it is

35:13.611 --> 35:15.863
that you hired your
Flywheel instructor

35:15.947 --> 35:17.657
to seduce your husband,
drug your husband,

35:17.740 --> 35:19.200
and then file
a false rape charge

35:19.283 --> 35:21.786
against your husband?

35:21.869 --> 35:22.912
(exhaling):
Okay.

35:22.995 --> 35:26.249
I've had enough.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.167
I'm not gonna be insulted
like this in my own home.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.794
I need you to leave
right this minute.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.712
I'm afraid
we can't do that.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.590
Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.009
I said get out
of my home, now.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.763
Let me be equally clear. No.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.849
That is, until you've
watched this first.

35:42.932 --> 35:43.850
NATALIE:
She said the accusation

35:43.933 --> 35:44.851
would be enough to ruin him.

35:44.934 --> 35:45.852
DANNY:
Mrs. Forman, you mean.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.062
NATALIE:
Yes. That was our deal.

35:48.145 --> 35:49.188
I get him to like me,
invite me to his room,

35:49.272 --> 35:50.565
then slip something in his drink
to make him pass out.

35:50.648 --> 35:51.732
This is nonsense.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.067
DANNY:
How much?

35:53.150 --> 35:54.861
Ten thousand.

35:54.944 --> 35:55.778
Ten thousand, yet you didn't
want to pick him

35:55.862 --> 35:57.405
out of a lineup. Why?

35:57.488 --> 35:59.031
'Cause it wasn't supposed
to go this far.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.908
She never said anything
about sending him to jail.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.201
I was supposed
to recant eventually,

36:02.285 --> 36:04.370
start confusing things.

36:04.453 --> 36:05.746
So what changed?

36:05.830 --> 36:06.747
She offered me
another 30,000.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.541
That is a lie!

36:08.624 --> 36:12.003
Ridiculous
statements from a...

36:12.086 --> 36:14.881
unhinged, completely
unreliable little Flywheel...

36:14.964 --> 36:16.757
Flywheel instructor who turned
her cell phone over to us

36:16.841 --> 36:18.926
containing all
of the text messages

36:19.010 --> 36:20.887
between you and her
on the subject

36:22.680 --> 36:23.764
of framing your husband.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.058
(sighs)
Oh, God.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.312
Yeah. Exactly.

36:38.404 --> 36:40.781
(quietly):
Come on.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.699
There you go.
Thank you, Joe.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.285
I got to tell you, Erin,

36:44.368 --> 36:46.621
I'm really proud of you.
Yeah? Why is that?

36:46.704 --> 36:49.123
You took on these cases
no one else wanted.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.834
You developed a plan, you
executed, and you closed.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.961
You're really enjoying
yourself, aren't you?

36:54.045 --> 36:56.464
This steak is delicious.
Absolutely.

36:56.547 --> 36:57.965
I'm not talking about the steak.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.342
Then what?

36:59.425 --> 37:00.760
The gloating.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.095
I'm complimenting you.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.764
My plan fell flat on its face.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.307
You solved all the cases,

37:06.390 --> 37:08.809
and now you're
rubbing my nose in it.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.312
Is that what's happening here?

37:11.395 --> 37:13.189
Yes, it is, Anthony.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.816
Well, in that case...

37:15.900 --> 37:17.902
I'm really
enjoying myself.

37:17.985 --> 37:19.612
A salut.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.991
And I was amazing.
(chuckles)

37:25.910 --> 37:29.664
Mm-mm-mm.
(chuckles)

37:29.747 --> 37:31.707
The taste of victory. Mmm.

37:38.255 --> 37:39.799
Mmm!

37:39.882 --> 37:41.676
Oh, hey, Mike.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.552
Your wife called
and left a message.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.012
All right. Thank you.
Uh,

37:45.096 --> 37:46.180
it was good to
talk to Regina.

37:46.263 --> 37:48.265
It's, it's been
a while.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.852
Regina's a keeper.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.063
She told me about
your son's illness.

37:54.146 --> 37:57.858
Just wanted to say sorry.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.735
He's a tough kid.
He'll pull through.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.196
And Regina?

38:02.279 --> 38:04.156
Regina's a rock.
You know how Regina is.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.867
How about you?
How you doing?

38:06.951 --> 38:11.205
I'll do, you know,
what I need to do.

38:11.288 --> 38:13.249
Your son's illness is why you
came back on the job, isn't it?

38:13.332 --> 38:16.252
Look, Mike...

38:16.335 --> 38:17.712
Anything you need,
and I mean anything at all...

38:17.795 --> 38:19.922
I'm here for you.

38:20.923 --> 38:23.175
All right. Appreciate it.
Thank you.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.387
Hey, Mike?
What you said

38:26.470 --> 38:29.223
before about missing the job
and not feeling complete

38:30.307 --> 38:32.059
without the shield...
true or false?

38:37.481 --> 38:39.150
It's true.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.408
I figured.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.416
Come on in.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.209
Nice.

38:57.293 --> 39:00.171
It's a work in progress.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.630
(sighs)
What isn't?

39:01.714 --> 39:03.758
Coffee?

39:03.841 --> 39:05.676
A quick one.
I'm idling

39:09.847 --> 39:12.099
at the curb.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.980
Hmm...

39:18.064 --> 39:20.566
How was the funeral?
Oh...

39:20.649 --> 39:21.776
you know...

39:23.027 --> 39:24.945
Yeah.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.614
One of two things
happened.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.616
She couldn't bring herself
to pull the trigger

39:28.699 --> 39:32.119
and she begged him...

39:32.203 --> 39:34.413
or he took it upon himself,
with her blessing.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.957
You think he'll confess?

39:37.041 --> 39:39.627
He already has.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.879
She couldn't have received
the funeral mass

39:41.962 --> 39:43.631
or the burial in
the Catholic Church

39:45.257 --> 39:49.303
if she was a suicide.

39:49.386 --> 39:51.806
Wilson would've had
to confess to his priest

39:51.889 --> 39:54.934
that he was the one.

39:55.017 --> 39:57.103
And so condemning himself
in the afterlife,

39:59.105 --> 40:02.316
in the eyes of the Church.

40:02.399 --> 40:06.153
We don't make the rules.

40:06.237 --> 40:10.157
(sighs) Look, I'm sorry
if I hung you out to dry,

40:10.241 --> 40:13.702
but he deserved the grace

40:15.413 --> 40:17.164
to gather his children
and bury his wife.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.459
Don't you think?

40:20.543 --> 40:23.754
Yes.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.883
Summons him to appear
in the morning

40:27.967 --> 40:32.555
with a recommendation
of leniency to the DA's office.

40:32.638 --> 40:35.224
Class "E" felony.
Criminally negligent homicide.

40:35.307 --> 40:36.517
Maybe he gets probation?

40:36.600 --> 40:39.937
No guarantee of that.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.731
No guarantees of anything.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.317
Just the effort.

40:46.735 --> 40:51.073
I'll take care of it.

40:59.248 --> 41:02.084
(sighs) Thank you.

41:04.962 --> 41:08.299
Your mom...

41:09.758 --> 41:12.344
...for her, there wasn't
an option. You just fight.

41:13.929 --> 41:16.223
But... it was hard.

41:16.307 --> 41:20.019
She made me promise
not to tell you guys

41:20.102 --> 41:21.979
how really bad it was for her,

41:27.193 --> 41:30.571
toward the end.

41:30.654 --> 41:33.616
Given a lifetime of true love

41:33.699 --> 41:36.702
for another person,

41:37.870 --> 41:41.248
if the circumstances
are right...

41:41.332 --> 41:46.128
The opposite, actually.

41:46.212 --> 41:49.173
If the circumstances
are as wrong as they can get

41:52.426 --> 41:54.762
for that person that you love...

41:59.225 --> 42:03.187
...anybody's capable
of anything.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.194
I don't know, but I can imagine.

42:24.541 --> 42:26.460
I pray you'll never know.
