00:01.044 --> 00:02.611
- Previously on Nashville...

00:02.654 --> 00:04.352
- Talk to the press,
The Movement will sue you

00:04.395 --> 00:06.571
for every penny you'’re worth.
You will have nothing.

00:06.615 --> 00:09.096
You family will have nothing.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.706
- Avery, she'’s burning up.

00:10.749 --> 00:11.968
- Yeah!

00:12.012 --> 00:13.361
- Do you know where
granddad is?

00:13.404 --> 00:15.015
- Actually haven'’t seen him.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.364
- He hasn'’t really been
around the house that much.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.843
Keeps disappearing on us.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.716
- He better not be drinking.

00:20.759 --> 00:21.978
He'’s drinking,
he'’s out of my house.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.675
- He'’s upstairs.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.547
- Maddie!
Maddie!

00:25.590 --> 00:28.071
- You knew!
You son of a bitch, you knew.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.812
I cannot believe it!

00:31.248 --> 00:32.989
- Juliette Barnes is
now claiming that

00:33.033 --> 00:36.166
the Movement for Coherent
Philosophy is a cult.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.863
The famous pop star
has suffered a slew

00:37.907 --> 00:39.996
of setbacks in
the last few months

00:40.040 --> 00:42.607
including her infamous
onstage meltdown

00:42.651 --> 00:44.740
and the scandal
involving Maddie Jaymes.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.047
Whatever the truth may--

00:47.090 --> 00:50.441
- No setbacks for me.
Right, little lady?

00:57.448 --> 00:59.146
- Let'’s see who's at the door.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.069
- Hey.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.722
- You didn'’t have
to ring the doorbell.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.594
- Yeah, I don'’t know,
I just felt like I should.

01:12.637 --> 01:13.595
It'’s crazy out there.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.205
- Tell me about it.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.555
- Hey, Sweet Pea.
- I think she'’s running a fever.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.472
Hmm, I mean, I can'’t tell.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.039
She feels fine, I think.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.650
- Look, I know you expected
to see her today.

01:25.694 --> 01:29.437
But I feel bad making her
go through that.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.656
- I'’m sorry.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.658
There'’s been a lot going on.

01:33.702 --> 01:36.270
- It'’s all right. I get it.
How are you holding up?

01:36.313 --> 01:39.055
- Well, I'’m not
going down without a fight.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.932
- Go away!

01:46.976 --> 01:48.412
- I have coffee.

01:52.286 --> 01:53.635
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:55.593 --> 01:56.551
Are you okay?

01:56.594 --> 01:58.335
- No.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.600
Why does he keep calling me?

02:05.516 --> 02:06.822
- I caught him and Mia.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.781
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was terrible.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.696
- I'’m so sorry.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.524
How are you gonna
go on tour with him?

02:13.568 --> 02:15.265
- I'’m not gonna
go on tour with him.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.965
- I can stay home
if you need anything.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.359
- Nice try, Daphne.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.058
Did you put vanilla
ice cream in this?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.583
- Yep.

02:28.626 --> 02:29.975
- Mm-hmm.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.197
- Hey, man,
I'’m sorry I'm late.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.156
Apparently, traffic in
Nashville is now a thing.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.288
- No, uh...
Thanks... Thanks for coming.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.596
- Yeah, I'’m fine.
It'’s actually not about me.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.903
- Looks like Dell is gonna
have to shut down the ranch.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.211
- Yeah. She couldn'’t
make the payments.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.518
Never really made enough money
to keep it running anyway, so...

02:50.561 --> 02:53.173
- Oh, no.

02:53.216 --> 02:58.526
- But I was thinking maybe we
could throw a benefit concert

02:58.569 --> 03:00.528
and help her out.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.791
- Sounds like a great idea.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.619
You want me to sing, don'’t you?

03:04.662 --> 03:06.403
- You could do
some magic tricks.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.796
Juggle or something.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.145
- You'’re shameless.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.463
- Ugh.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.204
- Where are the elves
when you need them?

03:27.381 --> 03:29.252
Since when do you drink tea?

03:29.296 --> 03:30.775
- Doctor'’s orders.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.473
- But you'’re gonna
be okay, though, right?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.257
- Don'’t worry, Gunnar.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.867
I'’ll be around to bug you
for a long time.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.695
- Well, good.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.044
Means I don'’t have to keep being
super nice to you all the time.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.350
- I hadn'’t noticed that.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.268
So what you got lined up, man?
You got any gigs?

03:45.312 --> 03:46.878
Oh, sorry.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.185
- No, it'’s fine.
I love not having a band

03:49.229 --> 03:50.969
and not having a girlfriend.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.494
- We should have been
more like Fleetwood Mac.

03:53.537 --> 03:56.366
They all slept together.
Worked out great.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.064
- Enjoy your tea.

03:59.108 --> 04:02.590
- I didn'’t...well,
yeah, I kinda did.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.287
- We were at the County Fair

04:04.331 --> 04:06.898
and your dad wanted
to pet the llamas.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.335
- I thought they were camels.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.336
- So cute.

04:09.379 --> 04:10.859
- So I lift him up.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.818
And he'’s petting
the llama all very sweet.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.995
Until the damn thing
hauls off and bites him.

04:17.039 --> 04:19.520
- Hard too!
Hurt like hell.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.304
- So I throw him in the car
and we race to the doctor.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.827
- Dad, I'’m sorry.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.264
Mom threw me in the car
and took me to the doctor.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.613
You didn'’t take me
to the doctor.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.702
- I beg your pardon.
It was me.

04:27.745 --> 04:30.792
He screamed so loud,
I thought they could hear him

04:30.835 --> 04:32.228
in the next county.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.012
- Mom didn'’t take me
to the doctor?

04:34.056 --> 04:36.450
- Beverly didn'’t want to leave.
So the two of them stayed.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.712
- That'’s right.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.845
Huh.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.499
Memory'’s a funny thing, huh?

04:42.543 --> 04:45.633
- Yeah. Sorry I wasn'’t around
for more of them.

04:47.939 --> 04:52.683
- Well, I missed my share
of moments with these two.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.642
- You made up for it.

04:54.685 --> 04:57.297
- Wish that was true,
sweetheart.

04:57.340 --> 05:00.430
I do know one thing.
Ever since I quit drinking,

05:00.474 --> 05:03.259
life has become
a whole lot more vivid.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.001
I like it this way.
You know what I mean?

05:06.044 --> 05:08.482
- I think I do.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.876
- Yeah, I think you do too.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.978
- So, give me that.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.240
- You don'’t want
that yet, Dad.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.764
You gotta tighten
it down first.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.853
- I have done this once or
twice before, you know.

05:31.896 --> 05:34.421
- Okay. Yeah, I believe you.
- And you know everything...

05:34.464 --> 05:35.726
- I don'’t know everything.

05:35.770 --> 05:36.684
I just know you want
to tighten it.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.689
- Whippersnapper...

05:42.733 --> 05:45.257
- Hey, all.

05:45.301 --> 05:46.650
- Hey, Scarlett.

05:46.694 --> 05:49.392
- There is my beautiful
granddaughter.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.220
- Well, I don'’t wanna interrupt.
This looks kind of serious.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.830
What the hell is it?

05:52.874 --> 05:55.224
- Daphne wanted a new
bedside table for her room.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.486
So I thought I...

05:56.530 --> 05:59.620
- We thought we...
I smell chicken.

05:59.663 --> 06:02.013
- Hot chicken. Come on.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.928
- I could use a break.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.235
- Sure is lovely seeing
y'’all be together.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.889
- Well, we haven'’t killed each
other yet, so that'’s good.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.064
- Oh, good.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.414
- Ignore him.
How you doing?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.677
- I'’m good. Thank you.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.026
Hey, this might interest you.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.159
There'’s gonna be
a benefit at the ranch.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.117
And, um, I'’m gonna sing.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.644
- Yeah.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.036
- All right!

06:25.080 --> 06:26.734
I don'’t believe it.
- Believe it.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.257
- Well, I want four tickets.
And don'’t you cancel.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.650
- I said I'’m doing it,
I'’m gonna do it.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.782
- She said she'’s doing it.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.350
This family sure
has a lock on talent.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.658
- Some of us embrace it more
than others, right, Scarlett?

06:37.701 --> 06:39.442
- Eat your chicken.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.835
- It'’s been real
exciting following

06:40.878 --> 06:42.314
your progress on
"Nashville'’s Next".

06:42.358 --> 06:44.316
And congratulations on
making it to the finals.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.840
- Thank you so much.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.189
- Do you miss having your
sister by your side

06:47.232 --> 06:48.669
when you'’re out
there on the stage?

06:48.712 --> 06:51.367
- For sure, but I don'’t know.
I mean...

06:51.411 --> 06:53.891
It'’s definitely nice to just
be myself for a change.

06:53.935 --> 06:54.979
- Well, you sure are
doing a great job.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.416
You must be excited.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.895
- I'’m so excited.
It'’s so fun.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.201
- We want to wish you
the best of luck.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.463
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.986
- It was nice to meet you.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.945
- Hello!
Look at you!

07:03.988 --> 07:05.860
Oh, my gosh,
you'’re big time now.

07:05.903 --> 07:07.470
That'’s so cool
being interviewed.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.559
- I know.
It feels weird.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.082
I feel like I haven'’t
even done anything yet.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.607
- And it'’s all happening
for you for real.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.739
I'’m kind of jealous.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.785
- That'’s really cool.

07:24.356 --> 07:27.447
- How are you...
- So...you first.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.627
- I'’m good.

07:35.890 --> 07:39.328
- He'’s, um...
He'’s doing real good.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.373
He'’s dealing with PTSD,
so that'’s kind of...

07:41.417 --> 07:43.419
- Yeah. It must be hard.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.769
- It is, but
he'’s doing better.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.469
How'’s Alannah?

07:49.512 --> 07:52.210
- Alannah'’s fine, yeah.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.604
We were a thing and
now we'’re not a thing.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.824
It wasn'’t really
that big of a thing.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.828
It'’s good to see you.

08:00.871 --> 08:03.265
- Thanks.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.053
- Oh, I'’m just trying
to figure out

08:09.097 --> 08:10.098
who I wanna be when I grow up.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.752
How are you really?

08:11.795 --> 08:14.363
- Trying to figure out who
I wanna be when I grow up.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.366
- Why does everybody
always ask you that

08:17.409 --> 08:18.889
when you'’re not writing?

08:18.933 --> 08:20.630
- Well, I'’m asking
because there'’s gonna be

08:20.674 --> 08:22.414
a benefit at the ranch.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.766
I know they'’d love it if
you'’d play, if you want to.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.158
- To be honest,
I haven'’t come up with

08:27.202 --> 08:28.769
anything new in
a while, so...

08:28.812 --> 08:30.422
- Tell me about it.

08:30.466 --> 08:35.645
But if I gotta face it,
you might as well, too.

08:35.689 --> 08:36.820
- Yeah.

08:38.735 --> 08:42.522
- ♪ Now we'’re falling, falling ♪

08:42.565 --> 08:46.743

- Well, I just can'’t keep
you guys apart, can I, huh?

09:26.870 --> 09:28.742
How goes it?

09:28.785 --> 09:31.571
Hey, you still at
Renegade, huh?

09:31.614 --> 09:33.747
Let me know when you'’re ready to
come over to Shiny, all right?

09:33.790 --> 09:35.836
If you want a
real career, that is.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.534
- I'’ll keep that in mind.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.232
- How'’s it going there,
my girl, huh?

09:41.276 --> 09:42.451
You'’re writing your
own stuff, I hope.

09:42.494 --> 09:43.887
- Yes, Brad, I am.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.236
When can I hear some?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.673
- When it'’s ready.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.345
Are you not talking to me?

10:07.389 --> 10:08.912
- I'’m thinking about it.

10:11.219 --> 10:12.655
I'’m sorry for what I did to you.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.266
- I just can'’t
even believe you.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.399
- I know.
It was horrible, okay?

10:17.442 --> 10:19.662
But I knew whatever
I was gonna do,

10:19.706 --> 10:21.969
I was gonna be a terrible
person regardless.

10:22.012 --> 10:25.059
- Well, I guess covering up
for Jonah really

10:25.102 --> 10:26.887
is your main job, so...

10:26.930 --> 10:30.107
- Okay, yep.
I deserve it.

10:30.151 --> 10:31.543
Deserve whatever
you throw at me.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.502
- He treats you
like crap, Twig!

10:33.545 --> 10:35.330
- Yeah. You don'’t think
I know that?

10:35.373 --> 10:37.506
But it'’s not like that easy
to go out and find a job, okay?

10:37.549 --> 10:40.204
I didn'’t have
everything handed to me.

10:41.771 --> 10:44.165
- No! I'’m talking
about me, okay?

10:44.208 --> 10:46.733
I didn'’t have anything
before Jonah, all right?

10:46.776 --> 10:49.083
I pity you.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.172
You'’re throwing your
life away, Twig.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.956
For what?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.697
Fake job with fake friends?

10:54.741 --> 10:55.742
- He'’s not a fake friend.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.962
- Oh, sorry. You'’re right.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.747
He'’s a fake human being.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.357
You'’re pathetic.
- Maddie...

11:02.400 --> 11:03.880
- I can'’t talk to you right now.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.887
- Thanks for the food.

11:13.281 --> 11:16.197
- You hardly ate anything.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.546
How'’s it going with Avery?

11:17.589 --> 11:19.940
- It seems that he
has moved on.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.463
- I don'’t believe it.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.943
- Oh, it'’s true.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.206
I'’ve actually met her.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.860
- I'’m so sorry.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.688
- This is all on me.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.472
I'’ve just put him
through way too much.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.822
- Oh, don'’t be
so hard on yourself.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.959
What'’s wrong?

11:39.002 --> 11:40.308
- I'’m pregnant.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.921
- Oh, my God.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.575
And you haven'’t told him?

11:46.618 --> 11:51.623
- No, and I'’m not going to.
At least, not now.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.364
- That'’s crazy!

11:53.408 --> 11:54.888
- Avery'’s fallen in love.

11:54.931 --> 11:58.326
I'’m not gonna manipulate him
to get him back.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.154
- But it'’s his baby.

12:00.197 --> 12:04.375
- I know, and he'’s the most
incredible man in the world.

12:04.419 --> 12:07.639
And he would immediately
be there for me if he knew.

12:09.554 --> 12:12.035
But that doesn'’t mean
he could ever love me again.

12:23.786 --> 12:24.961
- You again.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.748
Don'’t look at me like that.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.652
- I think it might
be permanent.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.828
- You always think that.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.787
- Well, this time
it'’s different.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.571
- Well, maybe stop trying.

13:09.614 --> 13:13.096
Why don'’t you go out and
have some fun for a change?

13:13.140 --> 13:14.837
- I don'’t wanna go out
and have fun!

13:14.881 --> 13:17.100
- Oh. Okay.

13:17.144 --> 13:19.973
Well, I'’m gonna go out,
and see Steve Earle tonight.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.191
I'’m gonna have a ton of fun.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.585
- Yeah.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.326
- I don'’t believe it, man!

13:25.369 --> 13:26.718
Why didn'’t you tell me
he was playing a show here?

13:26.762 --> 13:27.719
You know how much
I love Steve Earle!

13:27.763 --> 13:29.417
- Sorry.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.418
- Of course,
it'’s sold out now, right?

13:30.461 --> 13:31.811
- Yeah, of course it is.

13:31.854 --> 13:32.986
- I hate you.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.381
- It'’s for you.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.254
- Yeah. I bought it for
you like a week ago.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.559
- You did not!

13:41.603 --> 13:43.083
- Have fun.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.911
- Oh, my God! I love you!
I love you!

13:44.954 --> 13:46.216
I'’m sorry! I'm sorry.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.785
Yes! Yes!

13:51.526 --> 13:53.223
- Well, this is...
- Yeah.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.666
Gideon?

14:27.127 --> 14:28.693
- Oh, I got you, bro.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.913
Yes!

14:30.957 --> 14:32.959
Nothing!

14:34.308 --> 14:35.875
- Yeah.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.268
I just...I can'’t...not now.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.835
Serve up

14:42.185 --> 14:43.360
Okay, what do you
want me to do?

14:43.404 --> 14:44.666
Really?

14:44.709 --> 14:45.972
Maddie'’s not even
speaking to me.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.495
- Yeah. I wonder why.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.062
- Look, I know it'’s my fault.

14:50.585 --> 14:53.153
You just destroy her and
then forget about her?

14:53.196 --> 14:54.676
- Dude, she'’s never
gonna forgive me.

14:54.719 --> 14:55.895
- Yeah! And it'’s
always all about you.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.505
It'’s all about you.

14:57.548 --> 15:00.290
You know, she cared about you
and she believed in you.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.380
And you, dude, you treated
her like a thing.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.949
- You didn'’t deserve her.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.820
- You'’re right.

15:08.864 --> 15:11.954
Is that what you
want me to say?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.564
It'’s history now.
- Right, yeah.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.524
You just gotta move on,
you know.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.612
- You gotta grow up.
- Yeah, I did.

15:17.655 --> 15:20.658
What does that mean?

15:20.702 --> 15:22.617
- I told her where
you were that night.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.185
- Yeah! I'’m sick of covering
for you, dude!

15:25.228 --> 15:27.143
- I cover for you!

15:27.187 --> 15:29.885
You'’d be bagging groceries
right now if it wasn'’t for me.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.323
I should fire you.
- Do it.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.935
- I will if you don'’t
apologize to me.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.371
- Okay, all right.

15:37.414 --> 15:41.244
I'’m sorry that
you'’re such an ass.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.332
- Piss off!
- You piss off!

15:42.376 --> 15:43.420
- Piss off!

15:46.293 --> 15:47.947
- Oh!

15:52.473 --> 15:54.475
Dude, that frickin'’ hurt!
- Good!

15:58.261 --> 16:01.395
- Oh, man, I'’m such an idiot.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.225
It'’s only a matter of time
before everyone knows it.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.096
- Yeah. Not a moment too soon.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.364
- Come on, let'’s go
get a beer.

16:21.197 --> 16:24.635
- Call a press conference.
I'’m putting an end to this.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.507
- Juliette,
you gotta let this go.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.205
- The Movement headquarters,
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.120
- This is crazy!
Don'’t do it.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.255
The only thing that would
be crazy is if I keep silent.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.344
9:00 a.m.!

16:39.911 --> 16:42.436
- Thank you.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.785

You'’ll cut yourself.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.578
- I'’m fine.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.626
- I'’ve been a little
under the weather.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.497
Having trouble sleeping.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.544
It'’s not what you think.
I can handle this.

18:30.587 --> 18:33.112
- Yeah. I understand.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.550
- But can'’t we just keep
this between the two of us?

18:36.593 --> 18:39.205
We don'’t want
to worry your dad.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.641
Not if we don'’t have to.

18:45.428 --> 18:46.995
See you in the morning?

18:52.348 --> 18:53.828
- Thanks, man.

18:53.871 --> 18:54.785
- Hi, Gunnar.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.179
- Killer show.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.833
- Amazing.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.749
Steve saw you in the audience.
He wants to say hello to you.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.316
Seriously?
- Yeah.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.317
He wants to talk to you.
- No, you'’re kidding.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.492
- Come on.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.058
- Let'’s go.
- All right.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.451
- You know, a lot of
people would love

19:08.495 --> 19:10.018
to be sitting where you
are right about now.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.368
Drinking champagne
with one of the most

19:12.412 --> 19:14.022
influential men in
the music industry?

19:14.065 --> 19:17.591
- Well, okay, if
you wanna put it like that.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.070
- Well, yeah.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.811
I mean, I'’m just
a little girl from Oregon.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.073
- You'’re a little girl.

19:22.117 --> 19:25.947
You'’re sweet.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.863
Don'’t go there, Brad.
Hello? Do not go there.

19:32.432 --> 19:36.740
- I feel like a teenager.

19:36.784 --> 19:40.527
I really think I might be
falling for you.

19:40.570 --> 19:43.182
Fall for each other?

19:47.055 --> 19:50.450
- I cannot figure you out.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.452
Maybe that'’s what
I like about you.

19:52.495 --> 19:57.239
- I will not be a part of
breaking up your marriage.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.286
- It'’s already a done deal.
See?

20:08.598 --> 20:11.427
- I saw you at
Charlie Mae'’s a while back.

20:11.471 --> 20:12.776
And you were great.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.778
You were there?
- Yeah.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.389
Well, I mean, I like your work.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.261
I like the way you
hold something back.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.785
Like you'’re keeping
a secret or something.

20:21.829 --> 20:22.873
I wish I could do that.

20:24.701 --> 20:27.051
- My secret is, I'’m not
always sure what I'’m doing.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.445
- Well, we are all flying
by the seat of our pants.

20:29.489 --> 20:30.794
- Not you, man.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.622
You'’re the most talented
musician I know.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.798
You never quit.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.671
This is the only thing I know
how to do besides fly fishing.

20:37.714 --> 20:41.283
- You always deliver.
Man, I wish I could do that.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.286
- So what are
we trying to say here?

20:44.330 --> 20:46.506
- All right.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.248
I'’m blocked.
I'’m always in my head.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.032
- Just try taking your
head off

20:51.075 --> 20:53.252
and putting it up on
a shelf for a while.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.167
- I don'’t know.

20:56.211 --> 20:59.083
Throw the pieces up
and see where they land.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.738
- Yeah. I can never
seem to do that.

21:01.782 --> 21:07.614
- Then try not being
Gunnar Scott for a change.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.270
Scare yourself.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.274
See you around.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.279
- You all know how
I'’ve called out

21:20.322 --> 21:22.324
The Movement for
Coherent Philosophy

21:22.368 --> 21:25.371
for its inhumane treatment
of its volunteers.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.287
And in response, they'’ve used
my past struggles

21:28.330 --> 21:31.420
in an attempt to discredit
what I'’ve had to say.

21:31.464 --> 21:34.902
Well, today I have here with me
two people who can personally

21:34.945 --> 21:36.991
attest to the cruelties
that have occurred...

21:37.034 --> 21:38.384
- Miss Barnes, does that mean...

21:38.427 --> 21:39.994
- I will pursue this for as
long as it takes

21:40.037 --> 21:42.475
to expose the true nature
of this organization.

21:42.518 --> 21:46.392
But I also have
an announcement to make.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.437
I'’m officially leaving
the music industry

21:48.481 --> 21:50.439
and retiring
from the public eye.

21:52.702 --> 21:55.139
It is ironic that
Darius Enright was the person

21:55.183 --> 21:57.751
who taught me that fame
and celebrity can come

21:57.794 --> 21:59.666
with a very toxic price.

21:59.709 --> 22:03.670
Darius, wherever you are,
you can'’t hide from me.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.803
I will never stop fighting
until justice prevails.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.681
- All right, damn it!

22:14.724 --> 22:16.509
I'’ve had it with you.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.444
- Hey.

22:38.487 --> 22:39.401
- Hey.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.536
How'’s Juliette?

22:43.579 --> 22:45.407
- Well, that'’s anybody's guess.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.410
- You'’ll figure it out.

22:50.325 --> 22:51.370
- Come on, Avery.

22:53.241 --> 22:56.940
- I'’m telling you, I can't
deal with her anymore.

22:56.984 --> 23:00.379
I mean, she'’s always been half
gone even when she'’s with me.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.427
- I still think
you need more time.

23:05.471 --> 23:09.866
- Alannah, don'’t you understand
that this is about you now?

23:09.910 --> 23:14.001
I mean, unless you'’re starting
to like Brad Maitland instead.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.177
- You can'’t actually
believe that!

23:16.220 --> 23:20.181
- No, of course not.
It'’s just I don't trust him.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.965
- It doesn'’t matter anyway.

23:26.492 --> 23:30.800
- You'’re an incredibly
sweet person

23:30.844 --> 23:36.458
and we met at the absolute
perfect wrong time.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.373
- Alannah, don'’t do this.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.789
- We just might be
able to pull this off.

24:02.832 --> 24:06.532
That'’s if everyone shows up and
the auction items are a hit.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.795
- I got a good feeling.
Don'’t worry.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.666
- Oh, hey, there.
- Hi.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.363
- Oh, look at
that little sweetie!

24:12.407 --> 24:15.062
- Hey.
Come here, cowboy.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.498
- He'’s excited to see you.

24:19.545 --> 24:20.589
Mind if I take him a bit?

24:20.633 --> 24:22.504
- Sure. I'’ll be here.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.332
- I'’ll be down at the stables.

24:26.639 --> 24:29.250
- I don'’t even know.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.295
- Oh, I'’m sorry.
I know it'’s been rough.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.515
He'’s come such a long way.

24:33.559 --> 24:36.387
- Thanks to you.
- It wasn'’t me. Gosh.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.041
- Yeah, it was.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.695
I tried for so long
to help Sean get rid

24:39.739 --> 24:43.351
of some of his pain.
But I failed.

24:43.394 --> 24:47.486
- No. No, you didn'’t.
Y'’all went through hell.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.532
I think that'’s
what led you guys here.

24:50.576 --> 24:51.925
- It led to you.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.189
- You just waltzed right in

24:55.232 --> 24:57.365
and suddenly now he has
something to live for.

24:57.408 --> 25:00.499
- Angela, he loves
you so much.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.326
- Maybe.

25:02.370 --> 25:07.331
Sometimes I think
he'’d be better off with you.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.564
- Hey.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.435
- Apologizing.

25:24.479 --> 25:27.308
- It'’s okay. I'm sorry
for calling you pathetic.

25:27.351 --> 25:30.529
- I told him.

25:32.139 --> 25:35.446
- That I told you
where he was that night.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.971
- Wow. Good for you.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.625
And what did he say?

25:39.668 --> 25:41.801
Not that I care.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.891
- He was furious that
I would betray him like that.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.548
- Well, that'’s it.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.593
Yeah, that'’s it.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.378
I mean, did
he not fire you or...

25:54.422 --> 25:57.033
- No. No, he just, he kind
of accepted it.

25:57.077 --> 26:00.254
It was weird.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.212
Did you tell him
you were done?

26:02.256 --> 26:05.476
- Not exactly.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.521
Um...

26:08.697 --> 26:10.569
- Come on.

26:10.612 --> 26:13.093
Hey, I'’m from
outer space, remember?

26:13.136 --> 26:14.703
Please don'’t judge me.

26:14.747 --> 26:19.578
- I'’m not judging you.
I feel sad for you.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.231
- It'’s like the worst
kind of judgment.

26:21.275 --> 26:22.972
- What would you like me
to tell you?

26:28.195 --> 26:30.458
- I don'’t know.
I'’m gonna go.

26:30.501 --> 26:31.981
- Okay.

26:34.767 --> 26:37.639
Did you ever think about
what might have happened

26:37.683 --> 26:39.467
if you had never met him?

26:39.510 --> 26:42.731
- Yeah, I do.
I'’d have nothing.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.623
- Yeah.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.276
- Well, how in the world...

27:06.320 --> 27:08.191
- I don'’t even know, man.
I went a little nuts.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.497
- I can'’t believe it!

27:09.540 --> 27:11.368
- Well, don'’t be
too amazed, but...

27:11.412 --> 27:14.763
- No, no. I'’m happy for you
and I'’m excited, you know.

27:14.807 --> 27:17.548
You know, you can'’t be you when
you perform this song, right?

27:19.681 --> 27:21.030
- Well, it'’s like you've tapped
into like a whole '’nother thing.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.729
Like a whole
other you, you know.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.469
It'’s wild.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.211
- Yeah. I mean,
maybe I should be you.

27:28.255 --> 27:31.780
- What do you mean...
- Well, you should be me.

27:31.824 --> 27:35.349
I'’m saying like from now on,
you should be me onstage.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.656
Okay, let me show you.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.266
Like that little riff that...

27:42.443 --> 27:44.924
Right? So...

27:51.234 --> 27:53.584
- Yeah, I can'’t do that.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.021
- That'’s the point, man.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.544
You have to.

27:59.025 --> 27:59.982
Now help me up.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.857
- Yeah. I was surprised
to get your call.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.815
- Well, I just wanted
to check in on you.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.383
You know, see how you'’re doing.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.037
How you doing?

28:11.080 --> 28:15.215
- I'’m good, thanks.
- Well, good.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.347
I really wanted to make
sure that Shiny New

28:17.391 --> 28:21.917
was doing right by you.
You deserve that.

28:21.961 --> 28:24.224
Also, I know a little bit
about how Brad can be.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.617
So how'’s Brad being?

28:26.661 --> 28:28.054
- That'’s nothing
I can'’t handle.

28:30.534 --> 28:31.710
- Okay.

28:35.583 --> 28:36.497
What?

28:40.893 --> 28:42.764
Something I'’m missing here?

28:45.854 --> 28:47.247
- Of course, you can.

29:05.918 --> 29:09.051
- All right! Let'’s do this!

29:09.095 --> 29:10.270
Woo!
You guys ready for this?

29:10.313 --> 29:12.054
- This tour'’s gonna be sick!

29:12.098 --> 29:14.361
- Oh, absolutely.
- Frickin'’ sick!

29:14.404 --> 29:16.058
- Come on, grab the bags.
Put '’em in.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.451
Twig, grab the bags.

29:19.453 --> 29:20.802
- I'’m not gonna go.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.417
- No. You heard what I said.

29:27.461 --> 29:28.723
Come on, Twig.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.507
- No, I think...

29:30.551 --> 29:33.075
Yeah, I think I'’m done
being your bitch.

29:33.119 --> 29:34.511
- Whoa!

29:37.471 --> 29:39.560
- Well, you'’re gonna be if you
don'’t put those bags in the car.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.088
Okay, okay, great, great.
You know what?

29:46.132 --> 29:47.394
You'’re nothing but a loser,
you know that?

29:47.437 --> 29:48.917
- Okay.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.745
Grab the bags!

29:50.789 --> 29:53.879
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.576
- Big mistake.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.926
- Maybe.

29:57.970 --> 30:00.146
- Well, good job, Twig.
Congrats.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.887
You just walked away
from the best thing

30:01.930 --> 30:03.627
that ever happened to you.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.064
- See ya, man.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.894
Okay, great!
Have a nice life!

30:08.937 --> 30:11.461
Enjoy working at
Piggly Wiggly, coffee boy!

30:13.159 --> 30:14.508
Yeah, you'’re nothing
but a loser!

30:14.551 --> 30:16.075
You know that?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.211
- Hey.
- Hey, thanks for coming.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.605
- Yeah. I know, I came
as soon as I could.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.737
Hi, sweetie.
- One minute, she'’s all right.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.261
Then the next,
she'’s lethargic.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.002
I took her temperature
an hour ago

30:30.045 --> 30:31.220
and it was 101.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.048
- Yeah, she'’s definitely warm.

30:33.092 --> 30:35.007
Let'’s take her temperature.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.660
- Yep.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.184
- You'’re gonna be
all right, baby.

30:38.227 --> 30:39.794
- Here.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.274
- You know how to do this,
under your tongue.

30:41.317 --> 30:44.799
- There you go, baby.

30:44.843 --> 30:49.195
I saw your press conference.

30:49.238 --> 30:52.067
Did you mean it?
About leaving the business?

30:52.111 --> 30:54.330
- I'’ve never meant
anything more in my life.

30:55.984 --> 30:59.161
- You never cease to amaze me.

30:59.205 --> 31:04.427
- I'’m finally going to get to do
what I'’ve always wanted to do.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.386
I never told you this, but...

31:06.429 --> 31:08.954
I bought a house
outside Nashville.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.825
- Of course, you did.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.523
- It'’s more like a farm.
It'’s beautiful.

31:17.092 --> 31:19.399
104.

31:19.442 --> 31:21.444
- It'’s 104!

31:21.488 --> 31:23.838
- Oh, my God!
- She'’s burning up!

31:23.882 --> 31:25.840
- We should call 911.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.624
- No. Let'’s just take her!
Let'’s take her ourselves.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.017
- Yeah.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.192
- Come here. Come here, honey.
Come here.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.586
- Go with daddy.
I got it all.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.153
- Okay, okay, come on.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.693
- It'’s okay, baby.
You'’re gonna be all right.

31:54.782 --> 31:57.567
- Somebody help!
- She has 104 temperature!

31:57.611 --> 31:59.482
- She'’s burning up!

32:10.319 --> 32:12.321
- Yes, she is.

32:12.365 --> 32:13.366
Caught it just in time.

32:14.802 --> 32:17.022
- Pneumonia.
She'’s also dehydrated.

32:17.065 --> 32:19.241
So we'’re giving her fluids
along with antibiotics.

32:19.285 --> 32:22.462
- Thank God,
she'’s gonna be okay.

32:22.505 --> 32:23.898
- Thank you so much, doctor.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.204
- Yeah, thank you.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.683
- It'’s my pleasure.

32:31.036 --> 32:36.302
- Well, you definitely have my
permission to say I told you so.

32:36.345 --> 32:39.174
- I don'’t need your
permission to say that.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.567
- That'’s true.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.700
- Poor baby.

32:43.744 --> 32:48.401
- She'’s gonna be okay,
thank God.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.969
We'’ve been through
a lot, haven'’t we?

32:56.496 --> 32:58.411
- Why is it when you
smile at me that way,

32:58.454 --> 32:59.890
all the pain disappears?

33:10.684 --> 33:12.381
- I don'’t know.

33:14.731 --> 33:18.735
- You know,
I'’m not upset, really.

33:18.779 --> 33:21.173
For all that you knew,
I was never coming back.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.610
So I totally understand.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.055

- Well, I mean us.

37:52.313 --> 37:55.011
- Yeah.

37:55.055 --> 37:58.058
You broke into my heart
like some sort of wild angel.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.712
You busted open the doors.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.932

38:02.976 --> 38:05.021
- You'’re beautiful.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.762
You don'’t even know what
I see when I just look at you.

not with me anyway.

She'’s here.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.533
She'’s the love of your life,
and she'’s leaving.

38:38.577 --> 38:39.795
- Scarlett, you'’re just...

38:41.231 --> 38:43.103
She'’s the one
who kept you alive.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.844
You think I'’m a good idea
because you ain'’t been

38:44.887 --> 38:46.672
through hell with me.

38:46.715 --> 38:47.673
And you sure as heck ain'’t
seen me at my worst.

38:47.716 --> 38:50.110
So just...

38:50.153 --> 38:51.764
- I would have liked to.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.159
- Thank you.

38:59.162 --> 39:01.991
She'’s real, okay?

39:02.035 --> 39:03.950
She knows you, she loves
you through and through.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.299
And she'’s leaving right now.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.605
And if you don'’t get
after her,

39:06.648 --> 39:08.215
you'’re not gonna
get another chance.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.088
You gotta go, Sean.

39:18.834 --> 39:19.792
Go.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.446
- I'’ll never forget you.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.883
- Go.

39:23.926 --> 39:24.971
Go.

39:35.982 --> 39:37.853
- That was really
something, wasn'’t it?

39:37.897 --> 39:39.725
- I'’m so glad I got to see that.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.248
- Yeah, me too, Dad.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.684
- That auction
was so killer, wasn'’t it?

39:44.338 --> 39:46.819
- That'’s what we need.
We need another guitar!

39:46.862 --> 39:47.820
- Yes, we do.

39:49.343 --> 39:50.475
- I was born at night,
but not last night.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.304
- Okay. Hey, Daph, you
wanna go with granddad?

40:01.181 --> 40:02.400
Let her ride with you.

40:02.443 --> 40:06.099
I'’ve got some errands to run.

40:06.142 --> 40:08.406
I'’m gonna be a while.

41:20.956 --> 41:23.524
- I knew it.

41:23.568 --> 41:24.960
I knew you were lying to me.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.398
Do you hear me?

41:28.442 --> 41:30.749
I know that you lied!
Son of a bitch!

41:30.792 --> 41:31.750
You lied!

41:31.793 --> 41:33.578
- Dad!

41:37.407 --> 41:38.974
- Get outta my sight.
- Son...

41:39.018 --> 41:41.237
- Get outta here. Go. Go!

41:41.281 --> 41:43.588
I don'’t want you here!
You understand me?

41:46.329 --> 41:47.896
You'’re not my father.

41:50.595 --> 41:54.120
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
