WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.917
For more than 3,000 years

00:04.042 --> 00:05.708
Ireland has maintained

00:05.875 --> 00:07.500
a connection to ancient magic

00:07.667 --> 00:09.542
and a mystical realm.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.875
DIARMUID JOHNSON:
We have two parallel worlds,

00:12.042 --> 00:14.667
the human world
and the otherworld.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.125
NARRATOR:
The rolling landscape

00:16.250 --> 00:19.958
is believed
to possess hidden power.

00:20.042 --> 00:21.750
ANDREW COLLINS:
It is said that

00:21.875 --> 00:24.708
the mounds acted as these

00:24.875 --> 00:27.375
doorways into other realities.

00:28.375 --> 00:30.208
NARRATOR:
And within these earthen mounds

00:30.375 --> 00:31.708
are said to be powerful beings

00:31.875 --> 00:34.375
known as the Shining Ones.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.000
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
They are somehow able

00:36.167 --> 00:39.000
to manipulate
their surroundings,

00:39.167 --> 00:42.500
and have the knowledge
of the universe.

00:42.667 --> 00:47.500
NARRATOR:
Are these Irish legends
more than fanciful mythology?

00:47.583 --> 00:50.250
And if so, could there be

00:50.375 --> 00:52.792
an extraterrestrial connection?

00:52.917 --> 00:55.458
WILLIAM HENRY:
The ancient Irish
were saying that these beings

00:55.583 --> 00:56.542
came from the sky.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.417
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:01.542 --> 01:04.167
in the universe.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.292
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:08.542 --> 01:11.208
It demands
we question everything

01:11.333 --> 01:13.625
we have ever been taught.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.750
The evidence is all around us.

01:16.875 --> 01:20.958
The future
is right before our eyes.

01:21.042 --> 01:23.792
We are not alone.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.125
We have never been alone.

01:36.542 --> 01:38.250
NARRATOR:
Ireland.

01:38.375 --> 01:41.500
This lush, green island
in the North Atlantic

01:41.667 --> 01:44.750
has a history of human activity
dating back

01:44.875 --> 01:47.458
more than 33,000 years.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.167
Numerous cultures
have called Ireland home,

01:51.333 --> 01:53.083
from the early Beaker people

01:53.208 --> 01:55.958
to the Celts and the Gaels,

01:56.042 --> 01:58.042
and the island
has a rich tradition

01:58.208 --> 02:02.208
of folklore that has spread
throughout the world.

02:03.292 --> 02:06.333
But perhaps most notable
is that Ireland boasts

02:06.417 --> 02:09.000
some of the oldest
structures on the planet.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.875
Massive earthen mounds,

02:12.000 --> 02:13.542
many of which date back

02:13.667 --> 02:15.875
more than 5,000 years.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.167
TOK THOMPSON:
These mounds are constructed.
They're not natural hills.

02:18.292 --> 02:19.708
These are
megalithic constructions,

02:19.875 --> 02:23.208
um, involving, in the larger
sites, an enormous

02:23.333 --> 02:25.417
amount of man hours and labor.

02:26.875 --> 02:29.917
These would've been,
when they were made, just very,

02:30.042 --> 02:31.708
very impressive sites.

02:31.875 --> 02:35.875
DAVID CHILDRESS:
These mounds were
an ancient earthwork

02:36.042 --> 02:39.167
that had a tunnel
going through it

02:39.333 --> 02:42.208
with stones on either side
and stones on top

02:42.333 --> 02:44.375
and then covered with earth.

02:45.667 --> 02:48.000
THOMPSON:
Ireland has a tremendous
amount of these mounds,

02:48.167 --> 02:50.250
and these are
some of mankind's oldest

02:50.375 --> 02:52.000
large structures in the world.

02:52.167 --> 02:55.167
And they anchor
all of the land together.

02:55.250 --> 02:56.833
Usually, if you visit one on top

02:57.000 --> 02:58.333
of a hill, you go up,
you find one,

02:58.417 --> 03:00.125
and you can do a line
of sight to the next one.

03:00.208 --> 03:02.458
There was almost a network,
almost across

03:02.542 --> 03:06.125
the entire island
of these sites.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.333
NARRATOR:
The oldest known writing
in Ireland

03:09.458 --> 03:12.167
dates to the 6th century A.D.,

03:12.250 --> 03:15.875
more than 3,000 years
after the ancient mounds

03:16.000 --> 03:17.750
are believed to have been built.

03:17.875 --> 03:21.083
With no written record
about the mounds' construction,

03:21.208 --> 03:25.000
archaeologists and historians
can only speculate

03:25.125 --> 03:28.917
as to who made them
and for what purpose.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.542
THOMPSON:
These things were built to go
inside, where, presumably,

03:31.667 --> 03:33.417
very, very important rituals
took place.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.792
We don't know,
but much later on,

03:35.917 --> 03:38.542
these sites would've been
used for gatherings,

03:38.667 --> 03:41.708
for rituals, and sort of
keeping the society together.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.833
These were enormously
long-lived sites

03:45.917 --> 03:47.208
of cultural importance.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.417
It was enormously
long-lived societies

03:49.542 --> 03:51.250
that used these as focal points.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.125
NARRATOR:
30 miles north of Dublin

03:54.208 --> 03:56.000
in County Meath is Ireland's

03:56.167 --> 03:59.750
largest and oldest mound,
called Newgrange.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.208
The ancient structure

04:02.375 --> 04:05.667
consists of over
200,000 tons of stone

04:05.833 --> 04:09.333
and has a passageway leading
to a central chamber

04:09.500 --> 04:11.875
in which human bone fragments
have been found.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.667
But archaeologists
say Newgrange also has

04:15.792 --> 04:19.292
an undeniable connection
to the cosmos.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.208
Spiral petroglyphs, thought
to symbolize the universe,

04:23.333 --> 04:25.333
are found all around it,

04:25.458 --> 04:27.292
and the passageway and chamber

04:27.417 --> 04:30.500
form a cruciform shape
that researchers believe

04:30.583 --> 04:34.250
is based on
the constellation Cygnus.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.417
THOMPSON:
At the time Newgrange was built,

04:36.542 --> 04:39.333
it was presumed to be
the largest structure that

04:39.417 --> 04:41.250
mankind had
ever built in the world.

04:42.708 --> 04:45.083
Now, one of the most interesting
things about Newgrange

04:45.208 --> 04:47.167
is it's a celestial alignment.

04:47.292 --> 04:48.333
This is still
very, very popular.

04:48.417 --> 04:50.042
If you go at
the winter solstice,

04:50.208 --> 04:53.333
you have the sun dagger that
it cuts tremendous distance

04:53.458 --> 04:56.458
all the way in to brighten up
the inner chamber.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.125
NARRATOR:
Newgrange is unique
among Ireland's mounds

05:00.208 --> 05:03.125
in its sophistication,
and was clearly designed

05:03.250 --> 05:05.250
for ritualistic activity.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.667
But according
to ancient Irish texts,

05:08.792 --> 05:12.667
the mounds serve a more profound
and mysterious purpose,

05:12.792 --> 05:16.875
as the dwelling places
of otherworldly beings

05:17.042 --> 05:20.417
traditionally called the sidhe.

05:20.542 --> 05:23.125
DR. JENNY BUTLER:
The word "sidhe,"
it can mean "the mounds"

05:23.250 --> 05:24.417
and also

05:24.542 --> 05:27.167
can mean "the otherworld people,

05:27.292 --> 05:29.667
the people of the mounds."

05:29.833 --> 05:31.708
In Irish tradition,

05:31.833 --> 05:35.625
it's bad luck to use
the word "sidhe"

05:35.708 --> 05:39.083
to directly refer to these
otherworld people.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.333
So, there are many
different names.

05:41.458 --> 05:45.667
We have the English word
fairy folk, also elves.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.583
NARRATOR:
Stories of fairies, elves,

05:48.708 --> 05:51.000
and even leprechauns are rooted

05:51.125 --> 05:54.583
in the ancient folklore of what
the Irish called the sidhe.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.833
But for many Irish people,

05:56.958 --> 06:00.958
the sidhe are not merely
mythological figures.

06:01.042 --> 06:04.000
MARTY MULLIGAN:
Fairies and leprechauns
and all that sort of stuff,

06:04.167 --> 06:05.333
like, too many people kind of

06:05.500 --> 06:06.833
laugh and joke about it
at times,

06:06.917 --> 06:08.625
but it's knowledge that'd been
passed down for

06:08.708 --> 06:10.208
thousands and thousands
of years.

06:10.375 --> 06:12.500
JOHNSON:
We have the terrestrial world

06:12.583 --> 06:13.917
and the subterrestrial world,

06:14.042 --> 06:18.042
the human world, and the
superhuman or otherworld.

06:18.208 --> 06:20.875
These worlds exist in parallel.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.500
Occasionally, however,
there is communication

06:23.583 --> 06:25.500
between the two worlds.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.667
NARRATOR:
The mounds are often referred to

06:28.792 --> 06:30.250
as "fairy forts,"

06:30.375 --> 06:32.875
as are stone circles
and tree clusters

06:33.042 --> 06:35.417
that are considered
the property of the sidhe.

06:35.542 --> 06:39.500
This strong cultural belief
that these features

06:39.625 --> 06:42.292
are the domain
of otherworldly beings

06:42.375 --> 06:45.500
has kept them intact
for thousands of years.

06:45.625 --> 06:48.500
And the Irish say that,
when they are disturbed,

06:48.625 --> 06:51.000
bad luck always follows.

06:51.167 --> 06:54.708
MULLIGAN:
SeÃ¡n Quinn was
the wealthiest man in Ireland.

06:54.875 --> 06:58.500
He lost everything
because he moved a fairy fort.

06:58.625 --> 07:02.500
He damaged a fairy fort, and he
moved it to another place.

07:02.625 --> 07:06.583
DeLorean car manufacturers,
they came to Belfast, and were

07:06.708 --> 07:09.500
making the DeLorean car
up in Northern Ireland,

07:09.625 --> 07:12.000
and they built the factory
on the site of a fairy fort.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.542
And it all came crashing down,

07:13.667 --> 07:14.833
and the local people would say,

07:14.917 --> 07:16.750
"Well, you know,
what do you expect?"

07:16.875 --> 07:21.000
Ask any Irish person,
"Would you damage a fairy fort?

07:21.125 --> 07:23.125
What would happen if
you damaged a fairy tree?"

07:23.250 --> 07:26.000
If you gave me ten million bucks

07:26.167 --> 07:28.458
and a Cadillac and a helicopter

07:28.583 --> 07:32.333
and a beautiful house on
Sunset Boulevard and said

07:32.458 --> 07:34.000
all I had to do was
chop down a fairy tree,

07:34.125 --> 07:35.958
I'd be handing that money
straight back to you.

07:36.042 --> 07:38.375
I wouldn't do it. No one
I know would do it either.

07:38.542 --> 07:42.875
So, do we believe in
the fairies in Ireland? We do.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.917
NARRATOR:
While modern-day
representations of fairies

07:47.042 --> 07:50.167
often depict benevolent,
spritely creatures,

07:50.292 --> 07:53.667
traditional Irish notions
of fairies are much different.

07:53.833 --> 07:56.417
They are considered powerful

07:56.542 --> 07:59.542
and sometimes dangerous beings.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.833
You don't want to mess
with the <i>aos sÃ­.</i>

08:02.958 --> 08:05.417
They're not cute,
cuddly little fairies like

08:05.542 --> 08:07.375
we-we typically think of today.

08:07.500 --> 08:11.167
But these are very
extraordinarily powerful people.

08:11.292 --> 08:13.458
Wielders of supernatural powers.

08:14.542 --> 08:16.500
NARRATOR:
The sidhe, or fairy folk,

08:16.625 --> 08:20.333
are often referred to as
the Shining Ones,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.042
but do accounts
of their luminous

08:22.167 --> 08:25.333
appearance suggest
that they are divine beings?

08:25.500 --> 08:28.833
According to the
ancient Irish stories,

08:28.958 --> 08:31.625
while the fairies have
supernatural abilities,

08:31.750 --> 08:33.917
they are not immortal gods.

08:34.042 --> 08:36.750
The inhabitant of
the sidhe is not necessarily

08:36.875 --> 08:38.833
immortal in the narrative.

08:38.958 --> 08:42.583
Sometimes they're-they're
killed or-or meet with death,

08:42.708 --> 08:44.208
but they never grow old.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.042
And so, if they are
killed or die,

08:47.167 --> 08:48.958
they do so while young.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.292
They're other, uh,
but somewhat humanoid.

08:51.375 --> 08:54.708
Sometimes they're small
and green, they abduct people,

08:54.875 --> 08:57.667
they have, uh, either advanced
technology or ancient magic.

08:57.792 --> 09:02.000
And in many ways
this fairy tradition, uh,

09:02.083 --> 09:04.500
reminds me very much
of the UFO tradition

09:04.583 --> 09:05.875
that we have
in the United States.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
HUGH NEWMAN:
When it comes to these dwellings

09:08.125 --> 09:11.667
of the fairy folk,
there's lots of talk about

09:11.750 --> 09:14.167
otherworldly beings
emerging from the mounds.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.333
And also people getting taken
into the mounds

09:18.500 --> 09:20.000
and, like, disappearing.

09:21.167 --> 09:23.875
TSOUKALOS:
You hear stories
of lights in the sky

09:24.000 --> 09:27.500
or even lights in the forest
and the woods that you see.

09:27.625 --> 09:30.167
So, could it be possible

09:30.333 --> 09:32.500
that the fairy folk

09:32.625 --> 09:34.708
is a description of

09:34.875 --> 09:36.833
extraterrestrials
back in the day?

09:36.958 --> 09:39.667
There is absolutely an argument

09:39.792 --> 09:42.500
that can make that case.

09:42.667 --> 09:46.750
MULLIGAN:
In our stories
relating to the sidhe,

09:46.875 --> 09:48.667
the fairies,
call them what you will,

09:48.792 --> 09:51.333
all of our stories say that
they came from the sky world.

09:51.458 --> 09:55.083
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that
modern beliefs of fairies

09:55.208 --> 09:59.042
and elves are based on
real otherworldly beings

09:59.167 --> 10:01.917
that the Irish people
encountered centuries ago

10:02.042 --> 10:05.458
and that may still
inhabit the island today?

10:05.583 --> 10:08.333
And if so,
why are they thought to

10:08.417 --> 10:10.417
dwell within the ancient mounds?

10:10.542 --> 10:13.667
According to legend,
the sidhe did not always

10:13.833 --> 10:15.792
live within the Earth,

10:15.917 --> 10:19.625
and their story begins
with a group of shining beings

10:19.708 --> 10:22.125
who arrived in flying craft.

10:28.917 --> 10:32.292
NARRATOR: In Ireland, tales of
the sidhe, or fairy folk,

10:32.375 --> 10:36.208
have been passed down orally
for more than 3,000 years,

10:36.333 --> 10:39.750
and in the 11th century,
many of these stories were

10:39.875 --> 10:43.000
documented in a text called
<i>The Book of Invasions.</i>

10:43.083 --> 10:45.833
According to this medieval
account of Irish history

10:45.917 --> 10:48.750
and lore,
thousands of years ago,

10:48.875 --> 10:51.000
a godlike race of beings called

10:51.083 --> 10:55.167
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann landed
on a mountaintop in Ireland.

10:56.208 --> 10:59.042
Often referred to
as the Shining Ones,

10:59.167 --> 11:01.875
they are
the ancestors of the sidhe.

11:02.042 --> 11:04.292
MULLIGAN:
All of our stories relate back
to the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.

11:04.375 --> 11:08.250
For 3000 years, at least,
if not more before that, all of

11:08.375 --> 11:11.292
the stories from mythology are
all related to Tuatha DÃ© Danann.

11:11.375 --> 11:12.750
They were the Shining Ones.

11:14.292 --> 11:17.750
BUTLER:
There is a description
in the mythological material

11:17.875 --> 11:19.417
in the early Irish literature

11:19.542 --> 11:21.500
of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann

11:21.625 --> 11:24.417
arriving in, uh, cloud ships,

11:24.542 --> 11:27.417
arriving in dark clouds

11:27.542 --> 11:31.000
and landing on a mountain.

11:32.375 --> 11:35.000
KATHLEEN McGOWAN:
There was a long poem
about the arrival of

11:35.125 --> 11:37.625
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.
One of the lines says,

11:37.750 --> 11:40.875
"The truth was not known
beneath the sky of stars,

11:41.042 --> 11:43.208
whether they were
of heaven or of earth."

11:44.333 --> 11:46.417
JOHNSON:
The Tuatha DÃ© Danann
are not human.

11:46.542 --> 11:49.875
They're demigods.
And not immortal,

11:50.042 --> 11:52.875
not infallible, um,
not like the gods of

11:53.042 --> 11:56.208
monotheistic tradition of any
of the Abrahamic religions.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.333
NARRATOR:
The Tuatha DÃ© Danann
were said to be luminous

12:00.458 --> 12:04.875
beings of large stature
who wielded magical powers.

12:05.042 --> 12:07.792
The Tuatha DÃ© Danann
had an arsenal of very

12:07.917 --> 12:10.250
technological sounding weaponry.

12:10.375 --> 12:14.167
Lugh of the Long Arm,
for example, possessed a spear

12:14.333 --> 12:16.875
that, when he threw it,
he could give a voice command,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.167
and it would automatically
hit whatever target.

12:19.292 --> 12:21.167
Then he'd give
another voice command,

12:21.333 --> 12:23.833
and the spear would
mysteriously return to him.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.833
We have circles of light
that they used to

12:26.958 --> 12:29.500
travel around Ireland upon.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.208
We have another chieftain
named Nuada

12:32.333 --> 12:35.167
who lost an arm in a battle
against the giants,

12:35.292 --> 12:38.833
and they were able
to replace his arm.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.708
CHILDRESS:
The Tuatha DÃ© Danann
were said to have

12:40.875 --> 12:42.333
a magical cauldron.

12:42.458 --> 12:45.083
They had a cloak
of invisibility.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.417
They had spears

12:47.542 --> 12:51.000
that shot flames out.

12:51.167 --> 12:52.583
TSOUKALOS:
The ancient astronaut theory

12:52.708 --> 12:55.833
tries to look at ancient stories

12:56.000 --> 12:59.167
in which magic happens

12:59.333 --> 13:01.917
from a modern perspective
and determine

13:02.042 --> 13:04.167
if that so-called magic

13:04.292 --> 13:07.375
really was some type
of technology.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.000
Then one has to wonder, where
did that technology come from?

13:11.125 --> 13:13.583
Well, uh, there's only
one answer to this,

13:13.708 --> 13:16.083
and that is extraterrestrials.

13:17.042 --> 13:18.917
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

13:19.042 --> 13:20.708
another intriguing aspect

13:20.833 --> 13:23.333
of these stories
is how similar they are

13:23.500 --> 13:27.333
to accounts of sky gods found
in other ancient cultures.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.500
The stories of--

13:30.625 --> 13:32.750
let's call them aliens--

13:32.875 --> 13:36.250
descending from clouds
on tops of mountains

13:36.375 --> 13:40.292
are straight across the cultural
history of, uh, human beings.

13:40.417 --> 13:43.333
Let's start with one
of the earliest ones.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.333
The descent on Mount Hermon

13:45.500 --> 13:47.000
in the Golan Heights.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.208
That's where
the Nephilim came down.

13:49.333 --> 13:52.792
Another,
in the descent of the Anunnaki,

13:52.875 --> 13:54.833
they came from clouds.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.917
CHILDRESS:
We have other stories
in Tibet and other places

13:59.042 --> 14:00.833
where these gods
are coming down,

14:00.958 --> 14:04.000
and they land
on top of a mountain.

14:04.083 --> 14:08.458
The gods of Olympus in Greece
is another example.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.667
COLLINS:
The stories of the
Tuatha DÃ© Danann

14:12.792 --> 14:15.000
in these whirlwinds or clouds

14:15.167 --> 14:17.375
is something that we find
in connection

14:17.500 --> 14:20.292
with deities
in other parts of the world.

14:20.375 --> 14:23.083
For instance,
across the Middle East,

14:23.208 --> 14:25.583
there is the concept of djinn.

14:26.750 --> 14:29.292
These are supernatural beings,

14:29.417 --> 14:32.667
very often associated
with fire and light,

14:32.792 --> 14:35.833
that can appear in whirlwinds

14:36.000 --> 14:39.625
and manifest into physical form.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.208
TSOUKALOS:
The fact that we have
countless stories

14:42.333 --> 14:44.542
that are not just similar,
but identical,

14:44.708 --> 14:46.917
leads me to think that

14:47.042 --> 14:50.083
perhaps all these ancient
cultures were visited

14:50.208 --> 14:52.083
by the same extraterrestrials.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.458
NARRATOR:
According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

14:56.542 --> 14:59.833
the tradition that is most
similar to the Tuatha DÃ© Danann

14:59.958 --> 15:02.208
is that of the Anunnaki,

15:02.333 --> 15:05.417
the sky gods described
by the Sumerians,

15:05.542 --> 15:09.000
humankind's earliest
known civilization.

15:09.083 --> 15:11.167
AMIR HUSSAIN:
What you've got with
the Sumerians is

15:11.292 --> 15:13.625
the beginnings
of-of civilization,

15:13.750 --> 15:16.333
people living together, but also
the beginnings of writing.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.167
You know, it's some
of the earliest written

15:18.333 --> 15:20.667
texts that we have
are texts by these people.

15:20.792 --> 15:23.333
JONATHAN YOUNG:
These clay tablets are

15:23.458 --> 15:26.708
5,000 years old
and more, and they

15:26.875 --> 15:29.167
tell of the arrival of the gods,
the Anunnaki,

15:29.250 --> 15:31.667
the pantheon of gods.
The chief was Anu.

15:31.792 --> 15:34.792
This is the sky god
who came along

15:34.875 --> 15:37.125
and created everything.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.333
TSOUKALOS:
The term Anunnaki means

15:39.417 --> 15:42.500
"those who from
the heavens came,"

15:42.625 --> 15:46.333
and it refers to beings
descending from the sky,

15:46.458 --> 15:48.167
imparting knowledge.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.417
NARRATOR:
In the Irish stories,

15:50.542 --> 15:53.000
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann
were also responsible

15:53.167 --> 15:56.125
for imparting knowledge
to the ancient people.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.667
MULLIGAN:
Tuatha DÃ© Danann

15:57.833 --> 15:58.917
were the masters
of all of the crafts,

15:59.042 --> 16:00.875
masters of all of the arts,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.167
and they introduced
the knowledge

16:02.250 --> 16:04.000
in the ways of agriculture.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.667
Tuatha DÃ© Danann would always
interact with the people.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.458
It's the same as the Anunnaki.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.167
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

16:11.292 --> 16:14.083
the iconography
of the Sumerians and Irish

16:14.208 --> 16:16.125
provides additional evidence

16:16.208 --> 16:20.000
that they encountered
the same otherworldly beings.

16:20.125 --> 16:23.875
Both depicted the gods
as being of giant stature

16:24.000 --> 16:25.792
compared to humans,

16:25.875 --> 16:30.083
both portrayed them in scenes
with hybrid or flying animals,

16:30.208 --> 16:32.583
and both have images of the gods

16:32.708 --> 16:36.500
with horns or antlers
emerging from their heads.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
But perhaps
most intriguing of all

16:40.083 --> 16:43.042
is that there appears to be
a linguistic connection

16:43.208 --> 16:46.958
between the Anunnaki
and the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.

16:47.042 --> 16:48.375
According to some accounts,

16:48.500 --> 16:50.333
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann's
original name

16:50.500 --> 16:52.500
was the Tuatha Danu.

16:52.625 --> 16:55.792
"The Tribe of Anu," or Danu.

16:55.917 --> 16:58.375
Linguists are
very intrigued by this

16:58.500 --> 17:01.500
because this encodes
the name of Anu,

17:01.583 --> 17:06.167
the high god of the Anunnaki,
for whom they are formed,

17:06.333 --> 17:09.417
and it suggests that perhaps
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann

17:09.542 --> 17:12.042
are the descendants
of the Anunnaki.

17:12.167 --> 17:16.500
NARRATOR:
Could the striking similarities
that exist between the stories

17:16.583 --> 17:19.500
of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann
and the Anunnaki

17:19.583 --> 17:24.083
reveal that Ireland was visited
by the same otherworldly beings

17:24.208 --> 17:27.917
that are described by humanity's
first known civilization

17:28.042 --> 17:31.000
roughly 3,000 miles away?

17:31.917 --> 17:33.625
But if so,

17:33.708 --> 17:36.792
how are they connected
to Ireland's mound dwellers,

17:36.917 --> 17:39.333
known as the sidhe,
or fairy folk?

17:39.500 --> 17:43.167
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

17:43.333 --> 17:47.292
mysterious ancient priests
called the druids.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.167
NARRATOR:
Kent, England

17:54.708 --> 17:56.583
1988.

17:56.708 --> 18:00.958
During an excavation
of an Iron Age burial site,

18:01.042 --> 18:04.208
archaeologists uncover
the skeleton of a man

18:04.375 --> 18:07.250
who lived around
the third century BC

18:07.375 --> 18:10.417
and who was wearing
a unique headdress.

18:10.542 --> 18:14.167
Based on the design
of this bronze crown,

18:14.292 --> 18:17.083
many researchers believe
these are the first remains

18:17.208 --> 18:20.208
ever discovered of a druid.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.542
According to Irish legend,

18:23.708 --> 18:26.667
the druids were a class
of ancient Celtic priests

18:26.833 --> 18:30.500
who were in close contact
with the Shining Ones,

18:30.667 --> 18:32.333
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.

18:32.458 --> 18:34.667
BUTLER:
The word for "druid" in Irish

18:34.792 --> 18:39.000
is <i>draÃ­ocht,</i>
which literally means "magic."

18:39.125 --> 18:41.167
So there is, uh,
an interconnection

18:41.292 --> 18:43.667
between the Tuatha DÃ© Danann
and their magic

18:43.750 --> 18:45.958
and the practice of druidry.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.333
CHILDRESS:
The Tuatha DÃ© Danann

18:48.417 --> 18:51.542
were said to have been
the founders of druidism.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.500
And the druids were said
to have all kinds

18:53.583 --> 18:56.125
of special powers themselves.

18:56.208 --> 18:59.750
And so, it would seem
that the Tuatha DÃ© Danann

18:59.875 --> 19:04.375
had shown some of their
extraterrestrial technology

19:04.500 --> 19:08.458
to the druids who then
were able to use it themselves.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.667
TSOUKALOS:
The druidic religion originated

19:12.750 --> 19:15.625
with the Tuatha DÃ© Danann,
but they were never allowed

19:15.750 --> 19:19.917
to write down
any of the druidic knowledge.

19:20.042 --> 19:21.500
It was taboo,

19:21.625 --> 19:26.167
because it was so-called
sacred knowledge.

19:26.292 --> 19:29.167
HENRY:
The druids spent
decades in training

19:29.292 --> 19:31.583
to perform
their priestly functions.

19:31.708 --> 19:33.167
These are members

19:33.292 --> 19:35.333
of the inner circle,
as we're told.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.375
The inner circle refers,
ultimately,

19:37.542 --> 19:40.125
to the innermost knowledge
of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann,

19:40.208 --> 19:42.375
the Shining Ones.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.333
They know their secrets and
they can wield their technology.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.333
NARRATOR:
Portrayals of druids
as mysterious,

19:48.500 --> 19:51.375
shaman-like figures
with mystical powers

19:51.500 --> 19:53.417
has led some scholars
to question

19:53.542 --> 19:57.500
if they truly existed or were
purely mythological figures.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.792
But according to the earliest
accounts of them,

20:00.917 --> 20:04.000
the druids were an integral
part of Celtic society

20:04.125 --> 20:06.500
throughout the British Isles.

20:06.625 --> 20:09.083
JOHNSON:
There are certain things
we know about the druids,

20:09.208 --> 20:10.750
but of course there's a lot
we don't know,

20:10.875 --> 20:12.792
and this vacuum incited

20:12.917 --> 20:15.667
a lot of romantic speculation
in the 19th century.

20:15.792 --> 20:18.333
And so, we're still carrying
that baggage a little bit.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.958
The swirling robes and so on.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.958
But in Celtic society,
in Gaelic society,

20:24.083 --> 20:27.292
the druids exercised authority
and played

20:27.375 --> 20:29.208
an important role, uh,

20:29.375 --> 20:31.750
in the life of the tribe
and the society.

20:31.875 --> 20:35.667
The druids were the holders
of knowledge.

20:35.792 --> 20:38.375
They held and perpetuated
the knowledge

20:38.500 --> 20:41.625
which was important
to the survival of the tribe.

20:41.708 --> 20:46.125
They held and perpetuated
judiciary knowledge

20:46.250 --> 20:49.292
and things sacred and spiritual.

20:49.417 --> 20:52.458
THOMPSON:
The druid was
a very special figure,

20:52.542 --> 20:55.125
a priest, perhaps,
a historian, perhaps,

20:55.208 --> 20:58.292
uh, a magician, uh, perhaps,

20:58.375 --> 21:00.167
uh, and many, many things.

21:00.292 --> 21:03.042
These were the learned people
of Celtic society.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.083
They-they formed
a special class.

21:05.208 --> 21:07.000
According to Caesar,
the druids in Gall

21:07.167 --> 21:09.500
had to study 20 years
to become a druid.

21:09.625 --> 21:11.958
And they had many, many roles
to play,

21:12.042 --> 21:17.458
including acting as, uh, jurist
and judges, advisers to kings.

21:17.542 --> 21:21.375
And so, druidism, and the magic
that they were able to employ,

21:21.542 --> 21:25.417
um, is really a-a foundational
part of early Celtic society.

21:25.542 --> 21:28.500
And druids
are not necessarily men.

21:28.583 --> 21:31.458
Uh, we also have a lot
of accounts of female druidry.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.917
And it does seem
to be associated heavily

21:34.042 --> 21:35.250
with the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.

21:36.667 --> 21:39.083
NEWMAN:
They didn't just
teach things like astronomy

21:39.208 --> 21:41.167
and, you know,
harmony in nature,

21:41.250 --> 21:43.250
they were working with geomancy,

21:43.375 --> 21:45.750
the placement of ancient sites
across the landscape

21:45.875 --> 21:47.167
called geodesy.

21:47.292 --> 21:49.000
And also
working with Earth energies

21:49.167 --> 21:50.542
and even plant medicines.

21:50.708 --> 21:53.417
So they had a high understanding

21:53.542 --> 21:55.667
of these different
arts and sciences.

21:57.833 --> 22:01.500
NARRATOR:
The druids were known
to travel far and wide,

22:01.583 --> 22:03.792
seeking out the knowledge
of other cultures.

22:03.875 --> 22:06.833
But they were also said
to interact directly

22:06.917 --> 22:09.375
with the Tuatha DÃ© Danann,

22:09.542 --> 22:12.792
who shared the secrets of their
so-called magical abilities.

22:12.875 --> 22:16.125
Pliny the Elder, who was
one of the most famous

22:16.250 --> 22:18.375
of the Roman writers
and historians,

22:18.500 --> 22:22.167
he claimed that at a full moon,

22:22.292 --> 22:26.000
druids would meet at a mound,

22:26.125 --> 22:28.167
and they would trace a design

22:28.292 --> 22:30.458
that looked something
like a dragon

22:30.583 --> 22:32.667
on top of the mound,

22:32.792 --> 22:36.542
and this would summon
some sort of lightning

22:36.667 --> 22:40.958
or some phenomenon
that happened in the sky.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.583
I don't think he saw it himself.

22:42.708 --> 22:45.250
He was taking what he knew

22:45.375 --> 22:47.458
from Roman soldiers
that witnessed it.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.667
But apparently,
it frightened a lot of them.

22:49.792 --> 22:52.458
They saw lights in the sky
once the druids

22:52.542 --> 22:55.958
did this dragon ritual,
as it became known.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.208
CHILDRESS:
So it would seem
that the druids knew

22:59.333 --> 23:04.167
of the power
of certain special places.

23:04.292 --> 23:06.250
And perhaps, this is something

23:06.375 --> 23:08.833
that would summon
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.

23:08.958 --> 23:13.792
These shining people
who came from the sky.

23:13.917 --> 23:16.667
NARRATOR:
One of the many magical powers

23:16.833 --> 23:19.833
the druids were said to possess
was the ability

23:19.958 --> 23:22.542
to levitate massive stones,
which they used

23:22.667 --> 23:25.292
to construct some
of the megalithic structures

23:25.375 --> 23:27.833
found throughout
the British Isles.

23:27.958 --> 23:30.500
COLLINS:
The most famous of the druids,

23:30.625 --> 23:32.500
of course, was Merlin.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.625
Merlin was said to have...

23:37.333 --> 23:40.667
...created Stonehenge by taking

23:40.792 --> 23:43.875
an existing stone circle
from Ireland

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
and bringing it to Salisbury
Plain in Southern England.

23:49.167 --> 23:51.875
And there, using magic powers,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.667
he was able to raise
the stones into position

23:55.792 --> 23:58.375
in the manner
that we see them today.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.500
What is interesting
is that the stones

24:03.625 --> 24:06.833
that built Stonehenge
did come from a long way away.

24:06.917 --> 24:11.583
About 135 miles
away in South Wales.

24:11.708 --> 24:14.167
Somehow, they were moved
to central England,

24:14.333 --> 24:17.708
and the ancients
believed it was Merlin

24:17.875 --> 24:20.167
who was responsible for that.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.625
TSOUKALOS:
There are stories that say

24:22.708 --> 24:26.042
that some of those big,
gigantic blocks at Stonehenge

24:26.167 --> 24:29.333
were levitated into place

24:29.458 --> 24:32.458
through magical incantations.

24:32.583 --> 24:35.583
Well, what magical incantations?

24:35.708 --> 24:39.083
Because I don't think
that levitation

24:39.208 --> 24:43.375
can happen just by words.

24:43.542 --> 24:47.042
There has to be some type
of technology behind it.

24:47.167 --> 24:49.833
The idea is that, basically,

24:49.917 --> 24:54.375
this was extraterrestrial
knowledge imparted

24:54.500 --> 24:56.375
by the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.

24:56.500 --> 25:00.500
PHILLIPS:
When the Romans were here,
they say that the druids

25:00.667 --> 25:03.208
had this power
to build stone circles

25:03.333 --> 25:06.667
of which there were thousands
throughout the British Isles.

25:06.750 --> 25:10.167
HENRY:
Stonehenge, Avebury, Newgrange.

25:10.250 --> 25:13.667
These places, we find
legends attached to the druids

25:13.792 --> 25:16.875
that they were able to float
the stones through the air.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.375
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

25:19.500 --> 25:21.500
that a secret society
of Celtic priests

25:21.625 --> 25:24.292
who lived more
than 2,000 years ago

25:24.375 --> 25:28.167
had access
to otherworldly technology?

25:29.333 --> 25:30.500
According
to the ancient accounts,

25:30.583 --> 25:32.667
while the druids
were the disciples

25:32.792 --> 25:34.375
of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann,

25:34.542 --> 25:36.125
it would ultimately be a druid

25:36.208 --> 25:39.500
who brought their reign
in Ireland to an end

25:39.667 --> 25:43.500
and drove them underground.

25:49.750 --> 25:53.667
NARRATOR:
County Kerry, 1700 B.C.

25:53.792 --> 25:58.375
A fleet of ships arrives on
the southern shores of Ireland,

25:58.500 --> 26:01.708
carrying invaders
from the south.

26:01.833 --> 26:04.417
According to early
Irish accounts,

26:04.542 --> 26:06.833
they are aided by a druid
named Amergin

26:06.917 --> 26:11.583
in their conquest of Ireland.

26:11.708 --> 26:14.333
Amergin was seeking revenge
for his great uncle,

26:14.458 --> 26:18.542
who had been killed by the three
kings of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.542
COLLINS:
These were the sons of MÃ­l,

26:20.708 --> 26:24.625
better known as the Milesians.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.333
The Milesians came out
of the Mediterranean,

26:28.500 --> 26:31.292
probably from Greece or Crete

26:31.375 --> 26:34.417
or Anatolia, modern day Turkey.

26:34.542 --> 26:36.667
And they arrived in Ireland,

26:36.750 --> 26:39.958
and huge battles took place

26:40.083 --> 26:44.250
between the Tuatha DÃ© Danann
and the Milesians.

26:44.375 --> 26:47.833
NARRATOR:
Many stories have been
written about these battles,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.333
but according to the most
trusted sources,

26:50.500 --> 26:52.833
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann
agreed to a truce

26:52.958 --> 26:55.333
to save their beloved Ireland.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.667
MULLIGAN:
They did not come
to the Earth to do warfare.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.917
They came to heal the Earth
and to work with the Earth

27:00.042 --> 27:01.958
and work with Mother Earth
and all of the good energies.

27:02.042 --> 27:06.167
What was agreed upon that, um,
this country will be shared,

27:06.250 --> 27:08.667
there was room enough
for everyone in this country.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.042
COLLINS:
And it was agreed
that the Milesians

27:12.208 --> 27:16.208
would live on the ground,
on the earth itself,

27:16.375 --> 27:21.542
but that the Tuatha DÃ© Danann
would go beneath the earth,

27:21.667 --> 27:25.500
inside mounds of earth
that were known as sidhe.

27:25.583 --> 27:29.667
These acted as these doorways

27:29.792 --> 27:32.792
into a realm
where, forever after,

27:32.917 --> 27:35.583
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann would live.

27:35.708 --> 27:39.042
MULLIGAN:
It's said that they all
turned sideways into the light

27:39.208 --> 27:40.875
and just disappeared
underground.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.667
HENRY:
The Milesians then took control

27:43.792 --> 27:46.167
of the surface of Ireland.

27:46.250 --> 27:48.375
Modern-day Irish people
are thought to be descendants

27:48.542 --> 27:50.542
of the Milesians.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.583
NARRATOR:
Legend states that after

27:52.708 --> 27:55.875
the Tuatha DÃ© Danann
descended below ground,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.958
a mysterious evolution
took place.

27:59.042 --> 28:03.333
Once the Tuatha
went underground,

28:03.500 --> 28:05.542
they evolved over many years

28:05.708 --> 28:08.250
into something known
as the <i>aos sÃ­.</i>

28:08.375 --> 28:13.583
That's better known in later
mythology as the elfen folk.

28:13.708 --> 28:15.792
Elves.

28:15.875 --> 28:17.125
COLLINS:
After the Tuatha DÃ© Danann

28:17.208 --> 28:21.625
entered into the earthen mounds,
or sidhe,

28:21.750 --> 28:24.458
they became beings

28:24.542 --> 28:27.375
that could appear
in physical form

28:27.542 --> 28:30.542
but could equally vanish.

28:30.708 --> 28:34.000
Humans were able
to interact with them,

28:34.167 --> 28:37.625
often when they would see
some kind of light

28:37.750 --> 28:40.833
that would be emanating
from these earthen mounds.

28:40.958 --> 28:43.333
They would go towards them.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.042
And when they were able
to look into these lights,

28:46.167 --> 28:50.167
they could see the Tuatha DÃ©
Danann, the sidhe, the fairies.

28:50.292 --> 28:54.750
People would be able
to join them in this realm.

28:54.875 --> 28:57.833
MARTIN ETTINGTON:
Reports of elves and fairies

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
and little people have been
around in Ireland

29:01.125 --> 29:03.000
as long as people
have lived there.

29:03.083 --> 29:06.833
People saw something.
They saw some types of beings.

29:06.958 --> 29:09.375
People still see
these beings even today.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.167
NARRATOR:
One location in Ireland

29:12.292 --> 29:14.958
where sightings
of fairies are often reported

29:15.042 --> 29:17.000
is at the Hill of Tara,

29:17.125 --> 29:19.625
which is home to numerous
ancient mounds

29:19.708 --> 29:22.708
as well as a monolith
called Lia FÃ¡il.

29:22.833 --> 29:24.833
Legend states that this monolith

29:24.917 --> 29:26.542
was a gift
from the Shining Ones.

29:26.667 --> 29:29.292
COLLINS:
The Lia FÃ¡il

29:29.417 --> 29:31.458
means the "Stone of Destiny,"

29:31.542 --> 29:34.125
and it refers
to a standing stone,

29:34.208 --> 29:39.667
about five feet tall
in County Meath, Ireland.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.500
McGOWAN:
In the legends of Lia FÃ¡il,

29:41.625 --> 29:42.792
we have the Tuatha DÃ© Danann

29:42.917 --> 29:45.167
bringing the energy
of this stone

29:45.333 --> 29:48.792
down with them
to this powerful place.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.792
This place of extraordinary
energy and current

29:51.875 --> 29:55.750
because it can interact
with the energy in the land.

29:55.875 --> 29:58.500
The power of the land itself
is the reason

29:58.625 --> 30:02.750
that the Danann come to this
location, the Hill of Tara.

30:02.875 --> 30:05.458
It was said that when
the rightful king of Ireland

30:05.583 --> 30:08.667
came in contact with Lia FÃ¡il,

30:08.792 --> 30:10.708
it would scream out to announce

30:10.875 --> 30:13.625
that this was the rightful
king of all Ireland.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.750
It would then imbue the king

30:15.875 --> 30:19.292
with qualities of strength
and longevity and health,

30:19.375 --> 30:21.500
in order that he might
reign over Ireland

30:21.625 --> 30:23.958
for a very long time.

30:24.042 --> 30:29.000
To this day, ceremonies
take place on the Hill of Tara.

30:29.083 --> 30:31.833
CHILDRESS:
The ancient Irish
associated this stone

30:31.917 --> 30:35.667
with the elven folk
and the fairies,

30:35.833 --> 30:39.125
and people continue
to see them today,

30:39.250 --> 30:41.750
and probably,
we will continue to see them

30:41.875 --> 30:43.750
in the future as well.

30:43.875 --> 30:47.958
NARRATOR:
If otherworldly beings
called the Tuatha DÃ© Danann

30:48.083 --> 30:50.458
truly existed
in ancient Ireland,

30:50.542 --> 30:53.708
is it possible that
they are still present today,

30:53.875 --> 30:56.792
now known as the sidhe,
or fairy folk,

30:56.875 --> 30:58.917
who inhabit the thousands
of earthen mounds

30:59.042 --> 31:01.167
found throughout the country?

31:01.292 --> 31:04.375
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

31:04.542 --> 31:07.250
and suggest that they may occupy

31:07.375 --> 31:10.083
a parallel dimension.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.375
NARRATOR:
Today, organizations exist

31:17.500 --> 31:19.000
throughout the world

31:19.167 --> 31:21.375
that investigate
potential encounters

31:21.500 --> 31:24.125
with extraterrestrials
visiting Earth.

31:26.958 --> 31:28.917
But long before
these groups existed,

31:29.042 --> 31:31.042
the people of the British Isles

31:31.167 --> 31:35.375
were examining another
type of otherworldly phenomenon.

31:36.708 --> 31:39.500
In the 1920s, something very
strange happened in Ireland.

31:39.625 --> 31:43.167
There were suddenly
mass sightings of fairies.

31:43.250 --> 31:47.000
So much so that a captain,
Quintin Craufurd,

31:47.125 --> 31:48.833
formed what he called

31:48.958 --> 31:52.083
the Society for
the Investigation of Fairies,

31:52.208 --> 31:55.333
which was a very scientific
and serious approach

31:55.500 --> 31:58.917
at collecting data
about these fairy sightings.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.833
CHILDRESS:
Like a modern UFO group today,

32:02.958 --> 32:05.500
their mission was

32:05.667 --> 32:08.083
to study elves,
figure elves out,

32:08.208 --> 32:12.000
what they were doing there,
try to communicate with elves.

32:12.083 --> 32:15.333
And they absolutely believed
that fairies and elves

32:15.417 --> 32:18.708
were real and existed
throughout the British Isles.

32:18.875 --> 32:23.000
NARRATOR:
People from all walks of life
contacted the organization

32:23.125 --> 32:27.083
reporting encounters with beings
they believed were fairies.

32:27.208 --> 32:31.083
Witnesses described fairies
leading them to buried relics,

32:31.208 --> 32:34.167
walking through solid walls,

32:34.250 --> 32:38.542
and even transforming
into orbs of light.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.292
HENRY:
This society did
important research

32:41.375 --> 32:44.208
up until World War II, when
their records were destroyed.

32:44.333 --> 32:48.583
And then in 1949,
they began doing research again.

32:48.708 --> 32:52.500
Hundreds of members joined
the society in the 1950s,

32:52.625 --> 32:55.042
including Walt Disney.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.792
Now, what's amazing about this
is that in order to become

32:57.875 --> 33:01.000
a member of the society,
you had to declare

33:01.083 --> 33:04.000
an absolute belief
in the existence of fairies.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.417
And who other than Walt Disney
in the modern world

33:06.542 --> 33:09.250
is more closely connected
to fairies?

33:09.375 --> 33:12.458
CHILDRESS:
The idea that you would
actually have

33:12.583 --> 33:16.583
a very serious society
that was looking into fairies,

33:16.708 --> 33:20.667
shows that in the British Isles
and in Ireland,

33:20.792 --> 33:24.292
the whole concept of elven folk

33:24.375 --> 33:26.292
and fairies and leprechauns

33:26.375 --> 33:29.542
is very real
and continues to this day.

33:29.667 --> 33:32.292
NARRATOR:
In 1969,

33:32.417 --> 33:34.583
French astronomer Jacques VallÃ©e

33:34.708 --> 33:37.000
published a groundbreaking book
on unexplained phenomena

33:37.125 --> 33:40.083
called <i>Passport to Magonia:</i>

33:40.208 --> 33:43.667
<i>From Folklore to Flying Saucers.</i>

33:43.750 --> 33:47.417
In it, he proposed that
historical accounts of fairies

33:47.542 --> 33:50.500
and other strange beings
could be the same phenomenon

33:50.625 --> 33:54.792
that today is interpreted
as extraterrestrial.

33:54.917 --> 34:00.042
Jacques did what I think is one
of the most important books

34:00.208 --> 34:04.667
about the UFO phenomena,
trying to understand,

34:04.792 --> 34:07.292
of all the things
in the sky and on the ground

34:07.417 --> 34:12.000
through history that have either
been painted, photographed,

34:12.083 --> 34:16.417
caught on radar,
what are they and why are they?

34:16.542 --> 34:20.500
TZADOK:
Every culture speaks
of the "others,"

34:20.667 --> 34:24.500
whether it be the wee people,
the leprechauns,

34:24.625 --> 34:28.667
or the fairies
or the angels or the demons.

34:28.750 --> 34:31.042
Our brothers in Islam
know them very well,

34:31.208 --> 34:33.042
and they're called the djinn.

34:33.167 --> 34:36.917
And the one thing
that is taught about the djinn

34:37.042 --> 34:40.833
is essentially,
they are energetic beings,

34:40.958 --> 34:46.375
and their place of residence is
in the domains of inner earth.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.958
And this leads us
to ask the question,

34:49.083 --> 34:51.292
if the domains of inner earth

34:51.375 --> 34:54.833
are actually physical
within this dimension

34:54.958 --> 34:58.375
or possibly
in a parallel dimension.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.833
NARRATOR:
According to VallÃ©e,

35:00.917 --> 35:04.667
the strange beings that humans
have reported encountering

35:04.792 --> 35:09.833
for thousands of years may,
in fact, be interdimensional.

35:09.958 --> 35:12.833
BIRNES:
VallÃ©e believes that

35:12.917 --> 35:15.667
from the time of the Big Bang,

35:15.792 --> 35:17.667
if it created one universe,

35:17.792 --> 35:20.833
why couldn't it create
a multitude of universes?

35:20.958 --> 35:23.542
Might there be connections

35:23.708 --> 35:26.458
between the different
universes where elements

35:26.583 --> 35:31.208
from the other universe
cross into our universe,

35:31.333 --> 35:35.875
and where elements of
our universe cross into theirs?

35:36.042 --> 35:40.042
That would explain how people
coming upon the sidhe

35:40.167 --> 35:43.583
might not just see an
underground civilization,

35:43.708 --> 35:47.000
but they might see an
interdimensional civilization.

35:47.167 --> 35:50.708
NARRATOR:
Could it be that sightings
of fairies

35:50.833 --> 35:54.667
and similar figures described
in other ancient traditions

35:54.750 --> 35:58.458
are encounters with beings
that occupy parallel dimensions?

35:58.542 --> 36:01.375
And if so,
are these the same beings

36:01.500 --> 36:05.125
described today
as extraterrestrials?

36:06.375 --> 36:08.000
BUTLER:
There are possible parallels

36:08.167 --> 36:11.167
between the sidhe
or fairies that seem

36:11.250 --> 36:14.458
to be similar to UFO,
uh, accounts.

36:14.583 --> 36:17.125
For example,
seeing strange lights.

36:17.208 --> 36:21.000
Like what's known as,
in Irish and British tradition,

36:21.125 --> 36:22.333
the will-o'-the-wisp.

36:22.458 --> 36:25.333
Um, these fairy lights
that move,

36:25.417 --> 36:28.333
uh, and lead people astray.

36:28.458 --> 36:30.917
HOWE:
When you get
to the 20th century,

36:31.042 --> 36:34.542
and where people were trying
to figure out human abductions,

36:34.667 --> 36:37.208
you start hearing
from people saying,

36:37.333 --> 36:39.792
"Well, they shape-shifted
in front of me.

36:39.917 --> 36:42.958
"There were beams of light
that took us up and down.

36:43.083 --> 36:47.000
"They can disappear, they
can go through windows, walls."

36:47.125 --> 36:51.792
And those are the same verbs
and nouns that were being used

36:51.917 --> 36:55.708
in the centuries before
in Ireland and other places

36:55.833 --> 37:00.542
about fairies and so-called
pretend creatures.

37:00.667 --> 37:04.500
BUTLER:
There are stories
and personal experiences

37:04.583 --> 37:08.500
similar to UFO accounts
that have been recorded,

37:08.625 --> 37:12.667
of missing time
where somebody i-is taken

37:12.792 --> 37:15.458
into the otherworld
by the fairies,

37:15.542 --> 37:19.083
and, uh, thinks they've
been there for a few hours,

37:19.208 --> 37:22.208
but it's been a few days
when they return.

37:22.333 --> 37:25.167
TSOUKALOS:
Oftentimes, you hear stories

37:25.333 --> 37:29.750
of missing time, of people
disappearing for weeks,

37:29.875 --> 37:32.292
or losing their memory

37:32.417 --> 37:36.167
for significant events,
and frankly,

37:36.292 --> 37:39.417
that is similar to what you hear

37:39.542 --> 37:42.917
from modern-day
UFO abduction stories.

37:43.042 --> 37:48.083
NARRATOR:
Could it be that the folklore
of cultures all around the globe

37:48.208 --> 37:50.542
is based on
an otherworldly presence

37:50.667 --> 37:52.083
that people
have been encountering

37:52.208 --> 37:54.542
since humankind's
earliest history?

37:54.708 --> 37:57.583
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

37:57.708 --> 38:01.375
and according to the Irish,
at least once a year,

38:01.500 --> 38:05.792
the veil is lifted
between our realm and theirs.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.042
NARRATOR:
The Hill of Uisneach, Ireland.

38:16.167 --> 38:18.875
Located 60 miles
west of Dublin.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.875
This site has been sacred
to the Irish for centuries.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.667
Each year in early May,

38:26.750 --> 38:29.250
locals gather
at this sacred site

38:29.375 --> 38:31.917
to celebrate
the ancient festival of Beltane.

38:33.333 --> 38:36.333
Dating back more
than 3,000 years,

38:36.500 --> 38:39.167
Beltane and its famous bonfire

38:39.250 --> 38:41.833
provide a link between
modern Christian Ireland

38:41.917 --> 38:44.833
and its pagan Celtic past.

38:44.958 --> 38:48.917
This festival is
the traditional start of summer.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.667
The Celtic peoples
divided the year

38:52.750 --> 38:56.292
into a dark half
and then a bright half,

38:56.375 --> 38:57.792
marked at Beltane.

38:57.917 --> 39:00.167
It was so important
that people understood

39:00.292 --> 39:03.167
precise times of year
for agricultural reasons.

39:03.292 --> 39:04.583
The people working the fields

39:04.708 --> 39:06.375
didn't have
the knowledge of astronomy.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.083
So the fire was a signal,
and they saw the fire.

39:09.208 --> 39:11.375
From the highest point
on Uisneach,

39:11.542 --> 39:13.458
20 counties are visible.

39:13.583 --> 39:16.292
So once the main fire is lit
on Uisneach in a circle,

39:16.417 --> 39:18.667
all of the hills around
light their fires,

39:18.833 --> 39:21.167
and then it spreads and spreads
throughout the whole country.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.458
And it happens instantly.

39:23.542 --> 39:26.000
The fire is a signal
to all of the country

39:26.125 --> 39:27.500
that now is the summertime.

39:27.625 --> 39:30.167
NARRATOR:
But Beltane,

39:30.292 --> 39:32.583
which is also celebrated
at other ancient sites

39:32.708 --> 39:37.000
throughout Ireland, serves
another, more profound purpose.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.667
Many Irish believe
that during this festival,

39:40.833 --> 39:44.375
it is possible for humans
to peer inside the mounds

39:44.500 --> 39:46.750
into an entirely
different reality.

39:46.875 --> 39:49.500
BUTLER:
There's a threshold or boundary

39:49.625 --> 39:52.167
between worlds
that becomes thin.

39:52.250 --> 39:56.000
And human beings can see
into the otherworld

39:56.125 --> 39:59.917
or encounter otherworldly
beings, uh, more easily.

40:00.042 --> 40:02.500
Beltane, or May Day,

40:02.625 --> 40:05.125
is associated very strongly
with the sidhe,

40:05.250 --> 40:08.167
the fairy people,
the Shining Ones.

40:08.292 --> 40:11.417
NARRATOR:
Through festivals like Beltane,

40:11.542 --> 40:14.292
the people of Ireland
maintain a strong connection

40:14.417 --> 40:17.000
to the traditions of their past,

40:17.125 --> 40:21.000
traditions of shining beings
who came down from the sky

40:21.167 --> 40:26.583
and continue to live on
within the ancient mounds.

40:26.708 --> 40:28.708
JOHNSON:
When I was growing
up in Ireland,

40:28.875 --> 40:32.333
people, at least in the,
in the rural areas--

40:32.417 --> 40:34.708
and Ireland
was very rural at the time--

40:34.833 --> 40:39.583
nobody would admit
to not believing in the fairies.

40:39.708 --> 40:43.625
The existence of the fairy folk
was not questioned.

40:43.750 --> 40:48.375
TSOUKALOS:
This idea that Ireland
has had this love affair

40:48.500 --> 40:51.000
with leprechauns and fairy folk,

40:51.125 --> 40:53.458
I would ask the question, "Well,

40:53.542 --> 40:55.875
what is the underlying meaning
of this?"

40:56.000 --> 40:58.667
Because stories
of fairy folk go back

40:58.792 --> 41:01.792
at least 3,000 years in Ireland.

41:01.875 --> 41:05.125
In the case
of the Tuatha DÃ© Danann,

41:05.250 --> 41:07.333
it's even earlier.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.875
It's possible
that what we have here

41:11.042 --> 41:16.167
is one of the earliest examples
of ancient astronaut teachers.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.542
MULLIGAN:
I've reached a certain age
in my life now

41:18.667 --> 41:20.333
that it's not about believing,

41:20.417 --> 41:23.000
it's just that
this is the way it is now.

41:23.167 --> 41:26.333
So, do we believe in fairies
and leprechauns in Ireland?

41:26.417 --> 41:28.500
Absolutely, 100%.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.125
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

41:31.250 --> 41:33.875
that beneath the idyllic
rolling countryside of Ireland,

41:34.042 --> 41:36.958
there are entrances
to a hidden realm

41:37.083 --> 41:41.042
that has been inhabited
by otherworldly beings

41:41.208 --> 41:43.542
for more than 3,000 years?

41:43.708 --> 41:46.625
Could they be the descendants
of extraterrestrials

41:46.708 --> 41:50.917
who were responsible for
the creation of the human race?

41:51.042 --> 41:54.167
Perhaps the whimsical legends
of Ireland

41:54.333 --> 41:57.333
are not so whimsical after all,

41:57.458 --> 42:00.000
but contain profound truths

42:00.167 --> 42:02.000
about an alien presence on Earth

42:02.125 --> 42:05.250
that is still with us today.
