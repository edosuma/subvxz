00:01.819 --> 00:03.942
<i>Kids, sophomore year of college,</i>

00:04.110 --> 00:05.929
<i>when Lily came back
from spring break,</i>

00:06.054 --> 00:08.039
<i>Marshall surprised her
at the airport.</i>

00:08.330 --> 00:11.329
<i>And she surprised him with
a six-pack of locally brewed beer.</i>

00:11.454 --> 00:13.431
Fort Lau-ger-Dale!
Get it?

00:14.134 --> 00:16.241
<i>And with that, a ritual was born.</i>

00:16.935 --> 00:19.739
<i>For the next 11 years, whenever
either of them would fly anywhere...</i>

00:19.864 --> 00:21.166
Minne-Cider!

00:21.334 --> 00:22.342
Get it?

00:22.658 --> 00:25.681
<i>... the reunion was always
commemorated with a chauffeur sign</i>

00:25.849 --> 00:27.570
<i>and a six-pack from
wherever they'd been.</i>

00:27.696 --> 00:29.474
Aspen Yards Ale!

00:30.213 --> 00:32.203
- Get it?
- Actually, no.

00:32.369 --> 00:34.209
Me, neither.
I was hoping you would.

00:35.423 --> 00:38.598
<i>But, one night in January of 2009,
the unthinkable happened.</i>

00:38.875 --> 00:40.872
- I'm not picking her up.
- What?

00:41.380 --> 00:43.860
Lily doesn't want me taking a cab
all the way to the airport

00:43.985 --> 00:45.956
just to take a cab
all the way back, you know?

00:46.366 --> 00:48.106
But the six-pack thing.

00:48.875 --> 00:52.313
That stuff was fun when we were younger,
but we've grown past that.

00:52.439 --> 00:55.403
As we mature,
the relationship matures with us.

00:55.769 --> 00:58.406
But... you guys are such
an inspiration to the rest of us,

00:58.532 --> 01:00.713
how you're so devoted and connected.

01:01.095 --> 01:04.226
I look at you guys, and that's
all I want in the whole world.

01:04.757 --> 01:07.924
Ted, there's two college girls outside,
and they look easy!

01:10.748 --> 01:12.034
Arizona, you know,

01:12.159 --> 01:14.842
I've always wanted to see what
an Arizona driver's license looks like.

01:15.011 --> 01:16.558
I already ran that play. They're 21.

01:16.726 --> 01:19.358
We're good. Thank God.
So, what brings you guys to town?

01:19.527 --> 01:22.365
- Our band's got a gig.
- Oh, you're in a band?

01:22.490 --> 01:25.461
- Maybe we'll come see you play.
- Excuse us for a sec.

01:27.061 --> 01:28.723
What is the matter with you?

01:28.891 --> 01:31.237
- We're not gonna go see them play.
- Why not?

01:31.363 --> 01:33.265
If we see them play, we're no better

01:33.390 --> 01:37.208
than the bleach-blonde bimbos who flash
their boobs at a Van Halen concert.

01:37.468 --> 01:40.845
But don't those girls get to have sex
with Van Halen after the show?

01:41.014 --> 01:43.961
If you want to have sex with Van Halen,
do it on your own time.

01:44.086 --> 01:46.629
We are not the maybe-we-can-come-
see-you-play guys.

01:46.754 --> 01:49.915
We're the other guys,
the older guys who never showed up

01:50.041 --> 01:52.266
and whose approval they now crave.

01:53.420 --> 01:55.478
- So we're their dads?
- Exactly.

01:58.541 --> 02:01.344
It's a big meeting,
so I don't think we're gonna make it.

02:01.470 --> 02:02.918
Maybe next time, kiddos.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.138
If you want to meet us after your show,
maybe we could exchange numbers.

02:06.263 --> 02:07.610
Excuse us for a minute.

02:09.626 --> 02:13.328
Ted, have you gone completely insane?
We don't want their phone numbers.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.171
I don't know what I was doing.
I guess I panicked out there.

02:17.147 --> 02:19.294
When you exchange
numbers with a chick,

02:19.420 --> 02:21.950
you give them the ability
to call and cancel.

02:22.076 --> 02:25.242
If you set a date without a number,
they have to show up.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.199
Check and mate!

02:28.479 --> 02:30.646
The only digits I need are these.

02:32.590 --> 02:33.593
Honka.

02:34.694 --> 02:36.342
Are you still their dad?

02:38.571 --> 02:41.127
So, why don't we just meet here
tomorrow night around 10:00.

02:41.421 --> 02:43.320
I think it's supposed to snow.

02:43.446 --> 02:46.686
- What do we do if there's a blizzard?
- Either way, we'll be here.

02:47.122 --> 02:48.503
"Snow" problem.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.845
Excuse us just one last second.

02:53.253 --> 02:54.798
What is the problem now?

02:56.136 --> 02:57.455
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

02:59.271 --> 03:01.876
- We'll see you tomorrow night.
- Totally. Awesome!

03:02.850 --> 03:04.309
"Totally. Awesome!"

03:04.435 --> 03:06.347
Man, these college chicks
sound stupid.

03:06.472 --> 03:08.342
- Totally.
- Awesome. So, here's the thing:

03:08.467 --> 03:12.285
tomorrow night, dress to move;
it's gonna be a mess!

03:12.891 --> 03:15.074
I still think we should've gotten
their numbers.

03:15.405 --> 03:17.889
You always assume
something is gonna go wrong.

03:18.014 --> 03:20.927
Ted, I promise you,
nothing is gonna go wrong.

03:22.706 --> 03:24.171
It's starting to snow.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074

03:36.353 --> 03:38.715
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

03:49.538 --> 03:52.060
<i>Kids,
the blizzard of '09 was a monster.</i>

03:52.256 --> 03:54.042
<i>It snowed for three days straight,</i>

03:54.243 --> 03:56.994
<i>which led to three amazing stories.</i>

03:57.274 --> 03:58.758
<i>I'll start with me and Barney.</i>

03:58.883 --> 04:01.351
It's pretty nasty out there.
I don't think they're coming.

04:01.476 --> 04:03.234
Of course they're coming.
They have to.

04:03.593 --> 04:06.703
If I can land just one of these girls,
I'll have party school bingo.

04:12.398 --> 04:14.227
Come on, Ted.
You're the only one here.

04:14.396 --> 04:16.317
Sorry.
What's party school bingo?

04:17.447 --> 04:21.726
Every year, Playboy releases a list
of the top party schools in the country.

04:21.851 --> 04:24.033
I take the top 25, and I make up...

04:24.574 --> 04:25.721
a bingo card.

04:26.602 --> 04:28.776
All I need is Arizona Tech,

04:28.944 --> 04:30.197
which is crazy.

04:30.366 --> 04:33.586
In league play, that would
normally be designated a free space.

04:33.711 --> 04:36.342
So, how many people are
in on this party school bingo thing?

04:37.406 --> 04:38.653
It's just me.

04:38.977 --> 04:40.503
So what's the point, then?

04:40.629 --> 04:43.423
The point is to get five in a row.

04:44.789 --> 04:47.053
And what do you get
when you get five in a row?

04:49.509 --> 04:51.032
I get bingo.

04:53.390 --> 04:54.695
Thanks for coming by.

04:54.821 --> 04:57.096
I monkeyed around with
the thermostat for about an hour

04:57.221 --> 04:58.917
before I realized
it was the intercom.

04:59.357 --> 05:01.277
I heard you swearing downstairs.

05:01.527 --> 05:04.895
So, Lily's flight's coming in tonight,
you're really not gonna go pick her up?

05:07.954 --> 05:08.986
Like I said,

05:09.362 --> 05:12.210
as we mature,
our relationship matures with us.

05:12.853 --> 05:14.302
Yeah, if I know your wife,

05:14.470 --> 05:16.642
she's gonna get you
that six-pack anyway.

05:23.772 --> 05:24.920
Puget Stout.

05:25.335 --> 05:28.180
A most exquisite Seattle microbrew.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.563
And speaking of six-packs...

05:37.284 --> 05:39.652
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the airport.

05:39.778 --> 05:42.855
How could I be so stupid?
Of course she's bringing me a six-pack!

05:43.023 --> 05:45.540
But this time,
I didn't bring him a six-pack.

05:46.117 --> 05:48.107
Because... as we mature,

05:48.333 --> 05:50.315
the relationship matures with us.

05:51.298 --> 05:53.563
He sounds like a nice young man.

05:54.152 --> 05:57.109
I'll bet he surprises you
and picks you up anyway.

06:04.299 --> 06:07.310
- Where's my beer?
- We said we weren't gonna.

06:10.028 --> 06:11.124
I have beer.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.957
A six-pack and you're
an appropriate height for me.

06:14.554 --> 06:16.151
Let's go, New Lily.

06:18.584 --> 06:22.276
<i>- Man, I got to get some beer.
- Folks, this is your captain speaking.</i>

06:22.444 --> 06:25.255
<i>Looks like we're going to be arriving
an hour early.</i>

06:27.838 --> 06:29.843
Drink up, boys.
I'm closing the bar.

06:30.460 --> 06:33.396
- It's only 9:00.
- And this place is ragin', yo!

06:35.404 --> 06:38.580
Guys, I'm really sorry, but I got to go
set up cots in the church basement.

06:38.705 --> 06:40.670
It doubles as a shelter
on snowy nights like this.

06:41.073 --> 06:42.227
You selfish bastard!

06:42.353 --> 06:44.767
There are two very hot girls
coming here to meet us.

06:44.935 --> 06:46.724
Can't you leave open
a little while longer?

06:46.849 --> 06:49.257
- We'll keep an eye on everything.
- You two? No way.

06:49.382 --> 06:51.465
You wouldn't know the first thing
about running a bar.

06:51.591 --> 06:53.172
Serve the hotties first?

06:53.966 --> 06:55.375
Here's the keys.

06:59.862 --> 07:01.150
Here's the keys.

07:01.532 --> 07:04.590
As soon as your girls show up,
you turn off the lights and you lock up.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.841
I don't want to come back
and find this place trashed.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.599
- Seriously?
- I can trust you guys.

07:09.767 --> 07:12.418
<i>To understand what it meant
to us to get the keys to MacLaren's, </i>

07:12.544 --> 07:14.291
<i>I have to take you back a few years</i>

07:14.417 --> 07:16.278
<i>to the night that
I uttered five little words</i>

07:16.404 --> 07:18.588
<i>that every man at some point
in his life will say.</i>

07:18.950 --> 07:22.517
- We should buy a bar.
- Of course, we should buy a bar!

07:22.685 --> 07:24.189
We should totally buy a bar.

07:24.358 --> 07:27.032
- We should totally buy a bar.
- Our bar would be awesome.

07:27.462 --> 07:29.791
And dude, dude, dude,

07:30.674 --> 07:31.778
dude...

07:32.931 --> 07:34.614
the name of our bar...

07:35.638 --> 07:36.662
Puzzles.

07:37.465 --> 07:39.598
People will be like,
"Why is it called Puzzles?"

07:39.869 --> 07:41.376
That's the puzzle.

07:42.665 --> 07:44.325
That is...

07:45.396 --> 07:47.181
a great name for a bar!

07:47.903 --> 07:49.784
And also, at Puzzles:

07:50.131 --> 07:51.237
no last call.

07:51.406 --> 07:52.575
No last call!

07:52.743 --> 07:55.477
Only when every single person
is finished having the greatest night

07:55.603 --> 07:58.082
of his or her life do we stack
the chairs on the table

07:58.207 --> 08:00.392
and power down the three-story
margarita waterfall.

08:01.758 --> 08:03.945
- We should buy a bar.
- We should buy a bar.

08:04.662 --> 08:06.785
<i>Like the other
ill-advised five-word sentences </i>

08:06.910 --> 08:08.794
<i>every man eventually says
in his life...</i>

08:09.642 --> 08:11.511
I can jump that far.

08:12.139 --> 08:13.645
I'm gonna win her back.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.696
I can trust you guys.

08:15.821 --> 08:18.786
<i>... we would come to regret it.
We just didn't know it yet.</i>

08:45.023 --> 08:47.314
You have it?
Awesome! I'll be right there.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.368
I'm Rachel Sondheimer.

08:53.686 --> 08:55.114
Wait a minute, Lily.

08:55.283 --> 08:58.490
If you are getting off the plane,
where is Marshall?

08:58.764 --> 09:01.118
- And where is your six-pack?
- That's the problem.

09:01.244 --> 09:04.019
I have to get to Brewniverse
in East Meadow in an hour.

09:05.282 --> 09:07.246
- To the Town Car!
- Thank you.

09:08.550 --> 09:10.289
Barkeep. Triple Sec.

09:11.019 --> 09:12.681
Coming right up, tap-minder.

09:16.376 --> 09:17.564
We'll get one.

09:19.738 --> 09:21.152
- Order up.
- Order up.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.336
We'll get one.

09:26.462 --> 09:28.851
Thank God you're still here.

09:29.019 --> 09:31.903
<i>I don't know if you guys have ever seen
Star Wars, but it's like Hoth out there.</i>

09:32.350 --> 09:33.221
Dibs.

09:33.347 --> 09:36.274
It reminds me of when
I used to go sledding with my dad...

09:36.475 --> 09:37.713
before he left.

09:37.882 --> 09:38.853
And dibs.

09:39.338 --> 09:41.141
So, can we warm you up with a drink?

09:41.310 --> 09:44.904
Sure... by the way, I invited the rest
of the band to come and meet us.

09:45.348 --> 09:48.196
We were hoping to get drunk.
I mean really drunk.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.796
Like my dad used to.

09:50.188 --> 09:52.036
Dibsity, dibsity, dibsity.

09:52.902 --> 09:55.302
I guess we could keep
the place open a little bit longer.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.277
As long as
it's just you and the band.

10:00.269 --> 10:02.587
Melissa, what kind of band is this?

10:03.044 --> 10:05.765
We're the Arizona Tech
Fighting Hens Marching Band.

10:05.987 --> 10:07.298
Go, Hens!

10:07.931 --> 10:11.534
<i>And then, your Uncle Barney and I
had one of our telepathic conversations.</i>

10:12.202 --> 10:14.133
<i>Dude, Carl's gonna kill us</i>

10:14.258 --> 10:16.652
<i>if we don't kick everyone
out of here right now.</i>

10:21.313 --> 10:24.452
<i>Barney, I'm serious. We promised
we wouldn't mess the place up.</i>

10:29.398 --> 10:31.261
<i>All right, I guess you have a point.</i>

10:32.215 --> 10:33.774
The bar is open!

10:35.787 --> 10:37.147
Who wants a beer?

10:40.745 --> 10:42.386
I still say this is stupid.

10:42.740 --> 10:46.063
What happened to, "As we mature,
the relationship matures with us"?

10:46.233 --> 10:49.702
That's just something Lily read
in Psychology Today.

10:51.203 --> 10:52.761
All right, she read it in Cosmo.

10:53.146 --> 10:54.683
All right, I read it in Cosmo.

10:55.024 --> 10:57.767
All right, it was Cosmo Girl.
Just drive, okay.

10:58.077 --> 10:59.626
I don't get why it's such a big deal

10:59.751 --> 11:01.789
that one little ritual
goes by the wayside.

11:01.915 --> 11:05.420
It's not just this, okay?
It's all our little rituals.

11:06.239 --> 11:09.245
Do you know what we used to do
every day the second I got home?

11:09.370 --> 11:12.528
Man, I don't want to hear
about your crazy monkey sex.

11:13.357 --> 11:16.081
We would tell each other
what we had to eat that day.

11:17.455 --> 11:19.647
Two eggs, a slice of cheese pizza

11:19.773 --> 11:21.097
and some steamed veggies.

11:21.590 --> 11:23.409
Everything bagel, chicken breast,

11:23.534 --> 11:26.053
some celery sticks
and a spoon of peanut butter.

11:27.668 --> 11:29.904
- Crazy monkey sex?
- Crazy monkey sex.

11:34.852 --> 11:35.814
TMI...

11:35.939 --> 11:37.542
too many informations.

11:38.078 --> 11:39.726
You know what else I miss?

11:39.885 --> 11:41.497
Our lunchtime phone call.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.799
Baby, it's lunchtime,
and I love you.

11:45.637 --> 11:47.392
I reciprocate in principle.

11:47.852 --> 11:49.566
Although with the caveat
that there seems

11:49.735 --> 11:51.657
to be a bit of a surplus here
on my end.

11:52.827 --> 11:55.314
No, I love you more.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.181
Do we need to get in a room together
and bang this thing out?

12:02.728 --> 12:04.700
Those sound like agreeable terms,

12:05.138 --> 12:07.732
although I may need
adjust my briefs.

12:10.275 --> 12:11.323
Love you, too.

12:12.633 --> 12:14.648
But today when she called,

12:14.883 --> 12:17.536
I let it go to voice mail.
Voice mail!

12:17.661 --> 12:19.084
How could you?!

12:19.333 --> 12:22.174
The thing I miss most is kissing
at midnight on New Year's Eve.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.265
It was a New Year's tradition.

12:24.742 --> 12:26.787
But you know what we did this year?

12:27.434 --> 12:29.490
- Crazy monkey sex?
- No.

12:33.261 --> 12:36.805
Okay, all these cute, adorable
little rituals... They're stupid.

12:37.297 --> 12:41.406
Telling each other what you had to eat?
You're like children playing house.

12:42.983 --> 12:45.689
Maybe you just think they're stupid
because you've never been

12:45.814 --> 12:48.051
in a relationship long enough
to develop them.

12:48.236 --> 12:50.617
- What?
- You don't understand love.

12:50.742 --> 12:54.356
Okay, you're like some robot
who sees a person crying and says...

12:54.742 --> 12:57.248
"Why is that human leaking?"

12:57.449 --> 12:58.575
Is that right?

12:59.202 --> 13:02.461
Well, then... Robot initiating
pull-over-to-the- side-of-the-road-

13:02.586 --> 13:05.614
until-jackass-apologizes-
to-me sequence.

13:12.195 --> 13:15.249
My robot was like,
a million times better.

13:19.868 --> 13:22.122
So you know, the trough
in the bathroom is overflowing.

13:22.726 --> 13:24.542
There's no trough in the bathroom.

13:25.211 --> 13:27.404
And you just came out
of the kitchen.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.546
What's in a gin and tonic?
What's in a gin and tonic?

13:32.374 --> 13:34.454
Running a bar sucks.
Let's just close up.

13:35.836 --> 13:37.084
There's no last call.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.844
Puzzles, go for Barney.

13:39.012 --> 13:41.620
Good. You're still there.
I'll be there in five.

13:42.891 --> 13:43.926
Last call.

13:50.298 --> 13:52.526
There's a snowplow coming.
We have to get back on the road.

13:52.651 --> 13:55.525
You think the only way to be
in love is to have pet names.

13:55.657 --> 13:57.748
Or leave each other stupid,
little notes

13:57.874 --> 14:01.460
or go charging off into a blizzard
for no good reason.

14:01.630 --> 14:03.467
Do you understand
what's going to happen?

14:03.636 --> 14:05.748
You know what you are?
You're a love snob.

14:05.874 --> 14:07.815
There's lots of ways
to be in a relationship,

14:07.984 --> 14:10.991
you would know that if you ever left
your little love snob country club.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.793
We're going to get buried by snow.
That's going to happen.

14:14.016 --> 14:17.237
No, screw this. I'm not going
to sit here and be insulted.

14:17.779 --> 14:20.518
We're not going to the airport.
We're going home.

14:23.726 --> 14:25.062
What just happened?

14:31.359 --> 14:33.608
We called earlier
about the Seattle microbrew.

14:33.813 --> 14:37.370
Good thing you called when you did.
I was getting ready to close up.

14:37.699 --> 14:39.754
Storm of the century out there.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.024
Of course, it's only '09,
so storm of the century might be

14:43.149 --> 14:44.771
a little bit premature.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.846
Let's say storm of the year.

14:46.971 --> 14:48.910
Although, it is only January.

14:49.078 --> 14:52.211
We're in kind of a hurry,
so, we'll take the beer now.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.427
You are a cute couple.

14:54.618 --> 14:56.266
- Thank you.
- We're not a couple.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.441
Thank God.
That would be weird.

15:01.786 --> 15:03.138
Here she is.

15:03.263 --> 15:04.628
"Supersonic Tonic."

15:05.267 --> 15:07.973
No. This is a keg.
I need a six-pack.

15:08.313 --> 15:10.407
- A keg's all I got.
- We'll take the keg.

15:10.532 --> 15:13.783
What? Oh, no.
Last time I had one of these in the car,

15:14.105 --> 15:17.176
I wound up chipping dried vomit
off the seat

15:17.301 --> 15:18.465
with a putty knife.

15:18.634 --> 15:20.808
I'm sorry, Ranjit,
but this is a ritual

15:20.933 --> 15:22.520
and I am bringing him this beer.

15:24.736 --> 15:26.818
If you could just put it in the car.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.606
I'll give you 50 bucks.

15:29.732 --> 15:30.951
To the Town Car.

15:36.999 --> 15:39.618
Robin, I'm sorry.
You're not a robot.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.055
If you are, you're,
like, an incredibly advanced model,

15:44.180 --> 15:46.098
and the human race
doesn't stand a chance.

15:47.564 --> 15:49.749
You just don't choose
to show your love

15:49.873 --> 15:51.907
through corny rituals,
and that's fine.

15:52.439 --> 15:55.270
But maybe the reason Lily and I do
is because we always have,

15:55.396 --> 15:57.306
and we don't know any other way.

15:58.153 --> 15:59.719
One thing I do know is that

15:59.844 --> 16:02.184
if she's there sitting
at the airport alone,

16:03.230 --> 16:04.784
I have to go get her.

16:05.439 --> 16:06.832
Those are the rules.

16:09.062 --> 16:10.428
Marshall, close your eyes.

16:11.786 --> 16:14.902
I don't know how you heard
any of that as me hitting on you, but...

16:15.070 --> 16:16.072
Just do it.

16:24.494 --> 16:26.244
Now let's go get your woman.

16:27.489 --> 16:29.286
All right, come on.

16:29.618 --> 16:32.124
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.300
I've always wanted to say that.

16:34.469 --> 16:37.149
I mean, in a bar.
I say it all the time at home.

16:38.396 --> 16:40.779
Dude, someday we should buy a bar.

16:40.948 --> 16:43.844
And when we do,
we are never going to have last call.

16:45.683 --> 16:49.558
Come on, Barney. We said no last call.
We've got to mean it.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.818
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Carl's going to be here any minute.

16:53.775 --> 16:55.159
Only one thing we can do.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.813
Dude, running a bar
is a pain in the ass.

17:00.939 --> 17:03.354
We should just stick
with what we know.

17:04.696 --> 17:07.407
- We should start a band.
- Of course we should start a band!

17:07.770 --> 17:09.707
How have we not started a band yet?

17:11.894 --> 17:14.781
<i>Kids, sometimes in life
the planets align,</i>

17:15.063 --> 17:16.563
<i>everything links up,</i>

17:16.732 --> 17:18.595
<i>and your timing is perfect.</i>

17:39.958 --> 17:42.207
<i>This wasn't one of those times.</i>

17:44.791 --> 17:45.875
Where is she?

17:46.497 --> 17:47.500
Seattle.

17:48.065 --> 17:49.681
- What?
- Her flight's canceled.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.011
It never took off.

17:51.369 --> 17:53.348
She would've called me and...

17:58.119 --> 17:59.451
Baby, it's me.

17:59.576 --> 18:02.208
My flight's been canceled
because of some snowstorm

18:02.333 --> 18:04.137
and they couldn't rebook me
till Thursday,

18:04.718 --> 18:06.896
<i>so I'm stuck here
for another two days.</i>

18:07.535 --> 18:10.198
<i>But it's lunchtime, and I love you.</i>

18:11.955 --> 18:14.379
<i>Like I said,
this was a three-day storm.</i>

18:15.056 --> 18:17.074
<i>- Tuesday.
- I still say this is stupid.</i>

18:17.614 --> 18:18.751
Wednesday.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.155
<i>- And Thursday.
- ... microbrew.</i>

18:22.574 --> 18:24.705
<i>So on Tuesday when Marshall
heard that message...</i>

18:25.125 --> 18:26.838
She's not coming in till Thursday.

18:27.486 --> 18:30.593
I mean, we came all the way down here,
and she's not coming in till Thursday.

18:30.719 --> 18:31.721
I feel so stupid.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.909
Look, let's just, let's not tell Lily
about any of this, okay?

18:36.859 --> 18:38.941
Especially the part
about you hitting on me.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.607
I didn't hit on you.

18:41.059 --> 18:42.062
Exactly.

18:43.626 --> 18:44.880
<i>Then on Wednesday...</i>

18:45.005 --> 18:47.363
Man, I can't believe you drove
all the way out there.

18:47.532 --> 18:50.331
Now you're gonna turn around and drive
all the way out there again tomorrow.

18:52.085 --> 18:55.158
This whole thing was a sign, you know?
It's time to put that old ritual to bed.

18:55.283 --> 18:57.078
I'm not going to pick her up.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.568
Robin really hit on you?

18:59.305 --> 19:00.115
Dude,

19:00.858 --> 19:01.787
it was weird.

19:02.665 --> 19:03.590
Bros,

19:03.715 --> 19:05.800
this party is awesome!

19:06.256 --> 19:08.054
You are true friends
of the Fighting Hens.

19:08.179 --> 19:11.235
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.616
Is the flute section seeing anyone?

19:16.963 --> 19:19.219
So, wait, you're really
not going to pick her up?

19:19.344 --> 19:21.478
- Really.
- So the New Year's kiss,

19:21.603 --> 19:24.312
the lunchtime phone calls,
the whole

19:24.848 --> 19:27.915
"this is what I ate today" thing,
you're really letting it all go?

19:30.118 --> 19:31.163
I really am.

19:31.901 --> 19:33.842
<i>Which brings us to Thursday.</i>

20:14.899 --> 20:17.361
A muffin, a pastrami sandwich,

20:17.487 --> 20:18.617
and a bag of chips.

20:18.742 --> 20:21.676
And I know it's way past
lunchtime, but I love you.

20:22.064 --> 20:24.501
More and more each day,
I love you, Lily.

20:25.749 --> 20:26.859
Happy New Year.

20:33.574 --> 20:36.182
Wait, does this mean that I have
to bring a marching band to the airport

20:36.351 --> 20:37.771
- from now on?
- Absolutely.

20:37.940 --> 20:38.942
Crap.

20:50.732 --> 20:51.863
Go, Hens!

20:53.506 --> 20:54.509
Puzzles.

20:55.070 --> 20:57.545
That is a great band name.

21:00.210 --> 21:01.808
Have you seen Amanda?

21:02.680 --> 21:03.779
Bingo!
