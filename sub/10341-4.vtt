WEBVTT

01:47.816 --> 01:51.068
Daddy.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.367
Daddy.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.703
Leland.

02:02.705 --> 02:05.332
Daddy.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.543
Leland.

02:09.337 --> 02:13.924
Daddy. Daddy. Leland.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.801
Leland.

02:17.804 --> 02:25.811
Leland.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.813
Yeah.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.399
You have the right to an attorney.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.318
I waive that right.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.781
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

02:38.491 --> 02:42.828
Anything you say may be held
against you in a court of law.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.454
Do you understand?

02:44.706 --> 02:46.957
Yes, of course, I do.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.881
On Friday morning, March 3rd,

02:54.090 --> 02:57.634
did you go
to Calhoun Memorial Hospital?

02:58.928 --> 03:00.554
Yes.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.807
Why did you go there?

03:04.809 --> 03:07.311
I was looking for someone.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.105
Who were you looking for?

03:10.481 --> 03:12.900
The man who killed my daughter.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.155
Did you know his name?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.781
No.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.910
Yes. I do now.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.496
Jacques Renault.

03:27.665 --> 03:32.336
What made you think
he killed Laura?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.005
You arrested him.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.264
Leland...

03:45.683 --> 03:49.353
...did you kill Jacques Renault?

03:53.191 --> 03:55.317
He killed my Laura.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.906
Have you ever experienced

04:01.157 --> 04:04.159
absolute loss?

04:04.994 --> 04:07.829
I doubt that any one of us
is a stranger to grief.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.332
No, more than grief.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.962
It's deep down.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.838
Inside.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.259
Every cell screams.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.594
You can hear...

04:23.346 --> 04:25.264
...nothing else.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.895
Yes.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.900
I ki...

04:37.110 --> 04:38.944
I killed him.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.822
Yes.

04:42.323 --> 04:45.867
Yes, yes, yes.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.121
Yes.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.172
He'll plead temporary insanity.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.799
We'll need a psychiatric exam.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.593
I'll tell you one thing,
parents should not bury their children.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.762
Anyone who's been through
what Leland has is...

05:05.930 --> 05:08.307
Do you approve of murder,
Dr. Hayward?

05:08.474 --> 05:09.933
No.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.064
Hey, doc.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.402
- How are you, Andy?
- Fine.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.571
Great. Fine.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.198
What's the problem?

05:27.535 --> 05:29.328
It's kind of personal.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.788
I'm your doctor, Andy.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.584
It's about my sperms test.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.586
Yes?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.088
You know, I flunked.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.716
That's not the precise term for it.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.177
Well, I was just wondering

05:45.345 --> 05:48.096
if it's the kind of test
you can take over.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.224
You know, like a driver's exam.

05:51.476 --> 05:56.396
I mean, I've been wearing boxer shorts
every day just like you told me.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.273
You wanna give it another shot?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.650
Yes, sir. I would.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.446
I'll need to take a sample with me.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.907
- Right now?
- Put it in a brown bag.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.992
I'll wait in the car.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.498
Hmp!

06:59.710 --> 07:02.045
Lucy, I've got
a garbage truck here on...

07:03.297 --> 07:05.215
Oh, shut up.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.802
Our judge arrives this afternoon.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.012
Clinton Sternwood.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.056
Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.100
Outdoors enthusiast?

07:15.476 --> 07:17.602
Last of the frontiersmen.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.312
They broke the mold.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.818
I only got bail hearing for Leland
and Leo's competency examination.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.486
Will Leland get bail?

07:27.488 --> 07:29.531
Well, Harry, that's up to
your state prosecutor.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.408
That'd be Daryl Lodwick.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.201
Also on his way.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.870
When do we hear from Hawk?

07:35.079 --> 07:36.746
He called this morning.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.207
Now, the county...

07:40.251 --> 07:42.335
...says nobody
by the name of Robertson

07:42.503 --> 07:45.130
had ever lived
next to the Palmers.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.134
We got a current address
on the last occupants.

07:49.343 --> 07:52.471
Kalispell.
We'll check it by afternoon.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.100
- Hey. Watch it, Andy.
- Sorry, Bob.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.102
Oh, my God.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.111
Andy, don't move.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.532
- Where did you get those?
- Don't make me say

08:12.700 --> 08:14.117
where these came from.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.911
Andy?

08:17.455 --> 08:21.875
Please, Agent Cooper,
this is extremely personal business.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.211
Your boots?

08:24.754 --> 08:27.255
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:27.465 --> 08:31.843
I bought these from Phillip Gerard
yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.225
These are the same brand of boots
we found at Leo Johnson's.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.603
The Giant said
there was a clue out there.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.146
I thought it was the cocaine?

08:43.356 --> 08:46.107
Harry, we've gotta find Phillip Gerard,
the one-armed man.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.860
Can I go now, Agent Cooper?

08:49.070 --> 08:51.071
I don't know how much time I've got.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.739
If you must.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.539
Harry, what's with Lucy?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.101
- Mr. Horne.
- Walk and talk.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.645
This friend of mine works
with the Seattle Post-Dispatch.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.940
Actually, my sister went to college
with her but she's a friend of mine too.

09:27.108 --> 09:31.236
Anyway, she called me this morning
with a hot tip. Top secret.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.447
M.T. Wentz is coming
to Twin Peaks.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.866
M.T. Wentz. M.T. Wentz.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.828
M.T. Wentz, the travel writer.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.705
Yes, M.T. Wentz the travel writer.

09:41.872 --> 09:45.542
Wentz travels incognito,
uses only cash, no credit cards.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.085
Nobody can trace his identity.

09:47.253 --> 09:51.423
Or hers. No one at the paper
even knows who he or she is.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.050
Favorable Wentz review
could be quite useful.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.219
Well, he's coming.
He's coming, he's coming.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.139
Keep an eye on the registration.
I want an hourly update.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.767
- Scrutinize every check.
- Especially if they pay cash.

10:02.935 --> 10:07.022
Not even 9:30 and you have
already done a good day's work.

10:07.189 --> 10:11.234
Oh. Ha-ha. Whoo.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.161
Mr. Horne.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.288
You look well.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.209
- What can I do for you?
- Oh, we've met.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.670
I sell insurance
to the small business.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.547
Like One-Eyed Jack.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.468
Jean Renault.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.429
What's the occasion?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.973
Are my premiums
about to be raised?

10:42.183 --> 10:45.185
No, no. Nothing like that.

10:45.686 --> 10:49.564
Please.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.921
You bastard.

11:13.172 --> 11:17.133
- You bastard!
- Make no mistake, Mr. Horne.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.010
I'm just the messenger.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.929
From whom?

11:22.556 --> 11:26.101
They request a large sum of money.

11:28.020 --> 11:33.191
- How much?
- I require something else entirely.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.694
They should bear the cost
of their own middleman.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.362
Ah.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.490
Number one.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.742
Your business up there

11:42.952 --> 11:45.412
is being run
by pickpockets and fools.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.831
A dollar earned is a dollar stolen.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.041
Are you aware of that?

11:50.501 --> 11:51.876
I have my suspicions.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.295
What you need is a partner.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.425
Someone who can take care
of these little problems.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.344
- I have a partner.
- Okay.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.848
Do you want my help or no?

12:09.395 --> 12:10.687
Yes.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.148
One more thing.

12:16.736 --> 12:20.655
I want this man
to bring to me the ransom.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.992
This man is an FBI agent.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.411
Do you want your daughter back?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.246
Of course, I want my daughter back

12:28.414 --> 12:29.831
- but I can't...
- Shh.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.459
Cash...

12:32.710 --> 12:34.335
...partner...

12:36.088 --> 12:38.047
...FBI man.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.010
This is supposed to be
an equitable exchange.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.512
This could turn out well.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.222
Huh?

12:49.894 --> 12:52.395
Expect a call tomorrow...

12:52.730 --> 12:54.272
...noon.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.670
Janet. Ahem.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.174
Find Agent Cooper for me.
It's urgent.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.138
You're kidding?

13:28.098 --> 13:29.390
What's he look like?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.684
Well, you're looking
real pretty today, Donna.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.937
- Thanks.
- Special occasion?

13:34.104 --> 13:37.857
Yeah. I'm having lunch today
with someone I met on my route.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.194
Bedpans and shut-ins.
Who's to meet?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.488
You wouldn't understand.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.992
- Don't spill the soup.
- Thanks, Louie.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.245
Hey, listen to this.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.455
I just got a call from Louie
at the Northern.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.666
M.T. Wentz is coming
to Twin Peaks.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.209
Empty who?

13:56.377 --> 13:59.087
Hank, he's the most powerful
restaurant critic in the state.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.505
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.590
And a good review
from him and his Seattle paper

14:02.758 --> 14:04.384
could give us a lot of business.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.220
So she's gonna try to
send him our way.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.683
What's he look like?

14:11.892 --> 14:14.602
Well, nobody knows.
I guess it's a secret.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.855
But he's supposed to be
arriving today.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.023
Then we still got time.

14:20.651 --> 14:28.783
Time for what, Hank?

14:30.244 --> 14:33.204
I'm gonna pick up some flowers

14:33.372 --> 14:36.207
and maybe some candles
and some tablecloths.

14:36.417 --> 14:40.461
And what can we add to the menu?
Some specials maybe.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.589
I always wanted to try
some regional dishes.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.383
Mm! Babe, we're gonna
trick this place out

14:45.551 --> 14:47.218
like Christmas on the Fourth of July.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.555
Oh, and I think
you should give Big Ed a call.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.058
- Why?
- Well...

14:54.226 --> 14:55.977
...you're still friendly, right?

14:56.145 --> 14:58.479
So maybe this Wentz guy
stops in for gas.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.983
Ed could suggest the Double R
to any new faces he sees.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.611
- I'll call him.
- Good.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.487
You do that.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.255
So...

15:25.049 --> 15:27.258
...what shall we drink to?

15:28.010 --> 15:33.014
To Laura.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.935
In our hearts and memories, locked.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.698
Her diary.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.242
Did I tell you I had it?

15:54.244 --> 15:55.995
- Laura's diary?
- Mm-hm.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.832
Shall I read something from it?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.918
It seems appropriate.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.753
- Please.
- Mm.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.927
Ah.

16:13.055 --> 16:18.142
"But still I'm afraid to tell her
of my fantasies and my nightmares.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.561
Sometimes she's good
at understanding.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.439
Other times she just giggles
and I don't have the nerve to ask

16:23.607 --> 16:26.734
why things like that
are funny to her.

16:27.945 --> 16:32.156
So I feel badly again
and shut up about it for a long time.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.658
I love Donna very mu...

16:35.744 --> 16:39.747
But sometimes I worry that
she wouldn't be around me at all

16:39.957 --> 16:43.167
if she knew what my insides
were like.

16:44.586 --> 16:48.923
Black and dark
and soaked with dreams of...

16:49.800 --> 16:53.261
...big, big men and different ways
that they might hold me

16:53.429 --> 16:56.973
and take me into their control."

16:59.685 --> 17:01.436
I'm sorry.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.980
No, don't be.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.899
I... I was just, I mean...

17:07.109 --> 17:10.862
I mean, if that's evidence,
shouldn't we give that to the sheriff?

17:11.989 --> 17:13.573
No.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.658
I mean...

17:15.826 --> 17:19.078
I've... I've read this
from cover to cover, Donna,

17:19.288 --> 17:22.373
and there are no solutions here.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.542
Besides...

17:25.544 --> 17:27.712
...she gave it to me.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.839
Why?

17:31.341 --> 17:35.094
People come to me
and tell me their stories

17:35.304 --> 17:38.264
about the world outside.

17:38.807 --> 17:43.311
I take their stories
and place them

17:43.520 --> 17:46.022
in a larger context.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.608
A sort of living novel.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.318
Who tells you?

17:50.527 --> 17:52.820
Oh, friends.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.282
Lovers.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.664
Well, maybe, someday, you will too.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.424
You were right.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.886
Her kidnappers contacted me
this morning.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.597
Damn me, but you were right.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.600
Why didn't you alert the sheriff?

18:22.768 --> 18:26.104
They'll kill her at first sign of police
involvement. That's why I called you.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.564
That's no reason to circumvent
normal channels.

18:28.732 --> 18:33.736
Normal channels won't bring
my daughter back to me alive.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.074
You and Audrey...

18:41.370 --> 18:43.788
You have a special relationship.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.332
You, of all people,

18:46.500 --> 18:49.252
understand her value to me.

18:51.338 --> 18:54.715
They wanna make
the exchange tomorrow.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.468
Audrey...

18:57.761 --> 19:00.680
...for $125,000.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.682
Cash.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.561
But I must ask you.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.066
Will you take it there?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.911
Josie.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.080
Oh, Pete.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.833
So sorry.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.378
Yeah, me too.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.840
You know, I...

19:36.049 --> 19:38.384
...keep thinking about Andrew.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.304
What he would have done
about the fire.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.892
Thank goodness Catherine was here
to handle everything.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.229
What is it?

19:51.481 --> 19:53.232
Josie,

19:53.692 --> 19:57.028
Catherine died in the fire.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.614
God, no.

20:00.073 --> 20:05.161
Oh, Pete.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.251
We're...

20:12.920 --> 20:15.463
We're planning a service...

20:16.715 --> 20:19.300
...but they haven't found the body.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.052
Oh, Pete.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.472
In a couple of days we'll go ahead.

20:25.474 --> 20:30.603
I don't know exactly
what we'll be burying.

20:39.029 --> 20:43.532
Right this way. Come on,
dreamboat. Daddy's waiting.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.077
Come on.

20:46.286 --> 20:51.123
Miss Horne was a very bad girl,
refusing to take her medicine.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.710
- Please.
- Weren't you, Miss Horne?

20:55.212 --> 20:56.879
Audrey?

20:58.215 --> 20:59.590
Audrey,

20:59.800 --> 21:02.176
have you been mistreated?

21:05.013 --> 21:08.557
- He hit me.
- Ah.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.352
I did not hit her.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.105
If that's what you're thinking, I didn't.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.190
That was wrong.

21:16.858 --> 21:21.028
It will never happen again
as long as you're with me.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.114
Do you understand?

21:26.493 --> 21:28.995
I spoke with your father
this morning.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.330
You're in no danger.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.167
Everything going to be fine.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.169
You do trust me.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.921
Don't you, Audrey?

21:39.589 --> 21:41.757
You see, Audrey,

21:41.967 --> 21:44.176
in a situation like this,

21:44.386 --> 21:48.556
you have to handle yourself
in a professional manner.

21:48.765 --> 21:52.768
We're all reasonable people
and what you discover

21:52.936 --> 21:56.355
is that something reasonable
can always be worked out

21:56.523 --> 21:59.984
whenever reasonable people
just put their minds...

22:07.576 --> 22:09.452
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.120
No.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.398
Lucy?

22:39.983 --> 22:42.526
Lucy, we need to talk.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.655
Deputy Brennan,

22:46.823 --> 22:50.201
I thought you preferred
the company of your magazine?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.373
Andy?

22:55.582 --> 22:57.917
Maybe you'd better get some air.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.091
Lucy,

23:05.300 --> 23:08.219
I think we're at the point where
it would be healthier for everyone

23:08.387 --> 23:12.056
if you got whatever was
bothering you out in the open.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.479
Andy and I used to go out.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.815
That much I gathered.

23:22.109 --> 23:25.986
For a year and a half until I started
to notice things about him.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.991
They weren't big things,
they were little things.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.123
He never exercises.

23:37.332 --> 23:41.669
He never washes his car
and he doesn't even own a sports coat.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.296
Uh-huh. Well, did you do
something about this?

23:44.965 --> 23:49.343
Well, after I watched this TV show,
I decided I needed some me time

23:49.511 --> 23:51.554
during which
we didn't see each other.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.599
During which period
I met Dick Tremayne.

23:57.394 --> 24:01.605
Horne's Department Store,
Men's Fashions.

24:01.982 --> 24:06.068
He had lots of coats and keeps himself
and his car in great shape.

24:10.157 --> 24:14.160
Most of his behavior was asinine,

24:14.786 --> 24:17.163
but at least he was different.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.916
Are you still seeing this Dick?

24:25.213 --> 24:26.672
No.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.843
Lucy, do you wanna get
back together with Andy?

24:35.974 --> 24:37.141
I don't know.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.644
Well, Lucy, can you tell me exactly
what you do want?

24:43.064 --> 24:44.899
I don't know.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.698
Sorry, Harry, I was trying to help.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.742
Well, it was a good thought.

24:54.951 --> 24:59.413
But it's like trying to fix
those potholes over on Highway 9.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.749
First heavy rain and pfft.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.960
You've been down this road before?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.129
Sure have.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.925
Harry.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.262
I've got a dangerous situation.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.182
I've examined every possible angle

25:18.350 --> 25:21.227
and I believe
there's only one way to proceed.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.522
I need a favor, strictly between us.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.273
What's up?

25:26.942 --> 25:30.611
I need one of the Bookhouse Boys.
Your best man.

25:30.820 --> 25:34.114
It would be better
if you didn't know why.

25:35.575 --> 25:38.619
Cooper, I've steered clear
when you asked me to.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.622
Is there anything I need to know
about this one?

25:41.831 --> 25:43.958
Absolutely not.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.126
I'll set it up.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.587
Nine-thirty at the Roadhouse.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.464
Thanks, Harry.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.954
- It must be him.
- Here we go.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.208
Good evening, sir,
welcome to the Double R Diner.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.043
Thanks, could I have a booth?

26:28.253 --> 26:30.462
Of course, right this way.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.598
We have two very delicious
specials this evening...

26:40.765 --> 26:44.435
I'm sure you do but I'll have
a cheeseburger, medium,

26:44.644 --> 26:47.438
a Coke and some fries.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.815
Very good.

26:53.236 --> 26:54.528
Excuse me, Toad?

26:54.738 --> 26:57.197
Why don't we finish this up
in the kitchen?

26:57.365 --> 26:59.158
- Mm. Mm-mm.
- There you go.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.952
Get in the back
and don't touch anything.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.662
He only wanted a cheeseburger.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.873
It must be some kind of
food-critic trick.

27:06.082 --> 27:07.875
- You think so?
- Absolutely, yeah. I think...

27:08.043 --> 27:09.251
CUSTOMER CLEARS THROAT]

27:15.842 --> 27:17.134
Bathroom?

27:18.011 --> 27:19.428
Oh, right this way, sir.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.140
We just finished painting it
and it looks really nice.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.434
It's completely private.
Yeah, follow me.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.102
Oh, sorry.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.938
- Good stuff.
- Toad!

27:30.106 --> 27:32.941
- Toad, get out of my...
- Mm. Whoops.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.675
Thanks for coming.

27:58.593 --> 28:02.096
- I didn't know...
- Know what?

28:03.014 --> 28:05.599
I didn't know if you were mad or not.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.102
I mean, how mad.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.771
I'll survive.

28:10.980 --> 28:15.234
Donna, there's nothing going on
between me and James.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.568
What if there is? I mean,

28:16.736 --> 28:19.530
who said James and I
couldn't see other people?

28:20.156 --> 28:21.907
I certainly didn't.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.870
Are you saying you're seeing
someone else?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.292
Maddy, I need your help.

28:36.005 --> 28:39.258
- How?
- Harold Smith has Laura's diary.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.928
I thought the sheriff
had Laura's diary.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.307
Harold said that Laura kept
a second diary that I didn't know about

28:47.475 --> 28:48.976
and he's got it.

28:49.185 --> 28:50.728
God.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.815
We have to tell James about this.

28:57.026 --> 28:59.486
If Laura did have a secret diary...

29:00.196 --> 29:02.114
...and Harold's got it...

29:03.074 --> 29:06.243
...I'm gonna get it
with or without you.

29:08.955 --> 29:11.331
Tell that to James.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.243
I know I paid too much for it,

29:48.411 --> 29:51.038
but I just fell in love with it.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.708
I heard the salesperson say,

29:54.876 --> 29:56.919
"The only reason
we're still in business

29:57.128 --> 30:00.130
is because Josie Packard
buys retail."

30:03.468 --> 30:04.927
I like it.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.054
- You do?
- I like it, yeah.

30:10.683 --> 30:13.018
- You're so cold.
- Josie.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.522
Josie, I gotta know.
Were you really in Seattle?

30:16.731 --> 30:20.359
Yes, why are you so suspicious?

30:20.568 --> 30:22.903
Look at these boxes.

30:23.112 --> 30:25.322
You think I got them
at Cash and Carry?

30:25.490 --> 30:27.533
Why didn't you tell me
you were going?

30:27.742 --> 30:30.327
You know I had to get away,
I was afraid.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.664
- I know, afraid of Ben and Catherine.
- You know that.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.124
And now Catherine's dead.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.753
Harry?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.881
- You don't think I...
- I don't know what to think.

30:43.049 --> 30:46.051
- I don't know.
- You think I could burn the mill?

30:46.261 --> 30:49.012
That I would ruin
everything of mine?

30:49.597 --> 30:51.974
There's insurance money.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.185
My God.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.730
How could you?

30:59.399 --> 31:03.527
How could you think
of such terrible things?

31:04.028 --> 31:06.530
How could you hurt me so?

31:21.379 --> 31:23.881
I was just so worried.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.051
I'm sorry.

31:28.553 --> 31:32.681
Hold me.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.059
- Take me.
- Josie.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.520
- I want you to take me.
- Josie.

31:38.730 --> 31:42.858
Josie, why?
Why didn't you tell me?

31:51.075 --> 31:52.868
Tear it.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.828
What?

31:55.038 --> 31:56.747
Tear it.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.471
I want you.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.767
I need you.

32:24.108 --> 32:26.109
I want you

32:26.402 --> 32:28.278
more than my own life.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.023
Hi, good-looking.

33:05.441 --> 33:08.819
Who do you have to grease
to get some coffee around here?

33:09.028 --> 33:12.280
Judge Sternwood.
Hello, Your Honor.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.659
Lucy, you're a cool drink of water

33:15.827 --> 33:18.078
to road-weary eyes.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.538
What's your secret?

33:20.957 --> 33:24.126
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.

33:26.295 --> 33:27.629
Give us a hug?

33:31.551 --> 33:35.804
Ah. Life is hard, dear.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.015
Still and all, it's...

33:38.182 --> 33:41.226
It's harder in most places
than in Twin Peaks.

33:41.894 --> 33:43.562
Clinton.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.814
Sorry I'm late.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.316
Oh, I only just arrived.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.902
Good to see you.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.614
What's her name, Harry?

33:56.242 --> 33:57.993
- What?
- You got the look of a man

33:58.202 --> 33:59.703
with filly trouble, son.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.875
If they don't take the saddle,
you got two options.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.502
- And I won't bore you with either one.
- Harry?

34:08.921 --> 34:11.381
Judge Sternwood,
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.966
FBI.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.011
- How are you, lad?
- Your Honor.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.722
You two should have
a lot in common.

34:19.265 --> 34:21.933
Sid will bring in the court calendar
as soon as the Winnebago

34:22.101 --> 34:23.560
is tanked up.

34:23.853 --> 34:26.563
You wanna break the seal
on that Irish you stashed for me?

34:27.398 --> 34:28.774
Right this way.

34:29.942 --> 34:34.196
Mr. Cooper, how do you find
our little corner of this world?

34:34.405 --> 34:36.281
Heaven, sir.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.409
Well, this week, heaven includes

34:39.619 --> 34:43.455
arson, multiple homicides

34:43.664 --> 34:46.833
and an attempt on the life
of a federal agent.

34:47.043 --> 34:50.087
Heaven is a large
and interesting place, sir.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.051
Lucy?

34:58.012 --> 34:59.471
Dick.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.640
Lucy, I haven't slept.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.767
I can't eat.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.270
I've been absolutely miserable.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.524
You have?

35:11.067 --> 35:14.361
I've been a fool, a cad,
the way I've behaved and I'm...

35:14.695 --> 35:17.989
I'm deeply, deeply ashamed.

35:19.575 --> 35:21.118
You are?

35:21.327 --> 35:23.120
I've been over it in my mind
a million times

35:23.287 --> 35:25.372
and what I've come to is this.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.999
I have to...

35:28.209 --> 35:31.253
No, I must do the right thing.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.006
You must?

35:37.552 --> 35:38.677
It's...

35:38.845 --> 35:41.179
It's everything I could
scrape together.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.890
I'm completely knackered.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.482
What is this?

35:53.025 --> 35:56.153
Six hundred and fifty dollars.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.696
I've called around.

35:57.905 --> 36:00.490
I've been told
it's more than adequate.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.244
For what?

36:05.246 --> 36:06.955
For the...

36:07.165 --> 36:08.957
To take care of...

36:09.750 --> 36:11.209
You know...

36:11.460 --> 36:13.753
...the little problem.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.590
Richard,

36:17.008 --> 36:19.551
here's what you're going to do:

36:20.136 --> 36:22.345
Take your money,

36:22.555 --> 36:26.308
put it back in your wallet
or your pocket,

36:26.684 --> 36:29.728
turn around and walk through
both sets of doors...

36:29.937 --> 36:32.022
The second one sticks sometimes.

36:32.231 --> 36:36.985
- go out into the parking lot,
get in your car, turn the key,

36:37.195 --> 36:40.864
and never, ever speak to me again

36:41.032 --> 36:43.325
as long as you live!

36:43.534 --> 36:47.078
Say one more word and I'll scream.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.914
Leave, please.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.264
Dick!

37:10.269 --> 37:12.395
Dick.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.031
Leland...

37:24.158 --> 37:27.285
...this is most difficult.

37:27.828 --> 37:29.788
My deepest condolences

37:30.414 --> 37:33.124
on your heartbreaking loss.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.419
Thank you, sir.

37:37.129 --> 37:41.091
You've appeared before me
many times.

37:41.300 --> 37:45.303
I know you to be a fine,
decent man

37:45.513 --> 37:47.847
and a capable attorney.

37:48.057 --> 37:51.726
And to see you under
these circumstances is...

37:51.936 --> 37:54.604
Is dreadful for us all.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.315
Now, the law provides a structure

37:57.483 --> 38:00.902
to guide us through
perilous and trying times.

38:01.612 --> 38:07.784
But it requires our submission
to its procedures and higher purposes.

38:08.077 --> 38:13.957
Before we assume our respective roles
in this enduring drama...

38:15.001 --> 38:17.502
...just let me say that

38:17.795 --> 38:22.757
when these frail shadows
we inhabit now

38:23.134 --> 38:25.760
have quit the stage,

38:26.679 --> 38:28.471
we'll meet

38:29.140 --> 38:32.642
and raise a glass again together

38:33.060 --> 38:34.769
in Valhalla.

38:40.192 --> 38:42.402
Would that it were so.

38:43.863 --> 38:47.907
I understand it's your intention
to represent yourself.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.618
Correct.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.914
Well, where's Lodwick,
the prosecutor?

38:55.124 --> 38:56.916
- Overdue.
- Well, I suggest

38:57.126 --> 38:59.044
we leave the question of bail
till morning.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.340
The facilities are adequate, Leland?

39:03.549 --> 39:04.841
Oh, yes.

39:05.051 --> 39:08.219
Everyone has been most kind.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.305
Then we'll say good night.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.849
- Deputy.
- Good night.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.729
Thank you.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.323
I'll speak for us all.

39:29.533 --> 39:32.410
We have hard jobs.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.626
We're ready to roll.

39:40.795 --> 39:44.339
Well, hi, Sid.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.216
Harry.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.219
Sid, say hello
to Special Agent Cooper.

39:49.428 --> 39:52.138
- Agent Cooper.
- How do you do?

39:52.348 --> 39:54.349
Well, gentlemen,

39:54.892 --> 39:58.436
we've been eight hours
on the road.

39:58.646 --> 40:02.524
Sid and I are gonna pile it over
to The Great Northern,

40:02.733 --> 40:06.569
hook up the Winne
and dine in the Timber Room.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.531
See you in court.

40:14.995 --> 40:16.663
Wife?

40:16.872 --> 40:20.125
Uhn-uhn. Law clerk.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.253
Man, oh, man.

40:25.631 --> 40:29.300
Harry, is everything set for tonight?

40:29.718 --> 40:32.303
- He'll be there.
- Okay.

40:42.064 --> 40:43.481
Is this your friend Katrina?

40:43.649 --> 40:46.359
Katrina? Katrina.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.821
And this is Miss...

40:53.075 --> 40:54.451
Come along, girls.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.703
All right, Mr. Tojamura. We're all set.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.206
Now, what credit card
do you wanna put that on?

41:41.415 --> 41:44.417
- Cash, please.
- Cash?

41:44.627 --> 41:46.419
Fine.

41:46.629 --> 41:49.464
Where did you say
you traveled from, sir?

41:49.673 --> 41:52.592
- Seattle.
- Seattle?

41:52.801 --> 41:56.012
Oh, that's not such a long trip, then.
Ha-ha.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.224
Very good, Mr. Tojamura.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.809
The bellman will take you
up to your suite.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.603
And if you would like to treat yourself

42:03.771 --> 42:07.065
to some of our outstanding
local cuisine while you're here,

42:07.233 --> 42:10.693
I would recommend
the Double R Diner.

42:11.153 --> 42:13.029
Ask for Norma.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.990
Thank you very much.

42:23.791 --> 42:26.084
Norma, it's Louie.

42:26.293 --> 42:29.879
I think the eagle has landed.

42:32.007 --> 42:34.300
Pete, meet my cousin Jonathan.

42:34.468 --> 42:35.885
Jonathan.

42:36.095 --> 42:39.097
You thinking cousin have some joe?

42:39.306 --> 42:42.850
After a long flight it will help him
reset his biographical clock.

42:43.102 --> 42:46.437
Mm-hm. That's "biological."

42:46.814 --> 42:48.815
I think so, I just made a fresh pot.

42:49.024 --> 42:51.526
Here. Cup of joe coming up.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.529
- Biological.
- Biological.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.909
Don't know how you lasted six years.

43:00.119 --> 43:02.161
Nothing but hayseeds
and manual laborers.

43:02.371 --> 43:04.414
Well, we all got our job to do.

43:04.623 --> 43:06.583
Yours is nearly finished.

43:06.792 --> 43:09.794
The sale of the mill
and the Packard lands?

43:10.004 --> 43:12.589
Signing the contracts soon.
I need Pete's signature.

43:12.798 --> 43:15.091
- He's Catherine's heir.
- Will that be difficult?

43:15.301 --> 43:17.260
- No.
- How long?

43:17.469 --> 43:20.805
- Two days.
- We're expected back in Hong Kong.

43:21.015 --> 43:24.142
Mr. Eckhardt wants very much
to see you.

43:24.768 --> 43:28.438
Are there any other complications?

43:29.898 --> 43:31.941
There might be a problem with Hank.

43:32.943 --> 43:34.902
I'll deal with him.

43:35.904 --> 43:38.615
- Are we suspected?
- Certainly not.

43:38.824 --> 43:40.867
What about this sheriff?

43:41.076 --> 43:42.452
He means nothing to me.

43:42.661 --> 43:44.495
That's not what I asked you.

43:54.965 --> 43:58.426
Nine-thirty, right on the tick.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.054
Is he here?

44:01.263 --> 44:03.056
He's here.

44:11.398 --> 44:14.609
Are we in any particular hurry?

44:14.818 --> 44:16.277
Harry,

44:16.487 --> 44:19.364
let me buy you a beer. Bartender?

44:22.701 --> 44:24.786
All right, I'm coming!

44:24.995 --> 44:26.621
All right!

44:28.957 --> 44:31.000
Hey, we're not op...

44:35.964 --> 44:38.508
Oh, fart.

44:54.149 --> 44:55.441
What's the deal?

44:59.905 --> 45:01.155
Huh?

45:03.617 --> 45:06.369
Do I know you?

45:13.794 --> 45:15.712
Okay.

45:37.860 --> 45:41.279
Listen, I think I'm just gonna
lay here for a while.

45:42.448 --> 45:45.575
What?

45:55.043 --> 46:00.047
Blood brother,
next time I take your head off.
