INDISTINCT TV CHATTER

00:59.760 --> 01:04.040
That is where our future lies, Rodney,
second-hand motors.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.920
Next year, we'll be millionaires.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.640
I dreamt I was drownin' last night.

01:09.720 --> 01:16.680
See, the government's going to have
to ban the import of foreign cars
to save our own car industry.

01:17.240 --> 01:22.160
But the unions won't stand for that
so they'll all go out on strike.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.360
You won't be able to buy a new car!

01:25.600 --> 01:27.440
-Oh?
-No.

01:27.520 --> 01:32.760
So, Rodney, Britain's future
lies in the second-hand car game.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.640
What did you say?
You dreamt that you were drownin'?

01:37.720 --> 01:40.440
D'you mean you wet the bed last night?

01:41.600 --> 01:43.520
No, I don't!

01:43.600 --> 01:47.600
I'm depressed,
and these cornflakes are lousy.

01:48.160 --> 01:53.600
Rodney, you make my teeth itch!
I keep asking you, go and phone her!

01:53.680 --> 01:59.200
-She knows I won't phone her first.
-Did you tell her that?

02:00.280 --> 02:02.600
-No...
-No! Phone her and tell her.

02:02.680 --> 02:08.040
-That's stupid!
-It's no more stupid
than the mood you're in!

02:08.480 --> 02:14.600
When you're gettin' your end away,
skies are blue and the lager's cool!

02:15.160 --> 02:20.040
A tart with fat thighs chucks you
and you're depressed!

02:20.120 --> 02:26.000
Monica and I were having problems
getting it together on a one-to-one basis!

02:26.160 --> 02:31.200
My mate Micky Pearce advised us to
have a two-week trial separation.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.080
What? You've only known her for two weeks!

02:36.160 --> 02:41.160
What is it? A fortnight on,
a fortnight off, like sentry duty?

02:41.240 --> 02:45.440
I'm not phoning her, Grandad.
Plenty more chicks about.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.840
Come on then.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.920
Fancy a blind date with a Samaritan?

02:50.520 --> 02:54.960
I'll survive, Del.
And Monica doesn't have fat thighs.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.240
-She has!
-She has not!

02:58.320 --> 03:04.080
I saw her down the disco,
and either she has fat thighs
or she was boppin' in jodhpurs!

03:05.680 --> 03:08.600
-Monica was out dancing?
-Yeah.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.240
With your mate, Micky Pearce, in fact!

03:15.760 --> 03:17.000
Del!

03:20.680 --> 03:26.120
This came in with a Chesterfield
and a gross of electric toothbrushes
as a part-chop on a Vanden Plas.

03:26.200 --> 03:31.880
-Still, clean it up a bit, some new tyres.
-And a new engine, new body
and you got a nice little motor.

03:32.440 --> 03:36.560
-Is the 98,000 miles on the clock genuine?
-Shut up!

03:38.280 --> 03:43.280
Be honest, Boycie. I mean,
seriously, it's a bit of a pig!

03:45.520 --> 03:49.480
-What d'you want for 50 quid?
-Ah, I'll take that!

03:50.760 --> 03:53.480
Do you want a cheque or the old readies?

03:54.440 --> 03:58.480
-You would an' all, wouldn't ya?
-Certainly! Handsome, innit?

03:58.560 --> 03:59.680
Yeah.

03:59.840 --> 04:05.040
It's only E-type Jaguars and Sebastian Coe
that make me proud to be British!

04:05.200 --> 04:06.960
I know what you mean, Boycie.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.280
Why haven't you got this up front?

04:09.360 --> 04:14.400
It's not for sale, mate. I'm looking
for a place to hide it for a week.

04:14.480 --> 04:19.400
It's a birthday present.
I'm scared the wife'll see it.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.880
Spoil the surprise?

04:21.960 --> 04:25.480
Spoil everything!
It's for my bit-on-the-side!

04:27.120 --> 04:29.960
-Your what?
-His bit-on-the-side!

04:30.680 --> 04:36.560
Oh, never mind. It's so long since Rodney
had a bit-on-the-side, he didn't know
they'd moved it!

04:37.960 --> 04:40.960
-What are you hanging about! <i>Mon dieu!</i>
-What?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.720
You want to hide this for a week?

04:42.800 --> 04:46.800
We've got an empty garage on the estate.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.800
You're handy, Del.
It'd save me a lot of aggro.

04:51.800 --> 04:55.400
-Right, well, I owe you one then.
-Nah. Forget it, Boycie.

04:55.480 --> 05:02.240
If you can't do a pal a favour
without expecting something
in return... How much was that car?

05:08.480 --> 05:11.480
TYRES SCREECH

05:39.960 --> 05:42.120
Brakes a bit spongy, then?

05:42.920 --> 05:45.360
Brakes? What bloody brakes?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.840
It's a death-trap, Del!

05:49.000 --> 05:51.400
What d'you expect for 25 quid?

06:19.840 --> 06:22.360
-IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT
Your shock-absorber's gone.
-Well, it has now!

06:23.400 --> 06:25.440
-What's it like?
-What's what like?

06:25.520 --> 06:29.160
The car, ya dingo! D'you think
I meant your flamin' coffee?

06:29.240 --> 06:32.600
Oh! Well, it's... It's...

06:32.680 --> 06:36.160
-It's a bit overpriced.
-It's a bit overpriced, yeah.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.920
Says 23,000 on the clock. Is that genuine?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.280
Twenty three... Last time I looked
it was over...

06:42.360 --> 06:44.560
Twenty-two and a half thousand.

06:44.960 --> 06:50.720
I had the RAC do a 500-mile test on it.
Better safe than sorry, I always say.

06:51.360 --> 06:56.880
Beautiful, in't it?
<i>Son et lumière,</i> wouldn't you say?

06:56.960 --> 06:58.880
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

06:59.800 --> 07:06.000
Look at this. Where would you find
genuine leather upholstery like that
these days?

07:07.200 --> 07:11.880
Do you know that the East African gazelle
became an endangered species
for this model?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.680
A sacrifice well made, wouldn't you say?

07:13.800 --> 07:19.080
No, I can see you are an enthusiast.

07:19.160 --> 07:25.720
Don't give me that crap, mate!
I don't need no help from
any Cockney villain!

07:26.520 --> 07:29.160
Cockney villain?

07:29.480 --> 07:34.760
There's no need to be like that, sir.
After all, the British and the Australians
are cousins.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.320
If your great-grandad
hadn't been a bloody villain,
you could've been one of us!

07:39.400 --> 07:41.040
EXCLAIMS IN FRENCH

07:42.600 --> 07:46.200
Allow me to point out
the optional extras, sir.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.400
The anti-dazzle mirror.

07:48.480 --> 07:54.200
In here, we've got the old
one-speed wiper.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.400
And we've got automatic windows.

07:59.640 --> 08:06.160
And, of course, it comes complete
with a full two-weeks' MOT still to run.

08:07.120 --> 08:12.320
How many owners? Glad you asked.
It's only had the one owner from new

08:12.400 --> 08:14.120
and that was a vicar.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.560
-Vicar?
-A vicar.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.880
He used to use it to drive
to and from church on a Sunday.

08:20.960 --> 08:25.920
Oh, look... He's left his Bible
in the glove compartment!

08:27.400 --> 08:29.640
DEL WHISTLING

08:31.480 --> 08:34.400
MOCK AUSTRALIAN ACCENT:
As I was walkin'
through Earls Court,

08:34.480 --> 08:37.000
into a pub I was lured,

08:37.080 --> 08:43.200
where a nosey Pom said,
"Where you from?"
as I downed the amber fluid.

08:43.280 --> 08:49.120
I said, "Get it straight,
I'm an Aussie, mate!
An' I'm fixin' to get plastered,

08:49.200 --> 08:54.040
"But the beer is crook
and the birds all look
like you, you Pommy..." Grandad.

08:55.520 --> 09:00.080
-Cheers, Del Boy!
-Buy a crate of Odour-Eaters!

09:00.760 --> 09:02.600
Yeah, I've heard they're good.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.160
Bloody murder to swallow, though!

09:05.920 --> 09:09.120
'Ere, where's Peckham's conscience?

09:09.200 --> 09:14.240
He's in his room,
pinin' about that little fat bird.
Women...

09:16.120 --> 09:19.440
You wouldn't remember when I married
your grandmother?

09:23.160 --> 09:24.560
No.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.160
The first night, we was in bed and I,

09:28.760 --> 09:30.160
well, you know, Del.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.400
What?

09:33.000 --> 09:37.120
Well, doing what you do
when the lights are out.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.920
Holding a seance, was you?

09:42.680 --> 09:46.080
No! You know what I mean.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.920
Anyhow, right in the middle
of it,

09:51.040 --> 09:54.000
-do you know what she said to me?
-No, what?

09:54.400 --> 09:58.040
She said, "What do you fancy
for dinner tomorrow?"

10:00.880 --> 10:03.000
"What do you fancy
for dinner tomorrow?"

10:03.400 --> 10:04.720
Bad, innit?

10:06.520 --> 10:09.920
Bet that didn't happen to Omar Shariff.
Anyway, what did you say?

10:11.160 --> 10:13.160
Steak and kidney pudding.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.000
SARCASTIC
Isn't love wonderful?

10:17.920 --> 10:20.200
Look out, the room is full!

10:20.280 --> 10:22.160
Going to a fancy-dress party?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.880
No, I'm gonna do what Monica did.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.320
Going dancing with Micky Pearce?

10:27.400 --> 10:31.560
No, I'm gonna paint the town red!

10:31.640 --> 10:33.200
Going to Streatham?

10:33.280 --> 10:36.520
No, I'm going up West!

10:36.600 --> 10:39.160
-You, up West?
-Yeah!

10:39.240 --> 10:41.680
You'd need a bloody compass to find it!

10:41.760 --> 10:44.760
I'm one of the faces.

10:45.280 --> 10:51.240
Huh! Two halves
at the British Legion Club is like
a walk on the wild side to you!

10:52.680 --> 10:57.000
I'll lead me own life.
And what d'you mean "fancy-dress"?

10:57.360 --> 11:01.520
Well, why are you hittin' the West End
looking like a praying mantis?

11:03.360 --> 11:09.520
Lay off! Is that the money from
the death-trap you sold to Skippy?

11:09.600 --> 11:12.120
There was nothing wrong with it!

11:12.200 --> 11:16.960
No? The oil light stayed on,
the steering didn't take you where you
wanted to and the brakes didn't work...

11:17.040 --> 11:20.840
Minor faults. And I fixed the oil light.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.320
-You changed the oil?
-No, I took the bulb out!

11:25.520 --> 11:27.000
Great!

11:27.440 --> 11:33.000
I never thought you'd stoop to
selling instant motorway madness!

11:33.080 --> 11:34.760
Oh, shut up, you tart!

11:34.840 --> 11:39.680
That money is immoral!
It's nothing more than blood money!

11:41.280 --> 11:45.800
-Is it? All right, then.
-Oi, half of that's mine!

11:45.880 --> 11:52.040
Ah-ha! See? That's the mentality
of your spoon-fed student-type!

11:52.400 --> 11:55.360
They spout about humanity,

11:55.440 --> 12:02.160
yet in a fight for a torn fiver,
they make Genghis Khan
look like a pacifist!

12:03.160 --> 12:07.520
I was stating that half of it is mine.
That don't mean I want it.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.160
Oh, I see!

12:10.880 --> 12:12.640
Don't want this then, Rodney?

12:15.880 --> 12:16.760
No.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.680
Oh, what a bind!
I'll have to spend it all meself!

12:20.760 --> 12:24.400
-Still going out, are you, Rodney?
-Er...yeah.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.520
D'you fancy tagging along to my clubs?

12:29.600 --> 12:31.360
No.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.760
No. But if you need the company,
I'll come.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.000
Me? I've got hundreds of friends!

12:37.080 --> 12:41.600
Oh? That's all right then, innit?
Good, yeah. Yeah...

12:42.440 --> 12:44.960
There's the cats from the evening class.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.320
Cats? You going dancin' or rattin'?

12:49.640 --> 12:51.080
Rattin'! I like that!

12:51.160 --> 12:57.680
It means ravers, Grandad!
These guys really live it up, Del,
and I mean live.

12:58.920 --> 13:02.600
Yeah...there's...Dave...an' Bob...

13:04.720 --> 13:09.840
Mike an'...Tony...George...

13:09.920 --> 13:11.800
-Jim.
-Jim!

13:12.240 --> 13:14.080
-Why not give them a bell?
-Who?

13:14.160 --> 13:17.760
The beautiful people from your classes.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.240
They're not on the phone.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.760
All these swingers ain't got a phone?

13:22.840 --> 13:27.360
All right!
Well, are you coming with me, then?

13:27.840 --> 13:32.840
-No, I'll pop down the Nag's Head
for a light ale later on.
-Oh.

13:32.920 --> 13:37.920
Well, your loss, Del. I'll tell you
all about it in the morning, then.

13:38.640 --> 13:39.800
All right.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.920
-Are you coming or not, then?
-No!

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Okay, then. Well, here I go!

13:47.080 --> 13:49.600
Yeah. See ya, then.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.840
-I'll give the birds your regards,
shall I?
-Yeah, that's t'riffic.

13:55.320 --> 13:59.360
Right...
Well, we have take-off!

14:04.280 --> 14:05.600
DOOR CLOSES

14:05.960 --> 14:08.480
Make up your mind, Del!
Are you coming or not?

14:08.560 --> 14:12.520
Bloody kids!
Can't even enjoy themselves today!

14:12.600 --> 14:15.600
All right, come on, Soppy!

14:15.680 --> 14:20.400
Well, you can tag along,
if you can pay for yourself.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.840
Don't worry, I've got the money!
I've got the van keys an' all.

14:24.920 --> 14:28.440
You go easy on the iron jelloids!

14:28.520 --> 14:32.280
We're not going up West in a 3-wheel van?

14:32.360 --> 14:36.360
-I ain't walking!
-But your image!

14:36.440 --> 14:39.080
You're very suave and debonair.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.720
I suppose I am a bit ostentatious.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.560
Sit low and no-one will see you arrive.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.160
But I want people to see me arrive!

14:51.240 --> 14:53.960
In a 3-wheel van?
Still, we got no choice, have we?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.080
Yes, we have.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.880
We can take Boycie's E-type Jaguar!

14:58.960 --> 15:02.800
Are you sure? Upon your shoulders
be it, son. Let's go.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.840
Rodney!

15:21.240 --> 15:25.360
Is it always as dark in 'ere
or they having a dummy run
for a coal-miners' convention?

15:27.240 --> 15:31.760
-I dunno!
-You said this was
one of your regular clubs.

15:32.480 --> 15:36.920
-I exaggerated.
-How many times have you been here?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.800
Never.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.480
Eh? Why did you bring us in here?

15:41.560 --> 15:45.680
-It looked okay from the outside.
-"It looked okay from the outside."

15:45.760 --> 15:50.240
That's what the Christians said
about the Colosseum! You berk!

15:53.080 --> 15:55.600
-Not much action for a nightclub,
is there?
-No.

15:55.680 --> 16:01.400
But then it's only half past seven!
It's the last time
I come out with you, Rodney!

16:01.480 --> 16:04.880
-Promise, you moaning git?
-Watch it!

16:07.200 --> 16:09.960
Ah... Oi! <i>Garçon la petit pois!</i>

16:11.680 --> 16:14.080
-Oh! <i>Parlez-vous Francais?</i>
<i>-Jawohl!</i>

16:14.160 --> 16:17.400
Yes! What can I get for you?

16:18.480 --> 16:20.480
I'd like a Caribbean Stallion.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.560
Wouldn't we all, dear?

16:24.840 --> 16:28.560
-What is it?
-It's... What is it?

16:28.640 --> 16:33.640
It's an exotic cocktail,
created for the jet set.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.360
Roger Moore drank one
in <i>Live And Let Die.</i>

16:36.440 --> 16:39.200
SCOFFS I wouldn't put anything past her!

16:42.600 --> 16:44.400
Well, you'd better write this down.

16:45.120 --> 16:51.240
You want a shot of tequila,
and a shot of coconut rum,
and one of Creme de Menthe.

16:51.520 --> 16:57.040
Then you want a smidgen of Campari
with a hint of Angostura's Bitters.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.320
Top it up with grapefruit juice

17:00.400 --> 17:03.520
then you shake it. Do not stir.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.160
Pour that slowly over broken ice,

17:06.240 --> 17:11.280
garnish with a slice of orange,
lime and seasonal fruits.

17:11.360 --> 17:16.920
Add a decorative plastic umbrella,
two translucent straws, and <i>voila!</i>

17:17.000 --> 17:19.240
Right. And for you?

17:19.720 --> 17:21.440
Half a lager, please.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.080
Half a lager.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.560
Reg Varney drank one of them
in <i>Holiday On The Buses!</i>

17:33.800 --> 17:36.240
Is he a bit...funny?

17:37.600 --> 17:38.680
I dunno.

17:38.760 --> 17:42.240
Yeah, he's definitely a bandit, that one.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.640
Tonight, we dance with our backs
to the wall, Rodney.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.640
I wonder what Monica's doing now?

17:50.720 --> 17:53.720
Ask Micky Pearce.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.800
I don't talk to him no more.

17:56.520 --> 18:01.960
Look, I'm your brother.
You can tell me. What broke you two up?

18:02.080 --> 18:04.720
I found out he was dating Monica!

18:04.800 --> 18:07.800
Not you and Micky bloody Pearce!
You and the fat girl!

18:07.880 --> 18:12.480
Oh. Well...
She thought I was weird.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.240
Well, not so much weird.
More...warped.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.160
Warped?

18:20.240 --> 18:21.400
Yeah...

18:21.480 --> 18:24.280
See, I've got this fantasy.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.480
Uniforms. They turn me on.

18:29.640 --> 18:33.640
Uniforms?
You mean, like postmen an' that?

18:35.480 --> 18:41.760
No, women in uniforms!
Nurses, air hostesses and my favourite...

18:42.720 --> 18:44.160
Policewomen.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.640
Policewomen? But they nick ya!

18:50.600 --> 18:56.320
What you're trying to tell me is that
this Monica bird didn't go a bundle
on this dressing-up idea?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.480
I didn't tell her.
I tried to do it without her knowing.

18:59.560 --> 19:03.280
You dressed her up as Juliet Bravo
without her twiggin'?

19:03.360 --> 19:06.360
No, I was gonna do it gradual.

19:06.840 --> 19:13.520
For her birthday last week, I bought her
one of them blue serge suits,
and I'd already got her the hat,

19:13.760 --> 19:15.760
white with navy blue peak.

19:16.040 --> 19:22.280
For Valentine's Day, I was going to get
her black stockings and walking brogues
and for Christmas...

19:22.360 --> 19:25.360
You was gonna get a whistle
and some handcuffs!

19:26.640 --> 19:32.360
You was lucky she chucked you!
Them Panda cars cost a bomb!

19:34.960 --> 19:40.200
And Monica's right.
You're a pervo. That is immoral.
D'you know that?

19:40.280 --> 19:44.680
Immoral? Today, you sold a clapped-out
Batmobile with no brakes!

19:44.760 --> 19:46.720
There's nothing wrong with that motor,
it went, didn't it?

19:46.800 --> 19:52.520
Yeah, only it didn't stop.
You're like a cigarette rep
joining the Festival of Light.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.960
"Die from my profit, but don't play
with yourself in between!"

19:58.680 --> 20:01.160
Oh, yeah, all right, Rodney.

20:01.240 --> 20:06.840
I don't mean the geezer no 'arm.
I'll pay to have his brakes repaired.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.760
That's good. Tell you what I'll do.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.800
You'll forget about policewomen?

20:11.880 --> 20:14.040
No. I'll accept my 50% of the profit!

20:14.120 --> 20:16.960
Oh, my cup runneth over.

20:17.040 --> 20:23.200
Half a lager for sir,
and a Caribbean Stallion for Mandingo.

20:25.920 --> 20:31.080
-That'll be £7.
-Blimey, I can get that for 3 quid
where I come from!

20:31.160 --> 20:35.800
Oh, you're from Jersey, are you?
Enjoy your stay.

20:37.080 --> 20:43.160
-Jersey?
-The barman asked if you'd
like some evaporated milk with that.

20:44.240 --> 20:48.360
-Tell the barman to get stuffed!
-Thank you, sir.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.280
Thank you, sir!

20:51.560 --> 20:53.840
-Del... Del!
-What?

20:58.720 --> 21:03.680
No, it's only 7:40.
If we pull 'em now, we've gotta
buy 'em drinks all night.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.640
We could take 'em back to the flat.

21:05.720 --> 21:10.520
That's an idea! I've got 24 litres
of that Yugoslavian Riesling!

21:10.600 --> 21:13.680
We'll pop Grandpa in the meter cupboard!

21:13.760 --> 21:18.960
Yeah! Go on! You can charm a tortoise
out of a shell!

21:20.440 --> 21:25.960
Okay. Now you, look, learn and listen.
Right?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.600
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

21:44.320 --> 21:46.600
Okay, drink up. We're leaving.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.320
You are great! You're the last
miracle left on this earth!

21:50.400 --> 21:53.640
-Shut up and drink up.
-Couple of ravers, eh?

21:54.160 --> 21:55.560
They're a couple of geezers!

22:21.560 --> 22:25.120
DISCO MUSIC PLAYING

22:39.400 --> 22:41.520
-I'm sorry!
-What?

22:43.480 --> 22:45.680
I said I'm sorry.

22:46.200 --> 22:50.400
-Shut up!
-I didn't know it was that sort of place!

22:50.480 --> 22:55.720
Tonight, I've joined a gay club,
discovered my brother's a pervo,

22:55.800 --> 22:59.520
and had a close encounter
with two dockers in drag!

23:00.160 --> 23:06.160
You better not tell anybody about this,
Rodney! I've got my macho reputation
to uphold!

23:06.240 --> 23:11.880
I'm warning you. One person,
just one person calls me
the Naked Civil Servant and you're dead!

23:11.960 --> 23:17.520
I'm hardly gonna brag that my brother
tried to date two transvestites.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.880
Me? It was you clocked 'em!

23:20.960 --> 23:25.280
You... Just shut up!
Shut up, will ya?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.840
Del!

23:40.920 --> 23:44.600
-Shut up!
-Corner table, to your left.
A couple of birds.

23:44.680 --> 23:49.560
It's probably Hinge and Bracket
out having a pint!

23:50.440 --> 23:54.920
These are definitely feminine.
All the lumps in the right places!

23:55.040 --> 23:58.640
-Yeah? Where?
-Here.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.280
No, you wally! I mean where here!

24:06.720 --> 24:11.600
Yes. That'll definitely suit me.
Right, come on. Bellies in!

24:11.680 --> 24:16.120
Let's just be ourselves this time!
Don't try and put me down!

24:16.200 --> 24:18.880
-All right. Don't you say I'm 35 !
-All right!

24:18.960 --> 24:20.920
Come on, into action.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.800
Oops!

24:25.880 --> 24:32.640
I just dropped the keys
to the E-type Jag.
It's not mine, it's his!

24:33.400 --> 24:36.120
-Yeah, it's my car. Cheers, Del.
-It's all right.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.840
-Using it while my Ferrari's
being serviced!
-He's 35!

24:41.960 --> 24:45.600
Sit down, will ya? Sit down,
Rodney. Keep your brains warm!

24:45.680 --> 24:48.600
Mind if we join you, girls?

24:48.680 --> 24:51.000
Good. This is my brother, Rodney,

24:51.080 --> 24:55.000
and I am Del. That's short
for Derek. Nice name, eh?

24:55.280 --> 25:01.000
-Yep. I'm Nicky, this is Michelle. Hi.
-They're nice names.

25:03.080 --> 25:07.480
-Not as nice as Derek, though.
-No, not a patch on Derek!

25:09.120 --> 25:10.560
Er...

25:12.840 --> 25:14.920
D'you come 'ere often?

25:15.880 --> 25:18.960
I don't believe you!
I don't believe you!

25:19.440 --> 25:24.160
-Yes. Do you?
-We don't come to London much.

25:24.240 --> 25:28.040
-Where are you from?
-Em... Peckham!

25:28.160 --> 25:30.320
Originally from Peckham,

25:30.400 --> 25:34.720
but we spend a lot of time abroad
for tax reasons,

25:34.800 --> 25:37.640
on the international professional
tennis circuit.

25:37.720 --> 25:42.800
-Del!
-He's a player and I'm his manager.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.560
You must've heard of Rodney!
The sporting press call him "Hot Rod".

25:49.640 --> 25:52.520
-What's the surname?
-Trotter.

25:52.600 --> 25:58.560
-Doesn't ring a bell!
-No, we tend to stick to the
American tournaments.

25:59.320 --> 26:04.600
-Do you ever play Wimbledon?
-No, but we did the Miami Open.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.520
Really? You're not very tanned!

26:08.480 --> 26:11.440
No, it was an indoor tournament.

26:11.520 --> 26:17.840
Yeah, amazing, innit?
They call it the Miami Open
and then they hold it indoors!

26:18.800 --> 26:20.800
That's the Yanks for you, innit?

26:20.880 --> 26:23.240
Anyway, we...

26:23.320 --> 26:29.360
We can't complain 'cause he won it!
Beat Jimmy Connolly in the finals.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.160
Don't you mean Jimmy Connors?

26:33.240 --> 26:37.320
No, he knocked him out
in the first round!

26:37.400 --> 26:42.160
-Actually, we're in London to get
Rod a new bat.
-It's a racquet!

26:42.240 --> 26:45.360
Bloody is, the prices they charge!

26:46.040 --> 26:51.040
Also, we thought it'd be an idea
to give us some practice on grass.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.520
In the States, they use astroturf!

26:54.600 --> 26:57.760
-What do you prefer, Rodney?
-Pardon?

26:57.840 --> 27:03.840
-Do you prefer astroturf or grass?
-Dunno. I've never smoked astroturf!

27:11.640 --> 27:14.160
You wally!

27:16.160 --> 27:21.760
Nah, nah. It's, er... We're not
really professional tennis players!

27:21.960 --> 27:26.680
-We're just havin' a laugh!
-We know! What do you really do?

27:26.760 --> 27:30.040
We're Concorde pilots!

27:37.320 --> 27:39.600
Light me up a cigar, Rodders.

27:41.280 --> 27:46.440
-We have struck gold there, Del Boy!
-It's the Klondike, my son! The Klondike!

27:46.800 --> 27:51.920
It's every bloke's dream, innit?
Meetin' a couple of sorts
with their own pad in Chelsea.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.640
I hope it's a penthouse.
I'm a penthouse sort of person.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.600
If we see them next Friday, perhaps
we can stay for the weekend.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.680
-Yeah, watch <i>Match Of The Day!</i>
-We won't have to spend much, eh?

28:07.920 --> 28:10.440
Won't have to spend much.

28:10.600 --> 28:17.520
Honestly, Rodney, when it comes
down to it, you are completely
devoid of any <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

28:18.600 --> 28:24.720
These aren't your two halves of Stingo,
some pork scratchings
and Bob's yer uncle type! No, no!

28:25.600 --> 28:28.280
No, we'll take 'em to a Berni Inn.

28:28.360 --> 28:33.240
Yes! I'll bow to your experience
and wallet there, Del.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.160
Where's their phone number?

28:35.240 --> 28:38.800
-She wrote it on my cigar pack.
-Ace!

28:40.080 --> 28:43.480
-Wh-what cigar pack's that, then, Del?
-The one I just gave ya!

28:45.240 --> 28:46.800
-Del...
-Yeah.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.000
-You know that cigar pack?
-Yeah.

28:50.280 --> 28:52.480
I threw it out the window!

28:52.560 --> 28:55.080
Oh, well, that's all right...

28:58.160 --> 29:00.120
You what!

29:01.840 --> 29:04.520
You pranny!

29:04.600 --> 29:06.520

29:14.240 --> 29:18.440
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
I just do not believe it.

29:19.680 --> 29:25.040
-You've smashed up Boycie's E-type Jaguar.
-Me? You was drivin' it!

29:25.120 --> 29:28.640
Don't play bloody word games with me!

29:34.000 --> 29:36.880
What is your game, pal?
Are you blind or something?

29:36.960 --> 29:41.040
I'm really sorry about that, mate,
but these brakes are a bit dicky.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.400
You!

29:46.360 --> 29:50.960
