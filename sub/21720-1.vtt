06:15.508 --> 06:17.409
Can you tell us your name?

06:24.050 --> 06:26.551
Do you understand me?

06:29.956 --> 06:31.490
Yes.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.696
I understand.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.007
Where am I?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.150
You are safe now.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.592
Do you remember what happened
to you?

07:10.963 --> 07:12.631
Is this a hospital?

07:18.671 --> 07:20.639
It is like a hospital.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.842
I don't understand.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.598
<i> Hey. It's me, Kate.</i>

07:46.600 --> 07:49.668
<i> Got the new camera</i>
<i> and it's ready to go to Japan.</i>

07:51.237 --> 07:55.006
<i> So, my boyfriend is flying in</i>
<i> from San Francisco.</i>

07:56.142 --> 07:59.478
<i> I wish he was on my flight,</i>
<i> but that's okay.</i>

07:59.480 --> 08:02.013
<i> I need to sleep on the plane</i>
<i> anyway.</i>

08:02.748 --> 08:05.550
<i> And I don't know how Chris</i>
<i>is going to react to traveling.</i>

08:08.888 --> 08:11.756
<i> So, Chris is</i>
<i> one of my closest childhood</i>
<i> friends.</i>

08:11.758 --> 08:13.892
<i> We went to kindergarten</i>
<i> together.</i>

08:13.894 --> 08:16.495
<i> And what's cool is</i>
<i> he speaks some Japanese,</i>

08:16.497 --> 08:19.998
<i> and he really needs this trip.</i>

08:21.167 --> 08:23.134
<i> He needs some good luck.</i>

08:23.870 --> 08:25.237
<i> Good mojo.</i>

08:29.509 --> 08:32.177
<i> He actually</i>
<i> had a breakdown earlier this</i>
<i> year.</i>

08:33.044 --> 08:36.948
<i> His brother died in a horrific</i>
<i> accident.</i>

08:39.553 --> 08:42.854
<i> You know,</i>
<i> we've been talking a lot and</i>
<i> I...</i>

08:43.990 --> 08:45.624
<i> I think he's doing okay.</i>

08:48.595 --> 08:51.596
<i> So I'm doing my thesis</i>
<i> on religious studies,</i>

08:51.598 --> 08:55.267
<i> specifically how religion</i>
<i> changes myth and vice versa,</i>

08:55.269 --> 08:57.969
<i> and I want to photograph</i>
<i> obscure shinto shrines</i>

08:57.971 --> 09:00.672
<i> and Buddhist temples in rural</i>
<i> Japan.</i>

09:05.678 --> 09:07.112
Do you know this woman?

09:09.582 --> 09:11.716
Where did you get this?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.885
He asked where you got this
material.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.065
Yeah, is it nice?

09:29.201 --> 09:30.835
All right, I don't know. Hold
on.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.305
Excuse me, how long 'til we get
there?

09:37.710 --> 09:39.177
Ten minutes.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.180
You hear that?

09:44.951 --> 09:46.184
Okay, see ya soon.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.720
I love you too.

09:49.622 --> 09:50.822
Bye.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.127
I can't believe you still
haven't met.

09:58.731 --> 10:01.166
Has it really been that long
since I saw you?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.735
Yeah. Goes by in a blink.

10:06.739 --> 10:07.973
Well, I'm really glad you came.

10:09.642 --> 10:10.976
Me too.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.009
Nice to finally meet you.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.077
I was beginning to think you
didn't exist.

10:49.849 --> 10:50.949
- You good?
- - Yeah.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.217
All right.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.950
He's, uh...

12:00.152 --> 12:02.120
He's not at all like I imagined.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.356
What did you imagine?

12:07.126 --> 12:08.126
I don't know.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.862
Not him.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.733
<i> You don't like him.</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:17.001
<i> Yeah, sure. Sure I do. Yeah.</i>

12:17.003 --> 12:19.838
<i> I like him. He seems fine.</i>

12:21.140 --> 12:21.139
<i> No you don't.</i>

12:21.141 --> 12:24.075
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.216
Like, you two have been friends
for how long?

12:34.019 --> 12:36.521
I just can't believe
he's never tried anything.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.391
Yeah, well, not everyone is
like you.

12:44.296 --> 12:45.396
<i> If you say so.</i>

12:50.136 --> 12:51.369
Are you jealous?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.005
No.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.208
I'm not.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.850
Should I be jealous?

13:06.786 --> 13:07.852
'Cause I'll be jealous.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.995
So, how'd you come to learn
Japanese?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.397
Always wanted to come here.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.332
Is it what you expected?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.068
So far.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.504
You know,
if we had trains like this in
America

13:59.506 --> 14:01.206
I would not travel any other
way.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.413
You two have been friends for a
long time.

14:12.618 --> 14:15.086
I've never had that kind of
relationship
with a woman.

14:16.989 --> 14:18.389
What are you guys talking about?

14:19.291 --> 14:20.291
You.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.436
You guys want anything
from the dining car?

14:32.538 --> 14:33.872
I'm good. Thanks.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.141
Kate?

14:38.577 --> 14:40.111
She's good.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.955
So, this is our room.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.696
Feeling like a third wheel.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.968
It's only for one night.

15:59.358 --> 16:01.559
Are we looking
for anything in particular,
or...

16:03.228 --> 16:04.562
Babe, how about this?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.434
Exactly.

16:14.239 --> 16:16.374
Wow. Come look at this temple.

16:17.209 --> 16:19.978
Chris? Can you read this?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.453
Looks like some kind of journal.

16:28.455 --> 16:32.724
It's a kitsune.
A shapeshifter. Half woman,
half fox.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.726
Do you think we could find this
place?

16:34.728 --> 16:36.060
I think so.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.140
Oh...

16:49.142 --> 16:50.274
How much is it?

16:50.276 --> 16:51.743
No, she's asking where we got
it.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.516
Sorry, not for sale.

16:59.718 --> 17:03.755
- Well, she said it's not for
sale, so...
- Okay, I got that.

17:03.757 --> 17:08.092
Ask her how much it is,
how much she wants for it.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.662
Leave now. Closed.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.442
Do you think you said
something to insult her?

17:24.444 --> 17:25.777
- Kate.
- What?

17:25.779 --> 17:26.743
No.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.479
No, I, I mean by accident.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.515
You know? Maybe he said
the wrong word or something.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.584
No. I didn't.

17:36.822 --> 17:39.824
We'll find it online. All right?

17:39.826 --> 17:41.526
Come on.

17:47.099 --> 17:50.068
Babe. Can you please
explain to your viewers

17:50.070 --> 17:52.537
why you won't be joining us
on this evening's adventure?

17:53.439 --> 17:54.739
Jet lag.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.508
There you have it, ladies and
gentleman.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.410
Tune in next week
to discover how our heroes,

17:59.412 --> 18:02.313
Chris and James,
got themselves into trouble.

18:50.562 --> 18:51.562
Who is this woman?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.436
Who is this woman?

18:59.571 --> 19:02.607
That is a good question.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.298
Hello?

19:40.445 --> 19:41.679
The book.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.243
Okay, okay, okay.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.782
A whiskey.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.384
Okay.

21:23.415 --> 21:24.949
It's unlucky place.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.886
Very unlucky.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.789
Ah. I have a friend.

21:32.391 --> 21:35.293
She's
interested in temples and
wants to start with this one.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.799
This was not the start.
This was the end.

21:46.672 --> 21:47.872
This temple.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.611
It will make you... sick.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.894
Sick.

22:12.998 --> 22:17.068
Do not go there.
Many other temples in Japan.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.079
I'm, I'm sorry.

24:36.842 --> 24:38.542
How did you get this?

24:40.145 --> 24:42.713
It's a long story.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.751
Mmm, my head.

24:49.621 --> 24:49.620
Wow.

24:49.622 --> 24:52.490
Sorry I left you so
early last night.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.026
Looked like you were having a
great time.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.962
James said you made a friend.

24:58.897 --> 25:00.264
A friend?

25:09.508 --> 25:12.977
Oh, you know
that temple inside the book?

25:15.046 --> 25:16.080
I can find it.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.715
Doubt you can find
this place in any travel guide.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.850
Yeah. You sure that's such a
good thing?

26:48.273 --> 26:49.940
Oh.

26:58.883 --> 27:00.951
That went well.

27:56.374 --> 27:56.373
What's he say?

27:56.375 --> 28:00.010
Um, he's asking why we came
here.

28:04.416 --> 28:04.415
What's he saying?

28:04.417 --> 28:07.351
Um, he's asking
why we came to his village.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.909
Okay, okay.
He's saying this guy, hitoshi,

28:31.911 --> 28:35.079
went up to the temple
and he had visions or something.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.821
Holding his eyes.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.433
Okay.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.001
What is it. What is he doing?

28:58.003 --> 29:01.238
Um, I don't,
i don't understand him, so...

29:08.780 --> 29:10.380
<i> Mucho arigato.</i>

30:41.306 --> 30:42.973
Hey, we're just going
to go for a walk, okay?

30:42.975 --> 30:44.341
Yeah.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.444
How great is this place?

30:47.446 --> 30:49.213
It's perfect.

30:51.082 --> 30:52.382
See ya later?

34:17.188 --> 34:18.621
You are American.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.456
You speak English?

34:21.192 --> 34:23.527
It's been a long time.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.532
They say you are here to visit
the temple.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.504
The man in the village, he
said, uh...

34:35.206 --> 34:36.840
You lost your sight there...

34:43.848 --> 34:47.818
So, what's with all this...
Mystery about the temple?

34:52.223 --> 34:53.657
What happened there?

34:56.393 --> 34:59.162
Some children disappeared.

35:01.499 --> 35:03.700
They had been playing in the
mountain.

35:04.769 --> 35:10.707
It became night,
and the children had not
returned.

35:13.644 --> 35:17.814
The search party
discovered a man living at the
temple.

35:20.384 --> 35:23.286
He was a monk. A wanderer.

35:24.388 --> 35:27.557
They questioned him
about the missing children.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.897
But his answers were not
believed.

35:36.367 --> 35:37.901
So, then what happened?

35:39.570 --> 35:41.471
They killed the monk.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.875
The children were never found.

35:53.284 --> 35:56.186
Every year we burn candles,

35:56.188 --> 35:59.456
and pray that the children will
return.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.393
Someone was there, I...

37:15.366 --> 37:16.333
Nobody.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.637
Enjoy the show?

37:27.378 --> 37:29.346
I'm sorry I woke you guys.

38:12.823 --> 38:16.326
<i> We could feel it.
</i> <i> As we got closer it knew we</i> <i> were coming.</i>

38:20.331 --> 38:21.598
<i> We should have gone back.</i>

39:18.622 --> 39:21.691
Who helped you find the temple?

39:24.628 --> 39:28.498
The boy, seita.

39:32.870 --> 39:36.373
All right. Isn't that something?

39:39.043 --> 39:40.677
It's terrible. I hate it.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.079
It's just a spider, baby.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.683
Yeah, it looks like
it eats birds or small children.

39:52.990 --> 39:56.559
Oh!

40:17.548 --> 40:19.149
It's so quiet up here.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.018
I was just thinking the same
thing.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.088
It's cold, though.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.890
Hold up.

40:26.892 --> 40:27.891
What?

40:27.893 --> 40:28.858
Here.

40:30.127 --> 40:33.129
What? No. Honestly, I'm okay.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.841
Thanks.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.022
What do you think
the monk did to those kids?

40:59.024 --> 41:00.690
I don't want to think about it.

41:03.127 --> 41:06.596
I can't tell you how many
shirts of mine
have mysteriously gone missing.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.898
Never to be seen again.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.087
I gotta take a leak.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.089
Yeah, you do that.

41:33.091 --> 41:34.891
Have fun!

42:16.700 --> 42:20.270
Hey. Let's go find him.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.139
James!

42:23.941 --> 42:25.275
James!

42:28.546 --> 42:29.812
Hey.

42:29.814 --> 42:30.980
Hey, where were you?

42:31.549 --> 42:33.616
I'll show you. Come on.

42:43.828 --> 42:45.962
How cool is this?

42:45.964 --> 42:48.898
It's an old mine.
I bet it goes on for miles.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.100
Who's coming with me?

42:52.937 --> 42:54.971
How about on the way back down?

42:54.973 --> 42:58.741
Oh, come on.
Where's that spirit of
adventure?

42:59.243 --> 43:01.644
I want to find the temple first.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.580
I mean...

43:03.582 --> 43:05.114
We might not be able to find it
again.

43:05.950 --> 43:07.817
We'll leave something
on the path to mark it.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.162
Fine. Fine.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.367
You sure, babe?

43:24.369 --> 43:26.202
Gift from my stepmother.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.879
Hey, look. It's the statue from
the book.

43:36.881 --> 43:38.114
We found it!

43:54.164 --> 43:56.766
We must be close.
Chris, what do they call her?

43:59.169 --> 44:02.271
This is a kitsune.
A shapeshifter protects the temple.

46:20.911 --> 46:22.345
Bit of a letdown.

46:39.296 --> 46:41.063
Look like little graves.

46:41.565 --> 46:43.800
Maybe the monk-man
made them for his victims.

46:45.969 --> 46:47.370
Was that supposed to be a joke?

46:48.338 --> 46:49.505
I know. Right? I'm sorry.

46:49.507 --> 46:52.909
I thought it was, then I said
it.

46:54.813 --> 46:58.481
We should probably get out
of here soon. The sun's
starting to go down.

46:59.950 --> 47:01.417
We still have time.

47:02.553 --> 47:04.153
Look, I know you're not into
this.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.355
- That's not true.
- It isn't?

47:06.357 --> 47:09.826
Look, I just... I don't want
to walk down the mountain in
the dark.

47:09.828 --> 47:11.460
We do have flashlights.

47:11.962 --> 47:14.430
True. I just don't want
to have to use them.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.102
Okay.

47:22.206 --> 47:23.840
Hey.

47:26.109 --> 47:27.376
I love you.

47:28.245 --> 47:29.879
I love you too.

48:10.254 --> 48:11.520
James?

48:30.307 --> 48:33.109
I thought I saw...

48:34.011 --> 48:36.279
- Saw what?
- I don't know, just...

48:38.282 --> 48:40.349
You're right.
It's getting dark. We should go.

48:41.318 --> 48:41.317
We can always come
back tomorrow.

48:41.319 --> 48:45.454
No, I don't want to, i
just... I want to find
Chris and I want to go.

49:17.487 --> 49:18.487
Chris!

49:20.324 --> 49:21.257
Yeah?

49:26.363 --> 49:27.730
Chris?

49:28.398 --> 49:30.366
Grab a flashlight. Grab a
flashlight.

49:31.068 --> 49:32.101
Chris!

49:35.639 --> 49:36.706
Hold it.

49:44.448 --> 49:45.381
Is he breathing?

49:45.383 --> 49:47.249
Yeah. Yeah, he's breathing.

49:47.251 --> 49:48.217
What do we do?

49:50.355 --> 49:51.754
Oh, Jesus. Thank god.

49:54.491 --> 49:56.592
Something pulled me through the
floor.

49:58.595 --> 50:00.663
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

50:01.999 --> 50:04.066
We're just going to have to
wait here,

50:04.068 --> 50:05.601
make ourselves comfortable,

50:05.603 --> 50:07.269
- and go down for help
in the morning.

50:07.271 --> 50:08.571
- No, I'm not spending
the night here.

50:08.573 --> 50:10.072
Yeah? What do you suggest?

50:10.674 --> 50:12.308
Let's get you out of here.

50:37.567 --> 50:39.101
I'm going to take a walk.

50:41.038 --> 50:44.140
A little moonlight stroll.
Care to join me?

50:46.476 --> 50:48.144
We should stay here.

50:49.146 --> 50:50.546
He's good. You're good, right?

50:56.453 --> 50:58.120
Okay.

50:58.122 --> 50:59.688
I'll be back in a few.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.359
Be careful.

51:03.361 --> 51:04.627
Yep.

51:08.698 --> 51:10.800
He's going for help
first thing in the morning.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.202
Okay?

51:15.572 --> 51:17.506
He's not what I expected.

51:19.843 --> 51:21.811
He said the same thing about
you.

51:24.247 --> 51:25.414
I like him.

51:28.218 --> 51:29.418
You do?

51:32.089 --> 51:33.322
Yeah.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.167
What do your parents think?

51:46.336 --> 51:48.571
Mom's undecided.

51:50.240 --> 51:53.542
Dad keeps trying to set me up
with some golf pro at his club.

51:56.379 --> 51:58.614
- No ulterior motives there.

52:12.662 --> 52:14.196
I never told him.

52:15.398 --> 52:16.699
Never told him what?

52:20.370 --> 52:21.704
About his baby.

52:26.376 --> 52:27.843
So you're the only one who
knows.

52:29.579 --> 52:31.747
What made you think of that
right now?

52:33.750 --> 52:35.417
I don't know.

52:41.525 --> 52:44.894
There were these... little
grave markers.

52:48.431 --> 52:49.832
You cold?

52:50.700 --> 52:51.901
I'm okay.

52:52.702 --> 52:54.236
Okay.

52:59.176 --> 53:01.677
- I'm going to tell him when we
get back.
- Tell me what?

53:03.313 --> 53:04.880
Can, can you point that
somewhere else?

53:10.954 --> 53:12.922
- What was it you were going to
tell me?

53:12.924 --> 53:14.857
- Nothing. I wasn't talking
about you.

53:16.726 --> 53:17.826
Never mind.

53:19.296 --> 53:20.963
I think I got a pretty good
idea.

53:26.436 --> 53:27.736
James.

53:30.340 --> 53:31.540
James.

54:10.580 --> 54:13.549
No, wait. What are you going to
do?

54:13.551 --> 54:16.385
Where are you going? James!
James!

54:23.760 --> 54:25.694
I'm going to go back to the
village.

54:25.696 --> 54:27.730
Okay. You've got all the food
and water

54:27.732 --> 54:29.665
- you need here in my bag.
- No.

54:29.667 --> 54:31.400
I'll send someone in the
morning.

54:41.812 --> 54:42.911
I told him.

54:47.384 --> 54:48.951
We're going to need some more
firewood.

54:48.953 --> 54:51.020
It's okay.
Why don't we just go back
inside...

54:52.957 --> 54:54.456
Fine.

54:57.060 --> 54:58.627
I'll be right back.

55:24.954 --> 55:26.322
Go fuck yourself.

56:00.490 --> 56:02.057
No, please.

56:02.059 --> 56:03.726
Come on, come on!

56:04.494 --> 56:07.629
Oh... no.

56:44.033 --> 56:45.701
Flashlight died.

56:47.937 --> 56:49.705
This place isn't right.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.300
No.

58:58.302 --> 58:59.968
You gotta be kidding me.

59:16.819 --> 59:18.086
James?

59:18.088 --> 59:19.688
What's the matter?

59:21.591 --> 59:22.925
What are you doing?

59:23.593 --> 59:26.194
Kate. Wait.

59:27.664 --> 59:28.730
He needs me.

59:32.969 --> 59:34.036
Kate!

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.707
Aaah!

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:06.361
James...

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:57.779
Hello?

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.455
Hello?

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:00.328
Hello?

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:12.374
Hello?

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.365
Let me help you!

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:47.035
James!

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:57.712
Help!

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:02.550
Help me!

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.258
Please, someone help!

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.582
There's no way out.

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:29.237
Do you know why you are here?

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.643
We're trying to find a miss
Thomas.

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:41.349
Kate.

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.591
Christopher.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.496
What happened to her?

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.473
Why is seita here?

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.221
The boy from the village.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:30.497
He's in the hallway.

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:49.184
There is no boy.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.478
Where is miss Thomas?

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.686
We know you killed James.

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:34.229
What happened to me, Chris?

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:39.734
Where's Kate?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:41.970
James!

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:50.812
Why did you kill your friend?

01:10:51.305 --> 01:10:57.225
