00:31.995 --> 00:33.288
Oh.

00:33.448 --> 00:34.409
Ohh!

00:35.593 --> 00:36.649
Whoo!

00:36.664 --> 00:38.436
. Whoo.

00:40.603 --> 00:43.270
_

00:46.367 --> 00:50.231
_

00:52.491 --> 00:54.386
Mm-hmm.

01:33.139 --> 01:34.574
The Morristown Frackers

01:34.610 --> 01:37.280
would like to thank you
all for attending today.

01:40.363 --> 01:44.467
All... oh, let's call it a dozen of you.

01:44.550 --> 01:46.086
Guess you lucky fans

01:46.158 --> 01:48.286
can just feel free to
stretch your legs right out

01:48.354 --> 01:50.362
and enjoy your own section

01:50.437 --> 01:52.673
all to yourself.

01:59.551 --> 02:01.101
Hey.

02:01.348 --> 02:03.651
What, um... What are
you... What are you wearing?

02:03.717 --> 02:05.386
Yeah, all right. I
know I look ridiculous,

02:05.452 --> 02:08.074
but my dad wore it when they
went on a winning streak in '86,

02:08.150 --> 02:11.187
so I figured, can't hurt.

02:11.324 --> 02:15.462
Is dressing badly, like,
just a thing for baseball?

02:15.529 --> 02:17.230
'Cause that would explain his jacket.

02:17.297 --> 02:20.433
Superstition is a thing in baseball.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.269
It's a tradition that if
you're on a losing streak,

02:22.336 --> 02:23.871
you change everything that you're doing.

02:23.938 --> 02:24.939
And if you're on a winning streak,

02:25.005 --> 02:26.506
you don't change anything.

02:26.574 --> 02:28.175
Well said. Now, can you say
some of that into the mic?

02:28.242 --> 02:29.743
I ain't paying you to talk to Charles.

02:29.809 --> 02:30.811
Uribe's at the plate.

02:32.813 --> 02:34.041
I don't need a microphone

02:34.105 --> 02:37.517
to chat with a dozen
people at the ballpark.

02:37.585 --> 02:40.653
Hey, Uribe! You look
slimmer! Did you lose weight?

02:40.720 --> 02:44.325
Oh, yes, I did, Jim.
Thank you for noticing.

02:45.158 --> 02:47.628
As long as it's into the mic.

02:51.032 --> 02:54.401
Pedro Uribe has lost weight.

02:54.468 --> 02:56.670
That is all.

02:56.736 --> 02:59.272
You know what's not helping
my suicidal depression?

02:59.339 --> 03:01.509
Calling baseball games
into an empty stadium

03:01.575 --> 03:03.743
and having my own words
bounce back into my face

03:03.811 --> 03:07.014
like some kind of haunting
metaphor for life's futility.

03:07.081 --> 03:09.683
Listen, my plan is gonna take time.

03:09.749 --> 03:11.919
Morristown has been drowning
in apathy for so long,

03:11.986 --> 03:13.287
they... they don't even recognize

03:13.354 --> 03:15.122
that I'm throwing them a life preserver.

03:15.188 --> 03:17.343
Plus, I'm competing with
dirt-cheap entertainment

03:17.413 --> 03:18.580
that's in every home here.

03:18.926 --> 03:20.161
Cable?

03:21.194 --> 03:23.263
- Meth.
- Ah.

03:23.331 --> 03:25.266
But they'll all come around soon enough

03:25.332 --> 03:27.867
'cause I'm offering the
only drug more powerful.

03:27.934 --> 03:29.336
Heroin.

03:29.402 --> 03:31.104
Nostalgia.

03:31.171 --> 03:33.873
I think you're wildly
underestimating heroin.

03:33.940 --> 03:35.368
When the team starts winning again,

03:35.423 --> 03:39.446
everyone's gonna come back so
they can relive the glory days.

03:39.512 --> 03:40.480
What makes you think

03:40.528 --> 03:42.550
that that team is gonna
win any ball games?

03:42.617 --> 03:46.687
Our luck is gonna change. We're due!

03:46.754 --> 03:48.989
The team, me, even you.

04:00.801 --> 04:04.104
Oh, yeah, laugh at my hope.

04:04.170 --> 04:07.942
I'm sorry, it's just...
You actually believe that?

04:08.125 --> 04:11.044
Yeah, and I put my money where
my mouth is when I got my loan.

04:13.213 --> 04:14.881
You know what? Let me
take a look at this.

04:14.949 --> 04:16.550
- No, wait, 'cause it's...
- No, no! Come on.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.519
No! It's turtle racing starting soon.

04:18.586 --> 04:20.286
- Stacy.
- Come on, hey, let me see it.

04:20.353 --> 04:21.721
I know a thing or two about loans.

04:21.789 --> 04:24.223
I did a bunch of commercials
for reverse mortgages

04:24.290 --> 04:25.660
back in the Philippines.

04:26.660 --> 04:28.661
Is it big enough?

04:28.728 --> 04:31.164
Uh, I'm gonna need you to
top me off, though, first.

04:31.232 --> 04:34.635
Jesus, you're blowing
through all my good whiskey.

04:36.103 --> 04:37.403
Care for some...

04:38.538 --> 04:40.039
... Sambuca?

04:50.785 --> 04:53.020
You have a balloon payment due

04:53.086 --> 04:55.188
after the first month of the season?

04:55.248 --> 04:57.917
Yep. Hey! No nudging the turtles!

04:59.927 --> 05:01.795
Yeah, wait till you get to page 47.

05:01.862 --> 05:03.263
No, I saw that.

05:03.329 --> 05:05.999
The team has to finish above .500.

05:09.869 --> 05:13.139
Why in the world would
you agree to all this crap?

05:13.206 --> 05:15.009
I couldn't just let the team die.

05:15.076 --> 05:17.544
It would be like losing a limb.

05:17.610 --> 05:21.486
My dad played first base for
Morristown from '81 to '87.

05:22.449 --> 05:26.619
Shit, I lost my virginity in
the visitors' bullpen in '88.

05:26.687 --> 05:29.189
I did what I had to do.

05:29.256 --> 05:31.859
Here's to giant, life-altering mistakes.

05:31.925 --> 05:34.861
We both know them well.

05:34.929 --> 05:37.131
We surely do.

05:39.365 --> 05:41.934
Ugh! This shit is disgusting.

05:42.002 --> 05:43.603
- It does the trick.
-  Mm-hmm.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.139
Christ's sakes, you're
starting to look good to me,

05:46.206 --> 05:47.874
and you're a goddamned disaster.

05:47.942 --> 05:50.110
Well, thank you for the half-compliment.

05:50.177 --> 05:51.545
And for the record,

05:51.612 --> 05:54.281
you looked good to me when
that bottle was still full.

05:54.348 --> 05:56.884
I'll give you one shot.

05:56.951 --> 05:58.485
Woo me.

05:58.552 --> 06:01.188
I may not be the best in any room,

06:01.254 --> 06:04.057
but I am definitely
the best in this room.

06:10.598 --> 06:12.566
- Get it off!
- I'm getting it off!

06:12.632 --> 06:14.798
Aah!

06:14.901 --> 06:16.336
All right, for those
of you just joining us,

06:16.403 --> 06:18.105
I got a good one going here.

06:18.172 --> 06:19.540
Brockmire taking no chances,

06:19.607 --> 06:21.008
starting right off in the missionary.

06:21.074 --> 06:22.375
Okay, shh.

06:22.442 --> 06:23.810
- He's trying to find his rhythm.
- Okay, okay, shh.

06:23.877 --> 06:25.312
Ho!

06:25.379 --> 06:28.581
Julia James with a surprise
finger in the keister!

06:28.648 --> 06:30.516
And Brockmire is into it.

06:31.819 --> 06:33.319
Oh, man!

06:33.386 --> 06:36.089
The old fastball sign makes
for a real snug butt plug.

06:36.156 --> 06:37.857
Okay, folks.

06:37.925 --> 06:40.494
Bott...

06:40.560 --> 06:41.994
Bottom of the 9th.

06:44.197 --> 06:45.765
Frackers have runners on the corners,

06:45.833 --> 06:47.167
and I'm just gonna...

06:47.233 --> 06:50.369
I'm gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.

06:50.437 --> 06:53.006
Sambuca.

06:55.708 --> 07:00.012
Hey, am I wrong? Is the
winning point at bat?

07:00.079 --> 07:02.815
The winning run is up, yes,

07:02.882 --> 07:04.217
but he hits the ball

07:04.285 --> 07:06.487
like he's trying to wake
it up from a little nap,

07:06.554 --> 07:09.656
so I'm just gonna take it easy
until he makes the final out.

07:09.723 --> 07:10.924
Okay, whatever,

07:10.990 --> 07:12.425
as long as you stop talking about...

07:12.492 --> 07:15.228
Oh, my God, last night was
some of the best sex I ever had.

07:15.295 --> 07:18.098
No. No, you didn't
stop talking about it.

07:18.165 --> 07:20.333
There was an improvisational
quality to it.

07:20.401 --> 07:23.069
It... It was like every
surface in her apartment

07:23.127 --> 07:25.262
- was a workbench upon which...
- No.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.502
Yeah, upon which

07:26.531 --> 07:27.815
- we constructed our sexual art.
- Please.

07:28.074 --> 07:31.110
Hey, Jim? Please stop, okay?

07:31.177 --> 07:32.612
Jules is like my mom,

07:32.680 --> 07:35.014
and you've been talking
about having sex with her

07:35.081 --> 07:36.149
for the past three hours.

07:36.216 --> 07:37.683
- I just...
- It's messed up!

07:37.751 --> 07:39.853
I just... I have to end things with her

07:39.920 --> 07:42.156
before everything gets messy,

07:42.223 --> 07:44.258
metaphorically and literally.

07:44.324 --> 07:46.592
We went through half a
tube of lube last night.

07:46.660 --> 07:47.828
Aaaah!

07:47.910 --> 07:49.144
Stop it! Stop, shh!

07:49.196 --> 07:50.998
This wasn't about vaginal moisture.

07:51.064 --> 07:52.533
She has that in spades.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.701
It was strictly a friction issue.

07:54.768 --> 07:56.336
Shut up!

07:58.538 --> 08:00.173
Lazy fly ball to left field.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.642
This should do it, folks.

08:02.877 --> 08:03.877
Whoa!

08:03.944 --> 08:05.379
No! It falls!

08:05.446 --> 08:08.549
And now Maldonado kicks
it like it owes him money.

08:08.615 --> 08:11.517
And now they're sprinting
around the bases.

08:11.584 --> 08:14.120
- Go, go, go!
- It's a Little League home run!

08:14.187 --> 08:15.855
The Frackers win!

08:17.057 --> 08:19.559
The Frackers win!

08:21.528 --> 08:23.864
Yeah! Whoo!

08:31.271 --> 08:33.039
Uh...

08:35.073 --> 08:37.543
Uh... for the record,

08:37.610 --> 08:39.879
Sambuca tastes better
on the way out, folks.

08:42.416 --> 08:43.884
Ohh.

08:43.951 --> 08:46.687
Look, I'm disaster on about
17 different levels, all right,

08:46.754 --> 08:49.255
so I just think any more
hanky panky between us

08:49.322 --> 08:51.524
would, well, probably be a mistake.

08:51.591 --> 08:52.826
Huge mistake.

08:52.893 --> 08:55.394
For Christ's sakes, you say
things like "hanky panky."

08:55.461 --> 08:56.896
Trust me, sleeping with you

08:56.964 --> 08:58.365
was one of the biggest
regrets of my life,

08:58.432 --> 09:00.834
and I have a tattoo of a
dream catcher on my ankle.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.549
To be clear, okay, I...

09:02.612 --> 09:04.580
Hey, I do not think that I am capable

09:04.660 --> 09:07.144
of having a successful
adult relationship anymore.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.776
Yeah, no. That's... abundantly clear.

09:09.842 --> 09:13.145
Well, getting emasculated
in front of America

09:13.212 --> 09:14.581
caused me to chase ass like a Kennedy,

09:14.640 --> 09:18.055
but, you know, you're not
just some fling in a bar.

09:18.102 --> 09:19.219
You happen to be my boss.

09:19.286 --> 09:21.154
So... What... What...
What are you doing?

09:21.220 --> 09:23.322
Are you serious?

09:23.389 --> 09:24.857
They won.

09:24.924 --> 09:28.227
So... unfortunately for both of us,

09:28.294 --> 09:31.831
we're gonna have to repeat
everything we did last night.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.982
Ho, what the hell. All right.

09:37.021 --> 09:38.772
Uh, just keep that dream
catcher tattoo covered up,

09:38.839 --> 09:41.374
because I have to maintain
an erection over here.

09:41.442 --> 09:43.210
I actually don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

09:43.277 --> 09:45.012
I call bottom this time!

09:48.615 --> 09:50.549
I can believe you went
down on me three times.

09:50.616 --> 09:52.101
Oh, I can do it again.

09:52.149 --> 09:53.119
You still haven't experienced

09:53.194 --> 09:56.517
what I like to call the
conference on the mound.

09:56.526 --> 09:57.820
- Okay, shh.
- You know, it's kind of a...

09:57.915 --> 09:59.724
Shut up.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.194
Is that the finger
that you put in my ass?

10:02.786 --> 10:03.820
Shh.

10:05.106 --> 10:06.661
Hope you folks are all enjoying

10:06.706 --> 10:09.009
"Free Cold Medicine Day"
here at the ballpark.

10:09.070 --> 10:12.071
Quick reminder... Go ahead
and have another gel pack.

10:12.138 --> 10:13.606
The Frackers won't judge you

10:13.674 --> 10:16.197
like those snooty pharmacy assholes.

10:16.276 --> 10:18.112
All right, now, listen up.

10:18.179 --> 10:19.480
We got a good one going here.

10:19.546 --> 10:20.882
Look at the field now,

10:20.948 --> 10:22.316
because the Frackers are threatening

10:22.382 --> 10:23.550
here in the bottom of the 8th

10:23.617 --> 10:25.185
with runners on the corners.

10:27.021 --> 10:28.822
And here comes the pitch.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.452
Whoo!

10:31.524 --> 10:35.928
Some might call that Istanbul,
but I call it Constantinople!

10:35.996 --> 10:37.801
The Frackers take the lead!

10:37.857 --> 10:39.599
My gosh, what a comeback.

10:39.666 --> 10:44.937
So, a Sambuca-fueled Brockmire
is still struggling mightily

10:45.004 --> 10:46.205
with the button-fly jeans.

10:46.272 --> 10:47.974
Come on, now!

10:48.041 --> 10:49.810
All right. Here comes the
payoff pitch from Grant.

10:50.978 --> 10:53.180
Deep fly ball to center field.

10:53.247 --> 10:54.615
Back at the warning track.

10:54.681 --> 10:56.616
He makes the grab,

10:56.684 --> 11:01.355
and the Frackers miraculously
escape a bases-loaded jam.

11:01.421 --> 11:03.324
My goodness!

11:04.724 --> 11:05.558
Proceed.

11:07.261 --> 11:09.063
Oh, my God. Just shoot me.

11:09.129 --> 11:10.196
Frickin' shoot me.

11:10.263 --> 11:11.731
Oh, my goodness.

11:11.799 --> 11:14.134
He dropped the ball. That's a balk!

11:14.200 --> 11:15.604
A walk-off balk

11:15.628 --> 11:18.071
gives the Frackers
their fifth win in a row.

11:18.138 --> 11:20.340
Now I have seen everything.

11:20.407 --> 11:21.474
Cheers.

11:25.378 --> 11:27.046
Oh, it's happening.

11:27.113 --> 11:29.016
- No, he's not!
- It's happening.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.285
No! Oh, yes!

11:31.352 --> 11:34.355
All right! Go, Brockmire!

11:34.421 --> 11:36.356
Oh, my God!

11:36.424 --> 11:37.624
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:37.688 --> 11:42.663
Brockmire showing the crowd
why naked men should never run.

11:44.230 --> 11:48.868
Your dick and balls look like
they're having a fistfight!

11:49.903 --> 11:51.337
Home run... Frackers!

11:51.405 --> 11:53.540
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

11:53.607 --> 11:56.276

an ambulance on the way here.

12:12.993 --> 12:16.363
I-I... It was full of
blood for a blood drive.

12:16.430 --> 12:17.731
I kept slipping in it.

12:17.764 --> 12:19.381
- Wait, so that's not your blood?
- No.

12:19.453 --> 12:21.033
- Get out. Get out.
- I don't know whose blood this is.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.403
- I don't know whose blood this is!
- Close the door.

12:23.470 --> 12:25.938
She's already singing.
We don't have any time.

These people... They
are high on nostalgia.

13:03.810 --> 13:05.045
Jules!

13:05.112 --> 13:06.413
- Jules.
- Hey!

13:06.479 --> 13:09.282
Who's that haircut with teeth?

13:09.349 --> 13:10.683
Um, that's Gary.

13:10.751 --> 13:12.486
- Gary.
- He's the point person around here

13:12.552 --> 13:14.620
for Pennsylvania Shale Oil and Gas.

13:14.687 --> 13:16.322
We kind of had a thing for a bit.

13:16.389 --> 13:17.356
Did you now?

13:18.559 --> 13:19.860
Look at this crowd.

13:19.926 --> 13:22.796
I'm so proud of you.
Your dream's coming true.

13:22.863 --> 13:24.198
Mm.

13:24.264 --> 13:25.731
Thank you.

13:25.799 --> 13:27.468
Um, Gary, I want you to meet...

13:27.535 --> 13:29.269
Jim Brockmire.

13:29.335 --> 13:30.870
Wow. I'll tell you what.

13:30.937 --> 13:33.882
I am a big fan of your
work in Kansas City.

13:33.945 --> 13:35.875
- I don't like you.
- What?

13:35.978 --> 13:38.177
Something about your essence is
just rubbing me the wrong way,

13:38.343 --> 13:39.213
so I'd appreciate it if you'd just...

13:39.280 --> 13:40.347
just keep your distance from me.

13:40.413 --> 13:42.482
Uh, Jim...

13:42.564 --> 13:45.535
Gary is a friend.

13:45.601 --> 13:47.780
He's the one who helped me get my loan

13:47.874 --> 13:48.707
so I could buy the team.

13:48.801 --> 13:49.563
- Really?
- Yes.

13:49.581 --> 13:50.476
'Cause I read that loan,

13:50.524 --> 13:52.092
and no true friend would
ever let you sign it.

13:52.713 --> 13:54.581
Come on. The guy is
obviously up to something.

13:54.647 --> 13:57.151
The man works for a gas
company, for crying out loud.

13:57.218 --> 14:00.187
Never trust a man who sucks
Satan's dick for a living.

14:00.253 --> 14:01.555
All right.

14:01.622 --> 14:03.589
Nice to meet you. Stay
the hell away from me.

14:03.656 --> 14:06.993
Don't be sorry. Everybody gets jealous.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.863
Jea... Uh, whoa. Excuse...

14:09.930 --> 14:12.132
Now, why would I be jealous, sweetheart?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.434
Well, it's only natural.

14:13.501 --> 14:15.302
When two people spend
this much time together,

14:15.368 --> 14:16.637
feelings bubble up.

14:16.704 --> 14:18.771
Darlin', I don't have feelings for you.

14:18.839 --> 14:20.941
I don't have feelings for anybody.

14:23.611 --> 14:25.679
Just out of curiosity, though,

14:25.746 --> 14:29.049
um, how long did you and
Gary date for, anyway?

14:29.116 --> 14:31.651
We went out two or three times.

14:31.718 --> 14:33.653
Did you, uh, have sex with him?

14:33.720 --> 14:35.755
Seven and a half...

14:35.823 --> 14:39.126
Depends how you... I mean,
eight times, probably.

14:39.208 --> 14:40.876
Wow. Seven and a half.

14:40.927 --> 14:41.643
Half a time?

14:41.679 --> 14:43.114
That should have been
interesting. All right.

14:43.731 --> 14:45.432
Just... I'm sorry. I
can't... I... Really?

14:45.498 --> 14:48.334
'Cause I can't believe you
actually had sex with that guy.

14:48.401 --> 14:49.836
Why? He's very nice

14:49.904 --> 14:51.183
and knows a lot about wine

14:51.192 --> 14:52.221
- and isn't diabetic.
- Oh.

14:52.284 --> 14:54.074
And around here, that makes him
the catch of the frickin' century.

14:54.141 --> 14:55.843
And you know what? You
have no right to judge me.

14:55.910 --> 14:58.679
You've admitted to having
sex with prostitutes

14:58.746 --> 15:00.146
all over the world.

15:00.214 --> 15:02.382
Hey, I was helping those
ladies find a new life

15:02.449 --> 15:03.483
20 bucks at a time.

15:03.550 --> 15:04.718
20 bucks?

15:04.785 --> 15:06.987
Oh, the dollar's very strong right now.

15:07.054 --> 15:08.756
You know what? You're an asshole.

15:08.823 --> 15:10.924
I can't even look at
you. Tonight, blindfolds.

15:10.991 --> 15:12.391
No, we're not. You know why?

15:12.459 --> 15:13.926
'Cause I'm tired of treating my dick

15:13.993 --> 15:15.294
like some kind of a lucky

15:15.367 --> 15:16.136
- rabbit's foot.
- Oh.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.263
No, the idea that our sex

15:17.330 --> 15:20.032
is actually helping the
Frackers win ball games is...

15:20.099 --> 15:21.067
It's ludicrous.

15:21.133 --> 15:23.369
So, if you don't believe in the streak

15:23.436 --> 15:25.638
and you don't have any feelings for me,

15:25.705 --> 15:26.873
why have we been having sex

15:26.940 --> 15:28.541
every night for the last two weeks?

15:28.608 --> 15:30.444
Because I thought my only other option

15:30.518 --> 15:32.762
was talking to that asshole all night.

15:32.810 --> 15:33.516
But you know?

15:33.578 --> 15:34.587
- No, maybe I made a mistake.
- Oh.

15:34.627 --> 15:36.049
Hey, friend? Excuse me.

15:36.116 --> 15:37.184
What's your story?

15:37.251 --> 15:38.786
Oh. Well...

15:38.853 --> 15:41.387
I was born two days prematurely.

15:41.454 --> 15:42.823
No, no.

15:42.890 --> 15:44.725
Clearly, I was right to
have sex with you instead.

15:44.731 --> 15:46.459
So, all right. How about this...

15:46.560 --> 15:47.928
Ehh...

15:47.994 --> 15:50.062
I don't really feel like it anymore.

15:50.130 --> 15:52.499
I mean, I didn't feel like
it half the times we did it.

15:52.565 --> 15:55.134
Your personal grooming is...

15:56.603 --> 15:58.238
It's atrocious, and you
smell like weird herbs.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.906
Oh, that's the Sambuca.

15:59.973 --> 16:03.743
Only reason I did it was because
it was my civic frickin' duty.

16:03.810 --> 16:06.680
But I would rather lose
every game from here on in

16:06.747 --> 16:09.416
than have sex with you again.

16:09.483 --> 16:12.185
Fi-Fine. Okay.

16:12.252 --> 16:15.855
I'll bet we win tomorrow's game by...

16:15.922 --> 16:18.790
And with the score 18-0,

16:18.858 --> 16:20.761
looks like the fairy tale is over

16:20.828 --> 16:22.863
and the Frackers have
turned back into a pumpkin

16:22.930 --> 16:24.231
through no fault of anyone's

16:24.297 --> 16:27.266
other than the players
on the field, of course.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.819
All right. Frackers are
down to their final out.

16:38.886 --> 16:40.521
Here comes the pitch.

16:40.588 --> 16:42.290
Good slider there,

16:42.357 --> 16:45.693
and the count goes to 0-2 now to Uribe.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.062
Hey, Brockmire!

16:47.129 --> 16:49.999
You want to party with Uribe tonight?

16:52.367 --> 16:54.435
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm free.

16:54.502 --> 16:55.736
Strike!

16:55.804 --> 16:57.838
I guess I'm free now.

17:00.308 --> 17:03.010
So, is you dating anyone?

17:03.078 --> 17:05.579
No. Why do you ask that?

17:05.646 --> 17:08.415
Oh, I think maybe you and Miss Jules.

17:08.483 --> 17:10.217
No, no. Hey, no.

17:10.284 --> 17:13.253
Nothing going on between
me and Miss "Hools."

17:13.320 --> 17:15.890
What about you? You...
You got anybody special?

17:15.958 --> 17:18.359
Ha. Uribe never marry.

17:18.425 --> 17:21.796
No one ties me down,
not even my 13 kids.

17:21.864 --> 17:23.832
13 kids?

17:23.897 --> 17:25.165
I'm Catholic.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.468
Condoms are sin, and I hate to pull out.

17:27.536 --> 17:29.805
I hear you. Very difficult
to leave the party

17:29.872 --> 17:31.239
when it is just getting good.

17:31.306 --> 17:33.434
Child support is why I still play,

17:33.538 --> 17:35.376
even though I only 29.

17:35.443 --> 17:38.446
American kids are so expensive.

17:38.513 --> 17:40.381
The Dominican ones, not so much.

17:40.449 --> 17:41.883
The dollar is very strong right now.

17:41.950 --> 17:43.818
Oh, hey. You... You
don't have to tell me.

17:45.753 --> 17:47.655
Ooh-ha!

17:47.722 --> 17:49.691
Ah.

17:49.758 --> 17:52.828
And as my guest...

17:52.895 --> 17:55.364
you can pick.

17:55.431 --> 17:56.598
Oh. Well, uh...

17:56.665 --> 17:58.833
Well, let's just...
We'll let the girls pick.

17:58.901 --> 18:00.068
You're cute.

18:00.135 --> 18:02.636
You remind me of my favorite stepdad.

18:02.703 --> 18:05.507
I... Oh... Well, you
know, I get that a lot.

18:05.513 --> 18:08.279
- Um, Uribe.
- Hmm?

18:08.350 --> 18:09.811
Pedro?

18:09.877 --> 18:11.379
Um...

18:11.446 --> 18:14.382
How likely is this to
become a group-sex situation?

18:14.450 --> 18:15.984
No, because, in the fog of war,

18:16.050 --> 18:17.586
sometimes things get a little chaotic,

18:17.653 --> 18:19.788
so I think we should
set some ground rules.

18:19.855 --> 18:21.056
Oye.

18:21.123 --> 18:23.091
I am no cigua, okay?

18:23.157 --> 18:26.060
If my dick is inside of a woman,

18:26.127 --> 18:28.963
whatever you do to me is not gay,

18:29.030 --> 18:30.365
so do a lot of it.

18:32.835 --> 18:34.302
A lot!

18:34.368 --> 18:35.538
A lot.

18:37.439 --> 18:38.340
Hey.

18:38.406 --> 18:40.509
Let's make things interesting.

18:40.576 --> 18:41.710
Oh.

18:43.511 --> 18:44.980
Mmm.

18:45.047 --> 18:47.048
They're already pretty fascinating.

18:49.851 --> 18:51.585
- Who is it?
- Brockmire.

18:54.423 --> 18:56.324
I thought you were with Uribe.

18:56.366 --> 18:59.846
I was, I was, but I think I realized

18:59.885 --> 19:01.228
that I don't want to
be that guy anymore.

19:01.296 --> 19:03.198
Maybe I never was
that guy, but I just...

19:03.264 --> 19:04.899
I wanted to be because
then that would mean

19:04.966 --> 19:07.468
I couldn't be hurt again or something.

19:07.536 --> 19:08.904
I just...

19:08.971 --> 19:10.439
I know that I like you.

19:10.505 --> 19:13.407
I like that you see the world
for the shit pile that it is,

19:13.474 --> 19:15.443
but that just makes you shovel faster.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.078
Most of all, I like that we seem to have

19:18.145 --> 19:20.949
the same exact level of
functional alcoholism.

19:21.016 --> 19:22.918
I don't want to be
getting gross and high

19:22.984 --> 19:24.218
with a bunch of strangers.

19:24.286 --> 19:27.222
I want to... I want to be here with you.

19:27.289 --> 19:28.857
Are you high right now?

19:28.924 --> 19:30.826
A little bit, yes. I-I'm not prude.

19:30.893 --> 19:32.494
I had a couple toots. Come on.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.868
You know, the thing is, is you and me...

19:35.908 --> 19:36.832
It's just not a good idea.

19:36.898 --> 19:39.266
This is a terrible idea, but...

19:40.668 --> 19:43.938
I looked into your eyes for
a long time the other night.

19:44.005 --> 19:46.474
I know that you're feeling
the same things I am.

19:46.541 --> 19:47.542
I know it.

19:48.141 --> 19:50.044
Baseball makes me want to exist.

19:50.112 --> 19:54.339
You... You make me want to live.

19:55.183 --> 19:59.020
God... damn it.

20:22.961 --> 20:23.903
As many of you know,

20:24.015 --> 20:26.150
it was our plan to
encourage a bankruptcy

20:26.217 --> 20:27.819
of the Morristown baseball team

20:27.886 --> 20:29.620
so that we could demolish the stadium

20:29.687 --> 20:31.889
and build a long-needed wastewater pit.

20:31.956 --> 20:34.191
Well, unfortunately,
attendance is much higher

20:34.259 --> 20:35.647
than, uh, our models predicted,

20:35.702 --> 20:37.694
so, uh, it is my position

20:37.774 --> 20:41.114
that we take a much
more... aggressive stance.

20:41.154 --> 20:43.534
Um, all in favor?

20:43.601 --> 20:45.137
Okay, good.

20:45.195 --> 20:49.398
Last but certainly not least.

20:52.878 --> 20:55.147
Sweet, sweet Deb.

20:55.214 --> 20:57.081
My favorite memories
of you will always be

20:57.140 --> 20:59.495
from the 2013 retreat in Mazatlán.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.952
You were a diamond

21:01.019 --> 21:02.954
that glittered for us all that weekend,

21:03.021 --> 21:04.522
and call me sentimental,

21:04.589 --> 21:07.037
but I'd like to see you
glitter one more time.

21:07.108 --> 21:10.762
So, Deb, do you remember...

21:10.829 --> 21:12.397
the Margarita Men?

21:15.434 --> 21:18.003
Look at her face! We
love you, Deborah Gortley!

21:18.070 --> 21:19.538
Whoo!

21:19.605 --> 21:21.272
Mazatlán! Mazatlán!

21:21.339 --> 21:22.441
Mazatlán! Mazatlán!

21:22.508 --> 21:24.009
This is Pennsylvania Shale right here!
