01:55.540 --> 01:57.460
Did you see
all of that money?

01:57.460 --> 01:59.250
Yeah, the only thing
better than lookin' at it

01:59.250 --> 02:00.790
is helpin' her spend it.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.290
She gonna let us
spend it, right?

02:04.290 --> 02:07.500
Yeah, we're her kids.
She just wants to make us happy.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.000
And if we're happy,
she's happy,

02:10.000 --> 02:11.620
so, if she doesn't give us
that money,

02:11.620 --> 02:12.670
she's really
only hurtin' herself.

02:12.670 --> 02:14.830
Exactly.
So, what are you

02:14.830 --> 02:16.420
gonna buy
to make Mom happy?

02:16.420 --> 02:19.620
Nia, I'm a simple man,

02:19.620 --> 02:21.460
with simple needs.

02:21.460 --> 02:24.170
I'm thinkin'... a zipline!

02:24.170 --> 02:28.210
From my bedroom
to the refrigerator!

02:28.210 --> 02:30.460
-Boh-bah-day!
-Ah-ha!

02:31.330 --> 02:33.330
Love the zipline,
but I'm gonna go

02:33.330 --> 02:34.750
in a slightly
different direction.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.580
Let me guess.
You're gonna use your money

02:36.580 --> 02:38.170
on some needy cause.

02:38.170 --> 02:39.540
Yeah! Me!

02:39.540 --> 02:41.170
'Cause I needy me a new 'fit.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.380
Both:
Hey!

02:43.380 --> 02:45.580
Hey, that-- that was our thing!

02:46.620 --> 02:49.420
Well, I'm gonna invest
my share in stocks.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.000
Stocks, shmocks,
I'm gonna get dental work.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.580
You have cavities?

02:53.580 --> 02:55.580
No, I want a diamond.

02:55.580 --> 02:56.580
Right here, so when I smile,

02:56.580 --> 02:58.460
it pings!

02:58.460 --> 03:01.500
Guys, you can have fun
imagining, but remember,

03:01.500 --> 03:04.580
it's not your money, it's...

03:04.580 --> 03:07.580
Both:
our money!

03:07.580 --> 03:11.040
Not our money,
my money!

03:12.040 --> 03:13.500
What? Come on, Mom,
we're your kids!

03:13.500 --> 03:16.000
Exactly. Which is why
you should repeat
after me:

03:16.000 --> 03:17.580
-My...
-Both: My...

03:17.580 --> 03:19.040
-Muh...
-Muh...

03:19.040 --> 03:21.710
-Nee.
-Nee. Exactly.

03:21.710 --> 03:23.500
My money,
which I have plans for,

03:23.500 --> 03:24.670
thank you very much.

03:24.670 --> 03:25.830
What kind of plans?

03:25.830 --> 03:28.380
Nunya plans.
Which means nunya business.

03:28.380 --> 03:30.710
That's why I hid it
in a place you'll
never suspect.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.670
I suspect it's
under the towel.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.000
Why are you here?

03:35.830 --> 03:37.330
Why am I ever here?

03:37.330 --> 03:40.330
Another good question.
And, no,

03:40.330 --> 03:41.500
it's not under the towel.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.040
-It's under the towel.
-Yeah.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.040
Well, now we know
where our money is.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.670
Your money?
I think she was pretty clear

03:51.670 --> 03:56.000
with that
"my muh-neee" thing.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.290
Hey, I'm not worried.
Mom will come around
and give us some.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.960
Oh, no!
Our money is gone!

04:09.620 --> 04:13.120
Oh, no!
I just had a vision of Mom
saying she lost the money!

04:13.120 --> 04:14.710
What? How?

04:14.710 --> 04:16.250
I don't know,
but that's what she said!

04:16.250 --> 04:17.620
In that case, I'm out.

04:17.620 --> 04:20.500
Now I gotta find
a new way to pay
for my tooth diamond!

04:21.330 --> 04:24.580
Booker, this is bad.
You need to tell Mom
what you saw.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.670
No way.
Then I have to admit
I have visions.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.620
Well, maybe it's about time
you did.

04:28.620 --> 04:29.750
Look, you know Mom.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.000
She's not gonna understand,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.540
and what she doesn't understand,
she tries to fix.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.330
Remember when I had
those two pointy teeth

04:36.330 --> 04:37.620
that made me look
like a vampire?

04:37.620 --> 04:39.210
-No.
-Exactly!

04:39.580 --> 04:41.460
'Cause she had 'em filed down!

04:42.750 --> 04:45.000
Me, I loved my fangs.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.170
I didn't even need
the little straw
to open up a juice box.

04:48.170 --> 04:50.580
I just... (hisses)

04:51.830 --> 04:54.330
Anyway, I'm not telling her
about my visions.

04:54.330 --> 04:56.380
They're... they're like
my superpower.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.380
Oh, so you're
a superhero?

04:58.380 --> 05:01.710
Well, I may be
a little early in my career,
but yes.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.460
Look, Nia, I...

05:05.460 --> 05:07.040
I know I always talk
about having game,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.080
but... my visions
actually up my game.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.080
And I'm not lettin' Mom
take that away from me.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.500
Fine, but if you're
not gonna tell her,

05:16.500 --> 05:19.330
then we've gotta do something
to make sure this vision
never comes true.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.710
She can't lose that money.

05:20.710 --> 05:22.210
-Our money.
-Her money.

05:22.210 --> 05:23.670
-Her money.
-Right!

05:23.670 --> 05:25.210
That we're gonna get some of.

05:25.210 --> 05:26.960
Both:
Ah!

05:28.750 --> 05:30.170
(sniffs)

05:30.170 --> 05:31.620
(sighs)

05:32.750 --> 05:34.830
-Hey, Rae.
-Hey.

05:34.830 --> 05:36.710
So, you have any plans
for all that money,

05:36.710 --> 05:38.790
or are you just gonna
keep takin' baths
with it?

05:38.790 --> 05:41.830
Don't knock a money bath
till you tried it, Chels.

05:41.830 --> 05:44.170
So you don't have a plan.

05:44.170 --> 05:47.210
I have a plan.
I always have a plan.

05:47.210 --> 05:49.710
When have you known me
not to have a plan, Chels?

05:49.710 --> 05:50.960
I don't have a plan!

05:50.960 --> 05:52.920
I don't!
I'm slipping thousands
of dollars

05:52.920 --> 05:53.960
into a pink backpack!

05:53.960 --> 05:55.670
Pinky!
Pinky is my plan!

05:55.670 --> 05:58.540
Oh, hey!
It's okay, chill!

05:58.540 --> 06:00.790
You don't have
to figure this all out today.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.210
-Right?
-Right.

06:02.210 --> 06:05.670
With all this cash,
and your new job
as a Scut driver,

06:05.670 --> 06:07.670
and my new urban garden,

06:07.670 --> 06:09.670
you can relax.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.170
Mmm, what does
your dirty garden
have to do with anything?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.750
Planting is very therapeutic.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.080
Ugh, see, there's
three things I hate:

06:18.080 --> 06:20.540
Lookin' at dirt,
diggin' dirt,

06:20.540 --> 06:22.380
and talkin' about dirt.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.210
Oh, is this still
about that dirt pie

06:25.210 --> 06:26.790
I made you eat
when we were 10?

06:26.790 --> 06:29.750
Yes, Chels!
And I can still taste it!

06:32.290 --> 06:34.750
All I know is that this money
is gonna give me

06:34.750 --> 06:37.620
a second chance
to do something
with my life, you know?

06:37.620 --> 06:39.790
I can do anything.
I can-- I can start
a fashion line.

06:39.790 --> 06:43.080
-Mm-hm.
-Just... just somethin'
to help my kids.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.000
You know?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.880
So until I can get to the bank
on Monday, I have to keep
this money safe.

06:49.580 --> 06:51.120
Oh Scut, I gotta
get to work.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.620
Oh gosh, and I gotta
get to the gardening store.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.330
Anything you want me
to pick up while I'm there?

06:55.330 --> 06:57.120
Uh... an application.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.830
Wow, look at you,
wanting to work two jobs!

07:00.830 --> 07:02.960
No, no I just want you
to work one.

07:05.580 --> 07:08.620
Okay... all we have to do
is wait for Mom to go to work,

07:08.620 --> 07:10.830
and then we'll take the money
and hide it so we
can't lose it.

07:10.830 --> 07:14.120
See?
This is where my zipline
would come in handy.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.080
We could zip in...
and zip out!

07:16.080 --> 07:17.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

07:17.420 --> 07:19.420
But, no, no, no.

07:19.420 --> 07:21.540
Because at some point,
after you zip in,

07:21.540 --> 07:23.460
you gotta zip off,
grab the money,

07:23.460 --> 07:25.170
-zip back on--
-Ooh-ooh-ooh!

07:25.170 --> 07:27.210
-And then zip out!
-Would you two just zip it?

07:28.620 --> 07:30.790
I like your hat, Mom.

07:31.790 --> 07:32.880
And yours.

07:34.290 --> 07:36.580
Why are you all loiterin'
outside my door?

07:36.580 --> 07:39.710
-Hmm.
-We're, uh...
We're hall walking.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.170
Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.920
Levi is about to take
his hall monitor's exam,

07:43.920 --> 07:45.460
-and he needs practice.
-Oh.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.420
Okay!
You two, back to class!

07:48.420 --> 07:50.500
Oh! That was great, honey.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.540
I almost went to class.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.790
Chels, are you really
buyin' this?

07:54.790 --> 07:57.500
Yes, Rae,
yes, I am.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.290
Well, I know you're all
up to something,

08:02.290 --> 08:03.710
but I gotta go.

08:07.290 --> 08:08.920
-Goodbye.
-All righty.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.710
Okay.
Let's find the money
and get out.

08:14.580 --> 08:18.420
Now, if I were $10,000,
where would I be?

08:18.420 --> 08:21.000
If you were smart,
you'd be in a mutual fund

08:21.000 --> 08:22.830
that provides
long-term earning potential.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.290
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with the bra drawer.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.040
Wait, wait.
Before we start looking,

08:28.040 --> 08:31.000
we should take a picture,
so we know exactly how
to put things back.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.250
That's ridiculous.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.920
I think we'll remember
where things were.

08:38.420 --> 08:39.790
The money's not here!

08:39.790 --> 08:41.250
Not here, either!

08:41.250 --> 08:42.750
Not here, either!

08:44.920 --> 08:47.250
Wait... wait,
Mom was wearing
her pink backpack

08:47.250 --> 08:48.120
when she left.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.830
What if she put the money
in there?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.500
Well, if she did,
my vision's gonna
come true,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.000
and our money's
as good as gone!

08:54.000 --> 08:55.250
No, we can't let that happen.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.830
Mom is counting on that money.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.380
I'm sorry, Booker,
but... you're gonna
have to tell Mom

09:01.380 --> 09:02.540
about your vision.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.460
Booker, I'm serious.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.000
You have to call Mom right now.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.120
Okay, fine.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.000
Hey, Mom?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.830
I-- I have something
to tell you...

09:25.540 --> 09:26.920
I'm psychic.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.830
Woman (recording):
Today's movie times
are 4:10, 7:30...

09:34.880 --> 09:38.790
Wow.
Looks like Mom got a new job
as a movie phone operator.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.330
Look, Nia, I-- I'm not
tellin' her.

09:45.830 --> 09:47.540
And you've gotta
have my back on this.

09:47.540 --> 09:50.210
Fine.
I got your back,
but we have to have

09:50.210 --> 09:52.330
Mom's back too
and rescue that money.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.210
Let's go!

09:57.500 --> 09:59.880
But first we gotta
put this room back together.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.960
It's a good thing
you took that before photo.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.290
You told me not to!

10:03.290 --> 10:04.960
Since when do you listen to me?

10:06.670 --> 10:09.540
Okay, all right.
We just have to figure out
a way to track down Mom.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.330
I got two words...

10:11.330 --> 10:13.500
zip... line.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.290
Yeah, zipline is one word.

10:15.290 --> 10:17.000
I wasn't finished.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.120
Zipline across the city,

10:19.120 --> 10:21.670
hypens in between
"across", "the",
and "city",

10:21.670 --> 10:23.750
making it all one word.

10:25.420 --> 10:26.830
Boom!

10:27.710 --> 10:30.830
Or we could use
the Scut tracking app
on my phone,

10:30.830 --> 10:34.790
locate Mom's car,
and take the money
when she's not looking.

10:35.670 --> 10:36.960
Boom!

10:36.960 --> 10:39.170
I like her "boom" better.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.750
Let's just go!

10:45.670 --> 10:48.000
Okay, we'wve really
gotta clean this room!

10:55.420 --> 10:57.750
Hello, welcome
to your Scut ride.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.960
I'm your Scut-er, Raven.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.960
Uh-uh, you can't
get in this car
with that greasy pizza.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.750
Unless you give me a slice.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.170
Where you goin'?

11:07.170 --> 11:08.540
Wait, where you goin'?

11:09.830 --> 11:12.880
That's okay.
I don't like grease anyway.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.330
Dang, I lied.
I love grease.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.000
I should really start
eating breakfast.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.960
Who wants to grow
big and strong for Mama?

11:24.960 --> 11:28.540
-I know you do.
-Are you talkin'
to that tomato?

11:29.170 --> 11:31.210
Yes.
Yes, I am.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.960
Talking to plants
really helps them grow.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.500
Uh, well, maybe you should
spend less time talkin'
to plants and more time

11:37.500 --> 11:39.620
talkin' to Levi.
Bada-boom!

11:39.620 --> 11:43.120
(laughs)
I see what you did there.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.670
And bada don't do it again.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.750
Hey!
Since you're up here,

11:47.750 --> 11:49.170
why don't you help me
garden, huh?

11:49.170 --> 11:51.210
Oh, sorry, I came up to hoop,
not scoop.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.380
Hoop? Hey, hey.
What if your ball
lands in my garden?

11:54.380 --> 11:57.170
Good point, you should probably
move your garden someplace else.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.170
Or you should
probably go to the park
and play hoop, hmm?

11:59.170 --> 12:01.040
Well, I'm not goin' to the park.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.250
Well, I'm not movin' my garden.

12:04.040 --> 12:08.290
Well, looks like
we've got ourselves...
a situation.

12:08.290 --> 12:12.210
Hmm, yeah, well, I do see
you have a ball in your hand.

12:12.210 --> 12:14.920
Let's see if you're
any good at it.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.170
Winner rules the roof,
all right?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.710
If you win, I stay
out of your way.

12:17.710 --> 12:20.620
If I win,
you have to help me garden.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.960
(laughs)
You're challenging me?

12:25.170 --> 12:27.250
Well, I'm not talkin'
to my to-mah-toes.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.960
Hey, welcome to your Scut ride.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.880
I'm your Scut-er-- Raven!

12:35.250 --> 12:37.040
Actually, it's a falcon.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.290
Oh, well, that's great,
I don't do birds.

12:39.290 --> 12:42.620
Oh, all right,
well, I'll just take
my bird,

12:42.620 --> 12:44.290
and my leftover meatloaf
and go--

12:44.290 --> 12:46.420
Wait, now hold up, now,
hold up, you got meatloaf?

12:46.420 --> 12:49.000
-Mm-hm.
-Your bird can stay
if you give me a little nibble

12:49.000 --> 12:50.620
of that loaf.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.420
-Long as he doesn't hurt me.
-Oh, don't worry,
you'll be fine.

12:53.420 --> 12:55.750
As long as you don't
look Ernesto in the eyes.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.120
Okay, no problem.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.790
Are you looking him
in the eyes right now?

13:11.790 --> 13:12.960
No! No, no, no, no, no.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.880
No.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.080
Loaf me.

13:19.210 --> 13:21.380
(falcon screeches)

13:21.380 --> 13:23.170
The Raven is on the move.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.250
She just made a right turn
down a-- one way street?

13:26.250 --> 13:28.290
No, that's a--
that's a sidewalk!

13:28.290 --> 13:30.170
Why is she driving like that?

13:30.170 --> 13:31.790
I told you not to look him
in the eyes!

13:31.790 --> 13:34.170
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
-(falcon screeching)

13:36.790 --> 13:38.210
It looks like she's
coming this way!

13:38.210 --> 13:40.460
Yeah, if she doesn't
drive into the river!

13:40.460 --> 13:43.330
Okay, there's a stop sign
on the corner, that's when
we make our move.

13:43.330 --> 13:44.750
Well, let's save that money!

13:50.120 --> 13:52.170
You think that try-hard outfit's
gonna help?

13:53.120 --> 13:56.080
I don't need
any help, all right?
Just give me the rock.

14:01.880 --> 14:02.830
Yeah!

14:04.920 --> 14:06.420
Who are you?

14:07.120 --> 14:10.080
They call me
the Tomato Tornado.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.210
-(falcon screeches)
-Aah! Okay! Okay!

14:13.210 --> 14:15.000
You, the bird,
not the meatloaf,
get out!

14:15.000 --> 14:17.750
You can't let me out here!
This is a dangerous
neighborhood!

14:17.750 --> 14:19.170
This is my neighborhood!

14:19.170 --> 14:20.580
Well, then, you should get out!

14:20.580 --> 14:22.170
-Aah! Oh! Ooh!
-(screeching)

14:24.380 --> 14:25.120
(screams)

14:26.210 --> 14:28.420
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

14:29.250 --> 14:31.120
Get out! Get out, now!

14:33.330 --> 14:35.210
-(screeching)
-(screaming)

14:36.170 --> 14:38.040
If you and that bird
don't get out this car,

14:38.040 --> 14:40.460
I'm gonna roll this window
down and both of y'all are
flyin' out!

14:40.460 --> 14:42.000
Don't you dare
lower that window!

14:42.000 --> 14:43.380
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

14:45.040 --> 14:45.960
Okay! Okay!

14:50.000 --> 14:51.380
Ernesto, no!

14:51.380 --> 14:52.710
(Ernesto screeching)

14:55.290 --> 14:57.540
You just made
the wrong enemy, lady!

14:57.540 --> 14:59.120
I'm not scared of you.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.080
Oh, not me... Ernesto!

15:08.080 --> 15:09.460
♪ Who has got the
backpack? ♪

15:09.460 --> 15:11.790
Both:
♪ You do! You do! ♪

15:11.790 --> 15:13.460
♪ Who has got
sweet ninja moves? ♪

15:13.460 --> 15:15.250
Both:
♪ You do! You do! ♪

15:16.960 --> 15:18.460
♪ Who forgot to tie his shoes? ♪

15:18.460 --> 15:20.500
♪ I did! I did! ♪

15:21.170 --> 15:23.250
Okay.
Now we need to figure out
where to hide it

15:23.250 --> 15:25.330
so Mom can't find it
and lose it.

15:25.330 --> 15:27.960
Oh! I got it!
How about under her bed?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.580
That's the first place
she'll look.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.830
Okay, well, then,
how about under
your mom's bed?

15:31.830 --> 15:34.290
My mom's bed
is under your mom's bed.

15:34.290 --> 15:36.920
Okay, guys, it should be
someplace she's not
going to look.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.250
Someplace she hates.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.250
Oh! I got it.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.580
How about the bathroom
after I've been in it?

15:42.580 --> 15:45.330
Yeah, someplace she hates,
but can still breathe.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.250
This is perfect!

15:50.250 --> 15:52.380
We'll bury it in the dirt.
Mom hates dirt.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.790
Yeah.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.120
What's goin' on
over there?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.620
Oh, just my mom schooling Tess.

15:58.380 --> 16:01.750
They call me the Bus Driver,
'cause I take the kids
to school.

16:01.750 --> 16:02.920
What?

16:06.170 --> 16:07.170
See?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.420
The things I do
for meatloaf.

16:20.420 --> 16:22.210
Oh, yeah.

16:22.210 --> 16:23.920
Every little nibble,
nibble, nibble.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.380
Where's my backpack?

16:31.380 --> 16:32.830
Pinky?

16:32.830 --> 16:34.290
Pinky?

16:34.290 --> 16:35.460
Pinky!

16:35.460 --> 16:36.460
Pinky!

16:36.460 --> 16:37.500
Pinky!

16:41.290 --> 16:43.080
Turn the oven down low,

16:43.080 --> 16:45.460
and get ready to take
the mushroom quiche out,

16:45.460 --> 16:49.420
because you are... done!

16:49.420 --> 16:51.500
What? What? What?
What? What?

16:52.290 --> 16:53.420
Let's go!

16:53.420 --> 16:54.330
Maybe we should wait.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.040
She's makin' mushroom quiche!

16:57.710 --> 17:00.670
It's very good.
It's the one thing
she can cook.

17:00.670 --> 17:03.380
Hey, Quiche Club,
meeting's over!

17:04.500 --> 17:08.080
Back it up, back it up.
Oh! Look!

17:08.880 --> 17:11.380
Man, I should've
had a dance contest!

17:11.380 --> 17:13.460
Oh, honey,
you would've lost that, too!

17:14.420 --> 17:15.960
What? Yeah!

17:15.960 --> 17:17.380
Happy gardening!

17:19.420 --> 17:22.000
What? Aah!

17:22.000 --> 17:25.250
Pinky!
Pinky, where are you?

17:25.250 --> 17:27.380
Who took you, Pinky?

17:32.380 --> 17:34.210
(growls) Ernesto.

17:39.460 --> 17:43.420
I'm comin' for you, Ernesto!

17:44.380 --> 17:49.580
-We did it!
Mom's money is safe and sound!
-Zipline, here we come!

17:49.580 --> 17:50.960
Both:
Ah!

17:50.960 --> 17:55.170
And, hey!
You didn't even have to tell Mom
you're psychic, Mr. Superhero.

17:55.170 --> 17:58.670
Yeah, but... I-- I still wish
I had my fangs, I--

17:58.670 --> 18:02.040
I was literally this close
to being a psychic vampire.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.420
I "vant" to see your future.

18:11.460 --> 18:13.670
How does she ball like that?

18:16.120 --> 18:21.000
Red-headed, long-armed,
tomato-talkin' freak!

18:23.080 --> 18:24.620
What was that?

18:28.620 --> 18:30.460
All:
Pinky!

18:37.500 --> 18:40.420
How did Pinky
get thrown off the roof?

18:41.460 --> 18:44.540
It doesn't matter.
We just need to get Pinky
out of that cement

18:44.540 --> 18:45.710
before it dries.
Come on!

18:49.540 --> 18:51.460
-Nice carrots, Mom!
-Thanks.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.500
Oh, no!

18:56.000 --> 18:57.540
We are gonna
get in so much trouble!

18:57.540 --> 19:00.170
No, no, no, we're fine,
as long as we can
get it out

19:00.170 --> 19:01.540
before the cement dries.

19:01.540 --> 19:02.620
Okay.

19:05.460 --> 19:09.500
Aah! How? It's too far away
for one of us to reach it.

19:11.290 --> 19:13.380
But not for all three of us.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.500
Why am I always on the end
of the human chain?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.000
'Cause you're the lightest.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.790
I really gotta start bulkin' up.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.580
Got it!

19:35.540 --> 19:36.880
Raven:
Stupid, nasty bird!

19:36.880 --> 19:38.920
-(gasps)
-Both: Mom!

19:38.920 --> 19:40.460
-Hey, kids.
-Hi, Mom.

19:40.460 --> 19:41.540
What's good?

19:51.670 --> 19:53.500
Okay, what's goin' on?

19:53.500 --> 19:55.670
Nothin'.
Nothin', just enjoyin'
the outdoors.

19:55.670 --> 19:57.920
You always say
go play outside.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.380
I also say go clean your room,
but you never do that.

20:00.380 --> 20:04.380
Uh, Ma-- Ma, are you okay?
You got a little crazy
in your eye.

20:04.380 --> 20:08.620
If you must know,
Pinky got stolen.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.420
-Oh, no!
-Not Pinky.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.920
-Who'd do such a thing?
-I know exactly who!

20:12.920 --> 20:15.250
-You do?
-I do. This--

20:15.250 --> 20:17.710
thievin'... dirty...

20:17.710 --> 20:19.040
I'm sorry!

20:19.040 --> 20:20.080
About what?

20:21.210 --> 20:25.580
Sorry... I cut you off!
You were saying?

20:25.580 --> 20:28.290
I was saying
that this falcon
named Ernesto

20:28.290 --> 20:29.540
stole Pinky!

20:30.460 --> 20:32.670
You should go report this
to the bird police.

20:32.670 --> 20:35.290
Oh, yeah.
Or-- Or the F-Beak-I.

20:35.290 --> 20:38.750
(all laughing)

20:38.750 --> 20:41.000
I know y'all are up
to somethin', all right?

20:42.710 --> 20:44.750
I just gotta go.
Mother nature's callin'.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.250
Oh, you gotta go
to the bathroom?

20:46.250 --> 20:48.460
No, it's Chelsea,
the urban gardener.

20:51.670 --> 20:55.540
Oh, wow.
I-- I can't believe we actually
got away with that.

20:55.540 --> 20:58.120
Did we?
Did we really?

21:04.670 --> 21:07.500
The Bus Driver,
where does she
come up with that?

21:08.580 --> 21:11.620
Well, looks who's
talkin' to tomatoes now.

21:13.170 --> 21:15.790
If there's one thing I hate
more than dirt, it's Ernesto!

21:15.790 --> 21:17.620
Having man trouble, Ms. B?

21:17.620 --> 21:20.460
Ernesto's a bird, ya nosey.

21:21.580 --> 21:25.620
I can't believe that feathered
raccoon came into my car
and stole Pinky!

21:25.620 --> 21:27.330
Have a tiny asparagus, Rae.

21:27.330 --> 21:28.830
It really helps
with the stress, huh?

21:30.380 --> 21:32.580
Now, let's use some
of your mom's tools

21:32.580 --> 21:34.580
to chisel you outta there
before they find out--

21:35.580 --> 21:39.250
that we're making
the Statue of Levi
for them!

21:39.790 --> 21:41.620
Levi, what happened, honey,
are you okay?

21:41.620 --> 21:43.540
Is that Pinky in there?

21:43.540 --> 21:47.170
Rae, that's not nice.
He's very sensitive
to the sun.

21:47.170 --> 21:49.920
Not your pale kid,
my backpack, get back.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.620
Can somebody
explain this, please?

21:52.620 --> 21:54.580
I got my own problems.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.210
-We, uh--
-Kind of stole your backpack.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.750
Why would you steal my backpack?

22:00.750 --> 22:04.460
Because... we knew
you were gonna lose it.

22:04.460 --> 22:06.540
How could you possibly
know that?

22:06.540 --> 22:10.710
-Uh...
-How could you possibly
know that, Booker?

22:10.710 --> 22:11.580
Nia? Hello!

22:12.880 --> 22:14.710
-Mom, I-- I--
-He means "we."

22:14.710 --> 22:18.170
No, Nia... I got this.

22:19.620 --> 22:23.040
Mom... this is not on her.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.710
And it's not "we."

22:26.460 --> 22:27.330
It's me.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.330
I knew you were gonna
lose the backpack

22:30.330 --> 22:31.830
because...

22:34.830 --> 22:36.170
I had a vision.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.250
I'm sorry,
what'd you just say?
You had a vision?

22:41.250 --> 22:44.620
Yeah, I-- I get
a lot of 'em.

22:44.620 --> 22:47.380
I-- I'm psychic.

22:47.380 --> 22:49.710
And it's not something
you can fix,

22:49.710 --> 22:52.670
or-- or file down,
or change.

22:52.670 --> 22:54.580
It's who I am, Mom.

22:54.580 --> 22:55.710
And I like it.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.080
He thinks he's a superhero.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.830
It sounds dumb
when she says it,

23:01.830 --> 23:03.040
but I kinda am.

23:05.540 --> 23:07.830
Oh, my baby has visions.

23:07.830 --> 23:09.080
-Did you hear that, Chels?
-Yeah, I heard it.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.540
My baby has visions.

23:10.540 --> 23:12.540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're happy, Mom?

23:12.540 --> 23:15.080
Yes, I'm happy about this!
You have visions!

23:15.080 --> 23:16.830
Oh, now we both--

23:16.830 --> 23:19.960
kind of know
where Pinky could be!

23:21.830 --> 23:24.880
-What? Tell them, Rae.
-No. Mm-mm.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.830
-But you have to tell--
-I don't have to tell
them anything.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.880
-Are you crazy?
-Mom!

23:28.880 --> 23:30.290
Tell us what?
