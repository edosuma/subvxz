(ALARM SOUNDS)

12:03.806 --> 12:05.543
Oh.

12:07.079 --> 12:08.392
Hey.

12:08.417 --> 12:11.275
Uh, forgive my bluntness. Just,
you know, circumstances.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.642
How are you here?

12:12.667 --> 12:14.552
Oh, you didn't order a blonde?

12:15.118 --> 12:16.498
(CHUCKLES)

12:16.639 --> 12:18.703
Guerin said it wasn't safe

12:18.728 --> 12:22.226
to talk at the cafe, so he sent me here.

12:24.150 --> 12:25.681
Liz,

12:26.105 --> 12:28.399
did something happen to Max?

12:40.291 --> 12:43.579
_

12:53.789 --> 12:55.592
Three years ago, I hypothesized

12:55.617 --> 12:57.407
that if I introduced a rare protein

12:57.432 --> 12:59.342
to destroyed stem cells,
they'd regenerate.

12:59.367 --> 13:00.749
And I was right.

13:00.774 --> 13:03.564
My team in Denver brought
dead cells back to life.

13:03.662 --> 13:05.936
Rat cells, but, I mean,
still, the applications are

13:06.011 --> 13:09.051
immeasurable... until our
study got shut down.

13:09.076 --> 13:10.366
They said it was for ethics reasons,

13:10.391 --> 13:12.376
but I think it's because
it threatened big pharma.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.514
Then a few weeks ago, Kyle found that

13:14.539 --> 13:17.639
the pods contain a sort of alien cousin

13:17.664 --> 13:19.092
to my regenerative protein.

13:19.117 --> 13:20.835
When Max healed Rosa,

13:20.860 --> 13:23.410
his electric charge
amplified the process.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.209
If we can replicate that, then,

13:25.234 --> 13:27.354
we can accelerate his recovery, so,

13:27.379 --> 13:29.452
I am testing out pig hearts to see...

13:29.477 --> 13:33.123
- Those are pig hearts?
- You think these are human hearts?

13:33.148 --> 13:34.210
I'm so sorry.

13:34.235 --> 13:36.195
Uh, sometimes I skip steps

13:36.220 --> 13:37.562
when I'm dumbing things down.

13:37.587 --> 13:40.007
- Not that you're dumb. It's just...
- No. All good.

13:40.032 --> 13:41.921
You know, I think it's safe to say

13:41.946 --> 13:44.038
we are different kinds of smart.

13:44.538 --> 13:46.063
You actually, um,

13:46.248 --> 13:48.561
remind me a lot of my sister Charlie.

13:48.670 --> 13:52.650
She used to rant about gene therapy,

13:52.675 --> 13:55.486
sliding around the kitchen in her socks.

13:57.873 --> 14:01.514
So all of this is going to save Max...

14:01.863 --> 14:03.351
unless it fails,

14:03.376 --> 14:05.246
in which case, um...

14:10.618 --> 14:12.132
We have a few hours

14:12.194 --> 14:16.069
before I need to record the
electromagnetic charge interval.

14:20.866 --> 14:23.253
(SIGHS) Do you want to?

14:23.370 --> 14:26.568
I'm just really not a wine person.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.898
Well, then, I am officially out of ideas

14:29.923 --> 14:32.093
on how to comfort my dead
boyfriend's ex-lover.

14:32.345 --> 14:34.485
I've got whiskey in the car.

14:35.451 --> 14:38.615
I'm sorry. I told them no
visitors until my brain

14:38.640 --> 14:40.309
starts to obey my orders.

14:40.334 --> 14:42.044
Well, your-your speech is improving.

14:42.069 --> 14:43.450
Eh.

14:43.475 --> 14:45.256
Look, Dad, I came to...

14:46.305 --> 14:49.225
to tell you that I'm
sorry about all of this.

14:54.431 --> 14:55.989
This is a morphine drip.

14:56.174 --> 14:58.645
Click it if you, uh... I know.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.356
I know what it does.

15:00.381 --> 15:01.957
Yeah, right.

15:02.567 --> 15:06.254
Well, I want you to know that
it's over between Guerin and me.

15:06.487 --> 15:08.362
I don't want to discuss that.

15:08.423 --> 15:10.353
WOMAN (OVER P.A.): Dr. Winston, pick up.

15:10.378 --> 15:11.748
Dr. Winston, pick up.

15:11.773 --> 15:13.099
Flint broke into the bunker.

15:13.124 --> 15:15.309
He left behind a bunch
of after action reports

15:15.334 --> 15:16.755
from the night of the crash.

15:16.780 --> 15:20.012
I think he was trying to get
me to understand why...

15:20.509 --> 15:21.974
Well, it worked.

15:22.011 --> 15:23.971
I get why you want to
eradicate them now.

15:23.996 --> 15:25.637
The violence that those aliens inflicted

15:25.662 --> 15:27.992
on those honest American soldiers

15:28.017 --> 15:30.302
that night is unforgivable.

15:30.327 --> 15:32.617
When I met Michael, I
didn't know what he was.

15:32.839 --> 15:34.221
But I do now.

15:36.091 --> 15:37.668
I'm sorry.

15:37.693 --> 15:39.393
Mm-hmm.

15:41.757 --> 15:43.630
You know, those bastards...

15:43.655 --> 15:46.615
They sent out one that
looked like a woman first,

15:46.709 --> 15:48.919
just to make sure

15:48.920 --> 15:51.260
our men lowered their
weapons, and they did.

15:51.611 --> 15:54.832
Our men who were still
recovering from World War II,

15:55.038 --> 15:57.038
just caught vulnerable.

15:57.342 --> 15:58.864
Disgusting.

15:59.779 --> 16:02.475
And Tripp was never the same.

16:02.845 --> 16:04.209
Who's Tripp?

16:11.531 --> 16:12.757
MAX: Rosa?

16:12.782 --> 16:15.047
(GASPS)

16:15.261 --> 16:17.051
- MAX: Help.

16:17.076 --> 16:18.724
You're the only one.

16:22.624 --> 16:25.189
CAMERON: When my sister
and I were little...

16:25.214 --> 16:28.203
- LIZ: Mm-hmm.
- Our Dad brought us to Roswell.

16:28.342 --> 16:32.142
We were obsessed with aliens

16:32.167 --> 16:34.207
(LAUGHING) and the crash

16:34.232 --> 16:35.865
and X-Files.

16:36.385 --> 16:38.994
And it was... it was the perfect trip.

16:39.701 --> 16:41.746
I think that's why I moved to Roswell.

16:42.254 --> 16:44.499
That's where I felt closest to her.

16:44.524 --> 16:46.042
It was like...

16:46.312 --> 16:49.117
trying to go back in time somehow.

16:49.257 --> 16:51.882
Time travel really messes with you.

16:53.819 --> 16:57.720
I am eight years older
than my older sister.

16:58.032 --> 17:01.046
She used to be my hero. She was kinetic,

17:01.071 --> 17:03.894
disruptive, cool.

17:04.239 --> 17:06.949
Now that I'm an adult,

17:06.973 --> 17:09.233
I'm-I'm pretty sure she's bipolar,

17:09.258 --> 17:11.067
and she needs help.

17:11.092 --> 17:13.444
And if I try to save Max,

17:13.470 --> 17:16.239
I-I'm letting Rosa
twist in the wind, so,

17:16.642 --> 17:18.742
hence the wine ready in my drawer.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.451
Yeah.

17:20.804 --> 17:25.082
Well, we all have our
unhealthy coping mechanisms.

17:25.214 --> 17:27.890
- Yup.
- You want to try mine?

17:31.444 --> 17:34.216
Well... (SNIFFLES)

17:34.371 --> 17:35.967
I'm puking,

17:35.992 --> 17:38.558
but still not bleeding, so,

17:38.583 --> 17:40.847
it's gonna be a long, bad day ahead.

17:41.656 --> 17:43.236
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

17:43.261 --> 17:44.834
How are you gonna know that what kills

17:44.859 --> 17:46.514
Noah's demon spawn won't kill you, too?

17:46.945 --> 17:48.359
I don't know.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.980
Did you know?

17:51.307 --> 17:54.235
Did you know that you were gonna die

17:54.337 --> 17:56.947
when you saved Rosa? I
mean, was there a moment

17:56.972 --> 17:58.740
that you realized...

18:00.679 --> 18:02.719
"This is going to kill me,"

18:03.086 --> 18:04.704
and you did it anyway?

18:04.943 --> 18:06.613
On the day my husband died.

18:06.638 --> 18:08.333
I wouldn't have left you, Iz.

18:08.358 --> 18:09.959
Hmm.

18:11.534 --> 18:12.835
That's exactly the kind

18:12.860 --> 18:15.466
of thing a figment of my
imagination would say.

18:17.911 --> 18:21.541
Deep down, you know I would
never choose anyone over you,

18:21.566 --> 18:24.016
because you would never
choose anyone over me.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.280
Not even yourself.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.337
You're training every
day because you want

18:28.362 --> 18:29.624
to be the one to bring me back,

18:29.649 --> 18:32.024
even if it costs you your life.

18:32.254 --> 18:33.656
Do you think I want to come back

No, I'm real. I'm here.

20:09.087 --> 20:11.196
The M.E., Dr. Holden,

20:11.221 --> 20:12.507
listed Noah's cause of death

20:12.532 --> 20:14.622
as cardiac arrest due
to lightning strike.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.897
No other abnormalities were listed.

20:16.922 --> 20:19.172

with the crime scene photos.

didn't have to do that.

just, he knew what he knew

22:05.085 --> 22:07.687

He never asked me.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.148
Would you have let him save her?

22:11.516 --> 22:13.436
If he had asked, I mean,

22:13.461 --> 22:15.194
would you really have stopped him?

22:21.763 --> 22:23.703
There are some choices

22:24.017 --> 22:26.332
people should never have to make.

You know, Max,

23:25.037 --> 23:27.367
you really should
loosen up a little bit.

23:27.392 --> 23:28.754
Do you know what hoverboarding is?

23:28.779 --> 23:31.067
'Cause I think it could really
help dislodge the stick...

23:31.092 --> 23:32.739
No, no. La, la, la, la. No, no, please.

23:32.764 --> 23:33.880
I already know way too...

23:33.905 --> 23:34.950
- I already know...
- You do know.

23:34.975 --> 23:36.200
- You were blaming Michael for so long.
- I can never get it

23:36.225 --> 23:38.528
out of my head because of you. Please.

23:39.841 --> 23:41.801
(CRYING)

23:44.457 --> 23:46.370
I miss you.

23:47.795 --> 23:49.653
Any time there's something...

23:49.877 --> 23:53.919
funny or Mom says something
extra or-or some...

23:54.164 --> 23:56.589
I go to call you or...

23:56.909 --> 24:00.425
I'll get in my car and start
driving to your house.

24:00.802 --> 24:03.136
My mind keeps reaching for you.

24:03.161 --> 24:08.265
It's like a reflex, you know,
when you love someone.

24:08.491 --> 24:10.142
There should be a word for it.

24:10.256 --> 24:12.270
You probably know the word for it.

24:15.661 --> 24:19.961
So when you lose your person, it's...

24:22.576 --> 24:24.894
the reflex doesn't get the memo.

24:25.003 --> 24:27.370
I keep reaching for you.

24:27.927 --> 24:31.498
I... open up a door

24:32.213 --> 24:37.003
and I slam into a brick wall.

24:38.583 --> 24:40.623
It doesn't matter how many times

24:40.725 --> 24:42.810
I slam into that wall, I just,

24:42.835 --> 24:46.847
I keep reaching for you,

24:47.151 --> 24:49.390
and then losing you.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.771
I lose you

24:53.238 --> 24:55.522
a hundred times a day.

25:04.542 --> 25:06.198
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

25:10.647 --> 25:13.998
(COUGHING)

25:16.748 --> 25:20.957
Where is the antidote? The
pregnancy is not over.

25:21.269 --> 25:23.870
I'll feel it when I'm free.

25:23.895 --> 25:25.020
I'll know.

25:25.045 --> 25:26.675
Your breath is shallow. Damn it, Isobel.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.168
This is not a good time to be alone.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.543
You know, the irony is, I'm not alone.

25:32.097 --> 25:36.714
For for the first time, I am
just like all the other girls.

25:36.739 --> 25:39.297
Did you know that our city council

25:39.409 --> 25:42.738
just passed a resolution
banning clinics?

25:42.878 --> 25:47.258
They call Roswell the last
sanctuary city for the unborn.

25:47.283 --> 25:48.621
Just the unborn.

25:48.646 --> 25:51.853
We don't have a women's shelter.

25:54.666 --> 25:56.761
Well, our parents sure
picked a fine place

25:56.786 --> 25:58.286
to crash a flying saucer.

25:59.399 --> 26:01.753
(GRUNTS, LAUGHS SOFTLY)

26:01.778 --> 26:03.572
(DOOR CLOSES)

26:03.865 --> 26:05.496
You okay, DeLuca?

26:05.521 --> 26:06.988
Uh, I-I was gonna give you space

26:07.013 --> 26:10.386
to... be with your mom,

26:10.411 --> 26:13.029
but there is something
I need to tell y...

26:19.472 --> 26:21.257
Is there?

26:22.087 --> 26:23.535
Just go. I was gonna talk to you.

26:23.574 --> 26:25.707
- How much do you know? Okay...
- Stop talking! Get out, Michael!

26:25.732 --> 26:28.533
- Okay! Okay! I'll go! But there's...
- Get out!

26:28.558 --> 26:29.760
- There's something you need to know.
- (SCREAMS)

26:29.785 --> 26:31.158
There's something you need to know.

26:31.183 --> 26:32.832
MAX: You remember when I used to come in

26:32.857 --> 26:34.731
- and sleep on your floor?
- (CHUCKLES)

26:34.803 --> 26:37.574
You-you used to have a nightmare.

26:37.599 --> 26:39.275
You, um...

26:39.985 --> 26:41.405
you were alone

26:41.430 --> 26:46.700
in a cold, dark room and
there was something...

26:46.897 --> 26:49.160
You couldn't get up. You were, uh...

26:49.185 --> 26:51.002
Chained to the floor.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.816
I'd wake up all freaked out

26:52.841 --> 26:54.220
and run to your room.

26:54.245 --> 26:56.109
- Mm.
- You'd make a little bed

26:56.134 --> 26:59.369
for me on the floor and
mind-meld me to a happy memory.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.345
You've always taken
such good care of me.

27:04.399 --> 27:06.177
Michael, too.

27:07.370 --> 27:10.724
I think you'd be a
really good mom, Isobel.

27:13.187 --> 27:15.149
You don't have to do this.

27:15.653 --> 27:17.437
Motherhood...

27:18.428 --> 27:22.068
isn't what this is about.

27:25.725 --> 27:28.235
I might want to be a mom someday. I...

27:28.861 --> 27:30.630
Not like this.

27:30.935 --> 27:35.525
Not when it's been... inflicted on me.

27:36.095 --> 27:38.767
I can't have Noah's baby. I...

27:39.017 --> 27:42.814
I can't recover from what he did

27:42.839 --> 27:45.382
until I put an end

27:45.583 --> 27:47.550
to the parts of him

27:47.911 --> 27:50.345
that are living inside of me.

27:50.546 --> 27:53.932
I have to do it on my own terms.
Do you get that?

27:54.707 --> 27:57.478
The only person

27:57.813 --> 28:00.313
who will always love me

28:00.859 --> 28:03.608
and come to my rescue

28:05.399 --> 28:07.195
is me.

28:08.241 --> 28:10.617
That's what this is about.

28:11.302 --> 28:13.077
Then you're doing the right thing.

28:13.102 --> 28:14.872
I know.

28:15.175 --> 28:17.435
Besides, if I were that
good at taking care of you,

28:17.460 --> 28:19.249
you'd have made it to 30.

28:20.756 --> 28:22.055
(GROANS)

28:22.484 --> 28:24.407
Oh, that's a lot of blood, Isobel.

28:24.432 --> 28:25.603
It's time.

28:25.628 --> 28:26.931
It's time. Come on, get up.

28:26.956 --> 28:28.619
Get up. Take the an...

28:30.764 --> 28:32.517
- Come on, Isobel, get up.
- (GROANING)

28:32.542 --> 28:34.080
Get up, get up, get up.

28:35.242 --> 28:38.644
Come on, Isobel. Take
the antidote, please.

28:49.481 --> 28:51.656
MAX: I need your help, Rosa.

28:52.425 --> 28:54.368
Look, I'm not gonna help you die.

28:54.393 --> 28:56.673
I have been drinking
so that I don't dream.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.872
- I-I know that.
- It's like you're getting stronger.

28:58.897 --> 29:00.564
I-I hear you now when I'm awake.

29:00.589 --> 29:02.089
You're right.

29:02.233 --> 29:04.573
Something is-is making me stronger.

29:04.598 --> 29:06.839
I f... I feel things.

29:07.048 --> 29:08.632
That's why I'm calling for you.

29:08.657 --> 29:10.309
Something is wrong with Isobel.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.958
Even in the pod, I s... I sense it.

29:12.983 --> 29:14.270
She's dying.

29:14.295 --> 29:15.715
Please.

29:17.046 --> 29:18.676
It's a thing.

29:18.707 --> 29:21.387
I like simple.

29:21.412 --> 29:24.315
Good banter, taller than me.

29:24.340 --> 29:25.512
Yes.

29:25.537 --> 29:27.762
- Makes coffee when he gets up.
- (SIGHS): Ah.

29:27.787 --> 29:30.446
You know, that's what I
liked about Max. He just,

29:30.471 --> 29:32.934
he didn't seem like the grand-gesture,

29:33.120 --> 29:35.830
- resurrect-the-dead type.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

29:35.855 --> 29:40.458
And when you found out he was
an alien, kind of a turnoff?

29:40.561 --> 29:44.146
By the time I found out,
it didn't really matter.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.295
You were here.

29:47.686 --> 29:50.365
How did you feel, when he told you?

29:50.390 --> 29:53.344
I mean, I always dreamed
about leaving Roswell

29:53.384 --> 29:55.037
to find something greater.

29:55.062 --> 29:57.068
Turns out there's a door to the universe

29:57.093 --> 29:58.883
right here all along.

29:58.908 --> 30:00.392
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

30:01.091 --> 30:02.787
It made you love him more.

30:02.887 --> 30:07.566
I fell for him after I knew the truth.

30:08.482 --> 30:10.611
(LAUGHS)

30:12.023 --> 30:13.542
It's like you said.

30:13.567 --> 30:14.943
We're different kinds of smart.

30:14.968 --> 30:17.033
Maybe we're different
kinds of dumb, too.

30:17.058 --> 30:18.308
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Liz, um, I just saw Max in
a nightmare and he said

30:28.507 --> 30:30.692
that Isobel needed help. I
think you should go get her.

30:30.717 --> 30:32.186
It's just a dream, Rosa.

30:32.211 --> 30:33.781
- Are you okay?
- What if it's not just a dream?

30:33.806 --> 30:36.512
Okay. Okay. I'm-I'm-I'm
getting in the car.

30:38.746 --> 30:41.367
Ooh, God. No, I am not. I am hammered.

30:41.392 --> 30:45.772
(EXHALES) Well, I can drive.

30:46.901 --> 30:48.877
Yeah, sorry, I, uh...

30:48.902 --> 30:51.662
Seemed like you needed
to tie one on and,

30:51.687 --> 30:54.607
no offense, but I was
not going to be drunk

30:54.632 --> 30:56.070
around you and a firearm.

(PANTING)

31:24.410 --> 31:26.875
I'm sorry that you had to get involved.

31:26.900 --> 31:29.830
No. I'd have been here. I...

31:31.911 --> 31:34.094
I know you're angry, and I get it.

31:34.119 --> 31:36.305
I-I got my sister back, and
you lost your brother.

31:36.330 --> 31:37.813
I think about that every day, I do.

31:37.838 --> 31:40.185
No. Oh, my God. It's not your fault.

31:40.423 --> 31:42.104
They...

31:43.007 --> 31:45.733
I didn't want to be mad
at Max, and so I...

31:46.770 --> 31:48.735
tried to blame you, but it...

31:50.624 --> 31:52.044
didn't work.

31:52.230 --> 31:54.065
I can't believe that you saved my life

31:54.090 --> 31:56.782
- after I was such a "see you next..."
- Stop.

31:56.807 --> 31:59.017
Please stop apologizing.

32:09.877 --> 32:13.547
I needed... Max.

32:16.641 --> 32:18.641
You had him.

32:19.045 --> 32:21.925
He was, he was with you.
Ma-Max was here.

32:22.118 --> 32:23.693
Michael built a rig.

32:23.718 --> 32:25.566
I think Max is getting
stronger in the pod.

32:25.591 --> 32:27.222
He felt that you needed him.

32:27.247 --> 32:28.925
He reached out. He-he got you help.

32:28.950 --> 32:31.759
Wait, what? H-How is that possible?
That...

32:31.784 --> 32:33.087
I'm gonna explain

32:33.112 --> 32:34.504
everything,

32:34.529 --> 32:36.417
but the important thing

32:36.624 --> 32:39.847
is that you know he
hasn't left you alone.

32:40.136 --> 32:43.050
He never did. He never will.

32:43.075 --> 32:44.582
So...

32:45.774 --> 32:47.909
I would have died,

32:49.344 --> 32:50.764
otherwise.

32:50.811 --> 32:52.972
If I didn't have some kind of

32:53.056 --> 32:57.471
half-dead alien twin, I...

33:00.962 --> 33:02.816

are just really good liars.

Oh, Cameron told me she found Mimi.

33:46.686 --> 33:48.062
Don't.

33:49.136 --> 33:50.989
You have no idea how bad I wanted

33:51.014 --> 33:53.144
- to tell you everything.
- Because I deserved to know,

33:53.169 --> 33:54.856
or because you needed my support?

33:54.881 --> 33:56.247
You know, I have pieced together

33:56.272 --> 33:57.522
one hell of a story

33:57.547 --> 33:58.864
between Michael and Rosa.

33:58.889 --> 34:00.639
Never mind that my mom's

34:00.664 --> 34:03.164
disappearance might have
something to do with them.

34:03.189 --> 34:04.802
But I was targeted, too.

34:04.827 --> 34:06.697
Last year, at the gala,
I woke up thinking

34:06.722 --> 34:09.543
I'd made a drunken fool
of myself, when actually,

34:09.795 --> 34:11.629
it was my closest friends
making a fool of me.

We thought you were safer
if you didn't know.

34:13.559 --> 34:15.777
Everyone who knew nearly
died 'cause of Noah.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.803
I never feel safe in this town.

34:17.828 --> 34:21.368
I keep a taser behind the

34:21.393 --> 34:23.402
You understand what it's like

34:23.428 --> 34:26.387
to be scared, and you
left me vulnerable.

34:26.411 --> 34:30.106
No, I-I kept the secret so that
you wouldn't be more vulnerable.

Last week, I went to
Rosa's grave to clean it.

34:35.755 --> 34:38.154
I sat and I talked to her spirit,

34:38.179 --> 34:40.281
like I have every month

34:40.811 --> 34:42.784
for ten years.

34:44.058 --> 34:45.871
I grieved her

34:50.476 --> 34:52.476
I just need some time.

35:23.590 --> 35:24.876
various vulnerabilities.

35:24.901 --> 35:26.228
I was trying to get him to tell me

35:26.253 --> 35:28.345
what his grandfather Harlan
told him about what happened

35:28.370 --> 35:29.957
the night of the crash.

35:30.031 --> 35:32.167
My dad kept talking about
a guy named Tripp.

35:32.351 --> 35:34.853
Tripp is a nickname for a soldier.

35:34.886 --> 35:36.714
His real name is redacted, but

35:36.739 --> 35:39.260
in his report of that night
there's a female alien, and

35:39.285 --> 35:42.572
I think that her description
matches your mother's.

35:42.702 --> 35:44.680
He said that she used her mind

35:44.705 --> 35:47.183
to control him and then got away.

35:47.716 --> 35:49.994
(GRUNTS)

35:56.376 --> 35:59.527
TRIPP: I thought the girl got
away, but we found her again.

35:59.552 --> 36:01.557
It was near dawn. We'd been assigned

36:01.582 --> 36:03.783
to patrol the perimeter of Walker,

36:03.808 --> 36:05.493
but my men and I ventured off a bit.

36:05.518 --> 36:08.533
The flying saucer wreckage was
scattered for miles anyway.

36:08.780 --> 36:10.539
I'm gonna try something.

36:10.564 --> 36:12.564
Yeah, try a bullet. It's a demon.

36:12.589 --> 36:14.017
The nurse you met at the Wild Pony

36:14.042 --> 36:16.101
last night was a demon, Stan;

36:16.700 --> 36:18.672
this one's a wounded deer.

36:18.697 --> 36:20.425
Stand down

36:20.450 --> 36:22.259
and stay back.

36:30.292 --> 36:32.134
I come in peace.

36:38.729 --> 36:40.735
We had a moment back there, didn't we?

36:40.962 --> 36:42.818
I think you're here
because you need help,

36:42.843 --> 36:45.103
not because you want to
hurt the American people.

36:45.198 --> 36:46.608
That sound right?

36:47.453 --> 36:48.993
I can see that you're hurt.

36:49.018 --> 36:50.829
You're not gonna last
much longer out here.

36:50.854 --> 36:52.104
That's a lot of blood.

36:52.129 --> 36:53.839
Can I take a look?

36:53.947 --> 36:55.793
I'm a medic.

37:08.273 --> 37:10.939
- (GASPS)
- Move in.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.691
SOLDIER: Holy heaven above.

37:18.916 --> 37:20.917
TRIPP: They were like
something out of a painting,

37:20.942 --> 37:22.782
something not of this earth.

37:22.915 --> 37:25.245
None of us had ever seen
light like that before.

37:25.270 --> 37:27.281
Could be weapons. Get 'em to the hold.

37:27.306 --> 37:29.155
There's no use fighting.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.444
We're gonna get you in this truck

37:30.469 --> 37:31.913
and we're gonna take you to the base.

37:31.938 --> 37:35.707
- (HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)
- (SOLDIERS SCREAMING)

37:39.449 --> 37:41.379
Don't shoot.

37:41.835 --> 37:44.592
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)

37:51.435 --> 37:52.950
Ah!

38:05.864 --> 38:08.657
(TRUCK ENGINE STARTS)

38:08.682 --> 38:10.241
TRIPP: I saw it then,

38:10.266 --> 38:11.936
their precious cargo.

38:12.150 --> 38:15.157
There were children in
those eggs, babies.

38:15.367 --> 38:18.333
You know a mother fighting for
her baby when you see one.

38:18.358 --> 38:20.461
Doesn't matter what species they are.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
That was 12 hours ago, sir.

38:22.525 --> 38:24.922
I expect they're long dead.

38:25.185 --> 38:27.293
You knew she fought for you.

38:27.414 --> 38:28.931
And even that day in the prison,

38:28.956 --> 38:30.679
I could tell how much she loved you.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.806
You think the blonde who
got shot in the chest

38:33.993 --> 38:35.700
is Max and Isobel's mother?

38:35.725 --> 38:38.270
I haven't seen anything in the drives

38:38.295 --> 38:40.317
that suggests that the
other woman lived,

38:40.342 --> 38:42.649
but I'm gonna keep looking.

38:43.643 --> 38:45.818
Did you read the last part?

38:46.133 --> 38:49.395
"I apologize for my failure
to eliminate the enemy

38:49.420 --> 38:51.449
"and deliver the bodies.

38:51.806 --> 38:54.216
It won't happen again."

38:54.388 --> 38:57.664
What kind of a monster

38:58.743 --> 39:01.163
talks like that about a dying mother?

39:13.017 --> 39:14.897
I'm sorry.

39:16.318 --> 39:17.738
Liz, I messed up.

39:17.763 --> 39:19.474
I couldn't do it. I couldn't stay clean.

39:19.499 --> 39:20.999
Look, I know that you hate me,

39:21.024 --> 39:22.444
and you should, because...

39:22.469 --> 39:25.089
because he's-he's dead because of me,

39:25.114 --> 39:26.994
and I don't even deserve it.

39:27.019 --> 39:29.759
I ruined it. I ruined everything.
I ruined

39:29.784 --> 39:31.914
- my miracle, Liz.
- Hey.

39:31.939 --> 39:34.318
- Come here.

No.

I want to show you this.

40:15.020 --> 40:17.088
I've been going through the
microfiche at the library.

40:17.113 --> 40:19.393
Every damn page of the
Gazette following the crash,

40:19.418 --> 40:21.542
looking for her name, for someone

40:21.567 --> 40:22.850
who fits her description.

40:22.875 --> 40:24.230
October 12, 1948.

to smiling next to a
prize-winning pumpkin

40:34.450 --> 40:37.055
to an alien torture chamber in a year?

40:39.338 --> 40:42.268
If they loved us, if they fought for us,

40:42.692 --> 40:46.230
why'd we wake up 50 years later
scared and completely alone?

40:47.917 --> 40:50.235
Why didn't they come for us?

more to this story.
