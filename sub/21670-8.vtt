00:00.791 --> 00:02.691
<i>Previously on
Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.692 --> 00:03.926
Now, let's go.

00:03.927 --> 00:05.261
The Chinese food challenge...

00:05.262 --> 00:06.762
Not gonna lie, I've never
made a chow mein, guys.

00:06.763 --> 00:08.430
Came down to the final dish.

00:08.431 --> 00:09.832
It all comes down
to the chow mein.

00:09.833 --> 00:10.833
And the men...

00:10.834 --> 00:11.834
The blue team!

00:11.835 --> 00:12.968
Yes!

00:12.969 --> 00:14.470
Won their first challenge ever.

00:14.471 --> 00:16.839
Thank you, lord.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.507
And got a day
out of Hell's Kitchen.

00:18.508 --> 00:20.910
It was fun shooting Dan.
So therapeutic.

00:20.911 --> 00:23.612
I loved it.

00:23.613 --> 00:25.848
At dinner service...

00:25.849 --> 00:27.183
Jessica...
Yes, chef?

00:27.184 --> 00:28.684
Halibut is raw.

00:28.685 --> 00:30.486
Jessica went
belly-up on the fish station.

00:30.487 --> 00:32.488
It's raw!

00:32.488 --> 00:33.956
Get a grip!

00:33.957 --> 00:35.691
And Susan
couldn't handle the meat.

00:37.027 --> 00:38.427
Oh,.

00:38.428 --> 00:40.029
I just dropped my lamb, guys.

00:41.565 --> 00:42.598
In the blue kitchen...

00:42.599 --> 00:43.866
Beautifully cooked.
Thank you, chef.

00:43.867 --> 00:45.901
Dan was a surprising star.

00:45.902 --> 00:47.770
Winner. I'm like Charlie sheen.

00:47.771 --> 00:49.171
All I do is win.

00:49.172 --> 00:51.140
But Ray's tableside dumplings...

00:51.141 --> 00:52.408
I'll take this back.

00:52.409 --> 00:54.843
This is cold now, chef.
Oh, off, Ray.

00:54.844 --> 00:56.445
And Barret's fish...

00:56.446 --> 00:57.680
Hey, all of you, come here.

00:57.681 --> 00:59.248
Ultimately sank the blue team.

00:59.249 --> 01:00.249
Look. Paper.

01:00.250 --> 01:03.252
Oh, my God.

01:03.253 --> 01:05.654
Chef Ramsay declared
no winner for dinner service.

01:05.655 --> 01:09.325
Nominate your two weakest chefs
for elimination.

01:09.326 --> 01:10.626
The men saw an opportunity

01:10.627 --> 01:12.328
to get rid
of a contentious teammate.

01:12.329 --> 01:14.363
The person that we
should be putting up right now

01:14.364 --> 01:15.898
<i>would be Dan.</i>

01:15.899 --> 01:17.166
What?

01:17.167 --> 01:18.601
And put him up for elimination.

01:18.602 --> 01:20.469
The team's first nominee
is myself, chef.

01:20.470 --> 01:21.971
This sucks.
Along with...

01:21.972 --> 01:23.072
Raymond, chef.

01:23.073 --> 01:24.073
While the women put up...

01:24.074 --> 01:25.074
Susan...

01:25.075 --> 01:26.542
And...
Jessica.

01:26.543 --> 01:27.643
In the end, it was Jessica...

01:27.644 --> 01:28.978
Give me your jacket, please.

01:28.979 --> 01:30.896
Whose dream
of becoming head chef

01:30.897 --> 01:33.799
at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill
at Caesars Palace...

01:33.800 --> 01:35.668
was shattered.

01:39.205 --> 01:40.606
* Fire

01:40.607 --> 01:42.841
Whoa.

01:42.842 --> 01:45.778
* The way you swerve and curve

01:45.779 --> 01:47.613
* really wrecks my nerves

01:47.614 --> 01:49.982
* and I'm so excited, child
ohh!

01:49.983 --> 01:52.117
<i>Go, Jon!</i>

01:52.118 --> 01:54.954
* When you take
what you've got *

01:54.955 --> 01:56.922
* and, girl, you've got a lot

01:56.923 --> 02:01.226
* you're really smokin', child

02:01.227 --> 02:04.196
* when you're hot, you're hot

02:04.197 --> 02:06.031
* you really shoot your shot

02:06.032 --> 02:07.933
* you're dynamite, child

02:07.934 --> 02:09.735
* yeah

02:09.735 --> 02:12.805
* well, I can tell
by your game *

02:12.806 --> 02:15.608
* you're gonna start a flame

02:15.609 --> 02:18.677
* love, baby, baby

02:18.678 --> 02:22.181
* the way you push, push

02:22.182 --> 02:23.782
* lets me know that

02:23.783 --> 02:25.150
Hey, hey!

02:25.151 --> 02:26.218
* You're good

02:26.219 --> 02:27.286
* you're gonna get your wish

02:27.287 --> 02:29.154
* oh, no

02:29.155 --> 02:30.923
* fire

02:30.924 --> 02:32.891
* what I said, child

02:32.892 --> 02:36.228
* oww, fire

02:36.229 --> 02:38.097
* uh-huh

02:38.098 --> 02:42.034
* got me burnin',
got me burnin' *

02:43.637 --> 02:46.905
<i>And now the continuation
of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:46.906 --> 02:49.108
Now off.

02:50.610 --> 02:51.744
I'm so sorry, you guys.

02:51.745 --> 02:53.946
I will not disappoint you
ever again.

02:53.947 --> 02:55.147
I can cook.

02:55.148 --> 02:57.416
Get ready,
'cause Dan's gonna be

02:57.417 --> 02:58.717
worser than ever
to deal with.

02:58.718 --> 03:00.085
You guys know that, right?

03:00.086 --> 03:02.221
I don't know how Dan
keeps dodging the bullet.

03:02.222 --> 03:03.989
Chef Ramsay said,
"You can cook,"

03:03.990 --> 03:06.291
but it's because
we saved his ass tonight.

03:06.292 --> 03:07.893
But what made
this even way worser is,

03:07.894 --> 03:10.396
chef Ramsay told him
he could cook good.

03:10.397 --> 03:12.197
Couldn't have been
further from the truth.

03:12.198 --> 03:13.799
That felt so good.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.968
"You can cook."
Oh, my God.

03:15.969 --> 03:18.637
He said that
in front of everybody,

03:18.638 --> 03:21.240
so will you all take me
a little more seriously now?

03:21.241 --> 03:22.408
I'm just gonna go ahead
and just do one of these.

03:22.409 --> 03:24.043
Good job, Dan.
Good job.

03:24.044 --> 03:25.244
Way to take it home.

03:25.245 --> 03:28.981
I'm about to cheers myself
on this one.

03:28.982 --> 03:30.416
I'm glad you're here.
Thank you.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.117
You can tell
the passion is there.

03:32.118 --> 03:35.387
I mean, I am over the moon
with joy

03:35.388 --> 03:36.622
that I'm still here
in Hell's Kitchen.

03:36.623 --> 03:37.956
I sucked tonight.

03:37.957 --> 03:39.324
Somebody else
is gonna up,

03:39.325 --> 03:41.927
and we gonna be
in this boat again.

03:41.928 --> 03:44.063
It will not happen again.

03:44.064 --> 03:45.364
Even though I don't have

03:45.365 --> 03:46.532
as much experience
in the kitchen,

03:46.533 --> 03:48.934
I cannot wait
to prove to my team

03:48.935 --> 03:50.569
that I deserve to be here.

03:50.570 --> 03:52.104
<i>We are definitely winning
the next challenge</i>

03:52.105 --> 03:53.472
<i>'cause those can't get
their together.</i>

03:55.575 --> 03:57.676
With one more dinner
service under their belts,

03:57.677 --> 03:59.244
the chefs get ready to turn in,

03:59.245 --> 04:01.313
one still reliving the day...

04:01.314 --> 04:03.582
I drove it home like a champ.

04:03.583 --> 04:06.652
And another
grateful that it's over.

04:06.653 --> 04:07.653
It's been one hell of a day.

04:11.725 --> 04:14.727
But in Hell's Kitchen,
there's no rest for the weary.

04:14.728 --> 04:15.828
Rise and shine.

04:15.829 --> 04:19.964
Let's go.
All of you.

04:19.966 --> 04:22.968
We have an amazing selection
of ingredients,

04:22.969 --> 04:25.270
and these ingredients
are the freshest

04:25.271 --> 04:26.472
you'll ever see.

04:26.473 --> 04:28.040
Ooh, what's that smell?

04:28.041 --> 04:29.975
<i>Let's go.
</i>

04:29.976 --> 04:31.977
Line up, please, guys.

04:31.978 --> 04:33.712
<i> What?</i>

04:33.713 --> 04:36.448
Yay!

04:36.449 --> 04:38.383
I see farm animals!

04:38.384 --> 04:39.718
<i>Yeehaw!
Mary...</i>

04:39.719 --> 04:40.986
<i>Yes, chef?
Please don't get too excited.</i>

04:40.987 --> 04:42.488
You will not be
butchering these animals.

04:42.489 --> 04:45.090
No, I'm excited
to "rassle" 'em.

04:45.091 --> 04:46.692
<i> Wrestle?</i>

04:47.894 --> 04:50.562
What's wrong, Nedra?

04:50.563 --> 04:51.697
I am scared.

04:51.698 --> 04:53.799
I'm scared of animals, okay?

04:55.001 --> 04:56.535
Turkeys and.

04:56.536 --> 04:57.569
Come on.

04:57.570 --> 04:59.404
I'm scared of my own damn dog.

04:59.405 --> 05:00.739
That should
tell y'all something.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.907
Turkeys are pretty mean,
aren't they?

05:01.908 --> 05:02.908
Well, you're about to find out.

05:05.678 --> 05:06.912
Okay, listen carefully.

05:06.913 --> 05:08.847
Here's how the challenge
is going to work.

05:08.848 --> 05:11.216
One member from each team
will enter the pen

05:11.217 --> 05:13.352
and herd an animal

05:13.353 --> 05:15.020
into one of these cages.

05:15.021 --> 05:16.922
<i>Whatever animal</i>

05:16.923 --> 05:18.290
you place in that cage,

05:18.291 --> 05:21.260
that is the protein
you're working with.

05:21.261 --> 05:23.662
The name of the starch
on top of the cage

05:23.663 --> 05:25.264
<i>is a starch.</i>

05:25.265 --> 05:26.665
<i>Right? Yes, chef.</i>

05:26.666 --> 05:28.867
<i>All of you will
have a maximum</i>

05:28.868 --> 05:30.202
<i>of ten minutes.</i>

05:30.203 --> 05:31.403
Man, this is gonna be
easy for me.

05:31.404 --> 05:32.571
I've spent some time on a farm.

05:32.572 --> 05:33.906
Let's go.

05:33.907 --> 05:35.140
I know how to deal
with these animals.

05:35.141 --> 05:36.141
This is gonna be fun.

05:36.142 --> 05:37.376
<i> Okay, right.</i>

05:37.377 --> 05:39.111
Red team, blue team,
are you ready?

05:39.112 --> 05:40.312
Yes, chef.

05:40.313 --> 05:41.380
On your mark...

05:41.381 --> 05:43.315
Get set... Let's go!

05:43.316 --> 05:44.716
For the farm fresh challenge,

05:44.717 --> 05:46.285
the teams will have ten minutes

05:46.286 --> 05:47.719
to herd animals into cages.

05:47.720 --> 05:48.787
Get in there.
In there, in there!

05:48.788 --> 05:49.922
Oh, you were so close!

05:49.923 --> 05:51.723
The animal each chef chooses

05:51.724 --> 05:53.625
will determine the protein
they will be working with.

05:53.626 --> 05:55.394
Nice, Dan!
Nice job!

05:55.395 --> 05:58.363
And the label on the
cage will determine the starch.

05:58.364 --> 05:59.965
<i> Go, go, go, go!</i>

05:59.966 --> 06:01.300
<i>Well done.</i>

06:01.301 --> 06:02.301
<i>Get ready, get ready,
get ready, get ready.</i>

06:02.302 --> 06:03.535
Good, good, good, good.

06:03.536 --> 06:05.304
<i>Nedra, let's go.</i>

06:05.305 --> 06:06.672
I'm still scared
of them,

06:06.673 --> 06:08.273
but I'm gonna do it.

06:08.274 --> 06:09.308
Go, Nedra!

06:09.309 --> 06:10.909
<i> Let's go.</i>

06:10.910 --> 06:12.878
<i>Whoo!
Open up the gate.</i>

06:17.784 --> 06:20.586
At this point, the animals
are actually chasing Nedra.

06:24.023 --> 06:25.657
It's comedy,
but at the same time,

06:25.658 --> 06:28.493
the guys are running
in and out, no problem.

06:28.494 --> 06:29.761
What if we don't get to cook?

06:29.762 --> 06:31.230
Aah!

06:31.231 --> 06:32.497
Nedra,
we're running out of time!

06:32.498 --> 06:35.100
Come on, Nedra,
you're killing us!

06:35.101 --> 06:37.169
With Nedra paralyzed by fear...

06:38.204 --> 06:39.638
The blue team charges...

06:41.140 --> 06:43.108
Wrestles...
Oh, my God!

06:43.109 --> 06:44.810
Get in, get in,
get in, get in, get in.

06:44.811 --> 06:46.411
And manhandles...

06:46.412 --> 06:48.647
<i>Ohh!</i>

06:48.648 --> 06:49.882
Yeah, Ray.

06:49.883 --> 06:51.416
Their way
across the finish line.

06:51.417 --> 06:52.985
<i> Blue team, well done.</i>

06:52.986 --> 06:53.986
Meanwhile...

06:53.987 --> 06:55.487
Ooh!.

06:55.488 --> 06:56.722
Now!
Nedra!

06:56.723 --> 06:58.223
Stop calling my name!

06:58.224 --> 07:00.525
<i>Got it, babe,
herd it, herd it, herd it!</i>

07:00.526 --> 07:03.195
<i>Herd it, herd it!
Yeah, there you go!</i>

07:03.196 --> 07:04.396
<i>There you go!</i>

07:04.397 --> 07:05.998
Good job, Nedra!

07:05.999 --> 07:07.332
Two minutes to go.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.134
And now, with
time running down...

07:09.135 --> 07:10.569
<i>Good job, Amanda!
Good job!</i>

07:10.570 --> 07:12.838
The women race to ensure

07:12.839 --> 07:14.706
that each of them
has a protein to cook.

07:14.707 --> 07:16.408
Mary had a little lamb!

07:19.379 --> 07:21.213
<i>40 seconds.
Right there!</i>

07:21.214 --> 07:22.781
<i>Good job!</i>

07:22.782 --> 07:23.782
<i>All right!</i>

07:25.118 --> 07:26.618
Well done.

07:26.619 --> 07:29.187
With their proteins
and starches determined,

07:29.188 --> 07:31.056
the chefs quickly gather
for the cooking portion

07:31.057 --> 07:32.391
of the challenge.

07:32.392 --> 07:33.659
Let's go!

07:33.660 --> 07:35.160
You know your protein.
You know your starch.

07:35.161 --> 07:36.595
You've got 40 minutes
to come up

07:36.596 --> 07:38.096
with a stunning dish.

07:38.097 --> 07:40.766
Your time starts now!
Good luck.

07:40.767 --> 07:41.800
Where's the goat?
Where's the goat?

07:41.801 --> 07:44.303
Goat, goat.
Catch. Catch. Catch.

07:44.304 --> 07:45.637
<i>Hell, yeah, let's do it!</i>

07:45.638 --> 07:46.838
<i>Ned, what you got, girl?</i>

07:46.839 --> 07:49.174
I got turkey
and sweet potatoes.

07:49.175 --> 07:50.642
I'm taking it back home.

07:50.643 --> 07:51.843
There you go.

07:51.844 --> 07:53.145
This is something
that my mama do.

07:53.146 --> 07:55.814
Braised turkey legs,
sweet potato, collard greens.

07:55.815 --> 07:58.517
I gotta pull this off,
so my mama don't kick my ass

07:58.518 --> 07:59.918
on this challenge, okay?

07:59.919 --> 08:01.353
Right behind you, hot.
Right behind you.

08:01.354 --> 08:03.055
<i>Let's go, Ray.
Yes, chef.</i>

08:03.056 --> 08:06.525
I'm doing, uh, two different
types of turkey meatballs.

08:06.526 --> 08:08.126
My friends love my meatballs.

08:08.127 --> 08:09.494
I should open up
a meatball factory.

08:09.495 --> 08:12.230
You know, I mean, I'm pretty
proud of my meatballs.

08:12.231 --> 08:16.034
So I'm excited
to make meatballs.

08:16.035 --> 08:17.970
Chicken stock, anybody?

08:17.971 --> 08:19.237
Try and pull off

08:19.238 --> 08:20.939
a potato gratin
right now.

08:20.940 --> 08:22.074
If you have enough time.

08:22.075 --> 08:23.709
Cut my potatoes really thin,

08:23.710 --> 08:25.344
so they cook really fast.
Yeah, cook fast.

08:25.345 --> 08:26.878
Just coming up to halfway.

08:26.879 --> 08:28.013
How much time?

08:28.014 --> 08:29.047
About 23.

08:29.048 --> 08:30.048
23 minutes?

08:30.049 --> 08:31.817
Yes.
What?

08:31.818 --> 08:33.184
I have goat ribs right now.

08:33.186 --> 08:35.020
I'm gonna char it on the grill.

08:35.020 --> 08:37.956
I've couscous going
on top of the oven.

08:37.957 --> 08:40.258
I've never cooked goat
before in my life.

08:40.259 --> 08:41.927
I figure if anybody on the team

08:41.928 --> 08:44.730
has a shot at doing it
fairly well, it's me.

08:44.731 --> 08:46.865
Keep in mind that
that yam is sweet.

08:46.866 --> 08:48.767
Might want to think
about doing glaze.

08:48.768 --> 08:50.202
So now I'm
checking everybody's food.

08:50.203 --> 08:52.137
Finish it with some nice,
dry herbs, yeah?

08:52.138 --> 08:53.638
Oh, I got it, homes.
I got it.

08:53.639 --> 08:55.807
I have to make sure
every dish is perfect.

08:55.808 --> 08:58.143
How do you feel about,
like, going classic, right?

08:58.144 --> 09:00.078
<i>Lamb and minted potatoes.</i>

09:00.079 --> 09:01.813
Classic flavor pairing.

09:01.814 --> 09:04.116
Why is this guy trying
to coach me on how to cook?

09:04.117 --> 09:05.784
Parsnip puree
might go really well

09:05.785 --> 09:07.819
with that lamb
'cause of the sweetness.

09:07.820 --> 09:09.521
Does this guy know
who the I am?

09:09.522 --> 09:10.989
Chef Zach.
Puree?

09:10.990 --> 09:12.224
Let's do it.
Something like that.

09:12.225 --> 09:13.592
I don't need suggestions.

09:13.593 --> 09:15.494
Roasted mint potatoes.
I'll make it happen.

09:15.495 --> 09:16.962
Yep.

09:16.963 --> 09:18.964
Last five minutes, guys.
Make it count.

09:18.965 --> 09:20.966
<i>It's coming up soon. Behind you.
Hot pan coming through.</i>

09:20.967 --> 09:23.668
Behind, behind, behind, behind.
Oven open!

09:23.669 --> 09:26.471
Ohh, are you kidding me
right now?

09:26.472 --> 09:28.540
Oh, my God.
I pulled it off.

09:28.541 --> 09:30.008
<i>Good job, girl.
Good job.</i>

09:30.009 --> 09:32.177
20 seconds to go!
Come on!

09:32.178 --> 09:33.779
I got my plate.
I'm ready to plate.

09:33.780 --> 09:34.980
On the plate,
on the plate, on the plate.

09:34.981 --> 09:35.981
<i>All right, ladies.
We're getting close.</i>

09:35.982 --> 09:37.149
Seven! Six!

09:37.150 --> 09:38.784
<i>Ladies, can I help you
with anything?</i>

09:38.785 --> 09:39.785
<i>I'm done plating.
Watch out, watch out, watch out.</i>

09:39.786 --> 09:41.019
<i>Three...
Whoo!</i>

09:41.020 --> 09:42.421
<i>Two...One...
Sorry.</i>

09:42.422 --> 09:43.555
And stop!

09:43.556 --> 09:45.190
<i>Good job, ladies.
Good job, ladies.</i>

09:45.191 --> 09:46.625
Okay, listen carefully.

09:46.626 --> 09:49.795
You may have cooked
seven dishes,

09:49.796 --> 09:53.698
but I'm only judging five,
one of each protein.

09:53.699 --> 09:55.834
As a team, decide whose dishes

09:55.835 --> 09:56.968
<i>you want to drop.</i>

09:56.969 --> 09:58.670
After a quick discussion,

09:58.671 --> 10:01.873
the women eliminate
Cyndi and Jacqueline's dishes.

10:01.874 --> 10:03.708
Happy with what you dropped?

10:03.709 --> 10:04.709
Yes, chef.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.445
I want our team to win,

10:06.446 --> 10:09.381
and if that means
me and Jackie has to sit out,

10:09.382 --> 10:10.382
you know, that's fine.

10:10.383 --> 10:11.516
Right, gents.

10:11.517 --> 10:12.717
On the blue team...

10:12.718 --> 10:14.586
My a little bit over.

10:14.587 --> 10:16.521
Jon takes
himself out of the running.

10:16.522 --> 10:17.722
Whose duck are you dropping?

10:17.723 --> 10:19.091
<i>Jon's, chef.
Pass it down.</i>

10:19.092 --> 10:20.859
And now they must decide

10:20.860 --> 10:22.160
whether to serve Dan...

10:22.161 --> 10:23.161
I'm confident in mine.

10:23.162 --> 10:24.229
<i>I don't know, Dan.</i>

10:24.230 --> 10:25.564
Or Michael's goat.

10:25.565 --> 10:27.265
I wanna go with Michael's.
Yeah.

10:27.266 --> 10:29.167
Right, whose goat
are you dropping?

10:29.168 --> 10:30.635
I guess
we're dropping mine, chef.

10:30.636 --> 10:32.070
Apparently, Michael has
some kind of "cooking skill,"

10:32.071 --> 10:33.105
and I don't.

10:33.106 --> 10:34.206
Line up in front
of your dishes.

10:34.207 --> 10:37.375
Let's go.

10:37.376 --> 10:38.577
Red team, blue team,

10:38.578 --> 10:39.878
your proteins
will go head-to-head.

10:39.879 --> 10:43.181
But I am not gonna be
judging this alone.

10:43.182 --> 10:46.518
I have invited a very
special guest this morning.

10:46.519 --> 10:48.220
<i>Food & Wine Magazine</i>

10:48.221 --> 10:51.923
recently voted him
best new chef in the country.

10:51.924 --> 10:53.358
Wow.

10:53.359 --> 10:55.927
He is the cofounder and owner

10:55.928 --> 10:58.697
<i>of one of L.A.'s
hottest restaurants,</i>

10:58.698 --> 10:59.931
Animal.

10:59.932 --> 11:01.500
<i>Please give a warm welcome</i>

11:01.501 --> 11:03.468
to Jon Shook.

11:04.570 --> 11:05.971
Chef, good to see you.

11:05.972 --> 11:08.006
I definitely respect
chef Shook,

11:08.007 --> 11:09.508
and I've been trying
to go to Animal

11:09.509 --> 11:11.109
for a long time.

11:11.110 --> 11:13.411
I'm excited.
It's a huge honor.

11:14.747 --> 11:17.382
I appreciate you giving up
your busy day to be here.

11:17.383 --> 11:19.551
<i>Yeah, I'm excited
to eat some animals.</i>

11:19.552 --> 11:20.552
Good.
Good, good, good.

11:20.553 --> 11:22.154
We're gonna start off with...

11:22.155 --> 11:23.188
The battle of the turkey.

11:23.189 --> 11:24.623
Let's go.
Let's go.

11:24.624 --> 11:26.391
First up,
it's Nedra versus Ray.

11:26.392 --> 11:28.059
Okay.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.761
Nedra, let's go first, please.

11:29.762 --> 11:31.263
Um, I just was
taking it back home...

11:31.264 --> 11:34.166
Turkey legs and sweet potatoes
with some sweet potato strings.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.433
Just left the whole thing...

11:35.434 --> 11:37.135
<i>looks like something
from Captain Caveman.</i>

11:37.136 --> 11:38.370
Would you not take
the meat off the bone or...

11:38.371 --> 11:40.572
I was trying to keep it rustic!

11:40.573 --> 11:42.707
You talkin' about it
look like Captain Caveman.

11:42.708 --> 11:44.442
Let's just see
how it's gonna taste

11:44.443 --> 11:46.778
compared to old man Ray.

11:48.714 --> 11:50.182
<i>You definitely have
plenty of salt on this,</i>

11:50.183 --> 11:51.183
<i>which is good.</i>

11:51.184 --> 11:52.684
To me, I think the turkey legs

11:52.685 --> 11:55.420
could have been cooked
a little bit longer.

11:55.421 --> 11:56.488
Yeah. And also,
I like the heat.

11:56.489 --> 11:58.023
But needs a touch more cooking.

11:58.024 --> 11:59.624
<i>Yes.
Thank you. Ray.</i>

11:59.625 --> 12:01.693
I made two types
of turkey meatballs.

12:01.694 --> 12:02.994
Ray, you got a lot
of balls, literally.

12:02.995 --> 12:04.696
Um...

12:06.365 --> 12:07.365
Just a little dry for me.

12:07.366 --> 12:08.366
<i>Yeah.
Okay.</i>

12:08.367 --> 12:09.701
It needs sauce, Ray.

12:09.702 --> 12:10.769
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

12:10.770 --> 12:12.771
Uh, Jon, if you
had to choose one...

12:12.772 --> 12:13.805
<i>Just personally,</i>

12:13.806 --> 12:15.307
I would go with the red team.

12:15.308 --> 12:16.675
Whoo!

12:16.676 --> 12:18.777
That dish represent my mom.

12:18.778 --> 12:20.011
How awesome is that?

12:20.012 --> 12:22.380
I just said, "I'm gonna
go with what I know,"

12:22.381 --> 12:24.382
and I went
with what I knew, okay?

12:24.383 --> 12:25.450
Thank you, chef.

12:25.451 --> 12:26.618
With Nedra's turkey

12:26.619 --> 12:28.186
giving the red team
an early leg up...

12:28.187 --> 12:30.522
Okay, uh, battle of the duck.
Let's go.

12:30.523 --> 12:32.591
It's now time
for Susan's duck breast

12:32.592 --> 12:33.592
with citrus quinoa...

12:33.593 --> 12:34.726
It's a pretty basic dish,

12:34.727 --> 12:35.727
but it's actually pretty tasty.

12:35.728 --> 12:37.095
To go head-to-head

12:37.096 --> 12:39.798
against Anthony's seared duck
with jasmine rice.

12:39.799 --> 12:40.932
Your duck's cooked good

12:40.933 --> 12:42.701
once again,
which is good to see.

12:42.702 --> 12:45.103
But the crispy duck
on the inside

12:45.104 --> 12:46.471
is almost too crispy.

12:46.472 --> 12:47.772
It sticks...
it's sticking in my teeth.

12:47.773 --> 12:48.773
I think for this one too, chef,

12:48.774 --> 12:49.941
I'd have to pick the red team.

12:49.942 --> 12:50.942
Red team. Wow.

12:50.943 --> 12:51.943
Thank you.
Thank you, chef.

12:51.944 --> 12:53.912
<i>Good job.
Way to go.</i>

12:53.913 --> 12:55.480
With the red
team adding to their lead...

12:55.481 --> 12:57.816
Okay, next up.
Um, lamb. Let's go.

12:57.817 --> 12:59.784
Zach is hoping
to get the men on the board

12:59.785 --> 13:02.220
with his lamb
and roasted potatoes.

13:02.221 --> 13:03.355
I do enjoy your dish a lot.

13:03.356 --> 13:04.489
Good. The greens
worked beautifully.

13:04.490 --> 13:06.124
Yeah.
Mary, please.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.994
As for Mary's
pecan-crusted lamb with couscous...

13:08.995 --> 13:10.262
<i>I mean, it's raw.</i>

13:10.263 --> 13:11.563
I don't want
to kill chef Ramsay.

13:11.564 --> 13:13.131
I don't want
to kill him either.

13:13.132 --> 13:15.400
It doesn't
even stand a chance.

13:15.401 --> 13:16.501
This one, I would have
to go with the blue team.

13:16.502 --> 13:17.769
Okay.
Thanks, chef.

13:17.770 --> 13:19.604
Thank you.
Sorry about that, chef.

13:19.605 --> 13:21.539
Mary, Mary, quite contrary.

13:21.540 --> 13:22.540
Good job, Zach.

13:23.876 --> 13:25.377
Get it together, woman!

13:25.378 --> 13:27.045
<i>Uh, ladies,</i>

13:27.046 --> 13:28.346
you're still in the lead,
two to one.

13:28.347 --> 13:30.015
<i>Amanda and Barret, let's go.</i>

13:30.016 --> 13:32.017
Come on, Amanda.

13:32.018 --> 13:35.920
Today, I prepared
a seared pork,

13:35.921 --> 13:37.689
uh, with an onion ragu

13:37.690 --> 13:39.024
and a cheesy gratin.

13:39.025 --> 13:41.660
It's such a relief to know
that my potatoes

13:41.661 --> 13:43.028
came through for me.

13:43.029 --> 13:45.063
It was like, "Whew."

13:46.799 --> 13:48.667
Where your teammate
undercooked,

13:48.668 --> 13:51.770
you overcooked yours.

13:51.771 --> 13:54.306
Let's have a look.
That's dry.

13:54.307 --> 13:55.540
My first con... concern

13:55.541 --> 13:57.409
was getting the potatoes in

13:57.410 --> 13:58.810
<i>'cause I knew that they
were gonna take the longest.</i>

13:58.811 --> 14:00.812
The hero was the protein, right?
Yes, chef.

14:00.813 --> 14:03.581
Hopefully your potatoes
will outshine his pork dish.

14:03.582 --> 14:05.250
<i>Barret, please explain to Jon</i>

14:05.251 --> 14:06.284
exactly what we've got here.

14:06.285 --> 14:07.419
What I have here

14:07.420 --> 14:10.288
<i>is a pan-seared pork.</i>

14:13.025 --> 14:15.694
Wow, glistening
and absolutely beautiful.

14:15.695 --> 14:17.062
Great job.

14:18.297 --> 14:19.397
I'm a beast!

14:19.398 --> 14:21.199
I mean, just that alone,

14:21.200 --> 14:23.034
I don't even have to pick
who won, I don't think.

14:23.035 --> 14:24.135
<i>I mean, the blue team,
definitely.</i>

14:24.136 --> 14:25.637
Good job.
Really good job.

14:25.638 --> 14:28.640
No way, Barret.
Congratulations.

14:28.641 --> 14:29.908
We got this one.

14:31.243 --> 14:32.277
Okay.

14:32.278 --> 14:33.478
<i>Ladies, gents...</i>

14:33.479 --> 14:35.747
It's 2-2.
Time for the goat, please.

14:35.748 --> 14:37.182
With the score tied,

14:37.183 --> 14:39.751
it all comes down
to Ja'nel and Michael.

14:39.752 --> 14:41.286
Uh, Ja'nel, please.

14:41.287 --> 14:44.122
Today, I prepared for you

14:44.123 --> 14:46.825
<i>a goat and wild
mushroom ragu.</i>

14:48.894 --> 14:50.795
You know, your dish
is actually really tasty.

14:50.796 --> 14:52.297
<i>How can that be so tender</i>

14:52.298 --> 14:53.598
and literally melt
in your mouth?

14:53.599 --> 14:55.333
It's almost like softer
than the polenta. Yeah.

14:55.334 --> 14:56.601
Yeah!

14:56.602 --> 14:58.303
Ja'nel's goat is tender.

14:58.304 --> 14:59.404
It's cooked perfectly.

14:59.405 --> 15:00.638
We should get the point.

15:00.639 --> 15:01.706
You've nailed that.

15:01.707 --> 15:02.707
Thank you, chef.

15:02.708 --> 15:03.775
I agree.
Michael...

15:03.776 --> 15:05.477
Right now, Michael needs to be

15:05.478 --> 15:07.178
the chef that he says he is.

15:07.179 --> 15:08.413
He needs to bring this home
for us

15:08.414 --> 15:09.447
and get us this point.

15:09.448 --> 15:12.984
Please present your dish
to Jon.

15:12.985 --> 15:14.986
Okay, um...

15:17.812 --> 15:20.679
The score is tied
in the farm fresh challenge,

15:20.680 --> 15:23.148
and the blue team
is counting on Michael's goat

15:23.149 --> 15:24.850
to bring home the victory.

15:24.851 --> 15:26.017
<i>Michael, please.</i>

15:26.018 --> 15:27.285
Okay.

15:27.286 --> 15:29.621
Michael, they chose yours
over mine.

15:29.622 --> 15:30.989
I don't think I have
to say this,

15:30.990 --> 15:32.657
but please don't mess this up.

15:32.658 --> 15:34.559
Essentially, I took
a little bit of a risk

15:34.560 --> 15:35.761
because it is the rib,

15:35.762 --> 15:37.295
and I know it requires
a long cooking time.

15:37.296 --> 15:38.764
<i>Underneath,
I have the couscous.</i>

15:38.765 --> 15:39.798
A lot of fresh herbs.

15:39.799 --> 15:40.999
The nose on it's great.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.033
I... from here.

15:42.034 --> 15:43.101
You know,
at the end of the day,

15:43.102 --> 15:44.202
it's gonna be the rib, I think.

15:44.203 --> 15:46.138
<i>Right.
Cooking ribs in 45 minutes</i>

15:46.139 --> 15:47.672
and not even having
a pressure cooker,

15:47.673 --> 15:48.907
I mean, that's a risk.

15:48.908 --> 15:51.476
<i>Right.</i>

15:56.282 --> 15:58.083
This is like something
that I would feed my dog...

15:58.084 --> 15:59.184
Ohh!.

15:59.185 --> 16:00.218
<i>In the backyard, just...</i>

16:00.219 --> 16:01.219
<i>It's so tough.</i>

16:01.220 --> 16:02.721
Oh, God.

16:02.722 --> 16:04.289
<i>No.</i>

16:04.290 --> 16:05.524
No, no, no, no...
I can't afford

16:05.525 --> 16:07.058
a week in the dentist.
No.

16:07.059 --> 16:08.360
Chef Mike!

16:08.361 --> 16:09.928
You should have took
some of your own suggestions.

16:09.929 --> 16:11.363
Maybe you know
how to cook better,

16:11.364 --> 16:12.764
and, uh, this
won't be happening.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.332
You've got
all this froufrou going on.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.001
And the hero is a zero.

16:16.002 --> 16:17.836
<i>I mean, it's pretty much
the red team.</i>

16:17.837 --> 16:19.604
I mean, there's
no other way around that.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.807
Wow, red team, congratulations.

16:21.808 --> 16:23.141
<i>Great job.
Thank you!</i>

16:24.510 --> 16:26.311
Whoo! We win!

16:26.312 --> 16:27.712
Good job, Ja'nel. Awesome.
Good job, baby.

16:27.713 --> 16:29.447
We took that loss yesterday.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.116
We didn't let it slow us down.

16:31.117 --> 16:33.852
And today, we come back
with a victory.

16:33.853 --> 16:35.253
I'm super pumped.

16:35.254 --> 16:36.922
Ladies, great job.
Uh, Ja'nel,

16:36.923 --> 16:39.157
I mean, that was a very
strong finish. Yeah.

16:39.158 --> 16:40.258
Thank you, chef.
Thank you.

16:40.259 --> 16:41.593
Probably, I think,
the best dish so far

16:41.594 --> 16:42.928
<i>out of all of them
was Ja'nel's.</i>

16:42.929 --> 16:44.196
<i> Amazing.</i>

16:44.197 --> 16:45.330
<i>Yeah, best dish!
Amazing, amazing.</i>

16:45.331 --> 16:47.432
Um, Dan, did you make
a goat dish?

16:47.433 --> 16:49.367
Yes, chef.
Can we just taste it?

16:49.368 --> 16:51.937
<i>Just for argument's sake?</i>

16:53.773 --> 16:55.640
<i>I have a rough-cut goat
right there, chef,</i>

16:55.641 --> 16:59.411
with a roasted red pepper,
uh, risotto cake.

16:59.412 --> 17:00.579
Mmm.

17:00.580 --> 17:01.980
I would have picked
this dish over the ribs.

17:01.981 --> 17:03.348
<i>I mean, that's delicious.
.</i>

17:03.349 --> 17:04.516
Next time, maybe
talk your teammates

17:04.517 --> 17:07.152
into choosing your dish
over, uh, the other dish.

17:07.153 --> 17:08.486
you guys,

17:08.487 --> 17:09.855
all of you.

17:09.856 --> 17:11.990
My dish should have been
up there, according to chef,

17:11.991 --> 17:13.425
and y'all still have no faith.

17:13.425 --> 17:15.926
That's fine.
Underestimate me.

17:15.928 --> 17:17.395
I'd like you to join me
in saying a big thank-you

17:17.396 --> 17:18.696
<i>to this amazing chef.</i>

17:18.698 --> 17:20.232
<i>Jon Shook. Please.
Thank you so much, chef!</i>

17:20.233 --> 17:22.166
Thank you guys for having me.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.300
<i>Congratulations on the
restaurant. Thanks.</i>

17:23.301 --> 17:25.604
Thank you, Jon.

17:25.605 --> 17:26.738
<i>Ladies, one loss,</i>

17:26.739 --> 17:28.138
and you come back fighting.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.441
Fighting hard.
Fighting hard.

17:29.442 --> 17:31.476
We have a real treat
for you today.

17:31.477 --> 17:34.379
All of you are going
to become V.I.P. guests

17:34.380 --> 17:37.082
at the Aquarium of the Pacific.

17:40.553 --> 17:42.020
I love fish.

17:42.021 --> 17:43.622
You get a chance
to feed penguins...

17:43.623 --> 17:44.623
Penguins!

17:44.624 --> 17:46.524
And swim with the fishes.

17:48.861 --> 17:51.930
A trip to the aquarium
in Long Beach.

17:51.931 --> 17:53.031
V.I.P. treatment.

17:53.032 --> 17:55.367
Snorkeling with sea animals.

17:55.368 --> 17:57.535
God, that would be so nice.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.571
Ladies, go and get ready,

17:59.572 --> 18:00.705
because your limos are waiting.

18:00.706 --> 18:01.840
<i>Let's go.</i>

18:01.841 --> 18:03.208
<i>Go, go, go.
Thank you, chef.</i>

18:03.209 --> 18:04.342
Sorry, guys.

18:04.343 --> 18:05.510
<i>Blue team,</i>

18:05.511 --> 18:06.811
tomorrow night

18:06.812 --> 18:08.813
<i>is a unique night
in Hell's Kitchen</i>

18:08.814 --> 18:11.683
because it's family night.

18:11.684 --> 18:12.951
For tomorrow's festivities,

18:12.952 --> 18:15.553
<i>all of you have got
this miserable task</i>

18:15.554 --> 18:16.755
<i>of putting together</i>

18:16.756 --> 18:19.491
a petting zoo.

18:20.493 --> 18:21.493
Those animals,

18:21.494 --> 18:23.028
<i>you have to make sure</i>

18:23.029 --> 18:24.362
<i>that their stay
in Hell's Kitchen</i>

18:24.363 --> 18:26.598
is as comfortable as can be.

18:26.599 --> 18:27.699
Oh, my God.

18:27.700 --> 18:28.700
<i> Cleaning them up,</i>

18:28.701 --> 18:30.168
<i>taking care of them,</i>

18:30.169 --> 18:31.303
and cooking for them.

18:31.304 --> 18:33.071
Cooking for them?

18:33.072 --> 18:34.439
Out you go.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.441
I couldn't even
contribute to my team today,

18:36.442 --> 18:37.842
so don't blame
this on me.

18:37.843 --> 18:39.945
The blue team
looks like jackasses.

18:39.946 --> 18:41.179
How fitting.

18:44.016 --> 18:45.951
I'm a city boy.
I'm from Philadelphia.

18:45.952 --> 18:47.852
And now, here I am, chef Zach,

18:47.853 --> 18:50.155
a.k.a.
Farmer in the Dell.

18:50.156 --> 18:51.556
Where to take 'em?
Where am I taking 'em?

18:51.557 --> 18:54.059
Where am I taking 'em?
Hi-ho the merry-o.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.728
The farmer in the Dell.

18:58.264 --> 18:59.731
There you go.

18:59.732 --> 19:02.067
While the men
wallow with the pigs...

19:02.068 --> 19:03.568
Aww...
The women head out

19:03.569 --> 19:05.670
for a day at the aquarium.

19:05.671 --> 19:07.472
<i> Welcome
to the Aquarium of the Pacific</i>

19:07.473 --> 19:08.907
<i>in Long Beach, California.</i>

19:08.908 --> 19:11.476
Whoo!

19:13.779 --> 19:15.780
<i> Here
at the Aquarium of the Pacific,</i>

19:15.781 --> 19:17.349
we have
our seafood for the future

19:17.350 --> 19:18.950
<i>seafood advisory program.</i>

19:18.951 --> 19:20.452
<i>One of the ways
that you, as chefs,</i>

19:20.453 --> 19:23.221
<i>can actually help
these penguins</i>

19:23.222 --> 19:24.489
is by sourcing
responsible seafood

19:24.490 --> 19:26.658
in your restaurants.

19:26.659 --> 19:28.626
Aww.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.228
<i>That's awesome.</i>

19:30.229 --> 19:35.033
I am scared
to feed these penguins.

19:35.034 --> 19:38.169
One of them sons of bitches
gonna bite my finger off.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.574
<i>We need 28 servings</i>

19:42.575 --> 19:44.275
of ratatouille.

19:44.276 --> 19:45.510
Look at this.

19:45.511 --> 19:48.046
They have menus
for these animals.

19:48.047 --> 19:49.547
The animals eat better than us.

19:49.548 --> 19:51.149
This is where
your breaking point starts.

19:51.150 --> 19:52.851
I passed mine.

19:52.852 --> 19:53.885
<i>If you guys would have
picked my dish,</i>

19:53.886 --> 19:54.886
we would have been fine.

19:54.887 --> 19:56.321
<i>Wow.</i>

19:56.322 --> 19:58.223
If we would have used my dish,

19:58.224 --> 19:59.491
<i>we would have won.</i>

19:59.492 --> 20:00.492
No, we wouldn't have.

20:00.493 --> 20:01.526
All right.

20:01.527 --> 20:03.528
I do have some talent.

20:03.529 --> 20:04.996
I don't care if you don't
like me as a person.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.698
I'm tired of punishment.

20:06.699 --> 20:08.600
Get in there.
Put it right on the ground.

20:08.601 --> 20:10.402
They're definitely hungry.

20:10.403 --> 20:11.436
Come on, look.
It's okay.

20:11.437 --> 20:12.871
Really, I promise.

20:12.872 --> 20:15.340
Eat it. Eat.

20:15.341 --> 20:17.042
Guys, they're pigs.
They eat everything.

20:17.043 --> 20:18.410
<i>The fact that they're
not eating your ratatouille</i>

20:18.411 --> 20:19.911
<i>should say something.</i>

20:19.912 --> 20:22.113
While the men
serve their animals lunch...

20:22.114 --> 20:23.982
Eat the food!

20:23.983 --> 20:25.784
The women...

20:25.785 --> 20:28.353
Remember, chef,
we go for the legs first.

20:28.354 --> 20:30.321
Are afraid of being lunch.

20:30.322 --> 20:32.090
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

20:33.292 --> 20:35.927
This is an opportunity
that I never imagined

20:35.928 --> 20:38.763
that I would have,
and it's just another experience

20:38.764 --> 20:40.432
to unite the red team.

20:40.433 --> 20:41.566
And we are once again

20:41.567 --> 20:43.134
back on our winning streak.

20:47.306 --> 20:48.706
Come on.

20:48.707 --> 20:50.608
<i> Dan, I think you
found your calling.</i>

20:50.609 --> 20:52.510
Come on, dude.

20:52.511 --> 20:54.479
Let's go laugh at them.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.014
<i>Ah ha ha! Yeah.</i>

20:56.015 --> 20:57.849
Wanna go this way now?

20:57.850 --> 20:59.184
The only time blue team's
working as a team

20:59.185 --> 21:01.186
it has been, "who are we
gonna gang up on now?"

21:01.187 --> 21:02.720
I didn't come here
for this.

21:02.721 --> 21:05.356
I came here to cook.
I came here to learn.

21:05.357 --> 21:07.559
I'm done walking this.
It's not going anywhere.

21:07.560 --> 21:08.626
It's just standing there.

21:08.627 --> 21:09.894
Okay, why are you
handing it to me?

21:09.895 --> 21:11.362
Why don't you hand it
to one of your teammates?

21:11.363 --> 21:12.697
I need a time-out
for a second.

21:12.698 --> 21:14.199
I'm about to lose my mind.
Really?

21:14.200 --> 21:15.600
<i>Wow!
Uh-oh.</i>

21:15.601 --> 21:16.835
Dan.
He's a little bitch.

21:16.836 --> 21:18.203
He whines about everything.

21:18.204 --> 21:19.270
Like, what the 's
the matter with you, dude?

21:19.271 --> 21:20.438
He's such a little bitch.

21:20.439 --> 21:21.606
Shut the up!

21:21.607 --> 21:22.874
Maybe he's just hungry.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.342
Dan, there's
some mashed potatoes

21:24.343 --> 21:25.577
with chives and parsley.

21:25.578 --> 21:26.578
<i>They didn't eat it.</i>

21:27.580 --> 21:28.880
I'm done with you guys.

21:28.881 --> 21:30.949
You and
your mother!

21:30.950 --> 21:33.651
<i>This is the most fun
I've had since we've been here.</i>

21:33.652 --> 21:35.019
I'm done!

21:35.020 --> 21:38.156
Shut up, bitch!

21:44.568 --> 21:47.270
After a punishing day
cleaning up after farm animals...

21:47.271 --> 21:49.039
Dan, there's
some mashed potatoes

21:49.040 --> 21:50.173
with chives and parsley.

21:50.174 --> 21:51.274
One member of the blue team

21:51.275 --> 21:53.143
is behaving like a lone wolf.

21:53.144 --> 21:54.411
<i>And some ratatouille.</i>

21:54.412 --> 21:56.446
Shut up, bitch!

21:56.447 --> 21:58.314
Blue team, I'm done
with you guys.

21:58.315 --> 22:00.083
From now on, I'm just
gonna let them fail.

22:00.084 --> 22:02.585
My strategy at the competition,
this point moving forward,

22:02.586 --> 22:04.654
is take care of myself.

22:07.892 --> 22:10.760
With a new
day comes more work,

22:10.761 --> 22:12.829
prepping for tonight's
family dinner service.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.030
Dan's gonna
kill us tonight.

22:14.031 --> 22:15.498
<i>Is he on Earth today?</i>

22:15.499 --> 22:16.933
And the blue team is trying

22:16.934 --> 22:18.234
to figure out what to do...

22:18.235 --> 22:19.869
Don't let it stay on the sides.

22:19.870 --> 22:21.337
With their problem child.

22:21.338 --> 22:23.907
As far as I'm concerned,
one bad service,

22:23.908 --> 22:26.176
and Dan's out of here.

22:26.177 --> 22:28.244
While Dan is
clearly the odd man out,

22:28.245 --> 22:29.546
the women...

22:29.547 --> 22:30.647
What else do we need?

22:30.648 --> 22:32.015
At least for the moment...

22:32.016 --> 22:33.583
It's nonstick?
Seem united.

22:33.584 --> 22:35.819
Guys, let's have
a really good dinner service.

22:35.820 --> 22:38.154
The red team is
really feeling good.

22:38.155 --> 22:39.622
We're all super focused.

22:39.623 --> 22:41.658
We'll be ready to rock
this dinner service out.

22:41.659 --> 22:43.760
<i>Ladies, honestly,
this is our service.</i>

22:43.761 --> 22:46.496
So we gonna win.

22:46.497 --> 22:47.697
Ladies, line up.
Let's go.

22:47.698 --> 22:52.168
Uh, gentlemen, let's go.

22:52.169 --> 22:54.704
Tonight, it's family night.
Big one, this one.

22:54.705 --> 22:56.973
<i>A very special,
unique evening.</i>

22:56.974 --> 22:59.809
Even my own children
are gonna be here.

22:59.810 --> 23:02.112
They'll be cooked
by the blue kitchen tonight.

23:02.113 --> 23:03.546
Chef Ramsay, really?

23:03.547 --> 23:05.648
You put your family
on the blue side?

23:05.649 --> 23:08.418
You know the red team
has its together.

23:08.419 --> 23:09.686
Don't let me down.

23:09.687 --> 23:11.421
More importantly,
don't let yourselves down.

23:11.422 --> 23:13.123
Yes, chef.

23:13.124 --> 23:14.524
Jean-Philippe, please,
open Hell's Kitchen

23:14.525 --> 23:16.526
for family night.
Thank you.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

23:30.107 --> 23:31.374
Oh, they're so cute.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.743
I expect tonight's service
to be smooth.

23:33.744 --> 23:35.378
Check your ovens.
Check your temperatures.

23:35.379 --> 23:37.313
Just got real again.

23:37.314 --> 23:40.150
It's family
night in Hell's Kitchen,

23:40.151 --> 23:41.351
and for tonight's
special event,

23:41.352 --> 23:43.586
in addition
to his classic menu,

23:43.587 --> 23:45.555
chef Ramsay has added
a kids' menu

23:45.556 --> 23:48.091
featuring margherita pizza,

23:48.092 --> 23:49.692
a cheeseburger and fries,

23:49.693 --> 23:51.661
and panko-crusted
chicken fingers.

23:51.662 --> 23:52.796
Uh, how are the children?

23:52.797 --> 23:54.130
<i>Oh, they're lovely.
Excellent.</i>

23:54.131 --> 23:55.532
Here we go, guys!

23:55.533 --> 23:56.900
First family in.

23:56.901 --> 23:59.402
One risotto, one scallops,
one pizza, one burger.

23:59.403 --> 24:00.403
Yes, chef!

24:00.404 --> 24:01.571
Let's go.

24:01.572 --> 24:02.806
Good timing in the kitchen

24:02.807 --> 24:04.174
is essential tonight

24:04.175 --> 24:05.875
as the children's meals
will be served

24:05.876 --> 24:08.278
alongside
their parents' appetizers

24:08.279 --> 24:11.581
to avoid a dining room
full of grumpy children.

24:11.582 --> 24:12.582
Time, please.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.150
How long
on that risotto?

24:14.151 --> 24:15.351
Uh, two minutes, tops.

24:15.352 --> 24:16.586
I'm going with scallops, then.

24:16.587 --> 24:18.288
<i>Two minutes on that pizza?
Yes.</i>

24:18.289 --> 24:20.290
I love pizza.
When I go grocery shopping,

24:20.291 --> 24:23.159
all I get is, like,
frozen pizzas and stuff.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.160
How long?

24:24.161 --> 24:25.161
I'm ready to walk on pizza.

24:25.162 --> 24:26.462
Scallops, 30 seconds.

24:26.463 --> 24:27.831
Cut that, please.

24:27.832 --> 24:29.666
Bring that risotto yet?
I'll take it.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.601
Here's the scallops
and the burger.

24:31.602 --> 24:33.603
Chef, behind you.
Pizza, risotto.

24:33.604 --> 24:35.505
It's burned.

24:35.506 --> 24:37.207
you all.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.675
. Come here, all of you!

24:38.676 --> 24:40.376
<i>Come on!</i>

24:40.377 --> 24:42.045
Hey, look,
there's no garnish around there.

24:42.046 --> 24:43.179
That's not the biggest bit.

24:43.180 --> 24:44.280
Look at that there.

24:44.281 --> 24:45.582
me.
For a kid.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.250
A kid.
A kid.

24:47.251 --> 24:50.286
Dan is like a monkey
wrench in the machine.

24:50.287 --> 24:51.754
Killin' me, man.

24:51.755 --> 24:53.590
Start again
and get it together!

24:53.591 --> 24:54.691
Yes, chef!

24:54.692 --> 24:55.859
Dan, slow down a second.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.694
think
what you're doing, please.

24:57.695 --> 25:00.964
Dan! You can't brush the oven
in front of the pizzas!

25:00.965 --> 25:01.965
<i>Yes, chef!
Oh, my God.</i>

25:01.966 --> 25:03.032
Guys!

25:03.033 --> 25:04.367
I should have known
it was coming.

25:04.368 --> 25:05.969
I mean, the kid's a little bit
of a train wreck.

25:05.970 --> 25:08.438
And if this kid can't
make a simple pizza,

25:08.439 --> 25:10.073
I need to step in
and pump 'em out.

25:10.074 --> 25:11.674
Let me do the pizza.

25:11.675 --> 25:13.076
Please let me do the pizza.
I got it.

25:13.077 --> 25:15.211
I know, but you don't.
He keeps yellin' at you.

25:15.212 --> 25:16.346
Can I brush it?
I just want to get your back.

25:16.347 --> 25:17.347
Thank you.
We're a team.

25:17.348 --> 25:18.681
I'm almost done brushing.

25:18.682 --> 25:20.383
If you want to get another two
ready, just in case.

25:20.384 --> 25:22.352
Or another one, sorry.
One.

25:22.353 --> 25:24.153
While the men
ready their refires...

25:24.154 --> 25:26.589
Chef, we're gonna get it
together right now.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.491
Back in the red kitchen...

25:28.492 --> 25:29.559
Risotto walking.

25:29.560 --> 25:30.693
Pizza.
Yes, chef!

25:30.694 --> 25:31.861
Chef, pizza.

25:31.862 --> 25:33.630
Chef Ramsay is waiting for...

25:33.631 --> 25:34.631
<i>Scallops!</i>

25:34.632 --> 25:36.065
Yes, 30 seconds.

25:36.066 --> 25:37.166
So their first orders

25:37.167 --> 25:38.468
can get out to the dining room.

25:38.469 --> 25:40.637
How can we be
so late with the scallops?

25:40.638 --> 25:41.638
Can somebody wake her up?

25:41.639 --> 25:42.705
Push it, push it, push it!

25:42.706 --> 25:43.706
<i>Jacqueline...
Yes, chef?</i>

25:43.707 --> 25:45.141
Come on, you!

25:45.142 --> 25:46.442
The easiest dish to cook.

25:46.443 --> 25:48.378
Right behind, right behind.

25:48.379 --> 25:49.379
Scallops, going up!

25:51.482 --> 25:53.650
They're rubber.

25:53.651 --> 25:55.285
<i>Scallops are overcooked!</i>

25:55.286 --> 25:56.452
<i>Rubber! Rubber.</i>

25:56.453 --> 25:57.887
Look at that.
Touch that one there.

25:57.888 --> 25:59.022
<i>Just touch it there.</i>

25:59.023 --> 26:00.990
Come on, get me
some more in there!

26:00.991 --> 26:02.225
<i>Go, go, Jacqueline.
Go!</i>

26:02.226 --> 26:04.260
You've got
the easiest appetizer.

26:04.261 --> 26:05.261
Yes, chef.

26:05.262 --> 26:06.829
me.

26:06.830 --> 26:08.164
Hey, you.

26:08.165 --> 26:09.599
<i>Yes, chef.
Okay?</i>

26:09.600 --> 26:12.001
Hey, you all.

26:12.002 --> 26:13.069
<i>Cold pizza,</i>

26:13.070 --> 26:14.070
cold fish and chips.

26:14.071 --> 26:15.805
Refire, urgently!

26:15.806 --> 26:17.540
What the hell is she thinking?

26:17.541 --> 26:19.175
We have to redo a whole ticket

26:19.176 --> 26:21.577
over one order
of scallops.

26:21.578 --> 26:22.845
This sucks.

26:22.846 --> 26:24.647
Ladies, this is only
gonna happen once, okay?

26:24.648 --> 26:27.650
While the red team
starts over on their first ticket,

26:27.651 --> 26:29.886
out in the dining room,
the hungry guests...

26:29.887 --> 26:31.688
I don't know if we're eating.

26:31.689 --> 26:33.723
Look for other
ways to amuse themselves.

26:33.724 --> 26:36.259
Where's chef Ramsay?
Chef Ramsay's in the kitchen.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.627
Chef Ramsay's in there.
He's cooking.

26:39.663 --> 26:41.831
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

26:41.832 --> 26:43.967
How long? Burger's ready.
Pizza's ready.

26:43.968 --> 26:45.868
Scallops in 30 seconds, Anthony.
Yes.

26:45.869 --> 26:47.870
The men are ready
with their second attempt

26:47.871 --> 26:49.038
at their first order.

26:49.039 --> 26:50.840
Chef, I think
you'll like this one.

26:50.841 --> 26:53.176
Scallops, chef.

26:53.177 --> 26:54.210
Burger.
Here you go, chef.

26:54.211 --> 26:55.945
Come on, guys.

26:55.946 --> 26:57.146
All we've done
since we've been here

26:57.147 --> 26:58.448
is fail and lose.

26:58.449 --> 27:00.450
We need to pull it together,
and we need to do this.

27:00.451 --> 27:02.218
Behind, behind, chef.
One pizza.

27:04.855 --> 27:06.823
Go, please.

27:06.824 --> 27:08.992
All right, guys, let's get it
the together, huh?

27:08.993 --> 27:11.227
It's a half
hour into dinner service...

27:11.228 --> 27:13.196
Risotto walking.
Scallops walking.

27:13.197 --> 27:15.198
Very good.
Go.

27:15.199 --> 27:16.399
And after a rough start,

27:16.400 --> 27:18.668
both teams have managed
to bounce back,

27:18.669 --> 27:21.204
averting disaster
in the dining room.

27:21.205 --> 27:22.905
Ah, I admire your patience.

27:22.906 --> 27:25.041
Yeah?
Ah, with a smile.

27:25.042 --> 27:26.309
With a smile.

27:26.310 --> 27:28.111
And back in the blue kitchen,

27:28.112 --> 27:30.913
chef Ramsay delivers
the next order.

27:30.914 --> 27:32.348
One scallop, one risotto,
one burger, one fish and chips.

27:32.349 --> 27:33.349
Yes, chef!

27:33.350 --> 27:34.717
Uh, guys...

27:34.718 --> 27:36.019
And one important detail.

27:36.020 --> 27:37.020
That's my family.

27:37.021 --> 27:39.022
Yes, chef!

27:39.023 --> 27:40.623
One risotto.
That's for the fam-fam.

27:40.624 --> 27:41.624
There's a lot at stake
right here.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.393
But we are coming together,

27:43.394 --> 27:45.194
and it's almost like
a symphony.

27:45.195 --> 27:46.429
I got a burger ready to go.

27:46.430 --> 27:47.597
I got fries ready.

27:47.598 --> 27:49.132
Ah, risotto's
looking beautiful.

27:49.133 --> 27:50.466
It's a beautiful thing.

27:50.467 --> 27:51.834
Chef, fish and chips
is right there.

27:51.835 --> 27:53.469
Beautiful.
Walking with the risottos.

27:53.470 --> 27:54.804
Risotto right behind you, chef.

27:54.805 --> 27:55.972
Scallops!

27:55.973 --> 27:57.573
<i>Scallops!
Jon!</i>

27:57.574 --> 27:59.242
I'll run. I got
your scallops right here, chef.

27:59.243 --> 28:01.310
Here you go, brother.
Ohh, I love you.

28:04.181 --> 28:05.681
Stone cold.

28:05.682 --> 28:06.816
Hey, all of you.

28:06.817 --> 28:08.818
You first,.
Come here.

28:08.819 --> 28:09.886
Oh,.

28:09.887 --> 28:11.788
No. This can't
be happening.

28:11.789 --> 28:13.489
Just touch that.
Just touch the burger.

28:13.490 --> 28:14.891
Oh,, chef.
Just touch it.

28:14.892 --> 28:16.259
I got one sitting
right there, chef.

28:16.260 --> 28:17.260
<i>I got another
one right there.</i>

28:17.261 --> 28:18.461
Who's that table?

28:18.462 --> 28:19.462
A cold cheeseburger.

28:19.463 --> 28:21.497
How the hell

28:21.498 --> 28:23.232
does something
like that happen?

28:23.233 --> 28:25.868
That's my family.

28:25.869 --> 28:28.838
He just brought
a perfect storm our way.

28:28.839 --> 28:29.839
Thanks, dude.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.007
At this stage of the game,

28:31.008 --> 28:33.076
I don't expect it, I'm sorry!

28:33.077 --> 28:34.510
It's not good enough!

28:34.511 --> 28:36.512
It's!

28:39.966 --> 28:41.366
An hour and a half

28:41.367 --> 28:43.368
into an early
family night dinner service,

28:43.369 --> 28:45.770
Ray has brought the blue kitchen
to a screeching halt.

28:45.771 --> 28:46.771
Just touch the burger.

28:46.772 --> 28:48.139
Oh,, chef.

28:48.140 --> 28:49.374
With a botched cheeseburger

28:49.375 --> 28:51.343
for a very important table.

28:51.344 --> 28:52.344
That's my family.

28:52.345 --> 28:54.145
I have one right there, chef.

28:54.146 --> 28:55.814
Get it together, man.

28:55.815 --> 28:57.315
A cold burger?

28:57.316 --> 28:59.117
I got a burger coming right up
here on refire.

28:59.118 --> 29:02.087
Hey, you had the audacity
to send it to my son.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.155
I wouldn't do that
to your family.

29:04.156 --> 29:05.257
Totally my fault.

29:05.258 --> 29:06.258
It was a bad mistake.

29:06.259 --> 29:07.526
I will dream of this all night,

29:07.527 --> 29:10.362
and I will remember it
years from now.

29:10.363 --> 29:11.429
Years from now.

29:11.430 --> 29:12.531
Burger's right here, Jon.

29:12.532 --> 29:13.665
You have fries?

29:13.666 --> 29:14.699
<i> I got fries.</i>

29:14.700 --> 29:15.700
<i>You're all set.</i>

29:15.701 --> 29:17.736
Here's your burger.

29:19.805 --> 29:20.872
Go, please.

29:20.873 --> 29:22.207
The blue team's refires

29:22.208 --> 29:23.241
have made it
out of the kitchen...

29:23.242 --> 29:25.143
<i>Thank you.
Bon appetit.</i>

29:25.144 --> 29:26.778
And to chef Ramsay's family.

29:26.779 --> 29:28.179
My stomach's sinking

29:28.180 --> 29:29.681
'cause I shouldn't have
served that burger.

29:29.682 --> 29:31.049
<i> And the blue team...
That's all right.</i>

29:31.050 --> 29:32.484
That's all right, baby.
Keep going. Keep going, chef.

29:32.485 --> 29:33.552
Pulls together to catch up

29:33.553 --> 29:34.586
on their tickets.

29:34.587 --> 29:35.987
<i>Stay focused, boys.</i>

29:35.988 --> 29:37.088
Stay focused, that's it.

29:37.089 --> 29:38.189
It's just food.

29:38.190 --> 29:39.858
Meanwhile, the red team...

29:39.859 --> 29:41.159
Service, please.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.394
Has completed their appetizers

29:42.395 --> 29:43.728
and children's meals.

29:43.729 --> 29:45.063
You, two Wellington,
one halibut.

29:45.064 --> 29:46.464
Yes, chef!
Fries, how long?

29:46.465 --> 29:48.266
Jack, how long do you need?

29:48.267 --> 29:49.434
I got six minutes.

29:49.435 --> 29:50.735
Six minutes, heard.

29:50.736 --> 29:52.504
It's now
up to Mary, on meat,

29:52.505 --> 29:53.605
and Jacqueline, on fish,

29:53.606 --> 29:55.440
to really deliver on entrees.

29:55.441 --> 29:57.142
Let's go.
Yes, chef!

29:57.143 --> 29:58.343
I'm kind of freaking out.

29:58.344 --> 30:00.412
I've been nominated
for elimination

30:00.413 --> 30:01.513
three times.

30:01.514 --> 30:03.214
And I have
no more chances left.

30:03.215 --> 30:04.816
I'm walking!

30:04.817 --> 30:05.817
Halibut garnish following.

30:05.818 --> 30:07.118
Chef, two Wellingtons.

30:07.119 --> 30:08.286
Where's the garnish?

30:08.287 --> 30:10.722
Hot, behind you.

30:10.723 --> 30:11.723
Mary!

30:11.724 --> 30:12.724
Yes, chef?

30:12.725 --> 30:13.725
They're beautifully cooked.

30:13.726 --> 30:14.759
Beautiful!

30:14.760 --> 30:15.827
Service, please.

30:15.828 --> 30:17.329
Mary has led her team

30:17.330 --> 30:18.930
to a successful start
on entrees...

30:18.931 --> 30:20.265
Good job, Mary!

30:20.266 --> 30:22.200
Mary's made a full, like, 180.

30:22.201 --> 30:25.003
She's really coming
into her own right now.

30:25.004 --> 30:26.037
Keep it going!

30:26.038 --> 30:27.038
Impressing her team...

30:27.039 --> 30:28.406
Wow.

30:28.407 --> 30:30.308
And their guests.

30:30.309 --> 30:32.544
Meanwhile,
over in the blue kitchen...

30:32.545 --> 30:34.779
Away now, Barret. Wake up!
Yes, chef.

30:34.780 --> 30:35.880
It's now Barret's turn

30:35.881 --> 30:37.482
to impress on the meat station.

30:37.483 --> 30:39.217
One halibut,
one lamb, one bass.

30:39.218 --> 30:40.619
<i>Let's go!
Yes, chef!</i>

30:40.620 --> 30:43.088
<i>We've won a challenge.</i>

30:43.089 --> 30:44.356
And one service.

30:44.357 --> 30:46.491
This is where Barret
needs to pull through.

30:46.492 --> 30:47.592
You about a minute
and a half out?

30:47.593 --> 30:48.927
Yes, minute and a half out!

30:48.928 --> 30:50.028
Michael, it's not cutting.

30:50.029 --> 30:51.296
Oh, there it is.
Okay.

30:51.297 --> 30:52.831
That's raw.
I'm gonna put it back in.

30:52.832 --> 30:55.900
Guys, lamb's gotta go in
for 30, 40 seconds more.

30:55.901 --> 30:57.302
<i>Heard.
What am I doing wrong?</i>

30:57.303 --> 30:58.803
Maybe I'm not
searing it long enough.

30:58.804 --> 31:00.405
Maybe I'm not leaving it
in the oven long enough.

31:00.406 --> 31:01.873
Maybe my oven temperature's
too low.

31:01.874 --> 31:03.408
Whatever it is,
I gotta figure it out

31:03.409 --> 31:04.643
and figure it out fast.

31:04.644 --> 31:06.578
Walking with halibut!
Walking with the bass!

31:06.579 --> 31:08.213
On your side, chef.
Lamb!

31:08.214 --> 31:09.214
Lamb's coming, chef.

31:09.215 --> 31:10.515
That's raw.

31:10.516 --> 31:11.883
Don't send it, then!

31:11.884 --> 31:13.451
Actually, you know what, Barret?
Take it up there.

31:13.452 --> 31:15.620
'Cause I will actually
enjoy this.

31:15.621 --> 31:16.988
Come on, leave me,
leave me, leave me.

31:16.989 --> 31:19.791
All right,
all right, all right.

31:19.792 --> 31:22.527
The lamb's raw.

31:22.528 --> 31:23.561
<i>Stop!</i>

31:23.562 --> 31:25.063
I got another one going in,
chef.

31:25.064 --> 31:26.331
<i>Barret, if you
knew it was raw,</i>

31:26.332 --> 31:27.399
why'd you bring it up to me?

31:27.400 --> 31:29.300
I'm sorry, chef.
Get it in the oven!

31:29.301 --> 31:31.136
Okay.
Take the thing!

31:31.137 --> 31:33.338
Got it, chef.
Go, chef, go, chef, go!

31:33.339 --> 31:34.973
I know that lamb is a bitch,

31:34.974 --> 31:36.975
but tie your boots up,
grab your,

31:36.976 --> 31:37.976
and let's go!

31:37.977 --> 31:39.310
Get it in the oven!

31:39.311 --> 31:41.479
I got it.
I believe in you. Get it done.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.748
While Barret's
teammates try to encourage him...

31:43.749 --> 31:44.749
We got it, buddy, come on.

31:44.750 --> 31:45.950
Out in the dining room,

31:45.951 --> 31:46.985
the customers...

31:46.986 --> 31:48.219
Where's our food?

31:48.220 --> 31:49.387
Not surprisingly

31:49.388 --> 31:51.756
are getting
a little discouraged.

31:51.757 --> 31:53.458
Lamb!

31:53.459 --> 31:54.459
Piping hot sauce!

31:54.460 --> 31:56.161
60 seconds on that, chef.

31:56.162 --> 31:57.429
Come on, Barret, please!

31:57.430 --> 31:58.630
Lamb coming to the window.

31:58.631 --> 31:59.631
Behind, behind, behind.

31:59.632 --> 32:00.632
<i>Lamb coming to the window.</i>

32:00.633 --> 32:02.701
Let's go.
Here you go, chef.

32:05.504 --> 32:07.072
Go, please.

32:07.073 --> 32:09.374
With Barret's
successful refire on the lamb,

32:09.375 --> 32:11.643
the men are beginning
to push out entrees.

32:11.644 --> 32:12.977
That looks amazing.

32:12.978 --> 32:14.145
Wow.

32:14.146 --> 32:15.146
Mmm.

32:15.147 --> 32:16.147
Meanwhile...

32:16.148 --> 32:17.549
Behind, behind.
Behind.

32:17.550 --> 32:18.583
The red team...

32:18.584 --> 32:20.819
Right here, chef.
Service, please.

32:20.820 --> 32:22.654
Has completed
over half of their entrees.

32:22.655 --> 32:23.855
Good job, ladies.

32:23.856 --> 32:25.790
But chef Ramsay is determined

32:25.791 --> 32:27.258
to get the blue side
of the dining room

32:27.259 --> 32:29.294
fed in sync with the red.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.962
Chicken, lamb, Wellington,
halibut... how long?

32:30.963 --> 32:32.831
Barret, chicken? Two?

32:32.832 --> 32:34.432
Ready.
Bass and chicken, right?

32:34.433 --> 32:36.367
<i>Are you good?
It's cooked enough?</i>

32:36.368 --> 32:38.536
This is cooked enough, right?

32:38.537 --> 32:40.538
Dude, are you...
do you need a second opinion?

32:40.539 --> 32:42.607
Yeah, second opinion.
Need a second opinion.

32:42.608 --> 32:44.175
It's... I don't know
if he would kick that back.

32:44.176 --> 32:45.410
Nah, he'd kick that back.

32:45.411 --> 32:46.644
Barret, are you serious?

32:46.645 --> 32:48.780
That shouldn't
go in the window.

32:48.781 --> 32:50.181
No way in hell, man.

32:50.182 --> 32:51.382
Barret, how long?

32:51.383 --> 32:52.884
Not yet.
I'm dragging the chicken.

32:52.885 --> 32:53.985
Barret, nothing's coming out!

32:53.986 --> 32:55.720
We got it, chef.
We're working on it.

32:55.721 --> 32:58.056
While Barret's
inconsistency on the meat station

32:58.057 --> 33:00.191
has stalled the blue kitchen
once again...

33:00.192 --> 33:01.593
It's going in the oven
right now.

33:01.594 --> 33:03.394
Back in the red kitchen...

33:03.395 --> 33:04.996
Pork, bass, Wellington...
how long?

33:04.997 --> 33:06.631
Four minutes, chef!

33:06.632 --> 33:08.133
The women are
just one ticket away

33:08.134 --> 33:09.200
from finishing.

33:09.201 --> 33:10.401
Last ticket.
Let's go.

33:10.402 --> 33:11.469
<i> Yes, chef.</i>

33:11.470 --> 33:13.271
Ned, do you have
the Wellington garnish?

33:13.272 --> 33:14.272
Yes, chef!

33:14.273 --> 33:15.273
Let's keep moving.

33:15.274 --> 33:16.574
Everything's just clicking.

33:16.575 --> 33:17.742
We're moving.
We're talking.

33:17.743 --> 33:19.744
Things are going.
Timing is perfect.

33:19.745 --> 33:21.379
This is what chef Ramsay
is looking for.

33:21.380 --> 33:24.282
Set up all the garnish,
then slice your Wellington.

33:24.283 --> 33:25.950
I'll walk
with the bass together.

33:25.951 --> 33:27.619
Heard.
I'm walking with garnish.

33:27.620 --> 33:29.220
Wellington.
Pork, Mary.

33:29.221 --> 33:30.655
Yes, chef!
Heard!

33:30.656 --> 33:32.090
Ready on bass!
Ready on the bass!

33:32.091 --> 33:33.224
Mary, let's go!

33:33.225 --> 33:34.292
Coming right now, chef!

33:34.293 --> 33:35.927
Behind you.

33:35.928 --> 33:36.928
Here's the Wellington.

33:36.929 --> 33:38.096
Wellington's over there.

33:38.097 --> 33:39.898
<i>Here's the pork.
Service, please.</i>

33:39.899 --> 33:41.499
Good job, ladies!

33:41.500 --> 33:43.735
Ladies, come here!

33:43.736 --> 33:44.836
Great job.

33:44.837 --> 33:46.905
The dining room
is full with children.

33:46.906 --> 33:48.473
Jump into the blue team

33:48.474 --> 33:50.575
and help me get
their entrees out.

33:50.576 --> 33:51.643
Let's go, all of you.

33:51.644 --> 33:52.644
All of you.
Yes, chef.

33:52.645 --> 33:54.212
I don't want to be a jerk,

33:54.213 --> 33:55.513
but we're totally blowing
these boys

33:55.514 --> 33:56.815
out of the water,

33:56.816 --> 33:59.284
and I'm really,
thoroughly enjoying it.

33:59.285 --> 34:00.385
Barret, what you got?
I'll help you.

34:00.386 --> 34:01.386
I'm good.
Stay off my station.

34:01.387 --> 34:02.453
I'm good, I'm good.

34:02.454 --> 34:04.355
The blue team,
they looking at us like,

34:04.356 --> 34:07.425
"Ah ah ah ah ah!
I don't need no help."

34:07.426 --> 34:10.128
Evidently, you do 'cause this
is a total cluster.

34:10.129 --> 34:12.096
One chicken here.

34:12.097 --> 34:13.731
I've got raw chicken here.

34:13.732 --> 34:15.900
That's for my wife.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.902
Hey!

34:17.902 --> 34:19.804
For chef James's wife,

34:19.804 --> 34:20.871
pink chicken.

34:20.873 --> 34:22.974
Raw fish, people can survive.

34:22.975 --> 34:24.809
Undercooked meat,
you can cook it more.

34:24.810 --> 34:26.277
Like, it's not gonna kill you.

34:26.277 --> 34:28.813
raw chicken
will kill you.

34:28.813 --> 34:30.681
Chef James's wife

34:30.683 --> 34:31.683
is pregnant.

34:31.684 --> 34:33.518
Oh, my gosh.

34:33.518 --> 34:34.853
I can't even look
chef James in the eye.

34:34.853 --> 34:36.920
He's like a triple black belt
in Tae Kwon Do.

34:36.922 --> 34:39.123
This dude could probably
me up right now.

34:39.123 --> 34:41.458
My family and James's family!

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
Red team, take over!
Let's go!

34:43.462 --> 34:45.429
drive them!

34:53.466 --> 34:55.467
It's two hours
into dinner service...

34:55.467 --> 34:56.902
Hey!

34:56.902 --> 34:58.069
For chef James's wife,

34:58.070 --> 34:59.504
pink chicken.

34:59.505 --> 35:01.039
And Barret's fatal mistake...

35:01.040 --> 35:03.708
Chef James's wife is pregnant.

35:03.709 --> 35:04.976
Oh, my gosh.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.645
Has pushed chef Ramsay

35:06.646 --> 35:07.879
to take drastic action.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.281
Red team, take over!
Let's go!

35:09.282 --> 35:10.415
Yes, chef!
Move!

35:10.416 --> 35:11.550
Do you have more chicken down?

35:11.551 --> 35:12.851
Yeah, one's in.

35:12.852 --> 35:14.286
Y'all know I'm not
enjoying this, right?

35:14.287 --> 35:15.287
Yeah.

35:15.288 --> 35:16.521
You wanna check your chicken,

35:16.522 --> 35:18.356
make sure it's good?
It's not good yet.

35:18.357 --> 35:20.892
I think the blue team doesn't
seem like they want our help,

35:20.893 --> 35:23.829
but once Barret sends up
that raw chicken,

35:23.830 --> 35:25.764
he doesn't have anything else
to say to me.

35:25.765 --> 35:27.032
We need five minutes,
six mites.

35:27.033 --> 35:29.067
<i>Six minutes out
on that chicken!</i>

35:29.068 --> 35:30.168
Six minutes!

35:30.169 --> 35:33.205
Mary is on the money tonight.

35:33.206 --> 35:35.073
I'm like, "Dang, Mary!"

35:35.074 --> 35:37.275
The little lamb has spoken up.

35:37.276 --> 35:38.443
Jon, you're good?

35:38.444 --> 35:39.511
I'm listening to your times,

35:39.512 --> 35:41.246
and I'm timing myself.
Awesome.

35:41.247 --> 35:42.747
Get it, bitch!
Get it.

35:42.748 --> 35:45.050
When Jon's ready to walk,
we're ready to walk.

35:45.051 --> 35:46.418
Okay.
Let garnish go first.

35:46.419 --> 35:48.954
Garnish walking.

35:48.955 --> 35:50.856
Walking the chicken.

35:53.926 --> 35:55.694
Chicken.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.062
When you're walking...
Mary, thank you.

35:57.063 --> 35:58.496
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

35:58.497 --> 35:59.998
I'm the chef to beat tonight.

35:59.999 --> 36:02.400
We just needed to make sure
that it was perfect.

36:03.936 --> 36:05.737
I'm stronger and stronger
every day,

36:05.738 --> 36:08.206
and I'm gonna come out on top.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.941
Come on, guys.
Finish strong!

36:09.942 --> 36:11.443
With the women's help...

36:11.444 --> 36:12.544
Service!

36:12.545 --> 36:14.079
The men have humbly

36:14.080 --> 36:15.247
finished their entrees,

36:15.248 --> 36:17.449
and every diner
has now been served.

36:17.450 --> 36:18.516
Mmm, yeah.

36:18.517 --> 36:19.651
That is good.

36:19.652 --> 36:21.019
Thank you, guys.
You're welcome, chef.

36:21.020 --> 36:22.554
I don't know what we
would have done without you.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.089
All we needed to do
was refire one thing.

36:24.090 --> 36:25.724
I'm gonna beat myself up
for the next couple hours

36:25.725 --> 36:27.359
about the service.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.727
It's pretty embarrassing.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.695
They just communicate way better
than we do, guys.

36:30.696 --> 36:32.764
That's it.

36:33.933 --> 36:36.201
Blue team, come here.

36:37.870 --> 36:40.772
You are getting killed
by the women.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.909
<i>Blue team,</i>

36:43.910 --> 36:45.677
two words that all of you

36:45.678 --> 36:47.746
have become
very familiar with...

36:47.747 --> 36:50.582
"You've lost."

36:50.583 --> 36:51.950
<i>Head upstairs.</i>

36:51.951 --> 36:55.053
Nominate
your two weakest chefs.

36:55.054 --> 36:58.356
Get out of here, guys.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.028
My blood's boiling right now.

37:03.029 --> 37:04.529
I don't need
this.

37:04.530 --> 37:07.332
These people could
just crash and burn.

37:07.333 --> 37:08.867
If you can't do your job,

37:08.868 --> 37:10.602
I get you the
out of there.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.771
I never worked
with so many amateurs

37:12.772 --> 37:14.039
in this business in my life.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.408
Everybody has to talk
in this place.

37:16.409 --> 37:17.776
It's a show.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.411
<i>Does anybody know
what they're doing?</i>

37:19.412 --> 37:21.112
I know what the 's
going on!

37:21.113 --> 37:22.914
Maybe this is
how I need to be in the kitchen.

37:22.915 --> 37:24.215
'Cause I'm hot
right now.

37:24.216 --> 37:26.184
I'm embarrassed.

37:26.185 --> 37:28.153
Ray, the burger.

37:28.154 --> 37:29.154
<i>I don't know
what to tell you.</i>

37:29.155 --> 37:30.155
All night long,

37:30.156 --> 37:31.523
my burgers were perfect.

37:31.524 --> 37:33.224
I only messed up one thing.

37:33.225 --> 37:34.960
It just happened to be
chef Ramsay's kid.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.095
I am not
the weakest chef tonight.

37:37.096 --> 37:38.697
I'm telling you, I'm not.

37:38.698 --> 37:41.900
Barret, raw chicken to
chef James's pregnant wife.

37:41.901 --> 37:43.268
Like, seriously.

37:43.269 --> 37:44.669
Barret,
you're moving backwards.

37:44.670 --> 37:46.972
You gotta get your head out
of your, man, please.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.740
<i> I don't blame anybody
for putting me up there.</i>

37:48.741 --> 37:49.841
I shouldn't have put
that chicken out.

37:49.842 --> 37:51.109
I should have checked it
again and again.

37:51.110 --> 37:52.677
<i>But I'm not the only one
who up.</i>

37:52.678 --> 37:56.014
Dan should be
going home tonight.

37:56.015 --> 37:57.515
<i>He's not a team player.</i>

37:57.516 --> 37:58.616
If I'm basing it
on the whole thing,

37:58.617 --> 37:59.985
it would be Dan.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.587
Today on prep,
you were pussyfooting around.

38:02.588 --> 38:03.888
And Dan us
out of the gate

38:03.889 --> 38:05.323
with the pizzas.

38:05.324 --> 38:06.591
If you're gonna put me up

38:06.592 --> 38:08.393
for some reasons,
that's fine.

38:08.394 --> 38:10.362
Chef Ramsay knows better.
He sees what's going on.

38:10.363 --> 38:12.897
<i> At some point in
time, y'all wake up.</i>

38:12.898 --> 38:14.766
Honestly.
Some point in time,

38:14.767 --> 38:16.368
you gotta really
wake the up.

38:16.369 --> 38:17.669
<i>All he's gonna
do is he's gonna</i>

38:17.670 --> 38:18.970
<i>go through
his whole life complaining.</i>

38:18.971 --> 38:20.105
I'm not talking
to you right now,

38:20.106 --> 38:21.473
so shut the up.

38:21.474 --> 38:22.640
If I wasn't here,
I'd punch you in the face.

38:22.641 --> 38:23.942
But we are here, so...
Exactly.

38:23.943 --> 38:25.210
You ain't gonna do,
so shut up.

38:25.211 --> 38:26.277
<i>Don't say nothin'.
Don't worry.</i>

38:26.278 --> 38:27.545
You ain't gonna
do, Barret.

38:27.546 --> 38:29.714
You're just a little girl.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.454
*

38:43.863 --> 38:45.597
Blue team, have you
reached a decision?

38:45.598 --> 38:47.365
Yes, chef.

38:47.366 --> 38:48.666
<i>Jon, first nominee</i>

38:48.667 --> 38:49.934
and why, please.

38:49.935 --> 38:52.103
First nominee is Barret, chef.

38:53.305 --> 38:55.306
<i>Solely based on the chicken</i>

38:55.307 --> 38:57.876
that was raw
for chef James's wife.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.110
Seven months pregnant.

38:59.111 --> 39:01.112
Second nominee and why.

39:01.113 --> 39:02.480
The second nominee...

39:13.539 --> 39:16.641
After an epic failure
on the family night dinner service,

39:16.642 --> 39:18.876
the blue team was forced
to nominate two chefs

39:18.877 --> 39:20.511
for elimination.

39:20.512 --> 39:21.546
Their first selection was...

39:21.547 --> 39:24.182
Barret, chef.

39:24.183 --> 39:25.416
Second nominee and why.

39:25.417 --> 39:29.354
The second nominee...

39:29.355 --> 39:31.222
Uh...

39:31.223 --> 39:33.558
Is Dan.

39:33.559 --> 39:35.860
<i>Dan walked around all day
with a thumb up his.</i>

39:35.861 --> 39:37.729
<i>It's like he just
could care less</i>

39:37.730 --> 39:38.863
about being part of the team

39:38.864 --> 39:41.065
and helping us succeed.

39:41.066 --> 39:42.734
Dan, Barret.

39:42.735 --> 39:44.402
<i>Step forward, please.</i>

39:44.403 --> 39:48.206
<i>Let's go.</i>

39:48.207 --> 39:50.942
Dan, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:50.943 --> 39:52.310
<i>I think I should
stay in Hell's Kitchen</i>

39:52.311 --> 39:54.245
'cause I showed you
that I do know how to cook.

39:54.246 --> 39:55.813
What?

39:55.814 --> 39:56.781
<i>How can we screw up</i>

39:56.782 --> 39:59.217
a pizza, Dan?

39:59.218 --> 40:01.419
You are becoming
a bit of an outcast.

40:01.420 --> 40:03.755
<i>The team almost despise you.</i>

40:03.756 --> 40:06.157
My team doesn't like me.
I don't give a.

40:06.158 --> 40:07.592
I'm not expecting you
to be best friends,

40:07.593 --> 40:11.229
but you have to work together.

40:11.230 --> 40:12.997
Barret.

40:12.998 --> 40:14.132
<i>At this stage of the game,</i>

40:14.133 --> 40:15.733
you should be getting stronger.

40:15.734 --> 40:16.734
I am getting stronger, chef.

40:16.735 --> 40:18.836
You...

40:18.837 --> 40:20.338
No, I... I get knocked down,
I get back up.

40:20.339 --> 40:21.673
You're going backwards.

40:21.674 --> 40:23.374
<i>And at times, watching you,</i>

40:23.375 --> 40:24.475
I don't think
you give a.

40:24.476 --> 40:25.710
<i>I do give a.
Really?</i>

40:25.711 --> 40:27.612
It's not just
about the fancy hair and...

40:27.613 --> 40:28.713
No, really.

40:28.714 --> 40:31.716
You got a funny way
of showing it.

40:31.717 --> 40:33.317
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

40:38.524 --> 40:42.593
*

40:43.053 --> 40:44.595
Dan.

40:44.596 --> 40:46.964
Give me your jacket, big boy.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.301
Your time is done.

40:50.302 --> 40:53.037
Thank you, chef.
Thank you.

40:56.408 --> 41:00.611
Barret, you are
a weapons-grade douchebag.

41:00.612 --> 41:02.113
Zach,
you're a two-faced.

41:02.114 --> 41:05.283
Michael, you are
s- t-o-o-p-i-d stupid.

41:05.284 --> 41:09.053
My message to the blue team
is shove it up your.

41:09.054 --> 41:11.189
<i> Blue team,
you have managed</i>

41:11.190 --> 41:14.492
one win
out of six dinner services.

41:14.493 --> 41:16.160
<i>One win!</i>

41:16.161 --> 41:19.230
Out of six challenges!

41:19.231 --> 41:21.132
<i>Unless I see a major upgrade,</i>

41:21.133 --> 41:24.368
I will be eliminating
more than one at a time.

41:26.438 --> 41:28.539
Get out of here.

41:28.540 --> 41:32.243
Being dominated like this
is just embarrassing.

41:32.244 --> 41:34.011
But, you know, we can all say,

41:34.012 --> 41:36.647
"Oh, it's a new blue team.
Oh, it's gonna change."

41:36.648 --> 41:38.382
Until you prove it
in that kitchen,

41:38.383 --> 41:40.084
it don't mean.

41:40.085 --> 41:42.887
The red team, although
we're on a winning streak,

41:42.888 --> 41:44.655
we're beating a horrible team.

41:44.656 --> 41:48.126
Call me crazy, but just women
might be the final six.

41:48.127 --> 41:50.294
This is my dream.
For him to say that to me,

41:50.295 --> 41:51.429
it really bothers me.

41:51.430 --> 41:54.999
really,
really just...

41:55.000 --> 41:57.401
Dan was just too
much of a wild card.

41:57.402 --> 42:01.272
There's no way I'm betting
a restaurant in Vegas on him.

42:04.977 --> 42:06.110
Next time...

42:06.111 --> 42:08.813
Somebody get me
the out of here now.

42:08.814 --> 42:11.015
One chef loses his confidence...

42:11.016 --> 42:13.184
I'm sick of losing.
What the, man?

42:13.185 --> 42:15.219
And you won't
believe what happens...

42:16.255 --> 42:18.589
When he loses his mind.

42:18.590 --> 42:21.359
Damn, you pulled
a Britney Spears on us.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.461
And a surprise
ingredient from the red team...

42:23.462 --> 42:26.531
Um, I found a hair in my food.

42:26.532 --> 42:27.899
Pretty disgusting.

42:27.900 --> 42:29.734
God almighty.
A hair?

42:29.735 --> 42:32.036
Unleashes a
firestorm in the kitchen.

42:32.037 --> 42:34.372
I want better!
Go home!

42:34.373 --> 42:35.973
That spreads to the dorms.

42:35.974 --> 42:37.909
I'm not shutting
the up!

42:37.910 --> 42:39.710
You're going on and on
and on, and it's done!

42:39.711 --> 42:42.780
And threatens to drive
one chef out of Hell's Kitchen...

42:42.781 --> 42:43.815
I'm just packing my.

42:43.816 --> 42:45.116
Forever.

42:45.117 --> 42:47.251
Bitch, I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

42:47.252 --> 42:49.153
And she may
not be the only one.

42:49.154 --> 42:50.388
Ray, I'm done!
It's over.

42:50.389 --> 42:51.556
Over!

42:51.557 --> 42:52.523
All next time

42:52.524 --> 42:53.558
on a cutthroat...

42:53.559 --> 42:55.359
raw!
This is a disaster.
