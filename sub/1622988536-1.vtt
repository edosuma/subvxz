00:34.911 --> 00:37.379

Yeah but do they know our music?

01:11.681 --> 01:13.750
- I will check.
- Are you serious?

01:13.783 --> 01:16.351
How could you not have
checked that before?

01:16.385 --> 01:18.420

at the same time.

01:39.008 --> 01:40.643
I'm not fucking Ed Sheeran.

01:40.677 --> 01:44.881
You think I should sing
the same melody and...

01:44.914 --> 01:46.448
you don't know
what's going on do you?

01:46.481 --> 01:48.550
I write most of the songs
but, um.

01:48.584 --> 01:50.385
Yeah, I think for the new album

01:50.419 --> 01:52.554
I've been definitely writing
a little bit more lyrically.

01:52.588 --> 01:54.757
The first record
they're all my songs.

01:54.791 --> 01:57.727
I have a couple of songs
that I've already written.

one of the best bands

03:07.997 --> 03:09.665
that has ever lived.

03:09.699 --> 03:13.836
- And girls at that...
- What is that supposed to mean?

03:13.870 --> 03:16.471
- On our way to becoming female!
- Can I get a Glass Heart

03:16.505 --> 03:19.776
- picture please?
- Hello, everyone turn around

03:19.809 --> 03:21.844
- and smile, cheese.
- Happy faces.

03:21.878 --> 03:26.381
I look like a girl now.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.917
It was a long journey,
the songs are better.

03:27.950 --> 03:29.719
We're getting better.

03:29.752 --> 03:32.789
To the beginning
to a long, long career.

03:32.822 --> 03:34.957
And onto the next
fucking record.

03:40.663 --> 03:42.330
Woo!

03:47.837 --> 03:49.839
All right.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.910
Just keep hitting the snare.

04:27.944 --> 04:29.377
I'm gonna check levels
and see how it songs.

04:29.411 --> 04:30.813
- What?
- Just gotta keep hitting

04:30.847 --> 04:32.480
the snare, do it.

04:45.527 --> 04:46.863
Let's get them
with a little more space

04:46.896 --> 04:48.064
in between the hits please.

04:48.097 --> 04:49.966
- Sure.
- Thanks.

05:14.957 --> 05:17.960
I feel like it needs
to be tuned a little, no.

05:17.994 --> 05:20.796
I think maybe we should
take it apart actually

05:20.830 --> 05:22.665
and just start,
you know, piece by piece.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.600
Just to get it
because when Jess comes in

05:24.634 --> 05:26.534
she's just gonna wanna go,
you know.

05:26.568 --> 05:28.536
Yeah, sure.

05:28.570 --> 05:32.540
I think I might have
to go rest for a little bit

05:32.574 --> 05:36.646
and I'll come back,
we'll finish it up.

05:36.679 --> 05:40.415
- Yup.
- Okay, sure, sure.

05:53.062 --> 05:54.830
Good morning.

05:54.864 --> 05:57.099
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.801
How's it going?

05:58.834 --> 06:00.736
Good, I think
everything's set up.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.504
Looks good, yeah. I think
the girls are still asleep.

06:02.537 --> 06:03.873
I just wanted to get in,

06:03.906 --> 06:05.540
get a head start,
be in the space

06:05.573 --> 06:06.943
kind of alone for a sec,
you know.

06:06.976 --> 06:08.945
Okay, the piano's set up
over there, so.

06:08.978 --> 06:10.980
Yes, right, great.

06:11.013 --> 06:11.847
Go ahead, I'll leave you to it.

06:11.881 --> 06:15.184
Yeah, looks good.

06:15.217 --> 06:17.186
Looks good, thank you.

06:17.219 --> 06:19.722
Yeah.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.796
Mhm.

06:35.304 --> 06:37.073
You know,
it's the same as always

06:37.106 --> 06:40.743
but it's like
if my mind is back at home

06:40.776 --> 06:42.611
then my mind's not here.

06:42.645 --> 06:45.748
And um, it really needs
to be here.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.751
And um...

06:48.784 --> 06:51.087
And I'm doing my best.

07:08.570 --> 07:10.606
- Uh, Hazel?
- Yeah.

07:10.639 --> 07:15.144
This chair, I feel like is not
just like supportive.

07:15.177 --> 07:17.847
Yeah, we need another chair
and then also, there's this.

07:17.880 --> 07:18.714
See?

07:21.984 --> 07:23.786
- Yeah, that's not good is it?
- Yeah, you thought

07:23.819 --> 07:26.022
if you'd play it
it would sound different?

07:26.055 --> 07:27.323
- I'll get another chair.
- Yeah.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.243
Um, I was hoping to maybe.

07:47.276 --> 07:50.179
Um...

07:50.212 --> 07:52.815
Kelly, might...

07:52.848 --> 07:58.154
um, get some material.

07:58.187 --> 08:03.092
- Spit it out, Mark.
- Together.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.896
Do you... can I just talk to you,
Jessica?

08:06.929 --> 08:08.664
Can I just talk to you?

08:08.697 --> 08:11.333
Can I just talk to a person?

08:11.367 --> 08:16.105
What normally happens
when Kelly gets brain block?

08:16.138 --> 08:18.207
She never has before.

08:32.955 --> 08:36.125
No, I know, I don't want to be
here either right now.

08:36.158 --> 08:40.162
But um, there's no daylight

08:40.196 --> 08:43.631
and the days go by
and it's, ugh,

08:43.666 --> 08:46.836
honestly, I'm doing my best.

08:46.869 --> 08:49.205
- Oh, found a piano stool.
- No, that's not it.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.107
- Why?
- Because it's for a piano stool

08:51.140 --> 08:55.010
this is a keyboard.
It's a very different level.

09:22.138 --> 09:23.339
Hello.

09:23.372 --> 09:25.274
Hello.

09:25.307 --> 09:26.775
Yeah.

09:26.809 --> 09:28.978
Um, um, um.

09:29.011 --> 09:32.214
I'm sorry about yesterday.

09:32.248 --> 09:34.316
Yeah, no, it's just never.

09:34.350 --> 09:36.285
It's never.

09:36.318 --> 09:38.053
It's never a good time.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.042
You know, but you're all right.

10:00.075 --> 10:02.778
Gazza's all right.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.246
I'm here.

10:04.280 --> 10:09.018
So you know... No, no, no, no.

10:09.051 --> 10:10.920
Look, it's just for a bit longer

10:10.953 --> 10:14.924
and then... and then maybe
a bit longer after that.

10:16.859 --> 10:18.194
We're all dancing around
the fact

10:18.227 --> 10:21.330
that Kelly's
not written anything.

10:21.363 --> 10:22.765
I think we're going through
a process at the moment.

10:22.798 --> 10:24.333
Okay, well look, we're cooped up

10:24.366 --> 10:26.936
in this fucking freezing studio.

10:26.969 --> 10:28.904
There's no phone reception.

10:28.938 --> 10:30.272
Explain to me
what the process is

10:30.306 --> 10:32.241
because as far as I'm concerned

10:32.274 --> 10:33.809
no one is writing any songs

10:33.842 --> 10:36.845
and there is no process.

10:54.396 --> 10:56.966
I'm trying to create
some sort of environment

10:56.999 --> 10:59.268
where she can be productive

10:59.301 --> 11:01.136
and she can get up everyday

11:01.170 --> 11:04.240
and write a track and you know,

11:04.273 --> 11:05.975
we've got all the facilities
right here

11:06.008 --> 11:09.812
and it's just sitting
over there getting dust...

11:17.152 --> 11:19.021
Kelly.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.923
<i>Guten morgen.</i>

11:20.956 --> 11:22.925
- Ugh.
- We've got to go

11:22.958 --> 11:28.130
- and do some recording.
- Mhm.

11:28.163 --> 11:31.367
I need to go to sleep
for a little longer.

11:34.036 --> 11:36.005
Aren't there some old songs

11:36.038 --> 11:39.275
that she can sort of use
and start from?

11:39.308 --> 11:43.145
You know, something...
something left over

11:43.178 --> 11:46.215
from the... from the last album?

11:46.248 --> 11:48.517
That she can sort of recycle?

11:48.550 --> 11:50.819
Come on,
we can't do it without you.

11:50.853 --> 11:52.821
- Mhm.
- Can we?

11:52.855 --> 11:55.958
- Is she awake yet?
- No.

11:55.991 --> 11:57.893
Oh, well then why don't you go
and try to wake her ass up?

11:57.926 --> 12:01.997
She takes at least an hour to
fucking put makeup on anyway.

12:02.031 --> 12:04.266
'Cause you're my priority.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.602
- Am I?
- Yeah.

12:05.635 --> 12:07.469
I came to you first.

12:07.503 --> 12:10.839
'Cause you're my little star.

12:10.873 --> 12:13.042
♪ Twinkle twinkle ♪

12:13.075 --> 12:15.144
♪ Little star ♪

12:23.653 --> 12:25.354
- Hello.
- Hey.

12:25.387 --> 12:26.589
Scare ya?

12:26.623 --> 12:29.525
- No, no, no.
- What are you doing?

12:29.558 --> 12:33.095
Just... just... just having a...
having a sandwich

12:33.128 --> 12:35.598
and having a relax.

12:35.632 --> 12:37.099
You should be careful
about bringing liquids

12:37.132 --> 12:39.968
and food
into the recording area.

12:40.002 --> 12:42.171
Just not getting it
too messy, you know.

12:42.204 --> 12:44.039
Mhm.

12:44.073 --> 12:45.140
How are you?
You all right?

12:45.174 --> 12:47.309
Yeah, I just, um

12:47.343 --> 12:52.081
I feel asleep and didn't wake up
longer than I thought, so.

12:52.114 --> 12:55.384
- I'm a little, yeah.
- A bit more relaxed.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.553
Probably it's good
for your brain.

12:57.587 --> 12:59.288
You know, for when
you're thinking about stuff

12:59.321 --> 13:01.156
and writing stuff
and creating stuff.

13:01.190 --> 13:03.258
I think probably
it's good, yeah?

13:03.292 --> 13:07.296
I don't know, I don't do it.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.298
Kelly's always gone
writing words down.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.066
She's a really talented
song writer.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.968
- She's an amazing song writer.
- And she get the credit for that

13:13.001 --> 13:15.137
and... and you never know,

13:15.170 --> 13:17.239
her secluding herself
and us being in this situation

13:17.272 --> 13:20.109
it might... that might be
her method to her madness.

13:20.142 --> 13:21.944
You know,
she's always worked like that.

13:21.977 --> 13:23.646
No, she's not always
worked like that.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.915
She's always found it
really easy to write something

13:26.949 --> 13:29.184
and I just... I feel like
we're all dancing around

13:29.218 --> 13:33.055
the fact that she's clearly
got a writer's block.

13:48.638 --> 13:50.472
On that topic... on that subject

13:50.506 --> 13:53.275
and in terms of you know,
writing stuff,

13:53.308 --> 13:54.943
how are you getting along?

13:54.977 --> 13:57.980
Do you think you're
making any headway?

13:58.013 --> 14:00.583
- I work on some songs.
- Yeah.

14:00.617 --> 14:02.351
And I have like a melody of one.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.019
Yeah and what's that...
what are they?

14:04.052 --> 14:05.722
- Are they good?
- Yeah, they're fine.

14:05.755 --> 14:10.492
- I mean, how's it sounding?
- Yeah, I mean I just need more,

14:10.526 --> 14:12.194
- I just some, you know...
- Help?

14:12.227 --> 14:16.231
No, I don't need help,
I just need time to like...

14:16.265 --> 14:18.133
- we talked about this.
- Sure, yeah.

14:18.167 --> 14:20.302
I need the time to process it
in the way

14:20.335 --> 14:22.004
and in this space,
that's the whole point

14:22.037 --> 14:23.305
why we came out here.

14:23.338 --> 14:24.973
To be separated from everything.

14:28.110 --> 14:30.145
That's amazing.

14:30.179 --> 14:32.514
That you started writing,

14:32.548 --> 14:34.249
you really relaxed into it
and that's great.

14:34.283 --> 14:36.151
- Yeah.
- Oh!

14:36.185 --> 14:38.487
- Yeah, it's... it's...
- A big weight off your mind

14:38.520 --> 14:41.624
- I'd imagine that you, you know.
- I mean, that's not how writing

14:41.658 --> 14:43.660
works, it's not just like,
oh here it is.

14:43.693 --> 14:46.629
No, it's like... it's a proc...

14:46.663 --> 14:48.130
the whole album
has to be cohesive too.

14:48.163 --> 14:50.466
So in a way I'm writing

14:50.499 --> 14:52.301
like a theme
for the whole record

14:52.334 --> 14:54.002
not just in one individual song.

14:54.036 --> 14:55.772
It's a concept piece
starting with the story,

14:55.805 --> 14:57.239
ending with the end
of the story.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.373
- Concept album?
- Yeah.

14:58.407 --> 15:00.777
Yeah, yeah, yeah and where
everything comes together

15:00.810 --> 15:02.679
- and it's all...
- Exactly, so I'm kind of working

15:02.712 --> 15:04.714
from the outside in
instead of working on

15:04.747 --> 15:07.249
a particular song,
so it's harder to express.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.752
Exactly, all the tunes
work together.

15:09.786 --> 15:11.688
- Yeah.
- All the themes work together.

15:11.721 --> 15:13.222
All the band mates
work together.

15:13.255 --> 15:15.123
Everyone's working together,
you know.

15:15.157 --> 15:17.159
- Yeah.
- Everyone's coming together

15:17.192 --> 15:19.762
- and making an amazing album.
- Well.

15:19.796 --> 15:21.430
Everyone's doing their best.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.433
I'm writing... I have to write it.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.567
- I'm writing it and then...
- Obviously it's hard

15:25.602 --> 15:27.536
as well right, it's hard?

15:27.569 --> 15:29.404
Of course it's hard,
of course it's hard.

15:29.438 --> 15:31.507
The first album
was a massive success

15:31.540 --> 15:34.109
but everybody knows that
it's about the second album.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.680
So as you can imagine,
the pressure is really on

15:37.714 --> 15:41.149
to write something
and I've got... I mean,

15:41.183 --> 15:42.484
I've got a lot of songs
but I would say

15:42.518 --> 15:44.687
six or seven like concrete ones

15:44.721 --> 15:46.421
that I know everyone
gonna really like

15:46.455 --> 15:48.257
but no one is willing
to listen to them.

15:48.290 --> 15:51.560
I mean, that's almost the first
good news I've heard all day.

15:51.594 --> 15:53.395
- Yeah?
- So I'm so grateful

15:53.428 --> 15:55.097
that you came up to me
to share that with me.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.533
- Oh, thank fuck.
- That's great.

15:57.566 --> 15:59.368
It's literally music
to my ears.

15:59.401 --> 16:00.837
So we're gonna demo my songs?

16:00.870 --> 16:03.205
You're a grown-up, yeah?

16:03.238 --> 16:07.175
You've been a member
of the human race

16:07.209 --> 16:09.344
all your life, haven't you and...

16:09.378 --> 16:10.747
What are you getting at?
I don't?

16:10.780 --> 16:12.582
Just that the world doesn't work
like that, does it.

16:12.615 --> 16:13.850
The world doesn't work...

16:13.883 --> 16:15.450
Okay, well, how about
you tell me

16:15.484 --> 16:17.620
how you see the next
few weeks progressing.

16:17.654 --> 16:20.255
You explain that to me.

16:20.289 --> 16:23.191
She just lies
on the floor for hours

16:23.225 --> 16:25.527
and hours become days

16:25.561 --> 16:28.330
and she's not... she's not
done anything

16:28.363 --> 16:32.267
except for a fucking
ice cream van jingle.

16:32.301 --> 16:35.738
You're a drummer that can't drum
because you're not...

16:35.772 --> 16:37.406
because you haven't got
the material to drum.

16:37.439 --> 16:38.741
Oh, I was gonna say, I can drum.

16:38.775 --> 16:41.143
Yeah, I know you can drum.

16:41.176 --> 16:46.415
I'm in the middle of
a million pound record deal.

16:46.448 --> 16:48.651
Yeah but...

16:48.685 --> 16:51.119
Yeah, I don't...

16:51.153 --> 16:53.756
My... You know... Come on.

16:53.790 --> 16:57.259
My mind is in other places.

16:57.292 --> 16:58.861
I'm sorry that he hasn't had
enough money

16:58.895 --> 17:02.397
for lunch for two weeks.

17:02.431 --> 17:03.600
Yeah, no of course.

17:03.633 --> 17:06.401
At large, I just, ugh.

17:06.435 --> 17:07.837
Why are we here?

17:07.869 --> 17:09.839
Because of the songs
that I wrote, right.

17:09.872 --> 17:11.406
Why are we here?
Because of the first record.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.241
We're all here because
of the first record.

17:13.275 --> 17:14.443
- We're here...
- Okay, I'm the one who got us

17:14.476 --> 17:16.377
- into this studio.
- Mhm.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.614
I'm the one who made
the connections

17:17.646 --> 17:19.848
and I'm bringing
everyone along with me.

17:19.882 --> 17:22.384
So let me have my space
and process it

17:22.416 --> 17:24.152
the way that I need
to fucking process it.

17:24.185 --> 17:25.420
I don't know why
I need to keep explaining it.

17:25.454 --> 17:27.255
This... Now I'm all worked up.

17:27.289 --> 17:28.658
I'm not going to be able
to record today.

17:28.691 --> 17:31.594
Ugh.

17:43.673 --> 17:46.508
With a swish of the door
you've come in here

17:46.541 --> 17:49.544
and you've lightened up
my life with amazing music.

17:49.579 --> 17:51.346
You've got six or seven tracks
that are ready

17:51.380 --> 17:53.850
to go to demo and I think
this is great news.

17:53.883 --> 17:56.586
I agree with you! I agree
with you! I agree with you!

17:56.619 --> 17:58.420
I agree with you!

17:58.453 --> 17:59.889
I agree with you.

17:59.922 --> 18:03.458
I agree with you!

18:03.492 --> 18:04.927
You've just said
we're gonna demo my songs.

18:04.961 --> 18:06.629
- So we're going to do that then.
- Yeah, I'm not...

18:06.663 --> 18:08.296
Yes, let's do it.

18:08.330 --> 18:10.365
All I'm saying is that,
you know,

18:10.399 --> 18:12.735
obviously there's a lot of
stress, there's a lot of noise,

18:12.769 --> 18:14.637
there's a lot of everything...
It would be quite good

18:14.671 --> 18:16.773
to sort of like take some
of that stress of you.

18:16.806 --> 18:18.775
You're saying that, you know,

18:18.808 --> 18:21.678
Alice has thrown together
a few chords of whatever

18:21.711 --> 18:23.880
but do you know,
they might not be a whole song

18:23.913 --> 18:25.782
but do you think they might be
like a bit of a song?

18:25.815 --> 18:27.717
Do you think there might be
a bit of a song in there

18:27.750 --> 18:29.418
- that you can kind of like...
- Are you trying to say that we

18:29.451 --> 18:31.921
should be recording
Alice's songs for Glass Heart?

18:31.954 --> 18:34.356
- For this album?
- I don't even know.

18:34.389 --> 18:35.692
I haven't even heard them.

18:35.725 --> 18:37.259
I don't even know
if they're in tune

18:37.292 --> 18:39.394
- but like... but...
- So you're like, why not.

18:39.428 --> 18:41.363
Let's just put it on the record
when we're at this

18:41.396 --> 18:44.299
expensive recording studio
that we only have five weeks at.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.836
I'm hiring you guys, you guys
are here to work for me.

18:46.869 --> 18:49.471
The whole point is to allow me
to have the space.

18:49.504 --> 18:50.973
If anything, Jess is the one
who's like helping me

18:51.007 --> 18:54.276
write the beats.

18:55.778 --> 18:59.916
Will you, for me,
to make her happy...

18:59.949 --> 19:01.651
Why are we trying
to make her happy?

19:01.684 --> 19:04.319
What do you have feelings
for her now?

19:04.352 --> 19:06.521
Control yourself, man.

19:06.555 --> 19:08.024
For real.

19:08.057 --> 19:10.325
I know it's hard being
in a confined space

19:10.358 --> 19:12.595
with young women but you
can't respond to their energy

19:12.628 --> 19:13.763
just because they want
to get things out of you.

19:13.796 --> 19:15.665
She is manipulating you, dude.

19:15.698 --> 19:17.332
She's manipulating all of us.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.935
The girl's more aware
of how she looks.

19:18.968 --> 19:20.803
Every time I see her,
no matter what, she's done up.

19:20.837 --> 19:22.739
Her hair's blown dried straight,
she's got a full plate

19:22.772 --> 19:25.273
of makeup on, I'm like,
who are you doing this for?

19:25.307 --> 19:27.577
'Cause she's taking selfies.
I'll find some other thing.

19:27.610 --> 19:29.846
I really think the phone has
disconnected her from reality.

19:29.879 --> 19:32.547
Yeah, I agree
and that's the problem

19:32.582 --> 19:36.351
with the whole... the whole
generation of like,

19:36.384 --> 19:38.420
you know, I can't get my kid
off of his iPad.

19:38.453 --> 19:40.022
Yeah, how is Gazza, by the way?

19:40.056 --> 19:42.058
He's skinny, he hasn't eaten
in a couple of weeks

19:42.091 --> 19:44.994
'cause I haven't sorted out,
um...

19:45.027 --> 19:48.965
- A couple weeks?
- It's my job when, you know,

19:48.998 --> 19:52.869
regular life kicks in
that I take care of paying

19:52.902 --> 19:54.971
all of the food stuff
and we've still got it

19:55.004 --> 19:57.539
set up like that
for some reason.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.008
I mean, if you're kid's starving

19:59.041 --> 20:00.710
I would hope that you would
take care of them instead of

20:00.743 --> 20:02.945
- worrying about this.
- You say that, you say that

20:02.979 --> 20:04.479
but you would actually hope

20:04.513 --> 20:07.984
that his mother, yeah?

20:08.017 --> 20:09.551
The woman that's looking
after him everyday

20:09.585 --> 20:11.520
would have brought
this up sooner.

20:11.553 --> 20:13.022
- Rather than just leaving it...
- Well, have you called her?

20:13.055 --> 20:14.957
You call Mark the bad guy,
Mark's the bad guy.

20:14.991 --> 20:17.059
Yeah, okay, hands up,
I didn't pay.

20:17.093 --> 20:19.561
All right, but everyone else
has got to take

20:19.595 --> 20:21.329
their share of
the responsibility.

20:21.363 --> 20:23.532
I am worried about your kid
but this is not part of

20:23.565 --> 20:25.067
what I need to be
focused on right now.

20:25.101 --> 20:27.737
- This is not my concern.
- Maybe it's a metaphor.

20:27.770 --> 20:32.775
Yeah? For um,
unless we keep topping up

20:32.809 --> 20:37.713
the food vouchers in creativity

20:37.747 --> 20:39.582
uh, then maybe
we need someone else

20:39.615 --> 20:42.384
- to pick up the slack.
- Yeah, so go get my almond milk.

20:42.417 --> 20:43.986
I mean, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.922
Your almond milk is not part
of this transaction.

20:45.955 --> 20:48.724
- I will absolutely do that...
- We're talking about food right?

20:48.758 --> 20:51.694
No, it's a metaphor.

20:53.930 --> 20:58.567
I transferred the money
over to your... the account.

20:58.601 --> 21:05.507
So uh, so it should
all be in there and sorted.

21:05.540 --> 21:08.476
And uh, yeah, so.

21:08.510 --> 21:12.114
So I did it.

21:12.148 --> 21:13.415
Yeah, no, I know.

21:13.448 --> 21:18.988
It's just like, I mean...

21:21.757 --> 21:25.393
I was actually working
through something earlier

21:25.427 --> 21:27.597
if you wanted to hear it.

21:27.630 --> 21:28.831
- Kell?
- Let me just get through this

21:28.865 --> 21:30.933
a couple times, Alice.

21:30.967 --> 21:34.170
♪ And I have all your feelings ♪

21:34.203 --> 21:36.806
- Kell?
- ♪ And I know ♪

21:36.839 --> 21:39.008
Yeah but I was going through
the... I want to do the...

21:39.041 --> 21:41.177
the guitar part, hold on.

21:41.210 --> 21:42.845
Well, I actually wrote this
for you.

21:42.879 --> 21:45.447
So let's just like
run through it.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.782
See how you feel about it.

21:46.816 --> 21:48.618
If you don't like it,
you don't like it.

21:48.651 --> 21:50.853
Right,
I didn't finish playing but.

21:50.887 --> 21:54.556
Okay, well, this is actually
like a finished song, so.

22:10.873 --> 22:13.910
And then a really
simple verse like...

22:13.943 --> 22:17.980
♪ Keep me down here ♪

22:18.014 --> 22:22.752
♪ Don't tell anybody ♪

22:22.785 --> 22:25.788
♪ It's our little secret now ♪

22:30.760 --> 22:34.897

22:34.931 --> 22:37.600

22:46.943 --> 22:50.780
♪ I've been thinking ♪

22:50.813 --> 22:53.649
♪ While you're drinking ♪

22:53.683 --> 22:57.253

22:57.286 --> 22:59.655
♪ About you babe ♪

23:02.658 --> 23:06.561

23:06.595 --> 23:09.031

23:09.065 --> 23:11.100

23:11.133 --> 23:13.135
And then it goes to like
a G just before the chorus.

23:13.169 --> 23:15.137
♪ About you babe ♪

23:15.171 --> 23:17.073
Right, let me just like...
I'm gonna add something to it

23:17.106 --> 23:18.774
'cause that's not...
that's not bad.

23:18.808 --> 23:20.643
Oh okay, well yeah,
let's run through it.

23:20.676 --> 23:24.280
But I still feel like
if it starts...

23:30.319 --> 23:31.620
Hm.

23:31.654 --> 23:33.222
So you think
it should start at that

23:33.255 --> 23:35.291
- and then go into like...
- Well, I just feel like

23:35.324 --> 23:37.525
I like the melody
of this so much.

23:37.559 --> 23:39.895
Yeah, no I totally agree,
we should work this through

23:39.929 --> 23:42.898
but tonight, because we need
to get like one song down,

23:42.932 --> 23:44.600
we should we record
the one that's finished

23:44.633 --> 23:46.534
- and then we can...
- Well, this one's not not

23:46.568 --> 23:48.170
- finished it's just like...
- You haven't got lyrics

23:48.204 --> 23:50.239
though right?
What are the lyrics?

23:50.272 --> 23:51.607
No but I have them written down.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.742
I just... I left my notebook.

23:52.775 --> 23:54.010
I thought we were just doing...

23:54.043 --> 23:56.012
I was just here
to play you my one song.

23:56.045 --> 23:57.780
I didn't know that
there was printer...

23:57.813 --> 23:58.981
'Cause otherwise
I would've printed it out

23:59.015 --> 24:00.116
and handed it out to you guys.

24:00.149 --> 24:01.684
So this definitely got potential

24:01.717 --> 24:03.319
it's just that this
is finished now.

24:03.352 --> 24:04.987
But I feel like this one
we can work on.

24:05.021 --> 24:06.756
- We can add more to it.
- Yeah, completely.

24:06.789 --> 24:07.823
Not that this one's bad.

24:07.857 --> 24:09.692
It's just I feel like...

24:09.725 --> 24:11.827
Like you can bring your notebook
and we can look at the lyrics

24:11.861 --> 24:13.295
- and work them through.
- Yeah, it's just in the

24:13.329 --> 24:14.930
- coach house, I can go get it.
- Okay, go get it

24:14.964 --> 24:17.666
'cause I'd love to hear them.

24:17.700 --> 24:20.136
Yeah, okay.

24:24.974 --> 24:27.276
Do you use sunflower oil
or vegetable oil?

24:27.309 --> 24:30.279
I do sunflower.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.084
There we go.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.187
I totally get
why you're frustrated

24:38.220 --> 24:40.956
and I just don't think
storming off...

24:40.990 --> 24:42.358
I thought I was being fine.

24:42.391 --> 24:43.993
The way that she came out it

24:44.026 --> 24:48.998
when she like pushed me off
of the keyboard.

24:49.031 --> 24:51.000
I mean, she like pushed me off
of it.

24:51.033 --> 24:52.735
Mm, I've said to her,

24:52.768 --> 24:57.206
you know...

24:57.239 --> 24:59.341
I've tried to tell her, "Look,
that's not how we do things."

24:59.375 --> 25:01.210
And this is like,
you've always wrote

25:01.243 --> 25:03.012
and I said,
"You know, if it's not broke,

25:03.045 --> 25:04.880
you know, there's no need
to fix it."

25:04.914 --> 25:07.049
We were easing around each
other, you know what I mean?

25:07.083 --> 25:12.321
There was like communication
and not it's like, I don't even.

25:12.354 --> 25:13.889
She feels like a stranger.

25:13.923 --> 25:15.291
Like every time I see her
in the morning like

25:15.324 --> 25:17.726
when we're getting coffee,
I'm like, "Hey."

25:17.760 --> 25:19.061
And then she says
"Hey" and disappears.

25:19.095 --> 25:20.696
But then the... She was like
talking to me like

25:20.729 --> 25:22.798
I'm a fucking A&R person
all of a sudden.

25:22.832 --> 25:24.834
She probably feels
the stress as well though.

25:24.867 --> 25:26.001
Like, we're all under it.

25:26.035 --> 25:28.104
I mean, the first album,
that was just,

25:28.137 --> 25:29.972
you know, it was fun,
we all enjoyed ourselves.

25:30.005 --> 25:31.841
Yeah, this one needs
to feel fun.

25:31.874 --> 25:34.210
That's the only way you can tell
if the energy's good or not.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.212
Based off of how we're
vibing with each other.

25:36.245 --> 25:38.047
But I can't fake it with her.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.249
I can't just like pretend
like it's totally normal

25:40.282 --> 25:43.285
to...

25:43.319 --> 25:46.288
to just like say
whatever she wants.

25:46.322 --> 25:47.957
I just don't think it's normal.

25:47.990 --> 25:49.758
I'm like, I don't like
the style of the song.

25:49.792 --> 25:52.995
I don't like anything about it.

25:53.028 --> 25:57.032
So what... In terms
of us progressing then

25:57.066 --> 25:58.667
what do you... what do you
think the next step is?

25:58.701 --> 26:00.336
Because we can't keep
carrying on like this.

26:00.369 --> 26:02.838
I mean, we're all here we've
got to try and resolve this

26:02.872 --> 26:05.007
and I've got your back
100 percent, you know.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.943
I've never stepped
on your toes with that.

26:07.977 --> 26:09.945
Your writing's your domain,
you know.

26:09.979 --> 26:11.347
You're one of... honestly,
you're one of

26:11.380 --> 26:13.215
the most talented
writers I know.

26:13.249 --> 26:15.117
Psh.

26:15.151 --> 26:16.819
Don't say that,
I would not bullshit you.

26:16.852 --> 26:18.320
All right.

26:18.354 --> 26:21.223
I just... I want to be in
the right space for it to come.

26:21.257 --> 26:24.293
You know? I feel like I'm
processing a bunch of things.

26:24.326 --> 26:26.729
And I'm just having
to let them come through me

26:26.762 --> 26:29.999
in order to speak
and to be like open to it.

26:30.032 --> 26:32.234
'Cause otherwise it's false

26:32.268 --> 26:34.737
and I don't want it to sound
like some other record,

26:34.770 --> 26:36.438
- you know and just some like...
- You want to play the truth.

26:36.472 --> 26:39.008
Yeah, I want it to be the truth
of like, even part of this,

26:39.041 --> 26:40.709
feeling insecure,
I'm like I want to put that

26:40.743 --> 26:42.945
into the record, a lot of
artists feel that was obviously.

26:42.978 --> 26:44.413
You know, it's like that's
all part of the process.

26:44.446 --> 26:46.148
I want that to come across.

26:46.182 --> 26:47.816
I just thought it would be nice
to get us together

26:47.850 --> 26:49.752
and kind of like hash
some ideas out

26:49.785 --> 26:51.453
but you know, she has
to realize yours is still

26:51.487 --> 26:53.255
a work in progress,
she can't just kick yours out

26:53.289 --> 26:55.958
- of the way as well.
- I think if we go in as a team

26:55.991 --> 26:59.028
and we're like,
"Hey, these are my songs,

26:59.061 --> 27:03.365
you know, our songs
and you can like..."

27:03.399 --> 27:06.101
She can add her own guitar riffs
if she wants to.

27:06.135 --> 27:08.103
- Yeah.
- But like, let's start with

27:08.137 --> 27:10.839
- our songs, you know.
- Uh-huh.

27:10.873 --> 27:13.943
- And then we'll go from there.
- Yeah.

27:13.976 --> 27:16.145
And then maybe at the end
once we get ours done

27:16.178 --> 27:21.417
then she can, you know,
record one of her songs.

27:23.819 --> 27:26.255
Able get internet
in your room?

27:26.288 --> 27:29.258
No.

27:29.291 --> 27:30.926
Shit.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.461
I just need to find something
to fucking masturbate to,

27:32.494 --> 27:34.396
you know what I mean?

27:34.430 --> 27:37.766
I can't relax at night.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.468
- This isn't even cooked.
- Is it not?

27:39.501 --> 27:41.904
Hazel?

27:55.317 --> 27:58.287
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.189
- Hey, morning.
- Hey, Dean.

28:00.222 --> 28:01.257
Good morning.

28:05.527 --> 28:07.296
So this is it
and this is our studio.

28:09.265 --> 28:10.499
Are you a professional
photographer?

28:10.532 --> 28:12.301
- He shot for Vogue.
- He is legit.

28:12.334 --> 28:13.902
He's as good as we can afford.

28:13.936 --> 28:16.372
Oh my god.

28:16.405 --> 28:21.243
I don't like this guy
but he has a camera.

28:21.277 --> 28:23.245
He wants us to roll
under a fence

28:23.279 --> 28:26.548
in the pile of shit
and stand on an iconic hill.

28:26.583 --> 28:28.083
Can we get these photos
over here?

28:28.117 --> 28:29.451
The wall's nice, all right.

28:29.485 --> 28:31.420
He called me "Doll" "My Doll."

29:49.965 --> 29:52.067
Hey, Joe,
what's seems to be going on?

29:52.101 --> 29:53.936
How long have you guys been
in here? Do you know how long

29:53.969 --> 29:55.672
- they've been in here?
- I don't know I just came in

29:55.705 --> 29:58.574
- and then I came to get you.
- Oh that's all right, isn't it.

29:58.608 --> 30:00.242
What's going on?

30:00.275 --> 30:01.944
She's recording a song
without us.

30:01.977 --> 30:05.013
She's recording... she's...

30:05.047 --> 30:07.116
Are you kidding me?

30:07.149 --> 30:08.984
This isn't a fucking
Alice record.

30:09.017 --> 30:11.053
What is she doing? She can't
come in here without us.

30:17.159 --> 30:18.193
Hey.

30:18.227 --> 30:20.429
♪ How can I like you.. ♪

30:20.462 --> 30:23.666
Hi, what's going on?

30:23.700 --> 30:26.001
- Uh, hey.
- Hi, what's up?

30:26.034 --> 30:27.302
Yeah, we're just putting down
this track

30:27.336 --> 30:29.004
'cause like we've got
the whole day.

30:29.037 --> 30:31.206
- Right for what?
- Just 'cause it's like finished

30:31.240 --> 30:33.242
and it sounds kind of
like polished.

30:33.275 --> 30:35.043
Why didn't you tell us you were
going to be in here though?

30:35.077 --> 30:37.112
It's 'cause you guys were busy,
you were like having breakfast

30:37.146 --> 30:39.148
and stuff and it's been
three weeks now.

30:39.181 --> 30:41.183
It's like, we're nearing
the end of our time

30:41.216 --> 30:43.085
and I thought we've at least
got one finished song.

30:43.118 --> 30:45.120
- But I feel a little...
- I mean, have you...

30:45.154 --> 30:46.589
Let me finish...
I just feel a little like

30:46.623 --> 30:49.024
you went behind my back
by coming in here

30:49.057 --> 30:51.728
recoding without us
because we are all here

30:51.761 --> 30:53.529
and we all could have been
apart of it

30:53.562 --> 30:55.264
but instead you decide
to go ahead.

30:55.297 --> 30:56.999
No, I really...
I'm so sorry if you think

30:57.032 --> 30:58.701
it was behind your back,
it was just that I felt

30:58.735 --> 31:01.704
we had the time, I got up early
to like, to finish something

31:01.738 --> 31:04.573
to play it to you, it was never
gonna go anywhere obviously.

31:04.607 --> 31:06.275
It wasn't going to make it
on the record

31:06.308 --> 31:08.076
- unless you heard it...
- So why record it?

31:08.110 --> 31:09.545
- I don't understand.
- I mean, you haven't written

31:09.579 --> 31:12.214
- a full song.
- We were actually finishing

31:12.247 --> 31:14.016
breakfast this morning we were
wondering where you were

31:14.049 --> 31:16.586
because we just...
we're breaking down a song.

31:16.619 --> 31:19.555
Play it please, I genuinely
would really like to hear it.

31:19.589 --> 31:22.324
That's not a challenge,
I actually really

31:22.357 --> 31:25.160
- would like to hear it.
- No.

31:25.194 --> 31:28.163
- It'd be great.
- Okay.

31:28.197 --> 31:29.331
Kelly, where are you going?

31:29.364 --> 31:31.601
Just one second.

31:31.634 --> 31:33.302
- There.
- You just deleted everything

31:33.335 --> 31:34.604
that we've been working on
all day?

31:34.637 --> 31:36.205
We need to save room for when

31:36.238 --> 31:38.106
we're actually recording
together.

31:38.140 --> 31:41.276
Kell, maybe um, we should just...

31:41.310 --> 31:44.513
What?

31:44.546 --> 31:46.415
Oh.

31:46.448 --> 31:49.418
- I mean...
- She's manipulated all of you.

31:49.451 --> 31:54.289
But you know... Okay,
that she spend all... all...

31:54.323 --> 31:57.092
Oh, she spend all morning on it.
What have we been doing

31:57.125 --> 31:59.261
all morning? We were all
talking, we were communication.

31:59.294 --> 32:01.598
We were working together and she
comes in here behind our back.

32:01.631 --> 32:04.399
Mhm, mhm, mhm, yes.

32:04.433 --> 32:07.169
- No, I see, yes.
- Yes you see?

32:07.202 --> 32:08.605
I don't understand.
Who's side are you on?

32:08.638 --> 32:11.206
Did you know about this?
Did you know about this?

32:11.240 --> 32:12.642
I did not know about this.
I was in...

32:12.675 --> 32:15.077
I was in the other room
with you talking

32:15.110 --> 32:16.646
- to you about...
- Were you distracting us

32:16.679 --> 32:20.583
knowing that this was happening?

32:20.617 --> 32:23.185
I can't work like this.
I don't want her coming back.

32:23.218 --> 32:25.722
I don't want her
in the band anymore.

32:25.755 --> 32:27.724
This is complete betrayal.

32:27.757 --> 32:29.525
How are we supposed
to make anything

32:29.558 --> 32:33.395
if we can't trust each other?

32:33.428 --> 32:34.563
- Sure.
- This should definitely be

32:34.597 --> 32:36.164
a conversation to be had here.

32:36.198 --> 32:37.700
I mean, we can't just
kick a member out.

32:37.734 --> 32:40.102
I mean, Alice... I've got
loyalties to Alice as well.

32:40.135 --> 32:42.237
I totally get you and
I understand we should be...

32:42.271 --> 32:43.840
Loyalties to her for what?

32:43.873 --> 32:46.141
I mean, she wrote one song,
nobody likes it.

32:46.174 --> 32:47.509
I don't understand
why we're recording it.

32:47.543 --> 32:50.580
Okay, um.

32:50.613 --> 32:52.447
Well, I think I should go
and talk to...

32:52.481 --> 32:54.483
I think I should go and...

32:54.516 --> 32:56.251
Go nurture her and kiss her
and be like,

32:56.285 --> 32:57.654
"Sorry, baby,
everything's gonna be okay."

32:57.687 --> 32:59.656
- It's my job.
- Okay, go, go, go.

32:59.689 --> 33:01.724
Go.

33:01.758 --> 33:05.427
If you don't stay
and handle this

33:05.460 --> 33:06.461
you're in trouble.

33:06.495 --> 33:08.598
But go talk to her.

33:08.631 --> 33:11.333
Go.

33:22.879 --> 33:26.248
Hi, yeah, hello.

33:26.281 --> 33:28.751
Hi, yeah,
I can't talk right now.

33:28.785 --> 33:33.488
I'm just in... in... in
a slightly hostile environment

33:33.522 --> 33:35.792
and um...

33:35.825 --> 33:38.795
I'm just uh, yeah.

33:38.828 --> 33:40.529
Really?

33:40.562 --> 33:44.166
Oh well, we can all relax
a little bit, can't we?

33:44.199 --> 33:45.300
Good.

33:45.334 --> 33:46.803
Good, oh no the girls will be...

33:46.836 --> 33:48.303
the girls will be happy.

33:48.337 --> 33:52.875
How's... how's... how's Gazza?

34:12.393 --> 34:15.429
Thank you very much.

34:18.701 --> 34:22.938
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:59.909 --> 35:03.846
We found him.

35:03.880 --> 35:04.914
Hello.

35:04.947 --> 35:06.683
Oh.

35:06.716 --> 35:08.751
Youi had the same idea, huh?

35:11.654 --> 35:13.221
Scooch over.

35:13.255 --> 35:14.691
Mind if I?

35:14.724 --> 35:15.958
Hey.

35:15.992 --> 35:19.394
Small town, isn't it?

35:19.428 --> 35:20.897
- Who wants a drink?
- Yes.

35:20.930 --> 35:22.732
Yeah, okay cool.

35:22.765 --> 35:24.232
Cheers.

35:24.266 --> 35:26.568
- Oh.
<i>- Sláinte.</i>

35:27.970 --> 35:30.405
You know, that came from
that eye contact thing?

35:30.439 --> 35:32.441
- No.
- The romans used to

35:32.474 --> 35:33.976
make eye contact
when they were cheersing

35:34.010 --> 35:35.978
'cause it meant,
"I haven't poisoned you.

35:36.012 --> 35:40.449
You haven't poisoned me."

35:40.482 --> 35:42.250
Well, in that case,
let's cheers again.

35:45.688 --> 35:47.724
Oh!

36:09.912 --> 36:11.279
Isn't it?

36:11.313 --> 36:12.715
If we like, you know,

36:12.749 --> 36:14.984
everyone's like
enjoying themselves

36:15.017 --> 36:16.786
and everyone's in sync, yeah?

36:16.819 --> 36:18.654
- Yeah.
- I'll... I'll get in contact

36:18.688 --> 36:23.325
with the label and see if
we can break for Christmas.

36:23.358 --> 36:24.761
Yay.

36:24.794 --> 36:28.530
- This is nice.
- Yeah, Christmas.

36:28.563 --> 36:31.901
See? Everyone's getting along.

36:33.535 --> 36:35.437
Hello, Jamie.

36:35.470 --> 36:36.639
Hello.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.708
So tell me, how's it going?

36:38.741 --> 36:40.843
Yeah, honestly, it's going...

36:40.877 --> 36:44.312
it's going better
than I could've imagined.

36:44.346 --> 36:46.749
What about the band? What about
the tracks you promised?

36:46.783 --> 36:49.484
Kelly is, you know,
very protective of the material

36:49.518 --> 36:52.822
of her, you know,
and she's accumulating

36:52.855 --> 36:55.925
that material is gathering
together like a snowball

36:55.958 --> 36:58.694
down a mountain
and really excited about it

36:58.728 --> 37:01.898
and uh, I think we're nearly
ready to record.

37:01.931 --> 37:03.633
Say that again?

37:03.666 --> 37:05.868
Mark, let me fucking stop you
there.

37:05.902 --> 37:07.335
- Okay.
- You've been there for fucking

37:07.369 --> 37:09.371
- three weeks, pal.
- Yes.

37:09.404 --> 37:11.674
And you've come up buckle.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.609
I want two tracks in two days.

37:13.643 --> 37:14.977
Can you fucking deliver?

37:15.011 --> 37:18.014
Right. Yes.

37:18.047 --> 37:23.518
And then everything is cock up,
okay.

37:23.552 --> 37:30.458
He's fucking mental.

37:30.492 --> 37:33.863
Ah.

37:33.896 --> 37:37.532
How are you, Mark?

37:37.566 --> 37:41.003
Um.

37:41.037 --> 37:45.440
If I don't send something
to the label pretty soon

37:45.473 --> 37:46.876
Jamie's gonna come here

37:46.909 --> 37:50.512
and he's gonna shut down
the recording session.

37:50.545 --> 37:52.682
He's gonna shut down the band.

37:52.715 --> 37:55.017
He's gonna physically
shut me down.

37:55.051 --> 37:59.055
He's gonna fold me in half
like a fucking laptop.

37:59.088 --> 38:02.390
I can't really imagine

38:02.424 --> 38:06.996
what life without this
would be like now.

38:13.870 --> 38:17.106
And then the first verse is like

38:17.139 --> 38:21.409
♪ Keep me down there ♪

38:21.443 --> 38:25.815
♪ Don't tell anybody ♪

38:25.848 --> 38:29.085
♪ It's our little secret now ♪

38:33.856 --> 38:38.027
♪ Hold me now ♪

38:38.060 --> 38:40.663
♪ Don't love anybody ♪

38:42.732 --> 38:46.802
♪ So hard to love you now ♪

38:46.836 --> 38:50.438
And then the bridge
is kind of like C.

38:50.472 --> 38:54.110
♪ I'll be thinking ♪

38:54.143 --> 38:57.880
♪ While I'm drinking about you ♪

38:57.914 --> 38:59.982
Bye.

39:00.016 --> 39:01.549
Happy New Year, Mark.

39:01.584 --> 39:02.985
Merry Christmas,
whatever you celebrate.

39:03.019 --> 39:04.486
Merry Christmas.

39:04.519 --> 39:05.855
Have fun.

39:05.888 --> 39:08.456
- Oh, you bet I will.
- Don't forget to

39:08.490 --> 39:11.027
have a... have a break,
a proper break.

39:11.060 --> 39:12.194
- Yeah.
- Bye, Mark.

39:12.228 --> 39:14.931
Bye, Hazel. Do you want a lift?

39:14.964 --> 39:18.034
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Let's do that, all right.

39:18.067 --> 39:21.804
Mark, don't scratch it.

39:21.837 --> 39:24.106
There, it's in.

40:49.625 --> 40:53.095
Hello?

40:53.129 --> 40:54.797
- That's nice.
- What did you get up to?

40:54.830 --> 40:56.999
I just kind of
isolated myself honestly

40:57.033 --> 41:00.803
and just stayed in,
you know, didn't drink.

41:00.836 --> 41:02.238
- No?
- No, just trying to like

41:02.271 --> 41:05.274
take care of myself,
clear the mind, clear the body.

41:05.307 --> 41:06.776
- You know.
- Yup, go all Zen.

41:06.809 --> 41:08.711
- Clean my room.
- Clean my room.

41:08.744 --> 41:10.579
So it was good,
I think it helped a lot.

41:10.613 --> 41:12.348
I got a lot down.

41:15.284 --> 41:17.253
Well, no that's great news,
I'll talk to her.

41:19.755 --> 41:23.092
Yeah, well, I'll let her know.

41:23.125 --> 41:24.960
Okay, that's great.

41:24.994 --> 41:26.595
No, thank you.

41:26.629 --> 41:28.697
Thank you, good to...

41:28.731 --> 41:29.732
good to hear.

41:29.765 --> 41:31.801
Thank you, goodbye, goodbye.

41:31.834 --> 41:33.069
Hello.

41:33.102 --> 41:34.370
Hello, Happy New Year.

41:34.403 --> 41:35.805
Happy New Year.

41:35.838 --> 41:37.840
- How are you?
- I'm good.

41:37.873 --> 41:41.077
- Did you have a nice rest?
- I did, yeah.

41:41.110 --> 41:42.378
How are you feeling?

41:42.411 --> 41:45.081
I'm feeling full
of all of the food.

41:45.114 --> 41:48.017
Yes, that's good.

41:48.050 --> 41:49.618
Here's a bit of um...

41:49.652 --> 41:53.089
here's a bit of
late Christmas news.

41:53.122 --> 41:54.757
I just feel for him sometimes.

41:54.790 --> 41:57.393
I feel like he... yeah,
I think he misses his kid

41:57.426 --> 42:00.362
- and he's struggling with that.
- I mean, but you know,

42:00.396 --> 42:03.766
it's not about, like I'm sorry
but he has a job to do.

42:03.799 --> 42:05.167
It's like I like Mark too.

42:05.201 --> 42:06.869
I love Mark but at the same time

42:06.902 --> 42:08.838
I'm like don't take it
personally.

42:08.871 --> 42:10.639
You know, I mean
the guy's gonna have a ulcer.

42:10.673 --> 42:12.875
I feel like every time I talk
to him with a raised voice

42:12.908 --> 42:14.143
he's about to break into tears.

42:14.176 --> 42:15.811
I'm like, this ain't about you,
dude.

42:15.845 --> 42:17.113
I'm not upset with you
as a person

42:17.146 --> 42:18.347
I just want you to get
the job done, you know.

42:18.380 --> 42:19.849
Yeah, exactly,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:19.882 --> 42:21.383
And he just doesn't know
how to mix the two.

42:21.417 --> 42:25.221
No wait, so you want my songs?
But you want me out?

42:25.254 --> 42:27.823
So you want to put
Kelly's name on my fucking song?

42:27.857 --> 42:29.425
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No, that's crazy.

42:29.458 --> 42:31.293
- You're misunderstanding me.
- Please explain it better.

42:31.327 --> 42:33.395
- Hey.
- Um, um, hello.

42:33.429 --> 42:35.764
- What's up? Hey.
- Hello, hello. Happy New Year.

42:35.798 --> 42:37.433
- Happy New Year.
- Hey!

42:37.466 --> 42:39.368
Did you know about this?
Did you know about this?

42:39.401 --> 42:41.370
We don't need to talk about...

42:41.403 --> 42:43.806
We should finish off talking
about it in private before...

42:43.839 --> 42:45.274
Well, the label want
me out of the band

42:45.307 --> 42:47.309
but they want you
to record my songs.

42:47.343 --> 42:50.079
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Because last I heard

42:50.112 --> 42:52.882
is that you didn't want
to hear my songs at all.

42:52.915 --> 42:54.383
- Well, I think that...
- I don't understand

42:54.416 --> 42:56.051
what we're talking about,
I don't know anything

42:56.085 --> 42:57.119
- you're talking about.
- We're slightly cross

42:57.153 --> 42:59.421
purposes, okay.

42:59.455 --> 43:01.857
Well, it's new...
it's new information.

43:01.891 --> 43:03.392
Three minutes
before you got here

43:03.425 --> 43:04.894
and I came off the phone
with the label

43:04.927 --> 43:08.197
and um, um.

43:08.230 --> 43:10.866
Before Christmas, um...

43:10.900 --> 43:12.334
the label, they were going
to shut us down.

43:12.368 --> 43:14.904
I had to give them
something in good faith

43:14.937 --> 43:16.805
so they knew
that we were working...

43:16.839 --> 43:18.941
I didn't know about this,
this wasn't my thing.

43:18.974 --> 43:20.709
Alice didn't know about this

43:20.743 --> 43:24.880
but I recorded
some of her stuff.

43:24.914 --> 43:27.116
- Just rough demos.
- She didn't know that

43:27.149 --> 43:28.851
it was happening,
I made the decision.

43:28.884 --> 43:31.820
I made the decision
and I sent the stuff off.

43:31.854 --> 43:33.889
- They love your tracks.
- That doesn't matter

43:33.923 --> 43:35.858
because Kelly hates the songs.

43:35.891 --> 43:37.293
I never said I hated the songs.

43:37.326 --> 43:39.495
I just wanted to work
on other stuff.

43:39.528 --> 43:41.797
That's where we get
to you leaving the band.

43:41.830 --> 43:45.935
They want to offer you
a solo recording contract.

43:45.968 --> 43:48.804
They want to offer you a deal

43:48.837 --> 43:51.373
which would mean that
you would leave Glass Heart

43:51.407 --> 43:54.043
and we'd find a replacement.

43:54.076 --> 43:57.112
We'd bring in
a session musician, the best.

43:57.146 --> 43:58.380
You're gonna bring in a
stranger?

43:58.414 --> 44:00.482
- Well, yeah.
- To replace Alice.

44:00.516 --> 44:03.285
Or anyone that you want.
You would be auditioning them.

44:03.319 --> 44:06.288
You'd get a say in it
and it could be someone you know

44:06.322 --> 44:09.358
or someone that you didn't know
or anyone you want, you know.

44:09.391 --> 44:10.826
I mean, I'm getting
nothing out of it.

44:10.859 --> 44:12.761
- There's nothing...
- How do you guys

44:12.795 --> 44:14.530
feel about this, I mean?

44:14.563 --> 44:17.266
I don't...

44:23.372 --> 44:28.010
Look.

44:28.043 --> 44:30.312
This is your choice, Alice,
this is something that you

44:30.346 --> 44:33.816
decide at the end of the day.
If you wanted to stay with us

44:33.849 --> 44:37.353
then you can,
I... I want you to realize

44:37.386 --> 44:38.988
that this is a big opportunity.

44:39.021 --> 44:40.222
I don't want you
to look back and be like,

44:40.256 --> 44:43.025
"That's what
I could've had my shot."

44:43.058 --> 44:45.794
You know and we held you back.

44:45.828 --> 44:48.430
I don't want you to feel that.

44:48.464 --> 44:52.301
You know, and we're going
to miss you obviously.

44:52.334 --> 44:54.570
- Jess?
- As an artist I totally

44:54.604 --> 44:58.207
understand whatever you want
to do, I get that but...

44:58.240 --> 45:02.911
there's a part of me
that feels like it's a divorce.

45:02.945 --> 45:06.415
Doesn't feel the same with
a total stranger stepping in.

45:06.448 --> 45:09.118
But I get it, you know.

45:09.151 --> 45:13.255
Well, hopefully you know, if we
all get our records finished

45:13.289 --> 45:16.859
there won't be a divorce.

45:20.095 --> 45:23.966
So that's a... we all win.

45:35.210 --> 45:37.346
Alice was the first person
I saw and I thought

45:37.379 --> 45:41.083
that probably the best way
to talk to you all about it

45:41.116 --> 45:43.118
it would be to find out

45:43.152 --> 45:45.454
where she stood
on the whole situation

45:45.487 --> 45:47.156
about leaving the band first.

45:47.189 --> 45:49.992
But in my... in my defense,

45:50.025 --> 45:51.994
they needed to hear something
in order to give us

45:52.027 --> 45:54.997
some more money
and in me doing that,

45:55.030 --> 45:56.965
it could potentially
be a good thing.

45:56.999 --> 46:00.269
You know, if gives you
the freedom and the brain space

46:00.302 --> 46:02.271
in order to kind of be creative

46:02.304 --> 46:04.273
and to make the album
that you want to make

46:04.306 --> 46:07.543
and um I... in the long run,

46:07.576 --> 46:10.879
maybe one day you can see
it in your heart to...

46:10.913 --> 46:13.282
All right, Mark.

46:13.315 --> 46:16.518
It's okay, all right.

46:19.589 --> 46:22.659
Obviously I didn't appreciate

46:22.692 --> 46:25.494
you sending
someone else's music.

46:25.527 --> 46:29.599
I don't ever, ever want you

46:29.632 --> 46:34.970
going behind my back again
to my label.

46:35.003 --> 46:38.507
But that being said,

46:38.540 --> 46:41.944
I do...

46:41.977 --> 46:45.080
think this is a blessing
in disguise.

46:45.114 --> 46:47.015
Obviously the reason
why we had to take a break

46:47.049 --> 46:49.586
was because Alice and I
were budding heads so much

46:49.619 --> 46:53.455
and not getting
any work done and...

46:53.489 --> 46:55.424
I really want what's best
for her, you know.

46:55.457 --> 46:59.294
And if the label, you know,
sees value in her songs

46:59.328 --> 47:00.929
then that's up to them.

47:00.963 --> 47:02.364
So.

47:02.398 --> 47:05.334
I say she moves forward

47:05.367 --> 47:08.937
and Glass Heart
goes its own direction.

47:08.971 --> 47:10.005
- Yeah.
- It happens to bands

47:10.038 --> 47:12.174
- all the time.
- Y... yeah.

47:12.207 --> 47:14.243
They lose members, I mean
there was a fifth Beatle

47:14.276 --> 47:17.546
for God's sake, so
it's like let's let that die

47:17.580 --> 47:21.016
and let's keep going.

47:21.049 --> 47:24.687
Now you're free to make
the album that you want to make.

47:24.721 --> 47:27.189
Do what I want yeah,
any old time.

47:27.222 --> 47:30.727
And... and I feel like
I've cleared a path for you...

47:30.760 --> 47:31.895
Okay, well, let's not take
too much credit

47:31.927 --> 47:37.266
but yes, things are okay.
They're going to be okay.

47:37.299 --> 47:38.967
We only have
a couple weeks here.

47:39.001 --> 47:40.402
I really want to enjoy it,
you know.

47:40.436 --> 47:42.571
I feel like last time
I wasn't appreciating

47:42.605 --> 47:44.506
what it meant to be out here.

47:44.540 --> 47:46.341
What it meant to be able
to make a record

47:46.375 --> 47:48.243
and that's what I want.

47:48.277 --> 47:50.145
- Uh, yeah.
- You know?

47:50.179 --> 47:52.381
We're the luck ones who get
to do this for a living.

47:52.414 --> 47:55.585
So I want to feel
like we're reconnecting

47:55.618 --> 47:58.320
not only as professional

47:58.353 --> 48:00.489
but also as friends.

48:00.522 --> 48:02.659
Okay.

48:02.692 --> 48:03.726
There it is.

48:03.760 --> 48:04.727
See?

48:06.028 --> 48:07.429
Yeah.

48:07.463 --> 48:09.264
It's gonna be okay.

48:09.298 --> 48:10.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:10.633 --> 48:13.068
Cool, yeah, I'm feelin' comfy.

48:13.101 --> 48:14.102
Feelin' better, right?

48:14.136 --> 48:15.270
Yeah, I'm more relaxed.

48:15.304 --> 48:17.005
- Good.
- Yeah.

48:17.039 --> 48:18.574
I feel like some tea.

48:18.608 --> 48:20.075
- Yeah.
- You want some?

48:22.244 --> 48:23.245
Yeah.

48:23.278 --> 48:25.280
Yeah, y-yeah, please.

48:25.314 --> 48:27.249
Guess what I found
in the fridge?

48:28.350 --> 48:30.185
- Almond milk.
- Yeah.

48:30.219 --> 48:31.520
- Means the world to me.
- Y-yeah.

48:31.553 --> 48:33.121
- Makes all the difference.
- I know.

48:33.155 --> 48:34.122
- You know?
- I know.

48:34.156 --> 48:35.758
- It's gonna be great.
- Yeah.

48:36.659 --> 48:38.160
I appreciate you.

48:38.193 --> 48:40.663
I appreciate the milk
and I appreciate you.

48:40.697 --> 48:42.030
You want sugar?

48:42.064 --> 48:43.398
- Uh, no thanks.
- No.

48:43.432 --> 48:45.067
No more sugar,
for either of us, right?

48:45.100 --> 48:46.603
I've had enough.

48:51.206 --> 48:52.709
Who the fuck was that?

48:55.410 --> 48:58.180
There's this place
and I've been wandering a bit

48:58.213 --> 48:59.548
trying to find this place
called Rockfield.

48:59.582 --> 49:01.183
Rockfield.
Oh, no way.

49:01.216 --> 49:04.119
That... Rockfields is like
a mile and a half out of town

49:04.152 --> 49:06.656
and that's where I'm recording
an album at the moment.

49:06.689 --> 49:09.424
Oh, well, shit,
here you are.

49:09.458 --> 49:10.492
I've been trying to find it.

49:10.526 --> 49:11.628
I play the guitar.

49:11.661 --> 49:14.196
I'm gonna play with this band
called Glass Heart.

49:14.229 --> 49:15.163
Sorry?

49:15.197 --> 49:16.766
Yeah, there's this band
called Glass Heart.

49:16.799 --> 49:17.901
I don't know if you guys
know them here.

49:17.934 --> 49:20.770
That's the... that's the band
that I'm... that...

49:20.803 --> 49:22.404
I'm playing bass for them
at the moment.

49:22.437 --> 49:24.439
Didn't they tell you guys
that they were gonna...

49:24.473 --> 49:26.408
I think I'm filling in
for another girl.

49:28.243 --> 49:29.612
- So I press the button.
- Mm-hm.

49:29.646 --> 49:31.079
- I hold it down.
- Mm-hm.

49:31.113 --> 49:32.514
And then I press connect
and it doesn't happen.

49:32.548 --> 49:33.515
Mm-hm.

49:34.751 --> 49:37.654
Can you do anything
about this?

49:37.687 --> 49:38.721
- No.
- No.

49:38.755 --> 49:40.289
- No.
- That's it, just failure.

49:40.322 --> 49:43.191
I'm not... I'm not
technologically...

49:43.225 --> 49:45.695
- You didn't even try.
- ...able.

49:45.728 --> 49:48.163
I'm, uh, I'm more like
an analog man.

49:48.196 --> 49:49.164
Mm-hm.

49:49.197 --> 49:50.265
What is that?

49:50.299 --> 49:51.834
Just a butter cheese
sandwich, huh?

49:51.868 --> 49:54.102
You're not even toasting
the bread.

49:54.136 --> 49:55.237
It's a sandwich.

49:55.270 --> 49:56.572
- But...
- Bread, butter.

49:56.606 --> 49:58.373
- You don't want to toast it?
- Cheese.

49:58.407 --> 49:59.609
Well, no, that would be
a toasted sandwich.

49:59.642 --> 50:00.777
That's a different genre.

50:00.810 --> 50:02.645
Why don't you put
some protein on it?

50:02.679 --> 50:04.581
A lettuce?
A tomato?

50:04.614 --> 50:05.514
That's a different meal.

50:05.547 --> 50:07.482
But... I know but I want you
to be healthy

50:07.516 --> 50:08.517
so you live longer.

50:08.550 --> 50:10.452
Do you want me
to live longer?

50:10.485 --> 50:13.488
I started doing this more
of like a raw diet recently,

50:13.522 --> 50:15.123
and it really changes
the way you think.

50:15.157 --> 50:16.325
Hey.

50:16.358 --> 50:17.594
Hey, Mark, this is Patricia.

50:17.627 --> 50:18.895
Hey, guys.

50:18.928 --> 50:20.763
- Can you help me...
- Hey, I got it working.

50:20.797 --> 50:23.365
It's so cold,
I'm not used to it.

50:23.398 --> 50:25.267
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:25.300 --> 50:26.535
Uh, Mark, right?

50:26.568 --> 50:28.270
I'm Mark.
You're... you're Patricia.

50:28.303 --> 50:29.706
- Patricia, yeah.
- You're Patricia.

50:29.739 --> 50:32.274
Yes, Patricia.
Hi, sorry I took so long,

50:32.307 --> 50:34.309
sorry, Hazel,
to get here.

50:34.343 --> 50:36.178
No, you're early
if anything.

50:36.211 --> 50:37.747
- You... you...
- Hi.

50:37.780 --> 50:40.282
- Um...
- I love you Mark.

50:40.315 --> 50:43.151
I've got Utterly Butterly
on my fingers, um,

50:43.185 --> 50:44.353
so I can't.

50:44.386 --> 50:45.788
Uh, not the first time.

50:45.822 --> 50:47.322
Hi.

50:47.356 --> 50:48.357
Um...

50:48.390 --> 50:49.358
Hello.

50:50.192 --> 50:51.594
Mm, hi.

50:52.662 --> 50:53.730
It's so nice to meet you.

50:53.763 --> 50:55.230
- Hi.
- Yeah.

50:55.263 --> 50:56.431
Very friendly.

50:56.465 --> 50:58.735
Sorry, I just like to hug.

50:58.768 --> 51:00.268
- You want some fruit?
- No, I'm good.

51:00.302 --> 51:02.672
- Fruit with your sandwich?
- I'm good, thanks.

51:02.705 --> 51:05.407
I just got a bit lost, uh,
in the town,

51:05.440 --> 51:07.476
and luckily
I bumped into Hazel

51:07.509 --> 51:09.712
and she guided me here.

51:09.746 --> 51:11.313
Yeah, that's good,
it's good.

51:11.346 --> 51:13.616
It's, uh, yeah,
yeah, it's good.

51:13.650 --> 51:14.784
Why are you whispering?

51:14.817 --> 51:17.519
Uh, uh, I don't think...

51:17.552 --> 51:18.688
Yeah.

51:18.721 --> 51:21.356
Uh, it's just there's a lot
of talking and, uh,

51:21.390 --> 51:25.193
it's just nice to sort of give
your voice a bit of a rest,

51:25.227 --> 51:26.829
- I suppose.
- Yeah.

51:26.863 --> 51:28.798
Honestly, I'm so grateful
that you, like,

51:28.831 --> 51:31.400
took your time to call Dean
and make it work.

51:31.433 --> 51:33.603
I really wanted
to get a chance to, like,

51:33.636 --> 51:34.971
- come and jam with the girls.
- Well, that's good.

51:35.004 --> 51:36.939
Do you want a tea
or anything?

51:36.973 --> 51:40.208
Um, yeah, tea would be
incredible, thank you.

51:40.242 --> 51:42.779
How long, uh, how long are you...
are you here for?

51:42.812 --> 51:44.580
Yeah, I, uh,
I don't know, Mark,

51:44.614 --> 51:46.348
how long am I staying here?

51:46.381 --> 51:48.951
- Um, uh...
- Why would he know?

51:48.985 --> 51:50.185
Who are you...
who are you playing with?

51:50.218 --> 51:51.286
We thought... I thought we had
the whole studio to ourselves

51:51.319 --> 51:53.890
for the next three weeks,
but they always bring in

51:53.923 --> 51:55.692
- people to...
- Oh, yeah, well,

51:55.725 --> 51:58.326
Mark spoke to Dean yesterday,
I think,

51:58.360 --> 52:00.262
and he just called me
and I'm gonna be here

52:00.295 --> 52:01.964
until you guys, I guess,
finish 'cause we're gonna

52:01.998 --> 52:03.833
- do the music together.
- There's another one.

52:03.866 --> 52:05.668
So you guys, I don't know
who you're playing with,

52:05.702 --> 52:07.737
but you can play over there
when we have time.

52:07.770 --> 52:10.006
It's so funny,
I'm playing with you guys.

52:11.741 --> 52:13.810
You're playing with us guys?

52:13.843 --> 52:15.343
You're playing
with Glass Heart?

52:15.377 --> 52:16.378
Yeah, I play the guitar.

52:16.411 --> 52:18.380
Yeah, this is Patricia.

52:18.413 --> 52:19.849
She's, um...

52:19.882 --> 52:22.317
You can call me Pat,
by the way.

52:22.350 --> 52:23.285
Huh.

52:23.318 --> 52:25.320
Yeah, I'm so sorry,
you looked at like...

52:25.353 --> 52:27.790
No, I just...
we didn't know that.

52:27.824 --> 52:29.357
Did we, Mark?
Did we know this?

52:29.391 --> 52:30.258
- Um...
- I know,

52:30.292 --> 52:33.261
it was just all
honestly coincidence.

52:33.295 --> 52:35.497
Luckily I was in London
with my husband and...

52:35.530 --> 52:36.498
- Yeah.
- Luckily.

52:36.531 --> 52:37.499
Yeah.

52:39.035 --> 52:40.737
- Well.
- So it's cool.

52:40.770 --> 52:42.471
Yeah, so it's all
like rolling news.

52:42.504 --> 52:44.506
I mean, there's been a lot
of stuff that's, um...

52:45.373 --> 52:46.943
So, we wasn't...
and we weren't...

52:46.976 --> 52:49.444
I thought you would tell
the bandmates.

52:49.478 --> 52:50.680
This is kind of awkward,
I'm sorry.

52:50.713 --> 52:52.514
I would have thought you would
have told the bandmates too.

52:52.547 --> 52:56.586
I... we just... yeah, well,
I mean, there's just, um,

52:56.619 --> 52:57.987
yeah, right,
you're here now.

52:58.020 --> 53:00.355
That's great, that's great
that you're here.

53:00.388 --> 53:02.491
It's just so quick.

53:02.524 --> 53:04.459
Yeah, it is, um...

53:04.493 --> 53:06.528
You know, our... our band member

53:06.561 --> 53:09.364
of the last couple years
just left this morning,

53:09.397 --> 53:11.801
so we thought we were gonna
have a whole process, right,

53:11.834 --> 53:13.535
that we talked about
about, like,

53:13.568 --> 53:14.804
auditioning and finding
the right person

53:14.837 --> 53:16.338
who fit the band
and all that stuff,

53:16.371 --> 53:18.074
but... but at the same time...

53:18.107 --> 53:19.075
I'm sorry, that sucks.

53:19.108 --> 53:21.844
No, you're here now
and that's kind of

53:21.878 --> 53:22.845
all that matters, I guess.

53:22.879 --> 53:24.614
Yeah, um...

53:24.647 --> 53:27.315
And here's what's, uh,
you've obviously played

53:27.349 --> 53:28.416
with other bands, right?

53:28.450 --> 53:32.420
Yeah, I mean, I've...
I've taken this last year

53:32.454 --> 53:34.891
to just, like,
really find myself.

53:34.924 --> 53:37.727
And I traveled to Africa
and I went to India.

53:37.760 --> 53:40.428
I like to do my own music
and write my own songs

53:40.462 --> 53:42.497
and get in my groove
and do my thing, so,

53:42.531 --> 53:44.000
it's kind of hard
to find people

53:44.033 --> 53:45.935
that can adapt
to my lifestyle, so...

53:45.968 --> 53:47.469
Right, right, yeah.

53:47.502 --> 53:49.471
- Oh, hey, look, here's Jess.
- Hey.

53:49.504 --> 53:51.573
Why don't you meet
our new member of the band?

53:51.607 --> 53:52.942
This is Patricia.

53:52.975 --> 53:54.710
Hi.

53:54.744 --> 53:57.479
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Oh my God, I never know.

53:57.512 --> 53:58.848
Are you... you're Jessica.

53:58.881 --> 54:00.116
Of course.

54:00.149 --> 54:02.084
The girl
with the beautiful face.

54:02.118 --> 54:03.786
You're so beautiful.
No wonder.

54:03.820 --> 54:05.788
Oh, thank you.
It's lovely to meet you.

54:05.822 --> 54:08.991
So, Mark, does this mean
I should prepare the studio

54:09.025 --> 54:10.559
for tomorrow?

54:10.593 --> 54:11.861
- Um...
- I think we need

54:11.894 --> 54:14.396
a little time to get to know
each other first.

54:14.429 --> 54:16.632
- And...
- How long do you need to settle?

54:16.666 --> 54:19.602
Um, I don't know,
maybe, uh...

54:19.635 --> 54:21.137
- I'll show you to your room.
- Yeah, Hazel can help me out,

54:21.170 --> 54:22.004
- right?
- Cool,

54:22.038 --> 54:23.973
and then we can,
you know, get some rest.

54:24.006 --> 54:25.842
We'll have breakfast
and we'll kind of go from there.

54:25.875 --> 54:27.944
- Yeah, bright and early.
- Sure, uh, great.

54:27.977 --> 54:29.377
Jess, so nice to meet you.

54:29.411 --> 54:30.445
Hey, yeah.

54:30.478 --> 54:32.380
Nice to meet you, Patricia.

54:32.414 --> 54:33.448
Yeah.

54:33.481 --> 54:35.517
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.

54:35.550 --> 54:36.953
Goodnight,
it's just left here.

54:36.986 --> 54:37.954
- Left?
- Yeah.

54:37.987 --> 54:39.021
Okay.

54:39.055 --> 54:40.923
- Night, beautiful.
- Night.

54:40.957 --> 54:42.091
Goodnight, you.

54:49.198 --> 54:51.067
Well, that was straightforward.

54:51.100 --> 54:54.604
Seems to have worked out
all right.

55:02.745 --> 55:03.713
Hello.

55:04.947 --> 55:06.514
Hello.

55:06.548 --> 55:07.717
Why am I whispering?

55:07.750 --> 55:12.487
Um, I'm in the communal area.

55:12.520 --> 55:16.158
Yeah, well, now I think
everyone's gone to bed.

55:16.192 --> 55:18.995
Thanks for the note
that you put in my bag.

55:19.028 --> 55:20.796
Yeah, I found it.

55:20.830 --> 55:22.999
Yeah, well,
I couldn't find my keys.

55:23.032 --> 55:24.901
Is he up?

55:26.903 --> 55:27.870
Hello?

55:30.806 --> 55:32.608
I can't... I can't hear you.

55:33.541 --> 55:36.511
Um... uh, miss you.

55:37.914 --> 55:38.881
Uh...

55:40.650 --> 55:41.651
Yeah.

55:44.754 --> 55:45.755
Miss you.

56:51.020 --> 56:52.288
Hey.

56:52.321 --> 56:53.956
- Hey.
- Oh, wow.

56:53.990 --> 56:55.691
Oh, welcome.

56:55.725 --> 56:57.626
So this is... this is
where you hide,

56:57.660 --> 56:59.028
is it, every morning?

56:59.061 --> 57:00.730
This is it.

57:01.797 --> 57:02.631
Oh, look at the cows.

57:02.665 --> 57:04.900
- Oh, gosh.
- Isn't this beautiful?

57:04.934 --> 57:06.802
I mean, come on.

57:06.836 --> 57:08.170
I've never really
noticed it before.

57:08.204 --> 57:10.039
Look at this,
it's such a gift.

57:10.072 --> 57:11.240
Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

57:11.273 --> 57:12.241
Isn't it?

57:12.274 --> 57:13.676
I'm glad you finally came here.

57:13.709 --> 57:15.211
I've been waiting for you
for three days.

57:15.244 --> 57:17.713
Yeah, it takes me a while
to get used to

57:17.747 --> 57:20.049
to getting my down,
gonna get ready.

57:20.082 --> 57:22.618
Yeah. How are you feeling today?

57:22.651 --> 57:24.053
Yeah, I'm feeling okay.

57:24.086 --> 57:26.989
Um, yeah, I'm not bad.

57:27.023 --> 57:28.891
I had a few drinks
last night, so...

57:28.924 --> 57:31.794
Oh, do you want to do
some stretching?

57:31.827 --> 57:34.964
Yeah, of course. Are you
more of, like, a runner or?

57:34.997 --> 57:35.965
- No.
- No?

57:35.998 --> 57:37.066
No, no, no.

57:37.099 --> 57:38.934
I'm more of
I like opening my energy

57:38.968 --> 57:42.772
and just doing some yoga
and letting the energy flow.

57:42.805 --> 57:46.675
Do you ever really release
your energy at all?

57:46.709 --> 57:48.576
I mean, 'cause you can do
breathing.

57:48.611 --> 57:50.246
- Oh.
- You do certain breathings.

57:50.279 --> 57:53.149
Do you ever, like, yeah,
build it up in your stomach

57:53.182 --> 57:55.051
and then just release?

57:55.084 --> 57:56.218
- No, I've never done it.
- Oh, okay.

57:56.252 --> 57:58.154
So take a deep breath.

57:58.187 --> 57:59.155
Now? Oh.

57:59.188 --> 58:00.890
Yeah, and... and... and, yeah.

58:00.923 --> 58:03.159
Just take it
all to your stomach, okay?

58:03.192 --> 58:04.860
One, two, three.

58:06.295 --> 58:08.164
And then release.

58:08.197 --> 58:09.365
- Hoo!
- Ah.

58:09.398 --> 58:10.166
Hoo.

58:10.199 --> 58:12.101
- That feels nice, right?
- Yeah. Cool.

58:12.134 --> 58:13.335
Yeah, do it again.

58:16.405 --> 58:18.741
- And then release.
- Woo!

58:18.774 --> 58:20.309
- Woo-hoo.
- There you go.

58:21.210 --> 58:22.311
That feels a bit nice,
doesn't it?

58:22.344 --> 58:23.512
Yeah, it's great.

58:23.546 --> 58:26.148
Why don't you just release
and do a little scream in there?

58:26.182 --> 58:27.216
- Oh okay.
- Okay? You ready?

58:27.249 --> 58:28.350
Yep.

58:28.384 --> 58:30.286
One, two, three.

58:33.322 --> 58:35.191
There you go, girl.

58:35.224 --> 58:37.326
Okay, we're gonna do this
again, right? Three...

58:39.395 --> 58:40.362
- Yeah.
- Work it out.

58:40.396 --> 58:41.931
There you go.

58:41.964 --> 58:44.667
Nice, deep scream.

58:44.700 --> 58:46.402
You know when you hear,
like, in a car crash

58:46.435 --> 58:48.804
- where the organs carry on?
- Yeah.

58:51.073 --> 58:52.241
- I feel like...
- That's how you feel?

58:52.274 --> 58:54.643
Yeah, God, I feel like I look
ridiculous.

58:54.677 --> 58:56.145
But feel you energy.
Isn't it better?

58:57.179 --> 58:58.247
- Hoo!
- Yeah.

58:58.280 --> 58:59.915
Shit.

58:59.949 --> 59:01.250
Let's hug it out,
let's hug it out.

59:01.283 --> 59:04.820
- Thanks so much.
- Aw, you did so well, girl.

59:27.376 --> 59:28.444
Ooh.

59:28.477 --> 59:30.346
This is where the magic happens.

59:33.382 --> 59:36.118
Yes, this is the, uh,
this is the studio

59:36.152 --> 59:37.853
- where we'll be working.
- Oh my God.

59:39.188 --> 59:40.289
This is where...

59:40.322 --> 59:43.893
- Holy shit.
- Yes.

59:43.926 --> 59:46.996
Oh my God, this is incredible.

59:47.029 --> 59:48.998
If there's anything
that you need.

59:49.031 --> 59:51.133
Everyone's recorded...
everyone's recorded here.

59:51.167 --> 59:52.134
This is...

59:52.168 --> 59:53.769
Thank you for bringing me here.

59:53.802 --> 59:54.703
Oh, shit.

59:54.737 --> 59:56.739
Queen recorded
Bohemian Rhapsody on here.

59:56.772 --> 59:58.340
Any other one? Oasis.

59:58.374 --> 01:00:00.376
- Wow.
- Oasis, Stones, Roses.

01:00:00.409 --> 01:00:01.944
- Coldplay.
- Mark, Mark.

01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:03.979
Come on, do you wanna hear
Mark play the piano?

01:00:04.013 --> 01:00:05.714
- You play the piano?
- Uh, I can...

01:00:05.748 --> 01:00:08.384
You gotta, like, relax,
come on, don't...

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:10.352
take that stick
out of your ass, Mark.

01:00:10.386 --> 01:00:12.955
Come on, go have some fun.

01:00:12.988 --> 01:00:14.290
Okay, um...

01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:16.192
Get it, you can do this.

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:56.532
Kelly?

01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:57.800
What?

01:00:58.934 --> 01:00:59.935
Can I come in?

01:00:59.969 --> 01:01:01.503
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

01:01:01.537 --> 01:01:03.339
- How are you?
- How are you feeling?

01:01:03.372 --> 01:01:05.341
Uh, not so good,
I wouldn't get too close.

01:01:05.374 --> 01:01:07.042
Oh, I'm fine.

01:01:07.076 --> 01:01:08.944
I've dealt with worse things

01:01:08.978 --> 01:01:09.745
in life.

01:01:09.778 --> 01:01:11.447
Here you go,
I got you some tea.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.414
Oh, that's very nice.

01:01:12.448 --> 01:01:14.950
I also got you some things
for your throat.

01:01:14.984 --> 01:01:15.951
Oh, thanks.

01:01:15.985 --> 01:01:19.188
It's so painful
to have the flu.

01:01:19.221 --> 01:01:20.189
How are you feeling?

01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:21.457
Yeah, bad timing.

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:23.225
- I know.
- Yeah.

01:01:23.259 --> 01:01:25.427
Well, it doesn't discriminate,
does it?

01:01:25.461 --> 01:01:26.895
- Mm-mm.
- The flu, it just comes

01:01:26.929 --> 01:01:29.331
whenever you're not ready
for it.

01:01:29.365 --> 01:01:30.332
Yeah.

01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:37.239
It's a bit of a bitch,
isn't it?

01:01:37.273 --> 01:01:38.240
- Yeah.
- Being sick.

01:01:38.274 --> 01:01:40.342
- Sucks.
- It's annoying.

01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:42.544
Something about this place,
you know?

01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:46.015
I don't know, makes me...
makes me sick.

01:01:52.021 --> 01:01:52.988
Um...

01:01:54.624 --> 01:01:57.026
It's been hard, uh,
for you lately, hasn't it,

01:01:57.059 --> 01:02:02.464
with the whole craziness
and Alice leaving and, you know.

01:02:03.499 --> 01:02:04.466
Yeah.

01:02:08.871 --> 01:02:10.506
Yeah, I actually don't, um...

01:02:12.508 --> 01:02:13.610
...miss her that much.

01:02:15.177 --> 01:02:16.145
That sounds terrible to say.

01:02:16.178 --> 01:02:17.379
I haven't really said that.

01:02:17.413 --> 01:02:20.082
You know, I think she'll be
better off doing her own thing.

01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:21.950
I don't think she was happy.

01:02:21.984 --> 01:02:23.886
Isn't it funny
how it works that way?

01:02:23.919 --> 01:02:29.458
Like you meet someone
and then you just drift away.

01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:30.459
- Like maybe that's...
- To change.

01:02:30.492 --> 01:02:31.493
Yeah, you need change.

01:02:31.527 --> 01:02:32.861
Humans need that change.

01:02:32.895 --> 01:02:35.230
And I feel like
maybe that's the...

01:02:35.264 --> 01:02:36.532
the scenario
with you and Alice.

01:02:36.565 --> 01:02:39.101
And it's unfortunate
that happened

01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:40.336
in the middle of an album,

01:02:40.369 --> 01:02:43.872
but I think that sometimes
maybe that's what you needed

01:02:43.906 --> 01:02:45.608
to get a new album
and new inspiration

01:02:45.642 --> 01:02:47.509
- and a new vibe, right?
- Yeah.

01:02:47.543 --> 01:02:50.012
What was your favorite band
growing up?

01:02:51.614 --> 01:02:54.350
- Um...
- Like an artist or whoever.

01:02:54.383 --> 01:02:56.352
- Yeah, I...
- But I think we could be, like,

01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:58.520
a great new Spice Girls.

01:02:58.554 --> 01:03:01.357
- I loved the Spice Girls.
- ♪ If you wanna be my lover ♪

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:03.158
Yeah, I think they're
getting back together.

01:03:03.192 --> 01:03:04.526
- Are they?
- Yeah.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.894
I'm ready for it.

01:03:05.928 --> 01:03:07.396
As long as I'm Scary Spice.

01:03:07.429 --> 01:03:08.397
You're gonna be Scary Spice.

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:09.365
- Yeah.
- Are you ready to wear

01:03:09.398 --> 01:03:10.466
- that leopard outfit?
- I'll have mucus

01:03:10.499 --> 01:03:12.167
- coming out of my nose.
- The leopard, you remember

01:03:12.201 --> 01:03:13.603
that leopard and it had ears.

01:03:13.636 --> 01:03:14.536
Yeah, yeah, she was super...

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.438
You remember that bus
that they were in?

01:03:16.472 --> 01:03:18.006
Oh yeah, the Spice World movie.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.007
That was the shit.

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:21.410
I really wanted to be
in that all the time.

01:03:21.443 --> 01:03:26.348
I'm sorry, you're all sick
and I'm just overwhelming you.

01:03:26.382 --> 01:03:28.384
It's okay, this is the most
I've spoken in a while, so...

01:03:28.417 --> 01:03:29.586
I know.

01:03:29.619 --> 01:03:30.452
We all have our process.

01:03:30.486 --> 01:03:33.122
And don't put pressure
on yourself.

01:03:33.155 --> 01:03:34.156
There's no hurry, girl.

01:03:34.189 --> 01:03:35.491
We're gonna be here
and we're gonna make

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:37.259
incredible music.

01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:39.561
That's really nice,
thanks for saying that.

01:03:39.596 --> 01:03:41.997
Yeah, I... I...

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:45.434
wanna be honest to myself.

01:03:46.636 --> 01:03:48.437
To the process of, um...

01:03:50.506 --> 01:03:53.475
I just want it to come
when I feel it's real.

01:03:53.509 --> 01:03:56.245
And if it's not,
I don't want to do it, so...

01:03:56.278 --> 01:03:59.314
Well, that's what real music is,
isn't it?

01:03:59.348 --> 01:04:01.083
- Just let it flow.
- Mm-hm.

01:04:01.116 --> 01:04:02.384
- Good talk.
- Yeah.

01:04:02.418 --> 01:04:03.452
I'll see you
in a little bit.

01:04:03.485 --> 01:04:06.188
- All right.
- Bye.

01:04:14.263 --> 01:04:16.131
Oh God.

01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:22.004
I liked her.

01:04:22.037 --> 01:04:24.741
She's gonna be
a good thing for the band

01:04:24.774 --> 01:04:27.610
and bringing in
a different energy

01:04:27.644 --> 01:04:30.446
and something more...
a bit more positive.

01:04:30.479 --> 01:04:32.481
And I think...
I'm looking forward to this.

01:04:32.514 --> 01:04:33.482
I think it's good.

01:04:33.515 --> 01:04:34.483
I think this feels like,
you know,

01:04:34.516 --> 01:04:36.118
the beginning of the end
in a way, doesn't it,

01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:38.387
- in a good way.
- Yeah.

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:42.057
So, you were saying
that you don't really like...

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:44.059
you don't really like
being in relationships.

01:04:44.092 --> 01:04:45.327
No, no.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.296
Like, I'll meet somebody
and it's good for a few months

01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:49.298
and then I'm bored
and then it happens again.

01:04:49.331 --> 01:04:51.166
- I meet someone.
- She's a bed hopper.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.568
Boing, boing, boing.

01:04:52.602 --> 01:04:55.003
- Oh, wow, that's crazy.
- Yep.

01:04:55.037 --> 01:04:56.104
Wow.

01:04:56.138 --> 01:04:58.140
- What about you, Mark?
- Hm?

01:04:58.173 --> 01:05:00.175
What are you like
in a relationship?

01:05:00.209 --> 01:05:01.644
I've been married eight years.

01:05:01.678 --> 01:05:03.378
- Eight years?
- Mm.

01:05:03.412 --> 01:05:04.747
Yeah, but are you like...

01:05:04.781 --> 01:05:09.251
are you quite
sort of together?

01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:12.154
Not... not... not geographically,
no.

01:05:12.187 --> 01:05:15.658
Even mentally, though,
I don't see the connection.

01:05:15.692 --> 01:05:17.392
We don't see each other.

01:05:17.426 --> 01:05:18.628
I'm always...

01:05:18.661 --> 01:05:21.463
Well, I'm always doing
this sort of thing.

01:05:21.497 --> 01:05:24.767
Do you still, like,
do stuff?

01:05:26.703 --> 01:05:29.238
Um, uh, what...
what do you mean?

01:05:29.271 --> 01:05:30.372
Strum the guitar.

01:05:30.405 --> 01:05:31.540
Polish the Oscar.

01:05:31.573 --> 01:05:33.242
Play the piano.

01:05:33.275 --> 01:05:34.409
Uh, um...

01:05:36.178 --> 01:05:38.815
I left the sauce sachet
in the kitchen, actually.

01:05:40.415 --> 01:05:42.017
- It'll be fine.
- That girl, no.

01:05:43.118 --> 01:05:44.587
Anyway, anyway.

01:05:46.856 --> 01:05:48.625

freaking me out,

01:08:02.324 --> 01:08:03.693

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:17.166
- Morning.
- Oh, good morning.

01:14:17.199 --> 01:14:19.201
- How are you?
- Good.

01:14:19.235 --> 01:14:20.936
- Can I sit here?
- Of course.

01:14:20.970 --> 01:14:22.071
Thank you.

01:14:22.104 --> 01:14:23.072
Did you just go for a walk?

01:14:23.105 --> 01:14:24.073
Yeah.

01:14:25.741 --> 01:14:27.910
I wanted to apologize.

01:14:27.943 --> 01:14:29.278
What for?

01:14:29.311 --> 01:14:30.279
For last night.

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.715
I'm not used
to drinking like that.

01:14:32.748 --> 01:14:34.150
Oh, don't be silly.

01:14:34.183 --> 01:14:36.819
I said a bunch
of inappropriate things.

01:14:36.852 --> 01:14:38.087
No, no, no.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.022
I can't remember
any of it don't tell me.

01:14:41.257 --> 01:14:42.291
How long are you staying for?

01:14:42.324 --> 01:14:45.061
Just two more days
and then I get back to my boy.

01:14:45.094 --> 01:14:46.062
Aw.

01:14:46.095 --> 01:14:46.996
- Do you miss him?
- I do,

01:14:47.029 --> 01:14:48.597
but also the reception
is not very good,

01:14:48.631 --> 01:14:50.933
- so you keep panicking.
- I know.

01:14:50.966 --> 01:14:53.636
He's... he's with Mark's mom
and she's not the best,

01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:54.837
but he'll be fine.

01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:55.905
He'll be fine.

01:15:00.142 --> 01:15:02.144
Is it hard?

01:15:02.178 --> 01:15:03.312
What?

01:15:04.713 --> 01:15:08.818
To balance your life.

01:15:08.851 --> 01:15:11.020
Being a professional mom
and then having a husband

01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:12.955
on the road.

01:15:12.988 --> 01:15:14.390
How do you do it?

01:15:14.423 --> 01:15:16.092
Probably not very well.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:18.828
Be supportive of each other.

01:15:18.861 --> 01:15:22.898
And without sounding naff,
we do really love each other,

01:15:22.932 --> 01:15:24.266
which helps.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.302
I can see that.

01:15:26.335 --> 01:15:27.303
When I see him.

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:35.044
What about you?

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:37.980
Are you happy?

01:15:49.191 --> 01:15:50.893
Um...

01:15:50.926 --> 01:15:52.661
I'm happy.

01:15:56.165 --> 01:15:57.299
Um...

01:15:59.268 --> 01:16:02.738
But it's... it's hard.

01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:03.873
- Yeah.
- It's really hard

01:16:03.906 --> 01:16:04.807
in that sense.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.809
Um...

01:16:06.842 --> 01:16:08.210
Balancing out everything,

01:16:08.244 --> 01:16:11.046
and a husband and touring

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.183
and being able
to fulfill myself and...

01:16:17.486 --> 01:16:19.088
You haven't
got to be everything

01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:21.223
at all times
to everybody.

01:16:23.192 --> 01:16:24.793
Yeah, you're right.

01:16:24.827 --> 01:16:26.896
So think what would
you like to do?

01:16:34.136 --> 01:16:36.839
I don't... I don't know.

01:16:38.207 --> 01:16:39.308
I'm sorry.

01:16:40.743 --> 01:16:41.710
I don't...

01:16:44.013 --> 01:16:46.415
I feel like
I'm finally getting there.

01:16:46.448 --> 01:16:48.384
I can finally really...

01:16:50.519 --> 01:16:51.921
...feel like I belong.

01:16:54.223 --> 01:16:56.825
I feel like I connect
in a different way

01:16:56.859 --> 01:16:59.728
that I've never
really connected.

01:16:59.762 --> 01:17:01.096
And I feel happy.

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:02.898
Yeah, that's great.

01:17:02.932 --> 01:17:03.899
Yeah.

01:17:03.933 --> 01:17:06.769
I guess I have to make
decisions, don't I?

01:17:08.971 --> 01:17:09.838
It's pretty hard.

01:17:09.872 --> 01:17:11.173
You can't give yourself
too hard a time,

01:17:11.207 --> 01:17:13.909
'cause we can't make all the
right decisions all the time,

01:17:13.943 --> 01:17:17.279
but it sounds like
you know what you want.

01:17:17.313 --> 01:17:19.448
You're young, you've got it
all ahead of you.

01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:23.919
Yeah.

01:17:25.888 --> 01:17:26.889
You're a great woman.

01:17:26.922 --> 01:17:28.290
Now, I don't know
about that.

01:17:31.327 --> 01:17:33.229
Well, at least I'm glad
I got to meet you.

01:17:33.262 --> 01:17:34.530
Yeah, me too.

01:17:34.563 --> 01:17:36.065
Thank you so much.

01:17:37.132 --> 01:17:38.834
Um...

01:17:38.867 --> 01:17:39.802
I'm glad you're here.

01:17:39.835 --> 01:17:41.036
Well, thank you,
I'm glad that I'm here.

01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.072
Um, and I hope you enjoy
your time.

01:17:43.105 --> 01:17:44.907
- I'll see you.
- You'll see me for sure.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.375
- Have a good day.
- You too.

01:18:37.259 --> 01:18:38.394
- Oh, look.
- See?

01:18:38.427 --> 01:18:40.296
Look, it's.

01:18:40.329 --> 01:18:41.196
Oh.

01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:44.433
And that, my friend,
is the Wonderwall.

01:18:44.466 --> 01:18:46.035
- I mean...
- This is Wonderwall?

01:18:46.068 --> 01:18:47.903
I've not been
this disappointed with a wall

01:18:47.936 --> 01:18:50.139
since I've seen
the Berlin Wall.

01:18:50.172 --> 01:18:52.408
And he sat up there
and then he sat on the wall

01:18:52.441 --> 01:18:57.046
and he was just like,
"Oh, this is the Wonderwall."

01:18:57.079 --> 01:18:58.047
And then he went like that.

01:18:59.081 --> 01:19:00.316
And then he...

01:19:00.349 --> 01:19:02.585
But I think if you sat there,
then maybe that was the wall.

01:19:02.619 --> 01:19:05.287
Yeah, that's more inspiring.

01:19:05.321 --> 01:19:06.889
Um...

01:19:07.856 --> 01:19:10.092
But it's sort of...
it's sort of...

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.329
I thought it was a metaphor.

01:19:13.362 --> 01:19:14.463
Didn't you?

01:19:14.496 --> 01:19:16.398
I thought that...
I thought a Wonderwall

01:19:16.432 --> 01:19:18.567
was kind of like
a metaphor for, you know,

01:19:18.601 --> 01:19:21.236
"You're my Wonderwall."

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:23.172
I thought it was a...
thought it was a metaphor

01:19:23.205 --> 01:19:25.074
for someone that was
there for him.

01:19:25.107 --> 01:19:28.077
But it turns out that he's
a very literal man, is Noel,

01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:32.214
and, uh,
it's an actual fucking wall.

Henry Wimbush
and his exotic wife Priscilla...

01:20:37.614 --> 01:20:39.548
- That's me.
- All right, Cilla.

01:20:39.582 --> 01:20:42.484
Uh, are joined by a party
of colorful guests

01:20:42.518 --> 01:20:45.120
whose intrigues and opinions
ensure Dennis's stay

01:20:45.154 --> 01:20:46.689
- is a memorable one.
- Yeah, I just thought

01:20:46.723 --> 01:20:50.526
it was a similar situation
to the one that you're in.

01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:52.394
Yeah, absolutely.

01:20:52.428 --> 01:20:53.696
Absolutely.

01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:55.164
I'm thinking.

01:21:51.453 --> 01:21:53.590
- Hey.
- Heya.

01:21:55.357 --> 01:21:56.759
Cold.

01:21:56.793 --> 01:21:58.427
Tried to find ya.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.662
Walk with us.

01:22:00.697 --> 01:22:01.664
You want one?

01:22:01.698 --> 01:22:03.265
Yeah, yeah, you got one... oh.

01:22:03.298 --> 01:22:04.767
- Secret.
- Secret.

01:22:04.801 --> 01:22:06.268
You good for that?

01:22:19.381 --> 01:22:20.482
It's almost over.

01:22:21.618 --> 01:22:23.485
We're almost done.

01:22:23.519 --> 01:22:25.387
It's finally done.

01:22:26.321 --> 01:22:27.456
Feels like
we haven't hung out a lot

01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:29.124
since we've been here.

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:31.360
- No.
- No.

01:22:34.096 --> 01:22:36.298
We're almost like
passing ships in the night.

01:22:36.331 --> 01:22:37.366
We spent so much time together,

01:22:37.399 --> 01:22:39.334
and then we're back to London

01:22:39.368 --> 01:22:41.804
and it's like
we don't even talk anymore.

01:22:41.838 --> 01:22:43.606
But I know that's my fault.

01:22:47.142 --> 01:22:48.110
Well...

01:22:49.077 --> 01:22:50.713
It's hard,
we're always together,

01:22:50.747 --> 01:22:53.583
but we're, like, not mentally
all together, you know?

01:22:53.616 --> 01:22:55.618
- Yep.
- Where here to

01:22:55.652 --> 01:22:58.253
it just feels like now we're
here to do a job.

01:22:58.287 --> 01:23:00.455
And it wasn't
like that before.

01:23:00.489 --> 01:23:01.390
Mm-mm, I know,

01:23:01.423 --> 01:23:03.660
we just felt, like,
lucky we were doing it.

01:23:03.693 --> 01:23:05.093
We were getting away
with something.

01:23:05.127 --> 01:23:06.428
Yeah.

01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:07.864
We were the lucky ones.

01:23:09.599 --> 01:23:12.534
Now we're trapped
in our own success.

01:23:12.568 --> 01:23:14.169
Damn the success.

01:23:15.738 --> 01:23:17.372
Let's hang out more though
when I get back.

01:23:18.641 --> 01:23:19.709
Go do something fun.

01:23:19.742 --> 01:23:23.111
Go where you do your thing
and then magic appears.

01:23:23.145 --> 01:23:25.113
That's what you do.

01:23:25.147 --> 01:23:27.449
I don't know if it's working
for me anymore.

01:23:27.482 --> 01:23:31.386
Might need to change
my hat, as they say.

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:33.488
- Yeah.
- Keep the hat.

01:23:33.522 --> 01:23:34.757
Keep your hat.

01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:35.758
Yeah.

01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:40.697
Yeah.

01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:44.132
I think we should just
kick everyone else out.

01:23:44.166 --> 01:23:45.133
Yeah, right?

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:46.234
Just back to us two.

01:23:46.268 --> 01:23:48.203
Start at the beginning.

01:23:48.236 --> 01:23:49.504
Start partying again.

01:23:49.538 --> 01:23:51.373
Yeah, back to the old days.

01:23:51.406 --> 01:23:52.507
Yeah.

01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:53.810
Kelly and Jess
are in the building.

01:23:53.843 --> 01:23:54.811
Yeah.

01:23:59.214 --> 01:24:00.783
I promise.

01:24:00.817 --> 01:24:01.818
Really.

01:24:06.889 --> 01:24:07.890
I love you.

01:24:07.924 --> 01:24:09.291
I love you too.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.261
Mm, come here.
Mm, come here.

01:24:14.897 --> 01:24:15.865
Are you eating my hair?

01:24:15.898 --> 01:24:16.866
Yes.

01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:26.208
- Get it, Joe.
- I feel like this is

01:24:26.241 --> 01:24:27.376
the happiest he's ever been.

01:24:27.409 --> 01:24:28.778
He's so happy.

01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:31.546
He's also so lonely in here.

01:24:31.581 --> 01:24:33.583
- Great dancing.
- Yeah.

01:24:33.616 --> 01:24:34.717
He's my sex slave actually.

01:24:35.952 --> 01:24:38.286
At night, I, uh...

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.656
- No words.
- No words.

01:24:39.689 --> 01:24:40.522
- No.
- Silence.

01:24:40.555 --> 01:24:42.224
- It's like a bondage thing.
- Nice.

01:24:42.257 --> 01:24:43.291
- Yeah.
- I like that.

01:24:43.325 --> 01:24:44.226
You would never expect it.

01:24:44.259 --> 01:24:46.663
Yeah, 'cause
he's such a shy guy.

01:24:46.696 --> 01:24:47.930
Yeah, he's dirty as hell.

01:24:47.964 --> 01:24:49.699
- No, mm.
- Yep.

01:24:49.732 --> 01:24:51.400
Um, I got you a gift.

01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:52.434
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:24:52.467 --> 01:24:53.435
That's nice.

01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:54.871
Yeah, I don't want it
to be weird or anything,

01:24:54.904 --> 01:24:56.606
but I just saw it
and I thought of you,

01:24:56.639 --> 01:24:57.974
maybe you'd like it.

01:24:58.007 --> 01:24:59.441
- Is it... is it money?
- Yeah, it's money.

01:24:59.474 --> 01:25:00.575
Most people think of me
when they...

01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:03.245
Here, that's what the bank
does to me when I go.

01:25:03.278 --> 01:25:04.479
I'm like, "I'll take
some money."

01:25:04.513 --> 01:25:06.415
And they're like, "Sure."

01:25:06.448 --> 01:25:08.250
Um, no, it's, uh,

01:25:08.283 --> 01:25:10.519
it's something that
you would never expect.

01:25:10.552 --> 01:25:11.788
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25:13.022 --> 01:25:13.990
Hey.

01:25:15.024 --> 01:25:15.992
Hey, it's a glass heart.

01:25:16.025 --> 01:25:17.760
It is a glass heart.

01:25:17.794 --> 01:25:19.327
That's very sweet.

01:25:19.361 --> 01:25:20.562
Unexpected, right?

01:25:20.596 --> 01:25:21.496
Yeah.

01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:22.999
But it has meaning,
it has a lot of meaning.

01:25:23.032 --> 01:25:25.434
It's dark and it's light
at the same time.

01:25:25.467 --> 01:25:28.403
And it's just fragile.

01:25:28.437 --> 01:25:32.008
Just as a glass heart
and you gotta protect it.

01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:33.943
That's right, you gotta protect
what's important to you.

01:25:33.976 --> 01:25:36.311
Yeah, but it's a rock

01:25:36.344 --> 01:25:37.980
that protects you
because it has good vibes,

01:25:38.014 --> 01:25:39.649
so keep it close to you
on tour.

01:25:39.682 --> 01:25:41.416
Okay, yeah.

01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:42.985
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

01:25:44.987 --> 01:25:46.989
Um, this has been pretty cool.

01:25:47.023 --> 01:25:49.424
- Thank you for this...
- Oh, that looks really nice.

01:25:49.458 --> 01:25:51.560
- Thank you.
- Look at that.

01:25:51.594 --> 01:25:53.596
Hm, I'm glad you liked it.

01:25:54.697 --> 01:25:56.733
Um, do you wanna go get drunk?

01:25:56.766 --> 01:25:58.433
Trying to.

Yeah, so those are the...
the first three

01:27:30.092 --> 01:27:33.528
that we have now,
but we're still working on the...

01:27:33.562 --> 01:27:34.997
they're still kind of,
like, demos, but...

01:27:35.031 --> 01:27:36.799
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:27:37.834 --> 01:27:39.401
Nice trousers.

01:27:40.736 --> 01:27:42.038
Should wear them more.

01:27:42.805 --> 01:27:43.773
Thanks.

01:27:43.806 --> 01:27:45.708
Yeah, got 'em for cheap.

01:27:49.712 --> 01:27:51.647
It's fuckin' hot in here, eh?

01:27:51.681 --> 01:27:52.815
Mm.

01:28:14.502 --> 01:28:15.738
Eh?

01:28:16.806 --> 01:28:18.608
It's great, it's really good.

01:28:18.641 --> 01:28:19.642
It's very, very strong.

01:28:19.675 --> 01:28:20.776
Great vocals, everything.

01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:23.511
Honestly, you should be
very, very proud of yourselves.

01:28:23.545 --> 01:28:24.512
- Great.
- Thank you.

01:28:24.546 --> 01:28:25.982
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:28:26.015 --> 01:28:30.653
- Thank you.
- I suggest you leave here ASAP.

01:28:30.686 --> 01:28:31.954
Get some sun,
get some rest.

01:28:31.988 --> 01:28:32.955
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

01:28:32.989 --> 01:28:34.657
And then we go to London.

01:28:34.690 --> 01:28:37.693
So I've got you a house
in Notting Hill.

01:28:37.727 --> 01:28:39.161
I'm not guaranteeing
you're gonna see, uh,

01:28:39.195 --> 01:28:41.197
what's his name,
the posh fella, Hugh Grant.

01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:42.198
Hugh Grant, yeah.

01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:43.299
But you're going
to Notting Hill.

01:28:43.332 --> 01:28:47.469
And I'll give you four weeks
to do it, all right?

01:28:47.502 --> 01:28:48.704
Well, carry on.

01:28:48.738 --> 01:28:51.040
- Okay.
- Carry on 'cause I like it.

01:28:51.073 --> 01:28:52.108
- Thank you.
- All right?

01:28:52.141 --> 01:28:53.109
- Well done.
- Great.

01:28:53.142 --> 01:28:54.542
- Thank you.
- So happy, Jamie.

01:28:54.576 --> 01:28:55.711
Thank you, Jamie.

01:28:55.745 --> 01:28:57.113
Okay, I just want
a little word with Mark.

01:28:57.146 --> 01:29:00.049
- Okay, sure.
- Well done, well done.

01:29:00.082 --> 01:29:01.918
I mean, yeah, I can't take
all the credit.

01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:06.554
Uh, the girls did a lot
of work and, yeah, yeah.

01:29:06.589 --> 01:29:08.090
Well, I gave you some time
and you fuckin' come up

01:29:08.124 --> 01:29:09.457
with the goods.

01:29:09.491 --> 01:29:11.027
Um, thanks, yes.

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:12.128
How are you feeling
in yourself?

01:29:12.161 --> 01:29:13.596
- Good.
- Yeah?

01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:14.997
Yeah, I feel good.

01:29:15.031 --> 01:29:16.498
You're the man, aren't ya?

01:29:18.067 --> 01:29:19.735
- I... I d...
- You're the man.

01:29:19.769 --> 01:29:22.705
- I do appear to be.
- Yeah, all right?

01:29:22.738 --> 01:29:23.739
Yeah.

01:29:23.773 --> 01:29:26.541
Now, I cancelled
my holiday to come down here.

01:29:26.574 --> 01:29:28.244
Mm-hm.

01:29:28.277 --> 01:29:30.246
I don't like
to let my family down.

01:29:30.279 --> 01:29:32.547
Mm-hm.

01:29:32.581 --> 01:29:33.749
You understand that,
don't you?

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.055
Yeah.

01:29:40.923 --> 01:29:42.625
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

01:29:42.658 --> 01:29:44.126
Yeah.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.528
Now go and make me
a nice cup of tea.

01:29:47.163 --> 01:29:48.496
All right?

01:29:49.632 --> 01:29:50.599
Good man.

01:29:50.633 --> 01:29:51.901
Well done, well done.

01:29:57.306 --> 01:29:58.741
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:29:58.774 --> 01:29:59.742
Is he still in there?

01:30:00.776 --> 01:30:01.777
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:30:01.811 --> 01:30:02.945
What a piece of shit, huh?

01:30:02.979 --> 01:30:03.946
Absolute piece of shit, yeah.

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:07.183
One of the biggest bellends
I've ever met.

01:30:07.216 --> 01:30:08.516
I mean, he freakin'
touched my pants.

01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:10.853
He's totally a sexist pig.

01:30:10.886 --> 01:30:11.854
Absolutely crazy.

01:30:11.887 --> 01:30:12.855
But that's the music industry.

01:30:12.888 --> 01:30:13.956
Anyways.

01:30:15.024 --> 01:30:16.826
That went well.

01:30:16.859 --> 01:30:19.161
Um... it didn't just go well.

01:30:19.195 --> 01:30:20.162
It went amazingly well.

01:30:20.196 --> 01:30:21.397
It went perfectly.

01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:22.932
It couldn't have gone...
it couldn't have gone better.

01:30:22.965 --> 01:30:24.233
It really couldn't have
gone better, no.

01:30:24.266 --> 01:30:25.901
I mean, he sees
just dollar signs,

01:30:25.935 --> 01:30:27.103
that's all he sees,
but that's fine with me

01:30:27.136 --> 01:30:28.137
'cause that's all
I see in him.

01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:32.842
- And that's great.
- So, that being said, um,

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:36.779
I know it's a weird transition,
but, Mark...

01:30:38.347 --> 01:30:39.882
...going to London,

01:30:39.915 --> 01:30:42.051
starting fresh
to finish this record,

01:30:42.084 --> 01:30:45.254
I don't think
we should be working together

01:30:45.287 --> 01:30:46.989
professionally anymore.

01:30:51.694 --> 01:30:52.895
Okay, um...

01:30:53.896 --> 01:30:55.965
Well, I mean, it's...
that's... that...

01:30:55.998 --> 01:30:56.832
that's the conversation now,

01:30:56.866 --> 01:30:58.234
because they've put
a lot of money

01:30:58.267 --> 01:30:59.635
into the album so far.

01:30:59.668 --> 01:31:00.736
No, no, no,
staying with the label.

01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:01.704
They're... yeah, of course.

01:31:01.737 --> 01:31:03.571
I'm talking about you
as our manager.

01:31:03.606 --> 01:31:04.974
Oh. Oh, uh...

01:31:05.908 --> 01:31:07.243
What would I...

01:31:07.276 --> 01:31:09.612
You would no longer
be our manager.

01:31:09.645 --> 01:31:10.646
What do I do then?

01:31:10.679 --> 01:31:12.915
You're fired
from the position.

01:31:17.386 --> 01:31:20.322
Um, okay, so you're firing me.

01:31:20.356 --> 01:31:21.824
Yes.

01:31:21.857 --> 01:31:22.992
As of?

01:31:23.025 --> 01:31:24.360
- Now.
- Now?

01:31:24.393 --> 01:31:26.162
- Yeah.
- Ah.

01:31:26.195 --> 01:31:27.763
- You're not lying?
- I'm not lying.

01:31:27.797 --> 01:31:28.731
- You're fired.
- You're not lying.

01:31:28.764 --> 01:31:30.933
- I'm really fired.
- You're so fired.

01:31:30.966 --> 01:31:33.202
I'm... I'm so fucking fired.

01:31:33.235 --> 01:31:35.271
You're fucking done, bro,
you're out.

01:31:35.304 --> 01:31:37.706
- I am over.
- It's over.

01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:38.741
- What?
- I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

01:31:38.774 --> 01:31:40.009
Get the fucking car.

01:31:40.042 --> 01:31:41.210
But she just cornered you?

01:31:41.243 --> 01:31:42.611
Yeah.

01:31:42.645 --> 01:31:43.946
It's the best day
of my life.

01:31:43.979 --> 01:31:45.948
I know, I know.

01:31:50.019 --> 01:31:51.954
Let's turn the... let's turn
the air conditioning.

01:31:51.987 --> 01:31:53.823
Fucking hell.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:56.358
- Just drive.
- What happened?

01:31:56.392 --> 01:31:57.359
- Drive.
- ...What happened?

01:31:57.393 --> 01:31:58.794
Shut up and drive.

01:32:00.996 --> 01:32:02.164
Right, my little bitches.

01:32:02.198 --> 01:32:03.432
Hello.

01:32:03.466 --> 01:32:06.202
Uh, the van's here, so, if you
all are ready to lock and load.

01:32:06.235 --> 01:32:08.971
- Yes.
- Awesome.

01:32:09.004 --> 01:32:11.740
- That's it.
- Any... anything you wanna say or?

01:32:11.774 --> 01:32:13.042
Uh, yeah, actually.

01:32:13.075 --> 01:32:15.144
Um...

01:32:15.177 --> 01:32:17.179
Dearly beloved,
