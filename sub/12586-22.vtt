WEBVTT

00:34.534 --> 00:35.702
-Lucky!

00:35.785 --> 00:37.620
They have baby ballerina tutus!

00:37.704 --> 00:40.623
Galaxy of Babies And fuzzy-hooded jammies
with bunny ears!

00:40.999 --> 00:42.500


00:42.584 --> 00:45.128
Like a teeny fuzzy bunny baby!

00:45.211 --> 00:46.963
That's real nice, Luanne.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.008
Why don't you buy the baby stuff?
My treat.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.177
Oh, thank you.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.095
I just need your credit card number.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.097
Oh, I don't have a credit card.

00:56.181 --> 01:00.143
Now, if the computer will accept cash
or my word of honor...

01:00.226 --> 01:02.062
You don't have a credit card?

01:02.145 --> 01:05.356
-But you're a grown man.
Yes, I am.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.611
We are going to have a baby.
And it needs a normal family.

01:09.694 --> 01:13.656
I mean, there's no grandma and grandpa
because Mama's away in prison.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.868
And Daddy's off at sea working
on his oil rig.

01:16.951 --> 01:20.371
Normal families buy things
on credit cards!

01:23.666 --> 01:26.544
Then as the daddy,
I will do the righteous thing.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.588
I will apply for a credit card.

01:31.800 --> 01:35.095
-Uncle Hank will you check
my spelling on my application?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.805
Well, sure, Lucky. I...

01:37.013 --> 01:38.014
Uh... Hm.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.059
Here, under employer, you put Costco.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.311
-You never worked for Costco.
No.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.064
But Costco gave me
the slip-on pee-pee money

01:46.147 --> 01:47.065
for my settlement.

01:47.148 --> 01:50.276
Pee-pee money
is not an employment history.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.821
And look, you left
your social-security number blank.

01:52.904 --> 01:57.659
Oh, I don't have one of them social cards,
or a driver's license.

01:57.742 --> 02:02.455
My dad always said a man's wallet
should only hold cash, a razor blade,

02:02.539 --> 02:04.457
and a lucky poker chip.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.584
Lucky, is that the sort of father

02:06.668 --> 02:08.336
you want to be to your child?

02:09.254 --> 02:11.089
I can see you have a point.

02:11.172 --> 02:16.594
The problem is I have no idea
how to get any of these cards and things.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.096
Okay, I'll help.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.931
But you have to be serious.

02:20.014 --> 02:23.476
I am gonna make appointments for you.
And you are gonna keep them.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.646
-Will this involve wearing a watch?
-Yes, it will.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.442
Then so be it.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.946
Well, it'll be hard work helping Lucky.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.239
But fun too.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.116
Just don't fix his teeth, Hank.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.492
It's the one thing I have on him.

02:42.579 --> 02:46.249
Which one of you fellows ordered two dozen
39-foot aluminum rails?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.792
That would be me!

02:48.918 --> 02:51.588
Gentlemen, I'm sure you recall
my long dreamt dream

02:51.671 --> 02:54.591
of building a guard tower in my yard.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.678
Dale, the zoning board
has turned you down six times.

02:58.761 --> 03:02.182
The last refusal
was "with extreme prejudice."

03:02.265 --> 03:06.728
True. But for a structure under 40 feet,
no variance is needed.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.771
Soon you'll live under the
protection of my...

03:08.855 --> 03:11.441
...39-foot guard tower.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.444
The zoning board has no say.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.446
-Dale, that is--
-No say!

03:16.946 --> 03:18.573
Now, if you help me build it,

03:18.656 --> 03:21.201
I'll give each of you a tier
in the Tower of Power.

03:22.535 --> 03:23.745
Oh, I want a tier!

03:28.958 --> 03:31.044
<i>♪ La Peggy Hill, cha ♪</i>

03:31.127 --> 03:32.837
<i>♪ La Peggy Hill, cha ♪</i>

03:32.921 --> 03:34.964
<i>♪ Doing dishes in the sink ♪ </i>

03:35.048 --> 03:35.924
<i>♪ La... ♪</i>

03:38.760 --> 03:40.511
Y'ello. Hoyt!

03:41.179 --> 03:43.640
Well, of course I'm fine. Where are you?

03:43.723 --> 03:45.642
-Aunt Peggy...
-To Arlen?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.685
Well, do you have a place to stay?

03:48.478 --> 03:49.354
Of course.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.316
Did you know Luanne is having a baby?

03:53.399 --> 03:55.151
You will be a grandfather.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.322
Aunt Peggy? Who is it?

03:59.405 --> 04:00.823
Call when you get here.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.825
Luanne, that was your father.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.411
Daddy? On the oil rig?

04:05.495 --> 04:06.329
Hah!

04:06.412 --> 04:08.331
Well, why didn't you let me talk to him?

04:08.414 --> 04:10.959
Well, he only had a three-minute
coffee break.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.253
They are very strict on the oil rigs.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.879
Did you hear that, baby?

04:14.963 --> 04:17.423
Your grandpa's coming to visit you.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.391
We were overdoing it on salty snacks.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.893
So I put out some crudités.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.982
So Peggy,
I finally get to meet your brother.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.693
An oil man and a propane man.

04:36.776 --> 04:40.321
Two energy professionals
in the same family.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.366
It truly is a momentous family day.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.494
And that's why I wore my good bolo tie.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.288
Not the one with the skull.

04:48.371 --> 04:52.917
My daddy and my baby daddy
will be together in one room!

04:53.960 --> 04:57.714
Now the baby will have, like... heritage?

04:57.797 --> 04:58.756
There's the taxi.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.924
I'd better get the door.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.388
My kid sister! Look at you!

05:05.471 --> 05:06.723
You ain't changed a bit!

05:08.266 --> 05:09.350
And look at you.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.728
Letting yourself into my home
without my help.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.022
Hank Hill.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.606
It's nice to finally meet you, Hoyt.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.191
Thrilled to meet you too, Hank.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.860
Whoo!

05:18.943 --> 05:20.486
Who's this foxy little number?

05:21.487 --> 05:24.073
Hoyt, that's your daughter, Luanne.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.241
Daddy!

05:25.366 --> 05:26.284
Hey!

05:26.367 --> 05:28.995
Last time I saw you,
you were a princess this high.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.414
And now you're a grown-up beauty queen!

05:32.290 --> 05:33.291
So Hoyt...

05:33.374 --> 05:34.792
Time for presents.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.336
This is for you, my sister.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.882
Why, thanks. Oh, lottery tickets.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.426
And you were kind enough to scratch them.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.971
And here's something for this kid
of yours.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.390
My name is Bobby, Uncle Hoyt.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.020
A doll?

05:54.103 --> 05:57.148
Peggy, I could have sworn you told me
you had a little girl.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.525
Sorry, champ. Okay, Luanne. It's for you.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.819
I love it.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.363
Uh...

06:03.446 --> 06:07.116
Peggy, you and I need to check
on the roast

06:07.200 --> 06:10.078
while Hoyt and Luanne
have some time together.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.831
Shoot, that's right.
I forgot to pay the cab driver outside.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.249
Could somebody pay him for me?

06:17.919 --> 06:18.920
Uh-oh.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.254
Okay.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.300
Peggy, what the hell is going on here?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.303
Your brother has not been working
on an oil rig.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.474
You are right. And I am sorry.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.434
Hank, the truth is...

06:34.394 --> 06:37.563
-Hoyt just got out of prison.
-What? No!

06:39.399 --> 06:41.442
Now we're a normal family!

06:52.829 --> 06:54.789
How could you not tell me your own brother

06:54.872 --> 06:56.249
is a convict?

06:56.332 --> 06:58.334
I was trying to protect Luanne.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.421
You know she'd be crushed
if she knew the truth about her father.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.214
But you could have told me!

07:03.297 --> 07:04.257
Look,

07:04.340 --> 07:06.426
Hoyt's had a troubled past.
But he's here now.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.511
And I want to try to help him.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.472
I don't know, Peggy.
Are you sure he's helpable?

07:11.556 --> 07:14.142
Well, he just needs good influences, Hank.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.352
Like what you're doing with Lucky.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.105
Well, I guess it's worth a try.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.107
Hoyt is family, after all.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.233
Then we are agreed.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.902
All we have to do is fix
all of Lucky's problems,

07:24.986 --> 07:26.195
reform my brother,

07:26.279 --> 07:29.699
and keep his prison record a secret
from Luanne. Piece of cake.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.581
Well, we're doing great on our list,

07:36.664 --> 07:37.498
Lucky.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.793
Now, later today
we'll go see my guy about a will.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.088
You want to make sure
the right people inherit your debts.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.257
I feel I am in good hands.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.265
This'll put the fire out. Right, guys?

07:55.349 --> 07:57.393
Here. Have a beer with me.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.231
It's just one, Uncle Hank.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.567
I'll be straight when we meet your guy.

08:10.364 --> 08:15.620
County regulations come into force
if the structure's area's 10 by 10 feet.

08:15.703 --> 08:18.664
So we must be exactly nine and nine

08:18.748 --> 08:21.250
10ths' feet by nine and nine 10ths' feet.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.668
I tell you what, man...

08:22.752 --> 08:23.961
We're talking about an old sly fox, man.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.255
Ol' dang ol' meaning of "is" is.
You know, man?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.841
I... Man, I miss the ol' '90s, man.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.469
"What happens to a dream deferred?

08:31.636 --> 08:34.514
Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?

08:34.597 --> 08:37.391
Or does it rise to a height
of exactly 39 feet,

08:37.475 --> 08:41.479
teaching the zoning board
who not to mess with?"

08:41.562 --> 08:45.525
-I know the answer!
-And soon, Bill, so will they.

08:46.901 --> 08:47.902
So now you're free.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.905
For Luanne's sake
and for your own sake, Hoyt,

08:50.988 --> 08:52.865
now you have got to straighten out.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.702
-This is fantastic coffee, Peggy.
-Thank you. But please stay on topic.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.496
I will work with you to help.

08:58.704 --> 09:02.250
-But the keyword here is "work."
-It's what I'm here for.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.209
To straighten out.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.753
I know we can do it, together, you and me.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.004
Hi, Daddy.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.339
And Luanne!

09:08.422 --> 09:10.675
I invited her for breakfast.
I hope that was okay.

09:10.758 --> 09:11.884
Hey, sweetums.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.471
So today I'll fix a special breakfast

09:15.555 --> 09:17.390
for my special girl.

09:17.473 --> 09:21.060
A special breakfast! Yay!

09:27.316 --> 09:28.317
Well...

09:28.401 --> 09:29.819
You two enjoy yourselves.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.116
Daddy, I've always wanted to ask...

09:35.199 --> 09:36.492
You know what, darling?

09:36.576 --> 09:37.868
We need some more eggs.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.079
Can you lend me some money
to go to buy the eggs?

09:40.162 --> 09:42.456
Of course. Is $10 enough?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.083
Can you make it more like 50?

09:44.375 --> 09:45.418
Mm-hm.

09:45.501 --> 09:49.005
Great.
I'll be back so quick you'll call me...

09:49.088 --> 09:50.006
Quickie McGee!

09:54.594 --> 09:55.678
It's amazing.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.388
Uncle Hank, I never dreamed

09:57.471 --> 10:00.766
that being a straight-up citizen involved
so much work.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.395
Well, here's the form you need.
And soon you'll need this.

10:04.478 --> 10:08.816
Voter registration.
It's your magic key to jury duty.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.945
Luanne, how was breakfast
with your father?

10:13.029 --> 10:15.656
I don't know. He hasn't come back yet.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.199
What if Daddy got lost?

10:19.994 --> 10:20.870
Y'ello?

10:21.037 --> 10:22.413
Uh-huh.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.707
Yeah, I understand. How much?

10:25.082 --> 10:27.293
Whoo-hoo!

10:27.418 --> 10:28.502
Whoo-hoo! Yeah, baby!

10:32.214 --> 10:34.592
See? Told you I was good for it.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.678
You know what, Hoyt?
Maybe I shouldn't bail you out.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.848
Maybe this gentleman
should just take you out back

10:40.931 --> 10:45.019
and teach you whatever sort of lesson
he is teaching these days.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.062
Maybe.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.066
But how would you explain
my busted face to Luanne?

10:50.149 --> 10:53.444
She's kind of in a fragile state.
I think that might upset her.

11:01.702 --> 11:02.912
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.874
But since you're both here now,
how about some double trouble?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.042
Not a chance!

11:08.125 --> 11:11.671
Look, it's my job to ask.
My boss is standing right here.

11:16.092 --> 11:20.846
I have defied the government.
And yet I cannot be punished for it.

11:20.930 --> 11:24.266
"He wept because there were
no more worlds to conquer."

11:25.267 --> 11:27.937
Yeah, yeah. Redneck claim it legal.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.106
But there got to be
something wrong with it!

11:30.731 --> 11:33.317
Because it built by rednecks!
Get out here!

11:33.401 --> 11:35.820
And don't stop inspecting
until you find fault!

11:40.032 --> 11:42.702
I wonder where Daddy
has been all this time.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.871
Tonight we were going to look through
our family photo album together.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.250
Don't worry, beautiful.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.753
He's probably busy
making important oil phone calls.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.381
Janine! You there?

12:04.265 --> 12:05.266
Janine!

12:06.016 --> 12:08.519
I'm Lucky, Dad. You're in Arlen.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.065
Hi, Daddy!

12:14.316 --> 12:18.279
Baby girl, I need some time alone
with your daddy,

12:18.362 --> 12:20.322
you know, to talk about father stuff.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.783
Go to bed early and get your baby sleep.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.244
Good idea. Goodnight, Daddy.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.587
Well, I'm a lot better now.
Here, I owe you.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.465
See, on the oil rig, these are like money.

12:38.299 --> 12:42.720
Dad, were you in the state oil rig
or the federal?

12:42.803 --> 12:44.305
Smart man!

12:47.141 --> 12:49.268
That means we're like family.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.438
Say I got 10 cigarettes.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.024
And you pay me 10 more
for watching your back.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.193
-Now how many I got?
-Twenty.

12:57.276 --> 13:01.280
No. Only 15.
Because I got to pay a tax to the guard.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.783
Cigarette math is full of surprises.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.869
Hey. Let's go downtown
and I'll buy you some pancakes.

13:07.578 --> 13:11.373
Sorry, no. I have an appointment
with Uncle Hank at the DMV.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.918
I'm pulling rank here on Uncle Hank.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.004
Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes!

13:21.550 --> 13:23.636
<i>Number 56, window C.</i>

13:24.220 --> 13:25.095
Dangit.

13:26.514 --> 13:30.935
Uh... Sir, I apologize
on behalf of citizen 56.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.604
Please don't judge him harshly.
He's a good man.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.022
You have to believe me.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.900
I promise you
this will never happen again.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.655
-Fifty-seven, window C.
-Dangit!

13:45.366 --> 13:49.286
So he says, "Wait.
That ain't no chocolate cake!"

13:50.538 --> 13:52.456
You are funny, Dad.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.000
Well, had to do something
to pass the time.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.377
I'm gonna go pay the check.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.300
<i>Lucky, it's 10:00.</i>
<i>Where the heck are you?</i>

14:03.843 --> 14:06.178
Oh, no! Uncle Hank!

14:06.262 --> 14:07.221
Walk with me, Lucky.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.893
Those two! Hey! Get back here!

14:12.977 --> 14:14.103
Run with me, Lucky!

14:20.818 --> 14:22.945
Sorry, I was alone at the register.
And it was open.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.656
And there were all
these beautiful $100 bills!

14:28.284 --> 14:30.411
Get back here! Police!

14:33.122 --> 14:34.456
Damnit! This way!

14:42.715 --> 14:45.426
Damn this state! Damnit!

14:45.509 --> 14:48.137
-I have to tell you something important.
-What, Dad?

14:48.262 --> 14:49.722
Now, I've been to prison more than once.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.390
And if they find me with all this money,

14:51.473 --> 14:53.726
that's strike three
and I'm going away for good.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.936
Dad, that's... that's awful.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.231
If they found this money on you instead,
they'd go easy on you.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.317
And Luanne wouldn't have
to have her heart broken.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.694
There they are.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.322
Don't move.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.408
All right. Give me the money.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.704
-Hands up!
-I surrender.

15:13.787 --> 15:17.041
I, the guilty party, am not armed.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.711
Please do not harm
my innocent friend here.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.383
Whew!

15:26.467 --> 15:27.468
That was close.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.978
We were going to be normal!

15:38.062 --> 15:41.857
But now the baby will be born
with a criminal record!

15:41.941 --> 15:45.277
You've ruined everything!

15:45.361 --> 15:47.154
Hey! Keep it down, will you?

15:47.237 --> 15:49.782
Sorry, sir. But she's very upset.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.368
She's upset? I'm in freakin' jail!

15:52.451 --> 15:54.995
Why couldn't you be more like Daddy?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.455
Ah!

15:57.456 --> 16:00.292
Why would you throw away everything
we've worked for?

16:00.376 --> 16:02.753
We were even getting you into Triple A.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.590
Luanne needs her daddy.
I can't let him leave her again.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.509
I did what had to be done.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.806
Dangit. It was Hoyt.
You're innocent, aren't you?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.432
I don't know how innocent I'd feel

16:15.516 --> 16:18.477
if I let Luanne's daddy go
to prison forever.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.729
Thank you for helping
with my identity though.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.024
You'll be interested to know
that I now have fingerprints.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.990
Intruder alert! Danger!

16:31.073 --> 16:33.617
This thing is paying for itself already.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.743
Gribble,

16:34.827 --> 16:36.328
I bring a county building inspector

16:36.412 --> 16:37.830
to condemn your eyesore.

16:37.913 --> 16:41.000
Inspect away! You can't touch me!

16:41.083 --> 16:44.837
This tower's only 99 feet square.
It's non-residential.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.172
And it doesn't even have a foundation.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.298
Hold... hold on for a minute.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.343
With a base that narrow
and has no foundation,

16:51.427 --> 16:52.720
forget the law for a minute.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.264
Are you a complete imbecile?

16:55.347 --> 16:56.724
Imbecile, eh?

16:56.807 --> 16:59.268
I fail to take your meaning, sir.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.649
Aaah...

17:10.487 --> 17:12.072
Well, that changes things.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.200
Inspector.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.537
Fine this redneck
for reckless redneck-itude.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.668
You tried your best to help him.
But helping time is over.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.212
An innocent man is going to prison.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.006
I just need to try harder.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.591
He... he's my brother, Hank.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.596
What really gets me is you know Hoyt's
just gonna screw up again

17:35.679 --> 17:37.347
and get a third strike anyway.

17:38.348 --> 17:39.725
I don't know what to do.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.145
Hey, Dad. I was talking to Uncle Hoyt.

17:43.228 --> 17:48.525
Is it true if I got caught at a crime,
they'd let me go because I'm just a kid?

17:48.609 --> 17:49.943
Why did he tell you that?

17:50.027 --> 17:53.280
He says the system is surprising.

17:53.363 --> 17:57.076
Like he says,
Luanne would never go to jail

17:57.159 --> 17:59.912
because a jury would think
she's too pretty.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.085
Bobby, go to your room
and alphabetize your troll dolls.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.044
Okay.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.839
Hoyt would eventually take us all down.
Wouldn't he?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.928
All right then.
We are getting him his third strike.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.566
Hoyt, we are going out for dinner.
We'll be gone for several hours.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.610
Great! Enjoy.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.320
You know, Hank, why don't you drive?

18:33.403 --> 18:35.489
That way I can leave
my car keys here at home...

18:35.572 --> 18:37.741
...right here next to my purse.

18:54.758 --> 18:55.759
What the hey...

18:59.638 --> 19:00.973
Oh, hell.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.518
Oh, you guys got it all wrong!

19:05.894 --> 19:08.230
That stuff wasn't for me!
It was for my daughter!

19:09.648 --> 19:11.275
She self-medicates!

19:11.358 --> 19:13.986
Her name is Luanne Platter!
I can tell you where she lives!

19:18.365 --> 19:20.033
Hank, you got to get me out of here.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.285
This was a mistake.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.371
You're not getting out of this, Hoyt.
You're in too deep.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.749
Lucky, there's no reason to take the rap
for him now.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.084
Won't do him any good.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.796
Not so fast.
I mean, don't put ideas in the man's head.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.132
There's still got to be some kind of way.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.467
Hoyt, listen. You're done.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.179
Now, the decent thing
would be for you to confess

19:40.262 --> 19:44.641
and get Lucky off so he and your daughter
can get their lives started the right way.

19:49.354 --> 19:53.192
Hank, don't tell Luanne
I went down like this as a favor to me.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.820
Well, we probably would do that anyway.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.989
But all right, for you.

19:59.156 --> 19:59.990
Uh...

20:00.073 --> 20:01.116
Officer?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.744
Mister Platter here has something
he'd like to say.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.875
To celebrate my freedom...

20:09.958 --> 20:13.378
and my new credit card,
ice cream is on me.

20:13.754 --> 20:17.758
Lucky, I'm so proud
you confessed to stealing

20:17.841 --> 20:20.677
to protect that little crippled boy
who really did it.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.014
But now what will happen
to the little crippled boy?

20:24.097 --> 20:24.932
Ah-ah-ah.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.100
I cannot keep lying anymore.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.061
It's time Luanne knew the truth.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.772
What truth?

20:34.983 --> 20:38.862
The crippled boy will be released
and given a brand new wheelchair!

20:38.946 --> 20:40.697
Oh, good.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.074
Oh.

20:42.157 --> 20:45.369
I'm just sad Daddy
had to go back to his oil rig again.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.246
He would be so proud of you.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.497
Oh, he sure would.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.375
But they really need him on that oil rig.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.836
Otherwise, they wouldn't have given him
"a lifetime contract."

20:54.920 --> 20:57.673
Oil is very important to America.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.092
Even more important than propane?

21:02.970 --> 21:04.388
Yes, Luanne.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.014
Oil...

21:06.098 --> 21:08.100
...is even more important...

21:08.183 --> 21:09.518
than propane.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.979
I'm so proud of Daddy!

21:12.062 --> 21:15.065
We all are, baby girl. We all are.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.191
-<i>Pee-pee money</i>
<i>is not an employment history.</i>
