WEBVTT

00:14.215 --> 00:16.450
Torres.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.229
Sawyer? What are you
doing here, man?

00:28.329 --> 00:30.498
I thought you were supposed
to be on an undercover op.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.566
If anybody sees us...
They won't.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.803
I was too careful, okay? I just
needed to talk to someone.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.872
All right. What's going on?
Talk to me.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.142
This op-- it's got my head
all turned around.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.943
Being two people,
lying all the time,

00:43.043 --> 00:46.180
constantly having
to look over my shoulder.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.748
Hey.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.783
When was the last time
you slept?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.819
I don't know.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.622
The place
they got me holed up in--

00:54.722 --> 00:57.925
the trains keep me up all night,

00:58.025 --> 00:59.960
just coming and going.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.863
Hey, Dale?
Yeah.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.733
Whose blood is that?

01:05.833 --> 01:10.338
You go too far,
you can still come back, right?

01:11.139 --> 01:12.440
I'm calling Vance, all right?

01:12.540 --> 01:13.974
We need to bring you in now.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.359
It's nothing. We're good.

01:32.126 --> 01:36.230
Sawyer? Sawyer.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.264
What is the national animal
of Scotland?

02:10.364 --> 02:11.932
The unicorn. Correct.

02:12.032 --> 02:16.237
What is the only edible food
that never goes bad?

02:16.337 --> 02:17.638
Honey.
Correct.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.773
What is on the top floor

02:19.873 --> 02:21.875
of the U.S.
Supreme Court building?

02:21.975 --> 02:25.313
Ooh, ooh, wait,
I know this one.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.947
I got it.
A basketball court.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.516
Ah.
Ding, ding, ding!

02:28.616 --> 02:30.351
Correct.
Damn it,
I was gonna say it.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.952
What's with the questions?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.954
Well, our very own Timothy McGee
just found out

02:34.054 --> 02:36.023
that he is going
to be a contestant on

02:36.123 --> 02:37.325
<i>Smart Alecks.</i>

02:37.425 --> 02:38.459
<i>Smart Alecks?</i>

02:38.559 --> 02:39.527
Oh, I love that show.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.894
Everybody loves
that show.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.563
Wow, what's...?
How'd you score that?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.698
Well, it was actually,
uh, Delilah's idea.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.367
Every time
we watch at home,

02:46.467 --> 02:47.801
I play along, usually win,

02:47.901 --> 02:49.437
so she encouraged me
to audition.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.305
Took an online test, and, uh,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.641
they picked me.
When's the show?

02:53.741 --> 02:55.709
Three days. They fly me out
to Hollywood to tape it.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.778
Whoa. I got to say,
I'm impressed, McGee.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.780
You nervous?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.382
Ah, not particularly.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.684
Good, 'cause I'd be terrified.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.952
Being in front
of all those lights

03:05.052 --> 03:06.420
and cameras,
and not to mention,

03:06.520 --> 03:07.755
<i>Smart Alecks</i> is watched

03:07.855 --> 03:09.357
by eight million people?

03:09.457 --> 03:11.191
Mm, I think it's more like ten.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.960
Well, I could
never do it, but

03:13.060 --> 03:14.528
good for you
for not being nervous.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.697
Well, I'm nervous now.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.632
Tell him
it's Agent Torres from NCIS.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.001
It's important. Thanks.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.636
You okay, Nick?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.238
I don't know, man. Sawyer came
to see me last night.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.306
He didn't look good.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.040
Sawyer came to see you?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.843
Aren't the two of you, like,
the opposite of friends?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.379
Well, we had our differences.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.713
That's putting it mildly.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.147
You nearly killed each other

03:34.248 --> 03:35.783
when we busted
that fight club last year.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.486
Well, ever since he took
this undercover assignment,

03:38.586 --> 03:39.987
he's been coming
to me for guidance.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.655
But you should've seen him
last night, man.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.857
He was rambling, edgy,
he had blood on his clothes.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.527
I told him to come in,
but he just took off.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.061
Do you know anything

03:48.161 --> 03:50.230
about this op that he's on?
Can you call his handler?

03:50.331 --> 03:53.334
All I know is that
it's a joint op with the FBI.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.768
They're taking lead.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.804
I reached out
to them twice, and

03:56.904 --> 03:58.105
they haven't
returned my calls.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.573
Do you know
where Sawyer's staying?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.409
No, he's deep undercover.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.777
Only his handler would know.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.750
What's up?
He said that

04:09.850 --> 04:12.219
the trains were keeping him up
at night.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.922
Which maybe means
that he's staying at...

04:15.022 --> 04:16.990
Somewhere near the train tracks.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.561
I got two motels here
near Union Station.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.162
Yeah, I got another two
outside the city.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.997
All right, what are we standing
around here for?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.266
Divide and conquer. Let's go.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.403
Looks like
we found the right place.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.572
Excuse me, Officer.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.541
NCIS. What's going on?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.809
One of the guests called in
a car fire not too long ago.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.811
The firemen are putting it out
right now.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.513
What kind of car is it?
Ford Taurus.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.948
Hope nothing valuable's

04:41.048 --> 04:43.216
in there because
that thing is toast.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.052
That's Sawyer's car.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.360
Captain, was there anyone
in the car?

04:52.460 --> 04:53.761
No.
You check the trunk?

04:53.861 --> 04:56.129
We were just about to.
Do it now, please.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.565
Crowbar.
Mm-hmm.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.014
We're too late.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.795
Can't come
to the phone right now.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.530
You know what to do.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.467
Sawyer's still
not answering.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.869
I can think of one reason why.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.270
Well, we don't know
it's him.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.140
And what about the car?
You said it was his.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.475
Well, lots of people
have the same car.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.411
Doesn't mean anything.
What about his I.D.?

05:43.511 --> 05:45.045
And his prints?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.980
He had no prints.
They were burnt off.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.616
Well, then
we don't know it's him.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.720
I spoke with the motel manager.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.688
He confirmed that
Sawyer was a guest at the motel.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.024
He was registered under
the name Tommy Dugan.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.358
Probably his
undercover alias.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.327
Yeah.
You check his room?

06:00.428 --> 06:02.195
Yeah. There were signs
of a struggle.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.531
Not looking good.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.198
What about
the surveillance cameras?

06:05.298 --> 06:07.134
I haven't checked those yet, but...

06:07.234 --> 06:09.036
Well, then
let's check them out, right?

06:11.839 --> 06:14.542
Why don't you guys, uh,
go get some statements?

06:19.913 --> 06:22.382
What's going on with you?
They're just doing their jobs.

06:22.483 --> 06:26.454
It was supposed to be me
in that trunk.
What?

06:26.554 --> 06:28.789
I was supposed to go on
the undercover op, not Sawyer.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.824
The FBI came to me first.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.326
But I was newly sober, and
I was working on my recovery,

06:33.427 --> 06:35.195
and I turned them down,
all right?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.701
I chose myself before the job.

06:40.801 --> 06:44.071
And now you're thinking, what?
This is somehow your fault?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.874
Don't do that
to yourself, Nick.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.642
You were taking care
of your mental health.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.778
You couldn't have known
that this was gonna happen.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.345
Sawyer wasn't ready for this.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.215
He worked undercover before.
Yeah, but not long-term.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.950
If I would have known
the FBI was gonna ask him,

06:57.050 --> 06:58.452
I would've not turned it down.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.789
Now he's dead,
and I have to live with that.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.691
Our victim here

07:03.791 --> 07:05.526
is not Agent Sawyer.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.394
He's not? What do you mean?

07:07.495 --> 07:09.497
Oh, I was able to extract
some useable DNA and sent it up

07:09.597 --> 07:11.632
to Kasie for analysis,
but then I got to thinking.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.234
I remember one time when I went
out to dinner with Sawyer,

07:14.334 --> 07:16.770
he told me that he'd lost
one of his front teeth

07:16.870 --> 07:18.271
in a fight in high school.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.173
He had to replace it
with an implant.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.043
So, of course,
I X-rayed our victim here,

07:23.143 --> 07:26.113
and sure enough, no implant.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.616
You guys, this isn't Sawyer.

07:28.716 --> 07:29.817
Back up.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.419
You went out to dinner
with Sawyer?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.287
Yeah, you guys are friends?

07:34.387 --> 07:35.723
Well, sure.
We've gone out several times.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.791
I'm telling you,
underneath all that cockiness

07:37.891 --> 07:41.261
and bravado, he's actually
a really sweet guy.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.964
Well, either way,

07:44.064 --> 07:45.766
Torres is gonna be relieved.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.468
Yeah. Well, any idea
who our victim might be?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.804
No, like I said, we're still
waiting on DNA analysis, but

07:50.904 --> 07:53.507
I can tell you that he was shot
to death before he was burned.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.342
I was able
to pull a bullet

07:55.442 --> 07:57.210
out of his chest cavity.
I sent it up

07:57.310 --> 07:59.112
to Kasie for analysis.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.815
So, hopefully, she can
trace that back to our killer.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.618
Well, if this isn't Sawyer,

08:04.718 --> 08:06.620
that means
that he's still missing.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.255
We need to get a BOLO
out immediately.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.323
And reach out
to his handler again.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.560
The FBI still hasn't returned
any of Torres's calls.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.862
I'm guessing they will now.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.730
DNA results
just came back.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.668
Our victim here--
he's an FBI agent.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.673
McCULLERS:
Greg Parlamis was a good agent.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.575
One of the best we've ever had.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.177
Uh, we're sorry about
your man, Agent McCullers.

08:30.277 --> 08:34.715
Thank you, but I assume
this isn't a condolence call.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.584
You must have questions.

08:36.684 --> 08:40.187
A few. Starting with, uh,
what was Parlamis doing

08:40.287 --> 08:42.590
in the trunk
of one of our agents' cars?

08:42.690 --> 08:44.758
Was he undercover with Sawyer?

08:44.858 --> 08:48.161
Yeah. They'd been partnered up
for the last few months.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.463
What were they investigating?

08:50.564 --> 08:52.232
Around six months ago,
a trucker was found shot dead

08:52.332 --> 08:53.701
off the I-95 in Philadelphia.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.936
The contents
of his truck were stolen.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.538
We discovered
it wasn't an isolated incident.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.908
A burglary crew had been robbing
delivery trucks

09:01.008 --> 09:03.110
heading towards naval bases
in the region.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.845
What were they stealing?
Guns? Missiles?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.546
That's the thing.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.316
The trucks were just carrying
random, everyday supplies:

09:09.416 --> 09:12.753
military boots, office chairs,
toilet paper.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.756
So you sent in Sawyer
and Parlamis to check it out?

09:15.856 --> 09:17.891
They went undercover
as truckers.

09:17.991 --> 09:22.229
We thought we were
making headway, but, uh...

09:22.329 --> 09:24.064
What?

09:24.164 --> 09:26.066
We lost contact with them.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.801
They both dropped off the grid.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.536
When was this?

09:30.337 --> 09:31.271
Three weeks ago.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.773
Three weeks ago?

09:33.941 --> 09:34.942
You didn't think
about notifying us?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.376
They were deep undercover.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.845
I wanted
to give them time to resurface.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.447
Three weeks is a lifetime
when you're undercover!

09:40.547 --> 09:42.582
If I remember correctly,
Agent Torres,

09:42.683 --> 09:45.485
I came to you first,
and you turned us down.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.755
So you're in no position
to criticize.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.489
You may be
interested to know

09:49.589 --> 09:51.424
that Sawyer actually
did resurface,

09:51.524 --> 09:53.961
and he visited Torres
last night.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.296
What'd he say?
Not much.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.798
But he looked like
he was in trouble

09:57.898 --> 09:59.366
and he took off before
Torres could bring him in.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.101
He ran?

10:01.201 --> 10:02.670
Yeah. Maybe
his cover was blown.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.504
Maybe that happened
to your man, too.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.974
The thieves got
to Parlamis first,

10:07.074 --> 10:08.575
and now Sawyer's running scared.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.444
Or maybe Sawyer didn't want
to be found.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.680
What are you getting at?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.915
Maybe Sawyer got in too deep,

10:15.015 --> 10:16.750
crossed the line,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.852
did something he didn't want
to do to protect his cover.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.222
Okay, like what,
like kill Agent Parlamis?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.091
When you're undercover,

10:24.191 --> 10:26.694
the line between right and wrong
can get pretty blurry.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.229
No way. Sawyer's a good agent.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.831
He wouldn't do that.

10:30.931 --> 10:34.567
Well, let's hope you're right,
Agent Torres.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.338
Hey, Kasie.
What's all this?

10:38.438 --> 10:41.641
This, McGee, is a distraction.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.611
To help me cope with all the
heaviness surrounding Sawyer,

10:44.712 --> 10:47.480
I decided I am gonna help
you win at <i>Smart Alecks.</i>

10:47.580 --> 10:51.251
Now, I am convinced the key
to winning is your RT,

10:51.351 --> 10:52.686
or reaction time.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.454
You mean, how fast
I can hit the buzzer?

10:54.554 --> 10:55.689
Correct.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.390
Give this man a luggage set.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.392
Okay, Kasie, is there any way
you can just give me an update

10:59.492 --> 11:00.761
on the bullet Jimmy found?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.563
Oh, I will,
but it's going to be in the form

11:03.663 --> 11:05.032
of a game show.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.599
I'll ask the questions,

11:06.700 --> 11:08.736
and I'll time how fast
you buzz in with the answers.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.203
Okay, but
if you're giving me the update,

11:10.303 --> 11:11.371
shouldn't I be the one
asking...?

11:11.471 --> 11:13.373
Let's begin, shall we?

11:15.242 --> 11:16.777
Okay.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.779
The first category is... Ballistics.

11:18.879 --> 11:23.150
This machine is used to catch
and preserve fired bullets.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.617
A bullet trap.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.987
Ooh. Too slow.
Also, you didn't answer

11:27.087 --> 11:28.255
in the form of a question.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.723
They don't do that
on <i>Smart Alecks.</i>

11:29.823 --> 11:31.558
Well, this is my game show,
so roll with it.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.693
Okay, next question.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.963
This tool is considered
the workhorse

11:36.063 --> 11:38.098
in firearms examination.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.767
What is a microscope?

11:39.867 --> 11:42.635
Ooh. The answer
we were looking for is,

11:42.736 --> 11:45.005
"What is
a comparison microscope?"

11:45.105 --> 11:46.439
What?
Sorry.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.741
But your reaction
time's improving,

11:47.841 --> 11:49.209
so it's not a total loss.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.543
Next question.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.245
Okay, Kasie,
I appreciate everything

11:52.345 --> 11:54.081
you're doing here for me, but
do you have an update or not?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.349
No. Still waiting on ballistics.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.450
Okay.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.155
Ooh. Was that your computer
or the game show?

12:02.255 --> 12:04.858
Ballistics are in.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.528
Oh.
What's wrong?

12:08.628 --> 12:10.230
Were you not able to trace
the bullet to our killer?

12:10.330 --> 12:12.532
No, I was, but...

12:14.267 --> 12:15.903
I traced it to Sawyer's gun.

12:16.003 --> 12:19.239
Sawyer might have killed
Agent Parlamis?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.574
Yes.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.118
Sawyer? That can't be right.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.752
Kasie checked twice.

12:32.853 --> 12:36.089
The bullet that killed Agent
Parlamis came from his gun.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.657
That doesn't mean
Sawyer pulled the trigger.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.459
Somebody could've taken his gun
and used it.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.661
Well, true, except
Kasie found Parlamis's prints

12:41.761 --> 12:43.596
all over Sawyer's motel room.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.733
The same room where
we found signs of a struggle.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.568
Oh, doesn't look good.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.470
Maybe Agent McCullers was right.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.207
Maybe Sawyer crossed the line,
went rogue.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.010
Look, Sawyer's a lot of things,
all right, but a killer?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.012
How well do you really know him?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.281
I don't. Hell, I don't
even know if I like the guy.

13:01.381 --> 13:05.052
But last night when he came
to me, he-he was scared.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.753
He was obviously
asking for help.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.889
If he had gone rogue,

13:08.989 --> 13:10.457
why come to me at all?

13:10.557 --> 13:12.159
Well, killer or no,

13:12.259 --> 13:14.461
we need to find him, and fast,
before the FBI does.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.597
Yeah, seriously. With one of
their own dead, they're gonna be

13:17.697 --> 13:18.932
on a manhunt.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.267
Torres, Knight, track down

13:20.367 --> 13:22.335
anyone in Sawyer's family
on the off chance

13:22.435 --> 13:24.071
that he might have
contacted 'em. In the meantime,

13:24.171 --> 13:27.040
McGee and I will retrace
Sawyer's steps, find out more

13:27.140 --> 13:28.508
about this case
he was working on.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.244
Way ahead of you.
I pulled up the FBI file.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.545
Trucks that were targeted

13:32.645 --> 13:34.614
belonged
to the same trucking company--

13:34.714 --> 13:36.149
Hankamer Transports.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.617
They're here in D.C.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.420
Good. Let's get trucking.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.989
Bobby, let's go.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.556
Finish connecting those air
lines, get her out of here.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.892
We got hauling to do.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.660
Annie Hankamer.
You wanted to see me?

13:47.760 --> 13:52.132
Yeah. NCIS. We're, uh,
looking into the truck thefts.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.967
I already told the FBI
everything I know.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.069
What'd they do?
Pass me off to you now?

13:56.803 --> 13:58.471
Something like that. Well,

13:58.571 --> 14:00.473
you better catch whoever's
been robbing my trucks.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.675
Another one just got robbed
two weeks ago.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.144
If it keeps
going like this,

14:04.244 --> 14:05.812
my company's gonna be
in big trouble.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.848
How long you been
running the company for?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.984
About five years now,
since my dad passed.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.752
Business was good.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.487
Till the robberies started?

14:14.587 --> 14:17.257
Yeah. Now half my truckers
aren't even showing up to work.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.992
They're afraid
they're gonna get robbed next.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.228
Navy hasn't pulled
their contract yet,

14:21.328 --> 14:22.795
but it's just a matter of time.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.998
How exactly are the thieves
robbing your trucks?

14:25.098 --> 14:26.833
It's always the same.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.603
They pull up while the truck's
in motion and stop it remotely.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.505
If the thieves can hack
into the truck's computer,

14:32.605 --> 14:34.507
they can essentially
control the truck.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.543
What happens after that?

14:36.643 --> 14:38.578
The thieves restrain the driver,
then they detach the trailer

14:38.678 --> 14:41.448
and reattach it to one of their
own tractors and drive away.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.650
These thieves--
they are smart and fast.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.685
They're in and out
in less than ten minutes.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.855
You thinking
this could be an inside job?

14:48.956 --> 14:51.358
You tell me. You're the cop.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.229
Mrs. Sawyer,
thank you for coming in.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.698
I'm Agent Knight,
this is Agent Torres.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.733
Nick Torres?

15:00.833 --> 15:01.935
Yes, ma'am.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.471
My son has told me
a lot about you.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.506
Hmm. Any of it good?

15:06.606 --> 15:08.708
Define "good."

15:09.709 --> 15:11.211
Yeah.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.746
Uh, Mrs. Sawyer, when was
the last time you saw your son?

15:13.846 --> 15:16.349
What's wrong?

15:16.449 --> 15:18.385
Something's happened to Dale,
hasn't it?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.753
We're just looking
for him at the moment.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.555
I knew it.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.692
The day he came by the house, I
knew there was something wrong.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.160
When was that?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.162
About a month ago.

15:29.262 --> 15:33.066
Dale stopped by unexpectedly,
which is very unlike Dale.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.068
And how was his mental state?

15:35.168 --> 15:37.137
Was he agitated, upset?

15:37.237 --> 15:39.906
He seemed down.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.541
He didn't say much.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.644
But at the time, I thought
it was because that day

15:44.744 --> 15:46.779
had been the anniversary
of Kara's death.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.315
Who's Kara?

15:48.415 --> 15:51.251
Kara's Dale's younger sister.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.088
She died five years ago.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.724
I'm sorry.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.126
We didn't know.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.428
Dale doesn't like
to talk about it.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.997
He and Kara
were very close.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.034
Her death totally decimated him.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.302
Other than that visit,

16:09.402 --> 16:12.039
did Dale, uh, ever
contact you again?

16:12.139 --> 16:14.374
Text, phone?

16:15.175 --> 16:17.877
There was that one time
last week.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.879
But it was such a brief call.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.814
Strange, really.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.683
How so?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.218
He called late at night,

16:25.318 --> 16:26.986
suddenly out of the blue,

16:27.087 --> 16:29.056
to tell me he loved me.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.224
Then he said he had to go.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.026
I remember
I had trouble hearing him

16:33.126 --> 16:35.995
because there was all this
loud music in the background and

16:36.096 --> 16:37.997
weird noises.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.232
Weird?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.134
It sounded like an animal.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.603
Like an animal...

16:43.703 --> 16:45.438
grunting.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.376
<i>The over-under is</i>

16:49.476 --> 16:51.778
four answers right, no vig,
and there's a prop bet

16:51.878 --> 16:54.013
on what color tie
the host will be wearing.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.183
You in?

16:58.151 --> 17:00.187
Good luck.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.290
What was that?

17:04.291 --> 17:07.060
Is there a betting pool
on how I'll do in <i>Smart Alecks?</i>

17:07.160 --> 17:08.561
This was not my idea.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.797
I am just the bookie.
I don't believe this.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.299
Does everyone
in this building know

17:12.399 --> 17:13.600
that I'm gonna be on this show?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.135
More like everyone

17:15.235 --> 17:16.669
in the entire Navy Yard.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.071
Don't worry.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.073
You are heavily favored to win.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.542
I've got a hundred
riding on you, too.

17:22.642 --> 17:26.713
Well, thanks, but are people
actively betting against me?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.449
It's not a knock against you, McGee.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.884
It's just
that you are going up against

17:31.984 --> 17:33.786
five-time winner
Russell Mishkin,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.155
and he is

17:35.255 --> 17:37.424
the Ken Jennings
of <i>Smart Alecks.</i>

17:37.524 --> 17:39.359
McGee's gonna wipe the floor
with that guy.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.860
Appreciate that, Parker.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.662
Where we at on the case?

17:42.762 --> 17:45.898
I reviewed the cargo manifests
from the targeted trucks,

17:45.998 --> 17:47.667
and Agent McCullers was right.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.103
Everything
that the thieves stole

17:50.203 --> 17:51.938
was random, innocuous items.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.040
Ah, so maybe they're, uh,
they're turning 'em around,

17:54.141 --> 17:55.675
selling 'em on
the black market.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.011
Nah, this stuff wouldn't be
worth the hassle of stealing.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.314
I did find
one interesting pattern.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.316
All of the trucks were carrying
B1 vitamins,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.585
like crates of them.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.786
Vitamins?

18:06.886 --> 18:09.622
Okay, what about, uh,
what our truck lady

18:09.722 --> 18:11.258
Ms. Hankamer said?

18:11.358 --> 18:13.793
Could this be an inside job,
someone looking to rip her off?

18:13.893 --> 18:15.495
Possibly. We checked

18:15.595 --> 18:16.929
her company's employee records,

18:17.029 --> 18:18.465
and we found someone
who might fit the bill.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.901
Wade Cutler. He's been
driving for Hankamer

18:22.001 --> 18:23.236
for the past four years.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.737
And before that,
he did time

18:24.837 --> 18:26.873
for robbery and grand
theft auto. And get this.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.642
Each day of the robberies,
he called in sick.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.111
All right.
So where do we find Wade Cutler?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.546
I may have an idea.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.749
There's a roadhouse
off of, uh, I-95

18:36.849 --> 18:39.152
called the Triple Deuce.
Popular with truckers.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.653
I'm willing to bet

18:40.753 --> 18:42.655
that that's where
Wade hangs out,

18:42.755 --> 18:44.157
and that Sawyer's been there, too.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.492
Why do you think that?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.260
Well, Sawyer's mom.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.828
She said that he called

18:48.928 --> 18:51.564
from a place with loud music
and animal grunts.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.866
And so, I called the
Triple Deuce, and it turns out

18:53.966 --> 18:56.603
they have a mechanical bull
that makes noises.

18:56.703 --> 19:00.507
So, are we going on a field trip
to the Triple Deuce?

19:00.607 --> 19:02.309
We can't.
If Wade is our thief,

19:02.409 --> 19:03.910
we can't go in there
flashing badges.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.245
It'll tip him off.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.347
It could endanger Sawyer,

19:07.447 --> 19:08.781
if he's still alive
and undercover.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.883
Mm, so how do we investigate somebody

19:10.983 --> 19:12.319
who we can't investigate?

19:12.419 --> 19:14.020
I know how.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.322
No way.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.923
I go undercover
and I get close to Wade.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.858
No, it's too dangerous.
McGEE:
No, I agree with Parker.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.228
Going undercover already
got one agent killed.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.795
It's the only way
to find Sawyer.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.297
Okay, it's got to be me.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.400
I'm the reason why he's
in this mess in the first place.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.073
Okay, I'll get started with
Kasie on creating a backstop.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.475
And I'll dig up

19:35.575 --> 19:37.910
whatever I can on Wade Cutler.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.816
You sure about this, Nick?

19:43.916 --> 19:46.853
I think it's time
to put my job first.

20:06.606 --> 20:10.677
Uh, I'll have
a Cran-Apple, plain.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.547
Friend of Bill, huh?
Yeah, I just met him.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.683
I got eight years myself.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.418
Hmm.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.788
It's on the house, honey.

20:21.888 --> 20:22.955
Thank you.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.095
So, you got a name to go with
that handsome face of yours?

20:29.195 --> 20:31.598
Danny.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.633
Everybody here
calls me Mama Jo.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.336
Mama Jo.
I own this dump.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.170
So what brings you here, Danny?

20:38.271 --> 20:41.741
I haven't seen you before,
and I know everybody.

20:41.841 --> 20:45.211
Oh, I just came up
from the, uh, Panhandle.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.113
Doing some trucking down there?

20:47.213 --> 20:49.516
Yeah, I was driving
an Anteater, pulling doubles,

20:49.616 --> 20:52.419
lots of long hauls,
and, uh, then things dried up.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.020
You and the rest
of the country.

20:54.120 --> 20:58.190
I'm actually looking
to make some quick cash.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.093
Heard through the grapevine
that I should come out here

21:01.193 --> 21:03.363
and ask for a guy named Wade.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.665
Where'd you hear that?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.133
Was I talking to you?

21:07.233 --> 21:08.901
You are now.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.538
Who told you about Wade?

21:11.638 --> 21:13.039
Screw you, man.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.741
Isn't there a cow somewhere
that needs tipping?

21:18.745 --> 21:22.181
Hey, hombre, why don't you take
that smart mouth of yours

21:22.281 --> 21:23.583
and get the hell out of here?

21:23.683 --> 21:26.218
Leave him alone, Emmet!
Wow.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.688
Hombre.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.166
We have a problem here?

21:40.266 --> 21:42.402

22:16.669 --> 22:18.137
That's five.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.476
He was asking about you.
Bastard damn near
broke my nose.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.579
Yeah, well, it would have
been an improvement.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.314
Here's his wallet.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.919
Well, what do we got here?

22:33.019 --> 22:35.321
Danny Rico from Florida.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.959
What do you want, Mr. Rico?

22:40.059 --> 22:41.928
I need to make some fast cash.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.163
Do I look like
I sell lotto tickets?

22:44.263 --> 22:46.533
You got a trucker's license.
Use it.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.568
I need something more lucrative.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.037
Something off the books.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.806
I have some issues with the law.

22:53.906 --> 22:57.309
Hmm. You've done time? Where?

22:57.410 --> 22:58.611
Glades.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.480
Did about a dime
for armed robbery.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.214
I bunked with a dude
named Foley,

23:02.314 --> 23:06.753
who told me that, uh,
you guys had something going.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.955
Foley?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.723
Never heard of him.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.659
I know him.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.563
We pulled some scores
together back in the day.

23:16.663 --> 23:19.031
He's good people.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.868
If Foley can vouch for this guy,
he must be okay.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.638
You come in here
acting all tough.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.339
How do I know you're not a cop?

23:27.440 --> 23:28.808
I look like a cop?

23:28.908 --> 23:30.877
Actually, yeah, you do.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.779
Check him for a wire.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.483
Get your hands off me.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.521
Nobody step closer,
or I'll cut it off!

23:42.855 --> 23:44.390
I'm not playing.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.897
Oh, I like this guy.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.765
Yeah, he's crazier
than you, Emmet.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.801
Yeah.

23:54.901 --> 23:58.304
Okay, Danny Rico of Florida.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.577
I'm gonna make a few calls.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.715
If you are
who you say you are, well,

24:08.815 --> 24:10.917
then maybe we'll have something
for you in the near future.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.119
So, we'll be in touch.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.421
When? I need cash now.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.156
Don't be so impatient.

24:17.256 --> 24:20.226
It's bad for your health.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.063
Oh, I thought
you might need a double

24:24.163 --> 24:27.033
after meeting Wade.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.035
His boys can be
a real handful.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.803
Yeah, not the word I'd use.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.605
Sorry about the fight earlier.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.473
Oh, don't sweat it, handsome.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.509
Emmet had it coming.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.978
Speaking of...

24:46.418 --> 24:47.587
Whiskey, Mama Jo.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.022
10-4.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.639
Where's your bathroom?

25:06.739 --> 25:08.608
Just down the hall.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.815
What the hell are
you doing here?

25:15.915 --> 25:17.249
What am I'm doing here?
Looking for you.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.518
You could've blown my cover. Sawyer,

25:19.619 --> 25:20.853
what's going on here?

25:20.953 --> 25:22.421
Everyone's looking for you.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.691
People think
you killed that FBI agent--

25:24.791 --> 25:27.159
Parlamis.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.564
Oh, man.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.432
You <i>did</i> kill him.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.834
I had no choice.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.837
He was an agent.
A dirty agent.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.840
He was stealing money from Wade
and keeping it for himself.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.408
When I confronted
him at the motel,

25:42.508 --> 25:44.543
he got angry and
went for his gun.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.078
So I shot him.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.680
It was self-defense.

25:47.780 --> 25:51.618
Sawyer, did you burn his body?

25:51.718 --> 25:53.185
No.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.822
That was Wade's idea.
He stopped by the motel,

25:55.922 --> 25:57.289
he got all suspicious,

25:57.389 --> 25:59.592
and asked me why
I killed him. I...

25:59.692 --> 26:03.663
So you told him you figured out
that Parlamis was an FBI agent

26:03.763 --> 26:06.733
and you killed him
because he was being a rat?

26:07.533 --> 26:10.269
I had
to protect my cover, right?

26:11.771 --> 26:13.673
This mission is over.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.474
I'm bringing you back in.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.944
We have plenty of evidence
to take down Wade and his crew.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.046
Except Wade's not
calling the shots.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.381
He's got a boss, a big fish.

26:22.481 --> 26:23.950
I overheard Wade talking
to him on the phone.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.384
Look, I haven't met him yet,

26:25.484 --> 26:27.486
but I'm getting close.
I just need more time.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.588
I don't know. I think we need
to call the FBI first.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.123
Please, Nick.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.925
I have devoted months to this,

26:33.025 --> 26:34.460
literally given up my life.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.630
You, of all people,
know what that's like.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.532
Let me see this through.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.602
All right.

26:43.703 --> 26:46.238
I'll call Parker and tell him
that we're staying undercover.

26:46.338 --> 26:47.840
We?

26:47.940 --> 26:50.209
No way. This is my mission.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.978
I've got this under control.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.780
Control?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.882
You didn't seem that in control
back in the alley.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.284
Look, everything had just
gone down with Parlamis, okay?

26:58.384 --> 27:00.687
My head wasn't screwed on
straight, but I'm good now.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.855
Yeah, well,
I'm not taking any chances.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.558
Hey, Parker.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.661
Uh... might
fade too much.
All right.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.697
Yeah, let's-let's go
with this one.
McGEE: Hey, guys.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.965
What you got there, Jimmy?
Buy some new neckties?

27:13.065 --> 27:15.134
Actually, these are
for you, McGee.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.435
We are picking
the perfect tie

27:16.535 --> 27:18.037
for you to wear
on <i>Smart Alecks.</i>

27:18.137 --> 27:19.706
What's wrong with my clothes?

27:19.806 --> 27:21.708
Oh, nothing. You just need
something that's bold, you know?

27:21.808 --> 27:24.176
Something that'll intimidate
the other contestants.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.312
Mm-hmm. So we came up
with the perfect

27:26.412 --> 27:28.314
power color... for you.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.082
How do you feel about...

27:30.182 --> 27:31.918
chartreuse?
Hmm.

27:32.018 --> 27:34.086
Look, I know you guys
are just trying to help,

27:34.186 --> 27:37.423
okay, but I just want to go
on <i>Smart Alecks</i> and have fun.

27:37.523 --> 27:40.292
All this talk about power colors
and betting pools--

27:40.392 --> 27:42.528
it's kind of got me freaked out
a little bit, so...

27:42.628 --> 27:46.165
Oh. We're sorry.
Uh, yeah, we'll stop.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.034
Oh, it's okay.
It's all right. It's...

27:48.801 --> 27:50.169
Although,

27:50.269 --> 27:52.138
you know what?
This one looks really nice.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.106
It does, doesn't it?

27:54.206 --> 27:55.708
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.177
Oh. I can almost feel my power.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.946
Mm.
Where'd you get
this one, Jimmy?

28:00.046 --> 28:01.480
Got it from downstairs.

28:01.580 --> 28:02.882
Down? Wait.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.383
You got this off
one of the bodies?

28:04.483 --> 28:06.452
Oh, sure. I got a whole
wardrobe down there.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.755
Uh, they're not
gonna miss it.
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

28:08.855 --> 28:11.623
Oh, nice tie.
Got one just like it at home.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.160
Anyone talk to Torres
since last night?

28:14.260 --> 28:15.527
He called in
about an hour ago.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.964
Wade Cutler bought
his cover story.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.265
So it would appear
that Torres has

28:19.365 --> 28:20.800
successfully infiltrated
his crew.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.202
Any word on when they're gonna
pull the next heist?

28:23.302 --> 28:24.904
Not yet, but, uh,
Torres is hoping

28:25.004 --> 28:26.405
when they do,
Mr. Big will be there.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.407
Uh, I got to be honest.

28:28.507 --> 28:31.077
I still don't like the idea
of Torres staying undercover.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.611
Look, the best thing we can do

28:32.711 --> 28:34.480
to help both of 'em is
just keep working the case.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.917
We need to figure out exactly
what Wade wants on those trucks.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.586
Actually, I might have an idea.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.857
But you're not gonna believe it.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.458
They're stealing
the vitamins?

28:46.558 --> 28:48.094
You're right.
I don't believe it.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.896
Vitamins-- we all take 'em,
we all love 'em.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.730
They're good
for your health, right?
Yeah, sure.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.333
I used to love the ones that
looked like Fred and Barney.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.837
But did you know
that B1 vitamins

28:57.937 --> 29:00.907
contain trace amounts
of a chemical called

29:01.007 --> 29:03.342
gamma-butyrolactone, or GBL?

29:03.442 --> 29:05.211
Now, GBL by itself

29:05.311 --> 29:07.646
is illegal
to consumers in the U.S.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.782
because it is
the main ingredient in GHB,

29:09.882 --> 29:11.550
the date-rape drug.

29:11.650 --> 29:14.220
Wade and his crew are stealing
the vitamins

29:14.320 --> 29:16.222
so they can make drugs?

29:16.322 --> 29:18.925
They're not just thieves.
They're drug dealers.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.426
They need a ton of the vitamins

29:20.526 --> 29:22.161
in order to extract
the necessary chemical.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.030
Nice job, Kase.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.731
Th-There's something else.

29:25.832 --> 29:28.600
I wasn't the only one
interested in these vitamins.

29:28.700 --> 29:32.538
Someone else at NCIS pulled the
same chemical analysis reports

29:32.638 --> 29:33.940
three weeks ago.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.075
Who?

29:44.150 --> 29:45.818
So, what's the deal?
Wade wants us there

29:45.918 --> 29:47.386
at 2:00 p.m. Saturday.
All right, got it.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.655
All right, we'll see you.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.135
Hey.
Hey.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.937
Emmet told me
something's going down soon.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.373
Said he was gonna call us.
Well, good timing.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.075
I just got off
the phone with Parker.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.776
What did he have to say?

30:10.877 --> 30:13.412
Well, Kasie figured out what
Wade and his crew were up to.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.147
They're making drugs.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.316
GHB.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.585
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

30:19.685 --> 30:21.353
What are you...?

30:21.453 --> 30:22.955
You ran the chemical reports
three weeks ago.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.323
And don't even bother denying it

30:24.423 --> 30:26.758
'cause Kasie found your log-ins.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.260
I was gonna tell you.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.728
Yeah. When?
When I was ready.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.563
I'm still trying
to put the pieces together.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.332
That's not good enough.
You should've come to me sooner.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.334
Yeah, well, this is my mission,

30:35.434 --> 30:37.036
and I don't have
to answer to you.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.571
Yeah, you're right.
You don't answer to me,

30:39.671 --> 30:42.975
but you do answer
to Vance and the FBI.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.644
You should've at least
given them the heads-up.

30:45.744 --> 30:47.880
Ah, forget this, man.
Hey, Sawyer.

30:49.081 --> 30:52.251
What else are you hiding
from me now? Huh?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.487
Where you going?
To the head.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.225
Is that okay, or you want
to tag along there, too?

31:13.205 --> 31:15.474
Doesn't feel good, does it?

31:30.689 --> 31:33.725
Talk.
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

31:33.825 --> 31:36.595
For starters,
or maybe I should arrest you

31:36.695 --> 31:39.531
for obstruction of justice, hmm?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.002
I want to know the reason why

31:43.102 --> 31:45.537
you've been keeping secrets
on this case.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.406
The real reason.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.214
It's because of Kara.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.316
Your sister?

31:57.416 --> 32:01.087
She died from GHB.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.824
What happened?

32:05.924 --> 32:08.194
Oh, she was partying too much

32:08.294 --> 32:10.429
and fell in
with the wrong crowd.

32:10.529 --> 32:16.268
And... one night she bought
some GHB and overdosed.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.238
It put her in a coma.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.941
You know, she held on
for six months.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.114
Those were the longest months
of my life.

32:28.214 --> 32:30.249
I'm sorry.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.552
Did they catch the guys
who sold it to her?

32:33.652 --> 32:35.054
No.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.056
Then, when I took this case
and learned

32:37.156 --> 32:39.758
that Wade and his crew were
selling the same poison

32:39.858 --> 32:41.760
that killed my sister?

32:41.860 --> 32:43.895
I had to stop them.

32:43.996 --> 32:47.133
That's why you didn't tell
the FBI about the drugs.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.169
So what now?

32:55.307 --> 32:57.009
Look, Sawyer,

32:57.109 --> 33:00.346
I know this is
personal to you,

33:00.446 --> 33:04.283
but going rogue is not
the way to go about it.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.285
Trust me.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.820
I know.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.689
When I first
joined here years ago,

33:10.789 --> 33:13.259
somebody came
after my family.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.895
I nearly lost it, man.

33:16.995 --> 33:20.166
Almost took matters
into my own hands.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.468
What stopped you?

33:22.568 --> 33:24.803
My team.

33:24.903 --> 33:27.939
They made me realize
I wasn't alone

33:28.040 --> 33:29.875
and that I could
lean on them for support.

33:29.975 --> 33:32.411
But not everyone has
what you have.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.414
Your team is special.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.050
What do I got?

33:38.150 --> 33:41.787
Me. You can lean on me, man.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.326
Ah.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.530
It's Wade.

33:51.630 --> 33:52.898
Looks like it's showtime.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.433
They're pulling another heist?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.968
No. Wade wants to move the drugs

33:57.069 --> 33:58.970
to a new location
in a couple hours.

33:59.071 --> 34:02.208
Says the big boss
is gonna be there.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.076
That doesn't give us much time.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.980
Hey, Parker.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.049
Where are we at?

34:11.150 --> 34:13.852
After your call with Torres,
we placed GPS trackers

34:13.952 --> 34:16.155
on his and Sawyer's trucks.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.124
Wherever they go, we'll know.

34:18.224 --> 34:21.393
What about the drugs? We have
any idea of their location yet?

34:21.493 --> 34:22.861
Wade wants
them to meet

34:22.961 --> 34:24.863
at the roadhouse first
to get the details.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.398
But once they get
to the second location

34:26.498 --> 34:28.134
and Torres can confirm
that the drugs are there,

34:28.234 --> 34:30.102
he's gonna text us,
we go in, make the bust.

34:30.202 --> 34:34.106
Okay, good. I want eyes on
Torres and Sawyer at all times.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.881
Where's Wade?

34:42.981 --> 34:44.316
Change of plans.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.917
Wade's gonna meet us
at the location.

34:46.017 --> 34:48.086
All right, fine by me.
We'll follow you.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.122
No, you won't be needing
your trucks. I'll drive.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.358
But first I'm gonna need
your cell phones.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.559
What for?

34:53.659 --> 34:55.527
The boss likes
to take precautions.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.063
You never know
who's listening, right?

34:58.164 --> 34:59.865
Hmm.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.201
Hell, you know me.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.002
I don't care.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.872
I'm not giving you crap.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.409
Don't make this tougher
than it needs to be,

35:10.509 --> 35:12.544
Rico.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.388
Shall we?

35:37.068 --> 35:39.171
Where's the stuff?

35:39.271 --> 35:42.107
Yeah, I thought we were gonna
move some merchandize.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.143
Not today, handsome.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.481
Ah.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.450
So you call the shots
around here?

35:51.550 --> 35:53.285
Don't look so surprised.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.754
You think I made
all my money

35:55.854 --> 35:57.823
slinging beers for truckers?

35:57.923 --> 36:00.091
I did. I kinda did.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.494
Hell, I should be the one
who's surprised.

36:02.594 --> 36:06.965
A handsome guy like you
turning out to be a cop.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.100
Uh, okay, I don't...

36:09.201 --> 36:10.769
One of the working girls
who hooks at the Deuce?

36:10.869 --> 36:13.972
She also happens to work
at the motel Tommy's staying at.

36:15.073 --> 36:16.475
She recognized you
from the crime scene.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.344
Said she saw you there

36:18.444 --> 36:20.512
with a bunch of cops
asking questions.

36:20.612 --> 36:24.450
Got anything to say
for yourself, Danny Rico?

36:24.550 --> 36:28.487
Or should I say
Agent Nick Torres?

36:28.587 --> 36:30.489
Put him on his knees.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.359
All right, hold up,
hold up.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.661
There's got
to be some mistake here.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.963
Now, Rico's no cop.
My prison guy vouched for him.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.731
Who vouched for you?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.132
I've had my doubts about you

36:41.233 --> 36:42.901
the minute
you showed up at the Deuce.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.003
So now I'm a cop?

36:45.103 --> 36:48.006
We never had any rats
until you showed up.

36:48.106 --> 36:50.976
Now, all of a sudden,
we've got two?

36:51.076 --> 36:53.345
Yeah, it's a hell
of a coincidence.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.281
Are you crazy?!

36:55.381 --> 36:57.182
Are you forgetting
what happened at the motel?

36:57.283 --> 36:58.817
I killed one of those rats.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.920
Well, then you'll have
no trouble killing this one.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.655
Shoot him.

37:05.190 --> 37:08.394
If you're not a cop, prove it.

37:24.676 --> 37:27.979
NCIS! You're under arrest!

37:31.983 --> 37:33.519
I had a feeling you'd do that.

37:33.619 --> 37:37.323
Which is why we took all of
the bullets out of the gun.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.696
Get down!

37:44.796 --> 37:47.165
End of the road, boys.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.501
No hard feelings.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.671
Something funny, handsome?

37:52.771 --> 37:54.473
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.343
Can't wait to see the look
in your dumbass faces

37:57.443 --> 38:00.746
when a team of federal agents
just busts through that door.

38:02.381 --> 38:05.016
And, uh, how do you suppose
that's gonna happen, huh?

38:05.116 --> 38:07.886
No one knows you're here.
We took your phones.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.220
And I took yours.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.656
I picked your pocket

38:10.756 --> 38:12.458
back at the bar
when I bumped into you,

38:12.558 --> 38:16.127
and I secretly dialed NCIS
on the way here, so, uh,

38:16.227 --> 38:18.196
well, they should've tracked
my location by now.

38:20.666 --> 38:21.633
Hombre.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.234
Son of a bi...

38:24.169 --> 38:25.771
NCIS!
Freeze! Right there!

38:25.871 --> 38:26.972
FBI!

38:27.072 --> 38:29.708
Hands up!
Hands! Let's see hands!

38:29.808 --> 38:31.510
We got 'em!

39:01.607 --> 39:05.611
Hey, you really improved
since we last fought.

39:05.711 --> 39:08.514
Oh. You, too.

39:08.614 --> 39:11.049
I'm still better, though.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.951
Come on. Ow.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.653
Ow.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.226
Well, I wish you'd let me

39:21.326 --> 39:22.861
give you the full
check-up downstairs.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.497
You two look like you've been
in a cage match... again.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.566
We're fine, Jimmy. Thank you.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.901
Yeah, you should see
the other guys.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.703
No, like, seriously.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.439
They definitely need
medical attention.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.542
It's just nice
to see the two of you

39:36.642 --> 39:38.577
fighting someone else
for a change. Yeah.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.178
Welcome back. Well,

39:40.278 --> 39:42.814
we got a full confession
from, uh, Mama Jo Dalton.

39:42.914 --> 39:46.117
She gave up the location of the
drugs, accomplices, everything.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.853
Are the drugs off the streets?

39:47.953 --> 39:50.622
They won't be able
to hurt anybody else again.

39:52.424 --> 39:55.494
Hey, Torres, can we, uh...?

40:01.567 --> 40:03.535
Listen, I just wanted to...

40:03.635 --> 40:07.839
Listen, man, no, no, no. No, uh,
reason to thank me, all right?

40:07.939 --> 40:10.208
Told you I had your back,
and I meant it.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.778
Only did
what you would have done for me.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.212
Actually, I was gonna ask

40:14.312 --> 40:15.847
if you could fill out
those action reports.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.249
No use in us both doing 'em.

40:19.718 --> 40:23.321
This... guy right here.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.757
Hey, I had you, didn't I?

40:25.857 --> 40:29.160
Yeah, I don't even know why
I deal with you, man.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.563
Seriously, though, Nick,

40:31.663 --> 40:34.900
thank you... for everything.

40:35.701 --> 40:38.436
Well, don't be afraid
to reach out next time.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.674
You're not alone.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.517
McGee? What are you doing here?

40:51.617 --> 40:53.184
Yeah, shouldn't you be
on your way to Hollywood by now?

40:53.284 --> 40:56.187
Well, I got a call from
the producers of <i>Smart Alecks.</i>

40:56.287 --> 40:58.389
It appears
that five-time winner

40:58.490 --> 41:01.192
Russell Mishkin...
was caught cheating.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.662
So they have halted production

41:03.762 --> 41:05.230
while they conduct
an investigation.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.332
I knew Mishkin was
too good to be true.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.034
I'm sorry to hear it, McGee.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.503
Yeah, we all know how much you
were looking forward to this.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.338
Yeah, just kind of bummed
I don't get

41:13.438 --> 41:15.807
to show off my trivia knowledge,
you know?

41:16.808 --> 41:18.710
Not necessarily.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.111
McGEE: Milk of Magnesia.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.479
What?
That's correct.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.248
Is that for real?
That's it, yes, that's it.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.817
Okay, next question,
for 50 points.

41:26.752 --> 41:29.287
How many hearts
does an octopus have?

41:29.387 --> 41:30.556
Three.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.157
Oh.
What?!
That's correct!

41:32.257 --> 41:33.224
Oh, come on!

41:33.324 --> 41:34.560
It's impossible! This guy--

41:34.660 --> 41:36.628
he's like the
Terminator of Trivia.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.564
All right, I'm done.
I trained him.
I trained him.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.165
Jimmy, you get
up here and lose.
All right, all right.

41:40.265 --> 41:41.166
Come on, man.
I'll give it a go.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.568
Next victim.
Be nice.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.002
Brutal.
Thank you very much.

41:44.102 --> 41:46.037
Um, I got it, I got it.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.140
Come on, Jimmy, represent.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.141
Here we go.

41:50.241 --> 41:51.977
Yas!

41:52.811 --> 41:54.345
I'm pissed, I don't
like losing.

41:54.445 --> 41:55.781
Hey, Sawyer. What's up, man?

41:55.881 --> 41:58.516
I was just wondering
if you had room for one more?

41:58.617 --> 42:01.086
But, you know, if it's just
a you-and-your-team thing,

42:01.186 --> 42:02.954
it's cool, I understand.

42:03.054 --> 42:06.725
Well, that depends.
Do you have pepperoni in there?

42:06.825 --> 42:08.126
With extra cheese.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.228
All right, get your ass in here.

42:10.328 --> 42:11.930
All right, we got a new player.
