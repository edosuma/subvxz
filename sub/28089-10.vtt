<i>Previously on</i> Doom Patrol...

00:22.059 --> 00:23.963
<i>What's the
Bureau of Normalcy?</i>

00:23.995 --> 00:27.565
<i>It's a top secret government agency,
run by a bunch of demented zealots.</i>

00:27.597 --> 00:30.234
<i>They stomp out anything
they deem to be aberrations.</i>

00:30.268 --> 00:33.337
<i>Hey, it's me. Jane.</i>

00:33.368 --> 00:36.606
<i>Her brain activity's
off the charts, and yet... nothing.</i>

00:36.640 --> 00:37.841
<i>Jane's in there somewhere.</i>

00:40.911 --> 00:42.545
What the hell happened here?

00:42.579 --> 00:43.779
Long story.

00:43.780 --> 00:46.715
If you're feeling homicidal urges,
just gives us a little heads up, all right?

00:46.716 --> 00:47.817
I said, shut up.

00:47.850 --> 00:49.430
- I was trying to protect you.
- By lying?

00:49.454 --> 00:51.756
<i>How did Niles get
involved with superheroes?</i>

00:51.786 --> 00:52.823
Niles never said.

00:52.856 --> 00:54.591
You know he has his secrets.

00:54.625 --> 00:55.826
Niles and his secrets.

00:55.859 --> 01:00.859
Sounds like you and I know
two different Niles Caulders.

02:12.770 --> 02:16.973
<i>From the Journal of Niles
Caulder, 4th of December, 1913.</i>

02:17.008 --> 02:22.008
<i>We've set up north on an exploratory
mission for the Bureau of Oddities.</i>

02:22.312 --> 02:25.382
<i>Washington doubts
our department's value,</i>

02:25.414 --> 02:29.117
<i>but I am eager to prove
what we are capable of.</i>

02:34.758 --> 02:36.393
Steady on, Alistair.

02:36.425 --> 02:38.461
We're explorers,
not mercenaries.

02:38.495 --> 02:41.031
You tell that to the
Turks that were just up this way

02:41.062 --> 02:43.664
about seven months ago.

02:43.699 --> 02:46.870
Only one man returned.

02:46.902 --> 02:48.405
Barely.

02:48.437 --> 02:50.840
You know what
he claims he saw?

02:50.872 --> 02:53.074
Those men were hunters.

02:53.110 --> 02:55.578
We're not.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.715
If this creature exists,

02:57.747 --> 03:00.318
there's no reason to believe
it's gonna be of any danger to us.

03:00.348 --> 03:04.152
In fact, it might mean us
no harm at all.

03:09.961 --> 03:12.429
Oh, friend.

03:12.461 --> 03:16.133
Anything that can survive
this frozen hell

03:16.164 --> 03:20.967
absolutely
wants to do you harm.

04:34.211 --> 04:39.211
You remind that wolf
that you're an explorer,

04:39.249 --> 04:42.620
- not a hunter.
- You saved my life.

04:42.653 --> 04:45.254
I thought I told you not to
wander away from camp without...

04:49.559 --> 04:53.831
Alistair!

04:53.862 --> 04:56.112
Run!

05:44.112 --> 05:46.083
No.

05:46.117 --> 05:48.785
Wait. Please.

05:48.819 --> 05:50.187
No.

05:50.220 --> 05:51.754
Please.

05:51.788 --> 05:54.487
Please.

06:15.345 --> 06:18.382
Ernest, are you down there?

06:18.415 --> 06:20.016
What is it, Mother?

06:20.050 --> 06:22.254
We're out of Lean Cuisine.

06:22.286 --> 06:25.389
I no longer require Lean Cuisine
for sustenance, Mother.

06:25.422 --> 06:26.790
I maintain my physique

06:26.824 --> 06:29.894
through a high-calorie
ketogenic diet and mental focus.

06:29.927 --> 06:33.564
I need you to go to the market.

06:33.596 --> 06:34.898
What?

06:34.932 --> 06:36.333
Why?

06:36.367 --> 06:37.766
Why can't you go?

06:37.802 --> 06:39.836
I'm watching <i>This Is Us.</i>

06:39.869 --> 06:41.939
Fuck <i>This Is Us.</i>

06:41.973 --> 06:44.641
The keys are by the door.

06:44.675 --> 06:47.978
And don't forget to pick
up more scratchers.

06:48.011 --> 06:49.846
Mama!

06:49.879 --> 06:53.480
I'm very busy right now!

06:56.052 --> 06:58.288
Mom?

06:58.322 --> 07:03.059
Mom!

07:03.093 --> 07:04.595
Mom!

07:36.627 --> 07:41.165
Canned peaches are on
aisle five, old-timer.

07:58.348 --> 08:00.184
That's for my mom.

08:00.218 --> 08:03.922
That's for me.

08:03.954 --> 08:06.857
We know all about your
hemorrhoid cream preferences,

08:06.891 --> 08:09.290
Ernest Franklin.

08:15.463 --> 08:17.000
Who the fuck are you?

08:17.035 --> 08:21.237
Try The United States fucking Government.
Bureau of Normalcy.

08:21.271 --> 08:22.540
I'm familiar
with your work.

08:22.574 --> 08:24.341
No, you're not.

08:24.374 --> 08:26.011
No, I'm not.

08:26.043 --> 08:28.312
Normally, the Bureau
operates in the shadows,

08:28.345 --> 08:29.879
entirely self-regulated.

08:29.915 --> 08:34.913
But desperate times
call for... people like you.

08:35.317 --> 08:36.351
People like me?

08:36.384 --> 08:38.620
One of our top agents,
Darren Jones,

08:38.653 --> 08:40.191
failed to report in
from assignment.

08:40.192 --> 08:42.524
We believe that he had an
encounter with the associates

08:42.557 --> 08:44.826
of a gentleman by the name
of Niles Caulder.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.931
We believe that a man
of your... talents

08:47.932 --> 08:52.436
can locate Niles Caulder and
bring him in for questioning.

08:52.469 --> 08:55.903
Do you think
you can handle that?

08:57.307 --> 09:00.210
Prepare yourself,
Beard Hunter.

09:00.243 --> 09:03.543
You've been activated.

09:21.298 --> 09:23.000
Mom?

09:23.032 --> 09:24.533
Where are my shuriken?

09:24.567 --> 09:26.570
Check the dishwasher.

09:26.601 --> 09:31.601
I told you, they're
hand-wash only!

09:34.576 --> 09:37.413
Mom!
I need your help, please!

09:37.447 --> 09:38.947
What happened?

09:38.981 --> 09:41.283
You stuck in your
costume again?

09:41.317 --> 09:44.168
It's not a costume!

09:46.389 --> 09:48.625
Fuck!

09:48.658 --> 09:53.658
Niles Caulder,
I'm coming for you.

10:46.182 --> 10:47.582
Who's there?

11:04.267 --> 11:06.100
I am an Agent of the Oddities.

11:06.134 --> 11:07.671
I am not afraid of death.

11:07.702 --> 11:09.605
I am not afraid of death.

11:36.932 --> 11:38.902
Yes.

11:38.936 --> 11:41.205
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with her.

11:41.238 --> 11:45.173
Her brain activity's
off the charts, and yet, nothing.

11:45.206 --> 11:46.408
Jane's in there somewhere.

11:46.442 --> 11:47.909
So how do we pull her out?

11:47.945 --> 11:50.211
I don't know. Part of me
wishes that we could just...

11:50.214 --> 11:53.216
shrink ourselves
<i>Magic School Bus</i> style,

11:53.250 --> 11:56.519
and get inside her head.

11:56.552 --> 11:57.822
What?

11:57.855 --> 12:00.423
I'm just marveling
at your embrace of the weird

12:00.456 --> 12:03.907
and utterly impossible.

12:10.734 --> 12:15.639
What?

12:15.673 --> 12:18.173
Cliff?

12:18.475 --> 12:21.576
Cliff?

12:21.610 --> 12:23.647
- Cliff!
- We get it, Rita.

12:23.678 --> 12:24.716
Do you?

12:24.748 --> 12:26.514
Three people
are unconscious now,

12:26.548 --> 12:28.451
and you're just, what,
all good?

12:28.485 --> 12:31.187
What exactly
is the plan here?

12:31.221 --> 12:32.788
I have no idea.

12:32.822 --> 12:35.725
But whatever it is,
looks like it's working.

12:35.726 --> 12:36.758
Oh, really?

12:36.759 --> 12:38.760
Forgive me for having doubts,

12:38.793 --> 12:43.793
but what do we really know
about this... thing?

12:46.469 --> 12:49.620
What exactly are you?

12:52.743 --> 12:57.081
Well, I can see why Larry
is so fond of you.

12:57.115 --> 12:59.258
This never would've happened
if the Chief were still here.

12:59.282 --> 13:01.283
You're right.
He's gone.

13:01.317 --> 13:04.620
But us standing around waiting for
these three is not gonna change that.

13:04.653 --> 13:08.104
Let's get back to work.

13:32.413 --> 13:35.519
Hello.

13:35.552 --> 13:40.255
I'm Dr. Niles Evelyn Caulder.
I'm...

13:40.291 --> 13:45.291
I'm a research explorer
from the Bureau of Oddities.

13:45.363 --> 13:49.932
Please, I'm separated
from my partner. I...

13:49.966 --> 13:54.966
You know I'm wounded.
I'm not a threat to you.

13:58.442 --> 14:01.812
Please, those men up there,

14:01.846 --> 14:03.812
I'm not like them.

14:03.846 --> 14:06.447
Those men are hunters.

14:06.481 --> 14:09.033
I'm not a hunter.

14:12.855 --> 14:16.259
I'm a friend.

14:19.897 --> 14:21.995
I'm very cold.

14:25.433 --> 14:28.272
Please, could I...

14:28.303 --> 14:32.841
Could I move a bit closer
to the fire?

14:32.875 --> 14:36.413
I'm not gonna survive this,
whatever your plans are.

14:39.149 --> 14:42.719
I just wanna get...

14:42.753 --> 14:44.452
a little bit warm.

14:49.692 --> 14:51.628
Please, stop.

14:51.659 --> 14:54.464
I'm sorry.

15:13.115 --> 15:15.418
So Danny
is a talking street?

15:15.451 --> 15:18.187
- Yeah.
- Where everyone is gay?

15:18.221 --> 15:22.658
No. I don't know. It's a place
for all kinds of people.

15:22.692 --> 15:24.692
And it travels?

15:24.726 --> 15:26.427
Not "it," "they."

15:26.461 --> 15:28.365
Danny's gender queer.

15:28.399 --> 15:30.000
And they jump, yeah.

15:30.033 --> 15:31.971
And "they" gave you
a comic book?

15:32.003 --> 15:35.339
Look, when you get a comic book
from a talking street named Danny,

15:35.370 --> 15:38.740
it isn't just a comic book.
It has to have some kind of clue.

15:38.774 --> 15:41.210
Well, give it here.

15:41.211 --> 15:43.446
Look, anything that gets us
closer to finding the Chief,

15:43.447 --> 15:46.182
no matter how absurd
or obtuse or dangerous,

15:46.216 --> 15:47.816
we have to use it
to our advantage.

15:47.817 --> 15:50.187
Talking streets,
comic books.

15:50.221 --> 15:52.923
I always thought the weirdest
thing in Chief's life was us.

15:52.956 --> 15:55.926
That's odd.
The hunk is missing.

15:55.957 --> 15:57.394
What?

15:57.427 --> 16:01.565
Cartoon hunk. The hunky muscle
man in this advertisement.

16:01.599 --> 16:05.336
Mmm. I must've seen this add
100 times as a girl.

16:05.370 --> 16:08.205
There's supposed to be
a man there,

16:08.238 --> 16:13.238
but it's empty. It's like he just
walked out of the comic book.

16:36.899 --> 16:40.269
Oh, yeah.

16:40.302 --> 16:41.738
Okay, easy.

16:41.772 --> 16:45.875
Here we go. Easy.

16:45.908 --> 16:46.908
Okay.

16:51.815 --> 16:52.815
Oh!

16:58.956 --> 17:00.690
Be smart now, Ernest.

17:00.724 --> 17:05.075
A little bit goes a long way.

17:08.230 --> 17:09.230
Mmm.

17:25.615 --> 17:27.519
<i>From the Journal
of Niles Caulder.</i>

17:27.549 --> 17:32.423
<i>I've spent weeks at the mercy
of this primitive creature.</i>

17:32.454 --> 17:35.057
<i>Finally, my strength
has started to return.</i>

17:35.092 --> 17:37.192
<i>This specimen
seemingly exists</i>

17:37.228 --> 17:40.096
<i>in complete opposition
to the modern world,</i>

17:40.130 --> 17:42.432
<i>entirely removed
from mankind.</i>

17:42.464 --> 17:45.934
<i>She would be the crown jewel
of the Bureau's collection.</i>

17:45.970 --> 17:47.769
Oh, don't be alarmed.

17:47.805 --> 17:52.040
My... My leg
is feeling better.

17:52.076 --> 17:53.978
It's feeling good,
thank you.

17:54.009 --> 17:56.077
I'll be able
to leave soon.

17:56.114 --> 17:59.817
I'll have to go home.

17:59.848 --> 18:02.086
Home...

18:02.117 --> 18:05.653
I'll have to go.

18:05.690 --> 18:07.758
Home!

18:07.789 --> 18:11.240
You could come with me.

18:19.836 --> 18:23.605
Mmm.

18:27.108 --> 18:30.048
My people would love
to see you.

18:30.078 --> 18:34.578
They'd take great care of you.

18:37.989 --> 18:41.223
I'm never gonna
leave here, am I?

18:41.259 --> 18:44.192
You didn't save me.
You kidnapped me.

18:44.229 --> 18:47.730
I'm just your pet.

18:47.762 --> 18:50.335
I'm a play thing to you.

18:50.365 --> 18:53.671
That's what you think of me,
isn't it?

18:53.701 --> 18:56.605
How dare you!

18:56.637 --> 18:59.143
I'm not a pet monkey!

18:59.174 --> 19:01.111
I'm not an animal!

19:01.144 --> 19:03.011
You're the animal!

19:03.047 --> 19:06.084
We are not animals!

19:06.115 --> 19:08.817
I'm not an animal.

19:14.457 --> 19:15.990
Stay back.

19:16.027 --> 19:19.864
Don't you come near me.

19:19.894 --> 19:22.200
You've kept me here
against my will.

19:22.230 --> 19:24.902
You've bound my hands.

19:24.933 --> 19:28.306
I can't! I will not...

19:28.336 --> 19:32.540
These are not animals
left to rot.

19:32.576 --> 19:35.913
They are men.

19:35.944 --> 19:38.249
They deserve a proper burial.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.219
It's the right...

19:41.250 --> 19:45.902
It's the Christian
thing to do.

20:29.030 --> 20:31.067
My God.

20:31.101 --> 20:33.951
What is this place?

20:39.210 --> 20:43.259
Oh God,
this is remarkable.

20:46.518 --> 20:49.354
<i>There appears to be even
more to this strange creature</i>

20:49.384 --> 20:51.653
<i>than I'd originally assumed.</i>

20:51.690 --> 20:54.356
<i>I'd always suspected
that my captor was primitive,</i>

20:54.392 --> 20:57.259
<i>but I never considered
what that truly meant.</i>

20:57.294 --> 20:58.827
<i>This ancient culture,</i>

20:58.864 --> 21:01.963
tens of thousands of years old
<i>by my estimation,</i>

21:01.999 --> 21:05.000
<i>was once a proud tribe.</i>

21:05.036 --> 21:09.740
<i>But one by one,
they faded away.</i>

21:09.771 --> 21:12.323
<i>Except...</i>

21:15.444 --> 21:17.182
<i>Unless my eyes
deceived me,</i>

21:17.213 --> 21:21.585
<i>my captor had existed
within this tribe for generations.</i>

21:21.616 --> 21:23.988
<i>Every era.</i>

21:24.019 --> 21:26.823
<i>The question was, how?</i>

21:26.855 --> 21:28.526
<i>Eternal life.</i>

21:28.557 --> 21:31.126
<i>Something I never before
considered possible.</i>

21:31.162 --> 21:33.431
<i>Something I struggled
to comprehend.</i>

21:33.462 --> 21:36.164
<i>My mind raced with questions,</i>

21:36.200 --> 21:40.201
<i>but I could not
find my voice.</i>

21:40.238 --> 21:42.873
<i>I could only bear witness,</i>

21:42.904 --> 21:46.355
<i>and behold her.</i>

22:33.191 --> 22:35.441
<i>Oyewah.</i>

22:43.901 --> 22:48.438
<i>Oyewah.</i>

22:48.471 --> 22:50.441
<i>Finally,
I began to understand</i>

22:50.472 --> 22:55.472
<i>the nature of the creature
I had found.</i>

23:06.855 --> 23:09.991
Mmm.

23:41.659 --> 23:46.659
<i>And then,
in a single moment...</i>

23:46.761 --> 23:48.865
<i>Oyewah.</i>

23:52.303 --> 23:57.303
<i>I realized that I understood
absolutely nothing at all.</i>

24:11.886 --> 24:14.725
It's really you!

24:14.726 --> 24:15.726
Cyborg!

24:15.727 --> 24:18.692
Yes, yes, the famous Cyborg.
Incredible.

24:18.693 --> 24:19.461
And you are?

24:19.462 --> 24:22.364
Looking for one Niles Caulder.

24:22.365 --> 24:23.334
Missing.

24:23.335 --> 24:24.566
How do you know Niles Caulder?

24:24.567 --> 24:26.903
Oh, I know all about
Niles Caulder.

24:26.935 --> 24:29.307
I know how the Bureau of
Normalcy is looking for him.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.142
I know about his
band of freaks,

24:31.173 --> 24:33.375
the race car driver,
the basket case,

24:33.411 --> 24:37.445
the test pilot,
the Hollywood actress...

24:37.480 --> 24:38.714
And so much more.

24:38.750 --> 24:41.182
I'm sorry. Who are you, again?

24:41.219 --> 24:43.721
Well, I'm known by many names.

24:43.752 --> 24:47.625
In Spain, they call me
<i>El Cazador de Barba.</i>

24:47.656 --> 24:50.993
My psyche profile,
they call me a pogonophile.

24:51.028 --> 24:56.028
But most commonly,
those who dare speak my name

24:56.133 --> 24:59.883
call me the Beard Hunter.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.742
Okay.
The Beard Hunter.

25:06.778 --> 25:09.310
So the Bureau
of Normalcy hired...

25:09.346 --> 25:11.582
the Beard Hunter.

25:11.615 --> 25:13.017
Okay, what else
do we need to know?

25:13.018 --> 25:15.519
If you're the Beard Hunter,
why don't you have a beard?

25:15.550 --> 25:16.618
Hormone disorder.

25:16.653 --> 25:18.086
Man, how do you
know Niles Caulder?

25:18.121 --> 25:21.222
I consumed Niles' essence.

25:21.259 --> 25:24.492
Fragments of his facial hair.

25:24.528 --> 25:25.528
Still fresh.

25:25.529 --> 25:27.962
- Ugh.
- Wait. Hold up.

25:27.998 --> 25:31.134
"Consumed his essence"?

25:31.165 --> 25:32.367
You didn't...

25:32.403 --> 25:34.636
In the bathroom,

25:34.672 --> 25:37.140
did you eat Niles' drain scum?

25:37.173 --> 25:39.509
- Ugh.
- Why?

25:39.541 --> 25:41.089
What's a soggy piece of hair
got to do with the Chief?

25:41.113 --> 25:45.950
What's hair
got to do with the Chief?

25:51.121 --> 25:52.520
You better back your ass up.

25:52.557 --> 25:55.490
I'm sure you care very much
about finding the Chief.

25:55.526 --> 25:56.526
We all do.

25:56.527 --> 26:02.126
But I'm not sure he can help you
with whatever is wrong with you.

26:02.265 --> 26:05.634
Help me?

26:05.669 --> 26:08.038
You really don't know
him at all, do you?

26:08.070 --> 26:12.144
You think finding Niles will rescue
you from your pathetic lives,

26:12.174 --> 26:16.815
but Niles Caulder is not the
man he's led you to believe.

26:16.846 --> 26:20.048
Niles Caulder is not
your savior.

26:20.084 --> 26:21.919
He's a false god.

26:21.951 --> 26:25.990
Finding him will
change nothing.

26:26.021 --> 26:31.021
You'll still be nothing more
than a broken football star

26:31.058 --> 26:32.827
and a washed-up actress.

26:32.828 --> 26:34.462
Then just tell me why
we should be listening

26:34.463 --> 26:37.903
to this crazy-ass lunatic we just
found passed out in the bathroom?

26:37.933 --> 26:39.768
'Cause I know the truth
about Niles Caulder,

26:39.769 --> 26:42.007
and I know how to find him.

26:42.038 --> 26:46.375
His beard calls out to me
from across time and space.

26:46.411 --> 26:48.711
I can hear its siren song.

26:48.746 --> 26:50.512
That's my superpower.

26:50.548 --> 26:53.481
My <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

26:53.518 --> 26:56.586
I can trace a man's beard
anywhere it is,

26:56.618 --> 26:58.221
anywhere it has been.

26:58.255 --> 26:59.255
Okay.

27:17.709 --> 27:19.959
Okay, I'm done.

27:22.746 --> 27:27.746
Never underestimate
the power of the beard.

27:29.184 --> 27:32.691
<i>From the journal
of Niles Caulder, date unknown.</i>

27:32.722 --> 27:37.722
After the funeral, I choose to <i>remain and
study the creature in her natural habitat.</i>

27:38.230 --> 27:41.865
<i>She wields a psychic power
with incredible potential.</i>

27:41.897 --> 27:45.403
<i>What other wonders could
she possible unlock?</i>

27:45.433 --> 27:47.368
<i>Immortality.</i>

27:47.403 --> 27:49.538
<i>A bridge to the unknown.</i>

27:49.573 --> 27:51.909
She is the ultimate discovery.

27:51.942 --> 27:56.077
<i>She represents all the
Bureau of Oddities stands for.</i>

27:59.517 --> 28:00.817
<i>- Horkon.
- Horkon?</i>

28:00.851 --> 28:03.251
- That's a new one.
<i>- Horkon laka.</i>

28:03.287 --> 28:04.519
<i>- Horkon?
- Horkon.</i>

28:12.394 --> 28:14.298
<i>After that day,</i>

28:14.329 --> 28:16.531
<i>I fell deathly ill.</i>

28:45.663 --> 28:47.529
Stay back.

28:47.565 --> 28:49.567
I'm not well.

29:36.681 --> 29:38.780
<i>Were if not for each other,</i>

29:38.816 --> 29:43.463
<i>we would have perished.</i>

29:54.096 --> 29:56.346
<i>Oyewah.</i>

29:59.300 --> 30:01.550
<i>Oyewah.</i>

30:31.299 --> 30:34.152
You are remarkable.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.663
All right, that gentleman
is clearly a nut muffin,

30:58.693 --> 31:01.265
but I think we should
try to use him.

31:01.298 --> 31:04.567
If he knows where the Chief is,
that can help us.

31:04.601 --> 31:07.769
Maybe we can co-star with him.

31:07.805 --> 31:09.507
You mean "team-up"?

31:09.538 --> 31:11.472
Yes, that.

31:12.644 --> 31:15.278
If it helps us find the Chief,
we have to follow it.

31:15.310 --> 31:19.682
That's what you said, right?
No matter what.

31:34.298 --> 31:35.097
Ah!

31:35.098 --> 31:38.166
All right, you're right, um...

31:38.201 --> 31:41.636
- Okay, here's the plan.
- Mmm.

31:41.672 --> 31:43.539
- We just let him go.
- What?

31:43.575 --> 31:46.344
Something tells me this Beard Hunter
guy isn't much of a team player.

31:46.375 --> 31:51.326
But we can track him,
using this.

31:53.750 --> 31:55.787
Impressive doohickey, Victor.

31:55.817 --> 31:57.788
But how are we supposed
to track him?

32:01.990 --> 32:04.595
Hey! He hasn't told
you yet, has he?

32:04.626 --> 32:05.894
What's wrong with him?

32:05.930 --> 32:08.464
He's been lying to all of you!
Haven't you, Victor?

32:08.500 --> 32:10.299
Okay, Beard Hunter,
you're, like, a nine.

32:10.335 --> 32:12.245
I'm gonna need you to
take it down to, like, a four.

32:12.269 --> 32:15.069
It's too late, Cyborg. I consumed
a sample of your essence.

32:15.070 --> 32:16.441
I'm inside your head now.

32:16.472 --> 32:18.709
Facial hair connects me
to the secrets of the universe.

32:18.740 --> 32:20.175
It's the ultimate flavor savor.

32:20.211 --> 32:22.313
All the memories,
secrets, sandwiches...

32:22.346 --> 32:24.749
A man's beard
witnesses all things.

32:24.779 --> 32:26.548
And only I can
decode the language.

32:26.585 --> 32:28.384
You wet the bed until
you were six years old.

32:28.419 --> 32:30.586
You killed your mother
when you were 18.

32:30.621 --> 32:33.423
When you were little,
you called her "Cotton Candy,"

32:33.454 --> 32:35.259
and she called you...

32:38.827 --> 32:40.162
I know it all!

32:40.163 --> 32:42.229
Your facial hair connects
me directly to the brain stem.

32:42.230 --> 32:45.934
Sure.

32:50.508 --> 32:52.142
Ha!

32:52.173 --> 32:53.173
Whoo!

32:59.981 --> 33:01.353
Just hit him already!

33:01.384 --> 33:03.488
Tell me, Cyborg. Why would
a man like Niles Caulder

33:03.519 --> 33:06.056
choose to live with a gallery
of rejects like her?

33:06.057 --> 33:07.587
And why would he want
you to join them?

33:09.826 --> 33:11.625
Grid, diagnostic check.

33:11.626 --> 33:12.662
What's up with my arm cannon?

33:12.663 --> 33:14.132
Unknown threat detected.

33:14.163 --> 33:16.164
Host has been compromised.

33:16.201 --> 33:17.933
- What?
- Well, well, well...

33:17.969 --> 33:20.269
Looks like I'm not the only one
inside your head.

33:20.305 --> 33:22.505
Initiating
total system control.

33:22.538 --> 33:23.605
What is he talking about?

33:23.606 --> 33:25.142
That's what
you were told, right, Cyborg?

33:25.143 --> 33:27.376
The search for Niles Caulder
would destroy you all.

33:27.412 --> 33:29.746
- Shut up!
- Victor, what are you doing?

33:29.778 --> 33:30.913
Grid.

33:30.948 --> 33:32.158
Weapons systems
have been activated.

33:32.182 --> 33:33.548
Grid, deactivate cannon.

33:33.584 --> 33:35.250
- Here we go.
- I repeat...

33:45.028 --> 33:46.962
What on Earth
is wrong with you?

33:46.998 --> 33:51.998
There's nothing
wrong with me.

33:53.434 --> 33:55.438
Beard Hunter!

33:55.471 --> 33:56.838
Just admit it.

33:56.874 --> 33:58.942
You'll never find the Chief.

33:58.976 --> 34:00.278
You don't want to.

34:00.309 --> 34:03.180
You're afraid of what you'll
find if you keep looking.

34:03.181 --> 34:04.646
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

34:04.647 --> 34:07.884
Actually, I've seen who you
and Niles Caulder really are.

34:07.919 --> 34:09.885
And the truth is...

34:11.922 --> 34:13.489
You're not gonna
like the truth.

34:15.760 --> 34:16.760
Oh.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.893
Here he comes.

34:23.266 --> 34:24.601
Grid.

34:24.635 --> 34:25.802
Stand down.

34:25.835 --> 34:26.969
I got this.

34:27.003 --> 34:28.338
Host has
been compromised.

34:28.371 --> 34:30.675
System control has
been deemed necessary.

34:30.708 --> 34:33.610
Listen to the little voice
in your head, Cyborg.

34:33.643 --> 34:34.911
You're not in control.

34:34.945 --> 34:36.289
Target acquired.

34:36.313 --> 34:38.090
- Lethal force activated.
- Grid, stop!

34:38.114 --> 34:39.849
- T-minus five...
- Stop now!

34:39.882 --> 34:42.119
- Careful!
- ...four, three, two...

34:42.152 --> 34:44.789
Stop!

34:47.958 --> 34:49.592
You could
have killed them!

34:49.626 --> 34:51.391
Victor, shut it down!

34:51.393 --> 34:52.128
I can't.

34:52.129 --> 34:53.463
"I can't."

34:53.496 --> 34:54.565
- Victor?
- Victor?

34:54.597 --> 34:57.202
Voice Command.
Activate emergency shutdown.

34:57.233 --> 34:58.969
Code word, "Elinore."

35:00.905 --> 35:01.905
Get out of here.

35:01.938 --> 35:04.242
- I'm sorry?
- Go!

35:04.273 --> 35:06.342
Look at me. Look at my face.

35:06.376 --> 35:08.545
I want you to always
remember this.

35:08.577 --> 35:09.945
Ernest Franklin,

35:09.981 --> 35:14.150
the man who defeated Cyborg.

35:14.184 --> 35:17.654
I wonder, who will
play me in the movie?

35:18.390 --> 35:22.438
It's okay. Just let him go.

35:44.947 --> 35:46.684
<i>Spring has sprung,</i>

35:46.715 --> 35:48.518
<i>and life is returning.</i>

35:48.552 --> 35:53.552
<i>I have chosen to remain
here in the north.</i>

36:03.434 --> 36:06.135
<i>This is no longer a journey
of scientific discovery</i>

36:06.168 --> 36:09.039
<i>but an exploration
of something deeper.</i>

36:09.072 --> 36:12.141
<i>Something within myself.</i>

36:12.175 --> 36:14.010
There is nothing but the hunt,

36:14.043 --> 36:16.612
<i>nothing but the thrill</i>

36:16.646 --> 36:19.449
<i>and peril</i>

36:19.481 --> 36:23.552
<i>of survival.</i>

36:23.585 --> 36:27.186
<i>It's liberating.</i>

36:49.847 --> 36:51.215
<i>Days pass into months.</i>

36:51.248 --> 36:53.117
<i>Months pass into years.</i>

36:53.150 --> 36:55.918
<i>My old life fades.</i>

36:55.952 --> 36:59.588

37:49.172 --> 37:53.309
Hello, old friend.

37:53.342 --> 37:56.746
I can't believe you're alive
after all this time.

37:58.248 --> 38:01.818
Did you know that
I went to your funeral?

38:01.851 --> 38:04.987
Hmm.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.123
Niles, I'm sorry.

38:07.157 --> 38:08.659
I shouldn't have
left you up here.

38:08.693 --> 38:12.862
If anyone should be asking
forgiveness, Alistair, it's me.

38:12.896 --> 38:15.965
Those scars.

38:15.998 --> 38:18.568
In fact, I should
be thanking you.

38:18.601 --> 38:23.251
I finally found where I belong.

38:23.974 --> 38:26.610
You can't possibly
plan on staying out here.

38:26.643 --> 38:29.579
Ah, the Bureau will
manage fine without me.

38:29.612 --> 38:32.315
You've been gone
a long time, Niles.

38:32.349 --> 38:34.083
The world's changed.

38:34.117 --> 38:35.117
We're at war.

38:35.118 --> 38:37.353
A Great War.

38:37.387 --> 38:39.322
Worst anyone's ever seen.

38:39.356 --> 38:41.123
I didn't know.

38:41.157 --> 38:42.425
We had no choice.

38:42.458 --> 38:44.793
Organization had to change.

38:44.827 --> 38:46.496
Mission had to evolve.

38:46.530 --> 38:49.300
Odd is out. Normal is in.

38:49.333 --> 38:51.635
What does that mean?

38:51.668 --> 38:53.570
The mission.

38:53.603 --> 38:56.739
We still seek out that
which is abnormal,

38:56.773 --> 39:00.373
only now we exterminate.

39:03.213 --> 39:05.215
You've been gone, Niles.

39:05.248 --> 39:07.318
The world no longer
needs explorers.

39:07.351 --> 39:12.300
The world always
needs explorers.

39:16.893 --> 39:20.929
Tell me, how did
you do it, survive out here?

39:20.963 --> 39:24.300
I was fortunate.

39:24.333 --> 39:26.871
I found the bodies
of those two missing hunters.

39:26.905 --> 39:30.639
They had equipment, gear,
enough for me to survive.

39:30.672 --> 39:31.840
I foraged.

39:31.876 --> 39:35.844
And I learned to hunt.

39:35.878 --> 39:37.880
Winters were difficult.

39:37.914 --> 39:39.483
I managed to find shelter.

39:39.516 --> 39:44.516
Well, I sure had the wrong
impression of you, Niles Caulder.

39:46.690 --> 39:51.161
Your hairy little girlfriend.

39:51.195 --> 39:56.166
She didn't have anything to do with
your miraculous survival, did she?

39:56.199 --> 39:58.101
Don't deny it.

39:58.135 --> 39:59.969
I've seen her.

40:00.003 --> 40:02.139
I've been tracking her.

40:02.172 --> 40:04.474
She's good.

40:04.507 --> 40:07.244
Haven't found her nest.

40:09.914 --> 40:13.213
Why don't you show me?

40:17.219 --> 40:19.822
What the hell
happened back there?

40:19.856 --> 40:21.023
Just a glitch.

40:21.056 --> 40:23.293
Victor.

40:23.327 --> 40:27.864
Something's wrong.

40:27.896 --> 40:30.333
With me.

40:30.367 --> 40:32.702
Ever since my reset
button got pushed,

40:32.735 --> 40:35.271
something's been
wrong in my system.

40:35.304 --> 40:36.675
And it's getting worse.

40:36.706 --> 40:38.943
Did you ask
your father for help?

40:38.974 --> 40:40.210
I can't trust my dad.

40:40.242 --> 40:41.576
If I ask him for help,
he would just

40:41.577 --> 40:43.880
take control of my whole system
and never let go.

40:43.914 --> 40:45.414
He's not like Niles.

40:45.449 --> 40:48.418
He's, um...

40:48.452 --> 40:51.688
I gotta handle this
whole thing on my own.

40:51.722 --> 40:54.525
What are you going
to do about it, then?

40:54.559 --> 40:57.027
We can't keep blowing up
the mansion every other day.

40:57.059 --> 40:59.161
I can fix it.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.697
I promise.

41:00.731 --> 41:02.330
But don't tell anyone yet.

41:02.331 --> 41:03.500
They rest of the team
can't know.

41:03.501 --> 41:05.335
They'll worry I'm
turning into that...

41:05.369 --> 41:09.539
psychopath
in Jane's painting.

41:09.572 --> 41:14.009
What are the rest of us
supposed to do in the meantime?

41:14.010 --> 41:14.943
We need you.

41:14.944 --> 41:17.213
We need the Chief.

41:17.246 --> 41:19.515
As ridiculous as it sounds,

41:19.516 --> 41:20.951
our best chance
of finding him just

41:20.952 --> 41:25.454
kicked my ass
with some beard magic.

41:25.489 --> 41:27.190
Thank goodness I was able
to stick him

41:27.224 --> 41:31.927
with that tracking doohickey thing
of yours before he got away.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.128
You're kidding.

41:33.164 --> 41:34.431
Mmm.

41:34.463 --> 41:37.233
Rita Farr, you're amazing!

41:37.266 --> 41:38.434
Fix yourself up quick.

41:38.467 --> 41:39.838
Once you're back online,

41:39.869 --> 41:42.905
we'll track down
the Beard Hunter together.

41:42.938 --> 41:44.373
Thank you.

41:52.014 --> 41:55.485
Welcome back, Jane.

41:55.518 --> 41:59.590
Give her some room.

41:59.623 --> 42:03.126
What the hell
happened here?

42:03.159 --> 42:05.858
Long story.

42:12.135 --> 42:15.905
What happened in there?

42:15.940 --> 42:19.943
It's not my story to tell.

42:19.976 --> 42:21.327
I get it.

42:30.186 --> 42:31.255
Fortunate.

42:31.289 --> 42:34.023
That monster you and I were
after all these years

42:34.059 --> 42:39.059
turned out to be nothing more
than a hairy little troll.

42:40.164 --> 42:41.697
After last time,

42:41.731 --> 42:46.402
I traveled north with half a
dozen men for protection.

42:49.539 --> 42:52.608
Seems silly now.

42:52.643 --> 42:55.077
How did you find her?

42:55.110 --> 42:57.815
She found me.

42:57.847 --> 43:00.848
Bureau will give me
an award for this one.

43:01.586 --> 43:03.118
Both of us.

43:04.053 --> 43:06.155
Did you hear that?

43:06.188 --> 43:07.425
Hear what?

43:07.456 --> 43:10.025
I believe
the word is...

43:10.059 --> 43:11.893
<i>"Horkon."</i>

43:19.469 --> 43:21.472
I'm not the man you remember.

43:21.505 --> 43:22.739
Help me!

43:22.773 --> 43:24.741
No one can know about her.

43:24.742 --> 43:25.742
Ah!

43:25.743 --> 43:28.445
She's my secret to protect
from the world.

43:28.478 --> 43:29.478
Help!

43:38.521 --> 43:40.771
<i>Oyewah.</i>

44:39.083 --> 44:42.385
<i>My journey to the north
was fraught with peril.</i>

44:42.418 --> 44:45.255
<i>It came at a great cost.</i>

44:45.289 --> 44:49.559
But I'm pleased to report to the
gentlemen of the Bureau that,

44:49.592 --> 44:53.630
whilst my experience
was unique,

44:53.664 --> 44:56.666
there is nothing odd to report.

44:56.699 --> 45:01.672
There is no monster
to speak of.

45:01.704 --> 45:05.474
I was alone for many years.

45:05.510 --> 45:09.079
But, in that time,
I did make a discovery.

45:09.112 --> 45:14.112
I discovered the strength
inside myself to survive

45:14.452 --> 45:17.152
and to outwit

45:17.186 --> 45:19.322
and outlast

45:19.356 --> 45:24.356
whatever true monsters
this world has to offer.

45:27.097 --> 45:29.032
Thank you.

45:50.222 --> 45:52.922
Well, what do you know? Even
I discovered something today.

45:52.956 --> 45:55.524
Didn't know you've been
eavesdropping on my memories.

45:55.525 --> 45:56.625
Haven't
you noticed?

45:56.626 --> 45:59.731
I'm crafting a story
piece by piece.

45:59.762 --> 46:02.599
"The Search for the Chief."
This...

46:02.632 --> 46:06.603
unexpected wet dream of yours,

46:06.635 --> 46:08.838
this is a very
important chapter.

46:08.871 --> 46:12.876
The day Niles Caulder
changed forever.

46:12.909 --> 46:14.411
Don't know
what you're talking about.

46:14.443 --> 46:16.478
Oh, don't you?

46:16.512 --> 46:18.213
Well, what did we learn?

46:18.248 --> 46:19.849
You murdered your friend

46:19.882 --> 46:24.487
and left your dream girl behind,
all for what?

46:24.521 --> 46:26.021
True love?

46:29.592 --> 46:32.262
More secrets.

46:32.295 --> 46:33.797
Hmm.

46:33.829 --> 46:36.565
More layers to the banana,
unappealing.

46:39.003 --> 46:43.306
Secrets have a cost.
Look at what they've cost you.

46:43.340 --> 46:47.744
Look at what the search for you
has cost them,

46:47.777 --> 46:50.914
your band of bargain-bin
action figures.

46:50.947 --> 46:52.899
They're stronger
than you think.

46:52.900 --> 46:57.188
I'm counting on it.
But you and I both know,

46:57.222 --> 47:02.222
there's no way they all make it
to the finish line.

47:04.128 --> 47:07.231
You've always been a man comfortable
with compromise, Niles.

47:07.264 --> 47:10.501
I mean, after all, you fell
in love with a Canadian.

47:10.534 --> 47:13.536
Let's play a game.

47:13.570 --> 47:15.039
Answer one question,

47:15.072 --> 47:18.407
and all this goes away.

47:18.440 --> 47:19.710
You go home.

47:19.742 --> 47:23.547
Yes, your precious family
will survive.

47:23.579 --> 47:26.416
There'll be chocolate cake,
balloons.

47:26.449 --> 47:30.619
Just answer one question.

47:30.655 --> 47:34.425
Where is the girl?

47:34.456 --> 47:36.360
I don't know what you mean.

47:36.393 --> 47:40.295
That's what all this
has been about, hasn't it?

47:40.329 --> 47:41.532
All this time.

47:41.565 --> 47:46.565
Your foolish quest to live forever.
All to keep her safe.

47:46.838 --> 47:50.039
You're wrong.

47:50.074 --> 47:53.210
You and I have been doing this
dance for a long time, Niles.

47:53.244 --> 47:55.579
I don't know how,
and I don't know why,

47:55.612 --> 47:57.447
but, somehow,

47:57.481 --> 48:00.952
you've managed to keep a hairy
little secret away from me,

48:00.983 --> 48:03.353
and I want the truth.

48:03.385 --> 48:06.655
Where is she?

48:06.690 --> 48:08.260
Tell me!

48:08.291 --> 48:13.130
- Think about what will happen to them if you don't...
- No.

48:13.164 --> 48:18.164
No. I don't care
what you do to them.

48:18.436 --> 48:23.436
I will never give you the
satisfaction of breaking me.

48:24.041 --> 48:29.041
Now, that's the Niles Caulder
that I know.

48:48.164 --> 48:50.733
<i>Hey, Mama, it's Ernest.</i>

48:50.766 --> 48:52.235
My mission was a huge success,

48:52.268 --> 48:54.304
<i>I guess I'm a legit
supervillain now.</i>

48:54.338 --> 48:57.007
<i>Anyway, been tracking Niles
Caulder's beard here for days,</i>

48:57.039 --> 48:59.842
<i>but I'm getting closer.
I can smell it.</i>

48:59.876 --> 49:01.421
<i>All right, be home soon.</i>

49:01.445 --> 49:04.414
<i>Hi, Ernie.
Sorry I missed your call.</i>

49:04.447 --> 49:08.184
<i>So exciting
about the beard-hair thing.</i>

49:08.217 --> 49:10.219
<i>Hope you're making
lots of friends.</i>

49:10.253 --> 49:12.922
<i>Anyway, I love you.
Come home soon.</i>

49:12.956 --> 49:17.956
<i>Also, I need the car back.</i>

49:19.429 --> 49:20.628
Finally.

49:25.869 --> 49:28.871
Oh, hello, there.

49:28.905 --> 49:30.675
Who are you?

49:30.706 --> 49:33.376
Have you come to play with me?

49:33.409 --> 49:36.409
I like your costume.
