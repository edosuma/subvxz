00:10.800 --> 00:12.300
                then drop him   
                in a vat of acid

00:12.300 --> 00:14.100

Oh, boy, Norm.                  
When we were kids,

Mr. Sheridan is having

            possibly break them.

     I, on the other hand,      
      am a nervous wreck.       

06:22.600 --> 06:23.800
    What's the matter,          
            Rebecca?            

06:23.800 --> 06:25.400
Well, I knew                    
I was going to have             

06:25.400 --> 06:26.600
to take care                    
of the dog,                     

06:26.600 --> 06:27.800
 but I didn't know it was going 

06:27.800 --> 06:29.100
 to be in a place that was huge 

06:29.100 --> 06:30.200
  and kind of like a mausoleum  

06:30.300 --> 06:32.300
      and is stuck way out      
  in the middle of the moors.   

06:32.400 --> 06:34.300
    There are no moors          
    in Massachusetts.           

06:34.300 --> 06:37.500
     I think they had them      
     flown in or something.     

06:37.500 --> 06:39.500
The point is,                   

06:39.500 --> 06:42.100
  this place is big and scary   
     and I really hate it.      

06:42.100 --> 06:44.600
    Oh, and to make matters     
    even worse, last night,     

06:44.600 --> 06:47.500
the only thing I could get      
  on television was this movie  

06:47.500 --> 06:50.000
  about this young, beautiful,  
    dark-haired woman,          

06:50.100 --> 06:51.500
    that was all alone          

06:51.500 --> 06:53.300
in this                         
deserted house.                 

06:53.300 --> 06:56.000
Hey, what about that scene      
where the guy cuts her head off?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.500
         Woody, please.         

06:58.500 --> 07:00.300
         There's no way         
her head's gonna come off       

07:00.400 --> 07:01.800
  in one clean cut like that.   

07:03.600 --> 07:06.000
     Believe me, I've seen      
     my uncle butcher hogs,     

07:06.000 --> 07:08.300
      and you have to hack      
    and hack and hack.          

07:11.300 --> 07:12.600
 And when the gardener got it?  

07:12.700 --> 07:14.500
     Woody, that's enough!      

07:14.600 --> 07:17.700
     All right. Don't spoil     
 the ending for everybody else. 

07:17.700 --> 07:20.100
Yeah, but when you see it,      
         take my advice         

07:20.200 --> 07:23.000
  and turn away when you hear,  
        vrooom-mm-mm-mm!        

07:23.000 --> 07:24.400
Vrooom-mm-mm-mm!                

07:24.400 --> 07:25.900
         Woody! Woody.          

07:25.900 --> 07:28.800
 I am just a tiny bit on edge.  

07:28.800 --> 07:30.500
     Oh. Sorry, Miss Howe.

        Stop it, Woody!         

07:41.300 --> 07:44.300
    Some bar manager,           
      afraid of a blender.      

07:46.000 --> 07:48.100
                Let me see here.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.300
         Rebecca Howe,          
      all alone and scared      

07:51.300 --> 07:53.400
      in a big old house.       

07:53.500 --> 07:55.600
Sounds to me                    
like a job                      

07:55.700 --> 07:58.400
for Sammy's                     
Security Company.               

07:58.500 --> 08:02.500
        We get in               
    before the burglars do.     

08:02.600 --> 08:04.900
    That's what I like          
        about you, Sam.         

08:04.900 --> 08:07.300
Your pants are always thinking. 

08:09.700 --> 08:11.200
    Frasier, darling.           

08:11.200 --> 08:13.400
Hello, there, Peanut Butter Cup.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.500
You know, you're late for lunch.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
    Yes, I know. I'm sorry.     

08:15.700 --> 08:17.200
    Well, I'm sure you          
    have a very good excuse.    

08:17.200 --> 08:18.200
     Well, actually, I do.      

08:18.200 --> 08:20.200
     I started having lunch     
     at another restaurant,     

08:20.200 --> 08:21.500
 then remembered we had a date. 

08:21.600 --> 08:24.500
    Oh. Well, would you like    
        to watch me eat?        

08:24.500 --> 08:25.800
      I wouldn't miss it.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.600
Oh, it's nothing, really.       

08:34.600 --> 08:36.400
            It's just this      
            relaxation exercise 
            I've been doing.    

08:36.400 --> 08:37.799
            I've been imagining 

08:37.900 --> 08:39.400
            people naked and    
            wearing black socks,

08:39.400 --> 08:41.400
        you see, to relieve my  
        anxiety over my speech. 

08:41.400 --> 08:42.700
                Frankly, it's   
                worked miracles.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.900
                I've been doing 
                it all week.    

08:43.900 --> 08:45.500
        I haven't even          
        thought about it once.  

08:45.500 --> 08:47.100
When <i>do</i> you                     
present that?

        Calm down.              

09:17.100 --> 09:18.700
Probably wasn't anything.

        It was probably         
    just a tree branch

      against the window.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.400
Well, you left                  
the back door open.             

10:07.500 --> 10:09.600
I just followed some guy        
carrying a meat hook.           

10:11.500 --> 10:12.700
                    That is real
                    funny, Sam.

Right. I have to admit,         
I'm glad you are here.

and the storm came,

I started getting               
scared to death.                

10:26.700 --> 10:30.600
 What happened to that $10,000  
    champion watchdog?

in the kitchen.                 

10:32.200 --> 10:34.700
            Oh, God! I can't    
            seem to calm down.  

10:34.700 --> 10:37.100

                beating so fast.

till the lights went out.

because you were concerned

     to get me in the sack?

            Hey, I came out here

        without ending up       
        rolling on the floor.

this or not--

     a lot of people think,     

11:57.300 --> 11:59.100
    I'm not that dumb.          

11:59.200 --> 12:00.400
     Here, come on. Try me.     

12:00.500 --> 12:02.000
  Sit down. Let's conversate.   

12:07.300 --> 12:08.900
Okay, so what do you            
want to talk about?             

12:08.900 --> 12:10.300
                        Sex.    

12:11.800 --> 12:13.200
You know,                       
sex is obviously                

12:13.300 --> 12:15.200
the only thing                  
on your mind, so forget it.

I'm going to bed.               

12:16.600 --> 12:18.500
                Oh, that's      
                good with me.

to bed alone.

to stay here,

on the couch.

          at my place.

This man?

He's Woody.

I was his teacher.              

18:11.400 --> 18:12.500
I got real lonely,              

18:12.600 --> 18:14.400
a-and I thought I'd call        
him over here for company.

Well, don't worry, Miss Howe.
