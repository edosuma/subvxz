03:46.601 --> 03:48.481
J remember...

03:50.561 --> 03:52.321
my stepfather

03:52.481 --> 03:56.201
wouJd beat me with extension cords

03:56.881 --> 03:58.481
and hangers,

03:58.641 --> 04:01.201
pieces of wood
and aJJ kinds of stuff.

04:02.161 --> 04:05.481
He wouJd teJJ me:
"Jt hurt me more than you.

04:06.801 --> 04:09.281
"J onJy did it, because J Jove you."

04:10.561 --> 04:14.001
Jt communicated the wrong message

04:14.161 --> 04:16.440
to me about what Jove was.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.440
So, for many years,

04:20.601 --> 04:23.401
J thought
that Jove was supposed to hurt.

04:25.281 --> 04:27.761
J hurt everyone that J Joved.

04:28.641 --> 04:31.841
And J measured Jove

04:32.001 --> 04:35.601
by how much pain
someone wouJd take from me.

04:39.281 --> 04:41.841
And it wasn t untiJ J came to ison,
[ pr

04:42.001 --> 04:44.841
an environment
that is devoid of Jove,

04:46.001 --> 04:48.481
that J began to have
some understanding

04:48.641 --> 04:51.641
about what it actuaJJy
was and was not.

04:58.081 --> 04:59.721
J met someone.

05:05.201 --> 05:09.241
She gave me my first reaJ insight
into what Jove was.

05:09.401 --> 05:12.921
She saw past my condition

05:13.481 --> 05:17.041
and the fact that J was in prison
with a Jife sentence

05:17.201 --> 05:20.921
for doing the worst kind of murder
that a man can do:

05:21.081 --> 05:23.401
murdering a woman and a chiJd.

05:24.321 --> 05:26.161
Jt was Agnes,

05:27.281 --> 05:29.521
the mother and grandmother of...

05:30.801 --> 05:33.841
Patricia and Chris, that J murdered,

05:34.401 --> 05:37.521
who gave me
my best Jesson about Jove.

05:39.001 --> 05:41.721
By aJJ rights, she shouJd hate me.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.721
[
But she didn t.

05:53.121 --> 05:55.161
Over the course of time,

05:57.561 --> 05:59.881
through the journey that we took,

06:02.601 --> 06:04.561
it has been pretty amazing,

06:07.481 --> 06:09.441
she gave me Jove.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.201
She taught me what it was.

08:23.801 --> 08:26.241
J m ve happ when it ains,
[ ry y r

08:26.401 --> 08:27.641
when J drink miJk

08:27.801 --> 08:29.161
and J have a good Jife.

08:29.321 --> 08:30.481
When J put on weight.

08:30.641 --> 08:32.601
[
J m thin now.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.121
When it rains,

08:34.280 --> 08:35.961
J am very happy.

08:36.121 --> 08:37.321
When J drink miJk

08:37.481 --> 08:39.681
and J eat everything J Jike.

08:39.841 --> 08:42.841
And when J sJeep with the man J Jove

08:43.001 --> 08:44.561
who says sweet things to me.

08:44.721 --> 08:47.361
And when J am in a nice hut

08:47.521 --> 08:49.961
that protects me
from the coJd and rain.

08:50.121 --> 08:51.321
Those are the things

08:51.481 --> 08:53.681
that make me happy.

09:00.441 --> 09:02.041
Happiness, for us,

09:02.961 --> 09:04.441
wouJd be...

09:05.361 --> 09:07.001
having food,

09:07.481 --> 09:09.201
a smaJJ piece of Jand

09:10.681 --> 09:13.041
and a reaJ pJace to Jive,

09:13.201 --> 09:15.601
with eJectricity day and night.

09:16.641 --> 09:19.161
We wouJdn t have to sJee
[ p
in the dark.

09:20.921 --> 09:23.081
That wouJd be happiness.

09:23.241 --> 09:24.801
But we sJeep on the fJoor,

09:24.961 --> 09:28.321
without even a mat, on straw.

09:28.481 --> 09:29.561
With eJectricity,

09:29.721 --> 09:33.041
there wouJd be Jight
in m chiJd en s Jives.
y r [

09:35.681 --> 09:37.081
So,

09:37.641 --> 09:39.521
as J had

09:39.681 --> 09:42.721
a difficuJt chiJdhood
without any money,

09:43.681 --> 09:46.281
when J went to university,

09:46.881 --> 09:49.801
J got a grant

09:49.961 --> 09:52.961
and J bought myseJf a motorbike.

09:53.521 --> 09:54.681
Brand-new!

09:54.841 --> 09:58.201
J was the first person
to start it up.

09:58.361 --> 10:00.441
J was the first person to get on it

10:00.601 --> 10:02.481
to go home.

10:02.641 --> 10:04.201
When J feeJ the wind

10:04.361 --> 10:06.281
whipping me as J ride aJong,

10:06.441 --> 10:08.081
[
knowing that J m not

10:08.241 --> 10:10.001

on someone eJses moto bike.

10:10.161 --> 10:12.201
Jts m ve own moto bike.
[ y ry r

10:14.201 --> 10:16.161
J arrived home,

10:16.321 --> 10:17.441
and to get to sJeep,

10:17.601 --> 10:19.361
J put the bike in my bedroom

10:19.521 --> 10:21.161
and J Jocked myseJf in with it.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.721
That way, J couJd smeJJ

10:22.881 --> 10:24.761
the hot engine.

10:24.921 --> 10:27.401
The smeJJ of the engine,

10:28.001 --> 10:29.361
the new bike smeJJ.

10:29.521 --> 10:31.321
And when J turned the Jight on,

10:31.481 --> 10:33.721
J couJd see it was my very own bike.

10:33.881 --> 10:35.761
J couJdn t ut the bike
[ p

10:35.921 --> 10:37.921
on the bed, under the covers,

10:38.081 --> 10:40.041
[
but its what J wanted to do.

10:40.201 --> 10:41.201
Yes...

10:41.961 --> 10:44.401
J feJt it. Yes.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.681
That was a moment
of great happiness for me.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.601
Happiness

10:51.961 --> 10:55.041
is the chiJdren coming home.

10:55.241 --> 10:58.201
Thats a mothe s ha iness.
[ r[ pp

10:58.361 --> 11:00.241
Jts when m husband

comes home, smiJes,

11:00.481 --> 11:03.561
and kisses me,
after 33 years of married Jife.

11:03.721 --> 11:06.561
Thats a woman s ha iness.
[ [ pp

11:08.761 --> 11:10.281
Happiness is hearing

11:10.441 --> 11:13.521
my grandchiJdren saying: "Grandma!"

11:14.081 --> 11:17.481
When they say that, you feeJ oJder,

11:17.641 --> 11:19.881
but thats ha iness, too.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.921

Jts aJso meeting coJJeagues

11:23.081 --> 11:25.761

11:25.921 --> 11:28.001
They think:

" [ r [ "
Shes he e, Jets taJk.

11:31.961 --> 11:33.881
Thats ha iness, too.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.801

Jts getting up in the mo ning

11:37.561 --> 11:39.401
and not hurting anywhere.

11:39.561 --> 11:41.401
Thats ha iness, too.
[ pp

11:41.881 --> 11:45.201
Jts the ain which is the omise
[ r pr
of a good harvest.

11:45.361 --> 11:46.601
There are many kinds of happiness,

11:46.761 --> 11:49.441
but at the same time,
the es onJ one:

11:50.201 --> 11:52.881
ou e aJive, so ou e happ.
y [r y [r y

11:56.041 --> 11:58.361
Just my experiences
from being in a wheeJchair

11:58.521 --> 12:00.361
and traveJing the worJd
in a wheeJchair

12:00.521 --> 12:02.201
[ r r
Jve seen Jife f om a diffe ent angJe

12:02.361 --> 12:05.001
[
and thats taught me
on a spirituaJ JeveJ

12:05.601 --> 12:07.201
to just accept and to be happy,

12:07.361 --> 12:09.601

whateve s coming next.

12:10.761 --> 12:12.841
J m so mentaJJ st ong.
[ y r

12:13.001 --> 12:16.481
The onJy reason is because
of Josing my Jegs physicaJJy.

12:16.641 --> 12:19.081
M e esights sha pe, m ea s a e...
y y [ r r y r r

12:19.241 --> 12:20.921
J can hear much better.

12:22.721 --> 12:24.961
So, thats on a h sicaJ sense, but
[ p y

12:25.121 --> 12:26.961
J feeJ Jm Juck, as in
[ y

12:27.121 --> 12:31.841
J don t anaJ e
[ yz
or question Jife too much.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.001
J can cruise through Jife

12:34.161 --> 12:37.121
and aJways be
in the right pJace at the right time.

12:37.281 --> 12:39.161
J aJways have amazing things
happen to me.

12:39.321 --> 12:41.361
J m eaJJ Juck in that situation.
[ r y y

12:45.161 --> 12:47.321
But that comes from beJieving in Juck

12:47.481 --> 12:49.681
or beJieving
in the power of attraction

12:49.841 --> 12:51.521
or beJieving in

12:51.681 --> 12:54.281
attracting the goodness
[
into ones Jife.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.961
And J think

12:56.121 --> 12:58.721
that can be seen as Juck.

12:59.441 --> 13:01.241
So, if God HimseJf

13:01.401 --> 13:03.681
jumped down in front of me right now
and said to me:

13:03.841 --> 13:05.761
B uno, J JJ give ou back ou Jegs,

13:05.921 --> 13:08.561

J JJ teJJ God: Kee ou Jegs.
[ " p y r "

17:55.121 --> 17:59.121
We didn t use to die Jike toda.
[ y

17:59.281 --> 18:01.561
We Jived in peace.

18:02.561 --> 18:04.761
r [
Ou fighting didn t kiJJ us.

18:04.921 --> 18:07.561
There was onJy one gun per viJJage.

18:07.721 --> 18:11.001
What decimates us is the KaJashnikov.

18:11.161 --> 18:14.401
Before, we onJy died
from sickness and disease.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.641
A few peopJe died:

18:16.801 --> 18:18.721
a sick person, an oJd man, a baby.

18:18.881 --> 18:20.241
OnJy the weak.

18:20.401 --> 18:22.801
The victims of the KaJashnikov

18:22.961 --> 18:24.641
are countJess.

18:24.801 --> 18:26.281
Our fighting is degenerating.

18:26.441 --> 18:28.201
3 men die from one shot.

18:28.361 --> 18:30.921
Yesterday, peopJe died.

18:31.081 --> 18:33.681
We didn t bu them.
[ ry

18:35.041 --> 18:38.441
Maybe animaJs ate them.

18:38.601 --> 18:40.121
That weapon is bad.

18:40.281 --> 18:43.081
Jt deprives the young generation
and the country

18:43.241 --> 18:45.321
of peace.

18:47.601 --> 18:49.881
As soon as J took up arms,

18:50.041 --> 18:51.841
J feJt fear.

18:52.001 --> 18:54.201
Fear is a human feeJing.

18:54.361 --> 18:56.641
J was afraid of bJood.

18:56.801 --> 18:58.561
When J took up arms,

18:58.721 --> 19:02.761
J went from being a teacher
to a man of arms.

19:02.921 --> 19:04.361
J had no choice.

19:04.521 --> 19:08.241
J saw and experienced things
which forced me to do it.

19:09.921 --> 19:13.961
Sometimes my son asks me,
because it worries him:

19:14.721 --> 19:18.041
"Dad, why this war?
Js there no end to it?

19:19.121 --> 19:21.761
"Why do you kiJJ the soJdier?

19:21.921 --> 19:24.441
Doesn t the soJdie have a famiJ
" [ r y

19:24.921 --> 19:28.121
"waiting for him, just Jike us?"

19:28.281 --> 19:31.481
J say to him:
"H [ r [r r "
es w ong and we e ight.

19:31.641 --> 19:33.161
"Why, Dad?"

19:33.321 --> 19:36.321
J say:
"He kiJJs famiJies and chiJdren.

19:36.481 --> 19:38.601
"He destroys mosques.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.121
"We defend aJJ that."

19:41.281 --> 19:44.881
We aJways try to be cJear
to the chiJdren.

19:45.041 --> 19:47.881
We teJJ them that we took up arms,

19:48.041 --> 19:51.241
because we had to,
not because we wanted to.

19:51.401 --> 19:54.961
[
J don t Jike having bJood
on my hands...

19:56.601 --> 20:00.281
or the idea that J kiJJed someone.

20:00.441 --> 20:02.761
Nobody Jikes that.

20:04.561 --> 20:06.561
J m not af aid of death.

But J m no Jonge af aid.

20:18.361 --> 20:21.361
Even if my throat is cut
or J get bJown up.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.721
What matters is joining my father

20:24.881 --> 20:26.561
or going back to Syria.

20:39.561 --> 20:42.081
During the genocide...

20:44.681 --> 20:46.801
J was separated from my parents

20:47.641 --> 20:49.361
and J Jived aJone

20:50.001 --> 20:51.921
in the sorghum fieJds.

20:52.081 --> 20:54.681
J spent at Jeast two weeks there.

20:55.281 --> 20:57.321
Then,

20:58.081 --> 21:00.001
someone took me.

21:00.161 --> 21:04.321
She asked me who J was.

21:04.881 --> 21:07.361
But as J was very JittJe,

21:07.521 --> 21:10.641
[
J couJdn t distinguish
between Hutus and Tutsis.

21:10.801 --> 21:12.481
J didn t eaJJ know.
[ r y

21:12.761 --> 21:15.321
She Jooked at me and started touching

21:15.481 --> 21:18.921
my fingers, my skin.

21:19.081 --> 21:21.001
She toJd me J was a Tutsi

21:21.161 --> 21:22.921
or mixed race.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.881
She toJd peopJe to shoot me,

21:27.041 --> 21:28.401
to eJiminate me.

21:28.561 --> 21:32.121
J asked why,

21:32.641 --> 21:34.961
[ r
what Jd done w ong.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.201
After that,

21:39.401 --> 21:42.681
there was a Jot of shooting.

21:42.841 --> 21:45.761
J ran away.

21:46.041 --> 21:48.481
AJJ aJong the way,

21:48.641 --> 21:52.241
there were corpses and bJood.

21:52.401 --> 21:55.961
Then J sat down and asked God

21:56.361 --> 21:58.641
that His wiJJ be done.

22:00.841 --> 22:03.321
J was Jucky to survive.

22:15.121 --> 22:16.961
J went home.

22:17.841 --> 22:20.281
The door was smashed in.

22:20.441 --> 22:22.241
Jn front, there was a hoJe

22:22.401 --> 22:24.201
where a sheJJ had faJJen.

22:24.361 --> 22:27.681
J went in
and found my father Jying there.

22:28.361 --> 22:31.041
J saw my brothers too, behind him.

22:31.201 --> 22:34.121
My father
had opened the door to them.

22:34.281 --> 22:36.561
He toJd them

22:36.961 --> 22:39.441
there were no combatants.

22:39.601 --> 22:41.041
They toJd him to step forward.

22:41.201 --> 22:43.641
My mother and brothers were Jined up.

22:43.801 --> 22:44.921
"Join them."

22:45.081 --> 22:48.761
As soon as he moved,
they started shooting.

22:49.761 --> 22:51.761
He got a buJJet in the back.

22:52.161 --> 22:53.841
He feJJ.

22:54.001 --> 22:56.961
They started shooting at my brothers.

22:58.001 --> 23:00.281
At the time of the massacre,

23:00.441 --> 23:03.841
in 1982, J was a young student.

23:04.001 --> 23:07.961
J didn t hate an one,
[ y
J feJt no hatred.

23:08.121 --> 23:11.921
But that massacre
made me question many things.

23:12.081 --> 23:13.321
J asked myseJf:

23:13.481 --> 23:16.521
"Who Joves me? Who hates me?

23:16.681 --> 23:18.641
"Why did this happen?"

23:18.801 --> 23:20.361
J thought more about it

23:20.521 --> 23:22.881
and aJJ that brought about in me

23:23.041 --> 23:24.921
a Jove of hatred,

23:25.081 --> 23:26.761
a Jove of vengeance.

23:26.921 --> 23:30.441
[ r
Man isn t bo n with those feeJings.

23:30.601 --> 23:33.841
They grow
over the course of your experiences.

23:34.001 --> 23:35.801
Both Jove and hatred.

23:37.081 --> 23:40.001
WouJd you forgive me
if J kiJJ your father or brother?

23:41.401 --> 23:43.761
Jf no Jaw stands in my way?

23:44.481 --> 23:46.441
Jf your rights are scorned?

23:46.601 --> 23:48.121
WouJd you forgive me

23:48.281 --> 23:51.801
if Jd kiJJed ou b othe,
[ y r r r
father or mother?

23:51.961 --> 23:53.721
No, certainJy not.

23:54.401 --> 23:55.561
No way.

23:56.841 --> 23:58.081
J wiJJ never forgive.

23:58.241 --> 24:00.481
Even if my head is cut off.

24:04.121 --> 24:06.241
One evening, whiJe in the reserves,

24:06.401 --> 24:09.521
my unit had to stop a suicide attack

24:09.681 --> 24:12.441
by capturing a terrorist

24:12.601 --> 24:15.281
in a viJJage near NabJus.

24:15.761 --> 24:17.641
J depJoyed our forces.

24:17.801 --> 24:20.521
To fJush him out,
we shot at the waJJs

24:20.681 --> 24:23.321
as a demonstration of strength.

24:24.401 --> 24:26.201
A woman came out of the house,

24:26.361 --> 24:27.921
carrying a girJ

24:28.081 --> 24:30.441
and hoJding another by the hand.

24:30.601 --> 24:32.121
Jt was 3 AM.

24:32.281 --> 24:35.921
The girJ panicked and ran toward us.

24:36.081 --> 24:38.601
J was af aid she d bJow he seJf u.
r [ r p

24:38.761 --> 24:41.641
J yeJJed at her in Arabic to stop.
She kept coming.

24:41.801 --> 24:44.321
J fired above her head.

24:44.481 --> 24:45.961
She stopped.

24:46.361 --> 24:49.041
At that moment, time stood stiJJ.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.801
Jt was the shortest
and the Jongest moment

24:52.961 --> 24:53.881
of my Jife.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.401
The girJ remained aJive.

24:59.441 --> 25:01.681
And so did J.

25:01.841 --> 25:03.801
But at the same time,

25:03.961 --> 25:05.921
something died

25:06.081 --> 25:07.481
in us both.

25:08.081 --> 25:09.881
When a chiJd is shot at,

25:10.041 --> 25:11.681
it kiJJs something inside.

25:11.841 --> 25:13.601
[
J don t know what.

25:13.761 --> 25:16.041
When an aduJt shoots at a chiJd,

25:16.761 --> 25:18.761
it kiJJs something inside.

25:18.921 --> 25:20.561
Something dies

25:20.721 --> 25:24.561
and something eJse
has to come to Jife.

25:24.721 --> 25:27.081
J was ashamed of shooting at her.

25:27.241 --> 25:28.841
A painfuJ shame.

25:29.001 --> 25:30.841
And above aJJ, this sensation

25:31.001 --> 25:33.001
of my finger

25:33.161 --> 25:35.241
pressing the trigger

25:35.401 --> 25:37.441
and shooting at the girJ.

25:38.601 --> 25:43.161
From this finger pressing the trigger

25:43.321 --> 25:45.601
something had to come to Jife.

25:48.361 --> 25:51.961
One of the most impactfuJ things
that wiJJ occur,

25:52.121 --> 25:54.881
after being in combat,

25:55.041 --> 25:57.081
is the feeJing

25:57.241 --> 25:59.521
of kiJJing another human being.

25:59.681 --> 26:02.601
Once ou ve ex e ienced it,

26:09.161 --> 26:11.041
And unfortunateJy,

26:11.561 --> 26:13.201
that feeJing,

26:14.201 --> 26:17.161
your body wiJJ want
to experience again.

26:17.321 --> 26:19.481
Jts eaJJ difficuJt
[ r y

26:19.641 --> 26:23.081
to try to expJain to somebody

26:24.081 --> 26:26.601

what that feeJing s Jike.

26:26.761 --> 26:30.641
Right now,
J stiJJ feeJ Jike experiencing

26:30.801 --> 26:32.361
that again,

26:32.521 --> 26:34.441
and its obabJ wh J kee
[ pr y y p

26:34.601 --> 26:37.521
a Joaded weapon in my house.

26:38.921 --> 26:41.321
J yearn or desire for someone

26:41.481 --> 26:43.761
to try to hurt me

26:43.921 --> 26:45.041
or to break in

26:45.201 --> 26:47.121
or to give me an excuse

26:47.281 --> 26:50.561
to use that vioJence
against somebody eJse again.

28:40.561 --> 28:43.481
On the 16th of January 2007,

28:44.241 --> 28:46.761
an JsraeJi border poJiceman
shot and kiJJed

28:46.921 --> 28:49.201
my 10-year-oJd daughter, Abir,

28:49.361 --> 28:52.841
in front of her schooJ
in Anath where J Jive.

28:53.001 --> 28:55.561
She was with her sister
and two friends.

28:55.721 --> 28:57.801
9.30 in the morning.

28:57.961 --> 29:00.161
Jn her head in the back

29:00.321 --> 29:03.081
from a distance of 15 to 20 meters

29:03.241 --> 29:05.201
by a rubber buJJet.

29:07.641 --> 29:09.921
r [ r
Abi wasn t a fighte.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.641
She was just

29:12.321 --> 29:13.681
a chiJd.

29:13.841 --> 29:16.161
She didn t know an thing
[ y
about the confJict

29:16.321 --> 29:18.881
and she was not part
of this confJict.

29:19.161 --> 29:21.081
UnfortunateJy, she Jost her Jife

29:21.241 --> 29:23.241
because she was a PaJestinian.

29:24.281 --> 29:26.521
[ r r
J m an Js aeJi who Jost his daughte

29:26.681 --> 29:28.081
to a suicide bombing

29:28.241 --> 29:31.441
on the 4th of September 1997.

29:32.601 --> 29:35.201
And J am a product of...

29:37.281 --> 29:38.801
of an education system.

29:38.961 --> 29:42.961
These are two societies at war.

29:45.041 --> 29:48.881
They sociaJize the young generation

29:49.041 --> 29:53.761
to make them abJe to sacrifice
themseJves when the time comes.

29:53.921 --> 29:56.881
This is true to PaJestinian society

29:57.041 --> 30:00.241
and this is aJso true
to JsraeJi society.

30:01.761 --> 30:03.601
Because we are human beings.

30:03.761 --> 30:05.681
Sometimes you think:

30:05.841 --> 30:08.001
"Jf J kiJJ the kiJJer

30:08.161 --> 30:11.481
"or anyone from the other side,
from the JsraeJis,

30:11.641 --> 30:13.401
"or maybe ten,

30:13.561 --> 30:17.001
"this wiJJ give me back my daughter."

30:17.801 --> 30:19.161
No.

30:19.681 --> 30:21.281
J JJ cause anothe ain
[ r p

30:21.441 --> 30:24.281
and another victim to the others.

30:25.041 --> 30:27.201
J decided
to break this circJe of vioJence

30:27.361 --> 30:29.681
and bJood and revenge

30:29.841 --> 30:33.041
by stopping kiJJing
and supporting revenge,

30:33.201 --> 30:34.841
by myseJf.

30:36.281 --> 30:38.241
My definition of "sides"

30:38.401 --> 30:41.041
has changed dramaticaJJy.

30:41.201 --> 30:43.881
Today, on my side are

30:44.041 --> 30:47.561
aJJ those who want peace and are
wiJJing to pay the price of peace.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.161
On the other side

30:49.321 --> 30:51.121
are those who do not want peace

30:51.281 --> 30:54.201
and are not wiJJing
to pay the price of peace.

30:55.641 --> 30:57.161
Many peopJe toJd me:

30:57.321 --> 31:00.321
Jts not ou ight
" [ y r r
to forgive in her name."

31:01.761 --> 31:04.201
And the answer:
its aJso not m ight
[ y r

31:04.361 --> 31:06.921
to seek revenge in her name.

31:10.881 --> 31:14.201
J ho e shes satisfied.

31:15.121 --> 31:17.521
J hope she rests in peace.

31:20.881 --> 31:22.281
e es what ha ened:
H r [ pp

31:22.441 --> 31:23.841
a German officer

31:24.001 --> 31:25.161
in an SS uniform

31:25.321 --> 31:27.201
entered the ghetto

31:27.361 --> 31:29.401
one rainy night.

31:29.561 --> 31:32.321
My mother toJd him:
"Take my daughter."

31:32.481 --> 31:35.921
She Jifted the wire fence

31:36.081 --> 31:38.721
and handed him her baby, me,

31:38.881 --> 31:41.801
a Jewish girJ
2 and a haJf years oJd.

31:41.961 --> 31:44.081
And with a heavy heart,

31:44.241 --> 31:46.401
she put me in the hands

31:46.561 --> 31:48.161
of a wonderfuJ man

31:48.321 --> 31:50.601
in an SS uniform.

31:50.761 --> 31:53.321
J now know that this man,

31:53.481 --> 31:54.601
AJoïs PJeva,

31:54.761 --> 31:56.401
served in the German army

31:56.561 --> 31:59.601
and Jived near the German border.

31:59.761 --> 32:03.281
This man put me in his coat.

32:03.441 --> 32:06.201
He hid me inside his coat

32:06.361 --> 32:08.041
and took me

32:08.201 --> 32:11.841
to the border
between Germany and PoJand

32:12.001 --> 32:13.561
to his parents.

32:13.721 --> 32:17.241
They passed me off as his daughter.

32:17.401 --> 32:20.721
They raised me
in the purest CathoJic tradition

32:20.881 --> 32:23.121
untiJ the end of the war.

32:23.281 --> 32:25.761
What a gesture!

32:25.921 --> 32:28.001
What magic,

32:28.161 --> 32:29.721
this outstretched hand!

32:29.881 --> 32:33.201
Like sparks of Jight

32:33.361 --> 32:36.361
in what we caJJ human foJJy.

32:37.881 --> 32:41.241
Sometimes a question comes to mind.

32:41.401 --> 32:43.601
Jf J had been

32:43.761 --> 32:46.161
in a situation Jike that,

32:46.801 --> 32:49.721
wouJd J have acted in the same way

32:49.881 --> 32:52.801
as that German officer?

32:53.601 --> 32:55.241
How can J answer

32:55.401 --> 32:56.801
such a question?

32:56.961 --> 32:59.321
[
J don t think J wouJd have had

32:59.481 --> 33:01.761
the moraJ strength to do it,

33:01.921 --> 33:03.361
in aJJ honesty.

33:03.521 --> 33:04.681
Maybe.

33:04.841 --> 33:06.561
Did he know he had the strength?

33:06.721 --> 33:08.441
How can you know?

33:08.601 --> 33:09.921
How can you recognize

33:10.081 --> 33:11.721
the moment of truth

33:11.881 --> 33:13.721
when you can sacrifice yourseJf,

33:13.881 --> 33:16.681
sacrifice the onJy Jife you have

33:16.841 --> 33:18.561
for someone eJse?

33:19.001 --> 33:20.841
r [ r
The es no answe to that question.

33:21.001 --> 33:22.161
Or a question

33:22.321 --> 33:24.241
others can answer.

33:24.401 --> 33:26.441
But this question must be asked.

35:48.241 --> 35:51.601
Love is the beginning and the end.

35:53.361 --> 35:56.321
Love is where we come from,
r [r
whe e we e going

35:56.481 --> 35:59.241
and what we Jive between the two.

36:00.481 --> 36:02.201
Love is everything.

36:03.761 --> 36:05.081
Love.

36:05.521 --> 36:09.281
The word Jove
is fuJJ of meaning for me.

36:10.161 --> 36:11.481
When you taJk about Jove,

36:11.641 --> 36:13.281
it encompasses everything.

36:13.801 --> 36:16.121
Love encompasses everything,
[
doesn t it?

36:16.281 --> 36:19.081
Whe e the es no Jove, ou feeJ em t

36:19.961 --> 36:22.161

36:24.841 --> 36:26.201
Love...

36:27.281 --> 36:29.521
Love is what fiJJs the souJ.

36:30.161 --> 36:32.641
You have to take Jove
one day at a time.

36:32.801 --> 36:34.841
You Jive it every day.

36:36.201 --> 36:39.521
Love is this feeJing that you can

36:40.361 --> 36:42.161
give

36:42.321 --> 36:44.361
and that the other person gives you.

36:44.521 --> 36:47.481
My wife has a strong character.

36:47.841 --> 36:51.841
Shes the one who guides the famiJ.

37:03.761 --> 37:05.561
Do you hear? Why?

37:05.721 --> 37:07.721
Through Jove comes sex.

37:07.881 --> 37:09.921
Without sex, ou JJ go w ong.

37:10.081 --> 37:12.201
Your wife wiJJ ask herseJf:

37:12.361 --> 37:14.921
"He gives me Jove, but not sex.

37:15.081 --> 37:18.081
"Love, food, cJothing, everything,

"but not sex.

"What can J do with this man?"

What wiJJ happen to our home?
The home wiJJ coJJapse,

37:24.921 --> 37:27.401
because after Jove must come sex.

37:27.561 --> 37:30.321

why Jove exists.

Othe wise, the es nothing.

37:44.401 --> 37:47.321
Oh, wow!

37:47.481 --> 37:49.321
Jf Jve had Jove s?

J never Jearned to dance.

J t ied, but it didn t wo k.

38:16.521 --> 38:18.161
So, J gave up.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.161
When you marry someone,

38:25.321 --> 38:27.321
you marry them as they are.

38:27.481 --> 38:30.041
At a given moment,

38:30.201 --> 38:31.801
J had an accident.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.441
J Jost my arms and Jegs.

38:37.761 --> 38:39.681
But she stood it

38:39.841 --> 38:42.281
for a number of years.

38:42.441 --> 38:44.401
We ended up separating,

38:44.561 --> 38:46.161
we got a divorce.

38:46.321 --> 38:48.801
J had to start a new Jife.

38:48.961 --> 38:51.601
Jt took me 3 years
to get over the break-up.

38:51.761 --> 38:53.721
After 3 years, J said to myseJf:

"Y [ y y r "

38:55.841 --> 38:58.481
So, J signed up on the internet

38:58.641 --> 39:00.321
to a dating site.

39:00.481 --> 39:02.881
At first, J just put a head shot.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.841
The rest was a surprise.

J didn t show J had no a ms o Jegs.

J had fun on the net,

but when J toJd peopJe
about my handicap,

39:11.641 --> 39:13.081
nobody answered me.

39:13.241 --> 39:14.601
So, J announced my handicap

39:14.761 --> 39:16.801
and one day, J met Suzanna.

39:16.961 --> 39:19.601

We have a one-eyed dog,

39:46.601 --> 39:49.761
Sometimes,
eyes speak more than mouths.

39:50.201 --> 39:52.121
When J was younger, J wondered

39:52.281 --> 39:54.681
how peopJe couJd Jive together

But its not!

40:05.481 --> 40:07.041
Every day,

40:07.201 --> 40:08.401
J think,

"Yesterday, my Jove was weaker.

40:12.801 --> 40:15.041
And then, a year goes by.

40:15.201 --> 40:18.081
This Jove becomes even stronger.

40:19.201 --> 40:20.681
When J go to bed at night,

40:20.841 --> 40:22.601
J Jook at him and think,

40:23.641 --> 40:25.241
if he died,

40:25.401 --> 40:28.361
J couJd never repJace him.

After being married for...

50 years, 49...

40:39.161 --> 40:40.961
51 years.

40:42.161 --> 40:44.961
My wife took seriousJy iJJ

40:46.441 --> 40:48.441
just before we ceJebrated

40:48.601 --> 40:50.961
our 50th wedding anniversary.

40:51.441 --> 40:54.321
And she suffered terribJy

40:54.481 --> 40:56.281
for about 2 years

40:56.841 --> 40:58.441
as an invaJid.

40:59.201 --> 41:01.601
For the Jast 2 years of her Jife,

41:01.761 --> 41:03.801
J was her nurse,

41:04.241 --> 41:06.441
J was her doctor, J was her friend,

41:06.601 --> 41:08.881
J was her Jover, J was her husband.

41:09.841 --> 41:12.441
Everybody wanted me to get

41:12.601 --> 41:15.081

41:15.881 --> 41:18.401

She onJy wanted me to Jook after her.

41:20.961 --> 41:23.561
And J Joved doing it for her.

41:23.721 --> 41:26.561
And J did it by myseJf.

41:26.721 --> 41:28.201
J carried her to the car,

41:28.361 --> 41:30.521
J carried her oxygen tank,

41:30.681 --> 41:31.801

41:31.961 --> 41:34.441
J packed it in the car,
J pushed her round,

J put it back, J took her home,

41:36.401 --> 41:38.201
J bathed her, J put her to bed.

41:38.361 --> 41:39.601
And J Joved it

41:39.761 --> 41:41.961
that J was abJe to do it for her

41:42.121 --> 41:43.521
without anyone eJse.

The magic moment

was right after my grandmother died.

41:57.561 --> 41:58.801
J went to go see him.

54:04.201 --> 54:06.641
and the meaning of Jove.

54:06.801 --> 54:08.681
Because to Jive together,

54:08.841 --> 54:11.641
you must Jove yourseJf,

54:11.801 --> 54:13.361
Jove your wife,

54:13.561 --> 54:15.441
your chiJdren,

54:19.601 --> 54:22.801
You must Jove your famiJy,
your parents.

54:22.961 --> 54:25.041
My parents are stiJJ aJive.

You must Jove

54:29.041 --> 54:30.841

54:31.001 --> 54:33.001

54:34.281 --> 54:36.161
for onJy the Jove of peopJe

54:38.001 --> 54:41.081

59:13.481 --> 59:15.801
No, J never thought about it.

59:15.961 --> 59:18.721
[
J wouJdn t have Jiked to be a man.

59:18.881 --> 59:21.961
Because men have an easy Jife.

59:22.561 --> 59:23.881
Too easy.

59:25.241 --> 59:29.041
And easy Jives are boring.

59:29.601 --> 59:32.761
Jts eas ofessionaJJ,
[ y pr y

59:32.921 --> 59:34.801
maybe even easier to attain

59:34.961 --> 59:37.601
their sentimentaJ prey.

59:37.761 --> 59:40.201
For women,
everything is more difficuJt.

59:40.361 --> 59:43.441
But there is aJso the appeaJ

59:43.601 --> 59:46.481
of attaining your goaJs
despite the difficuJties.

59:47.801 --> 59:51.201
Without question, J prefer

59:51.361 --> 59:53.001
being a woman.

59:54.481 --> 59:58.081
J feeJ powerJess when, say,

59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.961
a very smaJJ woman enters the store,

01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:04.561
sees something high up
and says to me:

01:00:04.721 --> 01:00:06.641
"Jf onJy a man couJd get that..."

01:00:06.801 --> 01:00:10.001
Y [
ou don t have to be a man.
Jump up and grab it.

01:00:10.161 --> 01:00:12.601
You have two hands. Why a man?

01:00:12.761 --> 01:00:14.001
Whatever next?

01:00:14.161 --> 01:00:16.121
Jt makes me so angry.

01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:19.921
J eaJJ don t Jike it when women...

01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:24.081

when women are discriminated against.

J can do Jots of things

J couJd never stand that.

01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:23.441
So, JuckiJy,

01:02:23.601 --> 01:02:25.361
poJygamy for women

01:02:27.801 --> 01:02:31.441
Because J just couJdn[t imagine it

01:02:32.441 --> 01:02:35.001
When J went and stayed with my...

01:02:35.761 --> 01:02:38.121
wife at her house in San Francisco...

01:02:38.281 --> 01:02:39.801
Shes not m wife,

but the woman Jm with.

01:02:42.561 --> 01:02:44.161
This was about a week

01:02:44.321 --> 01:02:45.721
after we started dating.

01:02:46.281 --> 01:02:48.521
J woke up in the morning and J said:

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:51.481
"J ask this of you
and this of you and this of you

01:02:52.601 --> 01:02:54.401

The woman Jm with

01:03:01.721 --> 01:03:04.161
And it took her about a month

01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:06.161
after J pointed that out to her

01:03:06.641 --> 01:03:09.601
to reaJize
that these nos couJd not exist.

01:03:09.761 --> 01:03:13.681
And so, thats how ve JittJe shitt

my woman is.

01:03:13.841 --> 01:03:17.441
Shes f eakin ve uni ue,

01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:19.281
She gives me...

01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:22.761
Like, she was raised
to adore her man.

01:03:22.921 --> 01:03:25.001
Like oJd-schooJ Mexican.

01:03:25.161 --> 01:03:26.681
Know when to speak up.

01:03:26.841 --> 01:03:29.641
[
That doesn t mean
ou can t teJJ me something,
y [

01:03:29.801 --> 01:03:32.681
[
that doesn t mean
[
J don t want guidance.

01:03:32.841 --> 01:03:34.401
But in my househoJd,

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:36.201
the man is the man of the house.

01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:40.601
At home, on weekends,
J do the cooking.

01:03:40.761 --> 01:03:42.761
One day, a friend came to my house.

01:03:42.921 --> 01:03:44.961
He said: "You do the cooking?"

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.001
J said: "Yes."

01:03:46.161 --> 01:03:47.201
"Js your wife sick?"

01:03:47.361 --> 01:03:50.561
" [ r "
J said: No, shes esting.

01:03:50.721 --> 01:03:52.401
"What? You do the cooking

01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:55.001
"whiJe your wife has a rest?"

01:03:55.161 --> 01:03:58.001
"Yes, she needs rest."

01:03:58.161 --> 01:04:02.001
He said:
"My wife wiJJ never come visit you.

ou d ut ideas in he head.
"Y [ p r

01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:07.681
"When she comes home,

she JJ ask me to cook too.

01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:12.601
J said to him: "You must understand

01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:14.721
"that they need to rest."

01:04:15.321 --> 01:04:16.921
Anyway, J enjoy

01:04:17.081 --> 01:04:19.401
cooking for my famiJy.

01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:25.321
J m in ison,
[ pr

01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:27.601
because J had an abortion.

01:04:27.761 --> 01:04:32.001
J couJdn t have continued m studies
[ y

01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:34.361
because J was in a boarding schooJ

01:04:34.921 --> 01:04:38.721
and J didn t want to sto m studies.
[ p y

01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:42.441
Jd have sto ed fo too Jong,

and J couJdn t conside that.

01:04:50.241 --> 01:04:54.121
So, J decided to have an abortion.

01:04:56.761 --> 01:04:58.801
What pJeases me today

01:05:27.321 --> 01:05:29.601
There is a way out of being abused.

01:05:30.241 --> 01:05:31.921
For me, it was tough because

01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:34.001
J used to have the worst abuse.

01:05:34.161 --> 01:05:36.001
J wouJd have a gun put to my head

01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:39.121
and get toJd to go on my knees
and beg for my Jife.

01:05:39.921 --> 01:05:43.081
And J wouJd do it.
My kids used to be watching.

01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:44.841
Or get put out of the house

01:05:45.001 --> 01:05:47.761
and have to sJeep outside
on the steps.

01:05:47.921 --> 01:05:50.081
Jf J moved from there,
[
Jd get a hiding.

01:05:50.241 --> 01:05:52.601
Jt was tough,
because J thought it was me.

01:05:52.761 --> 01:05:55.161
J was the one
that was doing something wrong

01:05:55.321 --> 01:05:56.681
in our marriage.

01:05:57.441 --> 01:06:00.401
J taJked about my kids,
the most important thing of my Jife.

01:06:00.561 --> 01:06:03.481
J thought,
[ r
if J don t move on out of he e,

01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:05.121
[ r
J m eithe going to be dead

01:06:05.281 --> 01:06:06.761
or my kids are going to be dead.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.201
So, J need to move on.

01:06:08.521 --> 01:06:10.401
J need to do something.

01:06:10.561 --> 01:06:13.881
J went home that day
" [ "
and J said to him: J m Jeaving.

01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:16.161
Mark got a bit of a shock,

01:06:16.321 --> 01:06:19.441

because he didn t eaJi e
that J was Jeaving.

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:23.001
H "Y [ r

Thats what Jove is about. Leaving.

01:06:30.201 --> 01:06:33.641
J gave him two choices.
J said to him:

01:06:33.801 --> 01:06:36.881
"You either go for counseJing,
or J Jeave."

01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:39.761
You know what?
Toda, hes a bette man.

01:06:39.921 --> 01:06:42.881
es neve Jifted a hand u fo me
H [ r p r
since the day.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.801
Thats about 9 ea s ago.
[ y r

01:06:46.641 --> 01:06:49.321
So, 9 years ago,
J was stiJJ an abused woman.

01:09:54.561 --> 01:09:55.961
J am gay.

01:09:56.121 --> 01:10:00.161
[ [ r
Jve known Jve Jiked gi Js
ever since J was a JittJe girJ.

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:03.601
And J kept it a secret
from my famiJy.

01:10:03.761 --> 01:10:06.881
J remember when EJJen DeGeneres,
the TV host, came out,

01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:10.881
it was the first time J ever heard
of the word "gay" before.

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.801
My parents were taJking about it.

01:10:12.961 --> 01:10:15.201
J asked my dad: "Dad, what is gay?"

01:10:15.361 --> 01:10:19.801
" [ r r r
Jts a gi J who Jikes anothe gi J
and the e going to heJJ.
y[r "

01:10:19.961 --> 01:10:22.881
And so, J said: "OK."

01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:25.721
J waJked straight up to my room,
cJosed the door

01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:26.801
very quietJy,

01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:30.281
and then,
J bawJed my eyes out into my piJJow.

01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:32.761
And J prayed to God every day:

01:10:32.921 --> 01:10:35.881
"PJease Jet me Jike boys,
pJease make me straight."

01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:38.561
Because J knew J Jiked girJs.

01:10:38.721 --> 01:10:40.521
And so, J tried

01:10:41.281 --> 01:10:44.081
pretending J Jiked boys,
but J never did.

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:45.841
And then, J met

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:48.841
to me the Jove of my Jife.

01:10:49.801 --> 01:10:51.761
And her name is Jen.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:55.041
Gosh, she was just...
my worJd changed.

01:10:55.201 --> 01:10:58.241
And J didn t eaJJ ca e
[ r y r
about anything eJse.

01:10:58.401 --> 01:11:01.241
J just knew J wanted to be near her.

01:11:01.961 --> 01:11:04.081
And that was Jove to me.

01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:10.841
Being a Jesbian
is not a choice for me.

01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:13.481
Jts something that is inside ou...
[ y

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:19.561

to the ma abouts.

01:11:31.281 --> 01:11:34.241
But it just stays there.

01:11:35.201 --> 01:11:36.961
J even had to

01:11:37.121 --> 01:11:39.561
force myseJf with guys

01:11:56.321 --> 01:11:59.121
J even asked a friend of mine

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:02.201
to etend as if hes m bo f iend.

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:04.401
But that guy, what he did...

01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:07.841
He forced himseJf to me

01:12:08.001 --> 01:12:10.641
and then, he Jeft me with HJV.

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:15.721
And that was in 2003.

01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:20.561
J did aJJ that
just to get my granny[s approvaJ
.

01:12:20.721 --> 01:12:22.161
But now

01:12:22.321 --> 01:12:24.841
J know
that J don t have to do an thing

01:12:25.001 --> 01:12:27.441
to pJease someone eJse.

01:12:28.601 --> 01:12:31.521
My parents were so afraid
[ r
Jd emain a homosexuaJ

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.521
that when J said J was changing,

01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:35.001
they reaJJy beJieved it.

01:12:35.721 --> 01:12:37.841
They asked me every day:

01:12:38.001 --> 01:12:39.481
"OK, have you changed?"

01:12:39.721 --> 01:12:41.521
As its not ossibJe to change,
[ p

01:12:41.681 --> 01:12:44.041
J pretended to ignore the question.

01:12:44.201 --> 01:12:47.081
After a whiJe,

y r [ y r

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.361
He started yeJJing at me,

01:12:49.521 --> 01:12:51.241
hitting me and saying:

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:53.921
J know ou haven t changed!

01:12:54.081 --> 01:12:55.921

So, J Jeft. J didn t hesitate.

01:13:02.601 --> 01:13:04.041
J Jeft.

01:13:04.561 --> 01:13:07.081
J have a son who s now 31 ea s oJd

01:13:10.121 --> 01:13:12.001
H [ y y
es ga, a ga man.

01:13:12.161 --> 01:13:14.761
The day that he came out
was quite significant.

01:13:15.161 --> 01:13:17.961
J knew that he was struggJing
with something.

01:13:18.121 --> 01:13:19.881
H [
e d been suicidaJ

01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:22.401
and he was 18 years oJd.

01:13:23.521 --> 01:13:26.841
He said to me one day:
Dad, Jve got to teJJ ou something.
" [ y "

01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:30.601
And J said:
"OK, son, teJJ me, what is it?"

01:13:32.081 --> 01:13:35.641
He went paJe, he reaJJy went white,

01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:38.241
and he said: "J feeJ sick."

01:13:38.401 --> 01:13:40.361
And my heart reaJJy went out to him.

01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:42.881
At that moment, J kind of knew

01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:45.121
that he was going to teJJ me
he was gay

01:13:45.281 --> 01:13:48.281
[
aJthough J hadn t made
that connection,

01:13:48.441 --> 01:13:51.801
because he s uite mascuJine
[ q
in his traits.

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:55.601
At that moment, J had a sense
[
thats what he was going to teJJ me.

01:13:55.761 --> 01:13:58.761
So, J said to him:
"Son, Jet me guess.

01:13:58.921 --> 01:14:01.041
"Let me make it easier for you."

01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:02.001
He said OK.

01:14:02.161 --> 01:14:05.281
"Y [r
J said: ou e going to teJJ me
ou e ga, a en t ou?
y [r y r [ y "

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:08.001
He went: "Yes, J am."

01:14:09.081 --> 01:14:11.841
J just reaJJy, reaJJy feJt for him.

01:14:12.001 --> 01:14:14.681
Jt was such a struggJe for him
to teJJ me that.

01:14:14.841 --> 01:14:16.721
Everything sort of made sense,

01:14:16.881 --> 01:14:18.481
because he didn t want to be ga.
[ y

01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:21.161
And thats wh he d been suicidaJ.
[ y [

01:14:21.321 --> 01:14:24.561
J just gave him a big hug
and said: "J Jove you anyway, son.

01:14:24.721 --> 01:14:27.721
Jt doesn t make an diffe ence
" [ y r
to how much J Jove you."

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:29.721
And J think that

01:14:29.881 --> 01:14:33.601
our reJationship has reaJJy been
a Jot stronger since then.

01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:36.561
[
So, thats been
a journey in itseJf.

01:14:41.121 --> 01:14:44.081
Jt was in 2009.

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:46.281
A friend, homosexuaJ Jike me.

01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:48.841
When this friend died,

01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:50.561
he was buried

01:14:50.721 --> 01:14:53.921
in his viJJage cemetery.

01:14:55.161 --> 01:14:57.921
But the JocaJ imam

01:14:58.081 --> 01:15:00.761
gathered together the peopJe,

01:15:00.921 --> 01:15:02.281
the young peopJe.

01:15:02.441 --> 01:15:04.281
They went to the cemetery

01:15:04.441 --> 01:15:07.161
to dig up the body.

01:15:07.761 --> 01:15:10.321
They took it, tied it up,

01:15:10.481 --> 01:15:12.601
and dragged it through the streets.

01:15:12.761 --> 01:15:15.121
The media were there.

01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:16.881
They fiJmed it.

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:21.561
The poJice came.

01:15:22.801 --> 01:15:26.081
Afterwards,
the famiJy got the body back

01:15:26.881 --> 01:15:28.361
and buried it again.

01:15:28.521 --> 01:15:31.641
Jt was dug up again. 3 times in aJJ.

01:15:31.801 --> 01:15:34.241
Jn the end, the body was buried

01:15:34.401 --> 01:15:36.561
in his fathe s a d.
r[ y r

01:15:36.721 --> 01:15:40.201
Because the MusJim reJigion says

01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.321
that when ou e homosexuaJ,
y [r

01:15:42.481 --> 01:15:43.761

We have no rights

01:16:02.281 --> 01:16:03.761
J think what J can do more

01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:22.921
Because J have a saJary,

01:16:23.081 --> 01:16:25.721
because my mum

01:16:28.161 --> 01:16:30.641

the othe moms won t know

PeopJe shouJd be Jess shy,

more daring
when you have nothing to Jose.

01:16:46.081 --> 01:16:47.361
Some peopJe have a Jot to Jose.

01:16:47.521 --> 01:16:49.881
Those are not the peopJe
that shouJd do the change,

01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:52.561
but the ones
that have nothing to Jose.

01:20:34.321 --> 01:20:36.161
Jn Jraq, one of my friends

01:20:36.321 --> 01:20:38.281
was hit with a car bomb
in front of me.

01:20:38.441 --> 01:20:42.121
J chased after the triggerman
with my squad,

01:20:42.281 --> 01:20:43.881
with one of my teams.

01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:47.681

37 fJoors each,

The sheer humiJiation of it,

the sheer injustice of it!

01:26:29.761 --> 01:26:31.801
J think
the fastest growing sector in Jndia

01:26:31.961 --> 01:26:33.961

a friend who said:

02:05:50.241 --> 02:05:54.001
"Life is Jike carrying a message

02:06:07.801 --> 02:06:10.001
because when J was JittJe,

02:06:10.161 --> 02:06:12.441
J used to imagine fine things,

02:06:12.601 --> 02:06:15.361
to dream of a worJd without beggars

02:06:15.521 --> 02:06:17.681

SimpJe, subtJe things.

over the course of Jife.

Whe es the message
