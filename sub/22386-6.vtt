JAKE:
Nice!

10:15.716 --> 10:16.881
Can you stand on it?

10:16.883 --> 10:19.217
I don't know. Ow...

10:19.219 --> 10:20.585
Definitely not.

10:20.587 --> 10:21.419
Marshall?

10:21.421 --> 10:23.888
(Barking)
Crutch!

10:25.258 --> 10:26.791
There you go.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.659
Oh!

10:27.661 --> 10:29.394
Thanks, Marshall.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.128
No problem!

10:30.130 --> 10:32.797
Okay, pups, let's help
Jake out of this cave.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.800
Follow me!
(Barking)

10:35.802 --> 10:39.204
(Howling)

10:41.541 --> 10:42.907
We did it!

10:42.909 --> 10:43.908
(All howling)

10:43.910 --> 10:47.779
Thanks, PAW Patrol.
You totally saved the day again.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.949
Glad we could help.
If you need anything

10:50.951 --> 10:53.852
while your ankle heals,
just yelp for help.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.754
(Howling and barking)

10:55.756 --> 10:58.356
Uh, I could use one thing.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.658
What do you need?

10:59.660 --> 11:00.525
A ride home.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.428
No problem. Marshall's
got that covered too.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.329
Ah!

11:04.331 --> 11:06.398
Let's go, go, go!

11:06.400 --> 11:08.633
Awesome!

11:10.103 --> 11:13.304
¶ P-p-p-Paw,
Paw, PAW Patrol ¶

11:13.306 --> 11:15.674
Ah, nice and toasty.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.842
And my foot feels great too.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.611
Rubble was so brave.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.646
I was?

11:21.648 --> 11:23.782
I mean, of course I was!

11:23.784 --> 11:28.553
He sure was.
Nothing could stop Super Rubble!

11:28.555 --> 11:31.389
It was nothing. Huh?

11:31.391 --> 11:34.659
S-s-spider!

11:36.763 --> 11:38.363
Uh, thanks, Ryder.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.764
No problem, Rubble.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.633
You're all
a bunch of super pups.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.536
(Barking and howling)

11:44.538 --> 11:47.439
¶ P-p-p-Paw, Paw,
PAW Patrol ¶

11:49.776 --> 11:52.811
SKYE:
<i> "Pups Save the Parade."</i>

11:56.683 --> 11:58.516
(Barking and chuckling)

11:58.518 --> 11:59.017
Um...

11:59.019 --> 12:03.288
how are the Adventure Bay
Day preparations coming, pups?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.889
Great! Check this out!

12:04.891 --> 12:07.659
Hose!
(Barking)

12:07.661 --> 12:10.995
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't get the floats wet.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.698
(Barking)

12:13.700 --> 12:14.733
(Laughing)

12:14.735 --> 12:17.368
That'll start
the parade with a bang.

12:17.370 --> 12:17.936
(Laughing)

12:17.938 --> 12:20.438
Hey, Zuma,
cool pirate boat float.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.374
(Laughing)
Arr, shiver me timbers, dude.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.777
Check out my float, Chase.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.679
Green means go...

12:27.681 --> 12:29.681
to the parade.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.422
Awesome!
Thanks, Chase.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.525
And the highlight
of the parade...

12:40.527 --> 12:41.493
is in pieces?

12:41.495 --> 12:43.094
Sky, aren't you
going to skywrite?

12:43.096 --> 12:46.731
It looks more like
you're going to "sky-wrong."

12:46.733 --> 12:48.566
(Chuckling)
Very funny.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.469
We're attaching containers
to Skye's helicopter,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.772
so she can skywrite
a big surprise.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.740
Will you be ready in time?

12:55.742 --> 12:58.743
Yup. Just have to
put things back together.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.545
And this puppy's gonna fly!

13:00.547 --> 13:01.646
(Barking)

13:01.648 --> 13:02.447
(Growling)

13:02.449 --> 13:04.649
Rubble's having
a little trouble

13:04.651 --> 13:06.684
with his decorations.

13:06.686 --> 13:07.552
(Growling)

13:07.554 --> 13:08.987
I'm trying to
fill my bucket loader

13:08.989 --> 13:11.723
full of grey balloons
to look like rocks,

13:11.725 --> 13:14.392
but look what happens!

13:17.597 --> 13:18.329
(Sighing)

13:18.331 --> 13:20.832
I really didn't
think this through.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.334
(Laughing)

13:24.571 --> 13:26.437
Ooh, I love Adventure Bay Day,

13:26.439 --> 13:28.439
especially the blow-up pups.
(Bell ringing)

13:28.441 --> 13:30.975
Oh, here comes
Katie and her float.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.344
Hold these, please.
(Laughing)

13:33.346 --> 13:36.247
Cool tub, Katie.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.949
Yes, very cute float.

13:37.951 --> 13:38.883
Thanks, Mayor Goodway.

13:38.885 --> 13:42.887
Those pink balloons look
especially bubble bath bubbly.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.923
(Clucking)

13:44.925 --> 13:48.393
(Clucking)

13:48.395 --> 13:50.595
(Hissing)
(Clucking)

13:50.597 --> 13:51.563
(Snickering)

13:51.565 --> 13:53.565
(Clucking)
(Groaning)

13:53.567 --> 13:56.067
I'd never be ready without
your help. Thanks, Alex.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.804
No problem, Katie.
I love balloons,

13:59.806 --> 14:02.974
lots and lots of balloons.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.411
Huh? Maybe that's
too many balloons.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.812
Ah! Oh, no!

14:07.814 --> 14:09.113
Callie!

14:09.115 --> 14:10.748
(Yowling)
(Clucking)

14:10.750 --> 14:14.853
(Gasping)
Oh, my precious purse chicken!

14:14.855 --> 14:16.788
Chickaletta!

14:16.790 --> 14:18.823
Come back!

14:18.825 --> 14:20.592
No!
(Yowling and clucking)

14:20.594 --> 14:22.694
Callie!

14:22.696 --> 14:27.265
(Yowling)

14:27.267 --> 14:28.433
Look, the tub stopped!

14:28.435 --> 14:31.402
But Chickaletta
doesn't drink lemonade.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.537
What should we do?

14:32.539 --> 14:35.306
I know!
Call the PAW Patrol.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.742
Wait, I'll call
the PAW Patrol.

Katie's parade float

Oh, I'd love a good
scrub in a floating tub!

16:12.939 --> 16:14.973
With Callie and
Chickaletta in it.

16:14.975 --> 16:18.509
The tub is caught on the
lemonade stand's giant straw.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.744
We have to save the pets

ladder to bring Callie

16:28.254 --> 16:30.655

Chase, I need you to use
your megaphone and safety cones

to keep an area clear
for the tub to land.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.665
Chase is on the case!

finish decorating your floats.

getting her helicopter ready

16:48.541 --> 16:49.574

16:49.576 --> 16:51.943

I'll make sure you can fly.

16:55.648 --> 16:56.314

Heading to the parade for
my big skywriting performance.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.116
Sorry, that'll have to wait.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.452
I need you over here
to get Marshall and Callie

20:54.454 --> 20:57.421
down from the
float away bathtub float.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.089
<i> Hurry!</i>

20:58.091 --> 21:01.459
Let's take to the sky!

21:02.996 --> 21:05.096
Skye!

21:05.098 --> 21:06.297
Marshall!

21:06.299 --> 21:08.432
Boy, am I glad to see you.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.635
(Barking)

21:11.704 --> 21:13.237
SKYE:
Grab on!

21:13.239 --> 21:14.839
Look, no paws.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.774
(Gasping)

21:19.679 --> 21:24.015
Yes! You're safe and
right between my cones.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.383
(Howling)

21:25.385 --> 21:29.287
(Howling)
Yes! Solid ground!

21:30.023 --> 21:32.690
Callie! I'm so glad you're safe.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.459
But the tub's
still floating away!

21:35.461 --> 21:38.729
Chase, use your tennis ball
cannon to pop some balloons.

21:38.731 --> 21:42.233
(Barking)
Tennis ball cannon!

21:45.371 --> 21:47.738
(Chase barking)

21:49.509 --> 21:50.608
It's working!

21:50.610 --> 21:53.544
(Barking)

21:54.914 --> 21:56.847
Pardon me, folks.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.716
Hold on.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.885
(Panting)
Watch out.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.721
Oh, no. Excuse me.

22:03.723 --> 22:04.488
Yes!

22:04.490 --> 22:07.825
Chase is... on the... case.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.294
Thank you so much, Ryder.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.362
And the PAW Patrol.

22:11.364 --> 22:13.931
Whenever you're in trouble,
just yelp for help.

22:13.933 --> 22:18.336
I think we can finally begin
the Adventure Bay Day parade!

22:18.338 --> 22:22.473

22:22.475 --> 22:23.841
<i> (Communicator beeping)</i>

22:23.843 --> 22:25.343
You're on, Skye.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.011
This pup's gotta fly!

22:27.013 --> 22:28.045
(Cheering)

22:28.047 --> 22:30.381
(Barking)

22:31.351 --> 22:33.551

That's so cool!

22:40.827 --> 22:42.393
MAYOR:
Amazing!

22:42.395 --> 22:44.528

Great job, Skye!
