00:05.129 --> 00:08.179
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.199 --> 00:12.140
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.060
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.039
They were good.

00:17.059 --> 00:20.070
[theme music]

00:22.179 --> 00:26.179
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.199 --> 00:28.030
He was bad.

00:28.050 --> 00:31.170
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.190 --> 00:34.070
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.090 --> 00:36.189
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.210 --> 00:38.170
[laughing]

00:38.189 --> 00:41.159
Ooh! Oh, I'll get you!

00:41.179 --> 00:44.210
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:44.229 --> 00:47.079
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.100 --> 00:51.109
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.130 --> 00:55.189
And if you are good,
you may just catch a glimpse

00:55.210 --> 00:57.130
of the Smurfs.

01:00.049 --> 01:02.170
[instrumental music]

01:06.170 --> 01:09.120
Oh, all my life I've searched

01:09.140 --> 01:12.010
for the lost treasure
of the Ancient Trolls.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.090
And what have I got
to show for it?

01:14.109 --> 01:15.189
Nothing but bad feet

01:15.210 --> 01:18.109
and a worn-out
treasure detector!

01:18.129 --> 01:22.030
I've had it with
this worthless piece of junk!

01:23.140 --> 01:24.189
thud

01:26.210 --> 01:28.049
What in the..

01:29.200 --> 01:31.090
Whoa!

01:31.109 --> 01:35.030
Wait! S-slow down! Hold it!

01:35.049 --> 01:37.120
Not so fast!

01:37.140 --> 01:40.020
[gasping]

01:40.039 --> 01:41.159
I don't believe it!

01:41.180 --> 01:45.079
The lost treasure
of the Ancient Trolls!

01:45.099 --> 01:49.189
At last! It's mine, all mine!

01:49.210 --> 01:52.090
Halt, trespasser.

01:52.109 --> 01:53.129
[screaming]

01:53.150 --> 01:55.039
[imp whimpering]

01:55.060 --> 01:57.140
(imp)
'Who are you?'

01:57.159 --> 02:01.049
I am the spirit
of the Ancient Trolls

02:01.069 --> 02:03.150
and you are an evil imp.

02:03.170 --> 02:06.049
Uh, nobody's perfect.

02:06.069 --> 02:07.209
'Silence, fool!'

02:07.230 --> 02:10.169
No one may claim
this abandoned treasure

02:10.189 --> 02:14.009
until they have
proven themselves worthy.

02:14.030 --> 02:17.180
Oh! Oh, but I am worthy.
I am, I am.

02:17.199 --> 02:19.199
Then you must prove it

02:19.219 --> 02:23.120
by braving the dangers
of Dreadful Hollow

02:23.139 --> 02:25.210
and bringing back three things

02:25.229 --> 02:28.090
a feather
from the giant vulture

02:28.110 --> 02:31.039
fire from the volcano

02:31.060 --> 02:34.090
and the fabled blue diamond

02:34.110 --> 02:36.060
from its cave.

02:36.079 --> 02:38.199
B-b-but that's impossible!

02:38.219 --> 02:41.090
There is another way.

02:41.110 --> 02:42.099
Somehow..

02:42.120 --> 02:44.129
[chuckles]
...you must convince

02:44.150 --> 02:46.210
a fair maiden with a pure heart

02:47.000 --> 02:49.139
to marry you.

02:49.159 --> 02:52.229
But-but that's impossible, too!

02:53.009 --> 02:54.219
I know.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.229
But I have spoken!

02:59.180 --> 03:01.189
Wait!

03:01.210 --> 03:05.110
Open up! Give me a chance. Hey!

03:07.180 --> 03:10.199
[instrumental music]

03:15.039 --> 03:17.060
[gasps]
Oops! Uh..

03:20.219 --> 03:21.229
knock knock

03:22.009 --> 03:24.219
- Password.
- Uh, sarsaparilla.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.199
[indistinct chatter]

03:30.219 --> 03:32.110
Order in the smurf!

03:32.129 --> 03:36.229
[clears throat]
As you know, Papa Smurf
has a birthday coming up

03:37.009 --> 03:39.110
and our problem
is how to celebrate it.

03:39.129 --> 03:42.030
[indistinct chatter]

03:42.229 --> 03:44.150
Quiet!

03:44.170 --> 03:46.039
One smurf at a time.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.009
Let's have a beauty contest.

03:48.030 --> 03:50.099
I hate beauty contests.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.120
Uh, how about
a pie-eating contest?

03:52.139 --> 03:54.069
I hate pie.

03:54.090 --> 03:57.060
[yawns]
Ah, let's have a slumber party.

03:57.079 --> 04:00.000
I hate party.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.189
How about a serenade?

04:01.210 --> 04:04.110
[indistinct chatter]

04:05.020 --> 04:08.080
I hate yelling!

04:08.099 --> 04:09.180
Ooh, I know.

04:09.199 --> 04:11.210
Why not
put all our talents together

04:11.229 --> 04:13.159
into one big Smurf show?

04:13.180 --> 04:17.170
Yeah. Like, uh, then we can
each smurf our own thing.

04:17.189 --> 04:19.189
And then let's keep it a secret.

04:19.209 --> 04:22.079
Then we'll really surprise
Papa Smurf.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.120
- Yeah.
- That's good.

04:23.139 --> 04:25.120
[indistinct chatter]

04:25.139 --> 04:27.040
Well, well, then it's agreed.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.129
We'll start practice
first thing in the morning.

04:29.149 --> 04:31.170
- 'Alright!'
- 'Wonderful!'

04:31.189 --> 04:35.069
Practice?
I don't need to practice.

04:35.090 --> 04:37.220
Practice makes perfect,
Smurfette.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.090
Practice makes boring.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.060
[birds chirping]

04:44.220 --> 04:48.209
Okay, Smurfs, let's get started
with the practice.

04:48.230 --> 04:49.199
Hit it!

04:49.220 --> 04:52.230
[instrumental music]

04:54.019 --> 04:57.060
Why did the chicken
smurf across the road?

04:57.079 --> 05:00.160
Uh, 'cause the hen
egged him on.

05:00.180 --> 05:03.139
[both laughing]

05:04.129 --> 05:08.100
And now, here's Greedy!

05:11.110 --> 05:14.009
Greedy, what's wrong?
You get nervous?

05:14.029 --> 05:15.209
Nope.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.089
Hungry.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.149
[Smurfs laughing]

05:19.170 --> 05:22.189

[snoring]

05:26.149 --> 05:28.220
[Smurfs laughing]

05:30.069 --> 05:32.129
Smurfette, you're just in time
to practice

05:32.149 --> 05:34.060
our smurf-dancing routine.

05:34.079 --> 05:38.040
Oh, don't be silly.
Practice is for the birds.

05:38.060 --> 05:40.149
But, Smurfette, we'll never be
good enough for the show

05:40.170 --> 05:41.220
if we don't practice.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.069
Oh, really, Handy.

05:43.090 --> 05:46.180
Anybody can smurf-dance. Watch.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.060
A little dance music, please.

05:48.079 --> 05:51.100
[instrumental music]

05:54.159 --> 05:57.019
[Smurfs laughing]

05:57.040 --> 05:59.230
You see what I mean, Smurfette?
We need to practice.

06:00.009 --> 06:03.079
Oh, no, we don't.
I was just warming up.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.029
Okay, Smurfs, hit it.

06:05.050 --> 06:08.069
[instrumental music]

06:12.029 --> 06:15.000
Eat your hearts out, boys.

06:15.019 --> 06:17.160
[Smurfs laughing]

06:21.069 --> 06:24.230
Ooh, just wait!
I'll show them I'm a star.

06:25.009 --> 06:28.029
There has to be an easier way
to learn how to dance

06:28.050 --> 06:30.149
without all that dumb practice.

06:30.170 --> 06:33.029
There has to be an easier way.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.230
[sobbing]
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. It's not fair.

06:36.009 --> 06:40.029
Ah, a fair maiden
with a pure heart.

06:40.050 --> 06:43.199
Uh, cheer up, my dear.
Help is here.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.129
Oh! An imp!

06:45.149 --> 06:48.149
Ah, but not just any imp.

06:48.170 --> 06:53.090
[kissing]
I can make your dreams
come true.

06:53.110 --> 06:56.029
Oh, smurf-dancer divine.

06:56.050 --> 06:57.159
Wh-wh-what do you mean?

06:57.180 --> 07:00.009
Simple. Watch.

07:01.019 --> 07:02.170
With these special shoes

07:02.189 --> 07:05.040
'you'll be the hottest hoofer
in the village.'

07:05.060 --> 07:09.120
And best of all,
no practice necessary.

07:09.139 --> 07:11.199
Go ahead, try 'em.

07:11.220 --> 07:13.120
snap

07:13.139 --> 07:17.009
Wow, I can dance! I can dance!

07:17.029 --> 07:19.000
Like a goddess!

07:19.019 --> 07:21.089
Oh, how can I ever thank you?

07:21.110 --> 07:22.199
Don't thank me, my dear.

07:22.220 --> 07:25.199
One day you will repay
the favor.

07:25.220 --> 07:29.000
Oh, yes, you can count on that.

07:29.019 --> 07:31.170
Good. Au revoir, fair maiden.

07:31.189 --> 07:36.050
And remember, there's
no business like shoe business.

07:36.069 --> 07:37.149
[laughing]

07:37.170 --> 07:40.069
Whee! Now I'll show them.

07:40.090 --> 07:43.180
I'll be the greatest
smurf-dancer of all time.

07:43.199 --> 07:46.100
[instrumental music]

07:47.069 --> 07:48.060
Hefty!

07:48.079 --> 07:51.170
Huh? Oh! Uh-oh! Oh!

07:54.230 --> 07:57.220
He-Hefty, I-I'm ready to dance.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.129
Sorry, Smurfette,
practice is over.

08:00.149 --> 08:03.009
Who needs practice? Watch this.

08:03.029 --> 08:06.040
[instrumental music]

08:08.110 --> 08:10.069
- Ooh!
- Oh!

Ah!

08:15.029 --> 08:17.160
[indistinct chatter]

08:18.160 --> 08:21.040
A star is born!

08:21.060 --> 08:22.129
Oh, gosh, Smurfette

08:22.149 --> 08:25.000
you must have done
a whole lot of practicing.

08:25.019 --> 08:27.120
Practice? No.

08:27.139 --> 08:30.199
When you've got it,
you've got it.

08:33.049 --> 08:34.220
[Smurfette humming]

08:35.000 --> 08:37.058
(Smurfette)
Boy, did I knock 'em dead.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.100
Ooh, I'll be the hit
of the show.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.100
I can feel it in my feet.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.000
Good afternoon, fair maiden.

08:44.019 --> 08:47.059
The time has come
to repay my favor.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.210
Oh, sure. Anything.

08:50.230 --> 08:54.179
Good, because I want your hand.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.220
[kissing]

08:56.000 --> 08:58.110
- My hand?
- In marriage.

08:58.129 --> 09:00.190
In marriage? B-b-but--

09:00.210 --> 09:04.100
You promised.
And a deal is a deal, my dear.

09:04.120 --> 09:08.159
Well, I won't do it!
You can't make me.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.220
[door opens

09:12.009 --> 09:14.000
Oh, boo-hoo!

09:14.019 --> 09:18.090
I've done something terrible,
and now I'm in big trouble!

09:18.110 --> 09:20.059
What trouble, Smurfette?

09:20.080 --> 09:25.059
[sobbing]
Oh, I'm not really the great
smurf-dancer you think I am.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.120
These magic shoes
did it all for me.

09:28.139 --> 09:30.000
I got them from an imp.

09:30.019 --> 09:33.220
And-and now he says
I have to marry him!

09:34.000 --> 09:36.090
Oh, boo-hoo!

09:36.110 --> 09:39.129
Oh, don't worry, Smurfette.
We'll handle him.

knock knock

09:41.009 --> 09:42.019
Smurfette!

09:42.039 --> 09:44.210
We mustn't be late
for the wedding.

09:44.230 --> 09:46.039
[laughing]

09:46.059 --> 09:47.200
She's not going anywhere.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.230
Uh, yeah, so you better leave

09:50.009 --> 09:51.070
if you don't want some trouble.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.070
Oh, there won't be any trouble.

09:54.090 --> 09:56.169
No trouble at all.

09:56.190 --> 09:59.080
Oh! Help. These shoes!

09:59.100 --> 10:01.049
I, I-I can't stop them!

Come, my bouncing bride!

Let me go! Help!

Come back here, smurf-napper!

10:12.149 --> 10:14.169
[indistinct yelling]

10:15.210 --> 10:19.000
We gotta tell Papa Smurf, fast!

10:19.019 --> 10:20.149
Tomorrow is my birthday

10:20.169 --> 10:22.220
and the Smurfs
haven't said a word.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.090
In fact,
they seem to be ignoring me.

10:26.110 --> 10:29.159
(Smurfs)
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

10:29.179 --> 10:33.200
Ah, I knew they'd remember
their Papa Smurf.

Papa Smurf, where are you?

10:41.059 --> 10:43.129
- Here.
- Oh, Papa Smurf.

10:43.149 --> 10:44.139
We've gotta hurry.

10:44.159 --> 10:46.120
Smurfette has been smurf-napped!

10:46.139 --> 10:47.230
- What?
- By an evil imp!

10:48.009 --> 10:49.039
We tried to catch him

10:49.059 --> 10:50.139
but he was too fast for us.

10:50.159 --> 10:54.009
Then we'll follow his tracks
until we find him.

There it is.

'The imp's castle.'

11:12.039 --> 11:14.029
And there's Smurfette.

11:16.039 --> 11:18.200
(Dreamy)
But look
who's keeping her company.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.019
Quietly now.

11:20.039 --> 11:23.039
We can float across the moat
on this log.

I guess we'll have to find
another way.

I think I've got it!

[sniffles]
Oh, if only I'd practiced

11:34.039 --> 11:36.190
instead of looking
for an easy way out..

11:36.210 --> 11:40.210
Oh, boo-hoo.
I'll never see my Smurfs again.

11:41.129 --> 11:42.110
[gasps]

11:42.129 --> 11:43.100
I only wish

11:43.120 --> 11:45.149
I'd practiced a little more.

11:45.169 --> 11:48.059
Oh, Hefty, you made it.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.179
[cheering]

11:49.200 --> 11:52.120
[snoring]

11:52.139 --> 11:53.190
[grunting]

11:53.210 --> 11:56.210
- Oh, yeah!
- Shh!

11:56.230 --> 11:58.049
[grunts]

11:59.210 --> 12:02.220
[intense music]

12:05.129 --> 12:08.019
[screaming]

12:09.009 --> 12:12.019
[gibberish]

12:14.179 --> 12:15.230
Hang on, Smurfs.

12:16.009 --> 12:18.139
[gibberish]

12:20.080 --> 12:23.169
I'll make an adorable
bridegroom, don't you think?

12:23.190 --> 12:26.080
[gibberish]

12:27.039 --> 12:29.059
[indistinct yelling]

12:29.080 --> 12:33.159
What's this? A bunch
of little blue party crashers?

12:33.179 --> 12:35.129
Let me at him! Let me at him!

12:35.149 --> 12:38.149
Imp, I command you
to set Smurfette free.

12:38.169 --> 12:41.149
Aah! Give me
one good reason why.

12:41.169 --> 12:44.169
'Cause we all love her
and you don't.

12:44.190 --> 12:47.039
True, very true.

12:47.059 --> 12:51.009
Okay, out of the kindness
of my heart..

12:51.029 --> 12:52.220
[laughing]

12:53.000 --> 12:55.179
...I will give you Smurfs
one chance

12:55.200 --> 12:57.190
to save your Smurfette.

12:57.210 --> 13:02.039
You must go to Dreadful Hollow
and bring back three things.

13:02.059 --> 13:05.000
A feather from the giant vulture

13:05.019 --> 13:07.120
fire from the volcano..

13:07.139 --> 13:09.039
[gargoyles laughing]

13:09.059 --> 13:13.080
'...and the blue diamond
from its cave.'

13:13.100 --> 13:15.100
A p-piece of cake.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.169
[sighs]

13:17.190 --> 13:19.159
My friends
will show you the way.

13:19.179 --> 13:22.009
(imp)
'And be back
by sunrise tomorrow'

13:22.029 --> 13:24.230
'or Smurfette will be my bride.'

13:25.009 --> 13:27.090
'Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha.'

13:27.110 --> 13:31.129
Come, my little blue
bride-to-be, let's celebrate

13:31.149 --> 13:34.039
and also bid farewell
to your Smurfs

13:34.059 --> 13:37.230
for they'll never leave
Dreadful Hollow alive!

13:38.009 --> 13:40.230
[imp and gargoyle laughing]

13:41.210 --> 13:44.220
[intense music]

13:46.190 --> 13:50.129
That's it. Run, you big lizards!
We're not afraid!

13:50.149 --> 13:52.220
- 'Yeah.'
- Much.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.029
[bats screeching]

13:59.070 --> 14:03.100
N-now I know why they call it
D-D-Dreadful Hollow.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.110
Since we only have until sunrise

14:05.129 --> 14:07.200
we better split
into three groups.

14:07.220 --> 14:11.019
Hefty, you take a team
to get the vulture's feather.

14:11.039 --> 14:13.129
Yes, sir!

14:13.149 --> 14:15.059
(Papa Smurf)
'Handy, your group is in charge'

14:15.080 --> 14:17.149
'of getting the flame
from the volcano.'

14:17.169 --> 14:19.159
[gulps]
Yes, Papa Smurf.

14:19.179 --> 14:21.100
And you three follow me.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.059
We'll seek the blue diamond.

14:24.080 --> 14:27.120
[all gulping]
Yes, Papa Smurf.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.169
[instrumental music]

14:29.190 --> 14:32.159
I say we owe Papa Smurf
a debt of gratitude

14:32.179 --> 14:35.129
for giving us
the easiest assignment.

14:35.149 --> 14:39.019
How hard can it be
to get a feather from a bird?

14:39.039 --> 14:41.120
[vulture squawks]

14:41.139 --> 14:43.039
Then again..

14:43.059 --> 14:44.139
[squawks]

14:44.159 --> 14:48.009
We'll never get a feather
from that monster.

14:48.029 --> 14:50.159
Oh, don't worry. I have a plan!

14:53.009 --> 14:54.149
(Hefty)
'There's bound to be
plenty of feathers'

14:54.169 --> 14:55.230
'lying around in its nest.'

14:56.009 --> 14:58.100
'So we'll just climb up
and get one.'

14:58.120 --> 15:01.129
[intense music]

15:02.220 --> 15:04.149
Hey, hey, hey!

15:04.169 --> 15:08.220
Hey, this is going to be
easier than I thought.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.129
[breathing heavily]
As Papa Smurf says

15:11.149 --> 15:15.159
"There's nothing to fear
if you look before you leap!"

15:17.080 --> 15:19.200
[squawking]

15:21.009 --> 15:23.039
Uh, there's plenty of feathers
in here

15:23.059 --> 15:24.129
but they all have owners.

15:24.149 --> 15:27.049
[vultures squawking]

15:28.009 --> 15:30.100
Help! Help!

15:30.120 --> 15:33.190
Put me down! Put me down!

15:33.210 --> 15:36.110
Aah! Pick me up! Pick me up!

15:36.129 --> 15:37.169
Clumsy!

15:38.129 --> 15:39.120
splash

15:39.139 --> 15:41.070
Oh, no!

15:41.090 --> 15:43.159
'Help!'

15:43.179 --> 15:46.009
[volcano rumbling]

15:46.029 --> 15:48.070
[intense music]

15:49.169 --> 15:51.230
We're almost there.
And no problems yet.

15:52.009 --> 15:55.210
Oh, yeah? Look what this heat's
doing to my complexion.

15:55.230 --> 16:00.029
Yeah, I've got a sinking feeling
we're in big trouble.

16:00.049 --> 16:01.200
Oh, fiddlesmurfs, Greedy.

16:01.220 --> 16:04.059
You're letting
your imagination run wild.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.129
[Greedy panting]

16:05.149 --> 16:07.009
(Greedy)
Help!

16:07.029 --> 16:09.070
- 'Greedy!'
- Help!

16:09.090 --> 16:11.000
[mumbling]

16:11.230 --> 16:14.019
Well, Smurfs, the blue diamond

16:14.039 --> 16:16.149
is right in that cave.

16:16.169 --> 16:18.049
(Harmony)
'It's so quiet.'

16:18.070 --> 16:20.000
(Dreamy)
'Yeah, it doesn't look like'

16:20.019 --> 16:22.029
'there's anything
to be afraid of.'

16:22.049 --> 16:24.169
That's what I'm afraid of.

16:24.190 --> 16:26.049
I hate afraid.

16:26.070 --> 16:29.019
- 'Grouchy, stop!'
- Huh?

16:29.039 --> 16:30.120
thud

16:32.169 --> 16:35.139
From now on, I lead the way.

16:35.159 --> 16:39.049
Help! Somebody, help!

16:39.070 --> 16:42.230
(Hefty)
Clumsy, smurf like
you've never smurfed before!

16:43.009 --> 16:45.149
[Smurfs grunting]

16:47.110 --> 16:50.000
Clumsy, grab the log!

16:50.019 --> 16:53.049
Ah, I got the log!
Where's the brake?

16:53.070 --> 16:55.080
Don't worry about a thing!

16:55.100 --> 16:57.169
I'll worry for both of us.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.210
[Clumsy screaming]

16:59.230 --> 17:01.120
[Smurfs cheering]

17:01.139 --> 17:03.049

17:04.049 --> 17:05.170
Ah!

17:31.049 --> 17:34.009
Yipes!
This thing is about to erupt.

17:34.029 --> 17:36.009
And Smurfette's
about to get married

17:36.029 --> 17:38.170
unless we light this torch
in time!

17:39.160 --> 17:42.049
Okay, lower away.

17:42.069 --> 17:44.059
That's it, steady.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.180
Uh, a little more.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
- Got it!
- 'Hurray!'

17:54.119 --> 17:57.109
Quick, smurf me up. Smurf me up.

17:57.130 --> 18:00.079

Pull! Pull! Pull!

18:10.220 --> 18:12.210
I wanna go home.

Yeah, uh, yeah,
ha-hang, hang on.

I do like Hefty says.

Okay. Okay, bird, you win.

Run, Smurfs, run!

Uh, and Papa Smurf?

20:01.079 --> 20:04.069
- We don't know.
- And we're really worried.

(Papa Smurf)
'Well, what are you
smurfing around for?'

have obviously failed.'

you requested.

You succeeded!

20:33.059 --> 20:36.029
I-i-incredible! Give them to me.

20:36.049 --> 20:38.190
Wait. You must release
Smurfette first.

20:38.210 --> 20:41.069
You would give me orders?

20:41.089 --> 20:44.000
Gargoyles,
collect my wedding gifts

20:44.019 --> 20:46.150
and rid my kingdom
of these pests.

these shoes are stuck tight.

Oh, I know. But please
keep trying, Papa Smurf.

21:41.230 --> 21:43.210
Enough of this nonsense!

I have the goodies
and Smurfette.

21:47.150 --> 21:50.150
Whoa! Papa Smurf, I can't stop!

21:50.170 --> 21:53.130
And soon, the treasure
of the Ancient Trolls

21:53.150 --> 21:55.049
will also be mine.

this wasn't exactly

22:47.079 --> 22:49.119
what we had in mind
for your birthday

22:49.140 --> 22:50.180
but enjoy the show!
