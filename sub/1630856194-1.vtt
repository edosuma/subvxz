and more efficient *

searching for inspiration *

[Hayden]
Channeling your inner Pollock?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.131
Hey, Hayden!

00:48.173 --> 00:52.218
No, this is just
good old fashioned rage.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.597
I got tired of the blank canvas
staring back at me.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.892
Do you need me out front? I'm
just finishing my lunch break.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.352
No, no, we got you covered.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.021
Just wanted to chat with you
when you have a sec.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.564
Come up to my office
when you're done.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.775
Take your time.

01:07.692 --> 01:08.943
Good progress.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.363
[instrumental music]

01:12.322 --> 01:13.865
[sighs]

01:13.907 --> 01:15.700
Progress.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.244
[Hayden] What I'll do is
send it over to you...

01:18.286 --> 01:20.163
Let me call you right back.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.539
Olivia, hi. Come in.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.375
Just close the door
behind you there.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.753
Have a seat.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.090
Look, I know I have been
saying this every week,

01:30.131 --> 01:32.258
but you've been
absolutely killing it.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.719
I'm serious, you are
one of the best curators

01:34.761 --> 01:37.764
the NYGYA has ever had.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.724
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.355
Which is why
this is so difficult.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.233
I found out that our grant
hasn't been renewed

01:48.274 --> 01:50.026
and unfortunately, we're
not going to be

01:50.068 --> 01:52.153
able to keep all of our staff.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.118
-I don't have a job?
-No, no, no, I didn't say that.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.621
I live in Williamsburg
and it's Christmas

02:01.663 --> 02:03.498
and I don't have a job?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.417
Olivia, you still have a job.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.461
You have a job for now,

02:08.503 --> 02:12.340
but I don't know what next year
is going to look like.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.300
And I'm sorry 'cause I know that
this isn't the news you wanted

02:14.342 --> 02:16.469
to hear before you went back
home for your Christmas break.

02:16.511 --> 02:20.306
It's just that I wanted to give
you plenty of heads up

02:20.348 --> 02:24.144
as a friend in case... you
wanted to start looking.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.521
[instrumental music]

02:26.563 --> 02:27.564
[sighs]

02:29.315 --> 02:31.317
Come on, Parker,
let's get going.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.071
What are we gonna
do about this?

02:35.113 --> 02:36.322
Can I keep it?

02:37.323 --> 02:38.616
You really like it?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.202
I think it looks like
one of those...

02:41.244 --> 02:44.664
What's her name? Jackie Pollock?

02:44.706 --> 02:46.041
Jackson Pollock.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.334
He's a dude.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.671
Are you sure Santa
won't get confused

02:51.713 --> 02:55.467
that we'll be in New Hampshire
this year instead of New York?

02:55.508 --> 02:58.219
Well, the guy does deliver
presents to the entire world.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.347
I doubt this is the first time
that's come up.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.849
Okay.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.977
How about I ask
grandpa to text Santa

03:06.019 --> 03:08.229
and tell him that we'll be
at their place this year?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.857
-Does that sound good?
-Can you have grandma do it?

03:10.899 --> 03:13.193
Grandpa really doesn't know
how to use his phone.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.486
[chuckles]

03:14.527 --> 03:16.488
Good call.
Watch your head, kiddo.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.700
* It's Christmas time

03:23.161 --> 03:27.332
* Can you see
all the snow falling? *

03:27.374 --> 03:32.754
* We got to have a good time
together *

03:35.382 --> 03:37.258
Do you see the lights, buddy?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.386
Yeah, so nice.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.845
Pretty beautiful, huh?

03:44.432 --> 03:49.354
Here they are.
My early Christmas presents.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.815
-Hi!
-Grandma! Grandpa!

03:51.856 --> 03:56.069
Ah, come here sport.
[laughing] Ooh.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.988
Oh, there's a fresh batch
of cookies

03:59.030 --> 04:00.740
someone needs to
taste test for me.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.660
-I'll do it for you, grandma.
-[Betty] Okay, have at it.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.371
Have you guys been waiting out
here the whole drive over?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.456
A couple hours, give or take.
[laughs]

04:08.498 --> 04:10.041
And still getting
used to this retirement thing.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.085
That sounds like
a lovely problem.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.963
[chuckles] Go give your mama a
hug. You know how she gets.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.923
[Mack chuckles]

04:16.965 --> 04:19.426
-Oh, good to see you.
-Hmmm.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.470
We're so excited you came up
for Christmas this year.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.431
Us, too. Sorry, I...

04:24.472 --> 04:27.434
-I know it's overdue.
-And how's Parker?

04:27.475 --> 04:30.812
I saw that he had
Tom's plate with him.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.605
Is he still having
trouble in school?

04:32.647 --> 04:34.566
Well, his grades are better,

04:34.607 --> 04:37.485
but he's still having a hard
time making friends.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.403
Aww.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.446
I think it's gonna be really

04:39.487 --> 04:41.614
good for him to be back here.

04:41.656 --> 04:45.118
I know I'm excited to take
a couple weeks off work

04:45.160 --> 04:47.579
and have a nice,
relaxing Christmas.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.041
Parker, you can have
one more cookie, okay, bud?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.042
Then it's time for bed.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.586
[Parker] Okay, mom. Coming!

04:57.922 --> 05:00.342
[mellow music]

05:02.719 --> 05:04.554
[door opens]

05:06.681 --> 05:07.974
[switch clicks]

05:17.692 --> 05:18.610
[sighs]

05:34.209 --> 05:36.169
-Morning, everyone.
-Hey!

05:36.211 --> 05:37.837
-Hey, morning!
-Hey, bud.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.383
Have you brushed
your teeth yet?

05:42.550 --> 05:43.385
No.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.390
Perfect timing, kiddo.
Just made a fresh pot.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.974
You sleep okay?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.685
Yeah.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.687
It's always a little weird
sleeping in there.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.815
It's like a time capsule to
my awkward teenage years.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.191
Uh-oh. [chuckles]

05:58.233 --> 05:59.401
I think the only thing
that's different

05:59.442 --> 06:01.528
is seeing my painting
on the wall.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.363
Well, it's only right

06:03.405 --> 06:05.699
that the painting hangs
in the artist's room.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.368
We're hanging on to it to sell,
when you make it big.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.744
So hurry up.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.871
[laughs]

06:11.913 --> 06:14.749
Uh, so, are you
painting anything new?

06:15.959 --> 06:18.044
Trying. I'm just, um...

06:19.504 --> 06:21.423
I guess you could say
inspiration's been

06:21.464 --> 06:24.259
a little dry
the past couple years.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.927
Oh, give it time, honey.

06:25.969 --> 06:29.305
You'll feel that spark again.
I know it.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.392
Yeah, actually, I was thinking

06:32.434 --> 06:35.270
maybe I'll use my time
while here to give it a go.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.855
Oh.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.857
Does this town have
a proper art store yet?

06:38.898 --> 06:42.110
Sure. Aisles eight through ten
at the Wellington Hardware.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.111
[chuckles]

06:45.864 --> 06:48.158
[whimsical music]

06:59.169 --> 07:01.254
Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.464
We need all the entries
we can get.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.883
[Will] Yeah, of course.
Happy to help.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.676
So, uh, we still
on for tonight?

07:06.718 --> 07:07.969
Tribune night is literally

07:08.011 --> 07:09.929
the only social event
in my calendar.

07:09.971 --> 07:10.972
See you there.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.440
You in town
for the Winter Walk?

07:20.482 --> 07:22.901
-Sorry?
-Saw you eyeing the poster.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.028
It's a big deal around here,
people come from all over

07:25.070 --> 07:26.488
to walk Wellington Drive.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.114
Taking the decorations.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.824
Oh, yeah. I-I know.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.577
I grew up here, so I used to
go every year with my parents.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.287
Well, shoot. Look at me blabbing
on like you're a tourist.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.205
No, it's okay.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.456
I haven't been back for the

07:36.498 --> 07:38.124
past couple of Christmases.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.293
It looks like things have
changed, though.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.796
I don't remember a mural
being part of the celebration.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.590
That's a new addition,
thanks to yours truly.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.342
This will be the first year
we try it.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.636
I wish there had been something
like it when I was a kid.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.513
I might have stuck around
a little longer

07:51.554 --> 07:53.932
rather than hopping on
the first train to New York.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.267
New York?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.977
You're Mack
and Betty's daughter.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.479
That's right.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.147
I forgot how small
this town is.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.607
Cody, nice to meet you.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.317
You're an artist, right?

08:04.359 --> 08:07.028
Your mom talked my ear off about
you when she saw the poster.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.655
Of course, she did.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.490
-Never misses an opportunity.
-[laughs]

08:10.532 --> 08:12.617
But, um, yeah. I paint.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.703
Though not as much lately.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.996
Any interest in entering?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.957
Application's easy.
Just submit a piece.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.458
We're choosing
an artist tomorrow.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.960
You can make it
just under the wire.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.670
Oh. Um...

08:24.713 --> 08:26.214
I'm okay, thanks.

08:26.256 --> 08:30.593
I've been trying just to
paint more for me lately.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.846
No-no need to explain.
I just had to ask.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.223
But if you change your mind,
I'll be here, okay?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.017
Sounds good. Thanks, Cody.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.643
See you around.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.688
[sighs]

09:00.415 --> 09:02.959
[clattering]

09:03.001 --> 09:04.669
[Will] You okay over there?

09:04.711 --> 09:07.339
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Here, let me help.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.054
Thank you.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.764
Did I just see you
outside town hall?

09:15.805 --> 09:17.223
Oh, yeah. You might have.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.850
I was admiring the view.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.561
Of the Christmas trees.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.688
Trees. Yeah.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.149
-I'm Will, by the way.
-I'm Olivia.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.650
Nice to meet you.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.652
-Um...
-Oh, yeah.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.696
-Oh, no, you don't...
-That's okay.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.989
-You don't have to help me.
-That's all right.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.616
I was coming back
to this section anyway.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.618
I was hoping to find.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.203
Oh, there it is.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.667
-There it is.
-Oh. Um...

09:43.708 --> 09:46.336
Actually, I was hoping
to snag that one.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.338
It's-it's the last
Mistletoe Green.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.715
I know. I realized
I was one short.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.594
The good news for you

09:54.636 --> 09:57.097
is you've still got some

09:57.138 --> 09:59.808
Chartreuse and some Shamrock
to choose from.

09:59.849 --> 10:03.061
I don't want Shamrock.
I'm not painting a leprechaun.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.939
I'm pretty particular
about my colors.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.691
Okay.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.819
I think I have a solution.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.862
Now, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.323
Something pretty magical happens

10:15.365 --> 10:18.743
when you mix these two together.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.246
You're serious?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.747
You're not gonna give me
one of your tubes?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.499
-You've got like a dozen.
-I have ten.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.626
And ten is
exactly how many I need.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.420
Believe me, if I could
spare one, I would, but...

10:31.047 --> 10:35.802
Tell you what. I'm just gonna
leave these here with you.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.345
And I'm gonna be on my way.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.931
You have a great day.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.434
This is crazy.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.394
You're crazy!

10:44.436 --> 10:46.771
That man is hoarding paint!

10:46.813 --> 10:48.690
Merry Christmas.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.484
I think you're gonna need
a clean-up in aisle eight.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.153
[Will] She's an old friend.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.821
Unbelievable.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.489
[Olivia] I'm still mad about it.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.284
[Betty] Well, maybe he really
did need all that paint.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.870
Some kind of art emergency.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.330
I would really love for you
to be on my side,

11:04.372 --> 11:07.000
instead of some anecdotal man
you've never met.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.169
Well, if it helps,
sweetheart, I don't like him.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.171
Thank you, dad.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.924
Maybe you should channel
that rage into your art.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.136
[Betty] You know, paint a really
mean tree or something.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.890
Yeah, I tried,
but nothing came to me.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.018
Just another blank canvas.

11:25.060 --> 11:28.688
Hey, did you guys hear about
this Christmas mural contest

11:28.730 --> 11:30.565
they're doing for
the Winter Walk?

11:30.607 --> 11:32.692
This guy Cody said that he
talked to you about it, mom.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.986
Oh, he was so nice.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.864
And of course,
we texted you about it.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.866
-No, you didn't.
-No?

11:39.908 --> 11:41.368
Trust me, I remember.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.161
It was about a week ago.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.913
And I told your father
to take a picture

11:44.954 --> 11:47.165
of the poster and to send it to
you. Tell her, honey.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.625
[Mack] That's true,
she did, yeah.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.335
Here, I'll,
I'll prove it to you.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.087
I got it right here.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.925
Here we are.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.510
Oh.

11:58.551 --> 12:03.264
I-I may have texted our
DoorDash delivery guy instead.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.183
[laughing]

12:05.225 --> 12:07.310
Would appreciate
any response, Greg.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.436
[Mack clears throat]

12:08.478 --> 12:09.729
You see why I wanted

12:09.771 --> 12:11.606
grandma to text Santa?

12:11.648 --> 12:13.483
[Betty]
Regardless, now you know.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.944
And I'll tell you now what I
would have told you then.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.320
You should enter.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.780
-Mm-hmm.
-Mom.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.949
Yes, yes, I know
you've hit a dry spell

12:20.990 --> 12:24.536
but maybe this is the nudge you
need to start painting again.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.287
You know, light a fire
under you.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.540
Only one way to find out,
sweetie.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.959
Well, even if I
did want to enter,

12:31.001 --> 12:33.169
I'd have to submit a piece
just to be considered.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.046
[Olivia] And there's no way
that I could paint something

12:35.088 --> 12:37.257
decent by tomorrow.
Even at my best.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.468
It's just not in the cards
right now.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.474
[soft music]

13:13.418 --> 13:15.920
[instrumental music]

13:17.255 --> 13:18.173
[switch clicks]

13:19.549 --> 13:21.843
[indistinct chattering]

13:23.511 --> 13:25.889
It has been way too long.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.516
-New York is not that far away.
-I know.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.809
I'm sorry we haven't been back

13:29.851 --> 13:31.102
for Christmas
the past couple years.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.480
It's just with Tom
and everything.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.647
Yeah.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.149
Anyway, I really appreciate

13:36.191 --> 13:37.650
you staying in touch
through it all.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.153
Of course, I am always
here for you,

13:40.195 --> 13:44.032
even though you abandoned me
for your cool friends in NYC.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.534
So how are things
at Wellington Elementary?

13:46.576 --> 13:48.119
Are you over teaching yet?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.914
Hmm, no, not yet. Still love it.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.416
Except I have to
look into their sweet,

13:53.458 --> 13:54.709
youthful faces every day

13:54.751 --> 13:57.003
and reflect
on my own mortality.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.338
Other than that, it's peachy.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.964
[both laugh]

14:00.006 --> 14:02.008
Mm. How about you?

14:02.050 --> 14:05.095
How's life as a fancy New York
art curator?

14:05.136 --> 14:07.806
It's a little shaky.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.308
We just found out
that we lost our funding.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.937
And so I'm not sure how long
my position is gonna last.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.438
I'm so sorry Olivia.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.816
You know, we're feeling
that at school, too.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.776
I have a friend in
administration who thinks

14:19.818 --> 14:22.862
our art programs are
going to be axed next.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.448
But you're a rockstar
over there.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.075
I'm sure your job's fine.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.328
And in the meantime, you can
focus on your painting.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.040
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Still no luck on that front?

14:34.082 --> 14:35.709
Man, I am batting a 1,000 here.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.502
[both laugh]

14:37.544 --> 14:41.715
I'm trying, but I don't know.
Nothing's coming to me.

14:41.756 --> 14:45.051
It's like I'm paralyzed every
time I pick up a paintbrush.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.887
It's a really fun,
creative space to live in.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.055
[chuckles]

14:50.598 --> 14:51.641
Ah...

14:51.683 --> 14:53.476
I should probably get going.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.562
I'm meeting Parker
and my parents at town hall

14:55.603 --> 14:57.897
for the announcement
about who won the contest.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.941
The least I can do is
support the cause.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.568
Thank you.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.820
I'll catch you later.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.739
[Cody]
Thank you to all the artists

15:05.780 --> 15:07.907
who presented
their best winter art.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.701
As you know, the winner
will design

15:09.743 --> 15:11.786
our town's new Christmas mural

15:11.828 --> 15:14.414
in his or her own style
of choice.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.375
The Community Services
Department

15:17.417 --> 15:20.086
reviewed all of the
incredible pieces of art

15:20.128 --> 15:22.922
that have been submitted
over the past week.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.758
And even though
we had some late entries

15:24.799 --> 15:28.511
to account for even one
being dropped off this morning,

15:28.553 --> 15:31.431
we're pleased to announce
we've selected a winner.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.351
But first...

15:35.894 --> 15:38.229
I'd like to congratulate
our runner up

15:38.271 --> 15:39.439
who'll receive
a gift certificate

15:39.481 --> 15:41.107
to Wellington Hardware.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.152
Let's hear it for
Will Campbell!

15:44.194 --> 15:46.654
[people cheering]

15:46.696 --> 15:47.697
[Cody] Thank you.

15:50.575 --> 15:53.078
Is that my painting?

15:53.828 --> 15:55.288
Mom.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.291
-Tell me you did not do this.
-[Cody] Ladies and gentlemen...

15:58.333 --> 16:00.001
-I don't know what you mean.
-[Cody] I give to you...

16:00.043 --> 16:02.754
the first winner of the
Wellington Winter Walk's

16:02.796 --> 16:05.173
inaugural Christmas mural
contest.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.384
-Oh! Oh!
-[applause]

16:07.425 --> 16:09.386
[Cody]
And here's the artist now.

16:09.427 --> 16:12.263
Fashionably late, but she's
living in New York these days,

16:12.305 --> 16:14.891
so we forgive her.
Please welcome Olivia Carver.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.476
-You won.
-[Cody] Come on up.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.770
[applause]

16:21.898 --> 16:23.483
Congratulations, Olivia.

16:23.525 --> 16:24.693
How about a few words?

16:27.362 --> 16:29.364
Ah... [laughs]

16:30.031 --> 16:31.658
[clears throat]

16:32.992 --> 16:34.285
Um...

16:36.413 --> 16:39.290
Thank you so much
for selecting me.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.502
Uh...

16:43.920 --> 16:45.046
Go mom!

16:45.088 --> 16:47.382
-[laughter]
-[woman] Aww, how cute.

16:51.553 --> 16:52.804
[applause]

16:52.846 --> 16:54.055
[Cody] Everyone, please join us

16:54.097 --> 16:56.057
for the official
mural unveiling on our

16:56.099 --> 16:59.185
Christmas
block party in two weeks.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.980
I think I speak for
Wellington when I say

17:02.022 --> 17:04.733
we're very excited to see where
your imagination leads you.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.362
So the space itself hasn't been
used for about a year,

17:09.404 --> 17:11.740
but the wall you'll be painting
is in a prime spot.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.199
[Cody] Come on.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.203
A lot of traffic is gonna
pass this way.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.205
We're right at the end
of the Winter Walk.

17:19.247 --> 17:22.542
Anybody driving through town
or strolling the shops

17:22.584 --> 17:24.210
is gonna see your work.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.839
[instrumental music]

17:28.882 --> 17:29.924
[chuckles]

17:29.966 --> 17:31.384
Wouldn't that be something?

17:31.426 --> 17:33.178
I still have to show you
the best part.

17:33.887 --> 17:34.929
Come on.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.514
So technically, the Community

17:36.556 --> 17:38.892
Services Department
still owns this space

17:38.933 --> 17:42.562
but ever since we renovated the
community room at town hall,

17:42.604 --> 17:44.814
we haven't really had
a use for it.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.566
Figured you could
use it to work.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.236
She's all yours.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.823
[Cody] If you need anything,
give me a ring at town hall.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.742
And one last thing.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.869
Good luck.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.245
Thanks, Cody.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.427
Pretty big canvas to work with.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.472
What are you doing here?

18:17.514 --> 18:19.349
[Olivia] Have you come to
steal some more paint?

18:19.391 --> 18:22.852
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but I have not bought any yet.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.230
No, no, nothing like that.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.441
I just came to see
what could have been.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.319
Don't get me wrong, I'm,

18:31.361 --> 18:33.655
I'm very proud
to be runner up,

18:33.697 --> 18:38.535
but I was this close to
getting my first real gig.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.537
I'm sorry.

18:40.578 --> 18:44.958
Yeah, yeah, there goes
my big shot down the drain,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.795
which I guess makes us rivals.

18:48.837 --> 18:52.716
Well, don't worry,
I am not a 100% sure

18:52.757 --> 18:55.427
that I'm even doing it yet.
So you still have some hope.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.886
What?

18:56.928 --> 18:59.431
That paint that you stole,

18:59.472 --> 19:00.849
it didn't go to waste.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.936
Your piece was really good

19:04.978 --> 19:07.313
as much as I hate to admit it.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.232
I've always been a fan
of impressionism.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.109
Thank you.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.403
I went through a big
Monet phase in college.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.613
-Hm. Didn't we all?
-I mean, we're only human.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.073
[both laugh]

19:17.115 --> 19:20.076
Um, congratulations.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.328
And I really am looking forward
to seeing what you paint.

19:23.455 --> 19:24.372
Thanks.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.586
But-but just so you know,
if you do chicken out,

19:29.627 --> 19:32.380
I will be there to swoop in
and do what you couldn't.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.217
Wow, you know,
we were so close

19:36.259 --> 19:38.428
to actually having
a nice moment there.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.347
-Honestly, it's a gift.
-Huh.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.933
Well, goodbye.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.810
Try not to freeze out here.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.480
I hope your mural doesn't need
any Mistletoe Green.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.732
[instrumental music]

19:50.774 --> 19:51.608
[scoffs]

19:55.278 --> 19:59.574
Wow, everyone is quite
industrious this evening.

19:59.616 --> 20:02.243
Well, you know what they say
about idle hands.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.412
-Thank you.
-Hm.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.207
Parker, I'm so glad you're
doing this with grandpa.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.250
He's been itching
for some new projects

20:09.292 --> 20:11.169
now that he's home
all the time.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.629
-I'll keep him busy.
-Yeah.

20:12.671 --> 20:13.922
Good work.

20:17.300 --> 20:21.554
Is this art I see
unfolding around me?

20:21.596 --> 20:23.181
I'm just trying to jot down

20:23.223 --> 20:25.308
some design ideas
for the mural.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.810
And how's that going?

20:28.853 --> 20:29.854
[page ripping]

20:29.896 --> 20:31.314
[crumpling]

20:32.315 --> 20:34.150
[Betty] Okay.

20:34.192 --> 20:36.903
Well, even though
it is an uphill battle,

20:36.945 --> 20:40.448
I'm glad to see you giving it
some serious thought.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.118
Well, the least I can do is
go down swinging,

20:43.159 --> 20:46.621
especially with Will on standby
waiting for me to fail.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.164
Will?

20:48.206 --> 20:50.083
The paint thief from
the hardware store.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.376
-Oh.
-He was the runner up.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.461
And he ambushed me
at the mural today.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.797
-Oh.
-He's so frustrating.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.007
I've never met someone

20:57.048 --> 20:58.925
who can bounce from sweet

20:58.967 --> 21:00.885
to obnoxious so gracefully.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.513
That's interesting.

21:03.555 --> 21:07.017
No, it is not like that.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.310
So you can just get
that thought out of your head.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.646
[Betty]
I-I didn't say anything.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.231
Wow.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.484
Hey, I heard you had
coffee with Ivy today.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.319
You guys haven't palled around
in a while.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.572
Yeah, it was really great
catching up.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.448
Good.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.450
I'm actually taking Parker

21:23.491 --> 21:25.827
to visit her at the school
tomorrow.

21:25.869 --> 21:28.580
Apparently, there's this great
after school art class

21:28.621 --> 21:30.165
that one of her colleagues runs.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.168
Mom, do I haveto go?

21:33.209 --> 21:36.463
Come on, bud.
I bet it'll be fun.

21:36.504 --> 21:39.841
Trust me, you are both
gonna like the art teacher.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.384
[bell ringing]

21:41.426 --> 21:42.844
[kids screaming]

21:42.886 --> 21:44.679
[Olivia]
It is so weird being back here.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.682
I know. I have to remind myself
that I'm the adult here.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.601
Oh, we're walking, please.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.687
All right, Parker,

21:52.729 --> 21:54.773
you are going to love
our art project today.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.942
And you're gonna love our new
art teacher. Ready? Okay.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.444
[Will] And remember everyone,
we wanna paint

21:59.486 --> 22:01.654
all the sides
of our ornament, right?

22:01.696 --> 22:03.406
We don't want any bad angles.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.034
Oh, hey.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.494
So listen up, everybody.

22:07.535 --> 22:10.121
We have a special guest today.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.539
What's your name, bud?

22:13.249 --> 22:14.668
His name's Parker.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.422
Great.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.593
Parker, welcome.

22:23.635 --> 22:25.553
Let's get you set up. Okay?

22:25.595 --> 22:28.556
Got a little spot for you
right over here.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.100
[Will] Yeah, lucky for you,
one of our regulars

22:30.141 --> 22:31.393
couldn't make it in today.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.853
Which means
you don't have to share.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.563
That's for you.

22:35.605 --> 22:36.898
You good to get started

22:36.940 --> 22:39.526
while I go talk to your mom
for a sec?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.444
Great. I'll be right back.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.619
You know,
if you wanted to see me,

22:49.661 --> 22:52.080
you didn't have to hire a child
to pretend to be your son.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.666
Wow.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.459
You are really something.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.712
Hm, that's what they tell me.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.255
She told you we've met already?

23:00.296 --> 23:01.464
No.

23:02.799 --> 23:06.094
This is the guy
I was telling you about

23:06.136 --> 23:08.096
from the paint store.

23:08.138 --> 23:10.306
Oh, wow, you're the paint thief.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.809
Okay, that nickname's
really taking off.

23:12.851 --> 23:17.022
Well, at least Parker and the
other children can benefit

23:17.063 --> 23:19.816
from the spoils
of my criminal enterprise.

23:19.858 --> 23:22.610
You could have told me
that you were buying supplies

23:22.652 --> 23:25.238
for a children's after school
art program.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.407
Yeah, but I'm not
the bragging type.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.618
I'm just your average,
humble, down to earth,

23:30.660 --> 23:33.663
handsome, talented,
selfless public educator

23:33.705 --> 23:36.458
who is changing children's
lives one at a time.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.460
[laughs]

23:38.501 --> 23:40.128
Well, it's nice of you
to drop by.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.546
Um, you're welcome to hang out,

23:41.588 --> 23:43.965
but if you two have plans,

23:44.007 --> 23:45.967
I'll be with the kids
for another hour or so.

23:48.845 --> 23:50.680
[Will] Looking good, Parker.

23:50.722 --> 23:51.973
Still up for coffee?

23:53.016 --> 23:54.642
I don't know.

23:54.684 --> 23:58.104
Um, maybe I should
stick around for a while

23:58.146 --> 24:00.148
and make sure Parker's okay.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.941
[Will] So let me guess.

24:01.983 --> 24:05.445
This is Santa's dirty socks,
right?

24:05.487 --> 24:08.198
-They're stockings.
-Oh, stockings.

24:08.239 --> 24:09.491
Yeah, I knew that.
I knew that.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.659
Why don't you wait here
a minute?

24:11.701 --> 24:13.703
I'll go get my jacket
and if you're still feeling

24:13.745 --> 24:17.207
uneasy when I get back, we can
rain check, okay. Sound good?

24:17.248 --> 24:18.541
Yeah. Okay.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.508
Hey, uh, would it be okay if I

24:26.549 --> 24:28.510
pulled up a chair
and painted next to you?

24:28.551 --> 24:30.220
[Will] It's kind of lonely
up at my desk.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.429
[Parker] Sure.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.056
Yeah. Thanks.

24:33.098 --> 24:34.015
I'll be right back.

24:38.895 --> 24:41.272
[mellow music]

24:45.735 --> 24:46.820
[softly chuckles]

24:51.408 --> 24:53.201
All right, all set.

24:53.243 --> 24:54.703
How are we feeling?

24:56.913 --> 24:59.249
You know what?

24:59.290 --> 25:00.583
Let's go get that coffee.

25:01.209 --> 25:02.085
Great.

25:02.877 --> 25:03.962
Bye.

25:18.226 --> 25:19.352
[instrumental music]

25:20.478 --> 25:21.855
[drill whirring]

25:21.896 --> 25:22.647
Nice.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.151
[drill whirring]

25:26.192 --> 25:27.777
Do you think we need
one more or...?

25:30.780 --> 25:32.449
What are you, stalking me now?

25:32.490 --> 25:35.452
No. I found you
via legitimate means.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.787
-I interrogated Ivy.
-[scoffs]

25:37.829 --> 25:40.290
Sorry, I hope I'm not
interrupting. I'm Will.

25:40.331 --> 25:43.251
Will, Mack. Nice to meet you.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.046
Uh, I just wanted to talk
to you about something

25:46.087 --> 25:48.089
before but I didn't want to
bring it up in front of Parker.

25:48.131 --> 25:51.968
Um, but if now is not
a good time.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.678
You know, actually, I was
just gonna head inside

25:53.720 --> 25:55.722
and scope out
the base of operations.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.058
Why don't you two, uh,
chat while she works?

25:59.726 --> 26:01.436
Okay. Thanks, Mack.

26:01.478 --> 26:03.063
-Nice meeting you.
-You too.

26:07.025 --> 26:09.486
So? What's up?

26:09.527 --> 26:11.154
Yeah, I just wanted to
ask you--

26:11.196 --> 26:13.448
[drill whirring]

26:20.080 --> 26:22.957
I wanted to ask you something
about Parker, actually.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.959
Oh.

26:25.001 --> 26:28.588
It's okay. Nothing's wrong.
He did great in class.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.674
I just noticed that he's, uh,

26:30.715 --> 26:33.426
I guess a little apprehensive
around other kids.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.970
Oh. Um...

26:37.597 --> 26:39.099
Yeah.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.809
He's been having some trouble

26:40.850 --> 26:43.269
the past couple of years.

26:43.311 --> 26:46.147
He used to be such
an outgoing kid and then...

26:46.189 --> 26:48.692
when his dad died
he just sort of...

26:48.733 --> 26:51.236
That's gotta be really tough
for both of you.

26:53.738 --> 26:56.241
Have you tried
art therapy for Parker?

26:58.827 --> 27:01.538
Yes. Once. In New York.

27:01.579 --> 27:04.124
-But it didn't really take.
-Hmm.

27:04.916 --> 27:06.376
Why?

27:06.418 --> 27:08.169
Well...

27:08.211 --> 27:10.130
I kinda know what
Parker's going through

27:10.171 --> 27:13.717
and I thought I might help him
the way that it helped me.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.593
My dad passed
when I was thirteen.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.637
Oh, wow.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.890
-I'm so sorry, Will.
-Yeah.

27:20.932 --> 27:24.269
I really didn't know
how to process it at the time.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.147
[Will]
And art therapy just worked.

27:27.188 --> 27:30.650
So I'm actually
a certified art therapist.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.652
Anyway, all that to say,
if you want

27:32.694 --> 27:34.487
I would be happy to
sit down with Parker.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.407
That's really generous.

27:37.449 --> 27:40.785
But we're heading home
in a couple weeks. So...

27:40.827 --> 27:42.454
Yeah. Right. I get it.

27:44.247 --> 27:46.332
If you change your mind though,
I'll be around.

27:46.374 --> 27:47.834
Winter break just started

27:47.876 --> 27:49.919
so I've got plenty of time
on my hands.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.421
Thank you.
I'll-I'll think about it.

27:52.005 --> 27:53.715
Okay.

27:53.757 --> 27:55.425
You're staying in town
for the holidays?

27:55.467 --> 28:00.096
You know, if you're looking
for something to do...

28:00.138 --> 28:02.349
Oh. Okay.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.392
[instrumental music]

28:04.434 --> 28:06.061
Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.

28:12.776 --> 28:17.113
So I guess it's kinda like I am
working on the mural after all.

28:17.155 --> 28:18.198
[chuckles]

28:24.245 --> 28:25.205
[phone buzzes]

28:32.337 --> 28:34.798
[music continues]

28:34.839 --> 28:37.425
Oh, texting with Will.

28:37.467 --> 28:39.135
Mom!

28:39.177 --> 28:40.512
Boundaries!

28:40.553 --> 28:42.806
It was right there. Sorry.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.974
And you're welcome for the
freshly baked cookies

28:45.016 --> 28:47.644
by the way.
I'll go get you some milk.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.979
[Olivia]
Mom, I'm an adult woman.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.981
I don't need a glass of milk.

28:52.023 --> 28:54.025
Oh, don't be silly. You love
milk with your cookies.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.527
I'll be right back.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.447
[sighs]

29:02.367 --> 29:04.577
[music continues]

29:07.372 --> 29:09.124
[phone chimes]

29:16.256 --> 29:19.718
[Olivia] As an artist,
I need you to level with me.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.886
Do either of these ideas work?

29:23.513 --> 29:26.975
I think there are
elements of each that work.

29:27.017 --> 29:28.226
I knew it. They're terrible.

29:28.268 --> 29:30.687
U-un, that's not what I said.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.939
Look, there's good stuff
in here.

29:32.981 --> 29:34.858
I think you just need to...

29:34.899 --> 29:37.902
distill it down into
a unifying theme.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.904
You know?

29:39.946 --> 29:42.907
Okay, uh, what do you
like about this one?

29:45.076 --> 29:48.788
I like the colors
and the composition.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.582
Mm-hmm.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.001
It feels almost dreamlike.

29:53.043 --> 29:57.714
Which is kinda how I remember
Wellington as a kid.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.507
That's great.

29:59.549 --> 30:02.135
And how about this one?

30:02.177 --> 30:04.929
Well, obviously I love it
because it reminds me of Parker.

30:06.931 --> 30:10.685
It feels like that special kind
of Christmas magic.

30:11.686 --> 30:16.566
Warm and cozy and... comforting.

30:16.608 --> 30:18.068
Can't argue with that.

30:18.109 --> 30:20.612
Is it crazy to try to do both?

30:20.653 --> 30:23.448
To come up with a design
that showcases the Winter Walk

30:23.490 --> 30:25.533
but is also more...

30:26.910 --> 30:29.371
personal and-and intimate?

30:29.412 --> 30:30.455
Honestly...

30:31.790 --> 30:33.208
I think that's a great idea.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.045
-Okay.
-Okay.

30:38.421 --> 30:42.842
So all I have to do is
finalize a design,

30:42.884 --> 30:45.345
buy supplies, prep the wall...

30:46.638 --> 30:49.099
overcome my creative block

30:49.140 --> 30:52.894
and flawlessly execute
a public art project

30:52.936 --> 30:55.105
in a week and a half
by Christmas Eve.

30:55.146 --> 30:58.233
[instrumental music]

30:58.274 --> 31:02.737
Okay, but the good news is
you're not alone.

31:02.779 --> 31:06.241
You've got your parents, you've
got Parker, you've got me.

31:07.992 --> 31:10.954
I bet we could rope
Cody and Ivy into it also.

31:10.995 --> 31:12.956
Actually, yeah, I've been
looking for an excuse

31:12.997 --> 31:15.083
to get those two
in a room together.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.794
I set them up on a date
a while ago

31:17.836 --> 31:21.297
and apparently
it did not go well.

31:21.339 --> 31:23.550
Ivy's been holding a grudge
against Cody ever since.

31:23.591 --> 31:26.636
Maybe this could help them
bury the hatchet.

31:26.678 --> 31:28.138
Okay.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.973
I'm making a mental note
to get the details

31:30.015 --> 31:32.809
about that from Ivy ASAP.

31:32.851 --> 31:34.728
[exhales]

31:34.769 --> 31:36.771
Are you sure
that you wanna help?

31:36.813 --> 31:39.858
You're not just... being nice?

31:39.899 --> 31:44.070
Um, well actually
I am being nice

31:44.112 --> 31:46.531
because I'm nice.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.160
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.705
I think I need to just

31:53.747 --> 31:55.665
bite the bullet and get started.

31:55.707 --> 31:56.666
All right.

31:57.876 --> 31:59.210
-Let's get started.
-[chuckles]

31:59.252 --> 32:00.420
Hm.

32:06.843 --> 32:08.845
[Olivia] Hey, perfect timing.

32:08.887 --> 32:10.347
We were just about to
get started.

32:10.388 --> 32:12.182
-You have your lists?
-Oh, yeah.

32:12.223 --> 32:14.601
Olivia, did you see
the sales section?

32:16.561 --> 32:18.772
Well, I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

32:18.813 --> 32:21.232
Hey, Ivy, um, how are you?

32:21.274 --> 32:23.860
I've been fine ever since
you stood me up.

32:23.902 --> 32:25.070
Come on, I didn't stand you up.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.488
I left in the middle
of the date.

32:28.865 --> 32:31.284
Okay, I know that isn't better.

32:31.326 --> 32:33.203
You left me with the bill
at a fancy restaurant

32:33.244 --> 32:35.080
so you could go play bingo.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.248
I venmoed you
and I didn't play bingo.

32:37.290 --> 32:40.585
I hosted bingo at town hall.
Our normal guy flaked.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.212
I couldn't just abandon
the senior group.

32:42.253 --> 32:43.880
No, so you just abandoned me.

32:45.465 --> 32:49.219
I can see that there are
still some fresh wounds here.

32:49.260 --> 32:52.472
How about we split up
tackle our lists separately

32:52.514 --> 32:55.100
and maybe cool off a little bit?

32:55.141 --> 32:56.768
That is a great idea.

32:56.810 --> 32:59.646
So, Ivy, you will come
and grab some paint with me

32:59.688 --> 33:03.983
and, um, Cody and Will, you're
on, uh, tools and equipment.

33:04.025 --> 33:05.026
Let me just remind everyone,

33:05.068 --> 33:06.820
we're dealing with
a limited budget.

33:06.861 --> 33:09.572
Until projects like this gain
traction, the Community

33:09.614 --> 33:11.116
Services Department
has tight purse strings.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.909
That's fine,
I'm sure you'll just

33:12.951 --> 33:14.703
stick us with the bill anyway.

33:14.744 --> 33:17.956
Okay, enough reminiscing.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.125
You couldn't have warned me
I was walking into an ambush?

33:20.166 --> 33:22.460
Oh, no, I could have.

33:22.502 --> 33:23.628
[scoffs]

33:26.548 --> 33:29.718
Wow, if I had known
it was that bad,

33:29.759 --> 33:32.137
I would have had
Will tell Cody to stay home.

33:32.178 --> 33:33.430
I'm fine. I'm over it.

33:33.471 --> 33:35.807
I just wanted to see him squirm.

33:35.849 --> 33:36.891
[laughs]

33:38.393 --> 33:40.103
So...

33:40.145 --> 33:42.814
you and Will are
getting pretty chummy?

33:42.856 --> 33:47.152
Yeah, well, turns out when he's
not being obnoxious,

33:47.193 --> 33:51.031
he's actually kind of nice
and helpful.

33:51.072 --> 33:51.865
Mm-hmm.

33:51.906 --> 33:56.661
Nice and helpful and hot.

33:56.703 --> 33:58.329
Okay, pump the brakes.

33:58.371 --> 34:00.540
My mom already
jumped to that conclusion.

34:00.582 --> 34:04.377
Oh, come on. Stop acting
like it's a crazy thought.

34:04.419 --> 34:06.296
Nothing wrong with
thinking someone's cute.

34:06.338 --> 34:07.881
Cute has nothing to do with it.

34:07.922 --> 34:10.342
We're just collaborating.

34:10.383 --> 34:12.010
You don't have to
look too far into it.

34:12.052 --> 34:14.346
Yeah, we actually have another
session booked for tonight.

34:14.387 --> 34:17.557
See? And you really still think
there's nothing more going on?

34:17.599 --> 34:19.517
Look, until she gives me
reason to believe otherwise,

34:19.559 --> 34:21.728
there's nothing romantic
happening, okay?

34:24.147 --> 34:26.608
[instrumental music]

34:34.616 --> 34:37.243
Olivia, I see you've been busy.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.662
My dad mentioned

34:39.704 --> 34:42.415
that he was going to
stop by and clean today.

34:42.457 --> 34:45.377
Said I needed a proper studio
to work with.

34:45.418 --> 34:48.088
Huh, so despite Cody
abandoning this place,

34:48.129 --> 34:50.090
it's thriving, too.

34:50.131 --> 34:51.966
-Sounds familiar.
-Ha ha.

34:52.008 --> 34:54.344
[Olivia]
Okay, enough lollygagging.

34:54.386 --> 34:56.596
There's still plenty of supplies
to bring in from outside.

34:56.638 --> 34:58.098
Right.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.600
[instrumental music]

35:00.642 --> 35:01.768
Thank you.

35:03.520 --> 35:04.646
[laughs]

35:11.653 --> 35:14.406
[Will] All right, have a look.

35:14.447 --> 35:17.158
You can choose
whatever you'd like, Parker.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.203
Want to paint for an hour?
We can do that.

35:20.245 --> 35:22.247
Want to pound some clay
and make a sculpture?

35:22.288 --> 35:23.623
That's cool, too.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.754
Oh, I think he has
his eye on something.

35:29.796 --> 35:31.548
What do you see?

35:33.133 --> 35:35.051
The pastels.

35:35.093 --> 35:37.554
Excellent choice.
Very expressive.

35:39.139 --> 35:40.890
What should I draw?

35:40.932 --> 35:43.518
Honestly, anything you want.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.687
This is all about you.

35:45.729 --> 35:47.981
[Will]
How you're feeling right now.

35:48.023 --> 35:50.108
I'm just here to guide you

35:50.150 --> 35:51.818
as much
or as little as you need.

35:56.239 --> 35:58.450
Would it be okay if your mom
and I joined you?

35:59.743 --> 36:00.952
Yeah? Nice.

36:10.712 --> 36:13.465
Okay, you've got a pad.
Let's give one to your mom.

36:14.883 --> 36:17.761
And I get one, too.

36:17.802 --> 36:21.306
So... I'll tell you
how I'm feeling.

36:21.348 --> 36:23.808
I'm feeling a bit nostalgic.

36:23.850 --> 36:27.854
I think I'm gonna draw one of
my favorite Christmas memories.

36:27.896 --> 36:30.774
One year, my parents
got me a hockey set

36:30.815 --> 36:33.109
and me and my family
spent all day

36:33.151 --> 36:37.030
shooting goals on
a frozen pond near our house.

36:37.072 --> 36:38.448
That's what I'm gonna draw.

36:42.369 --> 36:44.788
You already know
what you wanna draw?

36:44.829 --> 36:47.791
I wanna draw my favorite
Christmas present, too.

36:47.832 --> 36:50.210
Let me guess,
it was a helicopter.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.337
No.

36:52.379 --> 36:54.506
-I'm drawing my train set.
-What?

36:54.547 --> 36:57.884
You're telling me Santa got
a whole train down the chimney?

36:57.926 --> 36:59.344
It's a toy train.

36:59.386 --> 37:03.390
Santa brought it, but my dad
helped me set it up.

37:06.017 --> 37:08.061
Dad sounds pretty cool.

37:08.103 --> 37:10.939
Yeah. He's in heaven now.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.440
[instrumental music]

37:12.482 --> 37:13.733
I'm sorry, Parker.

37:15.151 --> 37:17.195
I know that's not easy.

37:17.237 --> 37:20.448
Actually, I was only a couple
years older than you are

37:20.490 --> 37:21.991
when my dad went to heaven.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.285
Really?

37:24.327 --> 37:27.497
You know... I miss him a lot.

37:28.623 --> 37:29.916
[Will] He was the best.

37:32.210 --> 37:36.423
But I know he's looking
down on me, even right now.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.551
[softly laughs]

37:39.592 --> 37:41.302
If you want, I can tell you
all about him

37:41.344 --> 37:42.637
while we do our drawing.

37:44.055 --> 37:45.056
Yeah?

37:49.269 --> 37:50.979
[Will] Your stuff?
[Olivia] Yeah.

37:51.021 --> 37:52.147
[Will] Okay.

37:53.148 --> 37:56.776
Whew. I feel that cold wind.

37:56.818 --> 38:00.113
Well, Parker, I think you did
a great job today.

38:00.155 --> 38:02.449
And this turned out so well.

38:02.490 --> 38:04.325
Good job.

38:04.367 --> 38:07.787
Olivia, you have some homework.

38:07.829 --> 38:09.247
[sighs]

38:09.289 --> 38:10.707
Hey, bud.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.044
Can you make sure that your mom
has at least something drawn

38:14.085 --> 38:15.670
before our next session?

38:15.712 --> 38:18.590
-I got you covered.
-Yeah.

38:19.883 --> 38:20.967
That's my guy.

38:25.305 --> 38:27.432
-Our next session?
-Yeah.

38:27.474 --> 38:29.309
I figured if you're both
up for it

38:29.351 --> 38:31.561
before you head back
to the city.

38:32.562 --> 38:34.272
I want to thank you, Will.

38:34.314 --> 38:37.567
I know this means a lot
to Parker and...

38:39.235 --> 38:40.945
it means a lot to me, too.

38:45.492 --> 38:49.037
Mom, can you start the car?
I'm freezing.

38:49.079 --> 38:50.872
Yeah, bud. I'll-I'll
be right there.

38:54.751 --> 38:56.336
-[laughs]
-Well...

38:56.378 --> 38:57.962
-I should probably--
-Yeah.

38:58.922 --> 39:00.382
Um, are you sure

39:00.423 --> 39:02.509
that you're-you're okay
to-to lock up?

39:02.550 --> 39:04.552
Yeah, yeah. I've got to
clean up anyway, so...

39:04.594 --> 39:05.720
-Okay.
-It's all good.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.263
Okay.

39:07.305 --> 39:10.100
-Um, thanks again, Will.
-You got it.

39:12.352 --> 39:13.520
[car door shuts]

39:17.023 --> 39:19.526
[mellow music]

39:47.095 --> 39:49.305
[music continues]

40:02.569 --> 40:04.696
[Betty]
It's absolutely beautiful.

40:05.655 --> 40:07.574
Parker's first Christmas.

40:07.615 --> 40:10.076
He was the best gift anyone
could have asked for.

40:11.286 --> 40:13.621
I don't know what happened.

40:13.663 --> 40:15.540
I was thinking about Parker,

40:15.582 --> 40:18.209
and how easily
he started his drawing.

40:18.251 --> 40:20.003
Something just clicked.

40:20.045 --> 40:23.381
My hand started
moving on its own.

40:23.423 --> 40:26.384
Well, it must have been tough,
putting this down on paper.

40:26.426 --> 40:28.678
I'm proud of you.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.639
At any rate, it should
help with the mural, right?

40:31.681 --> 40:34.601
Have the creative floodgates
been opened?

40:36.186 --> 40:39.606
Drawing this was one thing.

40:39.647 --> 40:42.817
Painting a huge mural
for everyone to see?

40:42.859 --> 40:44.611
That's a whole
different animal.

40:46.196 --> 40:47.405
But I'm ready to try.

40:47.447 --> 40:49.282
Ah, good.

40:54.412 --> 40:56.706
What do you mean by a moment?

40:56.748 --> 41:01.461
We were standing out front,
saying goodnight, and...

41:01.503 --> 41:04.381
I don't know. It felt like
something could have happened.

41:04.422 --> 41:06.383
And?

41:06.424 --> 41:08.927
-Did it?
-No, of course not.

41:08.968 --> 41:10.845
Don't say it
like its ridiculous.

41:10.887 --> 41:13.223
You're both young,
single, attractive...

41:13.264 --> 41:15.141
Aww, thanks, man.

41:15.183 --> 41:17.435
[laughs] I'm just saying,
what's the holdup?

41:17.477 --> 41:19.688
[Will] Don't get me wrong, okay?

41:19.729 --> 41:21.773
I wanted to kiss her.

41:21.815 --> 41:24.192
But, you know,
Parker was there...

41:27.696 --> 41:29.698
And I guess I feel like

41:29.739 --> 41:32.742
it's not my place to
make a move like that.

41:32.784 --> 41:35.412
Olivia needs to decide
when it's right.

41:35.453 --> 41:36.955
For her, and for Parker.

41:37.789 --> 41:39.332
Sure, I get that.

41:39.374 --> 41:40.834
But don't you think last night
might have been

41:40.875 --> 41:43.378
some kind of indication
she's into you?

41:43.420 --> 41:44.921
It was basically a date.

41:44.963 --> 41:47.465
Me doing art therapy
with her son? That was a date?

41:47.507 --> 41:48.842
Wouldn't even
breach the top five

41:48.883 --> 41:50.510
of the weirdest first dates
I've been on.

41:50.552 --> 41:53.179
[both laugh]

41:53.221 --> 41:54.973
I don't know.

41:58.309 --> 42:00.603
You really think she might have
considered last night a date?

42:00.645 --> 42:02.689
If I were her,
I'd date you before

42:02.731 --> 42:03.732
letting you give
my kid therapy.

42:03.773 --> 42:05.358
-Hey.
-Whoa.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.359
[thuds]

42:06.401 --> 42:08.611
Uh...

42:08.653 --> 42:10.071
Was that a wreath?

42:10.113 --> 42:12.866
Yes, but I was aiming at Cody.

42:12.907 --> 42:15.452
Oh, well, now I see why
you became an artist.

42:15.493 --> 42:17.746
[Cody and Olivia laugh]

42:17.787 --> 42:21.958
Wow, what happened in here?
It looks great.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.586
Well, I figured we're gonna be
spending a lot of time here.

42:24.627 --> 42:25.920
Might as well make it festive.

42:25.962 --> 42:27.881
How'd he rope you into this?

42:27.922 --> 42:28.923
I honestly don't know.

42:28.965 --> 42:30.300
[Olivia chuckles]

42:30.342 --> 42:31.426
I should be at town hall.

42:31.468 --> 42:32.719
And now that you're here,

42:32.761 --> 42:35.347
I feel less guilty
about leaving.

42:35.388 --> 42:38.099
Ornaments exchange tonight,
you guys.

42:38.141 --> 42:40.977
And I noticed that wall
is still alarmingly blank.

42:41.019 --> 42:44.147
Don't worry, that is
going to change very soon.

42:44.189 --> 42:45.815
Good luck.

42:45.857 --> 42:47.442
Thanks, man. See you later.

42:49.277 --> 42:50.487
[door closes]

42:50.528 --> 42:52.113
[holiday music playing]

42:52.155 --> 42:54.741
So are we actually
gonna go paint,

42:54.783 --> 42:56.910
or were you just
trying to get rid of Cody?

42:56.951 --> 42:58.411
A little bit of both.

42:58.453 --> 43:00.914
I figured we could start

43:00.955 --> 43:03.416
by finishing up
the actual mural frame.

43:03.458 --> 43:06.795
And I'll tell you all about my
new design idea.

43:06.836 --> 43:08.630
New design idea?

43:08.672 --> 43:10.131
Now you're talking.

43:10.173 --> 43:10.924
[softly laughs]

43:10.965 --> 43:12.300
Well, lead the way.

43:15.261 --> 43:17.138
[drill whirring]

43:17.180 --> 43:20.934
So yeah, most of the design
would be more traditional,

43:20.975 --> 43:22.811
kind of like
the Norman Rockwell idea,

43:22.852 --> 43:25.188
but with some
different styles thrown in.

43:25.230 --> 43:27.399
So the trees and the mountains

43:27.440 --> 43:30.694
could be more
classical landscape style.

43:30.735 --> 43:32.946
And then throw in some lights

43:32.987 --> 43:35.281
and Christmas decorations
for the holidays.

43:35.323 --> 43:38.451
Maybe some surrealism.
Couple of nutcrackers melting.

43:38.493 --> 43:39.828
[laughs]

43:43.331 --> 43:44.541
[drill whirring]

43:46.209 --> 43:48.503
Seriously, I think
that sounds great.

43:48.545 --> 43:50.171
It's ambitious, but it's great.

43:50.213 --> 43:51.381
[laughs]

43:51.423 --> 43:53.466
[soft music]

43:54.718 --> 43:57.303
I wanted to thank you again,
Will,

43:57.345 --> 43:58.596
for last night.

43:59.597 --> 44:01.975
It was really wonderful.

44:02.017 --> 44:04.894
And not just
because I'm feeling inspired.

44:04.936 --> 44:07.814
Parker is so proud
of his drawing.

44:07.856 --> 44:10.442
He would not stop talking
about you at breakfast.

44:10.483 --> 44:12.819
[Will chuckles]
Well, I'm glad I could help.

44:12.861 --> 44:14.487
Oh, that reminds me.

44:16.406 --> 44:18.199
My homework, as requested.

44:18.241 --> 44:20.368
Oh. Okay.

44:22.829 --> 44:24.706
[Will] Oh, wow.

44:24.748 --> 44:26.291
[laughs]

44:26.332 --> 44:29.127
-Is that...?
-It's Tom with Parker.

44:30.712 --> 44:32.130
It's my favorite
Christmas memory.

44:32.172 --> 44:34.424
[Will inhales]
It's beautiful.

44:34.466 --> 44:37.010
[music continues]

44:37.052 --> 44:39.888
Like I said, if, um, if Parker

44:39.929 --> 44:41.681
wants to do
another session with me

44:41.723 --> 44:44.017
while you're still here,
I'd be happy to.

44:44.059 --> 44:46.561
I've still got all
the supplies in there.

44:46.603 --> 44:47.896
Thank you.

44:50.523 --> 44:53.735
You really love this, don't you?

44:53.777 --> 44:55.945
Art therapy, teaching...

44:55.987 --> 44:59.032
I couldn't imagine doing
anything else.

44:59.074 --> 45:01.201
I mean, no offense, but if it
weren't for the severe lack

45:01.242 --> 45:03.161
of teaching opportunities
in Boston,

45:03.203 --> 45:05.705
I probably wouldn't
have ended up in Wellington.

45:05.747 --> 45:07.165
[Olivia laughs]

45:07.207 --> 45:09.334
But turned out for the best.

45:09.376 --> 45:12.045
[holiday music]

45:13.338 --> 45:14.881
[Olivia]
I think it looks pretty good.

45:14.923 --> 45:18.468
Yeah, now all you've got
to do is paint.

45:18.510 --> 45:20.929
[indistinct chatter]

45:21.971 --> 45:24.641
[Olivia]
Well, this place is packed!

45:24.683 --> 45:28.228
When you said ornament exchange,
I was picturing like ten people.

45:28.269 --> 45:30.689
Well, that's 'cause
Cody's been killing it lately.

45:30.730 --> 45:32.357
You know, it's only the second
year that we've done this

45:32.399 --> 45:34.943
and it's already
a Wellington staple.

45:34.984 --> 45:37.362
Hey, Parker...

45:37.404 --> 45:39.572
Are you sure
you wanna hang that one?

45:41.157 --> 45:43.493
You worked so hard on it.

45:43.535 --> 45:44.828
Yeah, I'm sure.

45:44.869 --> 45:46.329
I think it's cool someone else

45:46.371 --> 45:48.415
is gonna get to put it
on their own tree.

45:48.456 --> 45:49.332
[laughs]

45:50.542 --> 45:51.960
Can you help me hang it?

45:52.002 --> 45:54.087
I need someone tall to lift me.

45:54.129 --> 45:57.173
What? You think I'm tall?
That's amazing.

45:57.215 --> 45:58.425
-[Olivia chuckles]
-Sure.

45:58.466 --> 46:00.093
-Can I?
-Yeah.

46:00.135 --> 46:01.720
All right.
Let's go pick the best spot.

46:01.761 --> 46:03.930
-Just be careful, please.
-Mm-hmm.

46:03.972 --> 46:05.390
Mm-hmm. Whoa.

46:05.432 --> 46:07.100
Okay. Okay.

46:07.142 --> 46:10.270
Parker seems to be
really taking to Will.

46:10.311 --> 46:13.523
I mean, it probably helps
that Will is basically

46:13.565 --> 46:14.733
a big kid himself.

46:14.774 --> 46:15.692
-[chuckling] yeah.
-But...

46:15.734 --> 46:18.278
Yeah, I know what you mean.

46:18.319 --> 46:20.030
[Olivia] It's like Parker's
starting to come out...

46:20.071 --> 46:22.157
-...of his shell a little bit.
-Mm-hmm.

46:22.198 --> 46:23.283
And boy, is he ever

46:23.324 --> 46:26.286
responding to Will's art
therapy.

46:26.327 --> 46:29.539
You two are joined
at the hip lately.

46:29.581 --> 46:31.082
Yeah, well,

46:31.124 --> 46:33.084
as much as I hate to admit it,

46:33.126 --> 46:36.421
Will has been
a huge help so far.

46:36.463 --> 46:39.591
I don't think I'd be able
to finish in time on my own.

46:39.632 --> 46:42.594
I'm not talking about
the painting, Olivia.

46:42.635 --> 46:44.554
I'm talking about this.

46:44.596 --> 46:46.973
Wait, h-hold up.
One, two, three, jump!

46:47.015 --> 46:48.892
[instrumental music]

46:48.933 --> 46:51.061
-[Olivia] Cookies.
-Cookies!

46:51.102 --> 46:52.645
-Just one.
-[Parker] Yeah.

46:52.687 --> 46:56.066
Just a single... Thank you.
Just a single one.

46:56.107 --> 46:57.400
[Olivia] Of course, you can.

47:04.407 --> 47:05.825
[soft music]

47:05.867 --> 47:06.785
[sighs]

47:27.222 --> 47:29.224
-[shattering]
-[Will] Yes!

47:29.265 --> 47:31.851
[Will] Now that is what
I'm talking about.

47:31.893 --> 47:33.895
[Will laughs]

47:33.937 --> 47:36.231
I'm telling you, buddy,
it feels great.

47:36.272 --> 47:38.566
You're not gonna get
in trouble. I promise.

47:38.608 --> 47:41.236
[quirky music]

47:42.946 --> 47:43.905
[Parker inhales]

47:43.947 --> 47:44.781
[shatters]

47:44.823 --> 47:47.575
[Will laughs] Ho-oh, see?

47:47.617 --> 47:49.536
Good, right?

47:49.577 --> 47:52.414
Go crazy.
Yeah, there's a whole stack.

47:52.455 --> 47:54.708
What is going on in here?

47:54.749 --> 47:57.002
-[shatters]
- Oh. That?

47:57.043 --> 47:59.671
That's therapy. Mm-hmm.

47:59.713 --> 48:01.423
[Olivia chuckles]

48:01.464 --> 48:02.465
[shatters]

48:02.507 --> 48:04.092
[Olivia laughs]

48:04.134 --> 48:08.805
Umm, since you're already here,
do you want to?

48:12.642 --> 48:13.643
[Will laughs]

48:13.685 --> 48:15.854
[breathes deeply]

48:16.855 --> 48:17.981
[plate shatters]

48:18.023 --> 48:19.858
[Will laughs] Oh, yeah.

48:19.899 --> 48:21.067
Doesn't that feel great?

48:21.109 --> 48:23.820
[Olivia laughs]
Okay, yes, I will admit

48:23.862 --> 48:26.614
that feels pretty amazing.

48:26.656 --> 48:28.575
Kind of like a weight
has been lifted.

48:28.616 --> 48:30.285
Fantastic.

48:30.326 --> 48:32.162
Parker, you did so well

48:32.203 --> 48:34.414
at this first part
of the process.

48:34.456 --> 48:36.374
Now what we get
to do is choose

48:36.416 --> 48:40.337
the pieces that you wanna
use in your mosaic.

48:40.378 --> 48:41.880
* I can hear the bells *

48:41.921 --> 48:43.923
* The bells are ringing

48:43.965 --> 48:47.385
* I can hear the children
playing, singing *

48:47.427 --> 48:51.139
* I've been going back
to that old feeling *

48:51.181 --> 48:55.018
* Time to turn it back
to that old feeling *

48:55.060 --> 48:58.855
* Take me home take me home

48:58.897 --> 49:02.150
* To Christmas

49:02.192 --> 49:06.321
* I'll be home I'll be home *

49:06.363 --> 49:08.281
* For Christmas

49:08.323 --> 49:10.950
* Ohh-ohh

49:10.992 --> 49:14.162
* New memories waiting for me

49:14.204 --> 49:16.664
* There's no place
where I'd rather be *

49:16.706 --> 49:18.249
* Ohh-ohh

49:18.291 --> 49:21.378
* Home, take me home *

49:21.419 --> 49:25.715
* To Christmas, to Christmas *

49:26.883 --> 49:29.344
[female singer vocalizing]

49:47.737 --> 49:48.697
[keys clanking]

49:51.282 --> 49:52.659
[door lock clicks]

49:52.701 --> 49:53.743
[switch clicks]

49:55.245 --> 49:56.579
[Will] Hello. Anyone home?

49:58.373 --> 50:00.709
-Hey.
-Hi.

50:00.750 --> 50:03.586
I'm glad I didn't miss you.
Um, I come bearing gifts.

50:05.088 --> 50:06.381
Is that takeout?

50:06.589 --> 50:08.883
There's a great Thai place
just around the corner.

50:08.925 --> 50:10.885
I-I felt bad that I couldn't
help out earlier,

50:10.927 --> 50:12.721
so I came to bribe you.

50:12.762 --> 50:14.305
[Olivia laughs]

50:14.347 --> 50:15.807
Hope you like pad see ew.

50:15.849 --> 50:17.559
There's enough for two.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.811
[soft music]

50:19.853 --> 50:20.895
That sounds perfect.

50:20.937 --> 50:22.856
[Olivia] Four brothers?

50:24.107 --> 50:27.444
I cannot imagine five kids.

50:27.485 --> 50:29.612
Yeah, I don't think my parents
could either.

50:29.654 --> 50:31.656
I am the youngest
by nine years.

50:31.698 --> 50:34.075
Aw, you're a little
accident baby.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.744
Well, you know,
I prefer "surprise."

50:35.785 --> 50:37.704
[Olivia laughs]

50:37.746 --> 50:41.249
So what's your brothers' deal?
They all married with kids?

50:41.291 --> 50:42.959
Oh, yeah.

50:43.001 --> 50:45.253
I have ten nieces and nephews.

50:45.295 --> 50:48.506
Wow! Christmas
at your mom's must be wild.

50:48.548 --> 50:50.383
[Will] Yeah, it is, of course.

50:50.425 --> 50:52.510
Still doesn't stop my mom
from asking

50:52.552 --> 50:55.096
when I will be giving her
more grandchildren.

50:55.138 --> 50:56.639
[indistinct song playing]

50:56.681 --> 50:58.433
But, uh, I just

50:58.475 --> 51:01.436
don't think
I'm really cut out for that.

51:02.937 --> 51:06.649
For... being a parent?

51:06.691 --> 51:09.444
Will, come on,
I've seen you teach.

51:09.486 --> 51:12.322
And with Parker,
obviously you'd be great at it.

51:13.990 --> 51:18.620
Sorry, um... you did not ask
my opinion on that.

51:18.661 --> 51:19.704
You're okay.

51:24.459 --> 51:25.919
I know that it's stupid, but...

51:29.422 --> 51:32.717
When my dad died,
it hit me so hard as a kid.

51:32.759 --> 51:37.347
I was sad and angry
and confused

51:37.389 --> 51:40.225
and I think,
I think one day I'll be gone.

51:40.266 --> 51:43.311
And when that happens,
I don't want

51:43.353 --> 51:46.064
my kid to have to live
through what I did.

51:46.106 --> 51:48.566
[instrumental music]

51:49.693 --> 51:50.610
Will...

51:52.946 --> 51:55.490
That is not stupid.

51:55.532 --> 51:59.035
Losing someone you love
is... really hard.

52:01.913 --> 52:04.249
But you can't let the fear
of losing someone

52:04.290 --> 52:06.626
outweigh the joy
of loving them.

52:09.879 --> 52:14.509
There's not a day that goes by
that I don't... miss Tom.

52:16.386 --> 52:18.138
But that...

52:18.179 --> 52:20.056
pain and that grief...

52:21.391 --> 52:23.685
it's worth it.

52:23.727 --> 52:26.855
Because of all of the wonderful
memories that I have of him.

52:28.398 --> 52:31.067
And yeah, I wish that...

52:31.109 --> 52:34.404
I could spare Parker the pain
of having lost his dad.

52:36.614 --> 52:39.409
But that would mean
losing the good parts too.

52:39.451 --> 52:41.619
[music continues]

52:43.747 --> 52:46.499
And I know he wouldn't trade
those memories for anything.

52:54.257 --> 52:56.551
Sounds like it was
kind of awkward.

52:56.593 --> 53:00.513
It was, at first,
but then we started painting

53:00.555 --> 53:02.432
and everything
went back to normal.

53:02.474 --> 53:04.225
Well, you guys did kind of bare

53:04.267 --> 53:06.061
your souls to each other
last night.

53:06.102 --> 53:08.104
That's a heavy conversation
to come back from.

53:08.146 --> 53:10.857
Especially when it's with
someone he likes so much.

53:10.899 --> 53:14.778
Okay, you have to stop saying
that he likesme.

53:14.819 --> 53:17.405
I refuse.
I will die on this hill.

53:17.447 --> 53:20.408
[both laughing]

53:20.450 --> 53:23.453
I guess I did see
another side of him last night.

53:23.495 --> 53:26.539
It was nice having
a real conversation.

53:26.581 --> 53:27.957
He must make you
feel comfortable.

53:28.958 --> 53:31.127
Yeah, he does.

53:31.169 --> 53:32.837
[Ivy] I think it's great.

53:34.047 --> 53:35.298
And you should too.

53:35.340 --> 53:37.842
[instrumental music]

53:40.470 --> 53:41.680
How's it going over there?

53:43.515 --> 53:46.184
[Olivia laughs]
That's great. Is that us?

53:46.226 --> 53:48.728
Yeah. I think I need
to make your head bigger.

53:49.979 --> 53:51.106
Excuse me.

53:54.984 --> 53:56.486
[Olivia laughs]

53:59.155 --> 54:01.282
-[laughs]
-[Parker] Mouth.

54:01.324 --> 54:04.619
Ear. Ear. Eyes.

54:04.661 --> 54:06.496
-[both laughing]
-That's better.

54:06.538 --> 54:08.581
[both laughing]

54:08.623 --> 54:10.875
[laughingly]
Excuse me.

54:12.544 --> 54:13.628
[chuckles]

54:13.670 --> 54:15.171
[breathes deeply]

54:17.173 --> 54:19.134
Hey, bud. I wanted
to talk to you about something.

54:21.886 --> 54:27.517
So I know...Christmas here
so far has been a lot of fun...

54:29.728 --> 54:31.604
Yeah, I like getting to see

54:31.646 --> 54:34.482
Grandma and Grandpa
all the time.

54:34.524 --> 54:37.277
I like Mr. Campbell, too.
He's funny.

54:37.318 --> 54:40.655
Yeah, he's kind of a goofball,
huh?

54:40.697 --> 54:44.993
Yeah, he helped me make friends
at the Christmas Craft Club.

54:45.035 --> 54:46.828
That's great.

54:46.870 --> 54:48.038
I'm so glad.

54:51.708 --> 54:55.337
I guess... we're really
gonna miss all this

54:55.378 --> 54:56.838
when we head home
after Christmas.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.548
Yeah.

55:00.091 --> 55:01.760
But the good news

55:01.801 --> 55:05.930
is that Wellington is not that
far from New York.

55:05.972 --> 55:08.683
So we don't have to wait
until Christmas to visit again.

55:08.725 --> 55:11.227
-When can we come back?
-Whenever you want.

55:11.269 --> 55:13.313
I mean within reason.

55:13.355 --> 55:15.774
-It is a five hour drive.
-Okay.

55:15.815 --> 55:17.359
[instrumental music]

55:17.400 --> 55:18.318
[Parker sighs]

55:24.866 --> 55:25.950
It's dad.

55:34.793 --> 55:36.711
He will always be with us.

55:37.420 --> 55:39.214
No matter what.

55:39.255 --> 55:40.965
You know that, right?

55:50.558 --> 55:51.851
-Hey, mom.
-Hey!

55:51.893 --> 55:53.603
[Betty clears throat]

55:53.645 --> 55:56.106
-What's going on?
-Oh, not much.

55:56.147 --> 55:57.941
Should be ready soon.

55:57.982 --> 56:00.527
This all looks great,
but I thought

56:00.568 --> 56:02.904
you said we were having
a quick family dinner.

56:02.946 --> 56:04.906
I-I have to keep working
on the mural after this.

56:04.948 --> 56:08.493
Oh, I know that, sweetheart.
We won't keep you too long.

56:08.535 --> 56:10.954
Yeah. Anyway, I just felt
like making something special.

56:10.995 --> 56:12.622
[door opens]

56:12.664 --> 56:14.666
[Mack] Hey, Park,
look who's here.

56:14.708 --> 56:16.543
-[main door closes]
-[Parker] Mr. Campbell!

56:16.584 --> 56:18.128
[Mack and Will laughing]

56:18.169 --> 56:19.629
Hey, Parker.

56:19.671 --> 56:21.631
-Nice to see you.
-[Mack] Have a seat, Will.

56:21.673 --> 56:23.508
-Oh, thanks.
-[Mack] We are...

56:23.550 --> 56:24.676
Mom.

56:24.718 --> 56:26.511
[pleasant music playing]

56:26.553 --> 56:30.807
Did you invite Will to dinner
and forget to tell me about it?

56:30.849 --> 56:33.560
No, I didn't forget.
I told you this morning.

56:33.601 --> 56:35.854
No, you didn't.

56:35.895 --> 56:37.105
Well, I meant to.

56:37.147 --> 56:39.816
[scoffs]
Must have just slipped my mind.

56:39.858 --> 56:42.193
Well, anyway, I don't know
what all the fuss is.

56:42.235 --> 56:46.156
He's a very nice man. He's been
helping you with your mural.

56:46.197 --> 56:47.991
I... Actually...

56:48.033 --> 56:50.785
it's appalling
that we didn't do this sooner.

56:52.495 --> 56:54.706
Well, if you had
talked to me about it,

56:54.748 --> 56:56.958
I might have mentioned
that tonight

56:57.000 --> 56:59.085
isn't really the best night.

57:00.295 --> 57:02.047
-Why not?
-Because!

57:06.384 --> 57:09.512
We had kind of an intense
conversation yesterday

57:09.554 --> 57:11.973
and now having him over,
I just...

57:13.516 --> 57:15.685
I don't want him
to get the wrong idea.

57:15.727 --> 57:18.855
What wrong idea?
It's a pot roast.

57:18.897 --> 57:21.024
You're doing that thing

57:21.066 --> 57:25.445
where you act all innocent,
but secretly you are plotting.

57:25.487 --> 57:26.863
[food sizzling on stove]

57:26.905 --> 57:30.658
And you are looking
too far into this.

57:30.700 --> 57:33.870
Now, I want you to march over
to that stove

57:33.912 --> 57:36.456
and make sure those veggies
don't burn

57:36.498 --> 57:39.250
while I go greet our guest.

57:41.086 --> 57:42.671
[sighs]

57:42.712 --> 57:45.090
[Betty] Will, I'm so glad
you could make it.

57:45.131 --> 57:47.634
[Will] Thank you.
Good to see you.

57:47.676 --> 57:49.803
[Olivia] You did
that self-portrait.

57:49.844 --> 57:51.221
It looked exactly like you.

57:51.262 --> 57:53.348
[Mack] It didn't look
anything like me.

57:53.390 --> 57:55.392
[Will] Seriously though,
the mural is looking great.

57:55.433 --> 57:57.894
I could see why Olivia's been
able to make it

57:57.936 --> 58:01.856
as an artist in New York City.
That's not easy.

58:01.898 --> 58:03.316
[Mack] That must feel good
having another artist

58:03.358 --> 58:04.984
talk about your work
with such high esteem.

58:05.026 --> 58:07.862
[Olivia chuckles]
Well, it may be infrequent,

58:07.904 --> 58:10.532
but yes, it is appreciated.

58:10.573 --> 58:13.076
I try telling her all the time

58:13.118 --> 58:15.120
how great she is and she
doesn't like hearing it.

58:15.161 --> 58:16.663
Her own mother.

58:16.705 --> 58:18.748
Now granted,
I'm not an art critic,

58:18.790 --> 58:21.084
but I do know good art
when I see it.

58:21.126 --> 58:23.503
[Will] I mean, I-I get that.

58:23.545 --> 58:25.922
My mom's a bit like that
and, um...

58:25.964 --> 58:27.465
I admit it can be
a bit embarrassing.

58:27.507 --> 58:28.925
-[chuckles]
-Okay.

58:28.967 --> 58:31.302
[Will] It's not that we
don't believe you,

58:31.344 --> 58:32.303
it's just...

58:33.680 --> 58:36.766
Artists are pretty hard
on themselves.

58:36.808 --> 58:38.435
And when you have a good mother,
you know that

58:38.476 --> 58:41.771
she is going to support you
no matter what, right?

58:41.813 --> 58:45.233
I could draw
a stick figure dog

58:45.275 --> 58:47.777
with five legs and my mother
would think it was wonderful.

58:47.819 --> 58:49.779
[all laughing]

58:49.821 --> 58:52.949
So, Betty, I would just
take it as a compliment.

58:52.991 --> 58:54.200
It means Olivia knows
that you love her

58:54.242 --> 58:55.952
and you want
what's best for her.

58:55.994 --> 58:59.581
Mr. Campbell, do you
ever visit New York?

59:00.707 --> 59:02.250
Um...

59:02.292 --> 59:05.754
You know, not as much
as I would like to.

59:05.795 --> 59:07.797
But now that I have
some friends there,

59:07.839 --> 59:09.466
maybe I should come
more often.

59:09.507 --> 59:11.509
[instrumental music]

59:11.551 --> 59:13.178
If that's okay, of course.

59:15.972 --> 59:18.600
Yeah. You are welcome anytime.

59:22.479 --> 59:25.148
You'd eat a bag of sugar
if we allowed you.

59:25.190 --> 59:26.024
[laughter]

59:26.066 --> 59:27.317
Just like this guy.

59:27.359 --> 59:28.902
[fire crackling]

59:28.943 --> 59:30.862
I hate to cut
a lovely evening short,

59:30.904 --> 59:34.115
but I think Parker
is all S'mored out.

59:34.157 --> 59:35.909
-Oh.
-So I better get him to bed.

59:35.950 --> 59:37.327
Oh, don't be silly,

59:37.369 --> 59:39.120
your father and I'll
put him to bed.

59:39.162 --> 59:42.040
[Betty] You can stay and have
fun. Come on, sweetheart.

59:42.082 --> 59:43.416
Sweetie, I-I haven't finished
roasting that m--

59:43.458 --> 59:46.086
Come on, sweetheart.

59:46.127 --> 59:49.214
Uh, yeah, I probably
should lay off the sugar.

59:49.255 --> 59:50.340
[sighs]

59:51.633 --> 59:54.386
Will, great to have you over.

59:54.427 --> 59:55.261
Thank you so much.

59:55.303 --> 59:57.597
-All right, load me up.
-Okay.

59:57.639 --> 01:00:00.016
-Oh, it's okay, buddy.
-I got you, little buddy.

01:00:00.058 --> 01:00:01.101
Okay. You okay, dad?

01:00:01.142 --> 01:00:02.769
-Yeah. Here we go.
-Okay.

01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:04.354
Goodnight, guys.

01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:06.439
Yeah. Goodnight.

01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:07.857
[Betty] Goodnight.

01:00:07.899 --> 01:00:10.360
-Goodnight, mom.
-Goodnight, sweetheart.

01:00:10.402 --> 01:00:12.904
[soft music]

01:00:18.034 --> 01:00:20.370
[Olivia] New York does not
have stars like this.

01:00:20.412 --> 01:00:23.164
[Will] Well, score one
for Wellington.

01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:26.668
I mean sure, we might not have
the city's culture

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:30.880
or food or incredible art scene

01:00:30.922 --> 01:00:32.882
or bountiful career
opportunities,

01:00:32.924 --> 01:00:35.218
but we got stars.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.428
[chuckles]

01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:39.681
[sighs]

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.683
Speaking of
career opportunities...

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:44.894
I've been so busy
with the mural

01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:47.063
that I haven't even thought
about work.

01:00:48.356 --> 01:00:49.566
What's up?

01:00:49.607 --> 01:00:52.068
I, uh...

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.696
Found out my job
is having to downsize

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:58.700
and... I'm not sure where
I land on the chopping block.

01:01:00.577 --> 01:01:02.287
Really? That's awful.

01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:09.210
So... if your job
is up in the air,

01:01:09.252 --> 01:01:11.296
is there any reason that you're

01:01:11.338 --> 01:01:13.715
rushing back
right after Christmas?

01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:15.925
I mean, I don't know what people
get up to in New York City,

01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:18.970
but I will tell you that things
are pretty wild

01:01:19.012 --> 01:01:21.931
here on New Year's Eve.

01:01:21.973 --> 01:01:24.351
Some of the stores
even stay open till 9:00.

01:01:24.392 --> 01:01:26.186
[laughing]

01:01:26.227 --> 01:01:27.395
Yeah.

01:01:27.437 --> 01:01:29.105
[music continues]

01:01:29.147 --> 01:01:31.983
Well, for all I know,
my job could be safe.

01:01:33.985 --> 01:01:37.238
Plus... I have
to head home sometime.

01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:39.991
Get back to real life.

01:01:41.534 --> 01:01:45.205
Sure. There's probably nothing
here worth sticking around for.

01:01:45.246 --> 01:01:47.624
[fire continues crackling]

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:01.513
Wait.

01:02:03.056 --> 01:02:05.809
I'm sorry. I-I-I can't.
I can't do this.

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.144
-Uh, Olivia, I--
-Please, um...

01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:11.022
I need to go.

01:02:14.526 --> 01:02:16.277
[door glides]

01:02:17.987 --> 01:02:19.364
[door glides shut]

01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:21.866
[sighs]

01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:24.411
[instrumental music]

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:27.414
[sighs]

01:02:48.518 --> 01:02:49.811
[car honks]

01:02:55.358 --> 01:02:56.443
[sighs]

01:03:01.614 --> 01:03:04.075
[tapping on phone]

01:03:04.909 --> 01:03:06.077
[phone chimes]

01:03:13.585 --> 01:03:15.086
[door glides and slams]

01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:16.713
[door closes]

01:03:16.755 --> 01:03:17.672
Will?

01:03:21.259 --> 01:03:22.552
Hey.

01:03:22.594 --> 01:03:24.220
Oh, hey, Dad.

01:03:24.262 --> 01:03:26.056
[chuckling]
Well, nice to see you too.

01:03:26.097 --> 01:03:28.933
Sorry, I-I thought
you were Will.

01:03:28.975 --> 01:03:32.312
We had a weird thing
last night,

01:03:32.354 --> 01:03:34.939
and we haven't had a chance
to talk about it yet.

01:03:34.981 --> 01:03:36.566
Oh.

01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:38.443
Well, look,
if you need an ear to bend,

01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:39.486
I'm right here.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.321
Thanks.

01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:44.157
What have you got there?

01:03:44.199 --> 01:03:46.743
Oh, uh, just some tools
and hardware.

01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:49.120
You know, I thought
I'd reinforce those shelves.

01:03:49.162 --> 01:03:50.747
You know, make sure
they don't collapse on us.

01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:53.875
Dad, you are working so hard.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.251
You should give yourself
the day off.

01:03:55.293 --> 01:03:58.421
You just retired.
You should relax and enjoy it.

01:03:58.463 --> 01:04:02.258
Sweetie, I-I tried relaxing.
It didn't really take.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.345
But I-I am enjoying it.
I get to hang out with you.

01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:07.639
Now come on, let-let me pick up
some of Will's slack

01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:08.723
and give you a hand.

01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:11.184
Thanks. That would be nice.

01:04:11.226 --> 01:04:14.270
[instrumental music]

01:04:14.312 --> 01:04:17.399
[Will] All right, folks,
do not forget the nose.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.276
Remember, if it ain't red,
it ain't Rudolph, right?

01:04:20.318 --> 01:04:22.696
It's just some boring, average,
nameless reindeer.

01:04:22.737 --> 01:04:24.447
[students laughing]

01:04:24.489 --> 01:04:27.742
Okay, so you got shut down.
What happened next?

01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:29.160
Nothing. I went home.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.124
-Great, Doug.
-Thanks, Will.

01:04:34.165 --> 01:04:35.291
Love your imagination.

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:37.919
Oh, purple's cool, too.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.379
Way to go against
the grain, Mona.

01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:41.506
Born rebel over here.

01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:44.926
Very nice,
Very nice, everybody.

01:04:44.968 --> 01:04:47.971
Have you guys,
like...talked about it?

01:04:48.013 --> 01:04:50.056
Not a peep.

01:04:50.098 --> 01:04:52.142
I'm not an idiot, Cody.
I could take a hint.

01:04:52.183 --> 01:04:53.435
She needs space.

01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:55.311
Or she was just
caught off guard.

01:04:55.353 --> 01:04:57.313
Probably felt like one of these
in the headlights.

01:04:58.565 --> 01:05:00.650
[scoffs]

01:05:00.692 --> 01:05:04.029
Well, suffice it to say I am not
gonna make that mistake again.

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:06.197
I'm just gonna keep
my distance.

01:05:06.239 --> 01:05:08.658
[music continues]

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.327
It was a dumb move anyway.
She's leaving in a couple days.

01:05:14.831 --> 01:05:16.207
All right, looks like everybody

01:05:16.249 --> 01:05:18.918
is putting the finishing
touches on their work.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.337
Oh, and that's a good thing

01:05:20.378 --> 01:05:22.172
because we've
just run out of time.

01:05:22.213 --> 01:05:24.174
Thanks for a fun class,
everyone.

01:05:24.215 --> 01:05:25.342
You've done
some great work today.

01:05:25.383 --> 01:05:26.426
Let's all give a hand to Will

01:05:26.468 --> 01:05:28.053
for so graciously hosting

01:05:28.094 --> 01:05:29.679
class on such short notice.

01:05:29.721 --> 01:05:32.098
-[all clapping]
-[students] Thank you.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.725
Thank you. Thanks.

01:05:33.767 --> 01:05:35.435
Great stuff. Nice.

01:05:35.477 --> 01:05:37.020
[students chattering]

01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:39.022
Seriously, man. Thank you.

01:05:39.064 --> 01:05:41.941
I'm gonna kill Randy for
bailing on bingo day again.

01:05:41.983 --> 01:05:43.526
Honestly, I enjoy it.

01:05:43.568 --> 01:05:46.404
You find yourself short staffed
again, you let me know.

01:05:46.446 --> 01:05:49.324
Well, if the mural goes well,
maybe I could convince the city

01:05:49.366 --> 01:05:51.618
to allocate more funds
for our projects.

01:05:51.659 --> 01:05:52.911
Get you paid
for stuff like this.

01:05:52.952 --> 01:05:54.954
I wouldn't say no to that.

01:05:54.996 --> 01:05:56.998
So long as Olivia finishes
in time.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.124
You think she's gonna
get it done?

01:05:58.166 --> 01:05:59.376
Oh, no doubt in my mind.

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:01.169
At this point,
I would just slow her down

01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:02.879
anyway, so it's probably
for the best.

01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:05.924
[Cody] Unless she
wants you there, of course.

01:06:05.965 --> 01:06:07.342
That wouldn't be so bad.

01:06:13.473 --> 01:06:15.975
[instrumental music]

01:06:20.772 --> 01:06:24.609
Hey, you worked late.
I was getting worried.

01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:27.445
Finishing up is taking longer
than I thought.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:31.658
Oh, I thought about
pulling an all-nighter,

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.661
but I don't think I could lift
a paintbrush right now.

01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:35.954
Oh. You close?

01:06:37.205 --> 01:06:37.872
Good.

01:06:38.748 --> 01:06:39.582
[Olivia] Just one last section I

01:06:39.624 --> 01:06:41.251
haven't been able to nail down.

01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:44.295
A scene with a family
on Christmas.

01:06:44.337 --> 01:06:46.297
I've painted their faces
a dozen times,

01:06:46.339 --> 01:06:48.550
but it's just
never looked right.

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:54.472
Hoping to knock it out tomorrow
morning before the unveiling.

01:06:54.514 --> 01:06:56.474
[Betty] You know,
your father told me

01:06:56.516 --> 01:06:59.019
he had a really nice time
working with you today.

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:03.106
It was quite the conversation
from what I understand.

01:07:03.148 --> 01:07:05.483
You know, if you have

01:07:05.525 --> 01:07:07.986
anything you wanna talk about,
I'm always here.

01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:12.240
I appreciate that
you wanna help,

01:07:12.282 --> 01:07:14.743
but sometimes
your way of helping

01:07:14.784 --> 01:07:18.663
just kind of complicates things.

01:07:18.705 --> 01:07:22.375
I'm sure I don't even know
what you're talking about.

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:25.503
Mom, come on.

01:07:25.545 --> 01:07:28.590
You knew that I was having
trouble painting,

01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:30.383
so you secretly entered me

01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:32.802
in a contest
to try to motivate me.

01:07:32.844 --> 01:07:36.014
You saw that Will and I were
getting along, so you invited

01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:39.309
him over for dinner
and left us stargazing.

01:07:39.351 --> 01:07:40.977
Yes.

01:07:41.019 --> 01:07:44.272
And now you almost finished
painting a mural

01:07:44.314 --> 01:07:46.649
and you kissed a man you liked.

01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:49.361
[Betty inhales]
If it took a little nudging

01:07:49.402 --> 01:07:52.113
for me to get you there,
so be it.

01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:53.907
[Olivia] What about what I want?

01:07:53.948 --> 01:07:55.200
Doesn't that matter?

01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:57.327
Of course it does.

01:07:57.369 --> 01:08:00.872
So tell me, Olivia,
what do you want?

01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:04.125
I just need you to listen,
that's all.

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.628
[instrumental music]

01:08:09.714 --> 01:08:10.882
Okay.

01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:14.678
[chuckles]

01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:18.098
All right. Well...

01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:25.897
I guess I'm having trouble
figuring out

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:26.898
what I'm supposed to do.

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:30.235
Being back home.

01:08:30.276 --> 01:08:33.446
[Olivia] Painting again.
Meeting Will.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:36.116
It's all stirring up
a lot of emotions.

01:08:36.157 --> 01:08:39.285
And they're all good.

01:08:39.327 --> 01:08:41.705
Which... shouldn't be a problem.

01:08:44.457 --> 01:08:48.753
But then... I think about
what that means.

01:08:48.795 --> 01:08:53.425
And the guilt that I feel
for falling for another man,

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:56.678
for picturing a life
outside of New York.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.764
-And that can't happen.
-Why not?

01:08:59.806 --> 01:09:03.351
Because it's the life that
Tom and I built together.

01:09:03.393 --> 01:09:06.688
[Olivia] Parker was born there.

01:09:06.730 --> 01:09:09.649
And I moved to New York
to pursue my career.

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:14.195
So if I leave all that behind,
then I've failed as an artist.

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:17.365
And... if I abandoned the life

01:09:17.407 --> 01:09:18.783
that Tom and I
were building together, then

01:09:18.825 --> 01:09:22.954
I have failed as a wife
and as a mother.

01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:26.875
You are not a failure.
I need you to hear that.

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:28.793
[Betty] And you do know
art exists

01:09:28.835 --> 01:09:31.046
outside of New York, right?

01:09:31.087 --> 01:09:33.631
And you are good enough
to make it anywhere.

01:09:33.673 --> 01:09:36.760
And as far as being
a failure of a mother?

01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:39.304
[laughs]
Well, that's nonsense too.

01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:42.265
You and I both know no matter
where you are, you will give

01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:44.642
Parker everything you've got.

01:09:44.684 --> 01:09:47.103
You will never fail that boy.

01:09:47.145 --> 01:09:49.022
But what about Tom?

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:50.482
[music continues]

01:09:50.523 --> 01:09:52.400
Tom loved you
more than anything.

01:09:52.442 --> 01:09:54.152
And he'll always
be a part of you.

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:56.488
And he'll always want
what's best for you.

01:09:56.529 --> 01:09:59.657
And yes, I know you planned
a life with him.

01:09:59.699 --> 01:10:01.826
And as painful as it is,

01:10:01.868 --> 01:10:05.914
that plan has changed
and you can't keep holding on

01:10:05.955 --> 01:10:08.792
to it at the expense of building
a life for you and Parker.

01:10:11.044 --> 01:10:12.128
[chuckles]

01:10:14.005 --> 01:10:15.048
[Olivia sighs]

01:10:16.383 --> 01:10:18.218
So what am I supposed to do?

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.429
Listen to this.

01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:25.100
Sometimes it's the only guide
you've got.

01:10:25.141 --> 01:10:28.937
And you're not the only one
going through a new life change,

01:10:28.978 --> 01:10:31.731
trying to figure things out.
I mean, look at your father.

01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:35.110
The man's retired and doesn't
know what to do with himself.

01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:37.696
And As for me... [exhales]

01:10:37.737 --> 01:10:41.700
I found myself
in unfamiliar waters, too.

01:10:43.451 --> 01:10:47.747
I had to watch my daughter
go through something terrible,

01:10:47.789 --> 01:10:51.835
and see this bright flame
in her start to fade.

01:10:54.504 --> 01:10:57.382
I don't wanna keep
growing apart, Olivia.

01:10:57.424 --> 01:11:00.385
I wanna be here for you,
if you'll let me.

01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:02.971
[music continues]

01:11:03.596 --> 01:11:04.723
[chuckles]

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.440
It is very unfair of you

01:11:13.481 --> 01:11:15.734
to spring this
conversation on me

01:11:15.775 --> 01:11:18.570
when I am physically
incapable of escaping.

01:11:18.611 --> 01:11:20.739
[laughs]

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.323
Come here, sweetheart.

01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:26.077
[sighs]
You'll be fine. Yeah.

01:11:27.495 --> 01:11:29.122
You'll get past this.

01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:32.625
[birds chirping]

01:11:33.626 --> 01:11:35.128
[Parker] Mom.

01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:38.465
Mom?

01:11:38.506 --> 01:11:41.259
Hey, mom.
Merry Christmas Eve.

01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:43.762
Mom, it's Christmas Eve.

01:11:43.803 --> 01:11:45.930
[instrumental music]

01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:49.726
Merry Christmas Eve, bud.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:52.103
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

01:11:52.145 --> 01:11:53.146
You have a second?

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:54.898
Um...

01:11:56.858 --> 01:11:58.026
So...

01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:03.656
I know the plan was to
head home in a couple days,

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:05.867
but I was wondering
how you would feel

01:12:05.909 --> 01:12:08.703
about staying a little longer.

01:12:08.745 --> 01:12:12.123
Maybe living in Wellington
for a while.

01:12:12.165 --> 01:12:14.334
Like, for good?

01:12:15.502 --> 01:12:18.004
I don't know. Maybe.

01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:20.632
What about school?

01:12:20.674 --> 01:12:23.301
Yeah, you'd have
to change schools.

01:12:23.343 --> 01:12:25.804
And I know that would be tough.

01:12:25.845 --> 01:12:28.807
So hey, please, I need you
to be honest with me, okay?

01:12:28.848 --> 01:12:31.309
Because we can just forget this
whole thing right now.

01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:33.895
[soft music]

01:12:36.398 --> 01:12:38.191
It'll be tough for me, too.

01:12:39.192 --> 01:12:41.778
It's our home.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.239
And it's where your dad...

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.824
His memory lives there.

01:12:49.744 --> 01:12:52.080
[clanks on table]

01:12:52.122 --> 01:12:54.582
Daddy doesn't live there.
He's here.

01:12:54.624 --> 01:12:56.334
He's wherever we are.

01:12:57.502 --> 01:12:58.712
[laughs]

01:13:00.213 --> 01:13:01.840
You're right.

01:13:01.881 --> 01:13:03.216
Of course you're right.

01:13:04.718 --> 01:13:06.344
Your dad and I will
always love you.

01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:08.179
You know that, right?

01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:09.848
[music continues]

01:13:09.889 --> 01:13:12.350
Are you sure you're okay
with all this?

01:13:12.392 --> 01:13:15.270
Yeah. But I do have a question.

01:13:15.311 --> 01:13:16.855
If I go to school here,

01:13:16.896 --> 01:13:20.692
does that mean Mr. Campbell
will be my art teacher?

01:13:20.734 --> 01:13:22.152
[laughs]

01:13:22.193 --> 01:13:24.154
I think so.

01:13:24.195 --> 01:13:26.906
If nothing else, I'm sure
he would love to teach you.

01:13:26.948 --> 01:13:28.366
Yes!

01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:32.412
Grandma! Grandpa! Guess what!

01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:39.252
[phone ringing]

01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:42.172
Cody Miller,
Director of Recreation

01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:43.757
and Community Services.
How can I help you?

01:13:43.798 --> 01:13:45.383
[Olivia] Hey, Cody,
it's Olivia.

01:13:45.425 --> 01:13:47.260
Olivia, great to hear from you.

01:13:47.302 --> 01:13:50.138
-You got good news for me?
-Oh, uh, yeah.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.891
I'm just on my way to the mural
to do some final touch ups,

01:13:52.932 --> 01:13:55.560
but we should be all good
for the unveiling this evening.

01:13:55.602 --> 01:13:58.229
[laughs] Okay, good. Uh...

01:13:58.271 --> 01:14:01.775
If you told me you weren't done,
I might have had a heart attack.

01:14:01.816 --> 01:14:03.401
Forget I said that,
I have full faith in you.

01:14:03.443 --> 01:14:04.986
Right.

01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:06.654
Um...

01:14:06.696 --> 01:14:08.907
I'm actually calling
because I wanted

01:14:08.948 --> 01:14:10.116
to get your help with something.

01:14:10.158 --> 01:14:12.327
Of course. Anything you need.

01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:14.829
[Olivia] I'm sure by now
you have seen Will

01:14:14.871 --> 01:14:18.750
and you've heard
what's going on.

01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:20.293
And I was hoping...

01:14:22.796 --> 01:14:25.924
Will and I haven't talked
since that night

01:14:25.965 --> 01:14:30.261
and... I really want him
to be there tonight.

01:14:30.303 --> 01:14:32.263
It's important.

01:14:32.305 --> 01:14:35.475
So... do you think you could
make sure that he comes?

01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:38.228
That's it?

01:14:38.269 --> 01:14:40.146
Sure.
I was gonna do that anyway.

01:14:40.188 --> 01:14:42.565
He needs to support the
Community Services Department.

01:14:42.607 --> 01:14:44.025
And me, frankly.

01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:46.528
I did want to talk to you
about something else.

01:14:46.569 --> 01:14:48.321
Do you have some time
right now?

01:14:51.408 --> 01:14:53.827
[Christmas choir singing]

01:14:53.868 --> 01:14:56.329
[indistinct chatter]

01:15:01.501 --> 01:15:02.669
Hey, Merry Christmas.

01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:04.337
Hi guys. Hi.

01:15:05.463 --> 01:15:07.007
[Ivy] He's so cute.

01:15:07.048 --> 01:15:09.342
[singing continues]

01:15:12.554 --> 01:15:14.180
Good evening, everyone.

01:15:14.222 --> 01:15:17.017
On behalf of the Community
Services Department

01:15:17.058 --> 01:15:19.019
[Cody] it gives me great joy
to welcome you

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.104
to the Wellington Winter Walks
inaugural

01:15:21.146 --> 01:15:23.356
Christmas Eve mural unveiling!

01:15:23.398 --> 01:15:25.900
[cheers and applause]

01:15:28.153 --> 01:15:29.863
In our ongoing efforts

01:15:29.904 --> 01:15:32.157
to engage the community
through the arts,

01:15:32.198 --> 01:15:35.243
we hope this is the first
of many new initiatives

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:37.454
to bring our town together.

01:15:37.495 --> 01:15:38.913
But enough from me.

01:15:38.955 --> 01:15:40.707
We're here for the art,

01:15:40.749 --> 01:15:43.835
and it only makes sense to
turn things over to the artist.

01:15:43.877 --> 01:15:46.588
So let's all give a big hand
for Olivia.

01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:49.007
[cheers and applause]

01:15:53.636 --> 01:15:55.388
Thank you so much, everyone.

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:59.059
Um, it really means the world
that you all came out tonight.

01:16:01.686 --> 01:16:06.733
I have a lot of people in my
life that I want to thank.

01:16:06.775 --> 01:16:11.112
My dad, Mack,
who worked tirelessly

01:16:11.154 --> 01:16:13.615
to make sure that we had
a proper space to work.

01:16:13.656 --> 01:16:16.076
[cheers and applause]

01:16:17.077 --> 01:16:19.079
My mom, Betty,

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.916
who is the reason
I entered this contest

01:16:22.957 --> 01:16:26.711
and who is always
rooting for me.

01:16:26.753 --> 01:16:31.383
My son Parker,
who is my everything.

01:16:31.424 --> 01:16:33.093
[soft music]

01:16:33.134 --> 01:16:35.553
[Olivia] And one more person...

01:16:35.595 --> 01:16:37.681
It was with the help
of a fellow artist

01:16:37.722 --> 01:16:43.353
that I was able to overcome
my creative block,

01:16:43.395 --> 01:16:48.233
and finally open myself back up
to letting the world in again.

01:16:49.401 --> 01:16:51.444
And he deserves
to be up here too.

01:16:52.862 --> 01:16:54.614
So...

01:16:54.656 --> 01:16:56.616
Will...

01:16:56.658 --> 01:16:58.993
would you like to come
and help me do the honors?

01:16:59.035 --> 01:17:00.829
-Yeah, get up there.
-Come on, Will, get up there.

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.706
[Olivia] Will Campbell,
everyone.

01:17:02.747 --> 01:17:05.125
[cheers and applause]

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.633
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:18.138
I want to thank you, Will,

01:17:18.179 --> 01:17:22.392
for...being my partner
when I needed one.

01:17:23.893 --> 01:17:27.063
I know that I made
things difficult,

01:17:27.105 --> 01:17:29.607
but you helped me see
what was missing.

01:17:30.942 --> 01:17:33.111
And you helped me
realize what I want.

01:17:36.781 --> 01:17:38.533
Uh...

01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:41.619
I have just one more
announcement, um,

01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:43.997
before we unveil the mural.

01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:46.833
[Olivia] I am overjoyed
to tell you

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:50.211
that the canvas for this piece,

01:17:50.253 --> 01:17:52.172
which has served
as a second home

01:17:52.213 --> 01:17:54.299
since I've been here,

01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:58.219
well, it's not going to
remain vacant any longer.

01:17:58.261 --> 01:18:01.681
Working in tandem with the
Community Services Department...

01:18:01.723 --> 01:18:02.640
Whoo!

01:18:02.849 --> 01:18:03.683
[Olivia] I will be transforming

01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:05.852
this space into a studio

01:18:05.894 --> 01:18:08.772
and a gallery
to create and display

01:18:08.813 --> 01:18:13.860
works of art from myself
and fellow Wellington artists,

01:18:13.902 --> 01:18:17.822
as well as anyone else who
wants to engage with the arts.

01:18:17.864 --> 01:18:20.283
[cheers and applause]

01:18:23.828 --> 01:18:24.746
So...

01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:28.625
without any further ado...

01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:31.336
[instrumental music]

01:18:39.052 --> 01:18:41.179
We present to you

01:18:41.221 --> 01:18:43.223
"A Wellington Christmas."

01:18:45.642 --> 01:18:47.227
[triumphant music]

01:18:47.268 --> 01:18:49.729
[cheers and applause]

01:18:56.027 --> 01:18:58.488
[indistinct chatter]

01:19:03.326 --> 01:19:04.494
Will...

01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:11.918
I'm so sorry for pushing
you away the other night.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.628
I just...

01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:15.422
I panicked.

01:19:15.463 --> 01:19:19.968
And then I felt guilty
and embarrassed.

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:21.511
[soft music]

01:19:21.553 --> 01:19:23.179
But I-I really don't want that

01:19:23.221 --> 01:19:25.807
to be the way
that we leave things.

01:19:25.849 --> 01:19:28.268
Because I realized that...

01:19:29.352 --> 01:19:31.354
I'm ready to fall in love again.

01:19:32.439 --> 01:19:33.356
And...

01:19:35.734 --> 01:19:38.278
I am falling in love.

01:19:38.319 --> 01:19:41.281
But if you don't feel the same
way, I-I completely understand.

01:19:41.322 --> 01:19:45.660
I just... I wanted to make it
perfectly clear that, um...

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.288
[softly chuckles]

01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:51.499
Parker and I...

01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:55.128
We want you in the picture.

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:57.547
[music continues]

01:20:04.387 --> 01:20:06.431
I wanna be in the picture.

01:20:07.849 --> 01:20:08.850
[laughs]

01:20:25.116 --> 01:20:27.744
[sparkle sprinkling]

01:20:27.786 --> 01:20:29.788

01:20:32.874 --> 01:20:35.460
[Christmas choir singing]

01:20:38.546 --> 01:20:40.090
[Will] Now, these are
fun to decorate,

01:20:40.131 --> 01:20:42.258
but I have to be honest,

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.302
I'm mostly excited
about eating them.

01:20:44.344 --> 01:20:46.680
[Olivia and Ivy
chatting and laughing]

01:20:48.598 --> 01:20:50.517
Wonderful speech tonight,
Olivia.

01:20:50.558 --> 01:20:52.686
I'm really excited to see
what you do with the studio.

01:20:52.727 --> 01:20:54.312
Thanks, Cody. Me too.

01:20:54.354 --> 01:20:57.357
Ivy, um, this is long overdue,

01:20:57.399 --> 01:21:00.443
but I owe you an apology for
how I left our date last year.

01:21:00.485 --> 01:21:03.780
I can sometimes let work get in
the way of my personal life.

01:21:03.822 --> 01:21:05.240
Apology accepted.

01:21:05.281 --> 01:21:07.409
And also, Cody,

01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:09.369
I just have to say,
I think it's pretty cool

01:21:09.411 --> 01:21:12.580
how you're always supporting
the arts in this town.

01:21:12.622 --> 01:21:14.124
Woah. Was that a compliment?

01:21:14.165 --> 01:21:15.333
Don't let it get to your head.

01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:17.043
[all laughing]

01:21:17.085 --> 01:21:18.586
[Cody] Hey, can I buy you
hot chocolate?

01:21:18.628 --> 01:21:20.922
To make up
for my past decisions.

01:21:20.964 --> 01:21:23.049
They're free, you weirdo.

01:21:23.091 --> 01:21:24.259
But sure.

01:21:28.179 --> 01:21:30.473
Hey.

01:21:30.515 --> 01:21:34.227
I have to thank you, mom,
for giving me a nudge.

01:21:34.269 --> 01:21:35.562
-You were right.
-Oh.

01:21:35.603 --> 01:21:36.771
I needed it.

01:21:36.813 --> 01:21:39.065
[laughing]

01:21:39.107 --> 01:21:43.737
So, Cody says that he thinks he
might be able to get me a deal

01:21:43.778 --> 01:21:48.408
on rent if I agree to host
community events at the studio.

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:50.994
But that means
I'm going to really need

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:53.038
some help getting it
into shape.

01:21:53.079 --> 01:21:55.999
I think I can find some time
for a project like that.

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:57.459
-[Betty laughing]
-Great.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.919
But I am not going to
let you work too hard.

01:21:59.961 --> 01:22:02.464
I know you're having trouble
with retirement,

01:22:02.505 --> 01:22:05.425
but if there's one thing I've
learned since I've been home,

01:22:05.467 --> 01:22:06.760
is that change is good.

01:22:06.801 --> 01:22:08.261
Okay.

01:22:08.303 --> 01:22:10.597
But I'm not too worried
about it.

01:22:10.638 --> 01:22:13.183
You know, with the studio and
having you and Parker

01:22:13.224 --> 01:22:15.268
home again,
the future is looking

01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:16.811
pretty bright, sweetheart.

01:22:16.853 --> 01:22:18.438
I think you should
get over there.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.315
-[Olivia chuckles]
-[Parker] Come on, mom.

01:22:20.357 --> 01:22:22.108
You need to make a cookie, too.

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:24.402
[laughing]

01:22:25.653 --> 01:22:26.988
I would love to.

01:22:29.324 --> 01:22:32.869
I got to admit, I am
looking forward to doing

01:22:32.911 --> 01:22:34.788
stuff like this more often.

01:22:34.829 --> 01:22:36.790
Yeah, me too.

01:22:38.917 --> 01:22:43.129
So... I was thinking.

01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:46.383
Seeing as how the studio
has successfully

01:22:46.424 --> 01:22:49.469
already hosted
some art therapy sessions,

01:22:49.511 --> 01:22:53.473
it might be a good space
to host some more.

01:22:53.515 --> 01:22:56.101
And it's a great place for any

01:22:56.142 --> 01:22:59.938
after-school art programs
you were thinking of teaching.

01:22:59.979 --> 01:23:02.482
If that's something
you would be interested in.

01:23:03.775 --> 01:23:05.235
I would love to.
