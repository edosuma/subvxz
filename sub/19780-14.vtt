WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:05.973
I am a student of life and light,

00:05.975 --> 00:07.608
but in order to bask in the light,

00:07.610 --> 00:10.511
we need to first outshine the darkness.

00:10.513 --> 00:11.412
- Dana?
- Yeah?

00:11.413 --> 00:12.478
I want you to close your eyes.

00:12.481 --> 00:14.248
What are we doing here?

00:14.250 --> 00:15.749
- I want you to know this...
- Currently?

00:15.751 --> 00:16.984
Yes.

00:16.986 --> 00:20.187
We are opening our sacral chakras.

00:20.189 --> 00:21.422
Okay.

00:21.424 --> 00:26.026
Your past does not equal your future.

00:26.028 --> 00:28.996
Though I am pretty sure
my chakra's broken.

00:30.866 --> 00:32.966
I can book you in for a chakra-ectomy.

00:34.203 --> 00:36.437
Ladies, I'm trying to meditate.

00:36.439 --> 00:37.671
Oh.

00:37.673 --> 00:39.139
- So are we.
- Breath.

00:39.141 --> 00:40.674
Well, you're doing it wrong.

00:43.312 --> 00:48.282
And true forgiveness
is letting go of the idea

00:48.284 --> 00:51.018
that your past could have been
any different than it is.

00:51.020 --> 00:53.620
I want you to stop doing
what you think you should.

00:53.622 --> 00:55.789
I want you to start doing
what you feel.

00:55.791 --> 00:57.858
How's it going with Charlie anyway?

00:57.860 --> 01:00.060
To choose to...

01:00.062 --> 01:03.363
You two are still clearly
nuts about each other...

01:03.365 --> 01:05.532
just what's keeping you apart?

01:05.534 --> 01:07.801
I'm trying to meditate.

01:07.803 --> 01:11.004
I know... uh, um...

01:11.006 --> 01:13.407
Ow.

01:13.409 --> 01:15.242
- Ohm.
- Ohm.

01:15.244 --> 01:16.710
Ow!

01:16.712 --> 01:18.216
- I don't think this is part of the class.
- Ow!

01:18.217 --> 01:19.413
I don't think so, either.

01:19.415 --> 01:23.717
Aah! Please keep going
with your... meditation.

01:23.719 --> 01:26.320
My name is Alex, I'm a doctor.

01:26.322 --> 01:28.188
Could you just lay back for us?

01:28.190 --> 01:30.190
Here you go. There you go.

01:30.192 --> 01:31.358
Can you tell us where it hurts?

01:31.360 --> 01:33.760
- Yeah, my solar plexus, I think.
- Uh-huh.

01:33.762 --> 01:35.162
Do you mind if I check it out?

01:35.164 --> 01:36.830
Can I take your pulse?

01:39.234 --> 01:42.236
There is a large protrusion
in the upper left quadrant.

01:42.238 --> 01:44.438
I think we better take her in.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.039
Class, I am so sorry
for this distraction.

01:46.041 --> 01:49.510
Please just continue with
your practice right now.

01:49.512 --> 01:51.245
Oh, you guys, I can breathe
through this, okay?

01:51.247 --> 01:52.312
I'm fine.

01:52.314 --> 01:54.648
Oh, okay, no. Uh, class is dismissed.

01:54.650 --> 01:56.016
Everybody just roll up your mats.

01:56.018 --> 01:58.118
We need to take her to the hospital.

02:00.689 --> 02:03.190
- 3, 2, 1.
- Oof.

02:03.192 --> 02:05.526
Oh. Your mind is a fountain of worry.

02:05.528 --> 02:07.528
- You can say that about any surgeon.
- Mm-hmm.

02:07.530 --> 02:09.229
How long has this been bothering you?

02:09.231 --> 02:11.798
On and off, I'd say a few weeks.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.768
All right, Layla, I'm going to
attempt to reduce this manually.

02:14.770 --> 02:16.537
You may feel some pressure.

02:16.539 --> 02:18.372
Here we go. Ready?

02:18.374 --> 02:21.208
Aah!

02:24.046 --> 02:26.380
Could be incarcerated.
We'll need to run some tests.

02:26.382 --> 02:28.615
I don't know if I'll be able to
guide this in without surgery.

02:28.617 --> 02:30.050
No.

02:30.052 --> 02:32.519
Look, I already had surgery
when I was a kid. Didn't work.

02:32.521 --> 02:34.621
Every few years,
it just comes back knocking.

02:34.623 --> 02:36.123
On your abdominal wall?

02:36.125 --> 02:37.991
Sorry, it's a doctor joke.

02:37.993 --> 02:40.093
I know it's stubborn, but I can
handle this without surgery.

02:40.095 --> 02:42.229
Layla's, uh, quite famous, actually,

02:42.231 --> 02:44.164
for her self-guided healing techniques.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.099
Well, we are going to
check you out anyway,

02:46.101 --> 02:47.334
as long as you're in our house.

02:47.336 --> 02:49.102
Shut up and drink the pharma Kool-Aid.

02:49.104 --> 02:51.805
Not exactly how I'd put it.

02:51.807 --> 02:53.574
Don't you think
it's a little bit strange

02:53.576 --> 02:55.976
you guys push chemicals
as conventional medicine,

02:55.978 --> 02:57.511
yet nutrition is alternative?

02:57.513 --> 02:59.479
That's a rather simplistic way
of thinking about things.

02:59.481 --> 03:02.449
Life is simple.
It's <i>us</i> who make it complicated.

03:02.451 --> 03:04.051
Incoming!

03:04.053 --> 03:06.219
Oh, darn, I'd like to stay
and see how this plays out,

03:06.221 --> 03:07.621
but duty calls.

03:07.623 --> 03:08.655
Play nice, you two.

03:08.657 --> 03:11.592
Aah! Help me, I'm dying!

03:11.594 --> 03:13.060
- Louder!
- There is blood everywhere!

03:13.062 --> 03:15.228
- No!
- Aah!

03:15.230 --> 03:16.563
- Aah!
- Louder!

03:16.565 --> 03:18.098
Don't listen to him, he's fine.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.933
Zip it.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.669
- Spaghetti.
- Ah.

03:22.671 --> 03:24.471
He's been doing this the whole
ride over to the medic center.

03:24.473 --> 03:25.706
Should she be filming in here?

03:25.708 --> 03:27.040
No, she should not.
Hey, what did I tell you?

03:27.042 --> 03:28.542
Give me that camera.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.078
Thank you.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.814
Dom and Iris, amateur filmmakers.

03:33.816 --> 03:36.984
They were shooting in their
tree house when it collapsed.

03:36.986 --> 03:38.585
Hey, kids, I'm Dana.

03:38.587 --> 03:40.187
So you must be brother and sister.

03:40.189 --> 03:41.355
- We're twins.
- We're twins.

03:41.357 --> 03:42.856
Oh, complete with the creepy

03:42.858 --> 03:44.758
- talking at the same time vibe.
- At the same time vibe.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.960
Weird. All right.

03:46.962 --> 03:49.029
Littlest Hitchcocks are yours.

03:49.031 --> 03:52.799
All right. You want to show me
where that hurts?

03:52.801 --> 03:54.768
I'm just gonna...

03:54.770 --> 03:57.037
Ow, I told you that hurts.

03:57.039 --> 03:58.572
Okay.

03:58.574 --> 04:00.574
I'm gonna need to run a few tests.

04:00.576 --> 04:02.909
Can you give us a number
where we can call your parents?

04:02.911 --> 04:05.312
No. Our dad can't find out about this.

04:05.314 --> 04:07.681
He's a TV producer, and if we
pull him out of his meetings...

04:07.683 --> 04:10.150
- We're dead.
- Like 6-feet-under dead. I'm not kidding.

04:10.152 --> 04:13.153
Really? Well, lucky for you,
I know a great mortician.

04:13.155 --> 04:15.522
You can even use
my frequent die-ah miles.

04:15.524 --> 04:16.790
Is this thing on?

04:16.791 --> 04:18.759
Hey, that was pretty good. Come on.

04:18.761 --> 04:20.694
All right. Take Scorsese here
up to imaging.

04:20.696 --> 04:22.429
You wait for me.
I'm not done with you yet.

04:22.431 --> 04:24.665
And call their parents.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.769
How's it going in there?

04:28.771 --> 04:30.904
Gonna be one of those days.

04:32.941 --> 04:35.776
I need more suction, please.
Pressure's dropping.

04:35.778 --> 04:38.311
Give me a minute. Six-oh.

04:38.313 --> 04:40.614
- Lost visual.
- Clamp!

04:40.616 --> 04:43.216
Hey, Charlie, the legs can wait.

04:43.218 --> 04:44.651
Assist the kid with the bleeders.

04:44.653 --> 04:46.219
Charlie, come on, what are you doing?

04:46.221 --> 04:47.788
You heard the lady... get in there!

04:47.790 --> 04:49.089
He's crashing.

04:49.091 --> 04:51.291
Damn it, I need more volume.

04:51.293 --> 04:53.994
Oh, come on, I need more blood here!

04:53.996 --> 04:56.096
- He's not gonna make it.
- Yes, he will.

04:56.098 --> 04:57.230
Help me.

04:57.232 --> 04:58.765
Seriously, what are you waiting for?

04:58.767 --> 05:00.400
Save me!

05:00.402 --> 05:02.135
Dr. Harris.

05:02.137 --> 05:03.270
Charlie!

05:03.272 --> 05:04.671
Charlie!

05:30.064 --> 05:31.965
What are you doing?

05:33.668 --> 05:35.836
Don't.

05:35.838 --> 05:38.004
Charlie.

05:38.006 --> 05:39.639
Charlie!

05:48.886 --> 05:50.153
What the hell was that?

05:50.155 --> 05:51.788
You just walked out of surgery.

05:51.790 --> 05:53.589
- What happened in there?
- I'm not chief anymore, Dawn.

05:53.591 --> 05:54.791
You don't have to worry about me.

05:54.793 --> 05:56.793
Well, maybe you should worry about you.

05:56.795 --> 05:58.761
- They called me.
- Who did?

05:58.763 --> 06:01.364
Evelyn Crace, the board.
There's been complaints.

06:01.366 --> 06:03.299
So what?
They want you to replace me?

06:03.301 --> 06:05.134
No. Not yet.

06:05.136 --> 06:07.303
Know what? I'm tired, Dawn.

06:07.305 --> 06:09.973
You want the job back,
now's your chance.

06:09.975 --> 06:11.374
Look at me.

06:12.609 --> 06:13.910
- They know.
- They know what?

06:13.912 --> 06:16.579
What do they know?
They know who you've been.

06:16.581 --> 06:19.048
Half the staff has a story
about working with you.

06:19.050 --> 06:21.284
So what? They think I'm crazy?

06:21.286 --> 06:22.819
It's gotten worse, Char.

06:24.588 --> 06:27.857
Just... I just want you
to go talk to somebody.

06:28.959 --> 06:32.261
Yeah. I'll get right on that.

06:38.936 --> 06:39.936
Layla.

06:39.938 --> 06:41.537
Hey.

06:41.539 --> 06:44.540
I'm just doing some positive
visualizations.

06:46.443 --> 06:49.579
Well, imaging has confirmed the
size and location of the hernia.

06:49.581 --> 06:54.017
Now, we had hoped to reduce it
noninvasively.

06:54.019 --> 06:55.918
But?

06:55.920 --> 06:58.354
But I'm worried that it's strangulated.

06:58.356 --> 07:00.156
Okay.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.425
Well, then you just need to focus.

07:02.427 --> 07:05.294
I mean, clearly,
our energies aren't aligned.

07:05.296 --> 07:07.296
This isn't about energy.

07:07.298 --> 07:10.500
This is about ischemic tissue
that won't cooperate.

07:10.502 --> 07:13.603
I'm saying that if <i>we</i> cooperate,
then <i>it</i> will.

07:13.605 --> 07:14.937
Trust me.

07:14.939 --> 07:17.006
If we try this, it'll work.

07:17.008 --> 07:19.175
No, it'll only get worse.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.943
What, you want to cut me open?

07:20.945 --> 07:23.346
I have to open your abdomen
and put the tissue back.

07:23.348 --> 07:24.914
Well, I'm not having surgery again.

07:24.916 --> 07:27.216
Layla, if a piece of your bowel
is trapped,

07:27.218 --> 07:28.284
the obstruction could kill you.

07:28.286 --> 07:30.153
So you trying to solve this
on your own,

07:30.155 --> 07:31.821
you're taking your life in your hands.

07:31.823 --> 07:33.056
You don't mince words.

07:33.058 --> 07:34.857
So do you consent for surgery?

07:34.859 --> 07:36.626
Yeah, as long as you
don't put me under.

07:36.628 --> 07:38.561
The only way to safely
reduce the tissue

07:38.563 --> 07:40.229
is with general anesthetic.

07:40.231 --> 07:42.999
Or I can breathe through it.
Which I can.

07:43.001 --> 07:45.835
Look, if we do this,
I need to be fully conscious.

07:45.837 --> 07:47.737
If not, I'm out.

07:47.739 --> 07:51.507
No, Layla. This is crazy.

07:51.509 --> 07:53.176
Why don't you tell me why?

07:53.178 --> 07:54.877
This is my temple.

07:54.879 --> 07:58.081
All right. Well, as a patient,
that is your right.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.482
I will let the nursing staff know

07:59.484 --> 08:01.417
that you would like to consult
with another surgeon.

08:01.419 --> 08:04.520
Have a namaste.

08:04.522 --> 08:06.089
Billy, the schedule is set.

08:06.091 --> 08:07.523
Yes, but you can un-set it.

08:07.525 --> 08:09.192
So come on, why don't you
give me something juicy?

08:09.194 --> 08:10.526
Ow!

08:10.528 --> 08:12.261
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:12.263 --> 08:13.329
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Stop! Stop!

08:13.331 --> 08:14.597
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey! Stop!

08:14.599 --> 08:16.666
Hey! What is this?

08:16.668 --> 08:18.901
- Are you okay? Cassie?
- I'm fine.

08:18.903 --> 08:20.470
- You need security?
- Yeah.

08:20.472 --> 08:22.338
No. It's fine.

08:22.340 --> 08:24.707
They're gonna be right here.

08:24.709 --> 08:27.844
I'm Cassie. Who are you?

08:27.846 --> 08:30.613
The Horn of Death.

08:30.615 --> 08:33.082
Jake... Jake Bugle.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.450
Get it?

08:34.452 --> 08:36.318
- This guy thinks I'm on steroids.
- Okay.

08:36.321 --> 08:37.720
I was trying to clean glass
out of his back.

08:37.722 --> 08:38.888
He was acting agitated,

08:38.890 --> 08:40.957
so I suggested a tox screen,
and he just...

08:40.958 --> 08:42.291
Yeah, you said it with a smirk.

08:42.293 --> 08:44.059
Yeah, dude,
you're wearing blue spandex.

08:44.062 --> 08:45.561
Just saying it's kind of hard
not to smirk.

08:45.563 --> 08:47.296
Billy. You want something to do,
go get Dev cleaned up.

08:47.298 --> 08:49.198
- I'm not leaving you alone with him.
- I'm fine.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.334
It's fine.

08:51.336 --> 08:53.069
I can handle it.

08:54.638 --> 08:55.938
Sit.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.773
Sit!

09:06.250 --> 09:08.050
So this glass...

09:08.052 --> 09:09.986
Part of the show.

09:13.157 --> 09:17.126
Cassie, that's, uh,
short for Cassandra, right?

09:17.128 --> 09:18.394
Like that myth.

09:18.396 --> 09:20.930
I don't know it.

09:20.932 --> 09:22.899
Well, she was beautiful, too.

09:22.901 --> 09:25.101
Too bad things
didn't go so good for her.

09:26.436 --> 09:31.507
I wasn't always like this,
you know. I used to read.

09:31.509 --> 09:33.643
Now I can't even think!

09:35.245 --> 09:36.946
Hey. Hey!

09:38.416 --> 09:39.582
Stop.

09:39.584 --> 09:41.450
You've come to the right place.

09:41.452 --> 09:44.353
Okay?

09:44.355 --> 09:46.589
I'm gonna figure out
what's wrong with you.

09:53.263 --> 09:55.631
Dr. Harris.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.433
Amos.

09:57.435 --> 10:00.002
Are... Are you going somewhere?

10:00.004 --> 10:01.037
Yeah.

10:01.039 --> 10:03.206
Is that a good idea?

10:03.208 --> 10:05.441
Would you be here if it was?

10:06.643 --> 10:07.743
Dawn sent you?

10:07.745 --> 10:09.212
Well, she's worried about you.

10:09.214 --> 10:11.247
Well, I don't need talk. I need sleep.

10:11.249 --> 10:12.848
And are you having trouble with that?

10:12.850 --> 10:14.150
Sleeping?

10:14.152 --> 10:17.353
Seriously? You want to do this here?

10:17.355 --> 10:19.789
You walked out of surgery,
Charlie. You need help.

10:19.791 --> 10:22.091
If you walk out of here now,
it's not just your job on the line,

10:22.093 --> 10:23.859
it's your medical license, so...

10:23.861 --> 10:26.629
"So" doesn't sound like
I have much choice, then.

10:26.631 --> 10:28.731
Just sit down with me and talk.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.533
I'll get the board off your back.

10:32.704 --> 10:34.971
Let me help you.

10:39.544 --> 10:41.043
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:41.045 --> 10:43.846
Your self-help guru just fired me.

10:45.515 --> 10:47.950
Guess that means
I'm not getting my money back.

10:47.952 --> 10:49.652
Kidding. Her loss.

10:49.654 --> 10:52.054
So, um, I wanted to ask...

10:52.056 --> 10:54.323
h-how are you feeling
after all that, anyway?

10:54.325 --> 10:56.092
I don't know. The same.

10:56.094 --> 10:57.593
Huh.

10:57.595 --> 11:00.029
I hate to admit it, but it's
actually got me thinking

11:00.031 --> 11:02.832
- about a few things regarding you.
- Oh.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.834
And you still haven't
answered my question.

11:04.836 --> 11:06.168
About what?

11:06.170 --> 11:08.204
What is keeping you
and everyone's favorite orthopod

11:08.206 --> 11:09.639
apart?

11:09.641 --> 11:11.574
Dana, you are like a broken record.

11:11.576 --> 11:14.277
I just... I just want you happy,
sweetheart. That's all.

11:14.279 --> 11:17.013
Okay, well, I think about him
pretty much all the time.

11:17.015 --> 11:18.347
- I just...
- I knew it!

11:18.349 --> 11:21.450
Dr. Reid?
Layla Rowland's paperwork.

11:21.452 --> 11:23.886
You can't be discharged
with a bowl obstruction.

11:23.888 --> 11:25.788
- On whose orders?
- Hers.

11:25.790 --> 11:28.124
Okay, well I'm gonna take care of this.

11:29.560 --> 11:33.129
I am intelligent. I am successful.

11:33.131 --> 11:35.998
I have a stable home environment.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
- Shahir?
- I am intelligent.

11:38.002 --> 11:40.036
- Hi, Dana.
- What's going on?

11:40.038 --> 11:43.606
This is a little preparation
for the adoption agency.

11:43.608 --> 11:45.574
Jonathan and I have
a follow-up interview.

11:45.576 --> 11:47.543
- That's great!
- Is it?

11:47.545 --> 11:49.345
Because the last time,
I spent seven minutes

11:49.347 --> 11:52.014
explaining the odors unique
to exposed brain tissue...

11:52.016 --> 11:55.051
- faintly feminine with a hint of mildew.
- Yep.

11:55.053 --> 11:57.119
If I don't learn how to
talk to these individuals,

11:57.121 --> 11:59.021
I'm afraid he's just gonna leave.

11:59.023 --> 12:01.123
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.426
Dana, this whole idea was mine
in the first place,

12:03.428 --> 12:05.394
but this is all he's thinking
about, is being a father.

12:05.396 --> 12:07.296
Now, if I can't give that to him,

12:07.298 --> 12:09.165
- then why should he stay, hmm?
- Because you're a...

12:09.167 --> 12:11.867
Aah!

12:11.869 --> 12:13.736
Uh, excuse me.

12:13.738 --> 12:15.271
Hmm.

12:19.043 --> 12:20.976
I am intelligent.

12:25.248 --> 12:27.483
Aah!

12:27.485 --> 12:29.752
Dom, you've had a serious fall.

12:29.754 --> 12:33.289
If you don't lie still, it's not gonna be
your dad that kills you.

12:33.291 --> 12:35.591
How'd you get that back, huh?

12:35.593 --> 12:36.625
Damn it, Miller.

12:36.627 --> 12:38.327
Okay, come here. Sit down, both of you.

12:38.329 --> 12:39.729
I want to show you something.

12:41.098 --> 12:44.967
This, my friend, is your liver.

12:44.969 --> 12:49.271
And that little speck
right there is a laceration.

12:49.273 --> 12:51.407
- Now, it's small...
- Cool.

12:51.409 --> 12:53.843
No, not cool, 'cause we have to
keep you under observation

12:53.845 --> 12:55.911
for the next 24 hours.

12:55.913 --> 12:58.114
So that means that you're gonna
have to stay put...

12:58.116 --> 12:59.148
no sudden movement.

12:59.150 --> 13:00.916
But we're making our horror movie!

13:00.918 --> 13:03.185
It's not going really great.

13:03.187 --> 13:07.256
Have you thought about switching
to documentaries?

13:12.763 --> 13:14.230
Leaving?

13:14.232 --> 13:17.133
Yeah, uh, one of my students
is a doctor in Ixtapa.

13:17.135 --> 13:19.268
Said she'd do it my way.

13:19.270 --> 13:22.071
Amer and his Honda Civic
are three minutes out.

13:22.073 --> 13:23.172
I meant what I said.

13:23.174 --> 13:24.840
You're taking your own life
in your hands.

13:24.842 --> 13:27.243
By taking an Uber?

13:27.245 --> 13:29.578
Come on, it's just a joke.

13:29.580 --> 13:30.980
This isn't.

13:30.982 --> 13:33.048
I know that.

13:33.050 --> 13:35.117
All due respect,

13:35.119 --> 13:37.386
whose hands do you think my life
should be in right now?

13:37.388 --> 13:38.821
Mine.

13:41.291 --> 13:44.126
All due respect, Layla...

13:46.396 --> 13:47.997
this is the wrong choice.

13:49.033 --> 13:51.667
Ah, well, it's <i>my</i> choice.

13:53.203 --> 13:55.538
I'm choosing this.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.840
Why is that so important to you?

13:59.276 --> 14:02.077
It's not even gonna matter to you, why.

14:02.079 --> 14:03.813
Really?

14:06.550 --> 14:07.683
Okay.

14:07.685 --> 14:09.685
Uh, last time I was unconscious,

14:09.687 --> 14:10.920
I woke up behind a dumpster

14:10.922 --> 14:13.522
with the captain of
the rowing team on top of me.

14:13.524 --> 14:17.126
I know you think I'm nuts. I'm not.

14:17.128 --> 14:22.031
I have worked very hard to
turn my pain into strength.

14:22.033 --> 14:24.400
And you know what really matters to me?

14:24.402 --> 14:26.635
It's that every girl knows
that she can do the same.

14:26.637 --> 14:28.804
It starts with me.

14:28.806 --> 14:29.805
I got to go.

14:29.807 --> 14:32.208
No. Layla, stay.

14:32.210 --> 14:36.111
I don't know how,
but I'll figure it out.

14:38.248 --> 14:41.383
Uh, how long this takes depends on you.

14:41.385 --> 14:43.619
I can't say that's the vibe I'm getting.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.254
I feel I need to be clear.

14:45.256 --> 14:47.156
I'm here to evaluate

14:47.158 --> 14:50.025
an episode with a patient
who was in a critical condition,

14:50.027 --> 14:53.062
and my job is to determine
whether that was a one-off...

14:53.064 --> 14:54.196
It was.

14:54.198 --> 14:57.466
Or if there's any risk
of it happening again.

14:57.468 --> 14:59.602
So...

14:59.604 --> 15:02.872
You had been working a long shift.

15:02.874 --> 15:05.908
Thirty hours by my count.

15:05.910 --> 15:09.812
And remind me... that's longer
than the limit, isn't it?

15:09.814 --> 15:12.181
And then, as I understand it,

15:12.183 --> 15:15.584
you left the hospital finally,
only to come right back in.

15:15.586 --> 15:17.353
Yeah, that's right.

15:17.355 --> 15:19.288
So let's talk about what happened

15:19.290 --> 15:21.457
after you left the hospital.

15:22.759 --> 15:24.894
I was driving home.

15:24.896 --> 15:27.863
The radio was on.

15:27.865 --> 15:31.000
Usually, I can't find anything I like.

15:31.002 --> 15:36.305
But, um, this time,
every song was just right.

15:36.307 --> 15:38.507
I was in a good mood.

15:55.058 --> 15:57.493
Yeah, I'll stay with him. Thank you.

15:57.495 --> 15:59.895
Ambulance is on its way.

15:59.897 --> 16:01.397
I told you I don't need one.

16:01.399 --> 16:03.566
Yeah.

16:03.568 --> 16:06.402
I'd take you myself, but it's
been a long day, you know?

16:06.404 --> 16:10.005
It's a freaking nosebleed.
You think I haven't had worse?

16:10.007 --> 16:11.874
A couple years ago at Mardi Gras...

16:13.544 --> 16:16.111
You ever been to New Orleans? It's...

16:17.747 --> 16:19.214
Where did you say your car was?

16:19.216 --> 16:21.183
Ah, don't worry about the car.

16:21.185 --> 16:22.818
It's a piece of junk.

16:22.820 --> 16:26.055
I just need a ride into town.
I can't be late again.

16:26.057 --> 16:28.857
Don't... get up.

16:28.859 --> 16:30.793
Stay still.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.597
So, it was an emergency.

16:34.599 --> 16:37.733
That clears you of working over
the regulated shift limit. Good.

16:37.735 --> 16:41.370
And that's why you walked out
of the operating room.

16:41.372 --> 16:43.238
Fatigue?

16:43.240 --> 16:44.907
Charlie?

16:44.909 --> 16:46.609
He lied to me.

16:46.611 --> 16:51.513
He kept talking about getting to work,

16:51.515 --> 16:53.983
like it was the only thing
he had to worry about.

16:53.985 --> 16:55.651
I'm telling you, man, it's wrecked.

16:55.653 --> 16:56.986
I thought I told you to stay put.

16:56.988 --> 16:58.520
That's the thing about me...
I don't stay still.

16:58.522 --> 17:00.255
Not for long, anyway.

17:00.257 --> 17:02.291
Who did you say was driving?

17:14.003 --> 17:16.070
Is that me?

17:16.073 --> 17:19.241
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:19.242 --> 17:22.478
You found him at the side
of the road or in the car?

17:22.480 --> 17:25.814
Uh, I'm sorry,
I must have mixed that up.

17:25.816 --> 17:27.348
Mm-hmm. I...

17:27.351 --> 17:29.385
Um...

17:29.387 --> 17:31.320
Yeah.

17:31.322 --> 17:32.921
It was one of them.

17:32.923 --> 17:34.923
One of who?

17:35.992 --> 17:37.026
A ghost.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.383
Hi.

17:48.385 --> 17:50.518
I'm Dr. Shahir Hamza,

17:50.520 --> 17:53.154
and I'm here to tell you
a little bit about my me.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.991
Myself... about my me! Get it?

17:55.993 --> 17:58.727
I can't. Damn it!
Dana, this is not working.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.929
Of course you can. Look at it this way.

18:00.931 --> 18:03.365
You can fumble your way
through another interview,

18:03.367 --> 18:05.934
telling them about the time you
got a piece of cerebral cortex

18:05.936 --> 18:08.370
- in your mouth...
- It wasn't <i>in</i> my mouth.

18:08.372 --> 18:09.971
- You just got to relax.
- You can just...

18:09.973 --> 18:12.707
- Yeah, act like we're not here.
- Yeah.

18:12.709 --> 18:14.309
Just try to act cool.

18:14.311 --> 18:15.543
- Loosen up. Cool.
- Yeah. - Yes, yes.

18:15.545 --> 18:16.912
- Chill. - Cool, chill.
- That's it!

18:16.914 --> 18:18.113
- Yeah.
- That's it. You know?

18:18.115 --> 18:19.581
I can act cool.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.116
Okay.

18:22.752 --> 18:23.752
Hey.

18:23.754 --> 18:24.753
Oh!

18:24.755 --> 18:25.954
Oh! Oh, my gosh. No!

18:25.956 --> 18:27.088
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Don't look, don't look.

18:27.090 --> 18:28.990
Dana, I can't do this.
I can't, I can't.

18:28.992 --> 18:30.258
Yes, of course you can.

18:30.260 --> 18:32.494
- We're gonna try it one more time.
- Oh.

18:32.496 --> 18:34.729
- What is this?
- Dad?

18:34.731 --> 18:36.431
What the hell's going on?

18:36.433 --> 18:37.966
Uh... Oh!

18:37.968 --> 18:39.234
Uh, gosh, you must be...

18:39.236 --> 18:40.635
Their father, that's right.

18:40.637 --> 18:41.636
Hmm.

18:41.638 --> 18:43.471
And I would love an explanation.

18:43.473 --> 18:47.042
Oh, I remember the first time
I got punched in the face.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.277
Why am I not surprised
it's more than one?

18:49.279 --> 18:50.745
Ho ho.

18:50.747 --> 18:53.682
Anyway, chicks dig scars, bro.

18:53.684 --> 18:56.651
Maybe Cassie will go once more
into your britches.

18:56.653 --> 18:58.253
You need serious help.

18:58.255 --> 19:00.922
I do not know how you lasted
as long as you did with her.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.193
You like her, huh?

19:05.195 --> 19:07.495
Come on, I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:07.497 --> 19:10.966
The old schoolyard bully thing,
it's a little obvious.

19:10.968 --> 19:12.534
Would you be cool if I asked her out?

19:12.536 --> 19:14.369
Honestly, I'd pay to see that.

19:14.371 --> 19:15.837
I think she digs me, too.

19:15.839 --> 19:17.706
You done?

19:17.708 --> 19:21.676
Uh, all stitched up and ready
to get back on the horse, boss.

19:21.678 --> 19:23.478
Are you gonna press charges?

19:23.480 --> 19:26.014
Dr. Miller said this would
happen sooner or later.

19:26.016 --> 19:27.649
Price of doing business.

19:27.651 --> 19:30.051
Hey, so, uh, did you figure out
what's wrong with this guy?

19:30.053 --> 19:31.753
Something is definitely off.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.689
You know, he takes light bulbs
and smashes them onto himself

19:34.691 --> 19:36.024
during his wrestling matches?

19:36.026 --> 19:37.859
Wait, wait, like florescent ones?

19:37.861 --> 19:39.728
- Yeah.
- Those things are toxic, man.

19:39.730 --> 19:42.030
Yeah, they have a whole whack
of chemicals inside of them.

19:42.032 --> 19:43.965
You know, the test I ran
was limited to narcotics

19:43.967 --> 19:47.635
and infections, so I need to
widen the parameters.

19:47.637 --> 19:49.304
Our lives have been brought together.

19:49.306 --> 19:51.306
I mean, I really think that
we are going to experience

19:51.308 --> 19:53.541
something so profound today.

19:53.543 --> 19:55.410
Or get fired in the process.

19:55.412 --> 19:57.479
When you wrote that article
on the usage of hematite

19:57.481 --> 19:59.014
- for your doorway elves?
- Yeah.

19:59.016 --> 20:00.849
Roxy, focus.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.717
Right, okay.

20:02.719 --> 20:05.420
I found a case study
from a hospital in Atlanta.

20:05.422 --> 20:07.088
They reduced a strangulated hernia

20:07.090 --> 20:08.590
in a very similar location

20:08.592 --> 20:10.191
without the use of general anesthetics.

20:10.193 --> 20:12.293
General anesthetic
has three components...

20:12.295 --> 20:14.262
an antianxiety drug, a muscle relaxant,

20:14.264 --> 20:15.530
and a sleeping agent.

20:15.532 --> 20:17.732
And Roxy is willing to take
the Propofol from the mix,

20:17.734 --> 20:19.167
if that's a deal breaker.

20:19.169 --> 20:22.504
Which it is, but I also want you
to remove the muscle relaxant.

20:22.506 --> 20:23.938
No, that's not a good idea.

20:23.940 --> 20:26.274
I can control my breathing
and my muscles.

20:26.276 --> 20:29.244
Look, I told you.
I need to be in full control.

20:29.246 --> 20:31.312
So do we, Layla, as much as possible.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.981
And without a relaxant,
your muscles could twitch.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.749
If I have a scalpel in my hand
at the time, it...

20:34.751 --> 20:36.217
We would be talking minutes

20:36.219 --> 20:37.719
until I could put you under to fix it.

20:37.721 --> 20:39.788
It's not even going to happen,
so what are you worrying about?

20:39.790 --> 20:42.223
You know your mantra about
your past being behind you,

20:42.225 --> 20:43.558
so let it go?

20:43.560 --> 20:45.226
Yeah.

20:45.228 --> 20:47.328
It's helping a lot of people.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.863
What about you?

20:48.865 --> 20:50.899
This is how I want to help you, okay?

20:50.901 --> 20:53.568
I'm gonna freeze you.
We're gonna give you a local.

20:53.570 --> 20:55.336
Then Roxy is going to
give you an epidural

20:55.338 --> 20:57.038
to take care of the midline incision.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.873
One-two punch.

20:59.909 --> 21:01.709
Okay.

21:02.778 --> 21:05.613
This is a one-shot deal.
I can only give you 60 CCs.

21:05.615 --> 21:08.183
Whatever you got to do
to keep me conscious, okay?

21:08.185 --> 21:09.818
And part of the decision making.

21:09.820 --> 21:11.653
We'll take this one step at a time.

21:11.655 --> 21:13.388
But you are gonna have to trust me.

21:13.390 --> 21:16.758
Now, when we are on the bowel,
you will feel some discomfort.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.394
That's okay. I'll take over from there.

21:19.396 --> 21:22.063
Okay, we'll ride this out together.

21:22.065 --> 21:23.832
So, we have a plan.

21:23.834 --> 21:26.234
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

21:26.236 --> 21:28.002
So, what are we waiting for?

21:28.004 --> 21:32.073
I'm not coming to this blind,
Charlie. I read your chart.

21:32.075 --> 21:34.342
Gavin Murphy, your last psychiatrist,

21:34.344 --> 21:36.878
he thought you could
manage your visions.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.980
But you're having troubles, aren't you,

21:38.982 --> 21:40.548
separating them from reality?

21:40.550 --> 21:42.317
Now, Charlie...

21:44.588 --> 21:45.720
I'm done with this.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.389
Please, Charlie. Sit down, please.

22:15.818 --> 22:18.153
You hear about that cat in Squamish?

22:18.155 --> 22:19.387
No.

22:19.389 --> 22:20.922
It was in the news.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.191
The therapy cat at the old folk's home?

22:23.193 --> 22:25.960
Yeah, they said it had this gift.

22:25.962 --> 22:27.695
Whenever someone was about to die,

22:27.697 --> 22:30.098
without fail,
it would curl up with them.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.834
So they knew if that thing
showed you any love,

22:32.836 --> 22:34.335
that was it, man.

22:34.337 --> 22:36.971
You're done for.

22:36.973 --> 22:39.641
I guess the question is,

22:39.643 --> 22:44.179
did the cat know who was gonna
live and who was gonna die,

22:44.181 --> 22:47.782
or was it the one
who was deciding all along?

22:54.223 --> 22:56.624
And we are good to go.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.226
Everyone ready?

22:58.228 --> 22:59.494
Yeah.

22:59.496 --> 23:01.029
Scalpel.

23:02.732 --> 23:04.132
Layla, you all right?

23:04.134 --> 23:05.366
I'm scared.

23:05.368 --> 23:07.135
I'm here.

23:08.337 --> 23:10.171
Dr. Reid?

23:11.907 --> 23:14.275
Is everything okay up there?

23:14.277 --> 23:16.311
Never better.

23:16.313 --> 23:18.246
All right, you're gonna feel
some pressure.

23:24.688 --> 23:26.120
You all right?

23:26.122 --> 23:27.922
I'm good.

23:27.924 --> 23:29.891
Keep going.

23:42.738 --> 23:44.105
Oh, no.

23:44.107 --> 23:45.306
Oh, no, no.

23:45.308 --> 23:46.641
Talk to me. Tell me what happened.

23:46.643 --> 23:48.109
That can't be me, man. What is this?

23:48.111 --> 23:50.078
Hey! The accident...
what do you remember?

23:50.080 --> 23:52.080
I don't know. There was a cat.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.982
- A cat? What cat?
- The frigging cat, man.

23:53.984 --> 23:56.584
A cat ran out in front of me.
What do you mean, what cat?

23:56.586 --> 23:58.553
I have to get to work.

24:02.091 --> 24:05.693
This isn't a good idea.

24:07.229 --> 24:10.932
So, if someone should see you
like this, it's...

24:10.934 --> 24:13.768
I needed more time.

24:13.770 --> 24:17.472
- Come on, Charlie.
- Let's... Let's keep going.

24:17.474 --> 24:18.806
Come on.

24:22.820 --> 24:24.671
How is she, Roxy?

24:24.673 --> 24:25.939
She's great, actually.

24:25.941 --> 24:28.008
Heart rate stable,
blood pressure steady.

24:28.010 --> 24:29.977
What do you charge for that seminar?

24:29.979 --> 24:31.511
Mm.

24:31.513 --> 24:34.314
Get me out of here in one piece,
I'll cut you a monster deal.

24:34.316 --> 24:36.984
You get through this, it's on me.

24:36.986 --> 24:39.252
Okay, Layla,
I've come across a scar tissue

24:39.254 --> 24:40.454
from your previous surgery.

24:40.456 --> 24:43.123
I'm gonna have to manually reduce it.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.825
There will be more pain.

24:44.827 --> 24:46.259
Do it.

24:50.965 --> 24:52.866
Okay, we can't keep doing this.
You're moving too much.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.434
- Distract me.
- What?

24:54.436 --> 24:56.003
Talk to me, please. It'll help.

24:56.005 --> 24:58.672
Why did you come this morning?

25:00.342 --> 25:02.542
Come on, you got to talk to me.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.812
Okay, if you must know, my life
has been falling apart lately.

25:05.814 --> 25:07.914
- Why? What's missing?
- What?

25:07.916 --> 25:11.318
You said lately, which means you
had something and now it's gone.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.020
My mother passed away.

25:14.623 --> 25:16.690
Ohh!

25:19.495 --> 25:21.361
You got to keep talking to me, please.

25:21.363 --> 25:24.831
Okay, and there's also my fiancé
or e-ex.

25:24.833 --> 25:26.533
- He, uh...
- Left?

25:26.535 --> 25:28.135
Not really. No, you know what?

25:28.137 --> 25:30.203
I... This is just... This is too weird.

25:30.205 --> 25:31.938
How do you think I feel?
Come on, please.

25:31.940 --> 25:35.142
Please keep talking.
It's help... It's helping.

25:36.878 --> 25:38.979
Okay, so you left.

25:38.981 --> 25:41.181
And now you're wondering
if you made the right decision.

25:41.183 --> 25:42.282
Aah!

25:43.318 --> 25:44.651
All right, there we have it, okay?

25:44.653 --> 25:46.486
I'm through the scar tissue.

25:46.488 --> 25:49.689
Do you love him?

25:49.691 --> 25:51.158
We have to stop.

25:51.160 --> 25:52.993
No. No, no, this is working.

25:52.995 --> 25:54.327
Keep going.

25:54.329 --> 25:55.796
No, Layla.

25:55.798 --> 25:58.265
The bowel has lost blood supply.
It's necrotic.

25:58.267 --> 25:59.566
What does that even mean?

25:59.568 --> 26:02.035
It means I don't have a choice anymore.

26:02.037 --> 26:03.437
I have to put you under.

26:03.439 --> 26:04.971
What if you don't?

26:04.973 --> 26:06.506
Then you'll die.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.545
His liver just needs time.

26:11.547 --> 26:13.346
I mean, we're keeping him here
as a precaution,

26:13.348 --> 26:15.015
but, uh, it should heal itself.

26:15.017 --> 26:17.217
Yeah, unless you're parading him
around, shooting something...

26:17.219 --> 26:19.086
What is that, a dating profile?

26:19.088 --> 26:20.754
No, no, not at all. I mean, that...

26:20.756 --> 26:22.355
Well, what is it? What are you doing?

26:24.526 --> 26:26.059
Never mind.

26:26.061 --> 26:28.195
You're right.

26:28.197 --> 26:30.997
It was inappropriate, and I apologize.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.067
All right.

26:34.069 --> 26:36.269
Sorry, I had a bad day.

26:36.271 --> 26:38.371
No, it was...

26:39.908 --> 26:42.876
Well, those are passionate kids
you've got.

26:42.878 --> 26:44.544
- Yes.
- They get that from you?

26:44.546 --> 26:46.346
No. That's their mom.

26:46.348 --> 26:47.814
I'm more...

26:47.816 --> 26:49.382
- Pragmatist?
- Yes.

26:49.384 --> 26:50.784
- Somebody's got to be.
- Right?

26:50.786 --> 26:51.818
Yeah.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.587
Although...

26:53.589 --> 26:55.655
seems like the only time
I'm spending with them lately

26:55.657 --> 26:57.157
is just driving them someplace

26:57.159 --> 26:59.326
or busting their chops
for not doing chores.

26:59.328 --> 27:02.529
But they admire you. You know that.

27:02.531 --> 27:04.798
Yeah, when they're not afraid of me.

27:06.234 --> 27:09.636
You know, at the, uh... at the
risk of stepping over the line,

27:09.638 --> 27:12.506
can I offer a little advice,
pragmatist to pragmatist?

27:12.508 --> 27:13.507
Sure.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.208
Support their thing.

27:15.210 --> 27:16.810
You don't know how lucky you are

27:16.812 --> 27:18.845
to have kids with drive like that.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.447
Yeah, they're pretty into it, right?

27:20.449 --> 27:22.349
Some people spend their entire lives

27:22.351 --> 27:23.617
searching for that kind of passion.

27:23.619 --> 27:24.885
- All right.
- Mm.

27:24.887 --> 27:26.953
If you assure me
Dom's liver can take it,

27:26.955 --> 27:28.822
then you can go ahead
and finish your whatev...

27:28.824 --> 27:30.157
- Oh.
- Yeah.

27:30.159 --> 27:31.258
- Wait.
- Well...

27:31.260 --> 27:32.559
What are you shooting?

27:34.296 --> 27:35.762
Really, it's a long story.

27:41.536 --> 27:42.969
So...

27:42.971 --> 27:46.473
the good news is Dr. Sekara
will not be pressing charges.

27:46.475 --> 27:47.774
What's the bad news?

27:47.776 --> 27:49.943
You have to stop smashing
light bulbs during your matches.

27:49.945 --> 27:51.211
Well, that's part of my gimmick.

27:51.213 --> 27:52.479
Jake, listen to me.

27:52.481 --> 27:54.347
Smashing these light bulbs
against your skin

27:54.349 --> 27:57.017
is releasing trace amounts of
mercury into your bloodstream.

27:57.019 --> 27:58.985
It's what's causing
your violent mood swings.

27:58.987 --> 28:01.454
I have mercury poisoning.

28:01.456 --> 28:04.791
Luckily, the mercury should
flush itself out naturally,

28:04.793 --> 28:07.194
and any sensory issues
you're having should stop.

28:07.196 --> 28:09.529
And I'll be fine then?

28:09.531 --> 28:12.465
I'd like to see you next week
just to check on your levels,

28:12.467 --> 28:13.466
but, yeah.

28:13.468 --> 28:15.335
You want to see me again.

28:17.306 --> 28:20.173
Me or... the attending on call.

28:20.175 --> 28:22.008
So I'll see you around.

28:22.010 --> 28:23.310
Stop, wait.

28:23.312 --> 28:25.712
- I want to say thank you.
- It's not necessary.

28:25.714 --> 28:27.314
I-I know it's not, but I just...

28:28.951 --> 28:30.450
I'm sorry.

28:30.452 --> 28:33.320
Uh... th-the mercury.

28:33.322 --> 28:35.455
Goodbye, Mr. Bugle.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.996
Get out of the way! This
patient's on the brink of death!

28:42.998 --> 28:45.165
- Move! Move!
- Wait! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

28:45.167 --> 28:46.866
- Huh?
- Shahir.

28:46.868 --> 28:48.068
Yes?

28:48.070 --> 28:49.769
- You have to stop smiling.
- Huh?

28:49.771 --> 28:51.271
It's supposed to be serious.

28:51.273 --> 28:54.341
No, not like that.
Just a... Just do your normal.

28:54.343 --> 28:56.209
- Just your regular face.
- Like this?

28:56.211 --> 28:57.477
- This is normal.
- Yeah, just like that.

28:57.479 --> 28:58.545
- Exactly, just like...
- Iris?

28:58.547 --> 29:00.513
Take it easy, take it easy.

29:00.515 --> 29:01.948
It's okay.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.149
Come up close to the wall here.

29:03.151 --> 29:04.718
Yeah, come lean against the wall.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.152
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

29:06.154 --> 29:08.088
Honey, can you tell me
what's happening?

29:08.090 --> 29:09.422
Kind of dizzy.

29:09.424 --> 29:10.790
- Uh-huh.
- All right, just look straight ahead.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.559
Okay.

29:12.561 --> 29:15.262
No. No. You promised me.

29:15.264 --> 29:16.830
That was before.

29:16.832 --> 29:18.298
Now we need enough exposure

29:18.300 --> 29:20.066
to evaluate the extent of the necrosis.

29:20.068 --> 29:21.668
I can't do that
without putting you under.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.036
Her pulse is skyrocketing.

29:23.038 --> 29:24.471
Dr. Reid, what do you want us to do?

29:24.473 --> 29:25.939
Call it off. You got to call it off.

29:25.941 --> 29:28.375
Okay, okay. No, don't... Get off me!

29:28.377 --> 29:30.944
Okay. Okay.

29:30.946 --> 29:33.213
Look, I understand that
this is hard for you,

29:33.215 --> 29:36.349
but if you don't let me take
care of this, you will die.

29:36.351 --> 29:38.385
I can't.

29:38.387 --> 29:40.287
Don't ask me to.

29:40.289 --> 29:42.088
Layla, let me fix this.

29:42.090 --> 29:44.257
No, I can't do it.

29:44.259 --> 29:46.092
I won't give up my power.

29:46.094 --> 29:48.495
There is power in this...

29:48.497 --> 29:52.098
a decision right here, right now.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.301
You let go of what happened to you.

29:54.303 --> 29:57.137
You choose what happens next.

29:59.875 --> 30:02.175
You and I, we can do this together.

30:02.177 --> 30:04.778
We have more than enough fire,
like you said.

30:04.780 --> 30:06.546
We just have to trust each other.

30:07.648 --> 30:10.684
Don't leave me alone.

30:10.686 --> 30:11.851
I won't leave you.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.721
I will be here every step of the way.

30:14.723 --> 30:16.956
Layla, we are running out of time.

30:16.958 --> 30:18.325
Please.

30:18.327 --> 30:20.327
Don't let this beat you.

30:21.295 --> 30:22.696
Okay.

30:24.298 --> 30:25.932
Okay.

30:28.936 --> 30:30.403
Roxy?

30:36.453 --> 30:38.486
I was worried about Dom.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.288
I guess I didn't remember
hitting my head.

30:40.290 --> 30:42.991
We assessed her,
but he was our clear priority.

30:42.993 --> 30:44.392
Her mother's gonna kill me.

30:44.394 --> 30:46.628
I have good news.

30:46.630 --> 30:48.797
You're leaking cerebral spinal fluid.

30:48.799 --> 30:51.433
- What?
- No, it's okay. It's minor.

30:51.435 --> 30:53.701
Like I said, good news.

30:55.838 --> 30:57.172
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:57.174 --> 30:58.673
She's afraid of needles.

30:58.675 --> 31:01.309
Oh, but we're just gonna drain
some of the excess fluid,

31:01.311 --> 31:03.278
- and then we can get right back to filming.
- Get that away from me!

31:03.280 --> 31:04.712
Iris, it's gonna be okay.

31:04.714 --> 31:06.448
No, it's not okay, Dad.

31:06.450 --> 31:09.117
All right, everyone.
Let's just take a deep breath.

31:11.421 --> 31:15.323
Iris... can you wiggle your toes for me?

31:15.325 --> 31:17.759
Right. Let's check motor function.

31:17.761 --> 31:19.427
Yes. Mm-hmm.

31:19.429 --> 31:21.496
- Guess I'm all good.
- Mm.

31:21.498 --> 31:22.964
Actually, you know what, Dr. Kinney?

31:22.966 --> 31:25.233
I do need to check the patient's spine.

31:25.235 --> 31:27.001
Of course. Iris, would you mind

31:27.003 --> 31:29.637
lying on your side so he can
take a look at your spine?

31:29.639 --> 31:32.006
Let's get you right up here
beside your dad.

31:32.008 --> 31:33.308
Very slowly.

31:33.310 --> 31:35.376
Careful.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.681
- There we go.
- Okay.

31:39.683 --> 31:43.785
I'm just going to check
the bone density in your spine.

31:43.787 --> 31:46.488
You know I've never seen
the movie "Evil Dead"?

31:46.490 --> 31:48.022
Are you serious?

31:48.024 --> 31:50.492
Not a fan of zombies.
They don't have brains.

31:50.494 --> 31:52.894
They're not zombies.
They're "Deadites."

31:52.896 --> 31:54.829
Oh. What's the difference?

31:54.831 --> 31:56.197
Zombies are dumb.

31:56.199 --> 31:57.866
They just shuffle around
all slow and stupid.

31:57.868 --> 31:59.400
And Deadites aren't like that?

31:59.402 --> 32:00.969
No! No way.

32:00.971 --> 32:03.204
They're smarter,
and they play tricks and...

32:03.206 --> 32:05.507
Ow! What was that?

32:05.509 --> 32:08.376
That's a trick.
At least my version of one.

32:08.378 --> 32:10.311
Okay, that's the procedure.
You're all done.

32:10.313 --> 32:12.213
You just stabbed me in the back?

32:12.215 --> 32:13.481
No...

32:13.483 --> 32:16.384
Well, technically, yes. Yes, I did.

32:16.386 --> 32:18.086
But I drained some of the excess fluid.

32:18.088 --> 32:19.888
We're gonna keep you monitored
just for a bit,

32:19.890 --> 32:22.290
but I think you're gonna be just fine.

32:28.664 --> 32:30.398
Layla? Layla, it's okay.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.466
I'm here. I got you.

32:31.468 --> 32:33.635
Oh, Alex.

32:33.637 --> 32:35.103
It's done?

32:35.105 --> 32:38.039
We're good. It's over.

32:40.277 --> 32:41.876
You did this.

32:43.979 --> 32:46.147
And you're safe.

32:46.149 --> 32:48.349
Oh, thank you.

32:48.351 --> 32:50.385
You're okay.

32:53.990 --> 32:55.790
You're treating this accident

32:55.792 --> 32:58.092
like it's not something
that happens all the time.

32:58.094 --> 33:00.161
How often do you treat drunk drivers?

33:00.163 --> 33:02.530
What, daily? So why the rage?

33:02.532 --> 33:04.299
What is it about him specifically?

33:04.301 --> 33:05.767
Because he lied to me!

33:05.769 --> 33:07.769
You couldn't tell the man
from the spirit,

33:07.771 --> 33:08.903
and that's upsetting.

33:08.905 --> 33:11.172
No, it wasn't...

33:11.174 --> 33:12.440
It was my fault.

33:12.442 --> 33:14.742
You have to know that is not true.

33:14.744 --> 33:16.578
You don't understand! You're not
listening to me! You're not...

33:16.580 --> 33:18.780
Because you're not telling the truth.

33:18.782 --> 33:21.216
What really happened, Charlie?

33:36.098 --> 33:38.032
Hey!

33:39.235 --> 33:41.035
What was this about a cat?

33:42.605 --> 33:44.539
What happened to the cat?

34:05.628 --> 34:08.029
Okay. I give.

34:08.031 --> 34:09.931
What are we doing?

34:30.018 --> 34:32.954
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:32.956 --> 34:35.089
No, no, no. No.

34:35.091 --> 34:36.157
No!

34:36.159 --> 34:37.824
Help!

34:37.827 --> 34:39.427
He has no pulse!

34:40.663 --> 34:42.697
No. No.

34:57.479 --> 34:59.614
I wasted time.

34:59.616 --> 35:01.449
If I had just gotten there sooner,

35:01.451 --> 35:03.718
if he hadn't held me up...

35:03.720 --> 35:05.853
You are losing control.

35:05.855 --> 35:08.823
You've got to shut it down. Stop it.

35:08.825 --> 35:09.957
I can't.

35:09.959 --> 35:11.159
Maybe you can.

35:11.161 --> 35:12.527
What are you talking about?

35:12.529 --> 35:14.529
You couldn't save him

35:14.531 --> 35:17.098
because you didn't have enough time...

35:17.100 --> 35:18.900
because you were talking to them.

35:18.902 --> 35:20.968
And what if it happens again?

35:20.970 --> 35:23.504
What if, next time, it's Luke?

35:23.506 --> 35:25.239
I'm not gonna let that happen.

35:25.241 --> 35:26.641
Oh, no? What are you gonna do about it?

35:26.643 --> 35:28.876
I'll stop it if I can.

35:28.878 --> 35:30.078
I'm here to help.

35:30.080 --> 35:33.081
I'm here to put things back
the way they should be.

35:33.083 --> 35:35.116
What do you...
You think I want to see them?

35:35.118 --> 35:38.720
Do you think I... Do you think
I w... I want any of this?

35:38.722 --> 35:40.188
I can fix it. I can.

35:40.190 --> 35:44.559
But first you have to trust me
before it takes them all...

35:44.561 --> 35:47.695
Luke, Alex...

35:47.697 --> 35:49.397
the new baby.

35:55.270 --> 35:56.971
I can't... I can't get away.

35:56.973 --> 35:58.139
They're...

35:58.141 --> 35:59.507
They're everywhere.

35:59.509 --> 36:01.376
They're everywhere!

36:01.378 --> 36:02.543
They're...

36:02.545 --> 36:04.145
Charlie.

36:12.988 --> 36:14.622
Charlie.

36:23.999 --> 36:25.833
I should've been there.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.402
I should've...

36:27.404 --> 36:28.536
Okay.

36:28.538 --> 36:29.670
I should've...

36:29.672 --> 36:30.872
Okay.

36:30.874 --> 36:32.573
Okay, come here. Come here.

36:32.575 --> 36:34.976
I got you. I got you.

36:34.978 --> 36:36.978
Shh.

36:39.646 --> 36:42.514
Hibiscus mint. No caffeine.

36:42.516 --> 36:43.648
Thank you.

36:43.650 --> 36:45.684
I wanted to see how you were doing,

36:45.686 --> 36:47.619
check and see how those staples
are healing.

36:47.621 --> 36:49.521
That just an excuse to see me?

36:51.023 --> 36:52.257
I really do believe

36:52.259 --> 36:54.793
people come into each other's
lives for a reason.

36:54.795 --> 36:58.497
And I think that yours
was to help me through this.

36:58.499 --> 37:00.198
Thank you.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.634
It's my job.

37:02.636 --> 37:06.471
No, your job is to cut people up
and take out their disease.

37:06.473 --> 37:08.907
You went above and beyond and...

37:10.243 --> 37:12.944
I would really like to do
the same thing for you,

37:12.946 --> 37:15.747
maybe help you move through

37:15.749 --> 37:18.116
whatever past you're running from.

37:18.118 --> 37:21.052
You did a great thing for me today.

37:23.556 --> 37:27.125
I'd like to balance the scales,
if possible.

37:28.494 --> 37:30.195
I'm handling it.

37:30.197 --> 37:33.098
This doesn't look like
handling it to me.

37:35.235 --> 37:36.968
I have to talk to the family.

37:36.970 --> 37:38.837
Not like this.

37:40.573 --> 37:42.474
Go home.

37:42.476 --> 37:44.209
Get some rest.

37:44.211 --> 37:46.011
I'll take care of it.

37:57.991 --> 38:00.058
And... lights.

38:03.930 --> 38:07.132
<i>When he told me
he wanted to adopt,</i>

38:07.134 --> 38:09.935
<i>I never questioned
that Shahir would be a father.</i>

38:09.937 --> 38:12.137
<i>That's not to say
he doesn't face challenges...</i>

38:12.139 --> 38:14.839
<i>difficulty communicating,
forming relationships.</i>

38:14.841 --> 38:17.142
<i>These are the things
they teach us at medical school</i>

38:17.144 --> 38:19.311
<i>when we study autism.</i>

38:19.313 --> 38:21.680
<i>But we all struggle
with connection...</i>

38:21.682 --> 38:25.850
<i>fathers and sons, friends,
students, family members.</i>

38:25.852 --> 38:27.852
<i>Shahir might have to
fight twice as hard</i>

38:27.854 --> 38:29.487
<i>to connect with the people
in his life,</i>

38:29.489 --> 38:31.523
<i>but he does it
without complaint.</i>

38:31.525 --> 38:34.526
<i>He does it honestly, with
the needs of others in mind,</i>

38:34.528 --> 38:37.095
<i>and his patients
adore him for it.</i>

38:37.097 --> 38:39.331
<i>That's why I know
he'll be a great father,</i>

38:39.333 --> 38:41.166
<i>because he's a great man.</i>

38:41.168 --> 38:43.702
<i>Asking whether or not</i>

38:43.704 --> 38:46.705
<i>Shahir Hamza should be given
the chance to be a father</i>

38:46.707 --> 38:48.907
<i>is simply the wrong question.</i>

38:48.909 --> 38:50.675
<i>The one you should be asking is,</i>

38:50.677 --> 38:53.878
<i>"Who's the kid out there lucky
enough to get him for a dad?"</i>

38:53.880 --> 38:57.182
You missed the standing ovation
in there.

38:57.184 --> 38:59.184
Ah.

39:01.854 --> 39:04.022
Is something on your mind?

39:05.191 --> 39:08.193
So many passionate people today.

39:08.195 --> 39:11.296
Shahir and your kids

39:11.298 --> 39:14.866
just, you know,
fighting for what they want,

39:14.868 --> 39:17.736
knowing they want it
with every fiber of their being,

39:17.738 --> 39:23.708
and it... it makes me question
what that might be for me.

39:23.710 --> 39:25.043
Right.

39:25.045 --> 39:26.278
Midlife crisis.

39:27.848 --> 39:30.315
Something like that, yeah. Yeah.

39:30.317 --> 39:35.553
So I spent this last year
chasing after a new specialty,

39:35.555 --> 39:38.390
thinking that was what I wanted.

39:38.392 --> 39:40.091
But now that I have it...

39:40.093 --> 39:41.493
There's still something missing.

39:41.495 --> 39:42.861
Yeah.

39:42.863 --> 39:45.263
- I bombed my pitches today.
- What?

39:45.265 --> 39:47.532
Yeah, if I didn't get the call
the kids were in the hospital,

39:47.534 --> 39:49.334
- I'd have been laughed out of the building.
- Aw.

39:49.336 --> 39:50.468
Wasn't good.

39:50.470 --> 39:52.604
But you captured something in there.

39:52.606 --> 39:54.205
- Seriously.
- Oh.

39:54.207 --> 39:57.342
You've got s-something.
I don't know. An ease or...

39:57.344 --> 39:59.144
And the camera adores you.

39:59.146 --> 40:01.046
Oh, now you're just
busting <i>my</i> chops.

40:01.048 --> 40:03.114
- I'm really not.
- Come on.

40:03.116 --> 40:04.461
Listen, I've had this idea

40:04.462 --> 40:05.426
- for quite some time.
- Mm-hmm.

40:05.427 --> 40:06.703
Uh, it's...

40:06.854 --> 40:09.119
- it's a medical show geared towards women.
- Mm.

40:09.122 --> 40:11.289
But I've never been able
to find the right host.

40:11.291 --> 40:14.826
Oh, you...

40:16.862 --> 40:19.230
- You're not serious.
- I am.

40:19.232 --> 40:20.765
You want to grab some dinner
and talk about it?

40:20.767 --> 40:22.467
Okay.

40:23.469 --> 40:25.670
Oh, and, obviously, it's not, you know,

40:25.672 --> 40:27.605
some weird "casting couch"
kind of thing.

40:29.141 --> 40:31.142
Oh, too bad.

42:09.776 --> 42:11.209
