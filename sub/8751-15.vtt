WEBVTT

00:06.481 --> 00:08.985
It's been here forever.

00:08.986 --> 00:11.886
It's making them crazy.

00:11.887 --> 00:14.745
I'm scared of the woods.

00:14.746 --> 00:16.824
She's seeing monsters.

00:16.825 --> 00:19.136
They can get in the house.

00:19.137 --> 00:21.612
It's very concerning.

00:21.613 --> 00:24.935
I walked into a black mass.

00:24.936 --> 00:26.125
Satanic.

00:26.126 --> 00:29.728
Then they killed the
mother and the father.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.829
So bad.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.590
Secrets are buried deep here.

00:37.589 --> 00:39.829
They're being watched.

00:39.830 --> 00:42.737
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.988
This thing likes death.

00:44.989 --> 00:46.771
I see dead people.

00:46.772 --> 00:48.339
This thing is, like, a monster.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.409
I speak to dead people.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.099
And he's pissed off now.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.608
And they speak to me.

00:53.609 --> 00:55.204
His head was cracked.

00:55.205 --> 00:58.184
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.185 --> 01:00.234
This guy was murdered.

01:00.235 --> 01:01.653
I rely on my partner.

01:01.654 --> 01:05.007
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:05.009 --> 01:07.726
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:07.727 --> 01:10.819
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.732
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.733 --> 01:14.885
Why would you stay here?

01:14.886 --> 01:17.009
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.010 --> 01:18.993
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.994 --> 01:20.405
Until the very end.

01:20.406 --> 01:22.179
Stop it.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.343
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.344 --> 01:26.749
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.104
Or time to get out.

01:28.105 --> 01:32.845
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

01:51.041 --> 01:54.210
Amy and I have handled
dozens of cases together,

01:54.211 --> 01:57.513
and we always follow one key rule...

01:57.514 --> 02:01.148
We don't discuss our
findings until the very end.

02:01.149 --> 02:04.753
I interview witnesses and uncover
the property's dark secrets,

02:04.754 --> 02:07.957
while Amy communicates with the dead.

02:07.958 --> 02:11.619
I'm in northern Indiana in
the small town of Wabash.

02:11.620 --> 02:16.765
Amy and I were called in by a mother of
three who sounded very upset on the phone.

02:16.766 --> 02:19.068
She says she has violent
spirits in the house

02:19.069 --> 02:21.603
and that the spirits are
targeting her children.

02:21.604 --> 02:26.704
I'm hoping Amy and I can
give her some answers.

02:35.853 --> 02:38.154
Before Amy arrives, I
clear the area of anything

02:38.155 --> 02:42.055
that could influence her findings.

02:42.292 --> 02:45.394
This house has a lot of
photographs and children's toys,

02:45.395 --> 02:48.097
so I need to be careful to
remove any leading evidence

02:48.098 --> 02:53.018
about the family living
here before she begins.

03:13.757 --> 03:17.177
There is a doorway here...

03:17.494 --> 03:20.674
For... for dead people.

03:21.064 --> 03:26.404
But I opened it, and it
was, like, endless darkness.

03:27.070 --> 03:29.438
And it's a darkness...

03:29.439 --> 03:32.979
That's layers of depression.

03:33.676 --> 03:36.930
These dark, black hands...

03:36.931 --> 03:39.982
Came out to grab me.

03:39.983 --> 03:43.883
And it wanted to wrap me in it.

03:53.397 --> 03:56.957
So, Suzanne, when I spoke to you on
the phone, you sounded very upset.

03:56.958 --> 03:59.701
So, now that I'm here, why don't
you explain what's going on?

03:59.702 --> 04:03.084
Well, we've been having a
lot of experiences here...

04:03.085 --> 04:06.971
Um myself, my husband, my three kids.

04:06.972 --> 04:11.412
Okay. Like what? Give me a for instance.

04:14.186 --> 04:17.305
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

04:17.432 --> 04:19.255
It really gets down deep.

04:19.255 --> 04:24.956
All right. Why don't you
tell me about what's going on?

04:26.029 --> 04:29.265
Lots of stuff out of
the corner of your eye.

04:29.266 --> 04:32.053
We've seen an apparition.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.814
Footsteps, voices.

04:38.375 --> 04:42.783
I just don't want my children
to be scared of their own house.

04:42.784 --> 04:44.704
Okay.

04:44.848 --> 04:46.930
And they are.

04:46.931 --> 04:49.986
I don't know how to make it better.

04:49.987 --> 04:54.829
I want them to be comfortable
here in their own home.

04:54.830 --> 04:56.812
I don't think there's
a rule book on this.

04:56.813 --> 04:58.613
No.

04:59.796 --> 05:01.444
And how long have you been living here?

05:01.445 --> 05:04.265
About seven years.

05:04.334 --> 05:09.012
My husband's family has owned
it for three generations.

05:09.013 --> 05:11.811
Okay, so, do you know any
of the history of the house?

05:11.812 --> 05:16.462
I know that the house that was
here previously burnt down...

05:16.463 --> 05:18.623
In 2003.

05:20.217 --> 05:22.336
What caused the fire?

05:22.337 --> 05:25.098
Um, we really aren't sure.

05:25.099 --> 05:29.419
We know that one report said a candle.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.220
There's a lot of people around here.

05:40.221 --> 05:43.341
A lot of dead people.

05:44.915 --> 05:48.569
The people out there weren't
bad people when they died.

05:48.570 --> 05:51.390
But now they are.

05:55.602 --> 05:59.682
It was three men that ran in here.

06:00.090 --> 06:05.694
There is a fire, a raging fire,
and these idiots don't care.

06:05.695 --> 06:11.515
And they're supposed to be
helping, but they're not gonna.

06:20.777 --> 06:23.145
Okay, Suzanne, why did
you bring me in this room?

06:23.146 --> 06:27.916
There was a time when I woke up
in the middle of the night to a...

06:27.917 --> 06:30.868
What I thought was a
man's voice yelling, hey,

06:30.869 --> 06:34.788
on the baby monitor, and
then she started screaming.

06:34.789 --> 06:37.427
I ran into the bedroom to get her.

06:37.428 --> 06:42.228
And that's when I
walked into a black mass.

06:43.933 --> 06:45.568
Okay, so, what did it look like?

06:45.569 --> 06:51.469
Just a black smoke or a fog,
like if you would walk into...

06:51.948 --> 06:53.709
Blackness.

06:53.710 --> 06:59.582
And when I walked into it, she
said, monster, and covered her eyes.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.518
She had talked about monsters,

07:02.519 --> 07:07.859
and I didn't really believe
her until that happened.

07:24.141 --> 07:27.321
There's something here.

07:27.409 --> 07:31.189
It's a big, solid, black mass.

07:36.186 --> 07:40.256
And a bunch of people that
are halfway in the walls.

07:40.257 --> 07:42.591
And they're see-through.

07:42.592 --> 07:46.328
Could this maybe be the portal
that you were talking about?

07:46.329 --> 07:48.249
Yeah.

07:48.737 --> 07:52.277
It's been here for... ever.

07:53.503 --> 07:56.071
Do you know if any of these
people go into the house at all,

07:56.072 --> 07:58.207
besides, like, just these walls?

07:58.208 --> 08:00.342
Yes, they can get in the house.

08:00.343 --> 08:05.023
Okay, and what about
the... the big mass...

08:05.815 --> 08:07.816
That you saw back there?

08:07.817 --> 08:11.237
It's keeping them trapped.

08:18.328 --> 08:22.588
Macy hasn't slept in this room for...

08:22.865 --> 08:24.456
Three years.

08:24.457 --> 08:27.868
One time, which was
really frightening she,

08:27.869 --> 08:32.489
told me that a monster
had picked her up.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.076
And did what?

08:34.077 --> 08:39.897
She was in the air, and then
she was on the ground again.

08:40.054 --> 08:43.010
And it's really scaring...

08:43.010 --> 08:45.229
Us to know that...

08:45.230 --> 08:50.375
Now Andy, our 3-year-old, is
seeing the same things that,

08:50.376 --> 08:54.135
you know, Macy was talking
about at that same age.

08:54.136 --> 08:57.992
There was a time when we
were standing in the kitchen.

08:57.993 --> 09:02.359
And she started... like,
she was talking to somebody.

09:02.360 --> 09:05.807
And she started saying, I
don't want to go in the woods.

09:05.808 --> 09:07.972
I'm scared of the woods.

09:07.973 --> 09:10.958
What do you think is
going on in this house?

09:10.959 --> 09:16.599
I don't know. Just... we
would really like some answers.

09:22.618 --> 09:26.856
So, is this portal dangerous
to the living in any way?

09:26.857 --> 09:28.717
Yes.

09:29.165 --> 09:31.767
- Became, like, a path.
- Okay.

09:31.768 --> 09:34.640
Like, literally a path.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.581
And I feel so bad.

09:37.881 --> 09:41.181
I don't feel good here.

09:54.933 --> 09:56.178
I don't feel good here.

09:56.179 --> 10:01.039
Like, I can't breathe,
and my head is dizzy.

10:01.384 --> 10:05.224
This is where the depression is.

10:06.423 --> 10:08.088
There is a lady here.

10:08.089 --> 10:10.839
She rules this structure.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.475
People do see her.

10:12.476 --> 10:15.979
It would be, like, a
white mist, you know? Uh...

10:15.980 --> 10:20.720
And a movement, because
she's always moving.

10:20.860 --> 10:23.463
She has a weird...

10:23.464 --> 10:25.595
Uh, sense of humor.

10:25.596 --> 10:31.496
Like, she'd make somebody trip and
fall, and she'd think that's hilarious.

10:36.946 --> 10:38.804
B.J., I was talking to your wife.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.696
She mentioned that you actually grew
up on this property your whole life.

10:41.697 --> 10:46.065
Yes. I am the third
generation to live out here.

10:46.066 --> 10:49.673
I'd love the chance to hand
it down to my kids, but...

10:49.674 --> 10:54.376
I don't want to hand it
down the way it is right now.

10:54.377 --> 10:56.928
Why don't you tell me a little
bit about what's going on?

10:56.929 --> 10:59.731
The thing that's happened with
the kids, first it was Macy.

10:59.732 --> 11:02.000
She's the oldest, and
when she was about 3,

11:02.001 --> 11:05.503
she started saying that she's
seeing monsters and ghosts.

11:05.504 --> 11:10.369
And that the ghosts were white
and the monsters were black.

11:10.370 --> 11:16.270
I thought it was kind of odd, but now that
Andy is 3, Andy has said the same thing.

11:16.715 --> 11:18.750
And now I got a
one-year-old son,

11:18.751 --> 11:22.709
and I'm just worried, is
he gonna see the same thing?

11:22.710 --> 11:24.522
Are they experiencing anything else?

11:24.523 --> 11:27.458
Yes, almost every
night, we hear footsteps,

11:27.459 --> 11:30.170
and that's throughout
the entire upstairs.

11:30.171 --> 11:33.182
- Was anybody up here?
- No.

11:33.183 --> 11:36.423
It's starting to get very concerning.

11:36.424 --> 11:41.176
In this room, we had something that
would mimic what was being said.

11:41.177 --> 11:43.338
So, whatever you guys are
talking about, something's...

11:43.339 --> 11:44.779
- Repeating it.
- Like a parrot?

11:44.780 --> 11:46.430
Yes.

11:46.431 --> 11:47.665
Okay.

11:47.666 --> 11:53.164
I want my children to be able to grow
up happy and have a normal childhood.

11:53.165 --> 11:59.065
And feel safe in their home, where
they don't have to worry about monsters.

12:09.811 --> 12:15.031
This lady... she is able
to manipulate sound waves.

12:15.947 --> 12:19.899
Like, she can make it sound
like there's a lot of people...

12:19.900 --> 12:24.820
Walking or in a room,
but there's really not.

12:25.373 --> 12:29.213
So, she could make noise, noise.

12:30.510 --> 12:33.046
I do feel like people see her, though.

12:33.047 --> 12:36.169
- Like, the younger people in the house.
- Uh-huh.

12:36.170 --> 12:40.349
She is... she'll try to
hear them breathing, and...

12:40.350 --> 12:44.970
You know, she's very
smothering, you know?

12:50.228 --> 12:54.668
She wants to make clear
that she's a protector.

12:54.669 --> 12:56.625
Why do you say that? Like...

12:56.626 --> 13:01.906
Because she thinks that
the adults here are satanic.

13:04.711 --> 13:07.847
This is by far the most
uncomfortable room for me.

13:07.848 --> 13:08.993
Why?

13:08.994 --> 13:11.778
When I'm laying here, every once
in a while, I can catch a shadow,

13:11.779 --> 13:14.659
run past the door.

13:15.122 --> 13:18.361
Now let me ask a question, you
got big windows here could it be,

13:18.362 --> 13:21.328
from cars or trucks coming up the road?

13:21.329 --> 13:23.362
I seriously doubt it.

13:23.363 --> 13:24.831
Anything else in this room?

13:24.832 --> 13:28.271
Yes. I got up in the morning
to get ready for work,

13:28.272 --> 13:31.457
and it's not uncommon for
Andy, our middle child,

13:31.458 --> 13:34.834
to come in some time in the middle
of the night and climb in bed with us.

13:34.835 --> 13:39.788
So, as I'm getting up, I see a little
blond-haired girl laying in bed.

13:39.789 --> 13:43.725
So I just think it's Andy, she came
in. So, I cover her up with the covers,

13:43.726 --> 13:47.563
go get ready, come back out,
get ready to leave for work,

13:47.564 --> 13:50.533
and I asked my wife where Andy was.

13:50.534 --> 13:54.970
She said that Andy slept
in her room all night.

13:54.971 --> 13:57.106
B.J., has anything else happened?

13:57.107 --> 13:58.140
Yes.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.242
- I was laying in bed.
- Okay.

14:00.243 --> 14:02.214
As I was laying there I felt,

14:02.215 --> 14:06.818
like something came up and
grabbed my arm like this.

14:06.819 --> 14:08.283
- Hard?
- Hard.

14:08.284 --> 14:09.818
- Were you in bed alone?
- Yes.

14:09.819 --> 14:13.659
There was no one there. Nothing.

14:18.214 --> 14:23.614
This lady... she has so
much control over this house.

14:25.063 --> 14:28.603
She's, uh, pious, she says.

14:28.967 --> 14:32.208
She thinks that the reason
why she's still here...

14:32.209 --> 14:33.409
Mm-hmm.

14:33.410 --> 14:36.530
Is to do God's work.

14:38.648 --> 14:42.184
I don't think she likes
some people in the house.

14:42.185 --> 14:44.819
She feels they're...

14:44.820 --> 14:46.639
Satanic.

14:46.640 --> 14:50.300
She has to protect, because...

14:50.960 --> 14:54.080
They're unholy people.

14:55.815 --> 15:00.969
She's talking about somebody having
or they've had or they're gonna...

15:00.970 --> 15:04.873
Gonna have a near-death experience?

15:04.874 --> 15:06.609
That'll bring them closer to God.

15:06.610 --> 15:09.992
Is that somebody that's living
or someone that's here now?

15:09.993 --> 15:15.213
It's a male that she
really wants to do this to.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.375
It's obvious that B.J. and
Suzanne are experiencing a lot,

15:33.376 --> 15:37.997
but they don't seem to know much
about the property they're living on.

15:37.998 --> 15:40.463
So my first stop is
to the town archivist.

15:40.464 --> 15:46.364
She said she found something that
may be really interesting to my case.

15:53.783 --> 15:57.042
So, Heather, what were you able to find
out about the property I'm investigating?

15:57.043 --> 16:00.437
Well, in my research
I found that Maggie and

16:00.438 --> 16:03.290
Edwin Williams were the
first white settlers.

16:03.291 --> 16:04.669
What do you mean, white settlers?

16:04.670 --> 16:07.482
Well, the land was actually
owned by a Miami Indian tribe.

16:07.483 --> 16:10.125
Okay. So what can you tell
me about the Williamses?

16:10.126 --> 16:13.629
They were devout Christians.
They were Presbyterians.

16:13.630 --> 16:16.427
They were active in their small church.

16:16.428 --> 16:19.840
There was a small schoolhouse nearby.
The kids would go to school there.

16:19.841 --> 16:21.699
They could, you know, worship there.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.023
- How many kids did they have?
- They had six.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.275
Did anybody from the family
actually die on the property?

16:26.276 --> 16:30.045
Yeah, actually, Edwin,
the father, he died first.

16:30.046 --> 16:32.806
Here's his obit.

16:33.873 --> 16:37.387
- He was a young guy.
- He was. He was about 40.

16:37.388 --> 16:39.377
So, it looks like he died of pneumonia?

16:39.378 --> 16:42.596
That's right, yeah. That was
very common back in those days.

16:42.597 --> 16:46.018
Okay, so, he has a wife and
six kids. How did they make out?

16:46.019 --> 16:48.987
Uh, not very well, because
about six weeks later,

16:48.988 --> 16:51.734
Maggie died, too, and here's her obit.

16:51.735 --> 16:55.335
- You're kidding me.
- Nope.

16:57.178 --> 17:00.180
- She was a young woman.
- Yeah, she was. She was about 38.

17:00.181 --> 17:03.483
And according to this,
she died of heart disease.

17:03.484 --> 17:06.243
Well... allegedly.

17:06.467 --> 17:08.267
What do you mean, allegedly?

17:08.268 --> 17:12.887
Well, I think she
died of a broken heart.

17:18.598 --> 17:21.734
As far as the depression...

17:21.736 --> 17:24.496
It's pretty bad.

17:24.672 --> 17:29.777
Well, she has this depression
from losing her family.

17:29.778 --> 17:33.213
I think because her husband died.

17:33.214 --> 17:37.484
She was probably like
thirty two, thirty three.

17:37.485 --> 17:39.747
She's alone. She was alone.

17:39.748 --> 17:44.457
When I bring up the death of loved ones,
this religious lady gets very angry.

17:44.458 --> 17:48.561
She feels like she's let her family
down, and she won't let it happen again.

17:48.562 --> 17:52.232
She wants to make clear
that she is a protector.

17:52.233 --> 17:55.631
I think she feels like she failed.

17:55.632 --> 17:59.952
I think she'd like to raise the kids.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.316
Heather says the
property I'm investigating

18:05.317 --> 18:09.216
used to be owned by Native Americans.

18:09.217 --> 18:12.737
I'm on my way to meet with a
local member of the Miami tribe.

18:12.738 --> 18:15.835
He says his people's time on
B.J. and Suzanne's property,

18:15.836 --> 18:19.256
was filled with heartbreak.

18:23.932 --> 18:26.733
Now, I understand that the
property I'm investigating,

18:26.734 --> 18:29.169
the Miami tribe actually
owned it at some point.

18:29.170 --> 18:33.406
The first person it was ever allotted
to... his name was Poqua Godfroy.

18:33.407 --> 18:38.508
He was a son of the last war Chief, Chief
Francis Godfroy of the Miami Indians.

18:38.509 --> 18:44.151
And, you know, I got a picture of his
father, Chief Francis Godfroy, right here.

18:44.152 --> 18:46.987
Matter of fact, he was
my fourth-Great Uncle.

18:46.988 --> 18:49.256
So, John, what can you
tell me about Poqua?

18:49.257 --> 18:52.392
Poqua was pretty rowdy. He had a temper.

18:52.393 --> 18:54.419
He used to drink quite a bit.

18:54.420 --> 18:59.783
Poqua was living in a time
where their land was being took.

18:59.784 --> 19:04.016
The 1938 treaty with The
United States government called

19:04.017 --> 19:07.245
for the removal of the Miamis
from the state of Indiana.

19:07.246 --> 19:12.346
And it shows them putting
the Miamis at gunpoint.

19:13.805 --> 19:19.126
They took them and moved them 750 miles
away from their homelands to Kansas.

19:19.127 --> 19:23.023
And a lot of them perished the
first winter after they got there.

19:23.024 --> 19:25.404
Did Poqua die on the property?

19:25.405 --> 19:28.760
He fell off a horse, and
they said he broke his neck.

19:28.761 --> 19:30.681
Okay.

19:36.070 --> 19:40.740
Okay, that, like...
this shouldn't be here.

19:40.741 --> 19:44.041
Ah, we've got a griper.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.977
Native American.

19:48.978 --> 19:53.718
She doesn't like it,
she is pissed about...

19:53.837 --> 19:56.357
This building.

19:57.965 --> 20:02.525
The ground was sacred
to Native Americans.

20:03.961 --> 20:09.502
You bury your dead there, and you think,
oh, that's good. Like, the tainted...

20:09.503 --> 20:15.023
You think it's good ground,
but it's not good ground.

20:15.076 --> 20:18.011
The people go and bury
their dead people there,

20:18.012 --> 20:21.367
and it brings them back, but
they're all [Bleep] mental.

20:21.368 --> 20:24.128
This isn't good.

20:25.101 --> 20:28.886
And it's because of
that black mass thing.

20:28.887 --> 20:32.657
How do you think the living
might experience this black mass?

20:32.658 --> 20:36.618
A definite feeling of intimidation.

20:38.063 --> 20:41.723
A sense of overwhelming dread.

20:42.894 --> 20:44.814
Fear.

21:00.053 --> 21:04.564
So far, I've got a family that's being
terrorized by unexplained activity.

21:04.565 --> 21:08.994
And a property connected to a
lot of Native American suffering.

21:08.995 --> 21:13.405
But I need to see if
there's anything else.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.576
Digging through the archives,
I'm shocked to discover

21:15.577 --> 21:20.073
a mass murder that
took place in the 1850s.

21:20.074 --> 21:25.974
Turns out, this violent crime happened
directly adjacent to my client's property.

21:30.618 --> 21:32.500
I've worked countless murder scenes,

21:32.501 --> 21:35.779
but this is one of the most gruesome
crimes I've ever come across...

21:35.780 --> 21:38.698
An entire family bludgeoned to death.

21:38.699 --> 21:40.967
I'm heading over to meet
with the County historian,

21:40.968 --> 21:43.670
just a mile away from where
the murders took place.

21:43.671 --> 21:49.571
He tells me it's the worst
massacre in the history of Wabash.

21:57.451 --> 22:01.131
So, Ron, why did you want to meet here?

22:01.132 --> 22:05.435
This cabin is very similar to the
one that the French family was...

22:05.436 --> 22:08.436
Brutally murdered in.

22:09.429 --> 22:14.424
The French family consisted of mom
and dad and their five children.

22:14.425 --> 22:16.026
Out of the goodness of their heart,

22:16.027 --> 22:19.620
they invited in to live with
them another family that were

22:19.621 --> 22:22.909
even in poorer circumstances
than themselves...

22:22.910 --> 22:25.911
John and Sarah Hubbard
and their son, Richard.

22:25.912 --> 22:30.116
And later on, things came
to a head between the family.

22:30.117 --> 22:33.683
They had not been getting
along too well to begin with.

22:33.684 --> 22:39.584
John Hubbard and his wife, Sarah,
decided to dispose of the French family.

22:40.494 --> 22:46.394
Using a small hammer, they bashed in
the heads of the sleeping five children.

22:47.041 --> 22:52.471
And then they killed the mother and
the father, also with the same hammer.

22:52.472 --> 22:57.632
And buried them underneath
the floor of the cabin.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.751
I am seeing a graveyard.

23:04.752 --> 23:09.221
In the graveyard, somebody
threw an antique shovel at me.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.810
And told me to start digging.

23:11.811 --> 23:15.095
And there were these little mounds.

23:15.096 --> 23:19.536
At least six mounds, three on each side.

23:23.286 --> 23:27.762
I think that those
little mounds are bones.

23:27.763 --> 23:31.065
And there is a dead person...

23:31.066 --> 23:34.186
Who committed murder...

23:34.712 --> 23:37.412
In a weird way.

23:43.173 --> 23:47.733
Secrets and scandals
are buried deep here.

23:49.631 --> 23:52.301
What was the break in the case?

23:52.302 --> 23:57.648
The break in the case was
another murder... Edward Boyle.

23:57.649 --> 24:00.609
He was about 45 to 50 years old.

24:00.610 --> 24:03.697
He was a laborer on the
rail road that they were

24:03.698 --> 24:06.182
putting in through Wabash
County at that time.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.650
We know he had some kind of education,

24:08.651 --> 24:14.023
and we know that he had about $300 to
$500 saved from working on the rail road.

24:14.024 --> 24:18.944
Back then, average man
made about $300 a year.

24:19.064 --> 24:22.910
And John Hubbard struck
up his acquaintance.

24:22.911 --> 24:25.835
And they became friends.

24:25.836 --> 24:28.670
And John offered him a place to stay.

24:28.671 --> 24:32.691
After that, Edward Boyle disappears.

24:36.982 --> 24:39.802
There's this guy.

24:40.476 --> 24:43.176
Very, very rich.

24:43.293 --> 24:46.688
He didn't know a lot of people here.

24:46.689 --> 24:50.049
And then he went missing.

24:53.750 --> 24:59.650
I feel like he was going on a business
meeting, and then he just disappeared.

25:01.072 --> 25:03.712
It was set up.

25:04.174 --> 25:07.409
Oh, I'm gonna say he was murdered.

25:07.410 --> 25:10.079
Hubbard is seen in town
spending a lot of money...

25:10.080 --> 25:14.206
Money that he had never had
before... and Boyle was gone.

25:14.207 --> 25:16.249
Detectives put two and two together.

25:16.250 --> 25:19.154
They come looking for Hubbard
and start talking to him.

25:19.155 --> 25:20.946
Now, what was the cause
of death for Boyle?

25:20.947 --> 25:24.493
He had been bludgeoned to death
and then he had been stabbed.

25:24.494 --> 25:27.292
How far was the body found from
the property I'm investigating?

25:27.293 --> 25:29.464
About a half mile or less.

25:29.465 --> 25:33.269
Okay, so, how does that murder tie
into the murders of the French family?

25:33.270 --> 25:36.500
One day, Mrs. Hubbard
decided to visit her husband

25:36.501 --> 25:40.309
while he was in jail facing
charges on that murder.

25:40.310 --> 25:44.653
He asked his wife, how's
the family under the floor?

25:44.654 --> 25:49.544
And it just happened to be that there were
two detectives sitting out there listening,

25:49.545 --> 25:53.312
and from that, they decided
to come to the house.

25:53.313 --> 25:55.515
So, now, what happens to Hubbard?

25:55.516 --> 25:57.740
Hubbard is uh...

25:57.741 --> 26:01.821
Tried, found guilty, and he's hung.

26:01.856 --> 26:03.432
Now, what happened to the wife?

26:03.433 --> 26:07.933
She spends the rest of her life in jail.

26:14.368 --> 26:17.980
There was several entities
that stood out during my walk.

26:17.981 --> 26:23.085
But what has me the most concerned
is the portal in the basement.

26:23.086 --> 26:25.785
One of these walls...

26:25.786 --> 26:31.426
Had, like, a tiny little
pathway coming out of the wall.

26:31.995 --> 26:36.195
Halfway out of the wall are two men.

26:37.941 --> 26:41.001
They were translucent.

26:44.274 --> 26:47.394
Is this what you saw?

26:48.497 --> 26:50.357
Yes.

27:17.398 --> 27:20.100
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

27:20.101 --> 27:22.435
We are ready to reveal
our findings to each other.

27:22.436 --> 27:26.516
And our clients for the first time.

27:28.609 --> 27:31.045
Amy, I want to introduce
you to B.J. and Suzanne.

27:31.046 --> 27:32.980
They've lived here
for about eight years.

27:32.981 --> 27:37.099
They've been experiencing stuff ever since
they moved in, but basically dealt with it.

27:37.100 --> 27:40.587
Key thing that changed now is
they have three beautiful children.

27:40.588 --> 27:43.439
And two of the older ones
are experiencing things,

27:43.440 --> 27:46.124
that make them so scared, they
don't even want to stay in the house.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.607
With that, I'm gonna ask
Amy to tell us about her walk

27:48.608 --> 27:53.468
and see if we can find
out what's going on.

27:57.630 --> 28:03.249
So, one thing that I got was inside
the house, and it was a female.

28:03.250 --> 28:07.090
And she is very, very religious.

28:07.376 --> 28:10.465
She believes that this
house is her domain.

28:10.466 --> 28:12.419
Her husband died.

28:12.420 --> 28:17.257
She has a huge amount of
depression surrounding his death.

28:17.258 --> 28:20.556
And she also felt like
she let down her children.

28:20.557 --> 28:24.217
She looked like she
was in her early 30s.

28:24.218 --> 28:27.681
Well, that's interesting you
say that because the first white

28:27.682 --> 28:32.849
settlers to live on your property were a
young couple, Edwin and Margaret Williams.

28:32.850 --> 28:35.820
He died at the age of 40 of pneumonia.

28:35.821 --> 28:37.109
Oh.

28:37.110 --> 28:39.791
Five to six weeks later, she dies.

28:39.792 --> 28:43.232
She died at the age of
38. She had six children.

28:43.233 --> 28:47.265
According to the obituary,
she dies of heart disease.

28:47.266 --> 28:49.660
Her emotion does spill
out into the house...

28:49.661 --> 28:55.481
Like, her emotional state, which
is really severe depression.

28:57.230 --> 29:00.312
Several years ago, B.J.,

29:00.313 --> 29:03.695
had a really bad bout of depression...

29:03.696 --> 29:05.916
Very bad.

29:10.098 --> 29:12.078
And...

29:12.291 --> 29:18.191
And it took a couple of years
for him to come up out of it.

29:18.485 --> 29:22.505
The dead will influence the living.

29:25.571 --> 29:28.894
Well, I think she
really loved her husband.

29:28.895 --> 29:32.177
She probably felt guilt
for leaving the children,

29:32.178 --> 29:35.280
and she's always watching you guys.

29:35.281 --> 29:38.941
You do not have privacy here.

29:42.350 --> 29:46.791
If people do see her, it would
be more like a white mist.

29:46.792 --> 29:50.140
Macy, when she was 3,
would tell us that...

29:50.141 --> 29:52.964
Monsters are black and ghosts are white.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.524
And now our three-year-old...

29:55.525 --> 29:58.351
Has told me just recently...

29:58.352 --> 30:01.540
Monsters are black and ghosts are white.

30:01.541 --> 30:03.007
Ooh.

30:03.008 --> 30:07.060
Almost every night, we hear
footsteps upstairs on the loft.

30:07.061 --> 30:09.514
She can mess with sound waves.

30:09.515 --> 30:13.518
What kind of things would
she be able to make them hear?

30:13.519 --> 30:18.723
People walking around, a lot of
people talking, someone talking.

30:18.724 --> 30:21.891
Macy was upstairs and...

30:21.892 --> 30:26.512
She told us that a
monster picked her up.

30:27.242 --> 30:30.054
When the kids are seeing this
white thing, do you think it's her?

30:30.055 --> 30:32.003
Yeah. That's how she would appear.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.781
But I don't think she's
the one lifting them up.

30:34.782 --> 30:37.902
That's something else.

30:39.102 --> 30:43.281
I know what the woman,
the white mist, wants.

30:43.282 --> 30:46.874
She actually wants to
protect the children.

30:46.875 --> 30:49.287
She might come across as smothering.

30:49.288 --> 30:53.608
She's felt that you guys were satanic.

30:55.860 --> 30:58.262
Well, let me ask you a question
flat-out. You guys religious?

30:58.263 --> 31:00.085
Go to church? You don't go to church?

31:00.086 --> 31:02.133
- We don't.
- No, we don't go to church.

31:02.134 --> 31:05.648
The whole thing is, is when
you get religious zealots,

31:05.649 --> 31:09.862
they believe that it's
their way or no way.

31:09.863 --> 31:13.745
And she was extreme
in her belief system.

31:13.746 --> 31:19.646
And she really does have her
sights set on you, in particular.

31:20.073 --> 31:24.256
She feels like she is
here to lead you to God.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.654
That's her mission.

31:25.655 --> 31:30.688
And you, in particular, she feels the
only way she can do that with you is...

31:30.689 --> 31:33.929
A near-death experience.

31:36.168 --> 31:37.926
What else did you see?

31:37.927 --> 31:41.346
Outside, I saw a graveyard.

31:41.347 --> 31:44.210
Uh, there were a bunch of
mounds. Like, six of them.

31:44.211 --> 31:48.650
And, so, someone threw
me a antique shovel...

31:48.651 --> 31:51.656
And told me to start digging.

31:51.657 --> 31:56.024
I think that those
little mounds are bones.

31:56.025 --> 31:59.484
And there is a dead person...

31:59.485 --> 32:02.605
Who committed murder...

32:03.092 --> 32:05.792
In a weird way.

32:07.866 --> 32:13.766
I kept hearing somebody say that
scandals and secrets lie deep here.

32:14.443 --> 32:16.808
Well, I don't know if
it's what you saw but,

32:16.809 --> 32:20.111
one of the things I came
across is back in 1854...

32:20.112 --> 32:22.376
There was a family
by the name of French.

32:22.377 --> 32:26.451
And they took in this couple
called the Hubbards and their son.

32:26.452 --> 32:29.354
So, what the Hubbards wind
up doing is, basically,

32:29.355 --> 32:32.890
one night they got up and they
beat them to death with hammers.

32:32.891 --> 32:34.871
What?!

32:34.893 --> 32:36.951
It was two parents and five children.

32:36.952 --> 32:38.934
Oh, my gosh.

32:38.935 --> 32:42.334
They dug out a shallow
grave underneath...

32:42.335 --> 32:45.452
This tiny shack they lived in.

32:45.453 --> 32:49.966
And they buried them
on top of each other.

32:49.967 --> 32:55.867
It's probably one of the worst murders
I've come across, and I've seen everything.

33:04.181 --> 33:09.952
So, out back, I saw this man,
and he wasn't from this town,

33:09.953 --> 33:12.025
and he had just kind of come here.

33:12.026 --> 33:15.035
He didn't really know anybody.
And then he went missing.

33:15.036 --> 33:20.936
And he was laying in a very shallow
grave, and I knew he was murdered.

33:21.079 --> 33:22.913
That's incredible.

33:22.914 --> 33:24.982
There was a guy named Edward Boyle.

33:24.983 --> 33:27.308
Came here to work on the rail roads.

33:27.309 --> 33:30.588
John Hubbard befriended this guy.
Next thing you know, he goes missing.

33:30.589 --> 33:33.690
They actually found Edward
Boyle stabbed and beaten

33:33.691 --> 33:39.130
and thrown into a shallow
grave right off the river here.

33:39.131 --> 33:42.399
It's ironic how Hubbard gets
caught for the French murders,

33:42.400 --> 33:47.871
because he's in jail for the Edward Boyle
murder, and his wife comes to visit him.

33:47.872 --> 33:52.042
He says to her, hey, how are those
seven people doing underneath the cabin?

33:52.043 --> 33:54.167
This is overheard by a jailer,

33:54.168 --> 33:57.515
who puts two and two together and
says, that whole family who disappeared.

33:57.516 --> 34:01.003
They send some authorities out there,
and as soon as they get towards the cabin,

34:01.004 --> 34:02.653
they could smell death.

34:02.654 --> 34:05.922
- He wound up getting hung.
- What about his wife?

34:05.923 --> 34:07.691
She died in jail.

34:07.692 --> 34:10.134
The murderers of the French family,

34:10.135 --> 34:16.034
would have never been caught had it
not been for the murder of Edward Boyle.

34:17.101 --> 34:19.612
So, how'd the rest of your
walk go? What did you see?

34:19.614 --> 34:24.790
The next thing was I came into
contact with this Native American lady.

34:24.791 --> 34:28.109
And she was just going off about,

34:28.110 --> 34:32.163
you know, how this was,
like, once sacred ground.

34:32.164 --> 34:36.123
And now it's become very tainted.

34:37.922 --> 34:41.627
Now, your land was owned, at
one time, by the Miami tribe.

34:41.628 --> 34:45.396
Actually, your property itself
was owned by a guy named Francis.

34:45.397 --> 34:47.331
He was the Chief of
the Miami tribe here.

34:47.331 --> 34:50.467
His son, Poqua, owned your land.

34:50.467 --> 34:53.429
Now, I spoke to one of his descendants.

34:53.429 --> 34:57.016
And he described Poqua
as a feisty type of guy.

34:57.016 --> 34:58.908
He liked to drink. He was a boozer.

34:58.909 --> 35:02.574
He did not like the
white man whatsoever.

35:02.575 --> 35:05.841
As far as I could tell, they had pretty
good reason, and I'll tell you why.

35:05.842 --> 35:09.130
When the government came in, they
basically took the Miami tribe,

35:09.131 --> 35:13.849
put them on canal boats, and
shipped them off to Kansas.

35:13.850 --> 35:17.545
They called it the Great Removal.

35:17.546 --> 35:19.756
Now, I have a picture...

35:19.757 --> 35:23.297
Of how it looked back then.

35:23.477 --> 35:25.189
Oh...

35:25.190 --> 35:27.014
Man. Okay.

35:27.015 --> 35:32.415
- What's that?
- No, I think I figured something out.

35:32.770 --> 35:37.239
It makes sense, because... okay,
this is what else I saw, was uh...

35:37.240 --> 35:39.328
I saw about 20 people.

35:39.329 --> 35:43.716
They weren't bad in life, but now
that they're dead, they're twisted.

35:43.717 --> 35:45.353
And um...

35:45.354 --> 35:49.854
They're being held by a huge black mass.

35:50.354 --> 35:53.456
And now I'm thinking it
might have been Poqua.

35:53.457 --> 35:55.636
But what's he doing with them, though?

35:55.637 --> 35:57.827
- Or this mass or whatever.
- He just... I don't know.

35:57.828 --> 36:02.231
He screws them up mentally,
and he just has them trapped.

36:02.232 --> 36:05.167
Is it to torture them or to use them?

36:05.168 --> 36:07.088
Both.

36:10.173 --> 36:13.483
When I went into the
basement, there's a pathway.

36:13.484 --> 36:17.257
That the dead can use to
come in and out of your house.

36:17.258 --> 36:22.040
And the people can, and
so can the black mass.

36:22.041 --> 36:25.865
They can travel back and forth, and
these dead people can be dangerous.

36:25.866 --> 36:29.466
And have very bad intentions.

36:50.013 --> 36:55.299
These people that are outside,
do they come into the house?

36:55.300 --> 36:59.980
The people can, and
so can the black mass.

37:01.358 --> 37:04.881
They can travel back and forth, and
these dead people can be dangerous,

37:04.882 --> 37:10.582
because they're twisted and
they have very bad intentions.

37:14.908 --> 37:18.907
Talking about a black
mass, listen to this story.

37:18.908 --> 37:21.897
One night, her daughter
was actually crying.

37:21.898 --> 37:24.294
She went up to get her
out of the bedroom, and...

37:24.295 --> 37:26.275
And...

37:26.515 --> 37:30.285
When I carried her
back into our bedroom...

37:30.286 --> 37:35.086
All of a sudden, there
was this... blackness.

37:35.716 --> 37:41.236
And she then, like, covered
her eyes and said, monster.

37:45.798 --> 37:49.698
And I knew it was what she saw.

37:51.174 --> 37:54.354
Because I saw it, too.

37:58.769 --> 38:02.369
I did sketch a scene of it.

38:10.806 --> 38:12.666
Wow.

38:20.710 --> 38:24.155
It's a pathway for the dead.

38:24.156 --> 38:27.936
And this huge, huge black mass.

38:31.641 --> 38:37.541
I think that a lot of the dead here,
they kind of get sucked in the pathway.

38:38.587 --> 38:41.323
Unfortunately, it seems to
be a pathway that attracts

38:41.324 --> 38:43.959
people who don't understand
what's happened to them.

38:43.960 --> 38:47.896
I mean, are these the people that are...

38:47.897 --> 38:50.032
Talking to my kids?

38:50.033 --> 38:51.893
Yes.

38:54.126 --> 38:59.646
They're going to go for
them because they're so open.

39:02.946 --> 39:05.370
I know this is a lot of
information for you guys.

39:05.371 --> 39:09.784
The big question is,
are your kids safe here?

39:09.785 --> 39:12.420
Is it safe for you guys to stay
here and raise those children?

39:12.421 --> 39:16.438
Well, I can't answer that,
but hopefully Amy can.

39:16.439 --> 39:19.789
You love this place, right?

39:19.790 --> 39:22.497
- This is sacred land for you.
- Yes.

39:22.498 --> 39:25.108
And you treat it with respect and love.

39:25.109 --> 39:28.762
So, the first thing I want
you to do is to find a Deacon.

39:28.763 --> 39:31.206
Who can come here...

39:31.207 --> 39:35.310
And do a blessing for
Margaret, the pious woman.

39:35.311 --> 39:38.975
And for you guys and for the
house and for the children.

39:38.976 --> 39:44.876
This is going to make her very
happy, because you are embracing...

39:45.121 --> 39:48.190
Her faith in some respect.

39:48.191 --> 39:53.411
So, have him come and do
that... a house blessing.

39:53.540 --> 39:57.320
And tell her it's okay to go.

39:57.822 --> 40:03.722
She can go now. She needs to go
to her children and her husband.

40:04.374 --> 40:08.317
The second thing you need
to do is to seal the pathway.

40:08.318 --> 40:12.847
You can't close it,
but you can seal it up.

40:12.848 --> 40:18.420
You're going to take two things
that completely seal the dead out.

40:18.421 --> 40:21.024
And that's tar-water and brick dust.

40:21.025 --> 40:25.427
So, I'm gonna give that
to you, and we'll do that.

40:25.428 --> 40:28.363
Tar-water and brick dust
are ancient medicines

40:28.364 --> 40:30.983
often used in ritualistic practices.

40:30.984 --> 40:35.404
When used properly, they can stop
the dead from entering a location.

40:35.405 --> 40:39.374
Now, the last thing you need
to do is deal with Poqua.

40:39.375 --> 40:44.137
You're gonna have to
go to the Miami tribe.

40:44.138 --> 40:45.855
And explain what's going on.

40:45.856 --> 40:49.510
This is something I
think that the tribe...

40:49.511 --> 40:53.141
Today would not want to see happening.

40:53.142 --> 40:55.962
He's become evil.

40:56.359 --> 41:00.783
We don't want, you know, this legacy of,

41:00.784 --> 41:03.482
hate to continue.

41:03.483 --> 41:06.568
You're going to ask them
to send a medicine man,

41:06.569 --> 41:11.009
to come and have a chat with his elder.

41:11.524 --> 41:13.241
Will this get rid of him?

41:13.242 --> 41:14.989
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:14.990 --> 41:18.770
It's coming from his ancestors.

41:21.917 --> 41:26.903
So, the ultimate question is, once they
do all this, do you think they'll be okay?

41:26.904 --> 41:29.428
Will these guys be able to
raise their kids here safely?

41:29.429 --> 41:31.438
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:31.439 --> 41:35.317
You look like the most
relieved mother I've ever seen.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.210
I think she is.

41:37.211 --> 41:41.540
Now you can pass this land and
this house on to your children,

41:41.541 --> 41:44.901
without worrying about it.

41:45.228 --> 41:48.330
I really hope B.J. and
Suzanne follow my advice

41:48.331 --> 41:53.851
and deal with the evil that's
terrorizing their family.

41:54.916 --> 41:58.139
With the help of a medicine man
and the tools I've given them,

41:58.140 --> 42:04.017
they should be able to free their
home of the darkness that surrounds it.
