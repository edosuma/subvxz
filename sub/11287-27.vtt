00:43.233 --> 00:46.866
ENTERPRISING LADIES
BENEFITING OUR WORLD.

00:46.933 --> 00:49.333
THAT BOURGIE GROUP
THAT THINKS WEARING VERSACE

00:49.400 --> 00:51.733
IS THE BEST WAY
TO BEAUTIFY THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.666
SEE, ELBOW GIVES ME A CHANCE

00:53.733 --> 00:56.033

AT PUBLIC SCHOOL 762
WITH OUR SLOGAN:

06:35.740 --> 06:38.206
"ALCOHOL IS LOADED
WITH EMPTY CALORIES."

06:38.273 --> 06:40.406
( appreciative laughter )

06:40.473 --> 06:44.306
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF THE PROGRAM, "SCARED THIN"?

06:44.373 --> 06:45.740
( laughing ):
OH, NO!

06:45.806 --> 06:47.840
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE HER.

06:47.906 --> 06:49.840
SHE'S A HOMELESS PERSON

TO ORGANIZED CRIME

07:43.546 --> 07:45.546

07:45.613 --> 07:49.480
HIS LAST CAMPAIGN SLOGAN WAS,
"VOTE FOR ME. I'M A GOODFELLA."

07:49.546 --> 07:51.480

08:08.420 --> 08:10.153
NOW, HOLD UP, HOLD UP THERE.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.153
THIS SOUNDS KIND OF INTRIGUING.

08:12.220 --> 08:13.786
WELL, YOU WOULD
CERTAINLY HAVE

08:13.853 --> 08:15.453

borough alderman campaign

claims Miss Shaw
had an illicit affair

18:39.453 --> 18:41.853
with a 17‐year‐old boy
from New Jersey.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.686

HE TOLD ME HE WAS 19.

18:46.053 --> 18:49.520
Malaba also claims
that last year

18:49.586 --> 18:52.953
Shaw was charged
with indecent exposure.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.286
OH, HOW DARE HE!

18:54.353 --> 18:55.320
OH, MY GOD.

18:55.386 --> 18:57.020
I WAS SWIMMING
AT A NUDE BEACH

18:57.086 --> 18:58.853
WHEN A BIG WAVE
WASHED ME ASHORE

18:58.920 --> 19:00.293
AT A RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.426
MAX, MAX, MAX, MAX.

19:01.493 --> 19:02.560
LOOK, RELAX, RELAX.

19:02.626 --> 19:04.393
THIS WHOLE THING
WILL BLOW OVER

19:04.460 --> 19:06.093
BY TOMORROW,
I'M TELLING YOU.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.060
After this,
we'll have more on Maxine Shaw

19:09.126 --> 19:11.260
the so‐called "Nympho Candidate"

19:11.326 --> 19:13.660
and her steamy ties
to Kyle Barker

19:13.726 --> 19:16.226
a rising Wall Street
funds manager.

19:19.960 --> 19:23.226
OH, OVERTON,
THIS IS SO ROMANTIC.

19:23.293 --> 19:24.493
AND THE VIEW‐‐

19:24.560 --> 19:27.960
YOU KNOW, PAST THE HORSE‐‐
IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

19:28.026 --> 19:30.026
UM, SYNCLAIRE,
SOMETHING I'VE

19:30.093 --> 19:32.593
BEEN WANTING TO ASK
YOU ALL NIGHT.

19:32.660 --> 19:33.593
DAMN.

19:33.660 --> 19:35.460
RIDE'S OVER.

19:35.526 --> 19:36.960
ENJOY THE PARK.

19:37.026 --> 19:38.626
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:38.693 --> 19:40.360
THE HARNESS FELL APART.

19:40.426 --> 19:42.060
YOU PAY $50 FOR SOMETHING

19:42.126 --> 19:45.160
YOU THINK IT WOULD LAST
FOR MORE THAN 32 YEARS.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.526
WELL, GUESS I'LL
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK.

19:52.893 --> 19:54.226
COME ON, MAN!

19:54.293 --> 19:56.193
GIVE ME ALL YOUR
VALUABLE STUFF

19:56.260 --> 19:57.660
OR YOUR DEAD!

19:57.726 --> 20:00.233
OVERTON, GIVE THAT MAN
ANYTHING HE WANTS.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.700
STOP YELLING, LADY.

20:01.766 --> 20:03.033
MY HEAD HURTS.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.100
BE COOL, MAN.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.533
HERE, HERE.
YOU GOT IT.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.566
YOU GOT IT.

20:06.633 --> 20:08.733
CLEVELAND CAVALIER
CUFF LINKS?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.600
DOES EVERYBODY
IN NEW YORK

20:10.666 --> 20:12.733
HAVE A PAIR
OF THESE TONIGHT?

20:12.800 --> 20:14.700
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

20:14.766 --> 20:17.033
I MAY TAKE LITHIUM

20:17.100 --> 20:20.200
BUT I KNOW
WHEN SOMEONE'S
HOLDING OUT ON ME.

20:20.266 --> 20:22.533
COME HERE.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.833
DO YOU WORK OUT?

20:23.900 --> 20:25.700
YOU'RE PRETTY CUT.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.333
GIVE IT TO ME.

20:29.366 --> 20:30.500
THANKS, BROTHER.

20:30.566 --> 20:31.566
WHOO!

20:36.566 --> 20:38.666
OH, MY GOD. OBIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

20:38.733 --> 20:41.333
YEAH, I'M FINE.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.233
MAN, YOU HANDLED
THAT BEAUTIFULLY.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.866
I USUALLY GET KICKED
IN THE CROTCH.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.466
COME IN, DISPATCH.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.200
GOT A CODE 42.

20:50.266 --> 20:52.766
PASSENGERS OKAY. CROTCH IS FINE.

20:52.833 --> 20:54.500
HELP IS ON THE WAY.

20:54.566 --> 20:58.166
THEN THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOT TO DO.

21:00.606 --> 21:01.940
COME ON.

21:02.006 --> 21:05.173
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
SYNCLAIRE.

21:05.240 --> 21:06.573
OBIE, THEY'RE ONLY THINGS.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.740
THEY HAVE NO MEANING‐‐

21:07.806 --> 21:09.840
AND YOU ALWAYS SAID
THE CAVALIERS SUCK.

21:09.906 --> 21:11.940
NO, I AIN'T GOING OUT
LIKE THAT, BABY

21:12.006 --> 21:14.006
'CAUSE THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.006
MUCH MORE.

21:15.073 --> 21:16.740
JUST REMEMBER THAT, UM...

21:16.806 --> 21:17.740
I LOVE YOU.

21:17.806 --> 21:18.740
COME ON, GIRL.

21:18.806 --> 21:20.306
I LOVE YOU TOO.

21:28.006 --> 21:30.106
<i>WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.</i>

21:33.773 --> 21:34.973
And here are mug shots

21:35.040 --> 21:37.406
of the candidate
and her financial flame

21:37.473 --> 21:39.440
moments after they were
thrown out

21:39.506 --> 21:42.573
of a Brian McKnight concert
for disorderly conduct.

21:42.640 --> 21:46.073
OH, THIS IS TRULY
MY LOWEST MOMENT.

21:46.140 --> 21:48.006
And this just in‐‐

21:48.073 --> 21:51.806
Channel 6 has gotten hold
of an exclusive video

21:51.873 --> 21:55.006
of Maxine Shaw
with a male stripper.

21:55.073 --> 21:58.606
Max:
Officer, do you have a license
to carry that?

21:58.673 --> 22:02.213
Ooh, Officer Goodbody,
frisk me! Frisk me!

22:02.280 --> 22:05.880
