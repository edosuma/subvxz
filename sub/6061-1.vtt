00:42.459 --> 00:44.752
Blue, 18.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.881
Set. Hit. Hit.

00:55.347 --> 00:59.976
Zach. Zach. Crossbuck 30.
Crossbuck 30.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.687
Crossbuck 30. Crossbuck 30.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.397
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.816
The Eagles will go for it
on fourth down...

01:06.984 --> 01:09.902
... with 42 seconds left
in the football game and no timeouts.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.280
Coach Taylor can get
his first winning season...

01:12.448 --> 01:15.825
... for the Shiloh Christian Academy
if they can pull this play off.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.828
Blue, 18. Set, hit.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.539
Avery will take the snap.
He pitches back to Jacob Hall.

01:21.707 --> 01:25.168
Jacob's gonna try to pass it. He's got
Jeremy Johnson going down the field.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.420
- Here come the Tigers.
- Throw it, Jacob.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.213
Jacob's gonna try to tuck and run.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.424
And he's taken down
at the 40-yard line...

01:31.592 --> 01:33.301
... and stopped there
by Lewis Slaughter.

01:33.469 --> 01:35.595
Jeremy Johnson was wide open
down the field.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.889
If he'd only had
a few seconds more to throw...

01:38.056 --> 01:40.349
... this game might have had
a different outcome.

01:40.517 --> 01:44.687
As it is, the Tigers will take over now,
and will no doubt run out the clock...

01:44.855 --> 01:49.025
... ending Coach Grant Taylor's bid for
his first winning season in six years.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.319
Now he'll have to wait
until next season...

01:51.487 --> 01:53.446
... for that all-elusive
winning record.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.116
That's if they let him
come back next year.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.248
- Hi.
- Get them, Claire.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.417
Hey, Grant. Come on, you all.
Quit talking.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.837
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Hurry.

04:22.721 --> 04:32.521
What?

04:32.689 --> 04:34.482
You gotta be kidding me.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.361
- This had better be a joke.
- No.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.864
Mandy said he came in this morning,
got his papers.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.575
A player can't just transfer
to another school.

04:44.743 --> 04:48.871
- He's gotta make a change of address.
- He did. He's moving in with his dad.

05:00.092 --> 05:03.970
I can't believe that. This is
the third time this has happened.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.057
Spend three years pouring into them,
they get to their senior year...

05:08.225 --> 05:11.143
... they transfer
to a rival school. Why?

05:12.104 --> 05:13.980
Well, because at the end
of the season...

05:14.147 --> 05:17.149
... nobody wants to be on TV going,
"We're number six, baby.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.484
We're number six. "

05:20.070 --> 05:21.153
Well, you asked.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.077
Just had to go there, didn't you?

05:30.872 --> 05:34.208
- Is it true Darren switched to Tucker?
- We'll talk about it in a minute.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.585
- So it's true?
- We'll talk about it in a minute.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.295
Huddle up.

05:38.630 --> 05:42.508
Coach, is it true that Darren
transferred to Tucker?

05:44.928 --> 05:47.054
I got word that Darren did transfer
to Tucker.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.889
- God.
- Oh, my God.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.099
There goes the season.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.435
The season will be
whatever we make it.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.354
Who's gonna take his place?
He scored a third of our points.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.691
You let me worry about that.
We're not starting as if it's doomsday.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.235
- Nobody's irreplaceable.
- Darren is.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.780
Darren is not. There's more to a good
football team than a running back.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.283
This ought to push you
to take up the slack.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.035
Stop worrying about Darren.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.912
Start your drills. We got
a game to play this Friday night.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.915
Let's go, Shiloh. Come on. Let's go.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.625
All right, guys.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.486
Why'd you park
all the way out there?

06:43.653 --> 06:45.529
Had to. It died again.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.823
Why don't we get a new battery?

06:47.991 --> 06:51.202
I'll get Brady to help me tomorrow.
I don't wanna think about it now.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.830
- Do you want me to take a look at it?
- Stop it.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.667
Oh, sweetheart--

06:58.835 --> 07:02.546
Grant, I don't know what that smell is.
I've scrubbed everything I can.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.841
- It's terrible.
- I know it is, but what else can I do?

07:06.009 --> 07:07.927
I don't even know
where it's coming from.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.221
Well, this day stunk.
Why shouldn't my house?

07:10.388 --> 07:13.516
- What do you mean?
- Darren transferred to Tucker.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.851
What? He did not.

07:16.019 --> 07:19.438
Yep. Came by and got his papers,
didn't even say goodbye.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.816
- Why?
- Why do you think?

07:21.983 --> 07:24.360
Didn't see a chance of winning
at Shiloh.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.696
But it ain't like Tucker's
gonna guarantee him a scholarship.

07:27.864 --> 07:31.659
- Oh, I bet the boys are frustrated.
- More than you know.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.719
I meant to throw that away.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.514
Did you think you were pregnant?

07:54.057 --> 07:56.392
I don't know.
I just wanna be pregnant so bad...

07:56.560 --> 07:59.145
... that my mind plays tricks on me.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.241
You know, it's been four years
since we started trying.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.205
Would you be opposed
to me going to see a specialist?

08:19.833 --> 08:20.875
No.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.752
I'd just like to know what she says.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.506
Okay.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.635
I thought we were having
spaghetti tonight.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.761
Stove's not working.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.097
You are kidding me.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.769
So we got a leak in the back room,
the dryer only works half the time...

08:40.937 --> 08:44.106
... the car's dying on us
and now the stove's broken.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.775
That's about right.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.069
No wonder I'm losing my hair.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.448
I love you.

09:00.457 --> 09:05.628
And now your Georgia Sports Break
with Alicia Houston.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.840
The Richland Giants started practice
as the school year gets under way.

09:10.008 --> 09:13.677
The team will be defending
a three-year state championship run.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.888
Now they prepare to fight for a fourth.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.766
I'm here with head coach
Bobby Lee Duke of the Giants.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.185
Coach Duke, how does this year look
for the team?

09:21.353 --> 09:25.147
Alice, we've grown real fond
of the state title.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.733
And we don't see any reason
to give it up this year.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.528
I've got most of my starters coming
back and I've got a strong bench.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.697
So I've only got one thing to say:

09:33.865 --> 09:37.826
Get off the tracks,
because the freight train's coming.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.533
Move, move.

11:03.913 --> 11:07.750
I hope that's not a sign of the way the
rest of the season's gonna go, coach.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.211
- Now, why did he have to say that?
- Just let it go.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.796
I hate this car.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.591
Let's find somebody
with jumper cables and let's go home.

11:15.759 --> 11:19.428
It's bad enough you lose your first
game. Now I can't start my own car.

11:19.596 --> 11:23.182
This happens to everybody.
Don't be embarrassed about it.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.833
- Do you have jumper cables?
- Oh, sure.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.646
- Grant, I wasn't that embarrassed.
- Then why did you hide?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.816
Why does this house
have to stink so bad?

12:13.983 --> 12:17.069
You'll get used to it
after a couple of hours.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.155
Honey, we gotta do something
about the car.

12:20.323 --> 12:23.200
Because the only thing it does
faithfully for us is break down.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.077
That's about right.

12:25.245 --> 12:29.373
Would it not be better
just to get a small new car?

12:29.541 --> 12:32.334
- You know we can't afford that.
- How do other people do it?

12:32.502 --> 12:35.170
Other people make more
than 24,000 a year.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.339
You make 0000. That takes us to 30.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.509
Which is enough to help us
with repairs occasionally...

12:40.677 --> 12:42.511
... not with a new car payment.

12:42.679 --> 12:46.140
Besides, there's other bills
we don't normally have to pay.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.516
Like what?

12:48.309 --> 12:49.768
Like my doctor bill.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.397
You saw her today?

12:54.649 --> 12:57.526
- What did she say?
- She said that I'm fine.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.947
My numbers are normal and she saw
nothing that gave her concern.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.575
That's good.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.952
It doesn't mean
the problem is with you.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.163
What else could it mean?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.373
We just may not have given it
enough time.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.500
Four years?

13:15.420 --> 13:17.463
Are you still hoping
we'll have a baby?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.550
You know I am.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.719
Me too.

13:23.887 --> 13:27.723
I catch myself thinking about it
more and more.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.435
Don't you wanna know
if something's preventing it?

13:35.398 --> 13:38.066
Are you afraid
of getting checked out?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.319
Yes.

13:40.904 --> 13:41.904
Grant...

13:43.531 --> 13:48.410
... I'm still clinging to a hope
that one day we'll have children.

13:50.788 --> 13:54.458
I imagine them running
in this house.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.086
I hear them playing
in the backyard...

13:58.254 --> 14:02.883
... or running to our bed
in a thunderstorm.

14:04.886 --> 14:08.055
And I think about
reading them stories...

14:09.724 --> 14:12.768
... and teaching them songs.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.065
And I just keep thinking...

14:20.193 --> 14:23.779
... how can I miss someone
so much...

14:24.572 --> 14:26.448
... that I have never met?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.788
I'll go.

14:41.506 --> 14:45.968
Stanley.

14:47.053 --> 14:50.973
Stanley, do you wanna tell me what
you're doing on the top of my desk?

14:52.016 --> 14:53.183
No.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.979
Do you have any idea
how you got on top of my desk?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.272
No.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.899
I suggest
you get down immediately.

15:09.492 --> 15:13.161
You two can tell Coach Taylor the
reason you're late for practice today...

15:13.329 --> 15:15.497
... is because you've been
sitting in detention.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.624
Come on.
That was some serious humor.

15:17.792 --> 15:21.962
I'll get serious about your humor when
you get serious about your studies.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.508
Fifty-five?

15:26.676 --> 15:29.511
Well, if you wanna announce
your grade to the entire class...

15:29.679 --> 15:31.430
... you go right ahead.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.683
Fifty-seven.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.522
So basically we got
the toughest schedule we ever had...

15:40.690 --> 15:43.150
... and less talent than we ever had.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.485
At least we got Dewey County
on Friday night.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.362
That'll be a pretty easy win.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.407
I'm concerned it might be
our only win.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.409
No, we'll pull three or four out.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.995
That'll give us another
average season.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.831
I'm so sick of average seasons.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.710
- I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

16:01.878 --> 16:04.463
- Got a doctor's appointment.
- For what?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.715
- I have a doctor's appointment.
- For what?

16:06.883 --> 16:11.011
Leave the man alone.
He don't have to tell you.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.804
So, what's wrong with you, man?

16:13.556 --> 16:15.724
I'll be back in a couple hours.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.063
Now look what you did.
You done made him mad.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.649
Me? You're the one
that made him mad.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.235
No, not me.
Besides, I know where he's going.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.528
Where?

16:28.696 --> 16:32.574
He's going to the hair doctor.
The man is going bald.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.202
You hadn't noticed
that whole underdeveloped region?

16:35.370 --> 16:36.745
Oh, you're one to talk, Slick.

16:36.913 --> 16:41.083
No, see, when a black man goes bald,
he still looks good.

16:41.250 --> 16:46.213
Look at Michael Jordan,
George Foreman, Samuel L. Jackson.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.841
Classy-looking brothers.
Who you got? Kojak?

16:50.760 --> 16:53.595
Yeah, coach gonna get him
some plugs.

16:54.472 --> 16:58.558
- Grant would not get plugs.
- Don't laugh. You next.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.291
Your soccer skills
get better every year, son.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.878
It doesn't matter. Shiloh doesn't have
a soccer team. They play football.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.799
So? Why not kick
for the football team?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.718
They've already got a good kicker.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.303
I'm sure they wouldn't mind
having two good kickers.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.099
Dad, I'm too small. I really
just don't feel like getting killed.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.018
Are you saying
you're not interested...

17:42.186 --> 17:45.105
... or you'd like to try out
but you're afraid?

17:45.273 --> 17:47.107
What if I don't even make the team?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.860
Well, you're already
not on the team.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.321
I mean, you can't get any more not on
the team than you are right now.

17:53.990 --> 17:57.159
- Okay, Dad.
- David, you can't be afraid of failure.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.995
Everyone fails at some point.

18:00.163 --> 18:03.165
So you think I should try out
for the football team?

18:03.541 --> 18:07.836
Well, if you're waiting around
for soccer, it ain't gonna happen.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.631
Hike.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.637
- Yeah, Sam.
- Yeah, baby.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.723
Coach Owens,
have you got a minute?

18:19.891 --> 18:21.349
Yeah.

18:21.684 --> 18:25.562
Look, some of the men
have been talking.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.899
We really wanna see this school
succeed with our football program.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.026
And I know you feel
the same way too.

18:31.194 --> 18:36.907
But, frankly, we don't ever see that
happening while Coach Taylor is here.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.326
Well, you know we're in
a rebuilding season.

18:39.494 --> 18:44.372
Look, I know he's a fine man and all,
but he's had six years here...

18:44.540 --> 18:47.542
... and nothing significant
to even show for it.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.796
You know, I honestly believe
you would make a better head coach.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.677
Ready to go.

18:58.888 --> 19:02.432
Some of us have requested
a meeting with Mr. Ryker.

19:02.600 --> 19:08.146
If you would just support us, I really
believe this could go a lot easier.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.106
Mr. Pervis, I don't know.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.818
Look, it's not like
we're trying to hurt the guy.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.404
What we're doing
is for the benefit of the school.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.074
You just think about it.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.871
Good hustle, Casey.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.709
What was that about?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.336
What?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.839
Alvin Pervis.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.882
Oh, we were just talking.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.677
Everything all right?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.929
- Yeah.
- Mr. Taylor.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.472
That was great, man. Good job.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.682
Yes.

19:44.600 --> 19:48.645
I'm Larry Childers.
This is my son, David. He's a junior.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.856
- We're new to the school.
- Good to meet you.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.733
- What can I do for you?
- I just wanted to introduce myself.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.236
David wanted to know
if it was too late to try out.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.947
- You a football player?
- I've always played soccer.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.742
- I figured I could try out as a kicker.
- Okay. I got a pretty good kicker...

20:02.910 --> 20:06.955
... but I don't mind letting you try out.
Jonathan, come here.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.584
This is Jonathan. He holds
for our main kicker, Joshua Webster.

20:10.751 --> 20:14.629
Jonathan, this is David Childers.
He wants to try out as a kicker.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.299
Why don't you go try a few kicks
to get your feet wet?

20:17.466 --> 20:18.550
All right, sure.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.387
Thank you, sir. If you don't mind, I'll
just hang around till practice is over.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.598
No problem. Good to meet you.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.100
You all just move here?

20:27.268 --> 20:31.271
Yeah, from Athens. My dad got a job
teaching at the college.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.064
That's cool.

20:33.232 --> 20:37.152
I'm used to kicking soccer balls,
but I thought I could at least try out.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.280
Well, Josh is a pretty good kicker,
but he's also a receiver.

20:40.448 --> 20:43.992
I think he likes that
better than kicking. Here you go.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.006
I'm sorry.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.635
Man, I'm sorry.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.472
I'm sorry.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.603
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.028
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.336
Matt.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.716
- Let's go.
- I'm going with Brock for a little while.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.052
- Not tonight. You're coming home.
- Why?

21:44.220 --> 21:48.098
- Don't argue with me. Let's go.
- No, Dad. I'll be home later.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.391
Matt.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.121
That old man still come every week
to pray in the hallway?

22:11.539 --> 22:15.417
Mr. Bridges. Prays for the students
as he passes their locker.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.253
How long has he been doing that?

22:18.421 --> 22:21.464
He's been praying for revival
since before I got here.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.091
Lord knows we need it.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.094
Apathy in the school's
about as bad as our football record.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.512
That reminds me.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.224
I think you should go ahead
and let David Childers on the team.

22:32.226 --> 22:36.187
- You see something there?
- Well, he's just used to playing soccer.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.232
He ain't that strong,
but he shows promise.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.695
All right. I’ll give him a shot.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.960
One, two, hit.

23:07.219 --> 23:11.473
What are you doing? Go.
Let's stay in the game.

23:17.271 --> 23:20.774
No. No.

23:23.986 --> 23:27.489
Will someone tell me how we lost
to Dewey County 21 to 7?

23:28.240 --> 23:30.283
Twenty-one to seven.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.495
Dewey County hasn't beaten Shiloh
since you were in kindergarten.

23:34.830 --> 23:38.500
I don't know what you call that junk
out there, but it sure wasn't football.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.879
Nine dropped passes,
four fumbles, three interceptions.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.215
Their defense scored
most of their points.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.092
You gave the game away.

23:48.677 --> 23:52.305
You can't win football games
if you don't play together as a team.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.265
You can't win
when you're concerned...

23:54.433 --> 23:56.434
... about what you're doing
afterwards.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.812
You can't learn plays
when you miss practice...

23:58.979 --> 24:01.356
... because you're sitting in detention.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.610
I'm sick of the apathy on this team.

24:05.820 --> 24:09.572
If we're not here to win football games,
then why are we here?

24:15.871 --> 24:17.497
So do you agree with him?

24:18.165 --> 24:19.791
I don't know.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.584
I guess.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.754
Only a few guys on the team
really seem to care.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.382
So are you ready
to play in the game?

24:27.550 --> 24:30.635
I don't know why they would use me
when they've got Joshua Webster.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.847
He can kick a 45-yard field goal.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.723
I bet you could too.

24:36.267 --> 24:39.352
Dad, I can barely kick
a 35-yard field goal.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.605
At the end of the game,
kind of glad I didn't play.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.232
That way, I can't mess up.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.068
That's fear, son.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.654
I just don't wanna
embarrass the team.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.576
David, I've asked God
since you were a baby...

24:54.743 --> 24:57.245
... that he would show how strong he is
in your life...

24:58.414 --> 25:02.167
... and that through you
people would see how good he is.

25:03.085 --> 25:06.838
Then why would he make me
so small and weak?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.007
To show how mighty he is.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.971
Why don't we go ahead and wash up
for dinner? We can finish this later.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.681
All right.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.819
Dad.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.492
Okay. I'm okay.

26:17.660 --> 26:20.578
- What were you doing?
- You missed a spot up there.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.664
Thought I could get it for you.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.250
I guess I got a little too ambitious.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.002
I was just trying to take a swing at it.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.767
So, what does that mean?

26:42.935 --> 26:47.522
I mean, is there a procedure? Or--?
I mean, what are my options?

26:48.649 --> 26:52.568
Grant, first you need you realize this
is a fairly common problem for men.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.863
There are thousands of couples
who are unable to have children.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.532
You do have options.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.535
Although there's only
a 10 percent chance of success...

27:00.703 --> 27:02.954
... many couples have tried
in vitro fertilization.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.415
We can't afford that.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.793
Well, the other option
is to adopt a child.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.546
But it's about as expensive
either way.

27:11.714 --> 27:15.508
If you're interested, I'll put you in touch
with the local agency.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.721
I realize this is difficult
for you to hear.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.765
At least you and your wife can
make the best decision...

27:22.933 --> 27:25.184
... now that you know where you are.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.868
Sorry. I didn't realize
anybody was still here.

27:42.036 --> 27:45.288
- Hey, Steve.
- Putting in late hours tonight?

27:45.456 --> 27:48.916
Yeah, I guess so.
I can lock up. You can take off.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.127
All right. Thanks, coach.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.790
It's about the boys now.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.875
I'm not asking you to throw him out.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.211
If Shiloh can invest
in a winning coach...

28:33.379 --> 28:35.588
... we don't need to be
settling for second best.

28:35.756 --> 28:38.174
You can let him go
with as much class as you want to.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.636
- Alvin, he's a good man.
- I'm not saying he's not a good man.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.138
I'm saying he's not a good coach.

28:44.306 --> 28:48.184
Come on, Dan. Just look at the facts.
His record speaks for itself.

28:48.352 --> 28:52.021
- We need new leadership.
- I still think he deserves more time.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.273
More time? He's had six years.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.984
If he was capable of winning,
he'd have done it by now.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.487
Grant Taylor is not capable
of winning.

28:59.655 --> 29:02.532
He doesn't have it in him.
That's the whole point.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.242
Dan, I'm not attacking the coach.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.036
I want my son to have
the best football program possible.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.914
Look, my son's got a chance
for a football scholarship...

29:10.082 --> 29:12.250
... if he's taught by the right coach.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.252
Matt's gonna be a senior next year.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.422
I don't wanna see him lose
this opportunity.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.509
Brady, you're awfully quiet.
What's your take on this?

29:22.136 --> 29:24.220
Honestly, I don't know.

29:24.388 --> 29:28.349
Sometimes I think Grant could do
a better job of building this program.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.978
Other times, I think he's doing
just as good as any else would...

29:32.146 --> 29:33.354
... in this situation.

29:33.522 --> 29:36.232
Brady, you could do better
than Coach Taylor.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.776
- What we need is a change.
- Now.

29:38.944 --> 29:42.029
We're losing booster support,
game attendance is down...

29:42.197 --> 29:44.991
... and from the looks of it,
we've already lost this season.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.869
- That's right.
- Dan, we've got a weak program...

29:48.036 --> 29:49.829
... because we've got a weak coach.

29:49.997 --> 29:53.166
He's dead weight.
We need to cut him loose.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.930
Have you been at school
all this time?

30:08.474 --> 30:10.016
Yes.

30:10.267 --> 30:14.353
I tried to call you an hour ago.
Is everything all right?

30:21.153 --> 30:24.363
Grant, talk to me.

30:28.076 --> 30:30.411
I don't know where to start.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.373
What's going on?

30:37.794 --> 30:40.505
I was trying to lock up for Steve...

30:41.632 --> 30:44.091
... and I overheard Dan meeting
with some fathers.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.721
They didn't know I was there.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.935
Brooke, they're pushing him
to get rid of me.

30:56.104 --> 31:01.776
Neil Prater, Alvin Pervis, Luke Rae.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.947
They said I wasn't capable of winning.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.950
Called me dead weight.

31:09.117 --> 31:12.370
They can't make Dan fire you.
You've still got support.

31:12.538 --> 31:16.791
You just go get J. T. and Brady
and see him tomorrow.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.126
Brady was there.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.636
They've just lost confidence in me.

31:30.931 --> 31:36.894
I was so sure I could turn this program
around and I've just sunk it lower.

31:40.065 --> 31:44.318
Brooke, I've tried so hard.
Why can't I win?

31:44.486 --> 31:48.489
You can win.
Stop beating yourself up, Grant.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.909
Brooke, I can't provide you
with a decent home.

31:52.077 --> 31:55.037
I can't provide you
with a decent car.

31:55.789 --> 31:59.125
I'm a failing coach
with a losing record.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.297
And I can't give you
the children you want.

32:06.008 --> 32:07.717
What?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.179
It's me.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.016
Like everything else is me.

32:17.311 --> 32:20.855
We can't have our own children
because of me.

32:22.983 --> 32:24.692
What's God doing?

32:25.527 --> 32:28.362
I mean, why is it so hard?

32:29.823 --> 32:32.408
It's okay, Grant.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.703
It's okay.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.382
"I love you, O Lord, my strength.

34:12.551 --> 34:16.637
The Lord is my rock and my fortress,
my deliverer...

34:16.804 --> 34:19.431
... my God in whom I trust...

34:19.599 --> 34:24.478
... my shield and the horn
of my salvation, my stronghold.

34:24.646 --> 34:28.149
I will call upon the Lord
who is worthy to be praised.

34:28.315 --> 34:31.652
So shall I be saved
from my enemies. "

34:33.572 --> 34:35.822
Lord Jesus, would you help me?

34:35.991 --> 34:38.117
I need you.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.663
Lord, I feel like there's giants
of fear and failure...

34:42.831 --> 34:45.750
... just staring down at me
waiting to crush me.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.627
And I don't know how
to beat them, Lord.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.672
I'm tired of being afraid.

34:53.175 --> 34:56.677
Lord, if you want me
to do something else, show me.

34:57.679 --> 35:01.223
If you don't want me to have children,
so be it.

35:02.559 --> 35:05.019
But you're my guide.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.646
You're on the throne.

35:08.982 --> 35:12.109
You can have
my hopes and my dreams.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.113
Lord, give me something.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.532
Show me something.

35:46.061 --> 35:49.396
If the Lord never gives us children,
will you still love him?

36:11.044 --> 36:12.211
Field-goal unit.

36:12.379 --> 36:16.590
Hold on, Joshua. I wanna give David
a shot at this one. David, come here.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.718
This is your field goal.
Put us on the board.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.012
You're gonna go with David?

36:34.734 --> 36:38.445
- Come on, David. Come on, David.
- Hit.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.118
Come on.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.455
It's all right, man. It's all right.
You'll get it next time.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.637
Dad, I don't even know why
they let me on the team.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.598
Did you do your best, son?

37:05.765 --> 37:07.975
I knew I was gonna miss it
before I kicked it.

37:08.143 --> 37:11.770
Your actions will always
follow your beliefs, David.

37:11.938 --> 37:14.273
Dad, I can't even kick it straight.

37:14.441 --> 37:18.569
And I can't walk. Should I just
stay home and pout about it?

37:19.321 --> 37:23.282
If you accept defeat, David,
then that's what you'll get.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.874
Well, Brady, another fine example...

37:32.042 --> 37:35.252
... of Grant Taylor's
wonderful coaching abilities.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.672
Look, the kids don't deserve it.
The fans don't deserve it.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.091
When you gonna get
a bellyful of this guy?

37:41.259 --> 37:43.510
What's it gonna take?
You got a chance, man.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.805
You got a chance to step in
and take over this program...

37:46.973 --> 37:49.099
... and carry it up for a while.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.268
When are you gonna get
sick and tired of it?

37:51.436 --> 37:54.980
You got an opportunity here.
This program's going in the tank.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.024
Ryker's gotta--

38:12.165 --> 38:13.958
Grant, he came to me.

38:17.879 --> 38:20.506
You're not doing anybody any favors
sitting on the fence.

38:20.674 --> 38:23.801
You determine which side
you wanna be on and stay on it.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.862
Mr. Bridges.

38:45.615 --> 38:47.408
Revelation Chapter Three says:

38:47.575 --> 38:51.161
"We serve a God that opens doors
that no one can shut...

38:51.329 --> 38:54.415
... and he shuts doors
that no one can open.

38:54.582 --> 38:58.377
He says, 'Behold, I have placed
before you an open door...

38:58.545 --> 39:00.295
... that no one can shut.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.589
I know you have a little strength...

39:02.757 --> 39:07.553
... yet you have kept my word
and have not denied my name. "'

39:08.722 --> 39:12.349
Coach Taylor,
the Lord is not through with you yet.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.810
You still have an open door here...

39:14.978 --> 39:17.104
... and until the Lord moves you...

39:17.272 --> 39:19.606
... you're to bloom
right where you're planted.

39:20.984 --> 39:24.361
I just felt led to come
and tell you that today.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.209
Mr. Bridges.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.798
Do you believe God told you
to come tell me that?

39:44.966 --> 39:46.675
I do.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.638
I admit to you I have been struggling.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.516
But I've also been praying.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.728
I just don't see him at work here.

39:59.022 --> 40:04.401
Grant, I heard a story about two
farmers who desperately needed rain.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.904
And both of them prayed for rain...

40:07.072 --> 40:11.283
... but only one of them went out
and prepared his fields to receive it.

40:11.451 --> 40:15.037
Which one do you think trusted God
to send the rain?

40:15.997 --> 40:18.665
Well, the one who prepared
his fields for it.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.460
Which one are you?

40:21.711 --> 40:24.338
God will send the rain
when he's ready.

40:24.506 --> 40:27.800
You need to prepare your field
to receive it.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.724
So this is
your new team philosophy?

41:17.892 --> 41:19.184
What do you think?

41:19.769 --> 41:22.563
I think this applies to all of life,
not just football.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.898
Well, that's my point.

41:27.861 --> 41:31.280
Ten bucks to who can tell me who won
the state championship a decade ago.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.323
- Walker Jennings.
- No.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.534
- North Metro.
- Stop guessing.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.619
You know it or you don't.

41:38.246 --> 41:41.081
- How about five years ago?
- Richland?

41:41.499 --> 41:43.500
That was three years ago.

41:43.877 --> 41:45.919
You can't remember, can you?

41:47.297 --> 41:50.007
Leads me to ask
a couple of questions.

41:50.258 --> 41:51.717
What's the purpose of this team?

41:52.427 --> 41:53.886
Win ball games.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.220
Then what?

41:55.388 --> 41:57.556
We get a trophy.
And people talk about us.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.808
Maybe. For a while.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.102
- Then what?
- I don't know.

42:02.270 --> 42:07.441
Get a scholarship, play for college
and coach Little League.

42:09.027 --> 42:12.321
What are you getting at, Grant?
You think we're just wasting our time?

42:12.488 --> 42:14.781
If our main goal is
to win games, then yes.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.700
You don't want us to win games?

42:16.868 --> 42:18.410
No.

42:18.578 --> 42:20.954
Not if that's our main goal.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.708
Winning football games
is too small a thing to live for.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.710
And I love football
as much as anybody.

42:27.462 --> 42:31.381
But even championship trophies will
one day collect dust and be forgotten.

42:33.635 --> 42:36.637
It's just that so far
all this has been about us...

42:36.804 --> 42:40.641
... how we can look good,
how we can get the glory.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.853
The more I read this book...

42:45.647 --> 42:47.898
... the more I realize
life's not about us.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.818
We're not here just to get glory,
make money and die.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.821
The Bible says
that God put us here for him.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.032
To honor him.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.160
Jesus said the most important thing
you could do...

43:00.328 --> 43:03.997
... is to love God with everything
you are and love others as yourself.

43:04.165 --> 43:08.126
So if we win every game
and we miss that, we've done nothing.

43:08.753 --> 43:11.046
Football then means nothing.

43:12.048 --> 43:15.092
So I'm here to present you
a new team philosophy.

43:15.635 --> 43:19.346
I think that football is just one
of the tools we use to honor God.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.848
So you think God does care
about football?

43:22.016 --> 43:24.476
I think he cares about your faith.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.895
He cares about where your heart is.

43:27.063 --> 43:30.023
If you can live your faith on the field,
then, yes, God cares...

43:30.191 --> 43:31.817
... because he cares about you.

43:32.277 --> 43:35.362
He sent his son Jesus to die for us
so we could live for him.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.489
That's why we're here.

43:38.408 --> 43:41.201
But, see,
it's not just on the football field.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.954
We've gotta honor him
in our relationships...

43:44.122 --> 43:48.750
... in our respect for authority,
in the classroom...

43:49.335 --> 43:52.379
... and when you're at home alone
surfing the internet.

43:57.093 --> 44:00.887
I want God to bless this team so much,
people talk about what he did.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.557
But it means we gotta give him
our best in every area.

44:03.725 --> 44:07.686
And if we win, we praise him.
And if we lose, we praise him.

44:07.854 --> 44:12.482
Either way, we honor him
with our actions and our attitudes.

44:13.276 --> 44:16.486
So I'm asking you,
what are you living for?

44:19.282 --> 44:22.242
I've resolved to give God
everything I've got...

44:22.410 --> 44:24.870
... then I'll leave the results
up to him.

44:26.748 --> 44:28.915
I wanna know if you'll join me.

44:30.251 --> 44:33.295
Your attitude's like the aroma
of your heart.

44:33.463 --> 44:36.548
If your attitude stinks,
it means your heart's not right.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.843
He sure is preachy today.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.432
What?

44:45.767 --> 44:47.768
How's your attitude, Brock?

44:48.269 --> 44:49.436
It's fine.

44:49.604 --> 44:51.938
Then you'll be okay
with the death crawl, right?

44:52.732 --> 44:55.776
All right, everybody on the goal line.
Get your partner. Let's go.

44:55.943 --> 44:59.363
All right, let's go. Show me something.
Ten yards. Move it. Let's go.

44:59.530 --> 45:03.617
Matt, let's go. Let's go, Jonathan.
Show me something. Ten yards.

45:03.785 --> 45:07.162
Show me some power. No knees.
Keep your knees off the ground.

45:07.330 --> 45:10.582
Show me something. Here we go.
Ten yards. Show me some muscle.

45:10.750 --> 45:14.086
Show me some power.
Give me some heart. Let's go.

45:14.253 --> 45:17.714
Very good, boys. Very good.
Let's run it back.

45:21.677 --> 45:23.804
Man. Brock.

45:23.971 --> 45:26.807
- Man, that's not even funny, dude.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.476
So, coach,
how strong is Westview this year?

45:29.644 --> 45:31.728
A lot stronger than we are.

45:32.438 --> 45:35.482
You already written Friday night down
as a loss, Brock?

45:35.691 --> 45:37.943
Well, not if I knew
we could beat them.

45:40.822 --> 45:42.614
Come here, Brock. You too, Jeremy.

45:45.118 --> 45:47.202
- What? Am I in trouble now?
- Not yet.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.079
I wanna see you do
the death crawl...

45:49.247 --> 45:51.665
... except I wanna see
your absolute best.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.627
What? You want me to go the 30?

45:55.795 --> 45:58.964
- I think you can go to the 50.
- The 50?

45:59.132 --> 46:01.007
I can go to the 50
if nobody's on my back.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.093
You can do it
with Jeremy on your back...

46:03.261 --> 46:05.846
... but promise
you're gonna do your best.

46:06.013 --> 46:07.264
All right.

46:07.432 --> 46:08.890
Your best.

46:09.058 --> 46:11.518
- Okay.
- You gonna give me your best?

46:11.686 --> 46:13.520
I'm gonna give you my best.

46:13.688 --> 46:15.105
All right, one more thing.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.691
- I want you to do it blindfolded.
- Why?

46:17.859 --> 46:21.111
I don't want you giving up at a
certain point when you can go further.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.697
Get down. Jeremy, get on his back.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.118
Now, get a good tight hold, Jeremy.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.996
All right. Let's go, Brock.

46:31.247 --> 46:34.040
Keep your knees off the ground.
Just your hands and feet.

46:34.208 --> 46:37.127
- A little bit left. A little bit left.
- Come on, Brock. Come on.

46:37.295 --> 46:40.213
There you go. Show me good effort.

46:41.466 --> 46:44.301
That away, Brock. You keep coming.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.180
- There you go.
- Come on, Brock.

46:48.347 --> 46:51.558
- Come on.
- It's a good start. Little bit left.

46:51.726 --> 46:53.435
Little bit left.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.604
There you go, Brock.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.064
Good strength.

47:00.485 --> 47:02.402
You gotta be kidding me.

47:03.738 --> 47:06.990
- That's it, Brock. That's it.
- Am I at the 20 yet?

47:07.158 --> 47:10.911
Forget the 20. You give me your best.
You keep going. That's it.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.538
Now don't stop, Brock.
You got more in you than that.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.332
I ain't done. I'm resting a second.

47:15.500 --> 47:19.085
You gotta keep moving. Let's go.
Don't quit till you got nothing left.

47:19.253 --> 47:22.631
There you go.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

47:23.049 --> 47:25.342
Keep moving, Brock.
That's it. You keep driving.

47:25.510 --> 47:28.470
Keep your knees off the ground.
Keep driving it. Your very best.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.889
Your very best. Your very best.

47:31.057 --> 47:34.184
Keep moving, Brock.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

47:34.352 --> 47:37.521
Keep going.
Don't quit on me. Keep going.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.941
Keep driving it. Keep your knees
off the ground. That's it.

47:41.108 --> 47:43.944
Your very best.
Don't quit on me. Your very best.

47:44.111 --> 47:47.572
Keep driving. Keep driving.
There you go. There you go.

47:47.740 --> 47:50.867
That's it. You keep driving.
Keep your knees off the ground.

47:51.035 --> 47:53.745
Don't quit till you got nothing left.

47:53.913 --> 47:56.915
Keep moving, Brock.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

47:57.083 --> 48:00.627
Keep going. I want everything you got.
Come on, keep going.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.297
- It hurts.
- Don't quit on me. Your very best.

48:04.465 --> 48:08.593
Keep driving. Keep driving.
There you go. There you go.

48:08.761 --> 48:10.428
- He's heavy.
- I know he's heavy.

48:10.596 --> 48:13.306
- I'm about out of strength.
- Then find more strength.

48:13.474 --> 48:16.476
But don't you give up on me, Brock.
You keep going, you hear me?

48:16.644 --> 48:20.480
You're doing good. You keep going.
Do not quit on me. You keep going.

48:20.648 --> 48:22.774
- It hurts.
- I know it hurts. You keep going.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.151
You keep going.
It's all heart from here.

48:25.319 --> 48:28.238
Thirty more steps.
You keep going, Brock. Come on.

48:28.406 --> 48:29.823
- Keep going.
- It burns.

48:29.991 --> 48:31.908
- Then let it burn.
- My arms are burning.

48:32.076 --> 48:34.494
It's all heart.
You keep going, Brock. Come on.

48:34.662 --> 48:38.832
Come on. Keep going. You promised
me your best. Your best.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.001
- Don't stop. Keep going.
- It's too hard.

48:41.168 --> 48:44.004
It's not too hard.
You keep going. Come on, Brock.

48:44.171 --> 48:47.173
Give me more.
Give me more. Keep going.

48:47.341 --> 48:49.342
Twenty more steps. Twenty more.

48:49.510 --> 48:53.013
Keep going, Brock.
Give me your best. Don't quit.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.849
No. Keep going. Keep going.

48:56.017 --> 48:59.561
Keep going. Don't quit. Don't quit.

48:59.729 --> 49:02.564
Don't quit.
Brock Kelley, you don't quit.

49:02.732 --> 49:04.649
Keep going. Keep going.

49:04.817 --> 49:09.112
Go, Brock Kelley. You don't quit
on me. No, you keep going.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.448
You keep going. Go, Brock.

49:11.616 --> 49:13.533
Ten more steps. Ten more.

49:13.701 --> 49:15.702
Ten more. Ten more.

49:15.870 --> 49:18.538
Keep going. Don't quit.
Give me your heart.

49:18.706 --> 49:21.625
- I can't do it.
- You can. You can.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.543
Five more. Five more.

49:23.711 --> 49:27.756
Come on, Brock. Come on.
Don't quit. Don't quit.

49:27.923 --> 49:31.801
Come on, Brock.
Two more. One more.

49:35.681 --> 49:37.474
That's gotta be fifty.

49:37.642 --> 49:40.560
That's gotta be fifty.
I don't have any more.

49:44.982 --> 49:48.318
Look up, Brock.
You're in the end zone.

49:54.909 --> 49:57.786
Brock, you are the most
influential player on this team.

49:57.953 --> 50:00.038
If you walk around defeated,
so will they.

50:01.415 --> 50:04.584
Don't tell me you can't give me more
than what I've been seeing.

50:04.752 --> 50:09.547
You just carried a 140-pound man
across this whole field on your arms.

50:12.385 --> 50:14.761
Brock, I need you.

50:15.137 --> 50:18.932
God's gifted you with the ability
of leadership. Don't waste it.

50:19.100 --> 50:20.725
Coach.

50:20.893 --> 50:22.936
Can I count on you?

50:25.773 --> 50:27.357
Yes.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.193
Coach.

50:31.278 --> 50:32.529
What is it, Jeremy?

50:33.114 --> 50:34.948
I weigh 160.

50:54.552 --> 50:57.804
All right. Who's next?

51:02.101 --> 51:05.895
Good practice, boys.
See you all tomorrow.

51:06.063 --> 51:09.816
Hey, man, for the first time in a while,
I actually feel good about Friday night.

51:09.984 --> 51:11.317
Yeah? Why?

51:11.485 --> 51:13.570
I'm just on board
with what you're doing.

51:13.738 --> 51:16.531
If they get a hold of it,
it'll change their lives.

51:16.699 --> 51:18.825
You count me in.

51:21.996 --> 51:24.873
Grant, me too.

51:25.291 --> 51:26.416
Yeah?

51:26.584 --> 51:27.917
Yeah.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.503
I feel like I owe you an apology.

51:30.755 --> 51:33.840
I just want you to know
that I'm with you.

51:35.134 --> 51:36.384
Thank you.

51:36.552 --> 51:38.428
See you tomorrow.

51:54.779 --> 51:57.614
- You need a ride, Matt?
- No, my dad's coming.

51:57.782 --> 51:59.949
Or at least, he'd better be.

52:01.660 --> 52:03.703
Can I shoot straight with you
for a minute?

52:03.871 --> 52:05.413
Sure.

52:05.581 --> 52:07.540
I feel like you owe your dad
more respect.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.501
- Why?
- Because he's your father.

52:09.668 --> 52:12.295
- You don't know him like I know him.
- I don't have to.

52:12.463 --> 52:14.881
You need to respect him
because it's the right thing.

52:15.049 --> 52:18.009
You know, coach,
my dad doesn't even like you.

52:18.427 --> 52:21.221
He thinks the school needs
to find somebody else.

52:21.388 --> 52:24.390
That's beside the point.
Scripture says to honor your parents.

52:24.558 --> 52:27.685
- And all you do is complain.
- All he does is boss me around.

52:27.853 --> 52:29.938
He doesn't even try to understand me.

52:30.105 --> 52:32.440
Matt, you can't judge your father
by his actions...

52:32.608 --> 52:34.400
... and yourself
by your intentions.

52:34.568 --> 52:37.195
It doesn't work that way.
You're not responsible for him.

52:37.363 --> 52:40.698
You're responsible for you. You honor
God by honoring your authority.

52:41.492 --> 52:45.161
You really believe in all that honoring
God and follow Jesus stuff?

52:46.121 --> 52:47.914
Yes, I do.

52:48.541 --> 52:51.584
Well, I ain't trying
to be disrespectful...

52:51.752 --> 52:53.753
... but not everybody believes in that.

52:53.921 --> 52:55.755
Religion works for some people...

52:55.923 --> 52:58.675
... but I'm just here
because I got kicked out of Westview.

52:58.843 --> 53:01.886
Matt, nobody's forcing anything
on you. Following Jesus Christ...

53:02.054 --> 53:04.722
... is a decision you're gonna
have to make for yourself.

53:04.890 --> 53:06.474
You may not wanna accept him.

53:06.642 --> 53:10.186
Because he'll change your life.
You'll never be the same.

53:11.146 --> 53:14.023
I do hope one day
you realize how much he loves you.

53:15.109 --> 53:16.776
I'll see you tomorrow.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.788
Okay. I’ll get him.
Just give me the bag.

53:28.956 --> 53:31.958
- Bring that trash bag. Set it down.
- Don't you let that touch me.

53:32.126 --> 53:35.003
I'm not gonna let him touch you.
I'm gonna get him out of here.

53:35.170 --> 53:38.882
- Oh, man, he stinks.
- I can't believe that was in my house.

53:39.049 --> 53:41.050
- Just make sure it's still dead.
- It's dead.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.636
He's probably been dead for weeks.
Oh, there you go.

53:43.804 --> 53:46.097
You just get it out of here. Out. Out.

53:46.265 --> 53:48.975
- Stop being af-- Come here. Look at it.
- No.

53:49.143 --> 53:52.270
It looks like a big hamster. Just--
Come here, come here.

53:52.438 --> 53:56.316
Don't be afraid. Just face your fear.
Look. He's got a cute little tail there.

53:56.483 --> 54:01.321
He's just got a big stink.
Look. See his cute little eyes there?

54:01.488 --> 54:05.491
See his teeth? Look at his teeth.
Almost looks like he's mad.

54:06.410 --> 54:10.204
You're terrible. I can't believe
you did that to me, Grant Taylor.

54:10.372 --> 54:13.166
You are so bad.

54:16.086 --> 54:19.005
David, right down the middle.
You got this.

54:21.008 --> 54:22.926
Right, set it up. Run it again.

54:23.093 --> 54:26.679
- Sorry, coach.
- David, listen, son.

54:26.847 --> 54:29.724
You act like you gonna miss
before you even kick the ball.

54:29.892 --> 54:32.769
See, we're gonna have to change
your whole kicking philosophy.

54:32.937 --> 54:36.356
Now, see, you're kicking wide left
or wide right.

54:36.523 --> 54:38.399
But that ain't what's gonna
get you home.

54:38.567 --> 54:41.194
The ball has got to go
through the middle.

54:41.362 --> 54:43.821
- I know, coach.
- No. No, you don't.

54:43.989 --> 54:46.032
Now, what does Scripture say
about this?

54:47.868 --> 54:49.911
Scripture says:
Wide is the gate...

54:50.079 --> 54:52.497
... and broad is the way
that leads to destruction...

54:52.665 --> 54:54.791
... and many there be that find it.

54:54.959 --> 54:58.211
Now, to us, that's wide left
and wide right.

54:59.588 --> 55:03.549
But narrow is the gate and straight
is the way that leads to life,

55:03.717 --> 55:06.219
... and few there be that find it.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.847
Anybody can kick it
wide left or wide right.

55:10.015 --> 55:13.559
My mama can kick it
wide left and wide right.

55:13.727 --> 55:16.229
- That ain't what's gonna get you home.
- Come on.

55:16.397 --> 55:19.899
It don't have to look pretty.
It don't have to look smooth.

55:20.067 --> 55:22.026
It can look like a dying duck.

55:22.194 --> 55:24.904
But the ball has to go
through the middle.

55:25.072 --> 55:26.572
Oh, my word.

55:26.740 --> 55:29.200
Now, David, you gonna have
to choose the narrow way.

55:29.827 --> 55:32.286
That's the only path
where you will get your reward.

55:32.454 --> 55:34.580
Now send this ball
through these pearly posts.

55:34.748 --> 55:36.582
Set it up one more time for me,
Jonathan.

55:36.750 --> 55:39.002
David, I've never heard it
that way before...

55:39.169 --> 55:41.713
... but there's a lot of truth
to what he's saying.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.506
Let's see you kick it.

55:53.475 --> 55:55.977
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

56:00.733 --> 56:04.193
Grant, are you not aware of what's
going on outside on the field?

56:04.361 --> 56:05.403
What?

56:05.571 --> 56:07.780
You might wanna
come check this out.

56:10.492 --> 56:13.202
Mitch decided to bring
his Bible class outside today.

56:13.370 --> 56:16.664
After he started teaching, Matt Prater
accepted Christ as his Lord.

56:16.832 --> 56:19.959
It was awesome. He started
confessing stuff from his life...

56:20.127 --> 56:22.420
... he started asking his friends
for forgiveness.

56:22.588 --> 56:25.673
Next thing we know, Bob Duke
stands up and does the same thing.

56:25.841 --> 56:29.093
Kids start breaking up into groups,
they begin to pray for each other.

56:29.261 --> 56:31.637
They ask forgiveness for sins
they've committed.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.306
This has been going on for hours.

56:33.474 --> 56:35.850
How did you not know
what was going on?

57:08.342 --> 57:12.178
Bless them in a special way.
Lord, I ask you to lift them up to you.

57:16.558 --> 57:20.353
I ask you to bring up a generation
that has a heart for you, Lord.

57:23.732 --> 57:25.233
Coach.

57:30.155 --> 57:33.699
- I'm proud of you, Matt.
- I need to talk with my dad.

57:33.867 --> 57:36.035
I'd like to go see him.

57:37.371 --> 57:39.413
I'll take you right now.

57:41.375 --> 57:44.210
So, what we've done here
is we've gained these four lots...

57:44.378 --> 57:46.420
... by moving the retention pond
down here.

57:46.588 --> 57:48.381
We could try
and do that through here.

57:48.549 --> 57:51.384
No. I like this. That's perfect.

57:51.552 --> 57:53.928
Mr. Prater, there's someone
here to see you.

57:54.096 --> 57:57.557
- Sarah, I'm in a meeting.
- It's your son.

57:58.642 --> 58:01.310
- Would you like me to step out?
- No, it's okay.

58:01.478 --> 58:03.521
Sarah, send him in.

58:09.153 --> 58:10.319
Matt, you okay?

58:10.988 --> 58:13.406
I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't know
you were in a meeting.

58:13.574 --> 58:14.657
What is it, son?

58:17.536 --> 58:20.746
Dad, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

58:21.707 --> 58:24.417
I'm sorry for the way
I've been acting.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.837
I got right with God today...

58:28.005 --> 58:31.716
... and I just needed to say
that from now on...

58:31.884 --> 58:34.218
... I’ll respect your authority.

58:34.386 --> 58:36.804
Whatever you say goes.

58:38.265 --> 58:39.849
That's it.

58:43.478 --> 58:45.271
You know,
I could come back tomorrow...

58:45.439 --> 58:47.064
... if that would be better for you.

58:47.232 --> 58:50.026
No. It's okay.

58:50.194 --> 58:52.361
I'm sorry. I...

59:06.293 --> 59:08.211
For what it's worth...

59:08.378 --> 59:12.298
... I'd give my right arm
to hear my son say that to me.

59:18.597 --> 59:20.932
I feel like I'm standing
before a new team tonight.

59:22.601 --> 59:24.310
It's a new day and a new game.

59:25.938 --> 59:29.982
What you've experienced in
your hearts is about to be released.

59:30.150 --> 59:32.401
Stay humble but confident.

59:33.820 --> 59:35.863
Why don't you take this one, Brock?

59:39.910 --> 59:42.787
Lord, we know our lives
are not about football...

59:42.955 --> 59:45.498
... but we do thank you
for allowing us to play tonight.

59:45.999 --> 59:47.792
Lord, we're gonna give you
our best.

59:47.960 --> 59:50.920
If we win, we'll praise you,
and if we lose, we'll praise you.

59:51.588 --> 59:55.091
We'll give you all the honor and
the glory for this night. Keep us safe.

59:55.259 --> 59:57.593
- Amen.
- Amen.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.179
All right, guys. Look at me.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.975
Play hard, have fun.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:10.898
Hit.

01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:31.085
Yeah.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.584
In the Old Testament,
Nehemiah had the task of building...

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:13.878
... a stone wall around his city
for protection.

01:01:14.046 --> 01:01:16.922
But he didn't have enough people
or resources or time.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.301
But because each person worked
on the wall in front of their house...

01:01:20.469 --> 01:01:23.471
... they got it done in record time.
That's what you're gonna do.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:27.725
On defense you have to resolve
nothing gets by you as an individual...

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:30.019
... nothing gets by us as a team.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.396
I need you to build me a stone wall.

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:43.866
Get on that, D.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:53.793
Yeah.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.113
Let's go. Let's go.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.574
Roll through there like you're
soul-struck. Come on, now.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:29.620
Come on. Hit somebody. I wanna see
some hitting. I wanna see hitting.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:32.039
Dig those feet. Come on,
you ain't on my team yet.

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:33.457
You're not on my defense.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:37.169
You gotta dig those feet. All right,
Prater. Get in there, boy. Let's go.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:39.338
You gotta hit him
a little harder than that.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:42.341
This ain't ballet practice.
This is football practice.

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:15.958
David.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:37.771
Double-sweep pitch lift. Pro 45 flex.
Man, even a 26 Powerhouse.

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:41.025
- Man, these are some good plays.
- We're gonna run them.

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:43.986
Man, we got all type of potential
on this sheet. When?

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.238
- We're gonna run them, I promise.
- Yeah, see?

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:48.574
You always tell me
you're gonna run them.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:50.993
- You don't wanna run my plays.
- Hey.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.244
It's all right.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:53.746
Where's my car?

01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:57.249
- Where'd you park it?
- Right here.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:01.045
You sure? Because there ain't no way
it got stolen.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:03.339
Man, you couldn't pay nobody
to steal your car.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:06.759
- Did the boys do something with it?
- Man, I don't know.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:10.095
Hey, man,
there's a note on this truck for you.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:14.058
- What does it say?
- Let's see.

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:17.478
It says, "Grant Taylor,
the impact you made on our school...

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:19.772
... means more to us
than you'll ever know.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.358
The Lord has used you
to meet a need in our lives...

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.485
... and now we want
to meet a need in yours.

01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:28.113
You'll find the title
of this new truck in your name.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:31.909
Please accept it
as our way of saying thank you. "

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:37.623
Somebody done gave you a truck?

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.882
Man, this title got your name on it.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.309
You got to be kidding me.

01:05:03.275 --> 01:05:07.695
Grant Taylor, somebody done
gave you a new truck.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:10.864
This is my truck?

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.009
Is this just
because you head coach?

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:32.386
Because I'm assistant coach.

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:36.307
You'd think I'd get a moped
out of this or something.

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:47.526
Oh, Lord, you've given me a truck.

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:52.740
Well, it's your truck. Drive it.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.037
Not a word to anyone.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:59.913
Yes, sir.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:11.592
That's right.
No more jumper cables.

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:15.804
Break.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:19.558
Brock. Brock.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:23.646
- You watch him. You watch him.
- Sure.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.230
Hut, hut.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.412
- Go.
- Go. Go.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:17.241
That's right. That's it, baby.
You got it, Brock.

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:19.785
That's right.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.807
- Yes, sir? Can I help you?
- Please.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:45.936
I'd like to buy a nice bouquet
of wildflowers for my wife.

01:07:46.104 --> 01:07:48.480
I see.
That's awfully sweet of you.

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:52.234
Oh, yes. I've got a special evening
in mind for her tonight.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:55.738
Well, in that case, you need a card
to go with those flowers, don't you?

01:07:55.905 --> 01:08:00.242
I've got the perfect one. I'm gonna give
it to her at her favorite restaurant.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.995
Oh, really? I'm sure she'll be happy.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:07.458
Oh, she will. So I need
your nicest, largest flowers...

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.626
... and money's no object.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:14.173
- You see, I got a raise today.
- You did?

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.760
- Six thousand dollars.
- Are you serious?

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.053
That's exactly the way
my wife's gonna respond.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:24.099
Grant.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:25.684
That's awesome.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:28.187
You know, you sure got
friendly service here.

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:38.947
Hello again, everybody. This is Lane
Lavarre, along with Dale Hansen...

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.783
... coming to you tonight
from Princeton Heights Academy...

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:45.162
... the site of tonight's opening round
of the GISA football playoffs.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.038
For the first time in a decade...

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:49.792
... the Shiloh Eagles
find themselves in postseason play.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:52.377
Coach Grant Taylor's
gonna have his hands full...

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.839
... as he takes on the Panthers
who haven't lost a game all season.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:09:00.301
All right, huddle up. Stay sharp, stay
focused, play hard and honor God.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.888
- Eagles on three. One, two, three.
- Eagles.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.975
Sweep.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.135
So after an impressive
seven-and-three record...

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:46.014
... the Shiloh Eagles fall short tonight
in the first round of the GISA playoffs.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.724
Twenty-eight to 10 is the score.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:50.853
The Princeton Heights Panthers
take it to the Shiloh Eagles.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.773
I knew we were gonna
get killed tonight.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:11.582
Your effort was good tonight.
You've got nothing to be ashamed of.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:17.963
You played hard.

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:21.049
The Shilohs had the best season
they've had in a long time.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.468
God's been good to us this year.

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:32.394
Guys, coach is right.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:36.481
We're gonna praise God when we win,
we're gonna praise him when we lose.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.236
Let's take a knee.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:59.796
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:07.471
I wish by some miracle
we could have won tonight.

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:11.558
They worked too hard
to walk away with their heads down.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:18.440
You know, I was hoping God would
give us just one win in the playoffs.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.695
They deserved it.

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:33.664
You know, if you'd told me
two months ago...

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:36.583
... that we'd be playing
Princeton Heights in the playoffs...

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.877
- ... I would not have believed you.
- Yeah.

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:42.714
If you'd told me our school was having
a revival, I wouldn't have believed you.

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:45.300
- This ain't been a bad year.
- Got all the jerseys?

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:48.220
All 32 of them. But I ain't ready
to put them up, though.

01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:50.097
I'm ready to go another round.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:53.225
You and me both.
Part of me wanted to get to state.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:57.646
- To state? Grant, are you serious?
- Why not? As hard as they worked?

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:00.732
Well, working hard is one thing,
but to take this team to state?

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.152
- That'd take an act of God.
- Has he not been acting already?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.073
He has, but do you know who's gonna
be waiting for whoever gets to state?

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:10.909
- The Richland Giants.
- That's right, the Richland Giants.

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:13.787
And Bobby Lee Duke will be there
with his 85 players...

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:18.166
... ready to spank whoever made it
to the state playoffs to kingdom come.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.919
- I'm not afraid.
- I know you're not afraid.

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.254
Because you ain't going.

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:25.215
Oh, by the way, man, some man called
looking for you today.

01:12:25.383 --> 01:12:26.591
Who?

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.844
Stan Shultz.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:30.595
- Stan Shultz?
- Yeah.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.349
Stan Shultz.
Isn't that the cartoonist?

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.268
That's Charles Schulz.

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:39.521
I thought Charles Schulz was that man
that flew across the ocean...

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.148
... in the Spirit of St. Andrew.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:44.234
That's Charles Lindbergh,
and it was the Spirit of St. Louis.

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:47.612
- No, Lindbergh is a cheese.
- Limburger's the cheese.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.905
Lindbergh's the man.

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:53.410
No, Lindbergh was that blimp that
blew up and killed all them people.

01:12:54.746 --> 01:12:57.122
That's the Hindenburg.

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:02.961
No, Hindenburg is where
you go skiing in Tennessee.

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:05.797
- That's Gatlinburg.
- Gatlinburg?

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:09.301
You mean like the country music
group, the Gatlinburg Brothers?

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.388
You guys are crazy.

01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:16.683
Grant Taylor.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:21.063
Well, Mr. Shultz,
I was told you were looking for me.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.023
Yes.

01:13:23.191 --> 01:13:25.734
Am I sitting down?
Why do you ask?

01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:30.822
Hey, coach, what's going on here?

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.824
Coach is on his way
to let us all know.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:34.659
All right.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.164
All right, everybody. Bring it in.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:45.962
I want you to know
I serve a big God...

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.131
... and he can do whatever
he wants to do.

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:50.842
He can open what he wants to
and shut what he wants to.

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:53.011
A team that plays
for his honor and glory...

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:55.305
... will have his blessings
following that team.

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:59.601
Unlike those who try to cheat their way
to the top, like Princeton Heights did...

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.312
... when they played
two ineligible 19-year-olds.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.482
They have been disqualified
and we're advancing to the next round.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.859
Get your pads on for practice, boys.

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:10.320
We're going to war
with Tucker Friday night.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:22.374
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the GISA quarterfinals.

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:26.044
Who would have thought we'd be
seeing the Shiloh Eagles tonight...

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:28.130
... in a contest
against the Tucker Tigers?

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.048
With Princeton Heights disqualified...

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:32.801
... call this an early Christmas present
for Shiloh.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.762
Offense, put it in the end zone.
Defense, build me a wall.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:38.473
- Eagles on three. One, two, three.
- Eagles.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.772
Blue, 18. Blue, 18.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.859
Set. Hit. Hit.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:12.591
David.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:16.595
This is your field goal.
It belongs to you. Put it through.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.847
We're putting David in.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:24.686
David.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:28.523
Hit.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.486
Yeah.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:36.781
There you go. There you go.

01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:39.534
The Tucker Tigers
are nursing their wounds...

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:41.536
... as they face
the end of their season.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.623
The Eagles, however,
have a little farther to fly.

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:48.001
All right, what kind of sick
are we talking about?

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:51.254
I don't know. I've just felt really
nauseous the last two mornings.

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:55.133
- And then I feel fine again.
- You haven't eaten anything weird?

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:57.427
Not unless fruit and cereal's weird.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:02.349
Brooke, my gut says make
an appointment with the doctor.

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:06.895
I've been there three times this year.
It's getting embarrassing.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:10.273
I'm just telling you what I would do.
You can even use my car.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:18.698
With five seconds left, the score
still stands in Oakhaven's favor...

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:20.867
... 17 to 14 over the Eagles.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.161
Grant Taylor calls the play in
to Zach Avery...

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:26.665
... who pulls the huddle together
for their last shot at going to state.

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:30.293
It's third down and goal for the Eagles
and the crowd is going crazy.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.797
They line up in an I formation.
This is do or die for the Eagles.

01:16:33.965 --> 01:16:37.676
Zach takes the snap and will give it
to Jacob Hall for-- No, it's a fake.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:41.179
He's got Nathan Markle open in the
corner. The pass is up. He's got it.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:44.474
Touchdown Eagles.
Touchdown Eagles.

01:16:44.642 --> 01:16:46.893
Zach Avery completely
faked out the defense...

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.896
... and made a perfect pass
to win the game 20 to 17.

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:51.439
Can you believe this?

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:55.527
The Shiloh Eagles are actually
headed to the state championship.

01:16:55.695 --> 01:17:00.490
A team with only 32 players
has made it to the big dance. Oh, my.

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:03.535
On the eve of the GISA
football state championship...

01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:06.579
... the Richland Giants
prepare to defend their reign...

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:08.039
... as lords of the gridiron.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.417
It's no surprise
they've returned for this game.

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:13.712
What is surprising is who
they're playing. The Shiloh Eagles...

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:17.090
... who started the season oh and
three, have come out of nowhere...

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:19.676
... and through a bizarre
set of circumstances...

01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:22.554
... now face a team
almost three times their size.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:34.399
Sleep at all last night?

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:38.236
Are you nervous?

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:40.780
It's a weird emotion.

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:43.742
Part of me thinks
we're gonna get crushed tonight...

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:47.245
... part of me thinks
God may do something awesome.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:50.540
Sounds like your fear's
about to clobber your faith.

01:17:52.752 --> 01:17:54.586
Something like that.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.172
When are you going out there?

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:59.924
I might leave early,
if that's all right.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.761
Just don't worry about me.
I'll just meet you at the game.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:04.429
Okay.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.559
Either way, you're still playing
for a state championship.

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:22.822
Juice. There's some juice.

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.617
Do you see that?

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.579
This is?

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.041
- Apple.
- Apple. Good.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:35.627
- Where's the duck?
- Duck.

01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:38.254
- Zebra.
- Zebra.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:40.298
Zebra. Cat.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.175
Duck.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:45.804
There's the pig.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:48.139
Brooke Taylor's here again.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:51.309
Maybe she'll be pregnant this time.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.520
I hope so.

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:59.109
- You ready, son?
- I can't find my cleats.

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:00.985
They're right here by the door.

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:03.154
Thanks.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.577
You realize you're playing
for the state championship tonight?

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:12.497
I don't know why I'm so nervous.
I'm not even gonna play.

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:15.458
You know I'm proud of you,
don't you?

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:16.668
Yes, sir.

01:19:16.836 --> 01:19:19.546
Don't ever doubt it.
Whether you play or not...

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:22.674
- ... I'll be right there praying for you.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:25.969
Let's go pick a fight
with some giants.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:31.307
Here's the results for B Taylor.

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:33.518
Oh, I'll take that.

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:39.732
- Negative?
- Yes.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:48.092
I will still love you, Lord.

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:53.389
I will still love you.

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:19.809
All right, God. You got us here.

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:23.062
Whatever happens,
may you get the glory.

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:40.204
- Coach, what are you doing here?
- You're at the state championship.

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:43.249
Any time a former player gets this far,
you know I'd be there.

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:46.336
- It blows me away.
- Well, how you feeling?

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.297
A little bit nervous.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:52.050
This championship,
it's kind of surreal for me.

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:55.219
I promise you, I don't care
what level of ball you're coaching...

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:58.181
... it's surreal when you make it
to the championship game.

01:22:58.349 --> 01:23:01.476
And Grant, I can tell you, I'm so proud
of you and what you've done.

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:04.354
I've been reading about the team
and where you've gone.

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:08.775
And I'm just proud of the fact that you
finally learned how to win the big one.

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:12.362
- We haven't played them yet.
- You won when you accepted Christ.

01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:15.406
Now, as you're teaching
these guys and minister to them...

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:17.158
... I think it's just fantastic.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:20.495
I got it. These players got it.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:24.332
Well, I can promise you, win or lose
this game, you guys are champions.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.584
- I appreciate that.
- But while you're here...

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.544
... you might as well win it, huh?

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:32.507
I'm gonna try my best. You know,
this team we're playing, they're huge.

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:36.010
They're fast, they're strong. I just don't
want my players to be afraid.

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:42.433
Well, in God's word, he said
365 different times, "Do not fear. "

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:46.270
If he says it that many times, you know
he's serious about it, don't you?

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:48.773
I would guess so.
I needed to hear that.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.776
Well, look, you're gonna do
great tonight. I know you're busy.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:54.278
- I'm gonna go and cheer you on.
- Good to see you.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:57.240
- All right. God bless you, man.
- Thanks, coach.

01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:17.802
In about five minutes
we head out for the warm-up.

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:20.221
I wanna say two things.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:23.141
Number one,
I love you and I'm proud of you.

01:24:24.435 --> 01:24:27.395
I wouldn't trade this season
for anything in the world.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:32.150
Secondly, you're about to play
the biggest team you've ever faced.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:35.528
They're strong, fast and undefeated.

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:38.156
So far.

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:41.951
But I want you to remember
where God has brought us.

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:44.746
I want you to remember
how hard you've worked.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:48.750
We weren't supposed to have
a winning season, but we do.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.003
We weren't supposed to advance
through the playoffs, but we did.

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:56.299
We're not supposed to be here,
but we are.

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:59.761
So if anything in you says
this is a losing effort, throw it out.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:03.097
Because as I stand here, I believe
that as long as we honor God...

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:05.516
... nothing is impossible.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.144
Nothing.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:14.650
Leave everything out on the field.
Give your best to God tonight.

01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:19.572
Whether we leave the field the victors
or not, we will give God the glory.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:22.074
Now...

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.661
... who will go fight
the Giants with me?

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:55.233
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.586
The Giants elect to receive
after the coin toss.

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:18.422
We're just seconds away from
the state championship game.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.676
Dale, it is impressive
that Shiloh has made it this far...

01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:24.428
... but the field tonight
really looks lopsided.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:25.638
It definitely does.

01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:28.307
I'm looking at 85 players
on the Richland sidelines...

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:30.434
... as opposed to 32 for Shiloh.

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:34.272
Even if the Eagles had great talent,
they can't bring in fresh players.

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:36.691
That's really gonna hurt
in the second half.

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:39.110
All right. Let's go, Joshua.

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.283
The Eagles kick it off and the state
championship game is underway.

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:48.369
Jerod House will receive the kick
and he'll head down the field.

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:51.122
He gets a couple blocks
and breaks outside. He's got daylight.

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:54.292
But the Eagles will take him down
around the 50-yard line.

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:56.294
That's where the Giants
will set up shop.

01:26:56.461 --> 01:27:00.423
First down and in good field position
to start this state championship game.

01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:02.884
Get up there.
Brock, watch them up the middle.

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.636
Come on. Let's go, boys.

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:09.056
Wes Porter will call the play
for the Giants. He steps back to pass.

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:12.435
He's got Damien Fuller streaking
down the sideline. He lets it fly.

01:27:12.603 --> 01:27:15.897
Fuller will take the pass in, he will
race into the end zone untouched.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:19.400
And the Giants strike early here
in the game with the first score.

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:22.278
Welcome to
state-championship football.

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:24.155
Hey, man, this is a whole new level.

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:26.657
They are quick off the line.
We've gotta stay back.

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:29.619
The Eagles will start this drive
at the 19-yard line.

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:32.747
Zach Avery drops back to pass
and he passes to Jeremy Johnson.

01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:34.957
But the pass is batted down
by the Giants.

01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:37.543
That's right. That's the way we do it.

01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:40.421
Avery hands it to Jacob Hall,
who tries to run up...

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:44.008
... but he gets absolutely nowhere
as he is swamped by defenders.

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:51.849
Ten, 10, hit, hit.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.478
Eagles look to pass.
Here come the Giants.

01:27:55.646 --> 01:27:57.897
They're gonna get the sack.
That's gonna force the Eagles...

01:27:58.065 --> 01:28:01.108
... into a punting situation
on fourth down.

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:03.319
Baby, ain't that pretty?

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:10.201
Jerod House will receive the kick
and he'll head down the field.

01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:13.913
He breaks outside.
He's got some daylight.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.979
Okay. All right, time-- Ref, timeout.

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.857
After gaining eight yards,
the Eagles give up another sack.

01:28:42.025 --> 01:28:44.276
They're gonna have to punt it away
on fourth down.

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.153
Dale, so far it's been all Richland.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:49.991
- I should not have called that play.
- They're all over us. Nobody's open.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.702
- They're knocking us around.
- They're getting cocky.

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:56.205
We cannot let them play their game.
Defense, blitz on first down.

01:28:56.373 --> 01:28:59.083
We've gotta get them off their rhythm.
Let's go.

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:26.610
No.

01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:42.001
Field-goal unit.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:44.295
Good job. Good job.
Keep it up.

01:29:44.463 --> 01:29:46.881
What universe are you in?
Get in the game.

01:29:52.304 --> 01:29:54.472
So with a few seconds left
in the first half...

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:57.141
... the Giants were gonna
take a three-touchdown lead...

01:29:57.309 --> 01:30:00.811
... but after an Eagles interception,
we've got a 14 to 7 football game.

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:09.612
We can't keep running our normal
plays. Their defense is killing us.

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:14.158
I agree. We cannot outmuscle them
and we cannot outrun them.

01:30:14.326 --> 01:30:16.243
We've gotta outsmart them.

01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:19.663
- Trick plays?
- Just enough to keep them guessing.

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:21.332
You see another way?

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.417
You just can't use them
too often, though.

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:26.504
- They catch on, we toast.
- We're toast if we don't put points...

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:29.173
... on that board. We gotta make it
through the fourth.

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:31.008
And they got a deep bench.

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:35.971
We're still in the game. Good job on
the defense getting us on the board.

01:30:36.139 --> 01:30:38.265
I believe they thought
this would be a shutout.

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:39.975
We're gonna keep surprising them.

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:43.104
You've figured out they've got power
and speed, they're big...

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:45.106
... but they're also predictable.

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.941
We have gotta stay together.

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:51.904
We can't outrun them,
but we can outsmart them.

01:30:53.156 --> 01:30:56.951
With the Giants leading 14 to 7, we
get set to bring you the second half...

01:30:57.119 --> 01:30:58.661
... of this championship game.

01:30:58.829 --> 01:31:02.498
And unless the Eagles find a way to
solve Richland's size and strength...

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:06.544
... the Giants could very well be taking
home their fourth state title tonight.

01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:13.634
Make it work, Zach.

01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:21.559
The Eagles come out
with a little trickery.

01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:24.395
And they're just about to tie
this football game.

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:35.489
Hustle, hustle. Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:38.242
Make them pay, boys.
Make them pay.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:45.875
Come on. That was dirty.

01:31:49.296 --> 01:31:51.589
He's hurt. He's hurt. He's hurt.

01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:59.597
Joshua Webster's
being helped off the field...

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:02.641
... with what we have been told is
a broken collarbone.

01:32:02.809 --> 01:32:06.854
That came after a late hit by the
Giants after the Eagles tied the game.

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:08.981
- Stupid. That was dirty.
- Calm down.

01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:11.609
This is a new ball game.
Joshua's gonna be all right.

01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:15.029
David, come here.
You gotta cover for Joshua now.

01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:16.947
- I need 110 percent.
- All right, coach.

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:18.949
Be the man. Kickoff team. Let's go.

01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:38.802
After a long drive, the Giants score.
The Eagles prevent the conversion...

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:41.055
... leaving this
a 20 to 14 football game.

01:32:41.223 --> 01:32:44.725
Why are they on the scoreboard?
They shouldn't even be in this game.

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:47.269
For the rest of your life,
you will remember today.

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:50.773
I want you to remember you held
nothing back, you did not lose heart...

01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:53.317
... you did not stop fighting,
you did not quit.

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:56.153
They're like little dogs
nipping at your heels.

01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:58.489
Now get out there and stomp them.

01:33:02.661 --> 01:33:05.329
That's what I'm talking about.
That's my defense.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:09.833
Let's go, Eagles.
He's going for a bomb.

01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:14.004
Let's go. He's going for a bomb.
Don't get beat. Go.

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:19.385
The Eagles have shown
the determination...

01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:21.178
... of a school twice their size.

01:33:21.346 --> 01:33:26.183
The Giants will now attempt a 35-yard
field goal to extend their lead.

01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:30.688
That is the last time
we go for a field goal.

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:33.232
We should be in the end zone
every stinking time.

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:37.361
Double flex wall. Double flex wall.

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:48.539
And hit.

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:57.715
Go. Go. Go.

01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:04.513
What are you doing?

01:34:04.681 --> 01:34:07.224
Field-goal unit.
Go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:10.728
- Let's go.
- Good job. All right. That's my team.

01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:14.231
Coach, I need a rest.
I can't go much more.

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:17.651
I need you on that field. You have
gotta stay in the game. I need you.

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:18.902
Yes, sir.

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:21.238
David Childers is in to kick
for Joshua Webster.

01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:25.743
We understand this is his first season.
He's gone three for four this season.

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:28.746
Looking at the stats, he's been limited
to short-range kicks.

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:31.832
Come on, David. You got this.

01:34:50.727 --> 01:34:52.269
Yeah.

01:34:57.067 --> 01:34:59.777
Timeout, ref. Ref, timeout.

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:04.948
Coach, I'm done.
Someone else has gotta lead.

01:35:05.116 --> 01:35:08.118
Brock, this is when it matters most.
I know you're tired.

01:35:08.286 --> 01:35:10.079
It's easy to lead when you're strong.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:12.122
But now is when you lead us,
right now.

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:15.876
Can you give me four more downs?
I just need four more downs.

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:18.212
Four more.

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.880
All right, come here. Come here.

01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:23.258
This is our time and you've got
to put the nails in the coffin.

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:26.970
Look at me. We didn't fight this far
to give up in the last quarter.

01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:28.639
Leave everything on the field.

01:35:28.807 --> 01:35:31.058
And field goals, they're not an option.

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:33.727
I need you for four more downs.
Who's with me?

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:35.813
Now get out there and get it done.

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:38.982
With less than two minutes left,
the Giants stand on the verge...

01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:41.819
... of their fourth-straight
consecutive state title.

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:46.240
A tired Eagles team lines up
to face them yet again.

01:35:48.952 --> 01:35:51.286
Stone wall. Stone wall.

01:35:51.454 --> 01:35:53.664
Yes. Stone wall.

01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:55.332
- Stone wall.
- Stone wall.

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.252
Stone wall. Stone wall.

01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:02.589
The Giants line up first and goal. This
score will solidify the championship.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:05.175
Hand the-- No, wait a minute.
He is stopped.

01:36:05.343 --> 01:36:09.012
The Eagles are still in it, showing
determination to fight this one out.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.514
Three more downs.

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:15.018
- Three more.
- Yeah.

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:16.645
You gotta hang with me.

01:36:16.813 --> 01:36:19.857
I know it's getting tough.
We gotta stop them here.

01:36:20.024 --> 01:36:22.359
It's second down
and goal to go for the Giants.

01:36:22.527 --> 01:36:24.319
The state title is within their grasp.

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:28.240
Both of the stands are on their feet
as they get ready to run this play.

01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:32.619
Wes Porter will take it. No,
the Eagles have stopped him again.

01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:35.372
That's my team. That's my team.

01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:40.711
Come on. Get it in the end zone.

01:36:40.879 --> 01:36:42.504
Two more.

01:36:42.672 --> 01:36:45.632
And here we go again.
They're gonna try it again.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.553
Wes Porter will take the snap.
He's looking to pass into the corner.

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:53.891
But the Eagles bat down the pass.
The crowd is going nuts right now.

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:57.394
The Giants have been kept out of
the end zone on three straight plays.

01:36:57.562 --> 01:37:00.189
Now Bobby Lee Duke
will have a big decision to make.

01:37:00.356 --> 01:37:04.818
- We have gotta go for a field goal.
- We are not going for a field goal.

01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:11.742
He's not kicking it. Brock. Brock.
One more down. One more down.

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:15.913
It's fourth down and the Giants
are going for the touchdown.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.707
This crowd is going
absolutely berserk right now.

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:22.586
They line up at the one-yard line.
Wes Porter's gonna take the snap.

01:37:22.754 --> 01:37:26.715
Brock Kelley's gonna meet him
head-on. And there's a fumble.

01:37:27.467 --> 01:37:30.385
The Eagles have the football.
They're taking it down the field.

01:37:30.553 --> 01:37:32.846
He's at the 40. He's at the 50.

01:37:33.014 --> 01:37:37.434
He's at the 40. He'll be run out at the
34-yard line. Are you believing this?

01:37:37.602 --> 01:37:41.563
With two seconds left, the Eagles
have got a shot at this football game.

01:37:47.612 --> 01:37:50.906
- We've got time for a Hail Mary.
- The defense is too strong.

01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:53.742
No, we can't run it.
That's our only option.

01:37:54.536 --> 01:37:55.744
You gotta kick it, man.

01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:59.289
David.

01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:01.208
I need a 51 -yard field goal.

01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:04.336
- I can't kick that far.
- They've stopped the pass all night.

01:38:04.504 --> 01:38:07.589
- You're my best option.
- The furthest I've kicked is a 39.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:09.967
There is no way
I can kick a 51 -yard field goal.

01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:13.262
I believe you can. Do the best you can.
Leave the results to God.

01:38:13.429 --> 01:38:14.721
I need you on that field.

01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:17.307
Field-goal unit.

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:20.477
Grant, we've gotta throw it.
He can't kick it. It's too far.

01:38:20.645 --> 01:38:23.230
- No, it's not.
- What are you doing?

01:38:23.398 --> 01:38:25.482
I'm preparing for rain.

01:38:26.192 --> 01:38:28.652
I don't understand,
but with two seconds left...

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:31.363
... the Eagles are putting the game
in the hands...

01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:33.240
... of a 145-pound backup kicker.

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:36.660
This is not a good move.
He even has to kick into the wind.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:43.959
David.

01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:47.713
He's not ready.
He don't think he can do it.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.800
I don't have any more timeouts.
Call a timeout, Bobby Lee.

01:38:51.968 --> 01:38:55.012
- This kid can't kick that far.
- Call that timeout.

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:58.015
Call a timeout anyway
and let's ice him.

01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:04.354
David, come here.

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:08.191
You're telling yourself
you're gonna miss.

01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:09.526
It's too far.

01:39:09.694 --> 01:39:13.196
Listen to me. Do you think
God could help you make this kick?

01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:16.033
- Do you believe it, David?
- Yeah, if he wants to.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.869
So do I. Give him your best
and leave the rest up to him.

01:39:19.037 --> 01:39:21.204
Will you do that for me?

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:32.633
Make this field goal or not,
we're gonna praise him.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.386
But don't you walk off this field
having done any less than your best.

01:39:56.366 --> 01:39:58.408
- Can I help you?
- Don't touch me.

01:39:58.576 --> 01:40:00.202
I'm standing for my son.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:05.999
God, help me make this kick.

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:14.508
Kick it now. Kick it now.

01:40:14.676 --> 01:40:16.385
Hit.

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:27.187
The kick is up. It's on its way.
It's long enough. It's high enough.

01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:30.774
Does it have the distance? It does.
It's good. It's good. It's good.

01:40:30.942 --> 01:40:32.984
The Eagles have won
the championship.

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:34.277
Thank you, God.

01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:38.281
I can't believe what I've just seen.
I cannot believe what I've just seen.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:40.367
A miracle has occurred here tonight.

01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:44.746
The Shiloh Eagles have defeated
the Richland Giants 24 to 23...

01:40:44.914 --> 01:40:47.874
... to take the state title
for the first time in their history.

01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:50.961
It's incredible.
It's absolutely unbelievable.

01:40:52.964 --> 01:40:56.133
You are a state champion.
You are a state champion.

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:29.249
All right. You guys,
who's the state champions?

01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:38.842
Okay. Okay.

01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:40.969
I got something to say.

01:41:41.846 --> 01:41:43.263
David Childers.

01:41:48.352 --> 01:41:51.354
Don't you ever let anyone tell you
that you're under par...

01:41:51.522 --> 01:41:53.857
... second-rate or inferior.

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:58.653
I just watched God
do a miracle through you.

01:41:58.821 --> 01:42:04.201
I saw a field of Giants,
85 of them to be exact, fall in defeat.

01:42:04.368 --> 01:42:06.578
Now you tell me
what's impossible with God.

01:42:06.746 --> 01:42:08.038
Nothing, coach.

01:42:10.458 --> 01:42:13.168
Zach, I just watched you
and the offense do...

01:42:13.336 --> 01:42:15.045
... what they said could not be done.

01:42:15.213 --> 01:42:17.172
Now you tell me what's impossible
with God.

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.341
Nothing, coach.

01:42:19.509 --> 01:42:22.886
Brock, how about it?
You built that stone wall, didn't you?

01:42:23.054 --> 01:42:24.513
And it stood.

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.098
Now you tell me what's impossible
with God.

01:42:27.266 --> 01:42:28.433
Nothing, coach.

01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:31.228
- Scott, what's impossible with God?
- Nothing.

01:42:31.395 --> 01:42:35.065
Are you sure? Those Giants are big.
They outnumber us three to one.

01:42:35.233 --> 01:42:37.484
Are you sure there's
nothing impossible with God?

01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:39.402
I'm sure, coach.

01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:42.823
- Nathan, what's impossible with God?
- Nothing, coach.

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.534
- Jonathan?
- Nothing.

01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:48.078
- Are you positive?
- Positive, coach.

01:42:48.246 --> 01:42:51.748
So am I. So am I.

01:42:51.916 --> 01:42:54.793
God can do whatever he wants to do,
however he wants to do it.

01:42:54.961 --> 01:42:57.629
And he chooses to work in our lives
because he loves us...

01:42:57.797 --> 01:42:58.839
... because he's good.

01:43:00.049 --> 01:43:04.719
Hope today's a milestone for what
he can do for the rest of your life...

01:43:04.887 --> 01:43:06.596
... if you trust him.

01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:09.933
Why don't we spend some time
thanking him?

01:43:27.285 --> 01:43:30.036
Well, look who just walked
in this house.

01:43:30.454 --> 01:43:33.999
Couldn't be the state-champion coach
Grant Taylor, could it?

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:36.710
Because he's not supposed
to live here.

01:43:36.878 --> 01:43:38.879
He's supposed to be out
looking for a job.

01:43:40.506 --> 01:43:42.424
God did it, Brooke.

01:43:44.176 --> 01:43:45.719
He did it.

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:50.140
He gave me this job...

01:43:52.685 --> 01:43:55.270
... provided for our needs...

01:43:55.438 --> 01:43:57.439
... took away my fear.

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:02.235
He throws in the state championship
just because he can.

01:44:08.159 --> 01:44:10.785
It's been one of the best days
of my life.

01:44:11.537 --> 01:44:15.665
- The day's not over yet.
- What do you mean?

01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:22.505
Grant Taylor, I just want you to know
that you've made the team.

01:44:23.674 --> 01:44:25.342
What team?

01:44:28.054 --> 01:44:30.221
The daddy team.

01:44:33.559 --> 01:44:35.560
We're gonna have a baby?

01:44:35.728 --> 01:44:38.521
We're gonna have a baby.

01:44:45.988 --> 01:44:48.490
You tell me, Coach Taylor...

01:44:48.658 --> 01:44:53.828
... tell me what's impossible
when God's on your side?

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:59.876
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm overwhelmed.
