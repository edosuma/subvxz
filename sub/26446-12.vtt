00:03.482 --> 00:06.851
Okay, who want to try
this new drink I created?

00:06.852 --> 00:09.320
Jake, what is that called?

00:09.321 --> 00:12.223
S... Smoky alcohol?

00:13.825 --> 00:16.460
Smells like gasoline.

00:16.461 --> 00:18.929
It got a little bit of that in it.

00:20.032 --> 00:22.099
Dang, that was quick.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.168
Yo, is that vision board party
over already?

00:24.169 --> 00:26.137
No, Rel started roasting everybody

00:26.138 --> 00:28.205
and got us kicked out halfway through.

00:28.206 --> 00:30.374
Okay, come on, now. No, no,
I wasn't roasting anybody.

00:30.375 --> 00:31.942
I was just pointing out the obvious.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.711
One girl had flat irons,
kitchen knives

00:33.712 --> 00:36.048
and a foot massager
on her vision board.

00:36.049 --> 00:37.481
You shouldn't be able
to create a vision

00:37.482 --> 00:40.284
with just a trip to the drug store.

00:40.285 --> 00:42.653
Okay, someone give me a hint.
What-what is a vision board?

00:42.654 --> 00:45.015
You cut out pictures of things
you aspire to,

00:45.016 --> 00:47.355
and then you glue them on a
board to keep your mind focused

00:47.356 --> 00:48.764
on where you want your life to go.

00:48.765 --> 00:50.699
Oh, so you got grown people
taking pictures,

00:50.700 --> 00:53.102
cutting 'em out of a magazine,
sticking it on cardboard,

00:53.103 --> 00:54.870
and hoping a miracle will happen.

00:54.871 --> 00:57.139
That's called voodoo.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.608
Look, one girl brought
her vision board that she had

00:59.609 --> 01:03.178
from last year because
none of her visions came true.

01:03.179 --> 01:05.864
And look, everybody was sitting
there like it wasn't sad.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.065
That was weird to me.

01:07.066 --> 01:09.384
That's what being
a supportive friend is called.

01:09.386 --> 01:12.154
You know... how I <i>act</i> like your
life ain't sad all the time?

01:12.155 --> 01:14.490
Whatever, whatever, whatever.
My board is simple.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.025
- I got everything I want on mine.
- DAD: But Rel,

01:17.027 --> 01:19.361
this don't make no sense.
You already got them kids.

01:19.362 --> 01:21.029
They just live in Cleveland.

01:21.031 --> 01:23.398
That's what I told him.
See, you get how it work, Milt.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.933
I most certainly do not.

01:27.404 --> 01:29.938
Oh, yeah, let me take this call.

01:29.939 --> 01:32.107
Wait. So, Britt, like,
what's on your board?

01:32.108 --> 01:34.343
Look, I divided mine
into three areas...

01:34.344 --> 01:36.111
career, dreams and love life.

01:36.112 --> 01:39.581
For my career, I would love for
my fashion line to go national.

01:39.582 --> 01:42.050
Dreams: I dream about
my fashion line going national.

01:42.052 --> 01:44.353
And my love life...

01:44.354 --> 01:46.989
I'd love my life if
my fashion line went national.

01:52.562 --> 01:55.063
she said Erica got suspended.

For what... winning
- too many spelling bees?

01:57.434 --> 01:59.801
- (CHUCKLES)
- No. Apparently,

01:59.803 --> 02:01.970
she made fun
of a girl with a disability.

02:01.971 --> 02:03.739
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Hold it.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.974
This-this Shannon calling back.
Let me take this outside.

02:05.975 --> 02:08.076
Whoa, whoa. Look, check this out.

02:08.078 --> 02:11.446
Rel put a picture of his kids
on the board, right?

02:11.448 --> 02:14.950
And now he outside talking
to Shannon <i>about</i> his kids.

02:14.951 --> 02:17.052

02:18.888 --> 02:21.456
Man, I don't believe in vision boards.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.025
But I got a dream catcher

02:23.026 --> 02:25.527
that's filled almost entirely

sweet, smart, quiet Erica

02:42.846 --> 02:44.813
would make fun of somebody
with a disability.

02:44.814 --> 02:47.416

Oh, hell, no.

Uh-oh. You got that look in your eyes.

03:47.110 --> 03:48.644

you would spend the rest

into your old patterns,

Oh.

So, why-why did you say that?

05:57.307 --> 05:58.774
She called me "Stinky Butt."

about the three finger part?

to see your face in person

06:34.510 --> 06:35.944
you got a kid with three fingers,

06:35.945 --> 06:37.479
you got to let them know,

"Look, you can't be talking
about people."

come on.

a really big deal.

06:51.060 --> 06:53.328

how to handle this.

06:54.770 --> 06:57.032
you can't go right after the
three, you know what I mean?

06:57.033 --> 06:58.967
Or we can just teach her coping skills

06:58.968 --> 07:01.203
on how to deal
with being teased. Real simple.

07:01.204 --> 07:04.439

defend yourself, right?

the bigger person,

Now, look, here's the thing, though.

08:49.082 --> 08:51.083
You can't go at the disabilities,

08:51.084 --> 08:53.185
or talk about something
a person can't change.

I remember when I was
in school and this kid,

08:57.691 --> 08:59.458
you know, was-was calling me
"four eyes."

08:59.459 --> 09:02.494
I was like, "Well, the only
reason I got these glasses on

09:02.495 --> 09:04.730
is to block your bad breath
from giving me pink eye."

09:04.731 --> 09:06.398
And the next thing you do,
all you got to do is

09:06.399 --> 09:08.000
add an act-out to that,
and you're good.

09:08.001 --> 09:09.568
What's an act-out?

09:09.569 --> 09:11.170
Oh, an act-out is when

09:11.171 --> 09:12.905
you actually act out the joke
you said, right?

09:12.906 --> 09:14.440
I'll give you a perfect example,
right?

09:14.441 --> 09:15.974
This mean kid who used to pick on me

09:15.976 --> 09:17.409
had on some dirty Jordans one day.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.478
And I was like,
"Your-Your Jordans are so dirty,

09:19.479 --> 09:21.413
"Michael Jordan's not holding
a basketball anymore.

09:21.414 --> 09:23.816
He's holding a washcloth." And
then I started doing like this.

09:23.817 --> 09:25.250
And everybody started dying laughing.

09:25.252 --> 09:27.152
(LAUGHING)

09:27.153 --> 09:29.121
And that's all you got to do,
you know?

09:29.122 --> 09:31.156
As a matter of fact,
let's-let's... let's practice.

09:31.157 --> 09:32.991
Look at this pillow.

09:32.993 --> 09:35.160
Pretend this pillow is Lisa Maxwell.

09:35.161 --> 09:37.329
That's right, that mean girl
that talked about you.

09:37.330 --> 09:39.665
And she said your butt stinks. Go.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.900
You only know my butt is stinky

09:41.901 --> 09:44.269
because you like to sniff butts. Hmm.

09:44.271 --> 09:46.438
(CHUCKLING) I mean, that is funny,

09:46.439 --> 09:49.808
but, uh, you're also admitting
that your butt stinks.

09:49.809 --> 09:51.477
So...

09:51.478 --> 09:53.011
it's a win-loss situation.

09:55.749 --> 09:57.750
How about this, Dad?

09:57.751 --> 10:00.419
Your shirt is so dirty,
I almost gave you a quarter

10:00.420 --> 10:01.854
when I saw you this morning.

10:01.855 --> 10:03.455
(CHUCKLING)

10:03.456 --> 10:05.391
All right, look,
that's not bad, but, you know,

10:05.392 --> 10:07.693
you don't know
this kid's financial situation.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.828
20 years ago, you know,
poverty wasn't off-limits.

10:09.829 --> 10:12.231
You know, right now you got
to factor in the socioeconomics,

10:12.232 --> 10:14.032
you know what I mean?

10:14.034 --> 10:16.034
Ew, what are you eating for lunch?

10:16.036 --> 10:18.504
It smells like bubbling hot garbage.

10:18.505 --> 10:22.641
Well, your outfit is so weird
that they cancelled picture day.

10:22.642 --> 10:25.043
(CHUCKLING) Good job!

10:25.045 --> 10:26.979
Okay, look,
you've been doing great today,

10:26.980 --> 10:28.847
but this is your last test.

10:28.848 --> 10:32.818
Roast your dad. Come on, hit me.

10:32.819 --> 10:34.653
Your breath's so bad

10:34.654 --> 10:38.524
that your family moved
all the way to Cleveland.

10:38.525 --> 10:40.692
Damn, girl. (CLEARS THROAT, SNIFFLES)

10:40.694 --> 10:43.028
Okay, I didn't know
you was gonna go that low,

10:43.029 --> 10:45.197
uh, but it was good, you know,

10:45.198 --> 10:47.199
but... but you're cold-blooded.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.901
- (CHUCKLING)
- Ooh, I got one.

10:48.902 --> 10:52.871
Your daddy's head smells
like doodie fish. Ha!

10:52.872 --> 10:54.473
(CHUCKLING): What's a...
what's a "doodie fish," though?

10:54.474 --> 10:56.308
- (TERRY AND REL LAUGH)
- REL: I like how you added

10:56.309 --> 10:58.744
the "ha" at the end, 'cause
it made more emphasis to it.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.212
- (CHUCKLING)
- Wow, I haven't heard

11:00.213 --> 11:01.680
that much laughter in here in a while.

11:01.681 --> 11:03.982
And I made you a plate.

11:03.983 --> 11:06.418
Mom, I'm sorry I got suspended.

11:06.419 --> 11:08.420
I know what I did was wrong.

11:08.421 --> 11:09.788
Dad helped me see that.

11:09.789 --> 11:10.889
SHANNON: Wow.

11:10.890 --> 11:12.891
Okay, apology accepted.

11:12.892 --> 11:15.461
Come here and give me a hug. Mm!

11:15.462 --> 11:17.863
Come on, Terry,
let's get our pajamas on

11:17.864 --> 11:20.065
so we can watch a family movie.

11:20.066 --> 11:22.267
Oh! Oh! Hi, Mom.

11:22.268 --> 11:23.602
Hi.

11:25.171 --> 11:27.606
Okay, wait. Laughter, dinner,

11:27.607 --> 11:30.275
family movie night and an
apology from my daughter?

11:30.276 --> 11:32.911
- Look at you. Well done.
- Yeah, you know,

11:32.912 --> 11:34.613
I taught her some
coping skills, you know.

11:34.614 --> 11:36.248
And, uh, guess what?

11:36.249 --> 11:37.583
I made the cocoa.

Damn, Rel.

11:42.555 --> 11:44.556
They seem really happy.

11:44.557 --> 11:46.859
I have to admit,
I was a little nervous

11:46.860 --> 11:49.394
about asking you to come here,
but this is nice.

11:49.396 --> 11:51.396
In fact... mmm, smells good...

11:51.398 --> 11:53.398
I am gonna go take off this suit,

11:53.400 --> 11:55.834
so that <i>I'll</i> be ready
for family movie night.

11:55.835 --> 11:57.870
Go and get comfortable. (CHUCKLES)

11:57.871 --> 12:00.906
- Don't drink my cocoa.
- (LAUGHS): I won't.

12:00.907 --> 12:02.975
Okay. You're killing it, Rel.

12:02.976 --> 12:05.277
You are the man. (CHUCKLES)

12:05.278 --> 12:07.913
Aah, hot, hot, hot!

12:07.914 --> 12:09.848
All right, when you're making
a vision board,

12:09.849 --> 12:11.783
you shouldn't think
of objects you want.

12:11.785 --> 12:14.453
Think of objects that represent
where you want your life to go.

12:14.454 --> 12:17.689
Do either of you envision
a drink in your future?

12:17.690 --> 12:22.394
Because if not, I can see my
future without you in the bar.

12:22.395 --> 12:24.396
Look, yo, yo, this place is good luck.

12:24.397 --> 12:26.431
This is exactly where Rel was
when his kids called

12:26.433 --> 12:28.200
and his vision board came true.

12:28.201 --> 12:29.902
- What's that, Nat? What'd you say?
- I was...

12:29.903 --> 12:34.473
Oh, you want a vodka soda
and a beer? Coming right up.

12:34.474 --> 12:37.175
Let's see what you got on yours, Nat.

12:38.545 --> 12:40.679
It's hard to make sense of this.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.981
Is that a briefcase
and a woman twerking?

12:42.982 --> 12:45.117
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,
I want a job, right?

12:45.118 --> 12:47.119
But I want a "good-ass" job.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.121
You see what I'm saying?

12:49.122 --> 12:50.956
Feel me?

12:50.957 --> 12:53.025
Right there.

12:53.026 --> 12:56.061
Look, you know
this ain't a word game, right?

12:56.062 --> 12:58.897
Then why... why ain't
no pictures right there?

12:58.898 --> 13:01.733
Oh, see, that represents
endless possibilities.

13:01.734 --> 13:04.036
But it's... it's nothing.

13:04.037 --> 13:06.271
Yeah, but it <i>could</i> be anything,
you see what I'm saying?

13:06.272 --> 13:07.539
You gotta open your mind, Britt.

13:07.540 --> 13:08.740
Yo, Brittany,

13:08.741 --> 13:10.609
how's Rel doing in Cleveland?

13:10.610 --> 13:14.112
Did he get back with his ex
and re-tear that ass up?

13:17.984 --> 13:21.019
No. But last night, I did find
out he was staying at the house.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.788
Oh. Don't worry. Look, I got a picture

13:22.789 --> 13:25.157
of Rel's favorite deep dish
spot on this vision board.

13:25.158 --> 13:27.459
That'll make sure the universe
don't let him move to Cleveland.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.032
Might be too late for that.
I've been calling his ass

13:29.033 --> 13:31.763
all night, and he ain't answered.

um, I'm-a stay an extra night.

14:00.126 --> 14:02.227
- What?
- I'm just saying, me being here

14:02.228 --> 14:04.429
has been beneficial
for the kids, okay?

<i>- Beneficial for the kids?</i>

Erica, would you mind
telling your parents

14:46.635 --> 14:47.946
what happened, please?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.048
Well, I was doing my math lab,

14:50.072 --> 14:52.506
and Lisa Maxwell said
that I was a baby,

14:52.507 --> 14:54.642
because I was counting
on my fingers, and I said,

14:54.643 --> 14:56.677
"You need to put some lotion
on your elbows,

14:56.678 --> 14:59.113
because they look like they've
been dipped in cake batter."

14:59.114 --> 15:00.548
Dip, dip, dip.

15:03.251 --> 15:05.219
Are these the coping skills
you taught her?

15:05.220 --> 15:08.155
Yes, but honest, I didn't know
she was gonna be so good at it.

15:08.156 --> 15:10.458
And look, to tell you the truth,
the other girl started it,

15:10.459 --> 15:12.359
You know what I mean?
When did you start

15:12.361 --> 15:14.128
- suspending kids for being hilarious?
- Okay,

15:14.129 --> 15:15.729
that's-that's not what we're doing.

15:15.731 --> 15:17.131
I am sorry for what she did,

15:17.132 --> 15:19.166
and I am very sorry
for what my husband did.

15:19.167 --> 15:20.734
I'm sorry. My... my ex-husband.

15:20.736 --> 15:22.736
Actually, he's not my ex-husband yet.

15:22.738 --> 15:25.606
We're just separated, so I
am sorry for what this guy did,

15:25.607 --> 15:27.374
but I have to agree with him:

15:27.376 --> 15:29.043
she should not be suspended.

15:29.044 --> 15:31.445
Yeah, yeah, man. I mean,
that girl insulted her first.

15:31.446 --> 15:32.780
First.

15:32.781 --> 15:34.515
Well, she's not
getting suspended for that.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.717
In fact, I want
to apologize to you both

15:36.718 --> 15:38.486

that Erica was being bullied.

can you come in here, please?

Uh, can you tell them what happened?

15:46.762 --> 15:48.262

15:48.263 --> 15:50.931
This little itty-bitty,
tiny little girl

15:50.932 --> 15:53.801
had the audacity to insult me
that was so tragic.

15:53.802 --> 15:55.803
I mean, the words were insulting,

15:55.804 --> 15:58.339

of what she said to me.

is ridiculous!

She's a little monster,
that's what she is, okay?

16:04.212 --> 16:06.680
And what she said to me
had all the kids all riled up.

16:06.681 --> 16:08.682
It was almost a riot in my classroom!

16:08.683 --> 16:10.184
I couldn't hear myself think!

16:10.185 --> 16:12.486
Okay, Mr. Humphries, what did she do?

16:12.487 --> 16:15.689
Now, I told myself
I wouldn't repeat this.

16:15.690 --> 16:17.691
But if I got to, I will!

16:17.692 --> 16:20.094

"Say it, don't spray it"!

Okay.

I am sure that Erica is
very sorry for what she did.

to her teacher like that.

All right, Rel, um,
how about you tell me

16:51.893 --> 16:54.128
what you were thinking
when you taught our daughter

16:54.129 --> 16:55.963
to be disrespectful and insult people?

16:55.964 --> 16:57.932
Well, first of all, I was teaching her

16:57.933 --> 17:00.134
to stand up for herself,
instead of what you taught her

17:00.135 --> 17:02.670
- as doing nothing at all.
- I didn't teach her to do <i>nothing.</i>

17:02.671 --> 17:04.238
I told her to be the bigger person.

17:04.239 --> 17:06.240
Well, to me, the bigger person
is the better roaster, okay?

17:06.241 --> 17:07.840
You're from Chicago.
You know how we get down.

17:07.843 --> 17:10.010
Ugh! Rel, here we go. This is not

17:10.011 --> 17:13.446
- a Chicago-Cleveland thing!
- Well, maybe it is, okay?

17:13.448 --> 17:15.382
You know why it's
a Chicago-Cleveland thing?

17:15.383 --> 17:18.719
Because I live in Chicago
and my kids live in Cleveland.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.654
Did you ever think
that maybe she's acting out

17:20.655 --> 17:22.690
because I'm not around?

17:22.691 --> 17:24.724
I knew you would make this about you.

17:24.726 --> 17:26.560
See, there you go
with that again, like,

17:26.560 --> 17:29.263

selfish, you know what I mean?

17:36.304 --> 17:39.573
You know something,
what-what are we doing?

17:39.574 --> 17:41.508
I know.

17:41.510 --> 17:43.444
Dang.

17:43.445 --> 17:46.113
And these last couple of days,
they've been really nice.

17:46.114 --> 17:48.382
I actually thought
maybe there was a chance,

17:48.383 --> 17:50.651
just maybe, that we could work out.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.519
Here's the thing about it.

17:52.521 --> 17:56.190
We can't make it about us
no more, all right?

17:56.191 --> 17:59.059
It gotta just be about them.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.395
Look, I'm sorry.

18:01.396 --> 18:03.631
I'm sorry, too.

18:03.632 --> 18:06.734
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

18:07.802 --> 18:09.269
(REL SIGHS)

18:10.472 --> 18:12.439
Look, I know we're not...

18:12.440 --> 18:15.142
we're not good
at being husband and wife.

18:15.143 --> 18:19.046
Matter of fact,
we might be kind of terrible.

18:19.047 --> 18:21.882
We got to make sure we're
great co-parents for them.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.550
You're right.

18:23.552 --> 18:26.320
And I have to be completely honest.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.892
The kids are having
a hard time adjusting.

18:32.634 --> 18:35.206
I knew it would be hard
moving them from you

18:35.230 --> 18:37.564
but this job offer,
it was just so good,

18:37.566 --> 18:41.101
and at the time, I just thought
it was what was best for them.

18:41.102 --> 18:42.770
Look, look, hey, hey, don't-don't...

18:42.771 --> 18:44.505
you can't beat yourself up
about this, okay?

18:44.506 --> 18:46.573
Agreed with you about
bringing them here to Cleveland.

18:46.575 --> 18:48.676
You know, because this is
a huge opportunity for you,

18:48.677 --> 18:50.711
and you deserve that...
you've worked really hard

18:50.712 --> 18:53.714
to get where you at.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.216
Look, Shannon... (SIGHS)

18:56.217 --> 18:58.419
Look, what can I...

18:58.420 --> 19:01.855
No, let me rephrase that.

19:01.856 --> 19:04.825
What can we do to make
this situation better?

19:07.395 --> 19:10.264
Look, look, I know you guys have
been worried about me, but...

19:10.265 --> 19:12.066
but Cleveland was, um...

19:12.067 --> 19:13.567
Cleveland was amazing.

19:13.568 --> 19:16.170
So, look, I got a surprise for you.

19:16.171 --> 19:17.938
I brought back a couple of souvenirs.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.973
- ERICA AND TERRY: Hey!
- What?

19:19.975 --> 19:21.508
RY - What, what, what?

19:21.509 --> 19:23.177
- Aw...
- (LAUGHING)

19:23.178 --> 19:24.978
Oh, hey, hey, don't get me wrong, man,

19:24.980 --> 19:26.513
I love seeing my grandkids, but...

19:26.514 --> 19:28.682
(QUIETLY): ...did you kidnap them?

19:28.683 --> 19:30.551
Dad, no, no.

19:30.552 --> 19:32.653
- So, how long are they visiting for?
- No, no,

19:32.654 --> 19:34.254
it's not a visit, all right?

19:34.255 --> 19:36.323
Look, me and Shannon
worked out all our issues,

19:36.324 --> 19:38.459
and we had a long talk, and
we felt that, like, you know,

19:38.460 --> 19:40.294
bringing them back to Chicago
to finish the school year,

19:40.295 --> 19:42.262
it's just better for them...
you know, put them back in,

19:42.263 --> 19:44.075
- like, familiar settings, you
know what I mean? - Yeah.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.632
And, look, Shannon,
this gives her time to,

19:45.634 --> 19:47.768
like, get settled into her job, and...

19:47.769 --> 19:50.471
- Look, she's an amazing mom,
honestly, and... right now -Yeah.

19:50.472 --> 19:53.107
We're just trying to be
the best co-parents we can be.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.209
Look, look... l right, all right,

19:55.210 --> 19:57.478
We got the family all back together.

19:57.479 --> 20:00.314
- How we gonna celebrate?
- Breakfast for dinner.

20:00.315 --> 20:03.183
(CHUCKLES) That's right, I'm
making my famous scrambled eggs.

20:03.184 --> 20:06.053
Eggs? Man, these kids been in
Cleveland for six months, man.

20:06.054 --> 20:07.654
Who wants deep dish?

20:07.656 --> 20:09.656
(WHOOPING, CHEERING)

20:11.393 --> 20:13.761
For real? I mean, you don't ask
my permission or nothing?

20:13.762 --> 20:15.562
You're just gonna
walk out with my kids?

20:15.563 --> 20:17.231
BRITTANY: Bye. (CHUCKLES)

20:21.925 --> 20:23.874
Larry, you're not gonna believe

20:23.875 --> 20:26.710
what this little nasty
little bitty boy did today.

20:26.711 --> 20:29.679
He did one of the most
disgusting crimes of all time.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.115
This little boy is one
of the nastiest little people

20:32.116 --> 20:33.817
I've ever met in my life,

20:33.818 --> 20:35.685
and I am sick of it!

20:35.686 --> 20:38.355
When I tell you what he did,
you're gonna be... Oh, my God,

20:38.356 --> 20:40.724
it's such a bacterial crime,
you're gonna be so... Oh!

20:40.725 --> 20:42.726
Here we go. I'll tell you
what he did... this little boy

20:42.727 --> 20:44.895
went to the bathroom
and didn't wash his hands.

20:44.896 --> 20:47.697
And when I asked him,
he admitted to it!

20:47.698 --> 20:49.733
He is disgusting. Now,
this is what I suggest we do.

20:49.734 --> 20:51.167
We don't have to suspend him,

20:51.169 --> 20:53.403
but we should hand-sanitize
his whole body.

20:53.404 --> 20:56.273
That's right. I want permission
to strip him and dip him.

20:56.274 --> 20:58.208
Absolutely not!

20:58.209 --> 21:00.577
Young man, go wash your hands
and go back to class, please.

21:00.578 --> 21:03.513
Thank you, sir. You're a young
king out here on these streets.

21:03.514 --> 21:05.682
He's not a king, he's disgusting!

21:05.683 --> 21:07.617
Mr. Humphries...

21:07.618 --> 21:10.266
you can't keep trying
to suspend every kid,

21:10.267 --> 21:11.808
or the board is gonna find out

21:11.809 --> 21:14.544
that you, in fact, hate children!

21:14.545 --> 21:17.246
Let me say this to you:
you are a coward.

21:17.247 --> 21:20.249
You are a <i>coward!</i>

21:20.250 --> 21:21.651
And guess what?

21:21.652 --> 21:23.619
I quit. I don't need this mess.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.154
I am done, Larry!

21:25.155 --> 21:26.956
That's right, Mr. Humphries is done!

21:26.957 --> 21:29.358
I'm going back into
show business. That's right!

21:29.359 --> 21:31.027
I'm gonna call
Patti LaBelle right now.

21:31.028 --> 21:34.463
Patti! Patti! Patti?!
