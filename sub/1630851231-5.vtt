05:54.092 --> 05:56.094
to tell her I was staying over.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.401

unusual around recently?

any threats?

06:09.847 --> 06:11.893
Or did she have any issues with

No, nothing like that, no.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.462

06:15.505 --> 06:17.333

might want to hurt Charlotte?

everybody likes Charlotte.

06:22.294 --> 06:25.297

that nobody--nobody--

06:25.341 --> 06:26.995

it's possible

06:27.038 --> 06:29.563
that Charlotte's abduction
was financially motivated.

to make that happen.

our assistance,

07:12.040 --> 07:13.868

we need to know about it.

off the pipe,

07:23.138 --> 07:24.792
that the blood on the pipe
was Charlotte's.

Charlotte is injured.

from yesterday

07:36.325 --> 07:38.022

no record of him staying there.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.286

from his firm.

of any investment property.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.681

07:44.725 --> 07:46.248
- So what was he doing
in Newport?

07:46.291 --> 07:47.989
- Well, according to his
transaction history,

07:48.032 --> 07:50.861
running up a $10,000 debt
at the Tiverton Casino,

07:50.905 --> 07:53.298
which seems to be a theme
with him, losing money.

07:53.342 --> 07:55.692
Pulled his financials--
he lost a lot of money

07:55.736 --> 07:57.346

the past few years.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.696
- Did he gamble all night?
- No, cashed out at 6:00,

07:59.740 --> 08:01.350
called his wife,
then shut his phone off.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.091
Didn't turn it back on
till this morning.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.745
- Okay,
so we can't actually confirm

08:04.788 --> 08:06.181
where he was most of the night.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.966
- Newport's only three hours
from Greenwich.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.577
Leaves him plenty of time
to get back.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.708
- Sure.
Do we have any reason

08:11.752 --> 08:13.014
to believe
he would hurt his wife?

08:13.057 --> 08:15.016
- Nothing jumps out.
- Right, okay.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.801
So--so we have a missing wife,
a lying husband

08:17.845 --> 08:20.674
with a gambling jones
and bad business acumen.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.632

08:22.676 --> 08:24.068
Looks like most of
the Kincades' money

08:24.112 --> 08:26.549

Charlotte's inheritance.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.856

a pretty serious prenup too.

- Checking now.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.303

is the sole beneficiary.

Bring him in.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.873

The tracker Maggie put
on Alex's car just went live.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.790
He's leaving the house.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.575
- All right, eyes up.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.404
Follow him
and see what he's up to.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.978
- We got eyes
on the suspect.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.024
- Copy. We see him.

09:08.199 --> 09:10.027
Not a lot going on around here.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.073
Good place for a ransom drop.

09:12.116 --> 09:14.205

21:53.137 --> 21:55.009
a sex club? No.

21:57.011 --> 22:00.231
No, I had no idea.

22:00.275 --> 22:01.581
- Okay, we understand
that this is difficult,

22:01.624 --> 22:03.539
but we need you to think.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.673
Have you noticed your wife
with anybody suspicious?

22:06.716 --> 22:10.241
- No, nothing like that.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.114
But I don't know, I--

22:13.157 --> 22:15.029
I haven't been around
that much lately.

22:15.072 --> 22:18.032
- Okay, what about
the last few months then?

22:18.075 --> 22:19.860
Did you ever see her scared
or rattled?

22:19.903 --> 22:23.385
Maybe a phone conversation,
a text message, an altercation?

22:25.039 --> 22:26.693
Come on, Alex.
Think.

22:26.736 --> 22:28.738
- Look, I am thinking, I--

22:33.264 --> 22:37.704
Last week,
she went to Beulah's.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.358
We had our first date there.

22:39.401 --> 22:43.144
Every year, we go there on
the anniversary to celebrate.

22:43.187 --> 22:47.801
But this year, I had to work,
and she went alone.

22:53.110 --> 22:55.722
- We contacted that restaurant
that Alex mentioned, Beulah's.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.376
Spoke to the maître d'.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.421
Turns out Charlotte
did have a bad run-in there.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.335
There was a guy
that went to sit with her

23:00.379 --> 23:01.641
and wouldn't leave her alone.

23:01.684 --> 23:02.816
The staff ended up having
to remove the guy.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.818
- Oh, we got footage of this?

23:04.861 --> 23:06.733
- No cameras in the restaurant,
but the maître d' said that

23:06.776 --> 23:10.084
the guy specifically requested
the table next to Charlotte.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.955
- Okay, so this definitely
could be our guy.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.783
We have a name?
- Not exactly.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.437
Name on the reservation
seemed like a fake.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.439
But the restaurant copied down
the phone number

23:17.483 --> 23:19.093
from caller ID
when he booked it.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.269
- All right. Run this.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.053
Let's see who owns this number.

to a landline in Purchase.

or a tenant?

23:37.328 --> 23:39.940

gave a fake name?

23:43.247 --> 23:45.859
- Wallingford.
Okay, that's strange.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.251
Typically you use something

23:47.295 --> 23:49.645

for a fake name.

23:49.689 --> 23:53.606
Wallingford must have
some other significance, right?

23:56.086 --> 23:57.740

from Wallingford, Connecticut.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.525
- Okay, there it is.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.483
So Charlotte Kincade's unwanted
suitor knew where she was born

24:01.527 --> 24:04.051
and knew the time and place
of her anniversary dinner.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.810
We cannot save her,

27:17.853 --> 27:19.725

to save Charlotte.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.901
- And we're gonna start
by trying to figure out

27:21.944 --> 27:23.685
how he met Brenda,

27:23.729 --> 27:25.905
how long did he hold
her hostage before killing her.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.776
- Okay, I just got off
the phone with the sex club.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.169
They confirmed Brenda
was a member.

27:29.212 --> 27:30.692
So our abductor
most likely used that

27:30.736 --> 27:32.215
as his hunting ground.

27:32.259 --> 27:36.132
- Which means our abductor
has done this before.

27:36.176 --> 27:38.178
He's prowled the night club,

27:38.221 --> 27:40.006
zeroed in
on an attractive woman,

27:40.049 --> 27:42.486
stalked her, held her hostage.

Charlotte was held in

that she's in love with him,

27:54.063 --> 27:55.325
and once he realizes
that doesn't work--

27:55.369 --> 27:56.762
- She'll wind up
just like Brenda,

27:56.805 --> 27:58.198
and he'll move on
to another woman

27:58.241 --> 28:00.113

all over again.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.213

When did she get back?

28:13.256 --> 28:15.171
- I just checked
flight records,

28:15.215 --> 28:17.913
and she never left the country,
never even bought a ticket.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.654
- And she hasn't used her phone
or credit card

28:19.698 --> 28:21.308

I think it's a fake.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.962

So let's dig in.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.102
And when we caught up with him,
he was running errands.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.931
It's unlikely he would leave
Charlotte alone for very long.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.107
So we should assume
he's holding her somewhere

32:59.151 --> 33:01.240
near the country store.
The question is where?

33:01.283 --> 33:03.068
Where are we
on the stolen pickup truck?

33:03.111 --> 33:05.940
- We put out a BOLO,
but it's a 2006 Ford F-150.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.855
There's no GPS tech
on models that old.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.422
- What about the cab?

33:09.465 --> 33:11.032
We track it back to wherever
he dropped her off?

33:11.076 --> 33:12.251
- No, he'd already
dropped Charlotte

33:12.294 --> 33:14.122
by the time we tapped
into the live GPS.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.256
It only goes back as far
as a gas station in the area.

33:17.299 --> 33:20.259
- He's been careful
every step of the way.

33:20.302 --> 33:21.956
He'd want to bring her
somewhere he knew

33:22.000 --> 33:25.046
would not be disturbed.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.656
It's off-season
in the Catskills.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.703
Can you put together a list
of vacant summer properties?

33:29.746 --> 33:31.052
- Looking at a few thousand.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.315
It'll take days
to hit them all.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.100
- Okay, well, scratch that.

33:35.143 --> 33:38.755
- Does Frasier have
any connection to this place?

33:38.799 --> 33:41.932
- He was picked up for vagrancy
in New Paltz in 2016.

33:41.976 --> 33:44.892
- Right. Well, okay.

33:44.935 --> 33:47.242
Unlikely he would have any
fuzzy feelings for the place.

33:47.286 --> 33:48.722
What about Charlotte?
Any connection?

33:48.765 --> 33:49.984
- Got something.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.899
Charlotte posted this
five months ago.

33:51.942 --> 33:54.075
Check out the caption.

when the picture was taken.

34:02.692 --> 34:05.304
- Okay, but BAU said that they
think that Frasier's trying

34:05.347 --> 34:06.653
to get Charlotte to fall
in love with him, right?

34:06.696 --> 34:08.394
- Yeah.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.700
- He designed that room at
Brenda's specifically for her.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.615
He's not gonna move her
from that unless he's taken her

34:12.659 --> 34:14.922
to a place
that makes her even happier.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.358
- Right.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.143
So maybe
he's holding her someplace

34:18.186 --> 34:19.709
that's special to her.

34:19.753 --> 34:20.971
All right. Talk to Alex.

I had a job offer
from a big Wall Street firm.

But I wasn't into it. I wanted
to work at this crazy startup.
