00:06.340 --> 00:06.507
.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.208
- Previously on "Shooter"...

00:09.277 --> 00:10.678
- The thing we have to figure
out is who hired Solotov.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.313
- How do we know
it wasn't Gregson?

00:12.346 --> 00:13.781
- No, someone else
is pulling the strings.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.549
- How'd you find me?
- Start talking.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.485
Who asked you to sign your name
to Zehnder's psych evals?

00:17.518 --> 00:20.588
- The FBI, CIA,
all the cartels.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.689
It's Atlas.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.257
There's a banker in Mexico.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.126
He's running all the books

00:25.159 --> 00:27.461
for the cartels
and for Atlas.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.796
- What the hell?

00:28.829 --> 00:30.664
- Now Solotov
can't get his money.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.733
- The more people you kill,
the less safe my family is.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.602
- You're jumpy
and you snap at Mary.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.470
- You're saying I have PTSD.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.705
- Run along, sweetheart.

00:37.738 --> 00:38.839
Ow!

00:38.872 --> 00:40.508
I know who your husband is.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.476
- Well, then you know he can
smoke your low-rent ass

00:42.510 --> 00:44.778
from 800 yards away
with a beer in one hand.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.347
- Bo's filing charges
against you.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.815
Might want to call a lawyer.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.650
- Do I understand
that Bob Lee Swagger

00:49.683 --> 00:51.619
has been drawn into this?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.287
- Yes, unfortunate.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.089
- I'm Travis.
- I'm Julie.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.690
Mary has her First
Communion this weekend.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.192
You're more than
welcome to come.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.693
- Who the hell
is this guy?

00:59.727 --> 01:02.163
- He's Chechen.
Fought with the separatists.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.265
The Russians called him
Prizra, The Ghost.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.499
They gassed a whole village.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.401
Killed hundreds,
mostly civilians.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.603
- He's killing anybody
who's seen his face.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.172
[gunshot]

01:11.205 --> 01:12.773
- I'm not tying up
loose ends, Swagger.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.209
I am burning the rope.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.415
[explosion booming]

01:26.220 --> 01:29.190
[tense music]

01:38.799 --> 01:41.235
[indistinct chatter]

01:41.269 --> 01:44.338
*

01:44.372 --> 01:47.175
[all murmuring
in native language]

01:47.208 --> 01:54.415
*

01:57.851 --> 01:59.320
- [screams]

02:06.460 --> 02:08.596

[gunshot]

02:43.797 --> 02:51.171
*

03:23.771 --> 03:25.373
- Where is he?

03:25.406 --> 03:26.974
- He's at the bottom
of the east stairwell.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.609
I'm headed down.
- Roger that.

03:28.642 --> 03:35.683
*

03:37.851 --> 03:40.721
- So this is Solotov?

03:40.754 --> 03:43.257
- You shouldn't be here.
I could have done this myself.

03:43.291 --> 03:47.361
- He's too important; there was
no time to send anyone else.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.266
Okay.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.769
Right there.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.739
*

03:58.772 --> 04:01.809
- [groaning]
- Okay, okay, easy.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.312
Easy now.
Come on. Come on.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.979
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.748
Okay.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.418
That's right.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.920
Welcome back.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.456
Welcome home.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.692
[dramatic music]

04:35.709 --> 04:35.876
.

04:35.909 --> 04:36.977
- Look, Sheriff Brown is
blowing this out of proportion.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.614
Bo's not gonna
press charges, okay?

04:40.648 --> 04:43.484
- If he does,
you're facing felony assault.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.918
That's two years minimum.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.754
- The guy was being
an asshole, Bob Lee.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.322
- I'm sure he was, Julie,

04:48.356 --> 04:50.458
and I'm sure you know
that's not the point.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.593
You blew the guy's ear out.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.094
And then you threatened
to have me kill him.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.029
- Shit.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.931
- Why did you do this with
everything we're up against?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.767
- It's not like
I planned it, okay?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.469
The guy pissed me off,
and the gun went off.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.472
- Guns don't just go off, Jules.

05:04.505 --> 05:08.376
- Look, I told you,
I haven't been doing well.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.779
- 'Cause of Frankfurt?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.882
- Since before Frankfurt.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.718
I just didn't want
to say anything.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.888
Okay--I feel small compared
to the things that you've seen

05:20.921 --> 05:22.956
and you've done,
but I'm scared, okay?

05:22.990 --> 05:26.760
I'm not--
I'm not me.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.930
- You are you, Jules.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.934
You've just been
through the blender a little.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.970
And more importantly,
we're us.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.508
- Yeah.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.044
Look, we have to stop pretending
like this shit is normal.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.679
There's an assassin out there.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.047
- I'm gonna take care of him.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.718
But I can't do that
and cover my six.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.387
I need you guys
to take a trip.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.755
- I can't, I can't.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.690
Sheriff Brown said
I can't leave the county.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.126
- Well, we have to
prioritize our problems.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.661
Solotov first.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.895
- Look, Mary's First
Communion is tomorrow.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.931
We can't do that
to her, all right?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.533
She's been working
so hard at this.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.934
She needs to see
something through.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.069
- And after that?

06:09.102 --> 06:11.138
- We'll make a plan.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.017
[bell dings]

06:24.051 --> 06:26.086
- Hey.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.422
Everything you need to worry
about is sitting right here.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.691
Look, I don't want you.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.427
I want Atlas.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.862
You're a good Marine, Tio.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.431
- Am I?
- Yeah, you are.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.800
And Marines don't do this
to other Marines.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.169
Somebody ordered you to cook up
those mental health records

06:42.202 --> 06:43.771
and destroy Zehnder.
I need a name.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.839
- That name's all I got.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.107
It's the only reason
I'm alive.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.943
- We can protect you.
- We. We?

06:49.977 --> 06:53.080
The government?
How do you think this started?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.849
- Hey, you gotta give us
a little something.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.852
All right,
point us in a direction.

06:58.886 --> 07:02.022
- Zehnder's story was true.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.758
- Which part?
- All of it.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.860
CIA selling heroin.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.062
The fact that Atlas
sent some guy

07:09.096 --> 07:11.131
posed as a UN doctor
to kill that woman.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.100
- Why would Atlas care
about a drug lord's wife?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.235
- Because she knew too much
and she was willing to talk,

07:15.268 --> 07:17.605
like Zehnder.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.774
- So how are you
still alive?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.245
- Because I took their money.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.081
- Yeah, now they own you.
Well, I hope it was worth it.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.884
- It's better than
being dead, okay?

07:30.918 --> 07:32.753
I had no choice.
I still don't.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.254
And Zehnder
should have known better.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.056
He didn't have to start
feeding you information.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.158
- Yeah, but when he did,
Atlas told you to end it.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.028
- Yeah, well, they didn't say
they were gonna kill him.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.564
They just wanted--
they wanted me

07:43.597 --> 07:45.899
to help convince the newspaper
that he was nuts.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.169
Because if he was nuts--
- I wouldn't have a story.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.646
- [sighs]

07:58.679 --> 08:00.848

[line ringing]

08:05.285 --> 08:07.521
[phone vibrates]

08:09.957 --> 08:13.193
- Bob Lee Swagger.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.195
I hope it's you.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.297
Since you're calling
from his ranch.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.668
- You know a lot more about me
than I know about you.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.970
- Well, I know that you
and Isaac Johnson

08:23.003 --> 08:25.873
made quite a spectacle
of yourselves in Mexico.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.176
- So you also know
I got your money.

08:29.209 --> 08:34.682
- And you would like to
purchase what with it exactly?

08:34.715 --> 08:37.117
- Solotov.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.656
- Keep your phone on,

08:42.690 --> 08:44.758
and Solotov will call you.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.159
Then he's your problem.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.328
- And how do you know
he'll contact me?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.799
- Because it wasn't just
my money you stole.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.001
It was his.
[click]

09:03.777 --> 09:05.245
- Turn that off.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.815
- Jesus.

09:07.848 --> 09:11.585
I didn't know
you were here.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.753
What are you doing?

09:12.786 --> 09:14.287
- Heading out.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.023
Mary asleep?

09:16.056 --> 09:19.092
- Yeah, she wanted
a kiss good night, but--

09:19.126 --> 09:21.128
- I'll pop in later.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.863
- Later?
Where are you going?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.065
- Overwatch.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.002
Hey.
- Yeah?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.203
- When were you gonna tell me

09:30.237 --> 09:32.072
that you've been
having problems?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.607
- I don't know.
You never really seem

09:33.641 --> 09:34.975
to have time to hear
about what's going on.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.744
- Don't give me that.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.046
- You've been lying to me since
we got back from Frankfurt.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.614
You told me that
all of this was over.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.249
Do you remember that?
- I'm trying to--

09:42.282 --> 09:45.619
- To protect me, right?
I know.

09:45.653 --> 09:49.089
What you don't realize is I do
the same damn thing for you.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.926
You know that Mary's
hiding in the bathtub

09:52.960 --> 09:56.096
with her dolls again?

09:56.129 --> 09:58.031
- I didn't know that.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.133
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.303
[tense music]

10:03.336 --> 10:10.077

10:22.790 --> 10:24.091

*

11:02.863 --> 11:04.064
- On your knees.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.332
I said on your knees.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.135
- I'm American.
I'm armed.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.338
- Well, look here.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.440
Doesn't look like
the banditos we usually catch,

11:13.473 --> 11:14.708
now does it, boys?

11:14.742 --> 11:16.309
- It's so dark out here.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.879
We almost didn't see you, boy.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.814
What do you got, huh?

11:20.848 --> 11:23.917
What do you got--
what do you got back here, huh?

11:23.951 --> 11:27.054
[groaning]

11:27.087 --> 11:28.989
Shoot him!
Kill that son of a bitch!

11:29.022 --> 11:32.259
[siren blares]

11:32.292 --> 11:35.128
- U.S. Border Patrol.
Drop your weapons.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.031
Drop your weapons,
or we'll open fire.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.903
- [groaning]

11:42.936 --> 11:45.806
- Damn, Darryl.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.308
How many times we gotta
clean up your mess, huh?

11:48.341 --> 11:51.011
- This asshole
stabbed my man.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.345
- What is it
with you militia guys?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.148
Get him up and get him
to the hospital.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.018
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.121
You're also under arrest.

12:06.326 --> 12:10.163
- Oh, well, how did
you like the play?

12:10.197 --> 12:12.165
- In my opinion,
only Brits should be allowed

12:12.199 --> 12:13.466
to do Shakespeare.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.769
Lacks a certain
authenticity over here.

12:15.803 --> 12:19.072
- And yet you came
to see the show anyway.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.010
- Do I have anything
to be worried about?

12:23.043 --> 12:24.511
I hear there was trouble
at the border.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.279
- I'm insulted.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.281
After all these years,
you really don't think I know

12:28.315 --> 12:31.218
how to handle my people?

12:31.251 --> 12:34.788
- Well, I'm glad I can
still count on you, Patricia.

12:34.822 --> 12:38.358
- I'm sorry I can't say
the same about you.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.395
[engine turns over]

12:42.429 --> 12:44.832

rest of the evening.

13:17.064 --> 13:20.000
SOLOTOV: Modern life
is so busy.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.468
- This has to end.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.304
It's not me you want.
It's Atlas.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.239
Nobody else has to die.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.242
[tense music]

13:29.276 --> 13:31.044
*

13:31.078 --> 13:32.445
- I see.

13:32.479 --> 13:36.116
So did he even hesitate?

13:36.149 --> 13:39.252
- Who?
- My former boss. Master.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.989
Whatever we're
calling him these days.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.157
- No, he didn't.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.093
I took his money.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.128
He gave you up before
I could finish the sentence.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.597
So how about you give me
his name?

13:50.630 --> 13:54.067
- But this man, Swagger,
you do not know him like I do.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.403
His word, it means nothing.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.872
He plays with people's lives.

13:58.906 --> 14:02.910
Swagger, if you have my money,
what are we waiting for?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.112
- I'm waiting to hear
what I get in return.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.114
- You get to live.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.548
Again.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.084
- What the hell
are you talking about?

14:11.118 --> 14:13.954
- Do you think when I killed
your spotter in Afghanistan

14:13.987 --> 14:15.923
I did not have you, too?

14:15.956 --> 14:17.490
And you did not
see my face.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.194
And after studying you
for so many weeks,

14:21.228 --> 14:23.296
I felt a connection.

14:23.330 --> 14:26.633
I thought,
here is a true warrior.

14:26.666 --> 14:30.403
Maybe he wishes
for another life, like I do.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.672
I let you live
with an injury

14:32.705 --> 14:35.242
that ended your days
on the battlefield.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.077
- Bullshit.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.280
You made a mistake and now
you're trying to clean it up.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.283
- Beautiful family.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.385
Beautiful home.

14:45.418 --> 14:49.056
And you cannot stop
chasing a ghost.

14:49.089 --> 14:52.359
Most men would be in bed
next to their wife.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.294
- You don't get
to talk about her.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.096
- Yes.

14:56.129 --> 14:59.299
Best to pretend she is not
involved, is it not?

14:59.332 --> 15:02.669
She is in bed sound asleep,
I hope.

15:02.702 --> 15:07.340
And you're in a high position
75 yards east of your barn.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.343
- Yeah, I had you down
to three positions.

15:10.377 --> 15:14.081
Factoring in
that I broke your wrist,

15:14.114 --> 15:16.216
I figure you're hunkered down
next to those water towers

15:16.249 --> 15:18.285
in a place you could
steady yourself.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.720
610 yards to the front door.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.956
Relative elevation isn't much.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.657
Maybe 15 feet.

15:24.691 --> 15:28.428
- Swagger, you understand
that this is the way

15:28.461 --> 15:30.297
I want it to end.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.666
- Not as long as I have the
money that buys your freedom.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.569
- I can take everything
from you.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.040
Do not forget it.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.442
- Go to hell.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.647
[buzzer hums]

15:50.550 --> 15:52.719
- Morning, sunshine.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.487
[door buzzes]

15:56.023 --> 15:57.724
We used your lifeline,
like you asked.

15:57.757 --> 16:02.495
Patricia Gregson,
never heard of you.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.764
You're being extradited
to Mexico.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.366
- For what?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.068
- Well, you killed a man,
for starters.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.602
- Says who?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.438
- No one had
to say anything.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.607
It was all on video.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.177
[buzz]

16:20.813 --> 16:23.550
- All right, thanks.
Bye.

16:23.583 --> 16:27.587
Okay, Cleveland office
is waiting for us.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.622
45-minute drive,
and we're safe.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.424
- Who knows you're here?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.360
- Come on, Tio,
it's not my first rodeo.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.761
- And him?

16:34.794 --> 16:37.064
- My editor knows
I'm working on a story,

16:37.097 --> 16:40.333
but I didn't tell him
my location, so...

16:40.367 --> 16:42.235
Look, given what I know
about Atlas,

16:42.269 --> 16:44.404
I'm in as much danger as you.
- Then we're agreed.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.106
We're all in danger.
Can we go now?

16:46.139 --> 16:48.475
- You guys have no idea
what you're up against.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.443
- I think I do,
and I'm not scared.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.145
- You're not scared?
- No.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.646
- Oh, well, you should be.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.383
You think this is some kind
of fair fight?

16:56.416 --> 16:58.285
It doesn't work like that.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.320
Atlas, they're global.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.821
They're everywhere and nowhere.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.623
- All right, now you sound
like Zehnder.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.193
- Zehnder was right,
and now he's dead.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.695
The decide it's your time,
that's it, it's your time,

17:08.728 --> 17:10.363
and never the same way twice.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.099
Every kill is just for you.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.167
If it's messy,
it's supposed to be messy.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.535
Clean, supposed to be clean.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.438
And the minute
you think you're safe...

17:18.471 --> 17:20.407
that's when it happens.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.609
[tense music]

17:22.642 --> 17:24.611
- Come on, let's go.

18:00.247 --> 18:07.287

"In the hour of my death,

18:30.643 --> 18:33.613
"call me and bid me
come into thee.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.582
"That with all thy saints,

18:35.615 --> 18:39.186
I may praise thee
forever and ever."

18:39.219 --> 18:40.720
Amen.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.489
- I think you're ready,
little one.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.624
- That was beautiful.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.493
I'll be back in a little bit.
You guys good?

18:46.526 --> 18:48.495
- Fine.
- We're better than fine, Mommy.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.363
We're amazing.
- Yes, you are.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.765
You are amazing, and it
makes me very happy, mouse.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.901
Estella, I'm very
grateful for you.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.304
Thank you for--
- No need, Julie.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.505
I understand.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.573
- Okay.
- Mommy!

19:00.607 --> 19:03.410
- Yes, sweetie?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.345
- I saw the police car here.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.779
Is everything okay?

19:06.813 --> 19:08.648
- Yeah, don't worry.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.517
Everything's gonna be
just fine very soon, okay?

19:10.550 --> 19:13.786
- Okay.
- Love you.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.523
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.187
- There's your ride.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.361
- Those look like
Mexican cops to you?

19:55.962 --> 19:59.632
- They had
the correct paperwork.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.439
All I know is

20:06.473 --> 20:08.508
you're not our
problem anymore.

20:08.541 --> 20:15.748
*

20:43.643 --> 20:46.012
- You know who I am.

20:46.045 --> 20:50.049
I'm sorry Miss Gregson
was so unaccommodating.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.385
But I do think
I'm much more suited

20:59.326 --> 20:59.492
.

20:59.526 --> 20:59.959
[tense music]

21:02.395 --> 21:06.366
*

21:06.399 --> 21:10.637
- A bit more civilized than
when we met, isn't it?

21:10.670 --> 21:13.306
- What do you want with me?

21:13.340 --> 21:16.042
- I don't know that we need to
jump into what I want from you.

21:16.075 --> 21:20.647
I'd rather start
with what I've given you.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.450
Life, for example.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.521
- So all the charges
are dropped?

21:28.555 --> 21:30.690
- "Dropped" is such
a technical term.

21:30.723 --> 21:35.928
We tend to operate a bit
farther outside the margins.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.530
- So I'm still not free?

21:37.564 --> 21:39.666
- Well, it depends
on how you look at it.

21:39.699 --> 21:44.404
You're not a prisoner;
you're not a fugitive.

21:44.437 --> 21:48.575
But you're right,
the life I've given you

21:48.608 --> 21:50.343
belongs to me.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.945
- And what do you
want me to do with it?

21:52.979 --> 21:56.115
- You have nothing,
by design of course.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.719
No home,
no family, no country.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.988
You don't exist.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.091
- But here am I.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.560
- Mm. Here are we.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.696
- And who is "we"?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.898
- We are Atlas.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.966
You will have
unlimited funding,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.835
unlimited weaponry,

22:15.868 --> 22:19.706
but you must free yourself
of emotion,

22:19.739 --> 22:22.642
of loyalty,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.444
of anger.

22:24.477 --> 22:28.481
- Russians beat us
to our knees.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.518
Slaughter us when we try
to stand up.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.921
My father, mother,

22:34.954 --> 22:39.726
my wife, unborn child.

22:39.759 --> 22:43.863
My loyalty is with my people.

22:43.896 --> 22:47.133
I will never let go of that.

22:47.166 --> 22:50.169
- You think revolution
is about men

22:50.202 --> 22:54.474
and bullets.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.876
Revolution is like
everything else.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.078
It's about money.

23:02.148 --> 23:05.418
- And you will
give me revolution?

23:05.452 --> 23:08.921
- Well, you'll become
a different sort of soldier.

23:08.955 --> 23:13.760
You'll put in your time,
and one day...

23:13.793 --> 23:15.762
We'll talk revolution.

23:15.795 --> 23:20.032
But your anger,
it hasn't served you well.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.034
There's no place for it
in this organization.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.637
Our mission is much
too important.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.039
To be the invisible hand
that maintains order

23:27.073 --> 23:29.442
in a chaotic world.

23:29.476 --> 23:34.681
Mr. Solotov
forgot that invisibility

23:34.714 --> 23:37.183
is essential to our success.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.686
- You want me to kill him.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.921
- What happened
to your wife, Mr. Johnson,

23:41.954 --> 23:43.656
was not my doing.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.458
It was Solotov's doing.

23:45.492 --> 23:48.928
We may not have
a moral code

23:48.961 --> 23:50.897
in a traditional sense,

23:50.930 --> 23:53.866
but there are rules.

23:53.900 --> 23:57.069
We don't kill
indiscriminately.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.706
- How do I know that is true?

23:59.739 --> 24:01.774
- [scoffs]

24:03.009 --> 24:05.678
I will earn your trust.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.647
You will earn mine.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.716
- [chuckles]

24:12.985 --> 24:16.756
I assume there is
only one answer here.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.060
- How do I find him?

24:21.093 --> 24:23.830
- Find Bob Lee Swagger,

24:23.863 --> 24:26.065
you'll find Solotov.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.477
[grunting, yelling]

24:44.917 --> 24:46.719
[gunshot]

24:46.753 --> 24:49.789
[gentle music]

24:49.822 --> 24:52.158
- I figure you're hunkered down
next to those water towers

24:52.191 --> 24:54.060
in a place
you can steady yourself.

- Hey, what's the latest?

25:45.612 --> 25:48.280
- Solotov was set up
in my backyard last night.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.316
- Is he alive to talk about it?

25:50.349 --> 25:52.819
- He is, and now
that I know he's here,

25:52.852 --> 25:56.155
Julie and Mary are gonna
go on a trip.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.090
I'm not gonna say where
over the phone.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.126
- Yeah, I understand.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.928
I can have agents
I trust meet them--

26:01.961 --> 26:03.730
- You're the only agent
I trust. It has to be you.

26:03.763 --> 26:07.033
- You got it.
Let me know where to be.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.235

26:44.170 --> 26:45.838
- Hi.
- What the hell do you want?

26:45.872 --> 26:47.306
- Look, I'm know
I'm not supposed to be here.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.876
Just hear me out, all right?

26:49.909 --> 26:52.712
I brought you something.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.782
I know you like
to go to the range,

26:55.815 --> 26:58.651
so I thought
you'd appreciate this.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.887
It's a 1911
that Earl Swagger carried.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.156
It's a peace offering.
I want you to keep it.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.192
- Wow.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.261
Genuine article
from a genuine war hero.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.397
- Bob Lee keeps it
in great shape.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.701
- Ain't that something?

27:14.734 --> 27:16.869
- If you know who Earl Swagger
is, you know who Bob Lee is,

27:16.903 --> 27:19.405
then you know the story.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.107
Look, my family
has been through hell lately.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.675
I can't go to jail.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.276
It would break my daughter,
all right?

27:24.310 --> 27:26.746
And honestly,
it would break me.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.882
- Well, I sure can
appreciate that.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.285
- Thanks for
your understanding.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.287
- And you know what else
I can appreciate?

27:35.321 --> 27:37.123
Two functioning eardrums!
- Okay, all right--

27:37.156 --> 27:40.192
- If you think you can pay
me off with some crusty pistol,

27:40.226 --> 27:41.894
you're lucky
it ain't loaded, lady.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.429
- If I were you,
I wouldn't go down this road.

27:43.462 --> 27:46.265
- Get off my property.
Now.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.037
I'll end up owning
your whole goddamn ranch

27:51.070 --> 27:53.072
before this is over.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.474
Thanks for the pistol!

27:55.507 --> 27:58.845
Damn all you Swaggers to hell!

27:58.878 --> 28:05.918
*

28:17.363 --> 28:20.332
- [sighs]
Come on.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.035
- We're almost to the freeway.
We're gonna be fine.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.237
- [sighs]

28:35.047 --> 28:36.816
[ominous music]

28:36.849 --> 28:37.483
[horn honking]

28:37.516 --> 28:39.085
- Look at her stuff.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.788
- What?

28:41.821 --> 28:43.823
- She's too clean.
Something's off.

28:43.856 --> 28:47.159
- Yeah, go, go, go.
Go, go!

28:47.193 --> 28:48.360
[tires squeal]

28:48.394 --> 28:52.431
*

28:53.800 --> 28:56.102
- What the hell
are you doing, Solotov?

28:56.135 --> 28:58.370
- Bob Lee. Hey.
- Hey.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.973
You look great.
- Thanks.

29:01.007 --> 29:02.474
- Is everything okay?

29:02.508 --> 29:04.376
- Yeah, I'm fine,
but you need to shower.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.878
We gotta get
to church, all right?

29:05.912 --> 29:07.814
I mean, Mary's already
in her dress,

29:07.847 --> 29:09.982
so I have 30 seconds before
she draws all over it.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.483
Train's leaving.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.853
- Yeah, fine, babe.
I'm moving.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.421
Uh, why don't you guys
go ahead?

29:15.454 --> 29:18.290
- Without you?
- No, no, no, no, before me.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.492
You know how they have
all that pre-stuff

29:20.526 --> 29:22.461
and Father D
talks to the kids.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.296
- Please don't screw this up.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.999
- I'm getting
in the shower right now.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.104
- Take your pick.

29:32.138 --> 29:35.274
Get you all the ammo you need.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.810
- I won't need much.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.913
- We sent three men last time.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.481
They're all dead.

29:44.616 --> 29:48.087
- I heard I got this job
'cause no one wanted it.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.389
- That's right.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.025
- He have any weaknesses
I can exploit?

29:53.059 --> 29:57.029
- His only mistake was
thinking that he could retire,

29:57.063 --> 29:59.065
walk away from it.

29:59.098 --> 30:03.502
Once you get on this path,
you never get off.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.380
- Hey.
- Bob Lee.

30:14.413 --> 30:19.251
Look, you know I respect
the hell out of you,

30:19.285 --> 30:21.053
but Julie can't
come back here.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.322
Sheriff has been up my ass
about what happened.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.457
- I'm not here for that.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.094
You sell any of these lately?

30:28.127 --> 30:30.396
- Hmm. No.
Why you asking?

30:30.429 --> 30:32.064
- Personal reasons.

30:32.098 --> 30:35.167
- Yeah, well, I'll keep
an eye out for you of course,

30:35.201 --> 30:38.604
but I ain't seen anything
like that on this range.

30:38.637 --> 30:41.874
Some guys use 'em to hold
T&E mechanisms.

30:41.908 --> 30:45.411
Works like bench shooting,
but it's a lot more mobile.

30:45.444 --> 30:49.215
Set your horizontal,
vertical, lock it in.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.317
- So if somebody had
an injured hand,

30:51.350 --> 30:53.585
they could use this and still
stay steady on the long gun?

30:53.619 --> 30:56.088
- Oh, yeah.
Sure could.

30:56.122 --> 30:59.258
Does, uh--does this
have something to do

30:59.291 --> 31:02.528
with your wife's friend?

31:02.561 --> 31:05.164
- What friend?

31:05.197 --> 31:06.966
- Well, no, no, I ain't, uh--

31:06.999 --> 31:09.001
I ain't seen nothing
inappropriate.

31:09.035 --> 31:12.171
I have to be clear they
just hit the range together

31:12.204 --> 31:15.641
once in a while is all--
- What friend, Gary?

31:15.674 --> 31:18.177
- His name is Travis.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.246
He's right-handed, see,

31:20.279 --> 31:22.114
but he busted up
his shooting hand,

31:22.148 --> 31:23.983
so a T&E would do him right.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.685
- Is he 5'10",
thin, dark hair, accent?

31:26.718 --> 31:29.321
- Well, you got
the height right,

31:29.355 --> 31:31.523
but this guy's got
light hair and goatee

31:31.557 --> 31:33.993
and said he's
a travelling salesman.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.062
Why? You think
you know him, Bob Lee?

31:39.698 --> 31:40.032
.

31:40.066 --> 31:40.632
- That with all thy saints,

31:42.268 --> 31:45.972
I may pray to thee
forever and ever.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.306
Amen.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.475
- My children,

31:49.508 --> 31:52.444
God called you
by your name at your baptism.

31:52.478 --> 31:56.248
And now the way to full
communion lies before you.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.418
Set your feet firmly
onto this path.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.420
Are you ready
to begin your journey,

32:01.453 --> 32:03.389
trusting Jesus
to be your guide?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.657
[together] We are!
- Yes.

32:05.691 --> 32:09.461
Yes, I think you are.
Form a line.

32:19.571 --> 32:23.009

32:28.480 --> 32:35.354
*

32:35.387 --> 32:37.556
- Come on, pick up the phone!

32:37.589 --> 32:39.225
Pick up the goddamn phone!

32:39.258 --> 32:46.098
*

32:47.566 --> 32:49.468
- The body of Christ.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.337
*

32:51.370 --> 32:52.671
- Amen.

32:52.704 --> 32:56.175

33:53.499 --> 33:55.767
The body of Christ.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.503
- You're late.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.171
- What the hell
are you doing here?

33:59.205 --> 34:02.374
- Your wife invited me.
- The body of Christ.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.444
- I will kill you right here.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.581
- I think not.

34:09.615 --> 34:12.651
And there's another one
under the altar.

34:12.684 --> 34:15.221
I've got a dead man's switch
on my wrist, Swagger.

34:15.254 --> 34:18.357
If I die, you die,
and so does everyone you love.

34:18.390 --> 34:21.793
[tense music]

34:21.827 --> 34:27.733
*

34:27.766 --> 34:29.201
- Come on.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.537
Why are we stopping?
- All right, just relax.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.673
*

34:34.706 --> 34:36.775
- That car's been
behind us the whole time.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.610
I don't like this.
- Look, stay low.

34:38.644 --> 34:42.148
The highway's right there.
We can make it.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.815
Tio!

34:55.861 --> 34:58.297
Get out of here!
Keep your phone on.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.566
Hey, hey, hey.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.202
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.640
Tio.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.576
We're here.
Tio?

35:10.609 --> 35:12.711
Tio, Tio, shit!
Tio!

35:12.744 --> 35:14.680

Get an ambulance now!

35:14.713 --> 35:16.582
Tio!
Tio, stay with me.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.551
Tio.
Come on, give me a name.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.420
A name, Tio.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.755
- William Hayes.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.557
- Hayes knows about Atlas?

35:25.591 --> 35:29.161
- Hayes is Atlas.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.329
- Tio!

35:30.362 --> 35:32.198
Tio, come on!
Stay with me.

Tio! Tio!

35:41.773 --> 35:44.510
- You want Atlas?
- That's right.

35:44.543 --> 35:47.513
- Not just your accounts.
All of it.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.681
- Money cannot
buy you everything,

35:49.715 --> 35:51.450
but it can buy you...

35:51.483 --> 35:54.286
- Revenge.
- Justice.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.623
Look at me, Swagger.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.426
Look at me.

36:00.459 --> 36:03.862
I'm in Texas.

36:03.895 --> 36:07.366
I hurt them most
by taking everything.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.268
And then I am in the wind.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.403
Then perhaps...

36:11.437 --> 36:13.639
Rebirth.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.478
- Okay, here.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.980
Here.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.850
We're leaving.
I'll give you everything.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.486
Then you can do
whatever you need to to me.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.321
Just don't do this.

36:29.355 --> 36:33.225
Not here, not to them.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.294
- I accept.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.940
[tense music swells]

*

37:02.821 --> 37:03.355

that through these--

37:05.023 --> 37:07.293
[gunfire]

37:07.326 --> 37:08.894
- Stay down.
Stay down.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.462
need you
to stay down, okay?

37:10.496 --> 37:13.031
Listen, come here.
I need you--

37:13.064 --> 37:14.800
Come back here.
Can you watch her?

37:14.833 --> 37:17.769
- Stay inside.
- Stay here, don't move.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.805
I'll be right back, I promise.
Stay here.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.541
Excuse me.

37:28.914 --> 37:32.284
- Get up, get up.
Tell him.

37:34.052 --> 37:36.388
Tell him, Swagger.
Tell him.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.789
- He's wearing a bomb!

37:37.823 --> 37:39.891
And there's another
in the church!

38:10.922 --> 38:12.724
- What happened? What happened?
- Julie, go back inside.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.393
- No, I need to know
who was shot.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.994
Was Bob Lee shot?
- It's not safe.

38:16.027 --> 38:18.697
- Tell me, please.
- Julie--

38:20.866 --> 38:22.067
Julie, Julie.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.869
- Mary.
- Mommy.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.338
- Sweetheart, listen, we need
to go, all right?

38:26.372 --> 38:27.839
Come on, follow me.
- Where's Daddy?

38:27.873 --> 38:29.007
- We're gonna go get him.
- Julie, stay here.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.376
- No, I'm sorry, Father.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.110
- Please--
- Come on, Mary.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.012
- Can I help you?
- No.

38:34.045 --> 38:36.448
- Ma'am.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.986
- What the hell?
I told you not--

38:41.019 --> 38:43.789
- Not here for you.
I'm here for your boss.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.094
- Well, come on in.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.962
- Senator Hayes.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.131
- Agent Memphis.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.935
We have a lot to discuss.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.037

38:59.070 --> 39:00.739

39:05.076 --> 39:09.448
Deep breath.
One, two, three.

39:09.481 --> 39:10.882
- [groaning]

39:21.059 --> 39:22.861
- You all packed up, mouse?

39:22.894 --> 39:25.431
- Yeah.
Is Daddy coming, too?

39:25.464 --> 39:26.598
- Yes, he's on his way.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.734

*

39:51.757 --> 39:53.625
What the hell
are you doing here?

39:53.659 --> 39:55.060
- Solotov has Bob Lee.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.762
- How do you know?
Were you at the church?

39:56.795 --> 39:58.797
- Yeah, trying to kill
that bastard.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.499
I shot Bob Lee.

40:00.532 --> 40:04.002
I had Solotov in my sights.
He was wearing a suicide vest.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.871
Bob Lee jumped in front of him,
took the bullet.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.739
- Shit.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.642
- What the hell was Solotov
doing at the church?

40:10.676 --> 40:13.078
- I invited him there.
I met him at the range.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.713
He said his name was Travis,

40:14.746 --> 40:18.116
and I was just
dumb enough to believe him.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.786
- He ever get near
your phone?

40:20.819 --> 40:22.020
- Shit.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.155
- Give me.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.957
He tapped it.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.527
NSA trick.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.198
That's why he was
always ahead of us.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.200
All right,
Bob Lee is wounded.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.702
That means we're on a clock.

40:36.735 --> 40:39.671
And Solotov took him
because he needs him.

40:39.705 --> 40:42.508
You confident with that 1911?

40:42.541 --> 40:44.910
- You want me to show you?

40:44.943 --> 40:48.980
- I know you don't trust me,
but I gotta finish this.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.718
And I could use your help.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.494
- When I have
what I need, Swagger,

41:02.528 --> 41:05.564
then you can die.

41:05.597 --> 41:09.234
Until then,
we are bound together.
