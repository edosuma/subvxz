WEBVTT

00:05.630 --> 00:08.091
Oh, hey. Heyyyy, roomie.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.467
You know, it's, uh--
it's so crazy

00:09.467 --> 00:10.719
that we've been living together
for a few months

00:10.719 --> 00:12.595
and I don't even know
what city you were born in.

00:12.595 --> 00:15.098
That's not crazy.
I was born in Cleveland.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.851
Cool. So as a kid in Cleveland,
did you have any pets?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.894
Yeah. I had a hamster
named Hamster.

00:19.894 --> 00:22.230
Adorable. Last question. What's
your mother's maiden name?

00:22.230 --> 00:23.273
- No.
- What?

00:23.273 --> 00:24.941
You're trying to steal
my Hulu password.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.192
No, I'm not trying to...

00:26.192 --> 00:27.777
That's identity theft, Nell.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.739
Come on! Everybody does it.
It's not a big deal.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.450
It's like stealing
a fun glass from a bar

00:33.450 --> 00:35.910
or sneaking a roasted chicken
into a movie theater.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.371
As a lawyer, I'm gonna recommend
that you quit talking

00:38.371 --> 00:39.998
before you confess
to any more crimes.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.833
Speaking of crimes,

00:41.833 --> 00:44.210
I've noticed you use a lot of
toilet paper in the bathroom.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.755
Now, I wasn't gonna say anything
because, frankly,

00:46.755 --> 00:48.340
I-- I don't know
where to begin.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.759
But I think it would be best
if you could please

00:50.759 --> 00:52.886
just keep the bathroom stocked.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.139
Okay, listen, I'll amortize
my share from the...

00:56.139 --> 00:57.807
What is-- What are--

00:57.807 --> 00:59.142
What are you doing?

00:59.142 --> 01:01.144
Um, I'm packing my lunch.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.812
That's not lunch.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.440
That's oyster crackers
and a jar of peanut butter.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.025
I don't get paid until Friday.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.693
And I'm three payments behind
on my student loans.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.278
So I'm gonna have to make do.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.615
Thank God I picked
these tomatillos

01:13.615 --> 01:14.866
from the community garden.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.201
We don't have
a community garden.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.286
You just picked that
from somebody's yard.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.455
Oh, call the produce police.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.539
Bye!

01:21.539 --> 01:24.626
It's a slippery slope
from tomatoes to banks.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.922
Oh.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.216
"Dear Nell," blah, blah, blah.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.843
"Your next obituary
assignment is"-- Oh!

01:33.843 --> 01:35.011
Wow,

01:35.011 --> 01:36.971
that was a close call.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.181
Oh, my God.
I know that voice.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.976
This is the voice
of the Fresno Grizzlies,

01:41.976 --> 01:43.144
- Car--
- Carlos Garza!

01:44.312 --> 01:46.106
Carlos Garza!
Oh, my God!

01:46.106 --> 01:47.982
My dad I used to listen
to you call baseball games

01:47.982 --> 01:49.401
all the time!

01:49.401 --> 01:51.820
I can't believe you're dead!
That is amazing!

01:51.820 --> 01:53.488
- Hurtful.
- Oh, no, no.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.531
I didn't mean it like that.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.449
I just meant that, like,
you know...

01:56.449 --> 01:57.534
I've always wanted
to meet you.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.744
So, you know, say something,
just anything.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.497
- Keep your eyes on the road.
- Oh, yeah. Don't worry.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.332
That's it, though. That's
exactly what you sound like.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.959
Oh!

02:07.877 --> 02:11.339
Two car crashes in one day.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.758
Tough day for Carlos Garza.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.143
Yeah, I canceled my AAA,

02:23.143 --> 02:25.729
so this tow truck's gonna
cost me about, uh,

02:25.729 --> 02:27.856
- 300 bucks that I don't have.
- Hm.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.026
Speaking of AAA,
this reminds me of a pitcher

02:31.026 --> 02:32.485
- from the Toledo Mud Hens.
- Mm.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.987
This guy was older than Moses,

02:33.987 --> 02:36.364
committed three errors
on one play.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.825
Yet, the old southpaw managed
to turn things around

02:38.825 --> 02:40.243
and get the win.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.162
Man, you always have
the perfect baseball story

02:42.162 --> 02:43.455
for every situation.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.539
We'd always have you on
at the kitchen

02:44.539 --> 02:45.707
in my family's restaurant.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.000
Or-- Or, in the summer,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.960
we'd bring the radio with us
to the stadium

02:48.960 --> 02:50.837
just to, like, listen to you
when we watched the game.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.049
You really brought me
and my dad closer together.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.926
Yeah. Oh.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.595
- Nope.
- Hmm.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.722
I can see you're still
very close.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.390
No, we are.
Now is just not a good time.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.475
Hm.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.226
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:05.226 --> 03:10.273
this one is going,
going, gone.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.234
I am just so grateful
that you didn't get hurt.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.402
I mean, this is why
I always tell you

03:14.402 --> 03:15.987
to keep your eyes
on the road.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.947
FYI, the light is green.

03:17.947 --> 03:18.990
Huh? Oh.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.450
- Mm. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.953
- So, you doing okay?
- Yeah.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.580
I got coffee in my bra.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.624
Oh, and I might have to start
driving Uber on the weekends.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.918
But, uh, now I don't have
a car, so...

03:29.918 --> 03:31.586
maybe they'll let me carry
people from place to place.

03:33.922 --> 03:34.964
Oh.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.883
Oh, of course my dad
keeps calling me today,

03:36.883 --> 03:38.134
on all days.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.803
Well, maybe you could just
ask him for some money.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.137
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't think so.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.472
Mnh-mnh.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.432
Yeah, if I pick up,
he's gonna want to catch up.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.892
And then I'm gonna
ruin the illusion

03:45.892 --> 03:48.728
that his little superstar
is actually broke,

03:48.728 --> 03:49.771
living with a roommate,

03:49.771 --> 03:51.606
and stealing vegetables
like Peter Rabbit.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.358
This is all temporary, okay?

03:53.358 --> 03:56.111
And from where I'm sitting,
you are doing all right,

03:56.111 --> 03:58.571
even with that coffee
on your bra.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.741
I hope we get away
to the Bahamas.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.992
All right, if you can
figure it out.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.704
I'm gonna look for a--

04:05.704 --> 04:07.580
Attention, everybody.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.623
I have an air horn.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.167
And also an announcement
to make.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.961
My father wants all employees

04:12.961 --> 04:15.714
to undergo performance reviews.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.174
I know he can be intimidating.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.468
But good news--

04:20.468 --> 04:22.095
He's not going
to be present...

04:22.095 --> 04:23.513
...in person.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.724
He is going to be present
on a speaker.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.685
But we're going to make it fun!
Mason?

04:29.561 --> 04:31.354
Every employee's name
has been written

04:31.354 --> 04:33.023
on one of these
ping-pong balls

04:33.023 --> 04:35.984
by my personal
calligraphist, Chaz.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.944
Now, when I pull your ball,
you're going to meet me

04:37.944 --> 04:40.071
in the conference room
for a little chitchat.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.573
Fun, right?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.950
Heyyyy. What's going on?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.618
My father
wants me to make budget cuts.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.120
I think I might have to
lay someone off.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.997
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. It's bad.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.665
It's really, really bad.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.709
Love the big jewelry, Tina.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.919
10 out of 10!

04:54.919 --> 04:56.087
Everyone's gonna hate me.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.672
And I don't know how
to pull myself out of it.

04:57.672 --> 05:01.384
Okay, well, all you have to do
is just take a deep breath

05:01.384 --> 05:03.511
and be honest with everyone
and tell them the truth.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.388
I can't do that,
and neither can you.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.890
Okay? Just smile.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.683
Party!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.687
The paper's cutting costs, people.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.148
It's only a matter of time
until they cut jobs, too.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.484
Good thing I'm the only one here
who doesn't get paid.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.651
You're also the only one here

05:18.651 --> 05:20.028
that's still on
a learner's permit.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.905
What?

05:23.198 --> 05:26.868
Screw this place.
I'm taking whatever I want.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.162
Whoa.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.747
- You okay?
- Yeah.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.333
Just, I don't like
performance reviews.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.001
- Oh.
- Not really good with criticism.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.419
Plus, when I get nervous,
I tend to ramble.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.464
Well, not so much ramble
as prattle or blabber.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.299
Pratter, even.
Is that a word, "pratter"?

05:41.299 --> 05:42.592
- Mnh-mnh.
- I think I'm rambling.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.552
- Am I rambling?
- 100%.
- Oh.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.180
- Dennis.
- Ohhh!

05:47.180 --> 05:48.598
Okay. No, this is good,
this is good.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.558
I'm going first.
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid.

05:50.558 --> 05:53.645
Why do people say that?
That hurts so much.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.230
Oh, God,
I'm rambling again.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.442
I know my father
can be intimidating,

05:59.442 --> 06:02.946
even from 5,000 miles away,
but don't let it rattle you.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.656
Just pretend he's not even
in the room,

06:04.656 --> 06:09.285
listening and judging every
single thing you're saying.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.621
<i>Mr. Rhodes
has joined the call.</i>

06:11.621 --> 06:13.164
Uh, hello.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.749
Mr. Rhodes,
it's such a pleasure

06:14.749 --> 06:16.584
to finally meet you
over the speaker box.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.256
Don't be alarmed.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.799
He didn't speak to me
from the ages of 8 to 11

06:22.799 --> 06:24.634
because I had braces.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.803
Okay, Dennis,
let's get into it.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.223
How would you summarize your
performance over the past year?

06:30.223 --> 06:33.810
Uh, yes. Um, I-I can
definitely do that.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.814
Um, our-- our clicks are up.
Ad sales up.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.526
A-And we uncovered a sex cult
at the Alhambra Public Library.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.610
The end.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.238
Well, kudos to you.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.990
Keep up the good work.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.992
- Is that it?
- Yes.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.161
I mean, unless you wanted
to say something else?

06:51.161 --> 06:54.080
No. (laughing) No.
Thank you. Thank you, Lexi.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.999
And-- And-- And thank you,
Mr. Rhodes.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.459
I appreciate the opportunity.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.169
Um, and I love you.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.633
I, uh...

07:05.633 --> 07:07.135
I gotta go job.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.845
Mm-hmm.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.268
- Ah.
- Toilet paper?

07:15.268 --> 07:16.561
I haven't seen
a steal this brazen

07:16.561 --> 07:18.813
since fleet-footed Dave Roberts
stole second base

07:18.813 --> 07:20.690
against the Yankees
in the ALCS.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.484
Can you cool it
with the color commentary?

07:22.484 --> 07:24.194
My life sucks,
and I might lose my job.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.695
I thought you liked
my storytelling.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.155
I did--
When I was a kid

07:27.155 --> 07:28.698
and it was about the players
and not me.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.700
I really don't need
a play-by-play of my failures.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.743
Mm-hmm. I'll stop.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.412
For what it's worth,
things could always be worse.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.373
I don't even know
how that's possible.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.795
Dad?!

07:41.795 --> 07:45.715
Now, that is
a beautiful curveball.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.763
There's my superstar.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.640
Dad.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.808
- Ah.
- Ah.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.018
Your mom wants to give you this.
Mwah!

07:57.018 --> 07:59.020
- And this.
- Hey!

07:59.020 --> 08:00.980
She says that's for not visiting
since you got back.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.775
- I visited.
- Once. And that was months ago.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.694
But work's been keeping me busy,
you know?

08:05.694 --> 08:08.488
But don't worry.
Everything is good.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.156
I'm over this dump.
- Oh, wait.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.991
So what brings you,
uh, down here, Dad?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.410
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.453
I had to meet with one of
our suppliers to the restaurant.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.247
- Oh.
- I called you a couple of times

08:17.247 --> 08:18.289
to see if you were
free for lunch,

08:18.289 --> 08:20.208
but when I didn't
hear from you,

08:20.208 --> 08:21.376
I just thought, "You know what?

08:21.376 --> 08:22.794
I'm just gonna show up."

08:23.962 --> 08:25.630
And-- oh, my God--
Carlos Garza.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.966
- Oh.
- Talk about one of the greats.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.884
I like this guy. Class act.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.261
I met him, you know,
a few years ago.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.929
- He came to the restaurant.
- Yeah?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.180
He said my pasteles were...

08:34.180 --> 08:36.016
The best he'd ever tasted.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.142
I'm sure they were delicious,

08:37.142 --> 08:39.144
but I say that to everyone
to get free food.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.229
You know what, Dad?
It's like he's still here.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.106
I'm-- I'm writing
his obituary.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.858
Th-They usually put me
on more important things.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.151
They just wanted to make sure
that, you know,

08:46.151 --> 08:47.485
they got the job done right.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.612
Wow, <i>mírate.</i>

08:49.612 --> 08:51.322
That's my superstar.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.117
Hey, since I'm here, which one
of these offices is yours?

08:54.117 --> 08:57.746
I want to see
where the magic happens.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.372
- You do?
- Yeah.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.332
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.375
Uh, I'll show you, Dad.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.753
Come on. It's just, uh,
right over here.

09:04.753 --> 09:05.837
Yeah, right this way, Dad.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.089
Um... I'll, uh...

09:10.884 --> 09:12.927
- Ahh!
- I always knew you were
gonna be a big success

09:12.927 --> 09:14.137
when you were a little girl.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.722
- Oh.
- Banging out those stories

09:15.722 --> 09:17.182
on your toy typewriter.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.850
Yeah, well, now I have
a computer,

09:18.850 --> 09:21.811
but, unfortunately, no bubbles
come out when I press the keys.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.898
Hey! Oh, hey!

09:24.898 --> 09:26.691
Mr. Serrano.
I didn't know you were in town.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.360
Did Nell know you were in town?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.028
If she picked up her phone,
she would have.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.448
Sam, I can't believe
you're a mom now.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.866
- Yeah.
- Show me some pictures.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.242
Sure.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.455
Nell, do you know
where my picture frames are?

09:40.455 --> 09:42.123
I think they're in your cubicle.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.042
Not sure why they'd be
in my office.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.336
You're right. You're right.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.963
How silly of me.
I just love those pictures.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.548
I just carry them around
all the time

09:50.548 --> 09:51.966
and leave them
in other people's offices.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.260
Quick quesht.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.471
Has anyone ever
told their boss "I love you"

09:56.471 --> 09:57.722
totally unprompted?

09:57.722 --> 10:00.558
Asking for a-- myself.
I just did that.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.310
Dennis, you remember my dad, right?

10:02.310 --> 10:03.353
You guys met a few years ago?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.105
- Yes! Mr. Serrano!
- Hi.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.440
Good to see you.
Why are you sitting there?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.192
It's my chair.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.112
And this is my desk
and my pencils-- pen.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.405
My pens.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.906
And, you know, because this--

10:14.906 --> 10:17.992
is my three hard-boiled eggs
for lunch.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.411
Ugh!

10:19.411 --> 10:21.788
I really respect
your relationship to protein.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.164
Mm-hmm.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.374
Yes.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.668
Dad, why don't we go outside
and get some air, yeah?

10:26.668 --> 10:28.461
Yeah.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.754
The newspaper business is solid.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.007
- Life is great.
- Oh, I never worry about you.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.175
- Your brother,
on the other hand.
- Oh, no.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.052
Did he accidentally start
another pyramid scheme?

10:36.052 --> 10:38.596
No, but I still have
a garage full of shampoo,

10:38.596 --> 10:40.140
if you're interested
in losing your hair.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.474
No, thanks.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.268
Basically, I was thinking

10:43.268 --> 10:45.270
I might take a step back
at the restaurant

10:45.270 --> 10:46.771
and let him take over.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.356
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.026
I mean, I don't know
what else to do with him.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.652
- Mm.
- Maybe he'll get his life

10:52.652 --> 10:55.071
- together, for once.
- Well, I mean, come on.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.449
It's not all his fault, right?

10:57.449 --> 10:58.783
Sometimes things are
out of your control,

10:58.783 --> 11:01.036
and people get
knocked off their path,

11:01.036 --> 11:03.747
and they just need a-a minute
to get back on it.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.499
- No. I think he might
just be an idiot.
- Mm.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.126
Not like my successful daughter

11:08.126 --> 11:11.463
with her corner office
and her fancy job.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.090
Well, that's me,
who is... not an idiot.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.092
Almost too successful.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.639
I decided to go with
the smaller apartment,

11:21.639 --> 11:24.225
you know,
for historical significance.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.561
Rumor has it David Lee Roth
once lived here.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.938
Ah!

11:28.938 --> 11:30.899
I don't know who that is,
but I'm impressed.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.150
Oh, well, let me
go change real quick,

11:32.150 --> 11:34.069
- and then
we'll grab a bite, hmm?
- Okay.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.782
Isn't this great?

11:40.408 --> 11:41.576
Sam!

11:41.576 --> 11:42.952
Oh.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.412
This is going to be easy.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.332
Just easy-squeezy, okay?

11:47.332 --> 11:49.334
Oh, I am so relieved
to hear you say that.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.086
I was actually
kind of nervous about it.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.128
I don't know why.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.172
I think it's 'cause Keith is
just trying to develop this app,

11:54.172 --> 11:55.715
- and I'm like--
- Um, I don't need

11:55.715 --> 11:57.926
to hear about
your personal life, Ms. Holkar.

11:57.926 --> 11:58.968
Dad.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.304
Oh. Okay.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.726
- Thanks, Lexi.
- Bup-bup-bup!

12:06.726 --> 12:08.895
Please just stick
to your performance review.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.313
All right.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.441
Uh, well, I think that
my performance overall

12:13.441 --> 12:15.026
has been very positive,

12:15.026 --> 12:16.945
especially in light of
the fact that...

12:18.279 --> 12:22.033
...we have, uh, lost
two reporters this year.

12:22.033 --> 12:25.578
But Lifestyle will continue
to grow and improve.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.455
- Um...
- Well, it's not good enough,

12:27.455 --> 12:29.457
but I suppose it's going
to have to do.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.792
You can go now.

12:30.792 --> 12:31.876
Thank you.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.342
Ah, so I'm-- Edward.
What are you doing here?

12:39.342 --> 12:40.760
I just met your dad.
He's great.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.970
You didn't tell me
you had a roommate.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.722
I was just telling him
how relieved I am

12:43.722 --> 12:46.141
that you were not hurt
during your car accident,

12:46.141 --> 12:48.560
even though it sucks
that you don't have
the money to pay for it

12:48.560 --> 12:51.062
and then you had to go to work
after to write obituaries

12:51.062 --> 12:53.481
at your dumpy, little cubicle.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.025
I did mention
the vegetable stealing,

12:55.025 --> 12:56.401
but that's only because
I thought maybe

12:56.401 --> 12:57.569
he would want to
speak with you about it.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.237
Dad, I know this sounds bad.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.614
All right, I'm going to
excuse myself.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.199
Thank you.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.785
- So you're broke...
- Eh--

13:05.785 --> 13:08.413
...that wasn't your office,
and you got in a car accident?

13:08.413 --> 13:10.498
It wasn't that bad.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.459
I really just have to replace,
like, the front half of the car.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.461
- You've been lying
about your life.
- Uh...

13:14.461 --> 13:16.796
Is this why you've barely come
to visit since you've been back?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.173
I just didn't want
you guys to worry.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.133
And things have been tougher
than expected,

13:20.133 --> 13:21.760
but it's gonna be okay.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.595
You know, I'm working really
hard to get myself out of it.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.847
Nell, it doesn't have to be
so hard.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.849
You can come home
and run the restaurant.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.768
- No.
- I always wanted it
to be you, anyway.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.811
But you had these big dreams
you were chasing,

13:31.811 --> 13:33.772
and I-I didn't want
to get in the way.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.441
- But if it's not working out--
- Dad--

13:36.441 --> 13:37.567
Listen to me.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.818
You could have some stability,

13:38.818 --> 13:40.236
afford your own place to live,

13:40.236 --> 13:41.821
and you could be
near your family.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.704
Dad, I'm sorry for lying, but
it's-- I'm going to be fine.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.247
Penelope,
can you honestly tell me

13:51.247 --> 13:52.624
this is the life that you want?

13:53.917 --> 13:56.461
And as the slugger steps up
to the plate,

13:56.461 --> 14:00.215
she faces the question,
does she like her job?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.050
Does she like
her living situation?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.718
Uh...

14:03.718 --> 14:06.554
Does she like some dead guy
asking these questions?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.648
How you feeling, champ?

14:16.648 --> 14:20.819
Uh, I-I just can't stop
thinking about what my dad said.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.529
You know, like, I--

14:22.529 --> 14:24.656
I can't find a reason
not to agree with him.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.825
If I move back home
and I work for the restaurant,

14:26.825 --> 14:28.618
my life would be easier.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.705
Dads are like umpires.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.206
You hate them
when they get it wrong.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.960
But 99 times out of 100...

14:36.960 --> 14:39.879
they get it right.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.506
You know what's funny?

14:41.506 --> 14:43.049
I have this memory of a game.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.844
Me and my dad
are in the cheap seats,

14:45.844 --> 14:47.220
'cause they're the rowdiest
and the most fun.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.016
You know, I got my Cracker Jacks
and my hot dog,

14:51.016 --> 14:53.476
- and my dad's got his beer
and you on the radio.
- Oh.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.813
It's the bottom of the 7th.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.690
Lorenzo Gomez steps up
to the plate,

14:58.690 --> 15:00.358
and he really connects, right?

15:00.358 --> 15:02.736
And I-I see the ball
leave his bat,

15:02.736 --> 15:04.195
and I watch it fly
through the air,

15:04.195 --> 15:07.741
and I just know
it's headed right towards me.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.826
So I-I close my eyes,
I open my glove,

15:09.826 --> 15:12.871
and it lands smack
in the middle of it.

15:13.830 --> 15:17.125
And it was just the best moment

15:17.125 --> 15:18.793
because I was
in the exact right place

15:18.793 --> 15:20.545
at the exact right time.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.713
Mm-hmm.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.758
From then on, I always
felt that way, you know?

15:24.758 --> 15:28.011
Right place, right time...

15:29.721 --> 15:30.680
Till now.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.185
Oh, I don't know about that.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.436
Huh.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.148
You took me right back
to the cheap seats in '94.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.109
I call 'em like I see 'em.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.446
And you're a storyteller.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.910
No matter what you decide to do,

15:51.910 --> 15:54.788
I'm glad you're the one
who's telling mine.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.333
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.504
That's cool.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.885
Okay.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.680
773N.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.847
Nope.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.227
That makes more sense. Nell.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.815
Nell, Nell, Nell.
Where should we begin?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.316
I'll start.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.068
I was gonna come in here
and tell you to fire me.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.778
That would be amazing.
Go on.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.321
But I can't do that.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.448
Just because I'm living off
of oyster crackers

16:30.448 --> 16:31.866
doesn't mean that I need to go

16:31.866 --> 16:33.660
and run a Puerto Rican
restaurant in Fresno.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.496
That's oddly specific. Proceed.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.789
I'm going to stay here
at the paper,

16:37.789 --> 16:41.001
and I'm gonna keep doing what
I love-- telling stories.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.503
Now, I-I don't know
if you know this, Mr. Rhodes,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.839
but that's what everybody here
is trying to do.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.173
And it-- And it really sucks

16:47.173 --> 16:48.633
that you're making us
jump through hoops

16:48.633 --> 16:50.385
with these stupid
performance reviews.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.012
We don't need more pressure

16:52.012 --> 16:53.763
than the pressure
we put on ourselves.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.186
- Mr. Rhodes?
- Papá?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.439
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

17:02.439 --> 17:05.650
<i>Mr. Rhodes hasn't been on
the call for quite some time.</i>

17:05.650 --> 17:07.027
<i>He instructed me to cough
every now and then</i>

17:07.027 --> 17:08.778
<i>so you wouldn't know.</i>

17:08.778 --> 17:10.363
<i>But please don't tell him.
I-I don't want to be fired.</i>

17:10.363 --> 17:12.449
<i>I really need this job.</i>

17:12.449 --> 17:13.533
Well...

17:13.533 --> 17:14.659
- Whew!
- This is embarrassing.

17:14.659 --> 17:17.328
I'm sorry your little screed
fell on deaf ears.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.663
- Eh.
<i>- For what it's worth,</i>

17:18.663 --> 17:20.707
<i>I found both you ladies
to be very--</i>

17:21.750 --> 17:23.543
Oh, goodness.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.046
I can't believe my dad is trying
to get me to make layoffs

17:26.046 --> 17:28.214
and couldn't even be bothered
to be on the calls himself.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.383
It's just so... typical.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.261
I don't want to fire people.
I hate being the bad guy.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.555
Really? 'Cause you're
really good at it.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.141
And the crazy part is,
I've been trying so hard

17:38.141 --> 17:40.894
to prove to him that I'm doing
a good job, and for what?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.063
To be the boss
with perfect teeth

17:43.063 --> 17:45.523
who's despised by her employees?

17:45.523 --> 17:48.234
Ah, I get that.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.695
I don't want to disappoint
my dad, either.

17:50.695 --> 17:54.741
Maybe, sometimes,
we gotta wave off the signs

17:54.741 --> 17:57.994
and swing for the fences,
even if it's a 3-0 count.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.579
Mm.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.373
Is that some kind of code
or something?

18:02.874 --> 18:04.250
I'm just saying,

18:04.250 --> 18:05.627
you gotta do
what's right for you.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.630
We both do.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.841
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.927
You can do now, 773N.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.767
That was incredible.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.519
I'm glad you're gonna
stay in the game.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.104
Well, you inspired me.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.064
Oh, kid, it was my pleasure.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.774
- Just remember to keep swinging.
- Mm-hmm.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.860
You'll find your way back
to the big leagues soon enough.

18:33.363 --> 18:36.366
Everyone,
I have an announcement.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.951
I'm sure some of you
have heard a rumor

18:37.951 --> 18:40.120
that the performance reviews
were leading to layoffs.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.541
Let me be the first to tell you
that this rumor is correct.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.586
You're coming with me, Key-bo.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.339
What I meant to say was,

18:51.339 --> 18:54.467
this rumor was
absolutely correct.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.094
My father did want layoffs.

18:56.094 --> 19:00.473
But I have found a way
to avoid making that happen.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.435
Everyone is keeping their jobs.

19:06.396 --> 19:10.483
How did you manage
to save everyone's jobs?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.152
I had my father fired.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.112
He probably won't discover it
for several weeks,

19:14.112 --> 19:16.156
and when he does, boy,
will he be furious.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.867
But please don't tell anyone,
and smile for everyone, Sam.

19:18.867 --> 19:19.909
Thank you.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.998
<i>"When I was a little
girl, I thought Carlos Garza</i>

19:24.998 --> 19:27.292
<i>was calling baseball games
just for me.</i>

19:27.292 --> 19:29.836
<i>He got you to hold your breath
with every at-bat</i>

19:29.836 --> 19:32.213
<i>and to fall in love
with each player's story.</i>

19:32.213 --> 19:34.132
<i>You felt the sting of
every setback</i>

19:34.132 --> 19:36.509
<i>and the heartbreak
of every loss."</i>

19:36.509 --> 19:38.845
"And if the season ended
short of victory,

19:38.845 --> 19:41.389
as it did so many times,

19:41.389 --> 19:45.352
Carlos Garza reminded you
that hope springs eternal

19:45.352 --> 19:48.521
and better days
are always just ahead."

19:51.232 --> 19:53.193
Wow.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.569
But would it have
killed you to say

19:54.569 --> 19:55.862
where he got
his favorite pasteles?

19:58.281 --> 20:00.700
You know, I was thinking about
what you had asked--

20:00.700 --> 20:03.703
if this is the life
that I want to live.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.996
And, honestly, I don't know.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.874
But I know that my game
is not over yet.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.043
Even if I share
a small apartment

20:10.043 --> 20:11.878
and my job surrounds me
with dead people,

20:11.878 --> 20:13.922
I weirdly think that
this is good for me.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.716
And I know
you're disappointed in me.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.177
I'm not disappointed, Nell.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.763
I'm proud of you, just like
I've always been proud of you.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.807
And of course
you gotta go for it.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.017
I did, and I got my dream
to come true.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.143
What's that?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.812
Serving pasteles
to Carlos Garza?

20:29.854 --> 20:31.481
No, <i>mija.</i>

20:31.481 --> 20:32.899
I got to be your dad.

20:36.528 --> 20:39.698
Mm! Mwah!

20:42.450 --> 20:43.576
<i>Dennis.</i>

20:47.997 --> 20:49.165
Hello?

20:49.165 --> 20:51.251
<i>Dennis, I'd like to have
a word with you.</i>

20:52.752 --> 20:54.879
Um, yes, Mr. Rhodes?

20:54.879 --> 20:58.174
<i>While what you said to me
earlier was extremely awkward,</i>

20:58.174 --> 21:01.302
<i>I just want you to know
I love you, too.</i>

21:02.429 --> 21:04.597
Mr. Rhodes.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.058
I-I don't know what to say.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.728
<i>Say nothing to no one.</i>

21:09.728 --> 21:11.604
I will carry this secret
to my grave.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.817
Oh, for...

21:15.817 --> 21:17.694
You were supposed
to tell him the truth.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.779
Come on!
This is so much more fun.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.823
- Lexi!
- I'm calling Nell.

21:21.823 --> 21:22.866
No, you are not!

21:22.866 --> 21:24.034
- Come on!
- No!
