Maya Travis.

00:27.493 --> 00:28.960
Already?

00:29.136 --> 00:30.470
It's been eight long months,

00:30.504 --> 00:32.438
and the trial that's divided the country

00:32.473 --> 00:34.440
- is nearly over.
- They're back.

00:34.475 --> 00:36.709
Mega movie star Severen "Sevvy" Johnson

00:36.743 --> 00:40.079
stands accused of stabbing
his ex-wife, Cassandra Johnson,

00:40.113 --> 00:43.449
and her friend Nancy Weeks
to death nearly a year ago.

00:43.484 --> 00:46.085
The London-born actor
took Hollywood by storm

00:46.119 --> 00:48.454
and became a fixture in American cinema

00:48.489 --> 00:51.324
until the brutal murders
that shook Los Angeles.

00:51.358 --> 00:52.458
Although famed attorney Ezra Wolf

00:52.493 --> 00:55.461
tried to sway the jury
with an aggressive defense

00:55.496 --> 00:56.629
that painted Johnson as a victim

00:56.663 --> 00:59.131
of racism and police misconduct,

00:59.166 --> 01:01.667
fiery prosecutor Maya Travis fought back

01:01.702 --> 01:03.669
with powerful evidence
of Johnson's guilt.

01:03.704 --> 01:05.805
We all know what verdict to expect today.

01:42.309 --> 01:43.476
Maya!

01:43.510 --> 01:45.611
You bitch!

01:45.646 --> 01:46.846
Go get 'em, Maya! Go get 'em!

01:51.251 --> 01:52.685
Calm down!

02:01.595 --> 02:05.865
Superior Court of
California, County of Los Angeles.

02:05.899 --> 02:08.734
In the matter of the people
of the State of California

02:08.769 --> 02:11.037
versus Severen Johnson,

02:11.071 --> 02:15.517
case number B37-96.

02:16.743 --> 02:20.413
We the jury in the above entitled action

02:20.447 --> 02:23.983
find the defendant, Severen Johnson...

02:26.887 --> 02:28.254
...not guilty.

02:28.288 --> 02:29.655
No!

02:34.194 --> 02:36.028
We did it, man.

02:37.764 --> 02:39.398
No, you did it.

02:53.914 --> 02:56.115
I told you I was innocent.

03:32.786 --> 03:34.763
You did everything you could, Maya.

03:35.622 --> 03:37.557
I wish that mattered.

03:56.943 --> 03:59.679
_

04:15.328 --> 04:17.630
Hey. He lost a shoe.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.801
Thanks. Have you seen Riv?

04:21.834 --> 04:23.102
Yeah. In the barn.

04:26.073 --> 04:27.440
She took a bottle.

04:30.243 --> 04:32.011
Mm.

04:32.045 --> 04:34.547
Can I get you a BLT, no mayo?

04:34.581 --> 04:36.682
I don't want to leave her yet.

04:36.717 --> 04:38.150
It's a good thing I deliver.

04:41.154 --> 04:43.289
Shh.

04:52.599 --> 04:53.833
Matthew.

04:56.536 --> 04:57.937
What are you doing here?

04:59.840 --> 05:01.340
He did it again.

05:01.374 --> 05:04.009
You have to come back, Maya.

05:04.044 --> 05:06.345
This time, we're gonna get him.

05:18.225 --> 05:19.725
The body of Jessica Meyer,

05:19.760 --> 05:22.361
the 26-year-old girlfriend
of Sevvy Johnson,

05:22.395 --> 05:23.863
was found five days ago

05:23.897 --> 05:26.499
in a secluded area of Malibu Bluffs Park,

05:26.533 --> 05:27.767
bludgeoned to death.

05:27.801 --> 05:30.069
Mr. Johnson is not a person of interest

05:30.103 --> 05:31.704
at this time.

05:31.738 --> 05:32.838
There are multiple leads,

05:32.873 --> 05:33.986
and police are pursuing them all.

05:34.021 --> 05:35.407
Oh, come on. Go for the spread. Go.

05:35.442 --> 05:36.842
Go!

05:36.877 --> 05:38.878
We're live now
at Hollywood Forever Cemetery,

05:38.912 --> 05:41.881
where Jessica Meyer's funeral
is about to begin.

05:42.949 --> 05:44.850
Isn't that Sevvy Johnson?

05:48.421 --> 05:49.789
Damn it.

06:10.811 --> 06:12.244
I wasn't sure you'd show.

06:12.279 --> 06:13.879
Me neither.

06:24.024 --> 06:27.059
You, uh, packed light.

06:27.093 --> 06:28.727
I'm only gonna be here a couple days.

06:30.363 --> 06:32.298
Whatever I can get from you, I'll take.

06:39.339 --> 06:41.974
I still see them in my dreams.

06:42.008 --> 06:43.909
Cassandra and Nancy.

06:45.312 --> 06:46.454
Me too.

06:49.149 --> 06:51.116
I-I'll go through my files from the case

06:51.151 --> 06:53.919
and see if there's anything
relevant to this new murder,

06:53.954 --> 06:55.207
anything that might help

06:55.241 --> 06:57.423
connect Johnson to Jessica's death.

06:59.192 --> 07:03.295
Beyond that, I-I can't do this
with you, Matthew.

07:05.332 --> 07:09.335
It took a long time,
but I'm finally happy.

07:11.238 --> 07:13.205
I just appreciate that you came.

07:33.393 --> 07:34.827
Everybody's eyeballing me.

07:34.861 --> 07:37.162
Come on, Dad. What did you expect?

07:37.197 --> 07:38.964
Don't worry about it, Dad.

07:49.910 --> 07:51.043
Been back at all?

07:51.077 --> 07:52.104
No.

08:28.949 --> 08:30.716
My condolences, John.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.885
I'll stand with you.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.102
I loved her, too.

08:35.822 --> 08:37.121
I'm not gonna make a scene,

08:37.157 --> 08:39.091
but I'm also not gonna
stand here and pretend

08:39.125 --> 08:40.759
that you didn't kill my daughter.

08:40.794 --> 08:42.895
Don't... Don't say that.

08:42.929 --> 08:44.697
You can't accuse me. I loved...

08:44.731 --> 08:46.265
Hey.

08:46.299 --> 08:47.466
Don't make this worse.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.035
I loved Jessica.

08:50.070 --> 08:51.103
What the hell are you doing here?

08:51.137 --> 08:52.171
Keeping you out of trouble.

08:52.205 --> 08:53.238
Look, you're not my babysitter,

08:53.273 --> 08:54.440
and I don't need a lawyer.

08:54.474 --> 08:55.641
I am not here as your lawyer.

08:55.675 --> 08:57.242
I am here as an old friend.

08:57.277 --> 08:58.577
You don't have friends.

08:58.611 --> 09:00.612
And I didn't do anything.

09:00.647 --> 09:02.948
So, you being here
is making me look guilty.

09:02.983 --> 09:04.783
You making a scene makes you look guilty.

09:06.586 --> 09:08.587
Here's some friendly lawyer advice.

09:08.621 --> 09:09.646
Go home.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.923
Keep your head down.

09:10.957 --> 09:13.292
And don't talk to the police.

09:13.326 --> 09:15.961
Wolf, I just buried someone I loved.

09:16.863 --> 09:18.998
So, how about you go home

09:19.032 --> 09:20.466
and I'll take care of myself?

09:25.805 --> 09:28.774
He killed them.
The evidence was undeniable.

09:28.808 --> 09:31.010
It wasn't about the evidence.

09:31.044 --> 09:34.179
Wolf capitalized on
400 years of racial injustice

09:34.214 --> 09:35.371
and a celebrity client

09:35.406 --> 09:37.458
who knew how to break out
a mega-watt smile.

09:38.551 --> 09:39.745
Listen, while you're here,

09:39.780 --> 09:42.087
maybe you could sit down
with Loni Kampoor,

09:42.122 --> 09:44.257
the lead attorney on Jessica's murder.

09:45.058 --> 09:48.961
If this trip down memory lane
sparks anything useful,

09:48.995 --> 09:50.035
I'll talk to you.

09:50.070 --> 09:51.430
But there is no way in hell

09:51.464 --> 09:53.165
I'm going back into the D.A.'s office.

09:53.199 --> 09:54.867
If I'm gonna build a case,

09:54.901 --> 09:57.002
I need a search warrant
for Johnson's house and car,

09:57.037 --> 09:58.837
and for that, I need probable cause.

09:58.872 --> 10:01.040
I've been in the country, not in a coma.

10:01.074 --> 10:03.142
I'm still a lawyer.

10:04.177 --> 10:05.778
I know the rules.

10:07.514 --> 10:09.014
It's good to see you.

10:16.890 --> 10:18.457
You got married.

10:20.226 --> 10:21.419
Yeah.

10:21.928 --> 10:23.195
To Effy.

10:23.229 --> 10:24.229
The reporter?

10:24.264 --> 10:25.715
Yeah.

10:27.734 --> 10:29.701
Effy was there for me after the trial.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.974
And you married a cowboy.

10:37.243 --> 10:38.377
We're not married.

10:45.518 --> 10:47.386
Johnson has been keeping a low profile

10:47.420 --> 10:49.254
since his surprise acquittal

10:49.289 --> 10:51.590
in the stabbing death
of his wife, Cassandra Johnson,

10:51.624 --> 10:52.925
eight years ago.

10:52.959 --> 10:55.594
Though some still believe
he was innocent,

10:55.628 --> 10:56.862
the one-time A-lister

10:56.896 --> 10:59.531
never regained his superstar status.

10:59.566 --> 11:02.067
Overseas endorsements
are his primary source of...

11:02.102 --> 11:03.902
Former prosecutor Maya Travis

11:03.937 --> 11:05.493
could not be reached for comment.

11:05.528 --> 11:08.040
Johnson has so far
refused to talk to police.

11:08.074 --> 11:09.425
Dad.

11:10.477 --> 11:12.377
Geez.

11:12.412 --> 11:13.503
Hey, babe.

11:13.538 --> 11:15.180
What are you doing up, hmm?

11:16.316 --> 11:17.916
Come to Daddy.

11:17.951 --> 11:19.644
Let's go get you some milk, huh?

11:22.288 --> 11:24.729
Don't believe
what they say on telly, huh?

11:25.792 --> 11:28.227
It's just people talking.

11:28.261 --> 11:29.862
I know, Daddy.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.267
Good girl.

11:36.736 --> 11:39.238
Are you looking at anybody
besides Johnson?

11:39.272 --> 11:41.039
For one, her personal-training client,

11:41.074 --> 11:42.741
Ben Mitchell... he found the body.

11:42.775 --> 11:44.409
But I have whole teams of investigators

11:44.444 --> 11:45.453
looking into other leads.

11:45.488 --> 11:46.733
You're here for Johnson.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.914
Find me something
that links Jessica's murder

11:48.948 --> 11:51.250
to the ones eight years ago,
a pattern or a...

11:51.284 --> 11:53.552
I don't know what it is,
but find me something.

11:53.586 --> 11:55.420
You mean if there is something.

11:55.455 --> 11:57.598
Yeah. Of course.

11:58.124 --> 12:01.660
Do you really think
he's dumb enough to kill again?

12:05.031 --> 12:06.532
Collier.

12:09.936 --> 12:12.304
Okay. Thanks.

12:12.338 --> 12:15.140
Sevvy Johnson just
walked into the police station.

12:17.210 --> 12:18.911
He wants to talk.

12:18.945 --> 12:21.180
Look, like I said, I'm an open book.

12:21.214 --> 12:24.316
Anything you need to ask me,
that's why I'm here, okay?

12:24.350 --> 12:26.652
- We appreciate that.
- Mr. Johnson...

12:26.686 --> 12:27.853
No, no, no. Please.

12:27.887 --> 12:28.997
Call me Sevvy.

12:29.032 --> 12:30.812
We're working together here, all right?

12:30.846 --> 12:32.858
You said that Jessica had
early-morning clients

12:32.892 --> 12:33.926
at the park.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.327
Yeah. She's a trainer.

12:36.362 --> 12:38.806
Well, she was a trainer.

12:39.365 --> 12:40.799
Feels just like a movie, you know?

12:40.833 --> 12:42.334
It's just so unreal.

12:42.368 --> 12:45.137
You guys watch "Omega,"
the one I was nominated for?

12:45.171 --> 12:46.338
I mean, it's just like that.

12:46.372 --> 12:48.607
I love that one.

12:48.641 --> 12:51.543
Yeah. What time did Jessica
leave that morning?

12:51.578 --> 12:54.813
I like this guy. He's,
uh, all about business, huh?

12:54.847 --> 12:55.984
You're like me, you know.

12:56.018 --> 12:58.383
Well, we all just...

12:58.418 --> 12:59.551
We want to solve Jessica's murder.

12:59.586 --> 13:00.953
Well, look, that's why I'm here...

13:00.987 --> 13:02.287
without counsel, right?

13:02.322 --> 13:03.655
I came in to help you guys out

13:03.690 --> 13:05.023
so you don't waste time on me

13:05.058 --> 13:06.358
while Jess' killer's still out there.

13:06.392 --> 13:07.559
How'd you guys meet?

13:07.594 --> 13:09.394
You didn't read about it?

13:09.429 --> 13:12.590
Tabloids had a field day with that.

13:13.199 --> 13:15.300
Uh, my daughter... Star?

13:15.335 --> 13:17.369
Well...

13:17.403 --> 13:18.763
Jess was her roommate.

13:20.039 --> 13:22.374
You hooked up with
your daughter's roommate?

13:22.408 --> 13:23.471
Yeah.

13:23.505 --> 13:25.377
Star hasn't forgiven me for that one.

13:25.411 --> 13:29.748
Um, let's talk about
the last time you saw Jessica.

13:29.782 --> 13:32.918
Yeah. Uh, I was out with my son Gabe.

13:32.952 --> 13:34.176
Cassandra's son.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.388
Well, he was four when I met Cassandra.

13:36.422 --> 13:38.190
There wasn't a father in the picture,

13:38.224 --> 13:40.259
so as far as I'm concerned,
Gabe's my kid.

13:40.293 --> 13:42.912
He didn't blame you
for what happened to his mom?

13:44.622 --> 13:46.732
Nah. He knew I didn't do it.

13:46.766 --> 13:48.367
Just like the jury.

13:48.401 --> 13:49.434
So, what'd you do?

13:49.469 --> 13:52.797
You know, usual kid stuff,
bit of this, bit of that.

13:53.306 --> 13:55.841
Got some food down, uh, on Fairfax. Yeah.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.109
They're playing it wrong.

13:57.143 --> 13:58.277
They're trying to pin him to a timeline.

13:58.311 --> 13:59.711
You think he doesn't know that?

13:59.746 --> 14:01.179
It's not gonna work.

14:02.949 --> 14:05.250
I need a piece of paper.

14:08.721 --> 14:10.956
I didn't look at my watch, but...

14:10.990 --> 14:12.724
This ought to shake things up.

14:12.759 --> 14:15.060
Give this to the tall one.

14:17.096 --> 14:19.064
They need to get him off balance.

14:20.767 --> 14:21.993
Sir.

14:27.974 --> 14:30.375
Uh, moo shu pork for me.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.644
Uh, kung pao, please.

14:32.679 --> 14:33.945
Sorry about that.

14:33.980 --> 14:38.150
So, Jessica was in bed when you got home.

14:38.184 --> 14:40.085
Yeah. Sound asleep.

14:40.119 --> 14:41.318
So, you didn't get into a fight?

14:41.352 --> 14:42.312
No.

14:42.346 --> 14:44.156
When was the first time you hit Jessica?

14:44.190 --> 14:45.190
I didn't hit her, man.

14:45.224 --> 14:47.492
Listen, I came in here
to help you guys out...

14:47.527 --> 14:49.394
We just want to help you.
You know, if there's anything

14:49.429 --> 14:50.722
that's gonna come out later on,

14:50.756 --> 14:52.664
make you look bad,
it's just better if we know now.

14:52.699 --> 14:54.499
She get tired of the beatings,
tell you she was leaving, what?

14:54.534 --> 14:55.667
Listen, you got a hearing problem?

14:55.702 --> 14:56.968
I told you I didn't hit her.

14:57.003 --> 14:58.603
I gotta warn you, man, the lies...

14:58.638 --> 15:00.405
they're gonna come back
and bite you in the ass.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.606
Listen, where's all this coming from?

15:01.641 --> 15:02.908
I came in here of my own volition.

15:02.942 --> 15:04.309
Or was she cheating on you?

15:04.344 --> 15:05.477
You know, that was it.

15:05.511 --> 15:07.612
You couldn't keep up with
such a young, hot piece of ass.

15:07.647 --> 15:09.181
I mean, you're not as young
as you used to be.

15:09.215 --> 15:10.515
Piss off.

15:18.391 --> 15:20.625
No. Damn it.

15:21.994 --> 15:23.554
Hey, I asked you a question.

15:25.031 --> 15:26.631
Hey, I asked you a question!

15:38.311 --> 15:41.113
Are you back there, Maya?

15:48.921 --> 15:51.832
You're never gonna get me, Maya.

15:53.259 --> 15:55.026
I'm an innocent man.

16:08.658 --> 16:10.659
You cheated and you lied

16:20.052 --> 16:21.419
Thanks for coming.

16:21.453 --> 16:22.520
He's been waiting.

16:25.090 --> 16:26.457
You are a moron.

16:26.491 --> 16:28.626
I wanted the cops
to know that I didn't do it.

16:28.660 --> 16:31.529
You never learn... ever.

16:31.563 --> 16:32.864
My girlfriend is dead.

16:32.898 --> 16:34.732
So, I don't give a damn
about your stupid rules.

16:34.766 --> 16:36.801
Oh. So you don't need me?

16:36.835 --> 16:38.669
Great! Good luck!

16:41.139 --> 16:42.299
Wait.

16:45.644 --> 16:46.944
I need you.

16:47.638 --> 16:48.913
The bitch is back.

16:50.082 --> 16:51.449
Yeah.

16:51.483 --> 16:52.817
She was at the station.

16:52.851 --> 16:55.396
I could feel her.

16:58.257 --> 17:00.591
So, they're not screwing around.

17:00.626 --> 17:02.326
Look, I'm innocent.

17:02.361 --> 17:04.127
Well, you were innocent eight years ago.

17:04.162 --> 17:05.463
But you spent over a year in jail.

17:05.497 --> 17:07.565
You paid me millions to get you off.

17:07.598 --> 17:08.633
No complaints from me,

17:08.666 --> 17:10.134
but do you really want
to go through that again?

17:10.167 --> 17:12.603
- What do I do?
- You follow my stupid rules.

17:12.637 --> 17:14.305
You lay low. No more interviews...

17:14.339 --> 17:17.174
not with reporters and
definitely not with detectives.

17:17.209 --> 17:20.111
Anytime you go out in public,
I control the optics.

17:20.145 --> 17:21.178
Okay.

17:21.213 --> 17:22.305
And Maya Travis?

17:22.339 --> 17:23.981
You let me worry about her.

17:24.016 --> 17:26.684
She's tough, but she fights fair.

17:26.718 --> 17:28.019
That's always been her weakness.

17:28.053 --> 17:30.288
I can't go back to jail.

17:30.322 --> 17:33.100
You won't. You did the right thing.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.127
You got the Wolf.

17:43.902 --> 17:47.038
Now, don't let her looks fool you.

17:47.072 --> 17:48.606
Jess shreds on these machines.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.207
Check this out.

17:50.242 --> 17:52.009
- I'm pretty hard-core.
- Mm-hmm.

17:53.078 --> 17:56.047
But he's the real shredder.
I just try to keep up.

17:56.081 --> 18:00.051
Now, we stay active, as you can see.

18:00.085 --> 18:02.420
We eat healthy. And...

18:04.156 --> 18:06.223
All right, Matthew,

18:06.258 --> 18:07.431
I'm coming in.

18:12.097 --> 18:13.130
Welcome back.

18:13.165 --> 18:14.934
I'm not back.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.335
Seriously?

18:17.369 --> 18:18.936
Alan Wiest is the D.A.?

18:20.172 --> 18:22.907
Mediocrity always rises to the top.

18:22.941 --> 18:25.076
What did he think about
you bringing me in?

18:25.110 --> 18:28.155
Wiest does prayer breakfasts
and press conferences.

18:28.914 --> 18:31.575
I'm the chief deputy. It's my call.

18:34.186 --> 18:35.486
Loni is lead on this case,

18:35.520 --> 18:37.188
but I want to make this clear...

18:37.222 --> 18:38.823
all leads will be followed,

18:38.857 --> 18:41.258
not just Sevvy Johnson... all leads.

18:41.293 --> 18:43.361
Sure. But off the record?

18:43.395 --> 18:45.229
We all know he's our guy.

18:45.263 --> 18:47.665
Johnson only lets women
leave him in a pine box.

18:47.699 --> 18:49.166
Unfortunately, this time he didn't leave

18:49.201 --> 18:50.267
a trail of blood for us to follow.

18:50.302 --> 18:52.770
Johnson's had eight years
to think about his mistakes.

18:52.804 --> 18:54.211
He won't make the same ones again.

18:54.246 --> 18:56.040
Well, hopefully
he's gonna make some new ones.

18:56.074 --> 18:57.810
If it's him.

18:58.210 --> 19:00.244
I love this new look,
by the way, the whole thing.

19:00.278 --> 19:02.380
Priority one is a search warrant.

19:02.414 --> 19:03.881
Bludgeoning is bloody.

19:03.915 --> 19:05.516
If he did it, there'll be traces of blood

19:05.550 --> 19:07.084
in his car, in his house.

19:07.119 --> 19:09.120
To that end, we've got
detectives door-knocking,

19:09.154 --> 19:11.522
checking surveillance tapes,
talking to friends,

19:11.556 --> 19:12.723
and we're waiting on forensics.

19:12.758 --> 19:14.091
Our problem is motive.

19:14.126 --> 19:15.626
With Cassandra, everyone knew

19:15.660 --> 19:17.228
their relationship was a disaster.

19:17.262 --> 19:19.630
But Johnson and Jessica
were all sunshine and roses.

19:19.664 --> 19:21.565
Did you see the "Inside Hollywood" tape?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.300
Yeah.

19:23.335 --> 19:25.302
Between the giggling
and the googlie eyes,

19:25.337 --> 19:26.404
it was defense gold.

19:26.438 --> 19:27.538
Let's watch it again.

19:31.476 --> 19:32.963
Jess shreds on these machines.

19:32.998 --> 19:34.183
I'll tell you. Check this out.

19:34.217 --> 19:35.212
I'm pretty hard-core.

19:35.247 --> 19:36.321
Sorry I'm late.

19:36.356 --> 19:38.949
I was checking out Ben Mitchell's story.

19:38.984 --> 19:41.318
The training client who found the body.

19:41.353 --> 19:42.586
According to Mitchell, their relationship

19:42.621 --> 19:43.988
was strictly professional.

19:44.022 --> 19:46.290
I haven't heard otherwise,
but I'll keep digging.

19:46.324 --> 19:48.192
Hey, CJ. How you doing?

19:49.761 --> 19:51.796
Like I said, defense gold.

19:51.830 --> 19:53.330
Not exactly.

19:53.365 --> 19:55.966
Let's start with the googlie eyes.

19:57.169 --> 19:58.469
Now, don't let her looks fool...

19:58.503 --> 20:01.238
She's looking at him
for permission to speak.

20:01.273 --> 20:03.007
- ...on these machines.
- Then she's seeing if

20:03.041 --> 20:04.775
what she said meets his approval.

20:06.278 --> 20:07.978
You see that look he gives her?

20:08.013 --> 20:09.513
He doesn't approve.

20:09.548 --> 20:11.282
She makes a mean green juice,

20:11.316 --> 20:12.616
don't you, darling?

20:12.651 --> 20:15.453
That laughter... it's a fear response.

20:15.487 --> 20:17.321
Consciously or unconsciously,

20:17.355 --> 20:19.990
she is trying to avoid conflict.

20:20.025 --> 20:22.359
What do you notice about his bedroom?

20:22.394 --> 20:24.095
It's masculine.

20:24.129 --> 20:27.131
And she's lived there
for how long at this point?

20:27.165 --> 20:28.165
Eight months?

20:28.200 --> 20:30.701
Where's her stuff?
He didn't let her bring it.

20:30.735 --> 20:33.370
She's like a decoration in his house.

20:33.405 --> 20:36.273
Jessica was a smart, motivated woman.

20:36.308 --> 20:40.311
She aced UCSB, volunteered,
and she had lots of friends.

20:40.345 --> 20:42.279
And then she met Sevvy,

20:42.314 --> 20:44.482
and history began to repeat itself.

20:44.516 --> 20:46.217
At first, he charmed her,

20:46.251 --> 20:50.045
and then slowly but surely,
he started to control her.

20:50.079 --> 20:51.789
My guess?

20:51.823 --> 20:54.927
She pushed back, and it all went to hell.

20:56.261 --> 20:57.561
And then he killed her.

21:02.534 --> 21:05.069
Admit it. That felt good.

21:05.103 --> 21:06.370
Not even a little bit.

21:07.577 --> 21:09.173
The detective sitting on Johnson's house

21:09.207 --> 21:11.208
says Ezra Wolf was there this morning.

21:11.243 --> 21:13.410
So he's scared. He's done talking.

21:13.445 --> 21:15.079
Wolf will lock him down.

21:15.113 --> 21:16.247
I need you here, Maya.

21:16.281 --> 21:18.784
Loni's not gonna see the Wolfman coming.

21:19.417 --> 21:22.186
He plays a special kind of dirty.

21:22.220 --> 21:24.123
Just give me a few weeks.

21:25.123 --> 21:26.524
Please?

21:26.558 --> 21:27.992
I'll think about it.

21:28.026 --> 21:29.226
Thank you, everyone, for canceling

21:29.261 --> 21:32.363
whatever plans you might have
had for the next six months.

21:32.397 --> 21:33.864
You are all here to help me

21:33.899 --> 21:36.100
keep an innocent man out of jail.

21:36.134 --> 21:39.170
As long as Sevvy Johnson
is under a cloud of suspicion...

21:39.204 --> 21:42.239
and the fact that Maya Travis is back

21:42.274 --> 21:44.408
means we are in
for one hell of a storm...

21:44.442 --> 21:47.411
your asses are mine 24/7.

21:47.445 --> 21:48.546
I don't care if your mother has a stroke,

21:48.580 --> 21:50.080
your kid has a birthday party.

21:50.115 --> 21:52.943
You don't like it, I invite you to leave.

21:56.588 --> 21:57.823
Good.

21:58.290 --> 21:59.757
Now, this case has already been tried

21:59.791 --> 22:01.625
in the court of public opinion,

22:01.660 --> 22:04.628
a court that has gotten bigger
over the past decade.

22:04.663 --> 22:07.064
Now we have idiots
on Twitter and Instagram

22:07.098 --> 22:09.400
and Snapchat and Facebook
and whatever else

22:09.434 --> 22:10.768
spouting off.

22:10.802 --> 22:13.537
Those idiots could be for us,

22:13.572 --> 22:15.906
or they could be against us.

22:15.941 --> 22:18.943
We are girding for battle.

22:18.977 --> 22:20.929
And we are doing it now.

22:22.447 --> 22:26.617
Which is why you're all
gonna bow down to this man...

22:26.651 --> 22:28.419
Mr. Ares Ahn,

22:28.453 --> 22:32.256
our media consultant, our guru, our god.

22:32.290 --> 22:33.724
Greetings from New York.

22:33.758 --> 22:38.262
Ares, let the Age of Enlightenment begin.

22:38.296 --> 22:40.431
Every time you all step foot
outside of this office,

22:40.465 --> 22:41.999
you are representing your client.

22:42.033 --> 22:43.500
If the public doesn't trust you,

22:43.535 --> 22:45.769
they won't trust him.
If they don't like you,

22:45.804 --> 22:47.438
they won't like him.

22:47.472 --> 22:50.407
Getting the potential jury pool
on Johnson's side once?

22:50.442 --> 22:51.475
A miracle.

22:51.509 --> 22:52.910
Twice?

22:52.944 --> 22:54.178
Statistically impossible.

22:54.212 --> 22:55.980
And that is why you're here.

22:56.014 --> 22:58.816
Okay, then. Let's talk Q Quotient.

22:58.850 --> 23:01.018
We are going to make America

23:01.052 --> 23:02.971
fall back in love with Sevvy Johnson.

23:09.060 --> 23:10.427
Hey, CJ.

23:10.462 --> 23:11.595
Still in the dungeon?

23:11.630 --> 23:12.696
It's quiet.

23:12.731 --> 23:13.964
I like quiet.

23:16.501 --> 23:17.641
What are you working on?

23:17.675 --> 23:19.370
I'm checking pings
from Jessica's cellphone

23:19.404 --> 23:21.281
three days leading up to the murder.

23:21.906 --> 23:23.707
So far, nothing.

23:23.742 --> 23:26.277
Is there anything I can help you with?

23:26.311 --> 23:27.496
Nope.

23:28.513 --> 23:30.781
I thought about what you said
about Jessica's stuff.

23:30.815 --> 23:34.385
I checked to see if she had
a storage unit, but no luck.

23:34.419 --> 23:36.954
Look, I can tell
that you're pissed at me.

23:36.988 --> 23:38.590
Do you wanna talk about it?

23:40.225 --> 23:42.660
You know how I found out you left L.A.?

23:42.694 --> 23:43.832
I went by your house

23:43.866 --> 23:45.829
and found three weeks' worth
of newspapers

23:45.864 --> 23:47.464
stacked up outside.

23:50.068 --> 23:51.568
We were supposed to be ride or die, Maya.

23:51.603 --> 23:53.337
I didn't even know where you'd gone.

23:53.371 --> 23:54.405
You're right.

23:54.439 --> 23:57.141
I should have told you.
I was in a thousand pieces.

23:57.175 --> 23:58.475
You know what? We all were.

23:58.510 --> 24:00.411
It was tough on all of us.

24:00.445 --> 24:01.712
I'm sorry.

24:13.258 --> 24:15.292
Did Sevvy take Jessica to Bora Bora?

24:17.195 --> 24:19.163
Not as far as I know of. Why?

24:19.197 --> 24:21.932
That's his makeup gift
for the first big beating.

24:33.111 --> 24:34.438
You.

24:34.913 --> 24:36.213
Mr. Meyer.

24:36.247 --> 24:37.915
Are you here 'cause of my daughter?

24:37.949 --> 24:40.117
I am so sorry for your loss.

24:40.151 --> 24:41.085
He killed her, didn't he?

24:41.119 --> 24:43.954
We don't know that.
It's too soon to tell.

24:43.988 --> 24:46.757
You know he did, or you wouldn't be here.

24:48.093 --> 24:50.961
I-I tried to keep her away from him.

24:50.995 --> 24:52.596
- Maya Travis?
- I didn't try hard enough.

24:52.630 --> 24:53.750
I didn't protect her.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.632
Why don't we go somewhere and talk, okay?

24:55.667 --> 24:57.701
But I'm gonna protect her now.

24:57.736 --> 25:00.070
I don't want you
anywhere near Jessica's case!

25:00.105 --> 25:01.638
You lost.

25:01.673 --> 25:03.273
If you'd done your job right,

25:03.308 --> 25:05.642
that bastard would be in jail right now.

25:05.677 --> 25:08.545
And my baby would be alive!

25:09.930 --> 25:11.172
Can we get a quote, Mr. Meyer?

25:16.583 --> 25:18.784
Former prosecutor Maya Travis was spotted

25:18.819 --> 25:21.187
outside of the Los Angeles
D.A.'s office today,

25:21.221 --> 25:22.588
where she was confronted by

25:22.622 --> 25:25.257
murder victim Jessica Meyer's father.

25:25.292 --> 25:27.126
If you'd done your job right,

25:27.160 --> 25:29.228
that bastard would be in jail right now.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.132
- And my baby...
- Thanks, honey.

25:33.166 --> 25:35.134
...would be alive!

25:35.168 --> 25:36.769
She's on every station.

25:38.004 --> 25:40.706
This is not gonna help me
convince her to stay.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.875
You'll think of something.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.043
I don't know. Maya's pretty set

25:44.077 --> 25:45.978
on getting back to her old life.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.165
Who can blame her?

25:47.199 --> 25:48.381
We need her.

25:50.784 --> 25:52.384
She's been through a lot.

25:52.419 --> 25:53.986
So have you.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.622
But you stayed when she ran.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.457
You stayed and worked your ass off

25:58.491 --> 26:00.315
to get to where you are.

26:01.261 --> 26:03.996
You can't be the fall guy
if this thing goes south.

26:22.449 --> 26:24.631
Hey, Riv. It's me.

26:25.485 --> 26:27.509
I just want to hear your voice.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.455
I miss you.

26:34.194 --> 26:35.694
We need to take control of the narrative.

26:35.729 --> 26:37.363
I want every news station there...

26:37.397 --> 26:39.730
cable, network, everybody.

26:40.287 --> 26:43.102
Right. The beauty
of the 24-hour news cycle.

26:46.039 --> 26:47.206
I'll call you later.

26:50.844 --> 26:51.944
Tuan.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.279
Your guys didn't make the spread.

26:53.313 --> 26:54.647
No. I know. I know.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.215
But I'm gonna pay you soon, Tuan.

26:56.249 --> 26:57.549
We're not buying that anymore.

26:57.584 --> 26:59.852
Well, then, you're not watching the news.

26:59.886 --> 27:02.855
My cash cow just came home to graze.

27:02.889 --> 27:05.324
So, you can tell your bosses
that, as of this morning,

27:05.358 --> 27:08.060
all my debts will be paid in full...

27:08.094 --> 27:09.128
and then some.

27:09.162 --> 27:11.030
It's not up to me.

27:12.766 --> 27:14.800
Next time, it'll be the face.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.739
- There she is!
- Damn it.

27:20.774 --> 27:22.174
We need a good shot!

27:22.208 --> 27:23.309
That's her, that's her, that's her!

27:26.546 --> 27:28.714
Maya, can we get a comment?
Can we get a comment?

27:28.748 --> 27:30.649
- Maya!
- Come on, Maya!

27:30.684 --> 27:32.251
- Any comment, Maya?
- Give us a statement!

27:32.285 --> 27:34.219
Do you believe that Sevvy killed her?

27:34.254 --> 27:36.021
- Can you get him this time?
- Maya, give us a statement, please!

27:43.619 --> 27:44.753
Yeah?

27:45.699 --> 27:46.932
Fundraiser?

27:46.967 --> 27:49.735
Charity dinner. Mayor's house.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.503
Any movement on the case?

27:51.538 --> 27:54.273
Well, Detective Ramon just
dropped this on my desk...

27:54.307 --> 27:58.010
Jessica with Ben Mitchell,
looking quite cozy together.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.279
It was taken two weeks ago
at Beacher's Madhouse.

28:00.313 --> 28:02.281
Mitchell deleted the post
from his Instagram

28:02.315 --> 28:03.515
the same day Jessica was murdered.

28:03.550 --> 28:06.752
So, when Mitchell said their
relationship was all business,

28:06.786 --> 28:07.946
he was lying.

28:07.981 --> 28:10.055
But other than this, his story holds up.

28:10.090 --> 28:11.623
And he's got a clean record.

28:11.658 --> 28:13.292
Dig into this.

28:13.326 --> 28:14.860
The press is gonna hand me my ass

28:14.894 --> 28:17.363
if it looks like we're just
targeting Sevvy Johnson.

28:17.397 --> 28:20.132
And make sure Maya and Matthew
see that picture.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.623
I'll show Matthew.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.302
Maya's not part of this case.

28:23.336 --> 28:24.370
Did you know Maya used to be

28:24.404 --> 28:27.129
the head of the office
birthday party committee?

28:27.907 --> 28:29.208
That's hard to picture.

28:29.242 --> 28:32.077
Before Johnson, she was actually fun.

28:32.112 --> 28:34.113
I was here when that trial went down.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.248
I saw what they did to her.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.283
Being lead was no prize.

28:39.519 --> 28:41.320
Because she lost.

28:41.354 --> 28:42.554
I plan to win.

28:48.361 --> 28:49.561
How'd you guys meet?

28:49.596 --> 28:50.896
You didn't read about it?

28:50.930 --> 28:54.299
Tabloids had a field day with that one.

28:54.334 --> 28:56.335
Uh, my daughter... Star?

28:56.369 --> 28:58.103
Well...

28:58.138 --> 28:59.828
Jess was her roommate.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.909
Yeah. Star hasn't forgiven me
for that one.

29:43.083 --> 29:44.109
Aah!

29:44.144 --> 29:45.284
Whoa! It's me!

29:45.318 --> 29:46.437
God, Riv!

29:46.471 --> 29:48.620
I almost shot you!
What are you doing here?!

29:48.655 --> 29:50.122
I was just worried about you.

29:51.858 --> 29:52.858
I'm fine.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.716
Yeah. I can see that.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.261
I...

29:57.997 --> 29:59.364
You saw the news.

29:59.399 --> 30:00.514
Yeah. Everyone did.

30:03.436 --> 30:05.435
Was it this bad last time?

30:06.172 --> 30:07.896
It was worse.

30:09.609 --> 30:12.811
It's okay. I'm here.

30:23.423 --> 30:25.664
I know the ocean is there.

30:26.593 --> 30:28.227
But I just can't see it.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.504
Do you remember our first house?

30:32.966 --> 30:34.533
It had a view of a back alley.

30:36.269 --> 30:37.680
I don't know how we survived

30:37.715 --> 30:40.011
bringing up three kids in that house.

30:41.241 --> 30:42.764
We didn't.

30:48.248 --> 30:49.448
And how are you holding up?

30:49.482 --> 30:52.017
Ah, I can't sleep, barely eat.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.586
I-I just can't believe she's gone.

30:54.621 --> 30:57.356
And there's a damn cop car on my house!

30:57.390 --> 30:59.258
A detective came by my place, too.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.926
I didn't answer the door.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.762
He left this.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.041
Just like last time.

31:10.837 --> 31:13.461
They always want to talk to the ex.

31:14.407 --> 31:16.608
I can't go through this again, Jules.

31:16.643 --> 31:19.278
Just tell me what you need, baby.

31:19.312 --> 31:22.147
Wolf... he wants to do
a press conference tomorrow,

31:22.182 --> 31:23.638
the whole family...

31:24.417 --> 31:26.718
- including you.
- Don't I always show up for you?

31:31.491 --> 31:32.724
How much?

31:37.130 --> 31:38.463
$100,000.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.448
For now.

31:44.230 --> 31:46.131
I didn't do it.

31:46.156 --> 31:48.371
I loved Jessica.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.577
I believe you did love her.

31:51.611 --> 31:53.612
Just like you loved Cassandra.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.850
Just like you loved me.

32:22.505 --> 32:25.776
You know, we probably have
seven hours until our flight.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.813
Wanna show me the Hollywood sign?

32:33.620 --> 32:35.668
They asked me to stay.

32:36.556 --> 32:37.823
What'd you say?

32:37.857 --> 32:39.224
That I'd think about it.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.893
But after yesterday,

32:41.928 --> 32:46.346
this isn't my world anymore.

32:46.799 --> 32:48.734
And I don't want it to be.

32:48.768 --> 32:50.369
I was afraid you missed all this.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.940
Nothing to miss.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.748
Reporter.

33:02.782 --> 33:04.249
Don't answer.

33:05.785 --> 33:07.786
I'm gonna answer it.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.536
With my mean face.

33:11.257 --> 33:12.891
Oh! Hi.

33:12.925 --> 33:14.259
What's going on?

33:14.293 --> 33:15.460
You were right.

33:15.495 --> 33:17.763
Jessica did stash her stuff somewhere...

33:17.797 --> 33:19.379
just not under her name.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.925
- That's her.
- Star.

33:25.138 --> 33:26.972
I don't want to talk to you.

33:27.006 --> 33:29.889
Just give me five minutes... for Jessica.

33:30.410 --> 33:31.443
My dad didn't kill her.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.978
Maybe not, but somebody did,

33:33.012 --> 33:34.446
and we're trying to find that person.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.659
I don't know anything about that.

33:35.693 --> 33:37.315
You actually might.

33:37.350 --> 33:39.117
A week before Jessica moved in
with your dad,

33:39.152 --> 33:40.986
you got a storage locker.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.083
Was that for her?

33:42.118 --> 33:43.730
Her credit was shot. She didn't want

33:43.764 --> 33:44.823
to ask my dad for money.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.758
Well, according to GPS records,

33:46.793 --> 33:47.926
she went to that storage locker a lot

33:47.960 --> 33:49.127
in the last couple of months.

33:49.162 --> 33:50.395
Do you know why?

33:53.032 --> 33:55.400
You may not believe this,
but nobody wants

33:55.435 --> 33:58.603
your father to be innocent
of this murder more than me.

33:58.638 --> 34:00.044
Except maybe you.

34:02.875 --> 34:06.050
I bet you're feeling
a little guilty right now.

34:06.479 --> 34:08.246
I didn't do anything wrong.

34:08.281 --> 34:10.014
That's the bitch about guilt.

34:10.049 --> 34:13.308
You don't have to
do anything wrong to feel it.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.853
You introduced Jessica to your dad.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.023
You believed he wasn't a murderer.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.791
You stood by him all these years.

34:19.826 --> 34:21.025
And I get that.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.860
You love him.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.931
But right now you have to be wondering,

34:25.965 --> 34:27.866
did lightning really strike twice?

34:38.244 --> 34:40.083
Where's Star?

34:40.713 --> 34:43.469
- No clue.
- We're here for you, Dad.

34:43.504 --> 34:46.351
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you so much for coming.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.612
Just want to say a few words

34:47.647 --> 34:48.954
on behalf of my client

34:48.987 --> 34:51.989
and my friend, Sevvy Johnson.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.962
No one can know about this.

35:01.934 --> 35:04.970
Eight years ago, the D.A. and the LAPD

35:05.004 --> 35:07.372
tried to frame Sevvy Johnson.

35:07.406 --> 35:08.540
But I beat them.

35:08.574 --> 35:11.009
I exposed the conspiracy.

35:11.043 --> 35:13.912
And now they're looking for payback.

35:13.946 --> 35:16.314
Payback, pure and simple.
That's what this is.

35:16.349 --> 35:18.817
They proved it when
they brought back Maya Travis.

35:18.851 --> 35:20.085
The fix is in!

35:20.119 --> 35:21.253
Matthew should have seen this coming.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.088
The mayor's on the line.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.023
She sounds pissed.

35:25.057 --> 35:28.226
I will not let lying prosecutors

35:28.261 --> 35:29.528
and a corrupt LAPD

35:29.562 --> 35:32.697
try to frame Sevvy Johnson again.

35:32.732 --> 35:34.889
Tell the mayor I'm not here.

35:35.468 --> 35:37.569
My client has fully cooperated,

35:37.603 --> 35:39.905
but they don't want you to know that.

35:39.939 --> 35:42.340
They don't want you to know that
Sevvy Johnson has shown them

35:42.375 --> 35:44.576
he's got nothing to hide.

35:45.778 --> 35:47.112
And the worst part is,

35:47.146 --> 35:50.549
the police know who the killer is.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.185
Ben Mitchell was Jessica's client.

35:53.219 --> 35:56.888
He was found standing over her body.

35:56.923 --> 35:58.390
But are the police targeting him?

35:58.424 --> 36:00.525
No. No, they're not.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.594
And we all know why.

36:02.628 --> 36:06.097
Because Ben Mitchell is a white man!

36:06.132 --> 36:09.568
Sevvy Johnson loved Jessica.

36:12.572 --> 36:16.074
And he never, ever would hurt her.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.244
Never!

36:24.016 --> 36:25.817
He did it again.

36:31.510 --> 36:32.689
He gave me this

36:32.714 --> 36:34.552
when I told him I wasn't ready

36:34.577 --> 36:36.909
to leave Ray's dinner party last night.

36:38.073 --> 36:39.574
The next morning, he told me

36:39.608 --> 36:42.332
he would take me to Bora Bora
to make it up to me.

36:42.911 --> 36:45.084
I said no thanks.

36:50.152 --> 36:51.619
I laughed too hard

36:51.653 --> 36:53.921
when Gabe made fun of Sevvy's
crappy golf swing.

36:53.956 --> 36:55.723
My dad tried to warn me,

36:55.758 --> 36:57.925
and I should've listened.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.894
But I am not gonna wait around
for him to change

36:59.928 --> 37:02.018
and end up like her.

37:02.798 --> 37:05.566
I'm taking these videos to the police.

37:05.601 --> 37:07.635
That's probable cause in my book.

37:07.669 --> 37:09.871
Call a judge. We're getting that
search warrant.

37:15.577 --> 37:17.411
Hey.

37:17.446 --> 37:19.781
Plane's not gonna wait for us.
We got to go.

37:19.815 --> 37:21.037
I...

37:21.750 --> 37:23.289
I can't leave.

37:23.919 --> 37:25.720
Don't do this, Maya.

37:25.754 --> 37:27.421
Just come home with me.

37:27.456 --> 37:28.920
I will...

37:29.658 --> 37:33.383
but not now, not until this is over.

37:34.863 --> 37:37.398
And when this is over

37:37.432 --> 37:39.767
Who will I get back?

37:39.802 --> 37:41.302
I'm afraid if you take this on again,

37:41.336 --> 37:43.838
it's gonna destroy you.

37:43.872 --> 37:45.273
It's not your fight.

37:45.307 --> 37:47.842
I have the chance to get justice,

37:47.876 --> 37:49.610
not just for Jessica,

37:49.645 --> 37:51.913
but for Cassandra and Nancy.

37:51.947 --> 37:53.948
That makes it my fight.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.217
I have to do this, Riv.

37:59.888 --> 38:01.222
Yeah.

38:08.182 --> 38:10.183
Why did you never sell this house?

38:14.002 --> 38:15.169
I didn't want to deal with it.

38:15.204 --> 38:16.270
No.

38:16.305 --> 38:18.261
I don't think that's why.

38:18.807 --> 38:21.008
I think you held onto it

38:21.043 --> 38:23.010
because you're not done here.

38:29.184 --> 38:30.852
So get done.

38:32.588 --> 38:34.155
Then come home to me.

38:40.028 --> 38:42.129
Just be careful.

38:42.164 --> 38:43.364
I will.

38:48.904 --> 38:50.504
If you called me in to let me know

38:50.539 --> 38:52.707
you got the search warrant,
I can save you some time.

38:52.741 --> 38:55.042
I already heard.

38:55.077 --> 38:56.477
Have a seat.

39:02.951 --> 39:04.352
I am lead on this case.

39:04.386 --> 39:06.267
You can't keep
cutting me out of the loop.

39:07.422 --> 39:09.056
Maya's staying.

39:09.091 --> 39:11.522
I'm making her the lead prosecutor.

39:12.261 --> 39:13.361
You're still on the team.

39:13.395 --> 39:14.662
You're just not the lead.

39:14.696 --> 39:16.697
Does Wiest know?

39:16.732 --> 39:18.132
He's fully on board.

39:22.571 --> 39:24.368
Maya's one of the best.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.074
I look forward to working with her.

39:27.109 --> 39:30.044
From this moment on,
all eyes will be on us,

39:30.078 --> 39:32.280
and they will see our every move.

39:32.314 --> 39:34.248
So, good won't be good enough.

39:34.283 --> 39:36.017
We need to be perfect.

39:36.051 --> 39:40.521
No mistakes, no screw-ups,
and for God's sakes, no misses!

39:40.555 --> 39:42.790
Roll in fast and quiet.

39:42.824 --> 39:45.293
Tear the place down to the studs.

39:53.001 --> 39:54.735
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

39:54.770 --> 39:56.203
At home, where you told me to be. Why?

39:56.238 --> 39:57.605
I just heard from my guy on the inside.

39:57.639 --> 39:58.940
They got a search warrant.
They're gonna come

39:58.974 --> 40:00.574
banging on your door any minute.

40:00.609 --> 40:02.376
Now, if there's anything you
don't want them to see...

40:02.411 --> 40:04.078
and I mean anything...
you get rid of it now.

40:11.420 --> 40:12.787
I owe you one.

40:19.261 --> 40:20.461
Gabe!

40:23.665 --> 40:24.999
Hey. Listen.

40:25.033 --> 40:27.068
I've never thought of you
as just a stepson.

40:27.102 --> 40:28.169
You've always been my own son to me.

40:28.203 --> 40:29.236
You know that, right?

40:29.271 --> 40:30.404
Sure. Of course I know that.

40:30.439 --> 40:32.306
And you know I didn't kill Jessica.

40:32.341 --> 40:35.509
But they'll twist things.
They always do. All right?

40:35.544 --> 40:38.245
So I need you to get rid of this.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.047
Now. Go out the back.

40:41.483 --> 40:42.709
Go.

41:18.553 --> 41:20.488
Pull the shades and cover the skylights.

41:20.522 --> 41:22.356
Matthew Collier and Maya Travis

41:22.391 --> 41:24.158
have just arrived at the scene.

41:24.192 --> 41:26.694
Maya Travis left the
D.A.'s office eight years ago,

41:26.728 --> 41:29.497
but it looks like this case
has brought her back.

41:29.531 --> 41:31.298
Johnson's attorney, Ezra Wolf,

41:31.333 --> 41:34.201
has pointed the finger at
Jessica's client, Ben Mitchell,

41:34.236 --> 41:35.471
who found the body.

42:16.578 --> 42:18.100
Miss me?

42:19.305 --> 42:25.784
