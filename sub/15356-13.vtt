WEBVTT

00:50.520 --> 00:52.004
These will make good japchae.

00:52.782 --> 00:53.805
Have you tasted that brand before?

00:53.975 --> 00:56.815
But, it would be so much better
without these vegetables.

00:57.193 --> 00:58.974
Oh!
The tomatoes!

02:00.255 --> 02:02.866
Kim Na Na, are you okay?

02:03.345 --> 02:04.666
Isn't...

02:05.136 --> 02:07.259
that your father?

02:08.085 --> 02:10.678
Let's go for now.
We'll talk later.

02:15.611 --> 02:17.521
Kim Jong Shik's 200 billion won...

02:17.646 --> 02:20.398
that was father's response
to my method of returning it.

02:20.779 --> 02:24.697
I'll keep doing it my way even if it means
being at odds with my father.

02:24.765 --> 02:27.521
And I'm going to protect
those around me too.

02:27.775 --> 02:29.330
Shik Joong ahjussi...

02:29.481 --> 02:31.165
my mom...

02:31.605 --> 02:33.184
and you too.

02:33.302 --> 02:35.670
Just promise me one thing.

02:36.145 --> 02:41.265
If I ever get into a dangerous situation
again, like today

02:42.275 --> 02:44.327
don't save me.

02:44.655 --> 02:47.488
We were lucky today,
so we are both fine,

02:47.625 --> 02:50.006
but who knows what will happen next time?

02:50.185 --> 02:53.095
I don't like it when you're in danger
because of me.

02:53.155 --> 02:55.555
I also don't like it when you get hurt
because of me.

02:55.755 --> 02:57.538
and I definitely don't want you
to have a hard time because of me...

02:57.541 --> 02:59.155
Stop it.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.335
- Lee Yoon Sung...
- I said stop it.

03:02.365 --> 03:04.245
You almost died because of me!

03:04.265 --> 03:06.464
Please, I said that's enough!

03:34.995 --> 03:37.516
Did you buy everything from the market?

03:41.065 --> 03:42.676
What's wrong with him?

03:44.065 --> 03:45.065
Did you guys fight?

03:45.105 --> 03:46.245
Today...

03:46.445 --> 03:48.365
we saw Lee Yoon Sung's father.

03:48.415 --> 03:50.915
B... Boss?

03:51.295 --> 03:52.215
At the market?

03:52.285 --> 03:53.028
Yeah.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.505
Are you okay?

03:54.705 --> 03:55.725
I'm okay.

03:55.795 --> 03:57.205
There's no way you could be fine.

03:57.325 --> 03:58.965
Do you know what sort of man the boss is?

03:59.045 --> 04:02.545
He even stole a newborn baby
from his mother and raised him like this.

04:02.665 --> 04:04.407
Are you really okay?

04:13.785 --> 04:16.545
What are you going to do from here on out?

04:16.825 --> 04:18.834
Are you just going to let Yoon Sung
be like this?

04:18.935 --> 04:20.825
At the Golden Triangle,

04:20.964 --> 04:23.740
he lost it
and started waving his gun around,

04:23.741 --> 04:26.243
when the woman who raised him was killed.

04:28.495 --> 04:31.037
I just have to make him like that again.

04:38.465 --> 04:39.675
Let's talk.

04:39.755 --> 04:41.445
Do you only think about yourself?

04:42.005 --> 04:44.085
Is everything fine if you're okay?

04:44.505 --> 04:46.545
How can I ignore it if you're in danger?

04:46.575 --> 04:48.625
I know better than anyone
that every single day is a war for you

04:48.665 --> 04:50.525
and that every moment is a struggle,

04:50.555 --> 04:52.745
so how can I lean on you?

04:52.995 --> 04:55.437
How can I ask you to protect me as well?

04:55.585 --> 04:59.415
I'm going to become someone
you can lean on.

04:59.645 --> 05:01.567
I'm going to become stronger,

05:01.775 --> 05:04.175
so I can protect you.

05:11.855 --> 05:14.615
What exactly do you eat
to become this brave?

05:14.645 --> 05:18.945
So, just now you thought,
"This girl is really cool," right?

05:18.995 --> 05:20.165
What?

05:22.145 --> 05:23.679
You thought...

05:23.811 --> 05:27.465
"I really have a good eye
when it comes to women," right?

05:27.785 --> 05:28.785
Forget it.

05:28.855 --> 05:30.616
If you're finished talking,
get out.

05:30.735 --> 05:34.397
What kind of a woman just walks
into a guy's room without a second thought?

05:34.695 --> 05:37.715
And... if you say something like that again,

05:37.805 --> 05:39.876
I won't leave you alone.

05:41.435 --> 05:43.995
Stop getting so angry,
you're making me feel bad.

05:44.365 --> 05:47.835
This is a robbery, a robbery.

05:48.395 --> 05:51.845
The City Hunter
stole our university's operating funds

05:51.925 --> 05:54.049
and to increase his popularity,

05:54.129 --> 05:56.756
he distributed it to our students.

05:57.055 --> 05:58.843
If you only listen
to the City Hunter's side,

05:58.963 --> 06:01.616
then you're looking at our university
with tinted glasses.

06:01.985 --> 06:05.095
But that money
was absolutely never put to personal use.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.686
Then why was that money found in your home?

06:08.885 --> 06:12.995
The banks are facing bankruptcy and closure
because of the bad economy,

06:13.425 --> 06:17.756
and so I placed it in the safest place,
my house.

06:19.105 --> 06:20.655
Due to this case,

06:20.865 --> 06:24.595
our university
is facing critical operational hardship.

06:24.725 --> 06:29.626
Therefore, we are in a situation where
we have no choice but to raise tuition fees.

06:35.425 --> 06:36.845
What are you doing?

06:40.008 --> 06:41.846
[Myung Mun University]

06:41.895 --> 06:43.685
It's so tiny.

06:43.785 --> 06:46.425
If you hide it in there,
it's completely unnoticeable.

06:46.555 --> 06:49.487
These can't even be detected
by the bug sweepers, right?

06:50.015 --> 06:52.855
Either way,
these advancements in technology,

06:52.975 --> 06:55.466
just mean more trouble
for us Security Service agents.

06:55.755 --> 06:57.915
If you're going to act like an agent,
just leave.

06:58.005 --> 07:00.305
Oh, sorry.
I said it without thinking.

07:00.435 --> 07:03.186
My job is to find these kinds of things.

07:03.545 --> 07:06.186
But, when are you going to go place this?

07:06.475 --> 07:08.015
You don't need to know!

07:08.185 --> 07:12.439
You said you're going to guard;
so guard then, not me, but this house.

07:14.804 --> 07:16.745
Oh, that unlucky jerk...

07:27.765 --> 07:28.975
Hey!

07:34.735 --> 07:37.196
Guarding the house isn't my style.

07:37.835 --> 07:39.270
What are you doing?
Let's go.

07:39.765 --> 07:41.568
We're going to be late.

07:43.235 --> 07:45.329
Hurry, we're late.

07:50.635 --> 07:53.126
I'm sure that Kim Na Na and Bae Man Deok

07:53.285 --> 07:55.545
know the City Hunter.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.946
They've both just disappeared.

07:58.615 --> 07:59.754
Bae Man Deok

07:59.832 --> 08:02.316
will be hard to find as all traces
of his identity have been erased.

08:02.395 --> 08:06.486
But, I've sent the guys to watch
those who know Kim Na Na.

08:06.755 --> 08:09.159
We'll find them soon.

08:11.915 --> 08:13.265
If you find them,

08:13.355 --> 08:15.284
kill them.

08:17.215 --> 08:19.419
Since they stole my money,

08:19.575 --> 08:22.283
they'll have to pay the price for it.

08:22.595 --> 08:24.215
The City Hunter...

08:24.695 --> 08:27.283
will definitely come find me for revenge.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.627
Kyung Hee disappeared?

08:29.845 --> 08:31.319
From the hospital?

08:31.535 --> 08:32.919
Yeah.

08:33.924 --> 08:35.565
Her health isn't too good

08:35.674 --> 08:37.135
and I can't find her.

08:37.224 --> 08:40.244
Do you happen to know
her cell phone number?

08:40.304 --> 08:43.455
I don't.
It's been a while since I've contacted her.

08:43.515 --> 08:47.718
Then by any chance,
do you know who she's close to?

08:47.975 --> 08:50.410
I don't know.

08:50.995 --> 08:55.505
She's like that, she doesn't say much
and doesn't express her feelings.

08:55.655 --> 08:59.416
And there are a lot of mysterious things
about her.

09:02.265 --> 09:03.465
Okay, I see.

09:04.305 --> 09:05.418
Thank you.

09:06.555 --> 09:07.955
Ah, seriously...

09:08.025 --> 09:10.409
Why did this car suddenly stop?

09:10.535 --> 09:11.665
Maybe it got overheated.

09:11.815 --> 09:13.459
Do you have the engine coolant?

09:14.505 --> 09:16.025
Ah, seriously...

09:16.085 --> 09:18.961
The Myung Mun University chairman
will be angry that we're late.

09:19.575 --> 09:21.792
They should have had this car
checked regularly.

09:29.665 --> 09:31.435
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:31.635 --> 09:34.367
We went to buy some ice coffee,
but the car broke down.

09:34.545 --> 09:36.295
We've called for emergency backup.

09:36.765 --> 09:37.825

09:37.855 --> 09:41.135
The chairman has a lot of guests today,
so you don't have to come in.

09:41.245 --> 09:43.778

That's good.</i>

09:43.885 --> 09:45.654

Wow...
You're really good at acting!

[City Hunter Steals 200 Billion Won from
Myung Mun University's Scholarship Fund]

10:16.415 --> 10:18.952
What?
A sick day?

10:19.375 --> 10:22.851
She doesn't take a sick day
unless it's really bad.

10:23.715 --> 10:26.263
Anyway, I understand.

10:26.745 --> 10:28.371
Na Na...

10:29.006 --> 10:30.879
Did something happen to her?

10:31.065 --> 10:33.025
She hasn't picked up her phone
in a couple days,

10:33.115 --> 10:35.649
I'm so worried.
Aigoo...

10:35.755 --> 10:37.999
Did something happen to Na Na?

10:39.065 --> 10:41.095
I went to the house yesterday
and she wasn't there.

10:41.175 --> 10:43.125
Her phone is off.

10:43.495 --> 10:45.515
And according to her co-worker,

10:45.635 --> 10:48.615
her uncle called
and said she's going to take some sick days.

10:48.695 --> 10:50.244
But the only uncle that Na Na has

10:50.347 --> 10:53.955
is a distant uncle
she doesn't keep in contact with.

10:54.155 --> 10:57.978
By any chance,
has she been in contact with you?

10:58.335 --> 10:59.396
No.

10:59.565 --> 11:01.325
If she even took days off,

The Attorney General and I know
you're Chairman Kim Jong Shik's son,

11:44.215 --> 11:45.235
so how can we let you handle it?

11:45.255 --> 11:47.125
It's a basic rule that prosecutors can't
work on cases that involve their families.

but please let me continue investigating
the City Hunter.

A strong suspect?

12:01.525 --> 12:05.225
Then... hand that over to Ha Dong Wook
as well and get off the case.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.025
Director!

12:06.065 --> 12:07.552

just to hear people say,

12:07.574 --> 12:09.095
"They went easy on him because he's family,"

12:09.205 --> 12:10.624
or "They covered up the case."

to argue with me,

to your father instead.

It's not that I suspect you,

how could the son not know?

career is ruined because of family.

to get covered with sh*t. Yeah?

so the office is empty.

- All right.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.670

Okay, then I'll go there and wait.

14:12.005 --> 14:15.495
I'm sorry, but the Chairman told me
to stay in the room while you're here.

14:15.545 --> 14:16.544
I understand.

14:16.545 --> 14:21.347

tend not to trust people in general.

14:34.965 --> 14:36.895
Should I let Chairman Kim know?

14:36.975 --> 14:40.000
No...
Let me double check it.

14:49.785 --> 14:51.695
Oh, it's working fine again.

14:51.735 --> 14:54.376
Oh, that's a relief.

14:54.455 --> 14:57.515
For a brief second the sensor went off,
but it was a false alarm.

14:57.885 --> 15:00.326
Oh, can I get a drink of water?

15:00.405 --> 15:02.705
I got a little nervous, so I became thirsty.

15:02.765 --> 15:04.071
Oh, yeah.

15:04.235 --> 15:05.025
Okay.

15:45.085 --> 15:48.895
Right now, the security team is here
inspecting the office for bugging devices.

15:49.005 --> 15:50.525
Do you want some coffee?

15:50.615 --> 15:51.595
I'm okay.

15:51.705 --> 15:55.045
It's going to be a while
before the chairman returns.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.495
I'll wait.

15:57.035 --> 15:57.915
Okay.

16:17.355 --> 16:19.254
These days...

16:19.505 --> 16:22.435
the latest bugging devices from the US

16:22.565 --> 16:27.990
interrupt with the radio frequency spectrum
analysis, making them difficult to detect.

16:29.675 --> 16:33.125
So, are you able to detect the frequency?

16:52.265 --> 16:53.635
Yes, Na Na?

16:54.385 --> 16:56.399
Yeah, it's Kim Na Na.

16:57.255 --> 16:59.425
Prosecutor, where are you right now?

16:59.485 --> 17:01.225
I can't really hear you.

17:01.845 --> 17:07.576
H... Hello... He... I can't...
Are you... He... llo?

17:08.505 --> 17:09.935
Oh, okay.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.756
Yeah, can you hear me now?

17:17.395 --> 17:19.515
Your aunt was really worried.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.335
I heard you took sick days.

17:21.464 --> 17:22.964
Are you really sick?

17:23.255 --> 17:26.875
I hurt my arm, but I'm okay.

17:27.244 --> 17:30.265
But the signal is still kind of bad.

17:30.325 --> 17:32.191
Oh, hold on.

17:43.695 --> 17:46.385
Oh, I can hear you better now.

17:46.495 --> 17:49.538
Tell my aunt not to worry about me.

17:51.125 --> 17:53.245
Are you at your uncle's house?

17:53.795 --> 17:54.845
Yeah.

17:54.995 --> 17:59.209
It's been a while since I've seen him,
so I'm going to stay a couple more days.

17:59.985 --> 18:02.725
Then, I'll call you again.

18:02.815 --> 18:03.845
Take care.

18:09.195 --> 18:12.985
Lee Yoon Sung is going to get mad
if he finds out I brought my cell phone.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.864
It's odd that
a Private University Foundation

18:26.865 --> 18:28.989
suddenly wants to hold a meeting tomorrow.

18:29.205 --> 18:31.786
When times are sweet, they swallow; when
the taste turns bitter, they spit it out.

18:31.895 --> 18:33.935
Find out what those guys
are plotting.

18:34.015 --> 18:35.006
Yes.

18:35.175 --> 18:37.405
The prosecutors have served you a subpoena.

18:37.445 --> 18:38.815
What should I do?

18:45.845 --> 18:47.345
Oh, you scared me!

18:47.425 --> 18:49.035
I almost bumped into them.

18:49.315 --> 18:51.907
So, that's one of
Chairman Kim Jong Shik's cars.

18:54.105 --> 18:56.055
But why did Prosecutor Kim
come to the office?

18:56.145 --> 18:58.075
Am I a prosecutor?
How would I know?

18:58.155 --> 18:59.895
Oh, the 200 billion won...

19:00.045 --> 19:02.185
He probably came here to investigate him.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.815
Yeah, he's so cool.

19:03.875 --> 19:04.965
Cool?

19:05.055 --> 19:07.226
He's getting paid to work,
do you think he'd play around?

19:07.305 --> 19:09.575
And, I told you to turn your cell phone off.

19:09.635 --> 19:13.465
Someone like Kim Jong Shik
can track you down with your phone number.

19:13.665 --> 19:16.096
Don't pick up calls
from unknown numbers too.

19:16.185 --> 19:17.161
I know.

19:17.215 --> 19:19.315
I've already turned it off.

19:23.255 --> 19:25.619
It's still not too late.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.395
Turn yourself in.

19:27.475 --> 19:29.555
Just tell the truth and ask for forgiveness.

19:29.685 --> 19:31.865
Don't you feel apologetic
towards the students and their parents

19:31.935 --> 19:34.495
for taking the tuition money
they worked so hard to earn?

19:34.625 --> 19:37.515
That day when I saw the 200 billion won
at your house...

19:38.115 --> 19:40.759
- I shouldn't have just left.
- It's my university.

19:41.565 --> 19:43.685
I founded it, and I invested in it.

19:43.795 --> 19:46.385
It's my money,
why can't I use it the way I want?

19:46.605 --> 19:48.275
Other people do it.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.945
Why am I the only one you're asking
to abide by the law?

19:51.505 --> 19:52.964
I'll tell you again,
I'm innocent.

19:52.981 --> 19:54.545
Innocent?

19:54.995 --> 19:58.185
Fooling others isn't enough,
so now you're fooling yourself too?

19:58.255 --> 19:59.575
What?

19:59.775 --> 20:01.816
When I found out you paid off the witness

20:01.940 --> 20:04.505
and turned yourself from offender
into victim.

20:04.845 --> 20:06.715
The misery nearly drove me mad.

20:06.865 --> 20:09.235
But if that was the one and only stain
in your life,

20:09.405 --> 20:10.925
then although I'm only the son,

20:11.055 --> 20:13.674
I was willing to shoulder
the responsibility of your crime,

20:14.821 --> 20:17.244
for the sake of the victims' family members.

20:18.575 --> 20:21.185
The statute of limitations has passed.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.505
- There's no crime.
- Statute of limitations?

20:23.565 --> 20:24.805
Yes, Statute of Limitations.

20:24.935 --> 20:26.565
It's been over 10 years.

20:26.735 --> 20:30.315
Even though there was a death involved,
it wasn't even a hit-and-run accident.

20:30.565 --> 20:31.391
It's over.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.585
Do you really feel no guilt at all?

20:33.885 --> 20:36.181
As a result of the accident you caused,
the wife passed away

20:36.182 --> 20:38.976
and the husband has been
in a vegetative state for over 10 years!

20:41.765 --> 20:44.125
Isn't it lucky?

20:44.855 --> 20:48.435
One died and one is in a vegetative state.

20:49.585 --> 20:50.555
What did you say?

20:50.675 --> 20:53.787
Dead people don't talk,

20:54.555 --> 20:56.655
and someone in a vegetative state...

20:56.995 --> 21:00.445
is unlikely to wake up.

21:01.625 --> 21:05.905
How lucky is it...
that those people are paying for my crime?

21:06.875 --> 21:07.855
Father...

21:07.965 --> 21:10.966
Their lives are over anyway.

21:11.495 --> 21:16.355
So what if they take the blame for me?

21:16.575 --> 21:19.778
Do you think every human life
has the same value?

21:20.705 --> 21:23.077
I'm different from those people.

21:23.275 --> 21:27.235
I've dedicated my whole life
to education in Korea.

21:27.685 --> 21:32.648
Without me...
Korea's education won't be what it is now.

21:32.845 --> 21:34.131
Punishment?

21:34.304 --> 21:35.583
Forgiveness?

21:35.746 --> 21:36.939
Confession?

21:37.045 --> 21:38.752
Screw it all!

21:41.205 --> 21:44.135
The car accident from 10 years ago,

21:44.305 --> 21:46.451
I forgot it long ago.

21:47.565 --> 21:49.105
That day,

21:49.665 --> 21:52.778
I was just a little unlucky.

21:52.955 --> 21:54.775
Just unlucky...

21:55.875 --> 21:58.915
Just a little unlucky...

22:04.735 --> 22:07.455
In that accident back then...

22:08.205 --> 22:10.475
You should've been the one
who lost your life.

22:10.735 --> 22:14.329
Then I wouldn't have to hate you so much
now.

22:15.335 --> 22:18.205
I detest the fact that I was born your son.

22:18.445 --> 22:19.305
Young Joo.

22:19.365 --> 22:23.800
Do you think... that a crime will disappear
with the passage of time?

22:25.665 --> 22:28.275
October 1983...

22:29.025 --> 22:31.528
What happened then?

22:34.505 --> 22:37.576
Why is the City Hunter
targeting you relentlessly?

22:42.515 --> 22:45.600
I don't think I can protect you this time.

22:46.355 --> 22:48.551
Please take care of yourself.

23:07.165 --> 23:10.015
<i>I founded it and I invested in it.</i>

23:10.575 --> 23:13.485
<i>It's my money,
why can't I use it the way I want?</i>

23:13.695 --> 23:15.845
<i>Other people do it.</i>

23:16.015 --> 23:18.285
<i>Why am I the only one you're asking
to abide by the law?</i>

23:18.475 --> 23:21.045
<i>I'll tell you again,
I'm innocent.</i>

23:21.255 --> 23:23.575
<i>- Innocent?
- Knock, knock.</i>

23:24.225 --> 23:26.093
- Kim Na Na coffee.
- Oh.

23:26.109 --> 23:27.845
Just text me and I'll make it.

23:27.975 --> 23:29.908
Oh, thank you.

23:30.195 --> 23:32.275
Did you find out something?

23:32.575 --> 23:34.736
Oh, it's Prosecutor Kim.

23:36.845 --> 23:38.275
Why?
Show it to me.

23:38.345 --> 23:40.655
The quality of the device isn't very good.

23:40.855 --> 23:43.467
And the camera is tilted
so the faces can't be seen clearly.

23:43.525 --> 23:45.023
I think we'll have to move the camera.

23:45.025 --> 23:48.645
I wanted to see how Prosecutor Kim
pressures Kim Jong Shik.

23:48.715 --> 23:51.185
I'm sure he'll coolly knock him out, right?

23:51.315 --> 23:53.075
Is a prosecutor a wrestler?

23:53.205 --> 23:54.545
What do you mean "knock him out"...?

23:54.635 --> 23:57.133
Get out, I have to work.

23:58.165 --> 24:00.745
It was so hard placing it,
how are we going to move it?

24:01.265 --> 24:04.585
Investigator, did you find out
the whereabouts of Lee Kyung Hee?

24:04.785 --> 24:06.185
Lee Kyung Hee?

24:06.415 --> 24:08.075
But Prosecutor...

24:08.180 --> 24:10.083
Weren't you pulled off
the City Hunter investigation?

24:10.131 --> 24:11.896
So I'll stop just because they tell me to?

24:11.955 --> 24:13.797
Ah, Prosecutor...

24:15.215 --> 24:18.426
They said they're going pass the case
to Prosecutor Ha, so let's stay out of it.

24:18.515 --> 24:21.965
We have a lot of new cases assigned to us,
Prosecutor.

24:22.035 --> 24:24.675
Something definitely went down
in October 1983.

24:24.735 --> 24:27.245
Lee Kyung Hee said at that time
her husband was a Secret Service agent,

24:27.315 --> 24:30.085
but the Blue House
has no record of him on file.

24:30.245 --> 24:32.625
We have to find Lee Kyung Hee.

24:41.925 --> 24:43.515
I understand.

24:44.785 --> 24:49.355
From now on,
I'll work on the City Hunter case on my own.

24:53.165 --> 24:55.745
But, he can't.

25:02.495 --> 25:03.995
Excuse me.

25:04.415 --> 25:07.745
Have you seen the owner
of the Madis snack stand?

25:07.975 --> 25:09.795
We haven't.

25:10.095 --> 25:13.135
We've been worried because her shop
has been closed for a couple of days now.

25:13.185 --> 25:14.785
Yeah, we're worried.

25:14.915 --> 25:17.945
She lives alone so there's no one
who takes care of her either.

25:18.015 --> 25:19.615
I guess that's her fate.

25:19.675 --> 25:23.614
It's not easy to lose your child
when he was only one month old.

25:25.055 --> 25:26.355
She lost her child?

25:26.425 --> 25:28.355
I think it was in 1983.

25:28.545 --> 25:30.355
She had a son.

25:30.765 --> 25:33.305
She went to hang the diapers out to dry
and when she turned around, he was gone.

25:33.405 --> 25:35.044
1983?

25:35.268 --> 25:37.221
You said a son, right?

25:40.605 --> 25:42.535
But, who are you?

25:42.725 --> 25:44.425
A moment ago,

25:44.615 --> 25:49.935
someone asked Min Suk's grandma
where the owner of the snack bar went.

25:50.225 --> 25:51.305
Who was it?

26:43.765 --> 26:45.814
Lee Kyung Hee and Lee Yoon Sung...

26:46.035 --> 26:47.243
So you had your blood tested

26:47.287 --> 26:50.927
to see if you're a match
to donate bone marrow because...

26:51.347 --> 26:53.323
Could it be...?

26:53.545 --> 26:56.725
You don't know
where Lee Kyung Hee is either?

27:02.995 --> 27:05.285
Lee Kyung Wan and Seo Yong Hak...

27:05.675 --> 27:07.880
For both, their corruption
was filmed by a hidden camera

27:08.016 --> 27:11.287
and then exposed to the pubic
with the release of a video.

27:11.635 --> 27:14.311
What if that technician back then...

27:14.526 --> 27:16.206
was Lee Yoon Sung?

27:19.175 --> 27:20.765
Now what is it?

27:22.365 --> 27:26.045
After talking to your father like that,
you're feeling sorry?

27:26.375 --> 27:27.645
No.

27:27.875 --> 27:29.895
Since the Prosecutor's Office
has started to investigate,

27:30.025 --> 27:32.765
I came to ask you to show up
when you receive the subpoena.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.235
What?

27:34.236 --> 27:36.585
I thought you might use the
predictable excuse of chronic health issues

27:36.620 --> 27:38.440
like others do to refuse.

27:40.005 --> 27:42.675
You seem to think you can read my mind.

27:45.745 --> 27:47.561
Yeah, Investigator Jang.

27:47.681 --> 27:50.895
What?
You located Lee Kyung Hee?

27:51.185 --> 27:54.090
Oh, Dangjin...
Hae Shim Orphanage.

27:54.415 --> 27:56.435
I got it.
I'll be right there.

27:57.155 --> 27:58.945
You're a lot skinnier than before.

27:59.895 --> 28:02.305
Come home sometime and let's eat together.

28:02.465 --> 28:04.095
I'm busy.

28:10.035 --> 28:12.735
<i>Oh, Dangjin...
Hae Shim Orphanage.</i>

28:12.865 --> 28:15.068
Dangjin, Hae Shim Orphanage?

28:29.595 --> 28:32.435
[Hae Shim Orphanage]

28:47.365 --> 28:48.976
Excuse me.

28:51.405 --> 28:53.785
I'm Prosecutor Kim
from Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.

28:54.375 --> 28:57.995
In a little while a man will come
looking for Lee Kyung Hee.

28:58.225 --> 29:01.805
Could you direct him
to the inside of the church?

29:02.535 --> 29:04.338
Please help me.

29:04.975 --> 29:06.371
Okay.

29:25.445 --> 29:28.545
Hurry up and come,
Lee Yoon Sung.

29:37.185 --> 29:39.175
[Hae Shim Orphanage]

30:08.098 --> 30:11.385
Are you looking for Lee Kyung Hee?

30:11.545 --> 30:15.065
Yes.
Lee Kyung Hee is here, right?

30:15.295 --> 30:17.081
Follow me, please.

30:25.614 --> 30:27.242
Sorry.

30:40.635 --> 30:42.265
It's this way.

30:51.745 --> 30:54.325
Lee Kyung Hee's leg has been bothering her.

30:54.655 --> 30:56.475
Is she adjusting well to life here?

30:56.545 --> 30:58.475
Oh... yes.

30:58.695 --> 31:02.865
She has improved a lot since she came here.

31:03.225 --> 31:04.865
Please go in.

32:00.905 --> 32:01.885
What is it?

32:02.045 --> 32:03.815
Where have you been?

32:05.045 --> 32:07.715
You seem to be very curious about me.

32:07.845 --> 32:09.415
But I think I've told you before,

32:09.515 --> 32:11.144
if you want to question me,
then bring a certificate or something first.

32:11.145 --> 32:13.485
Oh, a warrant?

32:14.205 --> 32:17.075
You must have done something wrong
if you won't talk without a warrant.

32:17.275 --> 32:19.195
A jab is no fun.

32:19.515 --> 32:21.865
Wouldn't it be better to be an infighter
and throw a single knockout punch?

32:21.995 --> 32:24.280
Or, if you don't have a straight punch,
then stay out of the game.

32:24.409 --> 32:26.149
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

32:28.815 --> 32:31.265
There's dirt on your clothes.

32:32.825 --> 32:36.468
The kids at the Hae Shim Orphanage
were playing ball.

32:37.285 --> 32:38.949
Hae Shim Orphanage?

32:39.245 --> 32:40.125
What's that?

32:40.285 --> 32:44.005
We can look at the security tapes
at the Dangjin toll gates to prove it.

32:44.135 --> 32:47.855
But since you're so careful,
you probably changed your license plate.

32:47.955 --> 32:50.354
Did you say
a single knockout straight punch?

32:50.418 --> 32:51.736
Oh, dear...

32:52.415 --> 32:55.055
I like to be straight forward
and not beat around the bush.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.097
You talk too much.

33:18.465 --> 33:20.543
<i>This is the last time I'll ask.</i>

33:20.685 --> 33:22.278
<i>Please turn yourself in.</i>

33:22.453 --> 33:24.989
<i>Otherwise, something even bigger
is going to happen.</i>

33:57.117 --> 33:58.367
Bota Temple?

34:00.135 --> 34:01.959
The air is so nice...

34:22.955 --> 34:24.065
Oh, my...

34:24.235 --> 34:27.295
Oh, God.
What do I do?

34:27.815 --> 34:30.495
It just fell in.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.495
It won't turn on.

34:32.645 --> 34:35.255
I'm so stupid.

34:38.804 --> 34:40.364
Oh, Sseunim*. (*Korean term
for addressing a Buddhist priest)

34:40.665 --> 34:42.844
Namu Amitabul, Kwan Seum Bosal*.
(*Mantra: Honor Buddha, Avalokitesvara,
Bodhisattva of compassion)

34:43.074 --> 34:46.205
By any chance,
in this temple...

34:46.795 --> 34:49.304
Is there someone who looks like this?

34:49.625 --> 34:51.554
The one in the middle...

34:52.955 --> 34:56.735
I'm not a bad guy, I'm not dangerous at all.
Really I'm not.

34:57.065 --> 34:58.445
You see...

34:58.567 --> 35:01.673
Her name is Lee Kyung Hee
and she is ill.

35:01.832 --> 35:04.084
She disappeared from the hospital.

35:04.201 --> 35:06.875
I think she disappeared
because she lost her will to live.

35:07.045 --> 35:09.355
Her son is anxious to find her.

35:09.585 --> 35:13.079
But... Lee Kyung Hee doesn't have a son.

35:13.405 --> 35:14.918
Ah, yeah...

35:15.061 --> 35:17.345
Yes, everyone thinks that,
but that's not the case.

35:17.475 --> 35:20.435
She has a son who's alive and well
and works at the Blue House,

35:20.554 --> 35:23.461
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung.
He's a very handsome young man.

35:23.475 --> 35:26.085
He's really eager to find her.
Please help me.

35:26.705 --> 35:28.295
Ah, seriously...
Have people conned you all your life?

35:28.365 --> 35:31.425
It's true!
Please believe me, Priestess.

35:31.465 --> 35:32.175
Please.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.322
Are you sure it's that room?

36:01.715 --> 36:03.965
You're saying she's not coming back today,

36:04.095 --> 36:06.434
tomorrow, or the day after that...

36:06.535 --> 36:09.645
or two days after tomorrow
or three days after tomorrow?

36:09.805 --> 36:11.925
She went to the Buddhist nunnery to pray.

36:12.025 --> 36:14.305
They go from temple to temple praying.

36:14.365 --> 36:17.535
I really don't know when she'll be back.

36:17.625 --> 36:21.605
Ah... She should have taken
her cell phone at least.

36:21.895 --> 36:24.245
There's no signal in the temples.

36:24.445 --> 36:28.530
Why would you take it if it's a nuisance
and gets in the way of praying?

36:30.345 --> 36:32.265
Oh, yeah...

36:33.995 --> 36:36.835
I'll give you my cell phone number.

36:37.025 --> 36:39.679
It dropped in the water so it won't work.
Ah, then...

36:39.888 --> 36:43.255
I'll give you Lee Kyung Hee's son's
phone number, Dr. Lee Yoon Sung.

36:43.355 --> 36:44.646
When she comes back

36:44.775 --> 36:47.755
please... please...
please...

36:47.855 --> 36:50.625
As soon as possible please,
have her call him. Please.

36:50.785 --> 36:52.937
Okay, then.

36:53.126 --> 36:54.605
I'll make sure to have her call
when she returns.

36:54.695 --> 36:56.885
Please, please, I'm begging you kindly.

36:57.045 --> 36:59.525
Then, I'll be going.

37:11.585 --> 37:15.510
- Did the monks personally make these?
- Yes.

37:20.722 --> 37:23.015
Take this box over to
Prosecutor Ha Dong Wook's office.

37:23.446 --> 37:24.604
Yes.

37:36.955 --> 37:40.215
Oh, I had an MP3 like that one.

37:40.475 --> 37:43.405
That was... 9 years ago,
10 years ago.

37:43.605 --> 37:45.595
It was a present
from my girlfriend back then.

37:46.535 --> 37:48.785
That brings back all those memories.

37:50.385 --> 37:53.174
Did you also get that from a girlfriend?

37:53.208 --> 37:55.765
It was a present from my dad
for getting into college.

37:55.895 --> 37:57.525
Ah...

37:57.955 --> 38:01.405
So you kept it till now
because it's a present from your dad.

38:01.635 --> 38:03.495
Are you not going?
Should I go?

38:03.555 --> 38:04.847
No, I'm going.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.927
I'll go right now.

38:14.055 --> 38:17.255
<i>The type of prosecutor you aspire to be,
is like an upright bamboo.</i>

38:17.385 --> 38:23.385
<i>They protect justice, truth, human rights,
impartiality, and integrity.</i>

38:23.615 --> 38:28.045
<i>If they fall, then all of these things
become mere encyclopedia terms.</i>

38:28.205 --> 38:33.295
<i>In fact, I believe they would only exist
as words in a dictionary.</i>

38:33.425 --> 38:35.168
<i>Young Joo,</i>

38:35.385 --> 38:40.441
<i>I hope you become a prosecutor who protects
the justice of the Republic of S. Korea.</i>

39:02.275 --> 39:03.734
This isn't...

39:03.903 --> 39:05.864
another attempt on your part to investigate?

39:06.088 --> 39:06.561
That's...

39:06.569 --> 39:08.960
This is the elite Hae Won Jae Club.

39:09.325 --> 39:12.881
You won't believe it's just a coincidence,
but we're both members.

39:12.903 --> 39:14.535
You pretend you're not, but

39:14.765 --> 39:17.456
you must be from a wealthy family.

39:17.575 --> 39:18.919
Your father...

39:19.067 --> 39:21.497
is Chairman Kim Jong Shik, right?

39:27.615 --> 39:31.330
You've revealed to Kim Na Na that you're
Long Leg Ahjussi*. (* secret benefactor)

39:31.595 --> 39:33.805
When are you going to come clean
about being Kim Jong Shik's son?

39:33.875 --> 39:35.969
That's not something
you need to concern yourself about.

39:36.039 --> 39:39.037
There's a limit
to playing around with people.

39:39.315 --> 39:40.792
People like you...

39:40.948 --> 39:43.207
slap a person and then turn around
and offer candy. Isn't that a bit much?

39:43.395 --> 39:45.805
As Long Leg Ahjussi,
you supported her,

39:45.875 --> 39:49.265
but it turns out you're the son of the enemy
who injured and killed her parents.

39:49.531 --> 39:51.965
What do you think is going to happen
if she finds out?

39:52.095 --> 39:53.305
Have you thought about how she'll feel?

39:53.335 --> 39:57.131
You talk about Kim Na Na like
you know her better than I.

39:57.675 --> 39:59.925
Back off from Kim Na Na completely,

40:00.055 --> 40:02.480
if you want to really be remembered
as Long Leg Ahjussi.

40:02.695 --> 40:05.795
Is what why you saved her?
At the broadcasting station,

40:05.925 --> 40:09.545
you saved her even though it meant
losing Seo Yong Hak...

40:10.715 --> 40:12.941
City Hunter.

40:13.875 --> 40:16.585
I told you that a jab is no fun.

40:16.775 --> 40:19.170
Apparently your memory
is worse than I thought.

40:19.325 --> 40:21.791
I can become a prosecutor too.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.655
Oh, you're back?

40:32.915 --> 40:35.091
What's so hard that you have
that "I'm going to die" look on your face?

40:35.198 --> 40:37.325
Chief, you don't understand.

40:37.455 --> 40:40.095
It's so hard guarding Da Hye all day.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.895
When Doctor Lee Yoon Sung tutored her
on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

40:42.995 --> 40:45.115
she wouldn't waste a minute
and come back.

40:45.305 --> 40:48.375
But now she only thinks
about ways to run away.

40:48.535 --> 40:50.915
I told you she's unique, didn't I?

40:51.145 --> 40:54.165
Is Dr. Lee Yoon Sung
really not going to return,

40:54.435 --> 40:56.295
and be her tutor five days a week?

40:56.585 --> 40:59.482
I'm really going through a hard time.

41:03.015 --> 41:04.259
Boo!

41:04.615 --> 41:06.156
Where are you going?

41:06.725 --> 41:08.625
Someone came to see me.

41:08.755 --> 41:10.773
They said it's some man.

41:12.635 --> 41:14.165
A man?

41:15.175 --> 41:15.895
A man? Who?

41:16.055 --> 41:18.105
How would I know?

41:20.945 --> 41:23.685
Aish! Who is it?

41:24.175 --> 41:27.595
Did she have a meeting* without me?
(*friends introduce each other's friends)

41:27.885 --> 41:31.275
She loves me...
she loves me not.

41:31.415 --> 41:34.675
She loves me...
she loves me not.

41:35.385 --> 41:38.175
She loves me...
she loves me not.

41:40.245 --> 41:42.189
I wonder who's here?

41:43.055 --> 41:44.815
Who is it?

41:48.365 --> 41:50.515
It's me, Shin Eun Ah.

41:50.645 --> 41:53.585
Oh, you're Lee Yoon Sung's uncle.

41:53.805 --> 41:55.665
- Hello.
- Hello.

41:55.895 --> 41:57.696
What are you doing...?

41:59.025 --> 42:00.855
I came to give you this.

42:00.955 --> 42:01.995
It's green tea.

42:02.095 --> 42:03.105
Yeah.

42:03.465 --> 42:05.905
The moment I smelled this green tea,

42:06.065 --> 42:08.935
I immediately thought of you.

42:09.035 --> 42:10.477
Oh, oh dear.

42:10.749 --> 42:12.985
Agent Shin doesn't like green tea
because it's bitter.

42:13.115 --> 42:14.304
Oh, really?

42:14.405 --> 42:16.405
That's because
you leave it in the water too long.

42:16.535 --> 42:20.545
If you follow the directions written here,
the flavor will be really great.

42:20.745 --> 42:22.098
Ah, Lee Yoon Sung.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.195
He doesn't have to take care of me
this much.

42:24.196 --> 42:24.795
What?

42:24.815 --> 42:28.695
When you go home, make sure to tell
Lee Yoon Sung that I'll drink it well.

42:28.855 --> 42:31.465
I'll drink it well, thank you.

42:33.165 --> 42:36.455
Hey, hey...
I want to see if it's good too.

42:36.845 --> 42:38.686
Agent Shin.

42:39.615 --> 42:42.349
Lee Yoon Sung didn't buy it, I did.

42:47.545 --> 42:50.575
<i>The phone is turned off,
so please leave a message...</i>

42:53.415 --> 42:55.755
Why isn't he picking up?

42:56.405 --> 42:59.475
Kim Na Na. Ahjussi didn't tell you
where he was going?

42:59.605 --> 43:02.445
No, he didn't say anything.

43:03.875 --> 43:06.875
It wouldn't be Kim Jong Shik...

43:07.755 --> 43:09.645
No, right?

43:15.485 --> 43:16.885
Hello?

43:18.315 --> 43:20.243
Agent Shin?

43:21.025 --> 43:24.122
I gave you... green tea from the temple?

43:24.615 --> 43:26.175
My uncle came to the Blue House?

43:26.275 --> 43:27.575
Blue House?

43:27.805 --> 43:32.795
Blue House... Didn't Kim Jong Shik send
those scary guys of his there, to find me?

43:32.925 --> 43:34.795
When did he stop by?

43:36.345 --> 43:38.113
Just now?

43:38.535 --> 43:41.060
Oh, yeah, please enjoy it.

43:41.995 --> 43:43.195
I'm going.

43:43.395 --> 43:45.055
Ahjussi really has some guts...

43:45.215 --> 43:46.915
I'm going too!

44:03.285 --> 44:04.685
Ahjussi.

44:30.765 --> 44:33.115
Ahjussi... Ahjussi!

44:33.575 --> 44:34.585
Ahjussi...

44:35.035 --> 44:36.275
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Ahjussi.</i>

44:36.375 --> 44:37.418
<i>- Wake up, Ahjussi!
- Ahjussi!</i>

44:37.473 --> 44:38.971
Ahjussi!

44:47.195 --> 44:48.635
5453...

44:53.755 --> 44:55.317
Kim Jong Shik.

44:56.887 --> 44:58.079
Ahjussi...

44:58.315 --> 44:59.495
Ahjussi, open your eyes.

44:59.625 --> 45:00.949
Ahjussi!

45:01.006 --> 45:02.975
Ahjussi, wake up!

45:03.064 --> 45:06.938
- Yoon Sung, calm down.
- Ahjussi. Ahjussi...

45:11.265 --> 45:13.245
We've got a line in.

45:13.735 --> 45:14.615
He's in asystole.

45:14.685 --> 45:17.029
- Start CPR and get me some epinephrine.
- Yes.

45:18.565 --> 45:20.905
- Check pulses and rhythm.
- Still asystole.

45:22.345 --> 45:23.770
Ahjussi...

45:25.995 --> 45:28.719
- Check pulses and rhythm.
- Still asystole.

45:31.245 --> 45:32.395
Ahjussi...

45:33.072 --> 45:35.035
Please don't die...

45:35.140 --> 45:36.924
Don't die.

45:42.565 --> 45:44.514
Ahjussi!!

45:57.065 --> 45:58.385
Check pulses and rhythm.

45:58.710 --> 46:01.302
It's back up to 68 bpm.

46:26.865 --> 46:30.474
There are no major external injuries,
but there is some internal bleeding.

46:30.655 --> 46:33.915
We'll only know the extent of the bleeding
once we go into surgery,

46:34.105 --> 46:37.399
There's a possibility he might not make
it through the surgery.

46:37.695 --> 46:40.149
Please save him, Doctor.

46:40.405 --> 46:41.584
Yes.

46:48.325 --> 46:50.540
I'm leaving him in your hands.

47:16.395 --> 47:19.709
The emotions you're feeling right now...

47:20.215 --> 47:23.145
I... know them well.

47:23.505 --> 47:27.515
When my dad
was lying like this in his coma,

47:27.745 --> 47:31.569
I thought about it
hundreds of times a day...

47:33.575 --> 47:37.065
If I wasn't a powerless student,

47:37.715 --> 47:41.075
If only I could drive...

47:41.795 --> 47:43.685
Kim Jong Shik...

47:43.845 --> 47:46.860
I would get back at him for what he did,

47:47.066 --> 47:49.745
using the same exact method.

47:51.686 --> 47:54.256
The look in your eyes right now,

47:54.475 --> 47:58.527
is the same as mine back then.
It makes me nervous...

47:58.615 --> 48:00.115
I...

48:02.595 --> 48:05.957
think I understand a little now,
how my dad feels.

48:06.475 --> 48:07.845
Maybe...

48:08.655 --> 48:11.265
even that's being too kind

48:11.955 --> 48:14.059
to those guys.

48:18.345 --> 48:20.439
Please watch over Ahjussi.

48:21.215 --> 48:23.090
Lee Yoon Sung...

49:08.485 --> 49:10.505
I got a call from the Ministry of Justice.

49:10.735 --> 49:13.976
They're going to give you an award
at the ceremony this year.

49:14.455 --> 49:15.196
To me?

49:15.275 --> 49:18.565
That case involving the corrupt mayor and
the embezzlement and abuse of power case,

49:18.695 --> 49:20.999
for cleanly solving those 2 cases,

49:21.180 --> 49:22.027
they picked you.

49:22.085 --> 49:24.755
Does it look to you
like I work to receive awards?

49:24.875 --> 49:27.017
Stop giving your superior an attitude
all the time, okay?

49:27.075 --> 49:28.829
If you keep acting this way,

49:28.830 --> 49:30.774
because you keep letting
the City Hunter escape,

49:30.775 --> 49:33.529
the workplace gossip
of you getting demoted to Marado, well

49:33.564 --> 49:35.815
I can make that a reality.

49:35.945 --> 49:36.590
Director...

49:36.634 --> 49:38.155
The ceremony hall is small,

49:38.205 --> 49:40.826
so you can only invite 10 guests.

49:41.025 --> 49:43.406
Here's your guest list.
Take a look.

49:50.355 --> 49:52.559
I think you can scratch him off the list.

49:55.345 --> 49:57.176
I'm going to leave first.

[Kim Jong Shik, Myung Mun University]

50:05.085 --> 50:08.125

50:09.095 --> 50:11.415
Forget it, you read it and handle it.

50:11.575 --> 50:14.557
Your son sent it.

50:32.545 --> 50:34.665
Yeah, Aunt. It's me.

50:35.545 --> 50:36.765
Yeah.

50:36.975 --> 50:39.975
I stayed for an extra few days
because I haven't seen Uncle in so long.

50:40.205 --> 50:42.455
You were worried, right?

50:42.645 --> 50:44.147
Yeah.

50:44.816 --> 50:46.099
What?

50:46.955 --> 50:50.115
Tell Prosecutor Kim
I said congratulations.

50:50.505 --> 50:53.965
What?
He got demoted?

50:54.195 --> 50:57.409
Why would someone who's getting an award
be demoted?

50:58.955 --> 51:02.017
Because of the City Hunter?

51:02.925 --> 51:05.283
Oh, I see.

51:06.355 --> 51:07.876
Ah, yeah.

51:08.045 --> 51:11.535
Okay.
I'll call you again.

Father.
Why are you here?

51:45.285 --> 51:47.584
You invited me to come.

51:47.755 --> 51:49.739
Congratulations.

Investigator Jang.

52:03.805 --> 52:05.097
Yes.

52:06.965 --> 52:09.087
The City Hunter will appear here today.

52:09.185 --> 52:11.656
Keep an eye on the entrances
and the broadcasting room.

52:11.885 --> 52:13.378
I understand.

52:16.485 --> 52:17.755
Director.

52:18.275 --> 52:20.555
I think the City Hunter
is going to appear.

52:20.695 --> 52:22.832
- Seal the entrances...
- Prosecutor Kim,

52:22.865 --> 52:25.017
I told you to stay off the City Hunter case.

52:25.285 --> 52:27.345
There are several hundred prosecutors here,

52:27.475 --> 52:30.237
unless he's crazy,
would he really come here?

52:30.405 --> 52:32.325
The ceremony is starting soon.

52:32.625 --> 52:34.437
Go back to your seat and sit down!

52:38.795 --> 52:41.094
- Please take care of my son.
- Yes.

52:41.137 --> 52:42.695
Thank you.

- Please take care of my son. Thank you.
- Yes.

53:29.455 --> 53:34.675
<i>This award is bestowed by the Republic of
Korea's Minister of Justice, Hwang Soon Yil.</i>

53:44.905 --> 53:48.809
Now we will listen
to Prosecutor Kim Young Joo's speech.

54:02.805 --> 54:07.145
I'm Prosecutor Kim,
the recipient of this generous award.

54:10.075 --> 54:13.335
In my mind, prosecutors...

54:24.195 --> 54:26.675
Prosecutors...

54:27.195 --> 54:28.985
are like upright bamboo.

54:29.155 --> 54:31.617
They protect justice, truth,

54:31.718 --> 54:36.745
human rights, impartiality, and integrity.

54:37.565 --> 54:39.745
If we fall,

54:39.945 --> 54:44.185
then all these things
become mere encyclopedia terms.

54:44.995 --> 54:49.005
In fact, I believe they would only exist
as words in a dictionary.

55:13.065 --> 55:17.695
There are many people who try
to take away our power,

55:17.995 --> 55:23.777
but in order to ensure that these words
won't just exist in textbooks...

55:36.215 --> 55:38.449
<i>When I found out you paid off the witness</i>

55:38.528 --> 55:41.096
<i>and turned yourself from offender
into victim.</i>

55:41.275 --> 55:43.065
<i>The misery nearly drove me mad.</i>

55:43.165 --> 55:45.835
<i>But if that was the one and only stain
in your life,</i>

55:45.935 --> 55:47.205
<i>then although I'm only the son,</i>

55:47.405 --> 55:50.580
<i>I was willing to shoulder the responsibility
of your crime,</i>

55:50.616 --> 55:53.296
<i>for the sake of the victims' family members.</i>

55:53.665 --> 55:55.745
<i>Isn't it lucky?</i>

55:56.525 --> 56:00.310
<i>One died and one is in a vegetative state.</i>

56:00.605 --> 56:02.035
<i>What did you say?</i>

56:02.755 --> 56:05.755
<i>Their lives are over anyway.</i>

56:06.245 --> 56:11.198
<i>So what if they take the blame for me?</i>

56:12.795 --> 56:16.255
<i>Do you think every human life
has the same value?></i>

56:16.585 --> 56:18.405
<i>I'm different from those people.</i>

56:18.605 --> 56:21.895
<i>I've dedicated my whole life
to this nation's education.</i>

56:22.085 --> 56:25.415
<i>Without me... Korea's education
wouldn't be what it is now.</i>

56:25.575 --> 56:26.735
<i>Punishment?</i>

56:26.836 --> 56:27.845
<i>Forgiveness?</i>

56:27.995 --> 56:28.956
<i>Confession?</i>

56:29.033 --> 56:30.396
<i>Screw it all!</i>

56:30.695 --> 56:33.005
<i>The car accident from 10 years ago,</i>

56:33.155 --> 56:34.765
<i>I forgot it long ago.</i>

56:34.985 --> 56:36.865
<i>That day,</i>

56:37.055 --> 56:39.455
<i>I was just a little unlucky.</i>

56:39.565 --> 56:41.125
<i>Just unlucky...</i>

56:41.235 --> 56:43.698
<i>Just a little unlucky...</i>

57:31.925 --> 57:35.865
The Statute of Limitations for
manslaughter in a car accident is 5 years...

57:36.035 --> 57:38.907
Even if it was involuntary manslaughter
rather than a hit-and-run,

57:38.908 --> 57:40.477
the Statute of Limitations
has already passed.

57:40.855 --> 57:43.745
He blackmailed the witness?
Isn't that a problem?

57:43.875 --> 57:45.915
How long has Prosecutor Kim
known about this?

57:46.015 --> 57:49.085
But it was his father,
so what could he do...?

57:50.085 --> 57:52.105
What's the use of having
several hundred prosecutors gathered here...

57:52.385 --> 57:54.505
if not one of you steps forward
to catch him?!

57:54.675 --> 57:57.075
Ah, this is the law, huh?
Right...

58:00.435 --> 58:02.241
Who did this?

58:02.835 --> 58:04.258
Hold on...

58:04.525 --> 58:06.657
Is the City Hunter responsible?!

58:07.945 --> 58:09.430
Father...

58:14.165 --> 58:17.115
The broadcasting room...
Go to the broadcasting room! Hey!

58:21.545 --> 58:22.639
Kim Na Na...

58:22.725 --> 58:26.755
Prosecutor Kim...
Is all of that true?

58:27.075 --> 58:30.375
You're really Kim Jong Shik's son?

58:30.825 --> 58:32.625
The father committed the crime,

58:32.815 --> 58:36.565
and the son felt bad
so he became Long Leg Ahjussi?

58:36.905 --> 58:38.275
So, not knowing any of this,

58:38.365 --> 58:41.619
I was inspired to live well
through your letters and gifts,

58:41.639 --> 58:44.255
and found the hope to survive till now.

58:44.655 --> 58:46.205
What is this?

58:46.375 --> 58:49.095
Is it pity?
Or guilt?

58:49.155 --> 58:50.745
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

58:50.935 --> 58:52.085
Let's meet later
and I'll apologize properly.

58:52.175 --> 58:53.653
- But right now...
- No.

58:53.904 --> 58:55.746
I won't accept your apology.

58:56.005 --> 58:59.395
Prosecutor Kim, you aren't the person
I knew as Long Leg Ahjussi.

58:59.475 --> 59:02.135
Na Na.. I'm really sorry.

59:02.215 --> 59:04.345
Even if you sling rocks at me,
I won't try to dodge them.

59:04.425 --> 59:06.505
But right now I have to look for my father.

59:06.635 --> 59:08.239
I'm sorry, Na Na.

59:28.175 --> 59:29.825
Wh... Who are you?

59:29.955 --> 59:31.838
Don't you already know?

59:36.165 --> 59:37.625
Don't do anything stupid,

59:37.945 --> 59:40.970
unless you want to die
in front of your son's eyes.

59:42.115 --> 59:43.438
Go.

59:54.715 --> 59:56.385
Where were you going?

59:56.685 --> 59:58.355
The party has just started.

01:00:26.175 --> 01:00:28.505
<i>That day when I saw the 200 billion won
at your house...</i>

01:00:28.675 --> 01:00:30.735
<i>I shouldn't have just left.</i>

01:00:31.055 --> 01:00:32.189
Turn it off!

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:33.610
I said turn it off!

01:00:33.815 --> 01:00:36.385
If this recording
is sent to the Prosecutor's Office,

01:00:36.865 --> 01:00:39.985
it's only a matter of time
before your son will be forced to resign.

01:00:41.225 --> 01:00:43.375
Is this retaliation
for Operation Clean Sweep?

01:00:43.475 --> 01:00:45.508
So, you still remember.

01:00:46.115 --> 01:00:48.575
The men who risked their lives
for the motherland,

01:00:48.815 --> 01:00:51.485
you obliterated them
in the waters off Nampo.

01:00:51.725 --> 01:00:54.165
And yet you lived happily,

01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:57.425
spending students' tuition money
on luxurious food and clothes,

01:00:57.825 --> 01:01:00.035
and covering up your homicide offense.

01:01:00.355 --> 01:01:01.915
You...

01:01:02.885 --> 01:01:05.679
I'm going to make sure
your son is the one to bring you to justice.

01:01:08.705 --> 01:01:11.295
All the documents proving your corruption,

01:01:11.445 --> 01:01:13.865
I'll send them exclusively
to Prosecutor Kim.

01:01:14.215 --> 01:01:16.878
If he tries to conceal these records,
he'll be ruined.

01:01:17.105 --> 01:01:20.729
And if he exposes all of this,
then both of you will still be destroyed.

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:25.346
It's going to be fun
seeing you get caught...

01:01:25.985 --> 01:01:27.948
by your own son.

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:33.240
My son...

01:01:34.005 --> 01:01:35.885
Please don't touch my son.

01:01:35.945 --> 01:01:38.329
What a touching display of paternal love,

01:01:39.165 --> 01:01:42.865
when I grew up without a father
to share such things with.

01:01:44.725 --> 01:01:47.270
If you are a real father,

01:01:48.045 --> 01:01:50.850
then what can you do
for your son?

01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:54.885
Will it be honor...

01:01:55.955 --> 01:01:57.906
or humiliation?

01:02:20.963 --> 01:02:22.427
Don't come any closer.

01:02:23.775 --> 01:02:26.499
I can't make my son suffer even more.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:45.025
<i>Nothing like dying or being killed...</i>

01:03:45.245 --> 01:03:47.269
I'd like it
if the City Hunter would catch him...

01:03:47.372 --> 01:03:50.591
and deliver him to Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

01:03:50.985 --> 01:03:55.721
I want it exposed
that he's not someone to respect.

01:03:55.995 --> 01:03:59.225
I'd like it if his hidden character
was revealed.

01:04:16.245 --> 01:04:17.425
Father!

01:04:57.285 --> 01:04:58.595
Father!!
