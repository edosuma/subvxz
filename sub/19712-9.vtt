Somehow he infected himself
with the virus he was carrying.

to go shopping,

05:01.781 --> 05:05.016
I'll go over and see Tuan

Stan.

06:08.246 --> 06:09.845
It's not absolutely
conclusive yet,

06:09.947 --> 06:13.148
but they just translated
an intercept from Thailand

06:13.251 --> 06:15.684
showing travel for a group
of known KGB officers

06:15.786 --> 06:17.019
coming in and out

Gaad was murdered.

06:19.323 --> 06:21.490
There was nothing else
going on in Thailand

06:21.592 --> 06:23.291

06:25.095 --> 06:27.195
I know how you feel
about squeezing Burov,

06:27.297 --> 06:30.599
but it might take years for us
to get somebody like that

06:30.701 --> 06:32.200

06:33.203 --> 06:35.069
I could be next
on their list.

06:35.171 --> 06:36.371
Or you.

06:36.473 --> 06:39.774
Any of us
can be a target.

06:39.876 --> 06:41.776

He's vulnerable.

Let us use the tape
against him

06:43.546 --> 06:46.214

I waited until 3:00 AM.

11:37.198 --> 11:39.931

11:40.033 --> 11:41.633
What?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.402
(zipper opens)

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
I don't know.

11:48.342 --> 11:49.774
Out in the middle
of the night...

11:49.876 --> 11:51.810
What, you think
he's reporting on us?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.912
To who?
His people?

11:54.014 --> 11:55.146
The Centre
talked to them.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.147
I know.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.315
Not the Americans.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.350
I can't imagine.

12:01.955 --> 12:05.256
I went through the house.
I didn't find anything.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.391
Okay.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.427
I mean, it would make sense
that he's out with those kids

12:09.529 --> 12:12.697
if-- if he's trying to work
them against Pasha, but...

12:12.798 --> 12:15.566
3:00 AM just seems
a little late.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.235
Yeah.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.039
It didn't feel right.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.778
We'll check it out.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.948
Have Norm and Marilyn...

12:31.050 --> 12:32.082
Yeah.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.157
I, uh...

12:41.260 --> 12:44.327
I was at Kimmy's
a few days ago.

12:44.429 --> 12:49.031
And on the tape, um...

12:49.134 --> 12:53.703
a group of Mujahideen died
of a hemorrhagic fever.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.406
So maybe it wasn't
about protecting us

12:57.508 --> 12:59.375
after a nuclear attack.

12:59.477 --> 13:02.044
Maybe they just wanted
to use it in Afghanistan.

13:04.515 --> 13:06.816
We don't know it's
the same virus we gave them.

13:10.121 --> 13:13.355
It's a hell of a coincidence
if it isn't.

13:22.716 --> 13:25.784

13:47.774 --> 13:50.708
(indistinct conversation)

13:54.214 --> 13:58.215
Gabriel gave me all this
equipment before he left.

13:58.318 --> 14:01.118
To make the reports
for the next few months.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.587
He showed me
how to use it, but...

14:03.690 --> 14:05.122
I can't use it.

14:05.224 --> 14:06.757
It's all right.
I'll tell them.

14:06.859 --> 14:09.360
(elevator bell dings)

14:09.462 --> 14:11.629
Father Victor
was out again

14:11.731 --> 14:13.330
last Tuesday and Wednesday,
very late.

14:13.432 --> 14:16.033
He came back both times
drunk.

14:16.135 --> 14:20.003
I know he's been seeing
the Frenchman.

14:20.105 --> 14:22.105
How much of this
did Gabriel know?

14:22.208 --> 14:25.508
He knew about it,
but it's getting more serious.

14:25.610 --> 14:27.377
His Eminence
the Metropolitan

14:27.479 --> 14:29.446
is listening to Father Victor
more and more.

14:29.548 --> 14:31.214
I've seen them
meeting in private.

14:31.316 --> 14:32.549
I know what you'll think.

14:32.651 --> 14:34.784
That I'm looking out for myself,
my position.

14:34.886 --> 14:36.453
That I'm jealous.

14:36.555 --> 14:38.020
I'm not.

14:38.122 --> 14:39.989
I'm telling you
what's going on

14:40.091 --> 14:42.392
so you can
protect yourselves.

14:43.829 --> 14:46.095
All right.

14:46.197 --> 14:47.596
Thank you.

14:49.667 --> 14:50.699
(clears throat)

14:57.108 --> 14:58.474
Will I see you again,
then?

14:59.477 --> 15:01.677
Only if something urgent
comes up.

15:01.779 --> 15:03.679
Um, the new person
who's coming to work with you

15:03.781 --> 15:05.514
should be here
in two to three months.

15:05.616 --> 15:07.449
Hm.

15:07.551 --> 15:09.485
Sometimes
I hear things--

15:09.587 --> 15:12.053
exactly the things
I was asked to tell you about.

15:12.155 --> 15:14.222
I don't know
if they're urgent.

15:14.358 --> 15:17.359
I used to just
tell Gabriel, and...

15:17.461 --> 15:22.097
Well, he always said
it was very important for him

15:22.199 --> 15:24.065
that we talk them
through.

15:29.239 --> 15:32.874
I'm sorry. I just can't meet
with you on a regular basis.

15:37.079 --> 15:38.345
I understand.

15:39.582 --> 15:40.848
I will pray for you.

15:40.950 --> 15:42.349
(chuckles lightly)
Okay.

15:43.553 --> 15:45.520
You should try it.

15:45.622 --> 15:47.455
I keep hearing that.

15:49.626 --> 15:52.026
It is a great solace.

15:52.128 --> 15:55.095
Especially when you live
this kind of life.

16:07.709 --> 16:09.342
LINH:
How's your son doing?

16:09.445 --> 16:11.745
Good. Thanks for asking.

16:11.847 --> 16:13.847
He's a senior now,
if you can believe it.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.249
- Wow.
- Yeah.

16:17.953 --> 16:20.454
- Ah, thanks.
- Mm. Ah.

16:20.589 --> 16:22.288
Looking at colleges?

16:22.390 --> 16:25.124
Yeah.
With his mom mostly.

16:25.226 --> 16:27.560
You know we're not,
uh...

16:27.662 --> 16:28.794
I know.

16:28.896 --> 16:29.996
Well...

16:30.098 --> 16:31.597
Well, she's in charge
of all that.

16:36.771 --> 16:40.806
W-Well, it's--
it's nice of you to come.

16:40.908 --> 16:44.844
It's been, um, quiet
since the funeral.

16:44.946 --> 16:46.846
Mm.

16:46.948 --> 16:49.849
Have you been...
seeing friends?

16:49.951 --> 16:52.184
Getting support?

16:52.286 --> 16:53.953
Some.

16:56.924 --> 17:01.393
You know, not one of you
from the office has been by.

17:01.495 --> 17:02.961
Or called.

17:04.131 --> 17:06.231
That's awful.

17:07.468 --> 17:09.468
I, uh...

17:11.671 --> 17:14.338
I guess we're not
the best at that.

17:18.011 --> 17:20.744
Now that he was retired,
I thought maybe...

17:26.152 --> 17:27.251
Sorry.

17:27.353 --> 17:29.020
It's okay.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.892
How are things there?

17:34.994 --> 17:37.228
Okay.

17:39.399 --> 17:41.365
You know,
he was a great boss.

17:43.536 --> 17:45.469
I mean, I'm not the easiest guy
to be the boss of.

17:45.571 --> 17:46.570
(chuckles)

17:52.344 --> 17:54.144
(gulps)

17:57.650 --> 18:00.851
Did you just come
to visit?

18:00.986 --> 18:02.285
Well...

18:06.058 --> 18:07.657
I'm sure that,
over the years,

18:07.759 --> 18:13.496
he's told you some things
that you couldn't repeat.

18:16.634 --> 18:17.667
Yes.

18:20.337 --> 18:24.006
We have a better sense now
of what happened in Bangkok.

18:26.143 --> 18:27.509
It <i> was</i> them.

18:31.749 --> 18:35.317
And now I have something
on someone else--

18:35.419 --> 18:37.453
an unrelated case--

18:37.555 --> 18:39.888
but the department
wants me to use it

18:39.990 --> 18:42.424
as a way
to get back at them.

18:42.526 --> 18:45.127
The thing is, this guy,
he didn't do anything.

18:45.229 --> 18:47.296
The opposite.

18:47.398 --> 18:49.531
I don't see
putting him at risk

18:49.633 --> 18:53.401
so we can go after
some other people.

18:53.503 --> 18:56.571
Revenge isn't
that important.

18:56.673 --> 18:59.173
And I don't think
it would be to Frank.

19:05.816 --> 19:07.916
He would want revenge.

19:17.026 --> 19:18.692
(keys rattle)

19:19.462 --> 19:20.794
(door closes)

19:23.366 --> 19:24.565
Hey.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.433
Hi, Henry.

19:26.535 --> 19:28.969
Can I talk to you guys
for a second?

19:31.373 --> 19:33.774
S-Sure.
Everything okay?

19:36.145 --> 19:38.712
Uh...

19:38.814 --> 19:40.881
S-So... you know

19:40.983 --> 19:43.049
how I've been doing really well
at school recently?

19:43.152 --> 19:45.285
We sure do.

19:45.387 --> 19:47.120
My friends
have been, too.

19:47.222 --> 19:49.422
My new friends.
Like Chris.

19:49.525 --> 19:51.291
And she's going to this
great high school next year

19:51.393 --> 19:52.325
called St. Edwards.

19:52.427 --> 19:53.660
It's in New Hampshire.

19:53.762 --> 19:55.128
Her brother's
a junior there.

19:55.230 --> 19:57.096
Her dad went
and her uncle.

19:57.199 --> 19:58.298
Her whole family.

20:00.635 --> 20:02.434
So, is it
a religious school?

20:02.537 --> 20:03.536
No, no.

20:03.638 --> 20:05.638
It's--
It's just called that.

20:08.843 --> 20:10.710
And I want to go there.

20:17.418 --> 20:20.186
It's in--
It's in New Hampshire?

20:20.288 --> 20:21.753
Right,
but it's a boarding school,

20:21.855 --> 20:23.722
so I would live there
during school,

20:23.824 --> 20:26.058
and then I'd come home
vacations.

20:27.061 --> 20:29.061
And when
would this start?

20:29.163 --> 20:30.362
Next fall.

20:30.464 --> 20:33.231
W-- Uh,
what-- what--

20:33.333 --> 20:35.901
what's wrong with--
with the high schools here?

20:36.003 --> 20:38.670
Well, like Paige's--
they're not that serious,

20:38.772 --> 20:40.172
kids mess around,

20:40.273 --> 20:42.273
and it would be hard
to get the teacher's attention.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.942
Well, there are
private schools here.

20:44.044 --> 20:46.178
But, w--
isn't it expensive?

20:46.279 --> 20:49.414
I mean, p-p-private schools
cost a fortune.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.048
Yeah,
but at St. Edwards,

20:51.150 --> 20:53.418
I can probably get
a scholarship.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.355
I sent in
an application.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.523
Already?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.057
Without telling us
about it?!

21:00.159 --> 21:01.392
Okay, look.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.595
It's not like I can go
and not tell you.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.329
You have to, like,
say yes.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.997
Henry, wait. Okay.
Let's just--

21:07.100 --> 21:08.498
Let's slow this all down
for a second.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.835
But it's a great opportunity,
Mom.

21:10.937 --> 21:15.005
Henry, do you not want
to live here?

21:15.108 --> 21:16.673
No, no,
it's not that at all.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.109
It's just that
St. Edwards is great.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.543
Chris told me
all about it,

21:19.645 --> 21:22.178
and her dad wrote
a recommendation for me...

21:23.315 --> 21:25.282
He-- He wrote
a recommendation?

21:25.384 --> 21:28.218
Look,
it's an important school.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.919
Important people
have gone there.

21:30.021 --> 21:32.389
Two senators
and a guy who won a Nobel Prize.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.124
It's really prestigious.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.792
The academics, the sports,
the activities--

21:35.894 --> 21:37.261
they're all right there.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.928
You wouldn't
have to drive me anywhere.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.730
I'd just be there.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.331
The teachers
are your coaches.

21:42.433 --> 21:44.467
You eat dinner with them.
You wear coats and ties.

21:44.569 --> 21:45.735
It's serious.

21:45.837 --> 21:47.403
The students are waiters.

21:47.505 --> 21:49.272
It's a lot
of responsibility.

21:51.309 --> 21:53.609
Here,
here's a brochure.

21:55.012 --> 21:56.845
So... Chris...

21:56.947 --> 21:58.447
Oh, no, no.
It's nothing like that.

21:58.549 --> 22:01.216
She's not my girlfriend.
She's-- She's just a friend.

22:01.319 --> 22:03.919
But you've been spending
a lot of time with her family?

22:04.021 --> 22:07.423
My teacher Mr. Jeffries
thinks it's a great opportunity.

22:07.525 --> 22:10.459
He says that I'm at the most
important developmental stage--

22:10.561 --> 22:11.894
kids my age.

22:13.264 --> 22:15.563
Don't we want
to capitalize on that?

22:19.103 --> 22:20.568
(sighs softly)

22:23.612 --> 22:25.694
_

22:28.512 --> 22:32.246
<i>(men singing in Russian)</i>

22:32.349 --> 22:34.449
(sizzling)

22:55.738 --> 22:57.805
<i>(singing continues)</i>

23:04.779 --> 23:08.014
(knock on door)

23:08.116 --> 23:09.883
Galina?

23:14.056 --> 23:15.222
- (knock on door)
- (music stops)

23:15.223 --> 23:16.725
_

23:22.364 --> 23:23.730
Oh.

23:29.303 --> 23:30.503
Uh...

23:30.605 --> 23:32.338
May I come in
for a moment?

23:32.440 --> 23:33.740
I-I won't stay long.

23:37.345 --> 23:39.245
Thank you.

23:44.952 --> 23:47.186
Oh, I'm interrupting
your dinner.

23:47.288 --> 23:48.587
It's just a snack.

23:48.689 --> 23:50.389
Well, it looks good.

23:53.494 --> 23:55.059
Would you like
something to drink?

23:55.161 --> 23:56.828
Just a glass of water,
please.

23:59.867 --> 24:01.966
(glass clinks)

24:02.068 --> 24:04.335
(water runs)

24:08.074 --> 24:09.507
(water stops)

24:32.097 --> 24:34.231
How's your Russian
coming?

24:36.570 --> 24:37.932
_

24:38.370 --> 24:42.406
Your life will get better
when your Russian improves.

24:46.345 --> 24:47.978
Do my parents know
where I am?

24:48.080 --> 24:49.646
No.

24:49.748 --> 24:52.015
But I spoke to them,
and I told them you were safe.

24:52.117 --> 24:53.716
That you were
being taken care of

24:53.819 --> 24:55.885
by people
who respect you.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.023
Why are you here?

25:03.094 --> 25:04.627
Do you have some news
for me?

25:04.729 --> 25:06.395
No.

25:14.072 --> 25:15.804
Did you came all this way
just to--

25:15.906 --> 25:17.406
No. No.

25:17.508 --> 25:20.009
I'm-- I'm here now.

25:20.111 --> 25:22.811
I-I've retired.

25:22.913 --> 25:24.080
(sighs deeply)

25:24.182 --> 25:26.315
I was done.

25:29.753 --> 25:31.420
Hm.

25:31.522 --> 25:33.989
(sniffs)

25:34.091 --> 25:35.256
Are you married?

25:35.359 --> 25:37.626
No, no. No.
(chuckles)

25:37.728 --> 25:39.361
I never was.

25:41.365 --> 25:44.466
Too difficult
for my work.

25:44.568 --> 25:46.702
I have some family.

25:46.804 --> 25:48.136
Well,
that must be nice.

25:48.238 --> 25:50.938
Well,
we're not close.

25:51.041 --> 25:54.609
But I came
to hear about you.

25:54.711 --> 25:56.444
Tell me,
do you like your teacher?

25:56.546 --> 25:58.279
Galina?

26:00.484 --> 26:03.018
She's nice.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.619
She comes in
every other day.

26:04.721 --> 26:06.453
We talk.

26:06.556 --> 26:08.322
She helps with grammar,
writing...

26:08.424 --> 26:10.424
And who takes care
of everything else?

26:11.861 --> 26:15.195
Volodya...

26:15.297 --> 26:16.797
from your organization.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.966
He makes sure
I have what I need.

26:19.068 --> 26:20.535
You're friends?

26:21.537 --> 26:22.936
No.

26:24.840 --> 26:29.076
Has Volodya
introduced you to people?

26:29.178 --> 26:30.210
A few.

26:30.312 --> 26:31.745
Men.

26:31.847 --> 26:33.713
Nobody suitable.

26:37.553 --> 26:40.987
Well, as soon
as your language improves,

26:41.089 --> 26:43.924
we'll see to it that
we find you a job at a paper

26:44.026 --> 26:46.526
or in publishing,
translating.

26:46.628 --> 26:48.828
Y-You'll meet people.

27:03.244 --> 27:06.679
Clark thinks about you,
Martha.

27:06.781 --> 27:11.016
He wanted to send you a letter,
but it's not allowed.

27:11.118 --> 27:13.151
He's the reason
I talked to your parents.

27:13.253 --> 27:16.088
He insisted.

27:16.190 --> 27:18.557
He wants
what's best for you.

27:24.264 --> 27:25.864
We all do.

27:31.371 --> 27:32.870
What's best for me?

27:41.381 --> 27:44.248
I understand everything now,
Gabriel.

27:47.754 --> 27:49.120
All of it.

28:00.933 --> 28:02.399
You can go.

28:30.162 --> 28:34.464
And please
don't come back again.

28:51.075 --> 28:52.753
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

29:26.867 --> 29:28.934
(walkie-talkie clicks)

29:33.173 --> 29:36.074
(indistinct conversations)

29:52.726 --> 29:55.225
You look at it?

29:55.327 --> 29:57.961
It's-- It's like
an Ivy League college.

29:58.063 --> 29:59.262
It's like a country club.

29:59.364 --> 30:00.563
It's like
a fancy orphanage.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.499
(chuckles)
(cabinet door closes)

30:02.601 --> 30:04.801
If you told me
when I was a kid his age

that I would live
in a house like this...

We have to let him
grow up.

30:16.948 --> 30:19.115
He doesn't have to go away
to grow up.

30:21.386 --> 30:22.619
It might be good for him.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.819
He's doing fine here.

30:23.921 --> 30:25.054
Look at his grades.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.189
I mean,
a place like this--

30:27.291 --> 30:28.858
You think
he's gonna keep wanting

30:28.960 --> 30:30.993
to wear a coat and tie
to dinner every night?

30:31.095 --> 30:34.830
I mean, I'm-- I'm glad
he's doing so well at school,

30:34.932 --> 30:37.232
but he's not the kind of kid--

47:42.007 --> 47:43.506
