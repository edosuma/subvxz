ELEMENTARY #706
"Command: Delete"
Closed Captioned

00:00.209 --> 00:01.543
Previously on Elementary...

00:01.543 --> 00:03.253
If you have a moment,
we'd like to discuss

00:03.253 --> 00:05.255
the matter of your
niece, Mr. Reichenbach.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.965
Well, you can call me Odin,
all my friends do.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.675
I haven't decided if
we're going to be friends.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.302
You sent us on a wild goose
chase, we'd like to know why.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.678
It was a test.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.347
You passed.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.974
Testing our skills is
completely unnecessary.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.476
It wasn't your skills
I was testing.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.102
It was the two of you.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.520
Our friend was shot
and almost killed

00:20.520 --> 00:22.022
and you just admitted
you were behind it.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.483
All I did was tell Patrick

00:24.483 --> 00:26.318
what I'd learned
about Tim Bledsoe.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.445
We speak with murderers
on a regular basis,

00:28.445 --> 00:31.114
Mr. Reichenbach,
do you imagine any of them

00:31.114 --> 00:33.617
convinced us
of their righteousness?

00:33.617 --> 00:35.786
Perhaps you should consider
the possibility that I am not

00:35.786 --> 00:37.746
the kind of man you deal with
on a regular basis.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.378
You remember Wade Allen Haines?

00:44.378 --> 00:46.171
School shooter in Iowa.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.965
All over the news
three years ago.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.466
You never should
have known his name.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.884
No one should know.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.595
He killed 17
of his classmates.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.514
Now, afterwards,
it came out

00:55.514 --> 00:57.975
that he'd been hinting
about it for weeks.

00:57.975 --> 01:01.561
On videos posted
on my platform.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.231
You feel guilty because your
company didn't stop the attack?

01:04.231 --> 01:06.066
No, I-I feel guilty

01:06.066 --> 01:08.277
because I had no idea
it was gonna happen.

01:08.277 --> 01:11.238
I watch the news
every day, soaking it in

01:11.238 --> 01:14.032
and then finally I broke
our Terms of Service.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.076
I dug into the boy's OdkerMail,

01:16.076 --> 01:17.869
his cloud files.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.496
All the signs
had been there.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.415
On my servers.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.917
I decided then and there

01:23.917 --> 01:25.794
this is never gonna
happen again.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.629
And I started looking for
the next shooter...

01:27.629 --> 01:29.172
the same day.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.467
And your search engines,
your e-mail servers,

01:32.467 --> 01:35.262
social media platforms,
they all gather information

01:35.262 --> 01:37.431
from your users to sell
to advertisers.

01:37.431 --> 01:41.643
Tweaking our code to identify
people planning a crime...

01:41.643 --> 01:43.186
wasn't hard at all.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.315
The next question became:

01:46.315 --> 01:47.399
what do you do
with that information?

01:47.399 --> 01:49.693
Tim Bledsoe and the
ferry; that wasn't

01:49.693 --> 01:50.819
the first time
you acted?

01:50.819 --> 01:52.946
There are three girls
living in Tempe

01:52.946 --> 01:54.531
who would have been
drowned by their father.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.491
50 Kentucky
schoolchildren

01:56.491 --> 01:57.909
who would have
gone off a bridge

01:57.909 --> 01:59.870
with their
suicidal bus driver.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.831
An Ohio church
bake sale spared

02:02.831 --> 02:04.374
from a drive-by shooting.

02:04.374 --> 02:08.045
I have saved
hundreds of lives.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.797
But you've turned people like
Patrick Meers into murderers.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.425
You nudge them to take
out potential killers.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.968
Why not just tell
the authorities?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.636
HOLMES:
Oh, he can't do that.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.139
Could never reveal that he
violated his users' privacy.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.726
No, 'cause he'd lose
his business, his fortune.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.728
Possibly his freedom.

02:24.728 --> 02:28.190
What on earth makes you think
that we would ever consider

02:28.190 --> 02:30.525
joining your stable
of executioners?

02:30.525 --> 02:34.738
Well, that's...
That's not what I'm proposing.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.239
Meers was a hammer.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.158
What I need now is a scalpel.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.160
You two understand
the criminal mind.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.954
I need you to help me
refine my system.

02:42.954 --> 02:46.458
Together, we could avert
so many tragedies.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.585
I don't expect an answer
right now,

02:48.585 --> 02:50.045
but sleep on it.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.047
Maybe you'll wake up thinking,

02:52.047 --> 02:54.299
"Might be nice to help prevent
some murders for a change."

02:57.344 --> 02:59.054
Thanks for
coming so fast.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.807
Of course. Anything change
while I was on my way over?

03:01.807 --> 03:03.975
Did Davis call,
tell you where he is?

03:03.975 --> 03:06.019
I am telling you, Marcus,
something is wrong.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.479
Hey.

03:07.479 --> 03:10.065
NYPD looks out for its own;
we're gonna find him.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.109
Medical retirees included.
(chuckles)

03:12.109 --> 03:13.485
When was the last time
you saw him?

03:13.485 --> 03:15.237
Last night.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.031
I was going to bed,
Davis stayed up late

03:18.031 --> 03:20.033
in the garage working
on one of his projects.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.868
When I woke up, he was gone.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.453
Did you call his work?

03:23.453 --> 03:24.871
They said they haven't seen him.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.123
When I tried his cell,

03:26.123 --> 03:27.833
I heard a buzzing
in his gym bag.

03:27.833 --> 03:28.834
It was his phone.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.127
He left it behind.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.837
Last time I talked to him,

03:31.837 --> 03:33.130
he seemed good.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.464
Has he had
any setbacks?

03:34.464 --> 03:36.341
No.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.260
But you know how it is
with PTSD.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.263
Some good days,
some bad.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.348
The last couple weeks,
uh, I don't know.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.100
I guess they were harder.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.518
Work had him stressed,

03:46.518 --> 03:47.727
he was having trouble
sleeping...

03:50.480 --> 03:52.524
Marcus, what if he decided
he couldn't take it anymore?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.069
Are any of his guns missing?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.488
He doesn't have any,
not anymore.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.407
He sold them all when he got
his medical discharge.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.120
You said he was working
in the garage last night.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.329
Would you show me?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.167
He sells this stuff, right?

04:10.167 --> 04:12.210
His new job
doesn't pay much.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.462
And he still has to
see so many doctors

04:13.462 --> 04:15.213
because of his injury.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.466
Some are in-network,
but a lot of 'em aren't.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.093
The bills have
really piled up.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.431
You said Davis sold
all his guns?

04:24.431 --> 04:27.017
After he got shot, he couldn't
stand the sight of 'em.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.810
Hasn't touched one since.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.021
I don't know about that, Carla.

04:31.021 --> 04:34.691
These are parts
to a bolt-action rifle.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.277
Looks like Davis changed
the stock,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.112
mounted a scope.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.697
He was turning it
into a sniper rifle.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.865
I don't see it here.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.993
Thing is, a sniper rifle

04:44.993 --> 04:47.621
isn't the kind of weapon
you use to commit suicide.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.665
It's the kind of thing
you use to kill someone else.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.382
WATSON:
All right.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.344
So, we've got
new phones.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.596
How's it going
in here?
Uh, I'm done.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.807
If Odin Reichenbach's
methods weren't so extreme,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.183
I wouldn't have
had to destroy

05:08.183 --> 05:10.977
all of our electronics
which run Odker software.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.979
And the captain would
not have almost died

05:12.979 --> 05:14.397
from multiple gunshot wounds.
Just so we're clear,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.149
we are not working
with this guy, right?

05:16.149 --> 05:18.109
No.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.029
He may not kill for money,
but he's still a killer.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.531
Good, I thought maybe
you were buying into

05:22.531 --> 05:24.074
his little sales pitch.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.034
Ah, course not.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.286
I mean, in theory,
it's ridiculous

05:28.286 --> 05:31.540
and in practice,
I myself would be dead.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.500
I've seriously considered murder
on at least two occasions.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.085
So, by Odin's standards,

05:35.085 --> 05:37.420
I should have been executed
just in case.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.297
I can't believe he thinks
the best way to prevent crime

05:39.297 --> 05:42.092
is to monitor what people say
and look at on the Internet.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.219
I mean, no one's
on their best behavior online.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.221
I mean, my mother
has threatened people

05:46.221 --> 05:47.931
on restaurant review sites.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.808
So we're agreed
he must be stopped

05:49.808 --> 05:51.476
lest his next victim
be your mother?

05:51.476 --> 05:54.187
But how do
you stop a man

05:54.187 --> 05:55.605
who has enmeshed himself
in the World Wide Web

05:55.605 --> 05:56.690
like a funnel spider?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.024
I don't know.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.901
I think this is too big
for the NYPD.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.487
I agree;
they lack the resources

06:02.487 --> 06:04.614
and the jurisdiction
to take on

06:04.614 --> 06:05.824
a global corporation like Odker.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.325
Which is another
reason we mustn't tell

06:07.325 --> 06:09.286
Marcus or the Captain;
they can't know.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.745
Not yet.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.498
If word gets out, Reichenbach
will know within hours.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.625
I don't want him on the
defensive; he could lash out,

06:15.625 --> 06:17.210
hurt someone else.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.962
Or destroy all trace
of his operation.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.755
So who do we take this to?

06:20.755 --> 06:23.592
I mean, the FBI are not exactly
our friends right now.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.511
The NSA is the only agency
with the technical wherewithal

06:26.511 --> 06:28.430
to untangle this knot.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.931
Agent McNally.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.766
I'm going to go
and see him... alone.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.643
You should help Marcus.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.520
So he doesn't suspect
anything's wrong.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.813
He needs help? Since when?

06:36.813 --> 06:39.524
Uh, since before I did this.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.192
He texted.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.194
He needs help with
his own future crime.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.197
A former ESU sniper
is at large with a rifle.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.994
I'm sorry, I don't know
what Davis would be up to

06:50.994 --> 06:54.080
with that rifle, but
the guy I know is not a killer.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.166
So far, everyone here
has said the same thing.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.751
Davis didn't have
a beef with anyone.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.377
Definitely not anyone here.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.713
The way you said "here,"
did he have an issue

07:01.713 --> 07:03.131
with someone
someplace else?

07:03.131 --> 07:05.467
It's probably nothing,

07:05.467 --> 07:07.552
but I heard him on the phone
with someone last week.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.720
He was pissed.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.555
Said stuff like,
"I cut that footage,

07:10.555 --> 07:12.599
I want my money, you don't
want to mess with me."

07:12.599 --> 07:14.351
I'm confused.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.228
Davis is a video technician;
he doesn't cut footage,

07:17.228 --> 07:19.064
he just keeps
your gear running, right?

07:19.064 --> 07:21.066
Right. He isn't an editor,
but that doesn't mean

07:21.066 --> 07:22.484
he hasn't used our editing bays.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.235
We mostly do commercials here,

07:24.235 --> 07:26.112
but we all have our
little passion projects.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.740
Documentaries, movie
shorts, stuff like that.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.118
I know Davis put in a lot of
time over the last few months.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.703
Do you know what
he was working on?

07:33.703 --> 07:36.289
Whenever I asked him about
it, he got all squirrely.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.374
I didn't push it.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.459
If he was editing
something here,

07:39.459 --> 07:41.586
would he keep the files
on his work computer?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.171
Probably.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.756
Video files are huge,
and I never saw him

07:44.756 --> 07:46.132
lugging around
a portable hard drive.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.634
So...

07:47.634 --> 07:50.095
Only thing...

07:50.095 --> 07:52.806
our computers are
password-protected.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.225
My boss can bypass it,
but he's on a plane right now.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.018
I won't be able
to reach him until noon.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.728
By any chance,
did he make everyone

07:58.728 --> 08:01.189
change their passwords
at set intervals?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.942
Yeah, every 30 days;
it's a pain, why?

08:03.942 --> 08:05.777
Changing passwords too often

08:05.777 --> 08:07.570
can actually
compromise security.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.073
People can't
remember them, so...

08:10.073 --> 08:11.741
they write them down.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.246
You know what, you said these
files would be huge, right?

08:16.246 --> 08:17.789
So...

08:17.789 --> 08:19.833
If we reorder Davis's files

08:19.833 --> 08:21.793
according to size...

08:21.793 --> 08:23.378
BELL:
"Old receipts."

08:23.378 --> 08:25.296
Three terabytes?

08:25.296 --> 08:26.172
That's a little big
for paperwork.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.801
WATSON:
Yeah, let's take a look.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.803
(smacking, woman moaning)

08:31.803 --> 08:34.889
Okay, so now I understand why
he wanted to keep this a secret.

08:34.889 --> 08:35.890
MAN:
Like that?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.727
WOMAN:
Oh, yeah, oh.

08:38.727 --> 08:42.480
Right, that's everything
I have on Odin Reichenbach

08:42.480 --> 08:46.026
and his extrajudicial
killings.
In longhand?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.194
Well, I thought about typing
it out and e-mailing it,

08:48.194 --> 08:49.487
but given the
circumstances...
Yeah.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.406
It's fine, I get it.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.908
Nice penmanship.
He showed
every indication

08:53.908 --> 08:57.287
of expanding his program,
so he needs to be stopped.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.914
Given his area of operations

08:59.914 --> 09:02.292
is essentially
the entire Internet,

09:02.292 --> 09:03.543
I thought the NSA
would be best equipped

09:03.543 --> 09:04.836
to put an end to it.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.755
Then again,
given the state of this office,

09:06.755 --> 09:08.590
perhaps the Agency's
fallen on hard times.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.592
It's just OPSEC.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.968
We're changing
cover offices in a few days.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.094
You know what bugs me
about all this?

09:13.094 --> 09:14.971
I mean, he just came out
and said it.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.181
I mean, he's got to be
pretty damn sure

09:16.181 --> 09:17.932
you can't do anything
about this.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.143
I don't think his confidence
is entirely misplaced.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.770
It's unlikely the NYPD

09:21.770 --> 09:23.354
could touch him.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.149
I thought about giving this
all to a reporter,

09:26.149 --> 09:27.942
but given the fealty
the press has shown

09:27.942 --> 09:30.737
their new media conquerors,
I worried that any report

09:30.737 --> 09:32.280
would be summarily crushed

09:32.280 --> 09:35.617
or spun or just dismissed
as fake news.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.744
So you darkened my door.
The man is using

09:37.744 --> 09:40.955
the Internet to select
American citizens for execution.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.957
If you can find
evidence of that,

09:42.957 --> 09:45.502
perhaps you'll see fit
to bring in the FBI.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.545
All right, I'll run it up
the flagpole,

09:47.545 --> 09:48.838
see if the bosses salute.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.134
Oh, and, Holmes...

09:53.134 --> 09:56.846
if we do run with this...

09:56.846 --> 09:57.972
you're gonna owe us.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.185
JULIANA:
I don't understand.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.896
You think Davis Whitmark
wants to kill me?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.481
BELL: We know he
was angry with you

10:06.481 --> 10:07.899
and we know why.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.651
We searched his computer
and found

10:09.651 --> 10:11.903
a bunch of hard-core
bondage videos he worked on.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.197
The credits at the end
said that he produced them

10:14.197 --> 10:16.407
for your online
porn company.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.452
We also found a
balance sheet...

10:19.452 --> 10:22.789
that said that you stiffed him
on his last batch of videos.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.957
You owe him 50 grand.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.500
Bad news for Davis was

10:25.500 --> 10:27.460
he couldn't exactly
take you to court,

10:27.460 --> 10:30.129
because then these
would come out.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.926
So, that is a scar
from an old bullet wound,

10:34.926 --> 10:37.095
from when he was an ESU cop.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.013
So he wasn't just
producing the videos,

10:39.013 --> 10:40.765
he was also the
leading man.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.726
(sighs)

10:43.726 --> 10:45.770
I did owe Davis 50 grand.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.730
Emphasis on "did."

10:47.730 --> 10:49.566
I'm producing a new kink site,

10:49.566 --> 10:51.442
and I needed the money
to secure my servers.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.027
So I kept delaying his payments.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.904
Eventually he got sick of it.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.030
He threatened you?

10:56.030 --> 10:58.408
Yeah, but not with a bullet.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.368
He said if I didn't pay up,

11:00.368 --> 11:02.203
he'd put the word out
to my other content providers,

11:02.203 --> 11:03.913
tell them
I couldn't be trusted.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.749
So I cut a deal with him.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.209
What kind of deal?

11:08.209 --> 11:10.169
I offered him a share
in my new site.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.754
He took it.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.423
He knew that,
once we were up and running,

11:13.423 --> 11:14.924
he'd get annual payouts
that'll be worth

11:14.924 --> 11:17.135
two, three times
what I owed him.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.178
And he was satisfied with that?

11:19.178 --> 11:21.556
He couldn't sign the papers
fast enough.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.516
He even left me
a voice mail the other day

11:23.516 --> 11:26.811
thanking me.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.188
DAVIS (on phone):
Juliana, hey, it's me.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.440
I got all the paperwork
in the mail,

11:30.440 --> 11:32.066
and-and I just wanted
to let you know

11:32.066 --> 11:34.736
how grateful I am for
making me a part of this.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.571
We'll talk soon.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.991
Davis is smart.

11:39.991 --> 11:43.369
He knows he won't get a cent
if I'm not alive to launch.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.747
So, whoever it is
he's looking to kill,

11:45.747 --> 11:48.041
I guarantee you it isn't me.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.756
(door opens)

11:57.675 --> 11:59.260
(door shuts)

12:01.930 --> 12:03.389
Hey.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.435
Hey!

12:07.435 --> 12:09.228
Anyone home?
Oh!

12:12.982 --> 12:15.652
Tell me you didn't wear that to
your meeting with Agent McNally.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.863
I didn't,
but that would have been good.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.076
You gonna tell me
how it went?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.452
As well as can
be expected.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.287
Which means he'll
get back to us.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.164
In the meantime,
I've turned my attention

12:28.164 --> 12:30.917
to Marcus's missing friend.
Oh, you got the files
I sent you.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.503
The collected cinematic works
of Davis Whitmark,

12:33.503 --> 12:36.589
and the voice mail he left
his would-be partner in porn.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.132
And?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.301
I saw no indication in any of
the films that I've watched

12:40.301 --> 12:42.095
that he was at odds
with a fellow performer,

12:42.095 --> 12:44.597
despite the many thrashings.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.849
Of much more interest to me
was the voice mail.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.102
I think it may contain a clue
as to Mr. Whitmark's

12:49.102 --> 12:51.521
current whereabouts.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.982
(sound of pigeons cooing,
flapping wings)

12:56.401 --> 12:57.986
Are those pigeons?

12:57.986 --> 13:00.571
A densely packed mass
of roosting pigeons,

13:00.571 --> 13:02.115
to be exact.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.366
When I noticed them
in the background,

13:03.366 --> 13:04.993
I transferred the recording
to tape

13:04.993 --> 13:08.121
so I could isolate and amplify
what I was hearing.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.998
Judging by the amount
of wind I had to filter,

13:09.998 --> 13:11.624
I believe that the pigeons were

13:11.624 --> 13:14.002
in a rooftop coop,
and Mr. Whitmark was only

13:14.002 --> 13:16.045
a few feet away
when he placed the call.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.672
So you think he was
on the rooftop scouting

13:17.672 --> 13:19.048
for a sniper nest.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.633
(tape stops)

13:20.633 --> 13:22.719
According to the cell phone data
that Marcus procured,

13:22.719 --> 13:24.429
the call was made
near a cell phone tower

13:24.429 --> 13:26.055
in the East Village.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.099
Happily, there is only
one rooftop coop

13:28.099 --> 13:30.018
in that entire area.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.772
For the record, I've advised
Mr. Whitmark not to talk.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.192
Unfortunately, he doesn't seem
inclined to listen.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.819
How much does Carla know?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.696
She knows what happened today.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.656
We found you
with a sniper rifle.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.451
You hadn't hurt anyone,
surrendered peacefully.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.661
Everything else,
you can tell her yourself.

13:48.661 --> 13:53.124
Those-those videos I made,
those movies,

13:53.124 --> 13:54.625
they were just
for the money.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.128
A guy at the place I work,

13:57.128 --> 13:58.713
he's been editing
for Juliana for years.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.799
And when he told me what
she paid for content, I just...

14:03.509 --> 14:05.553
I love my wife.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.554
I believe you.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.765
I want to help,

14:08.765 --> 14:11.601
but first we got to
talk about today.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.770
What were you doing
up on that roof?

14:13.770 --> 14:16.355
(sighs)

14:16.355 --> 14:18.983
I got a call about a week back.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.235
Number blocked, voice disguised.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.362
Whoever it was,
they'd seen my videos,

14:23.362 --> 14:24.530
they knew it was me
under the mask.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.450
They said that if I didn't
follow orders,

14:27.450 --> 14:29.410
Carla would find out
everything.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.162
I thought they were
gonna ask for money.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.538
Instead,

14:32.538 --> 14:34.373
they gave me the name
of a hotel.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.792
The Warford.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.086
And a room number, 706.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.170
BELL:
The Warford is across the street

14:39.170 --> 14:40.755
from where we found you.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.548
The person who called,
they wanted you to kill

14:42.548 --> 14:44.175
someone who was staying there?

14:44.175 --> 14:45.843
No, see, that's the crazy part.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.804
They just wanted me
to shoot out the windows,

14:47.804 --> 14:50.014
scare whoever was in 706.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.392
Look, I know how that sounds.
Do you?

14:53.392 --> 14:54.977
It sounds like a guy
who doesn't want to cop

14:54.977 --> 14:57.522
to planning to kill someone,
but I'm telling you,

14:57.522 --> 14:59.690
if that's what they wanted,
I would've come to you.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.530
Yes, hello? Hello.
I've got a question

15:05.530 --> 15:06.781
about one of your guests.

15:06.781 --> 15:11.077
I know I haven't
been myself lately,

15:11.077 --> 15:14.455
but come on, I'm no killer.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.085
Who were you supposed to scare?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.712
They didn't say.

15:21.712 --> 15:25.007
They just said they wanted me
up on that roof.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.010
They said there'd be a
disposable phone waiting for me,

15:28.010 --> 15:30.763
and they'd call me
when it was time to shoot.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.099
I was still waiting for their
signal when you showed.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.184
(knock on door)

15:35.184 --> 15:37.353
Do you have a minute?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.441
So, Sherlock called the hotel.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.068
The room Davis was
supposed to shoot at

15:44.068 --> 15:47.238
was rented by a private
security firm: A.S. Safeguard.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.031
He's on with them now.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.618
Uh, Mr. Smith, could you just
say that again, please?

15:52.618 --> 15:55.955
SMITH: I said that my team
reserved that room last week.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.291
We were situating a client
who recently had an attempt

15:58.291 --> 16:00.042
made on his life.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.503
HOLMES: And your men, they would
keep the blinds drawn

16:02.503 --> 16:03.880
and keep the client
away from the windows?

16:03.880 --> 16:06.048
They're ex-military.
That's S.O.P.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.342
If the window were
to be shattered by, um,

16:08.342 --> 16:09.510
a bullet from a sniper's rifle,

16:09.510 --> 16:12.096
perhaps that would
flush them out?

16:12.096 --> 16:14.265
Is that what was going on today
across the street?

16:14.265 --> 16:15.725
The police find a sniper?

16:15.725 --> 16:17.143
Your men noticed?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.853
(scoffs) They didn't like it.
They called to say

16:18.853 --> 16:20.938
that they're moving the client
to a safe house in the Bronx.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.148
So they left.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.317
I need you to call them
right away.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.153
(vibrating)

16:40.875 --> 16:44.587
Yeah, these are my guys.
Gabe and Josh.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.923
And the third victim
is your client?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.302
Yeah, that's Baron Wright.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.553
He's a middleweight boxer.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.513
Was.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.973
BELL: We know.
He was in the news

16:55.973 --> 16:56.974
a few months ago.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.935
There were rumors he was
using steroids.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.603
The state commissioner
was looking into him.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.188
Some of the guys
he beat in the ring

17:02.188 --> 17:04.690
weren't too happy to hear that
he might have been cheating.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.524
They made threats
in the media.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.943
Is that why he hired you?

17:06.943 --> 17:09.111
Sort of.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.072
A couple weeks ago,
Baron came home to find

17:11.072 --> 17:13.199
a guy in a ski mask
in his house.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.659
He was messing with these,

17:14.659 --> 17:15.826
these pills that
Baron was taking,

17:15.826 --> 17:17.870
trying to swap
new ones in for old.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.665
Soon as he saw Baron,
he-he dropped all the pills

17:20.665 --> 17:22.833
and ducked out a window.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.794
The guy was trying
to poison Baron?

17:24.794 --> 17:26.671
Yeah. The thing is that
the Yonkers Police Department--

17:26.671 --> 17:28.506
they tested the pills,
there was nothing toxic.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.591
It was just a sedative.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.426
All it would have done
was put Baron to sleep.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.346
So, are these the pills the
intruder was trying to replace?

17:35.346 --> 17:36.806
Yeah.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.849
Yeah, he had to take
one of those twice a day.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.309
Do you know what for?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.560
Something to do
with his pancreas.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.020
He was ill?

17:43.020 --> 17:45.022
He didn't look it,
but, I mean, who knows?

17:45.022 --> 17:47.733
Maybe that was just
the pills doing their job.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.069
Or maybe his pancreas was fine,
and these are just the steroids

17:50.069 --> 17:52.154
everyone thought he was taking.
No.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.447
The kid swore up and down
that he was clean,

17:53.447 --> 17:55.283
and I believed him.

17:55.283 --> 17:58.536
Hey, you want a second opinion,
check with the Yonkers PD.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.037
I'm sure they asked him a lot
more questions about those pills

18:00.037 --> 18:00.788
than we did.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.960
Okay, so, just got off the phone

18:05.960 --> 18:07.336
with the detective
who caught the burglary

18:07.336 --> 18:09.005
at Baron Wright's residence.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.215
He sent me these.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.719
This is one of Baron's pills.
Apparently it's a treatment

18:14.719 --> 18:16.721
for something called exocrine
pancreatic insufficiency,

18:16.721 --> 18:18.681
or E.P.I.
You familiar?

18:18.681 --> 18:20.349
It's an enzyme deficiency.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.976
People who have it
have a hard time digesting.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.021
Baron got diagnosed
a little over a year ago.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.023
He told the police it was
some cutting-edge treatment

18:27.023 --> 18:28.399
still in trial.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.775
His endocrinologist
got him in.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.320
This, on the other hand,
is one of the pills

18:32.320 --> 18:34.905
the intruder was trying
to plant in Baron's vial.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.032
HOLMES:
The sedative.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.951
Well, obviously,
they look exactly the same.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.952
That might be a good thing...

18:39.952 --> 18:41.954
Baron said these were
in trial, right?

18:41.954 --> 18:44.248
So most people have
no idea what they look like.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.793
But the person who made
this one obviously did.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.880
You think it was somebody
involved in the trial?
WATSON: Could be.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.215
Or it could be someone from
his endocrinologist's office.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.845
Miss Watson, Mr. Holmes,
I'm Tessa.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.473
Dr. Burgess is with a patient,
but he shouldn't be long.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.267
What's that buzzing?
Buzzing?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.935
I don't hear anything.
Well, you're not pregnant.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.228
Your hearing is heightened
when you're pregnant.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.856
Are you pregnant?
You really don't hear that?

19:08.856 --> 19:11.067
Uh, hey, you can't go in there.

19:11.067 --> 19:15.196
Excuse me, sir, sir.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.489
Sir...

19:16.489 --> 19:18.407
(buzzing)

19:20.534 --> 19:22.912
Dr. Burgess, I presume.
What the...?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.497
You shouldn't be in here.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.332
You shouldn't be destroying
your files on Baron Wright.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.042
That is what you're
attempting, isn't it?

19:28.042 --> 19:29.085
Don't just stand there, Tessa,

19:29.085 --> 19:31.545
call security.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.673
I see you cut your hand
recently; that's interesting.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.300
Someone broke into
Baron's house two weeks ago

19:36.300 --> 19:37.385
and cut their hand
on a broken pane of glass

19:37.385 --> 19:38.761
when they were climbing
out the window.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.346
HOLMES:
We'll leave, Dr. Burgess.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.515
You can expect a visit
from our colleagues shortly.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.101
You can also expect
a court order for your DNA.

19:45.101 --> 19:49.188
Did you come here because
you think I broke into his house

19:49.188 --> 19:50.564
or because you think I shot him?

19:50.564 --> 19:51.982
Perhaps you did both.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.609
I didn't.

19:53.609 --> 19:57.113
If you'll let me,
I can prove it.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.532
First of all, I'm sorry.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.535
I've been on edge ever since
I heard what happened to Baron.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.744
When Tessa told me there were

20:03.744 --> 20:05.329
police consultants here
to see me...

20:05.329 --> 20:06.997
Can you prove you
didn't kill him?

20:08.833 --> 20:11.877
I wasn't shredding his file.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.130
I was shredding this.

20:14.130 --> 20:18.968
It's a paper I was
writing about him.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.137
When he first came to see me,
it was for treatment

20:21.137 --> 20:22.346
for a condition
known as exocrine

20:22.346 --> 20:23.973
pancreatic insufficiency.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.975
E.P.I. We're aware.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.186
I couldn't help being struck by
his muscle mass and definition.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.729
Uh, most people

20:30.729 --> 20:32.940
with E.P.I. don't
look like that.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.693
Most people in comic books
don't look like that.

20:35.693 --> 20:40.197
I started thinking his symptoms
and his physique were both due

20:40.197 --> 20:43.159
to an undiagnosed mutation,
uh, something similar

20:43.159 --> 20:46.370
to a condition called
Dunnigan-type lipodystrophy.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.372
That's a mutation
that inhibits the body's ability

20:48.372 --> 20:49.999
to produce fat.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.042
It can damage the liver,

20:52.042 --> 20:54.670
but some athletes seem
to benefit from it.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.339
It makes them
leaner, stronger.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.593
Baron's condition was
even more unique.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.929
There were more beneficial
effects, fewer harmful ones.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.515
I was trying to understand
its mechanism.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.267
I wanted to synthesize it...

21:08.267 --> 21:10.144
HOLMES:
You mean monetize it.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.605
A pill that reduces body fat
but increases muscle growth

21:12.605 --> 21:13.856
would be worth millions.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.566
Possibly billions.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.359
I didn't tell Baron.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.862
I-I didn't even identify him
in my paper,

21:19.862 --> 21:22.156
just called him Patient X.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.450
Unfortunately, my
research required

21:24.450 --> 21:26.452
a constant
supply of blood

21:26.452 --> 21:28.245
and tissue samples.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.997
I lied to Baron.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.541
Told him I needed them
to monitor his condition,

21:32.541 --> 21:35.586
but eventually
he got tired of me sticking him.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.379
He stopped coming in.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.465
Your golden goose flew the coop.
I tried to make do

21:39.465 --> 21:41.091
with what I had,

21:41.091 --> 21:43.469
but eventually
I used up my stockpile.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.679
I needed more samples.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.515
So you made up some pills
that looked like the ones

21:47.515 --> 21:49.808
he was taking and then
you broke into his house.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.519
You were gonna sedate him
and then take

21:51.519 --> 21:53.729
what you needed
while he was unconscious.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.397
He caught me in the act.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.482
(laughs softly)

21:56.482 --> 21:58.526
I ran.

21:58.526 --> 22:01.111
That was the last time
I saw him.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.573
But it's like you said.
He was my golden goose.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.700
I never would have killed him.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.662
Perhaps you identified a family
member with the same mutation.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.789
You worried that Baron would
realize you were the one

22:11.789 --> 22:13.624
trying to poison him,
and so you killed him.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.585
No. There are no family members.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.003
I'm pretty sure
I saw in the news

22:18.003 --> 22:19.004
that he's survived
by his mother.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.007
He was. His adoptive mother.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.718
Baron's parents were
undocumented immigrants.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.888
They died in a car crash
when he was an infant.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.266
Tessa's great with research,

22:30.266 --> 22:33.185
so I asked her to look
for more family.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.104
(laughs softly)
I lied to her, told her

22:35.104 --> 22:38.065
it was about
"refining Baron's treatment."

22:38.065 --> 22:40.067
She couldn't find
a single relative.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.944
Baron was the end of the line.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.533
Look, I'm not the only doctor
he ever saw.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.077
He dealt with digestive problems
his whole life.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.621
Maybe someone else treated him,

22:52.621 --> 22:54.373
figured out the same thing
I did.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.418
Uh, maybe they were able
to synthesize the mutation.

22:57.418 --> 23:01.463
If they did,
Baron would've been expendable.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.008
More than that.
He would have been a liability.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.969
He could have sued them if he
realized what they had done.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.391
(crunches)

23:12.391 --> 23:15.519
I see you've made
yourself at home.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.354
You know,
I don't know what this is,

23:17.354 --> 23:19.189
the spread in the jar
marked "protein."

23:19.189 --> 23:21.233
It's good. It's crunchy.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.776
Usually, when someone calls
and asks to meet me at my home,

23:22.776 --> 23:24.945
they wait outside.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.072
It's bugs, isn't it?

23:29.658 --> 23:30.951
You don't
want me lingering

23:30.951 --> 23:32.745
right in front
of your front door.

23:32.745 --> 23:36.040
Lot of the traffic cameras and
dash cams run on Odker software.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.833
Neither of us wants
Odin Reichenbach

23:37.833 --> 23:39.627
finding out this meeting
is happening.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.212
Your superiors found the
material I gave you interesting?

23:42.212 --> 23:44.757
Well, they found it informative,
thought-provoking.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.759
They didn't find it actionable.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.803
We need a smoking gun
or, ideally, a confession.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.055
I mean, if you'd been able
to record everything,

23:51.055 --> 23:52.806
then we'd have something.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.433
Had I known that Watson and I
were going to meet

23:54.433 --> 23:56.185
with the architect
of multiple murders,

23:56.185 --> 23:57.811
I would have made
the appropriate arrangements.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.397
Set another meeting.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.775
I mean, he's expecting
a response, right?

24:02.775 --> 24:05.527
Draw him out. Get him to talk
about all the people he's killed

24:05.527 --> 24:07.446
in the name of the greater good.
There's zero chance

24:07.446 --> 24:09.406
I'll be able to record
our next meeting.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.866
He'll be on guard.
They will check me for a wire,

24:10.866 --> 24:12.701
confiscate my phone.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.704
So? I mean, there's a reason
you contacted the NSA.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.581
We'll take care
of the recording.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.541
You want to tell me
how the NSA's gonna do that?

24:19.541 --> 24:21.293
Well, a minute ago,
you wouldn't even tell me

24:21.293 --> 24:23.087
if I was eating crickets,
so, no.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.089
There are some things
that need to remain secret,

24:25.089 --> 24:26.882
but, rest assured,
we'll get him on tape

24:26.882 --> 24:28.175
if you can get him talking.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.385
Can you do that?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.889
I still can't believe
my boy is gone.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.558
We're very sorry for your loss.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.143
When those other fighters
started threatening him,

24:38.143 --> 24:39.937
I was afraid.

24:39.937 --> 24:42.606
But I never thought
it would go this far.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.609
Actually, Mrs. Wright,
the two boxers who made threats

24:45.609 --> 24:48.696
against your son provided alibis
and took polygraphs.

24:48.696 --> 24:49.947
Both passed.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.740
WATSON:
We think Baron's death

24:51.740 --> 24:54.493
has more to do
with his medical condition.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.994
That's why we
asked you to bring

24:55.994 --> 24:57.830
his old medical records
when we called.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.707
Is that them?

24:59.707 --> 25:02.209
Well, I'll tell you right now,

25:02.209 --> 25:04.461
there's less here
than should be.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.463
I think some of 'em
might've gone missing

25:06.463 --> 25:08.048
during the break-in.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.050
Ugh, they made a mess.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.468
Somebody broke into your house?

25:11.468 --> 25:14.221
Yesterday.
I'm guessing it was kids.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.473
Real thieves would have figured
out where I hide the jewelry,

25:16.473 --> 25:19.226
or at least managed
to take a TV off the wall.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.645
But they did take some
of Baron's medical records.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.899
A few photo albums and
scrapbooks are missing, too.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.943
I-I called the police, they
said they'd look into it,

25:27.943 --> 25:31.488
but you know. Nothing worth
any money was taken.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.907
Can I ask what was
in the scrapbooks?

25:33.907 --> 25:36.034
Pictures of Baron, mostly.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.412
From when he was a boy.

25:38.412 --> 25:39.830
Why?

25:41.832 --> 25:43.584
No, I appreciate it.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.711
Any new developments,
just give us a call.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.337
All right.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.256
So, do the Newark police
have any idea

25:49.256 --> 25:50.758
who broke
into Mrs. Wright's house?

25:50.758 --> 25:52.718
None.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.387
It's got to be the same person
who killed Baron, right?

25:55.387 --> 25:56.722
Maybe Dr. Burgess
was right.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.141
The killer is one
of Baron's old doctors.

25:59.141 --> 26:00.684
He stole Baron's medical records

26:00.684 --> 26:02.561
so there'd be no link
back to him.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.438
Well, say that's true.
Why would he also want

26:04.438 --> 26:06.398
a bunch of Baron's
childhood photos?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.275
Not a clue.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.742
Hey, you got time for an update
on the Baron Wright case?

26:16.742 --> 26:17.993
Pat on the back.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.244
Pat on the back?

26:19.244 --> 26:20.954
Sounds like you got a break.

26:20.954 --> 26:24.708
You're looking for approval,
so pat on the back.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.085
Well, it turns out, Mrs. Wright
had copies of the pictures

26:27.085 --> 26:29.421
that were in the albums
that got stolen.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.256
She had them scanned
and uploaded to her computer

26:31.256 --> 26:32.800
a few years ago.
I went through 'em

26:32.800 --> 26:34.134
and found these.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.636
Guy on the right

26:35.636 --> 26:37.846
is Baron Wright's
biological father.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.348
We think the others
are Baron's uncles.

26:39.348 --> 26:40.808
Mrs. Wright got these

26:40.808 --> 26:42.893
when she adopted him,
along with some

26:42.893 --> 26:44.812
of his late parents'
other belongings.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.189
Strong-looking guys.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.690
Just like Baron.
We think that's the reason

26:48.690 --> 26:50.400
the originals were stolen.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.569
Explain that?

26:52.569 --> 26:54.446
Say the person who broke
into Mrs. Wright's house

26:54.446 --> 26:56.240
is the guy who killed Baron.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.242
He stole a bunch
of Baron's medical records.

26:58.242 --> 27:01.912
That fits with the idea that one
of his other doctors found a way

27:01.912 --> 27:03.872
to make money
off the mutation he had.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.833
The one that burns fat
and builds muscle.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.794
If that's a mutation
you can buy, I'll take a double.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.506
Assuming you're right, and
some doctor did the burglary,

27:12.506 --> 27:15.175
he stole these so he could track
down new test subjects, right?

27:15.175 --> 27:16.802
Actually, we think he did it
so no one else

27:16.802 --> 27:18.178
could track down
more test subjects.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.972
If we're right, he already got

27:19.972 --> 27:22.266
what he wanted from Baron's
blood and tissue.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.600
He doesn't need more.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.435
Long as no one else
can track down

27:25.435 --> 27:27.396
another member of Baron's
family, he's in the clear.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.565
He'll get his product
on the market first.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.316
Don't tell me we have to wait
for that to happen

27:31.316 --> 27:32.985
before we can arrest somebody.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.362
Joan has a lot of friends
in the medical community.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.155
She's reaching out,
seeing if anyone can point us

27:37.155 --> 27:38.699
in a direction.

27:38.699 --> 27:40.200
We get any hits,
we'll let you know.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.915
I don't know where you got this
coffee from, but it is amazing.

27:46.915 --> 27:50.252
Oh. I didn't realize
you had company.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.045
Watson, this is
my friend Cassina.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.589
She brought us the coffee.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.465
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

27:55.465 --> 27:58.051
Coffee is Cassina's business,
you see.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.970
She travels the world,
identifying, importing,

27:59.970 --> 28:02.681
and then reselling only the
finest, most exotic beans.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.017
The ones that you're
drinking are Vietnamese.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.060
The coffee berries
are fed to weasels,

28:07.060 --> 28:09.479
who then regurgitate
the beans, and the acid

28:09.479 --> 28:12.107
in their stomachs removes the
bean's more bitter properties,

28:12.107 --> 28:15.527
allowing that unique,
chocolaty flavor to emerge.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.821
You know what? This stuff
is so good, I don't care

28:17.821 --> 28:19.698
how much weasel puke is in it.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.034
Hmm. Are you and Marcus
any closer to identifying

28:22.034 --> 28:23.869
any medical expert

28:23.869 --> 28:26.079
who could profit from
Baron Wright's mutation?

28:26.079 --> 28:28.040
No. Why?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.417
I think I might have
identified another,

28:30.417 --> 28:31.877
far simpler way that someone

28:31.877 --> 28:33.045
could have profited
from his death.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.755
Sherlock called me

28:34.755 --> 28:37.299
because he could tell
these were coffee groves.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.551
He wanted me to take a look
and see if I could identify

28:39.551 --> 28:42.179
the foliage and location,
which I did.

28:42.179 --> 28:46.391
These trees are on the slopes of
Volcan Acatenango in Guatemala.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.851
HOLMES: They're an
ultra-rare variety

28:47.851 --> 28:49.728
called Ethiopian Gesha.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.481
CASSINA: Gesha trees
produce incredible beans.

28:52.481 --> 28:53.899
Floral, rich.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.400
But they're hard to grow,

28:55.400 --> 28:57.569
and they only thrive
in certain microclimates.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.363
Now, back when
these pictures were taken,

28:59.363 --> 29:01.114
the trees had
just been planted.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.659
Now they're
at full yield.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.202
If they were ever harvested,

29:05.202 --> 29:07.746
their beans would be
worth over $500 a pound.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.790
A pound?
The grove
you're looking at

29:09.790 --> 29:11.208
would, in theory,

29:11.208 --> 29:13.669
make millions
every year.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.587
I don't understand.
If the beans are so valuable,

29:15.587 --> 29:17.631
then why aren't
they being harvested?

29:17.631 --> 29:20.258
HOLMES: Sad story.
After Cassina confirmed

29:20.258 --> 29:22.886
the grove's location,
I discovered the land

29:22.886 --> 29:25.013
was once owned by a family
by the name of Bautista.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.099
In 2016,

29:27.099 --> 29:28.725
right before they were gonna
bring their beans to market,

29:28.725 --> 29:29.768
an earthquake
destroyed their home,

29:29.768 --> 29:32.437
killed the
whole family.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.439
Their estate went into probate,
and no one

29:34.439 --> 29:36.191
has come forward
to claim it since.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.443
So you think

29:38.443 --> 29:41.238
if Baron had figured this out,
he would have claimed it.

29:41.238 --> 29:44.408
If that's the case, he might not
have been killed by a doctor

29:44.408 --> 29:46.201
but by a fellow heir

29:46.201 --> 29:47.369
who didn't want to share
the family fortune.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.204
The Guatemalan
consulate

29:49.204 --> 29:52.207
has agreed to help us round up
any wayward Bautistas.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.459
They're gonna send someone
to the precinct shortly.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.045
Um, unfortunately, you're gonna
have to go without me.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.006
Why?
Well, our new friend,

29:59.006 --> 30:02.592
with the bow and arrow,
he's agreed to another meeting.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.101
(seabirds chirping)

30:11.101 --> 30:13.228
Mr. Reichenbach.

30:13.228 --> 30:14.730
I trust your security detail

30:14.730 --> 30:16.857
told you I passed
my colonoscopy.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.233
(chuckles)

30:18.233 --> 30:19.901
Clark is thorough, isn't he?

30:19.901 --> 30:22.446
I'm sure you understand
the need for discretion.

30:22.446 --> 30:25.198
It's ironic, isn't it, that
you insist on the very thing

30:25.198 --> 30:27.909
that you seek to deny
your customers: privacy.

30:27.909 --> 30:31.038
You don't sound like a man who's
about to say yes to my offer.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.123
You referenced
some of your

30:33.123 --> 30:35.000
"successes" the other day.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.419
Tragedies averted because
of your intervention.

30:37.419 --> 30:40.255
The details you gave me
were more than enough

30:40.255 --> 30:42.799
to identify some
of those would-be culprits.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.217
How did I do?

30:44.217 --> 30:47.471
You had two notable successes.

30:47.471 --> 30:51.349
The girls in Tempe
and the churchgoers in Ohio.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.976
Their lives were
probably worth the deaths

30:52.976 --> 30:54.936
of two would-be killers,
yes.

30:54.936 --> 30:58.648
But the school bus driver
in Kentucky?

30:58.648 --> 31:02.027
To borrow a term from your tech
company, there were bugs.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.404
Maybe you were looking
at the wrong piece of code.

31:04.404 --> 31:07.157
You said you had a woman killed

31:07.157 --> 31:09.951
because she threatened
to drive her bus off a bridge.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.454
I assume that was Ruthie Deller?

31:12.454 --> 31:14.414
Her execution was disguised
to look like

31:14.414 --> 31:16.249
a home invasion gone wrong.

31:16.249 --> 31:20.337
Rabid dogs aren't "executed,"
they're put down.

31:20.337 --> 31:22.881
Most of Ruthie's online
footprint had been scrubbed,

31:22.881 --> 31:25.092
but I've got some friends who
are very good at unscrubbing.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.344
They found her blog, where
she fantasized about killing

31:27.344 --> 31:29.930
herself and all
of her young passengers.

31:29.930 --> 31:32.349
Exactly. She had to go.

31:32.349 --> 31:35.393
Did she? Over
the last four years,

31:35.393 --> 31:38.146
Ruthie repeated the same
escalating cycle of rage

31:38.146 --> 31:41.733
and suicidal depression online,

31:41.733 --> 31:44.069
always as her birthday
approached.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.071
And then,
when her birthday passed,

31:46.071 --> 31:49.116
her mood always improved,
always.

31:49.116 --> 31:52.035
But you still had her killed
a day before her 53rd birthday.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.746
All those children.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.748
Her life wasn't worth the risk.

31:56.748 --> 32:00.377
Risk implies odds.
Odds imply a lack of certainty.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.254
You started as an engineer.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.256
So assign a number
to your conviction

32:04.256 --> 32:05.549
that Ruthie would have killed.

32:05.549 --> 32:06.800
Give me a percentage.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.427
Call it 80%.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.596
Well,
there's your bug.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.682
At those odds, a fifth of the
people that you've had killed

32:13.682 --> 32:14.975
could have been innocent.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.601
This your way of saying

32:16.601 --> 32:17.769
you're not interested
in helping?

32:17.769 --> 32:19.396
On the contrary.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.273
Watson and I are
very interested.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.485
But it would have to be
on our terms.

32:25.485 --> 32:29.197
We would vet every single case
to 100% certainty

32:29.197 --> 32:30.490
before you did the irrevocable.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.783
What if your
target acts

32:31.783 --> 32:34.995
while you're still vetting?

32:34.995 --> 32:36.997
That could happen, yes.

32:36.997 --> 32:40.292
But your default position
cannot be

32:40.292 --> 32:42.210
"kill away."

32:49.634 --> 32:51.761
All right, fine.

32:53.180 --> 32:56.266
How about this?

32:56.266 --> 33:00.061
Next time I get another 80/20
call, I'll send it your way.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.731
It'll be your decision.

33:02.731 --> 33:05.525
Call it
a trust-building exercise.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.319
How's that sound?

33:07.319 --> 33:10.113
Like a step
in the right direction.

33:20.457 --> 33:23.210
We appreciate you making the
time to come see us, Ms. Duarte.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.045
I'm sure you're busy
at the consulate.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.546
Uh, I brought
you everything

33:26.546 --> 33:29.257
I could find
on the Bautista estate.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.426
Mr. Holmes said he believed
the man whose murder

33:31.426 --> 33:34.137
you've been investigating
was an heir?

33:34.137 --> 33:36.723
We think the person responsible
may have been another heir.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.308
Well, if that's the case,

33:38.308 --> 33:39.893
I'm afraid I won't be
much help to you.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.311
The Guatemalan
government

33:41.311 --> 33:43.563
has been looking for heirs
to the estate for years.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.148
We haven't had any luck.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.986
This man?

33:49.986 --> 33:53.490
The one Mr. Holmes said was
Baron Wright's father?

33:53.490 --> 33:56.660
I can confirm he
was a Bautista.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.495
Lorenzo.

33:58.495 --> 34:00.038
Uh, he grew estranged
from his family

34:00.038 --> 34:02.332
in the late '90s and moved away.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.960
He must have come here,
met his wife, had Baron,

34:04.960 --> 34:07.545
and then died
in that car crash.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.547
Uh, we would require Baron's DNA
to confirm it,

34:09.547 --> 34:12.425
but, yes,
I imagine you're right.

34:14.803 --> 34:19.516
It's sad, but I think
we almost found him last year.

34:19.516 --> 34:20.600
What do you mean?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.560
You'll see in the file.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.189
13 months ago, a medical
researcher from New York

34:26.189 --> 34:27.983
contacted our
probate office

34:27.983 --> 34:30.860
for information
on the Bautistas.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.612
She had a patient
with a rare disorder

34:32.612 --> 34:35.657
and said she'd found an article
in an old medical journal

34:35.657 --> 34:37.450
from our country.

34:37.450 --> 34:40.453
It suggested that members
of the Bautista family

34:40.453 --> 34:42.247
had the same
condition.

34:42.247 --> 34:44.416
Unfortunately,

34:44.416 --> 34:46.584
the researcher said she couldn't
share the patient's name.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.628
HIPAA laws.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.005
But it had
to be Baron,

34:50.005 --> 34:51.589
don't you think?

34:51.589 --> 34:53.466
I-I don't suppose
your people explained

34:53.466 --> 34:56.428
that he might be an heir
to an estate worth millions.

34:56.428 --> 35:00.432
Of course. But she said
she would speak with him.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.977
But he must not have
believed he was a Bautista.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.603
Why else would he not have
contacted us?

35:11.985 --> 35:13.570
I'm pretty sure I know where

35:13.570 --> 35:15.905
to find the other heir
to the Bautista estate.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.450
Say the word, and I'll send
a car for him right now.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.994
You can't arrest him,
assuming it is a him.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.288
If I'm right,
he or she hasn't been born yet.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.213
You remember my colleague
Ms. Watson?

35:32.213 --> 35:33.590
You said on the phone

35:33.590 --> 35:35.759
you had more questions
about Dr. Burgess,

35:35.759 --> 35:38.219
but I don't know
what else I can tell you.

35:38.219 --> 35:41.014
He was at the office
when Baron Wright was killed.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.891
But you weren't.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.602
No. I had terrible morning
sickness. I was out all day.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.062
Why?

35:47.062 --> 35:48.480
Let's cut the crap.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.981
We're not here
to talk about Dr. Burgess.

35:49.981 --> 35:53.485
We're here to give you
a chance to confess

35:53.485 --> 35:54.986
to the murder of Baron Wright.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.280
The sooner you do that,
the better it's gonna be

35:57.280 --> 35:58.948
for you and your baby.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.659
You think I killed Baron?
Seriously?

36:01.659 --> 36:02.619
It's the 21st century.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.037
Pregnant women can do
all sorts of things.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.955
WATSON: Including
go to the gun range.

36:05.955 --> 36:10.043
We spoke to the manager at
the one closest to your house.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.962
He says that you've been there
a lot lately,

36:12.962 --> 36:16.049
practicing with an AR-15
like this one.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.551
Before you started
working for Dr. Burgess,

36:18.551 --> 36:20.220
you were in the Army
for six years, right?

36:20.220 --> 36:21.763
So?

36:21.763 --> 36:23.014
So we're guessing that's where

36:23.014 --> 36:25.558
you got to be so
proficient with firearms.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.602
It's probably also where you
learned about sniper nests,

36:27.602 --> 36:31.064
like the one you scouted for
my friend Davis Whitmark.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.607
WATSON:
We know that Dr. Burgess

36:32.607 --> 36:35.443
was his endocrinologist, too.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.696
He needed regular follow-ups
after losing his adrenal gland

36:38.696 --> 36:41.491
in the line of duty
a few years ago.

36:41.491 --> 36:44.911
Not sure exactly when you saw
one of his bondage videos,

36:44.911 --> 36:47.247
but you did, and you
recognized his scar.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.290
WATSON:
You realized that Baron

36:49.290 --> 36:52.252
was an heir to the Bautista
estate a little over a year ago.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.003
Now, his trainer said
that's around the time

36:54.003 --> 36:55.255
you started dating.

36:55.255 --> 36:57.257
We went on like two dates.

36:57.257 --> 36:58.967
I think it was more than that.

36:58.967 --> 37:01.469
Either way, you made
the most of them.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.472
Dr. Burgess will testify that
he prescribed you hormone pills

37:04.472 --> 37:06.224
to help you get pregnant.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.309
You told him
you were using a sperm donor.

37:08.309 --> 37:10.979
Which, in a way, you were,
because that's all Baron

37:10.979 --> 37:12.522
ever was to you.
Once you reached

37:12.522 --> 37:14.732
your third trimester,
you could be all but assured

37:14.732 --> 37:16.526
your pregnancy would go
the distance.

37:16.526 --> 37:20.029
You had the baby you needed
to claim the Bautista estate.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.574
What you didn't need
was the father.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.867
So you decided
to kill him.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.619
Unlucky for you,
Dr. Burgess broke

37:26.619 --> 37:28.955
into Baron's house
around the same time.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.166
Baron got scared
and went into hiding.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.001
We're guessing he told you
what was going on

37:33.001 --> 37:34.627
because he didn't
want you to worry.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.129
WATSON:
But you did.

37:36.129 --> 37:38.590
Not about him,
but about your plan.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.300
You needed him dead,
and now he was holed up

37:40.300 --> 37:42.886
with a security team
at the Warford Hotel.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.013
BELL:
So you blackmailed Davis.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.931
Got him up on that roof
across the way

37:46.931 --> 37:48.433
to shoot at Baron's window.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.768
We arrested him before
that could happen,

37:50.768 --> 37:52.228
but the commotion was enough

37:52.228 --> 37:53.980
to get him and his guards
on the move.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.648
You followed them and then
you gunned them all down.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.193
WATSON:
All that was left

37:58.193 --> 38:00.445
was to go to his mother's house
and find anything

38:00.445 --> 38:02.322
you could steal
that could help prove

38:02.322 --> 38:04.991
to the Guatemalan government
that he was a Bautista.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.953
I don't feel good. I...

38:08.953 --> 38:10.747
think I need to go
to the hospital.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.041
But first I would
like to point out

38:13.041 --> 38:15.168
that everything you've just said
is circumstantial.

38:15.168 --> 38:17.921
My baby?

38:17.921 --> 38:20.048
He isn't even Baron's.

38:20.048 --> 38:24.260
This is a court order
for a paternity test.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.970
Pretty sure it's gonna
say the opposite.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.848
If it does, that'll be
circumstantial, too.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.768
But I think it's gonna go a
hell of a long way with a jury.

38:36.064 --> 38:38.066
ODIN (over recording): Next time
I get another 80/20 call,

38:38.066 --> 38:41.027
I'll send it your way.
It'll be your decision.

38:41.027 --> 38:44.489
Call it
a trust-building exercise.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.491
We got everything.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.868
And we're gonna start a case.
You need to be patient.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.662
Investigations
of this size

38:50.662 --> 38:52.664
and of someone of this stature,
they take time.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.040
There's nothing more
for you to do.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.587
Well, in that case,
I have one question.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.967
Did you become a member
of Reichenbach's cabal

39:03.967 --> 39:06.219
before I came to see you,
or after?

39:06.219 --> 39:07.470
What do you mean?

39:07.470 --> 39:08.721
The recording.

39:08.721 --> 39:11.140
It couldn't be any clearer.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.684
It was windy that day
on the pier.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.437
I don't care what kind
of covert listening device

39:16.437 --> 39:19.065
the NSA
alleges to have.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.317
The only way you could make
a recording that clear

39:21.317 --> 39:24.696
is with a wire, and I certainly
wasn't wearing one.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.907
I think you've been eating
too much bug paste.

39:27.907 --> 39:31.870
Is the entire NSA in Odin's
pocket, or is it just you?

39:37.041 --> 39:39.168
Come to that, has it?

39:39.168 --> 39:43.047
It was always a matter of time,
wasn't it?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.635
Agreeing to help you
investigate our mutual friend

39:47.635 --> 39:49.554
was his idea.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.057
He thought it'd slow you down,

39:53.057 --> 39:56.686
give him more time to polish
a new recruitment pitch.

39:56.686 --> 39:58.688
I'd be flattered if I was you.

39:58.688 --> 40:01.524
Yeah, well, you're not me,
are you?

40:01.524 --> 40:04.068
I know that, because
I'm not a murderous traitor.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.154
Traitor?

40:06.154 --> 40:07.905
Well, what's a
little murder

40:07.905 --> 40:10.158
if you can stop the next 9/11?

40:10.158 --> 40:13.286
You do see why that would be
of interest to me, don't you?

40:13.286 --> 40:15.079
Well, if you are gonna shoot me,

40:15.079 --> 40:17.624
I'd just ask
that you get on with it.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.045
This isn't for you.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.964
This is.

40:24.964 --> 40:27.342
This is everything
I've put together on you

40:27.342 --> 40:29.636
over the past couple
of years. Open it up.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.721
You'll see a lot
of familiar names.

40:31.721 --> 40:34.474
Captain Thomas Gregson,

40:34.474 --> 40:37.393
his daughter Hannah,
his wife Paige.

40:37.393 --> 40:40.480
Detective Marcus Bell,
his girlfriend Chantal.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.731
Kitty Winter,

40:41.731 --> 40:44.359
her son Archie.

40:44.359 --> 40:47.362
Let's see, there's someone
I'm forgetting, isn't there?

40:47.362 --> 40:48.738
Is there?

40:48.738 --> 40:52.700
Yeah. Dr. Joan Watson.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.786
It'd be a shame if
something happened to her.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.121
Maybe a botched
home invasion

40:57.121 --> 40:59.457
like the one that
killed that bus driver?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.501
Maybe something messier.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.343
Our friend doesn't want
to hurt any of you,

41:10.343 --> 41:11.594
but I think it's important

41:11.594 --> 41:13.846
you realize he could
hurt all of you.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.473
Don't get in his way.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.642
You'll live longer.
More importantly,

41:17.642 --> 41:19.060
so will all of your friends.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.856
(door opens)

41:23.856 --> 41:25.566
WATSON:
Hey. How'd it go

41:25.566 --> 41:27.235
with McNally?

41:29.862 --> 41:31.280
I think you're making a mistake.

41:31.280 --> 41:34.200
I know this guy
better than you do.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.828
In all the ways that matter,
Agent McNally,

41:36.828 --> 41:39.038
I think I know him better.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.207
He's not gonna let this go.

41:41.207 --> 41:44.043
I told you, I don't want him to
let it go, him or his partner.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.088
I want them
to join us.

41:48.589 --> 41:51.634
Right now I'm managing a lawsuit

41:51.634 --> 41:53.886
from five of my competitors
over hardware patents,

41:53.886 --> 41:55.888
I'm battling
the Chinese government's

41:55.888 --> 41:59.559
illegitimate restrictions on
our Asian market search engines,

41:59.559 --> 42:02.395
and I'm fighting two branches
of the U.S. military

42:02.395 --> 42:05.273
about jurisdiction
over land on Mars.

42:06.899 --> 42:09.485
I can handle Sherlock Holmes.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.491
What is it?

42:15.491 --> 42:18.327
The NSA has opened a case.

42:18.327 --> 42:20.913
We're going to have
to be patient.

42:20.913 --> 42:22.623
An investigation
of this size

42:22.623 --> 42:25.293
against someone of this stature
takes time.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.795
So there's nothing more
for us to do.
