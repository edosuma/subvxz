WEBVTT

00:13.931 --> 00:16.392
I call it the
Jayne Payne Weathervane.

00:16.934 --> 00:20.104
'Cause when this baby sells,
Mama's gonna make it rain.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.606
- This looks amazing, Jayner.
- Staged it myself.

00:23.441 --> 00:24.692
You sure did!

00:25.568 --> 00:28.028
Thank you so much for letting us
host the talent show here.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.030
Please, my sellers
were dying to lend it

00:30.030 --> 00:31.699
when they heard
that Tegan and Sara

00:31.699 --> 00:33.993
are headlining the Boathouse's
last talent show.

00:33.993 --> 00:35.619
Last talent show.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.788
I can't even say it
without starting to cry.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.040
But we are
gonna go out in style.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.001
I am bringing
the Juno award winners,

00:42.001 --> 00:43.544
- and you're bringing...
- Land sell cheques.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.462
Right here.

00:45.504 --> 00:49.133
Gosh, Maisy, it must be so cool
working with celebs.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.593
We're just people.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.263
Well, if you want
a chance to meet them,

00:54.263 --> 00:55.848
you could do me
a little favor,

00:55.848 --> 00:57.808
could you pick up Tegan and Sara
from the airport?

00:57.808 --> 01:00.186
You are my favourite person,
after my facialist,

01:00.186 --> 01:02.021
and no one knows the roads
better than you.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.606
I drive all my clients
to their viewings,

01:03.606 --> 01:05.524
rain or shine,
always on time.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.610
That's the promise of Payne.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.695
Payne, promise,
I'm still workshopping it.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.156
Timing is tight,
Teegs and Sara are doing

01:12.156 --> 01:13.783
a 30-minute set, and then,
they're off to Cleveland.

01:13.783 --> 01:15.284
I will not let you down.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.077
Could this be the start
of Jayne Payne,

01:17.077 --> 01:18.496
realtor to the stars?

01:18.496 --> 01:20.372
Can you imagine?

01:20.372 --> 01:23.167
Oh, no,
I need to prep my car.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.252
All of my Aqua Spin bras
are drying in the back seat.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.927
Maisers dummies Jayne,
and she's out of the game. Nice.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.637
Well, I had to
get rid of her

01:34.637 --> 01:36.472
to redo this "Bed, Bath
and Beyond" basic staging.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.224
You're so hot
when you take off the gloves.

01:38.224 --> 01:40.434
We have been so wrapped up
with my mom,

01:40.434 --> 01:42.520
- and your midlife hissy fit.
- Search for purpose.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.522
That I forgot
that we work best as a team,

01:44.522 --> 01:46.148
- towards a common goal.
- Reverse cowgirl.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.775
- My new Boathouse.
- New Boathouse?

01:48.317 --> 01:49.735
But the land sold,
and everyone's coming out

01:49.735 --> 01:51.445
to pick up the cut
of the payout.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.864
Because my mom is
a very persuasive libertarian,

01:53.864 --> 01:56.283
but I will not let her
liber-tear this lake apart.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.078
As soon as they see
an A-list celebrity talent show,

01:59.078 --> 02:01.330
they're gonna be screaming
for a new Boathouse.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.874
The queen is back.
Let me kiss the ring.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.543
Call me queen again.

02:08.087 --> 02:10.214
<i>♪ Got all the love I need ♪</i>

02:10.214 --> 02:12.132
<i>♪ Coming to me closely
asking how you can succeed ♪</i>

02:15.511 --> 02:18.973
Daddy is ready to par-tay.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.766
- Gross.
- No,

02:20.766 --> 02:22.476
sob-watching
three seasons of "Slut Island,"

02:22.476 --> 02:24.687
'cause your ex
left for Paris, is gross.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.313
But that was yesterday me.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.232
Tonight, we rock
asymmetrical mullets,

02:28.232 --> 02:29.942
and we fangirl hard,

02:29.942 --> 02:31.652
and when Riley sees
that we've become besties

02:31.652 --> 02:33.237
with Tegan and Sara,
he's gonna regret everything,

02:33.237 --> 02:34.738
but too late, mate!

02:34.738 --> 02:36.156
I've already found love

02:36.156 --> 02:37.074
with their steamy trainer, Dashiel.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.201
Why do you have Riley's mail?

02:39.702 --> 02:41.245
'Cause he knew
you'd get into it.

02:41.245 --> 02:44.081
That's sus.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.375
You know
that "sports lab" means STDs

02:46.375 --> 02:47.751
or 'roids for gym queens, right?

02:48.377 --> 02:50.212
Is my pee hole
about to spit lava?

02:50.212 --> 02:52.089
- Ew, boundaries, Justin.
- I'm opening it.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.424
Boundaries!

02:54.216 --> 02:55.801
It's illegal to open
someone else's mail.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.596
Well, it's illegal
to keep my pee hole in the dark.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.223
Or wear that much lash
on Daddy/daughter day.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.642
Please, please
stop using "Daddy".

03:04.268 --> 03:07.271
And I have plans today.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.106
Can we rain check, please?

03:09.106 --> 03:10.524
On Tegan and Sara day?

03:10.524 --> 03:12.234
I know, I know, I'm sorry,

03:12.234 --> 03:14.028
but I kind of
asked someone over,

03:14.028 --> 03:16.113
and you would be the best ever
if you left the cabin.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.032
- For an hour.
- Only if you tell me,

03:18.032 --> 03:19.909
does someone's name
rhyme with Shmorrest?

03:20.618 --> 03:22.494
That is none of your schmizniz.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.250
Well,
your schmizniz is here.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.339
- Why is Forrest here?
- 'Cause you're
a teenage horndog.

03:33.339 --> 03:35.674
- I invited Ivy over.
- The one that fired you?

03:35.674 --> 03:37.885
- Right before she kissed me?
- Go off, girl!

03:37.885 --> 03:39.428
You have to help me
get rid of him.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.013
I'll just tell him
that you're exploring

03:41.013 --> 03:42.556
the richness of human sexual
expression. It's beautif...

03:42.556 --> 03:44.391
I'll tell him- I'll talk
to him Just.. just, uhh,

03:44.391 --> 03:45.559
just.. just, just stay here!

03:45.559 --> 03:46.685
In case Ivy shows.
Thank you.

03:46.685 --> 03:47.853
Fine.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.565
- Put it back, Justin!
- I didn't touch it!

03:52.358 --> 03:53.359
I didn't.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.945
Oh, God.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.573
Hey, hey, hey.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.493
- Hello.
- Um,
what are you doing here?

04:02.493 --> 04:05.162
I'm asking this girl
to the drive-in tonight.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.830
Yeah, that sounds
like a text conversation,

04:06.830 --> 04:08.624
you kn... whoa.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.920
And I need
some clean clothes.

04:12.920 --> 04:13.963
- Of course.
- Yeah.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.967
So, Kombuch, what do you say?

04:18.634 --> 04:21.845
You want to eat popcorn,
and make out in the parking lot?

04:22.346 --> 04:23.764
I do like popcorn.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.107
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:33.107 --> 04:34.358
- We'll just be quick.
- Sure.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.609
- Like, one load, though.
- Okay.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.694
Just the whites.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.366
<i>♪ Ah,
whatcha gonna do now... ♪</i>

04:42.366 --> 04:43.951
Let's try this again.
I need more emotion.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.494
What does it mean to you,

04:45.494 --> 04:47.621
what is the meaning
of this song itself?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.123
Let's try it again.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.208
<i>♪ Whatcha gonna do
when I'm gone? ♪</i>

04:51.208 --> 04:53.168
<i>♪ Whatcha gonna do? ♪</i>

04:53.168 --> 04:55.921
<i>♪ Whatcha gonna do
when I'm gone?
Whatcha gon... ♪</i>

04:55.921 --> 04:57.464
What is this?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.882
A serve.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.676
Yeah, we're rehearsing
for tonight.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.012
As a Bee Gees cover band?

05:03.012 --> 05:04.722
Nana will bring
the house down

05:04.722 --> 05:07.016
with Chilliwack's
devastating "Whatcha Gonna Do?"

05:07.016 --> 05:09.018
It's the fundamental questions
that resonate.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.228
It's the Boathouse's
last talent show.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.231
What's better
than a dying woman's last song?

05:17.735 --> 05:21.655
Opal, can I get your advice
on appies for tonight?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.323
- Appies?
- Yeah, your dad thought

05:23.323 --> 05:25.117
it would be a good idea
to have themed bites,

05:25.117 --> 05:27.077
so how about "Vegan Tegan-tots

05:27.077 --> 05:28.662
- and Sara Cream"?
- I'll handle this.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.581
<i>♪ Ooh, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba ♪</i>

05:30.581 --> 05:32.875
Rest your voice, Nana. We need
it fresh and raw for tonight.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.585
Like the oysters
I need to order.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.881
Okay, here's
what's gonna happen.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.632
You are gonna tell Opal
that you are too sick

05:40.632 --> 05:42.885
to perform in tonight's
sad little hairband fantasy.

05:42.885 --> 05:45.596
Oh, it's more prog rock
than metal.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.973
But you can't put
Chilliwack in a box.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.934
Mom, Tegan and Sara are very
important clients of mine

05:50.934 --> 05:52.311
doing me a personal favor.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.896
I cannot have you
embarrassing me.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.440
As you wish.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.736
That was easy.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.404
Maisy, I'm trying to help.

06:02.905 --> 06:05.074
What you're doing
for the lake is wonderful.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.993
You know, when you were a girl,
you would moan

06:07.993 --> 06:10.913
about community soirees
like talent shows.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.248
I thought it was because
you had no real talent

06:13.248 --> 06:14.666
of your own to share.

06:15.959 --> 06:16.877
Hmm.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.088
You've really grown.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.593
Oh, my...

06:26.303 --> 06:28.180
Do you want some snacks?

06:28.180 --> 06:30.641
I made a vegetable tray.
Not that all lesbians
are vegetarians.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.102
I mean,
not that you're even a lesbian,
I would offer you meat,

06:33.102 --> 06:35.979
I mean, if you want meat,
not that kind of meat, I mean,

06:35.979 --> 06:37.606
I could offer you
this hummus I made.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.151
Hey.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.986
Hey.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.364
Sorry, I was just
doin' my laundry.

06:45.364 --> 06:48.575
And you know,
I've decided that I love...

06:48.575 --> 06:50.285
love my old stuff,

06:50.285 --> 06:52.871
so we can go ahead,
and return the new clothes.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.916
But I love the new stuff.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.709
Like, love it.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.878
So maybe, you should try it on
first, see if it fits.

06:59.878 --> 07:03.006
But the old clothes
are super cute, Justin,

07:03.006 --> 07:04.591
and they make me feel snatched.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.510
Oh, I feel you.
I've got this ratty old pair

07:06.510 --> 07:08.345
of overalls
I just can't let go of.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.596
Super tough.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.265
Justin,
can you go check on my load?

07:11.265 --> 07:13.433
- Boundaries.
- Justin.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.726
Relax.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.020
I'll be gentle
with your delicates.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.398
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.608
Oh, and make sure
you separate them.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.278
Yes, I will...

07:25.195 --> 07:26.780
- separate.
- Thank you.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.532
It is important.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.534
It's important.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.828
- He is, like...
- Yeah, I know.

07:32.828 --> 07:33.912
Yeah.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.670
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.590
Uh, sorry, Whoreen,
Maisy said no home brews.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.050
It's just dessert wine.

07:47.050 --> 07:50.345
Oy, I love me
a 90 proof fruity cough syrup.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.306
But I think
we know how Claire gets

07:52.306 --> 07:54.057
- when she gets into it, huh?
- Oh.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.976
Yeah, so...

07:56.643 --> 07:58.729
...Maisy just wants
tonight to be a class act.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.231
Turn around!
Take 'em back!

08:01.231 --> 08:02.065
Thank you.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.277
Hey, babe, you might
wanna light a match

08:05.277 --> 08:07.154
before it gets in the leather.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.865
Maisy asked me
to pick up Tegan and Sara.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.075
So I'm giving the car just,
like, a light lavender misting,

08:12.075 --> 08:14.411
because artists are very
sensitive to smells, so...

08:14.411 --> 08:16.455
Well, then, don't stop
for a burrito on the way.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.040
- Remember, last time...
- Maisy is doing me

08:18.040 --> 08:19.458
this incredible favor,

08:19.458 --> 08:20.709
so everything
has to go perfectly.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.170
She offloaded
a four-hour drive on you.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.671
If anything,
you're doing Maisy the favor.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.048
She's giving me a shot

08:26.048 --> 08:27.674
at the celebrity
real estate game.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.260
If I play this right,

08:30.260 --> 08:32.512
I could have
my very own Bravo franchise.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.640
"Cabin Flip Bitch."

08:36.475 --> 08:38.477
Wait, Jaynie,
if this is your moment...

08:39.478 --> 08:41.688
you can't grab it
with your hands at ten and two.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.274
Hear me out.
I come with, I drive back.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.402
That way, you can work
your magic on Lady Oasis.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.034
Fine. But no talking
to the sisters.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.869
- Zip.
- This has to be super profesh.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.871
Then we should
take my sea plane.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.791
You can't fly it.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.961
Tegan and Sara
don't know that.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.089
Okay.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.469
Yeah, we should drive.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.818
Uh, good hummus.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.820
My mom got Justin,

09:29.820 --> 09:31.947
- like, really into legumes.
- Ooh.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.323
Yeah.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.910
So, uh...

09:39.246 --> 09:40.747
- Okay, so, Ivy...
- I know.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.082
Things have been weird

09:42.082 --> 09:43.583
- since I fired you.
- Kissed me.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.419
Uh, for the record,
I wasn't your boss

09:45.419 --> 09:47.045
when I kissed you,
so not...

09:47.671 --> 09:48.505
not creepy.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.466
But, uh, here.

09:53.677 --> 09:54.845
It's a reference letter.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.598
I may have slightly exaggerated
your tree-planting skills,

09:58.598 --> 10:00.892
but not your commitment
to climate action.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.145
Maybe, it'll help
get another internship.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.523
Ivy, this is so...

10:06.523 --> 10:09.067
And I'm sorry
for kissing you, too.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.486
I should have waited
for enthusiastic consent,

10:11.486 --> 10:13.322
but your non-verbal cues

10:13.322 --> 10:14.948
felt like a green light,
so I just...

10:14.948 --> 10:16.658
No,
they were totally flashing.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.701
Like, "Go."

10:18.285 --> 10:19.619
Like, "Turn right
at the sign.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.288
Or left."

10:21.997 --> 10:23.582
I don't drive yet.

10:23.582 --> 10:26.335
Okay, so maybe,
uh, not sorry then.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.255
Ivy, you know the only reason
I threw the laundry party

10:30.255 --> 10:31.590
was to impress you?

10:31.590 --> 10:33.550
- You were trying to impress me?
- Yeah.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.968
I've been trying
to impress you

10:34.968 --> 10:36.428
since you saved me
in the woods.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.430
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry about that, too.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.931
- For saving me?
- No, no, no,

10:39.931 --> 10:42.309
for getting,
like, weird about NCI.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.143
I...

10:44.936 --> 10:46.772
I applied
for the same internship,

10:46.772 --> 10:48.231
but they straight up
ghosted me.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.152
And here's
this literal queen

10:52.152 --> 10:54.196
with my internship,
so I know she's smart,

10:54.196 --> 10:56.782
and of course,
she's stunning.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.659
And I was just
all up in my head

10:59.659 --> 11:01.286
about running
my first crew,

11:01.286 --> 11:02.871
but I couldn't stop thinking,
girls like that

11:02.871 --> 11:05.540
don't go for sweaty
tree planters like me.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.089
Well...

11:13.673 --> 11:15.175
I don't know, Ivy, I, uh...

11:16.218 --> 11:18.970
I think you'd be surprised
what girls like me go for.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.558
If the non-verbals
are right.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.489
Oh, no, no, no.
That's cool, Mr. Lovejoy.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.449
I never sort my socks.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.368
First, it's Justin.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.036
I'm, like, barely
a decade and a half

11:43.036 --> 11:44.746
older than you,
we're practically the same age.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.458
Second, never, never, ever

11:48.458 --> 11:50.043
say that in front of Billie.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.670
The girl colour sorts
with a label maker.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.756
Okay. Noted.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.843
And thanks for being so cool
about her ditching

11:57.843 --> 11:59.344
- Tegan and Sara Day.
- Oh, yeah.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.929
It's okay, and I owe you

12:00.929 --> 12:02.180
for the next
super exclusive VIP event

12:02.180 --> 12:03.140
that comes to the lake...

12:03.723 --> 12:04.599
never.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.520
- Wonder what's keeping her?
- Whoa!

12:09.062 --> 12:12.065
Forrest. Forrest.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.484
You gorgeous creature.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.070
Choosing the right date look
takes time,

12:17.070 --> 12:20.115
which gives us time
to choose your look.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.325
- Let's go!
- Okay.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.035
See what
we're workin' with here.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.204
- We got a couple of T-shirts.
- I was thinking...

12:26.204 --> 12:27.998
No, no, no,
we're not gonna wear blue.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.376
Um, got whatever
some of this is,

12:31.376 --> 12:33.753
no plaid
'cause we're not into fall,

12:33.753 --> 12:35.130
ratty old sweatpants?

12:35.130 --> 12:36.339
Look, friend,
I am not gonna lie,

12:36.339 --> 12:37.174
this isn't looking good.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.634
I've got some jeans
in the dryer.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.845
- Great. Put those on.
- Okay.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.388
Perfect start,
but I am gonna need you

12:43.388 --> 12:45.140
to put a T-shirt on,

12:45.140 --> 12:46.766
because
I need my full focus.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.689
Thank you so much
for coming.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.149
Are you excited
for the Boathouse's

12:54.149 --> 12:55.484
last talent show?

12:55.484 --> 12:57.110
Oh, we can't wait.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.570
We love "Barracuda".

12:58.570 --> 13:00.155
That's Heart.

13:00.155 --> 13:03.617
This is a different
sister rock duo, Tegan and Sara.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.204
Who owe it all to Sweden's
sibling sensation, Ace of Base.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.831
- Where are the cheques?
- With Captain Crypto
over there.

13:12.501 --> 13:13.627
Oh.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.003
You have them. <i>Halla!</i>

13:16.171 --> 13:19.049
Hey, Teegs, hey, Sara.
How was your flight?

13:19.049 --> 13:21.259
<i>Great,
but our ride's not here.</i>

13:21.259 --> 13:22.093
Oh.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.971
No,
there must be some mistake.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.765
Sit tight,
I will call you right back.

13:26.765 --> 13:27.599
<i>Okay.</i>

13:38.985 --> 13:41.112
- You gonna answer it, babe?
- It's Maisy.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.072
And don't call me babe.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.367
Okay, well, tell her
we got a huge flattie.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.872
Maisy will lose it

13:50.872 --> 13:52.415
if we're late
to pick up Tegan and Sara,

13:52.415 --> 13:53.917
she trusted me.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.586
Okay, well,
maybe she can send Victor.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.420
No.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.095
He'll never make it
with their turnaround!

14:05.095 --> 14:07.055
I have to just pretend
we're in a dead zone.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.684
You have to
fix this, Wayne.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.853
This was my shot.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.648
I mean, that's why
she sent me to pick them up.

14:16.648 --> 14:19.234
She believes in me.
It's why she's so hard on me.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.654
Yeah, or because
she's Tie Domi in yoga pants.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.032
- Victor has a type.
- That's it.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.035
- Uh-oh, babe.
- Don't call me that.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.997
Don't you normally,
keep a spare?

14:33.498 --> 14:36.334
No!

14:38.253 --> 14:39.796
Hey, all right,

14:39.796 --> 14:41.548
Forrest and I
have found a date night lewk

14:41.548 --> 14:43.800
that pays homage
to Forrest's tree planter roots,

14:43.800 --> 14:46.303
but also feels young
and super hot-forward.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.430
- What do you think?
- Hot.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.349
- Damn.
- So...

14:51.349 --> 14:54.227
did you finish
with the hummus?

14:55.353 --> 14:58.023
No, there's this new spice

14:58.023 --> 14:59.774
that makes me want
to keep eating it.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.776
That's the jalapeno... oh.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.237
- 'Cause it's a...
- Mmm, mmm,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.906
so can you go put
the hummus in my room,

15:06.906 --> 15:09.242
and I'll pack up
the laundry?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.785
- Not the fridge?
- Uh, my room...

15:10.785 --> 15:11.911
- Cooler?
- Fridge.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.914
So if you could go do that?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.125
- Justin.
- I mean, you could
also try the hummus

15:17.125 --> 15:19.294
in the laundry room.
They'd probably,
go well together.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.880
- Oh, my God, Justin! Go. Go.
- Fine. I'm... I'm going.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.550
- Missed you.
- Oh. That's too bad.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.886
Um, because there's
something I want to...

15:27.886 --> 15:30.013
- talk about?
- Do you really wanna talk?

15:30.013 --> 15:31.181
Well...

15:39.606 --> 15:41.066
Take this off,
it's summer!

15:41.066 --> 15:42.567
It's hot.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.028
No, no, I...
Tegan, I totally understand.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.198
I... I'm...
I'm so, so sorry.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.619
Tegan and Sara aren't coming.
Jayne never showed up.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.287
Neither did Opal's oysters.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.164
He's on the phone
with Prince Edward Island now.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.084
Look, your mom
really wants to sing.

15:59.084 --> 16:02.671
I promised Canadian twin icons,
not The Devil Wears Jumpsuit.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.464
We're just gonna have to
call the whole thing off.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.926
- I'll strip.
- No, no!

16:07.926 --> 16:10.136
- Whoreen has a weak heart.
- Hmm.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.223
Oh, maybe, you can ask Billie
to sing Tegan and Sara hits.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.475
She did win the talent show
competition last year.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.811
People are expecting
A-list indie darlings,

16:17.811 --> 16:18.853
not an open mic.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.146
It's a talent show.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.023
It's a chance
for the lake to showcase

16:22.023 --> 16:24.317
- its underappreciated talent.
- No Magic Mike.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.193
No.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.987
Fine, I'll text Billie,
but in the meantime,

16:27.987 --> 16:28.905
we have to stall.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.825
Remember when they stalled
the MuchMusic Video Awards

16:31.825 --> 16:33.618
when Strombo got caught
in the Timmy Ho's bathroom

16:33.618 --> 16:34.786
for three hours?

16:34.786 --> 16:36.538
Yeah, we held
a silent auction.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.790
You almost bet the house
on Grimes's elf ears.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.959
I would've looked dope
in those.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.337
Jayne's staging.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.716
Where did you say Opal is?

16:47.716 --> 16:49.467
And for our next item...

16:52.470 --> 16:54.764
...a relic from
the Boathouse canteen.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.850
Can I get
an opening bid of $200

16:56.850 --> 16:59.436
for this dark hole
of nihilism?

16:59.436 --> 17:01.855
Is that 200?
Can I get 220?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.065
How is he getting
these prices?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.151
He was headhunted by Sotheby's
in the fourth grade.

17:06.151 --> 17:08.445
- Oh.
- Here we go,
it's a bet, there it is.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.830
Hummus is in your room
listening to music.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.248
Did you get rid of laundry?

17:20.248 --> 17:22.375
I tried, Justin,
but he's so cute!

17:22.375 --> 17:23.835
I can't choose.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.378
Billie, why don't you just
date both?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.297
'Cause I'm not like you
that way.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.673
Well,
I think after today,

17:28.673 --> 17:30.091
you're exactly like me
like that.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.760
Hey.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.344
- Can I use the washroom?
- Shit!

17:33.344 --> 17:34.929
Did you hear that?

17:34.929 --> 17:36.514
- It's just me, I'm just...
- Mmm!

17:36.514 --> 17:37.974
...me, I'm just choking!

17:38.516 --> 17:40.018
You, Ivy, me, Forrest.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.728
Billie?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.313
You know,
I will be right there.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.232
- Right through here.
- Okay. Cool.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.318
- Thank you, Mr. Lovejoy.
- No, it's Justin!

17:49.611 --> 17:50.987
- This is...
- Bad!

17:50.987 --> 17:52.697
I've escaped
stickier threesomes.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.532
We're just gonna tell him
you've been brainwashed,

17:54.532 --> 17:56.659
- and you're in a cult.
- Fourteen missed calls
from Maisy?

17:56.659 --> 17:58.703
I think I could pass
as a cult leader.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.622
- I'm charismatic,
I thrive in chaos...
- Wait, wait, wait.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.373
Tegan and Sara never showed.
Maisy needs me to sing.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.209
My baby,
filling in for Canada's

18:04.209 --> 18:05.960
queer pop power duo?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.754
- Gagged.
- I mean, I have to go, right?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.339
I mean,
it is the last talent show.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.090
Yeah, as much as
I want to see my girl

18:11.090 --> 18:12.634
take the spotlight
and Kris Jenner all the credit,

18:12.634 --> 18:15.094
I know where I'm needed,
so you go, you go now!

18:15.094 --> 18:18.097
You run, Billie! Run!

18:20.975 --> 18:23.019
What are you doing?
I already called the tow truck.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.064
Emergency kit
has a tire inflator.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.524
Maybe,
we can still make it.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.108
Don't bother.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.069
I should have just told Maisy
when I had the chance.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.237
Now, she'll never forgive me.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.031
Blame me.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.617
She already thinks
that I'm a blown tire.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.577
Oh, Wayne, that's...

18:40.203 --> 18:41.246
that's so...

18:42.705 --> 18:43.540
thank you.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.960
You tried your best, Jaynie.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.169
You always try your best.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.588
And you know what?
Whatever Maisy says,

18:50.588 --> 18:53.132
not your fault.
Sometimes shit just happens.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.138
And sometimes,
shit happens on purpose.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.640
You run over
a box of nails?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.518
In perfect line,
and my spare tire goes missing?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.938
Someone didn't want us
to get to the airport.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.940
No. Makes no sense.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.150
Who wouldn't want
to see Tegan and Sara?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.611
"Everything is Awesome"?

19:13.611 --> 19:14.779
That song still slaps!

19:15.321 --> 19:17.073
I love the Lego movie,

19:17.073 --> 19:19.325
- Jaynie, you know that.
- No, I do. I do know that.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.833
I'm turning into Justin.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.044
Who am I kidding?
I can't run 12 kilometers.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.214
- Right here.
- How about $500?

19:33.214 --> 19:34.716
500 from Claire!

19:35.300 --> 19:36.926
Oh, wow.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.554
Billie can't make it.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.848
I think we're gonna have to
cancel the whole thing.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.852
No, this is your talent show.
There's only one way to save it.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.771
Oh, fine.
Mom, go ahead.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.357
Do your prog rock fantasy
for the swamp people.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.860
I'll duo you one better.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.987
- Sold! To Claire.
- Oh, dear.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.031
Yeah!

20:08.958 --> 20:10.293
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.212
So you left out
a tiny detail, did ya?

20:14.047 --> 20:16.633
Like a fool,
I was trying to open your eyes

20:16.633 --> 20:18.009
to the joys of polyamory,

20:18.009 --> 20:20.553
but I draw
the line at incest.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.846
Okay,
we had no idea,

20:21.846 --> 20:23.222
- Mr. Lovejoy...
- It's Justin!

20:25.016 --> 20:27.268
Now, as much as it ages me
to be the parent...

20:27.977 --> 20:29.729
you got's to
clean up your mess.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.522
I know,
that's why I came back, I...

20:32.440 --> 20:34.067
I didn't want
to pull a Justin.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.611
Oh, well...

20:37.362 --> 20:39.572
I'm glad that my trauma
and my name

20:39.572 --> 20:40.823
could be a teachable moment.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.911
Now, because your drama
is about to get hella awkward

20:44.911 --> 20:47.580
in about two seconds,
I will humbly excuse myself

20:47.580 --> 20:49.582
to go fill in
for Tegan and Sara.

20:52.627 --> 20:53.586
Good luck.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.713
- Serious, Billie?
- What the fuck, Billie?

20:55.713 --> 20:57.548
I wasn't trying to play games.
Honest, you guys.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.425
But what
was I supposed to do?

20:59.425 --> 21:01.511
First, my boss's brother
kisses me, and then,
my boss kisses me?

21:01.511 --> 21:03.346
Oh, she was not your boss
when she kissed you,

21:03.346 --> 21:05.139
and she asked
if you were into her brother.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.391
Easy, Ive,
it's not Billie's fault

21:06.391 --> 21:08.267
- she's our type.
- Get a new type!

21:08.267 --> 21:10.311
This can't keep happening.
First, Maya,
and then there was...

21:10.311 --> 21:11.562
That was grade six.

21:11.562 --> 21:12.730
Okay, I don't even know

21:12.730 --> 21:14.148
if Forrest and I
are a thing yet.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.441
- Like, you know...
- The shed

21:15.441 --> 21:16.818
- was definitely a thing.
- Oh, God.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.486
Yes, it kinda was,
no, and then, Ivy,

21:18.486 --> 21:20.363
you kissed me
at the laundry party,

21:20.363 --> 21:22.615
and I don't know, I just...
I just got so confused,
you know?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.534
- Well, we are irresistible.
- This is not cool, Billie.

21:24.534 --> 21:25.702
You can't play both of us.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.248
Yeah, you're right.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.210
Maybe you should go.

21:48.057 --> 21:48.891
We cool?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.311
Yeah. So cool.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.897
Cool.

21:56.524 --> 21:59.193
And, next up,
we have the original

21:59.193 --> 22:01.696
hand-stitched
Boathouse secretary's cushion.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.698
This Warholian throwback,

22:03.698 --> 22:06.743
dripping in irony,
is starting at $500,
$500, everyone!

22:06.743 --> 22:08.619
We want Tegan and Sara!

22:08.619 --> 22:10.371
Anyone?
Get off the stage!

22:10.371 --> 22:13.458
Tegan, Sara!
Tegan, Sara! Tegan, Sara!

22:13.458 --> 22:15.376
- Get off, Dad.
- Tegan, Sara!

22:15.376 --> 22:19.380
Tegan, Sara! Tegan, Sara!

22:19.380 --> 22:23.551
Tegan, Sara!
Tegan, Sara!

22:23.551 --> 22:25.553
Tegan, Sara!

23:47.969 --> 23:49.512
Total BDE.

23:49.512 --> 23:51.681
Anyone seen
the sex falcon?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.350
Uh, <i>halla.</i>

23:54.350 --> 23:58.062
Um, I would like
to thank Maisy for reminding us

23:58.062 --> 24:00.523
how the lake
needs a place to gather,

24:00.523 --> 24:03.693
and enjoy our
sad little talents together.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.362
I would like
to pledge my portion

24:06.362 --> 24:08.573
of the land sale
to find a home

24:08.573 --> 24:10.491
for the new Boathouse.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.494
Count us in!
Anything for Heart.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.247
Maybe,
we talk about this at home?

24:16.247 --> 24:18.124
Take my money, I'm in, yeah.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.210
Wow! Looks like you got
your Boathouse back.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.421
And we passed for twinsies.

24:24.005 --> 24:25.047
Ooh.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.475
Did my performance
move you to tears?

24:36.475 --> 24:37.393
I didn't see it.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.148
Can only deal with one thing
I love dying in front of me.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.404
Riley's blood tests.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.407
Got low T-cells...

24:52.783 --> 24:54.243
which we know
from <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>

24:54.243 --> 24:55.161
means cancer.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.916
And that's why he told Billie
to hide this letter from me,

24:59.916 --> 25:01.959
and it's all making sense now,
why he proposed,

25:01.959 --> 25:03.753
'cause he felt
like he was running out of time,

25:03.753 --> 25:05.546
and I feel
like this idiot.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.465
These are
my mom's test results.

25:07.465 --> 25:10.218
I had them sent to Riley,
so she wouldn't intercept them.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.345
Oh, thank God!

25:13.971 --> 25:15.473
Oh, holy shit.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.228
Oh, my God, Maisy.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.191
I mean... this is...

25:25.191 --> 25:27.443
we already knew this, right?
I... this isn't...

25:27.985 --> 25:29.654
and it means
Mimsy wasn't lying.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.199
Do you need a hug?
I mean, I...

25:33.199 --> 25:34.992
I know that's not something
that either of us want,

25:34.992 --> 25:37.745
you know, given your bones
are so brittle

25:37.745 --> 25:38.996
and avian-like, but...

25:39.997 --> 25:41.374
I could do that for you,

25:41.374 --> 25:42.917
- if you wanted me to...
- I don't.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.293
Oh.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.711
Oh,
I have to answer this.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.004
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.382
You take it, good...
good call.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.802
Hey!

25:52.802 --> 25:54.762
<i>Hey, we just
saw your post, girl,</i>

25:54.762 --> 25:56.430
<i>so cringe, it's genius.</i>

25:56.430 --> 25:58.015
<i>I mean, we're
at half a million views already.</i>

25:58.015 --> 25:59.267
<i>You really
are the best, Maisy.</i>

25:59.267 --> 26:02.228
No, you are.
And you are.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.479
<i>Okay, never again, though.</i>

26:03.479 --> 26:05.189
Oh. Oh.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.530
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:13.698 --> 26:16.450
So?
Sophie make a choice?

26:16.951 --> 26:19.078
She did
and, just like the movie,

26:19.078 --> 26:21.998
- she went with the boy.
- Oh, damn!

26:21.998 --> 26:23.791
I was really hoping
you'd taste the rainbow,

26:23.791 --> 26:25.918
but I can totally see
why you'd want a little less

26:25.918 --> 26:27.962
drama-llama-ding-dong
in your life.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.630
You wouldn't know it
after today.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.758
Ivy was big mad.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.427
And I feel
like a garbage human.

26:34.969 --> 26:35.970
Can't blame her.

26:36.887 --> 26:37.888
Hard to give up.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.143
So, how'd it go
at Maisy's?

26:42.143 --> 26:45.855
Oh, Maisy rallied the lake.
Everybody wants a Boathouse.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.940
Mimsy's really dying.
Maisy wins...

26:48.607 --> 26:51.110
- again.
- What about your pee hole?

26:52.611 --> 26:55.072
Don't even.
I know you stole it.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.700
They were Mimsy's
test results.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.036
But there was
a hot second there,

27:00.036 --> 27:01.620
before Maisy
came out to tell me,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.456
where I legit thought
that Riley was dying.

27:04.498 --> 27:05.750
Told you not to open it.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.169
The thought of losing
him is...

27:10.254 --> 27:11.505
I really love him.

27:13.591 --> 27:15.468
I'm getting too old for drama.

27:15.468 --> 27:19.055
Oh, I hope not,
because there's still more.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.141
My parents are coming
to take my Parks Canada tour.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.019
What Parks Canada tour?

27:25.561 --> 27:26.812
Exactly.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.690
Oh, I feel sick.
