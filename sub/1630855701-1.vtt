00:46.041 --> 00:51.750
KHOM
OH SHIT…

00:59.291 --> 01:01.541
A DRONE FLIES TOWARDS HER BALCONY.
CUT TO KHOM, WHO'S PANICKING.

01:01.625 --> 01:02.500
KHOM
OH SHIT…

01:02.583 --> 01:03.791
<i>Shit, indeed.</i>

01:04.958 --> 01:05.875
<i>Damn it.</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:08.750
<i>I'm so out of ideas.</i>

01:22.833 --> 01:23.458
KHOM
OH SHIT…

01:28.208 --> 01:29.250
KHOM
OH SHIT…

01:30.041 --> 01:30.916
<i>Damn!</i>

01:31.875 --> 01:33.541
<i>You have been staring for days now.</i>

01:34.083 --> 01:35.916
<i>Your life can't end like this, Diew.</i>

01:50.041 --> 01:50.833
<i>Hey!</i>

01:53.000 --> 01:53.791
<i>Hey!</i>

01:54.291 --> 01:55.500
<i>That's it.</i>

01:55.583 --> 01:57.250
<i>Oh, great!</i>

01:57.333 --> 01:58.875
<i>This will be awesome.</i>

01:59.416 --> 02:00.916
Are you Pawinee's family?

02:01.000 --> 02:01.791
Yes.

02:01.875 --> 02:02.583
Right.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.916
The patient needs medication.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.125
Bring this to pay at the cashier

02:08.208 --> 02:09.916
and get the medicine at the pharmacy,

02:10.000 --> 02:11.250
then bring it back here.

02:12.875 --> 02:13.666
You got that?

02:13.750 --> 02:14.750
Yes.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.750
-Just wait here a while.
-Okay.

02:25.458 --> 02:27.125
<i>Dr. Prakit Jongwilai,</i>

02:27.208 --> 02:29.208
<i>please come to the ER.</i>

02:29.291 --> 02:30.208
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:56.083 --> 02:56.833
<i>Yes…</i>

02:57.750 --> 02:58.875
How much?

03:01.750 --> 03:02.708
Here.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.083
Thank you.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.583
<i>My mom was admitted</i>
<i>to the ICU three days ago</i>

03:10.666 --> 03:12.208
<i>because of her heart condition.</i>

03:14.208 --> 03:16.708
<i>It's so bad that</i>
<i>she needs a ventilator this time.</i>

03:18.125 --> 03:20.083
<i>The doctor told me to be prepared</i>

03:22.083 --> 03:24.541
<i>for the fact that she might not</i>
<i>make it to the new year.</i>

03:37.083 --> 03:38.708
<i>My mom is very old now,</i>

03:42.875 --> 03:44.375
<i>and she has many health conditions.</i>

03:46.000 --> 03:47.541
<i>I just want her to know that</i>

03:48.250 --> 03:49.500
<i>if she still wants to fight,</i>

03:50.791 --> 03:51.791
<i>I will also fight with…</i>

03:52.916 --> 03:53.791
<i>Shit!</i>

03:54.541 --> 03:56.250
<i>I forgot the idea I came up with.</i>

04:31.833 --> 04:32.708
<i>Here it is.</i>

04:35.666 --> 04:36.666
<i>It's coming.</i>

04:37.458 --> 04:38.208
<i>Coming…</i>

04:57.875 --> 04:59.041
<i>That's what she's gonna do?</i>

05:00.000 --> 05:01.166
<i>What the hell?</i>

05:11.125 --> 05:12.083
<i>Forgot again.</i>

05:16.708 --> 05:17.708
<i>Come on, script.</i>

05:19.125 --> 05:19.958
<i>Ideas… come to me!</i>

05:21.166 --> 05:21.875
<i>Ideas… come to me!</i>

05:22.708 --> 05:23.375
<i>Ideas…</i>

05:27.458 --> 05:28.666
<i>Damn it.</i>

05:28.750 --> 05:29.708
<i>Ideas didn't come,</i>

05:29.791 --> 05:31.291
<i>but chaos did.</i>

05:37.791 --> 05:38.875
You won't take it?

05:39.541 --> 05:42.000
No sound alerts are allowed
in front of the ICU.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.375
Don't you know anything?

05:44.458 --> 05:45.666
I'm sorry.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.166
Did you switch yours to silent mode?

05:51.541 --> 05:52.416
Yes.

05:53.416 --> 05:54.750
Do you have a phone?

05:55.666 --> 05:57.250
Switch them all to silent mode.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.250
You talked so loud earlier. Watch that.

06:00.916 --> 06:03.125
You have a phone?
Switch it to silent mode.

06:04.791 --> 06:05.791
Quick.

06:08.791 --> 06:10.791
<i>I know you never write scripts</i>
<i>for love stories.</i>

06:10.875 --> 06:12.500
<i>But Tui has a faith in you.</i>

06:12.583 --> 06:13.916
<i>-It's okay if it takes a while.</i>
-Yes.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.125
<i>He is looking forward to reading it.</i>

06:15.208 --> 06:16.125
Yes.

06:16.625 --> 06:17.333
I…

06:17.416 --> 06:19.458
-Please tell him I'm sorry.
<i>-Okay.</i>

06:19.541 --> 06:20.583
Yes.

06:20.666 --> 06:21.958
I'll send you the script soon.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.166
<i>All right. Keep it up.</i>

06:23.250 --> 06:24.916
Yes, thank you.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.166
<i>Writing a romantic comedy</i>
<i>in a depressing atmosphere…</i>

06:54.250 --> 06:55.333
<i>How is that gonna work?</i>

07:09.958 --> 07:11.791
MANTRAS

07:11.875 --> 07:13.458
<i>She is religious?</i>

07:20.916 --> 07:23.541
<i>I have seen people praying</i>
<i>for their relatives.</i>

07:24.125 --> 07:26.583
<i>To be honest, I'm not sure if that works.</i>

07:36.125 --> 07:38.375
<i>Come on, just leave her alone.</i>

07:38.458 --> 07:40.125
<i>Keep writing. Keep writing. Keep writing.</i>

07:44.708 --> 07:47.041
<i>Then Khom made a precise decision.</i>

07:49.000 --> 07:50.625
<i>He called his best friend, Golf.</i>

07:53.083 --> 07:54.958
<i>He told him firmly…</i>

08:01.791 --> 08:02.916
Ah, shit!

08:09.250 --> 08:11.000
<i>Why are you chanting along with her?</i>

08:24.375 --> 08:26.875
<i>Damn, this isn't the time for hiccups.</i>

08:31.625 --> 08:34.041
<i>Stop. Stop it now.</i>

08:49.708 --> 08:51.208
Oh shit!

08:59.375 --> 09:00.416
There!

09:00.500 --> 09:01.708
That always works.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.458
Oh?

09:11.750 --> 09:13.250
Who made that loud noise?

09:18.333 --> 09:20.750
<i>My piano student always gets the hiccups.</i>

09:21.375 --> 09:23.708
That's why I know how to fix it.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.041
Hey, you told me earlier

09:29.125 --> 09:31.416
about writing a romantic comedy script

09:31.500 --> 09:32.791
that gathers several stories in one movie.

09:32.875 --> 09:36.208
When you pitched the idea, how did you
come up with it? Was it difficult?

09:36.291 --> 09:39.000
You'd have to cast many actors
who are suitable for the roles, right?

09:39.083 --> 09:41.083
<i>Which one should I answer first?</i>

09:41.166 --> 09:42.250
And when you think of punchlines,

09:42.333 --> 09:44.666
how do you know which ones work
and which don't?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.666
<i>Damn… she changes questions so quickly.</i>

09:47.458 --> 09:49.583
And the script
you are thinking of, is it fun?

09:50.250 --> 09:51.458
Can I read it?

09:52.083 --> 09:53.166
<i>Is that a good idea?</i>

09:55.458 --> 09:59.166
<i>How can I say no when she is</i>
<i>fluttering her cute eyelashes?</i>

10:00.083 --> 10:00.875
Yeah.

10:03.000 --> 10:03.666
You can.

10:06.166 --> 10:10.458
HAPPY ENDING

10:18.958 --> 10:20.750
-Hey.
-Are you finished?

10:21.250 --> 10:22.916
No, I'm too lazy now.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.333
Can you just tell me the ending?

10:24.416 --> 10:25.333
I can't.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.500
Of course you can.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.833
I want to know how it ends.

10:28.916 --> 10:29.583
Please.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.500
Well, when you read a movie script,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.333
you have to take your time
to understand the characters

10:37.416 --> 10:39.458
and the situation they are in.

10:39.541 --> 10:42.166
So you truly understand them.
And my script…

10:42.250 --> 10:44.375
has four storylines in it.

10:44.458 --> 10:45.916
Just take it easy.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.625
Come on.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.833
<i>There. She doesn't get it.</i>

10:51.875 --> 10:54.166
Well, I should continue with my writing.

10:54.916 --> 10:56.583
Well, okay then.

10:57.291 --> 10:58.875
I'll keep reading.

11:00.583 --> 11:01.791
What's the password?

11:04.083 --> 11:04.916
I love you.

11:06.125 --> 11:06.833
Huh?

11:08.583 --> 11:10.500
-The password. "I love you."
-I see.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.416
That's sweet.

11:22.625 --> 11:26.375
SOMEONE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

11:40.125 --> 11:41.083
Go. Go. Go.

11:42.875 --> 11:43.791
What the hell?

11:45.333 --> 11:47.666
-Please eat chicken rice for me.
-Huh?

12:00.416 --> 12:01.291
Take this one too.

12:01.791 --> 12:03.583
I'm only bringing my friend chicken rice.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.291
Hey. Hey.

12:05.375 --> 12:06.666
Follow her.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.625
I told you, I'm bringing
chicken rice for my friend.

12:11.291 --> 12:12.083
<i>That's right.</i>

12:12.166 --> 12:14.916
<i>My story started off</i>
<i>out of nowhere, just like this.</i>

12:15.000 --> 12:17.666
<i>Only because I brought</i>
<i>my friend chicken rice.</i>

12:20.250 --> 12:22.375
Yes! Yes! Yes!

12:28.333 --> 12:29.791
I told you about gambling.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.041
Don't challenge me. I'm born for this.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.666
TRANSFER COMPLETE
THB 1,000

12:34.750 --> 12:36.041
Attaboy.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.958
We were just betting on how many
free kicks, and you still got it.

12:40.041 --> 12:41.458
Damn, this is boring.

12:41.541 --> 12:43.541
-I'm gonna go.
-Come on, one more match.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.541
How about throw-ins?

12:45.625 --> 12:46.416
Not interested.

12:48.041 --> 12:48.916
Corner kicks, then?

12:49.541 --> 12:50.791
-Corner kicks?
-Yeah.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.500
Read my lips.

12:58.083 --> 12:58.958
Fucking Fatty.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.916
Why did you call me beautiful? I'm just…

13:03.000 --> 13:05.250
kind of cute. You know?

13:05.333 --> 13:06.208
Cutesy.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.833
You need help.

13:10.416 --> 13:11.333
Move. I'm gonna take off.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.458
I gave you a chance to make up.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.666
Damn you, Fatty.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.041
Are you off tomorrow?

13:20.958 --> 13:21.791
Tomorrow?

13:22.291 --> 13:23.250
Yeah.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.166
The Japanese programmers can't come.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.583
My company can't do anything.

13:27.416 --> 13:28.333
That's lame.

13:28.958 --> 13:29.750
Right.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.083
What?

13:41.166 --> 13:43.291
I bet you two crates of beer,

13:44.291 --> 13:46.375
you can't handle staying in for two weeks.

13:47.166 --> 13:47.833
Wanna bet?

14:08.875 --> 14:10.875
Shit. It has only been three days.

14:11.916 --> 14:13.458
I'm so losing this.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.041
The doctor will call me in for a checkup.

14:22.125 --> 14:25.166
If there's no infection,
I don't have to stay in quarantine.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.875
I'll call you when I'm released, Dad.

14:28.916 --> 14:29.916
Bye.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.833
TEE

15:03.333 --> 15:04.916
CALL HISTORY, TEE

15:10.958 --> 15:12.500
TEE

15:12.583 --> 15:16.416
FUCKER TEE

15:28.875 --> 15:29.875
Fatty.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.875
Let me tell you this,
you are losing this bet.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.125
I've unlocked a new power.

15:35.625 --> 15:38.125
Have you ever seen
the first food delivery drone in Thailand?

15:39.125 --> 15:40.750
It's me.

15:40.833 --> 15:42.166
This very friend of yours.

16:04.250 --> 16:05.125
Oops.

16:05.666 --> 16:06.333
Shit.

16:06.416 --> 16:07.791
Oi! Hey.

16:08.750 --> 16:09.666
Hey, you.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.416
You… don't…

16:21.333 --> 16:22.250
Shit.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.375
You just went ahead and hit it! So crazy!

16:37.458 --> 16:38.291
Crazy how?

16:38.375 --> 16:40.208
The drone flew in out of nowhere.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.458
It could be from a pervert.

16:42.541 --> 16:43.750
Anyone would hit that.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.916
But shouldn't you check first?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.958
And you know what?
The repairs will cost tens of thousands.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.791
Don't know. Don't care.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.833
Why do I have to pay for the repair?

16:52.916 --> 16:53.833
It's not my fault.

16:53.916 --> 16:57.083
Well, well, well. That is the face
of an irresponsible person.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.291
Don't know, don't care.

16:59.666 --> 17:00.958
But I think she's cute.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.791
I'll talk to you later, Ice.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.166
Someone might be cursing me.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.041
Are you listening?

17:20.583 --> 17:21.458
Sure.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.791
Why are you smiling?

17:32.041 --> 17:33.291
Can I change the bet?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.875
I think we should level up this game.

17:38.208 --> 17:38.875
How?

17:39.916 --> 17:43.250
Hit on that girl across the building
and win her over within 14 days.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.166
What do you say?

17:49.875 --> 17:50.750
Nah.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.708
Apart from the two crates of beer,

17:53.791 --> 17:55.333
I'll give you another 20,000 baht.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.208
Wanna bet?

18:00.375 --> 18:01.125
Nah.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.125
Hey.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.333
Mr. Kongkait.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.666
Since when were you such a pussy?

18:08.083 --> 18:09.291
Afraid of losing?

18:10.458 --> 18:12.000
That's lame.

18:14.916 --> 18:17.625
<i>And my story begins here.</i>

18:20.375 --> 18:22.083
<i>You don't want to take him back?</i>

18:22.166 --> 18:23.333
I'm done.

18:23.416 --> 18:25.041
It's been a year
since I broke up with Tee.

18:25.125 --> 18:26.666
He still keeps calling me.

18:27.208 --> 18:28.916
Just let me move on, all right?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.625
<i>Okay, okay, I get that.</i>

18:31.708 --> 18:32.791
Yeah.

18:32.875 --> 18:35.875
When you are released from the hospital,
let's have some chicken rice.

18:35.958 --> 18:36.708
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

18:36.791 --> 18:39.791
You can bring your boyfriend.
I'd like to meet him.

18:39.875 --> 18:42.333
He is so damn mysterious.

18:42.416 --> 18:45.458
<i>He is such a private person.</i>

18:45.541 --> 18:46.833
<i>He doesn't even take couple selfies.</i>

18:46.916 --> 18:48.541
You better make sure

18:48.625 --> 18:50.958
that he only doesn't want
to take pictures with you

18:51.041 --> 18:52.833
because he keeps his life private,

18:52.916 --> 18:54.750
and not because he is
living a double life.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.500
Look at Tee.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.625
It came out eventually

18:58.708 --> 19:00.500
that he was seeing four other women.

19:00.583 --> 19:01.458
Damn.

19:02.416 --> 19:03.166
Shit!

19:04.416 --> 19:05.375
Why is it here again?

19:05.458 --> 19:06.791
<i>What did you say?</i>

19:06.875 --> 19:08.958
I'm not talking to you, it's that drone.

19:09.041 --> 19:09.875
Hey, gotta go now.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.625
<i>If it were you,</i>

19:53.708 --> 19:55.208
<i>would you add Khom on Line?</i>

19:57.166 --> 19:58.041
I would.

19:58.833 --> 20:00.041
First,

20:00.125 --> 20:02.625
I'd want to know
what he had up his sleeve.

20:03.208 --> 20:04.416
Second,

20:04.500 --> 20:06.750
if we didn't get along,
I'd just block him.

20:07.666 --> 20:08.708
Third,

20:08.791 --> 20:11.958
I'd want to forget my ex.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.791
This could be a way
to deal with the situation.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.083
Not too easy, is it?

20:18.166 --> 20:20.000
Come on.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.000
It's the 5G era now.

20:22.083 --> 20:23.250
Just last year,

20:23.333 --> 20:25.625
my sister married someone
she met on Tinder.

20:25.708 --> 20:27.916
-Yeah?
-But they got divorced last month.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.625
-Oh?
-Well…

20:29.708 --> 20:31.208
If it's the right person,

20:31.291 --> 20:32.666
it'll be right in every single way.

20:33.375 --> 20:36.208
If it's not, it'll end,
and we go separate ways.

20:36.708 --> 20:37.541
Get it?

20:40.458 --> 20:42.166
I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.
I COULDN'T CONTROL THE DRONE.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.125
HOME ISOLATION IS BORING.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.041
"EXTRACTION" IS A GOOD MOVIE.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.000
-SCARY?
-NO, IT'S FUN.

20:45.083 --> 20:45.958
WANT A WALK TOMORROW?

20:46.041 --> 20:46.958
OFF TO BED NOW.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.125
Whoa.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.791
You've been chatting for three days.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.416
How did you pull it off?

20:56.083 --> 20:57.208
I'm good.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.291
In 14 days,

21:04.375 --> 21:05.375
you better prepare

21:05.458 --> 21:07.041
two crates of beer

21:07.666 --> 21:10.375
and my 20 grand.

21:10.875 --> 21:13.000
Asshole! Well, aren't you confident.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.416
Where are you going?

21:25.666 --> 21:26.916
Out to dinner.

21:27.916 --> 21:29.000
Where is it?

21:29.083 --> 21:30.541
Are the restaurants open for dining in?

21:31.291 --> 21:32.375
Can I come along?

21:32.875 --> 21:33.750
Khom.

21:37.416 --> 21:41.291
THE SNACK IS TASTY
BUT THE GIVER IS TASTIER

22:51.791 --> 22:56.791
WANT TO GO WALK AROUND TOMORROW?

22:58.625 --> 23:02.208
HOW? WE NEED TO KEEP SOCIAL DISTANCING.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.250
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

23:24.625 --> 23:25.666
Ready?

23:50.291 --> 23:52.041
What is this?

23:53.500 --> 23:54.583
I don't want to do this anymore.

23:55.166 --> 23:55.833
What?

23:57.291 --> 23:59.583
You know, the bet. I don't want it.

24:00.958 --> 24:02.833
Why? Afraid of losing?

24:03.958 --> 24:05.041
I'd win.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.666
Whoa, Khom.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.541
Just because she drew you a heart?

24:09.625 --> 24:11.375
Women do that.

24:11.458 --> 24:12.583
Don't be so vain.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.416
Come here.

24:17.375 --> 24:18.416
Huh?

24:18.500 --> 24:19.416
I'm being serious.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.333
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.375
I don't even know how she feels about me

24:24.500 --> 24:26.333
but I feel bad for lying to her. See?

24:26.416 --> 24:28.625
Can you imagine?

24:28.708 --> 24:30.375
If she knows the truth,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.916
it'll be upsetting.

24:34.166 --> 24:36.208
Besides, my girlfriend
is coming back soon.

24:36.291 --> 24:37.791
She's okay now?

24:42.250 --> 24:43.250
Wait, Khom.

24:43.958 --> 24:46.791
Don't tell me that you are falling for
the girl in the building across.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.083
Shit.

24:55.375 --> 24:56.583
What if your girlfriend finds out?

24:57.125 --> 24:58.125
Dunno.

24:58.750 --> 24:59.625
Hey.

25:06.291 --> 25:07.166
TRANSFER COMPLETE
THB 20,000

25:07.791 --> 25:08.958
What is it?

25:09.041 --> 25:10.750
Don't forget my two crates of beer.

25:11.666 --> 25:12.958
I won that game.

25:13.041 --> 25:14.083
But this one, I'm out.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.333
You've become a pussy all of a sudden.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.166
All right, I think you should take off.

25:20.958 --> 25:22.458
Why are you so into it?

25:24.541 --> 25:25.666
Get your shit together, dude.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.708
I'M LEAVING NOW.
GOTTA SEE MY FRIEND FIRST.

26:30.791 --> 26:32.916
WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?
I'LL BUY IT FOR YOU.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.166
Hey!

27:43.583 --> 27:44.416
Yes.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.208
Chicken rice party as promised.

27:46.291 --> 27:48.041
And I have a surprise for you.

27:53.833 --> 27:54.916
Well, I…

27:56.208 --> 27:58.083
knocked on the wrong door, sorry.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.166
How did you get here?

28:50.500 --> 28:51.416
Jing.

28:52.416 --> 28:53.958
We need to talk.

28:54.666 --> 28:55.500
What is it?

28:58.500 --> 28:59.375
Come in.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.083
You came at the right time.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.458
-I have chicken rice.
-I have something to confess.

29:18.416 --> 29:20.208
I don't want to carry on like this.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.208
What happened between us…

29:26.708 --> 29:28.250
It was just a bet with my friend.

29:32.291 --> 29:33.500
A stupid bet.

29:37.083 --> 29:39.083
But so far between you and me,

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
it's just superb.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.166
I feel like we are good friends

29:48.250 --> 29:49.958
and I don't want to lose
a friend like you.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.291
But the truth is…

29:57.333 --> 29:58.291
I have a girlfriend.

30:12.000 --> 30:12.833
Hey.

30:14.208 --> 30:15.208
How did you get here?

30:18.125 --> 30:19.375
Jing.

30:19.458 --> 30:20.875
This is my surprise.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.500
My boyfriend lives in
the same condo as you.

30:38.833 --> 30:39.875
Fuck!

30:43.000 --> 30:45.541
That's for my plot or…

30:45.625 --> 30:46.541
for Khom?

30:46.625 --> 30:48.250
-I meant you.
-Huh?

30:48.333 --> 30:50.333
Why did you finish the story like this?

30:51.291 --> 30:52.875
Oh, well…

30:53.958 --> 30:56.041
Well, I don't like happy endings.

30:57.708 --> 31:00.250
None of us knows how our life will end.

31:02.750 --> 31:05.375
We don't always get a happy ending, right?

31:18.250 --> 31:19.291
Okay, George.

31:20.791 --> 31:21.833
Ah, yes, bro.

31:21.916 --> 31:24.750
I'll send you the file soon.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.541
Hey.

31:32.833 --> 31:35.000
-What is it?
-I want to read more.

31:37.916 --> 31:39.791
-Here.
-What's the next story?

31:39.875 --> 31:40.875
Is it about teenagers?

31:40.958 --> 31:42.416
Movies these days must be about teenagers

31:42.500 --> 31:43.916
so they make money, right?

31:44.500 --> 31:45.291
Hey.

31:46.166 --> 31:49.750
Why do you ask so much? Just read it.

31:49.833 --> 31:51.625
Well, why don't you tell me the ending?

31:51.708 --> 31:52.875
Come on.

31:52.958 --> 31:54.375
I'm joking.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.125
Why don't we find a place
to sit down and read?

32:05.500 --> 32:13.000
SOMEONE NEXT DOOR

32:13.083 --> 32:14.458
BANGKOK PITTAYAMONTREE SCHOOL

32:17.041 --> 32:18.125
STUDENT OF THE YEAR, 2021

32:18.208 --> 32:19.791
<i>This girl is Chayen,</i>

32:19.875 --> 32:21.708
<i>known as the ice queen.</i>

32:22.250 --> 32:23.625
<i>Seeing her face</i>

32:23.708 --> 32:25.000
<i>really annoys me.</i>

32:25.958 --> 32:26.958
<i>Why?</i>

32:27.583 --> 32:29.416
<i>I just feel like</i>
<i>we come from different worlds.</i>

32:31.208 --> 32:32.208
Hey, Ter!

32:32.291 --> 32:33.208
Will you pass us the ball?

32:49.250 --> 32:50.083
Shit…

32:57.666 --> 32:58.583
Luckily,

32:58.666 --> 33:00.500
the teacher, Somchai, is okay,

33:01.458 --> 33:03.750
and the school gate can be fixed.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.291
If there had been more damage,

33:06.875 --> 33:08.666
how could you have covered the expense?

33:08.750 --> 33:09.583
Teeradet.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.916
Fifty points will be deducted
from your behavior score.

33:18.125 --> 33:19.500
-Come on.
-"Come on"?!

33:19.583 --> 33:20.833
You want another punishment?

33:20.916 --> 33:22.625
You can be Mr. Somchai's
teaching aid for a month.

33:27.416 --> 33:29.291
Do you have to call in my parents?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.625
Call in your parents?

33:40.833 --> 33:41.916
Whoa, teacher.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.166
Who'd hit a student these days?

33:44.250 --> 33:46.333
"Who'd hit a student these days?"

33:47.083 --> 33:48.291
Me.

33:52.125 --> 33:53.458
What is it with you?

33:53.541 --> 33:55.500
You bring me embarrassment every day.

33:55.583 --> 33:58.125
-Such a bad son. Here. Here.
-Ouch.

34:08.458 --> 34:09.291
Shit.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.916
<i>What the hell? I meant well.</i>

34:31.625 --> 34:33.833
Never know an honor student
could give the middle finger.

34:33.916 --> 34:36.125
-Yeah? How?
-Like this.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.291
-Oops.
-Here.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.958
Are you sneaking here smoking again?

34:39.041 --> 34:40.708
And you gave me the middle finger too.

34:40.791 --> 34:43.666
Come here, I'll slap
your middle finger off.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.791
-Calm down, Mom.
-Come here.

34:45.875 --> 34:48.625
Damn, you saw her taking off her top?

34:48.708 --> 34:50.666
-It must be so magical.
-It was okay.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.208
What do you mean, "okay"?

34:52.291 --> 34:53.875
It's the ice queen.

34:56.958 --> 34:58.125
Hey. Hey.

34:58.666 --> 34:59.625
What is it?

35:00.250 --> 35:01.083
There.

35:10.458 --> 35:12.708
I think she's kinda cute.

35:13.458 --> 35:16.166
It's just that she doesn't smile much.

35:16.833 --> 35:19.916
You are so lucky, living next door to her.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.166
-More like unlucky.
-How?

35:22.750 --> 35:23.916
<i>Ter.</i>

35:24.000 --> 35:25.916
<i>Bring this yellow curry to our neighbor.</i>

35:28.750 --> 35:31.333
<i>Ter, bring the mango to our neighbor.</i>

35:31.416 --> 35:33.833
<i>Ter, go and change</i>
<i>the light bulb for them.</i>

35:36.166 --> 35:38.166
How did you fail six subjects at school?

35:39.291 --> 35:40.291
I got four last year.

35:40.791 --> 35:42.125
And this year, I got six.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.541
Isn't that cool?

35:43.625 --> 35:45.291
You think it's cool,

35:45.375 --> 35:47.291
but I'm embarrassed

35:47.375 --> 35:49.000
both as a teacher and as your mom.

35:49.083 --> 35:51.708
Look at your friend next door.

35:51.791 --> 35:54.208
She is an honor student every year.

35:55.416 --> 35:56.958
And really, what happened to your nose?

35:57.041 --> 35:58.458
I'm a man.

35:59.083 --> 36:00.333
A real man always has wounds.

36:02.666 --> 36:03.583
Come.

36:03.666 --> 36:05.041
I can help

36:05.125 --> 36:06.875
with giving you more manly wounds.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.208
Where are you going? Come back.

36:13.666 --> 36:14.958
Really?

36:15.041 --> 36:17.416
-That sounds depressing.
-Understand me now?

36:17.500 --> 36:20.458
I wish the ice queen

36:20.541 --> 36:21.750
would disappear.

36:22.416 --> 36:23.250
Disappear to where?

36:24.166 --> 36:26.833
Anywhere that is not next door.

36:29.666 --> 36:32.000
Hey, teacher. We brought them all here.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.416
Umm. Great.

36:33.916 --> 36:34.958
Why did you bring them here?

36:36.250 --> 36:39.000
I told you to bring them to the gym,
not to the assembly hall here.

36:40.250 --> 36:42.083
Bring them to the gym.

36:42.750 --> 36:44.416
You never listen.

36:46.208 --> 36:47.375
Oh well.

37:01.250 --> 37:04.458
-Goodbye, teacher.
-Goodbye. Get home safe, everyone.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.291
What are you looking at?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.291
She's gone.

37:47.708 --> 37:48.541
Where?

37:48.625 --> 37:49.416
Well,

37:49.500 --> 37:51.041
to study abroad in China.

37:51.125 --> 37:52.791
Aren't you in the same class?

37:52.875 --> 37:54.083
How come you don't know?

38:10.916 --> 38:13.166
CONGRATULATIONS!
STUDENT OF THE YEAR, 2021

38:15.625 --> 38:16.916
<i>It's strange.</i>

38:17.000 --> 38:19.250
<i>When the ice queen is not around,</i>

38:19.333 --> 38:20.500
<i>I just don't feel right.</i>

38:44.291 --> 38:45.500
Hey, teacher.

38:45.583 --> 38:47.750
-Where is your motorbike?
-It's still at the repair shop.

38:49.166 --> 38:50.791
Here, someone wants you to have this.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.750
What is it?

38:55.833 --> 38:58.041
Don't you know what a WeChat ID is?

38:58.125 --> 38:59.166
Yeah, but whose ID is this?

39:00.083 --> 39:01.583
Add it and you'll know.

39:03.125 --> 39:04.958
I shouldn't have lived near you.

39:05.708 --> 39:06.583
Hungry.

39:09.500 --> 39:13.791
<i>And I found out that night</i>
<i>whose WeChat ID it was.</i>

39:14.583 --> 39:15.541
<i>Hello.</i>

39:17.666 --> 39:18.833
Hello.

39:18.916 --> 39:20.125
<i>Well…</i>

39:21.625 --> 39:23.458
<i>I need some help.</i>

39:28.333 --> 39:29.875
I've been here for three months.

39:31.166 --> 39:33.458
<i>My dad won't have been home much.</i>

39:36.875 --> 39:38.458
There's just Tan, the housekeeper.

39:38.541 --> 39:40.125
I'm worried that
my grandma will be lonely.

39:41.375 --> 39:43.291
Can you do me a favor?

39:47.625 --> 39:48.458
What is it?

39:49.125 --> 39:51.000
<i>Can you drop off something nice for her</i>

39:51.083 --> 39:52.500
<i>and talk to her?</i>

39:52.583 --> 39:55.125
<i>I'll send you my grandma's favorites</i>

39:55.208 --> 39:57.041
<i>and wire you the money.</i>

39:57.125 --> 39:58.083
<i>Easy-peasy.</i>

39:59.750 --> 40:00.750
Who the hell are you?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.708
<i>It gets difficult when her grandma</i>
<i>starts getting Alzheimer's.</i>

40:13.375 --> 40:14.708
You like scary movies?

40:14.791 --> 40:15.708
<i>Hello?</i>

40:15.791 --> 40:16.666
<i>Hello?</i>

40:23.333 --> 40:24.208
Shit!

40:25.750 --> 40:26.708
Scared?

40:28.166 --> 40:30.291
No, Grandma. This is nothing.

40:30.708 --> 40:31.791
Shit!

40:37.666 --> 40:39.666
BLOOD DRAWING ROOM

41:35.708 --> 41:37.958
Chayen likes the taro filling.

41:38.041 --> 41:39.166
She says it's sweet.

41:39.250 --> 41:40.708
When she comes back,

41:40.791 --> 41:43.375
I'll make it for her
until she gets chubby.

41:47.750 --> 41:48.666
Who the hell are you?

41:50.625 --> 41:51.458
What?

41:51.541 --> 41:53.583
<i>I always take this route back from school.</i>

41:54.375 --> 41:56.291
<i>There is a market with a lot of snacks.</i>

41:57.708 --> 41:59.458
<i>Would you like anything?</i>

42:00.125 --> 42:01.541
<i>I'll get back in two weeks.</i>

42:02.416 --> 42:03.375
Umm.

42:04.416 --> 42:05.250
Anything.

42:05.333 --> 42:07.583
<i>Anything is kinda difficult.</i>

42:08.375 --> 42:10.916
<i>Hey, I talked to my grandma the other day.</i>

42:11.000 --> 42:13.666
<i>Thank you for everything you do.</i>

42:14.333 --> 42:15.916
<i>I'll bring you some souvenirs.</i>

42:18.458 --> 42:19.541
Hey.

42:22.291 --> 42:23.083
Ter.

42:25.125 --> 42:25.916
Hey.

42:42.416 --> 42:44.625
<i>The ice queen is not icy at heart.</i>

42:45.166 --> 42:46.708
<i>Her smile melts my heart.</i>

43:03.416 --> 43:05.333
You really took your time.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.916
I'm always late because of you.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.625
<i>The Chinese government has announced</i>
<i>that they will lock down Shanghai</i>

43:09.708 --> 43:11.500
<i>to contain the virus</i>

43:11.583 --> 43:14.375
<i>and stop the spread of COVID-19.</i>

43:16.583 --> 43:19.625
CHINESE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES LOCKDOWN
TO CONTAIN CORONAVIRUS

43:25.208 --> 43:26.291
Mom.

43:26.375 --> 43:27.250
Hmm?

43:28.250 --> 43:29.583
Why do you love Dad?

43:32.041 --> 43:33.250
What's wrong with you?

43:33.750 --> 43:35.125
What an odd question.

43:36.750 --> 43:39.833
You told me that when dad hit on you,

43:40.666 --> 43:41.708
you hated him so much.

43:44.416 --> 43:48.083
Your dad had some qualities
that others don't.

43:48.166 --> 43:49.416
And they were…?

43:49.500 --> 43:50.708
Your dad made good Pad Thai.

43:50.791 --> 43:52.166
Oh…

43:52.250 --> 43:53.625
"Oh" what?

43:54.666 --> 43:56.166
Actually, love

43:56.250 --> 43:57.958
comes from the little things

43:58.041 --> 43:59.583
that we do for each other every day.

44:00.375 --> 44:01.666
The love that is

44:01.750 --> 44:03.791
over the top
and overly sweet romantic love

44:03.875 --> 44:05.166
like you see in movies?

44:05.250 --> 44:06.291
Fake.

44:11.375 --> 44:12.958
So you fall in love with Dad?

44:14.125 --> 44:15.625
-I hated him even more.
-Whoa.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.541
Why are you surprised?

44:20.958 --> 44:23.625
Well, your dad made me love him,

44:24.125 --> 44:26.666
and then he went around selling insurance.

44:26.750 --> 44:28.791
I didn't see him much in the year.

44:30.041 --> 44:31.583
Not long after you were born,

44:33.708 --> 44:35.500
he happened to die.

44:35.583 --> 44:37.166
How can I not hate him?

44:41.708 --> 44:43.000
Well, that's love.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.583
You don't have to hide it.

44:47.500 --> 44:50.541
Every woman in the whole universe
is good at hiding.

44:53.250 --> 44:54.333
How about you?

44:55.166 --> 44:56.666
Have you made any woman hate you?

45:05.666 --> 45:07.208
<i>Does this count as hate?</i>

45:17.458 --> 45:18.333
How is it going?

45:19.041 --> 45:20.083
I'm okay.

45:22.208 --> 45:25.708
I only stay in my room
and can only use the internet sometimes.

45:26.541 --> 45:29.291
<i>But at least they provide us</i>
<i>with survival packs.</i>

45:30.666 --> 45:33.500
The embassy has informed us that

45:33.583 --> 45:34.708
if we're lucky,

45:36.416 --> 45:38.041
there might be a flight home next week.

45:38.833 --> 45:39.625
Really?

45:42.208 --> 45:43.416
But I'm not sure

45:44.625 --> 45:45.958
if I'll get to go back…

45:50.625 --> 45:52.000
or when I'll go back.

46:01.875 --> 46:04.666
I've never missed home like this before.

46:08.166 --> 46:09.875
Please take care of my grandma.

46:11.250 --> 46:12.416
No.

46:12.500 --> 46:14.000
She's your grandma.
You come back to look after her.

46:14.083 --> 46:16.750
Why are you saying this?

46:18.041 --> 46:19.083
Well…

46:19.166 --> 46:19.916
well…

46:20.583 --> 46:22.250
Then you'll get to come back soon.

46:29.375 --> 46:30.250
What are you smiling about?

46:31.916 --> 46:32.916
Nothing.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.875
It's strange.

46:35.958 --> 46:40.083
We lived next door for a long time
but we've never talked this much.

46:43.875 --> 46:44.791
It's not strange.

46:48.458 --> 46:49.666
<i>You and I…</i>

46:49.750 --> 46:51.083
<i>we live in different worlds.</i>

46:59.208 --> 47:00.166
That's true.

47:07.833 --> 47:08.833
Well…

47:09.958 --> 47:11.833
when I get back, can I ask you something?

47:12.916 --> 47:14.041
Of course.

47:14.125 --> 47:15.250
What do you want to know?

47:23.416 --> 47:24.333
<i>Can I…</i>

47:30.000 --> 47:30.750
Oh, hey.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.375
Damn.

47:35.541 --> 47:37.833
Why is it frozen now?

47:39.708 --> 47:41.000
Damn.

48:12.916 --> 48:14.958
Can I come to your world?

49:37.541 --> 49:39.583
<i>We are bringing you the meal.</i>

49:39.666 --> 49:40.666
Oh. Okay.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.750
-Sick bastard.
<i>-Picking on me again.</i>

49:55.833 --> 49:57.958
Don't look puzzled. I meant you.

49:58.041 --> 49:58.958
<i>There.</i>

50:00.791 --> 50:01.625
Well…

50:02.416 --> 50:03.958
Why are you mad at me?

50:05.250 --> 50:08.083
Why do you always write the ending
like it's unfinished?

50:08.166 --> 50:09.791
Did Chayen make it back home?

50:09.875 --> 50:11.708
Does Ter ever find out that
Chayen is into him?

50:11.791 --> 50:13.500
Will they get together?

50:13.583 --> 50:15.000
What happens after this?

50:15.083 --> 50:17.208
Why do you write crappy endings?

50:17.291 --> 50:18.208
Hey.

50:18.291 --> 50:20.791
I don't know in what way it's crappy.

50:21.791 --> 50:23.625
I think open endings are good.

50:23.708 --> 50:25.083
It's up to the viewer's interpretation.

50:25.166 --> 50:26.583
Your movie is gonna flop.

50:27.791 --> 50:28.666
What?

50:30.791 --> 50:33.041
Actually, you can stop reading

50:33.666 --> 50:35.416
so you'll stop criticizing.

50:37.375 --> 50:38.875
Don't be so paranoid.

50:38.958 --> 50:40.458
I might like your next story.

50:43.458 --> 50:45.041
But I'll say so again if I don't like it.

50:52.458 --> 50:57.125
SOMEONE YOU HATE

51:13.000 --> 51:15.500
<i>Have you ever hated someone's guts</i>

51:15.583 --> 51:17.166
<i>even though you've never seen their face?</i>

51:20.000 --> 51:21.083
<i>This</i>

51:21.166 --> 51:22.541
<i>is the one I'm talking about.</i>

51:23.708 --> 51:25.916
<i>It's not because they're working</i>
<i>for a rival company.</i>

51:26.750 --> 51:30.041
<i>It's because I see them all the time.</i>

51:30.125 --> 51:32.208
<i>Either this intersection or the next.</i>

51:32.291 --> 51:34.250
<i>I've raced with them many times.</i>

51:34.333 --> 51:36.375
<i>Two losses, one win.</i>

51:36.458 --> 51:37.791
<i>That's our score.</i>

51:38.375 --> 51:40.750
<i>Today, we'll race again.</i>

52:52.041 --> 52:54.708
Dad will get mad if he sees that.

52:55.916 --> 52:56.875
Don't let him see then.

52:57.958 --> 52:59.500
-What?
-Bribe me.

53:06.875 --> 53:08.291
-Here.
-I don't like green.

53:08.375 --> 53:09.583
I prefer the red ones.

53:10.083 --> 53:11.000
Whoa.

53:15.791 --> 53:18.375
Just take a blue one.
I need to save up for motorbike repairs.

53:26.083 --> 53:27.750
I've told you many times.

53:27.833 --> 53:29.166
You are a girl.

53:29.250 --> 53:30.500
Why don't you play with dolls?

53:30.583 --> 53:33.125
Dolls are for ordinary girls.

53:33.208 --> 53:34.500
I'm extraordinary.

53:36.333 --> 53:38.166
-Says who?
-Says me.

53:40.916 --> 53:42.500
I'll build a rocket when I grow up.

53:42.583 --> 53:44.541
A rocket that can take me anywhere.

53:48.125 --> 53:48.916
What are you smiling at?

53:49.000 --> 53:51.541
You always make a stupid face, Aod.

53:51.625 --> 53:52.416
Oh?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.625
-I'm your brother. How could you…?
-Ouch.

54:14.625 --> 54:17.375
Aod, when will Dad come home?

54:43.291 --> 54:46.666
While he is sleeping,
do you think he has dreams?

54:52.708 --> 54:53.625
Dunno.

54:54.291 --> 54:55.458
Maybe he does.

54:58.291 --> 55:00.916
I hope you have a nice dream

55:01.583 --> 55:04.166
that you make a lot of money
from driving a taxi.

55:04.250 --> 55:07.125
Don't forget to dream about Ing and Aod.

55:27.208 --> 55:29.708
MEDICAL BILL

55:29.791 --> 55:31.708
TOTAL AMOUNT: 54,508 BAHT

55:40.458 --> 55:43.041
I thought you'd quit racing
and gone back to studying

55:43.125 --> 55:45.375
and had become a delivery man.

55:45.458 --> 55:48.666
COVID messed you up?
Can't cope with the new normal?

55:51.041 --> 55:52.708
Don't waste your time talking.

56:01.083 --> 56:02.875
Prepare to lose your gold, bro.

56:11.541 --> 56:14.583
Just look at my ride.
It's just been modified.

56:35.750 --> 56:37.916
-Smooth, right?
-Where do you want your funeral held?

56:38.000 --> 56:40.041
Any temple with beautiful decorations.

56:40.125 --> 56:41.125
Bastard.

56:43.958 --> 56:45.291
Shit. Daddy is here.

56:45.375 --> 56:46.833
Shit. Daddy is here.

56:46.916 --> 56:48.958
-Your dad is a policeman?
-My mom likes a man in a uniform.

56:49.041 --> 56:49.833
Bastard!

56:49.916 --> 56:51.500
Let's go.

56:52.250 --> 56:54.291
-Bro, how about my gold?
-Come get it tomorrow.

56:54.375 --> 56:55.500
Hey, Peud.

57:12.250 --> 57:13.291
What's wrong?

57:17.125 --> 57:19.041
Come on. Don't die on me now.

57:24.875 --> 57:25.833
Shit.

57:26.750 --> 57:28.583
<i>At that second, I thought I'd go to jail.</i>

57:29.083 --> 57:30.625
<i>But they turned up.</i>

57:31.333 --> 57:33.250
<i>Yes. That person.</i>

57:37.000 --> 57:39.166
Hey! Stop!

57:39.833 --> 57:44.333
Stop right there!

57:58.125 --> 58:00.125
<i>What should I say?</i>

58:00.208 --> 58:01.458
<i>I don't want to say thank you.</i>

58:05.500 --> 58:10.125
<i>I've always imagined what that bastard</i>
<i>must look like under that helmet.</i>

58:23.000 --> 58:24.458
Don't you know how to say thank you?

58:25.541 --> 58:26.250
Thank you.

58:27.666 --> 58:29.416
-You don't have to.
-What?

58:29.916 --> 58:31.625
I'm not done with you.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.708
I don't want you to get arrested.

58:33.791 --> 58:34.708
That's all.

58:34.791 --> 58:37.666
<i>Damn, even her shrug is cute.</i>

58:38.291 --> 58:39.166
<i>What do I do now?</i>

58:42.083 --> 58:43.125
Wanna get something to eat?

58:43.208 --> 58:45.333
<i>Eh? There's the way.</i>

58:59.000 --> 59:00.500
How did you know I like this flavor?

59:05.375 --> 59:06.750
I know more than that.

59:37.041 --> 59:37.958
You'll die tomorrow.

59:39.416 --> 59:40.166
What?

59:41.375 --> 59:42.833
I said,

59:42.916 --> 59:44.125
tomorrow

59:44.208 --> 59:46.041
you'll die.

59:47.541 --> 59:48.291
Huh?

59:48.833 --> 59:49.791
How do you know?

59:50.416 --> 59:51.958
-Are you a fortune teller?
-No.

59:54.375 --> 59:55.750
I'm from the future.

1:00:04.458 --> 1:00:06.750
-Don't believe me, do you?
-Nah.

1:00:06.833 --> 1:00:07.625
I'd be dumb to.

1:00:10.916 --> 1:00:11.875
But it's true.

1:00:16.375 --> 1:00:17.375
Tomorrow,

1:00:17.958 --> 1:00:19.166
if you go racing,

1:00:19.875 --> 1:00:21.166
you will be

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.375
munched like Cocoa Crunch.

1:00:34.750 --> 1:00:37.875
Thank you so much, Chut, for my motorbike.

1:00:41.708 --> 1:00:42.833
Thank you, sir.

1:00:58.541 --> 1:01:00.208
Ing, let's go upstairs.

1:01:01.125 --> 1:01:02.083
Come on.

1:01:29.416 --> 1:01:31.666
I have come a long way to see you.

1:01:32.666 --> 1:01:34.208
Don't disappoint me.

1:01:52.208 --> 1:01:53.250
<i>Who is she?</i>

1:01:53.875 --> 1:01:56.208
<i>Is she from the future,</i>
<i>or is it just a prank?</i>

1:01:56.875 --> 1:01:59.541
<i>But the present here is so real.</i>

1:01:59.625 --> 1:02:02.291
TOTAL AMOUNT: 54,508 BAHT

1:02:44.541 --> 1:02:48.083
I think you are so kind to be my sponsor.

1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:20.666
Tomorrow, you'll die.

1:04:03.083 --> 1:04:04.125
How could you get it?

1:04:05.458 --> 1:04:08.291
I'm glad to see you here.

1:04:08.958 --> 1:04:10.250
Take it.

1:04:30.541 --> 1:04:32.000
Though I have enough money,

1:04:32.791 --> 1:04:34.541
I don't know if my dad will recover.

1:04:37.833 --> 1:04:39.000
Stop complaining.

1:04:40.583 --> 1:04:42.708
You don't know the future like I do.

1:04:44.666 --> 1:04:45.916
And quit making that stupid face.

1:04:46.625 --> 1:04:47.833
Aren't you going to see your dad?

1:04:47.916 --> 1:04:49.791
Oh, yeah.

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:56.750
Wait up.

1:05:01.375 --> 1:05:02.750
So who are you?

1:05:05.708 --> 1:05:06.916
You dolt.

1:05:07.458 --> 1:05:09.041
Don't you remember?

1:05:19.458 --> 1:05:21.458
<i>I'll build a rocket when I grow up.</i>

1:05:21.541 --> 1:05:23.833
<i>A rocket that takes me anywhere.</i>

1:05:35.250 --> 1:05:36.250
<i>You go for sci-fi?</i>

1:05:37.250 --> 1:05:38.125
Yeah.

1:05:38.791 --> 1:05:40.333
You think it's over the top?

1:05:42.750 --> 1:05:43.750
I don't know.

1:05:45.375 --> 1:05:46.166
But…

1:05:47.500 --> 1:05:49.916
if someone really came from the future…

1:05:54.416 --> 1:05:55.708
and told me

1:05:56.458 --> 1:05:58.583
what was going to happen,

1:05:59.875 --> 1:06:01.125
that would be nice.

1:06:05.208 --> 1:06:06.375
And…

1:06:07.833 --> 1:06:10.625
if it's bad news?

1:06:19.458 --> 1:06:20.375
Well,

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.625
good news or bad news,

1:06:24.833 --> 1:06:25.875
at least

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:28.333
you don't have to wait in the unknown

1:06:30.416 --> 1:06:34.208
and get drowned with hope
or fear day by day.

1:06:35.208 --> 1:06:37.750
That's more traumatizing.

1:06:42.250 --> 1:06:46.458
<i>Visiting hours for in-patients</i>
<i>and emergency patients are over.</i>

1:06:46.541 --> 1:06:50.125
<i>Relatives can visit tomorrow</i>
<i>during visiting hours.</i>

1:06:50.208 --> 1:06:51.333
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:06:58.208 --> 1:06:58.958
Hey.

1:07:00.958 --> 1:07:02.208
Thanks for the drink.

1:07:02.291 --> 1:07:03.666
No worries.

1:07:03.750 --> 1:07:06.250
A trade for your movie script.

1:07:20.291 --> 1:07:21.333
Hey.

1:07:21.416 --> 1:07:22.083
Hmm?

1:07:22.166 --> 1:07:24.166
I never asked you.

1:07:24.250 --> 1:07:25.375
Who are you visiting here?

1:07:26.958 --> 1:07:28.000
My boyfriend.

1:07:32.833 --> 1:07:33.833
Bye-bye.

1:07:41.708 --> 1:07:48.541
SOME SECRET ADMIRER

1:07:55.166 --> 1:07:56.375
35,7

1:08:06.958 --> 1:08:07.750
Tom.

1:08:09.083 --> 1:08:11.791
-What?
-Is 33,2 considered a fever?

1:08:13.791 --> 1:08:14.833
I don't think so.

1:08:15.375 --> 1:08:17.125
But I think you're dead.

1:08:17.208 --> 1:08:18.958
How can someone's temperature
be 33 degrees Celsius?

1:08:26.166 --> 1:08:27.666
The thermometer must be broken, Hoodlum.

1:08:31.375 --> 1:08:32.583
<i>This guy is Suer.</i>

1:08:32.666 --> 1:08:35.541
<i>It means "tiger," but he's a wuss.</i>

1:08:35.625 --> 1:08:37.250
<i>He is a man of determination.</i>

1:08:40.791 --> 1:08:42.125
<i>Determination to line up water bottles.</i>

1:08:42.208 --> 1:08:43.750
<i>The brand must align.</i>

1:08:44.291 --> 1:08:46.250
<i>To find ticks on dogs.</i>

1:08:48.833 --> 1:08:50.666
<i>To memorize the clients' names.</i>

1:08:50.750 --> 1:08:52.375
Hello, Mr. Noo.
Would you like some sausages?

1:08:52.875 --> 1:08:54.250
Hi, Mr. Pom. How are you?

1:08:54.333 --> 1:08:56.291
Hey, Mr. Tu. Nice shirt.

1:09:03.500 --> 1:09:06.500
So sleepy. How come
Joom never assigns me a morning shift?

1:09:06.583 --> 1:09:07.541
That's good.

1:09:08.125 --> 1:09:09.625
You don't have to go out drinking.

1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:11.958
What's wrong with drinking?

1:09:13.125 --> 1:09:15.541
Drinking is not bad, but being drunk is.

1:09:16.458 --> 1:09:19.041
You ask for trouble when you are drunk.

1:09:27.625 --> 1:09:28.666
I like it.

1:09:29.333 --> 1:09:30.333
I like night shifts.

1:09:31.958 --> 1:09:33.041
Not as many clients.

1:09:33.583 --> 1:09:34.708
It's cooler.

1:09:35.833 --> 1:09:36.916
I get to play with the dog.

1:09:38.625 --> 1:09:40.458
Really, Suer?

1:09:41.250 --> 1:09:42.875
I don't think those are the reasons.

1:09:46.916 --> 1:09:48.041
What are you talking about?

1:09:53.916 --> 1:09:54.833
Hi.

1:10:02.708 --> 1:10:04.250
That's the reason.

1:10:25.708 --> 1:10:26.750
Hey.

1:10:26.833 --> 1:10:28.375
What should I get for the doc?

1:10:31.625 --> 1:10:32.666
How about this?

1:10:33.291 --> 1:10:34.500
So spicy that it'll wake him up.

1:10:34.583 --> 1:10:36.666
-He should like it.
-I see.

1:10:36.750 --> 1:10:37.666
Thank you.

1:10:42.833 --> 1:10:44.958
<i>The only thing that</i>
<i>Suer is never determined about</i>

1:10:45.041 --> 1:10:47.625
<i>is telling his crush how he feels.</i>

1:10:48.875 --> 1:10:50.250
See you later.

1:10:54.875 --> 1:10:57.708
I'm going, Hoodlum. Bye.

1:11:05.166 --> 1:11:08.291
He has a crush on her,
but she has a crush on the dentist.

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.500
She leaves stuff for him
in the fridge every day.

1:11:15.375 --> 1:11:17.000
FOR DR. NOOM

1:11:19.166 --> 1:11:20.958
Club Friday stuff.

1:11:31.041 --> 1:11:33.958
What does this dentist look like?

1:11:45.416 --> 1:11:46.916
How do you know

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.708
that the dental clinic is still open?

1:11:48.791 --> 1:11:50.250
They close at 9:00 p.m.

1:11:50.333 --> 1:11:52.666
How do you know that
that dentist is still here?

1:11:52.750 --> 1:11:54.291
He goes home 8:30 p.m.

1:11:54.375 --> 1:11:55.541
Whoa.

1:11:56.833 --> 1:11:58.625
You have done some homework, haven't you?

1:11:59.416 --> 1:12:01.875
So, do you have a crush
on the nurse or the dentist?

1:12:04.666 --> 1:12:07.375
-Take painkillers only when it hurts.
-Where is he?

1:12:07.875 --> 1:12:11.000
-The next appointment is next week.
-Yes.

1:12:11.083 --> 1:12:13.083
-Thanks so much.
-Goodbye.

1:12:14.958 --> 1:12:16.208
Whoa.

1:12:16.291 --> 1:12:17.750
He's so ugly.

1:12:18.250 --> 1:12:19.583
Even I look better.

1:12:26.416 --> 1:12:27.416
What is it?

1:12:28.083 --> 1:12:29.041
Over there.

1:12:29.583 --> 1:12:30.541
He is a doctor.

1:12:31.208 --> 1:12:33.083
You are a dog.

1:12:33.791 --> 1:12:35.708
You don't have a chance, Suer.

1:12:35.791 --> 1:12:37.375
You are degraded to just a cat.

1:12:43.541 --> 1:12:44.666
-What are you looking at?
-Piss off.

1:12:52.041 --> 1:12:52.916
Looking for dental care?

1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.166
Yes… a bit of toothache.

1:12:55.250 --> 1:12:55.958
Which one?

1:12:56.041 --> 1:12:57.541
I don't know. Ask him.

1:13:02.166 --> 1:13:03.458
Umm.

1:13:05.291 --> 1:13:08.041
You have a severe cavity.
You need fillings.

1:13:08.125 --> 1:13:09.500
Be cautious about COVID.

1:13:09.583 --> 1:13:11.583
I'll clean up the infected area

1:13:11.666 --> 1:13:13.875
and we'll have an appointment
for fillings later.

1:13:13.958 --> 1:13:15.416
I'll give you an anesthetic shot.

1:13:21.208 --> 1:13:22.208
What is it?

1:13:23.125 --> 1:13:24.666
Huh? What did you say?

1:13:27.125 --> 1:13:29.625
He asked if it'll hurt.

1:13:29.708 --> 1:13:33.375
Oh, not at all. You won't feel a thing.

1:13:33.458 --> 1:13:35.166
-Come on.
-Ouch. No.

1:13:38.333 --> 1:13:40.666
"Can we do it later?"

1:13:40.750 --> 1:13:43.750
Let's do it now. It won't hurt much.

1:13:43.833 --> 1:13:44.833
You'll be fine. Come on.

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.458
You said it won't hurt.

1:13:50.541 --> 1:13:52.833
Did I say it wouldn't hurt?

1:13:54.666 --> 1:13:55.916
I don't remember that.

1:13:56.583 --> 1:13:57.875
-Just a bit.
-No.

1:13:57.958 --> 1:13:59.916
-Like an ant's bite.
-No.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.458
-Just a bit.
-No.

1:14:01.541 --> 1:14:04.875
-It'll hurt a bit and then you'll be fine.
-Get out.

1:14:06.750 --> 1:14:07.708
Ouch.

1:14:14.666 --> 1:14:15.916
Doctor.

1:14:16.583 --> 1:14:18.708
-Can you get up?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:14:20.750 --> 1:14:21.708
Are you all right?

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:23.500
Yes, I'm fine. I'm okay.

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:24.916
Come on.

1:14:26.375 --> 1:14:27.208
Hey.

1:14:28.041 --> 1:14:29.500
Nurse, do you see the syringe?

1:14:34.125 --> 1:14:34.958
Ah.

1:14:35.791 --> 1:14:37.166
That's all right. We'll get a new one.

1:14:37.250 --> 1:14:39.916
<i>How's the script so far?</i>

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.375
I like that he is determined.

1:14:43.375 --> 1:14:45.166
Try and play with his determination.

1:14:45.250 --> 1:14:47.083
I think desperate guys are cute.

1:14:50.291 --> 1:14:51.125
Right.

1:14:54.916 --> 1:14:56.458
Are you Kawin's relative?

1:14:57.625 --> 1:14:58.333
Yes.

1:14:58.416 --> 1:15:00.708
The doctor wants to talk to you.

1:15:01.208 --> 1:15:01.958
Come with me.

1:15:02.041 --> 1:15:02.833
Yes.

1:15:09.416 --> 1:15:10.500
We'll talk later.

1:15:19.750 --> 1:15:21.625
<i>She said we'd talk later.</i>

1:15:23.583 --> 1:15:25.291
<i>I also wanted to talk to her.</i>

1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:27.708
<i>But after that,</i>

1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.125
<i>I didn't see her for days.</i>

1:16:00.791 --> 1:16:01.958
HAPPY NEW YEAR, 2023

1:16:02.041 --> 1:16:06.541
<i>I still remember what you told me</i>

1:16:06.625 --> 1:16:10.541
<i>I'm still overwhelmed</i>
<i>Just thinking about it</i>

1:16:21.916 --> 1:16:28.500
<i>It rains over there, the chills reach here</i>

1:16:28.583 --> 1:16:33.750
<i>I still want to hear everything</i>

1:16:34.416 --> 1:16:37.708
<i>Do you still go to bed late?</i>

1:16:37.791 --> 1:16:40.750
<i>Did you lose weight?</i>

1:16:40.833 --> 1:16:44.291
<i>Don't forget to share it with me</i>

1:16:58.625 --> 1:17:02.791
Well, I haven't seen you
for days, so I thought

1:17:02.875 --> 1:17:05.125
that your boyfriend had been released.

1:17:05.208 --> 1:17:07.500
Oh, he hasn't been.

1:17:08.541 --> 1:17:11.291
I went around to make merit for him.

1:17:11.375 --> 1:17:12.125
I see.

1:17:12.208 --> 1:17:15.083
I went everywhere
my friends said was a holy place.

1:17:15.166 --> 1:17:16.916
-Yeah.
-There was a temple…

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.791
The bread for fish looked yummy.

1:17:18.875 --> 1:17:20.083
I tried it.

1:17:20.958 --> 1:17:22.208
It tasted kinda nice.

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:25.875
I actually didn't spend
that much time doing that.

1:17:26.625 --> 1:17:28.083
The rest, I…

1:17:28.166 --> 1:17:30.583
spent packing up my boyfriend's stuff.

1:17:33.708 --> 1:17:34.458
Well…

1:17:35.375 --> 1:17:37.125
When the doctor called me in,

1:17:39.250 --> 1:17:40.333
he said that…

1:17:43.791 --> 1:17:46.166
my boyfriend doesn't have much time left.

1:18:08.583 --> 1:18:09.666
Come on.

1:18:12.166 --> 1:18:13.208
I'm okay.

1:18:22.416 --> 1:18:25.833
So what's the rest of your movie script?

1:18:29.416 --> 1:18:30.625
DENTISTRY

1:18:47.333 --> 1:18:48.833
Whoa.

1:18:49.541 --> 1:18:51.291
Just because she likes a dentist,

1:18:51.375 --> 1:18:53.666
you're trying to become one?

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:55.666
Isn't that wishful thinking?

1:18:55.750 --> 1:18:57.375
I gotta try.

1:18:57.916 --> 1:18:58.958
But there are some things

1:18:59.041 --> 1:19:00.958
you're just destined to end up failing.

1:19:01.041 --> 1:19:04.875
By the time you are accepted
and you graduate,

1:19:04.958 --> 1:19:07.875
she'll be bringing her kids
to you for dental care.

1:19:07.958 --> 1:19:09.000
Right, Hoodlum?

1:19:28.708 --> 1:19:29.500
Hey.

1:19:30.541 --> 1:19:33.458
He knows that
the snacks in the fridge are mine.

1:19:38.083 --> 1:19:41.750
THANKS FOR THE SNACKS
FROM DR. NOOM

1:19:45.875 --> 1:19:46.833
Does he?

1:19:48.333 --> 1:19:49.125
How is it going then?

1:19:51.750 --> 1:19:53.083
So he…

1:19:53.958 --> 1:19:55.833
invited me for a dinner at his condo.

1:19:56.333 --> 1:19:57.208
That's nice, right?

1:20:03.125 --> 1:20:04.541
Umm, that's nice.

1:20:11.125 --> 1:20:12.541
That's all I wanted to tell you.

1:20:13.250 --> 1:20:14.541
I gotta get back to work.

1:20:15.458 --> 1:20:16.500
See ya.

1:20:20.708 --> 1:20:21.500
Bye.

1:20:29.750 --> 1:20:33.041
"At his condo."
I don't think it's just dinner, Suer.

1:20:33.708 --> 1:20:34.833
<i>Just admit it.</i>

1:20:34.916 --> 1:20:36.291
<i>Let's find a new crush.</i>

SEVERAL DAYS LATER

1:21:20.458 --> 1:21:21.458
Hey.

1:21:22.833 --> 1:21:23.833
What happened to you?

1:21:24.791 --> 1:21:26.541
I went out drinking the other night

1:21:27.041 --> 1:21:29.291
and fought with a bunch of pricks.

1:21:29.375 --> 1:21:30.791
I told them

1:21:30.875 --> 1:21:32.708
to meet after we closed.

1:21:32.791 --> 1:21:33.791
Because I know

1:21:33.875 --> 1:21:35.750
that we're open 24 hours a day.

1:21:37.541 --> 1:21:40.166
But damn it, I forgot

1:21:40.250 --> 1:21:42.333
that we have to close after 10:00 p.m.

1:21:42.416 --> 1:21:43.875
They were waiting behind our shop.

1:21:43.958 --> 1:21:45.208
So punctual.

1:21:45.291 --> 1:21:46.958
All standing there like boy band members.

1:21:47.875 --> 1:21:49.666
Don't make me talk so much.

1:21:49.750 --> 1:21:51.625
-It hurts.
-I didn't make you talk.

1:21:53.375 --> 1:21:54.250
You'd better take some medicine.

1:22:02.625 --> 1:22:03.416
What is it?

1:22:30.541 --> 1:22:31.875
He has a girlfriend.

1:22:36.583 --> 1:22:38.208
I saw them together.

1:22:43.666 --> 1:22:45.375
That day at his condo…

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:47.666
he might just…

1:22:59.125 --> 1:23:00.541
I'm so stupid.

1:23:05.583 --> 1:23:07.750
I've just realized

1:23:08.708 --> 1:23:10.333
how hurtful it is to be played.

1:23:16.250 --> 1:23:18.083
But it's not as hurtful

1:23:20.291 --> 1:23:23.333
as when I saw him throw away the snacks.

Oh, God! No!

1:24:14.166 --> 1:24:17.000
Please calm down.

1:24:17.083 --> 1:24:20.000

<i>I think that was Suer's determination</i>

1:24:28.750 --> 1:24:30.666
<i>to show her his love.</i>

<i>But afterward,</i>

1:24:50.166 --> 1:24:52.291

1:24:56.708 --> 1:24:59.375
<i>She resigned and moved back to Chiang Mai.</i>

<i>Rumor has it that she had a child</i>

<i>As for Suer,</i>

<i>he resigned soon after that.</i>

1:25:13.708 --> 1:25:15.750
<i>Nobody knows where he went.</i>

1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.458
<i>But I believe that</i>

1:25:21.041 --> 1:25:23.916
<i>he must be determined</i>
<i>to do something, somewhere.</i>

1:25:24.916 --> 1:25:31.458
CHIANG MAI

1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:39.625
Where have you been?

1:25:39.708 --> 1:25:42.083
Did you play games until the battery died?

1:25:42.166 --> 1:25:43.125
No.

1:25:43.208 --> 1:25:44.791
If you don't cry today,

1:25:44.875 --> 1:25:46.625
I'll buy you two ice creams.

1:25:46.708 --> 1:25:48.666
-Good.
-Very good.

1:25:48.750 --> 1:25:50.958
Next patient. You can see the doctor now.

1:25:51.041 --> 1:25:52.291
Let's go.

1:25:52.916 --> 1:25:54.583
Let me pick up my stuff.

1:25:56.500 --> 1:25:57.833
Mek, is it?

1:25:59.958 --> 1:26:01.708
Umm, five years old.

1:26:03.625 --> 1:26:07.041
Have you brought him here
for dental care before?

1:26:24.708 --> 1:26:25.583
Hello.

-Well…

1:27:12.083 --> 1:27:14.291
Wh… why?

1:27:14.916 --> 1:27:18.250
You told me
to play with his determination.

1:27:19.583 --> 1:27:20.583
So, here.

1:27:21.375 --> 1:27:24.250
And in real life,

1:27:24.958 --> 1:27:27.375
even a garbageman can be a pilot.

1:27:31.666 --> 1:27:33.083
Why? Is the script

1:27:33.791 --> 1:27:34.916
not good?

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.166
You don't like it?

1:27:36.833 --> 1:27:38.083
Of course I do.

1:27:38.166 --> 1:27:39.916
I like this ending.

1:27:40.416 --> 1:27:43.333
See? You can write a story
with a happy ending.

1:27:43.416 --> 1:27:44.291
It's cute.

1:27:53.458 --> 1:27:54.333
Well…

1:27:55.958 --> 1:27:59.791
I actually don't know
how to write these kinds of things.

1:28:00.791 --> 1:28:02.125
But it's because…

1:28:06.041 --> 1:28:07.416
Because of what?

1:28:17.708 --> 1:28:18.875
Because…

1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:34.875
-Because…
-Hey.

1:28:34.958 --> 1:28:36.125
The patient woke up.

1:28:38.583 --> 1:28:40.625
It's you, boy.

1:28:40.708 --> 1:28:42.916
Your mom woke up.
Seems like she wants to see you.

1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:44.375

-Congratulations.

<i>I'll watch your movie at the cinema.</i>

<i>that when I got to talk to my mom again</i>

1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.833
<i>would be the same time that Bua</i>
<i>had to say goodbye to her boyfriend.</i>

<i>My mom remained in the ICU</i>

<i>and what she is doing.</i>

1:31:28.916 --> 1:31:31.333
