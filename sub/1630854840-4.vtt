WEBVTT

00:16.891 --> 00:20.228
Don't worry, little friend.
You're going to be right as rain.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.439
<i>Kill me.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:29.696
-<i>Where's my mum?</i>
-<i>Help. Quick. He's coming.</i>

00:29.779 --> 00:31.781
-<i>He's coming.</i>
-<i>My fucking bone.</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:33.658
<i>Why have my owners abandoned me?</i>

00:33.742 --> 00:35.744
-<i>I'm afraid.</i>
-<i>Gonna scratch the shit out of ya.</i>

00:35.827 --> 00:37.912
-<i>I was in here first.</i>
-<i>¿Dónde estoy, carajo?</i>

00:37.996 --> 00:39.581
<i>Esto no es el bosque.</i>

00:39.664 --> 00:42.917
-<i>Please don't take my testicles.</i>
-<i>Where's my mom and dad?</i>

00:43.793 --> 00:45.420
-<i>What is going on here?</i>
-Sorry.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.506
<i>Just do it. Do it, you coward.</i>

00:51.760 --> 00:54.429
-<i>Anyone there?</i>
-<i>Let me out! Let me out!</i>

00:54.512 --> 00:57.891
<i>Go on. Walk away.</i>
<i>Like you always do.</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:06.858
<i>Hungry. I'm hungry. Hungry.</i>
<i>Hello, I'm hungry. Food, please.</i>

01:07.442 --> 01:10.195
-<i>I hate it here!</i>

01:28.838 --> 01:29.839
Jizzlord?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.443
-Yep, he's microchipped.

01:52.904 --> 01:55.365
12 Prudence Drive. David.

01:55.448 --> 01:59.160
Do you reckon that's the owner's name
or his name? Who calls a cat David?

02:00.662 --> 02:02.956
This world doesn't make sense
to me anymore.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.542
Yeah,
that's probably his old owner's address.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.626
Jen's my owner now.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.254
No, I'm not.
You need to stop telling people that.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.172
Hey, maybe David knows where I come from.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.298
Wait.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.093
Are you experiencing post-transformational
long-term memory loss

02:15.176 --> 02:16.177
and generalised aphasia?

02:16.261 --> 02:19.973
Yeah, I-- I'm experiencing
post-transformational long-term…

02:20.056 --> 02:22.225
…aphasia.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.393
Yeah, he's fucked.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.147
You poor thing.
I couldn't do that.

02:27.230 --> 02:31.234
Not knowing who you are. Who you were.
Drive me mad.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.153
I was adopted, you know.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.906
First thing that I did when I turned 18
was find out who my birth mother was.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.408
We have a great relationship,

02:38.491 --> 02:41.953
but at the same time, I did discover
I'm a blood relative of Fred West,

02:42.036 --> 02:44.914
so… mixed bag, isn't it?

02:49.544 --> 02:50.545
Ooh.

02:50.628 --> 02:55.300
Oh, uh, I wouldn't go for that one.
Racist.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.649
So it's a consultation,
which is free. Which is good.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.527
And then an assessment and then
a personalised treatment plan.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.946
-<i>When's your consultation?</i>
-I haven't booked it yet.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.033
What?

03:20.116 --> 03:22.660
<i>You've always been a bit of</i>
<i>a procrastinator, haven't you?</i>

03:22.744 --> 03:23.745
No, I'm not.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.080
<i>Oh, you absolutely are.</i>

03:26.164 --> 03:28.875
She had to book a smear test
a few months ago, Martin,

03:28.958 --> 03:32.587
and oh, my God.
I had to book it for her in the end.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.797
It was all clear, by the way. Thank God.

03:34.881 --> 03:35.715
Carrie.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.342
<i>A bit of privacy, please?</i>

03:39.344 --> 03:40.345
<i>You know…</i>

03:40.428 --> 03:42.180
No, don't do a dad speech.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.766
<i>Look, it's okay if you're scared.</i>
<i>It's a big commitment.</i>

03:44.849 --> 03:49.020
I'm not scared.
And I'm not a procrastinator, okay?

03:49.103 --> 03:51.481
I'll book it as soon as I hang up.
Promise.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.774
<i>Love you.</i>

03:52.857 --> 03:53.858
Love you.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.575
It can wait.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.203
Mmm.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.008
Stop thinking about your mission
for two seconds, please.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.053
But this is important.
I can have sex with you any time.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.266
No, do-don't you dare--

04:31.854 --> 04:34.023
Stop thinking about your mission
for two seconds, please.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.485
Of course. You know you're
the most important thing to me.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.947
There's just so much to do.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.659
Everyone keeps asking me questions
about the mission tonight.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.744
Didn't realise being a hero
would have so much admin.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.998
I would quite like
to have sex with you right now.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.501
I can do both. It's not like you need
more than one hand anyway.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.753
You get the ball rolling,
and I'll jump in.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.596
Housekeeping.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.433
No, it's me. It's Carrie.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.685
Why are you wearing a hazmat suit?

05:10.768 --> 05:14.772
Oh, giving the flat a little spring clean.
Thought I'd start from the top down.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.528
-What?
-You haven't come in a while.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.487
How'd you know?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.115
You throw yourself into housework
when you're sexually frustrated.

05:24.198 --> 05:27.327
Don't be silly. It's just a freshen up.

05:27.410 --> 05:32.373
A mop, scrub, hoover, curtain steam, dust,
maybe do a charity shop run.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.043
What's this? It looks like junk.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.128
It's hookup lost and found.
It's mainly Luke's stuff.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.006
If he hasn't texted me in a while,
I find a sock under my bed,

05:40.089 --> 05:42.425
and I have to return it. Oh, in fact…

05:45.428 --> 05:47.930
How much do you think it costs
to hire a power washer for the day?

05:48.014 --> 05:50.683
Oh, hey! Gordon. Oh, he'll see you right.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.145
One touch and bam, orgasm sorted.
I'll text you his address.

05:54.228 --> 05:57.690
-No, that's basically cheating.
-Just bash one out, then.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.361
I've tried. I can't seem to get there.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.196
Maybe there's something deeper
going on then.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.698
You know, the heart and the vag
are very closely linked.

06:05.782 --> 06:10.411
No, no, no, no, no. I just need to come,
and then everything will be fine forever.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.622
Is it time? Can we go? Is it time to go?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.874
-Are you going out?
-We're tracking down who Jizz used to be.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.168
You shouldn't be going out
until you've booked your consultation.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.669
-Who says I haven't?
-Have you?

06:18.753 --> 06:21.214
-No.
-Promised your dad you would.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.467
What's he gonna do, haunt me?
I'll do it after we solve him.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.427
We're going to his old owner's house.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.763
I bet he'll have
some great stories to tell.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.309
Or not.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.741
-That's me.
-I see you were close.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.830
"Hercule." What a dumb name.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.165
Oh, Jizzlord, look.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.836
Do you remember winning, um,
"best mixed breed short-hair"?

06:59.919 --> 07:01.546
Jen, I think I killed him.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.341
-What?
-I ran away,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.760
and it bummed out his heart
so hard he died.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.971
-No, I don't think that--
-Was I a bad pet?

07:10.054 --> 07:12.098
No. You're great.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.559
Look how many rosettes you won for your…

07:15.768 --> 07:16.811
proud rump.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.922
Why are you staring at a dog?

07:45.006 --> 07:47.508
That's not a dog. That's a demon.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.593
Oh, he's so cute.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.178
-Hello.
-No, he's not.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.180
We hated each other.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.432
I'd piss in his garden.
He'd piss on my wall.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.310
If anyone here knows anything about me,
it's that thing.

07:57.393 --> 08:01.230
We should take him to the vet.
Make him talk.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.732
I know you're still learning,

08:02.815 --> 08:05.401
but it's generally frowned upon
to steal a dog from a funeral.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.112
Okay, that's out then.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.740
Let's just go home and then do that thing
you don't wanna do.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.080
Run, run, run, run.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.145
He definitely does not like you.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.189
I don't know where he's picked up
the word "cuck,"

08:43.272 --> 08:45.024
but he's using it quite a bit.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.195
Ask him if he knows anything
about Jizzlord's past.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.571
Where he came from.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.324
-He says he does know where he came from.
-Where?

08:55.243 --> 08:58.704
Homo island?
That's not a real place, is it?

08:58.788 --> 09:01.666
-No, yeah, it's obviously not. And yet…
-Stop it!

09:02.291 --> 09:04.794
-I hope you get put down.
-Jizzlord!

09:04.877 --> 09:07.964
He says he's going to put you down first
and then steal your woman.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.590
Hey, I'm on your side, you wee shit.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.343
Oh, uh, he says he does actually
have some genuine information,

09:12.426 --> 09:14.804
but he wants something in return.

09:18.182 --> 09:21.435
A day out. He hates his owner.
He wants to do what he wants.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.104
-Tell him we'll do whatever he needs.
-No!

09:23.729 --> 09:27.149
We have to do this. By the end of today,
you're not going to be Jizzlord anymore.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.611
You could be Paul, or Matt,
or some other white guy.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.696
The sky's the limit.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.490
I wouldn't mind getting out
for an afternoon.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.200
Just gets a bit much sometimes.

09:37.159 --> 09:40.037
It's their little screams.
They never leave you.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.584
Tito, what do you want to do?

09:47.753 --> 09:49.880
Does anyone know what "king shit" is?

11:01.202 --> 11:04.580
Thank you! I respect your choices!

11:05.414 --> 11:06.582
I don't think I like this.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.334
Me either!

11:25.893 --> 11:28.396
-Do you need any help?

11:28.479 --> 11:32.108
Oh, thanks a lot.
This takes ages to clean up.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.569
Oh, s-so sorry.
I-I think I might have a tissue somewhere.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.071
-Dickhead!
-No.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.157
You say you were helping people?

11:40.241 --> 11:42.576
Uh, no. We're helping women, not people.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.745
It's just I've locked myself out my flat.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.248
We need to be available
in case the women need us.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.541
Like this young lady.

11:48.624 --> 11:49.625
Fuck off.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.824
-What is this?

12:21.907 --> 12:25.077
Origin of the slang term "boner,"
which is pretty hilarious if you--

12:25.161 --> 12:26.162
I like that.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.707
Uh, none for me. Thanks, gang.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.086
Okay, okay.

12:34.837 --> 12:39.008
I've never done this before.
I have to admit, I'm a little curious.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.142
-Ladies, please!
-Guys, let's just--

12:48.225 --> 12:50.936
Tiffany,
you have my LinkedIn! Find me!

12:51.520 --> 12:52.813
I know my rights!

12:52.897 --> 12:54.023
Go away! Bye!

12:54.106 --> 12:57.777
You're making a big mistake!
I have really good credit rating!

12:57.860 --> 13:01.197
-Here we are.
-Right, Ade. Your time to shine.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.824
Phase through the wall
and open the door from the other side.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.869
-Uh, who? Who me?
-Yeah. Do your thing.

13:06.952 --> 13:10.039
Uh...
C-Can I have a word, please, Kash?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.874
-Mm-hmm.
-Um…

13:11.957 --> 13:17.087
So, my thing, it only works with my body.
I can't take anything with me.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.172
Okay.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.967
So that means my clothes--
I can't-- I have-- I--

13:26.347 --> 13:27.848
I have to be nude,

13:27.932 --> 13:31.143
and I'm not very comfortable
with my body right now, to be honest.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.856
-No one look, okay?
-Don't worry. No one can see you.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.428
I'm stuck.
I didn't think it would be this thick.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.805
Just keep going.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.391
I'm trying, uh,
but can you still see me?

14:12.059 --> 14:14.395
Uh, yeah. A little bit.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.524
Is it my arse?
Oh, my God, is it my arse?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.569
You can do this, Ade. Dig deep.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.696
I literally can't.
I don't have the energy.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.490
-I wonder if you clench and then wiggle…
-Try changing the angle.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.367
-You've gotta believe in yourself.
-Push it.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.411
-Like a little bit more to your right.
-Grind it.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.704
I know when I'm stuck.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.789
-Push! Push!
-Stop telling me I'm not stuck!

14:33.873 --> 14:35.541
-Sure.
-All right.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.668
Kash, you stay with Ade
until he gets his strength up.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.212
The rest of you come with me.
It's ladies' night at All Bar One.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.464
I'm sure there will be
plenty of targets there.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.591
Wait, no!

14:43.674 --> 14:47.219
But you're the leader.
I'm sure you'd never leave a man behind.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.308
Don't save anyone without me!

14:52.391 --> 14:54.226
How about now? Still out?

14:54.852 --> 14:57.229
Where next? Casino?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.148
I've already blown through
the money I set aside

14:59.231 --> 15:01.650
for my laser eye surgery, but flip it.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.528
-Oh, right.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.990
He says you guys know how to party,
and he's ready to tell you.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.619
He used to run into you
when you were a stray.

15:11.702 --> 15:16.165
Always in the same alleyway,
off Coburn Circus.

15:16.248 --> 15:19.960
Must've been your territory. He says
he hopes you find what you're looking for.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.962
Thank you, Tito.

15:25.549 --> 15:26.926
Thank you, Tito.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.347
Uh, he has one more request.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.515
He's had enough of this human life.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.769
He wants to be free
like the wolves of old.

15:37.811 --> 15:43.400
Free to roam and hunt.
To feel cool earth and hot blood.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.422
-Uh…

16:05.506 --> 16:07.091
I'll take him back to the surgery.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.566
-Hello.
-Hello.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.112
I'm Jen's flat-mate.
I just wanted to drop off this.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.948
You left it behind when you and Jen--

16:32.032 --> 16:34.326
When the incident occurred.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.205
Oh, uh, well, thanks, I guess.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.672
-Would you like to come in?
-Yes.

16:52.302 --> 16:55.431
<i>Alpha team,</i>
<i>potential damsel-in-distress.</i>

16:55.514 --> 16:59.435
<i>Look tipsy. No coat.</i>
<i>Could be Geordie. Can't confirm.</i>

16:59.518 --> 17:01.437
<i>Lady helpers, converge.</i>

17:01.520 --> 17:02.771
No, no, wait for me.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.482
<i>Ignore that. Converge.</i>

17:05.566 --> 17:07.818
No, wait for me. Hello?

17:07.901 --> 17:09.319
<i>Converge, converge!</i>

17:14.033 --> 17:17.578
Ade, mate, you'll be all right
if I nip on, won't you?

17:17.661 --> 17:21.623
No. Don't leave me. Kash. Kash!

17:27.171 --> 17:28.547
Anything coming back to you?

17:30.674 --> 17:31.675
No.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.974
I'm not ready to give up yet.
Let's sit down, have a drink, regroup.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.144
They've got a 6% blood orange IPA on tap.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.274
What?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.276
You know this pub.

17:49.359 --> 17:52.029
What if it was your local
when you were human?

17:52.112 --> 17:54.615
And I'm really sorry to break this to you,

17:54.698 --> 17:56.533
but I think you might have been
a craft beer guy.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.035
-Is that bad?
-Yeah.

17:58.786 --> 17:59.787
Yeah, it is.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.974
Excuse me. Do you know this man?

18:21.058 --> 18:23.435
Did he use to come in here at all?
Do you know anything about him?

18:23.519 --> 18:26.563
Uh, no, I don't,
but the landlady is coming in soon.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.398
She owns the place. She might know.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.068
Just like that?

18:31.151 --> 18:32.194
Just like that.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.613
Just like that.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.556
-So does Jen ever mention me?
-Can you make me come?

19:03.892 --> 19:07.312
Do you have any idea how many people
come to me with this exact problem?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.148
It's just, my boyfriend's really busy,

19:09.231 --> 19:11.150
and it feels like
he doesn't have time for me.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.610
That sounds like a general lack
of intimacy in your relationship.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.070
I can't really help you with that.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.990
-Oh, God. Oh, God. Uh…

19:18.657 --> 19:19.783
Don't cry. Um…

19:19.867 --> 19:23.662
Okay, I'll-- Yeah. I'll help. I'll help.
Just please, just don't cry.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.507
Viper to alpha group.
Update on location.

19:37.634 --> 19:40.554
Alpha group? I know you can hear me!

19:41.263 --> 19:44.766
<i>Kash-- I mean Viper.</i>
<i>Uh, we need you. We need backup.</i>

19:44.850 --> 19:48.729
<i>Exeter Avenue.</i>
<i>This is kicking off. Oh, God. Oh, God!</i>

19:48.812 --> 19:49.813
Yes.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.758
Maybe you should wash your hands first.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.469
Oh, uh, yeah, sure.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.645
Can't stand the waiting.
I just wanna know.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.105
You know, like, what did you do for a job?

20:32.189 --> 20:37.277
I can't see you interacting with people
or technology or heavy machinery.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.738
What would you want it to be?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.157
We're so close to finding out who you are.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.408
Aren't you excited?

20:43.492 --> 20:44.993
Yeah, I feel sick. Yeah.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.788
Great. I'm going to the loo.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.016
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Get off!

21:11.436 --> 21:12.980
-Kash.
-What happened?

21:13.063 --> 21:15.023
Turn back time. Undo!

21:15.107 --> 21:18.402
So now you see why you need me, eh?
Now you see why I'm in charge.

21:18.485 --> 21:21.947
-Kash!
-Oh, there's no rush. Chill out, mate.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.297
I've never hit on your girlfriend, man.
Have you seen her?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.435
-Have you seen her?
-Seb, duck!

22:20.881 --> 22:22.549
-Kash--
-Fuck off, Gregor. I know!

22:22.632 --> 22:26.928
Viper, we need backup. We need you.
Exeter Avenue. This is kicking off.

22:30.891 --> 22:31.725
You!

22:33.060 --> 22:34.186
Are you with them?

22:34.269 --> 22:36.980
-Kash, help us!
-Kash.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.523
-Kash. Kash.
-Please.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.525
-No, mate. Don't know 'em.
-Oh, my God.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.614
Just… Okay!
All right. No, just--

22:45.697 --> 22:47.407
-Kash!
-Kash, help us!

22:57.834 --> 23:01.171
All right, so how do you wanna do this?
Firm handshake, or…

23:03.590 --> 23:06.676
No. I can't. I'm sorry.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.812
You're right. This is wrong. I'm a freak.

23:17.437 --> 23:20.899
No. You have a gift.
You can bring joy to people.

23:20.982 --> 23:26.279
You invited me into your home,
and you tried to help me. You're a hero.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.740
Really?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.764
Are you the come man?

23:55.976 --> 23:56.977
Yes, I am.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.726
What the fuck? Why did you disappear?

25:19.809 --> 25:21.853
You can't just abandon people like that.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.485
Oh, and it was a dead end,
by the way.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.238
'Cause I actually went
to the bother of finding out.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.032
You can't just make me give a shit
about helping you and then quit.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.159
Do you not care about
finding out who you are?

25:37.035 --> 25:38.036
What about me?

25:38.119 --> 25:41.081
What if I want to know
who this man is I've let live with me?

25:43.917 --> 25:45.710
What if I don't like him?

25:45.794 --> 25:47.212
Well, at least you'll know.

25:48.171 --> 25:51.508
You can't keep putting it off just because
it might not be the answer you want.

25:55.679 --> 25:56.888
You're so smart.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.141
I'm not.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.644
I'm a fucking idiot.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.522
I'm scared.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.066
I'm scared I'll go to this clinic,

26:08.149 --> 26:10.443
and nothing will change,
and then I won't even have hope.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.778
I'll just have me.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.698
I don't like me.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.783
I like you.

26:19.494 --> 26:20.912
When you're not shouting at me.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.206
It's when you're eating something
you're not meant to.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.253
You know, if I'm finding out,
then you should too.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.093
Let's find out how shit we are together.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.909
Works every time.

27:00.869 --> 27:01.870
Ooh.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.957
Should get new ones cut.
Looks like you live here now.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.294
But you have to stop chewing
charging cables.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.214
Why do you put up with me?

27:17.177 --> 27:18.261
Soft spot for strays.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.944
You go on any nice holidays recently?

27:35.028 --> 27:36.529
Yeah, Budapest.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.865
Oh, yeah. Missus wants to go to Prague.

27:38.948 --> 27:42.827
Ah, but Prague's nice.
They say Split's the same but cheaper.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.121
Oh, yeah? I must check it out.
