02:12.800 --> 02:14.634
Right beside you!

02:20.474 --> 02:22.167
So I was thinking maybe
you'd come down to the dealership...

02:22.267 --> 02:23.752
sign a few balls or something
this Saturday.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.254
Nobody wants my autograph, Milt.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.089
You never know, man. Come on, seriously.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.607
Last time worked out.
Could be a win-win for both of us.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.637
Oh, there she is.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.180
Shots.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.766
I got this. Don't reach for your wallet.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.393
All right, man.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.702
- No, don't reach for your wallet.
- Thank you.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.996
Here you go, sunshine.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.541
Next round's on me, I guess.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.753
Thank you!

02:52.381 --> 02:54.199
- Oh!
- Ladies and gentlemen...

02:54.299 --> 02:55.784
I think there's somebody here tonight...

02:55.884 --> 02:57.578
who deserves just a little bit
of recognition, all right?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.455
- Uh-oh, here it is.
- Oh, no.

02:59.555 --> 03:02.890
Now, it's not because
he's a regular here at Stevie Ray's...

03:03.892 --> 03:05.085
Is he talking about me?

03:05.185 --> 03:08.005
Or because he was an All-American
at Stevenson High School...

03:08.105 --> 03:10.799
True story, true story.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.968
Or even because he was a Detroit Tiger.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.152
That's right! Oh, yeah!

03:16.697 --> 03:18.265
Simply because it's his birthday.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.642
Give it up for Calvin Campbell.

03:20.742 --> 03:24.062
He's a jolly good fellow

03:24.162 --> 03:26.315
He's a jolly good fellow

03:26.415 --> 03:29.234
He's a jolly good fellow...

03:29.334 --> 03:32.587
- Oh, a cake!
- Which nobody can deny

03:47.436 --> 03:50.521
Ah, dang it. Dang it.

03:53.358 --> 03:57.513
Hey, Katie bear. Hi.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.281
You said you'd be home by 9:30, Dad.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.059
I know. I'm sorry.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.268
Dang it, I'm sorry.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.312
Milt and Frankie...

04:05.412 --> 04:07.439
they wanted to celebrate my birthday...

04:07.539 --> 04:12.945
so they took me out for some...
dinner... and we just got a little...

04:13.045 --> 04:15.697
- You're drunk.
- No.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.798
Yeah.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.202
Yeah, not too much
that I can't drive, though...

04:20.302 --> 04:22.287
if that's what you're thinking,
'cause I'm good.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.098
Um, sweetheart, we're going
to celebrate when I get home, okay?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.809
Hello?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.027
Oh, God.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.351
This guy's drunk. Look at this.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.243
He's a mess!

04:52.084 --> 04:53.902
Uh, where do you think
you're going, hmm?

04:54.002 --> 04:56.071
- It's 11:15.
- Out with Colt.

04:56.171 --> 04:59.700
No, no. I told you that I didn't want you
to see that boy anymore.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.244
Yeah? Well, at least somebody loves me.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.872
You are 16 years old.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.472
I'm 17, Dad.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.544
What happened to us
spending my birthday together?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.811
What happened?

05:13.772 --> 05:14.480
I don't know.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.908
What time did you get home?

06:23.008 --> 06:24.660
Late.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.761
- You making some for me?
- Yes.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.581
I know late. What time?

06:29.681 --> 06:30.582
I don't know.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.642
Colt won his sprint car heat.
We went out to celebrate.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.563
At least I got to celebrate
something with somebody.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.692
I like my eggs over easy.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.977
Yeah, I want to say
something about Colt.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.619
He's like a...

06:53.121 --> 06:55.456
He's like a fastball from Nolan Ryan...

06:55.582 --> 06:57.776
when he was in the prime of his game.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.628
- What does that even mean?
- It means he's too much for you to handle.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.548
Dad, can't we just have
a normal conversation with breakfast?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.220
Yeah, that's fine.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.213
What are you going to do today?

07:18.313 --> 07:20.314
- Mall and movie.
- Hmm.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.150
- I need the car.
- I'm using the car.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.848
Don't you think it's about time
you got a real job again, Dad?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.991
So we can afford things?
Like, say, two cars?

07:31.118 --> 07:33.160
You know what?

07:33.286 --> 07:36.064
I'm the dad and you're the kid.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.233
So you don't talk to me
about getting a job...

07:38.333 --> 07:39.735
or getting a second car.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.669
Do you understand me?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.865
The other thing about Colt, young lady,
is that he is too old for you.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.492
And I know what old kids want.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.969
- I know what they're after.
- Okay.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.807
Are you guys having...
Are you having sex?

07:55.809 --> 07:56.976
Really?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.645
Really, Dad? Really?

08:02.607 --> 08:05.025
You are such a freaking hypocrite.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.345
I can have all the sex I want.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.822
You were obviously
doing it in high school.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.768
Yeah.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.603
Yeah, exactly,
and I don't want you to make...

08:14.703 --> 08:16.537
the same mistakes that I was making.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.207
So, I'm a mistake?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.401
That's not what I said, Katie.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.445
- Wow, Dad.
- Katie...

08:23.545 --> 08:25.629
- that's not what I said.
- Well, you did.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.748
You know what?
Maybe you don't like Colt...

08:34.847 --> 08:37.042
because you're just jealous
he's an athlete on the way up...

08:37.142 --> 08:40.561
and you're... you.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.076
Dexter, how are you?

09:31.947 --> 09:35.074
Ooh. Whoops.

09:37.369 --> 09:40.814
Hey, Produce, uh... sorry, pal,

09:40.914 --> 09:43.108
I think I just trampled
on one of your vegetables.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.693
A tomato is a fruit.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.585
What'd you say?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.490
A tomato is a fruit.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.802
So are avocados, cucumbers, and olives.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.804
- All fruits.
- Huh.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.639
Well...

09:58.765 --> 10:00.808
that's pretty good information.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.377
- Thanks.
- You're pretty smart.

10:02.477 --> 10:06.047
- You think I'm smart?
- Uh... sure.

10:06.147 --> 10:10.567
Do you want to see how smart that I am?

10:12.487 --> 10:14.639
You know what? Maybe another day.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.184
I'm just... I'm not really
in the mood for it today, man.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.186
- Sorry about that.
- Okay.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.453
Have a magnificent day.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.653
All right.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.864
Hey, Miss Amy, how you doing?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.241
Hey, Produce. I'm great.
How are you doing?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.410
- Incredible.
- Nice to see you.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.912
Nice to see you.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.512
Look what I'm getting.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.707
Mr. Campbell, you over there
messing with Produce?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.584
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sorry.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.920
Just having a conversation
with him, Colt.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.854
I'm sure it was compelling.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.885
You know? All right, see you.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.596
But also putting strawberries
on the top of waffles.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.015
- Look at you.
- Okay.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.867
- What else is fresh today?
- Tomatoes are fresh.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.436
They look good.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.772
Hey, Produce, uh, thank you
for that information...

11:03.872 --> 11:06.274
over there about the fruits
and vegetables and...

11:06.374 --> 11:08.610
You're welcome. My mama said...

11:08.710 --> 11:11.112
- those are not good for you.
- This?

11:11.212 --> 11:14.214
Well, your mama sounds
like a smart person, too.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.117
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.619
Could be good advice.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.304
Could be good advice if I followed it.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.960
Hey, he's a s... uh, you know?

11:25.060 --> 11:27.045
- The hugging.
- He's a hugger.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.588
What's that about?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.189
It's just his way of being friendly.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.067
Yeah.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.153
I'm Calvin.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.740
Amy.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.704
It's nice to meet you, Amy.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.581
Nice to meet you.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.778
Would you like to have somebody
to help you shop more?

11:51.878 --> 11:53.337
Please help me shop.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.571
Yeah!

12:21.241 --> 12:23.351
Thanks, man.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.145
That was beautiful.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.147
Thank you.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.790
It still needs a lot of work,
but I appreciate it.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.654
Look... there's no one here, Frank.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.714
I could really use an extra hand
cleaning up in the back.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.536
Laura, I'm not the janitor.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.011
I know, but...

12:51.604 --> 12:54.815
Hey, buddy, it was a beautiful song.

12:56.985 --> 12:57.943
It got me.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.113
They're lucky to have you here, Frankie.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.367
What's this? She forget her broomstick?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.037
She left that for me.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.585
Got work to do. I'll see you later, man.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.855
You didn't leave me any coffee.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.758
You know how to work
the coffeemaker, Katie.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.843
No, you drank it all, Dad.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.762
There's none in the bag.
That's what I'm saying.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.181
Well, I will...
I will run to the store...

13:43.281 --> 13:46.158
and get some more
when I'm finished with my paper.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.022
Hey, Dad?

13:51.122 --> 13:53.499
How about we go
see a movie or something later?

13:55.627 --> 13:56.877
I'd love to, Katie...

13:58.046 --> 14:01.449
but I think I have to meet
Milt and Frank later.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.217
Sorry, kiddo.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.301
Hi, Mr. Campbell.
How you doing this afternoon?

14:20.401 --> 14:22.637
I'm fine. How are you?

14:22.737 --> 14:24.431
I'm doing good.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.657
Even when I'm doing bad, I'm doing good.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.868
Sounds pretty deep.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.412
Have a magnificent day.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.545
You know what?

14:41.923 --> 14:43.825
Um...

14:43.925 --> 14:47.245
I wasn't being honest with you, Produce.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.929
I'm not fine.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.416
Well, are you sick?

14:51.516 --> 14:55.602
- I don't think so.
- Maybe you just need to smile.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.133
"A cheerful heart is good medicine."

15:00.027 --> 15:02.143
Where'd you get that? A bumper sticker?

15:03.278 --> 15:04.945
You told me that I was smart.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.015
- Remember?
- Yeah.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.017
You want to see how smart I am?

15:09.117 --> 15:11.019
Uh...

15:11.119 --> 15:12.452
well, I'll tell you what.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.288
Maybe not today, because I got to...

15:14.414 --> 15:15.956
I got to...

15:16.082 --> 15:17.984
- Pick up that melon.
- All right.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.112
They label all of these
fruits and vegetables...

15:21.212 --> 15:23.755
with some numbers on them.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.134
But I know the number
on the top of that melon.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.970
- Okay, go.
- 4329.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.472
Yeah, 4329.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.308
That's correct.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.878
That's impressive, Produce. Good job.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.839
Pear. Anjou.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.175
4422.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.651
Yep. Correct.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.222
Banana. That's the easy one.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.557
Everybody likes bananas.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.325
4011.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.897
Gala apple. 4135.

15:55.997 --> 15:59.817
Orange. 9669.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.403
Tangerine. 3144.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.489
Granny Smith apple. 4017.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.658
Yeah. There we go.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.159
I'm really impressed.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.676
I mean, you're kinda like
"Rain Man" or something.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.178
Like Superman or Batman!

16:11.304 --> 16:13.764
Oh! Ow.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.809
You're proud of me 'cause I'm smart.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.130
- I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell.
- No, that's all right.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.939
He didn't realize he was bugging you.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.344
What did I tell you
about hugging the customers?

16:26.444 --> 16:28.820
Now you get back to work, young man.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.266
You have a nice day, Mr. Campbell.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.892
- You, too, Dexter.
- I'm sorry about the hug.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.451
Nah, like I said.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.439
Hey, Produce.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.873
I'm impressed.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.784
- Frank?
- Hi, Susan.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.452
Is Milt here?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.387
Is everything okay?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.055
Yeah, yeah, it's good.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.416
I just need to talk to him.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.849
Yeah, come in.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.630
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, nice to see you.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.481
- You, too.
- Milt.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.136
- Hey, buddy, what's up?
- What's up, man?

17:08.236 --> 17:09.596
- What's up?
- You doing all right?

17:09.695 --> 17:11.405
Yeah. What's going on?

17:12.406 --> 17:13.891
Okay, um...

17:13.991 --> 17:15.977
there's no easy way
to ask you this, so...

17:16.077 --> 17:17.103
Okay.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.271
I need to borrow some money
for a hotel room.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.148
It's not long. I'll pay you back.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.068
- What happened?
- I got evicted.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.086
Hadn't paid in a while,
so kind of had it coming.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.088
Well, you're not getting
in any hotel, all right?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.949
You stay here, all right?
We got plenty of room.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.492
- You're like family.
- Man, I...

17:31.592 --> 17:33.844
No, no, no, no. Stay here.
We got plenty of room.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.963
So I got some towels
if you want to take a shower...

17:44.063 --> 17:46.231
and help yourself
to anything in the kitchen.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.761
Thank you.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.445
You're welcome.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.211
No. Colt, hang on.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.866
What? What's going on?

18:11.966 --> 18:13.800
Just slow down.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.641
What the hell are you doing?

18:36.741 --> 18:39.394
I'm cold.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.995
Come on, take that jacket off,
get back in bed.

18:44.749 --> 18:48.403
You know how many girls
want to get with me right now?

18:48.503 --> 18:51.171
But here I am.
I'm trying to be faithful to you.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.968
I just want it to be special
for my first time.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.250
Wait, you... so you're...
You're a virgin?

19:02.350 --> 19:03.850
- Yeah.
- But you said that you've been...

19:03.976 --> 19:06.978
I know. I... I lied.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.441
I just wanted you
to like me, so I said it.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.700
This is awesome, you know that?

19:22.119 --> 19:24.522
Listen, I got some wine
out in my Jeep, okay?

19:24.622 --> 19:27.108
It's in a box, so we don't need
an opener or anything.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.277
- That's special, right?
- You don't get it.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.461
No, you don't get it, Katie.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.716
You can't just tease a guy like this.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.885
I said just lay back down.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.891
Katie?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
Hey, Katie?

19:55.736 --> 19:58.306
Hey, Katie bear, I just...

19:58.406 --> 20:00.407
I just wanted to come say good night.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.145
Wha... hey.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.539
What are you doing
with your jacket on in your bed, huh?

20:11.586 --> 20:13.503
Hey, what's wrong?

20:19.510 --> 20:21.011
Is there something I can do to help?

20:23.055 --> 20:23.930
Please get out.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.895
Okay.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.876
Hey, Mr. Campbell. How you doing?

20:53.628 --> 20:54.862
Where's the shopping cart?

20:54.962 --> 20:56.421
I don't know.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.009
I'm not here to shop.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.012
I guess I just, uh...

21:05.473 --> 21:07.208
I guess I just came to talk.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.141
To me?

21:09.477 --> 21:11.311
Yeah, to you.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.006
I guess I could use
some of that magical happiness...

21:14.106 --> 21:15.440
that you always seem to have.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.515
- So, what's your secret?
- It's no secret, Mr. Campbell.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.350
Well, you're doing something right.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.743
You're doing a heck
of a lot better than I'm doing.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.860
Do you think that
I'm smart enough to do anything?

21:33.960 --> 21:37.128
Anything in the whole wide world?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.242
- Well, come on.
- Uh, where are we going?

21:41.342 --> 21:44.302
All right. Where...

21:45.012 --> 21:46.581
Where are we going, buddy?

21:46.681 --> 21:48.848
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look it.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.419
I'm not authorized personnel.
I can't go back there.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.754
Please, Mr. Campbell? Come... please?

21:53.854 --> 21:55.355
- Come on.
- All right.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.315
- Come on.
- What are we doing?

22:00.861 --> 22:02.445
What? What is this?

22:03.447 --> 22:06.032
I'm not smart enough to be
the Employee of the Month.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.535
Oh, shoot.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.855
Yeah, you are.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.331
- Really?
- Let me ask you a question.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.944
Do you think that Colt...

22:17.044 --> 22:20.865
can name every fruit number...

22:20.965 --> 22:23.758
on every piece of fruit in the store?

22:24.552 --> 22:26.287
But I can name all the vegetables, too.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.221
Yeah, exactly.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.390
That's my point. He can't do that.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.859
Hey, Produce.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.196
Sometimes...

22:47.241 --> 22:49.810
well, sometimes life...

22:49.910 --> 22:51.479
is not fair.

22:51.579 --> 22:52.813
You know?

22:52.913 --> 22:54.706
And sometimes we don't get what we want.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.670
What do you do for work?

23:02.757 --> 23:05.451
Well, uh...

23:05.551 --> 23:07.260
I've done... I don't know...

23:07.386 --> 23:09.455
I've done a few things...

23:09.555 --> 23:11.222
here and there.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.503
I used to play baseball.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.103
Wow!

23:17.229 --> 23:19.173
Will you show me how?

23:19.273 --> 23:20.675
Well, you know, I haven't... whoa...

23:20.775 --> 23:23.010
I haven't played baseball
in a long, long time, Produce.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.179
I've always wanted to play baseball.

23:25.279 --> 23:26.613
You really want to learn how to play?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.198
Yeah!

23:31.035 --> 23:32.285
Okay.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.479
This is what I want you to do.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.939
I want you to stand over this box.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.941
That's the home plate.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.694
And then you're just going
to swing this broomstick...

23:39.794 --> 23:41.920
like it's a baseball bat.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.491
Hey, Produce?

23:45.591 --> 23:48.327
Not on the box. Over the box.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.997
There you go.
Just stand like that, okay?

23:51.097 --> 23:52.540
All right, Produce...

23:52.640 --> 23:55.876
I just want you to keep
your eye on the ball.

23:55.976 --> 23:59.171
- It's an orange.
- That's very perceptive.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.298
Just swing when it comes
near you, all right?

24:01.398 --> 24:02.774
All righty then.

24:09.323 --> 24:13.326
I'm going to hit a home run!

24:13.452 --> 24:15.521
Well, not if
I strike you out first, kid.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.455
You ready?

24:18.457 --> 24:20.416
Here comes the heater.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.462
Oh!

24:25.756 --> 24:27.658
- It's all right.
- Strike one.

24:27.758 --> 24:28.868
It's all right.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.578
Here's what I want you to do.

24:30.678 --> 24:33.372
I want you to keep
your shoulders in, okay?

24:33.472 --> 24:36.667
Keep your eye on the orange.

24:36.767 --> 24:39.086
And I always want you to look
for the rotation of the pitch...

24:39.186 --> 24:40.421
at its highest point, okay?

24:40.521 --> 24:42.423
That's when it's leaving my...

24:42.523 --> 24:45.191
Never mind, just...

24:45.317 --> 24:47.986
- just swing away and have fun.
- Okay.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.867
Oh, yeah, Produce!

24:53.993 --> 24:56.494
Highest point, all right?

24:57.163 --> 24:58.663
Oh! Close.

25:01.542 --> 25:02.292
All right.

25:04.879 --> 25:05.837
There we go.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.866
There it is!

25:08.966 --> 25:10.133
There it is.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.344
Here comes a tomato.
Keep your eye on the ball.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.014
- Ooh.
- All right, here we go.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.644
Boom! There it is!

25:23.189 --> 25:24.397
Nice!

25:28.402 --> 25:31.321
Oh! All right, there we go.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.121
- Oh, no!
- Grapefruit.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.415
Yeah!

25:52.343 --> 25:54.453
Produce! Where the heck have you been?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.679
Get a new apron and get back to work!

26:16.116 --> 26:17.935
Hey, Produce, how's it going, man?

26:18.035 --> 26:19.728
- Incredible, man.
- That's great. That's great.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.982
Listen, if you tell anyone
what you just saw...

26:23.082 --> 26:24.525
there's going to be
some problems for you.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.361
But you took the bottle.

26:27.461 --> 26:29.796
- It's not yours.
- I know.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.824
The thing is,
I'd pay for it if I was 21...

26:31.924 --> 26:34.133
but I'm not, so I can't.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.870
- Understand?
- Understand.

26:35.970 --> 26:38.164
- All right.
- Hey, speed demon.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.541
- Mr. Jenkins, how are you, sir?
- Great, great.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.334
Hey, I caught your race
last Saturday night.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.545
- Oh, thank you.
- So when are they going to go ahead...

26:44.645 --> 26:46.771
and just let you race in the 500?

26:48.315 --> 26:50.050
Oh, thank you, sir. You're too kind.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.219
Well, keep up the good work, son.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.971
You're making us all proud around here.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.905
Thank you, thank you.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.996
Hey, not a word, you understand me?

27:03.122 --> 27:04.998
- Yeah.
- All right, great.

27:12.172 --> 27:16.175
- Hey, Produce.
- Hey, what are you doing out here?

27:16.302 --> 27:18.537
I was wondering if you wanted
to go somewhere with me.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.414
Where do we want to go?

27:20.514 --> 27:22.640
Come on. It'll be a surprise.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.439
- Dang it!
- It's all right.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.107
You just need to concentrate.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.568
You need to keep your eye on the ball.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.946
And I want you to put your elbows in.

27:52.046 --> 27:54.881
Okay, transfer your weight back.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.550
The swing is all in your wrist.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.968
Let's see.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.956
I'm never going to hit a baseball!

28:02.056 --> 28:04.708
You're going to hit a baseball
and be positive!

28:04.808 --> 28:06.001
If you keep telling yourself

28:06.101 --> 28:07.920
that you're never going to hit
a baseball, guess what.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.297
- I won't hit it.
- That's right, exactly.

28:10.397 --> 28:13.467
Baseball is 75% mental.

28:13.567 --> 28:14.692
Trust me.

28:15.986 --> 28:17.888
I remember you hitting
that two-run double...

28:17.988 --> 28:21.240
off of Clemens back in the 2000 ALCS?

28:21.367 --> 28:23.409
Do I know you?

28:23.535 --> 28:25.078
Steve.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.439
Bookerson.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.749
I was out of the league by 2000.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.485
Oh.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.320
Right, it was, uh...

28:33.420 --> 28:34.754
'99.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.216
Hey, Produce, try to swing level.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.161
Do you ever think about
getting back into the game?

28:41.261 --> 28:42.663
Nope.

28:42.763 --> 28:43.956
Well, that's a shame

28:44.056 --> 28:46.667
because I'm the assistant GM
of the Louisville Bats.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.503
We're looking to fill our manager's position
and I'd like it to be a local boy.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.505
You know what?
I got a kid at home that I can't handle.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.424
I don't think I want to be
in charge of 30 more.

28:53.524 --> 28:56.343
Look, you were one of the smartest players
I had ever seen back in...

28:56.443 --> 28:58.429
Hey, don't you get it, Steve?

28:58.529 --> 29:01.098
I wasn't as good as you
or everyone like you thought I was.

29:01.198 --> 29:03.934
I couldn't hack it when it counted
and I don't want to relive that.

29:04.034 --> 29:06.953
Okay? So thank you, but no, thank you.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.190
I just wanted to offer you
the opportunity if you wanted it.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.109
It's a good-paying gig.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.377
But if you got other stuff going on...

29:23.262 --> 29:24.804
Not really.

29:29.268 --> 29:33.813
Look, why don't you stop by the stadium
Sunday evening 6:00 PM.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.841
Sunday at 6:00?

29:35.941 --> 29:38.719
The GM, he'd be excited
to meet you and if you don't like it...

29:38.819 --> 29:40.679
- Okay.
- You can always walk away.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.389
Yeah, I'll... I'll be there.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.724
Great.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.825
I'll count on it.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.662
Hey, you ready?

29:54.751 --> 29:56.195
I had a good day today.

29:56.295 --> 30:00.574
I took this... This kid who, uh...

30:00.674 --> 30:03.744
I don't know, he's...
He's, like, slow or whatever.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.038
Slow or whatever? Like slow like what?

30:06.138 --> 30:08.514
Like can't win a race?
Or slow like retarded?

30:08.974 --> 30:10.641
Yeah, no, he's got Down Syndrome.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.421
I don't know. It was a good day.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.091
He's a happy kid.
He's a good, happy kid.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.426
- Yeah, great.
- That's cool, man.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.220
You know what would make me happy?

30:21.320 --> 30:22.638
If you buy...

30:22.738 --> 30:24.056
How about you buy a round of beer?

30:24.156 --> 30:25.656
That'd make me happy. How about that?

30:36.960 --> 30:39.670
Colt. Colt!

30:44.343 --> 30:46.286
- What are you doing?
- Stay out of this, Katie.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.013
- You need my help, bro?
- No, man, I think I got it.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.797
Hey!

30:56.897 --> 30:59.065
Hey, where do you think
you're going, huh?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.717
What are you doing, Colt?

31:00.817 --> 31:03.470
Stay out of this, Katie.
It's got nothing to do with you.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.239
Listen, man, I told you
to keep your mouth shut.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.074
I got fired today 'cause of you.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.061
- You did something bad.
- What?

31:11.161 --> 31:13.105
What exactly did I do to you?

31:13.205 --> 31:14.648
Huh? Nothing!

31:14.748 --> 31:16.775
I did absolutely nothing to you.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.044
I came to give Mr. Campbell a melon.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.991
This melon?

31:24.091 --> 31:25.951
You came to give
Mr. Campbell this melon?

31:26.051 --> 31:28.620
Yes. Don't break Mr. Campbell's melon!

31:28.720 --> 31:30.831
Colt! Leave him alone, Colt!

31:30.931 --> 31:32.223
Can't you see he's different?

31:39.439 --> 31:41.440
All right, man, you know what?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.234
Take your melon.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.446
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.

32:24.484 --> 32:25.776
Produce.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.447
What are you doing here?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.159
Where's Katie?

32:33.285 --> 32:34.744
She left.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.706
I brought you a melon.

32:40.334 --> 32:42.168
I see that.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.738
Um... that was nice of you.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.505
Does your mama know where you are?

32:47.799 --> 32:49.133
You don't like my melon?

32:51.470 --> 32:53.914
That's not it at all, Produce.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.932
- Thank you for the melon.
- You're welcome.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.672
So... why are you all dirty?

33:01.772 --> 33:03.090
Did you fall off your bike?

33:03.190 --> 33:05.092
- Yes.
- Are you hurt?

33:05.192 --> 33:07.427
- No.
- You okay?

33:07.527 --> 33:09.320
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:13.367 --> 33:14.867
Well...

33:16.703 --> 33:19.038
um...

33:19.164 --> 33:20.539
do you want a ride home?

33:22.167 --> 33:25.878
- You smell funny.
- Yeah, it's, uh...

33:27.381 --> 33:30.049
that's what the French
call eau de Bourbon.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.222
Not funny?

33:38.350 --> 33:41.378
Okay.

33:41.478 --> 33:45.215
Well, I'm going to go, uh, to sleep...

33:45.315 --> 33:46.732
'cause it's real, real late...

33:46.858 --> 33:51.737
and, um, I'll see you
tomorrow or whenever.

33:57.411 --> 34:00.079
- Good-bye.
- Hey, Produce?

34:01.581 --> 34:04.151
Hey.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.403
Thank you for my melon.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.212
You're welcome.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.297
And away he goes.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.674
Oh, he... Produ...

34:27.774 --> 34:29.900
Produce, you forgot your...

34:30.402 --> 34:31.902
Hey...

34:41.079 --> 34:43.023
Hey, Katie bear?

34:43.123 --> 34:44.815
Which, uh... which tie
do you think I should wear?

34:44.916 --> 34:46.275
This one or this one?

34:46.376 --> 34:47.694
- Neither.
- No?

34:47.793 --> 34:49.612
No, you're not much of a tie guy.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.947
Yeah, I guess you're right.

34:52.047 --> 34:53.533
Why are you so dressed up?

34:53.632 --> 34:56.635
Ah, I got that meeting tonight.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.206
The owners of the Bats, you remember?

34:59.306 --> 35:00.999
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.044
- That's awesome, Dad.
- Thanks.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.771
So just call me after
and we can grab dinner to celebrate.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.508
Yeah, okay.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.551
- I'd like that.
- Me, too.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.486
- Well, all right, then, it's a date.
- Okay.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.654
All right.

35:15.781 --> 35:19.158
Mr. Campbell!

35:23.371 --> 35:25.498
You should tell
your mentally challenged friend...

35:25.624 --> 35:27.484
not to come around here anymore.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.528
Produce? Why?

35:29.628 --> 35:30.920
Colt says he's a troublemaker.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.658
He's not a troublemaker.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.342
Colt on the other hand...

35:37.260 --> 35:38.870
Can you open the door for him, please?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.415
Dad, Colt is going
to be here any minute.

35:41.515 --> 35:42.916
Yeah, I don't care about Colt.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.184
Okay, well, just make it quick.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.005
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.815
- Is that for me?
- Yes, it is.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.026
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.763
I got them
from the flowers department...

35:56.863 --> 35:59.198
and they've got plants there, too.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.200
Oh, I'm going to go put them in water.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.701
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.605
Yeah, he's a real troublemaker.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.442
- Hey, big guy.
- Hey, Mr. Campbell.

36:08.542 --> 36:10.527
- How you doing?
- Incredible.

36:10.627 --> 36:13.113
- That's good.
- I left my book here last night.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.906
- And I really need it.
- Yes, you did.

36:15.006 --> 36:18.034
It's exactly where you left it.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.578
- Here you go, big guy.
- Thank you.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.705
Hey, you look sharp. Where you going?

36:21.805 --> 36:23.389
Thanks. I'm going to church.

36:23.515 --> 36:26.251
It practically starts in 17 minutes.

36:26.351 --> 36:29.421
- Practically, huh?
- Look at my watch.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.964
My mama told me...

36:31.064 --> 36:34.259
it has all the whistles
and all the bells.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.970
Yeah, well, I think your mama's right.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.722
It looks like it does.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.614
- It's a beautiful timepiece, Produce.
- Thank you.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.577
Uh, do you want to come
to church with me?

36:46.746 --> 36:48.414
No.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.949
It's been a long time
since someone got me flowers.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.593
- So, thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.931
Hey, Produce, let me ask you a question.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.017
What do you think of that boy?

37:09.185 --> 37:10.962
Well, I think he's arrogant...

37:11.062 --> 37:15.232
and I would love
to give him a karate chop.

37:16.610 --> 37:17.943
Me, too, boy. Me, too.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.238
All right, have a good Sunday.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.309
Uh, well, I don't want to be late.

37:24.409 --> 37:27.953
If I ride my bike, I'll be late.

37:28.079 --> 37:31.358
Can you please give me a ride? Please?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.985
But I've got to go
play golf with my friend.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.154
And then afterwards
I got a real big meeting.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.489
- So...
- I know... I know that.

37:37.589 --> 37:41.467
I do understand that,
but I need a ride, please.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.219
Give me a ride, please.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.474
All right, what time... How... how...

37:48.600 --> 37:50.768
All right, just...

37:55.440 --> 37:58.817
Now I'm going to drop you off,
but I'm not going inside.

37:58.944 --> 38:02.237
Your daughter is extremely sweet.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.657
Yes.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.494
I just wish she came
with an instruction manual.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.956
Why would she come
with an instruction manual?

38:17.170 --> 38:19.281
Oh, crap.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.157
- Ah, man.
- What's the matter, Mr. Campbell?

38:21.257 --> 38:23.827
Uh, nothing.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.303
I had some drinks this morning. Damn it!

38:33.144 --> 38:34.812
Do you have any...

38:36.481 --> 38:38.065
Hey, Mr. Officer.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.761
- Hi, Calvin.
- Hey, Mitch, how you doing?

38:41.861 --> 38:44.598
Good, good. What's, uh...

38:44.698 --> 38:46.099
Wha... what's going on here?

38:46.199 --> 38:47.767
Uh, well...

38:47.867 --> 38:49.603
I'm just, uh...

38:49.703 --> 38:51.370
I'm just teaching the boy how to drive.

38:51.496 --> 38:52.705
- Uh-huh.
- You know?

38:52.831 --> 38:53.940
And he's doing pretty great.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.650
He's just... He's going a little fast.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.611
He doesn't know any better.

38:57.711 --> 38:59.628
Yeah, right, I... right.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.549
Well, uh...

39:03.675 --> 39:06.010
Encouragement helps.

39:08.221 --> 39:11.416
All right, uh, you're...
You're doing a great job here, son.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.587
Just slow it down.
Speed kills, remember that.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.230
Okay. Speed kills. I'll remember that.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.425
Speed kills.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.053
All right.

39:23.153 --> 39:24.554
- You boys have a nice day.
- All right.

39:24.654 --> 39:25.931
- Thanks.
- Be careful.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.364
Thank you, Officer.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.271
Good job.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.315
Good, good.

39:35.415 --> 39:38.068
I think you better drive.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.752
Well...

39:42.422 --> 39:44.089
you're about to drive a car.

39:46.593 --> 39:47.718
Go.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.623
Real slow.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.515
Keep your eyes on the road.

39:54.184 --> 39:57.128
I've never driven a car before.

39:57.228 --> 40:01.023
- I only have a bicycle.
- Well, you're doing good.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.358
This is incredible!

40:06.613 --> 40:09.808
Hey, uh...

40:09.908 --> 40:11.950
so I'm going to be a little late.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.186
Yeah, something came up.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.771
I got to take somebody to church...

40:14.871 --> 40:17.816
and it's taking a little longer
than I thought.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.833
Yeah, I'll see you.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.835
All right, all right.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.908
You can't get past me.
You can't get past me.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.259
You can't get...

40:30.595 --> 40:32.998
Oh, spoiled!

40:33.098 --> 40:35.291
Nice!

40:35.391 --> 40:37.919
All right, all the way. I got him.

40:38.019 --> 40:40.062
Kick it. Do it.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.180
You're coming inside, Mr. Campbell?

40:49.280 --> 40:51.490
Uh... next time.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.021
- Promise?
- I can't promise.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.648
Hey, is this your secret, Produce?

40:58.748 --> 41:01.333
It's no secret, Mr. Campbell.

41:05.547 --> 41:07.490
Well, good luck
at your baseball meeting tonight.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.591
- Thanks, bud.
- You're welcome.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.970
- Have fun at church.
- Thanks.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.224
All right, so who is she?

41:33.324 --> 41:35.018
Who?

41:35.118 --> 41:37.494
This friend you've been
spending all this time with.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.440
The market, church.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.067
Who is she
and can I please see a picture?

41:42.167 --> 41:43.568
Oh, it's not a lady.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.571
I've been hanging out
with that kid, Produce.

41:46.671 --> 41:49.324
- The retarded kid?
- Hey, easy.

41:49.424 --> 41:52.118
It's called Down Syndrome.

41:52.218 --> 41:55.955
I'll tell you something,
you spend a second with this kid...

41:56.055 --> 41:58.416
and you realize
he's just like you and me.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.168
You're a genius.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.545
What's guaranteed
to make people spend money?

42:02.645 --> 42:05.256
The mentally handicapped...
Challenged, whatever you call it.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.258
That's what I need
for my new dealership commercial.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.302
Like you're going to give money...

42:09.402 --> 42:11.721
to the Special Olympics or something
every time you sell a car?

42:11.821 --> 42:13.264
- What are you talking about?
- No, you tool bag.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.433
I want him to star
in my commercial. It's perfect.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.034
Come on, Milt.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.813
Okay, maybe not him,
maybe one of his special buddies will do it.

42:19.913 --> 42:23.233
- Hey, conversation's over.
- Cal.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.610
Come on, man, sales are down.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.712
Do your old buddy Milt
a solid and call the kid.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.282
He won't know the difference.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.118
Maybe he'll do it for free.
You know, he's retarded.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.744
Hey!

42:34.844 --> 42:36.454
I said it's Down Syndrome.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.623
Okay, what are you...

42:38.723 --> 42:40.125
You feeling sorry for him?

42:40.225 --> 42:44.796
No, Milt, I feel sorry for you.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.147
B.S., man, you feel sorry for yourself.

42:48.900 --> 42:52.027
You've been feeling sorry for yourself
since Detroit kicked you off the team.

42:55.365 --> 42:57.892
- What'd you just say to me?
- You heard every word I said.

42:57.992 --> 43:01.146
I'm not going to sit here
and debate some loser...

43:01.246 --> 43:04.373
who can't get over the fact that he was
an embarrassment in the majors.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.752
What, are you going to freeze?

43:09.629 --> 43:11.713
Is your whole life just going to freeze?

43:12.882 --> 43:14.800
Just like you did at home plate?

43:35.905 --> 43:37.682
Mr. Campbell!

43:37.782 --> 43:39.324
Where are you?

43:57.635 --> 43:59.287
Hey!

43:59.387 --> 44:01.372
What are you doing up there?

44:01.472 --> 44:03.833
Produce...

44:03.933 --> 44:05.710
you scared me.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.185
Come on.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.635
Hey, watch your step, Produce.

44:13.735 --> 44:15.553
There's all sorts of...

44:15.653 --> 44:17.195
There's just stuff.

44:19.449 --> 44:21.684
Did you drink that whole bottle?

44:21.784 --> 44:23.243
Not yet.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.085
Now I did.

44:35.131 --> 44:38.785
Are you sure that you are okay,
Mr. Campbell?

44:38.885 --> 44:42.622
I'm okay.
Now that you're here, I'm great.

44:42.722 --> 44:45.291
I got my drinking buddy.

44:45.391 --> 44:49.379
Uh, maybe we can go
to the batting cages...

44:49.479 --> 44:53.231
and be baseball buddies,
not drinking buddies?

44:55.651 --> 44:57.095
You want to be my baseball buddy?

44:57.195 --> 44:59.097
- Yeah, I do.
- Uh, okay.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.474
Here. First lesson...

45:01.574 --> 45:06.020
when you make it to the majors...

45:06.120 --> 45:07.371
'cause you will...

45:10.416 --> 45:13.820
And you're standing at the home plate...

45:13.920 --> 45:16.630
and there's 40,000 people...

45:17.715 --> 45:19.409
cheering for you...

45:19.509 --> 45:21.968
expecting anything...

45:24.180 --> 45:26.139
don't forget to swing the bat.

45:27.475 --> 45:29.335
I know that, Mr. Campbell.

45:29.435 --> 45:31.546
Gah, you knew that.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.439
You know everything, huh?
You're a smart guy.

45:39.612 --> 45:41.639
Okay, answer me this...

45:41.739 --> 45:44.309
Who hit the ball
400 feet on to the roof...

45:44.409 --> 45:47.035
of Stevenson High School
when he was a junior?

45:48.704 --> 45:50.690
Was it you, Mr. Campbell?

45:50.790 --> 45:52.483
Uh, well, it wasn't you, was it?

45:52.583 --> 45:54.569
- No, it wasn't me.
- No, it wasn't you.

45:54.669 --> 45:56.086
Yeah, it was me.

45:57.547 --> 45:58.672
It was me.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.304
I was supposed to be great.

46:10.059 --> 46:13.728
Well, to me, I think you're great.

46:14.063 --> 46:15.564
Well, of course you do!

46:16.649 --> 46:18.900
Of course you do.
You think melons are great.

46:20.778 --> 46:23.598
- I don't like it when you drink.
- You know what?

46:23.698 --> 46:25.350
I don't like it when you drink...

46:25.450 --> 46:26.851
and I don't want to be
your drinking buddy...

46:26.951 --> 46:28.353
and I don't want
to be your baseball buddy.

46:28.453 --> 46:29.270
Do you understand me?

46:29.370 --> 46:32.456
I don't want to be
your buddy anymore. I'm sorry.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.402
I have a meeting I got to go to...

46:36.502 --> 46:38.670
at 6:00 tonight.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.342
It's, like, a really big meeting...

46:45.970 --> 46:49.931
with really big...
Big, important people.

46:56.230 --> 46:58.841
Hey. Toss them up.

46:58.941 --> 47:00.551
I don't think that you should drive.

47:00.651 --> 47:03.346
God, toss up the keys, Produce.

47:03.446 --> 47:05.447
I'll call Miss Katie to pick you up.

47:11.037 --> 47:14.789
- Produce...
- I'll call Miss Katie to pick you up.

47:16.375 --> 47:18.069
I'm going to come down there, Produce.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.545
- No!
- Co... come here! Come here!

47:25.718 --> 47:27.870
Ah, man, Produce.

47:27.970 --> 47:29.554
Produce. Hey!

47:29.847 --> 47:32.015
Hey!

47:32.558 --> 47:34.518
Produce!

47:35.311 --> 47:37.422
Hey.

47:37.522 --> 47:40.842
If I'm late...
I'm walking and if I'm late...

47:40.942 --> 47:42.844
it's your fault.

47:42.944 --> 47:44.986
It's your fault!

48:08.135 --> 48:09.803
Hello?

48:11.764 --> 48:15.251
It's Calvin Campbell.
I'm here for my interview!

48:15.351 --> 48:17.545
I'm late!

48:17.645 --> 48:20.339
Oh, come on! Open the door!

48:20.439 --> 48:22.967
Hey. Hey!

48:23.067 --> 48:25.011
Come on!

48:25.111 --> 48:27.237
Come on!

50:40.329 --> 50:42.440
You were supposed to call me
right after the meeting, Dad.

50:42.540 --> 50:45.526
Katie, it's Officer Minniear.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.695
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

50:47.795 --> 50:49.488
- It's, uh, just...
- What happened?

50:49.588 --> 50:51.616
We found him passed out
in the visitors' dugout at South...

50:51.716 --> 50:55.051
so I need you to come
down here and pick him up.

51:01.100 --> 51:02.392
Here, drink this.

51:03.227 --> 51:04.545
Cal, come on.

51:04.645 --> 51:06.229
Drink this.

51:07.523 --> 51:09.008
- Thanks, Mitch.
- How you feeling?

51:09.108 --> 51:10.942
I don't feel good.

51:13.946 --> 51:15.989
Katie.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.908
No, don't touch me, Calvin!

51:20.411 --> 51:21.745
I'm sorry.

51:23.748 --> 51:26.776
This is the single
most embarrassing moment of my life.

51:26.876 --> 51:28.944
Do you have any idea what it's like...

51:29.044 --> 51:31.072
picking up the man
who calls himself your father...

51:31.172 --> 51:33.991
at the police station drunk as hell?

51:34.091 --> 51:36.619
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

51:36.719 --> 51:37.995
You're not sorry.

51:38.095 --> 51:40.373
You're just a pathetic little man.

51:40.473 --> 51:43.334
You're a pathetic little man
who lives a pathetic little life.

51:43.434 --> 51:46.754
- Don't say that.
- Because it's not true?

51:46.854 --> 51:48.855
Because you know it is.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.608
I'm sorry.

51:54.612 --> 51:57.848
This isn't how I wanted things
to turn out, Katie.

51:57.948 --> 52:01.394
I just want to make sure you know
that I've given up on you.

52:01.494 --> 52:04.496
Ah, Katie, come on.
Your old man's had a rough night.

52:05.790 --> 52:09.292
Don't say that to me, Katie,
'cause you're my little girl.

52:13.088 --> 52:15.048
- I'm sorry.
- Get in the car.

52:30.439 --> 52:32.508
Mitch, Mitch...

52:32.608 --> 52:34.635
Mitch...

52:34.735 --> 52:36.319
I'm sorry.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.103
It's okay.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.981
You can... You can yell at me...

53:29.081 --> 53:30.608
you can scream if you want to.

53:30.708 --> 53:31.833
I deserve it.

53:33.586 --> 53:35.378
Why would I do that?

53:36.755 --> 53:38.798
I already told you I've given up on you.

53:41.302 --> 53:43.788
What can I do to make this better?

53:43.888 --> 53:46.457
Now you tell me what to do, Katie.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.542
What can I do?

53:48.642 --> 53:50.226
Nothing.

53:51.645 --> 53:53.146
Katie.

54:56.085 --> 54:57.835
Produce.

55:00.756 --> 55:03.325
Hi, Mr. Campbell.

55:03.425 --> 55:05.093
Hey, kid.

55:07.221 --> 55:09.206
Did you make it to your meeting?

55:09.306 --> 55:12.084
Uh... no.

55:12.184 --> 55:13.977
No, I didn't.

55:18.357 --> 55:22.177
Yeah, it's probably better
that you did not go.

55:22.277 --> 55:24.654
You... you're probably right.

55:28.450 --> 55:30.311
So, are you still mad at me...

55:30.411 --> 55:32.313
for taking your keys?

55:32.413 --> 55:34.122
No.

55:38.002 --> 55:41.337
So, are you here to shop for groceries?

55:42.923 --> 55:44.340
Come here.

55:46.635 --> 55:48.386
I'm sorry.

56:13.078 --> 56:15.773
God grant me the serenity...

56:15.873 --> 56:18.943
to accept the things I cannot change...

56:19.043 --> 56:21.779
the courage to change
the things I can...

56:21.879 --> 56:24.338
and the wisdom to know the difference.

56:31.388 --> 56:32.722
Come on in.

56:38.228 --> 56:41.230
Uh... sorry.

56:47.071 --> 56:50.474
Hi, I'm Amy, and I'm an alcoholic.

56:50.574 --> 56:52.810
Hi, Amy.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.562
Tonight's meeting is a closed meeting.

56:55.662 --> 56:58.748
Anyone who has a desire
to stop drinking is welcome to stay.

57:00.250 --> 57:01.876
Any newcomers?

57:05.881 --> 57:07.381
Uh...

57:09.259 --> 57:11.829
Please stand up and introduce yourself.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.597
We'd like to welcome you.

57:18.602 --> 57:21.354
Hi, uh...

57:25.234 --> 57:27.860
My name is Calvin Campbell.

57:29.446 --> 57:31.682
And, uh...

57:31.782 --> 57:33.517
I live here...

57:33.617 --> 57:35.644
St. Matthews.

57:35.744 --> 57:37.870
And, um...

57:39.456 --> 57:41.457
I have a daughter.

57:43.919 --> 57:45.878
She's 17.

57:47.881 --> 57:51.827
Who I... I love her more than anything.

57:51.927 --> 57:53.678
And, um...

57:57.933 --> 57:59.642
Yeah, that's about it.

58:01.979 --> 58:03.756
- Hi, Calvin.
- Hi, Calvin.

58:03.856 --> 58:05.314
Hi.

58:07.401 --> 58:08.886
Thank you.

58:08.986 --> 58:12.473
Um, just for future...

58:12.573 --> 58:14.183
first name only is fine.

58:14.283 --> 58:16.769
That's kind of the anonymous part.

58:16.869 --> 58:18.270
And, um...

58:18.370 --> 58:20.814
it's customary to state
that you're an alcoholic.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.691
That part is...

58:22.791 --> 58:24.500
self-explanatory.

58:26.211 --> 58:30.032
All right, tonight I'll be reading
from step three.

58:30.132 --> 58:31.742
"Made a decision
to turn our will and lives...

58:31.842 --> 58:35.178
over to the care of God
as we understood Him."

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.581
what?

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.043
Do you love me, Colt?

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.739
You don't love me.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.882
Why would you even say that?

01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:05.805
If you loved me, we'd be in the backseat
right now and I'd be hitting it.

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.393
Prick.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:13.672
What did you just say to me?

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:16.883
- Nothing.
- All right, get out of my car, Katie.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.719
What?

01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:21.096
I'm not doing this baby stuff
with you anymore.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:23.489
I'm over it, all right? Get out.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:26.143
- You know what? You are a prick.
- Yeah, and you know what?

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.062
You're not hot enough for me
to be trying this hard anymore.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:30.579
Get out.

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:05.057
- Hello?
- Hey.

01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:09.853
- Hey, you okay?
- Uh, will you come pick me up?

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:13.190
- Yeah.
- I would have called someone else, but...

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.860
- I'm behind the Valumarket.
- What are you doing there?

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.197
Well, Colt wanted to go somewhere
that we could be alone.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.366
I... just please come get me?

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.284
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:26.302
I'm coming to get you right now.
I'll be right there.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:46.113
- Hey, Miss Katie.
- Hi, Produce.

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.476
I probably look silly
just standing out here

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:51.076
all by myself in the dark.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.938
Are you cold?

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:55.232
Yeah, but won't you be cold?

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.707
No.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:00.711
Thank you.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.131
I think you look beautiful.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:08.636
- Well, you're very sweet.
- You're welcome.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:14.668
Produce, listen to me.

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.227
I need you to go back inside, okay?

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.633
Produce, go back inside.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.093
What are you doing here?

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.428
No, leave him alone.
He didn't do anything.

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:26.737
Listen, I don't care about the 'tard,
I'm talking to you.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.350
I came back to apologize, Katie.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:31.992
I'm sorry for what I said earlier.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:45.923
Damn, you drunk again, Mr. Campbell?

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:51.136
- You touch either one of them...
- Oh, you'll what?

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.460
Go home.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.018
We're over, Colt.

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:02.466
Okay. Fine.

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:04.149
Have it your way.

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:07.804
Hey.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:10.030
Thanks for coming.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.976
I'm trying, Katie.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.952
- I'm trying.
- I know.

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:17.955
- Thanks, Dad.
- And you...

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:20.984
thank you...

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:22.694
for protecting my daughter.

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:24.321
You're welcome.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.589
I wish there was something
we could do to repay you.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.523
We're going to leave
in a couple of minutes.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.233
So what did you guys think
of the service?

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:02.984
Well, I mean, she liked it.

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:05.737
She was smiles and, uh, I liked it.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:07.197
Think you guys will make it back?

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.199
I don't know. You know?

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:12.202
It's been a long time since
I've darkened the doorway of a, uh...

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:13.787
Of a church?

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:16.540
Yeah, of a church.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.376
I just... you know.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.686
I haven't had much faith
in anything in a long time.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.884
I hear you.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.735
- Yeah.
- How's everything else been going?

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.364
One day at a time.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.658
That's right.

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:38.853
Hey, um, can we...

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:41.455
Can I take you to get some coffee or...

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.335
Yeah.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:49.505
Yeah, you got coffee.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.700
- Hey, Katie.
- You ready to go?

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.160
I am. Uh, Katie, this is Miss Amy.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.829
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:58.081
- Nice to meet you.
- It's really nice to meet you.

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.708
I've heard a lot about you.

01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:01.543
Oh, well, hopefully all good.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:02.877
- Sometimes.
- Thanks.

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:04.212
- Definitely all good.
- Thank you.

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:06.464
Okay.

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.967
- Okay.
- All right.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:11.761
- Bye. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.513
- Come on, Dad.
- Come back.

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:15.989
- We will.
- I'll see you later.

01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:39.596
You swing with your club face open.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:41.916
What do you know?

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:44.727
You swing a club
worse than you swing a bat.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.858
Did you just come here
to mock my golf game?

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.488
I came here to apologize.

01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:00.935
Cal, the things I said to you, man,
everything I said...

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:04.455
Hey, what you said was true
and I needed to hear it.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:13.615
- Missed you, buddy.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:14.658
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:15.700
You should be sorry.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.050
It was a cheap shot.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.595
Let's get out of here. Let's get a beer.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.209
How about we make it a coffee?

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:27.352
- A coffee?
- AA.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.648
You're not an alcoholic, Cal.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.318
I am.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:36.944
I'm an alcoholic.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.935
Okay, happy hour. Two for one.

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:43.660
Two for me, none for you.

01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:06.667
- Hey, Dexter.
- Hey, what's up, Calvin?

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:08.002
How you doing?

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:10.046
So today is the day that you announce...

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.881
the Employee of the Month, right?

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:17.886
- Yeah, why?
- Well, um, have you considered Produce?

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.724
- He's a hard worker.
- Now, Cal, I have a soft spot...

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.225
- in my heart for that young man.
- Yeah, I know.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:23.768
That's why I hired him the first time.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.812
He's a good boy. He's a good guy.

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:28.064
Now... now, look, Cal.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:30.358
Now, Produce ain't got
the sense God gave a cucumber.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.402
Now, I got to give that award
to employee that represent...

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.903
what this supermarket is about.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.904
This ain't no YMCA
where everybody gets a trophy.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.907
Okay, and with all due respect...

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:41.493
I think that Produce is probably
the hardest-working employee that you have.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:44.456
I mean he knows the name
and the SKU number, the code or whatever...

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.291
to every piece of fruit
and vegetable over in your...

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.084
- Now, Cal.
- ...section over there.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.377
Just because the boy's a retard,
he don't get no special treatment.

01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:52.171
- You know better than that, man.
- You know what?

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:54.674
We don't use the "R" word
just like we don't use the "N" word.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.384
You know?

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:58.861
We should be clear
on our word choice, Dexter.

01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:18.130
Let's get out of here.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.366
Hey.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.217
Want to go have some fun?

01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:24.761
Let's go.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:39.803
Well, do you guys want
to hit the go-karts?

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:41.805
- Go-karts? Do we?
- Yeah! I'll do the go-karts.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:44.599
We were made to hit
the go-karts, Produce.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:46.033
Made.

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.619
Born to ride!

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:40.796
There you go.

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:50.206
You're making this hard on me, Milt.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.417
Come on, don't be soft.

01:11:52.517 --> 01:11:54.685
They call that enabling.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:57.672
It's called testing.
Good job, you passed.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:59.773
These are actually both for me.

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:04.987
- Where's your family at?
- Franklin's dropping them off.

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:10.158
Yeah. We're playing house.

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:27.160
- All right, give me a sip.
- Really?

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.637
Yeah, just a sip, a taste,
to knock off the edge.

01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:32.973
Are you sure about this?

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.101
One sip.

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.687
I've been real, real good.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.650
Ah, come on.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.845
I may have lost my drinking buddy...

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:48.196
but I still got to look out
for my best friend.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:51.059
Besides, the beer was terrible.
Tasted stale.

01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:53.478
- Did it?
- No.

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:54.995
I just remembered I had this.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:59.541
I don't want a sip of that.

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:04.880
Yeah.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:08.117
Look who we found, Mr. Campbell.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.135
Produce wanted me
to come have pizza with him.

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:14.499
- Amy.
- Hi, I'm Milt Malcolm.

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:17.502
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- How are you? Nice to meet you.

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:18.351
Nice work.

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:22.048
Oh, cavalry has arrived.
Excuse me, folks.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.300
See ya, buddy.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.151
All right, come on, let's go.

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:29.738
- Let's go.
- Come on.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.159
I'll be right there.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:40.999
Thank you so much.

01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:44.377
It means a lot.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.969
I... I'm sorry.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:03.131
Milt.

01:14:03.231 --> 01:14:04.773
Milt!

01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:08.344
Listen, that... That wasn't anything...

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.112
I'm not listening to you!

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.450
You're killing me. You're killing me!

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.986
Hey, Produce,
you want to go play some games?

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:26.487
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:27.989
- Bye.
- See ya later.

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.339
Wait...

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:31.758
- Wait...
- We just got ditched.

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:35.470
Yeah, I think your daughter
just stole him from me.

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:41.518
- Hi.
- How you doing?

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.273
I'm good, yeah.

01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:49.526
Nice.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:52.930
Come on, go get a pizza.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.974
- Pizza.
- Talking your language?

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.575
That's unique.

01:15:00.288 --> 01:15:02.581
I know how to do this. I love laser tag.

01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:04.666
Thanks.

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:08.837
Hey! We're on the same team, remember?

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.507
Hey, Katie.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.538
Come on.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:20.875
- I want to play.
- No, we can play later.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.919
Come on, guys,
it's the last game of the night.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.253
Then we can come back tomorrow.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.214
We're on the same team, remember?

01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:27.731
I'll protect you.

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.136
Oh, my gosh, you got me, man.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:34.639
Come on, guys.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:36.349
It's just a silly game of laser tag.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:39.159
- Come on, Katie, let's beat them!
- Let's go.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:17.598
What?

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:20.643
What do you need to be
so rude for, Katie, huh?

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:21.409
What does that mean?

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.438
- No, Colt. What are you doing?
- Once upon a time.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.983
- I just want to talk.
- Okay, well, I don't want to talk.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.610
- Yeah, you don't need to talk.
- No, you need to put your hands off me.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.904
No, no, listen, I just want you
to lay back down right now.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:33.823
- That's it.
- You're disgusting.

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.825
- Disgusting?
- No, my dad was right about you.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.535
- Oh, my God.
- Stop!

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:40.095
Stop! Get off!

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:43.556
This would be easier if you just...

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:52.175
- Hey, I shot you guys!
- Get out of here, Produce.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:54.886
No! Is that Miss Katie?

01:16:54.986 --> 01:16:56.679
- Get out of here!
- Shut up, Katie!

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.071
- No!
- Now!

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:04.035
Shut up!

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.023
Will you shut up?

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.999
Shut up. Come on, shut up!

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.209
- Dad!
- Yeah?

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:27.418
Dad, please come help. Hurry!

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:28.878
What's wrong, baby? What's wrong?

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:31.672
Produce hit Colt and it's really bad.

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.106
What?

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:42.808
Oh, no.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:45.561
Hey, should you call 911?

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.746
Yeah.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:50.874
What did you do, Produce?

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.987
- You're not proud of me?
- No, I'm not proud of you!

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:58.741
You cannot hit somebody
with a fire extinguisher!

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.660
I mean, are you... Are you crazy?

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.161
I thought we'd be like brothers!

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.080
You go call your mom right now!

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.514
And you bring her here, Produce.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:10.503
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:12.797
He was just trying
to protect me from Colt.

01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:13.798
Wh... what do you mean?

01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:15.357
I don't know what would
have happened if he didn't...

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:17.969
Oh, baby.

01:18:18.069 --> 01:18:21.138
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:22.614
I'm sorry.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:25.768
Now is he going to be all right?

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:28.187
Once he gets treated,
we'll take him in...

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:30.356
and interview him, find out
a little bit more about what happened.

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:32.191
- Okay.
- Where's the kid?

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:34.568
Obviously, we'll need to talk to him.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:37.655
We don't know. Um, he just took off.

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:40.741
Okay, I'll send some officers to...
To go look for him.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:43.160
Is he going to be in trouble? Produce?

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.621
I don't foresee that.
I think it's, uh...

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.373
We just need to ask him some questions.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.458
Find out a little bit more about...
About what went on.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.585
All right, well, it's my fault,
so I'm going to get in the car...

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:53.004
and I'm just going to go look for him.

01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:55.464
All right, I'm going to stay here
and see if I can get ahold of him.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.216
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll go with you.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:59.010
- Thank you, Officer.
- Certainly.

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:01.986
- Let us know if you find out anything.
- Absolutely.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:13.149
We can't just be
driving around blindly...

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:14.775
looking for him all night.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:18.070
- We have no choice.
- Yeah, we do.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.989
I think I'm going to take you home.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:22.575
Maybe just wait for him there.
Maybe he'll show up at the house.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.452
No, he's not going
to show up at the house, Dad.

01:19:24.552 --> 01:19:26.428
And I'd rather be with you right now.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.450
What does Milt want?

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:51.854
Hey, buddy boy, what do you need?

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.315
Let's meet up, man. Let's meet up.

01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:56.901
No, I can't right now.
Katie and I are looking for Produce.

01:19:57.001 --> 01:19:59.111
- We're just driving around.
- I talked with him.

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:02.865
- Can't do that right now.
- Frank, he said he wasn't sleeping with her.

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:04.784
She wanted to.

01:20:04.884 --> 01:20:06.509
I believe him, man. Oh, jeez!

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:13.626
Hey! Milt?

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:16.478
Hey, answer me! Milt!

01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:40.569
Hey. Hey, Amy.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.405
Hey, is Produce okay?

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:44.073
No, not good.

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:46.200
- Are you his father?
- Uh, no. Uh-uh.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.411
Dr. Jones wants to speak
to his next of kin...

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:49.745
to discuss what's going
to be happening today.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.872
All right, we'll call his mother.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:54.807
No, she died over a year ago.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:57.795
What?

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:00.423
He talks about her all the time.

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:03.384
I know. I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.386
I thought you knew.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:07.012
Ho... ho... Hold on a second.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:09.598
So you're telling me
that he lives all on his own?

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:13.936
Even... even with his...
With... with his condition?

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:16.063
Yeah.

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:18.065
Does that really surprise you?

01:21:18.165 --> 01:21:21.902
The patient with DS is...
Really wants a book or his book...

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:23.571
Let me talk to him. I'll talk to him.

01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:25.573
I'm sorry. I'm only allowed
to have family back there.

01:21:25.673 --> 01:21:28.868
- Please.
- Ma'am, we are the only family that he has.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:32.121
Okay? Amy, do you mind
sticking with Katie?

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.081
- I got it. Thank you.
- Where is he?

01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:36.057
Thank you very much.

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:42.715
Hey. Hey.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:46.552
Oh...

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:48.345
Hey, buddy.

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:51.140
How you doing, Produce?

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.701
Hey, Produce, how you doing?

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:59.315
- Hurts so bad.
- Yeah.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.108
I bet you do.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:05.529
Hey, I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:07.156
Okay?

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:08.866
Back at that laser tag place...

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:12.828
I... I realize you were
just trying to protect Katie.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:15.414
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:18.125
You're welcome, Mr. Campbell.

01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:20.059
I'm sorry, Cal.

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:25.257
- I want to have my book.
- You want your book?

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:27.108
Yes.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:31.654
- You want your book?
- Yes.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:35.684
Oh, you want your book!
I'm going to go get your book.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.479
I'll be right back. Hey.

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:40.830
Your wife is on her way.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.411
- Hey, darling.
- Hey, Dad.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.205
Hey, sweetheart, will you run
to the car real quick...

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:57.915
and grab Produce's Bible for me?

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.417
- Hi. How are you doing?
- I'm fine. Fine.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:02.169
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:04.755
I just saw Milt. He looks good.

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:08.509
He's going to be all right.
Want to go back and see him?

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:12.263
Actually, um, I'm not sure
he wants to see me.

01:23:12.363 --> 01:23:14.723
Okay.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:17.226
I mean, I think... I think
that he would want to see you.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.576
You sure?

01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:22.398
You know, I don't want
to get him all worked up.

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:23.899
- Okay.
- So...

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:26.277
Okay. Okay. You okay?

01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:28.419
Yeah.

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:36.579
Hey, here's the book
I got that you asked for.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.497
It's not for me.

01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:40.765
What are you...
What are you talking about?

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.895
It's for him.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.806
We're looking at blunt trauma
to the left upper abdomen...

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:58.934
ruptured spleen, severe internal bleeding,
and hypertension.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.978
Should I order
an exploratory laparotomy?

01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:03.564
No time. Make sure we're prepped
for a splenectomy, stat.

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:05.248
I don't want to lose this kid.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.000
Okay.

01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:12.197
Mr. Campbell.

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:14.507
You're going to be
all right, kid, I promise.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.208
Please don't leave me here.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:26.394
Hey, I'm right here, Milt.

01:24:28.939 --> 01:24:30.732
I'm right here, pal.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.611
Look what the kid gave you.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:42.227
- He's a good kid.
- Yeah.

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:46.398
- I'm scared, Cal.
- Hey, hey.

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:47.957
You're going to be all right.

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:56.659
My mom used to do that
back when I was a kid...

01:24:56.759 --> 01:24:58.509
Read me the Bible.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.138
I used to like Matthew.

01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:05.224
I can't remember why.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.718
Hey, Sue?

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:16.360
Come on.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:32.502
All right. Huh? Pick up.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:43.872
"...who are weary and burdened.

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.708
And I will give you rest.

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:48.711
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me.

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:50.879
For I am gentle and humble in heart..."

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.272
- We need to get him into surgery now.
- "...and you will find rest..."

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.635
Give me another set of retractors.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:58.528
I see some bleeding in the left kidney.

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:05.060
Get two units of blood, stat!

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.161
More suction!

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.999
There you go. Bring that in closer.

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:42.280
Hey, thanks.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.870
What did you say?

01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:52.874
- When?
- When you prayed.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:56.377
I don't know.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:00.798
I said a prayer, too.

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:05.094
That was the first time
I've actually prayed.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:07.623
Yeah?

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:09.390
Me, too.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:15.506
I-I asked that Milt
and Produce will be okay.

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:18.399
- Do you think it'll happen?
- I hope so.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.528
I hope so.

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:28.409
But I don't know if that's the way
it works, sweetheart.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:33.080
Well, then, what good is it to pray
if you don't get what you ask for?

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:40.922
Okay.

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:49.039
Growing up, did I get you everything
that you ever asked for?

01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:51.432
- Of course not.
- No.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.379
But I love you so much...

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:59.466
and I want you to have
everything that you want...

01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:01.510
but sometimes it's not
in your best interest...

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:05.780
or it's just, uh...
It's just a hard decision.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:09.533
It's not fair.

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:13.120
I'm saying that God...

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:16.749
is probably not a genie...

01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:21.530
you know, that's granting
every wish or...

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.589
I don't know. I don't know.

01:28:26.259 --> 01:28:27.995
Maybe you're right.

01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:30.471
I hope that you get
what you asked for tonight.

01:28:31.682 --> 01:28:33.808
Thanks, Dad.

01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:35.752
He's crashing! Come on!

01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:37.603
Doctor, get that off of the paper.

01:28:40.023 --> 01:28:42.191
Get two units of blood!

01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:46.638
Probing.

01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:48.698
Where's the CO2?

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:57.900
You know, it's in moments like these...

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.278
I'm reminded of one profound truth.

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:03.071
Life is short.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.616
And it's meant
to be lived with courage...

01:29:05.716 --> 01:29:08.243
and not laden with fear.

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:10.579
And you have to decide...

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:13.999
are your dreams bigger
than your memories?

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:17.336
Or will you stay stuck in the past?

01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:21.590
Life is meant to be lived.
Lived abundantly.

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.134
You know, you look around
this cemetery, you see there are...

01:29:24.234 --> 01:29:27.471
There are two dates on every tombstone.

01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:30.098
There's a birthdate
and there is a date of death.

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.309
Every human being...

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:35.145
is guaranteed those two dates...

01:29:35.245 --> 01:29:36.939
but that little dash...

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:39.191
that lies in between
those two numbers...

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:41.568
that's what defines our life.

01:29:41.668 --> 01:29:44.529
So make your dash count.

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:47.798
Live. Really live.

01:30:26.129 --> 01:30:27.990
Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome...

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:30.409
our new Louisville Bats manager,
Calvin Campbell...

01:30:30.509 --> 01:30:33.511
who will now take the mound
to throw out the first pitch.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.647
Wow.

01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:02.315
I want to dedicate this first pitch...

01:31:02.415 --> 01:31:04.026
to someone very important to me...

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:08.363
uh, who's not able to be here
with us tonight because...

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.532
well...

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:13.326
his life ended way too soon.

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:14.802
Produce...

01:31:17.556 --> 01:31:19.098
can I have a ball, please?

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.885
Yeah! Ha-ha!

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:31.443
That's my boy! Ha-ha!

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:35.656
- Knock 'em down, man.
- Thanks.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:38.742
This one's for Milt.

01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:04.086
Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce!

01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:07.714
Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce!

01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:09.440
Produce! Produce!

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:44.350
Produce, where the heck have you been?

01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:48.562
I don't know.
