00:37.640 --> 00:38.961
Victor, I don't know that it's...

00:39.000 --> 00:40.889
Mom, you have to
wear the glasses.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.964
- It's 3D, honey.
- Yes, Of course.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.447
So that's where my candlestick went.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.682
Isn't that your
grandmother's tablecloth?

00:52.760 --> 00:53.841
Yeah.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.290
- That looks great.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.366
Whoa! I just felt
like I was attacked!

01:03.760 --> 01:05.683
Send in the marines!

01:14.600 --> 01:16.602
<i>Over here, men! This way!</i>

01:17.920 --> 01:19.251
- Oh!
- Whoa!

01:19.320 --> 01:20.480
Watch out!

01:22.840 --> 01:25.366
- - Sparky!
- Sparky, that's you!

01:30.800 --> 01:32.643
You tell them, Sparky.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.882
Whoo!

01:46.840 --> 01:47.880
Oh, my!

01:49.640 --> 01:51.290
- Bravo!

01:52.120 --> 01:53.326
- Oh!
- Oh, Oh!

01:53.800 --> 01:54.881
- Oh!

01:55.040 --> 01:56.451
- Um...
- Oh!

01:56.520 --> 01:57.521
Maybe just unplug it.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.644
Well, it certainly was exciting.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.080
Yeah, it was a big finish. Well done, son.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.043
I can fix this. Come on, boy.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.123
All that time he spends up there.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.646
A boy his age
needs to be outside with his friends.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.167
I don't know that Victor has friends,
dear. Other than Sparky.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.681
That's my point.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.764
I don't want him to turn out,
you know, weird.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.204
There's nothing wrong with Victor.
He's just in his own world.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.211
Easy, boy.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.723
See you later, sweetie.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.410
Have a good day.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.562
Victor! Come on, honey.
You're going to be late.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.165
Go put Sparky in the back yard.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.205
Come on, Sparky!

04:15.000 --> 04:16.843
Good morning, Mr. Burgemeister.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.208
Your dog has been
sniffing around my Dutch Dazzlers.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.923
The other day
I caught him peeing on my flamingo.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.521
I'll keep an eye on him.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.761
You better.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.521
Yes, sir.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.283
Go on, Sparky. That's right!

04:39.520 --> 04:41.966
Good boy. See you later!

04:55.520 --> 04:57.010
Where do you think you're going?

04:57.520 --> 04:58.567
School.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.128
What about that dog of yours?

05:01.200 --> 05:04.170
She's not in the house
and she's away from your tulips.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.648
I want you to remember something.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.566
While your parents are away,
I am in charge here.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.331
Yes, Uncle Bob.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.808
Dutch Day is coming up,
and I don't need any trouble.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.406
- How's your song coming?
- Okay.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.291
Keep at it!

05:20.360 --> 05:23.603
Dutch Day is a big day for me.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.966
Yes, sir.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.249
Good morning, children.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.324
I am Mr. Rzykruski.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.568
I will be your new science teacher.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.125
Apparently, Mr. Holcomb
had an incident.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.448
He got hit by lightning!

05:47.720 --> 05:49.688
Well, that is bad.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.162
But he did not get "hit" by lightning.

05:53.240 --> 05:58.565
Lightning does not hit a person the way
one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.644
Lightning is simply electricity.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.607
The cloud is angry. Yes. Making storm.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.482
All the electrons are saying,
"I am leaving you!"

06:11.680 --> 06:14.684
"I go to the land of opportunity!"

06:14.760 --> 06:15.886
The ground says,

06:15.960 --> 06:20.488
"Yes, we need electrons
trained in science just like you!"

06:20.680 --> 06:23.490
"Come. Come! Welcome."

06:24.320 --> 06:26.891
So both sides start to build a ladder.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.842
This man, he comes out
to look at the storm.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.521
He does not see the invisible ladders.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.206
When the two ladders meet... Boom!

06:37.480 --> 06:38.766
The circuit is complete

06:38.840 --> 06:42.561
and all of the electrons rush
to the land of opportunity.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.121
This man is in the way!

06:45.520 --> 06:46.601
Ahh!

06:50.560 --> 06:54.007
But it is very rare
to have such an incident.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.604
But it's not rare.

06:56.680 --> 07:00.082
Lightning happens
to people all the time here.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.766
There's a thunderstorm
almost every night.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.490
My dad got hit twice.

07:04.840 --> 07:09.323
They built New Holland
on an abandoned gold mine.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.289
I heard it was a cemetery.

07:11.360 --> 07:15.524
That's where they buried the miners.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.166
It's the windmill that does it.

07:20.640 --> 07:27.171
Turning, turning the air until
the sky itself rages against the night.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.970
No. Cemetery. Definitely.

08:49.080 --> 08:54.928
Students, on your way out, take
a permission slip for the science fair.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.602
First prize is a huge trophy!

09:10.120 --> 09:11.770
- Hello, Victor.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.481
Hi.

09:13.560 --> 09:17.565
Mr. Whiskers had
a dream about you last night.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.286
How do you know?

09:19.640 --> 09:22.644
Because this morning he made this.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.161
Oh.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.926
Did you get that out of the litter box?

09:29.320 --> 09:31.448
It's an omen.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.004
Last month he dreamed about Bob.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.764
He fell in a manhole.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.968
He dreamed about Toshiaki

09:45.520 --> 09:49.002
the day he pitched a perfect game.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.368
And Nassor the day
he got knocked unconscious.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.526
If Mr. Whiskers dreams about you,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.163
it means something big
is going to happen.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.764
You can keep it.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.883
One day you'll dream about me,
won't you, Kitty?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.882
Hey, boy. How are you doing?

10:39.040 --> 10:41.247
You'll be my partner, right, Victor?

10:41.480 --> 10:43.687
Because you have to have a partner
for the science fair,

10:43.840 --> 10:45.842
and whoever is your
partner is going to win.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.481
You know the most about science
so pick me as a partner.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.642
I have lots of ideas!

10:52.240 --> 10:54.049
We can make a death ray!

10:55.240 --> 10:57.049
It says no death rays. See?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.080
Oh, man.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.528
I still want to do it. Come on.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.365
Who else would be your partner?

11:03.600 --> 11:05.967
You don't have friends and neither do I.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.003
I'm sorry, Edgar.
I just don't need a partner.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.244
I like to work alone.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.001
Will you sign
my permission slip?

11:19.040 --> 11:20.401
Dinner's ready.

11:22.360 --> 11:25.284
Victor, have I ever talked to you
about what I do for a living?

11:25.520 --> 11:26.681
You're a travel agent?

11:27.040 --> 11:28.530
I sell dreams.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.048
I tell people, "You can sail to Italy."

11:32.200 --> 11:34.123
"You can do the hula in Hawaii."

11:34.880 --> 11:37.611
- Will you sign my form?
- I'm getting to that.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.281
Okay.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.442
In my job, sometimes you have people

11:41.520 --> 11:44.046
who don't want quite
the same thing, right?

11:44.520 --> 11:47.126
Say a husband wants to
play golf in Scotland

11:47.200 --> 11:50.488
but the wife wants to
paddle down the Amazon.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.122
All right, you've got two
conflicting ideas here.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.490
And it's my job, Victor,
to help them meet halfway.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.644
Say... Scottsdale, Arizona.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.280
He gets to golf, she gets Indians.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.886
But there's no river. And no jungle.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.611
- Nobody gets what they want.
- Exactly.

12:10.800 --> 12:11.881
And wrong.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.971
They both get what they want
because they compromise.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.006
You'd like to do the science fair
and that's great.

12:19.080 --> 12:23.165
I'd like you to try a sport.
Say, I don't know, baseball.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.886
Science fair, baseball.
Science fair, baseball.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.366
How do you choose?
Guess what? You don't have to.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.688
No reason you can't do both.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.320
You meet in the middle.
Everyone's happy.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.685
Look at what Toshiaki's doing.

12:44.760 --> 12:49.243
He's keeping his eye on the target,
never losing his concentration.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.728
Strike three! Next batter!

12:59.640 --> 13:04.282
I want you to concentrate
on your project for the science fair.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.520
Come on, honey!

13:14.920 --> 13:16.684
Whoa. Nice catch, Sparky.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.966
Come on, Victor, please.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.327
Tie Sparky up and get
your head into the game.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.606
Time out!

13:24.320 --> 13:25.481
Sorry, boy.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.525
Hey, Sparky.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.400
Play ball!

13:38.760 --> 13:40.171
Strike one!

13:40.280 --> 13:41.486
Nice try, son.

13:42.480 --> 13:46.371
When conducting an experiment,
trying is the important thing.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.247
It is okay to fail
as long as you keep trying!

13:52.600 --> 13:53.647
Eh?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.841
Come on, Victor. You can do it, honey.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.403
- Strike two!

14:09.760 --> 14:10.761
Yes!

14:10.880 --> 14:12.405
Come on, honey!

14:44.880 --> 14:46.006
Victor, run!

14:51.320 --> 14:52.287
Sparky!

15:19.480 --> 15:20.606
Sparky!

15:25.760 --> 15:29.446
No!

16:21.160 --> 16:23.811
He was a great dog. A great friend.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.248
The best dog a kid could have.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.849
When you lose someone you love,
they never really leave you.

16:31.080 --> 16:34.050
They just move into
a special place in your heart.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.088
He'll always be there, Victor.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.840
I don't want him in my heart.
I want him here with me.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.886
I know.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.200
If we could bring him back, we would.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.681
Try and get some sleep, sweetheart.
Things will seem better in the morning.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.451
Just like lightning,
the nervous system is electricity.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.884
We are wires and springs and cables
to send the messages.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.001
Even after death, the wiring remains.

18:18.240 --> 18:23.087
Watch as the muscles
respond to the electricity.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.401
Hi, Victor! How was school?

19:18.080 --> 19:19.241
Okay.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.925
- Shoo!

26:38.800 --> 26:40.484
I'm sorry, boy.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.885
You're alive!

27:10.280 --> 27:11.566
You're alive!

27:12.040 --> 27:13.644
- Sparky!

27:13.720 --> 27:15.085
You're alive!

27:15.160 --> 27:17.401
I can't believe it! You're alive!

27:24.040 --> 27:25.405
I can fix that.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.486
It worked.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.811
It really worked.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.046
Victor!

27:41.600 --> 27:43.250
Victor, breakfast!

27:48.240 --> 27:49.480
Victor?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.325
Are you up here?

27:55.480 --> 27:56.766
- Shh.

27:57.680 --> 27:58.966
Quiet down, boy.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.080
Victor?

28:04.360 --> 28:05.850
Sparky, Shh!

28:06.440 --> 28:07.441
Quiet.

28:07.920 --> 28:08.921
Victor!

28:23.240 --> 28:24.890
Shh!

28:27.960 --> 28:29.883
French toast or waffles?

28:30.680 --> 28:31.681
Uh, waffles.

28:31.760 --> 28:34.047
Then I'll need my waffle iron back,
Mr. Director.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.690
It's my science project. It's a robot.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.966
- A robotic bucket?
- Yes.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.006
- For mopping, I suppose?
- Yes.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.211
Maybe when you're finished,
you'll let me use it.

29:07.880 --> 29:11.168
Sorry, boy, but I can't let
anyone know about you.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.085
They may not understand.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.083
So, you need to stay here today.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.450
No, couldn't be.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.521
What?

31:16.560 --> 31:18.483
I know. And Helen said
she thought they were

31:18.560 --> 31:21.928
putting up some
kind of TV antenna on top of the roof.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.971
In the middle
of a thunderstorm?

31:24.040 --> 31:25.246
That's what she said.

31:25.440 --> 31:26.851
I don't believe it.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.564
And did you get
that big power surge the other night?

31:32.720 --> 31:34.688
Jack thought it was a fuse box,

31:34.840 --> 31:37.650
but apparently it affected
the whole neighborhood.

31:37.800 --> 31:41.088
Sometimes I wonder
just what goes on in that house.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.208
I just don't feel safe walking by there.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.643
Sweetie, you okay? Here you go.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.282
So anyway, Jack loves it here,

31:55.360 --> 31:56.800
but if the schools weren't so great,

31:56.840 --> 31:59.650
sometimes I wonder
if we'd be better off closer to my mother.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.604
Sparky?

32:18.200 --> 32:19.281
Hmm.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.084
- Hi, Victor. How was school?
- Good. Got to go.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.840
Sparky?

33:33.600 --> 33:34.761
Sparky?

33:36.600 --> 33:37.601
There you are.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.563
Good boy. Sorry you had
to stay here alone all day.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.123
What's the matter, boy? Are you okay?

33:52.560 --> 33:54.050
Hmm. You're a little low.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.041
Are you hungry, boy?

33:57.680 --> 33:59.364
All right, here. Let's top you up.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.891
Victor?
Could you come down here, please?

34:17.960 --> 34:19.085
Victor!

34:19.800 --> 34:21.165
Your friend is here.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.561
Edgar?

34:24.639 --> 34:25.641
Hey.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.531
Edgar, what are you doing here?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.806
- I know.
- What?

34:31.480 --> 34:32.606
I know.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.369
- Know what?
- You know.

34:38.840 --> 34:39.841
No.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.525
I think I know what you know I know.

34:43.120 --> 34:46.966
Look, I don't know what you think
I know, but I don't know it.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.088
Your dog is alive!

34:54.159 --> 34:57.767
That's impossible.
- I know.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.607
I know it is so impossible, but you did it.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.444
You did it!

35:04.600 --> 35:07.843
So, show me how, or I'll tell everyone.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.364
- Oh, Mrs. Frankenstein!
- Shh.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.448
May I have a cookie, please?

35:18.160 --> 35:20.003
Oh. Yes, of course.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.725
All right, come on.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.601
Oh!

35:27.040 --> 35:30.044
I think the wind and the lightning
are part of the same thing,

35:30.120 --> 35:31.724
some kind of strange force.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.122
But the wind isn't strong enough
to bring an animal back from the dead.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.202
For that, you need lightning.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.604
So when can I do it?

35:39.800 --> 35:43.202
You can't. This isn't an experiment.
It's my dog.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.727
Show-and-tell, Victor.

35:47.560 --> 35:50.643
You show me, and I won't tell.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.170
Can I help you, young man?

35:59.240 --> 36:01.242
I'd like to buy a fish.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.970
Certainly. Which one?

36:03.040 --> 36:04.371
This one.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.931
What do we do now?

36:41.600 --> 36:44.763
What happened to it? What did you do?

36:44.840 --> 36:47.286
I don't know. It should have worked.

36:59.720 --> 37:03.247
It's invisible. It's an invisible goldfish.

37:03.440 --> 37:06.523
- Why is it invisible?
- I have no idea.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.291
You can't tell anyone.
You understand that, right?

37:13.360 --> 37:14.964
Not until we figure out how it works.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.129
Okay, Okay.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.011
- Promise?
- Promise.

37:26.440 --> 37:29.603
How are we supposed
to see an invisible goldfish?

37:29.680 --> 37:32.843
Put your finger in. You can feel it.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.604
Ah! It bit me!

37:36.520 --> 37:37.851
Let me see it.

37:55.480 --> 37:58.689
It's my science project,
and it's top secret!

37:59.120 --> 38:00.246
Mmm.

38:02.960 --> 38:06.248
Yeah? Well,
our science fair project is even cooler.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.771
- What is it?
- Double top secret.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.411
Sea-Monkeys?

38:16.160 --> 38:17.721
We got to come up
with something better.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.569
- Bigger.
- I know.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.644
The science fair is in two days.

38:21.720 --> 38:22.881
I know.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.526
- You're the smart one!
- I know.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.366
Hmm.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.607
Okay, okay. Sit still. Shh.

38:43.680 --> 38:47.321
Sparky, no! Shh. No! Shh!

38:48.560 --> 38:52.201
Sorry, boy, but
we can't risk anyone seeing you again.

38:58.760 --> 38:59.761
Shh!

39:16.480 --> 39:19.370
Toshiaki says you
have an invisible fish.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.326
- No, he didn't.
- So, you don't?

39:23.480 --> 39:25.687
I didn't say that. Who said I did?

39:26.040 --> 39:29.965
Toshiaki says it's your
science fair project.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.208
If it was, I couldn't tell you.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.445
So it isn't,

39:36.960 --> 39:38.405
or it is?

39:39.200 --> 39:40.804
No. Yes.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.525
I'm confused.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.524
Do you have an invisible fish?

39:48.320 --> 39:49.401
Okay.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.642
But you have to keep it a secret.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.164
Swish your finger around.
You can feel it.

40:01.960 --> 40:05.487
It's just water. There's nothing there.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.523
No, it's invisible.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.041
Huh?

40:12.800 --> 40:17.010
I don't know what kind
of game you and Victor are playing,

40:17.560 --> 40:20.803
but that trophy will be mine.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.201
Victor.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.404
Something's wrong with my fish!

40:27.480 --> 40:29.562
- What is it?
- It's not there any more.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.530
Maybe it just hopped out.
Did you have the lid on it?

40:33.120 --> 40:35.361
Yes, ever since

40:36.600 --> 40:38.568
I left your house.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.564
I mean, it was there when I went to bed.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.364
I'm thinking maybe they don't last.

40:44.760 --> 40:48.128
They're only there for a little bit
and then they're gone.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.126
No! Sparky!

41:06.200 --> 41:07.361
- Sparky!

41:09.680 --> 41:11.569
Don't worry. I can fix that, too.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.646
Good night, boy.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.086
Mmm.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.609
Are you sure this is going to work?

41:43.360 --> 41:45.931
No. That's why it's called
an "experiment."

41:46.000 --> 41:48.765
We have to collect data.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.569
Do we have to collect it on me?

41:54.240 --> 41:55.401
- Ready?
- No.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.687
Ten, nine, eight...

41:57.760 --> 41:59.000
We could use a test
dummy or something.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.248
...seven, six, five...

42:01.320 --> 42:02.367
Computer simulation.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.841
...four, three, two...

42:04.920 --> 42:07.241
- I have to pee!
- ...one.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.367
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

42:11.720 --> 42:14.371
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

42:14.440 --> 42:16.841
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.924
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Oh!

42:30.800 --> 42:33.121
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ah!

42:33.840 --> 42:35.729
It's working! It's working!

42:56.160 --> 42:58.481
What were you boys doing on the roof?

42:58.760 --> 43:00.000
- Science.
- Science.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.088
As mayor of New Holland,

43:05.920 --> 43:09.049
you have entrusted me with your safety.

43:09.640 --> 43:14.965
So I can't sit idly
while a teacher endangers our children.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.522
The man is a menace!

43:18.480 --> 43:20.528
She's right! He's crazy!

43:20.600 --> 43:23.331
Have you looked through
this science book they're using?

43:23.560 --> 43:27.167
Apparently Pluto isn't good
enough to be a planet any more.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.608
When I was a kid,
Pluto was a great planet.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.682
This guy comes along
and rewrites the rules!

43:31.760 --> 43:34.730
In fairness, he didn't write the textbook.

43:34.840 --> 43:37.889
Mr. Mayor, Edward Frankenstein.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.044
- Your neighbor, of course.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.806
I just would like to say
that our son Victor

43:42.880 --> 43:45.963
is just crazy about the new teacher.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.686
Thinks he's great.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.764
My Cynthia has been asking

43:51.840 --> 43:55.401
all sorts of strange questions
about things I've never even heard of.

43:56.560 --> 43:59.689
Shouldn't we at least give the man
a chance to explain himself?

44:00.560 --> 44:01.527
Yes.

44:01.600 --> 44:05.605
Please come up, Mr. Menace.

44:26.360 --> 44:29.011
Ladies, gentlemen.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.891
I think the confusion here
is that you are all very ignorant.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.244
Is that right word, "ignorant"?

44:37.800 --> 44:41.009
I mean "stupid," "primitive,"
"unenlightened."

44:42.600 --> 44:46.764
You do not understand science,
so you are afraid of it.

44:46.840 --> 44:49.923
Like a dog is afraid
of thunder or balloons.

44:50.040 --> 44:55.285
To you, science is magic and witchcraft
because you have such small minds.

44:58.080 --> 45:00.447
I cannot make your heads bigger,

45:00.520 --> 45:04.684
but your children's heads,
I can take them and crack them open.

45:05.920 --> 45:10.289
This is what I try to do,
to get at their brains!

45:12.880 --> 45:14.006
Oh, my.

45:15.680 --> 45:16.841
Thank you.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.765
Oh, jeez.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.369
Be quick, boy.
They'll be home any minute.

45:27.480 --> 45:30.211
<i>Praise be New Holland</i>

45:31.200 --> 45:34.807
<i>Praise be New Holland</i>

45:35.080 --> 45:39.051
<i>Streets so wide and sidewalk</i>

45:39.960 --> 45:42.531
The sidewalks. Okay.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.760
<i>Praise be New Holland</i>

45:47.840 --> 45:49.080
No! Shh. No!

45:51.560 --> 45:53.164
No, no, no! Shh!

45:54.760 --> 45:56.091
Victor?

46:00.120 --> 46:01.167
Victor?

46:01.240 --> 46:03.925
Hi, Elsa. What are you doing?

46:04.240 --> 46:06.208
Practicing my song for Dutch Day.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.681
It's nice.

46:07.760 --> 46:10.047
- Did you get a new dog?
- No.

46:10.160 --> 46:13.050
- I heard a bark.
- Yeah, that was me.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.170
You are barking?

46:21.200 --> 46:23.601
Hmm. You must really miss Sparky.

46:29.040 --> 46:31.202
Uh, I got to go. Bye.

46:32.680 --> 46:33.727
Bye.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.124
I feel so sad for him, Persephone.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.123
He really misses his dog.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.564
Where's Mr. Rzykruski?

46:53.640 --> 46:56.689
All I know is I'll be teaching the class
for the rest of the semester.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.002
Do you know anything about science?

46:59.320 --> 47:00.731
I know more than you do.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.490
Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.690
Well, sometimes knowing
too much is the problem.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.125
What about the science fair?

47:09.360 --> 47:12.921
Oh, it's still on, but it will be judged
by someone who's not insane!

47:13.000 --> 47:14.001
Me!

47:14.080 --> 47:16.367
Now get cracking,
and may the best person win!

47:20.840 --> 47:23.241
I can't believe they let
the gym teacher be the judge.

47:24.080 --> 47:26.082
She's not even interested in science.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.450
Back home, everyone is scientist.

47:29.640 --> 47:32.928
Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.970
Your country does not
make enough scientist.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.889
Always needs more.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.401
You should be a scientist, Victor.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.170
Nobody likes scientists.

47:42.520 --> 47:46.570
They like what science gives them,
but not the questions, no.

47:46.920 --> 47:49.764
Not the questions that science asks.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.360
Actually, I have a question.

47:55.960 --> 47:58.361
That is why you are a scientist.

47:58.760 --> 48:03.288
I was doing my experiment, my project,
and the first time it worked great,

48:03.640 --> 48:05.244
but the next time it didn't.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.931
I mean, it sort of worked,
but then it didn't.

48:08.080 --> 48:09.491
And I don't know why.

48:09.840 --> 48:13.287
Then maybe you never really
understood it the first time.

48:13.800 --> 48:19.125
People think science is here,
but it is also here.

48:20.320 --> 48:23.130
The first time, did you
love your experiment?

48:23.480 --> 48:24.641
Yes.

48:25.640 --> 48:26.766
Ah.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.404
<i>And the second time?</i>

48:36.640 --> 48:39.211
No. I just wanted it over.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.161
Then you changed the variables.

48:42.680 --> 48:44.523
I was doing it for the wrong reason.

48:44.600 --> 48:47.763
Science is not good or bad, Victor.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.120
But it can be used both ways.

48:51.680 --> 48:55.685
That is why you must always be careful.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.767
I can't believe I broke
my arm for nothing.

49:09.160 --> 49:12.801
None of us are going to win!
E has an invisible fish!

49:13.280 --> 49:16.921
No, he doesn't.
You fell for a parlor trick.

49:18.480 --> 49:21.165
You're saying he faked it?

49:24.840 --> 49:28.049
That fish you showed us, was it real?

49:28.600 --> 49:31.809
It was, and it was dead, too.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.209
You brought an animal
back from the dead?

49:36.840 --> 49:38.410
No, Victor did.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.081
With lightning, and boom, and sss.

49:42.840 --> 49:44.251
Impossible.

49:44.840 --> 49:48.765
I swear! I mean,
he already brought back his dog.

49:50.840 --> 49:52.365
He brought back Sparky?

49:55.960 --> 49:57.121
Mmm.

49:57.640 --> 50:02.362
Victor will win the science fair
unless we can do better.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.161
Bigger.

50:06.040 --> 50:07.769
You say you know Victor's secret?

50:07.840 --> 50:10.081
Now is your chance to prove it.

50:14.960 --> 50:16.291
Now, where's my muffin tin?

50:24.040 --> 50:25.371
Victor.

50:49.960 --> 50:51.610
Sparky?

51:07.480 --> 51:09.482
Sparky! But you're...

51:10.280 --> 51:11.725
Sparky's alive!

51:11.800 --> 51:13.006
Sparky?

51:14.280 --> 51:15.361
Hey, come on!

51:22.080 --> 51:24.162
Mom? Dad? What's going on?

51:24.880 --> 51:27.326
Sparky! No! Sparky!

51:28.960 --> 51:30.246
Sparky. no!

51:30.320 --> 51:31.845
Sparky, come back!

51:31.960 --> 51:33.007
Sparky!

51:33.080 --> 51:34.570
Hey, hey! Just a minute!

51:35.160 --> 51:37.322
No! I have to go find Sparky!

51:37.640 --> 51:39.802
Victor, what have you done?

51:40.640 --> 51:43.405
You said yourself, if you could
bring back Sparky, you would!

51:44.120 --> 51:46.771
Yes, but that was different
because we couldn't!

51:46.840 --> 51:48.922
It's easy to promise the impossible.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.850
What you did was a very serious thing.

51:52.240 --> 51:54.163
Crossing the boundary
between life and death.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.925
Reanimating a corpse!

51:56.000 --> 51:58.810
It's very... Upsetting.

51:59.880 --> 52:01.689
I just wanted my dog back.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.041
Oh, sweetheart.

52:07.200 --> 52:08.964
We'll help you look for Sparky

52:09.040 --> 52:12.567
but when we get back,
I think we need to have a little talk.

52:12.760 --> 52:13.886
Understood?

52:14.840 --> 52:15.887
Yes.

52:16.360 --> 52:18.727
Now, let's go find your dog.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.167
Sparky!

52:48.240 --> 52:49.765
Sparky, are you in there?

52:55.040 --> 52:57.611
Mom, Dad! I'm going
to check the school and the park.

52:57.720 --> 53:00.007
You guys do the town square, okay?

53:00.080 --> 53:01.320
Got it.

53:01.840 --> 53:03.001
Sparky!

53:03.080 --> 53:04.081
Sparky!

53:41.840 --> 53:42.921
Cool.

53:46.240 --> 53:48.004
Interesting.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.927
It has something
to do with the lightning.

53:51.040 --> 53:53.122
I don't really understand it.

53:54.160 --> 53:57.164
Oh, but I do!

54:05.480 --> 54:10.486
Tonight, we shall bring the dead to life!

54:17.040 --> 54:19.168
Sparky! Where are you?

54:20.680 --> 54:22.045
Sparky!

55:25.280 --> 55:27.567
Sparky! Sparky!

55:33.000 --> 55:35.446
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

55:36.440 --> 55:39.171
<i>And now it's my pleasure</i>

55:39.240 --> 55:42.528
<i>to introduce this year's Little Dutch Girl,</i>

55:42.920 --> 55:46.288
<i>my niece, Elsa Van Helsing.</i>

55:55.120 --> 55:56.770
I don't think this is safe.

55:57.600 --> 56:00.365
Nonsense! We have
the fire chief over here.

56:03.200 --> 56:06.807
You know, a lot of girls
would kill to be in your place.

56:07.960 --> 56:09.450
I'd welcome death.

56:13.120 --> 56:16.841
<i>Praise be New Holland</i>

56:17.200 --> 56:20.966
<i>Streets so wide and sidewalks clean</i>

56:21.040 --> 56:24.965
<i>Modest homes at modest prices</i>

56:25.240 --> 56:28.642
<i>Everyone's hope and dream</i>

56:47.920 --> 56:49.490
I'm going to win.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.809
No, I shall win the science fair.

56:53.440 --> 56:54.521
Hmm.

56:55.120 --> 56:58.602
<i>In our houses tight and safe</i>

56:58.680 --> 57:02.366
<i>We have nothing to fear</i>

57:09.840 --> 57:10.966
Ah.

57:11.080 --> 57:13.481
The tomb of Colossus.

57:13.920 --> 57:16.366
Soon you shall be awakened

57:16.600 --> 57:20.207
and we shall be reunited once again!

57:32.400 --> 57:34.209
Ah, Shelley.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.322
<i>Praise be New Holland</i>

59:38.400 --> 59:43.770
<i>May your windmills spin forevermore</i>

59:45.120 --> 59:46.804
Isn't she adorable?

59:46.880 --> 59:48.689
Mm.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.481
Mr. Whiskers?

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.410
Mr. Whiskers?

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.961
Hello!

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.921
Is someone there?

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.164
Rise, Colossus.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.160
Rise from your tomb!

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.007
Huh!

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.201
Shelley?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.521
Shelley?

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.246
Sparky!

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.080
Sparky!

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.081
Sparky?

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.601
Sparky?

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.086
Sparky!

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.165
Sparky, it's okay, boy. It's just me.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.205
I thought that you were gone.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.530
I never want to lose you.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.486
Promise you'll never go
running off, okay?

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.086
Come on, boy.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.165
Was someone else here?

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.447
- Victor! I need your help.
- Did you see those things?

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.045
- They were like...
- Sea-Monkeys!

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.804
You know how on
the package, they're like,

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.121
in a happy kingdom
and everyone's smiling?

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.646
- Yeah?
- They're not like that at all.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.690
- Victor! I need your help.
- I asked him first!

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.807
My problem bigger!

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.888
Yeah, he's right.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.845
Okay, let's go!

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.122
<i>And now for our next act,</i>

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.449
<i>we have something really big.</i>

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.122
No! Get away!

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.002
Oh, oh!

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.450
This way! In here!

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.649
Go, Colossus.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.042
Kill! Kill!

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.926
Kill!

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.171
Colossus?

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.290
Mm! Mm-mm!

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.290
Get away from me!

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.890
Get away from me!

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.645
Your Sea-Monkeys.
Are they freshwater or saltwater?

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.051
Freshwater.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:39.442
Freshwater animals can't tolerate salt.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:49.930
Hey! Over here!

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.847
Cool.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.801
Help!

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.121
Get back!

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.445
Stay away from us!

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.400
Sparky!

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.847
No, no, no, no!

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.522
Whoa, stop!
You put me down! I gave you life!

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.446
Victor! Victor, I need help. Please!

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.681
Shelley?

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.450
Persephone!

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.242
Persephone, are you okay?

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.286
- Here, Mr. Whiskers.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.489
Here, kitty, kitty, Mr. Whiskers.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.724
- No!

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.486
Persephone!

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.765
Bring her back!

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.123
Mr. Whiskers.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.804
I'm coming, Elsa!

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.891
What happened?

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.811
Sparky! There you are.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.241
Are you all right?

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.486
What you got there, boy?

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.881
Let me through!

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.887
I knew it. It's the boy's dead dog!

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.731
That's Elsa's wig.
Where's my niece?

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.208
He's killed the little girl!

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.367
After him! Kill the monster!

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.961
Help!

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.681
Help!

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.085
Stay away from us!

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.046
Get him!

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.685
Where's my niece?

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.244
Look out! It's on fire!

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.685
There's Elsa!

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.561
Help!

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.321
Ow!

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.366
Elsa!

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.445
Sparky!

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.287
Victor!

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.807
- Help!
- Hang on! Don't let go!

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.291
I can't reach!

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.241
Hang on!

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.044
I can't hold on much longer.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.081
Sparky!

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.846
Victor!

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.524
Stay back. It's too dangerous.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.761
That's my son in there!

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.204
Oh! Oh!

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.491
Victor!

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.921
- Victor!
- Honey, are you all right?

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.606
Sparky!

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:37.700
No!

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.366
Victor,

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.568
is there anything we can do for you?

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.967
You said that I need to let him go.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:26.521
Sometimes adults don't know
what they're talking about.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.651
Start your engines!

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.443
Give it more juice!

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.284
Turn off your engines!

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.808
It's okay, boy.
You don't have to come back.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.929
You'll always be in my heart.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.645
- Sparky!

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.083
<i>Love</i>

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.281

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.566
