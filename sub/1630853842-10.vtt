WEBVTT

00:29.487 --> 00:30.989
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.449
You just killed that man.

00:33.491 --> 00:37.579
I just saved your life, again.
And I'm trying to save yours.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.080
From whom?

00:39.664 --> 00:40.790
From Morpheus.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.335
Who's Morpheus?

00:45.253 --> 00:47.630
Uh, Jeddy, can you give us a minute?

01:05.023 --> 01:06.900
You're one of the missing Nightmares.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.528
And you are the vortex.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.326
If you know that,
then you know Morpheus is watching me.

01:16.951 --> 01:20.330
You think he's watching you
so he can protect you?

01:21.247 --> 01:24.375
He's watching you
because the minute you fall asleep

01:24.459 --> 01:27.837
and start bringing the walls down
between people's dreams,

01:29.172 --> 01:30.924
he's gonna kill you.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.011
But if someone protected you,
kept him from killing you,

01:36.679 --> 01:39.599
well, then you'd become
the center of the Dreaming.

01:40.725 --> 01:44.771
He'd be powerless and I would be free.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.241
Ah. Good Doctor.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.619
Fifteen minutes till
our guest speaker's keynote address.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.581
Uh, how did it go with Philip Sitz?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.500
It went well.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.419
You were missed.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.006
-Did you find the boy?
-I did.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.675
We talked.

02:14.175 --> 02:17.137
He saw some grown-up things downstairs
that he didn't understand,

02:17.220 --> 02:18.429
but I explained it to him.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.807
He won't be a problem?

02:20.890 --> 02:22.267
Nothing I can't handle.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.728
I'll see you downstairs.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.448
So, I'm gonna go downstairs for an hour.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.452
Will you wait for me?

02:43.580 --> 02:47.667
No. I'm taking Jed. We're going home.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.003
Okay.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.214
Yeah, you can go if you want,

02:53.715 --> 02:56.926
but obviously it's not safe for you
to be wandering around the hotel.

02:57.510 --> 03:01.097
And if you leave the hotel,
Dream's Raven will find you.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.393
I'll tell you what.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.146
This is your room.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.274
You can have both keys.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.319
I'll come back in an hour.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.155
I'll knock.
If you want, you can let me in.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.866
But if not, I'll go away.

03:20.950 --> 03:24.412
Lock the door when I leave,
because you never know.

03:31.878 --> 03:36.424
Our guest of honor's presence
here tonight is proof,

03:37.508 --> 03:38.718
at least to me,

03:39.510 --> 03:42.889
that dreams do come true.

03:42.972 --> 03:46.351
He is a legend in his own lifetime,

03:47.101 --> 03:48.770
an inspiration to us all,

03:49.938 --> 03:54.192
one of the first and one of the best.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.863
Gentlemen. Ladies.

03:59.697 --> 04:00.823
The Corinthian.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.134
I don't usually speak in public,

04:21.302 --> 04:24.555
but the opportunity
to talk to so many people

04:25.056 --> 04:28.768
who share the same passion,
the same dream,

04:29.769 --> 04:31.980
well, it was just too good to pass up.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.692
Because you are special people.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.570
Very special people.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.949
We are the American dreamers

04:43.700 --> 04:47.161
driving down the holy road
of true knowledge

04:47.912 --> 04:51.624
that's paved with blood and gold.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.545
And across the length
and breadth of this fair country,

04:56.713 --> 04:58.756
we are killing people.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.885
We don't do it to make a living,

05:03.928 --> 05:05.847
we don't do it for revenge.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.976
We do not murder for profit.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.772
We kill to kill.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.985
We are entrepreneurs
in an expanding field.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.949
But no one sees us
except for one weekend a year.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.119
Well, I see you.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.622
I see you for who you truly are.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.375
And I want you to see it, too.

05:36.085 --> 05:39.964
So just do me a favor.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.759
Close your eyes.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.349
And see yourselves as I do.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.312
We are gladiators.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.106
Conquerors.

05:57.648 --> 06:00.485
-We are explorers…

06:00.568 --> 06:04.322
-…truth seekers.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.407
We are swashbucklers.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.868
We are hunters.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.080
Soldiers of fortune.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.463
And kings of the night.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.969
Jeddy, we have to go.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.475
You disappoint me, Corinthian.

06:35.853 --> 06:42.151
You and these humans
you've inspired and created…

06:43.694 --> 06:44.779
disappoint me.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.491
I've done my best to be what you made me.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.286
No, you've done your worst,

06:52.370 --> 06:55.373
which was in so many ways
what I had hoped.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.875
You were my masterpiece.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.380
A dark mirror made to reflect
everything humanity will not confront.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.133
That's what I am.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.010
That's what I've done.

07:08.094 --> 07:12.515
No. Look at you,
walking this Earth for over a century

07:12.598 --> 07:16.310
infecting others with your joy of death,
but what have you given them?

07:16.978 --> 07:19.564
What have you wrought? Nothing.

07:21.357 --> 07:25.319
Just something else
for people to be afraid of. That is all.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.448
So what now?

07:29.365 --> 07:31.492
You send me back into their dreams?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.622
'Cause I won't go willingly.

07:38.207 --> 07:42.378
And knife against a dream?

07:43.754 --> 07:45.882
You don't think dreams can die?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.092
-Let's find out.
-Enough.

08:03.983 --> 08:04.901
How?

08:06.277 --> 08:08.571
I've got
Rose Walker getting stronger

08:08.654 --> 08:10.698
every second while you get weaker

08:14.702 --> 08:17.371
She's taking your place
at the center of the Dreaming.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.797
She's bringing the walls down
between the sleepers' minds

08:27.965 --> 08:31.302
and now they're all dreaming
the same dream.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.970
A dream that I inspired.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.264
-No.
-It's already happening.

08:35.348 --> 08:39.393
There's nothing you can do.
She's asleep and dreaming.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.771
Then she's not beyond my reach.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.023
Oh, I think she is.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.152
Now that she knows
you're planning to kill her.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.116
Jed, run!

08:55.493 --> 08:57.411
You need to wake up.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.372
Don't listen to him, Rosebud.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.583
You're the one with power now,
not him. This is your dream.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.169
It's his dream, for your world.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.506
Then let's make it yours.
Whatever you want, Rose. A blank canvas.

09:10.883 --> 09:11.926
Where's Jed?

09:12.009 --> 09:13.052
Jed's fine.

09:13.135 --> 09:16.389
He's upstairs, asleep.
He's right next to you.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.434
This dream is yours now.
The Dreaming is yours now.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.396
The Dreaming is yours.
Is that what he told you?

09:23.479 --> 09:25.189
He told me you were gonna kill me.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.357
Did he tell you why?

09:26.440 --> 09:29.151
When a vortex brings down
the walls between dreams,

09:29.235 --> 09:31.195
she creates a single volatile dream

09:31.279 --> 09:34.115
that will collapse in upon itself,
and take the waking world with it.

09:34.198 --> 09:37.451
Your world.
Everything and everyone will die.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.204
-Don't believe him, Rosie.
-It's happened before.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.916
I failed in my duty,
an entire universe was lost.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.127
He can't kill you
if you kill him first.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.461
Killing me may save your life,

09:47.545 --> 09:49.380
but it won't save the lives
of those you love.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.592
-I'm trying to keep you alive here.
-I'm trying to keep your world alive.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.885
-You have to choose one of us, Rose.
-Enough!

09:59.098 --> 10:03.811
If I'm as powerful as you say I am,
then I will find my own way.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.647
In the meantime, the walls go back up.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.029
Because I'm not dreaming anymore.

10:14.530 --> 10:17.992
Thanks to you two, I'm wide awake.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.463
If you think I'm going
back to the Dreaming with you--

10:30.546 --> 10:31.964
You're not going back.

10:33.841 --> 10:37.553
I brought you into this world
to serve humanity. Not to feed upon it.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.598
Do you know why I do it?

10:42.558 --> 10:46.395
So I can taste what it's like to be human.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.025
And you don't care about humanity.

10:51.859 --> 10:56.322
You only care about yourself
and your realm and your rules.

10:56.405 --> 11:00.743
I contain the entire
collective unconscious.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.788
Without my rules, it would consume me.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.625
Humanity would be consumed.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.086
Or you might actually feel something.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.215
I am not the problem, Dream.

11:16.050 --> 11:16.967
You're right.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.012
This was my fault. Not yours.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.849
I had so much hope for you.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.894
But I created you poorly then.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.942
So I must uncreate you now.

11:41.325 --> 11:45.871
I am only sorry I won't be here
to see Rose Walker do the same to you.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.687
Next time I make you,
you will not be so flawed

12:09.770 --> 12:12.440
and petty, little Dream.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.569
And you…

12:18.738 --> 12:21.490
who call yourselves "collectors,"

12:22.658 --> 12:26.996
until now, you have sustained fantasies

12:27.079 --> 12:30.040
in which you are the victims,

12:30.624 --> 12:35.880
comforting daydreams
in which you are always right.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.425
But no more.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.511
The dream is over.

12:43.888 --> 12:50.561
I have taken it away.
For this is my judgment upon you,

12:52.396 --> 12:54.190
that you shall know

12:55.399 --> 12:57.443
from this moment on

12:58.986 --> 13:02.698
exactly how craven and selfish

13:03.616 --> 13:05.743
and monstrous you are.

13:07.036 --> 13:12.249
That you shall feel the pain
of those you have slaughtered.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.084
Hello, 9-1-1?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.798
I'm calling to confess to a crime.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.384
And the grief of those
that mourn them still,

13:23.093 --> 13:29.934
and you shall carry
that pain and grief and guilt

13:30.768 --> 13:33.521
with you until the end of time.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.078
You want me to follow her?

13:49.161 --> 13:52.665
No. When she is awake,
she is not a threat.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.167
Tonight when she sleeps, I will find her.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.712
And we will end this.

14:04.718 --> 14:05.970
Can I ask a question?

14:07.263 --> 14:10.182
Is Mom still sick, or…

14:11.851 --> 14:13.519
I'm sorry, Jeddy.

14:14.728 --> 14:15.604
She…

14:17.106 --> 14:19.108
She passed away a few months ago.

14:23.654 --> 14:28.158
You have to know though,
she never stopped trying to get you back.

14:30.119 --> 14:33.873
Dad just didn't wanna let you go.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.712
So, it's just you and me now?

14:41.964 --> 14:44.842
No. No, actually.

14:44.925 --> 14:49.263
We have a great-grandmother
who can't wait to meet you.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.850
And my best friend Lyta,
who lives upstairs.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.685
-She's calling you.

14:56.186 --> 14:59.023
Hey! Guess who's in the car with me?

14:59.106 --> 15:02.192
I don't want you to panic.
I'm at the hospital.

15:02.776 --> 15:03.611
What?

15:03.694 --> 15:05.988
The baby's coming. I'm in labor.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.239
Oh, my God!

15:07.323 --> 15:08.490
Is that Rose?

15:08.574 --> 15:11.368
And Barbie and Ken and Hal are here.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.287
We're taking good care of her, Rose.

15:13.370 --> 15:17.458
-Chantal and Zelda are on the way.
-So are we, I promise.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.752
Don't rush. Drive safely.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.129
See you soon.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.844
How is she? Is she okay?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.138
I am sure she's fine,
but we are not family

15:31.221 --> 15:32.765
so they're not telling us anything.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.352
So, did you know she was pregnant?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.354
Of course she knew.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.315
You did know, didn't you?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.401
Everyone, this is Jed.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.403
-Jed! Hi.
-Hey, Jed!

15:47.363 --> 15:48.906
Is that a real spider?

15:48.989 --> 15:50.074
It used to be.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.243
We have a vast collection
of arachnid taxidermy.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.536
If you'd like to see?

15:54.620 --> 15:55.913
Hey, Rose.

15:56.538 --> 16:00.167
Uh, so she's still only three centimeters.
The doctor's with her now.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.086
Oh, that, um, nurse told you that?

16:02.169 --> 16:03.879
Yeah. Yeah. She's really nice.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.465
Yeah, she looks really nice.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.759
Uh, where's Gilbert?

16:09.343 --> 16:14.056
He left a note saying he had to go home.
I thought he was with you guys.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.015
Uh, no.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.977
Well, is there anyone
we should call? Lyta's family?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.396
Or the baby's daddy, whoever it is.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.481
You don't have to tell us.
Who is he?

16:23.273 --> 16:26.610
It's too late to call anyone right now.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.736
Although…

16:28.320 --> 16:29.196
Unity?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.532
Good morning, darling.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.409
I woke you up. I'm sorry.

16:33.492 --> 16:38.998
Oh, Rose, the one thing I do not
need more of in my life is sleep.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.582
Did you find Jed?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.876
I did. He's safe.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.296
But may I ask a favor?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.757
Of course, darling. Anything!

16:49.967 --> 16:56.348
If something were to
happen to me, hypothetically…

16:56.432 --> 16:58.559
Nothing's going to happen to you.

16:58.642 --> 16:59.685
If something did…

16:59.768 --> 17:02.187
If I went to sleep tonight
and didn't wake up,

17:02.771 --> 17:06.066
would Jed be able to come live with you?

17:07.818 --> 17:11.530
I was going to suggest that you
and Jed both come and live with me.

17:12.114 --> 17:12.990
You were?

17:13.073 --> 17:14.533
Oh, Rose.

17:14.616 --> 17:18.412
I often wonder what my life would have
been like had I not slept through it.

17:19.413 --> 17:23.375
Would I have had a family,
and what must that be like?

17:24.877 --> 17:29.089
Once you and Jed get here,
I won't have to wonder anymore.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.635
You really are amazing. Do you know that?

17:33.719 --> 17:35.929
It runs in the family.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.476
Get some sleep.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.646
I'm sorry I woke you. Sweet dreams.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.065
Goodbye, love.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.781
You okay?

17:54.990 --> 18:00.245
Zelda has a reassuring moral homily
concerning God and difficult times,

18:00.329 --> 18:03.207
and a variable number
of footprints in the sand.

18:03.916 --> 18:08.087
She told it to me once
and it cheered me up remarkably.

18:08.796 --> 18:09.797
Shall I ask if--

18:09.880 --> 18:12.257
Excuse me. Are you Rose?

18:13.759 --> 18:16.637
I'm sorry to put this on you right now.

18:17.137 --> 18:17.971
Don't be.

18:18.931 --> 18:25.270
I'm just afraid that tonight,
when I fall asleep…

18:27.481 --> 18:29.316
Dream's gonna kill me.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.526
He's not.

18:30.609 --> 18:35.197
He said if he doesn't kill me
that the whole world will die.

18:36.949 --> 18:37.991
Everyone.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.576
Listen to me.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.329
If this is true,

18:43.080 --> 18:45.290
if you have the power
to destroy the world,

18:45.874 --> 18:48.502
then you have the power to destroy him.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.754
I don't want to destroy him.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.506
I don't want any of this.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.384
I'm afraid to fall asleep.
I'm afraid to wake up.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.677
He should be afraid.

18:57.636 --> 19:02.349
When you go to sleep tonight,
you have to find him and end this.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.476
It's up to you, Rose.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.481
You're in charge now. You're the vortex.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.658
There is a vortex,

19:20.534 --> 19:22.035
a true annulet,

19:23.078 --> 19:24.705
a mortal with a dreaming ability

19:24.788 --> 19:28.083
so powerful she can travel
through the dreams of others.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.918
Be careful not to lose yourself in them.

19:30.002 --> 19:30.961
Find your own path.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.131
You think he's watching you
so he can protect you?

19:34.214 --> 19:37.467
The minute you fall asleep
and start bringing the walls down

19:37.551 --> 19:38.760
between people's dreams…

19:38.844 --> 19:41.096
You have the power to destroy him.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.306
He's gonna kill you.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.016
-You're the vortex.
-Rose!

20:25.641 --> 20:27.476
And this is the story he told.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.770
It was a dark and stormy night.

20:29.853 --> 20:33.523
And the skipper said to the mate,
"Mate, tell me a story."

20:33.607 --> 20:35.108
And this is the story he told.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.527
It was a dark and stormy night.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.948
And the skipper said to the mate,
"Mate, tell me a story."

20:41.031 --> 20:43.909
And this is the story he told.
It was a dark and stormy night.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.327
And the skipper said to the mate,

20:45.410 --> 20:46.787
-"Mate, tell me a story."
-Chantal?

20:46.870 --> 20:49.122
-And this is the story he told.
-It's me. Rose.

20:49.206 --> 20:52.751
It was a dark and stormy night.
And the skipper said to the mate,

20:52.834 --> 20:54.836
-"Mate, tell me a story."
-Here, let me.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.380
And this is the story he told.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.591
It was a dark and stormy night.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.843
And the skipper said to the mate,

21:01.927 --> 21:05.264
"Mate, tell me a story."
And this is the story he told.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.684
-It was a da--
-In September of the year 1811,

21:08.767 --> 21:12.688
a post chaise drew up
before the door of Aswarby Hall

21:12.771 --> 21:14.564
in the heart of Lincolnshire.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.402
The little boy, who jumped out
as soon as it had stopped,

21:18.485 --> 21:19.611
looked around him.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.908
Caution, Princess Barbara,
I scent strangeness in the air.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.411
What manner of they, Martin Tenbones?

21:27.494 --> 21:31.290
The Cuckoo? The Hieromancer?
Colonel Knowledge?

21:31.373 --> 21:32.749
None of those.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.794
Something is happening, my princess. Look.

21:38.922 --> 21:39.798
Ken?

21:41.967 --> 21:44.094
What are you doing at
the Place of Lost Carnadine?

21:44.177 --> 21:45.345
Oh, shit.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.016
Oh, my God.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.602
Come, Martin Tenbones. We must away.

21:54.730 --> 21:55.856
What are you all doing here?

21:56.732 --> 22:00.902
Babe. Th-This is not what it looks like.
Uh, I mean…

22:06.533 --> 22:07.993
-Oh, dear.

22:09.870 --> 22:10.996
Oh, my God.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.173
What's happening?

22:23.342 --> 22:26.178
It's me. I'm sorry. But it's just a dream.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.638
You just have to wake up. Right now.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.599
-Rose!
-Rose, please!

22:31.892 --> 22:33.226
Rose!

22:34.353 --> 22:37.147
Rose, why are you doing this?

22:37.230 --> 22:39.066
I can't stop it. You have to wake up.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.942
Please, I'm begging you.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.486
It was a dark and stormy night…

22:42.569 --> 22:44.529
A post chaise…

22:44.613 --> 22:46.656
"Tell me a story."

22:47.240 --> 22:48.200
Zelda!

22:51.370 --> 22:52.662
Rose!

22:53.246 --> 22:54.873
-Hal!
-I found you!

22:55.957 --> 22:57.584
-Hal, hold on.
-Don't let go!

22:59.002 --> 23:00.337
Hal!

23:01.546 --> 23:03.173
Rose, I'll save you!

23:04.049 --> 23:05.717
No, Jed, stay back.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.719
-I'll save you!
-No!

23:07.803 --> 23:11.515
-Rose! Rose!
-Jed!

23:11.598 --> 23:13.100
-Rose!
-Jed!

23:14.184 --> 23:15.018
Jed!

23:17.354 --> 23:18.563
Jed!

23:20.273 --> 23:22.526
You've caused a great deal of damage.

23:22.609 --> 23:25.529
Nothing that I cannot repair,
at least at this stage.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.823
What happened to Jed? To my friends?

23:27.906 --> 23:30.909
They're asleep in their bed,
but they're not safe. No one is.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.995
Not until the vortex is dead.

23:57.894 --> 23:58.937
May I help you?

23:59.855 --> 24:02.941
Oh, yes, please. I-I'm looking for a book.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.987
We have every book ever written,
as well as those yet unwritten.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.865
I'm looking for the story of my life,

24:11.283 --> 24:12.993
had things turned out differently.

24:14.077 --> 24:17.414
I have detailed accounts
of sleepers' dreams.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.083
No. No, thank you. I've had
more than my fair share of dreams.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.213
I want to read about my unlived life.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.551
I'm not entirely sure
we have those volumes.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.430
If you have every book ever written,

24:33.513 --> 24:38.310
and every book that ever will be written,
it must be around here somewhere.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.146
Oh, there I am.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.817
You're Unity Kincaid?

24:48.361 --> 24:50.822
Rose Walker is your great-granddaughter?

24:50.906 --> 24:51.740
Yes.

24:54.075 --> 24:55.577
How do you know Rose?

25:03.752 --> 25:06.087
Death is not always such a bad thing.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.673
You could stay here if you like.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.967
My raven was once a mortal.

25:12.552 --> 25:15.222
Wait! Sir!

25:16.681 --> 25:19.142
Gilbert? What are you doing here?

25:20.185 --> 25:21.394
This is Fiddler's Green.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.065
You? You're a Dream?

25:25.148 --> 25:26.066
I am.

25:26.942 --> 25:31.363
I, I left my post here
to experience life as a human being.

25:31.446 --> 25:36.076
A life which I humbly offer
in exchange for yours.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.579
I'm afraid that's not possible.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.706
For the Dreaming
and the waking world to live,

25:41.790 --> 25:43.041
the vortex must die.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.544
Then what's the point of a vortex?

25:46.753 --> 25:48.338
Why do we even exist?

25:48.421 --> 25:49.548
Honestly…

25:50.257 --> 25:52.050
I have a theory.

25:52.592 --> 25:56.638
When a human is at
the center of the Dreaming,

25:56.721 --> 26:01.560
is it not to remind us
that we exist because humans dream,

26:01.643 --> 26:03.395
not the other way around?

26:04.020 --> 26:09.359
The miracle of humanity itself
should always be more vivid to us

26:09.442 --> 26:11.945
than any marvels of power.

26:14.155 --> 26:18.285
I cannot find it in my heart
to punish you for leaving Fiddler's Green.

26:19.452 --> 26:22.247
But it is time you took up
your appointed position once more.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.999
It would be my honor, sir.

26:24.082 --> 26:27.252
It was never my intention
to abandon my role.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.714
What was your role? Who were you?

26:30.797 --> 26:34.968
Oh, my dear, Fiddler's Green
is not a "who," it is a where.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.763
I was not a person. I was a place.

26:39.472 --> 26:43.435
And, after your death,

26:44.269 --> 26:48.064
if you stay in the Dreaming, visit me.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.359
Walk in my meadows and my green glades.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.737
Rest beneath my trees.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.950
Farewell, Rose Walker.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.953
It was a privilege being human with you.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.277
I do not wish to take your life.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.365
But we all have responsibilities
and this is one of mine.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.001
I am sorry.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.795
Just do it.

27:51.878 --> 27:54.631
Whatever it takes
to save my brother and my friends.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.717
I'm ready.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.650
My lord, stop.

28:15.568 --> 28:16.403
Unity?

28:16.986 --> 28:18.655
This is Unity Kincaid.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.407
I am Rose's great-grandmother.

28:21.324 --> 28:25.412
And according to this book,
I was meant to be the vortex of this age.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.790
But because you were imprisoned
and locked out of the Dreaming,

28:28.873 --> 28:30.875
that fate was handed down
to my descendants.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.252
I don't understand.

28:32.335 --> 28:34.254
You're not very bright, are you?

28:35.213 --> 28:36.256
Come here, Rose.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.468
I want you to reach down inside yourself

28:40.552 --> 28:43.179
and give me whatever it is
that makes you the vortex.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.598
But h-how?

28:46.182 --> 28:47.726
You're dreaming, darling.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.353
Anything is possible.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.123
This?

29:12.375 --> 29:14.085
Oh, thank you, Rose, love.

29:19.090 --> 29:23.887
I'm the vortex now, Dream King,
as I should have been long ago.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.556
So, leave my great-granddaughter alone.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.324
Unity?

29:45.742 --> 29:46.743
What happened?

29:47.744 --> 29:51.581
You died. So that Rose might live.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.504
I'm so sorry.

29:57.587 --> 30:00.173
No, don't be. I'm not.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.468
I was meant to have died
a long time ago, Rose.

30:04.719 --> 30:06.137
But if I had,

30:07.931 --> 30:10.225
I would never have met my golden-eyed man

30:11.017 --> 30:13.937
and we would never have
had our beautiful baby girl,

30:14.020 --> 30:16.064
and you would not have been born.

30:16.147 --> 30:19.818
Wait, the father of your child
had golden eyes?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.320
I've never seen anything like them.

30:25.698 --> 30:26.741
I have.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.662
Goodbye, Rose, darling.

30:32.247 --> 30:36.417
Mr. Holdaway will see to it
that you and Jed have everything you need.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.594
You and your brother
are children of the Endless.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.391
You have suffered enough.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.977
You may leave this place.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.937
Goodbye, Rose.

31:20.295 --> 31:23.590
He's really strong.
He won't let go of my finger.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.217
He's perfect.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.053
We're gonna do this together, right?

31:29.929 --> 31:33.182
We already are. Right, little man?

31:33.266 --> 31:36.811
I'm your Auntie Rose.
And this is your cousin, Jed.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.021
Hello, little baby.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.064
Have you decided on a name?

31:41.065 --> 31:43.484
I thought about
naming him after Hector, but…

31:44.986 --> 31:46.529
there is only one Hector for me.

31:48.698 --> 31:51.826
And this baby deserves his own name.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.705
You ever notice how people
only ever use your name

31:55.788 --> 31:56.915
when you're in trouble?

31:57.957 --> 31:59.125
Rose?

31:59.709 --> 32:01.210
That's true, actually.

32:01.794 --> 32:06.090
See? So, as long as you don't have a name,
you can't get in any trouble.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.436
My turn.

32:18.519 --> 32:20.271
Prepare yourself. He's pretty cute.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.148
Oh, we are ready.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.150
It's one at a time.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.361
Wha… Oh, come on. Babe!

32:27.028 --> 32:28.821
Baby, it was just a dream.

32:32.992 --> 32:34.118
How are they doing?

32:34.202 --> 32:35.036
Great.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.539
The hospital's releasing them tonight
and then we'll fly home tomorrow.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.749
Oh, so soon?

32:39.832 --> 32:41.125
To New Brunswick.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.294
How far is that from New York?

32:43.378 --> 32:46.756
Mm, less than an hour. Why?

32:46.839 --> 32:49.884
I don't know, I had this dream last night

32:49.968 --> 32:53.805
and now I'm thinking,
what if I sell the house and move back?

32:56.432 --> 32:57.684
We'll buy the house.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.459
Desire.

33:24.585 --> 33:27.547
I stand in my gallery
and I hold your sigil.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.382
Talk to me.

33:30.049 --> 33:33.261
Why, sweet Dream. This is a surprise.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.221
-Almost an event, I might say.
-Good.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.222
I'm coming through.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.099
You are?

33:39.350 --> 33:40.476
But of course.

33:40.977 --> 33:44.063
You know you're always
welcome in my chambers.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.904
Lovely to see you.

33:53.740 --> 33:57.410
Can I get you anything you desire?

33:58.161 --> 34:00.997
I desire nothing from you,
save some answers.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.041
Ooh, is this a test?

34:03.541 --> 34:06.961
Unity Kincaid should've
been the vortex of this era.

34:08.254 --> 34:11.299
But someone took advantage
of my imprisonment

34:11.382 --> 34:14.135
and fathered a child with her,

34:14.218 --> 34:17.055
knowing full well
that it would become the vortex,

34:17.138 --> 34:18.806
and I would be forced to kill it.

34:19.515 --> 34:21.934
Was I really that obvious?

34:22.518 --> 34:23.352
No.

34:24.812 --> 34:27.398
You covered your tracks remarkably well.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.276
Well, that's high praise coming from you.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.403
What did you truly intend?

34:33.071 --> 34:34.739
That I should spill family blood?

34:35.740 --> 34:37.450
With all that would entail?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.496
This time it almost worked.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.666
My sibling.

34:47.668 --> 34:52.006
We of the Endless are the servants
of the living, not their masters.

34:53.424 --> 34:59.931
We exist only because they know
deep in their hearts that we exist.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.226
We do not manipulate them.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.562
If anything, they manipulate us.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.816
And you and Despair,

35:10.358 --> 35:13.778
and even poor Delirium
would do well to remember that.

35:15.530 --> 35:19.742
Mess with me or mine again
and I shall forget you are family.

35:21.244 --> 35:24.539
Do you believe yourself
strong enough to stand against me?

35:25.665 --> 35:26.749
Against Death?

35:27.917 --> 35:29.127
Against Destiny?

35:33.131 --> 35:34.048
No.

35:35.716 --> 35:39.846
Remember that next time you're
inspired to interfere in my affairs.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.681
Oh, poor Dream.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.392
I really got under your skin
this time, didn't I?

35:46.352 --> 35:50.356
Next time, I'll draw blood.

36:11.919 --> 36:12.879
My lord.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.257
Sorry to disturb you
when you're working, but…

36:16.340 --> 36:17.341
Is something wrong?

36:18.050 --> 36:21.721
No, it's something lovely, actually.

36:22.638 --> 36:27.310
A new book appeared in the library
this morning written by Rose Walker.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.061
And how is it?

36:29.896 --> 36:33.941
You may take issue with the depiction
of the king in the story, but…

36:34.734 --> 36:35.693
I loved it.

36:35.776 --> 36:38.988
She is a daughter of the Endless
with quite a story to tell.

36:40.072 --> 36:42.283
-Rosie, send it.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.368
It's really good.

36:44.952 --> 36:47.455
Come eat. Dinner's here. Let's go.

37:00.134 --> 37:04.805
Are you making new Nightmares
to replace Gault and the Corinthian?

37:04.889 --> 37:08.351
The world does not need
a new Corinthian quite yet.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.229
In fact…

37:13.564 --> 37:16.943
will you keep this somewhere safe for me?

37:18.110 --> 37:20.571
I am finishing a Dream.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.573
I'll leave you to it, then.

37:25.993 --> 37:26.994
Lucienne.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.290
Do you not wish to say hello?

37:44.387 --> 37:46.639
You look gorgeous, Gault.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.060
Thank you, Lucienne.

37:55.439 --> 37:59.819
May I ask what made you
change your mind about me, sir?

38:00.611 --> 38:03.656
I had no right returning here
after over a century

38:03.739 --> 38:05.866
expecting everything
to be just as I left it.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.910
Lucienne tried to tell me that.

38:08.995 --> 38:09.912
So did you.

38:11.038 --> 38:12.665
But now I'm listening.

38:12.748 --> 38:15.584
Or trying to.

38:19.797 --> 38:20.840
New Dreams.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.302
New Nightmares.

38:26.887 --> 38:27.847
A new age.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.311
Thank you, sir.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.665
I might be here awhile.

38:56.334 --> 39:02.423
Would you mind
taking care of things while I work?

39:04.300 --> 39:06.344
With pleasure, sir.

39:44.423 --> 39:45.466
Your Majesty.

39:50.888 --> 39:54.266
Shall I ring for your attendants
to help you dress?

39:55.893 --> 39:59.230
There are several demon battles
scheduled for your entertainment.

39:59.772 --> 40:02.233
I can think of nothing I'd enjoy less.

40:02.733 --> 40:06.070
In which case
Lord Azazel would like a word.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.073
Except that.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.742
Then I will
be brief, Your Majesty.

40:14.453 --> 40:19.458
Azazel, how like you
to arrive without an invitation.

40:19.542 --> 40:23.712
I come at the bidding of
the assembled Lords of Hell.

40:24.296 --> 40:27.925
You've stopped fighting each other
long enough to assemble?

40:28.008 --> 40:34.306
We have, against your enemy,
our enemy, Dream of the Endless.

40:34.390 --> 40:39.228
The armies of Hell are yours to command,
should you wish to strike.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.857
You wish to invade the Dreaming?

40:42.940 --> 40:44.775
If you command it.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.736
And then perhaps the waking world?

40:48.863 --> 40:53.742
And one day, even the Silver City.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.327
Precisely.

40:55.911 --> 40:58.456
Since none of us may leave Hell,

40:58.539 --> 41:04.086
we may as well expand its borders
until Hell is all there is.

41:05.671 --> 41:08.924
You have given us
much to think about, Azazel.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.635
I would ask
you do more than think.

41:11.719 --> 41:14.597
The generals demand action.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.349
Do they?

41:24.190 --> 41:28.194
Then I shall act. You may tell them.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.488
Excellent.

41:30.571 --> 41:33.324
Good day, Your Majesty.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.662
He is not to be trusted.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.665
No, but he's not wrong.

41:41.749 --> 41:46.420
Then, may I ask, what are you going to do?

41:52.301 --> 41:55.387
Something that I have never done before.

41:58.265 --> 42:03.729
Something that will
make God absolutely livid…

42:06.982 --> 42:09.902
and bring Morpheus to his knees.

42:11.403 --> 42:13.864
Lucifer! Lucifer!

42:14.406 --> 42:16.825
Lucifer! Lucifer!

42:20.079 --> 42:23.499
Lucifer! Lucifer!
Lucifer! Lucifer!
