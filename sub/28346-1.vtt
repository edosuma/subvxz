02:48.349 --> 02:49.649
Thank you for coming, Jake.

02:49.651 --> 02:51.317
It's been...

02:51.319 --> 02:53.387
It's been a long two weeks.

02:53.688 --> 02:58.527
I came here to tell you that Hayes is
willing to forget your resignation.

02:59.493 --> 03:01.195
The CIA is your home.

03:02.496 --> 03:04.799
Defending America is your life.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.201
Jake.

03:07.636 --> 03:09.437
I need you to tell me the truth.

03:10.638 --> 03:12.939
Did you kill Gino Orsetti?

03:12.941 --> 03:15.941
You're asking me questions

03:15.943 --> 03:17.676
that you will never understand.

03:17.678 --> 03:21.213
And they're asking you
to make me come back.

03:21.215 --> 03:23.284
I've been doing this
a lot longer than you.

03:23.884 --> 03:28.254
And I've done a lot of things that
they will never let you know about.

03:29.389 --> 03:32.224
The thing
that offends me the most,

03:32.226 --> 03:35.694
it's not that I've risked
my life for my country

03:35.696 --> 03:38.466
and done things that most
people couldn't have done.

03:39.299 --> 03:43.435
- This country that I love so much...
- <i>Country...</i>

03:43.437 --> 03:47.940
is the real reason
why I feel so betrayed.

03:47.942 --> 03:50.878
That I was lied to
about what they've done...

03:52.679 --> 03:55.683
to us,
to my country.

03:56.517 --> 03:58.917
- Slaughtered.
- <i>Slaughtered.</i>

03:58.919 --> 04:01.352
That's the stuff
they're not telling you.

04:01.354 --> 04:05.390
Where we have literally two governments
inside a government.

04:05.392 --> 04:08.829
Nobody would've thought,
20 years ago if I would've told them,

04:09.429 --> 04:10.796
what's gonna happen now.

04:10.798 --> 04:12.563
Did you kill Orsetti?

04:12.565 --> 04:15.535
Don't ask me what I did...

04:16.569 --> 04:17.805
how I did it,

04:18.271 --> 04:21.474
or any of this bullshit
about "It's my home."

04:24.444 --> 04:26.479
When you know
what I know...

04:27.480 --> 04:29.214
you wouldn't call it
your home either.

04:31.251 --> 04:32.318
I'm done.

05:02.581 --> 05:04.316
She's here. Red dress.

05:16.628 --> 05:18.530
All right, we see her.

05:28.539 --> 05:30.007
Just pinged her phone.

05:30.009 --> 05:32.509
We've got GPS
and all calls and texts.

05:32.511 --> 05:33.479
All right.

05:50.561 --> 05:53.096
- Check that out, bro.
- She's out of your league, man.

05:53.098 --> 05:55.834
No way.
I guarantee you I can.

06:00.371 --> 06:01.305
Fifty bucks, bro.

06:31.103 --> 06:32.701
<i>That's her, Zach.</i>

06:32.703 --> 06:34.906
<i>Red dress. It's showtime.</i>

06:39.609 --> 06:41.311
Let's see how long this takes.

06:47.618 --> 06:48.684
Hello, uh...

06:48.686 --> 06:50.552
- What's up?
- Just, uh, uh...

06:50.554 --> 06:52.587
Okay, all right,
how much for...

06:52.589 --> 06:54.156
I mean, a girl so beautiful?

06:54.158 --> 06:56.125
- Three hundred, two hours.
- Ouch. Really?

06:56.127 --> 06:58.060
- That's...
- I do...

06:58.062 --> 07:01.030
- Uh-huh?
- Everything, every way.

07:01.032 --> 07:01.932
Oh.

07:02.133 --> 07:03.865
Whatever you like.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.535
- So, tell me...
- Uh-huh.

07:06.504 --> 07:08.536
- Can we go the whole night?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

07:08.538 --> 07:11.140
- There's a hotel next door, okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

07:11.142 --> 07:14.010
That didn't take long.

07:21.185 --> 07:22.519
Perfect.

07:25.589 --> 07:27.121
All right, game is on, guys.

07:27.123 --> 07:28.024
Copy.

07:40.703 --> 07:42.806
<i>Lopez, they're on approach.</i>

07:45.876 --> 07:46.910
Watch me work.

07:48.677 --> 07:49.678
Hey, baby.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.513
How about a ride?

07:54.050 --> 07:55.418
- Sure, sweetie.
- Yeah.

08:01.657 --> 08:03.023
Missed your calling, bro.

08:04.593 --> 08:06.027
<i>Lopez.</i>

08:06.029 --> 08:07.831
- You good?
- <i>All good.</i>

08:12.835 --> 08:16.837
Hey, Danilo.
How you doing tonight? All good?

08:16.839 --> 08:18.172
Can you pass me the 225?

08:18.174 --> 08:20.076
And, my love, pay.

08:21.644 --> 08:23.076
- How much?
- Forty bucks.

08:23.078 --> 08:24.113
Forty bucks.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.918
<i>Guys,
hold back till we have eyes on Vincenzo.</i>

08:30.153 --> 08:32.087
<i>Copy that.
We'll be waiting close by.</i>

08:34.089 --> 08:35.857
Zach's eye cam is live.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.467
Room 225.

08:47.102 --> 08:47.937
<i>Baby,</i>

08:48.736 --> 08:50.170
<i>why don't you just go
freshen up?</i>

08:50.172 --> 08:51.839
<i>I'm gonna pour
some drinks for us.</i>

08:52.974 --> 08:53.876
Okay.

09:02.016 --> 09:03.618
<i>Take the pill, son.</i>

09:04.285 --> 09:06.454
The effect is good
for ten minutes.

09:06.689 --> 09:07.622
<i>That's it.</i>

09:34.749 --> 09:36.217
<i>I was missing you already.</i>

09:36.985 --> 09:38.485
<i>Why don't you take a drink?</i>

09:39.287 --> 09:40.286
<i>Drink, baby.</i>

09:40.288 --> 09:41.589
<i>Why don't you take this?</i>

09:42.257 --> 09:43.257
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

09:44.258 --> 09:45.493
<i>Cheers.</i>

09:46.894 --> 09:48.327
<i>Why don't you
just finish it?</i>

09:48.329 --> 09:49.694
<i>All right.
Down the hatch.</i>

09:49.696 --> 09:50.797
<i>Cheers, my love.</i>

09:52.166 --> 09:54.669
<i>Strong drink.</i>

09:55.303 --> 09:56.536
Ah...

09:57.205 --> 09:58.538
<i>And then...</i>

09:59.606 --> 10:01.908
<i>Lay in bed. I have
a little surprise for you.</i>

10:19.693 --> 10:21.129
<i>Guys, this is getting real.</i>

10:51.124 --> 10:53.059
She sent the text.

10:53.660 --> 10:54.561
Perfect.

11:13.679 --> 11:15.112
All right,
they're on approach.

11:15.114 --> 11:16.315
Get ready.

12:35.260 --> 12:36.961
Hey, what do you want?

12:43.034 --> 12:44.135
You got my money?

12:46.204 --> 12:49.172
- What time tomorrow?
- Same time.

12:49.174 --> 12:51.008
- What bar?
- I'll text you.

13:10.928 --> 13:12.260
- Hey, I'm lost.
- Hey.

13:12.262 --> 13:13.962
Can you tell me where 312 is?

13:13.964 --> 13:16.300
Yes, you just have to go...

13:20.471 --> 13:22.438
Okay.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.372
- You need to hit the treadmill, old man.
- No, I'm good.

13:24.374 --> 13:26.208
I'm just tired from
screwing your mom all night.

13:54.571 --> 13:56.273
Hey, you,
get the fuck out of here.

14:05.415 --> 14:07.017
Tony, everything okay?

14:26.835 --> 14:28.170
Ah, shit.

14:34.243 --> 14:35.211
<i>Rocco.</i>

14:36.112 --> 14:37.246
Everything's okay. Go out.

14:40.148 --> 14:41.385
Yes, of course.

14:42.351 --> 14:44.084
I think I heard something.

14:44.086 --> 14:46.055
<i>Go get your position. Go!</i>

15:07.109 --> 15:09.443
It's back online.

15:09.445 --> 15:10.845
Guys, this is getting real.

15:11.313 --> 15:13.114
Looks like
they're about to go to work.

15:14.949 --> 15:16.184
All right. Game's on.

15:37.205 --> 15:38.506
Upstairs. Up the stairs.

15:55.056 --> 15:57.592
What the fuck are you doing?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

16:06.134 --> 16:07.901
I'll break his fucking neck!

16:08.503 --> 16:10.438
Let him go,
or I'll blow your head off!

17:11.732 --> 17:13.696
I'll snap his fucking neck!

17:13.699 --> 17:15.367
<i>Let him go,
or I'll blow your head off!</i>

17:16.068 --> 17:18.137
<i>Zach's awake. He's in trouble.</i>

17:18.771 --> 17:20.539
Fuck you!

17:20.540 --> 17:21.608
<i>Vincenzo's got a gun on him.</i>

17:22.575 --> 17:23.976
Let him go!

17:27.313 --> 17:29.616
I got your man. Who are you?

17:30.349 --> 17:31.585
Put it down!

17:32.018 --> 17:33.417
- What do you want?
- Calm down.

17:33.419 --> 17:34.618
Drop the gun, motherfucker!
Drop it now!

17:34.620 --> 17:36.220
Fuck you!

17:36.222 --> 17:38.054
Put it down!
I just want to talk.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.356
Fuck you!

17:39.358 --> 17:40.724
We don't want you.
We want Orsetti.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.361
Drop the gun, motherfucker!

17:42.729 --> 17:44.228
<i>I'll make you a deal.</i>

17:44.230 --> 17:45.496
You want to make a deal?

17:45.498 --> 17:46.497
<i>We can make a deal.</i>

17:46.499 --> 17:47.765
Who are you?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.633
<i>Let's make a deal!
Put the gun down!</i>

17:49.635 --> 17:52.235
- You want me to sell out my boss?
- Put it down!

17:52.237 --> 17:54.538
- Let's make a deal?
- Put the fucking gun down!

17:56.242 --> 17:58.311
No, Zach! Zach!

17:59.378 --> 18:00.680
Zach!

18:02.080 --> 18:03.048
<i>Zach!</i>

18:03.748 --> 18:06.519
Zach. Zach! Zach!

18:06.819 --> 18:08.086
Zach!

18:12.825 --> 18:14.693
Zach!

18:19.130 --> 18:20.198
Zach.

18:38.583 --> 18:43.088
Were you or were you not in
a relationship with Agent Stevens?

18:43.555 --> 18:45.288
Even though Alexander
trained you,

18:45.290 --> 18:47.857
I'm the one that authorized
your release.

18:47.859 --> 18:50.158
I am going to make your life
a living hell

18:50.160 --> 18:54.065
unless you tell me everything I need
to know about Orsetti's organization.

18:57.335 --> 18:58.468
Answer me, Dekker!

18:58.470 --> 18:59.836
You know what?

18:59.838 --> 19:02.404
You're really wasting my time.

19:02.406 --> 19:05.708
You don't seem to understand
the chain of command here.

19:05.710 --> 19:08.212
You're an asset. That's it.

19:08.713 --> 19:13.181
I will throw your ass back in jail so
fast you won't even know what hit you.

19:13.183 --> 19:16.220
You are in a CIA office.

20:26.322 --> 20:27.290
Don Gino.

20:27.557 --> 20:28.823
Santi, what do you want?

20:28.825 --> 20:29.893
You got to see this.

20:31.327 --> 20:34.462
What is so important that it can't
wait till I finish my breakfast?

20:34.464 --> 20:36.165
We got a problem in Cambodia.

20:42.572 --> 20:45.642
Kid, why you got this dead face?

20:46.342 --> 20:48.308
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

20:48.310 --> 20:50.543
You got your head
just to separate your ears?

20:50.545 --> 20:51.714
Did you call Vinnie?

20:52.648 --> 20:53.616
He doesn't answer.

20:59.822 --> 21:00.857
Everything is okay.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.824
Call our man
at the Phnom Penh police station

21:04.826 --> 21:06.396
and see what happened.

21:06.863 --> 21:08.163
You got it?

21:08.965 --> 21:09.866
Okay.

21:18.941 --> 21:19.809
Bruno.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.611
He didn't find a fuck.

21:22.811 --> 21:25.881
Look on the Internet.
We don't have time to waste.

21:27.516 --> 21:30.285
They are not like us.
They are not to be trusted.

21:32.587 --> 21:33.889
See what you find.

21:34.589 --> 21:35.855
Okay.

21:35.857 --> 21:37.258
I'll wait for you.

21:47.936 --> 21:49.336
How was your flight?

21:50.872 --> 21:51.773
Good.

21:55.677 --> 21:57.311
Have you found out anything?

21:58.279 --> 21:59.380
Nothing at all.

22:01.016 --> 22:02.783
Nobody knows who did this.

22:03.018 --> 22:04.485
They are professionals.

22:05.754 --> 22:09.591
Mr. Orsetti is very worried
about the situation.

22:14.862 --> 22:17.365
He's expecting a response
from you soon.

22:18.967 --> 22:19.901
I know.

22:22.436 --> 22:24.405
I have arranged for you
to meet the girl.

22:24.872 --> 22:26.474
Has she said anything?

22:27.742 --> 22:28.642
Nothing.

22:29.745 --> 22:31.443
She is terrified.

22:31.445 --> 22:33.512
We are supposed
to transfer her in the morning

22:33.514 --> 22:34.949
to a federal prison.

22:39.319 --> 22:41.890
I need just a couple of minutes
alone with her.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.062
Who are you?

23:28.433 --> 23:29.703
I work for Orsetti.

23:31.838 --> 23:33.040
What did you tell them?

23:34.073 --> 23:35.540
Nothing.

23:35.542 --> 23:36.509
Anything.

23:37.777 --> 23:39.311
What's gonna happen now?

23:39.779 --> 23:40.711
Don't worry.

23:40.713 --> 23:42.482
Everything will be okay.

23:44.651 --> 23:45.985
I'm gonna show you something.

23:58.998 --> 24:00.099
No.

24:01.301 --> 24:03.635
My mother, no.
My mother, no.

24:08.875 --> 24:10.009
Not my mama.

24:18.051 --> 24:19.085
Do the right thing...

24:20.119 --> 24:21.787
and your mother will be okay.

24:56.488 --> 24:57.388
It's me.

24:58.023 --> 24:58.924
It's done.

25:09.067 --> 25:12.503
Do we know who the son
of a bitch is that caused this mess?

25:13.671 --> 25:15.139
This piece of shit.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.542
I want to know who it is.

25:17.976 --> 25:19.776
<i>Nobody knows.</i>

25:19.778 --> 25:22.147
<i>Mao Mao says
it's a professional job.</i>

25:22.947 --> 25:26.017
<i>And now the secretary
has someone high up.</i>

25:27.685 --> 25:29.718
- I'm coming.
- <i>Quickly, please.</i>

25:29.720 --> 25:31.489
I told you that I'm coming.

25:32.556 --> 25:33.791
I'll take care of it.

25:35.126 --> 25:39.061
Tell Mao to hold that answer
until I arrive.

25:39.063 --> 25:40.865
- You got it?
- <i>I got it.</i>

25:42.034 --> 25:43.168
Take care.

25:59.582 --> 26:01.018
The first thing I want to say...

26:01.985 --> 26:03.486
is that I'm genuinely sorry...

26:04.588 --> 26:06.057
for the loss of Agent Stevens.

26:07.124 --> 26:08.591
I know
that he was your partner.

26:10.794 --> 26:12.163
I know that he was your friend.

26:14.564 --> 26:16.166
And I know that he was
a trusted colleague.

26:19.103 --> 26:20.570
But I am here to tell you...

26:21.604 --> 26:23.039
that you're being reassigned.

26:25.942 --> 26:29.246
The agency is restructuring
the Southeast operation.

26:29.746 --> 26:32.183
It's going to be much more
corporate from now on.

26:33.016 --> 26:35.185
There's no more room
for cowboys.

26:36.186 --> 26:38.188
The agency is changing.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.757
And the orders from higher up...

26:42.293 --> 26:45.626
are that you all are no longer what
they're looking for in Southeast Asia.

26:45.628 --> 26:46.763
This is bullshit.

26:47.630 --> 26:49.097
What about Orsetti?

26:49.099 --> 26:50.999
Orsetti is
no longer your business.

26:51.001 --> 26:52.936
You had your chance
with Orsetti.

26:53.636 --> 26:57.573
You guys lost your chance
when you lost Agent Stevens.

26:58.308 --> 27:01.144
That scumbag
killed one of our own.

27:03.346 --> 27:04.814
Zach was my best friend.

27:06.149 --> 27:09.152
But we're still part of the agency.
We have to follow orders.

27:09.651 --> 27:13.120
But you're willing to disobey orders
if the operation calls for it, right?

27:13.122 --> 27:14.955
No, bending the rules
is one thing.

27:14.957 --> 27:18.128
Disobeying a direct order
is something else entirely.

27:18.828 --> 27:22.163
Yeah, well, if we leave now, guys, we're
gonna lose everything we have on Orsetti.

27:22.165 --> 27:25.701
You don't actually hold
that information yourself.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.436
The company
has that information.

27:28.370 --> 27:32.574
And we will be able to move forward
in a different way in the future.

27:32.941 --> 27:36.710
How many more innocent people will
get butchered if we leave now?

27:36.712 --> 27:38.178
So what do you suggest, Anna?

27:38.180 --> 27:40.347
We don't accept reassignment.

27:40.349 --> 27:42.185
We stay here and finish this.

27:42.818 --> 27:46.219
For those of you who would like
to follow the orders

27:46.221 --> 27:48.021
that we have been given,

27:48.023 --> 27:49.990
we will be getting on the jet,

27:49.992 --> 27:51.957
and we will head back to Langley

27:51.959 --> 27:56.965
where you will be retrained
and reassigned... separately.

27:58.367 --> 28:00.235
This team is being disbanded.

28:01.869 --> 28:04.673
You will no
longer work together.

28:05.707 --> 28:07.743
The plane is at 0900.

28:08.043 --> 28:10.179
I expect to see
each of you there.

28:10.711 --> 28:13.112
You know what? You guys
can do whatever you want.

28:13.114 --> 28:15.883
I'm going after Orsetti
with or without you.

28:18.287 --> 28:19.819
I'm not an agent.

28:19.821 --> 28:21.654
I'm just an asset, all right?

28:21.656 --> 28:23.256
So if you want me
to leave with you,

28:23.258 --> 28:25.326
you're gonna have
to throw my ass back in jail.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.828
I'm leaving, guys.

28:33.268 --> 28:35.670
Asia's my home.
I'm not leaving.

28:44.312 --> 28:45.246
She's right.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.713
If the agency wants us
out of Asia, we're out.

28:48.715 --> 28:49.984
There's nothing more
to talk about.

28:51.685 --> 28:52.620
I'll be there.

29:01.895 --> 29:05.633
If we leave now,
then Zach's death means nothing.

29:16.376 --> 29:17.845
So you don't like cowboys.

29:24.184 --> 29:25.085
Jake.

29:26.319 --> 29:28.153
Whatever you decide,
I'm with you.

29:28.155 --> 29:29.357
It's your call, mate.

29:30.158 --> 29:32.056
But if we leave now,

29:32.058 --> 29:35.862
we're gonna lose everything we
have on that scumbag Orsetti.

30:21.208 --> 30:22.275
Yeah, it's me.

30:24.243 --> 30:25.377
I, uh...

30:26.245 --> 30:27.313
can't come now.

30:30.849 --> 30:31.984
I don't know yet.

30:34.521 --> 30:36.222
Maybe not for a few weeks.

30:39.525 --> 30:40.427
Sorry.

31:38.583 --> 31:40.182
Fuck you!

31:40.184 --> 31:41.953
Let's make a deal?

32:33.103 --> 32:35.305
I lost a good friend, Father.

32:37.441 --> 32:39.008
I'm sorry to hear that.

32:40.478 --> 32:42.979
We will pray
for his eternal repose.

32:44.981 --> 32:46.283
I've sinned again...

32:47.517 --> 32:48.418
Father.

32:53.490 --> 32:55.525
I took a man's life.

33:11.675 --> 33:12.908
<i>Zach!</i>

33:17.147 --> 33:19.048
- You okay, hon?
- Yeah.

33:19.549 --> 33:21.050
I'm making some coffee.

33:22.017 --> 33:24.186
Fuck the coffee, Charlie.
Just get me a whiskey.

33:24.520 --> 33:26.255
Okay. You got it.

34:07.062 --> 34:08.963
I'm not sure what to say,
Sonia.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.331
Do you want to talk about it?

34:12.333 --> 34:14.536
There's nothing to say.

34:15.570 --> 34:19.641
I was beginning to suspect,
but... but I didn't know.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.076
None of us did.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.312
He said we shouldn't
tell anybody.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.217
He didn't want
to break protocol.

34:29.016 --> 34:30.453
Zach was a good man.

34:31.351 --> 34:32.487
We all loved him.

34:34.222 --> 34:35.556
Not like I did, Anna.

34:37.091 --> 34:40.761
I didn't even know I
could love until I met Zach.

34:43.398 --> 34:46.100
The whole of last year
doesn't even seem real.

34:46.601 --> 34:49.637
Me, a con girl...

34:50.705 --> 34:54.742
come out of jail...
turn CIA asset.

34:55.510 --> 35:00.280
Then I came here, and Zach...

35:03.317 --> 35:04.818
He gave me hope.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.623
I should've been there,
you know? I...

35:10.625 --> 35:13.091
There was little things
I could've done.

35:13.093 --> 35:15.562
I... I could've saved him.

35:16.064 --> 35:17.732
You couldn't do
anything about it.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.267
There's nothing you could do.

35:22.536 --> 35:23.504
Hey.

35:25.339 --> 35:27.374
How am I gonna survive this?

35:30.077 --> 35:32.446
We'll get through this, okay?

35:32.814 --> 35:34.147
Together.

35:34.816 --> 35:37.084
Our team is your family now.

35:38.185 --> 35:39.753
Zach would want you
to know that.

35:48.395 --> 35:50.029
What was that bullshit
with Thompson?

35:55.302 --> 35:56.635
I'm talking to you.

35:56.637 --> 35:58.405
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

35:59.506 --> 36:01.040
You're meant to be one of us.

36:01.542 --> 36:03.075
What the fuck
is one of us, man?

36:03.609 --> 36:05.744
You're meant to be part
of the same family.

36:05.746 --> 36:07.579
What the fuck
is the family, man?

36:07.581 --> 36:10.147
The people who've been looking
after you all these years.

36:10.149 --> 36:12.351
Yeah,
like we looked after Zach.

36:14.186 --> 36:15.621
Zach knew the risks.

36:19.191 --> 36:20.561
You're angry, aren't you?

36:23.362 --> 36:24.263
Hey.

36:25.598 --> 36:26.699
We're all angry.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.601
- Now grow up.
- Oh, come on.

36:29.603 --> 36:30.869
And deal with it!

36:33.239 --> 36:35.739
Don't you remember?
Jake took you in.

36:35.741 --> 36:37.908
Man, he's had enough.
He's gonna get us all killed.

36:37.910 --> 36:39.743
You little Marine shit.

36:42.214 --> 36:44.216
We're not doing this today.

36:50.623 --> 36:52.091
Now calm down.

36:52.759 --> 36:54.625
You know what Jake's
going through?

36:54.627 --> 36:55.795
We're all going through it!

36:56.662 --> 36:58.729
Now pull yourself together.

36:58.731 --> 36:59.432
Stay down!

37:00.600 --> 37:02.599
And I expect to see you
tomorrow.

37:02.601 --> 37:04.203
I'm done with this shit!

37:04.938 --> 37:06.606
Be a man and not a boy.

37:09.642 --> 37:10.810
Grow up!

37:28.794 --> 37:30.761
Benton wants
to meet up later. You down?

37:30.763 --> 37:34.497
Nope. Not tonight.
I'm, uh, just gonna take it easy.

37:34.499 --> 37:36.199
Take it ea...
Since when do you take it easy?

37:36.201 --> 37:37.802
Don't look at me like that.

37:38.470 --> 37:39.902
What is this?
You holding out on me?

37:39.904 --> 37:41.306
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

37:42.641 --> 37:44.809
I'll catch you tomorrow, buddy, huh?
I'm out of here.

37:47.312 --> 37:48.212
All right.

38:02.292 --> 38:04.596
I fight evil every day, Father.

38:07.966 --> 38:11.335
And I feel like I'm losing
myself to the dark side.

38:13.303 --> 38:15.572
Have faith in God's wisdom.

38:16.474 --> 38:19.744
I don't know
what God has in store for me.

38:20.845 --> 38:23.614
God has plans
for all of us...

38:24.581 --> 38:25.716
and for you.

38:28.853 --> 38:31.319
No!

38:31.321 --> 38:32.587
Please! I'm begging you!

38:32.589 --> 38:34.256
Don't be stubborn,
you'll get hurt!

38:34.258 --> 38:35.559
- Don't do this to me!
- Hey!

38:36.760 --> 38:37.461
- Hey! Let her go!
- Come on, you whore!

38:38.729 --> 38:40.598
What? Stay out of this!

38:47.037 --> 38:50.239
- Are you hurt? Go home.
- Thank you, ma'am.

39:45.561 --> 39:46.896
It's good to see you, Jake.

39:47.563 --> 39:49.464
So what brings you to Hong Kong?

39:50.099 --> 39:53.400
Well, I have some stuff going on,
and I thought I could use your help.

39:53.402 --> 39:55.503
I know that I...

39:55.505 --> 39:59.673
passed up your offer on running your
security operations before, last year.

40:01.043 --> 40:03.043
Yes, unfortunately, you did.

40:03.045 --> 40:05.846
But you know what? Things change.

40:05.848 --> 40:06.983
Now we have something better.

40:07.784 --> 40:09.484
I have a proposition for you.

40:09.919 --> 40:12.119
Okay, I am all ears.

40:12.121 --> 40:14.589
I'd like to you to fund...

40:15.124 --> 40:17.558
and start up
a special company for me.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.993
Start up?

40:18.995 --> 40:22.597
Jake, at your age?

40:22.932 --> 40:27.602
Recently one of my guys...
was killed on the last mission.

40:29.404 --> 40:31.071
Kid's been with me
for a long time.

40:31.073 --> 40:32.873
He was like a son to me.
I really loved him.

40:32.875 --> 40:33.875
I see.

40:34.976 --> 40:37.610
So you want revenge?

40:37.612 --> 40:40.348
Revenge is for young guys.

40:41.449 --> 40:45.152
This is about something
much bigger than revenge.

40:45.154 --> 40:47.022
It's about what's right
in the world.

40:48.623 --> 40:51.623
CIA wants us out of here,
wants us out of Asia.

40:51.625 --> 40:52.761
We're just not gonna do that.

40:53.461 --> 40:54.996
Why don't you come
work for me, huh?

40:56.464 --> 40:59.599
I pay you six figures, and you are
going to have a beautiful life.

40:59.601 --> 41:01.767
You're gonna be my boss,

41:01.769 --> 41:04.470
and you're gonna have
six guys working under me.

41:04.472 --> 41:07.740
Now we're talking.

41:07.742 --> 41:10.475
So, how much
are we talking about?

41:10.477 --> 41:13.912
Uh, I... I need about $5 million
to start up the company.

41:13.914 --> 41:16.883
Five million.

41:16.885 --> 41:18.618
I would say...

41:18.620 --> 41:21.722
So it's a very much
elite, elite agency, right?

41:23.490 --> 41:24.992
Jake, look.

41:25.726 --> 41:29.396
After my father died, you saved my
life, and I never forget this.

41:31.066 --> 41:33.732
You will have the money
on one condition.

41:33.734 --> 41:37.502
I become a full partner
in this whole deal.

41:37.504 --> 41:38.871
- Okay.
- Full on.

41:38.873 --> 41:40.006
Deal.

41:40.008 --> 41:41.573
I will finance

41:41.575 --> 41:43.209
a beautiful,
beautiful office for you.

41:43.211 --> 41:45.077
We'll make it very stylish

41:45.079 --> 41:46.945
because I think you're
gonna need a lot of help

41:46.947 --> 41:48.849
now that you'll be financed
by a woman.

41:49.482 --> 41:50.916
It's true.

41:50.918 --> 41:53.785
So, where do you want
this office.

41:53.787 --> 41:55.687
Uh, Bangkok?

41:55.689 --> 41:56.757
Manila.

41:58.893 --> 42:00.861
Did you know that I own
some property there?

42:01.195 --> 42:03.527
That does not surprise me.

42:03.529 --> 42:04.465
Listen.

42:05.032 --> 42:06.965
Why don't you call your guys?

42:06.967 --> 42:09.103
Tell them that I'm sending
the plane for them.

42:09.770 --> 42:11.537
Thank you very much.

42:11.972 --> 42:15.441
And you and I will cruise
on my beautiful yacht,

42:15.943 --> 42:18.411
and we'll meet them in Manila.

42:19.013 --> 42:21.748
I like the sound of
it, partner.

42:22.216 --> 42:24.450
Cheers.

42:32.659 --> 42:35.192
Where is Jake?
Where is Jake?

42:35.194 --> 42:36.596
Where is Alexander?

42:38.831 --> 42:40.564
Where is Jake?

42:40.566 --> 42:42.833
<i>Where is Alexander?</i>

42:42.835 --> 42:44.635
I don't know where he is.

42:44.637 --> 42:47.707
- Where is Alexander?
- I don't know where he is!

42:49.943 --> 42:51.010
<i>You're lying to me.</i>

42:51.543 --> 42:53.111
I'm your CIA handler.

42:53.113 --> 42:55.247
You think I don't know you
inside and out?

42:55.249 --> 42:56.916
<i>You know where he is.</i>

42:57.250 --> 42:58.983
You're lying to me.

42:58.985 --> 42:59.986
Harrison.

43:01.887 --> 43:04.189
I want answers.

43:04.191 --> 43:05.756
You're my straight arrow.

43:05.758 --> 43:07.459
You're the guy
that always follows by the book.

43:09.262 --> 43:10.930
These guys don't play
by the rules.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.865
You know,
the book doesn't work.

43:15.133 --> 43:16.867
The rules have changed.

43:16.869 --> 43:19.136
Yeah, the world's changed.
We're too far behind.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.805
Help me do something about it.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.672
Instead of reassigning us
somewhere else...

43:22.674 --> 43:24.874
I'm trying, but every damn one
of you is standing in my way.

43:24.876 --> 43:25.911
Finish the...

43:28.614 --> 43:30.482
Finish the mission.

43:33.585 --> 43:35.654
They killed Zach, Thompson!

43:36.755 --> 43:39.790
Help me do something about it.
Where is Alexander?

43:39.792 --> 43:41.891
I don't know where he is!

43:41.893 --> 43:44.161
And if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

43:44.163 --> 43:48.631
Now, if we're gonna be much longer,
I'm gonna need a burger or something,

43:48.633 --> 43:49.968
'cause I'm starving.

43:50.302 --> 43:51.203
We done?

44:00.811 --> 44:02.644
Cheers!

44:02.646 --> 44:03.913
Cheers!

44:03.915 --> 44:05.550
To old memories, old times.

44:05.917 --> 44:08.018
Milan, but especially Paris.

44:08.020 --> 44:10.220
Do you remember Paris?

44:10.222 --> 44:11.787
What we did in Paris?

44:11.789 --> 44:12.888
No, no, no, no.

44:14.725 --> 44:16.793
You were tremendous.

44:16.795 --> 44:18.228
Very good.

44:18.230 --> 44:20.930
- Really good.
- What does it remind you of?

44:20.932 --> 44:22.631
- Oh, pasta.
- Oh, pasta.

44:22.633 --> 44:24.033
- Finally.
- Great.

44:24.035 --> 44:25.768
We are Italians.
If we don't eat pasta...

44:25.770 --> 44:26.969
Good, good, yes.

44:26.971 --> 44:28.238
The other surprise
I have for you...

44:28.240 --> 44:29.239
she's my daughter.

44:30.608 --> 44:33.209
- My pleasure.
- Giada.

44:33.211 --> 44:34.777
- You are beautiful.
- Thank you.

44:34.779 --> 44:36.378
- She's Italian.
- Eh...

44:36.380 --> 44:39.851
It's best you go to the
customers waiting for you, okay?

44:41.353 --> 44:42.818
Thank you.

44:42.820 --> 44:44.119
And now? Now the pasta.

44:44.121 --> 44:46.055
Yes, a bit of pasta.

44:46.057 --> 44:47.024
Come on.

44:48.125 --> 44:49.358
Come on, Santino.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.660
- Come on, Santino.
- Thank you.

44:51.662 --> 44:54.129
- Isn't it too much, Santino?
- Yes, Santino is hungry.

44:54.131 --> 44:56.732
It's too good.
I'm gonna have some more.

44:56.734 --> 44:58.702
Mao, my friend.

44:59.270 --> 45:01.038
Ciao.
Long time we don't see you.

45:03.340 --> 45:06.577
I have to go to the other customers.
Just talk about business.

45:06.977 --> 45:07.878
Please.

45:24.227 --> 45:26.096
How long you been
working for me...

45:27.063 --> 45:27.965
now?

45:28.365 --> 45:29.766
Almost two years, huh?

45:31.168 --> 45:32.136
Yes, sir.

45:35.439 --> 45:39.740
And how much money have you make
during this time?

45:39.742 --> 45:41.278
$300,000.

45:47.817 --> 45:48.952
Not bad, huh?

45:49.685 --> 45:52.087
So, for that kind of money,

45:52.089 --> 45:54.391
I expect a response now.

45:56.226 --> 45:58.328
I have a very simple question
for you.

46:00.130 --> 46:01.397
Who killed my men?

46:03.467 --> 46:05.034
Nobody's talking now.

46:07.003 --> 46:08.670
These people are not from here.

46:09.305 --> 46:12.007
So, basically,
you come to see me,

46:12.774 --> 46:14.109
and you have no answer for me.

46:15.344 --> 46:17.914
You are like a
fork in the soup. Useless.

47:30.085 --> 47:31.186
Hello?

47:31.386 --> 47:32.387
It's me.

47:33.988 --> 47:35.423
He's back in Bangkok.

47:39.327 --> 47:40.895
We've got a short window.

47:42.397 --> 47:44.131
Do what needs to be done.

47:47.568 --> 47:48.869
Yes, sir.

48:42.055 --> 48:43.323
Hi. How you doing?

48:44.592 --> 48:47.193
Hey, you cannot go inside.

48:47.594 --> 48:49.327
- Speak English?
- No.

50:15.682 --> 50:17.047
<i>Hayes.</i>

50:17.049 --> 50:19.318
<i>Listen to me, you motherfucker.</i>

50:20.152 --> 50:25.154
I know all of your fucking immoral,
dirty, rotten, criminal shit,

50:25.156 --> 50:26.324
and I don't care.

50:26.991 --> 50:28.625
I got my own fish to fry.

50:28.627 --> 50:31.661
<i>You sent somebody to kill me,
and you missed.</i>

50:31.663 --> 50:33.331
<i>You know what that means.</i>

50:34.031 --> 50:37.433
You make another fucking move
or blink the wrong way,

50:37.435 --> 50:38.601
I will kill you.

50:38.603 --> 50:40.404
I will kill your fucking mother.

50:40.406 --> 50:42.306
I will kill your fucking dog.

50:49.313 --> 50:51.314
You're in Marbella now.
You have to learn this.

50:51.316 --> 50:54.051
I just said,
"What beautiful eyes."

50:55.353 --> 50:57.155
- Cheers, mama.
- Cheers.

51:06.097 --> 51:08.032
- Yes?
- <i>Hi, Alberto.</i>

51:08.566 --> 51:10.366
<i>Long time no speak.</i>

51:10.368 --> 51:11.333
Tom.

51:11.335 --> 51:13.036
<i>Tom Benton.</i>

51:14.471 --> 51:15.036
- Hello, friend.
- Are you here in Marbella?

51:15.038 --> 51:17.074
I need to ask a favor.

51:18.009 --> 51:19.243
Ah.

51:19.510 --> 51:22.012
Are you still friends
with the Camorra Mafia?

51:23.013 --> 51:24.147
Yes.

51:25.215 --> 51:26.550
I need to get in touch
with a guy called Orsetti.

51:27.050 --> 51:29.318
- I know him.
- <i>We need a meeting with him.</i>

51:29.320 --> 51:33.256
I have a very unique product
for a very special customer.

51:33.558 --> 51:35.492
I'll send you the details
via WhatsApp.

51:36.293 --> 51:37.358
All right.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.793
Time is the essence, mate.

51:38.795 --> 51:40.196
Let me know if it's possible.

51:40.198 --> 51:41.262
<i>Okay.</i>

51:41.264 --> 51:42.598
It'd be good to see you.

51:42.600 --> 51:43.668
I'll see you soon.

51:44.769 --> 51:45.669
Bye, my friend.

53:12.721 --> 53:15.422
All right, good morning, everybody.
We're starting our first operation,

53:15.424 --> 53:17.324
which is an intel-gathering op.

53:17.326 --> 53:20.159
We are doing this one
from scratch.

53:20.161 --> 53:23.329
Orsetti was part of the Neapolitan
Camorra crime syndicate.

53:23.331 --> 53:25.598
For the last two years,
he's been off the radar.

53:25.600 --> 53:27.801
This is Orsetti's top dog.

53:27.803 --> 53:32.471
Phnom Penh police chief has confirmed
that he has been assassinated.

53:32.473 --> 53:33.774
Killed in Cambodia.

53:33.776 --> 53:35.508
Then there's
a third unknown person

53:35.510 --> 53:36.842
to Orsetti's
immediate circle,

53:36.844 --> 53:38.878
a computer hacker.

53:38.880 --> 53:41.882
I started tracking him using deep
web sites, but he's since gone dark.

53:41.884 --> 53:46.218
The general public uses search
engines to access indexed results,

53:46.220 --> 53:48.921
mostly certified
and registered web sites.

53:48.923 --> 53:52.093
It's what we commonly refer to
as the World Wide Web.

53:52.460 --> 53:54.327
Then there's the deep web...

53:54.329 --> 53:57.630
databases, software, web sites,
and non-indexed content

53:57.632 --> 54:00.231
that's not accessible
through standard search engines.

54:00.233 --> 54:02.467
This is actually
the majority of the Internet.

54:02.469 --> 54:04.570
Most of this information
is private,

54:04.572 --> 54:06.906
kind of like your network,
Miss Sokolov.

54:06.908 --> 54:08.841
Then there's the dark web.

54:08.843 --> 54:11.677
Think of it like the Mariana
Trench of the Internet.

54:11.679 --> 54:15.681
This content is heavily encrypted
and private network access only.

54:15.683 --> 54:18.784
The dark web is where anonymous
buyers use cryptocurrencies,

54:18.786 --> 54:21.252
<i>like Bitcoin,
Ripple, and Litecoin,</i>

54:21.254 --> 54:24.424
<i>to buy guns, drugs, and organs.</i>

54:25.258 --> 54:27.862
All anonymous, all untraceable.

54:28.429 --> 54:30.930
That's where I lost
track of Orsetti's operation.

54:30.932 --> 54:34.934
At the moment, I can't trace him or
the hacker behind his transactions.

54:34.936 --> 54:36.901
Okay, so right now
I have a play in place.

54:36.903 --> 54:39.237
It's a guy called Alberto.

54:39.239 --> 54:41.574
We have a meeting scheduled
with him immediately.

54:41.576 --> 54:43.477
If we're lucky,
Orsetti will come.

54:43.945 --> 54:46.580
Benton, you remember that guy
we had lunch with in Burma?

54:46.813 --> 54:49.948
See if you can set him up
to deliver some supplies to us.

54:49.950 --> 54:51.184
No problem.

56:25.077 --> 56:28.314
I'm happy you're all here.

56:29.081 --> 56:30.415
Mom, forgive me.

56:31.483 --> 56:33.418
I'm just so busy
with the church.

56:33.651 --> 56:35.286
I know that.

56:37.522 --> 56:40.693
How about you, Maria?
Did you meet someone from abroad?

56:41.493 --> 56:42.995
Now that you're here...

56:44.329 --> 56:46.598
you should think about
staying here for good.

56:47.398 --> 56:49.832
Your father and I,
we're not getting any younger.

56:49.834 --> 56:51.971
Mom,
I really need to stay in Manila.

56:53.638 --> 56:55.974
Why don't you want to stay here?

56:57.041 --> 57:00.643
Mom, you know I have work there.

57:00.645 --> 57:04.616
You should not let your work
take over your life.

57:11.122 --> 57:12.822
Mom, I already told you...

57:12.824 --> 57:15.027
Maria, I'm your mother.

57:16.561 --> 57:19.063
You cannot lie to me!

57:21.032 --> 57:24.334
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

57:24.635 --> 57:25.569
Mom...

57:26.003 --> 57:26.971
What?

57:27.572 --> 57:28.473
Hmm?

57:29.641 --> 57:31.475
I want my family.

57:33.077 --> 57:34.745
We're still family, right?

57:35.579 --> 57:38.983
Family? We're not family!

57:42.419 --> 57:44.855
Yes, I have two children.

57:46.690 --> 57:48.892
I offer one to God.

57:52.462 --> 57:56.800
And the devil took the other.

58:09.980 --> 58:11.949
Thank you
for the adobo and lechon.

58:13.482 --> 58:14.650
Maria.

58:15.019 --> 58:17.354
Dad, I should go.

58:18.455 --> 58:19.388
Maria?

58:21.657 --> 58:22.625
Maria?

58:26.462 --> 58:27.965
Why did you say that?

59:11.673 --> 59:14.110
All right, let's do this.

59:20.216 --> 59:22.849
Command to all teams.
Coms test.

59:22.851 --> 59:24.452
Checking signals now.

59:25.553 --> 59:27.121
First team, check.

59:27.123 --> 59:28.824
<i>Harrison? Check?</i>

59:29.892 --> 59:30.824
Same here.

59:30.826 --> 59:31.994
Lobby's clear.

59:35.864 --> 59:36.798
You know...

59:37.999 --> 59:39.135
this is shitty whiskey.

59:39.902 --> 59:41.536
But it's better than nothing.

59:45.707 --> 59:46.940
All eyes are go.

59:46.942 --> 59:48.543
We have full visuals.

59:49.210 --> 59:50.644
You're clear, guys.

59:51.914 --> 59:54.681
Bike's here.
Maria's in position.

59:54.683 --> 59:56.051
Maria, you good?

59:57.552 --> 59:59.120
All good.

01:00:00.587 --> 01:00:02.757
<i>Satellite PHL
Microsat One is transponding.</i>

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:05.627
Black Chrysler 300...

01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:07.660
turning now.

01:00:07.662 --> 01:00:08.763
The car is approaching.

01:00:15.537 --> 01:00:17.772
Sonia and Alberto
are about to enter the lobby.

01:00:24.745 --> 01:00:26.547
Look alive, guys. They're here.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:30.952
Evening. Happy holidays.
Welcome to the Ascott. Madam.

01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:43.797
Alberto is an important man.

01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:46.164
Orsetti's not gonna
make him wait for long.

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:49.167
He's gonna be watching
to see if anybody follows him.

01:00:49.169 --> 01:00:51.906
So we'll have
to get there first.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.075
- Copy, team?
- <i>Copy.</i>

01:00:55.176 --> 01:00:56.210
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:05.186
- <i>So?</i>
- They're here.

01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:07.955
- <i>They came here.</i>
- Good.

01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:11.089
Be careful. We can't trust them.

01:01:11.091 --> 01:01:13.726
- Call me every ten minutes, got it?
- <i>Yes, I got it.</i>

01:01:14.161 --> 01:01:15.160
Good.

01:01:15.162 --> 01:01:16.764
Every ten minutes.

01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:18.699
Bye. See you.

01:01:39.853 --> 01:01:42.056
Satellite lock, 30th floor.

01:01:52.732 --> 01:01:54.634
Initializing Dekker's eye cam.

01:01:59.272 --> 01:02:00.907
Activated.

01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:13.319
And remind Alberto
it's a nonsmoking room.

01:02:14.954 --> 01:02:16.022
<i>Put the cigar down.</i>

01:02:22.961 --> 01:02:24.361
How well you know this guy?

01:02:24.363 --> 01:02:25.995
Orsetti?

01:02:25.997 --> 01:02:27.100
He's, uh...

01:02:28.267 --> 01:02:29.701
unpredictable.

01:02:31.404 --> 01:02:32.305
He's gonna show?

01:02:33.738 --> 01:02:35.073
You can never tell.

01:02:42.881 --> 01:02:44.448
See anything down there?

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:46.852
Only action
so far is lover boy...

01:02:49.754 --> 01:02:51.257
meeting his next ex-wife.

01:02:52.391 --> 01:02:53.923
What's wrong, my son?

01:02:53.925 --> 01:02:55.294
You know I can multitask.

01:02:56.294 --> 01:02:58.330
Plus, she's got a fantastic ass.

01:03:01.032 --> 01:03:03.467
Come on, old man. She's
young enough to be your granddaughter.

01:03:03.469 --> 01:03:05.336
How many of those pills
you taking a day?

01:03:13.211 --> 01:03:14.346
Evening, sir.

01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:25.254
Cell signal's locked.

01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:32.061
South warehouse,
Yangon 103, 45 minutes.

01:03:32.063 --> 01:03:33.463
<i>Honk the horn at the door.</i>

01:03:33.465 --> 01:03:34.932
- <i>Bring the money.</i>
- All right.

01:03:39.938 --> 01:03:41.872
I'm sending you directions
on the phone.

01:03:42.107 --> 01:03:43.473
Old building near the bridge.

01:03:43.475 --> 01:03:44.942
Coordinates on the way.

01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:46.210
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:03:47.244 --> 01:03:48.379
We're on the move.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.453
Heads up, guys.

01:05:04.455 --> 01:05:06.153
I'm going in now.

01:05:06.155 --> 01:05:07.890
I'm in position. Stand by.

01:05:21.571 --> 01:05:22.869
Benton?

01:05:22.871 --> 01:05:24.505
Is that you at the north gate?

01:05:24.507 --> 01:05:26.909
- <i>You got there fast.</i>
- I took a shortcut.

01:05:27.477 --> 01:05:29.410
I used to date two sisters
in this area.

01:05:29.412 --> 01:05:31.381
Oh, my God.

01:06:20.128 --> 01:06:21.996
Team, take cover.

01:06:22.331 --> 01:06:23.964
Amato is pulling in.

01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:31.906
Copy that.

01:06:38.012 --> 01:06:39.381
What the fuck are you doing?

01:06:40.115 --> 01:06:41.616
Go back and cover the bridge.

01:06:42.351 --> 01:06:44.151
Amato's covering the main gate.

01:06:44.653 --> 01:06:46.987
There's another guard
approaching Lopez.

01:06:48.356 --> 01:06:50.191
Copy.
Moving to the end of the tunnel.

01:07:30.264 --> 01:07:31.465
It's Orsetti.

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:33.900
<i>I repeat,
Orsetti is in the building.</i>

01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:37.702
- Copy that.
- <i>Okay, team, remember.</i>

01:07:37.704 --> 01:07:41.007
We can't move on Orsetti until
Dekker completes the transaction.

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:03.531
Don Gino, it's all good.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.599
A man of your word.

01:08:09.068 --> 01:08:10.537
You never disappoint.

01:08:11.471 --> 01:08:12.971
Then, you always were.

01:08:19.145 --> 01:08:20.613
You like the food
in this country?

01:08:22.214 --> 01:08:24.749
They put peperoncino chili
in everything.

01:08:24.751 --> 01:08:27.220
You cannot even have a coffee
without getting this shit.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.223
It's good to see you, Alberto.

01:08:31.156 --> 01:08:32.057
So.

01:08:32.591 --> 01:08:34.090
A warehouse.

01:08:34.091 --> 01:08:36.359
A bit clandestine,
don't you think?

01:08:36.361 --> 01:08:40.231
Believe me, I would have preferred
to meet you on the beach in Marbella,

01:08:40.233 --> 01:08:44.267
but I use this place to move
some of my art pieces around.

01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:45.402
Hey.

01:08:45.404 --> 01:08:46.671
Can we get this moving, please?

01:08:47.238 --> 01:08:48.505
You have your money.

01:08:48.506 --> 01:08:50.374
My husband's on his deathbed.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.743
When do we get our products?

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.545
Let's hurry up
and then go dance, huh?

01:08:59.117 --> 01:09:00.152
Customer...

01:09:01.152 --> 01:09:03.555
are becoming
so demanding these days.

01:09:07.826 --> 01:09:09.428
To answer your question...

01:09:11.662 --> 01:09:14.031
you're gonna get
your product right now.

01:09:17.536 --> 01:09:20.037
Guys, we got a problem.

01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:21.707
<i>He's got a live body in there.</i>

01:09:27.379 --> 01:09:28.447
Still beating.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:33.451
So you know it's good.

01:09:53.639 --> 01:09:55.741
Hey, dude,
what's wrong with you?

01:09:56.307 --> 01:09:59.475
Hey,
the guy's shitting his pants.

01:09:59.477 --> 01:10:01.242
Don't be an asshole.

01:10:01.244 --> 01:10:03.178
What do you think,
I can just walk in a store

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.448
and pick out a heart for you?

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:07.583
Sit your ass back down

01:10:07.585 --> 01:10:10.686
and see for yourself
how this is done.

01:10:10.688 --> 01:10:12.355
And show some respect.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.095
Sonia needs backup right now.

01:10:18.729 --> 01:10:21.864
Sonia, you need
to create a diversion now.

01:10:21.866 --> 01:10:23.666
<i>Think fast. We're moving.</i>

01:10:23.668 --> 01:10:25.567
<i>Lopez, get into position.</i>

01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:26.771
Wait for Sonia's play.

01:10:27.471 --> 01:10:28.773
Harrison, cover the door.

01:10:34.912 --> 01:10:37.612
- <i>All right, Sonia. Go.</i>
- Shut the fuck up.

01:10:37.614 --> 01:10:39.650
I need this for my husband, okay?

01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:47.188
Go ahead.

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:48.222
Do it.

01:11:21.491 --> 01:11:23.523
Vittorio,
where the fuck are you?

01:11:37.239 --> 01:11:39.175
Harrison, cover the side exit.

01:11:45.547 --> 01:11:46.548
Son of a bitch!

01:11:59.828 --> 01:12:02.697
<i>Rosen, Orsetti's
behind that crate. Where is Lopez?</i>

01:12:02.699 --> 01:12:04.564
Guys, Dekker needs backup now.

01:12:05.969 --> 01:12:07.636
No!

01:12:12.941 --> 01:12:15.444
I don't think you have
any more bullets, bitch.

01:12:17.713 --> 01:12:20.747
Rosen, I'm out of bullets.
Get us out of this.

01:12:20.749 --> 01:12:22.015
Hang on, Sonia.

01:12:22.017 --> 01:12:23.449
<i>Lopez is on the way.</i>

01:12:23.451 --> 01:12:24.719
Come on!

01:12:25.353 --> 01:12:26.255
Bitch.

01:12:27.489 --> 01:12:29.656
- <i>Harrison!</i>
- I'm on my way!

01:12:29.658 --> 01:12:31.325
- <i>Hold on, Dekker.</i>
- You want to fuck with me?

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.593
- Orsetti has Sonia.
- <i>Don't move.</i>

01:12:34.595 --> 01:12:36.328
Don't move! Put your hands up!

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:38.200
- <i>Come here.</i>
- Fuck off!

01:12:38.834 --> 01:12:39.866
Who are you?

01:12:39.868 --> 01:12:42.602
FBI? CIA? Interpol?

01:12:42.604 --> 01:12:44.004
Fuck off. Take that shot!

01:12:44.006 --> 01:12:45.206
Let me take him!

01:12:48.843 --> 01:12:50.546
Vito, take the money.

01:12:52.346 --> 01:12:54.014
- Let the girl go.
- I got the girl!

01:12:54.016 --> 01:12:56.382
- Take the shot!
- Piece of shit!

01:12:56.384 --> 01:12:57.652
Move,
and I'm gonna kill her.

01:13:00.588 --> 01:13:01.489
Go, go, go!

01:13:02.591 --> 01:13:04.423
Piece of shit! I'll kill you!

01:13:04.425 --> 01:13:05.992
You send her as bait to me?

01:13:05.994 --> 01:13:08.761
Let me fucking take him, Jake!
I've got a clear shot, Jake!

01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:10.629
- Piece of shit!
- Don't fucking move!

01:13:10.631 --> 01:13:12.464
- Benton!
- Let the girl go.

01:13:12.466 --> 01:13:13.631
I'm gonna
fucking kill her anyway.

01:13:13.633 --> 01:13:14.569
- Let the girl go.
- Benton!

01:13:15.536 --> 01:13:17.905
Jake! Let me fucking take
the son of a bitch!

01:13:19.507 --> 01:13:21.507
Come on, man,
give me the fucking go!

01:13:21.509 --> 01:13:23.042
- Benton!
- Piece of shit!

01:13:23.044 --> 01:13:25.911
Come on, Jake!
Let me fucking take him!

01:13:25.913 --> 01:13:27.546
- Piece of shit!
- Jake!

01:13:27.548 --> 01:13:29.482
Let me fucking take him!

01:13:29.484 --> 01:13:31.753
Let me blow his fucking head off!
Let me take him!

01:13:32.552 --> 01:13:33.653
Take the shot!

01:13:34.088 --> 01:13:35.687
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:37.290
Fuck you!

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.294
Let me fucking take
the son of a bitch!

01:13:41.796 --> 01:13:43.796
<i>You want to make a deal?</i>

01:13:43.798 --> 01:13:45.599
Drop the gun,
motherfucker! Drop it now!

01:13:46.366 --> 01:13:47.267
Jake?

01:13:56.077 --> 01:13:59.344
<i>Harrison, hold your fire.
Lopez, stand down.</i>

01:13:59.346 --> 01:14:00.377
Shit.

01:14:06.853 --> 01:14:09.053
Shut the fuck up!
I'm gonna kill you right now!

01:14:09.055 --> 01:14:11.591
- <i>Lopez, I said stand down!</i>
- Fuck these guys!

01:14:17.964 --> 01:14:19.533
Son of a bitch!

01:14:22.035 --> 01:14:24.102
Lopez! Jesus!

01:14:24.104 --> 01:14:25.404
Look after Dekker!

01:14:27.674 --> 01:14:28.675
Dekker!

01:14:30.844 --> 01:14:32.442
You okay?

01:14:32.444 --> 01:14:33.880
Yeah. Amato's been hit.

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:38.985
Rosen, I got him.

01:14:45.025 --> 01:14:46.759
<i>Harrison, we're in pursuit.</i>

01:14:47.426 --> 01:14:48.759
Harrison is on the bridge.

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:51.765
Damn.

01:15:20.759 --> 01:15:22.658
Helicopter coming your way.

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.795
Be careful, guys.

01:15:44.984 --> 01:15:46.851
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

01:16:31.996 --> 01:16:33.730
Son of a bitch!

01:16:42.572 --> 01:16:43.573
Piece of shit!

01:17:26.883 --> 01:17:29.553
<i>Where is Jake? Where is Jake?</i>

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.121
<i>Where is Alexander?</i>

01:17:52.876 --> 01:17:54.577
Where is Jake?

01:17:59.048 --> 01:18:00.216
Where is Alexander?

01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:03.751
- I need your help.
- You must think I'm some kind of muppet.

01:18:03.753 --> 01:18:05.186
Do you think I'm gonna
rat out my partner...

01:18:05.188 --> 01:18:06.789
I'm not asking you
to rat him out.

01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:10.057
What I'm asking you to do
is to follow orders.

01:18:10.059 --> 01:18:12.625
I'm asking you to give me
the information I need...

01:18:12.627 --> 01:18:13.796
My loyalty's to him.

01:18:16.199 --> 01:18:17.931
- I'm not asking...
- I will not rat out my partner.

01:18:17.933 --> 01:18:19.235
I am your superior officer.

01:18:21.804 --> 01:18:24.572
It's happy hour, Jess.
It looks like you need a beer.

01:19:05.814 --> 01:19:07.782
Three minutes.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.215
Two minutes.

01:19:41.715 --> 01:19:44.085
You don't know shit!
Can I go now?

01:19:45.085 --> 01:19:47.154
Tell me the truth.

01:19:48.856 --> 01:19:50.925
I joined Jake's team
because of my father,

01:19:51.426 --> 01:19:52.926
which makes him family.

01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:57.197
And family always comes first.

01:20:00.434 --> 01:20:02.870
You are obstructing justice.

01:20:04.472 --> 01:20:06.807
Go ahead. Sit there.

01:20:07.274 --> 01:20:08.275
Say nothing.

01:20:09.343 --> 01:20:10.344
I'll wait.

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.848
One minute.

01:20:49.015 --> 01:20:49.983
Thirty seconds.

01:20:54.086 --> 01:20:55.422
Fifteen seconds.

01:21:04.063 --> 01:21:05.332
Target locked, sir.

01:21:16.075 --> 01:21:17.043
Missile released.

01:21:20.513 --> 01:21:22.181
Welcome home, my love.

01:21:38.397 --> 01:21:39.465
I don't know.

01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:41.100
Rosen.

01:21:42.168 --> 01:21:44.169
And my guess is nobody does.

01:21:45.571 --> 01:21:47.305
I've already made my decision.

01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:52.911
I've got a plane to catch.

01:22:00.151 --> 01:22:01.086
Rosen.

01:22:08.472 --> 01:22:13.472
