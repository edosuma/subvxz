I DIDN'T HAVE
A VERY GOOD TIME.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.214
OH, OF COURSE YOU DID.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.018
NO, I DIDN'T.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.286
NOW, TAKE DINNER,
FOR INSTANCE.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.523
NOT ONLY DID YOU INSIST
ON ORDERING IT FOR ME,

14:16.589 --> 14:19.826
BUT THEN YOU CUT MY STEAK UP
IN LITTLE TINY PIECES,

14:19.893 --> 14:22.462
AND YOU TRIED TO FEED ME.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.397
I'M SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T BURP ME.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.170
IS THAT
AN INVITATION, BABY?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.718
STEVE, YOU CAN GO NOW.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.387
I'M HOME SAFE.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.556
PERHAPS I SHOULD ESCORT
YOU UP TO YOUR ROOM.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.993
AFTER ALL, MOST ACCIDENTS
DO OCCUR IN THE HOME.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.561
IF YOU DON'T LEAVE
RIGHT NOW,

14:54.627 --> 14:58.731
THERE'S GOING TO BE A REALLY
BIG ACCIDENT RIGHT HERE.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.167
I SEE, WELL...

15:00.233 --> 15:03.003
I CANNOT BID YOU
ADIEU JUST YET, MY PET,

15:03.070 --> 15:06.506
NOT UNTIL YOU FEAST YOUR
FABULOUS EYES ON--UHH!

15:14.747 --> 15:16.149
ON THIS.

15:18.885 --> 15:19.919
A PRESENT?

15:19.987 --> 15:21.989
A BAUBLE FOR
A BODACIOUS BABE.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.026
AN I.D. BRACELET?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.429
"TO LAURA."

15:29.496 --> 15:31.498
"ALL MY GLOVE?"

15:31.564 --> 15:34.234
"SLEEVE?"

15:34.301 --> 15:35.568
I BOUGHT IT
FROM WALDO.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.705
IT'S A MIRACLE THE SPELLING
IS AS GOOD AS IT IS.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.311
WELL, THANK YOU, STEVE,
BUT I CAN'T KEEP THIS.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.880
OH, WHY NOT, PUDDIN' POP?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.416
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
GOING STEADY.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.550
BUT WE SHOULD.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.819
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS
PROGRESSING NICELY.

15:52.885 --> 15:56.056
REMEMBER, JUST LAST WEEK,
YOU BLEW ME A KISS.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.494
STEVE, I WAS
SPITTING OUT MY GUM.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.465
OH.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.869
COME HERE, STEVE.
COME HERE.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.005
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS MY FAULT.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.341
WHEN WE FIRST MET, I USED
TO TELL YOU EVERY DAY

16:14.407 --> 16:16.676
THAT THERE WOULD NEVER BE
ANYTHING BETWEEN US,

16:16.743 --> 16:19.546
BUT LATELY,
I'VE GOTTEN LAZY.

16:21.614 --> 16:25.285
YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A MONTH SINCE
I TOLD YOU TO STOP BUGGING ME.

16:25.352 --> 16:29.189
FROM NOW ON, I WILL TELL
YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY

16:29.256 --> 16:31.958
THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
WILL NEVER...

16:32.025 --> 16:34.327
EVER...EVER GO ANYWHERE.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.897
OKAY.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.467
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST WEAR THE BRACELET?

16:44.471 --> 16:45.605
GO HOME!

16:52.579 --> 16:53.846
WELL...

16:53.913 --> 16:55.382
I'M TEMPTED TO LEAVE.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.325
YOU KNOW, THAT DRESS
LOOKS STUNNING.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.795
IT MAKES ME THINK...

17:08.861 --> 17:10.097
THOUGHTS.

17:11.764 --> 17:12.965
UH...

17:13.032 --> 17:17.304
LIEUTENANT, YOU KNOW,
I'VE TRIED TO BE NICE,

17:17.370 --> 17:19.072
I'VE TRIED
TO BE TACTFUL,

17:19.139 --> 17:21.574
BUT NOW IT APPEARS I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO BE BLUNT.

17:24.677 --> 17:25.745
YOU REPULSE ME.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.318
SO YOU WANT TO SLOW DANCE
AND NECK A LITTLE?

17:34.121 --> 17:35.355
GO HOME!

17:47.634 --> 17:49.102
THEY TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE LEAVIN'.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.305
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S TRUE.

17:54.374 --> 17:58.010
'CAUSE, GIRL,
THERE'S JUST NO LIVIN'

17:58.077 --> 17:59.612
WITHOUT YOU.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.418
* DON'T TAKE YOUR LOVE *

18:07.920 --> 18:09.522
* AWAY FROM ME *

18:11.258 --> 18:14.794
* DON'T YOU LEAVE MY HEART
IN MISERY *

18:17.830 --> 18:20.133
* 'CAUSE IF YOU DO *

18:20.200 --> 18:23.636
* THEN I'LL BE BLUE *

18:23.703 --> 18:27.674
* 'CAUSE BREAKIN' UP
IS HARD TO DO *

18:28.741 --> 18:30.443
* THEY SAY
THAT BREAKIN' UP *

18:32.245 --> 18:33.846
* IS *

18:33.913 --> 18:35.515
* HARD TO DO *

18:37.950 --> 18:40.220
* NOW I KNOW *

18:40.287 --> 18:43.656
* I KNOW THAT
IT'S TRUE *

18:43.723 --> 18:48.628
* DON'T SAY THAT
THIS IS THE END *

18:50.163 --> 18:52.332
* INSTEAD OF BREAKIN' UP *

18:52.399 --> 18:55.768
* I WISH THAT
WE WERE MAKIN' UP AGAIN *

18:57.837 --> 19:01.140
* I BEG OF YOU *

19:04.344 --> 19:06.246
* DON'T SAY GOODBYE *

19:07.947 --> 19:12.385
* CAN'T WE GIVE OUR LOVE
JUST ONE MORE TRY *

19:14.521 --> 19:18.691
* COME ON, BABY,
LET'S START ANEW *

19:20.327 --> 19:25.498
* 'CAUSE BREAKIN' UP
IS HARD TO DO **

19:38.144 --> 19:40.313
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.482
WELL, NEITHER DO YOU.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.183
THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING HERE?

19:44.251 --> 19:45.652
WELL, CERTAINLY
NOT HARMONY.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.522
I NEED A DRINK.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.525
ME, TOO, AND I KNOW
JUST THE PLACE.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.899
AHH!
AHH!

20:02.235 --> 20:04.904
ANOTHER ROUND, LIEU?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.239
SET 'EM UP, KID.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.611
HERE I AM AGAIN,

20:11.678 --> 20:15.282
DROWNING MY SORROWS
IN ROOT BEER FLOATS.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.417
YEAH, WELL, MY SORROWS
DON'T DROWN,

20:17.484 --> 20:20.453
THEY JUST...DOG-PADDLE
AROUND IN MY HEART.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.292
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, KID.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.126
WOMEN MYSTIFY ME.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.628
YEAH. WHEN GOD
CREATED WOMEN,

20:28.695 --> 20:32.765
HE SHOULD HAVE SUPPLIED
A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.568
I REALLY TRIED TO IMPRESS RACHEL
TONIGHT, BUT SHE THREW

20:35.635 --> 20:38.505
A HISSY FIT JUST BECAUSE
I ORDERED FOR HER.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.173
I ALWAYS THOUGHT WOMEN GO
FOR A TAKE CHARGE

20:41.240 --> 20:43.510
TELL 'EM WHAT THEY WANT
KINDA GUY.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.945
YEAH, WELL, I'M MORE
OF A PUT 'EM ON A PEDESTAL

20:46.012 --> 20:48.481
YOU'RE LUCKY IF THEY SPEAK
TO YOU KINDA GUY.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.887
WELL, MY APPROACH
DOESN'T WORK.

20:54.954 --> 20:58.190
AND YOURS IS PATHETIC.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.894
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
GIVE UP WOMEN.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.830
NO, LIEU.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.999
NO MATTER HOW
FRUSTRATING THEY ARE,

21:07.066 --> 21:08.535
WE NEED THEM.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.537
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, KID.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.805
WE NEED WOMEN
TO CRANK OUT MORE MEN.

21:18.911 --> 21:23.049
GEE, LIEU, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY
RACHEL DIDN'T FLIP FOR YOU.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.588
GO FIGURE.

21:28.655 --> 21:32.325
YOU KNOW, LIEU-EY,
I'VE LOVED LAURA WINSLOW

21:32.392 --> 21:35.595
EVER SINCE I FIRST
LAID EYES ON HER.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.898
SO FAR, SHE HASN'T
RETURNED MY LOVE,

21:38.965 --> 21:43.202
BUT THE HOPE OF WINNING HER
IS WHAT KEEPS ME GOING.

21:43.269 --> 21:46.506
THAT HOPE IS ENOUGH
TO GET ME OUT OF BED

21:46.573 --> 21:49.609
EVERY MORNING INTO
MY SCOOBY-DOO SLIPPERS.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.482
I HEAR YOU, KID.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.850
I'VE ONLY HAD ONE DATE
WITH RACHEL,

21:57.917 --> 22:00.853
BUT THAT GIRL'S REALLY
GOTTEN TO ME.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.822
SHE'S COPPED
THIS COP'S HEART.

22:13.065 --> 22:16.035
SO WE CAN'T
GIVE UP, LIEU.

22:16.102 --> 22:20.106
WE MUST PURSUE
OUR LADY LOVES.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.209
YOU'RE RIGHT, KID.
A TOAST.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.577
TO THE WOMEN WE LOVE.

22:24.644 --> 22:28.114
AND TO THE DAY WHEN THEY CAN
STAND THE SIGHT OF US.
