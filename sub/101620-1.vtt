00:02.534 --> 00:04.992
(movie reel clicking)

00:04.992 --> 00:08.159
(soft dramatic music)

00:42.760 --> 00:45.800
- The Valley, as it is today.

00:47.470 --> 00:51.200
Look at it, the air still
stinks of corruption.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.940
The aftermath of nearly
seven decades of greed.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.520
The capitalists controlled
every aspect of this steel town.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.770
Laying waste to anything good in its path.

01:20.295 --> 01:21.904
(dog barking)

01:21.904 --> 01:26.160
I was born into it, product
of my environment they say.

01:29.980 --> 01:34.020
I knew better, but it
still swallowed me whole.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.880
My family was big in
these parts back then.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.380
Especially where yours is from.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.870
This is what built and
destroyed this town.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.080
Time changes everything.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.400
In order to move forward,
you gotta go back.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.050
See all those mountains that you climbed,

02:07.050 --> 02:11.500
only then can you truly
appreciate the destination.

03:05.038 --> 03:06.020
- [Charlie] Your mom's
not gonna be too happy

03:06.020 --> 03:07.870
when she finds out, you know.

03:07.870 --> 03:10.560
- He started it, he
stole my baseball glove.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.540
- Son, violence is the last resort.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.400
You gotta learn to keep your cool

03:15.400 --> 03:16.970
till it's time not too.

03:16.970 --> 03:18.200
- [Man In Suit] Shut up, shut up!

03:18.200 --> 03:20.160
Your mother's talking to you, shut up!

03:20.160 --> 03:20.993
- [Lady] It wasn't his fault.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.830
- [Man In Suit] What the hell
is the matter with you, huh?

03:22.830 --> 03:23.779
- [Lady] It wasn't his fault.

03:23.779 --> 03:25.880
- Shut up!
- He called you a coward

03:25.880 --> 03:26.880
for trying to leave the family.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.380
- [Charlie] Don't you fight my
battles for me, you hear me?

03:29.380 --> 03:30.213
- Yes sir.

03:32.370 --> 03:34.920
- Besides, it was coming
from his drunk of a father.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.108
- Shut up

03:36.108 --> 03:36.941
- It wasn't his fault.

03:36.941 --> 03:37.940
- [Dad] What you wanna, you wanna mess

03:37.940 --> 03:38.773
with your old man now?

03:38.773 --> 03:39.760
Is that the best you got?

03:39.760 --> 03:40.694
- [Lady] No, don't Billy.

03:40.694 --> 03:41.707
(man grunting)
(body thudding)

03:41.707 --> 03:42.540
- You stay here, you hear me.

03:42.540 --> 03:43.500
- Stop, stop.
- Huh?

03:43.500 --> 03:45.791
- [Man] I said shut up, I'm sick of this!

03:45.791 --> 03:46.727
(skin smacking)
(lady groaning)

03:46.727 --> 03:48.625
(lady whimpering)

03:48.625 --> 03:52.090
Well, isn't it the yellow
belly Enzo to the rescue.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.395
(skin smacking)

03:56.395 --> 03:57.794
(body thudding)

03:57.794 --> 04:00.160
(man laughing)

04:00.160 --> 04:03.190
- Jimbo's not gonna like you
messing around in our affairs.

04:03.190 --> 04:04.860
- You two get in the
car, I'll take you home

04:04.860 --> 04:05.810
after he sobers up.

04:07.790 --> 04:11.280
- Hey, Tommy Gun Soreno,
I'm talking to you.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.329
- [Charlie] I'll tell you what Michael,

04:17.329 --> 04:19.760
I'm gonna give your dumb
Cleveland ass a pass on this one

04:19.760 --> 04:21.940
because you can't help yourself.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.988
But if I hear about any more
bruises on Jeff over there,

04:24.988 --> 04:27.620
or if I hear about any more on your wife,

04:27.620 --> 04:30.050
your gonna need more than Jimbo's help.

04:30.050 --> 04:32.330
'Cause I'm gonna break every
fucking bone in your body,

04:32.330 --> 04:33.670
one by fucking one!

04:36.180 --> 04:39.210
- Yeah, well all your ghost
stories don't scare me.

04:47.819 --> 04:49.820
- Sorry that had to happen to your boy

04:49.820 --> 04:50.970
and you too Mrs. Torin.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.470
- (sobbing) He's getting worse.

04:54.470 --> 04:55.950
- You two can stay with us on the farm

04:55.950 --> 04:57.536
as long as you'd like.

04:57.536 --> 04:59.210
- Thank you Charlie.

05:00.390 --> 05:01.450
- You're welcome ma'am.

05:02.610 --> 05:04.760
Son, apologize to Jeff.

05:04.760 --> 05:05.593
- But--

05:05.593 --> 05:06.910
- No buts.

05:06.910 --> 05:09.980
- Fine, I'm sorry Jeffery.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.560
- I'm sorry too Lou,
for stealing your glove

05:12.560 --> 05:13.710
and you too Mr. Soreno.

05:14.943 --> 05:15.776
- That's okay.

05:16.654 --> 05:18.600
You see, friends again.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.540
(dramatic music)

05:31.540 --> 05:35.240
- You're gonna get yours
Tommy Soreno, soon.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.560
(explosion booming)

06:03.275 --> 06:05.942
(phone ringing)

06:13.686 --> 06:14.519
- Hello?

06:16.239 --> 06:18.080
Yeah, hold on a second.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.190
Honey, it's Jimmy.

06:23.610 --> 06:24.443
Hold on.

06:32.228 --> 06:33.211
When are you gonna quit smoking

06:33.211 --> 06:35.290
those disgusting things?

06:37.410 --> 06:39.450
- Maybe when you start putting out again.

07:08.040 --> 07:08.873
Yeah, Jim.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.063
He did what?

07:18.960 --> 07:21.210
You tell him to meet me
out at the rock mine.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.960
Have Tim and Johnny pick me up.

07:27.707 --> 07:30.374
(phone dinging)

07:37.344 --> 07:40.177
(thunder booming)

07:42.460 --> 07:43.920
- [Reporter] Breaking news,

07:43.920 --> 07:45.220
terror strikes at the heart of yet

07:45.220 --> 07:47.640
another Youngstown family.
- Oh shit. (laughs)

07:47.640 --> 07:48.570
- [Reporter] Bringing the total

07:48.570 --> 07:50.710
to 23 victims this past year.

07:50.710 --> 07:52.470
For the second time this week,

07:52.470 --> 07:54.820
this has been showed by a car bomb.

07:54.820 --> 07:57.260
This time taking the lives of two,

07:57.260 --> 08:00.900
a father and son, and severely
injuring his second boy.

08:00.900 --> 08:03.510
Police are scouring the
streets to find the suspect.

08:03.510 --> 08:07.290
But little hope is given
to find the mad bomber.

08:08.293 --> 08:10.084
- These freaking lops. (laughs)

08:10.084 --> 08:12.834
(engine roaring)

08:22.804 --> 08:25.740
(laughs) Boom, did you see that?

08:25.740 --> 08:28.060
Of course you did, everyone did.

08:28.060 --> 08:30.510
They left a crater. (laughs)

08:30.510 --> 08:32.230
Man, I wish I could've found that Tommy,

08:32.230 --> 08:33.063
but oh well.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.250
Mr. Mancini, you have to be pleased.

08:38.179 --> 08:40.690
- Pleased, yeah pleased.

08:43.270 --> 08:45.020
Well I am not fucking pleased!

08:46.230 --> 08:50.800
I said just Charlie, huh, what did you to?

08:50.800 --> 08:52.159
What did you do?

08:52.159 --> 08:54.159
Blow up his two kids while you're at it.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.073
Get him up.

09:02.290 --> 09:06.028
Sick fuck!
(man groaning)

09:06.028 --> 09:08.760
- But Mr. Mancini, I did what you asked.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.240
- [Mr. Mancini] I did
not ask for this okay,

09:11.240 --> 09:12.770
you know the fucking rules.

09:12.770 --> 09:13.930
- But you owe me.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.790
- I owe you, (chuckles) owe you.

09:19.875 --> 09:22.175
Hey, who the fuck's this
guy think he is, huh?

09:23.640 --> 09:25.190
You know who I fucking owe now?

09:26.030 --> 09:28.150
Charlie's family, for life.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.060
I not only took out that woman's husband,

09:32.060 --> 09:33.210
but her eldest son too.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.080
God only knows if the
youngest one will survive.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.280
That's who I fucking
owe, you piece of shit.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.670
- [Killer] Mr. Mancini.

09:44.710 --> 09:49.710
- Jim, get rid of pyromaniac child killer.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.780
I got no more use for him.

09:53.820 --> 09:57.730
You send him to hell, burn
him, where he belongs.

09:58.660 --> 09:59.510
- [Jim] Yes boss.

10:04.718 --> 10:07.218
(gun banging)

10:08.770 --> 10:09.603
- Funny thing.

10:09.603 --> 10:10.591
- [Mobster] Jim, get me
the gas can and the flares.

10:10.591 --> 10:12.370
- After that night, someone pulled my mom

10:12.370 --> 10:13.620
into a side room as the hospital

10:13.620 --> 10:14.914
and told her that all my medical bills

10:14.914 --> 10:17.120
had been paid for by an anonymous donor.

10:18.260 --> 10:20.810
By the time we got home,
the garage was fixed,

10:20.810 --> 10:22.890
along with the side of the house.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.556
Plus, a few weeks later,
she received a contribution

10:26.556 --> 10:29.170
from the neighborhood, just
to get us back on our feet.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.320
Never did find out who
was behind all that,

10:33.320 --> 10:35.450
but it was a nice homecoming,

10:35.450 --> 10:37.900
taking into consideration
what we'd been through.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.400
By the time I was healthy,

10:42.003 --> 10:43.820
good old Vito took me under his wing.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.047
So it began my journey into the abyss.

14:58.140 --> 14:59.840
As fate would have it, I wound up

14:59.840 --> 15:01.290
back under the steel curtain.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.510
- You shoulda seen that guy,

15:04.510 --> 15:06.600
all dressed in his new
JCPenney catalog suit.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.430
- Louis] There's my pal, Jeffery Torin.

15:08.430 --> 15:11.070
- He laid down all his money
on the table and guess what?

15:11.070 --> 15:12.380
- [Both] Flop!

15:12.380 --> 15:15.050
- [Louis] Ah Jeff, my
fest friend and partner.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.420
After my father and brother were killed,

15:18.420 --> 15:20.110
his mom and brothers
used to stop by the house

15:20.110 --> 15:22.389
and bring us dinner now and then.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.370
And my mom really appreciated that.

15:24.370 --> 15:25.790
His dad, of course, never came around,

15:25.790 --> 15:27.190
which wasn't too big a loss.

15:28.164 --> 15:30.700
And we used to play in
the backyard for hours.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.320
Running around and
getting into adventures.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.300
Jeff really helped me get through

15:34.300 --> 15:35.630
some tough times in my life

15:35.630 --> 15:37.730
and he's been there for me more than once.

15:38.690 --> 15:39.980
- The dice were fucking loaded.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.960
- [Louis] Of course they were.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.020
I bet that made Mancini happy.

15:43.020 --> 15:45.420
- It did, tell the scumbag tried to grab

15:45.420 --> 15:47.280
all his lost money and
get the fuck outta there.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.844
- Aw.

15:48.844 --> 15:49.950
- You do that back in
the day at Jungle Inn,

15:49.950 --> 15:51.809
they'll be feeding you to fucking Wilbur.

15:51.809 --> 15:54.226
(man laughs)

16:01.570 --> 16:04.296
- Bet that new Penney suit'll
need some dry cleaning.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.782
- That and he won't be
able to play the clarinet

16:06.782 --> 16:10.030
very well for a while. (chuckles)

16:13.253 --> 16:17.000
- You see, in this town,
didn't matter who you were.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.880
You obey capo law to the letter or else.

16:23.000 --> 16:23.833
- [Jeffery] Oh.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.170
- Whoa, hey Jeff, Lou.

16:27.131 --> 16:28.762
You guys scared me.

16:28.762 --> 16:30.280
What can I do for you fellas?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.820
- [Jeff] Mancini wants to see you.

16:33.060 --> 16:33.893
Come on.

16:42.207 --> 16:43.830
- It wasn't unusual for
us to entertain people

16:43.830 --> 16:44.930
who opposed capo law.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.400
But tonight, it felt a little different.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.879
You caught on quick to
keep your mouth shut

16:50.879 --> 16:52.740
or you wound up with lead poisoning.

16:55.930 --> 16:58.590
- So Mr. Mancini, what can I do you for?

16:58.590 --> 17:01.250
- I think we're having some
trouble with our communication.

17:02.753 --> 17:05.540
- What, what, what do you mean?

17:05.540 --> 17:08.250
- You took it upon yourself
to violate our agreements.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.250
- [Bill] Agreements, no.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.083
- No, sir.

17:12.460 --> 17:13.839
- [Bill] Yes, sorry.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.560
Sorry, no sir.

17:21.349 --> 17:23.530
- Well then why did you try

17:23.530 --> 17:25.619
and shoot the fleeing DeFrange here?

17:27.099 --> 17:28.240
When he pulled that botched

17:28.240 --> 17:29.890
jewelry store robbery a week ago.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.850
- You said because of that thing.

17:36.940 --> 17:37.840
The Chicago thing.

17:38.850 --> 17:39.683
- Chicago?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.120
Did something happen in Chicago?

17:47.650 --> 17:49.670
I pay you to protect my interests.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.200
When I give a man a job,

17:53.200 --> 17:56.150
that means I'm instilling in
them a certain level of trust.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
So am I trusting the wrong person, Bill?

18:00.950 --> 18:02.111
- No.

18:02.111 --> 18:03.620
- Because I thought you could
handle a simple little job

18:03.620 --> 18:04.850
to protect my interests.

18:06.037 --> 18:07.820
If I can't trust you to protect it,

18:09.920 --> 18:11.790
how can you trust me to protect you?

18:13.401 --> 18:16.710
- Yes, yes I understand,
I understand completely.

18:16.710 --> 18:18.130
You can trust me, please
give me another chance,

18:18.130 --> 18:18.963
Mr. Mancini.
- Yeah I know, Bill.

18:18.963 --> 18:20.690
I know, Bill, people make mistakes.

18:21.530 --> 18:26.040
The secret is to learn from them

18:26.040 --> 18:27.840
so we don't repeat those mistakes.

18:30.070 --> 18:31.690
Yeah, I'll give you a second chance.

18:33.050 --> 18:36.340
But you will have to apologize.

18:36.340 --> 18:39.340
- Yes, I'm sorry, I'm
very sorry Mr. Mancini.

18:39.340 --> 18:40.810
It will never happen again.

18:41.770 --> 18:44.730
- There we go, all settled.

18:45.630 --> 18:48.880
You just go on back to business as usual.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.860
Don't worry about Mr. DeFrange here.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.670
Oh cheer up, Johnny boy.

18:56.670 --> 18:57.970
He said he was sorry.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.360
Take him back to work boys.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.410
- [Mobster] Let's go.

19:03.460 --> 19:04.960
- [Mr. Mancini] You too, Johnny.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.010
I'm through with you.

19:07.740 --> 19:08.910
Oh hey, Louie.

19:08.910 --> 19:09.743
- [Louie] Yeah, boss.

19:10.750 --> 19:15.130
- Could you give this to your
mom when you get a chance?

19:15.996 --> 19:16.829
- Yeah.

19:17.691 --> 19:20.050
- I didn't want to forget her anniversary.

19:20.050 --> 19:23.450
That's a little something
special from Dianne and I.

19:23.450 --> 19:24.810
- [Louis] Thank you Mr. Mancini.

19:24.810 --> 19:27.740
(upbeat jazzy music)

19:27.740 --> 19:29.390
- Now get the fuck outta here, huh.

19:29.390 --> 19:32.350
Wait over there for us.

19:35.070 --> 19:38.240
- Mancini always had this
clever charm about him.

19:38.240 --> 19:43.240
That brought out the best
and the worst in people.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.620
- Jeffery, you coming to
Dianne's party tomorrow?

19:45.620 --> 19:47.020
- Of course I'm coming boss.

19:48.550 --> 19:51.163
- All right, I'll talk to you then.

19:51.163 --> 19:54.240
- Okay, thank you.

19:55.670 --> 19:57.150
Hey Lou, you wanna get some eat in

19:57.150 --> 19:58.890
after we drop his ass off?

19:58.890 --> 20:00.400
- Definitely.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.570
- [Agent] Look at that prick,
smiling at the cameras.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.100
- Yeah, keep waving asshole.

20:05.990 --> 20:09.420
It's only a matter of time.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.630
- [Louis] Everyone knew
to keep their mouths shut

20:10.630 --> 20:13.500
about business when the
flower truck was around.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.490
I still don't know why
they weren't less obvious.

20:16.490 --> 20:18.990
Hey, so what's he wanna
see you 'bout tomorrow?

20:20.040 --> 20:21.660
- Probably business at
the club or something.

20:21.660 --> 20:22.493
Said something 'bout bringing

20:22.493 --> 20:24.280
some dancing girls in from Kansas.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.026
You know Diane fancy the erotic, huh.

20:26.026 --> 20:26.859
(men laughing)

20:26.859 --> 20:28.030
- Yeah, that's for sure.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.800
- Hey ma'am, could you top her off please?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.460
- Sure, yeah one sec.

20:32.460 --> 20:34.080
- Thank you.

20:34.080 --> 20:34.913
She's beautiful.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.900
It doesn't matter anyway, 'cause Maggie

20:38.900 --> 20:41.081
wanted to go to Diane's
after to celebrate.

20:41.081 --> 20:44.240
Said she wanted some new
expensive China set or some shit.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.842
You know how women are.

20:45.842 --> 20:47.120
- [Louis] Yeah.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.250
- Speaking of Maggie, I
actually gotta give her a call.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.289
Thank you.

20:51.289 --> 20:54.390
- Sure no problem, how
'bout you, want some?

20:54.390 --> 20:55.350
- Uh.
- Have another cup.

20:55.350 --> 20:58.055
I gotta call her, you know
how she freaks out right?

20:58.055 --> 20:59.076
- Yeah.

20:59.076 --> 20:59.926
- I'll take that.

21:00.780 --> 21:01.670
- Thank you.

21:01.670 --> 21:05.420
- Yeah, so what are
you guys up to tonight?

21:05.420 --> 21:06.770
- Ah, not much.

21:06.770 --> 21:08.220
You know we just had to go
pick a couple of things up

21:08.220 --> 21:10.100
and drop 'em off.

21:10.100 --> 21:13.125
- So you're just like
errand boys? (laughs)

21:13.125 --> 21:15.540
- No, I wouldn't say that's all we are.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.770
- Well, you're getting more
interesting by the minute.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.352
- Hey, what about you?

21:20.352 --> 21:21.560
I haven't seen you in here before.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.470
Normally it's good old
chain-smoking Doris.

21:23.470 --> 21:25.610
- Well, come back more
often and you'll find out.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.190
Excuse me, sir.
- Excuse me.

21:30.090 --> 21:31.060
Oh sorry sir.

21:31.060 --> 21:32.060
- Fuck your sorries.

21:33.060 --> 21:33.893
- What?

21:37.060 --> 21:37.893
- Hey Jeff.

21:43.831 --> 21:45.430
- Can you believe this fucking guy?

21:45.430 --> 21:46.263
- Fuck him.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.830
- Can I get some service
around here or what?

21:50.830 --> 21:52.140
- [Waitress] One second, so sorry.

21:52.140 --> 21:53.640
- [Customer] And a coffee?

21:53.640 --> 21:54.473
- Yeah, sure.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.156
Sorry, it's just really
late and we're short-handed.

21:57.156 --> 22:00.213
- Yeah, come on with this.
- What's wrong with this guy?

22:00.213 --> 22:02.930
- Good job.
- Yeah, for sure.

22:05.810 --> 22:08.180
- Hey, could you do your damn job

22:08.180 --> 22:10.090
and get me a creamer that's not curdled?

22:11.310 --> 22:13.210
- I'm so sorry, I'll be right back.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.420
- You ready to go?

22:25.520 --> 22:27.430
- What the fuck do you want?

22:27.430 --> 22:29.290
- Just paying my bill.

22:29.290 --> 22:30.927
- Well you can go stand
somewhere else queer bait.

22:30.927 --> 22:31.760
(Louis gasping)

22:31.760 --> 22:32.788
- Queer, how?

22:32.788 --> 22:34.225
(men groaning)
(glass breaking)

22:34.225 --> 22:35.683
(upbeat music)

22:35.683 --> 22:38.410
Come on lil fuck, huh,
who's the queer bait now?

22:38.410 --> 22:41.150
Get up, what you gonna do now, huh?

22:41.150 --> 22:43.103
- Yeah, what now bitch.

22:43.103 --> 22:45.690
- You motherfucker, who's
the fucking queer, huh?

22:45.690 --> 22:49.370
Apologize Super Mario,
apologize, let's go.

22:49.370 --> 22:50.940
Come on Lou, let's go.

22:50.940 --> 22:51.980
Come with me, baby.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.520
- Whoa, what the hell happened out here?

22:59.520 --> 23:01.160
- Nothing, just paying my bill ma'am.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.230
Oh, I mean Wendy.

23:03.230 --> 23:04.554
- Well the owner actually said your bills

23:04.554 --> 23:06.360
are on the arm.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.490
- Well yeah, but that doesn't mean

23:07.490 --> 23:09.078
I can't tip for good service.

23:09.078 --> 23:10.210
- [Waitress] Good service?

23:10.210 --> 23:11.670
- Yeah, I mean none has been better.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.216
Oh and hey, the gentleman
that was sitting here.

23:15.216 --> 23:16.049
- [Waitress] Yeah.

23:16.049 --> 23:16.910
- He had to beat it.

23:16.910 --> 23:19.920
He accidentally spilled
his coffee on his way out.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.680
I don't know what his problem is.

23:21.680 --> 23:22.660
- Really.

23:22.660 --> 23:25.410
- Yeah, oh and actually left
you this for your trouble.

23:26.650 --> 23:27.770
- [Waitress] I don't believe you.

23:27.770 --> 23:29.600
- Hey, Scout's honor.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.179
- Yeah, you're no Boy Scout.

23:31.179 --> 23:33.650
- (laughs) Oh yeah, you caught me there.

23:33.650 --> 23:34.950
Hey, but the rest is true.

23:36.910 --> 23:40.280
And you know what, let me
help you pick up the mess.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.730
- So you can stare at my ass?

23:43.220 --> 23:44.680
- Why else?

23:44.680 --> 23:45.950
- Let me go get a mop.

23:45.950 --> 23:47.303
- [Jeff] You hear me?

23:47.303 --> 23:49.970
(men screaming)

23:55.066 --> 23:57.150
- I have all the big glass pieces.

23:57.150 --> 23:58.830
- Well thank you, I'm sorry, your name.

23:58.830 --> 24:01.010
- [Lou] Louis, you can call me Lou.

24:02.350 --> 24:05.010
- Well I guess you can run
off with your friend, Lou.

24:05.010 --> 24:08.180
I got the rest, but thank you, really.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.013
- [Lou] Sure.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.610
- Hey, why don't you come back

24:13.610 --> 24:15.990
and we can talk some more.

24:15.990 --> 24:18.011
- To you, I'll be back every night.

24:18.011 --> 24:20.844
(Wendy chuckling)

24:22.584 --> 24:23.501
- Oh great.

24:24.986 --> 24:26.204
(man screaming)

24:26.204 --> 24:27.560
- Why, you're not such a
fucking tough guy now, huh?

24:27.560 --> 24:28.393
- [Customer] Please.

24:28.393 --> 24:29.980
- It's not right to pick on a woman.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.880
I ever see you in that fucking
diner again, I'll kill you!

24:31.880 --> 24:33.180
I like that fucking diner!

24:34.250 --> 24:35.200
I ain't the bad guy!

24:35.200 --> 24:36.310
What took you so long?

24:37.469 --> 24:39.430
- What are we gonna do
with the fucking trash?

24:39.430 --> 24:40.780
- I don't know man, he
look like he can't even

24:40.780 --> 24:43.680
take a beating like a
fucking man, fucking pussy!

24:43.680 --> 24:44.847
Tough guy!

24:44.847 --> 24:48.440
I say we drop his ass over an overpass.

24:48.440 --> 24:52.390
Huh, overpass, ass, fucking rhymes.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.370
- You're fucking crazy bro.
- Shit.

24:55.370 --> 24:56.380
- Let's just take him to the station

24:56.380 --> 24:57.950
and let Bill handle it.

24:57.950 --> 25:00.880
- What, when did you become
such a softy, Lou, fuck?

25:01.954 --> 25:03.320
- [Customer] Help,
please, I'll do anything.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.490
- Shut up, bitch!
- One thing you learn

25:04.490 --> 25:07.870
being in Mancini's crew, always
treat women with respect.

25:08.782 --> 25:10.332
Jeff really took that to heart.

25:11.497 --> 25:14.164
(man screaming)

25:16.264 --> 25:18.784
Now Jeff was determined to be
different than his old man.

25:18.784 --> 25:21.790
Though, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree sometimes,

25:22.740 --> 25:24.340
as he was never home for Maggie.

25:42.648 --> 25:44.893
(Jeff snoring)

25:44.893 --> 25:46.924
(glass breaking)

25:46.924 --> 25:48.406
- [Maggie] Where the fuck
have you been Jeffery?

25:48.406 --> 25:49.490
(Jeffery coughing)

25:49.490 --> 25:51.210
- [Jeffery] Jesus Christ.

25:51.210 --> 25:52.060
- [Maggie] Where?

25:53.405 --> 25:56.020
- Jesus, I'm home aren't I?

25:56.020 --> 25:57.260
- [Maggie] Where, what, were you out

25:57.260 --> 25:59.140
fucking one of your whores?

25:59.140 --> 26:01.210
- No, no I wasn't!

26:02.170 --> 26:04.570
- [Maggie] You knew I had a
special night planned for us.

26:04.570 --> 26:06.360
I spent all day cooking.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.550
- Cooking?

26:07.550 --> 26:08.383
- [Maggie] Yeah, you piece of shit.

26:08.383 --> 26:10.825
- Babe, I'm sorry.

26:10.825 --> 26:14.269
- Babe, don't you babe me,
Jeff, don't you babe me.

26:14.269 --> 26:15.102
(glass breaking)

26:15.102 --> 26:17.730
- Oh my god, you psycho!

26:17.730 --> 26:19.720
Babe, I'm sorry.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.342
Don't you fucking throw
that at me, don't you dare.

26:22.342 --> 26:23.175
- I'm pissed.

26:23.175 --> 26:24.008
- [Jeff] No, don't.

26:24.008 --> 26:24.841
(body thudding)

26:24.841 --> 26:25.674
Aw, goddammit!

26:25.674 --> 26:27.140
Maggie, I had to work.

26:27.140 --> 26:28.740
- You always have to work.

26:28.740 --> 26:31.940
You're always putting the
family's needs before ours.

26:31.940 --> 26:34.321
- I'll put our needs first,
is that what you want?

26:34.321 --> 26:38.321
- Yeah, good.

26:38.321 --> 26:39.154
- Just calm down.

26:39.154 --> 26:41.750
Oh my God, dammit Maggie!

26:42.590 --> 26:44.610
Vito had me doing things for
him, I couldn't get away.

26:44.610 --> 26:46.180
- I don't care, you promised!

26:47.540 --> 26:49.150
- [Jeff] I love you, babe, you...

26:50.974 --> 26:52.391
Dammit, yes I do.

26:53.856 --> 26:55.273
Maggie, yes I do.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.570
- If you did, you would've
been home. (sobbing)

27:00.570 --> 27:04.560
Tonight was special Jeffery,
it was our anniversary.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.900
- Babe, what are you talking about?

27:06.900 --> 27:09.340
We got married on New Year's
six year ago, and it's July.

27:10.282 --> 27:12.660
- Not our wedding anniversary you dipshit.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.260
Our engagement anniversary.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.710
- Come on Maggie, are you serious?

27:16.710 --> 27:19.955
Who the fuck remembers engagement
anniversaries honestly?

27:19.955 --> 27:23.210
- Well that's just it Jeffery,
you don't remember anything.

27:23.210 --> 27:25.840
- That's not true, I remember
Diane's birthday today.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.360
- Diane's birthday party,
you fucking remember

27:28.360 --> 27:29.810
Diane's birthday party!

27:30.886 --> 27:32.696
- Oh, for you I remember it.

27:32.696 --> 27:37.670
- For me, for me?

27:37.670 --> 27:40.210
You probably just said that because Vito

27:40.210 --> 27:41.690
had to remind you last night.

27:41.690 --> 27:42.870
- [Jeff] That's not true.

27:45.453 --> 27:46.286
- Really?

27:48.210 --> 27:49.455
- Really.

27:49.455 --> 27:52.205
(Maggie sobbing)

28:00.412 --> 28:02.912
I remember something else too.

28:04.300 --> 28:05.133
- Oh yeah?

28:07.128 --> 28:07.961
What?

28:16.377 --> 28:19.294
- I remember exactly what you like.

28:27.769 --> 28:30.026
(Maggie gasping)

28:30.026 --> 28:34.140
- You did remember.

28:34.140 --> 28:38.270
Oh Jeff.

28:41.401 --> 28:43.057
(phone buzzing)

28:43.057 --> 28:45.724
(Phone ringing)

28:50.230 --> 28:53.100
- The life of a, I'll say businessman

28:54.240 --> 28:55.390
can be trying at times.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.930
Long hours spent in dark alleyways

28:58.930 --> 29:01.370
can really take a toll on ya.

29:01.370 --> 29:02.820
Both mentally and physically.

29:06.587 --> 29:07.420
Hello.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.480
Yeah Ma, I'll be there.

29:20.210 --> 29:23.307
But then again, so can your own family.

29:24.815 --> 29:27.982
(soft dramatic music)

30:04.063 --> 30:06.450
I've been in and out of a
lot of houses my entire life,

30:06.450 --> 30:07.900
both in town and out of town.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.910
But one thing always
remains a constant, my mom.

30:12.780 --> 30:14.870
- Took you long enough,
where have you been?

30:14.870 --> 30:15.703
- [Lou] I'm here.

30:15.703 --> 30:16.970
- Oh, (kissing loudly), come on.

30:18.267 --> 30:19.290
Let's go, we're gonna be late.

30:19.290 --> 30:20.520
- I got you flowers.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.410
- Oh sweetheart, they're beautiful.

30:23.410 --> 30:25.610
They're perfect for your
father and your brother.

30:25.610 --> 30:26.550
- I got them for you.

30:26.550 --> 30:30.110
- Oh stop it, is traffic bad?

30:30.110 --> 30:31.540
- No, it was fine.

30:42.530 --> 30:44.060
- Happy anniversary, my love.

30:50.150 --> 30:52.890
- You see, after my dad
and brother passed away,

30:54.476 --> 30:55.926
we were left out on our feet.

31:00.875 --> 31:03.375
(mom sobbing)

31:06.720 --> 31:09.360
Even though my father didn't
get along with Mr. Mancini,

31:10.570 --> 31:12.890
he still took us under
his wing after Pop died.

31:14.300 --> 31:18.540
We owe everything to him.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.980
- I thought you'd like
another one of your toys

31:20.980 --> 31:22.030
to play with, Johnny.

31:30.030 --> 31:34.570
You're lucky Louis, lucky
they didn't take you that day.

31:35.904 --> 31:38.830
- I know, Mom, I know.

31:48.380 --> 31:50.641
- [Ma] You know, your
dad never really wanted

31:50.641 --> 31:52.020
any of the is for you.

31:52.020 --> 31:55.588
He worked so hard trying to get out.

31:55.588 --> 31:57.350
- Yeah Ma, I know.

31:57.350 --> 32:00.250
- That's why we started that
farm, he loved those animals.

32:02.410 --> 32:05.829
Why can't you just, why can't
you just find a nice girl,

32:05.829 --> 32:07.970
settle down somewhere warm.

32:09.462 --> 32:10.640
- I don't know, it's tough.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.158
Mancini really expects a lot.

32:12.158 --> 32:14.320
(Ma sighing)

32:14.320 --> 32:16.330
He really helped us out a
lot when Dad and Johnny died.

32:16.330 --> 32:17.820
He didn't have to.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.170
- Your dad just always
thought he was a puppet.

32:22.270 --> 32:24.900
You know what I'd really like to see?

32:24.900 --> 32:26.080
- [Lou] No Ma, what?

32:26.080 --> 32:27.860
- [Ma] You, happy again.

32:29.300 --> 32:32.083
- Ma, I am happy.

32:32.083 --> 32:37.049
♪ Happy birthday dear Diane ♪

32:37.049 --> 32:40.382
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

32:41.318 --> 32:46.318
(everyone cheering)
(everyone clapping)

32:47.620 --> 32:48.670
- Vito Mancini was known

32:48.670 --> 32:50.550
for conducting meetings during events.

32:50.550 --> 32:52.540
It allows him to kill
two birds with one stone.

32:52.540 --> 32:54.400
Spend time with his friends and family,

32:54.400 --> 32:56.400
while making it absolutely
fucking impossible

32:56.400 --> 32:57.600
for audio surveillance.

32:59.850 --> 33:01.550
- [Jeff] Thank you so much for having us.

33:01.550 --> 33:04.010
Maggie's really excited to be here.

33:04.010 --> 33:05.850
- Diane wouldn't have it any other way.

33:05.850 --> 33:07.480
- Was it it you wanted to see me about?

33:08.590 --> 33:10.181
- [Vito] Straight to the point.

33:10.181 --> 33:11.014
(static buzzing)

33:11.014 --> 33:11.847
Respect.

33:16.961 --> 33:18.180
- You know this would be
a hell of a lot easier

33:18.180 --> 33:19.740
if you didn't use the damn cell phone

33:19.740 --> 33:21.610
around all this gear.

33:21.610 --> 33:23.960
- Hey Princess Leia, I'm
trying to call my kid.

33:26.353 --> 33:27.660
- I'm just saying, doesn't really help

33:27.660 --> 33:28.760
with the interference.

33:30.020 --> 33:31.420
- Can't really see anything.

33:32.763 --> 33:34.690
Could you have parked any further away?

33:35.730 --> 33:37.200
- Yeah, go fuck yourself.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.850
- Would everyone just shut up.

33:44.070 --> 33:46.370
- Jeffery it seems we
have a rat in our midst.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.350
- [Jeff] You believe what the
cop was saying about DeFrange?

33:51.620 --> 33:55.480
- I don't need to believe him,
I sent him there to kill him.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.950
- You telling me you knew DeFrange

33:57.950 --> 33:59.730
was an informant from beforehand?

33:59.730 --> 34:02.400
- Jeffery, things under my
watch don't go unnoticed.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.910
I suspected DeFrange's
allegiance was elsewhere.

34:08.230 --> 34:09.560
After I got word that his cousin

34:09.560 --> 34:11.810
from the Windy City was nabbed,

34:11.810 --> 34:13.310
no charges ever filed on him.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.210
I have many moles Jeffery.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.810
They keep me apprise of
all my family matters.

34:24.290 --> 34:27.344
- Thank you Honey Bunny for
the gifts and the party.

34:27.344 --> 34:29.429
- Mmm, oh you are welcome.

34:29.429 --> 34:31.800
Oh, would you get me another

34:31.800 --> 34:33.659
while I finish up talking to Jeff here?

34:33.659 --> 34:34.493
- Of course.

34:36.830 --> 34:37.980
- You're a lucky man.

34:37.980 --> 34:40.300
- Jesus, don't I know it.

34:43.833 --> 34:44.666
- Let me ask ya.

34:44.666 --> 34:45.498
- [Vito] Hmm?

34:45.498 --> 34:46.400
- Why didn't you just
whack DeFrange at the house

34:46.400 --> 34:48.199
last night by yourself?

34:48.199 --> 34:51.050
- [Vito] 'Cause I want
you to dispose of it.

34:51.050 --> 34:52.250
- Vito, I can't do that.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.320
I'm, he's a made guy.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.020
He's got a wife and kids, what about them?

34:59.020 --> 35:00.170
- Yes, I know it, Jeff.

35:01.541 --> 35:02.870
I'll take care of it.

35:02.870 --> 35:04.790
- Come on, we gonna get this audio or not?

35:06.060 --> 35:06.893
- I'm trying.

35:06.893 --> 35:09.000
- Jesus.
- Jesus, I'm trying.

35:10.460 --> 35:11.970
- Why is she even here?

35:11.970 --> 35:13.080
She's worthless.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.610
- You know why, Agent Burns.

35:15.610 --> 35:17.660
She was the best young
trainee out of Quantico.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.457
Just like you were a few years ago.

35:20.675 --> 35:23.425
(static buzzing)

35:25.761 --> 35:28.560
- And I talked to the
families about the matter.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.901
They want it done quietly,
so as not to arouse

35:31.901 --> 35:36.630
any attention from the FBI. (laughs)

35:38.110 --> 35:39.020
- When you want this to be done?

35:39.020 --> 35:39.870
- [Vito] Tonight.

35:44.347 --> 35:45.899
- [Diane] Here's a drink for my big man.

35:45.899 --> 35:50.899
(Vito laughing)
(kissing loudly)

35:55.910 --> 36:00.300
- Oh, oh, you are the devil, oh.

36:05.210 --> 36:06.479
- Hey salud huh.

36:06.479 --> 36:07.568
(audience laughing)

36:07.568 --> 36:08.401
- Salud.

36:10.661 --> 36:14.444
(Jeff speaking in foreign language)

36:14.444 --> 36:17.031
- Oh damn, she is smoking hot.

36:17.031 --> 36:19.700
- Yeah well, she stonewalled
us the other night.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.533
- Bitch.

36:22.190 --> 36:23.460
- We've got the feds so pissed off

36:23.460 --> 36:25.010
at the newly wed Diane Mancini.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.351
It was not that she didn't talk,

36:28.351 --> 36:30.205
but how she went about doing it.

36:30.205 --> 36:32.788
(upbeat music)

36:37.582 --> 36:42.582
- Inhale, reach in low.

36:44.835 --> 36:45.668
Gently start to fall.

36:45.668 --> 36:49.418
(music drowning out speaker)

36:52.290 --> 36:57.290
Walk your hands forward.

37:11.658 --> 37:14.325
(door slamming)

37:17.120 --> 37:19.660
- [Agent] Mrs. Mancini, we need to talk.

37:20.980 --> 37:22.570
- Who the fuck are you?

37:22.570 --> 37:24.930
- We're with the FBI, have a few questions

37:24.930 --> 37:27.510
about your husband, Vincent Mancini.

37:27.510 --> 37:29.550
- I should have known
by the two fucking suits

37:29.550 --> 37:31.080
and the tacky shoes.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.790
- [Agent] Mrs. Mancini, how aware of you

37:32.790 --> 37:34.100
of your husband's affairs?

37:34.100 --> 37:37.110
- Oh I'd say I'm pretty aware
of my husband's affairs.

37:37.110 --> 37:38.400
- Oh well then you are pretty aware

37:38.400 --> 37:40.950
of just how dangerous a
man your husband really is.

37:42.180 --> 37:43.820
Look, you wanna share what you know,

37:43.820 --> 37:45.540
and we could offer you a deal.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.291
Maybe even protection.

37:47.291 --> 37:50.041
(Diane laughing)

37:56.425 --> 37:58.925
- You know, you're awful
tense for a man your age.

38:02.530 --> 38:06.530
Maybe I could help you find your center.

38:08.284 --> 38:11.910
I could teach you ways to find relaxation

38:11.910 --> 38:14.210
in that tight body of yours.

38:15.390 --> 38:16.760
- [Agent] Mrs. Mancini.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.188
- Yes.

38:18.188 --> 38:22.110
- Okay, Mrs. Mancini, you
can stop with the games.

38:22.110 --> 38:23.510
You've got two choices here.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.770
One, you can help us put Vincent Mancini

38:26.770 --> 38:29.610
away for a long time
and you get a new name

38:29.610 --> 38:32.410
and a nice house out in
Who-gives-a-fucksville.

38:33.630 --> 38:36.060
Or if you're lucky, you'll be charged

38:36.060 --> 38:38.490
as an accomplice when we
bring him down without you.

38:38.490 --> 38:41.150
And I say lucky because Vincent Mancini

38:41.150 --> 38:43.680
isn't the kind of man who likes lose ends.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.040
You do know what happened

38:46.040 --> 38:48.260
to the former Mrs. Mancini don't you?

38:50.320 --> 38:52.250
Probably the same thing
that'll happen to you

38:52.250 --> 38:53.640
once your end gets loose.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.410
- What's that supposed to mean?

38:56.410 --> 38:57.243
- That he had her killed

38:57.243 --> 38:59.320
on a shopping trip to New York City.

39:00.330 --> 39:01.390
Hey, that's right around the time

39:01.390 --> 39:04.020
he met the current Mrs. Mancini wasn't it?

39:04.020 --> 39:06.310
- I believe that's right, whoa.

39:08.194 --> 39:09.027
- Fuck you.

39:09.027 --> 39:10.180
You actually think you can harass me

39:10.180 --> 39:12.310
into talking with your bullshit?

39:12.310 --> 39:13.810
- [Agent] Bullshit, come here.

39:16.230 --> 39:17.380
You call this bullshit?

39:19.237 --> 39:20.880
The sick bastard had his own wife killed

39:20.880 --> 39:22.690
while she was in the bathtub.

39:22.690 --> 39:24.811
Strangled to death with her fucking bra.

39:24.811 --> 39:25.644
(lady gasping)

39:25.644 --> 39:27.890
Thrashing, fighting, till her last breath.

39:29.050 --> 39:31.550
They didn't find her till
the following afternoon.

39:32.521 --> 39:34.090
And don't think for one second

39:34.090 --> 39:35.790
he won't do the same thing to you.

39:36.627 --> 39:39.060
I am offering you a way out here.

39:39.060 --> 39:41.370
Help us before he decides toss you aside.

39:41.370 --> 39:43.720
Do you really wanna go to jail?

39:43.720 --> 39:47.213
Or worse, tits up strangled
with your own goddamn underwear?

39:47.213 --> 39:50.071
(dramatic music)

39:50.071 --> 39:51.371
- I rarely wear underwear.

39:55.618 --> 40:00.618
- Oh, you see what the
FBI didn't realize is,

40:01.540 --> 40:05.260
Diane Mancini knew exactly
who her husband was.

40:05.260 --> 40:07.860
And trust me, she was
no damsel in distress

40:07.860 --> 40:08.760
who needed saving.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.249
Now they met back in Chicago
when Vito was on business

40:12.249 --> 40:14.610
and she was in this artsy play.

40:15.470 --> 40:18.370
You know, the kind where they
wear more skin than costume.

40:19.893 --> 40:23.020
Anyways, for the highlight of the show,

40:23.020 --> 40:25.860
she comes out center stage,

40:25.860 --> 40:27.900
up on a pedestal completely naked.

40:29.180 --> 40:31.400
For Vito, it was love at first sight.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.020
And it wasn't too soon after that,

40:34.020 --> 40:36.550
that she felt the same way about him.

40:36.550 --> 40:39.210
Only problem was, Vito's wife.

40:39.210 --> 40:41.710
And who wants to deal
with a messy divorce?

40:41.710 --> 40:44.707
I'll give you one guess whose idea it was.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.560
- Well this has been fun boys,

40:50.560 --> 40:53.060
but I've got things to do,
so if you'll excuse me.

41:00.530 --> 41:01.363
Night boys.

41:06.170 --> 41:09.340
- Well that didn't go as
well as I would have liked.

41:09.340 --> 41:11.900
- That's okay, we'll
wear her down eventually.

41:14.460 --> 41:16.530
- No, you won't.

41:19.632 --> 41:22.860
(upbeat music)

41:22.860 --> 41:25.320
John DeFrange, a pretty funny guy

41:25.320 --> 41:27.756
if you weren't on the
butt end of his jokes.

41:27.756 --> 41:30.000
He was always trying to
be the life of the party.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.700
Got in him trouble a few
time, but luckily for him

41:32.700 --> 41:35.200
the family was always
there to get his back.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.770
Although lately, seemed
to be getting rather close

41:37.770 --> 41:40.600
to Mancini and pushing
hard against Jeffery Torin.

41:40.600 --> 41:42.764
That's pretty big no-nos,
since Jeff's whole family

41:42.764 --> 41:45.100
had been taken by mob
heads during the Cold War

41:45.100 --> 41:46.360
between Cleveland and Pittsburgh.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.000
But that was before the family united

41:48.000 --> 41:51.160
against the common goal,
ridding the town of the FBI.

41:51.160 --> 41:55.550
- Well look, I it ain't the
two cornholers. (laughs)

41:57.160 --> 41:59.750
So, what has old Vito
got us doing tonight?

41:59.750 --> 42:00.790
- Mancini wants us to get--

42:00.790 --> 42:03.011
- Hey, hey, hey, why
don't you grab me a pint,

42:03.011 --> 42:04.470
while I talk to these guys.

42:04.470 --> 42:05.680
- Why don't you kiss my ass.

42:05.680 --> 42:09.090
- I better get my shots first! (laughs)

42:10.020 --> 42:12.450
- You finish being a show clown?

42:12.450 --> 42:14.140
- She felt like a he-she anyways.

42:15.080 --> 42:17.640
Never mind me, it's not a penis

42:17.640 --> 42:21.830
it's just my oversized
clitoris! (laughing)

42:23.841 --> 42:26.173
You ever fuck one of those things before?

42:26.173 --> 42:27.006
(man whistling)

42:27.006 --> 42:28.310
It'll give you nightmares for a month.

42:30.470 --> 42:32.080
What, not funny?

42:33.190 --> 42:35.140
Okay, okay, all work and no play.

42:35.140 --> 42:36.470
- Mancini wants us to scare

42:36.470 --> 42:38.820
this country club worker a little bit.

42:38.820 --> 42:40.000
- So what, we bop the guy?

42:40.000 --> 42:41.240
- No, we don't bop the guy.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.640
- Are you crazy, motherfucker?

42:42.640 --> 42:44.080
- [John] People scare
better when they're dying,

42:44.080 --> 42:44.913
that's all I'm saying.

42:44.913 --> 42:46.780
- Okay Henry Fonda, look we ride together.

42:46.780 --> 42:48.150
You're driving, your riding shotgun,

42:48.150 --> 42:49.800
you're just so trigger happy man.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.490
- That's the best you got?

42:52.490 --> 42:54.320
That's not even an insult.

42:54.320 --> 42:58.390
I love Steve McQueen
motherfuckers, lets ride! (laughs)

43:07.760 --> 43:09.510
- Summer nights were crisp and dark

43:10.360 --> 43:11.660
perfect for the underworld's dealings

43:11.660 --> 43:13.310
of scaring the shit outta people.

43:14.730 --> 43:17.380
But that night, Jeff has
something different in mind.

43:18.490 --> 43:20.740
I still don't understand
why he didn't tell me prior.

43:23.330 --> 43:24.163
- Make a left over here,

43:24.163 --> 43:25.110
we're gonna go in the back way

43:25.110 --> 43:26.640
so he won't see us coming.

43:26.640 --> 43:27.660
- Bt the club isn't for another mile.

43:27.660 --> 43:29.356
- Just fucking do it, Lou!

43:29.356 --> 43:32.260
- Okay, that's gonna
be a long fucking walk.

43:32.260 --> 43:34.490
- I need the fresh air anyway.

43:34.490 --> 43:36.320
DeFrange hand me your gun.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.830
- Fuck you, why?

43:37.830 --> 43:39.870
- Because, I don't want
you killing anybody

43:39.870 --> 43:41.710
'cause you're a fucking lunatic.

43:41.710 --> 43:43.760
Plus Mancini wants this
to be done delicately.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.250
- Well fuck him too, I'm not
giving you my gun cocksuckers.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.870
- [Lou] Just fucking do it.

43:47.870 --> 43:50.030
The sooner we get this done,
the sooner we can get home.

43:50.030 --> 43:51.700
- Take it easy, Lou.

43:51.700 --> 43:53.190
Fine, take the fucking gun.

43:53.190 --> 43:54.770
I don't care, but I want it returned

43:54.770 --> 43:55.930
in the order in which it was received.

43:55.930 --> 43:57.010
- How 'bout I shove it up your ass

43:57.010 --> 43:58.250
and pull the trigger, motherfucker?

43:58.250 --> 43:59.500
- You wanna do it right now, cocksucker?

43:59.500 --> 44:00.560
- Let's go.
- Let's go then.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.290
Let's go, huh, kick your
ass, motherfucker. (laughs)

44:03.290 --> 44:05.410
- [Lou] Sit the fuck down.

44:05.410 --> 44:07.957
Jesus fucking Christ, I'm trying to drive.

44:07.957 --> 44:09.000
Fucking bitch.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.200
- [Jeff] Fucking Christ.

44:12.390 --> 44:14.090
Lou, this is good, pull over here.

44:15.250 --> 44:20.250
- [Lou] All right.

44:31.470 --> 44:33.130
- DeFrange knew his fate,

44:33.130 --> 44:35.230
he just wasn't allowing himself to see it.

44:36.713 --> 44:38.360
And I knew too.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.570
The moment we turned down
this godforsaken road.

44:42.338 --> 44:43.171
Oh fuck.

44:43.171 --> 44:44.004
- [John] Cut that shit out Jeff.

44:44.004 --> 44:44.910
- [Jeff] How's your little cousin doing

44:44.910 --> 44:46.750
after Chicago these days?

44:46.750 --> 44:48.247
- [John] What the fuck you talking about?

44:48.247 --> 44:49.080
(gun cocking)

44:49.080 --> 44:51.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, but how did you?

44:51.090 --> 44:52.432
- No buts, Mancini found out

44:52.432 --> 44:54.630
and you know what's coming.

44:54.630 --> 44:56.080
- [John] Jeff, I've got a wife and kids.

44:56.080 --> 44:57.590
- [Jeff] That you treat like shit.

44:58.470 --> 45:01.170
Now fucking stop giving
me crybaby bullshit.

45:01.170 --> 45:02.390
- [John] Lou, Lou.

45:02.390 --> 45:04.320
- Hey, don't look at me.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.153
This Jeff's show.

45:05.153 --> 45:06.730
- [Jeff] He had nothing to do with this.

45:06.730 --> 45:08.310
Mancini wants this to be done quietly

45:08.310 --> 45:09.470
as the not arouse the attention

45:09.470 --> 45:11.860
of your little FBI buddies you queer.

45:11.860 --> 45:13.830
- [John] That was my little
cousin, I had to do it.

45:13.830 --> 45:14.663
He would never

45:14.663 --> 45:15.496
make it inside.
- Not my concern,

45:15.496 --> 45:16.640
open the trunk!

45:16.640 --> 45:18.620
- Wait, wait, wait, what the
fuck did you put in my trunk?

45:18.620 --> 45:19.453
- [Jeff] Don't worry about it,

45:19.453 --> 45:20.850
open the fucking goddamn trunk now!

45:23.027 --> 45:23.860
Move!

45:25.045 --> 45:26.860
- In our line of work,
its only a few things

45:26.860 --> 45:28.010
that can be in a trunk.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.320
Golf clubs and a shovel.

45:32.320 --> 45:33.850
- [Jeff] Pick it up!

45:33.850 --> 45:36.340
- Fitting, gangster's burial, so to speak.

45:38.793 --> 45:40.720
Now that I look back at it, kinda sad.

45:41.980 --> 45:44.750
Yo, yo, yo, yo, you
sure you wanna do this?

45:44.750 --> 45:45.583
He's fucking made.

45:45.583 --> 45:47.340
- You don't think I know that Lou?

45:47.340 --> 45:49.380
Mancini's orders, the family has spoken.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.390
- Okay, but I'm not gonna be the one

45:52.390 --> 45:54.180
buying his kids fucking
Christmas presents.

45:54.180 --> 45:56.170
- Mancini's got that taken care of.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.600
Hey you green tie joker bastard fuck,

45:58.600 --> 46:01.610
you ready to be my bitch
caddy for the night, huh?

46:01.610 --> 46:02.930
If you're lucky, maybe I'll let you live

46:02.930 --> 46:04.690
to play all 18, huh.

46:04.690 --> 46:06.830
Don't be scared, get on
your knees and crawl bitch,

46:06.830 --> 46:08.340
get on your knees and crawl!

46:08.340 --> 46:10.150
Go, move, move!

46:15.020 --> 46:15.853
- Fuck.

46:24.314 --> 46:26.094
It never felt right to me.

46:26.094 --> 46:27.494
A man digging his own grave.

46:28.520 --> 46:30.170
Torture, especially in my line of work,

46:30.170 --> 46:31.320
it gets a man thinking.

46:32.490 --> 46:34.490
Has him just waiting for the inevitable.

46:35.550 --> 46:37.430
I'd rather die in the streets.

46:37.430 --> 46:39.000
At least go out with some fucking dignity.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.170
That's what this was all about.

46:41.170 --> 46:44.110
A no name grave, swallowed whole,

46:44.110 --> 46:45.510
dead in a fucking sand trap.

46:46.377 --> 46:49.377
(DeFrange grunting)

46:52.734 --> 46:54.210
- [Jeff] All right, that's enough.

46:54.210 --> 46:55.043
Don't get tired.

46:55.043 --> 46:57.050
- [John] I'm not done yet.

46:58.390 --> 47:01.860
- [Jeff] I don't care John,
show some dignity, get out!

47:01.860 --> 47:06.720
- [John] Please Jeffy, hey
Jeff, you don't have to do this.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.970
I could go away, no one'll ever know.

47:10.100 --> 47:11.100
You'll never see me again.

47:11.100 --> 47:12.010
- Johnny, really?

47:12.010 --> 47:13.146
- Yeah.

47:13.146 --> 47:13.979
- You don't have to do this?

47:13.979 --> 47:14.812
- [John] No, no.

47:14.812 --> 47:15.645
- You hear that, I don't have to do this.

47:15.645 --> 47:16.730
- [John] Yeah.

47:16.730 --> 47:17.563
- Fuck you, I'm doing it.

47:17.563 --> 47:18.600
You have any words you want to say

47:18.600 --> 47:20.097
before I fucking kill you?

47:20.097 --> 47:23.182
- [John] Yeah, you, fuck you.

47:23.182 --> 47:26.040
- Fuck me, huh, huh?

47:26.962 --> 47:28.389
(gun banging)

47:28.389 --> 47:29.683
Fuck you!

47:29.683 --> 47:32.001
Fuck you!
(gun banging)

47:32.001 --> 47:33.501
Fuck you and the fucking boss!

47:34.490 --> 47:36.070
Fuck you!

47:36.070 --> 47:36.903
- [Lou] Do you think you could've

47:36.903 --> 47:39.210
given him some time to finish?

47:39.210 --> 47:42.450
- Yeah sure, salivate a
little more, don't you think?

47:42.450 --> 47:46.580
Fucking hungry, starving,
Maggie made some chicken parm,

47:46.580 --> 47:48.370
wanna get the fuck outta here.

47:48.370 --> 47:50.070
There's leftovers, you wanna come?

47:51.580 --> 47:52.700
- Couldn't you have at least shot him

47:52.700 --> 47:54.850
so he fell all the way
in the fucking hole?

47:56.570 --> 47:58.050
- Got the hammer and snips?

47:58.050 --> 47:59.380
- [Lou] No, why the
fuck would I have that?

47:59.380 --> 48:01.180
I didn't even know this
was going on tonight.

48:02.170 --> 48:03.729
- [Jeff] If you're gonna
fucking bitch at me,

48:03.729 --> 48:04.910
I'll go get 'em.

48:04.910 --> 48:06.340
- [Lou] Jeff, you really
need to see somebody.

48:06.340 --> 48:07.960
- [Jeff] What are you talking 'bout?

48:07.960 --> 48:09.210
- [Lou] A fucking shrink.

48:10.970 --> 48:13.520
Jeff and I have dealt with
situations in the past.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.590
But none so close to home.

48:15.590 --> 48:17.350
I mean whacking one of our own,

48:17.350 --> 48:19.210
that hasn't been done in a while.

48:19.210 --> 48:21.340
And Jeff keeping me out of the loop,

48:21.340 --> 48:23.280
that gives me knots in my
stomach just thinking about

48:23.280 --> 48:25.100
what else might be planned in the future.

48:29.620 --> 48:31.650
- Easy there Mr. Soreno, it's the tin man.

48:31.650 --> 48:33.697
I just wanna talk for a few minutes.

48:33.697 --> 48:35.050
- [Lou] Go fuck yourself.

48:35.050 --> 48:36.300
That'll do you some good.

48:39.806 --> 48:41.106
- I'd rather fuck my wife.

48:42.220 --> 48:44.070
Listen, if you cooperate, I'll leave.

48:45.470 --> 48:47.850
Must've been a real dirty job last night.

48:49.070 --> 48:52.560
Well, if you ever wanna talk
about it, I'll be around.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.370
Just think of me as your priest,

48:54.370 --> 48:56.620
confess all and you shall be redeemed.

48:59.323 --> 49:00.850
- I'm not getting on my knees for you.

49:15.448 --> 49:17.955
- Hmm, well if it isn't
my favorite customer.

49:17.955 --> 49:20.130
What can I get cha?

49:20.130 --> 49:22.180
- Uh, I'll just have a cup of coffee.

49:23.230 --> 49:24.559
- Black?
- Yeah, yeah.

49:24.559 --> 49:27.300
- [Wendy] Cool.

49:27.300 --> 49:29.390
What's wrong, is everything okay?

49:29.390 --> 49:30.680
- [Lou] Not exactly.

49:30.680 --> 49:31.513
- Okay.

49:33.190 --> 49:34.340
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

49:35.608 --> 49:37.280
- Is it Sunday already, jeez.

49:38.560 --> 49:39.881
- [Wendy] What do you mean?

49:39.881 --> 49:43.230
- Hmm, it reminds me of my
mom after my dad passed.

49:44.170 --> 49:45.710
She always used to take me to breakfast

49:45.710 --> 49:46.940
every Sunday morning before church.

49:46.940 --> 49:49.624
It was just us you
know, kind of our thing.

49:49.624 --> 49:51.850
- Hmm, reminds me of my family too,

49:51.850 --> 49:54.270
minus the breakfast though, we was poor.

49:54.270 --> 49:55.103
Be right back.

49:55.103 --> 49:55.936
- [Lou] Okay.

49:58.264 --> 49:59.781
- [Wendy] Hey, what can I get you guys?

49:59.781 --> 50:00.834
- [Mom] I'll have a water please.

50:00.834 --> 50:01.667
- [Wendy] A water.

50:01.667 --> 50:02.500
- [Child] Chocolate milk for me please.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.011
- [Wendy] Chocolate.

50:04.011 --> 50:05.910
- Orange pop for me.

50:05.910 --> 50:08.100
- [Wendy] Awesome, I
shall get that for you

50:08.100 --> 50:09.570
with extra chocolate.

50:12.450 --> 50:13.420
- [Lou] Hey ah.

50:13.420 --> 50:14.640
- Yep.

50:14.640 --> 50:16.746
- I got their bill covered,
get 'em whatever they want.

50:16.746 --> 50:18.090
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:18.090 --> 50:19.470
- [Wendy] Why?

50:19.470 --> 50:21.610
- Being a single mom can't be easy.

50:21.610 --> 50:24.770
Lord knows mine had it pretty tough.

50:24.770 --> 50:26.108
And I always had somebody
there to help me out,

50:26.108 --> 50:27.708
so just kinda paying it forward.

50:30.006 --> 50:31.570
Hey, I was looking at that.

50:32.520 --> 50:35.584
- Well look like you could
use a home-cooked breakfast.

50:35.584 --> 50:37.290
- Yeah, I could.

50:39.640 --> 50:42.360
- Why don't you come out
with me to the country.

50:42.360 --> 50:44.760
And I'll cook you something good.

50:44.760 --> 50:47.780
Here you go, chocolate milk, what.

50:49.379 --> 50:51.780
- It's funny, in a blink of an eye

50:51.780 --> 50:53.850
sometimes things can
change for the better.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.780
So when you say nice country breakfast,

51:00.940 --> 51:01.870
what exactly do you mean?

51:01.870 --> 51:03.880
- The best damn breakfast you ever had.

51:04.740 --> 51:06.180
- [Lou] But why me?

51:06.180 --> 51:08.015
- Hmm, just paying it forward.

51:08.015 --> 51:10.150
(both laughing)

51:10.150 --> 51:11.964
- Okay then, plus I haven't
been out to the country

51:11.964 --> 51:14.400
in a long time, since I was a kid.

51:14.400 --> 51:15.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:19.270 --> 51:22.760
- So uh, how does a girl like
you afford a place like this?

51:22.760 --> 51:24.546
- What, a waitress can't afford it?

51:24.546 --> 51:25.700
- [Lou] Uh.

51:25.700 --> 51:29.590
- No, my grandfather passed
away a few years back

51:29.590 --> 51:32.690
and I inherited it from him.

51:32.690 --> 51:35.140
And it's been really hard to
take care of this place alone.

51:37.020 --> 51:38.200
- So what about your parents?

51:38.200 --> 51:39.520
Why don't they help out?

51:39.520 --> 51:41.310
- You mean my Petri dish
father, who I never met?

51:41.310 --> 51:43.550
He left before I was born.

51:43.550 --> 51:45.230
My mother, that's another story.

51:45.230 --> 51:46.330
She was a drug addict.

51:47.230 --> 51:49.430
Overdosed in front of me when I was four.

51:49.430 --> 51:50.800
I rant out into the street screaming

51:50.800 --> 51:52.790
for someone to help, but nobody came.

51:54.150 --> 51:56.090
My grandfather picked me up

51:56.090 --> 51:57.940
at the police station and took me in.

51:59.140 --> 52:00.540
He was always so good to me.

52:02.400 --> 52:04.050
He raised me to be a good person.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.870
God knows where I'd be without him.

52:07.870 --> 52:10.150
Anyway, enough of my dismal past.

52:10.150 --> 52:11.520
So how is the food, any good?

52:11.520 --> 52:13.630
- Ah, it's amazing.

52:13.630 --> 52:15.751
I haven't had a meal
this good in a long time.

52:15.751 --> 52:17.820
- Good. (chuckles)

52:17.820 --> 52:20.900
- So, actually what am I supposed to do

52:20.900 --> 52:22.610
to pay you back for this?

52:22.610 --> 52:26.120
- That's a surprise, so you better eat up.

52:26.120 --> 52:28.210
- Okay. (chuckles)

52:37.873 --> 52:40.270
How do you feel about doing some cleaning?

52:40.270 --> 52:42.270
- Hey for the chef, anything.

52:43.330 --> 52:47.720
- Wheelbarrow's over there,
and the two back stalls.

52:47.720 --> 52:48.812
- Aren't you gonna supervise?

52:48.812 --> 52:53.812
- [Chuckles] I will, I'll be right back.

52:54.005 --> 52:59.005
- Okay.

53:03.236 --> 53:08.236
Oh man.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.800
Man I must be seeing things.

53:17.850 --> 53:21.990
Just like Frankie's song,
you're just too good to be true.

53:21.990 --> 53:23.240
- Well hey there, cowboy.

53:24.540 --> 53:28.370
Why don't you take a break and
take Cisco here for a ride.

53:28.370 --> 53:30.570
- Okay, but I'm warning
you, it's been a long time

53:30.570 --> 53:31.820
since I've been on one of these.

53:31.820 --> 53:34.240
- I figured a man like you
knew how to take the reigns.

53:37.268 --> 53:40.018
(relaxing music)

53:43.510 --> 53:46.412
- Well, do you really
like your kind of work?

53:46.412 --> 53:48.780
- Ah, it can be trying at times.

53:48.780 --> 53:49.750
- What do you mean?

53:50.840 --> 53:53.440
- Well I've never really
had a choice in the matter.

53:56.530 --> 54:00.050
You see, my pop was brought
out here by the company,

54:01.233 --> 54:04.120
and he ended up dying on the
job along with my brother.

54:04.120 --> 54:04.953
- Oh.
- Yeah.

54:09.334 --> 54:11.360
- I don't get it though,
it doesn't seem like

54:11.360 --> 54:13.500
this type of work suits
a caring guy like you.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.370
I mean why, why don't you just leave?

54:16.253 --> 54:18.640
- (chuckles) I wish I could.

54:21.488 --> 54:22.990
I don't have anywhere to go.

54:22.990 --> 54:25.290
I owe so much of my existence
to a friend of the family.

54:25.290 --> 54:28.320
I mean he did so much for
us through the hard times.

54:28.320 --> 54:31.000
He basically gave my mom the
house that she lives in now.

54:32.181 --> 54:34.760
Plus if I did go, I'd be all alone.

54:36.697 --> 54:39.430
You know at least here, I
have my friend Jeff and you.

54:41.142 --> 54:45.010
- (laughs) Me, oh gosh, well yeah,

54:45.010 --> 54:47.417
you're growing on me a little bit too.

54:47.417 --> 54:48.470
- Oh thank you.

54:50.440 --> 54:51.290
- So are you hot?

54:52.800 --> 54:54.400
- Yeah, I mean it's kinda muggy.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.770
- I have a surprise, I
think you'll like it.

54:58.770 --> 55:01.460
I'm gonna go get Jasper, follow me.

55:01.460 --> 55:02.293
- Okay.

55:25.444 --> 55:26.277
Oh man.

55:29.816 --> 55:33.440
This place certainly is beautiful.

55:33.440 --> 55:35.870
I haven't been this relaxed in a long tie.

55:35.870 --> 55:38.330
So how'd you ever found this spot?

55:38.330 --> 55:40.624
- See that path right over there?

55:40.624 --> 55:41.457
- Yeah.

55:41.457 --> 55:43.210
- My grandfather took me for rides

55:43.210 --> 55:46.030
and then he'd lead me here
to cool off in the water.

55:47.450 --> 55:50.054
It used to be like my
own private vacation.

55:50.054 --> 55:53.080
- [Lou] Oh, it certainly is amazing.

55:53.080 --> 55:55.580
- [Wendy] Yeah, it reminds
me of better times.

55:55.580 --> 55:58.080
Not that today is turning
out to be rather special.

55:58.080 --> 55:59.710
- Oh yeah, you really mean that?

55:59.710 --> 56:01.270
- Of course I do.

56:01.270 --> 56:04.270
Look, I don't do things
that don't make me happy,

56:04.270 --> 56:08.050
except my job, it's an income,
that's its only purpose,

56:08.050 --> 56:11.790
and it puts you in my
freaking break in the morning.

56:11.790 --> 56:14.220
- [Lou] Yeah, well we
all have to do things

56:14.220 --> 56:15.930
that we don't want to do.

56:15.930 --> 56:17.980
You know just to get ahead.

56:17.980 --> 56:20.128
- Is that what you're
trying to do, get some head?

56:20.128 --> 56:21.980
- (laughs) Who me, nah?

56:24.533 --> 56:26.810
- Well what are you
expecting out of today?

56:26.810 --> 56:28.210
- I don't know, you tell me.

56:29.450 --> 56:30.620
I just took a beautiful waitress out

56:30.620 --> 56:33.410
for some much need R&R out in the country.

56:33.410 --> 56:34.800
- You really mean that?

56:34.800 --> 56:37.400
- Of course I do, I wouldn't
have said it otherwise.

56:38.327 --> 56:40.727
Good advice I learned
from a new friend of mine.

56:41.590 --> 56:43.731
- [Wendy] Cute, cute, stealing the words

56:43.731 --> 56:45.950
right out my mouth, yeah. (laughs)

56:45.950 --> 56:47.250
- I'd rather steal a kiss.

56:48.606 --> 56:49.500
- Then why don't you?

56:52.460 --> 56:55.010
- Nah, I don't want to
make it too easy for ya.

56:55.010 --> 56:56.870
Just stay here with me for
a lil while longer, okay?

57:03.800 --> 57:06.700
I could've sat there
forever with her in my arms.

57:06.700 --> 57:08.760
I was watching the water
cascade over the rocks

57:08.760 --> 57:10.550
into the pool below.

57:10.550 --> 57:13.533
It seemed peace had finally come over me.

57:13.533 --> 57:15.480
It had been such a long time.

57:15.480 --> 57:17.429
We had connected deep that day.

57:17.429 --> 57:21.030
In a way that couldn't
be expressed into words.

57:21.030 --> 57:24.000
The time, it seemed to
slow down to a stop.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.250
So, I drank it in.

57:36.100 --> 57:39.730
Walking up to my apartment,
I began to realize something.

57:39.730 --> 57:41.450
Hope. (sighs)

57:43.515 --> 57:45.430
I fucking thought I smelled bacon.

57:45.430 --> 57:46.940
- Welcome home Mr. Soreno.

57:46.940 --> 57:47.773
- [Lou] How'd you even--

57:47.773 --> 57:48.942
- Hey you.

57:48.942 --> 57:49.775
- Oh for fuck's sake.

57:49.775 --> 57:50.608
- [Agent] I hope you don't mind,

57:50.608 --> 57:51.490
I made myself a cup of coffee.

57:51.490 --> 57:52.830
- [Agent] Oh and checked out your place.

57:52.830 --> 57:54.230
- Do you have a permit for all those guns.

57:54.230 --> 57:55.880
- Do you have a permit for being a cunt?

57:55.880 --> 57:57.280
- [Agent] Oh, well yes I do.

57:58.780 --> 58:00.090
- [Lou] So what the fuck do you want?

58:00.090 --> 58:02.830
- Oh, it's not to be jerked
off, I can tell you that.

58:02.830 --> 58:05.140
I fucked around enough with you dumb lops.

58:05.140 --> 58:07.230
- Oh, you're tired of
being a little bitch?

58:07.230 --> 58:08.730
Don't be tearing up on me now.

58:12.146 --> 58:14.010
If any of you think I'm
gonna flip on Mancini--

58:14.010 --> 58:15.160
- [Agent] And Degorgio.

58:16.038 --> 58:17.220
- (chuckles) Speaking of jerking off.

58:17.220 --> 58:19.300
Is that why you brought her along?

58:19.300 --> 58:21.270
Yeah, you with the dick
sucking lips back there.

58:21.270 --> 58:22.710
I bet you could cut the balls in a--

58:22.710 --> 58:23.820
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:23.820 --> 58:26.140
- Whoa honey, I was talking 'bout him.

58:26.140 --> 58:26.973
- [Agent] Oh.

58:26.973 --> 58:28.370
- Plus I can tell you know
your way around a cock

58:28.370 --> 58:29.660
since you seem to have one.

58:29.660 --> 58:31.510
- We know what you fellas
have been doing here.

58:31.510 --> 58:32.890
With the illegal gambling.

58:32.890 --> 58:34.860
We've had our ears to the
ground for a while now,

58:34.860 --> 58:37.040
but suddenly it went deaf.

58:37.040 --> 58:38.320
You know anything about that?

58:38.320 --> 58:41.530
- Ears to the ground, what are
you fucking Indians now too?

58:41.530 --> 58:42.880
It's feathers, not dots.

58:43.810 --> 58:46.240
Fuck you, you had an
informant in our crew.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.640
You think we didn't know that?

58:47.640 --> 58:48.810
- Oh didn't you?

58:48.810 --> 58:50.545
- Look, I'm giving you an out here.

58:50.545 --> 58:52.200
- If you don't start cooperating,

58:52.200 --> 58:53.860
we're gonna have to
throw every book at you.

58:53.860 --> 58:55.870
- Oh yeah, what about the "Bible"?

58:55.870 --> 58:57.470
Pretty sacrilegious don't you think,

58:57.470 --> 58:59.370
since the three of you
were sworn in on it.

58:59.370 --> 59:01.310
- Well it's not like
you even read it anyway.

59:01.310 --> 59:03.320
I'm sure your father would be proud.

59:03.320 --> 59:05.150
- Okay, I think it's about time

59:05.150 --> 59:06.750
you get the fuck outta my house.

59:08.148 --> 59:09.563
And if you ever think I'm
gonna flip on the family,

59:09.563 --> 59:11.613
you're as sorely mistaken as his asshole.

59:13.130 --> 59:13.963
Or hers.

59:15.740 --> 59:17.730
- Oh family, is that what you call 'em?

59:17.730 --> 59:19.170
Well mine never gave my dad and brother

59:19.170 --> 59:20.250
a Youngstown tune-up.

59:20.250 --> 59:21.310
- [Lou] Excuse you?

59:21.310 --> 59:22.310
- Yeah, you didn't know?

59:22.310 --> 59:24.020
Mancini's the one who put
a hit out on your pops.

59:24.020 --> 59:25.300
- [Lou] What the fuck you say?

59:26.290 --> 59:29.250
- Well, I wouldn't wanna be
serving a caretaker like that.

59:32.420 --> 59:35.240
Yeah, we had evidence on the
hit he put out on your pop.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.650
But, the box seems to have gone missing

59:37.650 --> 59:39.200
due to corruption in the force.

59:40.480 --> 59:43.880
Anyway, you have yourself a
good day there, Mr. Soreno.

59:43.880 --> 59:45.250
- [Lou] It's Soreno.

59:45.250 --> 59:46.980
- Oh, say hi to your ma for me.

59:46.980 --> 59:49.150
And to that waitress, Wendy, too.

59:49.150 --> 59:51.420
She's got a great ass!

59:51.420 --> 59:53.401
When I see an ass like that, I don't know,

59:53.401 --> 59:55.470
something comes outta me.

59:55.470 --> 59:56.710
I fucking love Pacino.

59:56.710 --> 59:58.650
- That was pretty close that time.

59:58.650 --> 59:59.483
Bye-bye.

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:01.748
- I need a new job.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.120
Shotgun.
- As if.

01:00:07.298 --> 01:00:10.850
- The fucking prick with
the mind games. (scoffs)

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.350
No way he's telling the truth.

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.640
Nah, he just wants me to flip.

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:20.196
In fucking losing my edge.

01:00:20.196 --> 01:00:24.472
I need to get some sleep.

01:00:24.472 --> 01:00:26.972
(Lou sighing)

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.228
(intense banging)

01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:36.228
In-fucking-credible.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.290
Goddammit, who is it?

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.030
- Good fucking morning sunshine,

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:49.490
merry fucking Christmas.

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.910
Happy holidays, what's
with you locking the door

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:53.108
and not answering your phone?

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.437
- Ah.

01:00:54.437 --> 01:00:56.000
- Ah, what are you gonna
do, lounge around all day

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.800
in your underwear, get dressed,
Mancini wants to see us.

01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:05.210
Oh, get dressed, Maggie's
waiting in the car.

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:06.060
- [Lou] What for?

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.377
- I don't know, he probably
wants to talk to us

01:01:08.377 --> 01:01:09.860
about last night or something.

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.740
He wants us over for dinner.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:12.720
- Ah, okay.

01:01:14.955 --> 01:01:15.960
- What, did you have
a hooker banging party

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:16.793
in here last night?

01:01:16.793 --> 01:01:19.870
Why do you always fucking look
like a slob, Jesus Christ?

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:21.530
- Yeah, it's a long fucking story.

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.980
Seems I'm never here anyways.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.300
- Look at me, Romeo, you don't look good.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.330
Those beautiful eyes of
yours, they're slacking.

01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:33.200
You need some sleep and
we need to get you laid.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.860
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.440
Let's fucking go.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.273
- Get your heat.

01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:48.470
- [Lou] Hey, let's grab a
bottle of something on our way.

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:49.390
- [Jeff] Yeah, I'll grab a two liter

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:50.358
bottle of soda, that's it.

01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:52.941
(Lou laughing)

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.800
- Normally it's an honor being
served from the boss' table,

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.050
but tonight, it felt a little different.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.560
Made me on edge after the
whole John DeFrange thing.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:18.720
Oh, amazing meal Mrs.
Mancini, it was delicious.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.070
- Yes, thank you ma'am.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.150
- Superb, I'm gonna have to get

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.870
the recipe from on on that dish.

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:26.050
- How 'bout right now,
it was my pleasure boys.

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:27.210
- [Vito] Thank you, honey.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.640
- You're welcome.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.510
Hey, Maggie and I are gonna
get desert ready for these two

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:35.335
and yours my dear, will be a little later.

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:38.770
- Ooh, (laughs) oh you
know exactly what I like.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:40.020
- Yes I do.
- Don't you?

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.640
Sorry, just a bit of banter.

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:52.330
Anyway, I wanted to thank
you two for indulging

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:53.790
in my wishes last night.

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.930
- [Jeff] No problem, boss.

01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:56.160
- Yeah boss, no problem.

01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:58.690
- And I wanted to apologize,

01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:03.131
for not letting you in the loop, Lou.

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:06.906
Yeah, I find it best if only one person

01:03:06.906 --> 01:03:08.760
knows it's a hit.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.210
- Thank you.

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:11.760
- It doesn't complicate things.

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:17.110
Especially if it's a
slippery snake like DeFrange.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:20.950
You can never trust a rat.

01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:23.470
His whole family are vermin.

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.000
Even his cousin David.

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:31.920
But I digress.

01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:38.270
You two did real good, so good in fact,

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:45.000
management, both Cleveland and Pittsburgh

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.070
have decided to promote you.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.330
- Promote?
- What?

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.190
- You two knuckleheads are
gonna be the first two made

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.070
in the last 12 years.

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:58.060
- That's fucking amazing.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.540
- Mr. Mancini, we're honored, thank you.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.350
- Don't thank me, you thank Paul Degorgio.

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:05.540
He's the one that approved the order.

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.690
- Lou, congratulations, congratulations.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.600
- And you, young Jeffery,
better thank Francis Trimbou

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.170
when you see him on Friday.

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:19.550
It was his idea.

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:21.220
- What do you mean Friday?

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:24.400
- [Vito] That's when the
ceremony's gonna take place.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.233
- Maggie!

01:04:25.233 --> 01:04:26.066
(man laughing)

01:04:26.066 --> 01:04:27.630
- [Maggie] What's going on baby?

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.630
- Lou and I are being made.

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:30.463
- [Maggie] What?

01:04:30.463 --> 01:04:31.296
- Thanks Boss, thanks.

01:04:31.296 --> 01:04:32.586
- [Maggie] Oh my god.

01:04:32.586 --> 01:04:34.570
(soft piano music)

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.910
- Louis, I'm sorry your father
couldn't be here to see this.

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:38.810
He was a good man.

01:04:40.302 --> 01:04:42.210
- Yeah, yeah he was.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.430
I really miss him.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.080
- Yeah, he'd be proud, I know it.

01:04:57.888 --> 01:05:00.388
- It's hard to tell what
could've, should've been,

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.624
but one things for sure,
Mancini really plays his cards

01:05:04.624 --> 01:05:05.810
close to the chest.

(upbeat music)

01:07:31.736 --> 01:07:33.530
- I only heard stories
about this as a kid.

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:35.900
Never did I think I'd actually
get to be a part of it.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.940
It was the highest honor to
be inducted as a wise guy.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.610
Ceremony that dates back all the way

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:42.170
to the founders in Sicily.

01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:43.620
Grand enough to befit a king.

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:46.800
With an almost spiritual undertone.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.880
Unlike anything I've ever seen before.

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:54.950
- We are gathered here
today to bear witness

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:57.320
to the making of two new family members.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.040
I feel like they're my own sons.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.330
This is not a ritual we choose lightly.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:07.990
There has been many years

01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:09.780
since a worthy soul has come forth.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.950
Today my family, we have two righteous men

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.340
ready to take that pledge.

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:23.990
Louis Soreno and Jeffery Torin.

01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:30.630
Both have seen much loss in
our senseless war for power.

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.109
Louis, with his father and his brother.

01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:40.430
Jeffery, with his two older brothers.

01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:47.990
Nothing is greater than a united front.

01:08:49.979 --> 01:08:51.979
That's why both families are here today.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:57.710
Paul and Francis, and their two knights.

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:04.319
Paul, please choose Lou's saint.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.840
- [Lou] Paul Degorgio,
one of the most feared

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.620
higher ups in the New York crime family.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.120
He was appointed at a young age top run

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.720
the Pittsburgh faction because
of his ruthless demeanor

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.040
and no nonsense attitude.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.350
He once had his entire crew
killed and their families,

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:30.229
for not bringing back all
the money from a bank heist.

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:31.729
They say he's mellowed out with age,

01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:33.479
but I wouldn't test him.

01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:41.580
- Wisely chosen, St George,
the patron saint of courage.

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:47.779
He was in a battle between
good and evil, good won.

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:54.010
Frank, please choose Jeffery's saint.

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:58.285
- [Lou] Frank Trimbou, direct
connection of the Chicago

01:09:58.285 --> 01:10:01.160
crime family through
the Cleveland faction.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.122
He was responsible for
ordering dozens of car bombings

01:10:03.122 --> 01:10:06.370
throughout Youngstown during
the feud between the families.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:07.815
Motherfucker practically
coined the phrase,

01:10:07.815 --> 01:10:10.950
Youngstown tune-up by himself.

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:13.200
This guy, he was a real son-of-a-bitch.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.770
- St Thomas Becket, the
patron saint of wealth.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.739
He rose to power and
riches, but was cut down

01:10:26.739 --> 01:10:28.990
by the king's men before his time.

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:37.350
Paul, Frank, as a baby, you
were baptized by your parents

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:41.330
into the Catholic faith.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:47.091
But today we baptize you
into the family by blood.

01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:49.924
(Jeffery gasping)

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:59.040
Paul, Frank, this drop of blood

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.060
symbolizes your birth into the family.

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:05.201
We are one until death.

01:11:05.201 --> 01:11:07.951
(dramatic music)

01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:17.110
This flame symbolizes your flesh.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.140
As the saint burns, so will burn your soul

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.710
if you betray this family.

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:31.760
You enter here freely, but
only leave through death.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:37.890
There are five rules that all
most follow in the family.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.270
Number one, be loyal.

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.680
Number two, be rational.

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.960
Number three, be a man of honor.

01:11:51.595 --> 01:11:55.400
Number four, be a stand out guy.

01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:01.880
And finally number five, show some class

01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:04.560
and be independent.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.460
In front of you both
sits the gun and dagger.

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:14.210
These are yours to carry at all times.

01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:17.980
You enter the family by gun and dagger,

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:21.900
you protect the family by gun and dagger,

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:28.000
you shall die by gun and dagger.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:35.650
Lou, Jeffery, welcome to the family.

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:39.610
(everyone clapping)

01:12:45.919 --> 01:12:47.240
(soft jazzy music)

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.930
- So Louie, how you enjoying
it here in Youngstown?

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:52.940
- Well you know things are--

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:56.090
- He's been working so
hard I hardly see him.

01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:58.390
- [Paul] I'm sure his
father would be proud.

01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:00.969
- No, actually he wouldn't.

01:13:00.969 --> 01:13:04.000
What do have him doing exactly?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:04.850
- Ma, please.

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:06.810
- Oh, well what he needs is a good woman

01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:07.643
to take care of him.

01:13:07.643 --> 01:13:09.610
Lord knows he's lost without one.

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:12.630
All right, all right, I'll shut up.

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:14.840
- No, no, no, that's quite
all right, Mrs. Soreno.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.530
I really appreciate
the inside information.

01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:19.910
Otherwise I'd never hear anything at all.

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:24.910
Besides, like your husband,
every prince needs a princess.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.970
But, not every king needs a queen.

01:13:31.465 --> 01:13:32.820
At least in my opinion.

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.710
Continue please.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.830
- Well, things have been,
they've been running smoothly.

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:41.530
Except for a few loose
screws in the machine

01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:43.180
that Mr. Mancini had us fix.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.040
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I heard about that.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.990
That's a good thing we caught it early.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:50.150
So Lou, let me ask you something.

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:53.030
How do you feel the
operation is running now?

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:56.510
Do you feel that we're
getting you properly prepared

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:58.660
for future involvement?

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.180
- Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.820
- The reason I'm asking
is because New York's

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.280
been pushing harder for more involvement.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.440
They feel the situation
needs to be a little more

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.000
equitable than it currently is,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.510
while still giving Vito his
leash, of course for now.

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:17.856
(glass chiming)

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.840
- After speaking with my wife and Francis

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.600
over the past few months, we decided

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:33.880
this would be a good time
to look into retirement.

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.030
I have been given control of this town

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:45.350
for nearly three decades, it's
time to give over the reigns

01:14:45.624 --> 01:14:49.730
to a close personal family friend of ours.

01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:56.292
I would like to announce my
successor, Jeffery Torin.

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:58.324
(everyone clapping)
(everyone cheering)

01:14:58.324 --> 01:15:00.666
(Vito laughing)

01:15:00.666 --> 01:15:01.962
Come here, come here.

01:15:01.962 --> 01:15:04.043
- Hey, hey, hey that's
excuse me, excuse me.

01:15:06.381 --> 01:15:10.298
(speaking in foreign language)

01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:13.390
Francis, don't you guys think
you should've spoke to me

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.340
before making this little announcement?

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.520
- What do you mean Mr. Degorgio, huh?

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:29.940
- It was our original understanding

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.560
that a successor was to be named

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.020
by the person in charge at the time.

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.090
For he would best know

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:37.484
who was competent enough to take over.

01:15:37.484 --> 01:15:40.430
- Oh, as you wish.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:51.720
Mr. Torin, congratulations, I
wanna wish you all the luck.

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.581
- Thank you.

01:16:02.581 --> 01:16:03.414
- Let's get the fuck outta here.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.650
- Hey, you coming out tonight right?

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:14.500
- [Lou] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so.

01:16:16.429 --> 01:16:18.110
- What do you mean, you guess so?

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:19.480
What do you mean, and
don't make me order you.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.299
- [Lou] Are you gonna play
that card already, come on now.

01:16:21.299 --> 01:16:22.207
Come on.

01:16:22.207 --> 01:16:23.040
(men laughing)

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.480
- I just want you to
come out and celebrate.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.860
That's it, that's all I'm asking.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.820
- Yeah, I know, I know.

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.537
I just gotta take her home
and I'll be out, okay?

01:16:28.537 --> 01:16:30.370
- Hey Ms. Soreno, how are you?

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.350
I'll see you tonight, all right?

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:33.183
- Sounds good.

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:35.590
- Love you so much, thank you.

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:37.375
- [Lou] Hey, come here brother,

01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:38.651
one more time for last night.

01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:40.721
- I know, you deserved
it Lou, you deserved it.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:44.301
- See you.

01:16:44.301 --> 01:16:45.545
(thunder crackling)

01:16:45.545 --> 01:16:46.378
It was supposed to be a day for me

01:16:46.378 --> 01:16:47.580
to have a go down in
the book of the family

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.160
dating all the way back to Sicily,

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.440
but honestly, it felt like I was

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.520
an even bigger social outcast.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.930
I could feel the tension in the family

01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:56.530
brewing even deeper than before.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.530
Now he was planning to
make a move, but what?

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.175
Now he certainly had that look.

01:17:07.175 --> 01:17:10.560
The kinda look of a man that
you knew you couldn't trust.

01:17:12.778 --> 01:17:15.361
(upbeat music)

01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:40.944
Nope.

01:17:42.807 --> 01:17:44.390
- [Man] Ooh, funny.

01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:48.310
- [Jeff] Stop, love you.

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.620
- [Damn] Damn, here you go Jeff.

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:53.909
- [Jeff] Thank you, Lou.

01:17:53.909 --> 01:17:54.742
- [Lou] It's a double.

01:17:54.742 --> 01:17:55.575
- Thank you, Lou.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.170
Lou, your pops would be
so proud of you brother.

01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:01.110
You really made something of yourself.

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:02.800
- Hey, your brothers would be too, pal.

01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.170
We've really come a long way.

01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:06.003
- Yes we have.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.500
You know, I wish my pops were around

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.500
right about now too.

01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:12.430
So I could bash his
fucking skull in myself.

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:14.180
He put my mom through so much shit.

01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:16.680
- [Lou] Hey, I'm sorry 'bout that, bro.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.780
And your brothers too.

01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:23.413
- Don't be, we got each other now.

01:18:23.413 --> 01:18:24.246
- [Men] Whoo!

01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:26.270
- And this beautiful
chick on stage right now.

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:27.871
- [Man] Whoo, yeah!

01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:30.168
(men catcalling)

01:18:30.168 --> 01:18:31.480
- [Jeff] Oh my god, get over here.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:33.893
This chick.

01:18:35.422 --> 01:18:36.750
Lou, did you see that fucking move?

01:18:40.141 --> 01:18:42.500
Oh my god, look at these
titties, I love you.

01:18:45.203 --> 01:18:46.790
Now why the fuck can't Maggie do that?

01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:50.183
Do that and I'll be home on
my hands and knees every night

01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:53.000
begging for fucking (yelling), whoo!

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.780
- [Both] Ass like a 10 year old boy.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.613
- [Jeff] Whoo!

01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:00.600
- Gotta love Bill Paxton.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.689
- [Jeff] He's in everything.

01:19:01.689 --> 01:19:03.830
(Lou laughing)

01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:07.350
- Hey, so speaking about Maggie,

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.190
how's she been?

01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:12.420
See seemed kinda pissed off
at the ceremony this morning.

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.140
- Yeah, she was giving
me some line of bullshit

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.260
like she didn't feel like going.

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.630
Even went as far as puking this morning,

01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:18.830
act like she was sick.

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:19.663
- What?

01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:23.200
- Fucking pissed about something.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.250
Such a grudge holder.

01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:27.430
Gives me the shit about
the formal family bullshit,

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.480
she hates that stuff.

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:32.700
Like how Diane practically
eye fucks the shit outta Vito

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:33.850
every waking second.

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:35.960
- [Lou] Yeah, you notice that too?

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.010
- Speak of the devil.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.630
How Vito lucked into that,
I'll never fucking know.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:42.953
Boss.

01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:49.540
- Lou, Jeff, what are
you doing down here Jeff?

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:54.700
- I was just, celebrating huh, I guess.

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.720
- You can't celebrate down here, Jeff.

01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:10.840
These lovely ladies
are gonna help you out.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.090
- Thank you, Mr. Mancini.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.980
- We'll take good care of him.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.130
- I bet you will.

01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:22.560
- [Jeff] Am I, oh shit, be right back.

01:20:25.129 --> 01:20:28.129
(upbeat rock music)

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.333
Shit!

01:20:41.859 --> 01:20:43.640
(laughs) Holy shit!

01:20:49.068 --> 01:20:51.810
- Hey, hey, hey, you're
next, you know. (laughs)

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:53.370
- Ooh, can I help?

01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:56.980
- Oh baby, anything you want.

01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.550
- I wanna give him
something to remember me by.

01:21:01.930 --> 01:21:05.880
- Ooh, oh she's calling in begging.

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:09.880
- Hey, I really can't Vito.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.500
- Yeah the fuck you can.

01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:16.840
And that's till mister to you, you prick.

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.790
Just because you're made now,

01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:21.740
doesn't mean you get to disobey orders.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.940
- I'm sorry, Mr. Mancini.

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.330
- I bet you are, but you
need to apologize to Diane.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.510
- Mrs. Mancini, I'm sorry.

01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:34.330
- That's okay, really.

01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:38.793
- It's just, I recently found someone

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:41.350
that I really connect with her.

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.390
- [Diane] That's so cute.

01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:46.970
- She ain't here right now, okay.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.400
Don't start acting like your father

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.200
and being all higher than thou art.

01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:55.290
You're one of us.

01:22:09.702 --> 01:22:11.441
- [Lou] I'll be right back.

01:22:11.441 --> 01:22:12.370
Gonna get some fresh air.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.670
- [Vito] Oh well, you
better hurry on back.

01:22:17.959 --> 01:22:20.570
I don't know how long I can contain

01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:23.890
this sexual firecracker on top of me.

01:22:25.262 --> 01:22:28.095
(Jeff vocalizing)

01:22:29.014 --> 01:22:30.030
- Do you like that, Daddy?

01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.980
- I love it, Mommy.

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.970
Lou, look at me now, baby!

01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:35.510
Look at me now, Louie!

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:38.750
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, whoo!

01:22:48.577 --> 01:22:49.910
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:51.424
- That's okay.

01:22:51.424 --> 01:22:52.440
- I just didn't see you there.

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.470
Do you need a light?

01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.740
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.573
- [Lou] Thank you.

01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:02.780
- So word is, you've been made.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.880
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:11.920
- What's poking through those
pants seems to beg to differ.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.690
Anyways, my boss tells me
I need to make this night

01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:17.740
special for you guys.

01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:19.883
- Oh yeah?

01:23:19.883 --> 01:23:24.600
- Yeah, does Mr. Soreno
wanna come out and play?

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.840
- Oh babe, thank you, but I can't.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.070
- Oh sure you can, Big Time.

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.850
Well, she's a lucky, lucky girl then.

01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:37.230
- Who?

01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:38.680
- You know who.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.640
Most guys don't give a shit

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.850
about their wives or
girlfriends that come in here.

01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:47.510
Well, since you're not
made, I'll take the lighter.

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.970
- [Lou] Hey, how do you
know I'm not single.

01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:55.780
- Because most single men
can't refuse my touch.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.380
You should go see her.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.220
Good guys like you
shouldn't be here anyway.

01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:01.163
- Hey, thanks.

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:09.370
It's about time I made a change
in my life, for the better.

01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:27.140
There she is.

01:24:28.899 --> 01:24:30.383
(sighs) A wave of relief hits me

01:24:30.383 --> 01:24:32.480
when she recognizes my mug.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.673
Oh man.

01:24:37.594 --> 01:24:39.620
- I didn't expect to see you here so soon.

01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:44.070
- Yeah, it's been a little hectic, sorry.

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:46.080
- Sorry.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.024
- It's okay, it's better
that I'm now here with you.

01:24:49.024 --> 01:24:51.362
- (chuckles) I thought
you were on the outs.

01:24:51.362 --> 01:24:55.460
- Yeah, that's a little complicated now.

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.888
- Complicated.

01:24:56.888 --> 01:24:57.721
- Well I mean.

01:24:58.738 --> 01:25:01.038
- Oh my god, like what
happened to your hands?

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:03.520
- It's a family ritual.

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.467
- [Wendy] It's more like demonic.

01:25:06.467 --> 01:25:07.580
- Oh no.

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:08.710
- Really, just cover it.

01:25:08.710 --> 01:25:09.770
I don't want to look at it.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:10.603
- Fine.

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:15.493
Thank you.

01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:19.650
- So you really enjoy working for the mob?

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.115
- Well...

01:25:22.115 --> 01:25:23.210
- You think I'm that stupid?

01:25:24.057 --> 01:25:25.360
- I mean I couldn't tell you.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.510
- You are, I mean the way
you guys walked around

01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:30.640
this place in your fancy
suits, the late nights,

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.100
and the owner seemed to only be scared

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.700
when the two of you were around.

01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:36.720
- He doesn't have anything
to be scared about.

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.560
He pays for protection.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.860
- Protection from what?

01:25:47.608 --> 01:25:49.709
What was that for?

01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:51.220
- For fixing my hand.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.140
Plus I like you, Wendy, a lot.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.720
I've been wanting to kiss
you since the waterfall.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.820
- Well why didn't you?

01:25:59.836 --> 01:26:01.350
- I don't know, I was scared.

01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:05.600
I've never met anyone like you,
plus you look sexy as hell.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.810
- I thought I'd find you here.

01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:09.240
- Not now, dickhead.

01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:14.042
If I throw a stick, will you leave?

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.520
- Why are you here,
you're missing all the fun

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.820
with the fam down at the nudy club.

01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:21.090
- [Lou] Don't you two
vampires have someone

01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:22.240
else's leg to hum?

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.050
- Ooh, better watch out
Charles, he's a wise guy now.

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.845
- Ooh, he's got me quaking in my boots.

01:26:28.845 --> 01:26:29.870
(agents laughing)

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:32.680
- [Lou] Look asshole, I've
had about enough of your...

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.400
- [Agent] Where the hell
did this gorilla come from?

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.280
- [Agent] Yeah actually
the zoo just called

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.690
and you're due back by nine.

01:26:42.695 --> 01:26:43.680
(upbeat music)

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.371
- Well who the fuck are you?

01:26:45.371 --> 01:26:48.130
We were having a conversation
here before you barged in.

01:26:48.130 --> 01:26:49.456
- I gotta go, Wendy.

01:26:49.456 --> 01:26:51.140
- Wait Lou, where are you going?

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:51.973
- I'm sorry.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.510
- [Agent] Yeah okay, well
nice talking to you drago.

01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:02.230
- They're on your ass now boy.

01:27:03.454 --> 01:27:04.700
(agents laughing)

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.160
Can I get two coffees over here?

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.210
- Normally a car ride somewhere

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:10.380
with two members of the family.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.630
I say I have a 95% chance of coming back.

01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:15.780
But with the feds there, it's 50/50.

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.280
You gotta go where you're
told when Degorgio asks.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.341
My mom and dad used to live in Pittsburgh.

01:28:56.341 --> 01:28:59.529
They had a house up in Troy Hill.

01:28:59.529 --> 01:29:03.107
Man, I wonder if it's even still standing.

01:29:03.107 --> 01:29:05.331
But a lot has changed since then,

01:29:05.331 --> 01:29:08.471
and a lot'll continue to change.

01:29:08.471 --> 01:29:11.804
The dismal tide that washes over us all.

01:29:40.199 --> 01:29:42.616
- [Paul] Immaculate isn't it?

01:29:46.749 --> 01:29:48.332
- Yes, it truly is.

01:29:52.468 --> 01:29:55.281
- I mean this could all be yours one day

01:29:55.281 --> 01:29:57.670
if things continue like
they are in New York.

01:29:57.670 --> 01:30:01.736
But for now you've got
Youngstown to deal with.

01:30:01.736 --> 01:30:03.783
- [Lou] What do you mean, sir?

01:30:03.783 --> 01:30:07.300
- I just got off the
phone with management,

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.449
and they're flying me in
to discuss the future.

01:30:09.449 --> 01:30:11.489
It's even necessary you take
charge before we lose it again

01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:13.489
for another few decades.

01:30:16.156 --> 01:30:18.608
- Well Mancini already
named his successor.

01:30:18.608 --> 01:30:21.691
- [Paul] Yeah, without our blessings.

01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:24.794
- [Lou] But how are we--

01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:27.380
- Okay, no need to concern
yourself with that, okay?

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.750
We want to be the first to let
you know, no more surprises.

01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:37.477
- Thank you Mr. Degorgio.

01:30:37.477 --> 01:30:39.770
- Don't be too thrilled, huh kid.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.150
- I am, just a shock.

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:50.810
Does Jeff know about this yet?

01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.780
- There's no need to concern
yourself with Jeff, okay?

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:58.020
He'll be asked to step
down, it's just politics.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:00.970
- But what if he doesn't?

01:31:02.496 --> 01:31:07.496
- (scoffs) Oh yeah, he will.

01:31:13.190 --> 01:31:15.280
- Mr. Degorgio, Jeff's my friend.

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.802
He's been my friend my entire life.

01:31:17.802 --> 01:31:21.570
- Louie, you need to
think about your future.

01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:24.400
Okay, every action has a consequence.

01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:27.550
Every wise guy knows this, every.

01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:34.230
Let's say that somebody was
to intervene in my plans,

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.950
well I might not be able to protect them

01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:39.410
or their loved ones.

01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:44.230
Now I don't like it, but it's
the cost of doing business.

01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:54.020
- Well you won't find me
standing in your way, sir.

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:58.670
- Good, why don't we go get a drink?

01:31:59.730 --> 01:32:02.120
I'd like to hash a couple
of things over with you.

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:04.373
- Okay.

01:32:09.645 --> 01:32:12.562
(soft jazzy music)

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:18.620
Then we usually take the case over to Vic,

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.630
he's the one that sends it on out.

01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:23.390
That's pretty much how Mancini
has us run collections.

01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:27.380
- I see, I'll have Marco here
swing by and pick you up,

01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.630
run you through the new process.

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:30.906
It's much more efficient.

01:32:30.906 --> 01:32:34.187
- Thank you.

01:32:34.187 --> 01:32:35.020
Ooh.

01:32:40.890 --> 01:32:45.810
- So, my sources tell me

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:49.680
that you've been having some trouble

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.720
with the feds around town lately.

01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:55.493
Is that true?

01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:02.490
- Well yeah, they are pretty persistent.

01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:07.190
But I haven't told 'em a thing.

01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:10.520
- Don't worry 'bout that,
you're third generation capos.

01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:15.450
Consider that situation taken care of.

01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:16.980
- We don't need somebody snooping around,

01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:20.190
sticking their big nose
where it don't belong.

01:33:20.190 --> 01:33:25.190
Especially the new boss in town.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.560
- [Lou] I noticed how the
feds were off putting.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:35.440
- In this case New York is
gonna make an exception.

01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:37.480
Hey Louie, let me ask you something.

01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:42.750
You got a girlfriend or a
fiance or something like that,

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.640
that I don't know about?

01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.400
I mean these things can be a distraction.

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.513
- No, sir.

01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:54.920
- Good, just checking.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:01.080
- Well you know, I mean nobody consistent.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.620
- [Marco] Yeah, I bet
you don't, lover boy.

01:34:05.825 --> 01:34:07.520
- Why don't you like the adults talk.

01:34:09.330 --> 01:34:12.346
It's best to keep your love
life out of this business.

01:34:12.346 --> 01:34:14.220
- [Marco] Yeah, you don't
wanna let the broads

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.720
get you all twisted up inside.

01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:22.123
Mr. Degorgio, sir with all due respect,

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.490
won't don't you tell Mr. Soreno here,

01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:25.820
why, why you didn't get married.

01:34:27.075 --> 01:34:30.230
(glass banging)

01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:31.780
- Was I fucking talking to you?

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:33.580
Was I talking to you?

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:34.413
- No, but I was talking--

01:34:34.413 --> 01:34:35.450
- Well then shut the fuck up.

01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:37.600
Go sit at the fucking
kids table right now.

01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:40.610
Stupid fucking idiot, get outta here.

01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:45.895
Hey Lou, you don't mind
if I call you Lou, do you?

01:34:45.895 --> 01:34:48.460
Let me tall you a little
something about the broads, okay?

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:52.000
You get involved with
'em, everything's good,

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.450
then next thing you know,

01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:55.460
they take you for
everything you fucking got.

01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:57.420
Everything, they leave you with nothing.

01:34:57.420 --> 01:34:58.920
And I've fucking seen it, I...

01:35:01.637 --> 01:35:06.637
(laughs) Yeah, I know, yeah.

01:35:08.184 --> 01:35:10.104
Lighten up kid, you'll
have your time in the sun

01:35:10.104 --> 01:35:15.104
with no pesky interruptions.

01:35:15.431 --> 01:35:20.431
- Thank you, Mr. Degorgio, thank you.

01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:24.206
- Sure thing kid.

01:35:24.206 --> 01:35:27.550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where you going?

01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:30.037
- I gotta hit the head.

01:35:30.037 --> 01:35:35.037
I'll be back, sir.

01:35:53.308 --> 01:35:58.308
- Fuck.

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:21.080
- [Valet] Yo, hey!

01:36:29.762 --> 01:36:32.345
(upbeat music)

01:36:35.603 --> 01:36:38.663
- [Jeff] I'm the fucking king
now, I'm the fucking boss.

01:36:38.663 --> 01:36:40.540
You're the boss, I'm the second boss.

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:43.457
(mancini laughing)

01:37:11.736 --> 01:37:14.569
(tires squealing)

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.073
- Where's Jeff?

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:23.533
You?

01:37:25.428 --> 01:37:27.450
- You're back, told you, you
couldn't resist my touch.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.216
- Don't flatter yourself, where's Jeff?

01:37:31.216 --> 01:37:33.200
- Listen, I'm paying for this, buddy.

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.890
- Jesus Louie, this a paying customer.

01:37:37.890 --> 01:37:38.723
- Fuck him.

01:37:39.610 --> 01:37:40.880
Where is he?

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.601
- I don't know, he left
with the older man,

01:37:42.601 --> 01:37:47.046
with the girl in the red dress.

01:37:47.046 --> 01:37:47.977
Hey, he said something about

01:37:47.977 --> 01:37:52.977
taking the party back to his place.

01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:10.492
- [Vito] It's good to be back
in our neck of the woods.

01:38:10.492 --> 01:38:12.590
- Surely, I'm exhausted.

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.790
- Not yet you're not.

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:19.680
In all seriousness you need
to go home to your wife.

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.090
- Flowers and chocolates
would be a nice touch.

01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:24.330
- Show here you care about her tonight.

01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:27.820
Fun and games are over,
Jeff, school's out.

01:38:51.818 --> 01:38:54.090
You'll find having a
strong woman beside you

01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:56.560
helps ease your mind, keep your cool,

01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:58.460
now more than ever.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.600
Now, go home and fuck your wife.

01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:07.500
It'll do you a lot of good.

01:39:13.194 --> 01:39:15.119
- What are you gonna do, Mr. Mancini?

01:39:15.119 --> 01:39:19.664
- Oh me, if she can
hear me coming already.

01:39:19.664 --> 01:39:21.570
(Vito groaning)

01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:23.898
(men laughing)

01:39:23.898 --> 01:39:25.499
- Have fun Mr. Mancini.

01:39:25.499 --> 01:39:27.249
Vito, have fun, Vito.

01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:31.300
- All right, see ya.

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.550
Well, where's my pussy?

01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:39.540
Where's my pussy?

01:40:20.008 --> 01:40:21.091
- [Lou] Fuck.

01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:31.822
- [Vito] You're not gonna take my wife.

01:40:31.822 --> 01:40:33.381
(gun banging)

01:40:33.381 --> 01:40:34.578
You son-of-a-bitch!

01:40:34.578 --> 01:40:35.504
(gun banging)

01:40:35.504 --> 01:40:38.184
- [Lou] Mr. Mancini, it's me Lou.

01:40:38.184 --> 01:40:39.031
- [Vito] Lou!

01:40:39.031 --> 01:40:40.914
- [Lou] Yeah!

01:40:40.914 --> 01:40:45.407
- [Vito] Help me get
Diane out, she been shot.

01:40:45.407 --> 01:40:48.407
Louie, come on, help me get her out.

01:40:49.529 --> 01:40:51.105
- [Lou] Oh fuck.

01:40:51.105 --> 01:40:52.090
- [Vito] She been shot.

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.650
Oh no, no, no, oh my poor sweet Diane.

01:41:01.006 --> 01:41:03.256
Oh, who did this, oh Diane.

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.813
- What happened?

01:41:08.283 --> 01:41:09.790
- That prick, Degorgio.

01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:11.690
He sent that fuck to finish us off.

01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.350
He wants control.

01:41:15.484 --> 01:41:17.240
- Come on, let me help you up.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240
- [Vito] No, no, no.

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.750
I'm pretty well bugged.

01:41:21.850 --> 01:41:22.980
- Mr. Mancini, don't say that.

01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:24.890
Come on, the ambulance is coming.

01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:27.980
- No don't fucking call
'em, don't call 'em.

01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.480
I don't deserve their respect.

01:41:30.346 --> 01:41:31.300
- What?

01:41:32.370 --> 01:41:35.350
- Louie, Louie there's
something I need to tell you.

01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.680
- [Louie] That can wait, come on.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.680
- No you need to know, you need to know.

01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:49.410
20 years ago, I followed orders
to have your dad taken out.

01:41:52.128 --> 01:41:53.860
(suspenseful music)

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:54.860
- What, no.

01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:02.540
So it's, it's true?

01:42:04.037 --> 01:42:05.020
- Yeah.
- No.

01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:11.720
- Your dad and I were friends, Lou.

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.500
He stepped on too many toes.

01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:21.230
I lived with that anguish
since that night, Lou.

01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:24.600
I tried to pay back what
I could and reconcile

01:42:26.082 --> 01:42:27.032
to you and your Ma.

01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:34.570
But a debt like that
could never be repaid.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:37.830
Forgive me, son.

01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:42.013
Forgive me.

01:42:45.009 --> 01:42:46.500
- Don't you fucking call me son.

01:42:48.188 --> 01:42:49.400
I fucking looked up to you.

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.480
- Do me one final justice.

01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:58.010
I can't live without Diane.

01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.940
No, I can't live without her.

01:43:02.970 --> 01:43:06.257
I want you to shoot me, shoot me Lou.

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.173
Do it!

01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:23.093
- No.

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.440
- Do it!

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.227
Do it, don't e a fucking
pussy like your father!

01:43:34.795 --> 01:43:36.610
- Fine!
(gun banging)

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:41.350
- Shit, shit, you shot
me in the fucking leg!

01:43:42.185 --> 01:43:43.310
- You wanted me to shoot you.

01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:45.135
- [Vito] Not in the fucking leg!

01:43:45.135 --> 01:43:47.021
- You worthless fucking coward.

01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:48.740
You motherfucker, if I would have shot you

01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:51.055
in that fucked up, corrupt brain of yours,

01:43:51.055 --> 01:43:52.126
you never would have been able to live

01:43:52.126 --> 01:43:55.913
for the fucked up shit
you don't to everybody.

01:43:55.913 --> 01:43:58.593
- Yeah, I gave you every reason.

01:43:58.593 --> 01:44:01.530
End me now, Lou.

01:44:01.530 --> 01:44:04.148
So why, Lou?

01:44:04.148 --> 01:44:09.148
Louie, Louie!

01:44:09.575 --> 01:44:14.225
Louie, please.

01:44:14.225 --> 01:44:17.182
Louie, Lou!

01:44:17.182 --> 01:44:19.932
(dramatic music)

01:44:40.706 --> 01:44:41.837
(sirens wailing)

01:44:41.837 --> 01:44:46.837
- [Louis] Oh fuck, Jeff, oh fuck.

01:45:18.925 --> 01:45:19.790
- [Jeff] How are you?

01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:22.060
- [Clerk] Good, so who's the lucky lady?

01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.760
- My wife, it's a surprise.

01:45:25.327 --> 01:45:27.250
What do you got here?

01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:29.000
- [Clerk] Um, how 'bout these ones?

01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:32.930
- If you say so, let me smell 'em.

01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:35.730
Ah, these are definitely to die for.

01:45:37.730 --> 01:45:40.580
You know what, keep the change.

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.320
- [Clerk] Thank you.

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.570
Good luck with your wife.

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.193
- Thank you.

01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.990
- [Clerk] Good night.

01:46:16.907 --> 01:46:19.657
(dramatic music)

01:46:24.657 --> 01:46:27.240
(Jeff humming)

01:46:51.047 --> 01:46:53.272
- [Maggie] It's about time you got home.

01:46:53.272 --> 01:46:54.560
- You must be feeling better honey bunny.

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.680
You're still up, eh.

01:46:56.970 --> 01:47:01.510
- Turns out, I'm not even sick, Daddy.

01:47:03.110 --> 01:47:05.710
- [Jeff] You're fucking kidding me.

01:47:05.710 --> 01:47:06.543
- No.

01:47:06.543 --> 01:47:08.214
- Oh my god!

01:47:08.214 --> 01:47:09.209
(gun banging)

01:47:09.209 --> 01:47:12.126
(Maggie screaming)

01:47:13.367 --> 01:47:15.867
(gun banging)

01:47:23.299 --> 01:47:25.966
(clock ticking)

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:36.915
- Maggie, call for help.

01:47:38.162 --> 01:47:40.478
It's all right, brother,
help is on the way.

01:47:40.478 --> 01:47:43.145
(Jeff coughing)

01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:45.550
- Widows and orphans.

01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:47.743
- [Louie] What?

01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:50.520
- [Jeff] Is that bullets.

01:47:53.128 --> 01:47:56.380
After you left, Lou, Vito said orphans.

01:48:01.890 --> 01:48:03.390
- Everything is gonna be okay.

01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:08.110
Don't you worry, you can't leave me now.

01:48:08.110 --> 01:48:10.230
You gotta be here for me and Timmy.

01:48:12.622 --> 01:48:14.433
- Timmy, Timmy, I like that.

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:27.470
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:31.460
Goddammit Jeffery, you're
a fighter, so fight!

01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:35.462
No! (sobbing)

01:48:35.462 --> 01:48:36.295
- Fuck.

01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:41.266
Maggie, I'm sorry.

01:48:41.266 --> 01:48:44.230
- Go, just go.

01:48:44.230 --> 01:48:46.980
(Maggie sobbing)

01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:56.000
- I remember in that moment,
not fully understanding

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.200
what Jeff meant, until all
the pieces came together.

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.760
Jeff, he was adding to
a long list of widows

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.960
and orphans that his
life leads in its wake.

01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:09.950
Him, me, even DeFrange's wife and kids.

01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:12.730
I mean hell, even the fathers that live,

01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:14.720
they're not really there.

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.913
That is when I knew, I had to get out.

01:49:17.867 --> 01:49:20.617
(sirens wailing)

01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:27.093
Hey.

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.440
- Hey, what happened to you?

01:49:32.372 --> 01:49:33.422
Do you wanna come in?

01:49:43.302 --> 01:49:45.210
- I hope it's okay, me
coming over like this.

01:49:45.210 --> 01:49:46.770
- Sure, I was up anyway.

01:49:46.770 --> 01:49:47.820
Can I get you a drink or something?

01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:48.653
- No, I'm okay.

01:49:53.203 --> 01:49:54.036
[Wendy] So...

01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:56.323
- So...

01:49:58.200 --> 01:49:59.900
- Do I have to drag it out of you?

01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:04.080
- I gotta call, I had to be somewhere.

01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:08.550
- [Wendy] Just leave at the drop of a hat.

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.040
- Yeah, seems so.

01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:20.170
They, uh, want me to
take over, in Youngstown.

01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:31.180
They fucking killed Jeff.

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.193
- What?
- Yeah.

01:50:35.088 --> 01:50:36.070
They put a hit on him.

01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:39.534
shot him right in front
of his fucking wife.

01:50:39.534 --> 01:50:40.600
- What?

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.780
- Hell, there's more.

01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:44.320
- No Lou, I don't wanna know more.

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.200
This is so crazy.

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.750
- I'm not who you think I am, Wendy.

01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:49.850
I'm not a good person.

01:50:51.090 --> 01:50:54.960
I've hurt a lot of people
for some bullshit cause.

01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:58.180
- It's not about what you've done okay,

01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:00.680
it matters who you are now.

01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:02.630
And you are a good person.

01:51:02.630 --> 01:51:04.500
I've always seen that in you.

01:51:05.490 --> 01:51:06.940
- [Louie] No, I'm really not.

01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:07.950
- Yes, you are.

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.151
- It's just, you don't--

01:51:11.151 --> 01:51:14.710
- I don't nothing, it's what
you want in this life now.

01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:17.260
That's what matters.

01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:18.260
- All I want is you.

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:20.520
- Of course you want me.

01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:24.660
- I remember once when I was a kid,

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:29.715
I was up in the loft of our
barn playing with my brother,

01:51:29.715 --> 01:51:30.548
it was just us.

01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:36.020
My dad was out by the lake
and he was fixing the fence.

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:39.640
I remember 'cause I took a breath

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.070
and I wanted to see the horses.

01:51:42.514 --> 01:51:45.610
I saw my mom taking a
drink, she sat it down,

01:51:47.155 --> 01:51:47.988
and he just grabbed her by the waist

01:51:47.988 --> 01:51:49.580
and lifted her up and kissed her.

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.260
They went sat by the water
and they were just so happy.

01:51:59.210 --> 01:52:00.410
Not a care in the world.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:07.420
I was thinking, that's exactly how I feel

01:52:08.490 --> 01:52:09.390
when I'm with you.

01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:11.263
- [Wendy] Really?

01:52:11.263 --> 01:52:14.910
- Yeah, all this bad shit
that keeps happening,

01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:18.623
I don't care about any
of it when I'm with you.

01:52:25.774 --> 01:52:27.027
- [Wendy] I'm really sorry.

01:52:27.027 --> 01:52:28.928
- For what?

01:52:28.928 --> 01:52:31.678
(dramatic music)

01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:17.488
- [Wendy] What were you
thinking about just now?

01:53:17.488 --> 01:53:18.672
- [Louie] Run away with me, Wendy.

01:53:18.672 --> 01:53:19.649
- (chuckles) What, where?

01:53:19.649 --> 01:53:22.420
- I'm serious, we can go right now.

01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:24.460
- You're crazy, Lou.

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.710
- We could start a new life together.

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:30.250
Just you, me, my mom.

01:53:30.250 --> 01:53:32.510
- Oh my gosh, your mom, I
haven't even met her yet.

01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:33.620
- Well I can't just leave her.

01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:34.870
We can remedy that today.

01:53:36.161 --> 01:53:38.199
- What about my horses?

01:53:38.199 --> 01:53:39.145
- They could come too.

01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:40.090
- (laughs) Really?

01:53:40.090 --> 01:53:40.923
- Yeah.

01:53:42.623 --> 01:53:43.456
- Okay.

01:53:44.295 --> 01:53:45.441
- Okay, what?

01:53:45.441 --> 01:53:46.680
- All right, let's do it.

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:47.580
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:53:49.224 --> 01:53:50.990
- All right, you're not gonna regret this.

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.840
- I'm sure I won't.

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.510
- What's that supposed to mean.

01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:58.481
- What do you mean, what's
that supposed to mean?

01:53:58.481 --> 01:54:01.231
(dramatic music)

01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:06.330
- You sure you wanna do this?

01:54:06.330 --> 01:54:07.580
- Of course.

01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:09.560
- Okay, I'm just warning you,

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.670
she can be a little abrasive at times.

01:54:11.670 --> 01:54:16.670
- Yeah, I think I can manage. (laughs)

01:54:27.431 --> 01:54:28.335
- [Louie] You excited?

01:54:28.335 --> 01:54:29.585
- [Wendy] Yeah.

01:54:32.359 --> 01:54:34.470
- I feel like a captain abandoning ship,

01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:36.410
leaving my best friend here to die.

01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:39.900
The way I see it, there's only two roads

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.950
out of this godforsaken town.

01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:45.160
One towards Paul Degorgio and the other,

01:54:47.215 --> 01:54:50.885
where she's right by my side.

01:54:50.885 --> 01:54:54.380
You take your pick.

01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:56.814
Last chance.

01:54:56.814 --> 01:54:58.300
(both laughing)

01:54:58.300 --> 01:54:59.340
- Where the hell have you been?

01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:00.960
The cops have kept me up all night

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.583
with flashing lights and
did you hear about Jeff?

01:55:03.583 --> 01:55:08.570
Oh, (laughs) well I didn't
know you brought home a stray.

01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:09.920
Are you gonna introduce me?

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.550
It isn't often we get some company coming.

01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:15.470
- Mom, this is Wendy.

01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:16.350
- Pleasure.

01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:18.100
- Oh, well the pleasure's all mine.

01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:19.890
Believe me, please come in.

01:55:19.890 --> 01:55:20.980
- Thank you.

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:23.050
- Straight back this way.

01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:24.930
- Wow, your place is really nice.

01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:25.763
- Aww, thanks.

01:55:26.725 --> 01:55:27.558
We're gonna have to talk later.

01:55:27.558 --> 01:55:28.391
- Okay.

01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:32.460
- It isn't often Louis brings
somebody home for a visit.

01:55:37.494 --> 01:55:38.327
- [Wendy] You mind if I use your bathroom?

01:55:38.327 --> 01:55:39.780
- Oh sure, it's just down the hall,

01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:41.276
first door on the left.

01:55:41.276 --> 01:55:44.750
- Left.

01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:47.420
- So Lou, what's really going on here?

01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:49.850
I mean it's not like I don't mind a visit

01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:52.080
from my son and his girlfriend.

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.730
- Mom, after everything
that's been going on

01:55:56.730 --> 01:56:00.280
in the past few days, I can't stay.

01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:03.900
I can't keep living this
life that's not my own.

01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:06.150
- [Mom] I'm so glad you realize that.

01:56:07.130 --> 01:56:08.495
- Wendy and I, we decided to get out now.

01:56:08.495 --> 01:56:09.990
And while we still can.

01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:13.300
I want you to come with us.

01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:16.820
- You think it's just a
fucking fairy tale ending?

01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:22.280
- But Dad always wanted us to get out.

01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.640
- Dad wanted you alive, Louis, alive.

01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:29.410
- Mom, I am alive, right now!

01:56:32.530 --> 01:56:35.470
- I'm not sure what he's
told you about what he does

01:56:35.470 --> 01:56:40.383
or did, but 24 hours ago

01:56:41.230 --> 01:56:43.170
he swore a fucking blood oath

01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:46.690
to those fucking vampires.

01:56:46.690 --> 01:56:48.250
- Mom, it's going away--

01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:52.860
- Mom nothing, do you think
they're gonna forget about you?

01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:53.693
- I can't keep working

01:56:53.693 --> 01:56:55.410
for that fucking murderous psychopath.

01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:59.020
- No, and I don't want you to either.

01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:04.020
But, I don't know what
to do, I really don't.

01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:06.000
But I know that if you run,

01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:12.070
you'll never be safe from the
family or the cops. (sighs)

01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:18.860
- Well then, will you still

01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.040
just come with us for a few days?

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:22.290
Let everything blow over.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.390
It'll give me time to come
up with some kind of a plan.

01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:33.720
- Okay, sure, sure.

01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:38.170
There's nothing I wouldn't
do for my little boy.

01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:43.180
But, we better get going.

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:47.150
It's already dark and they're probably

01:57:47.150 --> 01:57:49.740
coming for you sooner, rather than later.

01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:50.573
- [Louie] Well.

01:57:50.573 --> 01:57:53.500
- I just have to get my things around.

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.420
So you think you can go to the attic

01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.250
and grab me a suitcase?

01:57:57.250 --> 01:57:58.083
- [Louie] Yeah sure, Ma.

01:57:58.083 --> 01:57:58.916
- Okay great.

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.830
It should be up there somewhere honey,

01:58:14.830 --> 01:58:16.540
I haven't been up there in ages.

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:28.510
(dramatic music)

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:36.490
- [Wendy] Do you need any help, Lou?

01:58:36.490 --> 01:58:39.340
- No, I've got 'em.

01:58:42.150 --> 01:58:42.983
Coming down now.

01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:52.904
- [Ma] You know we
should get some supplies

01:58:52.904 --> 01:58:56.122
before we head out.

01:58:56.122 --> 01:58:58.955
(Wendy murmuring)

01:59:06.451 --> 01:59:07.951
- Maybe this one, ooh so sexy.

01:59:22.156 --> 01:59:24.573
(Ma sighing)

02:00:30.309 --> 02:00:31.659
- Where else do you wanna go?

02:00:31.659 --> 02:00:35.748
- Uh, I've always been
particular on a beach.

02:00:35.748 --> 02:00:38.111
Especially since I've only
seen it on TV when I was a kid.

02:00:38.111 --> 02:00:40.020
- [Wendy] So how do you
know you'll like it?

02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:42.693
- [Louie] Because I get to see
you in a bikini all the time.

02:00:42.693 --> 02:00:44.450
- (laughs) Check things out.

02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:46.082
- [Louie] Yeah.

02:00:46.082 --> 02:00:48.286
Anything to get you outta those clothes.

02:00:48.286 --> 02:00:51.119
(Wendy chuckling)

02:01:00.382 --> 02:01:01.215
- [Louie] Here, for you.

02:01:01.215 --> 02:01:02.590
- [Wendy] Thank you.

02:01:02.590 --> 02:01:03.670
- [Louie] Mom, we're back.

02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:10.520
- [Wendy] Oh my god, Lou.

02:01:14.144 --> 02:01:19.144
- [Louie] Mom, no Mom!

02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:44.960
- Tell me you did it.

02:01:50.453 --> 02:01:52.453
Get the fuck outta here.

02:01:55.333 --> 02:01:58.290
(sighs) I would have
killed to see the look

02:01:58.290 --> 02:02:01.792
on the cocksucker Mancini's
face when it went down.

02:02:01.792 --> 02:02:03.690
(laughs)

02:02:03.690 --> 02:02:04.990
That's the price of power.

02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:07.720
I gotta miss out on all the fun.

02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:24.083
This is for you, that's
yours, you've earned it.

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:31.730
Oh, and I sweetened the deal a little bit

02:02:31.730 --> 02:02:34.580
for taking care of the
suits and Mrs. Soreno.

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.850
Yeah, I know how you
feel about the contracts

02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:40.620
involving broads, but can't
have her pulling Louie

02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:42.880
out of operations, can't have it.

02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:48.580
A woman's work is never done.

02:02:50.683 --> 02:02:53.210
(laughs) But in her case, I'd say it is.

02:02:59.905 --> 02:03:00.738
Oh my god.

02:03:02.598 --> 02:03:06.130
You don't have a problem with that, right?

02:03:06.130 --> 02:03:07.990
Rob, you don't have a problem here right?

02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:16.040
Good, let's consider this
contract closed then.

02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:20.510
I got a plane picking me up

02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:22.050
to go to Long Island in two hours.

02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:35.200
Oh Rob, I got a couple more
gifts for you out by the pool.

02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:38.970
(dramatic music)

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:08.040
- Lucky bastard, huh?

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:10.880
- Yep, he show the fuck is.

02:05:37.108 --> 02:05:40.608
- [Wendy] Louie, we have to call somebody.

02:05:41.786 --> 02:05:42.619
- Who?

02:05:44.261 --> 02:05:46.580
- [Wendy] I don't know, a priest,

02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:48.470
the fucking cops, an ambulance.

02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:52.590
- We do that and we're both dead.

02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:58.690
Well we are, they own the fucking cops.

02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:02.690
They own everything in this fucking town.

02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.080
- [Wendy] We can't leave her here.

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:06.190
- No fucking shit!

02:06:11.428 --> 02:06:12.443
I'm sorry, I just...

02:06:28.730 --> 02:06:30.060
Can you hand me that towel?

02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:53.680
Stay here, I'll be right back.

02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:03.840
You bet your ass.

02:07:19.312 --> 02:07:21.157
- You're not gonna tell me
what you're doing, are you?

02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:23.500
- Call this number.

02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:31.750
- FBI, that's it, you're
not even a goodbye?

02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.270
You're just like my father.

02:07:36.065 --> 02:07:37.660
- What do you want me to say, Wendy?

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:38.493
That I'm sorry?

02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:42.820
Okay, I'm fucking sorry
for getting you involved.

02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:44.960
- You're a fucking asshole!

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:45.793
Fuck you.

02:07:52.428 --> 02:07:55.670
- You want me to tell you that I'm scared?

02:07:55.670 --> 02:07:59.130
I'm scared, but what do
you do with the dead?

02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:04.170
You bury 'em, that's it, you move on.

02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:10.480
But if I come back and I
walk through that door,

02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:12.430
you'll know that
everything's gonna be okay.

02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:20.450
I've only got one chance
at keeping us safe.

02:08:23.582 --> 02:08:26.860
(Wendy sobbing)

02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:31.860
If not, well then say goodbye.

02:08:33.424 --> 02:08:35.210
- No, no.(sobbing)

02:08:37.755 --> 02:08:40.205
- At least know one thing,
I've always loved you.

02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:50.750
Okay, every since the
first time in the diner.

02:08:54.303 --> 02:08:55.290
A lot's changed in our lives,

02:08:55.290 --> 02:08:58.160
but the greatest thing's been you.

02:08:59.211 --> 02:09:00.100
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:08.800
- I'm so scared, I don't know what to do.

02:09:16.581 --> 02:09:17.414
I love you.

02:09:17.414 --> 02:09:22.360
- Hey, hey, hey,
everything's gonna be okay.

02:09:23.707 --> 02:09:28.707
Okay, I promise.

02:09:35.204 --> 02:09:36.037
Call.

02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:54.697
(phone ringing)

02:09:55.985 --> 02:09:59.760
- [Charles] Charles
Finley, FBI, who's calling?

02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:00.661
Hello?

02:10:00.661 --> 02:10:03.661
- Um, this is gonna sound crazy, um.

02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:07.890
- I've been pushed, now
I have to push back.

02:10:09.004 --> 02:10:12.000
Now I'll know this'll
probably be a one-way trip,

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.200
but I've gotta end this once and for all.

02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:21.480
- Excuse me, Mr. Degorgio.

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:27.510
Your car's ready and your
plane's being fueled as we speak.

02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:30.280
- Good, thank you Marco, I'll
meet you right out there.

02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:32.430
I gotta take care of a
couple things right here.

02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:36.680
- [Marco] Yes, sir.

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:38.720
- Eh, you can never be too careful, huh.

02:11:04.479 --> 02:11:07.062
(man grunting)

02:11:43.697 --> 02:11:44.530
- I want to talk to you

02:11:44.530 --> 02:11:45.930
about that situation the other night.

02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:46.940
- That situation.

02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:49.070
- Yeah, a fucking mess.

02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:50.340
- Mess indeed.

02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:55.320
- It's bad for business
Marco, which got me thinking.

02:11:57.060 --> 02:11:59.140
Maybe next time I send you to do the job

02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:01.852
instead of contracting out to some joker.

02:12:01.852 --> 02:12:05.170
- Really? (speaking in foreign language)

02:12:05.170 --> 02:12:09.840
Mr. Degorgio, I'd be honored, sir.

02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:14.260
- Ah, (speaking in foreign
language), I bet you would.

02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:16.380
You know where have all the real men gone?

02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:18.910
We've raised such a pussy generation.

02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:20.890
I gotta contract out every single time

02:12:20.890 --> 02:12:24.040
for a new set of balls
and it's wearing me thin.

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:27.450
But, I got a good feeling about tonight,

02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:28.720
Marco, I got a good feeling.

02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:30.345
- Yeah, me too.

02:12:30.345 --> 02:12:32.240
(upbeat music)

02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.590
- Catch the Fires game last night?

02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:34.440
- [Gangster] Yeah, how 'bout that turn

02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:35.930
from right field to third?

02:12:35.930 --> 02:12:36.780
- Beautiful.

02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:37.977
- I'ma go check the south gate.

I'm gonna get that

You're not gonna catch him now anyway.

02:22:20.190 --> 02:22:21.690
I can't just let him get away.

02:22:23.970 --> 02:22:27.480
He fucking killed my

02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:30.850
My only friend.

02:22:37.130 --> 02:22:42.130
My father was right, once they
sink their talons into you,

02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:51.140
oh fuck, I wish I could
see him one more time.

02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:54.930
So I could see how disappointed he is.

02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:02.477
This place is like a lead
veil, suffocating you,

02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:05.410
keeping you on the arm.

02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:11.530
No one's safe, and it can't stay that way.

02:23:13.930 --> 02:23:15.730
- It's up to you how this end's pal.

02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:20.270
Do the smart thing here,
we'll bring him down together.

02:23:36.296 --> 02:23:37.960
He killed my friend too.

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:41.020
He's not gonna get away
with it, if you help us.

02:23:44.310 --> 02:23:45.910
- I'll do whatever I have to do.

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:50.590
Let's pull the whole
fucking steel curtain back.

02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:54.920
- Good, I will.

02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:00.320
So, Wendy seemed nice.

02:24:01.941 --> 02:24:03.920
I didn't see her falling
for somebody like you,

02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:08.920
but it didn't turn out half-bad.

02:24:09.956 --> 02:24:12.450
(Louie grunting)

02:24:12.450 --> 02:24:15.490
Oh, call an ambulance,
he's bleeding pretty bad.

02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:17.690
You better hang your ass in there

02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:20.520
if you wanna bring down
Degorgio and the rest of 'em.

02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:23.060
- Fuck off, get me up.

02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:25.411
- Here I thought you were
gonna puss out on me.

02:24:25.411 --> 02:24:27.022
- (laughs) Fuck you.

02:24:27.022 --> 02:24:28.180
(men laughing)

02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:29.180
- That's the spirit.

02:24:31.427 --> 02:24:33.377
Come on, let's go get Rambo patched up.

02:24:34.866 --> 02:24:37.533
(upbeat music)

02:24:55.258 --> 02:24:58.120
- The next few months,
things around town changed.

02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:00.700
After I got out of the hospital,
I spend most of my time

02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:02.960
in and out of witness protection

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.160
and testifying in court.

02:25:09.679 --> 02:25:12.450
I've never seen so many
pissed off people in my life.

02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:17.670
All in all, I single handedly brought down

02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:19.820
two of the largest kingpins of our time,

02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:22.080
Mancini and Degorgio.

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.600
Plus about 14 others,

02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:24.840
but what did that get me?

02:25:26.270 --> 02:25:29.610
Four years in the federal
pen, for what you ask?

02:25:29.610 --> 02:25:33.092
Well, illegally possessing
an automatic firearm.

02:25:33.092 --> 02:25:34.680
My dad's Tommy gun.

02:25:37.397 --> 02:25:40.241
(man laughing)

02:25:40.241 --> 02:25:42.190
And a whole slew of other
gun charge bullshit.

02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:43.940
The fucking judge, he was no saint.

02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:49.260
But, I guess it was a lot more
than Wendy could bargain for.

02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:51.720
After only a few months,
she stopped visiting.

02:26:30.740 --> 02:26:32.720
So now you're probably asking yourself,

02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:35.220
is he really sorry for
everything that he's done?

02:26:35.220 --> 02:26:37.450
Did I repay my debt to society?

02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:40.660
I mean, I'm a bad guy right?

02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:42.160
At least in your eyes anyways.

02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:46.490
I killed, stole, lied,
and cheated for the mob,

02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:50.940
not to mention I lost
my dad, mom, brother,

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:53.170
hell even my best friend.

02:26:54.090 --> 02:26:58.020
But, hi mamacita.

02:27:05.801 --> 02:27:09.218
So, the answer's pretty simple, fuck you,

02:27:11.658 --> 02:27:13.091
how 'bout that?

02:27:13.091 --> 02:27:15.674
(upbeat music)

02:28:56.723 --> 02:28:59.306
(upbeat music)

02:31:04.803 --> 02:31:07.211
(horn honking)

02:31:07.211 --> 02:31:10.378
(movie reel clicking)
