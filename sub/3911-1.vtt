Previously on
 "Tyrant"

00:09.650 --> 00:11.430
It's Barry, Bassam.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.570
I'm coming...
for my nephew's wedding.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.840
It's not just me, you know.
Dad doesn't want to go either.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.910
Why do you think
he hasn't been back in 20 years?

00:17.910 --> 00:19.360
Little brother.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.490
Jamal.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.610
[Jamal] The wedding night is very special.
[fireworks popping and whistling]

00:22.610 --> 00:24.530
It would break
Ahmed's heart

00:24.530 --> 00:27.800
if the woman
he married wasn't pure.

00:29.140 --> 00:30.720
There it is.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.030
[gunshots]
[rubble clattering]

00:32.030 --> 00:33.450
I'm beginning
to think he's insane.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.410
I'm here as a man
and a servant of Allah.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.050
Did anyone appoint me?

00:38.060 --> 00:40.700
Protests like these need
to be strangled in their crib.

00:40.710 --> 00:42.960
Peaceful demonstration
is a basic human right.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.220
I am the true voice of Abbudin,

00:45.220 --> 00:47.150
not this terrorist, Ihab Rashid.

00:47.150 --> 00:49.820
So you want to have a coup,
oust your own brother?

00:49.820 --> 00:51.750
There will be
no peace in Abbudin

00:51.750 --> 00:52.800
with my brother in power.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.520
He has to be removed.

00:54.530 --> 00:56.520
For the sake
of our family, us,

00:56.520 --> 00:59.610
I'm asking you
to come home with us.

01:00.330 --> 01:02.070
Don't expect us to come back.

01:02.070 --> 01:03.290
I'm sorry, Jamal.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.220
I didn't want it to be this way.

01:05.950 --> 01:09.120
We both need
to pick our friends better.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.520
General, you may arrest
your prisoner.

01:11.530 --> 01:14.890
Jamal will rule this country
for the rest of his life.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.280
Men in prison get out of prison.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.060
As long as he's alive,
you're not safe.

01:20.060 --> 01:22.770
I will sentence
my brother to death.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.350
If you don't want
to show him mercy,

01:24.350 --> 01:25.860
show mercy to me.

01:29.860 --> 01:31.860
[paint can ball clattering]

01:31.860 --> 01:34.860

[spraying continues]

01:50.860 --> 01:52.860
[bicycle brakes squeaking]

01:59.470 --> 02:01.950
Hurry.
We'll be late to the Palace.

02:24.250 --> 02:27.950
[cell door rolls, slams]
[sound echoes]

02:38.230 --> 02:40.360
Knight to queen's bishop 3.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.360
[pawn thuds]

02:43.360 --> 02:45.360
[chair creaks]

02:49.240 --> 02:50.280
What?

02:50.740 --> 02:52.030
It's my move.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.410
I'm done playing, Jamal.

02:56.540 --> 02:57.760
Well, I'm not.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.840
Knight to queen's bishop 3.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.090
You look thin.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.360
Yeah, well, my, um...

03:07.650 --> 03:09.910
my appetite's
not what it used to be.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.250
Just let me see Molly.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.810
I'll bring you some cookies,

03:16.810 --> 03:18.350
the pecan ones you like

03:18.350 --> 03:21.080
from the baker
next to the Grey Mosque.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.500
Gift-wrapped apologies?

03:24.140 --> 03:26.710
You think
I'm apologizing to you?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.790
Why would I apologize to you?

03:31.670 --> 03:32.920
I'm waiting for you

03:32.920 --> 03:34.770
to say "Sorry."

03:35.360 --> 03:36.710
Just once.

03:44.450 --> 03:45.400
I'm sorry.

03:46.810 --> 03:47.770
I am.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.450
I'm sorry I put us
in this position.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.440
[scoffs]

04:00.440 --> 04:02.420
That's not what I meant.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.550
Jamal...

04:04.550 --> 04:06.110
I did what I had to do.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.560
Now, please...

04:09.530 --> 04:10.510
please...

04:12.520 --> 04:14.030
do what you have to do.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.959
You can't force me to move.

04:23.410 --> 04:25.420
I have the upper hand.

04:25.760 --> 04:29.340
I could keep you in here,
my prisoner,

04:29.730 --> 04:32.010
for the rest of your life.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.280
Knight to queen's bishop 3.

[pictures flapping]

06:00.410 --> 06:02.260
Faster than
we can cover them.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.890
Not just Ma'an,
but here in Asima.

06:05.980 --> 06:07.430
Even behind bars,

06:07.430 --> 06:10.860
Bassam is galvanizing
the students and the liberals.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.140
Not all of them.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.450
I've been working with students,
hundreds of them,

06:15.660 --> 06:17.900
who want a
unified and peaceful Abbudin.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.560
Who tell you what you want
to hear because they fear you.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.070
Your cynicism is
an occupational hazard.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.500
These are just a few
troublemakers and idealists.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.640
A few?

06:29.410 --> 06:30.940
Almost a million

06:31.280 --> 06:35.640
tweets and social media
postings calling to free Bassam.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.440
And these are just
from the last three days.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.880
Shut down the service.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.320
It isn't the service
that needs shutting down.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.650
It's been three weeks

06:45.650 --> 06:48.900
since the trial court
pronounced the death sentence.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.860
What's Jamal waiting for?

06:53.220 --> 06:55.050
He won't talk about it.

06:56.420 --> 06:57.580
Not even to you?

06:57.580 --> 06:59.580
[breaths deeply]

06:59.850 --> 07:01.810
Has Jamal lost his nerve?

07:04.300 --> 07:04.850
It's raising questions.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.280
I understand.

07:10.390 --> 07:14.510
Alive, Bassam gives
the people hope.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.430
Dead, he'd be forgotten.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.660
And your husband would be free from his brother's living ghost.

07:24.480 --> 07:28.720
It's time to show the world
that Abbudin is open for business.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.180
With our new friends
from China,

07:32.550 --> 07:34.720
we will develop these fields.
[man speaks in distance]

07:34.720 --> 07:35.980
[man speaks in distance]

07:35.980 --> 07:39.980
Thousands of jobs will be created
for the people of Ma'an.

And they will have you to thank.

07:42.820 --> 07:45.330
[man speaks in distance]

07:45.330 --> 07:46.030
Me?

07:46.030 --> 07:49.100
I'm appointing you
Minister of Energy Development,

07:49.100 --> 07:50.460
effective immediately.

07:50.460 --> 07:51.580
What do you say?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.580
I don't know anything
about the oil business.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.100
You will learn.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.800
We will learn together.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.220
The thing is I've been talking
to some investors from Dubai

08:03.220 --> 08:05.060
about opening a boutique hotel.

08:05.790 --> 08:07.490
The site that
we're looking at is in London,

08:07.490 --> 08:11.050
so I... I would have
to relocate.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.860
[man speaks in distance]

08:12.860 --> 08:15.920
Why would you move
to a place without sun?

08:16.310 --> 08:17.820
I don't mind the rain.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.080
And the people, [scoffs]

08:21.520 --> 08:23.880
their skin
looks like cheese.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.410
It's a good opportunity.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.250
I can show you the business plan
as soon as we're finished.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.289
Son, I give you the chance

08:32.289 --> 08:35.010
to bring Abbudin
into the 21st century,

08:35.010 --> 08:38.340
and you want to open
a boutique hotel in London.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.480
You tell your friends from Dubai

08:40.480 --> 08:43.840
to find another partner
who's name isn't Al Fayeed.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.840

08:47.840 --> 08:49.840
[birds chirping]

08:50.420 --> 08:55.400
[reporter] Here we found artifacts from over 4,000 years ago of a vibrant trade.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.520
So not only
has Abbudin been at the crossroads

08:57.520 --> 08:59.620
of the world's
economy for millennia,

08:59.620 --> 09:02.140
it is also the source
of an ancient culture

09:02.140 --> 09:04.800
shared by all of us
who call Abbudin home.

09:04.850 --> 09:07.850
[speaks Arabic]

09:08.850 --> 09:10.810
Halima Nair made that film

09:10.810 --> 09:13.150
to introduce our cultural treasures

09:13.150 --> 09:15.090
to your great nation.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.200
Like Halima, these students
all hail from Ma'an.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.280
As First Lady,
I've enlisted them

09:20.290 --> 09:23.930
to serve as ambassadors
of the president's vision

09:23.930 --> 09:25.960
for the future of Abbudin.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.520
This is just a sample of
the artifacts they've excavated,

09:29.520 --> 09:32.790
which will be exhibited
next year at the Louvre.

09:32.790 --> 09:36.630
Please, feel free to ask
the students any questions you have.

09:36.630 --> 09:39.390
[speaking Chinese]

09:39.390 --> 09:41.710
Your soldiers have been
targeted by a series

09:41.710 --> 09:43.950
of terrorist attacks in Ma'an.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.510
Aren't you worried that
the insurgency will undermine

09:47.510 --> 09:49.500
these lofty plans?

09:52.570 --> 09:54.500
Our hearts are heavy with the pain

09:54.510 --> 09:56.870
for the loss of our brave soldiers,

09:58.540 --> 10:02.190
but we will not allow
a few troublemakers,

10:02.450 --> 10:06.380
enemies of peace,
to stand in the way of our dream

10:06.460 --> 10:09.350
for a united and peaceful Abbudin.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.650
[nails rattling]

10:15.770 --> 10:18.140
Next time, let's find
someone closer to my size.

10:20.210 --> 10:21.830
Musa, cover the bomb.

10:26.090 --> 10:29.190
Malik, this arms
the trigger, okay?

10:29.190 --> 10:31.190
[traffic noise in distance]

10:33.620 --> 10:35.020
Don't worry, Coach.

10:36.180 --> 10:37.310
I'll see you soon.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.830
Okay, let's go.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.060
Everyone take different routes
back to the safe house.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.000
Yes.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.130
Hello.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.500
Yes, Uncle.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.210
How many?

12:04.370 --> 12:06.370
[exales deeply]

12:06.370 --> 12:07.470
I'm here.

12:07.590 --> 12:09.130
Convene the council.

12:09.130 --> 12:11.130
[phone beeps]

12:12.620 --> 12:16.560
One of Rashid's men
just killed seven of my soldiers.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.380
The week before,
he killed a dozen.

12:18.380 --> 12:21.760
You should be ordering me
to clear Ma'an street by street

12:21.760 --> 12:23.120
instead of tying my hands.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.890
Ahmed, did you hear me
tell my uncle

12:24.890 --> 12:27.230
not to retaliate?

12:29.610 --> 12:30.240
No.

12:30.240 --> 12:33.760
All I said was
respond proportionately.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.630
Avoid civilian targets.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.650
There are no civilian targets
in Ma'an.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.370
Not as long as
they keep giving sanctuary to Rashid.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.390
Colonel Mahmoud, how much

12:43.390 --> 12:47.150
of Ma'an is still actively
supporting the insurgency?

12:47.160 --> 12:50.600
Well, our most recent
intelligence, uh, estimate

12:50.600 --> 12:52.420
is running at ten percent.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.000
And last month?

12:54.280 --> 12:56.350
It was twice that,
Mr. Pr. President.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.600
We are going in the right direction.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.140
But you will never win.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.730
Look at Syria.

13:02.670 --> 13:03.850
In ten years from now,

13:03.850 --> 13:05.960
with foreign investment gone
because of the risk

13:05.960 --> 13:07.430
and thousands dead,

13:07.750 --> 13:10.950
you'll be asking me
why we didn't end this today,

13:11.240 --> 13:12.450
once and for all.

13:12.910 --> 13:15.570
What exactly
do you want me to do?

13:18.010 --> 13:20.500
Our intelligence has identified

13:20.500 --> 13:22.880
Al-Jafar as the base
of Ihab's support.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.780
I know the problem.

13:23.780 --> 13:25.570
What is the solution?

13:28.080 --> 13:32.110
A limited chemical attack
on that neighborhood

13:32.290 --> 13:34.680
would break the back
of the insurgency.

13:41.990 --> 13:43.560
My office, Uncle.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.390
Ahmed will brief you
about the groundbreaking.

14:01.390 --> 14:03.990
[hinges creaking]
[door slams]

14:06.490 --> 14:08.490
[sighs]

14:09.100 --> 14:10.140
Uncle...

14:11.970 --> 14:13.210
I won't be a pariah

14:13.210 --> 14:14.470
or a criminal.

14:15.390 --> 14:20.100
I want those stocks of gas
destroyed immediately.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.060
Colonel Mahmoud

14:23.060 --> 14:24.870
has assets inside Ma'an.

14:24.870 --> 14:27.020
He'll find you a target.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.180
And I don't mean civilians.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.460
Yes, Mr. President.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.700
You would never have dared
say those things

14:36.710 --> 14:38.260
in front of my brother.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.900
Even though he's not here,

14:43.840 --> 14:47.820
I keep his voice inside my head
for safekeeping.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.300
Yes, Mr. President.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.300
[door opens]

14:57.300 --> 15:00.300
[hinges creaking]
[door closes]

15:04.400 --> 15:07.400
[indistinct chatter in background]

15:07.400 --> 15:09.400
[chair rolling]

15:14.520 --> 15:15.730
What's going on over there?

15:15.730 --> 15:18.230
The Chinese
are taking over our old embassy.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.560
I just miss you guys.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.830
I miss you, too.

15:26.980 --> 15:28.640
Are you writing your father?

15:28.640 --> 15:30.210
Yup. Every day.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.260
What are you saying?

15:34.070 --> 15:37.900
Uh, that I understand
why he did what he did,

15:37.900 --> 15:40.880
and that I'm proud of him
no matter what happens.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.000
Sammy...

15:45.000 --> 15:45.860
What?

15:46.100 --> 15:48.090
I'm saying exactly
what you tell me to say.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.900
Not that it matters
'cause he's probably

15:49.900 --> 15:51.680
not getting them
anyway, so I...

15:55.620 --> 15:56.970
Honey, I got to go.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.720
Listen to me.

15:58.720 --> 16:02.060
Our job is
to never give up hope.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.990
Sammy?

16:05.490 --> 16:06.730
Yup, I know.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.760
I'll call you back after
Emma gets home, okay?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.030
I love you.

16:12.470 --> 16:13.890
I love you, too, Mom.

16:15.890 --> 16:17.890
[clicks button]
[repeated beeping]

16:17.890 --> 16:19.890
[inhales deeply]

16:21.010 --> 16:22.020
Nothing.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.220
They won't budge, and I'm not
welcome back there anymore.

16:26.220 --> 16:27.260
[cover display thuds]

16:27.260 --> 16:29.260
I spoke to a lawyer from
Amnesty this afternoon.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.650
They're circulating
a petition on Barry's behalf.

16:31.650 --> 16:34.750
Ten Nobel Peace Prize
winners have already signed.

16:34.810 --> 16:36.390
Uh, I'm waiting to hear back

16:36.390 --> 16:38.460
from the woman at the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights.

16:38.460 --> 16:39.430
Oh, and I wrote a letter

16:39.430 --> 16:41.170
to the Canadian ambassador...

16:41.170 --> 16:43.170
[paper rustles]

16:43.280 --> 16:45.110
What?
You think this is useless?

16:45.540 --> 16:48.160
No. You're right
to keep pushing.

16:48.410 --> 16:49.050
You must never...

16:49.050 --> 16:50.610
Never give up hope.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.210
I know, yeah.

16:54.810 --> 16:56.810
[birds chirping]
[water splashing gently]

16:56.810 --> 16:58.420
[footsteps approaching]

16:58.420 --> 17:00.810
You're poisoning
my son against me.

17:00.810 --> 17:03.350
Whispering in his ear about
leaving Abbudin

17:03.360 --> 17:06.480
to open a sweet chic little hotel.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.310
What are you talking about?

17:09.060 --> 17:10.210
London?

17:12.670 --> 17:14.550
It wasn't your idea?

17:15.730 --> 17:16.849
No.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.849
This is the first I've heard of it.

17:18.849 --> 17:21.630
I'm making him
Minister of Energy Development,

17:21.640 --> 17:24.210
and he tells me
he wants to move away.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.359
I assumed you put him up to it.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.150
Why would I do that?

17:29.720 --> 17:31.560
You know I know the deal.

17:31.660 --> 17:33.710
I wouldn't call it that.

17:33.710 --> 17:36.790
You raped me
at your own son's wedding,

17:36.790 --> 17:39.180
and then you killed my father
for defending my honor.

17:39.180 --> 17:41.130
And I'll never say a word
of any of it

17:41.130 --> 17:43.920
or speak against the family
because of this...

17:43.920 --> 17:45.580
Your grandchild.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.960
And this baby, my baby,

17:47.960 --> 17:50.190
is your heir after Ahmed.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.730
[Leila] Jamal?

17:53.950 --> 17:55.850
That's the deal, isn't it?

17:56.830 --> 17:58.630
You wrote the terms.

17:58.630 --> 18:03.170
You want this deal,
you keep your husband in line.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.040
What are you two doing
out here?

18:11.540 --> 18:13.540
[Nusrat chuckles]

18:14.870 --> 18:16.210
He's kicking.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.520
Only when he hears
his grandfather.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.520
[birds chirping]

18:25.230 --> 18:28.840
Come, we need to approve the seating
chart for tomorrow night.

18:29.470 --> 18:31.600
I want it to be just right.

18:32.340 --> 18:33.550
It will be.

18:34.610 --> 18:38.610
[birds chirping]
[water splashes gently]

18:38.610 --> 18:40.810
Put Ahmed next to
the Chinese ambassador.

18:40.810 --> 18:43.440
He needs to develop
that relationship.

18:46.020 --> 18:47.940
And I'll put Nusrat
next to the wife

18:47.940 --> 18:49.690
of the Minister of Culture.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.190
It's good she's managed
to move past

18:53.190 --> 18:54.620
the unpleasant business
with her father

18:54.620 --> 18:56.550
and take her place
in the family.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.090
She's a pragmatic woman.

19:05.380 --> 19:07.410
Colonel Mahmoud
found the target.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.170
I need your approval.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.460
Tell me.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.440
Ihab's weapons depot,
above a dress shop.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.690
That sounds promising.

19:16.690 --> 19:18.390
Proportionate, anyway.

19:18.570 --> 19:20.090
Then I approve.

19:25.090 --> 19:27.390
[footsteps departing]

19:27.390 --> 19:29.950
Where are we putting Tariq?

19:30.250 --> 19:31.960
Set the date, Jamal.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.820
It's time to end this.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.110
Tariq, put you up to this.

19:40.710 --> 19:41.970
So what if he did?

19:41.970 --> 19:44.130
I put Bassam on trial,

19:44.130 --> 19:46.140
asked for
the death sentence.

19:46.140 --> 19:48.090
I've done everything
I said I would do,

19:48.090 --> 19:51.610
and I will do this,
too, in my own time.

19:53.610 --> 19:57.610
[footsteps tapping]
[sound echoes]

20:00.450 --> 20:01.920
I have another color.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.680
[people speaking indistinctly]

20:03.680 --> 20:04.900
Excuse me.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.440
[Arabian music in background]

20:06.440 --> 20:07.930
I'm looking for my daughter.

20:07.930 --> 20:08.990
Where is she?

20:11.500 --> 20:12.550
Samira.

20:12.810 --> 20:14.710
Your father's downstairs.

20:14.710 --> 20:17.710
[people speaking indistinctly]

20:18.470 --> 20:20.930
These were just delivered
by Amnesty.

20:21.460 --> 20:24.970
The Dutch government
granted us political refugee status.

20:25.590 --> 20:26.930
Amsterdam?

20:27.040 --> 20:28.710
I can write from there.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.390
I'll fight from there.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.760
Amnesty's funding
a journal for dissident voices,

20:33.760 --> 20:35.130
and they want me
to run it.

20:35.130 --> 20:38.230
A journal for the Europeans
to feel better about themselves.

20:38.230 --> 20:39.470
[sighs]

20:39.470 --> 20:41.290
This is where the fight is.

20:41.290 --> 20:42.610
Your insurgency?

20:42.610 --> 20:43.700
Yes.

20:44.190 --> 20:46.480
You may not approve,
but Jamal's left us no choice.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.150
This is slow-motion suicide.

20:48.150 --> 20:50.780
We killed seven soldiers today.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.840
And twice as many
the week before.

20:52.860 --> 20:56.680
That's a stalemate with no end
where everybody loses.

20:56.940 --> 20:59.980
And even if you would win,
what happens then?

20:59.980 --> 21:02.730
Half of you are Islamists,
the other half is liberals.

21:02.730 --> 21:03.750
What will it be?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Democracy or theocracy?

21:06.010 --> 21:07.800
We can argue about
what kind of country

21:07.800 --> 21:10.270
this is going to be after
the Al Fayeeds are gone.

21:10.350 --> 21:12.150
We would let the people decide.

21:12.150 --> 21:14.220
It's the one thing
we all agree on...

21:14.220 --> 21:15.900
Self-determination.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.400
Tell me, where were
your friends in Amsterdam

21:18.400 --> 21:19.910
when Jamal
outlawed Ihab's party and

21:19.910 --> 21:21.430
stole the elections?

21:21.430 --> 21:24.060
Or when he shut off
the Internet and sent his soldiers

21:24.060 --> 21:26.430
to hunt us like animals?

21:27.050 --> 21:29.290
Have the last six months
changed me?

21:29.590 --> 21:30.740
Yes.

21:31.210 --> 21:33.650
Yes, because
the world has changed.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.660
And I'm not going to get
my country back

21:35.660 --> 21:38.060
by writing
articles in Amsterdam!

21:40.290 --> 21:42.210
I'm afraid for you.

21:46.540 --> 21:47.930
I'm afraid, too.

21:49.270 --> 21:51.750
But your friend Bassam,

21:52.160 --> 21:54.130
he is still fighting.

21:54.390 --> 21:56.130
So how can we stop?

21:57.090 --> 21:58.630
How can you stop?

22:09.830 --> 22:13.830
[gunshot]
[sound echoes]

22:13.830 --> 22:16.330
[gunshot]
[ground clattering]

22:18.330 --> 22:20.330
[liquid sloshing]

22:22.130 --> 22:26.330
[gunshots]

22:28.820 --> 22:32.010
How come I'm the last one
to find out

22:32.010 --> 22:33.820
that I'm the wife

22:33.930 --> 22:36.730
of the new Minister
of Energy Development?

22:37.010 --> 22:39.170
Doesn't it strike you
a little absurd?

22:39.690 --> 22:42.270
How am I qualified
to be minister of anything?

22:43.500 --> 22:45.740
Your father believes
in your potential.

22:45.740 --> 22:46.520
My potential?

22:46.520 --> 22:47.610
Yes.

22:48.220 --> 22:51.180
For what?
Killing insurgents?

22:51.530 --> 22:53.970
Convincing the same tribes
we've been killing for generations

22:53.970 --> 22:55.080
that we don't hate them
anymore

22:55.090 --> 22:57.930
because we're building
an oil refinery in Ma'an?

22:58.600 --> 23:00.470
Where is this coming from?

23:01.370 --> 23:02.640
From him.

23:03.510 --> 23:04.820
Our child.

23:05.730 --> 23:07.780
I mean,
what if we have a boy?

23:08.100 --> 23:10.640
Maybe another year or two,
we have another son.

23:10.740 --> 23:12.730
What if one tries
to overthrow the other?

23:12.730 --> 23:14.520
This is about your uncle.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.730
My uncle,

23:15.740 --> 23:17.900
your father, Ihab Rashid.

23:18.220 --> 23:21.740
All we know here is blood
and violence and revenge.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.610
- It's what we do.
- Ahmed...

23:23.610 --> 23:24.830
Look at me.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.890
I can't even kill a bottle
of whiskey at 20 paces.

23:30.970 --> 23:32.630
I'm not good at this.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.880
This isn't me.

23:35.020 --> 23:37.010
This isn't the life I want.

23:38.410 --> 23:40.950
And after what
my father did to yours...

23:42.230 --> 23:44.780
I can't see why
you would want it either.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.640
We have enough money
to live wherever we want.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.710
Do you really think that
your father will just let you leave?

23:52.090 --> 23:53.680
His only son?

23:55.010 --> 23:56.810
He'll disinherit you.

23:57.150 --> 24:01.330
This life we have,
it didn't cost you anything.

24:02.460 --> 24:04.960
But I paid for it.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.700
Everything...

24:11.050 --> 24:13.430
that I had
was taken from me.

24:14.630 --> 24:18.010
This baby is an Al Fayeed.

24:19.690 --> 24:23.530
And I want him... or her...

24:23.970 --> 24:26.620
to have whatever that means.

24:29.880 --> 24:34.580
I know that it seems like
a funny kind of revenge...

24:37.280 --> 24:39.030
but it's all I have.

24:47.030 --> 24:49.580
[Samira] Jamal thinks his refinery
will give him legitimacy.

24:49.590 --> 24:50.750
Let him build it.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.530
We'll just tear it down.

24:52.530 --> 24:53.160
[loud explosion]

24:53.160 --> 24:54.040
What's happening?
[loud explosion]

24:54.050 --> 24:55.090
- Wait here.
- Ihab...

24:55.090 --> 24:56.130
Wait here!

24:56.130 --> 24:58.130
[people screaming]

24:58.130 --> 25:00.130
[explosion]

25:00.130 --> 25:03.130
[screaming continues]

25:03.640 --> 25:05.810
Our weapons!

25:06.890 --> 25:08.140
Our weapons!

25:08.140 --> 25:09.450
Hey! Malik!

25:09.450 --> 25:10.850
Musa sold us out!

25:10.850 --> 25:11.940
Musa is no traitor.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.590
Ibrahim caught him leaving
Ma'an half an hour ago.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.150
With his wife.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.780
I swear to God,
I didn't sell you out.

25:19.780 --> 25:20.580
Bullshit!

25:20.580 --> 25:22.860
Malik told us
everything you said!

25:22.860 --> 25:24.860
[crickets chirping]

25:28.050 --> 25:29.270
[voice breaking] So it's true.

25:31.350 --> 25:32.250
It's true.

25:32.250 --> 25:35.340
I don't want to become
a martyr to a hopeless cause.

25:36.610 --> 25:39.540
We'll never have enough
bullets or bombs to beat Jamal.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.320
I'm only saying out loud

25:41.320 --> 25:43.910
what each and every one of us
is already thinking!

25:44.180 --> 25:46.000
We're dying for nothing!

25:47.210 --> 25:48.870
The people are getting tired

25:48.870 --> 25:51.580
of the raids and the checkpoints.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.210
And they're blaming us.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.870
And look at us!

25:56.010 --> 25:57.470
We're turning on each other.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.180
You can kill me,

26:00.710 --> 26:03.770
but whoever betrayed you
will still be out there.

26:10.670 --> 26:11.850
Musa...

26:15.210 --> 26:16.520
I believe you.

26:16.930 --> 26:19.540
I know that you are no traitor.

26:21.290 --> 26:22.750
You don't have...

26:23.170 --> 26:25.330
don't have the balls
to be a traitor.

26:25.330 --> 26:28.330
[woman crying]

26:30.070 --> 26:31.500
Go to Beirut.

26:32.140 --> 26:33.120
Go.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.500
To Beirut.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.590
Anyone else
who wants to go with him,

26:40.590 --> 26:41.290
you can go now.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.310
I...
I won't stop you. [pats on legs]

26:43.310 --> 26:46.310
[crickets chirping]

26:50.680 --> 26:53.090
Jamal Al Fayeed...

26:53.600 --> 26:55.050
He can take all our weapons.

26:55.060 --> 26:58.170
I will get new weapons.

26:58.190 --> 26:59.560
We will keep

26:59.560 --> 27:01.820
striking him and striking him

27:02.190 --> 27:03.990
until he falls.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.240
Allow her to see Bassam.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.150
No harm can come of it.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.240
She's still the mother
of your niece and nephew,

27:11.240 --> 27:13.230
and they are still your family.

27:13.290 --> 27:15.590
Since when
did you become her advocate?

27:15.590 --> 27:17.350
We've spent
some time together...

27:17.550 --> 27:19.010
in the last few months.

27:19.010 --> 27:20.310
Didn't know that.

27:20.780 --> 27:22.970
It's made it easier for us both,

27:22.970 --> 27:25.060
to have someone to talk to.

27:25.370 --> 27:28.180
Please, stop looking at her.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.000
Zero contact.

27:31.010 --> 27:33.470
That was my explicit order.

27:33.670 --> 27:35.150
Now, please...

27:36.130 --> 27:37.570
just leave.

27:38.850 --> 27:40.300
Think about it.

27:42.300 --> 27:44.300
[door opens]
[hinges squeak]

27:44.300 --> 27:45.700
[slapping sound]

27:45.700 --> 27:48.730
You're torturing everyone
with your indecision.

27:50.220 --> 27:51.810
Including yourself.

27:52.020 --> 27:56.250
Including Bassam, for whom
I'm sure this wait is no favor.

27:56.390 --> 27:57.280
Don't cross me.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.750
- I told you...
- Al Jazeera.

27:58.750 --> 28:01.540
Those monkeys
are calling you Hamlet.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.180
The President
who cannot make up his mind.

28:06.420 --> 28:09.220
We are hosting a state dinner.

28:09.380 --> 28:12.010
It's supposed to be a celebration.

28:12.100 --> 28:15.220
I can't very well kill my brother

28:15.220 --> 28:17.490
while our guests are here.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.590
Then do it before.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.470
Make the arrival
of the Chinese your deadline.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.760
Otherwise,
this will go on forever.

28:29.740 --> 28:31.870
And how will
the pain go away?

28:33.480 --> 28:36.160
How will it ever be better, Jamal?

28:44.140 --> 28:46.460
[Molly] Stop me
if I've already told you this story.

28:47.710 --> 28:49.990
Barry and I went
to Paris, like...

28:50.870 --> 28:53.030
six months
after we got married.

28:53.420 --> 28:54.860
I haven't heard this one.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.620
Romantic, but on the cheap.

28:56.620 --> 28:58.570
One of those hotel rooms

28:58.580 --> 29:00.940
where you roll off
the bed right into the toilet.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.080
April in Paris.

29:03.430 --> 29:06.770
It was maybe 30 degrees,
snowed every day.

29:06.770 --> 29:08.930
[laughs] Some bad
trip karma.

29:09.430 --> 29:11.430
[sniffs]

29:12.360 --> 29:14.950
Yeah. I have that problem.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.280
If I close my eyes,

29:19.280 --> 29:20.420
[swallows liquor]

29:20.420 --> 29:23.060
I can almost remember
I came here

29:23.190 --> 29:25.020
to go to a wedding.

29:29.450 --> 29:30.820
And now...

29:30.820 --> 29:33.820
[sighs deeply]

29:36.010 --> 29:38.490
I think the message is...

29:39.120 --> 29:40.700
"Stay home."

29:40.700 --> 29:42.700
[sighs]

29:42.700 --> 29:44.700
[sniffles, exhales]

29:44.700 --> 29:46.490
[door bangs open]

29:46.490 --> 29:47.330
Let's go.

29:47.330 --> 29:48.390
Exley?

29:49.300 --> 29:50.410
Exley...

29:52.210 --> 29:54.210
[cell door rolls, slams]

29:54.210 --> 29:57.700
I told you,
I'm not playing anymore!

29:57.700 --> 29:59.700
[pawns clatter and rumble hitting ground]

30:08.700 --> 30:11.700
[both gasping and sighing]

30:14.700 --> 30:16.700
[whispers] Hey...

30:18.470 --> 30:21.070
[Barry scoffs]

30:21.070 --> 30:22.320
I missed you.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.400
I was sure I was
never gonna see you again.

30:28.570 --> 30:29.410
Barry...

30:32.210 --> 30:33.340
it's over.

30:34.270 --> 30:35.280
Tomorrow morning,

30:35.280 --> 30:37.310
they're carrying out
your sentence.

30:37.310 --> 30:39.310
[both sigh]

30:42.810 --> 30:45.550
Hey... Molly.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.050
It's okay.

30:48.940 --> 30:49.840
All right?

30:51.090 --> 30:51.990
I'm ready.

30:51.990 --> 30:53.990
[sighs]

30:58.600 --> 31:00.560
Um, they're making me
leave tonight.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.400
There's a plane.

31:06.020 --> 31:07.130
Do the kids know?

31:08.590 --> 31:10.970
The soldiers took my phone
before I could call them.

31:15.060 --> 31:16.640
When you see them, tell them

31:17.010 --> 31:19.490
that their letters kept me sane.

31:19.780 --> 31:20.670
Okay?

31:20.930 --> 31:24.670
Or... saner
than I would've been.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.270
I will.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.790
They love you so much.

31:33.740 --> 31:34.690
Did, um...

31:35.300 --> 31:37.680
did Sammy sign up
for the S.A.T.?

31:37.680 --> 31:38.780
It's coming up soon, right?

31:38.780 --> 31:40.240
Yeah, I'm on it.
Jenna's on it.

31:40.240 --> 31:40.960
- Okay.
- [Molly sniffles]

31:41.720 --> 31:44.760
My practice,
uh, the partnership

31:44.760 --> 31:46.910
agreement's in the safe
in my office.

31:46.910 --> 31:48.590
Lorraine's got the combination.

31:48.590 --> 31:49.800
And for all of the legal side,

31:49.800 --> 31:51.270
you got to talk to Rachel Wilson.

31:51.270 --> 31:52.490
- She's...
- I know. I know.

31:52.490 --> 31:53.570
I made a list.

31:54.090 --> 31:55.630
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

31:55.980 --> 31:56.860
Okay?

31:59.370 --> 32:00.970
I feel like there's so much
I want to tell you

32:00.970 --> 32:02.500
I don't know where to start.

32:02.500 --> 32:06.500
[inhales and exhales deeply]

32:08.560 --> 32:09.540
Could you just...

32:10.770 --> 32:13.170
tell me that...
you forgive me?

32:15.880 --> 32:18.750
Or that you understand
why I did what I did.

32:31.020 --> 32:33.020
[exhales sharply]

32:33.020 --> 32:35.290
Everybody lies in this place
but you.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.470
Everything you said
Jamal would do, he's done.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.990
Outlawed free speech,
the opposition...

32:50.170 --> 32:51.240
But, Barry...

32:53.470 --> 32:55.210
you've inspired the people.

32:57.390 --> 32:58.500
Free Bassam.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.180
Free Abbudin.

33:01.230 --> 33:02.730
You've become a symbol.

33:05.570 --> 33:07.490
So, what happened,

33:07.880 --> 33:09.000
what you did...

33:13.320 --> 33:15.170
your life will have mattered.

33:18.020 --> 33:20.400
Your death
won't have been in vain.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.600
I'm sorry I made a mess of us.

33:31.220 --> 33:32.070
No.

33:32.070 --> 33:33.360
[cell door rolls open]

33:33.360 --> 33:34.150
No.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.240
[soldier] It's time.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.210
No.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.060
You said five minutes.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.020
You said five minutes, please. Please.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.610
- Been five minutes.
- No.

33:43.790 --> 33:45.080
No, no. Please. Please.

33:45.080 --> 33:45.890
Please, no.

33:45.890 --> 33:46.830
I love you.

33:47.170 --> 33:48.280
You hear me? I love you.

33:48.470 --> 33:49.970
I love you.
I love... [smooches]

33:51.270 --> 33:52.260
Okay. Hold on.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.240
I love you.

34:00.350 --> 34:01.150
Molly?

34:03.050 --> 34:06.950
[cell door rolls, slams]
[sound echoes]

34:06.950 --> 34:08.949
[sighs]

34:23.650 --> 34:26.949
[water spraying]

34:26.949 --> 34:29.949
[gasping]

34:31.949 --> 34:34.949
[plane engine running for take-off]

34:41.949 --> 34:43.949
[engine roaring]

35:25.950 --> 35:29.950
[footsteps rustling]

36:05.450 --> 36:08.450
[hatch clattering]

36:08.450 --> 36:10.450
[feet thumping]

36:10.450 --> 36:13.450
[rope creaking]

36:59.450 --> 37:01.950
[retching]
[liquid splashing]

37:01.950 --> 37:03.950
[gasping and sighing]

37:03.950 --> 37:07.950
[sobbing]

37:15.950 --> 37:18.950
[breathing heavily]

37:25.350 --> 37:28.350
[shower water running, dripping]

37:36.350 --> 37:39.350
[dripping sound continues]

37:52.350 --> 37:55.350
[cars engine roar]

37:59.930 --> 38:01.550
Tonight's going
to be a greater night

38:01.550 --> 38:03.320
than your father ever had.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.740
The world is going
to take notice of us.

38:11.050 --> 38:12.060
[Amira] Where is he?

38:13.620 --> 38:14.740
Oh, not now.

38:14.790 --> 38:16.500
[Tariq] Amira, please,
don't do this.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.120
You're as much
to blame as he is.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.120
[Amira sighing] You murder!

38:20.120 --> 38:23.160
[indistinct conversation]

38:23.160 --> 38:25.030
[voice breaking] You murdered
your brother.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.680
[sobbing] You just killed him.

38:27.940 --> 38:29.510
You didn't tell me.

38:30.420 --> 38:31.380
My son...

38:31.810 --> 38:34.790
Who tried to steal
the place of your other son.

38:34.910 --> 38:37.220
And you celebrate 
the same night!

38:37.220 --> 38:39.190
Only a monster
 would do that.

38:39.190 --> 38:41.070
Apparently, you have trouble
figuring out

38:41.070 --> 38:42.960
who the real monster is.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.590
Please take her
 out of here.

38:44.590 --> 38:45.380
Amira.

38:45.380 --> 38:48.380
[Amira crying]

38:49.240 --> 38:50.170
Murderer.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.850
You murderer.

38:52.850 --> 38:54.850
[crying continues and fades]

39:03.940 --> 39:05.390
Mr. Ambassador.

39:05.770 --> 39:06.570
Madam.

39:06.570 --> 39:08.150
[speaks in Chinese]

39:08.150 --> 39:09.680
Welcome to Abbudin.

39:10.050 --> 39:12.590
We've been looking forward
to your visit.

39:16.560 --> 39:18.560
[plane engine running]

39:19.760 --> 39:21.760
[engine decelerates]

39:22.260 --> 39:23.370
Media's swarming the gate.

39:23.370 --> 39:25.540
We're gonna meet
your family on the tarmac.

39:27.750 --> 39:28.620
Need a minute?

39:29.340 --> 39:30.920
I just need to see my kids.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.920
[sniffles, gasps]

39:59.930 --> 40:00.780
He told me to tell you

40:00.780 --> 40:02.590
how much he loves you both.

40:08.730 --> 40:10.260
[reporter] The Taliban claimed
the responsibility for the

40:10.260 --> 40:12.000
attack that killed 17 mourners

40:12.000 --> 40:14.430
in a funeral procession
outside Peshawar.

40:14.490 --> 40:16.240
Earlier this morning
in Abbudin,

40:16.240 --> 40:16.970
the government announced

40:16.970 --> 40:20.250
that Bassam Al Fayeed
has been executed.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.240
The American citizen
was convicted last month

40:22.240 --> 40:24.700
for inciting a failed coup
against his brother,

40:24.700 --> 40:26.480
President Jamal Al Fayeed.

40:31.070 --> 40:32.400
You have to wake up.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.820
Wake up from
whatever dream you're in.

40:35.630 --> 40:37.910
There's no hope here anymore,

40:38.120 --> 40:40.590
only chaos or tyranny.

40:41.010 --> 40:42.640
- Father...
- You don't have to say anything.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.560
Just use it
whenever you want.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.490
I know it's not
the home we hoped for,

40:51.570 --> 40:53.120
but it can be home enough.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.580
Maybe you should go with him.

41:28.580 --> 41:29.430
Don't.

41:30.050 --> 41:31.180
Samira.

41:31.180 --> 41:33.180
[Ihab sighs]

41:33.980 --> 41:35.600
Maybe your father is right.

41:37.010 --> 41:39.150
Maybe there isn't
any winning anymore.

41:39.260 --> 41:41.260
[scoffs]

41:41.260 --> 41:43.260
[blows out air]

41:43.260 --> 41:44.670
I'm not going to watch you die.

41:44.710 --> 41:45.840
I'm not going to.

41:47.220 --> 41:49.640
Listen, this is my home.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.640
[sniffles]

41:52.780 --> 41:53.890
You are my home.

41:54.530 --> 41:55.870
I won't run away.

41:56.770 --> 41:58.540
We need to keep faith.

42:01.100 --> 42:02.070
We'll find an opening.

42:02.070 --> 42:04.060
Jamal will make a mistake.

42:05.580 --> 42:08.380
Hey...

42:09.380 --> 42:12.490
We're going to live a long life.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.490
[grunts]

42:26.290 --> 42:29.290
[smooches]

42:49.290 --> 42:52.290
[panting]

43:17.900 --> 43:19.880
How long will this take, Arif?

43:19.980 --> 43:20.800
Not long.

43:23.630 --> 43:24.430
Go.

43:28.430 --> 43:30.430
[Bassam gasps]

43:31.430 --> 43:34.430
[coughing]

43:42.740 --> 43:43.670
Jamal.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.540
You're not dead, Bassam.

43:46.650 --> 43:48.090
At least not yet.

43:49.000 --> 43:49.790
Wha...?

43:50.290 --> 43:51.760
Arif sedated you,

43:52.440 --> 43:54.990
switched you with
another enemy of the State

43:54.990 --> 43:57.050
who had an appointment
with the gallows.

43:57.050 --> 43:59.050
[Bassam scoffs]

44:00.160 --> 44:02.170
Why didn't you just
 let me hang?

44:04.420 --> 44:07.960
I could have forgiven you
for killing me, Bassam.

44:08.640 --> 44:09.770
Really, I could have.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.440
[inhales deeply]

44:14.440 --> 44:16.570
But making me
kill you... [exhaling]

44:17.290 --> 44:20.370
that I could have never
forgiven you for.

44:23.530 --> 44:27.130
Your blood
won't be on my hands.

44:29.080 --> 44:32.740
This land you betrayed me for,
your own brother,

44:32.740 --> 44:34.160
I give it to you.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.530
All of it.

44:39.710 --> 44:43.400
Let the land
you claim to love so much...

44:45.610 --> 44:46.810
take care of you.

44:48.900 --> 44:49.820
Jamal.

44:51.420 --> 44:54.420
[helicopter engine whirring]

45:02.420 --> 45:05.720
[helicopter pales flapping]

45:05.720 --> 45:07.720
Jamal.

45:18.020 --> 45:19.720
Jamal.

45:20.720 --> 45:23.720
