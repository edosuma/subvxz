WEBVTT

00:03.267 --> 00:07.165
I was feeling
some energy upstairs.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.767
There's a guy sitting in
the corner drinking whiskey.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.500
He wants to know
what we're doing here.

00:16.133 --> 00:20.267
The back of the bookshelf
burst into flames.

00:20.302 --> 00:22.865
A paranormal fire?

00:22.900 --> 00:24.867
We've been literally
sleeping in shifts.

00:24.902 --> 00:26.933
Sorry.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.232
What the hell was that?

00:36.333 --> 00:38.465
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.700
I was only 8
when a paranormal incident

00:40.735 --> 00:42.533
changed my life forever.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.865
Since then,
I've dedicated my time

00:45.900 --> 00:49.367
to solving the most terrifying
hauntings imaginable.

00:49.402 --> 00:50.865
I'm Adam Berry.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.400
More than a decade ago,
an encounter at gettysburg

00:53.435 --> 00:55.767
rocked my beliefs
about the supernatural.

00:55.802 --> 00:57.700
Together,
we uncover the truth

00:57.735 --> 00:59.733
behind
the unexplainable.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.698
Oh.
Oh, my god.

01:01.733 --> 01:04.566
Now we are on
our most important mission yet.

01:05.567 --> 01:08.132
Helping families
overcome their fear,

01:08.167 --> 01:12.533
take back their homes,
and reclaim their lives.

01:12.568 --> 01:15.433
synced by dom.smrc

01:23.800 --> 01:25.600
Adam, I have a family
in Bristol, Vermont,

01:25.635 --> 01:27.165
who really needs our help.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.800
They believe a paranormal force
has been following them

01:29.835 --> 01:32.900
from previous homes
in Florida and Georgia.

01:32.935 --> 01:35.465
They can't escape it.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.867
They also happen to live
right across the street

01:37.902 --> 01:40.032
from a cemetery.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.933
- I assume that's the house.
- That's the house, right there.

01:44.267 --> 01:46.067
Probably the most frightening
thing that's happened

01:46.102 --> 01:49.700
is they have had a fire
start in the house.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.298
A paranormal fire?

01:51.333 --> 01:53.367
They can't explain
how it started.

01:53.402 --> 01:54.398
They are freaked out.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.465
Like, like they are
legitimately scared.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.333
They're really worried
about their daughter Gillian.

01:59.368 --> 02:00.934
She's seeing apparitions
in her room.

02:00.969 --> 02:02.465
She's having
a lot of trouble with it.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.867
She's not sleeping.
She's suffering because of this.

02:04.902 --> 02:06.032
Yeah.

02:06.067 --> 02:08.232
With everything Gillian
is going through,

02:08.267 --> 02:10.567
you can't have a more
important case than this one.

02:10.602 --> 02:11.598
The urgency is there.

02:11.633 --> 02:12.700
You want to head
of there, and...

02:12.735 --> 02:14.633
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's go.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.465
What's going on?

02:18.500 --> 02:22.800
We've had activity
that's been kind of following us

02:22.835 --> 02:25.265
around the last couple years,

02:25.300 --> 02:29.433
and a lot of it is associated
with our daughter Gillian.

02:29.468 --> 02:31.134
And where did
you live before?

02:31.169 --> 02:32.765
Georgia
for about 20 years,

02:32.800 --> 02:37.067
Florida for about a year,
and then up here since June.

02:37.102 --> 02:40.800
Now how soon after moving here
did you realize

02:40.835 --> 02:43.098
that it had followed you?

02:43.133 --> 02:46.232
Maybe about
four or five months?

02:46.267 --> 02:49.900
But since we've been here,
there's been other activity

02:49.935 --> 02:51.198
that hasn't been normal

02:51.233 --> 02:53.450
for what we've been
going through.

02:53.485 --> 02:55.667
- Seems it's escalating.
- Escalating.

02:55.702 --> 02:56.798
- Right.
- A scary level.

02:56.833 --> 03:03.533
More of a violent
or aggressive nature to it.

03:03.568 --> 03:06.132
We had a fire
in my office.

03:06.167 --> 03:10.200
Along that wall, right there,
there was a stand-up bookshelf,

03:10.235 --> 03:12.951
just like the other
one in the corner,

03:12.986 --> 03:15.632
so we had these
little tea candles,

03:15.667 --> 03:18.467
and we had two
that were on my bookshelf

03:18.502 --> 03:20.365
on the second level up,

03:20.400 --> 03:26.400
and there was actually three
goalie masks that were on there.

03:26.435 --> 03:29.100
It was about 9:00 P.M.,
and then Kelley heard, like,

03:29.135 --> 03:31.498
a crack and a pop noise.

03:31.533 --> 03:34.733
The back of the bookshelf
burst into flames.

03:38.067 --> 03:41.000
Still have no idea
how it happened.

03:41.035 --> 03:43.933
They were just two
little tea candles,

03:43.968 --> 03:45.233
and how hot do they burn?

03:45.268 --> 03:46.398
Right.

03:46.433 --> 03:50.850
It wasn't as if the masks
were on fire or above it.

03:50.885 --> 03:55.267
It was the back of the bookshelf
that had caught fire.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.398
Okay.

03:56.433 --> 03:57.433
I let those burn out
all the time in my house.

03:57.468 --> 03:58.532
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

03:58.567 --> 04:00.267
I've never even thought
twice about it.

04:00.302 --> 04:01.532
- Right.
- Yeah.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.117
Yeah, because
they're tiny little...

04:03.152 --> 04:04.667
Did you take photos
or anything?

04:04.702 --> 04:06.032
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.167
If you could send those to us,
that would be awesome.

04:07.202 --> 04:08.365
- Right.
- Definitely.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.400
I have a fireman friend
I'm going to ask about it

04:11.435 --> 04:13.032
and see what he thinks.

04:13.067 --> 04:14.800
So you must have been
totally freaked out

04:14.835 --> 04:16.132
having a fire in the house.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.367
Your first concern
is obviously

04:18.402 --> 04:19.865
the safety of everybody.

04:19.899 --> 04:22.932
- Yeah. I know.
- It's okay.

04:22.967 --> 04:25.633
- That's scary though.
- I'm sorry.

04:25.668 --> 04:27.050
- No.
- It's frightening.

04:27.085 --> 04:28.398
But you caught it in time.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.733
- Caught it in time.
- Thankfully.

04:30.768 --> 04:32.767
- Sorry.
- No, you're fine.

04:36.167 --> 04:39.600
It's a lot, and then now
you're probably worried like,

04:39.635 --> 04:41.601
"Is that
going to happen again?"

04:41.636 --> 04:43.532
Yeah.
Now we're not sleeping.

04:43.567 --> 04:46.732
We've been literally
sleeping in shifts,

04:46.767 --> 04:51.532
and it's just been
exhausting and terrifying.

04:51.567 --> 04:53.500
If could explain to you
exactly how that happened,

04:53.535 --> 04:54.398
is that going to...

04:54.433 --> 04:56.698
That would be
immensely helpful.

04:56.733 --> 04:59.632
I have seen, in my life
and in past cases,

04:59.667 --> 05:02.467
where there have been
unexplained fires started.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.532
It's very rare, but, you know,

05:04.567 --> 05:08.083
it something that
has been reported before.

05:08.118 --> 05:12.209
When me and Kelley
had regrouped to the kitchen

05:12.244 --> 05:16.022
over from behind us,
where the outside door is,

05:16.057 --> 05:18.662
there were four
really loud, aggressive bangs.

05:18.697 --> 05:20.582
It's like somebody
was banging on your door.

05:20.617 --> 05:22.467
Kelley: I thought initially
that it was,

05:22.502 --> 05:23.732
like, a neighbor running

05:23.767 --> 05:26.150
because they saw fire,
you know?

05:26.185 --> 05:28.533
Pounding to make sure
we're okay.

05:28.568 --> 05:29.565
And turned... nobody.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.765
- Nobody there?
- Three feet of snow,

05:31.800 --> 05:35.050
and we have two motion sensor
lights in the back.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.300
There was no footprints,
no sign of disturbance.

05:38.335 --> 05:39.432
The lights
didn't go off.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.100
The lights didn't go off
or anything like that.

05:41.135 --> 05:44.065
That's so weird.

05:44.100 --> 05:51.100
In here we have both
experienced conversations.

05:51.135 --> 05:53.232
Like,
I'll be lying in bed,

05:53.267 --> 05:56.067
and it will sound
like there is two people

05:56.102 --> 05:58.067
standing at the foot
of my bed

05:58.102 --> 05:59.600
saying something.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.100
You can't make out
what they're saying, really,

06:06.135 --> 06:08.867
but you know that
a conversation is taking place.

06:08.902 --> 06:13.367
I almost feel like
it's a man and a woman.

06:13.402 --> 06:15.467
Do you hear it
anywhere else?

06:15.502 --> 06:16.565
No.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.665
Just in this room.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.333
So this is
Gillian's room, yeah?

06:21.368 --> 06:22.798
Yes.
All right.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.532
And she's had
experiences in here?

06:24.567 --> 06:27.400
Yes, she can describe it best,
obviously,

06:27.435 --> 06:32.465
but she sees a man,
shadow man,

06:32.500 --> 06:35.733
and she's had
tapping at the window.

06:35.768 --> 06:38.967
Had anybody else
seen these apparitions?

06:39.002 --> 06:39.800
- No.
- So just her?

06:39.835 --> 06:40.498
Yes.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.665
And as she explains it,

06:41.700 --> 06:43.767
she doesn't, like,
really see them.

06:43.802 --> 06:46.165
She more
senses them, but...

06:46.200 --> 06:48.433
In her mind's eye she knows
what they look like.

06:48.468 --> 06:49.732
Yeah.

06:49.767 --> 06:53.100
So these entities have
come with you on your travels?

06:53.135 --> 06:54.098
Yes.

06:54.133 --> 06:57.200
And as time goes on,
the man has gotten

06:57.235 --> 07:00.417
from outside the house
at Marietta

07:00.452 --> 07:03.565
to being in the room
with her.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.700
And I'm assuming you guys
have taken her to, like,

07:05.735 --> 07:07.032
a doctor and everything.

07:07.067 --> 07:09.633
- Yes.
- And what did they have to say?

07:09.668 --> 07:11.432
They feel it might be,

07:11.467 --> 07:14.567
like, an anxiety type
of hallucination.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.665
Mm-hmm.
What about Aiden?

07:15.700 --> 07:16.833
Has he ever experienced
any activity?

07:16.868 --> 07:17.798
No.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.600
- None?
- None. - None. Nope.

07:19.635 --> 07:20.701
Doesn't believe in it.

07:20.736 --> 07:21.951
Hasn't experienced it.

07:21.986 --> 07:23.443
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

07:23.478 --> 07:24.865
How convinced are you

07:24.900 --> 07:27.567
that what she's experiencing
is paranormal?

07:27.602 --> 07:31.067
I'm 99.9% convinced.

07:35.433 --> 07:38.067
Before we sit down with
Gillian and her brother, Aiden,

07:38.102 --> 07:40.800
we want to focus
on the house itself.

07:44.267 --> 07:47.865
I have a Mini DVA,
K- II, EMF, Panasonic.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.467
We'll start in the office, since
that's where the fire happened.

07:51.502 --> 07:53.132
So right there
is where the...

07:53.167 --> 07:55.698
- Yes.
- ...shelf was that set fire.

07:55.733 --> 08:00.233
You can see where
it's all bubbled still.

08:00.268 --> 08:02.467
Wait.

08:04.533 --> 08:05.498
What's that?

08:05.533 --> 08:08.533
I thought I heard,
like, a voice.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.065
This is recording.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.767
Let's just sit
and listen.

08:16.802 --> 08:18.867
Let's get the...

08:18.902 --> 08:19.832
Here.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.733
It almost sounded
like a female.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.750
Give me one sec.
Just listen.

08:23.785 --> 08:25.733
Here, I'm going
to put this here.

08:31.267 --> 08:34.133
You're probably just getting
to know Sam and his family,

08:34.168 --> 08:36.765
and you're reaching out
and talking to them.

08:36.799 --> 08:41.100
However, if you're going to talk
to anybody, it should be us,

08:41.135 --> 08:43.601
because we can
actually record you,

08:43.635 --> 08:46.067
find out who you are,
what you want,

08:46.102 --> 08:48.732
deliver a message
for you.

08:48.767 --> 08:53.533
We can help you,
so please talk to us.

08:53.568 --> 08:55.598
These devices
that we have,

08:55.633 --> 08:58.233
they can hear you
even if we can't,

08:58.268 --> 08:59.332
so if you're here,

08:59.367 --> 09:02.100
can you just make a noise
wherever you are?

09:06.333 --> 09:09.067
What the hell was that?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.400
That's right
in this room.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.333
If that was you knocking,
can you do it again?

09:27.900 --> 09:31.433
Hold on.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.600
Is the heater coming on?
Is that what it was?

09:39.067 --> 09:41.232
- What?
- Holy ***!

09:41.267 --> 09:43.067
I think I saw something
on that camera.

09:43.102 --> 09:44.433
What? What?
What? What? What?

09:46.000 --> 09:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:03.400 --> 10:04.765
- What?
- Holy ***!

10:04.800 --> 10:06.767
I think I saw something
on that camera.

10:06.802 --> 10:08.765
What? What? What?
What? What?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.300
I think I just something
on this camera.

10:10.335 --> 10:11.267
Really? Rewind.
Rewind. Rewind.

10:11.302 --> 10:12.901
Right here.

10:12.936 --> 10:14.500
Hold on.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.600
Oh!

10:16.635 --> 10:17.965
What?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.298
That's the cat.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.665
How did the cat get out?

10:22.700 --> 10:24.367
Look. Watch him.
This is us coming in.

10:24.402 --> 10:25.367
And then
where does he go?

10:25.402 --> 10:28.433
Is that what we heard?

10:28.468 --> 10:29.632
There he goes.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.500
Yeah, but he didn't
make a sound, did he?

10:31.535 --> 10:33.132
I don't know.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.983
The sound
was from in here.

10:35.018 --> 10:36.765
Yeah.
He's just walking.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.766
He's not making
tapping noises.

10:38.801 --> 10:40.834
No, and, honestly,
he's upstairs,

10:40.869 --> 10:42.584
and that sound
came from over here.

10:42.619 --> 10:44.300
Right, okay,
so something was tapping.

10:44.335 --> 10:45.265
Do you think it was the...

10:45.300 --> 10:46.798
Tap it and see
because I feel...

10:46.833 --> 10:48.633
That's what it kind of
like it sounded like to me.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.366
Feel it.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.465
Its not on.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.132
Okay, well, it was
telling us it was here,

10:56.167 --> 10:58.067
so we should probably continue
with what we were doing.

10:58.102 --> 11:00.432
Yeah.

11:00.467 --> 11:01.667
All right.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.067
Okay.

11:06.367 --> 11:09.833
Did you see the fire
start in this house?

11:10.667 --> 11:13.333
Do you know
who did that?

11:14.267 --> 11:16.598
Again.

11:16.633 --> 11:18.667
Right after I talked
about the fire.

11:18.702 --> 11:20.433
I keep recording.

11:22.067 --> 11:26.100
Is there something that you want
to tell us about the fire?

11:26.135 --> 11:29.498
How did that fire start?

11:29.533 --> 11:31.132
If you hear yourself
on this recorder,

11:31.167 --> 11:34.067
reach out and touch that
green light in front of me.

11:43.067 --> 11:46.432
Ooh.

11:46.467 --> 11:49.367
I literally said, "If you hear
yourself in that recording",

11:49.402 --> 11:51.517
grab this green light
and make it go off,"

11:51.552 --> 11:53.633
and as soon as
you talked about the fire,

11:53.668 --> 11:56.333
it started doing that.

11:58.967 --> 12:01.432
That's, like, footsteps.

12:01.467 --> 12:04.500
Yeah, it's, like,
right behind us.

12:04.535 --> 12:05.598
Like, thunk.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.232
Thunk. Thunk. Thunk.
Very slow.

12:08.267 --> 12:11.667
It sounded like either footsteps
or someone knocking slowly.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.700
There it is again.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.933
There.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.867
What is that?
Hold on.

12:21.902 --> 12:23.432
Is it out here?

12:23.467 --> 12:24.500
Maybe if we go upstairs.

12:24.535 --> 12:28.032
I think so, too.

12:28.067 --> 12:32.067
So we heard
a female voice downstairs.

12:32.102 --> 12:34.765
We've heard
lots of knocks.

12:34.800 --> 12:39.600
Do you know anything about the
fire that started downstairs?

12:39.635 --> 12:42.517
Whose fault was it?

12:42.552 --> 12:45.365
Was it an accident?

12:45.400 --> 12:49.400
You're not going to get into
any trouble, but was it you?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.567
All right.
Let's see.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.200
Maybe yes.

13:05.433 --> 13:06.832
No.

13:06.867 --> 13:09.267
Did you hear that right
at the end? It was like, "No."

13:09.302 --> 13:10.732
I don't know.

13:10.767 --> 13:11.933
This is confusing.

13:11.968 --> 13:14.250
We are getting things.

13:14.285 --> 13:16.498
We are getting things.

13:16.533 --> 13:19.816
I think that we need
more information, though.

13:19.851 --> 13:23.100
I just really feel
you should talk to Gillian.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.700
I'd be happy
to talk to her.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.933
There's definitely
activity in this house,

13:32.968 --> 13:35.065
but so far it's inconsistent.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.967
Could it be connected to
the cemetery across the street?

13:38.002 --> 13:40.567
Is there more
than one ghost hanging around?

13:40.602 --> 13:43.133
We're going to sit down
with the kids.

13:43.168 --> 13:44.365
Adam will talk to Aiden,

13:44.400 --> 13:46.433
who doesn't believe
in the paranormal,

13:46.468 --> 13:47.665
and I will speak with Gillian

13:47.700 --> 13:49.700
who has more experiences
through the years

13:49.735 --> 13:51.632
than anyone else
in this family.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.750
Let's talk about
the paranormal stuff.

13:53.785 --> 13:55.833
What do you think
about everything?

13:55.868 --> 13:57.932
I believe
it is paranormal.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.165
There's no, like,
explanation, you know,

14:00.200 --> 14:05.967
for how the fire started
and, you know, knocking.

14:06.002 --> 14:08.598
What is it that
you're experiencing?

14:08.633 --> 14:13.467
For about five years now
I would sense this man,

14:13.502 --> 14:15.732
like a silhouette...

14:15.767 --> 14:17.865
- Right.
- ...shadow kind of figure

14:17.900 --> 14:22.366
watching me, and had a very
mean, like, energy about him.

14:22.401 --> 14:26.833
Have you ever had anything
paranormal happen to you ever?

14:26.868 --> 14:27.798
No.
Nothing.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.665
What about the fire?

14:29.700 --> 14:32.567
Just seems like a normal,
like, accident.

14:32.602 --> 14:34.967
Are you afraid
of the man?

14:35.002 --> 14:37.032
Yeah.

14:37.067 --> 14:42.200
He just has such
a terrible energy about him.

14:42.235 --> 14:44.865
What do you think
he could do to you?

14:44.900 --> 14:49.767
I mean, if he was the one
to start the fire,

14:49.802 --> 14:53.300
I'm afraid
he'll try something again.

14:53.335 --> 14:54.798
How do you
want this to end?

14:54.833 --> 14:58.067
I would like to see it end
in my family just,

14:58.102 --> 15:00.498
like,
at a sense of peace.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.198
I don't like seeing them
scared by all this.

15:03.233 --> 15:06.700
Do you feel like there's
anything else in this house?

15:06.735 --> 15:09.500
Because we live across
a graveyard,

15:09.535 --> 15:11.332
I don't really know.

15:11.367 --> 15:15.667
And your parents took you
to a doctor, right?

15:15.702 --> 15:20.065
For the past year,
you know,

15:20.100 --> 15:21.332
I've been going
to see a therapist

15:21.367 --> 15:24.767
because I was thinking maybe
this is something different,

15:24.802 --> 15:27.834
and everybody told me,
you know...

15:27.869 --> 15:30.832
I would describe it,
and they said,

15:30.867 --> 15:33.432
"You're having hallucinations.
You're insane."

15:33.467 --> 15:36.067
But you're not, though,
because you're not seeing it,

15:36.102 --> 15:37.032
you're sensing it.

15:37.067 --> 15:38.800
Yeah, and that's
what I was saying.

15:38.835 --> 15:41.467
I was...
I'm not seeing a person,

15:41.502 --> 15:44.034
like, you know,
around everywhere.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.532
- Right.
- I'm sensing it at night.

15:46.567 --> 15:49.317
I feel like there is
something else going on.

15:49.352 --> 15:52.067
Would you consider yourself
to be psychic?

15:52.102 --> 15:56.298
I don't really know.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.500
It's really interesting
that Gillian and Aiden

15:58.535 --> 16:00.667
are having completely
different experiences

16:00.702 --> 16:02.065
in the same house.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.733
Maybe Gillian does have
some psychic ability,

16:04.768 --> 16:06.867
but who is this entity
she's sensing?

16:06.902 --> 16:08.967
We need more information
about this house

16:09.002 --> 16:11.032
and the cemetery
across the street.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.600
I'm going to meet
with a local historian

16:12.635 --> 16:14.165
to find out who's buried there.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.465
Dora Cushman,
she was 15 years old,

16:17.500 --> 16:20.165
and she's buried up there
in the cemetery.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.933
I also want to get some names
of former homeowners

16:22.968 --> 16:25.667
or anyone remotely connected
to this property.

16:25.702 --> 16:27.565
It was all Briggs
that lived up there.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.333
Well, great. I mean, this is
good information to have.

16:34.133 --> 16:37.400
Well, I learned a lot
about just some

16:37.435 --> 16:39.532
of the local history here.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.933
Most of these houses
were build by the Briggs family,

16:41.968 --> 16:43.698
Hence Briggs Hill Road.

16:43.733 --> 16:47.167
- Oh, right.
- And then the other thing is...

16:47.202 --> 16:49.701
I thought this was
an interesting story.

16:49.736 --> 16:52.200
This girl is buried
in the cemetery.

16:52.235 --> 16:54.032
Her name was
Dora Cushman,

16:54.067 --> 16:57.798
and at 15 years old
she got pregnant,

16:57.833 --> 17:02.500
and basically she was the victim
of a botched abortion.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.400
This girl is buried
in the cemetery.

17:18.435 --> 17:20.198
Her name was
Dora Cushman,

17:20.233 --> 17:24.665
and at 15 years old
she got pregnant,

17:24.700 --> 17:28.800
and basically she was the victim
of a botched abortion.

17:28.835 --> 17:31.932
She had taken cedar oil.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.883
I guess that in small doses
is enough to,

17:34.918 --> 17:37.800
like, initiate
a miscarriage-type thing,

17:37.835 --> 17:40.317
but if you take
too much you die.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.576
I mean,
this happened in 1897.

17:42.611 --> 17:44.765
What I find
interesting about it

17:44.800 --> 17:46.966
is that she's the same age
as Gillian.

17:47.001 --> 17:49.098
So another local tragedy
I learned about

17:49.133 --> 17:52.433
was the 1875 murder
of a man named Noah Thompson.

17:52.468 --> 17:54.632
Well,
at least we have names.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.417
Maybe we should go over
to the cemetery.

17:57.452 --> 18:00.167
I would love to go there
and investigate.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.433
Going out to the cemetery
that's so close to the house

18:08.468 --> 18:10.367
and seeing if any
of those names match up

18:10.402 --> 18:12.017
to anybody who
has ever lived here

18:12.052 --> 18:13.598
is going to be
beneficial to our case

18:13.633 --> 18:14.767
because if they're here,
maybe they're there,

18:14.802 --> 18:17.233
and if they're there
maybe they're here.

18:24.167 --> 18:27.667
These are old!
These look so old!

18:27.702 --> 18:29.533
My god.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.765
Cushman.
This is Dora.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.933
That's the girl
who died at 15.

18:38.968 --> 18:40.917
- 15 years, 7 months.
- Yeah.

18:40.952 --> 18:42.832
So strange
they were buried here.

18:42.867 --> 18:47.600
They owned land in Lincoln,
the next town over.

18:47.635 --> 18:48.765
Here's Briggs.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.632
So he's the one
that built the house?

18:50.667 --> 18:52.900
I think so.
I'll have to look at the deeds.

18:52.935 --> 18:54.598
Let me get this out.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.032
We don't mean to disturb
your sleep,

18:57.067 --> 19:00.067
and normally
we don't investigate cemeteries

19:00.102 --> 19:00.898
for that reason,

19:00.933 --> 19:04.833
but we think
someone is in that house

19:04.868 --> 19:07.665
that's bothering
that family,

19:07.700 --> 19:10.050
and we just want to know
if whatever

19:10.085 --> 19:12.400
is in that house
is connected here.

19:12.435 --> 19:15.851
Can you tell us
your name?

19:15.886 --> 19:19.267
Is there
a Dora Cushman here?

19:21.233 --> 19:22.700
Let's listen to this.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.298
It's quiet.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.733
All right.
Well, should we head back?

19:33.768 --> 19:34.967
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:36.733 --> 19:38.065
Since it's so quiet out here,

19:38.100 --> 19:40.967
we're going to refocus our
investigation back on the house.

19:41.002 --> 19:42.932
That's where the activity is.

19:42.967 --> 19:44.432
Well, if there's tapping
on the window,

19:44.467 --> 19:47.533
I want to bring the geophone to
see if there's any vibrations.

19:47.568 --> 19:50.133
Tonight we're going to
start in Gillian's room.

19:50.168 --> 19:52.832
- Should we try the Ovilus?
- Yeah.

19:52.867 --> 19:56.133
She's sensing a male entity
and hears knocks on her window.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.600
If this activity is really
following this family from house

19:59.635 --> 20:02.033
to house,
Gillian could be the reason.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.200
So I put a geophone
on the window.

20:06.235 --> 20:08.098
It senses vibration.

20:08.133 --> 20:11.598
She said something taps
on the window.

20:11.633 --> 20:14.000
So when something taps on
the window if we're in here,

20:14.035 --> 20:16.017
this blue light
is going to go off.

20:16.052 --> 20:18.000
This is
her drawings that she did

20:18.035 --> 20:20.598
of the ghosts
that she sees.

20:20.633 --> 20:23.332
I'm going to use this
as a trigger object,

20:23.367 --> 20:26.767
so if anything touches
this paper or gets near it,

20:26.802 --> 20:29.365
this alarm is
going to sound.

20:29.400 --> 20:33.898
I'm going to have this on that
and the Ovilus.

20:33.933 --> 20:38.133
It uses the environmental
readings to produce words.

20:38.168 --> 20:41.200
Do you know
who Gillian is?

20:42.567 --> 20:44.067
Gillian has drawn
what she sees.

20:44.102 --> 20:46.451
Do you see
what she did, here?

20:46.486 --> 20:48.800
Can you
take a closer look?

20:48.835 --> 20:52.132
Are you from Georgia?

20:52.167 --> 20:55.098
Did you come here
with Sam,

20:55.133 --> 20:59.300
or did you come here
with Gillian or Aiden?

21:09.933 --> 21:11.398
It says Aiden, right?

21:11.433 --> 21:13.567
It says Aiden
loud and clear.

21:19.467 --> 21:21.233
It says Aiden
loud and clear.

21:21.268 --> 21:22.700
Mm-hmm.

21:44.867 --> 21:47.067
It says Aiden
loud and clear.

21:47.102 --> 21:48.633
Mm-hmm.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.398
Why would it say Aiden?

21:52.433 --> 21:55.667
Of all the people to say,
why would it say Aiden?

21:55.702 --> 21:58.632
Why Aiden?

21:58.667 --> 22:01.698
Does he remind you
of someone?

22:01.733 --> 22:05.500
Let's try some of the names
from the cemetery.

22:05.535 --> 22:09.132
Is your last name Briggs?

22:09.167 --> 22:14.265
Do you know
who Dora Cushman is?

22:14.300 --> 22:18.200
Do you remember the murder
of Noah Thompson?

22:18.235 --> 22:20.067
My theory is
if I keep bringing up

22:20.102 --> 22:21.032
these newsworthy events

22:21.067 --> 22:22.900
and they remember it,
that will tell me

22:22.935 --> 22:24.698
the time period
of whoever this is.

22:24.733 --> 22:27.100
Yeah. No. I got it.
I'm on the same page.

22:27.135 --> 22:28.933
So we should probably
listen to it.

22:40.467 --> 22:43.209
Do you hear that?
It says Noah Thompson.

22:50.867 --> 22:52.165
Yeah.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.165
What was
Noah Thompson again?

22:54.200 --> 22:57.633
It was just a big murder
in town in 1871.

22:57.668 --> 23:00.567
I don't think that
Noah Thompson is here,

23:00.602 --> 23:03.432
but I'm wondering
if whatever is here

23:03.467 --> 23:08.500
is from the time period of 1871
and knows about that story.

23:08.535 --> 23:11.933
Okay, well, I mean,
a couple clues kind of.

23:11.968 --> 23:16.432
Yeah.
I'm going to sit right here.

23:16.467 --> 23:18.600
I'll come out there
with you, actually.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.900
If you're in this house,
knock on something.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.500
Can you do that for us,
please?

23:28.967 --> 23:32.565
What does it say?

23:32.600 --> 23:36.667
"Europe. Coat.
Paragraph. Found."

23:38.167 --> 23:41.267
Is there someone here
who wants to talk?

23:43.133 --> 23:46.600
The more you tell us,
the more we can help you.

23:48.733 --> 23:51.167
We'd love to know
who we're talking to.

23:51.202 --> 23:55.133
It's right...
That scared me.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.765
"Foreign."

23:57.800 --> 24:00.600
Are you
from another country?

24:00.635 --> 24:03.400
Are you following
this family?

24:05.233 --> 24:07.367
All right.
Listen to this.

24:17.167 --> 24:19.198
Hmm.

24:19.233 --> 24:24.267
What other forms
of communication can we try?

24:24.302 --> 24:25.832
If it won't talk to us,

24:25.867 --> 24:29.033
maybe it will communicate
with Gillian?

24:29.068 --> 24:31.817
Yeah, I think...
I'm, like, at a loss.

24:31.852 --> 24:34.567
Like, I know
there's something here.

24:34.602 --> 24:35.898
- Uh-huh.
- I know it is.

24:35.933 --> 24:38.867
But it's very minor
except for the fire.

24:38.902 --> 24:41.498
Except for the fire
which...

24:41.533 --> 24:42.967
We should probably
check that out and see.

24:43.002 --> 24:44.198
Yeah.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.433
The fire is really
terrifying to this family,

24:47.468 --> 24:48.898
so we're going to run a test.

24:48.933 --> 24:50.800
We're going to place
the same type of candles

24:50.835 --> 24:52.451
that started the fire in a tray

24:52.486 --> 24:55.009
connected to
our proximity sensor

24:55.044 --> 24:57.498
and see if it
goes off on its own.

24:57.533 --> 25:02.533
So whoever is here with us,
the owners of the house

25:02.568 --> 25:06.100
seem to think you might have
started a fire

25:06.135 --> 25:08.032
with these candles.

25:08.067 --> 25:11.032
The one thing I notice
about these...

25:11.067 --> 25:15.067
Does that seem like a different
material than a normal...

25:15.102 --> 25:16.667
Like, let me get
a regular tea light.

25:16.702 --> 25:18.598
Yeah,
because we have both.

25:18.633 --> 25:20.800
I want to compare the candle
the family used

25:20.835 --> 25:22.932
with a more
generic brand.

25:22.967 --> 25:27.400
First thing I notice...
The warning label for these,

25:27.435 --> 25:31.833
the family's candle,
is far more intense than these.

25:31.868 --> 25:33.032
"Burn within sight."

25:33.067 --> 25:35.165
Keep away from things
that catch fire.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.250
"Place on a protected
heat-resistant, level surface."

25:39.285 --> 25:43.300
This candle doesn't have
those first two bold sentences.

25:43.335 --> 25:47.401
Hand me that blue hockey mask
right there.

25:47.436 --> 25:51.467
Like, this styrofoam,
highly flammable...

25:51.502 --> 25:52.532
Yeah.

25:52.567 --> 25:56.767
...so it's just going
to melt and smolder,

25:56.802 --> 25:59.465
and once it went up,
it went up.

25:59.500 --> 26:03.032
You know, tea lights
are a very innocent candle,

26:03.067 --> 26:08.333
yet it only takes one instance
for you to set it somewhere

26:08.368 --> 26:09.700
and just be like,
"It's going to be fine"

26:09.735 --> 26:11.665
and it not be okay.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.067
Does anyone know
about the accident

26:14.102 --> 26:17.865
that happened
with the candle?

26:17.900 --> 26:20.683
Did you come try
to warn the family?

26:20.718 --> 26:23.467
Is that why you
banged on the door?

26:23.502 --> 26:24.932
What if
that's what it was?

26:24.967 --> 26:29.067
There was four loud bangs
on the outside door.

26:29.102 --> 26:30.433
Well, Kelley said
that it sounded, like,

26:30.468 --> 26:32.398
as if a neighbor
was coming to...

26:32.433 --> 26:34.833
- Check on them.
- ...Make sure they were okay.

26:34.868 --> 26:35.932
Huh.

26:35.967 --> 26:37.733
I mean, what's more
neighborly than a ghost

26:37.768 --> 26:39.067
that lives in your house?

26:39.102 --> 26:41.167
Right.

26:45.867 --> 26:48.365
We feel pretty confident
the fire was natural,

26:48.400 --> 26:52.200
but I'll send the photos
to a fireman I know to confirm.

26:52.235 --> 26:55.065
Whoever is here refuses
to talk with us.

26:55.100 --> 26:58.200
Tonight, we'll include
Gillian in the investigation.

26:58.235 --> 27:00.265
We also called in Stephanie.

27:00.300 --> 27:03.067
She's a psychic who can
help identify the activity,

27:03.102 --> 27:04.498
and also work with Gillian,

27:04.533 --> 27:07.467
who we think
may be psychic, as well.

27:08.733 --> 27:10.067
Well, why don't you tell me
some of the things

27:10.102 --> 27:11.198
that you're experiencing?

27:11.233 --> 27:17.867
Five years ago,
I started sensing this man

27:17.902 --> 27:19.767
who was always
standing at my door,

27:19.802 --> 27:23.165
and he had
a very negative...

27:23.200 --> 27:24.533
You're seeing them inside
your mind's eye.

27:24.568 --> 27:25.765
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.050
It's actually very rare
to see them physically,

27:28.085 --> 27:30.300
but it sounds like
what you're experiencing

27:30.335 --> 27:32.600
is psychic phenomenon.

27:37.067 --> 27:39.567
We wanted to have
Gillian lead the way.

27:39.602 --> 27:42.798
Yeah.

27:42.833 --> 27:46.100
Do you feel anything
in this room, or...

27:46.135 --> 27:48.032
Kind of.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.532
It's...
I don't feel a person.

27:49.567 --> 27:53.067
I just feel, like,
almost a weird energy

27:53.102 --> 27:55.584
from where, like,
the fire was.

27:55.619 --> 27:58.032
What do you feel in here?
Anything?

27:58.067 --> 28:00.332
When I walked right in,
I felt the fire,

28:00.367 --> 28:03.767
but I immediately wanted
to go upstairs when I walked in,

28:03.802 --> 28:06.798
so I was feeling
some energy upstairs.

28:06.833 --> 28:08.800
And Gillian, if you pick up
on anything, call it out.

28:08.835 --> 28:10.067
- Okay.
- Call it out.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.067
I can't stop
looking at that corner.

28:26.300 --> 28:30.533
I looked over there, and I just,
like, felt sick to my stomach.

28:30.568 --> 28:33.333
There's a guy sitting
the corner drinking whiskey.

28:51.333 --> 28:55.765
I can't stop looking
at that corner.

28:55.800 --> 29:00.067
I looked over there, and I just,
like, felt sick to my stomach.

29:00.102 --> 29:02.933
There's a guy sitting
the corner drinking whiskey.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.798
How old is he?

29:11.833 --> 29:15.667
I want to say, like,
40s-ish.

29:15.702 --> 29:17.098
- You agree?
- Mm-hmm.

29:17.133 --> 29:20.833
That's around the age
of the man I sensed.

29:20.868 --> 29:22.867
Is it the same person?

29:27.333 --> 29:29.298
Excuse me, sir.

29:29.333 --> 29:32.700
I don't mean to bother you.
I know you're kind of relaxing.

29:32.735 --> 29:36.067
We'd like to ask you a couple
of questions if we could.

29:36.102 --> 29:39.067
Can you tell us
your name, sir?

29:39.102 --> 29:41.317
We don't recognize you.

29:41.352 --> 29:43.533
Are you from this area?

29:44.900 --> 29:47.932
He wants to know
what we're doing here.

29:47.967 --> 29:51.700
We're here because we're looking
for a man who our friend,

29:51.735 --> 29:55.765
Gillian, has seen,

29:55.800 --> 29:58.100
and we feel like
he might have come

29:58.135 --> 30:00.400
from somewhere else
and followed her.

30:00.435 --> 30:03.498
Is that you?

30:03.533 --> 30:07.700
He's talking about gambling,
playing cards, and poker chips.

30:07.735 --> 30:09.067
That's weird.

30:09.102 --> 30:11.665
Yeah.

30:11.700 --> 30:12.965
So you know
why we're here.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.300
We're here to check up
on our friend, Gillian.

30:16.335 --> 30:20.098
Can you tell us why you're here?

30:20.133 --> 30:22.133
He just said,
"You don't have the time."

30:26.500 --> 30:29.865
Did you
build this house?

30:29.900 --> 30:33.933
He's fresh, like,
inappropriately fresh.

30:33.968 --> 30:37.967
Do you feel like
he came with the house?

30:38.002 --> 30:39.065
I think he wandered in.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.833
I don't feel necessarily
connected to the house,

30:41.868 --> 30:43.467
but I feel like
he's comfortable here.

30:43.502 --> 30:45.032
He wants no part
of telling us anything.

30:45.067 --> 30:48.200
I think we should move into
Gillian's room so it's...

30:52.133 --> 30:55.283
I keep looking over
at like the staircase.

30:55.318 --> 30:58.398
I feel, like,
something is, like, there.

30:58.433 --> 30:59.600
- He's still out there.
- Is it the same guy?

30:59.635 --> 31:01.132
Mm-hmm.

31:01.167 --> 31:05.700
It's, like, every time I look
out the door, I just feel sick.

31:05.735 --> 31:07.898
Let's use this
for a second and see.

31:07.933 --> 31:12.067
So what this does is
this scans through frequencies,

31:12.102 --> 31:13.398
like FM frequencies,

31:13.433 --> 31:16.083
and sometimes
they can manipulate the audio

31:16.118 --> 31:18.733
and kind of say words
or sentences to us.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.732
So see this.
Prove that you can talk to us.

31:23.767 --> 31:27.067
Go ahead, and use that device,
and tell us your name.

31:27.102 --> 31:29.700
What if I go sit in
the chair across from him?

31:34.767 --> 31:37.767
Go ahead. As loud as you can,
tell us why you're here.

31:42.633 --> 31:45.433
Is there someone
you're here with?

31:49.200 --> 31:52.800
Do you want
some more whiskey?

31:54.800 --> 31:57.167
- Whiskey.
- I heard that.

31:59.367 --> 32:01.098
Whiskey.

32:01.133 --> 32:04.300
Oh, I just
got the chills.

32:06.533 --> 32:10.700
I love that that's
the one thing he can communicate

32:10.735 --> 32:12.832
to us is whiskey.

32:12.867 --> 32:15.800
I feel like
he's done with this thing.

32:15.835 --> 32:17.498
Yeah.

32:17.533 --> 32:21.733
I thought I saw something move
in the room across the hall.

32:21.768 --> 32:24.200
There is an older woman
sitting in the rocker.

32:26.567 --> 32:29.667
What's the time period
on her would you say?

32:29.702 --> 32:32.832
I'd say
probably late 1800s.

32:32.867 --> 32:35.167
As soon as
she showed up, he ran.

32:35.202 --> 32:36.865
- He left?
- Yeah.

32:36.900 --> 32:40.167
It's probably because she
belongs here, and he doesn't.

32:40.202 --> 32:43.367
- Okay. - That's what I
would get from it.

32:43.402 --> 32:45.001
It was almost, like, instant.

32:45.036 --> 32:46.565
That device I just put there,

32:46.600 --> 32:49.767
that can hear you
even if we can't, okay?

32:49.802 --> 32:53.933
She's sitting there knitting.

32:53.968 --> 32:57.432
Very peaceful.

32:57.467 --> 33:01.067
That was my
great-grandmother's chair.

33:01.102 --> 33:01.765
Yeah.
Oh.

33:01.800 --> 33:02.533
- What's her name?
- Fernie.

33:02.568 --> 33:08.698
Fernie, is that you?

33:08.733 --> 33:12.233
She's driving out
what that was.

33:12.268 --> 33:13.465
Really?

33:13.500 --> 33:16.365
Almost like protection.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.367
Could she be doing that
periodically for a while?

33:19.402 --> 33:20.465
I mean, because...

33:20.500 --> 33:22.200
I would say so,
because literally the minute

33:22.235 --> 33:23.598
I saw movement,

33:23.633 --> 33:27.067
he looked at me wide-eyed
and gone, right out the window.

33:27.102 --> 33:28.698
It was a very strong
presence from her,

33:28.733 --> 33:33.800
so I'm assuming that's why
he's not a big fan of it.

33:33.835 --> 33:36.498
Is your name Fernie?

33:36.533 --> 33:40.467
Do you watch over Gillian
and Kelley and Sam?

33:42.700 --> 33:45.367
If you're not Fernie,
can you tell us your name

33:45.402 --> 33:47.532
so we get it right?

33:47.567 --> 33:50.100
How are you feeling,
Gillian?

33:50.135 --> 33:51.498
I feel okay.

33:51.533 --> 33:54.367
Let's listen to this.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.467
I think
it's time to stop.

34:11.502 --> 34:12.764
That's so weird.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.067
I think maybe we can
let these ladies go...

34:14.101 --> 34:15.032
Yeah.

34:15.067 --> 34:17.165
...and then we can
just continue on.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.766
Gillian's great-grandmother
is not responding,

34:19.802 --> 34:21.697
so it could be somebody else.

34:21.733 --> 34:24.233
Adam and I are going to
continue looking for evidence

34:24.268 --> 34:26.465
without Stephanie and Gillian.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.500
We'll give
the master bedroom one last try

34:28.534 --> 34:30.500
because that's where
they have voices.

34:32.632 --> 34:35.800
Let's try some of the names
from the cemetery again.

34:35.835 --> 34:38.864
We're looking for...

34:38.900 --> 34:43.167
Someone who...
Maybe lived here

34:43.202 --> 34:45.532
for a long time.

34:45.567 --> 34:49.016
Were you related
to any of the Briggs family?

34:49.052 --> 34:52.467
How about the girl
who died during the abortion?

34:52.502 --> 34:55.199
Do you know
why the Cushman family

34:55.224 --> 34:57.199
was buried in this cemetery

34:57.200 --> 35:00.898
and not one closer
to their home in Lincoln?

35:00.933 --> 35:05.367
It seemed like you may have
recognized Noah Thompson?

35:05.402 --> 35:08.233
Do you remember
that murder?

35:20.067 --> 35:21.798
<i>Was there someone here...</i>

35:21.833 --> 35:23.567
- That was something.
- It said "Lincoln."

35:23.602 --> 35:24.867
Yeah, 100%.

35:45.733 --> 35:47.032
<i>Was there someone here...</i>

35:47.067 --> 35:49.700
- That was something.
- It said "Lincoln."

35:49.735 --> 35:51.133
Yeah, 100%.

35:57.067 --> 35:58.332
"Lincoln."

35:58.367 --> 36:00.067
<i>Was there someone here
they were connected to?</i>

36:00.102 --> 36:01.867
It doesn't sound
it's Dora herself,

36:01.902 --> 36:07.633
Lincoln, which is a local town.

36:07.668 --> 36:09.332
Right.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.850
It makes me think
it's a local person.

36:11.885 --> 36:14.333
Mm-hmm.
It didn't travel here with them.

36:14.368 --> 36:15.365
No.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.733
I think whatever is here
is in and out,

36:17.768 --> 36:20.067
and I think Gillian
has psychic abilities.

36:20.102 --> 36:21.901
I'd love
to find out who's here,

36:21.936 --> 36:23.665
but I don't think
it's anything

36:23.700 --> 36:26.767
that's trying to get
some crazy message across.

36:26.802 --> 36:28.132
She's going to
experience activity.

36:28.167 --> 36:31.598
I mean, there is a cemetery
across the street.

36:31.633 --> 36:35.067
I'm ready to talk to these guys,
and let them know.

36:38.067 --> 36:40.800
This has been one
of the most challenging cases

36:40.835 --> 36:42.598
we've ever investigated.

36:42.633 --> 36:45.267
We've had experiences
with multiple entities,

36:45.302 --> 36:48.065
but no spirit
wants to deliver a message

36:48.100 --> 36:50.933
however, we still have
plenty to tell the family,

36:50.968 --> 36:53.032
especially when it comes
to Gillian.

36:53.067 --> 36:56.300
First of all, we wanted
to figure out the fire.

36:56.335 --> 36:57.298
Right.

36:57.333 --> 36:59.598
We focused on trying
to figure out

36:59.633 --> 37:03.398
how things could have
happened naturally.

37:03.433 --> 37:06.233
I consulted with
a captain of a fire department.

37:06.268 --> 37:08.398
I sent him all your photos.

37:08.433 --> 37:12.200
He said those candles
absolutely lit that fire.

37:12.235 --> 37:14.665
They lit something nearby,

37:14.700 --> 37:17.400
either the styrofoam inside
one of the hockey masks

37:17.435 --> 37:19.332
or part of the shelf itself,

37:19.367 --> 37:22.300
and it probably
smoldered for a while

37:22.335 --> 37:23.533
before it actually ignited...

37:23.568 --> 37:24.532
Right.
Mm-hmm.

37:24.567 --> 37:27.167
...so I would say 100%
you can rule out

37:27.202 --> 37:29.767
something trying to
burn your house down.

37:29.802 --> 37:31.032
Yes. 100%.

37:31.067 --> 37:33.400
You know, I'd rather feel stupid
for lighting a candle

37:33.435 --> 37:35.584
than anything else.
Right.

37:35.619 --> 37:37.733
It's such a huge relief.

37:37.768 --> 37:38.765
Yeah.

37:38.800 --> 37:39.867
I mean, you were
sleeping in shifts.

37:39.902 --> 37:41.367
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right.

37:41.402 --> 37:43.365
I'm sorry.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.666
This whole weight
just came off, you know?

37:46.701 --> 37:49.933
I know.
I would be the exact same way.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.334
So you're good.
You're good.

37:51.369 --> 37:52.665
- Yes.
- Good. Thank you.

37:52.700 --> 37:55.767
But that doesn't mean
your house isn't haunted.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.698
So let's talk
about that.

38:00.733 --> 38:02.716
During our investigation
we had experiences.

38:02.751 --> 38:04.825
Like, we were investigating
in your office,

38:04.860 --> 38:07.113
and we heard
what sounded like footsteps.

38:07.148 --> 38:09.367
We also recorded an EVP
in Gillian's room

38:09.402 --> 38:11.333
that might surprise you.

38:16.933 --> 38:18.767
- Right.
- Oh, I hear it now.

38:18.802 --> 38:20.134
- Right.
- Yep.

38:20.169 --> 38:21.432
And it's clear.

38:21.467 --> 38:26.133
For some reason this person
either had taken liking to him,

38:26.168 --> 38:28.067
or was just repeating
what I said.

38:28.102 --> 38:30.298
Or maybe
they're frustrated

38:30.333 --> 38:32.267
because he doesn't
give them the time of day.

38:32.302 --> 38:34.465
So last night,
we brought in Stephanie,

38:34.500 --> 38:37.167
and she's a psychic
that we sometimes work with.

38:37.202 --> 38:38.832
Stephanie picked up on a woman

38:38.867 --> 38:41.398
sitting in that
rocking chair upstairs.

38:41.433 --> 38:45.150
I know that was something
that was passed on to you.

38:45.185 --> 38:48.867
She said she was kind of
a protective presence almost.

38:48.902 --> 38:52.967
Then she also sensed a man
sitting upstairs,

38:53.002 --> 38:56.165
just kind of
an unsavory character,

38:56.200 --> 38:59.333
but as soon as that older
woman came into light,

38:59.368 --> 39:00.832
he bolted,

39:00.867 --> 39:05.867
and so it's almost like she has
sort of stake in the house.

39:05.902 --> 39:09.900
That also makes us wonder
if after you had the fire

39:09.935 --> 39:11.400
why somebody would be
banging on the door?

39:11.435 --> 39:12.365
Right.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.233
Maybe she was trying
to check on you.

39:15.268 --> 39:18.050
With all this,
I'm sure you're wondering

39:18.085 --> 39:20.833
is it connected
to your previous houses?

39:20.868 --> 39:22.617
- Or with Gillian?
- Right.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.332
What we think
is happening here

39:24.367 --> 39:26.700
is everything else
from your past houses,

39:26.735 --> 39:28.498
I don't think
that's here with you.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.183
We definitely believe
that Georgia was Georgia,

39:31.218 --> 39:33.833
and this is Vermont,
and you wanted the new lease,

39:33.868 --> 39:35.532
and you got it.

39:35.567 --> 39:37.498
Now let's talk about
Gillian.

39:37.533 --> 39:39.798
We brought her on
the investigation with us,

39:39.833 --> 39:43.500
and she picked up
on the same things as Stephanie.

39:43.535 --> 39:45.865
What we think
is going on with Gillian

39:45.900 --> 39:48.533
is she definitely does
have actual psychic,

39:48.568 --> 39:51.132
medium-type abilities.

39:51.167 --> 39:52.933
Where do we go
from here with her?

39:52.968 --> 39:54.065
I know.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.032
Stephanie will give her
some answers there

39:56.067 --> 39:58.967
as far as how she should
handle it from here on out.

39:59.002 --> 40:03.133
How much of a concern
should we have for...

40:03.168 --> 40:05.098
From creepy, old,
drunk gamblers...

40:05.133 --> 40:08.116
- ...creepy...
- ...by our daughter's bed.

40:08.151 --> 40:11.100
You know, I would say
this guy really wanted

40:11.135 --> 40:12.865
nothing to do with us.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.432
I would say not to worry
about him.

40:15.467 --> 40:18.200
These older homes,
we find that people come in

40:18.235 --> 40:19.133
and out of them all the time.

40:19.168 --> 40:20.332
Right.

40:20.367 --> 40:21.998
Especially if they are
familiar with the area.

40:22.033 --> 40:25.166
And you have a cemetery,
you know, right down the street,

40:25.201 --> 40:28.300
so they may see your home
as a revolving door almost.

40:28.335 --> 40:29.598
Okay.

40:29.633 --> 40:32.167
You know, usually we find out
who's haunting the place.

40:32.202 --> 40:35.701
We have an identity for you,
and in this case

40:35.736 --> 40:39.200
because these ghosts
aren't really reaching out,

40:39.235 --> 40:41.365
we have no idea
who they are.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.132
You know, this was
more about you and Gillian,

40:43.167 --> 40:45.033
and these ghosts are just
going about their business.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.332
Business.
Right.

40:46.367 --> 40:48.367
The biggest thing is
that Gillian has direction

40:48.402 --> 40:51.100
and understanding
of what she needs to do.

40:51.135 --> 40:52.800
And we're safe
in our home, so...

40:52.835 --> 40:54.833
- Yes. For sure.
- Yeah.

40:56.567 --> 40:59.367
Before we leave, I wanted
you to talk with Stephanie.

40:59.402 --> 41:02.198
Get some ideas
on how to handle things.

41:02.233 --> 41:04.850
Everything is up to you,
how far you want to take this.

41:04.885 --> 41:07.467
The best advice that I can give
is every single day

41:07.502 --> 41:08.967
when you wake up,
you're going to pretend

41:09.002 --> 41:11.151
that there is
a bubble around you,

41:11.186 --> 41:13.265
and nobody
can come inside that space.

41:13.300 --> 41:16.600
That stops other people's energy
from getting into you.

41:16.635 --> 41:18.567
If that guy is sitting
outside your bedroom

41:18.602 --> 41:20.365
or anybody that
you don't want here,

41:20.400 --> 41:22.133
just make sure
to just tell them to go away.

41:22.168 --> 41:23.900
- Right.
- It's your space.

41:23.935 --> 41:25.465
This is your home now.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.167
They have to respect
who you are,

41:27.202 --> 41:28.684
and why you're here.
Yeah.

41:28.719 --> 41:30.167
So don't ever
be afraid of it.

41:30.202 --> 41:31.332
All right.

41:31.367 --> 41:35.233
The stronger you are
and you project that strength,

41:35.268 --> 41:37.200
that will definitely
make them back off.

41:37.235 --> 41:38.365
Yeah.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.400
It's the beginning
of good things for you.

41:40.435 --> 41:44.067
- Yeah. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

41:44.102 --> 41:46.232
The difference in the family

41:46.267 --> 41:49.100
four days ago
versus now is huge,

41:49.135 --> 41:51.900
and it is why we do this.
